the

of
rockland
for
some
years
past
the
condition
of
the
lobster
fishery
of
new
england
has
excited
the
earnest
attention
of
all
interested
in
the
preservation
of
one
of
the
most
valuable
crustaceans
of
our
country
in
the
state
of
maine
particularly
where
the
industry
is
of
the
first
importance
the
steady
decline
from
year
to
year
has
caused
the
gravest
fears
and
incessant
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
united
states
fish
commission
in
conjunction
with
the
state
fish
commission
of
maine
to
overcome
this
decline
this

presents
the
results
of
an
investigation

i
am

to
so
many

extended
that
it

the
first
steam
smack
to
carry
lobsters
in
a
well
natural
history
of
the
lobster
although
the
lobster
has
been
of
great
value
to
the
new
england
states
and
the
british
provinces
as
a
food
commodity
but
little
was
known
of
its
and
habits
until
within
the
last
few
years
to
this
ignorance
has
been
due
quite
largely
peculiar
and
in
some
instances
useless
laws
enacted
by
some
states
the
gradual
enlightenment
of
the
public
on
this
subject
has
borne
good
fruit
however
and
most
of
the
present
state
laws
are
founded
on
substantial
facts
instead
of
theories
francis
herrick
has
been
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
investigators
and
his
summary
of
the
present
knowledge
on
this
subject
is
quoted
below
from
the
fish
commission
bulletin
for
the
fishery
is
declining
and
this
decline
is
due
to
the
persistence
with
which
it
has
been
conducted
during
the
last
years
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
animal
is
being
driven
to
the
wall
by
any
new
or
unusual
disturbance
of
the
forces
of
nature
the
lobster
is
migratory
only
to
the
extent
of
moving
to
and
from
the
shore
and
is
therefore
practically
a
sedentary
animal
its
movements
are
governed
chiefly
by
the
abundance
of
food
and
the
temperature
of
the
water
the
female
may
be
impregnated
or
provided
with
a
supply
of
sperm
for
future
use
by
the
male
at
any
time
and
the
sperm
which
is
deposited
in
an
external
pouch
or
sperm
receptacle
has
remarkable
vitality
copulation
occurs
commonly
in
spring
and
the
eggs
are
fertilized
outside
the
body
female
lobsters
become
sexually
mature
when
from
to
inches
long
the
majority
of
all
lobsters
inches
long
are
mature
it
is
rare
to
find
a
female
less
than
inches
long
which
has
spawned
or
one
over
inches
in
length
which
has
never
borne
eggs
the
spawning
interval
is
a
biennial
one
two
years
elapsing
between
each
period
of
the
spawning
period
for
the
majority
of
lobsters
is
july
and
august
a
few
lay
eggs
at
other
seasons
of
the
year
in
the
fall
winter
and
probably
in
the
spring
the
period
of
spawning
lasts
about
six
weeks
and
fluctuates
slightly
from
year
to
year
the
individual
variation
in
the
time
of
extrusion
of
ova
is
explained
by
the
long
period
during
which
the
eggs
attain
the
limits
of
growth
anything
which
affects
the
vital
condition
of
the
female
during
this
period
of
two
years
may
affect
the
time
of
spawning
the
spawning
period
in
the
middle
and
eastern
districts
of
maine
is
two
weeks
later
than
in
vineyard
sound
massachusetts
in
per
cent
of
eggs
examined
from
the
coast
of
maine
were
extruded
in
the
first
half
of
august
the
number
of
eggs
laid
varies
with
the
size
of
the
animal
the
law
of
production
may
be
arithmetically
expressed
as
follows
number
of
eggs
produced
at
each
reproductive
period
varies
in
a
geometrical
series
while
the
length
of
lobsters
producing
these
eggs
varies
in
an
arithmetical
according
to
this
law
an
lobster
produces
eggs
a
lobster
inches
long
a
lobster
this
high
rate
of
production
is
not
maintained
beyond
the
length
of
to
inches
the
largest
number
of
eggs
recorded
for
a
female
is
a
lobster
inches
long
produces
on
the
average
nearly
eggs
the
period
of
incubation
of
summer
eggs
at
woods
hole
is
about
ten
months
july
to
may
the
hatching
of
a
single
brood
lasts
about
a
week
owing
to
the
slightly
unequal
rate
of
development
of
individual
eggs
the
hatching
period
varies
also
with
the
time
of
lobsters
having
rarely
been
known
to
hatch
in
november
and
february
taking
all
things
into
consideration
the
sexes
appear
about
equally
divided
though
the
relative
numbers
caught
in
certain
places
at
certain
times
of
the
year
may
be
remarkably
variable
molting
commonly
occurs
from
june
to
september
but
there
is
no
month
of
the
year
in
which
soft
lobsters
may
not
be
caught
the
male
probably
molts
oftener
than
the
female
in
the
adult
female
the
molting
like
the
spawning
period
is
a
biennial
one
but
the
two
periods
are
one
year
apart
as
a
rule
the
female
lays
her
eggs
in
july
carries
them
until
the
following
summer
when
they
hatch
then
she
molts
possibly
a
second
molt
may
occur
in
the
fall
winter
or
spring
but
it
is
not
probable
and
molting
just
before
the
production
of
new
eggs
is
rare
the
female
with
eggs
removed
weighs
less
than
the
female
of
the
same
length
without
eggs
the
new
shell
becomes
thoroughly
hard
in
the
course
of
from
six
to
eight
weeks
the
length
of
time
requisite
for
this
varying
with
the
food
and
other
conditions
of
the
animal
the
young
after
hatching
cut
loose
from
their
mother
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
lead
a
free
life
as
pelagic
larvae
the
first
larva
is
about
of
an
inch
long
mm
the
swimming
period
lasts
from
six
to
eight
weeks
or
until
the
lobster
has
molted
five
or
at
most
six
times
and
is
of
an
inch
long
when
it
sinks
to
the
bottom
it
now
travels
toward
the
shore
and
if
fortunate
establishes
itself
in
the
rock
piles
of
inlets
of
harbors
where
it
remains
until
driven
out
by
ice
in
the
fall
or
early
winter
the

down
among
the
loose
stones
which
are
often
exposed
at
low
tides
at
a
later
period
when
to
inches
long
they
come
out
of
their
retreats
and
explore
the
bottom
occasionally
hiding
or
burrowing
under
stones
young
lobsters
have
also
been
found
in
eelgrass
and
on
sandy
bottoms
in
shallow
water
the
food
of
the
larva
consists
of
minute
pelagic
organisms
the
food
of
the
older
and
adult
stages
is
largely
of
animal
origin
with
but
slight
addition
of
vegetable
material
consisting
chiefly
of
fish
and
invertebrates
of
various
kinds

molts
from
to
times
at

the
lobster
has
molted
to
times
and
is
about
years
old
as
the
purpose
of
this
article
is
to
deal
more
particularly
with
the
commercial
side
of
the
lobster
question
all
interested
more
particularly
in
the
natural
history
of
the
animal
are
referred
to

by

fish
com
for
pp
history
of
the
fishery
ever
since
the
early
puritan
settlers
first
learned
from
the
indians
how
to
utilize
the
lobster
it
has
been
one
of
the
most
prized
articles
of
food
in
the
new
england
states
the
early
town
records
of
massachusetts
contain
frequent
references
to
this
valuable
crustacean
and
efforts
were
made
at
an
early
day
to
conserve
the
supply
at
first
as
most
settlers
lived
on
or
near
the
coast
each
family
could
easily
secure
its
own
supply
but
as
the
settlements
gradually
extended
farther
inland
this
became
inconvenient
and
it
soon
became
customary
for
certain
persons
living
on
the
coast
to
attend
to
supplying
the
wants
of
the
inland
settlers
and
thus
the
commercial
fishery
was
established
the
coast
of
maine
is
very
favorably
situated
for
this
fishery
in
its
eastern
and
middle
sections
the
shore
is
bold
and
rocky
while
it
is
cut
up
by
large
deep
inlets
and
coves
which
are
studded
with
numerous
islands
large
and
small
and
by
bold
rocky
promontories
groups
of
islands
are
also
numerous
farther
off
shore
like
the
fox
and
matinicus
islands
deer
and
mount
desert
islands
large
and
small
rivers
are
numerous
and
the
granite
bottoms
of
these
channels
and
inlets
form
admirable
breeding
grounds
in
the
western
end
the
shores
are
not
so
rocky
being
broken
frequently
with
sandy
reaches
while
the
rivers
are
small
and
comparatively
shallow
west
of
casco
bay
the
islands
are
infrequent
as
a
result
of
this
conformation
of
coast
the
best
fishing
grounds
in
maine
are
between
cape
elizabeth
and
quoddy
head
as
early
as
smacks
from
boston
and
connecticut
visited
harpswell
for
fresh
lobsters
and
it
is
very
probable
that
even
before
this
time
they
had
visited
the
points
farther
west
in
the
state
as
the
history
of
the
fishery
so
far
as
known
shows
that
it
gradually
worked
to
the
eastward
this
was
doubtless
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
trend
of
settlement
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
was
in
that
direction
it
is
also
probable
that
for
some
time
before
the
people
along
the
coast
took
up
the
fishery
the
smackmen
themselves
did
their
own
fishing
this
is
easily
believed
when
the
great
abundance
is
considered
it
is
known
that
this
was
done
in
massachusetts
during
summer
the
lobsters
were
very
common
close
in
shore
and
could
easily
be
gaffed
by
boys
at
low
water
but
this
could
hardly
be
called
a
regular
fishery
the
regular
fishery
began
with
the
use
of
pots
which
were
generally
of
very
rude
construction
and
the
facility
with
which
the
lobsters
escaped
from
them
led
to
their
disuse
soon
after
the
lath
pots
began
to
be
introduced
the
lath
pots
were
essentially
the
same
in
construction
as
those
now
used
on
the
coast
of
maine
and
each
pair
of
fishermen
then
handled
between
and
up
to
about
it
was
the
custom
to
set
the
traps
singly
and
two
men
were
usually
employed
in
the
fishery
one
to
haul
up
empty
the
pot
rebait
it
and
drop
it
overboard
while
the
other
handled
the
boat
in
the
latter
year
it
was
discovered
that
by
setting
the
pots
on
trawls
more
pots
could
be
set
and
only
one
man
would
be
required
to
work
them
this
invention
which
was
claimed
by
several
different
persons
proved
quite
successful
for
a
while
but
after
a
time
when
the
supply
of
lobsters
began
to
drop
off
better
results
were
secured
by
scattering
the
pots
over
a
greater
area
and
shifting
their
position
each
time
they
were
fished
which
was
very
easily
done
as
a
result
of
this
the
use
of
trawls
decreased
very
rapidly

following

in

began
to
obtain

ridges
leaving
harpswell
entirely
on
account
of
the
small
size
of
the

then
being
caught
there
at
this
time
the
average
weight
of
the
lobsters
marketed
was
about
pounds
and
all
under
inches
in
length
were
rejected
the
traps
were
made
of
the

size
as
at

were
constructed
of
round
oak
sticks
and
with
four
hoops
or
bows
to
support
the
upper

a
string
of
bait
consisting
mainly
of
flounders

lines
by
which
the

lobsters
were
so
abundant
at
the

at
this
period
that
four
men
could
fully
supply
captain
oakes
with
lobsters
every

in
the
course
of
ten
days
each

would
obtain

in
captain
opinion
the
muscle
ridges
have
furnished
the
most
extensive
lobster
fishery
of
the
maine
coast
he
ran
to
this
locality
until
capt
davis
of
south
saint
george
states
that
about
when
he
first
began
buying
lobsters
at
the
muscle
ridges
three
men
tending
to
pots
each
caught
all
the
count
lobsters
he
could
carry
to
market
in
his
smack
he
could
load
lobsters
at
a
time
and
averaged
a
trip
in
to
days
this
traffic
continued
for
six
or
seven
years
in
captain
davis
bought
from
men
in
the
same
locality
and
at
times
was
obliged
to
buy
also
of
others
in
order
to
make
up
a
load
the
fishery
at
north
haven
began
in
but
did
not
increase
so
rapidly
at
first
as
in
sections
farther
west
as
the
smacks
would
only
take
the
lobsters
fearing
that
the
largest
would
not
be
able
to
stand
the
trip
at
matinicus
island
the
fishing
began
in
in
the
people
on
deer
island
began
the
fishery
and
as
the
smackmen
made
frequent
visits
the
business
rapidly
increased
the
establishment
of
a
cannery
at
oceanville
about
also
caused
a
considerable
development
of
the
fishery
the
fishery
was
started
at
isle
an
haute
about
and
at
swan
island
in
the
early
fifties
the
canning
of
lobsters
was
first
carried
on
at
eastport
in
but
the
fishery
was
not
taken
up
until
about
as
it
was
supposed
there
were
no
lobsters
in
the
neighborhood
the
supplies
for
these
canneries
previous
to
the
inception
of
the
fishery
were
obtained
by
smacks
running
to
the
westward
for
some
years
the
fishery
was
only
prosecuted
in
the
late
spring
summer
and
early
fall
months
just
when
winter
fishing
began
in
the
state
is
doubtful
but
according
to
capt
charles
black
of
orr
island
it
began
in
that
region
in
at
harpswell
previously
the
fishermen
had
the
impression
that
lobsters
could
not
be
successfully
caught
earlier
than
march
during
the
summer
of
the
captains
of
the
of

london
who
bought
most
of
the

in

vicinity

fish
during
the
winter
and
they
set
their
traps
about
the
same
distance
from
the
shore
that
the
fishermen
do
at
present
and
in
almost
the
same
depth
of
water
the
smackmen
paid
them
for
lobsters
the
next
winter
the
fishermen
refused
to
sell
by
number
and
wanted
per
pounds
the
smackmen
had
no
objection
to
buy
them
by
weight
but
refused
to
pay
more
than
per
pounds
this
was
accepted
and
for
several
years
the
prices
were
from
to
per
pounds
comparatively
few
traps
were
necessary
then
as
when
the
weather
would
permit
the
fishermen
to
tend
their
traps
they
would
catch
from
to
lobsters
daily
and
frequently
when
the
traps
were
hauled
they
would
find
several
lobsters
clinging
to
some
part
of
the
pots
the
bait
was
very
plentiful
and
caught
with
spears
the
lobsters
were
placed
in
cars
at
that
time
after
having
been
plugged
to
keep
them
from
injuring
each
other
the
plugs
were
almost
inches
long
flat
on
one
side
round
on
the
other
and
with
a
sharp
point
plugging
has
since
been
discontinued
as
the
trifling
injury
the
lobsters
did
each
other
was
nothing
compared
to
the
value
of

the
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
comparative
value
of
the
grounds
in
the
state
owing
to
the
movements
of
the
lobsters
in
the
early
spring
in
april
or
may
as
the
waters
in
the
bays
and
rivers
warm
up
the
lobsters
come
into
the
comparatively
shallow
waters
they
remain
here
until
late
in
the
fall
going
back
to
the
ocean
or
deep
waters
of
the
bays
in
either
october
or
november
they
love
to
congregate
on
rocky
bottom
and
pots
set
on
such
bottom
will
frequently
make
large
catches
while
those
on
sandy
or
muddy
ground
will
catch
almost
nothing
in
the
early
years
of
the
fishery
they
came
in
very
close
in
great
numbers
and
could
frequently
be
taken
at
low
water
in
dip
nets
or
by
gaffs
but
they
are
now
found
in
summer
in
depths
of
from
to
fathoms
in
the
numerous
passages
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
and
the
lower
reaches
of
the
bays
and
rivers
for
a
number
of
years
winter
fishing
was
not
prosecuted
but
now
it
is
a
very
important
business
in
winter
the
pots
are
generally
set
in
the
ocean
at
depths
of
from
to
fathoms
as
the
greatest
part
of
the
coast
line
is
cut
up
by
numerous
bays
and
rivers
and
these
are
dotted
with
large
and
small
islands
they
form
admirable
breeding
grounds
for
the
lobster
some
of
the
best
locations
are
in

chandler

while
the

is

in

lower
penobscot
and
blue
hill
bays
and
at
monhegan
and
the
matinicus
islands
in
the
ocean
the
sheepscot
river
is
also
a
favorite
resort
for
lobsters
during
the
warm
months
while
in
the
winter
they
retire
to
the
waters
of
the
bay
where
the
fishing
can
be
carried
on
very
easily
at
most
of
the
other
grounds
the
winter
fishing
is
carried
on
in
the
ocean
as
the
lobsters
do
not
usually
remain
in
the
bays
most
of
the
fishing
in
casco
bay
is
carried
on
at
the
eastern
end
among
the
numerous
islands
the
earliest
fishing
of
which
we
have
any
definite
record
was
carried
on
from
the
township
of
harpswell
on
this
bay
this
region
has
held
its
own
remarkably
well
as
in
more
than
twice
as
many
lobsters
were
taken
by
fishermen
from
this
township
than
from
any
other
town
in
the
state
the
upper
portions
of
frenchman
blue
hill
and
penobscot
bays
were
formerly
very
important
grounds
but
are
now
almost
exhausted
these
regions
were
especially
noted
for
large
lobsters
in
august
collins
a
rockland
dealer
had
lobsters
in
his
establishment
which
weighed
from
to
pounds
apiece
about
half
of
these
came
from
castine
in
upper
penobscot
bay
and
the
remainder
from
blue
hill
falls
in
the
upper
blue
hill
bay
the
grounds
in
york
county
at
the
western
end
of
the
state
were
formerly
quite
prolific
but
the
excessive
fishing
of
the
last
thirty
years
has
very
badly
depleted
them
the
fishing
season
in
the
early
days
of
the
fishery
it
was
customary
to
fish
only
during
the
spring
and
fall
when
the
canneries
went
into
operation
they
usually
worked
during
the
spring
early
summer
and
fall
and
as
they
furnished
a
ready
market
for
all
the
lobsters
that
could
be
caught
this
came
to
be
the
principal
season
at
that
time
it
was
not
thought
possible
to
do
any
winter
fishing
owing
to
the
cold
and
stormy
weather
and
the
fact
that
the
fishing
had
to
be
carried
on
generally
in
the
open
sea
in
a
law
was
passed
limiting
the
canning
season
to
the
period
between
april
and
august
this
season
was
frequently
changed
by
subsequent
enactments
but
rarely
covered
a
longer
period
than
that
fixed
in
the
first
law
as
at
certain
places
on
the
coast
the
canneries
were
the
only
market
for
lobsters
the
fishery
would
cease
as
soon
as
the
canneries
stopped
at
other
places
which
were
visited
by
the
smacks
some
of
the
fishermen
would
continue
fishing
after
the
canneries
closed
selling
to
the
smackmen
at
various
times
a
closed
season
was
in
force
but
at
present
there
is
no
limitation
as
to
season
the
canning
industry
in
the
state
practically
ceased
to
exist
in
and
since
then
the
whole
catch
has
had
to
be
marketed
in
a
live
or
boiled
condition
the
smack
fleet
had
been
gradually
increasing
as
the
trade
extended
and
by
the
time
the
canneries
closed
permanently
they
had
extended
their
visits
to
every
point
where
lobsters
could
be
had
in
any
number
at
present
the
majority
of
the
fishermen
usually
haul
out
their
traps
during
july
and
august
and
put
them
in
good
order
for
the
fall
fishing
during
the
excessively
cold
portion
of
the
winter
most
of
the
pots
are
taken
out
but
some
fishing
is
done
during
every
month
of
the
year
the
fishermen
on
monhegan
island
about
miles
southeast
of
pemaquid
point
agree
among
themselves
to
put
no
lobster
pots
in
the
water
until
about
the
of
january
there
is
then
no
restriction
on
fishing
until
about
may
when
all
pots
are
hauled
out
and
no
more
fishing
is
done
until
the
season
begins
again
during
this
season
the
law
in
regard
to
short
lobsters
is
rigidly
enforced
by
the
fishermen
themselves
should
any
outsider
visit
this
island
during
the
close
time
established
by
the
fishermen
and
attempt
to
fish
he
is
quietly
informed
of
the
agreement
and
requested
to
conform
to
it
should
he
persist
in
working
after
this
warning
his
pots
are
apt
to
mysteriously
disappear
as
lobsters
bring
a
much
higher
price
in
winter
than
in
summer
the
monhegan
fishermen
reap
a
rich
reward
as
the
lobsters
are
very
numerous
owing
to
the
months
close
time
on
the
first
day
the
fishermen
hauled
in
one
man
secured
for
which
he
received
cents
apiece
the
smallest
number
secured
by
anyone
was
fishing
appliances
in
most
large
fisheries
for
certain
species
numerous
changes
occur
at
intervals
in
the
apparatus
used
owing
to
changed
conditions
but
in
the
lobster
industry
changes
have
been
few
and
at
an
early
period
the
fishermen
fixed
upon
a
uniform
apparatus
which
has
been
in
use
ever
since
with
but
slight
modifications
and
these
generally
only
temporary
the
earliest
form
of
apparatus
used
to
any
considerable
extent
was
the
hoop
net
this
consisted
generally
of
a
hoop
or
ring
of
about
round
iron
or
a
wooden
hogshead
hoop
from
to
feet
or
more
in
diameter
to
this
hoop
was
attached
a
net
bag
with
a
depth
of
to
inches
as
a
bottom
while
two
wooden
half
hoops
were
bent
above
it
crossing
at
right
angles
in
the
center
about
or
inches
above
the
plane
of
the
hoop
sometimes
these
half
hoops
were
replaced
by
short
cords
the
bait
was
suspended
from
the
point
of
crossing
of
the
two
wooden
hoops
and
the
line
for
raising
and
lowering
the
pots
was
attached
at
the
same
place
as
there
was
no
way
of
closing
the
mouth
of
the
pot
after
a
lobster
had
entered
these
nets
had
to
be
constantly
watched
the
lobster
being
in
the
habit
of
retiring
after
he
had
finished
his
repast
in
using
these
the
fisherman
would
generally
go
out
in
the
evening
and
at
short
intervals
he
would
haul
in
his
nets
and
remove
whatever
lobsters
they
might
contain
the
constant
attention
necessary
in
attending
to
these
hoop
nets
led
the
fishermen
to
devise
an
apparatus
which
would
hold
the
lobsters
after
once
entering
and
would
require
only
occasional
visits
and
lath
pots
were
found
to
fulfill
all
requirements
they
acquire
the
name
from
the
use
of
common
laths
in
their
construction
they
are
usually
about
feet
in
length
with
a
width
of
about
feet
a
height
of
inches
and
in
maine
are
usually
of
semicylindrical
form
the

description
of
this
apparatus
is
from
the

industries
of
the
united
states
sec
v

the
framework
of
the
bottom
consists
of
three
strips
of
wood
either
hemlock
spruce
or
pine
the
first
mentioned
being
the
most
durable
a
little
longer
than
the
width
of
the
pot
about
inches
wide
and
inch
thick
in
the
ends
of
each
of
the
outer
strips
a
hole
is
bored
to
receive
the
ends
of
a
small
branch
of
pliable
wood
which
is
bent
into
a
regular
semicircular
curve
these
hoops
are
made
of
branches
of
spruce
or
hemlock
or
of
hardwood
saplings
such
as
maple
birch
or
ash
generally
retaining
the
bark
three
of
these
similar
frames
straight
below

curved
above
constitute
the
framework
of
each

are
nailed
lengthwise
to
them
with
interspaces
between
about
equal

the
laths
are
sometimes
nailed
on
the

and
sometimes
on

of
the
cross
pieces
the
door
is
formed
by
three
or
four
of

the
door
is
hinged
on
by

small
leather
strips
and
is
fastened
by
a
single
wooden
button
in
the
center
or
by
two
buttons
one
at
each
end
the
openings
into
the
pot
are
two
in
number
one
at
each
end
are
generally
knit
of
coarse
twine
and
have
a
mesh
between
of
an
inch
and
inch
square
they
are
with
one
side
shorter
than
the
other
and
at
the
larger
end
have
the
same
diameter
as
the

the
smaller
and
inner
end
measures
about
inches
in
diameter
and
is
held
open
by
means
of
a
wire
ring

the
funnels
are
fastened
by
the
larger
ends
to
the

frames
of
the

with
the
shorter
side
uppermost
so
that
when
they

pot
instead
of
horizontally
the
inner
ends
are
secured
in
position
by
one
or
two
cords
extending
to
the
center
frame
the
funnels
are
about
or
inches
deep
and
therefore
extend
about
halfway
to

they
taper
rapidly
and
form
a

the

has
not
been

however
the

in
the

from
to
inches
long
this
has
one
large
barb
and
is
set
upright
in
the
middle
of

is
placed
on
this
spearhead
several
large
stones
or
bricks
are
lashed
to
the
bottom
of
the
pot
on
the
inside
in
order
to
furnish
weight
enough
to
hold
the
pot
at
the
bottom
as
it
was
noticed
that
a
lobster
generally
crawled
over
a
pot
before
entering
by
the
end
some
pots
of
a
square
form
and
with
the
opening
at
the
top
were
constructed
but
they
were
not
successful
another
variation
had
a
length
of
feet
and
five
supporting
frames
inside
instead
of
three
as
in
the
old
pot
these
were
set
at
equal
distances
apart
and
had
two
more
funnels
than
the
other
one
funnel
being
attached
to
each
of
the
frames
except
the
center
one
and
all
pointing
inward
in
order
to
reach
the
bait
the
lobster
had
to
pass
through
two
funnels
and
its
chances
of
escape
were
thereby
lessened
this
style
is
rarely
seen
now
still
another
variety
in
vogue
for
a
short
time
had
a
trapdoor
on
which
the
lobster
had
to
climb
in
order
to
reach
the
bait
the
door
then
gave
way
and
precipitated
the
lobster
into
a
secure
inclosure
a
few
pots
are
made
with
a
funnel
of
laths
in
place
of
the

funnels
they
are
the
same
as
the
ordinary
pot
in
every
other
particular

cost
about
to

seasons
the
pots
are
badly
eaten
by
worms
the
shipworm
teredo
or
one
of
the
species
of
small
boring
crustaceans
pots
are
also
frequently
lost
during
stormy
weather
and
the
fishermen
therefore
have
a
reserve
stock
on
hand
in
order
to
replace

are
also
used
as

are
frequently
set

are
quite
thick

lobsters
are
most
numerous
on
a
rocky
bottom
in
the
trawl
method
the
pots
are
usually
set
about
feet
apart
depending
on
the
depth
of
water
so
that
when
one
pot
is
in
the
boat
the
next
will
be
on

have
large

are
set
at
distances
from
the

ranging
from
yards
to

method
of
setting

are
more
scattered
then
and
the
best
results
are
attained
by
shifting
the
position
of
the
pots
slightly
each
time
they
are
fished
this
is
caused
by
the
drift
of
the
boat
while
the
fisherman
is
hauling
in
the
pot
emptying
and
rebaiting
it
and
then
dropping
it
overboard
again
the
winter
fishing
is
generally
carried
on
in
the
open
sea
although
in
a
few
places
like
sheepscot
bay
the
lobsters
in
winter
retire
to
the
deep
waters
of
the
bays
and
can
there
be
caught
the
pots
are
generally
set
in
from
to
fathoms
of
water
at
this
season
certain
fishermen
claim
that
when
pots
are
set
on
a
trawl
placed
across
the
tide
the
catch
is
greater
than
when
the
trawl
is
set
in
the
direction
of
the
current
in
the
former
case
it
is
asserted
the
scent
or
fine
particles
coming
from
the
bait
is
more
widely
diffused
and
more
apt
to
attract
the
lobsters
in
entering
after
first
reconnoitering
around
and
over
the
pot
the
lobster
always
backs
in
primarily
that
he
may
be
prepared
to
meet
any
foe
following
him
also
because
his
large
claws
would
be
apt
to
catch
in
the
net
funnel
should
he
enter
head
first
after
discovering
that
he
is
imprisoned
which
he
does
very
speedily
he
seems
to
lose
all
desire
for
the
bait
and
spends
his
time
roaming
around
the
pot
hunting
for
a
means
of
escape
the
pots
are
generally
hauled
once
a
day
but
sometimes
twice
a
day
in
good
weather
as
the
tide
along
the
maine
coast
is
quite
strong
the
fishermen
usually
haul
their
pots
at
or
about
slack
water
low
tide
generally
being
preferred
when
they
are
worked
once
a
day
the
number
used
by
a
fisherman
varies
greatly
on
different
sections
of
the
coast
according
to
the
investigations
of
this
commission
the
average
number
of
pots
to
the
man
in
certain
years
was
as
follows
pots
in
in
and
in
and
and
in
this
average
however
is
somewhat
misleading
as
quite
a
number
of
persons
along
the
coast
take
up
lobstering
for
only
a
few
months
in
the
year
and
then
return
to
their
regular
occupations
as
these
persons
use
but
few
pots
the
average
per
man
throughout
the
whole
state
is
very
considerably
reduced
the
regular
lobster
fishermen
have
been
steadily
increasing
the
number
of
their
pots
for
several
years
past
they
have
found
this
an
absolute
necessity
in
order
to
catch
as
many
lobsters
now
as
they
caught
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
it
is
not
unusual
now
to
find
one
of
the
regular
fishermen
handling
as
high
as
pots
and
sometimes
even
when
a
few
years
ago
and
pots
was
a
large

this
does
not
take
into
account
his
reserve
stock
of
pots

it
is

even
before
the

fishery
had
been
taken
up
to
any

the
coast

was
visited
by
from
connecticut
and
new
york
most
of
which
had
been
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
live
fish
before
engaging
in
the
carrying
of
lobsters
these
vessels
sometimes
carried
pots
and
caught
their
own
lobsters
but
as
this
method
was
not
very
convenient
the
people
living
along
the
coast
took
up
the
fishery
and
sold
the
lobsters
to
the
smackmen
about
the
canneries
began
to
absorb
a
considerable
part
of
the
catch
and
they
employed
vessels
to
ply
along
the
coast
and
buy
lobsters
as
these
vessels
would
only
be
out
a
few
days
at
a
time
wells
were
not
necessary
and
the
lobsters
were
packed
in
the
hold
in
the
summer
great
numbers
of
them
were
killed
by
the
heat
in
the
hold
after
the
canneries
rapidly
dropped
out
of
the
business
the
last
one
closing
in
in
there
were
but
smacks
of
them
from
new
london
conn
in
there
were
of
which
were
dry
smacks
while
in
there
were
of
which
were
steamers
and
launches
and
sailing
vessels
these
were
all
a
few
sailing
smacks
also
engaged
in
other
fishery
pursuits
during
the
dull
summer
months
in
a
steamer
which
had
no
well
was
used
to
run
lobsters
to
the
cannery
at
castine
the
first
steamer
fitted
with
a
well
to
engage
in
the
business
was
the
owned
by
collins
a
lobster
dealer
of
rockland
who
describes
the
steamer
as
follows
the
steam
and
well
smack
was
built
in
by
robert
palmer
son
of
noank
at
that
time
she
was
a
dry
boat
but
the
following
year
the
palmers
built
a
small
well
in
her
as
an
experiment
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
did
not
prove
very
satisfactory
or
profitable
consequently
they
offered
her
for
sale
and
wrote
to
me
in
relation
to
buying
her
i
went
to
noank
and
looked
her
over
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
by
enlarging
the
well
and
making
other
needed
changes
she
could
be
made
not
only
a
good
boat
to
carry
lobsters
alive
but
also
to
do
it
profitably
consequently
i
bought
her
and
brought
her
to
rockland
had
the
well
enlarged
on
ideas
of
my
own
and
differently
constructed
so
as
to
give
it
better
circulation
of
water
and
also
made
other
needed
improvements
throughout
the
boat
to
adapt
her
especially
for
carrying
lobsters
alive
the
changes
i
made
in
her
proved
so
successful
in
keeping
lobsters
alive
while
it
increased
the
capacity
for
carrying
that
i
have
since
adapted
the
same
principles
on
all
my
boats
the
well
i
had
put
into
the
is
what
is
termed
a
box
well
that
is
without
any
well
deck
the
well
is
built
from
the
sides
of
the
steamer
directly
to
the
hatch
on
the
main
deck
with
bulkheads
forward
and
aft
and
tops
running
directly
to
the
you
will
see
at
once
that
this
well
has
many
advantages
over
the
old
style
with
flat
well
decks
like
those
of
sailing
vessels
it
affords
a
much
larger
carrying
capacity
in
same
space
of
vessel
the
pieces
are
much
higher
up
on
sides
of
vessel
giving
more
room
for
boring
hull
which
affords
much
better
circulation
of
water
in
well
which
is
a
great
advantage
in
keeping
lobsters
alive
while
on
long
trips
every
lobster
can
be
easily
bailed
out
of
the
well
without
grounding
the
vessel
which
is
necessary
with
all
vessels
having
the
well
in
all
steam
and
well
smacks
the
after
part
of
the
ship
is
always
steadiest
consequently
the
well
being
located
aft
as
in
my
smacks
the
lobsters
contained
in
them
are
not
subjected
to
the
hard
pounding
while
running
in
seaway
that
they
are
in
the
wells
where
there
is
no
chance
to
relieve
themselves
other
than
to
be
forced
against
the
well
decks
by
the
upward
force
of
the
water
when
the
vessel
settles
into
the
sea
and
which
results
in
killing
many
of
them
both
of
my
steamers
have
box
wells
aft
and
from
my
experience
compared
with
all
other
steam
and
well
smacks
afloat
i
am
convinced
that
this
well
for
all
practical
purposes
is
the
best
that
has
yet
been
adapted
to
steam
smacks
so
far
as
the
is
concerned
she
has
been
a
perfect
success
in
carrying
her
lobsters
in
all
kinds
of
weather
since
i
put
her
into
commission
october
during
which
time
she
has
had
a
wonderful
career
as
well
as
carrying
millions
of
lobsters
probably
no
boat
of
her
size
has
ever
had
such
an
experience
as
she
has
run
steadily
the
year
around
in
all
kinds
of
weather
during
the
past
eight
previous
to
buying
the
i
had
run
steamers
in
the
lobster
business
but
they
had
no
well
and
being
so
hot
in
their
holds
particularly
in
the
summer
months
the
lobsters
died
so
fast
that
the
business
in
dry
steamers
could
not
be
made
profitable
this
is
what
prompted
me
to
construct
a
well
in
mine
as
i
have
done
the
has
a
length
of
feet
a
breadth
of
feet
and
a
depth
of

a
gross
tonnage
of
tons
and
a
net
tonnage
of

the
steam
smacks
now
used
average
about

are
usually
built
low

have
a
small

an
open
space
between
it

the

in
bad
weather
many
are
apt
to
be
killed
by
the
pitching
and
rolling
to
which
they
are
subjected
these
smacks
make
regular
trips
up
and
down
the
coast
landing
their
cargoes
either
at
rockland
portland
or
at
one
of
the
lobster
pounds
scattered
along
the
coast
they
not
only
stop
at
the
villages
but
also
drop
anchor
off
the
little
camps
of
the
lobstermen
and
should
the
smacks
of
two
rival
dealers
arrive
at
a
place
simultaneously
which
frequently
happens
the
bidding
between
the
captains
for
the
fishermen
catch
gladdens
the
latter
heart
and
greatly
enriches
his
pocketbook
most
of
the
captains
have
regular
places
of
call
where
they
know
the
fishermen
are
holding
their
lobsters
for
them
and
they
follow
a
rude
sort
of
schedule
which
will
not
often
vary
more
than
a
day
or
two
the
lobsters
are
bought
of
the
fishermen
by
count
and
cash
is
paid
for
them
should
the
smack
belong
to
a
dealer
this
practically
ends
the
financial
side
of
the
transaction
so
far
as
the
captain
is
concerned
as
the
crew
are
paid
wages
should
the
smack
belong
to
a
person
other
than
the
dealer
which
is
frequently
the
case
he
either
makes
an
agreement
with
some
dealer
to
run
for
him
exclusively
at
a
certain
price
or
commission
or
else
buys
from
the
fishermen
and
then
sells
at
either
rockland
or
portland
this
method
of
buying
lobsters
is
somewhat
hazardous

also
from

portland
is
very
favorably
situated
in
this
regard
as
casco
bay
is
a
noted
fishing
center
for
lobsters
as
soon
as
a
smack
arrives
it
is
moored
directly
alongside
one
of
the
cars
the
lobsters
are
then
dipped
out
of
the
well
by
means
of
scoop
nets
and
thrown
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
the
doors
of
the
car
are
then
opened
and
men
on
the
vessel
pick
over
the
lobsters
lying
on
the
deck
and
toss
them
two
by
two
into
the
different
compartments
those
dead
and
badly
mutilated
being
thrown
to
one
side
for
the
time
being
all
vigorous
lobsters
above
a
certain
size
are
placed
in
compartments
of
the
car
by
themselves
while
the
weak
and
small
are
put
in
separate
compartments
the
dead
lobsters
and
those
which
have
had
their
shells
broken
or
have
been
so
injured
that
they
are
very
sure
to
die
are
either
thrown
overboard
or
on
the
dump
a
lobster
which
has
lost
one
or
even
both
claws
is
not
thrown
away
as
such
an
injury
would
have
very
little
effect
on
its
health
when
an
order
is
received
for
live
lobsters
those
which
have
been
longest
in
the
cars
are
usually
shipped
flour
barrels
holding
about
pounds
or
sugar
barrels
holding
about
pounds
with
small
holes
bored
in
the
bottoms
for
drainage
are
used
for
the
shipment
formerly
the
lobsters
were
packed
close
together
in
the
barrel
and
a
large
piece
of
ice
was
put
in
at
the
top
but
this
was
found
to
kill
a
number
of
them
the
present
method
is
to
split
off
about
of
a
cake
of
ice
the
long
way
and
place
it
upright
about
half
way
of
the
length
of
the
barrel
the
lobsters
then
being
packed
snugly
on
all
sides
of
the
ice
in
handling
them
the
packer
seizes
the
lobster
by
the
carapace
with
his
right
hand
bends
the
tail
up
under
the
body
with
his
left
hand
and
quickly
deposits
it
in
the
barrel
the
packer
usually
has
his
right
hand
covered
with
a
woolen
mitt
or
wrapped
in
a
long
piece
of
linen
for
protection
from
the
claws
of
the
lobster
when
the
barrel
is
nearly
full
the
lobsters
are
covered
with
a
little
seaweed
or
marine
plants
and
the
rest
of
the
space
is
filled
with
cracked
ice
the
top
is
then
covered
with
a
piece
of
sacking
which
is
secured
under
the
upper
hoop
of
the
barrel
packed
in
this
way
lobsters
have
easily
survived
a
trip
as
far
west
as
louis
owing
to
the
high
prices
realized
in
england
for
live
lobsters
attempts
have
been
made
to
ship
live
american
lobsters
to
that
market
generally
from
canadian
ports
in
john
marston
sons
of
portland
made
a
trial

were
placed
in

large
tank
feet
long
by

wide
and
feet
deep
and
constantly
supplied
with
fresh
seawater
through
six
faucets
by
means
of
a
donkey
engine
a
preventing
any
overflow
the
trip
was
fairly
successful
as
only
died
and
the
balance
brought
from
to
cents
per
pound
the
smacks
and
dealers
buy
lobsters
by
count
as
the
fishermen
generally
have
no
facilities
for
weighing
them
but
the
dealers
always
sell
by
weight
the
mortality
among
the
lobsters
from
the
time
they
are
put
aboard
the
smacks
until
they
are
barreled
for
shipment
is
estimated
at
about
per
cent
boiling
live
lobsters
are
much
preferred
by
the
trade
throughout
the
country
and
only
those
that
can
not
be
marketed
in
such
condition
are
boiled
the
number
boiled
fluctuates
considerably
owing
to
the
condition
of
the

when
the

of
boston
and

shown
that
the

largely
on

is
the
only
state
in

have

the
following
account
of
the
inception
and
early
history
of
the
industry
taken
from
the
fisheries
and
fishery
industries
of
the
united
states
is
very
complete
lobster
canning
was
first
attempted
in
the
united
states
at
eastport
shortly
after
and
was
made
successful
in
the
methods
finally
employed
having
been
borrowed
from
scotland
which
country
is
said
to
have
learned
the
process
from
france
for
the
successful
introduction
of
the
process
into
the
united
states
we
are
indebted
to
charles
mitchell
now
of
charlestown
a
practical
canner
of
scotland
who
had
learned
his
trade
of
john
moir
son
of
aberdeen
the
first
scotch
firm
it
is
claimed
to
put
up
hermetically
sealed
preparations
of
meat
game
and
salmon
their
enterprise
dating
back
to
treat
a
native
of
maine
appears
however
to
have
been
most
active
and
influential
in
starting
the
enterprise
and
in
introducing
canned
goods
into
the
markets
of
the
united
states
mr
treat
was
at
an
early
period
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
smoked
salmon
on
the
penobscot
river
and
in
removed
to
calais
where
he
continued
in
the
same
business
about
he
associated
with
him
a
noble
of
calais
and
a
holliday
a
native
of
scotland
who
had
also
been
employed
in
the
salmon
fisheries
of
the
penobscot
river
under
the
firm
name
of
treat
noble
holliday
this
firm
moved
to
eastport
in
for
the
purpose
of
starting
the
manufacture
of
hermetically
sealed
goods
and
began
experiments
with
lobsters
salmon
and
haddock
their
capital
was
limited
their
appliances
crude
and
many
discouraging
difficulties
were
encountered
the
quality
of
the
cans
furnished
them
was
poor
causing
them
often
to
burst
while
in
the
bath
and
the
proper
methods
of
bathing
and
of
expelling
the
air
from
the
cans
were
not
understood
the
experiments
were
continued
for
two
years
with
varying
success
and
in
secret
no
outsiders
being
allowed
to
enter
their
bathing
room
though
fairly
successful
in
some
of
their
results
they
could
not
always
depend
upon
their
goods
keeping
well
in
they
secured
the
services
of
charles
mitchell
who
was
then
residing
at
halifax
and
who
was
not
only
well
acquainted
with
the
methods
of
bathing
practiced
in
his
own
country
but
was
also
a
practical
tinsmith
he
had
been
employed
in
the
canning
of
hermetically
sealed
goods
in
scotland
for
ten
years
and
came
over
to
halifax
in
where
he
continued
for
two
years
in
the
same
occupation
exporting
his
goods
to
england
after
arrival
at
eastport
no
further
difficulty
was
experienced
in
the
bathing
or
other
preparation
of
the
lobsters
and
a
desirable
grade
of
goods
was
put
up
but
they
found
no
sale
as
canned
preparations
were
comparatively
unknown
in
the
markets
of
the
united
states
mr
treat
visited
each
of
the
larger
cities
with
samples
of
the
goods
and
endeavored
to
establish
agencies
for
them
but
he
was
generally
obliged
to
send
on
consignment
as
few
firms
were
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
of
buying
on
their
own
account
a
patent
was
also
applied
for
but
the
claim
was
not
pressed
and
the
patent
was
never
received
the
success
at
eastport
led
to
a
rapid
extension
of
the
business
in
other
parts
of
the
state
the
second
cannery
was
located
at
harpswell
about
the
year
a
cannery
was
started
at
carver
harbor
fox
islands
in
and
another
at
southwest
harbor
in
in
a
cannery
was
started
at
north
haven
and
at
gouldsboro
two
were
started
in
and
respectively
from
this
time
the
number
increased
rapidly
for
several
years
after
the
number
operated
fluctuated
considerably
depending
on
the
abundance
of
lobsters
some
canneries
had
to
suspend
operations
at
an
early
stage
owing
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
grounds
in
their
vicinity
at
most
canneries
lobsters
formed
only
a
part
of
the
pack
sardines
clams
fish
and
various
vegetables
and
fruits
being
packed
in
their
season
most
of
the
canneries
were
built
and
operated
by
boston
and
portland
firms
at
first
the
lobsters
used
for
canning
ranged
in
weight
from
to
pounds
gradually
the
average
weight
was
reduced
until
at
last
it
reached
as
low
as
pound
or
even
less
this
was
caused
principally
by
the
high
prices
paid
for
large
lobsters
for
the
fresh
trade
with
which
the
canneries
could
not
compete
as
the
supply
of
lobsters
on
the
maine
coast
began
to
decrease
shortly
before
while
the
demand
for
canned
lobsters
increased
at
an
enormous
rate
the
dealers
began
to
establish
canneries
on
the
coasts
of
the
british
provinces
as
the
decline
in
the
supply
was
attributed
to
the
canneries
a
sentiment
against
them
was
gradually
formed
and
laws
were
enacted
regulating
the
time
in
which
they
could
operate
and
the
size
of
the
lobsters
they
could
put
up
prior
to
they
were
permitted
to
pack
lobsters
at
any
season
of
the
year
but
they
usually
operated
only
between
april
and
august
and
again
between
the
or
middle
of
september
and
the
of
december
the
length
of
the
season
depending
very
largely
upon
the
weather
and
the
abundance
of
lobsters
in
it
was
enacted
that
no
canning
of
lobsters
should
be
allowed
from
august
to
april
following
in
it
was
made
illegal
to
can
lobsters
less
than
inches
in
length
in
the
canning
season
was
fixed
from
april
to
july
in
the
season
was
fixed
from
may
to
july
and
the
minimum
length
of
lobsters
to
be
canned
placed
at
inches
in
this
act
was
so
amended
as
to
make
the
season
from
april
to
june
after
the
number
of
canneries
gradually
declined
until

the

one
suspended
the
canning
of
lobsters
owing
to
the
passage
of
a
law
fixing

this
law
went
into
effect
july
as
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
high
price
demanded
for
this

they
were

there
are
no
accurate

showing
the
catch
of

in
maine
previous
to
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
make
comparisons
and
one
is
compelled
to
depend
largely
upon
the
memory
of
the
fishermen
and
the
statements
of
the
canners
and
dealers
which
the
lapse
of
time
makes
rather
unreliable
the
numerous
petitions
sent
to
the
legislature
asking
for
restrictive
laws
while
possibly
exaggerated
at
times
indicate
that
there
were
fears
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
fishery
for
some
years
back
it
is
positively
known
however
that
certain
grounds
have
been
almost
or
totally
exhausted
through
overfishing
for
a
number
of
years
while
on
other
grounds
the
supply
of
lobsters
has
seriously
decreased
there
was
a
time
when
no
lobster
under
pounds
in
weight
was
saved
by
the
fishermen
in
later
years
before
there
was
a
restriction
fixing
the
minimum
size
of
lobsters
that
could
be
canned
the
canneries
frequently
used
lobsters
the
fixing
of
the
minimum
length
of
the
lobsters
caught
at
inches
and
the
consequent
closing
up
of
the
canneries
has
been
of
incalculable
benefit
to
the
fishermen
as
the
young
lobsters
now
have
an
opportunity
to
reach
maturity

the
rapid
increase
in
the
catch
of
this
crustacean
during
the
past
ten
years
has
drawn
upon
it
the
most
earnest
attention
of
all
interested
in
the
preservation
of
this
valuable
fishery
if
the
berried
or
female
lobster
bearing
eggs
and
the
young
and
immature
were
let
alone
by
the
fishermen
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
a
resort
to
artificial
lobster
culture
maine
has
a
most
stringent
law
forbidding
the
taking
and
selling
of
berried
lobsters
and
of
any
lobster
under
inches
in
length
but
this
law
is
evaded
by
numerous
fishermen
whenever
possible
an
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
short
lobsters
are
marketed
in
the
state
may
be
gathered
from
the
statement
of
nickerson
commissioner
of
sea
and
shore
fisheries
for
the
state
that
in
over
short
lobsters
were
seized
and
liberated
by
the
state
wardens
as
these
wardens
only
discover
a
small
proportion
of
the
short
lobsters
handled
by
the
fishermen
and
dealers
it
is
easy
to
see
what
a
terrible
drain
this
is
on
the
future
hope
of
the
fishery
the
young
and
immature
large
numbers
of
berried
lobsters
are
also
captured
the
eggs
brushed
off
and
the
lobsters
sold
as
ordinary
female
lobsters
the
report
of
the
fish
commission
for
on
pages
and
contains
the
following
account
of
the
artificial
propagation
of
lobsters
prior
to
experiments
had
been
conducted
at
various
points
looking
to
the
artificial
propagation
of
the
lobster
the
only
practical
attempts
of
this
nature
previous
to
those
made
by
the
fish
commission
were
by
means
of
parking
that
is
holding
in
large
naturally
inclosed
basins
lobsters
that
had
been
injured
ones
and
those
below
marketable
size
occasionally
females
with
spawn
were
placed
in
the
same
inclosures
one
of
these
parks
was
established
in
massachusetts
in
but
was
afterwards
abandoned
another
was
established
on
the
coast
of
maine
about
it
was
soon
demonstrated
however
that
the
results
from
inclosures
of
this
character
so
far
as
the
rearing
of
the
lobsters
from
the
young
were
concerned
would
not
be
sufficient
to
materially
affect
the
general
supply
the
completion
of
the
new
marine
laboratory
and
hatchery
at
woods
hole
in
with
its
complete
system
of
circulation
permitted
the
commencement
of
experiments
in
artificial
hatching
on
a
large
scale
which
had
not
been
practicable
theretofore
although
small
quantities
of
lobster
eggs
as
well
as
those
of
other
crustaceans
had
been
successfully
hatched
in
the
experiments
had
progressed
so
successfully
that
several
million
eggs
were
collected
and
hatched
at
woods
hole
the
fry
being
deposited
in
vineyard
sound
and
adjacent
waters
from
to
inclusive
the
number
of
eggs
collected
was
during
the
above
years
the
average
production
of
fry
was
about
per
cent
by
the
use
of
more
improved
apparatus
the
average
was
brought
up
to
per
cent
in
when
the
collections
amounted
to
eggs
of
which
were
hatched
as
the
commissioner
of
sea
and
shore
fisheries
of
maine
objected
to
the
taking
of
female
lobsters
in
that
state
and
the
planting
of
part
at
least
of
the
resulting
fry
in
other
waters
an
arrangement
was
made
in
by
which
all
female
lobsters
and
the
fry
hatched
out
from
the
eggs
secured
from
these
would
be
returned
to
the
state
waters
under
this
arrangement
berried
lobsters
were
bought
from
the
maine
fishermen
by
the
fish
commission
from
these
eggs
were
taken
and
fry
were
hatched
of
these
were
deposited
in
maine
waters
at
various
points
in
fry
were
planted
in
maine
waters
by
the
commission
in
order
that
the
female
lobsters
may
be
secured
the
authorities
of
maine
permit
the
fishermen
to
catch
and
sell
berried
lobsters
to
the
commission
the
collection
of
eggs
in
maine
is
usually
made
by
the
commission
during
the
months
of
april
may
june
and
to
about
the
middle
of
july
depending
upon
the
supply
to
be
had
during
the
season
of
a
small
steam
smack
was
chartered
for
collecting
the
lobsters
starting
from
gloucester
where
the
hatching
of
maine
lobster
eggs
is
now
carried
on
and
running
to
eastport
returning
over
the
same
route
the
fish
commission
schooner
was
also
used
in
this
work
the
lobsters
are
purchased
from
fishermen
who
receive
the
market
price
for
ordinary
lobsters
and
as
they
are
not
allowed
to
sell
these
lobsters
legally
for
consumption
the
sale
to
the
commission
materially
increases
their
financial
returns
in
a
radical
advance
along
the
line
of
artificial
propagation
was
made
so
far
as
the
legislature
was
concerned
when
the
act
incorporating
the
samoset
island
association
of
boothbay
was
passed
section
of
the
charter
reads
as
follows
in
order
to
secure
a
sufficient
and
regular
supply
of
lobsters
for
domestic
consumption
on
any
land
or
islands
under
the
control
of
said
corporation
it
may
increase
the
number
of
lobsters
within
said
limits
by
artificial
propagation
or
other
appropriate
acts
and
methods
under
the
direction
of
the
fishery
commission
and
shall
not
be
interfered
with
by
other
parties
but
be
protected
therein
as
said

commission
may
determine
and
shall
have
the
right
by
its

and
lands
owned
or
leased
by

during
each

mr

a
failure

was
so
filthy
that
nearly
all
the
spawn
was
killed
large

peculiar

since
the
inception
of
the

stories
of
the
capture
of
lobsters
weighing
and
even
pounds
have
been
common
but
have
rarely
been
well
authenticated
especially
is
this
the
case
in
the
early
years
of
the
fishery
it
is
probable
that
in
the
transmission
of
the
stories
from
person
to
person
the
lobsters
gained
rather
than
lost
in
size
among
the
most
authentic
cases
in
maine
are
the
following
on
may
a
male
lobster
weighing
slightly
over
pounds
was
taken
in
penobscot
bay
southeast
of

after
getting
his

get
either
in
