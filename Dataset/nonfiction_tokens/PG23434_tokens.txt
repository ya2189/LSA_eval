introduction
in
the
preparation
of
a
book
of
this
nature
to
be
used
in
the
grade
schools
we
realize
that
the
one
fundamental
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
economic
importance
of
the
insect
be
it
good
or
bad
the
child
wants
to
know
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
and
how
he
can
make
use
of
the
good
and
how
he
can
get
rid
of
the
bad
and
yet
there
is
something
more
associated
with
the
life
work
and
development
of
each
tiny
insect
there
is
a
story
a
story
of
growth
not
unlike
that
of
the
developing
child
a
story
of
courage
strife
and
ultimate
success
or
failure
which
is
as
interesting
and
of
greater
value
to
the
child
than
many
of
the
stories
of
adventure
and
of
historical
facts
snatches
of
these
stories
will
appear
in
the
following
chapters
along
with
the
studies
on
insects
and
their
economic
importance
in
the
development
of
our
grade
school
system
especially
in
the
rural
districts
there
is
a
growing
demand
for
some
practical
work
along
with
the
regular
cultural
studies
to
the
child
in
the
rural
schools
practical
knowledge
naturally
tends
toward
agriculture
many
of
these
boys
and
girls
do
not
have
a
chance
to
pursue
studies
beyond
the
grades
and
it
therefore
becomes
necessary
to
introduce
some
elementary
agriculture
into
the
grades
to
supply
the
natural
craving
of
this
vast
assemblage
of
children
in
the
rural
schools
of
our
land
in
the
search
for
a
study
which
will
give
unlimited
scope
for
independent
thought
and
observation
and
which
will
lead
the
child
to
understand
better
the
forces
of
nature
that
affect
agriculture
nothing
is
so
readily
available
and
attractive
to
the
child
as
nature
study
an
elementary
study
of
the
natural
sciences
in
fact
agriculture
is
primarily
a
course
in
nature
study
where
we
study
how
plants
and
animals
struggle
for
existence
there
is
a
period
in
the
life
of
every
child
when
he
is
especially
susceptible
to
the
call
of
the
fields
when
he
roams
through
woods
or
by
shady
brooks
gathering
flowers
fishing
for
and
cleaning
out
nests
it
is
often
compared
with
the
life
of
the
savage
and
is
merely
the
outward
expression
of
an
inward
craving
for
a
closer
relation
with
nature
and
her
creatures
if
one
can
reach
a
child
while
at
that
age
he
has
a
ready
listener
and
an
apt
pupil
that
is
the
time
to
guide
and
instruct
the
child
along
the
line
of
nature
study
the
most
important
questions
confronting
the
average
teacher
in
the
grade
schools
are
what
material
shall
i
use
and
how
shall
i
proceed
to
direct
the
child
along
this
line
first
of
all
use
that
material
which
is
most
readily
available
which
is
most
familiar
to
the
child
and
which
will
attract
and
hold
his
attention
there
is
nothing
so
readily
available
and
so
generally
interesting
to
both
boys
and
girls
as
are
the
thousands
of
fluttering
buzzing
hopping
and
creeping
forms
of
insects
they
are
present
everywhere
in
all
seasons
and
are
known
to
every
child
of
the
city
or
farm
they
are
easily
observed
in
the
field
and
can
be
kept
in
confinement
for
study
many
of
them
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
man
a
study
of
them
becomes
of
special
value
in
pursuing
a
study
of
nature
and
her
creatures
one
should
go
into
the
woods
and
fields
as
much
as
possible
and
study
them
where
they
are
found
in
this
way
one
can
determine
how
they
live
together
what
they
feed
on
and
the
various
other
questions
which
the
inquisitive
mind
of
a
healthy
child
will
ask
when
field
work
is
not
possible
gather
the
insects
and
keep
them
alive
in
jars
where
they
can
be
fed
and
observed
some
forms
can
not
be
kept
in
confinement
and
in
such
cases
samples
should
be
killed
and
pinned
thereby
forming
a
collection
for
study
most
of
the
forms
which
are
included
in
the
following
chapters
can
be
kept
in
confinement
in
glass
jars
or
studies
out
doors
the
studies
have
been
made
so
general
that
in
case
the
particular
form
mentioned
is
not
available
any
closely
related
form
can
be
used
each
child
should
make
a
small
collection
of
living
and
pinned
insects
for
study
and
should
be
encouraged
to
observe
insects
and
their
work
in
the
field
the
collections
and
many
of
the
observations
could
be
made
to
good
advantage
during
the
summer
vacation
when
the
insects
are
most
abundant
and
active
pupils
should
not
be
encouraged
merely
to
make
observations
but
they
should
be
required
to
record
them
as
well
brief
descriptions
of
the
appearance
and
development
of
insects
the
injury
they
do
and
remedies
for
the
same
will
help
fix
in
mind
facts
which
otherwise
might
soon
be
forgotten
drawings
whenever
possible
should
also
be
required
the
pupil
who
can
record
observations
accurately
with
drawings
will
not
soon
forget
them
the
teacher
should
therefore
require
each
pupil
to
provide
himself
with
a
for
keeping
brief
but
accurate
notes
and
careful
drawings
the
drawings
should
be
made
with
a
hard
lead
pencil
on
paper
the
size
of
the
and
the
pupils
should
be
encouraged
to
be
neat
and
accurate
the
author
wishes
to
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
his
deep
appreciation
for
the
many
helpful
suggestions
and
other
assistance
which
emberson
superintendent

has
given
it
was
his
devotion
to
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
grade
schools
and
his
keen
appreciation
of
their
needs
that
lead
him
first
to
suggest
to
the
author
the
importance
of
preparing
this
little
book
for
their
use

is
a
difference
between
a

yet
your

was
a
shakespeare
in
undertaking
a
study
of
insects
it
is
well
first
of
all
to
know
something
about
what
they
are
their
general
nature
appearance
habits
and
development
the
insects
comprise
the
largest
group
of
animals
on
the
globe
there
are
about
four
times
as
many
different
kinds
of
insects
as
all
other
kinds
of
animals
combined
insects
vary
greatly
in
size
some
are
as
large
as
small
birds
while
others
are
so
small
that
a
thousand
placed
in
one
pile
would
not
equal
the
size
of
a
pea
insects
are
commonly
spoken
of
as
bugs
this
term
however
is
properly
used
only
when
referring
to
the
one
order
of
insects
which
includes
the
sap
and
insects
such
as
the
chinch
bug
squash
bug
and
the
like
then
too
there
are
many
bugs
which
are
not
insects
at
all
spiders
crawfishes
and
even
are
often
spoken
of
as
bugs

insects
are
variously
formed
but
as
a
rule
the
mature
ones
have
three
and
only
three
pairs
of
legs
one
pair
of
feelers
one
pair
of
large
eyes
and
one
or
two
pairs
of
wings
the
body
is
divided
into
a
head
thorax
and
abdomen
the
head
bears
the
eyes
feelers
and
mouth
the
thorax
bears
the
legs
and
wings
and
the
abdomen
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
segments
the
presence
of
wings
at
once
decides
whether
or
not
it
is
an
insect
for
aside
from
bats
and
birds
insects
alone
have
true
wings
these
are
the
distinguishing
characters
of
the
full
grown
insect
but
like
birds
they
hatch
from
eggs
and
while
young
do
not
always
look
like
their
parents
when
young
they
may
take
on
various
shapes
as
caterpillars
borers
maggots
grubs
hoppers
and
the
like
young
insects
are
often
difficult
to
distinguish
from
true
worms
centipedes
snails
and
such
forms
but
after
one
has
collected
and
reared
some
of
the
young
and
watched
them
pass
through
the
different
stages
and
emerge
with
wings

are
soft

caterpillars

maggots
while
the
old
ones
usually
have
a
hard
body
wall
similar
to
the
beetles
and
wasps
the
wings
are
usually
thin
and
transparent
though
in
some
cases
they
are
leathery
or
hard
as
in
case
of
beetles
or
covered
with

the
feelers
or
antennae
are
usually
threadlike
clubbed

the

many
great
small

of
an
insect

an
entirely
different
plan
from
our
own
chewing
insects
have
an
upper

and
between
these
there
are
two
pairs
of
grinding
jaws
these
jaws
are
hinged
at

when

they
come
together
from
either
side
so
as
to
meet
in

they
therefore
work
sidewise
rather
than
up

this
way
the
internal
organs
of
the
insect
are
simply
bathed
in

the
system
of
respiration
is
most
complicated
the
air
is
taken
in
through
pores
usually
along
the
side
of
the
body
and
is
then
carried
through
fine
tracheal
tubes
to
all
parts

body
you
can
not
drown
an
insect
by
putting
its
head

active
larva

born
alive
whether
the
egg
hatches
before
or
after

is
deposited
the
young
insect
continues
to
develop
in
one
of
three
ways
it
may
resemble
the
parent
and
simply
grow
as
does
a
kitten
or
it
may
look
somewhat
like
its
parent
though
smaller
and
without
wings
as
the
young
grasshopper
or
it
may
bear
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
parent
as
the
caterpillar
which
feeds
and
grows
and
finally
spins
a
cocoon
in
which
it
passes
to
the
resting
chrysalis
stage
and
later
emerges
with
wings
the
development
of
insects

naturally
grouped
into
such
divisions
and
subdivisions
among
the
insects
we
at
once
detect
seven
large
sharply
defined
divisions
or
orders
and
ten
or
more
smaller
ones
of
these
we
have
first
the
true
flies
second
the
butterflies
and
moths
third
the
beetles
fourth
the
stinging
wasps
and
bees
fifth
the
variously
formed
sucking
insects
or
true
bugs
as
chinch
bugs
and
sixth
the
snake
doctors
or
and
seventh
the
hopping
forms
the
grasshoppers
besides
these
we
have
the
various
smaller
orders
of
insects
fleas
etc
the
seven
groups
mentioned
above
include
the
majority
of
our
common
forms
and
in
the
studies
to
follow
we
will
include
only
representatives
from
these
orders

the
habits
of
insects
are
as
varied
as
their
forms
and
adaptations
some
live
in
the
water
all
their
life
others
spend
a
part
of
their
life
under
water
others
live
the
life
of
the
open
air
others
enjoy
feeding
upon
and
living
in
the
foulest
of
filth
others
associate
themselves
with
certain
definite
crops
or
animals
thereby
doing
untold
injury
while
others
produce
food
and
other
materials
which
are
to
be

the
most
striking
habits
and
developments
among
insects
is
found
in
the
more
highly
advanced
families
of
bees
and
ants
where
definite
insect
societies
are
formed
resembling
in
many
respects
human
societies
and
human
activities
among
these
villages
are
established
homes
built
battles
fought

kept
by
shepherds
and
even

cultivated
in
these
groups
we
have
the
nearest
approach
to
human
intelligence
role
in
some
insects
may
be
very
destructive
to
crops
others
are
beneficial
while
the
majority
of
insects
are
of
no
importance
to
man
or
agriculture
the
various
forms
of
pests
such
as
the
chinch
bug
potato
beetles
and
others
do
an
enormous
amount
of
damage
each
year
they
destroy
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
crops
annually
in
the
united
states
alone
they
devour
enough
to
pay
for
the
entire
cost
of
running
the
school
system
of
our
country
and
nearly
enough
to
meet
all
the
expenses
of
our
government
in
view
of
these
facts
it
is
the
duty
of
each
and
every
farmer
young
or
old
to
acquaint
himself
with
these
destructive
pests
and
prepare
himself
for
combating
them
with
a
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
controlling
these
pests
much
of
this
enormous
loss
can
be
prevented
while
some
insects
are
extremely
injurious
others
are
very
helpful
the
products
of
the
honey
bee
in
the
united
states
alone
amount
to
several
million
dollars
a
year
to
say
nothing
of
its
value
to
the
farmer
in
pollinating
fruits
the
annual
output
of
silk
all
of
which
is
spun
by
the
silkworm
is
worth
millions
of
dollars
many
other
forms
are
of
value
to
man
by
producing
material
of
commercial
value
such
as
lac
shellack
dyes
medicines
etc
of
all
the
beneficial
insects
those
which
are
of
greatest
value
to
man
are
the
parasites
and
similar
forms
which
help
to
keep
in
check
many
of
the
severest
pests
of
the
farm
insects
are
not
all
bad
fellows
by
any
means
one
must
acquaint
himself
with
those
which
are
good
and
those
which
are
bad
before
he
can
hope
to
deal
with
them
intelligently
with
childlike
credulous
affection
we
behold
those
tender
wings
expand
emblems
of
our
own
great
resurrection

chapter
ii
collecting
insects
he
who
searches
nature
secrets
scruple
to
stick
a
pin
into
an
insect
oehlenschlaeger
in
the
life
of
every
normal
human
there
comes
a
time
when
he
wishes
to
make
a
collection
of
some
kind
it
may
be
a
collection
of
coins
postage
stamps
shells
relics
birds
eggs
pressed
flowers
or
insects
if
the
child
grows
up
in
the
country
the
result
of
this
craving
is
usually
three
or
four
cigar
boxes
of
insects
or
an
almanac
or
geography
stuffed
with
the
most
attractive
wild
flowers
of
the
field
a
collection
of
this
sort
may
be
small
and
poorly
kept
and
yet
it
is
worth
while
in
later
life
one
will
search
in
his
mother
closet
or
attic
for
the
old
cigar
boxes
which
contain
the
remains
of
youthful
efforts
usually
a
mass
of
gaudy
wings
fragments
of
insect
legs
and
bodies
and
a
few
rusty
pins
this
desire
to
make
a
collection
is
natural
and
should
be
encouraged
in
the
child
it
tends
to
make
him
observe
closely
and
creates
an
interest
in
things
about
him
and
if
properly
directed
it
will
add
a
store
of
information
which
can
be
gotten
in
no
other
way
for
many
boys
and
girls
of
the
rural
schools
will
have
little
time
or
inclination
to
provide
themselves
with
apparatus
for
collecting
insects
an
old
straw
hat
or
a
limb
will
serve
their
purpose
from
their
point
of
view
what
difference
does
it
make
if
they
tear
off
most
of
the
legs
and
break
the
wings
they
succeed
in
securing
the
bug
and
when
pinned
in
the
box
it
will
mean
just
about
as
much
to
them
as
the
most
perfect
specimen
ever
prepared
illustration
a
convenient
net
for
catching
insects
note
the
handle
heavy
twisted
wire
and
mosquito
net
bag
this
method
of
catching
insects
will
prove
effective
where
nothing
better
is
available
but
any
child
can
easily
make
a
small
insect
net
by
attaching
a
loop
of
fairly
stiff
wire
to
a
broom
handle
or
other
stick
and
sewing
a
bag
of
mosquito
netting
or
other
thin
cloth
to
the
wire
by
means
of
such
a
net
one
can
catch
insects
more
easily
and
at
the
same
time
there
is
less
danger
of
tearing
such
insects
as
butterflies
care
must
be
taken
in
handling
the
stinging
insects

the
country
boy
and
girl
will
have
little
trouble
getting
hold
of
insects
but
they
are
often
puzzled
when
it
comes
to
killing
them
it
seems
cruel
to
pin
up
an
insect
alive
and
have
it
squirm
for
a
day
or
two
and
some
means
of
killing
them
should
be
devised
most
of
the
soft
insects
such
as
flies
butterflies
can
be
killed
by
pressing
their
body
in
the
region
of
the
wings
between
one
thumb
and
forefinger
such
forms
as
beetles
and
wasps
can
be
quickly
killed
by
dropping
them
into
coal
oil
or
a
strong
soap
suds
any
method
which
can
be
devised
for
quickly
killing
the
insect
and
which
will
not
seriously
mutilate
it
can
be
used
a
convenient
killing
bottle
can
be
made
by
sealing
a
few
small
lumps
of
the
deadly
poison
potassium
or
sodium
cyanide
in
the
bottom
of
a
strong
bottle
with
plaster
of
paris
or
a
few
drops
of
chloroform
or
ether
on
a
wad
of
cotton
in
a
similar
bottle
will
also
serve
as
a
convenient

jar
and

a
illustration
method
of
pinning
different
kinds
of
insects
after
the
insects
have
been
caught
and
killed
they
should
then
be
prepared
for
the
permanent
collection
most
insects
such
as
wasps
beetles
flies
and
grasshoppers
should
simply
have
a
pin
thrust
through
their
bodies
until
they
are
the
way
up
on
the
pin
and
then
put
them
away
in
a
box
such
forms
as
butterflies
and
moths
make
a
much
better
collection
if
the
wings
are
spread
so
as
to
bring
out
their
gaudy
markings
in
order
to
spread
butterflies
wings
one
needs
a
spreading
board
which
can
be
made
in
ten
minutes
by
taking
a
pine
board
two
feet
long
and
six
inches
wide
and
on
this
nail
two
strips
an
inch
thick
so
that
there
is
a
crack
between
them
the
crack
should
be
half
an
inch
wide
at
one
end
and
a
quarter
of
an
inch
wide
at
the
other
end
and
in
the
bottom
of
it
press
strips
of
cornstalk
pith
so
as
to
have
something
soft
in
which
to
stick
the
pins
after
a
pin
has
been
stuck
through
the
body
of
a
dead
butterfly
between
the
wings
it
is
then
pinned
in
the
crack
so
that
the
back
of
the
butterfly
is
on
a
level
with
the
strips
then
the
wings
are
drawn
forward
until
they
stand
straight
out
from
the
body
when
they
are
pinned
down
by
means
of
strips
of
paper
and
left
to
dry
a
few
days
until
they
become
perfectly
rigid
in
this
way
a
most
beautiful
collection
can
be
made
very
easily
but
where
time
and
materials
are
not
available
simply
pin
them
up
like
other
insects
leaving
the
wings
to
hang
as
they
will
after
the
specimens
are
pinned
they
should
be
put
away
in
cigar
boxes
in
the
bottom
of
which
is
pinned
or
pasted
a
layer
of
cork
or
corrugated
paper
similar
to
that
which
comes
between
glass
fruit
cans
these
make
ideal
cases
for
keeping
small
collections
as
the
odor
of
tobacco
helps
keep
pests
from
getting
in
to
destroy

these

had
was
making

boys
of
all

pinned
up
on

the
grasshopper

of
the
most
ancient
plagues
of

they
have
destroyed

they
were
so
destructive
as
to
cause
severe

and
various
other
references
to
their
destructive
work
are
to
be

in
the
early
writings
since
those
early
days
just
think
of
the
crops
that
have
disappeared
between
the
greedy
jaws
of
grasshoppers
in
our
own
country
it
has
not
been
many
years
since
the
sun
was
darkened
for
days
by
clouds
of
grasshoppers
as
they
settled
down
from
the
rocky
mountains
upon
the
growing
crops
in
the
neighboring
states
one
day
a

in

with

we
lost
a

we
lost
many
more

in
the

of
which
this

played
a
most
important
part
the

is
dangerous
on

of
its
filthy
habits
it
breeds
in
filth
feeds
on
filth
in
open
closets
on
the
streets

in
back
alleys
and
then
comes
into
the

wipes
this
filth
on

even
in

here
we
have
a
pest
which
endangers
our
very
lives
and
the
lives
of
those
dear
to
us
if
the

confined
itself
to

we
could
overlook
it

it
would
help
to
hasten
the
removal
of
filth
on
the
other
hand
if
it
avoided
filth
and
remained
in
our
home
we
could
not
overlook
it
but
we
could
feel
safe
that
it
was
not
apt
to
do
us
a
great

of
harm

like
the

one

it
is
here

the

it

some

to

of

go
to
the

by

chapter
v
the
mosquito
here
we
have
another
small
insect
which
like
the
house
fly
is
extremely
dangerous
due
to
its
ability
to
carry
the
germs
of
disease
there
are
hundreds
of
species
of
mosquitoes
some
small
some
large
the
majority
of
these
are
unable
to
carry
disease
so
far
as
we
know
at
present
but
they
should
be
avoided
as
dangerous
the
missouri
forms
which
carry
disease
are
the
malarial
fever
mosquitoes
and
they
are
entirely
responsible
for
the
transmission
of
this
sapping
and
often
fatal
disease
in
the
warm
countries
these
are
more
abundant
and
the
fever
is
more
fatal
in
the
south
there
is
still
another
mosquito
the
yellow
fever
mosquito
this
form
is
most
dangerous
of
all
the
mosquito
first
bites
a
patient
suffering
with
malaria
and
in
this
way
it
takes
in
germs
along
with
the
blood
which
it
sucks
from
the
patient
after
these
germs
pass
through
stages
of
development
in
the
body
of
the
mosquito
they
are
ready
to
be
injected
back
into
a
healthy
person
where
in
due
time
they
cause
the
disease
the
germs
feed
inside
the
red
blood
corpuscles
and
at
regular
intervals
they
destroy
a
large
number
of
these
causing
a
chill
which
is
followed
by
fever
and
a
new
supply
of
corpuscles
is
produced
this
alternation
of
chill
and
fever
may
continue
all
summer
if
medicine
is
not
taken
to
destroy
the

quinine
will
kill
the
germs
if
it
is
taken

that
plenty
of
it
is
in

often
bite

the
trunk

they

the

through

little
can
be
done

therefore
remedies
must
be
applied
to

all

in

before

appear
since
most
of

the
firefly
this
insect
is
of
little
economic
importance
to
us
at
present
but
its
peculiar
habit
of
producing
light
makes
it
a
very
striking
form
and
one
which
deserves
study
the
firefly
is
a
beetle
and
begins
to
make
its
appearance
the
latter
part
of
june
when
the
darkest
nights
may
be
one
solid
glow
of
fire
they
live
largely
in
damp
places
and
bottoms
at
night
are
specked
with
their
tiny
flashes
of
light
the
larval
or
grub
stage
is
passed
on
the
ground
beneath
grass
weeds
and
rubbish
where
they
often
prey
upon
other
insects
in
some
cases
the
grubs
may
be
able
to
produce
light
though
as
a
rule
the

they

how

collect
a

the
fireflies
and
put
them
in
a

and
see
if
the
light
is
strong
enough
to
enable
you
to
read
the
firefly
has
proven
to
us
that
our
methods
of
producing
light
are
extremely
wasteful
since
much
of
the
energy
is
lost
in
heat
and
it
is
possible
that
through
the
lesson
of
the
firefly
we
may
some
day
be
able
to
produce
better
light
at
less
expense

feed
on
potatoes
and
often
completely
strip
them
of
their
leaves
since
they
feed
on

can
be
very
quickly
destroyed

the
plants
with
a
poison
such
as

the
squash
bug
this
common
blackish
or
bug
is
usually
called
the
squash
it
has
a
very
disagreeable
odor
which
gives
it
this
name
when
disturbed
it
throws
off
from
scent
glands
a
small
quantity
of
an
oily
substance
which
produces
this
odor
this
is
a
protection
to
it
for
few
birds
or
animals
care
to
feed
on
it
most
species
of
sap
or
blood
sucking
true
bugs
have
a
similar
protecting
odor
the
squash
bug
feeds
largely
on
squash
and
pumpkins
it
has
a
slender
beak
with
mouth
parts
which
are
stuck
into
the
plant
for
extracting
the
sap
it
feeds
only
on
plant
sap
when
it
can
not
get
squash
or
pumpkins
it
will
feed
on
watermelons
muskmelons
and
related
crops
it
is
very
destructive
to
these
crops
it
not
only
extracts
sap
thus
weakening
the
plant
but
it
also
seems
to
poison
the
plant
while
feeding
in
this
way
its
bite
injures
the
plant
something
like
the
effects
of
the
bite
on
our
flesh
it
feeds
first
on
the
leaves
and
vines
often
killing
them
in
a
few
days
later
it
may
cluster
and
feed
on
the
unripe
squashes
or
pumpkins
in
such
numbers
as
to
completely
cover
them
every
country
boy
or
girl
has
seen
these
stinking
bugs
on
pumpkins

the

bug
lives
thru
the
winter
as
the
matured
winged
insect
it
flies
from
its
food
plant
to
winter
quarters
late
in
the
fall
for
winter
protection
it
may
enter
buildings
hide
under
shingles
on
roofs
crawl
into
piles
of
lumber
under
bark
of
dead
trees
or
stumps
or
hide
under
any
similar
protection
when
its
chosen
food
crops
begin
to
come
up
in
the
spring
it
leaves
its
winter
home
and
flies
in
search
of
food
after
feeding
for
a
time
the
female
lays
patches
of
oval
flattened
eggs
set
on
edge
when
first
deposited
the
eggs
have
a
pale
color
but
in
a
short
time
the
golden
color
appears
in
some
cases
only
three
or
four
eggs
may
be
found
in
one
patch
while
again
there
may
be
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
they
are
so
brightly
colored
that
they
can
easily
be
seen
and
most
boys
and
girls
have
seen
them
on
the
leaves

pumpkins
illustration
cluster
of
eggs
of
squash
showing
two
recently
hatched
nymphs
in
a
few
days
after
they
are
laid
they
hatch
and
out
of
each
crawls
a
small
blackish
or
greenish
young
bug
called
the
nymph
these
little
fellows
usually
stay
in
a
crowd
hiding
on
the
under
side
of
a
leaf
after
feeding
for
a
time
their
leaf
begins
to
turn
yellow
and
soon
dies
then
they
move
to
a
new
leaf
as
they
feed
they
grow
rapidly
and
after
shedding
their
skins
they
change
to
the
second
nymph
stage
this
shedding
of
their
skins
or
molting
occurs
five
times
before
they
mature
of
course
each
time
before
the
old
skin
or
suit
of
clothes
is
discarded
a
new
one
is
developed
beneath
the
females
may
continue
to
deposit

become
most
abundant
on
the
crop
late
in
the
fall
just
before
cold
weather
sets
in
the
adults
again
seek
winter
shelter
this
is
a
very
difficult
insect
to
control
since
it
feeds
on
liquid
sap
only
it
is
impossible
to
kill
it
by
spraying
the
crop
with
a
poison
such
as
arsenate
of
lead
it
can
not
chew
and
swallow
such
poison
the
young
can
be
killed
fairly
well
with
a
spray
or
dust
containing
nicotine
but
such
treatments
are
not
effective
against
the
adults
or
nearly
mature
nymphs
a
better
method
is
to
destroy
all
the
bugs
possible
in
the
fall
before
they
go
to
the
winter
protection
and
then

the
ant
the
ants
are
closely
related
to
the
bees
and
are
similar
to
them
in
many
respects
they
live
in
colonies
consisting
of
workers
drones
and
a
queen
the
males
or
drones
appear
at
swarming
time
and
the
workers
are
divided
into
various
castes
warriors
guards
nurses
etc
those
families
of
ants
however
which
seem
to
have
what
approaches
real
intelligence
far
outstrip
the
bees
in
many
respects
in
some
cases
ants
seem
to
be
able
to
plan
and
carry
out
lines
of
work
very
much
the
same
as
man
does
the
various
stages
of
human
intelligence
or
races
of
men
from
the
savage
to
the
intelligent
man
are
in
a
way
similar
to
the
various
races
of
ants
there
are
ants
which
live
as
hunters
others
which
live
as
shepherds
and
still
others
more
highly
developed
which
grow
crops
either
in
or
near
the
nest
as
is
the
case
with
the
fungus
growing
ants
this
striking
similarity
between
the
development
of
ants
and
man
offers
ground
for
much
speculation

some

may

value
to

while
others
are
the
source
of
great
annoyance
and
injury
the
tidy
housewife
usually
places
the
ant
in
the
same
category
with
cockroaches
and
and
the
corn
growers
attribute
much
of
the
injury
to
young
corn
to
the
work
of
the
small
cornfield
ant
which
acts
as
a
shepherd
of
the
corn
ants
are
usually
more
destructive
by
protecting
and
caring
for
other
pests
than
by
attacking
the
crop
direct
every
country
child
is
familiar
with
ants
they
are
met
every
day
during
the
summer
scampering
across
paths
tugging
at
some
unfortunate
insect
or
sticking
to
one
tongue
when
he
eats
berries
ants
are
as
numerous
as
the
stars
in
the
skies
and
vary
in
size
they
are
found
from
the
tropics
to
the
frozen
north
in
deserts
swamps
and
in
fact
almost
any
place
where
plants
or
animals
live
they
do
not
waste
time
building
or
manufacturing
a
complicated
nest
like
wasps
and
bees
so
when
food
is
scare
or
for
other
reasons
they
need
to
move
they
simply
pack
up
and
migrate
this
together
with
the
fact
that
they
feed
on
almost
every
imaginable
kind
of
plant
and
animal
material
accounts
in
part
for
the
fact
that
they
are
the
rulers
of
the
insect
world
studies
and
observations
it
is
easy
to
study
the
life
of
ants
but
it
is
most
difficult
to
follow
their
activities
in
the
nest
go
into
the
field
or
out
on
the
school
grounds
and
watch
along
paths
or
bare
spots
for
ants
soon
red
or
black
fellows
will
be
seen
hurrying
along
after
food
ants
are
always
in
a

when
they
are
after
food
follow
them
and

them
catch
and
carry

small
insects
if
they
do
not

or
other

a
small

one
of
them

what
happens
can
they
drag
away
a

as
large
as
themselves
some
of
them
may
be
after
honey
dew
fruit
juice
or
other
material
of
this
nature

they

the

usually
makes

ridge
all
the

while
some
of
the

are
making

others
are

watch
for
some
of
these

they

what
is

do
you
find
any
small

these
are
the
young

and
they
are
perfectly
helpless
and
must
be
fed

the
