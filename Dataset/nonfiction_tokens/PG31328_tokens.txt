the

the
feeling

blood
was
shed
and
the

were
compelled
to
look
to
some
spot
where
they
could
abide
in

it
was
in
these
stirring
times
that
the
convention
movement
which
means
the
marshalling
of
the
moral
forces
within
the
negro
came
into
existence
the
forces
which
it
evoked
were
conserved
and
correlated
until
the
dynamics
of
civil
revolution
had
wrought
desolation
and
destruction
far
and
wide
sweeping
away
forever
what
had
been
a
basis
of
the
social
and
political
strength
of
the
nation
prior
to
this
time
there
had
been
a
local
convention
held
in
philadelphia
january
to
protest
against
the
action
of
the
american
colonization
society
that
had
been
organized

remove
systematically
from

a

at
the
list
of
the
officers
of
this
the
pioneer
deliberative
convention
of
colored
people
of
which
we
have
as
yet
any
date
shows
that
the
men
who
led
in
this
meeting
as
in
the
movement
of
which
this
paper
is
a
study
were
among
the
foremost
colored
citizens
whose
names
have
come
down
to
us
from
that
distant
past
james
forten
was
president
and
russell
parrott
the
assistant
to
absalom
jones
at

was
the

and
randall
shepherd
the
convention
which
assembled
in
and
was
the
first
conscious
step
toward
concerted
action
was
in
no
sense
local
either
in
its
conception
or
its
constituency
the
prime
mover
was
hezekiah
grice
a
native
of
baltimore
where
he
was
born
just
one
hundred
years
ago
in
his
early
life
grice
had
met
benjamin
lundy
and
in
william
lloyd
garrison
editors
and
publishers
of
the
genius
of
universal
emancipation
published
at
that
time
in
baltimore
in
the
spring
of
he
wrote
a
circular
letter
to
prominent
colored
men
in
the
free
states
requesting
their
views
on
the
feasibility
and
imperative
necessity
of
holding
a
convention
of
the
free
colored
men
of
the
country
at
some
point
north
of
mason
dixon
line
for
the
exchange
of
views
on
the
question
of
emigration
or
the
adoption
of
a
policy
that
would
make
living
in
the
united
states
more
endurable
for
several
months
grice
received
no
response
whatever
to
this
circular
in
august
however
he
received
an
urgent
request
for
him
to
come
at
once
to
philadelphia
on
his
arrival
there
he
found
a
meeting
in
session
discussing
conflicting
reports
relative
to
the
openings
for
colored
people
as
emigrants
to
canada
bishop
richard

at
whose

was
in

church
new
york
peter
vogelsang
and
thomas

place
approving
the

of

this
approval
decided
the
philadelphians
to
take
definite
action
and
they
immediately
issued
a
call
for
a

of
the

of

as

clergyman
of
sound
scholarship
was
a
new

and
thenceforth
an
active
participant
in
the
movement
this
convention
aroused
no
little
interest
among
the
foremost
friends
of

we
find
the
following
a
convention
of
people
of
color
was
held
in
philadelphia
in
of
delegates
from
several
states
to
consult
upon
the
common
interest
it
was
numerously
attended
and
the
proceedings
were
conducted
with
much
ability
a
resolution
was
adopted
that
it
was
expedient
to
establish
a
collegiate
school
on
the
manual
labor
system
a
committee
appointed
for
the
purpose
made
an
appeal
to
the
benevolent
new
haven
was
suggested
as
a
suitable
place
for
its
location
arthur
tappan
purchased
several
acres
of
land
in
the
southerly
part
of
the
city
and
made
arrangements
for
the
erection
of
a
suitable
building
and
furnished
it
with
needful
supplies
in
a
way
to
do
honor
to
the
city
and
country
the
people
of
new
haven
became
violently
agitated
in
opposition
to
the
plan
the
city
was
filled
with
confusion
they
seemed
to
fear
that
the
city
would
be
overrun
with
negroes
from
all
parts
of
the
world
a
public
meeting
called
by

in
spite
of
a
manly
protest
by

subsequently
governor
of

state
and
senator
from

adopted
the
following
resolved
by

aldermen
common
council
and
freemen
of
the
city
of

in
city
meeting
assembled
that
we
will
resist
the
establishment
of
the
proposed
college
in
this
place
by
every
lawful
means
the
attempt
at
the
founding
of
a
college
in
connecticut
was
abandoned
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
more
than
mention
the
prudence
crandall
incident
that
disgraced
the
name
of
connecticut
at
the
same
period
what
was
a
kind
of
national
executive
committee
and
known
as
the
convention
board
issued
the
calls
for
the
convention
from
time
to
time
when
the
next
convention
was
held
in

were
eight
states
represented

an
attendance
of
thirty
delegates

it
continued
in

until

question
exciting
the
greatest
interest
was
one
which
proposed
the
purchase
of
other
lands
for
settlement
in
canada
for
acres
of
land
had
already
been
secured
two
thousand
individuals
had
left
the
soil
of
their
birth
crossed
the
line
and
laid
the
foundation
for
a
structure
which
promised
an
asylum
for
the
colored
population
of
the
united
states
they
had
already
erected
two
hundred
log
houses
and
acres
of
land
had
been
brought
under
cultivation
but
hostility
to
the
settlement
of
the
negro
in
that
section
had
been
manifested
by
canadians
many
of
whom
would
sell
no
land
to
the
negro
this
may
explain
the
hesitation
of
the
convention
and
the
appointment
of
an
agent
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
further
investigation
and
report
to
a
subsequent
convention
opposition
to
the
colonization
movement
was
emphasized
by
a
strong
protest
against
any
appropriation
by
congress
in

of
the
american
colonization
society

showing

and
a
most
significant
action
was

recommending

country
of

at
which
no

from

all

was
admitted
at
the

convention
the
phoenix

came
up
for

referred

these
names
suggest
that
the

movement
was
not
confined
to
any
special
social
clique

was
a
somewhat
wide

institution

offered
abundant
testimony
of
the
ability
of
this
body
to
set
before
the
nation
a
detail
of
the
wrongs
and
grievances
to
which
they
are
by
custom

subjected

they
also
exhibit

noble
resolution

contend
by
moral
force

until
their
rights
so
long
withheld

restored

notable
things
robert

to
take

action

promote
the
sentiment

stirring
address

should
be
removed
from
the
name
of
the
churches
lodges
societies
and
other
institutions
in
in
the
columns
of
the
liberator
appear
calls
for
two
conventions
the
regular
annual
convention
was
called
to
meet
in
philadelphia
june
by
henry
sipkins
of
the
convention
board
and
the
urgent
language
of
the
call
implies
doubt
in
the
interest
of
the
people
or
the
probability
of
their
prompt
response
to
the
calls
william
whipper
issued
the
call
through
the
same
medium
for
the
convention
of
the
american
moral
reform
to
meet
august
also
in
philadelphia
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
careful
perusal
of
the
files
of
the
liberator
fails
to
disclose
a
comment
on
the
proceedings
of
either
convention
but
the
perusal
of
the
officers
of
the
american
moral
reform
shows
the
influential
man
of
the
convention
movement
at
their
helm
james
forten
the
revolutionary
patriot
was
the
president
reuben
ruby
rev
samuel
cornish
rev
walter
proctor
and
jacob
white
of
philadelphia
were
vice
presidents
joseph
cassey
was
treasurer
robert
purvis
foreign
corresponding
secretary
and
james
forten
recording
secretary
the
address
was
drawn
up
by
william
watkins
of
baltimore
who
two
decades
later
was
an
able
colleague
of
frederick
douglass
in
the
conduct
of
the
north
star
in
the
convention
of
the
american
moral
reform
was
again
held
in
philadelphia
august
in
which
william
whipper
john
burr
and
james
forten
were
leading
spirits
at
the
adjournment
an
extra
meeting
was
held
in
thomas
church
at
which
an
address
on
temperance
was
delivered
by
john
francis
cook
of
washington
sufficient
has
now
been
stated
to
show
that
the
convention
movement
was
now
deeply
rooted
in
the
thought
of
the
disfranchised
american
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lull
does
not
at
all
disprove
this
contention
the
conventions
were
great
educators
alike
of
the
negro
and
the
american
whites
they
taught
the
former
parliamentary
usages
and
how
to
conduct
deliberative
bodies
they
brought
to
light
facts
pertaining
to
the
status
which
tended
to
establish
that
he
was
thrifty
and
steadily
improving
as
a
moral
and
economic
force
while
the
american
whites
had
in
them
an
object
lesson
from
which
they
learned
much
in
his
autobiography
of
a
fugitive
negro
samuel
ringgold
ward
says
a
state
or
a
national
convention
of
black
men
is
held
the
talent
displayed
the
order
maintained
the
demeanor
of
the
delegates
all
impress
themselves
upon
the
community
all
agree
that
to
keep
a
people
rooted
to
the
soil
who
are
rapidly
improving
who
have
already
attained
considerable
influence
and
are
marshalled
by
gifted
leaders
men
who
show
themselves
qualified
for
legislative
and
judicial
positions
and
to
doom
them
to
a
state
of
perpetual
vassalage
is
altogether
out
of
the
question
the
work
of
unifying
the
race
along
right
lines
now
proceeded
with
the
holding
of
state
conventions
there
was
a
state
temperance
convention
of
the
colored
men
of
connecticut
held
at
middletown
followed
by
a
call
for
a
new
england
convention
at
boston
in
october
reference
to
its
proceedings
shows
a
prior
convention
held
at
providence
in
may
at
the
boston
convention
a
ringing
appeal
was
made
to
the
people
for
total
abstinence
from
all
intoxicants
and
almost
immediately
thereafter
local
meetings
were
held
for
the
purpose
of
putting
in
practical
operation
the
principles
enunciated
not
only
in
new
england
but
in
the
middle
and
western
states
local
conventions
were
held
during
the
next
decade
the
following
extracts
from
a
letter
from
the
veteran
educator
peter
clark
shed
a
flood
of
light
upon
this
early
movement
cromwell
washington
my
dear
sir
the
people
of
ohio
held
conventions
annually
for
more
than
thirty
years
usually
they
printed
their
proceedings
in
pamphlets
a
peculiarity
of
the
ohio
conventions
was
that
they
were
meant
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
colored
people
of
that
state
the
conventions
of
those
residing
in
the
more
eastern
states
were
simply
conventions
and
their
memorials
and
protests
were
aimed
at
slavery
the
first
conventions
of
the
men
of
ohio
were
by
their
own
sacrifices
and
with
the
help
of
friends
they
purchased
lots
and
erected
school
houses
in
a
number
of
towns
or
they
organized
schools
and
located
them
in
churches
active
in
this
work
were
the
yancy
charles
and
walter
gideon
and
charles
langston
brothers
of
john
george
carey
dennis
hill
and
chief
among
them
david
jenkins
walter
yancy
was
the
agent
of
these
men
travelling
and
organizing
societies
and
schools
collecting
funds
etc
as
a
result
of
this
movement
a
number
of
farming
communities
were
established
some
of
which
accumulated
large
areas
of
land
and
in
cincinnati
the
iron
chest
company
accumulated
funds
and
in
erected
a
block
of
buildings
which
still
stands
later
the
action
of
the
convention
was
directed
against
the
black
laws
of
ohio
these
were
repealed
in
and
colored
children
were
permitted
to
share
in
the
benefits
of
the
school
funds
though
in
separate
schools
the
same
legislature
elected
salmon
chase
to
the
united
states
senate
the
movement
thus
detailed
was
the
result
of
a
bargain
between
the
democrats
of
ohio
and
the
free
soilers
afterwards
the
force
of
these
conventions
was
directed
against
discriminations
against
colored
people
which
still
existed
on
the
statute
books
sometimes
this
force
took
the
shape
of
petitions
memorials
protests
and
after
the
organization
of
the
ohio
equal
rights
league
it
took
the
shape
of
legal
proceedings
etc
one
of
the
most
memorable
of
these
conventions
was
held
in
when
john
langston
delivered
the
best
speech
of
his
life
defending
the
thesis
there
is
a
mutual
repellency
between
the
white
and
black
races
of
the
world
the
materials
for
the
speech
were
collected
by
charles
langston
but
john
made
the
speech
time
has
vindicated
the
position
taken
by
langston
in
that
memorable
address
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
emigration
movement
in
which
martin
delaney
afterwards
became
prominent
effective
national
conventions
have
not
been
numerous
in
the
past
fifty
years
one
of
the
most
notable
met
at
rochester
in
frederick
douglass
presided
and
i
had
the
honor
of
being
the
secretary
it
was
reported
that
stowe
desired
to
give
a
portion
of
her
earnings
from
uncle
tom
for
the
founding
of
a
school
for
the
benefit
of
the
and
this
convention
was
called
to
formulate
an
advisory
plan
the
plan
when
formulated
was
practically
what
washington
realized
many
years
afterwards
at
tuskegee
if
you
knew
douglass
you
perhaps
know
that
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
devoted
to
an
attempt
to
found
such
a
school
the
rochester
movement
came
to
naught
but
its
influence
upon
the
colored
people
of
the
country
was
wide
spread
chiefly
because
of
the
character
of
the
men
who
composed
it
its
proceedings
were
published
in
the
north
star
and
so
far
as
i
know
nowhere
else
the
file
of
that
paper
was
destroyed
with
douglass
rochester
house
and
unless
in
the
congressional
library
no
copy
now
exists
the
convention
at
syracuse
was
another
assemblage
its
was
the
formulation
of
a
plan
of
organization
known
as
the
national
equal
rights
league
the
rivalry
between
douglass
and
langston
prevented
the
wide
usefulness
of
which
the
organization
was
capable
ohio
pennsylvania
and
illinois
organized
auxiliary
state
leagues
and
in
each
state
much
good
was
done
langston
president

of
the
national
organization
never
called
it
together
i
have
written
at
length
and
yet
have
not
answered
your
questions
as
to
men
whose
names
deserve
to
be
embalmed
in
your
proposed
book
it
will
take
time
and
thought
for
the
compilation
of
such
a
list
the
men
who
officiated
in
the
conventions
of
which
i
have
written
were
mostly
small
men
great
only
in
their
zeal
for
the
welfare
of
their
people

within
these
ten
years
from
to
a
new
figure
appears
on
the
scene
a
man
though
not
born
free
like
paul
yet
like
the
chief
captain
obtained
it
at
a
great
price
the
career
of

was
but
preliminary
prior
to
his
return
from
england
and
his
settlement
at
rochester
as
editor
of
the
north
star
by
a
most
remarkable
coincidence
the
very
first
article
in
the
first
number
of

published

is
an
extended
notice
of

each
the
presence
of
one
delegate
benjamin
weeden
from
a
large
constituency
northampton
whose
credentials
stated
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
white
citizens
sympathizing
with
the
objects
of
the
call
had
formerly
expressed
their
endorsement
of
the
movement
was
a
signal
for
hearty
applause
a
most
spirited
discussion
arose
on
the
report
of
the
committee
of
education
as
to
the
expediency
of
the
establishment
of
a
college
for
colored
young
men
which
was
discussed
pro
and
con
by
arguments
that
can
not
be
surpassed
even
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
half
a
century
the
report
gives
unstinted
praise
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
for
his
scholarly
style
his
choice
diction
his
grace
of
manner
and
this
statement
excites
no
surprise
when
we
learn
that
this
chairman
was
alexander
crummell
the
next
year
september
between
sixty
and
seventy

the

was
not
deflected
as
in

education
was
encouraged
the
importance
of
statistical
information
stated
and
temperance
societies
urged
as
showing
the
representative
character
of

the
diversity

of
all
the
conventions
of
the
period
the
largest
that
in
which
the
ability
of
its
members
was
best
displayed
in
the
broad
and
statesmanlike
treatment
of
the
questions
discussed
and
the
practical
action
which
vindicated
their
right
to
recognition
as
enfranchised
citizens
and
the
one
to
which
the
attention
of
the
american
people
was
attracted
as
never
before
was
the
one
held
in
the
city
of
rochester
y
with
greater
emphasis
than
at
prior
meetings
this
convention
set
the
seal
of
its
opposition
against
any
hope
for
permanent
relief
to
the
conditions
under
which
the
colored
freeman
labored
by
any
comprehensive
scheme
of
emigration
because
of
this
it
directed
its
energies
to
affirmative
constructive
action
in
the
enunciation
of
a
philosophy
able
and
statesmanlike
contained
in
the
address
to
the
american
people

behold
the
wisdom
of
a
master
mind
one
then
at
the
prime
of
his
intellectual
and
physical
powers
frederick
douglass
the
chairman
of
the
business
committee
among
the
important
things
done
by
the
convention
might
be
enumerated
it
says
we
can
not
announce
the
discovery
of
any
new
principle
adopted
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
mankind
the
great
truths
of
moral
and
political
science
upon
which
we
rely
and
which
press
upon
your
consideration
have
been
evolved
and
enunciated
by
you
we
point
to
your
principles
your
wisdom
and
your
great
example
as
the
full
justification
of
our
course
this
day
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
is
the
right
of
all
that
taxation
and
representation
should
go
together
that
the
constitution
of
the
united

was
formed
to
establish
justice
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
all
the
people
of
the
country
that
resistance
to

is
obedience

authorized
to
receive
funds
in
the
name
of
the
colored
people
of
the
country
for
that
purpose
the
successful
establishment
and
conduct
of
such
an
institution
of

would
train

workmen
fitted
to
hold

in

on
the
conditions
prevailing
here
a

throughout

was
provided
for

all

further
authorized
to
publish
replies
to
any
assaults
worthy
of
note
made
upon
the
character
or
condition
of
the
colored
people
this
was
in
keeping
with
what
had
actually
been
done
by
the
colored
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
the
year
previous
after
its
governor
ward
hunt
had
substantially
recommended
the
passage
of
black
laws
which
would
have
forbidden
the
settlement
of
any
blacks
or
mulattoes
within
its
borders
and
placed
further
restrictions
on
those
at
that
time
citizens
the
charge
of
unthrift
against
the
negro
was
utterly
disproven
by
a
comparative
statement
showing
that
in
those
places
in
which
the
conditions
were
the
worst
new
york
brooklyn
and
williamsburg
the
negro
had
increased
per
cent
in
population
in
twenty
years
and
per

in
real
estate
holdings
in
thirteen
counties
the
amount
owned
by
colored
persons
was
ascertained
to
be
capital

exclusive
of
incumbrance
new

the
north

vol
the
convention
crowned
its
work
by
a
more
comprehensive
plan
of
organization
than
those
of
twenty
years
before
a
national
council
was
provided
for
to
be
composed
of
two
members
from
each
state
by
elections
to
be
held
at
a
poll
at
which
each
colored
inhabitant
may
vote
who
pays
ten
cents
as
a

and
each
state
shall
elect
at
such
election
delegates
to
state
conventions
twenty
in
number
from
each
state
at
large
the
detail
of
this
plan
shows
that
the
methods
of
the
council
of

an
almost
exact
copy
of
the
national
council
of
the
chairman
of
the

all
of

men
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
information
and
ability
but
those
who
saw
only
in
emigration
the
solution
of
the
evils
with
which
they
were
beset
immediately
called
another
convention
to
consider
and
decide
upon
the
subject
of
emigration
from

according
to
the
call
no

would
introduce
the
subject
of

to

uncalled

as

too
narrow

illiberal
to
meet
with
acceptance
among

will
omit
during
the
coming
twelve
months
an
opportunity
which
may
offer
to
buy
a
piece

property
a

lot
a
farm

anything
else

james
whitfield

buffalo

the
signers

the
call
responded
to
the
attacks
in
the
same
journal
douglass
made
a
reply
and
whitfield
responded
again
and
so
on
until
several
articles
on
each
side
were
produced
by
these
and
other
disputants
the
articles
were
collected
and
published
in
pamphlet
form
by
rev
and
bishop
james
theodore
holly

au
prince
haiti
making
a
valuable
contribution
to
literature
for
i
doubt
if
there
is
anywhere
throughout
the
range
of
controversial
literature
anything
to
surpass
it
i
am
indebted
to
bishop
holly
for
further
information
respecting
this
convention

holly
was
the
first
to
execute
his
mission
going
down
to
hayti
in
when
he
entered
into
relations
with
the
minister
of
the
interior

father
of
the
late
president
hyppolite
and
by
him
was
presented

canada
west
in
when
the
report
on
haiti
was
made
delaney
went
off
on
his
mission
to
the
niger
valley
africa
via
england
in
there
he
concluded
a
treaty

himself
and
eight
kings

inducements
for
negro
emigrants
to
their
territories
whitfield
went
to
california
intending
to
go
later
from
thence
to
central
america
but
died
in
san
francisco
before
he
could
do
so
meanwhile
james
redpath
went
to
haiti
as
a
john
brownist
after
the
harper
ferry
raid
and
reaped
the
first
fruits
of
mission
by
being
appointed
haitian
commissioner
of
emigration
in
the
united
states
by
the
haitian
government
but
with
the
express
injunction
that
rev
holly
should
be
called
to
with
him
on
arrival
in
the
united
states
he
tendered
rev
holly
a
commission
from
the
haitian
government
at
per
annum
and
to
engage
emigrants
to
go
to
haiti
the
first
ship
load
of
emigrants
were
from
philadelphia
in
not
more
than
of
the
emigrants
to
haiti
received
through
this
movement
permanently
abided
there
they
proved
to
be
neither
intellectually
industrially
nor
financially
prepared
to
undertake
to
wring
from
the
soil
the
riches
that
it
is
ready
to
yield
up
to
such
as
shall
be
thus
prepared
nor
are
the
government
and
influential
individuals
sufficiently
instructed
in
social
industrial
and
financial
problems
which
now
govern
the
world
to
turn
to
profitable
use
willing
workers
among
the
laboring
class
the
civil
war
put
a
stop
to
the
african
emigration
project
by
delaney
taking
the
commission
of
major
from
president
lincoln
and
the
central
american
project
died
out
with
whitfield
leaving
the
haitian
emigration
as
the
only
remaining
practical
outcome
of
the
emigration
convention
of
the
civil
war
destroyed
many
landmarks
and
the
national
colored
convention
confined
to
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
and
the
border
states
was
a
thing
of
the
past
just
after
one
of
the
darkest
periods
of
that
strife
when
the
dawn
was
apparent
there
assembled
in
the
city
of
syracuse
the
last
national
colored
convention
in
which
the
men
who
began
the
movement
in
their
successors
and
their
sons
had
the
control
the
sphere
of
influence
even
in
that
had
somewhat
increased
for
southeastern
virginia
louisiana
and
tennessee
had
some
representation
slavery
was
dead
the
colonizationists
to
canada
the
west
indies
and
africa
had
abandoned
the
field
of
openly
aiming
to
commit
the
policy
of
the
race
to
what
was
considered
expatriation
reconstruction
even
in
was
seen
in
the
south
peering
above
the
horizon
the
equal
rights
league
came
forth
displacing
the
national
council
of
yet
with
the
same
object
of
the
legal
rights
association
organized
by
hezekiah
grice
in
baltimore
in
john
mercer
langston
stepped
in
the
arena
at
the
head
of
the
new
organization
but
under
more
favorable
auspices
than
was
begun
in
the
movement
of
a
study
of
its
rise
progress
and
decline
belongs
to
another
period
of
the
evolution
of
the
free
negro
this
survey
of
the
early
negro
convention
movement
has
been
rapid
the
treatment
broad
the
sketch
is
but
an
outline
lights
and
shadows
will
be
supplied
by
more
detailed
study
but
the
perspective
will
reveal
clear
and
distinct
these
four
facts
the
convention
movement
begun
in
demonstrates
the
ability
of
the
negro
to
construct
a
platform
broad
enough
for
a
race
to
stand
upon
and
to
outline
a
policy
alike
and
statesmanlike
that
has
not
been
surpassed
in
the
seventy
years
that
have
elapsed
the
earnestness
the
enthusiasm
and
the
efficiency
with
which
the
work
aimed
at
was
done
the
singleness
of
purpose
the
public
spirit
and
the
intrepidity
manifested
encouraged
and
inspired
such
men
as
benjamin
lundy
william
lloyd
garrison
gerrit
smith
jocelyn
arthur
and
lewis
tappan
william
goodell
and
beriah
green
to
greater
efforts
and
persistence
in
behalf
of
the
disfranchised
american
accomplishing
at
last
the
tremendous
work
of
revolutionizing
the
public
sentiment
of
the
country
and
making
the
institution
of
radical
reforms
possible
the
preparatory
training
which
the
convention
work
gave
fitted
its
leaders
for
the
broader
arena
of
abolitionism
and
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
mere
coincidence
that
the
only
colored
men
who
were
among
the
organizers
of
the
american
society
in
robert
purvis
and
james
barbadoes
were
both
promoters
and
leaders
in
the
convention
movement
