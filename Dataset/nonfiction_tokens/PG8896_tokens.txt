preface
in
writing
this
work
i
have
endeavored
to
provide
a
suited
to
more
advanced
pupils
my
idea
of
such
a
work
was
that
it
should
present
the
essential
facts
of
history
in
due
order
and
in
conformity
to
the
best
and
latest
researches
that
it
should
point
out
clearly
the
connection
of
events
and
of
successive
eras
with
one
another
that
through
the
interest
awakened
by
the
natural
unforced
view
gained
of
this
unity
of
history
and
by
such
illustrative
incidents
as
the
brevity
of
the
narrative
would
allow
to
be
wrought
into
it
the
dryness
of
a
mere
summary
should
be
as
far
as
possible
relieved
and
that
finally
being
a
book
intended
for
pupils
and
readers
of
all
classes
it
should
be
free
from
sectarian
partiality
and
should
limit
itself
to
judgments
and
conclusions
on
all
matters
subject
to
party
contention
respecting
one
of
the
points
just
referred
to
i
can
say
that
in
composing
this
work
i
have
myself
been
more
than
ever
impressed
with
unity
of
and
affected
by
this
great
and
deeply
moving
drama
that
is
still
advancing
into
a
future
that
is
hidden
from
view
i
can
not
but
hope
that
this
feeling
spontaneous
and
vivid
in
my
own
mind
may
communicate
itself
to
the
reader
in
his
progress
through
these
pages
the
most
interesting
object
in
the
study
of
history
is
to
quote
arnold
words
that
which
most
nearly
touches
the
inner
life
of
civilized
man
namely
the
vicissitudes
of
institutions
social
political
and
religious
but
as
the
same
scholar
adds
a
knowledge
of
the
external
is
needed
before
we
arrive
at
that
which
is
within
we
want
to
get
a
sort
of
frame
for
our
picture
thus
we
want
to
know
clearly
the
geographical
boundaries
of
different
countries
and
their
external
revolutions
this
leads
us
in
the
first
instance
to
geography
and
military
history
even
if
our
ultimate
object
lies
beyond
something
more
is
aimed
at
in
the
present
work
than
the
construction
of
this
frame
without
which
to
be
sure
a
student
wanders
about
vaguely
like
an
ignorant
man
in
an
museum
by
the
use
of
different
sorts
of
type
it
has
been
practicable
to
introduce
a
considerable
amount
of
detail
without
breaking
the
main
current
of
the
narrative
or
making
it
too
long
by
means
of
these
additional
passages
and
by
appending
lists
of
books
at
the
close
of
the
several
periods
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
aid
younger
students
in
carrying
forward
the
study
of
history
beyond
the
usual
requirements
of
the
i
make
no
apology
for
the
sketches
presented
of
the
history
of
science
literature
art
and
of
moral
and
material
decline
or
improvement
professor
seeley
in
his
interesting
book
on
expansion
of
is
disposed
to
confine
history
to
the
civil
community
and
to
the
part
of
human
which
depends
on
that
that
a
man
in
england
he
tells
us
makes
a
scientific
discovery
or
paints
a
picture
is
not
in
itself
an
event
in
the
history
of
england
but
of
course
as
this
able
writer
himself
remarks
history
may
assume
a
larger
or
a
narrower
function
and
i
am
persuaded
that
to
shut
up
history
within
so
narrow
bounds
is
not
expedient
in
a
work
designed
in
part
to
stimulate
readers
to
wide
and
continued
studies
one
who
has
long
been
engaged
in
historical
study
and
teaching
if
he
undertakes
to
prepare
such
a
work
as
the
present
has
occasion
to
traverse
certain
periods
where
previous
investigations
have
made
him
feel
more
or
less
at
home
elsewhere
at
least
his
course
must
be
to
collate
authorities
follow
such
as
he
deems
best
entitled
to
credit
and
on
points
of
uncertainty
satisfy
himself
by
recurrence
to
the
original
sources
of
evidence
among
the
numerous
works
from
which
i
have
derived
assistance
the
largest
debt
is
due
especially
in
the
ancient
and
medi√¶val
periods
to
weber
der
which
in
its
nineteenth
edition
contains
large
octavo
pages
of
matter
duruy
du
moyen
eleventh
edition
and
also
his
des
temps
ninth
edition
have
yielded
to
me
important
aid
from
the
writings
of
freeman
i
have
constantly
derived
instruction
in
particular
i
have
made
use
of
his
sketch
of
european
which
is
published
in
this
country
under
the
title
of
and
of
his
lucid
compact
and
thorough
of
european
the
other
writings
however
of
this
able
and
learned
historian
have
been
very
helpful
tillinghast
edition
of
ploetz
i
have
found
to
be
a
highly
valuable
storehouse
of
historical
facts
and
have
frequently
consulted
it
with
advantage
the
superior
accuracy
of
george
is
the
reason
why
i
have
freely
availed
myself
of
the
aid
afforded
by
them
professor
now
president
adams
excellent
of
historical
to
which
reference
is
repeatedly
made
in
the
following
pages
has
been
of
service
in
preparing
the
lists
of
works
to
be
read
or
consulted
those
lists
it
hardly
need
be
said
aim
at
nothing
like
a
complete
bibliography
no
doubt
to
each
of
them
other
valuable
works
might
easily
be
added
as
a
rule
no
mention
is
made
of
more
technical
or
abstruse
writings
collections
of
documents
and
so
forth
the
titles
of
but
few
historical
novels
are
given
useful
as
the
best
of
these
are
works
of
this
class
are
often
inaccurate
and
misleading
so
that
a
living
master
in
historical
authorship
has
said
even
of
walter
scott
who
is
so
strong
when
he
stands
on
scottish
soil
that
in
his
ivanhoe
there
is
a
mistake
in
every
line
with
regard
however
to
historical
fiction
including
poems
as
well
as
novels
and
tales
the
student
will
find
in
justin
winsor
very
learned
and
elaborate
monograph
forming
a
distinct
section
of
the
catalogue
of
the
boston
public
library
the
most
full
information
up
to
the
date
of
its
publication
most
of
the
historical
maps
to
illustrate
the
text
of
the
present
work
have
been
engraved
from
drawings
after
spruner
putzger
freeman
etc
of
the
ancient
maps
several
have
been
adopted
in
a
revised
form
from
a
general
atlas
that
the
maps
contain
more
places
than
are
referred
to
in
the
text
is
not
a
disadvantage
i
wish
to
express
my
obligation
to
a
number
of
friends
who
have
kindly
lent
me
aid
in
the
revisal
of

and
the
next
following
pages
of
the

the
work
has
been
subjected
to
a
careful

the
aim
has
been
to
make
whatever
amendments
are
called
for
by
historical
investigations
in
the
interval
since
it
was
published
besides
corrections
brief
statements
have
been
woven
here
and
there
into
the
text
the
revision
has
embraced
the
bibliography
connected
with
the
successive
periods
or
chapters
titles
of
books
which
are
no
longer
of
service
have
been
erased
titles
of
select
recent
publications
as
well
as
of
meritorious
writings
of
a
remoter
past
have
been
inserted
in
preparing
this
edition
for
the
press
i
have
not
been
without
the
advantage
of
aid
from
friends
versed
in
historical
studies
professor

besides
particular
annotations

prolonged
the
history
so
far
as
to
include
in
its
compass
in
chapter
vii
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
events
as
recent
as
the
close
of
the
south
african
war
and
the
accession
of
president
roosevelt
professor
charles

of

notes

own
on
oriental
history
a
portion
of
history
with
which
as
well
as
with
the
semitic
languages
he
is
conversant
it
will
not
be
for
lack

painstaking
if
any

introduction
definition
of
the
subject
of
history
is
man
history
has
for
its
object
to
record
his
doings
and
experiences
it
may
then
be
concisely
defined
as
a
narrative
of
past
events
in
which
men
have
been
concerned
to
describe
the
earth
the
abode
of
man
to
delineate
the
different
kingdoms
of
nature
and
to
inquire
into
the
origin
of
them
or
to
explain
the
physical
or
mental
constitution
of
human
beings
is
no
part
of
the
office
of
history
all
this
belongs
to
the
departments
of
natural
and
intellectual
science
but
history
as
we
now
understand
the
term
is
more
than
a
bare
record
of
what
men
have
done
and

it
aims
to
point
out
the
connection
of
events
with
one
another
it
seeks
to
explain
the

and
the
consequences
of

that

it
would
trace
the
steps
that
mark
the
progress
of
the

and
of
the
different
portions
of
it
through

periods
it
brings
to

the

which
unites
each
particular
stage
in
the
career
of
a
people
or
of
mankind
as
a
whole
with
what
went
before
and
with
what
came
after
history
has
been
called
the
biography
of
a
society
biography
has
to
do
with
the
career
of
an
individual
history
is
concerned
with
the
successive
actions
and
fortunes
of
a
community
in
its
broadest
extent
with
the
experiences
of
the
human
family
it
is
only
when
men
are
connected
by
the
social
bond
and
remain
so
united
for
a
greater
or
less
period
that
there
is
room
for
history
it
is
therefore
with
nations
in
their
internal
progress
and
in
their
mutual
relations
that
history
especially
deals
of
mere
clans
or
loosely
organized
tribes
it
can
have
little
to
say
history
can
go
no
farther
than
to
explore
their
genealogy
and
state
what
were
their
journeyings
and
habits
the
nation
is
a
form
of
society
that
rests
on
the
same
basis
a
basis
at
once
natural
and
part
of
a
divine
system
as
the
family
by
a
nation
is
meant
a
people
dwelling
in
a
definite
territory
living
under
the
same
government
and
bound
together
by
such
ties
as
a
common
language
a
common
religion
the
same
institutions
and
customs
the
elements
that
enter
into
that
national
spirit
which
is
the
bond
of
unity
are
multiple
they
vary
to
a
degree
in
different
peoples
as
individuals
are
not
alike
and
as
the
history
of
any
particular
community
is
modified
and
molded
by
these
individual
differences
so
the
course
of
the
history
of
mankind
is
shaped
by
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
various
nations
and
by
their
interaction
upon
one
another
in
like
manner
groups
of
nations
each
characterized
by
distinctive
traits
derived
from
affinities
of
race
or
of
religion
or
from
other
sources
act
on
each
other
and
thus
help
to
determine
the
course
of
the
historic
stream
scope
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
and
in
their
various
constituents
is
the
theme
of
history
it
does
not
limit
its
attention
to
a
particular
fraction
of
a
people
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
governments
and
rulers
and
the
public
doings
of
states
such
as
foreign
wars
and
the
struggles
of
rival
dynasties
naturally
form
a
prominent
topic
in
historical
writings
but
this
is
only
one
department
in
the
records
of
the
past
more
and
more
history
interests
itself
in
the
character
of
society
at
large
and
in
the
phases
through
which
it
has
passed
how
men
lived
from
day
to
day
what
their
occupations
were
their
comforts
and
discomforts
their
ideas
sentiments
and
modes
of
intercourse
their
state
as
regards
art
letters
invention
religious
enlightenment
these
are
points
on
which
history
as
at
present
studied
and
written
undertakes
to
shed
light
points
of
an
eminent
german
philosopher
of
our
day
intimates
that
there
are
five
phases
of
human
development
and
hence
five
points
of
view
from
which
the
course
of
history
is
to
be
surveyed
these
are
the
embracing
the
progress
of
truth
and
knowledge
the
the
including
art
in
all
its
higher
ramifications
the
and
the
political
an
able
english
scholar
resolves
the
elements
of
human
progress
and
thus
the
most
general
topics
of
history
into
three
the
moral
the
intellectual
and
the
productive
or
and
but
these
three
elements
he
adds
though
distinct
are
not
separate
but
closely
connected
with
each
other
the
philosophy
of
that
there
is
in
some
sense
a
reign
of
law
in
the
succession
of
human
events
is
a
conviction
warranted
by
observed
facts
as
well
as
inspired
by
religion
events
do
not
spring
into
being
disjoined
from
antecedents
leading
to
them
even
in
history
which
seem
at
the
first
glance
abrupt
are
found
to
be
dependent
on
previous
conditions
they
are
perceived
to
be
the
natural
issue
of
the
times
that
have
gone
before
preceding
events
have
foreshadowed
them
there
are
laws
of
historical
progress
which
have
their
root
in
the
characteristics
of
human
nature
ends
are
wrought
out
which
bear
on
them
evident
marks
of
design
history
as
a
whole
is
the
carrying
out
of
a
plan
through
the
ages
one
increasing
purpose
runs
long
ago
argued
that
he
who
has
not
left
even
the
entrails
of
the
smallest
and
most
insignificant
animal
or
the
feather
of
a
bird
or
the
little
flower
of
a
plant
or
the
leaf
of
a
tree
without
a
harmony
and
as
it
were
a
mutual
peace
among
all
its
parts
that
god
can
never
be
believed
to
have
left
the
kingdoms
of
men
their
dominations
and
servitudes
outside
of
the
laws
of
his
providence
to
discern
the
plan
of
history
and
the
causes
or
laws
through
which
it
is
accomplished
as
far
as
our
limited
capacity
will
allow
is
the
object
of
what
is
called
the
philosophy
of
history
freedom
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
man
is
a
free
agent
history
although
it
is
not
an
aimless
process
is
nevertheless
not
subject
to
the
forces
and
laws
which
govern
in
the
realm
of
matter
physical
analogies
are
not
a
literal
image
of
what
takes
place
in
the
sphere
of
intelligence
and
freedom
moral
evil
wherever
it
is
a
factor
in
history
has
its
origin
in
the
will
of
man
in
respect
to
it
the

permissive

his

emerge
a
worthy
goal
is
at
last
reached
despite
the
elements
of
disorder
introduced
by
human
perversity
nor
is
progress
continuous
and
unbroken
it
is
often
as
one
has
said
a
spiral
rather
than
a
straight
line
it
is
not
an
unceasing
advance
there
are
backward
movements
or
what
appear
to
be
such
of
particular
nations
it
is
frequently
evident
that
intellectually
and
morally
as
well
as
in
power
and
thrift
they
have
sunk
below
a
level
once
attained
of
the
inscrutable
blending
of
human
freedom
with
a
design
guizot
says
man
advances
in
the
execution
of
a
plan
which
he
has
not
conceived
and
of
which
he
is
not
even
aware
he
is
the
free
and
intelligent
artificer
of
a
work
which
is
not
his
own
conceive
a
great
machine
the
design
of
which
is
centered
in
a
single
mind
though
its
various
parts
are
intrusted
to
different
workmen
separated
from
and
strangers
to
each
other
no
one
of
them
understands
the
work
as
a
whole
nor
the
general
result
which
he
concurs
in
producing
but
every
one
executes
with
intelligence
and
freedom
by
rational
and
voluntary
acts
the
particular
task
assigned
to
him
on
the
history
of
lect
xi
personal
the
progress
of

has
been
inseparably
connected
with
the
agency
of
eminent

signal
changes
whether
wholesome
or
mischievous
are
linked
to
the
names
of
individuals
who
have
specially
contributed

the
achievements
of
heroes
stand
out
in
as

relief
in
authentic

as
in
the
obscure
era
of

and

fruitful
inventions
after
the
earlier
steps
in

taken
are
traceable
to
particular
authors
exalted
by
their
genius
above
the

so
it
is
with
the
literary
works
which
have
exerted
the
deepest
and
most
lasting
influence

from
individuals
in
whose
minds
they
are

and
by
whose
energy
they
are
effected
the
force
thus
exerted
by
the
leaders
in

is
not
accounted
for
by
reference
to
general
laws
great
men
are
not
puppets
moved
by
the
spirit
of
the
time
to
be
sure
there
must
be
a
preparation
for
them
and
a
groundwork
of
sympathy
among
their
contemporaries
otherwise
their
activity
would
call
forth
no
response
independently
of
the
age
that
gives
them
birth
their
power
would
lose
its
distinctive

they

be

had
he
been
born

nor
could
he

played
his

what
he
was
had
not
the
religious
and
political
struggles
of
england
for
generations
framed
a
theater
adapted
to
his
talents

character
could
not

in

his

would
have

no

in

rude
and

attractions
of

nevertheless
his

creative
cromwell

michael

and
such
as
they
are
not
the
passive
organs
the
mere
outcome
of

without
the
original
thought
and
personal
energy
of
leaders
momentous
changes
in
the
life
of
nations
could
never
have
taken
place
a
great
man
may
be
obliged
to
wait
long
for
the
answering
sympathy
which
is
required
to
give
effect
to
his
thoughts
and
purposes
such
a
mind
is
said
to
be
in
advance
of
the
age
another
generation
may
have
to
appear
before
the
harvest
springs
from
the
seed
that
he
has
sown
moreover
it
is
not
true
that
great
men
efficient
leaders
come
forward
whenever
there
is
an
exigency
calling
for
them
or
an
urgent
need
rather
is
it
true
that
terrible
disasters
sometimes
occur
at
critical
points
in
history
just
for
the
lack
of
leaders
fit
for
the
emergency
the
meaning
of
a
thoughtful
student
can
hardly
fail
to
propose
to
himself
the
question
what
is
the
meaning
of
history
why
is
this
long
drama
with
all
that
is
noble
and
joyous
in
it
and
with
its
abysses
of
sin
and
misery
enacted
at
all
it
is
only
a
partial
answer
that
one
can
hope
to
give
to
this
grave
inquiry
for
the
designs
of
providence
can
not
be
fully
fathomed
but
among
the
ends
in
view
the
moral
training
of
mankind
stands
forth
with
a
marked
prominence
the
deliverance
of
the
race
from
moral
evil
and
error
and
the
of
a
purified
society
enriched
with
all
the
good
that
belongs
to
the
ideal
of
humanity
and
exalted
by
fellowship
with
god
is
not
only
an
end
worthy
in
itself
but
it
is
the
end
towards
which
the
onward
movement
of
history
is
seen
to
be
directed
hence
a
central
place
in
the
course
of
history
belongs
to
the
life
and
work
of
jesus
christ
no
more
satisfactory
solution
of
this
problem
of
the
significance
of
history
has
ever
been
offered
than
that
brought
forward
by
the
apostle
paul
in
acts
xvii
where
he
says
that
the
nations
of
men
were
assigned
to
their
places
on
the
earth
and
their
duration
as
well
as
boundaries
determined
that
they
should

the

the
form
of

of
kings
or
bare
records
of

or
the
simple
registration
of

occurrences
of

the
egyptians

furnish
examples
of
this
rudimental
type
of
historical

more
continuous
annals
followed
but
these
are
meager
in
contents
and
make
no
attempt
to
find
links
of
connection
between

the
ancient
hebrew
historians
are
on
a
much
higher
plane
and
apart
from
their
religious
value
far
surpass
all
other
asiatic
histories
it
was
in
the
of
science
that
history
as
an
art
first
appeared
born
early
in
the
fifth
century
first
undertook
to
satisfy
curiosity
respecting
the
past
by
a
more
elaborate
and
entertaining
narrative
he
begins
his
work
thus
these
are
the
researches
of
herodotus
of
halicarnassus
which
he
publishes
in
the
hope
of
thereby
preserving
from
decay
the
remembrance
of
what
men
have
done
and
of
preventing
the
great
and
marvelous
actions
of
the
greeks
and
the
barbarians
from
losing
their
due
meed
of
glory
and
withal
to
put
on
record
what
were
the
grounds
of
their
hostility
in
herodotus
history
owing
to
the
inquiry
made
into
the
causes
of
events
begins
to
rise
above
the
level
of
a
mere
chronicle
its
primitive
type
who
died
about
followed
he
is
far
more
accurate
in
his
investigations
having
a
deep
insight
into
the
origin
of
the
events
which
he
relates
and
is
a
model
of
candor
he
too
writes
to
minister
to
the
inquisitive
spirit
of
his
countrymen
and
of
the
generations
that
were
to
follow
he
began
to
write
his
history
of
the
war
between
the
athenians
and
the
peloponnesians
while
it
was
still
going
on
in
the
belief
he
says
that
it
would
turn
out
great
and
worthier
of
being
recorded
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
the
attention
of
historical
writers
was
still
confined
to
a
particular
country
or
to
insulated
groups
of
events
before
there
could
spring
up
the
idea
of
universal
history
it
was
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
broader
view
of
mankind
as
a
whole
the
ancient
had
a
glimpse
of
the
race
as
a
family
and
of
the
nations
as
forming
one
complex
unity
the
conquests
and
extended
dominion
of
rome
first
suggested
the
idea
of
universal
history
a
greek
in
the
second
century
had
watched
the
progress
of
rome
in
its
career
of
conquest
until
the
affairs
of
italy
and
africa
as
he
says
joined
with
those
of
asia
and
greece
and
all
moved
together
towards
one
fixed
and
single
point
he
tells
us
that
particular
histories
can
not
give
us
a
knowledge
of
the
whole
more
than
the
survey
of
the
divided
members
of
a
body
once
endowed
with
life
and
beauty
can
yield
a
just
conception
of
all
the
comeliness
and
vigor
which
it
has
received
from
nature
to
polybius
belongs
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
to
undertake
a
universal
history
christianity
with
its
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
mankind
and
with
all
the
moral
and
religious
teaching
characteristic
of
the
gospel
contributed
effectively
to
the
widening
of
the
view
of
the
office
and
scope
of
history
it
is
only
in
quite
recent
times
that
history
has
directed
its
attention
predominantly
to
and
to
its
causes
and
conditions
history
in
its
etymological
sense
from
the
greek
historia
meant
the
ascertaining
of
facts
by
inquiry
then
the
results
of
this
inquiry
the
knowledge
thus
obtained
the
work
of
herodotus
was
history
in
the
strictest
sense
he
acquired
his
information
by
travel
and
personal
interrogation
the
german
philosopher
has
divided
histories
into
three
classes
works
written
by
contemporaries
of
the
events
described
who
share
in
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
may
have
personally
taken
part
in
the
transactions
such
are
the
works
of
herodotus
thucydides
xenophon
anabasis
clarendon
history
of
the
great
rebellion
in
england
caesar
commentaries
where
the
author
writes
at
a
later
point
of
time
on
the
basis
of
materials
which
he
gathers
up
but
is
not
himself
a
partaker
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
of
which
he
treats
which
set
forth
the
rational
development
of
history
in
its
inmost
idea
another
classification
is
the
following
like
the
records
of
manetho
the
egyptian
priest
following
the
chronological
order
and
telling
the
story
in
a
simple
popular
way
pragmatic
form
of
writing
which
aims
to
explain
by
reference
to
the
past
some
particular
characteristic
or
phase
of
the
present
and
uses
history
to
point
a
special
moral
lesson
the
form
of
history
which
traces
the
rise
and
progress
of
tendencies
or
ruling
forces
such
as
the
idea
of
civil
equality
in
early
rome
or
in
modern
france
the
religious
ideas
of
mohammedanism
the
idea
of
representative
government
the
idea
of
german
unity
etc
a
broad
line
of
distinction
has
been
drawn
between
the
old
or
type
of
history
and
the
new
or
type
which
belongs
to
the
present
century
the
ancient
historians
represented
the
former
type
they
prized
literary
form
they
aimed
to
interweave
moral
and
political
reflections
polybius
often
interrupts
his
narrative
to
introduce
remarks
of
this
sort
but
they
were
not
as
a
rule
diligent
and
accurate
in
their
researches
and
above
all
they
had
no
just
conception
of
society
as
a
whole
and
of
the
complex
forces
out
of
which
the
visible
scene
springs
the
greeks
were
the
masters
in
this
first
or
artistic
form
of
history
the
french
revolution
was
one
stimulus
to
a
profounder
and
more
comprehensive
method
of
studying
history
the
methods
and
investigations
of
natural
science
have
had
a
decided
influence
in
the
same
direction
the
sources
of
history
must
depend
for
credence
on
credible
evidence
in
order
to
justify
belief
one
must
either
himself
have
seen
or
heard
the
facts
related
or
have
the
testimony
direct
or
indirect
of
witnesses
or
of
contemporaries
the
sources
of
historic
knowledge
are
mainly
comprised
in
or
in
some
form
of
is
exposed
to
the
infirmities
of
memory
and
to
the
unconscious
invention
and
distortion
which
grow
out
of
imagination
and
feeling
ordinarily
bare
tradition
not
verified
by
corroborative
proofs
can
not
be
trusted
later
than
the
second
generation
from
the
circumstances
narrated
it
ceases
to
be
reliable
when
it
has
been
transmitted
through
more
than
two
hands
in
the
case
of
a
great
and
startling
event
like
a
destructive
convulsion
of
nature
or
a
protracted
war
the
authentic
story
though
unwritten
of
the
central
facts
at
least
is
of
much
longer
duration
there
may
be
visible
monuments
that
serve
to
perpetuate
the
recollection
of
the
occurrences
which
they
commemorate
may
exist
popular
festivals
and
the
like
which
keep
alive
the
memory
of
past
events
and
in
certain
circumstances
are
sufficient
to
verify
them
to
generations
far
removed
in
time
events
of
a
stirring
character
when
they
are
embodied
in
of
an
early
date
may
be
transmitted
orally
though
in
a
poetic
dress
songs
and
legends
it
may
be
added
even
when
they
do
not
suffice
to
verify
the
incidents
to
which
they
refer
are
valuable
as
disclosing
the
sentiments
and
habits
of
the
times
when
they
originated
or
were
cherished
the
central
fact
the
nucleus
of
the
tradition
may
be
historical
when
all
the
details
belonging
with
it
have
been
effaced
or
have
been
superseded
by
other
details
the
product
of
imagination
the
historical
student
is
to
distinguish
between
traditionary
tales
which
are
and
traditions
which
have
roots
in
apart
from
oral
tradition
the
sources
of
historical
knowledge
are
the
following
contemporary
registers
chronicles
and
other
documents
either
now
or
known
to
have
been
originally
in
a
manuscript
form
inscriptions
on
monuments
and
coins
such
for
example
are
the
inscriptions
on
the
monuments
of
egypt
and
on
the
buried
ruins
of
nineveh
and
babylon
such
are
the
ancient
epitaphs
heathen
and
christian
in
the
roman
catacombs
the
study
of
ancient
inscriptions
of
various
sorts
has
thrown
much
light
of
late
upon
grecian
and
roman
antiquity
the
entire
literature
of
a
people
in
which
its
intellectual
moral
and
social
condition
at
any
particular
era
is
mirrored
material
structures
of
every
kind
as
altars
tombs
private
dwellings
as
those
uncovered
at
pompeii
public
edifices
civil
and
religious
paintings
weapons
household
utensils
these
all
tell
a
story
relative
to
the
knowledge
and
taste
the
occupations
and
domestic
habits
and
the
religion
of
a
past
generation
or
of
an
extinct
people
language
is
a
memorial
of
the
past
of
the
more
value
since
it
is
not
the
product
of
deliberate
contrivance
following
languages
back
to
their
earlier
stages
and
to
the
parent
stocks
unveils
the
condition
of
society
at
remote
epochs
it
not
only
describes
the
origin
of
nations
but
teaches
something
respecting
their
primitive
state
histories
written
at
former
periods
but
subsequently
to
the
events
described
in
them
are
a
secondary
but
valuable
source
of
historical
knowledge
this
is
especially
true
when
their
authors
had
access
to
traditions
that
were
nearer
their
fountain
or
to
literary
monuments
which
have
perished
historical
historical
scholars
are
much
more
exacting
as
regards
evidence
than
was
formerly
the
case
the
criticism
of
what
purports
to
be
proof
is
more
searching
at
the
same
time
what
is
called
historical
divination
can
not
be
altogether
excluded
learned
and
sagacious
scholars
have
conjectured
the
existence
of
facts
where
a
gap
in
recorded
history
the
logic
of
events
seemed
to
presuppose
them
and
later
discoveries
have
verified
the
guess
this
is
analogous
to
the
success
of
leverrier
and
adams
in
inferring
the
existence
of
an
unknown
planet
which
the
telescope
afterwards
discovered
an
example
of
historical
divination
on
a
large
scale
is
furnished
by
the
theories
of
the
great
german
historian
in
respect
to
early
roman
history
he
propounded
opinions
however
which
in
many
particulars
fail
to
obtain
general
assent
at
present
credibility
of
at
the
opposite
pole
from
credulity
is
an
unwarrantable
historical
skepticism
the
story
is
told
of
sir
walter
raleigh
that
when
he
was
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
and
was
engaged
in
writing
his
of
the
he
heard
the
sounds
of
a
fracas
in
the
on
inquiry
of
those
who
were
concerned
in
it
and
were
on
the
spot
he
found
so
many
contradictions
in
their
statements
that
he
could
not
get
at
the
truth
whereupon
it
occurred
to
him
as
a
vain
thing
to
undertake
to
describe
what
had
occurred
on
the
vast
theater
of
the
world
when
he
could
not
ascertain
the
truth
about
an
event
occurring
within
a
the
anecdote
simply
illustrates
however
the
difficulty
of
getting
at
the
exact
truth
respecting
details
a
difficulty
constantly
exemplified
in
courts
of
justice
the
fact
of
the
conflict
in
the
court
of
the
tower
the
general
cause
the
parties
engaged
the
consequences
as
for
example
what
punishment
was
inflicted
were
undisputed
the
great
facts
which
influence
the
course
of
history
it
is
not
difficult
to
ascertain
moreover
as
against
an
extravagant
skepticism
it
may
be
said
that
history
provides
us
with
a
vast
amount
of
authentic
information
which
contemporaries
and
even
individual
actors
were
not
possessed
of
this
is
through
the
bringing
to
light
of
documents
from
a
great
variety
of
sources
many
of
which
were
secret
or
not
open
to

put
us
in

of
much
information
which
at
the
time
was
a
secret
to
most
of
the
prominent
participants
in
the

numerous

classification
the

represented

the

the

the

in

the
extremes
of
form
and
color
are
certainly
separated
but
without
regard
to
the
races
which
can
not
be
included
in
any
of
these
classes

for

zo√∂logists
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
own
science
now
more
generally
favor
the
doctrine
which
traces
mankind
to
a
single
pair
than
the
polygenist
which
assumed
different
centers
of
origin
the
present
tendencies
of
natural
science
especially
since
darwin
are
favorable
to
the
monogenist
view
the
opinion
of
modern
zo√∂logists
whose
study
of
the
species
and
breeds
of
animals
makes
them
the
best
judges
is
against
this
view
of
the
several
origins
of
man
for
two
principal
reasons
first
that
all
tribes
of
men
from
the
blackest
to
the
whitest
the
most
savage
to
the
most
cultured
have
such
general
likeness
in
the
structure
of
their
bodies
and
the
working
of
their
minds
as
is
easiest
and
best
accounted
for
by
their
being
descended
from
a
common
ancestry
however
distant
second
that
all
the
human
races
notwithstanding
their
form
and
color
appear
capable
of
freely
intermarrying
and
forming
crossed
races
of
every
combination
such
as
the
millions
of
mulattoes
and
mestizoes
sprung
in
the
new
world
from
the
mixture
of
europeans
africans
and
native
americans
this
again
points
to
a
common
ancestry
of
all
the
races
of
man
we
may
accept
the
theory
of
the

of
the

of

and
the
formation
of
the
various
nationalities
by
these
races
through
conquest
and
intermixture
following
the
divisions
of
linguistic
science
we
should
have
first
the
race
and
their
history
then
we
should
have
the
race
in
the
three
eras
of
their
and
in
their
various
branches
then
would
come
the
or
family
whose
power
except
when
interrupted
and
partially
broken
by
the
mohammedan
conquests
has
continued
to
dominate
in
history
since
the
rise
of
the
ancient
persian
empire
there
have
been
three
periods
of
semitic
ascendency
the
era
of
the
assyrian
and
babylonian
empires
that
of
the
phoenician
cities
and
of
carthage
a
tyrian
settlement
with
their

and
that
of
the

this
last
epoch
falls
within
the
christian
era
in
this
course
of
semitic
history
would
be
embraced
the
narrative
of
the
israelites
and
of
their
dispersion
in
ancient
and
in
modern
times
the
or
aryan
family
follows
next
in
order
in
recording
its
history
we
should
consider
first
its
oldest
representative
of
which
we
have
knowledge
the
indian
race
with
its
literature
its
social
organization
and
its
religions
brahmanism
and
buddhism
then
come
the
persians
with
their
religion
founded
by
and
the
armenians
with
the
fall
of
the
ancient
persian
empire
the
center
of
power
was
transferred
from
asia
to
europe
where
it
has
since
continued
though
still
in
the
hands
of
the
same
aryan
race
the
history
of
the
greeks
and
of
the
romans
succeeds
then
the
history
of
the
three
races
the
celtic
teutonic
and
slavonian
as
they
present
themselves
at
the
threshold
of
authentic
history
the
forming
of
the
several
nationalities
of
europe
would
have
to
be
traced
the
slavonian
including
russia
and
poland
the
teutonic
comprising
england
holland
germany
and
the
scandinavian
peoples
denmark
sweden
norway
and
iceland
the
romanic
or
italic
nations
portugal
spain
provence
italy
wallachia
the
grisons
of
switzerland
which
are
the
nations
the
basis
of
whose
languages
is
the
rustic
or
people
latin
of
the
middle
ages
such
in
brief
outline
is
the
method
which
history
from
the
point
of
view
of
race
affinities
as
these
are
indicated
by
language
would
adopt
unity
of
whether
mankind
are
all
descended
from
one
pair
the
view
or
spring
from
more
than
one
center
of
origin
the
view
is
a
question
which
philological
science
can
not
answer
the
facts
of
language
are
reconcilable
with
either
doctrine
while
cautious
philologists
are
slow
in
admitting
distinct
affinities
between
the
generic
families
of
speech
as
the
semitic
and
which
would
be
indicative
of
a
common
origin
they
agree
in
the
judgment
that
on
account
of
the
mutability
of
language
especially
when
unwritten
and
while
in
its
earlier
stages
no
conclusion
adverse
to
the
monogenist
doctrine
can
be
drawn
from
the
diversities
of
speech
now
existing
or
that
are
known
to
have
existed
at
any
past
time
as
far
as
science
is
concerned
the
decision
of
the
question
must
be
left
to
zo√∂logy
the
tendencies
of
natural
science
at
present
as
we
have
said
above
are
strongly
toward
the
monogenist
view
the
variety
of
physical
characteristics
not
only
affords
no
warrant
for
assuming
diversity
of
species
among
men
they
do
not
even
imply
diversity
of
parentage
at
the
beginning
nothing
says
max
m√ºller
necessitates
the
admission
of
different
independent
beginnings
for
the
elements
the
vocabulary
of
the
turanian
semitic
and
aryan
branches
of
speech
the
same
thing
m√ºller
affirms
of
the
formal
elements
the
grammatical
structure
of
these
groups
of
languages
we
can
perfectly
understand
how
either
through
individual
influences
or
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
speech
in
its
continuous
working
the
different
systems
of
grammar
of
asia
and
europe
may
have
been
produced
on
series
p
the
same
conclusions
are
reached
by
professor
whitney
who
while
disclaiming
for
linguistic
science
the
power
to
prove
that
the
human
race
in
the
beginning
formed
one
society
says
that
it
is
even
far
more
demonstrable
that
it
can
never
prove
the
variety
of
human
races
and
origins
and
growth
of
p
we
know
that
nations
can
learn
and
unlearn
a
language
the
irish
adopting
the
language
of
their
english
conquerors
is
one
of
many
examples
of
the
same
sort
in
history
what
effects
upon
language
took
place
prior
to
recorded
history
from
the
mingling
of
tribes
and
peoples
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
the
consequences
to
language
of
mixture
among
different
forms
of
speech
were
like
those
which
must
have
been
produced
upon
the
physical
man
from
the
mingling
of
diverse
physical
types
in
remote
ages
science
if
it
has
no
decided
verdict
to
render
does
not
stand
in
conflict
with
the
monogenist
doctrine
which
has
generally
been
understood
to
be
the
teaching
of
the
scriptures
mythology
the
polytheistic
religions
are
in
themselves
a
highly
interesting
part
of
the
history
of
mankind
in
the
multiform
character
that
belongs
to
them
we
find
reflected
the
peculiar
traits
of
the
several
peoples
among
whom
they
have
arisen
the
history
of
religion
stands
in
a
close
connection
with
the
development
of
the
fine
arts
architecture
and
sculpture
painting
music
and
also
poetry
the
earliest
rhythmical
utterance
was
in
hymns
to
the
gods
to
worship
all
the
arts
are
largely
indebted
for
their
birth
and
growth
this
however
is
only
one
of
the
ways
in
which
religion
is
interwoven
with
the
rise
and
progress
of
civilization
by
we
mean
the
collective
beliefs
of
any
tribe
or
nation
respecting
deities
or
personages
recent
studies
in
language
or
the
science
of
have
thrown
light
on
the
origin
of
mythology
and
upon
the
affinities
of
different
polytheistic
religions
with
one
another
among
various
nations
belonging
to
the
same
family
as
for
example
the
peoples
of
the
race
names
of
gods
and
to
some
extent
qualities
and
deeds
attributed
to
them
have
been
identified
myths
are
found
to
have
traveled
in
different
guises
from
land
to
land
at
the
same
time
these
discoveries
have
given
rise
to
much
unverified
theory
and
conjecture
too
much
stress
has
been
laid
by
certain
writers
on
in
as
a
source
of
mythology
in
the
primitive
stage
of
language
all
nouns
had
a
either
male
or
female
and
verbs
even
auxiliary
verbs
it
is
alleged
expressed
of
some
sort
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
it
has
been
inferred
that
at
a
later
day
figurative
expressions
descriptive
of
natural
changes
were
taken
as
literal
as
if
one
should
interpret
the
saying
the
sun
follows
the
dawn
as
meaning
that
one
person
pursues
another
by
this
kind
of
misunderstanding
it
has
been
thought
a
throng
of
mythological
tales
arose
by
some
it
is
held
that
the
names
of
animals
which
had
been
given
to
ancestors
were
interpreted
literally
by
their
savage
descendants
or
that
traditions
of
having
come
from
a
certain
or
caused
these
natural
objects
to
be
mistakenly
regarded
as
actual
progenitors
these
suggestions
are
of
very
limited
value
in
solving
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
the
ethnic
religions
much
however
has
been
learned
from
observing
the
rites
and
beliefs
of
existing
savage
nations
not
a
few
religious
notions
and
ceremonies
once
in
vogue
among
cultivated
heathen
peoples
may
be
plausibly
considered
a
survival
from
a
more
remote
and
barbarous
condition
of
society
that
mythology
is
the
product
of
a
mere
exaggeration
of
actual
events
or
is
an
allegorical
picture
either
of
the
operations
of
nature
or
of
human
traits
is
an
untenable
and
obsolete
view
we
shall
not
err
in
defining
the
main
sources
of
the
religions
to
be
the
sense
of
dependence
and
the
yearning
for
the
fellowship
and
favor
of
powers
not
ourselves
by
which
the
lot
of
men
is
felt
to
be
determined
the
effort
to
explain
the
world
of
nature
above
and
beneath
and
the
occurrences
of
life
and
the
personifying
instinct
which
belongs
to
the
childhood
of
nations
as
of
individuals
this
tendency
leads
to
the
attributing
of
conscious
life
to
things
inanimate
a
like
tendency
may
impel
the
savage
and
the
child
to
ascribe
mind
to
the
lower
animals
the
fact
that
language
in
its
earlier
stage
was
charged
with
personal
life
and
activity
is
itself
the
work
of
the
personifying
instinct
when
nature
is
thus
personified
where
there
is
no
sense
of
its
unity
and
no
capacity
to
rise
in
faith
to
a
living
god
above
nature
the
result
is
a
multitude
of
divinities
of
higher
and
lower
rank
respecting
them
are
the
spontaneous
invention
of
unreflecting
and
uncritical
but
imaginative
peoples
thus
they
serve
to
indicate
the
range
of
ideas
and
the
moral
spirit
of
those
who
originate
and
give
credence
to
them
this
is
not
the
place
to
consider
the
question
what
was
the
primitive
religion
of
man
the
earliest
deities
that
history
brings
to
our
notice
were
not
fetiches
but
heavenly
beings
of
lofty
attributes
whether
the
religions
of
savage
tribes
in
common
with
their
low
grade
of
intelligence
are
or
are
not
the
result
of
is
a
question
which
secular
history
affords
no
means
of
deciding
with
confidence
it
may
be
added
that
in
historic
eras
the
mythopoeic
fancy
is
not
inactive
stories
of
marvelous
adventure
clustered
about
the
old
celtic
king
arthur
of
england
and
the
knights
of
the
and
fill
up
the
chronicles
relating
to
charlemagne
wherever
there
is
a
person
who
kindles
popular
enthusiasm
myths
accumulate
this
is
eminently
true
in
an
atmosphere
like
that
which
prevailed
in
the
mediaeval
period
when
imagination
and
emotion
were
dominant
prehistoric
times
prehistoric
within
the
last
half
century
in
various
countries
of
europe
and
in
other
countries
also
which
have
been
earlier
or
later
seats
of
civilization
there
have
been
found
numerous
relics
of
uncivilized
races
which
at
periods
far
remote
must
have
inhabited
the
same
ground
many
of
these
antiquities
are
met
with
in
connection
with
remains
of
fossil
elephants
hyenas
bears
with
animals
which
no
longer
live
in
the
regions
referred
to
and
some
of
which
have
become
wholly
extinct
of
these
peoples
such
as
caves
and
and
the
remains
of
the
that
were
built
on
piles
in
switzerland
and
elsewhere
sepulchers
camps
and
forts
and
an
immense
number
of
implements
and
ornaments
of
stone
and
metal
have
been
examined
the
most
ancient
of
these
monuments
carry
us
as
far
back
as
the
era
called
by
geologists
the
or
period
the
three
but
there
are
marked
distinctions
in
the
relative
age
of
the
various
relics
referred
to
they
indicate
different
degrees
of
knowledge
and
skill
and
this
proof
of
a
succession
of
peoples
or
of
stages
of
development
is
confirmed
by
geological
evidence
the
prehistoric
time
is
divided
into
stone
age
of
and
age
of
according
as
the
implements
in
use
were
of
one
or
another
of
these
materials
but
the
stone
age
includes
an
and
a
in
the
first
and
most
ancient
section
the
weapons
and
utensils
mostly
of
flint
were
very
rude
in
their
manufacture
this
was
the
where
there
are
no
signs
of
habitations
constructed
by
the
hand
or
of
domesticated
plants
and
animals
men
lived
in
caves
and
their
vestments
were
the
skins
of
beasts
yet
among
their
implements
are
found
fragments
of
bone
horn
ivory
and
stone
on
which
are
carved
in
outline
often
with
much
skill
representations
of
the
reindeer
the
bear
the
ox
and
of
other
animals
in
the
period
there
was
a
decided
advance
implements
are
better
made
and
polished
there
were
domestic
animals
and
cultivated
plants
the
in
switzerland
were
well
contrived
for
shelter
and
defense
every
hut
had
its
hearth
it
is
probable
that
most
of
them
were
furnished
with
a
loom
for
weaving
fragments
of
pottery
are
found
and
flax
was
grown
and
made
into
cord
nettings
etc
stalls
were
constructed
near
the
huts
for
the
ox
the
goat
the
horse
sheep
and
pigs
the
cultivated
wheat
and
barley
the
when
implements
were
made
of
copper
or
of
a
mixture
of
copper
and
tin
exhibits
proof
of
decided
improvement
in
various
directions
and
the
of
a
still
more
marked
advance
in
the
swiss
remains
referred
to
are
distinct
traces
of
a
transition
from
the
stone
age
to
the
age
of
bronze
and
then
to
the
age
of
iron
the
or
of
denmark
belong
exclusively
to
the
neolithic
period
where
the
transition
was
made
from
the
stone
age
to
the
age
of
bronze
it
apparently
occurred
in
some
cases
by
degrees
and
peacefully
but
sometimes
by
the
incoming
of
an
invading
people
more
advanced
it
should
be
observed
that
the
lines
of
division
between
these
periods
are
not
sharply
drawn
implements
of
stone
continued
to
be
used
after
the
bronze
and
even
the
iron
periods
had
been
introduced
nor
were
these
several
ages
in
one
region
contemporaneous
with
like
conditions
in
every
other
moreover
it
is
not
possible
to
find
in
all
countries
once
civilized
proofs
of
a
passage
through
these
successive
eras
in
egypt
the
evidences
of
a
stone
age
are
scanty
the
most
ancient
human
remains
show
that
man
in
his
physical
characteristics
was
on
a
level
with
man
at
present
daniel
speaking
of
the
age
of

it
is
of
no
slight
importance
to
perceive
that
the
interval
which
has
wrought
such
revolutions
in
the
earth
involving
great
geological
changes
and
mutations
of
climate
as
are
recorded
in

to

longer

to
little

however
if
the
phenomena
described
in

have
failed
to
leave
the
impression
upon
the
reader
that
the
advent
of
neolithic
man
in
europe
must
date
back
far
beyond
fifty
or
seventy
centuries
p
the
chronology
gathered
from

has
been
supposed
to
place
the
date
of

at

at
the

belongs

it
may
be
observed
here
however
that
of
the
three
forms
in
which
genesis
is
handed
down
to
us
the
hebrew

the

pentateuch
and

the
estimate
is

hence
hales
and
jackson
following
the
larger
numbers
in
the
genealogies
of
the
septuagint
place
the
date
of
the
creation
at
a
point
about
fourteen
hundred
years
prior
to
that
fixed
upon
by

ancient
and
modern
history
the
periods
of
history
are
not
divided
from
one
another
by
merely
chronological
limits
according
to
intervals
of
time
of
a
definite
duration
such
a
classification
may
be
of
use
to
the
memory
but
it
is
arbitrary
in
its
character
the
landmarks
of
history
are
properly
placed
at
the
where
new
eras
take
their
start
whether
the
intervals
between
them
are
longer
or
shorter
of
these
natural
divisions
the
most
general
and
the
most
marked
is
that
between
ancient
and
modern
history
ancient
history
not
only
precedes
modern
in
time
it
is
distinguished
from
the
latter
as
relating
to
a
state
of
things
modern
history
on
the
contrary
deals
with
an
order
of
things
now
existing
between
the
two
there
is
this
line
of
demarkation
history
with
the
exception
of
china
and
india
which
require
distinct
consideration
as
standing
apart
begins
with
egypt
and
flows
down
in
a
continuous
stream
until
in
the
fourth
century
the
roman
empire
into
which
the
ancient
civilized
peoples
were
incorporated
was
broken
up
then
the
new
nations
especially
the
tribes
of
the
germanic
race
took
power
into
their
hands
christianity
was
established
among
them
out
of
the
chaos
of
elements
there
emerged
the
european
nations
with
their
offshoots
the
peoples
at
present
on
the
stage
of
action
ancient
history
had
its
center
in
the
mediterranean
it
embraced
the
peoples
who
dwelt
on
the
shores
of
that
sea
in
the
three
continents
and
the
nations
that
were
brought
into
relations
with
them
the
roman
empire
the
final
outcome
of
ancient
history
was
the
monarchy
of
the
mediterranean
with
the
of
the
empire
new
races
new
centers
of
power
a
universal
religion
in
the
room
of
national
religions
and
a
new
type
of
culture
and
civilization
were
introduced
invaluable
legacies
were
handed
over
from
the
past
surviving
the
wreck
of
ancient
civilization
there
is
however
a
unity
in
history
the
transition
from
the
ancient
to
the
modern
era
was
gradual
mediaeval
and
later
modern
history
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
there
has
occurred
no
revolution
to
be
compared
with
the
circumstances
and
results
of
that
event
an
old
world
passed
away
and
a
new
world
began
to
be
yet
the
student
as
he
travels
hitherward
arrives
at
another
epoch
of
extraordinary
change
a
period
of
ferment
when
modern

in
europe
takes
on
a
form
widely
different
from
the

that
had
belonged
to
it
previously

long

and
in

more
restricted

followed
in

after
a
long
life
died
in
one
of
his
doctrines
was
that
the
nature
of
man
is
good
and
that
evil
is
owing
to
education
and
circumstances
one
of
his
maxims
was
that
the
people
can
be
led
aright
but
can
not
be
taught
the
reasons
for
the
guidance
to
which
they
are
subjected
dynasty
of
tsin
reverting
to
the
course
of
chinese
history
the
next
grand
epoch
is
the
enthronement
of
the
tsin
dynasty
in
the
person
of
the
ruler
of
one
of
the
provinces
which
in
the
intestine
strife
among
the
feudal
princes
gained
the
victory
this
was
in
in
this
line
belongs
the
famous
emperor
who
in
at
the
age
of
thirteen
years
succeeded
to
the
crown
his
palace
in
his
capital
the
modern
foo
the
edifices
which
he
built
elsewhere
the
roads
and
canals
constructed
by
him
excited
wonder
he
routed
and
drove
out
the
tartar
invaders
and
put
down
the
rebellion
of
the
feudal
princes
he
enlarged
the
kingdom
nearly
to
the
limits
of
modern
china
proper
for
the
protection
of
the
northern
frontier
he
began
the
great
wall
which
he
did
not
live
to
finish
it
was
finished
ten
years
after
it
was
begun
when
finished
it
was
not
less
than
fifteen
hundred
miles
in
length
it
would
reach
from
philadelphia
to
topeka
or
from
portugal
to
naples
the
innovations
and
maxims
of
government
of
che
were
offensive
to
the
scholars
and
the
conservative
class
who
pointed
the
people
to
the
heroes
of
the
feudal
days
and
to
the
glories
of
the
past
for
this
reason
the
monarch
commanded
that
all
books
having
reference
to
the
history
of
the
empire
should
be
destroyed
he
would
efface
the
recollection
of
the
old
times
he
would
not
allow
his
system
to
be
undermined
by
tradition
the
decree
was
obeyed
although
hidden
copies
of
many
of
the
ancient
writings
were
undoubtedly
preserved
numerous
scholars
were
buried
alive
his
death
in
was
followed
by
disturbances
growing
out
of
the
disaffection
of
the
higher
classes
in
the
civil
war
that
ensued
his
dynasty
was
subverted
the
throne
was
next
held
by
the
han
rulers
their
sway
which
lasted
for
four
hundred
years
covers
a
brilliant
period
in
the
chinese
annals
during
the
reign
of
a
deputation
was
sent
to
india
to
obtain
the
sacred
writings
and
authorized
teachers
of
the
buddhistic
religion
which
had
begun
to
spread
among
the
chinese
the
power
of
the
feudal
lords
was
reduced
northern
corea
was
conquered
and
the
bounds
of
the
empire
extended
on
the
west
as
far
as
russian
turkestan
in
this
period
there
was
a
marked
revival
of
learning
and
authorship
then
lived
a
famous
public
officer
who
when
asked
to
take
a
bribe
and
assured
that
no
one
would
know
it
answered
how
so
heaven
would
know
earth
would
know
you
would
know
and
i
should
know
under
this
dynasty
a
custom
of
burying
slaves
with
the
dead
was
abolished
beginning
in
there
followed
the
era
of
the
three
kingdoms
it
was
an
age
of
martial
prowess
civil
war
and
bloodshed
this
long
period
of
division
was
interrupted
in
by
a
of
the
greater
part
of
the
empire
for
a
brief
period
but
discord
soon
sprang
up
and
it
was
not
until
that
unity
and
order
were
restored
by
who
founded
the
dynasty
named
from
his
local
dominion
religion
in
the
ancient
religion
of
china
was
polytheistic
the
supreme
divinity
was
called
or
tien
signifies
heaven
was
heaven
or
or
the
lord
the
visible
heaven
the
expanse
above
clothed
with
the
attribute
of
personality
this
has
been
and
still
is
the
prevailing
opinion
of
missionaries
and
scholars
however
holds
that
tien
is
the
lord
of
the
heavens
a
power
above
the
visible
firmament
and
thus
finds
monotheism
as
the
basis
of
the
chinese
religious
creed
the
prevailing
religions
of
china
are
three
which
in
its
original
form
was
brought
in
from
india
in
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
and
it
may
be
observed
that
in
all
these
systems
there
is
but
a
vague
sense
of
personality
as
inhering
in
the
heavenly
powers
in
comparison
with
the
creeds
in
vogue
among
heathen
nations
generally
another
fact
to
be
noted
is
that
in
chinese
worship
the
veneration
for
ancestors
a
feeling
inbred
in
the
chinese
mind
is
a
very
prominent
and
pervading
element
confucius
did
not
profess
to
reveal
things
supernatural
his
teaching
is
made
up
of
moral
and
political
maxims
he
builds
on
the
past
and
always
inculcates
reverence
for
the
fathers
and
for
what
has
been
there
is
much
wise
counsel
to
parents
and
to
rulers
his
morality
reaches
its
acme
in
the
golden
rule
which
he
gives
however
only
in
its
negative
relation
do
not
unto
others
what
you
would
not
that
others
should
do
unto
you
is
a
more
speculative
and
mystical
thinker
in
his
moral
aphorisms
he
approaches
the
theory
of
the
ancient
stoics
teh
virtue
is
lauded
teh
proceeds
from
tao
to
explain
what
the
chinese
sage
means
by
tao
a
word
that
signifies
the
way
is
a
puzzle
for
commentators
and
inquirers
from
tao
all
things
originate
they
conform
to
tao
and
to
tao
they
return
there
are
noble
maxims
in
precepts
enjoining
compassion
and
condemning
the
requital
of
evil
with
evil
taouism
is
a
type
of
religion
which
traces
itself
to
the
teaching
of
that
teaching
became
mixed
with
wild
speculations
then
certain
buddhistic
rites
and
tenets
were
added
to
it
the
result
finally
was
a
compound
of
knavery
and
superstition
taouism
is
at
once
mystical
and
rationalistic
in
its
tone
literature
in
the
chinese
language
was
crystallized
in
the
written
form
in
the
monosyllabic
stage
of
its
development
beginning
in
hieroglyphs
literal
pictures
of
objects
and
having
no
alphabet
it
has
so
multiplied
its
characters
and
combinations
of
characters
as
to
put
great
hindrances
in
the
way
of
the
acquisition
of
it
the
utter
absence
of
inflection
may
have
crippled
the
development
of
poetry
and
of
the
drama
for
which
the
chinese
have
a
natural
taste
in
these
departments
chinese
productions
do
not
rise
above
mediocrity
for
this
however
the
lack
of
imagination
and
of
creative
power
is
largely
accountable
it
is
in
the
province
of
pure
prose
as
in
historical
narrations
topographical
writings
such
as
geographies
and
in
the
making
of
encyclopedias
that
the
chinese
have
excelled
but
the
yoke
of
tradition
has
everywhere
weighed
heavily
in
one
sense
the
chinese
have
been
a
literary
people
the
system
of
competitive
examinations
for
public
offices
has
diffused
through
the
nation
a
certain
degree
of
yet
the
masses
have
been
kept
in
a
state
of
ignorance
at
the
foundation
of
all
learning
are
the
nine
classics
which
consist
of
five
works
edited
or
written
by
confucius
of
which
the
shoo
king
or
book
of
history
stands
at
the
head
together
with
the
four
books
written
by
his
disciples
and
the
disciples
of
mencius
great
as
have
been
the
services
of
confucius
his
own
slavish
reverence
for
the
past
so
stamped
upon
his
writings
has
had
the
effect
to
cramp
the
development
of
the
chinese
mind
and
to
fasten
upon
it
the
fetters
of
tradition
government
and
the
government
of
china
is
a
patriarchal
despotism
as
father
of
his
people
the
king
has
absolute
authority
the
power
of
life
and
death
is
in
his

yet
the
right
of
revolution
was
taught
by
confucius
and
mencius
and
the
chinese
have
not
been
slow
to
exercise
it

others
were
forgotten
there
is
sometimes
a
tendency
to
regard
them
as
all

under
different
names

this
tendency
develops
itself

it
is
an
expression
of
gratitude
and
dependence
it
has
moreover
a
deep
mysterious
energy
of
an
almost
magical
character
the
aryans
on
the
later
but
earlier
than
we
find
that
the
aryan
invaders
have
moved
onward
in
their
career
of
conquest
and
have
planted
themselves
on
the
plains
of
the
ganges
a
marvelous
transformation
has
taken
place
in
their
social
constitution
their
religion
and
in
their
general
spirit
the
caste
system
has
sprung
up
of
which
there
are
few
traces
in
the
in
the
first
or
lowest
of
these
distinct
classes
are
the
or
despised
serfs
who
are
the
subjugated
aborigines
the
second
or
next
higher
class
is
composed
of
the
tillers
of
the
soil
who
are
of
a
lower
rank
than
the
third
the
warrior
caste
these
in
turn
fall
below
the
or
priests
who
as
rites
of
worship
grew
more
complicated
and
superstition
increased
gained
though
not
without
a
struggle
a
complete
ascendency
this
marks
the
beginning
of
the
sacerdotal
era
the
tendency
of
the
farmer
caste
was
to
decrease
until
in
modern
times
in
various
provinces
they
are
hardly
found
the
supremacy
of
the
brahmans
was
largely
owing
to
their
eminence
as
the
great
literary
caste
they
arose
out
of
the
families
by
whom
the
hymns
had
been
composed
and
who
managed
the
tribal
sacrifices
they
alone
understood
the
language
of
the
hymns
and
the
ritual
in
the
earliest
veda
signifies
a
worshiper
brahminical
the
polytheism
of
the
earlier
type
of
religion
was
converted
into
pantheism
the
supreme
being
is
impersonal
the
eternal
source
of
all
things
from
which
all
finite
beings
gods
nature
and
men
emanate
it
is
by
an
outflow
analogous
to
that
of
a
stream
from
its
fountain
in
distinction
from
implying
will
and
that
all
derived
existences
emerge
into
being
with
this
doctrine
was
connected
the
belief
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
all
animated
beings
including
plants
as
well
as
animals
partake
of
the
universal
life
which
has
its
origin
and
seat
in
brahma
alienation
from
brahma
finite
individual
being
is
evil
to
work
the
way
back
to
brahma
is
the
great
aim
and
hope
absorption
in
brahma
return
to
the
primeval
essence
is
the
supreme
good
the
sufferings
of
the
present
are
the
penalty
of
sins
committed
in
a
state
if
they
are
not
purged
away
the
soul
is
condemned
to
be
embodied
again
and
again
it
may
be
in
some
repulsive
animal
this
process
of
metempsychosis
might
be
repeated
far
into
the
indefinite
future
with
the
doctrine
of
brahma
and
of
transmigration
was
connected
the
feeling
that
all
life
is
sacred
the
brahman
spared
even
trees
and
plants
from
destruction
pollution
or
defilement
might
be
contracted
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
there
grew
out
of
these
ideas
of
sin
rigorous
penances
most
painful
forms
of
it
was
only
by
practices
of
this
sort
that
there
was
hope
of
avoiding
the
retribution
so
much
dreaded
the
brahminical
the
principal
of
these
codes
is
the
of
manu
was
imagined
to
be
the
first
human
being
conceived
of
as
a
sage
this
code
is
a
digest
compiled
by
the
priests
at
a
date
unknown
but
comprising
in
it
materials
of
a
very
high
antiquity
hence
while
exhibiting
brahmanism
in
its
maturer
form
it
affords
glimpses
of
society
at
a
much
earlier
date
a
second
code
was
compiled
not
earlier
than
the
second
century
these
codes
present
hindu
law
under
three
heads
domestic
and
civil
rights
and
duties
the
administration
of
justice
purification
and
penance
in
truth
the
codes
prescribe
regulations
for
every
department
of
life
the
obligations
of
kings
of
brahmans
and
of
every
other
class
are
defined
in
detail
one
motive
that
is
kept
in
view
is
to
set
forth
and
fortify
the
special
privileges
of
the
brahminical
order
the
philosophy
of
the
in
process
of
time
commentaries
on
the
vedas
were
multiplied
discord
arose
in
the
interpretation
of
the
sacred
books
out
of
this
debate
and
confusion
there
emerged
in
the
seventh
and
sixth
centuries
several
philosophical
systems
these
aimed
to
give
peace
to
the
soul
by
emancipating
it
from
the
bondage
of
matter
and
by
imparting
a
sense
of
independence
of
the
body
and
of
the
external
world
these
old
philosophies
are
preserved
in
the
or
instructions
the
main
idea
in
these
diverse
systems
the
the
is
that
the
soul
notion
of
itself
as
separate
from
the
supreme
impersonal
being
is
the
fallen
state
this
duality
must
be
overcome
conscious
of
its
identity
with
the
supreme
the
soul
enters
into
or
the
state
of
unison
with
the
infinite
he
who
is
thus
taken
away
from
the
illusions
of
sense
or
the
is
free
from
the
power
of
things
perishable
death
brings
a
complete
absorption
into
the
source
of
all
being
it
is
the
bliss
of
personal
extinction
this
sort
of
philosophy
attached
great
value
to
contemplation
and
it
led
to
a
light
esteem
of
ritual
practices
and
ceremonies
buddhism
the
brahminical
system
has
not
ceased
to
maintain
its
supremacy
in
india
since
the
time
when
it
was
presented
to
view
in
the
but
it
has
not
escaped
alteration
and
attack
new
movements
religious
and
political
have
appeared
to
modify
its
character
of
these
buddhism
is
by
far
the
most
memorable
the
life
of
of
the
life
of
buddha
we
have
only
legendary
information
where
it
is
impossible
to
separate
fact
from
romance
the
date
of
his
death
was
between
and
he
was
then
old
he
belonged
to
the
family
of
gautamas
who
were
said
to
be
of
the
royal
line
of
the
√ß√¢kyas
a
clan
having
its
seat
about
a
hundred
and
miles
north
of
benares
the
story
is
that
brought
up
in
luxury
and
destined
to
reign
he
was
so
struck
with
the
miseries
of
mankind
that
at
the
age
of
he
left
his
parents
his
young
wife
and
an
only
son
and
retired
to
a
solitary
life
to
meditate
upon
the
cause
of
human
suffering
from
brahminical
teachers
he
could
obtain
no
solution
of
the
problem
but
after
seven
years
of
meditation
and
struggle
during
which
sore
temptations
to
return
to
a
life
of
sense
and
of
ease
were
successfully
resisted
he
attained
to
truth
and
to
peace
for
years
after
this
he
is
said
to
have
promulgated
his
doctrine
gathering
about
him
disciples
whom
he
charged
with
the
duty
of
spreading
it
abroad
the
buddhistic
buddhism
was
not
a
distinct
revolt
against
the
reigning
system
of
religion
buddha
left
theology
to
the
brahmans
indra
agni
and
the
other
divinities
and
the
services
rendered
to
them
he
left
untouched
being
an
anchorite
he
was
not
required
to
concern
himself
with
the
rites
and
observances
in
which
others
took
part
his
aim
was
practical
his
doctrine
though
resting
on
a
theoretical
basis
was
propounded
simply
as
a
way
of
salvation
from
the
burdens
that
oppressed
the
souls
of
men
nor
did
he
undertake
a
warfare
against
caste
the
blessing
of
deliverance
from
the
woes
of
life
he
opened
to
all
without
distinction
this
was
the
limit
of
his
opposition
to
caste
the
road
to
buddha
taught
that
existence
is
always
attended
with
misery
that
all
modes
of
misery
result
from
passion
or
desire
unsatisfied
that
desire
must
be
quenched
that
there
are
four
steps
in
doing
this
and
thus
of
arriving
at
nirvana
which
is
the
state
in
which
self
is
lost
and
absorbed
and
vanishes
from
being
these
four
ways
are
the
awakening
to
a
perception
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
evil
as
thus
defined
the
consequent
quenching
of
impure
and
revengeful
feelings
the
stifling
of
all
other
evil
desires
also
riddance
from
ignorance
doubt
heresy
unkindliness
and
vexation
the
entrance
into
nirvana
sooner
or
later
after
death
the
great
boon
which
buddha
held
out
was
escape
from
the
horrors
of
transmigration
he
attributed
to
the
soul
no
substantial
existence
it
is
the
or
another
being
the
successor
of
one
who
dies
the
result
and
effect
of
all
that
he
was
who
in
case
of
transmigration
buddhism
involved
atheism
and
the
denial
of
personal
immortality
or
where
this
last
tenet
was
not
explicitly
denied
uncertainty
and
indifference
respecting
it
on
the
foundation
of
buddha
teaching
there
grew
up
a
vast
system
of
monasticism
with
ascetic
usages
not
less
burdensome
than
the
yoke
of
caste
the
attractive
feature
of
buddhism
was
its
moral
precepts
these
were
chiefly
an
inculcation
of
chastity
patience
and
compassion
the
unresisting
endurance
of
all
ills
sympathy
and
efficient
help
for
all
men
deification
of
by
the
pupils
of
buddha
he
was
glorified
he
was
placed
among
the
brahminical
gods
by
whom
he
was
served
a
multitude
of
cloisters
were
erected
in
his
honor
in
which
his
relics
were
believed
to
be
preserved
on
the
basis
of
the
simpler
doctrine
and
precepts
of
the
founder
there
accumulated
a
mass
of
superstitious
beliefs
and
observances
the
spread
of
after
the
death
of
buddha
it
is
said
that
his
disciples
to
the
number
of
five
hundred
assembled
and
divided
his
teaching
into
three
branches
his
own
words
his
rules
of
discipline
and
his
system
of
doctrine
during
the
next
two
centuries
buddhism
spread
over
northern
india
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
agents
in
its
diffusion
was
the
king
of
behar
who
was
converted
to
the
buddhistic
faith
and
published
its
tenets
throughout
india
his
edicts
in
which
they
were
set
forth
were
engraved
on
rocks
and
pillars
and
in
caves
he
organized
missionary
efforts
among
the
aborigines
using
only
peaceful
means
and
combining
the
healing
of
disease
and
other
forms
of
philanthropy
with
preaching
he
carried
the
buddhistic
faith
as
far
as
it
spread
over
was
converted
and
between
the
fifth
and
seventh
centuries
of
our
era
through
central
asia
the
buddhistic
missionaries
passed
into
in
the
second
century
and
buddhism
became
an
established
system
there
as
early
as
at
present
this
religion
numbers
among
its
professed
adherents
more
than
a
third
of
the
human
race
the
brahminical
in
india
buddhism
did
not
supplant
the
old
religion
the
brahmans
modified
their
system
they
made
their
theology
more
plain
to
the
popular
apprehension
they
took
up
buddhistic
speculations
into
their
system
but
they
rendered
their
ceremonial
practices
more
complex
and
more
burdensome
their
ascetic
rule
grew
to
be
more
exacting
and
oppressive
in
diffusing
and
making
popular
their
system
customs
like
the
burning
of
widows
were
introduced
which
were
not
known
in
previous
times
the
divinities
the
author
of
all
things
the
preserver
and
the
destroyer
were
brought
into
a
relation
to
one
another
as
a

of
triad
successive
incarnations
of
vishnu
became
an
article
of

names
for
centuries
brahmanism
and
buddhism
existed
together
gradually
buddhism
decayed
and
melted
into
the
older
system
helping
to
modify
its
character
and
thus
to
give
rise
to
modern
hinduism

ten
centuries

times
has
been
made
to
irrigate
the
land
above
where
are
the
towns
and
dwellings
of
the
people
and
thus
to
extend
and
keep
up
its
unrivaled
fertility
the
country
of
old
was
divided
into
two
parts
egypt
as
it
is
now
called
with
for
its
principal
city
extending
from
the
first
cataract
near
to
the
memphian
district
and
egypt
embracing
the
rest
of
the
country
on
the
north
including
the
delta
the
two
divisions
were
marked
by
differences
of
dialect
and
of
customs
the
country
was
further
divided
into
or
districts
about
forty
in
all
but
varying
in
number
at
different
times
they
were
parted
from
one
another
by
boundary
stones
each
had
its
own
civil
organization
a
capital
and
a
center
of
worship
early
at
a
far
remote
day
there
existed
in
lower
egypt
an
advanced
type
of
culture
sepulchers
with
their
inscriptions
and
sculptures
were
made
of
so
solid
material
that
they
have
remained
to
testify
to
this
fact
when
the
pyramids
were
built
mechanical
skill
was
highly
developed
egyptian
art
had
reached
a
point
beyond
which
it
scarcely
advanced
and
the
administration
of
government
had
attained
substantially
to
the
form
in
which
it
continued
to
exist
the
use
of
writing
the
division
of
the
year
the
beginnings
of
the
sciences
and
of
literature
are
found
in
this
earliest
period
egyptian
culture
as
far
as
we
can
determine
was
not
borrowed
it
was
a
native
product
the
earliest
period
was
the
period
of
most
growth
the
prevailing
tendency
was
to
crystallize
all
arts
and
customs
into
definite
established
forms
and
to
subject
every
thing
to
fixed
rules
the
desire
to
preserve
what
had
been
gained
overmastered
the
impulses
to
progress
individuality
and
enterprise
were
blighted
by
an
excessive
spirit
of
conservatism
moreover
the
culture
of
the
egyptians
never
disengaged
itself
from
its
connection
with
practical
needs
or
the
material
spirit
that
lay
at
its
root
they
did
not
like
the
greeks
soar
into
the
atmosphere
of
theoretical
science
and
speculation
they
did
not
break
loose
from
the
fetters
of
tradition
the
we
owe
our
knowledge
of
ancient
egypt
chiefly
to
hieroglyphical
writing
the
hieroglyphs
except
those
denoting
numbers
were
pictures
of
objects
the
writing
is
of
three
kinds
the
the
hieroglyphical
is
composed
of
literal
pictures
as
a
circle
o
for
the
sun
a
curved
line
for
the
moon
a
pointed
oval
for
the
mouth
the
sort
of
characters
the
hieratic
and
the
the
demotic
are
curtailed
pictures
which
can
thus
be
written
more
rapidly
they
are
seldom
seen
on
the
monuments
but
are
the
writing
generally
found
on
the
papyrus
rolls
or
manuscripts
they
are
written
from
right
to
left
the
hieroglyphs
proper
may
be
written
either
way
or
in
a
perpendicular
line
in
the
demotic
or
people
writing
the
characters
are
somewhat
more
curtailed
or
abridged
than
in
the
hieratic
or
priestly
style
there
were
four
methods
of
using
the
hieroglyphics
in
historical
times
there
were
the
primary
representational
characters
the
literal
pictures
the
characters
were
used
figuratively
as
symbols
thus
a
circle
o
meant
not
only
the
sun
but
also
day
the
crescent
denoted
not
only
the
moon
but
also
a
month
a
pen
and
inkstand
signified
writing
etc
so
one
object
was
substituted
for
another
analogous
to
it
as
the
picture
of
a
boot
in
a
trap
which
stood
for
deceit
a
conventional
emblem
too
might
represent
the
object
thus
the
hawk
denoted
the
sun
two
meant
upper
and
lower
egypt
hieroglyphics
were
used
as
determinatives
that
is
an
object
would
be
denoted
by
letters
in
a
way
that
we
shall
soon
explain
and
a
picture
be
added
or
make
clear
what
was
meant
after
proper
names
they
designated
the
sex
after
the
names
of
other
classes
as
animals
they
specified
the
particular
genus
the
bulk
of
the
hieroglyphs
are
phonetic
they
stand
for
sounds
the
picture
stood
for
the
initial
sound
of
the
name
of
the
object
depicted
thus
the
picture
of
an
eagle
represented
a
unfortunately
numerous
objects
were
employed
for
a
like
purpose
to
indicate
the
same
sound
hence
the
number
of
characters
was
multiplied
the
whole
number
of
signs
used
in
writing
is
not
less
than
nine
hundred
or
a
thousand
the
discovery
of
the
rosetta
stone
a
large
black
slab
of
stone
with
an
identical
inscription
in
hieroglyphics
in
demotic
and
in
greek
furnished
to
and
to
the
clew
to
the
deciphering
of
the
egyptian
writing
and
thus
the
key
to
the
sense
of
the
monumental
inscriptions
the
egyptian
manuscripts
were
made
of
the
pith
of
the
byblus
plant
cut
into
strips
these
were
laid
side
by
side
horizontally
with
another
layer
of
strips
across
them
the
two
layers
being
united
by
paste
and
subjected
to
a
heavy
pressure
the
egyptians
wrote
with
a
reed
using
black
and
red
ink
sources
of
knowledge
of
egyptian
these
are
the
inscriptions
on
the
monuments
these
it
must
be
remembered
are
commonly
in
praise
of
the
departed
and
of
their
achievements
the
list
of
kings
in
the
turin
papyrus
a
very
important
egyptian
manuscript
discovered
by
champollion
an
egyptian
priest
he
wrote
about
a
history
only
his
lists
of
dynasties
are
preserved
as
given
in
an
armenian
version
of
a
writer
of
the
fourth
century
and
in
a
writer
of
the
eighth
century
who
professed
to
embody
the
statements
of
eusebius
and
of
another
author
probably
of
the
second
century
who
had
also
quoted
the
lists
of
manetho
manetho
is
of
great
importance
but
we
do
not
know
accurately
what
his
original
text
was
it
being
so
differently
reported
his
details
frequently
clash
with
the
monuments
moreover
the
method
adopted
by
him
in
making
his
lists
is
in
essential
points
subject
to
doubt
the
greek
historians
had
visited
egypt
between
and
and
conferred
with
egyptian
priests
also
in
the
time
of
julius
caesar
had
visited
egypt
he
is
largely
a
copyist
of
herodotus
the
old
testament
here
we
have
many
instructive
references
to
egypt
but
until
rehoboam
the
kings
of
egypt
have
in
the
scriptures
the
general
name
of
hence
it
is
not
always
easy
to
identify
them
with
corresponding
kings
on
the
egyptian
lists
the
date
of
the
beginning
of
the
first
dynasty
of
egyptian
rulers
is
a
controverted
point
there
are
advocates
of
a
longer
and
of
a
shorter
chronology
the
data
are
not
sufficient
to
settle
accurately
the
questions
in
dispute
some
judicious
scholars
put
the
beginning
of
first
as
early
as
others
have
wished
to
bring
it
down
even
lower
than
egyptian
history
prior
to
the
persian
conquest
divides
itself
into
three
sections
the
having
its
seat
at
memphis
the
following
upon
a
period
of
strife
and
division
and
embracing
the
rule
of
foreign
invaders
hyksos
and
the
the
era
of
conquest
by
foreign
power
and
of
downfall
the
expedition
of
shishak
king
of
egypt
against
rehoboam
is
ascertained
from
both
egyptian
and
hebrew
sources
to
have
been
not
earlier
than
and
within
years
of
that
date
the
nineteenth
egyptian
dynasty
began
about
the
year
the
middle
empire
is
thought
by
some
to
have
commenced
as
early
as
by
others
as
late
as
when
we
go
backward
into
the
old
empire
the
sources
of
uncertainty
are
multiplied
the
main
difficulty
is
to
determine
whether
the
lists
of
dynasties
are
throughout
or
in
part
one
class
of
scholars
place
the
date
of
the
first
historic
king
two
or
three
thousand
years
earlier
than
the
point
assigned
by
the
other
class
the
date
of
menes
given
by
is
by
by
by
by
or
makes
the
lowest
possible
date
for
menes
is
the
date
assigned
by
on
the
contrary
gives
and
between
and
there
are
no
means
of
fully
determining
the
controversy
as
rawlinson
has
shown
of
ancient
vol
it
appears
to
be
well
ascertained
that
egyptian
civilization
was
in
being
at
least
as
far
back
as
about
the
political
the
bulk
of
the
people
were
farmers
and
shepherds
indisposed
to
war
the
land
was
owned
in
large
estates
by
the
nobles
who
were
possessed
of
multitudes
of
serfs
and
of
cattle
they
had
in
their
service
also
artisans
oarsmen
and
traffickers
the
centers
of
industry
were
the
numerous
cities
here
the
nobles
had
their
mansions
and
the
gods
their
temples
with
retinues
of
priests
but
the
nomes
had
each
its
particular
jurisdiction
the
traces
of
two
original
communities
are
preserved
in
the
mythological
legends
and
in
the
titles
of
the
kings
the
oldest
inscriptions
discover
to
us
a
systematic
organization
of
the
state
the
king
is
supreme
under
him
are
the
rulers
of
the
two
halves
of
the
kingdom
he
creates
the
army
and
appoints
its
generals
the
whole
strength
of
the
kingdom
is
given
to
him
for
the
erection
of
the
temples
which
he
raises
to
the
gods
or
of
the
stupendous
pyramid
which
is
to
form
his
sepulcher
the
nobility
make
up
his
court
from
them
he
selects
his
chief
officers
of
state
his
secretary
his
treasurer
his
inspector
of
quarries
etc
the
princes
and
princesses
are
educated
in
connection
with
the
children
of
the
highest
nobles
a
protects
the
monarch
he
shows
himself
to
the
people
only
in
stately
processions
all
who
approach
him
prostrate
themselves
at
his
feet
he
is
the
descendant
of
the
gods
the
pharaohs
are
even
looked
upon
as
gods
incarnate
they
are
clothed
with
all
power
on
earth
when
they
die
they
go
to
the
gods
and
rites
of
worship
are
instituted
for
them
that
there
was
a
and
efficient
civil
administration
admits
of
no
doubt
whether
there
existed
a
thrifty
middle
class
or
not
we
can
not
decide
the
tendency
was
for
the
child
to
follow
the
vocation
of
the
parent
but
there
were
no
rigid
barriers
of
caste
not
until
the
new
empire
was
there
an
attempt
to
build
up
such
a
wall
even
about
the
priesthood
the
with
the
egyptians
religion
was
a
matter
of
supreme
and
absorbing
interest
there
was
a
popular
religion
and
there
arose
early
in
connection
with
it
an
esoteric
or
secret
doctrine
relative
to
the
gods
and
to
the
legends
respecting
them
a
lore
that
pertained
especially
to
the
priesthood
moreover
while
the
religious
system
from
the
earliest
date
is
polytheistic
we
have
proof
that
the
educated
class
sooner
or
later
put
a
monotheistic
interpretation
upon
it
and
believed
in
one
supreme
deity
of
whom
all
the
particular
gods
were
so
many
forms
and
manifestations
or
that
one
being
under
different
names
whether
this
more
elevated
faith
preceded
the
reigning
system
or
was
a
later
offspring
of
it
is
a
matter
of
dispute
for
a
long
period
the
two
and
without
collision
the
great
divinities
of
egypt
are
gods
of
light
they
are
associated
with
the
sun
with
the
agency
of
that
luminary
with
his
rising
and
setting
they
stand
in
a
close
relation
all
egypt
worships
the
sun
under
the
names
of
and
horus
is
the
adversary
of
called
by
the
greeks
the
god
of
darkness
and
is
born
anew
every
morning
to
attack
and
conquer
him
in
honor
of
ra
the
lofty
obelisks
or
symbols
of
the
sun
rays
are
erected
each
of
which
has
its
own
name
and
priests
with
the
are
joined
the
goddesses
of
the
heavens
and
others
but
became
the
most
famous
his
worship
was
originally
at
abydos
and
busiris
at
length
his
cult
spread
over
the
whole
land
in
the
legend
he
is
murdered
by
seth
but
horus
is
his
avenger
horus
conquers
the
power
of
darkness
henceforward
osiris
reigns
in
the
kingdom
of
the
west
the
home
of
the
dead
he
is
the
sun
in
the
realm
of
the
shades
he
receives
the
dead
is
their
protector
and
the
judge
whose
final
award
is
blessedness
or
perpetual
misery
the
departed
if
their
lives
have
not
been
wicked
become
one
with
him
they
are
each
of
them
called
by
his
name
to
osiris
all
sepulchral
inscriptions
are
addressed
his
career
with
the
victory
of
the
power
of
darkness
over
him
and
his
glorious
revival
in
the
regions
of
the
west
typifies
human
life
and
destiny
the
principal
god
at
memphis
is
the
primal
divinity
the
former
of
heaven
and
earth
yet
perhaps
a
god
of
light
since
he
is
styled
by
the
greeks
at
thebes
was
revered
as
the
king
of
the
gods
he
shared
in
the
properties
of
the
sun
is
the
chief
who
presides
over
the
reckoning
of
time
he
is
the
god
of
letters
and
of
the
arts
the
author
of
sacred
books
the
nile
is
worshiped
under
the
name
of
being
figured
as
a
man
with
pendent
breasts
an
emblem
of
the
fertility
of
the
river
the
gods
were
often
connected
in
triads
there
being
in
each
a
father
a
mother
and
a
son
to
bring
to
them
the
right
offerings
and
to
repeat
the
right
formulas
was
a
matter
of
momentous
concern
homage
was
directed
to
the
material
objects
with
which
the
activity
of
the
god
was
thought
to
be
connected
and
in
which
he
was
believed
to
be
present
all
nature
was
full
of
deities
there
were
sacred
trees
stones
utensils
above
all
animals
in
their
mysterious
life
were
identified
with
the
divinities
worship
was
offered
to
the
crocodile
the
cat
the
bull
etc
in
the
temples
these
creatures
were
carefully
tended
and
obsequiously
served
believing
that
the
soul
survives
death
the
egyptians
linked
its
weal
with
the
preservation
of
the
body
from
which
they
could
not
conceive
its
destiny
to
be
wholly
dissevered
thus
arose
the
universal
practice
of
embalming
and
of
presenting
at
intervals
offerings
of
food
and
drink
to
the
departed
the
tomb
contains
a
room
for
sacred
services
to
the
dead
the
most
ancient
structures
are
sepulchers
they
were
the
germ
of
the
pyramid
in
which
rested
the
sarcophagus
of
the
king
religion
and
the
leading
gods
were
held
to
be
the
makers
of
the
world
and
of
men
the
givers
of
good
the
rulers
and
disposers
of
all
things
morality
was
not
separated
from
religion
the
gods
punished
unrighteousness
and
inhumanity
in
the
age
of
the
family
life
was
not
wanting
in
purity
the
wife
and
mother
was
held
in
respect
monogamy
prevailed
was
the
goddess
of
truth
in
the
myth
of
osiris
it
is
in
her
hall
that
the
dead
are
judged
the
the
priests
are
the
guardians
of
religious
rites
they
are
acquainted
with
the
origin
and
import
of
them
their
knowledge
is
communicated
only
to
select
believers
it
was
a
body
of
traditions
guarded
as
a
mysterious
treasure
but
the
priests
certainly
until
a
late
period
do
not
control
the
king
the
civil
authority
is
uppermost
literature
and
the
most
important
egyptian
book
that
has
come
down
to
us
is
the
of
the
it
relates
in
a
mystical
strain
the
adventures
of
the
soul
after
death
and
explains
how
by
reciting
the
names
and
titles
of
numberless
gods
and
by
means
of
other
theological
knowledge
the
soul
can
make
its
way
to
the
hall
of
osiris
it
is
a
monument
of
the
pedantic
and
punctilious
formalism
of
the
egyptian
ritual
most
of
the
papyri
that
have
been
preserved
are
of
a
religious
character
there
are
songs
not
void
of
beauty
the
moral
writings
are
of
a
decidedly
higher
grade
works
of
fiction
are
constructed
with
considerable
skill
and
are
sometimes
not
wanting
in
humor
some
of
the
hymns
are
not
destitute
of
merit
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
there
were
important
mathematical
writings
astronomical
observations
were
very
early
made
in
medicine
we
have
writings
which
prove
that
considerable
proficiency
was
attained
in
this
department
but
here
as
in
other
branches
the
spirit
was
empirical
rather
than
scientific
in
the
higher
sense
and
the
result
was
to
petrify
knowledge
in
an
unalterable
form
at
length
rules
of
medical
treatment
with
specific
remedies
were
definitely
settled
from
which
it
was
a
crime
against
the
state
to
deviate
the
old
empire
to
about
who
belongs
to
the
third
dynasty
is
the
first
king
who
has
left
behind
him
a
monumental
inscription
a
in
the
peninsula
of
sinai

it
is
the
culminating
point
of
egyptian
culture
the
middle
empire
from
about
to
the
season
of
prosperity
under
the
twelfth
dynasty
was
followed
by
anarchy
and
the
downfall
of
the

rule
according
to
it
was
under
a
king
named
that
a
horde
of
invaders
the
or
shepherds
came
in
from
the
north
devastated
the
country
and
made
themselves
its
rulers
they
were
probably
of
semitic
descent
but
nothing
more
is
known
as
to
their
origin
in
connection
with
them
semitic
and
in
particular
canaanite
elements
penetrated
into
egypt
and
left
their
traces
in
its
language
the
residence
of
their
kings
was
on
the
eastern
delta
a
splendid
city
which
they
still
more
adorned
they
conquered
memphis
but
their
power
was
not
permanently
established
in
lower
egypt
the
duration
of
their
control
was
a
number
of
centuries
how
many
can
only
be
conjectured
it
is
believed
by
some
scholars
that
either
or
kings
of
the
hyksos
line
was
the
sovereign
who
made
his
prime
minister
and
invited
his
family
to
settle
in
the
land
of
goshen
the
elevation
of
a
foreigner
and
a
semite
to
an
exalted
office
is
thought
to
be
less
improbable
in
connection
with
a
semitic
dynasty
the
new
empire
from
to
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksos
was
effected
by
first
king
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
it
was
accomplished
however
not
all
at
once
but
gradually
from
this
event
egypt
enters
on
a
new
stage
in
its
career
it
becomes
a
military
an
aggressive
and
a
conquering
state
notwithstanding
the
enormous
sacrifice
of
life
that
must
have
been
involved
in
the
erection
of
pyramids
and
in
other
public
works
the
egyptians
had
not
been
a
cruel
people
compared
with
most
semitic
peoples
they
had
been
disposed
to
peace
but
now
a
martial
spirit
is
evoked
a
military
class
arises
wars
for
plunder
and
conquest
ensue
the
use
of
horses
in
battle
is
a
new
and
significant
fact
the
character
of
the
people
changes
for
the
worse
the
priestly
class

more
compact

domineering

the
principal
edifices

this

babylonia
on

were

of
these
were
the
warlike
the
sumerians
who
preceded
the
semites
in
the
occupancy
of
babylonia
were
of
an
unknown
stock
they
were
the
founders
of
babylonian
culture
even
by
them
the
soil
was
skillfully
cultivated
with
the
help
of
dikes
and
canals
they
were
the
inventors
of
the
cuneiform
writing
the
cuneiform
characters
were
originally
pictures
but
these
were
resolved
into
characters
of
uniform
appearance
the
significance
of
which
was
determined
by
their
position
and
local
relation
to
one
another
it
is
not
known
how
long
the
sumerian
period
lasted
nor
even
when
it
closed
the
chronology
of
the
earliest
semitic
period
is
also
very
uncertain
the
kings
of
lagash
and
of
a
district
which
included
are
dated
by
most
assyriologists
as
early
as
or
even
earlier
whether
they
were
sumerians
or
semites
is
not
certain
their
inscriptions
do
not
settle
the
question
it
was
probably
not
far
from
this
time
however
that
the
one
race
supplanted
the
other
a
semitic
people
coming
either
directly
from
the
ancestral
home
arabia
or
from
a
previous
settlement
in
mesopotamia
of
babylonia
invaded
the
land
and
conquered
the
sumerians
they
planted
themselves
first
in
northern
babylonia
and
then
gradually
extended
their
power
over
the
districts
on
the
south
the
conquerors
adopted
the
civilization
of
the
conquered
the
earliest
semitic
kings
all
used
the
sumerian
dialect
in
their
inscriptions
it
was
only
by
slow
degrees
that
the
native
language
was
superseded
by
that
of
the
new
rulers
later
before
the
time
of
see
below
these
semites
carried
their
settlements
northward
and
became
the

of

sources
of
a
babylonian
priest
wrote
a
history
of
his
country
as
early
as
he
was
a
trustworthy
writer
as
far
as
his
means
of
knowledge
went
but
it
is
only
fragments
of
his
work
that
we
possess

these
in

partly
at

greek
writers
as
drew
from
persian
sources
and
their
narratives
up
to
the
later
times
of
the

can
not
be
relied
on
the
great
source
of

is
the
rapidly
increasing
store
of
records
in
the
cuneiform
character
a
vast
number
of
inscriptions
on
stone
and
clay
representing
nearly
every
department
of
literature
have
been
unearthed
and
the
material
which
they
afford
has
already
given
us
an
extensive
knowledge
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
history
the
site
of
has
been
extensively
excavated
and
we
have
therefore
especially
full
information
as
to
the
history
and
literature
of
assyria
babylonian
monuments
in
considerable
number
have
more
recently
come
to

aside
from
nineveh
and
babylon
especially
important
excavations
have
been
undertaken
at
telloh
thus
far
the
chief
source
of
sumerian
material
and
i
the
old
kingdom
of
babylon
early
the
history
of
ancient
babylonia
is
still
very
obscure
and
the
chronology
only
tentative
we
see
at
first
a
number
of
independent
cities
each
ruled
by
a
petty
king
who
was
also
a
priest
then
appear
groups
of
cities
one
of
which
exercised
sway
over
a
more
or
less
extended
district
the
center
of
power
was
now
in

now
in
ur
or
babylon
or
some
other
city
whose
king
ruled
supreme
over
numerous
vassal
kings
among
the
first
important
names
known
to
us
are
those
of
king
of
agade
a
great
conqueror
and
builder
and
his
son
another
great
builder
was
king
of
shirpurla
most
conspicuous
of
all
is
king
of
babylon
who
is
probably
the
amraphel
of
xiv
his
kingdom
included
not
only
the
whole
of
babylonia
proper
but
also
assyria
and
probably
even
the
west
land
as
far
as
the
mediterranean
the
records
show
him
to
have
been
a
truly
great
ruler
both
in
war
and
in
peace
he
is
known
to
us
chiefly
from
a
collection
of
his
to
certain
officials
of
his
kingdom
and
from
his
elaborate
of
civil
laws
found
at
susa
in
and
first
published
in
perhaps
the
most
important
single
monument
of
early
civilization
which
has
thus
far
come
to
light
the
laws
written
in
the
babylonian
semitic
language
and
engraved
on
a
stele
of
hard
black
stone
were
about
two
hundred
and
eighty
in
number
and
bear
an
interesting
general
resemblance
to
the
old
hebrew
laws
especially
those
preserved
in
exodus
xxi
and
xxii
in
the
time
of
the
kings
and
about
falls
the
see
at
in
upper
egypt
were
unearthed
in
more
than
three
hundred
clay
tablets
containing
diplomatic
dispatches
written
in
the
cuneiform
character
and
nearly
all
in
the
babylonian
language
they
were
addressed
to
the
egyptian
king
or
to
his
ministers
and
had
been
sent
from
various
officials
and
royal
personages
in
babylonia
assyria
palestine
including
a
number
of
letters
from
of
and
other
districts
they
furnish
a
large
amount
of
important
information
as
to
conditions
in
western
asia
at
that
early
period
an
important
dynasty
occupied
the
throne
of
babylon
from
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
twelfth
century
under
these
kassite
rulers
the
kingdom
at
length
declined
while
the
neighboring
assyrian
state
had
increased
in
power
later
still
apparently
not
earlier
than
the
ninth
century
the
of
semitic
stock
pushed
into
babylonia
from
their
district
about
the
mouth
of
the
euphrates
and
eventually
made
themselves
masters
of
the
land
religion
and
if
the
events
connected
with
old
babylon
are
less
known
more
is
ascertained
respecting
its
civilization
the
groundwork
as
was
stated
was
laid
by
the
earlier
conquered
people
the
religion
of
the
babylonians
rested
on
the
basis
of
the
old
sumerian
worship
there
was
homage
to
demons
powerful
for
good
or
for
evil
who
were
brought
together
into
groups
and
were
figured
now
as
human
beings
now
as
lions
or
other
wild
animals
or
as
dragons
and
that
sort
of
monsters
of
the
great
gods
the
god
of
the
sky
was
the
father
and
king
of
all
the
a
sumerian
divinity
at
the
outset
had
the
highest
rank
or
however
a
semitic
divinity
was
the
god
of
the
earth
and
particularly
of
mankind
was
the
god
of
the
deep
and
of
the
underworld
the
early
development
of
astrology
and
its
great
influence
in
old
babylon
were
closely
connected
with
the
supposed
association
of
the
luminaries
above
with
the
gods
the
stars
were
thought
to
indicate
at
the
birth
of
a
child
what
his
fortunes
would
be
and
to
afford
the
means
of
foretelling
other
remarkable
events
a
goddess
of
war
and
of
love
was
worshiped
also
under
the
name
the
greek
this
deity
embodied
the
the
spring
of
fertility
whose
beneficent
agency
was
seen
in
the
abundant
harvest
she
was
clothed
with
sensual
attributes
and
propitiated
with
unchaste
rites
it
was
in
the
worship
of
this
divinity
that
the
coarse
and
licentious
side
of
the
semitic
nature
expressed
itself
at
the
same
time
there
was
an
opposite
ascetic
side
in
the
service
of
this
deity
her
priests
were
eunuchs
they
ministered
at
her
altar
in
woman
attire
on
the
relation
of
the
human
soul
to
the
gods
and
its
condition
after
death
there
was
little
speculation
in
general
the
babylonians
were
more
interested
in
religion
and
worship
than
the
assyrians
the
former
erected
temples
the
latter
palaces
the
attainments
of
the
early
babylonians
in
mathematics
and
astronomy
were
far
beyond
those
of
the
egyptians
they
divided
the
year
into
twelve
months
and
arrived
at
the
signs
of
the
ecliptic
or
zodiac
the
week
they
fixed
at
seven
days
by
the
course
of
the
moon
they
divided
the
day
into
twelve
hours
and
the
hour
into
sixty
minutes
they
invented
weights
and
measures
the
knowledge
of
which
went
from
them
to
the
other
asiatic
nations
architecture
as
regards
taste
was
in
a
rude
state
in
pottery
they
showed
much
skill
and
ingenuity
and
invented
the
potter
wheel
in
the
engraving
of
gems
and
in
the
manufacture
of
delicate
fabrics
linen
muslin
and
silk
they
were
expert
trade
and
commerce
favored
by
the
position
of
babylon
began
to
flourish
as
regards
literature
the
libraries
of
nineveh
and
babylon
at
a
later
day
contained
many
books
translated
from
the
early
sumerian
language
among
them
are
the
gilgamesh
legends
in
which
is
contained
a
story
of
the
flood
that
resembles
in
essential
features
the
account
in
genesis
ii
the
assyrian
empire
growth
of
its
assyria
was
even
greater
as
a
conquering
power
than
babylon
in
the
legends
current
among
the
greeks
the
of
the
monarchy
and
of
nineveh
its
capital
as
well
as
of
babylon
is
referred
to
the
legendary
heroes
and
his
queen
the
name
of
ninus
is
not
recorded
on
the
monuments
and
is
perhaps
a
kind
of
mythical
personification
of
assyrian
conquests
and
grandeur
and
the
name
of
semiramis
does
not
appear
until
the
ninth
century
she
may
have
been
a
princess
or
even
queen
assyrian
independence
began
before
between
and
assyria
was
a
weak
state
it
gained
a
brief
mastery
over
babylon
through
a
conquest
by
spread
his
conquests
to
the
mediterranean
and
the
caspian
on
the
west
and
south
to
the
persian
gulf
but
these
early
acquisitions
of
assyria
were
transient
there
ensued
a
long
interval
until
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
when
the
monarchy
was
mostly
confined
within
its
own
proper
borders
a
new
series
of
strong
and
aggressive
princes
arose

conflicts
of
damascus

of

his

dug
up
from
the
grave
in
which
it
had
been
buried
for
two
and
a
half
decades
of
centuries
that
has
yielded
a
vast
amount
of
welcome
information
concerning
assyrian
and
babylonian
history
far
back
into
the
sumerian
period
religion
and
it
has
been
stated
that
the
assyrian
culture
was
transplanted
from
babylon
the
religion
was
substantially
the
same
except
that
the
tutelary
deity
of
the
country
was
made
supreme
the
assyrians
from
the
start
were
devoted
to
war
pillage
and
conquest
their
unsparing
cruelty
and
brutal
treatment
of
their
enemies
are
abundantly
witnessed
by
their
own
monuments
they
lacked
the
productive
power
in
literature
and
art
which
belonged
to
the
babylonians
although
they
might
have
built
their
edifices
of
stone
they
generally
made
use
of
brick
their
sculptures
in
relief
were
much
better
than
the
full
figures
they
laid
color
upon
their
works
in
sculpture
but
their
art
was
merely
a
pictorial
record
of
events
the
sense
of
beauty
and
creative
power
were
wanting
the
more
religious
character
of
the
babylonians
created
a
difference
in
the
architecture
of
the
two
peoples
in
both
were
singularly
expert
the
assyrians
gave
less
attention
to
the
burial
of
the
dead
they
showed
an
aptitude
for
trade
and
nineveh
in
the
eighth
and
seventh
centuries
was
a
busy
mart
the
fall
of
the
first
important
blow
at
the
assyrian
imperial
rule
was
struck
by
the
after
nearly
a
century
of
resistance
they
had
been
subdued
and
were
subject
to
assyria
for
a
century
after
in
they
rose
in
revolt
under
one
of
their
native
chiefs
who
fell
in
battle
the
struggle
was
continued
by
his
son
his
plans
were
interrupted
however
by
the
irruption
of
the
scythians
more
than
a
century
before
these
wandering
asiatic
tribes
had
begun
to
make
predatory
incursions
into
asia
minor
when
was
before
nineveh
they
came
down
in
greater
force
and
a
horde
of
them
moving
southward
from
the
river
halys
invaded
syria
jerusalem
and
the
stronger
cities
held
out
against
them
but
the
open
country
was
devastated
they
were
met
by
king
of
egypt
and
bribed
to
turn
back
they
entered
babylonia
but
the
viceroy
of
sardanapalus
successfully
defended
the
city
of
babylon
against
their
attacks
by
either
these
or
another
horde
were
defeated
but
it
was
not
until
that
the
region
south
of
the
black
sea
was
cleared
of

the

now
come
to

an

was
a
city
of
the
highest
antiquity
the
name
gate
of
god
is
semitic
the
city
is
mentioned
in
the
earliest
cuneiform
records
and
from
the
time
of
hammurabi
was
the
chief
city
of
the
land
destroyed
by
sennacherib
it
was
rebuilt
by
esarhaddon
but
not
fully
restored
and
adorned
until
the
reigns
of
nabopolassar
and
nebuchadnezzar
babylon
surpassed
all
ancient
cities
in
size
and
magnificence
its
walls
were
forty
miles
in
circumference
this
extent
of
wall
probably
included
borsippa
or
babylon
the
second
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
babylon
proper
was
mainly
on
the
left
within
the
walls
were
inclosed
gardens
orchards
and
fields
the
space
was
only
filled
in
part
by
buildings
but
the
whole
area
was
laid
out
with
straight
streets
intersecting
one
another
at
right
angles
like
the
streets
of
philadelphia
the
wall
was
pierced
by
a
hundred
gates
probably
in
each
face
the
euphrates
lined
with
quays
on
both
sides
and
spanned
with
drawbridges
ran
through
the
town
dividing
it
into
two
nearly
equal
parts
the
city
was
protected
without
by
a
deep
and
wide
moat
the
wall
was
at
least
seventy
or
eighty
feet
in
height
and
of
vast
and
unusual
thickness
on
the
summit
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
towers
placed
along
the
outer
and
inner
edges
opposite
to
one
another
but
so
far
apart
according
to
herodotus
that
there
was
room
for
a
chariot
to
pass
between
the
temple
of
was
in
a
square
inclosure
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
both
in
length
and
breadth
the
tower
of
the
temple
was
ascended
on
the
outside
by
an
inclined
plane
carried
around
the
four
sides
an
exaggerated
statement
of
makes
its
height
six
hundred
and
six
feet
possibly
this
represents
the
length
of
the
inclined
plane
in
the
shrine
on
the
top
were
a
golden
table
and
a
couch
according
to
before
the
persian
conquest
there
were
colossal
golden
images
of
three
divinities
with
two
golden
lions
and
two
enormous
serpents
of
silver
it
is
thought
that
herodotus
may
have
described
the
splendid
temple
of
now
and
have
mistaken
it
by
reason
of
its
enormous
ruins
for
the
temple
of
which
it
rivaled
in
magnificence
the
great
palace
is
represented
to
have
been
larger
than
the
temple
of
bel
the
outermost
of
its
three
inclosing
walls
being
three
miles
in

its
exterior
was
of
baked
brick
the

was
a
structure
built
on

each
supported
by

covered
on

at

height
of
at

feet
with
a
great
mass
of

in
which
grew
flowers
and

and
even

to
transport
to
their

multitudes
of

whom
they
carried

delighting
in
the

thus
engendered
the
phoenicians
were
not
ambitious
of
conquest
although
conquerors
upon
the
sea
they
were
not
a
martial
people
like
commercial
states
generally
they
preferred
peace

they
dwelt
careless
after
the
manner

secure
this
pacific
temper
was
coupled
with
a
fervent
attachment
to
their
own
land
and
to
their
countrymen
wherever
they
went
but
they
lacked
the
political
instinct
they
did
not
appreciate
liberty
and
their
love
of
traffic
and
of
gain
often
made
them
prefer
to
pay
tribute
rather
than
to
fight
their
colonies
were
factories
but
were
not
centers
of
further
conquest

authority
slew
his
uncle
who
was
to
marry
pygmalion

on

of
this
internal
conflict
and
from
dread
of
the
assyrian
power
a
large
number
of
the
old

emigrated
to
north
africa
and
founded
carthage
about
the
phoenician
cities
were
confederated
together
under
hereditary
kings
whose
power
was
limited
by
the
lay
and
priestly
aristocracy
the
common
people
many
of
whom
were
skilled
artisans
made
themselves
felt
in
some
degree
in
public
affairs
the
mercantile
class
were
influential
thus
there
was
developed
a
germinant
municipal
feeling
and
organization
the
strong
city
tyre
is
mentioned
in

in
tyre
is
described
as
the
crowning
city

whose
traffickers

the
fate

pointed

religion
and
a
very
prominent
feature
of
the
religion
of
the
phaenicians
is
the
local
character
of
their
divinities
the
word
lord
or
god
was
not
used
in
phaenicia
as
the
proper
name
of
any
one
god
but
such
names
as
lord
of
sidon
god
of
lebanon
are
common
was
the
most
common
name
for
the
local
female
divinities
the
gods
were
often
thought
of
as
dwelling
in
stones
trees
and
other
objects
the
worship
of
and
sacred
poles
translated
grove
in
the
english
bible
was
especially
common
in
phaenicia
on
the
other
hand
a
god
of
heaven
and
a
goddess
of
heaven
were
worshiped
in
the
religion
of
the
phaenicians
the
more
elevated
ingredients
of
the
semitic
heathenism
are
in
the
background
the
sensual
features
of
it
are
more
prominent

savage
elements
are
introduced

adapted

to

in

the
wailing
of

if
it
was
not
stifled
by

was
drowned
by

as

had
reduced
the

that
the

laid
two

of
the

of

they
were
allowed

the

in

struggles
against

the

defended
themselves
with
valor

for
five
years
repelled
his
assaults
although
the

bringing

were
cut
off
and
the
besieged
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
the
scanty
supply
to
be
gained
from
wells
dug
with
great
labor
soon
the
tyrian
fleets
regained
their
mastery
on
the
sea
when
nebuchadnezzar
captured
old
tyre
and
a
multitude
of
its
inhabitants
shared
the
lot
of
the
jews
and
were
dragged
off
by
the
conqueror
to
the
euphrates
the
island
city
withstood
his
attack
for
thirteen
years
and
did
not
yield
until
it
extorted
from
him
a
treaty
but
the
power
of
resistance
was
weakened
by
the
repeated
invasions
and
domination
of

and
babylon
tyre
submitted
to
persia
after
the
downfall
of
the
babylonian
monarchy
and
added
her
fleet
to
the

forces
although
to
the
phoenician
towns
was
left
a
degree
of
freedom
and
their
local
government
sidon
tyre
and
arados
had
a
council
of
their
own
which
met
with
their
respective
kings
and
senators
at
tripolis
for
the
regulation
of
matters
of
common
interest
manufactures
and
commerce
continued
to
flourish
under
the
persian
supremacy
sidon
once
more
became
the
chief
city
in
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
it
revolted
against
the
tyranny
of
the
foreign
governors
the
persian
king
ordered
that
the
noblest
citizens
should
be
put
to
death
whereupon
the
inhabitants
set
the
city
on
fire
and
destroyed
themselves
and
their

in

remained
but
ventured
to
resist

after
his
conquest
of

by

was
captured
and

demolished
after
the
death
of

fell
under
the
sway
of
the
at
antioch
and
for
a
time
of
the
egyptian
both
tyre
and
sidon
were
rebuilt
and
flourished
anew
it
is
probably
to
the
third
century
that
we
should
assign
the
native
sidonian
dynasty
which
included
the
kings
tabnit
and
whose
names
are
known
to
us
from
inscriptions

of

the
most
prominent
of
all
the
phoenician
settlements
was
carthage
it
had
remarkable
advantages
of
situation
its
harbor
was
sufficient
for
the
anchorage
of
the
largest
vessels
and
it
had
a
fertile
territory
around
it
these
circumstances
in
conjunction
with
the
energy
of
its
inhabitants
placed
it
at
the
head
of
the
phoenician
colonies
in
carthage
there
was
no
middle
class
there
were
the
rich
landholders
and
merchants
and
the
common
people
the
government
was
practically
an
oligarchy
there
were
two
kings
or
judges
with
little
power
and
a
or
possibly
a
second
council
also
but
the
senate
and
magistrates
were
subordinate
to
an
aristocratic
body
the
the
bulk
of
the
citizens
had
little
more
than
a
nominal
influence

carthage
was
moved
to
deviate
from
the
policy
of
the
parent
cities
and
to
make
herself
the
champion
protector
and
mistress
of
the
phoenician
dependencies
in
all
that
region
thus
she
became
the
head
of
a
empire
which
asserted
its
supremacy
against
its
greek
adversaries
in
sicily
and
spain
as
well
as
in
lybia
when
tyre
was
subjugated
by

carthage
was
strengthened
by
the
immigration
of
many
of
the
best
tyrian

the
contest
was
renewed
from

the

worship

to

of

divinities

to
that
service
which
was
diffused
through
the
semitic
nations
of

a

constituted
to
be
the
guardian
of
this
light
kindled
in
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
darkness
to
carry

of

was
not

a
military
leader
and
a
legislator
he
stands
at
the
head
of
the
the
class
of
men
who
at
different
times
especially
in
seasons
of
national
peril
and
temptation
along
the
whole
course
of
israelitish
history
were
raised
up
to
declare
the
will
of
jehovah
to
utter
the
lessons
proper
to
the
hour
to
warn
and
to
comfort
the
desponding
conquest
of
canaan
the
era
of
the
moses
himself
did
not
enter
the
promised
land
where
the
patriarchs
were
buried
and
which
the
israelites
were
to
conquer
according
to
deut
vii
a
war
of
extermination
was
commanded
the
reason
given
for
the
command
was
that
the
people
must
avoid
the
contagion
of
idolatry
that
it
was
the
fit
reward
of
the
nation
which
they
were
bidden
to
dispossess
the
word
canaanite
was
used
especially
to
designate
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
region
of
palestine
it
was
applied
however
to
all
the
tribes
who
were
under
kings
or
chiefs
in
the
time
of
joshua
there
were
six
principal
tribes
the
and
these
with
the
exception
of
the
and
possibly
the
were
semitic
in
their
language
the
canaanites
had
houses
and
vineyards
from
them
the
israelites
learned
agriculture
they
were
in
possession
of
fortified
towns
treasures
of
brass
iron
gold
and
foreign
merchandise
their
religious
rites
were
brutal
and
debasing
human
sacrifice
licentious
orgies
the
worship
of
a
host
of
divinities
on
the
death
of
moses
succeeded
to
the
post
of
a
leader
he
defeated
the
and
other
tribes
on
the
east
of
the
jordan
after
the
first
victories
of
joshua
each
tribe
carried
on
for
itself
the
struggle
with
canaanites
victory
over
them
being
often
followed
by
indiscriminate
slaughter
it
is
plain
however
especially
from
the
account
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
book
of
judges
that
there
was
a
process
of
assimilation
as
well
as
one
of
conquest
the
actual
settlement
was
effected
by
peaceful
as
well
as
by
warlike
methods
resistance
was
stubborn
and
the
progress
of
occupation
slow
it
was
not
until
david
time
centuries
after
the
invasion
that
the
site
of
jerusalem
was
captured
this
delay
was
due
largely
to
a
lack
of
union
not
to
a
lack
of
valor
the
strength
of
the
israelites
was
in
their
infantry
hence
they
preferred
to
fight
upon
the
hills
rather
than
to
cope
with
horsemen
and
chariots
on
the
plains
below
the
period
of
the
the
era
of
the
judges
extends
from
about
over
at
least
two
centuries
powerful
tribes
as
were
unsubdued
the
land
was
desolated
by
constant
war
it
was
one
sure
sign
of
the
prevailing
disorder
and
anarchy
that
the
highways
were
unoccupied
and
the
travelers
walked
through
byways
judg
not
unfrequently
the
people
forgot
jehovah
and
fell
into
idolatrous
practices
in
this
period
of
degeneracy
and
confusion
men
full
of
sacred
enthusiasm
and
of
heroic
courage
arose
to
smite
the
enemies
of
israel
and
to
restore
the
observance
of
the
law
of
these
heroic
leaders
and
were
the
most
famous
there
remains
the
song
of
deborah
on
the
defeat
and
death
of
judg
the
on
the
western
coast
captured
the
sacred
ark
an
act
that
spread
dismay
among
the
israelites
then
they
pushed
on
their
conquests
as
far
as
the
jordan
took
away
from
the
israelites
their
weapons
and
grievously
oppressed
them
the
threatened
the
tribes
on
the
east
of
the
jordan
with
a
like
fate
at
this
juncture
an
effective
leader
and
reformer
appeared
in
the
person
of
who
had
been
consecrated
from
his
youth
up
to
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
and
whose
devotion
to
the
law
was
mingled
with
an
ardent
patriotism
he
roused
the
courage
of
the
people
and
recalled
them
to
the
service
of
jehovah
in
the
schools
of
the
prophets
he
taught
the
young
the
law
trained
them
in
music
and
song
and
thus
prepared
a
class
of
inspiring
teachers
and
guides
to
with
the
priesthood
in
upholding
the
cause
of
religion
the
monarchy
samuel
and
in
the
distracted
condition
of
the
country
the
people
demanded
a
king
to
unite
them
and
lead
them
to
victory
and
to
administer
justice
they
felt
that
their
lack
of
compact
organization
and
defined
leadership
placed
them
at
a
disadvantage
in
comparison
with
the
tribes
about
this
demand
resisted
as
springing
out
of
a
distrust
of
jehovah
and
as
involving
a
rejection
of
him
he
depicted
the
burdens
which
regal
government
would
bring
upon
them
later
history
verified
his
prediction
a
strong
centralized
authority
was
not
in
harmony
with
the
family
and
tribal
government
which
was
the
peculiarity
of
their
system
it
brought
in
by
the
side
of
the
prophetic
order
another
authority
less
sacred
in
its
claims
to
respect
collisions
between
the
two
must
inevitably
result
but
whatever
might
be
the
ideal
political
system
the
exigency
was
such
that
samuel
yielded
to
the
persistent
call
of
the
people
he
himself
chose
and
anointed
for
the
office
a
tall
brave
and
experienced
soldier
successful
in
combat
the
king
soon
fell
into
a
conflict
with
the
prophet
by
failing
to
comply
with
the
divine
law
and
by
sparing
contrary
to
the
injunction
laid
upon
him
prisoners
and
cattle
that
he
had
captured
thereupon
samuel
secretly
anointed
a
young
shepherd
of
the
tribe
of
judah
thus
designating
him
for
the
throne
the
envy
of
saul
at
the
achievements
of
david
and
at
his
growing
popularity
coupled
with
secret
suspicion
of
what
higher
honors
might
be
in
store
for
the
valiant
youth
embittered
the
king
against
him
david
was
befriended
and
shielded
by
saul
son
who
might
naturally
be
looked
upon
as
his
suitable
successor
the
memorials
of
the
friendship
of
these
two
youths
in
the
annals
of
that
troublous
time
are
like
a
star
in
the
darkest
night
david
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
among
the
philistines
where
he
led
a
band
of
free
lances
whom
the
philistines
did
not
trust
as
auxiliaries
but
who
were
inured
by
their
daring
combats
for
the
struggles
that
came
afterwards
saul
and
jonathan
were
slain
saul
by
his
own
hand
for
six
years
david
was
king
in
over
the
tribes
of
judah
and
benjamin
the
other
tribes
were
ruled
by
son
at
length
david
was
recognized
as
king
by
all
the
tribes
saul
family
were
exterminated
there
is
much
difficulty
in
settling
the
chronology
in
the
early
centuries
of
the
regal
period
of
hebrew
history
apart
from
the
questions
which
arise
in
comparing
the
biblical
data
the
information
derived
from
egyptian
and
especially
from
assyrian
sources
has
to
be
taken
into
account
hence
the
dates
given
below
must
be
regarded
as
open
to
revision
as
our
knowledge
increases
assyriologists
find
that
shalmaneser
ii
received
tribute
from
king
of
israel
and
from
that
received
tribute
from
in
and
that
samaria
fell
in
assyriology
on
the
basis
of
its
data
at
present
would
make
out
a
chronology
something

the
prophetic
spirit
found
a
voice
through
and
it
was
during
the
era
of
assyrian

babylonian
invasion
that
the
predictions
of
a
messiah
a

was
finished
in

led
home
a
larger
body
the
newly
returned
jews
were
fired
with
a
zeal
for
the
observance
of
the
mosaic
ritual
a
zeal
which
had
been
sharpened
in
the
persecutions
and
sorrows
of
exile
the
era
of
the
hagiocracy
of
the
supreme
influence
of
the

and
the
rigid
adherence
to
the
law
with
an
inflexible
hostility
to
heathen
customs
ensued
the
spirit
of
which
prophecy
had
been
the
stimulant
and
partially
the
fruit
declined
the
political
independence
of
the

was
gone
for
ever
the
day
of
freedom
under
the
after
the
insurrection
led
by
that
family
against
the
syrian
successors
of
alexander
was
short
but
israel
had
been
thrown
into
the
stream
of
nations
its
religious
influence
was
to
expand
as
its
political
strength
dwindled
its
subjugation
and
all
its
terrible
misfortunes
were
to
serve
as
a
means
of
spreading
the
leavening
influence

monotheistic
faith

the
literature
of
the
hebrews
is
essentially
religious
in
its
whole
motive
and
spirit
this
is
true
even
of
their
historical
writings
the
marks
of
the
one
defining
characteristic
of
their
national
life
faith
in
jehovah
and
in
his
sovereign
and
righteous
control
are
everywhere
seen
hebrew
poetry
is
mainly
lyrical
relics
of
old
songs
are
scattered
through
the

an

the

poesy
attains
to
its

flight

are
the

books
like

composed
mainly
of

nowhere
save
in

does
the
spirit
of
the
hebrew
religion
and
the
genius
of
the
people
find
an
expression
so
grand
and
moving
as
in
the
of
whom
is
the
chief
in
art
the
hebrews
did
not
excel
the
plastic
arts
were
generally
developed
in
connection
with
religion
but
the
religion
of
the
hebrews
excluded
all
visible
representations
of
deity
nor
were
they
proficients
in

israel
was
the
vessel
in

the
water
of
life
was
inclosed
in
which
it
was
kept
cool
and
pure
that
it
might
thereafter
refresh
the
world
the

comprise
first
the
which
describes
the
origin
of
the
hebrew
people
the

from

and
the

questions
pertaining
to
the
date
and
authorship
of
these
five
books
and
of
the
materials
at
the
basis
of
them
are
still
debated
among
historical
critics
it
may
be
regarded
as
certain
however
that
materials
belonging
to
nearly
every
period
of
hebrew
literature
from
the
earliest
times
are
here
combined
the
early
part
of
genesis
is
designed
to
explain
the
genealogy
of
the
hebrews
and
to
show
how
step
by
step
they
were
sundered
from
other
peoples
the
narratives
in
the
first
ten
chapters
as
the
story
of
the
creation
the
flood
so
strikingly
resemble
legends
of
other
semitic
nations
especially
the
as
to
make
it
plain
that
all
these
groups
of
accounts
are
historically
connected
with
one
another
but
the
genesis
narratives
are
distinguished
by
their
freedom
from
the
polytheistic
ingredients
which
disfigure
the
corresponding
narratives
elsewhere
they
are
on
the
elevated
plane
of
that
pure
theism
which
is
the
kernel
of
the
hebrew
faith
this
whole
subject

it

the
fragment

the
bactrian
religion
differed
from
that
of
their
kindred
on
the
indus
in
being
a
form
of
dualism
it
grew
out
of
a
belief
in
good
demons

spirits

in
evil
spirits
making
up
two
hosts
perpetually
in
conflict
with
each

host

in
the
zoroastrian
creed

the
creator
and
the
god

evil
host

the
god

all
that
is

the
one
is
disposed
to
bless
man
the
other
to
do
him
harm
the
conflict
of
virtue
and
vice
in
man
is
a
contest
for
control
on
the
part
of
these
antagonistic
powers
in
order
to
keep
off
the
spirits
of
evil
one
must
avoid
what
is
morally
or
ceremonially
unclean
he
who
lived
pure
went

the

soul
departed
to
consort

the
in

system
is
the
equal
though
the
creature
of
mithra
is
the
conqueror
of
darkness
and
so
the
enemy

the

of

held
sacred
as
was
also
the

the

in
the

sacrifices
were
less
prominent
than
in
india

and
the
iteration
of
prayers
were
of
great
moment
the
the
zoroastrian
religion
was
not
the
same
at

times

in
every
place
the
primitive
iranian
emigrants
were
monotheistic
in
their
tendencies
in
their
western
abodes
they
came
into
contact
with
worshipers
of
the
elements
fire
air
earth
and
water
it
is
thought
by
many
scholars
that
the
system
with
its
more
defined
dualism
and
sacerdotal
sway
was
ingrafted
on
the
native
religion
of
the
iranians
through
the
influence
of
tribes
with
whom
they
mingled
in
media
the
magi
according
to
one
account
were
charged
by
darius
with
corrupting
the
zoroastrian
faith
and
worship
whatever
may
have
been
their
origin
they
became
the
leaders
in
worship
and
to
the
sovereign
they
were
likewise
astrologers
and
interpreters
of
dreams
they
were
not
so
distinct
a
class
as
the
priests
in
india
a
hereditary
order
they
might
still
bring
new
members
into
their
ranks
from
the
medes
they
were
introduced
among
the
persians
persian
religious
peculiar
customs
existed
among
the
medes
in
disposing
of
the
dead
they
were
not
to
be
cast
into
the
fire
or
the
water
or
buried
in
the
earth
for
this
would
bring
pollution
to
what
was
sacred
but
their
bodies
were
to
be
exposed
in
the
high
rocks
where
the
beasts
and
birds
could
devour
them
sacrifices
were
offered
on
salutations
of
homage
were
made
to
the
rising
sun
on
some
occasions
boys
were
buried
alive
as
an
offering
to
the
divinities
in
early
times
there
were
no
images
of
the
gods
as
far
as
they
were
introduced
in
later
times
it
was
through
the
influence
of
surrounding
nations
in
the
supremacy
and
the
final
victory
which
in
the
later
form
of
zoroastrianism
were
accorded
to
there
was
again
an
approach
to
monotheism
hostility
to
deception
of
all
sorts
and
thus
to
stealing
was
a
persian
trait
says
that
the
persians
taught
their
children
to
ride
to
shoot
the
bow
and
to
speak
the
truth
to
prize
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
and
horticulture
was
a
part
of
their
religion
they
allowed
a
plurality
of
wives
and
concubines
with
them
but
there
was
one
wife
to
whom
precedence
belonged
voluntary
celibacy

gained
the
supremacy
the
leader
of
the
persian
revolt
by
whom
was
defeated
is
described
as
related
to
him
but
this
story
as
well
as
the
account
of
his
being
rescued
from
death
and
brought
up
among
shepherds
is
probably
a
fiction
in
the
sixth
century
this
famous
ruler
and
conqueror
became
the
founder
of
an
empire
which
comprised
nearly
all
the
civilized
nations
of
asia
during
his
reign
of
thirty
years
he
annexed
to
his
kingdom
the
two
principal
states
lydia
and
babylon
the
king
of
lydia
was
whose
story
embellished
with
romantic
details
was
long
familiar
as
a
signal
example
of
the
mutations
of
fortune
doomed
to
be
burned
after
the
capture
of
his
capital
he
was
heard
just
when
the
fire
was
to
be
kindled
to
say
something
about
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
of
cyrus
whose
curiosity
was
excited
he
related
how
that
grecian
sage
after
beholding
his
treasures
had
refused
to
call
him
the
most
fortunate
of
men
on
the
ground
that
no
man
can
be
called
happy
before
his
death
because
none
can
tell
what
disasters
may
befall
him
cyrus
according
to
the
narrative
touched
by
the
tale
delivered
croesus
from
death
and
thereafter
bestowed
on
him
honor
and
confidence
there
is
another
form
of
the
tradition
which
is
deemed
by
some
more
probable
croesus
is
said
to
have
stood
on
a
pyre
intending
to
offer
himself
in
the
flames
to
propitiate
the
god
that
his
people
might
be
saved
from
destruction
but
he
was
prevented
it
is
said
by
unfavorable
auguries
the
subjection
of
the
greek
colonies
on
the
coast
followed
upon
the
subjugation
of
lydia
from
these
colonies
the
went
forth
and
founded
in
lower
italy
and
massilia
marseilles
in
gaul
the
asian
greek
cities
were
each
allowed
its
own
municipal
rulers
but
paid
tribute
to
the
persian
master
the
conquest
of
as
it
opened
the
way
for
the
return
to
jerusalem
of
the
jewish
exiles
enabled
cyrus
to
establish
a
friendly
people
in
judaea
as
a
help
in
fortifying
his
sway
in
syria
and
in
opening
a
path
to
but
in
he
lost
his
life
in
a
war
which
he
was
waging
against
the
a
tribe
on
the
caspian
allied
in
blood
to
the
scythians
there
was
a
tradition
that
the
barbarian
queen
enraged
that
cyrus
had
overcome
her
son
by
deceit
dipped
the
slain
king
head
in
a
of
blood
exclaiming
drink
thy
fill
of
blood
of
which
thou
couldst
not
have
enough
in
thy
lifetime
the
successor
of
cyrus
a
man
not
less
warlike
than
he
but
more
violent
in
his
passions
reigned
but
seven
years
his
most
conspicuous
achievement
was
the
conquest
of
egypt
one
ground
or
pretext
of
his
hostility
according
to
the
tale
of
herodotus
was
the
fact
that
amasis
the
predecessor
of
not
daring
to
refuse
the
demand
of
his
daughter
as
a
wife
to
be
second
in
rank
to
the
persian
queen
had
fraudulently
sent
either
to
cambyses
or
before
his
time
to
cyrus
the
daughter
of
the
king
who
preceded
him
apries
defeated
at
and
compelled
to
yield
up
after
a
siege
it
is
said
that
psammeticus
the
of
herodotus
the
unfortunate
successor
of
the
powerful
pharaohs
was
obliged
to
look
on
the
spectacle
of
his
daughters
in
the
garb
of
bearing
water
and
to
see
his
sons
with
the
principal
young
nobles
ordered
to
execution
but
this
tale
lacks
confirmation
his
cruelties
were
probably
of
a
later
date
and
were
provoked
by
the
chagrin
he
felt
and
the
satisfaction
manifested
by
the
people
at
the
failure
of
great
expeditions
which
he
sent
southward
for
the
conquest
of
and
westward
against
the
of
his
armies
perished
in
the
lybian
deserts
even
the
story
of
his
stabbing
the
sacred
steer
after
these
events
although
it
may
be
true
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
egyptian
inscriptions
his
attack
upon
ammon
probably
arose
in
part
at
least
from
a
desire
to
possess
himself
of
whatever
lay
between
egypt
and
the
carthaginian
territory
but
the
phoenician
sailors
who
manned
his
fleet
refused
to
sail
against
their
brethren
in
carthage
assumed
the
title
and
character
of
an
egyptian
sovereign
the
story
of
his
madness
is
an
invention
of
the
egyptian
priests
darius
for
a
short
time
a
pretender
a
magian
who
called
himself
and
professed
to
be
the
brother
of
cambyses
usurped
the
throne
cambyses
is
said
to
have
put
an
end
to
his
own
life
after
a
reign
of
seven
months
during
which
he
kept
himself
for
the
most
part
hidden
from
view
smerdis
was
destroyed
by
a
rising
of
the
leading
persian
families
darius
the
son
of
hystaspes
of
the
royal
race
of
the
succeeded
he
married
the
daughter
of
cyrus
the
countries
which
composed
an
oriental
empire
were
so
loosely
held
together
that
the
death
of
a
despot
or
the
change
of
a
dynasty
was
very
likely
to
call
forth
a
general
insurrection
darius
showed
his
military
prowess
in
conquering
anew
various
countries
including
babylon
which
had
revolted
he
made
arabia
tributary
and
spread
the
bounds
of
his
vast
empire
as
far
as
india
and
in
north
africa
a
mighty
expedition
which
he
organized
against
the
scythians
on
the
lower
danube
failed
of
the
results
that
were
hoped
from
it
the
barbarians
wasted
their
own
fields
filled
up
their
wells
drove
off
their
cattle
and
fled
as
the
army
of
darius
advanced
he
returned
however
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
intact
although
with
a
loss
of
prestige
and
enrolled
the
scyths
beyond
the
sea
among
the
subjects
of
his
empire
his
armies
conquered
the
tribes
of
so
that
he
pushed
his
boundaries
to
the
frontiers
of
macedonia
the
rebellion
of
the
greek
cities
on
the
coast
he
suppressed
and
harshly
avenged
of
his
further
conflicts
with
the
greeks
on
the
mainland
more
is
to
be
said
hereafter
he
had
built
but
his
principal
seat
of
government
appears
to
have
been
he
did
a
great
work
in
organizing
his
imperial
system
the
division
into
large
districts
each
under
a
or
viceroy
was
a
part
of
this
work
he
thus
introduced
a
more
efficient
and
methodical
administration
into
his
empire
an
empire
four
times
as
large
as
the
empire
of
assyria
which
it
had
swallowed
up
persia
proper
corresponded
nearly
to
the
modern
province
of
or
the
persian
empire
stretched
from
east
to
west
for
a
distance
of
about
three
thousand
miles
and
was
from
five
hundred
to
fifteen
hundred
miles
in
width
it
was
more
than
half
as
large
as
modern
europe
it
comprised
not
less
than
two
millions
of
square
miles
its
population
under
darius
may
have
been
seventy
or
eighty
millions
he
brought
in
uniformity
of
administration
in
each
satrapy
besides
the
satrap
himself
who
was
a
despot
within
his
own
dominion
there
was
at
first
a
commander
of
the
troops
and
a
secretary
whose
business
it
was
to
make
reports
to
the
great
king
these
three
officers
were
really
watchmen
over
one
another
it
was
through
spies
eyes
and
ears
of
the
king
that
he
was
kept
informed
of
what
was
taking
place
in
every
part
of
the
empire
at
length
it
was
found
necessary
to
give
the
satraps
the
command
of
the
troops
which
took
away
one
important
check
upon
their
power
there
was
a
regular
system
of
taxation
but
to
this
were
added
extraordinary
and
oppressive
levies
darius
introduced
a
uniform
coinage
the
name
of
the
coin
daric
is
probably
not
derived
from
his
name
however
notwithstanding
the
government
by
satraps
local
laws
and
usages
were
left
to
a
large
extent
undisturbed
great
roads
and
postal
communication
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
government
connected
the
capital
with
the
distant
provinces
in
this
point
the
persians
set
an
example
which
was
followed
by
the
romans
from
to
a
distance
of
about
seventeen
hundred
english
miles
stretched
a
road
along
which
at
proper
intervals
were
caravansaries
and
over
which
the
fleet
couriers
of
the
king
rode
in
six
or
seven
days
the
king
was
an
absolute
lord
and
master
who
disposed
of
the
lives
and
property
of
his
subjects
without
restraint
to
him
the
most
servile
homage
was
paid
he
lived
mostly
in
seclusion
in
his
palace
on
great
occasions
he
sat
at
banquet
with
his
nobles
his
throne
was
made
of
gold
silver
and
ivory
all
who
approached
him
kissed
the
earth
his
ordinary
dress
was
probably
of
the
richest
silk
he
took
his
meals
mostly
by
himself
his
fare
was
made
up
of
the
choicest
delicacies
his
seraglio
guarded
by
eunuchs
contained
a
multitude
of
inmates
brought
together
by
his
arbitrary
command
over
whom
in
a
certain
way
the
presided
his
chief
diversions
were
playing
at
dice
within
doors
and
hunting

with
trees
and
shrubbery
and
furnished
with
refreshing
fountains
and
streams
were
his
such
inclosures
were
the
delight
of
all
persians
in

he
was
attended
with
various
officers
in
close
attendance
on

was

on
the
celerity

the
weight
of
their
numbers
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
employed
military
engines
they
were
not

began
the
career
which
made

a
maritime
and
commercial
people
the
crossed
over
to
the
highlands
of
northern
greece
where
they
became
hardy
mountaineers
not
addicted
to
the
sea
the
one
tribe
were
to
be
eventually
the
founders
of
the
other

besides
these
two
main
tribes
the
occupied
thessaly
boeotia
aetolia
and
other
districts
to
them
the
who
were
supreme
in
peloponnesus
in
the
days
of
homer
were
allied
foreign
besides
phrygia
the
legends
of
the
greeks
bear
traces
of
a
foreign
influence
from
and
the
phoenicians
were
unquestionably
early
connected
with
the
greeks
first
by
commercial
visits
to
greek
ports
to
which
they
brought
foreign
merchandise
the
story
of
who
is
said
to
have
founded
and
to
have
brought
in
the
phoenician
alphabet
is
fabulous
but
it
is
probable
that
as
early
as
the
close
of
the
ninth
century
the
was
introduced
by
phoenicians
and
diffused
over
greece
another
legend
is
that
of
conceived
of
later
as
an
egyptian
who
is
said
to
have
built
a
citadel
at
athens
and
to
have
imported
the
seeds
of
civilization
and
religion
another
emigrant
from
egypt
coming
with
his
fifty
daughters
is
said
to
have
built
the
citadel
of
in
the
later
times
the
greeks
were
fond
of
tracing
their
knowledge
of
the
arts
to
egyptian
sources
it
is
remarkable
that
the
agents
by
whom
germs
of
civilization
were
said
to
have
been
imported
from
abroad
though
foreign
are
nevertheless
depicted
as
thoroughly
greek
in
their
character
whatever
the
greeks
may
have
owed
to
egypt
it
is
probable
was
mainly
derived
from
ionians
who
had
previously
planted
themselves
in
that
country
the
dorian
it
was
in
the
prehistoric
time
that
the
dorians
left
their
homes
in
northern
greece
and
migrated
into
peloponnesus
where
they
proved
themselves
stronger
than
the
ionians
and
the
achaeans
dwelling
there
they
left
the
achaeans
on
the
south
coast
of
the
corinthian
gulf
in
the
district
called
achaia
nor
did
they
conquer
arcadia
but
of
most
of
peloponnesus
they
became
masters
this
is
the
portion
of
historic
truth
contained
in
the
myth
of
the
of
the
the
descendants
of
hercules
to
the
old
kingdom
of
their
ancestor
migrations
to
asia
the
dorian
conquest
is
said
to
have
been
the
cause
of
three
distinct
migrations
to
asia
minor
the
achaeans
with
their
aeolic
kinsmen
on
the
north
established
themselves
on
the
coast
of
asia
minor
and
being
their
strongholds
and
by
degrees
got
control
in
and
the
ionic
emigrants
from
attica
joined
their
brethren
on
the
same
coast
the
dorians
settled
on
the
coast
they
also
settled
and
and
at
length
subdued
the
dorian
conquest
of
peloponnesus
and
the
migrations
just
spoken
of
were
slow
in
their
progress
and
possibly
stretched
over
centuries
character
of
the
is
a
distinguishing
trait
of
the
greeks
whatever
they
borrowed
from
others
they
made
their
own
and
reproduced
in
a
form
peculiar
to
themselves
they
were
never
servile
copyists
all
the
products
of
the
greek
mind
whether
in
government
art
literature
or
in
whatever
province
of
human
activity
wear
a
peculiar
stamp
when
we
leave
asiatic
ground
and
come
into
contact
with
the
greeks
we
find
ourselves
in
another
atmosphere
a
spirit
of
humanity
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
term
pervades
their
life
a
regard
for
reason
a
sense
of
order
a
disposition
to
keep
every
thing
within
measure
is
a
marked
characteristic
their
sense
of
form
including
a
perception
of
beauty
and
of
harmony
and
proportion
made
them
in
politics
and
letters
the
leaders
of
mankind
do
nothing
in
excess
was
their
favorite
maxim
they
hated
every
thing
that
was
out
of
proportion
their
language
without
a
rival
in
flexibility
and
symmetry
and
in
perfection
of
sound
is
itself
though
a
spontaneous
creation
a
work
of
art
the
whole
language
resembles
the
body
of
an
artistically
trained
athlete
in
which
every
muscle
every
sinew
is
developed
into
full
play
where
there
is
no
trace
of
tumidity
or
of
inert
matter
and
all
is
power
and
life
the
great
variety
of
the
spiritual
gifts
of
this
people
the
severest
formulas
of
science
the
loftiest
flights
of
imagination
the
keenest
play
of
wit
and
humor
were
capable
of
precise
and
effective
expression
in
this
language
as
in
ductile
play
the
use
of
the
language
so
lucid
and
so
nice
in
its
discriminations
was
itself
an
education
for
the
young
who
grew
up
to
hear
it
and
to
speak
it
in
a
genial
yet
invigorating
climate
in
a
land
where
breezes
from
the
mountain
and
the
sea
were
mingled
the
versatile
greeks
produced
by
physical
training
that
vigor
and
grace
of
body
which
they
so
much
admired
and
they
developed
the
civil
polity
the
artistic
discernment
and
the
complex
social
life
which
made
them
the
principal
source
of
modern
culture
their
moral
traits
are
not
so
admirable
as
a
race
they
were
less
truthful
and
less
marked
for
their
courage
and
loyalty
than
some
other
peoples
below
them
in
intellect
in
the
early
days
when
greece
was
open
to
foreign
influences
the
simple
religion
of
the
aryan
fathers
was
enlarged
by
new
elements
from
abroad
the
tyrian
deity
melkart

at

legends
of
the
space
which
precedes
the
beginning
of
authentic
records
the
greeks
filled
up
with
mythical
tales
in
which
gods
and
heroes
are
the
central
figures
the
heroes
are
partly
of
divine
parentage
they
are
in
near
intercourse
with
the
deities
their
deeds
are
superhuman
and
embody
those
ideals
of
character
and
of
achievement
which
the
early
greeks
cherished
the
production
of
a
lively
imagination
before
the
dawn
of
the
critical
faculty
or
the
growth
of
reflection
these
tales
may
yet
include
a
nucleus
of
historical
incident
or
vague
reminiscences
of
historical
relations
and
changes
to
attempt
to
extract
these
from
the
fictitious
form
in
which
they
are
embodied
is
for
the
most
part
hopeless
the
exploits
of
hercules
have
a
prominent
place
in
the
legends
this
hero
of
argos
submitted
to
serve
a
cruel
tyrant
but
by
prodigious
labors
twelve
in
number
delivered
men
from
dangerous
beasts
the
lernaean
hydra
the
nemean

and
performed
other
miraculous
services
the
national
hero
of

founded
a
maritime
state
of
the
legendary
stories
three
of
the
most
famous
are
seven
against
thebes
the
argonautic
and
trojan
i
king
of
thebes
was
told
by
an
oracle
that
he
should
be
killed
by
his
son
he
exposed
him
therefore
as
soon
as
he
was
born
on
mount
cithaeron
saved
by
a
herdsman
oedipus
was
brought
up
by
polybus
king
of
corinth
as
his
own
son
warned
by
the
oracle
that
he
should
kill
his
father
and
marry
his
mother
the
son
forsook
corinth
and
made
his
abode
at
thebes
meeting
laius
in
a
narrow
pass
and
provoked
by
his
attendants
he
slew
them
and
him
at
thebes
there
was
a
female
monster
the
sphinx
who
propounded
a
riddle
and
each
day
devoured
a
man
until
it
should
be
solved
oedipus
won
the
prize
which
the
queen
had
offered
namely
the
crown
and
her
own
hand
to
whomsoever
should
free
the
city
when
his
two
sons
and
daughters
had
grown
up
a
pestilence
broke
out
and
the
oracle
demanded
that
the
murderer
of
laius
should
be
banished
oedipus
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
the
blind
priest
finds
out
the
truth
he
puts
out
his
eyes
and
is
driven
into
exile
by
his
sons
whom
he
curses
under
the
guidance
of
his
daughter
he
finds
a
at
a
suburb
of
athens
in
a
grove
of
the
whose
function
it
was
to
avenge
such
crimes
as
his
he
received
expiation
at
the
hands
of
and
died
in
a
calm
and
peaceful
way
this
legend
was
the
basis
of
some
of
the
finest
of
the
greek
dramas
oedipus
tyrannus
and
the
oedipus
at
colonus
of
and
the
seven
against
thebes
of
the
curse
of
oedipus
still
rested
on
his
sons
the
story
of
defying
the
tyrant
and
burying
her
slain
brother
is
the
foundation
of
the
drama
of
bearing
her
name
finally
the
descendants
of
the
seven
who
had
fought
thebes
captured
and
destroyed
that
city
were
described
as
a
band
of
heroes
who
through
perilous
and
unknown
seas
sailed
from
iolcos
in
thessaly
in
the
ship
argo
to
colchis
whence
they
brought
away
the
golden
fleece
which
had
been
stolen
and
which
they
found
nailed
to
an
oak
and
guarded
by
a
sleepless
dragon
the
leader
was
accompanied
on
his
return
by
the
enchantress
who
had
aided
him
she
in
order
to
delay
their
pursuers
killed
her
brother
and
threw
his
body
piece
by
piece
into
the
sea
her
subsequent
story
involves
various
other
tragic
events
the
most
noted
of
the
legends
is
the
story
of
the
trojan
war
the
deeds
of
the
heroes
of
this
war
are
the
subject
of
the
son
of
priam
king
of
troy
in
asia
minor
carried
off
the
wife
of
king
of
sparta
to
recover
her
the
greeks
united
in
an
expedition
against
troy
which
they
took
after
a
siege
of
ten
years
agamemnon
achilles
odysseus
ulysses
ajax
son
of
telamon
and
ajax
son
of
oileus
diomedes
and
nestor
were
among
the
chiefs
on
the
greek
side
troy
had
its
allies
the
odyssey
relates
to
the
long
journey
of
on
his
return
to
ithaca
his
home
that
there
was
an
ancient
city
troy
is
certain
a
conflict
between
the
greeks
and
a
kindred
people
there
is
probable
not
unlikely
there
was
a
military
expedition
of
grecian
tribes
every
thing
beyond
this
is
either
plainly
myth
or
incapable
of
verification
unions
of
during
the
period
when
the
greek
population
was
dispersing
itself
in
the
districts
which
its
different
fractions
occupied
in
the
historic
ages
there
arose
unions
among
tribes
near
one
another
for
religious
purposes
they
preceded
treaties
and
alliances
of
the
ordinary
kind
such
tribes
agreed
to
celebrate
in
common
certain
solemn
festivals
deputies
of
these
tribes
met
at
stated
intervals
to
look
after
the
temple
and
the
lands
pertaining
to
it
out
of
these
unions
there
grew
stipulations
relative
to
the
mode
of
conducting
war
and
other
matters
of
common
interest
treaties
of
peace
and
of
mutual
defense
might
follow
thus
arose
combinations
of
states
in
which
one
state
the
strongest
would
have
the
or
lead
this
became
an
established
characteristic
of
greek
political
life
it
was
a
system
of
federal
unions
under
the
headship
of
the
most
powerful
member
of
the
confederacy
when
such
a
union
was
formed
it
established
a
common
worship
or
festival
the
delphic
in
the
north
of
greece
there
was
formed
in
early
times
a
great
religious
union
it
was
composed
of
twelve
tribes
banded
together
for
the
worship
of
at
and
to
guard
his
temple
it
was
called
the
delphic
amphictyony
or
league
of
neighbors
the
members
of
this
body
agreed
not
to
destroy
one
another
towns
in
war
and
not
to
cut
off
running
water
from
a
town
which
they
were
besieging
the
delphic
the
sanctuary
at
delphi
where
the
amphictyonic
council
met
became
the
most
famous
temple
in
greece
here
the
oracle
of
apollo
gave
answers
to
those
who
came
to
consult
that
divinity
the
priests
who
managed
the
temple
kept
themselves
well
informed
in
regard
to
occurrences
in
distant
places
their
answers
were
often
discreet
and
wholesome
but
not
unfrequently
obscure
and
ambiguous
and
thus
misleading
in
early
times
their
moral
influence
in
the
nation
promoted
justice
and
fraternal
feeling
in
later
times
they
lost
their
reputation
for
honesty
and
impartiality
in
civil
wars
the
priests
were
sometimes
bribed
to
support
one
of
the
contending
parties
the
homeric
within
the
last
century
there
has
been
much
discussion
about
the
authorship
of
the
two
poems
the
and
the
the
place
where
they
were
composed
whether
among
the
ionians
in
greece
proper
or
in
asia
minor
is
still
a
matter
of
debate
it
was
probably
asia
minor
seven
places
contended
for
the
honor
of
having
given
birth
to
the
blind
bard
but
nothing
is
known
of
homer
birthplace
or
history
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
art
of
writing
was
much
if
at
all
in
use
among
the
greeks
at
the
time
of
the
composition
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
we
know
that
the
custom
existed
of
repeating
poems
orally
by
minstrels
or
at
popular
festivals
this
may
have
been
the
mode
in
which
for
a
time
the
homeric
poems
were
preserved
and
transmitted
the
odyssey
has
more
unity
than
the
iliad
and
seems
to
be
of
a
somewhat
later
date
the
nucleus
of
the
iliad
is
thought
by
some
scholars
to
be
embedded
in
the
group
of
poems
which
it
is
supposed
constitute
the
work
at
present
but
there
is
no
evidence
making
it
possible
to
identify
any
portion
as
the
work
of
homer
whatever
may
be
the
truth
on
these
questions
the
iliad
and
odyssey
present
an
invaluable
picture
of
greek
life
in
the
period
when
they
were
composed
which
was
probably
as
early
as
social
life
in
the
homeric
in
the
homeric
portraiture
of
greek
life
there
are
towns
but
the
tribe
is
predominant
over
the
town
the
tribe
is
ruled
by
a
king
who
is
not
like
an
eastern
despot
but
has
about
him
a
council
of
chiefs
and
is
bound
by
the
the
traditional
customs
there
is
besides
the
or
popular
assembly
where
debates
take
place
among
the
chiefs
and
to
which
their
decisions
or
rather
the
decision
of
the
king
on
whom
it
devolves
finally
to
determine
every
thing
are
communicated
public
speaking
it
is
seen
is
practiced
in
the
infancy
of

established
side

with

and

and
the
supreme
honor
given
to

prowess
there
is
a
fine
and
bountiful
hospitality
which
is
held
to
be
a
religious
duty
in
the
homeric
poems
there
is
often
exhibited
a
noble
refinement
of

and
sentiment
and
a
gentle
courtesy

the

give
us
a
full
idea
of
the
early
religious
ideas
and
practices
i
nature
of
the
the
gods
in
homer
are
human
beings
with
greatly
magnified
powers
their
dwelling
is
in
the
sky
above
us
their
special
abode
is
mount
olympus
they
experience
hunger
but
feed
on
ambrosia
and
nectar
they
travel
with
miraculous
speed
their
prime
blessing
is
exemption
from
mortality
among
themselves
they
are
often
discordant

deceitful
of
the

they
are
the

they
act
often
from

caprice

favoritism
their
sway
is
on
the
whole
promotive
of
justice
zeus
is
supreme
none
can
contend
with
him
successfully
the
gods
hold
communication
with
men
they
also
make
known
their
will
and
intentions
by
signs
and
portents
such
as
thunder

the

teach
men
through

of
the
sacrifice
and
supplication
are
the
chief
forms
of
devotion
there
is
no
dominant
hierarchy

sacred

abhorred
by

as
by

conduct

are
found
abundant
examples
of
unbridled
anger
and
savage
retaliation
yet
gentle
sentiments
counsels
to
forbearance
and
mercy
are
not
wanting
the
wrath
of
the
gods
is
most
provoked
by
lawless
and
insolence
the
the
sense
of
sin
leads
to
the
appeasing
of
the

lyrical
in
the
eighth
century
when
monarchy
was
declining
and
the
tendency
to
democracy
began
to
manifest
itself
a
new
style
of
poetry
different
from
the
epic
arose
the
narrative
poems
of
minstrels
were
heard
at
the
great
religious
festivals
but
there
was
a
craving
for
the
expression
of
individual
feeling
hence
lyrical
poetry
not
in
the
shape
of
religious
songs
as
in
the
old
time
but
in
a
form
to
touch
all
the
chords
of
sentiment
two
new
types
of
verse
appeared
the
and
the
at
first
the
elegy
was
probably
a
lament
for
the
dead
it
was
accompanied
by
the
soft
music
of
the
lydian
flute
the
instruments
which
the
greeks
had
used
were
the
early
greek
elegies
related
to
a
variety
of
themes
as
war
love
preceptive
wisdom
the
iambic
meter
was
first
used
in
satire
its
earliest
master
of
distinction
was
of
paros
it
was
employed
however
in
fables
and
elsewhere
when
pointed
or
intense
expression
was
craved
the
earliest
of
the
greek
elegists
and
composed
solon
theognis
of
are
among
the
most
famous
elegists
music
developed
in
connection
with
lyric
poetry
the
greeks
at
first
used
the
lyre
terpander
made
an
epoch
by
adding
three
strings
and
made
further
improvements
greek
lyric
poetry
flourished
especially
from
to
the
aeolian
lyrists
of
founded
a
school
of
their
own
the
two
great
representatives
are
who
sang
of
war
and
of
love
and
who
sang
of
love
probably
no
poet
ever
surpassed
sappho
as
an
interpreter
of
passion
in
exquisitely
subtle
harmonies
of
form
and
sound
an
ionian
resembled
in
his
style
the
aeolian
lyrists
he
was
most
often
referred
to
by
the
ancients
as
the
poet
of
sensuous
feeling
of
every
sort
the
lyric
poetry
was
mostly
choral
and
historic
in
its
topics
greek
lyric
poetry
reaches
the
climax
in
and
the
latter
was
a
boeotian
but
of
dorian
descent
was
tender
and
polished
fervid
and
sublime
the
extant
works
of
pindar
are
the
or
odes
of
victory
historical
this
age
witnesses
the
beginnings
of
historical
writing
but
the
as
they
were
called
only
wrote
prose
epics
they
told
the
story
of
the
foundation
of
families
and
cities
reconciling
as
best
they
could
the
myths
so
far
as
they
clashed
with
one
another
philosophy
the
ionian
the
greeks
were
the
first
to
investigate
rationally
the
causes
of
things
and
to
try
to
comprehend
the
world
as
a
complete
system
the
earliest
phase
of
this
movement
was
on
the
side
of
physics
or
natural
philosophy
and
had
accounted
for
the
operations
of
nature
by
referring
them
to
the
direct
personal
action
of
different
divinities
the
earliest
philosophers
brought
in
the
conception
of
some
kind
of
matter
as
the
foundation
and
source
of
all
things
the

direction
of

the

conceived
of

as

in

and
held
that
the

which
we
behold
in

are
unreal

to
vindicate
this

logically
by
disproving

this

itself
a

spirit
in

belonged
to
who
was
born
in
samos
traveled
extensively
and
settled
in
croton
in
southern
italy
his
theory
was
that
the
inner
substance
of
all
things
is
number
discipline
of
character
was
a
prime
object
pythagoras
was
sparing
in
his
diet
promoted
an
earnest
culture
in
which
music
was
prominent
and
gave
rise
to
a
mystical
school
in
which
moral
reform
and
religious
fueling
were
connected
with
an
ascetic
method
of
living
it
was
during
the
era
of
the
oligarchies
and
tyrannies
that
the
colonizing
spirit
was
most
active
among
the
greeks
most
of
the
colonies
were
established
between

their
names
alone
would
make
a
very
long
catalogue
they
were
of
two
classes
first
connected
however
with
the
parent
city
by
close
ties
of
friendship
and
secondly
which
were
of
the
nature
of
garrisons
where
the
settlers
retained
their
former
rights
as
citizens

partly
in

of
a
struggle
with

friendly

still
more
on

of
an
earthquake

laid

of

so
crippled
as
not
to
be
able
to
check

progress
of
the
rival
community
she
was
even
obliged
to
invoke
athenian
help
against
the
revolting
messenians
and

but
after
the
troops
of
athens
had
joined
them
the
spartans
jealous
and
afraid
of
what
they
might
do
sent
them
back
this
indignity
led
to

of
who
had
favored
the
sending
of

and
to
the
granting
of

to

the
spartans
now
did
their
best
to

of

by
raising

cities
everywhere

was
the
champion
of
the

the

at

induced

to
recall

a
worthy
citizen
two
months
after

was
defeated
by
and
the
athenians
became
masters
of

brought
about
a
truce
between
athens
and
sparta
he
left
his
country
on
a
high
pinnacle
of
power
and
dominion
nearly
all
the
allies
in
the
confederacy
of
delos
had
fallen
into
the
position
of
tributaries
whose
heavy
contributions
were
carried
no
longer
to
the
sanctuary
at
delos
but
to
the
temple
of
athena
on
the
acropolis
and
who
had
no
power
to
decide
on
questions
of
peace
and
war
the
nobles
however
who
were
driven
into
exile
in
all
conquered
places
were
the
mortal
enemies
of
athens
at
the
boeotian
refugees
and
aristocrats
were
so
strong
that
the
athenians
experienced
a
disastrous
defeat
the
peril
of
the
situation
moved
to
secure
by
astute
management
a
peace
with
sparta
the
terms
of
which
were
that
each
of
the
two
cities
was
to
maintain
its
hegemony
within
its
own
circle
and
the
several
states
were
to
attach
themselves
at
their
option
to
either
confederacy
in
market
and
harbor
there
was
to
be
a
free
intercourse
of
trade
the
age
of
pericles
belonged
to
one
of
the
principal
athenian
families
but
was
democratic
in
his
politics
and
made
himself
a
popular
leader
by
his
influence
the
was
stripped
of
high
prerogatives
that
had
belonged
to
it
he
caused
it
to
be
enacted
that
every
citizen
when
engaged
in
the
public
service
even
in
attending
the
popular
assembly
should
receive
a
stipend
for
fifteen
years
as
the
first
citizen
of
athens
with
none
of
the
trappings
of
power
he
virtually
ruled
the
commonwealth
one
of
his
works
was
the
building
the
third
of
the
which
protected
the
and
the
neighboring
ports
on
the
land
side
and
connected
them
with
athens
his
patriotism
was
as
sincere
as
his
talents
were
versatile
and
brilliant
he
was
at
once
a
soldier
an
orator
a
statesman
of
consummate
ability
and
a
man
imbued
with
the
best
appreciation
of
letters
and
of
art
in
his
hospitable
house
where
from
miletus
a
beautiful
and
cultured
woman
was
his
companion
men
of
genius
found
a
welcome
under
him
athens
became
the
metropolis
of
literature
philosophy
and
art
for
the
whole
hellenic
race
and
considering
the
influence
of
athens
it
might
almost
be
said
for
mankind
in
all
ages
magnificent
buildings
of
which
the
the
temple
of
athena
that
crowned
the
acropolis
whose
ruins
are
the
model
of
architectural
perfection
was
one
gave
to
the
city
an
unrivaled
beauty
vied
with
architecture
in
this
work
of
adornment
who
wrought
the
frieze
of
the
parthenon
counted
among
his
wonderful
creations
the
colossal
sitting
statue
of
zeus
at
olympia
it
was
the
blossoming
season
of
the
greek
intellect
as
regards
and
the
the
reached
its
perfection
in
the
masterly
tragedies
of
sophocles
and
and
in
the
comedies
of
the
athenian
community
through
its
political
eminence
its
intellectual
character
so
original
and
diversified
its
culture
such
that
almost
every
citizen
was
qualified
for
civil
office
has
no
parallel
in
history
it
is
the
elevation
not
of
a
select
class
of
the
citizens
but
of
the
whole
society
which
gives
to
athens
its
unique
distinction
public
spirit
and
enterprise
which
made
her
navy
dominant
in
the
aegean
and
over
the
of
asia
minor
went
hand
in
hand
with
delight
in
eloquence
and
in
the
creations
of
genius
there
was
not
however
as
some
have
affirmed
in
the
prevalent
absorption
in
the
affairs
of
state
a
neglect
of
the
labors
of
agriculture
and
of
mechanical
industry
the
acropolis
it
was
customary
for
a
greek
town
to
be
built
about
an
acropolis
an
eminence
by
which
it
was
commanded
and
on
which
stood
the
citadel
on
the
acropolis
at
athens
were
the
buildings
and
statues
in
which
the
glory
of
athenian
art
was
impressively
displayed
there
were
three
edifices
which
excelled
all
the
rest
in
splendor
on
the
south
side
of
the
elevated
area
was
the
built
of
pentelic
marble
two
hundred
and
feet
in
length
and
of
faultless
proportions
on
the
northern
edge
was
the
an
ionic
temple
of
extraordinary
beauty
the
approached
by
sixty
marble
steps
was
a
noble
gateway
it
stood
on
the
western
end
of
the
acropolis
which
it
magnificently
adorned
athens
no
other
description
of
athens
in
the
age
of
pericles
equals
his
own
in
the
as
given
by
thucydides
for
those
who
had
fallen
in
the
war
it
shows
how
an
athenian
looked
upon
his
city
it
is
true
that
we
are
called
a
democracy
for
the
administration
is
in
the
hands
of
the
many
and
not
of
the
few
but
while
the
law
secures
equal
justice
to
all
alike
in
their
private
disputes
the
claim
of
excellence
is
also
recognized
and
when
a
citizen
is
in
any
way
distinguished
he
is
preferred
to
the
public
service
not
as
a
matter
of
privilege
but
as
the
reward
of
merit
neither
is
poverty
a
bar
but
a
man
may
benefit
his
country
whatever
be
the
obscurity
of
his
condition
there
is
no
exclusiveness
in
our
public
life
and
in
our
private
intercourse
we
are
not
suspicious
of
one
another
nor
angry
with
our
neighbor
if
he
does
what
he
likes
we
do
not
put
on
sour
looks
at
him
which
though
harmless
are
not
pleasant
while
we
are
thus
unconstrained
in
our
private
intercourse
a
spirit
of
reverence
pervades
our
public
acts
we
are
prevented
from
doing
wrong
by
respect
for
authority
and
the
laws
having
an
especial
regard
to
those
which
are
ordained
for
the
protection
of
the
injured
as
well
as
to
those
unwritten
laws
which
bring
upon
the
transgressor
of
them
the
reprobation
of
the
general
sentiment
and
we
have
not
forgotten
to
provide
for
our
weary
spirits
many
relaxations
from
toil
we
have
regular
games
and
sacrifices
throughout
the
year
at
home
the
style
of
our
life
is
refined
and
the
delight
which
we
daily
feel
in
all
these
things
helps
to
banish
melancholy
because
of
the
greatness
of
our
city
the
fruits
of
the
whole
earth
flow
in
upon
us
so
that
we
enjoy
the
goods
of
other
countries
as
freely
as
of
our
own
then
again
our
military
training
is
in
many
respects
superior
to
that
of
our
adversaries
our
city
is
thrown
open
to
the
world
and
we
never
expel
a
foreigner
or
prevent
him
from
seeing
or
learning
any
thing
of
which
the
secret
if
revealed
to
an
enemy
might
profit
him
we
rely
not
upon
management
or
trickery
but
upon
our
own
hearts
and
hands
and
in
the
matter
of
education
whereas
they
from
early
youth
are
always
undergoing
laborious
exercises
which
are
to
make
them
brave
we
live
at
ease
and
yet
are
equally
ready
to
face
the
perils
which
they
face
and
here
is
the
proof
the
lacedaemonians
come
into
attica
not
by
themselves
but
with
their
whole
confederacy
following
we
go
alone
into
a
neighbor
country
and
although
our
opponents
are
fighting
for
their
homes
and
we
are
on
a
foreign
soil
we
have
seldom
any
difficulty
in
overcoming
them
our
enemies
have
never
yet
felt
our
united
strength
the
care
of
a
navy
divides
our
attention
and
on
land
we
are
obliged
to
send
our
own
citizens
everywhere
but
they
if
they
meet
and
defeat
a
part
of
our
army
are
as
proud
as
if
they
had
routed
us
all
and
when
defeated
they
pretend
to
have
been
vanquished
by
us
all
if
then
we
prefer
to
meet
danger
with
a
light
heart
but
without
laborious
training
and
with
a
courage
which
is
gained
by
habit
and
not
enforced
by
law
are
we
not
greatly
the
gainers
since
we
do
not
anticipate
the
pain
although
when
the
hour
comes
we
can
be
as
brave
as
those
who
never
allow
themselves
to
rest
and
thus
too
our
city
is
equally
admirable
in
peace
and
war
for
we
are
lovers
of
the
beautiful
yet
simple
in
our
tastes
and
we
cultivate
the
mind
without
loss
of
manliness
wealth
we
employ
not
for
talk
and
ostentation
but
when
there
is
real
use
for
it
to
avow
poverty
with
us
is
no
disgrace
the
true
disgrace
is
in
doing
nothing
to
avoid
it
an
athenian
citizen
does
not
neglect
the
state
because
he
takes
care
of
his
own
household
and
even
those
of
us
who
are
engaged
in
business
have
a
very
fair
idea
of
politics
we
alone
regard
a
man
who
takes
no
interest
in
public
affairs
not
as
harmless
but
as
a
useless
character
and
if
few
of
us
are
originators
we
are
all
sound
judges
of
policy
the
great
impediment
to
action
is
in
our
opinion
not
discussion
but
the
want
of
that
knowledge
which
is
gained
by
discussion
preparatory
to
action
for
we
have
a
peculiar
power
of
thinking
before
we
act
and
of
acting
too
whereas
other
men
are
courageous
from
ignorance
but
hesitate
upon
reflection
and
they
are
surely
to
be
esteemed
the
bravest
spirits
who
having
the
clearest
sense
both
of
the
pains
and
pleasures
of
life
do
not
on
that
account
shrink
from
danger
in
doing
good
again
we
are
unlike
others
we
make
our
friends
by
conferring
not
by
receiving
favors
now
he
who
confers
a
favor
is
the
firmer
friend
because
he
would
fain
by
kindness
keep
alive
the
memory
of
an
obligation
but
the
recipient
is
colder
in
his
feelings
because
he
knows
that
in
requiting
another
generosity
he
will
not
be
winning
gratitude
but
only
paying
a
debt
we
alone
do
good
to
our
neighbors
not
upon
a
calculation
of
interest
but
in
the
confidence
of
freedom
and
in
a
frank
and
fearless
spirit
to
sum
up
i
say
that
athens
is
the
school
of
hellas
and
that
the
individual
athenian
in
his
own
person
seems
to
have
the
power
of
adapting
himself
to
the
most
varied
forms
of
action
with
the
utmost
versatility
and
grace
this
is
no
passing
and
idle
word
but
truth
and
fact
and
the
assertion
is
verified
by
the
position
to
which
these
qualities
have
raised
the
state
for
in
the
hour
of
trial
athens
alone
among
her
contemporaries
is
superior
to
the
report
of
her
no
enemy
who
comes
against
her
is
indignant
at
the
reverses
which
he
sustains
at
the
hands
of
such
a
city
no
subject
complains
that
his
masters
are
unworthy
of
him
and
we
shall
assuredly
not
be
without
witnesses
there
are
mighty
monuments
of
our
power
which
will
make
us
the
wonder
of
this
and
of
succeeding
ages
we
shall
not
need
the
praises
of
homer
or
of
any
other
panegyrist
whose
poetry
may
please
for
the
moment
although
his
representation
of
the
facts
will
not
bear
the
light
of
day
for
we
have
compelled
every
land
and
every
sea
to
open
a
path
for
our
valor
and
have
everywhere
planted
eternal
memorials
of
our
friendship
and
of
our
enmity
such
is
the
city
for
whose
sake
these
men
nobly
fought
and
died
they
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
she
might
be
taken
from
them
and
every
one
of
us
who
survive
should
gladly
toil
on
her
behalf
we
find
in
a
much
purer
tone
of
moral
and
religious
feeling
than
in
greek
thought
upon
divine
things
is
expanded
and
purified
i
conception
of
the
the
gods
are
still
conceived
of
as
in
bodily
form
their
images
abide
in
their
temples
take
them
away
and
the
god
leaves
his
abode
the
divinities
need
not
be
present
as
in
homer
in
order
to
exert
their
power
the
monotheistic
tendency
is
manifest
the
gods
are
referred
to
as
if
a
single
agency
were
in
the
writer
mind
the
regal
sway
of
zeus
is
emphasized
he
is
less
subject
to
fate
the
gods
especially
are
the
fountain
of
law
the
righteousness
of
the
divine
government
is
especially
evinced
in
the
punishment
of
transgressors
generally
and
not
those
of
the
worst
class
alone
as
in
homer
are
punished
in
pride
and
insolence
call
down
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
unsleeping
justice
pursues
the
criminal
the
theory
of
which
pursues
the
prosperous
if
they
are
proud
to
their
hurt
and
ruin
is
held
of
the
the
number
of
divinities
is
multiplied
as
time
advances
the
worship
of
the
heroes
children
of
the
gods
or
goddesses
grows
in
importance
there
was
direct
revelation
it
was
believed
by
prophecy
uttered
now
in
an
ecstatic
and
now
in
a
tranquil
mood
acquired
a
new
and
vast
importance

of
devotion

its
parts

within

compassion
find
a
beautiful
expression
at
athens
there
was
public
provision
for
orphans
and
for
the
help
of
the
poor
life
the
wife
lived
in
retirement
and
in
submission
to
her
husband
when
he
entertained
friends
at
his
table
she
was
absent
yet
domestic
affection
was
evidently
strong
every
other
duty
merged
in
patriotism
the
greek
placed
a
great
gulf
between
himself
and
the
barbarian
he
was
conscious
of
higher
intellectual
gifts
superior
culture
better
customs
the
future
there
was
a
deeper
sense
of
sin
than
in
the
homeric
era
there
was
a
pathetic
consciousness
of
the
trouble
and
sorrow
that
beset
human
life
was
regarded
as
a
scene
of
trial
and
judgment
and
of
rewards
as
well
as
sufferings
the
soul
was
not
so
closely
identified
with
the
body
death
was
an
object
of
gloomy
anticipation
in
his
funeral
oration
for
the
fallen
patriots
is
silent
as
to
a
future
life
in
the
tragic
poets
it
is
only
the
select
few
whose
lot
is
blessed
as
concerns
the
mass
of
the
people
it
is
probable
that
the
homeric
notions
respecting
the
state
of
the
dead
still
prevailed
generally
speaking
we
are
not
warranted
in
ascribing
the
more
elevated
views
of
religion
entertained
by
the
best
minds
to
the
mass
of
the
people
the
tragic
the
songs
which
were
sung
in
the
worship
of
dionysus
dithyrambs
were
accompanied
with
dance
and
pantomime
the
custom
followed
of
mingling
speeches
and
dramatic
action
with
these
lyrics
the
change
is
ascribed
to
about
a
little
later
than
solon
thespis
is
said
to
have
brought
in
the
stage
for
the
performers
the
greek
theaters
were
large
open
to
the
sky
and
sometimes
on
sites
which
commanded
fine
views
there
was
the
amphitheater
with
graded
seats
for
spectators
and
the
stage
together
with
the
orchestra
where
the
choir
in
song
or
musical
recitation
reflected
the
sympathies
and
views
of
the
spectators
of
the
play
at
first
there
was
only
one
actor
and
of
course
a
monologue
is
said
to
have
brought
in
a
second
actor
and
a
third
these
with
were
the
three
great
dramatists
of
greece
the
choral
song
which
had
been
the
chief
thing
was
made
secondary
to
the
dialogue
aeschylus
at
the
age
of
fought
in
the
battle
of
salamis
sophocles
then
fifteen
years
old
took
part
in
the
festival
in
honor
of
the
victory
and
euripides
was
born
it
was
supposed
on
the
very
day
of
the
battle
these
three
brought
the
tragic
drama
to
perfection
of
the
productions
of
aeschylus
seven
remain
they
are
inspired
with
the
heroic
and
elevated
mood
which
was
engendered
by
the
great
struggle
against
the
persians
of
the
numerous
plays
of
sophocles
the
number
of
those
extant
is
also
seven
they
so
combine
vigor
and
force
with
refinement
of
thought
and
style
that
they
are
surpassed
if
indeed
they
are
equaled
by
the
literary
products
of
no
age
or
country
in
euripides
while
there
is
an
insight
into
the
workings
of
the
heart
and
the
antique
nobleness
of
sentiment
there
is
less
simplicity
and
there
is
manifest
the
less
earnest
and
believing
tone
of
the
later
day
in
the
dramas
the
unities
of
time
place
and
action
are
observed
the
acts
together
seldom
stretch
over
a
single
day
comedy
comedy
in
which
a
great
poet
as
well
as
a
great
wit
was
the
principal
author
dealt
largely
in
satire
conspicuous
men
and
those
active
in
public
affairs
were
represented
on
the
stage
in
satirical
pieces
so
that
they
were
at
once
identified
the
spirit
of
the
old
comedy
was
patriotic
although
it
might
be
unjust
as
in
the
case
of
socrates
who
was
a
target
for
the
wit
of
aristophanes
the
middle
comedy
was
nothing
really
distinct
from
the
new
comedy
the
new
comedy
in
which
menander
was
an
eminent
author
ceased
to
present
actual
persons
and
dealt
with
imaginary
characters
alone
among
the
greeks
in
lower
italy
and
sicily
mimes
were
much
in
vogue
greek
art
architecture
the
greeks
more
and
more
broke
away
in
a
free
and
joyous
spirit
from
the
stiff
and
conventional
styles
of
egyptian
and
oriental
art
in
the
room
of
the
somber
massive
edifices
of
egypt
they
combined
symmetry
and
beauty
with
grandeur
in
the
temples
which
they
erected
the
temples
were
originally
colored
within
and
without
three
styles
were
developed
the
the
and
the
in
the
the
column
and
entablature
have
the
most
solid
and
simple
form
the
column
has
no
other
base
than
the
common
platform
on
which
the
pillars
rest
and
the
capital
that
surmounts
it
is
a
plain
slab
in
the
style
the
column
has
a
distinct
base
is
more
tall
and
slender
and
its
capital
has
two
or
spiral
moldings
the
capital
of
the
column
is
peculiar
representing
flower
calices
and
leaves
pointing
upwards
and
curving
like
natural
plants
the
on
account
of
its
graceful
form
was
generally
copied
the
most
ancient
doric
temples
of
a
date
prior
to
the
persian
war
of
which
the
ruined
temple
of
neptune
at
paestum
is
one
are
in
comparison
with
later
edifices
of
a
severe
and
massive
style
in
the
period
extending
from
the
persian
war
to
the
macedonian
rule
the
stern
simplicity
of
the
doric
is
modified
by
the
softer
and
more
graceful
character
of
the
ionic
the
temple
of
at
athens
is
an
example
the
was
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
the
doric
which
has
appropriated
the
grace
of
the
ionic
column
without
losing
its
own
distinctive
character
in
the
later
period
after
freedom
was
lost
there
was
much
more
ornamentation
it
was
then
that
the
more
decorated
corinthian
style
flourished
before
the
persian
wars
in
the
earliest
sculpture
the
restraint
of
egyptian
and
oriental
styles
is
perceptible
in
the
sculptors
of
whom
daedalus
is
the
mythical
representative
the
oldest
statues
were
of
wood
which
was
subsequently
covered
with
gold
and
ivory
or
painted
the
lofty
style
of
and
of
of
argos
became
prevalent
in
the
flourishing
period
of
greek
liberty
to
whom
we
owe
the
belongs
to
the
school
of
aegina
statues
were
now
made
in
brass
and
marble
they
were
everywhere
to
be
seen
the
pediments
and
friezes
of
the
temples
were
covered
with
exquisitely
wrought
sculptures
the
most
beautiful
sculptures
that
have
come
down
from
antiquity
are
the
marbles
of
the
parthenon
the
greeks
appreciated
to
the
full
the
beauty
of
nature
they
gave
to
their
gods
ideal
human
forms
in
which
were
blended
every
attribute
of
majesty
and
grace
which
are
conceived
to
belong
to
perfected
humanity
sculpture
in
greece
as
elsewhere
was
ally
to
religion
but
whilst
the
religion
of
the
egyptians
was
a
religion
of
the
tomb
and
their
ideal
world
a
gloomy
spot
peopled
by
sleeping
lions
dreamy
sphinxes
or
weird
unearthly
monsters
the
mythology
of
the
greeks
rightly
understood
is
an
exquisite
poem
the
joint
creation
of
the
of
infant
greece
and
their
art
is
a
translation
of
that
poem
into
visible
forms
of
beauty
in
the
which
may
be
made
to
terminate
with
the
death
of
the
there
were
masters
in
sculpture
among
whom
and
are
at
the
head
more
and
more
as
we
come
down
to
the
roman
period
while
extraordinary
technical
perfection
is
still
manifested
the
loftier
qualities
of
art
tend
to
disappear
in
greece
painting
first
ceased
to
be
subordinate
to
architecture
and
became
independent
in
early
days
there
was
skill
in
the
ornamentation
of
vases
and
in
mural
painting
yet
with
much
spirit
and
feeling
there
was
a
conventional
treatment
the
earliest
artist
of
whom
we
know
much
is
about
whose
groups
of
profile
figures
were
described
as
remarkable
for
their
character
and
fine
coloring
of
athens
was
distinguished
but
of
heraclea
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
paint
movable
pictures
he
is
famed
for
his
marvelous
power
of
imitation
the
birds
pecked
at
a
bunch
of
grapes
which
he
painted
but
even
he
was
outdone
by
zeuxis
however
had
far
higher
qualities
than
those
of
a
literal
copyist
the
most
successful
of
the
greek
painters
was
among
his
masterpieces
was
a
painting
of
venus
rising
from
the
waves
and
a
portrait
of
alexander
the
great
we
have
not
in
painting
as
in
sculpture
a
store
of
monuments
of
greek
art
but
the
skill
of
the
greeks
in
painting
fell
behind
their
unequaled
genius
in
molding
the
human
form
in
bronze
and
marble
chapter
iii
the
peloponnesian
war
i
to
the
peace
of
nicias
to
the
death
of
wonderful
as
was
the
growth
of
athens
under
pericles
it
is
obvious
that
she
stood
exposed
to
two
principal
sources
of
danger
her
allies
and
dependants
the
stay
of
that
naval
power
in
which
her
strength
lay
were
discontented
with
her
spirit
of
domination
and
of
extortion
the
which
was
led
by
the
bulwark
of
the
aristocratic
interest
comprised
with
the
dorian
most
of
the
aeolian
states
as
boeotia
phocis
locris
etc
its
military
strength
lay
mainly
in
its
infantry
thus
sparta
had
the
advantage
of
strong
allies
the
motive
at
the
bottom
of
this
alliance
was
what
thucydides
tells
was
the
real
cause
of
the
peloponnesian
war
the
jealousy
which
the
growth
of
athens
excited
in
other
states
this
feeling
really
involved
a
conviction
of
the
need
of
maintaining
in
greece
that
which
in
modern
times
is
called
a
balance
of
power
when
greece
was
no
longer
one
as
in
the
best
days
of
the
wars
with
persia
but
was
divided
into
two
opposite
camps
watchful
and
jealous
of
one
another
an
occasion
of
conflict
could
not
fail
to
arise
it
was
complained
that
athens
gave
help
to
in
a
war
with
its
mother
city
made
war
upon
in
macedonia
a
corinthian
colony
and
also
shut
out
from
the
harbors
of
attica
the
demands
made
by
sparta
which
included
the
granting
of
independence
to
were
rejected
attica
was
ravaged
by
spartan
troops
and
the
coast
of
peloponnesus
by
the
athenian
fleet
this
desolating
warfare
was
kept
up
until
a
frightful
pestilence
broke
out
at
athens
a
plague
having
its
origin
in
egypt
and
passing
thence
over
asia
and
the
greek
islands
two
of
the
sons
of
pericles
died
and
an
accumulation
of
public
burdens
and
private
sorrows
brought
on
his
own
death
the
the
horrors
of
the
pestilence
are
thus
described
in
a
celebrated
passage
of
the
best
of
the
greek
historians
the
crowding
of
the
people
out
of
the
country
into
the
city
aggravated
the
misery
and
the
newly
arrived
suffered
most
for
haying
no
houses
of
their
own
but
inhabiting
in
the
height
of
summer
stifling
huts
the
mortality
among
them
was
dreadful
and
they
perished
in
wild
disorder
the
dead
lay
as
they
had
died
one
upon
another
while
others
hardly
alive
wallowed
in
the
streets
and
crawled
about
every
fountain
craving
for
water
the
temples
in
which
they
lodged
were
full
of
the
corpses
of
those
who
died
in
them
for
the
violence
of
the
calamity
was
such
that
men
not
knowing
where
to
turn
grew
reckless
of
all
law
human
and
divine
the
customs
which
had
hitherto
been
observed
at
funerals
were
universally
violated
and
they
buried
their
dead
each
one
as
best
he
could
many
having
no
proper
appliances
because
the
deaths
in
their
household
had
been
so
frequent
made
no
scruple
of
using
the
of
others
when
one
man
had
raised
a
others
would
come
and
throwing
on
their
dead
first
set
fire
to
it
or
when
some
other
corpse
was
already
burning
before
they
could
be
stopped
would
throw
their
own
dead
upon
it
and
depart
there
were
other
and
worse
forms
of
lawlessness
which
the
plague
introduced
at
athens
men
who
had
hitherto
concealed
their
indulgence
in
pleasure
now
grew
bolder
for
seeing
the
sudden
change
how
the
rich
died
in
a
moment
and
those
who
had
nothing
immediately
inherited
their
property
they
reflected
that
life
and
riches
were
alike
transitory
and
they
resolved
to
enjoy
themselves
while
they
could
and
to
think
only
of
pleasure
who
would
be
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
to
the
law
of
honor
when
he
knew
not
whether
he
would
ever
live
to
be
held
in
honor
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
and
any
sort
of
thing
which
conduced
to
it
took
the
place
both
of
honor
and
of
expediency
no
fear
of
god
or
law
of
man
deterred
a
criminal
those
who
saw
all
perishing
alike
thought
that
the
worship
or
neglect
of
the
gods
made
no
difference
for
offenses
against
human
law
no
punishment
was
to
be
feared
no
one
would
live
long
enough
to
be
called
to
account
already
a
far
heavier
sentence
had
been
passed
and
was
hanging
over
a
man
head
before
that
fell
why
should
he
not
take
a
little
pleasure
to
the
truce
with
the
loss
of
pericles

with
the
terrible
calamities
which
had
befallen

not
able
to
save
to
which
they
owed
so
much
from
destruction

they
recovered

completely
vanquished
the

the
resources
of

never
more
impressively
shown
than
in

prodigious
efforts
made

to
rise
from
the
effect
of
the
crushing
disaster
which
befell
the
sicilian
expedition
on
which
their
hopes
were

shortly
after

the

occurred
the
wisest
and
most
virtuous
man
of
ancient
times
philosophy
at
the
head
of
the
greek
philosophers
is
the
illustrious
name
of
he
was
the
son
of
sophroniscus
a
sculptor
and
was
born
just
as
pericles
was
assuming
the
leadership
at
athens
socrates
was
the
founder
of
moral
philosophy
he
was
original
being
indebted
for
his
ideas
to
no
previous
school
he
was
as
sound
in
body
as
in
mind
his
appearance
was
unique
his
forehead
was
massive
but
his
flat
nose
gave
to
his
countenance
an
aspect
quite
at
variance
with
the
greek
ideal
of
beauty
he
looked
it
was
said
like
a
satyr
he
taught
in
opposition
to
the
a
class
of
men
including
and
others
who
instructed
young
men
in
logic
and
grammar
taking
fees
which
was
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
greek
philosophers
and
cultivating
intellectual
keenness
and
dexterity
often
at
the
expense
of
depth
and
sincerity
their
work
as
thinkers
was
negative
being
confined
mainly
to
pointing
out
fallacies
in
existing
systems
but
providing
nothing
positive
in
the
room
of
them
had
been
called
by
the
oracle
at
delphi
the
wisest
of
men
he
could
only
account
for
this
by
the
fact
that
in
contrast
with
others
he
did
not
erroneously
deem
himself
to
be
knowing
know
thyself
was
his
maxim
his
daily
occupation
was
to
converse
with
different
classes
especially
young
men
on
subjects
of
highest
moment
to
the
individual
and
to
the
state
by
a
method
of
quiet
the
he
made
them
aware
of
their
lack
of
clear
ideas
and
tenable
consistent
opinions
and
endeavored
to
guide
them
aright
the
and
its
moral
improvement
was
his
principal
subject
he
asserted
and
the
spiritual
nature
and
obligations
of
religion
without
calling
in
question
the
existence
of
the
various
divinities
he
taught
the
doctrine
of
a
universal
absolute
loyalty
to
conscience
the
preference
of
virtue
to
any
possible
advantage
without
it
he
solemnly
inculcated
he
believed
perhaps
not
without
a
mingling
of
doubt
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
taking
no
part
in
public
affairs
he
devoted
his
time
to
this
kind
of
familiar
instruction
to
teaching
by
dialogue
in
compliance
with
what
he
believed
to
be
an
inward
call
of
god
an
impulse
within
him
which
he
called
a
divine
voice
checked
him
when
he
was
about
to
take
a
wrong
step
he
was
charged
with
corrupting
the
youth
by
his
teaching
and
with
heresy
in
religion
his
rebukes
of
the
shallow
and
the
had
stung
them
and
had
made
him
many
enemies
such
men
as
and
who
had
been
among
his
hearers
but
for
whose
misconduct
he
was
really
not
in
the
least
responsible
added
to
his
unpopularity
the
as
given
by
plato
contains
the
substance
of
his
most
impressive
defense
before
his
judges
he
took
no
pains
to
placate
them
or
his
accusers
or
to
escape
after
he
was
convicted
conversing
with
his
disciples
in
the
same
genial
tranquil
tone
which
he
had
always
maintained
he
drank
the
cup
of
hemlock
and
expired
may
an
account
of
his
teaching
and
of
his
method
of
life
is
given
by
his
loving
scholar
in
the
the
dialogues
of
in
which
socrates
is
the
principal
interlocutor
mingle
with
the
master
doctrine
the
pupil
own
thoughts
and
speculations
the
foremost
of
the
disciples
of
socrates
founded
the
philosophical
school
known
as
the
from
the
place
where
his
pupils
were
wont
to
meet
him
one
of
his
prominent
tenets
was
the
doctrine
of
which
he
regarded
as
spiritual
realities
intermediate
between
god
and
the
world
of
which
all
visible
things
are
the
manifestation
they
are
the
shadow
so
to
speak
of
which
ideas
are
the
substance
he
defined
virtue
in
man
to
be
resemblance
to
god
according
to
the
measure
of
our
ability
in
the
he
sets
forth
his
political
views
and
sketches
the
ideal
state
more
speculative
than
socrates
plato
from
the
wide
range
of
his
discussions
from
their
poetic
spirit
as
well
as
their
depth
of
thought
not
less
than
their
beauty
of
style
is
one
of
the
most
inspiring
and
instructive
of
all
authors
no
other
heathen
writer
presents
so
many
points
of
affinity
with
christian
teaching
aristotle
studied
under
plato
but
elaborated
a
system
of
his
own
which
was
on
some
points
dissonant
from
that
of
his
instructor
his
investigations
extended
over
the
field
of
material
nature
as
well
as
over
the
field
of
mind
and
morals
with
less
of
poetry
and
of
lofty
sentiment
than
plato
he
has
never
been
excelled
in
intellectual
clearness
and
grasp
he
was
possessed
of
a
wonderful
power
to
observe
facts
and
an
equally
wonderful
talent
for
systemizing
them
and
reasoning
upon
them
he
is
the
founder
of
the
science
of
his
treatises
on
and
on
have
been
hardly
less
important
in
their
influence
his
is
a
masterly
discussion
of
political
science
based
on
a
diligent
examination
of
the
various
systems
of
government
in
truth
in
all
departments
of
research
he
exhibits
the
same
capacity
for
scientific
observation
and
discussion
in
religion
he
was
a
theist
but
he
is
less
spiritual
in
his
vein
of
thought
and
more
reserved
in
his
utterances
on
this
theme
than
plato
the
names
of
these
two
philosophers
have
been
very
frequently
coupled
their
influence
like
their
fame
is
imperishable
later
schools
the
the
impulse
given
by
socrates
gave
rise
to
still
other
schools
of
philosophers
of
cyrene
about
founded
a
sect
which
held
that
happiness
is
the
chief
end
the
goal
of
rational
effort
who
was
born
and
especially
went
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
founded
the
school
of
who
looked
with
disdain
not
only
on
luxuries
but
on
the
ordinary
comforts
of
life
and
inured
themselves
to
do
without
them
their
manners
were
often
as
savage
as
their
mode
of
living
historical
the
three
principal
historical
writers
were
the
charming
but
uncritical
chronicler
of
what
he
heard
and
saw
by
whom
the
interference
of
the
gods
in
human
affairs
is
devoutly
credited
who
himself
took
part
in
the
peloponnesian
war
the
history
of
which
he
wrote
with
a
candor
a
profound
perception
of
character
an
insight
into
the
causes
of
events
a
skill
in
arrangement
and
a
condensation
and
eloquence
of
style
which
are
truly
admirable
and
an
author
characterized
by
naturalness
simplicity
and
a
religious
spirit
greek
it
will
be
convenient
to
bring
together
here
some
features
of
greek
life
buildings
and
the
greeks
almost
always
preferred
to
live
in
cities
these
grew
up
about
an
which
was
a
fort
on
a
hill
generally
a
steep
crag
this
was
a
place
of
refuge
and
the
site
of
the
oldest
temple
it
became
often
therefore
a
sacred
place
from
which
private
dwellings
were
excluded
at
the
nearest
harbor
there
would
be
a
seaport
town
the
was
more
than
four
miles
from
athens
a
mile
farther
than
the
nearest
shore
but
was
chosen
as
being
an
excellent
harbor
sparta
alone
had
no
citadel
the
access
from
the
plain
being
easily
defended
and
no
walls
the
attractive
buildings
in
a
greek
town
were
the
public
edifices
private
houses
as
to
the
exterior
were
very
plain
with
flat
roofs
with
few
stories
and
low
towards
the
street
the
house
looked
like
a
dead
wall
with
a
strong
door
in
it
it
was
built
round
an
open
court
in
the
case
of
the
best
houses
round
two
courts
one
bordered
by
apartments
for
the
men
the
other
with
the
rooms
for
women
bedrooms
and
were
small
admitting
but
little
light
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
came
to
be
common
the
furniture
of
the
house
was
plain
and
simple
but
graceful
and
elegant
in
form
the
poorer
classes
slept
on
skins
the
richer
on
woolen
mattresses
laid
on
girths
the
greeks
lived
so
much
in
the
open
air
that
they
took
less
pains
with
their
dwellings
the
public
buildings
were
costly
and
substantially
built
gymnastics
the
greeks
rose
early
there
are
no
notices
of
a
morning
bath
the
first
meal
was
light
it
was
succeeded
as
was
the
custom
at
rome
by
calls
on
friends
business
might
follow
until
noon
the
hour
of
the
or
breakfast
which
in
the
case
of
the
rich
was
a
substantial
meal
later
in
the
day
males
went
to
the
practice
of
gymnastics
which
were
followed
in
later
times
by
a
warm
bath
towards
sunset
came
the
principal
meal
of
the
day
conversation
and
music
or
the
attending
of
a
feast
with
friends
took
up
the
evening
if
there
was
a
festal
company
often
the
whole
night
at
the
the
greeks
reclined
on
couches
ladies
if
allowed
to
be
present
and
children
were
required
to
sit
spoons
sometimes
knives
but
never
forks
were
used
use
of
the
dress
of
the
greeks
both
of
men
and
women
was
simple
and
graceful
the
men
were
generally
bareheaded
in
the
streets
in
bad
weather
they
wore
caps
and
in
traveling
hats
in
athens
and
sparta
they
always
carried
the
use
of
wine
was
universal
it
was
always
mixed
with
water
slaves
were
regarded
as
chattels
no
one
objected
to
slavery
as
wrong
slaves
were
better
treated
at
athens
than
elsewhere
but
even
at
athens
they
were
tortured
when
their
testimony
was
required
they
were
let
out
sometimes
by
thousands
to
work
in
pestiferous
mines
and
in
athens
the
wife
had
seldom
learned
any
thing
but
to
spin
and
to
cook
she
lived
in
seclusion
in
her
dwelling
and
was
not
present
with
her
husband
at
social
entertainments
either
at
home
or
elsewhere
she
had
few
if
any
legal
rights
although
at
athens
she
might
bring
a
suit
against
her
husband
for
concubinage
was
not
condemned
by
public
opinion
there
was
no
law
against
exposing
infants
whom
the
parents
did
not
wish
to
bring
up
that
is
leaving
them
where
they
would
perish
when
found
and
brought
up
they
were
the
slaves
of
the
person
finding
them
this
cruelty
was
frequent
in
the
case
of
daughters
or
of
offspring
weak
or
deformed
there
were
toys
and
games
for
children
a
philosopher
was
said
to
have
invented

balls
were
common
playthings
boys
and
girls
played
hide
and
seek
blind
man
buff
hunt
the
slipper
etc
older
people
played
ball
and
gambled
with
dice
the
education
of
boys
was
careful
that
of
girls
was
neglected
the
boy
went
to
or
from
school
under
the
care
of
a
slave
called
or
leader
teachers
were
of
different
social
grades
from
the
low
class
which
taught
small
children
to
the
professors
of
rhetoric
and
philosophy
it
is
needless
to
say
how
much
stress
was
laid
on
gymnastic
and
aesthetic
training
boys
read
and
other
authors
at
an
early
age
committing
much
of
them
to
memory
they
were
taught
to
play
on
the
harp
or
the
flute
and
to
sing
lyric
poems
they
learned
by
heart
held
a
very
high
place
in
the
esteem
of
the
greeks
for
its
general
influence
on
the
mind
running
wrestling
throwing
the
dart
the
games
practiced
at
the
public
contests
were
early
taught
boys
at
sixteen
or
eighteen
came
of
age
and
were
enrolled
as
citizens
instruments
the
instrumental
music
was
common
among
the
greeks
at
games
and
meals
and
in
battle
they
used
no
bows
on
the
stringed
instruments
but
either
the
fingers
or
the
a
stick
of
wood
ivory
or
metal
there
were
three
sorts
of
stringed
instruments
the
lyre
the
cithara
or
zithern
and
the
harp
the
were
the
pipe
the
clarionet
and
the
trumpet
besides
these
there
were
clanging
instruments
which
were
used
chiefly
in
religious
ceremonies
such
were
castanets
the
cymbal
and
the
tambourine
dancing
was
originally
connected
with
religious
worship
mimetic
dances
were
a
favorite
diversion
at
feasts
there
were
warlike
dances
by
men
in
armor
who
went
through
the
movements
of
attack
and
defense
in
mimetic
dances
the
hands
and
arms
played
a
part
there
were
peaceful
dances
or
choral
dances
marked
by
rhythmic
grace
sometimes
these
were
slow
and
measured
and
sometimes
more
lively
specially
brisk
were
the
dances
at
the
festivals
of
dionysus
bacchus
symbolic
dances
of
a
religious
character
these
bacchic
dances
were
the
germ
of
the
drama
recitations
were
first
introduced
between
hymns
that
attended
the
choric
dances
then
later
followed
the
dialogue
and
marriage
was
attended
by
a
religious
ceremonial
there
was
a
solemn
sacrifice
and
a
the
bride
was
conveyed
to
her
husband

accompanied
on
the
way
with
music
and
song
when
a
person
died
his
body
was
laid
out
for
one
day
during
which
the
relatives
and
hired
mourners
uttered
laments
round
the
bier
burial
was
at
the
dawn
of
day

to
have

his
absorbing

the
most
substantial
result
of
his

which
read
more
like

introduction
place
of
rome
in
rome
is
the
bridge
which
unites
while
it
separates
the
ancient
and
the
modern
world
the
history
of
rome
is
the
narrative
of
the
building
up
of
a
single
city
whose
dominion
gradually
spread
until
it
comprised
all
the
countries
about
the
mediterranean
or
what
were
then
the
civilized
nations
in
this
great
empire
was
gathered
up
the
sum
total
that
remained
of
the
religions
laws
customs
languages
letters
arts
and
sciences
of
all
the
nations
of
antiquity
which
had
successively
held
sway
or
predominance
under
the
system
of
roman
government
and
roman
law
they
were
combined
in
one
ordered
community
it
was
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ancient
roman
empire
that
the
modern
european
nations
were
formed
their
likeness
to
one
another
their
bond
of
fellowship
is
due
to
the
heritage
of
laws
customs
letters
religion
which
they
have
received
in
common
from
rome
the
inhabitants
of
ancient
until
a
late
period
in
roman
history
the
apennines
and
not
the
alps
were
the
northern
boundary
of
italy
the
most
of
the
region
between
the
alpine
range
and
the
apennines
on
both
sides
of
the
po
was
inhabited
by
akin
to
the
celts
of
the
same
name
north
of
the
alps
on
the
west
of
gallia
were
the
a
rough
people
of
unknown
extraction
people
thought
to
be
of
the
same
race
as
the
ligurians
dwelt
in
and
in
and
in
a
part
of
on
the
east
of
gallia
were
the
venetians
whose
lineage
is
not
ascertained
the
apennines
branch
off
from
the
alps
in
a
southeasterly
direction
until
they
near
the
adriatic
when
they
turn
to
the
south
and
descend
to
the
extreme
point
of
the
peninsula
thus
forming
the
backbone
of
italy
on
the
west
in
the
central
portion
of
the
peninsula
is
the
hilly
district
called
by
the
ancients
now
tuscany
and
the
plains
of
and
what
is
now
termed
the
district
about
rome
is
a
part
of
ancient
latium
the
differed
widely
both
in
appearance
and
in
language
from
the
romans
they
were
not
improbably
but
nothing
more
is
known
of
their
descent
in
the
east
in
what
is
now
and
in
there
was
another
people
the
whose
origin
is
not
certain
but
who
were
not
so
far
removed
from
the
greeks
as
from
the
latins
the
southern
and
portions
of
the
peninsula
were
the
seat
of
the
settlements
and
the
country
was
early
designated
leaving
out
the
etrurians
iapygians
and
greeks
italy
south
of
gallia
was
inhabited
by
nations
allied
to
one
another
and
more
remotely
akin
to
the
greeks
these
italian
nations
were
divided
into
an
eastern
and
a
western
stock
the
western
stock
the
whose
home
was
in
latium
were
much
nearer
of
kin
to
the
greeks
than
were
the
eastern
the
eastern
stock
comprised
the
and
the
it
included
the
sabines
samnites
and
lucanians
we
are
certain
that
from
the
common
cradle
of
peoples
and
languages
there
issued
a
stock
which
embraced
in
common
the
ancestors
of
the
greeks
and
the
italians
that
from
this
at
a
subsequent
period
the
italians
branched
off
and
that
these
divided
again
into
the
western
and
eastern
stocks
while
at
a
still
later
date
the
eastern
became
subdivided
into
umbrians
and
oscans
mommsen
of
vol
p
italy
and
in
two
important
points
italy
is
geographically
distinguished
from
greece
the
of
italy
is
more
uniform
not
being
broken
by
bays
and
harbors
and
it
is
not
cut
up
like
greece
by
chains
of
mountains
into
small
cantons
the
romans
had
not
the
same
inducement
to
become
a
people
there
were
fewer
cities
there
was
an
opportunity
for
closer
and
more
extended
leagues
it
is
remarkable
that
the
outlets
of
greece
were
towards
the
east
those
of
italy
towards
the
west
the
two
nations
were
thus
averted
from
one
another
they
were
so
to
speak
back
to
back
the
greeks
and
the
greeks
and
romans
although
sprung
from
a
common
ancestry
and
preserving
common
features
in
their
language
and
to
some
extent
in
their
religion
were
very
diverse
in
their
natural
traits
the
greeks
had
more
genius
the
romans
more
stability
in
art
and
letters
the
romans
had
little
originality
in
these
provinces
they
were
copyists
of
the
greeks
they
lacked
ideality
they
had
also
far
less
delicacy
of
perception
flexibility
and
native
refinement
of
manners
but
they
had
more
sobriety
of
character
and
more
endurance
they
were
a
people
and
in
their
capacity
for
discipline
lay
the
secret
of
their
supremacy
in
arms
and
of
their
ability
to
give
law
to
the
world
if
they
produced
a
much
less
number
of
great
men
than
the
greeks
there
was
more
widely
diffused
among
roman
citizens
a
conscious
dignity
and
strength
the
roman
was
naturally
the
fault
of
the
greek
was
belonged
to
the
greek
to
the
roman
above
all
the
sense
of
right
and
of
justice
was
stronger
among
the
romans
they
had
in
an
eminent
degree
the
political
instinct
the
capacity
for
governing
and
for
building
up
a
political
system
on
a
firm
basis
this
trait
was
connected
with
their
innate
reverence
for
authority
and
their
habit
of
obedience
the
noblest
product
of
the
latin
mind
is
the
which
is
the
foundation
of
almost
all
modern
codes
with
all
their
discernment
of
justice
and
love
of
order
the
romans
however
were
too
often
hard
and
cruel
their
history
is
stained
here
and
there
with
acts
of
unexampled
atrocity
in
private
life
too
when
the
rigor
of
gave
way
they
sunk
into
extremes
of
vulgar
sensuality
if
compared
with
the
greeks
they
stood
morally
at
a
greater
height
they
might
fall
to
a
lower
depth
the
roman
the
difference
between
the
greek
and
roman
mind
was
manifest
in
the
sphere
of
religion
before
their
separation
from
one
another
they
had
brought
from
the
common
hearthstone
elements
of
worship
which
both
retained
like
was
the
old
aryan
god
of
the
shining
sky
but
the
greek
conception
even
of
the
chief
deity
differed
from
the
roman
when
the
romans
came
into
intercourse
with
the
greeks
they
identified
the
greek
divinities
with
their
own
and
more
and
more
appropriated
the
tales
of
the
greek
mythology
linking
them
to
their
own
deities
of
the
early
worship
peculiar
to
the
romans
we
know
but
little
but
certain
traits
always
belonged
to
the
roman
religion
their
mood
was
too
prosaic
to
invent
a
theogony
to
originate
stories
of
the
births
loves
and
romantic
adventures
of
the
gods
such
as
the
greek
fancy
devised
the
roman
myths
were
heroic
not
religious
they
related
to
the
deeds
of
valiant
men
their
deities
were
in
the
first
place
much
more
abstract
less
vividly
conceived
less
endowed
with
distinct
personal
characteristics
and
secondly
their
service
to
the
gods
was
more
punctilious
and
methodical
it
was
regulated
down
to
the
minuti√¶
by
fixed
rules
worship
was
according
to
law
was
something
due
to
the
gods
and
was
discharged
like
any
other
debt
exactly
and
at
the
proper
time
the
roman
took
advantage
of
technicalities
in
dealing
with
his
gods
he
was
legal
to
the
core
the
word
had
the
same
root
as
it
denoted
the
bondage
or
service
owed
by
man
to
the
gods
in
return
for
their
protection
and
favor
and
hence
the
anxiety
or
scrupulous
watchfulness
against
the
omission
of
what
is
required
to
avert
the
displeasure
of
the
powers
above
origin
of
the
the
romans
attributed
their
origin
to
the
mythical
who
fled
with
a
band
of
fugitives
from
the
flames
of
and
whose
son
or
settled
in
in
latium
what
is
known
of
the
foundation
of
rome
is
that
it
was
a
settlement
of
latin
farmers
and
traders
on
the
group
of
hills
seven
in
number
near
the
border
of
latium
on
the
it
was
the
head
of
navigation
for
small
vessels
and
rome
was
at
first
it
would
seem
the
for
the
exchange
of
the
products
of
the
in
which
it
was
placed
such
an
outpost
would
be
useful
to
guard
latium
against
the
across
the
river
of
the
three
townships
or
clans
which
united
to
form
rome
the
the
and
the
the
first
and
third
were
latin
the
second
which
was
blended
with
the
roman
element
as
the
language
proves
the
clans
or
tribes
in
latium
together
formed
a
league
the
central
of
which
was
at
first
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
the
sabines
were
from
near
rome
certain
it
is
that
rome
even
at
the
outset
derived
its
strength
from
a
combination
of
tribes
period
rome
under
the
kings
and
the
patricians
chapter
rome
under
the
kings
character
of
the
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
romans
lived
for
a
time
under
the
rule
of
kings
these
were
not
like
the
greek
kings
hereditary
rulers
nor
were
they
chosen
from
a
single
family
but
the
stories
told
in
later
times
respecting
the
kings
their
names
and
doings
are
quite
unworthy
of
credit
they
rest
upon
no
contemporary
evidence
or
sure
tradition
to
say
nothing
of
the
miraculous
elements
that
enter
into
the
narratives
they
are
laden
with
other
improbabilities
which
prove
them
to
be
the
fruit
of
imagination
they
contain
impossibilities
in
chronology
they
ascribe
laws
institutions
and
religion
which
were
of
slow
growth
to
particular
individuals
apportioning
to
each
his
own
part
in
an
artificial
way
many
of
the
stories
are
borrowed
from
the
greeks
and
were
originally
told
by
them
about
other
matters
in
short
the
roman
legends
including
dates
such
as
are
recorded
in
this
chapter
are
fabrications
to
fill
up
a
void
in
regard
to
which
there
was
no
authentic
information
and
to
account
for
beliefs
and
customs
the
origin
of
which
no
one
knew
they
are
of
service
however
in
helping
us
to
ascertain
the
character
of
the
roman
constitution
and
something
about
its
growth
in
the
prehistoric
age
the
legendary
and
so
the
legend
runs
were
sons
of
the
god
by
a
priestess
of
vesta
whose
father
had
been
slain
by
his
wicked
brother
who
thereby
made
himself
king
of
alba
longa
the
twins
by
his
command
were
put
into
a
basket
and
thrown
into
the
tiber
the
cradle
was
caught
by
the
roots
of
a
a
came
out
and
suckled
them
and
a
shepherd
brought
them
up
as
his
own
children
grew
up
and
slew
the
usurper
the
two
brothers
founded
a
city
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
where

price
when

end
that
in
times
of
danger
the

another
story
told
of
the
haughty
king
was
that
when
he
had
grown
old
and
was
frightened
by
dreams
and
omens
he
sent
his
two
sons
to
consult
the
oracle
at
delphi
with
them
went
his
sister
son
who
was
called
on
account
of
his
supposed
silliness
which
was
really
feigned
to
deceive
the
tyrant
the
offering
which
he
brought
to
the
delphian
god
was
a
simple
staff
his
cousins
who
laughed
at
him
did
not
know
that
it
was
stuffed
with
gold
the
god
in
answer
to
a
question
said
that
he
would
reign
at
rome
who
should
first
kiss
his
mother

sense
of

the
cruel
outrage
of
the
king
son
of
which
the
wife
of
their
cousin
was
the
pure
and
innocent
victim
caused
the
expulsion

appointed
in
the
room
of
the
king
who
should
rule
for
one
year
was
one
when
it
was
ascertained
that
his
own
sons
had
taken
part
in
a
conspiracy
of
the
higher
class
to
restore
tarquinius
the
stern
roman
gave
orders
to
the
lictors
to
scourge
them
and
to
cut
off
their
heads
with
the
ax
now
the
senate
and
people
decreed
that
the
whole
race
of
tarquinius
should
be
banished
for
ever
tarquinius
went
among
the
etruscans
and
secured
the

of
the
people

of

a
battle
the

of
tarquinius
and
both
mounted
ran
upon

and
were
slain
each
army
marched
to

tarquinius
then
obtained
the
help
of
king
of
the
etruscans
with
a
strong
army
they
took
but
with
two
companions
posted
himself
at
the
entrance
of
the
bridge
and
kept
the
place
horatius
remaining
until
the
bridge
had
been
torn
away
behind
him
he
then
with
his
armor
on
leaped
into
the
river
and
swam
back
to
the
shore
the
town
was
hard
pressed
by
the
enemy
and
by
famine
went
into
camp
resolved
to
kill
him
but
he
slew
another
whom
he
mistook
for
the
king
when
threatened
with
death
he
thrust
his
right
hand
into
the
fire
to
show
that
he
had
no
fear
admiring
his
courage
gave
him
his
freedom
and
on
being
informed
that
three
hundred
young
romans
were
sworn
to
undertake
the
same
deed
which
had
come
to
perform
made
peace
without
requiring
the
restoration
of
tarquinius
not
despairing
persuaded
the
and
other
to
begin
war
against
rome
the
romans
appointed
a
dictator
to
meet
the
exigency
in
a
battle
near
when
the
romans
began
to
give
way
the
dictator
invoked
and
vowing
to
dedicate
a
temple
to
them
in
case
he
was
victorious
two
young
men
on
white
chargers
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
roman
troops
and
led
them
to
victory
now
gave
up
his
effort
and
went
to
to
the
tyrant
where
he
lived
until
his
death
truth
in
the
there
are
certain
facts
which
are
embedded
in
the
legends
was
at
one
time
the

of
the
latin
confederacy
the
invaded
latium
settled
on
some
of
the
hills
of
rome
allied
themselves
with
the
and
the
two
peoples
were
resolved
into
one
federal
state
this
last
change
was
a
very
important
step
the
tradition
of
a
doubling
of
the
senate
and
of
two
kings
and
although
not
in
literal
form
historical
is
believed
to
be
a
reminiscence
of
this
union
it
is
thought
that
the
earliest
royalty
was
priestly
in
its
character
and
that
this
was
superseded
by
a
military
kingship
it
is
probable
that
the
who
had
made
much
progress
in
civilization
in
the
arts
and
in
manufactures
gained
the
upper
hand
in
the
insignia
of
the
roman
kings
were
etruscan
the
etruscan
kings
were
driven
out
there
were
advances
in
civilization
under
them
the
division
of
the
people
into
classes
took
place
and
at
that
period
structures
like
the
servian
wall
were
built
patricians
and
the
romans
from
the
beginning
were
divided
into
the
upper
class
the
and
the
common
people
or
who
were
free
but
like
the
and
in
greece
had
no
political
rights
the
plebeians
as
they
included
the
conquered
class
were
not
all
poor
a
part
of
them
who
were
under
the
special
protection
of
citizens
their
were
called
the
patricians
were
the
descendants
of
the
first
settlers
and
proprietors
under
the
old
constitution
ascribed
in
the
legends
to
the
patricians
alone
formed
the
military
force
and
were
styled
the
they
were
divided
into
districts
or
wards
at
first
ten
in
number
and
after
the
union
of
the
romans
with
the
and
thirty
each
was
divided
into
ten
families
or
the
assembly
of
the
citizens
was
called
the
the

the
the
was
a
council
of
elders
representing
in
some
way
the
gentes
the
clan
or
was
always
of
great
consequence
among
the
romans
its
name
was
a
part
of
the
proper
name
of
every
citizen
the
particular
or
individual
names
in
vogue
were
not
numerous
the
name
of
the
gens
was
placed
between
the
personal
name
or
the
and
the
designation
of
the
special
family
included
in
the
gens
thus
in
the
case
of
caius
julius
caesar
julius
was
the
designation
of
the
gens
caesar
of
the
family
while
caius
was
the
personal
name
the
early
the
servian
constitution
made
all
whether
patrician
or
plebeian
subject
to
taxation
and
obliged
to
do
military
service
the
cavalry
the
or
knights
was
made
up
by
adding
to
the
six
patrician
companies
already
existing
double
the
number
from
both
classes
the
infantry
were
organized
without
reference
to
rank
but
were
graded
according
to
their
property
the
whole
people
were
divided
thus
into
five
classes
and
when
assembled
formed
the
as
being
made
up
of
the
companies
called
centuries
or
hundreds
at
first
this
body
was
only
consulted
by
the
king
in
regard
to
offensive
wars
gradually
it
drew
away
more
and
more
power
from
the
which
consisted
solely
of
patricians
those
who
had
no
land
were
now
distinguished
from
the
plebeians
for
the
purposes
of
conscription
the
city
was
divided
into
four
or
wards
every
four
years
a

to
be
taken
when
the
kingship
was
abolished
and
under
the
system
that
followed
the
two
were
to
be
patricians
they
exercised
regal
power
during
their
term
of
office
they
appointed
the
senators
and
the
two
who
came
to
have
charge
of
the
treasury
under
consular
supervision
the
consuls
were
attended
by
twelve
who
carried
the
bundles
of
rods
fastened
around
an
ax
which
symbolized
the
power
of
the
magistrate
to
flog
or
to
behead
offenders
the
acquired
the
right
to
elect
the
consuls
to
hear
appeals
in
capital
cases
from
their
verdicts
and
to
accept
or
reject
bills
laid
before
it
this
was
a
great
gain
for
the
plebeians
yet
the
patricians
were
strong
enough
in
this
assembly
to
control
its
action
on
occasions
of
extraordinary
peril
a
might
be
selected
by
one
of
the
consuls
who
was
to
have
absolute
authority
for
the
time
the
senate
commonly
had
an
important
part
however
in
the
selection
of
this
officer
there
was
a
of
to
command
the
knights
under
him
he
was
appointed
by
the
dictator
worship
in
families
was
conducted
by
the
head
of
the
household
the
who
offered
the
regular
sacrifices
but
as
regards
the
whole
people
worship
was
under
the
direction
of
the
pontiffs
with
the
chief
pontiff

their
head
and
in
the
hands
of
the

these
were
all
officers
of
the

elected
to
their
places
and
entirely
subordinate
to
the
civil
magistrates
the
were
not
so
much
priests
as
they
were
guardians
and
interpreters
of
divine
law
they
were
masters
of
sacred
lore
they
looked
out
that
the
numberless
and
complex
rules
in
respect
to
religious
observances
should
be
strictly
complied
with
at
the
same
time
they
had
enough
knowledge
of
astronomy
to
enable
them
to
fix
the

suitable
for

quarters
and
then
watched
for
the
passage
of

from
which
he
took
the
auspices
in
early
times
there
was
an
implicit
faith
in
these
supposed
indications
of
the
will
of
the
divinities
but
this
credulity
passed
away
and
the
auguries
became
a
political
instrument
for
helping
forward
the
schemes
of
some
person
or
party
besides
the
college
of

and

the

who
ministered
in
her
temple
and
kept
the

from

the

worshiped
by

the

god
of

was
an
old
roman
goddess
who
presided
over

but
gradually
was
identified
with
the
grecian
and
were
household
divinities
guardians
of
the

the
romans
assigned
a
spirit
to
almost
every
thing
each

thus
the
number
of

was
countless

small

of

chapter
ii
rome
under
the
patricians
rivalry
of
the
abolishing
of
royalty
left
rome
as
a
house
divided
against
itself
the
power
granted
to
the
did
not
suffice
to
produce
contentment
the
patricians
still
decided
every
thing
and
used
their
strength
in
an
oppressive
way
besides
the
standing
contest
between
the
patricians
and
plebeians
there
was
great
suffering
on
the
side
of
the
poorer
class
of
plebeians
many
were
obliged
to
incur
debts
and
their
creditors
enforced
the
rigorous
law
against
them
loading
them
with
chains
and
driving
their
families
from
their
homes
a
great
and
constant
grievance
was
the
taking
by
the
patricians
of
the
public
lands
which
had
been
obtained
by
conquest
for
a
moderate
rent
which
might
not
be
paid
at
all
if
they
granted
a
share
in
this
privilege
to
some
rich
plebeian
houses
this
afforded
no
help
to
the
mass
of
the
people
who
were
more
and
more
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
till
the
smaller
holdings
in
consequence
of
the
employment
of
slaves
yet
the
plebeians
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
military
service
at
length
they
rose
in
a
body
probably
in
returning
from
some
victory
and
encamped
on
a
hill
the
three
miles
from
rome
where
they
threatened
to
stay
and
found
another
town
this
bold
movement
led
to
an
agreement
it
was
stipulated
that
they
should
elect
magistrates
from
their
own
class
to
be
called
of
the
who
should
have
the
right
to
interpose
an
absolute
veto
upon
any
legal
or
administrative
measure
this
right
each
consul
already
had
in
relation
to
his
colleague
to
secure
the
commons
in
this
new
right
the
tribunes
were
declared
to
be
inviolable
whoever
used
violence
against
them
was
to
be
an
outlaw
the
power
of
the
tribunes
at
first
was
merely
protective
but
their
power
grew
until
it
became
controlling
one
point
where
their
authority
was
apt
to
be
exerted
was
in
the
conscription
or
military
enrollment
this
if
it
were
undertaken
in
an
unfair
way
they
could
stop
altogether
and
thus
compel
a
change
the
plebeian
not
far
from
this
time
there
was
instituted
a
new
assembly
the
of
tribes
or
comitia
there
was
a
new
division
of
the
people
into
tribes
or
wards
first
twenty
then
and
later
in
this
comitia
the
plebeians
were
at
the
outset
if
not
always
the
exclusive
voters
the
patricians
had
their
assembly
the
the
comitia
of
the
tribes
which
was
then
controlled
by
the
plebeians
chose
the
tribunes
by
degrees
both
the
other
assemblies
lost
their
importance
the
plebeian
body
more
and
more
extended
its
prerogatives
besides
the
tribunes
the
two
in
number
who
were
assistants
of
the
tribunes
and
superintended
the
business
of
the
markets
were
chosen
by
the
the
law
of
the
anxiety
of
the
plebeians
to
be
rid
of
the
restrictions
upon
the
holding
and
enjoyment
of
land
led
to
the
proposal
of
a
law
for
their
relief
by
the
consul
of
the
terms
of
the
law
we
have
no
precise
knowledge
we
only
know
that
when
he
retired
from
office
he
was
condemned
and
put
to
death
by
the
ruling
class
war
with
the
aequians
and
the
about
this
time
rome
concluded
a
league
with
the
and
soon
after
with
another
people
the
who
lived
farther
eastward
between
the
aequians
and
volscians
it
was
a
defensive
alliance
in
which
rome
had
the
leading
place
then
follow
the
wars
with
the
and
where
the
traditional
accounts
are
mingled
with
many
fictitious
occurrences
there
are
two
stories
of
special
note
the
story
of
coriolanus
and
the
story
of
cincinnatus
it
is
related
that
a
brave
patrician
marcius
at
a
time
when
grain
was
scarce
and
was
procured
with
difficulty
from
etruria
and
sicily
for
the
relief
of
the
famishing
proposed
that
it
should
be
withheld
from
the
plebeians
unless
they
would
give
up
the
tribunate
the
anger
of
this
class
and
the
contempt
which
he
showed
for
it
caused
him
to
be
banished
thereupon
he
went
to
the
and
led
an
army
against
rome
an
army
too
strong
to
be
resisted
one
deputation
after
another
went
out
of
the
city
to
placate
him
but
in
vain
at
length
his
mother
and
his
wife
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
matrons
went
to
his
camp
and
entreated
him
their
prayer
he
could
not
deny
but
exclaimed
o
my
mother
rome
thou
hast
saved
but
thou
hast
lost
thy
son
he
died
among
the
volscians
the
tale
certainly
in
most
of
its
parts
is
fictitious
for
example
he
is
said
to
have
been
called
from
having
previously
conquered
but
such
designations
were
not
given
among
the
romans
until
centuries
later
the
story
of
in
essential
particulars
is
probably
true
at
a
time
when
the
romans
were
hard
pressed
by
the
the
messengers
of
the
senate
waited
on
lucius
quinctius
cincinnatus
formerly
a
senator
and
a
consul
of
renown
in
peace
and
war
and
asked
him
to
become
dictator
they
found
him
plowing
in
his
field
he
accepted
the
post
by
his
prudence
and
vigor
delivered
the
state
and
on
the
sixteenth
day
laid
down
his
office
and
went
back
to
his
farm
the
time
required
by
the
hero
for
his
task
was
doubtless
much
longer
than
the
legend
allows
there
is
an
authentic
tradition
of
a
war
with
the
who
had
retained
certain
towns
on
the
roman
side
of
the
tiber
the
romans
established
a
fort
on
the
not
far
from
which
was
one
of
them
in
the
course
of
this
struggle
it
is
said
that
all
the
a
distinguished
roman
family
except
one
boy
were
perfidiously
slain
this
is
an
exaggerated
tale
a
truce
was
concluded
with
for
forty
years
which
left
rome
free
to
fight
her
enemies
on
the
east
and
south
the
the
internal
conflict
of
the
patricians
against
the
commons
in
rome
went
on
in
the
was
passed
to
establish
fully
the
right
of
the
plebeians
alone
to
elect
their
tribunes
or
to
exclude
the
upper
class
from
their
comitia
the
claims
of
the
plebeians
who
formed
the
greater
part
of
the
fighting
men
rose
they
demanded
first
however
that
they
should
have
the
same
rights
as
the
patricians
and
that
the
laws
should
be
made
more
efficient
for
their
protection
by
being
reduced
to
a
code
this
was
the
object
of
the
proposed
in
the
result
was
a
great
dispute
some
concessions
failed
to
satisfy
the
plebeians
finally
it
was
agreed
that
ten
men
should
be
chosen
indiscriminately
from
both
classes
to
frame
a
code
they
meantime
to
supersede
the
consuls
and
tribunes
in
the
exercise
of
the
government
they
were
to
equalize
the
laws
and
to
write
them
down
the
story
of
the
mission
to
athens
for
the
study
of
the
laws
of
is
not
worthy
of
credit
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
many
obstacles
were
put
in
the
way
of
the
project
by
the
conservative
patricians
and
that
one
of
their
order
took
a
prominent
part
probably
on
the
side
of
the
people
here
comes
in
the
story
of
it
is
related
that
was
an
ambitious
and
bad
man
who
being
one
of
the
decemvirs
wished
to
hold
on
to
power
he
conceived
a
base
passion
for
the
daughter
of
a
brave
plebeian
centurion
and
claimed
her
on
the
pretense
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
slaves
standing
at
his
seeing
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
save
his
child
from
the
clutch
of
the
villainous
judge
plunged
his
dagger
in
her
heart
this
was
the
signal
for
another
revolt
of
the
people
which
extorted
the
consent
of
the
upper
class
to
the
sacred
laws
and
the
restoration
of
the
tribuneship
it
is
a
plausible
theory
that
favored
the
plebeian
claims
and
that
the
tale
told
above
is
a
later
invention
to
his
discredit
political
the
laws
of
the
twelve
tables
lay
at
the
basis
of
all
subsequent
legislation
in
rome
and
were
always
held
in
reverence
the
plebeians
soon
gained
further
advantages
in
it
was
ordained
under
the
consuls
and
that
the
plebeian
assembly
of
tribes
should
be
a
sovereign
assembly
whose
enactments
should
be
binding
on
the
whole
roman
people
in
the
law
of
legalized
marriage
between
the
plebeians
and
patricians
this
was
an
important
step
towards
the
closer
union
of
the
two
classes
the
executive
power
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
patricians
but
in
a
new
office
that
of
with
consular
power
to
be
chosen
from
the
plebeians
was
established
by
way
of
offset
to
this
great
concession
a
new
patrician
office
that
of
was
created
the
function
of
the
two
censors
who
were
to
be
chosen
by
the
was
to
take
the
census
at
short
intervals
to
make
out
the
to
appoint
senators
and
knights
to
manage
the
collection
of
taxes
to
superintend
public
buildings
and
finally
to
exercise
an
indefinite
supervision
over
public
manners
and
morals
these
were
very
great
powers
we
find
that
considerable
time
elapsed
before
the
plebeians
actually
realized
the
advantage
which
they
had
legally
won
in
this
compromise
about
the
year
they
succeeded
in
electing
several
military
tribunes
as
early
as
three
out
of
the
four
treasurers
or
paymasters
were
plebeians
about
forty
years
after
they
obtained
by
the
the
political
equality
for
which
they
had
so
long
contended
war
with
the
but
before
this
result
should
be
reached
other
events
of
much
consequence
were
to
occur
the
who
were
not
only
proficients
in
the
arts
but
were
also
active
in
trade
and
commerce
had
been
defeated
at
sea
by
the
greeks
in
but
on
the
north
they
had
a
more
formidable
foe
in
the
by
whom
their
power
was
weakened
the
romans
took
advantage
of
the
situation
to
lay
siege
to
which
after
ten
years
was
captured
by
their
general
furius
the
capture
of
other
towns
followed
it
was
told
of
that
surrendered
to
him
of
its
own
accord
for
his
magnanimity
in
sending
back
a
treacherous
schoolmaster
who
had
taken
out
to
his
camp
the
sons
of
the
chief
citizens
camillas
tied
his
hands
behind
him
and
ordered
the
boys
to
flog
him
back
into
the
city
camillus
was
sent
into
exile
it
was
related
on
a
charge
of
injustice
in
dividing
the
booty
obtained
at
veii
invasion
of
the
but
the
romans
joined
with
the
etruscans
in
the
attempt
to
drive
back
a
dreaded
enemy
of
both
the
in
the
battle
of
the
a
brook
eleven
miles
north
of
rome
on
the
of
july
the
roman
army
was
routed
by
them
and
rome
left
without
the
means
of
defense
all
the
people
fled
except
a
few
brave
men
who
shut
themselves
up
in
the
capitol
and
according
to
the
tradition
some
aged
patricians
who
in
their
robes
of
state
waited
for
the
enemy
the
gauls
under
rushed
in
and
plundered
and
burned
the
city
in
later
times
the
story
was
told
that
when
the
gauls
were
climbing
up
to
the
capitol
secretly
by
night
the
cackling
of
the
geese
awoke
and
so
the
enemy
was
repulsed
there
was
another
story
that
when
the
romans
were
paying
the
ransom
required
by
and
complained
of
false
weight
the
insolent
gaul
threw
his
sword
into
the
scale
exclaiming
woe
to
the
conquered
and
that
just
then
appeared
and
drove
the
gauls
out
of
the
city
this
is
certain
that
the
gauls
retired
of
their
own
free
will
from
their
occupation
of
the
city
the
destruction
of
the
temples
involved
the
loss
of
early
chronicles
which
would
have
given
us
better
information
as
to
the
times
preceding
the
city
was
rebuilt
without
much
delay
the
licinian
the
agitation
for
political
reform
soon
commenced
again
the
which
make
an
epoch
in
the
controversy
of
parties
were
proposed
in
but
were
not
passed
until
besides
provisions
for
the
relief
of
debtors
and
for
limiting
the
number
of
acres
of
public
lands
to
be
held
by
an
individual
it
was
enacted
that
the
military
tribuneship
should
be
given
up
and
that
at
least
one
of
the
two
consuls
must
be
chosen
from
the
plebeians
a
new
patrician
office
the
was
founded
the
holders
of
which
were
to
govern
in
the
absence
of
the
consuls
the
patricians
did
not
at
once
cease
from
the
effort
to
keep
the
reins
in
their
hands
several
times
they
broke
the
law
and
put
in
two
patrician
consuls
they
yielded
at
last
however
and
as
early
as
the
year
all
roman
offices
were
open
to
all
roman
citizens
the
patrician
order
became
a
social
not
a
legal
distinction
a
new
sort
of
nobility
made
up
of
both
patricians
and
plebeians
whose
families
had
longest
held
public
offices
gradually
arose

body

from
those
who
had
held
high
stations
and
were
upwards
of
thirty
years
old
one

required
to
be
a
plebeian
the
condition
of
the
people
was
improved
by
other
enactments

of
which

secured
to
the
debtor
his
personal
freedom
in
case
he
should
transfer
his
property
to
the
creditor
at
about
this
time
there
was
a
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
army
the
sort
of
arms
assigned
was
no
longer
to
depend
on
property
qualifications
there
were
to
be
three
lines

the
long

in

an
invaluable
political
education
it
was
attended
with
little
bloodshed
it
involved
discussion
on
questions
of
justice
and
right
and
on
the
best
civil
constitution
it
was
not
unlike

conflicts
in

the

they
were
brought

with
a
greek
monarch
king
of
epirus
who
was
a
relative
of

and
had
married
into
the
royal
family
of

he
was
a
man

lacking

support

this
was
one
reason
why
the
rich
and
prosperous
dorian
city
on
the
tarentine
gulf
had
been
a
spectator
of
the
contest
in
which
it
had
abundant
occasion
to
feel
a
deep
interest
rome
had
given
up
to
the

the
greek
cities
in

when
they
sought
to
subdue
and
the

besought
the
help
of

offering
to
submit
themselves
to
her
the

warned
the

to
desist
this
led
to

only
the
greek
cities
on

remained
for
them
to
conquer
it
was
high
time
for
to
bestir
itself
it
was
from
the
side
of
tarentum
that
the
immediate
provocation
came
the
tarentines
were
listening
to
a
play
in
the
theater
as
ten
roman
ships
came
into
the
harbor
under
a
sudden
impulse
of
wrath
a
mob
attacked
them
and
destroyed
five
of
them
even
then
the
romans
were
in
no
haste
to
engage
in
hostilities
the
tarentines
themselves
were
divided
as
to
the
policy
best
to
be
pursued
but
the
had
the
more
voices
an
embassy
was
dispatched
to

themselves

alive

were
not

to

service
were
enrolled
the

took
place
at

then
the

the

met
for
the
first

it
was
a

with

it
was
a
struggle
between
the
greek

the
confusion
caused
by
the

of
an
encounter
with

to
understand

it
is
necessary
to
have
a
clear
idea
of
the
roman
system
in
respect
to
citizenship
all
burgesses
of
rome
enjoyed
the

rights
these
were
both

the

all

it

natural
that
they

the

the

city
of
the
jealousy

a

of
the
question
whether

should
enter

untried
path
the
end
of
which
no
man
could
foresee
caused
hesitation
the
assemblies
voted
to
grant
the
request
the
romans
had
begun
as
early
as
to
create
a
fleet
the
ships
which
they
now
used
however

mostly
furnished
by

the

the
former
were
beaten
in

one
of
the
most
characteristic
proofs
of
the
energy
of
the
romans
is
their
creation
of
a

to
match
that
of

said
for
a
model
a
carthaginian
vessel

they
constructed
quinqueremes
vessels
with
five
banks
of
oars
furnished
with
bridges
to
drop
on
the
decks
of
the
hostile
ships
thus
giving
to
a
a
resemblance
to
a
combat

first
as
might
be
expected
the
romans
were
defeated

in
under
the
consul

won
their
first
naval
victory

decided
to

a

of
three

was
met
by
a

completely
vanquished

of

ravaged
the
adjacent
district
there
remained
with
half

army
fifteen
thousand

the

sued
for

but
when

required
them
to
surrender
all
their
ships

except

to
come
into

they
spurned

the
roman
opened
his
toga
saying
i
give
you
war
the
carthaginians
shouted
so
let
it
be
the
second
punic
when
the
treaty
of
was
made
all
patriots
at
carthage
felt
that
it
was
only
a
truce
they
must
have
seen
that
rome
would
never
be
satisfied
with
any
thing
short
of
the
abject
submission
of
so
detested
and
dangerous
a
rival
there
was
a
peace
party
an
oligarchy
at
carthage
and
it
was
their
selfishness
which
ultimately
brought
ruin
upon
the
state
but
the
party
which
saw
that
the
only
safety
was
in
aggressive
action
found
a
military
leader
in
a
leader
not
surpassed
and
perhaps
not
equaled
by
any
other
general
of
ancient
or
modern
times
he
combined
skill
with
daring
and
had
such
a
command
over
men
that
under
the
heaviest
reverses
his
influence
was
not
broken
if
he
was
cruel
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
went
beyond
the
practices
sanctioned
by
the
international
law
of
the
time
and
by
roman
example
when
a
boy
nine
years
old
at
his
father
request
he
had
sworn
upon
the
altar
never
to
be
the
friend
of
the
roman
people
that
father
he
saw
fall
in
battle
at
his
side
the
oath
he
kept
for
rome
never
had
a
more
unyielding
or
a
more
powerful
enemy

and
elephants
he
crossed
the

the
face
of
the

who
disputed

then
made
his
memorable
march
over

now
known
as
the

climbing
over
crags
and
circling
abysses
amid
perpetual
conflicts
with
the
rough
mountaineers
who
rolled
stones
down
on
the
toiling
soldiers
the
army
made
its
terrible
journey
into
northern
italy
fifteen
days
were
occupied
in

half
the

through
the
swampy
district
of
the
where
he
himself
lost
an
eye
flanked
the
defensive
position
of

the

was
decoyed
into
a
narrow
pass
and
in
the
battle

his
army
of
thirty
thousand
men

the

all
was

the

seemed
open
to

but
supported
by
the
latins

italians
the
romans
did
not
quail
or
lower
their
mien

defiance
they

he
was
called
followed
and
watched
his
enemy
inflicting
what
injuries
he

but
avoiding
a
pitched
battle
the
roman
populace
were
impatient
of
the
cautious
but
wise
and
effective
policy
of
in
the
following
year

a
battle
at
in
apulia
where
the
romans
suffered
the
most
terrible
defeat
they
had
ever
experienced
at
the
lowest
computation
they
lost
forty
thousand
foot
and
three
thousand
horse
with
the
consul
and
eighty
men
of
senatorial
rank
no
such
calamity
since
the
capture
of
rome
by
the
gauls
had
ever
occurred
the
roman
senate
did
not
lose
heart
they
limited
the
time
of
mourning
for
the
dead
to
thirty
days
they
refused
to
admit
to
the
city
the
ambassadors
of
who
came
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
with
lofty
resolve
they
ordered
a
levy
of
all
who
could
bear
arms
including
boys
and
even
slaves
they
put
into
their
hands
weapons
from
the
temples
spoils
of
former
victories
they
thanked
that
he
had
not
despaired
of
the
republic
some
of
the
italian
allies
went
over
to
hannibal
but
all
the
latin
cities
and
all
the
roman
colonies
remained
loyal
the
allies
of
rome
did
not
fall
away
as
did
the
allies
of
athens
after
the
syracusan
disaster
it
has
been
thought
that
if
had
followed
up
the
victory
at
by
marching
at
once
on
the
capital
the
roman
power
might
have
been
overthrown
what
might
then
have
been
the
subsequent
course
of
european
history
even
the
roman
according
to
juvenal
discussed
the
question
whether
he
did
not
make
a
mistake
in
not
attacking
rome
but
it
is
quite
doubtful
whether
he
could
have
taken
the
city
or
even
if
he
had
taken
it
whether
his
success
would
then
have
been
complete
he
took
the
wiser
step
of
getting
into
his
hands
the
second
city
in
italy
he
may
have
hoped
to
seize
a
campanian
port
where
he
could
disembark
reinforcements
which
his
great
victories
had
wrung
from
the
opposition
at

judged
it
best
to
go
into
at

his
army
was
in
a
measure
enervated
by
pleasure
and
vice

alliance
with

with
of

since
he
could
obtain
no
substantial
help
from

he
was
obliged
to
act
on

into
sicily
and
after
a
siege
of
three
years
captured

had
been
aided
in
its
defense
by
the
philosopher
in
surrendered
to
the
romans
and
was
visited
with
a
fearful
chastisement
italian
allies
forsook
him
and
his
only
reliance
was
on
his
brother
in
spain
for
a
long
time
the
two
brothers

there

from

by

virtual
subjection

and
obtained
the
support
of

another
grievance
laid
at
the
door
of
this
king
was
the
reception
by
him
of
a
fugitive
from
carthage
whose
advice
however
as

one

among

and
kept
under
surveillance
for
many
years
the
imperious
spirit
of
rome
and
the
deference
accorded
to

is
illustrated
in
the
interview
of
popilius

a
letter
of

directing
him
to
retire
from

a
circle
round
him

him
decide

carthaginians
could
do
nothing
but
at
length
they
were
driven
to
take
up
arms
to
repel
them
this
act
the
romans
pronounced
a
breach
of
the
treaty
that
stern
old
roman
who
in
his
youth
had
served
against
hannibal
porcius
had
been
unceasing
in
his
exhortation
to
destroy
carthage
he
was
in
the
habit
of
ending
his
speeches
with
the
saying
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
carthage
should
be
destroyed
the
roman
armies
landed
at
their
hard
demands
which
included
the
surrender
of

weapons
were
complied
with
but
when
the
carthaginians
were
required
to
abandon
their
city
and
to
make
a
new
settlement
ten
miles
distant
they
rose
in
a
fury
of
patriotic
wrath
the
women
cut
off
their
hair
to
make
bowstrings
day
and
night
the
people
worked
in
forging
weapons

in

the

it
is
remarkable
that
the

still
went

was
by

that
the
foremost
leaders
in

get

the

foreign

were
mainly
at
its
disposal
the
increase
in
the

it
more
easy
for

to

elections
were
carried
by
the
influence
of
largesses
and
by
the
exhibition
of
games
practically
the
chief
officers
were
limited
to
a
clique
composed
of
rich
families
of
both
patrician
and
plebeian
origin
which
was
diminishing
in

while
the
numbers
of
the
lower
class
were
rapidly
growing
larger
the
gulf
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
was
constantly
widening
the
last
italian
colony
was
sent
out
in
and
the
lands
of
italy
were
all
taken
up
slaves
furnished
labor
at

subsistence
it
was
hard

poor
man
to
gain
a

been
carried

the
situation
would
have
been
different
the
public
lands
were
occupied
by
the
members
of
some
forty
or
fifty
aristocratic
families
and
by
a
certain
number
of
wealthy
italians
a
great
proletariate
a
needy
and
disaffected
lower
class
was
growing
up
which
boded
no

this

moved
the

the
effect

would
have
been
to
limit
the
amount
of
the
public
domain
which
any
one
man
could
hold
and
to
divide
portions
of
it
among
poor
citizens
in
spite
of
the
bitter
opposition
of
the
nobility
these
laws
were
passed
but
had
been
obliged
to
persuade
the
people
to
turn
a
tribune
who
resisted
their
passage
out
of
office
which
was
an
unconstitutional
act
in
order
to
carry
out
the
laws
he
would
have
to
be
tribune
but
the
led
by
the
consul
had
been
still
more
infuriated
by
other
proposals
of
they
raised
a
mob
and
slew
him
with
three
hundred
of
his
followers
this
gave
the
democratic
leaders
a
temporary
advantage
but
violent
measures
on
their
own
side
turned
the
current
again
the
other
way
and
proceedings
under
the
laws
were
quashed
caius
the
laws
of
the
brother
of
tiberius
were
of
a
more
sweeping
character
he
caused
measures
to
be
passed
and
colonies
to
be
sent
out
by
decrees
of
the
people
without
any
action
of
the
senate
he
renewed
the
agrarian
law
he
caused
a
law
to
be
passed
for
selling
corn
for
less
than
the
cost
to
all
citizens
who
should
apply
for
it
he
also
caused
it
to
be
ordained
that
juries
should
be
taken
from
the
knights
the
instead
of
the
senate
these
were
composed
of
rich
men
the
tendency
of
the
law
would
be
to
make
the
equestrian
order
distinct
and
thus
to
divide
the
aristocracy
the
proposal
which
was
not
passed
to
extend
the
franchise
to
the
latins
and
perhaps
to
the
italians
cost
him
his
popularity
although
the
measure
was
just
the
senate
gave
its
support
to
a
rival
tribune
livius
who
outbid

hundred
of

was
killed

long
most
of
his
enactments
were
reversed

the
cheap
sale
of
corn
the
most
unwise
of
his
measures
continued
the
jugurthine
an
interval
of
tranquility
followed
but
the
corruption
of
the
ruling
class
was
illustrated
in

with
the

the
adopted

of

king
of

wishing
the
whole

killed
one
of
the
sons
of

late
king
and
made

upon
the
other
who
applied
to
the

for

the
commission
sent
out
by

senate
was
bribed
by

he
took
the
city

put
to

the
remaining
brother

all
his
army
was
he
summoned
to
rome
there
too
his
money
availed
to
secure
him
impunity
although
he
caused
a
numidian
prince
to
be
murdered
in
rome
itself
when
the
romans
finally
entered
on
the
war
with
he
bribed
the
generals
so
that
little
was
effected
the
indignation
of
the
people
was
raised
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
would
not
leave
the
direction
of
the
war
in
the
hands
of
whom
the
senate
had
sent
out
and
who
defeated
but
insisted
on
giving
the
chief
command
to
one
of
his
subordinate
officers
the
son
of
a
peasant
wild
and
rough
in
his
manners
but
of
extraordinary
talents
as
a
soldier
he
brought
the
war
to
an
end
was
delivered
up
by
the
prince
with
whom
he
had
taken
refuge
to
cornelius

of

in
with
his
two
sons

in
chains

the
triumphal
car

streets
of

now
the
leader
of
the
popular
party
and
the
most
influential
man
in
rome
the
cimbri
and
the
power
of
was
augmented
by
his
victories
over
the

the
these
were
hordes
of
barbarians
who
appeared
in
the
alpine
regions

in
different
directions
defeating
through
a
series
of
years
the
roman
armies
that
were
sent
against
them
these
defeats
the
democratic
leaders
ascribed
not
without
reason
to
the
corrupt
management
of
the
aristocratic
party
in
the
and
the
arranged
for
a
combined
attack
on
italy
was
made
consul
and
in
order
to
meet
this
threatened
invasion
which
justly
excited
the
greatest
anxiety
he
was
chosen
to
this
office
five
times
in
succession
having
repulsed
the
attack
of
the
barbarians
on
his
camp
he
defeated
them
in
two
great
battles
the
first
at
aix
in
provence
in
and
the
second
at
in
upper
italy
in
these
successes
which
really
saved
rome
made
for
the
time
the
idol
of
the
popular
party
the
at
about
this
time
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
constitution
of
the
army
the
occupation
of
a
soldier
had
become
a
trade
besides
the
levy
of
citizens
there
was
established
a
recruiting
system
which
drew
into
the
ranks
the
idle
and
lazy
and
a
system
of
by
which
cavalry
and
troops
were
taken
from
subject
and
vassal
states
thus
there
arose
a
military
class
distinct
as
it
had
not
been
of
old
from
the
civil
orders
and
ready
to
act
separately
when
its
own
interest
or
the
ambition
of
favorite
leaders
might
prompt
lacked
the
judgment
and
the
firmness
required
by
a
statesman
especially
in
troublous
times
when
and
brought
forward
a
series
of
measures
of
a
radical
character
in
behalf
of
the
democratic
cause
and
the
consul
who
opposed
them
was
obliged
to
go
into
voluntary
exile
growing
ashamed
of
the
factious
and
violent
proceedings
of
the
popular
party
was
partially
won
over
to
the
support
of
the
senate
when
candidate
for
consul
was
killed
with
bludgeons
by
the
mob
of
and
and
there
was
fighting
in
the
forum
and
the
streets
he
helped
to
put
down
these
reckless
innovators
but
his
want
of
hearty
cooperation
with
either
party
made
him
hated
by
both

to

and
visited
the

of
nearly
ten
years
of
comparative
quiet

the
long
continued
complaints
of
the
italians

at

a
voice
in
the
measures
of
livius

who
in

that
they

the

been
accepted
by
the

but
were
by

declared
null

neither

favorable
to
this
righteous
measure

the
murder
of

the
signal
for
an
insurrection
of

communities
they
organized
for
themselves
a

peril
occasioned

generally
successful

the
south
the

were
at

superior
but
in
in
spite
of
bold
forays
they
were
worsted
but
it
was
by
policy
more
than
by
arms
that
the
romans
subdued
this
dangerous
revolt
they
promised
full
citizenship
to
those
who
had
not
taken
part
in
the
war
and
to
those
who
would
at
once
cease
to
take
part
in
it
finally
when
it
was
plain
that
rome
was
too
strong
to
be
overcome
the
conflict
was
ended
by
granting
to

all
that
they

by

the
cruelty
of

his
victory

more
direful
than
rome
had
ever
witnessed
it
appeared
to
spring
from
no
heat
of
passion
but
was
cold
and
shameless
after
a
few
days
there
was
a
massacre
of
four
thousand
prisoners
in

their
shrieks
and
groans
were
heard
in
the
neighboring

in
consultation
with
the

many
thousands
not

from

next
year
he
retired
from
office
to
his
country
estate
and
gave
himself
up
to
amusements
and
sensual
pleasure
a
part
of
his
time
for
he
was
not
without
a
taste
for
literature
he
devoted
to
the
writing
of
his
memoirs
which
however
have
not
come
down
to

ii
pompeius
and
the

to
the
death
of
crassus

with
not
many
years
after
his
reforms
were
annulled
this
was
largely
through
the
agency
of
who
had
supported
but
was
not
a
uniform
or
consistent
adherent
of
the
aristocratic
party
he
did
not
belong
to
an
old
family
but
had
so
distinguished
himself
that
sulla
gave
him
a
triumph
later
he
rose
to
still
higher
distinction
by
his
conduct
of
the
war
against
in
spain
a
brave
and
able
man
of
the
marian
party
who
was
supported
there
for
a
long
time
by
a

further

a
revolt
among
his
companions
he
called
about
him
slaves
and
outlaws
until
with
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
he
defeated
the
roman
generals
and
threatened
rome

for
two
years
they
ravaged
italy
at
their
will
they
were
vanquished
by

two
battles
in

chief
of
which
was
the
love

on
the
surface
and
if
he
lacked
some
of
the
robust
qualities
of
the
great
roman
leaders
of
that
day
he
was
likewise
free
from
some
of
their
sins
the
captivating
oratory
of
cicero
found
a
field
for
its
exercise
in
the
impeachment
of
whose
rapacity
as
roman
governor
of
sicily
had
fairly
desolated
that
wealthy
province
showed
such
vigor
in
the
prosecution
that
was
driven
into

this
event
weakened
the

two
years
later

committed
to
an
individual
he
was
to
have
absolute
command
over
the
mediterranean
and
its
coasts
for
fifty
miles
inland
he
used
this
unlimited
authority
for

purposes
alone
and
in
three
months
completely
accomplished
the
work
assigned
him
he
captured
three
thousand

ten
thousand
men
twenty
thousand
captives
he
settled
in

interior
of

in
the
the
success
of
pompeius
was
the
prelude
to
a
wider
extension
of
his
power
and
his
popularity
after
the
return

another
the

his
for
a
number
of
years
the
roman
commander
was
successful
but
finally
regained
what
he
had
lost
and
kept
up
his
aggressive
course
in
on
a
motion
that
was
supported
by
but
opposed
by
the
aristocratic
party
in
the
senate
was
made

for
an
indefinite
term
so
extensive

from
the
reigning
prince
and
placed
his
brother
on
the
throne
who
became
tributary
to
rome
with
his
officers
entered
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
and
was
surprised
to
find
there
neither

nor
statue
he
established
in
the
roman
territories
in
asia
the
two
provinces
and
and
the
province
of
several
kingdoms
he
allowed
to
remain
under
roman
protection
after
this
unexampled
exercise
of
power
and
responsibility
as
the
disposer
of
kingdoms
he
slowly
returned
to
italy
dismissed
his
army
at
and
entered
the
capital
as
a
private
citizen
where
in
he
enjoyed
a
magnificent
triumph
that
lasted
for
two
days
the
roman
the
most
coveted
reward
of
a
victorious
general
was
a
triumph
it
was
granted
by
a
vote
of
the
senate
and
according
to
certain
rules
some
of
which
however
were
often
relaxed
the
general
must
have
held
the
office
of
dictator
consul
or
praetor
at
least
five
thousand
of
the
enemy
must
have
been
slain
in
a
single
battle
the
war
must
have
been
against
public
foes
etc
the
general
with
his
army
remained
without
the
city
until
the
triumph
had
been
decreed
by
the
senate
which
also
assembled
without
the
walls
to
deliberate
on
the
question
the
pageant
itself
in
later
times
was
of
the
most
splendid
character
it
consisted
of
a
procession
which
entered
the
triumphal
gate
and
passed
through
the
up
the
capitoline
hill
to
the
temple
of
jupiter
where
sacrifices
were
offered
in
front
were
the
senate
headed
by
the
magistrates
then
came
a
body
of
trumpeters
who
immediately
preceded
the
long
trains
of
carriages
and
frames
which
displayed
the
spoils
of
conquest
including
statues
pictures
gorgeous
apparel
gold
and
silver
and
whatever
else
had
been
borne
away
from
the
conquered
people
pictures
of
the
country
traversed
or
conquered
and
models
of
cities
and
forts
were
exhibited
behind
the
spoils
came
and
these
were
followed
by
elephants
and
other
strange
animals
next
were
the
arms
and
insignia
of
the
hostile
leaders
and
after
them
marched
the
leaders
themselves
and
their
kindred
and
all
the
captives
of
less
rank
in
fetters
the
crowns
and
other
tributes
voluntarily
given
to
the
general
by
roman
allies
next
appeared
and
then
the
central
figure
of
the
procession
the
himself
standing
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
four
horses
clad
in
a
robe
embroidered
with
gold
and
a
flowered
tunic
in
his
right
hand
a
bough
of
laurel
and
in
his
left
a
scepter
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
on
his
brow
and
a
slave
standing
behind
and
holding
a
crown
over
his
head
behind
him
in
the
procession
were
his
family
then
the
mounted
and
the
whole
body
of
the
infantry
their
spears
adorned
with
laurels
making
the
air
ring
with
their
shouts
and
songs
meantime
the
temples
were
open
and
incense
was
burned
to
the
gods
buildings
were
decorated
with
festal
garlands
the
population
in
holiday
dress
thronged
the
steps
of
the
public
buildings
and
stages
erected
to
command
a
view
and
in
every
place
where
a
sight
of
the
pageant
could
be
obtained
as
the
procession
climbed
the
capitoline
hill
some
of
the
captives
of
rank
were
taken
into
the
adjoining
prison
and
barbarously
put
to
death
in
the
lower
chamber
of
that
ancient
dungeon
which
the
traveler
still
visits
and
many
other
conquered
enemies
perished
after
the
sacrifices
had
been
offered
the
sat
down
to
a
public
feast
with
his
friends
in
the
temple
and
was
then
escorted
home
by
a
crowd
of
citizens
the
was
a
lesser
triumph
the
general
entered
the
city
on
foot
and
the
ceremonies
were
of
a
much
inferior
cast
conspiracy
of
meanwhile
at
rome
the
state
had
been
endangered
by
the
combination
of
democrats
and
anarchists
in
the
conspiracy
of
the
plot
of
this
audacious
and
profligate
man
was
detected
and
crushed
by
the
vigilance
and
energy
of
the
consul
whose
four
speeches
on
the
subject
two
to
the
senate
and
two
to
the
people
are
among
the
most
celebrated
of
all
his
orations
was
forced
to
fly
from
rome
and
several
of
his
prominent
accomplices
were
put
to
death
by
the
advice
of
the
younger
the
leader
of
the
senatorial
party
and
by
the
vote
of
the
senate
this
was
done
without
asking
for
the
verdict
of
the
people
and
for
this
reason
was
not
warranted
by
the
law
but
it
was
declared
to
be
needful
for
the
salvation
of
the
state
the
next
year
was
killed
in
battle
and
his
force
dispersed
by
the
army
of
the
senate
a
turn
of
party
feeling
afterwards
exiled
for
departing
from
the
law
in
the
execution
of
the
conspirators
julius
another
person
strong
enough
to
be
the
rival
of
was
now
on
the
stage
of
action
this
was
julius
who
proved
himself
to
be
on
the
whole
the
foremost
man
of
the
ancient
roman
world
caesar
talents
were
versatile
but
in
nothing
was
he
weak
or
superficial
he
was
great
as
a
general
a
statesman
an
orator
and
an
author
with
as
much
power
of
personal
command
over
men
as
had
possessed
he
was
likewise
an
agreeable
companion
of
men
of
letters
and
in
general
society
every
thing
he
did
he
appeared
to
do
with
ease
by
his
family
connections
he
was
naturally
designated
as
the
leader
of
the
popular
marian
party
he
was
the
nephew
of
and
the
of
had
spared
his
life
although
he
had
courageously
refused
to
obey
the
dictator
command
to
put
away
his
wife
but
he
had
been
obliged
to
quit
rome
at
the
funeral
of
the
widow
of
he
had
been
bold
enough
to
exhibit
the
bust
of
that
hero
an
act
that
involved
risk
but
pleased
the
multitude
he
was
suspected
of
being
privy
to
plot
and
in
the
senate
spoke
against
the
execution
of
his
confederates
in
he
was
elected
but
his
profuse
expenditures
in
providing
games
plunged
him
heavily
in
debt
so
that
it
was
only
by
advances
made
to
him
by
that
he
was
able
after
being
praetor
to
go
to
in
where
as
propraetor
he
first
acquired
military
distinction
prior
to
his
sojourn
in
spain
by
his
bold
political
conduct
in
opposition
to
the
senate
and
on
the
democratic
side
he
had
made
himself
a
favorite
of
the
people
the
first
pompeius
was
distrusted
and
feared
by
the
senate
but
on
seeing
that
he
took
no
measures
to
seize
on
power
at
rome
they
proceeded
to
thwart
his
wishes
and
denied
the
expected
allotments
of
land
to
his
troops
the
circumstances
led
to
the
formation
of
the
first
which
was
an
informal
alliance
between
and
against
the
senatorial
oligarchy
and
for
the
protection
and
furtherance
of
their
own
interests
became
consul
in
he
gave
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
gaul
both
cisalpine
and
transalpine
was
given
to
to
govern
for
five
years
was
sent
off
to
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
of
who
was
midway
between
the
two
parties
was
exiled
on
motion
of
the
radical
tribune
but
the
independent
and
violent
proceedings
of
this
demagogue
led
to
more
with
the
senate
was
recalled
a
jealousy
fomented
by
the
senate
sprang
up
between
and
by
efforts
a
better
understanding
was
brought
about
between
the
triumvirs
and
it
was
agreed
that
his
own
proconsulship
should
be
prolonged
for
a
second
term
of
five
years
received
the
and
who
was
avaricious
was
made
proconsul
of
and
commander
of
the
armies
in
the
oriental
provinces
in
an
expedition
against
the
in
he
perished
caesar
in
the
campaigns
of
in
gaul
covered
a
period
of
eight
years
an
admirable
narrative
of
them
is
presented
by
himself
in
his
the
the
gauls
were
the
celts
were
spread
over
the
most
of
gaul
over
britain
and
the
north
of
italy
in
there
were
three
general
divisions
of
people
each
subdivided
into
tribes
these
were
the
the
and
the
the
last
of
whom
however
were
not
celts
but
like
the
in
spain
belonged
to
a
race
the
and
were
in
switzerland
the
celts
of
had
attained
to
a
considerable
degree
of
civilization
their
gods
were
the
various
objects
of
nature
personified
their
divinities
are
described
by
caesar
as
corresponding
in
their
functions
to
the
gods
of
rome
their
priests
were
the
a
close
corporation
but
not
hereditary
they
not
only
conducted
worship
they
were
the
lawgivers
judges
and
physicians
of
the
people
they
possessed
a
mysterious
doctrine
which
they
taught
to
the
initiated
they
held
a
great
yearly
assembly
for
the
trial
of
causes
the
stood
in
connection
with
the
druidical
order
in
worship
human
sacrifices
were
offered
in
large
numbers
the
victims
being
prisoners
slaves
criminals
etc
there
were
temples
but
thick
groves
were
the
favorite
seats
of
worship
says
that
the
gauls
were
strongly
addicted
to
religious
observances
in
their
character
they
are
described
as
brave
and
impetuous
in
an
onset
but
as
lacking
persistency
the
celts
in
were
less
civilized
than
their
kinsfolk
across
the
channel
but
in
their
customs
and
religious
beliefs
and
usages
they
were
similar
to
them
they
probably
came
over
from
gaul
conquest
of
the
first
victory
of
caesar
was
in
conflict
with
the
helvetii
who
had
invaded
gaul
and
whom
he
drove
back
to
their

mainly
in

and
he
was
perhaps
not
unwilling
to

to

taking
with

in

agony

as
to
what

it
was
right
and
best
for
him
to
take
since
he
saw
reason
to
dread
the
triumph

side
reluctantly
he
decided
to
cast
in
his

its
newly

champion
pharsalus

caesar
gained
the
advantage
of
securing
the

which
had
unaccountably
left
behind
him
and
was

his
power
in

pursuing

he
marched
through

conquered
the
pompeian
forces
at

secured
his
hold
upon
that
country
he
then
crossed

he
encountered

who
could
not
manage
his
imprudent
officers
on
the
plain
of
where
the
senatorial
army
was
completely
overthrown
sailed
for
egypt
but
just
as
he
was
landing
he
was
treacherously
assassinated
his
head
was
sent
to
who
wept
at
the
spectacle
and
punished
the
murderers
gained
friends
everywhere
by
the
exercise
of
a
judicious
clemency
which
accorded
with
his
natural
disposition
he
next
went
to
there
he
was
met
by
whose
dazzling
beauty
captivated
him
she
reigned
in
conjunction
with
her
younger
brother
who
according
to
the
egyptian
usage
was
nominally
her
husband
the
egyptians
were
roused
against
caesar
and
on
one
occasion
he
saved
his
life
by
swimming
but
he
finally
defeated
and
destroyed

the

in
that

a
most
powerful
combination
was
made
against
him
in
including
some
of
his
old
officers
and
legionaries
and
the
two
sons
of
but
in
the
battle
at
march
when
caesar
was
himself
in
great
personal
danger
he
was
as
usual
triumphant
caesar
as
a
marvelous
as
the
career
of
caesar
as
a
general
was
his
merit
as
a
civilian
outstrips
even
his
distinction
as
a
soldier
he
saw
that
the
world
could
no
longer
be
governed
by
the
roman
rabble
and
that
monarchy
was
the
only
alternative
he
ruled
under
the
forms
of
the
old
constitution
taking
the
post
of
dictator
and
censor
for
life
and
absorbing
in
himself
the
other
principal
republican
offices
the
whole
tendency
of
his
measures
which
were
mostly
of
a
very
wholesome
character
was
not
only
to
remedy
abuses
of
administration
but
to
found
a
system
of
orderly
administration
in
which
rome
should
be
not
the
sole
but
simply
the
of
the
community
which
had
been
subjected
to
her
authority
the
government
of
caesar
made
the
an
advisory
body
he
increased
the
number
of
senators
bringing
in
provincials
as
well
as
roman
citizens
he
gave
full
citizenship
to
all
the
and
to
numerous
communities
in
in
and
elsewhere
he
established
a
colonization
thus
planting
his
veterans
in
different
places
abroad
and
lessening
the
number
of
proletarians
in
italy
he
rebuilt
and
he
the
army
and
the
civil
administration
in
the
provinces
in
the
space
of
five
years
while
he
was
busy
in
important
wars
he
originated
numerous
governmental
measures
of
the
utmost
value
the
motives
of
the
designs
of
caesar
and
of
his
party
are
to
be
distinguished
from
what
they
actually
accomplished
caesar
was
not
impelled
by
a
desire
to
improve
the
government
of
the
provinces
in
taking
up
arms
against
the
senate
nor
did
he
owe
his
success
to
the
support
of
provincials
although
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
democratic
party
at
rome
he
was
glad
to
have
them
for
allies
the
custom
had
grown
up
of
virtually
giving
to
eminent
generals
absolute
power
for
extended
intervals
this
was
done
for
example
in
the
case
of
on
the
occasion
of
the
invasion
of
the
and
in
such
exigencies
it
was
found
necessary
to
create
what
was
equivalent
to
a
military
dictatorship
the
idea
of
military
rule
became
familiar
the
revolution
made
by
caesar
was
achieved
by
military
organization
and
was
a
measure
of
personal
on
his
part
being
raised
to
the
supreme
power
he
sought
to
rule
according
to
the
wise
and
liberal
ideas
which
were
suggested
by
the
actual
condition
of
the
world
and
the
undesirableness
of
a
continued
domination
of
a
single
city
with
such
a
populace
as
that
of
rome
before
he
could
carry
out
his
large
schemes
he
was
cut
down
assassination
of
caesar
was
tired
of
staying
in
rome
and
was
proposing
to
undertake
an
expedition
against
the
parthians
neither
his
clemency
nor
the
necessity
and
the
merits
of
the
government
sustained
by
him
availed
to
shield
him
against
the
machinations
of
enemies
the
aristocratic
party
detested
his
policy
he
was
suspected
of
aiming
at
the
title
as
well
as
the
power
of
a
king
a
conspiracy
made
up
of
numerous
senators
who
secretly
hated
him
of
other
individuals
influenced
by
personal
spite
and
of
republican
visionaries
like

who
gloried
in
what
they
considered
tyrannicide

on
the
ides
of

come

of
which
at
least
was
fatal
and
fell

of
gentle
reproach

acquiesced
in

government

eulogized

his
administration
but
even
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
the
event
which
left
the
republic
without
a
master
an
amnesty
to
those
who
slew

by
him

a

skillfully
fomented

address

many

in

they
carried

synagogues

there
was
not
wanting
a
preparation
for
such
a

the
union
of
all
the

in
the

had
lessened
the
mutual
antipathy
of
peoples
melted
down
barriers
of

as

as
of

and
weakened
the
pride
of

an
indistinct
sense
of
a
common
humanity

entered
the
breasts
of
men
writers

talked
of
a

a
single
society

made
this
idea
familiar
mankind
it

formed
one
city
along
with
this
conception
precepts
were
uttered
in
favor
of
forbearance
and
fraternal
kindness
between
man
and
man
in
religion
there
was
a
drift
towards
monotheism
the
old
mythological
religion
was
decaying
and
traditional
beliefs
as
to
divine
things
were
dissolving
many
minds
were
yearning
for
something
to
fill
the
void
for
a
more
substantial
ground
of
rest
and
of
hope
they
longed
for
a
goal
on
which
their
aspirations
might
center
and
to
which
their
exertions
might
tend
the
burden
of
sin
and
of
suffering
that
rested
on
the
common
mass
excited
at
least
a
vague
yearning
for
deliverance
the
roman
empire
with
all
its
treasures
and
its
glory
failed
to
satisfy
the
hearts
of
men
the
dreams
of
philosophy
could
not
be
realized
on
the
basis
of
ancient
society
where
the
state
was
every
thing
and
where
no
higher
more
comprehensive
and
more
enduring
kingdom
could
spring
into
being
christ
and
the
four
years
before
the
date
assigned
for
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
was
born
a
tyrannical
king
servile
in
his
attitude
toward
the
romans
and
subject
to
them
was
then
ruling
over
the
jews
in
palestine
but
when
jesus
began
his
public
ministry
the
kingship
had
been
abolished
and
judaea
was
governed
by
the
procurator
jesus
announced
himself
as
the
the
founder
of
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
brethren
having
god
for
their
father
he
taught
in
a
tone
of
authority
yet
with
a
sweet
reasonableness
and
his
wonderful
teaching
was
accompanied
with
marvelous
works
of
power
and
mercy
as
he
went
about
doing
good
he
attached
to
himself
twelve
disciples
among
whom
and
the
two
brothers
and
were
the
men
of
most
mark
these
had
listened
to
the
preaching
of
the
prophet
of
the
wilderness
by
whom
jesus
had
been
recognized
as
the
christ
who
was
to
come
the
ministry
of
the
christ
produced
a
excitement
and
a
deep
impression
upon
humble
and
souls
but
his
rebuke
of
the
ruling
class
the
for
their
formalism
pretended
sanctity
and
enslavement
to
tradition
excited
in
them
rancorous
enmity
his
disappointment
of
the
popular
desire
for
a
political
messiah
chilled
the
enthusiasm
of
the
multitude
many
of
whom
had
heard
him
gladly
after
about
three
years
he
was
betrayed
by
one
of
his
followers
was
accused
of
heterodoxy
and
blasphemy
before
the
jewish
sanhedrim
the
consent
of
pilate
to
his
death
was
extorted
by
a
charge
of
treason
based
on
the
title
of
king
which
he
had
not
refused
and
he
was
crucified
between
two
malefactors
not
many
days
elapsed
before
his
disciples
rallied
from
their
despondency
and
boldly
and
unitedly
declared
before
magistrates
and
people
that
he
had
manifested
himself
to
them
in
bodily
form
in
a
series
of
interviews
at
definite
places
and
times
they
proclaimed
his
continued
though
invisible
reign
his
perpetual
presence
with
them
and
his
future
advent
in
power
in
his
name
and
on
the
ground
of
his
death
they
preached
the
forgiveness
of
sins
to
all
who
should
believe
in
him
and
enter
on
a
life
of
christian
obedience
in
the
year
or
the
death
of
the
first
martyr
at
the
hands
of
a
jewish
mob
for
a
time
dispersed
the
church
at
jerusalem
and
was
one
step
towards
the
admission
of
the
gentiles
to
the
privileges
of
the
new
faith
but
the
chief
agent
in
effecting
this
result
and
in
thus
giving
to
christianity
its
universal
character
and
mission
was
the
apostle
a
converted
pharisee
in
syria
became
the
cradle
of
the
gentile
branch
of
the
church
and
of
the
missions
to
the
heathen
in
which
paul
was
the
leader
while
was
efficient
in
spreading
the
gospel
among
the
jews
in
palestine
and
beyond
its
borders
by
paul
numerous
churches
were
founded
in
the
course
of
three
extended
missionary
journeys
which
led
him
beyond
asia
into
macedonia
greece
and
illyricum
by
him
the
gospel
was
preached
from
jerusalem
to
rome
where
he
died
as
a
martyr
under

or
not
far
from
the
same
time

to
a
credible
tradition
peter
also
was
put
to
death
at
rome
the
preachers
of
the
christian
faith
pursued
their
work
with
a
fearless
and
untiring
spirit
and
met
the
malignant
persecution
of
the
jews
and
the
fanatical
assaults
of
the
heathen
with
patient
endurance
and
with
prayer
for
the
pardon

enlightenment
of
their
persecutors

various
particulars
characteristic
of
roman
ways
have
been
or
will
be
incidentally
referred
to
a
few
special
statements
may
be
given
in
this
place
the
romans
like
the
greeks
built
a
town
round
a
height
or
capitol
where
was
a
stronghold
a
place
of
refuge
here
temples
were
erected
the
or
was
near
by
where
the
courts
sat
and
where
the
people
came
together
to
transact
business
the
dwellings
were
on
the
sides
of
the
hill
or
on
the
plain
beneath
the
streets
were
narrow
the
exterior
of
the
houses
was
plain
they
were
of
brick
generally
covered
with
stucco
and
whitewashed
glass
was
too
costly
to
be
much
used
hence
the
openings
in
the
walls
were
few
when
the
space
became
valuable
as
in
rome
the
houses
were
built
high
the
chief
room
in
the
house
was
the
which
in
earlier
times
was
not
only
the
common
room
but
also
the
bedroom
of
the
family
in
the
primitive
dwellings
it
had
been
the
only
room
a
passage
led
from
it
through
a
into
the
street
in
front
and
on
both
sides
were
apartments
and
in
the
rear
a
walled
court
or
garden
large
houses
had
several
inclosed
courts
rich
men
and
nobles
built
magnificent
palaces
the
walls
of
roman
dwellings
within
were
decorated
with
some
of
which
at
pompeii
are
left
in
all
their
freshness
round
the
were
couches
on
which
those
who
partook
of
the
meal
reclined
in
other
rooms
chairs
were
plentifully
supplied
lamps
were
very
numerous
and
of
beautiful
design
but
the
wick
was
so
small
that
they
gave
but
little
light
there
was
little
furniture
in
the
statues
stood
round
the
walls
of
this
room
if
the
house
were
one
of
the
better
sort
and
in
open
presses
on
the
walls
were
the
images
or
masks
of
the
distinguished
ancestors
of
the
family
at
a
funeral
of
a
member
of
the
household
they
were
worn
in
the
procession
by
persons
representing
the
deceased
progenitors
the
principal
material
of
a
roman
dress
was
woolen
cloth
the
main
article
of
wearing
apparel
for
a
man
was
the
thrown
over
the
shoulders
and
brought
in
folds
round
the
waist

way
to

women
wore
a
long
tunic
girded
about
the
waist
with
a
tunic
and
a
vest
beneath
except
on
a
journey
or
in
an
open
theater
as
a
protection
from
the
sun
neither
men
nor
women
wore
any
covering
on
the
head
women
when
they
walked
abroad
wore
veils
which
did
not
cover
the
face
the
color
and
form
of
the
shoes
varied
with
the
rank
of
the
individual
and
were
significant
of
it
in
the
house
sandals
were
used
order
of
the
interval
from

to
sunset
was
divided
into
twelve
hours
the
seventh
hour
of
the
day
began
at
noon
at
the
third
hour
there
was
usually
a
light
meal
which
was
followed
by
business
or
visits
of
friendship
the
wealthy
roman
was
followed
about
the
city
by
a
throng
of
clients
who
called
on
him
with
their
morning
greeting
before
he
rose
and
received
their
gift
of
food
or
money
at
noon
came
the
or
more
substantial
breakfast
this
was
followed
by
a
short
sleep
in
the
case
of
those
who
were
at
leisure
to
take
it
then
came
games
and
physical
exercise
of
various
sorts
a
favorite
recreation
both
for
young
and
old
was
exercise
was
succeeded
by
the
bath
for
which
the
romans
from
the
later
times
of
the
republic
had
a
remarkable
fondness
in
private
houses
the
bathing
conveniences
were
luxurious
the
emperors
built
magnificent
which
included
gymnasia
and
sometimes
libraries
what
is
now
called
the
turkish
bath
was
very
much
in
vogue
dinner
or
the
the
principal
meal
was
about
midway
between
noon
and
sunset
the
fork
was
not
used
at
the
table
but
only
in
carving
but
spoons
and
sometimes
it
would
appear
knives
were
used
by
the
host
and
his
guests
the
food
was
so
carved
that
it
was
usually
taken
with
the
fingers
at
the
table
the
toga
was
exchanged
for
a
lighter
garment
and
sandals
were
laid
aside
the

been
taken
there
was
in
later
times
the
or
social
under
the
empire
this
became
often
a
scene
of
indecent
revelry
the
roman
was
not
so
likely
as
a
greek
repast
to
be
enlivened
by
flashes
of
intellect
and
of
wit
or
by
music
furnished
by
the
guests
musicians
were
more
commonly
hired
performers
as
were
also
the

two
kinds
of

entirely
out
of
the
hands
of
the

into
the
hands
of
the
husband
or
under
his
control
there
was
frequently
a
religious
rite
but
when
this
did
not
take
place
the
other
customary
ceremonies
were
essentially
the
same
at
the
betrothal
the
prospective
bride
was
frequently
presented
with
a
ring
and
with
some
more
valuable
gift
by
the
man
whom
she
was
to
marry
in
the
household
notwithstanding
the

authority
of

the

an
honored
position
and
an
active
influence
the

republican
period
greeks
took
the
business
of
teaching
largely
into
their
hands
there
were
flourishing
schools

rhetoric
managed
both
by
greek
and
by
latin
teachers

could

to
do

and
other
cities
in
the

their
university
training
were
found
in
the
richer
families
in
great
numbers
they
were
not
only
employed
in
menial
occupations
they
were
clerks
copyists
sculptors
architects
as
well
as
actors
and
singers
the
work
of
the
was
harder
they
were
shut
up
in
the
night
in
large
barracks
made
partly
under
ground
into
which
was
admitted
but
little
light
or
air
they
often
worked
in
chains
in
town
and
country
both
the
unlimited
power
of
the
master
led
to
great
severity
and
cruelty
in
the
treatment
of
slaves
women
as
well
as
men
were
often
guilty
of
brutal
harshness
females
as
well
as
males
were
the
sufferers
the
however
might
be
favored
by
his
master
he
might
be
allowed
to
save
money
of
his
own
and
might
perhaps
buy
his
freedom
or
receive
it
as
a
gift
during
the
holidays
of
the
slaves
were
allowed
unusual
privileges
and
pleasures
the
could
become
citizens
and
were
then
eligible
to
any
office
a
roman
who
sought
office
went
round
soliciting
votes
this
was
called
from
to
go
round
whence
is
derived
the
english
word
he
presented
himself
in
public
places
in
a
toga
specially
whitened
and
was
hence
called
a
from

he
sought
to
get
support

providing

games
the
voting
was
by

magistrates
had
their
seats
of
honor
which
were
made
in
a
particular
shape
in
the
different
forms
used
in
the
trial
of
causes
there
was
one
general
practice
the

laid
down

the
emperors
of
the
augustan
house
during
the
long
reign
of
the
prudent
there
was
peace
within
the
borders
of
the
empire
he
said
of
himself
that
he
found
rome
of
brick
and
left
it
of
marble
this
change
may
be
taken
as
a
symbol
of
the
growth
of
material
prosperity
in
the
roman
dominions
but
in
his
private
relations
the
emperor
was
less
fortunate
his
daughter
a
woman
of
brilliant
talents
disgraced
him
by
her
immorality
and
he
was
obliged
to
banish
her
her
two
elder
sons
died
when
they
were
young
the
empire
devolved
on
his
adopted
who
endeavored
to
continue
the
same
conservative
policy
tiberius
was
at
first
alarmed
by
mutinies
among
the
troops
in
pannonia
and
on
the
rhine
the
army
of
the
rhine
urged
the
emperor
adopted
son
and
probable
successor
to
lead
it
to
rome
promising
to
place
him
on
the
throne
but
succeeded
in
quieting
the
disturbance
as
there
were
during
this
reign
no
great
wars
was
able
to
devote
himself
more
exclusively
to
the
civil
administration
he
transferred
from
the
popular
assembly
to
the
senate
the
right
of
choosing
the
magistrates
emphasizing
in
this
way
the
dual
system
that
augustus
had
created
the
rights
of
the
senate
he
appeared
scrupulously
to
respect
for
the
more
effective
government
of
the
city
of
rome
he
established
there
a
permanent
prefecture
and
brought
together
in
a
camp
before
the
viminal
gate
the
nine
pr√¶torian
cohorts
unhappily
this
pr√¶torian
guard
which
might
serve
to
overawe
the
city
mobs
might
also
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
government
indeed
a
little
later
it
had
to
be
counted
with
in
the
choice
of
emperors
the
notorious
was
prefect
during
a
large
part
of
this
reign
and
acquired
so
completely
the
confidence
of
tiberius
that
he
began
to
plot
his
overthrow
he
had
already
caused
the
son
of
tiberius
to
be
poisoned
in
order
to
remove
one
obstacle
finally
the
emperor
discovered
his
plots
and
caused
him
to
be
arrested
and
put
to
death
for
several
years
tiberius
had
been
living
in
retirement
on
the
island
of
there
his
enemies
represented
him
as
given
over
to
debauchery
while
the
lives
of
roman
citizens
were
never
safe
from
his
suspicions
or
from
the
accusations
of
the
men
who
presented
formal
charges
of
crime
there
being
no
public
prosecutors
earlier
in
his
reign
had
shown
a
serious
purpose
to
improve
the
administration
of
justice
but
with
the
lapse
of
years
he
became
distrustful
and
cruel
he
had
moreover
changed
the
law
of
treason
so
that
to
write
or
speak
slightingly
of
the
emperor
was
interpreted
as
conspiracy
to
bring
the
commonwealth
into
contempt
and
was
punished
with
death
although
he
was
justly
hated
by
the
roman
nobles
in
the
provinces
he
was
respected
because
he
sought
to
protect
them
against
extortion
and
to
foster
their
general
interests
he
died
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
there
was
no
law
for
the
regulation
of
the
succession
but
the
senate
the
pr√¶torians
and
the
people
united
in
calling
to
the
throne
the
son
of
germanicus
this
ruler
called
at
first
mild
and
generous
in
his
doings
soon
rushed
into
such
excesses
of
savage
cruelty
and
monstrous
vice
that
he
was
thought
to
be
he
was
fond
of
seeing
with
his
own
eyes
the
infliction
of
tortures
his
wild
extravagance
in
the
matter
of
public
games
and
in
building
drained
the
resources
of
the
empire
after
four
years
this
madman
was
cut
down
by
two
of
his
guards
whom
he
had
grievously
insulted
the
uncle
and
successor
of
and
the
son
of
drusus
and
antonia
was
not
bad
but
weak
he
was
a
student
and
a
recluse
in
his
habits
his
favorites
and
nearest
connections
were
unprincipled
the
depravity
of
his
wife
was
such
that
he
did
right
in
sanctioning
her
death
the
immoral
and
ambitious
whom
he
next
married
had
an
influence
less
malign
but
she
was
unfaithful
to
her
husband
and
this
fact
together
with
the
fear
she
felt
that
her
son
by
her
first
marriage
would
be
excluded
from
the
throne
impelled
her
to
the
crime
of
taking
the
life
of
by
poison
reigned
from
to
he
was
the
grandson
of
germanicus
and
had
been
the
pupil
of
the
philosopher
and
of
an
excellent
man
the
captain
of
the
pr√¶torian
guard
the
first
five
years
of
nero
reign
were
honorably
distinguished
from
the
portion
of
it
that
followed
when
a
warrant
for
the
execution
of
a
criminal
was
brought
to
him
he
regretted
that
he
had
ever
learned
to
write
his
first
great
crime
was
the
poisoning
of
the
son
of
nero
became
enamored
of
a
fierce
and
ambitious
woman
on
the
basis
of
false
charges
he
took
the
life
of
his
wife
the
daughter
of
claudius
his
criminal
mother
agrippina
after
various
previous
attempts
made
by
him
to
destroy
her
was
dispatched
by
his
command
his
unbridled
cruelty
and
jealousy
moved
him
to
order
one
of
the
men
to
whom
he
owed
most
to
commit
suicide
he
came
forward
as
a
musician
and
nothing
delighted
him
so
much
as
the
applause
rendered
to
his
musical
performances
he
recited
his
own
poems
and
was
stung
with
jealousy
when
he
found
himself
outdone
by
his
eagerness
to
figure
as
a
charioteer
prompted
him
early
in
his
reign
to
construct
a
circus
in
his
own
grounds
on
the
where
he
could
exhibit
his
skill
as
a
coachman
to
a
throng
of
delighted
spectators
at
length
he
appeared
lyre
in
hand
on
the
stage
before
the
populace
senators
of
high
descent
and
matrons
of
noble
family
were
induced
by
his
example
and
commands
to
come
forward
in
public
as
dancers
and
the
public
treasure
he
squandered
in
expensive
shows
and
in
the
lavish
distribution
of
presents
in
connection
with
them
the
has
the
undesirable
distinction
of
being
the
first
of
the
emperors
to
persecute
the
christians
in
a
great
fire
broke
out
at
rome
which
laid
a
third
of
the
city
in
ashes
he
was
suspected
of
having
kindled
it
and
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
he
charged
the
crime
upon
the
christians
who
were
obnoxious
tells
us
on
account
of
their
hatred
of
the
human
race
their
withdrawal
from
customary
amusements
and
festivals
which
involved
immorality
or
heathen
rites
naturally
gave
rise
to
this
accusation
of
cynical
misanthropy
a
great
number
were
put
to
death
and
in
their
deaths
they
were
made
subjects
of
sport
for
they
were
covered
with
the
hides
of
wild
beasts
and
worried
to
death
by
dogs
or
nailed
to
crosses
or
set
fire
to
and
when
day
declined
were
burned
to
serve
for
nocturnal
lights
at
length
a
feeling
of
compassion
arose
among
the
people
for
the
victims
of
this
wanton
ferocity
prior
to
this
time
while
the
christians
were
confounded
with
the
jews
as
one
of
their
sects
they
had
been
more
protected
than
persecuted
by
the
roman
authorities
now
that
they
were
recognized
as
a
distinct
body
the
adherents
of
a
new
religion
not
identified
with
any
particular
nation
but
seeking
to
spread
itself
everywhere
they
fell
under
the
condemnation
of
roman
law
and
were
exposed
to
the
hostility
of
magistrates
as
well
as
to
the
wrath
of
the
fanatical
populace

burnt
over

laid
out
in
regular
streets
leaving

limiting
the
height
of

but
a
large
area
he
reserved
for
his
golden
house

with
its
lakes
and
shady
groves
stretched
over
the
ground
on
which
the
coliseum
afterwards
stood

the

built

of

it
spread
from
the
palatine
the
seat
of
the
original
settlement
over
six
other

so
that
it
became
the
city
of
seven
hills
all
of
them
appeared
higher
than
they
do
now
of
these

of

in
earlier
days
from
a
part
of
the
summit
the
tarpeian
rock
criminals
were
hurled

became
covered
with
public
edifices
of
which
the
grandest
was
the
temple

on

to
economize

the

were
built
very
high
one

street
in

of
all
sorts
of

both
for

the

structures
of

in

were
the

for
three

the
beauty
of

on
a
level
with
the
elegance
of
the

with
the
attraction
of
the
libraries

added
intellectual
pleasure
to
the
physical
comfort
for

mainly
these
gigantic
buildings
were
constructed
besides

was
inevitably
to
harden

talent
where
there

it

natural
that

should
abound
there
was
one

the

about

and
in

and
conciseness
has
seldom

left
to
us
ten
books
of

present
an
agreeable
picture
of

no
ancient
heathen
writer
has
uttered
so
many
thoughts
and
precepts
which
bear
a
resemblance
to
teachings
of
the
new
testament
the
study
that
nourished
most
in
this
period
is
it
is
the
classic
era
of
the
jurists
persons
versed
in
the
law
were
preferred
by
the
emperors
for
high
offices
men
who
would
have
been
statesmen
under
the

found
a
solace
and
delight
in
legal

among
the
most
learned
jurists
of
this
era

of
the
greek
writers
one
of
the
most
important
is
about
whose
lives
and
essays
or
are
among
the
most
delightful
and
instructive
of
all
the
works
of
antiquity
one
of
the
noblest
philosophical
writers
of
that

of
any
other
period
is
the

the
two
most
popular
systems
of
philosophy
in
the
closing
days
of
the
republic
and
the
early
period
of
the
empire
were
the
stoic
and
the
epicurean
the
severity
of
the
stoic
doctrine
was
somewhat
softened
by
its
roman
teachers
but
the
rigorous
the
superiority
to
misfortune
and
the
contempt
of
death
which
it
recommended
found
favor
with
noble
romans
in
dark
days
and
other
champions
of
the
falling
republic
were
disciples
of
this
school
later

mystical
and
contemplative
type
secured
many
adherents
long
before
the
fall
of
the
republic
faith
in
the
old
mythology
had
begun
to
decline
this
change
followed
upon
an
intimate
contact
of
the
romans
with
the
greek
religion
it
was
hastened
by
the
familiarity
acquired
by
the
romans
with
so
great
a
variety
of
heathen
systems
the
decay
of
morality
was
attended
with
a
spread
of
skepticism
as
regards
the
supernatural
world
altogether
in
the
course
of
the
debate
in
the
roman
senate
on
the
punishment
of
the
confederates
of
opposed
their
execution
on
the
ground
that
death
puts
an
end
to
consciousness
and
thus
to
all
suffering
it
does
not
appear
that
in
that
body
where
and
were
present
any
one
disputed
this
tenet
in
his
philosophical
essays
advocates
the
doctrine
of
immortality
by
arguments
mostly
gathered
from
greek
sources
arguments
some
of
which
are
of
more
and
some
of
less
weight
his
correspondence
on
the
contrary
even
in
times
of
bereavement
affords
no
proof
that
this
consoling
truth
had
any
practical
hold
upon
his
convictions
the
spread
of
skepticism
was
attended
as
time
went
on
with
a
to
the
other
extreme
of
superstition
magic
and
sorcery
came
into
vogue
there
was
an
eagerness
to
become
acquainted
with
oriental
religious
rites
and
to
pay
homage
to
deities
worshiped
in
the
east
with
mysterious
ceremonies
another
tendency
strongly
manifest
was
towards
what
is
called
or
a
mingling
of
different
religious
systems
it
was
hoped
that
the
truth
might
be
found
by
combining
beliefs
drawn
from
many
different
quarters
this
eclectic
drift
was
signally
manifest
in

in

been
more
energy
and
virtue
than
in
any
other
class
began
to
decline
in
discipline
society
was
growing
more
and
more
corrupt
it
proves
the
inherent
strength
of
the
organization
of
the
roman
empire
that
amid
all
the
causes
of
disintegration
and
decay
it
lasted
for
two
centuries
longer
emperors
made
by
the
soldiers
we
now
enter
upon
a
period
of
military
license
the
emperors
are
appointed
by
the
soldiers
the
rulers
when
the
soldiers
fall
out
with
them
are
slain
in
the
course
of
years
from
to
emperors
with
an
average
reign
of
less
than
four
years
for
each
sat
on
the
throne
only
two
reigns
exceeded
ten
years
ten
emperors
perished
by
violence
at
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
a
real
advantage
in
this
way
of
making
emperors
was
that
supreme
power
might
thus
devolve
on
able
generals
but
another
and
a
fatal
result
was
the
demoralizing
of
the
armies
by
whose
favor
the
rulers
of
the
state
were
set
up
and
pulled
down
to
alexander
severus
the
assassins
of
commodus
with
the
assent
of
the
praetorians
made
a
worthy
senator
emperor
but
his
honesty
and
frugality
and
his
disposition
to
maintain
discipline
among
the
soldiers
caused
them
to
murder
him
three
months
after
his
accession
it
is
said
that
they
then
sold
the
imperial
office
at
auction
to
a
rich
senator
but
the
leaders
of
the
armies
in
different
regions
refused
their
consent
of
these
made
his
way
to
the
throne
and
put
down
his
rivals
the
empire
became
a
military
despotism
a

of
forty

for
a
short
time

perished
in
consequence
of
his
attempts
to
reform
the
discipline
of
the

was
not
more
cruel
than
others
had
been

his
gross
and
shameless
debauchery
was
without
a

as
in

there
was
a
throng
of
provincials
the

were
disposed
to
nominate
emperors
of
their

it
was
hard
for
the
central
authority
to
keep
under
control
the
frontier
armies
to
add
to
these
sources
of
division
there
was
a
growing
jealousy
between
the
east

to
a
difference
in
language
ideas
and

was
soon
to
threaten
the
empire

alexander

was
a
man
of
pure
morals
and
sincerely
disposed
to
remedy
abuses
and
to
govern
well
but
the
evils
were
too
great
for
the
moderate
degree
of

with
which

was
endowed
the

in

but
for
his
death
was
the
last
in
the
succession
of
rulers
during
this
period
of
military
control
of
which
the
corruption
of
the
army
was
the
worst
result
ii
the
absolute
monarchy
to
once
more
the
gigantic
and
weakened
frame
of
the
roman
empire
was
invigorated
by
a
change
in
the
character
of
the
chief
rulers
and
in
the
method
of
government
one
of
a
number
of
energetic
emperors
who
were
of
illyrian
birth
first
stripped
the
imperial
office
of
its
limitations
and
converted
it
into
an
absolute
monarchy
this
new
system
was
carried
to
its
completion
by
took
from
the
senate
what
political
jurisdiction
was
left
to
it
he
abolished
the
difference
between
the
treasury
of
the
state
and
the
private
coffers
of
the
prince
the
precedence
of
rome
was
taken
away
by
making
other
great
cities
to
be
seats
of
government
there
were
to
be
two
emperors
under
the
title
of
with
two
under
them
and
thus
the
empire
was
divided
for
administrative
purposes
into
four
parts
the
second
augustus
was
to
rule
over
italy
africa
and
the
islands
with
for
his
residence

the
western
provinces
spain
gaul
and
britain
at
a
man
of
imposing
presence
and
of
great
talents
as
a
statesman
exercised
rule
for
twenty
years
with
efficiency
and
success
the
new
system
if
it
involved
the
peril
of
strife
among
the
regents
led
to
a
more
vigilant
and
efficient
government
in
the
different
provinces
and
provided
for
a
peaceful
succession
to
the
throne
but
the
government
came
to
resemble
in
the
omnipotence
of
the
emperor
in
the
obsequious
homage
paid
to
him
and
in
the
cringing
manners
of
the
court
an
oriental
despotism
the
old
heathen
religion
was
considered
by
conservative
romans
to
be
an
essential
part
of
the
imperial
system
and
indispensable
to
the
unity
of
the
empire
it
was
this
view
in
connection
with
other
influences
which
moved
near
the
close
of
his
reign
in
to
set
on
foot
a
systematic
persecution
of
the
christian
church
by
a
series
of
extremely
severe
and
measures
through
which
it
was
designed
to
extirpate
the
new
religion
the
last
great
persecution
in
the
reign
of
cruel
though
it
had
been
did
not
approach
in
severity
this
final
effort
to
exterminate
the
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
who
had
now
become
very
numerous
terrible
sufferings
were
inflicted
but
without
avail
in
diocletian
partly
on
account
of
a
serious
illness
formally
abdicated
and
obliged
to
do
the
same
civil
wars
followed
until
the
son
of
gained
the
supremacy
first
as
joint
ruler
with
who
governed
in
the
east
and
then
after
a
bloody
struggle
which
began
in
as
sole
master
of
the
empire
constantine
the
career
of
was
stained
by
acts
of
cruelty
towards
members
of
his
own
family
in
the
closing
period
of
his
life
he
was
less
just
and
humane
than
in
earlier
days
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
imperial
system
was
signally
manifest
in
his
removal
of
the
seat
of
government
to
constantinople
which
was
built
up
by
him
and
named
in
his
honor
placed
between
europe
and
asia
on
a
tongue
of
land
where
it
was
protected
from
assault
it
was
admirably
suited
for
a
metropolis
but
the
change
of
capital
involved
dangers
for
the
western
portions
of
the
empire
exposed
as
they
were
to
the
assaults
of
the
barbarians
the
changes
in
the
government
begun
by
diocletian
were
completed
by
constantine
the
empire
was
divided
for
purposes
of
government
into
four
each
of
which
was
subdivided
into

likewise
different
classes
of

type
of
modern

in

the
system

and
despotic
administration

subordinate
rulers
which
began

perfected
by
diocletian
in
order
to
fortify
the
imperial
power
against
the

shared
his
power
with
a
cabinet
of
emperors
which
his
genius
enabled
him
to
control
to
prevent
the
breaking
up
of
the
empire
through
the
system
of
viceroys
thus
created
to
preserve
it
constantine
separated
the
civil
authority
from
the
military
as
regards
the
subordinate
rulers
while
both
functions
were
united
in
himself
he
still
further
exalted
his
throne
by
giving
it
even
more
of
an
oriental
character
by
creating
a
multitude
of
officials
who
were
satellites
of
the
sovereign
and
by
becoming
the
secular
head
and
guardian
of
the
christian
church
the
arrangements
of
his
court
with
its
grades
of
officials
from
the
chamberlain
downwards
were
after
the
oriental
pattern
the
downfall
of
heathenism
progress
of
the
failure
of
the
grand
attempt
of
to
exterminate
christianity
was
an
indication
of
its
coming
triumph
its
progress
had
been
gradual
yet
rapid
and
in
its
earlier
stages
especially
obscure
of
the
labors
of
most
of
the
apostles
we
know
little
on
the
approach
of
the
jewish
war
the
apostle
and
other
christians
with
him
had
repaired
to
asia
minor
there
at
this
apostle
lived
until
the
reign
of
and
from
that
center
exerted
a
wide
influence
the
traces
of
which
are
marked
and
various
the
cities
were
the
principal
scenes
of
early
missionary
work
they
were
the
strategic
points
in
them
it
was
easier
for
christian
preachers
to
gain
a
hearing
and
in
them
they
were
exempt
from
the
hindrance
created
by
strange
dialects
wherever
christians
went
even
for
purposes
of
trade
or
mechanical
industry
they
carried
the
seeds
of
the
new
doctrine
even
with
regard
to
the
churches
of
and
which
became
so
flourishing
and
in
the
case
of
the
church
at
itself
we
can
not
say
how
they
were
first
planted
the
exultant
terms
in
which
the
ecclesiastical
writers
at
the
end
and
even
as
early
as
the
middle
of
the
second
century
speak
of
the
increasing
number
of
the
converts
proves
that
the
christian
cause
was
fast
gaining
ground
its
adherents
were
sometimes
of
the
higher
class
but
mostly
from
the
ranks
of
the
poor
persecution
from
the
side
of
the
heathen
began
among
the
populace
always
when
fire
tempest
or
plague
occurred
they
were
ascribed
to
the
wrath
of
the
heathen
gods
at
the
desertion
of
their
altars
and
the
cry
was
for
christian
blood
but
christianity
from
the
time
of
was
an
illegal
religion
magistrates
might
at
any
time
require
christians
to
do
homage
to
the
emperor
bust
or
to
burn
incense
to
the
old
divinities
to
make
a
proselyte
of
a
roman
citizen
or
to
meet
in
private
companies
for
worship
was
unlawful
the
persecutions
by
public
authority
have
been
said
to
be
ten
but
this
number
is
too
small
if
all
of
them
are
reckoned
and
too
large
if
only
those
of
wide
extent
are
included
the
constancy
with
which
even
young
women
and
children
sometimes
endured
the
torture
excited
wonder
in
the
beholders
among
the
more
noted
martyrs
are
bishop
of
antioch
bishop
of
smyrna
who
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
apostle
john
and
was
put
to
death
in
and
the
aged
bishop
of
carthage
one
of
the
leading
ecclesiastics
of
the
time
who
suffered
under
in
the
church
under
the
accession
of
constantine
made
christianity
the
predominant
religion
in
the
roman
empire
his
conversion
was
gradual
more
and
more
he
came
to
rely
for
support
in
his
conflicts
with
his
rivals
upon
the
god
of
the
christians
the
sign
of
the
cross
which
he
said
that
he
beheld
in
the
sky
and
which
led
him
to
make
the
cross
his
standard
may
have
been
an
optical
illusion
occasioned
partly
by
his
own
mental
state
at
the
moment
when
after
prayer
he
was
standing
at
in
the
door
of
his
tent
he
remained
like
many
others
in
that
day
not
without
relics
of
the
old
beliefs
as
is
seen
from
inscriptions
on
his
coins
and
other
evidences
his
own
baptism
he
deferred
until
he
was
near
his
end
on
account
of
the
prevalent
idea
that
all
previous
guilt
is
effaced
in
the
baptismal
water
the
edict
of
unrestricted
toleration
was
issued
from
in
did
not
proscribe
heathenism
he
forbade
immoral
rites
and
rites
connected
with
magic
and
sorcery
but
with
this
exception
heathen
worshipers
were
not
molested
but
the
emperor
gave
his
zealous
personal
countenance
to
the
christian
cause
and
marks
of
his
favor
to
its
adherents
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
which
he
granted
to
the
church
and
its
ministers
he
did
more
than
he
would
have
been
likely
to
effect
by
the
use
of
severity
against
its
adversaries
organization
of
the
the
early
christian
societies
were
little
republics
at
first
under
the
supervision
of
the
apostles
their
organization
shaped
itself
partly
after
the
model
of
the
synagogue
and
partly
from
the
pattern
of
the
civil
communities
and
the
voluntary
associations
about
them
in
the
apostolic
age
a
body
of
or
and
a
body
of
in
each
church
guided
its
affairs
while
the
members
took
an
active
part
in
the
choice
of
their
officers
and
in
the
general
direction
of
ecclesiastical
proceedings
in
the
second
century
when
we
get
a
distinct
view
of
the
churches
after
the
obscure
interval
that
follows
the
age
of
the
apostles
we
find
that
over
the
elders
is
a
whose
office
grows
in
importance
as
the
churches
become
larger
as
the
need
of
more
compact
organization
is
felt
and
as
the
clergy
become
more
and
more
distinct
from
the
laity
the
bishop
of
the
city
church
acquires
jurisdiction
over
the
adjacent
country
churches
the
bishop
in
the
capital
of
each
province
comes
to
exercise
a
certain
superintendence
within
the
province
this
is
the
system
more
and
more
the
bishops
of
the
great
cities
especially
and
exercise
a
parallel
supervision
in
larger
divisions
of
the
empire
this
is
the
system
as
early
as
the
closing
part
of
the
second
century
the
catholic
or
universal
church
presents
itself
before
us
conceived
of
as
a
unity
which
is
made
such
by
the
hierarchy
of
bishops
and
by
connection
with
the
apostolic
sees
the
churches
founded
by
the
apostles
in
person
as
the
apostles
were
thought
of
as
having
a
head
in
the
bishops
of
rome
who
were
looked
on
as
his
successors
had
accorded
to
them
a
precedence
over
other

strength
of

services
to

considerations

of

numerous
defenses
of

now
addressed
to

rulers
and
now
to

the
most

in

about

middle
of
the
second
century
by
are
specially
instructive
as
to
the
state
of
christian
opinion
and
the
customs
of
the
church
the
first
great
center
of
theological
activity
was
where
philosophy
was
studied
in
a
liberal
spirit
in
the
east
the
questions
relative
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
and
the
relation
of
the
divine
to
the
human
nature
engrossed
attention
in
the
west
it
was
the
practical
aspects
of
theology
the
doctrine
of
sin
and
of
the
deliverance
of
the
will
by
grace
which
were
chiefly
discussed
the
controversy
grew
out
of
the
assertion
by
a
presbyter
of
alexandria
that
jesus
was
the
of
all
beings
the
instrument
of
the
creation
of
all
other
beings
but
himself
a
creature
the
leader
of
the
orthodox
opposition
to
this
opinion
was
the
famous
alexandrian
archdeacon
afterwards
bishop
this
debate
it
was
which
led
to
the
assembling
under
the
auspices
of
of
the
of
the
first
of
a
series
of
general
councils
for
the
adjudication
of
doctrinal
disputes
that
were
held
in
this
and
the
following
centuries
the
arian
doctrine
was
condemned
at
nicaea
and
after
a
long
contest
in
the
period
subsequent
was
finally
determined
to
be
heretical
in
the
west
the
main
controversy
was
that
raised
by
respecting
the
power
of
the
will
the
native
character
of
men
and
the
agency
of
god
in
their
conversion
in
this
debate
the
most
eminent
theologian
of
the
west
bishop
of
in
north
africa
was
the
renowned
champion
of
the
doctrine
of
against
what
he
considered
an
exaggerated
assertion
of
pelagianism
was
condemned
in
the
west
and
nominally
in
the
east
where
views
intermediate
between
the
pelagians
and
augustinians
commonly
prevailed
the
most
eminent
scholar
contemporary
with
augustine
was
who
died
in
the
author
of
the
latin
version
of
the
scriptures
called
the
preceding
augustine
in
north
africa
early
in
the
third
century
was
a
vigorous
and
fervid
writer
who
first
made
latin
the
vehicle
of
theological
discussion
and
a
little
later
whose
works
relate
chiefly
to
church
unity
and
hierarchical
government
of
which
he
was
a
devoted
champion
late
in
the
second
century
bishop
of
lyons
in
gaul
one
of
the
most
eminent
ecclesiastics
of
that
day
composed
an
elaborate
work
against
the
gnostic
heresies
had
known
a
disciple
of
john
the
apostle
christian
passing
within
the
sphere
of
christian
life
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
christianity
exerted
a
power
of
which
there
had
been
no
experience
before
in
reforming
the
character
and
conduct
of
those
even
who
had
been
addicted
to
crime
and
vice
the
fraternal
feeling
of
christians
for
one
another
impressed
the
heathen
about
them
as
something
new
and
singularly
attractive
it
expressed
itself
in
unstinted
charity
for
those
in
poverty
and
in
helpfulness
for
all
sorts
of
distress
the
church
was
a
home
for
the
weary
and
friendless
in
the
strong
reaction
against
the
sensuality
of
a
dissolute
society
ascetic
tendencies
appeared
which
in
process
of
time
issued
in
monasticism
of
thebes
born
about
was
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
celebrated
of
the
who
chose
a
hermit
life
and
abjured
all
the
luxuries
of
life
and
most
of
the
comforts
which
belong
to
social
existence
to
the
succeeded
the
societies
of
monks
who
dwelt
in
a
common
habitation
under
fixed
rules
and
these
were
naturally
followed
by
of
such
communities
under
one
organization
the
monastic
vows
were
or
the
renunciation
of
property
or
abstinence
from
marriage
and
to
the
conventual
superior
sometimes
in
the
early
centuries
great
evils
and
abuses
sprang
up
in
connection
with
monastic
life
for
example
monks
might
become
fanatical
and
violent
but
they
furnished
numerous
examples
of
sincere
piety
and
of
unselfish
and
intrepid
for
the
welfare
of
others
changes
in
as
the
church
grew
in
numbers
and
wealth
costly
edifices
were
constructed
for
worship
the
services
within
them
became
more
elaborate
at
length
art
was
called
in
to
adorn
the
christian
sanctuaries
sculpture
and
painting
were
enlisted
in
the
work
of
providing
aids
to
devotion
relics
of
saints
and
martyrs
were
cherished
as
sacred
possessions
religious
observances
were
multiplied
and
the
church
under
the
christian
emperors
with
its
array
of
clergy
and
of
imposing
ceremonies
assumed
much
of
the
stateliness
and
visible
splendor
that
had
belonged
to
the
heathen
system
which
it
had
supplanted
last
days
of
when
christianity
had
become
powerful
its
disciples
forgot
the
precepts
of
their
master
and
sometimes
persecuted
the
heathen
christian
mobs
demolished
the
old
temples
the
great
temple
of
in
was
destroyed
and
the
statue
of
the
god
was
broken
in
pieces
made
the
celebration
of
heathen
rites
a
capital
offense
and
confiscated
the
property
by
which
heathen
worship
had
been
supported
arians
too
he
persecuted
but
with
less
harshness
the
eastern
emperor
suppressed
the
school
of
new
platonic
philosophers
at
athens
and
banished
the
teachers
heathenism
lingered
in
remote
districts
and
was
hence
called
or
the
religion
of
rustics
the
last
adherents
of
the
ancient
religion
inhabited
in
the
seventh
century
remote
valleys
of
the
italian
islands
the
oracles
were
for
ever
dumb
the
old
divinities
were
never
more
to
be
invoked
but
it
was
not
by
force
that
heathenism
was
extirpated
if
it
had
not
lost
its
vitality
it
would
have
survived
the
penal
laws
against
it
it
perished
by
the
expulsive
energy
of
a
better
faith
causes
of
the
triumph
of
the
causes
of
the
spread
and
triumph
of
christianity
lie
ultimately
in
the
need
which
men
feel
of
religion
especially
in
times
of
dread
and
distress
and
in
the
intrinsic
excellence
which
was
felt
to
belong
to
christianity
in
the
first
and
second
centuries
the
dreary
feeling
engendered
by
the
hollow
skepticism
that
prevailed
was
favorable
to
the
christian
cause
there
was
a
void
to
be
filled
and
the
gospel
came
to
fill
it
in
the
third
century
when
the
progress
of
christianity
was
specially
rapid
there
was
a
perceptible
revival
of
religious
feeling
among
the
heathen
and
this
too
operated
to
the
advantage
of
the
gospel
at
least
it
must
have
done
so
in
numerous
instances
in
that
century
the
terrible
plagues
which
desolated
the
empire
with
the
sufferings
that
sprung
from
wild
anarchy
and
misgovernment
made
the
church
a
welcome
asylum
for
the
afflicted
in
the
place
christianity
was
a
religion
it
was
neither
a
merely
speculative
nor
a
merely
moral
system
it
took
hold
of
the
supernatural
it
presented
to
a
corrupt
society
a
moral
ideal
of
spotless
perfection
it
offered
in
the
doctrine
of
the
cross
a
welcome
solace
consolation
in
life
with
a
sense
of
reconciliation
and
the
hope
of
everlasting
good
other
causes
such
as
enumerates
were
operative
but
these
are
themselves
mostly
or
of
the
gospel
or
they
were
not
causes
christianity
and
the
founders
of
christianity
had
no
thought
of
becoming
the
authors
of
a
political
revolution
they
had
a
very
different
purpose
in
view
to
overthrow
the
existing
order
of
society
would
have
been
equally
unwise
and
impracticable
what
was
needed
was
a
new
spirit
of
justice
and
of
love
the
virtues
that
were
called
for
then
were
the
virtues
gentleness
forbearance
the
calm
endurance
of
ills
of
which
there
was
no
present
remedy
the
christian
spirit
therefore
did
not
evoke
in
the
disciples
of
the
new
faith
sentiments
of
liberty
akin
to
those
which
had
belonged
to
greek
and
roman
heroes
indirectly
however
christianity
brought
into
human
society
the
germs
of
liberty
in
the
place
while
it
enjoined
absolute
submission
to
rulers
it
made
an
exception
whenever
their
commands
should
require
disobedience
to
god
law
this
position
involved
the
denial
to
the
state
of
that
absolute
supremacy
accorded
to
it
by
the
ancients
the
allegiance
to
the
state
became
a
allegiance
there
arose
within
the
state
another
community
which
took
into
its
hands
to
a
large
extent
the
regulation
of
social
life
the
boundaries
of
the
two
authorities
might
be
indistinct
but
there
was
a
real
division
of
control
between
them
it
is
true
that
tyranny
might
arise
within
the
christian
organization
itself
still
its
very
existence
planted
on
the
earth
a
principle
of
liberty
which
was
destined
ultimately
to
work
out
the
destruction
of
all
tyranny
whether
civil
or
religious
for
the
first
time
the
rulers
of
the
roman
world
were
faced
by
an
opposition
meek
yet
too
inflexible
for
all
their
power
to
overcome
this
is

first
stage
in
the
history
of
modern
liberty

heroic
and
invincible

upon
them
the
conquered
became
the
teachers
and
civilizers
of
the
conquerors
secondly
the
christian
church
which
outlived
the
wreck
of
the
empire
and
was
almost
the
sole
remaining
bond
of
social
unity
not
only
educated
the
new
nations
but
regulated
and
guided
them
to
a
large
extent
in
secular
as
well
as
religious
affairs
thus
out
of
chaos
christendom
arose
a
single
homogeneous
society
of
peoples
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
that
the
pontifical
authority
reached
its
full
stature
the
holy
see
exercised
the
lofty
function
of
arbiter
among
contending
nations
and
of
leadership
in
great
public
movements
like
the
crusades
civil
authority
and
ecclesiastical
authority
emperors
and
popes
were
engaged
in
a
long
conflict
for
predominance
thus
there
are
three
elements
which
form
the
essential
factors
in
medi√¶val
history
element
the
element
with
its
law
and
civil
polity
and
with
what
was
left
of
ancient
arts
and
culture
and
the
or
element
as
we
approach
the
close
of
the
medi√¶val
era
a
signal
change
occurs
the
nations
begin
to
acquire
a
more
defined
individuality
the
superintendence
of
the
church
in
civil
affairs
is
more
and
more
renounced
or
relinquished
there
dawns
a
new
era
of
invention
and
discovery

chapter
i
causes
of
the
fall
of
the
western
empire
the
teutonic
confederacies
gradual
overthrow
of
the
when
we
speak
of
the
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
by
the
barbarians
we
must
not
imagine
that
it
was
sudden
as
by
an
earthquake
it
was
gradual
had
the
empire
not
been
undermined
from
within
it
would
not
have
been
overthrown
from
without
the
roman
armies
were
recruited
by
bringing
numerous
barbarians
into
the
ranks
at
length
whole
tribes
were
suffered
to
form
permanent
settlements
within
the
boundaries
of
the
empire
a
king
with
his
entire
tribe
would
engage
to
do
military
service
in
exchange
for
lands
more
and
more
both
the
wealth
and
the
weakness
of
rome
were
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
the
germanic
nations
their
cupidity
was
aroused
as
their
power
increased
meantime
the
barbarians
were
learning
from
their
employers
the
art
of
war
and
were
gaining
soldierly
discipline
their
brave
warriors
rose
to
places
of
command
they
made
and
unmade
the
rulers
and
finally
became
rulers
themselves
another
important
circumstance
is
that
most
of
the
germanic
tribes
were
converts
to
christianity
before
they
made
their
attacks
and
subverted
the
throne
of
the
c√¶sars
in
fine
there
was
a
long
preparation
for
the
great
onset
of
the
barbarian
peoples
in
the
fifth
century
causes
of
the
fall
of
the
but
the
success
of
the
barbarian
invasions
presupposes
an
internal
decay
in
the
empire
it
was
one
symptom
of
a
conscious
decline
that
the
conquering
spirit
was
chilled
and
the
policy
was
adopted
of
fixing
the
limits
of
the
roman
dominion
at
the
rhine
and
the
danube
rome
now
stood
on
the
defensive
the
great
service
of
the
imperial
government
for
which
it
was
most
valued
was
to
protect
the
frontiers
this
partly
accounts
for
the
consternation
of
when
in
the
forests
of
germany
the
legions
of
were
destroyed
the
essential
fact
is
that
rome
became
unable
to
keep
up
the
strength
of
its
armies
there
were
lacking
the
men
to
fill
up
the
legions
the
civil
wars
had
reduced
the
population
in
italy
and
in
other
countries
the
efforts
of
to
encourage
marriage
by
bounties
proved
of
little
avail
the
class
of
independent
italian
yeomen
which
had
made
up
the
bone
and
sinew
of
the
roman
armies
passed
away
slavery
supplanted
free
labor
in
the
third
century
terrible
plagues
swept
over
the
empire
in
a
frightful
pestilence
broke
out
from
which
according
to
the
ancient
world
never
recovered
it
was
only
the
first
in
a
series
of
like
appalling
visitations
the
death
of
liberty
carried
after
it
a
loss
of
the
virtue
the
virile
energy
by
which
rome
had
won
her
supremacy
the
new
imperial
system
after
effective
as
it
was
for
maintaining
an
orderly
administration
drained
the
resources
of
the
people
the
municipal
government
in
each
town
was
put
into
the
hands
of
or
the
owners
of
a
certain
number
of
acres
they
were
made
responsible
for
the
taxes
which
were
levied
in
a
gross
amount
upon
the
town
the
or
financial
administration
of
the
empire
was
so
managed
that
the
civil
offices
became
an
intolerable
burden
to
those
who
held
them
yet
it
was
a
burden
from
which
there
was
no
escape
one
result
was
that
while
slaves
were
often
made
that
is
tillers
or
tenants
sharing
with
the
owner
the
profits
of
tillage
and
thus
had
their
condition
improved
many
freeholders
sank
to
the
same
grade
which
was
a
kind
of
serfdom
when
to
the
exhausting
taxation
by
government
there
were
added
the
disposition
of
large
proprietors
to
despoil
the
poorer
class
of
landholders
and
from
time
to
time
the
predatory
incursions
of
barbarians
the
small
supply
of
roman
legionaries
is
easily
accounted
for
three
races
of
while
the
empire
as
regards
the
power
of
was
sinking
the
barbarians
were
not
only
profiting
by
the
military
skill
and
experience
of
the
romans
but
were
forming
military
among
their
several
tribes
in
the
east
there
was
one
civilized
kingdom
the
successor
of
the
parthian
kingdom
but
not
powerful
enough
to
be
a
rival
certainly
not
in
an
aggressive
contest
but
northward
and
northeast
of
the
roman
boundaries
there
stretched
a
vague
and
unexplored
waste
of
barbarism
a
vast
chaos
of
numberless
barbarous
tongues
and
savage
races
a
commotion
among
these
numerous
tribes
the
uncounted
multitudes
spreading
far
into
the
plain
of
central
asia
had
begun
as
early
as
the
days
of
julius
caesar
they
were
made
up
of
three
races
the
or
peoples
eastward
of
them
the
and
farther
beyond
the
asiatic
the
slavonians
an
aryan
branch
like
the
teutons
had
their
abodes
in
the
space
between
germany
and
the
volga
they
were
a
pastoral
and
an
agricultural
race
of
whose
religion
little
is
known
their
incursions
and
settlements
belong
to
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
and
to
the
history
of
the
eastern
empire
teutonic
of
the
confederacies
of
german
tribes

are
first
to
be
mentioned
in
the
third
century
they
had
spread
over
the
immense
territory
between
the
baltic
and
the
black
seas
they
were
divided
into
the
west
goths
and

their
force
was
augmented
by
the
junction
of
kindred

of
them
towards

a
tribe
of
mixed
race
the
in
the
third
century
the
goths
had
made
their
terrible
inroads
into
and
and
the
brave
emperor
had
perished
in
the
combat
with
them
they
had
pushed
their
marauding
excursions
as
far
as
the
coasts
of
greece
and
ionia
in
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
they
were
united
with
their
allied
tribes
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
east
gothic
chieftain
a
second
league
of
germanic
peoples
was
the
which
included
the
formidable
tribes
called
by
c√¶sar
the
and
who
after
various
incursions
had
established
themselves
on
the
upper
rhine
in
what
is
now
baden
w√ºrtemberg
and
in
switzerland
and
in
the
region
southward
to

of

invasion
of

when
they
poured
through
the
passes
of

penetrated
as
far
as
was

other
peoples
of
teutons
all
but
a
separate
branch
of
the
teutonic
household
to
bold
and
warlike
tribes
now
banded
together
such
as
were
the
franks
and
the
alemanni
the
rhine
with
its
line
of
roman
cities
and
fortresses
could
form
no
permanent
barrier
when
they
crossed
it
they
might
be
driven
back
but
this
was
only
to
renew
their
expeditions
at
the
first
favorable
moment
the
prey
which
they
saw
near
by
and
of
which
they
dreamed
in
the
distance
was
too
enticing
no
more
could
the
danube
fence
off
the
thronging
nations
all
of
whom
had
heard
and
some
of
whom
had
beheld
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
the
civilized
lands
beginning
at
the
and
moving
westward
along
the
line
of
the
and
the
we
find
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
that
the
six
most
prominent
names
of
tribes

over

vast

the
scythian
or
turanian
group
of
nations
habits
of
the
we
have
notices
of
the
germans
from
the
most
full
description
of
them
in
the
of
they
were
tall
and
robust
and
seemed
to
the
romans
who
were
of
smaller
stature
as
giants
tacitus
speaks
of
their
fiercely
blue
eyes
they
lived
in
huts
made
of
wood
and
containing
the
cattle
as
well
as
the
family
they
tilled
the
soil
but
their
favorite
employments
were
war
and
the
chase
capable
of
cruelty
they
were
still
of
a
kindly
temper
and
fond
of
feasts
and
social
gatherings
where
they
were
apt
to
indulge
in
excessive
drinking
and
in
gambling
they
were
brave
and
not
without
a
delicate
sense
of
honor
family
ties
were
sacred
the
women
were
chaste
and
were
companions
of
their
husbands
although
subject
to
them
most
of
the
people
were
who
were
and
carried
arms
the
nobles
were
those
of
higher
birth
but
with
no
special
privileges
the
freemen
owned
who
were
either
criminals
or
persons
who
had
lost
their
freedom
in
gaming
or
prisoners
of
war
there
were
also
or
who
held
land
of
a
superior
many
freedmen
lived
apart
but
many
were
gathered
in
villages
the
land
about
a
village
was
originally
held
in
common
each
village
had
a
chief
and
each
collection
of
villages
or
possessed
a
chief
of
high
rank
and
there
was
a
king
or
head
of
the
tribe
all
these
chieftains
were
elected
by
the
freemen
at
assemblies
periodically
held
when
the
duke
or
general
was
chosen
he
was
raised
on
a
shield
on
the
shoulders
of
the
men
the
judges
in
the
trial
of
causes
sat
with
assessors
or
jurymen
around
them
in
the
open
air
but
private
injuries
were
avenged
by
the
individual
or
by
his
family
one
marked
characteristic
of
the
germans
was
the
habit
of
devoting
themselves
to
the
service
of
a
military
leader
they
paid
to
him
personal
allegiance
and
followed
him
in
war
the
germans
were
above
all
distinguished
by
a
strong
sense
of
personal
independence
if
their
mode
of
living
resembled
outwardly
that
of
other
savage
races
yet
in
their
free
political
life
and
in
the
noble
promise
of
their
language
even
in
its
rudiments
the
comparison
does
not
hold
in
their
faithfulness
courage
and
personal
purity
they
are
emphatically
contrasted
with
the
generality
of
barbarous
peoples
religion
of
the
we
know
more
of
the
scandinavian
religion
through
the
the

only
to
retreat
when
the

represented
to

how
numerous
was
the

he
answered
the
thicker

the

it

mowed
but
he
consented
to
accept

an

rome

the
scattering

up

his

very
soon
in

he
was
slain
by

either
from

because
he
suspected

was
plotting

from
this
time
the
long
reign

was
one
of
justice
and
of

by
negotiation
than
by

he
accused

adjudged
him
to

while
in

at

this
cultivated
man
whom
theodoric
had
highly
esteemed
composed
a
work
on
the
consolations
of
philosophy
which
has
made
his
name
immortal
in

the
course
of

drew
upon
him
the

soon
after

him
their
devoted

the

clovis
forced
the

to

controversy
on
image
the
period
of
theological
debate
when
at
its
height
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
whatever
extravagances
of
doctrinal
zeal
attended
it
dealt
with
themes
of
grave
importance
and
controversy
was
often
waged
by
men
of
high
ability
and
moral
worth
after
that
time
there
succeeded
to
the
tempest
an
intellectual
stagnation
under
the
blighting
breath
of
despotism
coupled
with
the
effect
of
a
lassitude
the
natural
sequel
of
the
disputation
but
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
a
new
controversy
took
place
which
convulsed
the
eastern
empire
and
extended
to
the
west
the
matter
in
dispute
was
the
use
of
images
in
worship
pictorial
representations
had
been
gradually
introduced
in
the
earlier
centuries
but
had
been
opposed
especially
in
egypt
and
in
the
african
church
after
the
time
of
they
came
by
degrees
into
universal
use
this
formed
a
ground
of
reproach
on
the
part
of
the
the
warfare
upon
images
was
begun
by
the
isaurian
a
rough
soldier
with
no
appreciation
of
art
who
issued
an
edict
against
them
the
party
of
or
had
numerous
adherents
and
the
opposite
party
of
who
had
a
powerful
support
from
the
monks
in
the
convents
were
ardent
and
inflexible
in
withstanding
the
imperial
measures
neither
the
remonstrances
of
of
the
last
of
the
greek
fathers
nor
of
the
roman
bishop
made
an
impression
on
the
agitation
spread
far
and
wide
subsequent
emperors
followed
in
his
path
at
length
however
the
empress
restored
and
in

empress
finally
confirmed
this
act
in
the
controversy
religious
motives
were
active
but
they
were
mingled
on
both
sides
with
political
considerations
the
alienation

the
part

in

in

he
became

agent
of
a
wealthy
widow
made
journeys
for
her
into

where
he
may
have
received

from

time
married

he
is
described
as
having
a
commanding
presence
with
piercing
eyes
fluent
in

with

he

retiring
for

to
the
lonely
and
desolate
a

sense
of
the
being
of

almighty
god

of
his
own
responsibility
to

entered
into
his
soul
a
tendency
to
hysteria
in
the
east
a
disease
of
men
as
well
as
of
women
and
to
epilepsy
helps
to
account
for
extraordinary
states
of
body
and
mind
of
which
he
was
the
subject
at
first
he
ascribed
his
strange
ecstasies
or
hallucinations
to
evil
spirits
especially
on
the
occasion
when
an
angel
directed
him
to
begin
the
work
of
prophesying
but
he
was
persuaded
by
that
their
source
was
from
above
he
became
convinced
that
he
was
a
prophet
inspired
with
a
holy
truth
and
charged
with
a
sacred
commission
his
wife
was
his
first
convert
his

he
called

signifies
resignation
to
the
divine
will
his
cousin
his
friend
and
a
few
others
believed
in
him
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
materials
of
creed
were
drawn
from
jewish
and
christian
sources
was
the
whose
pure
monotheism
he
claimed
to
but
the
animating
spirit
was
from
within
the
sum
of
his
doctrine
was
that
there
is
only
one
god
and
that
mohammed
is
the
apostle
of
god
after
the
the
the
rulers
and
the
elders
persecuted
him
they
flung
out
the
reproach
that
his
adherents
were
from
the
poor
or
from
the
rank
of
slaves
this
provoked
him
to
denounce
them
and
to
threaten
them
with
the
divine
judgment
and
with
perdition
he
lost
his
uncle
in
his
wife
had
died
before
he
had
found
sympathy
with
his
claims
from
pious
men
from
they
offered
him
an
asylum
thither
he
went
in
the
date
of
his
or
flight
from
mecca
from
which
the
mohammedan
calendar
is
reckoned
at
medina
he
won
influence
he
was
frequently
resorted
to
as
an
adviser
and
as
a
judge
to
settle
disputes
his
activity
in
this
direction
was
beneficent
his
injunctions
respecting
the
rights
of
property
and
the
protection
due
to
women
were
in
the
main
discreet
and
wholesome
naturally
and
speedily
he
became
a
political
leader
as
well
as
a
religious
reformer
this
new
course
on
which
he
entered
made
a
breach
between
him
and
the
whom
he
had
hoped
to
conciliate
he
drew
off
from
fellowship
with
them
made
the
principal
day
of
public
worship
and
mecca
its
principal
seat
for
the
jewish
fast
he
substituted
the
month
of
his
plan
was
to
cement
together
the
arab
tribes
superseding
the
old
tie
of
blood
by
the
new
bond
of
fellowship
in
adherence
to
him
the
project
of
a
holy
war
to
conquer
and
to
crush
the
idolaters
and
to
establish
his
own
authority
was
the
means
to
this
end
was
the
first
object
of
assault
he
attacked
and
plundered
a
meccan
caravan
in
the
next
year
he
defeated
the

the
battle
of
in
the
battle
of
his
followers
were
worsted
other
conflicts
ensued
with
attacks
on
the
in
the
intervals
until
in
he
entered
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
and
destroyed
all
the
idols
this
event
secured
the
adhesion
of
the
arabian
tribes
together
with
the
chiefs
of
and
of
the
other
more
civilized
districts
hearing
that
the
emperor
was
proposing
to
attack
him
he
went
forth
to
meet
him
but
found
that
the
rumor
was
false
he
was
preparing
a
new
expedition
against
the
when
he
died
in
character
of
from
the
time
of
the
flight
of
mohammed
to
medina
the
prophet
turned
more
and
more
into
the
politician
under
the
circumstances
this
was
perhaps
an
almost
inevitable
change
but
one
consequence
was
the
bringing
out
of
his
natural
vindictiveness
and
the
transformation
of
the
enthusiast
into
the
fanatic
beginning
as
the
prophet
of
arabia
he
came
to
think
that
he
was
the
prophet
of
the
whole
world
there
was
a
call
to
a
wider
warfare
against
idolatry
a
crusade
partly
political
and
partly
religious
involved
a
mixture
of
craft
and
cruelty
which
exhibit
his
character
in
a
new
light
yet
it
is
probable
that
he
always
sincerely
felt
that
his
work
in
general
was
one
to
which
he
was
called
of
god
even
the
prosaic
regulations
and
orders
of
the
day
which
are
placed
in
the
if
not
the
reproduction
in
cataleptic
visions
of
his
previous
thoughts
may
have
been
regarded
by
him
as
having
a
divine
sanction
the
extent
of
possible
in
so
extraordinary
a
combination
of
qualities
it
is
not
easy
to
define
his
conduct
was
for
the
most
part
on
a
level
with
his
precepts
there
was
one
exception
he
allowed
not
more
than
four
wives
to
a
disciple
he
himself
at
one
time
had
eleven
while
lived
he
was
wedded
to
her
alone
the
the
koran
is
regarded
as
the
word
of
god
by
a
hundred
millions
of
disciples
it
is
very
unequal
in
style
in
parts
it
is
vigorous
and
here
and
there
imaginative
but
generally
its
tone
is
prosaic
its
narrative
portions
are
chiefly
about
scriptural
persons

the

became
acquainted
with
the

they
cultivated

the

were
students
of

and
carried
the
study
of

which
they
learned
from
the

very
far

they

their
distinction
in

the

nothing
they

to
assimilate
what
they
learned
they
were
apt
interpreters

critics

they
produced
no

many

of

of

of

three
frank
princes
the
and

the
were
the
main
instruments
in
bringing
in
this
new
epoch
in
european
history
they
followed
a
similar
course
as
regards
the
wars
which
they
undertook
and
their
general
policy
the
conqueror
of
the
saracens
at
rendered
great
services
to
the
church
but
he
provoked
the
lasting
displeasure
of
the
ecclesiastics
by
his
seizures
of
church
property
he
rewarded
his
soldiers
with
archbishoprics
however
was
earnestly
supported
by
the
clergy
he
had
the
confidence
and
favor
of
the
franks
and
in
with
the
concurrence
of
pope
deposed
and
assumed
the
title
of
king
the
long
hair
of
the
badge
of
the

was
shorn
and
he
was
placed
in

in
was
anointed
and
crowned
at
by
the
bishop
of
who
exerted
himself
to
restore
order
and
discipline
in
the
frank
church
which
had
fallen
into
disorder
in
the
times
of
charles
martel
pipin
in
the
controversy
with
the
greeks
about
the
use
of
images
had
alienated
the
popes
from
the
eastern
empire
the
encroachments
of
the
lombards
threatened
rome
itself
and
were
a
constant
menace
to
the
independence
of
its
bishops
pope
resorted
to
for
help
against
these
aggressive
neighbors
and
in
solemnly
repeated
in
the
cathedral
of
denis
the
ceremony
of
his
coronation
the
carlovingian
usurpation
was
thus
hallowed
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
the
alliance
between
the
papacy
and
the
franks
so
essential
to
both
was
cemented
pipin
crossed
the
alps
in
and
humbled
the
lombard
king
but
as
aistulf
still
kept
up
his
hostility
to
the
pope
pipin
once
more
led
his
forces
into
italy
and
compelled
him
to
become
tributary
to
the
frank
kingdom
and
to
cede
to
him
the
territory
which
he
had
won
from
the
greek
empire
the
exarchate
of
and
the
or
the
lands
and
cities
between
the
apennines
and
the
adriatic
from
to
this
territory
the
frank
king
formally
presented
to
peter
thus
there
was
founded
the
temporal
kingdom
of
the
popes
in
italy
was
called
of
rome
which
made
him
its
virtual
sovereign
although
the
office
and
title
implied
the
continued
supremacy
of
the
eastern
empire
he
united
under
him
all
the
conquests
which
had
been
made
by
and
his
successors
his
sway
extended
over
and
as
far
as
the
pyrenees
it
was
the
rule
of
the
north
over
the
more
south
which
had
no
liking
for
the
frank
sovereignty
charlemagne
the
saxons
and
died
in
by
the
death
of
his
younger
son
carloman
his
older
son

became
the
sole
king
of
the
franks
charlemagne
is
more
properly
designated
the
for
he
was
a
german
in
blood
and
speech
and
in
all
his
ways
he
stands
in
the
foremost
rank
of
conquerors
and
rulers
his
prodigious
energy
and
activity
as
a
warrior
may
be
judged
by
the
number
of
his
campaigns
in
which
he
was
uniformly
successful
the
eastern
frontier
of
his
dominions
was
threatened
by
the
the
the
the
the
he
made
eighteen
expeditions
against
the
saxons
three
against
the
danes
one
against
the
bavarians
four
against
the
slaves
four
against
the
avars
adding
to
these
his
campaigns
against
the
saracens
lombards
and
other
peoples
the
number
of
his
military
expeditions
is
not
less
than
in
all
but
two
of
his
marches
against
the
saxons
however
he
accomplished
his
purpose
without
a
battle
that
he
was
ambitious
of
conquest
and
of
fame
is
evident
that
he
had
the
rough
ways
of
his
german
ancestors
and
was
unsparing
in
war
is
equally
certain
yet
he
was
not
less
eminent
in
wisdom
than
in
vigor
and
his
reign
on
the
whole
was
righteous
as
well
as
glorious
the
two
most
formidable
enemies
of
charlemagne
were
the
and
the
the
saxon
war
was
checkered
by
grave
disasters
and
pursued
with
undismayed
and
unrelenting
determination
in
which
he
spared
neither
himself
nor
others
it
lasted
continuously
with
its
stubborn
and
resistance
its
cruel
devastations
its
winter
campaigns
its
merciless
acts
of
vengeance
as
the
effort
which
called
forth
all
charles
energy
for
years
the
saxons
were
heathen
the
conquest
of
them
was
the
more
difficult
because
it
involved
the
forced
introduction
of
christianity
in
the
room
of
their
old
religion
more
than
once
when
they
seemed
to
be
subdued
they
broke
out
in
passionate
and
united
revolt
their
fiercest
leader
in
insurrection
was
a
last
and
terrible
uprising
in
consequence
of
the
slaughter
of
hundred
saxons

revolt
of

one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
charlemagne
wars
was
that

for

audacious
invaders
charlemagne
in
some
of
the
most
memorable
incidents
in
charlemagne
career
are
connected
with
italy
while
he
was
busy
in
the
saxon
war
he
had
been
summoned
to
protect
pope
from
the
attack
of
the
lombards
to
please
his
mother
had
married
but
he
had
afterwards
divorced
the
daughter
of
the
lombard
king
she
was
the
first
in
the
series
of
charlemagne
wives
who
it
is
said
were
nine
in
number
by
the
divorce
he
incurred
the
resentment
of
desiderius
who
required
the
pope
to
anoint
the
sons
of
as
kings
of
the
franks
in
charlemagne
crossed
the
alps
by
the
mont
cenis
and
the
bernard
captured
and
shut
up
desiderius
in
a
frank
monastery
the
king
of
the
franks
became
king
of
the
and
lord
of
all
italy
except
the
and
the
southern
extremity
of
which
remained
subject
to
the
greeks
the
german
king
and
the
pope
were
now
in
point
of
fact
dominant
in
the
west
a
woman
who
had
put
out
the
eyes
of
her
son
that
she
herself
might
reign
sat
on
the
throne
at
constantinople
this
was
a
fair
pretext
for
throwing
off
the
byzantine
rule
which
afforded
no
protection
to
italians
once
more
visited
italy
to
restore
to
the
papal
chair
who
had
been
expelled
by
an
adverse
party
and
at
camp
at
had
implored
his
assistance
on
christmas
day
in
the
year
during
the
celebration
of
mass
in
the
old
basilica
of

to
and
placed
a
crown
on
his
head
saluting
him
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
people
as
roman
emperor
meaning
of
charles
the
coronation
of
charlemagne
made
him
the
successor
of
augustus
and
of
constantine
it
was
not
imagined
that
the
empire
had
ever
ceased
to
be
the
byzantine
emperors
had
been
acknowledged
in
form
as
the
rulers
of
the
west
not
even
now
was
it
conceived
that
the
empire
was
divided
in
the
imagination
and
feeling
of
men
the
creation
of
the
caesars
remained
an
indivisible
unity
the
new
emperor
in
the
west
could
therefore
only
be
regarded
as
a
rival
and
usurper
by
the
byzantine
rulers
but
charlemagne
professed
a
friendly
feeling
and
addressed
them
as
his
brothers
as
if
they
and
he
were
exercising
a
joint
sovereignty
in
point
of
fact
there
had
come
to
be
a
new
center
of
dominion
in
western
europe
the
diversity
in
beliefs
and
rites
between
roman
christianity
and
that
of
the
greeks
had
been
growing
the
popes
and
charlemagne
were
united
by
mutual
sympathy
and
common
interests
the
assumption
by
him
of
the
imperial
title
at
their
instance
and
by
the
call
of
the
roman
people
was
the
natural
issue
of
all
the
circumstances
charles
system
of
charlemagne
showed
himself
a
statesman
bent
on
organization
and
social
improvement
there
was
a
system
of
local
officers
the
border
districts
of
the
kingdom
were
made
into
under
or
for
defense
against
the
outlying
tribes
one
of
them
to
the
east
of
bavaria
was
afterwards
called
governed
provinces
some
of
which
afterwards
became
kingdoms
their
power
the
emperor
tried
to
reduce
the
empire
was
divided
into
districts
in
each
of
which
a
ruled
with
inferior
officers
either
territorial
or
in
cities
had
large
domains
and
great
privileges
and
immunities
the
officers
held
their
places
at
the
king
pleasure
they
became
possessed
of
landed
estates
and
the
tendency
was
for
the
offices
to
become
hereditary
the
old
german
word
is
of
uncertain
derivation
but
means
the
same
as
from
the
latin
is
a
word
found
in
all
the
teutonic
languages
from
the
signification
of
it
came
to
be
applied
like
its
synonym
to
a
frontier
district
a
was
a
or
an
officer
ruling
for
the
king
in
such
a
district
a
was
an
officer
subordinate
to
a
meaning
originally
from
the
latin
was
the
term
for
any
one
of
the
king
estates
the
was
first
his
representative
in
charge
of
one
of
these
domains
the
corresponded
to
the
in
english
and
french
it
signifies
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
king
the
groom
he
had
a
military
command
a
later
designation
of
the
same
office
is
from
two
old
german
words
one
of
which
means
a
as
seen
in
our
word
having
the
same
etymology
and
the
other
means
a
imperial
deputies
or
lay
and
ecclesiastical
together
visited
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
to
examine
and
report
as
to
their
condition
to
hold
courts
and
to
redress
wrongs
there
were
appeals
from
them
to
the
imperial
tribunal
over
which
the
presided
twice
in
the
year

were
held
of
the
chiefs
and

as
to
the
framing
of

the
enactments
of
these
assemblies

collected
in
the
of
the
frank
kings
in
the
church
charlemagne
tried
to
secure
order
which
had
sadly
fallen
away
and
had
given
place
to
confusion
and
worldliness
he
himself
exercised
high
ecclesiastical
prerogatives
especially
after
he
became
emperor
learning
and
one
of
the
chief
distinctions
of
charlemagne
is
the
encouragement
which
he
gave
to
learning
in
his
own
palace
at
he
collected
scholars
from
different
quarters
of
these
the
most
eminent
is
from
the
school
of
york
in
england
he
was
familiar
with
many
of
the
latin
writers
and
while
at
the
head
of
the
school
in
the
palace
and
later
when
abbot
of
martin
in
exerted
a
strong
influence
in
promoting
study
himself
spoke
latin
with
facility
but
not
until
late
in
life
did
he
try
to
learn
to
write
it
was
his
custom
to
be
read
to
while
he
sat
at
meals
augustine
of
was
one
of
the
books
of
which
he
was
fond
in
the
great
sees
and
monasteries
schools
were
founded
the
benefits
of
which
were
very
soon
felt
charles
personal
charlemagne
was
seven
feet
in
height
and
of
noble
presence
his
eyes
were
large
and
animated
and
his
voice
clear
but
not
so
strong
as
his
frame
would
have
led
one
to
expect
his
bearing
was
manly
and
dignified
he
was
exceedingly
fond
of
riding
hunting
and
of
swimming
his
friend
and
biographer
says
of
him
in
all
his
undertakings
and
enterprises
there
was
nothing
he
shrank
from
because
of
the
toil
and
nothing
that
he
feared
because
of
the
danger
he
died
at
the
age
of
seventy
on
he
had
built
at
la
a
stately
church
the
columns
and
marbles
of
which
were
brought
from
ravenna
and
rome
beneath
its
floor
under
the
dome
was
his
tomb
there
he
was
placed
in
a
sitting
posture
in
his
royal
robes
with
the
crown
on
his
head
and
his
horn
sword
and
book
of
the
gospels
on
his
knee
in
this
posture
his
majestic
figure
was
found
when
his
tomb
was
opened
by
near
the
end
of
the
tenth
century
the
marble
chair

the
dead
monarch
sat

it
a
favorite
theme
of
romance
among
the
poets
of

of
poetic
legends

about

of
the
charlemagne

all
gaul

had
numerous
other
allies
and
friends
even
the
famous
caliph
of
bagdad
held
him
in
high
honor
among
the
most
valued
presents
which
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
caliph
were
an
elephant
and
a
curious
which
was
so
made
that
at
the
end
of
the
hours
twelve
horsemen
came
out
of
twelve
windows
and
closed
up
twelve
other
windows
this
gift
filled
the
inmates
of
the
palace

with
wonder
condition
of
the
the
number
of
free
franks
diminished
under
charlemagne
they
were
thinned
out
in
the
wars
or
sunk
into
vassalage
the
warnings
and
rebukes
in
the
capitularies
or
body
of
laws
show
that
the
upper
clergy
were
often
sensual
and
greedy
of
gain
the
bishops

often
lead
in

their
contingent
of

were
twenty
thousand

times

their
lot
was
a
miserable
one
at
such
times
they
fled

it

to
the
growth
of
their

by
their

were
recognized
as

considered
to
be

appeared
what

afforded
a
sanction
to

these
are
universally
known
to
be
an
invention

in
that
uncritical
day
this
was
not
suspected
they
contained
not
much
in

of
hierarchical
claims

not
at

take
back
his

he
had
divorced

of

in

italy
in

by

her

or
the
scandals
belonging
to
this
dismal
period
in
the
history
of

are
to
be
ascribed
to
the

the

with

he
hid
himself
among

it

legend
that
he

in

and

adopted
the
practice
of

off

after

but
in
the
same
year
the
english
king
died
now
became
king
of
all
england
he
had
professed
christianity
and
unexpectedly
proved
himself
after
his
accession
to
be
a
good
ruler
one
of
the
legends
about
him
is
that
he
once
had
a
seat
placed
for
himself
by
the
seashore
and
ordered
the
rising
tide
not
to
dare
to
wet
his
feet
not
being
obeyed
by
the
dashing
waves
he
said
let
all

know
how
empty
and
worthless

the
power
of

there

none
worthy
of
the
name

he
whom
heaven
earth
and

obey

after
that
he
never

left
it
on

image
of
jesus
on
the
cross
inherited
the
crown
of
and
won
and
part
of
so
that
he
was
the
most
powerful
prince
of
his
time
his
sons
however
did
not
rule
well
and
in
the
english
chose
for
king
one
of
their
own
people
called
the
son
of
in
the
time
of
canute
the
power
of
the
danes
and
of
the
northmen
generally
was
at
its
height
denmark
norway
sweden
and
england
were
ruled
by
them
and
scandinavian
princes
by
descent
governed
in
normandy
and
in
russia
although
a
most
vigorous
race
the
northmen
showed
a
wonderful
facility
in
adopting
the
language
and
manners
of
the
people
among
whom
they
settled
the
effect
of
their
migrations
was
to
diminish
the
strength
and
importance
of
their
native
countries
which
they
had
left
other
settlements
of
the
northmen
made
many
other
voyages
which
have
not
yet
been
mentioned
as
early
as
there
was
a
scandinavian
king
in
they
early
conquered
the
the
and
the
on
the
northern
coast
of
scotland
they
founded
the
kingdom
of
which
they
held
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
was
discovered
by
the
northmen
and
was
settled
by
them
in
about
the
same
time
was
discovered
and
towards
the
end
of
the
tenth
century
a
colony
was
planted
there
this
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
mainland
of
america
and
to
the
occupation
for
a
time
of
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
coast
of
new
england
in
where
the
northmen
were
called
one
of
their
leaders
occupied
in
and
founded
a
line
of
sovereigns
which
continued
until
incursions
of
the
were
marauders
in
italy
as
the
northmen
were
in
france
from
in
tunis
as
we
have
seen
they
sent
out
their
piratical
fleets
which
ravaged
malta
sicily
and
other
islands
of
the
mediterranean
these
corsairs
checked
for
the
moment
by
the
fleets
of
charlemagne
afterwards
began
anew
their
conquests
from
sicily
of
which
they
made
themselves
masters
in
they
passed
over
to
the
italian
mainland
among
their
deeds
are
included
the
burning
of
and
the
wealthy
abbey
of
they
landed
on
the
shores
of
provence
established
a
military
colony
there
pillaged
and
and
continued
their
depredations
in
southern
france
and
switzerland
incursions
of
the
called
by
the
greeks
a
warlike
people
of
the
turanian
group
of
nations
crossed
the
carpathian
mountains
about
they
overran
the
whole
of
hungary
and
transylvania
in
in
the
course
of
their
predatory
invasions
they
penetrated
into
bavaria
and
the
king
of
germany
paid
them
tribute
they
carried
their
incursions
into
lombardy
and
into
southern
italy
they
even
crossed
the
rhine
and
devastated
alsace
lorraine
and
burgundy
such
terror
did
they
excite
that
their
name
remained
in
france
a
synonym
of
detestable
ferocity
character
of
the
later
the
incursions
in
the
ninth
century
differed
from
the
great
germanic
invasions
which
had
subverted
the
roman
empire
the
northmen
and
the
saracens
moved
in
small
bands
whose
main
object
was
plunder
and
not
either
permanent
conquest
or
as
was
the
aim
of
the
arabians
the
spread
of
a
religion
by
the
sword
the
alone
established
themselves
in
the
valley
of
the
theiss
and
the
danube
after
the
manner
of
the
franks
the
burgundians
and
the
goths
and
there
they
remained
the
great
effect
of
the
last
invasion
was
to
accelerate
the
breaking
up
of
political
unity
and
the
introduction
of
feudal
organization
or
the
preponderance
of
local
rule
as
opposed
to
centralized
power
the
northmen
in
england
and
italy
later
than
the
events
narrated
above
there
were
two
great
achievements
of
the
northmen
which
it
is
most
convenient
to
describe
here
although
they
occurred
in
the
eleventh
century
they
are
the
conquest
of
england
and
the
founding
of
the
kingdom
of
naples
and
sicily
i
the
norman
conquest
of
england
the
norman
the
duchy
of
normandy
had
become
very
strong
and
prosperous
and
under
the
northmen
or
normans
had
grown
to
be
one
of
the
principal
states
in
western
europe
king
of
england
surnamed
the
or
saint
had
been
brought
up
in
normandy
and
favored
his
own
norman
friends
by
lavish
gifts
of
honors
and
offices
the
party
opposed
to
the
foreigners
was
led
by
earl
of
the
west
saxons
after
being
once
banished
he
returned
in
arms
and
norman
knights
and
priests
were
glad
to
escape
from
the
country
wife
was
daughter
of
godwin
they
had
no
children
and
on
his
he
recommended
that
earl
the
son
of
godwin
should
be
his
successor
the
normans
claimed
that
he
had
promised
that
their
duke
should
reign
after
him
it
was
said
that
himself
on
a
visit
to
william
had
either
willingly
or
unwillingly
sworn
to
give
him
his
support
who
was
devout
in
his
ways
though
a
negligent
ruler
was
buried
in
the
monastery
called
westminster
which
he
had
built
and
which
was
the
precursor
of
the
magnificent
church
bearing
the
same
name
that
was
built
afterwards
by
king
was
now
crowned
duke
full
of
wrath
appealed
to
the
sword
and
under
the
influence
of
the
archdeacon
pope
took
his
side
and
sanctioned
his
enterprise
of
conquest
at
the
same
time
the
north
of
england
was
invaded
by
the
king
of
the
norwegians
a
man
of
gigantic
stature
named
the
norman
invaders
landed
without
resistance
on
the
shore
of
on
the
of
september
and
occupied
encamped
on
the
heights
of
on
the
of
october
the
great
battle
took
place
in
which
the
normans
were
completely
victorious
the
english
stood
on
a
hill
in
a
compact
mass
with
their
shields
in
front
and
a
palisade
before
them
they
repulsed
the
norman
charges
but
the
normans
pretended
to
retreat
this
moved
the
saxons
to
break
their
array
in
order
to
pursue
the
normans
then
turned
back
and
rushed
through
the
palisade
in
a
fierce
onset
an
arrow
pierced
the
eye
of
and
he
was
cut
to
pieces
by
four
french
knights
the
norman
duke
the
was
crowned
king
on
christmas
day
but
it
was
four
years
before
he
overcame
all
resistance
and
got
full
control
over
the
country
the
largest
estates
and
principal
offices
in
england
he
allotted
to
normans
and
other
foreigners
the
crown
of
was
handed
down
to
his
descendants
and
gradually
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
became
mingled
together
as
one
people
effect
of
the
norman
conquest
character
of
the
the
saxons
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
were
a
strong
and
hardy
race
hospitable
and
fond
of
good
cheer
which
was
apt
to
run
into
gluttony
and
revels
their
dwellings
were
poor
compared
with
those
of
the
better
class
of
normans
they
were
enthusiastic
in
sports
such
as
wrestling
and
hunting
they
fought
on
foot
armed
with
the
shield
and
axe
the
common
soldier
however
often
had
no
better
weapon
than
a
fork
or
a
sharpened
stick

a
test

fast
growing
to
be

eclipsing
the
old

capital
a
king
like
and
scholars
like
and
not
to
speak
of
old
chronicles
and
ballads
show
that
literature
was
valued
but
the
danish
invasions
in
where
schools
and
letters
had
flourished
did
much
to
blight
the
beginnings
of
literary
progress
the
norman
spirit
and
the
tapestry
at
represents
in
a
series
of
pictures
the
course
of
the
norman
conquest
there
we
see
the
costume
of
the
combatants
the
norman
gentlemen
were
mounted
and
fought
with
lance
and
sword
of
their
bravery
and
military
skill
their
success
affords
abundant
proof
although
the
normans
were
victors
and
masters
in
england
not
only
was
the
conquest
gradual
but
the
result
of
it
was
the
amalgamation
of
the
one
people
with
the
other
the
very
title
of
attached
to
william
was
a
legal
term
and
meant
or
there
was
an
observance
of
legal
forms
in
the
establishment
and
administration
of
his
government
the
or
the
public
land
was
appropriated
by
him
and
became
so
all
the
land
of
the
english
was
considered
to
be
forfeited
and
estates
were
given
out
liberally
to
norman
gentlemen
the
nobility
became
mainly
norman
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
ecclesiastics
and
other
great
officers
all
the
land
was
held
as
a
grant
from
the
king
in
the
making
of
was
decreed
which
was
a
complete
statistical
survey
of
all
the
estates
and
property
in
england
the
object
was
to
furnish
a
basis
for
taxation
the
is
one
of
the
most
curious
and
valuable
monuments
of
english
history
among
the
changes
in
law
made
by
william
was
the
introduction
of
the
norman
wager
of
battle
or
the
duel
by
the
side
of
the
saxon
methods
of
ordeal
described
above
in
most
of
the
changes
there
was

great
transformation
of

rules
and
customs
england
and
the
one
of
the
most
important
results
of
the
norman
conquest
was
the
bringing
of
england
into
much
more
intimate
relations
with
the
continent
the
horizon
of
english
thought
and
life
was
widened
one
incidental
consequence
was
the
closer
connection
of
the
english
church
with
the
papacy
foreign
ecclesiastics
some
of
them
men
of
eminence
and
of
learning
were
brought
in
it
was
this
connection
with
the
continent
that
led
england
to
take
so
important
a
part
in
the
crusades
then
norman
as
regards
feudalism
one
vital
feature
of
it
the
holding
of
land
by
a
military
tenure
or
on
condition
of
military
service
was
reduced
to
a
system
by
the
conquest
but
took
care
not
to
be
overshadowed
or
endangered
by
his
great
vassals
he
levied
taxes
on
all
and
maintained
the
place
of
lord
of
all
his
subjects
he
was
king
of
the
english
and
sovereign
lord
of
the
norman
nobles
he
summoned
to
the
or
great
assembly
those
whom
he
chose
to
call
this
summons
and
the
right
to
receive
it
became
the
foundation
of
the
out
of
the
old
saxon
there
grew
in
this
way
the
of
the
lower
orders
when
summoned
at
all
were
summoned
in
a
mass
afterwards
we
shall
find
that
they
were
called
by
representatives
and
in
the
end
when
the
privilege
of
appearing
in
this
way
was
converted
into
a
right
the
of
came
into
being
in
like
manner
the
gradually
came
to
be
in
the
room
of
the
assembly
itself
a
judicial
and
governing
committee
of
the
assembly
from
this
body
of
the
king
immediate
counselors
emerged
in
time
the
and
the
of
out
of
the
privy
council
grew
in
modern
times
the
composed
of
what
are
really
those
privy
councilors
who
are
specially
summoned
committees
of
the
national
assembly
in
the
course
of
english
history
acquired
separate
being
and
separate
powers
as
the
legislative
judicial
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
thus
the
english
constitution
is
the
product
of
a
steady
growth
mingling
of
blood
and
a
multitude
of
normans
emigrated
into
england
especially
to
the
normans
became
englishmen
as
a
natural
consequence
but
they
affected
the
spirit
and
manners
of
the
people
by
whom
they
were
absorbed
by
opening
avenues
for
french
influence
with
its
peculiar
ideas
and
ways
was
brought
into
england
but
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
were
kinsfolk
of
the
saxons
both
conquerors
and
conquered
were
teutons
the
conquest
was
very
different
in
this
particular
from
what
the
conquest
of
germany
by
france
or
of
france
by
germany
would
be
the
french
language
which
the
normans
spoke
had
been
acquired
by
them
in
their
adopted
home
across
the
channel
to
this
source
the
element
or
words
of
latin
etymology
in
our
english
tongue
is
mainly
due
the
loss
of
the
old
saxon
inflections
is
another
marked
change
but
this
is
not
due
to
so
large
an
extent
solely
to
the
influence
of
norman
speech
but
the
english
language
continued
to
be
essentially
teutonic
in
its
structure
for
a
long
time
the
two
tongues
lived
side
by
side
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
if
french
was
the
language
of
polite
intercourse
english
was
the
language
of
common
conversation
and
of
popular
writings
learned
men
spoke
or
could
speak
and
they
wrote
in
latin
norman
the
normans
built
the
cathedrals
and
castles
down
to
the
eleventh
century

architecture
derived
from
italy
had
been
the
one
prevalent
style
in
western
europe
in
the
modification
of
it
called
the

we
find
the
round
arch
associated
with
massive
piers
and
narrow

an
example
of
the
norman
romanesque
type
of
building
the
norman
conquerors
covered
england
with
of
which
the
white
tower
of
london
built
by
william
is
a
noted
specimen
sometimes
they
were
square
and
sometimes
polygonal
but
except
in
the
palaces
of
the
kings
they
afforded
little
room
for
artistic
beauty
of
form
or
decoration
they
were
erected
as
fortresses
and
were
regarded
by
the
people
with
execration
as
strongholds
of
oppression

back
to
the
romantic
period
of
norman
rule
norman
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
normans
although
so
distinguished
as
rovers
and
conquerors
have
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
they
were
lost
in
the
kingdoms
which
they
founded
they
adopted
the
languages
of
the
nations
which
they
subdued
but
while
in
england
they
were
merged
in
the
english
and
modified
the
national
character
this
effect
was
not
produced
in
italy
and
sicily
in
sicily
they
found
christians
and
mussulmans
and
italians
came
into
the
island
in
the
track
of
the
conquerors
the
normans
did
not
find
there
a
nation
as
in
england
and
they
created
not
a
nation
but
a
kingdom
of
a
composite
sort
beneficent
while
it
lasted
but
leaving
no
permanent
traces
behind
the
normans
in
sicily
says
freeman
so
far
as
they
did
not
die
out
were
merged
not
in
a
sicilian
nation
for
that
did
not
exist
but
in
the
common
mass
of
settlers

and
rite

distinguished
from
the
older
inhabitants
greek
and
saracen

of

imitative
power
which
imparted
a

they
adopted
from

they
lacked
originality
and
the
power
to
maintain
their
own
distinctive
type
of
character
and
of

freeman

eloquently
described
the

the
king
took
the

his

were
dwellings
connected
with
large
farms

and
he
went
with
his
courtiers
from
one
to
another
to
his
personal
followers
and
officers
he
allotted
lands
these
it
seems
were
granted
at
first
with
the
understanding
that
he
might
resume
them
at
will
as
holders
of
them
the
recipients
owed
to
him
personal
support
other
chiefs
and
of
a
minor
grade
took
the
same
course
this
was
the
germ
of
more
and
more
it
grew
to
be
the
characteristic
method
of
living
and
of
government
in
western
europe
after
the
fall
of
charlemagne
empire
the
inheritors
of
his
dominion
were
not
the
kings
of
france
of
germany
or
of
italy
but
the
numerous
feudal
lords
against
the
invasions
of
the
norman
saracen
and
hungarian
plunderers
the
kings
and
the
counts
proved
themselves
incapable
of
defending
territory
or
people
meantime
the
principle
of
heredity
the
principle
that
benefices
should
go
down
from
father
to
son
or
to
the
next
heir
had
gained
a
firm
footing
another
fact
was
that
the
royal
offices
became
hereditary
and
were
transmitted
to
the
heirs
of
allodial
property
thus
the
exercise
of
government
and
the
possession
of
land
were
linked
together
in
times
of
danger
small
proprietors
more
and
more
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
richer
and
stronger
that
is
property
became
this
custom
had
begun
long
before
in
the
decadence
of
the
roman
empire
when
not
only
poor
freemen
but
also
men
of
moderate
means
ruined
by
taxation
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
great
and
settled
on
their
lands
they
became
thus
in
the
later
times
of
disorder
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
farmhouses
in
the
country
gave
place
to
fortified
on
or
other
defensible
sites
about
which
clustered
in
villages
the
dependents
of
the
lord
who
tilled
his
land
fought
for
him
and
in
turn
were
protected
by
him
the
substance
of
feudality
recognizes
two
principles
the
land
and
the
sword
riches
and
force
two
principles
on
which
every
thing
depends
to
which
every
thing
is
related
and
which
are
united
and
identified
with
one
another
since
it
is
necessary
to
possess
land
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
use
the
sword
in
one
own
name
that
is
to
say
to
have
the
right
of
private
war
and
since
the
possession
of
land
imposes
the
duty
of
drawing
the
sword
for
the
suzerain
and
in
the
name
of
the
suzerain
of
whom
the
land
is
held
feudalism
is
a
social
system
in
which
there
is
a
kind
of
of
lands
in
the
hands
of
warriors
who
hold
of
one
another
in
a
gradation
there
is
a
chain
reaching
up
from
the
tower
of
the
simple
gentleman
to
the
royal
or
castle
in
this
social
organization
there
are
the
two
grand
classes
of
the
and
the
but
the
even
if
he
be
a
king
may
also
hold
fiefs
as
a
suzerain
and
the
and
the
or
were
bound
together
by
reciprocal
obligations
the
vassal
owed
military
service
on
the
demand
of
the
lord
such
aid
as
the
suzerain
called
for
in
the
administration
of
justice
within
his
jurisdiction
other
aids
such
as
when
he
was
a
prisoner
to
pay
the
ransom
for
his
release
and
pecuniary
contributions
when
he
armed
his
eldest
son
and
when
he
married
his
eldest
daughter
these
were
legal
or
required
aids
they
took
the
place
of
in
modern
states
there
were
other
things
that
the
vassal
was
expected
to
do
which
were
or
if
the
liege
died
without
heirs
or
forfeited
the
fief
by
a
violation
of
the
conditions
on
which
it
was
held
it
reverted
to
the
lord
the
liege
was
with
the
fief
he
knelt
before
the
suzerain
put
his
hands
within
the
hands
of
the
suzerain
and
took
an
oath
to
be
his
this
was
from
in
the
latin
and
in
french
signifying
the
suzerain
might
at
any
time
require
its
renewal
under
the
feudal
system
every
thing
was
turned
into
a
fief
the
right
to
hunt
in
a
forest
or
to
fish
in
a
river
or
to
have
an
escort
on
the
roads
might
be
granted
as
a
fief
on
the
condition
of
loyalty
and
of
the
just
described
private
the
vassal
had
the
right
to
be
tried
by
his
peers
that
is
by
vassals
on
the
same
level
as
himself
he
might
if
treated
with
injustice
go
to
the
superior
he
might
appeal
to
the
suzerain
of
his
immediate
lord
but
suzerains
preferred
to
take
justice
into
their
own
hands
hence
the
custom
of
prevailed
and
of
judicial
combats
or
so
common
in
the
middle
ages
entanglements
of
many
suzerains
were
mutually
vassals
each
holding
certain
lands
of
the
other
the
same
baron
often
held
lands
of
different
suzerains
who
might
be
at
war
with
each
other
so
that
each
required
his
service
the
sovereign
prince
might
be
bound
to
do
homage
to
a
petty
feudal
lord
on
account
of
lands
which
the
prince
had
inherited
or
otherwise
acquired
the
power
of
the
suzerain
depended
on
a
variety
of
circumstances
the
king
might
be
weak
since
feudalism
grew
out
of
the
overthrow
of
royal
power
the
king
of
with
the
exception
of
titular
prerogatives
and
some
rights
with
regard
to
churches
which
were
often
disputed
had
no
means
of
attack
or
defense
beyond
what
the
of
france
furnished
him
yet
logically
and
by
a
natural
tendency
the
king
was
the
supreme
suzerain

in
its
bosom

arms
by
which
it
was
one
day
to
be
struck
down

often
under

besides
their
tithes
the
clergy

often
availed
themselves
of
the
protection
of

they
were

the

increased

it
might
be
despoiled

it
could
defend
itself
by
the
terrible
weapon
of
excommunication

in
the
eleventh
century
europe
was
thus
covered
with
a
multitude
of
petty
sovereigns

the

the
mass
of
the
people
these
were
the
the

enjoyed
some
of

who
since
they

which
the
proprietor
allowed
them
to
till

they
were
subject
like
the
serfs
to
the
will
of
the
suzerain

the
constant
tendency
was
for
them
to
sink
into
the
inferior
condition

distinguished
from

passed
away

emancipating
spirit
fostered
by

contest
with
three
of

it
was
evident
that
he
meant
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
his
father
and
to
reduce
the
princes
to
submission
hostility
arose
especially
between
the
young
king
and
the
who
did
not
relish
the
transfer
of
the
imperial
office
to
the
line
the
passionate
and
wilful
disposition
of
and
his
sensual
propensities
were
his
worst
enemies
the
strongholds
which
he
erected
among
the
in
themselves
a
menace
were
made
haunts
of
his
boon
companions
and
comrades
in

the
extortion
and
depredations
to
which
the
saxons
were
a
prey
provoked
a
great
insurrection
which
at
first
prevailed
but
the
excesses
of
the
elated
insurgents
as
seen
for
example
in
the
plundering
and
burning
of
churches
caused
a
reaction
henry
suppressed
the
revolt
and
dealt
with
the
saxons
with
the
utmost
harshness
treating
their
dukedom
as
conquered
territory
the
saxon
chiefs
were
now
in
durance
his
enemies
on
every
side
had
willingly
yielded
or
were
prostrate
the
hour
seemed
to
have
come
for
henry
to
exercise
that
sovereignty
as
roman
emperor
over
church
and
state
which
his
father
had
wielded
but
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
new
and
powerful
antagonist
in
the
celebrated
pope
or
hildebrand
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
roman
church
had
called
into
existence
a
party
of
reform
the
life
and
soul
of
which
was
he
was
the
son
of
a
carpenter
of
a
small
town
in
tuscany
and
was
born
in
he
was
educated
in
a
monastery
in
rome
and
spent
some
time
in
france
in
the
great
monastery
of
he
became
the
influential
adviser
of
the
popes
who
immediately
preceded
him
the
great
aim
of
hildebrand
and
of
his
supporters
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
whom
was
the
zealous
bishop
of
ostia
was
to
abolish
and
the
of
by
was
meant
the
purchase
and
sale
of
benefices
which
had
come
to
prevail
in
the
different
countries
the
old
church
laws
requiring
had
been
disregarded
and
great
numbers
of
the
inferior
clergy
were
living
with
their
wives
in
hildebrand
view
there
could
be
no
purity
and
no
just
discipline
in
the
church
without
a
strict
enforcement
of
the
neglected
rule
the
priests
must
put
away
their
wives
connected
with
these
reforms
was
the
broader
design
of
wholly
emancipating
the
church
from
the
control
of
the
secular
power
and
of
subordinating
the
state
to
the
church
for
this
end
there
must
be
an
abolition
of
by
lay
hands
this
demand
it
was
that
kindled
a
prolonged
and
terrible
controversy
between
the
emperors
and
the
popes
the
great
ecclesiastics
had
temporal
estates
and
a
temporal
jurisdiction
which
placed
them
in
a
feudal
relation
and
made
them
powerful
subjects
it
was
the
custom
of
the
kings
to
invest
them
with
these
temporalities
by
giving
to
them
the
ring
and
the
staff
this
enabled
the
kings
to
keep
out
of
the
benefices
persons
not
acceptable
to
them
who
might
be
elected
by
the
clergy
on
the
other
hand
it
was
complained
that
this
custom
put
the
bishops
and
other
high
ecclesiastics
into
a
relation
of
dependence
on
the
lay
authority
and
moreover
that
the
and
being
badges
of
a
spiritual
function
it
was
sacrilegious
for
a
layman
to
bestow
them
contest
of
hildebrand
and
henry
in
the
period
of
lawlessness
at
rome
hildebrand
had
welcomed
the
intervention
of
and
even
of
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
but
this
he
regarded
as
only
a
provisional
remedy
made
necessary
by
a
desperate
disorder
on
acceding
to
the
papacy
he
began
to
put
in
force
his
leading
ideas
the
attempt
to
abolish
the
marriage
of
priests
was
resisted
and
stirred
up
great
commotion
in
all
the
countries
the
legates
of
the
pope
set
themselves
to
stem
the
tide
of
opposition
by
inveighing
in
addresses
to
the
common
people
against
the
married
clergy
as
unfit
to
minister
at
the
altar
by
this
means
a
popular
party
in
favor
of
the
reform
was
created
in
in
a
synod
at
hildebrand
pronounced
the
ban
against
five
councilors
of
for
simony
at
the
same
time
he
threatened
of
france
with
a
similar
penalty
he
forbade
princes
to
invest
with
any
spiritual
office
to
oaths
of
allegiance
he
did
not
object
but
to
any
investiture
of
a
spiritual
kind
gregory
selected
as
the
antagonist
with
whom
to
fight
out
the
battle
henry
ecclesiastical
appointments
were
not
simoniacal
in
fact
although
they
violated
the
papal
decrees
against
simony
his
real
offense
was
his
determination
to
make
the
appointments
himself
moreover
in
he
ventured
to
name
germans
to
the
sees
of
ferno
and
spoleto
unfortunately
he
was
weakened
by
the
disaffection
of
the
german
princes
and
most
of
all
of
the
the
fire
of
rebellion
in
saxony
had
not
been
quenched
it
was
still
smouldering
summoned
to
rome
to
answer
to
the
charges
made
against
him
in
three
german
synods
held
in
the
incensed
emperor
caused
empty
accusations
to
be
brought
against
the
pope
and
a
declaration
to
be
passed
deposing
him
he
sent
to
the
pontiff
a
letter
filled
with
denunciation
and
addressed
to
the
false
monk
hildebrand
gregory
issued
decrees
excommunicating
deposing
him
and
declaring
his
subjects
free
from
their
obligation
of
allegiance
it
was
the
received
doctrine
that
a
heretic
or
a
heathen
could
not
reign
over
christian
people
the
discontented
german
princes
took
sides
with
gregory
in
an
assembly
at
in
they
invited
the
pope
to
come
to
and
to
judge
in
the
case
of
he
was
to
live
as
a
private
man
and
if
he
remained
excommunicate
for
a
year
he
was
to
cease
to
be
king
altogether
humiliation
of
henry
was
now
as
anxious
for
reconciliation
with
the
pope
as
before
he
had
been
bold
in
his
defiance
in
the
midst
of
winter
with
his
wife
and
child
and
a
few
attendants
he
crossed
the
mt
cenis
pass
undergoing
extreme
difficulty
and
hardship
and
presented
himself
as
a
penitent
before
gregory
who
had
arrived
on
his
way
to
at
the
strongly
fortified
castle
of
the
pope
kept
him
waiting
long
it
is
said
barefoot
and
bareheaded
in
the
of
the
castle
finally
he
was
admitted
and
absolved
but
only
on
the
condition
that
was
to
adjust
the
matters
in
dispute
between
the
emperor
and
his
subjects
continued
when
henry
found
that
his
imperial
rights
were
still
withheld
his
fiery
spirit
rebounded
from
this
depth
of
humiliation
the
with
whom
gregory
was
unpopular
joined
him
a
majority
of
the
german
princes
adhering
to
the
pope
in
elected
duke
of
swabia
emperor
the
pope
took
up
his
cause
and
in
once
more
excommunicated
and
deposed
the
emperor
proclaimed
anew
through
synods
the
deposition
and
things
were
back
in
the
former
state
the

a
archbishop
of

increased
he
invaded
italy
and
laid
waste
the
territory
of
countess
of
a
fast
friend
of
gregory
in
he
captured
rome
the
pope
had
found
a
defender
in
the
norman
duke
of
lower
italy
whom
he
had
excommunicated
but
whom
in
he
forgave
and
took
into
his
service
released

had
been
besieged
in
the
castle
of

at
salerno
may
when
near
his
end
he
uttered
the
words
which
are
inscribed
on
his
tomb
i
have
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
therefore
do
i
die
in

of
the
rectitude
of
his
intentions
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
whatever
view
is
taken
of
the
expediency
of
his
measures
he
united
with
an
unbending
will
the
power
of
accommodating
himself
to
circumstances
as
is
witnessed
in
his
treatment
of
and
in
his
forbearance
towards
the
king
of
england
with
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
break
of
this
great
pontiff
sir
james
stephen
says
he
found
the
papacy
dependent
on
the
empire
he
sustained
it
by
alliances
almost
commensurate
with
the
italian
peninsula
he
found
the
papacy
electoral
by
the
roman
people
and
clergy
he
left
it
electoral
by
a
college
of
papal
nomination
he
found
the
emperor
the
virtual
patron
of
the
holy
see
he
wrested
that
power
from
his
hands
he
found
the
secular
clergy
the
allies
and
dependants
of
the
secular
power
he
converted
them
into
the
inalienable
auxiliaries
of
his
own
he
found
the
higher
ecclesiastics
in
servitude
to
the
temporal
sovereigns
he
delivered
them
from
that
yoke
to
subjugate
them
to
the
roman
tiara
he
found
the
patronage
of
the
church
the
mere
desecrated
spoil
and
merchandise
of
princes
he
reduced
it
within
the
dominion
of
the
supreme
pontiff
he
is
celebrated
as
the
reformer
of
the
impure
and
profane
abuses
of
his
age
he
is
more
justly
entitled
to
the
praise
of
having
left
the
impress
of
his
own
gigantic
character
on
the
history
of
all
the
ages

mother
of
constantine
had
erected
a
stately
church
pilgrimages
which
had
become
more
and
more
a
custom
since
the
fourth
century
naturally
tended
to
the
sacred
places
in
palestine
especially
was
this
the
case
in
the
eleventh
century
when
piety
had
been
quickened
by
the
movement
in
a
great
pilgrimage
in
which
seven
thousand
persons
priests
and
laity
of
all
nations
were
included
under
archbishop
of
made
its
way
through
hungary
to
syria
not
more
than
a
third
of
them
lived
to
return
the
reports
of
returning
pilgrims
were
listened
to
with
absorbing
interest
as
they
told
of
the
spots
to
which
the
imagination
of
the
people
was
constantly
directed
what
indignation
then
was
kindled
by
the
pathetic
narrative
of
the
insults
and
blows
which
they
had
endured
from
the
infidels
who
profaned
the
holy
places
with
their
hateful
domination
in
the
ninth
century
under
caliphs
of
the
temper
of
christians
had
been
well
treated
about
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
the
fatimite
caliphs
of
egypt
were
the
rulers
at
jerusalem
was
fierce
in
his
persecution
but
his
successors
were
more
tolerant
when
the
seljukian
turks
got
control
there
the
harassed
pilgrims
had
constant
occasion
to
complain
of
insult
and
inhumanity
the
call
of
the
the
greek
emperor
threatened
by
the
mussulmans
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
bosphorus
sent
his
call
for
succor
to
all
christian
courts
two
popes
and
had
in
vain
exhorted
the
princes
to
rise
in
their
might
to
do
away
with
the
wrong
and
the
shame
which
the
disciples
of
jesus
were
suffering
at
the
hands
of
his
enemies
motives
to
the
after
this
only
a
spark
was
needed
to
kindle
in
the
western
nations
a
flame
of
enthusiasm
the
summons
to
a
crusade
appealed
to
the
two
most
powerful
sentiments
then
prevalent
the
sentiment
of
and
that
of
the
response
made
by
faith
and
reverence
was
reinforced
by
that
thirst
for
a
martial
career
and
for
knightly
exploits
which
burned
as
a
passion
in
the
hearts
of
men
the
peoples
in
the
countries
formed
by
the
germanic
conquests
were
full
of
vigor
and
life
outside
of
the
church
there
was
no
employment
to
attract
aspiring
youth
but
the
employment
of
a
soldier
western
europe
was
covered
with
a
of
petty
sovereignties
feudal
conflicts
while
they
were
a
discipline
of
strength
and
valor
were
a
narrow
field
for
all
this
energy
there
was
a
latent
yearning
for
a
wider
horizon
a
broader
theater
of
action
thus
the
crusades
profoundly
interested
all
classes
the
church
and
the
clergy
the
lower
orders
the
women
and
the
children
shared
to
the
full
in
the
religious
enthusiasm
which
in
the
case
of
princes
and
nobles
took
the
form
of
an
intense
desire
to
engage
personally
in
the
holy
war
in
order
to
crush
the
infidels
and
at
the
same
time
to
signalize
themselves
by
gallant
feats
of
arms
there
was
no
surer
road
to
salvation
there
was
moreover
a
hope
of
which
all
in
distressed
circumstances
partook
of
improving
their
temporal
lot
the
council
of
the
prime
author
of
the
first
crusade
was
pope
he
authorized
an
enthusiast
the
of
amiens
to
travel
on
an
ass
through
italy
and
southern
france
and
to
stir
up
the
people
to
the
great
undertaking
of
delivering
the
holy
sepulcher
with
an
emaciated
countenance
and
flashing
eye
his
head
bare
and
feet
naked
and
wearing
a
coarse
garment
bound
with
a
girdle
of
cords
he
told
his
burning
tale
of
the
inflictions
endured
by
the
pilgrims
at
the
great
council
of
in
where
a
throng
of
bishops
and
nobles
and
a
multitude
of
common
people
who
spoke
the
romanic
tongue
were
assembled
himself
addressed
the
assembly
in
a
strain
of
impassioned
fervor
he
called
upon
everyone
to
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
that
he
might
win
christ
whoever
would
enlist
in
the
war
was
to
have
a
complete
remission
of
penances
a
plenary
indulgence
the
answer
was
thundered
forth
god
wills
it
thousands
knelt
and
begged
to
be
enrolled
in
the
sacred
bands
the
red
cross
of
cloth
or
silk
fastened
to
the
right
shoulder
was
the
badge
of
all
who
took
up
arms
hence
they
were
called
from
an
old
french
word
derived
from
lat
acc
of
a
cross
the
undisciplined
the
farmer
left
his
plow
and
the
shepherd
his
flock
both
sexes
and
all
ages
were
inspired
with
a
common
passion
before
a
military
organization
could
be
made
a
disorderly
host
poorly
armed
and
led
by
the
and
the
a
french
knight
started
for
constantinople
by
way
of
germany
and
hungary
they
were
obliged
to
separate
and
of
two
hundred
thousand
it
is
said
that
only
seven
thousand
reached
that
capital
these
perished
in
asia
minor
they
left
their
bones
on
the
plain
of
where
they
were
found
by
the
next
crusading
expedition
first
crusade
the
crusades
were
primarily
a
gaulish
movement
in
lands
the
fire
of
chivalric
devotion
was
most
intense
the
first
regular
army
of
soldiers
of
the
cross
departed
by
different
routes
under
separate
chiefs
first
of
these
was
of
duke
of
lower
lorraine
the
bravest
and
noblest
of
them
all
with
him
were
his
brothers
and
count
of
boulogne
prominent
among
the
other
chiefs
were

nephew
the
spaniards
were
taken
up
with
their
own
crusade
against
the
moors
in
consequence
of
the
late
absorbing
struggles
between
emperors
and
popes
the
germans
and
italians
did
not
now
embark
in
the
enterprise
the
relation
of
the
norman
dynasty
in
england
to
the
conquered
saxons
prevented
the
first
crusading
host
from
receiving
substantial
aid
from
that
country
the
leaders
of
the
army
finally
consented
to
become
the
feudal
dependents
of
the
emperor
while
they
should
be
within
his
borders
and
to
restore
to
him
such
of
their
conquests
as
had
been
lately
wrested
by
the
turks
from
the
eastern
empire
was
more
alarmed
than
gratified
on
seeing
the
swarm
of
warriors
which
he
had
brought
into
his
land
after
a
siege
of
seven
weeks
was
surrendered
not
however
into
the
hands
of
the
european
soldiers
who
had
conducted
the
siege
but
to
the
shrewd
at
in
a
desperate
battle
the
turks
were
defeated
but
on
their
march
eastward
they
wasted
the
lands
which
they
left
behind
them
the
crusaders
suffered
severely
from
disease
consequent
on
the
heat
a
private
quarrel
broke
out
between
and
invited
to
by
the
greek
or
armenian
ruler

for
several
months
by
the
treachery
of
a
renegade
christian
with
a
few
followers
was
admitted
into
the
city
the
christians
slew
ten
thousand
of
its
defenders
but
three
days
after
was
shut
in
by
a
great
army
of
turks
under
the
sultan
the
crusaders
were
stimulated
by
the
supposed
discovery
of
the
holy
lance
or
the
steel
head
of
the
spear
which
had
pierced
the
side
of
jesus
the
turks
were
vanquished
and
the
citadel
of
antioch
was
possessed
by
the
wrangling
chieftains
were
now
compelled
by
the
army
to
set
out
for
jerusalem
when
they
reached
the
heights
where
they
first
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
holy
city
the
crusaders
fell
on
their
knees
and
with
tears
of
joy
broke
out
in
hymns
of
praise
to
god
but
not
accustomed
to
siege
operations
and
destitute
of
the
machines
and
ladders
requisite
for
the
purpose
they
found
themselves
balked
in
the
first
attempts
to
capture
the
city
yet
after
thirty
days
their
needs
having
been
meantime
in
a
measure
supplied
was
taken
by
storm
july
the
infuriated
conquerors
gave
the
rein
to
their
vindictive
passions
ten
thousand
saracens
were
slaughtered
the
jews
were
burned
in
the
synagogues
to
which
they
had
fled
when
the
thirst
for
blood
and
for
plunder
was
sated
feelings
of
penitence
and
humility
took
possession
of
the
victors
the
leaders
casting
aside
their
arms
with
bared
heads
and
barefoot
entered
into
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulcher
and
on
their
bended
knees
thanked
god
for
their
success
after
debate
the
princes
united
in
choosing
of
as
ruler
of
the
city
he
would
not
wear
a
royal
crown
in
the
place
where
the
saviour
of
the
world
had
worn
on
his
bleeding
forehead
a
crown
of
thorns
he
designated
himself
protector
of
the
holy
sepulcher
shortly
after
at
he
won
a
great
victory
against
the
vastly
superior
forces
of
the
egyptian
sultan
godfrey
died
the
next
year
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
who
first
took
the
title
of
king
of
jerusalem
the
force
of
the
moslems
and
the
almost
incessant
strife
and
division
among
the
crusaders
themselves
made
the
kingdom
hard
to
defend
the
new
venice
genoa
and
pisa
had
the
most
to
do
with
the
defense
and
enlargement
of
the
new
kingdom
it
was
organized
according
to
the
method
of
feudalism
it
continued
until
the
capture
of
jerusalem
by
in
the
military
the
principal
supporters
of
the
new
kingdom
at
jerusalem
were
the
orders
of
knights
in
which
were
united
the
spirit
of
chivalry
and
the
spirit
of
monasticism
to
the
monastic
vows
of
chastity
poverty
and
obedience
they
added
a
fourth
vow
which
bound
them
to
fight
the
infidels
and
to
protect
the
pilgrims
these
military
orders
acquired
great
privileges
and
great
wealth
each
of
them
had
its
own
peculiar
apparel
stamped
with
a
cross
the
two
principal
orders
were
the
knights
of
john
or
the
and
the
the
hospitallers
grew
out
of
a
hospital
established
in
the
eleventh
century
near
the
holy
sepulcher
for
the
care
of
sick
or
wounded
pilgrims
the
order
when
fully
constituted
contained
three
classes
of
members
knights
who
were
all
of
noble
birth
priests
and
chaplains
and
serving
brothers
after
the
loss
of
the
holy
land
the
island
of

given
up
to
them
this
they
held
until
when
they
were
driven
out
by
the
turks
and
received
from
the
emperor
the
island
of
the
templars
gained
high
renown
for
their
valor
and
by
presents
and
legacies
acquired
immense
wealth
after
the
loss
of
their
possessions
in
palestine
most
of
their
members
took
up
their
abode
in
from
there
many
of
them
went
to
france
not
a
few
of
them
became
addicted
to
violent
and
profligate
ways
they
were
charged
whether
truly
or
falsely
with
unbelief
and
oriental
superstitions
caught
up
in
the
east
from
their
enemies
these
accusations
coupled
with
a
desire
to
get
their
property
led
to
their
suppression

of
the
fourteenth
century

and

came
to
an
end
effects
of
the
the
crusades
were
a
spontaneous
movement
of
christian
europe
it
was
a
great
tide
which
bore
away
all
classes
of
people
it
lends
to
the
middle
ages
an
ideal
and
heroic
character
an
overpowering
sentiment
submerging
calculation
and
swept
over
society
there
was
infinite
suffering
countless
lives
were
the
forfeit
the
results
however
were
beneficent
it
is
true
that
the
conquests
made
in
the
east
were
all
surrendered
the
holy
places
were
given
up
yet
the
had
received
a
check
which
was
a
protection
to
europe
during
the
period
when
its
monarchies
were
forming
and
were
gaining
the
force
to
encounter
them
anew
and
repel
their
dangerous
aggressions
the
feudal
system
in
europe
was
smitten
with
a
mortal
blow
smaller
fiefs
either
by
sale
or
by
the
death
of
the
holders
were
swallowed
up
in
the
larger
the
anarchical
spirit
was
counteracted
was
promoted
there
was
a
lessening
of
the
social
distance
between
and
they
fought
side
by
side
and
aided
one
another
in
common
perils
the
consequence
was
an
increase
of
sympathy
there
was
expansion
of
there
was
a
widening
of
geographical
knowledge
an
acquaintance
was
gained
with
other
peoples
and
countries
to
the
more
civilized
saracens
the
crusaders
seemed
brutal
and
barbarous
the
crusaders
in
turn
were
impressed
with
the
superior
advancement
and
elegance
of
the
saracens
it
was
not
the
lord
only
who
beheld
distant
lands
the
serf
was
taken
from
the
soil
to
which
he
had
been
tied
he
drew
stimulus
and
information
from
sojourning
under
other
skies
a
great
impulse
was
given
to
trade
and
commerce
an
acquaintance
was
gained
with
new
products
natural
and
artificial
new
wants
were
created
the
cities
advanced
in
strength
and
wealth
important
social
consequences
resulted
from
their
growth
why
the
crusades
after
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
impossible
to
rekindle
the
crusading
enthusiasm
the
fire
had
burned
out
it
seemed
as
if
the
idea
had
exhausted
itself
in
action
this
effect
was
due
to
the
absence
of
novelty
in
such
undertakings
to
the
long
experience
of
the
hardships
belonging
to
them
which
tended
to
dampen
the
romantic
zeal
that
had
formed
a
part
of
the
motive
to
the
disappointments
following
upon
the
practical
failure
of
so
prodigious
and
costly
exertions
to
an
altered
condition
of
public
feeling
of
a
more
general
character
antipathy
to
the
infidel
the
more
exclusive
sway
of
religious
sentiment
were
giving
way
to
a
mingling
of
secular
aims
and
interests
there
were
new
and
wider
fields
of
activity
at
home
the
mood
of
men
minds
was
no
longer
the
same
luxuries
introduced
by
the
the
effect
of
the
crusades
in
bringing
in
new
comforts
and
luxuries
and
in
thus
altering
the
style
of
living
was
remarkable
at
the
very
outset
a
great
deal
of
money
obtained
by
the
sale
or
pawning
of
estates
was
spent
in
the
outfit
of
the
hundred
thousand
nobles
who
at
the
beginning
took
the
cross
costly
furs
embroidered
cushions
curtains
of
purple
dye
pavilions
worked
with
gold
banners
of
purple
or
of
showy
costumes
and
shining
armor
such
was
the
splendor
that
met
the
eyes
of
thousands
who
had
never
before
beheld
such
a
spectacle
the
journey
to
the
east
brought
under
the
observation
of
the
crusaders
arts
and
fashions
to
which
they
had
been
strangers
they
saw
the
gilded
domes
and
marble
palaces
of
and
the
treasures
of
ancient
art
which
had
been
gathered
within
the
walls
of
that
ancient
capital
with
all
its
wealth
fell
into
their
hands
later
the
merchants
of
both
religions
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
armies
and
met
one
another
the
superb
fabrics
of
the
east
were
carried
to
the
west
by
routes
which
now
became
safe
and
familiar
the
precious
ores
and
tissues
of
and
the
beautiful
glassware
of
were
conveyed
to
and
thence
to
places
more
distant
silk
stuffs
of
exquisite
beauty
were
brought
from
and
the
elegance
of
the
east
with
its
rich
fabrics
its
jewels
and
pearls
was
so
enchanting
that
an
enthusiastic
crusader
termed
it
the
vestibule
of
paradise
it
was
not
the
nobles
alone
in
the
west
who
acquired
these
attractive
products
of
skill
and
industry
the
cities
shared
in
them
even
the
lower
classes
partook
of
the
change
in
the
way
of
living
life
in
the
even
in
the
earlier
days
of
feudalism
the
seclusion
of
the
castle
was
not
without
an
influence
in
promoting
domestic
intercourse
and
affection
a
new
sentiment
respecting
woman
sprang
up
in
the
middle
ages
and
was
fostered
by
the
honor
which
the
new
testament
and
the
teaching
of
the
church
rendered
to
saintly
women
a
spirit
of
gallantry
and
devotion
to
woman
partly
natural
to
the
germanic
race
and
partly
arising
from
causes
like
that
just
named
sprang
up
in
the
midst
of
prevailing
ignorance
and
perpetual
strife
in
the
course
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
life
in
the
castle
is
found
to
be
very
much
improved
in
the
eleventh
century
it
lacked
comfort
to
say
nothing
of
luxury
the
lights
were
torches
of
dry
wood
even
candles
were
not
in
general
use
houses
in
france
england
and
germany
commonly
had
thatched
roofs
they
were
made
of
logs
covered
with
a
sort
of
clay
or
mud
they
were
built
with
low
and
narrow
doors
and
with
small
windows
which
admitted
but
little
light
in
the
middle
of
the
smoky
hall
was
a
large
round
fireplace
there
was
no
chimney
but
only
a
funnel
which
pierced
the
ceiling
the
seats
were
benches
and
stools
the
feet
of
the
family
and
guests
were
kept
warm
by
hay
spread
beneath
them
in
the
later
period
the
substitution
of
dry
rushes
and
straw
was
thought
to
be
a
marvelous
gain
beds
of
straw
were
introduced
into
all
the
apartments
of
nobles
and
even
of
kings
to
sleep
on
a
straw
couch
was
deemed
a
regal
luxury
one
consequence
of
the
crusades
was
to
introduce
carpets
and
hangings
into
the
dwellings
of
the
great
improved
timepieces
took
the
place
of
the
which
were
a
wonder
in
the
days
of
charlemagne
in
the
twelfth
century
the
castle
begins
to
look
less
like
a
dungeon
within
and
without
it
ceases
to
wear
so
exclusively
the
aspect
of
a
fortress
the
furniture
has
more
beauty
in
the
great
hall
are
the
large
tables
attached
to
the
floor
the
sideboards
the
cupboards
the
stately
chair
of
the
lord
the
couch
with
its
canopy
the
chests
for

in
the
thirteenth
century
france
was
covered
with
chateaux
which
in
the
case
of
princes
and
nobles
of
highest
rank
had
their
spacious
courts
their
stables
their
lodgings
for
the
servants
all
these
were
within
the
precincts
of
the
palace
in
the
great
hall
were
held
the
assemblies
of
vassals
banquets
judicial
trials
in
the
wealthiest
mansions
there
was
a
main
saloon
on
the
floor
above
reached
by
a
spiral
stairway
and
serving
also
for
the
principal
there
the
stone
floor
gave
place
to
marble
of
varied
colors
mosaics
and
other
ornaments
were
introduced
sculptures
carvings
and
mural
paintings
decorated
the
apartments
glass
mirrors
imported
by
way
of
venice
began
to
supersede
the
mirrors
of
polished
metal
larger
windows
of
painted

became
common
among
the

candles
came
into
vogue
lamps
were
not
unknown
on
great
occasions
lanterns
and
wax
candles
were
used
for
a
festive
illumination
chimneys
were
in
use
and
about
the
vast
the
family

could
gather
the
hospitality
of
the

was
often
bountiful

the
inmates
for
the
feast
that
followed
minstrels
enlivened
the
social
gathering
troops
of
mountebanks
and
buffoons
furnished
amusement
and
were
sometimes
lavishly
rewarded
there
were
singers
and
buffoons
who
were
attached
permanently
to
the
household
there
were
others
who
traveled
from
place
to
place
and
were
even
organized
into
corporations
or
guilds
the
or
to
whom
a
large
license
was
allowed
was

were
little
used

by
the
accouterments
of
the
or
of
the

from

twelfth
century
onward
the
improvement
in
the
comforts
of
living
was
not
confined
to
the
nobles
and
to
rich
burghers
in
cities
it
was
shared
by
the
rural
classes
notwithstanding
the
miseries
such
as
insecurity
and
dangers
of
famine
that
belonged
to
their
condition
poverty
and
a
french
writer
on
the
history
of
luxury
speaking
of
france
in
this
period
says
in
the
cities
we
meet
at
once
luxury
certain
beginnings
of
prosperity
and
frightful
misery
exists
in
a
form
the
most
hideous
there
is
an
organization
of
it
with
grades
and
a
sort
of
hierarchy
in
the
face
of
sumptuous
costumes
of
chateaux
better
adorned
of
the
nascent
wealth
of
industry
france
included
more
than
two
thousand
and
knew
not
how
to
treat
maladies
born
of
the
most
imperfect
hygiene
and
the
most
sordid
filth
such
were
the
extremes
the
course
of
general
progress
went
forward
between
them
the
condition
of
the
poorest
class
in
england
was
no
better
the
absence
of
vegetable
food
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
the
personal
dirt
of
the
people
the
sleeping
at
night
in
the
clothes
worn
in
the
day
and
other
causes
made
frightfully
common
at
the
outskirts
of
every
town
in
england
there
were
crawling
about
emaciated
creatures
covered
with
loathsome
sores
living
heaven
knows
how
they
were
called
by
the
common
name
of
lepers
and
probably
the
leprosy
strictly
so
called
was
awfully
common
such
being
the
life
of
the
poor
in
villages
and
in
the
absence
of
drainage
and
other
modern
safeguards
of
health
in
large
towns
it
is
no
wonder
that
in
the
middle
ages
there
were
terrible
pestilences
and
that
the
average
length
of
life
was
much
less
than
at
present
origin
and
nature
of
it
was
in
the
period
of
the
crusades
that
the
mediaeval
institution
of
chivalry
was
ennobled
by
receiving
a
religious
consecration
chivalry
is
a
comprehensive
term
denoting
a
system
of
ideas
and
customs
that
prevailed
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
western
kingdoms
of
europe
there
was
gradually
formed
a
distinct
class
of
warriors
of
superior
rank
who
fought
on
horseback
and
were
recognized
as
by
a
ceremony
of
equipment
with
arms
among
the
customs
of
the
ancient
germans
which
are
noticed
by
tacitus
and
in
which
may
be
discovered
the
germs
of
chivalry
are
the
remarkable
deference
paid
to
women
attendance
of
the
aspiring
youth
on
a
military
superior
out
of
which
vassalship
arose
and
the
formal
receiving
of
arms
on
reaching
manhood
at
the
outset
knighthood
was
linked
to
feudal
service
the
knights
were
landholders
in
the
age
of
charlemagne
the
warriors
on
horseback
the
were
the
precursors
both
in
name
and
function
of
the
of
later
times
the
word
meaning
a
youth
or
servant
and
then
a
military
attendant
came
to
be
a
term
of
equivalent
meaning
the
necessary
connection
of
knighthood
with
the
possession
of
fiefs
was
broken
in
the
thirteenth
century
through
changes
in
the
circumstances
of
warfare
knighthood
became
independent
of
feudalism
it
was
a
personal
distinction
frequently
bestowed
as
a
reward
for
brave
deeds
and
often
conferred
with
elaborate
ceremonies
partly
of
a
religious
character
when
the
boy
of
gentle
birth
passed
from
under
the
care
of
females
he
first
served
as
a
or
valet
at
the
court
of
a
prince
or
the
castle
of
a
rich
noble
having
been
thus
trained
in
habits
of
courtesy
and
obedience
he
was
advanced
not
earlier
than
the
age
of
fourteen
to
the
rank
of
and
instructed
in
horsemanship
and
in
the
use
of
weapons
he
followed
his
master
to
the
tournament
and
in
battle
until
finally
he
was
himself
dubbed
a
was
clothed
in
armor
of
steel
and
took
on
him
all
the
obligations
and
privileges
of
his
order
the
introduction
of
hereditary
surnames
and
of
armorial
bearings
served
to
distinguish
the
members
of
this
order
he
who
was
a
knight
in
one
place
was
a
knight
everywhere
there
were
different
classes
of
knights
the
bachelor
who
bore
a
forked
pennon
was
below
the
who
alone
had
the
right
to
carry
the
square
banner
the
banneret
was
required
to
have
a
certain
estate
and
to
be
able
to
bring
into
the
field
a
certain
number
of
lances
inferior
knights
with
their
and
each
knight
was
accompanied
by
his
squire
and
personal
attendants
not
seldom
two
knights
joined
together
in
a
brotherhood
in
arms
pledging
themselves
to
sustain
each
other
in
every
peril
the
virtues
of
there
were
characteristic
obligations
of
knighthood
one
was
which
included
a
strict
fidelity
to
all
pledges
embracing
promises
made
to
an
enemy
another
knightly
virtue
was
which
was
exercised
even
towards
a
foe
the
spirit
of
inspiring
devotion
to
woman
especially
the
chosen
object
of
love
and
protection
to
womanly
weakness
was
always
a
cardinal
trait
of
the
chivalric
temper
which
delighted
in
daring
exploits
and
sought
fields
for
the
exercise
of
personal
prowess
was
an
indispensable
quality
of
the
knights
the
ideal
of
chivalry
was
rather
than
benevolence
the
influence
of
chivalry
in
refining
manners
was
very
great
but
especially
in
its
period
of
decline
it
allowed
or
brought
in
much
cruelty
and
profligacy
its
distinctive
spirit
could
find
room
for
exercise
only
amid
conflict
and
bloodshed
which
it
naturally
tended
to
promote
ceremonies
of
when
the
knight
was
created
according
to
the
complete
form
he
entered
into
a
bath
on
the
evening
previous
was
instructed
by

of
chivalry

and
russet
like

hermit
passed
the
night
in
the
chapel
in
orisons
and
prayers
and
at
daybreak
confessed
to
the
priest
and
received
the
sacrament
he
then
returned
to
his
chamber
at
the
appointed
hour
he
was
conducted
to
the
hall
where
he
received
the
spurs
and
was
girded
with
the
sword
by
the
prince
or
other
lord
who
was
to
confer
the
distinction
by
whom
he
was
smitten
on
the
shoulder
and
charged
to
be
a
good
knight
thence
he
was
escorted
to
the
chapel
where
he
swore
on
the
altar
to
defend
the
church
and
his
sword
was
consecrated
judicial
the
disposition
to
resort
to
single
combats
as
a
judicial
test
of
guilt
or
innocence
was
stimulated
by
the
development
of
chivalry
there
were
other
ordeals
long
in
vogue
by
which
it
was
thought
that
heaven
would
interpose
miraculously
to
shield
and
thus
to
vindicate
the
innocent
and
to
expose
the
criminal
such
were
the
plunging
of
the
hand
into
boiling
water
the
contact
of
the
flesh
with
iron
or
with
fire
the
lot
the
oath
taken
on
holy
relics
the
reception
of
the
eucharist
which
would
choke
the
perjurer
and
send
his
soul
to
perdition
the
ordeals
were
regulated
and
managed
by
the
clergy
among
the
german
and
also
the
celtic
tribes
there
are
traces
of
the
duel
between
combatants
for
purposes
of
divination
or
of
determining
on
which
side
in
a
controversy
the
right
lay
the
judicial
combat
in
mediaeval
europe
became
general
champions
in
cases
where
the
rights
of
women
were
in
debate
and
in
other
instances
where
the
wager
of
battle
between
the
direct
antagonists
in
a
dispute
was
impracticable
were
selected
or
volunteered
to
try
the
issue
in
an
armed
conflict
sometimes
professional
champions
hired
for
the
occasion
were
employed
the
custom
of
judicial
combats
by
degrees
declined
the
municipalities
and
the
spirit
of
commerce
were
averse
to
it
it
was
opposed
by
the
emperor
frederic
ii
and
by
louis
ix
of
france
the
influence
of
the
roman
law
helped
to
undermine
it
but
the
opposition
of
the
church
was
the
most
effectual
agency
in
doing
away
with
it
the
modern
duel
which
survived
the
judicial
combat
is
a
relic
of
the
ancient
custom
of
avenging
private
injuries
and
of
proving
the
courage
of
the
combatants
between
whom
a
quarrel
had
arisen
in
the
opening
of
shakespeare
play
of
richard
in
the
quarrel
of
mowbray
and
bolingbroke
the
idea
of
the
judicial
combat
mingles

motives
and

characteristic

england
and
france
the
first
period
of
their
rivalship
the
emperors
the
heads
of
the
holy
roman
empire
were
the
chief
secular
rulers
in
the
middle
ages
and
were
in
theory
the
sovereigns
of
christendom
but
in
the
era
of
the
crusades
the
kingdoms
of
england
and
france
began
to
be
prominent
in
them
moreover
we
see
beginnings
of
an
order
of
things
not
embraced
in
the
mediaeval
system
in
france
steps
are
taken
towards
a
compact
monarchy
in
england
there
are
laid
the
foundations
of
free
representative
government
connection
of
england
and
for
a
long
time
the
fortunes
of
england
and
of
france
are
linked
together
the
kings
of
the
french
with
their
capital
at
had
been
often
obliged
to
contend
with
their
powerful
liegemen
the
dukes
of
normandy
at
when
the
norman
duke
became
king
of
england
he
had
an
independent
dominion
added
to
the
great
fief
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
it
sometimes
looked
as
if
england
and
france
would
be
united
under
one
sovereignty
so
close
did
their
relations
become
death
of
william
the
it
was
while
the
angry
with
the
king
of
the
french
was
burning
in
the
between
normandy
and
france
that
by
the
stumbling
of
his
horse
in
the
ashes
he
was
thrown
forward
upon
the
iron
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
received
the
hurt
which
ended
in
the
next
month
in
his
death
on
his
he
was
smitten
with
remorse
for
his
unjust
conquest
of
england
and
for
his
bloody
deeds
there
he
would
not
dare
to
appoint
a
successor
it
belonged
he
said
to
the
almighty
to
do
that
but
he
hoped
that
his
son
might
succeed
him
the
burial
service
at
in
the
church
which
he
had
built
was
interrupted
by
a
knight
who
raised
his
voice
to
protest
against
the
interment
for
the
reason
that
the
duke
had
wrongfully
seized
from
his
father
the
ground
on
which
the
church
stood
the
family
of
william
made
a
settlement
with
ascelin
on
the
spot
by
paying
a
sum
of
money
and
the
service
proceeded
the
whole
ground
was
afterwards
paid
for
william
had
left
money
for
the
rebuilding
of
the
churches
which
he
had
burned
at
he
gave
his
treasures
to
the
poor
and
to
the
churches
in
his
dominions
these
circumstances
illustrate
in
a
striking
way
how
in
the
middle
ages
ruthless
violence
was
mingled
with
power
of
conscience
and
a
sense
of
righteous
obligation
william
william
the
conqueror
was
succeeded
by
his
son
who
was
as
able
a
man
as
his
father
he
promised
to
be
liberal
and
to
lay
no
unjust
taxes
but
he
proved
to
be
especially
after
the
death
of
the
good
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
vicious
and
irreligious
king
the
norman
nobles
would
have
preferred
to
have
his
brother
who
was
duke
of
normandy
for
their
king
but
the
english
stood
by
william
he
left
bishoprics
and
abbacies
vacant
that
he
might
seize
the
revenues
one
of
his
good
deeds
was
the
appointment
of
the
holy
and
learned
to
succeed
but
he
quarreled
with
who
withdrew
from
the
kingdom
normandy
which
he
had
tried
to
wrest
from
his
elder
brother
was
mortgaged
to
him
by
the
latter
in
order
that
he
might
set
out
upon
the
first
crusade
that
duchy
came
thus
into
the
king
possession
william
while
hunting
in
the
new
forest
was
killed
if
not
accidentally
then
either
as
it
was
charged
by
one
of
the
party
or
by
some
one
who
had
been
robbed
of
his
home
when
the
new
forest
was
made
he
was
found
in
the
agonies
of

she

margaret
wife
of

was
of
the
stock
of

kings
thus
the
blood
of
alfred
as
well
as
of
william
the
conqueror
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
later
english
kings
in
the
absence
of
his
older
brother
who
was
in
jerusalem
he
took
the
crown
and
put
forth
a
of
promising
the
church
to
respect
its
rights
and
giving
privileges
to
his
vassals
which
they
in
turn
were
to
extend
to
their
own
vassals
robert

back
from

from

he
failed
in

seeing

where
the

been

off

they
put

about

twisted
them
till
they
went
to

they
put
men
into
prisons
where
adders
and
snakes
and

were
crawling

so
they
tormented

some
they
put
into

short

not

the

stephen

of

kings
of
england
they
had
saxon
blood
in
their
veins
but
were
neither
norman
nor
saxon
except
in
the
female
line
it
was
years
since
the
conquest
and
although
the
higher
classes
talked
french
almost
every
one
of
their
number
was
of
mixed
descent
the
line
between
saxon
and
norman
was
becoming
effaced
a
vassal
of
the
king
of
france
henry
held
so
many
fiefs
that
he
was
stronger
than
the
king
himself

all
the
other

taken
together
from

married
later
by
marrying
one
of
his
sons
to
the
heiress
of
that
district
the
nominal
fief
of
normandy
came
practically
under
his
dominion
he
was
a
man
who
reduced
the
barons
to
subjection
and
pulled
down
the
castles
which
had
been
built
without
the
king
leave
it
might
seem
probable
that
the
possessor
of
so
great
power
would
absorb
the
little
monarchy
of
france
but
this
was
prevented
by
discord
in
england
discord
in
the
royal
family
between
the
king
and
the
clergy
and
later
between
the
king
and
the
barons
on

the
king
of
england
required
a
great
and
united
force
to
break
the
feudal
bonds
which
grew
stronger
between
the
king
of
france
and
the
french
provinces
of
england
we
shall
soon
see
how
france
enlarged
her
territory
and
how
the
english
dominion
on
the
continent
was
greatly
reduced
reforms
of
in
order
to
control
the

he
arranged
with
them
to
pay
money
in
lieu
of
military
service
in
this
way
they
were
weakened
at
the
same
time
he
encouraged
the
small
landowners
to
exercise
themselves
in
arms
which
would
prepare
them
for
and
to
assist
the
king
moreover
he
sent
judges
through
the
land
to
hear
causes
they
were
to
ask
a
certain
number
of
men
in
the
county
as
to
the
merits
of
the
cases
coming
before
them
these
men
took
an
oath
to
tell
the
truth
they
gradually
adopted
the
custom
of
hearing
the
evidence
of
others
before
giving
to
the
judges
their
that
is
their
declaration
of
the
truth
from
out
of
this
custom
grew
the
jury
system
becket
constitutions
of
the
conqueror
had
granted
to
ecclesiastical
courts
the
privilege
of
trying
cases
in
which
the
clergy
were
concerned
on
this
privilege
the
clergy
had
been
disposed
to
insist
ever
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
under
stephen
the
energetic
restraint
exercised
upon
them
was
removed
in
the
early
years
of
the
reign
of
henry
there
were
great
disorders
among
the
norman
clergy
and
crimes
were
of
frequent
occurrence
these
were
often
punished
more
lightly
than
the
same
offenses
when
committed
by
a
layman
as
church
courts
could
not
inflict
capital
punishment
henry
undertook
to
bring
the
clergy
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ordinary
courts
in
this
attempt
he
was
resisted
by
√†
who
had
been
his
chancelor
and
whom
he
raised
to
the
archbishopric
of
canterbury
in
the
full
expectation
of
having
his
support
he
had
been
gay
and
extravagant
in
his
ways
and
zealous
in
behalf
of
whatever
the
king
wished
but
the
brilliant
chancelor
became
a
strict
and
austere
prelate
the
champion
of
the
clergy
with
a
will
as
inflexible
as
that
of
henry
the
only
bishop
that
voted
against
him
at
his
election
remarked
that
the
king
had
worked
a
miracle
in
having
that
day
turned
a
layman
into
an
archbishop
and
a
soldier
into
a
saint
in
this
controversy
the
clergy
had
reason
to
fear
that
henry
if
he
got
the
power
would
use
it
to
punish
and
plunder
the
innocent
at
a
great
council
of
prelates
and
barons
the
of
were
adopted
which
went
far
towards
the
subjecting
of
the
ecclesiastics
as
to
their
appointment
and
conduct
to
the
royal
will
with
the
other
prelates
swore
to
observe
these
statutes
but
he
repented
of
the
act
was
absolved
by
the
pope
from
his
oath
and
fled
to
france
later
a
reconciliation
took
place
between
him
and
the
king
becket
returned
to
england
but
with
a
temper
unaltered
a
hasty
expression
of
henry
uttered
in
wrath
and
indicating
a
desire
to
be
rid
of
him
was
taken
up
by
four
knights
who
attacked
the
archbishop
and
slew
him
near
the
great
altar
in
the
cathedral
at
canterbury
the
higher
nobles
welcomed
the
occasion
to
revolt
was
regarded
as
the
instigator
of
the
bloody
deed
and
was
moved
to
make
important
concessions
to
the
pope
his
life
was
darkened
by
quarrels
with
his
sons
in
the
kings
of
france
and
scotland
and
many
nobles
of
normandy
and
england
joined
hands
with
them
henry
afflicted
with
remorse
did
penance
allowing
himself
to
be
scourged
by
the
monks
at
the
tomb
of
becket
or
thomas
for
he
was
canonized
the
people
rallied
to
him
and
the
nobles
were
defeated
the
rebellion
came
to
an
end
the
king
of
scotland
became
more
completely
the
vassal
of
england
in
another
rebellion
the
king
sons
rebelled
against
him
in

over

by
all
the

of
the
south
a
synod
brought
the
irish
church
into
subjection
to
the

but
there
was
constant
warfare
and
the
north
and
east
of

were
not

the
whole

was
not
conquered
until

four
centuries
later
weakening
of

in
the
weakening
of

was
the
salvation
of
who
had
more
the
spirit
of
a
monk
than
of
an
active

at

a
new
epoch
is
seen
to

it

philip
was
only
fifteen
years
old
when
he
began
to

for
years
he
labored
with
shrewdness
and
perseverance
and
with
few
scruples
as
to
the
means
employed
to
build
up
the
kingly
authority
his
first
act
was
a
violent
attack
on
the
whom
he
despoiled
and
banished
this
was
counted
an
act
of
piety
he
acquired
and
refusing
to
render
homage
to
the
bishop
of
amiens
who
claimed
to
be
its

sold

and
exclaimed
that
he
would
sell
london
if
he
could

the
two

set
out
together
in

soon
quarreled

a
complaint
from
one
of
john

hugh
of
lusignan
whose
affianced
bride
john

philip

forfeited
it
was
in

there
were
thirteen

the

was
the
oldest
and
by
far
the
most
important
the

other
suzerains

justice
each
in
his
own
domain
the
parliament
of
paris
was
originally
a
portion
of
the
king
council
that
was
set
apart
to
hear
causes
among
the
fiefs
it
considered
all
appeals
and
judicial
questions
but
in
the
reign
of
commissioners
or
of
the
king
held
provincial
courts
of
appeal
in
his
name
the
great
suzerains
established
each
in
his
own
fief
like
tribunals
but
of
more
restricted
authority
louis
ix
made
it
optional
with
the

to
be
tried
by
his
immediate
suzerain
or
in
the

which
were
subordinate
to
his
council
as

of
the
royal
tribunals
increased
as
that
of
the
feudal
courts
grew
weaker
in
the
parliament
of
paris
a
corps
of
legists
who
understood
the
roman
law
were
admitted
with
the
lords
knights
and
prelates
more

these
counsellors
were
left
to
themselves
later
there
was
a
division

gave
a
more
complete
organization
to

he
provided
that
it
should
hold
two
annual
sittings

there
grew
up
a
judicial
aristocracy

no

the

unless

great

occurred
with

refused

sometimes
under

it
has
been
supposed
that
municipal
government
in
the
middle
ages
was
a
revival
of
old
roman
rights
and
customs
and
thus
an
heirloom
from
antiquity
the
cities
those
on
the
rhine
and
in
gaul
for
example
were
of
roman
origin
but
the
view
of
scholars
at
present
is
that
municipal
liberty
such
as
existed
in
the
middle
ages
was
a
native
product
of
the
germanic
peoples
the
cities
were
incorporated
into
the
feudal
system

were
subject
to
a
lay
lord

to
a

in
the

which
were
waged
by

were
sometimes
helped
by
the
suzerain
against

king
and
sometimes
by
the
king
against
the
nearer
suzerain
in
the
cities
were
apt
to
ally
themselves
with
the
nobility
against
the
king
in
and
the
reverse
was
the
fact
but
in
the
cities
which
came
into
an
immediate
relation
to
the
sovereign
were
less
closely
dependent
on
him
than
were
the
cities
in
france
on
the
french
king
two
classes
of

strongest
relish
for
pageantry
and
for
a
brilliant
ceremonial
in
social
life
and
in
worship
there
was
associated
a
yearning
for
an
ascetic
course
under
the
monastic
vows
as
existing
orders
grew
rich
and
gave
up
the
rigid
discipline
of
earlier
days
new
orders
were
formed
by
men
of
deeper
religious
earnestness
in
the
eleventh
century
there
arose
among
other
orders
the
and
in
the
twelfth
century
the

the
order

liberation
of

captives
taken
by
the

the
older
orders
especially
that
of
the

its
different
branches
became
very
wealthy
and
powerful
the
order
under
its
second
founder
who
died
in
spread
with
wonderful
rapidity
the
mendicant
in
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
papal
authority
was
at
its
height
the
mendicant
orders
arose
the
order

was
fully
established
in
and
the
order
of
in
they
combined
with
monastic
vows
the
utmost
activity
in
preaching
and
in
other
clerical
work
these
orders
attracted
young
men
of
talents
and
of
a
devout
spirit
in
large
numbers
the
mendicant
friars
were
frequently
in
conflict
with
the
secular
clergy
the
ordinary
priesthood
and
with
the
other
orders
but
they
gained
a
vast
influence
and
were
devotedly
loyal
to
the
popes
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
monastic
orders
generally
were
made
up
of
the
weak
or
the
disappointed
who
sought
in
cloisters
a
quiet
asylum
disgust
with
the
world
from
whatever
cause
led
many
to
become
members
of
them
but
they
were
largely
composed
of
vigorous
minds
which
of
their
own
free
choice
took
on
them
the
monastic
vows
the
rise
of
the
the
crusades
were
accompanied
by
a
signal
revival
of
intellectual
activity
one
of
the
most
important
events
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
the
rise
of
the
universities
the
schools
connected
with
the
abbeys
and
the
cathedrals
in
france
began
to
improve
in
the
eleventh
century
partly
from
an
impulse
caught
by
individuals
from
the
arabic
schools
in
spain
after
the
scholastic
theology
was
introduced
teachers
in
this
branch
began
to
give
instruction
near
those
schools
in
paris
numerous
pupils
gathered
around
noted
lecturers
an
organization
followed
which
was
called
a
a
sort
of
made
up
of
four
faculties
theology
canon
law
medicine
and
the
arts
the
arts
included
the
three
studies
of
grammar
rhetoric
and
philosophy
with
four
additional
branches
the
arithmetic
geometry
music
astronomy
became
the
mother
of
many
other
universities
next
to
paris
was
famous
as
a
seat
of
education
of
all
the
universities
in
italy
was
most
renowned
as
a
school
for
the
study
of
the
civil
law
scholastic
the
scholastic
theology
dates
from
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
it
was
the
work
of
numerous
teachers
many
of
them
of
unsurpassed
acuteness
who
at
a
time
when
learning
and
scholarship
were
at
a
low
ebb
made
it
their
aim
to
systemize
elucidate
and
prove
on
philosophical
grounds
the
doctrines
of
the
church
was
the
author
whose
philosophical
writings
were
most
authoritative
with
the
schoolmen
in
theology
was
the
most
revered
master
the
main
question
in
philosophy
which
the
schoolmen
debated
was
that
of
and
the
question
was
whether
a
general
term
as
stands
for
a
real
being
designated
by
it
as
in
the
example
given
for
or
is
simply
the
of
divers
distinct
individuals
the
leading
in
the
eleventh
century
of
canterbury
was
a
noble
example
of
the
scholastic
spirit
in
the
thirteenth
century
was
a
bold
and
brilliant
teacher
but
with
less
depth
and
discretion
he
like
other
eminent
schoolmen
attracted
multitudes
of
pupils
the
thirteenth
century
was
the
golden
age
of
scholasticism
then
flourished
the
great
aquinas
and
others
very
influential
in
their
day
there
were
two
schools
of
opinion
that
of
the
the
adherents
of
the
great
theologian
of
the
order
and
that
of
the
the
adherents
of
a
great
light
of
the
they
differed
on
various
theological
points
not
involved
in
the
common
faith
the
discussions
of
the
schoolmen
were
often
carried
into
distinctions
bewildering
from
their
subtlety
there
were
individuals
who
were
more
disposed
to
the
method
of
investigation
and
who
gave
attention
to
as
well
as
metaphysical
science
perhaps
the
most
eminent
of
these
is
he
was
an
englishman
was
born
in
and
died
about
he
was
imprisoned
for
a
time
on
account
of
the
jealousy
with
which
studies
in
natural
science
and
new
discoveries
in
that
branch
were
regarded
by
reason
of
their
imagined
conflict
with
religion
was
cultivated
by
the
moors
in
spain
in
connection
with
astronomy
it
spread
among
the
christian
nations
the
search
for
the
transmutation
of
metals
had
its
curious
votaries
but
such
pursuits
were
popularly
identified
with
diabolic
agency
the
vernacular
literatures
the
intellectual
activity
was
for
a
long
time
exclusively
confined
to
theology
the
earliest
literature
of
a
secular
cast
in
france
belongs
to
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
and
to
the
dialect
of
the
study
of
this
language
and
the
poetry
composed
in
it
became
the
recreation
of
knights
and
noble
ladies
thousands
of
poets
who
were
called

almost
simultaneously

became
well
known

as

the
period
of
chivalry
began
the
theme
of
their
tender
and
passionate
poems
was
love
they
indulged
in
a
license
which
was
not
offensive
owing
to
the
laxity
of
manners
and
morals
in
southern
france

that
day
but
would
be
intolerable

a
different
state

figured
as
troubadours

thence
over

especially
the

condition
of

him
to

no

him

work

parts
it

an

purgatory

two
of
these
regions

when
he
was
a
boy
of
nine
years
of
age
he
had
met
at
a
festival
who
was
of

age
and
thenceforward
he
cherished
towards
her
a
pure
and
romantic
affection
before

after

death
his

so
called

the

would
modestly
place
it
below
the
rank
of
tragedy
besides
the
lofty
genius
which
it
exhibits
besides
the
matchless
force
and
beauty
of
its
diction
sums
up
so
to
speak
what
is
best
and
most
characteristic
in
the
whole
intellectual
and
religious
life
of
the
middle
ages
was

in
the
scholastic
system
taught
by
the
church

brought
to

in
his
pictures
of
the
supernatural
world
and
in
the
comments
connected
with
them
after
the
lombard
conquest
of
italy
art
branched
off
into
two
schools
the
one
was
the
byzantine
and
the
other
the
late
roman
in
the
byzantine
paintings
the
human
figures
are
stiff
and
conventional
forms
prevail
the
byzantine
school
conceived
of
as
without
beauty
of
person
literally
without
form
or
comeliness
the
romans
had
a
directly
opposite
conception
byzantine
taste
had
a
strong
influence
in
italy
especially
at
this
is
seen
in
the
mosaics
of
cathedral
the
first
painter
to
break
loose
from
byzantine
influence
and
to
introduce
a
more
free
style
which
flourished
under
the
patronage
of
the
church
was
who
is
generally
considered
the
founder
of
modern
italian
painting
the
first
steps
were
now
taken
towards
a
direct
observation
and
imitation
of
nature
the
artist
is
no
longer
a
slavish
copyist
of
others
says
already
belongs
to
the
new
order
of
things
for
he
invents
and
expresses
but
was
far
outdone
by
who
cast
off
wholly
the
byzantine
fetters
studied
nature
earnestly
and
abjured
that
which
is
false
and
artificial
notwithstanding
his
technical
defects
his
force
and
his
feeling
for
grace
of
action
and
harmony
of
color
were
such
as
to
make
him
even
more
than
the
founder
of
the
true
ideal
style
of
christian
art
and
the
restorer
of
portraiture
his
above
all
was
a
varied
fertile
facile
and
richly
creative
nature
the
contemporary
of
his
portrait
of
the
poet
has
been
discovered
in
recent
times
on
a
wall
in
the
podesta
at
florence
he
stands
at
the
head
of
the
school
of
allegorical
painting
as
the
latter
of
that
of
poetry
the
most
famous
pupil
of
was
about
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
era
of
the
revival
of
art
in
italy
a
new
school
of
sculpture
arose
under
the
auspices
especially
of
two
artists
of
and
his
son
they
brought
to
their
art
the
same
spirit
which
belonged
to
in
painting
and
to
in
poetry
the
same
courage
that
moved
the
great
poet
to
write
in
his
own
vernacular
tongue
instead
of
in
latin
emboldened
the
artists
to
look
away
from
the
received
standards
and
to
follow
nature
in
the
same
period
a
new
and
improved
style
of
sculpture
appears
in
other
countries
especially
in
the
gothic
cathedrals
of
germany
and
france
the
earliest
christian
churches
were
copies
of
the
roman
basilica
a
civil
building
oblong
in
shape
sometimes
with
and
sometimes
without
rows
of
columns
dividing
the
nave
from
the
aisles
at
one
end
there
was
usually
a
semicircular
most
of
the
churches
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
were
built
after
this
style
then
changes
were
introduced
which
in
some
measure
paved
the
way
for
the
the
peculiar
type
of
medi√¶val
architecture
the
essential
characteristic
of
this
style
is
the
pointed
arch
this
may
have
been
introduced
by
the
returning
crusaders
from
buildings
which
they
had
observed
in
the
east
its
use
and
development
in
the
churches
and
other
edifices
of
europe
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
were
without
previous
example
the
gothic
style
was
carried
to
its
perfection
in
france
and
spread
over
england
and
germany
the
cathedrals
erected
in
this
form
are
still
the
noblest
and
most
attractive
buildings
to
be
seen
in
the
old
european
towns

the

were
wholly
insufficient
for
the

methods

to
supply
himself
with
money
he
not
only
levied
onerous
taxes
on

subjects
and
practiced
ingenious
extortion
upon

he
resorted
again
and
again
to
the
device
of
debasing
the
coin
his
resolution
to
tax
the
property
of
the
church
brought
him
into
a
controversy
momentous
in
its
results
with
pope
idea
of
papal
prerogative
was
fully
as
exalted
as
that
formerly
held
by
and
but
he
had
less
prudence
and
and
the
temper
of
the
times
was
now
altered
if
philip
was
sustained
by
the
roman
law
and
its
interpreters
whose
counsels
he
gladly
followed
on
the
other
hand
could
lean
upon
the
system
of
ecclesiastical
or
canon
law
which
had
long
been
growing
up
in
europe
and
of
which
the
were
the
professional
expounders
the
vast
wealth
of
the
clergy
had
led
to
enactments
for
keeping
it
within
bounds
like
the
statute
of
in
england
forbidding
the
giving
of
land
to
religious
bodies
without
license
from
the
king
the
word
meant
and
was
applied
to
possessors
of
land
especially
ecclesiastical
corporations
that
could
not
alienate
it
the
jurisdiction
of
ecclesiastical
courts
which
kings
because
they
happened
to
have
a
less
liking
for
feudal
law
had
often
favored
had
now
come
to
be
another
great
matter
of
contention
in
in
the
bull
so
named
like
other
papal
edicts
from
the
opening
words
forbade
the
imposition
of
extraordinary
taxes
upon
the
clergy
without
the
consent
of
the
holy
see
responded
by
forbidding
foreigners
to
sojourn
in
france
which
was
equivalent
to
driving
out
of
the
country
the
roman
priests
and
those
who
brought
in
the
obnoxious
bull
at
the
same
time
he
forbade
money
to
be
carried
out
of
france
this
last
prohibition
cut
off
contributions
to
rome
the
king
asserted
the
importance
of
the
laity
in
the
church
as
well
as
of
the
clergy
and
the
right
of
the
king
of
france
to
take
charge
of
his
own
realm
there
was
a
seeming
reconciliation
for
a
time
through
concessions
on
the
side
of
the
pope
but
the
strife
broke
out
afresh
in
arrested
a
bold
legate
of
the
pope
poured
forth
a
stream
of
complaints
against
and
went
so
far
as
to
summon
the
french
clergy
to
a
council
at
for
the
settlement
of
all
disorders
in
france
the
king
then
appealed
to
the
french
nation
on
the
of
april
he
assembled
in
the
church
of
at
paris
a
body
which
for
the
first
time
contained
the
deputies
of
the
universities
and
of
the
towns
and
for
this
reason
is
considered
to
have
been
the
first
meeting
of
the
the
clergy
the
barons
the
burghers
sided
cordially
with
the
king
the
pope
then
published
the
famous
bull
in
which
the
subjection
of
the
temporal
power
to
the
spiritual
is
proclaimed
with
the
strongest
emphasis
boniface
then
excommunicated
philip
and
was
preparing
to
depose
him
and
to
hand
over
his
kingdom
to
the
emperor
death
of
boniface
meantime
had
assembled
anew
the
states

the
legists
lent
their
counsel
and
active
support
it
was
proposed
to
the
king
to
convoke
a
general
council
of
the
church
and
to
summon
the
pope
before
it
of
a
great
lawyer
in
the
service
of
philip
was
directed
to
lodge
with
boniface
this
appeal
to
a
council
and
to
publish
it
at
with
between
whose
family
and
the
pope
there
was
a
mortal
feud
attended
also
by
several
hundred
hired
soldiers

heaped
upon
him
the
severest
reproaches

is
said
to
have
struck

the

driven
out

condemnation

even
after

death

no
alternative
but
to
summon
a
council
which
was
held
at

was
declared
to
have
been
orthodox
at

suppression
of

one
of
the
demands
which
had
made
of
and
a
demand
which
the
council
had
to
grant
was
the
condemnation
of
the
order
of
knights
templars
whose
vast
wealth
philip
coveted
on
the
of
october
the
templars
were
arrested
overall
france
an
act
which
evinces
both
the
power
of
philip
and
his
injustice
they
were
charged
with
secret
immoralities
and
with
practices
involving
impiety
provincial
councils
were
called
together
to
decree
the
judgment
preordained
by
the
king
the
templars
were
examined
under
torture
and
many
of
them
were
burned
at
the
stake
a
large
number
of
those
who
were
put
to
death
revoked
the
confessions
which
had
been
extorted
from
them
by
bodily
suffering
individuals
may
have
been
guilty
of
some
of
the
charges
but
there
is
no
warrant
for
such
a

entire
order
the

he
continued
to

he
was
not
succeeded

by

this
precedent
was
soon
transformed
into
the
salic
law
that
only
heirs
in
the
male
line
could
succeed
to
the

the
rule
was
really
the

since

had

succeeded

the

thus
the
principle
of

of
heredity
in

there

so
it
fell
to
the

henry
had
to
confront
two
rebellions
one
was
that
of
the
under
which
he
long
tried
to
put
down
and
which
was
gradually
overcome
by
prince
of

the
story
of
whose

courses
in
his

was
perhaps
exaggerated
the
other
rebellion
was
that
of
the
powerful
northumberland
family
of
the
undertaken
in

of

he

of

they

years
and
put
to
death
as
a
traitor
and
heretic
whether
he
aimed
at
a
lollard
revolution
or
not
is
uncertain
the
lollards
were
persecuted
not
only
as
heretics
but
also
as
desiring
to
free
the
serfs
from
their
bondage
to
the

he
so
enlarged

terribly
afflicted
during

the
destructive
pestilence
that
swept
over

most
of

one
effect
was
an
outbreaking
of
religious
fervor
at

time
the
movement
of

its

elsewhere
they
scourged
and
lacerated
themselves
for
their
sins
marching
in
processions
and
inflicting
their
blows
to
the
sound
of

another
result
of
the
plague
was
a
savage
persecution
of

the
principal
end
for
which
the

was
called
was
the
healing
of
the
schism
in
the
church
in
consequence
of
which
there
were
three
rival
popes
and
the
securing
of

at
this

an

the
indignation
of

such
that
a

the

the

at

as
the
fury

the

more

more
under
the
rule
of
masters
called
tyrants
tyranny
as
of
old
was
a
term
for
absolute
authority
however
it
might
be
wielded
the
visits
of
the
emperors
and
of
bavaria
and
of
of
bohemia
son
of
henry
had
no
important
political
effect
except
to
bring
increased
power
to
the
ghibelline
despots
thus
after
the
interference
of
louis
iv
the
established
their
power
in
milan
but
the
changes
in
italy
after
this
epoch
gave
to
the
ghibellines
no
permanent
advantage
over
their
adversaries
the
leader
of
the
guelfs
for
a
long
time
was
king
of
naples
the
classes
of
the
methods
by
which
the
emperor
governed
in
italy
and
which
he
had
partly
learned
from
the
saracens
in
sicily
furnished
an
example
which
the
italian
despots
followed
later
he
was
imitated
in
his
system
of
taxation
in
his
creation
of
monopolies
in
the
luxury
and
magnificence
of
his
court
and
in
his
patronage
of
polite
culture
his
vicar
in
the
north
of
italy
da
who
was
captain
in
the
ghibelline
interest
in

other
cities
was
guilty
of
massacres
and
all
sorts
of
cruelties
the
story
of
which
exercised
a
horrible
fascination
over
others
who
came

was
down
by
venice

a
league
of
cities

ban
of

church
the
despots
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
have
been
divided
by
into
six
classes
the
class
had
a
certain
hereditary
right
from
the
previous
exercise
of
lordship
as
the
house
of
in
ferrara
the
class
as
the
family
in
milan
had
been
vicars
of
the
empire
the
class
were
captains
or
podestas
chosen
by
the
burghers
to
their
office
but
abusing
it
to
enslave
the
cities
most
of
the
tyrants
of
lombardy
got
their
power
in
this
way
the
class
is
made
up
of
the
like
at
milan
the
class
includes
the
nephews
or
sons
of
popes
and
is
of
later
origin
like
the
of
romagna
their
governments
had
less
stability
the
class
is
that
of
eminent
citizens
like
the
at
florence
and
the
of
bologna
these
acquired
undue
authority
by
wealth
sometimes
by
personal
qualities
and
noble
descent
among
those
who
are
called
despots
were
individuals
of
worth
moderation
and
culture
the
records
of
many
of
them
are
filled
with
tragic
scenes
of
violence
and
crime
to
maintain
their
hated
rule
they
were
impelled
to
the
practice
of
barbarities
hardly
ever
surpassed

symonds
in
vol
chap
ii
with
the
end
of
the
civil
wars
there
appear
the
companies
of
adventure
or
mercenary
troops
the
burghers
having
put
down
the
nobility
and
achieved
their
independence
lay
aside
their
arms
they
are
busy
in
manufactures
and
trade
the
despots
and
the
republics
prefer
to
hire
foreign
adventurers
the
free
companies
who
were
a
curse
to
italy
their
occupation
which
was
a
profitable
one
was
taken
up
by
natives
these
were
the
their
leaders
introduced
cavalry
and
more
skillful
methods
of
fighting
but
the
battles
were
bloodless
games
of
strategy
and
military
energy
declined
at
the
same
time
intrigue
and
were
the
instruments
of
political
aggrandizement
one
of
these
new
leaders
was
whose
son
became
duke
of
milan
five
states

in
the

of

ardor
which
was
fostered
by
the
popular
minstrelsy
and
by
the
romantic
exploits

encounters
with

the
result
was
the
peculiar
spirit
of
castilian
chivalry
the

the
feeling

no

lax

more
power

but
the
representation

was
exclusively
from

largely
from

the
the
extraordinary
authority

perhaps
the
most
remarkable
feature

ii
japan
changes
in
in
the
seventh
century
there
began
changes
in
japan
which
resulted
in
a
dual
government
and
eventually
in
a
feudal
system
which
continued
until
recent
times
the
retired
from
personal
contact
with
their
subjects
and
the
power
by
degrees
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
families
related
to
the
mikado
and
combined
into
clans
military
control
was
exercised
by
the

towards

of

devolved
on
the

clans

about

hard

family
the
by

absorbed
the
civil
offices
they
gradually
sank
into
luxury
from
the

to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
there
was
terrible
civil
war
between
the
clan
and
the
clan
in
which
the
former
were
destroyed
the
military
power
passed
from
one
family
to
another
but
a
main
fact
is
that
the
acquired
such
a
control
as
the
mayors
of
the
palace
had
possessed
among
the
franks
the
lost
all
real
power
and
the

a

restored
to

terminated
after

period

civil
war
in
the
war
of

called

emblem
the
chrysanthemum
was
between
two

mikados

in

the

in
the
south
there
ensued
a
period
of
confusion
and
internal
war
lasting
for
nearly
two
centuries
gradually
there
was
developed
a
system
of
feudalism
in
which
the
or
lords
of
larger
or
smaller
principalities
owned
a
dependence
either
close
or

modern
history
the
fall
of
constantinople
to
the
present
introduction
modern
history
as
a
whole
in
contrast
with
medi√¶val
is
marked
by
several
plainly
defined
characteristics
they
are
such
as
appear
however
in
a
less
developed
form
in
the
latter
part
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
recent
centuries
there
has
been
an
increased
tendency
to
consolidate
smaller
states
into
larger
kingdoms
there
has
been
a
secularizing
of
governments
have
more
and
more
cast
off
ecclesiastical
control
as
another
side
of
this
last
movement
in
europe
has
superseded
the
bond
of
union
among
nations
in
the
room
of
being
membership
in
one
great
ecclesiastical
commonwealth
became
political
it
came
to
be
membership
in
a
loosely
defined
confederacy
of
nations
held
together
by
treaties
or
by
a
tacit
agreement
in
certain
accepted
rules
of
public
law
and
outlines
of
policy
in
this
system
one
main
principle
is
the
of
this
means
that
any
one
state
may
be
prevented
from
enlarging
its
bounds
to
such
an
extent
as
to
endanger
its
neighbors
we
have
seen
the
action
of
such
a
principle
among
the
ancient
states
of
greece
even
in
the
middle
ages
as
regards
italy
the
popes
endeavored
to
keep
up
an
equilibrium
they
supported
the
in
southern
italy
or
the
in
the
north
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
german
emperors
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
were
formed
combinations
to
check
the
power
of
king
of
spain
and
emperor
of
germany
and
afterwards
to
restrain
his
successor
on
the
spanish
throne
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
were
like
combinations
against
of
france
and
over
a
century
later
against
the
first
the
vast
influence
and
control
of
by
discovery
colonization
and
commerce
in
other
quarters
of
the
globe
is
a
striking
feature
of
modern
times
with
the
increase
of
and
the
growing
power
of
the
classes
there
has
arisen
the
industrial
age
interests
connected
with
production
and
trade
and
with
the
material
side
of
civilization
have
come
into
great
prominence
both
the
pursuits
of
men
and
culture
have
become
far
more
than
was
the
case
in
the
middle

the
influence
of

sharp
contrast
with

chivalrous
princes

of

if
he
was
vindictive
he
was
perhaps
not
more
cruel
than
others

he
was
ungenial

as

he
took
pleasure
in

such
was
his
alarm
at

struggle
with

he
was

subdue
at

his
measures
for
this

were
imprudent
they

in
the
of

so
great
that
he
stood
in

peril

on

was
trying
to
reach
that
city
when
the
hostile
armies
encountered
one
another
at

it
was
an
absurd
battle
where
at
night
both
parties

themselves
beaten
the

secured
his
place
of
refuge

deemed
it
prudent
to

temper
courteous
and

fond

as
well
as
of
knightly
sports
and
with
his
head
full
of
dreams
of
ambition
with
certain
noble
qualities
his
pride
was
excessive
his
temper
not
only
hot
but
obstinate
and
as
he
grew
older
he
became
more
overbearing
and
cruel
he
was
the
most
powerful
prince
in
europe
the
most
of
his
lands
were
german
in
the
early
part
of
his
reign
he
pursued
the

as

which
was
at
the
root
of

aimed
to

to

counselors

soon
learned
that
his
was
of
little
value
at

found
himself
in
the

of
enemies
and
in
reality
a
prisoner
while
there
was
in
revolt
as
ascertained
at
the
king
instigation
the
wrathful
duke
could
be
appeased
only
by
agreeing
to
every
thing
that
he
required

to
undergo
the
humiliation
of
attending

his
army
and
of
basely
taking
part
in
the
vengeance
inflicted
on
the
city
which
he
had
himself
stirred
up
to
revolt
he
was
glad
to

repudiated

of

of
all
of
whom
he
had
nominated
and
summoned
a

organized
against

but
the

by
his
wariness

the
from
this
time
turned
his

devoted
himself
to
building
up
a
great
principality
on

that
of

no

barrier
in

the
spirit
of
the
inhabitants

himself
of

plausible
pretext

endeavored

to
make
a
truce
with

the
wily
who
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
any
mistakes
or
mishaps
of
his
impetuous
burgundian
adversary
the
cruelty

into

hands
of
the
hardy
mountaineers
who
knew
nothing
of
the
worth
of
these
things
the
next
year

once
more
flung
his
reckless
valor
against

from

defeat
at

risked
another
battle
near

force
composed
partly
of
treacherous
mercenaries
and

vanquished
and
slain

the

the
party

than

unsparing

most
striking
result
of

chapter

invention
and
discovery
the
renaissance
we
have
glanced
at
the
new
life
of
europe
in
its
manifestations
we
have
now
to
view
this
new
life
in
other
relations
we
have
to
inquire
how
it
acted
as
a
stimulus
to
effort
in
different
directions
the
term
is
frequently
applied
at
present
not
only
to
the
new
birth
of
art
and
letters
but
to
all
the
characteristics
taken
together
of
the
period
of
transition
from
the
middle
ages
to
modern
life
the
transformation
in
the
structure
and
policy
of
states
the
passion
for
discovery
the
dawn
of
a
more
scientific
method
of
observing
man
and
nature
the
movement
towards
more
freedom
of
intellect
and
of
conscience
are
part
and
parcel
of
one
comprehensive
change
a
change
which
even
now
has
not
reached
its
goal
it
was
not
so
much
the
arts
and
the
inventions
the
knowledge
and
the
books
which
suddenly
became
vital
at
the
time
of
the
renaissance
that
created
the
new
epoch
it
was
the
intellectual
energy
the
spontaneous
outburst
of
intelligence
which
enabled
mankind
at
that
moment
to
make
use
of
them
inventions
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
there
were
brought
into
practical
use
several
inventions
most
important
in
their
results
to
civilization
of
these
the
principal
were
the
and
by
movable
types
was
not
first
made
by
a
monk
of
as
has
often
been
asserted
we
have
notices
more
or
less
obscure
of
the
use
of
an
explosive
material
resembling
it
among
the
among
the
in
the
east
as
early
as
the
and
among
the
it
was
first
brought
into
use
in
firearms
in
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
effect
was
to
make
infantry
an
effective
force
and
to
equalize
combatants
since
a
peasant
could
handle
a
gun
as
well
as
a
knight
another
consequence
has
been
to
mitigate
the
brutalizing
influence
of
war
on
the
soldiery
by
making
it
less
a
encounter
an
encounter
with
swords
and
spears
attended
with
bloodshed
and
kindling
personal
animosity
and
by
rendering
it
possible
to
hold
in
custody
large
numbers
of
captives
whose
lives
therefore
can
be
spared
the
the
properties
of
the
magnetic
needle
were
not
first
applied
to
navigation
as
has
been
thought
by
but
long
before
his
time
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
the
compass
came
into
general
use
navigation
was
no
longer
confined
to
the
mediterranean
and
to
maritime
coasts
the
sailor
could
push
out
into
the
ocean
without
losing
himself
on
its
boundless
waste
printing
which
had
been
done
to
some
extent
by
wooden
blocks
was
probably
first
done
with
movable
types
about
by
who
was
born
at
but
who
lived
long
at
he
was
furnished
with
capital
by
an
associate
and
worked
in
company
with
a
skillful
copyist
of
manuscripts
brought
the
art
to
such
perfection
that
in
a
complete
latin
bible
was
printed
within
a
short
time
were
set
up
in
all
the
principal
cities
of
germany
and
italy
as
an
essential
concomitant
and
came
into
vogue
in
the
room
of
the
costly
parchment
books
were
no
longer
confined
to
the
rich
despite
the
censorship
of
the
press
thought
traveled
from
city
to
city
and
from
land
to
land
it
was
a
sign
of
a
new
era
that
in
germany
and
in
france
founded
a
postal
system
new
route
to
the
discovery
by
the
of
the
islands
of

of

of
the
was
followed
by
their
discovery
of
the

its
ivory
and
gums
the
pope
to
whom
was
accorded
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
heathen
and
of
newly
discovered
lands
granted
to
the
portuguese
the
possession
of
these
regions
and
of
whatever
discoveries
they
should
make
as
far
as
india

of

persistency

by

leaders
and
the
brave

established
on
the
coast
discovery
of
the
grand
achievement
in
maritime
exploration
in
this
age
was
the
discovery
of
by
a
native
of
the
conviction
that
india
could
be
reached
by
sailing
in
a
westerly
direction
took
possession
of
his
mind
having
sought
in
vain
for
the
patronage
of
of
portugal
and
having
sent
his
brother
to
apply
for
aid
from
of
england
he
was
at
length
furnished
with
three
ships
by
queen
of
castile

granada
had
just
submitted

to
have
the
station
of

viceroy

be
discovered
with
a
tenth
part
of
the
incomes
to
be
drawn
from
them
and
the
rank
of
a
nobleman
for
himself
and
his
posterity
the
story
of
an
open
mutiny
on
his
vessels
does
not
rest
on
sufficient
proof
that
there
were
alarm
and
discontent
among
the
sailors
may
well
be
believed
on
the
of
october
thought
that
he
discovered
a
light
in
the
distance

in
the
morning
of

neither

nor

which
were

soon
after
were

found
the
gold

which
the
navigators
and
their
patrons
at
home
so
eagerly
desired

a
fort
on
the
island

founded
a
colony
the
name
of

applied
to
the
new
lands
lived
and
died
in
the
belief
that
the
region
which
he
discovered
belonged
to
india
of
an
intermediate
continent
and
of
an
ocean
beyond
it
he
did
not
dream

all

of

to
bring
into
italy
learned
greeks
like
and
and
numerous
manuscripts
of
greek
authors
the
fall
of
increased
this
influx
of
greek
learning
the
new
studies
were
fostered
by
the
italian
princes
who
vied
with
one
another
in
their
zeal
for
collecting
the
precious
literary
treasures
of
antiquity
and
in
the
liberal
patronage
of
the
students
of
classical
literature
the
manuscripts
of
the
latin
writers
preserved
in
the
monasteries
of
the
west
were
likewise
eagerly
sought
for
the
most
eminent
of
the
patrons
of
learning
were
the
of
florence
founded
a
library
and
a
platonic
academy
all
the
writings
of

translated
by
one
of
that
philosopher
admiring
disciples
dictionaries
and
grammars
versions
and
commentaries
for
instruction
in
classical
learning
were
multiplied
these
with
the
ancient
poets
philosophers
and
orators
themselves
were
diffused
far
and
wide
by
means
of
the
new
art
of
printing
and
from
presses
of
which
the
that
of
at
was
the
most
famous
by
the
side
of
the
church
which
had
hitherto
held
the
countries
of
the
west
together
though
it
was
unable
to
do
so
much
longer
there
arose
a
new
spiritual
influence
which
spreading
itself
abroad
from

became
the
breath
of

for
all
the
more
instructed
minds
in

contest
of
the
new
and
the
old
in
germany
the
new
learning
gained
a
firm
foothold
but
there
as
elsewhere
the
as
its
devotees
were
called
had
a
battle
to
fight
with
the
votaries
of
the
medi√¶val
type
of
culture
who
largely
on
theological
grounds
objected
to
the
new
culture
and
were
stigmatized
as
obscurantists
in
italy
the
study
of
the
ancient
heathen
writers
had
engendered
or
at
least
been
accompanied
by
much
religious
skepticism
and
indifference
this
however
was
not
the
case
in
germany
but
the
champions
of
the
scholastic
method
and
system
in
which
logic
and
divinity
as
handled
by
the
schoolmen
were
the
principal
thing
were
strenuously
averse
to
the
linguistic
and
literary
studies
which
threatened
to
supplant
them
the
advocates
of
the
new
studies
derided
the
lack
of
learning
the
barbarous
style
and
distinctions
of
the
schoolmen
who
had
once
been
the
intellectual
masters
the
disciples
of
and
of
the
schoolmen
still
had
a
strong
hold
in
and
other
universities
but
certain
universities
like
and
let
in
the
humanistic
studies
in
the
elector
of
saxony
founded
a
university
at
in
which
from
the
outset
they
were
prominent
in
the
cause
of
learning
found
ardent
encouragement
and
had
able
representatives
in
such
men
as
dean
of
paul
who
founded
paul
school
at
his
own
expense
and
in
the
author
of
afterwards
lord
chancelor
under
reuchlin
ulrich
von
a
leader
of
humanism
in
germany
was
an
erudite
scholar
who
studied
greek
at
paris
and
basel
mingled
with
de
and
other
famous
scholars
at
and
wrote
a
hebrew
as
well
as
a
greek
grammar
this
distinguished
humanist
became
involved
in
a
controversy
with
the
of
who
wished
to
burn
all
the
hebrew
literature
except
the
old
testament
the
humanists
all
rallied
in
support
of
their
chief
to
whom
heresy
was
imputed
and
their
success
in
this
conflict
helped
forward
their
cause
von
one
of
the
young
knights
who
belonged
to
the
literary
school
and
others
of
the
same
class
made
effective
use
against
their
illiterate
antagonists
of
the
weapons
of
satire
and
ridicule
the
prince
of
the
humanists
was
no
literary
man
has
ever
enjoyed
a
wider
fame
during
his
own
lifetime
he
was
not
less
resplendent
for
his
wit
than
for
his
learning
latin
was
then
the
vehicle
of
intercourse
among
the
educated
in
that
tongue
the
books
of
were
written
and
they
were
eagerly
read
in
all
the
civilized
countries
he
studied
theology
in
lived
for
a
number
of
years
in
where
in
company
with
and
he
fostered
the
new
studies
and
finally
took
up
his
abode
at
in
early
youth
against
his
will
he
had
been
for
a
while
an
inmate
of
a
cloister
the
idleness
ignorance
and
artificial
austerities
which
frequently
belonged
to
the
degenerate
monasticism
of
the
day
furnished
him
with
engaging
themes
of
satire
but
in
his
of
and
in
his
the
two
most
diverting
of
his
productions
he
lashes
the
foibles
and
sins
of
many
other
classes
among
whom
kings
and
popes
are
not
spared
by
such
works
as
his
editions
of
the
church
fathers
and
his
edition
of
the
greek
testament
as
well
as
by
his
multifarious
correspondence
he
exerted
a
powerful
influence
in
behalf
of
culture
if
he
incurred
the
hostility
of
the
conservative
churchmen
he
still
adhered
to
the
roman
communion
and
won
unbounded
applause
from
the
advocates
of
liberal
studies
and
of
practical
religious
reforms
literature
in
the
first
effect
of
the
revival
of
letters
in
italy
was
to
check
original
production
in
literature
the
charm
of
the
ancient
authors
who
were
brought
out
of
their
tombs
the
studies
and
the
criticism
awakened
by
them
naturally
had
this
effect
for
a
time
italy
had
two
great
authors
in
the
vernacular
the
poet
and
it
had
besides
one
famous
historian
renaissance
of
this
period
was
not
simply
an
era
of
grand
exploration
and
discovery
and
of
the
new
birth
of
letters
it
was
the
brilliant
dawn
of
a
new
era
in
art
sculpture
and
painting
broke
loose
from
their
subordination
to
church
architecture
painting
especially
attained
to
a
far
richer
development
architecture
and
in
architecture
and
sculpture
the
influence
of
the
antique
styles
was
potent
under
the
auspices
of
the
and
other
edifices
of
a
like
kind
had
been
erected
at

died

in
particular
who
was
a

in
the
three
arts
of

a
student
of
his
works
is
one
of
the
men
of
genius
of
that
day
who
like
his
master
was
eminently
successful
in
different
branches
of
art
in
the
same
period
there
were
sculptors
of
high
talent
in
germany
especially
at
where
and
whose
skill
is
seen
in
the
bronze
tomb
of
in
the
church
of
that
saint
are
the
most
eminent
after
the
death
of
in
italy
there
was
a
decline
in
the
style
of
sculpture
which
became
less
noble
and
more
affected
painting
in
the
ancients
had
less
influence
on
the
schools
of
painting
than
on
sculpture
in
painting
as
we
have
seen
a
contemporary
of
the
poet
and
who
died
about
had
led
the
way
the
art
of
perspective
was
mastered
and
real
life
more
or
less
idealized
was
the
subject
of
delineation
in
italy
there
arose
various
distinct
styles
or
schools
the
school
reached
its
height
of
attainment
in
the
majestic
works
of
the
frescos
of
the
sistine
chapel
at
rome
the
school
is
best
seen
in
the
of
the
vatican
by
and
in
the
ideal
harmony
and
beauty
of
his
madonnas
prior
to
michael
angelo
and
raphael
there
was
the
symbolic
religious
art
of
the
painters
of
these
the
chief
was
the
devout
monk
who
transferred
to
the
canvas
the
tenderness
and
fervor
of
his
own
gentle
spirit
the
school
with
its
richness
of
color
has
left
splendid
examples
of
its
power
in
the
portraits
of
the
works
of
who
died
in
and
the
more
passionate
products
of
the
pencil
of
who
died
in
the
school
has
for
its
representatives
the
older
contemporary
of
da
who
combines
perfection
of
outward
form
with
deep
spirituality
and
by
whom
last
was
painted
on
the
wall
of
the
cloister
at
and
whose
play
of
tender
sensibility
and
skill
in
the
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
in
color
are
exhibited
in
or
of
the
at
and
in
his
frescos
at
the
school
of
founded
by
the
three
numbers
in
its
ranks
gifted
with
imagination
and
sensibility
and
who
depicted
the
more
wild
and
somber
aspects
of
nature
and
of
life
michael
angelo
and
the
two
foremost
names
in
the
history
of
italian
art
are
and
if
there
is
one
man
who
is
a
more
striking
representative
of
the
renaissance
than
any
of
his
contemporaries
it
is
michael
angelo
in
him
character
is
on
a
par
with
genius
his
life
of
almost
a
century
and
marvelously
active
is
spotless
as
an
artist
we
can
not
believe
that
he
can
be
surpassed
he
unites
in
his
wondrous
individuality
the
two
master
faculties
which
are
so
to
speak
the
poles
of
human
nature
whose
combination
in
the
same
individual
creates
the
sovereign
greatness
of
the
tuscan
school
invention
and
judgment
a
vast
and
fiery
imagination
directed
by
a
method
precise
firm
and
safe
raphael
lacks
the
grandeur
and
the
capacity
of
the
great
master
by
whom
he
was
much
influenced
raphael
had
a
nature
which
converted
every
thing
to
beauty
he
produced
in
a
short
life
an
astonishing
number
of
works
of
unequal
merit
but
to
all
of
them
he
imparted
a
peculiar
charm
derived
from
an
instinct
for
beauty
which
was
his
true
genius

the

introduction
the
general
stir
in
men
minds
as
indicated
in
the
revival
of
learning
and
in
remarkable
inventions
and
discoveries
was
equally
manifest
in
great
debates
and
changes
in
religion
one
important
element
and
fruit
of
the
is
here
seen
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
nations
of
western
europe
were
all
united
in
one
church
of
which
the
pope
was
the
acknowledged
head
there
were
differences
as
to
the
extent
of
his
proper
authority
sects
had
sprung
up
at
different
times
and
there
had
arisen
leaders
like
and
at
war
with
the
prevailing
system
ecclesiastical
sedition
however
had
been
mostly
quelled
yet
there
existed
a
great
amount
of
outspoken
and
latent
discontent
first
complaints
were
loud
against
maladministration
in
church
affairs
there
were
extortions
and
other
abuses
that
excited
disaffection
secondly
the
authority
exercised
by
the
pope
was
charged
with
being
inconsistent
with
the
rights
of
civil
rulers
and
of
national
churches
thirdly
disputes
sprang
up
both
in
regard
to
various
practices
deemed
objectionable
like
prayers
for
the
dead
and
the
invocation
of
saints
and
also
concerning
important
doctrines
like
the
doctrine
of
the
or
the
lord
supper
and
the
part
that
belongs
to
faith
in
the
christian
method
of
salvation
out
of
this
ferment
arose
what
is
called
the
protestant
reformation
the
nations
generally
broke
off
from
the
church
of
rome
and
renounced
their
allegiance
to
the
pope
the
or
for
the
most
part
still
adhered
to
him
as
the
common
idea
was
that
there
should
be
uniformity
of
belief
and
worship
in
a
state
civil
wars
arose
on
the
question
which
form
of
belief
should
dominate
was
desolated
for
thirty
years
by
a
terrible
struggle
yet
in
all
the
conflicts
between
kingdoms
and
states
in
this
period
it
was
plain
that
political
motives
or
the
desire
of
national
aggrandizement
were
commonly
strong
enough
to
override
religious
differences
when
there
was
some
great
interest
of
a
political
or
dynastic
sort
at
stake
those
that
differed
in
religion
most
widely
would
frequently
assist
one
another
it
is
in
this
period
that
we
see
under
and
reach
the
acme
of
its
power
and
then
sink
into
comparative
weakness
chapter
i
the
reformation
in
germany
to
the
treaty
of
nuremberg
beginning
of
the
the
reformation
began
in
where
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discontent
with
the
way
in
which
the
church
was
governed
and
managed
and
on
account
of
the
large
amounts
of
money
carried
out
of
the
country
on
various
grounds
for
ecclesiastical
uses
at
rome
the
leader
of
the
movement
was
the
son
of
a
poor
miner
and
was
born
at
in
he
was
an
augustinian
monk
and
had
been
made
professor
of
theology
and
preacher
at
by
the
elector
of
saxony
the
luther
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
intellectual
powers
and
a
hard
student
of
a
genial
and
joyous
nature
yet
not
without
a
deep
vein
of
reflection
tending
even
to
melancholy
he
had
a
strong
will
and
was
vigorous
and
vehement
in
controversy
he
had
been
afflicted
with
profound
religious
anxieties
but
in
the
study
of
paul
and
augustine
and
after
much
inward
wrestling
he
emerged
from
them
into
a
state
of
mental
peace
the
immediate
occasion
of
disturbance
the
spark
that
kindled
the
flame
was
the
sale
of
indulgences
in
by
a
dominican
monk
named
indulgences
were
the
remission
total
or
partial
of
and
in
theory
always
presupposed
repentance
but
as
the
business
was
managed
in
germany
at
that
time
it
amounted
in
the
popular
apprehension
to
a
sale
of
absolution
from
guilt
or
to
the
ransom
of
deceased
friends
from
purgatory
for
money
these
gross
abuses
were
painful
to
sincere
friends
of
religion
in
posted
on
the
door
of
the
church
at
his
celebrated
theses
it
was
customary
in
those
days
for
public
debates
to
take
place
in
universities
where
as
in
jousts
and

it
prudent
to
place
him
in

he
could
have
a
safe
and
quiet
asylum
there
he
began
his
translation
of

which
apart
from
its
religious
influence
from
the
vigor
and
racy
quality
of
its
style
made
an
epoch
in
the
literary
history
of
the
german
people
it
was
a
work
of
great
labor
the
language
used
by

in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
did
not
exist
before
in
so
pure
powerful
and
genuine
a
form
while
was
engaged
in
this
work
a
radical
movement
broke
out
at
of
which
one
of
his
supporters
was
the
principal
leader
he
was
for
carrying
changes
in
worship
to
such
an
extreme
and
for
introducing
them
so
abruptly
that
the
greatest
disorder
was
threatened
against
the
wish
of

left
his
retreat
and
by
his
discourses
and
personal
presence
quieted
the
disturbance
progress
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
carry
out
the

the
reason
was
that
the
influential
classes
were
so
much
in
sympathy
with

the
which
ruled
in
the

absence
would
do
nothing
against

its
committee
refused

a
list

grievances

the

nation
had
reason
to
complain

doings

as
their
leaders
had
applauded
him
a
reaction
against
innovations
including
changes
in
doctrine
was
the
natural
consequence
pope

earnestly
desirous
of
practical
reforms

his
successor

a
man
of

the
next
year
it
became
general

were
groaning
under
intolerable
burdens
of
taxation

other
forms

they
demanded
liberty

and
said

were
wronged
grievously

when
they
took
up

with
him
the
great
middle
class
which
he
led

sides
strongly
against

put
down

its
authors
inhumanly
punished

a
time

lacked
the
moral

necessary
to

in

difficult
a

after

was
detested
by

a
great
political
revolution
occurred
which
involved
also
a
religious
revolution
the
author
of
the
change
and
the
real
founder
of
the
swedish
monarchy
was
a
young
swede
of
noble
family
who
had
been
held
as
a
captive
in
but
had
escaped
and
returned
to
his
country
he
was
of
imposing
presence
prudent
yet
daring
and
with
a
natural
gift
of
eloquence
amid
great
dangers
and
sufferings
such
as
tradition
ascribed
to
king
of
england
he
succeeded
at
the
head
of
a
force
gathered
to
him
in
the
province
of
d√¢lecarlia
in
gaining
the
most
important
places
in
the
country
and
was
proclaimed
king
in
he
was
not
deeply
interested
in
the
religious
controversy
although
he
favored
lutheranism
but
he
made
it
his
steady
aim
to
break
down
the
clerical
aristocracy
to
weaken
the
nobles
and
to
organize
a
strong
and
prosperous
monarchy
he
proceeded
carefully
but
the
peasants
who
had
been
his
warmest
supporters
were
strongly
attached
to
the
old
church
and
the
opposition
to
his
measures
from
all
quarters
was
such
that
at
the
of
in
he
took
the
bold
step
of
offering
to
lay
down
the
crown
at
this
diet
he
had
assembled
representatives
of
the
citizens
and
peasants
as
well
as
the
clergy
and
nobles
he
proposed
to
pay
an
enormous
debt
which
was
due
to
by
using
the
colossal
wealth
of
the
church
for
this
purpose
and
to
shake
off
the
monopoly
of
trade
which
the
hanse
towns
enjoyed
finding
himself
withstood
he
renounced
the
throne
the
distraction
and
tumults
which
followed
his
act
of
relinquishing
the
crown
were
such
that
a
great
party
of
the
nobles
joined
him
three
days
after
his
abdication
he
was
recalled
to
the
throne
the
clergy
submitted
abjectly
and
the
church
was
no
longer
a
power
in
the
state
or
possessed
of
wealth
trade
was
released
from
its
bondage
to

the
other
towns
commerce
was
opened
with
foreign
countries
and
a
market
was
provided
for
the
main
product
of
the
country

nobles
were
held
in
subjection

very
rapid
progress

in

there
were
earnest
desires
for

reform
partly
aroused
by
such
humanists
as

even
sympathized
with
this
movement
and
intended
to
endow
colleges
and
bishoprics
out
of
the
confiscated
wealth
of
the
more
useless
monasteries
what
might
have
been
a
slow
development
of

thought
was
transformed
by
the
requirements
of
the

own
policy
of

the
advantages

there
were
the
protestants
by
conviction
who
were
for

this
had

in

places
in

prominent
leaders
of
this
party
against

catholic
theology
such
as

durham
and
other
bishops
at

the
king
inclined
towards
the
first
of
these
two
parties
one
of
his
most
important
acts
was
the
ordering
of
a

of
the
bible
into
english
a
copy
of

a

years
later
was
sent
to

scaffold
because
the

approved
of

seeing
how
unpopular
he
had
become

him
as
a
scapegoat

shielded
by
the

by

prudence

system
of

of
which
the

not
the

was

crimes

the
parties
in
germany
for
ten
years
after
the
peace
of
the
protestants
in
germany
were
left
unmolested
the
menacing
attitude
of
the
and
the
occupations
of
the
emperor
in
italy
and
in
other
lands
rendered
it
impossible
to
interfere
with
them
the
landgrave
of
hesse
a
chivalrous
protestant
prince
led
the
way
in
the
armed
restoration
of
duke
of
who
had
been
driven
out
of
his
dominion
thus
a
protestant
prince
was
established
in
the
heart
of
southern
germany
in
a
fanatical
branch
of
the
anabaptist
sect
at
with
whom
the
lutherans
did
not
sympathize
was
broken
up
by
the
neighboring
catholic
princes
the
overthrow
of
the
power
of
and
of
the
hanseatic
league
did
not
check
the
advance
of

directions

three
years
efforts
were
made
by
the
emperor
to
secure
peace
and
union
of
these
the
conference
and
diet
of
in
is
the
most
remarkable
the
protestants
and
catholics
could
not
agree
upon
statements
of
doctrine
but
the
necessity
of
getting
protestant
help
against
the
turks
compelled
to
sanction
the
peace
of
and
to
make
to
the
lutherans
other
important
concessions
this
arrangement
the
emperor
regarded
as
only
a
temporary
truce
among
the
conquests
of
protestantism
after
the
peace
of
and
prior
to
were
and
whose
rulers
adopted
the
new
doctrine
it
was
spreading

in
other
states
duke
of
fell
into
conflict
with
the
smalcaldic
league
and
was
conquered
so
that
his
principality
became
protestant
even
the
ecclesiastical
elector
of
was
taking
steps
towards
joining
the
protestant
side
this
would
have
given
to
the
lutherans
a
majority
in
the
electoral
college
the
bishoprics
with
temporal
power
were
numerous
in
germany
if
they
were
secularized
the
old
religious
system
would
be
deprived
of
a
principal
support
the
smalcaldic
was
now
secretly
resolved
to
coerce
the
protestants
in
germany
and
silently
made
his
preparations
for
war
before
hostilities
commenced
died
the
emperor
concluded
the
of

a
fourth
war
with
it
was
a
part
of
the
agreement
that
they
should
act
jointly

as
in
the
last
two
wars
against
the
emperor
had
taken
for

the

under
it
could
not
be
predicted
how
long
he
would
abide
by
his
engagements
for
the
present
was
safe
in
this
quarter
he
now
took
pains
to
shut
the
eyes
of
the
protestant
princes
to
their
danger
the
smalcaldic
league
was
of
its
strength
its
members
were
discordant
among
themselves
of
the
two
chief
leaders
the
elector
of
saxony
was
a
slow
and
unskillful
general
and
the
landgrave
of
hesse
a
brave
and
capable
soldier
could
not
take
command
over
an
elector
above
all
the
duke
of
saxony
was
in
the
midst
of
a
quarrel
with
his
relative
the
elector
and
coveted
a
part
of
his
territories
was
an
able
and
adroit
man
a
protestant
but
without
the
earnest
religious
convictions
that
belonged
to
the
electors
and
to
that
generation
of
princes
which
was
passing
away
was
won
by
the
emperor
through
promises
of
enrichment
and
favor
and
pledges
not
to
interfere
with
religion
in
his
principality
might
have
been
prevented
from
bringing
in
foreign
troops
from
the
netherlands
and
from
italy
but
the
military
conduct
of
the
elector
was
feeble
and
indecisive
he
was
defeated
and
captured
in
at
and
the
surrender
of
the
landgrave
soon
followed
the
protestant
cause
was
prostrate
the
clever
had
his
reward
the
electoral
office
was
transferred
to
him
he
obtained
a
goodly
portion
of
the

the
result
the
was

apparently
master

the

was
occupied

took
another

at

it

an

orthodoxy

purity

conduct
were
not

inculcated
by
systematic
teaching

enforced
by

opposition

affairs
of

his
influence
was
predominant
the
reformers
were
not
any
more
than
their
adversaries
advocates
of
liberty
in
religious
beliefs
and
professions
a
melancholy
example
of
the
prevailing
idea
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
civil
authority
to
inflict
penalties
upon
heresy
is
the
case
of
a
spaniard
by
birth
with
a
remarkable
aptitude
for
natural
science
and
medicine
adventurous
and
fickle
he
had
published
books
in
which
doctrines
received

both
the
great
divisions
of

the
doctrine
of

escaped

he
was
tried

and
blasphemy
and
was
burned
at

this
was
at

in

contest
with
the
libertines

by
hostility
to

his
religious
system
has
wielded
a
great
power
not
only
on
this
class
but
also
over
the
common
people
in
different
countries
calvinism
was
never
awed
by
monarchical
authority
like
the
church
of
rome
it
always
refused
to
subordinate
the
church
and
religion
to
the
civil
power
it
numbered
among
its
votaries
many
men
of
dauntless
courage
and
of
unbending
fidelity
to
their
principles
the
catholic
the
first
effectual
resistance
to
the
spread
of
protestant
opinions
was
made
in
in
that
country
there
was
opposition
to
the
papacy
from
those
who
saw
in
it
an
instrument
of
political
disunion
and
also
from
some
who
were
aggrieved
by
ecclesiastical
abuses
the
prevailing
feeling
however
was
that
of
pride
in
the
papacy
which
in
other
countries
was
attacked
as
an
italian
institution
the
humanist
learning
had
done
much
to
undermine
belief
in
the
old
religious
system
in
the
train
of
the
new
studies
came
much
indifference
and
infidelity
the
books
of
the
protestant
leaders
however
were
widely
circulated
there
were
not
a
few
sincere
converts
to
the
new
doctrine
in
the
cities
but
they
were
chiefly
confined
to
the
educated
class
and
to
persons
in
high
station
it
took
no
root
among
the
common
people
after
the
time
of
the
medici
popes
a
new
spirit
of
faith
and
devotion
awoke
in
circles
earnestly
devoted
to
the
papacy
and
to
the
church
there
was
at
rome
an
oratory
of
divine
love
a
group
of
persons
who
met
together
for
mutual
edification
in
this
class
were
some
like
afterwards
a
cardinal
who
were
not
wholly
without
sympathy
with
the
lutheran
doctrine
as
to
faith
and
justification
but
out
of
the

class
came
others
who

while
it
aimed

rigid
reform

was
inflexibly
hostile
to
all
innovations

was
bent
on
regaining
for
the
church
the
ground
that
had
been
lost
the

the
council
of
trent
was
governed
in
its
conclusions
by
this
catholic
reactionary
and
reforming
party
it
allowed
no
curtailing
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
pope
on
points
of

within
the
pale
of

providing
a
clear

sentiment

which
still
lingered
in

were

a
provincial
at

all

the
result

proceeded
as
rapidly
as
her
more
prudent
advisers
including
her
kinsman
would
allow
to
restore
the
catholic
system
the
married
clergy
were
excluded
from
their
places
and
the
was
abolished
the
point
where
parliament
showed
most
hesitation
was
in
reference
to
the
royal
supremacy
the
nobles
were
afraid
of
losing
their
fields
and
houses
which
had
belonged
to
the
church
it
was
stipulated
that
the
abbey
lands
which
were
now
held
by
the
nobles
and
gentry
as
well
as
by
the
crown
should
not
be
given
up
personally
was
inclined
to
any
measure
which
obligation
to
the
catholic
religion
might
dictate
contrary
to
the
general
wish
of
her
subjects
she
married
rigorous
measures
of
repression
were
adopted
against
the
protestants
a
large
number
of
persons
eminent
for
talents
and
learning
were
put
to
death
on
the
charge
of
heresy
among
them
were
the
three
bishops
and
who
were
burned
at
the
stake
at
oxford
and
the
rigid
advocates
of
persecution
had
full
sway
these
severe
measures
were
not
popular
and
although
the
queen
was
not
in
her
natural
temper
cruel
they
have
given
her
the
name
of
the
bloody
mary
each
party
used
coercion
when
it
had
the
upper
hand
a
great
number
of
the
protestant
clergy
fled
to
the
continent
sided
with
spain
against
france
and
greatly
to
the
disgust
of
the
english
lost
pope
was
disposed
to
press
upon
england
the
extreme
demands
of
the
catholic
reaction
he
was
moreover
hostile
to
the
house
there
was
great
fear
respecting
the
confiscated
church
property
her
own
share
in
it
the
queen
persuaded
parliament
to
allow
her
to
surrender
cardinal
a
moderate
man
no
longer
guided
her
policy
he
was
deprived
of
the
office
of
papal
legate
general
discontent
prevailed
in
the
kingdom
the
queen
herself
was
dispirited
and
her
life
ended
in
anxiety
and
sorrow
character
of
elizabeth
the
nation
welcomed
elizabeth
to
the
throne
her
will
was
as
imperious
as
that
of
her
father
her
character
was
not
without
marked
faults
and
foibles
she
was
vain
unwisely
parsimonious
petulant
and
overbearing
and
evinced
that
want
of
truthfulness
which
was
too
common
among
rulers
and
statesmen
at
that
period
but
she
had
regal
virtues
high
courage
devotion
to
the
public
good
for
which
she
had
the
strength
to
sacrifice
personal
inclinations
together
with
the
wisdom
to
choose
astute
counselors
and
to
adhere
to
them
her
title
to
the
throne
was
disputed
she
had
to
contend
against
powerful
and
subtle
adversaries
her
defense
lay
in
the
mutual
jealousy
of
france
and
spain
and
in
the
determination
of
englishmen
not
to
be
ruled
by
foreigners
her
reign
was
long
and
glorious
her
religious
in
her
doctrine
was
a
moderate
lutheran
not
bitterly
averse
to
the
church
of
rome
but
in
accordance
with
the
prevalent
english
feeling
which
represented
clinging
to
the
royal
supremacy
the
protestant
system
with
the
and
the
hierarchy
dependent
on
the
sovereign
was
now
restored
protestantism
in
in
case
claim
to
the
crown
were
overthrown
the
next
heir
would
be
queen
of
her
grandmother
was
the
eldest
sister
of
henry
viii
her
claim
to
the
english
crown
was
a
standing
menace
to
when
father
died
she
was
only
a
few
days
old
her
mother
of
became
regent
the
reformation
had
then
begun
to
gain
adherents
in
scotland
on
the
accession
of
at
a
time
when
the
religious
wars
in
france
were
about
to
begin
the
scottish
regent
undertook
repressive
measures
of
increased
rigor
the
principal
agent
in
turning
scotland
to
the
protestant
side
was
an
intrepid
preacher
honest
and
rough
in
his
ways
deeply
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
calvinism
and
free
from
every
vestige
of
superstitious
deference
for
human
potentates
he
returned
from
the
continent
in
many
of
the
turbulent
nobles
partly
from
conviction
and
partly
from
covetousness
adopted
the
new
opinions
more
and
more
however
gained
a
hold
upon
the
common
people
his
preaching
was
effective
one
of
its
natural
consequences
was
an
outburst
of
iconoclasm
even
was
willing
to
have
the
nobles
helped
in
the
contest
with
the
regent
scotland
being
the
ally
of
the
died
in
the
presbyterians
now
had
full
control
and
calvinistic
protestantism
was
legally
established
as
the
religion
of
the
country
the
queen
of
such
was
the
situation
when
the
young
widow
of
came
back
to
scotland
to
assume
her
crown
a
zealous
catholic
she
undertook
to
rule
a
turbulent
people
among
whom
the
most
austere
type
of
protestantism
was
the
legal
and
cherished
faith
she
had
personal
charms
which
lacked
but
as
a
sovereign
she
was
wanting
in
the
public
virtue
which
belonged
to
her
rival
was
and
full
of
energy
but
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
court
of
de
in
an
atmosphere
of
duplicity
and
lax
morals
she
had
the
vices
of
the
an
extravagant
idea
of
the
sacred
prerogatives
of
kings
a
disregard
of
popular
rights
a
willingness
to
break
engagements
her
levity
even
if
it
had
been
kept
within
bounds
would
have
been
offensive
to
her
calvinistic
subjects
she
had
at
heart
the
restoration
of
the
catholic
system
in
she
found
a
vigilant
and
fearless
antagonist
with
so
much
support
among
the
nobles
and
the
common
people
that
her
attempts
at
coercion
like
her
blandishments
proved
powerless
contrary
to
the
wishes
and
plans
of
she
married
a
scottish
nobleman
whom
not
without
reason
she
soon
learned
to
despise
her
a
very
able
man
and
the
other
protestant
nobles
had
been
opposed
to
the
match
she
allowed
herself
an
innocent
but
unseemly
intimacy
with
an
italian
musician
with
the
connivance
of
her
husband
he
was
dragged
out
of
her
at
holyrood
and
brutally
murdered
by
and
other
conspirators
in
the
house
in
which
darnley
was
sleeping
close
by
edinburgh
was
blown
up
with
gunpowder
and
he
was
killed
whether
was
privy
to
the
murder
or
not
is
a
point
still
in
dispute
certain
it
is
that
she
gave
her
hand
in
marriage
to
the
prime
author
of
the
crime
a
revolt
of
her
subjects
followed
she
was
compelled
to
abdicate
was
made
regent
and
her
infant
son
was
crowned

obliged
to
fly
to
england
for
protection
execution
of
elizabeth
had
no
liking
for
the
new
religious
system
in
scotland
she
hated
the
necessity
of
aiding
rebels
against
their
sovereign
but
there
was
no
alternative
in
the
defeat
of
the
huguenots
in
france
was
followed
by
a
catholic
rebellion
in
the
north
of
england
elizabeth
was
excommunicated
by
pope
there
was
a
determination
to
dethrone
her
and
to
hand
over
her
crown
to
mary
the
drift
of
events
was
towards
a
conflict
of
england
with
the
duke
of
a
leader
in
conspiracy
and
rebellion
who
acted
in

the
contest
with
spain
was
kept
up
on
the
sea
by
bold
english
mariners
who
captured
the
spanish
and
harassed
the
spanish
colonies
it
was
a
period
of
maritime
adventure
when
men
like
and
made
themselves
famous
and
when
francis
sailed
around
the
world
in
the
course
of
this
voyage
drake

seized
from

and
from

a
vast
amount
of
silver
and

when
it
was
known
that

drake
sailed
into

there
he

a

under

to
co√∂perate
with

in
there
were
preparations
to
meet
the

were
united
for
the
defense
of
the
kingdom
at

her
troops
on

saying
to
them
in
a
spirited
speech
i
know
i
have
the
body
but
of
a
weak
and
feeble
woman
but
i
have
the
heart
and
stomach
of
a
king
and
of
a
king
of
england
too
the

aiding
the
valor
of
the
english
seamen
dispersed
the
great

no
landing
was
effected
and
the
grand
enterprise
proved
a
complete
failure
only
out
of
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
vessels
succeeded
in
making
their
way
back
to
spain
the
queen
knew
how
to
yield
to
the
people
when
she
saw
that
they
were
determined
upon
a
measure
this
she
did
near
the
close
of
her
reign
when
the
commons
called
upon
her
to
put
an
end
to
the
monopolies
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
granting
to
individuals
whom
she
specially
liked
the
earl
of
the
queen
had
her
personal
favorites
among
them
whom
she
made
the
earl
of
leicester
was
the
one
of
whom
she
was
most
fond
she
esteemed
him
much
above
his
merits
another
of
her
favorites
was
the
young
of
who
was
vain
and
ambitious
he
went
in
with
in
an
expedition
which
took
and
plundered
then
he
was
sent
to
ireland
in
command
of
an
army
he
failed
and
came
back
to
england
without
leave
he
made
a
foolish
attempt
at
insurrection
was
tried
for
treason
and
convicted
and
elizabeth
reluctantly
signed
the
warrant
for
his
execution
conquest
of
after
the
return
of
from
ireland
where
he
had
done
nothing
well
was
sent
to
conquer
the
and
other
irish
chiefs
it
was
a
long
and
fierce
contest
he
succeeded
in
subduing
the
country
but
the
effect
of
his
conquest
was
a
terrible
famine
in
the
north
where
the
food
had
been
destroyed
at
the
end
of
elizabeth
reign
all
ireland
was
subject
to
england
the
uniformity
in
the
forms
of
religious
worship
was
ordained
by
law
in
england
and
the
queen
was
bent
on
enforcing
it
a
of
high
was
established
to
punish
heresy
and
nonconformity
this
policy
early
brought
on
a
conflict
not
only
with
the
roman
catholics
but
also
with
the
large
and
growing
class
of
protestants
who
were
called
puritans
these
wished
to
carry
the
reformation
farther
than
it
had
been
carried
by
the
tudors
in
england
and
to
make
the
english
church
more
like
the
calvinistic
churches
in
scotland
and
on
the
continent
they
disliked
surplices
and
other
vestments
worn
by
the
clergy
which
they
pronounced
badges
of
popery
the
sign
of
the
cross
used
in
baptism
and
like
customs
retained
in
the
church
as
established
by
law
many
of
them
became
opposed
to
the
whole
prelatical
organization
they
did
not
admit
the
supremacy
of
the
sovereign
as
claimed
it
in
things
having
to
do
with
the
church
and
religion
many
of
the
puritans
conformed
to
the
existing
system
of
church
government
and
worship
but
under
a
protest
and
with
the
hope
of
seeing
it
changed
others
were
that
is
they
did
not
formally
break
off
from
the
english
church
but
avoided
taking
part
in
the
forms
of
worship
of
which
they
disapproved
this
class
was
numerous
a
third
and
smaller
class
the
independents
separated
from
the
established
church
and
disbelieved
in
national
churches
or
a
national
organization
of
religion
altogether
they
formed
religious
societies
of
their
own
thus
english
protestants
were
divided
among
themselves
upon
both
puritans
and
roman
catholics
upon
the
latter
partly
on
political
grounds
severe
penalties
were
inflicted
churchman
and
puritan
while
they
agreed
substantially
in
theology
stood
at
variance
in
regard
to
church
government
and
modes
of
worship
chapter
ix
the
english
revolution
and
the
commonwealth
james
of
scotland
and
of
england
was
the
son
of
and
scotland
and
england
were
now
united
under
one
king
he
was
not
wanting
in
acquirements
and
plumed
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
theology
a
conceited
pedant
he
was
impatient
of
dissent
from
his
opinions
in
scotland
among
insubordinate
nobles
and
the
ministers
of
the
kirk
who
on
one
occasion
went
so
far
as
to
pull
his
sleeve
when
they
addressed
to
him
their
rebukes
he
had
hardly
tasted
the
sweets
of
regal
power
the
deference
with
which
the
english
clergy
treated
him
deepened
his
attachment
to
their
church
he
had
high
notions
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
no
bishop
no
king
was
his
favorite
maxim
early
in
the
court
between
the
bishops
and
the
puritans
over
which
james
presided
he
showed
his
antipathy
to
the
puritans
it
may
be
here
stated
that
a
suggestion
there
made
led
to
the
making
of
the
authorized
version
of
the
bible
for
which
previous
translations
especially
the
translation
of
furnished
the
basis

for

which
one
was
to

into
a

with
the
english
authorities
and
with
another
irish

to
spain
the
best
of
their
lands
in
were
given
to
english
and
scotch
colonists
only
what
was
left
of
the
land
was
granted
to
the
irish
many
of
whom
were
dispossessed
of
their
homes
the
ulster
colonies
were
industrious
and
prosperous
but
among
the
natives
seeds
of
lasting
enmity
were
sown
by
this
injustice
james
foreign
the
nation
became
imbittered
against
the
king
one
grievance
was
the
sale
not
only
of
patents
of
nobility
but
also
of
monopolies
to
companies
or
individuals
this
was
a
continuance
of
an
old
abuse
the
trial
and
conviction
of
the
lord
chancelor
who
was
impeached
on
the
charge
of
receiving
presents
which
were
intended
to
influence
his
decisions
as
a
judge
was
one
evidence
of
the
corruption
of
the
times
and
of
the
displeasure
occasioned
by
it
instead
of
aiding
his
the
elector

whose
dominions
had
been

sent
to

busied
himself
with
schemes
for
marrying
his
son
to
the
or
princess
of

the
sister
of
as
a
part
of
his
truckling
to
spain
he
caused
walter
to
be
executed
who
had
no
love
for
spain
had
long
been
kept
in
the
tower
on
the
charge
of
treason
but
the
king
who
wanted
gold
had
permitted
him
to
go
on
a
voyage
to
south
america
to
seek
for
it
there
without
his
fault
some
of
his
men
had
a
collision
with
the
spaniards
up
the
not
having
procured
any
treasure
he
was
disposed
to
attack
spanish
ships
but
the
captains
with
him
would
not
consent
on
his
return
to
england
he
was
again
thrown
into
prison
and
brought
to
the
block
at
length
the
marriage
treaty
with
spain
to
the
joy
of
the
nation
was
broken
off
it
was
agreed
should
marry
the
sister
of
the
king
of
france
the
king
came
to
a
better
understanding
with
parliament
which
had
constantly
opposed
his
policy
and
withstood
his
arrogant
assumption
of
absolute
authority
charles
i
in
dignity
of
person
far
excelled
his
father
he
had
more
skill
and
more
courage
but
he
had
the
same
theory
of
arbitrary
government
and
acted
as
if
insincerity
and
the
breaking
of
promises
were
excusable
in
defense
of
it
his
strife
with
parliament
began
at
once
they
would
not
grant
supplies
of
money
without
a
redress
of
grievances
and
the
removal
of
the
king
favorite

had
begun
with
spain
before
the
close
of
the
last
reign
an
expedition
was
now
sent
to
cadiz
but
it
accomplished
nothing
buckingham
was
impeached
but
before
the
trial
ended
the
king
dissolved
parliament
a
year
later
he
went
to
war
with

he
was
then
obliged
to

on

other
were
the

of
his
adversaries

by
numerous
writers
since
that
day
has
been
considered
a
hypocrite
in

actuated
by
personal
ambition
the
puritan
poet
who
became
his
secretary
after
he
acquired
supreme
power
gives
to
him
the
warmest
praise
for
integrity
and
piety
as
well
as
for
genius
and
valor
of
his
religious
earnestness
after
the
puritan
type
and
of
his
sincere
patriotism
there
is
at

much
less
doubt
as
to
the
transcendent
ability
and
sagacity
that
lay
beneath
a
rugged
exterior
there
has
never
been
any

hoped
much
from
the
growing
discord
between
the
who
favored
an
accommodation
with
him
if
they
could
preserve
their

it
is
certain
that
he
was
to
the
last
honored
by
his

obeyed
by
the
whole
population
of
the
british

and
dreaded
by
all
foreign

that
he
was
laid
among

ancient
sovereigns
of

with
funeral
pomp
such
as
england
had
never

seen

that
he
was
succeeded

as
any

of

deeply
impressed
those
who
heartily
disliked
him
a
strong
illustration
of
this

for

champion
the

subsequently
under
afraid
of
a
schism
and
anxious
to
procure
other
advantages
yielded
up
the
four
obnoxious
propositions
the
controversy
raised
by
the
was
an
important
event
in
the
history
of
france
they
took
their
name
from
who
had
been
bishop
of
an
ardent
disciple
of
theology
they
strenuously
opposed
the
theology
and
moral
maxims
of
the
powerful
jesuit
order
their
leaders
and
others
were
called
from
their
relation
to
a
cloister
at
where
some
of
them
resided
they
were
men
of
literary
and
philosophical
genius
as
well
as
theologians
and
devotees
wrote
the
provincial
letters
a
satirical
and
polemical
work
against
the
jesuit
doctrines
this
has
always
been
deemed
in
style
a
masterpiece
of
french
prose
his
posthumous
is
a
profound
and
suggestive
fragment
on
the
evidences
of
religion
in
the
heated
controversy
that
arose
the
jansenist
leaders
were
for
a
more
limited
definition
of
the
pope
authority
in
deciding
questions
of
doctrine
the
french
court
at
length
took
the
side
of
the
jesuits
in
the
pope
bull
against
the
of
a
jansenist
author
was
a
heavy
blow
at
his
party
finally
the
jansenists
were
proscribed
by
the
king
and
the
cloister
at
port
royal
leveled
to
the
ground
the
jansenist
influence
made
a
part
of
the
tendencies
to
liberalism
that
led
to
the
revolution
at
the
close
of
the
century
the
after
death
the
king
fell
under
the
influence
of
a
party
hostile
to
the
huguenots
fostered
this
feeling
in
him
as
did
de
whom
he
had
secretly
married
and
by
whom
he
was
influenced
through
life
as
he
grew
older
he
sought
to
appease
a
guilty
conscience
by
inflicting
tortures
on
religious
dissenters
he
issued
edicts
of
the
most
cruel
character
he
adopted
the
atrocious
scheme
of
the
or
the
billeting
of
soldiers
over
whom
there
was
no
restraint
in
huguenot
families
in
the
course
of
three
years
fifty
thousand
families
industrious
and
virtuous
people
had
fled
the

in
the
of
the
charter
of

was
revoked
emigration
was
forbidden
yet
not
far
from
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
refugees
escaped
to
enrich
by
their
skill
and
labor
the
protestant
countries
where
they
found
an
asylum
many
of
the
refugees
were
received
by
the
elector
and
helped
to
build
up
then
a
small
city
of
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
france
was
not
only
in
a
degree
impoverished
by
those
who
fled
but
also
by
the
much
larger
number
who
remained
to
be
harassed
and
ruined
by
the
foolish
and
brutal
bigotry
of
their
ruler
the
loss
to
france
by
the
exile
of
the
huguenots
was
incalculable
here

the
thriftiest

these
refugees
gave
what
they
took
from
france
to
her
enemies
for
they
carried
with
them
that
bitter
sense
of
wrong
which
made
them
henceforth
foremost
among
those
enemies
the
forlorn
hope
of
every
attack

there
was
a
terrible
loss
from
this

deprived
them

broke
down
their

this

shattered
a

two
glaring

his
object
was
to
bring
about

he
so
far
succeeded
that
when
surrounded
on

courage

energy
of

obliged
to

in

he
exposed
himself
near
the
trenches
and
was
killed
by
a
bullet
it
was
long
a
question
whether
the
fatal
shot
was
fired
from
the
enemy
or
by
an
assassin
not
until
was
it
settled
by
an
examination
of
the

that
the

was
discharged
from

results
of
the

one
result
of
the
northern
war
was
the
execution
of
to
whom
the
swedish
aristocracy
were
inimical
and
a
reduction
of

the
place
that
sweden
had
held
was
now
taken
by
changes
in
the
czar
took
the
title
of
emperor
he
transferred
the
capital
from

by
constructing
canals
roads
and
harbors
he
promoted
trade
and
commerce
by
fostering
manufactures
and
the
mechanic
arts
and
by
opening
the
mines
he
increased
the
wealth
of
the

he
altered
the
method
of

with

party
that
aimed
to
reverse
the

he
finally
caused
to
be
tried
for
treason
he
was
condemned
but
died
either
from
the
bodily
torture
inflicted
on
him
to
extort
confession
or
as
many
have
believed
by
poison
or
other
means
used
by
the
direction
of
his
father
his
friends
after
being
barbarously
tortured
were
put
to
death
great
as
was
the
work
of
he
brought
russia
prematurely
into
the
circle
of
european
politics
the
result
has
been
to
turn
the
rulers
of
russia
away
from
home
affairs
and
the
regular
development
of
internal
institutions
to
foreign
politics
and
the
creation
of
a
great
military
power
in
his
last
years
the
frugality
of
his
own
way
of
living
in
his
new

was
in
striking
contrast
with
the
splendor
with
which
his
queen
preferred
to
surround
herself

advantages

had
to
bring
their
troops
and
supplies
from

they
were
to
be
sure
disciplined
troops
but
the
english
had
the
substantial
strength
which

the

of
the

were
quickened
intellectually
as
well
as
religiously
by
the
character
of
the
pulpit
discourses
theology
was
an
absorbing
theme
of
inquiry
and
discussion
in
the
especially
in
the
closing
part
of
the
colonial
period
political
affairs
became
a
subject
of
earnest
debate
in
all
the

a
practical
training
in

thousand
was
the
largest
city
in

and
was
held
in

esteem
for
its
intelligence
and
refinement
complaints
of
the
the
colonists
all
acknowledged
the
authority
of
king
and
parliament
but
they
felt
that
they
had
brought
with
them
across
the
ocean
the
rights
of
englishmen
one
thing
that
was
more
and
more
complained
of
was
the
laws
compelling
the
colonies
to
trade
with
the
mother
country
exclusively
and
the
enactments
laying
restraint
on
their
manufactures
in
the
conflicts
with
the
indians
from
time
to
time
the
necessity
had
arisen
for
leagues
and
more
than
once
congresses
of
delegates
had
met
one
of
these
was
held
at
albany
in
where
was
present
in
the
old
french
war
there
had
been
a
call
for
concert
of
action
and
a
deepening
of
the
sense
of
common
interests
and
of
being
really
one
people
new
grounds
of
the
colonies
had
taxed
themselves
in
the
french
war
but
the
condition
of
the
finances
in
england
at
the
close
of
it
inspired
the
wish
there
to
enforce
the
laws
of
trade
more
rigidly
in
america
and
to
levy
additional
taxes
upon
the
provinces
these
english
laws
were
so
odious
that
they
were
often
evaded
the
of
in
massachusetts
authorized
officers
to
search
houses
for
smuggled
goods
in
the
legal
resistance
to
this
measure
a
sentence
was
uttered
by
a
boston
patriot
which
became
a
watchword
taxation
he
said
without
representation
is
tyranny
taxation
it
was
contended
must
be
ordained
by
the
local
colonial
assemblies
in
which
the
are
represented
but
the
requiring
for
legal
and
other
documents
the
use
of
stamped
paper
was
a
form
of
taxation
it
excited
indignation
in
all
the
colonies
especially
in
virginia
and
in
new
england
in
all
the
measures
of
resistance
and
were
foremost
an
impassioned
patriotic
orator
in
the
virginia
legislature
was
very
bold
in
denouncing
the
obnoxious
act
and
the
alleged
right
to
tax
the
colonies
which
it
implied
this
right
was
denied
in
a
where
nine
colonies
were
represented
which
met
in
new
york
in
they
called
for
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
and
declared
against
the
importation
of
english
goods
until
the
repeal
should
be
granted
in
the
house
of
commons
eulogized
the
spirit
of
the
colonies
the
stamp
act
was
repealed
the
discussions
which
it
had
provoked
in
america
had
awakened
the
whole
people
and
made
them
watchful
against
this
sort
of
aggression
political
topics
engrossed
attention
when
parliament
ordered
that
the
colonies
should
support
the
troops
quartered
on
them
and
that
the
royal
officers
should
have
fixed
salaries
to
be
obtained
not
by
the
voluntary
grants
of
colonial
legislatures
but
by
the
levy
of
new
duties
there
was
a
renewed
outburst
of
disaffection
especially
in
and
by
way
of
response
to
a
petition
that
was
sent
to
the
king
against
these
acts
of
parliament
four
regiments
of
troops
were
sent
to
their
presence

a
bitter
grievance
in
one
case
there
was
bloodshed
in
a
broil
in
the
street
between
the
populace
and
the
soldiers
which
was
called
the
boston

on

been
sometimes
attacked
they
had
been
burnt
in

and
in
some
cases
driven
to
resign
in

the
methods
of
resistance
had
been
legal
and
orderly
when
the
news
of
the
destruction
of

by

of
the

political
science
the
most
popular
of
all
the
writers
of

age
was
the
incarnation
of
its
critical
and
skeptical
spirit
the
highest
example
of
its
wit
as
of
its
levity

character

even
to
move
them

sympathy
with
himself
in
a
career
which
deserves
not
less
abhorrence
than
commiseration
he
was
perhaps
the

relish

himself

adam
isaac
the
discoverer

made
through
his
one
of
the
most
important
contributions
ever
made
to
the
advancement
of
physical
science

a
scotchman
who
had
previously
written
on
metaphysics

politics
published
his
treatise
on
wealth
of
the
first
complete
system
of
political
economy
he
showed
that
money
is
not
wealth
but
simply
one
product
serving
as
a
means
of
exchange
he
made
it
clear
that
for
one
nation
to
gain
in

it
is
not

notable
american
writers

were
a
great
metaphysical
genius
and
the
founder
of
a
school
in
theology
and
whose
writings
in
excellent
english
related
mainly
to
ethical
and
economical
topics
as
the
revolution
approached
there
sprung
up
authors
of
ability
on
the
political
questions
of
the
day

after
the

finally
in

to
a

also
in

there
appeared
a
school
of
deistical
writers
beginning
earlier
with

and
continued
through
and
others
on
the

among
the
authors
who
defended

grounds
of
these

the
most
profound
and
the

and
the
most

the

during
this
period
the
society
of

was
founded
in

by
who
in
impelled
by
what
he
considered
a
divine
call
began
the
life
of
an
itinerant
preacher
he
and
his
followers
were
subjected
frequently
to
cruel
persecution
both
in

and
america
in
exceptional
cases
they
fell
into
extravagances
of
enthusiasm
interrupted

clothed
in

or
in
some
instances
naked
they
condemned

objected

to
a
paid
ministry
and
set
an
example
of
the
utmost
plainness
and
simplicity
in
speech
and
dress
among
their
many
converts
were
and
their
able
and
learned
theologian
the
friends
by
their
christian
forbearance
and
patience
their
purity
of
conduct
and
their
philanthropy
and
their
tranquil
piety
gradually
won
the
respect
of
the
other
religious
bodies
who
were
at
first
offended
by
their
novel
tenets
and
manners
and
by
the
occasional
occurrence
of
revolting
manifestations
of
a
enthusiasm
of
the
religious
movements
in
protestant
countries
methodism
is
the
most
noteworthy
this
movement
was
originated
by
a
little
group
of
students
at
oxford
of
whom
his
brother
and
were
the
chief
of
these
united
with
intellectual
ability
and
cultivation
and
religious
fervor
a
remarkable
organizing
capacity
was
an
orator
in
the
pulpit
of
unrivaled
eloquence
he
was
a
calvinist
in
his
theology
and
separated
from
on
account
of
wesley
arminian
views
they
were
nicknamed
methodists
from
their
strictness
of
life
in
the
university
and
their
systematic
ways
and
his
associates
preached
to
the
common
people
in
england
including
the
poor
colliers
and
miners
with
untiring
ardor
and
surprising
effect
their
converts
were
very
numerous
and
were
formed
into
societies
under
a
definite
polity
and
discipline
the
wesleyan
movement
was
much
opposed
in
the
church
of
england
by
those
who
stood
in
dread
of
enthusiasm
by
ordaining
lay
preachers
and
superintendents
for
america
and
by
putting
its
chapels
under
the
protection
of
the
toleration
act
measures
which
deemed
necessary
methodism
became
separate
from
the
anglican
established
church
as
a
distinct
body
it
gained
multitude
of
adherents
in

and
america

on

bohemia
they
founded
a
town
called
became
their
bishop
the
new
community
was
distinguished
for
sincere
piety
and
for
missionary
zeal
they
did
not
in
the
least
antagonize
the
lutheran
churches
yet
had
an
organization
of
their
own
some
of
them
settled
in
america
the
moravians
never
became
a
very
numerous
body
but
their
influence
in
promoting
spiritual
religion
and
education
and
in
carrying
christianity
to
the
heathen
has
been
more
potent
than
that
of
many
larger
bodies
of
christians
it
was
specially
wholesome
in
germany
at
a
time
when
under
the
auspices
of
the
the
french
type
of
unbelief
prevailed
in
the
higher
classes
of
society
prior
to
a
man
of
devout
feeling

given
rise
to
the
pietists

the
promoters

opinion

influences
that
had
sway
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
authority
of
the
popes
sank
in
the
catholic
countries
the
spirit
of
innovation
was
rife
one
of
the
remarkable
incidents
of
the
time
characteristic
of
its
tendency
was
the
conflict
of
portugal
and
the
bourbon
courts
of
france
and
spain
with
the
society
of
jesuits
the
jesuits
had
secretly
established
unobserved
a
state
under
their
own
exclusive
control
in
a
part
of
which
by
a
treaty
of
portugal
with
spain
fell
to
portugal
other
charges
some
relating
to
interference
in
political
affairs
and
some
to
other
and
different
grounds
of
complaint
led
to
the
expulsion
of
the
order
from
all
portuguese
territory
and
soon
after
it
was
suppressed
in
france
and
in
spain
and
in
several
of

italian
states
the
jesuit
order
was
formally
abolished
by
clement

to
be
again
restored
by
papal
authority
in
essays
at
political
reform
russia
the
minds
of
men
were
unsettled
not
only
by
the
prevalent
tone
of
literature
and
speculation
but
by
governmental
changes
and
reforms
the
disposition
was
to
introduce
french
methods
of
administration
of
russia
tried
the
experiment
of
various
judicial
and
educational
reforms
the
with
more
wisdom
and
consistency
introduced
many
changes
for
the
benefit
of
the
industrial
class
the
most
sweeping
reforms
were
undertaken
by
the
emperor
after
the
death
of
his
mother
his
measures
for
the
reduction
of
the
power
of
the
clergy
and
of
the
nobility
the
closing
of
monasteries
and
the
weakening
of
the
connection
of
the
austrian
church
with
rome
were
of
a
very
radical
character
he
himself
finally
became
convinced
that
they
were
too
radical
to
be
completely
realized
in
the
existing
state
of
opinion
among
his
subjects
two
of
his
reforms
the
abolition
of
serfdom
and
the
edict
of
religious
toleration
remained
in
force
the
other
changes
did
not
survive
him
the
attempts
to
impose
his
reforms
in
the
austrian
netherlands
provoked
an
insurrection
ii
successor
suppressed
the
belgian
revolt
but
repealed
the
ordinances
of
his
brother
which
had
occasioned
it
in
tuscany
the
brother
of
leopold
prior
to
his
becoming
emperor
undertook
likewise
a
great
plan
of
ecclesiastical
reform
in
the
same
line
as
that
of
but
there
the
opposition
of
the
bishops
prevented
him
from
practically
carrying
out
his
scheme
in
portugal
the
house
of
had
ascended
the
throne
in
left
the
management
of
the
government
to
his
minister
his
measures
were
contrived
to
weaken
the
power
of
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
by
him
the
warfare
against
the
jesuits
was
carried
forward
the
fall
of
which
followed
the
death
of
the
king
led
to
the
abolition
of
all
his
reforms

iv
the
era
of
the
french
revolution
introduction
character
of
the
the
french
revolution
was
a
tremendous
upheaval
of
society
which
brought
with
it
the
abolition
of
feudalism
and
monarchy
and
the
securing
of
an
equality
of
political
rights
its
immediate
result
in
france
was
the
establishment
of
a
democratic
republic
followed
by
an
empire
resting
on
military
power
its
conquests
and
the
predominance
of
france
provoked
an
uprising
of
the
other
european
peoples
in
behalf
of
national
independence
this
overthrew
the
french
empire
and
produced
a
temporary
restoration
of
the
old
dynasty
but
the
effect
of
the
revolution
in
which
the
other
civilized
nations
largely
shared
was
the
substitution
in
the
room
of
the
of
the
resting
on
a
broader
basis
of
equality
as
regards
the
rights
and
obligations
of
different
classes
in
the
western
nations
of
the
continent
serfdom
and
manifold
abuses
civil
and
ecclesiastical
were
abolished
causes
of
the
first
among
the
causes
of
the
revolution
in
france
was
the
hostility
felt
towards
the
privileged
classes
the
king
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
on
account
of
the
disabilities
and
burdens
which
law
and
custom
imposed
on
the
classes
beneath
them
when
organized
a
standing
army
and
laid
direct
taxes
to
support
it
the
burghers
and
peasants
rejoiced
the
monarchy
was
thus
enabled
to
shield
them
and
subdue
the
great
nobles
as
long
as
he
was
successful
was
sustained
by
the
pride
and
national
spirit
of
the
country
yet
his
domination
over
the
nobility
and
the
church
left
the
higher
orders
in
possession
not
only
of
the
offices
and
honors
which
helped
to
fasten
them
submissively
to
the
monarch
but
also
left
them
in
the
exercise
of
the
numberless
complicated
privileges
of
local
rule
and
taxation
privileges
which
were
the
growth
of
ages
and
which
laid
on
the
necks
of
the
people
a
yoke
too
heavy
to
be
borne
the
land
the
nearly
of
the
land
in
france
was
in
the
hands
of
the
nobles
and
of
the
clergy
a
great
part
of
it
was
ill
cultivated
by
its
indolent
owners
the
nobles
preferred
the
gayeties
of
paris
to
a
residence
on
their
estates
there
were
many
small
but
many
had
individually
too
little
land
to
furnish
them
with
subsistence
the
treatment
of
the
peasant
was
often
such
that
when
he
looked
upon
the
towers
of
his
lord
castle
the
dearest
wish
of
his
heart
was
to
burn
it
down
with
all
its
registers
of
debt
there
was
not
a
large
middle
class
of
possessed
of
farms
which
although
small
were
yet
adequate
to
yield
them
a
living
the
clergy
besides
having
the
whole
management
of
education
held
an
immense
amount
of
land
seigniorial
control
over
thousands
of
peasants
and
a
vast
income
from
tithes
and
other
sources
in
some
provinces
there
was
a
better
state
of
things
than
in
others
but
in
general
the
rich
had
the
enjoyments
and
the
poor
carried
the
burdens
manufactures
and
trade
although
encouraged
under

fettered
by
oppressive
monopolies
and
a
strict
organization
of
guilds
corrupt
the
administration
of
government
was
both
arbitrary
and
corrupt
places
in
parliament
and
in
the
army
and
most
higher
offices
were
sold
but
sold
as
a
rule
only
to
nobles

refused
to

a
contest
arose
at

on
the
question
whether
there
should
be
three
houses
or
whether
all
the

should

the

insisted
on

they
persisted
against
the

will
in
sitting
apart
until
at
his
request
the
other
orders
gave
away
and
joined

it
was

not

however
that
so

money
should
be
raised
by

of
taxation
and
the

be
paid
on

the
attempts
of
to
dissolve
the

were
firmly
resisted
by
the

which
was
joined
by

victory
of

and
because
they
could
not
trust
the

of
the

procured
the
substitution
for

of
german
and
swiss
troops
the
excitement
caused
by
this
proceeding
and
the
news
of
dismissal
led
to
a
mob
of
the
rough
parisian
populace
who
seized
weapons
from
the
workshops
and
forced
the
surrender
of
the
the
grim
old
prison

political
offenders
had
been
immured
the

monument
of
ages
of

tyranny
which
they
razed

the

now
to

abroad
the
passions
of
the

were
to

inflamed
by
the
suspicion
of

complicity
of
the

absent
supporters
who
strove

some
reason
to

was
not
great

whatever
the

the
evils
of

far
more
to

the

appeared
bright
on

of
three
hundred

clad
in

officiated
at

then
the
president
of

which
exalted
all

to
a

proved
before
long
to

an
illusive
dream
the

was
not

to
confirm
the

respecting

which
made
them
civil

nor
was
he
ready
to

no

this

proceeding
of

coupled
with
his
formal
annulling
of
all
that

done
in

two
years
previous

for
its
natural
consequence
his
suspension

voted
to

thus

the

the

after

burlesque
trial

the

at
first
the

the

led
by
the
of
who
called

by
the

by

the
the
a
machine
for
beheading
which
a
physician
did
not
invent
but
recommended
for
use
was
the
instrument
on
which
the
fanatical
revolutionists
placed
most
of
their
reliance
for
the
extirpation
of

the
energy
of

the
general
dread
of
a

by
the
fury
of

strong
for
the

from

to

the
first
execution
of
the

was
the
signal
for
the
union
of
the
european
powers
against
france
the
intention
of
the
revolutionary
party
to
propagate
their
system
in
other
countries
afforded
one
excuse
for
this
interference
the
convention
had
offered
their
assistance
to
peoples
wishing
to
throw
off
the
existing
governments
another
reason
was
the
recent
annexations
and
the
proceedings
in
respect
to
the
free
navigation
of
the
the
main
ground
and
cement
of
the

was
the
dread
which
the

felt
of
revolutionary
movements
among
their
own
subjects
from
their
sympathy
with
the
new
institutions
in

the
reason
just
mentioned

operative
in

their

control
which

long
continued
was
a
constant
aim

this
result
he

the

his
office

leader
of
the
liberal
party
was
james
a
man
of
noble
talents
and
generous
instincts
but
notoriously
irregular
in
his
habits
the
sympathy
in

with

was
widely
diffused
however
the
great
philosophical
statesman
who
had
defended
the
cause
of

in

was
alarmed
by
the
events
in
france
and
still
more
by
the
theories
of
human
rights
propounded
by
the
enthusiastic
friends
of

these
ideas
were
set
forth
in
england
in
an
offensive
form
in
the
writings
of

in
his
on

he
attacked
as
visionary
the
political
notions
of

french
school
in

denounced
them
for
their
dangerous
tendency

jacobin
leaders
to
collect

and
to
strengthen
the

force
the
three
chiefs
were
and
there
was
a
mortal
struggle
between
the
advocates
of
order
and
the
apostles
of
anarchy
the
fate
of
the
moderates
and
girondists
was
sealed
by
a
great
insurrection
in
paris
and
an
invasion
of
the

by

the
violent
party
had
at
their
back
eighty

their

which

behind
it
triumphed
war
of
la
outside
of
in
other
parts
of
france
there
were
risings
against
the
jacobin
rule
the
most
formidable
of
these
was
in
the
west
where
the
relation
of
the
nobles
to
the
peasants
had
been
kindly
and
where
the
common
people
looked
on
the
violent
proceedings
at
paris
with
anger
and
disgust
thus
began
the
war
of
a
terrible
episode
of
civil
strife
in
which
the
people
of
that
region
were
subdued
but
not
until
after
protracted
conflict
and
immense
slaughter
the
jacobin
and
the
other
revolutionary
leaders
showed
a
tremendous
energy
in
their
attack
on
both
domestic
and
foreign
enemies
a
levy
was
ordered
of
the
whole
male
population
capable
of
bearing

was
fixed
by

for

also
for

paid
its

in
depreciated

the
face
value
its
emissaries
were
in
all
parts
of
france
stirring
up
the
people
and
forming
revolutionary
committees
thus
a
system
of
revolutionary
government
was
everywhere
established
a
new
of
an
extreme
democratic
type
was
offered
to
the
acceptance
of
the
people
this
dominion
of
the
it
must
be
observed
was
a
second
revolution
the
revolution
of
was
as
different
from

was
the
proposed

of
from
that
of
the
insurrections
except
at

and
in

soon
quelled
the
jacobin
rule
was
identified
with
the
cause
of
patriotism

against

with
antipathy
to
the
restoration
of

military
successes
of
achievements
of
the
great
coalition
were
not
at
all
in
proportion
to
its
apparent
strength
it
was
weakened
by
mutual
jealousies
and
inefficient
commanders
in
the
south
the
spaniards
and
piedmontese
did
not
profit
by
their
successes
in

the
summer
of

partly
wasted
by
the
english
austrians
and
prussians
in
long
sieges
and
in
dissensions
among
themselves
meantime
the
french

was
growing

his

himself
never
became
so
fully
master
of
the
french
tongue
that
he
did
not
betray
in
his
speech
his
foreign
extraction
he
was
educated
at
the
military
school
of
and
then
went
to
the
military
school
at
his
principal
studies
were
mathematics
and
history
he
quickly
made
manifest
his
military
talents
and
seems
first
to
have
aspired
to
gain
distinction
and
power
in
this
line
in
corsica
his
connection
was
at

with

he
afterwards
denied
it

had
imbibed
the
ideas
of

saw
that
in
the
service
of

in

there
was
opened
to
him
a
military
career
he
turned
against

established
itself
in

the

every

was
thrown
into

even
to

in

to

was
a
serious
offense
summary
trials
were
followed
by
swift
executions
the
tenderness
of

and
the
venerableness
of

were
no
protection
day
after

the
stream
of
human
blood
continued
to
flow
a
new

was
ordained
was
the
beginning
of

there
was
a

began
a
crusade
against
christianity
fashions
of
dress
modes
of
speech
and
manners
were
revolutionized
every
vestige
of
aristocracy
was
to
be
swept
off
the
earth
there
was
a
wild
license
given
to
divorce
and
to
profligacy
was
like
a
camp
where
young
soldiers
were
drilled
weapons
were
forged
and
lint
and
bandages
made
ready
for
the
wounded
there
were
seen
even
in
the
hall
of
the
convention
throngs
of
coarse
and
fierce
men
and
of
coarser
and
fiercer
women
with
their
songs
and
wild
outcries
and
gestures
the
commune
of
instituted
a
sacrilegious
festival
in
the
ancient
cathedral
of
notre
dame
where
an
actress
was
enthroned
as
goddess
of
liberty
there
were
priests
and
bishops
who
abjured
the
christian
faith
and
there
were
others
who
adhered
to
it
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
the
prisons
which
were
packed
with
all
classes
were
theaters
of
strange
and
thrilling
scenes
in
many
cases
death
made
familiar
ceased
to
terrify
crowds
escorted
the
batch
of
victims
carried
on
carts
each
day
to
the

insulted
them
with

the
tragic
scenes
through
which
she
had
passed
miserably
clad
was
dragged
before
the
merciless
tribunal
there
she
was
insulted
with
foul
accusations
which
nobody
believed
after
the
mockery
of
a
trial
she
was
carried
like
a
common
criminal
in
a
cart
with
her
arms
bound
to
the
place
of
execution
her
dignity
and
serenity
her
pallid
countenance
and
the
simple
pathetic
words
uttered
by
her
at
her
arraignment
touched
for
the
moment
the
hardened
hearts
of
the
imbruted
spectators
her
sad
fate
has
blinded
many
to
the
calamitous
errors
committed
by
her
in
the
days
of
her
power
the

the
reign
of

was
not
confined
to
paris
the
unexampled
atrocities
there
were
repeated
in
the
other
large
towns
with
like
circumstances
of
barbarity
a
species
of
fanaticism
ruled
and
raged
in
the
land
the
mania
if
one
may
so
call
it
reached
its
height
in
such
chiefs
of
the
revolutionary
party
as
and
in
especially
the
mastery
gained
by
one
idea
almost
amounted
to
mental
disorder
he
demanded
first
five
hundred
heads
then
in
forty
thousand
then
six
weeks
later
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
it
did
seem
to
be
a
homicidal
mania
was
assassinated
by
a
young
maiden
who
devoted
herself
to
the
task
of
ridding
the
world
of
such
a
monster
death
of
the
jacobin
leaders
found
their
ideal
of
virtue
in
the
spartan
spirit
infatuated
by
theory
of
the
omnipotence
of
the
state
in
which
the
individual
is
merged
and
lost
under
the
despotism
of
the
majority
they
looked
on
the
massacre
of
countless
persons
guilty
of
no
crime
as
a
good
deed
at
length
men
began
to
grow
weary
of
this
frightful
tyranny
the
leaders
became
divided
among
themselves
though
often
the
advocate
of
violent
measures
was
a
statesman
and
to
his
credit
be
it
said
halted
at
a
point
where
the
others
advanced
he
made
an
objection
to
the
confounding
of
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
and
the
leaders
of
the
commune
with
their
atheism
as
dangerous
political
rivals
were
offensive
to
who
was
a
deist
he
held
a
sort
of
middle
position
had
most
power
with
the
jacobins
and
was
enabled
to
crush
and
destroy
his
associates
he
was
a
dull
man
of
a
quiet
mien
often
seen
with
a
nosegay
in
his
hand
and
bloodthirsty
according
to
a
precise
theory
his
ascendency
gave
him
the
power
after
scenes
of
tempestuous
debate
to
inflict
first
on
on
and
his
other
confederates
and
then
on
and
the
dantonist
chiefs
the
same
death
by
the
guillotine
to
which
they
had
doomed
so
many
abolished
the
worship
of
reason
and
caused
the
convention
to
pass
a
resolution
acknowledging
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
in
whose
honor
f√™tes
were
held
christianity
was
denounced
as
a
base
superstition
cruelties
in
the
when
was
supreme
the
reign
of
terror
became
still
more
terrible
in
trials
the
hearing
of
evidence
and
of
argument
were
dispensed
with
the
prisons
were
crowded
with
suspects
alleged
conspiracies
in
prisons
were
made
a
pretext
for
wholesale
slaughter
under
the
guillotine
suicide
and
madness
were
of
common
occurrence
even
before

there
had
been
in
the
provinces
scenes
of
horror
like
those
which
occurred
in
the
capital
the
revolted
cities
as

were
punished
with
savage
ferocity
at
men
women
and
children

down
with
artillery
those
who
were
not
killed
with
the
shot
were
cut
in
pieces
by
the
soldiery
at
prisoners
were
bound
together
in

huddled
together

in

caused

a
secret
article
ceded
permanently
its
territories
on

the
soldiers
of
france
were
fast
becoming
trained
and
their
confidence
rose
with
their
increasing
success
this
success
was
due
largely
to
the
weak
generalship
of
the
allies
the
french
were
commonly
hard
masters
in
the
conquered
places
on
the
other
hand
however
they
effected
a
welcome
abolition

feudal
inequalities

constitution
of
meanwhile
there
was
disaffection
especially
in
the
cities
with
the
rule
by

convention
in
the
cities
there
was
distress
except
in
the
moneyed
class
there
was
a
yearning
for
a
strong
and
stable
government
the
convention
framed
and
submitted
to
the
nation
a
new
constitution
the
in
the
order
of
political
fabrics
of
this
sort
there
were
to
be
seven
hundred
and
fifty
legislators
divided
into
two
bodies
the
council
of

or
the
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
of
five
the
executive
power
was
given
to
a
of
five
persons
of
the
councils
for
the
first
term
were
to
be
taken
from
the
convention
the
constitution
thus
conservative
and
in
its
character
was
well
received
but
there
was
dissatisfaction
in
the
reactionary
parties
and
a
great
insurrection
of
the
royalist
middle
class
in
paris
the
was
promptly
put
down
by
the
resolute
action
of
to
whom
had
been
given
the
command
of
the
troops
of
the
city
it
was
the
royalist
and
the
parties
which
now
threatened
the
government
but
a
new
authority
the
will
of
the
was
beginning
plainly
to
disclose
itself
the
dread
of
jacobinism
still
existed
what
the
people
more
and
more
craved
was
internal
tranquillity
and
order
bonaparte
in
italy
to
the
peace
of
campo
the
assignats
became
worthless
this
bankruptcy
had
one
benefit
it
relieved
the
state
of
its
debt
and
brought
coin
into
circulation
a
triple
attack
was
planned
by
against
austria
in
germany
and
were
driven
back
by
the
archduke
of
austria
but
a
splendid
success
attended
the
arms
of
in
the
attack
on
the
austrian
power
in
italy
he
had
been
lately
married
to
the
widow
of
a
french
general
guillotined
in
the
only
woman
to
whom
he
appears
ever
to
have
been
warmly
attached
there
were
two
children
by
her
former
marriage
and
who
married
starting
from
nice
and
following
the
coast
bonaparte
defeated
the
austrians
and
piedmontese
separately
and
forced
the
latter
to
conclude
a
distinct
peace
which
ceded
and
to
france
he
exemplified
in
this
campaign
the
characteristics
which
in
contributed
essentially
to
his
success
as
a
general
he
struck
the
enemy
before
they
could
combine
their
forces
he
did
not
after
the
old
method
wait
to
capture
all
the
fortresses
in
his
path
but
by
swift
marches
made
his
attacks
at
unexpected
places
and
times
he
defeated
the
austrians
after
a
brief
struggle
at
the
bridge
of
on
the
adda
captured
overran
lombardy
as
far
as
mantua
and
forced
the
pope
and
parma
modena
and
naples
to
purchase
peace
by
giving
up
their
treasures
of
art
thus
began
the
custom
of
despoiling
conquered
capitals
and
other
subjugated
cities
of
works
of
art
which
went
to
adorn
and
enrich
paris
a
new
custom
among
civilized
christian
nations
the
veteran
austrian
general
was
defeated
in
a
series
of
engagements
and
after
him
another
great
austrian
army
under
was
vanquished
at
and
at
now
crossed
the
alps
to
meet
the
archduke
who
had
cleared
germany
of
its
invaders
the
french
general
although
his
own
situation
was
not
free
from
peril
was
able
to
dictate
the
terms
of
peace
in
the
treaty
of
austria
ceded
the
belgian
provinces
to
france
recognized
the
to
be
established
by
in
north
italy
and
secretly
consented
to
the
cession
of
the
german
provinces
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
in
return
he
gave
to
austria
in
disregard
of
the
principles
of
international
law
and
perfidiously
as
regards
that
republic
which
had
made
its
peace
with
him
and
become
a
democracy
dependent
on
france
in
this
treaty
with
austria
there
was
another
secret
stipulation
that
prussia
should
not
be
indemnified
in
germany
for
her
losses
on
the
west
of
the
rhine
thus
used
the
selfishness
of
the
allies
to
divide
them
from
one
another
at
in
february
the
pope
had
ceded
for
the
the
and
a
young
man
of
bonaparte
had
given
proof
of
his
astonishing
military
genius
by
a
series
of
victories
over
large
armies
and
experienced
generals
and
he
had
evinced
equally
his
skill
as
well
as
his
lack
of
principle
in
the
field
of
diplomacy
he
had
won
admiration
from
his
enemies
by
his
evident
freedom
from
the
revolutionary
fanaticism
and
his
contempt
for
declamation
about
the
rights
of
man
returning
to
he
was
received
with
acclamation
but
thought
it
politic
to
avoid
publicity
and
to
live
quietly
in
his
modest
dwelling
coup
fructidor
during
absence
the
royalist
and
reactionary
faction
had
gained
ground
in
the
governing
bodies
was
plotting
on
that
side
these
schemes
had
been
baffled
with
the
timely
assistance
of
a
detachment
of
troops
sent
to
by
bonaparte
under
on
the
fructidor
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
where
the
councils
met
was
surrounded
the
reactionary
deputies
were
arrested
and
his
were
banished
this
sealed
the
triumph
of
the
republicans
but
it
was
effected
through
the
army
the
egyptian
the
directory
were
conscious
of
weakness
and
looked
with
alarm
and
distrust
on
the
young
general
who
was
fast
becoming
the
idol
of
the
people
as
well
as
of
the
army
they
wished
him
to
attempt
a
descent
on
england
he
preferred
in
the
room
of
this
impracticable
venture
to
conduct
an
expedition
to
with
the
design
of
getting
control
if
possible
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
and
of
striking
at
the
possessions
of
great
britain
in
to
this
scheme
the
directory
quite
willing
to
have
him
at
a
distance
readily
consented
hiding
his
plans
until
all
was
ready
he
sailed
from
may
with
a
strong
fleet
and
army
on
his
way
captured
through
treachery
of
the
knights
and
landed
safely
in
egypt
with
him
were
some
of
the
best
of
the
french
generals
and
a
large
company
of
scientific
men
he
defeated
the
in
a
great
battle
fought
within
sight
of
the
but
at
in
the
of
the
the
french
fleet
was
destroyed
by
the
english
naval
force
under
the
french
army
was
thus
cut
off
from
the
means
of
return
bonaparte
invaded
but
was
prevented
by
the
english
fleet
from
getting
a
foothold
on
the
coast
he
had
to
raise
the

however
to

cost
at

the

of

followed
by
acts
on
the
part
of
napoleon
which
show
the
presumptuous
confidence
and
arrogant
spirit
of
domination
which
however
natural
on
the
pinnacle
of
might
to
which
he
had
raised
himself
proved
disastrous
and
in
the
end
fatal
one
of
these
acts
was
the
continental
system
ordained
in
the

a

decree
prussia

a

to
close
the

the

this
led

prohibiting

as
if
they
were
blockaded

continental

thus
originated

to
cut
off

between
the
entire

all
the
merchandise
of

her
colonies
to
be
seized

confiscated
wherever
it
might
be
found
even

the
design

it

effect

still

imperious
and
arrogant
domination
was
felt
to
be
insupportable
but
the
circumstance
that
determined
the
course
of
austria
was
the
victory
gained
by
at
vittoria
in
spain
over
the
french
under
june
the
news
of
it
turned
the
scale
in
the
austrian
councils
the
odds
against
napoleon
were
now
fearful
especially
as
his
own
army
was
largely
composed
of
recruits
who
were
hardly
above
the
age
of
boys
he
won
one
more
triumph
at
but
this
was
his
last
victory
on
german
soil
the
allies
avoided
the
errors
which
he
had
taught
them
to
avoid
and
succeeded
in
bringing
their
forces
together
and
in
compelling
napoleon
to
fight
at
the
allied
armies
numbered
three
hundred
thousand
while
the
french
force
did
not
exceed
a
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
the
battle
of
the
nations
lasted
for
three
days
although
the
fighting
was
chiefly
on
the
first
and
third
on
the
last
day
it
continued
for
nine
hours
the
saxon
contingent
abandoned
the
french
on
the
field
and
went
over
to
the
allies
the
defeat
of
the
french
as
night
approached
became
a
rout
napoleon
with
the
remnant
of
his
army
was
driven
to
the
rhine
the
battle
of
was
really
the
decisive
contest
in
the
wars
of
europe
against
napoleon
from
the
defeat
there
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
recover
fall
of
napoleon
the
members
of
the
of
the
joined
the
allies
rose
in
revolt
and
drove
out
the
french
officials
even
was
exhausted
and
full
of
discontent
meantime
defeated
in
the
pyrenees
and
invaded
france
from
that
side
was
bent
on
resistance
and
by
his
superior
skill
succeeded
in
ousting
the
brave
prussian
soldier
but
inexpert
strategist
bl√ºcher
as
well
as
the
austrian
general
and
but
the
preponderance
of
numbers
on
the
side
of
the
allies
was
too
great
their
bold
decision
to
march
on
paris
secured
their
triumph
the
city
surrendered
march
had
lost
his
hold
on
the
ruling
bodies
the
senate
through
the
influence
of
the
astute
once
his
minister
declared
that
he
and
his
family
had
forfeited
the
throne
at
he
signed
his
abdication
in
favor
of
his
son
april
but
this
condition
was
rejected
the
small
island
of
was
given
to
him
by
the
allies
as
a
sovereign
principality
after
a
pathetic
farewell
to
his
veteran
guard
he
betook
himself
to
his
small
dominion
the
brother
of
was
placed
on
the
throne
of
france
france
by
the
of
may
was
left
with
its
ancient
boundaries
as
they
were
before
the
revolution
slightly
increased
the
according
to
a
promise
which
the
king
had
given
he
june
promulgated
a
constitutional
charter
a
name
borrowed
from
the
middle
ages
when
charters
were
granted
to
vassals
there
was
to
be
a
legislature
with
a
house
of
peers
or
lords
appointed
by
the
king
and
a
chamber
of
deputies
chosen
by
limited
suffrage
the
electors
to
be
owners
of
property
to
a
certain
amount
and
to
be
thirty
years
old
the
king
was
to
have
the
initiative
in
legislation
the
roman
catholic
religion
was
declared
to
be
the
religion
of
the
state
but
liberty
was
given
to
dissenters
the
right
to
make
peace
and
war
was
given
to
the
king
and
also
the
right
to
issue
ordinances
necessary
for
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
the
safety
of
the
state
this
last
provision
opened
a
door
for
arbitrary
government
and
paved
the
way
for
the
downfall
of
the
dynasty
the
points
of
resemblance
in
the
constitution
to
the
english
system
were
adapted
to
provoke
a
constant
contrast
with
it
in
respect
to
the
degree
of
liberty
actually
secured
and
exercised
by
the
people
the
charter
was
dated
from
the
nineteenth
year
of
louis
as
if
there
had
been
no
republic
or
empire
pius
pope
who
after
was
a
virtual
prisoner
at
refused
to
comply
with
demands
he
could
not
be
moved
to
invest
the
bishops
whom
the
emperor
had
appointed
this
was
a
principal
point
in
the
dispute
napoleon
called
a
national
council
of
french
bishops
in
the
pope
was
taken
to
and
treated
by
him
with
harshness
when
the
pontiff
refused
to
give
a
full
and
final
sanction
to
the
proposed
agreement
until
he
should
be
free
to
confer
with
his
cardinals
he
was
treated
with
still
greater
severity
the
fall
of
napoleon
set
him
free
and
he
entered
rome
may

the
congress

met
to

the

and
a

and
was
one
of
the
representatives

the
conferences
were
far
from
being

in

the
claims
of
russia
upon
poland
and
the
claims
of
prussia
on
germany
threatened
another
war
while
the
debates
alternating
with
gay
festivities
were
still
proceeding
the
participants
were
startled
by
the
news
of
the
reappearance
of
in
france
return
of
napoleon
from
the
new
bourbon
rule
was
unpopular
with
the
french
it
was
felt
to
be
the
effect
and
sign
of
national
humiliation
the
offensive
conduct
of
the
returned
emigrant
nobility
and
measures
looking
towards
a
restoration
of
bygone
abuses
in
government
fomented
the
disaffection
while
apparently
busy
in
laying
out
roads
and
canals
and
regulating
the
affairs
of
his
little
kingdom
which
was
only
sixty
miles
in
circumference
kept
himself
well
informed
as
to
the
state
of
public
opinion
in
france
with
a
few
hundred
men
of
the
imperial
guard
he
landed
at
march
i
and
was
joined
by
one
regiment
after
another
which
were
sent
out
to
crush
him
one
of
the
best
of
his
marshals
was
carried
away
by
the
common
feeling
and
went
over
to
the
side
of
his
old
commander
fled
from
paris
and
on
march
was
again
installed
in
the
tuileries
napoleon
offered
to
the
country
a
more
liberal
constitution
but
the
bourbons
were
more
hated
than
he
was
trusted
he
professed
to
the
great
powers
his
desire
for
peace
but
they
did
not
listen
to
these
assurances
each
agreed
to
furnish
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
men
to
serve
against
him
he
put
forth
prodigious
exertions
to
gather
a
force
with
which
to
meet
the
host
of
his
enemies
and
although
he
could
appeal
to
no
warm
national
feeling
such
as
had
called
into
being
the
armies
of
the
revolution
he
succeeded
in
bringing
together
a
force
of
over
one
hundred
thousand
men
he
decided
not
to
wait
for
the
attack
but
to
assail
the
two
armies
of
and
in
belgium
his
plan
was
to
attack
them
separately
so
far
fell
into
the
trap
that
in
his
eagerness
to
meet
the
detested
foe
he
offered
battle
to
napoleon
at
june
and
after
a
desperate
contest
was
forced
to
retire
from
the
field
on
the
same
day
so
far
checked
in
his
attack
at
that
he
could
not
strike
the
prussians
on
the
flank
as
napoleon
had
designed
napoleon
thought
that
the
prussians
would
not
be
able
after
their
defeat
at
once
to
aid
wellington
he
sent
however
with
thousand
men
to
observe
them
and
inflict
on
them
a
final
blow
on
the
forenoon
of
june

but
all
their
charges

main
line
were
met
and
repelled
by
the
immovable
squares
of
the
british
infantry
in
the
afternoon
napoleon
right
began
to
be
assailed
by
the
prussians
and
finding
at
seven
that
they
were
coming
in
great
force
he
ordered
a
charge
of
the
imperial
guard
on
wellington
forces
after
a
fierce
struggle
the
guard
was
compelled
to
recoil
and
retire

its
defeat

he

to
have
mistaken

the

napoleon
fled
to
and
finding
himself
unable

surrendered
to
the
british
admiral
and
was
taken
on
board
the
was
brought
back
to
paris
by
the
agreement
of
the
allies
was
conveyed
to
the
island

he
remained
a
fretful
captive
until
his
death
may
escaped

and
shot
france

a
war
indemnity
of
seven
hundred
million
francs
its
boundaries
were
fixed
as
at
character
of
respecting
certain
traits
of
napoleon
there
is
no
dispute
his
military
genius
all
allow
although
his
daring
was
sometimes
and
there
are
critics
who
profess
to
discern
after
the
beginning
of
the
russian
campaign
and
especially
in
the
last
contest
in
belgium
signs
of
a
decline
in
his
almost
superhuman
vigilance
and
energy
yet
all
must
admit
that
transcendent
geometrical
faculty
as
calls
it
which
characterized
napoleon
and
which
that
powerful
genius
applied
to
war
with
the
same
ease
and
the
same
aptitude
that
monge
a
great
french
mathematician
applied
it
to
other
subjects
no
general
ever
had
greater
power
to
fascinate
soldiers
and
secure
their
devotion
to
him
one
reason
was
that
he
recognized
and
rewarded
merit
wherever
he
saw
it
his
intellectual
movements
were
as
much
swifter
than
the
ordinary
as
his
marches
were
more
rapid
than
those
to
which
armies
had
been
accustomed
for
civil
organization
and
administration
he
had
rare
talents
and
in
many
directions
enlightened
views
europe
owes
much
to
his
innovations
in
this
sphere
he
was
not
incapable
of
warm
personal
attachments
as
was
manifested
for
example
in
his
grief
over
the
favorite
general
who
fell
at
but
an
insatiable
appetite
for
war
and
still
more
a
conviction
which
he
sometimes
confessed
that
he
could
retain
and
fortify
his
authority
only
by
dazzling
france
and
continuing
to
astonish
mankind
by
brilliant
achievements
drove
him
forward
on
a
path
of
aggression
and
bloodshed
he
had
an
unpitying
nature
he
was
careless
of
human
suffering
early
in
his
career
in
italy
he
ordered
a
needless
and
useless
attack
on
the
outposts
of
the
enemy
to
treat
a
lady
to
a
sight
of
real
war
he
did
not
shrink
from
ordering
two
thousand
prisoners
at
to
be
shot
he
shocked
all
germany
by
causing
a
bookseller
of
nuremberg
to
be
shot
for
refusing
to
tell
the
name
of
the
author
of
a
publication
offensive
to
him
he
frequently
displayed
a
petty
rancor
as
for
example
in
leaving
a
legacy
in
his
will
to
the
man
who
was
accused
of
an
attempt
to
assassinate
the
of
his
violence
of
temper
as
in
the
murder
of
the
hurried
him
into
acts
that
were
not
less
impolitic
than
criminal
his
tyrannical
will
would
brook
no
contradiction
even
in
matters
trifling
importance
he
broke
away
from
engagements
when
he
thought
it
advantageous
to
do
so
it
is
not
an
injustice
to
say
that
he
was
habitually
untruthful
his
bulletins
were
disfigured
by
flagrant
falsehoods
as
well
as
gross
exaggerations
in
a
letter
to
from
italy
he
says
this
is
history
what
i
say
in
my
proclamations
and
speeches
is
a
romance
with
his
wonderful
intellectual
powers
inexhaustible
energy
and
amazing
achievements
he
never
quite
loses
the
characteristic
spirit
of
an
adventurer
he
is
haunted
by
a
secret
consciousness
that
this
character
belongs
to
him
the
judgment
of
an
adversary
must
be
taken
with
allowance
but
spoke
at
least
without
passion
when
he
said
bonaparte
whole
life
civil
political
and
military
was
a
fraud
there
was
not
a
transaction
great
or
small
in
which
lying
and
fraud
were
not
introduced
his
foreign
policy
was
force
and
menace
aided
by
fraud

corruption

the
of
which
was

for

by
virginia
and

almost
from
the
beginning
there
were
two
political
parties
the
were
made
up
of
those
who
had
been
most
in
favor
of
the
new
constitution
and
desired
to
build
up
a
strong
central
government
accordingly
they
advocated
a
liberal
construction
of
the
constitution
as
regards
the
extent
of
federal
authority
they
cherished
the
traditional
spirit
of
the
english
laws
and
english
political
institutions
and
belonged
to
this
class
and
was
their
most
active
leader
the
of
whom
was
the
chief

for
a
careful
guarding
of
the
rights
of
the
states
and
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
powers
allotted
to
the
general
government
they
had
more
sympathy
with
the
political
ideas
at
that
time
fast
coming
into
vogue
in
france
they
had
a
warm
faith
in
the
capacity
of
the
mass
of
the
people

and
for
suffrage
they
were
called

were
sometimes
styled

a
great
effect
at

and
made
a
strong
impression
favorable

were
opposed
by

of

the
federalists
were
determined
to
maintain
a
strict
neutrality
in
the
conflict
between
france
and

as
the
revolution
proceeded
a
strong
antipathy
was
awakened
in
america
to
the
radical
theories
as
well
as
to
the
bloody

this
was

the
contest
of

reached
its
climax
in
connection
with
jay
treaty
with
great
britain
a
treaty
negotiated
by
chief
justice
whom
had
sent
as
envoy
to
london
there
were
mutual
grounds
of
complaint
between
the
two
countries
the
british
had
not
surrendered
the
western
military
posts
and
were
in
the
habit
of
impressing
seamen
last
practice
was
founded
on
the
claim
that
a
british
subject
can
never
become
the
subject
of
another
country
and
that
moreover
his
military
service
may
be
always
called
for
by
his
sovereign
when
almost
all
europe
was
at
war
the
carrying
trade
naturally
fell
to
a
large
extent
into
american
hands
hence
it
was
alleged
many
english
sailors
deserted
to
get
employment
in

ships
the
british
claimed
and
exercised
the
right
to
visit
foreign
vessels
and
to
take
from
their
decks
the
sailors
who
were
asserted
to
be
british
subjects
the
english
on
their
part
complained
that
the
treaty
stipulations
as
to
debts
due
in
america
to
british
subjects
had
not
been
observed
jay

provided
for
the
of

western
posts
according
to
the
previous
stipulation
but
said
nothing
respecting
the
right
of
impressment
which
the
british
at
that
time
would
never
have
consented
to
relinquish
it
was
alleged
also
that
in
other
features
the
treaty
favored
england
unwarrantably
and
unfairly
in
relation
to
france
it
encountered
violent
opposition
from
the
republicans
but
it
was
approved
by
and
the
legislative
measures
for
carrying
it
out
were
passed
in

the
obnoxious

of
the
preceding

disappeared
with
it
one
of
the
most
important
events
under

was
the
purchase
of
from
france
which
had
acquired
it
from
spain
knew
that
he
could
not
keep
it
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
england
and
readily
sold
it
for
fifteen
millions
of
dollars
thereby
the
territory
of
the
united
states
was
doubled
in
its
extent
the
whole
region
between
the
mississippi
and
the
rocky
mountains
with

was
added
to
the

with
whatever

the

composed
of
the
portion
of
the
northwest
territory
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
in
the
first
fifteen
years
after
the
government
was
organized
there
are
four
things
that
affected
powerfully
the
character
and
career
of
the
united
states
the
first
was
the
influence
of
in
inspiring
attachment
to
the
union
the
second
was
the
genius
of
in
creating
an
efficient
administration
of
the
new
civil
polity
the
third
was
the
democratic
political
tendency
fostered
by
the
fourth
was
the
vast
expansion
of
the
national
territory
by
the
louisiana
purchase
insuring
the
extension
of
the
and
preventing
the
rise
of
rival
political
communities
in
its
neighborhood
war
with
the
the
pirates
of
and
the
other
barbary
states
demanded
tribute
of
american
vessels
on
the
mediterranean
the
first
exploits
of
the
navy
of
the
united
states
were
in
combats
with
these
marauders
performed
the
exploit
of
burning
in
the
harbor
of
the
american
ship
which
the
tripolitans
had
captured
was
captured
and
bombarded
finally
a
treaty
put
an
end
to
the
exaction
of
tribute
an
event
that
deeply
moved
the
whole
country
was
the
killing
of
by
in
a
duel
was
afterwards
charged
with
an
intention
to
form
a
new
government
on
the
borders
of
the
united
states
he
was
tried
for
treason
and
not
convicted
although
many
have
believed
him
to
be
guilty
causes
of
the
war
of
the
great
european
wars
brought
the
united
states
into
serious
difficulties
principally
in
regard
to
questions
relating
to
commerce
attempts
were
made
by
the
european
nations
to
establish
blockades
by
mere
enactment
without
actual
and
sufficient
occupation
of
the
ports
which
were
declared
to
be
closed
the
tendency
of
the
british
in
and
of
napoleon
and
was
to
grind
to
pieces
the
few
remaining
neutral
powers
these
were
in
effect
cut
off
from
trade
with
both
continental
and
english
ports
by
the
ordinances
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
belligerents
the
penalty
being
the
confiscation
of
the
vessels
employed
in
such
traffic
such
were
the
restrictions
upon
neutrals
that
a
great
number
of
american
ships
were
seized
and
confiscated
by
english
and
french
cruisers
in
addition
to
these
grievances
the
a
british
ship
exercised
the
pretended
right
of
impressment
by
firing
on
an
american
and
in
like
manner
another
british
vessel
the
fired
on
the
frigate
chesapeake
which
was
not
prepared
for
resistance
and
took
four
men
from
its
crew
june
in
retaliation
ordered
all
british
ships
of
war
to
leave
the
coast
of
the
united
states
then
followed
the
embracing
a
succession
of
enactments
of
congress
which
forbade
american
vessels
to
leave
the
harbors
of
the
united
states
for
europe
and
forbade
european
vessels
to
land
cargoes
in
american
ports
the
result
of
this
measure
was
to
smite
american
commerce
with
an
utter
paralysis
the
ships
rotted
at
the
wharves
the
unpopularity
of
the
embargo
especially
in
the
eastern
commercial
states
was
such
that
in
second
term
it
was
repealed
it
was
followed
by
the
prohibiting
commerce
with
france
and
england
the
british
in
were
then
in
a
measure
relaxed
as
was
the
practical
enforcement
against
our
vessels
of
the
in
the
french
rescinded
their
obnoxious
decrees
and
the
english
immediately
took
the
same
step
but
not
soon
enough
to
prevent
a
war
with
the
united
states
events
of
the
war
in
and
a
wise
and
moderate
statesman
of
the
republican
party
became
president
in
he
was
personally
averse
to
engaging
in
war
with
great
britain
but
the
exasperation
of
a
large
part
of
the
country
and
the
pressure
of
the
younger
leaders
of
his
party
and
moved
him
to
a
reluctant
consent
the
war
which
was
declared
in
was
bitterly
opposed
in
the
states
where
the
strength
of
the
federalists
chiefly
lay
by
them
the
real
motive
of
it
was
considered
to
be
partiality
for
france
the
treasury
was
nearly
empty
there
were
but
few
ships
of

and
only

small

the
news
had
not
reached
this
country
the
hartford
the
antagonism
to
the
war
in
the
new
england
states
found
expression
in
the
call
of
a
at
where
their
delegates
met
these
states
complained
that
while
their
commerce
and
fisheries
were
ruined
there
was
no
protection
afforded
to
their
in
connecticut
had
been
bombarded
and
in
maine
had
been
captured
they
denied
also
that
the
general
government
had
the
power
over
the
state
militia
which
it
claimed
for
these
and
other
grievances
they
sought
for
a
remedy
not
repugnant
to
their
obligations
as
members
of
the
union
they
declared
that
measures
of
the
general
government
which
are
palpable
violations
of
the
constitution
are
void
and
that
the
states
injuriously
affected
might
severally
protect
their
citizens
from
the
operation
of
them
by
such
means
as
the
several
states
should
judge
it
wise
to
adopt
but
they
disavowed
the
right
or
intent
to
break
up
the
union
the
effect
of
the
convention
was
to
bring
great
popular
discredit
on
the
federalists
and
to
seal
their
doom
as
a
distinct
party
treaty
of
peace
in
the
of
provisions
were
made
for
defining
boundaries
as
settled
by
previous
treaties
and
an
engagement
was
made
on
both
sides
to
suppress
the
but
no
mention
was
made
of
maritime
rights
and
the
impressment
of
seamen
this
last
practice
was
however
discontinued
although
it
was
never
renounced
the
war
left
the
disputes
that
caused
it
just
where
they
were
many
then
and
since
have
regarded
it
as
really
undertaken
by
the
dominant
party
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
help
one
of
the
belligerents
in
the
great
struggle
then
going
forward
between
england
and
france
whether
this
view
be
just
or
not
it
is
certain
that
the
war
imparted
to
americans
the
consciousness
of
power
and
nationality
the
connection
between
america
and
great
britain
was
broken
off
at
the
revolution
because
as
once
said
colonies
are
like
fruits
which
only
stay
on
the
tree
until
they
are
ripe
but
the
conflict
was
not
over
at
the
conclusion
of
the
peace
of
has
called
the
war
of
the
second
war
of
independence
nothing
lent
it
this
character
so
much
as
the
naval

unity
were
objects
of
earnest
desire
william
the

promised
his
people
a
constitution
but
the
two
emperors
of
austria
and
of
russia
together
with
had
at
the
instigation
of
whose
mind
was
tinged
with
religious
mysticism
formed
at
paris
the
holy
alliance
a
covenant
in
which
they
pledged
themselves
in
dealing
with
their
subjects
and
in
their
international
relations
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
christian
justice
and
charity
they
invited
all
the
potentates
of
europe
except
the
sultan
and
the
pope
to
become
parties
to
this
sacred
compact
with
the
exception
of
the
prince
regent
of
england
the
sovereigns
complied
with
the
request
this
alliance
which
was
sincerely
meant
by

popularly
confused
with
the
alliance
of
russia

the
aim
of
which
was
to
prevent
further
revolutions

averse

freedom
and
constitutional

his
counsels
for
a
whole
generation
was
not
a
profound
statesman
but
an
expert
diplomatist
who
labored
generally
with
success
to
stifle
every
effort
for
an
increase
of
freedom
in
germany
and
elsewhere
on
the
continent
in
the
smaller
german
states
especially
those
which
had
belonged
to
the

there
was
a
disposition
to
found
a
constitutional
system
but
the
prussian
government
followed
in
the
wake
of
austria
and
austria
stood
in
the
way
of
every
such
innovation
agitation
and
the
agitation
for
liberty
was
specially
rife
among
the
students
in
the
german
universities
a
demonstration
by
them
at
the
in
commemoration
of

of
the
victory
over

there
were
songs
and
speeches

a
burning
of
books
was
noticed
by
the
prussian
and
austrian
ministers
and
the
alleged
revolutionary
movements
of
students
were
denounced
by
the
emperor
this
reactionary
zeal
was
whetted
by
the
murder
of
a
german
poet
who
was
hated
as
a
tool
of
russia
and
a
foe
of
liberty
and
was
assassinated

fanatical
prussian
student

executed
for
the
deed

his
fate
drew
out
many
expressions
of
pity
and
sympathy
the

of

adopted
what
were
called
carlsbad
which
provided
for
a
more
rigid
censorship
of
the

committees
of
investigation
to
suppress
revolutionary
agitation
and
a
strict
supervision
of
the

by
the

all
the
states
were
required
to
enforce
these
regulations
the
liberal
party
the
party
of

still
subsisted

in

some

the

very
much
to

one
hand
were
the
legitimists
aiming
at
the
restoration
of
the
elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
on
the
other
hand
there
were
the
republicans
who
wished
to
be
rid
of
monarchy
altogether
the
government
of
satisfied
neither
it
served
as
a
transition
or
temporary
in
the
progress
of
france
towards
the
goal
of
rational
and
stable
republicanism
to
which
the
great
revolution
tended
it
was
an
attempt
to
put
new
wine
in
old
bottles
this
inherent
weakness
of
the
orleans
rule
it
would
have
been
difficult
by
any
means
to
neutralize
in
such
a
way
as
to
avert
sooner
or
later
a
catastrophe
the
unbending
conservatism
of
as
seen
for
instance
in
his
refusal
to
extend
suffrage
hastened
this
result
a
government
over
which
less
than
half
a
million
of
voters
of
the
middle
class
alone
had
an
influence
could
not
stand
against
the
progressive
feeling
of
the
country
the
middle
class
on
which
the
throne
depended
became
separated
from
the
advanced
party
to
which
the
youth
of
france
more
and
more
rallied
was
personally
upright
but
official
corruption
was
suffered
to
spread
in
the
last
years
of
his
administration
and
bribery
was
used
in
the
elections
these
circumstances
added
to
the
mortification
of
national
pride
from
the
little
heed
paid
to
france
by
the
other
powers
weakened
the
throne
the
failure
of
the
government
to
support
the
cause
of
liberty
in
and
was
another
important
source
of
its
growing
unpopularity
in
the
personal
written
by
him
after
the
fall
of

defended
himself
against
the
charge
of
a
want
of
loyal
support
of
the
head
of
the
ministry
while
he
guizot
was
ambassador
to
england
there
was
a
private
understanding
that
he
should
go
no
farther
than
his
sympathy
with
the
views
of
extended
has
undertaken
also
to
show
that
a
war
in
behalf
of
would
have
been
most
unwise
and
that
it
was
for
the
interest
of
france
to
regain
its
weight
in
european
affairs
not
by
the
renewal
of
the
bloody
and
fruitless
contests
of
the
past
but
by
methods
of
peace
he
deemed
it
his
duty
not
to
give
way
to
the
warlike
tastes
and
inclinations
of
the
french
people
the
effort
however
to
tie
down
so
spirited
a
nation
to
so
tame
a
policy
proved
to
be
futile
the
recollections
of
the
empire
which
the
government
itself
did
so
much
to
arouse
moved
the
people
to
compare
the
achievements
of
the
past
with
the
humiliating
position
of
their
country
under
the
orleans
rule
guizot
has
left
this
interesting
exposition
of
his
principles
and
policy
in
the
diplomatic
complication
which
agitated
europe
i
saw
a
brilliant
opportunity
of
exercising
and
loudly
proclaiming
a
foreign
policy
extremely
new
and
bold
in
fact
though
moderate
in
appearance
the
only
foreign
policy
which
in
suited
the
peculiar
position
of
france
and
her
government
as
also
the
only
course
in
harmony
with
the
guiding
principles
and
permanent
wants
of
the
great
scheme
of
civilization
to
which
the
world
of
aspires
and
tends
the
spirit
of
conquest
of
propagandism
and
of
system
has
hitherto
been
the
moving
cause
and
master
of
the
foreign
policy
of
states
the
ambition
of
princes
or
peoples
has
sought
its
gratification
in
territorial
aggrandizement
religious
or
political
faith
has
endeavored
to
expand
by
imposing
itself
great
heads
of
government
have
attempted
to
regulate
the
destinies
of
nations
according
to
profound
combinations
the
offspring
rather
of
their
own
thought
than
the
natural
result
of
facts
let
us
cast
a
glance
over
the
history
of
international
european
relations
we
shall
see
the
spirit
of
conquest
or
of
armed
propagandism
or
of
some
systematic
design
upon
the
territorial
organization
of
europe
inspire
and
determine
the
foreign
policy
of
governments
let
one
or
other
of
these
impulses
prevail
and
governments
have
disposed
arbitrarily
of
the
fate
of
nations
war
has
ever
been
their
indispensable
mode
of
action
i
know
that
this
course
of
things
has
been
the
fatal
result
of
passions
and
that
in
spite
of
those
passions
and
the
evils
they
have
inflicted
on
nations
european
civilization
has
continued
to
increase
and
prosper
and
may
increase
and
prosper
still
more
it
is
to
the
honor
of
the
christian
world
that
evil
does
not
stifle
good
i
know
that
the
progress
of
civilization
and
public
reason
will
not
abolish
human
passions
and
that
under
their
impulse
the
spirit
of
conquest
of
armed
propagandism
and
of
system
will
ever
maintain
in
the
foreign
policy
of
states
their
place
and
portion
but
at
the
same
time
i
hold
for
certain
that
these
various
incentives
are
no
longer
in
harmony
with
the
existing
state
of
manners
ideas
interests
and
social
instincts
and
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
combat
and
restrain
materially
their
empire
the
extent
and
activity
of
industry
and
commerce
the
necessity
of
consulting
the
general
good
the
habit
of
frequent
easy
prompt
and
regular
intercourse
between
peoples
the
invincible
bias
for
free
association
inquiry
discussion
and
publicity
these
characteristic
features
of
great
modern
society
already
exercise
and
will
continue
to
exercise
more
and
more
against
the
warlike
or
diplomatic
fancies
of
foreign
policy
a
preponderating
influence
people
smile
not
without
reason
at
the
language
and
puerile
confidence
of
the
of
and
of
the
all
the
leading
tendencies
all
the
most
elevated
hopes
of
humanity
have
their
dreams
and
their
idle
gaping
advocates
as
they
have
also
their
days
of
decline
and
defeat
but
they
no
less
pursue
their
course
and
through
all
the
chimeras
of
some
the
doubts
and
mockeries
of
others
society
becomes
transformed
and
policy
foreign
and
domestic
is
compelled
to
transform
itself
with
society
we
have
witnessed
the
most
dazzling
exploits
of
the
spirit
of
conquest
the
most
impassioned
efforts
of
the
spirit
of
armed
propagandism
we
have
seen
territories
and
states
molded
and
unmade
and
unmade
again
at
the
pleasure
of
combinations
more
or
less
specious
what
survives
of
all
these
violent
and
arbitrary
works
they
have
fallen
like
plants
without
roots
or
edifices
without
foundation
and
now
when
analogous
enterprises
are
attempted
scarcely
have
they
made
a
few
steps
in
advance
when
they
pause
and
hesitate
as
if
embarrassed
by
and
doubtful
of
themselves
so
little
are
they
in
accord
with
the
real
wants
the
profound
instincts
of
existing
society
and
with
the
persevering
though
frequently
disputed
tendencies
of
modern
civilization
i
repeat
our
history
since
our
endless
succession
of
shocks
revolutions
and
wars
have
left
us
in
a
state
of
leverish
agitation
which
renders
peace
insipid
and
teaches
us
to
find
a
blind
gratification
in
the
unexpected
strokes
of
a
hazardous
policy
we
are
a
prey
to
two
opposing
currents
one
deep
and
regular
which
carries
towards
the
definite
goal
of
our
social
state
the
other
superficial
and
disturbed
which
throws
us
here
and
there
in
search
of
new
adventures
and
unknown
lands
thus
we
float
and
alternate
between
these
two
opposing
directions
called
towards
the
one
by
our
sound
sense
and
moral
conviction
and
enticed
towards
the
other
by
our
habits
of
routine
and
freaks
of
imagination
of
a
minister
of
state
from
the
year
pp
the
king
the
imputation
of
avarice
to
louis
philippe
was
one
source
of
his
increasing
unpopularity
on
his
accession
he
had
handed
over
to
his
children
the
estates
of
the
house
of
orleans
in
order
that
as
private
property
they
might
not
be
forfeited
with
the
loss
of
the
crown
he
was
not
content
with
increasing
his
wealth
by
adding
to
it
all
the
possessions
of
and
of
the
of
but
it
was
discovered
that
he
was
engaged
in
business
ventures
in
providing
for
ample
marriage
settlements
for
his
children
he
resorted
to
devices
which
gave
offense
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
to
the
public
yet
writers
like
who
are
strongly
averse
to
his
method
of
rule
clear
him
of
blame
in
these
particulars
if
he
is
to
be
judged
by
what
is
usual
in
a
monarchical
system
the
spanish
an
event
of
consequence
in
relation
to
the
fall
of
louis
philippe
from
power
was
the
affair
of
the
spanish
marriages
which
took
place
under
the
ministry
of
guizot
the
de
the
youngest
son
of
the
king
was
married
to
the
sister
of
of
spain
the
design
it
was
believed
was
in
the
anticipated
childlessness
of
the
queen
to
secure
for
his
heirs
the
spanish
crown
of
spain
was
an
absolutist
but
the
extreme
monarchical
party
there
wished
for
a
king
of
more
energy
and
desired
to
raise
to
the
throne
his
brother
in
being
then
childless
was
induced
by
his
wife
the
daughter
of
of
naples
to
abrogate
the
salic
law
excluding
females
from

daughter

successful
and

herself
with

progressive
party

prosperity

were
against

result
of
a

chief
of
the
cabinet

was
dismissed

of

liberal
features

at
the

time
a
marriage
of
his
son

with
her
sister
an

prince
would
not
have
acquired
the
crown
even
if
louis

throne

was
born
to
isabella

was
loud
complaint
in
england
against
the
king
and
for
the
alleged
violation
of
a
promise
in
this
affair
their
defense
was
that
who
succeeded
took
a
very
different
position
from
that
of

had
been
the
condition
of
the
engagement

was
from

previously
in

the
french
were
embittered

after

the

taken
to

he
went

were
incensed
with
this
was
one
inducement
that
moved
him
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
by
which
france
engaged
to
withdraw
her
troops
gradually
from
rome
leaving
the
pope
to
form
an
army
of
his
own
while
on
the
other
hand
the
king
engaged
to
prevent
any
attack
on
the
papal
territory
the
french
minister
of
foreign
affairs
said
to
the
italian
minister
at
paris
naturally
the
result
of
all
this
will
be
that
you
will
end
by
going
to
rome
but
matters
were
to
be
so
managed
that
france
should
not
be
held
responsible
this
was
the
was
made
the
capital
of
italy
but
it
was
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
temporary
arrangement
and
that
as
soon
as
the
progress
of
events
should
open
the
way
the
seat
of
government
would
be
transferred
to
rome
after
the
withdrawal
of

french
troops
in

the
connivance
of

more

a
force
for
the
capture
of
rome
but
france
interfered
and
the
advance
of
garibaldi
was
checked
at
by
french
troops
afterwards
again
placed
a
french
garrison
in
rome
whose
scheme
of
capturing
rome
by
was
balked
had
to
lay
down
his
office
the
next
step
towards
italian
unity
was
to
be
a
result
of
the
war
chapter
iv
europe
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
the
end
of
the
war
rivalship
of
prussia
and
the
brief
but
mighty
struggle
which
secured
for
prussia
the
preponderance
in
germany
grew
immediately
out
of
complications
respecting
it
was
however
the
fruit
of
a
rivalship
which
had
been
gaining
in
intensity
since
the
times
of
frederick
the
great
it
was
the
grand
triumph
of
prussia
after
a
long
succession
of
defeats
and
humiliations
in
the
field
of
diplomacy
the
two
duchies
of

had
long
been
annexed
to
the
crown
of
denmark
whose
king
as
duke
of
holstein
was
a
member
of
the
german
confederation
the
two
duchies
as
regards
their
government
did
not
stand
on
the
same
footing
but
the
people
of
and
the
german
portion
of
the
people
held
that
by
a
treaty
in
the
two
duchies
could
not
be
separated
moreover
the
law
of
succession
in
the
duchies
excluded
the
female
line
and
when
there
was
a
prospect
that
the
male
line
of
the
danish
dynasty
would
die
out
the
germans
wished
the
duchies
to
become
independent
under
an
augustenburg
prince

to
absorb

against

troops
of
the
german
confederation
assisted
them
but
the
attitude
of
england
and
russia
which
favored
the
danes
moved
prussia
to
conclude
the
armistice
of
an
act
that
excited
the
anger
of
the
german
national
assembly
at
frankfort
after
the
expiration
of
the
truce
the
war
with
intermissions
went
on
waged
by
alone
or
with
aid
from
germany

in
a
protocol
an
agreement
signed
in

by
the
great
powers
in
which
austria
and
prussia
concurred
the
king
of
denmark
and
his
heirs
were
guaranteed
in
the
possession
of
the
duchies
this
act
however
was
not
accepted
by
the
duchies
themselves
or
by
the
diet
of
the
german
confederation
so
that
the
seeds
of
strife
still
remained
preponderance
of

the
suppression
of
the
revolts
of
austria
whose
counsels
were
guided
by
the
astute
minister

to
dwarf
and
supplant
the
influence
of
prussia

of
prussia
aimed
to
bring
about
a
closer
union
of
german
states
and
called
a
national
parliament
to
meet
at
austria
withstood
these
attempts
the
disposition
of
prussia
to
support
the
resistance
in
to
the
tyranny
of
its
elector
threatened
to
bring
on
an
armed
contest
with
austria
and
its
german
allies
but
the
attitude
of
russia
caused
prussia
to
desist
from
its
movement
at
the
conference
at
the
prussian
minister
yielded
every
thing
to
austria
and
subsequently
under
the
influence
of
russia
the
german
confederation
of
was
restored
prussia
took
no
part
with
the
western
powers
in
the
crimean
war
with
which
it
had
no
direct
concern
and
thus
did
not

the

policy
in

relations
to

it
refused
to
lend
active
aid
to
that
country
in
the
war
with
france
and
sardinia
the
efficient
measures
of
king
for
the
reorganization
and
increase
of
the
army
encountered
constant
opposition
year
after
year
in
the
assembly
from
the
liberal
party
which
did
not
divine
his
motives
and
saw
in
them
nothing
but
the
usurping
of
an
unconstitutional
authority
in
the
king
made
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
virtual
head
of
the
administration
this
able
man
had
widened
his
knowledge
of
european
politics
by
serving
as
ambassador
first
at
and
then
at
previously
he
had
been
allied
with
the
absolutist
party
of
he
was
always
for
strong
government
after
when
he
was
delegate
of
prussia
at
the
federal
diet
at
he
made
up
his
mind
to
deliver
prussia
from
the
domineering
influence
of
austria
but
he
was
held
in
distrust
by
the
prussian
liberals
who
saw
in
him
only
an
energetic
supporter
of
the
king
in
his
reform
of
the
army
by
acts
of
arbitrary
power
not
warranted
by
the
constitution
in
summoned
a
congress
of
german
princes
to
to
frame
a
new
german
constitution
but
as
prussia
stood
aloof
nothing
was
accomplished
there
was
much
bitterness
between
the
two
states
for
the
moment
however
attention
was
diverted
by
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
events
leading
to
on
march
of
denmark
issued
a
decree
for
the
separation
of
and
its
incorporation
in
denmark
the
troops
of
the
german
confederacy
were
sent
by
the
diet
into
prussia
and
austria
who
held
that
the
danes
had
broken
the
treaty
of
announced
their
agreement
to
prosecute
the
war
with
denmark
as
independent
powers
apart
from
the
confederation
they
persisted
in
this
purpose
and
their
victories
over
the
danes
compelled
to
sign
a
treaty
by
which
he
resigned
his
rights
in
the
duchies
in
favor
of
the
emperor
of
austria
and
the
king
of
prussia
how
should
the
duchies
be
disposed
of
it
was
aim
to
annex
them
to
prussia
which
was
sorely
in
need
of
seaports
he
professed
that
the
war
had
abrogated
the
london
treaty
of
the
prime
object
of
austria
was
to
prevent
prussia
from
making
this
gain
the
dispute
was
hot
and
threatening
but
in
the
which
the
danes
had
also
ceded
was
sold
to
prussia
and
the
disposition
of
the
duchies
was
left
to
be
determined
later
meantime
the
prussians
were
to
hold
and
the
austrians
the
prussians
were
moreover
to
hold
provisionally
the
port
of
the
scheme
of
austria

to

over
the
debated
question
to
the
diet
of
the
confederation
where
it
could
command
a
majority
to
this
prussia
would
not
consent
but
demanded
that
the
confederacy
should
be
reconstituted
in
such
a
that
prussia
as
well
as
germany
might
have
strength
in
the
event
of
a
european
war
made
a
secret
treaty
with
sardinia
which
provided
that
prussia
and
sardinia
should
act
together
in
case
of
war
with
austria
and
that
peace
should
not
be
made
until
had
been
given
up
to
the

convoked
the
estates

of
a

with

for
a
decade
of
years
out
of
this
party
came
later
the
terrorists
the
secret
body
which
sought
for
a
remedy
for
social
and
governmental
evils
by
annihilating
all
existing
authority
in
church
and
state
they
had
begun
with

demand
of
a
constitution
the
despotic
repressive
measures
of
the
government
in
and
sixty
thousand
persons
were
sent
to
without
a
trial
were
followed
by
more
desperate
attempts
of
nihilist
conspirators
upon
the
lives
of
the
rulers
of
the

and
of

agents

that
it

desirable
to

a
community
of
goods
and
a
total
or
partial
abolition
of
private
property
is
often
used
to
designate
the

system
but
is
more
commonly
applied
to
the
doctrine
that
government
should
own
the

all
the
implements
of
industry
not
a

long
existed
the
hope
of
social
amelioration
by
societies
of

of

for
the

them
on
both
sides
of

atlantic
equality
education
deliverance
from

one
noted
expounder
of

in

doctrine

affirming
that

is
theft
who
was
a
member
of
the

government
in

before

after
that
time
was
an
active
promoter
of
the
scheme

to

large
scale
and
to
become
the
grand
employer

socialism
in
its
later
distinctive
form
as
defined
above
has
been
advocated
by
a
number
of
writers
perhaps
the
ablest
of
these
was
like
the
other
principal
socialists
he
would
clothe
the

with
a
vastly
augmented
power
and
responsibility
in
this
particular
socialism
is
directly
antagonistic
to
the
ideas
of
democracy
which
had
previously
prevailed
doctrine
was
that
the
state
should
lend
capital
at
interest
to
associations
of
laborers
this
he
thought
would
be
the
first
step
in
their
emancipation
would
go
much
farther
he
would
transfer
to
the
state
all
capital
and
all
means
of
production
he
would
as
he
professes
overthrow
all
the
existing
arrangements
of

to

abolished
labor

destructive
schemes

the
society

up

shades

this
was
effected
by
a
combination
of

very
conservative

the
monarchists
united
to
restore
the

the
scheme
failed
in
february
a
new
constitution

conservative
republican
cast

established
which
provided

a
cabinet
a
senate
and
a
chamber

legitimists
orleanists

imperialists
united
with

his
reactionary
policy
the
whole
clerical
party
were
on
that

a

of

great
subjects

controversy
related

the

to
retain

a
main
aim

a
manifesto
of

after
the
death
of

aroused
an
agitation
against
all
pretenders
to

in

against

which
led
after

to

the
opposition

short
time
he
laid

this

before
the

of

this
law
was
afterwards
construed
to
include
other
orders
the
falk
laws
continued
the
laws
proposed
by
the
prussian
minister
of
worship
required
that
candidates
for
the
clerical
office
in
the
catholic
church
should
have
a
training
in
the
gymnasium
and
university
and
that
every
ecclesiastical
appointment
should
be
sanctioned
by
the
civil
authorities
they
provided
for
a

court
for
the
settlement
of
ecclesiastical
questions
these
laws
were
passed
in

civil

was
made
obligatory
in
the

these
measures
were
stoutly
resisted
by
the
center
or
the
clerical
party
in
the
prussian
parliament
and
in
the
they
were
declared
by
the
pope
to

obey
the
laws
of
the
state
were
adopted
by
prussia
refractory
bishops
and
priests
were
punished
in
various
ways
the
result
was
that
the
roman
catholic
party
led
by
of
hanover
in
opposition
to
measures
was
consolidated
the
struggle
extended
beyond
the
bounds
of
prussia
it
was
a
catholic
state
which
proposed
the
law
requiring
civil
marriage
after
the
accession
of
there
was
on
both
sides
an
increased
disposition
to
find
terms
of
peace
by
which
the
numerous
vacancies
in
catholic
clerical
offices
could
be
filled
the
need
which
felt
of
the
support
of
the
center
for
his
financial
measures
favored
this
result
resigned
july
he
being
personally
odious
to
the
roman
party
after
long
debates
a
bill
was
passed
giving
to
the
king
and
his
ministers
discretionary
powers
which
opened
the
way
for
filling
the
vacant
places
still
in
the
great
festival
at
the
completion
of
the
cologne
cathedral
the
clerical
party
stood
aloof
but
the
mutual
friendly
approaches
of
the
chancelor
and
his
ultramontane
opponents
continued
diplomatic
correspondence
was
opened
with
the
vatican
some
of
the
harsher
features
of
the
legislation
were
revoked
bismarck
and
one
motive
in
this
modification
of
the
chancelor
policy
was
the
rapid
progress
of
socialism
at
first
while
was
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
the
liberals
who
impeded
his
plans
in
the
prussian
parliament
he
had
willingly
availed
himself
of
the
support
of
and
his
socialistic
followers
but
after
the
war
with
france
the
party
of
the
social
democrats
became
more
and
more
numerous
and
formidable
it
was
not
however
until
a
second
attempt
was
made
on
the
emperor
life
that
bismarck
was
able
to
carry
against
the
combination
of
parties
his
measures
giving
to
the
government
extraordinary
powers
for
the
stifling
of
socialistic
agitation
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
socialistic
meetings
newspapers
was
rigorously
enforced
the
particularists
bismarck
was
moreover
obliged
to
contend
with
the
particularists
who
were
hostile
to
the
empire
and
with
a
large
number
besides
them
who
were
opposed
to
a
greater
degree
of
imperial
centralization
at
the
expense
of
the
power
of
the
separate
states
unable
to
obtain
for
the
imperial
government
the
control
over
the
german
railroad
system
he
devised
a
plan
by
which
prussia
would
eventually
control
of
the
railroads
of
germany
an
imperial
code
of
laws
was
adopted
but
from
jealousy
of
prussia
the
seat
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeal
was
fixed
at
in
his
economical
and
financial
measures
the
chancelor
was
often
charged
with
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
free
representative
government
according
to
the
english
system
did
not
accord
with
his
idea
of
the
prussian
monarchy
and
with
the
character
of
the
new
empire
the
unity
of
which
he
was
naturally
anxious
to
fortify
by
his
alliance
with
austria
in
he
placed
germany
in
a
situation
to
resist
russia
and
france
in

aggrieved
by

with

after
another
until
the

came
to
be
acknowledged
as
far
north
as

the
english
advance
was
made
with
the
help
of
native
auxiliaries
and
could
not
have
been
made
without
it
it
was
quite
as
much
an
internal
revolution
as
a
foreign
conquest
as
the
british
enlarged
their
dominion
and
came
into
conflict
with
the
french
the
appetite
for
supremacy
grew
under
the
rule
of
the
of
partly
through
the
victories
of
arthur
afterwards
the

the
policy
of

pursued
with
brilliant
success
the

the
effort
always
was
to
secure

with

in
its
absorption
in
british
territory
in
the
annexation
of
followed
a
british
protectorate
having
been
found
insufficient
the
misgovernment
of
the
native
princes
in
led
to
the
assumption
of
the
government
of
that
province
by
the
english
in
the
indian
there
was
hostility
to
british
rule
among
the
mohammedans
in
india
and
distrust
among
the
hindoos
the
latter
acquired
a
fanatical
belief
that
the
english
who
had
abolished
the
burning
of
widows
and
even
legalized
their
marriage
meant
to
force
the
people
to
lose
caste
by
driving
them
to
sacrilegious
practices
the
report
that

had
been
served
out
which
had
been
lubricated
with
the
fat
of
the

abhorred
by
moslems
and
of
the

venerated
by
the
hindoos
stirred
up
a
revolt
among
the
native
sepoy
troops
the
insurrection
spread
and
was
attended
with
savage
cruelties
there
was
a
frightful
massacre
of
women
and
children
at
before
general
could
arrive
for
its
relief
the
english
who
were
besieged
in
after
terrible
suffering
were
relieved
by
the
opportune
coming
of
this
gallant
soldier
all
the
english
residents
in
who
could
not
escape
into
the
jungle
were
murdered
the
weak
old

himself
at

recaptured
by
the
british
and
the
conquest
completed
by
colin
march

subdued
gradually
the
rebellion
was
crushed
and
merciless
severity
was
exercised
by
the
conquerors
upon
those
most
actively
concerned
in
it
one
consequence
of
the
revolt
was
the
entire
transference
of
the
government
of
india
from
the
east

to

the

russia
and
the
gradual
approaches
of

in
the
direction
of
have
been
on
two
lines
the
one
is
the
line
from
the
caspian
she
gained
a
lodgment
in
at
on
the
eastern
shore
of
that
sea
in
and
were
taken
the
other
line
of
aggressive
approach
is
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
oxus
on
this
line
partly
from
displeasure
at
the
english
occupation
of
egypt
and
in
pursuance
of
the
policy
adopted
especially
since
the
berlin
conference
to
advance
towards
the
russians
suddenly
seized
an
oasis
extremely
important
from
a
military
point
of
view
over
which
claimed
a
certain
suzerainty
the
russians
occupied
it
in
force
under
march
subsequently
england
and
russia
agreed
to
ascertain
and
fix
the
northern
boundary
of
afghanistan
the
occupation
of
by
the
afghans
followed
by
the
advance
of
of
which
the
british
complained
as
an
aggression
brought
the
two
countries
to
the
verge
of
war
the
western
powers
and
the
oriental
question
the
question
relating
to
turkey
and
its
dependencies
constantly
took
on
new
phases
and
presented
to
the
powers
of
europe
fresh
difficulties
and
dangers
of
conflict
the
khedive
of
egypt
was
a
friend
and
admirer
of
and
of
the
french
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
sultan
repeated
concessions
which
reduced
his
dependence
on
turkey
to
little
more
than
an
obligation
to
pay
an
annual
tribute
together
with
certain
marks
of
respect
and
honor
his
conflicts
with
lands
on
the
south
and
his
extravagant
outlays
in
public
works
of
internal
improvement
and
the
enormous
interest
paid
to
foreign
capitalists
for
their
loans
involved
him
in
the
utmost
financial
embarrassment
this
furnished
the
occasion
to
the
western
powers
in
particular
to
england
and
france
to
intermeddle
still
more
in
egyptian
affairs
the
khedive
sold
to
the
british
government
his
shares
in
the
and
gave
into
the
hands
of
the
english
and
french
the
control
of
the
financial
administration
of
the
country
this
sort
of
dependence
was
repugnant
to
both
the
khedive
and
the
egyptian
people
the
native
officers
were
pushed
into
the
background
the
most
lucrative
stations
were
filled
by
foreigners
and
the
weight
of
taxation
was
almost
intolerable
the
attempt
to
throw
off
this
yoke
only
resulted
in
the
deposition
of
by
the
sultan
on
the
demand
of
the
two
western
powers
his
weak
son
took
his
place
the
control
of
the
finances
remained
in
foreign
hands
the
result
of
the
discontent
of
the
people
and
of
the
disaffection
of
the
egyptian
officers
was
a
revolt
led
by
a
military
officer
the
khedive
complied
with
the
demands
of
the
insurgents
their
chief
was
made
minister
of
war
the
western
powers
were
bent
on
suppressing
this
movement
and
in
addition
to
threats
and
diplomatic
measures
sent
their
fleets
to
egypt
a
revolt
broke
out
in
in
which
the
english
consul
was
wounded
and
many
europeans
were
slain
june
the
city
was
filled
with
terror
and
all
trade
was
suspended
the
english
fleet
bombarded
the
city
and
set
it
on
fire
withdrew
his
troops
to
he
was
now
deposed
by
the
khedive
and
declared
a
rebel
his
troops
showed
little
spirit
the
fortifications
of
were
taken
by
the
english
general
sir
almost
without
resistance
and
surrendered
and
the
egyptian
leader
was
captured
and
banished
from
that
time
egypt
fell
into
a
condition
of
helpless
dependence
on
england
france
found
herself
without
the
influence
there
which
she
had
always
coveted
since
the
days
of
the
first
the
system
of
administration
in
egypt
was
now
organized
by
the
english
through

complaint
was
made
against
them
by
the
other
powers
for
not
taking
sufficient
precautions
to
prevent
the
introduction
of

cholera
from

hatred

bitterly
of
the
oppressive
egyptian
officers

were
exasperated
at
the
prohibition
of

england
had
insisted
in
the
course
of
the
conflict
with
an
english
officer

the
service
of
the
khedive
was
defeated
and
slain
and
his
force
cut
to
pieces
near

there
was
great
fear
now
for
the
province
of

especially
for
the
city
of
where
there
were
many
europeans

the
english
ministry
of

not
disposed
to

desired
to
give
it
up
as
soon
as

policy
the
khedive

the
extraordinary
measure

was
slain
the
course
of
england
respecting

had
left
her
isolated
as

the
other
european

and
had
awakened
much
disaffection
in

it
was
the
policy
of

in
relation
to

even
more
than
complaints
growing
out
of

of

and
their
antipathy
to

broke
out
in
different
forms
as
circumstances
changed
for
a
long
time
the
demand
was
for
catholic
emancipation
this
was
granted
but
most
of
the
english
concessions
were
made
under
such
a
pressure
and
in
appearance
so
grudgingly
that
little
was
accomplished
by
them
in
placating
irish
hostility
the
outcry

of

to
a
great
extent
quieted

the

the
irish
protestant
church
carried
by
in
and
put
in
execution
in
took
away
one
of
the
great
grievances
of
which
the
irish
nation
had
to
complain
the
repeal
of
the
legislative
union
of
england
and
ireland
was
the
watchword
of
and
his
followers
in
one
form
or
another
the
demand
for
local
or
independence
which
has
been
more
lately
urged
under
the
name
of
home
rule
has
been
kept
up
with
little
intermission
it
is
about
the
special
question
of
land
reform
that
the
most
bitter
conflicts
have
centered
the
ownership
of
a
great
part
of
the
land
in
ireland
by
a
few
persons
the
fact
that
great
obstacles
and
great
expenses
difficulties
of
late
somewhat
lightened
have
existed
in
the
way
of
the
transference
of
land
if
any
one
had
the
means
to
purchase
it
the
circumstances
that
the
owners
have
generally
been
not
residents
but
absent
landlords
that
in
cases
of
dispute
with
tenants
the
laws
were
for
a
long
period
framed
in
their
interest
that
the
management
of
estates
was
left
to
agents
or
that
multitudes
of
tenants
whose
holdings
were
small
could
glean
a
bare
subsistence
from
the
soil
were
doomed
to
famine
if
the
failed
and
when
unable
to
pay
the
rent
were
liable
to
eviction
that
is
to
be
turned
out
of
doors
with
their
families
to
perish
these
have
been
causes
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
endless
disputes
and
conflicts
add
to
these
facts
the
inbred
hostility
arising
from
differences
of
race
and
religion
the
memory
on
the
part
of
the
irish
of
centuries
of
misgovernment
and
the
feeling
that
the
lands
held
by
sufferance
were
wrested
from
their
ancestors
by
force
and
the
animosity
manifested
in
revolts
and
outrages
is
easily
explained
the
english
government
in
a
series
of
measures
in
connection
with
which
acts
of
coercion
for
preventing
and
punishing
violence
have
been
passed
undertook
to
lessen
the
evils
that
exist
and
to
produce
a
better
state
of
feeling
the
estates
was
established
to
render
more
easy
the
transfer
of
lands
this
act
and
the
passed
the
same
year
although
well
meant
failed
to
improve
the
situation
of
the
tenants
great
measure
of
disestablishment
has
been
referred
to
his
second
great
reform
measure
was
the
land
law
of
the
effect
of
which
was
to
make
the
landlord
pay
damages
to
the
evicted
tenant
to
compensate
him
for
improvements
which
he
had
made
etc
one
object
of
this
act
was
to
create
a
body
of
peasant
proprietors
in
ireland
additional
acts
in

designed
to
assist

to

their
holdings
the

to
the
practical
benefit

disappointed

there
was
a
partial
failure
of

sought
by
obstructing

to
compel

to
withdraw
its
measures
of
coercion
and
to
legislate
in

with
the
views
of
himself
and
his
associates
the
obstructionists
by
joining
the
tories
effected
the
retirement
of
the

cabinet
in

a
system
of
boycotting
was
adopted
for
the
punishment
of

the

an

for

the

stimulus
given

the
prospect
of

less
probable
as

the
fallacious
hope
was
entertained
by
many
that

the
extension
of
slavery
in

been
prevented
by

the

up
the
members
of
congress
from
the
north
and
the
members
from

south
were
in
hostile
array
on
the
point
and
a
dangerous
excitement
was
kindled
by
the
exertions
of
the
missouri
compromise
was
adopted
by
which
the
new
state
was
admitted
with

when

it
was
thought
that

might

that

for

against

president
monroe
in
his
annual
message
in
said
that
we
should
consider
an
attempt
of
the
allied
powers
to
extend
their
system
in
this
country
or
any
interference
on
their
part
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
destiny
of
the
american
states
as
unfriendly
action
towards

this
is
the
monroe
doctrine
an
additional
statement
in
disapproval
of
future
colonization
on

continents
by

powers
was
made
in

message
this
second
statement
was
never
sanctioned
by

it
is
vague
and
was
probably
meant
to
exclude
attempts
to
overthrow
the
liberty
of
the
new
american
republics
the
only
thing
which
the
monroe
doctrine
really
contains
is
the
intimation
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
of
a
right
to
resist
attempts
of
european
powers
to
alter
the
constitutions
of

the
true
origin

intent
of

tariff
its
adversaries
denounced
it
as
unconstitutional
and
his
followers
moreover
contended
that
is
legal
and
admissible
in
other
words
that
a
law
of
congress
may
be
set
aside
by
a
state
within
its
own
limits
provided
it
is
considered
by
that
state
a
gross
infraction
of
the
constitution
there
was
a
memorable
debate
on
this
subject
in
in
the
united
states
senate
when
the
theory
was
advocated
by
of
south
carolina
and
the
opposite
doctrine
defended
by
in
south
carolina
passed
an
ordinance
declaring
that
the
tariff
laws
of
and
were
null
and
void
and
not
binding
in
that
state
president
issued
a
spirited
proclamation
in
which
the
nullification
doctrine
was
repudiated
and
the
opposite
or
national
theory
was
affirmed
and
the
president
resolute
intention
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
united
states
was
announced
the
difficulty
was
ended
by
the
compromise
tariff
introduced
by
providing
for
the
gradual
reduction
of
duties
removal
of
the
the
president
was
hostile
to
the
national
bank
which
he
considered
dangerous
as
liable
to
be
converted
into
a
tool
for
partisan
ends
not
being
able
to
carry
congress
with
him
he
assumed
the
responsibility
after
his
second
election
of
removing
the
deposits
or
public
funds
from
its
custody
or
rather
of
an
order
for
the
cessation
of
these
deposits
for
this
he
was
censured
by
the
senate
a
majority
of
which
regarded
his
act
as
arbitrary
and
unconstitutional
from
about
this
time
the
agitation
respecting
slavery
constantly
increased
in
the
north
a
party
arose
which
through
lectures
and
in
newspapers
and
pamphlets
denounced
slavery
as
iniquitous
and
called
for
immediate
emancipation
the
most
prominent
leader
of
this
party
was
lloyd
and
its
most
captivating
orator
was
this
party
advocated
disunion
on
account
of
the
obligations
imposed
upon
the
north
in
reference
to
slavery
by
the
constitution
they
were
sometimes
assailed
by
mobs
in
northern
cities
the
major
part
of
the
people
in
the
north
desired
some
method
of
extinguishing
slavery
which
should
leave
the
union
intact
meantime
they
were
for
obeying
the
constitution
although
the
obligation
to
restore
fugitive
slaves
was
felt
to
be
obnoxious
and
there
grew
up
a
disposition
to
avoid
compliance
with
it
the
colonizationists
diminished
in
number
there
were
various
types
and
degrees
of
sentiment
the
resolution
to
confine
slavery
by
political
action
within
the
limits
of
the
states
where
it
was
under
the
shield
of
local
law
became
more
and
more
prevalent
in
the
south
on
the
contrary
the
enmity
to
abolitionism
was
intense
and
served
to
increase
the
popularity
of
the
doctrine
of
slavery
came
to
be
defended
as
necessary
under
the
circumstances
and
as
capable
of
justification
on
moral
and
scriptural
grounds
occasions
of
reciprocal
complaint
between
north
and
south
for
illegal
doings
relating
in
one
way

another
to

agency

by
an
act

annexed

the
motive

he
avowed

the
fear
that
it
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
england
and
become
dangerous
to
the
institution

in
the

the
measure
was
strenuously
opposed
in
the
north
as
a
scheme
by
which
it
was
intended
to
strengthen
the
influence
of
the
slaveholding

with

the
wilmot
proviso
the
wilmot
proviso
was
proposed
in
congress
excluding

from
all

to
be
acquired
from

this
demand
for
the
prevention
of
the
further
extension
of
slavery
in
the
territories
subject
to
national
jurisdiction
became
a
on
the
nomination

party

table

motion

but
their
party
lost
a
portion
of
its
adherents
clay
the
application
of
for
admission
to
the
union
which
on
account
of
the
rapid
growth
of
that
community
through
the
discovery
of

was
soon
made

the
sectional
difficulty
to
another
crisis

and
was
succeeded
by
the
the
contest
in

soon
after
adjusted
by
compromise
by
which
was
admitted
as
a
free
state
and
were
organized
into
territories
without
any
mention
of
slavery
the
was
prohibited
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
a
new
law
was
enacted
that
was
framed
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
great
offense
at
the
north
in
a
celebrated
speech
in
favor
of
the
compromise
march
gave
as
a
reason
for
not
insisting
on
the
wilmot
proviso
that
the
physical
character
of
the
new
territories
of
itself
excluded
slavery
from
them
the
kansas
in
during
the
administration
of
the
standing
sectional
controversy

a
new
phase

were
knocking
at
the
doors
of
congress
for
admission
as
states

west
of
missouri
and
like
on
the
north
was
protected
from
slavery
by
the
missouri
compromise
but
the
democrats
carried
through
congress
a
bill
introduced
by
of
illinois
practically
repealing
that
compromise
and
leaving
the
matter
of
the
toleration
of
slavery
to
be
determined
by
the
actual
settlers
as
they
might
see
fit
this
measure
was
extensively
regarded
in
the
north
as
a
breach
of
faith
companies
of
emigrants
were
organized
in
the
northern
states
to
form
permanent
settlements
in

in

to
prevent
that
country
from
becoming

to
attack
them
and
to
harass
the
newly
planted

the

this
time
the
supreme
court
decided
that
neither
negro
slaves
nor
their
descendants
slave
or
free
could
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
added
incidentally
the
dictum
that
the
missouri
compromise
was
unconstitutional
and
that
congress
had
no
right
to
prohibit
the
carrying
of
slaves
into
any
state
or
territory
the
effect
of
this
opinion
if
embodied
in
a
legal
decision
would
have
been
to
prevent
the
exclusion
of
slavery
even
by
a
territorial
legislature
prior
to
the
existence
of

this
judicial
act
following
upon
the
attitude
taken
by
the
government
at
washington
with

an
occurrence
not
without
a
considerable
effect
in
exciting
the
resentment
as
well
as
the
apprehensions
of

the
attempt
of
a
brave
old
man
of
the
puritan
type

enmity
to

had
been
deepened
by

that
the
feeling

dissevered
from

the
difficulty
of
reconstructing

was
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the

of
the
intelligent
people
in
the
seceding
states
were
precluded
or
excluded
themselves
from
taking
part
in
the
measures
requisite
for
this

the
additional
fact
of
the
ignorance
of

of
the
selfish
greed
of
white

contest
with

republican
party
in

was
impeached

tried
by

one
less

the
number
required
on
the
expiration
of

general
was
raised
to
the

office
it
was
complained
that
the
new
governments
instituted
in
the
south
by
the
freedmen
and
their
white
coadjutors
were
grossly
corrupt
and
incapable
and
that
their
returning
boards
made
false
results
of
elections
on
the
other
hand
it
was
complained
that
the
opponents
of
these

resorted
to
violence

to
intimidate

to
keep
them
out

by
the
adverse
party
or
the
class
which
had
contended
against
what
were
derisively
styled

a
difficulty
arose
in
in

of
a
dispute
about
the

deeply
incensed
at
the
usurpation
of

and
were
at

time
hostile
to

a
double

an
attempt

put

to
strip

of

to

to
fire
on
the
ships
of
the
foreign
nations
the
punishment
which
these
inflicted
in
the

impressed
the
emperor
in

with
his
fear
lest

the

way
to
a

of

and
bitter
commercial
warfare
of
constant
increase
in

of
eager
rivalry
in
seizing

accompanied

on

by

of

heavy

which
rested
upon

and
the
constant
danger
that
the
work
of

would
be
rudely
interrupted
hardly
justified
the
optimism
of
the
earlier
decades
the
pronunciamento
of
the

in

of

the
growth
of

and

consequent

out
hopes
of
a
better
future
an
analysis
of
the
majority
which
gladstone
had
obtained
in
the
general
election
of
showed
that
the
prospects
of
home
rule
for
ireland
were
slight
this
majority
was
composed
of
an
english
minority
supported
by
scottish
welsh
and
irish
groups
the
bill
which
was
introduced
in
the
following
year
differed
from
the
previous
bill
in
that
it
did
not
withdraw
the
irish
members
from
westminster
although
the
house
of
commons
gave
it
a
small
majority
it
was
defeated
in
the
lords
gladstone
felt
that
his
support
was
too
precarious
to
force
the
question
to
a
final
settlement
by
an
appeal
to
the
country
he
accordingly
turned
his
attention
to
the
remainder
of
his
programme
the
most
important
part
of
which
was
a
parish
councils
bill
this
aimed
to
do
for
local
government
in
the
parishes
what
the
previous
salisbury
ministry
had
done
for
local
government
in
the
counties
after
the
success
of
the
bill
was
assured
gladstone
withdrew
and
lord
rosebery
became
gladstone
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
retirement
the
rosebery
ministry
soon
fell
and
a
new
salisbury
ministry
dissolved
parliament
in
the
general
election
of
the
conservatives
and
their
allies
the
received
an
overwhelming
majority
this
took
the
home
rule
question
out
of
practical
politics
only
through
a
series
of
minor
concessions
was
the
attempt
to
be
made
to
satisfy
ireland
legitimate
aspirations
this
victory
also
showed
that
english
public
sentiment
was
ready
to
break
definitely
with
the
principles
of
gladstone
and
his
friends
and
support
a
policy
of
energetic
imperialism
the

whose
jubilee
was
again
celebrated
in
died
on
january
the
new
king
edward
at
the
age
of
was
crowned
in
germany
bismarck
later
since
when
bismarck
abandoned
his
alliance
with
the
national
liberals
he
had
been
endeavoring
to
increase
the
financial
strength
of
the
empire
by
changing
the
customs
and
excise
system
to
conquer
the
socialists
both
by
direct
attack
and
by
taking
the
working
classes
under
the
special
care
of
the
state
and
more
recently
to
procure
for
germany
colonial
possessions
although
his
new
financial
policy
was
definitely
protectionist
his
chief
aim
was
to
free
the
imperial
government
from
the
need
of
applying
to
the
different
states
for
a
subvention
in
consequence
of
his
policy
the
income
from
customs
and
excises
rose
in
ten
years
from
marks
to
but
the
plan
of
state
subventions
although
altered
in
fact
was
preserved
in
appearance
for
bismarck
was
obliged
to
concede
to
particularist
jealousies
that
all
income
from
these
sources
above
must
be
paid
to
the
states
and
the
deficiency
in
the
imperial
treasury
be
made
up
in
the
usual
manner
later
on
the
new
naval
programme
again
made
state
contributions
a
reality
in
the
laws
to
protect
the
workingmen
bismarck
affirmed
this
to
be
the
duty
of
the
christian
state
he
did
not
concede
that
such
measures
were
simply
the
right
of
the
workmen
the
plan
was
carried
out
in
three
great
laws
that
of
insurance
in
case
of
illness
in
case
of
accident
in
mines
or
factories
and
in
case
of
old
age
or
incapacity
these
laws
were
enacted
in
the
face
of
much
outcry
from
employers
and
were
effectively
administered
they
did
not
however
so
far
remove
the
grievances
of
the
lower
classes
as
to
check
the
growth
of
the
social
democratic
party
although
the
party
has
since
embodied
in
its
programme
the
theories
of
marx
it
is
not
wholly
socialistic
in
character
it
is
also
a
protest
of
the
democratic
spirit
against
the
administration
of
germany
as
an
aristocratic
military
monarchy
in
the
face
of
repressive
laws
the
party
grew
steadily
so
that
in
it
was
able
to
cast
votes
the
only
force
able
to
resist
its
advance
was
the
catholic
center
because
the
catholic
church
included
among
its
members
all
classes
in
the
community
while
the
protestant
church
in
the
cities
at
least
was
more
generally
composed
of
the
employing
class
from
bismarck
had
put
germany
forward
as
an
eager
competitor
for
colonial
acquisitions
in
africa
and
the
pacific
the
lands
that
germany
was
able
to
obtain
were
hardly
suited
to
distinctively
german
settlement
and
afforded
comparatively
little
advantage
to
trade
bismarck
william
ii
began
by
continuing
the
policies
which
had
been
characteristic
of
the
closing
years
of
his
reign
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
restive
under
the
leadership
of
bismarck
he
desired
to
make
his
own
personal
aims
more
prominent
in
there
was
a
struggle
over
the
renewal
of
the
laws
against
the
socialists
and
a
consequent
general
election
the
emperor
seized
the
opportunity
to
declare
his
purpose
to
improve
still
further
the
situation
of
the
working
classes
and
with
this
in
view
to
call
an
international
congress
in
prussia
he
declared
it
to
be
the
duty
of
the
state
to
regulate
the
conditions
of
labor
such
declarations
took
the
control
of
the
electoral
campaign
out
of
bismarck
hands
one
result
was
decided
losses
for
the
conservative
groups
bismarck
tried
to
maintain
his
ascendency
by
insisting
that
according
to
a
cabinet
order
of
frederick
william
the
king
of
prussia
must
communicate
with
the
ministers
through
the
president
of
the
council
william
retorted
by
denying
bismarck
right
to
negotiate
with
the
chiefs
of
the
parliamentary
groups
and
by
requiring
a
decree
reversing
the
obnoxious
cabinet
order
on
march
he
demanded
bismarck
resignation
bismarck
left
berlin
amid
a
great
ovation
a
few
days
later
for
some
years
he
and
his
friends
formed
an
unofficial
center
of
opposition
and
criticism
he
died
in
july
germany
since
bismarck
bismarck
successors
were
count
caprivi
prince
hohenlobe
and
count
b√ºlow
it
was
tacitly
recognized
that
the
laws
had
failed
and
they
were
not
renewed
the
socialists
as
well
as
all
other
groups
received
the
additional
advantage
that
somewhat
later
a
law
was
passed
permitting
societies
of
all
kinds
to
affiliate
it
was
estimated
that
in
the
social
democrats
controlled
over
votes
the
government
vainly
attempted
to
dike
the
rising
flood
by
laws
providing
a
practical
censorship
of
art
and
of
literature
but
these
had
to
be
abandoned
in
the
parliamentary
life
of
germany
the
most
significant
change
was
the
disintegration
of
the
old
parties
the
strengthening
of
such
groups
as
the
catholic
center
and
the
social
democrats
and
the
creation
of
a
strong
agrarian
party
or
interest
the
agrarians
became
prominent
during
the
controversy
over
a
commercial
treaty
with
russia
this
treaty
was
part
of
a
general
attempt
to
develop
the
european
market
to
make
good
the
loss
through
the
adoption
of
high
tariffs
in
countries
like
america
and
france
and
at
first
by
russia
herself
although
germany
could
not
furnish
enough
grain
to
feed
her
own
people
and
there
was
a
tariff
on
imported
grain
the
price
kept
falling
while
the
prices
of
manufactured
articles
steadily
increased
the
peasants
and
the
landowners
felt
that
they
were
threatened
with
ruin
accordingly
they
formed
an
alliance
in
and
a
parliamentary
union
which
from
that
time
on
was
so
formidable
as
to
force
important
concessions
from
the
government
among
other
important
measures
of
this
period
were
the
adoption
of
a
new
civil
code
for
the
empire
to
go
into
effect
the
reduction
of
the
term
of
military
service
to
two
years
and
the
efforts
by
the
successive
naval
programmes
of
and
to
create
for
germany
a
strong
sea
power
capable
of
supporting
her
trade
and
colonial
aspirations
france
in
the
continuance
of
the
republic
was
endangered
by
the
support
which
many
of
its
enemies
and
some
of
its
ignorant
friends
lent
to
the
pretensions
of
general
boulanger
who
had
made
himself
popular
as
minister
of
war
by
his
army
reforms
and
by
his
belligerent
attitude
toward
germany
when
he
ceased
to
be
minister
and
particularly
after
he
was
deprived
of
his
military
command
he
began
an
energetic
propaganda
for
a
revision
of
the
constitution
with
the
cry
dissolution
revision
constituent
the
royalists
gave
freely
to
further
the
campaign
hoping
that
moderate
men
would
be
frightened
into
calling
the
count
of
paris
to
the
throne
in
order
to
save
the
country
from
another
military
empire
the
boulangists
took
skillful
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
deputies
representing
each
department
were
elected
at
large
and
not
on
single
district
tickets
so
that
it
was
possible
for
boulanger
name
to
be
placed
on
each
departmental
ticket
and
so
in
time
to
receive
the
votes
of
all
france
with
such
a
mandate
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
moderate
republicans
to
resist
him
for
a
time
the
scheme
was
successful
boulanger
was
even
elected
on
the
paris
list
had
he
been
willing
to
undertake
a
coup
he
might
then
have
overthrown
the
republic
but
he
wished
for
a
more
peaceful
triumph
at
the
approaching
general
election
this
his
opponents
deprived
him
of
by
abolishing
the
method
of
election
at
large
so
that
each
deputy
was
to
represent
a
particular
district
boulanger
was
soon
after
attacked
on
a
charge
of
treason
before
the
senate
acting
as
a
high
court
he
fled
to
belgium
and
a
little
later
committed
suicide
on
the
grave
of
his
mistress
panama
hardly
had
the
danger
from
boulanger
subsided
when
in
many
of
the
leading
politicians
were
discredited
by
the
disclosures
made
in
the
judicial
investigation
of
the
bankruptcy
of
the
panama
canal
company
it
appeared
that
the
company
had
spent
large
sums
to
muzzle
the
press
so
that
ignorant
investors
should
not
discover
the
precarious
condition
of
the
enterprise
it
had
also
contributed
to
the
campaign
expenses
of
friendly
deputies
and
directly
purchased
votes
in
order
to
obtain
authority
to
negotiate
a
loan
in
a
manner
ordinarily
illegal
although
several
deputies
and
senators
were
tried
no
one
was
convicted
save
an
who
confessed
that
he
had
accepted
francs
had
the
exposure
come
a
little
earlier
it
must
have
led
to
the
triumph
of
boulanger
its
principal
consequence
was
to
bring
new
men
of
less
tarnished
reputations
to
the
front
the
in
the
same
year
the
church
with
direct
encouragement
and
even
pressure
from
pope
leo
xiii
rallied
to
the
support
of
the
republic
the
pope
issued
an
encyclical
to
french
catholics
and
followed
this
by
a
letter
to
the
french
cardinals
many
royalists
were
afflicted
by
this
attitude
but
nearly
all
were
submissive
they
called
themselves
the
constitutional
party
but
were
also
called
the
rallied
their
watchword
seemed
to
be
accept
the
constitution
in
order
to
modify
legislation
the
radical
revolutionary
groups
which
had
been
crushed
in
the
suppression
of
the
commune
of
and
which
had
not
been
able
to
reconstitute
themselves
effectively
until
the
amnesty
of
began
in
the
early
nineties
to
make
their
influence
more
effective
this
coincided
with
a
general
shifting
of
political
power
toward
the
left
the
assassination
of
president
carnot
in
and
the
enthusiasm
provoked
by
the
cementing
of
the
russian
alliance
and
by
the
coming
of
the
czar
to
paris
prolonged
the
control
of
the
moderates
or
progressists
as
they
were
called
in
it
was
the
persistent
attacks
of
the
radicals
that
disgusted
with
the
presidency
his
successor
was
f√©lix
faure
a
successful
business
man
when
he
died
suddenly
in
√©mile
loubet
was
chosen
by
the
support
of
the
groups
of
the
left
before
the
moderate
republicans
lost
control
they
revolutionized
the
economic
policy
of
france
substituting
for
practical
free
trade
and
commercial
treaties
a
high
protective
tariff
dreyfus
france
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
panama
scandal
before
she
was
involved
in
another
scandal
far
more
subtle
in
its
demoralizing
influence
jealousy
of
the
success
of
jewish
financiers
strengthened
by
the
common
feeling
that
capitalists
are
enriched
by
gains
led
to
an
obscure
campaign
against
the
jews
and
all
capitalists
the
reminiscences
of
panama
did
not
allay
these
feelings
soon
the
royalists
seized
this
instrument
as
a
means
of
discrediting
the
republic
asserting
that
it
had
been
organized
through
the
influence
of
immigrants
who
were
enriching
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
thrifty
but
guileless
french
it
was
also
asserted
that
jews
in
the
army
were
betraying
its
secrets
to
their
german
kindred
as
the
army
was
universally
popular
this
was
an
effective
blow
at
the
jews
the
denouement
was
the
arrest
of
captain
dreyfus
his
degradation
and
his
confinement
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
french
guiana
the
evidence
had
been
slight
and
it
was
discredited
when
a
courageous
officer
of
the
intelligence
department
told
his
superiors
that
even
this
had
been
constructed
by
a
major
esterhazy
the
officer
colonel
picquart
was
removed
and
his
place
taken
by
colonel
henry
who
undertook
to
supply
the
necessary
evidence
although
he
imposed
on
the
minister
of
war
he
was
unable
to
endure
the
moral
strain
especially
after
distinguished
men
like
zola
became
champions
of
the
innocence
of
dreyfus
and
he
committed
suicide
after
making
a
confession
the
government
was
obliged
to
bring
the
case
before
the
court
of
cassation
in
which
ordered
a
new
trial
although
dreyfus
was
again
convicted
by
a
military
court
he
was
immediately
pardoned
by
the
president
other
after
the
situation
in
became
precarious
owing
to
the
difficulties
which
arose
when
the
time
came
to
renew
the
or
agreement
between
austria
and
hungary
first
made
in
neither
portion
of
the
empire
was
satisfied
with
its
part
of
the
bargain
as
the
hungarians
always
stood
together
in
any
struggle
with
austria
they
were
likely
to
get
the
better
of
the
bargain
there
was
the
additional
difficulty
that
no
agreement
of
any
sort
could
be
adopted
in
the
austrian
parliament
which
had
become
hopelessly
disorganized
through
the
savage
conflicts
between
the
various
groups
germans
czechs
etc
the
only
way
to
prevent
the
actual
dissolution
of
the
empire
was
to
renew
the
agreement
in
behalf
of
austria
by
imperial
warrant
another
country
belonging
to
the
triple
alliance
italy
was
brought
into
trouble
by
the
policy
of
extravagant
expansion
pursued
especially
under
the
leadership
of
crispi
but
the
disastrous
defeat
by
the
abyssinians
at
adowa
in
gave
pause
to
the
plans
of
such
statesmen
spain
also
suffered
disaster
in
this
period
first
through
the
outbreak
of
revolt
in
cuba
and
then
through
the
loss
of
the
remnant
of
her
once
splendid
colonial
empire
in
consequence
of
the
war
with
the
united
states
european
the
foundation
of
the
triple
alliance
had
been
laid
by
the
treaty
between
germany
and
austria
to
this
italy
had
acceded
in
such
a
combination
tended
to
bring
russia
and
france
together
especially
as
russia
began
to
see
that
the
only
power
pursuing
a
policy
favorable
to
her
desires
was
france
finally
russian
and
french
officers
were
authorized
to
arrange
for
the
possible
co√∂peration
of
armies
in
case
of
war
and
in
a
military
convention
was
completed
that
there
came
to
be
a
definite
understanding
still
more
comprehensive
has
been
generally
believed
but
its
terms
were
not
divulged
the
french
minister
of
foreign
affairs
used
the
word
alliance
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
in
and
two
years
later
when
president
faure
visited
the
czar
at
petersburg
the
czar
used
the
phrase
two
great
nations
friends
and
allies
the
consequence
of
these
two
alliances
and
of
the
peaceful
policy
pursued
by
england
was
the
localizing
of
difficulties
and
the
maintenance
of
a
concert
on
all
questions
likely
to
embroil
europe
this
was
evident
from
the
treatment
of
the
eastern
the
african
and
the
far
eastern
questions
bulgarian
affairs
had
not
received
their
final
solution
at
the
berlin
congress
for
the
peaceful
revolution
of
philippopolis
in
had
forcibly
reunited
bulgaria
and
east
roumelia
but
the
powers
did
not
recognize
the
change
until
prince
alexander
had
withdrawn
and
prince
ferdinand
had
placed
himself
more
under
russian
tutelage
making
this
emphatic
by
the
decision
to
bring
up
his
son
prince
boris
according
to
the
greek
rite
the
success
of
bulgaria
rendered
the
armenians
envious
discontent
at
the
failure
to
carry
out
the
reforms
promised
by
the
treaty
of
berlin
led
to
the
formation
of
a
revolutionary
party
which
hoped
by
provoking
a
turkish
repression
similar
to
the
bulgarian
atrocities
to
necessitate
a
new
european
intervention
such
a
scheme
was
opposed
by
american
missionaries
and
by
the
native
clergy
for
they
saw
that
it
was
doomed
to
disaster
the
revolutionists
endeavored
to
compromise
the
missionaries
by
posting
their
placards
on
the
walls
of
the
american
college
at
marsivan
the
suspicions
of
the
turks
were
directed
against
the
missionaries
and
the
girls
schoolhouse
was
burned
by
a
mob
ostensibly
to
capture
agitators
the
kurds
followed
by
the
regular
troops
perpetrated
terrible
massacres
in
the
mountain
villages
of
sas√∫n
in
and
the
powers
could
not
agree
upon
any
common
plan
to
check
such
evils
and
when
they
did
force
upon
the
sultan
a
scheme
of
reform
it
served
only
as
a
signal
for
worse
massacres
which
recurred
chronically
until
the
final
massacre
in
constantinople
in
august
as
the
concert
was
honeycombed
by
jealousies
it
was
impossible
to
do
more
than
prevent
the
development
of
this
horror
into
a
general
european
war
england
was
unable
to
intervene
separately
because
of
the
hostile
attitude
of
russia
such
statesmen
as
lord
salisbury
recognized
that
traditional
support
of
turkey
had
been
discredited
by
such
events
when
in
the
following
year
war
broke
out
between
greece
and
turkey
and
when
crete
fell
into
a
state
of
anarchy
the
powers
were
more
successful
in
their
common
action
for
they
were
able
to
mitigate
the
terms
which
the
victorious
turks
demanded
and
to
withdraw
crete
from
direct
turkish
control
the
history
of
egypt
touches
both
the
situation
in
the
turkish
empire
and
the
more
general
situation
of
africa
and
the
routes
to
the
far
east
england
occupation
of
egypt
at
first
considered
temporary
gave
her
practical
control
of
the
suez
canal
it
also
gave
her
a
strong
position
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
the
lack
of
which
had
been
one
reason
for
her
hostility
to
the
treaty
of
san
stefano
in
the
problem
of
the
equatorial
provinces
had
remained
vexatious
ever
since
the
triumph
of
the
mahdi
and
of
his
successor
the
kalifa
any
attempt
to
begin
a
campaign
for
their
recovery
was
hindered
by
the
peculiar
financial
condition
of
egypt
as
all
the
funds
were
either
mortgaged
to
creditors
or
at
least
under
an
international
control
not
favorable
to
the
presence
of
england
the
only
money
absolutely
under
the
control
of
the
egyptian
government
was
a
special
reserve
fund
the
result
of
painful
administrative
economies
but
the
necessity
of
an
advance
was
imperative
although
the
attempt
of
the
congo
free
state
to
establish
a
permanent
foothold
in
the
upper
nile
basin
had
been
checked
by
england
france
was
striving
to
extend
her
territorial
possessions
straight
across
from
senegal
to
jibutil
on
the
gulf
of
aden
major
marchand
had
left
paris
secretly
in
with
this
mission
in
this
year
also
the
defeat
of
the
italians
at
adowa
and
the
pressure
of
the
troops
of
the
kalifa
upon
kassala
held
by
the
italians
for
the
english
did
not
permit
longer
delay
a
great
preparatory
work
had
been
done
in
the
ten
years
previous
a
new
army
had
been
created
the
advance
began
in
march
under
the
leadership
of
sir
herbert
kitchener
one
of
its
most
effective
and
brilliant
features
was
the
construction
in
the
following
year
of
a
railway
miles
across
the
nubian
desert
to
save
a
river
journey
of
miles
the
decisive
campaign
took
place
in
with
the
battle
on
the
atbara
and
the
crushing
defeat
of
the
kalifa
at
omdurman
in
september
during
the
summer
marchand
had
been
establishing
posts
in
the
upper
nile
region
as
far
as
fashoda
kitchener
immediately
proceeded
thither
raised
the
english
and
egyptian
flags
near
by
leaving
the
settlement
of
the
question
to
diplomacy
the
french
not
being
supported
by
russia
in
an
aggressive
attitude
were
obliged
to
give
way
and
their
sphere
of
influence
was
not
to
include
any
portion
of
the
nile
basin
the
war
had
been
economically
managed
so
that
egyptian
finances
were
not
seriously
disarranged
the
help
that
england
was
obliged
to
give
justified
her
in
considering
the
sudan
as
territory
held
jointly
by
her
and
by
egypt
the
general
consequence
of
english
rule
in
egypt
has
been
a
reduction
of
taxation
and
at
the
same
time
the
collection
of
a
larger
revenue
vast
public
improvements
like
the
dam
at
assouan
also
added
to
the
resources
of
the
country
although
africa
since
had
been
the
subject
of
an
important
conference
at
berlin
and
of
various
international
agreements
it
was
strictly
speaking
beyond
the
sphere
of
action
of
the
european
concert
its
partition
among
the
european
states
a
movement
originating
in
the
expeditions
of
livingstone
and
stanley
went
on
rapidly
from
the
congo
free
state
which
at
first
promised
to
be
an
international
enterprise
speedily
changed
into
a
territorial
possession
of
the
king
of
belgium
when
in
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
raise
funds
for
the
support
of
his
rule
it
was
agreed
that
the
reversion
of
the
territory
belonged
to
belgium
as
a
colony
king
leopold
as
already
remarked
made
an
attempt
to
establish
his
authority
over
a
part
of
the
upper
nile
basin
but
here
he
was
thwarted
by
the
ambition
of
both
england
and
france
england
undertook
to
lease
the
in
consideration
of
the
lease
from
him
of
a
strip
fifteen
and
a
half
miles
wide
along
the
eastern
border
of
the
state
in
order
to
make
possible
the
scheme
of
a
railway
on
land
under
british
control
from
the
cape
to
cairo
this
scheme
was
defeated
by
the
germans
as
well
as
by
the
french
the
portuguese
were
in
turn
prevented
from
extending
their
holdings
from
angola
to
mozambique
the
french
and
the
english
though
each
disappointed
in
their
extreme
purposes
made
substantial
gains
england
in
the
regions
north
of
the
cape
across
the
zambezi
in
uganda
and
in
the
sudan
france
in
western
and
northern
africa
so
that
all
the
northwest
except
the
coast
colonies
and
the
independent
sultanate
of
morocco
came
under
her
power
france
also
turned
her
protectorate
of
madagascar
into
a
colonial
possession
england
policy
of
expansion
together
with
difficulties
arising
out
of
the
gold
mining
industry
involved
her
in
a
war
with
the
boer
republics
the
south
african
republic
and
the
orange
free
state
the
center
of
the
mining
industry
was
johannesberg
so
rich
were
the
mines
that
the
foreign
population
there
soon
outnumbered
the
boers
these
foreigners
or
uitlanders
desired
all
the
privileges
of
englishmen
although
they
had
become
residents
in
a
state
ruled
by
primitive
agriculturists
they
claimed
that
their
industry
was
ruinously
hampered
by
unwise
taxation
so
great
did
their
sense
of
wrong
become
that
they
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
cecil
rhodes
premier
of
cape
colony
and
with
jameson
administrator
of
the
south
african
chartered
company
in
accordance
with
which
at
a
given
signal
they
were
to
rise
and
jameson
with
armed
troopers
was
to
come
to
their
assistance
jameson
did
not
wait
for
the
signal
the
scheme
broke
down
and
he
and
his
troops
were
captured
to
the
boers
all
this
seemed
to
be
an
english
plot
against
their
independence
and
so
they
became
more
suspicious
through
a
series
of
incidents
the
colonial
secretary
joseph
chamberlain
was
led
to
attempt
to
extort
by
force
from
the
boers
the
desired
concessions
before
the
diplomatic
campaign
was
well
begun
new
issues
were
introduced
both
parties
began
to
prepare
for
war
and
finally
in
october
the
boers
took
the
initiative
and
invaded
the
british
colonies
the
war
was
at
first
disastrous
for
the
english
but
finally
through
a
large
army
under
lord
roberts
the
boers
were
driven
from
both
the
transvaal
and
the
orange
free
state
which
were
occupied
and
declared
to
be
colonies
of
the
empire
but
it
was
not
until
three
years
after
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
the
last
boer
bands
were
compelled
by
lord
kitchener
to
surrender
and
the
country
was
pacified
england
influence
in
south
africa
was
greatly
strengthened
by
this
victory
although
her
prestige
in
the
world
at
large
was
somewhat
compromised
the
far
before
the
close
of
the
century
the
interest
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
near
east
was
transferred
to
the
far
east
the
first
indication
of
this
was
the
action
of
the
powers
at
the
close
of
the
war
which
broke
out
between
japan
and
china
in
over
their
relations
to
korea
japan
was
triumphant
demonstrating
in
the
battle
of
the
yaloo
river
the
superiority
of
her
new
navy
she
occupied
the
peninsula
of
liaotung
and
port
arthur
a
harbor
of
strategic
importance
she
demanded
a
cession
of
this
peninsula
together
with
formosa
and
a
large
indemnity
russia
germany
and
france
intervened
and
kept
japan
from
establishing
herself
on
the
mainland
this
action
did
not
appear
altogether
in
the
interest
of
china
for
each
of
the
three
powers
soon
asked
of
china
quite
as
important
concessions
for
themselves
france
in
the
south
germany
at
kiaochow
and
russia
at
port
arthur
which
compelled
england
to
guard
her
interests
by
leasing
opposite
port
arthur
at
this
time
began
the
marking
out
of
spheres
of
influence
a
practical
partition
of
china
accompanied
by
demands
of
all
sorts
of
railway
and
mining
concessions
this
unedifying
pressure
from
aggressive
europeans
seemed
for
a
time
to
awaken
china
the
emperor
began
to
urge
forward
reform
it
was
thought
that
china
might
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
japan
but
suddenly
there
was
a
palace
revolution
the
seized
control
and
the
reformers
had
to
fly
for
their
lives
closely
following
this
came
a
serious
outbreak
led
by
the
boxers
and
encouraged
by
certain
high
officials
before
europe
was
aware
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
it
was
alarmed
by
the
report
that
the
foreign
legations
at
pekin
had
been
besieged
captured
and
massacred
although
this
was
a
false
report
it
was
true
that
from
june
to
august
the
legations
were
besieged
partly
by
a
mob
and
partly
by
chinese
regulars
the
siege
was
raised
by
a
mixed
expedition
of
european
and
japanese
troops
sent
from
the
coast
the
satisfaction
with
which
the
news
of
rescue
was
received
in
europe
was
chilled
by
stories
that
some
portions
of
the
expeditionary
corps
had
been
guilty
of
crimes
only
to
be
paralleled
in
the
history
of
european
wars
in
the
seventeenth
century
after
the
war
a
difficult
diplomatic
question
remained
all
the
more
puzzling
because
the
ambitions
of
the
powers
prevented
any
hearty
agreement
among
them
these
questions
were
only
in
appearance
settled
by
the
signing
of
the
protocol
in
january
attention
was
fixed
upon
russia
supported
by
a
new
instrument
of
influence
the
railway
because
it
appeared
to
be
her
purpose
to
establish
her
power
in
manchuria
on
a
permanent
basis
during
the
boer
war
the
english
colonies
by
their
loyal
and
generous
cooperation
strengthened
the
bonds
of
empire
and
forced
to
the
front
schemes
to
render
the
imperial
tie
more
practically
beneficial
and
effective
one
of
these
groups
succeeded
in
completing
its
own
federal
organization
this
was
australia
active
effort
towards
federation
was
begun
in
by
sir
henry
parkes
but
not
until
six
years
later
was
public
sentiment
sufficiently
aroused
the
main
difficulty
as
in
the
case
of
the
american
colonies
was
to
reconcile
the
differing
and
to
establish
a
proper
balance
between
the
larger
and
the
smaller
states
finally
in
these
difficulties
were
overcome
and
all
the
colonies
save
new
zealand
voted
to
become
parts
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia
each
state
was
to
have
six
senators
and
to
be
represented
in
the
lower
house
in
proportion
to
its
population
although
no
state
was
to
have
fewer
than
five
representatives
matters
of
taxation
were
more
fully
intrusted
to
the
lower
house
than
in
the
united
states
for
a
time
it
seemed
impossible
to
settle
the
delicate
questions
of
appeal
to
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
of
england
the
only
instrument
of
control
left
in
the
hands
of
the
home
government
but
this
was
settled
by
a
judicious
compromise
during
the
last
decade
not
only
australia
but
also
new
zealand
made
many
interesting
attempts
to
solve
labor
and
social
problems
by
legislation
although
the
prosperity
of
australia
received
heavy
blows
after
it
began
to
recover
after
and
to
advance
towards
its
earlier
level
united

cleveland
second
although
the
mckinley
tariff
aided
in
elevating
its
author
to
the
presidency
its
first
political
consequences
were
not
helpful
to
the
republican
party
in
there
was
a
popular
cry
for
tariff
reduction
and
cleveland
was
triumphantly
elected
by
the
democrats
who
also
obtained
control
of
both
houses
of
congress
president
cleveland
purpose
of
reforming
the
tariff
was
hindered
at
first
by
a
grave
financial
and
industrial
crisis
which
came
in
the
spring
of
the
causes
of
this
crisis
were
the
extravagant
inflation
of
business
during
the
preceding
years
a
financial
policy
accompanied
by
the
purchase
for
coinage
of
vast
quantities
of
silver
and
the
natural
timidity
of
capital
while
the
economic
policy
of
the
government
was
in
danger
of
fundamental
change
the
opponents
of
the
administration
took
skillful
advantage
of
the
panic
to
bring
its
policies
into
discredit
so
great
was
the
stringency
of
the
money
market
especially
on
account
of
the
depletion
of
the
gold
reserve
in
the
treasury
that
president
cleveland
was
obliged
to
call
an
extra
session
of
congress
and
to
urge
upon
that
body
the
repeal
of
the
law
requiring
the
monthly
purchases
of
silver
for
coinage
this
measure
adopted
by
the
senate
with
evident
reluctance
in
the
late
fall
did
not
wholly
relieve
the
situation
and
to
maintain
the
gold
reserve
and
defend
its
credit
the
government
was
forced
four
times
to
issue
bonds
for
more
gold
the
consequence
of
which
was
the
increase
of
the
public
debt
by
over
during
the
controversies
upon
monetary
legislation
the
president
had
alienated
many
members
of
his
party
in
the
house
and
particularly
in
the
senate
he
was
unable
to
bring
them
together
for
such
tariff
legislation
as
had
been
promised
a
bill
was
passed
which
also
embodied
income
tax
provisions
and
this
bill
became
a
law
without
the
president
signature
not
long
afterwards
the
supreme
court
declared
the
clauses
unconstitutional
since
the
tariff
bill
did
not
produce
the
expected
revenue
the
government
was
obliged
to
face
an
ominous
deficit
the
president
however
by
his
courage
and
honesty
upheld
the
national
credit
despite
attacks
from
his
own
party
his
foreign
policy
save
in
one
instance
was
conservative
he
refused
to
take
advantage
of
the
hawaiian
revolution
to
bring
on
the
annexation
of
those
islands
and
he
endeavored
to
maintain
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
in
the
struggle
between
spain
and
the
cuban
revolutionists
but
he
intervened
in
a
boundary
dispute
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
insisting
that
the
question
should
be
submitted
to
arbitration
rather
than
be
settled
on
the
terms
imposed
by
the
stronger
mckinley
in
the
campaign
of
the
older
leaders
of
the
democracy
were
thrust
aside
and
william
bryan
became
the
party
candidate
with
the
free
coinage
of
silver
at
the
ratio
of
to
as
its
watchword
this
appealed
strongly
to
the
distressed
debtor
class
very
numerous
in
the
west
on
account
of
the
hard
times
the
tone
of
the
platform
and
of
the
speeches
of
the
leaders
was
such
as
to
attract
the
workingmen
the
republicans
nominated
mckinley
with
the
promise
to
reenact
the
former
tariff
legislation
to
foster
industries
and
to
protect
the
financial
credit
of
the
country
the
success
of
the
republicans
was
at
first
doubtful
but
the
conservative
interests
became
alarmed
and
finally
the
republicans
gained
a
decisive
victory
by
the
time
president
mckinley
was
inaugurated
the
period
of
business
liquidation
and
readjustment
was
over
confidence
had
returned
and
so
the
new
president
became
as
campaign
placards
of
his
party
had
announced
the
advance
agent
of
prosperity
the
tariff
was
restored
to
its
older
level
the
monetary
system
was
reformed
and
the
gold
standard
legally
established
it
was
not
this
legislation
however
that
rendered
the
period
significant
it
was
the
adoption
of
a
new
national
policy
of
expansion
incident
to
the
war
with
spain
the
spaniards
had
been
unable
to
put
down
the
cuban
insurrection
the
drastic
measures
especially
the
policy
of
reconcentration
adopted
by
general
weyler
had
discredited
the
spanish
cause
the
ancient
tradition
of
spain
cruelty
to
her
colonies
predisposed
the
american
people
to
credit
reports
of
atrocity
the
administration
was
apparently
anxious
to
perform
its
duties
as
a
friendly
power
but
this
was
rendered
more
and
more
difficult
owing
to
the
growing
popular
demand
for
intervention
on
the
of
february
the
american
battleship
was
blown
up
in
havana
harbor
although
there
was
no
decisive
proof
that
this
was
due
to
the
spaniards
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
in
the
popular
mind
a
little
later
the
spaniards
were
ready
to
make
any
concessions
short
of
an
actual
abandonment
of
their
sovereignty
it
was
now
too
late
there
was
an
irresistible
demand
for
war
and
war
was
declared
in
april
the
result
was
inevitable
and
spain
was
obliged
to
yield
sooner
than
was
anticipated
her
fleet
at
manila
was
destroyed
by
admiral
dewey
may
and
her
west
india
squadron
by
the
fleet
in
which
rear
admiral
sampson
held
the
chief
command
on
july
meantime
a
small
american
army
had
rendered
santiago
untenable
after
the
surrender
of
santiago
porto
rico
was
soon
overrun
manila
which
had
been
under
the
american
guns
since
may
was
also
forced
to
surrender
a
protocol
signed
in
august
led
to
the
negotiation
of
peace
in
december
according
to
its
terms
not
only
was
cuba
to
be
evacuated
but
porto
rico
the
philippines
and
the
ladrones
were
to
become
american
possessions
in
this
way
a
war
begun
because
of
popular
sympathy
with
the
cubans
turned
into
a
means
of
territorial
expansion
the
resistance
to
the
policy
of
an
expansion
of
this
sort
was
strong
in
certain
sections
of
the
country
many
senators
held
similar
opinions
long
delaying
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
of
peace
colonial
simultaneously
with
the
ratification
of
the

war
broke
out
in
the
philippines
between
the
american
army
and
the
natives
whose
leaders
had
been
bent
on
securing
independence
the
american
troops
easily
defeated
the
organized
native
armies
though
one
consequence
of
the
struggle
was
widespread
ruin
in
the
island
of
luzon
but
they
were
unable
for
over
two
years
to
pacify
the
country
even
before
these
troubles
were
ended
measures
were
taken
to
substitute
a
civil
for
a
military
administration
which
went
into
effect
in
the
summer
of
porto
rico
was
organized
as
a
partly
autonomous
territory
and
although
on
its
trade
with
the
united
states
there
was
not
at
first
a
full
freedom
from
tariff
restrictions
these
subsequently
disappeared
in
dealing
with
cuba
there
had
been
no
formal
recognition
of
the
revolutionary
organization
it
was
suspected
by
many
that
the
military
occupation
would
be
prolonged
until
annexation
was
brought
about
but
the
president
insisted
upon
the
fulfilment
of
the
pledges
which
had
been
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
a
cuban
convention
agreed
to
a
treaty
in
accordance
with
which
the
united
states
acquired
the
right
to
intervene
to
guarantee
the
independence
of
the
island
should
this
be
endangered
by
entanglements
with
foreign
states
the
cubans
also
promised
to
sell
or
lease
to
the
united
states
sites
for
naval
stations
the
army
of
occupation
was
then
withdrawn
and
the
new
government
inaugurated
in
even
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
president
mckinley
had
endeavored
to
bring
about
the
annexation
of
the
hawaiian
islands
but
it
required
such
a
pressing
need
of
a
controlling
position
in
the
as
the
hostilities
emphasized
to
overcome
the
opposition
it
was
not
until
after
the
war
closed
that
the
islands
were
organized
as
a
territory
about
the
same
time
england
withdrew
from
her
joint
control
of
samoa
and
germany
agreed
with
the
united
states
for
a
partition
of
the
group
active
preparations
were
also
made
for
the
building
of
an
interoceanic
canal
through
nicaragua
or
the
isthmus
of
panama
on
the
route
laid
out
by
the
french
with
these
questions
of
expansion
and
colonial
government
other
equally
important
problems
growing
out
of
the
new
period
of
prosperity
agitated
the
public
mind
particularly
the
formation
of
gigantic
corporations
a
form
of
organization
which
tended
to
supersede
the
trusts
as
the
state
laws
were
helpless
to
check
abuse
of
power
by
such
corporations
there
was
a
growing
demand
for
the
better
enforcement
of
the
national
laws
already
enacted
or
the
adoption
of
other
laws
more
effective

perhaps
the
most

conclusion
of

which
has
been
reached
in

is
the

it
reappears
in

the

public
during

systems
of

were

an
effective
system
has
always
existed
in

also
especially
in
prussia
there
have
long
been
thorough
provisions
for
the
instruction
of
all
the
young
in
elementary
branches
in

in
consequence
of
the

requiring
primary

the
average
of

has
of
late
steadily
diminished

in

england
has
witnessed
a
very
great
change
in
the
legal
establishment
of
means
of
instruction
in
the
rudiments
of
knowledge
for
the
whole
people
the

act

required
that
every

between
the
ages
of
five
and
fourteen
should
receive
such
teaching
in
england
and
in
some
other
countries
the
employment
of
children
who
have
not
had
a
certain
amount
of
school
instruction
was
prohibited
by
law
in
the
new
kingdom
of
italy
every
commune
having
four
thousand
inhabitants
was
required
by
law
to
maintain
a
primary
school
by
subsequent
legislation
the
compulsory
principle
was
adopted
as
far
as
the
circumstances
of
the
country
would
allow
the
result
has
been
a
most
remarkable
diminution
in
the
numbers
of
the
wholly
illiterate
class
other
european
states
have
made
primary
education
compulsory
for
instance
in
hungary
attendance
at
school
was
made
obligatory
for
children
from
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
year
such
measures
in
behalf
of
general
education
as
governments
have
adopted
in
recent
times
are
founded
to
be
sure
partly
on
the
conscious
need
of
against
ignorance
and
its
baleful
consequences
to
the
state
a
more
directly
humane
impulse
however
mingles
with
this
motive
the
operation
of
benevolent
feeling
is
seen
in
the
multiplying
of
special
schools
for
the
benefit
of
the
blind
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
and
even
of
imbeciles
reform
of
criminal
the
advance
of
humane
sentiment
has
produced
a
reform
of
criminal
law
in
england
in
the
closing
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
two
hundred
and
offenses
that
were
punished
with
death
to
injure
westminster
bridge
to
cut
down
young
trees
to
shoot
at
rabbits
to
steal
property
of
the
value
of
five
shillings
were
capital
offenses
vigorous
and
persevering
opposition
was
made
to
the
mitigation
of
this
bloody
code
sir
began
his
effort
at
reform
by
endeavoring
to
secure
the
repeal
of
these
cruel
laws
one
by
one
his
bills
when
carried
with
difficulty
through
the
commons
were
repeatedly
thrown
out
by
the
house
of
lords
one
of
the
most
strenuous
opponents
of
the
change
was
the
lord
chancellor
lord
the
chief
justice
stigmatized
the
proposed
alteration
of
the
statutes
as
the
fruit
of
speculation
and
modern
philosophy
it
was
predicted
that
if
it
were
made
there
would
be
a
terrible
increase
of
crime
sir
continued
with
success
the
effort
of
romilly
in
the
list
of
capital
offenses
had
been
reduced
to
seven
one
consequence
was
the
striking
diminution
of
crime
another
reform
in
england
was
that
of
the
the
officers
of
the
police
had
encouraged
crime
in
order
to
secure
the
reward
of
forty
pounds
offered
by
the
government
on
conviction
in
the
case
of
crimes
of
a
certain
grade
one
of
the
distinctions
of
modern
philanthropy
is
the
reform
when
began
his
labors
the
prisons
in
england
were
generally
dirty
pestiferous
dens
crowded
with
inmates
of
both
sexes
nurseries
of
loathsome
disease
and
of
still
more
loathsome
vice
soon
after
this
time
a
serious
effort
began
to
make
prisons
a
means
of
reform
instead
of
schools
of
debauchery
and
crime
there
was
a
movement
for
the
erection
of
penitentiaries
of
improved
construction
this
was
aided
by
the
exertions
of
the
most
successful
efforts
in
behalf
of
a
better
system
of
management
in
prisons
were
made
by
members
of
the
society
of
friends
of
these
the
most
useful
person
in
this
cause
was
gurney
a
woman
of
rare
powers
of
mind
and
of
the
noblest
christian
character
by
her
personal
influence
she
wrought
such
a
transformation
of
character
and
behavior
among
the
female
convicts
in
newgate
prison
as
it
had
been
deemed
impossible
to
effect
the
reforms
which
effected
spread
to
other
places
her
labors
were
not
confined
to
great
britain
she
visited
france
belgium
holland
and
other
countries
her
correspondence
in
the
interest
of
the
cause
which
she
served
extended
to
russia
and
italy
her
recommendations
bore
fruit
for
good
in
almost
all
parts
of
europe
signal
improvements
in
plans
of
construction
and
in
the
interior
life
of
prisons
have
been
effected
under
the
auspices
of
the
prison
discipline
society
in
england
in
these
changes
the
example
of
changes
and
reforms
in
this
matter
in
the
united
states
has
had
a
marked
influence
the
two
great
ends
kept
in
view
at
present
in
the
arrangements
and
occupations
of
prisons
are
the
reform
of
the
criminal
and
the
deterring
of
others
from
the
commission
of
crime
distinct
establishments
for
the
detention
reform
and
training
of
juvenile
offenders
who
were
formerly
corrupted
by
association
with
criminals
mature
in
vice
are
peculiar
to
recent
times
the
transportation
of
english
convicts
to
australia
began
in
as
these
multiplied
there
sprang
up
cruelty
on
the
part
of
supervisors
in
the
colonies
and
in
the
penal
settlements
where
the
worst
offenders
were
guarded
there
were
found
the
most
corrupt
and
degraded
herds
of
criminals
the
opposition
in
the
colonial
communities
to
transportation
found
support
in
england
in
deportation
to
new
south
wales
ceased
at
length
van
dieman
land
also
refused
to
receive
this
forced
emigration
even
of
released
convicts
the
british
government
was
obliged
to
rely
on
other
methods
of
punishment
especially
on
the
graduation
of
the
term
of
confinement
according
to
the
conduct
of
the

the

led
in
the
direction
of
as
the
ultimate
goal
it
is
however
a
in
toward
which
the
course
of
history
has
moved
the
development
and
growth
of
distinct
nations
each
after
its
own
type
and
not
less
the
freedom
of
the

necessary
to
the
full
development
of
mankind
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
the
race
the
final
unity
that
is
sought
is
to
be
reached
not
by
stifling
the
capacities
of
human
nature
but
by
the
complete
unfolding
of
them
in
all
their
diversity
the
modern
era
has
made
an
approach
toward
this
higher
unity
that
is
to
coexist
with
a
rich
and
manifold
development
an
enlightened
man
prince
of
england
remarked
in
a
public
address
nobody
who
has
paid
any
attention
to
the
peculiar
features
of
our
present
era
will
doubt
for
a
moment
that
we
are
living
at
a
period
of
most
wonderful
transition
which
tends
rapidly
to
accomplish
that
great
end
to
which
indeed
all
history
points
realization
of
the
unity
of
mankind
not
a
unity
which
breaks
down
the
limits
and
levels
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
different
nations
of
the
earth
but
rather
a
unity
result
and
of
those
very
national
varieties
and
antagonistic
qualities
in
concluding
this
volume
it
is
proper
to
advert
to
some
of
the
signs
and
means
of
this
unification
of
mankind
which
belong
to
the
recent
era
industrial
the
words
quoted
above
from
prince
were
spoken
in
anticipation
of
the
great
international
exhibition
in
london
in
the
industrial
exhibitions
in
which
the
products
of
many
nations
are
collected
and
to
which
visitors
are
drawn
from
different
parts
of
the
earth
are
one
indication
of
the
effect
of
manufactures
and
commerce
in
drawing
mankind
together
the
first
displays
of
this
kind
were
for
french
manufactures
alone
and
were
held
in
paris
in
and
under
the
consulate
of
napoleon
in
and
the
first
exposition
was
in
paris
in
and
it
was
followed
by
the
world
fair
in
london
for
which
the
vast
edifice
called
the
crystal
palace
made
of
iron
and
of
glass
was
constructed
similar
exhibitions
were
held
in

were
shown
by
the
side
of
the
products
of
european
and
american
manufacture
economical
in
connection
with
the
wide
extension
of
commerce
the
better
methods
and
ideas
which
have
come
into
vogue
in
respect
to
commercial
relations
deserve
notice
the
of
facilitating
trade
and
forming
a
bond
of
confidence
and
of
union
between
different
nations
although
it
began
in
the
middle
ages
was
not
fairly
established
until
the
organization
of
the
bank
of
amsterdam
in
this
system
if
it
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
engines
of
warfare
is
likewise
one
of
the
great
pledges
of
peace
the
stimulus
given
to
manufactures
by
mechanical
inventions
has
been
an
effective
promoter
of
commercial
intercourse
the
teaching
of
and
of
the
political
economists
since
his
time
by
which
it
is
seen
that
the
gain
of
one
nation
is
not
the
loss
of
another
and
that
nations
are
mutually
benefited
by
the
interchange
of
the
products
of
their
labor
which
is
the
true
source
of
wealth
has
operated
as
an
antidote
to
discord
the
ruin
of
a
neighbor
or
with
him
has
been
discovered
to
be
as
contrary
to
the
demands
of
a
prudent

of
a
disinterested
benevolence

the

created
by

the
direct
result

that
the

are
such
as
never
occurred
in
former
ages
christian
the
spread
of
the
christian
religion
by
missionary
efforts
is
one
of
the
means
of
unifying
mankind
in
ancient
times
and
in
the
middle
ages
the
two
great
achievements
of
the
church
were
the
conversion
of
the
roman
empire
and
then
of
the
barbarian
nations
by
whom
it
was
subverted
but
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
also
missionary
labor
here
and
there
among
the
saracens
and
in
the
lands
of
the
east
since
the
thirteenth
century
missions
in
the
roman
catholic
church
have
been
chiefly
prosecuted
by
the
monastic
orders
in
this
work
the
jesuits
from
the
first
establishment
of
their
order
were
conspicuously
active
in
all
quarters
of
the
globe
of
their
missionaries
none
have
been
more
eminent
and
zealous
than
who
died
just
as
he
was
about
to
undertake
the
conversion
of
china
protestants
in
the
period
after
the
reformation
were
too
busy
in
the
struggles
going
forward
in
their
own
lands
to
undertake
foreign
missions
on
an
extended
scale
yet
they
were
not
indifferent
to
the
importance
of
the
work
under
the
protectorate
of
an
ordinance
established
a
society
for
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
in

england
in

in
foreign
parts
was
established
in
england
later
the
moravians
from
the
beginning
evinced
great
interest
in
foreign
missions
and
planted
missionary
stations
in
several
countries
in
the
roman
catholic
church
the
congregation
of
the
propaganda
was
founded
in
for
the
general
superintendence
of
missionary
operations
colleges
for
their
training
were
established
the
chief
of
which
was
the
urban
college
at
rome
where
students
from
all
nations
have
been
educated
for
missionary
service
the
nineteenth
century
was
marked
by
an
extraordinary
outburst
of
missionary
activity
in
this
sort
of
exertion
the
roman
catholic
body
has
kept
up
an
unflagging
zeal
within
the
various
protestant
denominations
a
remarkable
increase
of
fervor
and
of
success
in
this
department
of
christian
labor
has
been
witnessed
in
the
room
of
societies
for
this
purpose
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
in
in
europe
and
america
organizations
at
this
last
date
there
were
not
less
than
hundred
ordained
europeans
and
americans
employed
in
this
service
besides
a
great
number
of
assistants
both
foreign
and
native
the
native
converts
numbered
not
less
than
the
yearly
contributions
for
the
support
of
the
missions
increased
proportionately
in
british
contributions
alone
amounted
to
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
globe
is
now
covered
with
a
network
of
christian
outposts
the
following
passage
slightly
abbreviated
from
a
german
writer
presents
a
glowing
sketch
of
the
wide
extension
of
recent
missionary
labors
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
island
world
of
the
pacific
was
shut
against
the
gospel
but
england
and
america
have
attacked
those
lands
so
vigorously
in
all
directions
especially
through
native
workers
that
whole
groups
of
islands
even
the
whole
malayan
polynesia
is
almost
entirely
christianized
and
in
melanesia
and
micronesia
the
is
extended

is
being
labored
with
by
protestant
missionaries
japan
also
hungry
for
reform
by
granting
entrance
to
the
gospel
has
been
quickly
occupied
by
american
and
english
missionary
societies
and
already
after
so
little
labor
has
scores
of
evangelical
congregations
indeed
the
aboriginal
australians
have
in
some
places
been
reached
in
the
lands
of
islam
from
the
balkans
to
bagdad
from

to

there
have
been

stations
established
in
the
chief
places
for
christians
and
mohammedans
by
means
of

conducted
especially
by
americans
also
in

primitive
seat
of

palestine
from
bethlehem
to
tripoli
and
to
the
northern
boundaries
of

the

is
covered
by
a

here
and
there
an

africa

has
been
vigorously
attacked
in

from

yes
lately
even
to

by

britain
basel

at
times
checked
by

are
continually
pressing

in

in

the
sun
of
the

after
a
long
storm
has
burst
forth
over
madagascar
in
such
brightness
that
it
can
never
again
disappear
along
the
coasts
from
zanzibar
and
the
nile
even
to
abyssinia
have
been
established
and
powerful
assaults
made
by
the
scotch
english
and
recently
also
by
the
american
mission
and
civilization
into
the
very
heart
of
the
dark
continent
even
to

african
lakes
in

the
immense
plains
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
from
canada
over
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
ocean
have
not
only
been
visited
by
missionaries
but
have
been
opened
far
and
wide
to
the
gospel
through
rapidly
growing
indian
missions
in
the
united
states
hundreds
of
thousands
of
freedmen
have
been
gathered
into
evangelical
congregations
and
of
the
remnants
of
the
numerous
indian
tribes
some
at
least
have
been
converted
through
the
work
of
evangelization
by
various
churches
and
have
awakened
new
hope
for
the
future
in
central
america
and
the
west
indies
as
far
as
the
country
is
under
protestant
home
nations
the
net
of
evangelical
missions
has
been
thrown
from
island
to
island
even
to
the
mainland
in
honduras
upon
the
mosquito
coast
and
in
british
and
dutch
guiana
it
has
taken
even
firmer
hold
finally
the
lands
on
and
before
the
southern
extremity
of
the
continent
the
falkland
islands
terra
del
fuego
and
patagonia
received
the
first
light
through
the
south
american
missionary
society
in
london
and
recently
its
messengers
have
pushed
into
the
heart
of
the
land
and
are
rapidly
pressing
on
to
the
banks
of
the
great
amazon
to
the
indians
of
brazil
results
of
in
carrying
forward
missionary
work
during
the
nineteenth
century
the
bible
has
been
translated
into
numerous
languages
missionaries
as
in
the
early
days
of
the
church
have
reduced
the
languages
of
uncultivated
peoples
to
writing
and
made
the
beginning
of
native
literatures
schools
colleges
and
follow
in
the
path
of
the
preachers
the
contributions
made
to
philology
and
to
other
branches
of
science
by
missionary
preachers
and
explorers
are
of
high
value
as
far
as
the
number
of
converts
is
concerned
progress
has
been
more
rapid
as
was
the
case
in
the
first
christian
centuries
among
uncivilized
tribes
the
reception
of
christianity
is
more
slow
in
a
country
like
china
and
among
the
aryan
inhabitants
of
india
but
the
influence
exerted
by
missions
in
such
communities
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
number
of
converts
moreover
history
has
often
shown
that
in
the
spread
of
the
christian
religion
the
first
steps
are
the
most
slow
and
difficult
they
are
like
the
early
operations
in
a
siege
sir
writes
thus
statistical
facts
can
in
no
way
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
the
work
done
in
any
part
of
india
the
effect
is
enormous
where
there
has
not
been
a
single
avowed
conversion
the
teaching
of
christianity
amongst
a
hundred
and
sixty
millions
of
civilized
industrious
hindoos
and
mohammedans
in
india
is
effecting
changes
moral
social
and
political
which
for
extent
and
rapidity
in
effect
are
far
more
extraordinary
than
any
that
have
been
witnessed
in
modern
europe
of
the
same
tenor
is
an
opinion
expressed
in
strong
terms
by
sir
of
india
during
the
mutiny
of
and
a
most
competent
judge
it
is
worthy
of
remark
as
one
characteristic
of
the
christian
missions
of
the
recent
period
that
the
religions
of
the
nations
have
been
studied
more
thoroughly
and
the
true
and
praiseworthy
elements
in
them
have
been
better
appreciated
the
progress
made
in
the
past
encourages
the
hope
that
the
unity
of
mankind
a
unity
which
shall
be
the
crown
of
individual
and
national
development
will
one
day
be
reached
that
unity
of
mankind
in
loyal
fellowship
with
him
in
whose
image
man
was
made
is
the
community
of
which
the
ancient
stoic
vaguely
dreamed
and
which
the
apostles
of
christ
proclaimed
and
predicted
the
perfected
