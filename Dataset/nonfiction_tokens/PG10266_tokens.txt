man

said
the
old
greek
philosopher
man
perforce
has
taken
that
advice
to
heart
his
interest
is
his
own
species
in
the
cradle
he
begins
to
collect
observations
on
the
nature
of
the
queer
beings
about
him
as
he
grows
the
research
continues
amplifies
broadens
wisdom
he
measures
by
the
devastating
accuracy
of
the
data
he
accumulates
when
he
declares
he
knows
human
nature
consciously
cynical
maturity
speaks
doctor
of
human
nature
every
man
feels
himself
entitled
to
that
degree
from
the
university
of
disillusioning
experience
in
defense
of
his
claim
only
the
limitations
of
his
articulate
faculty
will
curb
the
vehemence
of
his
indictment
of
his
fellows
for
all
history
provides
the
material
literature
the
critique
biology
the
inexorable
logic
of
the
case
against
human
nature
the
historical
record
is
a
spectacle
of
man
destroying
man
a
collection
of
chapters
on
man
increasing
cruelty
to
man
limitations
of
time
and
space
have
been
shortened
and
eliminated
tools
of
production
have
been
multiplied
and
complicated
the
sources
of
energy
and
power
have
been
systematically
attacked
and
trapped
but
the
nature
of
man
has
remained
so
unchanged
that
clap
trap
about
progress
is
easy
target
for
the
barrage
of
every
cheap
pamphleteer
the
naturalist
probes
into
codes
of
conduct
systems
of
morality
structures
of
societies
variations
in
the
scales
of
value
that
individuals
races
and
nations
have
subjected
themselves
to
as
custom
law
and
religion
again
and
again
the
portrait
is
presented
of
man
preying
upon
man
of
cunning
a
parasite
upon
stupidity
and
of
predatory
strength
enslaving
the
weakling
intellect
until
finally
are
evoked
reactions
and
consequences
that
overtake
in
catastrophe
and
cataclysm
preyer
and
preyed
upon
alike
human
nature
is
but
part
of
the
magnificent
tree
of
beast
nature
man
is
linked
by
every
tie
of
blood
and
bone
and
cell
memories
with
his
brethren
of
the
sea
the
jungle
the
forest
and
the
fields
the
beast
is
a
seeker
of
freedom
but
a
seeker
for
his
own
ego
alone
and
the
satisfaction
of
his
own
instincts
only
thus
he
struggles
to
a
sort
of
freedom
which
makes
him
the
ishmael
of
the
universe
everyone
hand
against
him
as
his
own
hand
is
against
everyone
the
human
animal
has
achieved
no
advance
beyond
the
necessities
of
his
ancestors
nor
freed
himself
from
his
bondage
to
their
instincts
and
automatic
reflexes
and
so
the
sociologist
the
analyst
of
human
associations
turns
out
to
be
simply
the
historian
and
accountant
of
slaveries
yet
the
history
of
mankind
is
too
a
long
research
into
the
nature
of
the
machinery
of
freedom
all
recorded
history
indeed
is
but
the
documentation
of
that
research
viewed
thus
customs
laws
institutions
sciences
arts
codes
of
morality
and
honor
systems
of
life
become
inventions
come
upon
tried
out
standardized
established
until
scrapped
in
everlasting
search
for
more
and
more
perfect
means
of
freeing
body
and
soul
from
their
congenital
thralldom
to
a
host
of
innumerable
masters
indeed
the
history
of
all
life
vegetable
and
animal
of
bacillus
elephant
orchid
gorilla
as
well
as
of
man
is
the
history
of
a
searching
for
freedom
freedom
what
to
a
living
creature
is
freedom
how
completely
has
it
dominated
the
life
history
of
every
creature
that
ever
crawled
upon
the
earth
trace
our
cellular
pedigree
descend
our
family
tree
to
its
rootlets
our
amebic
ancestors
and
the
craving
for
more
freedom
is
manifest
in
the
soul
of
even
the
lowest
buried
in
darkness
and
slime
when
the
first
clever
bit
of
colloidal
ooze
protoplasm
as
the
ameba
protruded
a
bit
of
itself
as
a
pseudopod
it
achieved
a
new
freedom
for
accidentally
or
deliberately
it
created
for
itself
a
new
power
the
ability
to
go
directly
for
food
in
its
environment
instead
of
waiting
patiently
passively
as
the
plant
does
for
food
to
just
happen
along
therewith
developed
in
place
of
the
previous
quietist
pacifist
quaker
attitude
toward
its
surroundings
a
new
religion
a
new
tone
aggressive
predatory
careerist
that
adventure
was
a
great
step
forward
for
the
ameba
a
miracle
that
freed
it
forever
from
the
danger
of
death
by
starvation
but
latent
in
that
move
were
all
the
terrible
possibilities
of
the
tiger
the
alligator
the
wolf
and
all
the
varieties
of
predaceous
beast
and
plant
parasitism
and
slavery
the
device
that
enabled
the
ameba
to
change
its
position
in
space
of
its
own
will
and
so
increased
its
freedom
immeasureably
meant
the
generation
of
infinite
evil
pain
suffering
and
degradation
for
billions
in
the
womb
of
time
the
breeding
of
inferiority
human
history
being
a
continuation
of
vertebrate
history
is
full
of
similar
instances
the
invention
of
the
stock
company
for
example
furnished
a
certain
relative
freedom
to
hundreds
a
certain
amount
of
leisure
to
think
and
play
and
independence
to
travel
and
record
and
immunity
from
a
daily
routine
and
drudgery
in
turn
it
bore
fruit
in
miseries
and
horrors
multiplied
for
millions
like
those
of
the
child
lacemakers
of
england
who
were
dragged
from
their
beds
at
two
or
three
in
the
morning
to
work
until
ten
or
eleven
at
night
in
the
services
of
a
stock
company
a
corporation
is
said
to
have
no
soul
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
every
living
thing
has
no
conscience
throughout
the
living
world
from
ameba
to
man
parasitism
and
slavery
together
with
their
physical
and
spiritual
degeneracy
appear
as
the
after
effects
of
the
more
vital
individual
efforts
to
remain
alive
and
free
the
origins
of
slavery
may
be
seen
in
the
parasitisms
of
the
infectious
diseases
which
kill
man
the
change
from
parasitism
to
slavery
was
an
inevitable
step
of
creative
intelligence
in
the
transition
evolution
made
one
of
those
breaks
which
it
indulges
in
periodically
as
its
mode
of
progress
the
natural
effect
of
slavery
has
been
a
selection
of
two
sorts
of
individuals
along
the
lines
of
the
survival
of
the
adapted
it
has
tended
to
perpetuate
in
the
breed
the
qualities
of
the
strong
which
would
make
them
stronger
and
certain
qualities
in
the
weak
which
would
increase
their
weakness
for
parasitism
and
likewise
slavery
infallibly
entail
the
degradation
of
certain
structures
and
an
overgrowth
of
others
by
the
law
of
use
and
disuse
the
type
of
organ
which
would
function
normally
were
not
its
possessor
parasitic
in
that
function
invariably
degenerates
or
disappears
parasitic
insects
lose
their
wings
an
entire
anatomical
system
may
even
be
lost
so
the
tapeworm
which
feeds
upon
the
digested
food
present
in
the
intestines
of
its
host
has
no
alimentary
canal
of
its
own
because
it
needs
none
on
the
other
hand
the
organs
of
attack
and
combat
grow
by
a
constant
use
into
the
most
remarkable
of
efficient
weapons
in
human
society
the
process
continues
out
of
the
tapeworm
nature
the
tiger
nature
the
wolf
nature
the
simian
nature
human
nature
evolves
repeated
episodes
of
subjugation
and
suppression
mixed
with
countless
incidents
of
predaceous
cupidity
and
rapacity
have
made
man
what
he
is
today
indeed
by
a
sort
of
instinct
society
has
constructed
its
institutions
upon
empirical
observations
and
assumptions
agreeing
with
this
principle
the
deductions
concerning
human
nature
and
human
traits
that
an
interplanetary
visitor
would
draw
from
a
study
of
our
common
law
would
be
at
least
slightly
humiliating
to
our
incorrigible
pride
law
courts
codes
of
civil
contract
and
criminal
procedure
the
systems
of
subordination
in
armies
and
navies
castes
and
classes
men
and
women
employers
and
employees
teachers
and
pupils
parents
and
children
are
based
upon
the
fundamental
the
conservative
axiom
that
man
especially
the
common
plain
man
lincoln
phrase
is
a
being
incurably
lazy
stupid
dishonest
muddled
cowardly
greedy
restless
obsessed
with
a
low
cunning
and
a
selfish
callousness
and
insensibility
to
the
sufferings
of
his
fellow
creatures
animal
and
human
why
is
it
that
man
the
noblest
creature
of
creation
made
in
the
image
of
god
capable
of
the
flights
of
attainment
that
distinguish
a
christ
a
caesar
a
plato
a
shakespeare
a
shelley
a
newton
is
so
described
not
alone
by
hopeless
pessimists
like
koheleth
swift
and
mark
twain
but
by
the
common
law
the
common
opinion
the
common
assumptions
of
mankind
because
the
development
of
slavery
and
parasitism
in
human
society
the
subjection
of
the
weak
to
the
strong
the
dull
and
base
to
the
clever
and
headstrong
set
up
a
vicious
cycle
the
liberation
of
more
energy
for
the
making
of
more
and
more
slaves
and
the
propagation
of
slaves
and
slave
qualities
in
a
geometrically
increasing
proportion
this
might
be
called
the
law
of
for
the
qualities
that
i
have
named
as
man
own
characterization
of
himself
are
the
qualities
of
the
slave
and
the
nietzche
took
great
pains
to
repeat
ad
nauseam
that
these
qualities
were
the
qualities
of
the
slave
but
by
burdening
himself
with
the
hypothesis
evolved
from
his
inner
consciousness
that
the
slaves
imposed
from
below
a
morality
of
weakness
upon
their
masters
he
missed
the
really
obvious
process
by
which
slaves
beget
more
slaves
slavery
begets
more
slavery
and
the
becomes
universal
that
process
is
the
simple
action
of
physical
and
spiritual
reproduction
of
the
slaves
the
subnormal
begets
the
subnormal
the
inferior
begets
the
inferior
slavery
appeared
as
an
invention
of
the
it
was
a
brilliant
flash
of
genius
of
a
seeker
after
freedom
however
it
became
a
boomerang
by
multiplication
and
hereditary
transmission
the
inferiority
and
the
number
of
the
slaves
created
a
new
overwhelming
problem
for
the
superior
few
the
upper
crust
of
the
free
at
last
the
problem
grew
into
the
problem
of
problems
the
problem
of
government
that
threatened
all
freedom
as
an
epidemic
disease
threatens
even
the
most
healthy
government
at
first
organized
for
conquest
and
subjugation
had
to
change
its
character
until
it
became
more
and
more
to
consist
of
experiments
in
a
new
social
machinery
that
would
free
somebody
of
the
incubus
so
through
the
centuries
one
technique
of
liberty
after
another
was
tested
in
the
laboratory
of
experience
but
always
the
attempts
are
so
muddled
because
the
problem
is
not
grasped
muddledom
is
the
essence
of
the
and
the
essence
infiltrates
and
poisons
the
whole
atmosphere
in
which
the
think
and
act
kings
heads
are
chopped
off
a
whole
class
is
guillotined
reform
movements
come
and
go
the
masters
fight
every
inch
of
their
retreat
and
pile
stratagem
upon
stratagem
device
upon
device
to
retain
their
spoils
the
democratic
formula
of
freedom
for
all
comes
to
the
fore
so
at
last
universal
suffrage
is
introduced
as
the
panacea
freedom
seems
within
grasp
now
it
looks
as
if
a
method
and
an
objective
have
been
hit
upon
that
will
lead
both
the
free
and
the
enslaved
out
of
their
mutual
bondage
and
release
the
handcuffs
which
have
bound
them
together
all
the
trial
and
error
tests
to
which
history
had
subjected
institutions
appeared
to
culminate
in
the
formula
that
would
automatically
yield
liberty
the
french
wanted
a
little
more
and
added
equality
and
fraternity
the
americans
put
it
quite
definitely
as
the
formula
that
would
assist
the
pursuit
of
life
liberty
and
happiness
that
formula
is
the
of
the
to
be
sure
a
civilization
might
be
organized
for
the
breeding
and
the
glorification
of
the
supernormals
such
a
civilization
may
yet
have
to
be
tried
but
as
the
supernormals
as
we
know
them
today
are
merely
biologic
sports
in
a
sense
simple
accidents
no
one
can
tell
whether
they
will
turn
out
true
shots
or
just
flashes
in
the
pan
so
it
looks
the
better
course
to
stick
to
the
plan
of
nature
which
seems
to
be
the
raising
of
the
level
of
the
normals
and
the
gradual
increase
of
their
faculties
and
powers
what
the
statesman
is
up
against
under
the
terms
of
the
democratic
formula
the
problems
of
the
statesman
seem
to
become
enormously
simplified
that
is
if
one
assumes
that
he
has
worked
out
a
perfectly
clear
idea
of
what
a
democracy
means
and
what
the
normal
means
assuming
these
unassumables
his
problem
simplifies
into
the
definite
object
of
producing
and
developing
the
greatest
possible
number
of
normals
or
if
you
will
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
of
normal
lives
furthermore
you
then
begin
to
have
the
entirely
novel
possibility
in
the
world
some
sort
of
collective
effort
for
a
collective
purpose
beyond
the
personal
greeds
and
fears
factions
and
hatreds
so
the
state
instead
of
fulfilling
its
old
function
of
serving
as
the
tool
of
certain
powerful
individuals
latterly
known
as
the
big
men
might
be
transformed
into
an
instrument
toward
freedom
with
the
ideal
of
a
democracy
of
the
normals
ever
before
him
the
statesman
could
go
on
to
construct
and
modify
his
social
machinery
that
would
entail
the
satisfaction
not
alone
of
the
animal
needs
but
also
the
highest
aspirations
and
therefore
the
provision
of
the
finest
conditions
of
life
for
the
normal
those
most
favorable
stimulative
and
assistant
to
creative
activity
for
what
else
is
the
content
of
the
idea
of
freedom
without
committing
the
intellectual
sin
which
william
james
named
vicious
abstractionism
the
goal
of
the
clearest
progressive
and
liberal
thought
and
forces
of
the
twentieth
century
might
be
summed
up
as
this
freedom
in
a
democracy
of
normals
a
good
formula
which
coincides
with
the
technique
of
nature
in
the
evolution
of
species
a
fair
fight
a
who
are
unhandicapped
is
the
motto
of
natural
selection
where
civilization
shakes
hands
with
natural
instinct
what
but
the
happiest
of
results
can
be
expected
unfortunately
the
formula
in
human
society
possesses
an
heel
again
it
is
slavery
where
slavery
has
become
bred
into
the
bone
the
standard
of
the
normal
becomes
reduced
so
tremendously
that
the
average
of
normals
the
majority
are
hopelessly
inferior
in
effect
they
are
really
subnormal
so
the
ideal
of
our
ideal
statesman
is
bound
to
be
defeated
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
material
no
matter
how
interested
in
his
main
business
the
promotion
of
freedom
for
creative
activities
in
a
democracy
of
the
normals
he
is
bound
to
be
beaten
by
the
majority
consisting
of
subnormals
there
is
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
cater
to
the
minority
of
careerists
the
of
the
electorate
representing
superior
intelligence
the
intelligence
tests
employed
in
the
war
showed
that
and
also
that
per
cent
of
the
examined
or
about
one
half
the
total
population
had
a
mental
capacity
or
natural
ability
that
would
never
develop
beyond
the
stage
normal
to
a
child
they
are
doomed
to
remain
forever
subnormal
the
careerists
as
the
abnormals
the
careerists
are
those
who
practice
the
careerist
religion
the
careerist
religion
is
the
religion
par
excellence
of
modernity
someone
once
said
with
the
perfect
candor
of
the
north
american
that
america
is
the
land
of
opportunity
he
meant
that
america
is
the
land
of
the
careerist
or
as
it
has
also
been
put
it
is
the
land
of
the
man
on
the
make
the
careerist
or
the
man
on
the
make
is
of
a
thousand
genera
and
species
varieties
and
subvarieties
with
transition
links
between
one
finds
him
at
every
level
of
society
excepting
a
negligible
minority
the
feminine
career
of
today
as
of
the
last
ten
thousand
years
of
the
race
history
consists
in
the
acquisition
of
a
husband
after
that
she
is
so
identified
with
him
that
her
own
life
as
something
distinct
individual
and
unique
becomes
blurred
and
then
completely
erased
the
feminine
careerist
the
careeristina
if
you
will
is
a
definite
type
consider
the
unimportance
of
a
collective
purpose
to
the
woman
whose
career
is
the
mate
and
then
the
mate
career
all
the
kinks
and
twists
of
the
feminine
mind
resulting
from
the
necessities
of
that
fundamental
primary
problem
would
form
a
multitudinous
and
interesting
list
the
most
successful
careeristinas
are
the
absolutely
unconscious
ones
because
they
are
not
passively
besieged
nor
actively
bombarded
by
any
doubts
as
to
what
they
want
they
play
their
game
exceedingly
well
as
do
not
the
and
revoltees
that
form
no
small
percentage
of
the
newest
women
for
a
number
of
women
the
feminist
movement
has
been
an
attempt
to
break
away
from
the
traditions
of
the
and
to
strike
a
line
of
can
the
careeristina
instinct
the
fruit
of
the
practice
of
so
many
generations
be
uprooted
by
the
good
intentions
of
a
mere
statesman
but
the
masculine
careerist
is
a
marvelous
creature
he
is
a
biologic
sport
an
abnormal
variation
new
york
is
the
place
to
watch
and
study
him
in
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
you
can
observe
him
climbing
climbing
climbing
precisely
as
an
ant
climbs
a
tree
nothing
can
really
discourage
or
sway
him
from
his
chosen
path
if
he
is
not
getting
on
financially
he
is
getting
on
socially
or
he
is
using
the
one
method
of
advance
to
help
him
with
the
other
how
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
greatest
advantage
is
determined
for
and
taken
by
him
is
a
fascinating
process
the
careerist
instinct
the
inherited
flair
for
a
career
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
instincts
of
or
because
they
are
utterly
different
indeed
the
careerist
instinct
is
often
their
direct
antagonist
clashing
with
and
dominating
them
the
making
of
the
career
involves
the
distortion
the
mutilation
degradation
degeneration
or
even
the
complete
suppression
of
the
true
personality
but
it
is
all
instinctive
to
consider
the
life
of
the
careerist
as
an
expression
of
instinct
will
explain
too
the
success
of
so
many
who
have
no
inner
awareness
of
what
they
want
these
go
straight
for
the
career
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
without
doubt
or
hesitation
just
as
they
go
for
the
respiration
business
as
soon
as
they
are
born
then
there
is
the
ordinarily
the
careerist
is
rather
obvious
easily
recognizable
with
diaphanous
motives
and
conduct
but
there
is
another
and
rarer
bird
the
careerist
of
talent
even
the
careerist
of
genius
whom
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
through
clever
and
brainy
he
may
be
a
good
all
around
trifler
or
his
specific
gift
for
some
line
of
achievement
may
make
him
more
effective
there
is
nothing
he
may
not
call
himself
conservative
liberal
progressive
or
radical
often
he
is
an
agnostic
about
social
and
political
affairs
and
problems
which
passes
for
the
indecision
of
the
open
mind
and
is
quite
handy
to
render
him
all
things
to
all
men
but
perpetually
the
underlying
careerist
instinct
drives
him
to
use
all
men
and
women
all
ideas
and
movements
and
forces
he
comes
in
contact
with
for
his
own
personal
advancement
just
as
the
slave
making
instinct
guides
the
red
ant
in
all
its
activities
to
procure
its
captives
ideas
do
not
make
a
hero
out
of
him
but
he
makes
heroes
of
ideas
because
they
serve
him
in
his
ascent
because
he
is
the
most
subtle
the
most
complex
and
the
most
deceptive
type
of
careerist
he
is
the
most
dangerous
to
the
adventure
and
speculation
in
intellect
which
mankind
is
to
say
that
he
is
a
wolf
in
sheepskin
is
to
be
unjust
to
him
since
he
is
most
successful
when
he
is
most
unaware
of
his
own
charlatanry
he
is
most
sincere
when
he
is
most
insincere
and
most
truthful
when
he
lies
best
a
little
of
hypocrisy
is
a
corrupting
thing
much
of
it
completely
incompatible
with
the
most
successful
careerism
tartuffe
is
always
applauded
by
the
world
when
he
plays
hamlet
if
he
really
believes
in
himself
as
hamlet
and
as
all
he
has
to
do
if
he
is
at
all
talented
is
to
look
into
his
glass
and
see
himself
in
the
part
he
carries
it
off
very
well
why
the
statesman
fails
slaves
and
careerists
subnormals
and
abnormals
are
the
important
elements
of
the
constituency
of
every
modern
statesman
the
financial
and
social
careerists
as
business
men
professionals
artists
publicists
presidents
of
countries
politicians
philosophers
dominate
his
outlook
his
plans
his
horizon
the
slaves
the
inferiors
the
subnormals
exist
merely
to
be
exploited
by
them
no
one
questions
the
causes
of
the
multiplicity
of
them
no
one
asks
why
there
are
so
many
little
lives
for
a
fundamentally
minded
statesman
the
control
of
the
production
of
the
careerist
why
he
is
produced
and
how
he
may
be
prevented
becomes
the
primary
problem
of
his
art
well
you
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
that
is
human
nature
the
evils
of
human
nature
there
is
the
perpetual
answer
to
be
repeated
by
our
clever
editors
unto
eternity
you
can
not
get
away
from
human
nature
it
is
human
nature
to
be
a
careerist
it
is
human
nature
to
put
the
immediate
triumphs
of
the
self
and
its
pleasures
above
the
more
indirect
the
more
remote
and
distant
benefits
of
a
great
wonderful
free
community
we
are
all
careerists
in
so
far
as
democracy
has
succeeded
as
a
form
it
has
persisted
because
there
was
in
it
for
the
common
man
the
promise
of
his
getting
more
out
of
life
that
way
than
any
other
way
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
others
the
myopia
of
such
crude
selfishness
continues
to
determine
his
politics
to
this
very
day
and
so
he
proceeds
to
vote
for
favors
bestowed
and
patronage
past
or
potential
that
is
when
he
does
not
throw
his
ballot
away
altogether
into
the
fire
of
family
habit
sectional
inertia
or
race
prejudice
again
you
say
that
is
human
nature
it
is
human
nature
for
us
to
be
narrow
to
be
confined
within
the
circle
of
personal
thought
and
desire
without
imagination
for
the
beyond
so
the
calf
is
limited
in
its
wanderings
to
the
radius
of
the
rope
by
which
it
is
tethered
the
servile
soul
will
always
be
submissive
and
docile
greedy
and
stupid
what
else
could
you
expect
from
the
descendant
of
the
solitary
beast
who
once
lived
for
thousands
of
years
in
caves
without
servility
of
the
soul
without
chains
for
the
spirit
of
the
wild
animal
against
the
world
men
could
never
have
been
driven
to
live
together
for
hours
in
communities
the
conception
of
human
quality
out
of
which
all
social
machinery
has
been
devised
and
built
is
a
conception
of
slave
quality
and
careerist
quality
as
we
are
all
caught
in
the
net
as
the
unconscious
memories
of
our
slave
and
careerist
ancestors
flow
in
our
blood
and
echo
in
our
cells
all
we
can
do
is
accept
it
and
work
with
it
human
nature
is
an
incurable
disease
like
jehovah
definition
of
himself
it
is
it
has
been
and
ever
will
be
everywhere
the
same
always
the
same
forever
the
same
there
is
no
way
out
poor
human
nature
all
of
these
strictures
upon
poor
human
nature
are
exceedingly
delightful
to
our
careerists
every
unpleasant
social
fact
every
outrage
to
our
best
instincts
every
exhibition
of
incapacity
incompetency
inefficiency
indifference
every
example
of
negligence
is
pardoned
as
an
effect
of
that
universal
sin
human
nature
take
the
case
of
the
statesman
and
the
diplomats
who
failed
to
prevent
the
great
war
though
they
saw
it
coming
for
years
and
who
should
therefore
all
entente
as
well
as
german
american
as
well
as
japanese
be
indicted
for
their
criminal
negligence
precisely
as
a
physician
would
be
for
failure
to
report
and
stop
the
spread
of
an
epidemic
disease
all
these
crimes
of
omission
and
commission
are
excused
on
the
plea
that
it
was
all
due
to
human
nature
and
that
what
can
be
blamed
on
human
nature
in
general
can
be
blamed
on
no
one
in
particular
poor
human
nature
flagellated
on
every
hand
what
are
we
to
do
with
it
why
is
the
careerist
so
numerous
and
ubiquitous
why
does
the
infiltrate
like
a
cancer
the
soul
of
society
with
its
black
fluid
is
freedom
the
divine
idea
nothing
but
the
toy
of
an
orator
to
the
majority
a
distant
star
in
the
night
to
a
helpless
minority
yet
the
instinct
to
freedom
the
appetite
for
freedom
flickers
through
the
centuries
as
a
fitful
flame
though
snuffed
out
by
every
gust
of
class
passion
every
wind
of
mob
resentment
and
every
storm
of
national
jealousy
though
the
inferior
subnormals
multiply
into
great
sheep
majorities
and
the
careerists
like
napoleon
morbid
variants
involve
millions
in
their
disease
the
idea
of
freedom
persists
obstinately
have
we
any
reason
for
regarding
it
as
other
than
an
illusion
if
freedom
is
an
illusion
we
must
admit
the
doom
of
democracy
and
no
wagnerian
crashes
of
orchestration
mitigate
the
tragedy
of
the
scene
as
our
eyes
are
opened
to
the
twilight
of
our
new
gods
for
what
other
social
methods
are
there
left
to
us
in
the
struggle
against
barriers
upon
human
aspiration
for
perfect
satisfactions
it
looks
as
though
every
other
method
has
failed
us
in
the
past
refined
aristocracies
and
benevolent
despotisms
have
failed
as
miserably
as
our
democracies
are
now
failing
and
as
we
are
sure
crude
anarchism
and
communism
would
their
inferiority
has
thrown
them
on
the
scrap
heap
as
for
our
present
ways
of
government
as
a
permanent
method
the
storage
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
clever
few
war
burns
in
the
lesson
of
how
little
the
careerist
regards
either
the
subnormal
or
supernormal
he
condemns
them
all
sooner
or
later
to
wholesale
slavery
and
carnage
is
man
then
never
to
be
the
architect
of
his
own
destiny
are
we
to
surrender
our
faith
in
the
future
of
our
kind
to
the
spectacle
of
a
miserable
species
sentenced
by
its
own
nature
to
we
thought
to
rise
upon
the
wings
of
knowledge
and
beauty
lured
by
the
mysteries
of
color
and
the
magic
of
design
and
the
might
of
the
intellect
and
its
words
that
have
transfigured
life
into
the
greatest
adventure
ever
attempted
in
time
and
space
but
we
find
ourselves
merely
another
experiment
intricate
and
rather
long
drawn
out
to
be
sure
with
marvelous
pyrotechnics
magnificent
effects
here
and
there
but
bound
to
eliminate
itself
in
the
end
to
make
stuff
for
the
museums
of
the
real
conqueror
of
the
stars
yet
to
come
we
are
condemned
to
be
classed
with
the
dodo
and
the
mammoth
by
the
coming
discoverer
of
an
escape
from
the
slave
and
careerist
and
so
let
us
resign
ourselves
to
fate
let
us
eat
of
the
humble
bread
of
the
stoic
consolation
in
the
face
of
the
mocking
laughter
of
the
gods
let
us
admit
that
mind
in
man
has
unconsciously
but
irretrievably
willed
its
own
what
remains
for
us
except
to
beat
our
breasts
and
proclaim
so
be
it
o
lord
so
be
it
man
as
a
transient
yet
true
as
it
is
that
the
human
animal
has
achieved
no
advance
beyond
the
necessities
of
his
ancestors
nor
freed
himself
from
his
bondage
to
their
instincts
and
automatic
reflexes
is
there
no
way
out
anywhere
is
there
perhaps
some
ground
for
hope
and
consolation
in
the
thought
that
we
of
the
twentieth
century
no
longer
see
ourselves
man
as
something
final
and
fixed
darwin
changed
fate
from
a
static
sphinx
into
a
chameleon
flux
just
as
certainly
as
man
has
arisen
from
something
whose
bones
alone
remain
as
reminders
of
his
existence
we
are
persuaded
man
himself
is
to
be
the
ancestor
of
another
creature
differing
as
much
from
him
as
he
from
the
chimpanzi
and
who
if
he
will
not
supplant
and
wipe
him
out
will
probably
segregate
him
and
allow
him
to
play
out
his
existence
in
cage
cities
the
vision
of
this
or
is
really
about
as
helpful
to
us
as
the
water
of
the
oasis
mirage
is
to
the
lost
dying
of
thirst
in
the
desert
the
outcries
of
the
wretched
and
miserable
the
lived
din
an
unmanageable
tinnitus
in
our
ears
like
god
it
may
be
but
a
large
vague
idea
toward
which
we
grope
to
snuggle
up
against
it
seems
implicit
in
the
doctrines
of
evolution
but
how
do
we
know
that
in
man
the
spiral
of
life
has
not
reached
its
apex
and
that
now
even
now
the
vortices
of
its
descent
are
not
beginning
how
do
we
know
that
the
is
to
be
a
superman
and
not
a
subman
how
can
we
dare
to
hope
that
the
is
to
give
birth
to
an
heir
fine
and
free
and
superior
we
do
not
know
and
we
have
every
indication
and
induction
for
the
most
oppositely
contrary
conclusions
life
has
blundered
supremely
in
while
making
brains
its
darling
forgetting
or
helplessly
surrendering
to
the
egoisms
of
alimentation
so
it
has
spawned
a
conflict
between
its
organs
and
a
consequent
impasse
in
which
the
lower
centres
drive
the
higher
pitilessly
into
devising
means
and
instruments
for
the
suicide
of
the
whole
as
war
shows
plainly
to
the
most
stupidly
gross
imagination
the
germs
of
our
own
as
a
species
saturate
our
blood
the
probability
looms
with
almost
the
certainty
of
a
syllogistic
deduction
that
such
will
be
the
outcome
to
our
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
of
pain
upon
earth
in
the
face
of
that
speculations
upon
a
comet
or
gaseous
emanations
hitting
the
planet
or
the
sun
growing
cold
become
babyish
fancies
how
clearly
the
possibility
is
pointed
in
the
discussions
about
the
use
in
the
next
war
of
bacterial
bombs
containing
the
bacilli
of
cholera
plague
dysentery
and
many
others
what
influenza
did
in
destroying
millions
they
can
repeat
a
thousand
times
and
ten
thousand
times
what
else
the
laboratories
will
bring
forth
of
which
no
man
dreams
in
the
way
of
destructive
agents
acting
at
long
distance
upon
huge
masses
and
over
any
extent
of
territory
is
presaged
in
that
single
example
but
besides
thus
willing
by
an
inner
necessity
its
own
annihilation
life
in
the
very
structure
and
machinery
of
its
being
seems
caught
into
the
entanglements
of
an
inescapable
net
an
bondage
it
can
never
rip
to
flee
and
remake
itself
into
the
immortal
image
that
is
its
god
and
so
there
go
by
the
board
the
last
alleviations
of
those
unbeatable
optimists
who
would
soothe
their
aching
souls
with
at
least
the
drop
of
comfort
that
if
man
is
a
mortal
species
with
not
the
slightest
prospect
of
a
continuing
immortality
not
to
mention
a
glorious
future
and
destiny
there
are
others
man
after
all
may
be
simply
a
bad
habit
life
will
succeed
in
shaking
off
no
philosophy
or
religion
can
afford
to
be
anthropocentric
merely
it
must
include
all
life
and
all
living
things
to
which
we
are
there
are
other
species
or
latent
species
to
take
up
the
torch
that
burned
poor
homo
sapiens
and
ascend
the
heights
the
ant
and
bee
may
yet
mutate
along
certain
lines
that
would
make
them
the
masters
of
the
universe
but
no
matter
what
species
or
variety
gets
the
upper
hand
in
the
struggle
for
survival
and
power
the
implications
of
the
qualities
necessary
to
victory
in
conflicts
of
individual
separate
pieces
of
protoplasm
will
be
there
besides
life
is
always
begotten
of
life
that
is
why
synthetic
protoplasm
is
nothing
but
a
phrase
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
something
alive
possessed
of
the
property
of
remembering
that
is
not
possessed
of
a
store
of
past
experiences
you
can
no
more
think
of
getting
rid
of
these
unconscious
memories
of
protoplasm
than
you
can
think
of
getting
rid
of
the
wetness
of
water
they
are

the

the
cold
lone

the

may
haunt
us
to

the

the
ant
too
have
woven
inextricably
into
the

of
their

the

sooner

would
send
their

even
when
evolved

the
pitch
of
perfection
to
elaborating
the
murdering

that
are
apparently

protoplasm
making

they

add
to
this
unsloughable
remembrance
of

for

for

the
secretive
consciousness
of
its
present
needs
every
living
thing
as
against
every
other
living
thing
is
obsessed
with
as
a
peregrinating
finite
spatially
limited
being
it
is
separated
from
all
other
living
beings
by
inorganic
dead
masses
and
yet
driven
to
contact
with
them
by
a
fundamental
impulse
to
assimilate
them
into
itself
and
make
them
part
of
itself
that
assimilatory
urge
is
present
in
every
activity
from
coarse
ingestion
as

to
the
moral
metabolism
of
the
who
would
influence

to

fate
and
in
effect
the
history
of

resembles
the
life
history
of
the
smallest
things
we
know
of
the
electrons
and
the
largest
the
great
suns
and
stars
of

the

perhaps
as

joins

elements
of
an
increasing
complexity
through
stages
of
a
relative
stability
like
lead
or
gold
until
it
reaches
the
stage
of
integration
which
wills
its
own
disintegration
that
we
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
with
proper
awe
and
reverence
as
radium
and
we
are
told
that
nebulae
wander
until
they
collide
and
give
birth
to
stars
stars
wander
and
collide
and
give

to
nebulae
life
begins
as
a
quivering
colloid
goes
on
painfully
to
build
a
brain
which
automatically
refines
itself
to
the
point
of
discovering
and
using
the
most
efficient
methods
of
destroying

and
by
a
boomerang
effect
itself
fate
the
conception
of
fate
was
a
greek
idea
the
classic
formula
for
tragedy
the
struggle
of
man
with
the
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
within
him
and
without
that
is
so
utterly
beyond
his
grasp
and
ken
or
power
to
modify
originated
with
them
but
they
must
also
be
given
the
credit
for
having
conceived
an
idea
and
started
a
process
which
at
first
slowly
and
gropingly
now
slipping
and
falling
torn
and
bleeding
among
the
thorns
of
the
dark
forest
of
human
motives
presently
goes
on
with
a
firmer
more
practiced
more
confident
step
to
emerge
into
the
light
as
the
deliberate
conqueror
of
fate
that
this
is
science
science
began
with
the
adventures
of
speculators
who
revolted
against
religious
cosmogonies
and
superstitions
sceptics
concerning
the
knowledge
that
was
the
accepted
monopoly
of
the
priesthood
must
have
existed
in
the
oldest
civilization
we
know
anything
of
more
than
thousand
years
ago
the
aurignacians
but
it
was
to
the
greeks
that
we
owe
that
amalgamation
of
curiosity
delivered
of
fear
that
merger
of
systematic
research
and
critical
thinking
untrammelled
by
social
inhibitions
which
is
the
essence
of
modern
science
out
of
them
has
come
the
great
tree
of
knowledge
of
our
time
which
is
too
the
only
ygdrasil
of
life
undying
because
it
lives
upon
successive
generations
of
human
brain
cells
science
as
the
pursuit
of
the
real
began
with
very
small
things
by
men
with
very
small
intentions
inventories
collections
of
isolated
data
something
permanent
for
the
mind
out
of
the
flux
of
transient
sensations
little
tracks
and
foot
paths
in
the
jungle
of
phenomena
were
their
goal
with
no
sense
of
themselves
as
the
mightiest
of
cultivating
humility
toward
their
material
at
any
rate
the
little
men
ploughed
their
little
fields
striking
the
oil
of
a
great
generalization
or
classification
or
explanation
with
no
fanfare
of
trumpets
first
as
freaks
and
cranks
then
as
scholars
and
pedants
then
protected
and
perhaps
stimulated
under
the
competitive
royal
patronage
as
societies
and
academies
they
prepared
for
the
harvest
comparing
them
to
pioneer
farmers
sowing
an
undeveloped
territory
is
really
totally
inadequate
and
inaccurate
for
the
most
part
they
were
like
coral
makers
laboriously
constructing
with
no
vision
certainly
no
sustained
vision
of
the
whole
to
the
practical
men
of
affairs
the
shopkeepers
and
traders
the
and
the
soldiers
and
sailors
the
statesmen
and
politicians
the
people
who
specialized
in
maneuvering
human
beings
and
materials
they
were
for
this
futile
devotion
to
abstract
knowledge
marked
ridiculous
and
absurd
weaklings
mollycoddles
babies
not
to
be
trusted
with
the
demands
and
dangers
of
public
life
but
it
so
happened
remarkably
late
in
history
that
with
the
discovery
of
the
possibilities
of
coal
there
was
a
great
boom
in
the
demand
for
industrial
machinery
at
the
same
time
there
were
thrown
up
the
most
marvelous
advances
in
physics
and
chemistry
recurring
war
became
not
the
clashes
of
mercenary
armies
but
the
catapulting
of
whole
nations
at
each
other
new
destructive
devices
out
of
the
laboratories
were
raised
into
the
commandants
of
the
course
of
history
then
science
acquired
prestige
science
as
king
science
as
power
looms
as
the
great
new
figure
the
overshadowing
novel
factor
in
practical
statesmanship
unlike
the
factor
x
in
the
traditional
equation
it
is
the
known
factor
par
excellence
the
factor
by
which
the
value
of
all
the
other
factors
of
human
life
will
be
ascertained
and
solved
as
knowledge
of
the
conditions
determining
all
life
it
stands
as
the
courageous
david
of
the
race
against
the
goliath
territory
of
the
uncontrollable
and
the
inevitable
even
the
unknowable
human
history
resolves
itself
into
the
drama
science
contra
fate
quite
a
change
from
the
vaudeville
show
of
the
restless
personal
ambitions
of
vindictive
fools
and
greedy
scoundrels
the
mischief
and
adventures
of
geniuses
and
licensed
rogues
that
have
been
figures
of
the
prologue
the
future
of
science
has
become
the
future
of
the
race
so
much
of
an
inkling
of
the
truth
is
beginning
to
be
appreciated
that
is
ordinarily
taken
to
mean
that
the
process
by
which
the
wessex
man
became
the
new
york
and
london
man
the
accumulation
of
accidental
discoveries
and
inspired
inventions
of
scattered
individuals
will
go
on
providing
a
succession
of
marvels
and
miracles
for
the
careerist
and
his
retinue
not
only
is
he
to
be
entertained
and
served
by
them
but
any
commercial
value
will
also
be
exploited
by
him
the
natural
wonders
of
the
laboratories
have
taken
the
place
of
the
supernatural
absurdities
of
the
medieval
mind
as
a
fillip
for
the
imagination
of
the
man
in
the
street
even
spiritualism
apes
the
technique
of
the
physicist
the
credulity
of
reporters
alone
concerning
developments
in
surgery
for
example
is
incredible
there
is
enough
rot
published
daily
for
a
brief
to
be
made
out
against
the
idolatry
of
science
the
religion
of
science
science
also
as
a
religion
as
a
faith
to
bind
men
together
as
a
substitute
for
the
moribund
old
mythologies
and
theologies
which
kept
them
sundered
is
commencing
to
be
talked
of
in
a
more
serious
tone
the
may
have
forced
upon
him
may
welcome
the
honors
of
the
priest
though
he
pose
as
the
humble
slave
of
nature
and
her
secrets
presently
the
foundations
and
institutes
which
coexist
with
the
cathedrals
and
churches
just
as
once
the
new
christian
chapels
and
congregations
stood
side
by
side
with
pagan
temples
and
heathen
shrines
may
oust
their
rivals
and
assume
the
monopoly
of
ritual
should
its
spirit
remain
fine
and
clear
should
it
maintain
the
glorious
promise
of
its
dawn
should
its
high
priests
realize
the
perpetually
widening
intimations
of
its
universal
triumph
and
escape
the
ossification
that
has
overtaken
all
young
and
hopeful
things
and
institutions
the
real
foundation
for
a
future
of
the
species
would
be
laid
and
so
its
ultimate
suicide
prevented
the
time
has
gone
by
however
for
any
complacent
assurance
that
the
redemption
of
mankind
is
to
be
attained
by
a
new
religion
of
words
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
damnation
or
salvation
of
an
individual
has
often
been
determined
by
a
religious
crisis
in
which
the
magic
of
words
have
worked
their
witchery
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
a
psychic
conversion
will
effect
an
actual
revolution
in
the
whole
way
of
living
of
the
victim
or
patient
as
you
like
it
william
james
in
his
varieties
of
religious
experience
established
that
pretty
definitely
when
it
comes
to
groups
races
nations
the
outlook
is
wholly
different
there
is
a
conflict
of
so
many
and
diverse
habits
and
interests
beliefs
and
prejudices
that
hope
for
some
common
merely
intellectual
solvent
for
all
of
them
is
rather
forlorn
if
at
all
the
resolution
of
the
conflict
will
come
by
a
pooling
of
actual
powers
and
interests
in
which
the
religion
of
science
will
play
the
great
part
of
the
liberator
of
mankind
from
the
whole
system
of
torments
that
have
made
the
way
of
all
flesh
a
path
of
rocks
along
which
a
manacled
prisoner
crawls
to
his
doom
science
and
human
nature
science
has
a
future
the
religion
of
science
has
a
future
can
science
assure
us
that
human
nature
in
spite
of
its
origins
holds
the
possibility
of
a
genuine
transformation
of
its
texture
can
fate
stranglehold
upon
us
be
broken
there
will
be
certainly
a
tremendous
an
overwhelming
increase
in
the
general
stock
of
informations
we
call
physics
and
chemistry
and
biology
an
abundance
of
new
comforts
novel
sensations
fresh
experiences
and
devices
that
will
thrill
or
heal
will
follow
of
course
in
their
wake
the
religion
of
science
will
infiltrate
and
penetrate
and
permeate
by
its
capillary
action
the
barbaric
superstitions
the
ridiculous
rites
the
unsanitary
insanities
of
our
social
systems
but
what
about
the
poor
human
soul
itself
with
its
inherent
vices
and
virtues
its
fears
and
indulgences
audacities
and
nobilities
jealousies
shames
blunders
incurable
likes
cravings
and
diseases
can
science
change
the
texture
of
the
slave
and
careerist
if
they
represent
the
subnormal
and
the
abnormal
what
about
the
becky
sharps
the
mark
tapleys
and
tom
pinches
not
to
speak
of
the
nicholas
nicklebys
and
the
hamlets
the
micawbers
and
the
falstaffs
what
future
have
they
as
they
recur
in
the
generations
indeed
does
not
the
very
fact
of
their
recurrence
of
them
and
of
the
hundreds
of
other
types
and
temperaments
point
implacably
to
the
conclusion
to
which
the
historian
the
philosopher
and
the
biologist
have
driven
us
that
in
the
grip
of
an
endless
chain
of
pasts
the
human
soul
has
no
future
that
may
appear
an
irrelevant
an
immaterial
and
an
incompetent
question
to
our
men
of
business
and
affairs
human
nature
as
fallen
angel
or
ape
parvenu
has
always
looked
upon
itself
as
fixed
for
eternity
human
nature
never
changes
and
is
everywhere
and
always
will
be
the
same
as
a
man
is
built
bred
in
the
bone
these
are
the
axioms
of
our
social
and
economic
euclids
indeed
man
assuming
that
his
nature
is
as
uncontrollable
as
the
course
of
the
stars
has
limited
his
research
into
the
substance
of
freedom
to
a
groping
for
an
understanding
of
the
adequate
external
conditions
of
liberty
thus
he
set
himself
another
of
the
insoluble
problems
he
seems
to
delight
in
by
neglecting
the
most
important
factor
in
the
equation
yet
the
invisible
soul
of
man
ignored
as
a
variable
varying
quantity
has
upset
all
societies
and
constitutions
and
all
schemes
of
bondage
as
well
as
of
freedom
for
freedom
it
becomes
obvious
as
soon
as
it
is
clearly
stated
is
sheer
impossibility
until
the
internal
conditions
of
his
nature
are
ascertained
and
the
way
paved
for
their
control
a
simple
illustration
of
the
working
of
this
principle
is
supplied
by
our
democracies
grossly
pretenders
how
can
a
democracy
be
possible
without
a
knowledge
of
the
control
of
the
individually
and
socially
subnormal
who
since
they
offer
themselves
to
exploitation
by
the
careerists
prove
themselves
the
weak
links
in
the
chain
of
with
an
equal
opportunity
for
all
that
is
the
democratic
ideal
in
what
does
the
equality
or
inequality
of
men
consist
just
what
are
the
qualities
necessary
for
successful
competition
or
if
you
will
of
man
with
his
and
how
and
why
do
they
operate
no
freedom
independent
of
the
servile
repetitions
of
history
and
heredity
is
conceivable
until
these
inquiries
have
been
elaborately
carried
out
toward
a
certain
working
finality
the
promises
of
eugenics
there
are
to
be
sure
the
claims
and
assertions
and
negative
achievements
of
the
youngest
of
the
sciences
eugenics
they
are
invincible
optimists
the
eugenists
it
is
perhaps
a
case
of
a
virtue
born
of
necessity
thus
francis
galton
in
the
preface
to
the
bible
of
eugenics
his
essays
on
hereditary
genius
declares
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
history
of
domestic
animals
or
in
that
of
evolution
to
make
us
doubt
that
a
race
of
sane
men
may
be
formed
who
shall
be
as
much
superior
mentally
and
morally
to
the
modern
european
as
the
modern
european
is
to
the
lowest
of
the
negro
races
high
hopes
beat
in
this
declaration
but
galton
could
not
have
foreseen
that
the
signing
of
a
scrap
of
paper
by
one
of
the
modern
europeans
would
let
loose
all
the
other
modern
europeans
in
a
pandemonium
of
horrors
the
lowest
of
the
negro
races
could
not
but
envy
as
a
masterpiece
of
its
kind
it
seemed
to
be
suspiciously
easy
for
him
to
accept
an
excuse
to
slide
down
the
dizzy
height
he
had
climbed
from
the
african
level
the
eugenists
would
put
their
trust
in
the
encouraged
breeding
of
the
best
and
the
compulsory
sterility
of
the
rest
but
what
is
the
best
and
who
are
the
best
and
where
will
you
find
them
when
they
are
not
inextricably
emulsified
with
the
worst
it
a
long
long
way
to
the
day
of
a
segregating
out
and
in
of
mendelian
besides
this
is
a
strange
world
of
choices
nobody
is
to
be
considered
worthy
of
parenthood
until
he
has
fallen
in
love
properly
nobody
who
would
permit
an
outsider
decision
as
to
when
he
was
properly
in
love
would
be
worth
thirty
cents
as
a
parent
there
is
the
ultimate
dilemma
of
the
eugenist
the
dilemma
which
destroys
forever
the
dream
of
a
control
of
parenthood
from
the
point
of
view
of
merely
psychic
values
new
psychology
there
are
the
claims
and
outcries
and
promises
of
the
psychologists
the
specialists
in
the
probing
of
the
human
soul
and
human
nature
in
our
time
the
demand
for
a
dynamic
psychology
of
process
and
becoming
psychology
with
an
energy
in
it
has
split
them
into
two
schools
the
emphasizers
of
instinct
and
the
subconscious
the
mcdougallians
and
the
pleaders
for
sex
and
the
unconscious
the
freudians
a
synthesis
between
these
two
groups
is
latent
since
their
differences
are
those
of
horizon
merely
for
the
mcdougallians
look
upon
the
world
with
two
eyes
and
see
it
whole
and
broad
the
freudians
see
through
their
telescope
a
circular
field
and
exclaim
that
they
behold
the
universe
it
is
true
that
they
own
a
telescope
but
what
has
either
to
offer
our
quest
for
light
on
the
future
of
the
species
nothing
very
much
thus
to
turn
to
the
disciples
of
mcdougall
in
a
recent
volume
entitled
human
nature
and
its
remaking
professor
william
ernest
hocking
of
harvard
contends
that
man
all
axioms
about
his
nature
to
the
contrary
is
but
a
creature
of
habit
and
so
the
most
plastic
of
living
things
since
habit
is
and
by
the
of
the
habits
of
the
race
will
the
new
freedom
be
reborn
it
sounds
old
very
old
and
pathetic
because

are
held
up
as
the
ultimate
pulling

forces
of
human

but
is
the
problem
solved
is
not
human
nature
primarily
animal
nature
and
do
we
so
thoroughly
understand
this
animal
nature
does
not
all
this
material
of
freudianism
consist
of
variations
upon
social
burdens
imposed
on
the
original
human
nature
to
be
sure
at
every
moment
of

choices
have
to

made
and
choice
involves
the
clashing
of
instincts
and
motives
with
victory
for
one
or
some
and
defeat
for
the
others
but
the
freudian
material
per
se
the
sex
material
is
it
not
merely
the
of
a
certain
state
of
society
a
sane
society
would
eliminate
nearly
all
of
freudian
disease
but
still
have
original
human
nature
upon
its
hands
why
is
it
that
of
two
individuals
exposed
to
the
same
situation
one
will
develop
a
complex
the
other
will
remain
immune
the
only
soil
we
know
of
the
real
foundation
stones
of
our
being
and
living
are
the
cells
we
are
made
of
tell
me
the
cellular
basis
of
a
complex
and
i
will
grant
that
you
have
arrived
at
some
real
knowledge
way
for
the
physiologist
there
has
grown
up
contemporaneously
with
the
teachings
of
freud
a
body
of
discoveries
and
knowledge
in
physiology
concerning
these
factors
which
is
like
a
long
sword
of
light
illuminating
a
spot
in
the
night
the
dark
places
in
human
nature
seem
to
have
become
the
sole
monopoly
of
the
freudians
and
their
psychology
but
only
seemingly
for
all
this
time
the
physiologist
has
been
working
beginning
with
a
candle
and
now
holding
in
his
hands
the
most
powerful
he
has
explored
two
regions
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
and
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
and
has
come
upon
data
which
in
due
course
will
render
a
good
many
of
the
freudian
dicta
obsolete
not
that
the
freudian
fundamentals
will
be
scrapped
completely
but
they
will
have
to
fit
into
the
great
synthesis
which
must
form
the
basis
of
any
control
of
the
future
of
human
nature
that
future
belongs
to
the
physiologist
already
his
achievements
provide
the
foundations
i
propose
in
the
following
chapters
to
sketch
the
history
and
outline
the
elements
of
this
new
knowledge
and
then
to
glimpse
some
of
the
larger
human
reactions
to
it
a
good
deal
of
this
new
knowledge
is
not
altogether
new
a
number
of
the
isolated
facts
have
been
known
and
talked
about
for
more
than
two
generations
but
the
newer
additions
and
the
light
they
have
thrown
upon
old
problems
present
the
opportunity
for
a
synthesis
which
must
sooner
or
later
be
made
the
chemistry
of
the
soul
besides
it
is
time
that
the
secrets
of
the
laboratories
stepped
out
into
the

place
unashamed
imaginative
man
has
played
for
ages
immemorial
with
wondrous
fairy
tales
and
fancies
of
what
he
would
achieve
the
sciences
of
physics
and
chemistry
have
made
everyday
commonplace
realities
out
of
his
radiant
dreams
one
need
not
repeat
the
clichés
of
our
editors
but
the
analogy
is
there
nevertheless
no
control
over
heat
and
light
and
electricity
today
our
slaves
was
possible
until
physics
and
chemistry
took
them
in
hand
no
control
of
the
human
soul
is
possible
until
it
too
will
be
taken
in
hand
by
them
we
may
now
look
forward
to
a
real
future
for
mankind
because
we
have
before
us
the
beginnings
of
a
chemistry
of
human
nature
the
internal
secretions
with
their
influence
upon
brain
and
nervous
system
as
well
as
every
other
part
of

real

a
huge
complex
of

as

obscure
as
human

itself
supports
that

the

magnificent

it
a
long
long
way
to
that
goal
the

formula
is
as

far
beyond

we
have
started
upon
the

we

get
there
then

the

the

we
are

realize
that
the

directions
the

in
science
has
yielded
miracles
for
some
thousands
of
years
an
isolated
individual
here
and
there
or
an
isolated
institution
have
devoted
themselves
to
the
task
struggling
not
only
with
their
own
weaknesses
but
with
religious
and
political
dogmas
which
spoiled
and
vitiated
even
the
beginnings
of
their
efforts
when
in
the
seventeenth
century
men
associated
themselves
in
research
for
free
communication
and
discussion
of
their
findings
a
great
invention
came
alive
close
on
its
heels
was
born
the

amazing
triumphs
were
born
of
that
marriage
which
swept
away
before
it
ignorance
and
superstition
and
prejudice
its
children
and
grandchildren
have
flourished
and
grown
strong
and
mighty
they
have
transmuted
the
material
conditions
of

certainly
all
the
laurels
belong
to
the
method
of
absolute
measured
observations
yet
all
this
time
the
old
method
of
inductive
observation
has
not
gone
dead
most
magnificent
triumph
of
nineteenth
century
science
the
evolution
theory
of
charles
darwin
remains
the
most
conspicuous
instance
of
clarification
of
thought
in
human
history
that
work
was
the
outcome
of
an
attempt
to
relate
and
interpret
a
collection
of
observations
on
species
and
their
variations
that
had
long
lain
to
hand
a
mixture
without
a
solvent
darwin
saw
certain
generalizations
as
solvents
and
behold
a
clear
solution
out
of
the
mud
but
it
was
by
piling
evidence
upon
evidence
isolated
facts
not
directly
associated
that
the
towering
structure
was
erected
there
is
no
prettier
sample
extant
of
the
powers
of
the
inductive
method
not
that
there
are
no
triumphs
of
the
quantitative
method
in
store
for
the
biologist
already
the
materials
of
the
mendelians
have
become
basic
parts
of
his
structure
and
today
in
pursuit
of
the
solutions
of
hundreds
of
the
problems
of
living
matter
chemists
and
physiologists
are
employing
the
most
precise
standards
units
and
measures
of
the
physical
sciences
blood
chemistry
of
our
time
is
a
marvel
undreamed
of
a
generation
ago
also
these
achievements
are
a
perfect
example
of
the
accomplished
fact
contradicting
a
priori
prediction
and
criticism
for
it
was
one
of
the
accepted
dogmas
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
phenomena
of
the
living
could
never
be
subjected
to
accurate
quantitative
analysis
however
desirable
the
purely
quantitative
experimental
methods
may
be
they
naturally
need
always
to
be
preceded
by
the
qualitative
studies
of
direct
observations
inevitably
there
will
be
numberless
errors
apparent
and
real
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
and
ideas
that
will
have
to
be
discarded
just
the
same
there
is
no
other
method
of
progress
every
bit
of
evidence
points
towards
the
internal
secretions
as
the
holders
of
the
secrets
of
our
inmost
being
they
are
the
well
springs
of
life
the
dynamos
of
the
organism
in
trailing
their
scent
we
appear
to
be
upon
the
track
not
only
of
the
chemistry
of
our
bodies
but
of
the
chemistry
of
our
very
souls
an
increasing
host
of
factors
and
studies
marshal
themselves
solidly
for
that
declaration
endeavor
to
conceive
the
consequences
and
possibilities
for
the
future
a
synthesis
of
the
known
in
the
field
provides
even
now
a
means
of
understanding
and
control
of
the
perplexities
of
human
nature
and
life
that
are
like
a
vista
seen
from
a
mountain
top
after
the
lifting
of
a
fog
the
most
precious
bit
of
knowledge
we
possess
today
about
man
is
that
he
is
the
creature
of
his
glands
of
internal
secretion
that
is
man
as
a
distinctive
organism
is
the
product
the
of
a
number
of
cell
factories
which
control
the
parts
of
his
much
as
the
different
divisions
of
an
automobile
concern
produce
the
different
parts
of
a
car
these
chemical
factories
consist
of
cells
manufacture
special
substances
which
act
upon
the
other
cells
of
the
body
and
so
start
and
determine
the
countless
processes
we
call
life
life
body
and
soul
emerge
from
the
activities
of
the
magic
ooze
of
their
silent
chemistry
precisely
as
a
tree
of
tin
crystals
arises
from
the
chemical
reactions
started
in
a
solution
of
tin
salts
by
an
electric
current
man
is
regulated
by
his
glands
of
internal
secretion
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
after
he
had
struggled
for
we
know
at
least
fifty
thousand
years
to
define
and
know
himself
that
summary
may
be
accepted
as
the
truth
about
himself
it
is
a
induction
but
a
valid
induction
supported
by
a
multitude
of
detailed
facts
amazingly
enough
the
incontestable
evidence
that
first
pointed
to
and
then
proved
up
to
the
hilt
this
answer
to
the
question
what
is
man
has
been
gathered
in
less
than
the
last
fifty
years
darwin
and
huxley
and
spencer
who
first
opened
men
eyes
to
their
origins
were
ignorant
of
the
very
existence
of
some
of
them
and
had
not
the
faintest
notion
or
suspicion
of
the
real
importance
or
function
of
any
of
them
the
prejudices
of
philosophers
now
there
are
certain
prejudices
and
problems
which
appear
to
be
rudely
brushed
away
by
the
dogmatic
arrogance
of
the
principle
stated
what
you
say
is
man
but
an
affair
of
his
peculiar
gland
chemistry
but
what
of
mind
soul
consciousness
still
another
of
these
pathetically
and
superficial
theories
of
man
as
a
machine
pure
and
simple
which
would
make
him
the
most
complicated
of
mechanisms
a
marvel
of
intricate
parts
but
would
deprive
him
of
his
essence
as
unique
in
the
universe
man
thinking
man
at
any
rate
dreads
to
lose
the
cherished
impregnable
conviction
that
he
is
something
apart
inherently
and
therefore
infinitely
different
from
every
other
phenomenon
in
the
range
of
his
cosmos
a
thorough
dissection
of
the
relation
and
attitude
toward
psychic
material
of
the
consistent
physiologist
who
refuses
to
deal
in
contradictory
terms

must

at

the

sides
may
be
reminded
of
certain
facts
we
live
in
the
most
iconoclastic
of

there
are

on

it
may
be
pointed
out
to
our
mechanists
who
believe
in
mechanism
to
the
bitter
end
that
even
if
man
can
be
described
entirely
as
a
mere
transformer
of

there
is
no
reason
why
he
can
not
also
be

of

plus
someone
who
makes

of
the

of

transformed

chapter
i
how
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
were
discovered
just
what
are
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
and
how
have
we
become
possessed
of
whatever
information
about
them
we
have
a
brief
review
of
how
the
idea
of
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
came
into
the
human
mind
and
of
the
contributions
that
have
converged
into
a
single
body
of
knowledge
is
worth
while
a
gland
is
a
collection
of
cells
those
viscous
globules
which
are
the
units
of
all
tissues
and
organs
it
manufactures
substances
intended
for
a
particular
effect
upon
the
body
economy
the
effect
may
be
either
local
or
upon
the
body
as
a
whole
originally
a
gland
meant
something
in
the
body
which
was
seen
to
make
something
else
generally
a
juice
or
a
liquid
mixture
of
some
sort
a
classical
example
is
the
salivary
glands
elaborating
saliva
the
microscope
has
shown
us
that
every
gland
is
a
chemical
factory
in
which
the
cells
are
the
workers
the
product
of
the
gland
work
is
its
secretion
thus
the
sweat
glands
of
the
skin
secrete
the
perspiration
as
their
secretion
the
lachrymal
glands
of
the
eyes
the
tears
as
theirs
the
collectivism
of
management
and
control
is
the
only
essential
difference
between
them
and
the
modern
soap
factory
or
plant
man
as
a
carnivor
and
as
a
consequent
anatomist
has
been
acquainted
with
these
more
superficially
placed
glands
for
some
thousands
of
years
during
all
this
time
and
during
the
epoch
of
the
achievements
of
gross
anatomy
it
was
believed
that
the
secretions
of
all
glands
were
poured
out
upon
some
surface
of
the
body
either
an
exterior
surface
like
the
skin
or
some
interior
surface
the
various
mucous
membranes
this
was
supported
by
the
discovery
of
passage
ways
leading
from
the
gland
to
the
particular
surface
where
its
secretion
was
to
act
these
corridors
the
secretory
or
excretory
ducts
are
present
for
example
in
the
liver
conducting
the
bile
to
the
small
intestine
devices
of
transportation
fit
happily
into
a
comparison
of
a
gland
to
a
chemical
factory
corresponding
thus
closely
to
the
tramways
and
railroads
of
our
industrial
centers
little
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
observed
that
certain
organs
like
the
thyroid
body
in
the
neck
and
the
adrenal
capsules
in
the
abdomen
hitherto
neglected
because
their
function
was
hopelessly
obscure
had
a
glandular
structure
as
in
so
much
scientific
advance
the
discovery
or
improvement
of
a
new
instrument
or
method
a
fresh
tool
of
research
was
responsible
the
perfection
of
the
microscope
was
the
reason
this
time
if
one
wishes
to
trace
the
idea
of
internal
secretion
by
cells
to
an
individual
it
is
convenient
if
not
pedantic
to
give
the
credit
to
theophile
de
bordeu
a
famous
physician
of
paris
in
the
eighteenth
century
bordeu
came
to
paris
as
a
brilliant
provincial
in
his
early
twenties
and
by
the
charm
of
his
manner
and
daring
therapy
fought
his
way
to
the
most
exclusive
aristocratic
practice
of
the
court
naturally
a
courtier
taking
to
the
intrigues
of
the
royal
court
like
a
duck
to
water
making
enemies
on
every
hand
as
well
as
friends
and
with
a
fastidious
and
impatient
clientele
he
yet
found
time
to
dabble
in
the
wonders
of
the
newly
perfected
microscope
and
to
speculate
upon
the
meaning
of
the
novelties
revealed
by
it
in
the
tissues
coined
the
thought
of
a
gland
secretion
into
the
it
was
in
the
year
that
he
came
to
paris
from
the
pyrenees
a
young
medical
graduate
destined
to
become
the
most
fashionable
practitioner
of
his
time
at
the
age
of
he
was
holding
the
professorship
of
anatomy
at
his
alma
mater
montpelier
where
his
father
was
a
successful
physician
at
he
was
elected
corresponding
member
of
the
royal
academy
of
sciences
a
handsome
presence
and
a
tartarin
de
tarascon
disposition
assured
his
success
from
the
start
the
medical
world
was
then
composed
of
the
emulsion
of
charlatanry
and
science
molière
ridiculed
success
stimulated
envy
and
jealousy
one
of
the
richest
of
the
older
medical
men
set
himself
the
job
of
procuring
his
scalp
on
a
charge
of
stealing
jewels
from
a
dead
patient
a
favorite
accusation
against
the
doctors
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
had
bordeu
license
taken
away
from
him
the
good
graces
of
certain
women
to
whom
bordeu
had
always
appealed
and
who
indeed
supplied
the
funds
to
get
him
started
in
paris
rammed
through
two
acts
of
parliament
to
reinstate
him
nothing
daunted
he
returned
to
his
quest
for
a
court
clientele
and
was
rewarded
finally
by
having
the
moribund
louis
xv
as
a
patient
this
was
the
man
with
whom
the
modern
history
of
the
internal
secretions
begins
not
content
with
adventures
among
the
courtiers
and
desperadoes
of
the
most
corrupt
court
in
the
most
corrupt
city
of
the
world
he
went
in
for
research
the
high
power
microscope
that
came
into
vogue
when
he
was
studying
revealed
vague
wonders
which
he
described
in
a
monograph
researches
into
the
mucous
tissues
or
cellular
organs
but
what
makes
him
interesting
is
a
slender
volume
on
the
medical
analysis
of
the
blood
published
in
the
year
of
the
american
declaration
of
independence
the
sexual
side
of
men
and
women
aroused
bordeu
most
ardent
enthusiasms
starting
with
observations
on
the
characters
of
eunuchs
and
capons
as
well
as
spayed
female
animals
he
formulated
a
conception
of
sexual
secretions
absorbed
into
the
blood
settling
the
male
or
female
tint
of
the
organism
and
setting
the
seal
upon
the
destiny
of
the
individual
thus
he
must
be
donated
the
credit
of
anticipating
the
most
modern
doctrine
on
the
subject
the
generation
after
him
witnessed
the
triumph
of
the
cell
as
the
recognized
unit
of
structure
of
the
tissues
the
brick
of
the
organs
it
was
soon
found
that
the
cells
of
the
more
familiar
glands
like
the
sweat
or
tear
glands
resembled
the
cells
of
the
more
mysterious
structures
named
the
thyroid
in
the
neck
or
adrenal
in
the
abdomen
of
which
the
function
was
unknown
what
had
hitherto
prevented
classification
of
the
latter
as
glands
was
the
fact
that
they
possessed
no
visible
pathways
for
the
removal
of
their
secretion
so
now
they
were
set
apart
as
the
glands
the
glands
without
ducts
as
contrasted
with
the
glands
normally
equipped
with
ducts
since
too
they
were
observed
to
have
an
exceedingly
rich
supply
of
blood
the
blood
presented
itself
as
the
only
conceivable
mode
of
egress
for
the
secretions
packed
within
the
cells
so
they
were
also
called
the
blood
or
vascular
glands
the
names
which
became
most
popular
were
those
which
represented
a
contrast
of
the
glands
with
the
ducts
conveying
their
secretion
to
the
exterior
as
the
glands
of
external
secretion
and
the
glands
without
the
ducts
the
secretions
of
which
were
kept
within
the
body
absorbed
by
the
blood
and
lymph
to
be
used
by
the
other
cells
as
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
how
different
these
two
classes
of
glands
are
may
be
realized
by
imagining
the
existence
of
great
factories
manufacturing
food
products
which
would
diffuse
through
their
walls
into
the
atmosphere
to
be
absorbed
by
our
bodies
there
are
certain
terms
for
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
which
are
used
interchangeably
they
are
spoken
of
often
as
the
glands
and
as
the
producing
glands
endocrine
is
most
convenient
for
it
stands
for
both
the
gland
and
its
secretion
hormone
is
employed
a
good
deal
in
the
literature
of
the
subject
but
it
applies
specifically
to
the
internal
secretion
and
not
to
the
gland
the
experimental
pioneer
all
this
clarification
of
the
concept
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
occurred
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
however
no
inkling
of
their
real
importance
to
the
body
of
which
quantitatively
they
form
so
insignificant
a
part
was
apparently
revealed
to
anyone
not
even
the
most
daring
speculation
or
brilliant
guess
work
in
physiology
engaged
them
as
material
thus
henle
the
great
anatomist
calmly
affirmed
that
these
glands
have
no
influence
on
animal
life
they
may
be
extirpated
or
they
degenerate
without
sensation
or
motion
suffering
in
the
least
johann
müller
the
most
celebrated
physiologist
of
his
day
and
contemporary
of
henle
wrote
in
and
coolly
stated
the
ductless
glands
are
alike
in
one
particular
they
either
produce
a
different
change
in
the
blood
which
circulates
through
them
or
the
lymph
which
they
elaborate
plays
a
special
rôle
in
the
formation
of
blood
or
of
chyle
in
other
words
they
were
dismissed
as
curious
nonentities
of
no
real
significance
to
the
running
of
the
body
laennec
the
french
founder
of
the
art
of
diagnosis
in
medicine
once
said
that
nothing
about
a
science
is
more
interesting
than
the
progress
of
that
science
itself
he
might
have
added
that
nothing
either
was
more
interesting
than
the
contradictions
in
that
progress
for
while
these
grand
moguls
of
their
sciences
were
enunciating
their
dogmas
pioneers
here
and
there
were
already
setting
the
mines
that
were
to
explode
them
the
experimental
method
to
the
value
of
which
biologists
were
just
beginning
to
awaken
was
destined
to
be
the
vehicle
of
revenges
an
application
of
it
to
the
mysteries
of
sex
was
the
immediate
occasion
sex
and
sex
differences
have
always
more
or
less
obsessed
the
imagination
of
mankind
the
volumes
of
theories
about
them
would
constitute
a
respectable
museum
certain
gross
facts
however
were
known
the
effects
of
loss
of
the
sex
glands
upon
the
configuration
of
the
body
and
the
predominating
constitution
in
animals
and
eunuchs
have
always
attracted
attention
the
proverbs
and
stories
of
all
nations
are
full
of
references
to
them
but
up
to
the
nineteenth
century
no
controlled
experimental
work
was
ever
carried
out
regarding
them
it
was
in
that
berthold
of
göttingen
a
quiet
sedate
lecturer
carried
out
the
pioneer
experiment
of
removing
the
testes
of
four
roosters
and
transplanting
them
under
the
skin
it
was
berthold
idea
to
test
whether
a
gland
with
a
definite
external
secretion
and
a
duct
through
which
that
secretion
was
expelled
but
which
yet
had
powers
over
the
body
as
a
whole
that
were
to
be
attributed
only
to
an
internal
secretion
could
not
be
shown
by
a
experiment
to
possess
such
an
internal
secretion
he
succeeded
perfectly
for
he
found
that
though
in
thus
separating
the
gland
from
its
duct
and
so
cutting
off
its
external
secretion
the
action
of
the
cells
manufacturing
that
secretion
was
destroyed
the
general
effects
upon
the
body
were
not
those
of
castration
the
animals
retained
their
male
characteristics
as
regards
voice
reproductive
instinct
fighting
spirit
and
growth
of
comb
and
wattles
whereas
if
the
glands
were
entirely
removed
these
male
traits
peculiar
to
the
rooster
were
completely
lost
the
inference
was
the
existence
of
an
internal
secretion
to
berthold
belongs
the
honor
of
being
the
first
experimental
demonstrator
who
proved
the
reality
of
a
gland
with
a
true
internal
secretion
and
the
power
it
exercised
through
the
blood
upon
the
entire
organism
besides
he
showed
that
a
typical
gland
of
external
secretion
could
also
have
an
internal
secretion
a
possibility
never
before
considered
that
two
kinds
of
cells
could
live
within
the
same
gland
one
set
usually
recognized
as
producing
the
external
secretion
the
other
evolving
the
internal
secretion
was
an
astounding
original
conception
enter
claude
bernard
science
is
supposed
to
be
immune
to
the
personal
prejudices
and
emotional
habits
of
the
vulgar
it
is
the
tradition
that
a
new
contribution
to
knowledge
emerging
from
no
matter
how
obscure
the
source
should
be
hailed
as
a
gift
from
the
gods
but
the
sad
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
a
new
finding
in
science
requires
as
much
backing
as
a
new
project
in
high
finance
or
social
climbing
berthold
like
mendel
the
founder
of
genetics
was
a
great
pioneer
but
there
was
no
personage
no
person
of
consequence
with
no
patronage
by
anyone
of
consequence
no
wife
or
kin
to
push
him
and
no
audience
to
stimulate
him
his
poor
four
little
pages
of
a
report
published
ten
years
before
darwin
origin
of
species
attracted
not
the
slightest
notice
buried
in
the
print
of
a
journal
with
a
subscription
list
of
possibly
two
or
three
hundred
of
whom
perhaps
two
dozen
may
have
been
interested
enough
to
read
it
but
without
any
recorded
reaction
on
the
part
of
any
of
them
it
was
a
flash
in
the
pan
though
it
was
good
original
conclusive
stuff
it
was
cut
dead
absolutely
by
the
scientific
world
as
a
result
forty
years
elapsed
before
the
implications
of
his
studies
were
rediscovered
by
the
columbus
of
the
modern
approach
to
the
internal
secretions
the
american
frenchman
it
took
a
first
class
man
of
genius
in
his
field
in
paris
with
a
respected
position
in
the
whirl
of
its
medical
planetary
system
and
a
university
appointment
to
boom
and
advertise
the
doctrine
of
the
internal
secretions
so
that
people
began
to
sit
up
and
listen
and
take
sides
on
the
wrong
grounds
this
frenchman
was
claude
bernard
at
a
series
of
lectures
on
experimental
physiology
delivered
at
the
college
of
france
in
he
coined
the
terms
internal
secretion
and
external
secretion
and
emphasized
the
opposition
between
them
on
the
basis
of
an
incorrect
example
the
function
of
the
liver
in
the
supply
of
sugar
to
the
blood
just
as
columbus
reached
america
carried
on
a
series
of
logical
syllogisms
built
upon
unreal
pictures
of
a
straight
path
to
the
east
claude
bernard
opened
up
the
continent
of
the
internal
secretions
to
the
experimental
enthusiasts
of
his
time
by
a
discovery
which
today
is
not
grouped
among
the
phenomena
of
internal
secretion
at
all
in
attempting
to
throw
light
upon
the
disease
diabetes
in
which
there
is
a
loss
of
the
normal
ability
of
the
cells
to
burn
up
sugar
he
examined
the
sugar
content
of
the
blood
in
different
regions
of
the
body
he
found
that
the
blood
of
the
veins
in
general
contained
less
sugar
than
the
blood
of
the
arteries
which
meant
that
sugar
was
taken
from
the
blood
in
passing
through
the
tissues
but
the
venous
blood
of
the
right
side
of
the
heart
contained
as
much
sugar
as
the
arterial
blood
evidently
somewhere

was
added
to
the
blood
in
the
veins
before
it
got
to
the
heart
the
blood
of
the
vein
which
goes
from
the
liver
to
the
right
side
of
the
heart
was
then
found
to
contain
a
higher
percentage
of
sugar
than
is
present
in
the
arteries
the
vein
which
transmits
the
blood
from
the
intestines
to
the
liver
had
the
usual
lower
percentage
of
sugar
corresponding
to
the
analysis
established
for
the
other
veins
the
liver
therefore
must
add
sugar
to
the
blood
on
its
way
to
the
heart
extraction
of
the
liver
then
revealed
the
presence
in
it
of
a
form
of
starch
an
animal
starch
which
bernard
called
glycogen
the
the
origin
of
the
sugar
added
to
the
blood
on
its
way
from
the
liver
to
the
heart
was
thus
settled
bernard
went
on
to
hail
glycogen
and
the
sugar
derivable
as
the
internal
secretions
of
the
liver
and
to
erect
and
then
drive
home
a
theory
of
internal
secretions
and
their
importance
in
the
body
economy
the
case
he
had
hit
upon
was
exquisitely
fortunate
as
the
liver
had
hitherto
been
regarded
purely
a
gland
of
external
secretion
the
bile
nowadays
glycogen
and
the
blood
sugar
are
not
considered
internal
secretions
because
they
are
classified
as
elementary
reserve
food
while
the
concept
of
the
internal
secretions
has
become
narrowed
down
to
substances
acting
as
starters
or
inhibitors
of
different
processes
moreover
the
process
of
liberation
of
sugar
from
glycogen
itself
in
the
liver
upon
demand
is
today
set
down
to
the
action
of
an
internal
secretion
adrenalin
claude
bernard
conception
like
a
characters
has
turned
upon
its
creator
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
evolved
into
something
he
never
intended
he
looked
upon
an
internal
secretion
as
simply
maintaining
the
normal
composition
of
the
blood
which
bathed
alike
and
treated
alike
the

the

is
believed
merely
the
transporting

addison
as
the
first
english
contribution
the
years
are
years
in
the
history
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
they
witnessed
not
only
the
publication
of
claude
bernard
lectures
on
experimental
physiology
but
also
the
appearance
of
a
monograph
by
thomas
addison
an
english
physician
entitled
on
the
constitutional
and
local
effects
of
disease
of
the
suprarenal
bodies
in
this
he
described
a
fatal
disease
during
which
the
individual
affected
became
languid
and
weak
and
developed
a
dingy
or
smoky
discoloration
of
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
a
browning
or
bronzing
of
the
skin
caused
generally
by
destructive
tuberculous
disease
of
the
suprarenal
or
adrenal
bodies
addison
promptly
put
down
these
constitutional
effects
of
loss
of
the
adrenal
bodies
to
loss
of
something
produced
by
them
of
constitutional
importance
he
was
particularly
struck
by
the
change
in
the
pigmentation
of
the
skin
so
much
so
that
his
own
designation
for
the
affection
was
bronzed
skin
since
then
however
the
condition
has
been
universally
styled
addison
disease
there
is
something
spectacularly
mysterious
and
picturesque
about
most
of
the
malign
insidious
effects
of
the
disease
which
appealed
at
once
to
a
number
of
investigators
the
most
adventurous
the
most
daring
the
most
imbued
with
enthusiasm
for
the
experimental
method
was
the
american
frenchman
who
is
acknowledged
the
father
of
modern
knowledge
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
though
to
claude
bernard
belong
the
honors
of
the
grandfather
the
great
as
the
outstanding
figure
in
the
history
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
deserves
some
notice
as
a
personality
in
the
words
of
the
for
novels
and
plays
he
was
a
card
he
was
born
in
at
on
the
island
of
mauritius
off
africa
then
french
property
his
father
was
a
brown
an
american
sea
captain
his
mother
a
mme
séquard
a
frenchwoman
early
in
childhood
the
father
sailed
away
on
one
of
his
voyages
and
never
came
back
the
mother
thereafter
supported
herself
and
her
son

was
clerking
in
a
colonial
store
by
day
and
composing
poetry
romances
and
plays
by
night
the
call
of
paris
was
in
his
blood
which
was
indeed
a
supersaturated
solution
of
wanderlust
soon
he
was
landed
there
to
make
his
fortune
in

only
too
speedily
to
be
disillusioned
exhibition
of

to
a
leading
literary
light
merely
evoked
curt
advice
to
learn
a
trade
or
go
into
business
he
would
have
none
of
either
and
studied
medicine
instead
earning
his
way
by
teaching
as
he
learned
in
the
laboratories
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
people
who
more
than
once
were
to
be
his
salvation
in
the
ups
and
downs
of
his
career
in
he
was
one
of
the
secretaries
of
the
society
of
biology
newly
founded
by
claude
bernard
some
trouble
perhaps
some
effect
upon
his
health
of
cholera
which
then
swept
paris
caused
him
to
return
to
his
native
mauritius
to
encounter
an
epidemic
of
cholera
there
he
slaved
manfully
for
which
a
gold
medal
was
afterward
struck
for
him
that
over
with
he
embarked
in
for
new
york
without
a
word
of
american
learning
english
on
board
this
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
voyages
as
he
often
boasted
he
crossed
the
ocean
sixty
times
not
a
bad
record
for
the
days
when
the
was
still
in
the
womb
of
time
he
made
a
hopeless
failure
out
of
practice
in
new
york
became
so
poor
as
to
practice
obstetrics
at
five
dollars
a
case
and
married
a
niece
of
daniel
webster
then
he
went
back
to
paris
back
to
america
next
as
professor
of
physiology
at
the
university
of
richmond
virginia
a
job
occupied
for
a
few
months
only
because
of
his
opinions
on
slavery
ostensibly
anyhow
to
paris
then
the
rolling
stone
meandered
again
so
that
soon
after
he
was
offered
and
accepted
the
charge
of
a
great
newly
opened
hospital
for
epileptics
in
london
that
proved
merely
an
interlude
and
in
we
find
him
back
in
his
fatherland
if
we
may
hold
france
his
motherland
as
professor
of
neuropathology
at
harvard
in
new
york
fame
preceded
him
now
with
a
thousand
trumpets
so
that
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
he
was
kept
busy
seeing
patients
until
night
when
he
had
to
desist
because
of
exhaustion
but
still
he
did
not
prosper
an
unfortunate
second
marriage
almost
broke
his
heart
and
an
attempt
to
found
in
new
york
a
new
medical
periodical
the
of
scientific
and
practical
medicine
and
got
him
into
hot
water
not
until
the
death
of
claude
bernard
in
left
vacant
the
chair
of
physiology
in
the
college
of
france
did
he
find
peace
and
rest
he
hastened
to
paris
was
appointed
and
lived
in
spite
of
the
most
erratic
of
existences
to
the
ripe
old
age
of
working
up
to
the
last
minute
addison
monograph
stimulated
in
the
year
after
its
printing
to
reproduce
the
fatal
disease
experimentally
by
excising
the
suprarenal
capsules
in
animals
addison
was
very
modest
in
his
monograph
he
stated
that
the
first
case
of
the
malady
had
been
reported
by
his
great
predecessor
at
guy
hospital
london
richard
bright
the
describer
of
bright
disease
then
he
talks
about
the
curious
facts
he
had
stumbled
upon
and
refers
to
an
impression
that
these
suprarenal
bodies
in
common
with
the
spleen
and
other
organs
in
some
way
or
other
minister
to
the
elaboration
of
the
blood
in
the
preface
to
his
work
he
had
spoken
more
confidently
of
the
fact
that
nature
as
an
experimenter
and
a
vivisector
can
beat
the
physiologist
to
a
frazzle
indeed
he
begins
like
this
if
pathology
be
to
disease
what
physiology
is
to
health
it
appears
reasonable
to
conclude
that
in
any
given
structure
or
organ
the
laws
of
the
former
will
be
as
fixed
and
significant
as
those
of
the
latter
and
that
the
peculiar
characters
of
any
structure
or
organ
may
be
as
certainly
recognized
in
the
phenomena
of
disease
as
in
the
phenomena
of
health
although
pathology
therefore
as
a
branch
of
medical
science
is
necessarily
founded
on
physiology
questions
may
nevertheless
arise
regarding
the
true
character
of
a
structure
or
organ
to
which
occasionally
the
pathologist
may
be
able
to
return
a
more
satisfactory
and
decisive
reply
than
the
physiologist
these
two
branches
of
medical
knowledge
being
thus
found
mutually
to
advance
and
illustrate
each
other
indeed
as
regards
the
functions
of
individual
organs
the
mutual
aids
of
these
two
branches
of
knowledge
are
probably
much
more
nearly
balanced
than
many
may
be
disposed
to
admit
for
in
estimating
them
we
are
very
apt
to
forget
how
large
an
amount
of
our
present
physiological
knowledge
respecting
the
functions
of
these
organs
has
been
the
immediate
result
of
casual
observations
made
on
the
effects
of
disease
william
james
expressed
the
same
thought
some
decades
later
when
he
emphasized
that
the
abnormal
was
but
the
normal
exaggerated
and
magnified
played
upon
by
the
limelight
and
therefore
the
best
teacher
and
indicator
of
the
exact
definition
and
limitations
of
the
normal
addison
speaking
before
the
south
london
medical
society
in
declared
that
in
all
of
three
afflicted
individuals
there
was
found
a
diseased
condition
of
the
suprarenal
capsules
and
that
in
spite
of
the
consciousness
of
the
bias
and
prejudice
inseparable
from
the
hope
or
vanity
of
an
original
discovery
he
could
not
help
entertaining
a
very
strong
impression
that
these
hitherto
mysterious
organs
the
suprarenal
capsules
may
be
either
directly
or
indirectly
concerned
in
sanguification
the
making
of
the
blood
and
that
a
diseased
condition
of
them
functional
or
structural
may
interfere
with
the
proper
elaboration
of
the
body
generally
or
of
the
red
particles
more
especially
a
modern
acquainted
with
after
developments
would
say
that
addison
was
very
hot
upon
the
trail
indeed
but
withal
though
he
must
have
been
well
aware
of
john
hunter
advice
to
jenner
on
vaccination
do
think
make
some
observations
his
training
in
the
indirect
reasoning
and
deductions
of
the
clinician
prevented
him
from
going
right
on
to
a
direct
experimental
test
of
his
theories
this
proceeded
to
do
removing
the
adrenal
glands
in
several
species
of
animals
he
found
meant
a
terrible
weakness
in
to
hours
and
death
shortly
after
if
only
one
were
removed
there
was
no
change
apparent
in
the
normal
animal
but
death
occurred
rapidly
upon
removal
of
the
other
even
after
a
long
interval
furthermore
transfusion
of
blood
from
a
normal
into
one
deprived
of
its
suprarenals
prevented
death
for
a
long
time
indicating
that
the
suprarenals
normally
secreted
something
into
the
blood
necessary
to
life
the
years
beheld
two
other
important
glands
of
internal
secretion
the
thyroid
the
gland
in
the
neck
astride
the
windpipe
and
the
thymus
in
the
chest
above
the
heart
make
their
debut
the
thymus
was
introduced
by
the
great
classic
monograph
of
friedleben
on
the
physiology
of
the
thymus
in
which
he
mentioned
the
usual
forgotten
pioneers
felix
plater
a
swiss
physician
who
in
had
found
an
enlarged
thymus
in
an
infant
dying
suddenly
and
restelli
an
italian
who
interested
himself
in
the
effects
of
removal
of
the
thymus
more
than
ten
years
before
friedleben
believed
that
in
the
young
without
a
thymus
there
occurred
a
softening
of
the
bones
and
general
physical
and
mental
deterioration
he
started
the
ball
rolling
for
a
number
of
researches
moritz
schiff
of
showed
that
excision
of
the
thyroid
gland
in
dogs
is
invariably
fatal
a
number
of
physicians
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
had
reported
certain
remarkable
symptoms
associated
with
enlargement
of
the
thyroid
gland
as
goitre
in
the
collected
posthumous
writings
of
caleb
perry
an
eminent
physician
of
bath
england
recorded
eight
cases
in
which
together
with
enlargement
of
the
gland
there
developed
enlargement
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
a
distinct
protrusion
of
the
eyes
from
their
sockets
and
an
appearance
of
agitation
and
distress
schiff
paper
was
the
first
to
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
but
for
some
reason
probably
the
same
as
in
berthold
forlorn
experiments
with
the
sex
glands
the
work
of
a
person
of
no
importance
was
ignored
or
perhaps
the
more
charitable
view
is
that
it
was
forgotten
yet
the
tide
of
observation
kept
sweeping
in
relevant
data
in
curling
an
english
pathologist
studying
the
cretinous
idiots
of
salzburg
written
about
centuries
before
by
paracelsus
discovered
that
with
their
defective
brain
and
mentality
there
was
associated
an
absence
of
the
thyroid
body
and
accompanying
symmetrical
swellings
of
fat
tissue
at
the
sides
of
the
neck
then
sir
william
gull
in
painted
the
singular
details
of
a
cretinous
condition
developing
in
adult
women
a
condition
to
which
another
englishman
william
ord
of
london
five
years
later
donated
the
title
of
myxedema
because
of
a
characteristic
thickening
and
infiltration
of
the
skin
that
is
one
of
its
features
surgery
then
enters
upon
the
scene
the
great
swiss
surgeon
theodore
kocher
performed
the
first
excision
of
the
thyroid
gland
in
human
beings
for
goitre
in
the
same
year
in
reverdin
another
surgeon
of
geneva
noticed
that
in
man
complete
removal
of
the
thyroid
was
followed
by
symptoms
identical
with
those
collected
under
the
name
of
myxedema
and
used
the
phrase
operative
myxedema
to
emphasize
his
conviction
of
the
connection
between
them
then
schiff
in
neglected
years
came
back
with
an
array
of
demonstrations
proving
that
the
various
symptoms
tremors
spasms
and
convulsions
following
removal
of
the
thyroid
could
be
prevented
by
a
previous
graft
of
a
piece
of
the
gland
under
the
skin
or
by
the
injection
of
thyroid
juice
into
a
vein
or
under
the
skin
or
by
the
ingestion
of
thyroid
juice
or
the
raw
thyroid
by
mouth
a
crystallization
of
ideas
about
the
true
function
of
the
thyroid
was
now
inevitable
in
sir
victor
horsley
produced
an
experimental
myxedema
by
removal
of
the
thyroid
in
monkeys
resembling
closely
in
its
the
disease
as
it
occurs
in
human
beings
möbius
a
german
neurologist
came
out
boldly
for
the
conception
that
a
number
of
ailments
could
be
due
to
qualitative
and
quantitative
changes
in
the
secretion
of
the
thyroid
and
that
just
as
myxedema
and
cretinism
were
due
to
an
insufficiency
of
the
secretion
parry
disease
was
to
be
ascribed
to
an
excessive
outpouring
of
it
the
next
steps
were
easy
in
sir
felix
semon
as
an
outcome
of
a
collective
investigation
established
for
all
time
that
cretinism
myxedema
and
myxedema
were
one
and
the
same
it
was
bound
to
occur
to
someone
that
if
human
myxedema
and
animal
experimental
myxedema
were
one
and
the
same
schiff
procedure
of
prevention
and
cure
by
feeding
thyroid
gland
by
mouth
in
the
latter
could
be
applied
to
the
former

to

all
these
characters
tall
or
short
fat
or
lean
are
related
to
the
activity
of
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
in
the
head
the
pituitary
which
became
a
centre
of
interest
in
the
late
eighties
because
of
its
situation
the
opinion
of
the
ancients
was
that
it
was
the
source
of
the
mucus
of
the
nose
an
opinion
reinforced
by
the
greatest
anatomist
of
the
dark
ages
galen
and
held
up
to
the
seventeenth
century
in
other
words
it
was
considered
simply
a
gland
of
external
secretion
experimental
removal
of
the
pituitary
was
essayed
by
horsley
in
the
same
man
who
two
years
before
had
reproduced
myxedema
successfully
in
monkeys
others
succeeded
his
attempt
but
the
conclusions
drawn
were
uncertain
or
contradictory
resulting
from
the
difficulties
of
the
operative
technique
of
getting
at
a
gland
placed
at
the
base
of
the
brain
not
until
was
the
problem
solved
by
paulesco
of
bucharest
who
devised
a
way
of
reaching
it
by
trepanning
the
skull
he
was
thus
able
to
prove
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
pituitary
gland
was
essential
to
life
and
that
without
it
no
animal
could
continue
to
live
for
any
length
of
time
soon
after
harvey
gushing
and
his
associates
at
johns
hopkins
hospital
discovered
that
removal
of
part
of
the
gland
was
followed
by
a
pronounced
obesity
and
sluggishness
a
basis
for
the
understanding
of
obesity
and
growth
was
then
established
in
the
eighties
there
came
to
the
clinic
of
pierre
marie
in
paris
a
pupil
of
the
great
charcot
various
women
complaining
of
headache
they
also
told
him
about
an
enlargement
of
their
hands
and
feet
and
an
alarming
change
in
the
bones
of
the
face
he
differentiated
the
affection
from
its
imitators
and
created
its
present
designation
of
acromegaly
enlargement
of
the
extremities
also
he
correlated
their
relationship
to
the
giants
who
have
been
mentioned
acromegalics
have
been
also
likened
to
the
neanderthal
man
who
had
probably
as
the
gorillas
may
have
an
excess
of
the
pituitary
in
their
systems
for
four
years
he
studied
the
morbid
phenomena
in
the
tissues
of
these
sufferers
at
last
consigned
to
their
end
first
one
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
exhibited
a
striking
hypertrophy
of
the
pituitary
body
and
a
consequent
widening
of
the
portion
of
the
base
of
the
skull
which
cradles
the
gland
he
proceeded
to
say
so
in
the
graduating
thesis
of
his
pupil
souza
leite
the
inference
was
inevitable
that
the
entire
process
was
to
be
put
down
to
an
overactivity
of
the
pituitary
ever
since
too
the
growth
of
the
skeleton
has
been
accepted
as
controlled
by
that
gland
about
this
time
another
set
of
old
observations
came
to
life
again
related
to
those
of
docent
berthold
on
the
of
the
testes
of
a
cock
with
complete
retention
of
its
sexual
characters
which
he
said
must
be
due
to
the
productive
action
of
the
testes
to
its
effect
upon
the
blood
and
thence
to
the
corresponding
effect
of
such
blood
upon
the
entire
organism
of
course
stock
raisers
and
poultry
fanciers
have
noted
the
interesting
outcome
of
castration
for
about
as
long
as
their
professions
have
existed
and
for
ages
the
diminution
of
sexual
activity
as
a
predecessor
to
the
decadence
of
senility
has
been
harped
upon
rejuvenation
especially
in
connection
with
sexual
activity
as
well
as
with
tissue
and
spiritual
elasticity
has
been
one
of
the
haunting
phantoms
of
the
imagination
for
as
long
as
we
have
records
of
articulate
humanity
together
with
el
dorado
the
elixir
of
youth
has
shared
the
honors
with
the
stone
the
idea
of
employing
the
chemical
materials
of
the
sex
glands
the
testes
or
the
ovaries
to
bring
back
youth
to
restore
juvenility
had
not
as
far
as
we
know
occurred
to
anyone
who
at
any
rate
put
himself
on
record
by
word
or
deed
until
the
hero
of
the
new
departure
was
the
hero
of
so
many
daring
adventures
among
speculative
experiments
at
this
time
the
wanderer
was
an
aged
sage
years
old
fit
as
custom
goes
only
for
retirement
and
resignation
to
the
fate
of
all
flesh
the
old
passion
of
experimenting
upon
himself
as
well
as
upon
the
dogs
cats
and
monkeys
by
which
he
was
always
surrounded
was
as
alive
and
kicking
as
ever
i
suppose
he
had
been
thinking
for
years
concerning
some
method
for
the
resumption
of
youth
for
we
find
him
exclaiming
when
the
opportunity
loomed
of
a
great
laboratory
on
agassiz
island
long
island
on
one
of
his
recurrent
flights
to
new
york
would
that
i
were
thirty
and
other
passages
in
his
personal
communications
refer
again
and
again
to
his
consciousness
of
growing
old
the
miracles
that
were
being
performed
by
injecting
thyroid
and
feeding
thyroid
in
animals
probably
acted
as
the
spark
to
an
inflammable
mass
of
ideas
long
smouldering
in
the
subcellars
of
his
mind
the
effects
were
reported
to
the
society
of
biology
in
paris
one
memorable
evening
june
in
two
notes
on
the
results
of
the
hypodermic
injection
in
man
of
the
testis
juice
of
monkeys
and
dogs
and
certain
generalizations
deduced
therefrom
such
juices
he
stated
had
a
definite
or
as
he
put
it
dynamogenic
action
upon
the
subject
himself
stimulating
amazingly
his
general
health
muscular
power
and
mental
activity
these
experiments
their
nature
the
manner
in
which
they
were
conducted
the
character
and
age
of
the
experimenter
and
the
results
claimed
were
exquisitely
good
stuff
for
ridicule
cartoonists
and
reporters
leaped
upon
the
theme
with
the
avidity
of
the
interviewer
paris
where
to
be
ridiculed
is
to
be
killed
in
public
with
the
most
ignominious
of
deaths
reacted
as
only
the
french
temperament
can
react
the
wits
of
the
salons
crackled
the
bourgeoisie
chortled
the
proletariat
roared
the
elixir
of
life
had
been
discovered
and
it
was
excellent
sport
but
remained
unshaken
he
had
all
the
roués
of
paris
running
to
him
and
consequent
charges
of
quackery
and
charlatanism
how
much
of
these
unsavory
epithets
really
applied
to
him
will
not
be
determined
until
we
have
a
better
acquaintance
with
his
more
intimate
life
a
biography
and
collection
of
his
letters
is
needed
but
it
is
certain
that
the
general
principles
he
arrived
at
aided
as
much
by
the
wings
of
intuition
as
by
the
clues
of
incomplete
and
incompletely
controlled
experiments
survive
as
the
foundations
of
whatever
we
know
about
the
internal
secretions
and
all
our
present
viewpoints
he
summed
these
up
in
as
follows
all
the
tissues
in
our
view
are
modifiers
of
the
blood
by
means
of
an
internal
secretion
taken
from
them
by
the
venous
blood
from
this
we
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
if
subcutaneous
injections
of
the
liquids
drawn
from
these
parts
are
ineffectual
then
we
should
inject
some
of
the
venous
blood
supplying
these
parts
we
admit
that
each
tissue
and
more
generally
each
cell
of
the
organism
secretes
on
its
own
account
certain
products
or
special
ferments
which
through
this
medium
the
blood
influence
all
other
cells
of
the
body
a
definite
solidarity
being
thus
established
among
all
the
cells
through
a
mechanism
other
than
the
nervous
system
all
the
tissues
glands
and
other
organs
have
thus
a
special
internal
secretion
and
so
give
to
the
blood
something
more
than
the
waste
products
of
metabolism
the
internal
secretions
whether
by
direct
favorable
influence
or
whether
through
the
obstacles
they
oppose
to
deleterious
processes
seem
to
be
of
great
utility
in
maintaining
the
organism
in
its
normal
state
the
only
part
of
this
statement
not
conceded
today
is
that
relating
to
the
formation
of
internal
secretions
by
tissues
other
than
those
of
which
the
cells
are
definitely
glandular
that
is
secretory
as
can
be
determined
under
the
microscope
added
to
the
concept
of
internal
secretions
fathered
by
claude
bernard
the
idea
of
a
correlation
a
mutual
influencing
of
them
and
of
the
different
organs
of
the
body
through
them
the
nervous
system
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
the
sole
means
of
communication
between
cells
by
its
telegraphic
arrangements
of
nerve
filaments
reaching
out
everywhere
interweaving
with
each
other
and
the
cells
the
conception
inferred
the
existence
of
a
postal
system
between
cells
the
blood
supplying
the
highway
for
travel
and
transmission
of
the
post
the
post
consisting
of
the
chemical
substances
secreted
by
the
glands
to
be
sure
the
doctrine
was
only
an
inference
though
of
which
the
direct
experimental
proof
was
not
to
be
obtained
until
the
researches
of
bayliss
and
starling
yet
to
belongs
the
immortal
credit
if
not
of
the
originator
at
any
rate
of
the
resurrector
of
the
idea
of
using
gland
extracts
to
influence
the
body
the
unwarranted
hopes
aroused
by
his
enthusiastic
reports
of
rejuvenating
miracles
have
long
since
been
dissipated
moreover
they
smeared
the
whole
subject
with
a
disrepute
which
clings
to
certain
narrow
and
unreasonable
minds
to
this
day
but
as
every
physiologist
since
has
acknowledged
he
was
and
remains
the
great
in
the
conquest
of
the
internal
secretions
the
hormones
the
problem
of
the
internal
secretions
was
now
attacked
from
another
angle
a
great
russian
physiologist
pawlow
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
introduction
of
a
dilute
mineral
acid
such
as
the
hydrochloric
acid
normally
a
constituent
of
the
stomach
digestive
fluid
into
the
upper
part
of
the
intestine
provoked
a
secretion
of
the
pancreas
which
is
so
important
for
intestinal
digestion
he
explained
the
phenomenon
as
a
reflex
a
matter
of
the
nerves
going
from
the
intestine
to
the
pancreas
his
pupil
popielski
threw
doubt
upon
so
easy
an
explanation
by
proving
that
the
same
reaction
could
be
elicited
even
after
all
the
nerve
connections
between
the
gut
and
the
spinal
cord
were
severed
if
the
relation
was
a
reflex
it
would
have
to
be
classed
now
as
one
of
those
local
nerve
circuits
which
are
pretty
common
among
the
viscera
a
local
call
and
reply
as
it
were
without
mediation
of
the
great
long
distance
trunk
lines
in
the
spinal
cord
and
the
medulla
oblongata
the
work
of
bayliss
and
starling
two
english
physiologists
was
commenced
then
to
test
the
hypothesis
they
soon
found
that
the
experiment
could
be
so
devised
as
to
exclude
any
influence
whatever
on
the
part
of
the
nervous
tissues
and
yet
result
positively
thus
if
a
loop
of
intestine
was
so
prepared
as
to
be
attached
to
the
rest
of
the
body
only
by
means
of
its
blood
vessels
all
the
nerves
being
cut
putting
some
acid
into
it
was
still
followed
by
a
flow
of
pancreatic
juice
no
less
marked
than
when
none
of
the
parts
about
the
piece
of
gut
had
been
disturbed
it
was
evident
that
the
stimulus
to
the
pancreas
was
carried
by
way
of
the
blood
stream
that
the
stimulating
substance
was
not
the
acid
itself
was
shown
by
the
failure
of
the
reaction
to
occur
when
the
acid
was
injected
directly
into
the
blood
stream
since
there
was
this
difference
in
the
effects
between
acid
in
the
intestine
and
acid
in
the
blood
it
was
manifest
that
the
active
substance
must
be
some
material
elaborated
in
the
intestinal
mucous
membrane
under
the
influence
of
the
acid
so
they
scraped
some
of
the
lining
of
the
bowel
rubbed
it
up
with
acid
and
injected
the
filtered
mixture
into
the
blood
they
were
rewarded
by
a
flow
of
pancreatic
juice
greater
in
amount
than
any
obtained
in
their
other
experiments
from
the
filtered
mixture
they
isolated
in
an
impure
form
a
solid
substance
which
when
introduced
into
the
circulation
has
a
similar
action
to
this
of
which
the
exact
chemical
is
as
yet
an
unknown
they
gave
the
name
secretin
secretin
and
its
properties
they
used
to
generalize
as
a
perfectly
direct
and
amply
demonstrable
example
of
an
internal
secretion
metaphors
are
no
less
valuable
in
physiology
than
in
poetry
they
declared
that
the
internal
secretions
appeared
to
them
to
be
chemical
messengers
telegraph
boys
sent
from
one
organ
to
another
through
the
public
highways
the
blood
really
more
like
a
moving
platform
so
they
christened
them
all
hormones
deriving
the
word
from
the
greek
verb
meaning
to
rouse
or
set
in
motion
as
a
science
is
a
language
a
new
word
is
an
event
it
sums
up
details
economizes
and
so
is
cherished
by
the
intellect
the
study
of
the
internal
secretions
has
advanced
by
leaps
and
bounds
since
it
became
convenient
to
speak
of
them
as
hormones
withal
the
brilliant
work
of
bayliss
and
starling
stands
as
the
third
great
foundation
stone
the
first
claude
bernard
and
the
second
in
the
architecture
of
the
modern
concepts
of
the
internal
secretions
chapter
ii
the
glands
thyroid
and
pituitary
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
the
history
of
which
as
tools
of
thought
i
reviewed
in
the
previous
chapter
have
each
an
interesting
evolutionary
story
without
some
acquaintance
with
that
story
the
rough
outline
of
their
physical
architecture
and
the
particular
work
they
are
called
upon
to
perform
in
the
body
no
adequate
understanding
of
their
influence
upon
types
of
human
nature
and
personality
is
possible
the
thyroid
gland
this
gland
consists
of
two
maroon
colored
masses
astride
the
neck
above
the
windpipe
close
to
the
larynx
these
are
bridged
by
a
narrow
isthmus
of
the
same
tissue
they
remind
one
of
the
flaps
of
a
purse
opened
up
the
gland
has
always
attracted
much
attention
because
its
enlargement
constitutes
the
prominent
deformity
known
as
goitre
to
begin
with
the
thyroid
was
once
a
sex
gland
pure
and
simple
in
the
lowest
vertebrates
and
in
the
homologous
tissues
of
the
higher
invertebrates
the
fractions
of
the
thyroid
are
intimately
connected
with
the
ducts
of
the
sexual
organs
they
are
indeed
accessory
sexual
organs
uterine
glands
satellites
of
the
sex
process
from
petromyzon
upward
that
relationship
is
lost
the
thyroid
migrates
more
and
more
to
the
head
region
to
become
the
great
link
between
sex
and
brain
how
alive
that
function
still
is
is
grossly
shown
by
the
swelling
of
the
gland
with
sexual
excitement
menstruation
and
pregnancy
relative
to
the
body
weight
it
is
largest
in
the
mammalia
and
smallest
in
the
fishes
it
therefore
grows
larger
as
the
vertebrate
ascends
in
the
scale
it
has
in
fact
developed
in
direct
proportion
to
and
side
by
side
with
the
fundamental
differentiating
vertebrate
characteristics
of
these
the
possession
of
a
dry
hairy
skin
instead
of
a
moist
or
mucus
bearing
chitinous
skin
the
ownership
of
an
internal
bony
skeleton
and
a
large
skull
and
a
complicated
development
of
brain
are
the
diagnostic
signs
thyroid
internal
secretion
has
a
very
definite
controlling
relation
to
all
of
them
to
skin
its
hairiness
moisture
and
amount
of
mucus
to
the
growth
and
size
of
the
bones
especially
the
bones
of
the
extremities
and
the
skull
and
to
intelligence
and
the
complexity
of
the
convolutions
of
the
brain
injury
to
the
thyroid
especially
in
growing
animals
is
followed
by
profound
retrogression
or
arrest
of
development
in
skin
skeleton
and
brain
in
the
fishes
and
the
cyclostomes
the
thyroid
is
represented
only
by
some
small
scrubby
patches
little
larger
than
the
heads
of
pins
scattered
along
the
aorta
the
great
blood
vessels
from
the
heart
and
out
a
little
way
along
each
gill
it
becomes
larger
and
more
compact
among
the
amphibians
and
reptiles
but
still
remains
quite
small
large
and
prominent
among
the
birds
and
mammalia
it
is
largest
and
most
prominent
among
the
primates
and
man
it
is
hence
permissible
to
think
of
the
thyroid
as
a
dictator
of
evolution
to
crown
it
as
the
vertebrate

par
excellence
and
to
call
the
typical
vertebrate
brand
marks
secondary
characteristics
in
precisely
the
sense
of
darwin
classing
the
horns
of
cattle
as
secondary
characteristics
in
such
enthusiasm
for
the
thyroid
as
a
determinant
of
evolution
its
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
column
of
fire
by
night
one
should
not
forget
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
in
them
all
we
may
suppose
life
tired
of
inventing
merely
prehensile
destructive
and
reproductive
organs
hit
upon
the
happy
thought
of
contrivances
which
are
in
essence
chemical
factories
to
speed
up
the
rate
of
variation
and
so
of
a
higher
evolution
creator
of
the
land
animal
according
to
this
conception
the
thyroid
played
a
fundamental
part
in
the
change
of
sea
creatures
into
land
animals
experimentally
thyroid
has
been
used
to
transform
one
into
the
other
thus
the
occasional
change
of
a
mexican
axolotl
a
purely
aquatic
newt
breathing
through
gills
into
the
amblystoma
a
terrestrial
salamander
with
spotted
skin
breathing
by
means
of
lungs
has
long
been
known
feeding
the
axolotl
on
thyroid
gland
produces
the
metamorphosis
very
quickly
even
if
the
axolotl
is
kept
in
water
in
the
reptile
house
at
the
london
zoological
gardens
examples
of
the
common
black
axolotl
and
the
pretty
white
variety
are
exhibited
some

nearly
three
inches
long

several
examples
of
the

produced
in
one
of
the

of
oxford
university
and
at
the

by
thyroid
feeding
a
variation
of
the
thyroid
in
the
direction
of
increased

was
probably
responsible
for
the

thyroxin
secretion
of
the
thyroid
under
the
microscope
as
in
the
test
tube
the
thyroid
shows
remarkable
and
unique
features
closed
spherules
lined
by
a
single
layer
of
cells
enclosing
a
gelatinous
material
known
as
colloid
which
stains
deeply
with
acid
dyes
comprise
the
units
of
its
architecture
essentially
it
may
be
pictured
as
a
series
of
jelly
bubbles
secreted
by
outlying
cells
a
relatively
high
percentage
of
iodine
is
the
unique
distinctive
fact
in
its
chemistry
discovered
by
baumann
in
the
presence
of
the
element
has
focused
the
intelligence
of
chemists
upon
the
gland
with
the
consequent
demonstration
of
arsenic
also
in
it
it
was
soon
manifest
that
the
secretion
of
the
gland
was
dependent
upon
the
iodine
content
for
its
activity
active
extracts
of
the
thyroid
like
thyreoglobulin
and
iodothyrin
were
proven
to
contain
iodine
and
to
become
inactive
when
the
iodine
was
removed
efforts
to
isolate
the
iodine
containing
active
principle
in
pure
form
were
fruitless
until
the
work
of
kendall
at
the
mayo
foundation
he
obtained
it
as
a
white
finely
crystalline
odorless
and
tasteless
substance
heat
stable
and
analyzable
the
free
form
separates
as
a
sheaf
of
fine
needles
kendall
at
first
called
it
the
compound
then
named
it
thyroxin
there
are
other
internal
secretions
of
the
thyroid
with
a
function
of
their
own
that
have
no
iodine
but
they
are
secondary
and
obscure
thyroxin
is
accepted
today
as
the
purified
internal
secretion
of
the
thyroid
because
all
the
effects
of
the
whole
gland
may
be
elicited
with
it
thyroxin
produces
results
with
doses
amazingly
minute
compared
with
the
quantity
of
whole
gland
necessary
moreover
a
dose
of
thyroxin
appears
to
last
an
organism
in
need
of
it
over
a
period
of
time
the
other
has
to
be
administered
continuously
studies
with
thyroxin
carried
on
in
recent
years
have
rounded
out
the
whole
concept
of
the
business
of
the
thyroid
in
the
body
economy
one
may
sum
it
up
by
saying
that
the
thyroid
secretion
is
the
controller
of
the
speed
of
the
more
thyroid
one
has
the
faster
one
lives
the
less
one
has
the
more
slowly
one
lives
that
is
not
to
imply
any
direct
proportion
between
the
amount
of
thyroid
secretion
in
an
individual
and
the
length
of
life
to
which
he
is
destined
the
speed
of
living
in
the
chemical
sense
which
is
the
fundamental
sense
and
the
rate
at
which
the
chemical
reactions
go
on
that
constitute
the
process
of
life
are
dependent
upon
the
thyroid
when
the
reactions
go
faster
more
oxygen
and
food
material
are
burned
up
or
oxidized
more
energy
is
liberated
the
metabolic
wheel
rotates
more
quickly
the
individual
senses
feels
thinks
and
acts
more
quickly
likening
one
energy
machine
to
another
the
thyroid
may
be
compared
to
the
accelerator
of
an
automobile
that
is
a
rough
and
superficial
comparison
because
an
accelerator
lets
in
more
of
the
fuel
to
be
burned
up
while
the
thyroid
makes
the
fuel
more
combustible
it
thus
resembles
more
the
primer
for
a
rich
mixture
of
gasoline
and
air
burns
at
a
greater
velocity
than
a
poor
one
but
the
action
of
thyroid
could
really
be
simulated
only
by
some
substance
that
could
be
introduced
into
the
best
possible
of
gasoline
mixtures
to
increase
its
combustibility
by
a
hundred
per
cent
or
more
for
that
is
what
thyroid
will
do
to
our
food
nor
has
it
only
this
destructive
or
combustion
side
withal
there
is
at
the
same
time
a
constructive
action
for
the
process
frees
energy
to
be
used
for
heat
motion
or
other
need
the
thyroid
therefore
in
addition
to
its
rôle
as
an
accelerator
acts
too
as
the
efficient
lubricator
for
energy
transformations
so
we
see
it
as
accelerator
lubricator
and
transformer
of
our
energies
the
gland
of
energy
production
the
isolation
of
thyroxin
has
made
possible
the
determination
of
the
influence
of
the
thyroid
hormone
upon
the
evolution
of
energy
in
any
higher
animal
organism
there
is
for
every
individual
a
constant
known
as
the
metabolic
rate
or
the
combustion
rate
a
reading
of
the
rate
at
which
his
cells
are
consuming
material
for
heat
the
metabolic
rate
is
thus
a
gauge
of
the
energy
pressure
within
the
organism
it
may
be
calculated
by
measuring
the
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
gas
exhaled
during
a
unit
of
time
and
the
number
of
calories
of
heat
radiated
by
the
skin
simultaneously
a
simplified
device
has
lately
rendered
it
practicable
to
make
actual
determinations
by
a
few
readings
of
the
rate
of
oxygen
absorption
by
the
lungs
plummer
also
connected
with
the
mayo
foundation
has
shown
that
what
would
amount
to
less
than
a
grain
of
the
thyroxin
would
more
than
double
the
amount
of
energy
produced
in
a
unit
of
time
to
be
exact
one
milligram
of
thyroxin
increases
the
metabolic
rate
two
per
cent
that
illustrates
some
of
the
power
of
the
internal
secretion
of
the
thyroid
and
its
importance
to
normal
life
the
mobilization
of
energy
but
not
only
is
the
height
of
pressure
of
energy
in
the
cells
controlled
by
the
thyroid
the
mobility
of
that
energy
is
also
controlled
without
it
rapid
and
large
fluctuations
of
energy
output
and
elasticity
and
flexibility
of
energy
mobilization
for
any
sudden
mental
or
muscular
act
let
alone
an
emergency
become
impossible
a
woman
suffering
with
myxedema
the
condition
described
by
the
english
physician
gull
as
a
cretinoid
state
supervening
in
the
adult
life
of
woman
has
an
insufficient
amount
of
thyroxin
in
her
blood
and
tissues
she
is
clumsy
and
awkward
and
will
stumble
when
endeavoring
to
walk
upstairs
any
effort
is
almost
paralyzed
because
the
range
of
fluctuation
of
energy
the
ability
to
mobilize
energy
in
turn
dependent
upon
an
ability
to
increase
the
metabolic
rate
is
limited
in
slang
phrase
she
can
not
step
on
it
her
existence
is
set
to
go
at
a
rate
in
the
neighborhood
of
forty
per
cent
below
the
normal
by
the
administration
of
thyroxin
her
metabolic
rate
can
be
raised
to
any
desired
figure
the
spark
can
be
adjusted
so
to
speak
to
any
point
we
like
and
it
can
be
so
maintained
for
years
in
the
normal
animal
to
be
sure
the
internal
secretion
of
the
thyroid
is
not
absolutely
essential
to
life
so
it
contrasts
with
the
hormone
of
the
minute
parathyroids
placed
so
closely
to
it
a
minimum
dose
of
which
is
absolutely
a
prerequisite
for
continued
life
the
fundamental
chemical
reactions
within
the
cells
occur
in
the
complete
absense
of
thyroxin
but
they
go
on
in
a
relatively
fixed
rigid
and
unvarying
way
confined
within
the
narrow
limits
of
a
constant
figure
under
such
conditions
the
level
of
energy
production
is
bound
to
be
low
and
to
remain
low
and
the
modus
of
its
mobilization
slow
and
unwieldy
with
thyroid
is
introduced
the
trick
of
or
the
speeding
up
of
the
vital
chemical
reactions
through
the
agency
of
an
which
accelerates
the
process
it
is
par
excellence
the
great
catalyst
of
energy
in
the
body
a
catalyst
is
an
intermediary
like
the
trace
of
water
which
will
bring
about
an
explosion
between
dry
oxygen
and
hydrogen
that
without
it
have
stayed
inert
with
the
strongest
currents
of
electricity
thus
it
supplies
a
mechanism
not
only
for
quantity
output
of
that
subtle
reality
we
label
energy
but
also
an
apparatus
for
varying
the
available
amount
of
it
and
for
permitting
the
maximum
range
in
ease
and
rapidity
of
its
utilization
the
thyroid
is
still
another
device
of
life
for
procuring
more
and
more
variation
and
differentiation
its
goal
as
far
as
we
can
peer
through
the
opalescent
screen
upon
which
its
manifestations
quiver
from
another
point
of
view
the
thyroid
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
organ
evolved
for
maintaining
the
same
amount
of
iodine
in
the
blood
as
there
is
in
sea
water
sea
water
was
our
original
habitat
since
like
venus
we
have
all
come
up
out
of
the
sea
the
more
intimate
study
of
the
composition
of
the
blood
has
revealed
the
most
astonishing
parallelism
between
it
and
the
compounds
of
sea
water
the
blood
is
sea
water
to
which
has
been
added
hemoglobin
as
a
pigment
for
carrying
oxygen
to
the
cells
not
in
direct
contact
with
the
atmosphere
nutrients
to
take
the
place
of
the
prey
our
marine
ancestors
gobbled
up
frankly
and
directly
and
white
cells
to
act
as
the
first
line
of
defense
to
keep
the
concentration
of
iodine
in
the
blood
a
constant
the
thyroid
evolved
since
there
is
no
iodine
in
most
foods
and
very
little
in
those
which
do
contain
it
that
a
minimum
amount
of
iodine
in
the
food
is
necessary
to
health
is
shown
by
the
existence
of
goitre
regions
around
some
of
the
great
lakes
in
the
united
states
for
instance
the
water
does
not
contain
enough
iodine
as
a
result
numerous
cases
of
goitre
occur
iodine
in
the
form
of
sodium
iodide
in
small
doses
will
act
as
a
prophylactic
the
amount
of
iodine
in
the
blood
is
about
one
or
two
parts
to
ten
millions
and
that
of
the
liver
is
about
three
or
four
parts
to
ten
millions
since
the
liver
is
the
most
complex
and
active
chemical
factory
in
the
body
its
appropriation
of
a
greater
amount
of
iodine
for
itself
is
understandable
when
thyroxin
is
administered
in
a
single
dose
there
is
a
distinct
lag
in
the
absorption
of
it
by
the
tissues
a
single
dose
does
not
generate
its
maximum
effect
until
the
tenth
day
this
effect
continues
for
about
ten
days
then
there
is
a
gradual
decrease
in
the
intensity
of
reaction
for
another
ten
days
so
that
the
length
of
time
a
single
administration
of
thyroxin
functions
within
the
body
is
about
three
weeks
again
we
have
occasion
to
notice
a
protective
device
of
the
cells
since
the
presence
of
thyroxin
in
the
tissues
determines
the
rate
at
which
they
burn
themselves
up
it
is
obvious
that
if
there
were
no
mechanism
for
retarding
its
action
and
at
need
varying
it
they
really
would
set
fire
to
themselves
that
is
to
say
if
the
tissues
held
a
maximum
of
the
thyroid
internal
secretion
and
had
to
take
up
more
and
more
as
it
was
fed
out
to
them
by
the
thyroid
through
the
blood
the
pressure
of
energy
production
would
attain
the
state
of
a
boiler
without
a
safety
valve
even
if
were
avoided
by
the
ingestion
of
the
largest
quantities
of
foods
rest
for
the
cells
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
the
thyroxin
in
the
tissues
diminishes
after
a
period
of
great
exertion
the
thyroxin
probably
being
carried
back
to
the
thyroid
gland
and
kept
there
as
reserve
until
further
demand
so
it
has
been
discovered
that
during
the
winter
months
the
thyroid
glands
of
beef
sheep
and
hogs
all
contain
much
less
iodine
than
during
the
summer
months
during
the
winter
months
manifestly
more
energy
is
required
to
maintain
body
temperature
hence
the
gland
surrenders
more
of
its
secretion
to
the
tissues
and
so
keeps
less
of
it
itself
there
must
be
too
a
certain
wearing
out
of
the
potency
of
the
iodine
with
time
even
dead
inorganic
catalysts
made
of
simple
elements
wear
out
after
having
been
used
time
and
time
again
though
the
thyroid
is
the
supreme
energizer
life
is
incompatible
with
a
certain
excess
of
it
death
can
be
produced
by
successive
daily
injections
of
its
internal
secretion
but
it
has
besides
the
energizing
effect
certain
formative
and
nervous
influences
equally
marvelous
as
illustrations
there
are
the
cases
of
thyroid
deprivation
in
human
beings
cretinism
and
myxedema
as
well
as
those
in
which
it
is
believed
there
occurs
an
excess
of
the
thyroid
secretion
in
the
blood
and

have
filled
in

some
detail
this
thumbnail
sketch
of

as
it
occurs
in

to
illustrate
how
wide
a
sweep
the

lariat
embraces

bones

and
fat
brain
and
intelligence
growth
and
development
are
modified
precisely
as
the
size
and
shape
of
certain
crystals
are
modified
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
ingredients
in
an
apparently
homogeneous
solution
a
fertilized
ovum
in
which
the
predecessor
of
the
thyroid
gland
is
present
that
is
to
say
in
which
there
is
the
seed
and
soil
for
its
sprouting
looks
the
same
as
one
without
that
formative
material
yet
when
the
time
comes
for
the
internal
secretion
of
the
thyroid
to
put
in
its
oar
in
the
metabolic
game
its
presence
or
absence
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
the
individual
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
the
concentration
of
phosphorus
in
the
brain
was
established
as
significant
the
cry
for
the
emphasis
of
that
fact
was
without
phosphorus
no
thought
is
possible
we
can
much
more
relevantly
declare
that
without
thyroid
no
thought
no
growth
no
distinctive
humanity
or
even
animality
is
possible
for
the
epigram
about
phosphorus
was
bombast
since
it
can
be
declaimed
with
equal
truth
that
without
oxygen
without
carbon
without
nitrogen
without
any
of
the
food
elements
that
go
to
make
up
the
chemical
composition
of
brain
matter
no
thought
is
possible
indeed
if
one
were
set
upon
the
indictment
of
a
single
chemical
element
as
the
begetter
of
consciousness
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
would
have
to
be
copper
there
is
more
copper
in
the
brain
by
a
considerable
degree
than
in
any
other
organ
of
the
body
which
perhaps
will
be
exceedingly
regretted
by
the
patrons
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
soul
who
would
have
it
as
an
emanation
of
a
deposit
in
the
brain
of
silver
at
least
if
not
gold
they
are
like
the
old
lady
who
would
never
permit
herself
to
be
cured
of
her
ailments
except
by
gold
plated
pills
copper
however
is
not
necessary
to
intelligence
without
thyroid
there
can
be
no
complexity
of
thought
no
learning
no
education
no
no
responsive
energy
for
situations
as
well
as
no
physical
unfolding
of
faculty
and
function
and
no
reproduction
of
kind
with
no
sign
of
adolescence
at
the
expected
age
and
no
exhibition
of
sex
tendencies
thereafter
effects
of

how

the

transformed

in

the

will
get

with

one
wonders
what
is
to

the

fate
of
these

cretins

the

a

those

children

the
interests
of

or
their
occupation
and
social
circles
no
one
outside
their
family
knows
that
they
are
cretins
and
the
most
acute
observer
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
suspect
what
a
theme
for
the
reflections
upon
appearances
the
eminent
victorians
loved
there
are
possibilities
the
imagination
may
envisage
one
may
suppose
such
a
cretin
with
all
his
other
ductless

to

under
careful
medical
guidance
no
one
but
himself
is

of
his

him

his
dread

whether
such
an
omission
of

would
entitle
his

to
a
divorce
is
something
courts
will
be
called
upon
to
decide
sooner

cretinism
as
one
manifestation
of
a
soul
without
thyroid
or
without
enough
thyroid
is
not
all
the
first
great
successes
with
thyroid
were
achieved
in
adults
particularly
adult
women
exhibiting
a
peculiar
obesity
coldness
loss
of
hair
and
teeth
and
a
remarkable
lassitude
and
torpor
that
might
be
summed
up
as
a
chronic
drowsiness
like
a
saturation
of
the
blood
with
some
narcotic
drug
or
there
may
be
a
melancholia
or
a
lack
of
ability
to
seize
the
finer
points
of
a
mental
process
or
an
argument
treated
in
the
abstract
children
are
said
to
be
lazy
slow
or
dull
they
experience
an
irritating
difficulty
in
understanding
questions
and
expressing
their
wants
and
desires
and
so
are
declared
to
be
vicious
or
stupid
all
these
are
grades
of
the
degeneration
which
ord
the
englishman
named
myxedema
at
its
worst
it
is
a
sort
of
bloating
and
drying
of
the
body
and
the
mind
then
there
is
infantilism
which
is
helped
by
the
giving
of
thyroid
extract
it
differs
from
the
ordinary
cretinism
in
that
while
one
is
reminded
of
the
latter
by
the
physical
stunting
and
the
other
stigmata
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
intelligence
which
enables
the
individual
to
hold
his
own
while
he
is
a
child
he
becomes
a
baby
at
twenty
prefers
the
company
of
children
of
ten
and
passes
under
the
evil
influence
of
designing
normal
persons
so
dominated
he
will
lie
steal
start
fires
commit
almost
any
crime
with
no
inherent
flair
for
criminality
but
because
of
a
lack
of
independent
judgment
and
inability
to
resist
suggestion
and
a
desire
to
please
friends
he
is
simply
an
overgrown
child
who
still
loves
to
play
with
toys
laughs
and
cries
becomes
angry
or
afraid
unreasonably
and
ridiculously
and
yells
for
mamma
when
thwarted
or
scared
so
much
for
what
happens
when
there
is
not
sufficient
of
the
thyroid
secretion
in
the
blood
and
tissues
now
to
consider
the
effects
of
an
excess
of
it
the
condition
called
hyperthyroidism
as
the
insufficiency
of
it
is
labelled
subthyroidism
too
much
thyroxin
can
be
introduced
into
the
system
of
a
normal
individual
or
even
a
cretin
by
the
simple
administration
of
too
large
doses
or
over
too
long
a
time
also
a
train
of
symptoms
similar
to
those
evoked
by
an
oversecretion
of
the
thyroid
may
be
mobilized
by
the
taking
of
too
much
iodine
great
sorrow
great
joy
a
sudden
severe
jolt
to
the
nervous
equilibrium
sexual
excitement
an
overwhelming
anger
or
grief
may
leave
in
their
wake
a
permanent
hyperthyroidism
the
symptoms
are
the
reverse
of
cretinism
and
myxedema
there
is
an
of
the
nerves
in
place
of
sluggishness
and
an
of
the
whole
organism
to
its
environment
the
heart
action
is
too
fast
and
under
the
slightest
stimulus
gets
faster
to
the
point
of
obtruding
itself
into
the
conscious
mind
as
a
palpitation
instead
of
the
lowered
temperature
and
coldness
of
the
cretin
there
is
a
heightened
temperature
one
or
two
degrees
above
the
normal
and
a
feeling
of
heat
the
individual
has
a
high
warm
color
does
not
sleep
well
becomes
or
remains
thin
no
matter
how
much
he
or
she
eats
is
abnormally
susceptible
sexually
may
suffer
from
a
definite
insomnia
is
emotional
and
perspires
freely
alert
neurotic
or
magnetic
and
imaginative
are
some
of
the
descriptive
adjectives
applicable
the
eyes
are
bright
and
prominent
large
and
beautiful
when
they
have
not
reached
the
stage
entitled
or
they
may
even
become
so
protuberant
and
bulging
as
to
develop
the
expression
of
one
staring
aghast
at
some
ineffable
horror
the
latter
is
the
feature
of
only
the
severest
types
when
there
is
an
associated
goitre
the
combination
designated
as
exopthalmic
goitre
there
are
too
individuals
in
whom
hyperthyroidism
and
hypothyroidism
are
mixed
or
rather
alternate
at
one
time
they
present
the
phenomena
of
the
one
at
another
of
the
other
they
are
the
people
who
complain
of
the
cyclic
quality
of
their
moods
and
purposes
their
mood
will
be
a
heaven
of
exaltation
and
exhilaration
and
then
descend
into
a
slough
of
despond
from
which
they
feel
themselves
inextricable
they
are
always
talking
about
the
ups
and
downs
of
their
mental
states
headache
and
languor
and
fatigability
dry
skin
and
lack
of
appetite
for
food
or
exertion
on
one
day
or
for
one
week
give
way
on
the
next
day
or
for
the
next
week
to
an
energetic
gayety
and
sweaty
flushed
skin
a
prominent
appetite
for
food
and
every
sort
of
activity
driven
to
be
forever
on
the
go
for
one
period
in
the
next
they
feel
like
lying
down
most
of
the
day
with
no
inclination
for
any
life
whatever
the
stage
of
depression
may
go
as
far
as
a
melancholia
the
stage
of
stimulation
as
far
as
mania
they
may
simulate
or
cyclic
insanity
something
restrains
them
and
holds
them
bound
as
in
a
vise
in
the
one
cycle
and
then
they
are
driven
on
beyond
themselves
by
some
invisible
whip
in
the
next
thyroid
as
differentiator
besides
the
action
of
the
thyroid
as
energizer
lubricator
and
growth
catalyzer
it
has
a
remarkable
power
as
a
differentiator
of
tissues
it
determines
the
embryonic
etchings
of
the
different
organs
which
in
their
totality
comprise
the
unique
individual
every
multicellular
animal
must
first
have
existed
as
a
single
cell
the
impregnated
ovum
with
the
body
and
personality
of
the
ovum
the
creature
is
one
and
continuous
literally
something
the
single
cell
has
made
of
itself
by
and
differentiating
in
the
process
the
cell
mass
often
goes
through
stages
which
stand
out
as
individualities
in
themselves
that
appear
on
the
surface
absolutely
unrelated
so
the
caterpillar
and
the
butterfly
to
the
naïve
child
seem
as
far
apart
as
worm
and
bird
in
the
case
of
the
frog
the
tadpole
as
a
first
sketch
seems
completely
an
impossible
and
wild
absurdity
yet
we
know
that
there
is
an
orderly
progression
of
events
a
propagation
of
cells
a
forward
going
arrangement
of
chemical
reactions
that
results
in
expansion
and
intricate
complication
of
the
organism
just
what
the
forces
at
work
in
this
most
mysterious
of
all
natural
processes
are
has
been
an
intellectual
mystery
that
the
best
minds
of
the
race
have
attempted
to
get
rid
of
with
words
like
pangenesis
darwin
words
of
black
mediterranean
or
greek
and
latin
origin
as
allen
upward
has
named
them
always
cover
a
multitude
of
ignorances
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
here
as
in
so
many
other
dark
places
provide
the
open
sesame
to
certain
long
closed
doors
of
biology
they
offer
themselves
to
us
as
the
first
definitely
tangible
agents
which
are
known
to
keep
the
process
of
growth
going
and
undoubtedly
initiate
the
marvelous
unfolding
of
tissues
and
functions
organs
and
faculties
summed
up
as
development
or
differentiation
thus
by
the
direct
feeding
of
thyroid
at
particular
points
in
the
differentiating
history
most
curious
effects
have
been
elicited
if
the
gland
is
made
part
of
the
nutriment
the
bathing
environment
of
the
tadpole
a
hastening
of
its
metamorphosis
is
attained
the
tadpole
lives
not
out
its
day
as
a
tadpole
but
precociously
turns
into
a
frog
but
such
a
frog
it
is
a
miniature
frog
a
dwarf
frog
a
frog
seen
by
looking
through
the
wrong
end
of
the

a
frog
not
magnified
but
micrified
frogs
have
been
so
created
the
size
of
flies
there
has
occurred
a
splitting
of
the
two
reactions
which
ordinarily
go
hand
in
hand
the
reaction
of
growth
which
is
just
brute
increase
of
total
mass
or
weight
and
volume
and
the
reaction
of
differentiation
which
is
the
finer
process
the
picture
is
a
frog
but
a
frog
the
size
of
a
tadpole
a
frog
which
has
missed
its
childhood
adolescence
and
youth
skipping
over
these
transition
stages
into
the
adult
age
as
a
pigmy
it
is
all
as
if
a
baby
were
suddenly
to
grow
a
beard
and
moustache
evolve
and
shed
teeth
and
acquire
the
manner
of
an
earnest
citizen
and
yet
retain
the
height
and
weight
of
a
baby
that
the
spectacle
of
such
a
superbaby
is
not
quite
the
most
fantastic
of
all
improbabilities
is
shown
by
the
condition
of
progeria
first
recorded
by
the
briton
hastings
guilford
a
queer
spectacle
in
which
a
child
incontinently
grows
old
without
having
lived
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
or
months
you
look
upon
him
and
see
senility
on
a
small
scale
but
with
all
its
peculiarities
wrinkled
skin
apathy
gray
hair
and
all
the
rest
of
it
all
we
can
say
about
it
is
that
it
is
probably
due
to
a
paralysis
of
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
a
removal
of
their
influence
upon
the
cells
contrariwise
to
the
feeding
of
thyroid
removal
of
the
thyroid
of
tadpoles
will
prevent
their
development
into
frogs
if
iodine
is
then
fed
to
them
say
mixed
with
flour
normal
metamorphosis
will
occur
if
body
is
the
tool
chest
which
we
carry
about
with
us
as
samuel
butler
said
then
to
the
thyroid
belongs
the
name
of
another
function
of
thyroid
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
is
what
has
been
spoken
of
as
its
antitoxic
function
in
plainer
english
its
power
to
prevent
poisoning
or
to
increase
resistance
against
poisons
including
the
bacteria
and
other
living
agents
which
cause
the
infectious
diseases
each
molecule
of
food
ingested
for
assimilation
into
our
substance
accumulates
a
history
of
wanderings
and
pilgrimages
attachments
and
transformations
beside
which
the
gross
trampings
of
a
marco
polo
become
the
rambling
steps
of
a
booted
giant
in
the
course
of
its
peregrinations
it
becomes
a
potential
poison
potential
because
it
is
never
allowed
to
grow
in
concentration
to
the
danger
point
the
thyroid
plays
its
rôle
of
protector
like
all
the
internal
secretory
machines
in
an
animal
deprived
of
a
thyroid
the
feeding
of
meat
shortens
life
a
single
sample
of
how
it
works
to
guard
against
intoxication
from
within
the
feeding
of
thyroid
will
also
raise
the
ability
of
the
cells
to
stand
poisons
introduced
from
without
intoxications
of
all
sorts
alcohol
and
morphine
will
affect
in
much
smaller
doses
the
subthyroid
person
than
the
normal
or
the
hyperthyroid
as
regards
the
infections
which
directly
or
indirectly
kill
most
of
us
the
injection
of
thyroid
will
increase
the
content
in
the
blood
of
the
protective
antibodies
which
preserve
us
temporarily
at
any
rate
against
malignant
invaders
the
opsonins
for
example
those
substances
which
butter
the
bacteria
so
that
the
appetite
of
the
white
cells
for
them
is
properly
roused
are
mobilized
by
thyroid
feeding
or
injection
other
substances
in
the
blood
which
destroy
and
dissolve
bacteria
are
also
increased
the
thyroid
probably
performs
these
functions
by
sending
its
secretion
to
the
cells
directly
responsible
for
the
immunity
reactions
and
stimulating
them
to
activity
a
sketch
of
the
thyroid
like
the
foregoing
shows
it
as
the
wondrous
controller
of
vitality
and
growth
and
indefatigable
protector
against
intoxicants
and
injuries
when
it
is
sufficiently
active
life
is
worth
while
when
it
is
defective
life
is
a
difficult
threatening
blackness
that
would
make
it
out
as
the
gland
of
glands
it
is
tremendously
important
without
a
doubt
in
normal
everyday
life
but
no
more
so
than
the
other
members
of
the
cast
the
position
of
star
it
may
claim
but
in
vain
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
to
be
sketched
will
each
when
the
marvels
of
its
business
in
the
are
considered
present
itself
as
candidate
for
the
honors
of
the
president
justice
should
give
fair
credit
to
all
the
organs
which
fabricate
the
reagents
of
individuality
and
the
regulators
of
personality
the
pituitary
in
the
human
skull
the
pituitary
is
a
lump
of
tissue
about
the
size
of
a
pea
lying
at
the
base
of
the
brain
a
short
distance
behind
the
root
of
the
nose
it
is
of
a
color
unpretentious
and
insignificant
enough
in
appearance
and
so
long
neglected
by
the
scientists
who
boast
their
immunity
to
the
glamor
of
the
spectacular
guesses
at
its
nature
date
back
to
aristotle
like
most
of
its
colleagues
among
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
it
is
really
two
glands
in
one
two
glands
with
but
a
single
name
at
least
it
consists
of
two
different
parts
distinct
in
their
origin
history
function
and
secretions
but
juxtaposed
and
fused
into
what
is
apparently
a
homogeneous
entity
they
are
conveniently
spoken
of
as
the
anterior
gland
and
the
posterior
gland
in
the
embryo
the
anterior
gland
is
derived
by
a
proliferation
of
cells
from
the
mouth
area
the
posterior
gland
represents
an
outgrowth
of
the
oldest
part
of
the
nervous
system
when
it
is
traced
back
along
the
tree
of
the
vertebrate
species
it
is
found
to
be
present
in
all
of
them
an
ancient
invention
its
precursor
has
been
identified
in
worms
and
molluscs
and
even
among
the
starfish
the
pituitary
is
practically
the
same
from
myxine
to
man
a
trusted
veteran
therefore
among
the
internal
secretory
organs
its
importance
can
be
surmised
to
understand
the
story
of
the
pituitary
variously
acquired
bits
of
information
concerning
it
have
been
assembled
and
fitted
together
like
the
fragments
of
a
picture
puzzle
as
cushing
has
so
well
put
it
here
and
there
pieces
stick
out
obviously
out
of
place
the
relations
of
some
of
them
to
one
another
or
to
the
whole
design
are
not
at
all
clear
parts
appear
to
have
been
irrevocably
lost
or
not
yet
to
have
turned
up
chance
bystanders
will
select
odd
figures
and
articulate
them
into
a
new
harmony
yet
out
of
the
jumble
of
fragments
a
fairly
respectable
insight
has
been
gained
in
less
than
a
half
century
the
pituitary
is
cradled
in
a
niche
at
the
base
of
the
skull
which
because
of
its
form
is
known
as
the
sella
turcica
or
turkish
saddle
so
situated
an
operative
approach
to
it
is
overwhelmingly
difficult
on
the
other
hand
studies
are
favored
nature
darling
treasure
it
might
be
called
since
there
has
been
provided
a
skull
within
the
skull
to
shelter
it
under
the
most
highly
magnifying
lenses
of
the
microscope
three
kinds
of
cells
have
been
distinguished
the
anterior
gland
is
a
collection
of
solid
columns
of
cells
surrounded
by
blood
spaces
into
which
their
secretion
is
undoubtedly
directly
poured
a
gelatinous
material
presumed
to
be
the
internal
secretion
of
the
gland
has
in
fact
been
observed
emerging
from
the
cells
into
the
blood
spaces
the
posterior
lobe
or
gland
consists
of
secreting
cells
producing
a
glassy
substance
which
finds
its
way
into
the
spinal
fluid
that
bathes
the
nervous
system
the
spinal
fluid
itself
is
a
secretion
of
another
gland
at
the
base
of
the
brain
the
choroid
nerves
and
internal
secretion
are
associated
here
with
a
closeness
symbolic
of
their
general
relations
from
each
portion
of
the
gland
to
stick
to
the
accepted
nomenclature
of
speaking
of
the
two
glands
as
one
an
active
substance
has
been
isolated
robertson
an
american
chemist
separated
from
the
anterior
lobe
a
substance
soluble
in
the
fat
solvents
like
ether
and
gasoline
which
he
christened
tethelin
but
smith
has
shown
that
the
active
material
is
soluble
neither
in
boiling
water
nor
in
boiling
alcohol
the
typical
fat
solvent
a
number
of
facts
favor
the
idea
of
the
anterior
lobe
cells
as
stimulants
of
growth
of
bone
and
connecting
and
supporting
tissues
generally
from
the
posterior
lobe
pituitrin
believed
its
internal
secretion
has
been
obtained
in
solution
pituitrin
is
a
substance
of
many
marvelous
functions
in
general
it
controls
the
of
the
tissues
of
involuntary
or
smooth
muscle
fibres
of
the
blood
vessels
and
the
contractile
organs
of
the
body
like
the
intestines
the
bladder
and
uterus
when
injected
it
will
slowly
raise
the
blood
pressure
and
keep
it
raised
for
some
time
and
will
increase
the
flow
of
urine
from
the
kidneys
and
of
milk
from
the
breasts
it
will
also
cause
an
intense
continued
contraction
of
the
bladder
and
the
uterus
it
is
also
said
to
control
the
salt
content
of
the
blood
upon
which
its
electrical
conductivity
and
other
properties
depend
normally
there
is
a
certain
fixed
ratio
of
the
salts
in
the
blood
which
keeps
them
like
the
ratio
in
again
we
have
an
example
of
the
curious
atavism
of
the
internal
secretions
the
thyroid
remember
keeps
the
iodine
concentration
of
the
blood
like
that
of
the
ocean
our
original
habitat
pituitrin
likewise
does
its
part
to
maintain
our
internal
environment
as
near
as
possible
to
what
was
once
the
surrounding
medium
a
substance
somewhat
similar
has
been
found
in
the
skin
glands
of
toads
the
extraordinarily
well
protected
position
of
the
pituitary
its
persistence
throughout
life
and
its
abundant
blood
supply
emphasize
its
vital
importance
no
other
gland
of
internal
secretion
can
adequately
substitute
for
it
complete
expiration
means
death
in
two
or
three
days
with
a
peculiar
lethargy
unsteadiness
of
gait
and
loss
of
appetite
emaciation
and
a
fall
of
temperature
so
that
the
animal
becomes
its
temperature
the
same
as
that
of
the
atmosphere
it
occupies
if
only
part
of
the
anterior
lobe
is
taken
away
there
occurs
a
remarkable
degeneration
of
the
individual
the
degeneration
is
not
a
mucinous
infiltration
of
the
skin
and
the
internal
organs
which
occurs
with
thyroid
deprivation
but
a
fatty
degeneration
with
a
tendency
to
inversion
of
sex
a
singular
somnolence
a
dry
skin
loss
of
hair
a
dull
mentality
sometimes
epilepsy
and
a
noticeable
craving
for
and
tolerance
of
sweets
appear
these
are
but
a
few
of
the
observations
obtained
in
experimental
that
is
underaction
or
insufficient
secretion
of
the
pituitary
produced
by
removing
part
of
the
anterior
gland
if
such
an
experimental
is
started
in
infancy
for
instance
in
puppies
there
is
a
cessation
or
marked
hindering
and
slowing
of
growth
that
is
dwarfs
are
artificially
created
apropos
pathologists
have
shown
that
in
several
true
human
dwarfs
the
gland
is
rudimentary
or
inadequate
all
of
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
evidence
that
the
skeleton
stands
directly
under
the
domination
of
the
pituitary
regulator
of
organic
rhythms
there
are
certain
other
singular
of
the
gland
in
its
relation
to
the
periodic
phenomena
of
the
organism
like
hibernation
sleep
and
the
critical
sex
epochs
of
both
sexes
in
hibernation
or
winter
sleep
the
animal
in
cold
weather
passes
into
a
cataleptic
state
in
which
it
continues
to
breathe
more
deeply
but
more
slowly
than
when
awake
but
shows
no
other
signs
of
consciousness
or
life
a
lowered
blood
pressure
and
a
marked
insensitivity
to
painful
and
emotional
stimuli
go
with
it
there
is
a
preliminary
storage
of
starch
in
the
liver
and
of
fat
throughout
the
fat
depots
of
the
body
these
are
so
like
what
happens
after
part
of
the
pituitary
is
removed
that
a
comparison
of
the
two
becomes
inevitable
common
to
both
conditions
is
a
drop
in
the
rate
of
tissue
combustion
or
metabolism
which
can
be
relieved
by
injection
of
an
extract
of
the
pituitary
a
rise
of
temperature
occuring
simultaneously
moreover
examination
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
of
hibernating
species
like
the
woodchuck
during
the
period
of
hibernation
shows
changes
in
all
of
them
but
most
marked
in
the
pituitary
the
shrunken
cells
staining
as
if
they
too
were
asleep
or
in
a
resting
stage
the
characteristic
alive
qualities
of
these
cells
return
without
relation
to
food
or
climate
when
the
animal
comes
to
in
the
spring
at
the
vernal
equinox
hibernation
may
perhaps
be
put
down
to
a
seasonal
wave
of
inactivity
of
the
pituitary
gland
now
winter
sleep
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
exaggeration
of
ordinary
night
sleep
the
latter
differing
from
the
former
only
in
its
brevity
in
the
natural
sleep
of
species
there
occurs
too
a
fall
in
temperature
moreover
they
all
even
man
have
a
certain
capacity
for
winter
sleep
as
the
experiences
of
travellers
and
explorers
in
the
arctic
regions
indicate
in
certain
parts
of
russia
where
there
is
a
scarcity
of
food
during
the
winter
months
the
peasants
pass
weeks
at
a
time
in
a
somnolent
state
arousing
once
a
day
for
a
scant
meal
just
as
the
sex
glands
influence
the
body
and
mind
profoundly
with
a
certain
cyclic
periodicity
of
activity
and
inactivity
rut
heat
menstrual
period
and
so
on
which
has
been
demonstrated
to
have
a
very
close
functional
relationship
with
the
pituitary
so
sleep
and
hibernation
will
bear
interpretation
as
products
of
a
temporary
dormancy
of
the
same
gland
we
have
then
to
set
up
in
the
place
of
morpheus
and
apollo
the
new
gods
of
the
internal
secretion
of
a
bit
of
the
brain
as
an
explanation
of
the
rhythms
of
sleep
and
wakefulness
there
are
individuals
who
go
about
outside
of
hospital
walls
who
are
or
partial
hibernators
and
who
are
really
in
a
state
of
subpituitarism
they
are
people
who
may
have
something
wrong
or
inferior
with
their
pituitary
but
not
to
the
extent
of
interference
with
their
daily
life
they
go
about
with
their
type
stamped
upon
them
for
the
seeing
eye
the
classical
type
is
obese
with
fat
distributed
everywhere
but
more
so
in
the
lower
abdomen
and
the
lower
extremities
they
are
slow
and
dull
and
sexually
inactive
often
impotent
they
are
sometimes
tall
but
most
often
dwarfish
and
may
be
subject
to
epileptic
seizures
they
recall
the
picture
of
what
happens
to
young
dogs
partially
deprived
of
the
pituitary
dickens
delivered
a
perfect
likeness
of
an
extreme
degree
of
the
condition
in
the
fat
boy
of
the
pickwick
papers
whose
employment
with
wardle
consisted
in
alternate
sleeping
and
eating
when
the
pituitary
overacts
all
grades
of
overaction
of
the
pituitary
exist
then
its
peculiar
power
to
act
as
a
stimulant
to
the
growth
of
bone
and
the
soft
supporting
and
connecting
tissues
like
tendons
and
ligaments
comes
into
play
if
the
overaction
or
excess
of
secretion
begins
in
childhood
or
adolescence
that
is
before
puberty
there
results
a
great
elongation
of
the
bones
so
that
a
giant
is
the
consequence
now
giants
have
always
appealed
to
the
imagination
of
the
little
man
and
have
had
all
kinds
of
wonderful
abilities
ascribed
to
them
by
him
the
giants
and
ogres
of
and
fairy
tales
are
favored
with
the
most
extraordinary
mental
advantages
direct
and
analytic
acquaintance
with
the
giants
of
our
own
day
as
well
as
a
probing
of
their
conduct
in
the
past
has
shown
that
normal
giants
persons
of
exceptional
size
free
from
physical
or
mental
deformities
are
rare
there
are
people
with
who
exhibit
the
highest
mental
powers
in
them
is
an
increased
activity
of
the
posterior
lobe
in
association
with
enlargement
and
hyperfunction
of
the
anterior
overgrowth
is
not
so
marked
and
the
individual
is
lean
and
mentally
acute
but
the
ordinary
giant
is
one
in
whom
there
is
degeneration
of
the
pituitary
after
too
much
action
of
the
anterior
and
too
little
of
the
posterior
glands
a
tumor
or
disease
process
in
the
gland
is
most
often
responsible
if
the
overaction
of
the
anterior
happens
after
puberty
when
the
long
bones
have
set
and
can
not
grow
longer
a
peculiar
diffuse
enlargement
of
the
individual
occurs
especially
of
his
hands
and
feet
and
head
the
nose
ears
lips
and
eyes
get
larger
and
coarser
as
these
people
are
rather
big
and
tall
to
begin
with
the
effect
produced
is
that
of
a
burly
bulking
person
with
bushy
overhanging
eyebrows
and
an
aggressive
manner
for
there
is
too
something
distinctive
about
their
mentality
which
has
been
as
often
portrayed
as
those
of
the
pathologic
giant
rabelais
most
famous
character
gargantua
belongs
to
the
group
we
recruit
more
than
prime
ministers
from
among
these
people
they
often
suffer
much
from
torturing
boring
headaches
and
a
consequent
despondency
and
feeling
of
hopelessness
which
colors
gray
the
entire
spiritual
spectrum
up
to
a
certain
point
these
sufferers
have
a
remarkable
alertness
and
capacity
when
conscious
of
the
malady
they
often
meet
it
with
a
doggedly
courageous
optimism
which
is
another
characteristic
although
women
occasionally
commit
suicide
in
both
the
who
remind
one
of
cattle
and
in
the
giant
or
acromegalic
types
who
remind
one
of
the
anthropoid
ape
there
develops
a
distinct
diminution
of
sexual
life
an
abnormal
process
in
the
anterior
gland
whether
of
oversecretion
or
of
undersecretion
may
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
posterior
gland
the
secretion
of
which
is
tonic
not
only
to
the
brain
cells
but
also
to
the
sex
cells
thus
young
animals
deprived
of
the
pituitary
will
not
if
male
grow
spermatozoa
nor
ripe
ova
in
the
female
moreover
the
feeding
of
pituitary
increases
sexual
activity
in
the
case
of
hens
this
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
about
thirty
per
cent
by
a
pretty
experiment
at
a
time
of
the
year
when
eggs
diminish
six
hundred
and
hens
laid
two
hundred
and
eggs
upon
an
ordinary
diet
when
pituitary
was
added
to
their
food
for
four
days
the
number
of
eggs
rose
to
three
hundred
and
an
increase
of
in
addition
the
fertility
of
the
chicks
born
of
these
eggs
was
augmented
especially
if
both
parents
had
been
fed
on
pituitary
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
relation
of
the
pituitary
to
sex
which
will
be
treated
in
another
chapter
the
bony
cradle
of
the
pituitary
always
in
attempting
to
understand
the
pituitary
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
it
is
tightly
packed
in
the
bony
cradle
the
turkish
saddle
or
sella
turcica
should
some
stimulus
local
or
in
the
blood
arouse
the
gland
to
growth
a
good
deal
will
depend
upon
whether
it
has
room
to
grow
in
or
it
will
make
room
by
eroding
the
bone
with
space
for
the
formation
of
a
large
anterior
and
posterior
pituitary
gland
there
will
be
created
the
long
lean
individual
with
a
tendency
to
high
blood
pressure
and
sexual
trends
great
mental
activity
initiative
irritability
and
endurance
an
outstanding
trait
of
these
favorites
of
fortune
is
that
they
remain
thin
no
matter
how
much
food
they
consume
and
they
have
the
best
of
appetites
they
often
are
subject
to
severe
headaches
because
of
intermittent
swelling
of
the
gland
against
the
bone
of
its
container
if
the
bony
container
is
or
becomes
too
small
for
its
contents
it
is
interesting
that
along
with
the
other
signs
of
pituitary
insufficiency
such
as
undersize
obesity
and
asymmetry
there
developes
conspicuous
moral
and
intellectual
inferiority
the
unfortunates
suffer
from
compulsions
and
obsessions
and
lack
inhibitions
they
are
the
pathological
liars
with
little
or
no
initiative
or
conscience
amoral
not
merely
theoretically
but
instinctively
and
unconsciously
with
all
the
certitude
and
perfection
of
the
unconscious
accomplishment
thyroid
and
pituitary
the
thyroid
and
the
pituitary
have
often
been
compared
the
anterior
gland
and
the
thyroid
arise
from
almost
the
same
spot
in
the
embryonic
oesophagus
the
thyroid
being
an
outgrowth
in
front
the
anterior
pituitary
an
outgrowth
behind
of
the
same
soil
they
both
control
growth
marvelously
also
the
differentiation
the
mass
and
intricacy
of
the
tissues
but
they
differ
in
the
site
of
their
control
the
thyroid
bears
more
directly
upon
the
inner
and
outer
coverings
of
the
body
the
skin
the
skin
glands
and
the
hair
the
mucous
membranes
and
the
irritability
and
the
preparedness
for
response
of
the
nerves
the
pituitary
acts
more
upon
the
framework
of
the
body
the
skeleton
and
the
mechanical
supports
and
movers
bone
and
ligament
muscle
and
tendon
seem
to
be
within
its
immediate
sway
the
secretion
or
secretions
of
the
pituitary
diffuse
directly
into
the
fluid
bathing
the
nervous
system
supplying
beneficent
stimulants
and
aiding
in
the
abstraction
of
harmful
waste
so
while
the
thyroid
raises
the
energy
level
of
the
brain
and
the
whole
nervous
system
as
a
byproduct
of
its
general
awakening
effect
upon
all
the
cells
of
the
body
the
pituitary
probably
stimulates
the
brain
cells
more
directly
perhaps
in
the
manner
of
caffeine
or
cocaine
the
difference
between
the
thyroid
and
the
pituitary
might
be
put
this
way
that
while
the
thyroid
increases
energy
evolution
and
so
makes
available
a
greater
supply
of
crude
energy
by
speeding
up
cellular
processes
the
pituitary
assists
in
energy
transformation
in
energy
expenditure
and
conversion
especially
of
the
brain
and
of
the
sexual
system
in
short
the
thyroid
facilitates
energy
production
the
pituitary
its
consumption
the
pituitary
appears
therefore
as
the
gland
of
continued
effort
hence
fatigability
an
inability
to
maintain
effort
is
one
of
the
prominent
complaints
when
there
is
destruction
or
an
insufficiency
of
it
for
one
reason
or
another
as
such
it
contrasts
with
the
glands
of
emergency
effort
known
as
the
adrenals
chapter
iii
the
adrenal
glands
the
gonads
and
thymus
like
the
pituitary
each
adrenal
gland
is
a
double
gland
that
is
consists
of
two
distinct
portions
united
together
one
might
say
by
the
accident
of
birth
it
would
be
confusing
however
to
speak
of
each
as
two
glands
because
there
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
separate
adrenal
glands
one
in
the
right
side
of
the
abdomen
and
the
other
in
the
left
each
gland
is
composite
or
duplex
how
the
two
parts
came
to
be
united
is
a
long
story
interesting
but
too
long
to
be
recounted
here
in
fishes
they
are
apart
and
independent
each
adrenal
is
a
cocked
hat
shaped
affair
astride
the
kidneys
easily
recognized
because
of
its
yellowish
fatty
color
indeed
for
centuries
the
glands
were
not
given
a
separate
status
as
organs
but
were
passed
up
as
part
of
the
fat
ensheathing
the
kidney
in
childhood
and
youth
in
common
with
the
other
glands
they
are
relatively
larger
and
more
prominent
than
in
the
adult
also
at
every
age
the
amount
of
blood
passing
through
them
is
very
large
compared
to
their
size
their
tremendous
importance
in
the
body
economy
accounts
for
their
being
so
favored
the
two
parts
of
which
each
gland
is
composed
are
known
as
the
cortex
or
outer
portion
literally
the
bark
and
the
medulla
or
inner
portion
literally
the
core
no
boundary
sharply
delimits
the
two
as
strands
and
peninsulas
of
tissue
of
one
portion
penetrate
the
other
in
the
history
of
their
development
in
the
species
and
the
individual
and
in
their
chemistry
and
function
a
sharp
difference
contrasts
them
in
the
embryo
the
cortex
is
derived
from
the
same
patch
that
gives
rise
to
the
sex
organs
the
ovaries
in
the
female
and
the
testes
in
the
male
described
as
the
germinal
epithelium
how
intimately
the
two
sets
of
glands
are
connected
is
neatly
pointed
by
this
fact
of
a
common
ancestor
all
vertebrates
possess
adrenal
glands
in
the
lowest
of
the
vertebrates
petromyzon
the
two
parts
are
distinct
the
cells
of
the
are
situated
in
the
walls
of
the
kidney
blood
vessels
projecting
as
peninsulas
in
the
blood
stream
the
blood
sweeping
over
and
past
them
the
consists
of
cells
accompanying
the
vegetative
nerves
among
reptiles
the
two
become
adjacent
for
the
first
time
and
among
birds
one
part
occupies
the
meshes
of
the
other
the
size
of
the
cortex
varies
directly
with
the
sexuality
and
the
pugnacity
of
the
animal
the
charging
buffalo
for
example
owns
a
strikingly
wide
adrenal
cortex
the
fleeing
rabbit
on
the
other
hand
is
conspicuous
for
a
narrow
strip
of
cortex
in
its
adrenal
human
beings
possess
a
cortex
larger
than
that
of
any
other
animal
no
definite
chemical
substance
has
as
yet
been
isolated
from
the
cortex
that
remains
a
problem
for
the
investigator
of
the
future
but
certain
observations
especially
concerning
the
relation
between
the
development
and
behaviour
of
the
secondary
sex
characteristics
those
qualities
of
skin
hair
and
fat
distribution
physical
configuration
and
mental
attitudes
which
distinguish
the
sexes
and
the
condition
of
the
gland
indicate
clearly
that
an
internal
secretion
will
be
isolated
and
that
it
will
in
its
activity
furnish
certain
predictable
features
three
different
layers
of
cells
arranged
in
strings
that
interpenetrate
to
form
a
network
directly
bathed
by
blood
that
breaks
in
upon
them
from
blood
vessels
compose
the
cortex
most
remarkable
is
this
method
of
blood
supply
for
it
is
exceedingly
common
among
the
invertebrates
and
rare
among
the
vertebrates
in
certain
disturbances
of
these
glands
especially
when
there
are
tumors
which
supply
a
massive
dose
of
the
secretion
to
the
blood
presumably
peculiar
sex
phenomena
and
general
developmental
anomalies
and
irregularities
are
produced
if
the
disease
be
present
in
the
fetus
taking
hold
before
birth
and
so
brought
into
the
world
with
the
child
there
evolves
the
condition
of
the
individual
if
a
female
presents
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
external
habits
and
character
of
the
other
sex
so
that
she
is
actually
taken
for
a
man
although
the
primary
sex
organs
are
ovaries
often
not
discovered
to
be
such
except
when
examined
after
an
operation
or
death
how
closely
such
an
occurrence
touches
upon
the
problems
of
sex
inversion
and
perversion
comes
at
once
to
mind
if
the
process
involving
the
adrenal
cortex
attacks
it
after
birth
the
symmetrical
correspondence
and
harmony
of
the
primary
sex
organs
and
the
secondary
sex
characters
are
not
affected
but
there
follows
a
curious
hastening
of
the
ripening
of
body
and
mind
summed
up
in
the
word
puberty
a
precocious
puberty
with
the
most
startling
effects
a
little
girl
of
or
years
of
age
perhaps
will
come
to
exhibit
the
growth
and
appearance
of
a
girl
of
she
begins
to
menstruate
her
breasts

she
shoots

of
the
adolescent

a

bewitched
into
puberty
a
boy
of
six
or
seven
may
suddenly
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
or
months
become
a
little
man
robust
rather
short
and
stocky
but
moustached
with
the
muscular
strength
and
sexual
powers
of
a
man
and
thinking
as
a
man
it
is
all
as
if
into
some
fermentable
medium
or
solution
a
little
yeast
were
dropped
that
changed
the
quiet
calm
of
its
surface
into
a
bubbling
effervescing
revolution
it
suggests
at
once
that
maturation
the
transformation
of
the
child
into
the
man
or
woman
must
be
due
to
the
pouring
into
the
blood
and
the
body
fluids
of
some
substance
which
acts
like
the
yeast
in
the
fermentable
solution
the
adrenal
cortex
is
one
source
of
the
internal
secretions
if
trouble
in
the
adrenal
cortex
starts
after
puberty
phenomena
of
the
same
type
but
of
a
different
order
exhibit
themselves
a
woman
say
in
the
thirties
becomes
thus
afflicted
slowly
or
quickly
her
body
will
be
covered
by
an
abundant
growth
of
hair
more
or
less
of
a
beard
and
moustache
appear
upon
the
face
her
voice
will
become
deep
and
penetrating
her
muscles
will
harden
and
she
will
show
a
capacity
for
hard
physical
labor
sexually
she
appears
to
be
made
over
masculinity
now
predominates
in
her
virilism
is
the
name
by
which
the
french
in
particular
have
popularized
the
knowledge
of
the
condition
virilists
have
to
shave
or
be
shaved
regularly
and
are
not
bothered
in
the
least
by
the
cares
responsibilities
jealousies
and
anxieties
of
personal
beauty
for
the
change
in
their
spirituality
makes
them
immune
to
the
preoccupations
of
the
feminine
the
cause
of
such
a
transformation
in
a
previously
entirely
normal
woman
has
been
found
to
be
a
tumor
of
the
adrenal
cortex
but
not
only
is
sexuality
and
the
conduct
of
the
secondary
sex
characters
connected
with
the
adventures
of
the
adrenal
cortex
the
development
of
the
master
tissues
of
the
body
the
brain
the
pride
and
darling
of
evolution
is
in
some
subtle
way
correlated
with
it
the
adrenal
cortex
contains
more
of
the
substances
of
the
general
nature
of
those
found
in
the
central
nervous
system
than
any
other
gland
or
tissues
in
the
body
during
human
intrauterine
life
the
adrenal
glands
are
large
and
conspicuous
in
the
first
half
of
the
second
month
being
twice
as
large
as
the
kidneys
most
of
this
relatively
huge
size
which
happens
in
the
human
alone
and
not
in
other
animals
is
due
to
enlargement
of
the
cortex
should
this
preponderance
of
the
cortex
over
the
medullary
portion
not
occur
in
the
human
that
is
if
the
proportions
remain
like
those
of
other
animals
the
brain
fails
to
develop
properly
or
an
entirely
brainless
monster
is
generated
the
human
brain
therefore
probably
owes
its
superiority
over
the
animal
brain
to
the
adrenal
cortex
in
development
anyhow
the
growth
of
the
brain
cells
their
number
and
complexity
is
thus
controlled
by
the
adrenal
cortex
besides
its
action
upon
the
sex
cells
and
the
brain
cells
the
internal
secretion
of
the
adrenal
cortex
acts
upon
the
pigment
cells
of
the
skin
blunting
their
sensitiveness
to
light
in
degeneration
of
the
interior
of
the
gland
which
destroys
the
medulla
but
not
the
cortex
the
color
of
the
skin
is
left
unmodified
if
however
the
cortex
is
invaded
as
happens
most
often
in
the
classical
tuberculosis
of
the
adrenals
which
drew
the
attention
of
the
englishman
addison
to
them
then
a
darkening
of
the
skin
which
may
go
on
to
a
negroid
bronzing
follows
that
means
an
increased
sensitiveness
of
the
pigment
cells
of
the
skin
to
light
skin
color
control
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
an
adrenal
cortex
function
so
much
is
known
about
the
adrenal
cortex
upon
the
medulla
the
interior
gland
of
the
gland
there
has
been
lavished
an
amount
of
attention
beside
which
the
cortex
is
to
be
classed
as
a
neglected
nearly
everything
that
possibly
could
be
determined
about
an
internal
secretion
has
in
its
case
been
settled
or
plausibly
guessed
at
the
cells
manufacturing
the
secretion
its
exact
chemistry
and
function
its
action
upon
the
blood
the
liver
and
spleen
the
heart
and
lungs
the
brain
and
nervous
system
have
been
minutely
investigated
studied
and
charted
its
source
in
the
food
its
fate
in
the
body
its
place
in
the
history
of
the
individual
and
the
species
its
importance
as
a
weapon
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
have
been
made
the
subject
of
an
astonishing
number
of
researches
considering
the
short
period
of
scarce
three
decades
that
intensive
science
has
centered
its
barrage
upon
it
in
the
first
place
the
medulla
contains
numerous
nerve
cells
belonging
to
the
vegetative
also
called
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
but
these
nerve
cells
are
merely
minor
notes
of
the
symphony
the
motif
is
settled
by
a
majority
of
large
granular
cells
which
stain
a

the

is
fixed
in
a
solution
of
bichromate
of
potash
all
chromium
salts
in
fact
stain
the
therefore
labelled
chromaffin
cells
the
characteristic
staining
power
appears
to
be
dependent
upon
or
correlated
with
the
presence
of
the
internal
secretion
of
the
medulla
of
the
adrenal
adrenalin
for
the
content
of
adrenalin
as
calculated
chemically
and
the
depth
of
stain
as
seen
under
the
microscope
rise
and
fall
together
chromaffin
reaction
and
adrenalin
content
go
together
the
poisonous
skin
glands
of
the
toad
have
been
found
to
give
a
marked
chromaffin
reaction
and
to
contain
a
large
amount
of
adrenalin
other
masses
of
cells
in
the
human
body
especially
along
the
course
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
have
been
shown
to
give
the
reaction
and
to
contain
adrenalin
the
erratic
pounded
and
hammered
away
for
more
than
thirty
years
on
the
importance
to
life
of
the
adrenal
glands
since
death
occurred
so
quickly
after
their
removal
but
it
was
not
until
schaefer
the
scotch
physiologist
who
has
done
more
than
any
other
living
man
to
stimulate
study
of
the
internal
secretions
found
that
an
extract
of
them
when
injected
into
a
vein
produced
a
remarkable
though
temporary
rise
of
the
blood
pressure
that
a
real
enthusiasm
for
its
investigation
was
generated
as
the
upshot
a
number
of
other
significant
properties
besides
the
first
of
raising
have
been
put
down
to
its
credit
chemical
tests
demonstrated
that
it
originated
in
the
medulla
the
exact
amount
of
it
present
in
the
medulla
in
the
blood
issuing
from
the
adrenals
and
in
the
circulation
in
general
have
been
determined
the
concentration
in
the
blood
is
about
one
part
in
twenty
million
while
there
is
about
a
hundred
thousand
times
as
much
stored
in
the
gland
as
reserve
in
infections
and
intoxications
after
muscular
exertion
and
with
profound
emotions
there
is
a
decrease
of
it
in
the
gland
and
an
increase
in
the
blood
pain
and
excitement
especially
fear
and
rage
will
bring
about
its
discharge
from
the
gland
with
its
entry
into
the
blood
there
is
a
tremendous
heightening
of
the
tone
a
of
the
nervous
system
the
nerve
cells
become
more
sensitive
to
stimuli
more
sugar
is
poured
into
the
blood
from
the
liver
more
red
blood
corpuscles
are
squeezed
into
the
circulation
from
the
blood
lakes
of
the
liver
and
spleen
there
is
a
redistribution
of
the
whole
blood
mass
a
good
deal
of
it
being
withdrawn
from
the
internal
viscera
and
hurried
to
the
skeleton
muscles
and
the
brain
the
heart
beats
more
strongly
the
eye
sees
more
clearly
the
ear
hears
more
distinctly
and
the
breathing
is
more
rapid
the
temperature
rises
the
hair
of
the
head
and
the
body
becomes
erect
the
skin
gets
moist
and
greasy
it
will
help
a
fatigued
muscle
to
regain
its
normal
tone
in
short
it
has
a
reinforcing
action
upon
the
nutritive
properties
of
the
blood
the
tone
of
the
muscles
and
the
activity
of
the
brain
and
the
vegetative
nerves
chemists
set
themselves
the
task
of
discovering
just
what
was
the
substance
possessed
of
such
extraordinary
and
hitherto
unimagined
properties
the
pure
adrenalin
was
isolated
capable
of
evoking
all
the
reactions
of
the
impure
adrenal
extract
mixtures
the
final
triumph
was
the
preparation
of
it
artificially
in
the
laboratory
its
synthesis
when
a
substance
can
be
synthesized
in
the
laboratory
it
means
that
its
composition
has
become
thoroughly
understood
here
at
last
was
an
example
of
those
mysterious
internal
secretions
the
existence
of
which
had
indeed
been
postulated
and
proven
but
which
had
never
actually
been
inspected
by
the
eye
of
mortal
man
to
have
it
in
a
indeed
to
possess
it
in
large
quantities
in
bottles
to
be
able
to
manipulate
and
examine
it
without
fear
of
the
of
admixed
impurities
to
see
it
with
the
eye
and
to
taste
it
with
the
tongue
was
truly
a
marvel
the
miracle
aroused
at
once
scores
of
researches
the
gland
of
combat
and
fight
considering
its
effects
one
is
reminded
at
once
of
the
similarity
to
the
expression
of
a
primitive
emotion
like
anger
or
fear
so
by
turning
a
relation
upside
down
it
was
argued
that
if
artificial
adrenalin
could
produce
all
these
effects
of
an
emotion
like
fear
the
emotion
itself
should
produce
an
increase
of
the
natural
adrenalin
in
the
blood
this
was
found
to
be
the
case
cannon
of
harvard
has
built
up
an
entire
theory
of
the
adrenal
as
the
gland
of
emergencies
upon
the
basis
of
these
effects
in
the
facing
of
crises
the
adrenal
functions
as
the
gland
of
combat
and
indeed
as
i
have
mentioned
the
more
combative
and
pugnacious
an
animal
the
more
adrenal
it
has
while
the
timid
and
meek
and
weak
have
less
the
glands
of
combat
the
glands
of
emergency
energy
the
glands
of
preparedness
such
are
the
adrenal
glands
when
viewed
from
the
adrenalin
standpoint
a
picture
of
its
activity
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
of
struggle
and
survival
is
something
like
the
following
meeting
an
enemy
the
animal
is
put
in
danger
it
must
fight
or
flee
for
its
life
in
either
case
certain
conditions
must
be
fulfilled
if
the
body
of
the
animal
endangered
is
to
be
saved
to
prevent
injury
to
itself
and
to
do
as
much
injury
as
possible
to
the
foe
that
becomes
its
immediate
urge
and
necessity
of
the
two
animals
if
in
one
the
heart
should
begin
to
beat
more
strongly
the
blood
pressure
to
rise
the
blood
to
flow
more
rapidly
through
the
attacking
instruments
the
muscles
the
teeth
and
claws
the
brain
and
its
eyes
while
the
other
animal
experiences
none
of
these
the
former
will
be
the
victor
in
fight
or
flight
adrenalin
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
invention
for
the
mobilization
at
a
moment
notice
or
as
we
say
after
generations
of
use
by
instinct
of
all
these
visceral
and
blood
advantages
in
the
struggle
of
combat
or
flight
the
nature
of
instinct
in
its
relation
to
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
is
a
problem
for
another
chapter
but
we
may
note
that
the
theory
of
an
emotion
regards
it
as
a
consciousness
of
the
very
changes
in
the
organism
adrenalin
causes
since
adrenalin
is
the
starter
of
the
whole
process
and
since
mcdougal
has
defined
emotion
as
the
feeling
aspect
of
an
instinct
just
as
an
instinct
may
be
defined
as
the
motor
aspect
of
an
emotion
the
adrenals
as
and
play
a
part
in
the
most
profound
processes
of
the
subconscious
and
unconscious
the
mechanism
of
fear
we
may
therefore
visualize
a
mechanism
of
fear
an
instant
excess
of
adrenalin
occurs
in
the
blood
of
say
a
cat
when
it
is
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
a
dog
in
that
cat
at
the
image
of
its
hereditary
enemy
certain
brain
cells
vibrate
a
nerve
tract
in
use
as
the
line
for
that
particular
message
in
a
hundred
thousand
generations
of
cats
whirrs
its
yell
to
the
medulla
of
the
adrenal
gland
through
the
tiny
solitary
veins
of
the
glands
an
infinitesimal
quantity
of
the
reserve
adrenalin
responds
and
with
what
an
effect
the
blood
that
primary
medium
of
life
the
precious
fluid
that
is
everything
must
all
or
nearly
all
be
sent
to
the
firing
line
the
battle
trenches
the
brain
and
muscles
now
or
never
so
the
blood
is
drafted
from
the
industries
from
the
skin
where
it
serves
normally
to
regulate
the
heat
of
the
body
from
the
digestive
organs
the
stomach
and
intestine
which
must
forsooth
stop
now
since
if
the
organism
will
die
their
last
effort
of
digestion
has
been
done
from
the
liver
and
spleen
great
chemical
factories
in
normal
times
but
now
of
no
moment
besides
should
they
be
wounded
it
is
better
they
should
be
bloodless
and
so
run
the
least
chance
of
bleeding
to
death
or
getting
infected
for
the
more
tissue
there
is
around
the
greater
the
danger
of
infection
so
like
the
skin
the
liver
which
usually
holds
in
its
great
lakes
and
vessels
about
a
quarter
of
all
the
blood
in
the
body
is
almost
drained
and
blanched
at
the
same
time
its
great
storehouses
of
sugar
open
their
sluices
and
pour
into
the
blood
increasing
its
sugar
content
by
about
a
third
because
the
combustion
of
sugar
is
the
easiest
way
of
getting
energy
free
in
the
cells
sugar
being
the
most
quickly
burned
up
of
all
the
foods
and
so
the
great
food
of
the
muscles
and
the
heart
the
poisons
of
fatigue
acid
products
of
the
contraction
of
muscles
are
antagonized
and
neutralized
by
substances
formed
in
the
course
of
the
oxidation
of
the
sugar
adrenalin
too
is
directly
fatigue
antagonist
it
causes
the
blood
to
clot
faster
than
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
erects
the
hair
of
the
animal
and
dilates
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
there
is
an
increase
of
the
apparent
size
all
of
which
are
to
intimidate
the
enemy
like
an
indian
painting
of
his
face
blue
and
green
it
also
but
what
else
does
it
not
do
the
story
of
adrenalin
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
samuel
butler
his
note
books
opulent
as
they
are
would
have
been
the
richer
in
pages
and
pages
with
his
comments
on
it
contending
as
he
did
with
the
pompous
dogmatic
mechanism
worship
of
the
new
scientific
clique
of
his
time
on
the
one
hand
and
the
superstitions
of
the
old
theological
caste
on
the
other
he
had
to
fight
the
hardest
kind
of
guerrilla
warfare
in
defense
of
the
purpose
of
life
adrenalin
that
weapon
of
a
gland
tracing
its
ancestry
back
to
the
begetter
of
the
brain
itself
for
brain
and
adrenal
gland
both
have
evolved
from
the
small
nerve
ganglia
of
the
invertebrates
would
have
backed
up
to
the
hilt
his
argument
which
he
had
to
elaborate
on
the
indirect
grounds
of
analogy
and
induction
essential
for
defense
and
for
protection
an
organ
in
which
everything
necessary
for
the
stratagems
of
retreat
or
the
offensives
of
attack
are
supplied
ad
libitum
while
everything
or
detrimental
to
the
matter
of
the
moment
is
inhibited
arrested
and
suppressed
no
more
perfect
sample
of
the
design
with
which
life
is
drenched
could
be
imagined
by
the
most
closeted
of
passionate
idealists
failure
of
the
adrenals
as
the
gland
of
acute
stress
and
strain
the
adrenals
in
modern
life
are
called
upon
to
function
more
heavily
and
frequently
than
in
the
past
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
life
of
the
beast
of
jungle
and
field
as
well
as
of
savage
and
barbarian
is
just
as
full
of
emergencies
and
shocks
as
that
of
the
average
city
man
or
woman
in
the
case
of
the
latter
however
inhibitions
education
and
the
conditions
of
modern
living
improper
food
sedentary
indoor
confinement
and
universal
rack
and
noise
have
undoubtedly
made
greater
and
greater
demands
upon
the
adrenal
glands
chemical
quantitative
studies
have
shown
that
by
repeated
stimulation
the
adrenal
glands
may
be
exhausted
of
their
reserve
supply
of
secretion
which
returns
only
insufficiently
if
not
enough
time
is
given
for
recuperation
there
results
a
condition
of
temporary
or
chronic
adrenal
insufficiency
supposedly
an
insufficient
functioning
of
the
gland
as
a
whole
in
persons
so
afflicted
there
appears
a
fatigability
a
sensitiveness
to
cold
cold
hands
and
feet
which
are
sometimes
mottled
a
loss
of
appetite
and
zest
in
life
and
a
mental
instability
characterized
by
an
indecision
and
a
tendency
to
worry
a
weepishness
upon
the
slightest
provocation
a
certain
number
of
the
temporary
breakdowns
or
nervous
prostrations
which
seem
to
be
growing
more
common
or
fashionable
may
be
sometimes
traced
to
such
a
deficiency
of
normal
response
to
the
needs
of
everyday
conflict
by
the
adrenal
gland
in
some
mental
and
physical
elasticity
are
totally
lost
and
even
the
slightest
exertion
in
either
field
often
causes
so
much
weariness
and
exhaustion
as
to
be
prohibited
depression
and
even
melancholia
are
associated
with
the
fear
of
not
being
able
to
accomplish
good
work
hitherto
easy
and
enjoyed
sometimes
they
are
obsessed
with
the
thought
that
they
have
lost
their
nerve
completely
and
so
dread
to
commit
themselves
in
even
the
most
trivial
of
situations
the
vacillating
frame
of
mind
is
so
distressing
at
times
as
to
arouse
thoughts
of
suicide
when
these
symptoms
concur
in
the
type
of
personality
whom
i
shall
describe
as
the
unstable
individual
there
is
evidence
for
explaining
the
process
as
the
effect
of
an
insufficiency
of
secretion
by
the
adrenal
gland
shock
collapse
heart
failure
and
sudden
death
following
abnormal
emotion
like
an
attack
of
rage
or
the
terrors
of
a
railroad
accident
or
bad
news
or
excessive
exertion
like
running
a
long
race
or
climbing
a
high
mountain
when
in
poor
general
health
as
the
phrase
goes
or
in
the
terminal
stages
of
infections
like
epidemic
influenza
or
asiatic
cholera
have
been
put
down
to
an
acute
insufficiency
of
the
adrenal
gland
a
lowered
temperature
blood
pressure
and
blood
vessel
tone
exhibited
in
tests
of
the
response
of
the
skin
to
stroking
are
present
in
all
of
these
and
point
the
same
moral
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
an
american
physician
beard
described
neurasthenia
a
general
disturbance
of
the
body
and
mind
not
properly
classifiable
as
a
disease
but
serious
enough
to
incapacitate
or
at
least
greatly
limit
the
sufferer
the
neurasthenic
is
to
be
recognized
by
the
fact
that
the
most
painstaking
objective
examination
of
his
organs
reveals
nothing
the
matter
with
them
yet
according
to
his
complaint
everything
is
the
matter
with
him
he
can
not
sleep
when
he
lies
down
he
can
not
keep
awake
when
he
stands
up
he
can
not
concentrate
but
still
he
is
pitifully
worried
about
his
life
the
slightest
irritant
causes
him
to
go
off
the
handle
as
he
works
himself
up
into
his
hysterical
state
as
a
reaction
to
a
disagreeable
person
or
problem
irregular
blotches
may
appear
on
his
face
and
neck
generally
his
hands
and
feet
are
clammy
and
perspiring
his
face
is
abnormally
flushed
or
pallid
the
eyes
are
worried
or
starey
unwonted
wandering
sensations
involving
now
this
area
of
the
body
or
now
that
obsess
him
as
the
blood
pressure
is
too
low
for
the
age
the
circulation
is
nearly
always
inadequate
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
is
a
frequent
complaint
so
frequent
that
attention
is
often
centered
upon
the
heart
a
diagnosis
of
heart
disease
is
made
and
the
unfortunate
is
doomed
for
life
to
brood
over
horrible
possibilities
the
brooding
over
themselves
and
their
troubles
is
one
of
the
distinctive
features
of
the
whole
complex
neurasthenia
may
masquerade
as
any
organic
disease
an
individual
with
a
soil
for
a
neurasthenic
reaction
to
life
will
become
neurasthenic
when
confronted
by
any
stone
wall
including
a
serious
ailment
within
himself
beard
neurasthenia
leaped
at
once
into
the
limelight
it
was
seized
upon
and
applauded
in
europe
as
a
good
new
name
for
an
old
condition
observed
particularly
in
americans
abroad
to
rest
from
the
fatigues
of
the
games
of
industrial
speculators
in
fact
the
name
of
the
american
disease
was
given
to
it
various
theories
about
the
effects
of
climate
sunlight

and
unit
of

oxygen
content
of
the

and
so
on
were
offered
up
upon
the
altar
of
scientific
explanation
sir
arbuthnot
lane
famous
protagonist
of
lane
intestinal
kink
said
that
all
americans
were
neurasthenic
neurasthenia
became
one
of
the
most
popular
of
diagnoses
and
remains
so
today
neurasthenia
regarded
as
a
reaction
of
people
to
the
stress
and
strain
of
life
has
without
a
doubt
increased
the
most
casual
of
observers
will
tell
you
that
the
generation
of
the
great
war
is
a
neurasthenic
generation
it
takes
its
pleasures
too
intensely
its
pains
too
seriously
its
troubles
too
flippantly
but
what
is
neurasthenia
beard
himself
regarded
it
as
a
chronic
fatigue
and
loss
of
tone
of
the
nervous
system
a
literal
interpretation
of
his
term
that
the
conception
as
far
as
it
goes
is
valid
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
is
the
neurasthenics
who
furnish
the
majority
of
the
clientele
of
the
cults
the
christian
scientists
the
osteopaths
and
the
chiropractors
and
who
are
the
subjects
of
the
faith
and
miracle
cures
like
those
of
lourdes
that
is
because
their
particular
disease
or
what
appears
to
them
to
be
their
very
own
disease
and
they
certainly
cherish
their
ailments
is
but
an
expression
of
a
compensation
for
indeed
a
consolation
for
the
underlying
feelings
of
insufficiency
or
inferiority
were
there
no
moral
code
were
there
no
social
system
nor
the
consequent
inculcated
conscience
to
be
responsible
to
there
would
be
no
such
disguising
symptom
as
the
disease
which
preoccupies
the
consciousness
the
feeling
of
insufficiency
would
be
there
and
would
be
recognized
as
in
itself
the
disease
to
the
physiologist
and
the
psychologist
the
feeling
of
insufficiency
is
the
disease
no
matter
how
spectacular
the
overlaying
phenomena
a
cripple
on
crutches
or
a
man
blind
and
speechless
shell
shock
is
now
acknowledged
to
belong
to
this
group
now
one
of
the
outstanding
effects
of
disease
of
the
adrenal
glands
is
the
feelings
of
muscular
and
mental
inefficiency
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
good
number
of
observations
conspire
for
the
idea
that
a
certain
number
of
neurasthenics
are
suffering
from
insufficiency
of
the
adrenal
gland
the
chronic
state
of
the
acute
phenomenon
known
as
the
nervous
breakdown
really
represents
in
them
a
breakdown
of
the
reserves
of
the
adrenals
and
an
elimination
of
their
factor
of
safety
in
the
light
of
that
conception
the
great
american
disease
dementia
americana
is
seen
to
be
adrenal
disease
and
the
american
life
to
be
the
adrenal
life
often
making
too
great
demands
upon
that
life
and
so
breaking
down
with
it
adrenal
excess
the
converse
of
adrenal
insufficiency
that
of
adrenal
excess
also
exists
in
certain
types
of
the
a
high
blood
pressure
accompanied
by
a
great
capacity
for
work
has
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
hypertrophy
of
the
cortex
in
women
there
is
a
degree
of
masculinity
as
the
adrenal
in
women
makes
for
masculinity
neutralising
more
or
less
the
specifically
feminine
influences
of
the
internal
secretions
of
the
ovary
such
women
possess
a
vigor
and
energy
above
the
normal
and
command
responsible
positions
in
society
not
only
among
their
own
sex
but
also
among
men
they
are
the
ones
who
in
the
present
overturn
of
the
traditional
sex
relationships
will
become
the
professional

the
gonads
puberty
or
interstitial
the
gonads
is
the
name
applied
to
the
generative
or
reproductive
glands
considered
collectively
in
the
male
they
are
the
testes
in
the
female
the
ovaries
they
are
therefore
sometimes
called
the
sexual
glands
as
they
possess
definite
canals
for
the
removal
of
their
gross
secretion
the
specific
reproductive
cells
ova
or
spermatozoa
to
a
surface
of
the
body
they
are
first
of
all
glands
of
external
secretion
but
they
have
been
also
found
to
hold
secretory
cells
not
concerned
with
the
making
of
the
reproductive
corpuscles
but
as
all
the
evidence
indicates
with
the
manufacture
of
an
internal
secretion
these
interstitial
cells
form
the
interstitial
gland
a
classic
example
of
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
lodged
in
the
interstices
of
a
gland
of
external
secretion
is
thus
furnished
by
the
gonads
origin
of
sex
traits
the
history
of
sex
goes
back
far
in
the
scheme
of
life
the
immortality
of
the
ameba
was
at
one
time
one
of
the
indisputables
of
biology
then
some
observations
were
made
which
threw
doubt
upon
a
long
accepted
fact
now
declared
a
dogma
lately
opinion
has
veered
back
to
immortality
but
in
the
case
of
a
close
relative
of
the
ameba
the
animal
known
as
the
paramecium
union
with
another
paramecium
true
conjugation
has
been
proved
necessary
to
prevent
death
sooner
or
later
sex
here
appears
in
its
most
primitive
form
on
the
basis
of
exchange
of
necessary
materials
between
individuals
to
prevent
death
their
own
having
been
so
to
speak
worn
out
in
the
course
of
metabolism
specifically
different
sexes
come
later
when
mortality
is
a
universal
fate
as
a
means
of
rebirth
and
escape
from
death
then
the
sexes
develop
their
latest
function
most
prominent
among
the
younger
vertebrates
of
acting
as
nature
most
potent
method
of
variation
and
differentiation
in
the
pursuit
of
the
different
nature
has
exalted
sex
and
the
intensity
of
the
sex
life
as
far
as
the
preservation
of
a
species
is
concerned
and
the
reproduction
of
the
individual
the
asexual
methods
budding
for
example
would
have
done
well
enough
but
when
it
comes
to
enacting
a
different
individual
apart
from
the
effects
of
environment
sex
stands
out
as
the
favored
method
of
life
the
development
of
the
sexes
and
the
sexual
life
brought
a
new
element
of
conflict
into
the
living
world
before
the
advent
of
the
sexes
the
conflict
was
essentially
for
the
means
of
existence
food
alone
but
with
the
sexual
life
came
a
conflict
for
sex
pleasure
a
competition
among
members
of
the
same
species
for
the
same
individual
as
their
sex
partners
the
result
was
the
introduction
of
a
factor
in
evolution
which
darwin
examined
so
closely
in
the
descent
of
man
the
sex
conflict
has
been
the
cause
for
the
origin
and
the
survival
of
certain
physical
and
mental
traits
helpful
in
sex
attraction
sex
combat
the
growth
of
the
embryo
and
the
nutrition
and
safety
of
the
young
of
a
species
in
short
the
whole
process
of
sexual
selection
the
proportions
of
the
skeleton
the
distribution
of
hair
and
fat
the
construction
of
organs
of
attack
and
defense
the
color
of
the
skin
the
cyclic
processes
of
preparation
for
impregnation
the
oestrus
or
heat
period
in
animals
the
menstrual
period
in
the
human
being
the
psychic
reactions
to
danger
and
combat
have
all
been
thus
determined
that
man
is
bearded
while
woman
is
not
that
woman
has
potentially
functional
breasts
while
man
has
not
the
aggressive
pugnacity
of
man
contrasted
with
the
more
passive
timidity
of
woman
have
all
been
evolved
in
the
sex
struggle
surviving
because
most
effective
in
that
struggle
these
secondary
sexual
characteristics
are
an
expression
of
the
influence
of
the
internal
secretion
of
the
gonads
or
the
interstitial
glands
some
call
them
puberty
glands
because
their
ripening
initiates
puberty
we
know
that
these
interstitial
glands
to
stick
to
that
name
rather
than
to
the
name
of
the
puberty
glands
since
they
serve
not
only
to
induce
puberty
but
to
maintain
maturity
are
the
actual
primary
dictators
of
the
process
by
which
male
and
female
are
distinguished
if
not
created
castration
was
probably
the
first
surgical
operation
carried
out
for
experimental
purposes
suggested
no

by
a
curiosity
concerning
its
effects
trepanning
of
the

the
geologic
record
indicates
was
done
even
by
the
cave

but
as
an
experimental
operation
castration
seems
to
hold
the
primary
position
in
the
annals
of
surgery
its
effects
noted
the
satisfaction
of
one
of
the
lower
human
instincts
jealousy

it
from

no
diminution
of
the
barbaric

by
which

are
prepared
for
the

it
is
to
the
credit
of
england
that
in
its
dominions
in
the
orient
the
practice
has
been
abolished
but
it
goes
on
even
today
according
to
the
best
authorities
four
out
of
five
of
these
victims
at
the
of
a
vicious
human
instinct
die
immediately
or
soon
after
from
exhaustion
due
to
pain
and
infection
not
all
of
the
ancient
nations
countenanced
the
brutal
horror
the
hebrews
placarded
castration
an
unpardonable
sin
making
it
a
sin
to
castrate
even
animals
nor
was
any
man
so
mutilated
permitted
to
worship
in
the
house
of
the
lord
deuteronomy
xxiii
yet
we
have
evidence
that
the
latter
jewish
kings
employed
foreign
eunuchs
in
their
harems
who
often
held
the
most
important
positions
as
ministers
of
the
court
besides
the
eunuchs
another
group
of
people
have
presented
material
for
the
study
of
the
interstitial
glands
these
are
the
skoptzi
of
russia
and
the
lipowaner
of
roumania
among
them
castration
is
a
religious
ritual
mankind
has
always
been
most
brutal
to
itself
in
the
name
of
the
ideal
these
sects
were
founded
because
in
the
eighteenth
century
an
antipode
of
joseph
smith
and
brigham
young
discovered
this
passage
in
matthew
xix
for
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
so
born
from
their
womb
and
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
men
and
there
be
eunuchs
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
he
that
is
able
to
receive
it
let
him
receive
it
he
decided
that
he
was
inspired
to
spread
the
gospel
of
castration
a
sect
was
founded
who
thought
that
surgery
was
the
easiest
way
to
enter
the
gates
of
paradise
and
they
multiplied
and
fructified
the
sect
exists
today
and
some
of
the
most
interesting
studies
of
the
internal
secretion
of
the
interstitial
glands
have
been
made
among
them
related
to
acquired
eunuchism
is
the
condition
of
eunuchoidism
the
eunuchs
which
were
so
born
from
their
mother
womb
baron
larey
the
great
surgeon
of
napoleon
armies
was
their
first
painter
he
was
the
only
altruist
bonaparte
said
he
had
ever
met
in
his
life
he
portrayed
a
group
of
soldiers
with
peculiarly
voices
smooth
and
hairless
skins
and
atrophied
generative
organs
a
somewhat
similar
picture
is
evolved
in
certain
types
of
insufficiency
of
the
pituitary
gland
features
of
the
picture
are
exhibited
with
disturbances
of
the
other
internal
secretory
glands
also
like
the
thymus
but
a
host
of
experiments
and
data
prove
the
interstitial
glands
to
be
the
direct
controllers
of
elementary
sexuality
and
the
specific
sex
traits
of
male
and
female
beginning
with
berthold
back
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
studied
the
fowl
a
number
of
observations
have
been
made
on
the
effects
of
excision
translocation
and
transplantation
of
these
glands
the
results
of
the
experiments
and
observations
can
be
summed
up
as
follows
if
the
male
individual
is
castrated
before
puberty
that
is
before
the
advent
of
the
sexual
life
secondary
sex
qualities
do
not
develop
in
males
the
generative
organs
do
not
grow
hair
on
the
face
does
not
appear
hair
elsewhere
on
the
body
remains
generally
scanty
the
voice
continues
as
as
the
child
there
is
more
or
less
muscle
weakness
obesity
and
mental
sluggishness
in
other
words
we
have
an
effeminate
man
technically
a
eunuch
in
the
castrated
female
the
pelvis
does
not
grow
to
the
normal
feminine
size
the
breasts
do
not
swell
as
they
should
more
or
less
hair
comes
out
on
the
face
the
voice
is
and
tends
to
be
rather
husky
the
legs
are
longer
and
again
the
mentality
is
dulled
that
is
a
masculine
sort
of
woman
is
produced
in
short
the
castrated
male
takes
on
a
feminine
type
and
the
castrated
female
a
male
type
in
either
case
there
is
also
an
infantilism
a
retention
of
the
infantile
mental
traits
a
lack
of
development
of
the
adult
mental
attitudes
and
reactions
now
if
in
the
castrated
male
is
transplanted
an
ovary
the
positive
characteristics
of
the
female
are
evoked
such
as
enlarged
mammary
glands
and
a
tendency
to
secretion
of
milk
experiments
have
also
been
reported
in
which
a
uterus
was
also
placed
in
such
an
animal
with
a
means
of
entry
and
pregnancy
followed
if
in
the
castrated
female
a
testicle
is
planted
the
masculine
traits
become
much
more
marked
and
striking
a
direct
exchange
of
the
male
and
female
rôles
can
thus
be
achieved
castration
after
puberty
can
not
modify
profoundly
structures
like
the
skeleton
which
are
already
completed
yet
it
may
unquestionably
bring
about
definite
retrogressive
changes
in
the
secondary
sex
characters
reduction
or
loss
of
virility
diminution
of
facial
and
body
hair
and
a
general
presenility
or
hastening
of
senility
how
remarkably
these
interstitial
cells
influence
the
entire
structure
and
vitality
of
the
organism
is
indicated
by
these
facts
how
much
they
have
to
do
with
sexual
impulses
sexual
excitement
and
sexual
desire
what
the
freudians
have
popularized
as
the
libido
and
how
subtly
they
act
upon
the
coming
and
duration
of
adolescence
and
maturity
as
well
as
sexual
precocity
and
peversions
we
shall
consider
in
a
later
chapter
but
it
is
enough
now
to
remember
that
these
interstitial
glands
are
the
primary
dictators
of
the
genital
sense
and
flair
of
the
individual
in
any
attempt
at
measurement
of
men
and
women
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
internal
secretion
of
the
interstitial
cells
must
be
respected
as
a
fundamental
consideration
the
womanly
woman
and
the
manly
man
those
ideals
of
the
victorians
which
crumbled
before
the
attack
of
the
ibsenites
strindbergians
and
shavians
in
the
nineties
but
which
must
be
recognized
as
quite
valid
biologically
are
the
masterpieces
of
these
interstitial
cells
when
in
their
perfection
they
are
such
solely
because
of
the
right
concentration
in
the
blood
of
the
substances
manufactured
not
only
by
these
cells
but
by
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
for
it
can
not
be
repeated
and
emphasized
too
often
that
the
interstitial
cells
of
the
sex
glands
are
most
sensitive
to
all
kinds
of
other
influences
and
in
particular
the
other
internal
secretory
organs
they
may
indeed
be
watched
as
an
index
scale
or
barometer
of
the
general
tone
of
the
whole
internal
secretion
system
sex

a
variety
of
clues
to
variations

and

in

the
components
of
the

take
a
single

of

with

have
longer

more

than
the

the

the

of
the

the

factor

used
successfully
some
of
the
glands
of
internal

act
as
accelerators
to
the
sex
glands
others
act
as
retarding
antagonists
among
the
most
important
of
the
latter
is
the
thymus
the
thymus
is
the
gland
which
dominates
childhood
it
appears
to
do
so
by
inhibiting
the
activity
of
the

or

castration
causes
a
persistent

and

of

some
to

there
seems
to

more
of

like

concerning

we
are
a
good
deal
at

the
latest
opinion
about
the
results
of
extirpation
even
in

is
that
they
are
nil
yet
there
is
a
certain
justification
for
proclaiming
the
thymus
the
gland
of
childhood
the
gland
which
keeps
children
childish
and
sometimes
makes
children
out
of
there
is
a
quantity
of
data
for
that
proposition
in
the
first
place
the
curve
of
rise
of
growth
of
the
gland
seems
to
coincide
with
the
period
of
childhood
the
curve
of
its
decline
with
the
period
of
adolescence
and
the
rise
of
the
sex
glands
in
the
past
it
was
accepted
that
with
puberty
the
thymus
atrophied
and
was
replaced
by
some
sort
of
fatty
tissue
nowadays
it
is

then
there
are
the
varied
and
remarkable
phenomena
of
thymus
enlargement
and
hyperactivity
in
childhood
itself
when
an
enlarged
thymus
is
present
in
an
infant
the
initiation
of
breathing
in
the
the
introduction
of
the
newcomer
to
the
oxygen
of
the
air
may
be
an
exceedingly
prolonged
difficult
matter
such
a
baby
is
said
to
be
born
blue
and
the
breathing
may
be
stridorous
for
days
becoming
normal
for
a
time
to
be
followed
later
by
spells
of
trouble
in
breathing
breathlessness
or
breathlessness
with
blueness
and
threatened
extinction
sometimes
these
spells
come
out
of
a
clear
sky
in
an
apparently
healthy
child
that
some
poison
probably
an
oversecretion
of
the
thymus
is
responsible
is
shown
by
the
relief
obtainable
by
shrinkage
of
the
gland
or
the
surgical
removal
of
a
part
of
it
moreover
the
gland
is
influenced
by
and
influences
the
factors
of
body
weight
and
growth
with
an
extreme
readiness
and
lability
deficient
general
undernutrition
leads
to
rapid
decline
in
its
weight
back
in
the
pioneer
student
of
the
thymus
friedleben
declared
that
the
size
and
condition
of
the
thymus
is
an
index
to
be
the
state
of
nutrition
of
the
body
underfeeding
for
four
weeks
will
reduce
it
to
one
thirtieth
the
normal
it
seems
to
act
as
a
storage
and
reserve
organ
affording
some
protection
against
the
limitation
of
growth
by
lack
of
food
material
in
exhausting
or
wasting
disease
the
weight
of
the
gland
sinks
much
more
quickly
than
other
glands
scattered
instances
have
been
reported
of
children
growing
putting
on
inches
in
height
and
expanding
mentally
when
thymus
was
fed
to
them
in
whom
every
other
measure
previously
tried
had
failed
a
french
study
of
over
four
hundred
idiotic
children
with
normal
thyroids
reported
that
over
three
fourths
had
no
thymus
at
all
everything
points
to
the
most
direct
and
close
relation
between
the
gland
and
nutrition
and
growth
but
with
nothing
tangibly
definite
like
our
knowledge
of
the
thyroid
and
the
pituitary
there
is
evidence
that
the
thymus
is
involved
in
the
health
and
efficiency
of
muscle
cells
and
muscularity
certain
tumors
of
the
thymus
presumably
destructive
of
the
gland
substance
proper
and
thus
cutting
off
its
secretion
are
accompanied
by
a
singular
muscle
weakness
and
atrophy
of
the
muscle
cells
entirely
out
of
proportion
to
the
general
damage
suffered
by
the
other
cells
of
the
body
when
affected
by
the
poison
of
a
malignant
growth
also
the
thymus
has
been
discovered
diseased
in
certain
mysterious
progressive
muscular
wastings
a
remarkable
fatigability
of
muscles
which
appears
after
the
slightest
exertion
is
a
feature
the
feeding
of
thymus
has
caused
muscle
cramps
which
apparently
depends
upon
an
increased
excitability
of
the
muscle
nerve
endings
feeding
of
thymus
to
some
of
the
lower
creatures
of
the
animal
kingdom
will
completely
hold
up
differentiation
take
the
unfolding
of
the
specialized
tissues
and
organs
which
transform
the
tadpole
into
the
frog
and
the
chrysalis
into
the
butterfly
a
tadpole
kept
supplied
with
enough
thymus
in
a
nutrient
medium
will
swell
into
an
extraordinary
giant
tadpole
but
will
not
change
into
a
frog
recently
this
experiment
has
been
contradicted
yet
this
effect
corresponds
to
the
conception
of
its
importance
in
childhood
as
a
retardant
of
precocity
physical
and
mental
clinical
observations
emphasize
that
in
childhood
it
is
the
chief
brake
upon
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
which
would
hasten
development
and
differentiation
checking
them
perhaps
for
a
given
time
and
so
profoundly
influencing
growth
the
pineal
the
pineal
is
another
gland
which
has
been
credited
with
similar
abilities
and
a
like
function
among
the
cells
like
the
thymus
it
has
been
supposed
one
of
the
distinctive
organs
of
childhood
and
to
die
with
it
generations
of
anatomists
solemnly
asserted
repeating
each
other
mistakes
with
the
aplomb
of
the
historians
who
declare
that
history
repeats
itself
that
the
pineal
body
was
a
useless
wastefully
space
consuming
vestige
of
a
once
important
structure
that
was
the
view
in
that
century
of
grandly
inaccurate
assertions
the
nineteenth
not
that
they
relegated
it
with
that
statement
to
the
limbo
of
the
dull
and
the
uninteresting
quite
the
contrary
they
conferred
upon
it
a
distinguished
romance
and
mystery
by
identifying
it
as
the
last
heir
and
vestigial
remnant
of
a
third
eye
situated
in
the
back
of
the
head
which
may
still
be
observed
in
certain
reptiles
imagine
it
somewhere
stuck
away
in
a
cranny
of
the
floor
of
your
head
and
mine
is
this
descendant
of
an
organ
that
once
sparkled
and
shone
wept
and
glared
took
in
the
stars
and
hawks
and
eagles
and
now
is
condemned
to
eternal
darkness
and
an
ineffectual
sandiness
today
we
have
not
discarded
that
view
of
its
history
but
we
know
a
little
more
regarding
its
composition
and
function
what
and
where
is
the
romantic
object
it
is
a
bit
of
tissue
hidden
away
at
the
base
of
the
brain
in
a
tiny
cave
behind
and
above
its
larger
colleague
the
pituitary
microscopic
scrutiny
reveals
that
it
is
made
up
in
part
of
nerve
cells
containing
a
pigment
similar
to
that
present
in
the
cells
of
the
retina
thus
clinching
the
argument
for
its
ancient
function
as
an
eye
but
the
outstanding
and
specifically
glandular
cells
are
large
secreting
affairs
which
too
reach
back
to
the
tidewater
days
of
our
vertebrate
ancestors
when
eurypterus
and
other
crustaceans
were
engrossed
with
the
fundamental
problems
of
brain
versus
belly
besides
these
there
are
the
singular
masses
upon
which
has
been
fastened
the
unnecessarily
opprobious
epithet
of
brain
sand
these
noted
and
commented
upon
from
the
earliest
times
consist
of
collections
of
crystals
of
lime
salts
sometimes
small
lying
about
in
discrete
irregular
masses
and
sometimes
grouped
into
larger
concretions
varying
much
in
size
these
brain
sand
particles
have
become
of
practical
importance
in
the
detection
of
pineal
disease
because
they
like
all
lime
salts
will
stop
the
and
so
can
be
photographed
for
a
long
time
indeed
up
to
scarcely
more
than
a
few
decades
or
so
ago
the
pineal
was
believed
to
have
no
present
function
at
all
or
at
least
no
ascertainable
or
accessible
duty
in
the
body
economy
that
it
might
perhaps
be
in
a
sense
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
was
a
despised
theory
then
a
classic
case
the
most
extraordinary
and
sort
of
case
with
symptoms
involving
the
pineal
gland
in
a
boy
was
reported
by
the
german
neurologist
von
hochwart
that
boy
provoked
a
little
army
of
researches
he
came
to
the
clinic
complaining
about
his
eyes
and
other
troubles
which
pointed
pretty
definitely
to
a
brain
tumor
as
the
diagnosis
to
him
nothing
extraordinary
about
him
in
that
respect
but
the
story
told
by
his
parents
was
quite
extraordinary
even
to
the
jaded
palate
of
the
clinic
professor
and
his
assistants
they
said
that
he
was
a
little
over
five
years
old
a
statement
conclusively
proved
correct
at
his
death
up
to
the
time
at
which
his
illness
began
he
had
been
quite
normal
in
size
intelligence
and
interests
but
with
the
onset
of
his
misfortune
he
had
begun
to
grow
and
rapidly
until
now
he
looked
and
corresponded
in
all
measurements
to
a
normal
boy
of
twelve
or
thirteen
hair
developed
all
over
his
skin
most
prominently
and
abundantly
in
the
typically
hairy
places
of
adults
his
voice
became
and
most
remarkable
of
all
his
sexuality
and
mentality
precocious
he
became
capable
of
true
sexual
life
and
is
said
to
have
asked
many
questions
about
the
fate
and
condition
of
the
soul
after
death
on
one
occasion
he
remarked
reflectively
it
is
odd
how
much
better
i
feel
when
i
let
other
children
play
with
my
toys
than
when
i
play
with
them
myself
other
statements
attributed
to
him
imply
the
most
astounding
maturity
of
thought
and
mental
process
headaches
finally
came
and
he
died
about
four
weeks
later
the
cause
of
the
whole
bizarre
tragedy
was
found
to
be
a
tumor
of
the
pineal
gland
as
has
happened
before
in
medical
history
no
sooner
was
the
one
prodigy
reported
than
a
score
of
others
of
the
same
ilk
sprang
into
the
limelight
cases
of
precocious
genital
development
especially
some
of
them
occurring
as
early
as
the
second
year
of
life
were
linked
with
them
it
is
an
interesting
point
to
be
noted
that
in
these
as
in
those
started
by
an
overaction
of
the
adrenal
cortex
it
is
premature
masculinity
that
is
stimulated
the
adrenal
cortex
must
be
classed
as
a
gland
of
masculinity
the
pineal
possibly
acts
as
a
brake
upon
the
adrenal
cortex
very
soon
after
the
report
of
von
hochwart
prodigy
appeared
an
experimental
research
on
the
pineal
was
begun
in
new
york
the
pineal
glands
of
a
number
of
young
bullocks
were
obtained
and
used
for
feeding
to
see
whether
an
overaction
of
the
internal
secretion
could
be
produced
guinea
pigs
kittens
and
rabbits
were
used
the
experiments
covered
about
two
years
in
time
of
a
dozen
small
kittens
the
subjects
outgrew
the
controls
rapidly
in
activity
size
intelligence
and
resistance
to
intercurrent
disease
of
ten
small
rabbits
the
controls
weighed
about
a
third
less
than
the
subjects
which
were
strikingly
clean
active
fat
and
salacious
feeding
of
the
gland
was
then
extended
to
a
particular
class
of
defective
children
children
with
heads
normal
eyes
symmetrically
functioning
limbs
excellent
digestion
strong
muscles
and
generally
normal
sometimes
rapid
growth
it
is
to
them
particularly
when
mental
normality
has
progressed
up
to
the
eighth
tenth
or
twelfth
year
and
stopped
that
the
term
moron
has
been
applied
they
have
been
a
hopeless
lot
belonging
to
the
limbo
of
the
incurables
moreover
they
emphatically
the
physically
normal
ones
differ
from
one
another
enormously
in
the
extent
to
which
mental
operations
are
possible
as
all
transitions
and
degrees
exist
no
definite
classification
and
subdivision
of
them
has
been
made
yet
ever
since
the
cretin
once
looked
upon
as
an
eternally
damned
defective
was
transformed
by
thyroid
feeding
into
an
apparently
normal
being
there
has
been
no
dearth
of
effort
to
find
the
right
kind
of
internal
secretion
to
fit
their
desperate
situations
but
in
vain
in
defectives
with
definitely
organically
damaged
brains
no
result
of
course
was
to
be
expected
in
those
of
any
class
over
fifteen
no
response
has
been
elicited
by
feeding
pineal
gland
in
the
others
the
results
have
been
contradictory
a
set
of
observations
have
related
the
pineal
to
muscle
function
inviting
comparison
of
it
with
the
thymus
there
is
a
singular
muscle
shrinking
and
deforming
disease
known
as
progressive
muscular
dystrophy
hitherto
a
complete
and
unsolved
mystery
newer
studies
of
the
pineal
in
this
disease
during
life
by
means
of
the
have
shown
it
calcified
that
is
buried
in
lime
salts
which
signifies
put
out
of
business
recently
thus
another
hint
as
to
its
function
has
been
ferreted
out
the
tadpole
as
a
reagent
to
test
out
the
growth
effects
of
different
glands
of
internal
secretion
has
also
been
employed
for
the
pineal
tadpoles
fed
on
pineal
present
a
marked
translucency
of
the
skin
due
to
a
retraction
of
the
skin
pigment
cells
now
without
a
doubt
a
number
of
as
yet
unknown
growth
and
metabolic
effects
follow
exposure
of
the
body
to
the
complete
gamut
of
light
rays
the
interesting
suggestion
follows
that
the
pineal
influences
the
body
by
varying
the
degree
of
light
ray
reaction
the
pineal
the
ghost
of
a
once
important
third
eye
at
the
back
of
our
heads
still
harks
back
in
its
function
to
a
regulation
of
our
susceptibility
to
light
and
its
effect
upon
sex
and
brain
so
it
becomes
one
of
the
significant
regulators
of
development
with
an
indirect
hastening
or
retardation
of
puberty
and
maturity
according
as
it
works
in
excess
or
too
indolently
it
appears
thus
the
blood
brother
of
the
adrenal
cortex
which
also
influences
the
skin
pigment
and
so
susceptibility
of
the
organism
to
light
brain
growth
and
sex
ripening
it
is
interesting
that
descartes
in
considered
the
pineal
the
seat
of
the
soul
the
parathyroids
sometimes
imbedded
within
the
substance
of
the
thyroid
in
the
neck
sometimes
placed
directly
behind
it
upon
the
windpipe
are
four
tiny
glands
each
about
the
size
of
a
wheat
seed
the
parathyroids
for
long
they
were
swamped
in
the
nearness
of
their
great
neighbor
and
considered
merely
a
variable
part
of
it
there
are
some
who
contend
that
even
today
but
it
has
been
proven
that
they
are
separate
individual
glands
with
a
structure
and
function
of
their
own
and
a
definite
importance
to
the
body
economy
on
the
animal
family
tree
they
appear
early
contemporaneously
with
the
thyroids
in
the
embryo
they
develop
from
about
the
same
sites
and
very
often
they
look
very
much
alike
under
the
microscope
especially
when
the
cells
are
in
certain
quiescent
stage
of
secretion
yet
they
are
wholly
independent
in
nature
activity
and
business
first
experimenters
upon
the
effects
of
removal
of
the
thyroid
were
confused
by
contradictory
findings
with
different
animals
because
in
some
they
would
take
out
the
parathyroids
at
the
same
time
without
knowing
it
and
in
others
they
would
not
that
possibility
suggested
more
careful
dissectors
accomplished
the
job
of
extirpating
the
thyroid
while
leaving
the
parathyroids
intact
and
vice
versa
in
consequence
some
definite
information
about
the
parathyroids
is
available
even
though
their
internal
secretion
has
never
been
isolated
or
its
existence
established
as
more
than
an
inference
when
the
parathyroids
are
removed
an
astounding
increase
in
the
excitability
of
the
nerves
follow
it
is
as
if
the
animal
were
thoroughly
poisoned
with
strychnine
the
slightest
stimulus
will
make
him
jump
or
throw
him
into
a
spasm
when
the
excitability
of
the
nerves
is
measured
by
an
electrical
instrument
it
is
found
augmented
by
from
five
hundred
to
one
thousand
per
cent
the
reflexes
those
automatic
responses
of
brain
and
spinal
cord
to
certain
stimuli
and
situations
become
enormously
sensitive
so
that
merely
letting
the
light
into
a
darkened
room
will
make
the
subject
of
the
experiment
go
into
a
series
of
convulsions
on
the
chemical
side
an
explanation
for
these
nervous
phenomena
has
been
advanced
lime
in
the
blood
and
cells
appears
to
be
necessary
in
a
number
of
ways
in
the
making
of
bone
and
teeth
in
the
coagulation
of
the
blood
in
the
keeping
of
fluid
within
the
blood
vessels
and
in
maintaining
the
tone
of
the
nerves
it
plays
a
major
rôle
now
the
parathyroids
among
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
seem
to
act
as
the
prime
regulators
of
the
amount
of
lime
held
within
the
blood
and
cells
for
when
the
parathyroids
have
been
completely
and
aseptically
excised
without
injuring
any
other
organ
immediately
the
body
begins
to
lose
lime
something
has
gone
out
of
it
that
helped
it
to
bind
lime
and
without
that
essential
something
the
internal
secretion
presumably
of
the
parathyroids
the
lime
departs
as
a
conspicuous
consequence
the
teeth
fail
to
develop
properly
particularly
as
to
their
enamel
for
which
lime
is
an
essential
constituent
hair
is
lost
there
is
a
general
wasting
the
nails
get
brittle
and
the
bones
soften
and
the
animal
dies
supplying
lime
directly
particularly
by
direct
injection
into

relieve
the
symptoms

often

to
sleep
or
sit
still
and
a
tremulous
handwriting
such
reports
round
out
the
evidence
for
the
importance
of
the
parathyroids
in
an
understanding
of
the
factors
which
control
growth
especially
as
regards
lime
utilization
for
without
lime
properly
handled
no
building
of
cells
is
possible
also
the
parathyroids
are
necessary
to
a
steadiness
of
muscle
and
nerve
the
pancreas
the
business
of
the
parathyroids
concerns
the
keeping
of
lime
in
the
body
another
gland
the
pancreas
or
sweetbreads
this
time
within
the
abdomen
a
close
neighbor
of
the
solar
plexus
alias
the
abdominal
brain
is
occupied
with
holding
and
hoarding
sugar
in
the
body
particularly
in
the
liver
the
great
sugar
warehouse
this
matter
of
retaining
sugar
and
controlling
its
output
is
one
of
the
utmost
significance
for
growth
and
metabolism
the
resistance
to
infections
the
response
to
emergency
situations
and
in
general
to
the
mobilization
of
energy
for
physical
and
mental
purposes
for
without
sugar
sufficiently
at
hand
for
the
cells
no
muscle
work
or
nerve
work
the
essentials
of
the
struggle
for
existence
are
possible
the
pancreas
is
an
organ
with
both
an
internal
and
external
secretion
the
external
secretion
long
known
evolved
by
the
major
portion
of
the
gland
is
poured
into
the
small
intestine
to
play
the
star
in
digestion
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
definitely
glandular
cell
groups
creating
the
external
secretion
are
smaller
collections
of
cells
called
the
islets
of
langerhans
which
have
been
demonstrated
to
elaborate
the
internal
secretion
there
are
about
a
million
of
these
islands
in
each
gland
the
hormone
has
been
called
insuline
unlike
most
of
the
glands
with
a
double
secretion
in
which
the
internal
is
absolutely
independent
and
so
to
speak
unconscious
of
the
external
these
two
of
the
pancreas
are
often
disturbed
together
perhaps
because
trouble
easily
hits
them
both
together
quite
the
most
disease
due
to
disturbed
internal
secretory
function
of
the
pancreas
is
diabetes
an
enormous
amount
of
work
has
been
spent
upon
the
various
aspects
of
it
as
a
mystery
hundreds
of
papers
in
a
dozen
languages
upon
the
subject
are
in
existence
in
a
nutshell
they
have
established
pretty
well
that
diabetes
is
a
disease
in
which
there
is
an
excess
of
sugar
in
the
blood
and
urine
because
of
an
insufficient
amount
of
the
secretion
of
the
islands
of
langerhans
in
the
pancreas
removal
of
the
pancreas
makes
the
body
essentially
the
liver
unable
to
retain
sugar
as
well
as
unable
to
burn
up
sugar
for
energy
the
situation
is
comparable
to
a
locomotive
with
its
coal
bins
leaking
and
the
coal
itself
acting
as
if
made
of
slate
or
some
equally
uncombustible
or
only
partially
combustible
material
the
control
of
sugar
mobilization
from
the
liver
where
it
is
stored
as
glycogen
or
animal
starch
is
divided
between
the
pancreas
and
the
adrenals
the
pancreas
acting
as
the
brake
the
adrenals
as
the
accelerator
of
the
mechanism
adrenal
and
pancreas
are
therefore
direct
antagonists
the
pans
of
the
scale
which
represents
sugar
equilibrium
in
the
organism
diabetes
may
be
regarded
as
a
disturbance
of
the
balance
assisted
by
events
which
produce
adrenal
overwork
like
great
or
prolonged
emotion
or
by
strain
of
the
pancreas
effected
by
for
example
there
are
other
minor
glands
of
internal
secretions
but
those
considered
are
by
far
the
most
important

chapter
iv
the
glands
as
an
interlocking
directorate
now
in
considering
each
gland
of
internal
secretion
as
a
separate
entity
and
labelling
it
with
certain
properties
and
actions
we
of
course
commit
the
usual
sin
of
the
intellect
the
sin
of
abstraction
and
isolation
of
its
material
this
crime
of
analysis
the
intellect
commits
every
day
in
the
search
for
truth
before
its
dissection
it
seems
to
have
to
dip
the
elusive
article
in
a
fixative
and
bottle
it
in
a
vacuum
yet
nothing
in
reality
is
more
of
a
changing
flux
than
the
body
in
all
of
its
parts
and
tissues
and
organs
and
of
all
these
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
stand
out
as
the
most
susceptible
to
change
made
to
react
to
stimuli
of
offense
and
defense
instantaneously
responsive
to
situations
involving
energy
exchanges
and
protective
reflexes
they
are
never
for
any
minute
the
same
or
alone
they
never
function
separately
each
influences
the
other
in
a
communicating
chain
let
one
be
disturbed
and
all
the
others
will
feel
the
impact
of
the
disturbance
and
vibrate
with
it
any
break
in
the
somatic
or
psychic
equilibrium
a
blow
or
an
infection
or
a
startling
thing
seen
or
a
worrisome
thought
felt
will
start
a
process
going
this
will
only
wind
up
when
every
gland
has
been
somehow
touched
and
a
final
equilibrium
reestablished
the
thyroid
maybe
was
first
excited
and
then
in
turn
the
adrenals
with
a
boomerang
reinforcing
effect
upon
the
thyroid
and
at
the
same
time
a
stimulating
effect
upon
the
pituitary
each
gland
is
thus
influenced
and
influencing
agent
and
reagent
in
the
complex
adjustments
of
the
organism
endocrine
the
is
a
perfect
corporation
not
quite
perfect
for
continually
there
arise
little
insurgencies
inadequacies
and
frictions
to
which
in
time
it
will
succumb
yet
in
the
efficiency
of
its
and
in
the
of
the
needs
and
supplies
of
producer
middle
man
and
consumer
there
is
no
one
of
the
great
organizations
of
the
captains
of
industry
which
can
for
a
moment
approach
it
of
this
corporation
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
are
the
directors
but
the
huge
corporation
not
to
topple
over
with
its
own
unwieldy
size
must
be
composed
of
smaller
units
each
within
itself
a
corporation
and
governed
by
a
directorate
there
are
in
the
different
departments
and
bureaus
subdivisions
of
function
which
constitute
the
smaller
corporations
within
the
larger
corporation
these
subsidiary
companies
have
their
own
glands
of
internal
secretion
as
their
directors
thus
the
growth
of
the
brain
is
presided
over
by
the
adrenal
cortex
the
thyroid
the
thymus
and
the
pituitary
they
determine
the
size
of
the
brain
the
number
of
its
cells
the
complexity
of
its
convolutions
and
the
speed
of
its
chemistry
which
means
the
speed
of
thought
and
memory
and
imagination
as
its
directorate
therefore
they
may
be
entitled
the
disturbance
of
one
of
them
means
the
disturbance
of
all
of
them
and
a
consequent
deleterious
effect
upon
the
brain
now
take
the
burning
up
of
sugar
in
the
organism
the
great
material
source
of
energy
which
is
controlled
by
the
pancreas
the
adrenals
and
the
liver
the
thyroid
and
the
pituitary
together
they
form
the
directorate
of
sugar
metabolism
but
as
is
evident
from
a
glance
at
the
membership
of
the
growth
directorate
and
comparing
it
with
the
directorate
of
sugar
metabolism
there
are
some
members
who
are
present
on
both
boards
an
infection
an
illness
an
ailment
an
exaltation
or
intoxication
of
such
members
will
produce
reverberations
in
both
directorates
a
disturbance
of
sugar
metabolism
might
then
cause
a
disturbance
of
growth
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
are
before
us
of
having
in
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
an
interlocking
directorate
rulers
over
all
the
varied
and
manifold
activities
of
the
organism
behind
the
body
and
behind
the
mind
is
this
board
of
governors
indeed
from
the
administrative
and
legislative
points
of
view
the
may
be
said
to
be
governed
by
the
house
of
glands
it
is
the
invisible
committee
behind
the
throne
upon
the
throne
is
what
man
the
most
baffling
of
complexities
man
who
is
not
a
mind
but
owns
a
mind
man
who
is
not
a
body
but
possesses
a
body
just
as
he
might
have
a
motor
car
a
fortune
or
a
calamity
back
of
all
his
daily
activities
behind
the
life
of
is
the
mysterious
unique
individuality
the
ego
the
psyche
or
the
soul
lately
a
competitor
with
these
ancient
and
honorable
terms
has
come
upon
the
scene
as
the
subconscious
in
that
darkened
no
man
land
is
determined
a
destiny
the
endocrine
association
stands
out
as
at
least
the
most
important
physical
determinant
of
the
states
and
processes
of
the
subconscious
antagonisms
and
as
within
a
corporation
there
are
factions
and
cliques
influences
that
always
work
together
and
forces
that
are
always
pulling
in
opposite
directions
so
within
the
interlocking
directorate
of
the
ductless
glands
there
are
antagonisms
and
inhibitions
and
compensations
one
gland
will
assist
the
action
of
secretion
with
its
own
or
will
in
turn
be
stimulated
to
secrete
by
it
another
will
throw
out
its
secretion
in
order
to
neutralize
the
effects
produced
or
its
own
activity
will
be
depressed
or
completely
inhibited
by
it
thus
the
pituitary
arouses
the
interstitial
glands
and
vice
versa
whereas
the
pancreas
and
the
thyroid
are
mutually
inhibitory
indeed
whole
systems
of
glands
may
work
in
unison
or
be
pitted
against
each
other
in
certain
situations
especially
when
the
organism
is
subjected
to
conflicting
impulses
with
the
clash
of
opposing
instincts
like
fear
and
anger
in
general
there
is
reciprocity
and
team
work
among
the
internal
secretions
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
each
must
be
present
if
life
is
to
continue
along
the
normal
lines
whether
there
is
to
be
an
excess
of
any
one
secretion
above
this
minimum
or
a
deficiency
below
it
decides
the
fate
of
the
individual
if
there
is
deficiency
of
one
the
other
members
of
the
directorate
attempt
to
make
up
for
what
has
been
lost
and
to
carry
on
its
work
by
an
extra
effort
to
substitute
or
released
from
the
discipline
of
the
deficient
member
or
the
necessity
for
antagonizing
it
they
may
be
released
from
its
stimulus
to
secrete
and
produce
less
of
their
own
specific
secretion
a
general
reaction
all
along
the
line
will
accompany
overaction
oversecretion
of
one
gland
due
to
consequent
stimulations
and
depressions
of
other
glands
some
may
be
excited
by
the
event
to
overwork
some
to
assist
others
to
act
as
antidote
for
the
excess
secretion
while
still
others
relieved
of
a
burden
do
not
have
to
supply
as
much
of
their
quota
under
the
circumstances
and
so
shut
down
or
limit
their
output
it
is
important
to
get
clearly
in
mind
these
subtle
of
the
different
ductless
glands
they
may
be
antagonistic
in
their
end
effects
because
of
the
opposed
functions
of
the
nerves
or
organs
stimulated
there
are
inhibitions
and
restraints
produced
when
a
gland
will
send
out
its
secretions
to
stop
another
gland
secreting
there
are
compensations
resulting
when
because
of
insufficiency
of
a
gland
others
will
endeavour
by
manufacturing
more
of
their
own
secretion
to
compensate
for
the
loss
there
are
mutual
partnerships
when
a
gland
will
oversecrete
to
assist
another
or
in
response
to
another
which
is
also
oversecreting
there
are
losses
of
balance
so
that
when
one
gland
ceases
secreting
another
will
simultaneously
or
soon
after
normal
secretion
oversecretion
or
undersecretion
are
thus
adjusted
but
leave
a
train
of
after
effects
so
with
loss
or
insufficiency
of
the
thyroid
there
may
be
pituitary
overgrowth
because
the
pituitary
may
act
as
vicar
for
the
thyroid
the
thyroid
and
thymus
are
antagonistic
for
the
thyroid
hastens
differentiation
puberty
and
the
coming
of
sexual
maturity
while
the
thymus
delays
and
retards
them
and
prolongs
the
period
of
childhood
the
thyroid
and
the
pancreas
are
antagonists
for
when
the
thyroid
has
been
excised
the
pancreas
appear
no
longer
necessary
to
act
as
a
break
upon
the
mechanism
of
sugar
liberation
into
the
blood
from
the
liver
the
thyroid
stimulates
the
interstitial
glands
for
menstruation
and
pregnancy
are
impossible
with
no
thyroid
or
an
insufficient
thyroid
removal
of
the
pituitary
makes
the
thymus
shrink
because
the
restraining
influence
of
the
latter
is
no
longer
needed
but
there
is
an
enlargement
of
the
thyroid
to
compensate
in
castrates
there
is
an
increase
in
the
size
and
number
of
the
cells
of
the
anterior
pituitary
again
a
compensation
or
substitution
effect
the
pituitary
and
the
adrenal
cortex
are
mutually
assistant
alike
in
their
influence
upon
the
tone
of
the
brain
and
sex
cells
the
kinetic
system
so
there
are
combinations
of
glands
to
assist
or
restrain
others
or
to
control
a
body
function
or
to
determine
the
domination
or
abeyance
of
an
instinct
one
such
has
been
named
the
kinetic
system
because
it
comes
into
play
in
situations
which
demand
prompt
adaptation
without
hesitancy
and
a
consequent
immediate
transformation
of
static
or
stored
energy
into
kinetic
or
active
energy
according
to
this
conception
the
brain
the
adrenals
the
liver
the
thyroid
and
the
muscles
together
constitute
a
machine
very
much
like
an
automobile
the
of
the
machine
is
the
brain
with
storage
battery
composed
of
stored
past
memories
and
ignition
combined
the
thing
seen
without
or
the
idea
felt
within
act
as
the
initial
sparks
while
the
adrenals
as
the
carburetors
permit
the
freer
flow
of
fuel
sugar
from
the
liver
the
thyroid
works
as
the
accelerator
the
original
impulse
finally
landing
upon
muscles
keyed
up
and
supplied
with
food
to
meet
the
situation
be
it
that
of
removing
a
poison
removing
an
aggressor
attack
or
removing
the
individual
himself
running
away
when
one
is
exhausted
by
exertion
and
emotion
injury
intoxication
or
infection
it
is
these
members
of
the
kinetic
system
the
brain
the
adrenals
thyroid
and
liver
which
are
exhausted
exhaustion
diminishes
when
the
activity
of
the
brain
is
diminished
by
anesthetics
and
cured
when
it
is
abolished
by
sleep
if
the
adrenal
gland
may
be
called
the
gland
of
emergency
energy
the
kinetic
system
is
entitled
to
the
name
of
council
of
emergency
defense
for
the
organism
the
kinetic
drive
is
the
name
that
has
been
given
to
the
whole
system
at
work
it
is
one
of
the
best
examples
we
have
of
and
reactions
in
reply
to
the
threat
of
danger
or
the
hint
of
pleasure
the
check
and
drive
system
another
instance
of
the
complexity
of
these
reactions
is
furnished
by
the
thyroid
and
the
adrenals
the
thyroid
and
the
adrenals
are
mutually
stimulating
when
the
thyroid
oversecretes
the
adrenal
dittos
and
vice
versa
yet
they
have
directly
opposed
effects
upon
the
economy
because
they
act
upon
antagonistic
portions
of
the
involuntary
or
vegetative
nervous
system
the
system
which
is
independent
of
the
will
before
proceeding
further
it
is
worth
while
sketching
this
division
of
the
nervous
system
in
the
construction
of
a
motor
car
from
the
point
of
view
of
absolute
control
of
it
at
every
moment
the
first
thought
of
the
mechanic
is
an
adequate
and
an
efficient
of
speed
instruments
antagonistic
but
necessary
to
work
simultaneously
or
alternately
the
involuntary
or
vegetative
nervous
system
is
built
upon
the
same
principle
it
supplies
every
organ
in
the
body
beyond
the
control
of
the
will
that
is
to
say
the
brain
with
two
sets
of
filaments
which
have
opposing
functions
one
group
of
filaments
in
general
increases
or
activates
the
function
of
the
organ
to
which
it
is
distributed
the
other
group
of
filaments
when
tingling
inhibits
or
prohibits
that
function
they
are
like
the
two
buttons
on
the
wall
which
regulate
the
supply
of
electricity
to
incandescent
bulbs
one
switching
on
the
current
the
other
switching
it
off
it
has
been
agreed
to
call
the
stimulative
or
activating
portion
the
autonomic
or
drive
system
to
its
antagonist
has
been
left
the
older
name
of
the
sympathetic
or
check
system
it
is
because
they
do
not
both
act
upon
these
two
components
of
the
vegetative
nervous
system
but
only
upon
one
that
the
thyroid
and
adrenal
though
in
themselves
complementary
come
to
exert
opposite
effects
for
the
internal
secretion
of
the
thyroid
has
a
selective
affinity
for
the
autonomic
or
activating
system
while
that
of
the
adrenals
has
a
selective
affinity
for
the
sympathetic
or
inhibiting
system
in
the
stomach
for
instance
extracts
of
the
adrenal
glands
have
been
proved
to
intensify
the
function
of
the
sympathetic
or
check
system
in
different
degrees
so
that
there
is
a
lessening
of
the
amount
and
acidity
of
the
gastric
fluid
on
the
other
hand
thyroid
extracts
will
intensify
the
action
of
the
autonomic
or
drive
system
so
that
the
amount
and
acidity
of
the
digestive
juice
is
increased
the
stomach
cell
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
a
for
the
different
internal
secretions
as
they
affect
the
check
and
drive
systems
these
constitute
an
automatic
device
for
regulating
the
activities
of
every
organ
three
factors
enter
into
the
mechanism
one
is
the
amount
of
the
circulating
internal
secretions
another
is
the
organic
and
functional
integrity
of
the
nerve
filaments
comprising
the
check
and
drive
systems
the
third
consists
of
the
number
and
vitality
and
limitations
of
the
terminal
receiving
cells
acted
upon
by
the
nerve
filaments
which
in
their
turn
have
been
acted
upon
by
the
internal
secretions
upon
every
organ
including
the
mind
through
the
brain
a
stimulus
from
without
or
within
will
act
according
to
its
ability
to
influence
one
or
others
of
these
factors
normally
the
check
and
drive
systems
are
properly
balanced
but
under
stress
and
strain
the
balance
is
upset
indeed
the
kinetic
drive
may
be
defined
as
a
mechanism
contrived
in
the
course
of
evolution
as
the
normal
healthy
mode
for
meeting
stress
and
strain
the
kinetic
chain
of
organs
brain
adrenals
liver
thyroid
and
muscles
began
working
together
in
desperate
situations
for
their
possessor
ages
ago
successful
in
helping
him
to
survive
they
have
survived
as
a
functional
unit
it
was
probably
evolved
in
the
era
about
twenty
million
years
ago
when
the
coming
of
the
carnivores
introduced
direct
conflicts
and
their
concomitants
a
quick
and
versatile
nervous
system
during
the
tertiary
epoch
the
earth
basked
in
the
heat
of
a
tropical
sun
nearly
everywhere
on
its
surface
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
torrid
zone
flourished
and
swarmed
for
the
temperature
all
over
was
what
it
is
today
at
the
equator
gigantic
vegetarians
were
the
animals
creatures
like
the
dinosaurs
enormous
gargoylean
monsters
of
an
incredible
size
and
strength
but
clumsy
and
grotesque
with
small
brains
and
little
intelligence
for
what
need
was
there
for
brain
and
intelligence
when
food
lay
about
so
abundantly
at
hand
for
them
to
gorge
themselves
as
there
was
no
competition
for
food
there
were
no
enemies
then
as
the
earth
evolved
and
grew
cooler
vegetation
failed
the
ancestors
of
the
present
carnivora
appeared
the
fathers
of
the
wolf
and
tiger
light
lithe
and
pugnacious
with
senses
acute
and
ferocious
weapons
of
attack
who
set
out
to
destroy
everybody
they
destroyed
pretty
nearly
all
of
the
huge
species
and
only
the
more
plastic
and
smaller
ones
who
were
more
and
of
whom
the
deer
and
antelope
horse
and
ox
are
the
descendants
escaped
the
smallest
either
took
to
the
air
to
become
the
bat
or
like
the
forerunners
of
the
squirrel
and
ape
took
to
the
trees
it
was
the
coming
of
the
carnivores
therefore
that
accelerated
the
development
of
brain
matter
and
started
the
process
which
created
man
but
in
the
millions
and
millions
of
years
of
conflicts
instincts
grew
into
being
that
sank
deep
into
bone
and
marrow
the
most
fundamental
reflexes
those
immediate
responses
to
irritation
or
danger
were
laid
down
and
among
them
the
drive
and
check
system
when
the
animal
had
decided
to
fight
its
enemy
or
was
forced
to
fight
or
determined
to
prey
then
was
the
time
for
the
drive
system
to
do
its
utmost
to
speed
up
everything
that
would
help
in
the
fight
while
the
check
system
came
into
play
to
hinder
whatever
would
interfere
or
burden
in
the
fray
first
the
drive
mechanism
must
have
been
hit
upon
and
then
the
value
of
the
check
devices
must
have
been
found
in
fear
and
flight
and
especially
in
hiding
and
simulation
of
death
when
even
breathing
had
to
be
inhibited
until
finally
there
developed
for
everyday
use
a
complete
check
and
drive
nerve
machinery
for
every
organ
to
be
used
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
with
the
thyroid
as
the
primary
stimulant
and
controller
of
the
drive
system
and
the
adrenal
as
the
primary
dictator
over
the
check
system
the
harmony
of
the
hormones
all
the
glands
in
fact
work
in
unison
with
a
distribution
of
the
balance
of
power
that
diplomatists
might
envy
in
the
synchronism
the
vegetative
nervous
system
plays
the
part
of
an
agent
that
acts
as
well
as
is
acted
upon
the
chemical
interaction
of
the
internal
secretions
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
they
influence
each
other
for
as
the
case
of
the
thyroid
and
the
adrenal
so
well
shows
secretions
which
when
directly
interacting
are
mutually
reinforcing
when
affecting
nerves
may
become
clashing
opponents
the
kinetic
chain
is
about
as
good
a
case
as
there
is
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
the
check
and
drive
systems
with
the
adrenals
and
thyroid
opposed
are
one
of
the
best
instances
of
their
antagonisms
besides
there
are
a
number
of
other
relationships
between
them
that
might
be
cited
they
all
bear
with
more
or
less
pressure
positive
or
negative
upon
the
sex
glands
which
will
be
considered
in
its
place
if
one
wished
to
consider
all
the
glands
in
their
pro
and
anti
relations
a
separate
volume
would
be
required
the
vegetative
apparatus
the
combination
of
the
internal
secretions
and
the
vegetative
system
has
been
spoken
of
as
the
vegetative
or
autonomic
apparatus
the
vegetative
apparatus
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
nervous
system
and
some
acquaintance
with
its
constitution
is
necessary
to
any
understanding
of
the
possibilities
of
control
of
human
nature
for
modern
thought
does
not
regard
the
brain
as
the
organ
of
mind
at
all
but
as
one
unit
of
a
complex
synthesis
of
which
mind
is
the
product
and
the
vegetative
apparatus
is
the
major
component
that
involves
the
blasting
of
the
last
current
superstition
of
the
traditional
psychology
the
dogma
that
the
brain
is
the
exclusive
seat
of
mind
that
an
animal
is
a
vast
concourse
of
cells
is
one
of
the
accepted
fundamentals
of
biology
what
is
not
so
generally
taken
into
consideration
is
that
the
assemblage
is
formed
by
the
agglutinations
of
millions
of
years
and
that
it
is
hence
composed
of
parts
of
different
ages
and
pedigrees
some
exceedingly
ancient
and
hoary
some
and
some
relatively
new
and
recent
in
the
invertebrates
who
date
further
back
in
the
history
of
the
planet
than
any
vertebrate
the
nervous
system
consists
of
discrete
patches
of
nerve
cells
the
ganglions
composing
the
ganglionic
system
of
which
the
vegetative
or
autonomic
nervous
system
of
man
is
the
direct
descendant
and
representative
the
brain
and
central
nervous
system
are
definitely
later
acquisitions
imposed
upon
the
original
stratum
of
the
check
and
drive
machine
the
primitive
chassis
of
the
mechanism
so
to
speak
is
the
vegetative
nervous
system
grouped
with
that
system
are
the
primeval
breathing
feeding
and
reproducing
inventions
the
viscera
boxed
up
in
the
chest
and
abdomen
the
third
partner
is
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
which
act
upon
the
viscera
both
directly
and
indirectly
through
the
check
and
drive
effect
upon
the
vegetative
nerves
the
glands
are
like
tuning
keys
by
which
certain
strings
in
the
instrument
may
be
tightened
so
that
its
vibratory
activity
is
increased
or
they
may
be
loosened
the
vibrations
decreased
the
activity
lessened
tuning
up
the
motors
is
a
constant
process
in
the
organism
finally
there
are
the
large
nerve
masses
at
the
base
of
the
brain
known
as
the
basal
ganglia
which
contain
the
nerve
centers
for
the
of
the
other
three
all
these
together
constitute
the
oldest
family
of
the
corporate
organism
beside
them
the
brain
and
the
face
and
the
prehensile
organs
are
mere
parvenus
the
oldest
part
of
the
mind
granted
then
that
this
vegetative
apparatus
is
the
most
deeply
rooted
core
of
our
being
what
warrant
is
there
for
the
grandiloquence
of
the
phrase
the
oldest
part
of
the
mind
there
is
indeed
room
for
rhetoric
even
poetry
here
for
all
the
evidence
points
to
it
as
the
rightful
occupant
of
the
throne
upon
which
shelley
placed
his
brownie
as
the
soul
of
the
soul
or
to
put
it
in
another
way
we
think
and
feel
primarily
with
the
vegetative
apparatus
with
our
muscles
especially
the
involuntary
with
our
viscera
and
particularly
with
our
internal
secretions
whenever
there
is
thought
and
feeling
there
is
movement
commotion
precedent
and
concomitant
among
these
they
are
the
oldest
seats
of
feeling
thought
and
will
and
continue
to
function
as
such
just
what
evidence
is
there
for
this
conception
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
fascinating
story
of
the
origin
of
vertebrates
from
invertebrates
of
the
sea
scorpion
or
spider
type
then
there
is
a
whole
group
of
data
which
demonstrate
that
the
primitive
wishes
which
make
up
the
content
of
a
baby
consciousness
are
determined
settled
by
states
of
relaxation
or
tension
in
different
segments
or
areas
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
according
to
this
the
brain
enters
as
only
one
of
the
characters
in
the
play
of
consciousness
it
is
just
the
organ
of
awareness
by
the
organism
of
itself
as
an
integer
which
must
adjust
itself
to
the
specific
condition
within
the
disturbed
vegetative
apparatus
consequently
the
brain
emerges
not
as
the
master
tissue
but
as
merely
the
servant
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
consciousness
is
a
circuit
swinging
around
in
it
are
the
generated
by
the
vegetative
dynamo
from
each
viscus
from
the
stomach
and
intestine
from
the
kidneys
and
bladder
from
the
liver
and
spleen
from
the
from
all
the
glands
of
external
and
internal
secretion
there
flow
along
the
vegetative
nerves
to
and
from
the
brain
energies
of
various
qualities
and
intensities
all
the
members
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
are
more
or
less
active
and
so
all
our
wishes
are
all
more
or
less
active
all
our
working
hours
we
are
aware
of
hunger
satiety
or
indifference
of
a
desire
to
empty
the
intestine
or
bladder
or
of
a
lack
of
necessity
of
doing
so
of
a
state
of
tranquillity
of
the
and
sweat
glands
or
of
a
perturbation
of
them
of
a
varying
tensity
of
even
the
muscles
that
are
as
we
say
under
the
control
of
the
will
of
the
state
in
fact
of
all
the
elements
of
the
vegetative
complex
the
stream
of
feeling
which
constitutes
the
undertow
of
consciousness
originates
outside
of
the
brain
altogether
and
is
composed
of
currents
arising
from
viscera
muscles
and
glands
now
the
component
currents
are
of
different
sizes
and
positions
and
variable
degrees
of
warmth
that
is
another
way
of
saying
that
whether
or
not
a
current
is
to
become
the
center
of
the
stream
or
to
approach
it
or
whether
it
is
to
be
hot
cold
or
tepid
depends
upon
the
degree
of
activity
of
the
various
parts
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
a
convenient
name
for
this
is
tonus
can
be
experimentally
watched
and
measured
thus
hunger
the
most
primitive
of
the
has
been
found
to
be
simultaneous
with
certain
characteristic
contractions
of
the
stomach
stop
those
contractions
and
you
stop
the
hunger
the
contractions
begin
slowly
and
weakly
and
no
awareness
of
them
occurs
in
the
mind
as
they
grow
stronger
consciousness
becomes
a
sensation
rather
like
an
itch
somewhere
in
the
upper
abdomen
and
accompanied
sometimes
by
a
sense
of
general
weakness
the
vegetative
activity
going
on
as
a
current
almost
on
the
outside
of
the
stream
of
feeling
has
swelled
and
warmed
and
so
forced
itself
in
a
manner
of
speaking
into
the
center
of
the
stream
or
if
you
will
the
rest
of
the
stream
has
to
arrange
itself
around
it
as
the
center
a
similar
mechanism
for
the
tonus
of
the
other
members
of
the
vegetative
system
and
how
they
determine
consciousness
and
behaviour
is
understandable
it
has
been
shown
that
when
the
bladder
tone
and
the
intestinal
tone
are
of
a
definitely
measurable
size
one
has
the
desire
to
empty
them
the
same
applies
to
the
sex
glands
the
pressure
within
a
viscus
is
dependent
upon
the
ratio
between
the
amount
of
contraction
of
the
involuntary
muscle
in
its
walls
the
external
pressure
and
the
quantity
of
its
distending
contents
the
internal
pressure
the
resultant
quotient
the
internal
pressure
divided
by
the
external
pressure
measures
the
intravisceral
pressure
the
primitive
are
the
direct
expressions
of
the
various
intravisceral
pressures
or
tones
the
primitive
soul
is
an
awareness
of
the
fused
primitive
of
themselves
as
a
whole
and
of
the
struggle
between
them
for
recognition
isolation
and
as
we
say
satisfaction
this
satisfaction
consists
in
a
degradation
of
the
highest
intravisceral
pressure
to
a
point
at
which
some
other
intravisceral
pressure
becomes
higher
and
therefore
predominant
physics
of
the
wish
mind
consciousness
may
then
be
portrayed
as
an
ocean
comprised
of
mobile
current
layers
complexes
built
up
around
the
awareness
of
different
intravisceral
pressures
a
shifting
hierarchy
of
such
pressures
form
the
points
of
focusing
of
consciousness
that
result
in
conduct
behaviour
may
be
defined
as
the
resultant
of
the
pressure
against
the
environment
counter
pressure
until
there
is
a
sufficient
reduction
of
the
specifically
exciting
intravisceral
pressure
just
as
water
flows
to
its
own
level
so
will
conduct
flow
to
reduce
intravisceral
pressure
to
its
own
level
a
physics
of
the
soul
comes
into
prospect
in
which
a
mathematical
analysis
will
state
the
process
quantitatively
in
terms
of
some
common
unit
of
pressure
not
only
conduct
but
also
character
because
it
is
past
conduct
repeated
associated
and
fixed
will
be
so
statable
for
intravisceral
tonus
or
pressure
is
not
simply
or
only
an
acute
or
passing
affair
there
is
for
it
a
persistent
or
average
figure
the
normal
for
it
below
which
or
above
which
the
acute
situation
will
bring
it
is
a
then
of
standards
in
the
vegetative
character
indeed
is
an
alloy
of
the
different
standard
intravisceral
pressures
of
the
organism
a
fusion
created
by
the
resistance
or
counter
pressure
of
the
obstacles
in
the
environment
character
in
short
is
the
grand
intravisceral
barometer
of
a
personality
thus
the
comfortable
healthy
happy
progressive
constructive
virile
personality
is
one
in
whom
there
is
a
continuously
harmonious
reduction
of
the
intravisceral

a
gregarious

the
most
powerful
determinants
of

not
so
well
rounded

other
types
existing
because
of
inferiorities
or
excesses
of
the
standard
visceral

there
is
for
instance
the
sexually
cold
type
comfortable
by
creating
for
itself
an
anaphrodisiac
environment
composed
of
pressures
that
can
be
fitted
into
its

there
may
be
an
insufficiency
of

be

the
permutations

internal

the

by

the

conferred
upon

carlson
the
chicago
physiologist
who
probably
knows
more
about
being
hungry
than
any
other
man
on
the
planet
once
demonstrated
that
the
injection
of
an
ounce
or
two
of
the
blood
which
means
the
internal
secretion
mixture
of
a
starving
animal
into
one
not
starving
increased
the
signs
of
hunger
and
the
accompanying
hunger
contractions
of
the
stomach
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
hunger
is
the
expression
of
a
certain
specific
concentration
of
internal
secretion
or
secretions
in
the
blood
when
the
quantity
in
the
cycles
of
metabolism
becomes
sufficiently
great
it
stimulates
the
stomach
to
contract
in
a
way
which
augments
the
pressure
within
it
to
a
point
at
which
the
feeling
of
hungriness
and
the
wish
to
satisfy
it
or
to
get
rid
of
it
becomes
imperative
and
the
dominant
of
consciousness
without
doubt
the
sexual
cravings
are
likewise
so
determined
sex
libido
is
an
expression
of
a
certain
concentration
a
definite
amount
peculiar
to
the
individual
of
the
substance
manufactured
by
the
interstitial
cells
circulating
in
the
blood
it
arouses
its
effects
probably
by
increasing
the
amount
of
reproductive
material
in
the
sex
glands
in
a
direct
chemically
stimulating
effect
upon
the
germinative
cells
and
so
raising
the
internal
pressure
within
them
stimulating
the
involuntary
muscles
within
the
walls
and
the
canals
of
the
sex
glands
and
so
by
augmenting
the
tenseness
of
the
muscles
elevating
the
total
intravisceral
pressure
by
a
direct
chemical
and
indirect
nervous
effect
upon
the
brain
the
muscles
the
heart
as
well
as
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
stimulating
the
organism
as
a
whole
though
the
isolation
in
pure
form
of
the
substance
or
substances
involved
has
never
been
scientifically
achieved
their
inference
is
entirely
justified
it
is
indeed
the
only
comprehensible
mechanism
conceivable
that
will
fit
all
the
known
facts
about
the
matter
and
even
though
the
assertions
of
were
only
the
exaggerations
of
a
it
is
certain
that
some
day
in
the
near
future
the
particular
substance
that
he
claimed
he
had
discovered
will
be
handed
about
in
bottles
for
the
inspection
of
the
curious
besides
thyroxin
adrenalin
and
the
secretion
of
the
interstitial
cells
the
substance
produced
by
the
paired
glandlets
situated
behind
the
thyroid
the
parathyroids
have
a
profound
influence
upon
the
vegetative
apparatus
and
the
vegetative
nervous
system
these
direct
the
lime
exchanges
within
the
cells
of
the
organisms
including
the
nerve
cells
it
has
been
shown
that
lime
is
relatively
a
sedative
to
cells
it
raises
the
threshold
or
strength
of
stimulus
necessary
to
evoke
a
reaction
removing
the
parathyroids
means
removing
the
lime
barrier
for
with
their
deficiency
there
is
a
change
in
and
then
an
escape
from
the
blood
of
the
lime
by
way
of
the
kidneys
the
result
is
sometimes
an
enormous
increase
in
the
excitability
of
all
the
cells
and
especially
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
what
that
means
for
the
individual
whose
comfort
depends
upon
a
stability
of
the
intravisceral
tones
and
pressures
may
be
readily
imagined
the
pancreas
likewise
acts
as
a
sedative
to
the
vegetative
apparatus
in
particular
this
applies
to
the
sugar
mechanism
in
the
liver
under
the
discipline
of
the
check
and
drive
organization
the
adrenal
and
the
pancreas
are
the
direct
antagonists
in
the
struggle
for
control
of
sugar
removal
of
the
adrenals
will
cause
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
sugar
in
the
blood
while
removal
of
the
pancreas
will
produce
an
increase
excess
of
sugar
in
the
blood
may
thus
be
concomitant
with
changes
of
character
considered
incorrigible
in
different
locales
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
as
indeed
of
the
body
in
general
the
directorate
seems
to
be
handed
over
to
a
committee
of
control
generally
made
up
of
two
members
working
in
opposing
directions
such
a
division
of
power
in
the
general
directorate
is
analogous
to
the
small
holding
corporations
which
divide
functions
in
for
example
the
united
states
steel
corporation
the
relative
ratios
of
tonus
in
these
smaller
internal
secretion
balances
are
of
the
utmost
significance
as
causes
of
differences
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
which
are
the
basis
of
differences
in

and

between

the
general

of

our
knowledge
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretions
as
an
interlocking
directorate
presiding
over
all
the
functions
of
the
organism
is
still
exceedingly
meagre
as
yet
we
seem
to
be
knocking
at
the
portals
of
the
chemistry
of
the
imponderable
there
are
holes
in
the
bronze
doors
and
we
glimpse
the
unfathomable
distances
of
unexplored
regions
but
we
do
see
something
and
we
do
glimpse
a
beginning
already
the
outlines
of
a
differential
anatomy
and
a
different
physiology
and
a
differential
psychology
which
will
explain
to
us
the

worth

before

so
valuable
to
a

which
would
become
rational
to
summarize
the
general
principles
emerging
expressing
the

of
the

over

may
be
regarded
as
the

the

of

depends
to
a
large
extent
upon

and
with

several
of

a

superior

that
of
the
others
in

of
the

so

all

be
directly
associated
with

that

have

indeed

the

of

the

thus
explained
internal

are

variations
in

are
essentially
the

exerted
by

if
they

they
may
reinforce

will
come
into

apply

of

as
the

upon
these

comprehensible

a

as

be

let
us
now
see
how
chapter
v
how
the
glands
influence
the
normal
body
the
origin
of
the
remarkable
differences
between
individuals
that
distinguish
species
varieties
and
families
has
long
been
one
of
the
chief
puzzles
of
biology
it
may
indeed
be
called
the
leading
puzzle
which
led
darwin
on
to
the
collection
of
the
data
that
culminated
in
the
origin
of
species
the
why
of
the
unique
is
the
fundamental
problem
of
those
who
would
understand
life
an
explanation
is
an
attempt
at
a
consistent
and
persistent
sometimes
an
obstinate
clarity
of
mind
a
vast
number
of
observations
gathered
by
laboratory
experimentalists
as
well
as
by
those
naturalists
of
the
abnormal
physicians
in
active
practice
prove
that
the
construction
of
the
individual
both
during
development
before
maturity
and
maintenance
during
maturity
his
constitution
in
short
is
directed
by
the
endocrine
glands
it
is
possible
now
to
present
an
explanation
of
the
individuality
of
the
individual
to
assert
that
variation
is
responsible
for
the
individual
that
it
is
the
mechanism
which
isolates
him
as
a
being
like
none
other
of
his
fellows
not
even
his
parents
brothers
and
sisters
is
merely
to
beg
the
question
what
is
variation
the
internal
secretion
theory
of
the
process
offers
for
the
first
time
an
explanation
that
is
coherent
and
comprehensive
based
upon
concrete
and
detailed
observations
it
provides
an
adequate
interpretation
of
the
numberless
hereditary
gradations
and
transitions
blendings
and
mixtures
it
suggests
a
control
of
heredity
in
the
future
the
pure
types
in
the
pure
types
only
one
gland
either
by
being
present
in
great
excess
above
the
average
or
by
being
pretty
well
below
the
average
comes
to
exercise
the
dominating
influence
upon
the
traits
of
the
organism
as
the
strongest
link
in
the
chain
or
as
the
weakest
it
rules
the
others
must
accommodate
themselves
to
it
among
them
as
commanders
of
growth
development
and
normal
function
it
holds
the
balance
of
power
in
every
emergency
it
stands
out
by
its
strength
or
by
its
weakness
it
thus
creates
its
own
type
of
man
or
woman
with
attributes
and
characteristics
peculiar
to
itself
these
pure
types
as
we
have
seen
are
mainly
the
thyroid
the
pituitary
and
the
each
with
the
signs
peculiar
to
it
can
be
identified
among
the
faces
that
pass
one
in
the
street
and
they
differ
so
markedly
among
themselves
that
they
provide
a
new
and
accurate
means
of
classifying
varieties
among
the
races
of
the
species
man
the
thyroid
type
differs
as
much
from
the
adrenal
type
as
does
a
greyhound
from
a
the
greyhound
has
a
certain
size
form
character
and
capacity
the
has
similar
qualities
which
are
yet
quite
different
each
is
built
for
a
particular
career
among
human
beings
the
pure
thyroid
type
is
easily
distinguished
from
the
pure
adrenal
type
and
both
of
these
from
the
pure
pituitary
type
each
is
stamped
with
a
significant
figure
height
skin
hair
temperament
ambition
social
reactions
and
predisposition
to
certain
diseases
the
mixed
types
among
the
mixed
types
the
lines
of
distinction
are
less
clear
and
so
they
are
more
difficult
to
classify
the
mixed
types
may
be
said
to
be
hyphenated
in
them
two
or
even
three
of
the
internal
secretory
glands
conflict
for
predominance
the
combined
action
makes
for
a
resultant
modification
in
the
primary
glandular
markings
and
effects
a
hyphenated
classification
thus
becomes
inevitable
especially
is
this
so
if
the
two
glands
are
mutually
antagonistic
and
inhibitory
a
compromise
effect
is
then
necessitated
or
an
individual
may
be
dominated
by
one
gland
at
one
period
of
his
life
and
by
another
at
a
later
period
one
of
the
glands
the
thyroid
for
example
will
show
by
the
traces
it
has
left
upon
the
earliest
developing
features
that
it
was
in
control
at
the
very
earliest
dates
of
his
history
while
other
signs
will
disclose
the
more
recent
influence
of
the
adrenal
or
of
the
pituitary
the
combination
becomes
classifiable
as
the
type
or
as
the
type
that
the
external
features
as
well
as
the
chronic
diseases
of
human
beings
are
controlled
by
some
common
factor
has
long
been
suspected
inquiries
into
morbid
phenomena
with
a
hereditary
trend
yielded
information
that
has
paved
the
way
for
the
internal
secretion
theory
it
has
long
been
known
that
certain
diseases
effect
only
certain
individuals
of
a
definite
constitution
apoplexy
diabetes
arteriosclerosis
bright
disease
are
met
with
almost
exclusively
in
what
the
older
clinicians
talked
about
as
the
apopleptic
type
on
the
other
hand
they
said
anemias
tuberculosis
hemophilias
scrofulas
occurred
more
among
the
lymphatic
type
but
they
had
no
idea
whatever
of
the
true
functional
basis
of
the
two
different
types
the
truth
as
we
of
today
view
it
is
that
these
two
types
represent
different
textures
of
human
beings
fabricated
of
different
internal
secretions
they
are
really
two
different
breeds
of
the
species
homo
sapiens
the
materials
being
different
the
color
and
feel
of
them
is
different
and
the
resistance
to
wear
and
tear
is
different
endocrine
analysis
the
modes
of
classification
glimpsed
at
are
certainly
exceedingly
broad
and
sweeping
it
is
well
enough
to
establish
types
and
classes
but
beneath
them
are
sheltered
the
infinite
possibilities
of
permutations
and
combinations
which
explain
the
countless
variety
and
complexity
of
form
and
function
every
individual
born
among
the
vertebrates
for
example
must
have
a
certain
definite
amount
and
percentage
of
pituitary
gland
anterior
and
posterior
pineal
thyroid
parathyroid
thymus
adrenal
pancreas
interstitial
and
so
on
now
if
to
state
it
in
terms
of
percentages
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
pituitary
is
the
pineal
the
thyroid
the
parathyroids
the
thymus
the
adrenals
the
pancreas
the
interstitials
the
gland
when
acting
maximally
to
be
graded
as
we
see
at
once
how
different
such
an
individual
must
be
from
one
who
has
say
pituitary
pineal
thyroid
parathyroid
adrenals
pancreas
and
interstitials
one
obtains
at
once
from
the
contrasts
of
such
figures
some
idea
of
the
possibilities
as
each
point
plus
or
minus
must
count
to
produce
some
difference
in
the
individual
the
results
are
manifest
varying
within
the
numerical
limits
imposed
by
genus
species
variety
and
family
which
limits
are
probably
responsible
for
the
persistence
of
the
particular
genus
species
variety
or
family
the
individual
becomes
an
individual
because
of
the
relative
values
of
the
percentages
in
his
blood
and
tissues
of
these
different
internal
secretions
we
thus
begin
to
gain
an
insight
into
the
patterns
according
to
which
men
women
and
animals
are
woven
we
are
as
yet
far
from
an
exact
endocrine
analysis
of
the
individual
but
we
know
that
the
endocrines
rule
over
growth
and
nutrition
a
vast
dominion
which
incorporates
every
organ
and
every
tissue
by
enhancing
or
retarding
the
nutritional
changes
the
growth
of
the
organ
or
tissue
is
favored
or
restricted
the
size
and
shape
of
an
individual
as
a
whole
as
well
as
of
the
specialized
cell
masses
composing
him
as
hands
and
feet
the
nose
and
ears
and
so
on
are
therefore
controlled
by
them
whether
an
organism
is
to
be
tall
or
short
lean
or
corpulent
graceful
or
awkward
is
decided
by
their
interactions
these
like
human
covenants
vary
with
the
different
reactions
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
and
so
a
great
deal
depends
upon
whether
they
work
harmoniously
or
discordantly
and
upon
which
does
the
most
work
and
which
the
least
undersecretion
and
oversecretion
it
is
when
a
gland
either
in
the
course
of
development
or
because
of
the
influence
of
starvation
shock
injury
poisoning
or
infection
begins
to
undersecrete
or
oversecrete
that
its
effects
upon
growth
and
nutrition
become
grossly
manifest
a
veritable
transfiguration
of
the
individual
may
occur
the
black
magic
of
which
may
perplex
him
for
a
lifetime
a
man
made
eunuchoid
by
an
accident
or
by
mumps
will
observe
in
himself
astonishing
changes
in
his
constitutional
mentality
and
sexuality
he
would
be
more
astounded
to
learn
that
beneath
the
appearances
the
changes
so
alarming
him
there
are
profound
alterations
in
the
rate
at
which
he
is
taking
in
oxygen
burning
up
sugar
accumulating
carbon
dioxide
and
excreting
waste
byproducts
through
the
kidneys
which
are
responsible
for
them
the
differences
between
the
normal
and
abnormal
are
only
a
matter
of
degree
and
so
to
be
sure
are
differences
between
types
but
it
is
hard
to
realize
that
the
striking
distinctions
between
the
thyroid
type
and
the
pituitary
comparable
as
said
to
the
differences
between
a
greyhound
and
a
are
dependent
solely
upon
quantitative
variations
in
the
general
and
local
speeds
of
metabolism
among
the
cells
division
of
labor
besides
the
antagonisms
and
between
them
there
are
certain
lines
along
which
the
glands
in
their
effects
specialize
the
thyroid
for
instance
is
concerned
specially
with
the
regulation
of
the
shape
form
and
finish
of
an
organ
the
pituitary
shines
at
the
periods
of
developmental
crises
determining
them
and
modifying
them
it
exerts
the
greatest
influence
upon
the
time
of
eruption
of
the
teeth
both
the
temporary
and
the
permanent
the
onset
of
puberty
the
recurrence
of
menstruation
in
women
and
the
time
of
occurrence
of
labor
the
interstitial
glands
distribute
the
basis
of
the
powers
and
limitations
of
masculinity
and
femininity
abnormalities
of
these
glands
also
affect
the
individual
all
along
the
line
in
all
of
his
aspects
so
affected
he
may
apparently
change
into
a
wholly
different
being
he
may
change
in
size
in
the
shape
of
his
head
feet
and
hands
as
well
as
in
his
habits
aptitudes
and
dispositions
so
he
may
find
it
necessary
to
purchase
an
entirely
different
size
of
hat
more
commodious
clothes
and
newly
fitting
gloves
and
shoes
at
the
same
time
his
family
relatives
and
friends
discover
that
the
erstwhile
generous
frank
neat
and
punctual
and
liked
has
become
stingy
and
suspicious
and
slovenly
and
hated
and
all
because
a
gland
has
begun
to
undersecrete
or
to
oversecrete
the
transformation
will
be
slight
or
marked
depending
entirely
upon
the
extent
of
impairment
positive
or
negative
of
the
gland
involved
but
it
is
not
only
in
the
shaping
of
the
normal
architecture
that
the
internal
secretions
dominate
over
that
subtle
something
known
in
all
languages
as
vitality
expressive
of
the
intensity
of
feeling
thought
and
reactions
in
cells
they
rule
supreme
gay
vivacity
and
grim
determination
the
temperament
of
a
louis
xiv
and
the
soul
of
a
cromwell
are
the
crystallizations
of
these
chemical
substances
acting
upon
the
brain
internal
secretion
varieties
there
is
no
better
way
of
illustrating
the
influence
of
the
internal
secretions
upon
the
normal
than
the
analysis
of
the
variation
of
traits
with
variations
in
glandular
predominances
the
general
build
of
an
individual
his
skeletal
type
the
proportion
between
the
size
of
his
arms
and
that
of
his
legs
as
well
as
that
between
his
trunk
and
his
lower
extremities
whether
he
is
to
be
tall
lanky
and
loutish
or
short
squat
and
dumpy
are
to
be
considered
different
facial
types
are
the
expressions
of
underlying
endocrine
differences
the
head
and
skull
offer
a
number
of
clues
to
the
controlling
secretions
in
the
blood
and
tissues
whether
the
forehead
is
to
be
broad
or
narrow
the
distance
between
the
eyes
the
character
of
the
eyebrows
the
shape
and
size
and
appearance
of
the
eyes
themselves
the
mould
of
the
nose
and
jaws
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
teeth
are
all
so
determined
the
skin
in
its
color
texture
the
quantity
and
distribution
of
its
fatty
and
other
constituents
eruptions
and
weather
reactions
is
influenced
also
the
mucous
membranes
the
color
and
lustre
and
structure
of
the
hair
as
well
as
its
general
distribution
and
development
are
hieroglyphics
of
the
endocrine
processes
below
the
surface
whether
the
muscles
are
massive
or
sparse
atrophied
or
hypertrophied
soft
or
hard
easily
fatigable
or
not
bespeak
conditions
in
the
glandular
chain
in
short
we
must
regard
the
individual
as
an
immensely
complicated
pattern
of
designs
traced
by
the
hormones
as
the
primary
etchers
of
his
development
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
number
of
unknown
and
unsolved
relations
in
the
pattern
are
still
enormously
great
enough
has
been
established
to
make
possible
a
rough
working
analysis
of
the
particular
unique
organism
placed
before
us
for
examination
as
smith
jones
or
miss
what
is
the
normal
anthropologists
from
the
beginning
of
anthropology
have
battled
in
vain
for
a
satisfactory
inclusive
definition
or
at
least
description
of
the
normal
with
the
introduction
of
the
biometric
method
the
goal
at
last
appeared
within
sight
a
cocked
hat
curve
expressing
the
distribution
and
range
of
the
normal
looks
formidable
the
attainable
turned
out
a
mirage
for
the
curves
constructable
by
the
measurement
of
traits
of
a
population
only
proved
the
truth
of
the
old
axiom
that
all
transitions
and
variations
between
extremes
exist
the
problem
of
the
normal
seemed
more
elusive
than
ever
and
the
best
that
could
be
done
for
the
elucidation
of
its
mystery
was
to
apply
and
observe
the
law
of
averages
from
the
endocrine
standpoint
the
reason
for
this
becomes
clear
the
biometric
method
concerned
itself
with
externals
with
as
it
were
symptoms
since
these
external
signs
are
but
manifestations
of
the
inner
chemical
reactions
of
which
the
internal
secretions
are
the
determining
reagents
or
factors
with
permutations
and
combinations
possible
in
all
directions
the
diversity
and
variability
of
each
individual
and
his
traits
stands
explained
and
understandable
the
normal
as
the
perfect
or
nearly
perfect
balance
of
forces
in
the
organism
at
any
given
moment
emerges
as
a
more
definite
and
real
concept
than
that
which
would
abstract
it
from
a
curve
of
variations
moreover
since
the
directive
forces
within
the
organism
are
the
internal
secretions
the
normal
becomes
definable
as
their
harmonious
balancing
or
equilibrium
a
state
which
tends
not
to
undo
as
the
abnormal
does
but
to
prolong
itself
the
potential
combinations
and
compensations
antagonisms
and
counteractions
attainable
within
the
endocrine
glands
as
an
interlocking
directorate
point
the
cause
for
the
elusive
quality
of
the
normal
tall
men
and
short
men
blonde
women
and
dumpy
women
lanky
people
stout
people
falstaff
and
queen
elizabeth
george

abraham

disraeli
and
walt
whitman
caesar
and
alexander
as
well
as
smith
and
miss
jones
come
within
the
range
of
the
normal
there
are
all
kinds
and
conditions
and
sorts
of
men
and
women
and
all
kinds
and
sorts
and
conditions
of
the
normal
because
an
incalculable
number
of
harmonious
relations
and
interactions
between
the
endocrines
are
possible
and
do
actually
occur
the
standard
of
the
normal
must
obviously
not
be
a
single
standard
but
a
series
of
standards
depending
upon
which
glands
predominate
and
how
the
others
adapt
themselves
to
its
predominance
types
types

types
as
well
as
hyphenated
compounds
of
these
such
as

they
can
be
conceived
of
as
normal

because
they
exist
as

the
skeletal
types
now
men
for
as
long
as
we
have
any
knowledge
of
their
thoughts
and
classifications
and
attitudes
have
been
accustomed
to
first
think
of
one
another
to
classify
and
size
one
another
as
tall
or
short
slender
or
broad
thin
or
corpulent
the
biological
necessity
indeed
instinct
of
the
one
animal
to
relate
the
other
animal
to
aggressive
or
harmless
agencies
in
his
surroundings
accounts
for
this
relatively
of
course
for
all
these
modes
of
description
imply
offensive
or
defensive
possibilities
of
the
stimulus
for
the
recorder
in
relation
to
himself
the
interest
in
stature
is
fundamental
and
has
persisted
in
the
most
civilized
nations
the
relationship
of
height
and
weight
as
well
as
of
length
and
breadth
to
other
physical
traits
have
formed
the
subject
of
scientific
study
there
is
for
instance
the
classification
of
bean
who
divided
mankind
generally
into
two
types
those
of
a
medium
size
stocky
long
legs
and
arms
large
hands
and
feet
short
trunk
and
face
large
in
comparison
to
the
head
the
and
those
who
were
either
tall
and
slender
or
small
and
delicate
with
the
smaller
face
eyes
close
together
long
high
narrow
nose
and
trunk
longer
as
compared
with
the
extremities
the
bean
showed
too
that
the
hypers
to
use
a
short
word
to
contrast
with
the
mesos
were
present
to
the
extent
of
almost
a
hundred
per
cent
in
a
series
of
tuberculosis
and
about
ninety
per
cent
in
a
series
of
central
nervous
system
disease
all
of
which
is
exceedingly
interesting
and
suggestive
but
throws
no
light
upon
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
statures
stature
and
growth
stature
is
essentially
determined
by
the
growth
of
the
long
bones
they
are
the
and
the
muscles
and
soft
tissues
follow
the
pace
they
set
now
the
primary
determinant
catalyst
or
sensitizer
of
the
growth
of
the
long
bones
is
the
anterior
pituitary
all
statures
should
therefore
be
first
scrutinized
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
pituitary
individuals
over
six
feet
tall
or
under
five
feet
five
inches
should
be
looked
upon
as
having
a
pituitary
trend
this
pituitary
trend
may
be
primary
due
to
its
own
undergrowth
or
overgrowth
or
it
may
be
due
to
lack
of
inhibition
from
the
sex
glands
such
as
occurs
in
eunuchs
and
eunuchoids
or
excessive
or
premature
inhibition
from
them
as
happens
in
certain
salacious
dwarfs
the
long
bones
grow
at
a
point
of
junction
between
the
bone
proper
and
an
overlying
layer
of
gristle
or
cartilage
known
as
the
zone
of
ossification
it
is
upon
this
zone
of
ossification
that
the
various
growth
influences
appear
to
focus
and
concentrate
their
efforts
among
them
the
internal
secretions
after
growth
has
been
finished
that
is
after
adolescence
these
zones
of
ossification
close
so
that
growth
is
no
longer
possible
unless
they
become
reactivated
upon
the
zone
of
ossification
must
act
the
pituitary
and
indirectly
the
thyroid
the
interstitial
cells
the
thymus
and
the
adrenals
individuals
oversized
or
undersized
either
belong
to
the
pituitary
type
or
if
hyphenated
have
the
pituitary
as
one
of
the
dominants
in
their
composition
the
necessities
of
determine
a
greater
angle
between
trunk
and
lower
extremities
in
the
female
underactivity
of
the
pituitary
for
instance
will
prevent
the
development
of
the
normal
angle
the
ratio
in
length
of
the
upper
limbs
to
the
lower
is
a
fairly
constant
relationship
for
each
sex
normally
deviations
occur
with
a
break
somewhere
in
the
chain
of
cooperation
of
the
internal
secretions
controlling
the
growth
of
bone
hands
fingers
and
toes
the
size
and
shape
and
general
configuration
of
the
hands
fingers
and
toes
are
details
that
tell
an
endocrine
tale
students
of
hands
naturally
have
grouped
them
as
the
long
slender
and
the
short
broad
the
bony
and
the
out
the
tapering
fingers
and
the
stumpy
the
character
of
a
hand
is
determined
anatomically
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
bones
the
amount
and
distribution
of
fat
and
the
thickness
and
elasticity
of
the
skin
over
these
the
essential
control
lies
in
the
pituitary
and
the
thyroid
so
we
find
that
pituitary
types
have
when
there
is
oversecretion
large
bony
gross
hands
or
when
there
is
undersecretion
hands
that
are
plump
with
peculiarly
tapering
fleshy
fingers
the
hyperthyroid
has
long
slender
fingers
the
subthyroid
pudgy
coarse
ugly
foreshortened
hands
often
cold
and
bluish
facial
types
an
artist
will
see
in
a
face
the
past
history
of
generations
a
narrative
of
the
adventures
of
the
blood
a
record
of
tears
and
smiles
wrinkles
and
dimples
the
victories
and
defeats
of
buried
drudgery
and
romance
these
signatures
which
the
faculty
of
life
have
scribbled
or
engraved
over
it
as
upon
a
diploma
bespeak
for
him
spiritual
moments
to
the
student
of
the
internal
secretions
the
lines
expressions
attitudes
are
important
for
they
tell
of
the
state
of
tensions
and
strains
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
with
which
they
are
inseparably
connected
it
is
when
one
comes
to
the
consideration
of
the
face
as
a
complex
of
brows
eyes
nose
lips
and
jaws
that
he
becomes
most
interested
for
in
the
modeling
and
tone
of
every
one
of
the
features
each
of
the
endocrine
glands
has
something
to
say
in
consequence
there
has
been
described
the
hyperpituitary
face
and
the
hyperthyroid
face
the
subthyroid
face
and
the
subpituitary
face
the
adrenal
face
the
eunuchoid
face
and
the
ovarian
face
and
also
the
thymic
to
bring
to
mind
an
immediate
complete
image
of
the
hyperthyroid
face
one
should
think
of
shelley
the
oval
shape
of
it
with
the
delicate
modeling
of
all
the
features
the
wide
high
brow
the
large
vivacious
prominent
eyes
with
the
glint
of
a
divine
fire
in
them
and
the
sensitive
lips
all
belong
to
the
classical
picture
generally
flushed
over
the
there
is
undoubtedly
a
certain
effeminate
effect
associated
with
it
at
least
it
is
the
least
animal
and
brutish
of
the
faces
of
man
on
the
other
hand
the
subthyroid
face
is
that
of
the
cretin
and
cretinoid
idiot
in
a
mild
degree
so
characteristic
that
we
recognize
the
portrait
in
the
descriptions
of
pliny
in
early
roman
tunes
and
of
marco
polo
in
his
asiatic
travels
coarseness
dullness
pudginess
are
its
keynotes
irregular

to
wide
separation
of

nose
sallow
puffy

waxy
thickened

the
catalogue
of
the
physiognomy
on
the
whole
the
sort
of
face
one
passes
in
the
street
as
stupid
and
common
but
there
are
a
number
of
fascinating
and
marvelous
varieties
of
the
stupid

is
most
often
dark

freckled
it
tends
to
be
irregularly
broadish
it
is
hairy
one
is
struck
forcibly
there
is
a

appear
rather
low

is
a
complacence

the

on

the

seem
proportional
to
the

of

when

are

rapid
decay

to

the

suffer
particularly

disturbances
of

the
saying
a

is
said
to
have
its
equivalent
in

language
the
bicuspids
and
second
permanent

erupt
around
puberty
when
profound
readjustments
are
going
on
among
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
they
consequently
suffer
with
their
abnormalities
or
divergences
from

thus
furnish
a
good

of
information
concerning
the

the

the
skin
is
influenced
in
its
color
moisture
hairiness
texture
fat
content
and
disease
vulnerability
by
the

the
question
of
color
is
very
interesting
for
it
is
probably
the
expression
of
the
blending
action
of
the
different
internal
secretions
davenport
the
american
student
of
heredity
and
eugenics
has
shown
that
neither
white
nor
black
skins
are
either
perfectly
white
or
perfectly
black
but
are
mixtures
in
various
proportions
of
black
yellow
red
and
white
the
exact
percentages
of
the
pigments
in
each
particular
skin
can
be
determined
by
means
of
a
rotating
disc
thus
a
white
skin
may
have
the
following
composition
black
red
yellow
white
the
composition
of
the
skin
of
a
very
black
negro
may
be
black
red
yellow
white
now
the
fact
that
in
addison
disease
in
which
the
adrenals
are
destroyed
there
occurs
a
coincident
increase
in
the
black
in
the
skin
and
other
evidence
pointing
to
adrenal
implication
in
dark
complexioned
white
people
as
well
as
in
those
possessing
pigmented
spots
seems
to
indicate
the
adrenals
as
controllers
of
the
black
and
white
factors
davenport
has
concluded
that
there
are
two
double
factors
for
black
pigmentation
in
the
negro
which
are
separately
inheritable
the
determinants
of
the
red
and
yellow
have
still
to
be
worked
out
the
moistness
of
the
skin
as
perspiration
depends
upon
the
number
and
activity
of
the
sweat
glands
it
varies
with
the
water
content
of
the
body
the
state
of
the
vegetative
nervous
system
and
the
body
temperature
thus
the
skin
of
the
hyperthyroid
and
the
subadrenal
is
soft
and
moist
because
of
their
antagonistic
effects
upon
the
sympathetic
system
the
subthyroid
and
the
hyperadrenal
have
dry
and
harsh
skins
for
the
same
reason
if
no
other
glands
intervene
however
in
both
of
the
latter
if
there
is
a
persistent
thymus
the
skin
will
retain
the
bland
quality
of
adolescence
there
is
a
curious
variation
among
the
different
internal
secretion
types
in
the
reaction
of
the
skin
to
stroking
when
the
skin
especially
the
skin
over
the
shoulders
the
breasts
and
the
abdomen
is
stroked
with
some
blunt
object
the
blood
vessels
react
either
by
a
greater
filling
up
or
emptying
of
themselves
the
latter
occurs
most
regularly
in
the
subadrenal
types
the
former
in
the
hyperthyroid
both
forms
of
reaction
run
parallel
to
the
different
check
or
drive
effects
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
with
too
much
drive
that
is
too
much
thyroid
there
is
the
flushing
reaction
with
too
little
check
that
is
with
too
little
adrenal
there
is
the
whitening
these
differences
probably
explain
the
emotional
reactions
of
the
face
in
anger
for
example
some
people
become
a
dead
white
others
a
fiery
red
whether
one
will
do
one
or
the
other
may
depend
upon
the
relative
predominance
of
the
thyroid
or
of
adrenal
in
the
individual
in
the
distribution
of
fat
beneath
and
throughout
the
skin
all
of
the
endocrine
glands
appear
to
have
a
voice
the
typically
hyperthyroid
and
hyperpituitary
individuals
tend
to
be
thin
as
well
also
as
those
who
have
or
excessively
functional
interstitial
cells
in
all
of
these
the
administration
of
the
respective
internal
secretions
increases
the
burning
up
of
material
in
the
body
and
all
of
them
have
a
higher
rate
of
tissue
combustion
than
their
confreres
with
a
subthyroid
or
subpituitary
keynote
in
their
cell
chemistry
or
with
insufficient
interstitial
cell
action
generally
the
latter
have
a
very
dry
skin
the
former
a
moist
skin
with
delayed
involution
of
the
pineal
obesity
results
the
elasticity
of
the
skin
is
another
quality
that
varies
with
the
concentration
in
the
blood
of
the
internal
secretions
elasticity
of
the
skin
its
recoil
upon
being
stretched
like
a
rubber
band
may
be
taken
as
a
measure
of
the
activity
of
all
the
endocrine
glands
for
as
can
be
noticed
especially
upon
the
back
of
the
hand
the
older
a
man
grows
the
less
elastic
becomes
the
skin
in
older
people
raising
the
skin
upon
the
back
of
the
hand
will
cause
it
to
stand
up
as
a
ridge
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
slowly
to
return
to
the
level
of
the
surrounding
skin
whereas
in
a
youthful
person
it
will
quickly
snap
back
into
place
this
quality
of
elasticity
of
the
skin
is
due
to
the
presence
in
it
of
the
yellow
elastic
fibres
cell
products
with
a
resilience
greater
than
anything
devised
by
man
the
preservation
of
the
resilience
is
a
function
of
the
internal
secretions
thus
after
loss
of
the
thyroid
the
ridging
effect
characteristic
of
senility
can
be
produced
in
one
young
as
measured
by
his
years
it
has
been
said
that
a
man
is
as
old
as
his
arteries
and
also
that
as
he
is
as
old
as
his
skin
it
might
better
be
said
that
he
is
as
old
as
his
elastic
tissue
young
when
he
is
rich
in
it
old
when
poor
and
losing
it
and
as
elastic
tissue
and
internal
secretions
stand
in
the
relation
of
created
and
creators
or
at
least
preserved
and
preservers
a
man
may
be
said
to
be
as
old
that
is
as
young
fresh
and
active
as
his
ductless
glands
the
hair
there
is
no
characteristic
of
the
human
body
except
perhaps
the
teeth
more
influenced
in
its
quality
texture
amount
and
distribution
than
the
hair
and
again
each
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
plays
a
part
but
most
importantly
the
thyroid
the
suprarenal
cortex
and
the
interstitial
sex
glands
all
contribute
their
specific
effect
and
the
blend
the
sum
of
the
additions
and
subtractions
constituting
their
influences
appears
as
a
specific
trait
of
the
individual
a
trait
so
significant
as
to
be
used
by
the
professionals
absorbed
in
the
study
of
man
the
anthropologists
as
a
criterion
of
racial
classifications
some
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
the
normal
growth
of
hair
is
necessary
to
its
understanding
there
develops
during
the
life
of
the
fetus
within
the
womb
a
curious
sort
of
wooly
hair
everywhere
over
the
entire
body
excepting
the
palms
and
soles
which
remain
hairless
throughout
life
remarkably
soft
and
fluttery
the
lanugo
at
about
the
eighth
month
of
existence
a
good
deal
of
this
lanugo
is
lost
to
be
replaced
on
the
head
and
eyebrows
by
a
crop
of
thick
coarse
pigmented
real
hair
so
it
happens
that
at
birth
the
infant
hair
is
a
queerly
irregular
growth
a
mixture
of
what
is
left
of
the
general
lanugo
development
and
the
localized
patches
of
the
more
human
hair
until
puberty
this
children
hair
remains
the
same
although
at
times
particularly
after
dentition
and
after
infectious
diseases
which
undoubtedly
alter
the
relations
of
the
internal
secretions
changes
of
color
and
texture
occur
then
with
sexual
ripening
there
appear
in
males
the
terminal
hairs
over
the
cheeks
and
lips
and
chin
and
in
both
sexes
in
the
folds
under
the
shoulders
and
over
the
lower
abdomen
the
hair
which
might
be
distinguished
as
the
sex
hair
in
contradistinction
to
the
juvenile
hair
of
the
head
the
extremities
and
the
back
now
the
smoothness
of
the
face
in
children
is
connected
with
the
activity
of
the
thymus
and
pineal
glands
among
individuals
in
whom
the
juvenile
thymus
persists
after
puberty
no
growth
of
hair
occurs
on
the
face
and
in
precocious
involution
or
destruction
of
the
pineal
hair
appears
on
the
face
and
in
other
terminal
regions
in
children
of
six
or
less
a
symptom
classical
in
the
child
who
suffered
from
a
tumor
of
the
pineal
and
discussed
immortality
with
his
physicians
it
is
probable
that
these
thymus
and
pineal
effects
are
indirect
through
their
action
upon
the
sex
glands
for
in
the
types
with
persistent
juvenile
thymus
there
occurs
a
maldevelopment
of
the
sex
glands
while
in
those
with
early
pineal
recession
the
sex
glands
bloom
simultanously
with
the
appearance
of
adolescent
hair
and
mental
traits
the
hastening
of
sexual
hair
by
tumors
of
the
adrenal
gland
may
also
be
put
down
to
a
release
from
restraint
of
the
interstitial
sex
cells
there
are
certain
spheres
in
the
hair
geography
of
the
body
over
which
particular
glands
may
be
said
to
rule
or
to
possess
a
mandate
the
hair
of
the
head
seems
to
be
primarily
under
the
control
of
the
thyroid
thus
in
cretins
reconstructed
by
thyroid
feeding
the
straight
rather
animal
hair
becomes
lustrous
and
fine
silken
and
curly
in
the
thyroid
deficiency
of
adults
a
prominent
phenomenon
often
is
the
falling
out
of
the
hair
in
handfuls
baldness
is
frequently
associated
with
a
progressive
decrease
of
the
concentration
of
thyroid
in
the
blood
at
the
same
time
there
tends
to
be
a
thinning
of
the
eyebrows
especially
of
the
outer
third
the
hair
of
the
face
in
males
and
the
other
terminal
hairs
in
both
males
and
females
is
regulated
by
the
sex
glands
primarily
in
the
female
the
ovary
that
is
to
say
the
interstitial
cells
of
the
ovary
inhibit
the
growth
of
hair
upon
the
face
in
destructive
disease
of
the
ovaries
as
well
as
in
other
affections
of
it
hair
in
the
form
of
moustache
beard
and
whiskers
may
appear
in
female
that
is
why
in
women
after
the
grand
sex
change
of
life
the
menopause
hair
often
grows
in
the
typically
male
regions
because
of
loss
of
the
inhibiting
influence
of
the
ovarian
internal
secretion
upon
them
after
castration
of
the
ovaries
the
same
may
result
removal
of
the
male
sex
glands
or
disturbances
of
them
will
interfere
with
the
proper
development
of
the
normal
facial
hair
of
the
hair
of
the
chest
the
abdomen
and
the
back
the
adrenals
seem
to
be
the
controllers
adrenal
types
have
hairy
chests
in
males
and
hair
on
the
back
in
females
they
have
also
a
good
deal
of
hair
upon
the
abdomen
the
hair
on
the
extremities
varies
a
good
deal
with
the
pituitary
people
with
hair
upon
hands
arms
and
legs
alone
are
generally
pituitary
or
have
a
striking
pituitary
streak
in
their
when
the
adrenals
increase
in
size
in
childhood
a
remarkable
triad
follows
general
hairiness
adiposity
and
sexual
precocity
one
fact
should
be
noted
when
the
adrenals
evoke
precocity
and
an
early
awakening
of
the
secondary
sex
characteristics
it
is
a
masculine
precocity
and
an
approximation
to
the
masculine
even
in
females
there
is
a
definite
trend
toward
an
increase
of
the
male
in
the
individual
composition
at
the
expense
of
the
female
we
shall
have
to
consider
this
in
greater
detail
when
we
analyze
the
internal
secretion
basis
of
masculinity
and
femininity
in
general
the
degree
of
general
hairiness
is
an
index
to
the
amount
of
adrenal
influence
upon
the
organism
all
the
endocrines
which
affect
the
hair
growth
also
act
upon
the
sebaceous

the

when
its

rival
the

the

muscles
it
would
seem
at
first
sight
that
organs
like
muscles
mechanical
instruments
for
the
manipulation
of
the
organism
in
space
would
be
more
or
less
independent
of
the
subtler
processes
of
internal
chemistry
of
the
blood
and
tissues
but
no
assumption
would
be
more
beside
the
mark
just
as
much
as
the
bones
and
viscera
the
teeth
and
the
hair
they
show
grossly
how
they
are
being
influenced
by
all
the
endocrine
glands
so
thyroid
types
generally
have
a
skeleton
sparsely
covered
with
a
muscular
mantle
pituitary
types
have
large
muscles
the
pineal
gland
has
some
definite
relation
to
muscle
chemistry
not
yet
probed
thus
it
has
been
shown
that
when
the
pineal
has
been
completely
destroyed
prematurely
by
lime
deposits
in
it
there
is
concomitant
a
wasting
of
muscles
in
places
this
waste
is
sometimes
replaced
by
fat
pictures
and
images
in
wood
and
stone
of
these
muscle
freaks
dating
from
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
century
are
in
existence
then
there
is
the
extraordinary
fatigability
of
the
muscles
which
occurs
in
the
thymus
types
who
nevertheless
have
large
muscles
a
paradox
of
contradiction
between
anatomy
and
physiology
such
a
type
for
instance
may
be
picked
out
by
a
football
coach
for
an
important
position
in
a
simply
on
the
tremendous
impressiveness
of
the
muscle
only
to
see
him
bowled
over
and
out
in
the
first
scrimmage
the
tone
of
muscles
the
quality
of
resisting
firmness
or
yielding
softness
is
essentially
determined
by
the
adrenal
glands
especially
in
time
of
stress
and
strain
was
the
first
to
show
that
extracts
of
sex
glands
could
increase
the
capacity
for
muscular
work
whether
this
was
a
direct
effect
upon
the
muscles
or
indirect
through
the
nerves
or
other
endocrines
no
one
can
say
certainly
the
carriage
of
an
individual
outer
symptom
of
the
inner
tonus
among
his
muscles
and
tendons
may
be
said
to
be
as
distinctively
an
endocrine
affair
as
the
color
of
his
skin
and
like
its
variations
variations
of
their
tone
development
reactivity
fatigability
and
endurance
may
be
traced
to
corresponding
states
of
overaction
or
underaction
and
odd
combinations
of
the
different
hormones
much
remains
to
be
learned
about
them
and
the
manner
of
their
control
such
an
affliction
as
flatfoot
dependent
upon
a
laxity
of
the
ligaments
in
one
who
seems
perfectly
healthy
and
strong
may
lead
the
analyst
back
to
a
personality
that
is
but
one
example
since
too
muscle
attitudes
muscle
tensions
and
muscle
relaxations
play
so
large
a
part
in
the
production
of
fundamental
mental
states
the

and

the

apparatus
enters
to

its

it
needs
a

to
chant
the

of

the
mystery
of
it
puzzled
the
minds
of

the

the

yet
the
homer
of

through
the
ages
is
still
to
come
but
at
all
times
the
mystery
evoked
speculation
and
attempt
at
explanation
acting
upon
their
theories
as
to
the
nature
and
function
of
sex
men
have
ever
since
the
passing
of
the
primeval
matriarchates
segregated
women
equalized
them
worshipped
them
or
enslaved
them
opinions
have
varied
from
ancient
national
aphorisms
to
the
effect
that
women
have
no
souls
to
the
most
ultramodern
utterances
of
that
the
differences
between
men
and
women
are
the
differences
between
two
species
there
are
other
epigrams
vast
sweeping
generalities
extant
concerning
the
nature
of
sex
and
women
particularly
all
partake
of
the
complexity
of
truth
and
therefore
own
a
certain
validity
still
since
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
items
have
been
based
upon
superficial
observations
colored
by
the
tradition
and
verbiage
of
the
milieu
they
are
valuable
more
as
human
documents
as

not
that
all
the

of

the
magic
of
the
emotions
of
shelley
and
poe
for
instance
with
their
marvelous
music
and
exquisite
intonings
of
feeling
furnish
us
with
important
information
they
are
the
facts
of
the
sex
life
as
much
as
the
song
of
the
nightingale
or
the
mocking
laughter
of
the
cuckoo
pursued
by
its
mate
so
sappho
and
elizabeth
browning
to
take
only
two
samples
have
contributed
some
of
the
feminine
reaction
the
erotic
motive
in
literature
has
but
paralleled
the
erotic
motive
in
life
with
all
of
its
vagaries
delusions
confusions
ecstasies
and
suffering
we
have
had
concerning
sex
not
knowledge
but
a
series
of
attitudes
the
attitude
of
virtue
the
attitude
of
pruriency
the
attitude
of
good
taste
the
attitude
of
the
theoretic
libertine
the
attitude
of
the
satyr
vulgarity
all
these
poses
of
course
have
supplied
not
an
iota
to
an
understanding
of
the
foundations
of
the
problems
of
sex
biologically
considered
thus
a
masculine
master
has
coined
that
immortal
phrase
the
eternal
feminine
and
in
a
matriarchate
we
should
undoubtedly
hear
of
the
eternal
masculine
each
leaves
one
as
unenlightened
as
the
other
a
rough
and
ready
code
of
life
attributes
certain
grossly
characteristic
qualities
of
mind
and
body
to
each
sex
this
is
supposed
to
be
enough
for
common
sense
beyond
that
the
mystery
has
been
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
that
perhaps
explains
the
enormous
popularity
of
contemporary
pornographic
and
sex
literature
there
are
bound
up
with
sex
feeling
and
sex
knowledge
many
customs
beliefs
and
habits
many
legal
statutes
and
social
institutions
in
the
complex
that
is
called
sentiment
to
which
science
looms
as
the
sacrilegious
ogre
who
devours
romance
without
spending
space
upon
the
ravages
of
the
sentimental
idealist
certainly
responsible
for
as
much
human
disaster
as
the
brutal
realist
it
is
manifest
that
a
revolution
in
sex
standards
and
relations
is
inevitable
as
soon
as
the
new
doctrines
filter
down
as
matters
of
fact
to
the
levels
of
the
common
intelligence
and
surely
nothing
else
could
be
wished
for
in
the
world
desired
by
all
of
us
the
world
ruled
by
intelligence
and
intelligent
good
will
sex
chemistry
a
few
general
statements
may
be
put
down
outright
as
material
to
go
upon
before
we
proceed
to
details
femininity
and
masculinity
have
a
definite
chemical
basis
in
the
reactions
of
the
internal
secretions
of
which
they
are
the
expression
that
is
to
say
that
just
as
a
precipitate
of
chalk
is
formed
when
one
throws
some
carbonate
of
soda
into
lime
water
so
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
precipitates
and
crystallizations
of
a
long
series
of
linked
chemical
reactions
in
the
fluids
of
the
body
in
which
the
internal
secretions
play
a
determining
part
femininity
and
masculinity
are
expressions
of
the
interplay
of
all
the
internal
secretions
it
used
to
be
said
by
smart
cats
and
accepted
by
the
tabby
cats
that
a
woman
was
a
woman
because
of
her
ovaries
alone
it
is
being
said
by
some
great
discoverers
of
the
day
that
man
is
a
man
because
of
his
testes
alone
neither
of
these
dogmas
is
true
there
are
individuals
with
ovaries
who
show
every
deviation
from
the
feminine
and
there
are
individuals
with
testes
who
exhibit
every
variation
from
the
masculine
the
other
endocrine
glands
are
of
equal
importance
there
is
no
absolute
masculine
or
absolute
feminine
the
ideals
of
the
manly
man
and
the
womanly
woman
were
erected
by
the
blind
ignorance
of
the
nineteenth
century
illusionists
and
a
line
drawn
to
cleave
them
but
indeed
biologically
there
exists
every
transition
between
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
the
explanation
of
these
different
sex
types
consists
in
the
different
admixtures
of
the
internal
secretions
possible
and
actual
when
we
speak
of
the
feminine
we
really
mean
the
predominantly
feminine
and
when
we
speak
of
the
masculine
we
mean
the
mainly
masculine
between
all
sorts
of
transitions
are
possible
and
occur
man
in
relation
to
the
internal
secretions
we
have
considered
in
reviewing
the
interstitial
cells
to
him
we
shall
return
later
let
us
turn
now
to
that
fascinating
subject
of
the
ages
woman
what
produces
and
maintains
the
feminine
the
cause
of
sex
to
all
appearances
that
inscrutable
simplest
of
living
things
the
fertilized
ovum
beginning
of
the
human
starts
bisexual
double
sexed
both
masculine
and
feminine
or
perhaps
neither
masculine
nor
feminine
then
a
form
develops
then
within
that
form
a
patch
of
cells
arise
which
the
microscopist
recognizes
as
the
forerunners
of
the
male
or
the
female
reproductive
cells
then
some
more
development
and
at
birth
sex
is
definitely
settled
as
far
as
the
reproductive
organs
are
concerned
our
knowledge
here
as
everywhere
is
still
fragmentary
statistical
reviews
seem
to
show
that
in
times
of
stress
war
famine
pestilence
more
boys
are
born
than
girls
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
it
sheds
no
further
light
on
the
subject
monosexuality
is
a
distinction
of
the
human
species
the
sexes
are
pretty
clearly
differentiated
in
some
animals
such
as
some
worms
there
is
a
bisexuality
of
the
individual
there
are
present
the
reproductive
organs
of
both
sexes
capable
of
impregnating
other
individuals
as
well
as
of
being
impregnated
in
some
of
these
even
may
occur
this
is
the
condition
of
hermaphroditism
but
the
higher
up
one
goes
in
the
scale
of
evolution
the
greater
becomes
the
distinction
between
the
sexes
anatomic
hermaphroditism
becomes
a
rare
anomaly
life
appears
to
have
perfected
this
trick
of
separate
sexes
sex
specialization
in
short
for
the
sake
of
the
efficiency
which
goes
with
specialization
when
a
germ
cell
divides
its
nuclear
material
breaks
up
into
segments
known
as
chromosomes
now
it
has
been
found
for
example
in
the
case
of
the
common
squash
bug
anasa
tristis
that
there
are
chromosomes
in
the
female
and
in
the
male
in
the
female
two
of
these
are
visibly
different
from
the
rest
while
in
the
male
there
is
one
odd
one
the
remaining
being
like
the
corresponding
of
the
female
before
the
germ
cell
becomes
fit
to
mix
with
a
germ
cell
of
opposite
sex
in
the
process
of
fertilization
it
must
lose
one
half
of
these
so
the
number
of
chromosomes
for
the
species
is
kept
the
same
or
constant
this
is
the
process
of
maturation
in
the
process
when
the
chromosome
number
is
halved
among
the
females
go
into
each
mature
egg
but
among
the
males
the
odd
chromosome
also
known
as
the
can
perforce
go
only
into
half
of
the
sperm
cells
leaving
the
others
without
it
so
the
sperm
are
formed
in
equal
numbers
of
and
chromosomes
respectively
when
fertilization
occurs
and
the
sperm
cell
fuses
with
the
egg
the
following
may
take
place
a
ten
chromosome
sperm
may
unite
with
the
eleven
chromosome
egg
and
produce
a
chromosome
individual
or
an
eleven
chromosome
sperm
may
unite
with
an
eleven
chromosome
egg
producing
a
chromosome
individual
it
has
been
found
that
the
chromosome
individual
invariably
develops
into
a
female
and
the
into
a
male
therefore
femaleness
is
a
positive
quality
dependent
upon
the
action
of
the
and
maleness
an
absence
of
femaleness
due
to
lack
of
the
extra
odd
chromosome
in
man
two
have
been
discovered
half
the
sperm
containing
and
the
other
half
containing
only
chromosomes
the
number
of
chromosomes
in
human
cells
consequently
is
in
the
male
and
in
the
female
the
is
the
bearer
of
sex
destiny
there
still
remains
the
work
to
be
done
on
the
actual
control
of
sex
by
man
apart
from
its
natural
determination
for
the
time
being
let
the
feminists
glory
in
the
fact
that
they
have
two
more
chromosomes
to
each
cell
than
their
opponents
certainly
there
can
be
no
talk
here
of
a
natural
inferiority
of
women
the
secondary
or
endocrine
sex
traits
yet
the
matter
is
after
all
not
so
simple
as
this
would
make
it
out
to
be
all
that
can
be
safely
laid
down
is
that
the
character
of
the
reproductive
organs
is
determined
by
the
extra
chromosomes
and
though
these
reproductive
organs
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
masculine
or
feminine
quality
of
the
organism
as
a
whole
through
their
internal
secretions
they
are
not
alone
all
the
other
internal
secretions
have
their
say
in
the
final
outcome
determining
what
may
be
called
the
dominant
sex
quality
but
leaving
inherent
the
latent
soil
of
the
other
sex
this
may
become
active
and
dominant
in
its
turn
under
certain
conditions
of
stimulation
abnormality
or
disease
dependent
upon
a
rearrangement
of
status
and
influence
among
the
ductless
glands
bisexuality
preceded
monosexuality
in
the
animal
pedigree
and
with
it
even
at
the
highest
points
of
the
genealogical
tree
while
from
the
standpoint
of
the
species
the
criterion
of
the
sex
classification
of
its
members
will
depend
upon
their
capacity
to
fertilize
or
to
be
fertilized
a
quality
that
may
therefore
be
spoken
of
as
the
primary
sex
character
a
number
of
other
traits
have
been
evolved
by
sexual
selection
the
secondary
sex
traits
they
have
come
to
be
just
as
important
to
the
individual
as
far
as
his
or
her
consciousness
of
sex
attitudes
and
reactions
to
it
are
concerned
the
terms
primary
and
secondary
sex
characteristics
though
inapt
must
be
allowed
to
stand
these
accessory
traits
undoubtedly
survived
because
of
their
usefulness
in
external
adornment
for
attracting
attention
in
courtship
in
the
metabolic
requirements
of
sex
combat
and
the
sex
act
and
in
the
necessities
of
caring
for
the
young
until
the
rooster
comb
and
spurs
the
male
frog
claspers
the
antlers
and
so
on
are
familiarly
and
obviously
so
useful
besides
there
are
fundamental
differences
in
inner
physiology
the
human
male
consumes
more
oxygen
than
the
female
per
minute
since
he
has
more
red
corpuscles
in
his
blood
in
some
caterpillars
the
blood
is
yellow
in
the
males
and
green
in
the
females
thomas
has
devoted
an
essay
of
some
fifty
pages
to
a
review
of
the
organic
differences
between
man
and
woman
the
ordinary
criteria
employed
every
day
by
the
man
in
the
street
to
distinguish
man
from
woman
may
be
arranged
as
follows
hair
on
face
hairless
face
skin
coarse
and
lean
skin
fine
and
plump
muscles
powerful
relatively
weak
bones
heavy
bones
light
aggressive
bass
voice
reserved
treble
voice
the
rôle
of
the
ovaries
while
the
primary
sex
characters
as
such
are
present
and
distinguishable
from
birth
quite
the
opposite
holds
for
the
secondary
sex
traits
during
childhood
they
are
in
abeyance
or

most
of

with

comes
a
marked
change
of
attitude
toward
the

puberty
is
the
time
of
ripening
of
the
specific
germ
cells
it
is
then
the
ovaries
begin
to
secrete
ova
ripe
for
fertilization
and
the
testes
begin
to
secrete
sperm
ready
to
fertilize
before
this
can
happen
an
event
announced
in
the
female
by
the
onset
of
menstruation
two
conditions
must
be
fulfilled
in
the
endocrine
history
of
the
individual
there
must
be
a
certain
atrophy
and
retrogression
of
the
thymus
gland
and
there
must
likewise
be
a
similar
atrophy
and
retirement
of
the
pineal
gland
both
of
these
involutions
of
the
glands
of
childhood
must
occur
before
the
normal
hypertrophy
and
development
of
the
sex
glands
and
their
secretions
can
start
besides
there
must
be
a
minimum
activity
of
the
thyroid
adrenal
and
pituitary
glands
without
them
below
a
certain
minimum
the
reproductive
organs
and
their
secretions
will
remain
infantile
causing
a
persistent
infantilism
or
delay
of
puberty
formerly
there
was
ascribed
to
the
ovaries
in
a
lump
and
without
qualification
an
absolute
despotism
over
the
specifically
feminine
functions
of
menstruation
gestation
parturition
and
lactation
nowadays
we
see
its
domain
as
a
limited
monarchy
if
not
indeed
as
one
sovereign
state
of
a
republic
a
member
equal
but
not
superior
to
the
others
of
a
board
of
directors
its
true
business
comes
down
to
two
particular
rôles
first
the
production
of
ova
and
second
the
secretion
of
a
hormone
or
hormones
over
the
other
functions
once
supposed
its
monopoly
all
the
ductless
glands
rule
what
concerns
us
now
is
its
internal
secretion
or
secretions
one
of
them
is
known
as
lutein
and
it
has
never
been
chemically
isolated
in
its
pure
form
the
existence
of
lutein
like
the
existence
of
electricity
is
an
inference
something
we
are
sure
is
there
because
of
its
effects
it
originates
in
a
remarkable
part
of
the
ovary
the
corpus
luteum
besides
there
are
the
products
of
the
interstitial
cells
the
creations
of
a
special
layer
of
cells
around
the
ovum
the
membrana
granulosa
they
produce
a
substance
tonic
to
the
uterus
when
the
ovaries
are
removed
there
occurs
an
atrophy
of
the
womb
muscle
due
to
loss
of
this
tonic
substance
this
atrophy
accompanied
by
an
abolition
of
the
normal
periodic
uterine
contraction
makes
conditions
unfavorable
to
pregnancy
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
secretion
of
the
corpus
luteum
is
necessary
for
the
complete
progress
of
a
pregnancy
cases
are
on
record
however
of
ovaries
taken
out
soon
after
the
onset
of
pregnancy
without
interference
with
the
gestation
castration
is
comparable
in
every
way
with
the
menopause
or
the
time
of
cessation
of
sexual
life
a
process
that
might
be
called
it
produces
certain
general
constitutional
effects
adiposity
often
develops
undoubtedly
associated
with
underfunction
of
the
thyroid
and
pituitary
glands
the

breathes
less

burns
up
less

there
is
some
disturbance
of
the

with
an
increased
excitability
of
the

is
the
release
of
some

that

some

others

they

are

forms

in

dependent
upon

but
these
forms
are
masculinisms
a
masculinization
of

not
a

so
one
must
distinguish
sharply
between
a
precocity

masculinization
and
precocity
of
premature
feminization
the
latter
always
implies
the
touch

sexual
precocity
in
boys
may
be
produced
by
a
premature
overactivity
not
only
of
the
specific
reproductive
organs
the
testes
but
also
by
an
early
excess
of
secretion
on
the
part
of
the
cortex
of
the
adrenal
gland
or
the
pituitary
gland
or
by
a
too
early
involution
of
the
pineal
or
thymus
when
such
abnormalities
of
adrenal
pituitary
thymus
or
pineal
occur
in
girls
it
is
the
masculine
streak
in
the
hastening
of
growth
that
is
made
manifest
all
this
emphasizes
the
relative
bisexuality
of
every
normal

matter
how
pronounced
when

the
most
marked
virility
or

becomes
conceivable
and
occurs
the
secret
of
the
masculine
masculinization
having
entered
upon
the
scene
one
may
well
ask
what
truly
which
means
chemically
lies
behind
all
these
differences
and
divergences
between
male
and
female
what
is
the
secret
of
the
variable
internal

admixtures
you
can
tell
us
that
the
recipes
are
different
the
ingredients
different
the
results
different
as
a
nesselrode
pudding
is
from
say
a
rice
pudding
but
what
is
the
inner
mechanism
of
the
process
since
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
are
but
expressions
of
certain
relative
capacities
and
potentialities
some
single
principle
must
run
through
the
making
of
both
recognizing
of
course
the
qualifications
inherent
in
so
broad
a
statement
the
answer
is
the
handling
of
the
lime
salts
life
originated
or
at
least
lived
and
worked
for
long
ages
in
sea
water
during
these
eras
the
salts
of
the
sea
have
come
to
play
a
dominant
rôle
in
its
being
the
lime
salts
because
of
their
peculiar
properties
of
dissolving
or
precipitating
themselves
according
to
electrical
conditions
in
their
medium
have
come
to
occupy
a
central
position
in
all
the
processes
of
growth
metabolism
and
sex
differentiation
so
it
is
that
masculinity
may
be
described
as
a
stable
constant
state
in
the
organism
of
lime
salts
and
the
feminine
as
an
unstable
variable
state
of
lime
salts
the
male
skeleton
contrasts
with
the
female
as
the
stronger
larger
heavier
and
straighter
because
it
is
an
expression
of
a
greater
capacity
to
utilize
store
and
keep
lime
in
the
system
women
throughout
their
reproductive
period
are
liable
to
rapid
and
fluctuations
of
their
lime
content
menstruation
pregnancy
lactation
all
draw
upon
the
stores
of
lime
sometimes
depleting
them
to
the
point
of
softening
of
the
bones
and
wrecking
the
whole
skeleton
the
endocrines
control
the
transport
and

combinations
and
permutations
in
the
history
of

among
the

are
in
turn

affected

relatively
free
of

liabilities
and
so

by
his
freedom
from
the
recurrent
crises
involving
the
lime
salt
reserve
which
constitute
the
essence
of
the
life
story
of
woman
the
sex
index
it
follows
from
these
considerations
that
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
size
the
sex
composition
of
a
man
or
woman
a
measurement
becomes
establishable
which
may
be
spoken
of
as
the
sex
index
to
be
able
to
say
of
llewylln
jones
that
he
is
sixty
per
cent
masculine
and
forty
per
cent
feminine
or
of
worthington
that
she
is
seventy
per
cent
feminine
and
thirty
per
cent
masculine
would
be
of
the
utmost
value
under
all
kinds
of
circumstances
unfortunately
lacking
as
we
do
the
exact
figures
of
an
advanced
blood
chemistry
yet
in
its
most
infantile
infancy
a
direct
indexing
of
the
sort
is
impossible
but
it
is
certainly
conceivable
along
the
lines
of
measurement
suggested
by
the
binet
tests
and
others
that
a
scale
of
evaluation
of
the
secondary
sex
traits
may
be
elaborated
which
would
turn
out
as
valuable
in
understanding
the
frictions
of
the
individual
and
more
concretely
that
aspect
of
it
to
which
pathologists
of
the
mind
are
tracing
so
much
needless
misery
and
suffering
maladjusted
sexuality
expressed
and
suppressed
nothing
will
contribute
more
to
harmonious
adjustment
for
these
sufferers
than
recognition
of
the
fact
that
we
are
all
more
or
less
partial
hermaphrodites
the
functional
hermaphrodite
the
complete
or
total
hermaphrodite
we
define
as
the
individual
who
possesses
the
reproductive
organs
of
the
male
and
the
female
both
testes
and
ovaries
so
rare
is
such
a
combination
in
man
that
for
a
long
time
its
occurrence
was
doubted
descriptions
of
it
regarded
as
myth
however
undoubted
cases
are
on
record
examined
by
the
most
careful
of
observers
of

mixed
reproductive
organs
strangely
enough
the
history
of
these
cases
shows
that
at
one
time
the
masculine
set
and
at
another
the
feminine
set
will
hold
sway
over
the
sex
traits
and
functions
blending

not

rare
though
the
true
hermaphrodite
may
be
the

frequent

as
the
concomitance
of

traits
or
of

with
masculine

have
been
described
from
time
immemorial
as
freaks

even
more
frequently
is
the
mixed
sex
ensemble
in
which
the
type
of
reproductive

and
of

traits
run
roughly
parallel
emulsified
with
certain

of
the
opposite

the

may
infer
an
education
of

that
has
brought

into

imposed

the

something
that
still
remains
to
be
thoroughly
worked
out
as
a
problem
of
tremendous
importance
particularly
are
the
reactions
of
the
mixed

types
to
be
carefully
considered
for
since
the

is
fundamentally
a

institution
devised
to
satisfy
the
sex
needs
all
the
way
from
companionship
to
parenthood
it
is
apparent
that
the
mixed
sex
types
will
be
tried
the
hardest
by
its
inexorable
conditions
it
is
in
relation
to
the
mother
or
nurse
first
the
father
next
and
other
associates
in
proportion
to
their
proximity
that
the
primary
mechanisms
the
germs
of
the
growing
soul
become
established
these
are
superimposed
upon
the
hereditary
instinct
apparatus
fear
rage
and
love
reactions
develop
first
in
association
with
the
suckling
reflex
and
the
accompaniments
the
mother
smile
and
voice
the
color
of
her
hair
eyes
and
skin
her
breasts
and
odors
each
time
the
babe
reacts
to
a
pleasant
or
unpleasant
stimulus
there
is
an
outpouring
of
certain
internal
secretions
a
cessation
of
others
a
tingling
of
certain
vegetative
nerves
and
organs
a
hushing
of
others
the
ensemble
of
reactions
tends
to
be
repeated
around
the
same
stimulus
until
the
whole
becomes
automatic
one
may
observe
the
same
process
in
the
lower
animals
offer
a
piece
of
meat
to
a
dog
and
his
mouth
waters
ring
a
bell
before
offering
the
meat
repeat
this
a
number
of
times
and
after
a
while
the
mere
ringing
of
the
bell
without
the
presence
of
the
meat
will
cause
his
mouth
to
water
this
associated
vegetative
secretion
reflex
is
the
most
fundamental
to
grasp
in
an
understanding
of
the
deepest
strata
of
personality
now
there
are
besides
the
associated
reactions
certain
inborn
automatic
processes
in
the
vegetative
system
and
in
the
internal
secretion
system
which
work
automatically
to
produce
increased
intravisceral
pressures
the
reduction
of
these
pressures
below
the
point
of
their
intrusion
upon
consciousness
their
relief
as
we
say
also
form
the
centers
of
constellations
around
feelings
of
satisfaction
or
love
such
for
example
are
the
voiding
of
excretions
sooner
or
later
these
automatic
reactions
and
the
associated
reflexes
formed
around
the
mother
father
and
other
associates
come
into
conflict
inhibitions
or
prohibitions
of
the
automatic
act
at
certain
times
or
moments
are
imposed
by
somebody
and
so
there
occurs
a
pitting
of
the
automatic
mechanism
against
the
associated
reflex
conflict
with
adjustment
by
suppression
must
occur
thus
a
sense
of
self
as
active
wisher
for
the
automatically
pleasant
experience
and
punishable
suppressor
of
the
same
in
favor
of
the
acquired
associated
reflex
develops
so
far
so
good
compromise
by
regulation
from
above
from
the
brain
of
the
automatic
reactions
follows
as
training
no
absolute
repression
is
forced
no
absolute
encouragement
is
indorsed
harmonious
equilibrium
or
normality
continues
but
now
there
come
upon
the
scene
the
unconscious
fears
in
the
paleontology
of
character
these
fears
are
the
deepest
strata
the
eocene
era
so
to
speak
of
the
soul
they
are
the
hardest
to
get
at
and
the
most
silent
as
well
as
the
most
dominant
of
the
influences
which
guide
conduct
in
sir
walter
raleigh
words
passions
are
best
likened
to
streams
and
floods
the
shallows
murmur
the
deeps
are
dumb
during
the
first
period
of
childhood
up
to
five
or
six
the
primary
fears
group
themselves
around
the
taboos
and
secrets
of
its
life
though
we
have
every
reason
for
believing
that
the
sex
glands
are
acting
in
some
way
upon
the
organism
during
this
time
nothing
definite
is
known
yet
as
the
numerous
studies
of
the
subconscious
recently
made
prove
sex
curiosity
like
the
other
curiosities
flowers
more
than
about
the
automatic
visceral
reactions
these
curiosities
evoke
the
repressive
imperatives
of
the
associates
the
mother
and
father
especially
these
repressive
influences
may
be
and
often
are
the
effects
of
ignorance
prudishness
vulgarity
or
homosexuality
or
the
sex
perversions
that
are
known
as
sadism
and
masochism
but
by
the
necessities
of
the
case
the
sex
wishes
become
overlayed
by
reflexes
associated
with
the
mother
and
father
and
close
associates
as
love
this
might
be
termed
the
oligocene
as
the
circle
of
acquaintance
widens
other
loved
objects
usher
in
the
miocene
phases
of
the
development
with
these
become
interspersed
various
hates
and
detestations
deliberately
cultivated
and
accepted
by
the
consciousness
so
we
have
a
of
the
personality
in
the
first
five
or
six
years
of
childhood
but
now
with
the
onset
of
the
second
dentition
a
subtle
change
begins
in
the
endocrine
equations
of
the
body
the
second
dentition
itself
is
an
expression
of
a
certain
internal
secretion
wave
passing
through
the
cells
an
increase
of
action
of
some
hormones
a
decrease
of
others
and
a
consciousness
of
physical
sexuality
appears
while
the
outlines
of
character
hitherto
mere
tracings
become
firmer
heavier
lines
that
there
is
some
activity
on
the
part
of
the
internal
secretions
of
the
sex
glands
the
ovaries
and
testes
can
be
demonstrated
by
accurately
charting
the
behaviour
of
a
boy
or
girl
after
this
time
it
will
be
found
that
there
is
a
cyclic
variation
of
health
and
conduct
more
or
less
marked
of
course
in
each
case
a
cold
may
appear
periodically
at
the
end
of
each
month
an
increase
of
irritability
and
waywardness
may
be
observed
or
on
the
contrary
a
decrease
of
the
regular
restless
playfulness
the
ghost
of
sex
begins
to
haunt
the
scene
now
all
kinds
of
possibilities
of
conflict
emerge
the
child
is
still
a
bisexual
growing
into
a
mixed
sex
type
depending
upon
the
nature
and
amount
of
its
internal
secretions
the
influencing
adult
of
the
family
the
most
important
of
the
external
factors
encouraging
or
depressing
the
tendencies
of
the
child
possesses
a
fairly
fixed
ideal
of
monosexuality
which
he
or
she
generally
quite
unconsciously
seeks
to
impose
upon
it
a
doting
feminine
mother
will
make
her
son
as
much
as
possible
like
her
husband
if
she
dislikes
her
husband
as
much
as
possible
like
her
father
or
grandfather
a
masculinized
mother
will
tend
to
make
a
sex
object
out
of
the
son
however
which
means
his
feminization
but
on
the
internal
secretion
side
the
boy
may
be
definitely
masculine
that
is
after
adolescence
he
would
be
strongly
masculine
the
mechanisms
created
by
the
mother
personality
had
not
slipped
into
the
inside
so
to
speak
as
a
consequence
continual
subconscious
conflict
between
the
two
sets
of
sex
reaction
will
sooner
or
later
disturb
perhaps
disrupt
and
ruin
his
life
so
an
infant
may
start
life
with
a
fairly
balanced
endocrine
equipment
with
its
wake
of
a
normal
life
barring
accidents
and
infections
and
yet
he
may
end
as
an
inferior
insane
criminal
or
failure
directly
because
of
establishment
of
conflict
between
himself
as
one
sort
of
sex
type
and
his
obligatory
associates
of
another
sort
of
mixed
sex
type
this
applies
also
to
the
the
and
the
relationship
male
and
female
created
he
them
is
a
bald
misstatement
of
the
facts
male
and
female
emerge
as
final
of
endocrine
heredity
environmental
treatment
and
adaptation
often
the

persist
anatomically
or
are
forced
to
persist
functionally
society
constructed
upon
the
biblical
dogmas
of
man
as
a
fallen
angel
and
absolute
sex
is
responsible
for
much
misery
and
suffering
meted
out
to
the
functional
hermaphrodite
as
we
shall
see
later
in
an
analysis
of
the
endocrine
character
of
oscar
wilde
the
privileges
and
powers
of

relationship
marriage
and
parenthood
should
be
safeguarded
for
the
mixed

type
the
man
or
woman
with
the
variable
sex
index
for
there
are
no
tragedies
in
life
more
pitiful
than
those
in
which
an
aggressive
masculinely
built
type
is
forced
to
assume
a
submissive
receptive
passive
feminine
rôle
and
vice
versa
the
tragedy
of
compelled
homosexuality
because
of
wrong
associates
masochism
and
sadism
the
functional
hermaphrodite
enables
us
too
to
understand
the
phenomena
of
masochism
and
sadism
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
chemical
side
the
masculine
personality
the
combination
of
masculine
adrenal
cortex
and
gonad
internal

predominance
is
built
for
aggression
the
feminine
personality
the
union
of
feminine
thyroid
and
ovarian
superiority
is
constructed
for
submission
reverse
the
possibilities
or
confuse
them
as
occurs
in
the
functional
hermaphrodite
and
the
attitudes
become
reversed
or
perverted
so
a
masculinoid
personality
in
woman
will
make
for
sadism
a
feminoid
personality
in
a
man
for
masochism
variants
and
refinements
of
these
perversions
will
often
be
found
in
the
functional
hermaphrodite
who
must
satisfy
two
doubly
flowing
streams
of
visceral
pressure
within
himself
persistence
of
the
thymus
or
pineal
gland
tends
to
a
prolongation
of
the
infantile

types
that
will
be
taken
advantage

the

if

permits

amazing

a

so
likewise
the

essentially
the

all

the

of
the

in
the

mixture
which
is

marvelous
are
all
the
manifestations
of
the
reproductive
necessity
considering
that
reproduction
was
at

merely
a
form
of
growth
a
discontinuous
kind
of
growth
that
seized
upon
sex
as
a
splendid
means
to
escape
death
the
chemical

evolved
arouse
a
sense
of

a

practically

him
as
the

a

keep

unsexed
then
at

a
new

is
added
to
the
calmly
flowing
river
and
behold
a

ovaries

actively
functioning
erupt
upon
the
calm

and
the

is
transfigured
into

after

the

after
the

the

after
that
the

and
the

besides
all
the
other

the

or

completely
innumerable
varieties

action
supply
us
with
the
limitless
types
of
adolescent

some
endocrine

that
make
one

stable

make
others
unstable

so

only
to
bring

the
internal

of
the

or
to
suppress
and
distort
and
so
spoil
her
adolescence
will
be
peaceful

according

so
continued
happiness

disharmony
ailments
unhappiness
difficulties
mean

they

or
are
acting
as
marauders
the
after
life
sexually
the
period
of
maturity
barring
accidents
diseases
and
shocks
will
bear
the
same
character
the
kind
of
adolescence
provides
the
clue
to
the
kind
of
maturity
for
both
are
effects
of
the
same
endocrine
factors
the
sex
gland
chain
furthermore
the
activities
of
a
normal
woman
involve
a
series
of
sex
glands
since
there
function
in
addition
to
the
ovaries
the
glands
of
the
uterus
the
breasts
or
mammary
glands
and
the
placental
gland
the
secreting
cells
of
the
tissue
which
comes
out
as
the
each
of
these
contributes
directly
to
the
reproductive
life
of
the
individual
to
call
the
ova
the
sex
glands
is
to
confer
upon
them
a
name
which
really
belongs
to
a
chain
of
glands
all
of
the
members
of
the
sex
chain
including
those
of
the
thyroid
the
adrenal
and
the
pituitary
are
necessary
to
the
functions
of
menstruation
impregnation
settlement
of
fertilized
ovum
in
the
wall
of
the
uterus
labor
and
lactation
a
disturbance
of
one
of
them
will
set
up
disturbances
all
along
the
line
and
a
resonance
of
distress
or
compensation
upon
the
part
of
all
of
them
as
an
interlocking
directorate
over
the
sexual
functions
of
the
female
they
are
members
one
of
the
other
so
what
helps
or
hurts
one
helps
or
hurts
all
the
cycle
of
menstruation
essentially
the
ovary
is
a
collection
of
follicles
nests
of
cells
acting
as
safe
deposit
vaults
for
the
ova
that
are
to
become
candidates
for
fertilization
at
birth
there
are
some
to
of
these
of
which
a
good
many
atrophy
during
childhood
so
that
there
are
no
more
than
about
left
at
puberty
of
the
only
an
élite
actually
mature
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
about
every
days
one
of
the
follicles
swells
becomes
filled
with
liquid
pushes
or
is
pushed
to
the
surface
of
the
ovary
there
to
rupture
and
expel
into
the
abdominal
cavity
the
tiny
ripe
ovum
the
rest
of
the
torn
follicle
makes
itself
over
into
a
peculiar
yellowish
body
the
true
corpus
luteum
should
pregnancy
occur
if
pregnancy
and
the
consequent
placenta
do
not
occur
it
shrinks
and
turns
into
a
scar
the
false
corpus
luteum
the
true
corpus
luteum
resembles
closely
the
adrenal
cortex
in
and
staining
reactions
it
seems
as
if
once
successful
impregnation
has
been
achieved
the
feminine
organism
adrenalizes
itself
makes
itself
more
masculine
and
less
feminine
inhibiting
the
posterior
pituitary
and
the
adrenal
medulla
as
well
as
the
ovaries
besides
the
corpus
luteum
stimulates
the
thyroid
to
prepare
for
the
heavy
demands
to
be
made
upon
it
during
pregnancy
before
menstruation
there
is
a
stage
of
preparation
a
stir
and
twittering
of
the
endocrines
the
premenstrual
state
currents
of
communication
flow
between
the
different
glands
messages
and
replies
pass
to
and
fro
when
these
are
properly
balanced
so
that
all
goes
well
the
consciousness
of
the
woman
will
be
disturbed
by
no
knowledge
of
them
in
some
women
abnormal
sensations
appear
a
sense
of
fullness
in
the
breasts
or
of
weight
in
the
back
or
pelvis
or
pain
in
the
head
the
last
is
probably
due
to
swelling
of
the
pituitary
beyond
the
capacity
of
its
bony
container
in
a
good
many
women
nervous
and
mental
phenomena
herald
the
expected
menstruation
because
of
a
complete
upset
of
the
balance
between
the
internal
secretions
with
resulting
disturbance
of
the
nervous
system
irritability
depression
excitability
melancholia
exaltations
restlessness
hysteria
loss
of
or
even
more
marked
mental
aberrations
may
appear
following
them
and
roughly
paralleling
them
may
come
various
abnormalities
of
menstruation
itself
the
character
extent
and
duration
of
these
furnish
us
the
best
clues
to
the
endocrine
stability
or
instability
of
the
particular
feminine
organism
menstruation
is
simply
the
uterus
saying
well
not
this

the

its

the

its

safety
for
its

but
it
is
not
to
be
no

or
effective
enough
to
penetrate
that
wandering
ovum
labour
lost
all
must
return
to
the
normal
really
the
intermenstrual
state
the

must
surrender
some
of
that

the

return
to
their
routine
and
a
sex
diastole
of
the
whole

succeeds
until
again
another

swells
another
ovum
matures
and
the
premenstrual
state
of
sex
high
tide
cycles
back
seven
to
ten
days
before
menstruation
we
know
that
sex
high
tide
is
beginning
for
that
is
when
the
blood
pressure
goes
up
as
this
rise
of
blood
pressure
is
probably
controlled
by
the
posterior
pituitary
we
have
a
clue
to
the
reason
for
the
rhythmic
variations
in
the
rate
of
production
of
its
secretion
by
the
ovary
for
since
menstruation
is
so
closely
connected
with
the
phases
of
the
moon
and
the
tides
the
rhythmicity
of
the
posterior
pituitary
may
be
traced
to
the
days
when
the
pineal
was
an
eye
at
the
top
of
the
head
and
in
direct
relation
with
the
pituitary
menstruation
has
been
said
to
be
a
miniature
labor
it
is
not
that
as
much
as
it
is
a
miniature
abortion
it
is
an
effort
of
nature
but
nature
is
quite
used
to
its
disappointments
and
returns
placidly
to
the
daily
grind
the
four
phases
of
a
day
cycle
succeed
each
other
as
the
premenstrual
the
menstrual
the
postmenstrual
and
the
intermenstrual
with
the
precision
of
pistons
moving
in
a
motor
when
no
interfering
factor
as
disease
profound
emotion
or
climate
disturbances
are
present
affecting
the
endocrines
the
sequence
of
events
appears
to
be
about
as
follows
the
amount
of
secretion
reaches
a
certain
concentration
this
in
turn
stimulates
the
thyroid
and
adrenal
medulla
they
in
turn
activate
the
ovarian
cells
which
congest
the
uterine
glands
and
lining
membrane
the
follicle
bursts
the
ovum
is
discharged
and
wanders
the
uterus
waits
and
wonders
nothing
happens
the
curtain
is
lowered
the
scenery
is
removed
the
actors
revert
to
civilian
clothes
that
is
the
story
of
menstruation
the
central
phenomenon
of
woman
life
one
sees
it
clearly
as
a
play
of
an
internal
secretion
syndicate
the
premenstrual
molimina
the
premenstrual
molimina
is
the
traditional
title
accorded
symptoms
sensations
feelings
observations
of
women
in
the
premenstrual
phase
in
the
light
of
endocrine
analysis
they
become
exceedingly
important
indicators
of
the
underlying
constitution
of
the
individual
concerned
indeed
the
premenstrual
period
furnishes
a
direct
clue
to
the
dominating
internal
secretion
in
a
woman
moreover
these
premenstrual
phenomena
are
the
shadows
cast
by
coming
events
for
they
mimic
and
prophesy
the
events
of
the
last
crisis
of
feminine
sex
life
the
cessation
of
ovulation
which
goes
by
the
name
of
menopause
gonadopause
or
change
of
sex
life
the
premenstrual
phenomena
provide
a
positive
film
so
to
speak
of
the
latent
negative
picture
of
the
endocrine
system
of
the
girl
or
woman
thus
there
is
the
or
pituitary
insufficient
type
in
whom
the
excessive
swelling
of
the
gland
causes
headache
and
a
dull
heavy
tired
feeling
a
definite
depression
drowsiness
sleepishness
indifference
to
surroundings
general
sluggishness
of
thought
feeling
and
reaction
a
phlegmatic
frilosity
all
go
with
it
it
is
due
to
an
overweighing
of
the
pituitary
controller
of
good
brain
tone
and
alive
wakefulness
by
the
demands
of
the
organism
on
the
other
hand
the
hyperthyroid
type
of
woman
reacts
with
an
exaggeration
of
her
tendency
when
the
posterior
pituitary
begins
to
secrete
more
in
her
its
stimulation
of
the
thyroid
is
enough
to
tip
it
over
the
normal
line
such
a
woman
in
the
premenstrual
phase
becomes
irritable
and
restless
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
can
not
concentrate
on
conversation
occupation
or
any
single
activity
may
become
excited
to
the
point
of
mania
hot
tremulous
sleepless
or
sleeping
badly
she
has
a
much
harder
time
of
it
than
her
pituitary
sister
these
samples
of
premenstrual
internal
secretion
reaction
are
the
extremes
of
a
vast
number
and
variety
of
types
there
are
women
in
an
unstable
state
for
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
sometimes
an
infectious
disease
or
a
psychic
blow
will
put
a
woman
into
this
class
the
significance
of
these
cyclic
changes
has
been
tremendously
increased
by
the
recent
formal
admission
of
women
to
participation
in
public
activities
on
a
plane
of
equality
with
men
evidence
exists
that
in
man
too
there
is
some
cyclic
rhythmicity
of
his
endocrines
which
sets
up
a
fluctuation
in
his
physical
and
mental
efficiency
the
curves
of
these
variations
have
still
to
be
plotted
and
will
doubtless
contribute
no
little
to
our
knowledge
of
the
control
of
human
nature
one
unexpurgated
fact
stands
out
the
reproductive
mechanism
of
woman
has
rendered
her
whole
internal
secretion
system
and
so
her
nervous
system
all
her
organs
her
mind
definitely
and
sharply
more
tidal
in
their
currents
more
zigzag
in
their
phases
more
angular
in
their
ups
and
downs
of
function
and
so
less
predictable
reliable
and
dependable
the
masculinoid
woman
the
masculinoid
woman
as
a
functional
hermaphrodite
exists
first
as
a
congenital
entity
with
an
inborn
distribution
of
endocrine
predominances
that
make
for
masculinity
there
are
also
numerous
acquired
forms
the
infections
of
childhood
measles
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
and
above
all
mumps
may
so
damage
the
hormone
system
that
an
inversion
of
sex
type
follows
however
the
stimulative
and
depressive
effects
of
environment
are
even
more
significant
the
effects
of
environment
in
producing
changes
in
an
organism
the
changes
the
biologist
sums
up
as
adaptation
can
be
tracked
in
many
instances
to
responsive
reactions
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
to
demands
made
upon
them
by
changed
external
conditions
so
a
cold
climate
which
necessitates
a
more
voluminous
hair
covering
for
an
animal
will
evoke
a
hypertrophy
of
the
adrenal
cortex
secondarily
other
effects
appear
as
of
the
adaptation
the
adrenal
cortex
makes
for
pugnacity
temper
animal
courage
irritability
and
anger
reactions
so
a
hairy
animal
will
in
general
unless
other
endocrines
come
in
to
defeat
the
primary
effect
be
more
pugnacious
courageous
irritable
and
combative
the
same
applies
to
woman
an
environment
which
tends
to
encourage
the
masculine
traits
in
her
to
arouse
repeatedly
her
pugnacity
and
combative
decisions
in
the
more
rapid
give
and
take
of
the
masculine
world
will
rouse
the
adrenal
cortex
to
greater
activity
and
so
make
her
face
hirsute
her
attitudes
aggressive
and
perhaps
render
her
sterile
concomitantly
there
may
be
a
disturbance
of
menstruation
the
presence
or
absence
of
sterility
natural
or
enforced
always
present
or
say
appearing
after
the
birth
of
one
child
must
all
be
donated
a
prominent
place
in
studying
the
endocrine
of
a
woman
when
there
is
not
enough
ovarian
secretion
the
ovum
may
not
be
able
to
burst
through
the
ovary
a
necessity
before
it
may
begin
its
travels
to
the
uterus
next
the
propulsive
action
of
the
genital
ducts
may
be
insufficient
because
of
defective
corpus
luteum
or
the
uterus
may
not
have
received
enough
posterior
pituitary
or
thyroid
to
make
it
fit
soil
for
the
ovum
to
plant
itself
in
or
there
may
be
too
much
of
these
which
cause
the
uterus
to
massage
itself
daily
by
gentle
contractions
and
so
keep
it
excessive
massage
will
throw
the
ovum
out
all
these
are
factors
in
the
sterility
problem
with
its
psychic
resonances
affecting
the
maternal
instinct
the
maternal
instinct
there
have
been
created
high
odes
to
an
unknown
god
sensuous
lyrics
of
love
apostrophes
and
addresses
to
every
human
passion
but
no
poet
to
my
knowledge
has
risen
to
the
heights
of
the
maternal
instinct
some
contemporary
about
sentimentalism
will
perhaps
decry
and
ridicule
the
demand
for
an
apotheosis
of
it
there
are
some
who
deny
its
existence
and
assert
that
maternity
is
forced
upon
every
woman
reduced
to
its
elements
such
nonsense
turns
out
the
absurd
pose
of
the
theorist
desperate
to
épater
le
bourgeois
or
to
cover
up
hidden
defects
in
his
or
her
without
the
maternal
instinct
without
the
hope
of
immortality
through
somatic
or
spiritual
posterity
we
should
all
who
were
sane
enough
have
to
condemn
ourselves
to
the
futilities
of
hedonism
so
that
the
criminal
who
was
condemned
to
roll
a
huge
boulder
up
a
hill
only
to
see
it
roll
down
again
would
have
to
thank
his
lucky
stars
for
his
lighter
punishment
the
future
tomorrow
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
earth
or
if
you
will
the
republic
of
supermen
means
to
all
of
us
what
the
child
means
to
the
madonna
the
cynical
epicurean
careerists
and
careeristinas
and
the
depraved
degenerates
of
a
civilization
may
have
suffered
an
absolute
atrophy
and
castration
of
that
instinct
but
they
are
pathologic
specimens
and
we
are
not
for
the
moment
concerned
with
them
the
freudians
have
set
up
a
great
hullaballoo
about
creative
activities
as
sublimations
of
the
sex
instinct
or
as
they
would
have
it
the
libido
that
is
their
obsession
the
confusion
of
the
sex
instinct
the
instinct
for
sex
life
and
satisfaction
in
the
relation
of
the
male
to
the
female
with
the
maternal
instinct
the
paternal
instinct
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
maternal
as
the
breasts
of
the
male
do
to
those
of
the
female
a
functional
hermaphrodite
trait
the
maternal
instinct
is
the
instinct
to
create
provide
and
care
for
offspring
the
mother
expresses
the
deep
craving
of
protoplasm
for
immortality
what
drives
her
is
the
instinct
of
life
to
preserve
itself
unto
eternity
in
infinite
space
and
time
that
separates
it
sharply
from
the
temporary
needs
of
the
sex
instinct
the
artist
the
man
of
science
or
letters
the
statesman
craftsman
and
maker
of
every
sort
is
instigated
by
the
maternal
instinct
he
creates
for
his
own
pleasure
to
be
sure
but
it
is
in
its
essence
the
pleasure
of
the
bird
making
its
nest
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
distinguish
between
the
sex
instinct
and
the
maternal
instinct
for
different
glands
of
internal
secretion
have
been
found
responsible
for
them
a
distinct
difference
in
the
quality
and
amount
of
the
two
instincts
may
be
observed
in
the
same
person
a
strong
maternal
instinct
may
be
seen
again
and
again
to
dominate
a
woman
with
but
little
or
no
sex
urge
or
passion
numerous
physiologically
frigid
women
have
lived
successful
and
happy
married
lives
because
of
contented
maternity
other
women
with
normal
or
exaggerated
sex
instinct
who
welcome
and
stimulate
the
sex
life
may
have
no
wish
for
children
no
functioning
maternal
instinct
at
all
and
if
sterile
will
accept
their
fate
with
indifference
or
even
exultation
these
variations
occur
because
of
a
difference
in
chemical
source
and
determination
of
the
two
instincts
while
the
ovary
stimulated
by
the
thyroid
and
the
adrenal
medulla
is
the
chief
determinant
of
the
sex
instinct
to
the
posterior
pituitary
must
be
credited
the
chief
hormone
of
the
maternal
instinct
the
interactions
of
the
two
glands
the
ovary
and
the
posterior
pituitary
modified
by
accessory
influences
determine
the
relative
intensity
of
the
two
instincts
in
a
sense
the
two
glands
may
be
said
to
be
antagonistic
and
yet
one
stimulates
and
complements
the
other
the
transfigurations
of
though
what
happens
at
puberty
what
happens
all
through
life
through
the
agencies
of
the
endocrines
is
amazing
enough
what
occurs
during
the
period
of
is
perhaps
the
most
amazing
of
all
as
emphasized
pregnancy
is
the
time
among
the
internal
secretions
of
a
great
uprooting
and
stirring
of
fundamental
and
cataclysmic
changes
in
the
most
intimate
chemistry
of
the
cells
it
is
as
if
a
dictator
inspired
by
his
country
danger
its
enemies
at
the
gates
of
its
capitol
were
to
draft
and
mobilize
everyone
man
woman
and
child
from
everyday
activities
to
the
necessities
of
defense
or
rather
it
is
as
if
there
appeared
within
the
heart
of
our
civilization
a
common
purpose
and
intelligence
now
so
palpably
lacking
which
magnetized
and
drew
to
itself
all
the
streams
of
individual
effort
imagine
that
possibility
and
how
it
would
change
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
entire
basic
constitution
of
human
life
and
society
so
do
the
profound
tides
of
the
hormones
centering
around
the
new
creature
being
made
in
the
womb
transfigure
the
face
and
constitution
of
the
woman
during

in
consequence
the
integrity
of
every
structure
of
the
body
is
tested
a
stern
relentless

up

the
best
novel
ever
made
about
america
as
a
nation
of

the
heroine
carol
kennicott
has
this
to
say
to
someone
sentimentalizing
about
maternity
i
do
not
look
lovely
bogar
my
complexion
is
rotten
and
my
hair
is
coming
out
and
i
look
like
a
potato
bag
and
i
think
my
arches
are
falling
and
the
whole
business
is
a
confounded
nuisance
of
a
biological
process
the
exploration
of
the
internal
secretions
has
brought
us
an
explanation
and
an
understanding
of
why
is
a
nuisance
we
know
now
that
if
carol
kennicott
complexion
became
rotten
and
her
hair
fell
out
it
was
because
her
thyroid
was
not
adequate
to
the
demands
of
pregnancy
and
that
if
her
arches
were
falling
and
her
figure
acquiring
a
potato
bag
dumpiness
it
was
because
her
pituitary
was
insufficient
in
all
probability
she
was
a
type
which
accounts
for
much
of
the
material
that
goes
to
make
up
the
novel
different
endocrine
types
react
characteristically
toward
the
situations
of
pregnancy
the
adrenal
type
may
not
be
able
to
respond
with
the
necessary
enlargement
of
its
cortex
which
is
normal
for
the
needs
of
gestation
so
pigmentations
darkenings
and
discolorations
of
the
skin
especially
of
the
face
the
traditional
chloasma
develops
the
hyperthyroid
type
may
become
sharply
exaggerated
almost
to
the
point
of
mania
and
psychosis
the
subthyroid
will
suffer
an
emphasis
of
her
defect
and
pass
on
because
of
pregnancy
to
the
truly
diseased
state
of
myxedema
the
state
of
dull
slow
stupid
the
pituitary
type
becomes
more
masculinized
the

more
triangular

coarser
the

there
is

that

is
seen
to
grow
visibly
in

and
in
the
size
of
the

concomitantly
there
is
a
changed
a
more
matured

steadier
outlook
upon

all
due
to

analysis
of
the
transfigurations
of
born
with
the
pregnancy
its
life
is
terminated
with
the
pregnancy
for
it
is
expelled
in
labor
as
the
its
importance
and
function
as
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
has
become
known
only
recently
many
still
doubt
and
question
the
accordance
of
that
rank
to
it
but
feeding
experiments
with
it
in
various
endocrine
disturbances
in
human
beings
have
proved
its
right
to
the
title
the
placenta
is
created
by
the
fusion
of
the
topmost
enlarged
cells
of
the
uterine
surface
and
the
most
advanced
cells
constituting
the
vanguard
of
the
growing
and
multiplying
ovum
these
front
line
invaders
interact
with
the
cells
in
contact
with
them
to
make
a
new
organ
which
serves
as
lung
stomach
and
kidney
for
the
embryo
since
it
is
the
medium
of
exchange
of
oxygen
foodstuffs
and
waste
products
between
the
blood
of
the
mother
and
the
blood
of
the
embryo
ultimately
it
acts
too
as
a
gland
of
internal
secretion
influencing
the
internal
secretions
of
the
mother
and
also
those
of
the
embryo
settlement
of
the
fertilized
ovum
in
the
womb
introduces
into
the
system
new
secretions
new
substances
which
are
partly
male
in
origin
since
the
ovum
contains
within
it
the
substance
of
the
male
sperm
which
has
penetrated
it
this
masculine
element
causes
a
rearrangement
of
the
balance
of
power
between
the
endocrines
towards
the
side
of
masculinity
they
push
down
the
pan
of
the
scale
to
inhibit
the
so
menstruation
the
menstrual
wave
which
follows
the
increasing
tide
of
secretion
is
postponed
for
ten
lunar
months
not
another
ovum
breaks
through
the
covering
of
the
ovary
and
the
uterus
is
left
undisturbed
the
placental
secretion
plays
a
most
important
rôle
as
brake
upon
the
the
most
active
of
the
feminizing
endocrines
until
at
last
something
happens
that
puts
the
placenta
out
of
commission
in
this
function
of
restraint
and
the
long
bottled
up
secretion
explodes
the
crisis
apparent
as
the
process
of
labor
a
condition
of
often
occurs
in
pregnancy
with
symptoms
orchestrating
from
mild
notes
like
nausea
and
vomiting
to
the
high
keys
of
convulsions
and
insanities
they
represent
what
happens
when
an
unbalanced
endocrine
system
is
attacked
by
the
placenta
depending
upon
where
in
the
internal
secretion
chain
the
weak
point
the
achilles
heel
spot
will
be
found
the
nature
of
the
reaction
will
vary
and
even
after
labor
after
the
explosive
crisis
so
much
of
the
reserve
endocrine
materials
may
be
consumed
that
an
actual
mania
or
a
chronic
weakness
may
come
in
its
wake
yet
the
placental
secretion
must
not
be
looked
upon
as
something
wholly
evil
in
its
potentialities
without
enough
of
it
to
hold
the
uterus
stimulating
endocrines
particularly
the
in
check
results
if
there
is
enough
and
not
too
much
of
it
the
woman
will
not
feel
ill
at
all
or
perhaps
only
transiently
but
will
be
possessed
of
a
curious
feeling
of
drowsy
content
and
passive
relaxed
happiness
let
there
be
relatively
too
much
of
it
too
little
of
the
other
glands
and
the
grosser
transfigurations
and
ailments
of
the
period
follow
the
mammary
glands
once
pregnancy
is
terminated
by
labor
the
placenta
is
expelled
from
the
body
as
the
the
placenta
removed
a
new
arrangement
of
the
balance
of
power
among
the
endocrines
becomes
necessary
but
a
appears
upon
the
scene
to
take
up
the
function
left
vacant
by
the
absent
placenta
this
is
the
secretion
of
the
activated
breasts
the
mammary
glands
they
make
for
a
persistence
of
the
state
of
equilibrium
among
the
endocrines
attained
during
pregnancy
the
mammary
glands
are
typical
glands
of
external
secretion
they
make
the
milk
and
pour
it
out
of
the
breasts
through
little
canals
into
the
mouth
of
the
suckling
yet
evidence
forces
us
to
conclude
that
they
are
also
glands
of
internal
secretion
that
their
internal
secretion
substitutes
to
a
certain
extent
for
the
loss
of
that
of
the
placenta
but
not
quite
what
seems
to
happen
in
fact
is
this
the
corpus
luteum
secretion
stimulates
the
dormant
cells
of
the
mammary
glands
formed
during
puberty
but
latent
until
the
advent
of
pregnancy
we
know
that
injection
of
corpus
luteum
will
cause
an
hypertrophy
of
the
breasts
the
same
effect
is
produced
regularly
during
the
menstrual
period
with
a
consciousness
of
swelling
of
the
breasts
their
atrophy
at
the
menopause
coincides
with
the
shrinkage
of
the
ovaries
that
takes
place
at
that
period
activity
of
the
breasts
parallels
indeed
more
or
less
the
activity
of
the
corpus
luteum
with
the
prolonged
activity
of
the
corpus
luteum
during
pregnancy
prolonged
stimulation
of
the
breasts
occurs
the
secretion
of
the
would
now
cause
the
change
from
the
internal
cell
secretion
to
milk
but
it
is
inhibited
from
so
doing
by
the
placenta
when
the
placenta
is
removed
after
labor
the
can
act
and
a
free
flow
of
milk
is
established
however
to
counterbalance
this
and
to
prevent
the
from
overacting
the
breasts
secrete
a
hormone
with
an
action
like
that
of
placenta
but
not
so
strong
which
tends
to
inhibit
the
ovary
so
is
put
off
the
imposition
of
a
pregnancy
upon
a
period
of
lactation
obviously
bad
for
mother
infant
and
embryo
we
have
here
an
exquisite
sample
of
the
checks
and
compensations
which
make
for
a
of
the
whole
endocrine
system
critical
ages
the
dangerous
age
is
a
phrase
coined
by
a
scandinavian
writer
as
a
more
dramatic
euphemism
for
the
time
of
life
when
sex
function
ceases
the
climacteric
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
age
of
adolescence
is
just
as
much
of
a
dangerous
age
as
the
age
of
deliquescence
the
only
difference
between
them
is
that
the
dangers
of
the
one
have
been
hushed
up
the
dangers
of
the
other
well
boomed
and
advertised
both
are
dangerous
to
the
individual
because
both
are
periods
of
instability
and
readjustment
of
the
cells
particularly
the
brain
cells
to
a
deranged
endocrine
system
and
blood
chemistry
moral
attitudes
differ
at
the
two
ages
not
so
much
as
an
effect
of
experience
as
expressions
of
different
visceral
pressures
produced
by
newly
dominant
internal
secretions
so
in
eugene
play
we
see
the
woman
emma
crosby
as
she
is
in
her
youth
when
her
ovaries
have
budded
and
bloomed
for
only
a
few
years
and
her
other
endocrine
influences
are
still
dormant
she
breaks
off
her
engagement
to
captain
caleb
williams
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
because
she
is
informed
of
the
episodes
of
a
sex
affair
he
was
involved
in
on
his
last
voyage
under
circumstances
not
discreditable
to
him
the
next
act
shows
her
thirty
years
later
when
as
an
elderly
spinster
she
is
passing
through
the
climacteric
and
is
in
the
state
of
sexual
hyperesthesia
some
women
are
afflicted
with
before
the
menopause
it
is
as
if
the
ovaries
and
the
accessory
sex
internal
secretions
erupt
into
a
sort
of
final
geyser
before
they
are
exhausted
so
the
captain
ever
faithful
finds
her
and
discovers
to
his
horror
that
she
is
a
thousand
times
more
like
other
women
than
he
has
ever
been
like
other
men
because
of
his
ignorance
of
the
underlying
chemical
basis
for
the
transfiguration
tragedy
follows
critics
may
cackle
about
a
sex
starved
woman
who
has
repressed
her
natural
desires
and
hail
the
play
as
a
contribution
to
the
freudian
clinics
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
study
of
libido
variation
with
endocrine
variation
at
two
stages
of
the
inner
chemical
life
of
a
woman
the
chain
of
events
at
the
menopause
the
acme
and
then
ebb
of
the
sex
tide
may
be
summed
up
something
like
this
the
ovaries
cease
producing
their
eggs
and
so
shrivel
as
a
storage
battery
atrophies
when
it
dries
up
an
important
member
of
the
endocrine
board
of
directors
thus
drops
out
and
so
a
rearrangement
of
gland
activities
a
new
régime
becomes
necessary
if
a
balance
of
power
is
established
quickly
and
equitably
very
little
happens
quickly
the
woman
passes
on
to
the
next
plane
of
her
existence
but
if
some
endocrine
proves
recalcitrant
and
takes
advantage
of
the
situation
to
make
itself
dominant
trouble
and
maladjustment
and
their
psychic
echoes
come
anterior
pituitary
control
will
mean
a
relative
masculinization
with
hair
on
the
face
and
aggressive
attitudes
most
often
refuses
to
settle
down
and
expressing
its
ambition
as
headaches
flushes
obesity
and
hysteria
may
cause
extreme
misery
and
unhappiness
to
its
possessor
sooner
or
later
if
the
harmonious
equilibrium
of
the
normal
life
is
to
be
revived
all
the
glands
must
regress
thyroid
pituitary
and
adrenals
with
the
waning
of
the
ovarian
function
the
thyroid
type
will
also
exhibit
its
particular
flare
if
there
is
thyroid
excess
the
woman
will
be
excitable
and
irritable
the
thyroid
deficient
will
be
depressed
and
dull
the
thyroid
unstable
that
is
swinging
between
excess
and
deficiency
will
have
a
cyclic
up
and
down
alternation
of
mood
and
temperament
the
adrenal
centered
will
have
a
high
blood
pressure
and
masculinoid
traits
the
adrenal
inferior
will
have
a
low
blood
pressure
and
suffer
from
a
constant
weakness
and
fatigability
so
each
form
of
reaction
to
the
critical
ages
is
individualized
according
to
the
predominating
glandular
influence
in
the
constitution
of
the
woman
when
the
womb
has
atrophied
and
the
breasts
have
shrunk
the
typical
tan
complexion
and
the
angular
masculinoid
figure
face
and
psyche
follow
and
the
transfiguration
has
been
completed
man
has
his
critical
age
of
sex
cell
deterioration
as
well
as
woman
the
age
period
swings
between
and
here
enters
upon
the
scene
that
organ
of
external
and
internal
secretion
the
prostate
the
most
important
of
the
accessory
sex
glands
in
the
male
experiments
with
its
extract
upon
growing
tadpoles
have
demonstrated
it
to
have
the
same
differentiating
effects
as
thyroid
but
without
the
poisoning
effects
furthermore
the
microscope
reveals
cyclic
changes
in
its
cells
comparable
to
the
menstrual
phenomena
of
the
uterus
indeed
it
is
accepted
as
the
homologue
or
male
representative
of
the
uterus
small
and
undeveloped
during
childhood
its
growth
at
puberty
parallels
that
of
the
other
reproductive
organs
its
secretion
has
been
shown
to
be
necessary
to
the
vitality
of
the
sperm
cells
the
regression
of
the
prostate
its
retirement
from
the
field
of
sex
competition
is
the
central
episode
of
the
male
climacteric
accompanying
its
shrinking
are
prominent
an
irritable
weakness
despondency
and
melancholia
which
may
emerge
at
any
time
if
there
is
disease
or
disturbance
of
it
the
influence
of
the
prostate
upon
mental
condition
and
its
contribution
to
the
sex
index
still
remains
to
be
investigated
in
detail
sex
crises
at
the
periods
of
interstitial
cell
hyperactivity
when
a
wave
of
radicalism
in
the
blood
sweeps
through
the
tissues
the
other
endocrines
are
tested
and
their
latent
stability
or
instability
is
made
manifest
even
before
puberty
cyclic
variations
of
health
and
conduct
may
be
observed
in
boys
and
girls
which
undoubtedly
depend
upon
currents
among
the
internal
secretions
children
who
in
the
best
of
circumstances
habitually
are
attacked
by
a
wanderlust
and
run
away
from
home
or
suffer
from
fits
of
naughtiness
are
samples
of
such
endocrine
lability
children
specialists
have
found
that
at
about
the
end
of
the
second
year
their
charges
begin
to
individuate
in
a
certain
percentage
sex
traits
appear
pretty
early
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
is
rather
the
minority
of
girls
who
spontaneously
exhibit
the
traditional
stigmata
of
the
natural
girl
the
housekeeping
imitator
of
mother
is
another
story
at
puberty
arise
the
most
exquisite
cases
of
life
crisis
dependent
upon
hormonic
crisis
the
boy
becomes
restless
irritable
and
when
his
thyroid
and
adrenals
respond
to
the
call
of
the
interstitial
cells
if
they
do
not
he
will
become
dull
heavy
lazy
and
listless
the
girl
correspondingly
is
transformed
into
a
vivacious
gay
nervous
and
apprehensive
butterfly
or
a
sedate
dreamy
bashful
or
even
morose
moth
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
poise
mental
equilibrium
is
not
established
until
physical
growth
ceases
marked
by
a
cessation
of
growth
of
the
long
bones
known
as
ossification
of
the
epiphyses
poise
seems
to
be
controlled
by
the
the
growth
of
the
long
bones
is
also
dominated
by
the
it
would
seem
as
if
its
secretion
dedicated
to
the
one
function
could
not
be
available
for
the
other
so
it
happens
that
those
in
whom
growth
ceases
early
probably
because
of
an
earlier
and
more
vigorous
invasion
of
the
internal
secretion
system
by
the
interstitial
cell
product
develop
mental
maturity
more
rapidly
and
possess
more
of
it
than
those
in
whom
growth
continues
the
acumen
and
salacity
of
certain
dwarfs
is
proverbial
the
puberty
phenomena
teach
that
sex
crises
of
every
sort
are
dependent
fundamentally
upon
fluctuations
periodic
or
aperiodic
of
the
sex
index
as
we
have
defined
it
the
determining
factors
of
sex
life
the
material
summarized
in
the
preceding
paragraphs
furnish
some
slight
inkling
of
the
vast
dominion
of
sex
in
all
its
relations
somatic
and
spiritual
over
which
the
glands
of
internal
secretions
rule
the
founder
of
modern
pathology
virchow
said
that
woman
is
woman
because
of
her
ovaries
he
meant
that
woman
is
a
woman
the
sort
of
woman
she
specifically
is
because
of
her
internal
secretions
but
no
divine
decree
has
laid
down
a
line
of
cleavage
between
man
and
woman
there
are
fundamental
constitutional
differences
between
man
and
woman
but
it
is
just
as
true
that
man
is
man
because
of
internal
secretions
we
have
seen
that
the
concepts
of
man
and
woman
are
the
of
a
curve
including
variations
of
every
possible
combination
that
are
embraced
in
the
construction
of
a
sex
index
this
sex
index
is
not
an
absolute
constant
although
its
range
of
fluctuation
is
pretty
well
fixed
at
birth
it
varies
from
day
to
day
year
to
year
depending
upon
the
influences
that
have
been
brought
to
bear
upon
it
but
it
determines
the
character
of
the
three
planes
of
sex
the
endocrine
the
vegetative
and
the
psychic
the
endocrine
is
concerned
with
the
fundamental
chemistry
of
sex
the
internal
secretions
which
determine
the
chemical
reactions
that
provide
the
free
energy
for
the
sex
process
upon
the
vegetative
plane
occur
those
transformations
tensions
and
relaxations
in
the
viscera
which
are
controlled
in
part
by
the
endocrines
and
in
part
by
the
experiences
of
the
individual
as
registered
in
his
subconscious
upon
the
psychic
conscious
planes
appear
the
echoes
and
reflections
of
the
occurrences
upon
the
other
two
planes
as
well
as
reactions
arising
in
the
brain
from
the
necessity
of
the
organism
reacting
as
a
whole
to
isolated
episodes
accompanying
is
a
of
the
organism
as
a
unit
the
three
planes
are
not
like
separate
plates
of
glass
one
raised
above
the
other
the
usual
idea
picture
of
planes
they
are
nebulae
swirling
into
each
other
influencing
and
being
influenced
continually
the
reactions
among
these
three
complexes
of
sex
create
the
milieu
for
the
variations
and
aberrations
of
tendency
character
and
conduct
which
stamp
his
unique
quality
upon
the
individual
sex
morale
is
likewise
so
influenced
the
fundamentals
of
sex
ethics
will
in
due
time
be
revised
in
accordance
with
these
conceptions
chapter

all
the

the
internal

upon
all
the
processes
of

a

a
man
nature
is
essentially
his
endocrine
nature
primarily
when
he
is
born
he
represents
a
particular
inherited
combination
of
different
glands
of
internal
secretion
they
constituting
the
inventory
of
his
vital
stock
in
trade
start
him
in
life
afterwards
food
the
routine
of
his
existence
the
accidents
of
experience
education
disease
and
misfortune
in
short
environment
modify
him
because
they
modify
his
ductless
glands
and
his
vegetative
apparatus
as
well
as
his
brain
depressing
some
parts
and
stimulating
others
and
so
rearranging
the
system
in
particular
will
he
be
transformed
as
the
gland
is
affected
which
is
the
centre
of
the
system
to
which
the
others
adapt
and
accommodate
themselves
the
inertia
of
the
system
is
very
great
almost
absolute
and
always
tends
to
return
if
he
has
children
he
hands
on
his
constellation
of
endocrines
in
spite
of
mishaps
not
at
all
or
only
slightly
transformed
sometimes
however
the
experiential
transformation
has
been
sufficiently
deep
and
shaken
the
very
constitution
of
his
so
family
dispositions
and
traits
national
and
racial
temperaments
are
propagated
maintained
and
varied
the
sex
instincts
hormone
reactions
as
we
have
seen
initiate
the
complicated
forces
processes
and
expressions
of
sex
the
dictum
of
the
founder
of
modern
pathology
virchow
that
woman
was
in
effect
an
appendix
to
the
ovaries
has
long
been
taken
to
apply
to
her
psychic
traits
as
well
as
somatic
her
mind
like
her
skin
her
hair
and
her
pelvis
is
a
product
of
the
ovarian
endocrines
but
these
determinations
are
by
no
means
her
monopoly
man
is
likewise
a
creation
of
the
chemical
wheels
within
wheels
and
springs
within
springs
that
are
his
glands
of
internal
secretion
that
he
is
not
so
obviously
an
appendix
to
his
testes
is
due
to
two
reasons
first
the
male
sex
hormones
have
not
the
instability
nor
cyclic
rhythmicity
of
the
female
secondly
and
perhaps
consequently
his
sex
instincts
have
become
overlayered
with
other
more
labile
instincts
with
habits
and
customs
and
necessities
that
appear
to
oust
the
sex
instinct
into
an
altogether
decentralized
position
moreover
it
is
the
function
of
the
female
to
be
the
excitor
in
the
sex
process
her
subconscious
thoroughly
aware
of
the
fact
sees
to
it
that
the
sex
instinct
stands
starkly
central
and
dominating
in
her
life
the
moods
of
love
like
the
more
stereotyped
manifestations
of
sex
are
dependent
upon
a
proper
supply
to
the
blood
of
the
internal
secretions
of
the
reproductive
organs
the
gonadal
endocrines
if
the
testes
are
removed
from
frogs
it
is
found
that
the
symptom
of
sex
desire
is
abolished
if
after
an
interval
of
several
days
the
testes
extract
is
injected
into
the
frog
the
reflex
reappears
for
a
few
days
the
hormone
provoking
this
sex
reflex
is
present
in
the
testes
only
during
the
breeding
season
in
birds
the
seasonal
nesting
and
migrating
instincts
may
be
eliminated
by
interfering
with
their
ovaries
at
the
same
tine
there
is
a
change
in
their
plumage
toward
the
male
type
similarly
the
males
when
their
sex
endocrines
are
cut
off
will
change
their
psychic
nature
as
well
as
physically
besides
owning
his
comb
his
spurs
and
brighter
feathers
the
rooster
struts
to
attract
the
female
and
fights
aggressively
with
his
sex
competitors
when
he
is
made
a
capon
he
loses
his
spurs
and
comb
and
distinctive
plumage
and
in
addition
becomes
retiring
and
submissive
in
short
a
in
his
instincts
as
well
as
in
appearance
if
the
genital
glands
are
extirpated
from
a
male
before
puberty
the
wattles
remain
small
pale
and
bloodless
no
active
amorous
or
combative
instinct
emerges
the
creature
maintains
a
demure
silence
and
may
even
be
sought
by
a
virile
male
so
we
may
see
homosexuality
of
a
kind
in
the
lowest
animals
on
the
other
hand
hens
deprived
of
ovaries
tend
to
metamorphose
in
the
male
direction
even
to
acquire
the
male
spurs
and
to
display
the
male
attitudes
all
through
the
animal
world
in
the
springtime
when
the
pituitary
awakens
or
increases
its
secretion
and
so
stimulates
the
sex
glands
to
augmented
activity
emotions
of
sex
and
their
expression
are
provoked
by
the
inner
stirring
when
the
nightingale
warbles
passionately
and
the
mocking
bird
gurgles
provokingly
when
the
robin
fills
its
scarlet
breast
and
the
starling
floats
in
ecstasy
through
the
perfumed
air
when
the
pigeon
coyly
woos
its
mate
and
the
butterfly
flirts
with
the
dazzling
multicolors
of
its
wings
when
all
the
marvelous
devices
of
sex
attraction
in
nature
selection
and
courting
mating
and
reproducing
are
pondered
who
but
must
wonder
at
the
infinite
possibilities
of
reaction
of
the
sex
hormones
all
is
for
love
and
all
is
because
of
the
love
in
the
blood
that
is
manufactured
unconsciously
by
a
few
hidden
cells
expressionism
and
exhibitionism
we
need
a
detailed
examination
of
the
various
forms
of
expression
art
has
differentiated
into
in
its
relation
to
exhibitionism
and
as
effects
of
the
circulating
substance
of
the
gonads
sex
exhibition
differs
in
man
and
woman
because
of
the
differently
combined
internal
secretions
that
are
their
substrates
the
attitude
aggressive
pursuit
is
instigated
by
the
compound
adrenal
and
gonad
endocrines
the
female
various
emulsions
of
coyness
and
display
are
motivated
by
posterior
pituitary
and
gonad
hormones
in
alliance
it
is
a
dogma
to
state
that
the
internal
secretions
of
sex
do
not
begin
to
function
until
after
puberty
some
children
manifest
exhibitionism
with
a
certain
independence
of
environment
before
adolescence
a
good
many
girls
act
like
and
are
distinguishable
externally
from
boys
only
by
their
clothes
but
others
display
signs
of
sex
differentiation
that
are
to
be
traced
back
to
an
awakening
interstitial
gonad
action
some
boys
have
no
interest
whatever
in
sex
others
will
show
an
intense
curiosity
spontaneously
a
curiosity
which
perhaps
may
be
explained
as
a
larval
precocity
dependent
upon
the
minimum
of
sex
hormone
production
by
the
gonads
close
observation
of
the
correlation
of
somatic
and
psychic
development
in
extreme
examples
of
these
children
corroborates
this
view
jonathan
hutchinson
has
described
children
of
london
already
boasting
of
their
affairs
indeed
as
education
and
environment
affect
the
body
in
so
far
as
they
influence
it
as
a
whole
by
exciting
or
inhibiting
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
stimuli
from
without
must
be
considered
to
evoke
their
effects
as
stimulants
of
the
latent
puberty
glands
at
puberty
when
the
sex
glands
bloom
and
the
complex
of
the
sex
instincts
is
activated
exhibitionism
manifests
itself
in
a
host
of
guises
and
disguises
femininity
in
a
woman
the
womanly
woman
or
the
eternal
feminine
may
indeed
be
defined
by
the
degree
of
somatic
and
psychic
exhibitionism
she
presents
a
woman
who
has
a
delicate
skin
lovely
complexion
breasts
and
menstruates
freely
will
be
found
to
have
the
typical
feminine
outlook
on
life
aspirations
and
reactions
to
stimuli
which
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
our
feminists
do
constitute
the
biologic
feminine
mind
large
vascular
balanced
ovaries
are
the
of
her
life
and
personality
on
the
other
hand
the
woman
who
menstruates
poorly
or
not
at
all
is
heavily
built
angular
in
her
outlines
will
also
be
often
aggressive
dominating
even
enterprising
and
pioneering
in
short
masculinoid
she
is
what
she
is
because
she
possesses
small
shrivelled
poorly
functioning
ovaries
between
these
two
types
all
sorts
of
transitions
exist
according
as
the
other
endocrines
participate
in
the
constitutional
but
no
better
examples
could
be
given
of
the
determining
stamp
of
the
internal
secretions
upon
mind
character
and
conduct
instinct
and
behaviour
the
sex
instinct
analyzed
as
an
endocrine
mechanism
provides
the
clue
to
the
understanding
of
all
instinct
and
behaviour
if
the
regulates
the
maternal
instinct
then
its
correlates
sympathy
social
impulses
and
religious
feeling
must
be
also
influenced
and
so
is
furnished
another
example
of
a
chemical
control
of
instinctive
behaviour
mcdougall
once
of
oxford
now
of
harvard
introduced
into
psychology
the
idea
of
the
simple
instinct
as
a
unit
of
behaviour
regarding
the
most
complex
conduct
as
a
compounding
of
instincts
the
instinct
itself
he
analyzed
into
three
elements
a
specific
an
emotion
following
all
ending
in
a
particular
course
of
muscular
reaction
translated
into
endocrine
terms
what
happens
may
be
pictured
as
a
series
of
chemical
events
when
the
activity
of
a
ductless
gland
rises
above
a
certain
minimum
its
hormones
in
the
blood
sensitize
as
a
photographic
plate
is
sensitized
a
group
of
brain
cells
to
respond
to
a
message
from
the
outside
world
with
a
definite
line
of
conduct
there
is
a
registration
by
the
brain
cells
of
the
presence
of
the
specific
stimulus
then
there
is
communication
by
them
with
the
endocrine
organs
as
a
result
some
of
them
are
moved
to
further
secretion
and
others
are
paralyzed
or
weakened
in
consequence
of
changes
of
concentration
in
the
blood
of
the
various
internal
secretions
tensions
movements
and
tumescences
as
well
as
relaxations
inhibitions
and
detumescences
occur
throughout
the
vegetative
system
the
blood
vessels
the
viscera
the
nerves
and
the
muscles
each
wires
to
the
brain
news
of
the
change
in
it
in
addition
the
brain
cells
themselves
are
excited
or
depressed
by
the
new
hormones
bathing
them
in
their
final
fusion
the
commingling
vegetative
sensations
constitute
the
emotion
evolved
in
the
functioning
of
the
instinct
to
lower
the
new
tensions
throughout
the
vegetative
system
to
the
normal
range
the
instinctive
action
is
carried
out
this
superficially
is
regarded
as
the
essence
of
the
instinct
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
only
the
endpoint
of
a
process
the
resultant
of
a
drive
to
restore
equilibrium
within
the
organism
it
may
all
happen
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
about
it
the
play
of
an
instinct
may
therefore
be
analyzed
into
four
processes
they
succeed
one
another
as
sensation
endocrine
stimulation
tension
within
the
vegetative
system
conduct
to
relieve
tension
the
dash
is
the
symbol
of
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
this
equation
for
an
instinct
based
upon
an
analysis
of
the
working
of
the
sex
instinct
is
the
model
for
the
analysis
of
all
instincts
and
therefore
of
all
the
compounded
instincts
that
all
human
behaviour
may
be
resolved
into
conduct
that
fascinator
of
the
common
gossip
and
the
great
novelist
alike
normal
and
abnormal
social
and
asocial
in
all
their
complexities
even
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
the
freudian
complexes
is
governed
therefore
by
the
same
laws
that
determine
the
movements
of
the
stars
and
the
eruptions
of
volcanoes
the
most
interesting
factor
in
the
instinct
equation
is
the
endocrine
because
that
is
the
one
that
is
most
purely
chemical
endocrine
charging
of
wishes
it
is
distinction
of
modern
psychology
that
it
has
established
the
wish
craving
need
desire
libido
as
the
moving
force
in
any
psychic
process
the
position
of
the
wish
in
psychology
as
the
force
within
and
behind
the
instinct
may
be
compared
to
that
of
energy
in
physics
when
it
was
elevated
to
a
central
position
in
the
explanation
of
physical
processes
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
concept
of
the
wish
has
illuminated
all
the
hidden
recesses
and
rendered
audible
all
the
subdued
murmurings
of
the
mind
the
truly
novel
in
the
content
of
the
idea
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
wish
is
charged
now
it
could
never
be
charged
in
a
vacuum
that
means
that
a
wish
could
never
be
born
in
the
brain
alone
for
the
brain
has
no
power
to
charge
itself
with
energy
it
can
only
store
and
transmit
if
a
wish
is
potential
energy
that
must
be
transformed
into
kinetic
it
must
have
a
source
that
source
is
the
vegetative
system
without
the
vegetative
system
the
great
complex
of
viscera
in
the
abdomen
and
chest
blood
and
its
vessels
endocrines
muscles
and
nerves
the
brain
would
remain
but
an
intricate
cold
storage
plant
of
memories
associations
of
past
experiences
it
would
need
no
change
and
initiate
no
effort
but
when
the
wish
enters
upon
the
scene
it
is
as
if
a
dead
storage
battery
has
been
refreshed
with
new
current
enriched
with
billions
of
electrons
there
is
a
stir
and
a
movement
dynamic
mind
but
the
dynamo
is
the
more
ancient
possession
of
the
animal
the
vegetative
apparatus
in
short
what
must
always
be
remembered
is
that
a
wish
is
never
cerebral
but
always
visceral
in
its
origins
the
makes
the
cerebral
activities
in
the
nervous
system
below
the
brain
and
especially
the
vegetative
system
force
upon
it
its
function
of
the
active
verb
it
has
to
be
to
do
and
to
suffer
and
then
to
manipulate
the
environment
to
satiate
the
insatiable
viscera
insatiable
because
the
local
chemistry
is
continually
raising
the
tension
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
a
physics
of
human
behaviour
becomes
possible
with
the
aid
of
these
concepts
of
endocrine
regulation
of
intravisceral
pressure
and
intervisceral
equilibrium
an
intramuscular
pressure
and
an
intermuscular
equilibrium
with
the
brain
as
the
shifting
fulcrum
of
the
system
the
sensation
of
hunger
as
we
have
seen
serves
as
good
an
exemplar
as
any
of
this
mechanism
of
the
wish
hunger
is
preceded
and
accompanied
by
contractions
of
the
stomach
of
increasing
intensity
those
contractions
must
be
brought
about
by
a
substance
acting
upon
the
nerve
endings
in
the
wall
of
the
stomach
as
it
closes
down
upon
itself
waves
pass
up
and
down
with
each
wave
the
pressure
within
it
rises
the
exact
amount
of
the
pressure
may
be
accurately
measured
by
means
of
a
small
balloon
swallowed
and
then
inflated
when
the
pressure
rises
above
a
certain
figure
the
sensation
of
hunger
breaks
into
the
consciousness
of
the
individual
we
infer
that
certain
sensory
impulses
sent
up
to
the
brain
attain
a
strength
that
finally
forces
itself
into
the
conscious
field
of
feeling
the
sensation
of
hunger
varies
from
individual
to
individual
because
of
variation
in
the
reaction
throughout
the
vegetative
system
most
often
it
is
a
sense
of
movement
or
even
an
itch
in
the
upper
abdomen
let
some
cause
produce
a
weakening
or
cessation
of
the
movements
of
the
stomach
as
fear
and
anger
and
the
sensation
of
hunger
disappears
coincidently
with
the
drop
in
the
pressure
within
it
as
the
mathematicians
would
say
the
wish
is
a
function
of
the
pressure
and
so
of
the
concentration
of
substance
behind
the
pressure
we
have
in
hunger
the
wish
reduced
to
the
lowest
terms
the
most
primitive
form
of
it
yet
we
may
resolve
all
wishes
even
the
most
idealistic
into
the
same
terms
as
the
vegetative
system
becomes
habituated
by
repeated
experience
to
react
in
the
same
way
to
the
same
stimulus
permutations
and
combinations
of
wishes
become
possible
until
at
length
the
inscrutable
complexities
of
the
behaviour
of
civilized
man
are
evolved
we
have
to
thank
von
bechterew
the
greatest
of
russian
physiologists
for
these
fundamental
principles
so
important
for
the
understanding
of
the
control
of
human
life
and
conduct
the
associated
reflex
aboriginal
ancestor
of
the
involved
train
of
associations
that
constitute
the
highest
thought
conduct
and
character
is
the
unit
of
the
system
recall
the
classic
example
cited
if
a
piece
of
meat
is
shown
to
a
dog
his
mouth
waters
if
now
you
proceed
to
ring
a
bell
before
offering
the
meat
his
mouth
will
water
only
when
he
sees
or
smells
the
meat
if
however
the
ringing
of
the
bell
precedes
the
meat
a
sufficient
number
of
reactions
a
time
comes
when
merely
the
sound
of
the
bell
will
cause
salivation
without
the
presence
of
the
meat
so
it
is
with
the
associated
reactions
of
the
internal
secretions
a
stimulus
originally
indifferent
to
the
endocrines
may
by
association
the
laws
of
which
are
many
come
to
act
like
a
spark
to
the
mechanism
hence
we
can
account
for
the
subtle
play
of
instinct
throughout
all
thinking
even
objects
resembling
the
specific
excitant
of
an
instinct
only
remotely
or
in
some
one
quality
may
start
its
mechanism
and
a
host
of
associations
bound
up
with
it
thus
the
maternal
instinct
may
be
excited
by
the
sight
of
a
baby
but
because
a
baby
is
small
and
delicate
anything
small
and
fine
a
tiny
book
a
toy
a
miniature
may
arouse
it
the
object
is
then
said
to
be
appealing
the
doctrine
of
association
of
instinctive
and
so
of
endocrine
reactions
enables
us
to
understand
the
feeling
tone
that
at
any
moment
pervades
consciousness
as
well
as
its
content
choices
the
psychology
of
selection
of
food
color
friends
mates
amusements
also
become
explicable
rationally
for
conflicts
among
the
different
components
of
the
vegetative
system
are
continuous
and
inevitable
if
the
pressure
within
a
viscus
has
been
heightened
and
persists
that
is
is
not
disturbed
by
some
other
associated
factor
or
instinct
conduct
results
to
lower
the
pressure
to
what
it
was
before
the
instigator
of
the
tension
appeared
but
if
another
instinct
is
sparked
or
another
associated
factor
comes
into
play
another
focus
of
increased
pressure
within
the
vegetative
system
is
created
with
another
stream
of
energy
flowing
to
the
brain
and
demanding
an
outlet
this
clash
of
instincts
the
struggle
between
different
foci
of
the
vegetative
system
competing
for
the
possession
of
the
brain
is
a
common
everyday
process
in
conduct
which
will
win
means
which
will
will
and
so
we
have
an
energetic
basis
for
volition
which
will
win
appears
to
depend
primarily
upon
the
kind
of
endocrines
that
predominate
in
the
of
the
individual
secondarily
with
his
education
for
it
is
the
endocrines
that
are
really
in
conflict
when
there
is
a
struggle
between
two
instincts
and
if
one
endocrine
system
conquers
it
must
be
either
because
it
is
inherently
stronger
its
secretion
potential
that
is
the
amount
of
secretion
it
can
put
forth
as
a
maximum
is
greater
so
explaining
the
term
dominant
or
because
a
past
experience
has
conditioned
it
to
respond
although
the
opposing
endocrine
system
does
not
fear
and
anger
respectively
bound
up
with
the
activities
of
the
adrenal
medulla
and
cortex
we
shall
see
provide
as
good
exemplars
as
any
of
this
process
the
response
of
the
ductless
glands
to
situations
varies
with
their
congenital
and
acquired
capacity
is
a
question
of
internal
chemistry
modifiable
by
injury
disease
accident
shock
exhaustion
susceptibility
depends
upon
the
play
of
the
forces
focusing
upon
them
that
may
be
summed
up
as
associations
in
the
ability
of
one
endocrine
system
to
inhibit
another
we
have
the
germ
of
the
unconscious
hence
the
modus
operandi
of
the
repressions
and
suppressions
compensations
and
dissociations
which
may
unite
to
integrate
or
refuse
to
integrate
and
so
disintegrate
and
deteriorate
a
personality
as
the
personality
develops
the
vegetative
system
becomes
susceptible
to
the
manifold
associates
of
family
school
church
and
society
art
science
and
religion
and
last
but
not
least
sex
all
the
different
nuances
of
personality
are
expressions
of
a
particular
relationship
transitory
or
permanent
between
the
endocrines
and
the
viscera
and
muscles
conversely
behaviour
shows
what
a
person
actually
is
chemically
that
is
what
endocrine
and
vegetative
factors
predominate
in
his
fear
anger
and
courage
fear
and
anger
are
the
oldest
and
so
the
most
of
the
instincts
an
ameba
contracting
at
the
touch
of
some
unpleasant
object
feels
fear
in
its
most
primitive
form
and
anger
the
destructive
passion
must
have
appeared
early
upon
the
scene
of
life
certainly
these
two
instincts
were
definitely
developed
and
fixed
in
the
cells
before
sex
differentiation
and
the
sex
instincts
were
born
at
all
it
is
interesting
to
note
this
for
our
rabid
freudians
fear
and
anger
involve
the
adrenal
gland
how
comes
it
that
two
states
of
mind
so
contrasted
should
involve
the
same
area
the
answer
lies
in
the
bipartite
construction
of
the
adrenal
all
the
evidence
points
to
its
medulla
as
the
secretor
of
the
substance
which
makes
for
the
phenomena
of
fear
and
to
its
cortex
as
dominant
in
the
reactions
of
anger
when
adrenalin
is
injected
under
the
skin
in
sufficient
quantity
it
will
produce
paleness
trembling
erection
of
the
hair
twitching
of
the
limbs
quick
or
gasping
breathing
twitching
of
the
lips
all
the
classic
manifestations
of
fear
these
are
the
immediate
effects
of
fear
because
they
are
the
immediate
effects
of
excess
adrenalin
in
the
blood
upon
the
vegetative
viscera
and
the
muscles
the
perception
by
associative
memory
of
these
effects
of
adrenalin
the
sensations
arising
from
the
organs
affected
constitute
the
emotion
of
fear
flight
follows
by
muscle
prepared
for
flight
for
the
disturbance
of
the
equilibrium
tenses
the
flexor
muscles
the
muscles
of
flight
and
relaxes
the
extensor
muscles
the
muscles
of
attack
if
it
would
seem
the
cortex
secretion
now
pours
into
the
blood
enough
to
more
than
overcome
the
effects
of
the
medulla
secretion
the
equilibrium
is
disturbed
in
the
opposite
direction
for
fight
rather
than
flight
and
anger
results
or
if
the
cortical
secretion
pours
in
an
overwhelming
amount
of
its
secretion
from
the
first
into
the
blood
there
will
be
no
fear
but
anger
immediately
habitually
charging
and
fearless
animals
like
the
bison
bull
tiger
or
lion
have
a
relatively
larger
cortex
in
their
adrenals
habitually
fleeing
and
fearful
animals
like
the
rabbit
have
a
small
cortex
and
a
wide
medulla
in
their
adrenals
the
reinforcing
action
of
the
thyroid
is
important
the
adrenal
medulla
reinforced
by
the
thyroid
makes
for
terror
the
adrenal
cortex
reinforced
by
the
thyroid
makes
for
fury
some
people
are
not
easily
frightened
others
are
more
readily
frightened
and
still
others
are
of
an
extremely
fearful
nature
it
depends
upon
the
proportion
of
adrenal
cortex
to
medulla
secretion
in
them
and
their
reaction
to
fear
stimuli
is
a
pretty
good
measure
of
the
ratio
these
formulations
apply
more
particularly
to
fear
in
general
and
anger
in
general
but
even
in
the
least
fearsome
an
individual
in
whom
cortex
dominates
medulla
there
may
be
fear
complexes
dating
back
to
events
and
times
when
medulla
overtopped
cortex
especially
childhood
so
in
the
coolest
people
certain
persons
objects
episodes
may
send
a
wave
along
an
old
line
of
nerve
cells
and
paths
which
lead
to
the
adrenal
medulla
and
so
flood
him
with
fear
terror
or
even
panic
before
his
usual
cortex
response
occurs
impressions
during
the
early
years
of
childhood
probing
of
the
unconscious
by
various
methods
have
been
shown
to
be
the
most
potent
in
this
respect
sometimes
the
episode
goes
further
back
than
childhood
and
one
must
assume
an
inherited
conditioning
of
the
vegetative
and
endocrine
systems
an
animal
leaping
upon
an
ancestor
in
a
forest
during
the
night
might
account
for
the
panic
fear
some
people
experience
when
alone
in
the
dark
that
nothing
of
their
childhood
history
may
account
for
in
women
the
adrenal
medulla
naturally
tends
to
overtop
the
cortex
because
the
latter
makes
for
masculinity
besides
the
recurring
cycle
in
the
ovary
making
the
corpus
luteum
evolves
an
additional
stimulant
to
the
medulla
through
its
irritating
influence
upon
the
thyroid
then
the
influence
of
the
is
cortex
so
that
on
the
whole
a
number
of
endocrines
work
to
render
woman
naturally
fearful
as
we
say
courage
is
so
closely
related
to
fear
and
anger
that
all
are
always
associated
in
any
discussion
courage
is
commonly
thought
of
as
the
emotion
that
is
the
opposite
of
fear
it
would
follow
that
courage
meant
simply
inhibition
of
the
adrenal
medulla
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mechanism
of
courage
is
more
complex
one
must
distinguish
animal
courage
and
deliberate
courage
animal
courage
is
literally
the
courage
of
the
beast
as
noted
animals
with
the
largest
amounts
of
adrenal
cortex
are
the
pugnacious
aggressive
charging
kings
of
the
fields
and
forests
the
emotion
experienced
by
them
is
probably
anger
with
a
sort
of
and
no
consideration
of
the
consequences
the
object
attacked
acted
like
the
red
rag
waved
at
a
bull
it
had
stimulated
a
flow
of
the
secretion
of
the
adrenal
cortex
and
the
instinct
of
anger
became
sparked
as
it
were
by
the
new
condition
of
the
blood
in
courage
deliberate
courage
there
is
more
than
instinct
there
is
an
act
of
volition
a
display
of
will
admitting
that
without
the
adrenal
cortex
such
courage
would
be
impossible
the
chief
credit
for
courage
must
be
ascribed
to
the
it
is
the
proper
conjunction
of
its
secretion
and
that
of
the
adrenal
cortex
that
makes
for
true
courage
so
it
is
we
find
that
acts
of
courage
have
been
recorded
most
often
of
individuals
of
the
type
photographs
are
obtainable
of
winners
of
the
congressional
medal
of
honor
for
extraordinary
bravery
in
the
war
with
germany
of
these
exhibited
the
somatic
criteria
or
hormonic
signs
of
the
type
a
prerequisite
for
adequate
function
is
a
normal
secretion
of
the
interstitial
cells
of
the
reproductive
glands
cowardice
is
said
to
be
a
feature
of
eunuchs
the
pituitary
and
instinct
we
have
seen
that
more
than
any
other
gland
or
tissue
of
the
body
the
governs
the
instincts
and
their
sublimations
the
social
and
creative
instincts
a
great
deal
of
evidence
is
in
our
possession
concerning
the
disturbances
of
emotion
accompanying
disturbances
of
this
gland
and
controllable
by
its
control
it
might
be
said
to
energize
deeply
the
tender
emotions
and
instead
of
saying
we
should
say
for
all
the
basic
sentiments
as
opposed
to
the
intellectualized
sentimentalism
sympathy
and
suggestibility
are
interlocked
with
its
functions
its
secretion
must
act
upon
the
great
basal
ganglia
at
the
base
of
the
brain
which
contain
the
nerve
cells
and
fibres
that
are
the
centers
of
emotional
control
and
the
has
been
depicted
as
the
gland
of
intellectuality
to
use
that
term
for
lack
of
better
by
intellectuality
we
mean
the
capacity
of
the
mind
to
control
its
environment
by
concepts
and
abstract
ideas
the
frontal
lobes
of
the
brain
are
the
central
offices
for
higher
thought
their
cells
are
the
most
complex
have
the
most
numerous
branches
and
association
fibres
they
store
the
fruits
of
abstract
thinking
mathematics
for
example
the
anterior
pituitary
is
in
the
closest
relation
and
contact
with
them
its
secretion
is
tonic
to
them
now
the
instinct
that
is
the
forerunner
of
intellectuality
is
the
instinct
of
curiosity
with
its
emotion
of
wonder
and
its
expression
in
the
various
constructive
and
acquisitive
tendencies
studies
of
intellectual
men
and
of
those
with
a
keen
instinct
of
curiosity
and
a
trend
prove
them
to
be
dominant
in
their
the
administration
of
extract
to
some
defectives
increases
intellectual
activity
and
the
future
of
intelligence
may
expect
a
great
deal
from
the
newer
chemistry
of
the
secretions
of
the
two
most
important
instincts
therefore
which
in
the
complexity
of
their
sublimations
have
created
most
of
the
institutions
of
society
the
maternal
and
the
intellectual
are
connected
directly
with
a
proper
function
of
the
pituitary
endocrines
so
it
happens
that
disturbances
of
these
instincts
reaching
far
into
the
normal
and
intellectual
spheres
of
the
mind
are
definitely
connected
with
disturbances
of
the
pituitary
as
we
shall
note
in
reviewing
the
essentials
of
the
or
personality
the
personality
governed
by
the
fluctuations
of
activity
within
the
pituitary
people
with
injured
diseased
or
mechanically
limited
pituitaries
because
of
the
smallness
of
the
bony
case
enclosing
them
exhibit
defects
and
perversions
of
conduct
and
intelligence
directly
attributable
to
affections
of
the
very
instincts
and
functions
the
pituitary
governs
children
with
small
mechanically
cramped
pituitaries
lie
and
steal

poor
control
over

and
a
low

the

and
instinct
the
chemical
mechanism
of
the
instincts
described
sex
libido
passion
and
jealousy
in
relation
to
the
ovaries
and
testes
fear
and
anger
in
relation
to
the
adrenals
sympathy
and
curiosity
in
relation
to
the
pituitaries
suggests
that
a
similar
explanation
will
hold
for
the
dynamics
of
the
other
instincts
in
the
closest
relation
to
the
thyroid
appear
the
instincts
first
isolated
so
to
speak
by
mcdougall
as
the
instincts
of
and
accompanied
by
emotions
of
pride
and
shame
respectively
in
certain
states
of
excessive
thyroid
activity
there
is
an
extra
stimulation
of
the
instinctive
display
of
the
person
which
may
go
on
to
boasting
mania
and
exhibitionism
on
the
other
hand
in
states
of
thyroid
insufficiency
depression
is
produced
which
may
go
on
to
melancholia
a
desire
to
be
alone
to
hide
to
sit
apart
and
even
a
tendency
to
accuse
the
self
of
various
uncommitted
crimes
and
sins
in
the
form
of
cyclic
insanity
known
as
the
psychosis
mania
alternates
with
depression
as
if
the
personality
were
dominated
wholly
in
turn
by
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
instincts
of
the
ego
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
that
behind
them
is
a
corresponding
fluctuation
in
the
amount
the
thyroid
secretes
into
the
blood
among
the
attitudes
toward
the
self
gyrate
more
than
in
any
other
type
egomania
and
megalomania
occur
most
often
in
thyroid
unstable
individuals
energy
and
sensitivity
in
his
classic
inquiries
into
human
faculty
francis
galton
laid
down
some
fundamental
considerations
concerning
energy
and
sensitivity
as
mental
traits
energy
he
defined
as
the
capacity
for
labor
and
declared
it
to
be
the
measure
of
the
fullness
of
life
or
vitality
statistical
study
by
him
of
men
of
genius
and
their
ancestors
showed
them
to
be
endowed
with
a
large
amount
of
energy
it
has
been
said
to
be
the
absolute
prerequisite
of
genius
now
if
there
is
a
single
fact
that
has
been
well
established
by
investigations
of
the
internal
secretions
it
is
that
the
energy
quantum
of
an
individual
is
a
function
of
and
determined
by
his
thyroid
the
more
thyroid
he
has
the
more
energetic
will
he
be
the
less
thyroid
the
less
energetic

the
lazier
the
individual
of
the
excess
thyroid
type
actually
burns
up
more
food
and
produces
more
heat
than
the
ordinary
organism
he
burns
himself
up
faster
in
general
when
the
thyroid
sends
more
secretion
into
the
blood
more
thyroxin
it
accelerates
all
the
functions
and
activities
of
the
organs
tea
and
coffee
produce
loquacity
because
they
stimulate
the
thyroid
people
with
thyroid
dominant
constitutions
talk
fluently
rapidly
and
continuously
their
energy
makes
them
doers
actors
rather
than
spectators
they
get
up

in

are
on

all
day
without
surcease
or

go
to

late
and
often
suffer
from
insomnia
thyroid
deficients
however
are
definitely
the
opposite
they
are
quite
conscious
of
the
limited
reserve
of
energy
at
their
command
also
that
they
need
plenty
of
refreshing
sleep
early
to
bed
and
late
to
rise
remains
the
leading
maxim
of
health
for
them
in
addition
they
find
it
necessary
to
sleep
during
the
day
forty
winks
or
more
in
the
afternoon
makes
a
good
deal
of
difference
to
them
taciturn
inarticulate
lazy
slow
tired
are
the
adjectives
applied
to
them
by
their
friends
as
well
as
by
their
enemies
all
because
of
an
insufficient
or
inefficient
supply
of
the
thyroid
iodine
to
their

the
mobility
of

is
a

of
the

in

poorly

sensitivity
the
ability
to
discriminate
between
grades
of

or
acuteness
of

is
another
thyroid
quality
just
as
the
thyroid
plus
is
more
energetic
so
is
he
more
sensitive
he
feels
things
more
he
feels
pain
more
readily
because
he
arrives
more
quickly
at
the
stage
when
the
stimulus
damages
his
nerve
apparatus
the
electric
conductivity
of
his
skin
is
greater
sometimes
a
hundred
times
greater
than
the
average
conversely
the
thyroid
deficient
type
has
a
low
discriminative
faculty
galton
has
recorded
that
idiots
hardly
distinguish
between
heat
and
cold
and
that
their

is
so
obtuse
that
some
of
the

hardly
to

it
is
cretins

energy

sensitivity
in
an
individual
should
direct
attention
to
the

element
predominating
in

composition
lack
of

and
insensitivity
to
the
degree
of
thyroid
insufficiency
in
their

judgment
and
poise
in
between

and

the

and
the
reaction
comes
a
passage
of
the
stimulus
through
the
gauntlet
of
the
stored
past
experience
of
the
individual
known
as
memory
many
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
by
philosophers
psychologists
and
physiologists
to
explain
the
phenomenona
of
memory
to
conceive
of
memory
materially
at
all
one
must
admit
some
sort
of
memory
trace
as
the
basis
for
the
persistence
of
memory
this
memory
deposit
facilitates
the
occurrence
of
the
chemical
reaction
constituting
the
memory
along
the
same
path
the
next
time
forgetting
then
consists
in
a
disappearance
of
these
memory
traces
or
deposits
forgetting
is
greatest
in
the
first
hour
after
remembering
more
than
half
of
the
memory
trace
being
lost
in
that
time
comparison
of
the
curve
of
forgetting
and
the
curve
of
diffusion
of
a
colloid
like
gelatine
from
its
solution
into
a
surrounding
medium
shows
them
to
be
exceedingly
similar
forgetting
may
be
explained
by
some
such
loss
of
the
memory
trace
or
deposit
into
the
blood
continually
flowing
by
it
the
internal
secretions
influence
the
amount
and
duration
of
the
memory
deposits
the
thyroid
appears
to
be
essential
to
the
of
the
memory
trace
cretins
have
poor
memories
on
the
retention
side
and
so
can
not
learn
the
memory
of
thyroid
insufficients
is
wretched
in
the
extreme
grades
the
memory
for
recent
occurrences
becomes
completely
lost
iodine
and
thyroid
increase
the
electric
conductivity
of
the
brain
so
that
the
memory
trace
must
be
deposited
more
easily
in
those
who
have
an
excess
of
thyroid
removal
of
the
thyroid
produces
a
degeneration
of
nerve
cells
and
their
processes
and
associative
memory
becomes
difficult
or
impossible
because
conduction
from
cell
to
cell
is
interfered
with
if
sufficient
thyroid
is
fed
in
excess
brain
conduction
may
be
so
facilitated
that
epilepsy
may
result
upon
slight
irritation
on
the
other
hand
the
pituitary
seems
to
be
related
to
of
the
memory
deposit
in
conditions
of
disease
of
the
pituitary
loss
of
memory
for
past
experiences
is
more
marked
as
regards
recent
experiences
they
are
better
held
although
in
a
sort
of
subconscious
manner
recoverable
when
the
condition
improves
or
is
cured
but
the
greatest
difference
between
the
thyroid
and
pituitary
effects
upon
memory
exists
as
regards
material
the
thyroid
memory
applies
particularly
to
perception
and
percepts
the
pituitary
to
conception
reading
studying
thinking
and
concepts
judgment
is
another
mental
process
that
often
intervenes
between
sensation
and
the
it
involves
memory
and
association
of
experiences
behind
it
is
an
attitude
as
much
as
there
is
in
an
emotion
or
the
arousing
of
an
instinct
beliefs
and
reasonings
are
complex
judgments
they
form
the
units
of
the
intellectual
process
there
is
an
element
of
speed
in
judgment
on
reasoning
as
in
perception
and
memory
and
as
in
the
latter
the
thyroid
determines
the
velocity
quick
thinking
as
we
call
it
means
good
thyroid
action
and
slow
thinking
deficient
thyroid
action
the
other
element
in
judgment
accuracy
is
influenced
by
the
during
adolescence
there
is
physical
growth
which
consumes
most
of
the
secretion
of
the

adolescence
after
the
early
twenties
when
physical
growth
has
ceased
the
secretion
sensitizes
the
cells
of
the
brain
to
mental
growth
the
reaction

of
the

its
inherent
latent
ability
to
supply

maximum

chemical
determinant

genius

greatest
of

and
problems
into
one
harmonious
whole
and
curiously
not
only
does
it
cause
a
fusion
of
intellectual
material
it
creates
a
desire
for
and
a
love
of
such
material

should
expect
to
find
extraordinarily

eminent
philosophers
and

the

profit
by

and
to
make
more
and
more
accurate

as
one
grows
older
implies
at

a
maximum
efficiency
of

this
maturation
is
not
at
all

even
after

forty

the

of

their

often
coupled
with

francis
galton
pioneer

of

left
an
interesting
study
of
the
visualising
capacity
so
far
as
it
could
be
attacked
by
the
statistical
method
two
of
his
conclusions
are
worth
repeating
for
our
purposes
one
is
that
the
power
to
imagine
is
poor
in
philosophers
and
men
of
science
the
other
that
it
is
higher
in
the
female
sex
than
in
the
male
we
have
seen
that
the
philosophic
scientific
intellectual
mind
the
capacity
to
abstract
and
think
in
terms
of
abstractions
is
definitely
dependent
upon
proper
secretion
by
the
in
woman
the
is
generally
predominant
over
the
though
we
are
in
need
of
a
series
of
studies
of
the
endocrine
traits
and
composition
of
men
endowed
with
high
imaginative
qualities
and
so
are
at
a
loss
we
have
indications
of
an
endocrine
control
of
the
state
of
consciousness
we
speak
of
as
the
imaginative
most
of
the
evidence
accumulated
in
the
examination
and
treatment
of
morbid
conditions
characterized
by
a
restless
incoordinate
activity
of
the
brain
cells
points
to
excess
of
the
secretion
as
the
cause
or
as
one
of
the
most
important
causes
the
thyroid
and
the
adrenal
medulla
also
exert
their
influence

the
strongest
appears
to
be
the
phobias

which
obsess
the
mind
anxiety

sum
up

other
symptoms

overactivity

part
of
the
endocrine
cycle
of
their
everyday
lives
are
accompanied
by
increase
in
the
susceptibility
and
vigor
of
the
imagination
whether
the
feeding
of
excess
would
lead
to
a
stimulation
of
the
tendency
or
ability
to
imagine
is
still
to
be
decided
but
it
is
known
that
quieting
the
by
various
means
will
cause
a
depression
of
the

eliminate
its
pathologic
manifestations

themselves
to
be
fooled
by

as
an
explanation
for
the
phenomena
of

in

that
benign
mental
disorder
par

they
had
the
theory

the
triumphs
of

after
the

that
naïve
view
had
to
be
discarded
in

the
humoral
theory
held
sway
with
its
good
humors

its
bad

with
breuer
had
attempted
cure
by
the
method
of
free
association
attempting
to
get
the
hysteric
to
pour
out
her
mental
life
not
succeeding
and
his
interest
aroused
by
her
continual
references
to
her
dreams
he
discovered
that
by
means
of
those
dreams
he
could
tap
the
subconscious
and
unconscious
in
regions
hitherto
inaccessible
for
in
the
dreams
ideas
persons
and
experiences
appeared
that
never
came
upon
the
stage
of
the
conscious
from
that
finding
he
developed
the
concept
of
repression
the
relegation
of
a
painful
experience
into
the
unconscious
and
kept
imprisoned
there
by
the
censor
also
how
there
it
became
the
complex
which
like
a
stage
manager
never
appeared
before
the
footlights
of
the
conscious
but
determined
its
content
just
the
same
by
inhibition
or
stimulation
of
any
character
or
scene
to
be
enacted
upon
it
a
complete
critique
of
freudianism
can
not
be
attempted
here
but
in
relation
to
the
endocrine
system
as
controllers
of
nerve
function
in
health
and
disease
a
valid
criticism
can
be
made
firstly
the
freudian
jargon
its
technicalities
and
explanations
are
metaphors
some
may
regard
them
as
justifiable
descriptions
of
mental
processes
but
it
certainly
can
be
urged
against
them
that
they
provide
us
with
no
idea
concerning
what
is
happening
in
the
cells
of
the
body
and
brain
as
explanation
for
the
event
normal
or
abnormal
supposedly
explained
words
like
sublimation
or
transference
are
figures
of
speech
and
nothing
else
secondly
they
ignore
totally
the
powers
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
the
viscera
muscles
and
secreting
glands
together
as
originators
and
determiners
of
the
wish
and
its
adventures
how
utterly
different
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
physiologist
the
two
explanations
are
as
pictures
can
be
seen
from
a
single
example
the
idea
of
repression
to
the
freudian
means
the
pushing
down
into
the
subconscious
of
some
experience
pushing
down
is
a
process
controlled
by
the
laws
of
physics
it
involves
the
concepts
of
matter
and
force
hence
the
expression
as
a
description
of
a
psychic
episode
is
a
metaphor
pure
and
simple
from
the
standpoint
of
the
process
of
repression
as
pictured
by
the
student
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
the
term
signifies
a
real
bottling
up
of
energy
for
the
repression
means
actual
compression
of
muscle
the
muscle
contained
in
the
viscera
and
the
repression
means
a
real
interference
with
the
release
of
energy
which
remains
bound
up
tugging
for
room
for
expression
as
much
as
a
spring
tightly
coiled
in
a
box
in
the
production
of
that
tension
an
endocrine
has
often
been
decisive
the
endocrine
nature
of
the
individual
may
decide
whether
a
subconscious
visceral
or
vegetative
tension
is
to
come
into
being
live
or
die
in
the
face
of
a
given
situation
if
thereby
a
permanent
disturbance
of
the
equilibrium
between
the
components
is
brought
about
a
neurosis
expression
of
an
unsatisfied
vegetative
tension
follows
it
has
been
hailed
as
a
brand
new
discovery
by
those
following
the
latest
in
psychology
that
the
subconscious
and
the
unconscious
constitute
a
more
essential
component
of
the
personality
than
the
conscious
as
a
matter
of
fact
common
practice
has
recognized
the
fact
if
not
the
mechanism
and
its
significance
for
ages
it
is
not
what
people
say
or
do
it
is
how
they
say
it
that
is
how
the
true
reactions
of
personality
are
recognized
instinctively
even
by
animals
tone
and
gesture
when
not
acted
or
posed
are
accepted
as
symbols
and
symptoms
of
states
of
the
inmost
sancta
sanctorum
that
words
and
wit
never
give
entrance
to
nay
disguise
and
block
tone
and
gesture
as
revelations
of
the
the
or
if
you
will
are
so
potent
because
they
are
direct
expressions
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
the
curl
of
a
lip
the
flicker
of
an
the
twitch
of
a
shoulder
are
the
overflow
of
energy
cramped
in
the
increased
intravisceral
pressure
determined
by
increased
outflow
of
endocrine
secretion
wittingly
or
unwittingly
we
interpret
the
little
signs
as
messages
from
the
deepest
self
which
they
truly
are
nervous
breakdowns
and
shell
shock
in
civil
life
the
complex
of
symptoms
beard
jumbled
together
as
neurasthenia
when
associated
with
a
loss
of
so
that
the
sufferer
is
incapacitated
for
the
duties
of
everyday
life
has
become
the
popular
nervous
breakdown
a
sanitarium
appears
to
be
one
of
the
necessary
components
of
the
condition
it
is
the
last
act
the
climax
of
nerves
during
the
war
of
thousands
of
cases
of
functional
disorders
of
the
nervous
came
to
be
grouped
under
shell
shock
the
psychic
phenomena
in
the
wake
of
concussion
of
the
brain
due
to
explosives
suggested
the
term
and
its
application
to
affections
of
or
dissociations
of
the
personality
with
paralysis
blindness
speechlessness
loss
of
hearing
and
so
on
the
war
neurosis
including
those
arising
in
home
service
is
still
a
topical
subject
because
thousands
of
mentally
disabled
soldiers
are
alive
in
view
of
what
has
been
said
concerning
the
endocrine
mechanism
of
the
instincts
and
the
vegetative
apparatus
it
could
be
predicted
that
a
number
of
these
nerve
casualties
of
peace
and
war
would
be
caused
by
an
upset
of
the
equilibrium
between
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
a
study
of
war
neuroses
by
the
great
italian
student
of
the
endocrines
pende
confirms
this
assumption
as
emphasized
the
internal
secretions
are
like
tuning
keys
and
tighten
or
loosen
the
strings
of
the
the
nerves
war
for
the
soldier
or
the
civilian
combatant
as
well
sets
the
strings
vibrating
and
with
them
the
glands
controlled
by
them
excessive
stimulation
or
depression
of
an
endocrine
will
disturb
the
whole
chain
of
hormones
and
the
vegetative
system
and
their
echoes
in
the
psyche
the
nervous
disorders
of
war
that
have
been
lumped
as
shell
shock
or
war
shock
may
be
looked
upon
as
uncompensated
airings
of
the
endocrine
vegetative
mechanism
as
dislocations
of
parts
and
processes
that
are
reflected
outwardly
as
ailment
or
disease
an
endocrine
neurosis
an
exquisite
example
of
an
endocrine
neurosis
that
is
a
disorder
of
nerves
and
brain
dependent
upon
an
upset
of
the
equilibrium
between
the
internal
secretions
due
to
a
trying
experience
was
furnished
recently
by
the
reactions
of
three
naval
officers
lost
in
the
snow
wilds
of
canada
through
a
balloon
adventure
the
cases
aroused
a
good
deal
of
interest
at
the
time
and
the
details
were
reported
by
the
newspapers
as
if
they
were
the
episodes
of
a
serial
mystery
story
the
three
officers
started
out
late
one
fine
evening
from
rockaway
air
station
in
a
balloon
for
a
practice
trip
atmospheric
conditions
suddenly
changed
they
became
lost
in
the
clouds
and
finally
landed
somewhere
in
the
canadian
wilderness
the
commander
of
the
balloon
crew
lieut
years
old
was
the
youngest
of
the
three
the
oldest
lieut
being
and
the
third
man
in
the
thirties
lieut
according
to
the
testimony
given
at
the
court
of
inquiry
held
afterwards
two
hours
after
they
abandoned
the
balloon
and
started
struggling
through
the
snow
became
tired
and
complained
of
his
fatigue
b
fatigue
increased
and
two
days
later
became
so
great
that
the
party
had
to
stop
for
an
hour
and
build
a
fire
in
order
to
permit
him
to
rest
however
an
hour
proved
too
little
and
in
another
half
hour
he
was
falling
and
fainting
letters
written
by
to
his
wife
and
gotten
hold
of
by
reporters
declared
that
at
this
juncture
passed
into
a
state
in
which
he
accused
himself
of
a
number
of
sins
and
volunteered
to
commit
suicide
so
that
the
others
would
not
be
burdened
by
his
weakness
also
that
they
might
use
his
body
to
fortify
themselves
discussed
with
the
advisability
of
taking
b
knife
away
from
him
living
on
their
carrier
pigeons
they
continued
on
moved
by
a
desperate
hope
of
finding
someone
had
several
fainting
spells
after
drinking
water
traced
by
moose
tracks
luck
favored
them
and
they
encountered
an
indian
who
guided
them
to
a
place
called
moose
factory
here
they
wrote
the
letters
home
which
reached
their
wives
and
the
daily
press
before
they
themselves
returned
to
civilization
a
great
hue
and
cry
was
raised
by
the
newspapers
about
their
plight
newspaper
correspondents
vied
with
each
other
for
the
honor
of
being
the
first
to
meet
them
and
get
their
story
they
arrived
at
a
collection
of
houses
named
mattice
and
proceeded
ahead
and
found
instructions
for
them
not
to
talk
went
back
to
who
was
in
a
shack
with
the
correspondents
full
of
the
story
of
the
letters
became
enraged
and
struck
who
retained
his
differences
were
patched
up
and
the
three
returned
together
to
new
york
there
the
medical
examination
of
the
three
showed
that
the
four
days
in
the
wilderness
had
left
its
deepest
effects
upon
the
physique
and
mind
of
b
in
a
few
days
he
developed
an
attack
of
tonsillitis
with
fever
and
a
mental
disturbance
described
by
the
medical
officer
as
exhaustion
psychosis
he
believed
this
condition
to
be
the
result
of
severe
exhaustion
prolonged
anxiety
worry
and
extreme
exposure
extreme
restlessness
and
irritability
confusion
of
thought
and
an
undefined
perplexity
all
the
prominent
symptoms
of
exhaustion
psychosis
making
him
hyperactive
and
inclined
to
acts
of
violence
were
in
evidence
the
physique
character
and
reactions
of
lieut
are
what
interest
us
in
the
case
the
pictures
of
him
published
and
the
structure
of
his
skull
face
and
teeth
his
hair
and
other
physical
traits
point
to
his
being
an
type
of
the
unstable
variety
so
far
as
his
internal
secretion
is
concerned
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
on
the
different
kinds
of
endocrine
personalities
the
unstable
adrenocentric
convenient
name
for
the
class
is
characterized
by
rapid
exhaustibility
because
under
conditions
of
stress
and
strain
the
reserve
of
the
gland
is
consumed
the
adrenal
glands
we
noted
in
a
preceding
chapter
are
concerned
with
the
maintenance
of
muscle
and
nerve
tone
in
emergencies
they
are
the
glands
which
during
crises
especially
control
the
production
and
supply
of
energy
to
the
various
organs
and
tissues
called
upon
to
function
to
the
utmost
in
emergencies
when
the
adrenals
fail
as
they
do
readily
in
these
labile
adrenocentrics
it
is
as
if
the
adrenals
were
cut
out
of
the
body
and
it
has
been
repeatedly
shown
that
extirpation
of
the
adrenals
is
immediately
followed
by
degeneration
and
breakdown
of
the
brain
cells
these
facts
explain
the
reactions
of
lieut
b
the
acute
call
upon
his
adrenals
made
by
his
dangerous
situation
probably
soon
exhausted
them
of
their
content
of
reserve
secretions
overwhelming
fatigue
with
loss
of
muscle
tone
followed
the
changes
in
the
brain
caused
him
to
talk
as
he
did
in
the
wilderness
returned
to
safety
the
news
that
his
reputation
was
under
fire
because
of
letter
brought
out
another
adrenal
characteristic
the
excessive
instinct
of
pugnacity
easily
stimulated
with
its
emotion
of
anger
and
the
tendency
to
violence
what
is
spoken
of
as
a
quick
temper
is
an
adrenocentric
trait
returned
to
new
york
an
infection
tonsillitis
attacked
him
infections
in
adrenocentrics
use
up
the
content
of
the
adrenals
as
rapidly
as
physical
exhaustion
or
emotion
so
the
tonsillitis
which
in
another
type
of
individual
would
have
been
combatted
continuously
by
the
adrenals
and
so
passed
by
as
a
mere
sore
throat
presented
him
with
a
high
temperature
and
the
brain
disturbance
described
by
the
medical
officer
as
with
again
a
tendency
to
violence
in
short
the
history
of
his
adventure
is
the
history
of
his
adrenals
under
stress
and
strain
it
illustrates
the
mechanism
of
a
typical
endocrine
neurosis
the
unconscious
and
the
viscera
in
the
chapter
on
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
as
an
interlocking
directorate
certain
generalities
were
stated
as
the
laws
of
the
government
of
the
organism
life
by
them
in
association
with
the
vegetative
apparatus
it
was
put
forward
as
a
fundamental
revision
of
the
theory
hitherto
accepted
of
the
limitation
of
mind
to
the
brain
cells
we
think
and
feel
not
alone
with
the
brain
but
with
our
muscles
our
viscera
our
vegetative
nerves
and
last
but
not
least
our
endocrine
organs
in
short
we
think
and
feel
with
each
and
every
part
of
ourselves
among
these
pristine
factors
determining
the
content
of
consciousness
the
endocrines
are
most
important
because
they
alone
to
start
with
of
all
the
other
factors
are
different
in
each
and
every
individual
they
are
what
render
him
unique
at
birth
even
though
he
looks
the
counterpart
of
millions
of
other
babies
born
at
the
same
time
they
constitute
his
inner
destiny
as
he
grows
the
external
factors
social
experiences
climate
accidents
and
disease
modify
and
condition
the
reactions
and
complexity
of
the
endocrine
system
as
these
modifications
and
associations
are
of
the
greatest
import
for
the
final
elaboration
of
the
personality
composing
as
they
do
the
elements
of
the
unconscious
which
confers
the
unique
stamp
of
normal
abnormal
supernormal
or
subnormal
it
is
worth
while
now
to
review
the
most
general
of
the
determining
laws
man
is
an
energy
phenomenon
both
conscious
and
unconscious
with
the
energy
emanating
from
the
mechanisms
so
it
becomes
possible
for
us
by
their
aid
to
analyze
the
conscious
the
subconscious
and
the
unconscious
with
the
terms
long
current
in
the
analyses
of
physics
man
is
an
energy
machine
which
though
it
is
constantly
losing
energy
as
a
whole
consists
of
parts
constantly
accumulating
energy
as
a
result
of
inherent
chemical
reactions
accelerated
by
the
absorption
of
food
this
process
of
local
accumulation
of
energy
associated
with
general
loss
of
energy
may
be
observed
even
in
the
ameba
in
the
form
of
stored
reserve
food
material
evolution
created
a
system
of
organs
the
viscera
as
specialists
in
energy
conservation
utilization
or
transformation
for
intercommunication
and
interaction
between
the
viscera
two
systems
were
elaborated
a
younger
system
of
direct
contacts
the
nerves
and
nerve
cells
through
which
influences
could
be
conducted
for
the
stimulation
acceleration
retardation
or
inhibition
of
an
energy
process
in
them
and
the
older
the
endocrine
gland
association
for
the
production
of
chemical
substances
to
act
as
messengers
to
be
sent
from
one
viscus
to
another
and
also
to
the
nerves
through
the
blood
or
lymph
which
bathe
all
the
cells
they
could
affect
only
one
or
certain
organs
because
by
selection
only
the
chosen
organ
or
organs
knew
the
code
as
it
were
the
chemical
system
is
much
the
older
system
and
preceded
the
nerve
system
by
aeons
of
time
the
whole
system
viscera
visceral
nerves
and
the
endocrines
gradually
united
into
a
complete
autonomous
organism
within
the
organism
and
as
such
functions
as
the
vegetative
apparatus
evolution
of
the
endocrines
in
the
course
of
evolution
variations
occurred
in
all
three
components
of
the
apparatus
the
viscera
the
nerves
and
the
endocrines
now
variations
in
the
viscera
and
the
nerves
are
essentially
grossly
physical
and
quantitative
that
is
there
may
be
a
bigger
stomach
or
a
smaller
stomach
larger
nerve
fibres
or
smaller
and
as
life
always
has
worked
with
a
large
margin
of
safety
and
always
played
for
safety
first
as
regards
quantity
these
variations
have
not
become
of
much
significance
for
the
history
and
destiny
of
the
animal
but
variations
among
the
endocrines
made
a
tremendous
difference
to
have
very
much
thyroid
and
very
little
pituitary
much
adrenal
and
not
enough
parathyroid
meant
a
great
deal
to
the
organism
as
a
whole
as
well
as
to
the
vegetative
apparatus
for
states
of
tension
and
relaxation
activity
and
inactivity
in
the
nerves
and
viscera
would
be
determined
by
these
variations
in
the
ratio
between
the
variants
the
vegetative
apparatus
in
its
virginity
say
in
the
infant
may
be
said
to
have
its
development
primarily
determined
by
the
reaction
potentials
of
the
endocrine
part
of
it
that
is
the
latent
power
of
each
gland
to
secrete
at
a
minimum
or
a
maximum
and
the
balance
between
them
education
of
the
vegetative
system
training
or
education
involves
beside
other
effects
a
training
of
the
endocrines
and
hence
of
the
entire
vegetative
apparatus
to
respond
in
a
particular
way
to
a
particular
stimulus
experience
is
like
the
introduction
of
new
levers
and
wheels
into
the
mechanism
all
learning
which
calls
out
or
arrests
the
functioning
of
an
instinct
must
from
what
we
have
learned
of
the
chemical
dynamics
of
instincts
as
reactions
between
hormones
nerves
and
viscera
affect
the
vegetative
system
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
two
or
more
instincts
between
pressures
of
energy
flowing
in
different
directions
there
may
be
compromise
and
normality
or
a
grinding
of
the
gears
and
abnormality
where
does
the
brain
come
in
in
all
this
as
the
servant
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
to
call
it
the
master
tissue
is
manifestly
absurd
when
it
can
only
be
the
diplomatic
constitutional
monarch
of
the
system
it
can
in
fact
act
only
as
the
great
central
station
for
associative
memory
as
only
one
of
the
factors
implicated
in
education
the
most
powerful
educative
agents
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
of
a
human
being
are
the
other
humans
around
him
and
they
comprise
the
most
powerful
of
the
external
effectors
of
education
for
better
for
worse
the
training
and
education
of
the
system
is
the
basis
of
all
social
rules
habit
custom
convention
law
conscience
an
unresolved
discord
a
continued
conflict
among
the
parts
of
the
vegetative
system
in
spite
of
such
education
is
the
foundation
of
the
unhappiness
of
the
acute
or
chronic
misfits
and
maladjusted
the
neurotic
and
the
psychotic
the
physical
basis
of
the
unconscious
another
vastly
important
law
that
governs
the
content
of
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
and
resultant
behaviour
is
the
fact
that
the
nerves
and
nerve
cells
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
the
nerves
leading
to
the
viscera
and
the
endocrine
glands
like
the
solar
plexus
are
affected
by
stimuli
of
lower
value
than
those
which
arouse
the
brain
cells
in
the
metaphorical
language
of
the
old
psychology
the
threshold
value
that
is
the
strength
or
loudness
of
stimulus
sufficient
to
make
itself
felt
or
heard
is
less
for
the
vegetative
apparatus
than
for
the
brain
so
we
begin
to
glimpse
why
an
emotion
seems
to
be
experienced
before
the
visceral
changes
that
really
preceded
it
but
pressed
their
way
into
consciousness
later
this
gives
us
a
clue
to
the
unconscious
as
the
more
sensitive
and
deeper
part
of
the
mind
more
than
that
it
supplies
us
with
a
physical
basis
for
the
unconscious
which
will
explain
much
of
the
observed
laws
of
its
workings
it
provides
a
reason
for
the
apparent
swiftness
spontaneity
and
unreasonableness
of
what
is
called
intuition
and
it
may
show
us
a
source
for
a
good
deal
of
the
material
of
dreams
and
dream
states
we
have
said
that
we
think
and
we
remember
not
alone
with
the
brain
but
with
the
muscles
the
viscera
and
the
endocrines
so
do
we
forget
not
alone
with
the
brain
but
with
the
muscles
the
viscera
the
endocrines
and
their
nerves
the
utmost
importance
of
muscle
attitudes
in
remembering
has
been
established
in
the
experimental
laboratory
it
is
one
of
the
great
services
freud
rendered
to
psychology
and
one
by
the
way
largely
responsible
for
the
acceptance
of
his
doctrines
by
the
disinterested
intelligence
that
he
showed
that
a
species
of
forgetting
is
nothing
casual
but
active
and
purposeful
a
manifestation
of
the
life
of
the
unconscious
however
though
his
description
of
the
process
was
correct
he
left
it
to
occur
in
a
vacuum
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
forgetting
consists
in
the
inhibition
of
associative
memory
by
a
process
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
so
as
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
within
itself
which
is
reflected
in
consciousness
as
comfort
the
unconscious
in
short
consists
of
the
buried
associations
among
the
parts
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
and
the
brain
cells
we
seem
to
be
much
nearer
to
grasping
the
nature
of
the
unconscious
when
we
look
upon
it
as
a
historical
continuum
a
compound
or
emulsion
of
different
and
various
states
of
intravisceral
pressure
and
tone
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
dependent
upon
the
balance
between
the
endocrines
as
well
as
upon
past
experiences
of
the
viscera
in
the
way
of
stimulation
or
depression
we
forget
that
which
is
held
down
literally
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
this
explanation
of
forgetting
tells
too
why
the
forgotten
stored
in
the
the
system
continually
projects
itself
into
and
interferes
with
the
regular
flow
of
consciousness
in
slips
of
the
tongue
mistakes
of
spelling
and
so
on
because
the
energy
bottled
in
the
vegetative
system
tends
to
erupt
into
the
consciousness
into
which
it
would
ordinarily
flow
in
the
evolution
of
the
mind
there
have
been
elaborated
devices
to
protect
it
against
the
vegetative
apparatus
consciousness
or
awareness
must
be
accepted
as
a
fundamental
primal
fact
like
protoplasm
consciousness
and
protoplasm
may
be
the
complementary
sides
of
the
same
coin
whatever
the
truth
the
fact
stands
out
that
the
oldest
deepest
most
potent
consciousness
is
that
of
the
traditionally
despised
lowest
organs
the
vegetative
organs
the
heart
and
lungs
stomach
and
intestines
the
kidneys
and
the
liver
and
so
on
their
nerves
the
solar
plexus
and
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
they
invented
and
elaborated
muscle
bone
and
brain
to
carry
out
their
will
evolution
has
been
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
perfection
of
the
methods
of
carrying
out
their
will
their
consciousness
working
upon
the
growing
and
multiplying
brain
cells
has
created
what
we
call
mind
mind
reacting
upon
its
creator
has
in
a
sense
come
to
dominate
them
because
it
has
become
the
meeting
ground
of
all
the
seething
and
bubbling
in
the
organism
and
so
developed
into
the
organ
of
handling
them
as
a
whole
their
but
just
the
same
and
all
the
time
the
underlying
consciousness
of
the
viscera
and
their
accessories
stand
as
the
powers
behind
the
throne
but
as
what
we
have
now
learned
to
speak
of
in
relation
to
the
mind
as
the
unconscious
psychopathology
of
everyday
life
to
sum
up
these
relations
of
the
viscera
the
endocrines
the
unconscious
and
the
mind
it
may
be
stated
as
a
generality
for
the
understanding
of
human
life
that
character
and
conduct
are
expressions
of
the
streams
of
energy
arising
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
primarily
endocrine
determined
at
birth
and
secondarily
experience
determined
after
the
organism
has
learned
to
react
as
a
whole
as
consciousness
the
result
of
such
a
reaction
as
a
whole
tends
to
balance
the
disturbance
of
energy
so
as
to
maintain
or
restore
the
equilibrium
or
sense
of
harmony
and
comfort
when
consciousness
again
disappears
this
law
is
an
attempt
at
synthesis
of
the
labors
of
the
psychanalysts
the
behaviourists
and
the
students
of
the
internal
secretions
freud
jung
adler
sherrington
watson
von
bechterew
kempf
crile
cannon
cushing
fraenkel
are
the
great
names
of
the
movement
most
of
the
details
and
all
of
the
quantitative
applications
of
the
law
still
remain
to
be
worked
out
but
a
statement
like
the
following
of
cushing
the
eminent
of
the
endocrines
that
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
psychopathology
of
everyday
life
hinges
largely
upon
the
effect
of
ductless
gland
discharges
upon
the
nervous
system
shows
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
in
the
face
of
these
conceptions
the
position
of
the
psychanalyst
as
a
practical
therapeutist
becomes
clearer
and
the
causes
of
his
failure
when
he
fails
in
the
first
place
he
deals
with
psychic
results
as
processes
and
ignores
the
physiology
of
their
production
since
a
true
cure
of
the
neurosis
what
he
is
after
is
impossible
without
a
removal
of
the
cause
a
disturbance
in
the
vegetative
apparatus
he
can
not
succeed
where
an
automatic
adjustment
among
the
viscera
does
not
follow
his
probings
and
ferretings
of
the
unconscious
in
the
second
place
he
disregards
the
existence
of
a
soil
for
the
planting
of
the
malign
complexes
in
the
individual
in
whom
they
grow
and
flourish
that
soil
is
composed
in
part
of
the
endocrine
relations
within
the
vegetative
apparatus
and
as
we
can
often
attack
that
soil
more
effectively
and
radically
from
the
endocrine
end
than
from
the
experience
end
repressed
episodes
we
may
transform
the
soil
and
make
it
barren
rock
for
morbid
complexes
at
any
rate
the
concept
of
the
apparatus
as
the
determinant
of
normal
and
abnormal
behaviour
emotional
reactions
and
disturbances
of
power
should
in
time
cause
even
the
most
fanatic
of
the
psychanalysts
to
recognize
the
functional
basis
of
the
mental
acrostics
they
are
so
fond
of
dissecting
natural
ability
another
achievement
of
the
psychanalysts
is
the
recognition
of
the
influence
of
organic
and
functional
inferiorities
of
the
individual
upon
the
history
of
his
personality
gross
organ
inferiorities
are
those
which
are
definite
handicaps
in
the
struggle
for
success
in
society
such
as
heart
disease
such
handicaps
however
are
limited
to
relatively
few
of
a
population
the
raison
of
the
greater
number
of
minor
mental
inefficiencies
the
psychanalyst
puts
down
to
handicaps
in
the
unconscious
again
he
mistakes
figurative
imagery
for
explanations
the
conception
of
endocrine
diversity
in
the
supplies
us
with
the
rationale
of
the
vast
majority
of
organic
and
functional
defects
and
inferiorities
in
short
subnormalities
of
any
group
large
or
small
moreover
how
would
the
psychanalyst
explain
the
occurrence
and
influence
of
organic
and
functional
and
their
tremendous
influence
upon
the
individual
and
society
we
live
in
a
generation
which
has
acquired
a
flair
for
the
pathologic
undoubtedly
it
is
a
generation
and
its
interest
in
sickness
of
the
mind
is
only
natural
just
the
same
whatever
advances
improvements
progress
have
been
made
and
certainly
a
number
of
the
changes
in
his
environment
external
and
internal
must
be
admitted
to
be
changes
for
the
better
have
been
made
not
by
natural
disability
but
by
natural
ability
what
is
the
physiology
of
natural
ability
the
finest
study
of
natural
ability
that
has
as
yet
been
composed
is
francis
galton
on
hereditary
genius
it
also
remains
the
best
study
of
the
natural
conditions
of
success
he
showed
that
of
the
type
of
man
he
classed
as
illustrious
there
occurred
about
one
in
a
million
and
of
the
type
eminent
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
a
million
of
the
qualities
which
determine
natural
ability
of
this
kind
he
selected
inherent
capacity
zeal
and
perseverance
as
the
three
prerequisites
and
he
states
that
if
a
man
is
gifted
with
vast
intellectual
ability
eagerness
to
work
and
power
of
working
i
can
not
comprehend
how
such
a
man
should
be
suppressed
such
men
those
who
have
gained
great
reputations
biographies
show
to
be
haunted
and
driven
by
an
incessant
instinctive
craving
for
intellectual
work
they
work
to
satisfy
a
natural
craving
for
brain
work
it
is
very
unlikely
that
any
conjunction
of
circumstances
should
supply
a
stimulus
to
brain
work
commensurate
with
what
these
men
carry
in
their
own
constitutions
what
is
this
inherent
craving
for
brain
work
what
is
this
zeal
and
what
is
power
of
endurance
and
perseverance
the
quality
of
stamina
how
are
they
to
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
the
internal
secretions
in
view
of
what
has
been
said
of
the
as
the
gland
of
intellectuality
studies
of
intellectually
gifted
people
having
shown
well
functioning
large
pituitaries
and
of
mental
defectives
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
a
small
limited
pituitary
it
is
justifiable
to
regard
the
factor
of
inherent
capacity
as
a
function
of
the
the
factor
of
zeal
or
enthusiasm
points
to
the
thyroid
markedly
enthusiastic
types
are
thyroid
dominant
types
vigor
as
a
third
factor
the
ability
to
stand
stress
and
strain
of
continued
effort
is
dependent
upon
good
adrenal
and
interstitial
cell
function
so
we
may
say
that
craving
and
capacity
for
brain
work
plus
ardor
plus
perseverance
in
its
pursuit
the
triplicate
of
natural
ability
are
the
reflections
in
conduct
and
character
of
balanced
and
sufficient
thyroid
and
contributions
in
the
chemical
formula
of
the
personality
in
the
chapter
on
historic
personages
analyzed
from
the
endocrine
viewpoint
we
shall
see
that
some
of
the
most
eminent
and
illustrious
people
of
history
have
been
mental
deficiency
natural
ability
grows
in
an
endocrine
soil
of
a
particular
kind
perhaps
affected
by
the
internal
secretions
much
as
natural
soil
is
by
fertilizers
like
phosphates
or
nitrates
increased
production
follows
increased
fertilization
natural
disability
must
vary
similarly
with
a
perversion
or
improper
mixture
deficiency
or
absence
of
the
hormones
that
combine
in
natural
ability
it
is
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
brain
itself
is
there
which
to
carry
out
our
analogy
means
that
the
crude
soil
or
earth
is
there
sufficient
quantity
and
adequate
quality
of
nerve
tissue
must
be
regarded
as
prerequisite
if
the
brain
has
been
damaged
in
any
way
during
development
or
birth
if
it
has
been
smashed
up
in
any
way
or
if
it
has
failed
to
evolve
the
minimum
number
of
healthy
nerve
cells
the
endocrine
influence
becomes
negligible
it
is
like
attempting
to
insert
a
key
into
a
door
which
has
no
lock
it
is
among
the
specimens
of
normality
of
the
brain
cells
that
we
may
look
for
our
examples
of
endocrine
mental
deficiency
included
are
all
sorts
of
examples
of
varying
from
the
moron
to
the
imbecile
and
idiot
arrested

the
cretin
is
the
classic
type
of
mental
deficiency
due
to
endocrine
insufficiency
curable
or
improvable
by
the
proper
handling
insanity
degeneration
of
the
normal
brain
life
may
be
caused
by
an
upset
of
the
endocrine
balance
among
the
commonest
manifestations
of
insanity
are
excitements
and
depressions
apathies
and
manias
hallucinations
delusions
and
obsessions
all
of
which
are
reproducible
under
known
conditions
of
internal
secretion
excess
or
failure
alternating
states
of
mania
and
depression
are
caused
in
some
instances
by
extreme
hyperthyroidism
the
critical
periods
of
life
when
a
profound
revolution
is
overturning
the
endocrine
equilibrium
puberty

and
the
menopause
are
the
periods
of
most
frequent
occurrence
of
insanity
when
mental
instability
reveals

instability
dementia
praecox

not

never

they

more
or
less

to
the
borderline
of

as
persons
who
have
spells
eccentricities
and
peculiarities
hysteria
tics
or
just
nervousness
about
of
mental
deficiency
is
definitely
inherited
about
acquired
it
is
the
opinion
of
a
number
of
psychologists
that
it
is
inherited
as
what
the
mendelians
call
a
recessive
that
is
as
a
trait
which
will
be
overshadowed
if
there
is
admixture
of
normal
mentality
but
will
crop
up
by
breeding
with
another
mental
defective
what
we
know
of
the
endocrine
factors
in
heredity
leads
us
to
suppose
that
it
is
the
mating
of
one
marked
endocrine
insufficiency
with
another
that
is
often
responsible
for
the
inherited
tendency
to
and
insanity
the
effect
of
the
hormone
system
upon
the
vegetative
apparatus
may
create
the
more
obscure
insanities
and
the
direct
action
of
the
internal
secretions
upon
the
brain
cells
producing
a
sort
of
hair
trigger
situation
within
them
may
cause
the
explosive
discharges
from
them
which
appear
as
overpowering
impulses
or
uncontrollable
conduct
the
waves
of
feeling
which
precede
them
are
unquestionably
endocrine
determined
the
wave
of
fear
a
cat
experiences
upon
seeing
a
dog
is
accompanied
and
indeed
preceded
by
an
increase
of
the
amount
of
adrenalin
in
the
blood
the
picture
of
fright
as
observed
in
a
normal
person
staring
eyes
trembling
hands
dry
lips
and
mouth
corresponds
to
the
portrait
of
the
appearance
in
hyperthyroidism
in
persons
afflicted
with
uncontrollable
impulses
the
inhibiting
hormones
may
not
be
present
in
sufficient
quantity
ranging
from
stupidity
to
imbecility
may
also
be
a
direct
effect
of
insufficient
endocrine
supply
to
the
brain
cells
when
there
is
not
enough
of
the
thyroid
secretion
in
the
blood
the
tissue
between
the
cells
in
the
brain
become
clogged
and
thickened
so
that
a
gross
barrier
to
the
passage
of
the
nerve
impulses
is
created
we
have
here
an
illustration
of
internal
secretion
lack
actually
producing
gross
changes
in
the
brain
but
without
a
doubt
most
endocrine
influences
upon
the
brain
at
work
every
minute
and
second
of
its
life
are
the
subtle
ones
of
molecular
chemistry
and
atomic
energetics
we
know
that
such
mental
qualities
as
irritability
and
stupidity
fatigability
and
the
power
to
recover
quickly
or
slowly
from
fatigue
sexual
potency
and
impotence
apathy
and
enthusiasm
are
endocrine
qualities
we
know
also
that
the
thyroid
dominant
tends
to
be
irritable
and
excitable
the
pituitary
deficient
to
be
placid
and
gentle
the
adrenal
dominant
to
be
assertive
and
pugnacious
the
to
be
childish
and
and
the
gonad
deficient
to
be
secretive
and
shy
this
brings
us
to
the
relation
of
the
internal
secretions
to
the
type
of
personality
as
a
whole
chapter
x
the
types
of
personality
the
endocrine
personality
if
a
single
gland
can
dominate
the
life
history
of
an
individual
it
becomes
possible
to
speak
of
the
result
of
the
of
the
individual
studying
endocrine
traits
of
physique
life
reactions
disease
tendencies
hereditary
history
and
blood
chemistry
one
may
gain
an
insight
into
the
composition
or
constitution
of
an
individual
the
endocrine
type
of
an
individual
is
a
summary
of
these
his
behaviour
in
the
past
and
is
also
a
prediction
of
his
reactions
in
the
future
much
as
a
chemical
formula
outlines
what
we
believe
to
be
the
skeleton
of
a
compound
substance
as
deducible
from
its
properties
under
varying
conditions
only
admittedly
as
yet
the
endocrine
label
is
but
roughly
qualitative
and
most
crudely
quantitative
whereas
the
chemical
formula
is
the
essence
of
the
exact
however
the
fact
remains
that
though
we
are
only
upon
the
first
rungs
of
the
ladder
we
are
upon
the
ladder
the
horizon
undoubtedly
broadens
we
possess
a
new
way
of
looking
upon
humanity
a
fresh
transforming
light
upon
those
strange
phenomena
ourselves
of
the
ugly
achievements
of
that
dreadful
century
the
nineteenth
the
most
illuminating
was
the
discovery
of
itself
as
the
yes
we
are
all
animals
now
it
said
to
itself
and
set
its
teeth
in
the
game
of
survival
but
there
was
no
understanding
in
that
evil
motto
of
a
disillusioned
heart
the
desperately
lonely
and
secretive
has
still
to
understand
himself
let
us
be
clear
if
we
can
there
is
perhaps
a
certain
presumption
in
the
phrase
the
endocrine
type
it
is
ambitious
and
perhaps
will
not
fulfill
its
promise
but
it
is
useful
because
it
points
a
parallel
and
an
ideal
as
wilhelm
ostwald
never
tired
of
repeating
o
is
a
complete
shorthand
record
for
the
bundle
of
qualities
commonly
known
as
water
it
is
an
example
of
that
highest
task
of
mind
synthesis
it
is
the
highest
synthesis
of
the
studies
of
the
internal
secretions
that
certain
combinations
of
them
permutations
and
blendings
of
them
are
responsible
for
those
unique
wonders
of
the
universe
personalities
the
riddle
of
personality
are
we
at
last
upon
the
track
of
its
uncovering
that
elusive
mystery
which
philosophers
have
wrapped
in
the
thousand
veils
of
greek
and
latin
words
and
psychologists
even
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
freudians
have
floundered
about
in
moles
before
a
dazzling
sun
is
it
to
be
unwound
for
our
inspection
think
of
the
human
soul
what
an
invisible
intangible
chameleon
is
its
true
reality
watch
it
and
you
see
something
that
seems
to
uncurl
and
expand
like
a
feather
with
exultation
and
delight
and
joy
to
contract
and
stiffen
into
a
billiard
ball
with
fear
and
pride
shrewd
caution
and
vigilant
malevolence
to
rear
back
and
spark
fire
like
lightning
with
anger
and
temper
and
to
crawl
and
slither
with
abjection
and
smirking
slyness
when
it
needs
to
this
multiplex
are
we
really
about
to
dissect
it
into
its
elements
personality
embraces
much
more
than
merely
the
psychic
attributes
it
is
not
the
least
important
of
the
lessons
of
endocrine
analysis
that
there
is
no
soul
and
no
body
either
rather
a
or
or
the
patterns
of
the
living
flame
the
closer
tracking
of
the
internal
secretions
leads
us
into
the
secrets
of
the
living
flame
why
it
lives
and
how
it
lives
the
strange
diversities
of
its
colorings
and
music
and
the
odd
variations
in
its
energy
vitality
and
longevity
why
it
flickers
why
it
flares
and
glares
spurts
flutters
burns
hard
or
soft
or
yellow
the
medieval
scholiasts
who
fought
as
fiercely
about
names
as
nations
about
territories
divided
men
into
the
sanguine
the
bilious
the
lymphatic
and
the
nervous
it
was
a
pretty
crude
classification
of
different
constitutions
the
endocrine
criteria
more
exact
and
concrete
divide
them
into
the
adrenal
centered
the
thyroid
centered
the
thymus
centered
the
pituitary
centered
the
gonad
centered
and
their
combinations
the
adrenal
personalities
an
adrenal
personality
is
one
dominated
by
the
ups
and
downs
of
his
adrenal
gland
in
the
large
the
curve
of
his
life
is
the
curve
of
secretion
by
this
gland
both
of
its
cortex
and
medulla
such
an
adrenal
personality
is
entirely
normal
within
the
definition
of
the
normal
as
something
not
threatening
the
duration
of
life
nor
comfortable
adaptation
to
it
so
are
the
other
glandular
types
no
sharp
line
can
be
drawn
between
the
normal
and
the
abnormal
in
any
case
the
borderland
is
wide
the
transitions
many
the
skin
is
one
of
the
chief
clues
to
the
adrenal
personality
the
relation
between
the
adrenal
and
the
skin
dates
way
back
in
the
evolutionary
scale
for
adrenalin
has
been
isolated
directly
from
pigment
deposits
in
the
epidermis
of
frogs
skin
pigment
bears
a
direct
relation
to
the
reaction
of
the
organism
to
light
especially
the
ultraviolet
rays
to
the
radiation
of
heat
and
hence
to
the
fundamental
productions
and
consumptions
of
energy
by
the
cells
so
the
gland
of
energy
for
emergencies
writes
its
signature
always
all
over
the
skin
in
an
adrenal
personality
the
epidermis
is
always
slightly
somewhat
or
deeply
pigmented
the
pigmentation
is
due
to
a
dark
brown
deposit
lightly
or
thickly
scattered
over
the
skin
with
the
general
diffuse
pigmentation
or
darkening
there
are
often
the
black
spots
the
pigmented
birth
marks
or
the
lighter
ones
of
freckles
the
latter
signify
some
permanent
or
transitory
adrenal
inadequacy
in
the
past
or
of
the
individual
and
presage
the
same
in
his
future
these
spots
have
been
frequently
observed
to
appear
after
an
attack
of
diphtheria
or
influenza
there
seems
to
be
more
tuberculosis
among
those
who
have
them
than
those
who
do
not
we
therefore
say
that
diphtheria
influenza
and
tuberculosis
stand
out
as
diseases
which
have
a
greater
power
to
kill
cripple
or
hurt
those
with
defective
adrenal
constitutions
than
others
the
hair
of
the
adrenal
type
is
characteristic
ubiquitous
thick
coarse
and
dry
it
is
prominent
over
the
chest
abdomen
and
back
and
has
a
tendency
to
kink
often
its
color
is
not
the
expected
an
italian
will
be
yellow
a
norwegian
jet
black
it
has
been
stated
that
most
persons
are
adrenal
types
such
persons
also
have
canine
teeth
which
is
another
adrenal
trait
they
also
have
a
low
hair
line
when
the
adrenal
type
has
a
properly
pituitary
and
thyroid
he
possesses
a
striking
vigor
energy
and
persistence
with
a
fortunate
combination
he
develops
into
a
progressive
winning
fighter
arriving
at
the
top
in
the
long
run
every
time
brain
work
is
pretty
well
lubricated
in
the
adrenal

closely
associated
with
if
not
dependent
upon
adrenal
fag
particularly
of
the
cortex
brain
tissue
and
adrenal
cortex
tissue
are
near
relatives
and
a
normal
human
brain
never
develops
without
a
normal
adrenal
cortex
the
adrenal
type
with
an
hypertrophied
adrenal
cortex
is
always
efficient
among
women
the
adrenal
type
is
always
masculinoid
if
physically
feminine
due
to
adequate
feminine
reactions
on
the
part
of
the
other
endocrines
she
will
at
least
show
the
qualities
of
a
psychic
virilism
a
generation
ago
such
a
woman
had
to
repress
her
inherent
trends
and
instincts
in
the
face
of
public
opinion
and
law
and
so
suffered
from
a
feeling
of
inferiority
nowadays
these
women
are
striding
forward
and
will
attain
a
good
many
of
the
masculine
heights
commanding
responsible
executive
positions
and
high
salaries
an
adrenal
type
will
probably
be
the
first
woman
president
of
the
united
states
however
that
presupposes
a
normal
range
of
action
of
the
other
endocrines
let
there
be
some
quirk
or
weakness
elsewhere
in
the
chain
of
hormones
and
instead
of
the
successful
woman
behold
the
spinsters
the
maiden
aunts
the
prudes
and
cranks
who
never
satisfactorily
adapt
themselves
in
society
to
them
must
be
given
a
good
deal
of
credit
for
the
suffrage
revolution
these
unadapted
adrenals
as
we
may
call
them
once
sowed
the
seeds
expending
their
masculinism
in
the
struggles
of
the
pioneers
martyrdoms
preparing
the
harvest
their
sisters
the
more
adequate
adrenal
types
will
now
reap
the
unadapted
adrenals
of
today
will
have
to
look
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
so
much
for
the
compensated
adrenal
types
they
are
the
good
workers
the
efficients
the
kinetic
successes
of
the
driven
world
they
make
at
a
certain
level
good
slave
drivers
because
they
feel
within
themselves
a
driving
force
but
suppose
the
adrenal
type
becomes
uncompensated
or
perhaps
is
inadequate
to
the
demands
of
life
to
start
with
then
the
story
becomes
different
the
perfect
efficient
superman
of
business
or
profession
begins
to
lag
though
he
is
himself
in
the
morning
he
begins
to
lag
in
the
afternoon
that
is
when
he
tires
in
the
evening
he
is
all
in
more
sleep
recreational
trips
vacations
slip
into
the
rank
of
necessities
whereas
previously
they
had
been
laughed
at
as
luxuries
more
minute
or
large
moles
emerge
in
the
skin
especially
if
the
individual
is
of
a
fair
type
if
a
strenuous
effort
is
not
made
to
give
the
adrenals
an
opportunity
to
recuperate
or
if
adjustment
on
the
part
of
the
other
glands
does
not
occur
this
stage
of
intermittent
and
remittent
adrenal
inadequacy
gives
way
in
turn
to
the
state
of
permanent
adrenal
insufficiency
the
adrenal
insufficient
is
important
because
he
is
to
be
seen
everywhere
built
along
the
same
lines
as
the
adrenal
adequate
and
apt
to
be
taken
for
him
he
differs
and
contrasts
vividly
below
the
surface
one
may
sum
him
up
by
saying
that
he
is
one
variety
of
neurasthenic
perhaps
the
most
frequent
variety
cold
hands
and
feet
plague
him
cold
feet
psychically
as
well
as
physically
for
a
chronic
and
obsessive
indecision
is
one
of
his
most
prominent
complaints
a
fatigability
that
goes
with
a
low
blood
pressure
lowered
body
temperature
and
a
disturbed
ability
to
utilize
sugar
for
fuel
purposes
is
another
of
his
chief
complaints
the
skin
often
presents
an
instability
of
the
blood
vessels
so
that
they
now
react
to
stroking
with
a
blanched
instead
of
a
reddened
effect
irritability
a
liability
to
go
off
the
handle
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
a
consequent
complete
exhaustion
that
after
an
outburst
sends
him
to
bed
is
conspicuous
dismissed
sometimes
contemptuously
as
weaklings
they
are
accused
of
laziness
craziness
and
haziness
in
their
psychic
attempts
to
compensate
they
land
into
all
kinds
of
hot
water
from
which
friends
relatives
or
luck
extricate
them
sometimes
the
other
times
they
go
to
the
wall
the
congenital
adrenal
deficient
is
a
special
problem
if
the
history
of
such
an
individual
is
followed
from
birth
one
gets
a
pretty
typical
story
the
genealogy
is
nervous
nervous
is
a
word
of
many
meanings
but
when
parents
confess
themselves
nervous
it
generally
means
a
mental
and
emotional
instability
of
some
sort
sometimes
the
idea
is
camouflaged
as
high
strung
in
the
feeding
narrative
of
the
child
one
finds
not
occasional
incidents
or
episodes
but
continued
trouble
difficulties
adventures
even
after
the
first
year
or
two
the
nutritional
chronicle
is
not
satisfactory
lack
of
appetite
lack
of
energy
lack
of
response
to
stimuli
are
its
keynotes
and
the
motifs
of
the
later
years
of
childhood
growth
is
a
strain
it
becomes
a
task
to
make
these
children
grow
and
gain
chronically
below
the
average
weight
and
height
herculean
efforts
are
made
by
the
conscientious
parents
but
with
small
success
with
the
entry
of
school
life
and
competition
the
curtain
rises
upon
the
real
tragedy
a
tragedy
in
which
the
avenging
fates
are
the
usual
ignorance
stupidity
and
misunderstanding
if
the
teachers
alone
are
or
perhaps
sadistic
the
child
endures
the
agonies
of
repeated
admonitions
demotions
and
punishments
however
a
certain
indifference
may
develop
to
protect
the
sufferer
if
the
parents
are
in
addition
ambitious
or
proud
or
competitive
then
woe
betide
the
victim
with
their
nervous
dispositions
it
is
the
school
and
the
tutor
who
are
to
be
blamed
if
not
the
child
from
school
to
school
from
system
to
system
from
novelty
to
fad
from
doctor
to
doctor
from
fakir
to
charlatan
from
pillar
to
post
they
wander
in
search
of
an
education
educational
cults
by
the
dozen
have
sprouted
and
grown
fat
around
these
unfortunates
the
chief
defect
of
the
congenital
adrenal
inadequate
is
an
insufficiently
developed
adrenal
cortex
that
means
an
insufficiently
developed
brain
and
nervous
system
for
we
have
seen
how
closely
all
these
are
related
in
development
now
education
can
never
be
the
education
of
a
vacuum
and
we
have
to
deal
here
with
a
relative
vacuum
when
there
are
no
potentialities
there
can
be
no
education
where
the
potentialities
are
limited
education
must
be
limited
the
congenital
adrenal
inadequate
is
defined
in
physical
and
mental
energy
hence
educators
can
not
drive
him
up
to
a
certain
point
he
can
be
led
but
no
farther
he
should
not
be
expected
to
go
to
a
college
and
waste
the
opportunity
of
some
one
financially
unlucky
but
whose
endocrine
system
is
more
generously
endowed
not
that
the
outlook
is
absolutely
hopeless
puberty
with
its
tremendous
changes
in
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
when
one
can
almost
hear
the
clicks
and
the
whirring
of
the
wheels
in
the
internal
machinery
may
transform
the
unfathomed
possibilities
of
gland
therapy
are
still
to
be
probed
but
the
general
rule
remains
the
reactions
to
modernism
the
adrenal
personalities
in
all
their
variations
must
be
safeguarded
and
carefully
looked
after
in
the
strained
complexities
of
modern
civilization
in
a
sense
the
adrenal
type
is
the
atlas
of
the
twentieth
century
world
and
small
wonder
that
he
and
his
descendants
stagger
beneath
the
burden
the
adrenals
are
organs
for
the
mobilization
of
energy
physical
and
mental
for
emergencies
they
are
the
glands
which
meet
shocks
and
neutralize
the
effects
of
shock
in
the
solitary
animal
the
everyday
producers
of
shock
are
pain
fright
and
wounds
the
adrenal
mechanisms
oversecrete
to
encounter
the
enemy
and
then
there
is
a
period
of
rest
and
recuperation
man
however
with
the
growth
of
his
imagination
and
the
increase
in
number
and
density
of
his
surrounding
herd
has
become
the
subject
of
continuous
stimulation
in
the
past
this
was
balanced
by
the
almost
universal
dominance
of
some
religious
belief
as
an
effective
opiate
concepts
like
fate
predestination
an
and
providence
relieved
and
shielded
the
adrenals
and
acted
as
valuable
adjuvants
for
the
preservation
of
normality
the
nineteenth
century
witnessed
the
birth
and
expansion
of
a
great
number
of
new
stimulant
reagents
the
discoveries
of
physics
and
chemistry
which
with
the
climax
of
the
world
war
of
have
made
for
a
more
or
less
complete
deliquescence
of
accepted
religion
for
the
great
majority
there
was
no
faith
to
take
its
place
war
and
shocks
have
continued
with
their
incessant
pounding
upon
the
reserves
of
energy
under
these
conditions
the
adrenal
personalities
are
bound
to
suffer
the
other
endocrine
types
suffer
too
but
quite
differently
today
ideas
are
epidemic
of
these
first
prize
belongs
to
a
cult
of
egotism
fathered
by
the
napoleonic
idea
consciously
assertive
and
in
max
the
ego
and
his
own
which
engendered
a
swarm
of
imitators
and
plagiarists
human
beings
are
all
incorrigible
egoists
more
or
less
furtive
or
frank
but
social
and
religious
codes
curbed
the
most
narcissistic
of
kings
and
conquerors
before
napoleon
all
of
them
vowed
allegiance
and
expressed
submission
to
some
sort
of
deity
confessed
some
fear
of
the
lord
in
their
hearts
but
the
ideas
of
napoleon
flouted
all
that
the
unscrupulous
predatory
who
put
effectual
scheming
for
the
self
plainly
above
every
other
consideration
and
rode
rough
shod
over
all
his
fellows
appealed
powerfully
to
the
latent
animality
of
the
adrenal
types
then
came
the
dawning
awareness
of
capital
and
labor
of
themselves
as
classes
fiercely
opposed
forever
in
the
policy
of

the
labor
organizations
and
the
commercial
companies
and
corporations
pitted
themselves
against
each
other
consciously
doctrines
like

everyone
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
the
iron
law
of

and
the
facts
is
facts
of
the

were
the
phrases
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
assisted
finally
came
the
darwinian
revelation
of
man
as
the
which
completed
the
disintegration
of
the
old
restraints
man
seemed
to
see
himself
now
for
the
first
time
stark
and
naked
but
man
consists
of
many
varieties
and
all
reacted
differently
to
the
image
in
the
clouded
mirror
there
was
universal
attempt
at
suppression
but
slowly
the
forces
infiltrated
every
activity
and
every
soul
like
a
hidden
focus
of
infection
in
the
body
it
germinated
and
poisoned
a
slow
fever
crept
into
life
a
febrile
quality
tinged
the
acquisition
of
wealth
the
concentration
upon
sex
and
the
desperate
pursuit
of
the
novel
stimulus
then
like
the
hand
that
appeared
at
belshazzar
feast
came
the
war
only
it
was
a
hand
that
stayed
with
a
long
flashing
lightning
sword
in
its
grip
sweeping
pitilessly
among
the
erstwhile
dancing
multitudes
to
mutilate
and
destroy
a
good
many
people
with
that
sturdy
animality
george
santayana
speaks
somewhere
of
as
a
trait
of
mankind
set
out
to
enjoy
the
war
it
was
a
new
sort
of
good
time
upon
an
incredibly
large
scale
it
was
an
opportunity
the
mechanisms
of
suppression
of
the
mind
render
it
incapable
of
appreciating
horror
until
encountered
and
so
thousands
with
dangerously
unstable
adrenals
were
plunged
into
the
most
trying
conditions
possible
hundreds
of
them
already
shaken
on
the
borderland
of
instability
reacted
with
the
phenomena
of
breakdown
of
control
lumped
with
a
host
of
other
phenomena
under
the
general
rubric
of
shell
shock
that
alone
was
not
all
if
hundreds
collapsed
thousands
approached
the
verge
of
collapse
they
survived
and
were
discharged
from
the
armies
as
normal
they
reappear
in
civil
life
as
cases
of
nerves
ordinarily
that
would
mean
that
they
would
be
classed
as
failures
but
such
have
been
the
psychologic
reactions
to
the
war
that
all
kinds
of
compensations
in
the
way
of
dangerous
mental
states
have
become
frequent
in
these
inadequate
adrenal
types
a
trend
to
violence
and
a
resentful
emotionalism
are
combined
with
desperate
attempts
to
spur
the
jaded
adrenals
with
artificial
excitements
consequent
melancholia
and
depression
the
blues
are
inevitable
a
survey
of
drug
addicts
would
probably
show
a
definite
percentage
of
this
type
the
same
applies
to
certain
petty
criminals
and
law
breakers
the
adrenal
element
in
the
personality
must
be
considered
in
every
disturbance
morbid
personal
or
social
involving
brunette
types
huxley
dark
white
persons
and
even
fair
people
historians
have
traced
the
earliest
civilization
to
the
doings
of
a
brunette
people
the
sumerians
the
first
to
build
cities
in
the
region
more
than
five
thousand
years
before
christ
was
born
an
adrenalized
people
one
would
expect
to
be
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
possibilities
because
of
their
energy
capacity
the
earliest
sumerian
stone
carvings
of
warriors
exhibit
an
undersized
skeleton
compared
with
the
large
head
broad
face
a
low
hair
line
and
prominent
nose
that
would
fit
into
the
ensemble
of
the
adrenal
type
certain
other
historical
aspects
of
the
adrenal
personality
have
yet
to
be
worked
out
the
pituitary
personalities
the
presence
of
two
antagonistic
elements
in
the
one
gland
complicates
any
attempt
at
even
the
most
abstract
analysis
of
a
personality
dominated
by
that
gland
the
pituitary
composed
of
an
anterior
lobe
and
posterior
lobe
supplies
two
fairly
uncomplicated
corresponding
types
best
described
as
the
masculine
pituitary
type
and
the
feminine
pituitary
type
the
masculine
pituitary
type
is
one
determined
by
the
rule
of
the
anterior
pituitary
representing
superlative
brain
tone
and
action
good
growth
and
harmonious
general
function
the
ideal
masculine
organism
the
feminine
pituitary
type
has
an
excess
of
with
susceptibility
to
the
tender
emotions
sentimentalism
and
emotionalism
feminine
structural
lines
dominance
in
a
male
reinforces
the
general
masculinity
while
the
depresses
it
the
in
a
woman
augments
her
natural
trend
tending
to
counteract
it
in
other
words
and
ovary
are
conjunctive
and
ovary
are
disjunctive
and
testis
are
opponents
and
testis
are
allies
one
mechanical
circumstance
involved
in
the
pituitary
personalities
may
be
the
determinant
of
the
entire
life
history
that
is
the
emphasized
fact
that
the
pituitary
is
encased
in
a
small
bony
box
at
the
base
of
the
skull
the
size
of
this
bony
box
and
its
capacity
to
yield
to
the
various
pressures
of
a
pituitary
enlarging
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
organism
will
often
spell
happiness
or
misery
success
or
failure
genius
or
idiocy
for
the
man
or
woman
certain
possibilities
are
conceivable
all
of
them
occur
for
the
developments
of
technique
have
rendered
available
almost
a
direct
view
of
the
sella
turcica
in
the
first
place
the
bony
box
may
be
definitely
too
small
to
start
in
with
that
means
a
small
and
so
potentially
inadequate
pituitary
both
anterior
and
posterior
potentially
inadequate
in
that
it
will
become
impossible
for
it
to
grow
and
produce
extra
secretion
upon
demand
handicapped
thus
the
unfortunate
so
born
is
doomed
to
inferiority
and
very
little
can
be
done
for
him
he
will
not
develop
satisfactorily
he
possesses
small
genital
organs
which
will
not
evolve
properly
in
adolescence
or
if
they
will
not
stand
still
tend
to
revert
to
the
opposite
sex
type
then
he
tends
to
be
dwarfed
fatigable
adipose
among
these
types
are
included
subjects
of
obsessions
and
compulsions
who
are
dull
and
apathetic
can
not
learn
or
maintain
inhibitions
and
so
without
initiative
evolve
into
moral
and
intellectual
degenerates
liable
to
epilepsy
and
the
most
remarkable
sex
aberrations
all
because
a
cranny
of
the
skull
about
the
size
of
a
thimble
is
not
large
enough
for
their
dominating
gland
if
the
bone
of
the
cavity
of
the
pituitary
is
softer
and
yielding
so
that
some
enlargement
of
the
gland
is
possible
especially
of
the
anterior
there
appear
rapid
growth
with
a
tendency
to
high
blood
pressure
great
mental
activity
associated
with
frequent
and
severe
headaches
often
of
the
migraine
type
a
combination
of
initiative
and
irritability
and
a
marked
sexuality
examination
of
the
sella
turcica
shows
what
is
called
erosion
of
the
bone
as
it
yields
to
the
pressure
of
the
growing
gland
the
ideal
sella
turcica
for
the
ideal
pituitary
type
is
a
large
room
in
which
the
gland
may
grow
and
reach
its
maximum
size
and
so
its
maximum
function
without
needing
to
exert
pressure
or
destroy
and
erode
bone
in
front
of
it
to
the
side
of
it
or
behind
it
the
distinctive
masculine
and
feminine
types
classed
as
the
normal
belong
to
this
group
sometimes
the
bone
in
front
of
the
pituitary
will
yield
while
the
one
in
the
rear
will
not
and
sometimes
the
conditions
are
reversed
thus
we
may
have
sufficiency
with
insufficiency
or
insufficiency
with
sufficiency
complexes
which
contribute
to
create
the
grosser
functional
hermaphrodite
types
of
mixed

that
the

tragedies
can
not

the

determines
that
the

certain
types
of

associated
with

dominant
next
to
be

are
peculiarly
susceptible

emotional

they
are

sometimes

their

have
been
called
psycholepsy
among
the
italians
especially
they
were
watched
and
reported
during
the
war
when
the
explosive
fits
were
seen
to
take
the
form
of
irresponsible
acts
of
insubordination
or
violence
the
personalities
during
the
first
period
of
childhood
up
to
five
six
or
seven
or
more
accurately
up
to
the
point
at
which
the
permanent
teeth
begin
to
appear
every
child
may
be
said
to
be
a
organism
because
the
thymus
holding
the
other
endocrines
in
check
controls
its
life
that
is
why
up
to
the
third
and
fourth
years
at
any
rate
most
children
seem
alike
closer
observation
however
reveals
points
of
differentiation
and
signs
of
the
coming
potencies
of
the
other
hormones
during
the
second
period
up
to
puberty
these
marks
of
the
deeper
underlying
forces
of
the
personality
make
themselves
more
and
more
felt
the
thymus
like
a
brake
that
is
becoming
worn
out
continues
to
function
in
a
progressively
weaker
fashion
until
with
the
arrival
of
the
gonadal
ovaries
or
testes
internal
secretion
its
influence
is
wiped
out
there
is
a
definite
degree
of
thymus
activity
during
childhood
unless
by
its
premature
involution
precocity
displaces
juvenility
yet
even
during
childhood
there
are
certain
individuals
with
excessive
thymus
action
foreshadowing
a
continued
thymus
predominance
throughout
life
the
angel
child
is
the
type
regularly
proportioned
and
perfectly
made
like
a
fine
piece
of
sculpture
with
delicately
chiselled
features
transparent
skin
changing
color
easily
long
silky
hair
with
an
exceptional
grace
of
movement
and
an
alertness
of
mind
they
seem
the
embodiment
of
beauty
but
somehow
unfit
for
the
coarse
conflicts
of
life
in
english
literature
several
characters
are
recognizable
as
portraits
of
the
type
notably
paul
dombey
whose
nurse
recognized
that
he
was
not
for
this
world
they
may
look
the
picture
of
health
but
they
are
more
liable
than
any
other
children
to
be
eliminated
by
tuberculosis
meningitis
or
even
one
of
the
common
diseases
of
childhood
it
is
after
puberty
when
the
thymus
should
shrink
and
pass
out
of
the
endocrine
concert
as
a
power
that
the
more
complex
reactions
of
personality
emerge
when
the
thymus
persists
and
refuses
to
or
can
not
retire
the
persistent
thymus
always
then
throws
its
shadow
over
the
entire
personality
to
what
extent
that
shadow
spreads
depends
upon
the
strength
of
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
their
ability
to
compensate
or
to
stay
inhibited
whether
or
not
the
pituitary
will
be
able
to
enlarge
in
its
bony
cradle
seems
to
be
the
most
important
factor
determining
these
variations
if
there
is
space
for
it
to
grow
at
any
rate
normally
the
individual
may
pass
for
normal
although
he
will
have
difficulties
throughout
life
he
may
never
understand
particularly
in
sexual
directions
if
the
pituitary
is
limited
partially
or
completely
the
thymus
predominance
is
more
prominent
and
fixed
and
the
abnormalities
become
obvious
both
of
person
and
conduct
the
anatomic
architecture
of
the
latter
personality
is
fairly
typical
the
reversion
in
type
of
the
reproductive
organs
the
slender
waist
the
gracefully
formed
body
the
rounded
limbs
the
long
chest
and
the
feminine
pelvis
strike
one
at
the
first
glance
the
texture
of
the
skin
is
smooth
as
a
baby
and
sometimes
velvety
to
the
touch
its
color
may
be
an
opaque
white
or
faintly
creamy
or
there
may
be
an
effect
of
a
filmy
sheen
over
a
florid
complexion
little
or
no
hair
on
the
face
contributes
to
the
general
feminine
aspect
in
the
more
extreme
types
they
are
often
double
jointed
somewhere
flat
footed
in
women
the
external
manifestations
of
a
personality
may
be
limited
to
thinness
and
delicacy
of
the
skin
narrow
waist
rather
poorly
developed
breasts
arched
thighs
and
scanty
hair
with
scanty
and
delayed
menstruation
or
there
may
be
obesity
with
juvenility
if
there
is
a
repression
of
the
pituitary
secretion
for
one
reason
or
other
in
their
reactions
to
the
problems
physical
and
psychic
of
everyday
life
the
are
distinctly
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
first
place
muscular
strain
stress
or
shock
is
dangerous
to
them
because
they
have
a
small
heart
and
remarkably
fragile
blood
vessels
which
renders
their
circulation
incapable
of
responding
to
an
emergency
or
at
least
definitely
handicapped
in
infancy
they
may
die
suddenly
because
of
this
either
for
no
ascertainable
cause
at
all
or
because
of
some
slight
excitement
like
that
attending
some
slight
operation
a
fall
or
a
mild
illness
during
the
epoch
they
are
unable
to
cope
with
the
necessities
of
an
active
child
existence
in
playing
with
other
children
puberty
and
adolescence
are
specially
perilous
to
them
for
they
may
endeavour
to
compensate
for
an
inner
feeling
of
physical
inferiority
by
going
in
strenuously
for
athletics
and
sports
and
so
risking
a
sudden
hemorrhage
in
the
brain
producible
by
the
tearing
of
a
blood
vessel
as
if
constructed
of
defective
rubber
reports
published
in
the
newspapers
from
time
to
time
of
children
or
young
men
instantly
killed
by
a
tap
on
the
jaw
in
a
boxing
contest
or
some
other
trivial
injuries
are
doubtless
samples
of
such
reactions
in
people
as
an
illustration
of
the
conduct
aberrations
of
the
personality
during
adult
life
the
following
extracts
from
a
newspaper
report
of
a
suicide
are
worth
quoting
an
autopsy
made
yesterday
by
benjamin
schwartz
first
assistant
to
charles
norris
chief
medical
examiner
removed
any
mystery
that
surrounded
the
death
on
saturday
night
by
pistol
bullets
of
josé
arenas
and
the
wounding
of
ruth
jackson
and
ignatio
marti
schwartz
said
that
his
examination
had
convinced
him
beyond
doubt
that
the
dead
had
killed
himself
after
he
had
tried
to
take
the
life
of
the
young
woman
with
whom
he
had
lived
and
of
the
youth
who
was
his
successful
rival
that
schwartz
said
report
to
the
police
will
include
a
statement
from
the
young
woman
to
me
that
she
always
had
understood
that
arenas
had
killed
some
one
in
havana
cuba
before
he
came
to
new
york
the
autopsy
left
no
doubt
that
arenas
was
a
case
of
status
lymphaticus
personality
i
made
a
most
complete
report
because
of
the
scientific
value
of
the
autopsy
confirmed
my
first
deductions
after
seeing
the
body
on
saturday
night
in
the
doctor
furnished
room
with
alcove
bedroom
adjoining
you
will
remember
that
as
soon
as
i
had
seen
him
i
revealed
that
he
was
wearing
corsets
cases
of
status
lymphaticus
are
intensely
interesting
in
them
the
blood
vessels
are
very
small
and
the
lymphatic
clement
is
greatly
in
excess
they
die
suddenly
from
ruptures
of
blood
vessels
many
of
them
are
degenerate
most
of
them
are
criminals
all
of
them
are
liable
to
commit
crimes
of
passion
among
them
are
found
a
large
percentage
of
drug
addicts
jackson
in
the
hospital
confirmed
my
scientific
theory
that
the
dead
man
was
not
normal
she
was
perfectly
frank
in
her
statement
she
said
she
had
left
her
husband
elmer
schultz
an
automobile
salesman
in
toledo
several
months
ago
and
had
come
to
new
york
she
said
she
had
lived
with
the
doctor
for
some
time
ten
days
ago
she
left
him
to
live
with
marti
a
healthy
normal
lad
before
she
went
from
the
doctor
room
she
destroyed
those
colored
collars
that
were
found
beside
the
body
she
cut
them
with
scissors
but
that
was
after
so
she
states
the
doctor
had
destroyed
stockings
of
hers
by
cutting
them
told
me
in
the
hospital
today
and
with
every
appearance
of
truth
that
she
had
met
arenas
in
the
subway
at
the
station
on
street
and
broadway
on
friday
night
and
that
she
had
asked
him
when
she
could
come
and
get
her
clothes
he
said
according
to
her
story
to
the
house
tomorrow
afternoon
but
come
with
marti
said
that
she
and
marti
went
there
according
to
this
invitation
that
first
the
doctor
showed
her
the
cut
collars
and
told
her
that
she
would
get
her
clothes
back
in
perfect
condition
and
that
the
next
thing
she
knew
she
had
been
shot
she
could
remember
much
after
that
believe
that
both
she
and
marti
have
told
a
perfectly
straightforward
story
and
the
autopsy
is
proof
of
it
were
six
bullets
in
the
doctor
pistol
to
be
accounted
for
one
in
an
undischarged
cartridge
still
was
in
the
weapon
that
leaves
five
one
struck
miss
jackson
in
the
right
chest
squarely
in
front
and
penetrated
the
flesh
about
one
inch
if
there
had
been
any
power
at
all
behind
the
missile
it
would
have
gone
right
through
pierced
a
lung
caused
a
hemorrhage
and
the
chances
are
that
miss
jackson
would
have
died
that
leaves
four
bullets
more
struck
marti
in
the
left
upper
chest
it
passed
through
the
pocket
there
and
the
skirt
grazed
the
skin
and
then
bounced
over
to
the
right
hand
side
in
front
it
was
a
most
amazing
case
of
a
bounding
bullet
i
was
particularly
careful
about
examining
its
course
because
at
first
i
was
suspicious
of
the
stories
that
were
told
by
marti
and
miss
jackson
now
i
know
they
are
true
anyone
might
have
been
puzzled
by
the
queer
antics
of
the
missiles
from
the
pistol
of
south
american
manufacture
that
the
doctor
used
if
it
had
had
any
penetrating
power
or
rather
if
the
bullets
that
it
sent
out
had
any
real
kick
behind
them
the
chances
are
that
both
miss
jackson
and
marti
would
be
dead
now
bullets
it
will
be
remembered
entered
the
doctor
left
chest
quite
close
together
well
one
nicked
the
heart
and
lodged
between
the
lung
and
the
heart
it
did
cause
any
more
damage
than
a
mosquito
bite
second
bullet
went
through
the
soft
flesh
of
the
chest
but
it
struck
a
rib
and
bounded
back
out
again
that
bullet
was
picked
up
beside
the
body
these
vain
attempts
to
send
a
bullet
through
his
body
to
a
fatal
spot
the
doctor
apparently
shifted
the
weapon
to
his
right
temple
and
pulled
the
trigger
for
the
fifth
time
then
the
fifth
bullet
driven
likewise
by
a
very
weak
charge
of
powder
pierced
the
skull
at
a
point
where
it
was
thin
and
tore
into
his
brain
its
lack
of
power
however
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
i
found
it
this
morning
in
the
brain
tissue
all
my
experience
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
queer
it
sounds
almost
like
a
dream
a
man
trying
to
kill
with
a
pistol
that
shoots
bullets
that
either
stop
after
striking
soft
flesh
or
bound
out
of
the
body
into
which
they
are
fired
but
it
is
true
i
have
had
all
of
the
bullets
in
my
hand
are
all
accounted
for
they
are
all
of
the
same
sort
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
they
are
all
from
the
same
weapon
an
instrument
without
manufacturer
name
and
of
a
design
that
the
police
say
is
unfamiliar
to
them
dead
doctor
was
a
distinct
type
and
his
tragic
end
was
one
that
should
not
surprise
anyone
who
has
any
knowledge
of
such
cases
the
courtroom
was
thronged
with
friends
of
the
dead
who
not
only
is
reported
to
be
of
a
wealthy
family
of
bogota
colombia
but
generally
is
credited
with
many
charitable
works
in
the
uptown
spanish
colony
here
the
distinct
type
to
which
the
first
assistant
to
the
chief
medical
examiner
of
the
city
referred
is
the
personality
status
lymphaticus
is
another
technical
name
for
it
we
have
been
considering
the
persistence
of
the
thymus
after
adolescence
makes
for
an
arrest
of
masculinization
or
feminization
the
arrived
at
by
the
processes
of
puberty
that
is
a
partial
castration
takes
place
now
as
the
experiments
of
steinach
upon
the
transplantation
of
ovaries
into
males
deprived
of
their
testes
and
of
testes
into
females
deprived
of
their
ovaries
have
demonstrated
the
removal
of
the
interstitial
cells
of
one
sex
assists
enormously
in
arousing
the
opposite
sex
traits
that
have
been
latent
homosexuality
in
a
tendencies
to
homosexuality
and
masochism
appear
and
so
all
the
remarkable
of
those
processes
that
the
freudians
have
so
lovingly
traced
the
father
complex
in
men
the
inferiority
complex
and
the
feminoid
complex
in
general
the
feminoid
complex
introduces
again
the
character
of
the
functional
hermaphrodite
the
mixed
the
sex
index
will
certainly
come
in
time
as
a
measurement
of
sexuality
but
until
then
some
more
available
classification
of
sex
tendency
is
necessary
including
sex
intergrades
one
may
divide
sex
types
into
six
classes
male
female
and
the
sex
intergrades
the
four
hyphenated
classes
nearly
all
have
some
degree
of
persistent
thymus
if
its
influence
is
partial
the
emphasis
is
before
the
hyphen
upon
the
ostensible
if
its
influence
is
unchecked
the
emphasis
is
after
the
hyphen
upon
the
apparently
latent
sex
the
sex
difficulties
produced
in
these
people
by
the
conflict
between
their
conscious
sex
and
their
subconscious
sex
the
sex
duel
in
the
same
mind
siamese
twins
pulling
in
diametrically
opposite
directions
are
comprehensible
only
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
internal
secretions
homosexuality
in
one
form
or
another
frank
or
concealed
haunts
the
and
spoils
his
life
the
persistent
thymus
like
a
vindictive
electra
stalks
the
footsteps
of
its
victim
its
possessor
he
wishes
to
live
according
to
society
remorselessly
rigid
expectations
for
virility
and
happiness
but
his
thymus
condition
forces
him
also
to
live
for
femininity
and
misery
that
homosexuality
is
not
purely
a
psychic
matter
of
complexes
and
introversion
as
the
newest
psychology
would
have
us
believe
has
been
proved
by
observations
of
its
development
in
animals
with
internal
secretion
disturbances
acquired
or
experimental
thus
it
has
been
recorded
that
a
male
dog

persistence
is
common
what
complicates
his
sex
difficulties
and
makes
social
adjustment
almost
impossible
or
completely
impossible
is
that
his
pituitary
frequently
can
not
react
to
assist
him
often
as
emphasized
it
is
bound
in
by
bone
on
all
sides
and
neither

for
his

so
social
instinct
and
the
capacity
for
inhibition
the
ability
to
control
himself
conceptually
and
somatically
are
poor
as
a
child
it
is
difficult
to
train
him
along
the
lines
of
the
elementary

and
customs
he
is
into

a

his
mother
realizes
soon
that
he
can
not
be
made
to
acquire
a
sense
of
responsibility
either
for
himself
or
for
others
she
becomes
afraid
to
let
him
go
into
the

because
of
his
inability
to
take
care
of
himself
to
acquire
the
right
attitude
toward
street
cars
autos
strangers
in
short
danger
she
dreads
to
take
him
to
places
because
no
sooner
would
they
be
out
of
them
than
she
would
discover
that
he
had
taken
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
quite
as
a
matter
of

he
will
fabricate

with

fabricate
them
out
of

for
the
pure

of
it

moral

the

of

of

from

up
with
so
much
against

physical

mental

it

that
the

they
are
the
hopeless
misfits
of

if
the

they

may
still

a

become
adapted
to

in

because
the

and
becomes

in

they

an
increase
in

with
a

the

historically
the
thymocentrics
who
combined
brilliancy
and

played
a
great
part
as
some
of
the
famous
adventurers
and
restless
experimentalists
the
sex
gland
centered
or
personalities
the
eunuchoid
personality
among
the
individuals
whose
personality
is
dominated
by
their
sex
glands
the
physiognomy
physique
and
life
reactions
are
so
distinctive
that
no
better
examples
exist
of
our
main
thesis
that
the
whole
life
of
man
is
controlled
primarily
by
his
internal
secretions
these
types
are
not
all
necessarily
sex
gland
deficient
as
the
term
eunuchoid
implies
they
may
be
rather
gonad
unstable
with
a
corresponding
instability
of
the
entire
endocrine
system
about
the
face
of
the
eunuchoid
the
striking
feature
is
the
incomplete
irregular
or
absent
hair
development
below
thirty
it
is
chubby
and
ruddy
and
rather
childish
in
its
texture
after
thirty
there
is
an
effect
of
premature
senility
the
skin
is
yellowish
leathery
and
wrinkled
as
the
faces
of
old
women
are
wrinkled
the
upper
lip
is
traversed
by
vertical
wrinkles
and
wrinkles
come
around
corners
of
the
mouth
the
expression
is
juvenile
effeminate
or
plaintive
invariably
the
voice
is
higher
pitched
than
the
usual
masculine
tones
it
may
be
gentle
and
subdued
like
a
genteel
female
or
strident
and
rasping
occasionally
it
is
a
pleasant
high
tenor
the
adam
apple
poetic
popular
name
for
the
thyroid
cartilage
is
never
prominent
because
it
is
not
ossified
as
it
should
be
in
the
normal
male
tall
and
slender
or
generally
undersized
the
muscles
are
soft
and
flabby
as
a
woman
the
hands
and
feet
are
small
and
gracile
typically
viewed
in
profile
the
lines
of
the
body
are
feminine
the
breasts
may
reach
almost
the
size
of
the
female
and
there
may
be
a
area
of
pigmentation
around
the
nipple
the
hair
growth
under
the
shoulders
and
on
the
lower
abdomen
tends
to
be
scanty
and
to
approximate
the
opposite
sex
in
quality
and
distribution
as
do
the
reproductive
organs
themselves
these
traits
of
physiognomy
and
physique
indicate
functional
hermaphroditism
in
the
underlying
feminoid
constitution
the
feminoid
constitution
appears
again
in
the
supposedly
masculine
the
feminoid
constitution
should
not
be
confused
with
the
infantiloid
constitution
the
former
the
personality
is
a
digression
of
growth
a
deviated
evolution
of
the
individual
because
of
the
conflicting
forces
some
masculine
and
some
feminine
in
his
the
infantiloid
constitution
is
one
of
arrested
development
and
may
center
around
the
arrested
function
in
childhood
or
adolescence
of
any
one
or
a
number
of
endocrine
glands
yet
the
two
may
resemble
one
another
pretty
closely
at
times
a
cretin
imitates
the
extreme
grade
of
infantiloid
constitution
the
infantiloid
is
a
sort
of
enlarged
and
lengthened
child
the
feminoid
is
ostensibly
a
man
with
a
good
deal
of
woman
in
him
the
infantiloid
is
a
quite
general
type
but
of
course
when
typical
is
a
freak
recognized
and
treated
as
such
how
far
the
eunuchoid
may
deviate
from
the
normal
is
suggested
by
the
following
description
of
one
face
rounded
chubby
devoid
of
hair
eyes
puffed
lips
protruding
and
fleshy
cheeks
round
and
thick
nose
little
developed
skin
thick
and
of
clear
color
disproportion
between
the
size
of
head
and
body
hair
of
scalp
fine
brows
and
lashes
scarce
trunk
elongated
and
cylindrical
limbs
thick
and
plump
tapering
from
the
root
to
the
extremities
good
fat
layers
over
the
entire
body
reproductive
organs
those
of
a
little
boy
infantile
mental
state
naïvete
timidity
easily
evoked
tears
and
laughter
promptly
aroused
but
fugitive
wrath
excessive
tenderness
but
unreasonable
dislikes
an
almost
wholly
mental
infantiloid
state
or
one
purely
physical
may
occur
certain
rather
large
tom
thumbs
belong
to
the
group
in
everyday
life
we
see
doll
creatures
overgrown
children
on
every
hand
mental
measurements
of
any
large
group
of
population
reveal
a
remarkable
percentage
of
it
as
below
the
mental
age
of
juvenile
traits
and
juvenile
mind
separate
or
combined
should
always
suggest
the
possibility
of
the
infantiloid
constitution
of
one
type
of
thymocentric
also
the
eunuchoid
or
feminoid
personality
is
also
found
often
among
artists
one
must
carefully
distinguish
the
two
because
the
ensemble
of
characteristics
of
the
one
may
easily
stimulate
the
other
yet
fundamentally
they
are
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
the
infantiloid
type
never
rises
above
the
subnormal
which
is
its
habitat
while
the
feminoid
type
or
masculinoid
in
woman
often
produces
an
abnormal
personality
which
rises
above
the
normal
the
infantiloids
become
the
slaves
and
the
weaklings
of
society
the
mark
tapleys
and
the
tom
pinches
while
the
eunuchoids
have
created
splendid
literature
and
immortal
music
the
life
reactions
and
especially
the
sex
reactions
of
the
are
as
complex
and
difficult
as
those
of
the
straightforward
homosexuality
and
the
eunuchoid
constitution
have
always
been
intimate
the
homosexuality
of
the
is
more
subtle
and
disguised
often
buried
under
the
stronger
masculine
component
of
the
personality
homosexuality
as
a
cult
has
appeared
correlated
with
the
production
of
the
functional
hermaphrodite
by
artificially
creating
the
eunuchoid
type
of
constitution
among
the
aztecs
homosexuals
were
produced
in
quantity
for
religious
purposes
by
a
deliberate
fostering
of
the
eunuchoid
constitution
they
called
them
the
mujerados
their
method
consisted
in
making
a
healthy
man
ride
horseback
constantly
until
an
irritable
weakness
of
the
reproductive
organs
ensued
and
a
paralytic
impotence
followed
the
exhausted
testes
would
then
atrophy
and
the
voice
ring
falsetto
muscular
tone
and
energy
diminish
inclinations
and
habits
become
feminine
the
mujerado
lost
his
position
in
society
as
a
man
assumed
female
clothing
manners
and
customs
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
was
treated
as
a
woman
their
large
breasts
were
said
to
be
capable
of
lactation
their
only
reward
was
the
high
honor
paid
them
as
religious
consecrates
among
the
phoenicians
there
was
a
similar
sect
devoted
to
the
worship
of
astarte
known
as
the
galli
they
were
men
who
had
transformed
themselves
into
the
closest
possible
resemblance
to
women
at
all
times
they
were
prepared
to
engage
with
members
of
either
sex
in
sexual
relations
of
the
most
depraved
kind
they
lived
in
idleness
as
prostitutes
cultivating
and
extending
their
skill
in
sex
perversions
as
specialists
their
initiation
into
their
professional
careers
was
a
part
of
a
religious
ritual
during
the
revels
of
great
festivals
apprentices
to
the
trade
wrought
up
by
certain
traditional
songs
and
music
would
be
hypnotised
into
a
frenzy
run
amuck
throw
off
every
garment
and
snatching
up
swords
deliberately
placed
in
convenient
spots
castrate
themselves
at
one
blow
in
a
wilder
hysteria
screaming
loudly
the
eunuchs
would
then
run
through
the
streets
holding
the
severed
organs
high
above
their
heads
at
last
faint
through
loss
of
blood
they
brought
their
madness
to
its
climax
by
hurling
the
organs
in
their
hands
into
the
nearest
houses
so
forcing
the
owners
to
take
them
in
and
provide
them
with
female
wearing
apparel
and
the
other
feminine
accoutrements
of
war
henceforth
this
manner
of
dress
was
not
to
be
changed
the
physical
changes
followed
the
hair
of
the
face
was
lost
the
breasts
enlarged
the
voice
became
and
the
other
of
the
eunuchoid
complex
appeared
these
constitutions
thus
may
be
either
congenital
or
acquired
individuals
apparently
normal
during
childhood
and
adolescence
may
be
transformed
injuries
to
the
reproductive
glands
sometimes
the
slightest
bruises
may
lead
to
atrophy
and
a
change
of
personality
follows
in
less
than
six
weeks
mumps
may
achieve
the
same
results
because
of
the
inflammation
of
the
gonads
that
may
accompany
or
follow
it
whole
family
and
races
may
show
some
of
the
signs
of
the
eunuchoid
constitution
for
generations
according
to
darwin
descent
of
man
the
development
of
the
beard
and
the
hairiness
of
the
body
differ
remarkably
in
the
men
of
distinct
races
and
even
in
different
tribes
and
families
of
the
same
race
on
the
continent
beards
prevail
until
we
pass
beyond
india
although
with
the
natives
of
ceylon
they
are
often
absent
eastward
of
india
beards
disappear
as
with
the
siamese
kalmuks
malays
chinese
and
japanese
throughout
the
great
american
continent
the
men
may
be
said
to
be
beardless
but
in
almost
all
tribes
a
few
short
hairs
are
apt
to
appear
on
the
face
especially
in
old
age
hair
being
an
adrenal
cortex
trait
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
hairless
families
and
races
are
more
eunuchoid
and
possess
less
of
the
adrenal
cortex
secretion
than
the
more
hairy
whatever
the
exceptions
and
there
have
been
eunuch
generals
in
history
marces
chancellor
of
justinian
who
beat
the
goths
at
nocera
and
ali
the
gallant
who
commanded
the
turkish
army
after
the
invasion
of
hungary
in
the
eunuchoid
generally
runs
to
type
in
his
mentality
and
his
sexuality
he
is
an
introvert
his
personality
is
shut
in
he
isolates
himself
from
the
world
the
lower
eunuchoids
exhibit
a
curiously
personality
naïvely
confiding
communicating
to
all
comers
all
their
joys
and
sorrows
they
ask
diffidently
for
confirmation
of
their
statements
and
they
pass
quickly
from
tears
to
laughter
about
sexual
matters
they
are
extremely
timid
a
moral
innocence
pervades
their
speech
and
conduct
usually
they
have
no
true
conception
of
crimes
of
jealousy
or
passion
the
occupations
they
go
in
for
are
those
without
responsibility
away
from
crowds
or
observation
such
as
ship
cooks
stewards
and
so
on
they
marry
to
find
a
home
without
the
object
of
establishing
sexual
relations
when
they
are
asked
whether
they
think
their
wives
will
be
pleased
to
look
at
the
matter
in
the
same
light
and
be
contented
to
live
with
a
man
upon
such
conditions
they
are
puzzled
or
perplexed
as
if
they
had
never
thought
seriously
about
the
matter
before
their
simplicity
has
even
extended
to
proposing
to
their
wives
to
seek
gratification
from
some
other
man
naturally
such
an
arrangement
often
proves
unsatisfactory
and
desertion
follows
concerning
the
children
sometimes
the
offspring
of
these
unions
scepticism
as
to
the
identity
of
the
father
is
decidedly
permissible
still
in
some
cases
the
best
of
evidence
exists
that
fertility
occurs
the
vitality
of
the
children
then
is
subnormal
and
the
mortality
rate
high
the
eunuchoid
tendency
is
transmitted
variations
and
transitions
of
every
kind
are
found
among
the
undersexed
eunuchoid
personalities
depending
upon
the
quality
and
degree
of
the
secretions
lacking
when
there
is
an
excess
of
these
sex
secretions
a
turbulent
tempestuous
sexually
sensitive
temperament
that
may
go
on
to
satyriasis
or
nymphomania
is
created
it
has
been
shown
that
doves
can
be
rendered
overfeminine
in
their
behaviour
and
characteristics
by
injections
of
ovarian
material
oversexed
types
of
personality
therefore
may
exist
as
well
as
undersexed
combinations
and
permutations
the
types
of
personality
sketched
the
thyrocentric
the
pituitocentric
the
adrenocentric
the
thymocentric
the
gonadocentric
are
really
prototypes
the
great
kingdoms
of
personality
to
which
individuals
can
be
assigned
by
hall
marks
which
facilitate
their
classification
they
may
also
be
described
as
the
pure
endocrine
types
which
include
a
minority
of
a
population
but
the
majority
consist
of
dominant
mixtures
hyphenates
groups
which
are
the
species
and
varieties
of
the
greater
classes
combinations
and
variations
of
control
among
the
adrenals
and
thyroid
pituitary
or
thymus
and
so
on
occur
with
effects
that
are
sometimes
additive
reinforcing
a
particular
trait
of
the
person
and
at
others
conflicting
and
neutralizing
quantitative
variations
of
the
same
secretion
may
occur
periodically
in
the
same
individual
which
explains
the
multiplicity
and
complexity
the
inconsistency
and
contradictions
of
conduct
in
a
man
or
woman
at
the
different
episodes
and
crises
of
life
to
a
certain
extent
there
should
be
a
stable
balance
between
the
various
endocrines
the
stability
expressing
itself
in
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
the
normal
there
should
also
be
a
balance
between
the
antagonistic
elements
in
the
same
gland
for
instance
the
pituitary
the
pituitary
built
of
two
distinct
portions
the
anterior
and
the
posterior
is
in
equilibrium
when
the
two
are
nicely
adjusted
but
the
accidents
and
vicissitudes
of
life
pregnancy
for
example
will
upset
the
balance
and
so
there
will
result
changes
of
physique
conduct
and
character
like
possibilities
apply
to
all
the
other
glands
of
internal
secretion
in
our
ability
to
exercise
a
control
over
these
disturbances
of
balance
to
be
developed
in
the
future
lies
one
of
the
great
hopes
for
a
chemical
perfectability
of
human
life
and
nature
nature
experiments
the
kinds
of
personality
described
as
prototypes
and
variants
and
the
fundamental
facts
supporting
the
view
that
they
are
the
reaction
types
of
the
human
beings
we
meet
in
everyday
life
represent
simply
a
beginning
of
the
work
to
be
done
putting
into
our
hands
a
new
powerful
searchlight
that
penetrates
the
interiors
of
body
and
soul
a
fresh
attitude
toward
the
complicated
problems
of
man
in
society
grows
imminent
the
normal
and
the
abnormal
become
illuminated
with
an
effect
as
if
our
retinas
were
suddenly
to
get
sensitive
to
the

biography

as
the

of

become
capable
of

from

if
human
life
in
its
essentials
is
so
much
the
product
of
the
internal

system
we
speak
of
as
the
endocrines
then
biography
should
present
us
with
a
number
of
illustrations
of
their
power
and
influence
what
is
the
evidence
that
as
huxley
anticipated
the
introduction
into
the
economy
of
a
molecular
mechanism
which
like
a
cunningly
contrived
torpedo
shall
find
its
way
to
some
particular
group
of
living
elements
and
cause
an
explosion
among
them
leaving
the
rest
untouched
and
the
multiplication
of
such
cunningly
contrived
mechanisms
were
responsible
for
those
personalities
magnificent
chemical
compounds
with
whose
adventures
historians
are
concerned
the
case
of
napoleon
as
a
unique
will
and
intelligence
napoleon
bonaparte
the
first
must
be
classed
as
one
of
the
betelegeuses
of
the
race
wells
has
called
his
career
the
raid
of
an
intolerable
egotist
across
the
disordered
beginning
of
a
new
time
the
figure
of
an
adventurer
and
wrecker
this
saturnine
egotist
are
men
dazzled
simply
by
the
scale
of
his
flounderings
by
the
mere
vastness
of
his
notoriety
this
dark
little
archaic
personage
hard
compact
capable
unscrupulous
imitative
and
neatly
vulgar
there
are
other
opinions
the
man
of
destiny
was
worshipped
by
millions
napoleona
bring
fortunes
today
interest
in
the
man
as
a
man
has
multiplied
with
every
year
and
certainly
no
one
can
deny
him
the
quality
of
individuality
in
its
most
exaggerated
form
in
the
second
place
he
belongs
among
the
moderns
modern
science
and
methods
of
observation
have
had
their
chance
at
him
and
have
left
a
conscious
record
of
their
results
napoleon
was
the
central
figure
of
his
time
and
was
watched
by
trained
medical
eyes
during
his
life
and
after
his
death
protocols
of
the
examination
of
his
body
are
accessible
and
napoleonic
specimens
preserved
by
fixing
agents
may
still
be
viewed
at
the
museum
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
england
leonard
guthrie
has
worked
up
the
material
at
hand
in
a
report
which
he
presented
to
the
historical
section
of
the
international
congress
of
medicine
in
london
in
i
propose
to
relate
his
findings
to
some
other
facts
and
the
general
principles
roughly
sketched
in
this
book
there
are
a
number
of
word
portraits
of
napoleon
extant
but
for
our
purposes
certain
of
the
notable
features
of
his
face
and
physique
are
to
be
considered
the
first
characteristic
that
struck
everyone
about
him
was
the
matter
of
his
height
he
was
definitely
at
death
being
about
five
feet
six
inches
in
height
as
has
been
emphasized
several
times
deficiency
or
excess
of
growth
will
always
direct
attention
to
the
pituitary
his
sharply
outlined
features
and
a
powerful
lower
jaw
combined
with
oddly
small
plump
hands
long
straight
black
hair
and
dark
complexion
all
point
to
the
pituitary
with
a
secondary
adrenal
effect
his
pulse
was
slow
according
to
corvisart
his
personal
physician
rarely
above
to
the
minute
his
sexual
life
his
libido
was
abnormal
curiously
explosive
in
their
appearance
and
manifestations
were
his
sexual
impulses
they
beset
him
on
occasions
which
were
sometimes
inconvenient
and
a
peculiarity
about
them
was
that
they
subsided
with
equal
suddenness
if
not
immediately
gratified
or
if
meanwhile
something
occurred
to
discourage
his
attention
all
women
were
to
him
de
joie
sexual
rather
than
social
attractions
in
women
appealed
to
him
he
was
never
in
love
never
possessed
of
permanent
affection
or
tenderness
for
any
woman
this
explosive
periodicity
of
the
sexual
life
with
a
tendency
to
compression
of
it
to
the
merely
physical
is
another
mark
of
some
personalities
two
other
phenomena
that
persisted
throughout
his
life
throw
light
upon
his
endocrine
constitution
one
was
trouble
with
his
bladder
which
he
told
antommarchi
another
physician
bothered
him
as
long
as
he
could
remember
irritability
of
the
bladder
was
so
pronounced
that
he
could
not
sleep
for
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
time
after
battles
the
trouble
became
worse
so
that
it
interfered
with
his
riding
constitutional
difficulties
in
urination
have
been
connected
definitely
with
the
function
of
the
pituitary
the
other
pituitary
disturbances
which
tinctured
his
life
were
certain
brain
storms
attacks
of
vomiting
followed
by
stupor
verging
on
unconsciousness
brought
on
by
outbursts
of
temper
physical
overexertion
mental
strain
or
sexual
excitement
it
has
been
shown
that
such
epileptic
tendencies
are
present
in
subjects
of
pituitary
disease
particularly
those
with
pituitary
instability
in
napoleon
case
the
brain
attacks
may
have
been
crises
of
pituitary
insufficiency
in
a
type
this
supposition
is
borne
out
by
the
headache
which
followed
them
the
headache
of
an
oversecreting
pituitary
compensating
for
a
defect
in
its
formation
during
his
prime
his
intellect
was
mathematical
logical
and
rational
and
remarkable
for
a
prodigious
memory
such
an
intellect
is
the
product
of
an
extraordinary
that
he
never
permitted
feeling
to
interfere
with
the
dictates
of
his
judgment
a
quality
which
rendered
him
the
most
unscrupulous
careerist
of
history
must
be
put
down
to
an
insufficiency
of
the
what
does
to
the
brain
cells
and
the
organism
as
a
whole
to
render
them
susceptible
to
sympathy
and
suggestion
the
social
sublimations
of
the
maternal
instinct
with
its
offsprings
of
religion
and
art
we
have
seen
napoleon
lacked
a
chemical
trace
of
the
religious
instinct
his
sympathy
was
nil
and
his
conquests
were
made
possible
only
because
he
was
blind
to
the
suffering
and
misery
his
greed
for
glory
and
dominion
generated
insufficients
of
this
type
patent
or
concealed
gradually
become
corpulent
as
they
grow
older
the
increasing
corpulency
of
napoleon
was
commented
upon
by
all
observers
a
student
of
his
and
acquainted
with
present
developments
concerning
the
internal
secretions
given
an
opportunity
to
observe
him
as
we
have
when
he
was
alive
and
at
the
height
of
his
success
would
have
had
every
reason
for
classing
him
a
superior
inferior
with
an
instability
of
both
that
would
lead
to
his
final
degeneration
besides
his
insatiable
energy
indicated
an
excellent
thyroid
his
pugnacity
animality
and
genius
for
practical
affairs
a
superb
adrenal
given
the
kind
of
pituitary
he
possessed
with
its
great
intellectual
potential
energy
and
the
relation
between
the
two
parts
which
would
further
the
objects
of
an
intellectual
machine
plus
a
remarkable
thyroid
and
adrenal
plus
the
military
education
napoleon
had
and
the
character
of
the
revolution
into
which
he
was
plunged
and
we
have
the
conditions
out
of
which
his
career
emerged
as
inevitable
that
it
was
his
pituitary
which
first
failed
him
rather
than
the
thyroid
or
adrenal
which
might
have
is
demonstrated
by
a
number
of
considerations
before
he
made
himself
emperor
it
was
noticed
that
he
was
becoming
fat
a
pituitary
symptom
a
comparison
of
portraits
at
different
stages
of
his
rise
and
fall
shows
an
increasing
abdominal
paunch
and
a
laying
down
of
fat
in
the
pituitary
areas
around
the
hips
the
legs
and
so
on
the
beginning
of
weakness
in
judgment
that
he
was
to
exhibit
soon
in
the
invasion
of
russia
manifested
itself
at
the
same
time
his
keen
calculating
ability
attained
the
peak
of
its
curve
at
austerlitz
jena
and
friedland
thereafter
the
descent
begins
a
rash
grandiose
speculative
quality
enters
his
projects
and
divorces
the
elaborate
coordination
of
means
and
end
from
his
plans
that
his
thyroid
energy
capacity
did
not
fail
him
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
at
albans
he
would
ride
for
three
hours
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
tire
himself
sufficiently
for
sleep
that
his
adrenals
were
not
affected
is
indicated
by
the
brutality
which
remained
characteristic
to
the
end
of
his
life
the
findings
after
death
confirm
the
view
of
him
as
an
unstable
pituitocentric
who
succumbed
to
pituitary
insufficiency
toward
the
latter
half
of
his
life
we
possess
the
account
of
the
postmortem
by
henry
who
performed
it
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
was
deeply
covered
with
fat
over
the
sternum
where
generally
the
bone
is
very
superficial
the
fat
was
upwards
of
an
inch
deep
and
an
inch
and
a
half
or
two
inches
on
the
abdomen
there
was
scarcely
any
hair
on
the
body
and
that
of
the
head
was
thin
fine
and
silky
the
whole
genital
system
very
small
seemed
to
exhibit
a
physical
cause
for
the
absence
of
sexual
desire
and
the
chastity
which
had
been
stated
to
have
characterized
the
deceased
during
his
stay
at
helena
the
skin
was
noticed
to
be
very
white
and
delicate
as
were
the
hands
and
arms
indeed
the
whole
body
was
slender
and
effeminate
the
pubis
much
resembled
the
mons
veneris
in
women
the
muscles
of
the
chest
were
small
the
shoulders
were
narrow
and
the
hips
wide
in
other
words
the
typical
feminization
of
the
body
which
accompanies
pituitary
insufficiency
was
found
he
died
of
a
cancer
of
the
stomach
but
before
his
death
there
were
noted
the
mental
transformations
that
succeed
deficiency
of
his
central
endocrine
apathy
indolence
fatigability
and
frilosity
were
what
impressed
his
associates
at
helena
the
deterioration
of
his
mentality
was
also
exemplified
in
his
literary
diversions
the
siege
of
troy
and
the
essay
on
suicide
the
puerility
of
these
productions
as
well
as
of
his
conduct
a
sulking
before
his
captors
and
the
decline
of
his
physical
energy
once
a
bottomless
well
all
point
to
the
same
conclusion
the
rise
and
fall
of
napoleon
followed
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
pituitary
gland
no
better
illustration
exists
of
the
fundamental
determination
of
a
personality
and
its
career
by
an
endocrine
aside
from
other
factors
of
education
environment
accident
and
opportunity
without
the
sort
of
endocrine
equipment
he
was
born
with
however
none
of
the
other
factors
would
have
found
the
material
to
work
upon
born
say
with
more
of
a
posterior
pituitary
than
he
had
which
would
have
rendered
him
more
sensitive
to
the
sufferings
of
his
if
nothing
else
and
the
forces
of
the
revolution
probably
would
have
swamped
him
from
the
very
first
moment
of
his
emergence
at
toulon
when
the
whiff
of
symptom
of
an
inexorable
merciless
intellect
and
will
started
him
upon
the
road
that
led
to
the
napoleonic
era
destiny
is
always
ironic
for
the
deficiency
of
the
internal
secretions
which
made
him
eligible
for
glory
was
responsible
as
well
as
for
his
downfall
epilepsy
and
migraine
in
genius
in
the
annals
of
genius
there
occur
a
number
of
instances
of
those
who
suffered
from
attacks
that
have
been
diagnosed
epilepsy
or
migraine
because
their
ailment
was
associated
with
their
extraordinary
ability
they
attracted
an
attention
that
concerned
itself
not
at
all
with
the
circumstance
that
genius
has
also
been
liable
to
measles
scarlet
fever
and
so
on
epilepsy
and
migraine
certainly
occur
in
people
of
no
supernormal
gifts
and
often
in
degenerates
and
subnormals
yet
the
fact
remains
that
these
affections
of
the
nervous
system
so
terrible
to
feel
and
to
behold
have
afflicted
the
finest
brains
of
the
race
about
forty
years
ago
the
idea
established
itself
that
epilepsy
exhibiting
itself
in
one
form
or
another
as
fits
and
migraine
the
severe
periodic
sick
headache
were
interconvertible
manifestations
of
the
same
underlying
morbid
process
in
the
brain
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
concrete
cause
attackable
on
the
material
side
was
elicited
by
this
generalization
then
the
investigations
of
the
pituitary
in
the
last
decade
produced
evidence
of
and
symptoms
in
sufferers
from
tumors
or
other
enlargements
of
it
reasoning
back
cases
of
epilepsy
and
migraine
began
to
be
examined
for
evidences
of
involvement
of
the
pituitary
in
their
troubles
these
accumulated
rapidly
the
physiognomy
and
physique
of
the
were
discovered
in
them
the
phenomena
noted
in
napoleon
case
were
often
present
lowering
of
the
pulse
chilliness
and
an
increased
irritability
of
the
bladder
in
women
the
attack
often
coincides
with
the
menstrual
period
a
typical
time
of
endocrine
unbalance
finally
examinations
of
the
sella
turcica
the
bony
lodging
of
the
pituitary
clinched
the
matter
it
often
appeared
small
or
enlarged
with
erosions
of
the
bone
signifying
a
desperate
attempt
of
the
gland
to
grow
and
meet
the
needs
of
the
organism
the
complex
of
appearances
called
migraine
now
becomes
understandable
there
are
a
number
of
factors
such
as
fatigue
intense
cold
or
high
sugar
food
like
chocolate
which
will
cause
an
engorgement
of
the
gland
with
blood
and
swelling
of
it
but
they
do
not
concern
us
now
intense
mental
occupation
concentration
as
the
popular
term
has
it
acts
as
a
patent
excitor
of
the
attack
brain
work
drives
more
blood
into
the
brain
and
the
gland
besides
mental
activity
is
accompanied
by
increased
function
of
the
if
intellectual
or
of
the
if
emotional
brain
work
then
causes
a
temporary
enlargement
of
the
gland
if
now
the
bone
container
of
the
endocrine
is
too
small
to
permit
of
much
swelling
the
bone
will
be
pressed
against
or
even
worn
into
this
means
headache
severe
easily
going
on
to
the
kind
known
as
the
nerves
which
move
the
eyes
in
various
directions
lie
next
to
the
pituitary
if
in
its
expansion
it
moves
sufficiently
outward
it
may
press
upon
irritate
them
or
paralyze
and
so
evolve
various
eye
disturbances
in
association
with
the
headache
no
one
can
overrate
this
conception
of
migraine
for
a
number
of
men
of
genius
have
suffered
from
and
eye
symptoms
as
for
epilepsy
the
problem
is
more
complex
one
has
to
rule
out
first
those
who
have
organic
destructive
disease
of
the
brain
but
they
are
out
of
our
field
genius
predicates
at
least
an
intact
brain
of
the
others
a
number
may
be
interpreted
upon
an
endocrine
basis
at
least
they
will
in
their
physiognomy
physique
mentality
conduct
and
character
document
the
glandular
constellation
under
which
they
live
and
a
proper
understanding
of
which
is
necessary
for
them
to
be
helped
one
frequently
seen
is
the
with
small
enclosed
sella
turcica
the
latter
fact
explains
the
occurrence
of
the
epilepsy
periodic
variations
in
the
secretory
tides
of
the
other
endocrines
the
ovaries
the
thyroid
and
so
on
may
determine
the
onset
of
the
attack
of
fits
the
point
is
that
when
epilepsy
plays
a
constant
part
in
the
life
history
of
a
man
of
genius
we
are
justified
in
assuming
a
disturbed
balance
among
his
hormones
and
so
a
reasoned
picture
perhaps
of
the
foundations
for
the
erratic
in
his
behaviour
or
his
productions
the
neurasthenic
genius
the
fin
de
siècle
intelligentsia
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
quite
stirred
up
by
a
publication
of
max
nordau
on
degeneration
in
which
a
number
of
revered
artists
and
intelligents
were
held
up
to
public
scorn
as
degenerates
and
neurasthenics
so
wrought
up
were
they
in
fact
that
bernard
shaw
was
moved
to
compose
a
defense
entitled
the
sanity
of
art
in
spite
of
the
great
vegetarian
dialectics
it
remains
to
be
explained
why
a
certain
species
of
creative
ability
has
been
combined
with
the
fatigability
variability
and
general
wretched
irritability
of
every
organ
and
tissue
in
the
body
which
taught
them
that
they
were
sensitive
souls
imprisoned
in
the
flesh
going
from
doctor

doctor
as
from

to

from
this
medical
creed
to
that
hygienic
cult
lucky
to
escape
the
worst
often
landing
upon
the
bosom
of
new
thought
for
succor
we
have
noted
in
previous
chapters
the
relation
of
neurasthenia
to
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
in
general
and
to
adrenal
insufficiency
in
particular
a
closer
examination
of
neurasthenic
genius
will
show
it
to
consist
essentially
of
a
pituitocentric
in
whom
for
one
reason
or
another
congenital

of

of

friedrich
nietzsche
is
about
as
good
a
case
as
there
is
on
record
of
a
genius
blasted
by
migraine
the
originality
and
force
of
his
mind
as
well
as
the
articulate
music
of
an
imaginative
poet
places
nietzsche
among
the
philosophic
elect
of
the
race
showing
that
he
was
an
unstable
of
a
certain
type
will
throw
light
upon
his
malady
as
well
as
upon
his
life
and
work
in
a
set
of
volumes
entitled
biographic
clinics
george
gould
of
philadelphia
contended
that
the
ill
health
of
a
number
of
men
and
women
of
genius
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
due
to
unconnected
eye
troubles
in
attempting
to
bolster
up
his
thesis
he
has
collected
biographic
material
useful
to
the
student
of
personality
he
never
appears
to
have
asked
himself
what
was
behind
the
eye
trouble
the
evidence
relating
to
nietzsche
endocrine
personality
is
derived
from
some
of
the
data
he
collected
as
well
as
from
the
two
volume
life
of
the
philosopher
written
by
his
sister
and
the
other
biographies
of
him
extant
to
reconstruct
the
endocrine
formula
or
equation
of
nietzsche
inductively
one
should
analyze
first
the
information
available
concerning
his
parents
and
relatives
his
grandfather
was
a
conservative
bourgeois
of
a
superior
type
who
was
the
author
of
treatises
designed
to
narcotize
the
forces
of
rebellion
of
his
time
what
he
was
like
physically
no
epitaph
declares
his
father
was
a
clergyman
a
description
of
him
reads
tall
and
slender
with
a
noble
and
poetic
personality
and
a
peculiar
talent
for
music
that
ranks
him
at
once
as
a
the
mother
was
dark
and
had
a
fiery
temper
and
came
of
a
family
distinguished
for
the
powerfully
built
anatomy
of
its
members
in
the
heredity
of
nietzsche
the
father
appears
therefore
to
supply
a
pituitary
predominating
element
the
mother
an
predominating
element
nietzsche
himself
worked
strenuously
at
the
intellectual
life
after
when
he
probably
stopped
growing
and
the
brain
tonic
action
of
the
could
manifest
itself
early
distinction
rewarded
him
with
a
professorship
in
philology
at
one
of
prussia
wars
of
conquest
entangled
him
and
presented
him
with
diphtheria
a
friendship
with
richard
wagner
marked
the
turning
point
of
his
life
and
the
point
of
departure
for
his
works
on
the
most
fundamental
values
of
human
life
meanwhile
attacks
of
of
varying
degrees
of
severity
made
him
miserable
periodically
they
came
about
every
two
weeks
and
lasted
two
to
three
days
and
left
him
wretched
and
exhausted
at
last
at
a
species
of
stroke
terminated
his
sufferings
causing
him
to
lose
his
speech
and
memory
and
thenceforth
there
was
progressive
deterioration
physical
and
spiritual
with
repeated
attacks
in
the
sister
biography
there
are
several
good
photographs
and
reproductions
of
sculptures
of
nietzsche
at
different
ages
an
examination
of
the
frontispiece
picture
which
shows
him
in
profile
profile
views
are
the
best
for
physiognomy
as
well
as
of
the
bust
of
nietzsche
by
donndorf
exhibit
the
most
striking
traits
of
the
head
to
the
student
of
internal
secretions
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
face
emphasized
by
both
the
camera
and
the
artist
is
the
remarkable
prominence
of
the
arches
the
bony
protuberances
from
which
the
eyebrows
spring
this
is
a
definite
pituitary
character
the
eyebrows
themselves
are
luxurious
and
slope
to
meet
the
bony
development
of
the
face
as
a
whole
is
sharp
and
the
skull
tends
to
be
long
and
narrow
and
the
chin
is
square
all
these
point
to
a
personality
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
we
have
no
picture
or
record
of
nietzsche
caught
smiling
which
would
have
preserved
the
state
of
his
teeth
for
us
at
any
rate
considered
as
checks
to
my
interpretation
his
physiognomy
and
physique
the
nature
of
his
genius
and
the
attacks
which
finally
ruined
his
life
all
fit
into
the
conception
of
him
as
one
whose
life
centered
like
napoleon
around
what
was
happening
in
his
sella
turcica
the
attacks
of
diagnosable
symptomatically
as
migraine
were
so
devastating
that
in
after
the
printing
of
his
masterpiece
also
sprach
zarathustra
he
wrote
my
life
has
been
a
complete
failure
extracts
from
his
letters
collected
by
gould
provide
some
idea
of
his
suffering
in
just
before
his
stroke
he
said
i
have
in
my
eyes
a
dynamometer
of
my
entire
condition
the
history
of
nietzsche
eye
trouble
makes
it
probable
that
not
simply
a
defect
in
his
eyes
themselves
but
a
deeper
condition
behind
them
was
responsible
up
to
the
age
of
he
was
a
model
scholar
essential
eye
defects
of
refraction
should
make
themselves
felt
during
childhood
then
with
adolescence
he
changed
adolescence
is
one
of
the
epochs
for
the
pituitary
when
its
growth
and
enlargement
precedes
and
stimulates
the
ripening
of
the
sex
cells
in
the
reproductive
organs
until
adolescence
ended
and
physical
development
ceased
his
intellectual
interests
were
nil
and
he
was
particularly
backward
in
mathematics
colds
and
coughs
and
recurring
pains
in
the
head
and
eyes
bothered
him
colds
and
coughs
are
frequent
in
those
whose
pituitary
expansion
is
limited
by
the
bony
sella
turcica
to
any
extent
after
his
puberty
migraine
definitely
became
his
demon
companion
following
the
diphtheria
in
the
army
which
must
have
damaged
his
adrenals
the
attacks
grew
much
worse
and
complaints
about
them
more
bitter
because
the
pituitary
now
in
addition
to
its
own
burden
had
to
compensate
for
the
insufficient
adrenals
so
his
frequent
illness
made
him
more
and
more
a
subject
of
treatment
and
commiseration
if
only
my
eyes
would
hold
out
it
seems
to
me
at
the
age
of
as
if
i
had
lived
years
very
frequent
sufferings
of
stomach
head
and
eyes
acidity
oppresses
me
and
everything
except
the
tenderest
food
becomes
acid
i
can
not
doubt
that
i
am
the
victim
of
a
serious
cerebral
disease
and
that
stomach
and
eyes
suffer
only
from
this
central
cause
with
pain
and
exhaustion
in
december
he
fell
had
to
be
helped
home
lay
silent
for
two
days
then
became
loud
active
and
unbalanced
the
attack
was
preceded
by
the
drinking
of
much
water
the
specific
quality
of
the
nietzsche
genius
also
directs
attention
to
a
pituitocentric
to
a
pituitocentric
in
whom
both
and
are
extraordinarily
but
are
in
a
state
of
unbalance
in
which
the
gets
the
upper
hand
now
as
we
have
seen
the
makes
for
that
instability
of
association
between
the
brain
cells
which
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
originality
and
creative
thought
as
well
as
of
phobias
obsessions
hysterias
and
hallucinations
persons
in
whom
the
predominates
have
a
lively
fancy
and
are
liable
to
suffer
from
the
tricks
of
association
nietzsche
as
we
have
noted
was
poor
in
mathematics
and
in
the
calm
cool
proportioned
forward
march
of
scientific
thought
in
general
his
most
brilliant
ideas
came
to
him
in
flashes
and
gleams
that
is
why
so
much
of
his
work
has
come
down
to
us
in
the
form
of
aphorisms
and
paragraphs
he
was
essentially
a
poet
among
the
metaphysicians
which
again
favors
the
conception
of
him
as
a
with
a
dominant
yet
his
incisive
critical
faculty
as
well
as
his
love
of
music
also
document
the
supernormal
to
sum
up
the
physique
and
physiognomy
of
nietzsche
his
migraine
attacks
and
the
later
fate
which
overtook
him
his
likes
and
dislikes
his
tastes
abilities
and
accomplishments
followed
from
his
composition
as
one
with
domination
a
superior
thyroid
and
inferior
adrenals
darwin
as
a
neurasthenic
genius
charles
darwin
as
the
author
of
the
origin
of
species
and
the
greatest
revolutionist
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
naturally
had
a
great
deal
of
attention
paid
to
his
life
and
personality
yet
not
until
the
publication
of
his
autobiography
and
his
son
reminiscences
was
it
generally
known
that
he
suffered
from
chronic
ill
health
for
most
of
his
adult
life
johnston
in
an
article
in
the
has
marshalled
a
number
of
available
facts
to
sustain
his
thesis
that
darwin
was
a
victim
of
neurasthenia
now
neurasthenia
it
is
now
accepted
is
simply
a
word
corresponding
to
the
class
miscellaneous
in
a
classification
of
any
group
of
real
objects
and
as
has
been
emphasized
in
preceding
chapters
most
neurasthenia
rises
upon
a
disturbed
endocrine
foundation
most
often
an
insufficiency
of
the
adrenals
that
is
a
defect
in
the
chain
of
balance
and
compensation
among
the
internal
secretions
is
the
basis
for
the
weakness
of
the
nervous
system
the
term
neurasthenia
is
supposed
to
explain
actually
only
names
darwin
case
was
pretty
certainly
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
darwin
had
an
abnormal
fatigability
a
lack
of
stamina
and
endurance
in
mental
as
well
as
physical
application
which
plagued
him
from
the
late
twenties
to
the
sixties
as
a
child
he
was
strong
and
healthy
fond
of
outdoors
and
though
underrated
by
his
teachers
noted
to
be
possessed
of
intense
curiosity
especially
concerning
natural
objects
at
school
he
was
a
fleet
runner
and
cultivated
a
habit
of
long
walks
then
he
was
surely
no
neurasthenic
three
years
which
he
himself
afterwards
said
were
worse
than
wasted
at
cambridge
were
filled
with
shooting
riding
and
hunting
his
good
health
lasted
until
the
time
he
probably
stopped
growing
at
or
thereafter
his
troubles
began
what
was
darwin
so
far
as
his
endocrine
composition
was
concerned
in
the
first
place
his
father
was
a
variety
of
pituitocentric
of
the
inferior
type
six
feet
two
inches
tall
exceedingly
corpulent
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
son
the
sharpest
of
observers
and
the
most
sympathetic
of
men
he
wished
to
make
a
physician
out
of
his
son
in
order
to
carry
on
the
medical
tradition
of
the
family
erasmus
darwin
was
a
physician
before
him
his
son
however
showed
no
inclination
for
so
learned
and
confining
a
profession
and
had
to
be
reproached
by
his
father
in
these
immortal
words
you
care
for
nothing
but
shooting
dogs
and
and
you
will
be
a
disgrace
to
yourself
and
all
your
family
cambridge
came
after
edinburgh
as
he
was
rushed
from
medicine
into
the
clergy
but
in
vain
a
friendship
struck
up
with
a
naturalist
henslow
settled
his
career
for
him
henslow
heard
of
a
trip
of
general
exploration
the
ship
was
to
take
and
recommended
darwin
as
naturalist
the
captain
at
first
would
not
hear
of
the
proposal
because
of
darwin
nose
a
typical
pituitary
proboscis
but
his
prejudices
were
overcome
and
darwin
sailed
it
was
upon
this
voyage
that
darwin
made
himself
the
greatest
naturalist
of
all
time
and
at
the
same
time
infected
himself
with
the
virus
of
neurasthenia
at
plymouth
while
waiting
for
the
ship
to
sail
he
complained
of
palpitation
and
pain
about
the
heart
probably
due
to
a
transient
hyperthyroidism
brought
on
by
excitement
during
the
voyage
which
lasted
five
years
he
was
afflicted
often
by
a
relates
that
after
spending
an
hour
with
the
microscope
he
would
say
old
fellow
i
must
take
the
horizontal
for
it
and
lie
down
he
would
stretch
out
on
one
side
of
the
table
then
resume
his
labors
for
a
while
when
he
again
had
to
lie
down
already
fatigability
had
to
be
fed
with
rest
a
serious
illness
that
darwin
claimed
affected
every
secretion
of
his
body
acted
probably
as
the
exhausting
drain
upon
his
adrenal
potential
the
return
to
england
was
the
date
of
onset
for
a
record
of
continuous
illness
aggravated
by
his
marriage
apparently
for
his
misery
increased
progressively
after
it
so
much
so
that
he
was
forced
to
leave
london
altogether
so
as
to
avoid
the
strain
of
social
life
even
that
of
meeting
his
scientific
friends
or
attending
scientific
society
meetings
fatiguing
him
to
exhaustion
after
such
occasions
there
would
be
attacks
of
violent
shivering
with
vomiting
and
giddiness
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
impose
upon
himself
an
absolute
régime
of
daily
routine
any
interference
with
it
upset
him
completely
and
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
any
work
early
morning
was
the
only
time
for
physical
as
we
as
mental
exertion
evening
found
him
thoroughly
used
up
with
every
move
an
effort
insomnia
made
him
its
prey
a
curious
sensitiveness
to
heat
and
cold
distressed
him
in
when
the
origin
of
species
appeared
he
wrote
to
a
friend
that
his
health
had
quite
failed
and
that
indigestion
headaches
with
a
looming
hopeless
breakdown
of
body
and
mind
made
his
life
a
burden
and
a
curse
the
twenty
years
of
research
he
devoted
to
the
problems
of
evolution
were
one
long
torture
for
sixteen
more
years
during
which
he
worked
upon
and
produced
immortal
classics
of
biology
he
was
the
most
wretched
and
unhappy
sufferer
from
neurasthenia
his
life
was
a
continuous
alternation
of
small
doses
of
work
and
large
doses
of
rest
so
he
was
enabled
to
publish
volumes
of
original
writing
and
scientific
papers
living
a
sort
of
life
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
one
undergoing
a
rest
cure
for
years
he
thus
accomplished
infinitely
more
than
the
millions
who
have
led
the
strenuous
life
that
he
thus
survived
as
a
genius
among
the
perils
of
an
intellectual
nature
in
an
environment
for
which
his
adrenals
sentenced
him
to
destruction
must
be
put
down
in
large
measure
to
the
ministrations
and
good
sense
of
wife
and
children
who
supplied
him
with
the
endocrine
energy
he
lacked
all
these
details
i
have
given
in
the
attempt
to
analyze
the
internal
secretion
constitution
of
this
great
man
of
genius
to
establish
that
he
really
suffered
from
inadequate
function
of
his
adrenal
glands
for
the
symptoms
of
chronic
though
benign
adrenal
insufficiency
coincide
in
their
mass
effect
with
the
story
of
his
life
he
was
not
a
good
animal
as
herbert
spencer
declared
was
a
first
sine
qua
non
of
the
successful
life
he
was
a
poor
animal
the
poorest
of
animals
because
he
possessed
poor
adrenals
what
saved
him
was
his
congenitally
superior
pituitary
the
nidus
of
genius
and
the
overacting
thyroid
which
combined
to
compensate
to
some
extent
for
his
fundamental
lack
according
to
his
son
he
rose
early
because
he
could
not
lie
in
bed
and
he
would
have
liked
to
get
up
earlier
than
he
did
what
other
hints
have
we
that
in
spite
of
his
fatigue
disease
he
was
a
pituitocentric
the
record
of
his
physique
and
physiognomy
documentary
and
that
left
in
portraits
and
photographs
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
his
frame
was
naturally
strong
and
large
face
was
ruddy
and
his
grey
eyes
looked
out
from
under
deep
overhanging
brows
and
bushy
eyebrows
the
ears
were
large
and
prominent
the
hair
straight
the
nose
broad
and
well
developed
all
these
are
distinctive
pituitary
traits
the
photograph
of
him
taken
by
maull

in
shows
his
chin
to
be
the
square
firm

that
goes

frontispiece
of
the
collection
of
essays
entitled
darwinism
and
modern
science
edited
by
seward
and
published
in
charles
darwin
we
may
say
then
lived
the
life
of
one
with
a
hyperfunctioning

the
anterior

dominating
the

in
an
invalid
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
an
extant
portrait
of
erasmus
darwin
darwin
distinguished
grandfather
shows
a
pituitocentric
but
with
a
rounder
head
and
a
fatter
face
which
point
to
a
predominance
of
the
over
the
correspondingly
he
was
more
speculative
and
poetic
intellectually
than
his
grandson
and
more
irascible
and
imperious
in
his
moods
after
when
charles
darwin
was
years
old
a
marked
change
for
the
better
occurred
in
his
health
for
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
the
condition
of
his
health
was
a
cause
of
satisfaction
and
hope
to
his
family
he
was
able
to
work
more
steadily
with
less
fatigue
and
distress
afterwards
this
is
probably
to
be
explained
as
following
the
gonadopause
hi
him
the
cessation
of
activity
of
the
interstitial
cells
after
this
event
the
adrenals
in
the
male
nearly
always
function
more
efficiently
and
well
being
is
improved
even
though
the
blood
pressure
often
rises
coincidently
in
the
relative
vigor
of
that
decade
we
have
another
bit
of
evidence
that
the
adrenals
had
much
to
say
over
darwin
life
epileptic
genius
he
had
a
fever
when
he
was
in
spain
and
when
the
fit
was
on
him
i
did
mark
how
he
did
shake
is
true
this
god
did
shake
his
coward
lips
did
from
their
color
fly
and
that
same
eye
whose
bend
doth
awe
the

did
lose

julius
caesar
epilepsy
the
falling
sickness
or
fits
is
generally
associated
with
a
deterioration
or
degeneration
of
mentality
and
an
inferior
personality
is
frequently
an
ingredient
progressively
increasing
data
accumulate
to
incriminate
more
and
more
a
disturbance
of
the
endocrine
balance
on
the
side
of
multiple
deficiencies
as
the
basic
mechanism
at
the
bottom
of
a
good
many
of
them
concurrent
studies
reveal
that
abnormalities
of
the
thyroid
the
parathyroids
the
ovaries
and
testes
and
even
the
thymus
exist
behind
the
attack
investigation
of
the
content
of
the
consciousness
of
the
different
kinds
of
epilepsies
from
this
point
of
view
will
doubtless
bring
to
light
some
interesting
information
there
is
much
to
be
done
for
the
epileptic
with
this
new
method
of
approach
epilepsy
just
the
same
may
occur
in
men
gifted
with
the
sort
of
transcendent
ability
called
genius
mohammed
lord
byron
dostoyevsky
flaubert
to
name
a
few
cases
are
famous
instances
the
point
to
be
settled
is
whether
epileptic
genius
that
is
epilepsy
with
superior
ability
occurs
most
often
in
pituitocentrics
the
epilepsy
being
symptomatic
of
a
pituitary
struggling
against
barriers
tugging
against
bonds
as
mentioned
in
such
cases
epilepsy
appears
as
the
twin
brother
of
migraine
in
genius
should
that
be
established
we
should
have
more
evidence
for
the
pituitary
dominance
of
most
specimens
of
intellectual
power
as
a
case
in
point
let
us
take
the
most
famous
of
the
epileptic
geniuses
julius
caesar
when
the
fit
was
on
i
marked
how
he
did
shake
tis
true
this
god
did
shake
according
to
plutarch
julius
caesar
was
of
slender
build
pale
emaciated
of
a
delicate
constitution
reminding
us
of
darwin
subject
to
severe
headache
and
violent
attacks
of
epilepsy
in
view
of
the
work
of
cushing
the
concurrence
of
severe
headache
and
violent
attacks
of
epilepsy
is
sharply
suggestive
of
a
pituitary
origin
for
both
in
his
seventeenth
year
he
was
already
engaged
to
be
married
which
proves
his
precocity
an
overactive
erratic
pituitary
could
here
also
be
held
responsible
soon
after
he
was
proscribed
by
the
dictator
sulla
and
the
first
of
a
series
of
epileptic
convulsions
is
recorded
shock
tries
the
pituitary
as
well
as
the
adrenals
his
sexual
libido
was
of
the
quality
that
stimulated
his
soldiers
to
sing
celebrations
of
his
exploits
the
first
woman
he
was
engaged
to
be
jilted
cornelia
his
first
wife
he
divorced
on
the
ground
that
caesar
wife
must
be
above
suspicion
matrimony
committed
twice
thereafter
landing
him
in
the
divorce
court
he
devoted
himself
to
liaisons
one
with
cleopatra
this
sexual
hyperactivity
was
probably
another
pituitary
trait
the
compound
of
intellectual
and
practical
ability
he
realized
was
of
the
rarest
it
meant
a
most
delicate
balance
between
his
adrenals
and
thyroid
he
was
an
orator
politician
historian
conqueror
and
statesman
that
his
thyroid
functioned
well
can
be
deduced
from
a
career
which
involved
more
than
three
hundred
personal
triumphs
as
recognition
from
his
native
city
on
horseback
riding
without
using
his
hands
he
would
often
dictate
to
two
or
three
secretaries
at
once
the
masculine
love
of
glory
and
ambition
expression
of
a
was
combined
with
the
effeminate
echoes
of
an
equally
no
prima
donna
was
more
concerned
with
the
care
of
her
skin
complexion
and
hair
than
he
the
analogy
extends
even
to
superfluous
hair
which
he
had
removed
not
by
the
modern
electrolysis
but
by
depilation
with
forceps
and
main
force
the
attendants
at
his
bath
would
polish
his
epidermis
for
his
satisfaction
until
it
resembled
alabaster
or
marble
caesar
was
not
the
kind
of
great
man
that
darwin
was
and
only
a
rather
muddled
careerist
because
he
had
too
much
adrenal
and
but
he
was
pituitocentric
of
a
certain
type
we
possess
no
authentic
portraits
or
busts
of
him
to
go
by
but
the
bust
in
the
museum
of
naples
for
which
he
probably
sat
some
wells
among
them
will
not
accept
this
presents
the
sort
of
face
that
is
often
seen
in
pituitary
epileptics
and
the
features
and
skull
of
a
pituitocentric
long
large
head
eyebrows
prominent
with
tendency
to
meet
aquiline
nose
and
strong
chin
in
these
three
napoleon
nietzsche
and
caesar
we
have
male
pituitocentrics
exhibiting
diversities
of
life
and
tastes
because
of
differences
in
the
endocrine
glands
in
their
makeup
we
shall
consider
now
a
female
pituitocentric
who
presents
the
strangest
contrasts
in
physique
physiognomy
conduct
and
character
dependent
upon
a
variation
in
the
balance
between
the
two
portions
of
the
pituitary
the
legend
of
florence
nightingale
all
biographies
consist
of
prevarications
and
all
autobiographies
of
fiction
that
summing
up
of
a
mass
of
literature
over
which
industrious
students
have
ruined
their
eyes
held
good
until
after
the
war
when
things
changed
then
lytton
strachey
at
one
fell
blow
and
with
one
magnificent
masterpiece
hurdled
the
old
idols
and
established
a
new
standard
of
deliberate
accuracy
in
print
in
his
eminent
victorians
he
set
the
pace
for
the
host
of
those
who
have
been
stimulated
by
his
good
example
like
lady
margot
asquith
of
the
four
victorian
respectable
worthies
strachey
has
dissected
as
ruthlessly
as
the
anatomist
a
his
portrait
of
florence
nightingale
the
founder
of
the
modern
science
and
art
of
nursing
is
most
interesting
because
it
provides
data
of
the
utmost
value
to
the
student
of
the
endocrine
basis
of
human
personality
in
the
conventional
biography
of
this
superwoman
she
is
pictured
as
an
intellectual
saint
stepped
from
a
stained
glass
window
upon
her
wonderful
visit
to
a
earth
the
biographer
presenting
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
her
body
and
soul
as
he
has
makes
her
live
before
us
with
a
fresh
vitality
that
is
startling
the
species
of
life
florence
nightingale
lived
involving
as
it
did
struggle
with
a
masculine
world
and
conquest
of
it
implies
the
existence
in
her
of
certain
masculine
traits
and
marks
for
the
normal
feminine
psyche
is
submissive
rather
than
aggressive
toward
its
environment
human
and
otherwise
belonging
to
a
family
in
the
highest
circles
it
was
upon
the
table
of
her
destiny
that
she
should
become
a
regulation
debutante
careeristina
and
successful
wife
and
mother
instead
she
chose
to
question
the
whole
routine
of
the
life
of
her
class
and
in
her
diary
she
records
her
doubts
and
cravings
and
her
revolt
against
what
is
assumed
by
her
family
and
friends
to
be
the
normal
course
of
existence
for
her
the
attitudes
and
questionings
in
these
passages
the
religious
feeling
displayed
are
distinctly
masculine
most
easily
could
the
following
for
instance
pass
as
having
been
written
by
a
man
i
desire
for
a
considerable
time
only
to
lead
a
life
of
obscurity
and
toil
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
whatever
i
may
have
received
of
god
to
ripen
and
turning
it
some
day
to
the
glory
of
his
name
nowadays
people
are
too
much
in
a
hurry
both
to
produce
and
consume
themselves
it
is
only
in
retirement
in
silence
in
meditation
that
are
formed
the
who
are
called
to
exercise
an
influence
upon
society
in
a
she
puts
may
as
the
date
upon
which
she
was
conscious
of
a
call
from
god
to
be
a
saviour
now
the
vast
majority
of
women
who
have
remained
spinsters
at
in
spite
of
considerable
personal
attractions
and
high
natural
ability
are
visited
by
waves
of
emotional
fervor
for
a
of
the
self
but
in
the
case
of
the
subject
as
strachey
has
so
well
shown
the
call
was
pursued
with
a
pitiless
unscrupulous
determination
worthy
of
satan
himself
upon
the
most
ferocious
evil
bent
in
its
pursuit
indeed
she
became
what
her
latest
biographer
has
called
a
woman
possessed
by
a
demon
all
necessary
not
alone
because
if
she
had
been
meek
and
mild
she
would
have
existed
in
futility
but
because
of
the
high
percentage
of
the
masculine
endocrines
in
her
composition
it
is
most
regrettable
that
we
have
no
statement
of
the
findings
of
a
gynecologic
examination
of
her
that
she
was
almost
consciously
masculine
may
be
inferred
not
only
from
the
way
she
bullied
lord
pannure
and
worked
to
death
her
dearest
friend
with
the
angelic
temper
sidney
herbert
who
was
so
amiable
that
he
could
be
driven
by
one
who
wrote
i
have
done
with
being
amiable
it
is
the
mother
of
all
mischief
she
could
also
write
i
attribute
my
success
to
this
i
never
gave
or
took
an
excuse
yes
i
do
see
the
difference
now
between
me
and
when
a
disaster
happens
i
act
and
they
make
excuses
lytton
strachey
has
painted
superbly
all
this
in
his
essay
but
for
us
his
most
significant
passage
is
the
following
when
old
age
actually
came
something
curious
happened
destiny
having
waited
patiently
played
a
queer
trick
upon
miss
nightingale
the
benevolence
and
public
spirit
of
that
long
life
had
only
been
equaled
by
its
acerbity
her
virtue
had
dwelt
in
hardness
and
she
had
poured
forth
her
unstinted
usefulness
with
a
bitter
smile
upon
her
lips
and
now
the
sacredness
of
years
brought
the
proud
woman
her
punishment
she
was
not
to
die
as
she
had
lived
the
sting
was
to
be
taken
out
of
her
she
was
to
be
made
soft
she
was
to
be
reduced
to
compliance
and
complacency
the
change
came
gradually
but
at
last
it
was
unmistakable
appeared
a
corresponding
alteration
in
her
physical
the
woman
with
her
haughty
eye
and
her
acrid
mouth
had
vanished
and
in
her
place
was
the
bulky
of
a
old
smiling
all
day
long
then
something
else
became
visible
the
brain
which
had
been
steeled
at
scutari
was
indeed
literally
growing
soft
senility
an
ever
more
and
more
amiable
senility
descended
we
have
here
an
absolutely
typical
pituitary
history
with
another
case
of
pituitocentric
natural
ability
what
happens
when
pituitary
hyperfunction
or
superiority
becomes
underfunction
or
inferiority
is
precisely
as
strachey
has
described
so
cleverly
of
the
ministering
angel
the
acrid
thin
and
keen
degenerate
every
time
into
the
amiable
fat
and
dull
just
as
napoleon
was
transformed
by
the
mutations
of
his
pituitary
so
was
the
saint
with
the
lamp
and
in
both
instances
the
contrasting
modifications
from
one
extreme
of
glandular
function
to
the
other
supply
us
with
the
clue
to
the
secret
hand
of
their
inner
being
and
becoming
which
worked
upon
the
twists
and
turns
of
circumstance
about
them
as
a
sculptor
upon
clay
the
official
biography
by
sir
edward
cook
contains
three
portraits
representing
three
different
stages
which
bear
out
the
pituitocentric
thesis
of
her
personality
and
life
history
one
as
she
was
at
and
pictured
by
gaskell
she
is
tall
very
straight
and
willowy
in
figure
thick
and
shortish
rich
brown
hair
very
delicate
complexion
perfect
teeth
perfect
grace
and
lovely
appearance
she
is
so
like
a
saint
the
face
is
long
and
oval
of
the
kind
then
gradually
the
gained
an
ascendency
in
the
concert
of
her
internal
secretions
so
coloring
her
life
with
its
masculine
tints
and
altering
her
face
as
well
as
her
disposition
the
photograph
of
her
taken
when
she
was
shows
a
quadrangular
outline
and
all
the
acridity
that
impressed
strachey
the
last
picture
of
her
a
water
color
drawing
made
in
shows
a
round
visaged
old
dame
who
might
be
the
peasant
grandmother
of
two
dozen
descendants
little
patches
of
red
over
the
cheek
bones
remind
one
of
myxedema
and
indicate
that
toward
the
very
end
of
her
life
her
thyroid
failed
her
as
well
as
her
pituitary
so
that
our
biographer
relates
then
by
royal
command
the
order
of
merit
was
brought
to
south
street
and
there
was
a
little
ceremony
of
presentation
sir
douglas
dawson
after
a
short
speech
stepped
forward
and
handed
the
order
of
the
insignia
to
miss
nightingale
propped
up
by
pillows
she
dimly
recognized
that
some
compliment
was
being
paid
her
kind
too
kind
she
murmured
and
she
was
not
ironical
in
the
days
of
pituitary
and
thyroid
hyperfunction
we
may
be
sure
she
would
have
been
caustically
and
penetratingly
ironical
the
explanation
of
oscar
wilde
the
case
of
oscar
wilde
as
one
of
the
high
tragedies
of
english
literature
and
life
attracted
the
attention
of
the
whole
world
in
its
heyday
and
even
today
evokes
controversy
as
a
literary
figure
and
artist
the
poet
of
the
portrait
of
dorian
gray
and
de
profundis
belongs
without
a
doubt
to
the
immortals
as
a
convicted
criminal
who
served
for
two
years
at
hard
labor
in
reading
jail
and
afterwards
a
prey
to
chronic
alcoholism
died
in
obscurity
in
paris
he
still
remains
a
subject
of
whispered
conversation
in
private
and
his
crime
a
taboo
to
the
public
mentionable
only
at
the
risk
of
arousing
the
terrible
odium
sexicum
of
the
prurient
majority
oscar
wilde
was
a
homosexual
of
a
certain
type
in
view
of
the
previously
laid
down
considerations
concerning
the
endocrine
genesis
of
homosexuality
how
are
we
to
explain
him
and
his
natural
history
as
with
the
other
exemplars
of
genius
examined
we
need
here
too
to
gain
some
insight
into
his
internal
secretion
heredity
his
father
sir
william
wilde
was
a
surgeon
photographs
of
him
show
the
long
and
broad
face
of
a
centered
individual
with
a
corresponding
duplex
incarnation
in
the
face
the
upper
half
strikingly
spiritual
the
lower
curiously
animal
he
was
active
practical
and
eminently
successful
his
wife
recalls
florence
nightingale
in
face
figure
and
conduct
people
who
are
built
alike
as
regards
their
internal
secretions
are
those
whom
we
recognize
as
similar
physically
and
psychically
she
too
was
a
and
in
so
far
resembled
her
husband
but
as
in
a
woman
and
adrenal
superiority
make
for
masculinity
she
must
be
classed
as
a
masculinoid
type
of
woman
she
was
socially
aggressive
and
took
part
in
the
revolutionary
movement
of
her
time
in
ireland
thus
we
find
that
oscar
wilde
was
the
result
of
a
mating
of
internal
secretions
acting
in
the
same
direction
the
process
might
be
compared
to
parthenogenesis
it
is
on
record
that
when
enceinte
his
mother
often
expressed
the
wish
that
her
child
be
a
girl
when
a
boy
was
born
she
was
immensely
disappointed
to
compensate
for
her
disappointment
she
brought
him
up
a
good
deal
like
a
little
girl
she
had
him
dressed
in
girls
clothes
at
an
age
when
most
boys
are
violent
destroyers
of
clothing
she
would
hang
massive
jewelry
upon
him
for
the
delight
of
playing
with
the
resultant
stage
picture
as
a
satisfaction
for
her
discontented
desires
in
the
light
of
modern
psychology
and
our
formulization
of
her
endocrine
status
we
must
put
down
her
conduct
to
a
suppressed
homosexual
craving
had
her
son
been
built
along
the
lines
of
strong
emphatic
masculinity
her
influence
though
vicious
would
probably
have
found
no
congenial
soil
and
would
have
died
out
altogether
after
his
contacts
with
the
outer
world
beginning
with
school
no
matter
how
she
would
have
conditioned
his
vegetative
system
temporarily
his
internal
secretions
released
then
from
compression
would
have
asserted
themselves
and
determined
his
fate
differently
however
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
such
had
been
the
case
oscar
wilde
the
aesthete
the
paradoxer
the
disciple
of
walter
pater
and
baudelaire
would
have
stayed
in
the
land
of
the
to
be
born
i
mean
that
then
we
would
not
have
had
oscar
wilde
but
another
person
genius
or
commonplace
who
also
might
have
borne
the
name
of
oscar
wilde
that
was
not
to
be
the
singular
assortment
of
endocrines
that
mingled
their
activities
to
make
oscar
wilde
shaped
a
personality
which
we
must
classify
as
the
thymocentric
why
this
should
be
so
is
an
interesting
question
plus
of
his
heredity
should
make
two
according
to
elementary
arithmetic
and
the
rule
of
three
a
cancellation
of
the
two
factors
of
the
equation
rather
than
addition
seems
to
have
occurred
the
result
was
a
persistent
thymus
superiority
with
an
instability
of
the
other
two
main
glands
involved
how
do
we
know
that
oscar
wilde
was
a
thymocentric
because
in
his
fullest
development
he
exhibited
all
the
earmarks
of
the
thymus
pattern
we
possess
a
number
of
good
pictures
and
descriptions
of
him
as
he
was
really
a
contemporary
and
would
probably
be
alive
today
if
he
had
been
put
in
a
hospital
for
proper
treatment
instead
of
in
prison
an
excellent
description
is
that
of
henri
de
regnier
this
foreigner
wilde
was
and
of
a
complexion
seemed
to
give
still
greater
width
to
his
clean
shaven
face
it
was
the
glabre
face
that
one
sees
on
coins
the
were
rather
and
the
points
of
immediate
interest
are
the
height
the
complexion
and
the
beardlessness
one
classic
variety
of
the
thymocentric
is
tall
has
a
baby
skin
and
has
little
or
no
hair
on
the
face
a
passage
from
a
narrative
written
by
one
of
his
warders
confirms
the
last
condition
decidedly
before
leaving
his
cell
to
see
a
visitor
he
was
alway
careful
to
conceal
as
far
as
possible
his
unshaven
chin
by
means
of
his
red
handkerchief
bristles
on
the
chin
with
little
or
none
on
the
cheeks
is
the
inference
it
is
important
to
stress
the
thymocentric
significance
of
this
glabrosity
of
the
face
another
sign
to
be
put
in
italics
was
the
quality
of
his
voice
it
has
been
described
as
a
beautiful
tenor
when
he
had
it
under
perfect
control
and
high
pitched
and
strident
when
under
the
influence
of
passion
or
temper
such
a
voice
would
be
the
product
of
a
larynx
remaining
partly
or
completely
in
the
infantile
state
as
in
a
woman
that
and
the
large
breasts
he
is
said
to
have
had
point
again
to
the
constitution
all
in
all
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
oscar
wilde
was
a
case
of
status
lymphaticus
the
technical
name
for
the
personality
as
happens
in
a
number
of
thymocentrics
his
pituitary
must
have
attempted
to
compensate
for
the
endocrine
deficiencies
always
present
in
them
the
exceptional
size
of
his
head
was
a
pituitary
trait
finding
possibly
making
plenty
of
room
for
itself
to
grow
for
some
unknown
reason
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
it
reinforced
the
love
of
the
beautiful
that
is
part
of
the
feminine
nature
with
an
intellectual
ability
and
maturity
that
was
at
first
in
the
face
of
a
society
organized
for
pure
masculine
and
pure
feminine
types
disgrace
and
disaster
at
last
overtook
him
with
almost
the
ruthlessness
of
natural
selection
wiping
out
an
unadapted
sport
suddenly
cropping
up
in
an
environment
in
prison
he
suffered
from
severe
splitting
headaches
which
were
probably
due
to
changes
in
his
pituitary
described
as
being
directly
over
the
eyes
they
haunted
him
until
his
death
and
may
have
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
absinthe
addiction
he
acquired
the
treatment
of
genius
the
problem
of
oscar
wilde
raises
an
ethical
question
that
still
remains
to
be
finally
answered
granting
that
all
of
society
should
one
day
see
him
and
his
kind
as
a
peculiar
and
specific
constitutional
product
of
an
odd
intermixture
of
internal
secretions
what
should
be
done
with
him
and
them
it
is
easy
to
play
with
words
like
degenerates
but
still
we
do
not
condemn
imbeciles
idiots
or
defectives
or
other
substandard
subnormal
creatures
to
the
prisons
for
the
sake
of
the
good
opinion
society
would
maintain
of
itself
it
sends
the
latter
nowadays
to
hospitals
sanitaria
or
their
equivalents
where
protection
for
itself
without
punishment
for
them
may
be
practised
but
is
confinement
or
even
treatment
the
solution
for
we
have
to
consider
what
society
would
lose
by
cutting
such
abnormals
off
from
itself
and
them
from
its
stimulations
a
number
of
artists
have
been
built
like
oscar
wilde
musicians
in
particular
without
them
would
there
not
be
a
great
gap
a
yawning
absence
in
the
world
culture
modern
diagnosis
and
modern
therapy
might
have
done
a
great
deal
for
napoleon
nietzsche
julius
caesar
florence
nightingale
oscar
wilde
were
they
alive
today
and
willing
to
submit
themselves
to
scientific
scrutiny

might
have
relieved
napoleon
of
his
attacks
and
so
halting
the
creeping
degeneration
of
his
pituitary
made
waterloo
impossible
but
then
would
we
have
had
the
emperor
at
all
would
there
have
been
enough
of
that
instability
that
drives
on
the
genius
to
his
goal
nietzsche
might
have
been
relieved
of
his
headaches
and
caesar
of
his
epilepsy
but
then
would
not
with
correction
of
the
underlying
streams
of
activity
on
the
part
of
the
other
glands
of
the
internal
secretion
to
compensate
their
peculiar
superiority
and
distinction
and
the
fruits
of
their
lives
as
have
been
destroyed
florence
nightingale
too
might
have
been
a
softer
and
more
human
person
but
then
would
she
have
revolutionized
the
practice
of
nursing
oscar
wilde
possibly
might
have
been
made
over
into
a
heterosexual
but
then
would
not
the
world
be
the
poorer
without
de
profundis
let
us
ask
to
state
the
problem
in
the
most
general
terms
how
much
abnormality
are
we
to
tolerate
i
speak
of
course
of
malignant
abnormality
and
disregard
benign
abnormality
altogether
for
the
sake
of
the
valuable
that
is
concomitant
how
much
are
we
to
stand
of
that
which
degrades
the
while
it
raises
the
of
the
race
the
flowers
of
evil
destroy
or
modify
the
roots
change
the
seed
and
the
buds
will
bloom
if
at
all
not
orchids
but
dull
brown
commonplaces
what
means
may
be
licensed
for
the
attainment
of
a
worthy
end
is
perhaps
the
broadest
aspect
of
the
problem
the
instruments
of
ascent
to
divinity
may
arouse
his
instinctive
repulsions
dislikes
and
destructive
passions
the
study
of
the
internal
secretions
is
putting
and
will
put
the
most
powerful
apparatus
for
the
control
of
the
abnormal
into
our
hands
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
it
does
not
follow
that
because
we
are
beginning
to
understand
the
normal
that
we
are
to
establish
one
fixed
absolute
standard
of
the
normal
in
view
of
all
the
possible
mixtures
permutations
and
combinations
of
the
endocrine
glands
that
may
construct
an
individual
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
million
types
of
normals
for
normality
means
harmony
the
harmonious
equilibrium
between
the
hormones
which
tends
to
continue
itself
because
it
does
no
harm
to
itself
so
there
are
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
women
who
are
classed
as
normals
we
need
create
no
inquiry
into
the
value
of
raising
the
subnormal
to
the
normal
level
it
is
when
we
come
to
consider
the
possibility
of
lowering
the
supernormal
in
certain
respects
to
the
normal
that
we
pause
and
hesitate
traditional
morality
assists
not
but
hinders
us
here
whatever
the
race
may
ultimately
decide
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
it
is
now
somewhat
possible
and
will
become
more
and
more
possible
to
regulate
or
even
check
the
ills
of
genius
without
interfering
with
its
highest
evolution
and
expression
for
example
bernard
shaw
to
take
a
living
man
of
genius
is
pretty
visibly
a
pituitocentric
of
the
variety
he
has
the
height
the
facial
features
the
hands
and
the
sort
of
mentality
that
run
together
in
his
endocrine
he
also
has
the
headaches
it
is
quite
probable
that
feeding
him
pituitary
gland
extract
in
the
proper
dosage
would
relieve
him
of
his
headaches
a
process
might
be
started
in
his
pituitary
however
that
would
diminish
its
extraordinary
output
which
has
assisted
to
make
his
brain
so
brilliant
the
possibility
nevertheless
is
excessively
remote
as
the
pituitary
predominance
in
him
is
so
overwhelming
that
nothing
short
of
surgery
nature
or
the
medical
graduate
could
really
affect
that
overmastering
eminence
the
time
will
come
though
it
is
not
yet
by
a
long
long
road
when
we
shall
be
able
to
intervene
and
perhaps
meddle
in
nature
most
intimate
plans
the
right
of
the
power
to
modify
like
the
power
to
kill

be
defined

speculate
what
the

suffers
from
at
the

of
the
third

of
the

is

mankind
it
is
true
that
there
are
thousands
of
workers
scattered
throughout
the

to
the

in

but
they

the
crying

is
for
an
international

endowed

equipped

upon
the
proper
scale
with
all
the
available
appliances
and
methods
already
worked

such
an
institution
would
possess
the
right
chemical
laboratories
for
the
making
of

examinations

tests
of
endocrine

there
would
be

to

the

when

there
would
be

there
would

anthropoligists
to
note

measure
variations
in
angles

ratios
and
quotients
of
the
external
conformation
of

internists
would
record

there

a

with

but
we
may
glance
at
some
of
the
immediately
useful
aspects
that
might
exercise
those
concerned
with
the
everyday
life
of
men
women
and
children
the
endocrine
epochs
of
life
there
is
no
more
famous
classifications
of
the
epochs
of
life
that
mark
off
the
milestones
of
the
individual
evolution
than
shakespeare
seven
ages
so
different
is
he
at
those
different
stages
of
his
development
so
changed
his
body
and
mind
that
it
has
become
a
part
of
popular
physiology
that
we
are
entirely
made
over
every
seven
years
and
that
no
cell
in
the
organism
lasts
longer
than
that
the
tradition
certainly
does
not
apply
to
the
brain
and
nervous
system
for
the
number
of
brain
cells
is
fixed
at
birth
and
can
not
be
increased
only
decreased
because
they
are
too
highly
specialized
to
reproduce
themselves
what
transfigures
the
individual
as
the
years
go
by
is
no
simple
wear
and
tear
of
the
tissues
nor
the
replacement
of
old
cells
by
new
it
is
the
rearrangement
of
relationships
among
the
ductless
glands
the
shifting
of
influences
from
the
predominant
to
the
subordinate
and
vice
versa
in
the
constellation
of
the
internal
secretions
that
determines
the
unfolding
of
the
personality
the
transformations
raise
doubt
sometimes
as
to
the
reality
of
personal
identity
what
actually
happens
in
the
changes
from
childhood
to
adolescence
from
adolescence
to
maturity
and
so
on
is
the
sloughing
of
one
internal
glandular
dominance
for
another
growth
as
a
general
name
for
the
mutations
the
ensemble
of
somatic
and
psychic
differentiation
from
year
to
year
passes
through
five
epochs
that
are
standard
for
the
normal
the
normal
is
the
being
who
harmonizes
with
his
environment
and
yet
reacts
with
it
because
of
recurring
needs
within
him
his
endocrine
equation
settles
what
is
unique
and
different
in
him
but
the
gland
which
flourishes
during
the
epoch
as
its
time
of
triumph
when
it
has
its
day
determines
what
makes
him
like
his
fellows
from
this
point
of
view
it
becomes
permissible
to
speak
of
the
five
endocrine
epochs
similarities
and
resemblances
of
mind
and
body
between
people
at
a
given
period
of
life
childhood
youth
maturity
must
be
put
down
to
their
common
government
by
the
salient
endocrine
of
the
epoch
so
one
may
list
infancy
as
the
epoch
of
the
thymus
childhood
as
the
epoch
of
the
pineal
adolescence
as
the
epoch
of
the
gonads
maturity
as
the
epoch
of
whatever
gland
is
left
in
control
as
the
result
of
the
life
struggle
senility
as
the
epoch
of
general
endocrine
deficiency
infancy
as
the
epoch
of
the
thymus
explains
why
in
any
given
geographic
locality
the
babies
look
alike
and
act
alike
specialists
in
the
observation
and
treatment
of
infants
have
noted
that
not
until
after
the
second
year
is
any
tendency
to
differentiation
discernible
to
any
extent
among
them
it
is
only
after
the
second
year
or
somewhere
around
that
time
that
the
child
begins
to
individuate
and
distinct
individual
traits
and
a
personality
manifest
their
outlines
the
thymus
is
the
great
inhibitor
of
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
by
its
checking
activity
upon
the
other
members
of
the
endocrine
system
the
thyroid
and
pituitary
in
particular
it
gives
the
baby
time
to
grow
in
bulk
which
is
its
chief
business
during
the
first
two
years
of
its
existence
it
quadruples
its
birth
weight
the
brain
and
nervous
system
complete
their
growth
in
mass
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
recall
the
experiments
of
gudernatsch
working
with
tadpoles
who
showed
that
feeding
with
thymus
produced
giant
tadpoles
whose
metamorphosis
into
frogs
was
inhibited
while
feeding
thyroid
produced
frogs
the
size
of
flies
differentiation
occurred
without
the
preliminary
increase
in
mass
usual
as
differentiation
and
bulk
thus
appear
antagonistic
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
growth
the
function
of
the
thymus
at
a
maximum
during
infancy
seems
then
to
be
to
restrain
the
differentiating
endocrines
until
sufficient
material
has
been
accumulated
by
the
organism
upon
which
the
differentiating
process
may
work
after
the
second
year
the
thymus
begins
to
shrink
that
is
to
say
officially
its
involution
begins
careful
dissection
will
demonstrate
some
thymus
tissue
even
in
a
normal
subject
up
to
the
fourteenth
year
this
refers
to
the
average
normal
for
the
large
thymus
may
continue
large
and
grow
larger
after
the
second
year
in
the
type
of
individual
designated
in
a
preceding
chapter
as
the
thymocentric
if
the
thymus
retrogresses
after
the
second
year
what
takes
its
place
as
a
brake
upon
the
forward
driving
impulses
of
the
other
endocrines
we
have
every
reason
for
assigning
that
rôle
to
the
pineal
it
performs
its
service
mainly
in
all
probability
by
inhibiting
the
sex
stimulating
effect
of
light
playing
upon
the
skin
since
it
is
especially
a
sex
gland
inhibitor
the
thyroid
and
pituitary
become
freer
to
exert
their
influences
than
under
the
thymus
régime
and
so
we
find
that
it
is
after
the
second
year
that
thyroid
and
pituitary
tendencies
manifest
their
effects
the
pineal
era
from
the
second
to
the
tenth
to
fourteenth
years
remains
to
be
investigated
from
a
number
of
viewpoints
interesting
to
the
parent
the
educator
and
the
student
of
puericulture
precocity
is
directly
related
to
early
involution
of
the
pineal
for
just
as
the
thymus
involutes
at
the
second
year
the
pineal
atrophies
before
the
onset
of
adolescence
adolescence
is
the
period
of
stress
and
strain
throughout
the
somatic
and
psychic
organism
because
of
the
volcanic
upheavals
in
the
sex
glands
the
history
of
the
individual
is
dominated
by
them
up
to
or
so
when
maturity
commences
in
the
sense
of
a
relative
sex
stability
they
continue
to
exert
a
powerful
pressure
throughout
maturity
but
life
episodes
and
crises
diseases
accidents
and
struggles
experiences
of
pleasure
and
pain
as
well
as
climatic
factors
settle
finally
which
endocrine
or
endocrines
are
left
in
control
as
a
consequence
of
the
series
of
reactions
the
period
of
maturity
may
be
analyzed
into
the
interpretation
of
senility
senility
inevitably
follows
maturity
not
as
night
follows
day
by
a
mathematical
necessity
but
because
of
the
process
of
degeneration
which
ultimately
overtakes
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
dominant
as
well
as
subordinate
just
why
the
degeneration
must
occur
no
one
can
say
injury
to
the
endocrine
organs
of
one
sort
or
another
ranging
all
the
way
from
emotional
exhaustion
to
bacterial
infection
is
the
reason
usually
considered
sufficient
just
why
recuperation
and
regeneration
do
not
preserve
them
in
the
elderly
as
they
do
in
youth
is
a
problem
to
be
solved
when
we
understand
the
laws
of
regeneration
at
present
almost
totally
beyond
our
control
some
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
our
blood
vessels
those
tubes
which
transport
food
and
drainage
with
nonchalant
equanimity
to
all
cells
as
long
as
they
last
in
the
classic
phrase
a
man
is
as
old
as
his
arteries
ergo
his
ductless
glands
will
be
as
old
as
their
arteries
and
the
age
of
arteries
is
simply
a
matter
of
wear
and
tear
the
resultant
of
the
function
which
is
universal
among
molecules
arteriosclerosis
the
hardening
of
arteries
might
be
the
whole
story
but
there
are
certain
experiments
and
considerations
which
rather
confute
that
easy
explanation
or
at
least
make
clear
that
the
mystery
is
not
so
simple
the
work
of
steinach
a
viennese
investigator
has
contributed
most
to
the
elucidation
of
the
nonarterial
factor
in
senility
no
one
has
asserted
more
loudly
the
importance
of
the
interstitial
cells
that
fill
in
the
spaces
between
the
tubules
of
the
testes
in
the
male
and
the
follicles
of
the
ovary
in
females
rats
have
been
his
medium
of
study
for
they
are
most
easily
procurable
live
fastest
breed
and
withstand
experimental
and
operative
procedures
better
than
any
other
animal
an
old
rat
is
like
an
old
man
in
his
dotage
his
bald
shrivelled
skin
covers
an
emaciated
body
his
eyes
are
dimmed
by
cataracts
and
his
breathing
is
labored
and
difficult
because
his
heart
muscle
has
lost
its
tone
huddled
in
a
corner
life
to
him
has
become
concentrated
into
the
desire
for
a
little
food
and
immobility
if
now
something
is
done
to
his
sex
apparatus
a
marvelous
transformation
may
be
effected
that
something
no
one
could
predict
it
consists
in
slitting
the
genital
duct
which
leads
from
the
germinal
cells
to
the
exterior
after
the
operation
the
germinal
cells
which
grow
into
the
spermatozoa
atrophy
and
disappear
since
they
can
no
longer
function
as
if
released
from
some
restraint
the
interstitial
cells
however
multiply
enormously
with
their
multiplication
the
miracle
of
rejuvenation
is
performed
after
some
weeks
the
sluggish
currents
of
being
in
the
rat
which
had
slowed
down
as
a
preliminary
to
stopping
altogether
flow
fast
and
furious
waves
of
new
chemical
substances
inundate
his
cells
and
they
respond
like
the
fields
that
border
the
nile
after
the
annual
flood
all
his
tissues
skin
muscle
nerve
even
bone
are
restored
a
vitality
is
created
which
makes
him
bound
and
dart
like
a
youth
of
his
species
in
due
time
though
senility
returns
it
is
as
if
a
storage
battery
recharged
runs
down
and
becomes
dead
again
slitting
the
genital
duct
of
the
other
testis
causing
its
interstitial
cells
to
hypertrophy
and
multiply
repeats
the
effects
of
the
first
experiment
the
organism
responds
again
to
the
new
waves
of
vitality
that
vibrate
through
it
that
it
is
recharged
is
demonstrated
again
by
a
revival
of
sex
appetite
and
sex
activity
the
female
which
had
become
an
object
of
indifference
is
reinstated
as
a
creature
to
be
sought
and
pursued
the
second
period
ends
in
its
turn
and
now
entirely
new
interstitial
glands
in
the
form
of
fresh
testes
removed
from
a
young
animal
are
transplanted
into
the
body
of
the
old
rat
once
more
youth
returns
but
now
it
burns
itself
more
quickly
than
even
before
an
acute
exhaustion
of
the
mind
appears
first
then
all
the
other
phenomena
of
old
age
steal
back
upon
the
old
rat
and
senility
firmly
established
in
the
saddle
rides
him
to
the
end
the
possibilities
of
rejuvenation
whatever
other
deductions
may
be
extracted
from
these
experiments
they
prove
beyond
a
doubt
the
existence
of
an
endocrine
factor
in
the
process
of
aging
as
well
as
an
arterial
they
also
demonstrate
that
the
internal
secretion
of
the
sex
glands
well
advertised
as
it
has
been
as
the
elixir
of
youth
that
ponce
de
leon
and
with
so
many
others
pursued
in
vain
is
not
the
whole
story
for
if
it
was
the
duration
of
the
new
youth
should
be
another
span
of
life
whereas
in
actuality
it
is
only
a
fraction
of
that
time
this
fact
together
with
a
number
of
others
make
clear
that
while
the
gonads
may
be
the
jeune
premier
of
the
drama
the
vitality
of
the
plot
depends
upon
the
other
endocrines
since
old
age
is
an
exhaustion
permanent
and
irreparable
of
the
members
of
the
ductless
gland
directorate
the
reason
becomes
clear
for
the
temporary
quality
of
the
rejuvenation
effected
by
the
procedures
of
steinach
practically
then
the
question
at
once
arises
which
of
the
glands
in
particular
are
involved
there
is
first
that
ubiquitous
agent
in
the
system
the
thyroid
chemical
analysis
of
it
has
shown
that
the
iodine
content
decreases
with
the
age
of
the
individual
and
becomes
specially
low
after
forty
it
is
after
the
menopause
in
women
that
myxedema
the
disease
of
complete
degeneration
of
the
thyroid
and
of
the
physical
and
mental
faculties
is
most
frequent
the
thyroid
of
old
people
exhibits
in
varying
degrees
signs
of
a
similar
degeneration
thyroid
feeding
properly
controlled
will
clear
up
certain
of
the
deteriorations
of
mind
and
body
observable
in
the
aged
the
grossness
of
the
features
lessens
a
number
of
the
pains
go
muscular
endurance
increases
memory
and
intelligence
do
not
remind
one
so
forcibly
of
the
old
dotard
in
his
second
childhood
of
course
the
improvement
at
present
achievable
is
only
relative
but
in
the
prematurely
aging
decay
invading
a
half
accomplished
maturity
marvels
have
been
achieved
at
times
with
feeding
of
the
gland
the
pituitary
too
begins
to
retrogress
after
the
period
of
maturity
and
an
early
retrogression
means
a
short
maturity
in
women
the
onset
of
an
obesity
and
coincidently
of
a
lazy
and
dull
morale
coincides
with
this
declension
of
the
pituitary
powers
all
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
in
fact
shrink
and
shrivel
as
old
age
advances
only
as
in
other
relationships
the
predominating
endocrine
stamps
its
signature
more
visibly
upon
the
documents
of
decadence
than
the
others
pituitary
types
as
said
get
fat
and
slow
thyroidal
become
bulky
and
stupid
or
thin
and
sour
the
adrenal
dark
shrunken
and
forever
tired
of
life
so
type
emerges
even
in
glandular
deficiency
the
problem
of
rejuvenation
is
the
problem
of
recharging
or
replacing
all
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
at
least
the
most
important
the
thyroid
the
pituitary
and
the
adrenals
as
well
as
the
gonads
longevity
is
perhaps
largely
a
matter
of
preventing
or
postponing
their
wane
beside
there
is
the
prophylaxis
of
bacterial
infections
and
their
all
embracing
corrosions
which
too
have
an
endocrine
aspect
persistence
of
youth
or
juvenility
may
be
manufactured
by
nature
in
two
ways
there
may
be
a
persistence
of
early
glandular
predominances
we
have
seen
what
happens
to
the
thymocentric
that
a
juvenile
or
infantile
type
exists
may
be
safely
predicted
only
other
mode
of
securing
perpetual
youth
seems
to
be
by
prolonging
the
time
allotted
to
the
sex
gland
crescendo
as
for
the
golden
age
of
maturity
itself
what
humdrum
people
and
poets
have
despised
as
middle
age
the
margin
of
reserve
of
the
ruling
hormone
is
a
quantity
almost
malleable
in
our
hands
but
still
to
be
regarded
with
respect
as
a
hard
cold
proposition
by
the
physiologist
in
general
the
continuance
of
any
stage
of
development
means
the
maintaining
of
the
glandular
administration
peculiar
to
it
so
the
chubby
debonair
irresponsible
whom
nothing
can
touch
is
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
pineal
uncorrupted
by
the
years
while
the
genius
who
can
turn
out
his
best
work
at
must
thank
his
pituitary
for
standing
by
him
to
the
end
the
science
of
puericulture
there
is
a
specialty
now
growing
in
the
womb
of
science
which
in
its
own
good
time
will
come
to
fruition
as
the
study
of
the
child
needs
or
puericulture
even
today
there
exists
a
scientific
basis
for
the
formulation
of
the
principles
upon
which
every
child
should
be
brought
up
though
we
have
had
marvelous
results
from
the
campaigns
to
lower
infantile
mortality
most
of
what
has
been
done
has
been
medical
in
its
interest
and
so
largely
negative
in
its
accomplishments
the
removal
of
the
causes
of
evil
no
doubt
gives
the
good
its
opportunity
but
how
to
raise
a
child
endowed
with
satisfactory
ancestral
stuff
as
a
grade
a
normal
or
supernormal
still
remains
to
be
erected
into
an
exact
science
a
number
of
attempts
have
been
abortive
in
this
field
why
they
have
failed
to
arouse
the
ardor
of
the
parent
has
puzzled
some
of
the
pioneers
as
the
foundation
of
all
systems
of
education
has
continued
more
or
less
of
a
hope
rather
than
an
achievement
because
of
a
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
different
constitutional
varieties
of
children
a
certain
amount
of
attention
has
been
lavished
upon
children
needing
special
attention
those
mainly
suffering
from
insufficient
development
of
one
sort
or
another
in
the
last
decade
or
so
an
endeavour
to
focus
upon
the
exceptional
child
exceptional
in
intelligence
or
some
special
creative
endowment
has
started
an
interesting
movement
all
of
them
have
suffered
from
the
fallacies
and
troubles
of
the
pure
psychologist
who
would
handle
mind
as
an
entity
in
a
vacuum
a
realization
of
the
different
physical
and
psychic
educational
needs
of
various
children
will
arrive
only
when
we
see
them
as
built
differently
just
as
shoddy
and
silk
cotton
and
wool
alone
or
in
combination
all
possess
different
qualities
as
wearing
material
so
different
children
have
varying
capacities
for
the
wear
and
tear
of
education
the
endocrine
classification
of
the
human
race
applied
to
children
will
here
yield
a
harvest
to
the
educator
and
to
the
country
nothing
is
more
evident
than
the
diversified
nature
of
the
needs
of
the
various
internal
secretion
types
once
they
are
realized
as
such
the
history
of
a
thymocentric
type
for
instance
is
predictable
from
the
very
first
few
months
of
his
life
difficulties
in
feeding
in
habit
formation
and
adaptation
in
the
reaction
to
infections
in
social
play
and
so
on
one
may
expect
for
him
the
course
of
events
for
the
other
endocrine
types
also
follow
laws
of
their
own
it
will
be
above
all
in
the
of
children
their
reactions
and
powers
that
the
biologist
will
achieve
some
of
his
finest
triumphs
the
educator
will
have
to
take
account
of
the
state
of
the
pituitary
in
estimating
the
normal
intelligence
or
influencing
the
abnormal
or
subnormal
intelligence
as
well
will
he
have
to
consider
the
thyroid
in
the
child
whose
conduct
is
refractory
even
though
his
proficiency
in
his
studies
is
excellent
and
the
condition
of
the
adrenal
will
be
ascertained
in
the
types
that
tire
easily
and
that
seem
unable
to
make
the
effort
necessary
or
desirable
periodic
seasonal
and
critical
fluctuations
in
the
equilibrium
among
the
hormones
will
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
explanation
of
what
have
hitherto
been
put
down
to
laziness
naughtiness
stupidity
or
obstinacy
a
child
capacity
for
education
essentially
its
capacity
for
the
highest
and
most
productive
kind
of
life
is
limited
by
inherent
factors
these
factors
are
two
the
quality
of
the
nerve
tissue
its
ability
to
make
a
number
of
associations
and
the
quantity
of
the
internal
secretions
measured
by
the
maximum
obtainable
in
a
given
situation
these
inherent
factors
explain
too
why
children
born
and
bred
in
virtually
the
same
environment
show
the
most
extreme
differences
in
educability
that
the
differences
are
inherited
was
made
evident
by
galton
finding
that
the
chance
of
the
son
of
an
eminent
man
exhibiting
eminent
ability
was
times
as
great
as
that
of
the
son
of
a
man
taken
at
random
every
baby
then
is
born
with
a
combination
of
nerve
cells
and
ductless
glands
which
determine
its
capacity
for
mental
development
that
might
never
be
realized
but
could
never
be
exceeded
if
in
any
family
minor
differences
in
educability
are
observed
they
can
be
put
down
to
disturbance
of
these
two
factors
occurring
after
the
fertilized
germ
cell
had
started
to
divide
and
reproduce
itself
but
any
marked
falling
off
in
either
the
nervous
or
endocrine
factors
has
to
be
considered
pathologic
due
to
an
impairment
of
them
by
adverse
environment
recent
studies
have
amply
established
that
the
proportion
of
certifiable
mental
defectives
and
of
a
much
larger
class
the
subnormal
but
not
certifiable
class
is
progressing
by
leaps
and
bounds
it
is
perhaps
the
most
absurd
frailty
of
our
present
system
of
education
that
it
takes
almost
no
account
of
innate
differences
in
educability
to
spend
money
upon
the
teaching
of
these
children
along
lines
where
they
are
unteachable
is
not
only
waste
pure
and
simple
but
crime
for
it
deprives
the
educables
of
their
just
due
these
of
course
are
the
crude
and
simple
lines
upon
which
the
finer
and
more
complex
evolution
of
the
endocrine
problems
of
the
school
child
will
build
the
fine
art
of
education
itself
is
crude
and
gross
and
simple
compared
with
what
it
might
be
even
as
a
beginning
the
science
of
education
has
yet
to
begin
as
the
offspring
of
that
science
of
the
future
to
which
knowledge
of
the
internal
secretions
will
contribute
no
little
the
science
of
puericulture
vocational
education
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
avoid
becoming
merely
enthusiastic
upon
the
possibilities
of
the
applications
of
the
endocrines
to
the
educational
domain
happiness
for
the
average
individual
consists
of
a
double

success

upon

life
a
certain
hue
and
cry
has
been
raised
in
the
last
few
years
concerning
the
vast
and
overwhelming
importance
of
sex
in
the
happiness
and
even
in
the
successes
of
a
man
everyday
life
and
no
doubt
there
is
a
relation
sublimation
plays
its
part
in
the
explanation
of
vocational
idiosyncrasies
the
fact
however
that
perfect
success
in
sex
may
occur
with
absolute
failure
in
the
career
however
splits
the
problem
for
good
into
its
realities
a
physiologic
aspect
as
well
as
a
psychologic
so
as
school
education
will
have
to
take
serious
account
of
endocrine
anomalies
and
possibilities
will
the
institution
which
selects
and
trains
for
a
career
vocational
misfits
have
aroused
the
ardor
of
our
efficiency
experts
and
again
the
sweeping
psychological
attack
has
beaten
its
head
against
the
stonewall
of
ignorance
of
constitutional
predispositions
and
tendencies
of
material
the
attempt
to
erect
psychologic
types
for
vocational
selections
could
never
make
much
headway
because
it
could
only
flounder
in
a
swamp
of
metaphors
product
of
the
vices
of
its
methods
not
that
anyone
would
wish
to
discard
at
all
the
psychologic
mode
of
approach
but
no
science
in
the
sense
of
accurate
examination
was
possible
in
the
matter
of
classification
for
vocation
without
the
insight
into
the
physiology
of
the
candidate
that
the
analysis
of
his
endocrine
formula
will
provide
one
need
not
dilate
upon
the
value
of
such
an
examination
civilization
has
not
yet
learned
how
to
pick
its
personnel
and
so
artists
and
scientists
philosophers
and
politicians
financiers
and
religious
leaders
arise
and
survive
by
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
probabilities
and
chances
rather
than
by
any
intelligent
selection
and
cultivation
of

the
case
indeed
is
simply
a
subdivision
of
the
vast
subject
haphazard
muddle
in
the
conduct
of
life
a
cry
has
been
raised
for
the
superman
and
a
cry
has
been
raised
for
a
method
of
anthropometry
for
the
lack
of
these
two
it
has
been
said
all
governments
have
been
doomed
to
defeat
the
study
of
the
endocrines

by
no
means
supply
a
panacea
but
as
it
will
furnish
a
means
of
approach
to
the
determination
of
how
men
and
women
are
built
and
why
they
are
built
differently
no
one
can
gainsay
the
tremendous
advantages
to
the
nation
that
will
proceed
to
classify
its
population
accordingly
and
know
its
strength
and
weakness
in

of
the
actual
generators
of

suggestions
have
been
offered
in
the
preceding
pages
of
concrete
applications
of
endocrine
knowledge
to
the
understanding
of

of

in
the

personages
we
tracked
some
of
the
story
in
detail
this
vein
when
explored
will
quarry
untold
riches
it
has
been
observed
that
financiers
of
mark
like
great
musicians
are
special
pituitary
types
also
that
the
financiers
are
voracious
meat
eaters
and
the
musicians
inordinately
fond
of
sweets
differences
in
anterior
and
posterior
predominances
might
account
for
this
that
we
are
playing
here
with
no
phantasy
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
we
can
effect
changes
of
tastes
as
well
as
of
intellectual
direction
by
appropriate
feeding
of
various
glandular
extracts
just
as
much
indeed
as
we
can
influence

the

labor

as
well
as
the
large
employers
of

their

have
given
much
thought
to
the
problem
of
fatigue
just
what
fatigue
is
why
different

tire
at

why
some
are

must
have

and

of

fatigue
as
an
endocrine
deficiency
a
depressed
state
of
one
or
more
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
abolished
when
its
normal
functioning
is
restored
is
a
general
principle
from
which
departures
of
exploration
of
will
proceed
an
endocrine
organ
will
secrete
at
a
certain
rate
when
it
is
stimulated
excessively
it
will
eject
extra
amounts
of
its
secretion
how
long
the
period
of
excessive
stimulation
may
last
must
depend
upon
the
secretion
potential
or
margin
of
reserve
of
the
cells
varying
from
organ
to
organ
and
from
individual
to
individual
after
that
exhaustion
and
failure
follows
with
the
onset
of
the
symptoms
of
fatigue
a
pretty
demonstration
of
this
process
has
been
worked
out
in
the
electrical
stimulation
of
muscle
if
a
muscle
say
the
biceps
is
irritated
by
an
electric
current
it
will
contract
as
the
strength
of
the
current
is
increased
the
degree
of
contraction
becomes
greater
a
sort
of
stepladder
effect
of
increasing
contractions
may
be
thus
obtained
after
a
time
the
electric
shocks
can
not
cause
a
greater
contraction
but
only
a
lesser
and
if
continued
the
muscle
will
cease
to
function
because
of
fatigue
if
now
when
the
muscle
begins
to
lag
in
its
response
and
its
contractions
to
decrease
one
injects
into
a
vein
extracts
of
thyroid
parathyroid
or
adrenal
glands
they
will
immediately
reinvigorate
the
failing
contractions
the
injections
must
be
made
before
the
fatigue
is
carried
to
the
point
of
absolute
exhaustion
it
follows
that
these
glands
normally
pour
into
the
circulation
substances
which
counteract
the
effect
of
fatigue
substances
and
in
fact
make
possible
muscular
recuperation
from
fatigue
throughout
the
day
as
well
as
in
emergencies
and
crises
fatigue
conventionally
recognized
is
something
acute
and
urgent
as
such
it
means
a
violent
draining
of
the
endocrine
wells
but
there
is
also
a
chronic
fatigue
which
has
been
dignified
with
the
name
of

bernard
shaw
once
asked
for
someone
to
tell
him
the
name
of
the
germ
causing
the
symptoms
of
overwork
that
being
impossible
he
will
have
to
be
satisfied
with
the
answer
that
it
is
not
a
germ
but
an
internal
secretion
or
rather
a
defect
of
internal
secretion
that
is
the
cause
whether
or
not
the
adrenals
have
been
damaged
by
past
experiences

upon
their
capacity

a
quotation
from
sir
james
mackenzie
most
distinguished
of
modern
english
students
of
medicine
summarizes
the
matter
neatly
abelous
and
langlois
and
albanese
have
studied
the
relation
of
the
adrenal
bodies
to
fatigue
they
infer
that
the
muscular
weakness
following
removal
of
the
adrenals
is
due
to
toxic
substances
in
view
of
our
present
knowledge
of
the
physiological
action
of
adrenaline
in
its
various
forms
it
seems
more
probable
that
the
weakness
is
to
be
explained
by
the
absence
of
the
normal
tone
producing
internal
secretions
of
the
bodies
in
question
in
other
words
the
adrenals
regulate
muscle
tone
they
produce
nature
tonics
for
weary
tissues
the
chronic
lassitude
of
thousands
of
our
generation
suffering
from
that
tired
feeling
may
be
put
down
to
chronic
adrenal
insufficiency
it
requires
no
superlative
imagination
to
see
that
an
adrenal
poor
subject
does
not
belong
upon
a
job
that
involves
muscle
stress
over
a
long
period
or
indeed
fatiguing
conditions
of
any
sort
nor
that
a
thyroid
poor
individual
is
not
the
best
choice
for
a
position
that
demands
a
keen
alert
body
and
mind
in
the
selection
of
executives
the
nature
and
stamina
of
the

will
undoubtedly
be
taken
very
seriously
in
the
near
future
a

concerning

a
perverted
revival
of
the
ancient
phrenology
and

has
invaded
the

territory
in
america
as
the
newest
charlatanism
the
study
of
the
internal

including
blood
and
examinations
will
surely
assist
the
demand
for
a
truly
scientific
estimate
of

the

public

influences

they

measles
scarlet

mumps
and
the
others
have
long
been
accepted
as
providential
visitations
for
sins
known
or
unknown
that
children
had
to
have
them
and
were
better
off
when
they
had
them
has
become
part
of
the
tradition
of
the
laity
fostered
by
the
lazy
ignorance
of
previous
medical
generations
but
today
we
are
beginning
to
ask
ourselves
why
children
must
have
these
endemic
infections
of
their
age
the
pathologist
goes
farther
and
asks
the
reason
for
certain
apparent
immunities
he
asks
why
the
little
boy
who
sleeps
with
his
brother
sick
with
scarlet
fever
does
not
contract
the
disease
even
though
not
protected
by
a
previous
attack
determining
why
susceptibility
to
a
special
disease
in
a
particular
case
exists
will
constitute
the
greatest
line
of
advance
for
the
understanding
and
prevention
of
disease
and
so
the
perfection
of
public
health
in
the
last
influenza
epidemic
countless
physicians
were
puzzled
by
the
spectacle
of
men
and
women
in
the
pink
of
condition
carried
off
in
hours
while
puny
associates
were
either
passed
over
or
their
colds
pathologists
have
spent
their
energies
fruitfully
upon
the
infectious
causes
of
disease
the
microbes
and
parasites
especially
but
now
having
solved
most
of
those
problems
the
vital
question
of
why
an
organism
permits
itself
to
be
attacked
is
pushing
itself
to
the
front
why
a
peculiar
ailment
selects
its
victim
why
the
bacillus
finds
a
fertile
soil
is
the
neglected
problem
which
must
be
solved
before
the
abolition
of
disease
and
its
carriers
will
be
remotely
conceivable
long
ago
hippocrates
revered
founder
of
the
art
of
medicine
recognized
that
there
was
a
specific
affinity
of
disease
for
individuals
with
more
or
less
the
same
characteristic
somatic
and
psychic
traits
and
trends
tuberculosis
for
instance
was
noted
for
its
frequency
in
thin
persons
remarkably
optimistic
and
the
plethoric
choleric
nature
of
the
sufferer
from
gout
has
become
proverbial
before
the
era
of
the
great
bacteriologic
discoveries
of
the
eighties
and
nineties
the
concordance
of
esoteric
racial
and
personal
markings
was
a
great
help
in
diagnosis
to
the
physician
for
he
realized
though
he
sometimes
credited
it
to
his
clinical
intuition
that
it
was
a
certain
type
of
personality
that
was
liable
to
the
specific
disease
but
personality
and
its
reactions
normal
and
abnormal
are
determined
by
the
endocrines
so
we
should
find
that
particular
infections
run
with
special
internal
glandular
predominances
for
the
picture
presented

the

information
has
accumulated
that
the

comparison

the

assaulting
has
yielded
an
even
more
interesting
principle
knowing
the
state

reservoirs
enables
us
to
predict
the
liability
to
certain
of
these
infections
of
childhood
diphtheria
has
been
found
to
occur
most
virulently
among
adrenal
poor
individuals
moreover
they
are
left
poorer
in

afterwards
it
follows
that
they

that

injures
the

the

will
rarely
suffer
from
any
of
the
common

of

if
at
all
from

the

those
who
have

the
public
health
officer
of
the
future
will
be
armed
with
a
new
weapon
in
his
fight
against
the
spread
of
an
epidemic
he
will
be
able
to
classify
the
endocrine
traits
of
the
population
exposed
and
to
advise
a
course
of
glandular
feeding
for
the
types
specially
liable
the
schick
test
for
diphtheria
susceptibility
is
an
illustration
of
one
method
of
approach
to
the
problem
of
the
epidemiologist
in
settling
who
needs
protection
the
endocrines
will
assist
him
in
the
great
body
of
diseases
for
which
no
immunity
test
is
at
hand
should
another
influenza
epidemic
come
along
for
instance
the
proper
handling
from
the
endocrine
standpoint
of
the
thymocentrics
and
the
related
adrenocentrics
would
help
considerably
in
lowering
the
mortality
endocrine
types
have
other
tendencies
which
when
studied
and
controlled
will
decimate
the
great
assassins
of
middle
age
heart
disease
and
kidney
disease
with
accompanying
degenerations
of
the
blood
vessels
and
circulation
the
adrenocentric
tends
to
get
up
a
hyperacidity
of
the
stomach
and
a
high
blood
pressure
besides
certain
forms
of
diseases
of
the
lungs
the
thyrocentric
is
predisposed
to
heart
disease
as
well
as
intestinal
disturbances
the
pituitocentric
is
liable
to
periodic
and
cyclic
upsets
in
his
health
narcotism
the
craving
for
narcotic
or
stimulant
drugs
and
its
subvariety
alcoholism
has
been
found
most
often
among
the
thymocentrics
any
type
of
endocrine
inferiority
interfering
with
success
in
life
may
lead
to
the
habit
of
drug
addiction
as
one
way
out
but
the
blood
and
tissues
of
the
thymocentric
appear
to
become
habituated
to
the
narcotic
stimulant
more
easily
than
the
other
types
and
so
to
demand
it
with
a
physical
imperative
comparable
to
the
food
or
sex
urge
among
artists
philosophers
and
statesmen
on
the
other
hand
actively
productive
and
so
contrasted
with
criminals
and
degenerates
drug
addiction
has
frequently
been
a
mode
of
endocrine
compensation
that
is
the
drug
produced
temporarily
the
effects
of
the
internal
secretion
lacking
or
insufficient
thus
the
effects
of
cocaine
may
be
compared
with
the
effects
of
thyroid
but
while
there
is
a
normal
mechanism
for
thyroid
detoxication
the
cocaine
or
heroin
derivatives
mark
the
tissues
permanently
with
their
scars
and
deform
the
personality
the
hygiene
of
the
internal
secretions
all
these
protean
expressions
of
endocrine
determination
may
now
begin
to
be
looked
upon
with
the
hopeful
and
optimistic
attitude
of
him
who
understands
cause
and
effect
and
can
control
the
advances
made
in
the
last
ten
years
in
the
practical
manipulation
of
the
ductless
glands
from
without
the
introduction
of
glandular
extracts
by
feeding
or
injection
and
the
modification
of
their
structure
and
function
by
surgery
the
and
radium
and
other
procedures
enable
us
to
regard
more
confidently
the
problems
hitherto
accepted
as
the
insoluble
and
intricate
handiwork
of
fate
fate
may
have
woven
the
patterns
of
our
being
but
as
we
commence
to
probe
the
machinery
and
to
examine
the
looms
more
carefully
we
begin
to
understand
why
the
wheels
creak
and
why
there
are
seconds
and
odd
lots
in
the
product
as
well
as
the
rare
and
precious
firsts
moreover
we
are
learning
how
to
handle
the
machinery
ourselves
the
abdication
of
fate
can
therefore
be
confidently
expected
in
due
time
however
we
have
yet
to
begin
and
we
can
begin
with
prevention
the
theory
of
adler
that
some
organ
inferiority
is
responsible
for
much
unhappiness
in
life
has
received
much
advertisement
in
conjunction
with
the
doctrines
of
the
freudians
it
is
a
theory
of
little
scope
when
applied
to
the
eyes
ears
heart
and
so
on
because
only
a
small
minority
of
the
cases
are
of
that
kind
but
as
we
have
seen
a
deficiency
of
an
internal
secretion
an
endocrine
inferiority
reverberates
throughout
all
the
cells
not
only
the
mind
but
all
of
the
members
of
the
organism
must
strain
and
to
make
up
for
the
break
in
the
balance
endocrine
inferiority
is
indeed
the
most
frequent
organic
inferiority
and
we
may
explain
a
number
of
mental
types
upon
that
basis
thus
the
inferior
who
has
something
wrong
with
his
reproductive
organs
will
evolve
in
one
of
two
directions
if
his
adrenal
and
thyroid
are
of
poor
quality
he
will
become
the
secluded
introvert
shut
off
from
the
interests
of
normal
life
he
will
enter
the
borderland
of
insanity
if
pituitary
difficulties
supervenes
if
on
the
contrary
the
adrenal
thyroid
and
pituitary
are
present
in
a
certain
proportion
he
will
become
the
active
aggressive
keen
and
relentless
fanatic
reformer
a
woman
who
is
gonad
deficient
with
a
superior
adrenal
will
suffer
from
virilism
and
specialize
in
the
extreme
tactics
and
mythology
of
the
feminist
movement
a
number
of
life
reactions
are
classifiable
as
the
strivings
of
endocrine
inferior
individuals
to
overcome
their
sense
of
inferiority
the
unconscious
vegetative
system
and
the
system
of
consciousness
are
both
modified
by
the
weakness
of
a
link
in
the
glandular
chain
what
therefore
is
to
be
recommended
in
the
prophylaxis
of
the
natural
deterioration
of
the
wells
of
life
the
ductless
glands
for
even
if
we
may
be
able
to
replenish
them
when
they
dry
up
would
it
not
be
better
to
delay
their
dessication
the
hormones
reply
to
every
call
of
life
and
respond
in
every
reaction
the
normal
constructive
process
of
their
cells
remanufactures
what
has
been
lost
and
the
original
capacity
to
respond
is
restored
if
though
the
rate
of
destruction
and
loss
outruns
the
rate
of
repair
and
construction
they
will
be
permanently
damaged
this
is
what
occurs
in
shock
serious
severe
accidents
and
injuries
prolonged
infections
and
diseases
profound
continued
emotions
and
the
wear
and
tear
of
overwork
the
prevention
of
these
excessive
fatigues
of
the
endocrine
system
in
one
or
all
of
its
parts
and
especially
the
prevention
and
enfeeblement
of
the
diseases
of
children
which
injure
them
at
a
period
when
they
are
most
sensitive
to
injury
is
the
task
of
the
endocrine
hygienist
periodic
examinations
to
check
up
the
balance
sheets
of
the
hormone
factories
and
to
measure
the
amount
of
their
damage
by
means
of
blood
analyses
will
provide
the
most
valuable
method
in
the
campaign
to
lengthen
the
productive
and
enjoying
span
of
life
the
treatment
of
crime
endocrine
hygiene
will
discover
no
wider
or
more
fruitful
area
for
exploration
and
control
than
that
of
crime
for
more
than
a
generation
there
have
been
attempts
at
a
criminology
and
a
new
understanding
and
control
of
crime
in
the
united
states
a
concomitant
sentimentalism
has
concocted
measures
like
the
honor
system
which
naturally
failing
of
their
purpose
have
undermined
confidence
in
the
idea
of
scientific
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
crime
as
someone
has
noted
to
ask
a
criminal
to
promise
not
to
misbehave
when
discharged
from
prison
is
like
asking
a
typhoid
fever
patient
to
promise
not
to
have
a
temperature
above
degrees
the
next
morning
for
a
large
proportion
of
criminals
the
percentage
has
yet
to
be
determined
although
the
most
recent
police
commissioner
of
chicago
has
estimated
it
at
ninety
per
cent
punishment
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
letting
him
go
free
is
like
imprisoning
a
diphtheria
carrier
for
a
while
and
then
permitting
him
to
commingle
with
his
fellows
and
spread
the
germ
of
diphtheria
of
course
the
doctrine
of
responsibility
is
all
tangled
up
with
our
attitude
towards
and
treatment
of
crime
though
clear
thought
makes
mandatory
the
recognition
of
a
universal
cause
and
effect
law
practical
common
sense
has
defined
free
will
consent
or
the
withholding
of
consent
to
a
given
course
of
action
has
been
the
criterion
of
responsibility
in
practice
the
limitation
of
responsibility
will
depend
upon
the
insertion
of
extraneous
factors
into
the
formula
of
consent
the
pragmatic
test
has
been
and
will
be
the
probability
that
the
correction
of
the
somatic
or
psychic
condition
would
have
prevented
or
will
prevent
the
consent
to
the
crime
as
long
as
no
such
condition
will
be
demonstrable
society
for
its
own
protection
will
have
to
confine
the
unfortunate
individual
the
character
of
the
confinement
its
duration
and
the
uses
to
which
it
will
be
put
should
be
dominated
by
the
idea
of
discovering
the
unknown
criminal
predisposition
if
crime
is
an
abnormality
scientifically
studiable
and
controllable
like
measles
court
procedure
and
prison
management
will
have
to
be
transformed
radically
there
is
scattered
throughout
the
world
now
a
group
of
people
who
are
applying
medical
methods
to
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
crime
they
are
the
pioneers
who
will
be
remembered
in
history
as
the
compeers
of
those
who
transformed
the
attitudes
toward
insanity
and
its
therapy
the
insane
were
once
condemned
and
handled
as
criminals
are
in
most
civilized
countries
yet
the
criminologic
laboratory
as
an
adjunct
to
the
court
of
justice
like
that
associated
with
the
court
of
chief
justice
olson
in
chicago
remains
to
be
universalized
what
contribution
to
a
more
rational
treatment
of
the
criminal
will
the
study
of
the
internal
secretions
make
it
has
been
shown
that
the
greater
number
of
convicts
are
mentally
and
morally
subnormal
to
explain
the
subnormality
the
criminologist
has
conducted
and
will
continue
to
conduct
investigations
into
the
heredity
and
early
environment
of
the
criminal
his
education
and
occupation
the
social
and
religious
influences
to
which
he
was
subjected
and
the
intelligence
test
quotient
the
conditioning
of
the
vegetative
system
and
the
endocrine
status
of
the
prisoner
however
will
without
a
doubt
come
to
occupy
the
leading
positions
in
any
interpretation
of
crime
in
the
future
introspective
observation
of
states
of
mind
by
normal
persons
reveals
that
in
many
of
them
there
is
an
impairment
of
reason
and
will
power
in
others
an
exaltation
amounting
almost
to
hysteria
what
are
these
but
endocrine
states
of
the
cells
experimentally
reproducible
by
increasing
or
decreasing
the
influence
of
the
thyroid
the
adrenals
the
pituitary
crimes
of
passion
may
be
traced
in
no
small
part
to
disturbances
of
the
thyroid
a
psychologic
examiner
of
a
pittsburgh
court
interested
in
the
subject
has
found
an
enlarged
thyroid
in
over
ninety
per
cent
of
delinquent
girls
similarly
crimes
of
violence
may
be
ascribed
to
a
profound
break
in
the
adrenal
equilibrium
criminal
tendencies
in
women
during
menstruation
and
pregnancy
periods
of
mutation
in
the
internal
glandular
system
have
long
been
noted
a
kleptomania
uncontrollable
desire
to
steal
confined
to
the

has
been

we
have
seen
how
the
thymocentric
especially
if
he
possesses
a
small
bony
case
for
his
pituitary
is
predisposed
to
crime
a
recent
study
of
twenty
murderers
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
showed
them
all
to
have
a
persistent
thymus
and
the
thymocentric
constitution
a
study
of
the
recidivists
those
who
return
for
second
and
third
offences
in
one
institution
disclosed
that
a
large
majority
had
a
subnormal
temperature
and
an
increased
heart
and
breathing
rate
these
are
functions
conduct
normal
or
abnormal
being
the
resultant
of
the
conflict
of
conscious
and
subconscious
impulses
and
inhibitions
the
internal
secretions
as
controllers
of
the
susceptibility
of
the
brain
cells
to
impulses
and
inhibitions
must
be
held
accountable
for
a
portion
at
least
of
the
chemical
reactions
behind
crime
it
is
possible
by
treatment
of
the
thymus
to
cause
it
to
shrink
to
more
normal
proportions
it
is
possible
by
feeding
various
glandular
extracts
to
correct
deficiencies
or
excesses
of
their

and
so
to

the
underlying
basis
for

the
effect
upon
human
evolution
the
ubiquitous
and
influence
of
the
internal
secretions
upon
life
and
personality
comprises
but
a
fraction
of
what
is
known
and
only
a
hint
of
what
is
to
become
known
there
is
an
endocrine
aspect
to
every
human
being
and
every
human
activity
normal
and
abnormal
internal
process
and
its
external
expression
regulated
by
laws
of
which
we
are
beginning
to
catch
a
glimpse
their
control
promises
us
now
a
dominion
over
the
most
intimate
and
inaccessible
recesses
of
our
lives
in
a
way
comparable
only
to
the
control
we
now
exercise
over
the
forces
and
energies
once
revered
as
the
instruments
of
the
gods
light
heat
magnetism
electricity
we
have
learned
how
to
control
and
change
our
environment
we
are
now
learning
endocrine
research
is
now
discovering
how
to
control
and
change
ourselves
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
two
types
of
control
has
many
analogies
when
man
ceased
looking
upon
his
surroundings
as
inhabited
by
spirits
of
good
and
evil
as
he
conceived
himself
and
discovered
that
they
were
composed
of
things
malleable
and
analysable
in
his
hands
he
became
their
master
when
now
he
drops
the
old
superstitions
about
himself
as
a
spirit
an
emulsion
of
a
spirit
of
good
and
spirit
of
evil
and
sees
himself
more
and
more
clearly
as
the
most
complex
of
chemical
reactions
regulated
and
determined
as
are
the
simple
and
complex
chemical
reactions
around
him
he
will
begin
to
rule
and
modify
himself
as
he
rules
and
modifies
them
whether
or
not
he
will
ultimately
come
to
this
final
lucidity
of
thought
and
action
it
behooves
us
to
consider
some
of
the
uses
to
which
our
present
knowledge
might
be
put
since
every
step
of
the
daily
routine
or
adventure
from
waking
to
sleeping
eating
drinking
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
working
idling
fighting
playing
feeling
enjoying
sorrowing
every
shade
of
emotion
and
nuance
of
mood
in
short
every
phase
of
happiness
and
unhappiness
are
endocrine
episodes
in
the
life
history
of
the
individual
the
sphere
of
applications
is
as
long
and
broad
and
deep
as
life
itself
not
only
do
the
internal
secretions
open
up
before
us
the
great
hope
that
life
at
last
will
cease
to
stumble
and
grope
and
blunder
manacled
by
the
iron
chains
of
inexorable
cause
and
effect
they
provide
tools
concrete
and
measurable
that
can
be
handled
and
moved
weighed
and
seen
for
the
management
of
the
problems
of
human
nature
and
evolution
every
department
of
human
life
the
questions
of
labor
and

science

education
puericulture
international
problems
crime
and

may
be
illuminated
war
and

those
two
master
interests
of
mankind
may
be
understood
and
handled
sympathetically
as
they
have
never
before
the
reactions
of
man
alone
and
man
in
the
crowd
will
be
clarified
the
red
thread
of
individuality
which
runs
through
the
woof
and
warp
of
all
human
affairs
will
be
unraveled
inevitably
customs
morals
codes
of

and
practice
institutions
all
those
expressions
of
opinion
which
make

all
the
currents
which
contrive
the
infinite
variety
of
life
will
be
transmitted
into
another
set
of
values
a
remoulding
a
remodeling
will
take
place
all
along
the
line
manifestly
an
unstable
thymocentric
should
not
be
treated
as
a
criminal
but
treated
in
a
sanitarium
a
masculinoid
woman
needs
satisfactions
not
vouchsafed
in
the
old
love
honor
and
obey
home
how
absurd
it
is
to
found
codes
of
morality
upon
sermons
or
even
the
latest
psychologies
during
the
nineteenth
century
progress
in
physics
and
mechanics
overturned
traditions
thousands
of
years
had
painfully
toiled
to
erect
what
is
to
happen
when
man
comes
at
last
to
experiment
upon
himself
like
a
god
dealing
not
only
with
the
materials
without
but
also
with
the
very
constituents
of
his
innermost
being
will
he
not
then
indeed
become
a
god
if
he
does
not
destroy
himself
before
that
is
surely
his
destiny
for
better
or
for
worse
we
possess
now
in
the
endocrines
new
instruments
for
swaying
the
individual
as
individual
and
as
related
to
other
individuals
as
a
member
of
a
type
family
nation
species
and
genus
the
basis
of
variation
the
sense
of
likeness
and
the
sense
of
unlikeness
plays
a
decisive
rôle
in
the
diurnal
schedule
of
the
individual
his
sense
of
resemblance
to
his
father
and
mother
his
kin
and
clan
mark
him
and
them
off
against
the
cosmos
as
an
alliance
of
defense
and
offense
yet
no
matter
how
closely
he
is
like
them
and
they
like
him
he
differs
and
varies
they
differ
and
vary
with
a
sort
of
mutual
forgiveness
because
the
amount
of
resemblance
overtops
the
degree
of
variation
in
a
paper
on
the
rediscovery
of
the
unique
wells
emphasized
the
unique
quality
of
the
individual
and
how
in
spite
of
the
cleverest
devices
of
classification
living
things
ultimately
escaped
the
classifying
net
by
virtue
of
their
tendency
forever
to
vary
the
individual
is
unique
yet
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
fact
remains
that
between
individuals
there
is
resemblance
and
among
them
variation
what
is
the
reason
for
their
resemblances
and
what
is
the
cause
of
their
variation
the
conception
of
a
particular
chemical
of
the
individual
statable
and
relatively
controllable
in
terms
of
the
internal
secretions
supplies
a
more
rational
and
satisfactory
method
of
approach
to
the
problem
than
any
so
far
suggested
as
far
as
vertebrates
are
concerned
at
any
rate
in
effect
the
differences
between
individuals
may
fundamentally
thus
be
grouped
among
the
differences
which
distinguish
other
chemical
substances
the
difference
between
water
technically
known
as
hydrogen
monoxide
and
the
antiseptic
fluid
labeled
hydrogen
dioxide
lies
wholly
in
the
possession
by
the
latter
of
an
extra
atom
of
oxygen
in
its
molecules
all
the
peculiarities
and
qualities
by
which
hydrogen
peroxide
is
separated
from
water
are
referred
to
that
additional
quantum
of
oxygen
so
the
diversity
of
constitution
and
appearance
of
two
brothers
alike
in
that
they
have
inherited
the
same
internal
secretion
trends
may
be
traced
to
the
superiority
of
the
pituitary
of
the
one
over
the
other
variation
and
resemblance
are
large
issues
crucial
material
of
the
science
of
biology
upon
which
much
has
been
thought
and
written
that
the
proportion
of
the
endocrines
determines
variation
and
resemblance
heredity
and
evolution
is
a
hypothesis
advanced
supported
by
a
large
amount
of
facts
and
capable
of
the
most
interesting
experimental
verification
and
observation
if
a
child
resembles
particularly
either
of
its
parents
grandparents
or
relatives
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
it
is
because
their
endocrine
formulas
are
very
much
alike
when
people
apparently
not
at
all
resemble
one
other
the
same
law
must
hold
resemblances
may
be
partial
or
complete
and
the
degree
will
depend
upon
the
amount
and
ratio
of
the
internal
secretions
involved
the
same
endocrine
constitutions
will
produce
corresponding
physiques
physiognomies
abilities
and
characters
deviations
in
endocrine
type
from
that
of
the
original
stock
more
of
one
endocrine
and
less
of
another
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
phenomenon
of
variation
basic
for
the
origin
of
new
species
as
well
as
the
extinction
of
the
old
in
short
viewing
the
internal
secretions
as
determinants
by
their
quantitative
variations
of
a
host
of
biologic
phenomena
furnishes
a
concrete
and
detailed
foundation
for
darwin
theory
of
pangenesis
inheritance
of
acquired
characters
darwin
theory
of
pangenesis
was
an
attempt
to
harmonize
everything
known
in
his
time
about
heredity
it
supposed
that
the
various
organs
of
the
body
gave
off
into
the
blood
substances
themselves
in
miniature
which
were
taken
up
by
the
sex
cells
and
so
became
responsible
for
the
development
of
their
in
the
newly
forming
individual
modern
knowledge
can
not
accept
all
this
as
a
whole
but
in
a
modified
version
it
has
become
the
germ
of
a
theory
of
heredity
of
which
cunningham
of
oxford
is
the
chief
backer
beginning
with
the
traits
and
qualities
which
distinguish
the
sexes
grouped
as
the
secondary
sex
characters
he
showed
that
they
are
correlated
with
the
special
sexual
function
of
the
species
in
which
they
occur
these
traits
appear
only
when
the
hormones
occur
which
are
present
in
one
sex
and
that
only
when
the
gonads
of
that
sex
are
mature
in
some
cases
they
appear
only
at
the
period
of
the
year
when
reproduction
takes
place
disappearing
again
after
the
breeding
season
their
presence
makes
certain
cells
develop
in
excessive
numbers
at
a
particular
spot
in
the
organism
as
in
the
growth
of
breasts
from
a
few
sweat
glands
or
causes
them
to
specialize
to
make
hair
on
the
face
in
man
or
to
grow
antlers
on
the
head
of
a
stag
after
castration
the
hormones
being
absent
all
these
points
of
contrast
between
the
sexes
fail
to
appear
so
by
analogy
we
may
explain
all
somatic
and
psychic
differentiation
as
functions
of
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
contemplated
from
the
angle
of
the
effect
of
environment
upon
the
endocrines
and
a
reflected
action
upon
the
germ
cells
we
may
outline
a
mechanism
of
the
inheritance
of
acquired
characters
at
certain
times
and
consequent
adaptation
the
cycle
of
events
would
be
as
follows
a
state
of
lability
of
cells
at
a
point
because
of
increased
or
decreased
use
an
increased
or
decreased
appropriation
by
them
of
the
hormone
controlling
their
function
a
corresponding
increase
or
decrease
in
function
of
the
gland
of
internal
secretion
and
so
an
increased
or
decreased
representation
of
it
in
the
reproductive
sex
cells
in
the
gonads
to
take
a
classic
illustration
the
long
neck
of
the
giraffe
the
neck
of
certain
animals
living
in
a
district
populated
by
trees
with
high
branches
would
be
in
state
of
instability
if
at
the
same
time
the
pituitary
for
some
reason
was
unstable
and
reacted
with
an
extra
supply
of
its
secretion
it
would
stimulate
the
neck
cells
to
reproduce
themselves
in
turn
the
pituitary
would
become
stabilized
in
the
direction
of
increased
secretion
and
hand
on
the
component
of
increased
secretion
to
the
sex
cells
that
component
in
conjunction
with
other
factors
would
therefore
determine
the
emergence
of
a
definite
species
character
in
other
words
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
as
intermediaries
between
the
environment
and
body
and
between
the
body
and
the
reproductive
sex
cells
or
germplasm
tender
the
clue
to
a
phase
of
the
puzzle
of
heredity
adaptation
and
evolution
it
is
only
a
dotted
outline
of
an
explanation
to
be
sure
but
one
certainly
capable
of
being
filled
in
the
bearing
on
breeding
since
the
endocrine
glands
are
so
subtly
sensitive
and
responsive
to
environment
and
are
at
the
same
time
so
intimately
concerned
in
the
process
of
inheritance
a
law
which
sums
up
their
influence
upon
resemblance
and
variation
in
animals
there
is
no
need
to
stress
their
importance
for
the
practical
science
and
art
of
good
breeding
eugenics
another
mode
of
approach
to
its
problems
is
opened
up
and
fresh
enthusiasm
instilled
into
its
hopes
and
aspirations
a
method
of
analysis
of
the
factors
involved
together
with
rules
for
the
prediction
of
the
outcome
of
certain
matings
when
finally
worked
out
will
elevate
its
procedure
to
the
level
of
the
more
exact
sciences
a
man
chief
gift
to
his
children
is
his
internal
secretion
composition
the
endocrines
are
truly
the
matter
of
breeding
as
they
are
of
growth
they
are
the
material
carriers
of
the
inherited
physical
and
psychic
dispositions
powers
abilities
and
disabilities
from
the
soma
to
the
germplasm
and
back
from
the
germplasm
to
the
soma
all
kinds
of
questions
arise
as
soon
as
one
attempts
to
consider
the
bearing
of
this
underlying
principle
upon
concrete
situations
what
happens
say
when
a
pituitocentric
mates
with
a
thyrocentric
or
when
a
pituitocentric
marries
a
pituitocentric
is
there
a
reinforcement
or
a
cancellation
of
the
dominant
endocrine
is
there
a
quantitative
addition
of
internal
glandular
tendencies
in
the
germplasm
or
a
more
complex
rearrangement
dependent
upon
reactions
between
all
the
internal
secretions
the
term
endocrine
dominants
brings
up
the
inquiries
of
mendelism
and
the
relation
of
mendelian
conceptions
of
dominant
and
recessive
to
the
internal
secretions
the
mendelians
have
emphasized
the
rôle
of
the
unit
factor
in
heredity
and
the
conservation
of
the
unit
factor
as
an
entity
through
all
the
adventures
of
matings
also
that
when
unit
factors
say
of
the
color
of
the
eyes
come
into
conflict
brown
or
black
being
mixed
with
blue
or
grey
one
the
recessive
is
submerged
and
overlaid
but
not
destroyed
by
the
other
the
dominant
so
brown
or
black
eyes
dark
hair
curly
hair
dark
skin
and
so
on
are
dominant
while
blue
or
grey
eyes
light
or
straight
hair
light
skin
are
recessives
a
nervous
temperament
is
dominant
to
the
phlegmatic
a
number
of
psychic
qualities
have
been
declared
to
be
mendelian
unit
factors
memory
mechanical
instinct
mathematical
ability
literary
ability
musical
ability
and
even
handwriting
as
architects
of
human
qualities
the
endocrines
must
be
involved
in
the
mendelian
unit
factors
moreover
they
seem
to
act
upon
a
particular
locale
in
different
degrees
which
is
the
strongest
argument
against
the
resolution
of
a
number
of
structural
traits
into
mendelian
unit
characters
most
characters
somatic
or
psychic
are
the
products
not
of
the
action
of
one
internal
secretion
alone
but
of
the
interlinked
activities
of
all
of
them
the
amount
of
fat
deposited
under
the
skin
for
instance
is
influenced
by
the
pituitary
the
thyroid
the
pancreas
the
liver
the
adrenals
and
the
sex
glands
other
qualities
likewise
are
resultants
of
a
compromise
between
all
the
endocrine
factors
comprising
the
equation
of
the
individual
if
we
are
to
look
for
unit
factors
at
all
in
endocrine
heredity
we
must
look
more
deeply
into
constitution
and
measure
the
hormone
potentials
and
their
mobilization
or
suppression
it
will
in
all
probability
be
found
that
the
stability
or
instability
of
an
endocrine
will
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
part
played
by
it
in
inheritance
as
well
as
in
the
life
of
the
individual
an
unstable
pituitocentric
marrying
another
unstable
pituitocentric
will
have
children
either
exceptionally
small
or
tall
or
abnormally
bright
or
stupid
the
instability
tends
to
right
itself
in
the
next
generation
or
that
following
genius
as
a
sport
as
well
as
sudden
degeneration
of
family
stock
the
whole
problem
of
mutation
may
be
closely
connected
with
this
tendency
it
has
been
noted
that
the
extinction
of
species
has
been
preceded
by
a
great
increase
in
their
size
for
example
the
case
of
the
great
reptilia
of
prehistoric
time
that
possibly
represented
pituitary
stabilization
and
so
an
abeyance
of
the
ability
to
vary
necessary
for
fresh
adaptation
to
a
changing
environment
indeed
endocrine
instability
appears
the
fundamental
condition
of
the
tendency
to
vary
endocrine
stability
the
opposite
certain
endocrine
facts
in
relation
to
heredity
should
be
mentioned
the
daughters
of
mothers
who
menstruated
early
themselves
menstruate
early
animals
fed
upon
thyroid
during
pregnancy
comparable
to
the
thyrocentric
give
birth
to
offspring
with
a
very
large
thymus
comparable
to
the
thymocentric
women
with
partial
thyroid
deficiency
or
myxedema
bear
cretins
these
are
suggestive
of
what
the
internal
secretions
may
do
to
an
individual
in
inheritance
and
development
inherited
endocrine
potential
is
the
maximum
reaction
of
which
a
gland
is
capable
this
matter
of
potential
is
comparable
to
the
factor
of
reserve
power
or
margin
of
safety
demonstrated
up
to
the
hilt
for
such
organs
as
the
heart
and
kidney
as
varying
from
individual
to
individual
a
low
potential
like
instability
of
an
internal
secretion
gland
may
be
latent
and
not
made
manifest
until
the
proper
stimulus
the
maximum
amount
of
stress
and
strain
like
accident
disease
shock
or
war
arrives
when
the
individual
is
tested
the
effects
may
be
purely
local
because
there
is
always
in
the
organism
a
point
of
least
resistance
physical
changes
alone
may
be
prominent
or
because
somatic
changes
are
minor
the
psychic
will
dominate
the
picture
an
attack
of
the
blues
unaccompanied
by
any
demonstrable
transformation
of
the
bodily
processes
may
be
the
sole
symptom
of
an
endocrine
failure
somewhere
in
the
chain
due
to
hereditary
weakness
or
low
potential
so
we
may
account
for
family
trends
and
streaks
for
varieties
and
strains
among
individuals
upon
more
precise
lines
based
upon
endocrine
analysis
family
disturbances
of
the
internal
secretions
of
the
extreme
sort
denominated
disease
are
well
known
indeed
a
number
of
family
diseases
or
predispositions
to
diseases
have
been
traced
to
them
predisposition
in
any
direction
will
probably
be
shown
to
be
caused
by
them
within
limits
research
here
has
its
opportunity
the
improvement
of
racial
stock
a
vast
new
territory
of
inquiry
and
achievement
as
yet
totally
unexplored
is
opened
by
the
endocrines
to
the
eugenists
and
those
idealists
whose
most
earnest
aspiration
is
the
improvement
of
racial
stock
as
a
necessary
preliminary
to
improvement
of
racial
life
beginning
with
galton
they
have
brought
to
light
a
great
collection
of
data
to
prove
that
human
traits
and
faculties
good
and
bad
are
inherited
ability
has
been
shown
to
run
in
certain
families
and
degeneracy
in
others
yet
all
of
the
practical
net
result
has
been
summed
up
in
the
term
negative
eugenics
the
eugenics
of
prohibition
and
warning
now
the
concept
of
personality
as
woven
around
a
system
of
chemical
reflexes
handed
on
from
generation
to
generation
is
bound
to
change
all
that
and
to
create
a
structure
of
positive
eugenics
it
has
been
said
that
what
radium
is
to
chemistry
the
internal
secretions
are
to
physiology
just
as
radium
enlightens
the
chemist
about
the
history
of
matter
and
the
integrations
and
disintegrations
constituting
the
life
of
an
element
the
internal
secretions
illuminate
the
history
of
the
individual
as
part
of
the
life
of
the
race
and
of
its
integrations
and
disintegrations
seeing
the
individual
as
a
system
of
chemical
substances
interacting
will
assist
enormously
to
predict
the
nature
character
and
constitution
of
his
descendants
which
is
essentially
what
the
eugenist
is
after
the
study
of
matings
the
heart
of
the
matter
will
concern
itself
with
the
investigation
and
comparison
of
the
kind
of
endocrine
personalities
that
mate
the
internal
secretion
predominances
that
cross
and
the
consequent
endocrine
personality
of
the
offspring
data
bearing
upon
physique
and
physiognomy
details
of
anatomy
and
function
mind
and
behaviour
will
so
be
as
no
eugenist
has
hitherto
succeeded
in
doing
laws
of
endocrine
inheritance
will
emerge
that
will
bring
the
control
of
heredity
within
measurable
distance
standards
and
norms
of
a
new
kind
would
be
obtained
a
beginning
of
this
study
of
endocrine
inheritance
on
the
pathologic
side
has
been
made
some
of
these
have
been
along
mendelian
lines
following
up
abnormal
growth
making
giants
and
dwarfs
and
abnormal
metabolism
goitre
diabetes
and
so
on
it
has
been
stated
that
it
would
seem
that
abnormal
growth
is
dominant
in
the
male
and
recessive
in
the
female
while
abnormal
metabolism
is
dominant
in
the
female
and
recessive
in
the
male
if
an
endocrine
abnormality
like
a
goitre
or
cretinism
or
a
dwarf
or
giant
appear
in
a
family
as
a
sign
of
endocrine
instability
other
members
of
that
family
will
very
likely
show
internal
secretion
abnormalities
if
one
gland
of
internal
secretion
acts
as
the
centre
of
the
system
and
the
others
as
satellites
we
should
be
able
to
trace
what
happens
to
it
in
the
different
generations
does
it
maintain
its
supremacy
or
will
it
be
ousted
by
another
member
of
the
group
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
thus
be
able
to
advise
prospective
parents
of
the
consequences
of
procreation
and
to
forecast
the
meaning
for
the
race
of
a
particular
marriage
internal
glandular
analysis
may
become
legally
compulsory
for
those
about
to
mate
before
the
end
of
the
present
century
what
are
desirable
and
undesirable
matings
the
general
law
followed
by
nature
in
her
helterskelter
way
seems
to
be
the
production
of
the
greatest
number
of
hybrids
and
variations
possible
whether
for
good
or
evil
does
not
matter
certain
endocrine
types
appear
to
be
specially
attracted
to
others
belonging
to
the
same
group
thus
types
frequently
marry
the
type
of
male
the
strongly
masculine
mates
often
with
the
type
of
female
the
markedly
feminine
the
children
exhibit
the
lineaments
of
the
type
the
general
trend
seems
to
be
the
establishment
of
a
better
balanced
equilibrated
type
yet
the
children
often
are
apt
to
segregate
into
pituitary
dominants
or
pituitary
deficients
happiness
and
unhappiness
in
marriage
should
be
examined
from
the
standpoint
of
endocrine
compatibility
or
incompatibility
likewise
those
divorced
or
about
to
be
divorced
the
correction
of
endocrine
defects
disturbances
imbalances
and
instabilities
before
mating
presents
another
field
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
we
shall
thereby
in
one
generation
be
able
to
affect
at
all
the
germplasm
hitherto
revered
by
all
pious
biologists
as
an
holy
of
holies
no
one
can
deny
in
the
face
of
the
multitude
of
evidence
available
that
internal
secretion
disturbances
occur
in
the
mother
which
when
grave
offer
in
the
infant
gross
proof
of
their
significance
and
therefore
when
slight
must
more
subtly
work
upon
it
endocrine
disturbances
in
infancy
have
been
traced
to
endocrine
disturbances
in
the
mother
during
pregnancy
pregnant
animals
fed
on
thyroid
give
birth
to
young
with
large
thymus
glands
the
diet
of
the
mother
has
been
proved
conclusively
to
influence
the
development
and
constitution
of
the
child
as
the
internal
secretions
influence
the
history
of
the
food
in
the
body
they
affect
development
in
the
womb
indirectly
as
well
as
directly
certainly
whether
or
no
we
learn
how
to
change
the
nature
of
germplasm
within
a
short
time
we
have
in
the
endocrines
the
means
at
hand
for
affecting
whole
individual
that
is
born
and
sees
the
light
of
the
control
of
mutations
the
true
physical
and
intellectual
evolution
of
man
depends
upon
the
production
of
mutations
of
a
desirable
kind
that
can
survive
the
information
furnished
by
the
study
of
the
endocrines
concerning
the
genesis
of
personality
provides
the
foundations
for
a
positive
eugenics
a
eugenics
of
the
encouragement
of
desirable
matings
with
the
proper
legal
and
social
procedures
selective
breeding
for
the
production
of
the
best
endocrine
types
should
become
practicable
but
the
biologist
should
be
able
to
go
farther
if
the
eugenist
is
to
limit
himself
to
the
method
of
the
animal
breeder
he
will
have
to
rest
satisfied
with
the
characters
or
hereditary
factors
given
that
turn
up
spontaneously
in
an
individual
but
with
the
internal
secretions
as
the
controllable
controllers
of
mutations
the
outlook
changes
it
should
become
possible
to
produce
new
mutations
good
and
bad
to
speed
up
their
production
at
any
rate
the
feeding
of
thyroid
to
a
gifted
father
before
procreation
might
enhance
immeasurably
the
chances
of
transmission
of
his
gift
as
well
as
of
its
intensification
in
his
offspring
a
field
of
investigation
is
opened
that
would
embrace
in
due
time
the
deliberate
control
of
human
evolution
all
the
physical
traits
stature
color
muscle
function
and
so
on
offer
themselves
for
improvement
as
well
as
brain
size
and
the
intellectual
and
emotional
factors
which
have
dominated
man
social
evolution
the
general
prevalence
of
nervous
disorders
in
civilized
countries
visible
even
in
the
nervous
infants
the
specialist
in
children
diseases
is
called
upon
to
treat
shows
that
the
nervous
system
of
the
better
part
of
mankind
is
in
a
state
of
unstable
equilibrium
it
may
be
another
example
of
the
curious
coincidences
that
have
been
called
the
fitness
of
the
environment
that
the
investigation
of
the
endocrines
promises
to
put
into
our
hands
the
instruments
of
the
control
of
the
future
of
the
nervous
system
in
general
meanwhile
the
eugenist
should
strive
for
raising
the
level
of
the
endocrine
potential
and
discourage
its
lowering
that
means
the
encouragement
of
matings
in
which
all
the
internal
secretion
activities
are
reinforced
on
the
other
hand
those
internal

combinations
generally
leading
to
a
deficiency
of
all
of
them
which
produce
types
of
mental

should
not
be
allowed
to
occur
the
influence
of

what
suggestions
now
are
there
for
the
euthenist
who
would
control
the
influence
of
environment
upon
child
culture
there
are
certain
pertinent
facts
and
leads
that
are
worth
considering
in
analyzing
environment
one
must
distinguish
sharply
in
the
jungle
the
factors
from
the
living
for
while
the
nonliving
act
upon
the
endocrines
directly
the
living
act
upon
the
vegetative
system

produces
a
greater
call
upon

any

this

to
produce

certain

to

so
that

light
heat

stand
in
some
special
relation
to
the
adrenals
pigment
deposit
in
the
skin
as
protection
against
light
is
controlled
by
the
adrenal
cortex
the
reaction
of
the
skin
blood
vessels
to
heat
and
humidity
is
regulated
by
the
adrenal
medulla
a
change
in
the
adrenal
as
a
response
to
changes
of
temperature
and
humidity
in
an
environment
would
result
in
a
number
of
concomitant
transformations
throughout
the
body
so
variation
and
adaptation
are
probably
connected
most
europeans
living
for
a
sufficiently
long
time
in
the
tropics
suffer
from
a
combination
of
symptoms
spoken
of
as
punjab
head
or
bengal
head
the
condition
is
probably
the
result
of
excessive
adrenal
stimulation
by
the
excessive
heat
and
light
of
the
tropical
sun
followed
by
a
reaction
of
exhaustion
and
failure
with
the
consequent
phenomena
of
a
form
of
neurasthenia
in
the
section
on
the
pineal
gland
there
was
mentioned
the
relation
between
light
and
the
pineal
gland
in
growing
animals
and
how
it
serves
to
keep
in
check
the
action
of
light
the
earlier
puberty
and
menstruation
of
the
warmer
climates
may
be
explained
as
due
to
an
earlier
regression
of
the
pineal
under
the
pressure
of
a
great
amount
of
light
playing
upon
the
skin
all
these
and
many
more
could
be
cited
are
instances
of
the
direct
influence
of
environmental
factors
upon
one
or
more
of
the
endocrines
and
so
upon
the
organism
as
a
whole
indeed
stimuli
may
be
considered
to
modify
an
organism
only
in
so
far
as
they
modify
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
consequently
climatic
factors
will
tend
to
make
a
population
possess
certain
points
of
resemblance
in
common
varieties
of
the
human
race
exist
as
do
varieties
of
dogs
the
pekingese
and
the
fox
terrier
are
as
different
as
the
slav
and
latin
are
different
because
of
differences
in
internal
secretion
the
slav
peasant
is
definitely
subthyroid
in
his
general
effect
round
head
coarse
features
stubby
hands
and
his
stolid
brooding
intellectual
and
emotional
reaction
the
latin
shows
a
pronounced
adrenal
streak
in
his
coloration
his
emotivity
his
susceptibility
to
neurosis
and
psychosis
laing
gordon
a
scot
physician
reported
that
of
cases
he
studied
more
than
twice
as
many
of
duplex

individuals
brown

black
most
often
were
susceptible
to
the
mental
disturbances
of

as
the

blue
or
most
often
he
also
pointed
out
that
such
individuals
tend
to
have
a
narrow
and
abnormally
arched
palate
the
tends
to
be
more
sharply
pituitarized
his

are
more
his
mentality
more
stable
the
frenchman
is
rather
a
cross
between
the
and
the
italian
or
spanish
so
national
resemblances
traceable
to
climatic
influences
being
repeated
from
generation
to
generation
upon
the
endocrines
may
be
explained
physiologically
the
physiologic
interpretation
of
history
will
indeed
be
found
the
broadest
including
as
complementary
climatic
theory
hegel
ideas
on
the
influence
of

and
on
the
superiority
of
the
economic
motives
and
forces
the
races
of
mankind
arthur
keith
conservator
of
the
museum
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
of
england
was
the
first
to
apply
the
principle
of
endocrine
differentiation
to
the
problem
of
the
the
lines
which
have
divided
mankind
crudely
into
the
yellow
the
red
the
white
and
the
brown
the
negro
the
mongol
the
caucasian
the
copper
tinted
american
it
has
long
been
recognized
by
anthropologists
that
the
differences
of
color
march
with
differences
in
every
comparable
trait
thus
the
ideal
negro
is
built
upon
a
pattern
in
which
all
the
elements
are
specific
and
singular
when
the
looms
revolve
that
make
him
there
is
produced
a
gleaming
black
skin
kinky
black
hair
squat
nose
thick
protruding
lips
large
striking
teeth
prominent
jaws
and
staring
eyes
as
his
upright
carriage
and
proportions
are
distinctive
so
are
his
musical
voice
and
his
easily
wrought
upon
nerves
in
contrast
the
caucasian
has
a
good
deal
of
hair
on
his
body
his
skin
is
a
pale
his
lips
are
thin
and
his
nose
especially
has
the
definite
bridge
which
narrows
it
the
mongol
like
the
negro
has
the
hairless
body
and
the
beardless
face
but
unlike
him
has
lank
straight
hair
on
his
head
while
his
features
are
flattened
and
upon
the
basis
of
these
structural
functional
and
mental
differences
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
evolution
of
which
in
the
race
as
in
the
individual
is
guided
by
the
glands
of
internal
secretion
keith
presents
a
very
good
case
for
the
view
that
the
white
man
is
an
example
of
relative
excess
of
the
pituitary
thyroid
adrenal
and
gonad
endocrines
the
sharp
and
pronounced
nasalization
of
the
face
the
tendency
to
strong
eyebrow
ridges
the
prominent
chin
the
tendency
to
bulk
of
body
and
height
of
stature
in
the
majority
of
europeans
are
the
signs
of
pituitary
dominance
keith
is
also
of
the
opinion
that
the
sexual
differentiation
the
robust
manifestations
of
the
male
characters
is
more
emphatic
in
the
caucasian
than
in
either
the
mongol
or
negro
racial
types
in
certain
negro
types
especially
in
nilotic
tribes
with
their
long
legs
we
seem
to
have
a
manifestation
of
abeyance
in
the
action
of
the
interstitial
glands
as
for
the
adrenal
superiority
of
the
white
man
it
is
years
since
john
hunter
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
original
color
of
man
skin
was
black
and
all
the
knowledge
that
we
have
gathered
since
his
supports
the
inference
he
drew
from
the
fact
that
pigment
begins
to
collect
and
thus
darken
the
skin
when
the
adrenal
bodies
become
the
seat
of
a
destructive
disease
we
infer
that
they
have
to
do
with
the
clearing
away
of
pigment
and
that
we
europeans
owe
the
fairness
of
our
skins
to
some
particular
virtue
resident
in
the
adrenal
bodies
finally
as
regards
the
thyroid
a
comparison
of
the
face
of
a
cretin
with
that
of
the
negro
or
mongol
tells
the
story
a
certain
variety
of
idiocy
mongolian
idiocy
in
which
the
face
simulates
cretinism
so
closely
as
to
deceive
practised
clinical
observers
is
characterized
by
a
chinese
cast
of
the
features
and
eyes
hence
the
name
and
in
the
bushman
of
south
africa
the
face
is
even
more
startlingly
recalled
there
is
every
reason
then
for
believing
that
the
white
man
possesses
more
of
pituitary
adrenal
gonad
and
thyroid
internal
secretions
as
compared
with
the
yellow
man
or
black
man
and
since
these
endocrines
control
not
only
physique
and
physiognomy
anatomic
and
functional
minutiae
but
also
mind
and
behaviour
we
are
justified
in
putting
down
the
white
man
predominance
on
the
planet
to
a
greater
concentration
in
his
blood
of
the
omnipotent
hormones
while
the
negro
is
relatively
subadrenal
the
mongol
is
relatively
subthyroid
their
relative
deficiency
in
internal
secretions
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
white
man
burden
man
attitude
toward
himself
a
last
but
by
no
means
least
application
we
may
consider
of
the
developing
knowledge
of
the
internal
secretions
in
relation
to
human
evolution
is
its
effect
upon
man
attitude
toward
himself
and
so
toward
his
fellow
men
whatever
else
he
is
man
is
a
land
animal
with
ideas
that
makes
him
a

in
a
word
he
is
the
last
word
of
mind
working
upon

but
persistently
he
has
refused
to
recognize
himself
as

and
as
subject
to
the
laws
to
the
physics
and
chemistry
of

history
consists
of
the
protocols
that
record
the
high
lights
of
the

is
the
adventure
of

now
for

it

not

to
assert
the

views
upon

of

because
it
was
without

the

so

a

could
only

the

be
changed
a

is
already
in

the
absolute

will
come
nor
need
anyone
fear
that
the

in

will
signify
the

the

can
be
the

the

control
will
not
necessarily
interfere
with
the

the

of

yet
come

they
open

a

a
