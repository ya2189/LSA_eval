courts
and
criminals
by
arthur
train
these
essays
which
were
written
between
the
years
are
reprinted
without
revision
although
in
a
few
minor
instances
the
laws
may
have
been
changed
chapter
i
the
pleasant
fiction
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
there
was
a
great
some
years
ago
in
the
city
of
new
york
over
an
young
person
duffy
by
name
who
falling
into
the
bad
graces
of
the
police
was
most
incontinently
dragged
to
headquarters
and
mugged
without
so
much
as
by
your
leave
sir
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
having
been
photographed
and
measured
in
most
humiliating
fashion
he
was
turned
loose
with
a
gratuitous
warning
to
behave
himself
in
the
future
and
see
to
it
that
he
did
nothing
which
might
gain
him
even
more
invidious
treatment
now
although
many
thousands
of
equally
harmless
persons
had
been
similarly
treated
this
particular
outrage
was
made
the
occasion
of
a
vehement
protest
to
the
mayor
of
the
city
by
a
certain
member
of
the
judiciary
who
pointed
out
that
such
things
in
a
civilized
community
were
shocking
beyond
measure
and
called
upon
the
mayor
to
remove
the
commissioner
of
police
and
all
his
staff
of
deputy
commissioners
for
openly
violating
the
law
which
they
were
sworn
to
uphold
but
the
commissioner
of
police
who
had
sometimes
enforced
the
penal
statutes
in
a
way
to
make
him
unpopular
with
machine
politicians
saw
nothing
wrong
in
what
he
had
done
and
what
was
more
said
so
most
outspokenly
the
judge
said
you
did
and
the
commissioner
said
i
did
specifically
the
judge
was
complaining
of
what
had
been
done
to
duffy
but
more
generally
he
was
charging
the
police
with
despotism
and
oppression
and
with
systematically
disregarding
the
sacred
liberties
of
the
citizens
which
it
was
their
duty
to
protect
accordingly
the
mayor
decided
to
look
into
the
matter
for
himself
and
after
a
lengthy
investigation
came
to
the
alleged
conclusion
that
the
mugging
of
duffy
was
a
most
reprehensible
thing
and
that
all
those
who
were
guilty
of
having
any
part
therein
should
be
instantly
removed
from
office
he
therefore
issued
a
pronunciamento
to
the
commissioner
demanding
the
official
heads
of
several
of
his
subordinates
which
order
the
commissioner
politely
declined
to
obey
the
mayor
thereupon
removed
him
and
appointed
a
successor
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
having
in
the
office
a
man
who
should
conduct
the
police
business
of
the
city
with
more
regard
for
the
liberties
of
the
inhabitants
thereof
the
judge
who
had
started
the
rumpus
expressed
himself
as
very
much
pleased
and
declared
that
now
at
last
a
new
era
had
dawned
wherein
the
government
was
to
be
administered
with
a
due
regard
for
law
now
curiously
enough
although
the
judge
had
demanded
the
removal
of
the
commissioner
on
the
ground
that
he
had
violated
the
law
and
been
guilty
of
tyrannous
and
despotic
conduct
the
mayor
had
ousted
him
not
for
pursuing
an
illegal
course
in
arresting
and
mugging
a
presumptively
innocent
man
for
illegal
it
most
undoubtedly
was
but
for
inefficiency
and
maladministration
in
his
department
said
the
mayor
in
his
written
opinion
after
thinking
over
this
matter
with
the
greatest
care
i
am
led
to
the
conclusion
that
as
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
i
should
not
order
the
police
to
stop
taking
photographs
of
people
arrested
and
accused
of
crime
or
who
have
been
indicted
by
grand
juries
that
grave
injustice
may
occur
the
duffy
case
has
demonstrated
but
i
feel
that
it
is
not
the
taking
of
the
photograph
that
has
given
cause
to
the
injustice
but
the
inefficiency
and
maladministration
of
the
police
department
etc
in
other
words
the
mayor
set
the
seal
of
his
official
approval
upon
the
very
practice
which
caused
the
injustice
to
duffy
mugging
was
all
right
so
long
as
you
mugged
the
right
persons
the
situation
thus
outlined
was
one
of
more
than
passing
interest
a
sensitive
point
in
our
governmental
nervous
system
had
been
touched
and
a
condition
uncovered
that
sooner
or
later
must
be
diagnosed
and
cured
for
the
police
have
no
right
to
arrest
and
photograph
a
citizen
unconvicted
of
crime
since
it
is
contrary
to
law
and
it
is
ridiculous
to
assert
that
the
very
guardians
of
the
law
may
violate
it
so
long
as
they
do
so
judiciously
and
do
not
molest
the
duffys
the
trouble
goes
deeper
than
that
the
truth
is
that
we
are
up
against
that
most
delicate
of
situations
the
concrete
adjustment
of
a
theoretical
individual
right
to
a
practical
necessity
the
same
difficulty
has
always
existed
and
will
always
continue
to
exist
whenever
emergencies
requiring
prompt
and
decisive
action
arise
or
conditions
obtain
that
must
be
handled
effectively
without
too
much
discussion
it
is
easy
while
sitting
on
the
piazza
with
your
cigar
to
recognize
the
rights
of
your
you
may
assert
most
vigorously
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
immunity
from
arrest
without
legal
cause
but
if
you
saw
a
seedy
character
sneaking
down
a
side
street
at
three
in
the
morning
his
pockets
bulging
with
jewelry
and
silver
would
you
have
the
policeman
on
post
insist
on
the
fact
that
a
burglary
had
been
committed
being
established
beyond
peradventure
before
arresting
the
suspect
who
in
the
meantime
would
undoubtedly
escape
of
course
the
worthy
officer
sometimes
does
this
but
his
conduct
in
that
case
becomes
the
subject
of
an
investigation
on
the
part
of
his
superiors
in
fact
the
rules
of
the
new
york
police
department
require
him
to
arrest
all
persons
carrying
bags
in
the
small
hours
who
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
themselves
yet
there
is
no
such
thing
under
the
laws
of
the
state
as
a
right
to
arrest
on
suspicion
no
citizen
may
be
arrested
under
the
statutes
unless
a
crime
has
actually
been
committed
thus
the
police
regulations
deliberately
compel
every
officer
either
to
violate
the
law
or
to
be
made
the
subject
of
charges
for
dereliction
of
duty
a
confusing
state
of
things
truly
to
a
man
who
wants
to
do
his
duty
by
himself
and
by
his
the
present
author
once
wrote
a
book
dealing
with
the
practical
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
which
the
unlawfulness
of
arrest
on
mere
suspicion
was
discussed
at
length
and
given
a
prominent
place
but
when
the
time
came
for
publication
that
portion
of
it
was
omitted
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
certain
of
the
authorities
on
the
ground
that
as
such
arrests
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law
a
public
exposition
of
their
illegality
would
do
infinite
harm
now
as
it
seems
the
time
has
come
when
the
facts
for
one
reason
or
another
should
be
faced
the
difficulty
does
not
end
however
with
arrest
on
suspicion
the
third
degree
mugging
or
their
allied
abuses
it
really
goes
to
the
root
of
our
whole
theory
of
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
is
it
possible
that
on
final
analysis
we
may
find
that
our
enthusiastic
insistence
upon
certain
of
the
supposedly
fundamental
liberties
of
the
individual
has
led
us
into
a
condition
of
legal
hypocrisy
vastly
less
desirable
than
the
frank
attitude
of
our
continental
neighbors
toward
such
subjects
the
massachusetts
constitution
of
concludes
with
the
now
famous
words
to
the
end
that
this
may
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
that
is
the
essence
of
the
spirit
of
american
government
our
forefathers
had
arisen
and
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
england
and
her
intolerable
system
of
penal
government
in
which
an
accused
had
no
right
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
and
under
which
he
could
be
hung
for
stealing
a
sheep
liberty
liberty
or
death
that
was
the
note
ringing
in
the
minds
and
mouths
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
and
framers
of
the
constitution
that
is
the
popular
note
of
the
fourth
of
july
orator
and
of
the
memorial
day
address
this
liberty
was
to
be
guaranteed
by
laws
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
never
to
be
curtailed
or
violated
no
mere
man
was
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
tamper
with
it
the
individual
was
to
be
protected
at
all
costs
no
king
or
sheriff
or
judge
or
officer
was
to
lay
his
finger
on
a
free
man
save
at
his
peril
if
he
did
the
free
man
might
immediately
have
his
law
have
the
law
on
him
as
the
good
old
expression
was
for
no
king
or
sheriff
was
above
the
law
in
fact
we
were
so
energetic
in
providing
safeguards
for
the
individual
even
when
a
that
we
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
effectiveness
of
kings
or
sheriffs
or
what
we
had
substituted
for
them
and
so
it
is
what
candidate
for
office
what
orator
or
senator
what
demagogue
or
preacher
could
hold
his
audience
or
capture
a
vote
if
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
liberty
he
should
lift
up
his
voice
in
behalf
of
the
rights
of
the
majority
as
against
the
individual
accordingly
in
devising
our
laws
we
have
provided
in
every
possible
way
for
the
freedom
of
the
citizen
from
all
interference
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
no
one
may
be
stopped
interrogated
examined
or
arrested
unless
a
crime
has
been
committed
every
one
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
shown
to
be
guilty
by
the
verdict
of
a
jury
no
one
premises
may
be
entered
or
searched
without
a
warrant
which
the
law
renders
it
difficult
to
obtain
every
accused
has
the
right
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
like
any
other
witness
the
fact
that
he
has
been
held
for
a
crime
by
a
magistrate
and
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
places
him
at
not
the
slightest
disadvantage
so
far
as
defending
himself
against
the
charge
is
concerned
for
he
must
be
proven
guilty
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
these
illustrations
of
the
jealousy
of
the
law
for
the
rights
of
citizens
might
be
multiplied
to
no
inconsiderable
extent
further
our
law
allows
a
defendant
convicted
of
crime
to
appeal
to
the
highest
courts
whereas
if
he
be
acquitted
the
people
or
state
of
new
york
have
no
right
of
appeal
at
all
without
dwelling
further
on
the
matter
it
is
enough
to
say
that
in
general
the
state
constitutions
their
general
laws
or
penal
statutes
provide
that
a
person
who
is
accused
or
suspected
of
crime
must
be
presumed
innocent
and
treated
accordingly
until
his
guilt
has
been
affirmatively
established
in
a
jury
trial
that
meantime
he
must
not
be
confined
or
detained
unless
a
crime
has
in
fact
been
committed
and
there
is
at
least
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
committed
it
and
further
that
if
arrested
he
must
be
given
an
immediate
opportunity
to
secure
bail
to
have
the
advice
of
counsel
and
must
in
no
way
be
compelled
to
give
any
evidence
against
himself
so
much
for
the
law
it
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
it
is
printed
in
the
books
in
words
of
one
syllable
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
we
have
done
our
best
to
perpetuate
the
theories
of
those
who
fearing
that
they
might
be
arrested
without
a
hearing
transported
for
trial
and
convicted
in
a
king
court
before
a
king
judge
for
a
crime
they
knew
nothing
of
insisted
on
liberty
or
death
they
had
had
enough
of
kings
and
their
ways
hereafter
they
were
to
have
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
but
the
unfortunate
fact
remains
that
all
laws
however
perfect
must
in
the
end
be
administered
by
imperfect
men
there
is
alas
no
such
thing
as
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
you
may
have
a
government
more
of
laws
and
less
of
men
or
vice
versa
but
you
can
not
have
an
of
the
golden
rule
sooner
or
later
you
come
to
a
man
in
the
white
house
or
on
a
wool
sack
or
at
a
desk
in
an
office
or
in
a
blue
coat
and
brass
buttons
and
then
to
a
very
considerable
extent
the
question
of
how
far
ours
is
to
be
a
government
of
laws
or
of
men
depends
upon
him
generally
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
it
is
going
to
be
of
man
for
every
official
finds
that
the
letter
of
the
law
works
an
injustice
many
times
out
of
a
hundred
if
he
is
worth
his
salary
he
will
try
to
temper
justice
with
mercy
if
he
is
human
he
will
endeavor
to
accomplish
justice
as
he
sees
it
so
long
as
the
law
can
be
stretched
to
accommodate
the
case
thus
inevitably
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
law
and
its
application
it
is
the
human
element
in
the
administration
of
the
law
that
enables
lawyers
to
get
a
living
it
is
usually
not
difficult
to
tell
what
the
law
is
the
puzzle
is
how
it
is
going
to
be
applied
in
any
individual
case
how
it
is
going
to
be
applied
depends
very
largely
upon
the
practical
side
of
the
matter
and
the
exigencies
of
existing
conditions
it
is
pretty
hard
to
apply
inflexibly
laws
over
a
hundred
years
old
it
is
equally
hard
to
police
a
city
of
a
million
or
so
polyglot
inhabitants
with
a
due
regard
to
their
theoretic
constitutional
rights
but
suppose
in
addition
that
these
theoretic
rights
are
entirely
theoretic
and
fly
in
the
face
of
the
laws
of
nature
experience
and
common
sense
what
then
what
is
a
police
commissioner
to
do
who
has
either
got
to
make
an
illegal
arrest
or
let
a
crook
get
away
who
must
violate
the
rights
of
men
illegally
detained
by
outrageously
mugging
them
or
egregiously
fail
to
have
a
record
of
the
professional
criminals
in
his
bailiwick
he
does
just
what
all
of
us
do
under
similar
conditions
he
takes
a
chance
but
in
the
case
of
the
police
the
thing
is
so
necessary
that
there
ceases
practically
to
be
any
chance
about
it
they
have
got
to
prevent
crime
and
arrest
criminals
if
they
fail
they
are
out
of
a
job
and
others
more
capable
or
less
scrupulous
take
their
places
the
fundamental
law
qualifying
all
systems
is
that
of
necessity
you
let
professional
crooks
carry
off
a
voter
silverware
simply
because
the
voter
being
asleep
is
unable
instantly
to
demonstrate
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
his
silver
has
been
stolen
you
ca
permit
burglars
to
drag
sacks
of
loot
through
the
streets
of
the
city
at
simply
because
they
are
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
proven
guilty
and
if
arrest
on
suspicion
were
not
permitted
demanded
by
the
public
and
required
by
the
police
ordinances
away
would
go
the
crooks
and
off
would
go
the
silverware
the
town
would
be
full
of
leather
snatchers
and
men
respectable
citizens
would
be
afraid
to
go
out
nights
and
liberty
would
degenerate
into
license
that
is
the
point
we
americans
or
at
least
some
of
the
newer
ones
of
us
have
an
idea
that
liberty
means
the
right
to
steal
apples
from
our
neighbor
orchard
without
interference
now
somewhere
or
other
there
has
got
to
be
a
switch
and
a
strong
arm
to
keep
us
in
order
and
the
switch
and
arm
must
not
wait
until
the
apples
are
stolen
and
eaten
before
getting
busy
if
we
come
climbing
over
the
fence
sweating
apples
at
every
pore
is
farmer
jones
to
go
and
count
his
apples
before
grabbing
us
the
most
presumptuous
of
all
presumptions
is
this
presumption
of
innocence
it
really
does
exist
save
in
the
mouths
of
judges
and
in
the
pages
of
the
law
books
yet
as
much
is
made
about
it
as
if
it
were
a
living
legal
principle
every
judge
in
a
criminal
case
is
required
to
charge
the
jury
in
form
or
substance
somewhat
as
follows
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
that
presumption
is
removed
by
competent
evidence
this
presumption
is
his
property
remaining
with
him
throughout
the
trial
and
until
rebutted
by
the
verdict
of
the
the
jury
has
no
right
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
defendant
stands
at
the
bar
accused
of
a
crime
by
an
indictment
found
by
the
grand
jury
shades
of
sir
henry
hawkins
does
the
judge
expect
that
they
are
actually
to
swallow
that
here
is
a
jury
sworn
to
a
true
verdict
find
in
the
case
of
an
ugly
looking
customer
at
the
bar
who
is
charged
with
knocking
down
an
old
man
and
stealing
his
watch
the
old
man
an
apostolic
looking
octogenarian
is
sitting
right
over
there
where
the
jury
can
see
him
one
look
at
the
plaintiff
and
one
at
the
accused
and
the
jury
may
be
heard
to
mutter
he
guilty
all
right
presumed
to
be
innocent
why
may
i
ask
do
not
the
jury
and
everybody
else
know
that
this
good
old
man
would
never
save
by
mistake
accuse
anybody
falsely
of
crime
innocence
why
the
natural
and
inevitable
presumption
is
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
the
human
mind
works
intuitively
by
comparison
and
experience
we
assume
or
presume
with
considerable
confidence
that
parents
love
their
children
that
all
college
presidents
are
great
and
good
men
and
that
wild
bulls
are
dangerous
animals
we
may
be
wrong
but
it
is
up
to
the
other
fellow
to
show
us
the
contrary
now
if
out
of
a
clear
sky
jones
accuses
robinson
of
being
a
thief
we
know
by
experience
that
the
chances
are
largely
in
favor
of
accusation
being
well
founded
people
as
a
rule
do
go
rushing
around
charging
each
other
with
being
crooks
unless
they
have
some
reason
for
it
thus
at
the
very
beginning
the
law
flies
in
the
face
of
probabilities
when
it
tells
us
that
a
man
accused
of
crime
must
be
presumed
to
be
innocent
in
point
of
fact
whatever
presumption
there
is
and
this
varies
with
the
circumstances
is
all
the
other
way
greater
or
less
depending
upon
the
particular
attitude
of
mind
and
experience
of
the
individual
this
natural
presumption
of
guilt
from
the
mere
fact
of
the
charge
is
rendered
all
the
more
likely
by
reason
of
the
uncharitable
readiness
with
which
we
believe
evil
of
our
fellows
how
unctuously
we
repeat
some
hearsay
bit
of
scandal
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
report
that
deacon
smith
has
stolen
the
church
funds
we
say
to
our
friends
with
a
sententious
sigh
the
outward
sign
of
an
invisible
satisfaction
deacon
smith
after
the
ha
ha
of
course
he
guilty
these
deacons
are
always
guilty
and
in
a
few
minutes
deacon
smith
is
ruined
forever
although
the
fact
of
the
matter
may
well
have
been
that
he
was
but
counting
the
money
in
the
this
willingness
to
believe
the
worst
of
others
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
of
historical
and
literary
record
the
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
it
might
well
have
been
put
the
evil
men
are
said
to
have
done
lives
forever
however
unfair
this
is
a
psychologic
condition
which
plays
an
important
part
in
rendering
the
presumption
of
innocence
a
gross
absurdity
but
let
us
press
the
history
of
jones
and
robinson
a
step
further
the
next
event
in
the
latter
criminal
history
is
his
appearance
in
court
before
a
magistrate
jones
produces
his
evidence
and
calls
his
witnesses
robinson
through
his
learned
counsel
them
and
then
summons
his
own
witnesses
to
prove
his
innocence
the
proceeding
may
take
several
days
or
perhaps
weeks
briefs
are
submitted
the
magistrate
considers
the
testimony
and
finally
decides
that
he
believes
robinson
guilty
and
must
hold
him
for
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
you
might
now
it
would
perhaps
seem
have
some
reason
for
suspecting
that
robinson
was
not
all
that
he
should
be
but
no
he
is
still
presumed
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
theoretically
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellows
to
be
as
innocent
as
a
babe
unborn
and
now
the
grand
jury
take
up
and
sift
the
evidence
that
has
already
been
gone
over
by
the
police
judge
they
too
call
witnesses
and
take
additional
testimony
they
likewise
are
convinced
of
robinson
guilt
and
straightway
hand
down
an
indictment
accusing
him
of
the
crime
a
bench
warrant
issues
the
defendant
is
run
to
earth
and
ignominiously
haled
to
court
but
he
is
still
presumed
to
be
innocent
does
not
the
law
say
so
and
is
not
this
a
government
of
laws
finally
the
district
attorney
who
is
not
looking
for
any
more
work
than
is
absolutely
necessary
investigates
the
case
decides
that
it
must
be
tried
and
begins
to
prepare
it
for
trial
as
the
facts
develop
themselves
robinson
guilt
becomes
more
and
more
clear
the
unfortunate
defendant
is
given
any
opportunity
he
may
desire
to
explain
away
the
charge
but
to
no
purpose
the
district
attorney
knows
robinson
is
guilty
and
so
does
everybody
else
including
robinson
at
last
this
presumably
innocent
man
is
brought
to
the
bar
for
trial
the
jury
scan
his
countenance
upon
which
guilt
is
plainly
written
they
contrast
his
appearance
with
that
of
the
honest
jones
they
know
he
has
been
accused
held
by
a
magistrate
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
and
that
his
case
after
careful
scrutiny
has
been
pressed
for
trial
by
the
public
prosecutor
do
they
really
presume
him
innocent
of
course
not
they
presume
him
guilty
so
soon
as
i
see
him
come
through
dot
leetle
door
in
the
back
of
the
room
then
i
know
he
guilty
as
the
foreman
said
in
the
old
story
what
good
does
the
presumption
of
innocence
so
called
do
for
the
miserable
robinson
none
whatever
save
perhaps
to
console
him
in
the
long
days
pending
his
trial
but
such
a
legal
hypocrisy
could
never
have
deceived
anybody
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
cast
aside
all
such
cant
and
frankly
admit
that
the
attitude
of
the
continental
law
toward
the
man
under
arrest
is
founded
upon
common
sense
and
the
experience
of
mankind
if
he
is
the
wrong
man
it
should
not
be
difficult
for
him
to
demonstrate
the
fact
at
any
rate
circumstances
are
against
him
and
he
should
be
anxious
to
explain
them
away
if
he
can
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
dealing
with
practical
conditions
police
methods
differ
very
little
in
different
countries
the
authorities
may
perhaps
keep
considerably
more
detailed
tabs
on
people
in
europe
than
in
the
united
states
but
if
they
are
once
caught
in
a
compromising
position
they
experience
about
the
same
treatment
wherever
they
happen
to
be
in
france
and
how
the
apostles
of
liberty
condemn
the
iniquity
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
that
country
the
suspect
or
undesirable
receives
a
polite
official
call
or
note
in
which
he
is
invited
to
leave
the
locality
as
soon
as
convenient
in
new
york
he
is
arrested
by
a
plainclothes
man
yanked
down
to
mulberry
street
for
the
night
and
next
afternoon
is
thrust
down
the
gangplank
of
a
just
departing
fall
river
liner
many
an
inspector
has
earned
unstinted
praise
even
from
the
new
york
evening
post
by
clearing
new
york
of
crooks
or
having
a
sort
of
of
suspicious
characters
whom
after
proper
identification
he
has
ejected
from
the
city
by
the
shortest
and
quickest
possible
route
yet
in
the
case
of
every
person
thus
arrested
and
driven
out
of
the
town
he
has
undoubtedly
violated
constitutional
rights
and
taken
the
law
into
his
own
hands
what
redress
can
a
penniless
tramp
secure
against
a
stout
inspector
of
police
able
and
willing
to
spend
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
his
own
defence
and
with
the
entire
force
ready
and
eager
to
get
at
the
tramp
and
put
him
out
of
business
he
swallows
his
pride
if
he
has
any
and
ruefully
slinks
out
of
town
for
a
period
of
enforced
abstinence
from
the
joys
of
metropolitan
existence
yet
who
shall
say
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
theoretic
outrage
upon
liberty
this
cleaning
out
of
the
city
is
not
highly
desirable
one
or
two
comparatively
innocent
men
may
be
caught
in
the
ruck
but
they
generally
manage
to
intimate
to
the
police
that
the
latter
have
got
them
wrong
and
duly
make
their
escape
the
others
resume
their
tramp
from
city
to
city
clothed
in
the
presumption
of
their
innocence
since
the
days
of
the
doges
or
of
the
spanish
inquisition
there
has
never
been
anything
like
the
morning
inspection
or
line
up
of
arrested
suspects
at
the
new
york
police
abolished
one
by
one
the
unfortunate
persons
arrested
during
the
previous
night
although
not
charged
with
any
crime
are
pointed
out
to
the
assembled
detective
force
who
scan
them
from
beneath
black
velvet
masks
in
order
that
they
themselves
may
not
be
recognized
when
they
meet
again
on
broadway
or
the
darker
side
streets
of
the
city
each
prisoner
is
described
and
his
character
and
past
performances
are
rehearsed
by
the
inspector
or
head
of
the
bureau
he
is
then
measured
mugged
and
if
lucky
turned
loose
what
does
his
liberty
amount
to
or
his
legal
rights
if
the
city
is
to
be
made
safe
yet
why
does
not
some
apostle
of
liberty
raise
his
voice
and
cry
aloud
concerning
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
are
not
the
rights
of
a
beggar
as
sacred
as
those
of
a
bishop
one
of
the
most
sacred
rights
guaranteed
under
the
law
is
that
of
not
being
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
ourselves
or
to
testify
to
anything
which
might
degrade
or
incriminate
us
now
this
is
all
very
fine
for
the
chap
who
has
his
lawyer
at
his
elbow
or
has
had
some
similar
previous
experience
he
may
wisely
shut
up
like
a
clam
and
set
at
defiance
the
tortures
of
the
third
degree
but
how
about
the
poor
fellow
arrested
on
suspicion
of
having
committed
a
murder
who
has
never
heard
of
the
legal
provision
in
question
or
if
he
has
is
cajoled
or
threatened
into
answering
one
or
two
questions
few
police
officers
take
the
trouble
to
warn
those
whom
they
arrest
that
what
they
say
may
be
used
against
them
what
is
the
use
of
course
when
they
testify
later
at
the
trial
they
inevitably
begin
their
testimony
with
the
stereotyped
phrase
i
first
warned
the
defendant
that
anything
which
he
said
might
be
used
against
him
if
they
did
warn
him
they
probably
whispered
it
or
mumbled
it
so
that
he
did
hear
what
they
said
or
in
any
event
whether
they
said
it
or
not
half
a
dozen
of
them
probably
took
him
into
a
back
room
and
having
set
him
with
his
back
against
the
wall
threatened
and
swore
at
him
until
he
told
them
what
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
and
perhaps
confessed
his
crime
when
the
case
comes
to
trial
the
police
give
the
impression
that
the
accused
quietly
summoned
them
to
his
cell
to
make
a
voluntary
statement
the
defendant
denies
this
of
course
but
the
evidence
goes
in
and
the
harm
has
been
done
no
doubt
the
methods
of
the
inquisition
are
in
vogue
the
world
over
under
similar
conditions
everybody
knows
that
a
statement
by
the
accused
immediately
upon
his
arrest
is
usually
the
most
important
evidence
that
can
be
secured
in
any
case
it
is
a
police
officer
duty
to
secure
one
if
he
can
do
so
by
legitimate
means
it
is
his
custom
to
secure
one
by
any
means
in
his
power
as
his
oath
that
such
a
statement
was
voluntary
makes
it
ipso
facto
admissible
as
evidence
the
statutes
providing
that
a
defendant
can
not
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself
are
practically
nullified
in
the
more
important
cases
the
accused
is
usually
put
through
some
sort
of
an
inquisitorial
process
by
the
captain
at
the
if
he
is
not
very
successful
at
getting
anything
out
of
the
prisoner
the
latter
is
turned
over
to
the
sergeant
and
a
couple
of
officers
who
can
use
methods
of
a
more
urgent
character
if
the
prisoner
is
arrested
by
headquarters
detectives
various
efficient
devices
to
compel
him
to
give
up
what
he
knows
may
be
used
such
as
depriving
him
of
food
and
sleep
placing
him
in
a
cell
with
a
stool
pigeon
who
will
try
to
worm
a
confession
out
of
him
and
the
usual
moral
suasion
of
a
talk
in
the
back
room
with
the
inspector
this
is
the
darker
side
of
the
picture
of
practical
government
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
police
do
not
always
suggest
the
various
safeguards
and
privileges
which
the
law
accords
to
defendants
thus
arrested
but
the
writer
is
free
to
confess
that
save
in
exceptional
cases
he
believes
the
rigors
of
the
third
degree
to
be
greatly
exaggerated
frequently
in
dealing
with
rough
men
rough
methods
are
used
but
considering
the
multitude
of
offenders
and
the
thousands
of
police
officers
none
of
whom
have
been
trained
in
a
school
of
gentleness
it
is
surprising
that
severer
treatment
is
not
generally
met
with
on
the
part
of
those
who
run
afoul
of
the
criminal
law
the
ordinary
cop
tries
to
do
his
duty
as
effectively
as
he
can
with
the
average
citizen
gruffness
and
roughness
go
a
long
way
in
the
assertion
of
authority
in
the
task
of
policing
a
big
city
the
rights
of
the
individual
must
indubitably
suffer
to
a
certain
extent
if
the
rights
of
the
multitude
are
to
be
properly
protected
we
can
make
too
much
of
small
injustices
and
petty
incivilities
police
business
is
not
gentle
business
the
officers
are
trying
to
prevent
you
and
me
from
being
knocked
on
the
head
some
dark
night
or
from
being
chloroformed
in
our
beds
ten
thousand
men
are
trying
to
do
a
job
the
struggle
to
keep
the
peace
and
put
down
crime
is
a
hard
one
anywhere
it
requires
a
strong
arm
that
can
not
show
too
punctilious
a
regard
for
theoretical
rights
when
prompt
decisions
have
to
be
made
and
equally
prompt
action
taken
the
thieves
and
gun
men
have
got
to
be
driven
out
suspicious
characters
have
got
to
be
locked
up
somehow
or
other
a
record
must
be
kept
of
professional
criminals
and
persons
likely
to
be
active
in
these
are
necessities
in
every
civilized
country
they
are
necessities
here
society
employs
the
same
methods
of
the
world
over
no
one
presumes
a
person
charged
with
crime
to
be
innocent
either
in
delhi
pekin
moscow
or
new
york
under
proper
circumstances
we
believe
him
guilty
when
he
comes
to
be
tried
the
jury
consider
the
evidence
and
if
they
are
reasonably
sure
he
is
guilty
they
convict
him
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
doubt
is
almost
as
much
of
a
fiction
as
that
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
from
the
time
a
man
is
arrested
until
arraignment
he
is
quizzed
with
a
view
to
inducing
him
to
admit
his
offence
or
give
some
evidence
that
may
help
convict
him
logically
why
should
not
a
person
charged
with
a
crime
be
obliged
to
give
what
explanation
he
can
of
the
affair
why
should
he
have
the
privilege
of
silence
does
he
owe
a
duty
to
the
public
the
same
as
any
other
witness
if
he
is
innocent
he
has
nothing
to
fear
if
he
is
guilty
away
with
him
the
french
have
no
false
ideas
about
such
things
and
at
the
same
time
they
have
a
high
regard
for
liberty
we
merely
cheat
ourselves
into
thinking
that
our
liberty
is
something
different
from
french
liberty
because
we
have
a
lot
of
laws
upon
our
statute
books
that
are
there
only
to
be
disregarded
and
would
have
to
be
repealed
instantly
if
enforced
take
for
instance
the
celebrated
provision
of
the
penal
laws
that
the
failure
of
an
accused
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
shall
not
be
taken
against
him
such
a
doctrine
flies
in
the
face
of
human
nature
if
a
man
sits
silent
when
witnesses
under
oath
accuse
him
of
a
crime
it
is
an
inevitable
inference
that
he
has
nothing
to
say
that
no
explanation
of
his
would
explain
the
records
show
that
the
vast
majority
of
accused
persons
who
do
not
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
testify
are
convicted
thus
the
law
which
permits
a
defendant
to
testify
in
reality
compels
him
to
testify
and
a
safeguard
of
liberty
turns
out
to
be
a
privilege
in
name
only
in
france
or
america
alike
a
man
accused
of
crime
sooner
or
later
has
to
tell
what
he
knows
or
take
his
medicine
it
makes
little
difference
whether
he
does
so
under
the
legalized
interrogation
of
a
juge
in
paris
or
under
the
examination
of
an
assistant
district
attorney
or
police
inspector
in
new
york
it
is
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
if
at
his
trial
in
france
he
remains
mute
under
examination
or
in
america
refrains
from
availing
himself
of
the
privilege
of
testifying
in
his
own
behalf
thus
we
are
reluctantly
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
all
human
institutions
have
their
limitations
and
that
however
theoretically
perfect
a
government
of
laws
may
be
it
must
be
administered
by
men
whose
chief
regard
will
not
be
the
idealization
of
a
theory
of
liberty
so
much
as
an
immediate
solution
of
some
concrete
problem
not
that
the
matter
after
all
is
particularly
important
to
most
of
us
but
laws
which
exist
only
to
be
broken
create
a
disrespect
and
disregard
for
law
which
may
ultimately
be
dangerous
it
would
be
perfectly
simple
for
the
legislature
to
say
that
a
citizen
might
be
arrested
under
circumstances
tending
to
create
a
reasonable
suspicion
even
if
he
had
not
committed
a
crime
and
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
pass
a
statute
providing
that
the
commissioner
of
police
might
mug
and
measure
all
criminals
immediately
after
conviction
as
it
is
the
prison
authorities
wo
let
him
so
he
has
to
do
it
while
he
has
the
opportunity
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
is
rather
hard
on
the
innocent
but
they
now
have
to
suffer
with
the
guilty
for
the
sins
of
an
indolent
and
uninterested
legislature
moreover
if
such
a
right
of
arrest
were
proposed
some
wiseacre
or
politician
would
probably
rise
up
and
denounce
the
suggestion
as
the
first
step
in
the
direction
of
a
military
dictatorship
thus
we
shall
undoubtedly
fare
happily
on
in
the
blissful
belief
that
our
personal
liberties
are
the
subject
of
the
most
solicitous
and
zealous
care
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
guaranteed
to
us
under
a
government
which
is
not
of
men
but
of
laws
until
one
of
us
happens
to
be
arrested
by
mistake
of
course
and
learns
by
sad
experience
the
practical
methods
of
the
police
in
dealing
with
criminals
and
the
agreeable
but
deceptive
character
of
the
pleasant
fiction
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
chapter
ii
preparing
a
criminal
case
for
trial
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
a
great
criminal
trial
arises
to
open
the
case
to
the
impanelled
jury
very
few
if
any
of
them
have
the
slightest
conception
of
the
enormous
expenditure
of
time
thought
and
labor
which
has
gone
into
the
preparation
of
the
case
and
made
possible
his
brief
and
easily
delivered
speech
for
in
this
opening
address
of
his
there
must
be
no
flaw
since
a
single
misstated
or
overstated
fact
may
prejudice
the
jury
against
him
and
result
in
his
defeat
upon
it
also
depends
the
jury
first
impression
of
the
case
and
of
the
prosecutor
himself
no
inconsiderable
factor
in
the
result
in
a
trial
of
importance
its
careful
construction
with
due
regard
to
what
facts
shall
be
omitted
in
order
to
enhance
their
dramatic
effect
when
ultimately
proven
may
well
occupy
the
district
attorney
every
evening
for
a
week
but
if
the
speech
itself
has
involved
study
and
travail
it
is
as
nothing
compared
with
the
amount
required
by
that
most
important
feature
of
every
criminal
case
the
selection
of
the
jury
for
a
month
before
the
trial
or
whenever
it
may
be
that
the
jury
has
been
drawn
every
member
upon
the
panel
has
been
subjected
to
an
unseen
scrutiny
the
prosecutor
through
his
own
or
through
hired
sleuths
has
examined
into
the
family
history
the
business
standing
and
methods
the
financial
responsibility
the
political
and
social
affiliations
and
the
personal
habits
and
past
performances
of
each
and
every
talesman
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
they
one
by
one
take
the
on
what
is
called
the
voir
dire
to
subject
themselves
to
an
examination
by
both
sides
as
to
their
fitness
to
serve
as
jurors
in
the
case
the
district
attorney
probably
has
close
fit
hand
a
rather
detailed
account
of
each
and
perchance
has
great
difficulty
in
restraining
a
smile
when
some
prospective
juror
in
his
eagerness
either
to
serve
or
to
escape
deliberately
equivocates
in
answer
to
an
important
question
as
to
his
personal
history
are
you
acquainted
with
the
accused
or
his
family
mildly
inquires
the
assistant
prosecutor
no
not
at
all
the
talesman
may
blandly
reply
the
answer
perhaps
is
literally
true
and
yet
the
prosecutor
may
be
pardoned
for
murmuring
liar
to
himself
as
he
sees
that
his
memorandum
concerning
the
qualifications
states
that
he
belongs
to
the
same
lodge
with
the
prisoner
uncle
by
marriage
and
carries
an
open
account
on
his
books
with
the
defendant
father
i
think
we
will
excuse
ananias
politely
remarks
the
prosecutor
then
in
an
undertone
he
turns
to
his
chief
and
mutters
the
old
rascal
he
would
have
knifed
us
if
we
given
him
the
chance
and
all
this
time
the
disgruntled
ananias
is
wondering
why
if
he
did
know
the
defendant
or
his
family
he
was
not
accepted
as
a
juror
of
course
every
district
attorney
has
or
should
have
information
as
to
each
talesman
actual
capabilities
as
a
juror
and
something
of
a
record
as
to
how
he
has
acted
under
fire
if
he
is
a
member
of
the
special
panel
it
is
easy
to
find
out
whether
he
has
ever
acquitted
or
convicted
in
any
cause
celebre
and
if
he
has
acquitted
any
plainly
guilty
defendant
in
the
past
it
is
not
likely
that
his
services
will
be
required
if
however
he
has
convicted
in
such
a
case
the
district
attorney
may
try
to
lure
the
other
side
into
accepting
him
by
making
it
appear
that
he
himself
is
doubtful
as
to
the
juror
desirability
sometimes
persons
accused
of
crime
themselves
and
actually
under
indictment
find
their
way
onto
the
panels
and
more
than
one
has
appeared
there
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
but
to
find
them
out
may
well
require
a
double
shift
of
men
working
day
and
night
for
a
month
before
the
case
is
called
and
what
may
appear
to
be
the
most
trivial
fact
thus
discovered
may
in
the
end
prove
the
decisive
argument
for
or
against
accepting
the
juror
panel
after
panel
may
be
exhausted
before
a
jury
in
a
great
murder
trial
has
been
selected
for
each
side
in
addition
to
its
challenges
for
cause
or
bias
has
peremptory
ones
which
it
may
exercise
arbitrarily
if
the
writer
recollection
is
not
at
fault
the
large
original
panel
drawn
in
the
first
molineux
trial
was
used
up
and
several
others
had
to
be
drawn
until
eight
hundred
talesmen
had
been
interrogated
before
the
jury
was
finally
selected
it
is
usual
to
examine
at
least
fifty
in
the
ordinary
murder
case
before
a
jury
is
secured
in
the
state
of
new
york
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
that
this
scrutiny
of
talesmen
is
not
strictly
preparation
for
the
trial
but
in
fact
it
is
fully
as
important
as
getting
ready
the
facts
themselves
for
a
poor
jury
either
from
ignorance
or
prejudice
will
acquit
on
the
same
facts
which
will
lead
a
sound
jury
to
convict
a
famous
prosecutor
used
to
say
get
your
jury
the
case
will
take
care
of
itself
but
as
the
examination
of
the
panel
and
the
opening
address
come
last
in
point
of
chronology
it
will
be
well
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
see
what
the
labors
of
the
prosecutor
are
in
the
initial
stages
of
preparation
let
us
take
for
example
some
notorious
case
where
an
unfortunate
victim
has
died
from
the
effects
of
a
poisoned
pill
or
draught
of
medicine
or
has
been
found
dead
in
his
room
with
a
revolver
bullet
in
his
heart
some
time
before
the
matter
has
come
into
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor
the
press
and
the
police
have
generally
been
doing
more
or
less
usually
less
effective
work
upon
the
case
the
yellow
journals
have
evolved
some
theory
of
who
is
the
culprit
and
have
loosed
their
respective
reporters
and
special
criminologists
upon
him
each
has
its
own
idea
and
its
own
methods
often
unscrupulous
and
each
has
its
own
particular
victim
upon
whom
it
intends
to
fasten
the
blame
heaven
save
his
reputation
many
an
innocent
man
has
been
ruined
for
life
through
the
efforts
of
a
newspaper
to
make
a
case
and
of
course
the
same
thing
though
happily
in
a
lesser
degree
is
true
of
the
police
and
of
some
prosecutors
as
well
in
every
great
criminal
case
there
are
always
four
different
and
frequently
antagonistic
elements
engaged
in
the
work
of
detection
and
prosecution
first
the
police
second
the
district
attorney
third
the
press
and
lastly
the
personal
friends
and
family
of
the
deceased
or
injured
party
each
for
its
own
ends
be
it
professional
pride
personal
glorification
hard
cash
or
revenge
is
equally
anxious
to
find
the
evidence
and
establish
a
case
of
course
the
police
are
the
first
ones
notified
of
the
commission
of
a
crime
but
as
it
is
now
almost
universally
their
duty
to
inform
at
once
the
coroner
and
also
the
district
attorney
thereof
a
tripartite
race
for
glory
frequently
results
which
adds
nothing
to
the
dignity
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
the
coroner
is
at
best
no
more
than
an
appendix
to
the
legal
anatomy
and
frequently
he
is
a
disease
the
spectacle
of
a
medical
man
of
small
learning
and
less
english
trying
to
preside
over
a
court
of
first
instance
is
enough
to
make
the
accused
himself
chuckle
for
joy
not
long
ago
the
coroners
of
new
york
discovered
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
or
his
representatives
generally
arrived
first
at
the
scene
of
any
crime
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
medicos
to
do
for
the
district
attorney
would
thereupon
submit
the
matter
at
once
to
the
grand
jury
instead
of
going
through
the
formality
of
a
hearing
in
the
coroner
court
the
legal
medicine
men
felt
aggrieved
and
determined
to
be
such
early
birds
that
no
worm
should
escape
them
accordingly
the
next
time
one
of
them
was
notified
of
a
homicide
he
raced
his
horse
down
madison
avenue
at
such
speed
that
he
collided
with
a
trolley
car
and
broke
his
leg
another
complained
to
the
district
attorney
that
the
assistants
of
the
latter
who
had
arrived
at
the
scene
of
an
asphyxiation
before
him
had
bungled
everything
ach
dose
young
men
he
exclaimed
wringing
his
hands
dose
young
men
dey
come
here
and
dey
opened
der
vindow
and
let
out
der
gas
and
all
mine
evidence
esgaped
it
is
said
that
this
interesting
personage
once
instructed
his
jury
to
find
that
the
diseased
came
to
his
death
from
an
ulster
on
the
stomach
these
anecdotes
are
perhaps
what
judges
would
call
obiter
dicta
yet
the
coroner
court
has
more
than
once
been
utilized
as
a
field
in
the
actual
preparation
of
a
criminal
case
when
roland
molineux
was
first
suspected
of
having
caused
the
death
of
adams
by
sending
the
famous
poisoned
package
of
patent
medicine
to
harry
cornish
through
the
mails
the
assistant
district
attorney
summoned
him
as
a
witness
to
the
coroner
court
and
attempted
to
get
from
him
in
this
way
a
statement
which
molineux
would
otherwise
have
refused
to
make
when
all
the
first
hullabaloo
is
over
and
the
accused
is
under
arrest
and
safely
locked
up
it
is
usually
found
that
the
police
have
merely
run
down
the
obvious
witnesses
and
made
a
prima
facie
case
all
the
finer
work
remains
to
be
done
either
by
the
district
attorney
himself
or
by
the
detective
bureau
working
under
his
immediate
direction
or
in
harmony
with
him
little
order
has
been
observed
in
the
securing
of
evidence
every
one
is
a
fish
who
runs
into
the
net
of
the
police
and
all
is
grist
that
comes
to
their
mill
the
district
attorney
sends
for
the
officers
who
have
worked
upon
the
case
and
for
the
captain
or
inspector
who
has
directed
their
efforts
takes
all
the
papers
and
tabulates
all
their
information
his
practiced
eye
shows
him
at
once
that
a
large
part
is
valueless
much
is
contradictory
and
all
needs
careful
elaboration
a
winnowing
process
occurs
then
and
there
and
the
officers
probably
receive
a
special
detail
from
headquarters
and
thereafter
take
their
orders
from
the
prosecutor
himself
the
detective
bureau
is
called
in
and
arrangements
made
for
the
running
down
of
particular
clues
then
he
will
take
off
his
coat
clear
his
desk
and
get
down
to
work
of
course
his
first
step
is
to
get
all
the
information
he
can
as
to
the
actual
facts
surrounding
the
crime
itself
he
immediately
subpoenas
all
the
witnesses
whether
previously
interrogated
by
the
police
or
not
who
know
anything
about
the
matter
and
subjects
them
to
a
rigorous
then
he
sends
for
the
police
themselves
and
them
if
it
appears
that
any
witnesses
have
disappeared
he
instructs
his
detectives
how
and
where
to
look
for
them
often
this
becomes
in
the
end
the
most
important
element
in
the
preparation
for
the
trial
thus
in
the
nan
patterson
case
the
search
for
and
ultimate
discovery
of
and
morgan
smith
the
sister
and
of
the
accused
was
one
of
its
most
dramatic
features
after
they
had
been
found
it
was
necessary
to
indict
and
then
to
extradite
them
in
order
to
secure
their
presence
within
the
jurisdiction
and
when
all
this
had
been
accomplished
it
proved
practically
valueless
it
frequently
happens
that
an
entire
case
will
rest
upon
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness
whose
absence
from
the
jurisdiction
would
prevent
the
trial
an
instance
of
such
a
case
was
that
of
albert
patrick
for
without
the
testimony
of
his
alleged
accomplice
the
valet
jones
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
murder
the
preservation
of
such
a
witness
and
his
testimony
thus
becomes
of
paramount
importance
and
rascally
witnesses
sometimes
enjoy
considerable
ease
if
not
luxury
at
the
expense
of
the
public
while
waiting
to
testify
often
too
a
case
of
great
interest
will
arise
where
the
question
of
the
guilt
of
the
accused
turns
upon
the
evidence
of
some
one
person
who
either
from
mercenary
motives
or
because
of
blood
and
affection
is
unwilling
to
come
to
the
fore
and
tell
the
truth
a
striking
case
of
this
sort
occurred
some
ten
years
ago
the
black
sheep
of
a
prominent
new
york
family
forged
the
name
of
his
sister
to
a
draft
for
thirty
thousand
dollars
this
sister
who
was
an
elderly
woman
of
the
highest
character
and
refinement
did
not
care
to
pocket
the
loss
herself
and
declined
to
have
the
draft
debited
to
her
account
at
the
bank
a
lawsuit
followed
in
which
the
sister
swore
that
the
name
signed
to
the
draft
was
not
in
her
handwriting
she
won
her
case
but
some
officious
person
laid
the
matter
before
the
district
attorney
the
forger
was
arrested
and
his
sister
was
summoned
before
the
grand
jury
here
was
a
pleasant
predicament
if
she
testified
for
the
state
her
brother
would
undoubtedly
go
to
prison
for
many
years
to
say
nothing
of
the
notoriety
for
the
entire
family
which
so
sensational
a
case
would
occasion
she
therefore
slipped
out
of
the
city
and
sailed
for
europe
the
night
before
she
was
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
her
brother
was
in
due
course
indicted
and
held
for
trial
in
large
bail
but
there
was
and
is
no
prospect
of
convicting
him
for
his
crime
so
long
as
his
sister
remains
in
the
voluntary
exile
to
which
she
has
subjected
herself
she
can
never
return
to
new
york
to
live
unless
something
happens
either
to
the
indictment
or
her
brother
neither
of
which
events
seems
likely
in
the
immediate
future
perhaps
if
the
case
is
one
of
shooting
the
weapon
has
vanished
its
discovery
may
lead
to
the
finding
of
the
murderer
in
one
instance
where
a
body
was
found
in
the
woods
with
a
bullet
through
the
heart
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
who
had
committed
the
crime
the
only
scintilla
of
evidence
was
an
exploded
cartridge
a
small
thing
on
which
to
build
a
case
but
the
district
attorney
had
the
hammer
marks
upon
the
cap
magnified
several
hundred
times
and
then
set
out
to
find
the
rifle
which
bore
the
hammer
which
had
made
them
thousands
of
rifles
all
over
the
state
were
examined
at
last
in
a
remote
lumber
camp
was
found
the
weapon
which
had
fired
the
fatal
bullet
the
owner
was
arrested
accused
of
the
murder
and
confessed
his
crime
in
like
manner
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
determine
where
a
typewritten
document
was
prepared
the
letters
may
be
magnified
and
by
examining
the
ribbons
of
suspected
machines
the
desired
fact
may
be
ascertained
the
magnifying
glass
still
plays
an
important
part
in
detecting
crime
although
usually
in
ways
little
suspected
by
the
general
public
on
the
other
hand
where
the
weapon
has
not
been
spirited
away
the
detectives
may
spend
weeks
in
discovering
when
and
where
it
was
purchased
every
pawnshop
every
store
where
a
pistol
could
be
bought
is
investigated
and
under
proper
circumstances
the
requisite
evidence
to
show
deliberation
and
premeditation
may
be
secured
these
investigations
are
naturally
conducted
at
the
very
outset
of
the
preparation
of
the
case
the
weapon
in
seven
trials
out
of
ten
is
the
most
important
thing
in
it
by
its
means
it
can
generally
be
demonstrated
whether
the
shooting
was
accidental
or
intentional
and
whether
or
not
the
killing
was
in
where
this
last
plea
is
interposed
it
is
usually
made
at
once
upon
the
arrest
the
accused
explaining
to
the
police
that
he
fired
only
to
save
his
own
life
in
such
a
situation
where
the
killing
is
admitted
practically
the
entire
preparation
will
centre
upon
the
most
minute
tests
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
shot
was
fired
as
the
accused
claims
that
it
was
the
writer
can
recall
at
least
a
dozen
cases
in
his
own
experience
where
the
story
of
the
defendant
that
the
revolver
was
discharged
in
a
struggle
was
conclusively
disproved
by
experimenting
with
the
weapon
before
the
trial
there
was
one
homicide
in
which
a
bullet
perforated
a
felt
cap
and
penetrated
the
forehead
of
the
deceased
the
defendant
asserted
that
he
was
within
three
feet
of
his
victim
when
he
fired
and
that
the
other
was
about
to
strike
him
with
a
bludgeon
a
quantity
of
felt
of
weight
similar
to
that
of
the
cap
was
procured
and
the
revolver
discharged
at
it
from
varying
distances
a
microscopic
examination
showed
that
certain
discolorations
around
the
claimed
by
the
defence
to
be
burns
made
by
the
powder
were
in
fact
grease
marks
and
that
the
shot
must
have
been
fired
from
a
distance
of
about
fifteen
feet
the
defendant
was
convicted
on
his
own
story
supplemented
by
the
evidence
of
the
witness
who
made
the
tests
the
most
obvious
and
first
requirement
is
as
has
been
said
to
find
the
direct
witnesses
to
the
facts
surrounding
the
crime
commit
their
statements
under
oath
to
writing
so
that
they
can
not
later
be
denied
or
evaded
and
make
sure
that
these
witnesses
will
not
only
hold
no
intercourse
with
the
other
side
but
will
be
on
hand
when
wanted
this
last
is
not
always
an
easy
task
and
various
expedients
often
have
to
be
resorted
to
such
as
placing
hostile
witnesses
under
police
surveillance
or
in
some
cases
in
houses
of
detention
and
hiding
others
in
places
or
supplying
them
with
a
bodyguard
if
violence
is
to
be
anticipated
when
the
proper
time
comes
the
favorable
witnesses
must
be
duly
drilled
or
coached
which
does
not
imply
anything
improper
but
means
merely
that
they
must
be
instructed
how
to
deliver
their
testimony
what
answers
are
expected
to
certain
questions
and
what
facts
it
is
intended
to
elicit
from
them
witnesses
are
often
offended
and
run
amuck
because
they
are
not
given
a
chance
upon
the
stand
to
tell
the
story
of
their
lives
this
must
be
guarded
against
and
steps
taken
to
have
their
statements
given
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
audible
and
intelligible
a
few
lessons
in
elementary
elocution
are
generally
vitally
necessary
the
man
with
the
bassoon
voice
must
be
tamed
and
the
birdlike
old
lady
made
to
chirp
more
loudly
but
all
this
is
the
preparation
which
must
take
place
in
every
case
and
while
highly
important
is
of
far
less
interest
than
the
development
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
is
the
next
consideration
of
the
district
attorney
the
discovery
and
proper
proof
of
minute
facts
which
tend
to
demonstrate
the
guilt
of
an
accused
are
the
joy
of
the
natural
prosecutor
and
he
may
in
his
enthusiasm
spend
many
thousands
of
dollars
on
what
seems
and
often
is
an
immaterial
matter
youthful
officials
intrusted
with
the
preparation
of
important
cases
often
become
unduly
excited
and
forget
that
the
taxpayers
are
paying
the
bills
the
writer
remembers
sitting
beside
one
of
these
enthusiasts
during
a
celebrated
trial
a
certain
woman
witness
had
incidentally
testified
to
a
remote
meeting
with
the
deceased
at
which
a
certain
other
woman
was
alleged
to
have
been
present
the
matter
did
not
seem
of
much
interest
or
importance
but
the
youth
in
question
seized
a
yellow
pad
and
excitedly
wrote
in
blue
pencil
find
birdie
the
other
lady
at
any
cost
this
he
handed
to
a
detective
who
hastened
importantly
away
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
birdie
was
found
speedily
and
in
an
inexpensive
manner
when
the
case
against
albert
patrick
later
convicted
of
the
murder
of
the
aged
william
rice
was
in
course
of
preparation
it
was
found
desirable
to
show
that
patrick
had
called
up
his
accomplice
on
the
telephone
upon
the
night
of
the
murder
accordingly
the
telephone
company
was
compelled
to
examine
several
hundred
thousand
telephone
slips
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
had
actually
occurred
while
the
fact
was
established
in
the
affirmative
the
company
now
destroys
its
slips
in
order
not
to
have
to
repeat
the
performance
a
second
time
likewise
in
the
preparation
of
the
molineux
case
it
became
important
to
demonstrate
that
the
accused
had
sent
a
letter
under
an
assumed
name
ordering
certain
remedies
as
a
result
one
of
the
employees
of
the
company
spent
several
months
going
over
their
old
mail
orders
and
comparing
them
with
a
certain
sample
until
at
last
the
letter
was
unearthed
of
course
the
district
attorney
had
to
pay
for
it
and
it
was
probably
worth
what
it
cost
to
the
prosecution
although
molineux
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
was
acquitted
upon
his
second
trial
the
danger
is
however
that
a
prosecutor
who
has
an
unlimited
amount
of
money
at
his
disposal
may
be
led
into
expenditures
which
are
hardly
justified
simply
because
he
thinks
they
may
help
to
secure
a
conviction
nothing
is
easier
than
to
waste
money
in
this
fashion
and
public
officials
sometimes
spend
the
county
money
with
considerably
more
freedom
than
they
would
their
own
under
similar
circumstances
the
legitimate
expenses
connected
with
the
preparation
of
every
important
case
are
naturally
large
for
example
diagrams
must
be
prepared
photographs
taken
of
the
place
of
the
crime
witnesses
compensated
for
their
time
and
their
expenses
paid
and
most
important
of
all
competent
experts
must
be
engaged
this
leads
us
to
an
interesting
aspect
of
the
modern
jury
trial
when
no
other
defence
to
homicide
is
possible
the
claim
of
insanity
is
frequently
interposed
nothing
is
more
confusing
to
the
ordinary
juryman
than
trying
to
determine
the
probative
value
of
evidence
touching
unsoundness
of
mind
and
the
application
thereto
of
the
legal
test
of
criminal
responsibility
in
point
of
fact
juries
are
hardly
to
be
blamed
for
this
since
the
law
itself
is
antiquated
and
the
subject
one
abounding
in
difficulty
unfortunately
the
opportunity
for
vague
yet
damaging
testimony
on
the
part
of
experts
the
ease
with
which
any
desired
opinion
can
be
defended
by
a
slight
alteration
in
the
hypothetical
facts
and
the
practical
impossibility
of
exposure
have
been
seized
upon
with
avidity
by
a
score
or
more
of
unscrupulous
alienists
who
are
prepared
to
sell
their
services
to
the
highest
bidder
these
men
are
all
the
more
dangerous
because
clever
students
of
mental
disease
and
thorough
masters
of
their
subject
as
they
are
they
are
able
by
adroit
qualifications
and
skilful
evasions
to
make
seem
as
convincing
as
whole
ones
they
ask
and
receive
large
sums
for
their
services
and
their
dishonest
testimony
must
be
met
and
refuted
by
the
evidence
of
honest
physicians
who
by
virtue
of
their
attainments
have
a
right
to
demand
substantial
fees
even
so
newspaper
reports
of
the
expense
to
the
state
of
notorious
trials
are
grossly
exaggerated
the
entire
cost
of
the
first
thaw
trial
to
the
county
of
new
york
was
considerably
less
than
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
the
second
trial
not
more
than
half
that
amount
to
the
defence
however
it
was
a
costly
matter
as
the
recent
schedules
in
bankruptcy
of
the
defendant
show
therein
it
appears
that
one
of
his
counsel
still
claims
as
owing
to
him
for
his
services
on
the
first
trial
the
modest
sum
of
thousand
dollars
the
cost
of
the
whole
defence
was
probably
ten
times
that
sum
most
of
the
money
goes
to
the
lawyers
and
the
experts
take
the
remainder
it
goes
without
saying
that
both
prosecutor
and
attorney
for
the
defence
must
be
masters
of
the
subject
involved
a
trial
for
poisoning
means
an
exhaustive
study
not
only
of
analytic
chemistry
but
of
practical
medicine
on
the
part
of
all
the
lawyers
in
the
case
while
a
plea
of
insanity
requires
that
for
the
time
being
the
district
attorney
shall
become
an
alienist
familiar
with
every
aspect
of
paranoia
dementia
praecox
and
all
other
forms
of
mania
he
must
also
reduce
his
knowledge
to
concrete
workable
form
and
be
able
to
defeat
opposing
experts
on
their
own
ground
but
such
knowledge
comes
only
by
prayer
and
fasting
or
perhaps
rather
by
months
of
hard
and
remorseless
grind
the
writer
once
prosecuted
a
druggist
who
had
by
mistake
filled
a
prescription
for
a
pill
of
calomel
with
a
pill
of
morphine
the
baby
for
whom
the
pill
was
intended
died
in
consequence
the
defence
was
that
the
prescription
had
been
properly
filled
but
that
the
child
was
the
victim
of
various
diseases
from
acute
gastritis
to
meningitis
in
preparation
the
writer
was
compelled
to
spend
four
hours
every
evening
for
a
week
with
three
specialists
and
became
temporarily
a
minor
expert
on
children
diseases
he
is
forced
to
admit
that
he
would
not
know
a
case
of
acute
gastritis
from
one
of
mumps
but
the
druggist
was
convicted
yet
it
is
not
enough
to
prepare
for
the
defence
you
believe
the
accused
is
going
to
interpose
a
conscientious
preparation
means
getting
ready
for
any
defence
he
may
endeavor
to
put
in
just
as
the
prudent
general
has
an
eye
to
every
possible
turn
of
the
battle
and
has
if
he
can
on
the
march
so
the
prosecutor
must
be
ready
for
anything
and
readiest
of
all
for
the
unexpected
he
must
not
rest
upon
the
belief
that
the
other
side
will
concede
any
fact
however
clear
it
may
seem
some
cases
are
lost
simply
because
it
never
occurs
to
the
district
attorney
that
the
accused
will
deny
something
which
the
state
has
twenty
witnesses
to
prove
the
twenty
witnesses
are
therefore
not
summoned
on
the
day
of
trial
the
defendant
does
deny
it
and
as
it
is
a
case
of
word
against
word
the
accused
gets
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
perhaps
is
acquitted
no
case
is
properly
prepared
unless
there
is
in
the
every
witness
who
knows
anything
about
any
aspect
of
the
case
no
one
can
foretell
when
the
unimportant
will
become
the
vital
most
cases
turn
on
an
unconsidered
point
a
prosecutor
once
lost
what
seemed
to
him
the
clearest
sort
of
a
case
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
defendant
had
passed
out
of
the
courtroom
rejoicing
he
turned
to
the
foreman
and
asked
the
reason
for
the
verdict
did
you
hear
your
chief
witness
say
he
was
a
carpenter
inquired
the
foreman
why
certainly
answered
the
district
attorney
did
you
hear
me
ask
him
what
he
paid
for
that
pine
door
he
claimed
to
be
working
on
when
he
saw
the
assault
the
prosecutor
recalled
the
incident
and
nodded
well
he
said
ten
dollars
and
i
knew
he
was
a
liar
a
door
like
that
do
cost
but
it
is
perhaps
too
much
to
require
a
knowledge
of
carpentry
on
the
part
of
a
lawyer
trying
an
assault
case
yet
the
juror
was
undoubtedly
right
in
his
deduction
in
a
case
where
insanity
is
the
defence
the
state
must
dig
up
and
have
at
hand
every
person
it
can
find
who
knew
the
accused
at
any
period
of
his
career
he
will
probably
claim
that
in
his
youth
he
was
kicked
in
a
game
of
and
fractured
his
skull
that
later
he
fell
into
an
elevator
shaft
and
had
concussion
of
the
brain
or
that
he
was
hit
on
the
head
by
a
burglar
it
is
usually
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
disprove
such
assertions
but
the
prosecutor
must
be
ready
if
he
can
to
show
that
was
not
invented
until
after
the
defendant
had
attained
maturity
that
it
was
some
other
man
who
fell
down
the
elevator
shaft
and
to
produce
the
burglar
to
deny
that
the
assault
occurred
naturally
complete
preparation
for
an
important
trial
demands
the
presence
of
many
witnesses
who
ultimately
are
not
needed
and
who
are
never
called
probably
in
most
such
cases
about
half
the
witnesses
do
not
testify
at
all
most
of
what
has
been
said
relates
to
the
preparation
for
trial
of
cases
where
the
accused
is
already
under
arrest
when
the
district
attorney
is
called
into
the
case
if
this
stage
has
not
been
reached
the
prosecutor
may
well
be
called
upon
to
exercise
some
of
the
functions
of
a
detective
in
the
first
instance
a
few
years
ago
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
new
york
authorities
that
many
blackmailing
letters
were
being
received
bearing
the
name
of
lewis
jarvis
these
were
of
a
character
to
render
the
apprehension
of
the
writer
of
them
a
matter
of
much
importance
the
letters
directed
that
the
replies
be
sent
to
a
certain
box
in
the
new
york
but
as
the
boxes
are
numerous
and
close
together
it
seemed
doubtful
if
lewis
jarvis
could
be
detected
when
he
called
for
his
mail
the
district
attorney
the
police
and
the
officials
finally
evolved
the
scheme
of
plugging
the
lock
of
lewis
jarvis
box
with
a
match
the
scheme
worked
for
jarvis
finding
that
he
could
not
use
his
key
went
to
the
delivery
window
and
asked
for
his
mail
the
very
instant
the
letters
reached
his
hand
the
gyves
were
upon
the
wrists
of
one
of
the
attorneys
in
the
city
when
the
district
attorney
has
been
apprised
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
a
certain
person
is
the
guilty
party
he
not
infrequently
allows
the
suspect
to
go
his
way
under
the
careful
watch
of
detectives
and
thus
often
secures
much
new
evidence
against
him
in
this
way
it
is
sometimes
established
that
the
accused
has
endeavored
to
bribe
the
witnesses
and
to
induce
them
to
leave
the
state
while
the
whereabouts
of
stolen
loot
is
often
discovered
in
most
instances
however
the
district
attorney
begins
where
the
police
leave
off
and
he
merely
supplements
their
labors
and
prepares
for
the
actual
trial
itself
but
the
press
he
has
always
with
him
and
from
the
first
moment
after
the
crime
up
to
the
execution
of
the
sentence
or
the
liberation
of
the
accused
the
reporters
dog
his
footsteps
sit
on
his
doorstep
and
deluge
him
with
advice
and
information
now
a
curious
feature
about
the
evidence
worked
up
by
reporters
for
their
papers
is
that
little
of
it
materializes
when
the
prosecutor
wishes
to
make
use
of
it
of
course
some
reporters
do
excellent
detective
work
and
there
are
one
or
two
veterans
attached
to
the
criminal
courts
in
new
york
city
who
in
addition
to
their
literary
capacities
are
sleuths
and
combine
with
a
knowledge
of
criminal
law
almost
as
extensive
as
that
of
a
regular
prosecutor
a
resourcefulness
and
nerve
that
often
win
the
case
for
whichever
side
they
espouse
i
have
frequently
found
that
these
men
knew
more
about
the
cases
which
i
was
prosecuting
than
i
did
myself
and
a
tip
from
them
has
more
than
once
turned
defeat
into
victory
but
newspaper
men
for
one
reason
or
another
are
loath
to
testify
and
usually
make
but
poor
witnesses
they
feel
that
their
motives
will
be
questioned
and
are
naturally
unwilling
to
put
themselves
in
an
equivocal
position
the
writer
well
remembers
that
in
the
mabel
parker
case
where
the
defendant
a
young
and
pretty
woman
had
boasted
of
her
forgeries
before
a
roomful
of
reporters
it
was
impossible
when
her
trial
was
called
to
find
more
than
one
of
them
who
would
testify
and
he
had
practically
to
be
dragged
to
the
witness
chair
in
point
of
fact
if
reporters
made
a
practice
of
being
witnesses
it
would
probably
hurt
their
business
but
however
much
faked
news
may
be
published
a
prosecutor
who
did
not
listen
to
all
the
hints
the
press
boys
had
to
give
would
make
a
great
mistake
and
as
allies
and
advisers
they
are
often
invaluable
for
they
can
tell
him
where
and
how
to
get
evidence
of
which
otherwise
he
would
never
hear
the
week
before
a
great
case
is
called
is
a
busy
one
for
the
prosecutor
in
charge
he
is
at
his
office
early
to
interview
his
main
witnesses
and
go
over
their
testimony
with
them
so
that
their
regular
daily
work
may
not
be
interrupted
more
than
shall
be
actually
necessary
some
he
cautions
against
being
overenthusiastic
and
others
he
encourages
to
greater
emphasis
the
bashful
cop
is
badgered
until
at
last
he
ceases
to
begin
his
testimony
in
the
police
fashion
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
about
while
on
post
at
the
corner
of
desbrosses
street
he
starts
oh
quit
that
shouts
the
district
attorney
tell
me
what
you
saw
in
your
own
words
the
cop
blushes
and
stammers
aw
well
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
about
look
here
yells
the
prosecutor
jumping
to
his
feet
and
shaking
his
fist
at
him
do
you
want
to
be
taken
for
a
d
n
liar
of
the
of
july
about
while
on
post
i
you
never
talked
like
that
in
your
life
by
this
time
the
cop
is
mad
clear
through
i
no
liar
he
retorts
i
saw
the
pull
his
gun
and
shoot
well
why
did
you
say
so
laughs
the
prosecutor
and
the
officer
mollified
with
a
cigar
dimly
perceives
the
objectionable
feature
of
his
testimony
about
this
time
one
of
the
sleuths
comes
in
to
report
that
certain
witnesses
have
been
located
and
are
in
custody
downstairs
the
assistant
makes
immediate
preparation
for
taking
their
statements
then
one
of
the
experts
comes
in
for
a
chat
about
a
new
phase
of
the
case
occasioned
by
the
discovery
that
the
defendant
actually
did
have
spasms
when
an
infant
the
assistant
wisely
makes
an
appointment
for
the
evening
a
telegram
arrives
saying
that
a
witness
for
the
defence
has
just
started
for
new
york
from
philadelphia
and
should
be
duly
watched
on
arrival
the
district
attorney
sends
for
the
assistant
to
inquire
if
he
has
looked
up
the
law
on
similar
cases
in
texas
and
alabama
which
he
probably
has
not
done
and
a
friend
on
the
telephone
informs
him
that
tomkins
who
has
been
drawn
on
the
jury
is
a
boon
companion
of
the
prisoner
and
was
accustomed
to
play
bridge
with
him
every
sunday
night
before
the
murder
coincidently
some
private
detectives
enter
with
a
long
report
on
the
various
members
of
the
panel
including
the
aforesaid
tomkins
whom
they
pronounce
to
be
all
right
and
as
never
having
to
their
knowledge
laid
eyes
on
the
accused
finally
in
despair
the
prosecutor
locks
himself
in
his
library
with
a
copy
of
the
bible
bartlett
familiar
quotations
and
a
volume
of
celebrated
speeches
to
prepare
his
summing
up
for
no
careful
trial
lawyer
opens
a
case
without
first
having
prepared
to
some
extent
at
least
his
closing
address
to
the
jury
he
has
thought
about
this
for
weeks
and
perhaps
for
months
in
his
dreams
he
has
formulated
syllogisms
and
delivered
them
to
imaginary
yet
obstinate
talesman
he
has
glanced
through
many
volumes
for
similes
and
quotations
of
pertinency
he
has
tried
various
arguments
on
his
friends
until
he
knows
just
how
if
he
succeeds
in
proving
certain
facts
and
the
defence
expected
is
interposed
he
is
going
to
convince
the
twelve
jurors
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
perhaps
win
an
everlasting
reputation
as
an
orator
himself
this
superficial
sketch
of
how
an
important
criminal
case
is
got
ready
for
trial
would
be
incomplete
without
some
further
reference
to
something
which
has
been
briefly
hinted
at
before
preparation
upon
its
purely
legal
aspect
this
may
well
demand
almost
as
much
labor
as
that
required
in
amassing
the
evidence
yet
a
careful
and
painstaking
investigation
of
the
law
governing
every
aspect
of
the
case
is
indispensable
to
success
the
prosecutor
with
a
perfectly
clear
case
may
see
the
defendant
walk
out
of
court
a
free
man
simply
because
he
has
neglected
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
various
points
of
law
which
may
arise
in
the
course
of
the
trial
and
the
lawyer
for
an
accused
may
find
his
client
convicted
upon
a
charge
to
which
he
has
a
perfectly
good
legal
defence
for
the
same
reason
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
prisoner
counsel
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
quite
as
efficacious
to
free
your
client
on
a
point
of
law
without
having
the
case
go
to
the
jury
at
all
as
to
secure
an
acquittal
at
their
hands
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
introduced
in
behalf
of
the
state
there
is
always
a
motion
made
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
of
alleged
insufficiency
in
the
proof
this
has
usually
been
made
the
subject
of
the
most
exhaustive
study
by
the
lawyers
for
the
defence
and
requires
equal
preparation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
the
writer
recalls
trying
a
bankrupt
charged
with
fraud
where
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
had
written
a
brief
of
some
three
hundred
pages
upon
the
points
of
law
which
he
proposed
to
argue
to
the
court
upon
his
motion
to
acquit
but
unfortunately
his
client
pleaded
guilty
and
the
volume
was
never
brought
into
play
but
a
mastery
of
the
law
a
thorough
knowledge
and
control
of
the
evidence
a
careful
preparation
for
the
opening
and
closing
addresses
and
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
panel
from
which
the
jury
is
to
be
drawn
are
by
no
means
the
only
elements
in
the
preparation
for
a
great
legal
battle
one
thing
still
remains
quite
as
important
as
the
rest
the
selection
of
the
best
time
and
the
best
court
for
the
trial
a
good
beginning
in
a
criminal
case
means
a
beginning
before
the
right
judge
the
proper
jury
and
at
a
time
when
that
vague
but
important
influence
known
as
public
opinion
augurs
success
a
clever
criminal
lawyer
be
he
prosecutor
or
lawyer
for
the
defendant
knows
that
all
the
preparation
in
the
world
is
of
no
account
provided
his
case
is
to
come
before
a
stupid
or
biased
judge
or
a
prejudiced
or
obstinate
jury
therefore
each
side
in
a
legal
battle
of
importance
studies
as
well
as
it
can
the
character
connections
and
cast
of
mind
of
the
different
judges
who
may
be
called
upon
to
hear
the
case
and
like
a
jockey
at
the
flag
tries
to
hurry
or
delay
as
the
case
may
be
until
the
judicial
auspices
appear
most
favorable
a
lawyer
who
has
a
weak
defence
seeks
to
bring
the
case
before
a
weak
judge
or
if
public
clamor
is
loud
against
his
client
makes
use
of
every
technical
artifice
to
secure
delay
by
claiming
that
there
are
flaws
in
the
indictment
or
by
moving
for
commissions
to
take
testimony
in
distant
points
of
the
country
the
opportunities
for
legal
procrastination
are
so
numerous
that
in
a
complicated
case
the
defence
may
often
delay
matters
for
over
a
year
this
may
be
an
important
factor
in
the
final
result
yet
even
this
is
not
enough
for
ultimately
it
is
the
judge
charge
to
the
jury
which
is
going
to
guide
their
deliberations
and
in
large
measure
determine
their
verdict
the
lawyers
for
the
defence
therefore
prepare
long
statements
of
what
they
either
believe
or
pretend
to
believe
to
be
the
law
these
statements
embrace
all
the
legal
propositions
good
or
bad
favorable
to
their
side
of
the
case
if
they
can
induce
the
judge
to
follow
these
so
much
the
better
for
their
client
for
even
if
they
are
not
law
it
makes
no
difference
since
the
state
has
no
appeal
from
an
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case
no
matter
how
much
the
judge
has
erred
in
the
same
way
but
not
in
quite
the
same
fashion
the
district
attorney
prepares
requests
to
charge
but
his
desire
for
favorable
instructions
should
be
and
generally
is
curbed
by
the
consideration
that
if
the
judge
makes
any
mistake
in
the
law
and
the
defendant
is
convicted
he
can
appeal
and
upset
the
case
of
course
some
prosecutors
are
so
anxious
to
convict
that
they
will
wheedle
or
deceive
a
judge
into
giving
charges
which
are
not
only
most
inimical
to
the
prisoner
but
so
utterly
unsound
that
a
reversal
is
sure
to
follow
but
when
one
of
these
professional
bloodhounds
is
baying
upon
the
trail
all
he
thinks
of
is
a
conviction
that
is
all
he
wants
all
the
public
will
remember
to
him
will
be
the
glory
and
when
the
case
is
finally
reversed
he
will
probably
be
out
of
office
these
requests
cover
pages
and
touch
upon
every
phase
of
law
applicable
or
inapplicable
to
the
case
frequently
they
number
as
many
as
fifty
sometimes
many
more
it
is
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
off
the
bat
which
are
right
and
which
are
wrong
if
he
guesses
that
the
right
one
is
wrong
or
the
wrong
one
right
the
defendant
gets
a
new
trial
chapter
iii
sensationalism
and
jury
trials
for
the
past
years
we
have
heard
the
cry
upon
all
sides
that
the
jury
system
is
a
failure
and
to
this
general
indictment
is
frequently
added
the
specification
that
the
trials
in
our
higher
courts
of
criminal
justice
are
the
scenes
of
grotesque
buffoonery
and
merriment
where
cynical
juries
recklessly
disregard
their
oaths
and
where
morbid
crowds
flock
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
their
imaginations
for
details
of
blood
and
sexuality
it
is
unnecessary
to
question
the
honesty
of
those
who
thus
picture
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
america
indeed
thus
it
probably
appears
to
them
but
before
such
an
arraignment
of
present
conditions
in
a
highly
civilized
and
progressive
nation
is
accepted
as
final
it
is
well
to
examine
into
its
inherent
probabilities
and
test
it
by
what
we
know
of
the
actual
facts
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
jury
was
instituted
and
designed
to
protect
the
english
freeman
from
tyranny
upon
the
part
of
the
crown
judges
were
and
sometimes
still
are
the
creatures
of
a
ruler
or
unduly
subject
to
his
influence
and
that
ruler
neither
was
nor
is
always
the
head
of
the
nation
but
just
as
in
the
days
of
the
normans
he
might
have
been
a
powerful
earl
whose
influence
could
make
or
unmake
a
judge
so
he
may
be
none
the
less
a
ruler
if
he
exists
in
the
person
of
a
political
boss
who
has
created
the
judge
before
whom
his
political
enemy
is
to
be
tried
the
writer
has
seen
more
than
one
judge
openly
striving
to
influence
a
jury
to
convict
or
to
acquit
a
prisoner
at
the
dictation
of
such
a
boss
who
not
content
to
issue
his
commands
from
behind
the
arras
came
to
the
courtroom
and
ascended
the
bench
to
see
that
they
were
obeyed
usually
the
jury
indignantly
resented
such
interference
and
administered
a
rebuke
by
acting
directly
contrary
to
the
clearly
indicated
wishes
of
the
judge
but
while
admitting
its
theoretic
value
as
a
bulwark
of
liberty
the
modern
assailant
of
the
jury
brushes
the
consideration
aside
by
asserting
that
the
system
has
broken
down
and
degenerated
into
a
farce
let
us
now
see
how
much
of
a
farce
it
is
if
four
times
out
of
five
a
judge
rendered
decisions
that
met
with
general
approval
he
would
probably
be
accounted
a
highly
satisfactory
judge
now
out
of
every
one
hundred
indicted
prisoners
brought
to
the
bar
for
trial
probably
fifteen
ought
to
be
acquitted
if
prosecuted
impartially
and
in
accordance
with
the
strict
rules
of

the
year
the
juries
of

york
county

per
cent
of
the

before

if
we
are
to
test
fairly
the
efficiency
of
the
system
we
must
deduct
from
the
acquittals
remaining
the
fifteen
acquittals
which
were
justifiable
by
so
doing
we
shall
find
that
in
the
year
the
new
york
county
juries
did
the
correct
thing
in
about
cases
out
of
every
hundred
this
is
a
high
percentage
of
efficiency
is
it
likely
that
any
judge
would
have
done
much
better

per

after
a
rather
long
experience
as
a
prosecutor
in
which
he
conducted
many
hundreds
of
criminal
cases
the
writer
believes
that
the
ordinary
new
york
city
jury
finds
a
correct
general
verdict
four
times
out
of
five
as
to
talesmen
in
other
localities
he
has
no
knowledge
or
reliable
information
it
seems
hardly
possible
however
that
juries
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
could
be
more
heterogeneous
or
less
intelligent
than
those
before
which
he
formed
his
conclusions
of
course
jury
judgments
are
sometimes
flagrantly
wrong
but
there
are
many
verdicts
popularly
regarded
as
examples
of
lawlessness
which
if
examined
calmly
and
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
evidence
would
be
found
to
be
the
reasonable
acts
of
honest
and
intelligent
juries
for
example
the
acquittal
of
thaw
upon
the
ground
of
insanity
is
usually
spoken
of
as
an
illustration
of
sentimentality
on
the
part
of
jurymen
and
of
their
willingness
to
be
swayed
by
their
emotions
where
a
woman
is
involved
but
few
clearer
cases
of
insanity
have
been
established
in
a
court
of
justice
the
district
attorney
own
experts
had
pronounced
the
defendant
a
hopeless
paranoiac
the
prosecutor
had
at
a
previous
trial
openly
declared
the
same
to
be
his
own
opinion
and
the
evidence
was
convincing
at
the
time
it
was
rendered
the
verdict
was
accepted
as
a
foregone
conclusion
the
case
is
commonly
cited
as
proof
of
the
gullibility
of
juries
and
of
the
impossibility
of
convicting
a
rich
man
of
a
crime
there
will
always
be
some
persons
who
think
that
every
defendant
should
be
convicted
and
feel
aggrieved
if
he
is
turned
out
by
the
jury
yet
they
entirely
forget
in
their
displeasure
at
the
acquittal
of
a
man
whom
they
instinctively
know
to
be
guilty
that
the
jury
probably
had
exactly
the
same
impression
but
were
obliged
under
their
oaths
to
acquit
because
of
an
insufficiency
of
evidence
an
excellent
illustration
of
such
a
case
is
that
of
nan
patterson
she
is
commonly
supposed
to
have
attended
upon
the
night
of
her
acquittal
a
banquet
at
which
one
of
her
lawyers
toasted
her
as
the
guilty
girl
who
beat
the
case
whether
she
was
guilty
or
not
there
is
a
general
impression
that
she
murdered
caesar
young
yet
the
writer
who
was
present
throughout
the
trial
felt
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
that
there
was
a
fairly
reasonable
doubt
of
her
guilt
even
so
the
jury
disagreed
although
the
case
is
usually
referred
to
as
an
acquittal
and
a
monument
to
the
sentimentality
of
juries
the
acquittal
of
roland
molineux
is
also
recalled
as
a
case
where
a
man
previously
proved
guilty
managed
to
escape
the
writer
who
was
then
an
assistant
district
attorney
made
a
careful
study
of
the
evidence
at
the
time
and
feels
confident
that
the
great
majority
of
the
legal
profession
would
agree
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
choice
but
to
reverse
the
defendant
first
conviction
on
account
of
the
most
prejudicial
error
committed
at
the
trial
and
that
the
jury
who
acquitted
him
upon
the
second
occasion
had
equally
no
choice
when
the
case
was
presented
with
a
proper
regard
to
the
rules
of
evidence
and
procedure
indeed
on
the
second
trial
the
evidence
pointed
almost
as
convincingly
toward
another
person
as
toward
the
defendant
i
have
mentioned
the
patterson
thaw
and
molineux
trials
because
they
are
cases
commonly
referred
to
in
support
of
the
general
contention
that
the
jury
system
is
a
failure
but
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
any
single
judge
bench
of
judges
or
board
of
commissioners
would
have
reached
the
same
result
as
the
juries
did
in
these
instances
it
is
quite
true
that
juries
for
rather
obvious
reasons
are
more
apt
to
acquit
in
murder
cases
than
in
others
in
the
first
place
save
where
the
defendant
obviously
belongs
to
the
vicious
criminal
class
a
jury
finds
it
somewhat
difficult
to
believe
unless
overwhelming
motive
be
shown
that
he
could
have
deliberately
taken
another
life
thus
with
sound
reason
they
give
great
weight
to
the
plea
of
which
the
accused
urges
upon
them
he
is
generally
the
only
witness
his
story
has
to
be
disproved
by
circumstantial
evidence
if
indeed
there
be
any
frequently
it
stands
alone
as
the
only
account
of
the
homicide
thus
murder
cases
are
almost
always
weaker
than
others
since
the
chief
witness
has
been
removed
by
death
while
at
the
same
time
the
nature
of
the
punishment
leads
the
jury
unconsciously
to
require
a
higher
degree
of
proof
than
in
cases
where
the
consequences
are
less
abhorrent
all
this
is
quite
natural
and
inevitable
moreover
homicide
cases
as
a
rule
are
better
defended
than
others
a
fact
which
undoubtedly
affects
the
result
these
considerations
apply
to
all
trials
for
homicide
notorious
or
otherwise
the
results
of
which
in
new
york
county
for
ten
years
are
set
forth
in
the
following
table
year
convictions
acquittals
convictions
acquittals
per

per

total
av
a
popular
impression
exists
at
the
present
time
that
a
man
convicted
of
murder
has
but
to
appeal
his
case
on
some
technical
ground
in
order
to
secure
a
reversal
and
thus
escape
the
consequences
of
his
crime
how
wide
of
the
mark
such
a
belief
may
be
at
least
so
far
as
one
locality
is
concerned
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
new
york
state
from
to
there
were
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeals
from
convictions
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
out
of
which
there
were
only
reversals
seven
of
these
defendants
were
again
immediately
tried
and
convicted
and
a
second
time
appealed
upon
which
occasion
only
two
were
successful
while
five
had
their
convictions
promptly
affirmed
thus
so
far
as
the
ultimate
triumph
of
justice
is
concerned
out
of
cases
in
that
period
the
appellants
finally
succeeded
in
only
since
there
have
been
decisions
rendered
in
murder
cases
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
only
three
reversals
written
in
the
more
important
convictions
throughout
the
state
are
affirmed
with
great
regularity
as
to
the
conduct
of
such
cases
the
writer
own
experience
is
that
a
murder
trial
is
the
most
solemn
proceeding
known
to
the
law
he
has
prosecuted
at
least
fifty
men
for
murder
and
convicted
more
than
he
cares
to
remember
such
trials
are
invariably
dignified
and
deliberate
so
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
legal
side
of
the
case
is
concerned
no
judge
however
unqualified
for
the
bench
no
prosecutor
however
no
lawyer
however
callous
fails
to
feel
the
serious
nature
of
the
transaction
or
to
be
affected
strongly
by
the
fact
that
he
is
dealing
with
life
and
death
a
prosecutor
who
openly
laughed
or
sneered
at
a
prisoner
charged
with
murder
would
severely
injure
his
cause
the
jury
naturally
are
overwhelmed
with
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
and
the
responsibility
resting
upon
them
in
the
patterson
thaw
and
molineux
cases
the
evidence
unfortunately
dealt
with
unpleasant
subjects
and
at
times
was
revolting
but
there
was
a
quiet
propriety
in
the
way
in
which
the
witnesses
were
examined
that
rendered
it
as
inoffensive
as
it
could
possibly
be
outside
the
the
vulgar
crowd
may
have
spat
and
sworn
and
inside
no
doubt
there
were
degenerate
men
and
women
who
eagerly
strained
their
ears
to
catch
every
item
of
depravity
but
the
throngs
that
filled
the
courtroom
were
quiet
and
well
ordered
and
the
justified
interested
outnumbered
the
morbid
the
writer
deprecates
the
impulse
which
leads
judges
from
a
feeling
that
justice
should
be
publicly
administered
to
throw
wide
the
doors
of
every
courtroom
irrespective
of
the
of
the
trial
we
need
have
no
fear
of
star
chamber
proceedings
in
america
and
no
harm
would
be
done
by
excluding
from
the
courtroom
all
persons
who
have
no
business
there
it
is
of
course
not
unnatural
that
in
the
course
of
a
trial
occupying
weeks
or
months
the
tension
should
occasionally
be
relieved
by
a
gleam
of
humor
after
one
has
been
busy
trying
a
case
for
a
couple
of
weeks
one
goes
to
court
and
sets
to
work
in
much
the
same
frame
of
mind
in
which
one
would
attack
any
other
business
but
the
fact
that
a
small
boy
sometimes
sees
something
funny
at
a
funeral
or
a
bevy
of
giggling
may
be
sitting
in
the
gallery
at
a
fashionable
wedding
argues
little
in
respect
to
the
solemnity
or
beauty
of
the
service
itself
what
are
the
celebrated
cases
the
trials
that
attract
the
attention
and
interest
of
the
public
in
the
first
place
they
are
the
very
cases
which
contain
those
elements
most
likely
to
arouse
the
sympathy
and
prejudices
of
a
jury
where
a
girl
has
taken
the
life
of
her
supposed
seducer
or
a
husband
has
avenged
his
wife
alleged
dishonor
such
cases
arouse
the
public
imagination
for
the
very
reason
that
every
man
realizes
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
genuine
tragedy
of
this
character
the
legal
and
the
natural
thus
aside
from
any
other
consideration
they
are
the
obvious
instances
where
justice
is
most
likely
to
go
astray
in
the
next
place
the
defence
is
usually
in
the
hands
of
counsel
of
adroitness
and
ability
for
even
if
the
prisoner
has
no
money
to
pay
his
lawyer
the
latter
is
willing
to
take
the
case
for
the
advertising
he
will
get
out
of
it
third
a
trial
which
lasts
for
a
long
time
naturally
results
in
creating
in
the
jury
mind
an
exaggerated
idea
of
the
prisoner
rights
namely
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
benefit
of
the
reasonable
doubt
for
every
time
that
the
jury
will
hear
these
phrases
once
in
a
petty
larceny
or
forgery
case
they
will
hear
them
in
a
lengthy
murder
trial
a
hundred
times
they
see
the
defendant
day
after
day
and
the
relation
becomes
more
personal
their
responsibility
seems
greater
toward
him
than
toward
the
defendant
in
petty
cases
last
as
previously
suggested
murder
cases
are
apt
to
be
inherently
weaker
than
others
and
more
often
depend
upon
circumstantial
evidence
the
results
of
such
cases
are
therefore
an
inadequate
test
of
the
efficiency
of
a
jury
system
they
are
in
fact
the
precise
cases
where
if
at
all
the
jury
might
be
expected
to
go
wrong
but
juries
would
go
astray
far
less
frequently
even
in
such
trials
were
it
not
for
that
most
vicious
factor
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
the
yellow
journal
for
the
impression
that
public
trials
are
the
scenes
of
buffoonery
and
brutality
is
due
to
the
manner
in
which
these
trials
are
exploited
by
the
sensational
papers
the
instant
that
a
sensational
homicide
occurs
the
aim
of
the
editors
of
these
papers
is
not
to
see
that
a
swift
and
sure
retribution
is
visited
upon
the
guilty
or
that
a
prompt
and
unqualified
vindication
is
accorded
to
the
innocent
but
on
the
contrary
so
to
handle
the
matter
that
as
many
highly
colored
stories
as
possible
can
be
run
about
it
thus
where
the
case
is
perfectly
clear
against
the
prisoner
the
yellow
press
seeks
to
bolster
up
the
defence
and
really
to
justify
the
killing
by
a
thinly
disguised
appeal
to
the
readers
passions
not
infrequently
while
the
editorial
page
is
mourning
the
prevalence
of
homicide
the
front
columns
are
bristling
with
sensational
accounts
of
the
of
the
injured
husband
the
heartbreaking
confession
of
the
weak
and
erring
wife
and
the
sneering
nonchalance
of
the
seducer
until
a
public
sentiment
is
created
which
if
it
outwardly
deprecates
the
invocation
of
the
unwritten
law
secretly
avows
that
it
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
the
prisoner
place
this
antecedent
public
sentiment
is
fostered
from
day
to
day
until
it
has
unconsciously
permeated
every
corner
of
the
community
the
juryman
will
swear
that
he
is
unaffected
by
what
he
has
read
but
unknown
to
himself
there
are
already
tiny
furrows
in
his
brain
along
which
the
appeal
of
the
defence
will
run
in
view
of
this
deliberate
perversion
of
truth
and
morals
the
euphemisms
of
a
defendant
counsel
when
he
pictures
a
chorus
girl
as
an
angel
and
a
coarse
bounder
as
a
george
seem
innocent
indeed
it
is
not
within
the
rail
of
the
courtroom
but
within
the
pages
of
these
sensational
journals
that
justice
is
made
a
farce
the
phrase
contempt
of
court
has
ceased
practically
to
have
any
significance
whatever
the
front
pages
teem
with
caricatures
of
the
judge
upon
the
bench
of
the
individual
jurors
with
exaggerated
heads
upon
impossible
bodies
of
the
lawyers
ranting
and
bellowing
juxtaposed
with
sketches
of
the
defendant
praying
beside
his
prison
cot
or
firing
the
fatal
shot
in
obedience
to
a
message
borne
by
an
angel
from
on
high
how
long
would
the
unwritten
law
play
any
part
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
if
every
paper
in
the
land
united
in
demanding
not
only
in
its
editorials
but
upon
its
front
pages
that
private
vengeance
must
cease
let
the
yellow
newspapers
confine
themselves
simply
to
an
accurate
report
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial
with
a
reiterated
insistence
that
the
law
must
take
its
course
let
them
stop
pandering
to
those
morbid
tastes
which
they
have
themselves
created
let
the
sympathy
sisters
the
photographer
and
the
special
artist
be
excluded
from
the
when
these
things
are
done
we
shall
have
the

standard
of
efficiency

the
part
of
the

in
great

chapter

why
do
men
kill
when
a
shrewd
but
genial
editor
called
me
up
on
the
telephone
and
asked
me
how
i
should
like
to
write
an
article
on
the
above
lurid
title
i
laughed
in
his
i
mean
the
telephone
face
my
dear
fellow
i
said
i
should
only
have
the
nerve
to
call
him
that
over
a
wire
it
would
ruin
me
how
could
i
keep
my
and
write

kind
of
sensational
stuff
why

kill
why
do
men

why
do

why

why
do

look

he
interrupted
i
want
to
know
why
one
man
kills
another
man
if
we
knew
why
maybe
we
could
stop
it
could
we
we
could
try
to
anyhow
and
you
know
something
about
it
you
prosecuted
nearly

get
the

i
want
cut
the

get
down
to

anything
particularly
undignified
about
that
and
he
rang
off
i
arose
and
walked
over
to
the
bookcase
on
which
reposed
several
shelves
of
minutes
of
criminal
trials
they
were
dusty
and
depressing
practically
every
one
of
them
was
a
memento
of
some
poor
devil
gone
to
prison
or
to
the
chair
where
were
they
now
and
why
did
they

yes
why
did
they
i
glanced
along

why

the

was

in

out
of

the

jealousy

how
can
you

i
began
to
get
interested
supposing
i
dug
out

i
had
ever
tried
what
would

years
what
other
motives
had
the
defendants

had
there
was

an
italian
camorrista
he
had
killed
simply
for
the
distinction
it
gave
him
among
his

and
the
satisfaction
he
felt
at
being
known
as
a

there
was

a
deliberate

planned
in
advance
by
several
of
a
gang
to
get
rid
of
a
young
bully
who
had
made
himself
generally
unpleasant
there
was
childs
who
had
killed
as
he
claimed
in
because
he
was
set
upon
and
assaulted
by
rival
runners
from
another
seaman
boarding
house
really
it
began
to
look
as
if
men
killed
for
a
lot
of
reasons
one
consideration
at
once
suggested
itself
how
about
the
killings
where
the
murderer
is
never
caught
the
prisoners
tried
for
murder
are
only
a
mere
fraction
of
those
who
commit
murder
true
and
the
more
deliberate
the
murder
the
greater
unfortunately
the
chance
of
the
villain
getting
away
still
in
cases
merely
of
suspected
murder
or
in
cases
where
no
evidence
is
taken
it
would
be
manifestly
unfair
arbitrarily
to
assign
motives
for
the
deed
if
deed
it
was
no
one
must
start
with
the
assumption
sufficiently
accurate
under
all
the
circumstances
that
the
killings
in
which
the
killer
is
caught
are
fairly
representative
of
killings
as
a
whole
all
crimes
naturally
tend
to
divide
themselves
into
two
classes
crimes
against
property
and
crimes
against
the
person
each
class
having
an
entirely
different
assortment
of
reasons
for
their
commission
there
can
be
practically
but
one
motive
for
theft
burglary
or
robbery
it
is
of
course
conceivable
that
such
crimes
might
be
perpetrated
for
revenge
to
deprive
the
victim
of
some
highly
prized
possession
but
in
the
main
there
is
only
one
object
unlawful
gain
so
too
blackmail
extortion
and
kidnapping
are
all
the
products
of
the
desire
for
easy
money
but
unquestionably
this
is
the
reason
for
murder
in
comparatively
few
cases
the
usual
motive
for
crimes
against
the
person
assault
manslaughter
mayhem
murder
is
the
desire
to
punish
or
be
avenged
upon
another
by
inflicting
personal
pain
upon
him
or
by
depriving
him
of
his
most
valuable
asset
life
and
this
desire
for
retaliation
or
revenge
generally
grows
out
of
a
recent
humiliation
received
at
the
hands
of
the
other
person
a
real
or
fancied
wrong
to
oneself
a
member
of
one
family
or
one
property
but
this
was
too
easy
an
answer
to
my
friend
question
he
wanted
and
deserved
more
than
that
and
i
set
out
to
give
it
to
him
my
first
inquiry
was
in
the
direction
of
original
sources
i
sought
out
the
man
in
the
district
attorney
office
who
had
had
the
widest
general
experience
and
put
the
question
to
him
this
was
charles
nott
now
judge
of
the
general
sessions
who
had
been
trying
murder
cases
for
nearly
ten
years
it
so
happened
that
he
had
kept
a
complete
record
of
all
of
them
and
this
he
courteously
placed
at
my
disposal
the
list
contains
cases
and
the
defendants
were
of
divers
races
these
homicides
included
seventeen
committed
in
cold
blood
about
per
cent
an
extraordinary
percentage
from
varying
motives
as
follows
one
defendant
white
murdered
his
colored
mistress
simply
to
get
rid
of
her
another
killed
out
of
revenge
because
the
deceased
had
licked
him
several
times
before
another
having
quarrelled
with
his
friend
over
a
glass
of
soda
water
later
on
returned
and
precipitated
a
quarrel
by
striking
him
in
the
course
of
which
he
killed
him
another
because
the
deceased
had
induced
his
wife
to
desert
him
another
lay
in
wait
for
his
victim
and
killed
him
without
the
motive
ever
being
ascertained
one
man
killed
his
brother
to
get
a
sum
of
money
and
another
because
his
brother
would
not
give
him
money
another
because
he
believed
the
deceased
had
betrayed
the
armenian
cause
to
the
turks
another
because
he
wished
to
get
the
deceased
out
of
the
way
in
order
to
marry
his
wife
and
another
because
deceased
had
knocked
him
down
the
day
before
one
man
had
killed
a
girl
who
had
ridiculed
him
and
one
a
girl
who
had
refused
to
marry
him
another
had
killed
his
daughter
because
she
could
no
longer
live
in
the
house
with
him
one
an
informer
had
been
the
victim
of
a
black
hand
vendetta
and
the
last
had
poisoned
his
wife
for
the
insurance
money
in
order
to
go
off
with
another
woman
there
were
two
cases
of
infanticide
one
in
which
a
woman
threw
her
baby
into
the
lake
in
central
park
and
another
in
which
she
gave
her
baby
poison
besides
these
murders
five
homicides
had
been
committed
in
the
course
of
perpetrating
other
crimes
including
burglary
and
robbery
passing
over
three
cases
of
culpable
negligence
resulting
in
death
we
come
to
homicides
during
quarrels
some
of
which
might
have
been
technically
classified
as
murders
but
which
being
committed
in
the
heat
of
passion
in
practically
every
instance
resulted
in
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
the
quarrels
often
arose
over
the
most
trifling
matters
one
was
a
dispute
over
a
broom
another
over
a
horse
blanket
another
over
food
another
over
a
cent
bet
in
a
pool
game
another
over
a
loan
of
fifty
cents
another
over
ten
cents
in
a
crap
game
and
still
another
over
one
dollar
and
thirty
cents
in
a
crap
game
five
men
were
killed
in
drunken
rows
which
had
no
immediate
cause
except
the
desire
to
start
something
one
man
killed
another
because
he
had
not
prevented
the
theft
of
some
lumber
one
a
policeman
because
the
deceased
would
not
move
on
when
ordered
one
because
a
bartender
refused
to
serve
him
with
any
more
drinks
and
one
a
bartender
because
the
deceased
insisted
that
he
should
serve
more
drinks
one
man
was
killed
in
a
quarrel
over
politics
one
in
a
fuss
over
some
beer
one
in
a
card
game
one
trying
to
rob
a
one
in
a
dispute
with
a
ship
officer
one
in
a
dance
hall
row
one
man
killed
another
whom
he
found
with
his
wife
and
one
wife
killed
her
husband
for
a
similar
cause
another
wife
killed
her
husband
simply
because
she
could
not
stand
him
and
one
because
he
was
fighting
with
their
son
one
man
was
killed
by
another
who
was
trying
to
collect
from
him
a
debt
of
six
hundred
dollars
one
quarrel
resulting
in
homicide
arose
because
the
defendant
had
pointed
out
deceased
to
the
police
another
because
the
participants
called
each
other
names
and
another
arose
out
of
an
alleged
seduction
three
homicides
grew
out
of
street
rows
originating
in
various
ways
one
man
killed
another
who
was
fighting
with
a
friend
of
the
first
a
janitor
was
killed
in
a
continuous
row
which
had
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
and
one
homicide
was
committed
for
nothing
in
particular
this
astonishing
olla
podrida
of
reasons
for
depriving
men
of
their
lives
leaves
one
stunned
and
confused
is
it
possible
to
deduce
any
order
out
of
such
homicidal
chaos
still
an
attempt
to
classify
such
diverse
causes
enables
one
to
reach
certain
general
conclusions
out
of
the
homicides
there
were
seventeen
murders
with
deliberation
and
premeditation
in
such
cases
the
reasons
for
the
killing
are
by
comparison
unimportant
three
homicides
due
to
negligence
five
committed
while
perpetrating
a
felony
manslaughters
due
in
sixteen
cases
to
quarrels
simply
thirteen
to
drink
four
to
disputes
over
money
three
to
women
one
to
race
antagonism
reclassifying
the
seventeen
murders
according
to
causes
we
have
six
due
to
women
four
to
quarrels
five
to
other
causes
and
two
infanticides
added
to
the
manslaughters
previously
classified
we
have
a
total
of
killings
due
in
twenty
cases
to
quarrels
thirteen
to
drink
nine
to
women
four
to
disputes
over
money
one
to
race
antagonism
five
to
general
causes
three
to
negligence
two
infanticides
five
during
the
commission
of
other
crimes
the
significant
features
of
this
analysis
are
that
about
per
cent
of
the
killings
were
due
to
quarrels
over
small
sums
or
other
matters
drink
and
women
over
fifty
per
cent
to
drink
and
petty
quarrels
and
about
thirty
per
cent
to
quarrels
simply
the
trifling
character
of
the
causes
of
the
quarrels
themselves
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
three
of
these
particular
cases
tried
in
a
single
week
the
total
amount
involved
in
the
disputes
was
only
cents
that
is
about
and
cents
a
life
many
a
murder
in
a
barroom
grows
out
of
an
argument
over
whether
a
glass
of
beer
has
or
has
not
been
paid
for
or
whose
turn
it
is
to
treat
and
more
than
one
man
has
been
killed
in
new
york
city
because
he
was
too
clumsy
to
avoid
stepping
on
somebody
feet
or
bumping
into
another
man
on
the
sidewalk
the
writer
sincerely
regrets
that
his
own
lack
of
initiative
prevented
his
keeping
a
diary
during
his
seven
years
service
as
a
prosecutor
it
is
now
impossible
for
him
to
refresh
his
memory
as
to
the
causes
of
all
the
various
homicides
which
he
prosecuted
but
where
he
can
do
so
the
evidence
points
to
a
conclusion
similar
to
that
deduced
from
record
the
proximate
causes
were
trifling
the
underlying
cause
was
the
lack
of
civilization
of
the
defendant
his
brutality
and
absence
of
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
conditions
in
general
throughout
the
united
states
i
asked
a
clipping
agency
to
send
me
the
first
one
hundred
notices
of
actual
homicides
which
should
come
under
its
scissors
the
immediate
result
of
this
experiment
was
that
i
received
notices
supposedly
relating
to
murders
and
homicides
which
on
closer
examination
proved
to
be
anything
but
what
i
wanted
for
the
purpose
in
view
with
only
one
or
two
exceptions
they
related
not
to
deaths
from
violence
reported
as
having
occurred
on
any
particular
day
but
to
notices
of
convictions
acquittals
indictments
pleas
of
guilty
and
not
guilty
rewards
offered
sentences
executions
suspicions
of
the
police
mysteries
revived
and
even
editorials
on
capital
punishment
a
letter
of
protest
brought
in
due
course
but
much
more
slowly
one
hundred
and
seven
clippings
which
yielded
the
following
reasons
why
men
killed
there
were
four
suicides
three
lynchings
one
infanticide
three
murders
while
resisting
arrest
three
criminals
killed
while
resisting
arrest
two
men
killed
in
riots
eight
murders
in
the
course
of
committing
burglaries
and
robberies
seven
persons
killed
in
vendettas
three
grace
murders
and
killed
in
quarrels
over
petty
causes
there
were
twelve
murders
from
jealousy
followed
in
four
instances
by
suicide
on
the
part
of
the
murderer
six
killings
justifiable
on
the
higher
law
theory
only
but
involving
great
provocation
and
thirty
deliberate
slaughters
the
last
clipping
recounted
how
an
irate
husband
pounded
a
masher
so
hard
that
he
died
leaving
out
the
suicides
and
those
killed
while
resisting
arrest
there
remain
one
hundred
persons
murdered
not
only
by
persons
insane
or
wild
from
the
effects
of
liquor
but
by
robbers
and
burglars
brutes
bullies
and
thugs
husbands
wives
and
lovers
and
by
a
vast
number
of
people
who
not
only
destroyed
their
enemies
in
the
fury
of
anger
but
in
many
instances
openly
went
out
gunning
for
them
lay
in
wait
for
them
in
the
dark
or
hacked
off
their
heads
with
hatchets
while
they
slept
it
is
indeed
a
sanguinary
record
from
which
little
consolation
is
to
be
derived
and
the
only
comfort
is
the
probability
that
the
accounts
of
the
first
one
hundred
murders
anywhere
in
europe
would
undoubtedly
be
just
as
i
had
simply
asked
the
clipping
bureau
to
send
me
one
hundred
horrors
and
i
had
got
them
they
did
not
indicate
anything
at
all
so
far
as
the
ratio
of
homicide
to
population
was
concerned
or
as
to
the
bloodthirstiness
of
americans
in
general
they
merely
showed
what
despicable
things
murders
were
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
killings
they
were
as
diverse
as
those
which
nott
had
prosecuted
save
that
there
were
more
of
an
ultra
character
due
probably
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
who
did
the
clipping
wanted
after
one
rebuff
to
make
sure
that
i
was
satisfied
with
the
goods
she
sent
me
and
this
suggests
a
reason
for
the
large
percentage
of
killings
prosecuted
by
my
friend
namely
that
nott
being
the
most
astute
prosecutor
available
the
district
attorney
whenever
the
latter
had
a
particularly
atrocious
case
sent
it
to
him
in
order
that
the
defendant
might
surely
get
his
full
deserts
the
reasons
for
these
homicides
were
of
every
sort
police
officers
and
citizens
were
shot
and
killed
by
criminals
trying
to
make
and
by
negroes
and
others
running
amuck
despondent
young
men
shot
their
unresponsive
sweethearts
and
then
either
blew
out
their
own
brains
of
pretended
to
try
to
do
so
two
had
a
duel
with
revolvers
and
each
killed
the
other
several
men
were
shot
for
being
too
attentive
to
young
women
residing
in
the
same
hotels
an
italian
whose
wife
had
left
him
and
gone
to
her

killed
her

sister
her
sister

his
two
children
and
finally
himself
the
gopher
gang
started
a
riot
at
a
benefit
dance
given
to
a
widow
and
killed
a
man
after
which
they
fled
to
the
woods
and
fired
from
cover
upon
the
police
until
eighteen
were
overpowered
and
arrested
a
young
girl
and
her
fiance
sitting
in
the
parlor
planning
their
honeymoon
were
unexpectedly
interrupted
by
a
rejected
suitor
of
the
girl
who
shot
and
killed
both
of
them
an
italian
who
peeked
into
a
bedroom
just
for
fun
afterward
rushed
in
and
cut
off
two
heads
with
an
ax
one
of
them
was

a

and
a

of
dozen
people
were
incidentally
shot
stabbed
or
otherwise
disposed
of
in
the
course
of
quarrels
over
the
most
trivial
matters
in
almost
no
case
was
there
what
an
intelligent
civilized
man
would
regard
as
an
adequate
reason
for
the
homicide
they
killed
because
they
felt
like
killing
and
yielded
to
the
impulse
whatever
its
immediate
origin
this
conclusion
is
abundantly
supported
by
the
figures
of
the
tribune
for
the
seven
years
ending
in
when
carefully
analyzed
during
this
period
homicides
were
recorded
of
these
there
were
of
which
the
causes
were
unknown
and
committed
while
making
a
justifiable
arrest
in
or
by
the
insane
so
that
there
were
in
fact
only
felonious
homicides
the
causes
of
which
can
be
definitely
alleged
the
ratio
of
the
quarrels
to
this
net
total
is
about
per
cent
there
were
in
addition
homicides
due
to
liquor
that
is
without
cause
thus
eighty
per
cent
of
all
the
murders
and
manslaughters
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
seven
years
were
for
no
reason
at
all
or
from
mere
anger
or
habit
arising
out
of
causes
often
of
the
most
trifling
character
nor
are
the
conclusions
changed
by
the
figures
of
the
years
between
and
during
this
period
homicides
were
recorded
of
these
there
were
of
which
the
causes
were
not
known
and
committed
while
making
a
justifiable
arrest
in
or
by
the
insane
leaving
cases
of
felonious
homicides
of
known
causes
of
these
homicides
were
due
to
quarrels
and
to
liquor
a
total
of
out
of
the
cases
of
known
causes
being
traceable
in
this
another
seven
years
to
motives
the
most
casual
it
would
be
stupid
to
allege
that
the
reason
men
killed
was
because
they
had
been
stepped
on
or
had
been
deprived
of
a
glass
of
beer
the
cause
lies
deeper
than
that
it
rests
in
the
willingness
or
desire
of
the
murderer
to
kill
at
all
among
barbaric
or
savage
peoples
this
is
natural
but
among
civilized
nations
it
is
hardly
to
be
anticipated
if
the
negro
who
shoots
his
fellow
because
he
believes
himself
to
have
been
cheated
out
of
ten
cents
were
really
civilized
he
would
either
not
have
the
impulse
to
kill
or
having
the
impulse
to
kill
would
have
sufficient
power
of
to
refrain
from
doing
so
this
power
of
may
be
natural
or
acquired
and
it
may
or
may
not
be
possessed
by
the
man
who
feels
a
desire
to
commit
a
homicide
the
fact
to
be
observed
the
interesting
and
broadly
speaking
the
astonishing
fact
is
that
among
a
people
like
ourselves
anybody
should
have
a
desire
to
kill
it
is
even
more
astonishing
than
that
the
impulse
should
be
yielded
to
so
often
if
it
comes
this
then
is
the
real
reason
why
men
kill
because
it
is
inherent
in
their
state
of
mind
it
is
part
of
their
mental
and
physical
they
are
ready
to
kill
they
want
to
kill
they
are
the
kind
of
men
who
do
kill
this
is
the
result
of
their
heredity
environment
educational
and
religious
training
or
the
absence
of
it
how
many
readers
of
this
paper
have
ever
experienced
an
actual
desire
to
kill
another
human
being
probably
not
one
hundredth
of
one
per
cent
they
belong
to
the
class
of
people
who
either
never
have
such
an
impulse
or
at
any
rate
have
been
taught
to
keep
such
impulses
under
control
hence
it
is
futile
to
try
to
explain
that
some
men
kill
for
a
trifling
sum
of
money
some
because
they
feel
insulted
others
because
of
political
or
labor
disputes
or
because
they
do
not
like
their
food
any
one
of
these
may
be
the
match
that
sets
off
the
gunpowder
but
the
real
cause
of
the
killing
is
the
fact
that
the
gunpowder
is
there
lying
around
loose
and
ready
to
be
touched
off
what
engenders
this
gunpowder
state
of
mind
would
make
a
valuable
sociological
study
but
it
may
well
be
that
a
seemingly
inconsequential
fact
may
so
embitter
a
boy
or
man
toward
life
or
the
human
race
in
general
that
in
time
he
sees
red
and
goes
through
the
world
looking
for
trouble
any
cause
that
makes
for
crime
and
depravity
makes
for
murder
as
well
the
little
boy
who
is
driven
out
of
the
tenement
onto
the
street
and
in
turn
off
the
street
by
a
policeman
until
finding
no
wholesome
place
to
play
he
joins
a
gang
and
begins
an
incipient
career
of
crime
may
end
in
the
death
house
the
table
on
the
opposite
page
gives
the
figures
collected
by
the
tribune
for
the
years
from
to
in
view
of
the
foregoing
it
may
seem
paradoxical
for
the
writer
to
state
that
he
questions
the
alleged
unusual
tendency
to
commit
murder
on
the
part
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
yet
of
one
fact
he
is
absolutely
convinced
namely
that
homicide
has
substantially
decreased
in
the
last
fifteen
years
even
according
to
the
figures
collected
by
the
tribune
there
were
but
homicides
in
as
compared
with
in
and
in
meantime
the
population
of
our
country
has
been
leaping
onward
number
of
murders
and
homicides
in
the
united
states
each
year
since
compared
with
the
population
number
of
number
of
murders
and
estimated

and

homicides
in
population
homicides
the
united
of
the
for
each
states
united
states
million
of
people
total
we
are
enough
god
knows
without
making
things
out
any
worse
than
they
are
our
murder
rate
per
unquestionably
exceeds
that
of
most
of
the
countries
of
western
europe
but
as
the
saying
is
there
a
reason
if
our
homicide
statistics
related
only
to
the
white
population
of
even
the
second
generation
born
in
this
country
we
should
find
i
am
convinced
that
we
are
no
more
homicidal
than
france
and
belgium
and
less
so
than
italy
it
is
to
be
expected
that
with
our
chinese
greaser
and
population
in
the
west
our
black
belt
in
the
south
and
our
sicilian
and
south
italian
immigration
in
the
north
and
east
our
murder
rate
should
exceed
those
of
the
continental
nations
which
are
nothing
if
not
well
policed
but
of
one
thing
we
can
be
abundantly
certain
without
any
figures
at
all
and
that
is
that
our
present
method
of
administering
justice
less
the
actions
of
juries
than
of
judges
the
system
taken
as
a
whole
offers
no
deterrent
to
the
embryonic
or
professional
criminal
the
administration
of
justice
is
not
the
swift
judgment
of
honest
men
upon
a
criminal
act
but
a
clever
game
between
judge
and
lawyer
in
which
the
action
of
the
jury
is
discounted
entirely
and
the
moves
are
made
with
a
view
to
checkmating
justice
not
in
the
trial
courtroom
but
before
the
appellate
tribunal
two
or
three
years
later
my
young
feller
said
a
grizzled
veteran
of
the
criminal
bar
to
me
long
years
ago
after
our
jury
had
gone
out
there
lots
of
things
in
this
game
you
ai
got
on
to
yet
do
you
think
i
care
what
this
jury
does
not
one
mite
i
got
a
nice
little
error
into
the
case
the
very
first
day
and
i
set
back
ever
since
we
are
convicted
get
jim
here
the
prisoner
out
on
a
certificate
and
it
be
two
years
before
the
court
of
appeals
will
get
around
to
the
case
meantime
jim
be
out
makin
money
to
pay
me
my
fee
wo
you
jim
then
your
witnesses
will
be
gone
and
nobody
remember
what
on
earth
it
all
about
you
be
down
in
wall
street
practicing
real
law
yourself
and
the
indictment
will
kick
around
the
office
for
a
year
or
so
all
covered
with
dust
and
then
some
day
i
get
a
friend
of
mine
to
come
in
quietly
and
move
to
dismiss
and
it
be
dismissed
do
you
worry
why
a
thousand
other
murders
will
have
been
committed
in
this
county
by
the
time
that
happens
bless
your
soul
you
ca
go
on
tryin
the
same
man
forever
give
the
other
fellers
a
chance
you
shake
your
head
well
it
a
fact
i
been
doin
it
for
forty
years
you
see
and
i
did
that
may
not
be
why
men
kill
but
perhaps
indirectly
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
chapter
detectives
and
others
a
detective
according
to
the
dictionaries
is
one
whose
occupation
it
is
to
discover
matters
as
to
which
information
is
desired
particularly
and
to
obtain
evidence
to
be
used
against
them
a
private
detective
by
the
same
authority
is
one
engaged
unofficially
in
obtaining
secret
information
for
or
guarding
the
private
interests
of
those
who
employ
him
the
definition
emphasizes
the
official
character
of
detectives
in
general
as
contrasted
with
those
whose
services
may
be
enlisted
for
hire
by
the
individual
citizen
but
the
distinction
is
of
little
importance
since
it
is
based
arbitrarily
upon
the
character
of
the
employer
whether
the
state
or
a
private
client
instead
of
upon
the
nature
of
the
employment
itself
which
is
the
only
thing
which
is
likely
to
interest
us
about
detectives
at
all
the
sanctified
tradition
that
a
detective
was
an
agile
person
with
a
variety
of
no
longer
obtains
even
in
light
literature
and
the
most
imaginative
of
us
is
frankly
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
detective
is
just
a
common
man
earning
or
pretending
to
earn
a
common
living
by
common
and
obvious
means
yet
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
are
accustomed
to
attribute
superhuman
acuteness
and
a
rapidity
of
intellect
to
this
vague
and
romantic
class
of
the
ordinary
work
of
a
detective
however
requires
neither
of
these
qualities
honesty
and
obedience
are
his
chief
requirements
and
if
he
have
intelligence
as
well
so
much
the
better
provided
it
be
of
the
variety
known
as
horse
sense
a
genuine
candidate
for
the
job
of
sherlock
holmes
would
find
little
competition
in
the
first
place
the
usual
work
of
a
detective
does
not
demand
any
extraordinary
powers
of
deduction
at
all
leaving
out
of
consideration
those
who
are
merely
private
policemen
often
in
uniform
and
principally
engaged
in
patrolling
residential
streets
preserving
order
at
fairs
and
political
meetings
or
in
breaking
strikes
and
preventing
riots
the
largest
part
of
the
work
for
which
detectives
are
employed
is
not
in
the
detection
of
crime
and
criminals
but
in
simply
watching
people
following
them
and
reporting
as
accurately
as
possible
their
movements
these
functions
are
known
in
the
vernacular
as
spotting
locating
and
trailing
it
requires
patience
some
powers
of
observation
and
occasionally
a
little
ingenuity
the
real
detective
under
such
circumstances
is
the
man
to
whom
they
hand
in
their
reports
yet
much
of
the
most
dramatic
and
valuable
work
that
is
done
involves
no
acuteness
at
all
but
simply
a
willingness
to
act
as
a
spy
and
to
brave
the
dangers
of
being
found
out
there
is
nothing
more
thrilling
in
the
pages
of
modern
history
than
the
story
of
the
man
james
mcpartland
who
uncovered
the
conspiracies
of
the
molly
mcguires
but
the
work
of
this
man
was
that
of
a
spy
pure
and
simple
another
highly
specialized
class
of
detectives
is
that
engaged
in
police
and
banking
work
who
by
experience
or
even
origin
have
a
wide
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
criminals
of
various
sorts
and
by
their
familiarity
with
the
latters
whereabouts
associates
work
and
methods
are
able
to
recognize
and
run
down
the
perpetrators
of
particular
crimes
thus
for
example
there
are
men
in
the
detective
bureau
of
new
york
city
who
know
by
name
and
perhaps
have
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
a
large
number
of
the
and
burglars
of
the
east
side
they
know
their
haunts
and
their
ties
of
friendship
or
marriage
when
any
particular
job
is
pulled
off
they
have
a
pretty
shrewd
idea
of
who
is
responsible
for
it
and
lay
their
plans
accordingly
if
necessary
they
run
in
the
whole
gang
and
put
each
of
them
through
a
course
of
interrogation
accusation
and
browbeating
until
some
one
breaks
down
or
makes
a
slip
that
involves
him
in
a
tangle
these
men
are
special
policemen
whose
knowledge
makes
them
detectives
by
courtesy
but
their
work
does
not
involve
any
particular
superiority
or
quickness
of
intellect
the
quality
which
we
are
wont
to
associate
with
the
detection
of
crime
now
if
the
ordinary
householder
finds
that
his
wife
necklace
has
mysteriously
disappeared
his
first
impulse
is
to
send
for
a
detective
of
some
sort
or
other
in
general
he
might
just
as
well
send
for
his
of
course
the
police
can
and
will
watch
the
pawnshops
for
the
missing
baubles
but
no
crook
who
is
not
a
fool
is
going
to
pawn
a
whole
necklace
on
the
bowery
the
very
next
day
after
it
has
been
lifted
or
he
can
enlist
a
private
detective
who
will
question
the
servants
and
perhaps
go
through
their
trunks
if
they
will
let
him
either
sort
will
probably
line
up
the
inmates
of
the
house
for
general
scrutiny
and
try
to
bully
them
separately
into
a
confession
this
may
save
the
master
a
disagreeable
experience
but
it
is
the
simplest
sort
of
police
work
and
is
done
vicariously
for
the
taxpayer
just
as
the
public
garbage
man
relieves
you
from
the
burden
of
taking
out
the
ashes
yourself
because
he
is
paid
for
it
not
on
account
of
your
own
incapacity
or
his
superiority
the
real
detective
is
the
one
who
taking
up
the
solution
of
a
crime
or
other
mystery
brings
to
bear
upon
it
unusual
powers
of
observation
and
deduction
and
an
exceptional
resourcefulness
in
acting
upon
his
conclusions
frankly
i
have
known
very
few
such
although
for
some
ten
years
i
have
made
use
of
a
large
number
of
detectives
in
both
public
and
private
matters
as
i
recall
the
long
line
of
cases
where
these
men
have
rendered
service
of
great
value
almost
every
one
resolves
itself
into
a
successful
piece
of
mere
spying
or
trailing
little
ingenuity
or
powers
of
reason
were
required
of
course
there
are
a
thousand
tricks
that
an
experienced
man
acquires
as
a
matter
of
course
but
which
at
first
sight
seem
almost
like
inspiration
i
shall
not
forget
my
delight
when
jesse
blocher
who
had
been
trailing
charles
foster
dodge
through
the
south
when
the
latter
was
wanted
as
the
chief
witness
against
abe
hummel
on
the
charge
of
subornation
of
perjury
of
which
he
was
finally
convicted
told
me
how
he
instantly
located
his
man
without
disclosing
his
own
identity
by
unostentatiously
leaving
a
note
addressed
to
dodge
in
a
envelope
upon
the
office
counter
of
the
hotel
charles
in
new
orleans
where
he
knew
his
quarry
to
be
staying
a
few
moments
later
the
clerk
saw
it
picked
it
up
and
as
a
matter
of
course
thrust
it
promptly
into
box
no
thus
involuntarily
hanging
as
it
were
a
red
lantern
on
dodge
door
there
is
no
more
reason
to
look
for
superiority
of
intelligence
or
mental
alertness
among
detectives
of
the
ordinary
class
than
there
is
to
expect
it
from
clerks
stationary
engineers
plumbers
or
firemen
while
comparisons
are
invidious
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
that
the
ordinary
chauffeur
was
probably
a
brighter
man
than
the
average
detective
this
is
not
to
be
taken
in
derogation
of
the
latter
but
as
a
compliment
to
the
former
there
are
a
great
many
detectives
of
ambiguous
training
i
remember
in
one
case
discovering
that
of
the
more
important
detectives
employed
by
a
private
society
in
new
york
one
had
been
a
street
vender
of
frankfurters
otherwise
yclept
hot
dogs
and
another
the
keeper
of
a
bird
store
which
last
perhaps
qualified
him
for
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
human
game
there
is
a
popular
fiction
that
lawyers
are
shrewd
and
capable
similar
to
the
prevailing
one
that
detectives
are
astute
and
cunning
but
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
biggest
agencies
in
the
country
remarked
to
me
the
other
day
when
discussing
the
desirability
of
retaining
local
counsel
in
a
distant
city
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
find
a
lawyer
that
is
a
dead
one
i
feel
confident
that
he
did
not
mean
this
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
good
lawyer
except
a
dead
lawyer
what
my
detective
friend
probably
had
in
mind
was
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
lawyer
who
brought
to
bear
on
a
new
problem
any
originality
of
thought
or
action
it
is
even
harder
to
find
a
detective
who
is
not
in
this
sense
a
dead
one
i
have
the
feeling
being
a
lawyer
myself
that
it
is
harder
to
find
a
live
detective
than
a
live
lawyer
there
are
a
few
of
both
however
if
you
know
where
to
look
for
them
but
it
is
easy
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
the
fundamental
reason
why
it
is
so
hard
to
form
any
just
opinion
of
detectives
in
general
is
that
except
by
their
fruits
there
is
little
opportunity
to
discriminate
between
the
able
and
the
incapable
now
the
more
difficult
and
complicated
his
task
the
less
likely
is
the
sleuth
honest
or
otherwise
to
succeed
the
chances
are
a
good
deal
more
than
even
that
he
will
never
solve
the
mystery
for
which
he
is
engaged
thus
at
the
end
of
three
months
you
will
have
only
his
reports
and
his
bill
which
are
poor
comfort
to
say
the
least
and
yet
he
may
have
really
worked
eighteen
hours
a
day
in
your
service
but
a
dishonest
detective
has
only
to
disappear
and
take
his
ease
for
the
same
period
and
send
you
his
reports
and
his
bill
and
you
will
have
only
his
word
for
how
much
work
he
has
done
and
how
much
money
he
has
spent
you
are
absolutely
in
his
power
unless
you
hire
another
detective
to
watch
him
consequently
there
is
no
class
in
the
world
where
the
temptation
to
dishonesty
is
greater
than
among
detectives
this
too
is
i
fancy
the
reason
that
the
evidence
of
the
police
detective
is
received
with
so
much
suspicion
by
jurymen
they
know
that
the
only
way
for
him
to
retain
his
position
is
by
making
a
record
and
getting
convictions
and
hence
they
are
always
looking
for
jobs
and
if
a
police
detective
does
make
arrests
and
send
a
man
to
jail
every
once
in
a
while
there
is
no
conclusive
way
for
his
superiors
to
be
sure
he
is
loafing
there
are
a
very
large
number
of
persons
who
go
into
the
detective
business
for
the
same
reason
that
others
enter
the
ministry
they
make
a
living
at
anything
else
provided
he
has
squint
eyes
and
a
dark
complexion
almost
anybody
feels
that
he
is
qualified
to
unravel
the
tangled
threads
of
crime
the
first
resource
of
the
superannuated
or
discharged
police
detective
is
to
start
an
agency
of
course
he
may
be
first
class
in
spite
of
these
disqualifications
but
the
presumption
in
the
first
instance
is
that
he
is
no
longer
alert
or
effective
and
in
the
second
that
in
one
way
or
another
he
is
not
honest
agencies
recruited
from
deposed
and
other
usually
have
all
the
faults
of
the
police
without
any
of
their
virtues
there
are
many
small
agencies
which
do
reliable
work
and
there
are
a
number
of
private
detectives
in
all
the
big
cities
who
work
and
achieve
excellent
results
however
if
he
expects
to
accomplish
anything
by
hiring
detectives
the
layman
or
lawyer
must
first
make
sure
of
his
agency
or
his
man
one
other
feature
of
the
detective
business
should
not
be
overlooked
in
addition
to
charging
for
services
not
actually
rendered
and
expenses
not
actually
incurred
there
is
in
many
cases
a
strong
temptation
to
betray
the
interests
of
the
employer
a
private
detective
may
and
usually
does
become
possessed
of
information
even
more
valuable
to
the
person
who
is
being
watched
than
to
the
person
to
whom
he
owes
his
allegiance
unreliable
rascals
constantly
sell
out
to
the
other
side
and
play
both
ends
against
the
middle
in
this
they
resemble
some
of
the
famous
diplomatic
agents
of
history
and
police
detectives
employed
to
run
down
criminals
and
protect
society
have
been
known
instead
to
act
as
stalls
for
bank
burglars
and
for
a
consideration
to
assist
them
to
dispose
of
their
booty
and
protect
them
from
arrest
and
capture
it
has
repeatedly
happened
that
reliable
private
detectives
have
discovered
that
the
police
employed
upon
the
same
case
have
in
reality
been
tipping
off
the
criminals
as
to
what
was
being
done
and
coaching
them
as
to
their
conduct
of
course
the
natural
jealousy
existing
between
official
and
unofficial
agents
of
the
law
leads
to
many
unfounded
accusations
of
this
character
but
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
much
of
the
most
effective
police
work
is
done
by
employing
professional
criminals
to
secure
information
and
act
as
often
results
in
a
definite
understanding
that
the
latter
shall
be
themselves
protected
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
labors
the
relations
of
the
regular
police
to
crime
however
and
the
general
subject
of
police
graft
have
little
place
in
a
chapter
of
this
character
the
first
question
that
usually
arises
is
whether
a
detective
shall
or
shall
not
be
employed
at
all
in
any
particular
case
usually
the
most
important
thing
is
to
find
out
what
the
real
character
past
and
associations
of
some
particular
individual
may
be
detective
agencies
with
offices
throughout
the
country
are
naturally
in
a
better
position
to
acquire
such
information
quickly
than
the
private
individual
or
lawyer
since
they
are
on
the
spot
and
have
an
organized
staff
containing
the
right
sort
of
men
for
the
work
if
the
information
lies
in
your
own
city
you
can
probably
hire
some
one
to
get
it
or
ferret
it
out
yourself
quite
as
well
and
much
more
cheaply
than
by
employing
their
services
the
leads
are
few
and
generally
simple
the
past
employers
and
business
associates
his
landlords
and
landladies
his
friends
and
enemies
and
his
milkman
must
be
run
down
and
interrogated
perhaps
his
personal
movements
must
be
watched
any
intelligent
fellow
who
is
out
of
a
job
will
do
this
for
you
for
about
a
day
and
expenses
the
agencies
usually
charge
from
to
and
up
and
prefer
two
men
to
one
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
to
make
sure
that
the
subject
is
fully
covered
if
the
suspect
is
on
the
move
and
trains
or
steamships
must
be
met
you
have
practically
no
choice
but
to
employ
a
national
agency
it
alone
has
the
proper
plant
and
equipment
for
the
work
in
an
emergency
organization
counts
more
than
anything
else
where
time
is
of
the
essence
the
individual
has
no
opportunity
to
hire
his
own
men
or
start
an
organization
of
his
own
but
if
the
matter
is
one
where
there
is
plenty
of
leisure
to
act
you
can
usually
do
your
own
detective
work
better
and
cheaper
than
any
one
else
regarding
the
work
of
the
detective
as
a
spy
which
probably
constitutes
per
cent
of
his
employment
few
persons
realize
how
widely
such
services
are
being
utilized
the
insignificant
old
irishwoman
who
stumbles
against
you
in
the
department
store
is
possibly
watching
with
her
cloudy
but
eagle
eye
for
shoplifters
the
man
on
the
may
in
fact
be
a
professional
spotter
the
stout
youth
with
the
pince
nez
who
is
examining
the
wedding
presents
is
perhaps
a
man
all
this
you
know
or
may
suspect
but
you
are
not
so
likely
to
be
aware
that
the
himself
is
the
agent
of
a
rival
concern
placed
in
the
department
store
to
keep
track
not
only
of
prices
but
of
whether
or
not
the
wholesalers
are
living
up
to
their
agreements
in
regard
to
the
furnishing
of
particular
kinds
of
goods
only
to
one
house
or
that
the
conductor
on
the
car
is
a
paid
detective
of
the
company
whose
principal
duty
is
not
to
collect
fares
but
to
report
the
doings
of
the
unions
or
that
the
gentleman
who
is
accidentally
introduced
to
you
at
the
wedding
breakfast
is
employed
by
a
board
of
directors
to
get
a
line
on
your
business
associates
and
social
companions
in
the
great
struggle
between
capital
and
labor
each
side
has
expended
large
sums
of
money
in
employing
confederates
to
secure
secret
information
as
to
the
plans
and
doings
of
the
enemy
almost
every
labor
union
has
its
judas
and
less
often
a
secretary
to
a
capitalist
is
in
the
secret
employment
of
a
labor
union
the
railroads
must
be
kept
informed
of
what
is
going
on
and
if
necessary
they
import
a
man
from
another
part
of
the
country
to
join
the
local
organization
often
such
men
on
account
of
their
force
and
intelligence
are
elected
to
high
office
in
the
brotherhoods
whose
secrets
they
are
hired
to
betray
practically
every
big
manufacturing
plant
in
the
united
states
has
on
its
payrolls
men
acting
as
engineers
foremen
or
laborers
who
are
drawing
from
to
per
month
as
detectives
either
to
keep
their
employers
informed
as
to
the
workings
of
the
labor
unions
to
report
to
the
directors
the
actual
conduct
of
the
business
by
its
salaried
officers
superintendents
and
overseers
or
to
ascertain
and
report
to
outside
competing
concerns
the
methods
and
processes
made
use
of
the
materials
utilized
and
the
exact
cost
of
production
there
are
detectives
among
the
chambermaids
and
bellboys
in
the
hotels
and
also
among
the
guests
there
are
detectives
on
the
passenger
lists
and
in
the
cardrooms
of
the
atlantic
liners
the
colored
porter
on
the
private
car
the
butler
at
your
friend
house
the
chorus
girl
on
broadway
the
clerk
in
the
law
office
the
employee
in
the
commercial
agency
may
all
be
drawing
pay
in
the
interest
of
some
one
else
who
may
be
either
a
transportation
company
a
a
rival
financier
a
yellow
newspaper
an
injured
or
even
an
erring
wife
a
grievance
committee
or
a
competing
concern
and
the
duties
of
these
persons
may
and
will
range
from
the
theft
of
mailing
lists
books
papers
and
private
letters
up
to
genuine
detective
work
requiring
some
real
ability
detective
work
of
the
sort
which
involves
the
betrayal
of
confidences
and
friendships
naturally
excites
our
aversion
yet
in
many
cases
the
end
undoubtedly
justifies
the
means
employed
and
often
there
is
no
other
way
to
avert
disaster
and
prevent
fiendish
crimes
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
the
information
sought
is
purely
for
mercenary
or
even
less
worthy
reasons
and
those
engaged
in
these
undertakings
range
from
rascals
of
the
lowest
type
to
men
who
are
ready
to
risk
death
for
the
cause
which
they
represent
and
who
are
really
heroes
of
a
high
order
one
of
the
latter
with
whom
i
happened
to
be
thrown
professionally
was
a
young
fellow
of
about
twenty
named
guthrie
it
was
during
a
great
strike
and
outrages
were
being
committed
all
over
the
city
of
new
york
by
dynamiters
supposed
to
be
in
the
employ
of
the
unions
young
guthrie
who
was
a
reckless
daredevil
offered
his
services
to
the
employers
and
agreed
to
join
one
of
the
local
unions
and
try
to
find
out
who
were
the
men
blowing
up
office
buildings
in
process
of
construction
and
otherwise
terrorizing
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
accordingly
he
applied
for
membership
in
the
organization
and
by
giving
evidence
of
his
courage
and
fiber
managed
to
secure
a
place
as
a
volunteer
in
the
dynamiting
squad
so
cleverly
did
he
pass
himself
off
as
a
bitter
enemy
of
capital
that
he
was
entrusted
with
secrets
of
the
utmost
value
and
took
part
in
making
the
plans
and
procuring
the
dynamite
to
execute
them
the
quality
of
his
nerve
as
well
as
his
foolhardiness
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
once
carried
a
case
full
of
the
explosive
around
the
city
jumping
on
and
off
street
cars
and
dodging
vehicles
when
the
proper
moment
came
and
the
dynamite
had
been
placed
in
an
uncompleted
building
on
street
guthrie
gave
the
signal
and
the
police
arrested
the
dynamiters
all
of
them
including
guthrie
who
was
placed
with
the
rest
in
a
cell
in
the
tombs
and
continued
to
report
to
the
district
attorney
all
the
information
which
he
thus
secured
from
his
unsuspecting
associates
indeed
it
was
hard
to
convince
the
authorities
that
guthrie
was
a
spy
and
not
a
mere
accomplice
who
had
turned
state
evidence
a
distinction
of
legal
significance
so
far
as
his
evidence
was
concerned
the
final
episode
in
the
drama
was
the
unearthing
by
the
police
of
hoboken
of
the
secret
cache
of
the
dynamiters
containing
a
large
quantity
of
the
explosive
guthrie
instructions
as
to
how
they
should
find
it
read
like
a
page
from
poe
gold
bug
you
had
to
go
at
night
to
a
place
where
a
lonely
road
crossed
the
erie
railroad
tracks
in
the
hackensack
meadows
and
mark
the
spot
where
the
shadow
of
a
telegraph
pole
cast
by
an
arc
light
fell
on
a
stone
wall
this
you
must
climb
and
walk
so
many
paces
north
turn
and
go
so
many
feet
west
and
then
north
again
you
then
came
to
a
white
stone
from
which
you
laid
your
course
through
more
latitude
and
longitude
until
you
were
right
over
the
spot
the
police
of
hoboken
did
as
directed
and
after
tacking
round
and
round
the
field
found
the
dynamite
of
course
the
union
said
the
whole
thing
was
a
plant
and
that
guthrie
had
put
the
dynamite
in
the
field
himself
at
the
instigation
of
his
employers
but
before
the
case
came
to
trial
both
dynamiters
pleaded
guilty
and
went
to
sing
sing
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
an
a
burglar
i
often
wonder
where
guthrie
is
now
he
certainly
cared
little
for
his
life
perhaps
he
is
down
in
venezuela
or
mexico
he
could
never
be
aught
than
a
soldier
of
fortune
but
for
a
long
time
the
employers
thought
that
guthrie
was
a
detective
sent
by
the
unions
to
compromise
them
in
the
very
dynamiting
they
were
trying
to
stop
i
once
had
a
particularly
dangerous
and
unfortunate
case
where
a
private
client
was
being
blackmailed
by
a
ruffian
who
had
never
seen
him
but
had
selected
him
arbitrarily
as
a
person
likely
to
give
up
money
the
blackmailer
was
a
german
socialist
who
was
out
of
employment
a
man
of
desperate
character
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
world
owed
him
a
living
and
he
had
decided
that
the
easiest
way
to
get
it
was
to
make
some
more
prosperous
person
give
him
a
thousand
dollars
under
threat
of
being
exposed
as
an
enemy
of
society
the
charge
was
so
absurd
as
to
be
almost
ludicrous
but
had
my
client
caused
the
blackmailer
arrest
the
matter
would
have
been
the
subject
of
endless
newspaper
notoriety
and
comment
it
was
therefore
thought
wise
to
make
use
of
other
means
and
i
procured
the
assistance
of
a
young
of
my
acquaintance
who
in
the
guise
of
a
vaudeville
artist
seeking
a
job
went
to
the
and
pretended
to
be
looking
for
an
actor
friend
with
a
name
not
unlike
that
of
the
criminal
after
two
or
three
visits
he
managed
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
the
blackmailer
and
thereafter
spent
much
time
with
him
both
were
out
of
work
both
were
german
and
both
liked
beer
my
friend
had
just
enough
money
to
satisfy
this
latter
craving
in
a
month
or
so
they
were
intimate
friends
and
used
to
go
fishing
together
down
the
bay
at
last
after
many
months
the
criminal
disclosed
to
the
detective
his
plan
of
blackmailing
my
client
and
suggested
that
as
two
heads
were
better
than
one
they
had
better
make
it
a
joint
venture
the
detective
pretended
to
balk
at
the
idea
at
first
but
was
finally
persuaded
and
at
the
request
undertook
the
delivery
of
the
blackmailing
letters
to
my
client
inside
of
three
weeks
he
had
in
his
possession
enough
evidence
in
the
criminal
own
handwriting
to
send
him
to
a
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life
when
at
last
the
detective
disclosed
his
identity
the
blackmailer
at
first
refused
to
believe
him
and
then
literally
rolled
on
the
floor
in
his
agony
and
fear
at
discovering
how
he
had
been
hoodwinked
the
next
day
he
disappeared
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
but
his
letters
are
in
my
vault
ready
to
be
used
if
he
again
puts
in
an
appearance
the
records
of
the
police
and
of
the
private
agencies
contain
many
instances
where
murderers
have
confessed
their
guilt
long
after
the
crime
to
supposed
friends
who
were
in
reality
decoys
placed
there
for
that
very
purpose
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
criminals
that
they
can
not
keep
their
secrets
locked
in
their
own
breasts
the
impulse
to
confession
is
universal
particularly
in
women
egotism
has
some
part
in
this
but
the
chief
element
is
the
desire
for
companionship
criminals
have
a
horror
of
dying
under
an
alias
the
dignity
of
identity
appeals
even
to
the
tramp
this
impulse
leads
oftentimes
to
the
most
unnecessary
and
suicidal
disclosures
the
murderer
who
has
planned
and
executed
a
diabolical
homicide
and
who
has
retired
to
obscurity
and
safety
will
very
likely
in
course
of
time
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
some
one
whom
he
believes
to
be
his
friend
he
wants
to
get
it
off
his
chest
to
talk
it
over
to
discuss
its
fine
points
to
boast
of
how
clever
he
was
to
ask
for
unnecessary
advice
about
his
conduct
in
the
future
to
have
at
least
one
other
person
in
the
world
who
has
seen
his
nakedness
the
interesting
feature
of
such
confessions
from
a
legal
point
of
view
is
that
no
matter
how
circumstantial
they
may
be
they
are
not
usually
of
themselves
sufficient
under
our
law
to
warrant
a
conviction
the
admission
or
confession
of
a
defendant
needs
legal
corroboration
this
corroboration
is
often
very
difficult
to
find
and
frequently
can
not
be
secured
at
all
this
provision
of
the
statutes
is
doubtless
a
wise
one
to
prevent
hysterical
suicidal
egotistical
and
persons
from
meeting
death
in
the
electric
chair
or
on
the
gallows
but
it
often
results
in
the
guilty
going
unpunished
personally
i
have
never
known
a
criminal
to
confess
a
crime
of
which
he
was
innocent
the
nearest
thing
to
it
in
my
experience
is
when
one
criminal
jointly
guilty
with
another
and
sure
of
conviction
has
drawn
lots
with
his
pal
lost
confessed
and
in
the
confession
exculpated
his
companion
in
the
police
organization
of
almost
every
large
city
there
are
a
few
men
who
are
genuinely
gifted
for
the
work
of
detection
such
an
one
was
guiseppe
petrosino
a
great
detective
and
an
honest
unselfish
and
heroic
man
who
united
indefatigable
patience
and
industry
with
reasoning
powers
of
a
high
order
the
most
thrilling
evening
of
my
life
was
when
i
listened
before
a
crackling
fire
in
my
library
to
story
of
the
van
cortlandt
park
murder
the
night
before
i
was
going
to
prosecute
the
case
sitting
stiffly
in
an
his
ugly
expressionless
save
for
an
occasional
flash
from
his
black
eyes
petrosino
recounted
slowly
and
accurately
how
by
means
of
a
single
slip
of
paper
bearing
the
penciled
name
sabbatto
gizzi
box
lambertville
he
had
run
down
the
unknown
murderer
of
an
unknown
italian
stabbed
to
death
in
the
park
shrubbery
petrosino
physical
characteristics
were
so
pronounced
that
he
was
probably
as
widely
if
not
more
widely
known
than
any
other
italian
in
new
york
he
was
short
and
heavy
with
enormous
shoulders
and
a
bull
neck
on
which
was
placed
a
great
round
head
like
a
summer
squash
his
face
was
and
he
talked
with
a
deliberation
that
was
due
to
his
desire
for
accuracy
but
which
at
times
might
have
been
suspected
to
arise
from
some
other
cause
he
rarely
smiled
and
went
methodically
about
his
business
which
was
to
drive
the
italian
criminals
out
of
the
city
and
country
of
course
being
a
marked
man
in
more
senses
than
one
it
was
practically
impossible
to
disguise
himself
and
accordingly
he
had
to
rely
upon
his
own
investigations
and
detective
powers
supplemented
by
the
efforts
of
the
trained
men
in
the
italian
branch
many
of
whom
are
detectives
of
a
high
order
of
ability
if
the
life
of
petrosino
were
to
be
written
it
would
be
a
book
unique
in
the
history
of
criminology
and
crime
for
this
man
was
probably
the
only
great
detective
of
the
world
to
find
his
career
in
a
foreign
country
amid
criminals
of
his
own
race
i
have
instanced
petrosino
as
an
example
of
a
police
detective
of
a
very
unusual
type
but
i
have
known
several
other
men
on
the
new
york
police
force
of
real
genius
in
their
own
particular
lines
of
work
one
of
these
is
an
irishman
who
makes
a
specialty
of
men
oil
and
mining
stock
operators
and
their
kin
and
who
knows
the
antecedents
and
history
of
most
of
them
better
than
any
other
man
in
the
country
he
is
ready
to
take
the
part
of
either
a
sucker
or
a
fellow
crook
as
the
exigencies
of
the
case
may
demand
there
are
detectives
real
ones
on
the
police
force
of
all
the
great
cities
of
the
world
most
of
them
specialists
a
few
of
them
geniuses
capable
of
undertaking
the
ferreting
out
of
any
sort
of
mystery
but
the
last
are
rare
the
police
detective
usually
lacks
the
training
education
and
social
experience
to
make
him
effective
in
dealing
with
the
class
of
elite
criminals
who
make
high
society
their
field
yet
of
course
it
is
this
class
of
crooks
who
most
excite
our
interest
and
who
fill
the
pages
of
popular
detective
fiction
the
headquarters
man
has
no
time
nor
inclination
to
follow
the
sporting
duchess
and
the
fictitious
earl
who
accompanies
her
in
their
picturesque
wanderings
around
the
world
he
is
busy
inside
the
confines
of
his
own
country
parents
or
children
may
disappear
but
the
mere
seeking
of
oblivion
on
their
part
is
no
crime
and
does
not
concern
him
except
by
special
dispensation
on
the
part
of
his
superiors
divorced
couples
may
steal
their
own
children

interest
of
nations

parties
or

individuals
which
from
their
very
nature
are
outside
the
purview
of
the
regular
police
here
then
is
the
field
of
the
secret
agent
or
private
detective
and
here
forsooth
is
where
the
detective
of
genuine
deductive
powers
and
the
polished
address
of
the
man
of
the
world
is
required
there
are
two
classes
of
cases
where
a
private
detective
must
needs
be
used
if
indeed
any
professional
assistance
is
to
be
called
in
first
where
the
person
whose
identity
is
sought
to
be
discovered
or
whose
activities
are
sought
to
be
terminated
is
not
a
criminal
or
has
committed
no
crime
and
second
where
though
a
crime
has
been
committed
the
injured
parties
can
not
afford
to
undertake
a
public
prosecution
for
example
if
you
are
receiving
anonymous
letters
the
writer
of
which
accuses
you
of
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
things
you
would
of
course
much
prefer
to
find
out
who
it
is
and
stop
him
quietly
than
to
turn
over
the
correspondence
to
the
police
and
let
the
writer
attorneys
publicly
you
at
his
trial
as
to
your
past
career
even
if
a
diamond
necklace
is
stolen
from
a
family
living
on
fifth
avenue
there
is
more
than
an
even
chance
that
the
owner
will
prefer
to
conceal
her
loss
rather
than
to
have
her
picture
in
the
morning
paper
yet
she
will
wish
to
find
the
necklace
if
she
can
when
the
matter
has
no
criminal
side
at
all
the
police
can
not
be
availed
of
although
we
sometimes
read
that
the
officers
of
the
local
precinct
have
spent
many
hours
in
trying
to
locate
lost
pomeranian
or
in
performing
other
functions
of
an
essentially
private
nature
most
generously
but
if
for
example
your
daughter
is
made
the
recipient
almost
daily
of
anonymous
gifts
of
jewelry
which
arrive
by
mail
express
or
messenger
and
you
are
anxious
to
discover
the
identity
of
her
admirer
and
return
them
you
will
probably
wish
to
engage
outside
assistance
where
will
you
seek
it
you
can
do
one
of
two
things
go
to
a
big
agency
and
secure
the
services
of
the
right
man
or
engage
such
a
man
outside
who
may
or
may
not
be
a
professional
detective
i
have
frequently
utilized
with
success
in
peculiar
and
difficult
cases
the
services
of
men
whom
i
knew
to
be
persons
with
a
natural
taste
for
ferreting
out
mysteries
but
who
were
not
detectives
at
all
your
head
bookkeeper
may
have
real
talents
in
this
direction
if
he
is
not
above
using
them
naturally
the
first
essential
is
brains
and
if
you
can
give
the
time
to
the
matter
your
own
head
will
probably
be
the
best
one
for
your
purposes
if
then
you
are
willing
to
undertake
the
job
yourself
all
you
need
is
some
person
or
persons
to
carry
out
your
instructions
and
such
are
by
no
means
difficult
to
find
i
have
had
many
a
case
run
down
by
my
own
office
force
clerks
lawyers
and
stenographers
all
taking
a
turn
at
it
why
not
is
the
professional
sleuth
working
on
a
fixed
salary
for
a
regular
agency
and
doing
a
dozen
different
jobs
each
month
as
likely
to
bring
to
bear
upon
your
own
private
problem
as
much
intelligence
as
you
yourself
there
is
no
mystery
about
such
work
except
what
the
detective
himself
sees
fit
to
enshroud
it
with
most
of
us
do
detective
work
all
the
time
without
being
conscious
of
it
simply
because
the
matter
concerns
the
theft
of
a
pearl
or
the
betraying
of
a
business
or
professional
secret
or
the
disappearance
of
a
friend
the
opinion
of
a
stranger
becomes
no
more
valuable
and
the
chances
are
equal
that
the
stranger
will
make
a
bungle
of
it
many
of
the
best
available
detectives
are
men
who
work
by
themselves
without
any
permanent
staff
and
who
have
their
own
regular
clients
generally
law
firms
and
corporations
almost
any
attorney
knows
several
such
and
the
chief
advantage
of
employing
one
of
them
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
can
learn
just
what
their
abilities
are
by
personal
experience
they
usually
command
a
high
rate
of
remuneration
but
deductive
ability
and
resourcefulness
are
so
rare
that
they
are
at
a
premium
and
can
only
be
secured
by
paying
it
these
men
are
able
if
necessary
to
assume
the
character
of
a
doctor
traveller
or
business
agent
without
wearing
in
their
lapels
a
sign
that
they
are
detectives
and
they
will
reason
ahead
of
the
other
fellow
and
can
sometimes
calculate
pretty
closely
what
he
will
do
dollars
a
day
will
generally
hire
the
best
of
them
and
they
are
well
worth
it
the
detective
business
swarms
with
men
of
doubtful
honesty
and
morals
who
are
under
a
constant
temptation
to
charge
for
services
not
rendered
and
expenses
not
incurred
who
are
accustomed
to
exaggeration
if
not
to
perjury
and
who
have
neither
the
inclination
nor
the
ability
to
do
competent
work
once
they
get
their
clutches
on
a
wealthy
client
they
resemble
the
shyster
lawyer
in
their
efforts
to
bleed
him
by
stimulating
his
fears
of
publicity
and
by
holding
out
false
hopes
of
success
and
thus
prolonging
their
period
of
service
an
unscrupulous
detective
will
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
work
on
two
jobs
at
once
and
charge
all
his
time
to
each
client
he
will
constantly
report
progress
when
nothing
has
been
accomplished
and
his
expenses
will
fill
pages
of
his
notebook
meantime
his
daily
reports
will
fall
like
a
shower
of
autumn
leaves
in
no
profession
is
it
more
essential
to
know
the
man
who
is
working
for
you
if
you
need
a
detective
get
the
best
you
can
find
put
a
limit
on
the
expense
and
give
him
your
absolute
confidence
chapter
vi
detectives
who
detect
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
writer
discussed
at
some
length
the
real
as
distinguished
from
the
fancied
attributes
of
detectives
in
general
and
the
weaknesses
as
well
as
the
virtues
of
the
detective
agency
there
are
in
the
city
of
new
york
at
the
present
time
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
licensed
detectives
under
the
detective
license
laws
each
of
these
has
been
required
to
file
with
the
state
comptroller
written
evidences
of
his
competency
and
integrity
approved
by
five
reputable
freeholders
of
his
county
and
to
give
bond
in
the
sum
of
two
thousand
dollars
he
also
has
to
pay
a
license
fee
of
one
hundred
dollars
per
annum
but
this
enables
him
to
employ
as
many
operators
as
he
chooses
in
other
words
the
head
of
the
agency
may
be
of
good
character
and
his
agents
wholly
undesirable
citizens
how
often
this
is
the
case
is
known
to
none
better
than
the
heads
themselves
the
strength
and
efficiency
of
a
detective
agency
does
not
lie
in
the
name
at
the
top
of
its
but
in
the
unknown
personnel
of
the
men
who
are
doing
or
shirking
the
work
i
believe
that
most
of
the
principals
of
the
many
agencies
throughout
the
united
states
are
animated
by
a
serious
desire
to
give
their
clients
a
full
return
for
their
money
and
loyal
and
honest
service
but
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
can
not
make
up
for
the
lack
of
untiring
vigilance
in
supervising
the
men
who
are
being
employed
in
the
client
service
it
is
the
right
here
that
the
national
has
an
immense
advantage
over
the
small
agency
which
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
large
staff
of
men
constantly
on
hand
but
is
forced
to
engage
them
temporarily
as
they
may
be
needed
the
national
agency
can
shift
its
employees
from
place
to
place
as
their
services
are
required
and
the
advantages
of
centralization
are
felt
as
much
in
this
sort
of
work
as
in
any
other
industry
the
licensed
detective
who
sends
out
a
hurry
call
for
assistants
is
apt
to
be
able
to
get
only
men
whom
he
would
otherwise
not
employ
in
this
chapter
the
word
national
as
applied
to
a
detective
agency
refers
not
to
the
title
under
which
such
an
agency
may
do
its
business
but
to
the
fact
that
it
is
organized
and
equipped
to
render
services
all
over
the
country
in
this
connection
it
is
worth
noticing
that
the
best
detective
agencies
train
their
own
operators
selecting
them
from
picked
material
the
candidate
must
as
rule
be
between
twenty
and
years
of
age
sound
of
body
and
reasonably
intelligent
he
gets
pretty
good
wages
from
the
start
from
the
comparatively
easy
work
of
watching
or
locating
he
is
advanced
through
the
more
difficult
varieties
of
shadowing
and
trailing
until
eventually
he
may
develop
into
a
man
who
will
be
set
to
unravel
a
murder
mystery
or
to
rope
a
professional
criminal
but
with
years
of
training
the
best
material
makes
few
real
detectives
and
the
real
detective
remains
in
fact
the
man
who
sits
at
the
mahogany
desk
in
the
central
office
and
presses
the
row
of
mother
of
pearl
buttons
in
front
of
him
if
you
know
the
heads
or
superintendents
of
the
large
agencies
you
will
find
that
the
star
cases
of
which
they
like
to
talk
are
for
the
most
part
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
forgers
and
murderers
the
former
as
a
rule
are
spotted
and
trailed
to
their
haunts
and
when
sufficient
evidence
has
been
obtained
the
police
are
notified
and
a
raid
takes
place
or
the
arrest
is
made
by
the
state
authorities
in
the
case
of
a
murderer
in
a
majority
of
cases
his
capture
is
the
result
of
skilful
roping
by
an
astute
detective
who
manages
to
get
into
his
confidence
for
example
a
murder
is
committed
by
an
italian
miner
let
us
suppose
he
has
killed
his
boss
or
even
the
superintendent
or
owner
he
disappears
as
the
reader
known
the
italians
are
so
secretive
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
secure
any
information
even
from
the
relatives
of
the
murdered
man
the
first
thing
is
to
locate
the
assassin
an
italian
detective
is
sent
into
the
mine
as
a
laborer
months
may
elapse
before
he
gets
on
familiar
or
intimate
terms
with
his
fellows
all
the
time
he
is
listening
and
watching
presently
he
hears
something
that
indicates
that
the
murderer
is
communicating
with
one
of
his
old
friends
either
directly
or
through
third
parties
it
is
then
generally
only
a
question
of
time
before
his
whereabouts
are
ascertained
once
he
is
located
the
same
method
is
followed
in
securing
additional
evidence
or
material
in
the
nature
of
a
confession
or
admission
tending
to
establish
guilt
having
previously
roped
the
murderer
friends
the
detective
now
proceeds
to
the
more
difficult
task
of
roping
the
murderer
himself
of
course
the
life
of
a
detective
in
a
pennsylvania
coal
mine
would
be
valueless
if
his
identity
were
discovered
and
yet
the
most
daring
pieces
of
detective
work
are
constantly
being
performed
under
these
and
similar
conditions
where
the
criminal
is
not
known
the
task
becomes
far
more
difficult
and
at
times
exceedingly
dangerous
one
of
my
own
friends
an
italian
gentleman
spent
several
months
in
the
different
mines
of
this
country
where
italians
are
largely
employed
investigating
conditions
and
ascertaining
for
the
benefit
of
his
government
the
extent
to
which
anarchy
was
prevalent
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
secure
work
as
a
miner
at
the
lowest
wages
and
to
disguise
himself
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anybody
to
detect
his
true
character
fortunately
the
great
diversity
of
italian
dialects
facilitated
his
efforts
and
enabled
him
to
pass
himself
off
as
from
another
part
of
the
country
than
his
comrades
having
made
his
preparations
he
came
to
new
york
as
an
immigrant
and
joined
a
party
of
newly
arrived
italians
on
their
way
to
the
coal
mines
of
west
virginia
without
following
him
further
it
is
enough
to
say
that
during
his
service
in
the
mines
he
overheard
much
that
was
calculated
to
interest
exceedingly
the
authorities
at
rome
had
his
disguise
been
penetrated
the
quick
thrust
of
a
blade
would
have
ended
his
career
he
would
never
have
returned
to
new
york
there
would
only
have
been
another
dead
dago
miner
the
local
coroner
would
have
driven
up
in
his
buggy
looked
at
the
body
examined
the
clean
deep
wound
in
the
abdomen
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
empanelled
a
hetrogeneous
jury
who
would
have
returned
a
verdict
to
the
effect
that
deceased
came
to
his
death
through
a
stab
wound
inflicted
by
some
person
to
the
jury
unknown
my
friend
was
not
a
professional
detective
but
the
recital
of
his
experiences
was
enough
to
fill
me
with
new
respect
for
those
engaged
in
the
man
hunt
business
among
the
half
civilized
miners
of
the
coal
regions
but
the
work
of
even
the
national
agencies
is
not
of
the
kind
which
the
public
generally
associates
with
detectives
that
is
to
say
it
rarely
deals
with
the
unravelling
of
mysteries
except
the
identity
of
passers
of
fraudulent
paper
and
occasional
murderers
the
protection
of
the
banks
is
naturally
the
most
important
work
that
such
an
agency
can
perform
the
national
bankers
association
has
eleven
thousand
members
pinkerton
bank
and
bankers
protection
also
has
a
large
organization
of
subscribers
these
devote
themselves
to
identifying
and
running
down
all
criminals
whose
activities
are
dangerous
to
them
here
the
agency
and
the
police
work
hand
in
hand
exchanging
photographs
of
crooks
and
suspects
and
keeping
closely
informed
as
to
each
other
doings
yet
there
is
no
official
connection
between
any
detective
agency
and
the
police
of
any
city
it
is
an
almost
universal
rule
that
a
private
detective
shall
not
make
an
arrest
the
reasons
for
this
are
manifold
in
the
first
place
the
private
detective
has
neither
the
general
authority
nor
the
facilities
for
the
manual
detention
of
a
criminal
a
blue
coat
and
brass
buttons
to
say
nothing
of
a
night
stick
are
often
invaluable
stage
properties
in
the
last
act
of
the
melodrama
and
as
the
criminal
authorities
are
eventually
to
deal
with
the
defendant
anyway
it
is
just
as
well
if
they
come
into
the
case
as
soon
as
may
be
it
goes
without
saying
of
course
that
a
detective
per
se
has
no
more
right
to
make
an
arrest
than
any
private
citizen
nor
has
a
policeman
for
that
matter
save
in
exceptional
cases
the
officer
is
valuable
for
his
dignity
avoirdupois
bracelets
and
other
accessories
the
police
thus
get
the
credit
of
many
arrests
in
difficult
cases
where
all
the
work
has
been
done
by
private
detectives
and
it
is
good
business
for
the
latter
to
let
them
know
it
one
of
the
chief
assets
of
the
big
agency
is
its
accumulated
information
concerning
all
sorts
of
professional
criminals
its
galleries
are
quite
as
complete
as
those
of
the
local
police
headquarters
for
a
constant
exchange
of
art
objects
is
going
on
with
the
police
throughout
the
world
and
as
the
agency
is
protecting
banks
all
over
the
united
states
it
has
greater
interest
in
all
bank
burglars
as
a
class
than
the
police
of
any
particular
city
who
are
only
concerned
with
the
burglars
who
as
one
might
say
burgle
in
their
particular
burg
thus
you
are
more
likely
to
find
a
detective
from
a
national
agency
than
a
sleuth
from
mulberry
street
new
york
following
a
forger
to
australasia
or
polynesia
the
best
agencies
absolutely
decline
to
touch
divorce
and
matrimonial
cases
of
any
sort
it
does
not
do
a
detective
agency
any
good
to
have
its
men
constantly
upon
the
witness
stand
subject
to
attack
with
a
consequent
possible
reflection
upon
their
probity
of
character
or
truthfulness
moreover
a
good
detective
is
too
valuable
a
person
to
be
wasting
his
time
in
the
in
the
ordinary
divorce
case
the
detective
having
procured
evidence
is
obliged
to
remain
on
tap
and
subject
to
call
as
a
witness
for
at
least
three
or
four
months
during
which
time
he
can
not
be
sent
away
on
distant
work
neither
can
the
customer
be
charged
ordinarily
for
waiting
time
and
apart
from
its
malodorous
character
the
business
is
not
desirable
from
a
financial
point
of
view
the
national
agencies
prefer
clean
criminal
work
murder
cases
and
general
investigating
they
no
longer
undertake
any
policing
or
guarding
the
most
ridiculous
misinformation
in
regard
to
their
participation
in
this
sort
of
work
has
been
spread
broadcast
largely
by
jealous
enemies
and
by
the
labor
unions
by
way
of
illustration
one
thomas
beet
describing
himself
as
an
english
detective
contributed
an
article
to
the
york
tribune
of
september
in
which
he
said
in
one
of
the
greatest
of
our
strikes
that
involving
the
steel
industry
over
two
thousand
armed
detectives
were
employed
supposedly
to
protect
property
while
several
hundred
men
were
scattered
in
the
ranks
of
strikers
as
workmen
many
of
the
latter
became
officers
in
the
labor
bodies
helped
to
make
laws
for
the
organizations
made
incendiary
speeches
cast
their
votes
for
the
most
radical
movements
made
by
the
strikers
participated
in
and
led
bodies
of
the
members
in
the
acts
of
lawlessness
that
eventually
caused
the
sending
of
state
troops
and
the
declaration
of
martial
law
while
doing
this
these
spies
within
the
ranks
were
making
daily
reports
of
the
plans
and
purposes
of
the
strikers
to
my
knowledge
when
lawlessness
was
at
its
height
and
murder
ran
riot
these
men
wore
little
patches
of
white
on
the
lapels
of
their
coats
so
that
their
fellow
detectives
of
the
two
thousand
would
not
shoot
them
down
by
mistake
he
of
course
referred
to
the
great
strike
at
homestead
pennsylvania
in
in
point
of
fact
there
were
only
six
private
detectives
engaged
on
the
side
of
the
employers
at
that
time
and
these
were
there
to
assist
the
local
authorities
in
taking
charge
of
six
hundred
and
fifty
watchmen
and
to
help
place
the
latter
upon
the
property
of
the
steel
company
these
watchmen
were
under
the
direction
of
the
sheriff
and
sworn
in
as
peace
officers
of
the
county
beet
seems
to
have
confused
his
history
and
mixed
up
the
white
handkerchief
of
the
huguenots
of
nantes
with
the
of
pennsylvania
it
is
needless
to
repeat
as
robert
pinkerton
stated
at
the
time
that
the
white
label
story
is
ridiculously
untrue
and
that
it
was
the
strikers
who
attacked
the
watchmen
and
not
the
watchmen
the
strikers
one
striker
and
one
watchman
were
killed
but
this
attack
of
beet
upon
his
own
profession
under
the
guise
of
being
an
english
detective
it
developed
that
he
was
an
detective
from
new
york
city
was
not
confined
to
his
remarks
about
inciting
wanton
murder
on
the
contrary
he
alleged
as
one
having
authority
and
not
merely
as
a
scribe
that
american
detective
agencies
were
practically
nothing
but
blackmailing
concerns
which
used
the
information
secured
in
a
professional
capacity
to
extort
money
from
their
own
clients
think
of
the
detective
says
beet
whose
agency
pays
him
two
dollars
or
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
a
day
being
engaged
upon
confidential
work
and
in
the
possession
of
secrets
that
he
knows
are
worth
money
is
it
any
wonder
that
so
many
cases
are
sold
out
by
employees
even
when
the
agencies
are
honest
we
are
constrained
to
answer
that
it
is
no
more
wonderful
than
that
any
person
earning
the
same
sum
should
remain
honest
when
he
might
so
easily
turn
thief
as
the
writer
has
himself
pointed
out
in
these
pages
there
are
hundreds
of
detective
agencies
which
are
but
traps
for
the
guileless
citizen
who
calls
upon
them
for
aid
but
there
are
many
which
are
as
honestly
conducted
as
any
other
variety
of
legitimate
business
i
do
not
know
beet
personal
experience
but
it
appears
to
have
been
unfortunate
at
any
rate
his
diatribe
is
unfounded
and
false
and
the
worst
feature
of
it
is
his
assertion
that
detective
agencies
make
a
business
of
manufacturing
cases
when
there
happen
to
be
none
on
hand
soon
says
he
there
were
not
enough
cases
to
go
around
and
then
with
the
aid
of
spies
and
informers
the
unscrupulous
detectives
began
to
make
cases
agencies
began
to
work
up
evidence
against
persons
and
then
resorted
to
blackmail
or
else
approached
those
to
whom
the
information
might
be
valuable
and
by
careful
manoeuvring
had
themselves
retained
to
unravel
the
case
this
brought
into
existence
hordes
of
professional
informers
who
secured
the
opening
wedges
for
the
fake
agencies
men
and
women
many
of
them
of
some
social
standing
made
it
a
practice
to
pry
around
for
secrets
which
might
be
valuable
able
spies
kept
up
their
work
in
large
business
establishments
and
began
to
haunt
the
cafes
and
resorts
of
doubtful
reputation
on
the
watch
for
persons
of
wealth
and
prominence
who
might
be
foolish
enough
to
place
themselves
in
compromising
circumstances
even
the
servants
in
wealthy
families
soon
learned
that
certain
secrets
of
the
master
and
mistress
could
be
turned
to
profitable
account
we
shudder
when
we
hear
of
the
system
of
espionage
maintained
in
russia
while
in
the
large
american
cities
unnoticed
are
organizations
of
spies
and
informers
on
every
hand
who
spend
their
lives
digging
pitfalls
for
the
unwary
who
can
afford
to
pay
one
would
think
that
we
were
living
in
the
days
of
the
borgias
ninety
per
cent
says
beet
of
private
detective
agencies
are
rotten
to
the
core
and
simply
exist
and
thrive
upon
a
foundation
of
dishonesty
deceit
conspiracy
and
treachery
to
the
public
in
general
and
their
own
patrons
in
particular
there
are
detectives
at
the
heads
of
prominent
agencies
in
this
country
whose
pictures
adorn
the
rogues
gallery
men
who
have
served
time
in
various
prisons
for
almost
every
crime
on
the
calendar
this
harrowing
picture
has
the
modicum
of
truth
that
makes
it
insidiously
dangerous
but
this
last
extravagance
betrays
the
denunciator
one
would
be
interested
to
have
this
of
overstatement
mention
the
names
of
these
distinguished
crooks
that
head
the
prominent
agencies
their
exposure
if
true
would
not
be
libellous
and
it
would
seem
that
he
had
performed
but
half
his
duty
to
the
public
in
refraining
from
giving
this
important
if
not
vital
information
i
know
several
of
these
gentlemen
whose
pictures
i
feel
confident
do
not
appear
in
the
rogues
gallery
and
who
have
not
been
as
yet
convicted
of
crime
a
client
is
as
safe
in
the
hands
of
a
good
detective
agency
as
he
is
in
the
hands
of
a
good
attorney
he
should
know
his
agency
that
is
all
just
as
he
should
know
his
lawyer
the
men
at
the
head
of
the
big
agencies
generally
take
the
same
pride
in
their
work
as
the
members
of
any
other
profession
they
know
that
a
reputation
for
honesty
is
essential
to
their
financial
success
and
that
good
will
is
their
stock
in
trade
take
this
away
and
they
would
have
nothing
in
the
founder
of
one
of
the
most
famous
of
our
national
agencies
promulgated
in
printed
form
for
the
benefit
of
his
employees
what
he
called
his
general
principles
one
of
these
was
the
following
this
agency
only
offers
its
services
at
a
stated
per
diem
for
each
detective
employed
on
an
operation
giving
no
guarantee
of
success
except
in
the
reputation
for
reliability
and
efficiency
and
any
person
in
its
service
who
shall
under
any
circumstances
permit
himself
or
herself
to
receive
a
gift
reward
or
bribe
shall
be
instantly
dismissed
from
the
service
another
the
profession
of
the
detective
is
a
high
and
honorable
calling
few
professions
excel
it
he
is
an
officer
of
justice
and
must
himself
be
pure
and
above
reproach
again
it
is
an
evidence
of
the
unfitness
of
the
detective
for
his
profession
when
he
is
compelled
to
resort
to
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
and
indeed
the
strongest
kind
of
evidence
if
he
continually
resorts
to
this
evil
practice
the
detective
must
not
do
anything
to
farther
sink
the
criminal
in
vice
or
debauchery
but
on
the
contrary
must
seek
to
win
his
confidence
by
endeavoring
to
elevate
him
etc
kindness
and
justice
should
go
hand
in
hand
whenever
it
is
possible
in
the
dealings
of
the
detective
with
the
criminal
there
is
no
human
being
so
degraded
but
there
is
some
little
bright
spark
of
conscience
and
of
right
still
existing
in
him
last
the
detective
must
in
every
instance
report
everything
which
is
favorable
to
the
suspected
party
as
well
as
everything
which
may
be
against
him
the
man
who
penned
these
principles
had
had
the
safety
of
abraham
lincoln
in
his
keeping
and
these
simple
statements
are
the
best
refutation
of
the
baseless
assertions
above
referred
to
it
may
be
that
in
those
days
the
detection
of
crime
was
a
bit
more
elementary
than
at
the
present
time
one
can
hardly
picture
a
modern
sleuth
delaying
long
in
an
attempt
to
evangelize
his
quarry
but
these
general
principles
are
the
right
stuff
and
shine
like
good
deeds
in
a
naughty
world
as
one
peruses
this
little
pink
pamphlet
he
is
constantly
struck
by
the
repeated
references
to
the
detective
as
an
actor
that
was
undoubtedly
the
ancient
concept
of
a
sleuth
he
must
possess
also
the
faculty
of
assuming
any
character
that
his
case
may
require
and
of
acting
it
out
to
the
life
with
an
ease
and
naturalness
which
shall
not
be
questioned
this
somewhat
large
order
is
to
our
relief
qualified
a
little
later
on
it
is
not
to
be
expected
however
the
author
admits
that
every
detective
shall
possess
these
rare
qualifications
although
the
more
talented
and
versatile
he
is
the
higher
will
be
the
sphere
of
operation
which
he
will
command
the
modern
detective
agency
is
conducted
on
business
principles
and
does
not
look
for
histrionic
talent
or
general
versatility
as
one
of
the
heads
of
a
prominent
agency
said
to
me
the
other
day
when
we
want
a
detective
to
take
the
part
of
a
plumber
we
get
a
plumber
and
when
we
need
one
to
act
as
a
we
go
out
and
get
a
real
one
if
we
have
one
on
our
pay
rolls
but
i
replied
when
you
need
a
man
to
go
into
a
private
family
and
pretend
to
be
an
english
clergyman
or
a
french
viscount
or
a
brilliant
man
of
the
world
who
do
you
send
the
head
smiled
the
case
has
arisen
yet
said
he
when
it
does
i
guess
we
get
the
real
thing
the
national
detective
agency
with
its
thousands
of
employees
who
have
most
of
them
grown
up
and
received
their
training
in
its
service
is
a
powerful
organization
highly
centralized
and
having
an
immense
sinking
fund
of
special
knowledge
and
past
experience
this
is
the
product
of
decades
of
patient
labor
and
minute
record
the
agency
which
offers
you
the
services
of
a
sherlock
holmes
is
a
fraud
but
you
can
accept
as
genuine
a
proposition
to
run
down
any
man
whose
picture
you
may
be
able
to
identify
in
the
gallery
the
day
of
the
impersonator
is
over
the
detective
of
this
generation
is
a
business
man
with
a
stout
pair
of
legs
this
accumulated
fund
of
information
is
the
heritage
of
an
honest
and
long
established
industry
it
is
per
cent
of
its
capital
it
is
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
the
mushroom
agency
which
in
consequence
has
to
accept
less
desirable
retainers
involving
no
such
requirements
or
go
to
the
wall
the
collection
of
photographs
is
almost
priceless
and
the
clippings
letters
and
memoranda
in
the
filing
cases
only
secondarily
so
very
few
of
the
operators
pretend
to
anything
but
with
perhaps
some
special
knowledge
of
the
men
they
are
after
they
are
not
clairvoyants
or
mystery
men
but
they
will
tirelessly
follow
a
crook
until
they
get
him
they
are
the
regular
troops
who
take
their
orders
without
question
the
real
detective
is
the
boss
who
directs
them
the
reader
can
easily
see
that
in
all
cases
where
a
crime
such
as
forgery
is
concerned
once
the
identity
of
the
criminal
is
ascertained
half
the
work
or
more
than
half
is
done
the
agencies
know
the
face
and
record
of
practically
every
man
who
ever
flew
a
bit
of
bad
paper
in
the
united
states
in
england
or
on
the
continent
if
an
old
hand
gets
out
of
prison
his
movements
are
watched
until
it
is
obvious
that
he
does
not
intend
to
resort
to
his
old
tricks
after
the
criminal
is
known
or
located
the
trailing
begins
and
his
connections
are
carefully
studied
this
may
or
may
not
require
what
might
be
called
real
detective
work
that
is
to
say
work
requiring
superior
power
of
deducing
conclusions
from
information
coupled
with
unusual
skill
in
acting
upon
them
mere
trailing
is
often
simple
yet
sometimes
very
difficult
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
operator
own
peculiar
information
as
to
his
man
habits
haunts
and
associates
it
is
very
hard
to
say
in
most
cases
just
where
mere
knowledge
ends
and
detective
work
proper
begins
as
for
disguises
they
are
almost
unknown
except
such
as
are
necessary
to
enable
an
operator
to
join
a
gang
where
his
quarry
may
be
working
and
rope
him
into
a
confession
detective
agencies
of
the
are
engaged
principally
in
criminal
work
such
as
guarding
banks
from
forgers
and
yeggmen
an
original
and
dangerous
variety
of
burglar
peculiar
to
the
united
states
and
canada
in
other
words
they
have
large
associations
of
clients
who
need
more
protection
than
the
regular
police
can
give
them
and
whose
interest
it
is
that
the
criminal
shall
not
only
be
driven
out
of
town
but
run
down
wherever
he
may
be
captured
and
put
out
of
the
way
for
as
long
a
time
as
possible
the
work
done
for
private
individuals
is
no
less
important
and
effective
but
it
is
secondary
to
the
other
the
great
value
of
the
agency
to
the
victim
of
a
theft
is
the
speed
with
which
it
can
disseminate
its
information
something
quite
impossible
so
far
as
the
individual
citizen
is
concerned
let
me
give
an
illustration
or
two
between
saturday
february
and
sunday
february
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
pearls
belonging
to
maldwin
drummond
were
stolen
from
a
stateroom
on
the
steamship
of
the
line
the
london
underwriters
cabled
five
thousand
dollars
reward
and
retained
to
investigate
the
case
a
american
agency
which
before
the
had
reached
plymouth
on
her
return
trip
had
their
notifications
in
the
hands
of
all
the
jewelers
and
police
officials
of
europe
and
the
united
states
and
had
covered
every
avenue
of
disposal
in
north
and
south
america
in
addition
this
agency
investigated
every
human
being
on
the
amerika
from
first
cabin
to
forecastle
within
a
year
or
so
an
aged
named
bancroft
was
robbed
on
the
street
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
securities
inside
of
minutes
after
he
had
reported
his
loss
a
detective
agency
had
notified
all
banks
brokers
and
the
police
in
cities
of
the
united
states
and
canada
in
the
story
books
your
detective
scans
with
eagle
eye
the
surface
of
the
floor
for
microscopic
evidences
of
crime
his
mind
leaps
from
a
cigar
ash
to
a
piece
of
banana
peel
and
thence
to
what
the
family
had
for
dinner
his
brain
is
working
all
the
time
it
is
of
course
all
quite
wonderful
and
most
excellent
reading
and
the
sleuth
really
thought
he
could
do
it
nowadays
while
the
fake
detective
is
snooping
around
the
back
piazza
with
a
telescope
the
real
one
is
getting
the
dope
from
the
village
blacksmith
or
barber
or
the
waitress
at
the
station
he
may
not
be
highly
intelligent
but
he
knows
the
country
and
what
is
more
important
he
knows
the
people
all
the
brains
in
the
world
can
not
make
up
for
the
lack
of
an
elementary
knowledge
of
the
place
and
the
characters
themselves
it
stands
to
reason
that
no
strange
detective
could
form
as
good
an
opinion
as
to
which
of
the
members
of
your
household
would
be
most
likely
to
steal
a
piece
of
jewelry
as
you
could
yourself
yet
the
sherlock
knew
and
knows
it
all
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
the
practical
necessity
of
some
knowledge
is
that
afforded
by
the
recovery
of
a
diamond
necklace
belonging
to
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
in
a
connecticut
town
the
facts
that
are
given
here
are
absolutely
accurate
the
gentleman
in
question
was
a
retired
business
man
of
some
means
who
lived
not
far
from
the
town
and
who
made
frequent
visits
to
new
york
city
he
had
made
his
wife
a
present
of
a
fifteen
diamond
necklace
which
she
kept
in
a
box
in
a
locked
trunk
in
her
bedroom
while
she
had
owned
the
necklace
for
over
a
year
she
had
never
worn
it
one
evening
having
guests
for
dinner
on
the
occasion
of
her
wedding
anniversary
she
decided
to
put
it
on
and
wear
it
for
the
first
time
that
night
she
replaced
it
in
its
box
and
enclosed
this
in
another
box
which
she
locked
and
placed
in
her
bureau
drawer
this
she
also
locked
the
following
night
she
decided
to
replace
the
necklace
in
the
trunk
she
accordingly
unlocked
the
bureau
drawer
and
also
the
larger
box
which
apparently
was
in
exactly
the
same
condition
as
when
she
had
put
it
away
but
the
inner
box
was
empty
and
the
necklace
had
absolutely
disappeared
now
no
one
had
seen
the
necklace
for
a
year
and
then
only
her
husband
their
servants
and
two
or
three
old
friends
no
outsider
could
have
known
of
its
existence
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
house
or
bureau
having
been
disturbed
a
new
york
detective
agency
was
at
once
retained
which
sent
one
of
its
best
men
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
he
examined
the
servants
heard
the
story
and
reported
that
it
must
have
been
an
inside
job
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
anything
else
but
there
was
nothing
to
implicate
any
one
of
the
servants
and
there
seemed
no
hope
of
getting
the
necklace
back
two
or
three
days
later
the
husband
turned
up
at
the
office
in
new
york
and
after
beating
about
the
bush
for
a
while
remarked
i
want
to
tell
you
something
you
have
got
this
job
wrong
there
one
fact
your
man
did
understand
the
truth
is
that
i
a
pretty
easy
going
sort
and
every
six
months
or
so
i
take
all
the
men
and
girls
employed
around
my
house
down
to
coney
island
and
give
a
time
i
make
my
friends
and
i
dance
with
the
girls
and
i
jolly
up
the
men
and
we
are
all
good
pals
together
sort
of
unconventional
maybe
but
it
pays
i
know
see
that
there
is
a
single
one
of
those
people
who
would
do
me
a
mean
trick
not
one
of
but
would
lend
me
all
the
money
he
had
i
do
care
what
your
operator
says
the
person
who
took
that
necklace
came
from
outside
you
take
that
from
me
the
superintendent
who
is
wise
in
his
generation
scratched
his
chin
is
that
dead
on
the
level
he
inquired
gospel
answered
the
other
i
come
up
myself
said
the
boss
next
day
the
boss
behind
a
horse
in
a
dilapidated
buggy
drove
from
another
town
to
the
place
where
his
client
lived
at
the
smithy
on
the
crossroads
he
stopped
and
borrowed
a
match
anybody
have
good
hosses
in
this
town
asked
the
detective
sure
answered
the
smith
up
on
the
hill
has
the
best
in
the
county
what
sort
of
a
feller
is
he
the
smith
chewed
in
silence
for
a
moment
do
know
him
myself
but
i
tell
you
what
his
help
says
he
the
best
employer
they
ever
had
and
they
stay
there
forever
the
boss
drove
on
to
the
house
which
he
observed
was
situated
at
about
an
equal
distance
from
three
different
railway
stations
and
surrounded
by
a
piazza
with
pillars
he
walked
around
it
examining
the
vines
until
his
eye
caught
a
torn
creeper
and
a
white
scratch
on
the
paint
it
had
been
an
outside
job
after
all
and
two
weeks
had
already
been
lost
deduction
was
responsible
for
a
mistake
which
would
not
have
occurred
had
a
little
knowledge
been
acquired
first
that
is
the
lesson
of
this
story
the
denouement
which
has
no
lesson
at
all
is
interesting
the
superintendent
saw
no
prospect
of
getting
back
the
necklace
but
before
so
informing
the
client
decided
to
cogitate
on
the
matter
for
a
day
or
two
during
that
time
he
met
by
accident
a
friend
who
made
a
hobby
of
studying
yeggmen
and
criminals
and
occasionally
doing
a
bit
of
the
amateur
tramp
act
himself
by
the
way
said
the
friend
do
you
ever
hear
of
any
up
the
river
or
along
the
sound
sometimes
answered
the
boss
pricking
up
his
ears
why
do
you
ask
why
the
other
night
replied
the
friend
i
happened
to
be
meeting
my
wife
up
at
the
grand
central
about
six
and
i
saw
two
yeggs
that
i
knew
taking
a
train
out
i
thought
it
was
sort
of
funny
pittsburgh
ike
and
denver
red
when
was
it
two
weeks
ago
said
the
friend
thanks
returned
the
boss
you
must
excuse
me
now
i
got
an
important
engagement
three
hours
later
pittsburgh
ike
and
denver
red
were
in
a
cell
at
headquarters
at
six
that
evening
the
necklace
had
been
returned
this
was
a
coincidence
that
might
not
occur
in
a
hundred
years
but
had
the
deductive
detective
determined
the
question
he
would
still
be
pondering
on
the
comparative
probability
of
whether
the
cook
the
chore
man
or
the
hired
girl
was
the
guilty
party
a
clean
bit
of
detection
on
the
part
of
an
agency
and
quite
in
the
day
work
was
the
comparatively
recent
capture
of
a
thief
who
secured
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
securities
from
a
famous
banking
institution
in
new
york
city
by
means
of
a
very
simple
device
a
firm
of
stock
brokers
had
borrowed
from
this
bank
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
a
day
or
two
and
put
up
the
securities
as
collateral
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
when
the
borrower
has
no
further
use
for
the
money
he
sends
up
a
certified
check
for
the
amount
of
the
loan
with
interest
and
the
bank
turns
over
the
securities
to
the
messenger
in
this
particular
case
a
messenger
arrived
with
a
certified
check
shoved
it
into
the
cage
and
took
away
what
was
pushed
out
to
him
in
return
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
the
certification
turned
out
to
be
a
forgery
and
the
securities
vanished
i
do
not
know
whether
the
police
were
consulted
or
not
sometimes
in
such
cases
the
banks
prefer
to
resort
to
more
private
methods
and
perhaps
save
the
necessity
of
making
a
public
admission
of
their
stupidity
when
my
friend
the
superintendent
was
called
in
the
officers
of
the
bank
were
making
the
wildest
sort
of
guesses
as
to
the
identity
of
the
master
mind
and
hand
which
had
deceived
the
cashier
he
must
they
felt
sure
have
made
the
forgery
with
a
camel
hair
brush
of
unrivalled
fineness
a
great
artist
said
the
president
the
most
skilful
forger
in
the
world
opined
another
we
must
run
down
all
the
celebrated
criminals
announced
a
third
great
remarked
the
boss
rubbing
his
thumb
over
the
certification
which
blurred
at
the
touch
he
no
painter
why
a
rubber
stamp
what
a
shock
for
those
dignified
gentlemen
to
think
that
their
cashier
had
been
deceived
by
a
mere
plebeian
common
or
garden
thing
of
rubber
gents
said
the
boss
putting
the
check
in
his
wallet
got
to
get
busy
with
the
rubber
stamp
makers
he
returned
to
his
office
and
detailed
a
dozen
men
to
work
on
the
east
side
and
a
dozen
on
the
west
side
with
orders
to
search
out
every
man
in
new
york
who
manufactured
rubber
stamps
before
the
end
of
the
afternoon
the
maker
was
found
on
the
bowery
near
houston
street
this
was
his
story
a
couple
of
weeks
before
a
young
man
had
come
in
and
ordered
a
certification
stamp
drawing
at
the
time
a
rough
design
of
what
he
wanted
the
stamp
when
first
manufactured
had
not
been
satisfactory
to
him
and
on
his
second
visit
the
customer
had
left
a
piece
of
a
check
carefully
torn
out
in
circular
form
which
showed
the
certification
which
he
desired
copied
this
fragment
the
maker
had
retained
as
well
as
a
slip
of
paper
upon
which
the
customer
had
written
the
address
of
the
place
to
which
he
wished
the
stamp
sent
the
young
men
christian
association
the
face
of
the
fragment
showed
a
part
of
the
maker
signature
the
superintendent
ran
his
eye
over
a
list
of
brokers
and
picked
out
the
name
of
the
firm
most
like
the
hieroglyphics
on
the
check
then
he
telephoned
over
and
asked
to
be
permitted
to
see
their
pay
roll
carefully
comparing
the
signature
appearing
thereon
with
the
slip
he
picked
his
man
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
latter
was
carefully
trailed
to
his
home
and
thence
to
the
young
men
christian
association
after
which
he
called
on
his
fiancee
at
her
father
house
he
spent
the
night
at
his
own
boarding
place
next
morning
sunday
he
was
arrested
on
his
way
to
church
and
all
the
securities
except
some
that
he
later
returned
were
discovered
in
his
room
more
quick
work
the
amateur
method
had
been
very
simple
he
knew
that
the
loan
had
been
made
and
the
bonds
sent
to
the
bank
so
he
forged
a
check
certified
it
himself
and
collected
the
securities
of
course
he
was
a
bungler
and
took
a
hundred
rash
chances
a
good
example
of
the
value
of
the
accumulated
information
documentary
pictorial
and
otherwise
in
the
possession
of
an
agency
was
the
capture
of
charles
wells
more
generally
known
as
charles
fisher
alias
henry
conrad
an
forger
who
suddenly
resumed
his
activities
after
being
released
from
a
term
in
england
a
new
york
city
bank
had
paid
on
a
bogus
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollar
check
and
had
reported
its
loss
to
the
agency
in
question
the
superintendent
examined
the
check
although
fisher
had
been
in
confinement
for
six
years
on
the
other
side
spotted
it
as
his
work
the
next
step
was
to
find
the
forger
of
course
no
man
who
does
the
actual
scratching
attempts
to
lay
down
the
paper
that
task
is
up
to
the
presenter
the
cashier
of
the
bank
identified
in
the
agency
gallery
the
picture
of
the
man
who
had
brought
in
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollar
check
and
he
in
turn
proved
to
be
another
well
known
in
the
business
whose
whereabouts
in
new
york
were
not
difficult
to
ascertain
he
was
located
and
trailed
and
all
his
associates
noted
and
followed
in
due
course
he
connected
up
as
they
say
with
fisher
now
it
is
one
thing
to
follow
a
man
who
has
no
idea
that
he
is
being
followed
and
another
to
trail
a
man
who
is
as
suspicious
and
elusive
as
a
fox
a
professional
daily
business
is
to
observe
whether
or
not
he
is
being
followed
and
he
rarely
if
ever
makes
a
direct
move
if
he
wants
a
drink
at
the
saloon
across
the
street
he
will
by
preference
go
out
the
back
door
walk
around
the
block
and
dodge
in
the
side
entrance
under
the
tail
of
an
ice
wagon
in
this
case
the
detectives
followed
the
presenter
for
days
before
they
reached
fisher
and
when
they
did
they
had
still
to
locate
his
plant
the
arrest
in
this
case
illustrates
forcibly
the
chief
characteristic
of
successful
criminals
egotism
the
essential
quality
of
daring
required
in
their
pursuits
gives
them
an
extraordinary
degree
of
boldness
and
vanity
and
to
vanity
most
of
them
can
trace
their
fall
it
seems
incredible
that
fisher
should
have
returned
to
the
united
states
after
his
discharge
from
prison
and
immediately
resumed
his
operations
without
carefully
concealing
his
impedimenta
yet
when
he
was
run
down
in
a
family
apartment
house
the
detectives
found
in
his
valise
several
thousand
blank
and
model
checks
hundreds
of
letters
and
private
papers
a
work
on
modern
bank
methods
and
his
ticket
of
leave
from
england
this
man
was
a
successful
forger
and
because
he
was
successful
his
pride
in
himself
was
so
great
that
he
attributed
his
conviction
in
england
to
accident
and
really
felt
that
he
was
immune
on
his
release
the
arrest
of
such
a
man
often
presents
great
legal
difficulties
which
the
detectives
overcome
by
various
practical
methods
of
course
no
officer
without
a
search
warrant
has
a
right
to
enter
a
house
or
an
apartment
a
man
house
is
his
castle
mayor
gaynor
when
a
judge
in
a
famous
opinion
more
familiarly
known
in
the
lower
world
even
than
the
decalogue
laid
down
the
law
unequivocally
and
emphatically
in
this
regard
thus
in
the
fisher
case
the
defendant
having
been
arrested
on
the
street
the
detectives
desired
to
search
the
apartment
of
the
family
with
which
he
lived
they
did
this
by
first
inducing
the
tenant
to
open
the
door
and
after
satisfying
themselves
that
they
were
in
the
right
place
ordering
the
occupants
to
get
in
line
and
march
from
one
room
to
another
while
they
rummaged
for
evidence
of
course
we
had
no
right
to
do
it
but
they
did
know
we
had
said
the
boss
but
frequently
the
defendant
knows
his
rights
just
as
well
as
the
police
on
one
occasion
the
same
detective
who
arrested
fisher
wanted
to
take
another
man
out
of
an
apartment
where
he
had
been
run
to
earth
his
mother
aged
years
put
the
chain
on
the
door
and
politely
declined
to
open
it
all
the
evidence
against
the
forger
was
inside
the
apartment
and
he
was
actively
engaged
in
burning
it
up
in
the
kitchen
stove
in
half
an
hour
to
arrest
him
would
have
been
useless
the
detectives
stormed
and
threatened
but
the
old
crone
merely
grinned
at
them
she
hated
a
bull
as
much
as
did
her
son
fearing
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
they
summoned
a
detective
sergeant
from
but
although
he
sympathized
with
them
he
had
read
mayor
gaynor
decision
and
declined
to
take
any
chances
they
then
appealed
to
the
cop
on
the
beat
who
proved
more
reasonable
but
although
he
used
all
his
force
he
was
unable
to
break
down
the
door
which
had
in
the
meantime
been
reinforced
from
the
inside
after
about
an
hour
the
old
lady
unchained
the
door
and
invited
the
detectives
to
come
in
the
crook
was
sitting
by
the
window
smoking
a
cigar
and
reading
nicholas
while
all
evidence
of
his
crime
had
vanished
in
smoke
one
more
anecdote
at
the
expense
of
the
deductive
detective
a
watchman
was
murdered
the
safe
of
a
brewery
blown
open
and
the
contents
stolen
local
detectives
worked
on
the
case
and
satisfied
themselves
that
the
night
engineer
at
the
brewery
had
committed
the
crime
he
was
a
quiet
and
apparently
a
man
but
circumstances
were
conclusive
against
him
in
fact
he
had
been
traced
within
ten
minutes
of
the
murder
on
the
way
to
the
scene
of
the
homicide
but
some
little
link
was
lacking
and
the
brewery
officials
called
in
the
agency
the
first
thing
the
superintendent
did
was
to
look
over
the
engineer
at
first
sight
he
recognized
him
as
a
famous
crook
who
had
served
five
years
for
a
homicidal
assault
one
would
think
that
that
would
have
settled
the
matter
but
it
did
the
detective
said
nothing
to
his
associates
or
employers
but
called
on
the
engineer
that
evening
and
had
a
quiet
talk
with
him
in
which
he
satisfied
himself
that
the
man
was
entirely
innocent
the
man
had
served
his
time
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
was
leading
an
honest
decent
life
two
months
later
the
superintendent
caused
the
arrest
of
four
yeggmen
all
of
whom
were
convicted
and
are
now
serving
fifteen
years
each
for
the
crime
thus
the
reader
will
observe
that
there
are
just
a
few
more
real
detectives
still
left
in
the
you
can
find
them
incidentally
they
one
and
all
take
off
their
hats
to
scotland
yard
they
will
tell
you
that
the
englishman
may
be
slow
fancy
an
american
inspector
of
police
wearing
gray
suede
gloves
and
brewing
himself
a
dish
of
tea
in
his
office
at
four
but
that
once
he
goes
after
a
crook
he
is
bound
to
get
him
it
is
merely
a
question
of
time
i
may
add
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
heads
of
the
big
agencies
the
percentage
of
ability
in
the
new
york
detective
bureau
is
high
one
of
them
going
so
far
as
to
claim
that
fifty
per
cent
of
the
men
have
real
detective
ability
that
is
to
say
brains
that
is
rather
a
higher
average
than
one
finds
among
clergymen
and
lawyers
yet
it
may
be
so
chapter
vii
women
in
the
courts
as
witnesses
women
appear
in
the
criminal
courts
constantly
as
witnesses
although
less
frequently
as
complainants
and
defendants
as
complainants
are
always
witnesses
and
as
defendants
may
and
in
point
of
fact
generally
do
become
so
whatever
generalizations
are
possible
regarding
women
in
courts
of
law
can
most
easily
be
drawn
from
their
characteristics
as
givers
of
testimony
roughly
speaking
women
exhibit
about
the
same
idiosyncrasies
and
limitations
in
the
as
the
opposite
sex
and
at
first
thought
one
would
be
apt
to
say
that
it
would
be
fruitless
and
absurd
to
attempt
to
predicate
any
general
principles
in
regard
to
their
testimony
but
a
careful
study
of
female
witnesses
as
a
whole
will
result
in
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
their
evidence
has
virtues
and
limitations
peculiar
to
itself
the
ancient
theory
that
woman
was
man
inferior
showed
itself
in
the
tendency
to
reject
or
at
least
to
regard
with
suspicion
her
evidence
in
legal
matters
the
following
law
says
best
is
attributed
to
moses
by
josephus
the
testimony
of
women
not
be
received
on
account
of
the
levity
and
audacity
of
their
sex
a
law
which
looks
apocryphal
but
which
even
if
genuine
could
not
have
been
of
universal
application
the
law
of
ancient
rome
though
admitting
their
testimony
in
general
refused
it
in
certain
cases
the
civil
canon
laws
of
mediaeval
europe
seem
to
have
carried
the
exclusion
much
further
mascardus
says
plerumque
omnino
non
creditur
et
id
dumtaxat
quod
sunt
feminae
qua
ut
plurimum
solent
esse
fraudulentre
fallaces
et
generally
speaking
no
credence
at
all
is
given
to
women
and
for
this
reason
because
they
are
women
who
are
usually
deceitful
untruthful
and
treacherous
in
the
very
highest
degree
and
lancelottus
in
his
juris
canonici
lays
it
down
in
the
most
distinct
terms
that
women
can
not
in
general
be
witnesses
citing
the
language
of
virgil
et
mutabile
semper
femina
bruneau
although
a
contemporary
of
madame
de
sevigne
did
not
scruple
to
write
in
that
the
deposition
of
three
women
was
only
equal
to
that
of
two
men
at
berne
so
late
as
in
the
canton
of
vaud
so
late
as
the
testimony
of
two
women
was
required
to
counterbalance
that
of
one
man
a
virgin
was
entitled
to
greater
credit
than
a
widow
in
the
institutions
of
devotus
published
at
paris
in
it
is
distinctly
stated
that
except
in
a
few
peculiar
instances
women
are
not
competent
witnesses
in
criminal
cases
in
scotland
also
until
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
sex
was
a
cause
of
exclusion
from
the
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
cockburn
in
his
memoirs
tells
of
an
incident
during
the
trial
of
glengarry
in
scotland
for
murder
in
a
duel
which
is
perhaps
explicable
by
this
extraordinary
attitude
a
lady
of
great
beauty
was
called
as
a
witness
and
came
into
court
heavily
veiled
before
administering
the
oath
lord
eskgrove
the
judge
to
whom
this
function
belongs
in
scotland
gave
her
this
exposition
of
her
duty
young
woman
you
will
now
consider
yourself
as
in
the
presence
of
almighty
god
and
of
this
high
court
lift
up
your
veil
throw
off
all
your
modesty
and
look
me
in
the
face
whatever
difference
does
exist
in
character
between
the
testimony
of
men
and
women
has
its
root
in
the
generally
recognized
diversity
in
the
mental
processes
of
the
two
sexes
men
it
is
commonly
declared
rely
upon
their
powers
of
reason
women
upon
their
intuition
not
that
the
former
is
frequently
any
more
accurate
than
the
latter
but
our
courts
of
law
at
least
those
in
countries
are
devised
and
organized
perhaps
unfortunately
on
the
principle
that
testimony
not
apparently
deduced
by
the
syllogistic
method
from
the
observation
of
relevant
fact
is
valueless
and
hence
woman
at
the
very
outset
is
placed
at
a
disadvantage
and
her
usefulness
as
a
probative
force
sadly
crippled
the
good
old
lady
who
takes
the
and
swears
that
she
knows
the
prisoner
took
her
purse
has
perhaps
quite
as
good
a
basis
for
her
opinion
and
her
testimony
even
though
she
can
not
give
a
single
reason
for
her
belief
and
becomes
hopelessly
confused
on
as
the
man
who
reaches
the
same
conclusion
ostensibly
by
virtue
of
having
seen
the
defendant
near
by
observed
his
hand
reaching
for
the
purse
and
then
perceived
him
take
to
his
heels
she
has
never
been
taught
to
reason
and
has
really
never
found
it
necessary
having
wandered
through
life
by
inference
or
more
frankly
by
guesswork
until
she
is
no
longer
able
to
point
out
the
simplest
stages
of
her
most
ordinary
mental
processes
as
the
reader
is
already
aware
the
value
of
all
honestly
given
testimony
depends
first
upon
the
witness
original
capacity
to
observe
the
facts
second
upon
his
ability
to
remember
what
he
has
seen
and
not
to
confuse
knowledge
with
imagination
belief
or
custom
and
lastly
upon
his
power
to
express
what
he
has
in
fact
seen
and
remembers
women
do
not
differ
from
men
in
their
original
capacity
to
observe
which
is
a
quality
developed
by
the
training
and
environment
of
the
individual
it
is
in
the
second
class
of
the
witness
limitations
that
women
as
a
whole
are
more
likely
to
trip
than
men
for
they
are
prone
to
swear
to
circumstances
as
facts
of
their
own
knowledge
simply
because
they
confuse
what
they
have
really
observed
with
what
they
believe
did
occur
or
should
have
occurred
or
with
what
they
are
convinced
did
happen
simply
because
it
was
accustomed
to
happen
in
the
past
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
the
female
habit
of
swearing
that
facts
occurred
because
they
usually
occurred
was
exhibited
in
the
twitchell
murder
trial
in
philadelphia
cited
in
wellman
art
of
the
defendant
had
killed
his
wife
with
a
blackjack
and
having
dragged
her
body
into
the
back
yard
carefully
unbolted
the
gate
leading
to
the
adjacent
alley
and
retiring
to
the
house
went
to
bed
his
purpose
was
to
create
the
impression
that
she
had
been
murdered
by
some
one
from
outside
the
premises
to
carry
out
the
suggestion
he
bent
a
poker
and
left
it
lying
near
the
body
smeared
with
blood
in
the
morning
the
servant
girl
found
her
mistress
and
ran
shrieking
into
the
street
at
the
trial
she
swore
positively
that
she
was
first
obliged
to
unbolt
the
door
in
order
to
get
out
nothing
could
shake
her
testimony
and
she
thus
unconsciously
negatived
the
entire
value
of
the
defendant
adroit
precautions
he
was
justly
convicted
although
upon
absolutely
erroneous
testimony
the
old
english
lawyers
occasionally
rejected
the
evidence
of
women
on
the
ground
that
they
are
frail
but
the
exclusion
of
women
as
witnesses
in
the
old
days
was
not
for
psychological
reasons
nor
did
it
originate
from
a
critical
study
of
the
probative
value
of
their
testimony
though
the
conclusions
to
which
women
frequently
jump
may
usually
be
shown
by
careful
interrogation
to
be
founded
upon
observation
of
actual
fact
their
habit
of
stating
inferences
often
leads
them
to
claim
knowledge
of
the
impossible
wiser
in
their
own
conceit
than
seven
men
that
can
render
a
reason
in
a
very
recent
case
where
a
clever
thief
had
been
convicted
of
looting
various
apartments
in
new
york
city
of
over
eighty
thousand
worth
of
jewelry
the
female
owners
were
summoned
to
identify
their
property
the
writer
believes
that
in
every
instance
these
ladies
were
absolutely
ingenuous
and
intended
to
tell
the
absolute
truth
each
and
every
one
positively
identified
various
of
the
loose
stones
found
in
the
possession
of
the
prisoner
as
her
own
this
was
the
case
even
when
the
diamonds
emeralds
and
pearls
had
no
distinguishing
marks
at
all
it
was
a
human
impossibility
actually
to
identify
any
such
objects
and
yet
these
eminently
respectable
and
intelligent
gentlewomen
swore
positively
that
they
could
recognize
their
jewels
they
drew
the
inference
merely
that
as
the
prisoner
had
stolen
similar
jewels
from
them
these
must
be
the
actual
ones
which
they
had
lost
an
inference
very
likely
correct
but
valueless
in
a
tribunal
of
justice
where
their
inferences
are
questioned
women
as
a
rule
are
much
more
ready
to
swear
their
testimony
through
than
men
they
are
so
accustomed
to
act
upon
inference
that
finding
themselves
unable
to
substantiate
their
assertion
by
any
sufficient
reason
they
become
irritated
show
fight
and
seek
refuge
in
prevarication
had
they
not
during
their
entire
lives
been
accustomed
to
mental
they
would
be
spared
the
humiliation
of
seeing
their
evidence
stricken
from
the
record
one
of
the
ladies
referred
to
testified
as
follows
can
you
identify
that
diamond
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
mine
how
do
you
know
it
looks
exactly
like
it
but
may
it
not
be
a
similar
one
and
not
your
own
no
it
is
mine
but
how
it
has
no
marks
i
do
care
i
know
it
is
mine
i
swear
it
is
the
good
lady
supposed
that
unless
she
swore
to
the
fact
she
might
lose
her
jewel
which
was
of
course
not
the
case
at
all
as
the
sworn
testimony
founded
upon
nothing
but
inference
left
her
in
no
better
position
than
she
was
in
before
the
writer
regrets
to
say
that
observation
would
lead
him
to
believe
that
women
as
a
rule
have
somewhat
less
regard
for
the
spirit
of
their
oaths
than
men
and
that
they
are
more
ready
if
it
be
necessary
to
commit
perjury
this
may
arise
from
the
fact
that
women
are
fully
aware
that
their
sex
protects
them
from
the
same
severity
of
to
which
men
would
be
subjected
under
similar
circumstances
it
is
today
fatal
to
a
lawyer
case
if
he
be
not
invariably
gentle
and
courteous
with
a
female
witness
and
this
is
true
even
if
she
be
a
veritable
sapphira
in
spite
of
these
limitations
which
of
course
affect
the
testimony
of
almost
every
person
irrespective
of
sex
women
with
the
possible
exception
of
children
make
the
most
remarkable
witnesses
to
be
found
in
the
courts
they
are
almost
invariably
quick
and
positive
in
their
answers
keenly
alive
to
the
dramatic
possibilities
of
the
situation
and
with
an
unerring
instinct
for
a
trap
or
compromising
admission
a
woman
will
inevitably
couple
with
a
categorical
answer
to
a
question
if
in
truth
she
can
be
induced
to
give
one
at
all
a
statement
of
damaging
character
to
her
opponent
for
example
do
you
know
the
defendant
yes
to
my
cost
or
how
old
are
you
old
enough
to
have
known
better
than
to
trust
him
forced
to
make
an
admission
which
would
seem
to
hurt
her
position
the
explanation
instead
of
being
left
for
the
examination
of
her
own
counsel
is
instantly
added
to
her
answer
then
and
there
do
you
admit
that
you
were
on
street
at
midnight
yes
but
it
was
in
response
to
a
message
sent
by
the
defendant
through
his
cousin
what
is
commonly
known
as
silent
is
generally
the
most
effective
the
jury
realize
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
for
the
lawyer
and
are
not
unlikely
to
sympathize
with
him
unless
he
makes
bold
to
attack
the
witness
when
they
quickly
chance
their
attitude
one
question
and
that
as
to
the
witness
means
of
livelihood
is
often
sufficient
how
do
you
support
yourself
i
am
a
lady
of
leisure
replies
the
witness
arrayed
in
flamboyant
colors
snappishly
that
will
do
thank
you
remarks
the
lawyer
with
a
smile
you
may
step
down
the
writer
remembers
being
nicely
hoisted
by
his
own
petard
on
a
similar
occasion
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
he
asked
the
witness
a
rather
deceptively
arrayed
woman
turned
upon
him
with
a
glance
of
contempt
i
am
a
respectable
married
woman
with
seven
children
she
retorted
i
do
nothing
for
a
living
except
cook
wash
scrub
make
beds
clean
windows
mend
my
children
clothes
mind
the
baby
teach
the
four
oldest
their
lessons
take
care
of
my
husband
and
try
to
get
enough
sleep
to
be
up
by
five
in
the
morning
i
guess
if
some
lawyers
worked
as
hard
as
i
do
they
would
have
sense
enough
not
to
ask
impertinent
questions
an
amusing
incident
is
recorded
of
how
a
feminine
witness
turned
the
laugh
upon
francis
wellman
the
noted
in
his
book
he
takes
the
opportunity
to
advise
his
lawyer
readers
to
avoid
the
mistake
so
common
among
the
inexperienced
of
making
much
of
trifling
discrepancies
it
has
been
aptly
said
he
continues
that
have
no
respect
for
small
triumphs
over
a
witness
or
memory
allow
the
loquacious
witness
to
talk
on
he
will
be
sure
to
involve
himself
in
difficulties
from
which
he
can
never
extricate
himself
some
witnesses
prove
altogether
too
much
encourage
them
and
lead
them
by
degrees
into
exaggerations
that
will
conflict
with
the
of
the
jury
wellman
is
famous
for
following
this
precept
himself
and
with
one
eye
significantly
cast
upon
the
jury
is
likely
to
lead
his
witness
a
merry
dance
until
the
latter
is
finally
bogged
in
a
quagmire
of
absurdities
not
long
ago
shortly
after
the
publication
of
his
book
the
lawyer
had
occasion
to
a
young
woman
as
to
the
speed
of
an
electric
car
the
witness
seemed
conscious
that
she
was
about
to
undergo
a
severe
ordeal
and
wellman
feeling
himself
complete
master
of
the
situation
began
in
his
most
winsome
and
deprecating
manner
and
how
fast
miss
would
you
say
the
car
was
going
i
really
could
not
tell
exactly
mr
wellman
would
you
say
that
it
was
going
at
ten
miles
an
hour
oh
fully
that
twenty
miles
an
hour
yes
i
should
say
it
was
going
twenty
miles
an
hour
will
you
say
it
was
going
thirty
miles
an
hour
inquired
wellman
with
a
glance
at
the
jury
why
yes
i
will
say
that
it
was
will
you
say
it
was
going
forty
yes
fifty
yes
i
will
say
so
seventy
yes
eighty
yes
responded
the
young
lady
with
a
countenance
absolutely
devoid
of
expression
a
hundred
inquired
the
lawyer
with
a
thrill
of
eager
triumph
in
his
voice
there
was
a
significant
hush
in
the
then
the
witness
with
a
patient
smile
and
a
slight
lifting
of
her
pretty
eyebrows
remarked
quietly
wellman
do
you
think
we
have
carried
our
little
joke
far
enough
there
is
no
witness
in
the
world
more
difficult
to
cope
with
than
a
shrewd
old
woman
who
apes
stupidity
only
to
reiterate
the
gist
of
her
testimony
in
such
incisive
fashion
as
to
leave
it
indelibly
imprinted
on
the
minds
of
the
jury
the
lawyer
is
bound
by
every
law
of
decency
policy
and
manners
to
treat
the
aged
dame
with
the
utmost
consideration
he
must
allow
her
to
ramble
on
discursively
in
defiance
of
every
rule
of
law
and
evidence
in
answer
to
the
simplest
question
must
receive
imperturbably
the
opinions
and
speculations
upon
every
subject
of
both
herself
and
through
her
of
her
neighbors
only
to
find
when
he
thinks
she
must
be
exhausted
by
her
own
volubility
that
she
is
ready
at
the
slightest
opportunity
to
break
away
again
into
a
tangle
of
guesswork
and
hearsay
interwoven
with
conclusions
and
ejaculation
woe
be
unto
him
if
he
has
not
sense
enough
to
waive
her
off
the
stand
he
might
as
well
try
to
harness
a
valkyrie
as
to
restrain
a
pugnacious
old
irishwoman
who
is
intent
on
getting
the
whole
business
before
the
jury
in
her
own
way
in
the
recent
case
of
gustav
dinser
convicted
of
murder
a
vigorous
old
lady
took
the
stand
and
testified
forcibly
against
the
accused
she
was
as
smart
as
paint
as
the
saying
goes
and
resolutely
refused
to
answer
any
questions
put
to
her
by
counsel
for
the
defence
instead
she
would
raise
her
voice
and
make
a
savage
onslaught
upon
the
prisoner
rehearsing
his
brutal
treatment
of
the
deceased
on
previous
occasions
and
getting
in
the
most
damaging
testimony
do
you
say
the
lawyer
would
inquire
deferentially
that
you
heard
the
sound
of
three
blows
oh
thim
blows
the
old
lady
would
cry
thim
turrible
blows
i
could
hear
the
villain
as
he
laid
thim
on
i
could
hear
the
poor
pitiful
groans
av
her
and
she
so
sufferin
was
awful
howly
saints
make
yer
blood
run
cowld
stop
stop
exclaimed
the
lawyer
ah
stop
is
it
ye
ca
stop
me
till
oi
had
me
say
to
tell
the
whole
truth
i
says
to
me
daughter
ellen
says
i
horrid
baste
is
afther
murtherin
the
poor
thing
says
i
out
an
git
an
officer
i
object
to
all
this
shouts
the
lawyer
ah
ye
objec
do
ye
retorts
the
old
lady
shure
an
ye
have
been
after
objectin
if
ye
heard
thim
turrible
blows
that
kilt
her
the
poor
sufferin
swate
crayter
i
hope
he
gits
all
that
comin
to
him
bad
cess
to
him
for
a
divil
the
lawyer
ignominiously
abandoned
the
attack
the
writer
recalls
a
somewhat
similar
instance
but
one
even
better
exhibiting
the
cleverness
of
an
old
woman
which
occurred
in
the
year
a
man
named
orlando
hackett
of
prepossessing
appearance
and
manners
was
on
trial
charged
with
converting
to
his
own
use
money
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
investment
in
realty
the
complainant
was
a
shrewd
old
lady
who
together
with
her
daughter
had
had
a
long
series
of
transactions
with
hackett
which
would
have
entirely
confused
the
issue
could
the
defence
have
brought
them
before
the
jury
the
whole
contention
of
the
prosecution
was
that
hackett
had
received
the
money
for
one
purpose
and
used
it
for
another
during
preparation
for
the
trial
the
writer
had
had
both
ladies
in
his
office
and
remembers
making
the
remark
now
do
forget
that
the
charge
here
is
that
you
gave
hackett
the
money
to
put
into
real
estate
nothing
else
is
comparatively
of
much
importance
be
sure
and
remember
that
mother
the
daughter
had
admonished
her
in
the
course
of
a
month
the
case
came
on
for
trial
before
recorder
goff
in
part
ii
of
the
general
sessions
gave
her
testimony
with
great
positiveness
lewis
stuyvesant
chanler
now
of
the
state
arose
to
her
madam
he
began
courteously
you
say
you
gave
the
defendant
money
i
told
him
to
put
it
into
real
estate
and
he
said
he
would
replied
firmly
i
did
not
ask
you
that
politely
interjected
chanler
how
much
did
you
give
him
i
told
him
to
put
it
into
real
estate
and
he
said
he
would
repeated
the
old
lady
wearily
but
madam
you
do
not
answer
my
question
exclaimed
chanler
how
much
did
you
give
him
i
told
him
to
put
it
into
real
began
the
old
lady
again
yes
yes
cried
the
lawyer
we
know
that
answer
the
question
estate
and
he
said
he
would
finished
the
old
woman
innocently
if
your
honor
please
i
will
excuse
the
witness
and
i
move
that
her
answers
be
stricken
out
cried
chanler
savagely
the
old
lady
was
assisted
from
the
stand
but
as
she
made
her
way
with
difficulty
towards
the
door
of
the
she
could
be
heard
repeating
stubbornly
i
told
him
to
put
it
into
real
estate
and
he
said
he
would
almost
needless
to
say
hackett
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
seven
years
in
state
prison
to
recapitulate
the
quickness
and
positiveness
of
women
make
them
ordinarily
better
witnesses
than
men
they
are
vastly
more
difficult
to
their
sex
protects
them
from
many
of
the
most
effective
weapons
of
the
lawyer
with
the
result
that
they
are
the
more
ready
to
yield
to
prevarication
and
even
where
the
possibility
of
complete
and
unrestricted
is
afforded
their
tendency
to
inaccurately
inferential
reasoning
and
their
elusiveness
in
dodging
from
one
conclusion
to
another
render
the
opportunity
of
little
value
in
general
however
women
testimony
differs
little
in
quality
from
that
of
men
all
testimony
being
subject
to
the
same
three
great
limitations
irrespective
of
the
sex
of
the
witness
and
the
conclusions
set
forth
above
are
merely
the
result
of
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
writer
to
comment
somewhat
upon
those
small
differences
which
under
close
scrutiny
may
fairly
be
said
to
exist
these
differences
are
quite
as
noticeable
at
the
as
in
the
and
are
no
more
patent
to
the
advocate
than
to
the
ordinary
male
animal
whose
forehead
habitually
reddens
when
he
hears
the
unanswerable
reason
which
in
default
of
all
others
explains
and
glorifies
the
mental
action
of
his
wife
sister
or
mother
just
because
as
complainants
and
defendants
the
ratio
of
women
to
men
indicted
and
tried
for
crime
is
roughly
about
one
to
ten
could
adequate
statistics
be
procured
the
proportion
of
female
to
male
complainants
in
criminal
cases
would
very
likely
prove
to
be
about
the
same
in
a
very
substantial
proportion
therefore
of
all
prosecutions
for
crime
a
woman
is
one
of
the
chief
actors
the
law
of
the
land
compels
the
female
prisoner
to
submit
the
question
of
her
guilt
or
innocence
to
twelve
individuals
of
the
opposite
sex
and
permits
the
female
complainant
to
rehearse
the
story
of
her
wrongs
before
the
same
collection
of
colossal
intellects
and
adamantine
hearts
the
first
thing
the
ordinary
woman
hastens
to
do
if
she
be
summoned
to
appear
in
a
court
of
justice
is
not
as
might
be
expected
to
think
over
her
testimony
or
try
to
recall
facts
obliterated
or
confused
by
time
but
to
buy
a
new
hat
and
precisely
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
female
defendant
called
to
the
bar
of
justice
whether
it
be
for
stealing
a
pair
of
gloves
or
poisoning
her
lover
yet
how
far
does
the
element
of
sex
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
to
answer
this
question
it
is
necessary
to
determine
how
far
juries
are
liable
to
favor
the
testimony
of
a
woman
plaintiff
merely
because
she
is
a
woman
and
how
far
sympathy
for
a
woman
arraigned
as
a
prisoner
is
likely
to
warp
their
judgment
as
to
the
first
it
is
fairly
safe
to
say
that
a
woman
is
much
more
likely
to
win
a
verdict
in
a
civil
court
or
to
persuade
the
jury
that
the
prisoner
is
guilty
in
a
criminal
case
than
a
man
would
be
in
precisely
similar
circumstances
in
most
criminal
prosecutions
for
the
ordinary
run
of
felonies
little
injustice
is
likely
to
result
from
this
there
is
one
exception
however
where
juries
should
reach
conclusions
with
extreme
caution
namely
where
certain
charges
are
brought
by
women
against
members
of
the
opposite
sex
here
the
jury
is
apt
to
leap
to
a
conclusion
rendered
easy
by
the
attractiveness
of
the
witness
and
the
feeling
that
the
defendant
is
a
cur
anyway
and
ought
to
be
sent
up
the
difficulty
of
determining
even
in
one
office
the
true
character
of
a
plausible
woman
is
enhanced
tenfold
in
the
where
the
lawyer
is
generally
compelled
to
proceed
upon
the
assumption
that
the
witness
is
a
person
of
irreproachable
life
and
antecedents
almost
any
young
woman
may
create
a
favorable
impression
provided
her
taste
in
dress
be
not
too
crude
and
even
when
it
is
so
the
jury
are
not
apt
to
distinguish
carefully
between
that
which
cries
to
heaven
and
that
which
is
merely
elegant
when
the
complaining
witness
is
a
woman
who
has
merely
lost
money
through
the
acts
of
the
defendant
the
jury
are
not
so
readily
moved
to
accept
her
story
in
toto
as
when
the
crime
charged
is
of
a
different
character
they
realize
that
the
complainant
feeling
that
she
has
been
injured
may
be
inclined
to
color
her
testimony
perhaps
unconsciously
until
the
wrong
becomes
a
crime
an
ordinary
example
of
this
variety
of
prosecution
is
where
the
witness
is
a
young
woman
from
the
east
side
usually
a
polish
or
russian
jewess
who
charges
the
defendant
a
youth
of
about
her
own
age
with
stealing
her
money
by
means
of
false
pretences
they
have
been
engaged
to
be
married
and
she
has
turned
over
her
small
savings
to
him
to
purchase
the
diamond
ring
and
perhaps
set
him
up
in
a
modest
business
of
his
own
he
has
then
fallen
in
love
with
some
other
girl
has
broken
the
engagement
and
the
ring
now
adorns
the
fourth
finger
of
her
rival
her
money
is
gone
she
is
without
a
dot
she
hurries
with
her
parents
and
loudly
vociferating
friends
to
the
essex
market
police
court
and
secures
a
warrant
for
the
defendant
on
the
theory
that
he
defrauded
her
by
trick
and
device
or
false
representations
usually
the
only
representation
has
been
a
promise
to
marry
her
her
real
motive
is
revenge
upon
her
faithless
fiance
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
fellow
is
a
cad
who
has
deliberately
deserted
her
after
getting
her
money
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
real
crime
is
involved
if
the
judge
lets
the
case
go
to
the
jury
it
is
a
pure
gamble
as
to
what
the
result
will
be
and
it
may
largely
turn
on
the
girl
physical
attractiveness
if
she
be
pretty
and
demure
a
mixture
of
emotions
is
aroused
in
the
jury
he
probably
did
love
her
say
the
twelve
because
any
one
would
be
likely
to
do
so
if
he
did
love
her
of
course
he
did
falsely
pretend
to
do
so
but
if
he
deserted
a
woman
like
that
he
ought
to
be
in
jail
anyway
thus
the
argument
that
ought
to
acquit
in
fact
may
convict
the
defendant
if
the
rival
also
is
pretty
hopeless
confusion
results
while
if
the
complainant
be
a
homely
girl
the
jury
feels
that
he
must
have
intended
to
swindle
her
anyway
as
he
could
never
have
honestly
intended
to
marry
her
thus
in
any
case
the
lothario
is
apt
to
pay
a
severe
penalty
for
his
faithlessness
the
man
prosecuted
by
a
woman
provided
she
can
not
be
persuaded
to
withdraw
the
charge
against
him
is
likely
to
get
but
cold
consideration
for
his
side
of
the
story
and
short
shrift
in
the
turn
about
if
he
can
get
a
young
and
attractive
woman
to
swear
to
his
alibi
or
good
reputation
the
honest
masculine
citizen
whom
he
has
defrauded
may
very
likely
have
to
whistle
for
his
revenge
many
a
scamp
has
gone
free
by
producing
some
sweetly
demure
maiden
who
faithfully
swears
that
she
knows
him
to
be
an
honest
man
a
blush
at
the
psychological
moment
and
a
wink
from
the
lawyer
is
quite
enough
to
lead
the
jury
to
believe
that
if
they
acquit
the
defendant
they
will
make
the
young
lady
happy
whereas
if
he
is
convicted
she
will
remain
for
aye
a
spinster
like
enough
she
may
be
only
the
merest
acquaintance
the
writer
is
not
likely
to
forget
a
distinguished
lawyer
instructions
to
his
client
who
happened
also
to
be
a
childhood
acquaintance
as
she
was
about
to
go
into
court
as
the
plaintiff
in
a
suit
for
damages
i
would
fold
my
hands
in
my
lap
gwendolyn
yes
like
that
and
be
calm
very
calm
and
gwendolyn
above
all
things
be
demure
gwendolyn
be
demure
gwendolyn
was
the
demurest
of
the
demure
letting
her
eyes
fall
beneath
their
pendant
black
lashes
at
the
conclusion
of
each
answer
and
won
her
case
without
the
slightest
difficulty
the
unconscious
or
conscious
influence
of
women
upon
the
intellects
of
jurymen
has
given
rise
to
a
very
prevalent
impression
that
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
successfully
to
prosecute
a
woman
for
crime
this
feeling
expresses
itself
in
general
statements
to
the
effect
that
as
things
stand
a
woman
may
commit
murder
with
impunity
experience
supplemented
by
the
official
records
demonstrates
however
that
curious
as
it
must
seem
the
same
sentiment
aroused
by
a
woman
supposed
to
have
been
wronged
is
not
inspired
in
a
jury
by
a
woman
accused
of
crime
it
is
indeed
true
that
juries
are
apt
to
be
more
lenient
with
women
than
with
men
but
this
leniency
shows
itself
not
in
acquitting
them
of
the
crimes
charged
against
them
but
of
finding
them
guilty
in
lower
degrees
of
course
flagrant
miscarriages
of
justice
frequently
occur
which
by
reason
of
their
widespread
publicity
in
the
press
would
seem
to
justify
the
almost
universal
opinion
that
women
are
immune
from
the
penalities
for
homicide
it
is
also
true
that
such
miscarriages
of
justice
are
more
likely
when
the
defendant
is
a
woman
than
if
he
be
a
man
one
of
these
hysterical
acquittals
which
give
color
to
popular
impression
but
which
the
writer
believes
to
be
an
exception
was
the
case
of
a
young
mother
tried
and
acquitted
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
december
this
young
woman
whose
history
was
pathetic
in
the
extreme
was
shown
clearly
by
the
evidence
to
have
deliberately
taken
the
life
of
her
child
by
giving
it
carbolic
acid
the
story
was
a
shocking
one
yet
the
jury
apparently
never
considered
at
all
the
possibility
of
convicting
her
but
on
retiring
to
the
spent
their
time
in
discussing
how
much
money
they
should
present
her
on
her
acquittal
no
better
actor
ever
played
a
part
upon
the
stage
than
old
bill
howe
his
every
move
and
gesture
was
considered
with
reference
to
its
effect
upon
the
jury
and
the
climax
of
his
was
always
accompanied
by
some
dramatic
exhibition
calculated
to
arouse
sympathy
for
his
client
himself
an
adept
at
shedding
tears
at
will
he
seemed
able
to
induce
them
when
needed
in
the
lachrymal
glands
of
the
most
hardened
culprit
whom
he
happened
to
be
defending
wellman
tells
the
story
of
how
he
was
once
prosecuting
a
woman
for
the
murder
of
her
lover
whom
she
had
shot
rather
than
allow
him
to
desert
her
she
was
a
parson
daughter
who
had
gone
wrong
and
there
seemed
little
to
be
said
in
her
behalf
she
sat
at
the
bar
the
picture
of
injured
innocence
with
a
look
of
spirituality
which
she
must
have
conjured
up
from
the
storehouse
of
her
memories
of
her
father
howe
was
rather
an
exquisite
so
far
as
his
personal
habits
were
concerned
and
allowed
his
to
grow
to
an
extraordinary
length
he
had
arranged
that
at
the
climax
of
his
address
to
the
jury
he
would
turn
and
tearing
away
the
slender
hands
of
his
client
from
her
face
challenge
the
jury
to
find
guilt
written
there
wellman
was
totally
unprepared
for
this
and
a
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
when
he
saw
howe
his
face
apparently
surcharged
with
emotion
turn
suddenly
towards
his
client
and
roughly
thrust
away
her
hands
as
he
did
so
he
embedded
his
in
her
cheeks
and
the
girl
uttered
an
involuntary
scream
of
nervous
terror
and
pain
that
made
the
jury
turn
cold
look
gentlemen
look
in
this
poor
creature
face
does
she
look
like
a
guilty
woman
no
a
thousand
times
no
those
are
the
tears
of
innocence
and
shame
send
her
back
to
her
aged
father
to
comfort
his
old
age
let
him
clasp
her
in
his
arms
and
press
his
trembling
lips
to
her
hollow
eyes
let
him
wipe
away
her
tears
and
bid
her
sin
no
more
the
jury
acquitted
and
wellman
aghast
followed
them
downstairs
to
inquire
how
such
a
thing
were
possible
the
jurors
said
that
they
had
agreed
to
disclose
nothing
of
their
deliberations
but
explained
wellman
you
see
in
a
way
i
am
your
attorney
and
i
want
to
know
how
to
do
better
next
time
she
had
offered
to
plead
guilty
if
she
could
get
off
with
twenty
years
the
abashed
jury
slunk
downstairs
in
silence
and
the
secret
of
their
deliberations
remains
as
yet
untold
in
spite
of
such
cases
where
guilty
women
have
been
acquitted
through
maudlin
sentiment
or
in
response
to
popular
clamor
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
than
the
idea
that
few
women
who
are
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
are
made
to
suffer
for
their
offences
thus
although
no
woman
has
suffered
the
death
penalty
in
new
york
county
in
twenty
years
the
average
number
of
convictions
for
crime
is
practically
the
same
for
women
as
for
men
in
proportion
to
the
number
indicted
the
last
unreversed
conviction
of
a
woman
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
was
that
of
chiara
cignarale
in
may
her
sentence
was
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
since
then
thirty
women
have
been
actually
tried
before
juries
for
homicide
with
the
following
results
convicted
of
murder
in
first
degree
acquitted
murder
in
second
degree
manslaughter
in

total
the
percentage
of
convictions
to

is
as
follows

it
is
distinctly
interesting
to
compare
this
with
the
table
showing
the
results
of
all
the
homicide
trials
for
the
past
eight
years
irrespective
of
the
sex
of
the
defendants
convictions

aver
the
reader
will
observe
that
the
percentage
of
convictions
to
acquittals
of
women
defendants
averages
per
cent
greater
than
the
percentage
for
both
sexes
a
more
elaborate
table
would
show
that
where
the
defendants
are
men
there
are
a
greater
proportionate
number
of
acquittals
but
more
verdicts
in
higher
degrees
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
in
the
second
degree
in
the
case
of
a
man
charged
with
murder
is
infrequent
but
convictions
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
are
exceedingly
common
the
reason
for
the
higher
percentage
of
convictions
of
women
is
that
fewer
women
who
commit
crime
are
prosecuted
than
men
and
that
they
are
rarely
indicted
unless
they
are
clearly
guilty
of
the
degree
of
crime
charged
against
them
while
practically
every
man
who
is
charged
with
homicide
and
who
it
seems
may
be
found
guilty
is
indicted
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
the
trial
of
women
for
crime
invariably
arouses
keen
public
interest
and
the
dethronement
of
a
czar
or
the
assassination
of
an
emperor
pales
to
insignificance
before
the
prosecution
of
a
woman
for
murder
some
of
this
interest
is
fictitious
and
stimulated
merely
by
the
yellow
press
but
a
great
deal
of
it
is
genuine
the
writer
remembers
attending
a
dinner
of
judges
and
counsellors
during
the
trial
of
anna
eliza
alias
nan
patterson
where
one
would
have
supposed
that
the
lightest
subject
of
conversation
would
be
not
less
weighty
than
the
constitutionality
of
an
income
tax
and
finding
to
his
astonishment
that
the
only
topic
for
which
they
showed
any
zest
was
whether
nan
would
be
found
guilty
one
of
the
earliest
if
not
the
earliest
record
of
a
woman
being
held
for
murder
is
that
of
agnes
archer
indicted
by
twelve
men
on
april
sworn
before
the
mayor
and
coroner
to
inquire
as
to
the
death
of
alice
colynbourgh
the
quaint
old
report
begins
in
latin
but
the
pleadings
are
set
forth
in
the
language
of
the
day
as
follows
agnes

and

of

town
the
subsequent
history
of
agnes
is
lost
in
obscurity
but
since
she
had
to
procure
but
compurgators
who
were
prepared
to
swear
that
they
believed
her
innocent
and
as
she
was
at
liberty
to
choose
these
herself
from
her
native
village
of
winchelsea
it
is
probable
that
she
escaped
cf
thayer
as
cited
supra
fortunately
the
sight
of
a
woman
save
of
the
very
lowest
class
at
the
bar
of
justice
is
rare
the
number
of
cases
where
women
of
good
environment
appear
as
defendants
in
the
criminal
courts
in
the
course
of
a
year
may
be
numbered
upon
the
fingers
of
a
single
hand
and
although
the
number
of
female
defendants
may
equal
ten
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
males
not
of
the
women
brought
to
the
bar

tricks
of
the
trade
tricks
and
treachery
said
benjamin
franklin
are
the
practice
of
fools
that
have
not
wit
enough
to
be
honest
had
the
kindly
philosopher
been
familiar
with
all
the
exigencies
of
the
criminal
law
he
might
have
added
a
qualification
to
this
somewhat
general
if
indisputably
moral
maxim
though
it
doubtless
remains
true
as
a
guiding
principle
of
life
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
it
would
be
an
unwarrantable
aspersion
upon
the
intellectual
qualities
of
the
members
of
the
criminal
bar
to
say
that
the
tricks
by
virtue
of
which
they
often
get
their
clients
off
are
the
practice
of
fools
on
the
contrary
observation
would
seem
to
indicate
that
in
many
instances
the
wiser
or
at
least
the
more
successful
the
practitioner
of
criminal
law
becomes
the
more
numerous
and
ingenious
become
the
tricks
which
are
his
stock
in
trade
this
must
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
there
are
not
and
conscientious
practitioners
of
criminal
law
many
of
them
financially
successful
some
filled
with
a
noble
humanitarian
purpose
and
some
drawn
to
their
calling
by
a
sincere
enthusiasm
for
the
vocation
of
the
advocate
which
in
these
days
of
business
law
and
commercial
methods
reaches
perhaps
its
highest
form
in
the
criminal
courts
there
are
no
more
tricks
practised
in
these
tribunals
than
in
the
civil
but
they
are
more
ingenious
in
conception
more
lawless
in
character
bolder
in
execution
and
less
shamefaced
in
detection
let
us
not
be
too
hard
upon
our
brethren
of
the
criminal
branch
truly
their
business
is
to
get
their
clients
off
it
is
unquestionably
a
generally
accepted
principle
that
it
is
better
that
guilty
men
should
escape
than
that
one
innocent
man
should
be
convicted
however
much
persons
of
argumentative
or
philosophic
disposition
may
care
to
quarrel
with
this
doctrine
they
must
at
least
admit
that
it
would
doubtless
appear
to
them
of
vital
truth
were
they
defending
some
trembling
client
concerning
whose
guilt
or
innocence
they
were
themselves
somewhat
in
doubt
charity
believeth
all
things
and
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
every
reasonable
doubt
even
from
his
own
lawyer
it
is
the
lawyer
business
to
create
such
a
doubt
if
he
can
and
we
must
not
be
too
censorious
if
in
his
eagerness
to
raise
this
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
he
sometimes
oversteps
the
bounds
of
propriety
appeals
to
popular
prejudices
and
emotions
makes
illogical
deductions
from
the
evidence
and
impugns
the
motives
of
the
prosecution
the
district
attorney
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
handle
the
evidence
in
logical
fashion
and
tear
away
the
flimsy
curtain
of
sentimentality
hoisted
by
the
defence
these
are
hardly
tricks
at
all
but
sometimes
under
the
name
of
advocacy
a
trick
is
turned
which
deserves
a
much
harsher
name
not
long
ago
a
celebrated
case
of
murder
was
moved
for
trial
after
the
defendant
lawyer
had
urged
him
in
vain
to
offer
a
plea
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
a
jury
was
summoned
and
as
is
the
usual
custom
in
such
cases
examined
separately
on
the
voir
dire
as
to
their
fitness
to
serve
the
defendant
was
a
german
and
the
prosecutor
succeeded
in
keeping
all
germans
off
the
jury
until
the
eleventh
seat
was
to
be
filled
when
he
found
his
peremptory
challenges
exhausted
then
the
lawyer
for
the
prisoner
managed
to
slip
in
a
stout
old
teuton
who
replied
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
his
place
of
nativity
the
lawyer
made
a
note
of
it
and
the
box
filled
the
trial
proceeded
with
unwonted
expedition
the
defendant
was
charged
with
having
murdered
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
been
intimate
and
his
guilt
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
was
demonstrated
upon
the
evidence
beyond
peradventure
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
the
defendant
not
having
dared
to
take
the
stand
the
lawyer
arose
to
address
the
jury
in
behalf
of
what
appeared
a
hopeless
cause
even
the
old
german
in
the
back
row
seemed
plunged
in
soporific
inattention
after
a
few
introductory
remarks
the
lawyer
raised
his
voice
and
in
tones
began
in
the
beautiful
county
of
sits
a
woman
old
and
gray
waiting
the
message
of
your
verdict
from
beyond
the
seas
number
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
the
lawyer
as
if
not
quite
sure
of
what
he
had
heard
there
she
sits
continued
the
attorney
in
by
her
cottage
window
waiting
waiting
to
learn
whether
her
boy
is
to
be
returned
to
her
outstretched
arms
number
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
forehead
had
the
woman
who
so
unhappily
met
her
death
at
the
hands
of
my
unfortunate
client
been
like
those
women
of
noble
sweet
pure
lovely
women
of
i
should
have
naught
to
say
to
you
in
his
behalf
number
leaned
forward
and
gazed
searchingly
into
the
lawyer
face
but
alas
no
produces
a
virtue
a
loveliness
a
nobility
of
its
own
number
sat
up
and
proudly
expanded
his
chest
when
after
about
an
hour
or
more
of
the
counsel
surrendered
the
floor
to
the
district
attorney
the
latter
found
it
quite
impossible
to
secure
the
slightest
attention
from
the
eleventh
juror
who
seemed
to
be
spending
his
time
in
casting
compassionate
glances
in
the
direction
of
the
prisoner
in
due
course
the
jury
retired
but
had
no
sooner
reached
their
room
and
closed
the
door
than
the
old
teuton
cried
dot
man
iss
not
guilty
the
other
eleven
wrestled
with
him
in
vain
he
remained
impervious
to
argument
for
seventeen
hours
declining
to
discuss
the
evidence
and
muttering
at
intervals
dot
man
iss
not
guilty
the
other
eleven
stood
unanimously
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
which
was
the
only
logical
verdict
that
could
possibly
have
been
returned
upon
the
evidence
at
last
worn
out
with
their
efforts
they
finally
induced
the
old
teuton
to
compromise
with
them
on
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
wearily
they
straggled
in
the
old
native
of
bringing
up
the
rear
bursting
with
exultation
and
with
victory
in
his
eye
gentlemen
of
the
jury
have
you
agreed
upon
a
verdict
inquired
the
clerk
we
have
replied
the
foreman
how
say
you
do
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
or
not
guilty
guilty
of
manslaughter
returned
the
foreman
feebly
the
district
attorney
was
aghast
at
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice
and
the
judge
showed
plainly
by
his
demeanor
his
opinion
of
such
a
verdict
but
the
old
inhabitant
of
cared
for
this
not
a
whit
the
old
mother
in
might
still
clasp
her
son
in
her
arms
before
she
died
the
defendant
was
arraigned
at
the
bar
then
for
the
first
time
and
to
the
surprise
and
disgust
of
no
he
admitted
in
answer
to
the
questions
of
the
clerk
that
his
parents
were
both
dead
and
that
he
was
born
in
hamburg
a
town
for
whose
inhabitants
the
old
juryman
had
like
others
of
his
compatriots
a
constitutional
antipathy
the
tricks
of
the
trade
as
practised
by
the
astute
and
unscrupulous
criminal
lawyer
vary
with
the
stage
of
the
case
and
the
character
of
the
crime
charged
they
are
also
adapted
with
careful
attention
to
the
disposition
experience
and
capacity
of
the
particular
district
attorney
who
happens
to
be
trying
the
case
against
the
defendant
an
illustration
of
one
of
these
occurred
during
the
prosecution
of
a
bartender
for
selling
spirituous
liquors
without
a
proper
license
he
was
defended
by
an
old
of
the
criminal
bar
famous
for
his
astuteness
and
ability
to
laugh
a
case
out
of
court
the
assistant
district
attorney
who
appeared
against
him
was
a
young
man
recently
appointed
to
office
and
who
was
almost
overcome
at
the
idea
of
trying
a
case
against
so
well
known
a
practitioner
he
had
personally
conducted
but
very
few
cases
had
an
excessive
conception
of
his
own
dignity
and
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
to
appear
ridiculous
everything
except
the
evidence
favored
the
defendant
who
however
was
beyond
every
doubt
guilty
of
the
offence
charged
the
young
assistant
put
in
his
case
calling
his
witnesses
one
by
one
and
examining
them
with
the
most
feverish
anxiety
lest
he
should
forget
something
the
lawyer
for
the
defence
made
no
and
contented
himself
with
smiling
blandly
as
each
witness
left
the
stand
the
youthful
prosecutor
became
more
and
more
nervous
he
was
sure
that
something
was
wrong
but
he
could
just
make
out
what
at
the
conclusion
of
the
people
case
the
lawyer
inquired
with
a
broad
grin
if
that
was
all
the
young
assistant
replied
that
it
was
and
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
quite
enough
let
that
be
noted
by
the
stenographer
remarked
the
lawyer
now
if
your
honors
please
he
continued
addressing
the
three
judges
of
the
special
sessions
you
all
know
how
interested
i
am
to
see
these
young
lawyers
growing
up
i
like
to
help
along
give
a
chance
teach
a
thing
or
two
i
trust
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
for
me
to
say
that
i
like
my
young
friend
here
and
think
he
tried
his
case
very
well
but
he
has
a
great
deal
to
learn
i
always
glad
as
i
said
to
give
the
boys
a
chance
to
give
a
little
experience
i
shall
not
put
my
client
upon
the
stand
it
is
not
necessary
the
fact
is
turning
suddenly
to
the
unfortunate
assistant
district
attorney
my
client
has
a
license
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
folded
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
paralyzed
young
attorney
with
the
harsh
demand
what
do
you
say
to
that
the
assistant
took
the
paper
in
trembling
fingers
and
perused
it
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
unnerved
condition
district
attorney
remarked
the
presiding
justice
dryly
which
did
not
lessen
the
confusion
of
the
young
lawyer
is
this
a
fact
has
the
defendant
a
license
yes
your
honors
replied
the
assistant
this
paper
seems
to
be
a
license
defendant
discharged
remarked
the
court
briefly
the
prisoner
stepped
from
the
bar
and
rapidly
disappeared
though
the
door
of
the
after
enough
time
had
elapsed
to
give
him
a
good
start
and
while
another
case
was
being
called
the
old
lawyer
leaned
over
to
the
assistant
and
remarked
with
a
chuckle
i
am
always
glad
to
give
the
boys
a
chance
help
along
teach
a
little
that
license
was
a
beer
license
before
trial
to
begin
at
the
beginning
whenever
a
person
has
been
arrested
charged
with
crime
and
has
secured
a
criminal
lawyer
to
defend
him
the
first
move
of
the
latter
is
naturally
to
try
and
nip
the
case
in
the
bud
by
inducing
the
complaining
witness
to
abandon
the
prosecution
in
a
vast
number
of
cases
he
is
successful
he
appeals
to
the
charity
of
the
injured
party
quotes
a
little
of
the
scriptures
and
the
golden
rule
pictures
the
destitute
condition
of
the
defendant
family
should
he
be
cast
into
prison
and
the
dragging
of
an
honored
name
in
the
gutter
if
he
should
be
convicted
few
complainants
have
ever
before
appeared
in
a
police
court
and
are
filled
with
repugnance
at
the
rough
treatment
of
prisoners
and
the
suffering
which
they
observe
upon
every
side
after
they
have
seen
the
prisoner
emerge
from
the
cells
pale
bedraggled
and
have
beheld
the
tears
of
his
wife
and
children
as
they
crowd
around
the
husband
and
father
they
begin
to
realize
the
horrible
consequences
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
to
regret
that
they
ever
took
the
steps
which
have
brought
the
where
he
is
the
district
attorney
had
not
yet
taken
up
the
case
the
prosecution
up
to
this
point
is
of
a
private
character
there
are
loud
promises
of
restitution
and
future
good
behavior
from
the
defendant
and
the
occasion
is
ripe
for
the
lawyer
to
urge
the
complainant
to
temper
justice
with
mercy
and
withdraw
before
it
be
too
late
and
the
poor
man
be
ruined
forever
if
the
complainant
is
however
bent
on
bringing
the
defendant
to
justice
and
remains
adamantine
to
the
arguments
of
the
lawyer
and
the
tears
of
the
defendant
family
connections
it
remains
for
the
prisoner
attorney
to
endeavor
to
get
the
case
adjourned
until
matters
can
be
adjusted
to
wit
restitution
made
if
money
has
been
stolen
or
doctors
bills
paid
if
a
head
has
been
cracked
with
perhaps
another
chance
of
pulling
off
the
complainant
and
his
witnesses
failing
in
an
attempt
to
secure
an
adjournment
two
courses
remain
open
first
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
matter
is
a
trivial
one
arising
out
of
petty
spite
is
all
a
mistake
or
that
at
best
it
is
a
case
of
disorderly
conduct
and
thus
induce
the
judge
to
turn
the
case
out
or
inflict
some
trifling
punishment
in
the
shape
of
a
fine
or
second
if
it
be
clear
that
a
real
crime
has
been
committed
to
clamor
for
an
immediate
hearing
in
order
if
it
be
secured
to
subject
the
witnesses
to
a
most
exhaustive
and
thus
get
a
clear
idea
of
just
what
evidence
there
is
against
the
accused
at
the
conclusion
of
the
complainant
case
if
it
appear
reasonably
certain
that
the
magistrate
will
hold
the
prisoner
for
the
action
of
a
superior
court
the
lawyer
will
then
waive
further
examination
or
in
other
words
put
in
no
defence
preferring
the
certainty
of
having
to
face
a
jury
trial
to
affording
in
prosecution
an
opportunity
to
discover
exactly
what
defence
will
be
put
in
and
to
secure
evidence
in
advance
of
the
trial
to
rebut
it
thus
it
rarely
happens
in
criminal
cases
of
importance
that
the
district
attorney
knows
what
the
defence
is
to
be
until
the
defendant
himself
takes
the
stand
and
by
waiving
further
examination
in
the
police
court
the
astute
criminal
attorney
may
select
at
his
leisure
the
defence
best
suited
to
fit
in
with
and
render
nugatory
the
prosecution
evidence
the
writer
has
frequently
been
told
by
the
attorney
for
a
defendant
on
trial
for
crime
that
the
defence
has
not
yet
been
decided
upon
in
fact
such
statements
are
exceedingly
common
in
many
courts
the
attitude
of
all
parties
concerned
seems
to
be
that
the
defendant
will
put
up
a
perjured
defence
so
far
as
his
own
testimony
is
concerned
at
any
rate
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
this
is
hardly
to
be
taken
against
him
on
the
other
hand
if
a
guilty
defendant
has
been
so
badly
advised
as
to
give
his
own
version
of
the
case
before
the
magistrate
in
the
first
instance
it
requires
but
slight
assiduity
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
to
secure
in
the
interval
between
the
hearing
and
the
jury
trial
ample
evidence
to
rebut
it
as
illustrating
merely
the
fertility
and
resourcefulness
of
some
defendants
or
perhaps
their
counsel
the
writer
recalls
a
case
which
he
tried
in
the
year
where
the
defendant
a
druggist
was
charged
with
manslaughter
in
having
caused
the
death
of
an
infant
by
filling
a
doctor
prescription
for
calomel
with
morphine
it
so
happened
that
two
jars
containing
standard
pills
had
been
standing
side
by
side
upon
an
adjacent
shelf
and
a
prescription
for
morphine
having
come
in
at
the
same
time
as
that
for
the
calomel
the
druggist
had
carelessly
filled
the
morphine
prescription
with
calomel
and
the
calomel
prescription
with
morphine
the
adult
for
whom
the
morphine
had
been
prescribed
recovered
immediately
under
the
beneficent
influence
of
the
calomel
but
the
baby
for
whom
the
calomel
had
been
ordered
died
from
the
effects
of
the
first
morphine
pill
administered
all
this
had
occurred
in
five
years
before
the
remainder
of
the
pills
had
disappeared
upon
the
trial
no
inconsistent
contention
having
been
entered
in
the
police
court
the
prisoner
counsel
introduced
six
separate
defences
to
wit
that
the
prescription
had
been
properly
filled
with
calomel
and
that
the
child
had
died
from
natural
causes
the
following
being
suggested
acute
gastritis
acute
nephritis
meningitis
fulminating
meningitis
that
the
child
had
died
of
apomorphine
a
totally
distinct
poison
that
it
had
received
and
taken
calomel
but
that
having
eaten
a
small
piece
of
pickle
shortly
before
the
conjunction
of
the
vegetable
acid
with
the
calomel
had
formed
in
the
child
stomach
a
precipitate
of
corrosive
sublimate
from
which
it
had
died
these
were
all
argued
with
great
learning
during
the
trial
the
box
containing
the
balance
of
the
pills
which
the
defence
contended
were
calomel
unexpectedly
turned
up
it
has
always
been
one
of
the
greatest
regrets
of
the
writer
life
that
he
did
not
then
and
there
challenge
the
defendant
to
eat
one
of
the
pills
and
thus
prove
the
good
faith
of
his
defence
this
was
one
of
the
very
rare
cases
where
a
chemical
analysis
has
been
conducted
in
open
court
the
chemist
first
tested
a
standard
trade
morphine
pill
with
sulphuric
acid
so
that
the
jury
could
personally
observe
the
various
color
reactions
for
themselves
he
then
took
one
of
the
contested
pills
and
subjected
it
to
the
same
test
the
first
pill
had
at
once
turned
to
a
brilliant
rose
but
the
contested
pill
being
antiquated
hung
fire
as
it
were
for
some
seconds
as
nothing
occurred
dismay
made
itself
evident
on
the
face
of
the
prosecutor
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
all
was
lost
then
the
pill
slowly
turned
to
a
faint
brown
changed
to
a
yellowish
red
and
finally
broke
into
an
ardent
rose
the
jury
settled
back
into
their
seats
with
an
audible
ah
and
the
defendant
was
convicted
let
us
return
however
to
that
point
in
the
proceedings
where
the
defendant
has
been
held
for
trial
by
the
magistrate
the
counsel
now
endeavors
to
convince
the
district
attorney
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
and
continues
unremittingly
to
work
upon
the
feelings
of
the
complainant
if
he
finds
that
his
labors
are
likely
to
be
fruitless
in
both
directions
he
may
now
seek
an
opportunity
to
secure
permission
for
his
client
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
explain
away
if
possible
the
charge
against
him
we
will
assume
however
that
in
spite
of
the
assiduity
of
his
lawyer
the
prisoner
has
at
last
been
indicted
and
is
awaiting
trial
what
can
be
done
about
it
of
course
if
the
case
could
be
indefinitely
adjourned
the
complainant
or
his
chief
witness
might
die
or
move
away
to
some
other
jurisdiction
and
if
the
indictment
could
be
the
case
might
die
a
natural
death
of
itself
indictments
however
in
new
york
county
whatever
may
be
the
case
elsewhere
are
no
longer
and
they
can
not
be
adequately
lost
since
certified
copies
are
made
of
each
the
next
step
therefore
is
to
secure
as
long
a
time
as
possible
before
trial
usually
a
prisoner
has
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain
by
delay
and
the
excuses
offered
for
adjournment
are
often
ingenious
in
the
extreme
the
writer
knows
one
criminal
attorney
who
if
driven
to
the
wall
in
the
matter
of
excuses
will
always
serenely
announce
the
death
of
a
near
relative
and
the
obligation
devolving
upon
him
to
attend
the
funeral
another
as
a
last
resort
regularly
is
attacked
in
open
court
by
severe
cramps
in
the
stomach
if
the
court
insists
on
the
trial
proceeding
he
invariably
recovers
of
course
there
are
many
legitimate
reasons
for
adjourning
cases
which
the
prosecution
is
powerless
to
combat
the
most
effective
method
invoked
to
secure
delay
and
one
which
it
is
practically
useless
for
the
district
attorney
to
oppose
is
an
application
to
take
testimony
upon
commission
in
some
distant
place
here
again
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
such
applications
are
often
legitimate
and
proper
and
should
be
granted
in
simple
justice
to
the
defendant
although
this
right
to
take
the
testimony
of
absent
witnesses
is
confined
in
new
york
state
to
the
defendant
and
does
not
extend
to
the
prosecution
and
is
undoubtedly
often
the
subject
of
much
abuse
it
not
infrequently
is
the
cause
of
saving
an
innocent
man
an
example
of
this
was
the
case
of
william
ellis
recently
brought
into
the
public
eye
through
his
connection
with
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
government
and
king
menelik
of
abyssinia
ellis
was
accused
in
by
a
young
woman
of
apparently
excellent
antecedents
and
character
of
a
serious
crime
prior
to
his
indictment
a
colored
man
employed
in
his
office
the
alleged
scene
of
the
crime
disappeared
when
the
case
was
moved
for
trial
ellis
through
his
attorneys
moved
for
a
commission
to
take
the
testimony
of
this
absent
but
clearly
material
witness
in
one
of
the
remote
states
of
mexico
a
proceeding
which
would
require
a
journey
of
some
two
weeks
on
muleback
beyond
the
railway
terminus
the
district
attorney
in
view
of
the
peculiarly
opportune
disappearance
of
this
person
from
the
jurisdiction
strenuously
opposed
the
application
and
hinted
at
collusion
between
ellis
and
the
witness
the
application
however
was
granted
and
a
delay
of
over
a
month
ensued
during
that
time
evidence
was
procured
by
the
counsel
of
the
prisoner
showing
conclusively
that
the
complaining
witness
was
mentally
unsound
and
had
made
similar
and
groundless
charges
against
others
the
indictment
was
at
once
dismissed
but
such
delays
are
not
always
so
righteously
employed
there
is
a
story
told
of
a
case
where
a
notorious
character
was
charged
with
the
unusual
crime
of
mayhem
biting
off
another
man
finger
the
counsel
secured
adjournment
after
adjournment
no
one
knew
why
at
last
the
case
was
moved
for
trial
and
the
prosecution
put
in
its
evidence
clearly
showing
the
guilt
of
the
prisoner
at
the
conclusion
of
the
people
testimony
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
arose
and
harshly
stigmatized
the
story
of
the
complainant
as
a
pack
of
lies
i
will
prove
to
you
in
a
moment
gentlemen
exclaimed
he
to
the
jury
how
absurd
is
this
charge
against
my
innocent
client
take
the
stand
the
prisoner
arose
and
walked
to
the
witnesschair
open
your
mouth
shouted
the
lawyer
the
defendant
did
so
he
had
not
a
tooth
in
his
head
the
delay
had
been
advantageously
employed
the
importance
of
mere
delay
to
a
guilty
defendant
can
not
well
be
overestimated
you
never
can
tell
what
may
happen
to
knock
a
case
on
the
head
for
this
reason
a
sufficiently
paid
and
properly
equipped
counsel
will
run
the
whole
gamut
of
criminal
procedure
and
demur
to
the
indictment
move
for
an
inspection
of
the
minutes
of
the
proceedings
before
the
grand
jury
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
before
that
body
move
for
a
commission
to
take
testimony
move
for
a
change
of
venue
secure
where
possible
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
a
stay
of
proceedings
from
some
federal
judge
on
the
ground
that
his
client
is
confined
without
due
process
of
law
all
these
steps
he
will
take
seriatim
and
some
cases
have
been
delayed
for
as
much
as
two
years
by
merely
invoking
legitimate
legal
processes
in
point
of
fact
it
is
quite
possible
for
any
defendant
absolutely
to
prevent
an
immediate
trial
provided
he
has
the
services
of
vigilant
counsel
for
these
are
not
the
only
proceedings
of
which
he
can
avail
himself
a
totally
distinct
method
is
for
the
defendant
to
secure
bail
and
after
securing
as
many
adjournments
as
possible
simply
flee
the
jurisdiction
he
will
then
remain
away
until
the
case
is
hopelessly
stale
or
he
no
longer
fears
prosecution
in
default
of
all
else
he
may
go
insane
just
before
the
case
is
moved
for
trial
this
habit
of
the
criminal
rich
when
brought
to
book
for
their
misdeeds
is
too
well
known
to
require
comment
all
that
is
necessary
is
for
a
sufficient
number
of
expert
alienists
to
declare
it
to
be
their
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
mentally
incapable
of
understanding
the
proceedings
against
him
or
of
preparing
his
defence
and
he
is
shifted
off
to
a
sanitarium
until
some
new
sensation
occupies
the
public
mind
and
his
offences
are
partially
forgotten
in
this
way
justice
is
often
thwarted
and
the
law
cheated
of
its
victim
but
unless
fortune
favors
him
sooner
or
later
the
indicted
man
must
return
for
trial
and
submit
the
charge
against
him
to
a
jury
but
if
this
happens
even
if
he
be
guilty
all
hope
need
not
be
lost
there
are
still
tricks
of
the
trade
which
may
save
him
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
at
the
trial
what
can
be
done
when
at
last
the
prisoner
who
has
fought
presistently
for
adjournment
has
been
forced
to
face
the
witnesses
against
him
and
submit
the
evidence
to
a
jury
of
peers
let
us
assume
further
that
he
has
been
out
on
bail
with
plenty
of
opportunity
to
prepare
his
defence
and
lay
his
plans
for
escape
when
the
case
is
finally
called
and
the
defendant
takes
his
seat
at
the
bar
after
a
lapse
of
anywhere
from
six
months
to
a
year
or
more
after
his
arrest
the
first
question
for
the
district
attorney
to
investigate
is
whether
or
no
the
person
presenting
himself
for
trial
be
in
point
of
fact
the
individual
mentioned
in
the
indictment
this
is
often
a
difficult
matter
to
determine
ringers
particularly
in
the
magistrates
courts
are
by
no
means
unknown
sometimes
they
appear
even
in
the
higher
courts
if
the
defendant
be
an
or
a
crook
his
photograph
and
measurements
will
speedily
remove
all
doubt
upon
the
subject
but
if
he
be
a
foreigner
particularly
a
pole
italian
or
a
chinaman
or
even
merely
one
of
the
homogeneous
inhabitants
of
the
east
side
of
new
york
it
is
sometimes
a
puzzling
problem
mock
duck
the
celebrated
highbinder
of
chinatown
who
was
set
free
after
two
lengthy
trials
for
murder
was
charged
not
long
ago
with
a
second
assassination
he
was
pointed
out
to
the
police
by
various
chinamen
arrested
and
brought
into
the
criminal
courts
building
for
identification
but
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
matter
of
uncertainty
whether
friends
of
his
masquerading
as
enemies
had
not
surrendered
a
substitute
luckily
the
assistant
district
attorney
who
had
prosecuted
this
wily
and
dangerous
celestial
in
the
first
instance
was
able
to
identify
him
many
years
ago
during
the
days
of
fernando
wood
a
connection
of
his
was
reputed
to
be
the
power
behind
the
policy
business
in
new
york
city
the
predecessor
of
the
notorious
al
adams
a
runner
belonging
to
the
system
having
been
arrested
and
policy
slips
having
been
found
in
his
possession
the
reigning
policy
king
retained
a
lawyer
of
eminent
respectability
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
it
the
defendant
was
a
particularly
valuable
man
in
the
business
and
one
for
whom
his
employer
desired
to
do
everything
in
his
power
the
lawyer
advised
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty
provided
the
judge
could
be
induced
to
let
him
off
with
a
fine
which
the
policy
king
agreed
to
pay
accordingly
the
lawyer
visited
the
judge
in
his
chambers
and
the
latter
practically
promised
to
inflict
only
a
fine
in
case
the
defendant
whom
we
will
call
out
of
consideration
for
his
memory
johnny
dough
should
plead
guilty
unfortunately
for
this
very
satisfactory
arrangement
the
judge
now
long
since
deceased
was
afflicted
with
a
serious
mental
trouble
which
occasionally
manifested
itself
in
peculiar
losses
of
memory
when
johnny
dough
the
policy
king
favorite
was
arraigned
at
the
bar
and
in
answer
to
the
clerk
interrogation
stated
that
he
withdrew
his
plea
of
not
guilty
and
now
stood
ready
to
plead
guilty
the
judge
to
the
surprise
and
consternation
of
the
lawyer
the
defendant
and
the
latter
assembled
friends
turned
upon
him
and
exclaimed
ha
so
you
plead
guilty
do
you
well
i
sentence
you
to
the
penitentiary
for
one
year
you
miserable
scoundrel
utterly
overwhelmed
johnny
dough
was
led
away
while
his
lawyer
and
relatives
retired
to
the
corridor
to
express
their
opinion
of
the
court
about
three
months
later
the
lawyer
who
had
heard
nothing
further
concerning
the
case
happened
to
be
in
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
when
the
latter
looked
up
with
a
smile
and
inquired
well
how
your
dough
safe
on
the
island
i
suppose
replied
the
lawyer
not
a
bit
of
it
returned
the
district
attorney
he
never
went
there
what
do
you
mean
inquired
the
lawyer
i
heard
him
sentenced
to
a
year
myself
i
ca
help
that
said
the
district
attorney
the
other
day
a
workingman
went
down
to
the
island
to
see
his
old
friend
dough
there
was
only
one
dough
on
the
lists
but
when
he
was
produced
the
visitor
exclaimed
johnny
dough
that
ai
him
at
all
at
all
the
visitor
departed
in
disgust
we
instituted
an
investigation
and
found
that
the
man
at
the
island
was
a
you
do
say
cried
the
lawyer
yes
continued
the
district
attorney
but
that
is
not
the
best
part
of
it
you
see
the
says
he
was
to
get
two
hundred
dollars
per
month
for
each
month
of
dough
sentence
which
he
served
the
prison
authorities
have
refused
to
keep
him
any
longer
and
now
he
is
suing
them
for
damages
and
is
trying
to
get
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
compel
them
to
take
him
back
and
let
him
serve
out
the
rest
of
the
sentence
probably
the
most
successful
instance
on
record
of
making
use
of
a
dummy
occurred
in
the
early
stages
of
the
now
famous
divorce
tangle
dodge
had
been
the
first
husband
of
morse
and
from
him
she
had
secured
a
divorce
a
proceeding
to
effect
the
annulment
of
her
second
marriage
had
been
begun
on
the
ground
that
dodge
had
never
been
legally
served
with
the
papers
in
the
original
divorce
case
in
other
words
to
establish
the
fact
that
she
was
still
in
spite
of
her
marriage
to
morse
the
wife
of
dodge
dodge
appeared
in
new
york
and
swore
that
he
had
never
been
served
with
any
papers
a
and
reputable
lawyer
on
the
other
hand
sweetser
was
prepared
to
swear
that
he
had
served
them
personally
upon
dodge
himself
the
matter
was
sent
by
the
court
to
a
referee
at
the
hour
set
for
the
hearing
in
the
referee
office
hummel
and
steinhardt
arrived
early
in
company
with
a
third
person
and
took
their
seats
with
their
backs
to
a
window
on
one
side
of
the
table
at
the
head
of
which
sat
the
referee
and
opposite
fursman
attorney
for
morse
sweetser
was
late
presently
he
appeared
entered
the
office
hurriedly
bowed
to
the
referee
apologized
for
being
tardy
greeted
steinhardt
and
hummel
and
then
turning
to
their
companion
exclaimed
how
do
you
do
mr
dodge
it
was
not
dodge
at
all
but
an
acquaintance
of
one
of
howe
hummel
office
force
who
had
been
asked
to
accommodate
them
nothing
had
been
said
no
representations
had
been
made
and
sweetser
had
voluntarily
walked
into
a
trap
the
attempt
to
induce
witnesses
to
identify
dummies
is
frequently
made
by
both
sides
in
criminal
cases
and
under
certain
circumstances
is
generally
regarded
as
professional
of
course
in
such
instances
no
false
suggestions
are
made
the
witness
himself
being
relied
upon
to
drop
the
fall
in
case
he
does
identify
the
wrong
person
he
has
of
course
invalidated
his
entire
testimony
not
in
one
case
out
of
five
hundred
however
is
any
attempt
made
to
substitute
a
dummy
for
the
real
defendant
the
reason
being
presumably
the
prejudice
innocent
people
have
against
going
to
prison
even
for
a
large
reward
the
question
resolves
itself
therefore
into
how
to
get
the
client
off
when
he
is
actually
on
trial
first
how
can
the
sympathies
of
the
jury
be
enlisted
at
the
very
start
weeping
wives
and
wailing
infants
are
a
drug
on
the
market
it
is
a
friendless
man
indeed
even
if
he
be
a
bachelor
who
can
not
procure
for
the
purposes
of
his
trial
the
services
of
a
temporary
wife
and
miscellaneous
collection
of
children
not
that
he
need
swear
that
they
are
his
they
are
merely
lined
up
along
a
bench
well
to
the
front
of
the
the
imagination
of
the
juryman
does
the
rest
a
defendant
counsel
always
endeavors
to
impress
the
jury
with
the
idea
that
all
he
wants
is
a
fair
open
trial
and
that
he
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
conceal
this
usually
takes
the
form
of
a
loud
announcement
that
he
is
willing
to
take
the
first
twelve
men
who
enter
the
box
inasmuch
as
the
defence
needs
only
to
secure
the
vote
of
one
juryman
to
procure
a
disagreement
this
offer
is
a
comparatively
safe
one
for
the
defendant
to
make
since
the
prosecutor
who
must
secure
unanimity
on
the
part
of
the
jury
at
least
in
new
york
state
can
afford
to
take
no
chances
of
letting
an
incompetent
or
otherwise
unfit
talesman
slip
into
the
box
caution
requires
him
to
examine
the
jury
in
every
important
case
and
frequently
this
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
makes
it
appear
as
if
the
state
had
less
confidence
in
its
case
than
the
defence
this
trick
was
invariably
used
by
the
late
william
howe
in
all
homicide
cases
where
he
appeared
for
the
defence
the
next
step
is
to
slip
some
juryman
into
the
box
who
is
likely
for
any
one
of
a
thousand
reasons
to
lean
toward
the
defence
as
for
example
one
who
is
of
the
same
religion
nationality
or
even
name
as
the
defendant
the
writer
once
tried
a
case
where
the
defendant
was
a
hebrew
named
bauman
charged
with
perjury
abraham
levy
was
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
having
left
an
associate
to
select
the
jury
the
writer
returned
to
the
courtroom
to
find
that
his
friend
had
chosen
for
foreman
a
hebrew
named
abraham
levy
needless
to
say
a
disagreement
of
the
jury
was
the
almost
inevitable
result
the
same
lawyer
not
many
years
ago
defended
a
client
named
abraham
levy
in
like
manner
he
managed
to
get
an
abraham
levy
on
the
jury
and
on
that
occasion
succeeded
in
getting
his
client
off
no
method
is
too
to
be
made
use
of
on
the
chance
of
catching
some
stray
talesman
in
a
case
defended
by
ambrose
hal
purdy
where
the
deceased
had
been
wantonly
stabbed
to
death
by
a
italian
shortly
after
the
assassination
of
president
mckinley
the
defence
was
interposed
that
a
quarrel
had
arisen
between
the
two
men
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
deceased
had
loudly
proclaimed
anarchistic
doctrines
and
openly
gloried
in
the
death
of
the
president
that
the
defendant
had
expostulated
with
him
whereupon
the
deceased
had
violently
attacked
the
prisoner
who
had
killed
him
in
the
whole
thing
was
so
thin
as
to
deceive
nobody
but
purdy
as
each
talesman
took
the
to
be
examined
on
the
voir
dire
solemnly
asked
each
one
pardon
me
for
asking
such
a
question
at
this
time
it
is
only
my
duty
to
my
unfortunate
client
that
impels
me
to
it
but
have
you
any
sympathy
with
anarchy
or
with
assassination
the
talesman
of
course
inevitably
replied
in
the
negative
thank
you
sir
purdy
would
continue
in
that
event
you
are
entirely
acceptable
not
long
ago
two
shrewd
irish
attorneys
were
engaged
in
defending
a
client
charged
with
an
atrocious
murder
the
defendant
had
the
most
hebraic
cast
of
countenance
imaginable
and
a
beard
that
reached
to
his
waist
practically
the
only
question
which
these
lawyers
put
to
the
different
talesmen
during
the
selection
of
the
jury
was
have
you
any
prejudice
against
the
defendant
on
account
of
his
race
in
due
course
they
succeeded
in
getting
several
hebrews
upon
the
jury
who
managed
in
the
to
argue
the
verdict
down
from
murder
to
manslaughter
in
the
second
degree
as
the
defendant
was
being
taken
across
the
bridge
to
the
tombs
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
offered
up
a
heartfelt
prayer
such
as
could
only
have
emanated
from
the
lips
of
a
devout
roman
catholic
lawyers
frequently
secure
the
of
jurors
which
may
last
throughout
the
trial
and
show
itself
in
the
verdict
by
some
happy
remark
during
the
early
stages
of
the
case
during
the
clancy
murder
trial
each
side
exhausted
its
thirty
peremptory
challenges
and
also
the
entire
panel
of
jurors
in
filling
the
box
at
this
stage
of
the
case
the
foreman
became
ill
and
had
to
be
excused
no
jurors
were
left
except
one
who
had
been
excused
by
mutual
consent
for
some
trifling
reason
and
who
out
of
curiosity
had
remained
in
court
he
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
stone
both
sides
then
agreed
to
accept
him
as
foreman
provided
he
was
still
willing
to
serve
and
this
proving
to
be
the
case
he
triumphantly
made
his
way
towards
the
box
as
he
did
so
the
defendant
counsel
remarked
the
stone
which
the
builders
refused
is
become
the
head
stone
of
the
corner
the
generated
by
this
meagre
jest
stood
him
later
in
excellent
stead
in
default
of
any
other
defence
some
criminal
attorneys
have
been
known
to
seek
to
excite
sympathy
for
their
helpless
clients
by
appearing
in
court
so
intoxicated
as
to
be
manifestly
unable
to
take
care
of
the
defendant
interests
and
prisoners
have
frequently
been
acquitted
simply
by
virtue
of
their
lawyer
obvious
incapacity
the
attitude
of
the
jury
in
such
cases
seems
to
be
that
the
defendant
has
not
had
a
fair
show
and
so
should
be
acquitted
anyway
of
course
this
appeals
to
the
juryman
sympathies
and
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
by
his
action
the
prosecution
is
given
no
show
at
all
generally
speaking
the
advice
credited
to
lincoln
as
being
given
by
him
to
a
young
attorney
who
was
about
to
defend
a
presumably
guilty
client
is
religiously
followed
by
all
criminal
practitioners
well
my
boy
if
you
got
a
good
case
stick
to
the
evidence
if
you
got
a
weak
one
go
for
the
people
witnesses
but
if
you
got
no
case
at
all
hammer
the
district
attorney
as
a
rule
however
criminal
lawyers
are
not
in
a
position
to
hammer
the
prosecuting
officer
but
endeavor
instead
to
suggest
by
innuendo
or
even
open
declaration
his
bias
and
unfairness
be
fair
is
the
continual
cry
try
to
be
fair
the
defendant
whether
he
be
an
or
professional
thief
is
always
this
poor
boy
and
as
he
is
not
compelled
by
law
to
testify
and
as
his
failure
to
do
so
must
not
be
weighed
against
him
by
the
jury
he
frequently
walks
out
of
court
a
free
man
because
the
jury
believe
from
the
lawyer
remarks
that
he
is
in
fact
a
mere
youthful
offender
of
hitherto
good
reputation
and
deserves
another
chance
by
all
odds
the
greatest
abuse
in
criminal
trials
lies
in
the
open
disregard
of
professional
ethics
on
the
part
of
lawyers
who
deliberately
supply
of
themselves
in
their
opening
and
closing
addresses
to
the
jury
what
incompetent
bits
of
evidence
true
or
false
they
have
not
been
able
to
establish
by
their
witnesses
there
is
no
complete
cure
for
this
for
even
if
the
judge
rebukes
the
lawyer
and
directs
the
jury
to
disregard
what
he
has
said
as
not
being
in
the
evidence
the
damage
has
been
done
the
statement
still
lingering
in
the
jury
mind
without
any
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
disprove
it
there
is
no
antidote
for
such
a
shyster
lawyer
need
but
to
keep
his
client
off
the
stand
and
he
can
saturate
the
jury
mind
with
any
facts
concerning
the
defendant
respectability
and
history
which
his
imagination
is
powerful
enough
to
supply
on
such
occasions
an
with
no
relatives
may
become
a
noble
fellow
who
rather
than
have
his
family
name
tainted
by
being
connected
with
a
criminal
trial
is
willing
to
risk
even
conviction
a
veteran
of
the
glorious
war
which
knocked
the
shackles
from
the
slave
the
father
of
nine
children
a
man
hounded
by
the
police
the
district
attorney
may
shout
himself
hoarse
the
judge
may
pound
his
gavel
in
righteous
indignation
the
lawyer
may
apologize
because
in
the
zeal
with
which
he
feels
inspired
for
his
client
cause
he
perhaps
which
only
makes
matters
worse
has
overstepped
the
mark
but
some
juryman
may
suppose
that
after
all
the
prisoner
is
a
hero
or
nine
times
a
father
there
is
one
notorious
attorney
who
poses
as
a
philanthropist
and
who
invariably
promises
the
jury
that
if
they
acquit
his
client
he
will
personally
give
him
employment
if
he
has
kept
half
of
his
promises
he
must
by
this
time
have
several
hundred
clerks
gardeners
coachmen
choremen
and
valets
in
like
manner
attorneys
of
this
feather
will
deliberately
state
to
the
jury
that
if
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand
he
would
have
testified
thus
and
so
or
that
if
certain
witnesses
who
have
not
appeared
and
who
perhaps
in
reality
do
not
exist
at
all
had
testified
they
would
have
established
various
facts
such
lawyers
should
be
locked
up
or
disbarred
courts
are
powerless
to
negative
entirely
their
dishonesty
in
individual
cases
clever
counsel
of
course
habitually
make
use
of
all
sorts
of
appeals
to
sympathy
and
prejudice
in
one
case
in
new
york
in
which
james
osborne
appeared
as
prosecutor
the
defendant
wore
a
button
his
lawyer
managed
to
get
a
veteran
on
the
jury
osborne
is
a
native
of
north
carolina
the
defendant
counsel
to
use
his
own
words
worked
the
war
for
all
it
was
worth
and
the
defendant
lived
bled
and
died
for
his
country
and
over
and
over
again
in
summing
up
the
case
the
attorney
addressed
himself
particularly
to
the
veteran
on
the
back
row
and
after
referring
to
numerous
imaginary
engagements
exclaimed
why
gentlemen
my
client
was
pouring
out
his
life
blood
upon
the
field
of
battle
when
the
ancestors
of
osborne
were
raising
their
hands
against
the
flag
for
once
osborne
had
no
adequate
words
to
reply
by
far
the
most
effective
and
dangerous
trick
employed
by
guilty
defendants
is
the
deliberate
shouldering
of
the
entire
blame
by
one
of
two
persons
who
are
indicted
together
for
a
single
offence
a
common
example
of
this
is
where
two
men
are
caught
at
the
same
time
bearing
away
between
them
the
spoil
of
their
crime
and
are
jointly
indicted
for
criminally
receiving
stolen
property
both
probably
are
side
partners
equally
guilty
and
have
burglarized
some
house
or
store
in
each
other
company
they
maybe
old
pals
and
often
have
served
time
together
they
agree
to
demand
separate
trials
and
that
whoever
is
convicted
first
shall
assume
the
entire
responsibility
accordingly
is
tried
and
in
spite
of
his
asseveration
that
he
is
innocent
and
that
the
stuff
was
given
him
by
a
strange
man
who
paid
him
a
dollar
to
transport
it
to
a
certain
place
is
properly
convicted
the
bargain
holds
b
case
is
moved
for
trial
and
he
claims
never
to
have
seen
in
his
life
before
the
night
in
question
and
that
he
volunteered
to
help
the
latter
carry
a
bundle
which
seemed
to
be
too
heavy
for
him
he
calls
who
testifies
that
this
is
so
that
whom
he
did
not
know
from
adam
tendered
his
services
and
that
he
availed
himself
of
the
offer
the
jury
are
usually
prone
to
acquit
as
the
weight
of
evidence
is
clearly
with
the
defendant
the
defence
that
the
accused
innocently
received
the
stolen
property
into
his
possession
was
a
familiar
one
even
in
as
appears
by
the
following
record
taken
from
the
minutes
of
the
sessions
it
would
seem
that
it
was
even
then
received
with
some
incredulity

one

pursued

found

that

but
upon

manifestly
appeareth
to

that
the

from
whence
he
sett
out
and
that
he
afterwards
stand
committed

sheriffs
custody
till
he
pay
his
fees
many
changes
are
rung
upon
this
device
there
is
said
to
have
been
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
sentenced
to
be
executed
it
was
one
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
the
verdict
was
the
result
of
hours
of
deliberation
on
the
part
of
the
jury
the
prisoner
had
stoutly
denied
knowing
anything
of
the
homicide
shortly
before
the
date
set
for
the
execution
another
man
turned
up
who
admitted
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
and
made
the
fullest
sort
of
a
confession
a
new
trial
was
thereupon
granted
by
the
appellate
court
and
the
convict
on
the
application
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
discharged
and
quickly
made
himself
scarce
it
then
developed
that
apart
from
the
prisoner
own
confession
there
was
practically
nothing
to
connect
him
with
the
crime
under
a
statute
making
such
evidence
obligatory
in
order
to
render
a
confession
sufficient
for
a
conviction
the
prisoner
had
to
be
discharged
in
the
case
of
mabel
parker
a
young
woman
of
twenty
charged
with
the
forgery
of
a
large
number
of
checks
many
of
them
for
substantial
amounts
her
husband
made
an
almost
successful
attempt
to
procure
her
acquittal
by
means
of
a
new
variation
of
the
old
game
parker
after
her
husband
had
been
arrested
for
passing
one
of
the
bogus
checks
had
been
duped
by
a
detective
into
believing
that
the
latter
was
a
fellow
criminal
who
was
interested
in
securing
parker
release
in
due
course
she
took
this
supposed
friend
into
her
confidence
made
a
complete
confession
and
illustrated
her
skill
by
impromptu
copies
of
her
forgeries
from
memory
upon
a
sheet
of
pad
paper
this
the
detective
secured
and
then
arrested
her
she
was
indicted
for
forging
the
name
alice
kauser
to
a
check
upon
the
lincoln
national
bank
on
her
trial
she
denied
having
done
so
and
claimed
that
the
detective
had
found
the
sheet
containing
her
supposed
handwriting
in
her
husband
desk
and
that
she
had
written
none
of
the
alleged
copies
upon
it
the
door
of
the
courtroom
then
opened
and
james
parker
was
led
to
the
bar
and
pleaded
guilty
to
the
forgery
of
the
check
in
question
for
the
benefit
of
the
layman
it
should
be
explained
that
as
a
rule
indictments
for
forgery
also
contain
a
count
for
uttering
he
then
took
the
stand
admitted
that
he
had
not
only
uttered
but
had
also
written
the
check
and
swore
that
it
was
his
handwriting
which
appeared
on
the
pad
the
prosecutor
was
nonplussed
if
he
should
ask
the
witness
to
prove
his
capacity
to
forge
such
a
check
from
memory
on
the
the
latter
as
he
had
ample
time
to
practise
the
signature
while
in
prison
would
probably
succeed
in
doing
so
if
on
the
other
hand
he
should
not
ask
him
to
write
the
name
the
defendant
counsel
would
argue
to
the
jury
that
he
was
afraid
to
do
so
the
district
attorney
therefore
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
challenged
parker
to
make
from
memory
a
copy
of
the
signature
and
much
as
he
had
suspected
the
witness
produced
a
very
good
one
an
acquittal
seemed
certain
and
the
prosecutor
was
at
his
wit
end
to
devise
a
means
to
meet
this
practical
demonstration
that
the
husband
was
in
fact
the
forger
at
last
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
to
memorize
such
a
signature
and
acting
on
this
hint
he
found
that
after
half
an
hour
practice
he
was
able
to
make
almost
as
good
a
forgery
as
parker
when
therefore
it
came
time
for
him
to
address
the
jury
he
pointed
out
the
fact
that
performance
on
the
really
established
nothing
at
all
that
any
one
could
forge
such
a
signature
from
memory
after
but
a
few
minutes
practice
to
prove
to
you
how
easily
this
can
be
done
said
he
i
will
volunteer
to
write
a
better
kauser
signature
than
parker
did
he
thereupon
seized
a
pen
and
began
to
demonstrate
his
ability
to
do
so
parker
seeing
the
force
of
this
ocular
demonstration
grasped
her
counsel
arm
and
cried
out
for
god
sake
do
let
him
do
it
the
lawyer
objected
the
objection
was
sustained
but
the
case
was
saved
why
the
jury
argued
should
the
lawyer
object
unless
the
making
of
such
a
forgery
were
in
fact
an
easy
matter
in
desperate
cases
desperate
men
will
take
desperate
chances
the
traditional
instance
where
the
lawyer
defending
a
client
charged
with
causing
the
death
of
another
by
administering
poisoned
cake
met
the
evidence
of
the
prosecution
experts
with
the
remark
this
is
my
answer
to
their
testimony
and
calmly
ate
the
balance
of
the
cake
is
too
familiar
to
warrant
detailed
repetition
the
jury
retired
to
the
and
the
lawyer
to
his
office
where
a
stomach
pump
quickly
put
him
out
of
danger
the
jury
is
supposed
to
have
acquitted
such
are
some
of
the
tricks
of
the
legal
trade
as
practised
in
its
criminal
branch
most
of
them
are
unsuccessful
and
serve
only
to
relieve
the
gray
monotony
of
the
courts
when
they
achieve
their
object
they
add
to
the
interest
of
the
profession
and
teach
the
prosecutor
a
lesson
by
which
perhaps
he
may
profit
in
the
future
chapter
ix
what
fosters
crime
to
lack
of
regard
for
law
is
mainly
due
the
existence
of
crime
for
a
perfect
respect
for
law
would
involve
entire
obedience
to
it
yet
crime
continues
and
from
time
to
time
breaks
forth
to
such
an
extent
as
to
give
ground
for
a
popular
impression
that
it
is
increasing
out
of
proportion
to
our
growth
as
a
nation
now
while
it
may
be
fairly
questioned
whether
there
is
any
actual
increase
of
crime
in
the
united
states
and
while
on
the
contrary
observation
would
seem
to
show
an
actual
decrease
not
only
in
crimes
of
violence
but
in
all
major
crimes
there
nevertheless
exists
a
widespread
contempt
for
the
criminal
law
which
if
it
has
not
already
stimulated
a
general
increase
of
criminal
activity
is
likely
to
do
so
in
the
future
this
contempt
for
the
law
is
founded
not
only
upon
actual
conditions
but
also
upon
belief
in
conditions
erroneously
supposed
to
exist
which
is
fostered
by
current
literature
and
by
the
sensational
press
thus
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
while
it
is
popularly
believed
that
women
are
almost
never
convicted
of
crime
and
particularly
of
homicide
the
fact
is
at
least
in
new
york
county
that
a
much
greater
proportion
of
women
charged
with
murder
are
convicted
than
of
men
charged
with
the
same
offence
to
read
the
newspapers
one
would
suppose
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
defendant
was
a
female
instantly
paralyzed
the
minds
of
the
jury
and
reduced
them
to
a
state
of
imbecility
the
inevitable
result
of
this
must
be
to
encourage
lawlessness
among
the
lower
orders
of
women
and
to
lead
them
to
look
upon
arrest
as
a
mere
formality
without
ultimate
significance
the
writer
recalls
trying
for
murder
a
negress
who
had
shot
her
lover
not
long
after
the
discharge
of
a
notorious
female
defendant
in
a
recent
spectacular
trial
in
new
york
when
asked
why
she
had
killed
him
she
replied
oh
nan
patterson
did
it
and
got
off
this
is
not
offered
as
a
reflection
upon
the
failure
of
the
jury
to
reach
a
verdict
in
the
patterson
case
but
as
an
illuminating
illustration
of
the
concrete
and
immediate
effect
of
all
actual
or
supposed
failures
of
justice
a
belief
that
the
course
of
criminal
justice
is
slow
and
uncertain
that
the
chances
are
all
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
that
he
has
but
to
resort
to
technicalities
to
secure
not
only
indefinite
delay
but
generally
ultimate
freedom
breeds
an
indifference
amounting
almost
to
arrogance
among
powerful
and
otherwise
and
a
painful
yet
hopeless
conviction
among
honest
men
that
nothing
can
prevent
the
wicked
from
flourishing
honesty
seems
no
longer
even
a
good
policy
and
the
young
business
man
resorts
to
sharp
practices
to
get
ahead
of
his
unscrupulous
competitor
in
some
localities
the
uncertainty
and
delay
attendant
upon
the
execution
of
the
law
is
the
alleged
and
maybe
the
actual
cause
of
the
community
crime
of
lynching
even
where
the
administration
of
justice
is
seen
at
its
best
many
people
who
have
been
wronged
believe
that
there
is
so
little
likelihood
that
the
offender
will
after
all
be
punished
that
the
cheapest
and
easiest
course
is
to
let
the
matter
drop
all
this
gives
aid
and
comfort
to
the
powers
of
darkness
the
widespread
impression
as
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
law
is
not
entirely
a
misapprehension
we
have
long
since
passed
the
period
when
it
is
possible
to
punish
an
innocent
man
we
are
now
struggling
with
the
problem
whether
it
is
any
longer
possible
to
punish
the
guilty
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
at
the
present
time
penal
statutes
and
procedure
tend
more
to
defeat
and
retard
the
ends
of
justice
than
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
accused
the
subject
of
reform
is
too
extensive
to
be
discussed
here
even
superficially
but
historically
the
explanation
of
existing
conditions
is
simple
enough
the
present
overgrown
state
of
the
criminal
law
is
the
direct
result
of
our
exaggerated
regard
for
personal
liberty
coupled
with
a
wholesale
adoption
of
the
technicalities
of
english
law
invented
when
only
such
technicalities
could
stand
between
the
minor
offender
and
the
barbarous
punishments
of
a
bygone
age
we
forget
that
the
community
is
composed
of
individuals
and
we
tend
to
disregard
its
interests
for
those
of
any
particular
individual
who
happens
to
be
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
we
revolted
from
england
and
incidentally
from
her
system
of
administering
the
criminal
law
by
which
the
defendant
could
have
no
voice
at
his
own
trial
where
practically
every
crime
was
punishable
with
death
and
where
only
the
crown
could
produce
and
examine
witnesses
every
one
will
have
to
agree
that
the
english
system
was
very
harsh
and
very
unfair
indeed
it
is
better
than
ours
simply
because
its
errors
have
been
systematically
and
wisely
corrected
without
diminution
in
the
national
respect
for
law
when
we
devised
our
own
system
we
adopted
those
humane
expedients
for
evading
the
law
which
were
only
justified
by
the
existing
penalties
attached
to
convictions
for
crime
and
then
discarded
the
penalties
we
were
through
with
tyrants
once
and
for
all
the
crown
had
always
been
opposed
to
the
defendant
and
the
crown
was
a
tyrant
we
naturally
turned
with
sympathy
towards
the
prisoner
we
gave
him
the
right
of
appeal
on
all
matters
of
law
through
all
the
courts
of
our
states
and
even
into
the
courts
of
the
united
states
while
we
allowed
the
people
no
right
of
appeal
at
all
if
the
prisoner
was
convicted
he
could
go
on
and
test
the
case
all
along
the
line
if
he
was
acquitted
the
people
had
to
rest
satisfied
we
stopped
the
mouth
of
the
judge
and
made
it
illegal
for
him
to
sum
up
the
case
or
discuss
the
facts
to
any
extent
we
clipped
the
wings
of
the
prosecutor
and
allowed
him
less
latitude
of
expression
than
an
english
judge
then
we
gazed
on
the
work
of
our
intellects
and
said
it
was
good
if
an
ignorant
jury
acquitted
a
murderer
under
the
eyes
of
a
gagged
and
helpless
judge
we
said
that
it
was
all
right
and
that
it
was
better
that
guilty
men
should
escape
than
that
one
innocent
man
should
be
convicted
yes
better
for
whom
if
another
murderer
about
whose
guilt
the
highest
court
in
one
of
the
states
said
there
was
no
possible
doubt
secured
three
new
trials
and
was
finally
acquitted
on
the
fourth
it
merely
demonstrated
how
perfectly
we
safeguarded
the
rights
of
the
individual
the
result
is
that
we
have
unnecessarily
fettered
ourselves
have
furnished
a
multitude
of
technical
avenues
of
escape
to
and
have
created
a
popular
contempt
for
courts
of
justice
which
shows
itself
in
the
sentimental
and
careless
verdicts
of
juries
in
a
lack
of
public
spirit
and
in
an
indisposition
to

the
impression
sought
to
be
conveyed
by
the
yellow
press
that
our
judiciary
is
corrupt
and
that
money
can
buy
anything
even
justice
leads
the
jury
in
many
cases
to
feel
that
their
presence
is
merely
a
formal
concession
to
an
archaic
procedure
and
that
their
oaths
have
no

the

the
people
have
a
sufficiently
hard
task
to
secure
justice
at
any
criminal
trial
on
the

the
abstract
proposition
that
the

always
an
object
of

he
is

he
has
the

to
make
his

to
have
the

of
the

can
secure
to

their
emotions

if
the

stigmatized
as
and
as

guilty
defendant

the
vision
of
a
liberated
prisoner
rejoicing
in
his
freedom
hovers
in
the
talesman

so
far
so
good
we
can
afford
to
stand
by
a
system
which
in
the
long
run
has
served
us
fairly
well
but
an
occasional
evil
an
evil
which
when
it
occurs
is
productive
of
great
harm
and
serves
to
give
color
to
the
popular
opinion
of
criminal
law
begins
only
when
the
lawyers
have
had
their
opportunity
for
elocution
at
the
conclusion
of
the
charge
the
defendant
attorney
proceeds
to
put
the
judge
through
what
is
familiarly
known
as
a
course
of
sprouts
he
makes
twenty
or
thirty
requests
to
charge
the
jury
on
the
most
abstract
propositions
of
law
which
his
fertile
mind
can
devise
relevant
or
irrelevant
applicable
or
inapplicable
to
the
facts
and
the
judge
is
compelled
to
decide
from
the
bench
without
opportunity
for
reflection
questions
which
the
attorney
has
labored
upon
perchance
for
weeks
if
he
guesses
wrong
the
lawyer
excepts
and
the
case
may
be
reversed
on
appeal
this
is
not
a
test
of
the
defendant
guilt
or
innocence
but
a
test
of
the
abstract
learning
and
quickness
of
the
presiding
judge
it
is
generally
believed
that
appellate
courts
are
prone
to
reverse
criminal
cases
on
purely
technical
grounds
whether
this
belief
be
well
founded
or
ill
its
wide
acceptance
as
fact
is
fertile
in
bringing
the
law
into
disrepute
justice
to
be
effective
must
be

the

a

but
it
is
far
from
being
so
in
states
of
the
character
of
new
york
and
massachusetts
the
appellate
division
first
department
and
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
are
distinctly
opposed
to
reversing
criminal
cases
on
technical
grounds
and
are
prone
to
disregard
trivial
error
where
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
is
clear
the
writer
can
recall
no
recent
criminal
case
where
the
district
attorney
office
has
felt
aggrieved
at
the
action
of
the
higher
courts
and
on
the
contrary
believes
that
their
action
is
generally
based
on
broad
principles
of
public
policy
and
during
the
year
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
defended
appeals
from
convictions
in
criminal
cases
in
the
appellate
division
of
these
convictions
only
three
were
reversed
he
defended
eighteen
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
which
only
two
were
reversed
one
of
the
writer
associates
computed
that
he
had
secured
during
a
four
years
term
of
office
convictions
in
which
appeals
had
been
taken
of
these
but
two
were
reversed
one
of
them
immediately
resulting
in
the
defendant
for
the
same
crime
the
other
is
still
pending
and
the
defendant
awaiting
his
trial
certainly
there
is
little
in
the
actual
figures
to
give
color
to
the
impression
that
the
criminal
profits
by
mere
technicalities
on
appeal
at
least
in
new
york
state
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
reversal
of
a
conviction
in
a
criminal
case
is
due
to
the
carelessness
or
inefficiency
of
the
prosecuting
officer
or
trial
judge
and
not
to
any
inadequacy
in
our
methods
of
procedure
yet
the
tenth
case
the
case
where
the
criminal
does
beat
the
law
by
a
technicality
does
more
harm
than
can
easily
be
estimated
that
is
the
one
case
everybody
knows
about
the
one
the
papers
descant
upon
the
one
that
cheers
the
heart
of
the
grafter
and
every
criminal
who
can
afford
to
pay
a
lawyer
yet
the
evil
influence
of
the
reversal
of
a
conviction
on
appeal
however
much
it
is
to
be
deprecated
is
as
nothing
compared
with
a
deliberate
acquittal
of
a
guilty
defendant
by
a
reckless
sentimental
or
lawless
jury
few
can
appreciate
as
does
a
prosecutor
the
actual
practical
and
immediate
effect
of
such
a
spectacle
upon
those
who
witness
it
two
men
were
seen
to
enter
an
empty
in
the
dead
of
night
the
alarm
was
given
by
a
watchman
near
by
and
a
young
police
officer
who
had
been
but
seven
months
on
the
force
bravely
entered
the
black
and
deserted
building
searched
it
from
roof
to
cellar
and
found
the
marauders
locked
in
one
of
the
rooms
he
called
upon
them
to
open
received
no
reply
yet
without
hesitation
and
without
knowing
what
the
consequences
to
himself
might
be
smashed
in
the
door
and
apprehended
the
two
men
one
was
found
with
a
large
bundle
of
skeleton
keys
in
his
pocket
and
several
candles
while
a
partially
consumed
candle
lay
upon
the
floor
in
the
police
court
they
pleaded
guilty
to
a
charge
of
burglary
and
were
promptly
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
at
the
trial
they
claimed
to
have
gone
into
the
house
to
sleep
said
they
had
found
the
bunch
of
keys
on
the
stairs
denied
having
the
candles
at
all
or
that
they
were
in
a
room
on
the
top
story
and
asserted
that
they
were
in
the
entrance
hall
when
arrested
the
story
told
by
the
defendants
was
so
utterly
ridiculous
that
one
of
the
two
could
not
control
a
grin
while
giving
his
version
of
it
on
the
witness
stand
the
writer
who
prosecuted
the
case
regarded
the
trial
as
a
mere
formality
and
hardly
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
sum
up
the
evidence
at
all
imagine
his
surprise
when
an
jury
acquitted
both
the
defendants
after
practically
no
deliberation
both
had
offered
to
plead
guilty
to
a
slightly
lower
degree
of
crime
before
the
case
was
moved
for
trial
these
two
defendants
who
were
neither
insane
nor
degenerates
consorted
with
others
in
bowery
hotels
and
saloons
incubators
of
crime
what
effect
could
such
a
performance
have
upon
them
and
their
friends
save
to
inculcate
a
belief
that
they
were
licensed
to
commit
as
many
burglaries
as
they
chose
they
had
a
practical
demonstration
that
the
law
was
no
good
and
the
system
a
failure
if
they
could
beat
a
case
in
which
they
had
already
pleaded
guilty
what
could
they
not
do
where
the
evidence
was
less
obvious
they
were
henceforth
immune
who
shall
say
how
many
embryonic
took
courage
at
the
story
and
started
upon
an
experimental
attempt
at
crime
the
news
of
such
an
acquittal
must
instantly
have
been
carried
to
the
tombs
where
every
other
guilty
prisoner
took
heart
and
prepared
anew
his
defence
those
about
to
plead
guilty
and
throw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
court
abandoned
their
honest
purpose
and
devised
some
perjury
instead
criminals
almost
persuaded
that
honesty
was
the
best
policy
changed
their
minds
the
barometer
of
crime
swung
its
needle
from
stormy
to
fair
but
apart
from
the
consider
the
effect
of
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice
upon
a
young
honest
and
zealous
officer
first
all
his
good
work
his
bravery
his
conscientious
effort
at
safeguarding
the
sleeping
public
had
been
disregarded
tossed
aside
with
a
sneer
and
had
gone
for
naught
the
jury
had
stamped
his
story
as
a
lie
and
stigmatized
him
by
their
action
as
a
perjurer
they
had
chosen
two
professional
criminals
as
better
men
his
whole
conduct
of
the
case
instead
of
being
commended
as
meritorious
had
resulted
in
a
solemn
public
declaration
that
he
was
not
worthy
of
credence
and
that
he
had
attempted
wilfully
to
railroad
to
state
prison
two
innocent
men
in
other
words
that
he
ought
to
be
there
himself
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
do
good
work
any
longer
he
might
just
as
well
loiter
in
an
area
on
a
barrel
and
smoke
a
furtive
cigar
when
he
ought
to
be
on
post
perhaps
he
might
better
stand
in
with
those
who
would
inevitably
be
preferred
to
him
by
a
jury
of
their
peers
what
must
have
been
the
effect
on
the
court
officers
the
witnesses
the
defendants
out
on
bail
the
complainants
the
spectators
that
the
whole
business
was
nonsense
and
rot
that
the
jury
system
was
ridiculous
that
the
jurymen
were
either
crooks
or
fools
that
the
only
people
who
were
not
insulted
and
sneered
at
were
the
lawbreakers
themselves
that
if
two
such
rogues
were
to
be
set
free
all
the
other
jailbirds
might
as
well
be
let
go
that
an
honest
man
could
whistle
for
his
justice
and
might
better
straightway
put
on
his
hat
and
go
home
that
the
only
way
to
punish
a
criminal
was
to
punish
him
yourself
kill
him
if
you
got
the
chance
or
get
the
crowd
to
lynch
him
that
if
a
thief
stole
from
you
the
shrewdest
thing
to
do
was
to
induce
him
as
a
to
give
you
the
proceeds
of
his
next
thieving
that
it
was
humiliating
to
live
in
a
town
where
a
rascal
could
snap
his
fingers
at
the
law
and
go
unwhipped
of
justice
the
jury
action
must
have
been
due
either
to
a
wilful
disregard
of
their
oath
or
an
entire
misconception
of
it
assuming
that
the
jury
deliberately
declined
to
obey
the
law
the
whole
twelve
elected
to
become
and
thereby
did
become
lawbreakers
they
disqualified
themselves
forever
as
talesmen
no
prosecutor
in
his
senses
would
move
a
case
before
a
jury
which
numbered
any
one
of
them
they
had
arraigned
themselves
upon
the
side
and
under
the
standard
of
crime
they
became
accessories
after
the
fact
if
on
the
other
hand
they
misconceived
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
there
the
performance
was
a
shocking
example
of
what
is
possible
under
present
conditions
just
as
there
are
three
general
classes
of
wrongs
so
there
are
three
general
and
varyingly
effective
forms
of
restraint
against
their
perpetration
first
there
is
the
moral
control
exerted
by
what
is
ordinarily
called
conscience
secondly
there
is
the
restraint
which
arises
out
of
the
apprehension
that
the
commission
of
a
tort
will
be
followed
by
a
judgment
for
damages
in
a
civil
court
and
lastly
there
is
the
restraint
imposed
by
the
criminal
law
all
these
play
their
part
separately
or
in
conjunction
for
some
men
conscience
is
a
sufficient
barrier
to
crime
or
to
those
acts
which
while
equally
reprehensible
are
not
technically
criminal
for
others
the
possibility
of
pecuniary
loss
is
enough
to
keep
them
in
the
straight
and
narrow
way
but
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
community
the
fear
of
criminal
prosecution
with
implied
disgrace
and
ignominy
forfeiture
of
citizenship
and
confinement
in
a
common
jail
is
about
the
only
conclusive
reason
for
doing
unto
others
as
they
would
the
others
should
do
unto
them
were
the
criminal
law
done
away
with
in
our
present
state
of
civilization
religion
ethics
and
civil
procedure
would
be
absolutely
inefficacious
to
prevent
anarchy
it
is
as
imperative
to
the
ordinary
citizen
to
know
that
if
he
steals
he
will
be
locked
up
as
it
is
for
the
child
to
know
that
if
he
puts
his
hand
into
the
fire
it
will
be
burned
the
acquittal
of
every
thief
breeds
another
and
the
unpunished
murder
is
an
incentive
for
a
dozen
similar
homicides
crimes
are
either
deliberate
or
the
result
of
accident
or
impulse
the
last
class
may
rise
to
a
high
degree
of
enormity
such
as
manslaughter
but
these
crimes
are
rarely
possible
of
restraint
the
perpetrator
does
not
stop
to
consider
even
if
he
be
sober
enough
to
think
at
all
whether
his
act
be
moral
whether
it
will
entail
any
civil
liability
or
what
will
be
its
consequences
if
it
be
a
crime
so
far
as
such
acts
are
concerned
those
who
commit
them
are
hardly
criminals
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
no
influence
in
the
world
is
able
to
prevent
them
the
question
is
how
far
these
different
kinds
of
restraint
operate
upon
the
community
as
a
whole
in
the
prevention
of
deliberate
crime
clearly
the
fear
of
pecuniary
loss
through
actions
brought
to
judgment
in
the
civil
courts
is
practically
nil
most
persons
who
set
out
to
commit
crime
have
no
bank
account
the
absence
of
one
being
generally
what
leads
them
into
a
criminal
career
the
writer
has
no
intention
of
attempting
to
discuss
or
estimate
the
efficacy
of
religion
or
ethics
as
restraining
influences
a
certain
limited
proportion
of
the
community
would
not
commit
crime
under
any
circumstances
it
is
enough
for
them
that
the
act
is
forbidden
by
the
state
even
if
it
be
not
really
wrong
from
their
own
personal
point
of
view
side
by
side
with
these
very
good
people
are
a
very
large
number
who
wear
just
as
fashionable
clothing
have
the
same
friends
attend
the
same
churches
but
who
would
commit
almost
any
crime
so
long
as
they
were
sure
of
not
being
caught
if
we
had
no
criminal
law
we
should
soon
discover
who
were
the
hypocrites
but
for
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
community
something
more
practical
than
either
religion
ethics
or
philosophy
is
necessary
to
keep
them
in
order
they
must
be
convinced
that
the
transgressor
will
surely
be
punished
not
some
time
not
next
year
or
the
year
after
but
now
not
moreover
that
his
way
will
be
merely
hard
but
that
he
will
be
put
in
stripes
and
made
to
break
stones
hence
the
necessity
for
a
vigorous
and
adequate
criminal
law
and
procedure
which
shall
command
the
respect
and
loyalty
of
the
community
administered
by
a
fearless
judiciary
who
will
hold
jurors
to
a
rigid
and
conscientious
obedience
to
their
oath
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
an
archaic
criminal
procedure
which
in
some
respects
is
less
devised
for
the
protection
of
the
community
than
for
the
exculpation
of
the
guilty
the
portals
of
liberty
would
not
fall
down
or
the
framers
of
the
constitution
turn
in
their
graves
if
the
peremptory
challenges
allowed
to
both
sides
in
the
selection
of
a
jury
were
reduced
to
a
reasonable
number
or
if
persons
found
guilty
of
crime
after
due
process
of
law
were
compelled
to
stay
in
jail
until
their
appeals
were
decided
instead
of
walking
the
streets
free
as
air
under
a
certificate
of
reasonable
doubt
issued
by
some
judge
who
personally
knew
nothing
of
the
actual
trial
of
the
case
as
things
stand
a
thief
caught
in
the
very
act
of
picking
a
pocket
in
the
may
challenge
arbitrarily
the
twenty
most
intelligent
talesmen
called
to
sit
as
jurors
in
his
case
does
such
a
practice
make
for
justice
it
is
even
possible
that
the
sacred
bird
of
liberty
would
not
scream
if
eleven
jurors
instead
of
twelve
were
permitted
to
convict
a
defendant
or
set
him
free
while
the
question
of
how
far
the
right

by

are
of

moment
in
contrast
to
that
most
crying
of
all
present
abuses
the
domination
of
the
by
the
press
it
is
no
fiction
to
say
that
in
many
cases
the
actual
trial
is
conducted
in
the
columns
of
yellow
journals
and
the
defendant
acquitted
or
convicted
purely
in

with
an
editorial
policy
judges

caricatured

flouted

contempt
of

to
the

matters

outside

as
what
certain
witnesses
of
either
side
could
establish
were
they
available
the
real
past
and
character
of
the
defendant
etc
the
new
york
courts
under
the
present
statute
are
powerless
to
prevent
this
abuse
in
massachusetts
half
a
dozen
of
our
principal
editors
and
special
writers
would
have
been
locked
up
long
ago
to
the
betterment
of
the
community
and
to
the
increase
of
respect
for
our
courts
of
justice
each
state
has
its
own
particular
problem
to
face
but
ultimately
the
question
is
a
national
one
lack
of
respect
for
law
is
characteristic
of
the
american
people
as
a
whole
until
we
acquire
a
vastly
increased
sense
of
civic
duty
we
should
not
complain
that
crime
is
increasing
or
the
law
ineffective
it
would
be
a
most
excellent
thing
for
an
association
of
our
leading
citizens
to
interest
itself
in
reform
and
demand
and
secure
the
passage
of
new
and
effective
legislation
but
it
would
accomplish
little
if
its
individual
members
continued
to
evade
jury
service
and
left
their
most
important
duty
to
those
least
qualified
by
education
or
experience
to
perform
it
would
serve
some
of
this
class
of
reformers
right
if
one
day
when
after
a
of
evasion
they
perchance
came
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
of
their
peers
they
should
find
that
among
their
twelve
judges
there
was
not
one
who
could
read
or
write
the
english
language
with
accuracy
and
that
all
were
ready
to
convict
anybody
because
he
lived
in
a
front
the
citizen
and
the
jury
in
moral
overstrain
by
alger
merchants
who
in
return
for
a
larger
possible
restitution
habitually
compound
felonies
by
tacitly
agreeing
not
to
prosecute
those
who
have
defrauded
them
have
no
right
to
complain
because
juries
acquit
the
offenders
whom
they
finally
decide
it
to
be
worth
their
while
to
pursue
the
voter
who
has
not
the
courage
to
insist
that
hypocritical
laws
should
be
wiped
from
the
statute
books
should
express
no
surprise
when
juries
refuse
to
convict
those
who
violate
them
the
man
who
perjures
himself
to
escape
his
taxes
has
no
right
to
expect
that
his
fellow
citizens
are
going
to
place
a
higher
value
upon
an
oath
than
he
chapter
insanity
and
the
law
harry
kendall
thaw
shot
and
killed
stanford
white
on
the
day
of
june
although
most
of
the
coroner
jury
which
first
sat
upon
the
case
considered
him
irrational
he
was
committed
to
the
tombs
and
having
been
indicted
for
murder
remained
there
over
six
months
pending
his
trial
during
that
time
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
his
defence
was
to
be
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
but
as
under
the
new
york
law
it
is
not
necessary
specifically
to
enter
a
plea
of
insanity
to
the
indictment
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
that
defence
which
may
be
proven
under
the
general
plea
of
not
guilty
there
was
nothing
officially
on
record
to
indicate
this
purpose
neither
was
it
possible
for
the
district
attorney
to
secure
any
evidence
of
mental
condition
since
he
positively
refused
either
to
talk
to
the
prosecutor
medical
representatives
or
to
allow
himself
to
be
examined
by
them
jerome
therefore
was
compelled
to
enter
upon
an
elaborate
and
expensive
preparation
of
the
case
not
only
upon
its
merits
but
upon
the
possible
question
of
the
criminal
irresponsibility
of
the
defendant
the
case
was
moved
in
january
and
the
defence
thereupon
proceeded
to
introduce
a
limited
amount
of
testimony
tending
to
show
that
thaw
was
insane
when
he
did
the
shooting
while
much
of
this
evidence
commended
itself
but
little
to
either
the
prosecutor
or
the
jury
it
was
sufficient
to
raise
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
the
accused
was
a
fit
subject
for
trial
the
district
attorney
experts
united
in
the
opinion
that
while
he
knew
that
he
was
doing
wrong
when
he
shot
white
he
was
nevertheless
the
victim
of
a
hopeless
progressive
form
of
insanity
called
dementia
praecox
in
the
midst
of
the
trial
therefore
jerome
moved
for
a
commission
to
examine
into
the
question
of
how
far
thaw
was
capable
of
understanding
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him
and
consulting
with
counsel
and
frankly
expressed
his
personal
opinion
in
open
court
that
thaw
was
no
more
a
proper
subject
for
trial
than
a
baby
a
commission
was
appointed
which
reported
the
prisoner
was
sane
enough
to
be
tried
and
the
case
then
proceeded
at
great
length
with
the
surprising
result
that
in
spite
of
the
district
earlier
declaration
that
he
believed
thaw
to
be
insane
the
jury
disagreed
as
to
his
criminal
responsibility
a
substantial
number
voting
for
conviction
of
course
logically
they
would
have
been
obliged
either
to
acquit
entirely
on
the
ground
of
insanity
or
convict
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
but
several
voted
for
murder
in
the
second
degree
a
year
now
elapsed
during
which
equally
elaborate
preparations
were
made
for
a
second
trial
the
state
had
already
spent
some
and
yet
its
experts
had
never
had
the
slightest
opportunity
to
examine
or
interrogate
the
defendant
for
the
latter
had
not
taken
the
stand
at
the
first
trial
the
district
attorney
still
remained
on
record
as
having
declared
thaw
to
be
insane
and
his
own
experts
were
committed
to
the
same
proposition
yet
his
official
duty
compelled
him
to
prosecute
the
defendant
a
second
time
the
first
prosecution
had
occupied
months
and
delayed
the
trial
of
hundreds
of
other
prisoners
and
the
next
bid
fair
to
the
do
same
but
at
this
second
trial
the
defence
introduced
enough
testimony
within
two
days
to
satisfy
the
public
at
large
of
the
unbalanced
mental
condition
of
the
defendant
from
boyhood
after
a
comparatively
short
period
of
deliberation
the
jury
acquitted
the
prisoner
on
the
ground
of
insanity
which
may
have
meant
either
one
of
two
things
a
that
they
had
a
reasonable
doubt
in
their
own
minds
that
thew
knew
that
he
was
doing
wrong
when
he
committed
the
murder
something
hard
for
the
layman
to
believe
or
b
that
realizing
that
he
was
undoubtedly
the
victim
of
mental
disease
they
refused
to
follow
the
strict
legal
test
nearly
two
years
had
elapsed
since
the
homicide
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
had
been
spent
upon
the
case
every
corner
of
the
community
had
been
deluged
with
detailed
accounts
of
unspeakable
filth
and
depravity
the
moral
tone
of
society
had
been
depressed
and
the
only
element
which
had
profited
by
this
whole
lamentable
and
unnecessary
proceeding
had
been
the
sensational
press
yet
the
sole
reason
for
it
all
was
that
the
law
of
the
land
in
respect
to
insane
persons
accused
of
crime
was
hopelessly
out
of
date
the
question
of
how
far
persons
who
are
victims
of
diseased
mind
shall
be
held
criminally
responsible
for
their
acts
has
vexed
judges
jurors
doctors
and
lawyers
for
the
last
hundred
years
during
that
time
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
law
has
lagged
far
behind
science
in
the
march
of
progress
we
have
blundered
along
expecting
our
juries
to
reach
substantial
justice
by
dealing
with
each
individual
accused
as
most
appeals
to
their
enlightened
common
sense
and
the
fact
that
they
have
obeyed
their
common
sense
rather
than
the
law
is
the
only
reason
why
our
present
antiquated
and
unsatisfactory
test
of
who
shall
be
and
who
shall
not
be
held
responsible
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
remains
untouched
upon
the
because
its
inadequacy
is
so
apparent
and
because
no
experienced
person
seriously
expects
juries
to
apply
it
consistently
it
fairly
deserves
first
place
in
any
discussion
of
present
problems
thanks
to
human
sympathy
the
law
governing
insanity
has
had
comparatively
few
victims
but
the
fact
remains
that
more
than
one
irresponsible
insane
man
has
swung
miserably
from
the
scaffold
but
hard
cases
do
more
than
make
bad
law
they
make
lawlessness
a
statute
systematically
violated
is
worse
than
no
statute
at
all
and
exactly
in
so
far
as
we
secure
a
sort
of
justice
by
evading
the
law
as
it
stands
we
make
a
of
our
procedure
the
law
is
simply
that
any
person
is
to
be
held
criminally
responsible
for
a
deed
unless
he
was
at
the
time
laboring
under
such
a
defect
of
reason
as
not
to
know
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
act
and
that
it
was
wrong
this
doctrine
first
took
concrete
form
in
when
after
a
person
named
mcnaughten
who
had
shot
and
killed
a
certain
drummond
under
an
insane
delusion
that
the
latter
was
sir
robert
peel
had
been
acquitted
there
was
such
popular
uneasiness
over
the
question
of
what
constituted
criminal
responsibility
that
the
house
of
lords
submitted
four
questions
to
the
fifteen
judges
of
england
asking
for
an
opinion
on
the
law
governing
responsibility
for
offences
committed
by
persons
afflicted
with
certain
forms
of
insanity
it
is
unnecessary
to
set
forth
at
length
these
questions
but
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
judges
formulated
the
foregoing
rule
as
containing
the
issue
which
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
such
cases
the
questions
propounded
to
the
judges
and
their
answers
are
here
given
question
what
is
the
law
respecting
alleged
crimes
committed
by
persons
afflicted
with
insane
delusion
in
respect
of
one
or
more
particular
subjects
or
persons
as
for
instance
where
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime
the
accused
knew
he
was
acting
contrary
to
law
but
did
the
act
complained
of
with
a
view
under
the
influence
of
insane
delusion
of
redressing
or
revenging
some
supposed
grievance
or
injury
or
of
producing
some
supposed
public
benefit
answer
assuming
that
your
lordships
inquiries
are
confined
to
those
persons
who
labor
under
such
partial
delusions
only
and
are
not
in
other
respects
insane
we
are
of
opinion
that
notwithstanding
the
accused
did
the
act
complained
of
with
a
view
under
the
influence
of
insane
delusion
of
redressing
or
revenging
some
supposed
grievance
or
injury
or
of
producing
some
public
benefit
he
is
nevertheless
punishable
according
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
committed
if
he
knew
at
the
time
of
committing
such
crime
that
he
was
acting
contrary
to
law
by
which
expression
we
understand
your
lordships
to
mean
the
law
of
the
land
question
if
a
person
under
an
insane
delusion
as
to
existing
facts
commits
an
offence
in
consequence
thereof
is
he
thereby
excused
answer
the
answer
must
of
course
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
delusion
but
making
the
same
assumption
as
we
did
before
namely
that
he
labors
under
such
partial
delusion
only
and
is
not
in
other
respects
insane
we
think
he
must
be
considered
in
the
same
situation
as
to
responsibility
as
if
the
facts
with
respect
to
which
the
delusions
exist
were
real
for
example
if
under
the
influence
of
his
delusion
he
supposes
another
man
to
be
in
the
act
of
attempting
to
take
away
his
life
and
kills
the
man
as
he
supposes
in
he
would
be
exempt
from
punishment
if
his
delusion
was
that
the
deceased
had
inflicted
a
serious
injury
to
his
character
and
fortune
and
he
killed
him
in
revenge
for
such
supposed
injury
he
would
be
liable
to
punishment
question
what
are
the
proper
questions
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
when
a
person
afflicted
with
insane
delusions
respecting
one
or
more
particular
subjects
or
persons
is
charged
with
the
commission
of
a
crime
murder
for
instance
and
insanity
is
set
up
as
a
defence
question
in
what
terms
ought
the
question
to
be
left
to
the
jury
as
to
the
prisoner
state
of
mind
when
the
act
was
committed
answers
and
as
these
two
questions
appear
to
us
to
be
more
conveniently
answered
together
we
submit
our
opinion
to
be
that
the
jurors
ought
to
be
told
in
all
cases
that
every
man
is
presumed
to
be
sane
and
to
possess
a
sufficient
degree
of
reason
to
be
responsible
for
his
crimes
until
the
contrary
be
proved
to
their
satisfaction
and
that
to
establish
a
defence
on
the
ground
of
insanity
it
must
be
clearly
proved
that
at
the
time
of
committing
the
act
the
accused
was
laboring
under
such
a
defect
of
reason
from
disease
of
the
mind
as
not
to
know
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act
he
was
doing
or
if
he
did
know
it
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
doing
what
was
wrong
the
remainder
of
the
answer
goes
on
to
discuss
the
usual
way
the
question
is
put
to
the
jury
now
with
that
commendable
reverence
for
judicial
utterance
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
english
nation
and
is
so
conspicuously
absent
in
our
own
country
it
was
assumed
until
recently
that
this
solemn
pronunciamento
was
the
last
word
on
the
question
of
criminal
responsibility
and
settled
the
matter
once
and
forever
barristers
and
legislators
did
not
trouble
themselves
particularly
over
the
fact
that
in
the
study
of
mental
disease
was
in
its
infancy
and
judges
including
those
of
england
probably
knew
even
less
about
the
subject
than
they
do
now
in
it
was
supposed
that
insanity
save
of
the
sort
that
was
obviously
maniacal
necessitated
delusions
and
unless
a
man
had
these
delusions
no
one
regarded
him
as
insane
in
the
words
of
a
certain
judge
the
true
criterion
the
true
test
of
the
absence
or
presence
of
insanity
i
take
to
be
the
absence
or
presence
of
what
used
in
a
certain
sense
of
it
is
comprisable
in
a
single
term
namely
delusion
in
short
i
look
on
delusion
and
insanity
to
be
almost
if
not
altogether
convertible
terms
dew
clark
this
in
a
certain
broad
sense
probably
not
intended
by
the
judge
who
made
the
statement
is
nearly
true
but
unfortunately
is
not
entirely
so
the
dense
ignorance
surrounding
mental
disease
and
the
barbarous
treatment
of
the
insane
within
a
century
are
facts
familiar
to
everybody
lunatics
were
supposed
to
be
afflicted
with
demons
or
devils
which
took
possession
of
them
as
retribution
for
their
sins
and
in
addition
to
the
hopelessly
or
maniacally
insane
medical
science
recognized
only
a
partial
or
delusionary
insanity
today
it
would
be
regarded
about
as
comprehensive
to
relate
all
mental
diseases
to
the
delusion
as
to
regard
as
insane
only
those
who
frothed
at
the
mouth
but
the
particular
individual
out
of
whose
case
in
arose
the
rule
that
is
in
applied
to
all
defendants
indiscriminately
was
the
victim
of
a
clearly
defined
insane
delusion
and
the
four
questions
answered
by
the
judges
of
england
relate
only
to
persons
who
are
afflicted
with
insane
delusions
in
respect
to
one
or
more
particular
subjects
or
persons
nothing
is
said
about
insane
persons
without
delusions
or
about
persons
with
general
delusions
and
the
judges
limit
their
answers
even
further
by
making
them
apply
to
those
persons
who
labor
under
such
partial
delusion
only
and
are
not
in
other
respects
insane
a
medical
impossibility
modern
authorities
agree
that
a
man
can
not
have
insane
delusions
and
not
be
in
other
respects
insane
for
it
is
mental
derangement
which
is
the
cause
of
the
delusion
in
the
first
place
therefore
a
fundamental
conception
of
the
judges
in
answering
the
questions
was
probably
fallacious
and
in
the
second
although
the
test
they
offered
was
distinctly
limited
to
persons
afflicted
with
insane
delusions
it
has
ever
since
been
applied
to
all
insane
persons
irrespective
of
their
symptoms
finally
whether
the
judges
knew
anything
about
insanity
or
not
and
whether
in
their
answers
they
weighed
their
words
very
carefully
or
not
the
test
as
they
laid
it
down
is
by
no
means
clear
from
a
medical
or
even
legal
point
of
view
was
the
accused
laboring
under
such
a
defect
of
reason
as
not
to
know
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act
he
was
doing
or
not
to
know
that
it
was
wrong
what
did
these
judges
mean
by
know
what
does
the
reader
mean
by
know
what
does
the
ordinary
juryman
mean
by
it
we
are
left
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
word
should
be
given
as
justice
stephens
contended
it
should
be
a
very
broad
and
liberal
interpretation
such
as
able
to
judge
calmly
and
reasonably
of
the
moral
or
legal
character
of
a
proposed
action
or
a
limited
and
qualified
one
there
are
all
grades
and
degrees
of
knowledge
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
there
is
a
state
of
mind
which
i
have
heard
an
astute
expert
call
upon
the
witness
stand
an
insane
knowledge
and
equally
obvious
that
there
may
be
imperfect
nor
incomplete
knowledge
where
the
victim
sees
through
a
glass
darkly
certainly
it
seems
far
from
fair
to
interpret
the
test
of
responsibility
to
cover
a
condition
where
the
accused
may
have
had
a
hazy
or
realization
that
his
act
was
technically
contrary
to
the
law
and
even
more
dangerous
to
make
it
exclude
one
who
was
simply
unable
to
judge
calmly
and
reasonably
of
his
proposed
action
a
doctrine
which
could
almost
be
invoked
by
any
one
who
committed
homicide
in
a
state
of
anger
general
view
of
the
criminal
law
ordinarily
the
word
is
not
defined
at
all
and
the
befuddled
juryman
is
left
to
his
own
devices
in
determining
what
significance
he
shall
attach
not
only
to
this
word
but
to
the
test
as
a
whole
an
equally
ambiguous
term
is
the
word
wrong
the
judges
made
no
attempt
to
define
it
in
and
it
has
been
variously
interpreted
ever
since
now
it
may
mean
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
or
as
it
is
usually
construed
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
land
and
exactly
what
it
means
may
make
a
great
difference
to
the
accused
on
trial
if
the
defendant
thinks
that
god
has
directed
him
to
kill
a
wicked
man
he
may
know
that
such
an
act
will
not
only
be
contrary
to
law
but
also
in
opposition
to
the
moral
sense
of
the
community
as
a
whole
and
yet
he
may
believe
that
it
is
his
conscientious
duty
to
take
life
in
the
case
of
hadfield
who
deliberately
fired
at
george
iii
in
order
to
be
hung
the
defendant
believed
himself
to
be
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
that
only
by
so
doing
could
the
world
be
saved
applying
the
legal
test
and
translating
the
word
wrong
as
contrary
to
the
common
morality
of
the
community
wherein
he
resided
or
contrary
to
law
hadfield
ought
to
have
achieved
his
object
and
been
given
death
upon
the
scaffold
instead
of
being
clapped
as
he
was
into
a
lunatic
asylum
on
the
other
hand
if
the
word
wrong
is
judicially
interpreted
it
would
seem
to
be
given
an
elasticity
which
would
invite
inevitable
confusion
as
well
as
abuse
moreover
the
test
in
question
takes
no
cognizance
of
persons
who
have
no
power
of
control
the
law
of
new
york
and
most
of
the
states
does
not
recognize
irresistible
impulses
but
it
should
admit
the
medical
fact
that
there
are
persons
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
born
practically
without
any
inhibitory
capacity
whatever
and
that
there
are
others
whose
control
has
been
so
weakened
through
accident
or
disease
as
to
render
them
morally
irresponsible
the
psychopathic
inferiors
most
of
us
are
only
too
familiar
with
the
state
of
a
person
just
falling
under
the
influence
of
an
anesthetic
when
all
the
senses
seem
supernaturally
acute
the
reasoning
powers
are
active
and
unimpaired
and
the
patient
is
convinced
that
he
can
do
as
he
wills
whereas
in
reality
he
says
and
does
things
which
later
on
seem
impossible
in
their
absurdity
such
a
condition
is
equally
possible
to
the
victim
of
mental
disease
where
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
has
no
real
relevancy
the
test
of
irresponsibility
as
defined
by
law
is
hopelessly
inadequate
judged
by
present
medical
knowledge
there
is
no
longer
any
pretence
that
a
perception
of
the
nature
and
quality
of
an
act
or
that
it
is
wrong
or
right
is
conclusive
of
the
actual
insanity
of
a
particular
accused
in
a
recent
murder
case
a
distinguished
alienist
testifying
for
the
prosecution
admitted
that
over
seventy
per
cent
of
the
patients
under
his
treatment
all
of
whom
he
regarded
as
insane
and
irresponsible
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
could
distinguish
right
from
wrong
countless
attempts
have
been
made
to
reconcile
this
obvious
anachronism
with
justice
and
modern
knowledge
but
always
without
success
and
courts
have
wriggled
hard
in
their
efforts
to
make
the
test
adequate
to
the
particular
cases
which
they
have
been
trying
but
only
with
the
result
of
hopelessly
confounding
the
decisions
but
however
it
is
construed
the
test
as
laid
down
in
is
insufficient
in
medical
science
has
marched
on
with
giant
strides
while
the
law
so
far
as
this
subject
is
concerned
has
never
progressed
at
all
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
determine
mental
responsibility
by
any
such
artificial
rule
as
that
given
by
the
judges
to
the
lords
in
mcnaughten
case
and
which
juries
are
supposed
to
apply
in
the
courts
of
today
i
say
supposed
for
juries
do
not
apply
it
and
the
reason
is
simple
enough
you
can
not
expect
a
juryman
of
intelligence
to
follow
a
doctrine
of
law
which
he
instinctively
feels
to
be
crude
and
which
he
knows
is
arbitrarily
applied
no
juryman
believes
himself
capable
of
successfully
analyzing
a
prisoner
past
mental
condition
and
he
is
apt
to
suspect
that
however
sincere
the
experts
on
either
side
may
appear
their
opinions
may
be
even
less
definite
than
the
terms
in
which
they
are
expressed
the
spectacle
of
an
equal
number
of
gentlemen
all
using
good
english
and
all
wearing
clean
linen
reaching
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
on
precisely
the
same
facts
is
calculated
to
fill
the
juror
with
distrust
painful
as
it
is
to
record
the
fact
juries
are
sometimes
almost
as
sceptical
in
regard
to
doctors
as
they
always
are
in
regard
to
lawyers
the
usual
effect
of
the
expert
testimony
on
one
side
is
to
neutralize
that
on
the
other
for
there
is
no
practical
way
for
the
jury
to
distinguish
between
experts
since
the
foolish
ones
generally
look
as
learned
as
the
wise
ones
the
result
is
hopeless
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
juryman
an
inclination
to
throw
it
all
out
and
a
resort
to
other
testimony
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
of
course
he
has
no
individual
way
of
telling
whether
the
defendant
knew
right
from
wrong
whatever
that
may
mean
and
so
the
ultimate
test
that
he
applies
is
apt
to
be
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
really
queer
nutty
or
bughouse
or
some
other
equally
intelligible
equivalent
far
medically
insane
the
unfortunate
consequence
is
that
there
is
so
general
and
growing
a
scepticism
about
the
plea
of
insanity
entirely
apart
from
its
actual
merits
that
it
is
difficult
in
ordinary
cases
whatever
the
jurors
may
think
or
say
in
regard
to
the
matter
to
secure
twelve
men
who
will
give
the
defence
fair
consideration
at
the
outset
this
is
manifest
in
frequent
expressions
from
talesmen
such
as
i
think
the
defence
of
insanity
is
played
out
or
i
believe
everybody
is
a
little
insane
anyhow
very
popular
and
regarded
by
jurymen
as
witty
or
well
i
have
an
idea
that
when
a
fellow
ca
cook
up
any
other
defence
he
claims
to
be
insane
the
result
is
a
rather
paradoxical
situation
the
attitude
of
the
ordinary
jury
in
a
homicide
case
where
the
defence
of
insanity
is
interposed
is
usually
at
the
outset
one
of
distrust
and
their
impulse
is
to
brush
the
claim
aside
this
tendency
is
strengthened
by
the
legal
presumption
which
the
prosecutor
invariably
calls
to
their
attention
that
the
defendant
is
sane
every
expert
who
has
testified
for
the
defence
in
the
ordinary
knock
down
and
drag
out
homicide
case
must
have
felt
with
the
prisoner
attorneys
that
it
was
up
to
them
not
so
much
to
create
a
doubt
of
the
defendant
sanity
as
to
prove
that
he
was
insane
if
they
expected
consideration
from
the
jury
now
let
us
assume
that
the
defence
is
meritorious
and
that
the
prisoner
experts
have
created
a
favorable
impression
let
us
go
even
further
and
assume
that
they
have
generated
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
jury
as
to
the
defendant
responsibility
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offence
what
generally
occurs
not
as
one
would
suppose
an
acquittal
but
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
conviction
in
a
lower
degree
the
only
usual
result
of
an
honest
claim
of
irresponsibility
on
the
ground
of
insanity
is
to
lead
the
jury
to
reduce
the
grade
of
the
offence
from
murder
in
the
first
entailing
the
death
penalty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
the
jury
have
no
intention
of
taking
the
chance
involved
in
turning
the
man
loose
on
the
community
and
their
minds
are
filled
with
the
predominating
fact
that
a
human
being
has
been
killed
they
have
an
idea
that
it
is
as
easy
to
get
sworn
out
of
a
lunatic
asylum
as
they
suppose
it
is
to
get
sworn
into
one
and
they
know
that
if
the
prisoner
is
found
to
be
insane
when
sent
to
state
prison
he
will
be
transferred
elsewhere
they
therefore
as
a
rule
waste
little
time
upon
the
question
of
how
far
the
defendant
was
irresponsible
within
the
legal
definition
when
he
committed
the
deed
but
convict
him
on
general
principles
trusting
the
prison
officials
to
remedy
any
possible
injustice
the
jury
in
such
cases
ignore
the
law
and
decline
either
to
acquit
or
to
convict
in
accordance
with
the
test
their
action
becomes
rather
that
of
a
lay
commission
condemning
the
prisoner
to
hard
labor
for
life
on
the
ground
that
he
is
medically
insane
assuming
that
the
jury
take
the
defence
seriously
there
is
only
one
class
of
cases
where
in
the
writer
opinion
they
follow
the
legal
test
as
laid
down
by
the
court
that
is
to
say
in
cases
of
extreme
brutality
here
they
hold
the
prisoner
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
the
more
abhorrent
the
crime
even
where
its
nature
might
indicate
to
a
physician
that
the
accused
was
the
victim
of
some
sort
of
mania
the
less
likely
they
are
to
acquit
the
writer
has
prosecuted
perhaps
a
dozen
homicide
and
other
cases
where
the
defence
was
insanity
in
his
own
experience
he
has
known
of
no
acquittal
in
several
instances
the
defendants
were
undoubtedly
insane
but
strictly
speaking
probably
vaguely
knew
the
nature
and
quality
of
their
acts
and
that
they
were
wrong
in
a
few
of
these
the
juries
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
because
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
homicides
were
so
brutal
that
the
harshness
of
the
technical
doctrine
they
were
required
to
apply
was
overshadowed
in
their
minds
by
their
horror
of
the
act
itself
in
other
cases
where
either
the
accused
appeared
obviously
abnormal
as
he
sat
at
the
bar
of
justice
or
the
details
of
the
crime
were
less
abhorrent
they
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
in
accordance
with
the
reasoning
set
forth
in
the
foregoing
paragraph
the
writer
seriously
advances
the
suggestion
that
the
more
the
brutality
of
a
homicide
indicates
mental
derangement
the
less
chance
the
defendant
has
to
secure
an
acquittal
upon
the
plea
of
insanity
and
this
leads
us
to
that
increasingly
large
body
of
cases
where
the
usual
scepticism
of
the
jury
in
regard
to
such
defences
is
counterbalanced
by
some
real
or
imaginary
element
of
sympathy
in
cities
like
new
york
where
the
jury
system
is
seen
at
its
very
best
where
the
statistics
show
seventy
per
cent
of
convictions
by
verdict
for
the
year
and
where
the
sentiment
of
the
community
is
against
the
invocation
of
any
law
supposedly
higher
than
that
of
the
state
our
talesmen
are
unwilling
to
condone
homicide
or
to
act
as
pardoning
bodies
for
they
know
that
an
obviously
lawless
verdict
will
bring
down
upon
them
the
censure
of
the
public
and
the
press
this
is
perhaps
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
new
york
county
a
higher
percentage
of
women
are
convicted
of
homicide
than
of
men
but
the
plea
of
insanity
with
its
vague
test
of
responsibility
whose
terms
the
juryman
may
construe
for
himself
or
which
his
may
construe
for
him
offers
an
unlimited
and
fertile
field
for
the
reasonable
doubt
and
an
easy
excuse
for
the
conscientious
talesman
who
wants
to
acquit
if
he
can
juries
take
the
little
stock
in
irresistible
impulses
and
emotional
or
temporary
insanity
save
as
a
cloak
to
cover
an
unrighteous
acquittal
in
no
other
class
of
cases
does
luck
play
so
large
a
part
in
the
final
disposition
of
the
prisoner
a
jury
is
quite
as
likely
to
send
an
insane
man
to
the
electric
chair
as
to
acquit
a
defendant
who
is
fully
responsible
for
his
crime
to
recapitulate
from
the
writer
experience
the
ordinary
juror
tends
to
be
sceptical
as
to
the
good
faith
of
the
defence
of
insanity
when
once
this
distrust
is
removed
by
honest
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
defence
he
usually
declines
to
follow
the
legal
test
as
laid
down
by
the
court
on
the
general
theory
that
any
one
but
an
idiot
or
a
maniac
has
some
knowledge
of
what
he
is
doing
and
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
he
applies
the
strict
legal
test
only
in
cases
of
extreme
brutality
in
all
other
cases
he
follows
the
medical
rather
than
the
legal
test
but
instead
of
acquitting
the
accused
on
account
of
his
medical
irresponsibility
merely
convicts
in
a
lower
degree
the
following
deductions
may
also
fairly
be
made
from
observation
that
the
present
legal
test
for
criminal
responsibility
is
admittedly
vague
and
inadequate
affording
great
opportunity
for
divergent
expert
testimony
and
a
readily
availed
of
excuse
for
the
arbitrary
and
sentimental
actions
of
juries
to
which
is
largely
due
the
distrust
prevailing
of
the
claim
of
insanity
when
interposed
as
a
defence
to
crime
that
expert
medical
testimony
in
such
cases
is
largely
discounted
by
the
layman
that
in
no
class
of
cases
are
the
verdicts
of
jurors
so
apt
to
be
influenced
solely
by
emotion
and
prejudice
or
to
be
guided
less
by
the
law
as
laid
down
by
the
court
that
a
new
definition
of
criminal
responsibility
is
necessary
based
upon
present
knowledge
of
mental
disease
and
its
causes
lastly
that
as
whatever
definition
may
be
adopted
will
inevitably
be
difficult
of
application
by
an
untutored
lay
jury
our
procedure
should
be
so
amended
that
they
may
be
relieved
wherever
possible
of
a
task
sufficiently
difficult
for
even
the
most
experienced
and
expert
alienists
a
classification
of
the
different
forms
of
insanity
based
upon
its
causes
to
which
the
case
of
any
particular
accused
might
be
relegated
such
as
has
recently
been
urged
by
a
distinguished
young
neurologist
would
not
with
a
few
exceptions
assist
us
in
determining
his
responsibility
it
would
be
easy
to
say
then
as
now
that
lunatics
or
maniacs
should
not
be
held
responsible
for
their
acts
but
we
should
be
left
where
we
are
at
present
in
regard
to
all
those
shadowy
cases
where
the
accused
had
insane
incomplete
or
imperfect
knowledge
of
what
he
was
doing
it
would
be
ridiculous
for
example
to
lay
down
a
general
rule
that
no
person
suffering
from
hysterical
insanity
should
be
punished
for
his
acts
yet
even
so
such
a
classification
would
instantly
remedy
that
anachronism
in
our
present
law
which
refuses
to
recognize
as
irresponsible
those
born
without
power
to
control
their
emotions
the
psychopathic
inferiors
of
science
and
the
real
victims
of
dementia
praecox
of
course
if
the
insanity
under
which
the
defendant
labors
bears
no
relation
to
or
connection
with
the
deed
for
which
he
is
on
trial
there
would
logically
be
no
reason
why
his
insanity
on
other
subjects
should
be
any
defence
to
his
crime
for
example
there
is
the
case
of
the
harvard
professor
who
was
apparently
sane
on
all
other
matters
yet
believed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
glass
legs
had
this
man
in
wanton
anger
struck
and
killed
another
his
glass
leg
delusion
could
not
logically
have
availed
him
if
however
he
had
struck
and
killed
one
who
he
believed
was
going
to
shatter
his
legs
it
might
have
been
important
the
illustration
is
clear
enough
but
its
application
probably
involves
a
mistaken
premise
if
he
thought
he
had
glass
legs
his
mind
was
undoubtedly
deranged
whether
enough
or
not
enough
to
constitute
him
irresponsible
or
beyond
the
effect
of
penal
discipline
might
be
a
difficult
question
the
generally
accepted
doctrine
is
that
if
a
man
has
a
delusion
concerning
something
which
if
actually
existing
as
he
believed
it
to
be
would
be
no
excuse
for
his
committing
the
criminal
act
he
is
responsible
and
liable
to
punishment
but
as
bishop
well
says
this
branch
of
the
doctrine
should
be
cautiously
received
for
delusion
of
any
kind
is
strongly
indicative
of
a
generally
diseased
mind
the
new
test
to
determine
responsibility
will
recognize
as
does
the
law
of
germany
that
there
can
be
no
criminal
act
where
the
free
determination
of
the
will
is
excluded
by
disease
and
that
the
capacity
to
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
is
inconclusive
it
may
perhaps
have
to
take
a
general
form
leaving
it
to
a
lay
or
a
mixed
jury
to
say
merely
whether
the
accused
had
a
disease
of
the
mind
of
a
type
recognized
by
science
and
whether
the
alleged
criminal
act
was
of
such
a
character
as
would
naturally
flow
from
that
type
of
insanity
in
which
case
it
would
seem
obviously
just
to
regard
the
defendant
as
partially
irresponsible
and
perhaps
entirely
so
possibly
the
practical
needs
of
the
moment
might
be
met
by
permitting
such
a
jury
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
had
such
a
knowledge
of
the
wrongful
nature
and
consequences
of
his
act
and
such
a
control
over
his
will
as
to
be
a
proper
subject
of
punishment
this
would
require
the
jury
to
find
that
the
defendant
had
some
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
and
the
power
to
choose
between
them
in
any
event
to
render
the
accused
entirely
irresponsible
his
act
should
arise
out
of
and
be
caused
solely
by
the
diseased
condition
of
his
mind
the
law
while
asserting
the
responsibility
of
many
insane
people
should
recognize
partial
responsibility
as
well
state
richards
conn
the
reader
may
feel
that
little
after
all
would
be
gained
but
he
will
observe
that
at
any
rate
such
a
test
however
imperfect
would
permit
juries
to
do
lawfully
that
which
they
now
do
by
violating
their
oaths
the
writer
believes
that
the
best
concrete
test
yet
formulated
and
applied
by
any
court
is
that
laid
down
in
parsons
vs
the
state
of
alabama
was
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime
as
matter
of
fact
afflicted
with
a
disease
of
the
mind
so
as
to
be
either
idiotic
or
otherwise
insane
if
such
be
the
case
did
he
know
right
from
wrong
as
applied
to
the
particular
act
in
question
if
he
did
not
have
such
knowledge
he
is
not
legally
responsible
if
he
did
have
such
knowledge
he
may
nevertheless
not
be
legally
responsible
if
the
two
following
conditions
concur
if
by
reason
of
the
duress
of
such
mental
disease
he
had
so
far
lost
the
power
to
choose
between
the
right
and
wrong
and
to
avoid
doing
the
act
in
question
as
that
his
free
agency
was
at
the
time
destroyed
and
if
at
the
same
time
the
alleged
crime
was
so
connected
with
such
mental
disease
in
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
as
to
have
been
the
product
of
it
solely
but
whatever
modification
in
the
present
test
of
criminal
responsibility
is
adopted
there
must
come
an
equally
if
not
even
more
important
reform
in
the
procedure
in
insanity
cases
which
is
as
cumbersome
and
out
of
date
as
the
law
itself
as
things
stand
now
in
new
york
and
most
other
jurisdictions
there
are
no
adequate
means
open
to
the
state
to
find
out
the
actual
present
or
past
mental
condition
of
the
defendant
until
the
trial
itself
and
ofttimes
not
even
then
in
new
york
in
cases
like
thaw
the
accused
while
fully
intending
to
interpose
the
defence
of
insanity
which
he
is
now
permitted
to
do
simply
under
the
general
plea
of
not
guilty
may
not
only
conceal
the
fact
until
the
trial
but
may
likewise
successfully
block
every
effort
of
the
authorities
to
examine
him
and
find
out
his
present
mental
condition
he
may
thus
keep
it
out
of
the
power
of
the
district
attorney
to
secure
the
facts
upon
which
to
move
for
a
commission
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
be
in
an
insane
asylum
or
is
a
fit
subject
for
trial
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
the
prosecutor
from
obtaining
any
evidence
through
direct
medical
observation
by
which
to
meet
the
claim
which
may
be
sprung
suddenly
upon
him
later
at
the
trial
that
the
defendant
was
irresponsible
in
order
that
this
may
be
clearly
understood
by
the
reader
he
should
fully
appreciate
the
distinction
between
the
claim
on
the
part
of
an
accused
that
he
is
at
present
insane
and
for
that
reason
should
not
be
either
tried
or
punished
for
his
alleged
offence
and
the
defence
that
he
was
irrespective
of
his
present
mental
condition
insane
within
the
legal
definition
of
irresponsibility
at
the
time
he
committed
it
no
person
who
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
against
him
or
of
consulting
with
counsel
and
preparing
his
defence
can
be
placed
on
trial
at
all
or
if
already
on
trial
can
continue
to
be
tried
and
if
a
defendant
appears
to
the
court
to
be
insane
the
judge
may
appoint
a
commission
to
examine
him
and
report
as
to
his
present
condition
this
may
be
done
upon
the
application
either
of
the
state
of
the
accused
through
his
counsel
it
was
such
a
commission
to
determine
the
accused
present
mental
condition
that
district
attorney
jerome
upon
the
basis
of
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
defence
applied
for
and
secured
during
the
first
trial
of
harry
thaw
the
commission
reported
that
thaw
was
sane
enough
to
be
tried
and
the
court
then
proceeded
with
the
original
case
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
jury
to
say
whether
he
knew
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
act
and
that
it
was
wrong
when
he
shot
and
killed
white
this
was
a
totally
distinct
proceeding
from
the
interposition
of
the
defence
that
the
accused
was
irresponsible
when
he
committed
the
crime
charged
against
him
and
was
not
inconsistent
with
it
now
supposing
that
the
commission
had
reported
that
thaw
was
insane
at
the
time
of
examination
and
not
a
fit
subject
for
trial
but
on
the
contrary
ought
to
be
confined
in
an
insane
asylum
the
district
attorney
would
have
spent
some
twenty
odd
thousand
dollars
and
a
time
of
one
or
more
of
his
assistants
in
fruitless
preparation
yet
as
the
law
stands
on
the
books
in
new
york
there
is
no
adequate
way
for
the
prosecution
to
find
out
whether
this
enormous
expenditure
of
time
or
money
is
necessary
or
not
for
it
can
not
compel
the
defendant
to
submit
either
to
a
physical
or
mental
examination
to
do
so
has
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
equivalent
to
compelling
him
to
give
evidence
against
himself
thus
when
thaw
came
to
the
bar
at
his
first
trial
the
state
had
never
had
any
opportunity
through
an
examination
by
its
physicians
to
learn
what
his
present
condition
was
or
past
mental
condition
had
been
the
accused
on
the
other
hand
had
had
over
six
months
to
prepare
his
defence
and
had
fully
availed
himself
of
the
time
to
submit
to
the
most
exhaustive
examinations
on
the
part
of
his
own
experts
the
physicians
came
to
court
brimming
with
facts
to
which
they
could
testify
while
the
state
experts
had
only
the
barren
opportunity
for
determining
the
defendant
condition
afforded
by
observing
him
daily
in
the
court
room
and
hearing
what
thaw
own
doctors
claimed
that
they
had
discovered
there
was
no
chance
to
rebut
anything
which
the
latter
alleged
that
they
had
observed
and
their
testimony
save
in
so
far
as
it
was
inconsistent
or
contradictory
in
itself
remained
irrefutable
there
is
probably
no
procedure
which
would
be
held
constitutional
whereby
a
compulsory
examination
of
the
accused
could
be
had
upon
the
mere
application
of
the
prosecuting
authorities
but
as
a
commission
may
generally
be
appointed
at
any
time
after
an
accused
has
been
indicted
if
he
appears
to
the
court
to
be
insane
and
as
it
is
usually
within
the
power
of
the
district
attorney
where
such
is
the
case
to
bring
sufficient
evidence
of
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
before
the
prisoner
is
brought
to
trial
little
time
is
actually
lost
and
justice
is
rarely
defeated
except
in
those
cases
such
as
thaw
where
an
attempt
is
to
be
made
to
prove
the
accused
insane
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
crime
although
sane
at
the
time
of
trial
even
here
it
would
be
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
remedy
the
difficulty
and
the
proper
legal
steps
in
all
jurisdictions
should
be
taken
immediately
the
two
chief
objects
of
such
reforms
should
be
first
to
relieve
the
ordinary
jury
in
as
many
cases
as
possible
from
the
necessity
of
passing
upon
the
delicate
issue
of
a
defendant
mental
condition
at
a
previous
time
and
second
where
this
may
not
be
avoided
to
make
their
task
as
easy
as
possible
by
providing
a
a
more
scientific
and
definite
test
of
legal
responsibility
and
b
an
opportunity
for
adequate
examination
of
defendants
availing
themselves
of
this
defence
this
last
and
most
practical
reform
can
be
easily
secured
by
a
slight
alteration
in
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
already
provides
both
for
the
entering
of
the
specific
plea
of
insanity
and
for
the
introduction
of
the
defence
and
the
proof
of
insanity
under
the
general
plea
of
not
guilty
at
present
the
defendant
has
his
choice
of
openly
announcing
or
of
concealing
until
the
trial
his
intention
of
claiming
that
he
was
insane
and
so
irresponsible
for
his
crime
this
is
an
advantage
the
results
of
which
were
probably
not
fully
contemplated
by
the
legislature
and
one
to
which
an
accused
has
no
fair
claim
fortunately
in
the
same
section
of
the
code
which
provides
that
the
court
may
appoint
a
commission
to
inquire
into
the
sanity
of
a
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
trial
there
exists
another
provision
hitherto
little
noticed
that
when
a
defendant
pleads
insanity
as
prescribed
in
section
the
court
in
which
the
indictment
is
pending
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
trial
of
the
indictment
may
appoint
a
commission
of
not
more
than
three
disinterested
persons
to
examine
him
and
report
to
the
court
as
to
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
if
a
defendant
intends
to
prove
himself
irresponsible
for
his
offence
why
should
he
not
be
compelled
to
enter
a
specific
plea
to
that
effect
once
he
has
entered
that
plea
the
law
as
it
stands
just
quoted
will
do
the
rest
no
reason
has
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
writer
why
the
admission
of
any
evidence
upon
the
defendant
trial
tending
to
show
that
he
was
mentally
irresponsible
at
the
time
of
committing
the
crime
should
not
be
made
contingent
upon
the
defence
of
insanity
having
been
specifically
pleaded
either
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment
or
later
by
substitution
for
or
in
conjunction
with
the
plea
of
not
guilty
this
would
deprive
him
of
no
constitutional
right
whatever
there
is
no
legal
necessity
of
permitting
an
accused
to
prove
insanity
under
a
general
answer
of
not
guilty
then
upon
his
own
plea
that
he
had
been
insane
he
could
instantly
be
committed
to
some
place
of
observation
where
a
permanent
medical
board
of
inquiry
could
be
given
full
opportunity
to
examine
him
and
study
his
case
with
a
view
to
determining
his
present
and
past
mental
condition
he
would
still
have
in
prospect
his
regular
jury
trial
but
if
this
board
found
him
at
the
present
time
insane
the
court
could
immediately
commit
him
to
an
asylum
pending
recovery
precisely
as
under
the
present
procedure
while
if
they
found
him
sane
at
the
present
time
but
reported
that
in
their
opinion
whatever
test
medical
or
legal
they
might
have
applied
he
was
irresponsible
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime
it
is
unlikely
that
any
prosecutor
would
bring
him
to
trial
if
however
they
reported
that
he
was
not
only
sane
but
had
been
sane
at
the
time
of
his
crime
it
is
probable
that
any
proposed
defence
of
insanity
would
be
abandoned
while
if
it
was
still
urged
by
the
accused
the
opinion
of
such
a
board
would
carry
far
greater
weight
at
the
ultimate
trial
of
the
case
than
the
individual
opinions
of
experts
retained
and
paid
by
either
side
for
that
particular
occasion
only
and
having
had
only
a
comparatively
limited
opportunity
for
examination
at
any
rate
if
the
court
called
in
the
services
of
such
a
board
of
medical
judges
to
assist
as
amici
curie
in
determining
the
defendant
condition
while
their
opinion
would
not
be
conclusive
upon
the
jury
it
would
at
least
do
away
with
the
present
lamentable
necessity
of
learned
men
answering
yes
or
no
to
a
hypothetical
question
fifty
thousand
words
long
when
the
most
superficial
personal
examination
of
the
accused
would
settle
the
matter
definitely
in
their
minds
such
a
procedure
is
in
general
use
in
germany
and
other
continental
countries
and
is
likewise
substantially
followed
in
massachusetts
maine
vermont
and
new
hampshire
another
equally
efficacious
means
of
dealing
with
the
matter
would
be
to
substitute
upon
a
defendant
plea
of
insanity
a
full
jury
of
experts
like
any
special
jury
for
the
ordinary
petit
jury
there
is
good
reason
to
hope
that
we
may
soon
see
in
all
the
states
adequate
provision
for
preliminary
examination
upon
the
plea
of
insanity
and
a
new
test
of
criminal
responsibility
consistent
with
humanity
and
modern
medical
knowledge
even
then
although
murderers
who
indulge
in
popular
crime
will
probably
be
acquitted
on
the
ground
of
insanity
we
shall
at
least
be
spared
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
juries
arbitrarily
committing
persons
charged
with
homicide
to
imprisonment
at
hard
labor
for
life
and
in
a
large
measure
do
away
with
the
present
unedifying
exhibition
of
two
groups
of
hostile
experts
each
interpreting
an
archaic
and
inadequate
test
of
criminal
responsibility
in
his

in

there
are
a
million
and
a
half
of
italians
in
the
united
states
of
whom
nearly
six
hundred
thousand
reside
in
new
york
city
more
than
in

itself
naples
alone
of

and
there
are
extensive

often
numbering
as
many

thousand
in
several
other
cities
so
vast
a
population
is
bound
to
contain
elements
of
both
strength
and
weakness
the
north
italians
are
molto
simpatici
to
the
american
character
and
many
of
their
national
traits
are
singularly
like
our
own
for
they
are
honest
thrifty
industrious
and
the
italians
from
the
extreme
south
of
the
peninsula
have
fewer
of
these
qualities
and
are
apt
to
be
ignorant
lazy
destitute
and
superstitious
a
considerable
percentage
especially
of
those
from
the
cities
are
criminal
even
for
a
long
time
after
landing
in
america
the
calabrians
and
sicilians
often
exhibit
a
lack
of
enlightenment
more
characteristic
of
the
middle
ages
than
of
the
twentieth
century
at
home
they
have
lived
in
a
stone
hut
about
fifteen
feet
square
half
open
to
the
sky
its
only
saving
quality
in
one
corner
the
entire
family
sleeping
in
a
promiscuous
pile
on
a
bed
of
leaves
in
another
a
domestic
zoo
consisting
of
half
a
dozen
hens
a
cock
a
goat
and
a
donkey
they
neither
read

nor
exchange
ideas
the
sight
of
a
uniform
means
to
them
either
a
a
compulsory
enlistment
in
the
army
or
an
arrest
and
at
its
appearance
the
man
will
run
and
the
wife
and
children
turn
into
stone
they
are
stubborn
and
distrustful
they
are
the
same
as
they
were
a
thousand
or
more
years
gone
by
when
the
writer
was
acting
as
an
assistant
prosecutor
in
new
york
county
a
young
italian
barely
twenty
years
of
age
was
brought
to
the
bar
charged
with
assault
with
intent
to
kill
the
complainant
was
a
withered
sicilian
woman
who
claimed
to
be
his
wife
both
spoke
an
almost
unintelligible
dialect
the
case
on
its
face
was
simple
enough
an
officer
testified
that
on
a
sunday
morning
in
mulberry
bend
park
at
a
distance
of
about
fifty
feet
from
where
he
was
standing
he
saw
the
defendant
who
had
been
walking
peaceably
with
the
complaining
witness
suddenly
draw
a
long
and
deadly
looking
knife
and
proceed
to
slash
her
about
the
head
and
arms
it
had
taken
the
officer
but
a
moment
or
two
to
seize
the
defendant
from
behind
and
disarm
him
but
in
the
meantime
he
had
inflicted
some
eleven
wounds
upon
her
body
no
explanation
had
been
offered
for
this
terrible
assault
and
the
complainant
had
appeared
involuntarily
before
the
grand
jury
and
afterward
had
to
be
kept
in
the
house
of
detention
as
a
hostile
witness
the
woman
who
appeared
to
be
about
fifty
years
old
was
sworn
and
on
being
questioned
stated
that
she
had
been
married
to
the
defendant
in
sicily
three
years
before
she
declined
to
admit
that
he
had
attacked
or
harmed
her
in
any
way
constantly
mumbling
he
is
my
husband
do
not
punish
him
the
defendant
however
seemed
eager
to
get
on
the
stand
and
to
tell
his
story
nor
did
the
introduction
of
the
knife
in
evidence
or
the
exhibition
of
the
woman
wounds
embarrass
him
in
the
slightest
degree
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
who
had
only
to
explain
to
be
entirely
exonerated
from
blame
he
nodded
at
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
scowled
at
the
complainant
who
was
speedily
conducted
to
a
place
where
no
harm
could
possibly
come
to
her
when
at
last
he
was
sworn
he
could
hardly
restrain
himself
into
coherency
yes
that
woman
forced
me
to
marry
her
he
testified
in
substance
but
in
the
eyes
of
god
i
am
not
her
husband
for
she
bewitched
me
else
would
i
have
married
an
old
crone
who
could
not
have
borne
me
children
when
her
spells
weakened
i
left
her
and
came
to
america
here
i
met
the
woman
i
love
rosina
and
as
i
had
been
bewitched
into
the
other
marriage
we
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
for
two
years
then
one
day
a
friend
told
me
that
the
old
woman
had
followed
me
over
the
sea
and
was
going
to
throw
her
spells
upon
me
again
but
i
did
not
inform
rosina
of
these
things
the
next
evening
she
told
me
that
an
old
woman
had
been
to
the
house
and
asked
for
me
for
days
my
first
wife
lurked
in
the
neighborhood
beseeching
me
to
come
back
to
her
but
i
told
her
that
in
the
eyes
of
god
she
was
not
my
wife
then
in
revenge
she
cast
the
evil
eye
upon
the
child
sul
bambino
and
for
six
weeks
it
ailed
and
then
died
again
the
witch
asked
me
to
go
with
her
and
again
i
refused
this
time
she
cast
her
evil
eye
upon
my
wife
and
rosina
grew
pale
and
sick
and
took
to
her
bed
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
you
understand
i
resolved
to
slay
her
just
as
you
giudici
would
have
done
i
bought
a
and
sharpened
it
and
asked
her
to
walk
with
me
to
the
park
and
i
would
have
killed
her
had
not
the
police
prevented
me
wherefore
o
giudici
i
pray
you
to
recall
her
and
permit
me
to
kill
her
or
to
decree
that
she
be
hung
this
case
illustrates
the
depths
of
ignorance
and
superstition
that
are
occasionally
to
be
found
among
italian
peasant
immigrants
another
actual
experience
may
demonstrate
the
mediaeval
treachery
of
which
the
sicilian
mafiuso
is
capable
and
how
little
his
manners
or
ideals
have
progressed
in
the
last
five
hundred
years
or
so
a
photographer
and
his
wife
both
from
palermo
came
to
new
york
and
rented
a
comfortable
home
with
which
was
connected
a
studio
in
the
course
of
time
a
young
man
a
mafiuso
from
palermo
was
engaged
as
an
assistant
and
promptly
fell
in
love
with
the
photographer
wife
she
was
tired
of
her
husband
and
together
they
plotted
the
latter
murder
after
various
plans
had
been
considered
and
rejected
they
determined
on
poison
and
the
assistant
procured
enough
cyanide
of
mercury
to
kill
a
hundred
photographers
and
turned
it
over
to
his
mistress
to
administer
to
the
victim
in
his
marsala
but
at
the
last
moment
her
hand
lost
its
courage
and
she
weakly
sewed
the
poison
up
for
future
use
inside
the
ticking
of
the
feather
bolster
on
the
marital
bed
this
was
not
at
all
to
the
liking
of
her
lover
who
thereupon
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
by
hiring
another
mafiuso
to
remove
the
photographer
with
a
through
the
heart
in
order
that
the
assassin
might
have
a
favorable
opportunity
to
effect
his
object
the
assistant
who
posed
as
a
devoted
friend
of
his
employer
invited
the
couple
to
a
christmas
festival
at
his
own
apartment
here
they
all
spent
an
animated
and
friendly
evening
together
drinking
toasts
and
singing
christmas
carols
and
toward
midnight
the
party
broke
up
with
mutual
protestations
of
regard
if
the
writer
remembers
accurately
the
evidence
was
that
the
two
men
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
after
a
series
of
farewells
the
photographer
started
home
it
was
a
clear
moonlight
night
with
the
streets
covered
with
a
glistening
fall
of
snow
the
wife
singing
a
song
walked
arm
in
arm
with
her
husband
until
they
came
to
a
corner
where
a
jutting
wall
cast
a
deep
shadow
across
the
sidewalk
at
this
point
she
stepped
a
little
ahead
of
him
and
at
the
same
moment
the
hired
assassin
slipped
up
behind
the
victim
and
drove
his
knife
into
his
back
the
wife
shrieked
the
husband
staggered
and
fell
and
the
bravo
fled
the
police
arrived
and
so
did
an
ambulance
which
removed
the
hysterical
wife
and
the
transfixed
victim
to
a
hospital
luckily
the
ambulance
surgeon
did
not
remove
the
knife
and
his
failure
to
do
so
saved
the
life
of
the
photographer
who
in
consequence
practically
lost
no
blood
and
whose
cortex
was
skilfully
hooked
up
by
a
dextrous
surgeon
in
a
month
he
was
out
in
another
the
police
had
caught
the
murderer
and
he
was
soon
convicted
and
sentenced
to
state
prison
under
a
contract
with
the
assistant
to
be
paid
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
each
year
he
had
to
serve
evidently
the
lover
and
his
mistress
concluded
that
the
photographer
bore
a
charmed
life
for
they
made
no
further
homicidal
attempts
so
much
for
the
story
as
an
illustration
of
the
mediaeval
character
of
some
of
our
sicilian
immigrants
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
taste
for
the
romantic
and
picturesque
it
should
be
added
however
that
the
matter
did
not
end
here
the
convict
having
served
several
years
found
that
the
photographer
assistant
was
not
keeping
his
part
of
the
contract
as
a
result
of
which
the
assassin
wife
and
children
were
suffering
for
lack
of
food
and
clothing
he
made
repeated
but
fruitless
attempts
to
compel
the
party
of
the
first
part
to
pay
up
and
finally
in
despair
wrote
to
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
that
he
could
if
he
would
a
tale
unfold
that
would
harrow
up
almost
soul
jerome
therefore
on
the
gamble
of
getting
something
worth
while
sent
detective
russo
to
auburn
to
interview
the
prisoner
that
is
how
the
whole
story
came
to
be
known
the
case
was
put
in
the
hands
and
an
indictment
for
the
very
unusual
crime
of
attempted
murder
there
are
only
one
or
two
such
cases
on
record
in
new
york
state
was
speedily
found
against
the
photographer
assistant
at
the
trial
the
lover
saw
his
mistress
compelled
to
turn
state
evidence
against
him
to
save
herself
she
testified
to
the
christmas
carols
and
the
cyanide
of
mercury
did
you
ever
remove
this
terrible
poison
from
the
bolster
demanded
the
defendant
counsel
in
a
sneering
tone
no
answered
the
woman
have
you
ever
changed
the
bolster
he
persisted
no
then
it
there
yet
think
so
falteringly
i
demand
that
this
incredible
yarn
be
investigated
cried
the
lawyer
i
ask
that
the
court
send
for
the
bolster
and
cut
it
open
here
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
the
writer
had
no
choice
but
to
accede
to
this
request
and
the
bolster
was
hunted
down
and
brought
into
court
with
some
anxiety
both
sides
watched
while
the
lining
was
slit
with
a
penknife
a
few
feathers
fluttered
to
the
floor
as
the
fingers
of
the
witness
felt
inside
and
came
in
contact
with
the
poison
the
assistant
was
convicted
of
attempted
murder
on
the
convict
testimony
and
sentenced
to
sing
sing
for
years
that
was
the
end
of
the
second
lesson
about
a
month
afterward
the
defendant
counsel
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
convict
now
admitted
his
testimony
to
have
been
wholly
false
and
produced
an
affidavit
from
the
assassin
to
that
effect
naturally
so
startling
an
allegation
demanded
investigation
yes
insisted
the
bravo
it
was
all
made
up
a
camorra
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
and
he
had
invented
the
whole
thing
in
order
to
get
a
vacation
from
state
prison
and
a
free
ride
to
new
york
however
the
court
denied
the
motion
the
writer
procured
a
new
indictment
against
the
assassin
this
time
for
perjury
and
he
was
sentenced
to
another
additional
term
in
prison
what
induced
this
sudden
and
extraordinary
change
of
mind
on
his
part
can
only
be
surmised
these
two
cases
are
extreme
examples
of
the
mediaevalism
that
to
a
considerable
degree
prevails
in
new
york
city
probably
in
chicago
and
boston
and
wherever
there
is
an
excessive
south
italian
population
the
conditions
under
which
a
large
number
of
italians
live
in
this
country
are
favorable
not
only
to
the
continuance
of
ignorance
but
to
the
development
of
disease
and
crime
naples
is
bad
enough
no
doubt
the
people
there
are
and
homeless
but
in
new
york
city
they
are
worse
than
homeless
it
is
better
far
to
sleep
under
the
stars
than
in
a
stuffy
room
with
ten
or
twelve
other
persons
let
the
reader
climb
the
stairs
of
some
of
the
tenements
in
elizabeth
street
or
go
through
those
in
union
street
brooklyn
and
he
will
get
firsthand
evidence
this
is
generally
true
of
the
lower
class
of
italians
throughout
the
united
states
whether
in
the
city
or
country
they
live
under
worse
conditions
than
at
home
you
may
go
through
the
railroad
camps
and
see
twenty
men
sleeping
together
in
a
built
of
lath
and
clay
the
writer
knows
of
one
italian
laborer
in
massachusetts
who
slept
in
a
floorless
mud
hovel
about
six
feet
square
with
one
hole
to
go
in
and
out
by
and
another
in
the
roof
for
ventilation
in
order
to
save
per
month
all
honor
to
him
garibaldi
was
of
just
such
stuff
only
he
suffered
in
a
better
cause
in
naples
the
young
folks
are
out
all
day
in
the
sun
here
they
are
indoors
all
the
year
round
for
the
consequences
of
this
change
see
peccorini
article
in
the
for
january
on
the
tuberculosis
that
soon
develops
among
italians
who
abroad
were
accustomed
to
live
in
the
country
but
here
are
forced
to
exist
in
tenements
now
for
historic
reasons
these
south
italians
hate
and
distrust
all
governmental
control
and
despise
any
appeal
to
the
ordinary
tribunals
of
justice
to
assert
a
right
or
to
remedy
a
wrong
it
has
been
justly
said
by
a
celebrated
italian
writer
that
in
effect
there
is
some
instinct
for
civil
war
in
the
heart
of
every
italian
the
insufferable
tyranny
of
the
bourbon
dynasty
made
every
outlaw
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
oppressed
people
of
the
kingdom
of
the
two
sicilies
even
if
he
robbed
them
they
felt
that
he
was
the
lesser
of
two
evils
and
sheltered
him
from
the
authorities
out
of
this
feeling
grew
the
omerta
which
paralyzes
the
arm
of
justice
both
in
naples
and
sicily
the
late
marion
crawford
thus
summed
up
the
sicilian
code
of
honor
according
to
this
code
a
man
who
appeals
to
the
law
against
his
fellow
man
is
not
only
a
fool
but
a
coward
and
he
who
can
not
take
care
of
himself
without
the
protection
of
the
police
is
both
it
is
reckoned
as
cowardly
to
betray
an
offender
to
justice
even
though
the
offence
be
against
one
self
as
it
would
be
not
to
avenge
an
injury
by
violence
it
is
regarded
as
dastardly
and
contemptible
in
a
wounded
man
to
betray
the
name
of
his
assailant
because
if
he
recovers
he
must
naturally
expect
to
take
vengeance
himself
a
rhymed
sicilian
proverb
sums
up
this
principle
the
supposed
speaker
being
one
who
has
been
stabbed
if
i
live
i
will
kill
thee
it
says
if
i
die
i
forgive
thee
any
one
who
has
had
anything
to
do
with
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
a
city
with
a
large
italian
population
must
have
found
himself
constantly
hampered
by
precisely
this
same
omerta
the
south
italian
feels
obliged
to
conceal
the
name
of
the
assassin
and
very
likely
his
person
though
he
himself
be
but
an
accidental
witness
of
the
crime
and
while
the
writer
knows
of
no
instance
in
new
york
city
where
an
innocent
man
has
gone
to
prison
himself
rather
than
betray
a
criminal
signor
cutera
formerly
chief
of
police
in
palermo
states
that
there
have
been
many
cases
in
sicily
where
men
have
suffered
long
terms
of
penal
servitude
and
even
have
died
in
prison
rather
than
give
information
to
the
police
in
point
of
fact
however
the
omerta
is
not
confined
to
italians
it
is
a
common
attribute
of
all
who
are
opposed
to
authority
of
any
kind
including
small
boys
and
criminals
and
with
the
latter
arises
no
more
from
a
half
chivalrous
loyalty
to
their
fellows
than
it
does
from
hatred
of
the
police
and
a
uniform
desire
to
block
their
efforts
even
if
a
personal
adversary
should
go
unpunished
in
consequence
fear
that
complaint
made
or
assistance
given
to
the
authorities
will
result
in
vengeance
being
taken
upon
the
complainant
by
some
comrade
or
relative
of
the
accused
distrust
of
the
ability
of
the
police
to
do
anything
anyway
disgust
at
the
delay
involved
and
lastly
if
not
chiefly
the
realization
that
as
a
witness
in
a
court
of
justice
the
informer
as
a
professional
criminal
would
have
little
or
no
standing
or
credence
and
in
addition
would
under
be
compelled
to
lay
bare
the
secrets
of
his
unsavory
past
perhaps
resulting
indirectly
in
a
term
in
prison
for
himself
thus
may
be
accounted
for
much
of
the
supposed
romantic
if
misguided
chivalry
of
the
south
italian
it
is
common
both
to
him
and
to
the
bowery
tough
the
writer
knew
personally
a
professional
crook
who
was
twice
almost
shot
to
pieces
in
chatham
square
new
york
city
and
who
persistently
declined
even
on
his
dying
bed
to
give
a
hint
of
the
identity
of
his
assassins
announcing
that
if
he
got
well
he
would
attend
to
that
little
matter
himself
much
of
the
romance
surrounding
crime
and
criminals
on
examination
fades
into
the
light
of
common
day
the
obvious
product
not
of
idealism
but
of
much
more
likely
in
italy
than
in
the
united
states
as
illustrating
the
backwardness
of
our
italian
in
coming
forward
when
the
criminality
of
one
of
their
countrymen
is
at
stake
the
last
three
cases
of
kidnapping
in
new
york
city
may
be
mentioned
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
the
little
boy
of
scimeca
of
prince
street
new
york
was
taken
from
his
home
from
outside
sources
the
police
heard
that
the
child
had
been
stolen
but
although
he
was
receiving
constant
letters
and
telephonic
communications
from
the
kidnappers
scimeca
would
not
give
them
any
information
it
is
known
on
pretty
good
authority
that
the
sum
of
was
at
first
demanded
as
a
ransom
and
was
lowered
by
degrees
to
and
finally
to
scimeca
at
last
made
terms
with
the
kidnappers
and
was
told
to
go
one
evening
to
city
park
where
he
is
said
to
have
handed
to
a
stranger
the
child
was
found
wandering
aimlessly
in
the
streets
next
day
after
a
detention
of
nearly
three
months
the
second
case
was
that
of
vincenzo
sabello
a
grocer
of
broome
street
who
lost
his
little
boy
on
august
after
thirty
days
he
reported
the
matter
to
the
police
but
shortly
after
tried
to
throw
them
off
the
track
by
saying
that
he
had
been
mistaken
that
the
boy
had
not
been
kidnapped
and
that
he
wished
no
assistance
finally
he
ordered
the
detectives
out
of
his
place
about
a
month
later
the
child
was
recovered
but
not
according
to
reliable
information
until
sabello
had
handed
over
pending
the
recovery
of
the
sabello
boy
a
third
child
was
stolen
from
the
top
floor
of
a
house
at
elizabeth
street
the
father
leonardo
quartiano
reported
the
disappearance
and
in
answer
to
questions
stated
that
he
had
received
no
letters
or
telephone
messages
why
should
i
he
inquired
with
uplifted
hands
and
the
most
guileless
demeanor
i
am
poor
i
am
a
humble
fishmonger
in
point
of
fact
quartiano
at
the
time
had
a
pocketful
of
blackmail
letters
and
after
four
weeks
paid
a
good
ransom
and
got
back
his
boy
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
correctly
the
number
of
italian
criminals
in
america
or
their
influence
upon
our
police
statistics
but
in
several
classes
of
crime
the
italians
furnish
from
fifteen
to
fifty
per
cent
of
those
convicted
in
murder
assault
with
intent
to
kill
blackmail
and
extortion
they
head
the
list
as
well
as
in
certain
other
offences
unnecessary
to
describe
more
fully
but
prevalent
in
naples
and
the
south
joseph
petrosino
the
able
and
fearless
officer
of
new
york
police
who
was
murdered
in
palermo
while
in
the
service
of
the
country
of
his
adoption
was
while
he
lived
our
greatest
guaranty
of
protection
against
the
italian
criminal
but
petrosino
is
gone
the
fear
of
him
no
longer
will
deter
italian
from
seeking
asylum
in
the
united
states
he
once
told
the
writer
that
there
were
five
thousand
italian
in
new
york
city
alone
of
whom
he
knew
a
large
proportion
by
sight
and
name
signor
ferrero
the
noted
historian
is
reported
to
have
stated
on
his
recent
visit
to
america
that
there
were
thirty
thousand
italian
criminals
in
new
york
city
whatever
their
actual
number
there
are
quite
enough
at
all
events
is
a
national
hero
in
italy
where
he
was
known
as
il
sherlock
holmes
the
italian
sherlock
holmes
many
novels
in
which
he
figures
as
the
central
character
have
a
wide
circulation
there
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
these
criminals
whether
or
novices
are
the
products
or
byproducts
of
the
influence
of
the
two
great
secret
societies
of
southern
italy
these
societies
and
the
unorganized
criminal
propensity
and
atmosphere
which
they
generate
are
known
as
the
mala
vita
the
mafia
a
purely
sicilian
product
exerts
a
much
more
obvious
influence
in
america
than
the
camorra
since
the
mafia
is
powerful
all
over
sicily
while
the
camorra
is
practically
confined
to
the
city
of
naples
and
its
environs
the
sicilians
in
america
vastly
outnumber
the
neapolitans
thus
in
new
york
city
for
every
one
camorrist
you
will
find
seven
or
eight
mafiusi
but
they
are
all
essentially
of
a
piece
and
the
artificial
distinction
between
them
in
italy
disappears
entirely
in
america
historically
the
mafia
burst
from
a
soil
fertilized
by
the
blood
of
martyred
patriots
and
represented
the
revolt
of
the
people
against
all
forms
of
the
tyrannous
government
of
the
bourbons
but
the
fact
remains
that
whatever
its
origin
the
mafia
is
a
criminal
organization
having
like
the
camorra
for
its
ultimate
object
blackmail
and
extortion
its
lower
ranks
are
recruited
from
the
scum
of
palermo
who
combining
extraordinary
physical
courage
with
the
lowest
type
of
viciousness
generally
live
by
the
same
means
that
supports
the
east
side
cadet
in
new
york
city
and
who
end
either
in
prison
or
on
the
or
gradually
develop
into
real
mafiusi
and
perhaps
gain
some
influence
it
is
in
addition
an
criminal
political
machine
which
under
cover
of
a
pseudoprinciple
deals
in
petty
crime
wholesale
blackmail
political
jobbery
and
the
sale
of
elections
and
may
fairly
be
compared
to
the
lowest
types
of
clubs
or
societies
in
new
york
city
in
palmero
it
is
made
up
of
gangs
of
toughs
and
criminals
not
unlike
the
camorrist
gangs
of
naples
but
without
their
organization
and
is
kept
together
by
personal
allegiance
to
some
leader
such
a
leader
is
almost
always
under
the
patronage
of
a
boss
in
new
york
or
a
in
italy
who
uses
his
influence
to
protect
the
members
of
the
gang
when
in
legal
difficulties
and
find
them
jobs
when
out
of
work
and
in
need
of
funds
thus
the
boss
can
rely
on
the
gang
assistance
in
elections
in
return
for
favors
at
other
times
such
gangs
may
act
in
harmony
or
be
in
open
hostility
or
conflict
with
one
another
but
all
are
united
as
against
the
police
and
exhibit
much
the
same
sort
of
omerta
in
chatham
square
as
in
palermo
the
difference
between
the
mafia
and
camorra
and
the
gangs
of
new
york
city
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
latter
are
so
much
less
numerous
and
powerful
and
bribery
and
corruption
so
much
less
prevalent
that
they
can
exert
no
practical
influence
in
politics
outside
the
board
of
aldermen
whereas
the
italian
societies
of
the
mala
vita
exert
an
influence
everywhere
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
cabinet
and
even
closer
to
the
king
in
fact
political
corruption
has
been
and
still
is
of
a
character
in
italy
luckily
unknown
in
america
not
in
the
amounts
of
money
paid
over
which
are
large
enough
but
in
the
calm
and
attitude
adopted
toward
the
subject
in
parliament
and
elsewhere
the
overwhelming
majority
of
italian
criminals
in
this
country
come
from
sicily
calabria
naples
and
its
environs
they
have
lived
most
of
their
lives
upon
the
ignorance
fear
and
superstitions
of
their
they
know
that
so
long
as
they
confine
their
criminal
operations
to
italians
of
the
lower
class
they
need
have
little
terror
of
the
law
since
if
need
be
their
victims
will
harbor
them
from
the
police
and
perjure
themselves
in
their
defence
for
the
ignorant
italian
brings
to
this
country
with
him
the
same
attitude
toward
government
and
the
same
distrust
of
the
law
that
characterized
him
and
his
at
home
the
same
omerta
that
makes
it
so
difficult
to
convict
any
italian
of
a
serious
offence
the
italian
crook
is
and
soon
grasps
the
legal
situation
he
finds
his
fellow
countrymen
prospering
for
they
are
generally
a
and
thrifty
lot
and
he
proceeds
to
levy
tribute
on
them
just
as
he
did
in
naples
or
palermo
if
they
refuse
his
demands
stabbing
or
show
that
he
has
lost
none
of
his
ferocity
where
they
are
of
the
most
ignorant
type
he
threatens
them
with
the
evil
eye
the
curse
of
god
or
even
with
sorceries
the
number
of
italians
who
can
be
thus
terrorized
is
astonishing
of
course
the
mere
possibility
of
such
things
argues
a
state
of
mediaevalism
but
mere
mediaevalism
would
be
comparatively
unimportant
did
it
not
supply
the
principal
element
favorable
to
the
growth
of
the
mala
vita
apprehended
with
so
much
dread
by
many
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
now
what
are
the
phases
of
the
mala
vita
the
camorra
the
black
hand
the
mafia
which
are
observable
in
the
united
states
and
which
may
reasonably
be
anticipated
in
the
future
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
safely
said
that
of
the
camorra
in
its
historic
sense
the
camorra
of
the
ritual
of
the
capo
in
testa
and
capo
in
trino
highly
organized
with
a
body
of
officers
acting
under
a
supreme
head
there
is
no
trace
indeed
as
has
already
been
explained
this
phase
of
the
camorra
save
in
the
prisons
is
practically
over
even
in
naples
but
of
the
mala
vita
there
is
evidence
enough
every
large
city
where
people
exist
under
unwholesome
conditions
has
some
such
phenomenon
in
palermo
we
have
the
traditional
mafia
a
state
of
mind
if
you
will
ineradicable
and
naples
festers
with
the
camorra
as
with
a
venereal
disease
its
whole
body
politic
infected
with
it
so
that
its
very
breath
is
foul
and
its
moral
eyesight
astigmatized
in
paris
we
find
the
apache
abortive
offspring
of
prostitution
and
brutality
the
twin
brother
of
the
camorrista
in
new
york
there
are
the
gangs
composed
of
pimps
thugs
cheap
thieves
and
of
criminals
which
rise
and
wane
in
power
according
to
the
honesty
and
efficiency
of
the
police
and
who
from
time
to
time
hold
much
the
same
relations
to
police
captains
and
inspectors
as
the
various
gangs
of
the
neapolitan
camorra
do
to
commissaries
and
delegati
of
the
public
safety
corresponding
to
these
we
have
the
black
hand
gangs
among
the
italian
population
of
our
largest
cities
sometimes
the
two
coalesce
so
that
in
the
second
generation
we
occasionally
find
an
italian
like
paul
kelly
leading
a
gang
composed
of
other
italians
and
tough
guys
of
all
nationalities
but
the
genuine
black
hander
the
real
camorrist
or
mafiuoso
works
alone
or
with
two
or
three
of
his
curiously
enough
there
is
a
society
of
criminal
young
men
in
new
york
city
who
are
almost
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
apaches
of
paris
they
are
known
by
the
euphonious
name
of
waps
or
jacks
these
are
young
who
allow
themselves
to
be
supported
by
one
or
two
women
almost
never
of
their
own
race
these
pimps
affect
a
peculiar
cut
of
hair
and
dress
with
velvet
collar
not
unlike
the
camorrist
and
have
manners
and
customs
of
their
own
they
frequent
the
lowest
order
of
and
are
easily
known
by
their
picturesque
styles
of
dancing
of
which
the
most
popular
is
yclept
the
nigger
they
form
one
variety
of
the
many
gangs
that
infest
the
city
are
as
quick
to
flash
a
knife
as
the
apaches
and
as
a
cult
by
themselves
form
an
interesting
sociological
study
the
majority
of
the
followers
of
the
mala
vita
the
black
handers
are
not
actually
of
italian
birth
but
belong
to
the
second
generation
as
children
they
avoid
school
later
haunt
pool
parlors
and
saloons
and
soon
become
infected
with
a
desire
for
easy
money
which
makes
them
glad
to
follow
the
lead
of
some
experienced
capo
maestra
to
them
he
is
a
sort
of
and
they
readily
become
his
clients
in
crime
taking
their
wages
in
experience
or
whatever
part
of
the
proceeds
he
doles
out
to
them
usually
the
boss
tells
them
nothing
of
the
inner
workings
of
his
plots
they
are
merely
instructed
to
deliver
a
letter
or
to
blow
up
a
tenement
the
same
name
is
used
by
the
black
hander
for
his
assistant
or
apprentice
who
actually
commits
a
crime
as
that
by
which
he
was
known
under
the
bourbons
in
in
those
early
days
the
member
of
the
camorra
was
known
as
a
picciotto
the
apprentice
or
helper
of
the
black
hander
is
termed
a
picciott
in
the
clipped
dialect
of
the
south
but
the
picciotto
of
new
york
is
never
raised
to
the
grade
of
camorrista
since
the
organization
of
the
camorra
has
never
been
transferred
to
this
country
instead
he
becomes
in
course
of
time
a
sort
of
bully
or
bad
man
on
his
own
hook
a
criminal
swell
who
does
no
manual
labor
rarely
commits
a
crime
with
his
own
hands
and
lives
by
his
brain
such
a
one
was
micelli
palliozzi
arrested
for
the
kidnapping
of
the
scimeca
and
sabello
children
mentioned
above
a
dandy
who
did
nothing
but
swagger
around
the
italian
quarter
generally
each
capo
maestra
works
for
himself
with
his
own
handful
of
followers
who
may
or
may
not
enjoy
his
confidence
and
each
gang
has
its
own
territory
held
sacred
by
the
others
the
leaders
all
know
each
other
but
never
trespass
upon
the
others
preserves
and
rarely
attempt
to
blackmail
or
terrorize
any
one
but
italians
they
gather
around
them
associates
from
their
own
part
of
italy
or
the
sons
of
men
whom
they
have
known
at
home
thus
for
a
long
time
costabili
was
leader
of
the
calabrian
camorra
in
new
york
and
held
undisputed
sway
of
the
territory
south
of
houston
street
as
far
as
canal
street
and
from
broadway
to
the
east
river
on
september
last
costabili
was
caught
with
a
bomb
in
his
hand
and
he
is
now
doing
a
bit
up
the
river
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
the
italian
criminal
and
his
american
offspring
have
a
sincere
contempt
for
american
criminal
law
they
are
used
by
experience
or
tradition
to
arbitrary
police
methods
and
prosecutions
unhampered
by
rules
of
evidence
when
the
italian
crook
is
actually
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
at
home
that
he
will
go
is
generally
a
foregone
conclusion
there
need
be
no
complainant
in
italy
the
government
is
the
whole
thing
there
but
in
america
if
the
criminal
can
reach
the
complaining
witness
or
call
him
off
he
has
nothing
to
worry
about
this
he
knows
he
can
easily
do
through
the
terror
of
the
camorra
and
thus
he
knows
that
the
chances
he
takes
are
comparatively
small
including
that
of
conviction
if
he
is
ever
tried
by
a
jury
of
his
american
peers
who
are
loath
to
find
a
man
guilty
whose
language
and
motives
they
are
unable
to
understand
all
this
the
young
camorrist
is
perfectly
aware
of
and
gambles
on
one
of
the
unique
phenomena
of
the
mala
vita
in
america
is
the
class
of
italians
who
are
known
as
men
of
honor
these
are
native
italians
who
have
been
convicted
of
crime
in
their
own
country
and
have
either
made
their
escape
or
served
their
terms
some
of
these
may
have
been
counterfeiters
at
home
they
come
to
america
either
as
stokers
sailors
stewards
or
stowaways
and
while
they
can
not
get
passports
it
is
surprising
how
lax
the
authorities
are
in
permitting
their
escape
the
spirit
of
the
italian
law
is
willing
enough
but
its
fleshly
enforcement
is
curiously
weak
those
who
have
money
enough
manage
to
reach
france
or
holland
and
come
over
first
or
the
main
fact
is
that
they
get
here
law
or
no
law
once
they
arrive
in
america
they
realize
their
opportunities
and
actually
start
in
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
they
work
hard
they
become
honest
they
may
have
been
camorrists
or
mafiusi
at
home
but
they
are
so
no
longer
they
are
on
the
level
and
stay
so
only
they
are
men
of
honor
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
simply
that
they
keep
their
mouths
eyes
and
ears
shut
so
far
as
the
mala
vita
is
concerned
they
are
not
against
it
they
might
even
assist
it
passively
many
of
these
erstwhile
criminals
pay
through
the
nose
for
respectability
the
camorrist
after
his
kind
the
mafius
after
his
kind
sometimes
the
banker
who
is
paying
to
a
camorrist
is
blackmailed
by
a
mafius
he
straightway
complains
to
his
own
bad
man
who
goes
to
the
and
says
in
effect
here
what
are
you
doing
do
you
know
is
under
my
protection
oh
answers
the
mafius
is
he
well
if
that
is
so
i
leave
him
alone
as
long
as
he
is
paying
for
protection
by
somebody
the
reader
will
observe
how
the
silence
of
the
man
of
honor
is
not
remotely
associated
with
the
omerta
as
a
rule
however
the
men
of
honor
form
a
privileged
and
negatively
righteous
class
and
are
let
strictly
alone
by
virtue
of
their
evil
past
the
number
of
south
italians
who
now
occupy
positions
of
respectability
in
new
york
and
who
have
criminal
records
on
the
other
side
would
astound
even
their
compatriots
even
several
business
men
bankers
journalists
and
others
have
been
convicted
of
something
or
other
in
italy
occasionally
they
have
been
sent
to
jail
more
often
they
have
been
convicted
in
their
absence
condannati
in
contumacia
and
dare
not
return
to
their
native
land
sometimes
the
offences
have
been
serious
others
have
been
merely
technical
at
least
one
popular
italian
banker
in
new
york
has
been
convicted
of
murder
but
the
matter
was
arranged
at
home
so
that
he
treats
it
in
a
humourous
vein
two
other
bankers
are
fugitives
from
justice
and
at
least
one
editor
most
of
these
men
are
really
respectable
citizens
of
course
some
of
them
are
a
bad
lot
but
they
are
known
and
avoided
yet
the
fact
that
even
the
better
class
of
italians
in
new
york
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
phenomena
surrounding
the
mala
vita
is
favorable
to
the
spread
of
a
certain
amount
of
camorrist
activity
there
are
a
number
of
influential
bosses
or
capi
maestra
who
are
ready
to
undertake
almost
any
kind
of
a
job
for
from
twenty
dollars
up
or
on
a
percentage
here
is
an
illustration
a
italian
importer
in
new
york
city
was
owed
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
by
an
other
italian
to
whom
he
had
loaned
the
money
without
security
and
who
had
abused
his
confidence
finding
that
the
debtor
intended
to
cheat
him
out
of
the
money
although
he
could
easily
have
raised
the
amount
of
the
debt
had
he
so
wished
the
importer
sent
for
a
camorrist
and
told
him
the
story
you
shall
be
paid
said
the
camorrist
two
weeks
later
the
importer
was
summoned
to
a
cellar
on
mott
street
the
camorrist
conducted
him
down
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
a
flaring
on
a
barrel
showed
the
room
crowded
with
italians
and
the
debtor
crouching
in
a
corner
the
camorrist
motioned
to
the
terrified
victim
to
seat
himself
by
the
barrel
no
word
was
spoken
and
amid
deathly
silence
the
man
obeyed
at
last
the
camorrist
turned
to
the
importer
and
said
this
man
owes
you
three
thousand
dollars
i
believe
the
importer
nodded
pay
what
you
justly
owe
ordered
the
camorrist
slowly
the
reluctant
debtor
produced
a
roll
of
bills
and
counted
them
out
upon
the
at
five
hundred
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
camorrist
go
on
directed
the
latter
so
the
other
with
beads
of
sweat
on
his
brow
continued
until
he
reached
the
two
mark
here
the
bills
seemed
exhausted
the
importer
by
this
time
began
to
feel
a
certain
reticence
about
his
part
in
the
matter
there
might
be
some
widows
and
orphans
somewhere
the
bad
man
looked
inquiringly
at
him
and
the
importer
mumbled
something
to
the
effect
that
he
would
let
it
go
at
that
but
the
bad
man
misunderstood
what
his
client
had
said
and
ordered
the
bankrupt
to
proceed
so
he
did
proceed
to
pull
out
another
thousand
dollars
from
an
inside
pocket
and
add
it
to
the
pile
on
the
the
camorrist
nodded
picked
up
the
money
recounted
it
and
removed
three
hundred
dollars
handing
the
rest
to
the
importer
i
have
deducted
the
camorra
said
he
the
bravos
formed
a
line
along
the
cellar
to
the
door
and
as
the
importer
passed
on
his
way
out
each
removed
his
hat
and
wished
him
a
buona
sera
that
importer
certainly
will
never
contribute
toward
a
society
for
the
purpose
of
eradicating
the
black
hand
from
the
city
of
new
york
he
says
it
is
the
greatest
thing
he
knows
but
the
genuine
camorrist
or
mafius
would
be
highly
indignant
at
being
called
a
black
hander
his
is
an
ancient
and
honorable
profession
he
is
no
common
criminal
but
a
man
peculiarly
sensitive
in
matters
of
honor
who
for
a
consideration
will
see
that
others
keep
their
honorable
agreements
the
writer
has
received
authoritative
reports
of
three
instances
of
extortion
which
are
probably
prototypes
of
many
other
varieties
the
first
is
interesting
because
it
shows
a
mafius
plying
his
regular
business
and
coming
here
for
that
precise
purpose
there
is
a
large
wholesale
lemon
trade
in
new
york
city
and
various
growers
in
italy
compete
for
it
not
long
past
a
italian
of
good
appearance
and
address
rented
an
office
in
the
world
building
his
name
on
the
door
bore
the
suffix
agent
he
was
indeed
a
most
effective
one
and
he
secured
practically
all
the
lemon
business
among
the
italians
for
his
principals
for
he
was
a
famous
capo
ma
mafia
and
his
customers
knew
that
if
they
did
not
buy
from
the
growers
under
his
protection
that
something
might
and
very
probably
would
happen
to
their
families
in
or
near
palermo
at
any
rate
few
of
them
took
any
chances
in
the
matter
and
his
trip
to
america
was
a
financial
success
in
much
the
same
way
a
notorious
crook
named
lupo
forced
all
the
retail
italian
grocers
to
buy
from
him
although
his
prices
were
considerably
higher
than
those
of
his
competitors
even
americans
have
not
been
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
camorrist
methods
there
is
a
sewing
machine
company
which
sells
its
machines
to
italian
families
on
the
instalment
plan
a
regular
agent
solicits
the
orders
places
the
machines
and
collects
the
initial
dollar
but
the
moment
a
subscriber
in
mulberry
street
falls
in
arrears
his
or
her
name
is
placed
on
a
black
list
which
is
turned
over
by
this
enterprising
business
house
to
a
collector
who
is
none
other
than
the
leading
camorrist
bad
man
or
black
hander
of
the
neighborhood
a
knock
on
the
door
from
his
fist
followed
by
the
connotative
expression
on
his
face
results
almost
uniformly
in
immediate
payment
of
all
that
is
due
needless
to
say
he
gets
his
camorra
a
good
one
on
the
money
that
otherwise
might
never
be
obtained
it
is
probable
that
we
should
have
this
kind
of
thing
among
the
italians
in
america
even
if
the
neapolitan
camorra
and
the
sicilian
mafia
had
never
existed
for
it
is
the
precise
kind
of
crime
that
seems
to
be
spontaneously
generated
among
a
suspicious
ignorant
and
superstitious
people
the
italian
is
keenly
alive
to
the
dramatic
sensational
and
picturesque
he
loves
to
intrigue
and
will
imagine
plots
against
him
when
none
exists
if
an
italian
is
late
for
a
business
engagement
the
man
with
whom
he
has
his
appointment
will
be
convinced
that
there
is
some
conspiracy
afoot
even
if
his
friend
has
merely
been
delayed
by
a
block
on
the
subway
thus
he
is
a
good
subject
for
any
wily
lago
that
happens
along
the
italians
in
america
are
the
most
thrifty
of
all
our
immigrant
citizens
in
five
years
their
deposits
in
the
banks
of
new
york
state
amounted
to
over
one
hundred
million
dollars
the
local
italian
crooks
avail
themselves
of
the
universal
fear
of
the
vendetta
and
let
it
be
generally
known
that
trouble
will
visit
the
banker
or
importer
who
does
not
come
across
handsomely
in
most
cases
these
black
handers
are
with
a
pretty
general
reputation
as
bad
men
it
is
not
necessary
for
them
to
phrase
their
demands
the
tradesman
who
is
honored
with
a
morning
call
from
one
of
this
gentry
does
not
need
to
be
told
the
object
of
the
visit
the
mere
presence
of
the
fellow
is
a
threat
and
if
it
is
not
acceded
to
the
front
of
the
building
will
probably
be
blown
out
by
a
dynamite
bomb
in
the
course
of
the
next
six
weeks
whenever
the
gang
of
which
the
bad
man
is
the
leader
can
get
around
to
it
and
the
bad
man
may
perhaps
have
a
still
badder
man
who
is
preying
upon
him
very
often
one
of
these
leaders
or
bosses
will
run
two
or
three
groups
all
operating
at
the
same
time
they
meet
in
the
back
rooms
of
saloons
behind
locked
doors
under
pretence
of
wishing
to
play
a
game
of
zecchinetta
unmolested
or
in
the
gloaming
in
the
middle
of
a
city
park
or
undeveloped
property
on
the
outskirts
there
the
different
members
of
the
gang
get
their
orders
and
stations
and
perhaps
a
few
dollars
advance
wages
it
is
naturally
quite
impossible
to
guess
the
number
of
successful
and
unsuccessful
attempts
at
blackmail
among
italians
as
the
amount
of
undiscovered
crime
throughout
the
country
at
large
is
incomputable
no
word
of
it
comes
from
the
lips
of
the
victims
who
are
in
mortal
terror
of
the
vendetta
of
meeting
some
casual
stranger
on
the
street
who
will
significantly
draw
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
across
his
throat
there
is
rather
more
chance
to
find
and
convict
a
kidnapper
than
a
so
that
as
a
means
of
extortion
is
less
popular
than
the
mere
demand
for
the
victim
money
or
his
life
on
the
other
hand
it
is
probably
much
more
effective
in
accomplishing
its
result
but
america
will
not
stand
for
kidnapping
and
although
the
latter
occurs
occasionally
the
number
of
cases
is
insignificant
compared
with
those
in
which
dynamite
is
the
chief
factor
in
there
were
bomb
outrages
reported
in
new
york
city
there
were
seventy
arrests
and
nine
convictions
during
the
present
year
there
have
been
about
sixty
bomb
cases
but
there
have
been
none
since
september
since
detective
carrao
captured
rizzi
a
picciott
in
the
act
of
lighting
a
bomb
in
the
hallway
of
a
tenement
house
this
case
of
rizzi
is
an
enlightening
one
for
the
student
of
social
conditions
in
new
york
for
rizzi
was
no
orsini
not
even
a
guy
fawks
nor
yet
was
he
an
outlaw
in
his
own
name
he
was
simply
a
pronounced
who
did
what
he
was
told
in
order
that
some
other
man
who
did
know
why
might
carry
out
a
threat
to
blow
up
somebody
who
had
refused
to
be
blackmailed
it
is
practically
impossible
to
get
inside
the
complicated
emotions
and
motives
that
lead
a
man
to
become
an
understudy
in
dynamiting
rizzi
probably
got
well
paid
at
any
rate
he
was
constantly
demonstrating
his
fitness
to
do
big
things
in
a
big
way
and
be
received
into
the
small
company
of
the
elect
to
go
forth
and
blackmail
on
his
own
hook
and
hire
some
other
picciott
to
set
off
the
bombs
whoever
the
capo
maestra
that
rizzi
worked
for
he
was
not
only
a
villain
but
a
brainy
one
the
gang
hired
a
store
and
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
the
milk
business
they
carried
the
bombs
in
the
steel
trays
holding
the
milk
bottles
and
cans
and
in
the
costume
of
peaceful
vendors
of
the
lacteal
fluid
they
entered
the
tenements
and
did
their
damage
to
such
as
failed
to
pay
them
tribute
the
manner
of
his
capture
was
dramatic
a
real
milkman
for
whom
rizzi
had
worked
in
the
past
was
marked
out
for
slaughter
he
had
been
blown
up
twice
already
while
he
slept
his
wife
heard
some
one
moving
in
the
hall
looking
out
through
a
small
window
she
saw
the
fumble
with
something
and
then
turn
out
the
gas
on
the
landing
her
husband
awakened
by
her
exit
and
return
asked
sleepily
what
the
matter
was
i
saw
rizzi
out
in
the
hall
she
answered
it
was
put
out
the
light
in
a
moment
the
milkman
was
out
of
bed
and
gazing
with
his
wife
into
the
street
they
saw
rizzi
come
down
with
his
tray
and
pass
out
of
sight
so
did
a
couple
of
italian
detectives
from
headquarters
who
had
been
following
him
and
now
at
his
very
heels
watched
him
enter
another
tenement
take
a
bomb
from
his
tray
and
ignite
a
time
fuse
they
caught
him
with
the
thing
alight
in
his
hand
meanwhile
the
other
bomb
had
gone
off
and
blown
up
the
milkman
tenement
there
is
some
ancient
history
in
regard
to
these
matters
which
ought
to
be
retold
in
the
light
of
modern
knowledge
for
example
the
case
of
patti
the
sicilian
banker
he
had
a
prosperous
institution
in
which
were
deposited
the
earnings
of
many
italians
poor
and
wealthy
gang
got
after
him
and
demanded
a
large
sum
for
protection
but
patti
had
a
disinclination
to
give
up
and
refused
at
the
time
his
refusal
was
attributed
to
high
civic
ideals
and
he
was
lauded
as
a
hero
anyhow
he
defied
the
mafia
laid
in
a
stock
of
revolvers
and
rifles
and
rallied
his
friends
around
him
but
the
news
got
abroad
that
lupo
was
after
patti
and
there
was
a
run
on
patti
bank
it
was
a
big
run
and
some
of
the
depositors
gesticulated
and
threatened
for
patti
could
pay
it
all
out
in
a
minute
then
there
was
some
kind
of
a
row
and
patti
and
his
friends
claiming
that
the
mafia
had
arrived
opened
fire
killing
one
man
and
wounding
others
the
newspapers
praised
patti
for
a
brave
and
stalwart
citizen
maybe
he
was
after
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
however
he
disappeared
with
all
his
depositors
money
and
now
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
man
he
killed
was
a
depositor
and
not
a
black
hander
the
police
are
still
looking
for
him
this
case
seems
a
fairly
good
illustration
of
the
endless
opportunity
for
possible
in
a
state
of
society
where
extortion
is
permitted
to
exist
where
the
laws
are
not
enforced
where
there
is
a
higher
sanction
than
the
code
whether
patti
was
a
good
or
a
bad
man
he
might
easily
have
killed
an
enemy
in
revenge
and
got
off
on
the
mere
claim
that
the
other
was
blackmailing
him
just
as
an
american
in
some
parts
of
our
country
can
kill
almost
anybody
and
rely
on
being
acquitted
by
a
jury
provided
he
is
willing
to
swear
that
the
deceased
had
made
improper
advances
to
his
wife
the
prevention
of
kidnapping
and
the
other
allied
manifestations
of
the
black
hand
depends
entirely
upon
the
activity
of
the
police
particularly
the
italian
detectives
who
should
form
an
inevitable
part
of
the
force
in
every
large
city
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
never
dreamed
of
a
real
italian
peril
or
more
accurately
a
real
sicilian
peril
until
about
the
year
then
we
woke
up
to
what
was
going
on
it
had
already
gone
a
good
way
and
started
in
to
put
an
end
to
it
petrosino
did
put
an
end
to
much
of
it
and
at
the
present
time
it
is
largely
sporadic
yet
there
will
always
be
a
halo
about
the
heads
of
the
real
camorrists
and
mafiusi
the
alfanos
and
the
rapis
in
the
eyes
of
their
countrymen
in
the
united
states
occasionally
one
of
these
big
guns
arrives
at
an
american
port
of
entry
coming
via
havre
or
liverpool
having
made
his
exit
from
italy
without
a
passport
then
the
camorrists
of
new
york
and
brooklyn
get
busy
for
a
month
or
so
raising
money
for
the
boys
at
home
and
knowing
that
they
will
reap
their
reward
if
ever
they
go
back
the
popular
method
of
collecting
is
for
the
principal
capo
maestra
or
temporary
boss
of
mulberry
street
to
give
a
banquet
at
which
all
friends
must
be
present
at
five
dollars
per
head
no
one
cares
to
be
conspicuous
by
reason
of
his
absence
and
the
hero
returns
to
italy
with
a
draft
on
naples
or
palermo
meanwhile
the
criminal
driven
out
of
his
own
country
has
but
to
secure
transportation
to
new
york
to
find
himself
in
a
rich
field
for
his
activities
and
once
he
has
landed
and
observed
the
demoralization
often
existing
from
political
or
other
reasons
in
our
local
forces
of
police
and
our
uncertain
methods
of
administering
justice
particularly
where
the
defendant
is
a
foreigner
he
rapidly
becomes
convinced
that
america
is
not
only
the
country
of
liberty
but
of
license
to
commit
crime
most
italian
crooks
come
to
the
united
states
not
merely
some
time
or
other
but
at
intervals
practically
all
of
the
camorrist
defendants
on
trial
at
viterbo
have
been
in
the
united
states
and
all
will
be
here
soon
again
after
their
discharge
unless
steps
are
taken
to
keep
them
out
luckily
it
is
a
fact
that
so
much
has
been
written
in
american
newspapers
and
periodicals
in
the
past
few
years
about
the
danger
of
the
black
hand
and
the
criminals
from
south
italy
that
the
authorities
on
the
other
side
have
allowed
a
rumor
to
be
circulated
that
the
climate
of
south
america
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
persons
whose
lungs
have
become
weakened
from
confinement
in
prison
in
fact
at
the
present
time
more
italian
criminals
seek
asylum
in
the
argentine
than
in
the
united
states
theoretically
of
course
as
no
convict
can
procure
a
passport
none
of
them
leave
italy
at
all
but
that
is
one
of
the
humors
of
diplomacy
the
approved
method
among
the
continental
countries
of
europe
of
getting
rid
of
their
criminals
is
to
induce
them
to
move
on
a
lot
of
them
keep
moving
on
until
they
land
in
america
of
course
the
police
should
be
able
to
cope
with
the
black
hand
problem
and
with
a
free
use
of
italian
detectives
who
speak
the
dialects
and
know
their
quarry
we
may
gradually
in
the
course
of
fifteen
years
or
so
see
the
entire
disappearance
of
this
particular
criminal
phenomenon
but
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
several
tons
of
cure
petrosino
claimed
not
boastfully
that
he
could
with
proper
deportation
laws
behind
him
exterminate
the
black
hand
throughout
the
united
states
in
three
months
but
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned
a
solution
of
the
problem
exists
a
solution
so
simple
that
only
a
statesman
could
explain
why
it
has
not
been
adopted
long
years
ago
the
statutes
in
force
at
ellis
island
permit
the
exclusion
of
immigrants
who
have
been
guilty
of
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
in
their
native
land
but
do
not
provide
for
the
compulsory
production
of
the
applicants
penal
certificate
under
penalty
of
deportation
every
italian
emigrant
is
obliged
to
secure
a
certified
document
from
the
police
authorities
of
his
native
place
giving
his
entire
criminal
record
or
showing
that
he
has
had
none
and
without
it
he
can
not
obtain
a
passport
for
several
years
efforts
have
been
made
to
insert
in
our
immigration
laws
a
provision
that
every
immigrant
from
a
country
issuing
such
a
certificate
must
produce
it
before
he
can
be
sure
of
admission
to
the
united
states
if
this
proposed
law
should
be
passed
by
congress
the
exclusion
of
italian
criminals
would
be
almost
automatic
but
if
it
or
some
similar
provisions
fails
to
become
law
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
we
may
well
anticipate
a
camorra
of
some
sort
in
every
locality
in
our
country
having
a
large
italian
population
yet
government
moves
slowly
and
action
halts
while
diplomacy
sagely
shakes
its
head
over
the
official
cigarette
a
bill
amending
the
present
law
to
this
effect
has
received
the
enthusiastic
approval
of
the
immigration
authorities
and
of
the
president
at
first
the
italian
officials
here
and
abroad
expressed
themselves
as
heartily
in
sympathy
with
this
proposed
addition
to
the
excluded
classes
but
once
the
bill
was
drawn
and
submitted
to
congress
some
of
these
same
officials
entered
violent
protests
against
it
on
the
ground
that
such
a
provision
discriminated
unfairly
against
italy
and
the
other
countries
issuing
such
certificates
the
result
of
this
has
been
to
delay
all
action
on
the
bill
which
is
now
being
held
in
committee
meanwhile
the
black
hander
is
arriving
almost
daily
and
we
have
no
adequate
laws
to
keep
him
out
