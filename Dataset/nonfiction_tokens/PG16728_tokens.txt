preface
this
book
a
reprint
of
a
successful
english
publication
has
been
so
enlarged
as
to
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
new
it
has
been
carefully
revised
by
a
reverend
gentleman
who
for
some
time
filled
the
chair
of
physics
and
chemistry
in
one
of
our
colleges
recent
inventions
and
improvements
are
described
in
a
simple
popular
style
so
as
to
be
easily
understood
by
all
and
short
notices
are
given
of
prominent
inventors
and
scientists
the
paragraphs
relating
to
doctrinal
matters
conform
in
every
respect
to
the
teachings
of
the
church
a
feature
which
will
commend
the
book
to
every
teacher
is
the
definitions
of
difficult
words
and
terms
following
the
paragraphs
in
which
such
words
occur
technical
language
is
avoided
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
enable
young
pupils
to
become
familiarly
acquainted
with
the
various
phenomena
of
nature
the
leading
characteristics
and
general
history
of
the
objects
of
the
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
kingdoms
and
the
fundamental
truths
of
the
arts
and
sciences
the
illustrations
are
of
a
superior
order
and
a
very
complete
index
which
will
be
appreciated
by
every
teacher
supplements
the
book
in
a
word
no
pains
have
been
spared
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
work
and
render
it
an
important
auxiliary
in
the

what
is
dew
moisture
collected
from
the
atmosphere
by
the
action
of
cold
during
the
day
the
powerful
heat
of
the
sun
causes
to
arise
from
the
earth
and
water
a
moist
vapor
which
after
the
sun
sinks
below
the
horizon
is
condensed
by
the
cold
and
falls
in
the
form
of
dew
dews
are
more
copious
in
the
spring
and
autumn
than
at
any
other
season
in
warm
countries
than
in
cold
ones
because
of
the
sudden
changes
of
temperature
egypt
abounds
in
dews
all
the
summer
for
the
air
being
too
hot
to
condense
the
vapors
in
the
they
never
gather
into
clouds
and
form
rain
the
line
which
bounds
the
view
on
all
sides
so
that
the
earth
and
sky
appear
to
meet
a
greek
word
from
the
verb
signifying
to
mark
boundaries
degree
of
heat
or
cold
to
cause
the
particles
of
a
body
to
approach
or
unite
more
closely
what
are
its
uses
it
cools
and
refreshes
the
vegetable
creation
and
prevents
it
from
being
destroyed
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
all
hot
countries
where
there
is
little
or
no
rain
are
therefore
blessed
with
this
provision
by
the
creator
to
render
them
luxuriant
and
inhabitable
and
the
dews
which
fall
are
so
copious
that
the
earth
is
as
deeply
soaked
with
them
during
the
night
as
if
a
heavy
rain
had
fallen
for
this
reason
also
it
is
that
we
so
often
read
in
the
bible
of
the
dew
of
heaven
being
promised
to
the
israelites
as
a
signal
favor
fertile
flourishing
remarkable
eminent
from
what
does
the
vapor
originate
vapor
is
water
combined
with
a
still
greater
quantity
of
caloric
that
is
an
imponderable
and
subtile
form
of
matter
which
causes
the
sensation
of
heat
and
which
driving
asunder
the
particles
of
the
water
renders
it
aëriform
without
sensible
weight
thin
not
dense
or
compact
a
small
portion
of
matter
having
the
form
of
air
what
is
water
the
fluid
which
covers
more
than
of
the
surface
of
our
globe
and
which
is
necessary
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
creation
for
without
water
there
would
be
neither
rain
nor
dew
and
everything
would
perish
it
is
likewise
a
necessary
beverage
for
man
and
the
inferior
animals
drink
liquor
for
drinking
in
how
many
states
do
we
find
water
in
four
solid
as
in
ice
snow
hail
fluid
as
in
its
common
form
aëriform
as
in
steam
and
in
a
state
of
union
with
other
matter
its
most
simple
state
is
that
of
ice
which
is
water
deprived
of
a
certain
portion
of
its
caloric
crystallization
then
takes
place
and
the
water
becomes
solid
and
is
called
ice
the
process
by
which
the
parts
of
a
solid
body
separated
by
solution
or
fusion
are
again
brought
into
the
solid
form
if
the
process
is
slow
the
figure
assumed
is
regular
and
bounded
by
plane
and
smooth
surfaces
the
diffusion
of
a
solid
through
some
liquid
melting
or
rendering
fluid
by
heat
from
what
cause
is
the
water
deprived
of
its
caloric
from
the
coldness
of
the
atmosphere
underneath
the
poles
of
our
globe
it
is
mostly
solid
there
it
is
similar
to
the
hardest
rocks
and
may
be
cut
with
a
chisel
like
stone
or
marble
this
great
solidity
is
occasioned
by
the
low
temperature
of
the
surrounding
air
and
in
very
cold
countries
ice
may
be
ground
so
fine
as
to
be
blown
away
by
the
wind
and
will
still
be
ice
the
extremities
or
ends
of

to
be
drawn

the
centre
of
the
earth
or
when
applied
to
the
heavens
the
two
points
directly
over
them
is
ice
the
only
instance
of
water
existing
in
a
state
of
solidity
no
it
is
found
in
a
solid
state
in
many
minerals
as
in
marble
and

necessary
clearness
the
power
of
transmitting
light
does
nature
decompose
water
in
any
of
her
operations
yes
every
living
vegetable
has
the
power
of
decomposing
water
by
a
secret
process
peculiar
to
itself
fish
too
and
all
amphibious
animals
are
gifted
with
the
same
power
separating
a
mixed
body
into
its
several
parts
able
to
live
both
in
water
and
out
of
it
of
what
use
is
this
power
to
vegetables
the
water
which
they
decompose
affords
them
nourishment
for
the
support
of
their
vital
juices
and
enables
them
by
combining
the
fluid
gases
which
compose
it
with
those
of
the
air
and
the
soil
to
form
their
different
products
while
the
superfluous
gas
is
abundantly
given
out
by
their
leaves
to
refresh
the
spent
air
and
render
it
wholesome
for
the
animals
that
breathe
it
belonging
to
life
necessary
to
existence
unnecessary
not
wanted
what
is
rain
the
condensed
aqueous
vapors
raised
in
the
atmosphere
by
the
sun
and
wind
converted
into
clouds
which
fall
in
rain
snow
hail
or
mist
their
falling
is
occasioned
by
their
own
weight
in
a
collision
produced
by
contrary
currents
of
wind
from
the
clouds
passing
into
a
colder
part
of
the
air
or
by
electricity
if
the
vapors
are
more
copious
and
rise
a
little
higher
they
form
a
mist
or
fog
which
is
visible
to
the
eye
higher
still
they
produce
rain
hence
we
may
account
for
the
changes
of
the
weather
why
a
cold
summer
is
always
a
wet

what
seasons
are
more
liable
to
rain
than
others
the
spring
and
autumn
are
generally
the
most
rainy
seasons
the
vapors
more
plentifully
in
spring
and
in
the
autumn
as
the
sun
recedes
from
us
and
the
cold
increases
the
vapors
which
lingered
above
us
during
the
summer
heats
more
easily
to
fall

retreat
what
is
snow
rain
congealed
by
cold
in
the
atmosphere
which
causes
it
to
fall
to
the
earth
in
white
flakes
snow
fertilizes
the
ground
by
defending
the
roots
of
plants
from
the
intenser
cold
of
the
air
and
the
piercing
winds
turned
by
the
force
of
cold
from
a
fluid

raised

what
is
hail
drops
of
rain
frozen
in
their
passage
through
cold
air
hail
assumes
various
figures
according
to
the
degrees
of
heat
or
cold
through
which
it
passes
being
sometimes
round
flat
what
is
the
atmosphere
the
mass
of
aëriform
fluid
which
encompasses
the
earth
on
all
sides
it
extends
about
fifty
miles
above
its
surface
air
is
the
elastic
fluid
of
which
it
is
composed
having
the
power
of
springing
back
or
recovering
its
former
figure
after
the
removal
of
any
external
pressure
which
has
altered
that
figure
when
the
force
which
compresses
the
air
is
removed
it
expands
and
resumes
its
former
state
what
are
the
uses
of
air
it
is
necessary
to
the
of
man
since
without
it
neither
he
nor
any
animal
or
vegetable
could
exist
if
it
were
not
for
atmospheric
air
we
should
be
unable
to
converse
with
each
other
we
should
know
nothing
of
sound
or
smell
or
of
the
pleasures
which
arise
from
the
variegated
prospects
which
surround
us
it
is
to
the
presence
of
air
and
carbonic
acid
that
water
owes
its
agreeable
taste
boiling
deprives
it
of
the
greater
part
of
these

what
is
wind
air
in
motion
with
any
degree
of
velocity
what
is
lightning
the
effect
of
electricity
in
the
clouds
a
flash
of
lightning
is
simply
a
stream
of
the
electric
fluid
passing
from
the
clouds
to
the
earth
from
the
earth
to
the
clouds
or
from
one
cloud
to
another
lightning
usually
strikes
the
highest
and
most
pointed
objects
as
high
hills
trees
spires
masts
of
ships
what
is
thunder
the
report
which
accompanies
the
electrical
union
of
the
clouds
or
the
echoes
of
the
report
between
them
and
the
earth
thunder
is
caused
by
a
sudden
discharge
of
electrical
matter
collected
in
the
air
by
which
vibrations
are
produced
which
give
rise
to
the
sound
what
is
electricity
one
of
those
agents
passing
through
the
earth
and
all
substances
without
giving
any
outward
signs
of
its
presence
when
at
rest
yet
when
active
often
producing
violent
and
destructive
effects
it
is
to
be
a
highly
elastic
fluid
capable
of
moving
through
matter
clouds
owe
their
form
and
existence
probably
to
it
and
it
passes
through
all
substances
but
more
easily
through
metals
water
the
human
body
which
are
called
conductors
than
through

is
electricity
confined
to
their
surfaces
as
the
outside
may
be
electric
and
the
inside
in
a
state
of
neutrality
the
heat
produced
by
an
electric
shock
is
very
powerful
but
is
only
accompanied
by
light
when
the
fluid
is
obstructed
in
its
passage
the
production
and
condensation
of
vapor
is
a
great
source
of
the
atmospheric
electricity
the
act
of
making
any
body
dense
or
compact
that
is
of
bringing
its
parts
into
closer
union
in
what
other
sense
is
the
term
electricity
employed
this
term
is
also
employed
to
designate
that
important
branch
of
knowledge
which
relates
to
the
properties
shown
by
certain
bodies
when
rubbed
against
or
otherwise
brought
in
contact
with
each
other

many
other
substances
used
by
us
in
the
common
affairs
of

are
susceptible
of

furnishes
a
remarkable
instance
when

almost
any

color
the
better
can
be
excited
by
rubbing
it
with

in
the
direction
of

a
process
which
is
accompanied
with
a
slight

noise
and
in
the

by
flashes
of

the
substances
just
mentioned
as
highly
electric
are
however
merely
specimens
all
objects
without
exception
most
probably
are
capable
of
being
electrically
excited

some
require
more
complicated
contrivances
to
produce
it
than
others

machine
it
is
made
of
different
forms
and
sizes
for
common
purposes
those
of
the
simplest
form
are
the
best
a
common
form
of
the
machine
consists
of
a
circular
plate
of
glass
which
can
be
turned
about
a
horizontal
axis
by
means
of
a
suitable
handle
this
plate
turns
between
two
supports

formerly
this

called
a

with
several
rows
of

this
though
not

now
is
still
occasionally
employed

spinning

these
we
find
mentioned
in
sacred
history
and
they
have
been
used
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
yet
discovered
the
natives
of
india
and
of
some
other
parts
of
the
world
still
employ
this
simple
invention
what
was
the
next
improvement
the
invention
of

invented
by
a
weaver
named
hargreaves
but
the
greatest
improvement
in
the
art
of
spinning
was
effected
by
arkwright
in
these
two
inventions
were
combined
and
again
improved
upon
in
so
that
by
the
new
plan
the
material
can
be
converted
into
thread
in
a
considerably
shorter
space
of
time
than
in
the
ancient
mode
leaving

merely
to

does
weaving
differ
according
to
the
material
used
the
principle
of
weaving
is
the
same
in
every
kind
of
fabric
and
consists
in
forming
any
kind
of
thread
into
a
flat
web
or
cloth
by
interlacing
one
thread
with

the
various
appearances
of

arise
as
much
from
the
modes
in
which
the

are
interwoven
as
from
the
difference
of

not
the
employment
of

in
the
manufacture
of
clothing
of
great
antiquity
in
the
earliest
records
we
possess
of
the
arts
of

wool
is
mentioned
as
forming
a
chief
article
in

it
is
spoken
of
in
the
bible
as
a
common
material
for
cloth
as
early
as
the
time
of
moses
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
are
well
known
to
have
possessed
this
art
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
manufacture
was
established
in
many
parts
of
europe
particularly
in
spain
from
which
country
it
extended
itself
to
france
and
italy
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
introduced
into
england
by
its
conquerors

established
at

being
desirous
of
improving
their
woollen
manufacture
invited
over
the
flemings
by
the
offer
of
various
privileges
to
establish
manufactories
there
the
skill
of
these
people
soon
effected
a
great
improvement
in
the
english
fabrics
so
that
there
no
longer
remained
any
occasion
for
the
exportation
of
english
wool
into
flanders
to
be
manufactured
into
fine
cloth
and
a
law
was
passed
by
the

the

succeeded
better
there
than
in

some

no
manna
is
nothing
more
than
the
nutritious
juices
of

what
confirms
this
is
that
the
very
hot

are
always
those
which
are

it
was
much
esteemed
formerly
in

but
it
has
now
gone

do
honey
the
bedouin
arabs
consume
great
quantities
considering
it
the

they
are
said
to
have

at
briançon
in

they
collect
it
from
all
sorts
of

that
grow
there
and
the
inhabitants
observe
that
such
summers
as
produce
the
greatest
quantities
of

are
very
fatal
to

each
day
over
that
of
the

about
four
inches

these
cuts
or
incisions
are
nearly
two
inches
long
and
half
an
inch
deep
when
the

directly
begins
to
flow
at
first
like

congealing
as
it
flows
it
soon
becomes

what
is
the

a
machine
that

which
is
very
great
especially
when
as
in

one
of
the
most
valuable
presents
that
the

of
life
have
received
from

is
of
the
greatest
importance
in

thus
trade
is
facilitated

we
are
enabled

more
days
may
now
be
performed
in
four
or
five
hours
belonging
to
mechanics
to
whom
are
we
indebted
for
its
invention
its
invention
is
by
most
writers
ascribed
to
the
marquis
of
worcester
an
englishman

but
it
does
not
appear
that
the
inventor
could
ever
interest
the
public
in
favor
of
this
or
his

were
made
at
philadelphia
in
three
years
before
the

but
owing
to
repeated
accidents
to

the
want
of

and
competent
mechanics
for
the
necessary
repairs
she
was
abandoned

made
his

belongs
the
honor

to
have
been
very
early
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
in
the
chapter
of

abram
is
spoken
of
as
very
rich
in

arabia
was
famed
for
the
fineness
and
quality
of
its
gold
in
the
time
of
solomon
the
gold
of
ophir
seems
to
have
been
much
esteemed
as
it

it
is
capable
of
still
further
extension
but
its
tenacity
is
inferior
even
to
that

a
silver
wire
of
an
inch
thick
will
scarcely
bear
a

will
support
nearly
double
that

like
some
other
metals
it
is
unalterable
by

state
is
tin
generally
found
tin
is
sometimes
found
native
or
pure
but
most
frequently
alloyed
with
other
metals
the
working
of
tin
mines
is
attended
with
much
difficulty
on
account
of
their
great
depth
and
the
hard
rocks
which
obstruct
the
progress
of
the
miners
who
are
often
obliged
to
cut
through
them
this
metal
is
very
useful
in
the
making
of
domestic
utensils
for

for
various
other
purposes

it
is
the
heaviest
of
the

being
eleven
times
heavier
than

loses
its
malleability
in
proportion
as
it
is
heated
as
soon
as
it

lead
is
a
metal
of
great
utility
it
easily
melts

hence
it
is
employed
in

what
is
peculiar
to

is
so
poisonous
that
the

what
is
platina
a
metallic
substance
more
recently

and
analogous
to
the
perfect

especially
gold
many
of
whose

whence
is
its

derived
it
is
the
diminutive
of
silver
to

it
appears
very
similar
platina
being
a

a
word
lessening
the

it
obtained
mostly
from

platina
is
capable
of
being
alloyed
with
all

are
there
any

to
the
metals
known

by
the
ancients
the
chemical
science
of
later

has
by
decomposing
other

added
more
than
thirty
to
the
number
of
metals
some
of
them
more
curious
than
useful
several
of
these
are
lighter
than
water
all
the
metals
possess
different
and
distinct
properties
from
each
other
they
are
divided
into
two
classes
the
malleable
and
the
brittle
metals
these
last
may
be
again
divided
into
two
others
namely
those
which
are
easily
and
those
which
are
with

fused
what
do
you
mean
by
metallurgy
the
art
of
obtaining
metals
from
their
ores
comprising
the
processes
of
assaying
refining
smelting
by
assaying
is
meant
the
particular
manner
of
examining
an
ore
or
mixed
metal
according
to
its
nature
so
as
to
discover
not
only
what
metals
and
what
proportions
of
metal
may
be
obtained
from
it
but
also
what
other
mineral
substances
or
earths
may
be
contained
in
it
what
do
the
terms
refining
and
smelting
signify
refining
is
the
art
of
rendering
the
metal
free
from
all
impurities
smelting
means
the
melting
of
a
metal
from
its
ore
in
a
smelting
furnace
in
order
to
separate
the
metallic
parts
from
the
sulphur
arsenic
and
the
earthy
and
stony
substances
with
which
they
may
be
combined

burning
almost
entirely
away
with
a

it
is
abundantly
diffused
in
many
places
especially
where
metallic
minerals
are
found

in
those
districts
where
subterranean

the
greatest
quantity
which
exists
naturally
is

which
qualities
enable
us
to
procure
it
from

are
not
its
uses
very
extensive
yes
both
in
the
arts
and
in
chemistry
it
is
well
known
to
be
a
principal
ingredient
in
the

the
largest
quantities
are
brought
from
saxony
in
irregular
masses
which
are
afterwards
melted
and
cast
into
small
rolls
there
are
about
four
species
of
sulphur
namely
the
yellow
native
sulphur
which
in
its
purest
state
is
clear
and
of
a
pale
straw
color
found
in
the
gold

and
some
other
places
the
green
native
sulphur
which
is
harder
than
the
other
is
found
in
small
masses
this
sort
is
chiefly
confined
to
mount
vesuvius
and
the
grey
native
sulphur
common
in
iceland
and
many
other
places
native

is
also
found
at
the
coal
mines
near
richmond
virginia
in
connecticut
pennsylvania
and
other
parts
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
most
rare

common
sulphur
such
as
is
used
in

and
the
arts
is
of
a
pale
yellow
color
and
possesses
a
peculiar
and
disagreeable
smell
particularly
when
heated
or
rubbed
this
is
mostly
extracted
from
the
metallic
sulphurets
and
is
commonly
called
brimstone
it

and
valued
for
its
beautiful
lustre
it
is
the
hardest
of
all
stones
as
well
as
the
most
valuable
the
most
esteemed
are
colorless
a
diamond
in
its
natural
state
as
it
comes
out
of
the
mine
and
before
it
is
cut
is
called
rough
because
it
has
no
brilliancy
but
is
covered
with
an
earthy
crust
the
diamond
is
the
adamant
of
the
ancients
hence
the
expression
hard
as
adamant
from
its
being
the
hardest
substance
in
nature
the
cutting
of
diamonds
is
a
work
of
labor
and
requires
great
skill
the
polishing
is
performed
by
a
mill
of
simple
construction
where
are
they
mostly
found
in
yellow
ochreous
earths
in
mines
and
likewise
in
torrents
which
have
torn
them
from
their
beds
in
former
times
all
the
diamonds
that
were
known
were
brought
from
the
famous
mines
of
golconda
in
hindostan
the
islands
of
molucca
and
borneo
have
also
produced
many
valuable
stones
the
diamond
mines
of
golconda
are
now
so
exhausted
that
they
are
not
thought
worth
the
expense
of
working
these
gems
are
now
brought
chiefly
from
brazil
in
south
america
what
is
meant
by
ochreous
consisting
of
ochre
a
kind
of
earth
with
a
rough
and
dusty
surface
composed
of
fine
soft
clayey
particles
which
readily
separate
in
water
there
are
various
colored
ochres
as
red
yellow
blue
green
they
are
very
useful
in
many
of
the
arts
what
term
is
used
to
denote
the
quality
of
the
diamond
in
speaking
of
the
value
of
diamonds
we
distinguish
them
as
diamonds
of
the
first
water
meaning
those
which
possess
the
greatest
perfection
and
purity
which
ought
to
be
that
of
the
clearest
drop
of
water
when
they
fall
short
of
this
perfection
they
are
said
to
be
of
the
second
or
third
water
and
so
on
till
the
stone
may
be
properly
called
a
colored
one
what
is
the
ruby
a
beautiful
gem
of
a
red
color
in
its
perfect
state
it
is
of
great
value
the
ruby
is
often
found
perfectly
pure
and
free
from
all
spots
or
blemishes
but
its
value
is
much
more
frequently
lessened
by
them
especially
in
the
larger
stones
it
is
very
hard
being
second
only
to
the
diamond
in
this
respect
and
is
often
naturally
so
bright
and
pure
on
the
surface
as
to
need
no
polishing
it
is
often
worn
in
rings
in
its
rough
or
native
state
the
color
of
rubies
varies
from
the
deepest
to
the
palest
red
all
having
more
or
less
of
a
purplish
tinge
which
is
more
plainly
perceived
in
the
deeper
colored
specimens
than
in
the
paler
ones
where
are
rubies
found
they
are
mostly
found
in
gold
mines
we
have
the
true
rubies
only
from
the
east
the
isle
of
ceylon
has
long
been
celebrated
for
these
gems
they
are
found
in
a
river
which
descends
from
the
mountains
they
are
brighter
and
more
beautiful
than
those
obtained
in
other
parts
but
are
very
rare
some
crystals
are
frequently
found
tinged
with
the
true
color
of
the
ruby
but
these
want
its
lustre
and
hardness
describe
the
emerald
it
is
a
precious
stone
of
a
beautiful
transparent
green
color
and
when
in
a
state
of
perfection
nearly
equal
to
the
ruby
in
hardness
the
finest
and
best
are
found
in
america
especially
among
the
mountains
of
peru
they
are
also
obtained
from
a
few
places
in
the
east
these
gems
are
often
counterfeited
as
are
most
of
the
precious
stones
there
being
even
false
diamonds
the
genuine
may
be
known
by
their
extreme
hardness
and
brilliancy
imitated
with
a
view
to
defraud
true
real
what
is
the
turquois
a
beautiful
blue
stone
it
is
one
of
the
softest
of
the
gems
and
some
varieties
are
often
used
for
seals
as
they
admit
of
being
engraved
upon
the
turquois
is
easily
imitated
and
that
often
so
perfectly
as
to
render
it
very
difficult
to
distinguish
the
counterfeit
from
the
true
gem
in
what
countries
are
they
found
the
oriental
turquois
comes
from
persia
the
indies
and
some
parts
of
turkey
the
turquois
is
also
found
in
various
parts
of
europe
as
germany
spain
and
france
what
is
engraving
the
art
of
cutting
metals
or
precious
stones
and
representing
thereon
figures
letters
and
devices
the
term
is
however
more
particularly
applied
to
the
art
of
producing
figures
or
designs
on
metal
for
the
purpose
of
being
subsequently
printed
on
paper
the
ancients
are
well
known
to
have
excelled
in
engraving
on
precious
stones
many
specimens
have
been
preserved
which
surpass
anything
of
the
kind
produced
by
the
moderns
this
art
is
frequently
alluded
to
in
the
bible
engraving
on
wood
according
to
some
authors
was
introduced
into
europe
from
china
by
venetian
merchants
it
is
certain
the
art
was
practised
in
eastern
and
northern
italy
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
the
invention
of
engraving
has
been
ascribed
to
a
goldsmith
of
florence
about
the
year
that
which
is
formed
by

representation
of

engraving
the
subject
is
drawn
on
a
block
of
box
or
wood
with
a
pencil
or
with
a
pen
and
indian
ink
the
wood
is
then
cut
away
so
as
to
leave
the
lines
which
have
been
drawn
as
raised
parts
the
ink
is
next
applied
and
by
pressing
damp
paper
upon
the

are
obtained
albert
durer
a
celebrated
painter
of
germany
brought
the
art
of
engraving
on
wood
and
metal
and
taking
off
impressions
on
paper
to
great
perfection
how
is
engraving
on
copper
steel
performed
this
sort
of
engraving
is
performed
with
a
instrument
called
a
by
means
of
which
figures
landscapes
are
traced
upon
a
flat
surface
of
the
metal
the
lines
are
then
filled
with
ink
or
a
similar
composition
and
the
paper
pressed
on
the
plate
when
taken
off
an
exact
copy
of
the

is
impressed
upon

cochineal
insects
and

what
is
lithography
a
species
of
engraving
on
stone
from
which
impressions
can
be
taken
much
more
expeditiously
and
economically
than
from
metal
the
process
depends
upon
the
following
principles
first
the
facility
with
which
calcareous
stones
imbibe
water
second
the
power
of
oily
substances
to
repel
water
when
drawings
are
executed
upon
the
stone
with
crayons
composed
of
oily
materials
and
the
surface
of
the
stone
is
washed
over
with
water
the
moisture
is
imbibed
by
the
stone
but
repelled
from
the
engraving
and
when
the
ink
which
also
contains
oily
substances
is
applied
it
adheres
only
to
the
drawing
and
not
to
the
other
portions
of
the
stone
the
block
is
then
passed
through
a
press
and
the
impressions
are
taken
off
as
many
as
perfect

have
been
obtained
from
a

to
be

allusions
made
to

in
the
old
testament
were
not
only
known
to
the
ancients
but
were
regarded
by
them
as
costly
and
precious
gems
how
do
they
get
the

which
contain
them
by
diving
under

they
take
into
their

and
carry
them
ashore
where
they
deposit
them
in
heaps
they
are
then
left
till
they
become
putrid
this
being
necessary
in
order
to
remove
the

architecture

what
is
meant
by
architecture
the
art
of
building
or
erecting
edifices
fit
for
the
habitation
of
man
to
defend
him
from
the
weather
and
for
his
domestic
comfort
and
convenience
for
devotion
trade
and
other
purposes
and
for
the
use
of
civilized
life
in
every
capacity
state
condition
is
not
this
an
art
of
great
antiquity
it
is
almost
as
ancient
as
human
society
the
changes
of
the
seasons
first
led
men
to
build
themselves
huts
or
cabins
into
which
they
might
retire
for
shelter
in
process
of
time
their
manner
of
building
gradually
improved
and
habitations
were
constructed
of
more
stately
forms
and
elegant
proportions
and
greater
skill
and
variety
were
displayed
in
their
ornaments
hence
arose
the
five
orders
or
manners
of
building
of
what
were
the
first
huts
composed
probably
of
the
branches
of
trees
driven
into
the
ground
and
covered
with
mud
and
stubble
at
length
as
men
became
more
expert
they
placed
trunks
of
trees
upright
and
laid
others
across
them
to
sustain
the
outer
coverings
from
this
they
took
the
hint
of
a
more
regular
architecture
and
built
edifices
of
brick
and
stone
the
trunks
of
trees
which
supported
their
dwellings
gave
them
a
notion
of
pillars
or
columns
which
they
afterwards
erected
of
more
durable
materials
among
uncivilized
tribes
at
this
day
some
reside
underground
having
their
dirty
dwellings
entirely
closed
during
the
winter
months
in
warmer
regions
their
habitations
are
built
of
stakes
leaves
and
turf
in
the
shape
of
a
soldier
tent
in
africa
their
kraals
or
huts
are
constructed
in
this
manner
but
of
a
circular
form
with
a
hole
at
the
top
to
let
out
the
smoke
in
many
of
the
south
sea
islands
the
natives
when
first
discovered
had
progressed
still
further
having
learnt
to
elevate
the
roofs
on
poles
and
to
fill
in
the
sides
of
their
houses
with
boughs
or
rushes
mud
or
sods
most
likely
a
building
idea
lasting
what
people
are
represented
by
the
ancient
writers
as
having
brought
the
art
of
building
to
a
greater
state
of
perfection
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
of
tyre
to
whom
solomon
had
recourse
for
workmen
to
build
the
temple
isaias
in
his
chapter
speaks
of
the
tyrians
and
egyptians
as
having
brought
it
to
a
great
degree
of
magnificence
as
may
be
drawn
from
the
various
accounts
handed
down
to
us
and
the
remains
of
their
obelisks
pyramids
what
is
an
obelisk
a
very
high
and
slender
pyramid
raised
as
an
ornament
in
some
public
place
and
frequently
covered
with
inscriptions
and
hieroglyphics
this
kind
of
monument
appears
to
be
very
ancient
they
were
first
made
use
of
to
declare
to
posterity
the
principal
precepts
of
philosophy
to
mark
the
hours
of
the
day
by
the
shadows
which
they
cast
on
the
ground
and
in
to
immortalize
the
actions
of
heroes

perpetuate
the
memory
of

have

all

the
five

of
ornamental
architecture
invented
by
the
ancients
at
different
times
and
on
different
occasions
are
of
grecian
and
italian
origin
they
are
the
tuscan
the
doric
the
ionic
the
corinthian
and
the
composite
each
possessing
its
peculiar
form
and
beauty
and
found
in

the
principal
buildings
of

christian
world
professing
the
religion
of

the
term
is
applied
to

who
believe
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
be
the
only
true
god
and
saviour
of

all
the
species
of
ornamental
building
confined
to
those
nations
already
mentioned
by

means
besides
the
grecian
and
roman
orders
other
civilized
nations
possess
their
separate
styles
as

hindoos
chinese
moors

nothing
can
be
more
grand
harmonious
and
picturesque
than
each
of
these
in
the
beautiful
specimens
which
are
to
be
seen
in
their
several
countries
the
saxons
also
had
a
simple
style
of
architecture
distinguished
by
arches
and
massive
plain
columns
the
normans
too
invented
a
beautiful
kind
called
the
gothic
distinguished
by
its
lightness
and
the
number
of
its
ornaments
and
by
its
pointed
arches
and
pillars
carved

like
a

inhabitants
of
saxony
a
portion
of
germany
only
half
circular
describe
the
five
orders
of
architecture
the
tuscan
from
tuscany
is
the
most
simple
and
devoid
of
ornament
and
its
columns
or
pillars
are
plain
and
massive
the
doric
from
the
dorians
in
greece
is
durable
and
noble
in
appearance
having
its
columns
plain
like
the
tuscan
but
the
upper
parts
more
ornamental
the
ionic
from
iona
in
greece
is
neither
so
plain
as
the
doric
nor
so
richly
elegant
as
the
corinthian
but
is
distinguished
from
the
first
two
orders
by
having
its
columns
or
pillars
fluted
instead
of
plain
and
the
upper
part
of
them
called
the
capitals
adorned
by
the
figures
of
rams
horns
carved
on
them
the
corinthian
is
very
rich
and
delicate
with
fluted
pillars
and
the
tops
beautifully
ornamented
with
leaves
the
invention
of
this
order
is
ascribed
to
callimachus
a
corinthian
sculptor
the
composite
is
compounded
of
the
other
four
it
is
very
much
like
the
corinthian
and
is
also
called
the
roman
or
italian
order
free
from
destitute
what
is
sculpture
the
art
of
cutting
or
carving
wood
stone
and
other
materials
and
forming
of
them
various
figures
or
representations
of
men
beasts
and
other
objects
the
term
is
mostly
limited
to
carving
images
or
statues
in
stone
this
art
is
of
great
antiquity
the
sacred
writings
inform
us
of
it
in
many
passages
as
for
instance
in
those
in
which
are
mentioned
laban
images
carried
away
by
rachel
the
golden
calf
of
the
israelites
sculpture
as
an
art
is
probably
more
ancient
than
painting
what
country
was
the
most
highly
celebrated
for
its
sculpture
greece
which
produced
many
celebrated
sculptors
of
whom
the
most
eminent
were
phidias
an
athenian

great
master

art
who
lived
in
the
time
of

years
before

sicyon
near
corinth
and
praxiteles
a
native
of

grecia
what
event
proved
fatal
to
this
art
the
death
of
alexander
the
great
was
followed
by
a
visible
decline
in
all
the
fine
arts
but
the
fatal
blow
to
their
existence
was
given
by
the
success
of
the
conquering
romans
who
reduced
greece
to
a
roman
province
was
sculpture
always
performed
in
stone
no
at
first
statues
and
other
figures
were
formed
of
wood
or
baked
clay
afterwards
of
stone
marble
and
metals
though
these
last
were
not
brought
to
any
degree
of
perfection
till
about
three
hundred
years
before
christ
the
greeks
were
famous
for
their
works
in
ivory
the
great
master
of
the
art
of
carving
statues
in
it
was
phidias
what
progress
did
the
romans
make
in
sculpture
sculpture
during
their
early
history
existed
rather
as
a
plant
of
foreign
growth
partially
cultivated
by
them
than
as
a
native
production
of
their
own
land
they
collected
indeed
some
of
the
most
exquisite
samples
of
grecian
sculpture
and
invited
to
their
capital
the
yet
remaining
sculptors
of
greece
by
whose
labors
not
only
rome
itself
was
embellished
but
also
many
of
the
cities
of
asia
minor
spain
and
gaul
then
under
the
roman
dominion
yet
the
taste
for
sculpture
does
not
appear
to
have
been
cultivated
in
any
measure
corresponding
with
the
advantages
thus
afforded
them
in
the
study
of
the
best
models
of
the
art
the
best
works
were
produced
by
greek
artists
and
chiefly
athenian
while
the
attempts
of
the
romans
were
unskilfully
executed
the
ancient
name
of
france
pattern
did
it
always
continue
thus
no
from
the
time
of
the
emperor
constantine
sculpture
and
the
rest
of
the
fine
arts
gradually
revived
while
inspired
perhaps
with
a
taste
for
sculpture
by
means
of
the
scattered
remains
of
grecian
art
the
roman
artists
drew
at
the
same
time
from
their
own
resources
and
were
by
no
means
servile
copyists
of
the
sculptors
of
a
former
age
the
first
academy
of
the
art
was
founded
at
florence
in
and
at
the
close
of
the
same
century
sculpture
was
firmly
established
in
italy
and
itinerant
sculptors
not
unskilful
in
their
art
wandered
from
thence
to
germany
france
and
even
to
england
the
most
eminent
master
of
the
art
was
michael
angelo
born
in
who
was
also
a
painter
and
architect
from
his
time
to
the
latter
end
of
the
last
century
sculpture
again
gradually
declined
but
under
canova
a
native
of
possagno
in
the
venetian
alps
it
revived
he
was
born
in
besides
the
above
mentioned
were
a
number
of
others
of
various
degrees
of
talent
as
well
as
some
still
living
slavish
mean
wandering
when
was
the
knowledge
of
sculpture
introduced
into
england
at
the
time
of
its
conquest
by
the
romans
but
the
art
appears
to
have
been
very
rude
and
imperfect
from
the
time
of
the
norman
invasion
and
still
further
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
an
improvement
however
began
to
show
itself
in
british
sculpture
but
it
is
probable
that
most
of
their
best
architectural
and
sculptural
works
were
executed
by
foreigners
members
of
those
societies
of
wandering
sculptors
before
mentioned
under
edward
the
third
the
art
appears
to
have
been
much
cultivated
by
englishmen
it
is
well
known
that
two
italian
sculptors
were
employed
in
england
during
the
sixteenth
century
john
of
padua
a
pupil
of
michael
angelo
was
master
of
works
to
henry
the
eighth
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
first
english
sculptors
flourished
although
their
works
are
of
a
very
low
order

may
the

be
considered
as
commencing
with
banks
born
in
and
bacon
born
in
these
were
in
every
respect
english
artists
but
the
most
eminent
worker
in
the
art
which
that
country
has
yet
produced
was
john
flaxman
born
in
our
own
country
also
may
boast
of
sculptors
of
superior
talents
and
from
the
beautiful
specimens
of
the
art
which
have
appeared
the
attainment
of
a
high
degree
of
excellence
in
it
is
to
be
anticipated
the
act
of
arriving
at
or
reaching
expected
foreseen
give
me
a
short
account
of
this
art
in
germany
france
and
spain
in
these
countries
as
in
england
and
the
united
states
during
their
early
history
many
of
the
best
works
were
executed
by
italians
germany
appears
to
have
made
little
progress
in
sculpture
before
the
seventeenth
century
since
that
period
it
has
produced
sculptors
of
some
eminence
although
it
is
more
celebrated
for
its
writers
on
the
art
than
for
artists
of
eminence
in
its
practice
in
france
sculptors
of
some
talent
are
mentioned
as
early
as
the
sixteenth
century
girardon
and
puget
were
the
most
celebrated
artists
of
this
period
spanish
history
gives
a
long
list
of
native
sculptors
from
the
commencement
of
the
same
century
but
many
of
them
are
but
little
known
beyond
their
own
country
berruguete
a
pupil
of
michael
angelo
appears
to
have
founded
the
first
regular
school
of
the
art
paul
de
cespides
and
in
the
eighteenth
century
philip
de
castro
were
the
most
eminent
among
them
when
was
the
use
of
money
first
introduced
it
is
not
known
with
certainty
there
is
however
reason
to
believe
that
both
gold
and
silver
were
very
early
used
as
money
in
egypt
and
asia
it
was
afterwards
introduced
into
carthage
and
greece
whence
it
was
brought
to
rome
and
from
that
city
spread
gradually
westward
through
all
the
roman
dominions
before
the
use
of
money
was
introduced
the
only
means
of
trade
was
by
barter
or
the
exchange
of
one
commodity
for
another
a
custom
long
retained
by
uncivilized
nations
in
time
however
men
discovered
the
necessity
of
something
which
would
enable
them
to
trade
with
greater
facility
the
first
mention
of
money
is
in
the
time
of
abraham
who
we
are
told
in
the
bible
paid
four
hundred
sides
of
silver
of
common
current
money
for
a
burying
place
generally
received
passing
from
hand
to
hand
where
was
carthage
carthage
now
tunis
was
a
commercial
city
situated
on
the
northern
coast
of
africa
which
long
contended
for
the
dominion
of
the
mediterranean
with
the
romans
but
after
three
wars
it
was
taken
and
destroyed
by
the
roman
general
scipio
africanus
in
the
year
before
christ
carrying
on
commerce
or
trade
of
what
substances
was
money
usually
made
of
metals
especially
the
precious
metals
because
they
possess
great
value
in
small
bulk
may
be
kept
for
any
length
of
time
without
loss
and
their
value
although
not
altogether
invariable
yet
generally
speaking
changes
only
by
slow
degrees
and
is
less
susceptible
of
fluctuation
than
that
of
most
other
articles
at
different
times
and
amongst
various
nations
however
other
things
in
the
scarcity
of
metal
have
been
substituted
for
it
as
shells
wood
leather
paper
or
even
pasteboard
on
extraordinary
occasions
unsteadiness
a
wavering
of
what
form
was
money
generally
made
the
form
of
money
has
been
more
various
than
its
materials
the
ancient
britons
used
as
money
rings
or
bars
of
iron
or
tin
the
lacedemonians
used
iron
bars
quenched
with
vinegar
the
money
of
most
nations
usually
bore
an
impression
peculiar
to
themselves
as
for
instance
the
sicle
of
the
jews
was
marked
with
the
golden
pot
of
manna
on
one
side
and
aaron
rod
on
the
other
other
coins
with
the
figures
of
animals
in

coins
were
either
round
irregular
or
square
have
the
terms
money
and
coin
the
same
signification
not
exactly
by
money
is
understood
any
matters
such
as
metal
wood
leather
glass
horn
paper
fruits
shells
which
have
currency
as
a
medium
in
commerce
coin
is
a
particular
species
always
made
of
metal
and
struck
off
according
to
a
certain
process
called
coining
it
is
not
of
equal
antiquity
with
money
in
fact
the
very
commodities
themselves
were
the
first
moneys
that
is
were
current
one
for

by
way
of

coin
is
a
piece
of
metal
converted
into
money
by
the
impression
of
certain
marks
or
figures
thereon
the
first
coining
of
silver
took
place
at
rome
two
hundred
and
and
of
gold
two
hundred
and
six
years
before
christ
the
romans
after
the
commonwealth
stamped
their
coins
with
the
image
of
the
reigning
emperor
which
custom
was
followed
by
most
civilized
nations
coins
were
and
are
frequently
struck
in
commemoration
of
a
particular
event
or
celebrated
person
when
was
the
use
of
stamped
coin
introduced
into
britain
after
the
arrival
of
the
romans
in
that
island
the
natives
imitated
them
coining
both
gold
and
silver
with
the
images
of
their
kings
stamped
upon
them
but
the
romans
when
they
subdued
the
nation
suppressed
also
their
coins
and
obliged
them
to
use
their
own
hence
the
number
of
roman
coins
found
among
the
relics
of
antiquity
in
that
island
put
aside
hindered
from
circulation
remains
what
does
the
first
coined
money
in
ancient
britain
appear
to
have
been
copper
money
but
after
the
arrival
of
the
saxons
in
england
scarcely
any
copper
money
was
used
for
many
centuries
nor
did
it
become
common
till
it
was
first
used
in
scotland
and
ireland
in
what
is
a
mint
a
place
established
by
public
authority
for
coining
money
in
the
united
states
the
first
mint
was
in
philadelphia
branches
have
been
established
in
other
parts
of
the
union
in
most
countries
the
privilege
of
coining
money
is
regarded
as
a
prerogative
of
the
sovereign
power
formerly
in
great
britain
cities
towns
and
even
individuals
were
allowed
to
coin
money
for
the
convenience
of
trade
but
now
this
is
forbidden
except
at
the
mint
in
the
tower
of
london
what
is
meant
by
navigation
the
science
or
art
by
which
the
mariner
is
taught
to
conduct
his
ship
from
one
place
to
another
some
perhaps
will
consider
the
formation
and
use
of
the
ark
as
a
first
step
towards
the
invention
of
this
art
but
it
is
an
erroneous
idea
because
the
direction
and
means
for
accomplishing
this
immense
work
were
afforded
by
god
for
the
preservation
of
righteous
noe
and
his
family
besides
nothing
is
recorded
of
any
means
or
of
any
necessity
for
its
occupants
it
to
any
particular
place
or
from
one
place
to
another
no
intention
of
this
sort
is
apparent
the
ark
being
merely
a
vast
shelter
rendered
capable
of
floating
on
the
water
wrong
in
error
manifest
made
to
appear
what
probably
gave
the
first
idea
of
navigation
accident
most
likely
showed
that
wood
always
floats
and
on
the
fallen
trunk
of
a
tree
perhaps
some
one
ventured
beyond
his
depth
away
from
the

the
trunk
of
a
tree
hollowed
out
for
a
more
convenient
position
of
the

usually
found
among
uncivilized
nations
to
this
day
from
this
rude
beginning
at
great
intervals
of
time
and
a
slow
pace
of
improvement
the
art
has
at
length
arrived
at
its
present
state
of
advancement
what
nation
first
applied
this
art
to
the
purposes
of
trade
the
phenicians
especially
those
of
tyre
their
capital
city
and
sidon
were
the
first
who
adapted
it
to
the
purposes
of

and
constructed

make

to
foreign
countries
the
poverty
and
narrowness
of
their
land
as
well
as
their
vicinity
to
two
or
three
good
ports
and
their
natural
genius
for
traffic
urging
them
to
seek
foreign
supplies

about
the

even

to

the
carthaginians

to
have
been
the

for
the

to
recover

between
the
years
and
what
causes
led
to
these
wars
many
circumstances
contributed
to
give
rise
to
them
they
were
undertaken
first
with
a
view
to
protecting
the
devout
christian
pilgrims
who
were
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
the
venerable
places
where
our
saviour
had
lived
taught
suffered
and
triumphed
from
the
fury
and
avarice
of
the
heathens
secondly
with
a
view
to
getting
possession
of
the
holy
land
itself
and
of
annexing
it
to
christendom
and
thirdly
to
break
down
the
power
of
mohammedanism
and
to
elevate
the
cross
in
triumph
and
victory
over
palestine
an
excessive
desire
of
gain
adding
joining
what
badge
or
sign
was
worn
by
those
who
engaged
in

they
distinguished
themselves
by
crosses
of
different
colors
worn
on
their
clothes
from
which
they
took
the
name
of
croisés
or
each
nation
wore
different

for

the
english
had
white

the
french
red

so
on

what
invention
is
the
art
of

much
indebted
to
that
of
the
mariner

in
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
from
this
period
may
be
dated
the
present
perfection
of
this
useful

you
have
given
me
an
account
of
the
restoration
of
navigation
in
southern
europe
did
not
the
inhabitants
of
the
north
also
turn
their
attention
to
it
yes
about
the
same
time
a
new
society
of
merchants
was
formed
in
the
northern
parts
which
not
only
carried
commerce
to
the
greatest
perfection
of
which
it
was
capable
till
the
discovery
of
the
indies
but
also
formed
new
codes
of
useful
laws
for
its
regulation
books
or

forth
certain
laws
or
rules
respecting

books
of

are
navigation
and
commerce
inseparably
connected
with
each
other
it
may
be
considered
as
a
general
maxim
that
their
union
is
so
intimate
that
the
fall
of
one
inevitably
draws
after
it
that
of
the
other
and
that
they
will
always
either
flourish
or
decline
together
may
be
seen
by
examining
the
reason
of
their
passing
successively
from
the

to
the
portuguese

from

the
earliest
accounts
of
music
which
we
possess
are
to
be
found
in
the
bible
in
which
the
state
of
the
world
before

jubal
is
said
to
have
been
the
father
of
them
that
play
upon
the
harp
and

but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
these
instruments
at
all
resembled
the
harp
and
organ
of
modern
times
musical
instruments
in
the
times
of
david
and
solomon
were
used
in
religious
services
and
music
was
certainly
employed
by
the
jews
on
many
other
occasions
as
at
funerals
and
weddings
at

and
at

of

the
ancient
egyptians
who
were
so
celebrated
for
their
talents
in
music
that
the
distinguished
philosophers
of
greece
braved
many
dangers
in
order
to
study
the
science
in
egypt
and
this
at
a
period
when
the
egyptians
were
far
from
being
in
the
same
high
state
of
civilization
as
their
forefathers
had
been
in
earlier
times
the
history
and
monuments
of
ancient
egypt
have
many
accounts
and
representations
of
musical
instruments
and
remains
of
these
have
lately
been
discovered
so
that
we
have
ocular
demonstration
both
of
their
existence
and
form
freedom
from
barbarity

politeness
possession

knowledge
and
the
arts

known
or
seen
by
the
eye
the
act
of
proving
with
certainty
in
how
many
divisions
may
musical
instruments
be
arranged
there
are
three
kinds
namely
instruments
as
the
trumpet
and
the
organ
instruments
as
the
harp
or
lyre
violin
and
instruments
of
in
which
the
sound
is
produced
by
striking
a
sonorous
body
as
for
instance
the
drum
bells
which
of
these
three
kinds
was
the
first
invented
it
is
impossible
at
the
present
day
to
decide
which
but
it
is
most
probable
that
instruments
with
strings
were
the
last
invented
of
the
three
kinds
and
it
is
most
likely
that
of
those
in
which
sound
is
produced
by
the
application
of
wind
the
trumpet
or
horn
was
first
used
this
instrument
in
its
rudest
form
was
ready
fashioned
to
the
hand
of
man
the
horn
of
a
ram
or
of
an
ox
or
some
of
the
larger
kinds
of
were
soon
discovered
to
possess
the
power
of
producing
sound
by
being
blown
into
through
a
small
hole
at
the
pointed
end
what
improvement
in
this
instrument
would
naturally
follow
mankind
having
discovered
the
property
possessed
by
a
hollow
tube
of
producing
a
certain
sound
soon
found
that
the
note
varied
according
to
the
length
and
capacity
of
the
tube
a
much
greater
improvement
soon
after
took
place
it
was
discovered
that
one
tube
answered
the
purpose
of
many
by
boring
holes
in
the
course
of
its
length
and
producing
various
musical
sounds
by
stopping
with
the
fingers
certain
of
these
holes
most
of
our
modern
wind
instruments
are
but
improvements
on
the
ancient
inventions
a
pipe
a
long
hollow
body
was
not
vocal
music
used
before
the
invention
of
instrumental
music
namely
that
produced
by
the
human
voice
so
called
to
distinguish
it
from
that
produced
by
instruments
was
undoubtedly
the
first
for
man
had
not
only
the
various
tones
of
his
own
voice
to
make
his
observations
on
before
any
art
or
instrument
was
found
out
but
the
various
natural
strains
of
birds
to
give
him
a
lesson
in
improving
it
and
in
modulating
the
sounds
of
which
it
is
capable
forming
sound
to
a
certain
key
to
what
circumstance
did
an
ancient
poet
ascribe
the
invention
of
stringed
instruments
to
the
observation
of
the
winds
whistling
in
the
hollow
reeds
as
for
other
kinds
of
instruments
there
were
so
many
occasions
for
cords
or
strings
that
men
were
not
long
in
observing
their
various
sounds
which
might
give
rise
to
stringed
instruments
those
of
concussion
as
drums
and
cymbals
might
result
from
the
observation
of
the
naturally
hollow
noise
made
by
concave
bodies
when
struck
what
are
the
most
ancient
stringed
instruments
the
most
ancient
instruments
of
this
kind
whose
form
is
known
are
those
of
the
ancient
egyptians
among
these
the
harp
stands
one
of
the
most
celebrated
representations
of
an
egyptian
harp
was
drawn
from
a
painting
discovered
in
one
of
the
caverns
in
the
mountains
of
egyptian
thebes
by
some
travellers
it
is
called
the
theban
harp
and
has
thirteen
strings
its
form
is
extremely
elegant
this
harp
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
kind
in
use
before
and
at
the
time
of
sesostris
remains
of
egyptian
harps
of
a
more
simple
construction
with
only
four
strings
have
likewise
been
discovered
among
the
monuments
of
ancient
rome
there
are
representations
of
stringed
instruments
resembling
the
harp
but
not
equal
in
beauty
of
form
to
the
famous
egyptian
harp
already
mentioned
surpassing
others
who
was
sesostris
a
king
of
egypt
who
is
said
to
have
reigned
some
ages
before
the
siege
of
troy
he
appears
to
have
been
celebrated
for
his
conquests
and
for
the
number
of
edifices
he
erected
to
perpetuate
his
fame
to
preserve

memory
of
a

the

in

it
became
famous
for
the
ten
years
siege
it
sustained
against

the
history
of
this

is
commemorated
in

virgil
is
not
the

an
instrument
of
high
antiquity
in

yes
it
was
a
favorite
instrument
with
the
ancient
saxons
in

britain
the
celebrated
alfred
entered
the

camp
disguised
as
a
harper
because
the
harpers
passed
through
the
midst
of
the
enemy
unmolested
on
account
of
their
calling
the
same
deception
was
likewise
practised
by
several
danish
chiefs
in
the
camp
of
athelstan
the

the
bards
or
harpers
of
old
were

to
generation
the
history
of
remarkable
events
and
of
the
deeds
and
lineage
of
their
celebrated
chiefs
and
princes
the
harpers
of
britain
were
formerly
admitted
to
the
banquets
of
kings
and
nobles
their
employment
was
to
sing
or
recite
the
achievements
of
their
patrons
accompanying
themselves
on

no
nations
have
been
more
famous
for
their

what
instrument
was
famous
among
the
ancient
greeks
the
lyre
the
invention
or
rather
discovery
of
this
instrument
is
ascribed
by
them
to
their
most
celebrated
deities
it
is
supposed
to
have
originated
from
the
discovery
of
a
dead
tortoise
the
flesh
of
which
had
dried
and
wasted
so
that
nothing
was
left
within
the
shell
but
sinews
and
cartilages
these
tightened
and
contracted
on
account
of
their
dryness
were
rendered
sonorous
some
one
mercury
or
apollo
they
affirm
in
walking
along
happening
to
strike
his
foot
against
the
tortoise
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
sound
it
produced
thus
was
suggested
to
him
the
first
idea
of
a
lyre
which
he
afterwards
constructed
in
the
form
of
a
tortoise
and
strung
with
the
dried
sinews
of
dead
animals
the
stringed
instruments
already
described
were
made
to
give
out
musical
sounds

not
this

there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
but
to
name
the
country
where
it
was
first
practised
or
the
circumstances
attending
its
origin
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
historian
about
a
century
after
the
call
of
abraham
greek
and
egyptian
tradition
tells
us
of
a
colony
planted
at
sicyon
by
an
egyptian
who
brought
with
him
the
knowledge
of
painting
and
sculpture
and
founded
the
earliest
and
purest
school
of
greek
art
the
walls
of

were
adorned
with
paintings
of
different
kinds
of

ornamenting
a
kingdom
of
peloponnesus
in
ancient
greece
were
the
egyptians
acquainted
with
this
art
it
is
now
little
doubted
that
although
painting
and
sculpture
existed
in
egypt
and
were
probably
at
their
highest
condition
eighteen
centuries
before
the
christian
era
yet
at
a
still
earlier
period
these
arts
were
known
in
the
kingdom
of
ethiopia
and
it
is
considered
likely
that
the
course
of
civilization
descended
from
ethiopia
to
egypt
there
is
however
no
record
of
any
egyptian
painter
in
the
annals
of
the
art
and
it
does
not
appear
that
it
ever
flourished
in
that
country
or
that
other
nations
were
much
indebted
to

notice

among

there
is
no
allusion
made
to
the
existence
of
painting
among
this
people
and
no
proof
that
it
was
cultivated
among
them
it
is
supposed
that
the
neglect
of
this
art
arose
from
their
not
being
permitted
to
represent
any
object
by
painting
what
progress
did
the
generality
of
the
eastern
nations
make
in
this
art
the
art

among
the
phenicians
persians
and
other
eastern
nations
advanced
but
slowly
the
chinese
appear
until
a
very
recent
period
to
have
contented
themselves
with
only
so
much
knowledge
of
the
art
as
might
enable
them
to
decorate
their
beautiful
porcelain
and
other
wares
their
taste
is
very
peculiar
and
though
the
pencilling
of
their
birds
and
flowers
is
delicate
yet
their
figures
of
men
and
animals
are
distorted
and
out
of
proportion
and
of
perspective
they
seem
to
have
but
little
idea
latterly
however
a
change
has
taken
place
in
chinese
art
and
proofs
have
been
given
of
an
attempt
to
imitate
european
skill
the
japanese
figures
approach
more
nearly
to
beauty
of
style
than

their

by

their

were

first
among
the
europeans
who
taught
that
the
earth

turn
round
the

what
do
the
fine
arts
usually
include
all
those
which
are
more
or
less
addressed
to
the
sentiment
of
taste
and
whose
object
is
pleasure
these
are
more
especially
music
painting
sculpture
and
poetry
what
are
the
mechanical
arts
those
in
which
the
hand
and
body
are
more
concerned
than
the
mind
and
which
are
chiefly
cultivated
for
the
sake
of
the
profit
attending
them
to
this
class
belong
those
which
furnish
us
with
the
necessaries
of
life
and
which
are
commonly
called
trades
as
carpentry
weaving
printing
there
are
also
many
other
arts
as
the
art
of
writing
when
was
the
art
of
writing
invented
it
is
supposed
that
the
art
was
invented
before
the
deluge
it
was
certainly
practised
long
before
the
time
of
moses
there
were
doubtless
many
steps
taken
in
slow
succession
before
the
invention
of
alphabetic
writing
perhaps
the
earliest
method
might
have
been
that
which
is
still
employed
among
the
untutored
tribes
of
north
american
indians
who
record
events
by
of
the
rudest
description
was
afterwards
gradually
converted
into
the
hieroglyphical
system
which
is
still
the
only
kind
of
writing
among
the
chinese
it
is
not
known
who
invented
the
alphabetic
system
of
writing
a
flood
the
term
used
in
particular
to
denote
that
mighty
flood
of
water
with
which
god
swept
away
the
first
nations
of
the
earth
for
their
wickedness
from
alphabet
the
series
of
written
signs
of
language
called
letters
the
word
is
formed
from
the
names
of
the
first
two
letters
of
the
greek
alphabet
ignorant
unlearned
were
not
the
egyptians
quite
early
acquainted
with
this
art
yes
they
were
acquainted
with
two
or
three
kinds
of
writing
as
well
as
the
one
in
which
symbolical
characters
were
employed
which
was
not
used
for
common
purposes
on
the
contrary
such
symbols
had
something
of
a
sacred
character
about
them
being
unknown
to
the
common
people
and
only
to
be
deciphered
by
the
priests
obelisks
and
pyramids
were
the
great
national
records
and
on
these
the
hieroglyphics
were
constantly
used
because
unintelligible
to
the
people
until
expounded
by
those
who
had
the
exclusive
office
of
explaining
them
having
the
nature
of
signs
or
symbols
that
is
representations
of
different
things
read
understood
made
out
that
can
not
be
understood
explained
interpreted
were
hieroglyphics
employed
before
or
after
alphabetic
writing
they
were
undoubtedly
employed
at
first
from
necessity
not
from
choice
or
refinement
and
would
never
have
been
thought
of
if
alphabetical
characters
had
been
known
this
style
of
writing
must
be
reckoned
as
a
rude
improvement
upon
which
had
previously
been
used
hieroglyphics
were
employed
by
the
egyptian
priests
in
after
times
as
a
kind
of
sacred
writing
peculiar
to
themselves
and
serving
to
give
an
air
of
mystery
to
their
learning
and
religion
though
fallen
into
disuse
for
other
purposes
what
materials
were
employed
by
ancient
nations
in
writing
the
eastern
nations
used
tables
of
stone
brass
and
wood
so
that
the
characters
were
engraved
instead
of
being
written
in
the
usual
manner
the
instrument
used
in
writing
on
wood
was
made
of
metal
and
called
a

stone
brass
a
chisel
was
employed
when
the
bark
and
leaves
of
trees
skins
and
other
materials
of
a
more
pliant
nature
superseded
the
tables
the
chisel
and
the
style
or
stylus
gave
way
to
the
reed
and
cane
and
afterwards
to
the
quill
the

as
now
used
by
the

and
the
convenient

have
not
the
various
nations
among
whom
this
useful
art
has
been
cultivated
adopted
different
ways
of
arranging
their
written
characters
yes
the

what
is
meant
by
science
a
clear
and
certain
knowledge
of
anything
founded
on
principles
or
demonstration
the
term
is
however
more
particularly
applied
to
a
systematic
arrangement
of
the
principles
relating
to
any
branch
of
knowledge
and
is
employed
in
this
sense
in
opposition
to
art
thus
the
theoretical
knowledge
of
chemistry
is
ranked
as
a
science
but
the
practical
part
is
called
an
art
thus
it
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
a
science
sometimes
as
an
art
relating
to
action
not
merely
speculative
what
is
chemistry
a
science
which
enables
us
to
discover
the
peculiar
properties
of
natural
bodies
either
in
their
simple
or
compound
state
and
the
elementary
or
first
principles
of
which
they
are
composed
by
the
processes
of
analysis
and
combination
chemistry
treats
of
those
changes

which
are
not

mixed
a
separation
of
a
compound
body
into
the
several

of
which
it
consists
is
not
the

very
ancient
chemistry
as
far
as
it
regards
the
separating
of
metals
from
foreign
matters
in
the
ore
smelting
and
refining
them
is
of
the
highest
antiquity
it
is
even
supposed
to
have
been
understood
and
practised
in
the
antediluvian
world
before
the
flood
what
nation
appears
to
have
excelled
in
chemistry
in
early
times
the
egyptians
were
no
mean
proficients
in
many
chemical
operations
especially
in
the
arts
of
working
metals
softening
ivory
vitrifying
flints
and
imitating
precious
stones
chemistry
however
experienced
the
common
fate
of
all
the
arts
at
the
decline
of
the
eastern
empire
those
who
have
made
great
progress
in
any
art
or
science
by
whom

it
revived
after
having
long
lain
buried
the
famous
roger
bacon
revived
it
and
from
his
time
to
the
present
day
it
has
gradually
progressed
to
a
state
of
perfection
in
former
times
the
art
of
chemistry
consisted
only
in
the
knowledge
of
working
metals
but
in
latter
ages
its
bounds
have
been
greatly
enlarged
the
knowledge
of
chemistry
leads
to
many
interesting
and
important
discoveries
and
the
arts
and
manufactures
are
greatly
indebted
to
its
aid
indeed
it
is
requisite
to
be
a
good
chemist
in
order
to
attain
to
perfection
in
many
of
them
necessary
by
what
other
name
has
chemistry
been
known
it
was
sometimes
called
by
which
is
properly
understood
a
refined
and
mysterious
species
of
chemistry
formerly
much
practised
what
were
its
objects
the
discovery
of
the
art
of
converting
metals
into
gold
including
the
search
after
the
philosopher
stone
by
which
this
change
was
to
be
effected
and
the
discovery
of
a
panacea
or
medicine
for
the
cure
of
all
diseases
what
was
the
philosopher
stone
a
substance
for
numbers
of
years
eagerly
sought
for
which
was
to
convert
metals
such
as
lead
copper
into
gold
this
unknown
substance
was
called
the
philosopher
stone
probably
on
account
of
the
number
of
learned
men
who
engaged
in
the
search
after
it
illustration
united
states
signal

pike
peak
colorado
was
this
search
successful
no
but
the
delusion
lasted
several
centuries
notwithstanding
the
failures
losses
and
disappointments
of
those
engaged
in
it
indeed
so
severe
and
ruinous
were
these
in
many
instances
that
laws
were
passed
to
forbid
the
study
in
germany
many
of
the
alchemists
who
had
the
unfortunate
reputation
of
possessing
this
wonderful
stone
were
imprisoned
and
furnished
with
apparatus
till
they
should
purchase
their
liberty
by
making
an
ounce
of
gold
an
error
arising
from
false
views
a
complete
set
of
instruments
or
tools
by
which
anything
is
made
or
any
operation
performed
was
any
gold
ever
produced
by
this
method
not
a
particle
the
story
of
a
stone
having
the
property
of
converting
the
baser
metals
into
gold
being
merely
an
absurd
fable
yet
although
the
pursuits
of
alchemy
were
the
most
preposterous
that
can
be
conceived
the
ardor
with
which
they
were
followed
and
the
amazing
number
of
experiments
made
in
consequence
led
to
the
discovery
of
many
facts
to
which
chemistry
is
highly
indebted
absurd
foolish
contrary
to
nature
or
reason
you
inform
me
that
chemistry
enables
us
to
discover
the
properties
of
bodies
by
means
of
and
what
do
these
terms
imply
if
a
chemist
wishes
to
examine
the
properties
of
a
compound
body
he
proceeds
by
analysis
that
is
by
a
separation
of
the
substance
to
be
examined
into
its
constituent
parts
the
chemical
examination
of
bodies
is
generally
effected
by
producing
a
change
in
the
or
of
the
body
under
examination
this
change
is
frequently
brought
about
by
the
addition
of
some
substance
which
forms
a
combination
with
a
part
of
the
substance
examined
and
leaves
the
remainder
in
a
detached
state
by
what
do
chemists
effect
a
change
in
the
qualities
or
states
of
natural
bodies
it
is
generally
effected
by
means
of
which
has
a
tendency
to
separate
the
particles
of
bodies
from
each
other
or
by
the
or
of
some
other
matter
with
the
matter
intended
to
be
examined
the
mixture
of
two
or
more
compounds
often
produces
a
decomposition
by
means
of
chemical
a
property
which
different
species
of
matter
have
to
unite
with
each
other
and
which
is
sometimes
called
thus
it
may
be
observed
chemists
have
not
only
the
power
of
decomposing
natural
bodies
but
of
producing
by
combination
various
other
substances
such
as
are
not
found
in
the
kingdom
of
nature
what
do
you
mean
by
in
chemical
language
it
means
the
separation
of
a
compound
body
into
its
simple
elements
give
me
an
example
water
may
be
decomposed
and
reduced
into
oxygen
and
hydrogen
both
of
them
simple
substances
incapable
of
further
decomposition
is
not
the
work
of
decomposition
perpetually
going
forward
yes
and
is
one
of
the
great
agents
in
this
work
by
it
animal
and
vegetable
substances
are
converted
into
water
and
carbonic
acid
by
the
union
of
their
hydrogen
and
carbon
with
the
oxygen
of
the
air
these
in
time
are
again
absorbed
by
vegetables
and
again
decomposed
to
set
the
oxygen
at
liberty
to
produce
fresh
combustions
of
what
use
are
the
two
remaining
substances
hydrogen
and
carbon
these
are
appropriated
by
the
vegetative
organs
to
their
growth
and
nourishment
while
the
oxygen
with
which
the
carbon
was
combined
is
abundantly
given
off
to
purify
the
air
and
render
it
fit
for
the
respiration
of
animals
give
me
an
idea
of
the
mode
in
which
chemists
ascertain
the
of
bodies
by
relating
an
experiment
dissolve
a
of
sugar
of
lead
in
water
and
pour
the
clear
solution
into
a
decanter
or
large
glass
bottle
then
take
a
small
piece
of
zinc
and
twist
round
it
some
brass
or
copper
wire
so
as
to
let
the
ends
of
the
wire
depend
from
it
in
any
agreeable
form
suspend
the
zinc
and
wire
in
the
solution
which
has
been
prepared
in
a
short
time
metallic
lead
will
deposit
itself
on
the
zinc
and
along
the
wire
this
is
a
beautiful
illustration
of
chemical
affinity
the
acid
which
constitutes
a
part
of
the
sugar
of
lead
has
a
stronger
affinity
for
the
zinc
than
for
the
lead
and
consequently
will
combine
with
the
zinc
and
form
a
compound
which
remains
in
solution
while
the
lead
is
precipitated
on
the
zinc
and
wire
in
the
form
of
a
brilliant
tree
of
metal
in
chemistry
that
attraction
which
takes
place
between
the
elements
of
bodies
and
forms
compounds
what
does
the
word
nature
signify
in
the
above
sense
the
system
of
the
universe
the
creation
the
works
of
god
by
the
kingdom
of
nature
is
meant
the
world
and
all
things
in
it
nature
is
divided
into
three
kingdoms
the
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
what
are
the
different
states
of
natural
bodies
all
bodies
are
either
solid
liquid
or
aeriform
by
solid
bodies
are
meant
those
whose
parts
unite
so
firmly
as
to
resist
the
impression
or
penetration
of
other
bodies
by
liquid
those
substances
whose
parts
do
not
unite
firmly
but
have
free
motion
among
themselves
by
aeriform
fluid
substances
having
the
form
or
nature
of
air
liquid
substances
are
nothing
more
than
solids
converted
into
liquids
by
heat
a
certain
increase
of
which
would
convert
the
liquids
into
vapor
what
other
name
is
given
to
liquids
they
are
likewise
called
fluids
we
call
the
air
also
a
fluid
because
it
flows
like
a
fluid
and
light
substances
will
float
in
it
what
is
the
cause
of
bodies
floating
on
liquids
it
is
an
established
law
of
nature
that
all
substances
which
weigh
less
than
an
equal
bulk
of
any
liquid
will
float
on
the
surface
of
this
liquid
thus
a
cork
will
float
on
water
while
a
stone
sinks
to
the
bottom
the
cork
will
not
float
in
the
air
though
lighter
than
water
and
the
stone
is
not
heavier
than
the
of
the
water
but
more
so
than
a
portion
of
water
of
its
and
thus
it
sinks
in
it
stones
also
differ
in
their
weight
or
gravity
for
instance
some
of
the
asbestus
kind
are
than
water
iron
brass
indeed
nearly
all
substances
except
gold
and
platina
will
float
upon
mercury
because
they
are
lighter
than
this
liquid
what
is
the
cause
of
bodies
being
either
solid
liquid
or
aeriform
when
the
principle
of
prevails
it
causes
them
to
become
solid
when
caloric
prevails
they
become
aeriform
fluidity
is
apparently
a
medium
between
the
two
how
is
the
state
of
solidity
in
bodies
accounted
for
the
particles
of
all
bodies
are
subject
to
two
opposite
powers
and
between
which
they
remain
in
equilibrium
while
the
force
remains
strongest
the
body
remains
in
a
state
of
solidity
but
if
heat
destroys
this
force
the
particles
lose
their
cohesion
and
the
body
ceases
to
be
solid
act
of
sticking
together
union
of
the
constituent
parts
of
a
body
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
most
natural
state
of
all
bodies
solidity
for
by
the
of
caloric
with
them
we
can
reduce
most
substances
to
the
fluid
state
while
the
greatest
number
of
substances
take
a
form
by
the
loss
of
caloric
thus
water
congeals
and
forms
ice
and
even
the
gases
show
this
disposition
to
become
solid
when
they
lose
their
by
forming
some
explain
the
terms
and
repulsion
is
a
peculiar
property
in
the
particles
of
matter
which
gives
them
a
constant
tendency
to
recede
from
each
other
attraction
is
an
unknown
force
which
causes
bodies
or
their
particles
to
approach
each
other
the
particles
of
all
bodies
possess
this
property
which
causes
them
to
adhere
and
preserves
the
various
substances
around
us
from
falling
in
pieces
what
different
kinds
of
attraction
can
you
mention
attraction
may
be
distinguished
into
that
which
takes
place
between
bodies
at
sensible
distances
and
that
which
manifests
itself
between
the
of
matter
at
insensible
distances
give
an
example
of
the
first
kind
of
attraction
one
of
the
most
familiar
instances
of
attraction
at
sensible
distances
is
seen
in
the
descent
of
heavy
bodies
to
the
ground
when
a
stone
is
lifted
up
in
the
hand
the
earth
attraction
which
previously
caused
it
to
remain
at
its
surface
is
overcome
but
as
soon
as
the
hand
is
withdrawn
the
stone
falls
to
the
earth
the
force
which
causes
this
is
called
the
of
or
simply
how
is
the
second
kind
of
attraction
or
that
between
the
particles
of
bodies
subdivided
into
the
of
or
and
or
the
former
takes
place
between
particles
which
are
and
the
latter
between
those
which
are
all
the
operations
of
chemistry
are
founded
upon
the
force
of
affinity
which
nature
has
established
between
the
particles
of
different
kinds
of
matter
and
which
enables
the
chemist
to
produce
compounds
differing
more
or
less
from
the
substances
by
whose
union
they
were
formed
is
it
then
necessary
for
chemists
to
understand
the
relative
nature
of
all
substances
yes
because
the
basis
of
this
science
consists
in
an
examination
of
the
works
of
nature
an
investigation
of
the
properties
and
uses
of
all
substances
we
are
acquainted
with
and
the
study
of
the
effects
of
and
in

of
the
advantages
obtained
by
a
knowledge
of
chemistry
many
of
the
wonderful
operations
of
nature

take
place
in

around
us
are
by
its
means
revealed
to
us
in
every
manufacture

or
walk
of

the
chemist
possesses
an
advantage
over
his
unskilled
neighbor
it
is
necessary
to
the
farmer
and
gardener
as
it
explains
the
growth
of
plants
the
use
of
manures
and
their
proper
application
and
indispensable
to
the
physician
that
he
may
understand
the
animal
economy
and
the
which
certain
chemically
produce
and
the
nature
of
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
poisons
the
study
is
therefore
an
invaluable
branch
in
the
education
of
youth
it
is
useful
not
only
in
the
active
but
the
life
by
laying
the
foundation
of
an
ardent
and
inquiring
mind
even
an
everyday
walk
in
the
fields
can
be
productive
of
instruction
by
a
knowledge
of

let
us
always
remember
that
knowledge
is

what
is
attraction
by
attraction
is
meant
that
property
or
quality
in
the
particles
of
bodies
which
makes
them
tend
toward
each
other
are
there
several
kinds
of
attraction
yes
attraction
has
received
different
names
according
to
the
circumstances
under
which
it
acts
the
force
which
keeps
the
particles
of
matter
together
to
form
bodies
or
masses
is
called
attraction
of
that
which
makes
bodies
stick
together
only
on
their
surfaces
is
called
that
which
inclines
different
masses
toward
each
other
as
the
earth
and
the
heavenly
bodies
is
called
that
which
forces
the
particles
of
substances
of
different
kinds
to
unite
is
known
under
the
name
of
that
which
causes
the
needle
of
the
compass
to
point
constantly
toward
the
poles
of
the
earth
is
that
which
is
excited
by
friction
in
certain
substances
is
known
as
how
do
you
know
that
attraction
exists
through
the
whole
universe
this
great
universal
law
was
first
discovered
by
sir
isaac
newton
the
sun
and
planets
and
other
heavenly
bodies
are
only
guided
in
their
path
by
gravitation
do
we
experience
this
attraction
upon
our
earth
yes
because
our
earth
is
carried
around
the
sun
by
it
and
further
the
tides
show
it
very
clearly
what
are
the
tides
the
ebbing
and
flowing
of
the
sea
which
regularly
takes
place
twice
in
hours
the
cause
of
the
tides
is
the
attraction
of
the
sun
but
chiefly
of
the
moon
acting
on
the
waters
of
the
ocean
what
is
gravity
gravity
is
the
attraction
between
the
earth
and
the
bodies
on
the
earth
which
makes
what
we
call
weight
of
bodies
what
do
you
understand
by
specific
weight
or
gravity
it
means
the
weight
of
a
body
as
compared
with
the
weight
of
an
equal
bulk
of
some
other
body
taken
as
a
standard
commonly
water
why
do
we
say
that
certain
metals
as
for
example
platina
or
gold
are
heavier
than
others
say
lead
or
iron
because
the
former
have
a
greater
specific
gravity
but
is
not
a
pound
of
gold
as
heavy
as
a
pound
of
lead
yes
but
a
lump
of
gold
will
be
heavier
than
a
lump
of
lead
of
equal
bulk
can
we
explain
by
this
what
we
call
floating
a
body
will
float
in
water
if
its
gravity
is
less
than
that
of
water
for
example
wood
floats
for
this
reason
in
water
and
a
balloon
in
the
air
why
does
a
portion
of
the
floating
body
sink
below
the
surface
of
the
water
because
the
body
in
order
to
float
must
displace
a
portion
of
water
equal
in
weight
to
the
whole
floating
body
but
why
do
iron
steamers
float
iron
being
heavier
than
water
because
the
steamer
is
not
a
solid
piece
of
iron
but
is
hollow
and
so
increased
in
bulk
for
that
reason
the
weight
of
the
vessel
and
its
contents
is
less
than
that
of
an
equal
bulk
of
water
how
can
you
ascertain
that
air
has
weight
we
can
do
it
by
the
barometer
and
by
very
many
experiences
in
daily
life
if
one
end
of
a
straw
be
dipped
into
a
vessel
of
water
and
the
other
end
be
sucked
the
liquid
will
rise
to
the
mouth
there
we
see
the
pressure
of
the
outside
air
forces
the
liquid
through
the
straw
where
the
air
was
removed
by
sucking
can
you
show
the
same
by
another
instrument
yes
the
common
water
pump
demonstrates
the
same
as
the
straw
a
tube
is
placed
into
the
water
the
air
is
sucked
out
from
the
tube
by
the
movement
of
the
pump
and
the
outside
air
presses
the
water
through
the
tube
what
are
artesian
wells
wells
so
named
because
they
were
made
first
at
artois
in
france
they
work
on
the
principle
that
every
liquid
seeks
its
level
of
the
rain
which
falls
a
part
soaks
into
the
soil
of
mountains
until
coming
to
a
layer
of
rocks
or
clay
through
which
it
can
not
pass
it
will
collect
and
be
stored
up
if
a
hole
be
bored
into
this
reservoir
the
water
will
rise
in
it
do
you
know
some
other
properties
of
air
it
is
the
most
necessary
substance
for
our
life
it
is
the
vehicle
of
all
odors
and
smells
it
is
the
medium
of
all
sounds
and
brings
to
our
ear
and
so
to
our
mind
an
immense
knowledge
of
the
outside
world
it
is
the
cause
of
the
beauty
of
the
blue
firmament
or

it
is
the
great
nurse
of
the
whole

what
is
an
aneroid
barometer
it
is
a
barometer
in
the
construction
of
which
no
quicksilver
or
other
liquid
is
used
it
consists
of
a
metal
box
exhausted
of
air
the
top
of
which
is
of
thin
metal
so
elastic
that
it
readily
yields
to
alterations
in
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
when
the
pressure
increases
the
top
is
pressed
inwards
when
on
the
contrary
it
decreases
the
elasticity
of
the
lid
aided
by
a
spring
tends
to
move
it
in
the
opposite
direction
these
motions
are
transmitted
by
delicate
levers
to
an
index
which
moves
on
a
scale
this
barometer
has
the
advantage
of
being
portable
what
is
the
a
instrument
used
to
aid
deaf
persons
in

its
form
is
conical
and
the
larger

talks
in
the
large
end
it
acts
by
concentrating
the

the
top
edge
of
this
fan
rests
upon
the
upper
teeth
and
the
sound

strike
its
surface
the
vibrations
are
thus
conveyed
by
the
teeth
and
the
bones
of
the
face
to
the
acoustic
nerve
in
the

describe
the
telephone
it
is
an
instrument
by
which
conversation
may
be
carried

steeped
in
the
magnetic
space
round
the
pole
the
metal
disk
is
placed
face
close
to
the
pole
and
bobbin
so
that
when
it
vibrates
in

a
series
of
wave
currents
will
be
set
up
in
the
coil

so
wonderfully
sensitive
is
it
that
the
ticking
of
a

do
you
know
something
about
the
nature
of
light
light
is
a
mere
form
of
vibration
like
sound
and
like
sound
it
requires
some
source
to
set
this
vibration
going
and
some
medium
to
carry
this
vibration
as
air
carries
sound
is
not
the
air
this
medium
no
it
is
supposed
that
there
is
an
elastic
fluid
called
ether
which
pervades
all
space
and
matter
and
if
the
molecules
of
a
body
are
in
motion
they
have
the
power
of
setting
this
ether
in
motion
the
movement
thus
produced
will
appear
either
as
heat
or
light
according
to
its
velocity
what
sources
of
light
do
you
know
we
are
told
that
the
principal
source
of
light
on
earth
is
the
sun
either
directly
with
its
own
beams
or
indirectly
by
supplying
us
with
combustibles
to
produce
light
for
oil
gas
candles
and
most
of
the
substances
used
for
producing
light
and
heat
when
burning
are
but
sending
forth
in
another
form
the
rays
of
the
sun
which
were
stored
up
in
nature
economy
another
source
of
light
is
the
result
of
chemical
action
such
as
the
lime
magnesium
and
electric
light
a
third
source
of
light
is
phosphorescence
as
we
see
it
in
the
and
fireflies
what
is
the
drummond
or
lime
light
it
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
artificial
lights
when
a
stream
of
oxygen
and
one
of
hydrogen
under
pressure
are
brought
together
and
mixed
within
a
few
inches
of
the
end
of
a
blowpipe
the
mixture
on
lighting
burns
with
a
colorless
flame
possessing
intense
heat
if
this
flame
be
made
to
play
upon
a
ball
of
carbonate
of
lime
the
lime
on
becoming
white
hot
gives
off
a
powerful
incandescence
the
glowing
whiteness
of
a
body
caused
by
intense
heat
what
is
a
blowpipe
a
tube
usually
bent
near
the
end
terminated
with
a
nozzle
for
blowing
through
the
flame
of
a
lamp
or
producing
thereby
a
small
conical
flame
possessing
intense
heat
it
is
used
in
soldering
silver
brass
etc
a
mixture
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
when

constitutes
the

invented
by

what
is
magnesium
light
when
the
metal
magnesium
is
rolled
out
into
a
fine
ribbon
and
heated
to
red
heat
it
burns
with
a
dazzling
light
which
is
the
most
powerful
artificial
light
the
electric
light
this
light
whether
produced
by
a
series
of
galvanic
cells
or
by
dynamic
power
is
the
most
brilliant
and
useful
what
is
a
rainbow
the
rainbow
is
that
beautiful
band
or
arc
of
different
colors
in
the
clouds
during
the
occurrence
of
rain
in
sunshine
when
the
clouds
opposite
the
sun
are
very
dark
and
rain
is
falling
from
them
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
divided
by
the
raindrops
as
they
would
be
by
a
prism
there
are
often
two
rainbows
at
the
same
time
because
the
primary
bow
is
again
reflected
to
another
layer
of
clouds
what
is
a
prism
a
triangular
solid
piece
of
glass
on
which
if
a
ray
of
light
be
cast
it
will
be
distinctly
divided
into
the
seven
colors
we
see
in
a
rainbow
by
this
fact
we
see
that
white
light
is
composed
of
different
rays
which
have
different
reflective
susceptibilities
what
is
a
spectrum
it
is
this
beautiful
band
of
seven
colors
obtained
by
the
refraction
of
a
ray
of
light
through
the
prism
whence
come
the
colors
in
the
objects
we
see
in
nature
they
all
come
from
light
every
object
has
a
power
to
absorb
certain
rays
and
to
reflect
others
a
red
cloth
for
example
absorbs
all
the
other
colored
rays
except
red
and
this
it
gives
off
thus
appearing
red
why
are
the
leaves
of
plants
green
because
a
peculiar
chemical
substance
called
chlorophyl
formed
within
their
cells
absorbs
all
other
rays
of
light

into
which
all

what
is
an
electric

electricity
manifests
itself
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
all
may
be
arranged
under
two
heads
as
a
charge
as
a
current
by
means
of
friction
many
bodies
become
electrified
that
is
have
acquired
an
electrical
charge
if
this
charge
is
in
great
quantity
we
call
it
high
tension
when
a
body
containing
an
electrical
charge
is
brought
in
contact
with
other
bodies
through
which
electricity
is
capable
of
passing
there
ensues
a
current
of
electricity
such
bodies
are
called
conductors
what
are
the
sources
of
currents
there
are
currents
produced
by
chemical
action
called
voltaic
currents
by
the

electricity
no
difference
in
electricity
in
itself
when
a
body
has
more
than
its
natural
amount
of
electricity
it
is
said
to
be
charged
positively
when
it
has
less
than
its
natural
amount
it
is
negatively
charged
what
is
a
cell
what
a
battery
if
a
piece
of
zinc
and
copper
joined
by
a
wire
be
dipped
in
a
liquid
generally
weak
sulphuric
acid
which
will
act
chemically
on
the
metals
a
current
is
produced
such
an
arrangement
is
called
a
couple
or
cell
if
many
cells
are
connected
then
it
is
called
a
battery
what
is
if
two
bars
of
any
unlike
metal
for
example
antimony
and
bismuth
be
soldered
together
at
one
end
and
the
other
ends
be
connected
by
a
wire
and
then
the
soldered
end
heated
a
current
will
flow
what
effects
are
produced
by
currents
they
produce
heat
light
decomposition
and
combination
in
liquid
chemical
compounds
they
melt
all
metals
excite
magnetism
and
in
the
animal
body
excite
movements
of
the
muscles
can
you
specify
these
effects
a
strong
battery
produces
heat
in
such
a
degree
that
all
metals
can
be
melted
light
is
produced
in
flashes
or
if
the
end
of
the
leading
wires
are
connected
with
two
pencils
of
hard
carbon
and
brought
very
near
together
then
a
brilliant
light
or
arc
called
the
voltaic
arc
is
produced
this
is
the
dazzling
bright
light
which
we
call
electric
light
the
chemical
effect
of
a
current
in
decomposing
compound
substances
is
called
electrolysis
in
this
way
water
can
be
decomposed
into
its
compounds
hydrogen
and
oxygen
copper
sulphate
into
sulphur
and
metallic
copper
etc
in
this
way
we
can
deposit
strong
adherent
films
of
metal
on
the
surface
of
any
conductor
for
if
the
article
to
be
coated
be
attached
to
the
negative
electrode
of
a
battery
and
dipped
into
a
solution
of
the
metal
with
which
we
desire
to
coat
the
article
say
copper
or
silver
and
the
positive
electrode
be
attached
to
a
plate
of
copper
and
also
dipped
into
a
liquid
when
the
current
passes
the
metal
will
be
decomposed
and
deposited
in
a
uniform
layer
over
the
article
at
the
negative
electrode
this
process
is
called
what
is
electrotyping
it
is
the
process
of
copying
medals
type
engraved
copper
and
steel
plates
by
means
of
electrical
deposition
it
is
chiefly
used
for
making
from
the
ordinary
movable
types
plates
of
fixed
metallic
types
for
printing
books
describe
the
process
the
article
to
be
copied
is
first
covered
with
and
then
a
mould
is
made
of
it
in
wax
or
this
mould
is
placed
in
a
solution
of
sulphate
of
copper
and
attached
to
the
negative
pole
of
the
battery
while
a
plate
of
copper
is
hung
from
the
positive
pole
the
electric
current
decomposes
the
copper
which
is
deposited
in
a
thin
film
upon
the
mould
this
film
is
removed
and
stiffened
by
being
backed
with
metal
what
is
the
difference
between
electrotyping
and
stereotyping
in
stereotyping
a
plaster
of
paris
mould
is
taken
from
the
types
and
upon
this
mould
melted
is
poured
which
when
hardened
makes
a
solid
plate
is
there
any
other
method
of
stereotyping
yes
that
known
as
the
paper
process
a
uniform
sheet
of
soft
matter
is
formed
by
pasting
together
sheets
of
thin
tough
tissue
paper
the
types
are
oiled
and
the
soft
moist
sheet
is
placed
on
them
and
beaten
down
with
a
stiff
brush
until
it
receives
an
impression
of
the
both
are
then
run
through
a
press
and
on
being
taken
out
the
paper
is
found
to
form
a
perfect
mould
into
this
mould
the
is
poured
and
the
plate
formed
can
you
tell
me
some
magnetic
effects
of
the
current
all
conductors
become
magnetic
during
the
passage
of
a
current
through
them
and
thereby
acquire
all
the
properties
of
a
magnet
there
are
bodies
which
are
natural
magnets
and
they
are
called
permanent
magnets
those
which
become
magnets
only
during
the
passage
of
a
current
are
called
do
you
know
any
application
of
those
magnets
they
are
employed
in
a
great
variety
of
electrical
apparatus
principally
in
telegraphy
when
was
the
first
telegraph
established
it
was
made
in
being
invented
by
steinheil
of
munich
and
adopted
by
the
government
of
bavaria
it
was
miles
long
and
the
signals
were
made
by
small
bells
who
was
the
inventor
of
the
telegraph
in
this
country
samuel
morse
who
was
born
at
charlestown
april
he
began
life
as
a
painter
but
did
not
give
his
whole
attention
to
art
chemistry
and
experiments
in
electricity
and
galvanism
claiming
much
of
his
time
he
first
conceived
the
idea
of
the
telegraph
in
and
exhibited
his
invention
to
congress
in
he
struggled
on
with
scanty
means
and
was
about
to
give
up
in
despair
when
congress
appropriated
for
an
experimental
line
which
was
opened
on
may
between
washington
and
baltimore
morse
died
in
but
not
before
he
had
reaped
honors
and
fortune
from
his
invention
how
rapidly
does
the
electric
current
travel
through
the
wires
from
experiments
made
it
appears
to
be
about
miles
in
a
second
can
more
than
one
message
be
sent
at
the

what
was
the
greatest
telegraphic
undertaking
that
of
connecting
europe
with
america
by
a
submarine
cable
spanning
the
ocean
which
was
commenced
in

completed
august
to
whom
do
we
owe
this
grand
undertaking
this
honor
is
entirely
due
to
cyrus
field
field
was
born
at
stockbridge
on
november
in
he
became
interested
in
ocean
telegraphy
and
after
many
reverses
succeeded
in
laying
the
first
cable
in
august
the
message
sent
by
queen
victoria
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
consisting
of
words
occupied
minutes
in
transmitting
in
september
of
the
same
year
this
cable
ceased
to
work
but
the
energy
of
field
restored
confidence
and
another
cable
was
made
and
laid
down
in
july
but
after
miles
were
deposited
it
was
lost
in
another
was
made
and
successfully
laid
in
july
in
august
the
lost
cable
was
found
and
spliced
and
carried
to

various
opinions
have
been
expressed
as
to
this
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
amount

and
began
work
in
though
beset
by
many
difficulties
the
persistent
energy
of
de
lesseps
fought
its
way
to
success
and
in
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
waters
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
red

mingle
in
the
bitter
lakes
he
has
since
been
engaged
