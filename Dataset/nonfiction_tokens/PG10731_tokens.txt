translator
preface
the
volume
now
before
the
reader
is
a
tardy
addition
to
a
series
in
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
present
schopenhauer
minor
writings
in
an
adequate
form
its
contents
are
drawn
entirely
from
his
posthumous
papers
a
selection
of
them
was
given
to
the
world
some
three
of
four
years
after
his
death
by
his
friend
and
literary
executor
julius
frauenst√§dt
who
for
this
and
other
offices
of
piety
has
received
less
recognition
than
he
deserves
the
papers
then
published
have
recently
been
issued
afresh
with
considerable
additions
and
corrections
by
eduard
grisebach
who
is
also
entitled
to
gratitude
for
the
care
with
which
he
has
followed
the
text
of
the
manuscripts
now
in
the
royal
library
at
berlin
and
for
having
drawn
attention
although
in
terms
that
are
unnecessarily
severe
to
a
number
of
faults
and
failings
on
the
part
of
the
previous
editor
the
fact
that
all
schopenhauer
works
together
with
a
volume
of
his
correspondence
may
now
be
obtained
in
a
certain
cheap
collection
of
the
best
national
and
foreign
literature
displayed
in
almost
every
bookshop
in
germany
is
sufficient
evidence
that
in
his
own
country
the
writer
popularity
is
still
very
great
nor
does
the
demand
for
translations
indicate
that
his
fame
has
at
all
diminished
abroad
the
favour
with
which
the
new
edition
of
his
posthumous
papers
has
been
received
induces
me
therefore
to
resume
a
task
which
i
thought
five
years
ago
that
i
had
finally
completed
and
it
is
my
intention
to
bring
out
one
more
volume
selected
partly
from
these
papers
and
partly
from
his
a
small
part
of
the
essay
on
art
of
was
published
in
schopenhauer
lifetime
in
the
chapter
of
the
headed
logik
und
the
intelligent
reader
will
discover
that
a
good
deal
of
its
contents
is
of
an
ironical
character
as
regards
the
last
three
essays
i
must
observe
that
i
have
omitted
such
passages
as
appear
to
be
no
longer
of
any
general
interest
or
otherwise
unsuitable
i
must
also
confess
to
having
taken
one
or
two
liberties
with
the
titles
in
order
that
they
may
the
more
effectively
fulfil
the
purpose
for
which
titles
exist
in
other
respects
i
have
adhered
to
the
original
with
the
kind
of
fidelity
which
aims
at
producing
an
impression
as
nearly
as
possible
similar
to
that
produced
by
the
original
february
the
art
of
controversy
preliminary
logic
and
dialectic
by
the
ancients
logic
and
dialectic
were
used
as
synonymous
terms
although
greek
logizesthai
to
think
over
to
consider
to
calculate
and
greek
dialegesthai
to
converse
are
two
very
different
things
the
name
dialectic
was
as
we
are
informed
by
diogenes
laertius
first
used
by
plato
and
in
the
sophist
bk
and
elsewhere
we
find
that
by
dialectic
he
means
the
regular
employment
of
the
reason
and
skill
in
the
practice
of
it
aristotle
also
uses
the
word
in
this
sense
but
according
to
laurentius
valla
he
was
the
first
to
use
logic
too
in
a
similar
way
dialectic
therefore
seems
to
be
an
older
word
than
logic
cicero
and
quintilian
use
the
words
in
the
same
general
signification

he
speaks
of

and
with
him
this
latter
word
appears
to
be
the
latin
equivalent
for
dialectic
so
far
according
to
petri
rami
dialectica
audomari
talaei
praelectionibus
illustrata
this
use
of
the
words
and
synonymous
terms
lasted
through
the
middle
ages
into
modern
times
in
fact
until
the
present
day
but
more
recently
and
in
particular
by
kant
dialectic
has
often
been
employed
in
a
bad
sense
as
meaning
the
art
of
sophistical
controversy
and
hence
logic
has
been
preferred
as
of
the
two
the
more
innocent
designation
nevertheless
both
originally
meant
the
same
thing
and
in
the
last
few
years
they
have
again
been
recognised
as
synonymous
it
is
a
pity
that
the
words
have
thus
been
used
from
of
old
and
that
i
am
not
quite
at
liberty
to
distinguish
their
meanings
otherwise
i
should
have
preferred
to
define
from
greek
logos
word
and
reason
which
are
inseparable
as
the
science
of
the
laws
of
thought
that
is
of
the
method
of
reason
and
from
greek
dialegesthai
to
converse
and
every
conversation
communicates
either
facts
or
opinions
that
is
to
say
it
is
historical
or
deliberative
as
the
art
of
disputation
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
it
it
clear
then
that
logic
deals
with
a
subject
of
a
purely
character
separable
in
definition
from
experience
namely
the
laws
of
thought
the
process
of
reason
or
the
greek
logos
the
laws
that
is
which
reason
follows
when
it
is
left
to
itself
and
not
hindered
as
in
the
case
of
solitary
thought
on
the
part
of
a
rational
being
who
is
in
no
way
misled
dialectic
on
the
other
hand
would
treat
of
the
intercourse
between
two
rational
beings
who
because
they
are
rational
ought
to
think
in
common
but
who
as
soon
as
they
cease
to
agree
like
two
clocks
keeping
exactly
the
same
time
create
a
disputation
or
intellectual
contest
regarded
as
purely
rational
beings
the
individuals
would
i
say
necessarily
be
in
agreement
and
their
variation
springs
from
the
difference
essential
to
individuality
in
other
words
it
is
drawn
from
experience
logic
therefore
as
the
science
of
thought
or
the
science
of
the
process
of
pure
reason
should
be
capable
of
being
constructed
dialectic
for
the
most
part
can
be
constructed
only
that
is
to
say
we
may
learn
its
rules
by
an
experiential
knowledge
of
the
disturbance
which
pure
thought
suffers
through
the
difference
of
individuality
manifested
in
the
intercourse
between
two
rational
beings
and
also
by
acquaintance
with
the
means
which
disputants
adopt
in
order
to
make
good
against
one
another
their
own
individual
thought
and
to
show
that
it
is
pure
and
objective
for
human
nature
is
such
that
if
and
are
engaged
in
thinking
in
common
and
are
communicating
their
opinions
to
one
another
on
any
subject
so
long
as
it
is
not
a
mere
fact
of
history
and
perceives
that
b
thoughts
on
one
and
the
same
subject
are
not
the
same
as
his
own
he
does
not
begin
by
revising
his
own
process
of
thinking
so
as
to
discover
any
mistake
which
he
may
have
made
but
he
assumes
that
the
mistake
has
occurred
in
in
other
words
man
is
naturally
obstinate
and
this
quality
in
him
is
attended
with
certain
results
treated
of
in
the
branch
of
knowledge
which
i
should
like
to
call
dialectic
but
which
in
order
to
avoid
misunderstanding
i
shall
call
controversial
or
eristical
dialectic
accordingly
it
is
the
branch
of
knowledge
which
treats
of
the
obstinacy
natural
to
man
eristic
is
only
a
harsher
name
for
the
same
thing
controversial
dialectic
is
the
art
of
disputing
and
of
disputing
in
such
a
way
as
to
hold
one
own
whether
one
is
in
the
right
or
the
wrong
fas
et
a
man
may
be
objectively
in
the
right
and
nevertheless
in
the
eyes
of
bystanders
and
sometimes
in
his
own
he
may
come
off
worst
for
example
i
may
advance
a
proof
of
some
assertion
and
my
adversary
may
refute
the
proof
and
thus
appear
to
have
refuted
the
assertion
for
which
there
may
nevertheless
be
other
proofs
in
this
case
of
course
my
adversary
and
i
change
places
he
comes
off
best
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
in
the
wrong
footnote
according
to
diogenes
laertius
aristotle
put
rhetoric
and
dialectic
together
as
aiming
at
persuasion
greek
to
pithanon
and
analytic
and
philosophy
as
aiming
at
truth
aristotle
does
indeed
distinguish
between
or
analytic
as
the
theory
or
method
of
arriving
at
true
or
apodeictic
conclusions
and
as
the
method
of
arriving
at
conclusions
that
are
accepted
or
pass
current
as
true
greek
endoxa
conclusions
in
regard
to
which
it
is
not
taken
for
granted
that
they
are
false
and
also
not
taken
for
granted
that
they
are
true
in
themselves
since
that
is
not
the
point
what
is
this
but
the
art
of
being
in
the
right
whether
one
has
any
reason
for
being
so
or
not
in
other
words
the
art
of
attaining
the
appearance
of
truth
regardless
of
its
substance
that
is
then
as
i
put
it
above
aristotle
divides
all
conclusions
into
logical
and
dialectical
in
the
manner
described
and
then
into
eristical
is
the
method
by
which
the
form
of
the
conclusion
is
correct
but
the
premisses
the
materials
from
which
it
is
drawn
are
not
true
but
only
appear
to
be
true
finally
is
the
method
in
which
the
form
of
the
conclusion
is
false
although
it
seems
correct
these
three
last
properly
belong
to
the
art
of
controversial
dialectic
as
they
have
no
objective
truth
in
view
but
only
the
appearance
of
it
and
pay
no
regard
to
truth
itself
that
is
to
say
they
aim
at
victory
aristotle
book
on
was
edited
apart
from
the
others
and
at
a
later
date
it
was
the
last
book
of
his
if
the
reader
asks
how
this
is
i
reply
that
it
is
simply
the
natural
baseness
of
human
nature
if
human
nature
were
not
base
but
thoroughly
honourable
we
should
in
every
debate
have
no
other
aim
than
the
discovery
of
truth
we
should
not
in
the
least
care
whether
the
truth
proved
to
be
in
favour
of
the
opinion
which
we
had
begun
by
expressing
or
of
the
opinion
of
our
adversary
that
we
should
regard
as
a
matter
of
no
moment
or
at
any
rate
of
very
secondary
consequence
but
as
things
are
it
is
the
main
concern
our
innate
vanity
which
is
particularly
sensitive
in
reference
to
our
intellectual
powers
will
not
suffer
us
to
allow
that
our
first
position
was
wrong
and
our
adversary
right
the
way
out
of
this
difficulty
would
be
simply
to
take
the
trouble
always
to
form
a
correct
judgment
for
this
a
man
would
have
to
think
before
he
spoke
but
with
most
men
innate
vanity
is
accompanied
by
loquacity
and
innate
dishonesty
they
speak
before
they
think
and
even
though
they
may
afterwards
perceive
that
they
are
wrong
and
that
what
they
assert
is
false
they
want
it
to
seem
the
contrary
the
interest
in
truth
which
may
be
presumed
to
have
been
their
only
motive
when
they
stated
the
proposition
alleged
to
be
true
now
gives
way
to
the
interests
of
vanity
and
so
for
the
sake
of
vanity
what
is
true
must
seem
false
and
what
is
false
must
seem
true
however
this
very
dishonesty
this
persistence
in
a
proposition
which
seems
false
even
to
ourselves
has
something
to
be
said
for
it
it
often
happens
that
we
begin
with
the
firm
conviction
of
the
truth
of
our
statement
but
our
opponent
argument
appears
to
refute
it
should
we
abandon
our
position
at
once
we
may
discover
later
on
that
we
were
right
after
all
the
proof
we
offered
was
false
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
proof
for
our
statement
which
was
true
the
argument
which
would
have
been
our
salvation
did
not
occur
to
us
at
the
moment
hence
we
make
it
a
rule
to
attack
a
even
though
to
all
appearances
it
is
true
and
forcible
in
the
belief
that
its
truth
is
only
superficial
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
another
argument
will
occur
to
us
by
which
we
may
upset
it
or
succeed
in
confirming
the
truth
of
our
statement
in
this
way
we
are
almost
compelled
to
become
dishonest
or
at
any
rate
the
temptation
to
do
so
is
very
great
thus
it
is
that
the
weakness
of
our
intellect
and
the
perversity
of
our
will
lend
each
other
mutual
support
and
that
generally
a
disputant
fights
not
for
truth
but
for
his
proposition
as
though
it
were
a
battle
aris
et
he
sets
to
work
fas
et
nay
as
we
have
seen
he
can
not
easily
do
otherwise
as
a
rule
then
every
man
will
insist
on
maintaining
whatever
he
has
said
even
though
for
the
moment
he
may
consider
it
false
or
doubtful
footnote
machiavelli
recommends
his
prince
to
make
use
of
every
moment
that
his
neighbour
is
weak
in
order
to
attack
him
as
otherwise
his
neighbour
may
do
the
same
if
honour
and
fidelity
prevailed
in
the
world
it
would
be
a
different
matter
but
as
these
are
qualities
not
to
be
expected
a
man
must
not
practise
them
himself
because
he
will
meet
with
a
bad
return
it
is
just
the
same
in
a
dispute
if
i
allow
that
my
opponent
is
right
as
soon
as
he
seems
to
be
so
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
he
will
do
the
same
when
the
position
is
reversed
and
as
he
acts
wrongly
i
am
compelled
to
act
wrongly
too
it
is
easy
to
say
that
we
must
yield
to
truth
without
any
prepossession
in
favour
of
our
own
statements
but
we
can
not
assume
that
our
opponent
will
do
it
and
therefore
we
can
not
do
it
either
nay
if
i
were
to
abandon
the
position
on
which
i
had
previously
bestowed
much
thought
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
he
was
right
it
might
easily
happen
that
i
might
be
misled
by
a
momentary
impression
and
give
up
the
truth
in
order
to
accept
an
error
to
some
extent
every
man
is
armed
against
such
a
procedure
by
his
own
cunning
and
villainy
he
learns
by
daily
experience
and
thus
comes
to
have
his
own
just
as
he
has
his
own
but
his
dialectic
is
by
no
means
as
safe
a
guide
as
his
logic
it
is
not
so
easy
for
any
one
to
think
or
draw
an
inference
contrary
to
the
laws
of
logic
false
judgments
are
frequent
false
conclusions
very
rare
a
man
can
not
easily
be
deficient
in
natural
logic
but
he
may
very
easily
be
deficient
in
natural
dialectic
which
is
a
gift
apportioned
in
unequal
measure
in
so
far
natural
dialectic
resembles
the
faculty
of
judgment
which
differs
in
degree
with
every
man
while
reason
strictly
speaking
is
the
same
for
it
often
happens
that
in
a
matter
in
which
a
man
is
really
in
the
right
he
is
confounded
or
refuted
by
merely
superficial
arguments
and
if
he
emerges
victorious
from
a
contest
he
owes
it
very
often
not
so
much
to
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
in
stating
his
proposition
as
to
the
cunning
and
address
with
which
he
defended
it
here
as
in
all
other
cases
the
best
gifts
are
born
with
a
man
nevertheless
much
may
be
done
to
make
him
a
master
of
this
art
by
practice
and
also
by
a
consideration
of
the
tactics
which
may
be
used
to
defeat
an
opponent
or
which
he
uses
himself
for
a
similar
purpose
therefore
even
though
logic
may
be
of
no
very
real
practical
use
dialectic
may
certainly
be
so
and
aristotle
too
seems
to
me
to
have
drawn
up
his
logic
proper
or
analytic
as
a
foundation
and
preparation
for
his
dialectic
and
to
have
made
this
his
chief
business
logic
is
concerned
with
the
mere
form
of
propositions
dialectic
with
their
contents
or
matter
in
a
word
with
their
substance
it
was
proper
therefore
to
consider
the
general
form
of
all
propositions
before
proceeding
to
particulars
aristotle
does
not
define
the
object
of
dialectic
as
exactly
as
i
have
done
it
here
for
while
he
allows
that
its
principal
object
is
disputation
he
declares
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
also
the
discovery
of
truth
again
he
says
later
on
that
if
from
the
philosophical
point
of
view
propositions
are
dealt
with
according
to
their
truth
dialectic
regards
them
according
to
their
plausibility
or
the
measure
in
which
they
will
win
the
approval
and
assent
of
others
he
is
aware
that
the
objective
truth
of
a
proposition
must
be
distinguished
and
separated
from
the
way
in
which
it
is
pressed
home
and
approbation
won
for
it
but
he
fails
to
draw
a
sufficiently
sharp
distinction
between
these
two
aspects
of
the
matter
so
as
to
reserve
dialectic
for
the
latter
alone
the
rules
which
he
often
gives
for
dialectic
contain
some
of
those
which
properly
belong
to
logic
and
hence
it
appears
to
me
that
he
has
not
provided
a
clear
solution
of
the
problem
footnote

footnote
footnote
on
the
other
hand
in
his
book
sophisticis
he
takes
too
much
trouble
to
separate
from
and
where
the
distinction
is
said
to
consist
in
this
that
dialectical
conclusions
are
true
in
their
form
and
their
contents
while
sophistical
and
eristical
conclusions
are
false
eristic
so
far
differs
from
sophistic
that
while
the
master
of
eristic
aims
at
mere
victory
the
sophist
looks
to
the
reputation
and
with
it
the
monetary
rewards
which
he
will
gain
but
whether
a
proposition
is
true
in
respect
of
its
contents
is
far
too
uncertain
a
matter
to
form
the
foundation
of
the
distinction
in
question
and
it
is
a
matter
on
which
the
disputant
least
of
all
can
arrive
at
certainty
nor
is
it
disclosed
in
any
very
sure
form
even
by
the
result
of
the
disputation
therefore
when
aristotle
speaks
of
we
must
include
in
it
sophistic
eristic
and
peirastic
and
define
it
as
the
art
of
getting
the
best
of
it
in
a
dispute
in
which
unquestionably
the
safest
plan
is
to
be
in
the
right
to
begin
with
but
this
in
itself
is
not
enough
in
the
existing
disposition
of
mankind
and
on
the
other
hand
with
the
weakness
of
the
human
intellect
it
is
not
altogether
necessary
other
expedients
are
required
which
just
because
they
are
unnecessary
to
the
attainment
of
objective
truth
may
also
be
used
when
a
man
is
objectively
in
the
wrong
and
whether
or
not
this
is
the
case
is
hardly
ever
a
matter
of
complete
certainty
i
am
of
opinion
therefore
that
a
sharper
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
dialectic
and
logic
than
aristotle
has
given
us
that
to
logic
we
should
assign
objective
truth
as
far
as
it
is
merely
formal
and
that
dialectic
should
be
confined
to
the
art
of
gaining
one
point
and
contrarily
that
sophistic
and
eristic
should
not
be
distinguished
from
dialectic
in
aristotle
fashion
since
the
difference
which
he
draws
rests
on
objective
and
material
truth
and
in
regard
to
what
this
is
we
can
not
attain
any
clear
certainty
before
discussion
but
we
are
compelled
with
pilate
to
ask
is
for
truth

in
the
depths

in

and
then
return
to
their

each
of
the

which
he
has
exchanged
for
his
own
it
is
easy
to
say
that
in
every
dispute
we
should
have
no
other
aim
than
the
advancement
of
truth
but
before
dispute
no
one
knows
where
it
is
and
through
his
arguments
and
his
own
a
man
is
misled
we
must
always
keep
the
subject
of
one
branch
of
knowledge
quite
distinct
from
that
of
any
other
to
form
a
clear
idea
of
the
province
of
dialectic
we
must
pay
no
attention
to
objective
truth
which
is
an
affair
of
logic
we
must
regard
it
simply
as
art
of
getting
the
best
of
it
in
a
which
as
we
have
seen
is
all
the
easier
if
we
are
actually
in
the
right
in
itself
dialectic
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
show
how
a
man
may
defend
himself
against
attacks
of
every
kind
and
especially
against
dishonest
attacks
and
in
the
same
fashion
how
he
may
attack
another
man
statement
without
contradicting
himself
or
generally
without
being
defeated
the
discovery
of
objective
truth
must
be
separated
from
the
art
of
winning
acceptance
for
propositions
for
objective
truth
is
an
entirely
different
matter
it
is
the
business
of
sound
judgment
reflection
and
experience
for
which
there
is
no
special
art
such
then
is
the
aim
of
dialectic
it
has
been
defined
as
the
logic
of
appearance
but
the
definition
is
a
wrong
one
as
in
that
case
it
could
only
be
used
to
repel
false
propositions
but
even
when
a
man
has
the
right
on
his
side
he
needs
dialectic
in
order
to
defend
and
maintain
it
he
must
know
what
the
dishonest
tricks
are
in
order
to
meet
them
nay
he
must
often
make
use
of
them
himself
so
as
to
beat
the
enemy
with
his
own
weapons
accordingly
in
a
dialectical
contest
we
must
put
objective
truth
aside
or
rather
we
must
regard
it
as
an
accidental
circumstance
and
look
only
to
the
defence
of
our
own
position
and
the
refutation
of
our
opponent
in
following
out
the
rules
to
this
end
no
respect
should
be
paid
to
objective
truth
because
we
usually
do
not
know
where
the
truth
lies
as
i
have
said
a
man
often
does
not
himself
know
whether
he
is
in
the
right
or
not
he
often
believes
it
and
is
mistaken
both
sides
often
believe
it
truth
is
in
the
depths
at
the
beginning
of
a
contest
each
man
believes
as
a
rule
that
right
is
on
his
side
in
the
course
of
it
both
become
doubtful
and
the
truth
is
not
determined
or
confirmed
until
the
close
dialectic
then
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
truth
as
little
as
the
fencing
master
considers
who
is
in
the
right
when
a
dispute
leads
to
a
duel
thrust
and
parry
is
the
whole
business
dialectic
is
the
art
of
intellectual
fencing
and
it
is
only
when
we
so
regard
it
that
we
can
erect
it
into
a
branch
of
knowledge
for
if
we
take
purely
objective
truth
as
our
aim
we
are
reduced
to
mere
logic
if
we
take
the
maintenance
of
false
propositions
it
is
mere
sophistic
and
in
either
case
it
would
have
to
be
assumed
that
we
were
aware
of
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
and
it
is
seldom
that
we
have
any
clear
idea
of
the
truth
beforehand
the
true
conception
of
dialectic
is
then
that
which
we
have
formed
it
is
the
art
of
intellectual
fencing
used
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
best
of
it
in
a
dispute
and
although
the
name
would
be
more
suitable
it
is
more
correct
to
call
it
controversial
dialectic
dialectic
in
this
sense
of
the
word
has
no
other
aim
but
to
reduce
to
a
regular
system
and
collect
and
exhibit
the
arts
which
most
men
employ
when
they
observe
in
a
dispute
that
truth
is
not
on
their
side
and
still
attempt
to
gain
the
day
hence
it
would
be
very
inexpedient
to
pay
any
regard
to
objective
truth
or
its
advancement
in
a
science
of
dialectic
since
this
is
not
done
in
that
original
and
natural
dialectic
innate
in
men
where
they
strive
for
nothing
but
victory
the
science
of
dialectic
in
one
sense
of
the
word
is
mainly
concerned
to
tabulate
and
analyse
dishonest
stratagems
in
order
that
in
a
real
debate
they
may
be
at
once
recognised
and
defeated
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
dialectic
must
admittedly
take
victory
and
not
objective
truth
for
its
aim
and
purpose
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
has
been
done
in
this
direction
although
i
have
made
inquiries
far
and
wide
it
is
therefore
an
uncultivated
soil
to
accomplish
our
purpose
we
must
draw
from
our
experience
we
must
observe
how
in
the
debates
which
often
arise
in
our
intercourse
with
our
this
or
that
stratagem
is
employed
by
one
side
or
the
other
by
finding
out
the
common
elements
in
tricks
repeated
in
different
forms
we
shall
be
enabled
to
exhibit
certain
general
stratagems
which
may
be
advantageous
as
well
for
our

for

our

and
two

that
we
may
pursue
i
the
modes
are

is
to

that

that
it
is
inconsistent
with

of
our

with
truth

it
appears
to
him
the
latter
mode
of
arguing
a
question
produces
only
a
relative
conviction
and
makes
no
difference
whatever
to
the
objective

admits
of
a
twofold

may
show

for

statement
are
false

we
may
admit
the
reasons

follow
from

is
we

the
conclusion

either
of
the
or
of
the
a

accept
our

proposition
as
true
and
then
show
what
follows
from
it
when
we
bring
it
into
connection
with
some
other
proposition
acknowledged
to
be
true
we
use
the
two
propositions
as
the
premisses
of
a
syllogism
giving
a
conclusion
which
is
manifestly
false
as
contradicting
either
the
nature
of
things
or
other
statements
of
our
opponent
himself
that
is
to
say
the
conclusion
is
false

our

proposition
must
have
been
false

the
or

example
to
the
this
consists
in
refuting
the
general
proposition
by
direct
reference
to
particular
cases
which
are
included
in

in
the
way
in
which
it
is
stated
but
to
which
it
does
not

and
by
which
it
is

shown
to

and
it

arguments
it
is
just
because
it
is
not
easy
to
make
out
the
truth
in
regard
to
this
matter
that
debates
are
so
long
and
so
obstinate
nor
can
we
in
ordering
the
argument
separate
actual
from
apparent
truth

even

disputants
are
not
certain
about
it
beforehand
therefore
i
shall
describe
the
various
tricks
or
stratagems
without
regard
to
questions
of
objective
truth
or
falsity
for
that
is
a
matter
on
which
we
have
no
assurance
and
which
can
not
be
determined
previously
moreover
in
every
disputation
or
argument
on
any
subject
we
must
agree
about
something
and

stratagems
i
the
this
consists
in
carrying
your
proposition
beyond
its
natural
limits
in
giving
it
as
general
a
signification
and
as
wide
a
sense
as
possible
so
as
to
exaggerate
it
and
on
the
other
hand
in
giving
your
own
proposition
as
restricted
a
sense
and
as
narrow
limits
as
you
can
because
the
more
general
a
statement
becomes
the
more
numerous
are
the
objections
to
which
it
is
open
the
defence
consists
in
an
accurate
statement
of
the
point
or
essential
question
at
issue
example
i
asserted
that
the
english
were
supreme
in
drama
my
opponent
attempted
give
an
instance
to
the
contrary
and
replied
that
it
was
a
fact
that
in
music
and
consequently
in
opera
they
could
do
nothing
at
all
i
repelled
the
attack
by
reminding
him
that
music
was
not
included
in
dramatic
art
which
covered
tragedy
and
comedy
alone
this
he
knew
very
well
what
he
had
done
was
to
try
to
generalise
my
proposition
so
that
it
would
apply
to
all
theatrical
representations
and
consequently
to
opera
and
then
to
music
in
order
to
make
certain
of
defeating
me
contrarily
we
may
save
our
proposition
by
reducing
it
within
narrower
limits
than
we
had
first
intended
if
our
way
of
expressing
it
favours
this
expedient
example
a
declares
that
the
peace
of
gave
back
their
independence
to
all
the
german
towns
of
the
hanseatic
league
gives
an
instance
to
the
contrary
by
reciting
the
fact
that
dantzig
which
received
its
independence
from
buonaparte
lost
it
by
that
peace
saves
himself
thus
i
said
german
towns
and
dantzig
was
in
poland
this
trick
was
mentioned
by
aristotle
in
the
bk
cc
example
lamarck
in
his
vol
states
that
the
polype
has
no
feeling
because
it
has
no
nerves
it
is
certain
however
that
it
has
some
sort
of
perception
for
it
advances
towards
light
by
moving
in
an
ingenious
fashion
from
branch
to
branch
and
it
seizes
its
prey
hence
it
has
been
assumed
that
its
nervous
system
is
spread
over
the
whole
of
its
body
in
equal
measure
as
though
it
were
blended
with
it
for
it
is
obvious
that
the
polype
possesses
some
faculty
of
perception
without
having
any
separate
organs
of
sense
since
this
assumption
refutes
lamarck
position
he
argues
thus
in
that
case
all
parts
of
its
body
must
be
capable
of
every
kind
of
feeling
and
also
of
motion
of
will
of
thought
the
polype
would
have
all
the
organs
of
the
most
perfect
animal
in
every
point
of
its
body
every
point
could
see
smell
taste
hear
and
so
on
nay
it
could
think
judge
and
draw
conclusions
every
particle
of
its
body
would
be
a
perfect
animal
and
it
would
stand
higher
than
man
as
every
part
of
it
would
possess
all
the
faculties
which
man
possesses
only
in
the
whole
of
him
further
there
would
be
no
reason
for
not
extending
what
is
true
of
the
polype
to
all
monads
the
most
imperfect
of
all
creatures
and
ultimately
to
the
plants
which
are
also
alive
etc
by
using
dialectical
tricks
of
this
kind
a
writer
betrays
that
he
is
secretly
conscious
of
being
in
the
wrong
because
it
was
said
that
the
creature
whole
body
is
sensitive
to
light
and
is
therefore
possessed
of
nerves
he
makes
out
that
its
whole
body
is
capable
of
thought
ii
the
this
trick
is
to
extend
a
proposition
to
something
which
has
little
or
nothing
in
common
with
the
matter
in
question
but
the
similarity
of
the
word
then
to
refute
it
triumphantly
and
so
claim
credit
for
having
refuted
the
original
statement
it
may
be
noted
here
that
synonyms
are
two
words
for
the
same
conception
homonyms
two
conceptions
which
are
covered
by
the
same
word
see
aristotle
bk
c
deep
cutting
high
used
at
one
moment
of
bodies
at
another
of
tones
are
homonyms
honourable
and
honest
are
synonyms
this
is
a
trick
which
may
be
regarded
as
identical
with
the
sophism
although
if
the
sophism
is
obvious
it
will
deceive
no
one
light
can
be
extinguished
the
intellect
is
a
light
therefore
it
can
be
here
it
is
at
once
clear
that
there
are
four
terms
in
the
syllogism
light
being
used
both
in
a
real
and
in
a
metaphorical
sense
but
if
the
sophism
takes
a
subtle
form
it
is
of
course
apt
to
mislead
especially
where
the
conceptions
which
are
covered
by
the
same
word
are
related
and
inclined
to
be
interchangeable
it
is
never
subtle
enough
to
deceive
if
it
is
used
intentionally
and
therefore
cases
of
it
must
be
collected
from
actual
and
individual
experience
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
every
trick
could
receive
some
short
and
obviously
appropriate
name
so
that
when
a
man
used
this
or
that
particular
trick
he
could
be
at
once
reproached
for
it
i
will
give
two
examples
of
the
homonymy
example
a
you
are
not
yet
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
kantian
philosophy
oh
if
it
mysteries
you
talking
of
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
example
i
condemned
the
principle
involved
in
the
word
as
a
foolish
one
for
according
to
it
a
man
loses
his
honour
by
receiving
an
insult
which
he
can
not
wipe
out
unless
he
replies
with
a
still
greater
insult
or
by
shedding
his
adversary
blood
or
his
own
i
contended
that
a
man
true
honour
can
not
be
outraged
by
what
he
suffers
but
only
and
alone
by
what
he
does
for
there
is
no
saying
what
may
befall
any
one
of
us
my
opponent
immediately
attacked
the
reason
i
had
given
and
triumphantly
proved
to
me
that
when
a
tradesman
was
falsely
accused
of
misrepresentation
dishonesty
or
neglect
in
his
business
it
was
an
attack
upon
his
honour
which
in
this
case
was
outraged
solely
by
what
he
suffered
and
that
he
could
only
retrieve
it
by
punishing
his
aggressor
and
making
him
retract
here
by
a
homonymy
he
was
foisting
which
is
otherwise
called
and
which
may
be
outraged
by
libel
and
slander
on
to
the
conception
of
also
called
which
may
be
outraged
by
insult
and
since
an
attack
on
the
former
can
not
be
disregarded
but
must
be
repelled
by
public
disproof
so
with
the
same
justification
an
attack
on
the
latter
must
not
be
disregarded
either
but
it
must
be
defeated
by
still
greater
insult
and
a
duel
here
we
have
a
confusion
of
two
essentially
different
things
through
the
homonymy
in
the
word
and
a
consequent
alteration
of
the
point
in
dispute
iii
another
trick
is
to
take
a
proposition
which
is
laid
down
relatively
and
in
reference
to
some
particular
matter
as
though
it
were
uttered
with
a
general
or
absolute
application
or
at
least
to
take
it
in
some
quite
different
sense
and
then
refute
it
aristotle
example
is
as
follows
a
moor
is
black
but
in
regard
to
his
teeth
he
is
white
therefore
he
is
black
and
not
black
at
the
same
moment
this
is
an
obvious
sophism
which
will
deceive
no
one
let
us
contrast
it
with
one
drawn
from
actual
experience
in
talking
of
philosophy
i
admitted
that
my
system
upheld
the
quietists
and
commended
them
shortly
afterwards
the
conversation
turned
upon
hegel
and
i
maintained
that
his
writings
were
mostly
nonsense
or
at
any
rate
that
there
were
many
passages
in
them
where
the
author
wrote
the
words
and
it
was
left
to
the
reader
to
find
a
meaning
for
them
my
opponent
did
not
attempt
to
refute
this
assertion
but
contented
himself
by
advancing
the
ad
and
telling
me
that
i
had
just
been
praising
the
quietists
and
that
they
had
written
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
too
this
i
admitted
but
by
way
of
correcting
him
i
said
that
i
had
praised
the
quietists
not
as
philosophers
and
writers
that
is
to
say
for
their
achievements
in
the
sphere
of
but
only
as
men
and
for
their
conduct
in
mere
matters
of
and
that
in
hegel
case
we
were
talking
of
theories
in
this
way
i
parried
the
attack
the
first
three
tricks
are
of
a
kindred
character
they
have
this
in
common
that
something
different
is
attacked
from
that
which
was
asserted
it
would
therefore
be
an
to
allow
oneself
to
be
disposed
of
in
such
a
manner
for
in
all
the
examples
that
i
have
given
what
the
opponent
says
is
true
but
it
stands
in
apparent
and
not
in
real
contradiction
with
the
thesis
all
that
the
man
whom
he
is
attacking
has
to
do
is
to
deny
the
validity
of
his
syllogism
to
deny
namely
the
conclusion
which
he
draws
that
because
his
proposition
is
true
ours
is
false
in
this
way
his
refutation
is
itself
directly
refuted
by
a
denial
of
his
conclusion
negationem
another
trick
is
to
refuse
to
admit
true
premisses
because
of
a
foreseen
conclusion
there
are
two
ways
of
defeating
it
incorporated
in
the
next
two
sections
iv
if
you
want
to
draw
a
conclusion
you
must
not
let
it
be
foreseen
but
you
must
get
the
premisses
admitted
one
by
one
unobserved
mingling
them
here
and
there
in
your
talk
otherwise
your
opponent
will
attempt
all
sorts
of
chicanery
or
if
it
is
doubtful
whether
your
opponent
will
admit
them
you
must
advance
the
premisses
of
these
premisses
that
is
to
say
you
must
draw
up
and
get
the
premisses
of
several
of
them
admitted
in
no
definite
order
in
this
way
you
conceal
your
game
until
you
have
obtained
all
the
admissions
that
are
necessary
and
so
reach
your
goal
by
making
a
circuit
these
rules
are
given
by
aristotle
in
his
bk
it
is
a
trick
which
needs
no
illustration
to
prove
the
truth
of
a
proposition
you
may
also
employ
previous
propositions
that
are
not
true
should
your
opponent
refuse
to
admit
the
true
ones
either
because
he
fails
to
perceive
their
truth
or
because
he
sees
that
the
thesis
immediately
follows
from
them
in
that
case
the
plan
is
to
take
propositions
which
are
false
in
themselves
but
true
for
your
opponent
and
argue
from
the
way
in
which
he
thinks
that
is
to
say
for
a
true
conclusion
may
follow
from
false
premisses
but
not
in
the
same
fashion
your
opponent
false
propositions
may
be
refuted
by
other
false
propositions
which
he
however
takes
to
be
true
for
it
is
with
him
that
you
have
to
do
and
you
must
use
the
thoughts
that
he
uses
for
instance
if
he
is
a
member
of
some
sect
to
which
you
do
not
belong
you
may
employ
the
declared
opinions
of
this
sect
against
him
as
principles
footnote
aristotle
bk
chap
vi
another
plan
is
to
beg
the
question
in
disguise
by
postulating
what
has
to
be
proved
either
under
another
name
for
instance
good
repute
instead
of
honour
virtue
instead
of
virginity
etc
or
by
using
such
convertible
terms
as
animals
and
vertebrates
or
by
making
a
general
assumption
covering
the
particular
point
in
dispute
for
instance
maintaining
the
uncertainty
of
medicine
by
postulating
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
knowledge
if
two
things
follow
one
from
the
other
and
one
is
to
be
proved
you
may
postulate
the
other
if
a
general
proposition
is
to
be
proved
you
may
get
your
opponent
to
admit
every
one
of
the
particulars
this
is
the
converse
of
the
second
footnote
chap
the
last
chapter
of
this
work
contains
some
good
rules
for
the
practice
of
dialectics
vii
should
the
disputation
be
conducted
on
somewhat
strict
and
formal
lines
and
there
be
a
desire
to
arrive
at
a
very
clear
understanding
he
who
states
the
proposition
and
wants
to
prove
it
may
proceed
against
his
opponent
by
question
in
order
to
show
the
truth
of
the
statement
from
his
admissions
the
erotematic
or
socratic
method
was
especially
in
use
among
the
ancients
and
this
and
some
of
the
tricks
following
later
on
are
akin
to
it
footnote
they
are
all
a
free
version
of
chap
of
sophistici
the
plan
is
to
ask
a
great
many
questions
at
once
so
as
to
hide
what
you
want
to
get
admitted
and
on
the
other
hand
quickly
propound
the
argument
resulting
from
the
admissions
for
those
who
are
slow
of
understanding
can
not
follow
accurately
and
do
not
notice
any
mistakes
or
gaps
there
may
be
in
the
demonstration
viii
this
trick
consists
in
making
your
opponent
angry
for
when
he
is
angry
he
is
incapable
of
judging
aright
and
perceiving
where
his
advantage
lies
you
can
make
him
angry
by
doing
him
repeated
injustice
or
practising
some
kind
of
chicanery
and
being
generally
insolent
ix
or
you
may
put
questions
in
an
order
different
from
that
which
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
them
requires
and
transpose
them
so
as
not
to
let
him
know
at
what
you
are
aiming
he
can
then
take
no
precautions
you
may
also
use
his
answers
for
different
or
even
opposite
conclusions
according
to
their
character
this
is
akin
to
the
trick
of
masking
your
procedure
x
if
you
observe
that
your
opponent
designedly
returns
a
negative
answer
to
the
questions
which
for
the
sake
of
your
proposition
you
want
him
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
you
must
ask
the
converse
of
the
proposition
as
though
it
were
that
which
you
were
anxious
to
see
affirmed
or
at
any
rate
you
may
give
him
his
choice
of
both
so
that
he
may
not
perceive
which
of
them
you
are
asking
him
to
affirm
xl
if
you
make
an
induction
and
your
opponent
grants
you
the
particular
cases
by
which
it
is
to
be
supported
you
must
refrain
from
asking
him
if
he
also
admits
the
general
truth
which
issues
from
the
particulars
but
introduce
it
afterwards
as
a
settled
and
admitted
fact
for
in
the
meanwhile
he
will
himself
come
to
believe
that
he
has
admitted
it
and
the
same
impression
will
be
received
by
the
audience
because
they
will
remember
the
many
questions
as
to
the
particulars
and
suppose
that
they
must
of
course
have
attained
their
end
xii
if
the
conversation
turns
upon
some
general
conception
which
has
no
particular
name
but
requires
some
figurative
or
metaphorical
designation
you
must
begin
by
choosing
a
metaphor
that
is
favourable
to
your
proposition
for
instance
the
names
used
to
denote
the
two
political
parties
in
spain
and
are
obviously
chosen
by
the
latter
the
name
is
chosen
by
themselves
and
also
the
name
but
the
catholics
call
them
similarly
in
regard
to
the
names
of
things
which
admit
of
a
more
exact
and
definite
meaning
for
example
if
your
opponent
proposes
an
you
can
call
it
an
as
this
is
an
invidious
word
if
you
yourself
make
the
proposal
it
will
be
the
converse
in
the
first
case
you
can
call
the
antagonistic
principle
the
existing
order
in
the
second
antiquated
prejudice
what
an
impartial
man
with
no
further
purpose
to
serve
would
call
public
worship
or
a
system
of
religion
is
described
by
an
adherent
as
piety
godliness
and
by
an
opponent
as
bigotry
superstition
this
is
at
bottom
a
subtle
what
is
sought
to
be
proved
is
first
of
all
inserted
in
the
definition
whence
it
is
then
taken
by
mere
analysis
what
one
man
calls
placing
in
safe
custody
another
calls
throwing
into
prison
a
speaker
often
betrays
his
purpose
beforehand
by
the
names
which
he
gives
to
things
one
man
talks
of
the
clergy
another
of
the
priests
of
all
the
tricks
of
controversy
this
is
the
most
frequent
and
it
is
used
instinctively
you
hear
of
religious
zeal
or
fanaticism
a
a
piece
of
gallantry
or
adultery
an
equivocal
or
a
bawdy
story
embarrassment
or
bankruptcy
through
influence
and
connection
or
by
bribery
and
nepotism
sincere
gratitude
or
good
pay
xiii
to
make
your
opponent
accept
a
proposition
you
must
give
him
the
as
well
leaving
him
his
choice
of
the
two
and
you
must
render
the
contrast
as
glaring
as
you
can
so
that
to
avoid
being
paradoxical
he
will
accept
the
proposition
which
is
thus
made
to
look
quite
probable
for
instance
if
you
want
to
make
him
admit
that
a
boy
must
do
everything
that
his
father
tells
him
to
do
ask
him
whether
in
all
things
we
must
obey
or
disobey
our
parents
or
if
a
thing
is
said
to
occur
often
ask
whether
by
often
you
are
to
understand
few
or
many
cases
and
he
will
say
many
it
is
as
though
you
were
to
put
grey
next
black
and
call
it
white
or
next
white
and
call
it
black
xiv
this
which
is
an
impudent
trick
is
played
as
follows
when
your
opponent
has
answered
several
of
your
questions
without
the
answers
turning
out
favourable
to
the
conclusion
at
which
you
are
aiming
advance
the
desired
conclusion
although
it
does
not
in
the
least
follow
as
though
it
had
been
proved
and
proclaim
it
in
a
tone
of
triumph
if
your
opponent
is
shy
or
stupid
and
you
yourself
possess
a
great
deal
of
impudence
and
a
good
voice
the
trick
may
easily
succeed
it
is
akin
to
the
fallacy
causae
ut
xv
if
you
have
advanced
a
paradoxical
proposition
and
find
a
difficulty
in
proving
it
you
may
submit
for
your
opponent
acceptance
or
rejection
some
true
proposition
the
truth
of
which
however
is
not
quite
palpable
as
though
you
wished
to
draw
your
proof
from
it
should
he
reject
it
because
he
suspects
a
trick
you
can
obtain
your
triumph
by
showing
how
absurd
he
is
should
he
accept
it
you
have
got
reason
on
your
side
for
the
moment
and
must
now
look
about
you
or
else
you
can
employ
the
previous
trick
as
well
and
maintain
that
your
paradox
is
proved
by
the
proposition
which
he
has
accepted
for
this
an
extreme
degree
of
impudence
is
required
but
experience
shows
cases
of
it
and
there
are
people
who
practise
it
by
instinct
xvi
another
trick
is
to
use
arguments
or
when
your
opponent
makes
a
proposition
you
must
try
to
see
whether
it
is
not
in
some
way
if
needs
be
only
apparently
inconsistent
with
some
other
proposition
which
he
has
made
or
admitted
or
with
the
principles
of
a
school
or
sect
which
he
has
commended
and
approved
or
with
the
actions
of
those
who
support
the
sect
or
else
of
those
who
give
it
only
an
apparent
and
spurious
support
or
with
his
own
actions
or
want
of
action
for
example
should
he
defend
suicide
you
may
at
once
exclaim
why
do
you
hang
yourself
should
he
maintain
that
berlin
is
an
unpleasant
place
to
live
in
you
may
say
why
do
you
leave
by
the
first
train
some
such
claptrap
is
always
possible

taken
in
any
ambiguous
sense
xviii
if
you
observe
that
your
opponent
has
taken
up
a
line
of
argument
which
will
end
in
your
defeat
you
must
not
allow
him
to
carry
it
to
its
conclusion
but
interrupt
the
course
of
the
dispute
in
time
or
break
it
off
altogether
or
lead
him
away
from
the
subject
and
bring
him
to
others
in
short
you
must
effect
the
trick
which
will
be
noticed
later
on
the
see
xxix
xix
should
your
opponent
expressly
challenge
you
to
produce
any
objection
to
some
definite
point
in
his
argument
and
you
have
nothing
much
to
say
you
must
try
to
give
the
matter
a
general
turn
and
then
talk
against
that
if
you
are
called
upon
to
say
why
a
particular
physical
hypothesis
can
not
be
accepted
you
may
speak
of
the
fallibility
of
human
knowledge
and
give
various
illustrations
of
it
xx
when
you
have
elicited
all
your
premisses
and
your
opponent
has
admitted
them
you
must
refrain
from
asking
him
for
the
conclusion
but
draw
it
at
once
for
yourself
nay
even
though
one
or
other
of
the
premisses
should
be
lacking
you
may
take
it
as
though
it
too
had
been
admitted
and
draw
the
conclusion
this
trick
is
an
application
of
the
fallacy
causae
ut
xxi
when
your
opponent
uses
a
merely
superficial
or
sophistical
argument
and
you
see
through
it
you
can
it
is
true
refute
it
by
setting
forth
its
captious
and
superficial
character
but
it
is
better
to
meet
him
with
a
which
is
just
as
superficial
and
sophistical
and
so
dispose
of
him
for
it
is
with
victory
that
you
are
concerned
and
not
with
truth
if
for
example
he
adopts
an
ad
it
is
sufficient
to
take
the
force
out
of
it
by
a
counter
ad
or
ex
and
in
general
instead
of
setting
forth
the
true
state
of
the
case
at
equal
length
it
is
shorter
to
take
this
course
if
it
lies
open
to
you
xxii
if
your
opponent
requires
you
to
admit
something
from
which
the
point
in
dispute
will
immediately
follow
you
must
refuse
to
do
so
declaring
that
it
is
a
for
he
and
the
audience
will
regard
a
proposition
which
is
near
akin
to
the
point
in
dispute
as
identical
with
it
and
in
this
way
you
deprive
him
of
his
best
argument
xxiii
contradiction
and
contention
irritate
a
man
into
exaggerating
his
statement
by
contradicting
your
opponent
you
may
drive
him
into
extending
beyond
its
proper
limits
a
statement
which
at
all
events
within
those
limits
and
in
itself
is
true
and
when
you
refute
this
exaggerated
form
of
it
you
look
as
though
you
had
also
refuted
his
original
statement
contrarily
you
must
take
care
not
to
allow
yourself
to
be
misled
by
contradictions
into
exaggerating
or
extending
a
statement
of
your
own
it
will
often
happen
that
your
opponent
will
himself
directly
try
to
extend
your
statement
further
than
you
meant
it
here
you
must
at
once
stop
him
and
bring
him
back
to
the
limits
which
you
set
up
that
what
i
said
and
no
more
xxiv
this
trick
consists
in
stating
a
false
syllogism
your
opponent
makes
a
proposition
and
by
false
inference
and
distortion
of
his
ideas
you
force
from
it
other
propositions
which
it
does
not
contain
and
he
does
not
in
the
least
mean
nay
which
are
absurd
or
dangerous
it
then
looks
as
if
his
proposition
gave
rise
to
others
which
are
inconsistent
either
with
themselves
or
with
some
acknowledged
truth
and
so
it
appears
to
be
indirectly
refuted
this
is
the
and
it
is
another
application
of
the
fallacy
causae
ut
xxv
this
is
a
case
of
the
by
means
of
an
to
the
with
an
induction
greek
epagogae
a
great
number
of
particular
instances
are
required
in
order
to
establish
it
as
a
universal
proposition
but
with
the
greek
apagogae
a
single
instance
to
which
the
proposition
does
not
apply
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
overthrow
it
this
is
a
controversial
method
known
as
the
greek
enstasis
for
example
all
ruminants
are
horned
is
a
proposition
which
may
be
upset
by
the
single
instance
of
the
camel
the
is
a
case
in
which
a
universal
truth
is
sought
to
be
applied
and
something
is
inserted
in
the
fundamental
definition
of
it
which
is
not
universally
true
and
by
which
it
is
upset
but
there
is
room
for
mistake
and
when
this
trick
is
employed
by
your
opponent
you
must
observe
whether
the
example
which
he
gives
is
really
true
for
there
are
problems
of
which
the
only
true
solution
is
that
the
case
in
point
is
not
true
for
example
many
miracles
ghost
stories
and
so
on
and
whether
it
really
comes
under
the
conception
of
the
truth
thus
stated
for
it
may
only
appear
to
do
so
and
the
matter
is
one
to
be
settled
by
precise
distinctions
and
whether
it
is
really
inconsistent
with
this
conception
for
this
again
may
be
only
an
apparent
inconsistency
xxvi
a
brilliant
move
is
the
or
turning
of
the
tables
by
which
your
opponent
argument
is
turned
against
himself
he
declares
for
instance
is
a
child
you
must
make
allowance
for
him
you
retort
just
because
he
is
a
child
i
must
correct
him
otherwise
he
will
persist
in
his
bad
habits
xxvii
should
your
opponent
surprise
you
by
becoming
particularly
angry
at
an
argument
you
must
urge
it
with
all
the
more
zeal
not
only
because
it
is
a
good
thing
to
make
him
angry
but
because
it
may
be
presumed
that
you
have
here
put
your
finger
on
the
weak
side
of
his
case
and
that
just
here
he
is
more
open
to
attack
than
even
for
the
moment
you
perceive
xxviii
this
is
chiefly
practicable
in
a
dispute
between
scholars
in
the
presence
of
the
unlearned
if
you
have
no
argument
and
none
either
you
can
make
one
that
is
to
say
you
can
start
some
invalid
objection
which
however
only
an
expert
sees
to
be
invalid
now
your
opponent
is
an
expert
but
those
who
form
your
audience
are
not
and
accordingly
in
their
eyes
he
is
defeated
particularly
if
the
objection
which
you
make
places
him
in
any
ridiculous
light
people
are
ready
to
laugh
and
you
have
the
laughers
on
your
side
to
show
that
your
objection
is
an
idle
one
would
require
a
long
explanation
on
the
part
of
your
opponent
and
a
reference
to
the
principles
of
the
branch
of
knowledge
in
question
or
to
the
elements
of
the
matter
which
you
are
discussing
and
people
are
not
disposed
to
listen
to
it
for
example
your
opponent
states
that
in
the
original
formation
of
a
the
granite
and
other
elements
in
its
composition
were
by
reason
of
their
high
temperature
in
a
fluid
or
molten
state
that
the
temperature
must
have
amounted
to
some
fahrenheit
and
that
when
the
mass
took
shape
it
was
covered
by
the
sea
you
reply
by
an
argument
that
at
that
temperature
nay
indeed
long
before
it
had
been
reached
namely
at
fahrenheit
the
sea
would
have
been
boiled
away
and
spread
through
the
air
in
the
form
of
steam
at
this
the
audience
laughs
to
refute
the
objection
your
opponent
would
have
to
show
that
the
depends
not
only
on
the
degree
of
warmth
but
also
on
the
atmospheric
pressure
and
that
as
soon
as
about
half
the
had
gone
off
in
the
shape
of
steam
this
pressure
would
be
so
greatly
increased
that
the
rest
of
it
would
fail
to
boil
even
at
a
temperature
of
he
is
debarred
from
giving
this
explanation
as
it
would
require
a
treatise
to
demonstrate
the
matter
to
those
who
had
no
acquaintance
with
physics

if
you
find
that
you
are
being
worsted
you
can
make
a
that
is
you
can
suddenly
begin
to
talk
of
something
else
as
though
it
had
a
bearing
on
the
matter
in
dispute
and
afforded
an
argument
against
your
opponent
this
may
be
done
without
presumption
if
the
diversion
has
in
fact
some
general
bearing
on
the
matter
but
it
is
a
piece
of
impudence
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
and
is
only
brought
in
by
way
of
attacking
your
opponent
for
example
i
praised
the
system
prevailing
in
china
where
there
is
no
such
thing
as
hereditary
nobility
and
offices
are
bestowed
only
on
those
who
succeed
in
competitive
examinations
my
opponent
maintained
that
learning
as
little
as
the
privilege
of
birth
of
which
he
had
a
high
opinion
fits
a
man
for
office
we
argued
and
he
got
the
worst
of
it
then
he
made
a
diversion
and
declared
that
in
china
all
ranks
were
punished
with
the
bastinado
which
he
connected
with
the
immoderate
indulgence
in
tea
and
proceeded
to
make
both
of
them
a
subject
of
reproach
to
the
chinese
to
follow
him
into
all
this
would
have
been
to
allow
oneself
to
be
drawn
into
a
surrender
of
the
victory
which
had
already
been
won
the
diversion
is
mere
impudence
if
it
completely
abandons
the
point
in
dispute
and
raises
for
instance
some
such
objection
as
yes
and
you
also
said
just
now
and
so
on
for
then
the
argument
becomes
to
some
extent
personal
of
the
kind
which
will
be
treated
of
in
the
last
section
strictly
speaking
it
is
between
the
ad
which
will
there
be
discussed
and
the
ad
how
very
innate
this
trick
is
may
be
seen
in
every
quarrel
between
common
people
if
one
of
the
parties
makes
some
personal
reproach
against
the
other
the
latter
instead
of
answering
it
by
refuting
it
allows
it
to
stand
as
it
were
admits
it
and
replies
by
reproaching
his
antagonist
on
some
other
ground
this
is
a
stratagem
like
that
pursued
by
scipio
when
he
attacked
the
carthaginians
not
in
italy
but
in
africa
in
war
diversions
of
this
kind
may
be
profitable
but
in
a
quarrel
they
are
poor
expedients
because
the
reproaches
remain
and
those
who
look
on
hear
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
both
parties
it
is
a
trick
that
should
be
used
only
de
xxx
this
is
the
ad
it
consists
in
making
an
appeal
to
authority
rather
than
reason
and
in
using
such
an
authority
as
may
suit
the
degree
of
knowledge
possessed
by
your
opponent
every
man
prefers
belief
to
the
exercise
of
judgment
says
seneca
and
it
is
therefore
an
easy
matter
if
you
have
an
authority
on
your
side
which
your
opponent
respects
the
more
limited
his
capacity
and
knowledge
the
greater
is
the
number
of
the
authorities
who
weigh
with
him
but
if
his
capacity
and
knowledge
are
of
a
high
order
there
are
very
few
indeed
hardly
any
at
all
he
may
perhaps
admit
the
authority
of
professional
men
versed
in
a
science
or
an
art
or
a
handicraft
of
which
he
knows
little
or
nothing
but
even
so
he
will
regard
it
with
suspicion
contrarily
ordinary
folk
have
a
deep
respect
for
professional
men
of
every
kind
they
are
unaware
that
a
man
who
makes
a
profession
of
a
thing
loves
it
not
for
the
thing
itself
but
for
the
money
he
makes
by
it
or
that
it
is
rare
for
a
man
who
teaches
to
know
his
subject
thoroughly
for
if
he
studies
it
as
he
ought
he
has
in
most
cases
no
time
left
in
which
to
teach
it
but
there
are
very
many
authorities
who
find
respect
with
the
mob
and
if
you
have
none
that
is
quite
suitable
you
can
take
one
that
appears
to
be
so
you
may
quote
what
some
said
in
another
sense
or
in
other
circumstances
authorities
which
your
opponent
fails
to
understand
are
those
of
which
he
generally
thinks
the
most
the
unlearned
entertain
a
peculiar
respect
for
a
greek
or
a
latin
flourish
you
may
also
should
it
be
necessary
not
only
twist
your
authorities
but
actually
falsify
them
or
quote
something
which
you
have
invented
entirely
yourself
as
a
rule
your
opponent
has
no
books
at
hand
and
could
not
use
them
if
he
had
the
finest
illustration
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
french
who
to
avoid
being
compelled
like
other
citizens
to
pave
the
street
in
front
of
his
house
quoted
a
saying
which
he
described
as
biblical
illi
ego
non
that
was
quite
enough
for
the
municipal
officers
a
universal
prejudice
may
also
be
used
as
an
authority
for
most
people
think
with
aristotle
that
that
may
be
said
to
exist
which
many
believe
there
is
no
opinion
however
absurd
which
men
will
not
readily
embrace
as
soon
as
they
can
be
brought
to
the
conviction
that
it
is
generally
adopted
example
affects
their
thought
just
as
it
affects
their
action
they
are
like
sheep
following
the
just
as
he
leads
them
they
would
sooner
die
than
think
it
is
very
curious
that
the
universality
of
an
opinion
should
have
so
much
weight
with
people
as
their
own
experience
might
tell
them
that
its
acceptance
is
an
entirely
thoughtless
and
merely
imitative
process
but
it
tells
them
nothing
of
the
kind
because
they
possess
no
whatever
it
is
only
the
elect
who
say
with
plato
greek
tois
pollois
polla
dokei
which
means
that
the
public
has
a
good
many
bees
in
its
bonnet
and
that
it
would
be
a
long
business
to
get
at
them
but
to
speak
seriously
the
universality
of
an
opinion
is
no
proof
nay
it
is
not
even
a
probability
that
the
opinion
is
right
those
who
maintain
that
it
is
so
must
assume
that
length
of
time
deprives
a
universal
opinion
of
its
demonstrative
force
as
otherwise
all
the
old
errors
which
were
once
universally
held
to
be
true
would
have
to
be
recalled
for
instance
the
ptolemaic
system
would
have
to
be
restored
or
catholicism
in
all
protestant
countries
they
must
assume
that
distance
of
space
has
the
same
effect
otherwise
the
respective
universality
of
opinion
among
the
adherents
of
buddhism
christianity
and
islam
will
put
them
in
a
difficulty
when
we
come
to
look
into
the
matter
universal
opinion
is
the
opinion
of
two
or
three
persons
and
we
should
be
persuaded
of
this
if
we
could
see
the
way
in
which
it
really
arises
we
should
find
that
it
is
two
or
three
persons
who
in
the
first
instance
accepted
it
or
advanced
and
maintained
it
and
of
whom
people
were
so
good
as
to
believe
that
they
had
thoroughly
tested
it
then
a
few
other
persons
persuaded
beforehand
that
the
first
were
men
of
the
requisite
capacity
also
accepted
the
opinion
these
again
were
trusted
by
many
others
whose
laziness
suggested
to
them
that
it
was
better
to
believe
at
once
than
to
go
through
the
troublesome
task
of
testing
the
matter
for
themselves
thus
the
number
of
these
lazy
and
credulous
adherents
grew
from
day
to
day
for
the
opinion
had
no
sooner
obtained
a
fair
measure
of
support
than
its
further
supporters
attributed
this
to
the
fact
that
the
opinion
could
only
have
obtained
it
by
the
cogency
of
its
arguments
the
remainder
were
then
compelled
to
grant
what
was
universally
granted
so
as
not
to
pass
for
unruly
persons
who
resisted
opinions
which
every
one
accepted
or
pert
fellows
who
thought
themselves
cleverer
than
any
one
else
when
opinion
reaches
this
stage
adhesion
becomes
a
duty
and
henceforward
the
few
who
are
capable
of
forming
a
judgment
hold
their
peace
those
who
venture
to
speak
are
such
as
are
entirely
incapable
of
forming
any
opinions
or
any
judgment
of
their
own
being
merely
the
echo
of
others
opinions
and
nevertheless
they
defend
them
with
all
the
greater
zeal
and
intolerance
for
what
they
hate
in
people
who
think
differently
is
not
so
much
the
different
opinions
which
they
profess
as
the
presumption
of
wanting
to
form
their
own
judgment
a
presumption
of
which
they
themselves
are
never
guilty
as
they
are
very
well
aware
in
short
there
are
very
few
who
can
think
but
every
man
wants
to
have
an
opinion
and
what
remains
but
to
take
it
from
others
instead
of
forming
opinions
for
himself
since
this
is
what
happens
where
is
the
value
of
the
opinion
even
of
a
hundred
millions
it
is
no
more
established
than
an
historical
fact
reported
by
a
hundred
chroniclers
who
can
be
proved
to
have
plagiarised
it
from
one
another
the
opinion
in
the
end
being
traceable
to
a
single
individual
it
is
all
what
i
say
what
you
say
and
finally
what
he
says
and
the
whole
of
it
is
nothing
but
a
series
of
assertions

nevertheless
in
a
dispute
with
ordinary
people
we
may
employ
universal
opinion
as
an
authority
for
it
will
generally
be
found
that
when
two
of
them
are
fighting
that
is
the
weapon
which
both
of
them
choose
as
a
means
of
attack
if
a
man
of
the
better
sort
has
to
deal
with
them
it
is
most
advisable
for
him
to
condescend
to
the
use
of
this
weapon
too
and
to
select
such
authorities
as
will
make
an
impression
on
his
opponent
weak
side
for
he
is
as
insensible
to
all
rational
argument
as
a
siegfried
dipped
in
the
flood
of
incapacity
and
unable
to
think
or
judge
before
a
tribunal
the
dispute
is
one
between
authorities
alone
such
authoritative
statements
i
mean
as
are
laid
down
by
legal
experts
and
here
the
exercise
of
judgment
consists
in
discovering
what
law
or
authority
applies
to
the
case
in
question
there
is
however
plenty
of
room
for
dialectic
for
should
the
case
in
question
and
the
law
not
really
fit
each
other
they
can
if
necessary
be
twisted
until
they
appear
to
do
so
or
xxxi
if
you
know
that
you
have
no
reply
to
the
arguments
which
your
opponent
advances
you
may
by
a
fine
stroke
of
irony
declare
yourself
to
be
an
incompetent
judge
what
you
now
say
passes
my
poor
powers
of
comprehension
it
may
be
all
very
true
but
i
understand
it
and
i
refrain
from
any
expression
of
opinion
on
it
in
this
way
you
insinuate
to
the
bystanders
with
whom
you
are
in
good
repute
that
what
your
opponent
says
is
nonsense
thus
when
appeared
or
rather
when
it
began
to
make
a
noise
in
the
world
many
professors
of
the
old
ecclectic
school
declared
that
they
failed
to
understand
it
in
the
belief
that
their
failure
settled
the
business
but
when
the
adherents
of
the
new
school
proved
to
them
that
they
were
quite
right
and
had
really
failed
to
understand
it
they
were
in
a
very
bad
humour
this
is
a
trick
which
may
be
used
only
when
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
audience
thinks
much
better
of
you
that
of
your
opponent
a
professor
for
instance
may
try
it
on
a
student
strictly
it
is
a
case
of
the
preceding
trick
it
is
a
particularly
malicious
assertion
of
one
own
authority
instead
of
giving
reasons
the
is
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
but
with
your
penetrating
intellect
it
must
be
very
easy
for
you
to
understand
anything
and
it
can
only
be
my
poor
statement
of
the
matter
that
is
at
fault
and
then
go
on
to
rub
it
into
him
until
he
understands
it
and
sees
for
himself
that
it
was
really
his
own
fault
alone
in
this
way
you
parry
his
attack
with
the
greatest
politeness
he
wanted
to
insinuate
that
you
were
talking
nonsense
and
you
with
equal
courtesy
prove
to
him
that
he
is
a
fool
xxxii
if
you
are
confronted
with
an
assertion
there
is
a
short
way
of
getting
rid
of
it
or
at
any
rate
of
throwing
suspicion
on
it
by
putting
it
into
some
odious
category
even
though
the
connection
is
only
apparent
or
else
of
a
loose
character
you
can
say
for
instance
that
is
manichasism
or
it
is
arianism
or
pelagianism
or
idealism
or
spinozism
or
pantheism
or
brownianism
or
naturalism
or
atheism
or
rationalism
spiritualism
mysticism
and
so
on
in
making
an
objection
of
this
kind
you
take
it
for
granted
that
the
assertion
in
question
is
identical
with
or
is
at
least
contained
in
the
category
cited
that
is
to
say
you
cry
out
oh
i
have
heard
that
before
and
that
the
system
referred
to
has
been
entirely
refuted
and
does
not
contain
a
word
of
truth
xxxiii
that
all
very
well
in
theory
but
it
wo
do
in
practice
in
this
sophism
you
admit
the
premisses
but
deny
the
conclusion
in
contradiction
with
a
rule
of
logic
the
assertion
is
based
upon
an
impossibility
what
is
right
in
theory
work
in
practice
and
if
it
does
not
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
theory
something
has
been
overlooked
and
not
allowed
for
and
consequently
what
is
wrong
in
practice
is
wrong
in
theory
too
xxxiv
when
you
state
a
question
or
an
argument
and
your
opponent
gives
you
no
direct
answer
or
reply
but
evades
it
by
a
or
an
indirect
answer
or
some
assertion
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
matter
and
generally
tries
to
turn
the
subject
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
you
have
touched
a
weak
spot
sometimes
without
knowing
it
you
have
as
it
were
reduced
him
to
silence
you
must
therefore
urge
the
point
all
the
more
and
not
let
your
opponent
evade
it
even
when
you
do
not
know
where
the
weakness
which
you
have
hit
upon
really
lies
xxxv
there
is
another
trick
which
as
soon
as
it
is
practicable
makes
all
others
unnecessary
instead
of
working
on
your
opponent
intellect
by
argument
work
on
his
will
by
motive
and
he
and
also
the
audience
if
they
have
similar
interests
will
at
once
be
won
over
to
your
opinion
even
though
you
got
it
out
of
a
lunatic
asylum
for
as
a
general
rule
half
an
ounce
of
will
is
more
effective
than
a
hundredweight
of
insight
and
intelligence
this
it
is
true
can
be
done
only
under
peculiar
circumstances
if
you
succeed
in
making
your
opponent
feel
that
his
opinion
should
it
prove
true
will
be
distinctly
prejudicial
to
his
interest
he
will
let
it
drop
like
a
hot
potato
and
feel
that
it
was
very
imprudent
to
take
it
up
a
clergyman
for
instance
is
defending
some
philosophical
dogma
you
make
him
sensible
of
the
fact
that
it
is
in
immediate
contradiction
with
one
of
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
his
church
and
he
abandons
it
a
landed
proprietor
maintains
that
the
use
of
machinery
in
agricultural
operations
as
practised
in
england
is
an
excellent
institution
since
an
engine
does
the
work
of
many
men
you
give
him
to
understand
that
it
will
not
be
very
long
before
carriages
are
also
worked
by
steam
and
that
the
value
of
his
large
stud
will
be
greatly
depreciated
and
you
will
see
what
he
will
say
in
such
cases
every
man
feels
how
thoughtless
it
is
to
sanction
a
law
unjust
to
himself
temere
in
nosmet
legem
sancimus
nor
is
it
otherwise
if
the
bystanders
but
not
your
opponent
belong
to
the
same
sect
guild
industry
club
as
yourself
let
his
thesis
be
never
so
true
as
soon
as
you
hint
that
it
is
prejudicial
to
the
common
interests
of
the
said
society
all
the
bystanders
will
find
that
your
opponent
arguments
however
excellent
they
be
are
weak
and
contemptible
and
that
yours
on
the
other
hand
though
they
were
random
conjecture
are
correct
and
to
the
point
you
will
have
a
chorus
of
loud
approval
on
your
side
and
your
opponent
will
be
driven
out
of
the
field
with
ignominy
nay
the
bystanders
will
believe
as
a
rule
that
they
have
agreed
with
you
out
of
pure
conviction
for
what
is
not
to
our
interest
mostly
seems
absurd
to
us
our
intellect
being
no
this
trick
might
be
called
taking
the
tree
by
its
root
its
usual
name
is
the
ab
xxxvi
you
may
also
puzzle
and
bewilder
your
opponent
by
mere
bombast
and
the
trick
is
possible
because
a
man
generally
supposes
that
there
must
be
some
meaning
in
words
glaubt
der
mensch
wenn
er
nur
worte
h√∂rt
es
m√ºsse
sich
dabei
doch
auch
was
denken
if
he
is
secretly
conscious
of
his
own
weakness
and
accustomed
to
hear
much
that
he
does
not
understand
and
to
make
as
though
he
did
you
can
easily
impose
upon
him
by
some
serious
fooling
that
sounds
very
deep
or
learned
and
deprives
him
of
hearing
sight
and
thought
and
by
giving
out
that
it
is
the
most
indisputable
proof
of
what
you
assert
it
is
a
fact
that
in
recent
times
some
philosophers
have
practised
this
trick
on
the
whole
of
the
public
with
the
most
brilliant
success
but
since
present
examples
are
odious
we
may
refer
to
vicar
of
for
an
old
one
xxxvii
should
your
opponent
be
in
the
right
but
luckily
for
your
contention
choose
a
faulty
proof
you
can
easily
manage
to
refute
it
and
then
claim
that
you
have
thus
refuted
his
whole
position
this
is
a
trick
which
ought
to
be
one
of
the
first
it
is
at
bottom
an
expedient
by
which
an
ad
is
put
forward
as
an
ad
if
no
accurate
proof
occurs
to
him
or
to
the
bystanders
you
have
won
the
day
for
example
if
a
man
advances
the
ontological
argument
by
way
of
proving
god
existence
you
can
get
the
best
of
him
for
the
ontological
argument
may
easily
be
refuted
this
is
the
way
in
which
bad
advocates
lose
a
good
case
by
trying
to
justify
it
by
an
authority
which
does
not
fit
it
when
no
fitting
one
occurs
to
them
xxxviii
a
last
trick
is
to
become
personal
insulting
rude
as
soon
as
you
perceive
that
your
opponent
has
the
upper
hand
and
that
you
are
going
to
come
off
worst
it
consists
in
passing
from
the
subject
of
dispute
as
from
a
lost
game
to
the
disputant
himself
and
in
some
way
attacking
his
person
it
may
be
called
the
ad
to
distinguish
it
from
the
ad
which
passes
from
the
objective
discussion
of
the
subject
pure
and
simple
to
the
statements
or
admissions
which
your
opponent
has
made
in
regard
to
it
but
in
becoming
personal
you
leave
the
subject
altogether
and
turn
your
attack
to
his
person
by
remarks
of
an
offensive
and
spiteful
character
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
virtues
of
the
intellect
to
the
virtues
of
the
body
or
to
mere
animalism
this
is
a
very
popular
trick
because
every
one
is
able
to
carry
it
into
effect
and
so
it
is
of
frequent
application
now
the
question
is
what
avails
for
the
other
party
for
if
he
has
recourse
to
the
same
rule
there
will
be
blows
or
a
duel
or
an
action
for
slander
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
it
is
sufficient
not
to
become
personal
yourself
for
by
showing
a
man
quite
quietly
that
he
is
wrong
and
that
what
he
says
and
thinks
is
incorrect
a
process
which
occurs
in
every
dialectical
victory
you
embitter
him
more
than
if
you
used
some
rude
or
insulting
expression
why
is
this
because
as
hobbes
observes
all
mental
pleasure
consists
in
being
able
to
compare
oneself
with
others
to
one
own
advantage
nothing
is
of
greater
moment
to
a
man
than
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
and
no
wound
is
more
painful
than
that
which
is
inflicted
on
it
hence
such
phrases
as
death
before
dishonour
and
so
on
the
gratification
of
vanity
arises
mainly
by
comparison
of
oneself
with
others
in
every
respect
but
chiefly
in
respect
of
one
intellectual
powers
and
so
the
most
effective
and
the
strongest
gratification
of
it
is
to
be
found
in
controversy
hence
the
embitterment
of
defeat
apart
from
any
question
of
injustice
and
hence
recourse
to
that
last
weapon
that
last
trick
which
you
can
not
evade
by
mere
politeness
a
cool
demeanour
may
however
help
you
here
if
as
soon
as
your
opponent
becomes
personal
you
quietly
reply
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
point
in
dispute
and
immediately
bring
the
conversation
back
to
it
and
continue
to
show
him
that
he
is
wrong
without
taking
any
notice
of
his
insults
say
as
themistocles
said
to
eurybiades
but
hear
but
such
demeanour
is
not
given
to
every
one
footnote
philosophica
de
as
a
sharpening
of
wits
controversy
is
often
indeed
of
mutual
advantage
in
order
to
correct
one
thoughts
and
awaken
new
views
but
in
learning
and
in
mental
power
both
disputants
must
be
tolerably
equal
if
one
of
them
lacks
learning
he
will
fail
to
understand
the
other
as
he
is
not
on
the
same
level
with
his
antagonist
if
he
lacks
mental
power
he
will
be
embittered
and
led
into
dishonest
tricks
and
end
by
being
rude
the
only
safe
rule
therefore
is
that
which
aristotle
mentions
in
the
last
chapter
of
his
not
to
dispute
with
the
first
person
you
meet
but
only
with
those
of
your
acquaintance
of
whom
you
know
that
they
possess
sufficient
intelligence
and
not
to
advance
absurdities
to
appeal
to
reason
and
not
to
authority
and
to
listen
to
reason
and
yield
to
it
and
finally
to
cherish
truth
to
be
willing
to
accept
reason
even
from
an
opponent
and
to
be
just
enough
to
bear
being
proved
to
be
in
the
wrong
should
truth
lie
with
him
from
this
it
follows
that
scarcely
one
man
in
a
hundred
is
worth
your
disputing
with
him

remember
also
an
arabian
proverb
which
tells
us
that
the
tree
of
silence
there
hangs
its
fruit
which
is
on
the
comparative
place
of
interest
and
beauty
in
works
of
art
in
the
productions
of
poetic
genius
especially
of
the
epic
and
dramatic
kind
there
is
apart
from
beauty
another
quality
which
is
attractive
i
mean
interest
the
beauty
of
a
work
of
art
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
holds
up
a
clear
mirror
to
certain
inherent
in
the
world
in
general
the
beauty
of
a
work
of
poetic
art
in
particular
is
that
it
renders
the
ideas
inherent
in
mankind
and
thereby
leads
it
to
a
knowledge
of
these
ideas
the
means
which
poetry
uses
for
this
end
are
the
exhibition
of
significant
characters
and
the
invention
of
circumstances
which
will
bring
about
significant
situations
giving
occasion
to
the
characters
to
unfold
their
peculiarities
and
show
what
is
in
them
so
that
by
some
such
representation
a
clearer
and
fuller
knowledge
of
the
idea
of
humanity
may
be
attained
beauty
however
in
its
general
aspect
is
the
inseparable
characteristic
of
the
idea
when
it
has
become
known
in
other
words
everything
is
beautiful
in
which
an
idea
is
revealed
for
to
be
beautiful
means
no
more
than
clearly
to
express
an
idea
thus
we
perceive
that
beauty
is
always
an
affair
of
and
that
it
appeals
to
knowing
and
not
to
nay
it
is
a
fact
that
the
apprehension
of
beauty
on
the
part
of
the
subject
involves
a
complete
suppression
of
the
will
on
the
other
hand
we
call
drama
or
descriptive
poetry
interesting
when
it
represents
events
and
actions
of
a
kind
which
necessarily
arouse
concern
or
sympathy
like
that
which
we
feel
in
real
events
involving
our
own
person
the
fate
of
the
person
represented
in
them
is
felt
in
just
the
same
fashion
as
our
own
we
await
the
development
of
events
with
anxiety
we
eagerly
follow
their
course
our
hearts
quicken
when
the
hero
is
threatened
our
pulse
falters
as
the
danger
reaches
its
acme
and
throbs
again
when
he
is
suddenly
rescued
until
we
reach
the
end
of
the
story
we
can
not
put
the
book
aside
we
lie
away
far
into
the
night
sympathising
with
our
hero
troubles
as
though
they
were
our
own
nay
instead
of
finding
pleasure
and
recreation
in
such
representations
we
should
feel
all
the
pain
which
real
life
often
inflicts
upon
us
or
at
least
the
kind
which
pursues
us
in
our
uneasy
dreams
if
in
the
act
of
reading
or
looking
at
the
stage
we
had
not
the
firm
ground
of
reality
always
beneath
our
feet
as
it
is
in
the
stress
of
a
too
violent
feeling
we
can
find
relief
from
the
illusion
of
the
moment
and
then
give
way
to
it
again
at
will
moreover
we
can
gain
this
relief
without
any
such
violent
transition
as
occurs
in
a
dream
when
we
rid
ourselves
of
its
terrors
only
by
the
act
of
awaking
it
is
obvious
that
what
is
affected
by
poetry
of
this
character
is
our
and
not
merely
our
intellectual
powers
pure
and
simple
the
word
means
therefore
that
which
arouses
the
concern
of
the
individual
will
nostr√¢
and
here
it
is
that
beauty
is
clearly
distinguished
from
interest
the
one
is
an
affair
of
the
intellect
and
that
too
of
the
purest
and
simplest
kind
the
other
works
upon
the
will
beauty
then
consists
in
an
apprehension
of
ideas
and
knowledge
of
this
character
is
beyond
the
range
of
the
principle
that
nothing
happens
without
a
cause
interest
on
the
other
hand
has
its
origin
nowhere
but
in
the
course
of
events
that
is
to
say
in
the
complexities
which
are
possible
only
through
the
action
of
this
principle
in
its
different
forms
we
have
now
obtained
a
clear
conception
of
the
essential
difference
between
the
beauty
and
the
interest
of
a
work
of
art
we
have
recognised
that
beauty
is
the
true
end
of
every
art
and
therefore
also
of
the
poetic
art
it
now
remains
to
raise
the
question
whether
the
interest
of
a
work
of
art
is
a
second
end
or
a
means
to
the
exhibition
of
its
beauty
or
whether
the
interest
of
it
is
produced
by
its
beauty
as
an
essential
concomitant
and
comes
of
itself
as
soon
as
it
is
beautiful
or
whether
interest
is
at
any
rate
compatible
with
the
main
end
of
art
or
finally
whether
it
is
a
hindrance
to
it
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
interest
of
a
work
of
art
is
confined
to
works
of
poetic
art
it
does
not
exist
in
the
case
of
fine
art
or
of
music
or
architecture
nay
with
these
forms
of
art
it
is
not
even
conceivable
unless
indeed
the
interest
be
of
an
entirely
personal
character
and
confined
to
one
or
two
spectators
as
for
example
where
a
picture
is
a
portrait
of
some
one
whom
we
love
or
hate
the
building
my
house
or
my
prison
the
music
my
wedding
dance
or
the
tune
to
which
i
marched
to
the
war
interest
of
this
kind
is
clearly
quite
foreign
to
the
essence
and
purpose
of
art
it
disturbs
our
judgment
in
so
far
as
it
makes
the
purely
artistic
attitude
impossible
it
may
be
indeed
that
to
a
smaller
extent
this
is
true
of
all
interest
now
since
the
interest
of
a
work
of
art
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
have
the
same
kind
of
sympathy
with
a
poetic
representation
as
with
reality
it
is
obvious
that
the
representation
must
deceive
us
for
the
moment
and
this
it
can
do
only
by
its
truth
but
truth
is
an
element
in
perfect
art
a
picture
a
poem
should
be
as
true
as
nature
itself
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
lay
stress
on
whatever
forms
the
unique
character
of
its
subject
by
drawing
out
all
its
essential
manifestations
and
by
rejecting
everything
that
is
unessential
and
accidental
the
picture
or
the
poem
will
thus
emphasize
its
and
give
us
that
which
is
superior
to
nature
then
forms
the
point
that
is
common
both
to
interest
and
beauty
in
a
work
of
art
as
it
is
its
truth
which
produces
the
illusion
the
fact
that
the
truth
of
which
i
speak
is
might
indeed
be
detrimental
to
the
illusion
since
it
is
just
here
that
we
have
the
general
difference
between
poetry
and
reality
art
and
nature
but
since
it
is
possible
for
reality
to
coincide
with
the
ideal
it
is
not
actually
necessary
that
this
difference
should
destroy
the
illusion
in
the
case
of
fine
arts
there
is
in
the
range
of
the
means
which
art
adopts
a
certain
limit
and
beyond
it
illusion
is
impossible
sculpture
that
is
to
say
gives
us
mere
colourless
form
its
figures
are
without
eyes
and
without
movement
and
painting
provides
us
with
no
more
than
a
single
view
enclosed
within
strict
limits
which
separate
the
picture
from
the
adjacent
reality
here
then
there
is
no
room
for
illusion
and
consequently
none
for
that
interest
or
sympathy
which
resembles
the
interest
we
have
in
reality
the
will
is
at
once
excluded
and
the
object
alone
is
presented
to
us
in
a
manner
that
frees
it
from
any
personal
concern
it
is
a
highly
remarkable
fact
that
a
spurious
kind
of
fine
art
oversteps
these
limits
produces
an
illusion
of
reality
and
arouses
our
interest
but
at
the
same
time
it
destroys
the
effect
which
fine
art
produces
and
serves
as
nothing
but
a
mere
means
of
exhibiting
the
beautiful
that
is
of
communicating
a
knowledge
of
the
ideas
which
it
embodies
i
refer
to
here
we
might
say
is
the
dividing
line
which
separates
it
from
the
province
of
fine
art
when
waxwork
is
properly
executed
it
produces
a
perfect
illusion
but
for
that
very
reason
we
approach
a
wax
figure
as
we
approach
a
real
man
who
as
such
is
for
the
moment
an
object
presented
to
our
will
that
is
to
say
he
is
an
object
of
interest
he
arouses
the
will
and
consequently
stills
the
intellect
we
come
up
to
a
wax
figure
with
the
same
reserve
and
caution
as
a
real
man
would
inspire
in
us
our
will
is
excited
it
waits
to
see
whether
he
is
going
to
be
friendly
to
us
or
the
reverse
fly
from
us
or
attack
us
in
a
word
it
expects
some
action
of
him
but
as
the
figure
nevertheless
shows
no
sign
of
life
it
produces
the
impression
which
is
so
very
disagreeable
namely
of
a
corpse
this
is
a
case
where
the
interest
is
of
the
most
complete
kind
and
yet
where
there
is
no
work
of
art
at
all
in
other
words
interest
is
not
in
itself
a
real
end
of
art
the
same
truth
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
even
in
poetry
it
is
only
the
dramatic
and
descriptive
kind
to
which
interest
attaches
for
if
interest
were
with
beauty
the
aim
of
art
poetry
of
the
lyrical
kind
would
for
that
very
reason
not
take
half
so
great
a
position
as
the
other
two
in
the
second
place
if
interest
were
a
means
in
the
production
of
beauty
every
interesting
work
would
also
be
beautiful
that
however
is
by
no
means
the
case
a
drama
or
a
novel
may
often
attract
us
by
its
interest
and
yet
be
so
utterly
deficient
in
any
kind
of
beauty
that
we
are
afterwards
ashamed
of
having
wasted
our
time
on
it
this
applies
to
many
a
drama
which
gives
no
true
picture
of
the
real
life
of
man
which
contains
characters
very
superficially
drawn
or
so
distorted
as
to
be
actual
monstrosities
such
as
are
not
to
be
found
in
nature
but
the
course
of
events
and
the
play
of
the
action
are
so
intricate
and
we
feel
so
much
for
the
hero
in
the
situation
in
which
he
is
placed
that
we
are
not
content
until
we
see
the
knot
untangled
and
the
hero
rescued
the
action
is
so
cleverly
governed
and
guided
in
its
course
that
we
remain
in
a
state
of
constant
curiosity
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
and
we
are
utterly
unable
to
form
a
guess
so
that
between
eagerness
and
surprise
our
interest
is
kept
active
and
as
we
are
pleasantly
entertained
we
do
not
notice
the
lapse
of
time
most
of
kotzebue
plays
are
of
this
character
for
the
mob
this
is
the
right
thing
it
looks
for
amusement
something
to
pass
the
time
not
for
intellectual
perception
beauty
is
an
affair
of
such
perception
hence
sensibility
to
beauty
varies
as
much
as
the
intellectual
faculties
themselves
for
the
inner
truth
of
a
representation
and
its
correspondence
with
the
real
nature
of
humanity
the
mob
has
no
sense
at
all
what
is
flat
and
superficial
it
can
grasp
but
the
depths
of
human
nature
are
opened
to
it
in
vain
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
dramatic
representations
which
depend
for
their
value
on
their
interest
lose
by
repetition
because
they
are
no
longer
able
to
arouse
curiosity
as
to
their
course
since
it
is
already
known
to
see
them
often
makes
them
stale
and
tedious
on
the
other
hand
works
of
which
the
value
lies
in
their
beauty
gain
by
repetition
as
they
are
then
more
and
more
understood
most
novels
are
on
the
same
footing
as
dramatic
representations
of
this
character
they
are
creatures
of
the
same
sort
of
imagination
as
we
see
in
the
of
venice
and
naples
who
lays
a
hat
on
the
ground
and
waits
until
an
audience
is
assembled
then
he
spins
a
tale
which
so
captivates
his
hearers
that
when
he
gets
to
the
catastrophe
he
makes
a
round
of
the
crowd
hat
in
hand
for
contributions
without
the
least
fear
that
his
hearers
will
slip
away
similar
ply
their
trade
in
this
country
though
in
a
less
direct
fashion
they
do
it
through
the
agency
of
publishers
and
circulating
libraries
thus
they
can
avoid
going
about
in
rags
like
their
colleagues
elsewhere
they
can
offer
the
children
of
their
imagination
to
the
public
under
the
title
of
novels
short
stories
romantic
poems
fairy
tales
and
so
on
and
the
public
in
a
by
the
fireside
sits
down
more
at
its
ease
but
also
with
a
greater
amount
of
patience
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
interest
which
they
provide
how
very
little
aesthetic
value
there
generally
is
in
productions
of
this
sort
is
well
known
and
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
many
of
them
are
interesting
or
else
how
could
they
be
so
popular
we
see
then
in
reply
to
our
second
question
that
interest
does
not
necessarily
involve
beauty
and
conversely
it
is
true
that
beauty
does
not
necessarily
involve
interest
significant
characters
may
be
represented
that
open
up
the
depths
of
human
nature
and
it
may
all
be
expressed
in
actions
and
sufferings
of
an
exceptional
kind
so
that
the
real
nature
of
humanity
and
the
world
may
stand
forth
in
the
picture
in
the
clearest
and
most
forcible
lines
and
yet
no
high
degree
of
interest
may
be
excited
in
the
course
of
events
by
the
continued
progress
of
the
action
or
by
the
complexity
and
unexpected
solution
of
the
plot
the
immortal
masterpieces
of
shakespeare
contain
little
that
excites
interest
the
action
does
not
go
forward
in
one
straight
line
but
falters
as
in
all
through
the
play
or
else
it
spreads
out
in
breadth
as
in
merchant
of
whereas
length
is
the
proper
dimension
of
interest
or
the
scenes
hang
loosely
together
as
in
thus
it
is
that
dramas
produce
no
appreciable
effect
on
the
mob
the
dramatic
requirement
stated
by
aristotle
and
more
particularly
the
unity
of
action
have
in
view
the
interest
of
the
piece
rather
than
its
artistic
beauty
it
may
be
said
generally
that
these
requirements
are
drawn
up
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
to
which
i
have
referred
above
we
know
however
that
the
and
consequently
the
beauty
of
a
work
of
art
exist
only
for
the
perceptive
intelligence
which
has
freed
itself
from
the
domination
of
that
principle
it
is
just
here
that
we
find
the
distinction
between
interest
and
beauty
as
it
is
obvious
that
interest
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
mental
attitude
which
is
governed
by
the
principle
whereas
beauty
is
always
beyond
its
range
the
best
and
most
striking
refutation
of
the
aristotelian
unities
is
manzoni
it
may
be
found
in
the
preface
to
his
dramas
what
is
true
of
shakespeare
dramatic
works
is
true
also
of
goethe
even
makes
little
effect
on
the
public
because
it
contains
scarcely
any
complication
or
development
and
if
fails
what
are
we
to
say
of
or
that
the
greek
tragedians
did
not
look
to
interest
as
a
means
of
working
upon
the
public
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
the
material
of
their
masterpieces
was
almost
always
known
to
every
one
they
selected
events
which
had
often
been
treated
dramatically
before
this
shows
us
how
sensitive
was
the
greek
public
to
the
beautiful
as
it
did
not
require
the
interest
of
unexpected
events
and
new
stories
to
season
its
enjoyment
neither
does
the
quality
of
interest
often
attach
to
masterpieces
of
descriptive
poetry
father
homer
lays
the
world
and
humanity
before
us
in
its
true
nature
but
he
takes
no
trouble
to
attract
our
sympathy
by
a
complexity
of
circumstance
or
to
surprise
us
by
unexpected
entanglements
his
pace
is
lingering
he
stops
at
every
scene
he
puts
one
picture
after
another
tranquilly
before
us
elaborating
it
with
care
we
experience
no
passionate
emotion
in
reading
him
our
demeanour
is
one
of
pure
perceptive
intelligence
he
does
not
arouse
our
will
but
sings
it
to
rest
and
it
costs
us
no
effort
to
break
off
in
our
reading
for
we
are
not
in
condition
of
eager
curiosity
this
is
all
still
more
true
of
dante
whose
work
is
not
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
an
epic
but
a
descriptive
poem
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
the
four
immortal
romances
quixote
tristram
shandy
la
nouvelle
and
to
arouse
our
interest
is
by
no
means
the
chief
aim
of
these
works
in
the
hero
even
at
the
end
of
the
book
is
only
eight
years
of
age
on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
venture
to
assert
that
the
quality
of
interest
is
not
to
be
found
in
masterpieces
of
literature
we
have
it
in
schiller
dramas
in
an
appreciable
degree
and
consequently
they
are
popular
also
in
the
of
sophocles
amongst
masterpieces
of
description
we
find
it
in
ariosto
nay
an
example
of
a
high
degree
of
interest
bound
up
with
the
beautiful
is
afforded
in
an
excellent
novel
by
walter
scott
heart
of
this
is
the
most
interesting
work
of
fiction
that
i
know
where
all
the
effects
due
to
interest
as
i
have
given
them
generally
in
the
preceding
remarks
may
be
most
clearly
observed
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
very
beautiful
romance
throughout
it
shows
the
most
varied
pictures
of
life
drawn
with
striking
truth
and
it
exhibits
highly
different
characters
with
great
justice
and
fidelity
interest
then
is
certainly
compatible
with
beauty
that
was
our
third
question
nevertheless
a
comparatively
small
admixture
of
the
element
of
interest
may
well
be
found
to
be
most
advantageous
as
far
as
beauty
is
concerned
for
beauty
is
and
remains
the
end
of
art
beauty
is
in
twofold
opposition
with
interest
firstly
because
it
lies
in
the
perception
of
the
idea
and
such
perception
takes
its
object
entirely
out
of
the
range
of
the
forms
enunciated
by
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
whereas
interest
has
its
sphere
mainly
in
circumstance
and
it
is
out
of
this
principle
that
the
complexity
of
circumstance
arises
secondly
interest
works
by
exciting
the
will
whereas
beauty
exists
only
for
the
pure
perceptive
intelligence
which
has
no
will
however
with
dramatic
and
descriptive
literature
an
admixture
of
interest
is
necessary
just
as
a
volatile
and
gaseous
substance
requires
a
material
basis
if
it
is
to
be
preserved
and
transferred
the
admixture
is
necessary
partly
indeed
because
interest
is
itself
created
by
the
events
which
have
to
be
devised
in
order
to
set
the
characters
in
motion
partly
because
our
minds
would
be
weary
of
watching
scene
after
scene
if
they
had
no
concern
for
us
or
of
passing
from
one
significant
picture
to
another
if
we
were
not
drawn
on
by
some
secret
thread
it
is
this
that
we
call
interest
it
is
the
sympathy
which
the
event
in
itself
forces
us
to
feel
and
which
by
riveting
our
attention
makes
the
mind
obedient
to
the
poet
and
able
to
follow
him
into
all
the
parts
of
his
story
if
the
interest
of
a
work
of
art
is
sufficient
to
achieve
this
result
it
does
all
that
can
be
required
of
it
for
its
only
service
is
to
connect
the
pictures
by
which
the
poet
desires
to
communicate
a
knowledge
of
the
idea
as
if
they
were
pearls
and
interest
were
the
thread
that
holds
them
together
and
makes
an
ornament
out
of
the
whole
but
interest
is
prejudicial
to
beauty
as
soon
as
it
oversteps
this
limit
and
this
is
the
case
if
we
are
so
led
away
by
the
interest
of
a
work
that
whenever
we
come
to
any
detailed
description
in
a
novel
or
any
lengthy
reflection
on
the
part
of
a
character
in
a
drama
we
grow
impatient
and
want
to
put
spurs
to
our
author
so
that
we
may
follow
the
development
of
events
with
greater
speed
epic
and
dramatic
writings
where
beauty
and
interest
are
both
present
in
a
high
degree
may
be
compared
to
the
working
of
a
watch
where
interest
is
the
spring
which
keeps
all
the
wheels
in
motion
if
it
worked
unhindered
the
watch
would
run
down
in
a
few
minutes
beauty
holding
us
in
the
spell
of
description
and
reflection
is
like
the
barrel
which
checks
its
movement
or
we
may
say
that
interest
is
the
body
of
a
poetic
work
and
beauty
the
soul
in
the
epic
and
the
drama
interest
as
a
necessary
quality
of
the
action
is
the
matter
and
beauty
the
form
that
requires
the
matter
in
order
to
be
visible
psychological
observations
in
the
moment
when
a
great
affliction
overtakes
us
we
are
hurt
to
find
that
the
world
about
us
is
unconcerned
and
goes
its
own
way
as
goethe
says
in
how
easily
it
leaves
us
helpless
and
alone
and
continues
its
course
like
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
other
gods
die
welt
wie
sie
so
leicht
uns
h√ºlflos
einsam
l√§sst
und
ihren
weg
wie
sonn
und
mond
und
andre
g√∂tter
nay
more
it
is
something
intolerable
that
even
we
ourselves
have
to
go
on
with
the
mechanical
round
of
our
daily
business
and
that
thousands
of
our
own
actions
are
and
must
be
unaffected
by
the
pain
that
throbs
within
us
and
so
to
restore
the
harmony
between
our
outward
doings
and
our
inward
feelings
we
storm
and
shout
and
tear
our
hair
and
stamp
with
pain
or
rage
our
temperament
is
so
that
we
are
not
satisfied
unless
we
draw
everything
into
our
own
life
and
force
all
the
world
to
sympathise
with
us
the
only
way
of
achieving
this
would
be
to
win
the
love
of
others
so
that
the
afflictions
which
oppress
our
own
hearts
might
oppress
theirs
as
well
since
that
is
attended
with
some
difficulty
we
often
choose
the
shorter
way
and
blab
out
our
burden
of
woe
to
people
who
do
not
care
and
listen
with
curiosity
but
without
sympathy
and
much
oftener
with
satisfaction
speech
and
the
communication
of
thought
which
in
their
mutual
relations
are
always
attended
by
a
slight
impulse
on
the
part
of
the
will
are
almost
a
physical
necessity
sometimes
however
the
lower
animals
entertain
me
much
more
than
the
average
man
for
in
the
first
place
what
can
such
a
man
say
it
is
only
conceptions
that
is
the
driest
of
ideas
that
can
be
communicated
by
means
of
words
and
what
sort
of
conceptions
has
the
average
man
to
communicate
if
he
does
not
merely
tell
a
story
or
give
a
report
neither
of
which
makes
conversation
the
greatest
charm
of
conversation
is
the
mimetic
part
of
it
the
character
that
is
manifested
be
it
never
so
little
take
the
best
of
men
how
little
he
can
of
what
goes
on
within
him
since
it
is
only
conceptions
that
are
communicable
and
yet
a
conversation
with
a
clever
man
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
pleasures
it
is
not
only
that
ordinary
men
have
little
to
say
but
what
intellect
they
have
puts
them
in
the
way
of
concealing
and
distorting
it
and
it
is
the
necessity
of
practising
this
concealment
that
gives
them
such
a
pitiable
character
so
that
what
they
exhibit
is
not
even
the
little
that
they
have
but
a
mask
and
disguise
the
lower
animals
which
have
no
reason
can
conceal
nothing
they
are
altogether
and
therefore
very
entertaining
if
we
have
only
an
eye
for
the
kind
of
communications
which
they
make
they
speak
not
with
words
but
with
shape
and
structure
and
manner
of
life
and
the
things
they
set
about
they
express
themselves
to
an
intelligent
observer
in
a
very
pleasing
and
entertaining
fashion
it
is
a
varied
life
that
is
presented
to
him
and
one
that
in
its
manifestation
is
very
different
from
his
own
and
yet
essentially
it
is
the
same
he
sees
it
in
its
simple
form
when
reflection
is
excluded
for
with
the
lower
animals
life
is
lived
wholly
in
and
for
the
present
moment
it
is
the
present
that
the
animal
grasps
it
has
no
care
or
at
least
no
conscious
care
for
the
morrow
and
no
fear
of
death
and
so
it
is
wholly
taken
up
with
life
and
living
the
conversation
among
ordinary
people
when
it
does
not
relate
to
any
special
matter
of
fact
but
takes
a
more
general
character
mostly
consists
in
hackneyed
commonplaces
which
they
alternately
repeat
to
each
other
with
the
utmost
complacency
footnote
this
observation
is
in
schopenhauer
own
english
some
men
can
despise
any
blessing
as
soon
as
they
cease
to
possess
it
others
only
when
they
have
obtained
it
the
latter
are
the
more
unhappy
and
the
nobler
of
the
two
when
the
aching
heart
grieves
no
more
over
any
particular
object
but
is
oppressed
by
life
as
a
whole
it
withdraws
as
it
were
into
itself
there
is
here
a
retreat
and
gradual
extinction
of
the
will
whereby
the
body
which
is
the
manifestation
of
the
will
is
slowly
but
surely
undermined
and
the
individual
experiences
a
steady
dissolution
of
his
bonds
a
quiet
presentiment
of
death
hence
the
heart
which
aches
has
a
secret
joy
of
its
own
and
it
is
this
i
fancy
which
the
english
call
the
joy
of
grief
the
pain
that
extends
to
life
as
a
whole
and
loosens
our
hold
on
it
is
the
only
pain
that
is
really
that
which
attaches
to
particular
objects
is
a
will
that
is
broken
but
not
resigned
it
exhibits
the
struggle
and
inner
contradiction
of
the
will
and
of
life
itself
and
it
is
comic
be
it
never
so
violent
it
is
like
the
pain
of
the
miser
at
the
loss
of
his
hoard
even
though
pain
of
the
tragic
kind
proceeds
from
a
single
definite
object
it
does
not
remain
there
it
takes
the
separate
affliction
only
as
a
of
life
as
a
whole
and
transfers
it
thither
is
the
attitude
of
the
individual
as
intelligence
towards
the
check
imposed
upon
a
strong
manifestation
of
the
individual
as
will
there
are
two
ways
of
avoiding
it
either
by
repressing
the
violence
of
the
will
in
other
words
by
virtue
or
by
keeping
the
intelligence
from
dwelling
upon
the
check
in
other
words
by
stoicism
to
win
the
favour
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
by
one
personality
alone
is
perhaps
a
greater
satisfaction
to
one
vanity
than
to
anything
else
for
it
is
an
assurance
that
one
personality
is
an
equivalent
for
the
person
that
is
treasured
and
desired
and
defied
above
all
others
hence
it
is
that
despised
love
is
so
great
a
pang
especially
when
it
is
associated
with
jealousy
with
this
joy
and
this
pain
it
is
probable
that
vanity
is
more
largely
concerned
than
the
senses
because
it
is
only
the
things
of
the
mind
and
not
mere
sensuality
that
produce
such
violent
convulsions
the
lower
animals
are
familiar
with
lust
but
not
with
the
passionate
pleasures
and
pains
of
love
to
be
suddenly
placed
in
a
strange
town
or
country
where
the
manner
of
life
possibly
even
the
language
is
very
different
from
our
own
is
at
the
first
moment
like
stepping
into
cold
water
we
are
brought
into
sudden
contact
with
a
new
temperature
and
we
feel
a
powerful
and
superior
influence
from
without
which
affects
us
uncomfortably
we
find
ourselves
in
a
strange
element
where
we
can
not
move
with
ease
and
over
and
above
that
we
have
the
feeling
that
while
everything
strikes
us
as
strange
we
ourselves
strike
others
in
the
same
way
but
as
soon
as
we
are
a
little
composed
and
reconciled
to
our
surroundings
as
soon
as
we
have
appropriated
some
of
its
temperature
we
feel
an
extraordinary
sense
of
satisfaction
as
in
bathing
in
cool
water
we
assimilate
ourselves
to
the
new
element
and
cease
to
have
any
necessary
with
our
person
we
devote
our
attention
undisturbed
to
our
environment
to
which
we
now
feel
ourselves
superior
by
being
able
to
view
it
in
an
objective
and
disinterested
fashion
instead
of
being
oppressed
by
it
as
before
when
we
are
on
a
journey
and
all
kinds
of
remarkable
objects
press
themselves
on
our
attention
the
intellectual
food
which
we
receive
is
often
so
large
in
amount
that
we
have
no
time
for
digestion
and
we
regret
that
the
impressions
which
succeed
one
another
so
quickly
leave
no
permanent
trace
but
at
bottom
it
is
the
same
with
travelling
as
with
reading
how
often
do
we
complain
that
we
can
not
remember
one
thousandth
part
of
what
we
read
in
both
cases
however
we
may
console
ourselves
with
the
reflection
that
the
things
we
see
and
read
make
an
impression
on
the
mind
before
they
are
forgotten
and
so
contribute
to
its
formation
and
nurture
while
that
which
we
only
remember
does
no
more
than
stuff
it
and
puff
it
out
filling
up
its
hollows
with
matter
that
will
always
be
strange
to
it
and
leaving
it
in
itself
a
blank
it
is
the
very
many
and
varied
forms
in
which
human
life
is
presented
to
us
on
our
travels
that
make
them
entertaining
but
we
never
see
more
than
its
outside
such
as
is
everywhere
open
to
public
view
and
accessible
to
strangers
on
the
other
hand
human
life
on
its
inside
the
heart
and
centre
where
it
lives
and
moves
and
shows
its
character
and
in
particular
that
part
of
the
inner
side
which
could
be
seen
at
home
amongst
our
relatives
is
not
seen
we
have
exchanged
it
for
the
outer
side
this
is
why
on
our
travels
we
see
the
world
like
a
painted
landscape
with
a
very
wide
horizon
but
no
foreground
and
why
in
time
we
get
tired
of
it
one
man
is
more
concerned
with
the
impression
which
he
makes
upon
the
rest
of
mankind
another
with
the
impression
which
the
rest
of
mankind
makes
upon
him
the
disposition
of
the
one
is
subjective
of
the
other
objective
the
one
is
in
the
whole
of
his
existence
more
in
the
nature
of
an
idea
which
is
merely
presented
the
other
more
of
the
being
who
presents
it
a
woman
with
certain
exceptions
which
need
not
be
mentioned
will
not
take
the
first
step
with
a
man
for
in
spite
of
all
the
beauty
she
may
have
she
risks
a
refusal
a
man
may
be
ill
in
mind
or
body
or
busy
or
gloomy
and
so
not
care
for
advances
and
a
refusal
would
be
a
blow
to
her
vanity
but
as
soon
as
he
takes
the
first
step
and
helps
her
over
this
danger
he
stands
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
her
and
will
generally
find
her
quite
tractable
the
praise
with
which
many
men
speak
of
their
wives
is
really
given
to
their
own
judgment
in
selecting
them
this
arises
perhaps
from
a
feeling
of
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
a
man
shows
what
he
is
by
the
way
in
which
he
dies
and
by
the
choice
of
his
wife
if
education
or
warning
were
of
any
avail
how
could
seneca
pupil
be
a
nero
the
pythagorean
principle
that
is
known
only
by
is
in
many
respects
a
true
one
it
explains
how
it
is
that
every
man
understands
his
fellow
only
in
so
far
as
he
resembles
him
or
at
least
is
of
a
similar
character
what
one
man
is
quite
sure
of
perceiving
in
another
is
that
which
is
common
to
all
namely
the
vulgar
petty
or
mean
elements
of
our
nature
here
every
man
has
a
perfect
understanding
of
his
fellows
but
the
advantage
which
one
man
has
over
another
does
not
exist
for
the
other
who
be
the
talents
in
question
as
extraordinary
as
they
may
will
never
see
anything
beyond
what
he
possesses
himself
for
the
very
good
reason
that
this
is
all
he
wants
to
see
if
there
is
anything
on
which
he
is
in
doubt
it
will
give
him
a
vague
sense
of
fear
mixed
with
pique
because
it
passes
his
comprehension
and
therefore
is
uncongenial
to
him
footnote
see
porphyry
vita
this
is
why
it
is
mind
alone
that
understands
mind
why
works
of
genius
are
wholly
understood
and
valued
only
by
a
man
of
genius
and
why
it
must
necessarily
be
a
long
time
before
they
indirectly
attract
attention
at
the
hands
of
the
crowd
for
whom
they
will
never
in
any
true
sense
exist
this
too
is
why
one
man
will
look
another
in
the
face
with
the
impudent
assurance
that
he
will
never
see
anything
but
a
miserable
resemblance
of
himself
and
this
is
just
what
he
will
see
as
he
can
not
grasp
anything
beyond
it
hence
the
bold
way
in
which
one
man
will
contradict
another
finally
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
great
superiority
of
mind
isolates
a
man
and
that
those
of
high
gifts
keep
themselves
aloof
from
the
vulgar
and
that
means
every
one
for
if
they
mingle
with
the
crowd
they
can
communicate
only
such
parts
of
them
as
they
share
with
the
crowd
and
so
make
themselves
nay
even
though
they
possess
some
and
authoritative
reputation
amongst
the
crowd
they
are
not
long
in
losing
it
together
with
any
personal
weight
it
may
give
them
since
all
are
blind
to
the
qualities
on
which
it
is
based
but
have
their
eyes
open
to
anything
that
is
vulgar
and
common
to
themselves
they
soon
discover
the
truth
of
the
arabian
proverb
with
a
slave
and
he
show
you
his
it
also
follows
that
a
man
of
high
gifts
in
his
intercourse
with
others
must
always
reflect
that
the
best
part
of
him
is
out
of
sight
in
the
clouds
so
that
if
he
desires
to
know
accurately
how
much
he
can
be
to
any
one
else
he
has
only
to
consider
how
much
the
man
in
question
is
to
him
this
as
a
rule
is
precious
little
and
therefore
he
is
as
uncongenial
to
the
other
as
the
other
to
him
goethe
says
somewhere
that
man
is
not
without
a
vein
of
veneration
to
satisfy
this
impulse
to
venerate
even
in
those
who
have
no
sense
for
what
is
really
worthy
substitutes
are
provided
in
the
shape
of
princes
and
princely
families
nobles
titles
orders
and
vague
longing
and
boredom
are
close
akin
when
a
man
is
dead
we
envy
him
no
more
and
we
only
half
envy
him
when
he
is
old
misanthropy
and
love
of
solitude
are
convertible
ideas
in
chess
the
object
of
the
game
namely
to
checkmate
one
opponent
is
of
arbitrary
adoption
of
the
possible
means
of
attaining
it
there
is
a
great
number
and
according
as
we
make
a
prudent
use
of
them
we
arrive
at
our
goal
we
enter
on
the
game
of
our
own
choice
nor
is
it
otherwise
with
human
life
only
that
here
the
entrance
is
not
of
our
choosing
but
is
forced
on
us
and
the
object
which
is
to
live
and
exist
seems
indeed
at
times
as
though
it
were
of
arbitrary
adoption
and
that
we
could
if
necessary
relinquish
it
nevertheless
it
is
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
a
natural
object
that
is
to
say
we
can
not
relinquish
it
without
giving
up
existence
itself
if
we
regard
our
existence
as
the
work
of
some
arbitrary
power
outside
us
we
must
indeed
admire
the
cunning
by
which
that
creative
mind
has
succeeded
in
making
us
place
so
much
value
on
an
object
which
is
only
momentary
and
must
of
necessity
be
laid
aside
very
soon
and
which
we
see
moreover
on
reflection
to
be
altogether
vanity
in
making
i
say
this
object
so
dear
to
us
that
we
eagerly
exert
all
our
strength
in
working
at
it
although
we
knew
that
as
soon
as
the
game
is
over
the
object
will
exist
for
us
no
longer
and
that
on
the
whole
we
can
not
say
what
it
is
that
makes
it
so
attractive
nay
it
seems
to
be
an
object
as
arbitrarily
adopted
as
that
of
checkmating
our
king
and
nevertheless
we
are
always
intent
on
the
means
of
attaining
it
and
think
and
brood
over
nothing
else
it
is
clear
that
the
reason
of
it
is
that
our
intellect
is
only
capable
of
looking
outside
and
has
no
power
at
all
of
looking
within
and
since
this
is
so
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
on
the
wisdom
of
life
aphorisms
the
simple
philistine
believes
that
life
is
something
infinite
and
unconditioned
and
tries
to
look
upon
it
and
live
it
as
though
it
left
nothing
to
be
desired
by
method
and
principle
the
learned
philistine
does
the
same
he
believes
that
his
methods
and
his
principles
are
unconditionally
perfect
and
objectively
valid
so
that
as
soon
as
he
has
found
them
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
apply
them
to
circumstances
and
then
approve
or
condemn
but
happiness
and
truth
are
not
to
be
seized
in
this
fashion
it
is
phantoms
of
them
alone
that
are
sent
to
us
here
to
stir
us
to
action
the
average
man
pursues
the
shadow
of
happiness
with
unwearied
labour
and
the
thinker
the
shadow
of
truth
and
both
though
phantoms
are
all
they
have
possess
in
them
as
much
as
they
can
grasp
life
is
a
language
in
which
certain
truths
are
conveyed
to
us
could
we
learn
them
in
some
other
way
we
should
not
live
thus
it
is
that
wise
sayings
and
prudential
maxims
will
never
make
up
for
the
lack
of
experience
or
be
a
substitute
for
life
itself
still
they
are
not
to
be
despised
for
they
too
are
a
part
of
life
nay
they
should
be
highly
esteemed
and
regarded
as
the
loose
pages
which
others
have
copied
from
the
book
of
truth
as
it
is
imparted
by
the
spirit
of
the
world
but
they
are
pages
which
must
needs
be
imperfect
and
can
never
replace
the
real
living
voice
still
less
can
this
be
so
when
we
reflect
that
life
or
the
book
of
truth
speaks
differently
to
us
all
like
the
apostles
who
preached
at
pentecost
and
instructed
the
multitude
appearing
to
each
man
to
speak
in
his
own
tongue
recognise
the
truth
in
yourself
recognise
yourself
in
the
truth
and
in
the
same
moment
you
will
find
to
your
astonishment
that
the
home
which
you
have
long
been
looking
for
in
vain
which
has
filled
your
most
ardent
dreams
is
there
in
its
entirety
with
every
detail
of
it
true
in
the
very
place
where
you
stand
it
is
there
that
your
heaven
touches
your
earth
what
makes
us
almost
inevitably
ridiculous
is
our
serious
way
of
treating
the
passing
moment
as
though
it
necessarily
had
all
the
importance
which
it
seems
to
have
it
is
only
a
few
great
minds
that
are
above
this
weakness
and
instead
of
being
laughed
at
have
come
to
laugh
themselves
the
bright
and
good
moments
of
our
life
ought
to
teach
us
how
to
act
aright
when
we
are
melancholy
and
dull
and
stupid
by
preserving
the
memory
of
their
results
and
the
melancholy
dull
and
stupid
moments
should
teach
us
to
be
modest
when
we
are
bright
for
we
generally
value
ourselves
according
to
our
best
and
brightest
moments
and
those
in
which
we
are
weak
and
dull
and
miserable
we
regard
as
no
proper
part
of
us
to
remember
them
will
teach
us
to
be
modest
humble
and
tolerant
mark
my
words
once
for
all
my
dear
friend
and
be
clever
men
are
entirely
and
incapable
of
looking
at
things
objectively
if
you
had
a
dog
and
wanted
to
make
him
fond
of
you
and
fancied
that
of
your
hundred
rare
and
excellent
characteristics
the
mongrel
would
be
sure
to
perceive
one
and
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
make
him
devoted
to
you
body
and
soul
if
i
say
you
fancied
that
you
would
be
a
fool
pat
him
give
him
something
to
eat
and
for
the
rest
be
what
you
please
he
will
not
in
the
least
care
but
will
be
your
faithful
and
devoted
dog
now
believe
me
it
is
just
the
same
with
men
exactly
the
same
as
goethe
says
man
or
dog
it
is
a
miserable
wretch
ein

if
you
ask
why
these
contemptible
fellows
are
so
lucky
it
is
just
because
in
themselves
and
for
themselves
and
to
themselves
they
are
nothing
at
all
the
value
which
they
possess
is
merely
comparative
they
exist
only
for
others
they
are
never
more
than
means
they
are
never
an
end
and
object
in
themselves
they
are
mere
bait
set
to
catch
others
i
do
not
admit
that
this
rule
is
susceptible
of
any
exception
that
is
to
say
complete
exceptions
there
are
it
is
true
men
though
they
are
sufficiently
rare
who
enjoy
some
subjective
moments
nay
there
are
perhaps
some
who
for
every
hundred
subjective
moments
enjoy
a
few
that
are
objective
but
a
higher
state
of
perfection
scarcely
ever
occurs
but
do
not
take
yourself
for
an
exception
examine
your
love
your
friendship
and
consider
if
your
objective
judgments
are
not
mostly
subjective
judgments
in
disguise
consider
if
you
duly
recognise
the
good
qualities
of
a
man
who
is
not
fond
of
you
then
be
tolerant
confound
it
it
your
duty
as
you
are
all
so
recognise
your
own
weakness
you
know
that
you
can
not
like
a
man
who
does
not
show
himself
friendly
to
you
you
know
that
he
can
not
do
so
for
any
length
of
time
unless
he
likes
you
and
that
he
can
not
like
you
unless
you
show
that
you
are
friendly
to
him
then
do
it
your
false
friendliness
will
gradually
become
a
true
one
your
own
weakness
and
subjectivity
must
have
some
illusion
footnote
all
this
is
very
euphemistically
expressed
in
the
sophoclean
verse
greek
charin
gar
estin
ha
tiktous
this
is
really
an
justification
of
politeness
but
i
could
give
a
still
deeper
reason
for
it
consider
that
chance
which
with
error
its
brother
and
folly
its
aunt
and
malice
its
grandmother
rules
in
this
world
which
every
year
and
every
day
by
blows
great
and
small
embitters
the
life
of
every
son
of
earth
and
yours
too
consider
i
say
that
it
is
to
this
wicked
power
that
you
owe
your
prosperity
and
independence
for
it
gave
you
what
it
refused
to
many
thousands
just
to
be
able
to
give
it
to
individuals
like
you
remembering
all
this
you
will
not
behave
as
though
you
had
a
right
to
the
possession
of
its
gifts
but
you
will
perceive
what
a
capricious
mistress
it
is
that
gives
you
her
favours
and
therefore
when
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
deprive
you
of
some
or
all
of
them
you
will
not
make
a
great
fuss
about
her
injustice
but
you
will
recognise
that
what
chance
gave
chance
has
taken
away
if
needs
be
you
will
observe
that
this
power
is
not
quite
so
favourable
to
you
as
she
seemed
to
be
hitherto
why
she
might
have
disposed
not
only
of
what
she
gave
you
but
also
of
your
honest
and
gains
but
if
chance
still
remains
so
favourable
to
you
as
to
give
you
more
than
almost
all
others
whose
path
in
life
you
may
care
to
examine
oh
be
happy
do
not
struggle
for
the
possession
of
her
presents
employ
them
properly
look
upon
them
as
property
held
from
a
capricious
lord
use
them
wisely
and
well
the
aristotelian
principle
of
keeping
the
mean
in
all
things
is
ill
suited
to
the
moral
law
for
which
it
was
intended
but
it
may
easily
be
the
best
general
rule
of
worldly
wisdom
the
best
precept
for
a
happy
life
for
life
is
so
full
of
uncertainty
there
are
on
all
sides
so
many
discomforts
burdens
sufferings
dangers
that
a
safe
and
happy
voyage
can
be
accomplished
only
by
steering
carefully
through
the
rocks
as
a
rule
the
fear
of
the
ills
we
know
drive
us
into
the
contrary
ills
the
pain
of
solitude
for
example
drives
us
into
society
and
the
first
society
that
comes
the
discomforts
of
society
drive
us
into
solitude
we
exchange
a
forbidding
demeanour
for
incautious
confidence
and
so
on
it
is
ever
the
mark
of
folly
to
avoid
one
vice
by
rushing
into
its
contrary
dum
vitant
vitia
in
contraria
or
else
we
think
that
we
shall
find
satisfaction
in
something
and
spend
all
our
efforts
on
it
and
thereby
we
omit
to
provide
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
hundred
other
wishes
which
make
themselves
felt
at
their
own
time
one
loss
and
omission
follows
another
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
misery
greek
maeden
agan
and
are
therefore
excellent
rules
of
worldly
wisdom
we
often
find
that
people
of
great
experience
are
the
most
frank
and
cordial
in
their
intercourse
with
complete
strangers
in
whom
they
have
no
interest
whatever
the
reason
of
this
is
that
men
of
experience
know
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
people
who
stand
in
any
sort
of
mutual
relation
to
be
sincere
and
open
with
one
another
but
that
there
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
strain
between
them
due
to
the
fact
that
they
are
looking
after
their
own
interests
whether
immediate
or
remote
they
regret
the
fact
but
they
know
that
it
is
so
hence
they
leave
their
own
people
rush
into
the
arms
of
a
complete
stranger
and
in
happy
confidence
open
their
hearts
to
him
thus
it
is
that
monks
and
the
like
who
have
given
up
the
world
and
are
strangers
to
it
are
such
good
people
to
turn
to
for
advice
it
is
only
by
practising
mutual
restraint
and
that
we
can
act
and
talk
with
other
people
and
therefore
if
we
have
to
converse
at
all
it
can
only
be
with
a
feeling
of
resignation
for
if
we
seek
society
it
is
because
we
want
fresh
impressions
these
come
from
without
and
are
therefore
foreign
to
ourselves
if
a
man
fails
to
perceive
this
and
when
he
seeks
the
society
of
others
is
unwilling
to
practise
resignation
and
absolutely
refuses
to
deny
himself
nay
demands
that
others
who
are
altogether
different
from
himself
shall
nevertheless
be
just
what
he
wants
them
to
be
for
the
moment
according
to
the
degree
of
education
which
he
has
reached
or
according
to
his
intellectual
powers
or
his
mood
the
man
i
say
who
does
this
is
in
contradiction
with
himself
for
while
he
wants
some
one
who
shall
be
different
from
himself
and
wants
him
just
because
he
is
different
for
the
sake
of
society
and
fresh
influence
he
nevertheless
demands
that
this
other
individual
shall
precisely
resemble
the
imaginary
creature
who
accords
with
his
mood
and
have
no
thoughts
but
those
which
he
has
himself
women
are
very
liable
to
subjectivity
of
this
kind
but
men
are
not
free
from
it
either
i
observed
once
to
goethe
in
complaining
of
the
illusion
and
vanity
of
life
that
when
a
friend
is
with
us
we
do
not
think
the
same
of
him
as
when
he
is
away
he
replied
yes
because
the
absent
friend
is
yourself
and
he
exists
only
in
your
head
whereas
the
friend
who
is
present
has
an
individuality
of
his
own
and
moves
according
to
laws
of
his
own
which
can
not
always
be
in
accordance
with
those
which
you
form
for
yourself
a
good
supply
of
resignation
is
of
the
first
importance
in
providing
for
the
journey
of
life
it
is
a
supply
which
we
shall
have
to
extract
from
disappointed
hopes
and
the
sooner
we
do
it
the
better
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
how
should
a
man
be
content
so
long
as
he
fails
to
obtain
complete
unity
in
his
inmost
being
for
as
long
as
two
voices
alternately
speak
in
him
what
is
right
for
one
must
be
wrong
for
the
other
thus
he
is
always
complaining
but
has
any
man
ever
been
completely
at
one
with
himself
nay
is
not
the
very
thought
a
contradiction
that
a
man
shall
attain
this
inner
unity
is
the
impossible
and
inconsistent
pretension
put
forward
by
almost
all
philosophers
for
as
a
man
it
is
natural
to
him
to
be
at
war
with
himself
as
long
as
he
lives
while
he
can
be
only
one
thing
thoroughly
he
has
the
disposition
to
be
everything
else
and
the
inalienable
possibility
of
being
it
if
he
has
made
his
choice
of
one
thing
all
the
other
possibilities
are
always
open
to
him
and
are
constantly
claiming
to
be
realised
and
he
has
therefore
to
be
continuously
keeping
them
back
and
to
be
overpowering
and
killing
them
as
long
as
he
wants
to
be
that
one
thing
for
example
if
he
wants
to
think
only
and
not
act
and
do
business
the
disposition
to
the
latter
is
not
thereby
destroyed
all
at
once
but
as
long
as
the
thinker
lives
he
has
every
hour
to
keep
on
killing
the
acting
and
pushing
man
that
is
within
him
always
battling
with
himself
as
though
he
were
a
monster
whose
head
is
no
sooner
struck
off
than
it
grows
again
in
the
same
way
if
he
is
resolved
to
be
a
saint
he
must
kill
himself
so
far
as
he
is
a
being
that
enjoys
and
is
given
over
to
pleasure
for
such
he
remains
as
long
as
he
lives
it
is
not
once
for
all
that
he
must
kill
himself
he
must
keep
on
doing
it
all
his
life
if
he
has
resolved
upon
pleasure
whatever
be
the
way
in
which
it
is
to
be
obtained
his
lifelong
struggle
is
with
a
being
that
desires
to
be
pure
and
free
and
holy
for
the
disposition
remains
and
he
has
to
kill
it
every
hour
and
so
on
in
everything
with
infinite
modifications
it
is
now
one
side
of
him
and
now
the
other
that
conquers
he
himself
is
the
battlefield
if
one
side
of
him
is
continually
conquering
the
other
is
continually
struggling
for
its
life
is
bound
up
with
his
own
and
as
a
man
he
is
the
possibility
of
many
contradictions

conquered
as
well
as
the
conqueror
est
vivendi
the
clever
man
when
he
converses
will
think
less
of
what
he
is
saying
that
of
the
person
with
whom
he
is
speaking
for
then
he
is
sure
to
say
nothing
which
he
will
afterwards
regret
he
is
sure
not
to
lay
himself
open
nor
to
commit
an
indiscretion
but
his
conversation
will
never
be
particularly
interesting
an
intellectual
man
readily
does
the
opposite
and
with
him
the
person
with
whom
he
converses
is
often
no
more
than
the
mere
occasion
of
a
monologue
and
it
often
happens
that
the
other
then
makes
up
for
his
subordinate
by
lying
in
wait
for
the
man
of
intellect
and
drawing
his
secrets
out
of
him
nothing
betrays
less
knowledge
of
humanity
than
to
suppose
that
if
a
man
has
a
great
many
friends
it
is
a
proof
of
merit
and
intrinsic
value
as
though
men
gave
their
friendship
according
to
value
and
merit
as
though
they
were
not
rather
just
like
dogs
which
love
the
person
that
pats
them
and
gives
them
bits
of
meat
and
never
trouble
themselves
about
anything
else
the
man
who
understands
how
to
pat
his
fellows
best
though
they
be
the
nastiest
brutes
that
the
man
who
has
many
friends
it
is
the
converse
that
is
true
men
of
great
intellectual
worth
or
still
more
men
of
genius
can
have
only
very
few
friends
for
their
clear
eye
soon
discovers
all
defects
and
their
sense
of
rectitude
is
always
being
outraged
afresh
by
the
extent
and
the
horror
of
them
it
is
only
extreme
necessity
that
can
compel
such
men
not
to
betray
their
feelings
or
even
to
stroke
the
defects
as
if
they
were
beautiful
additions
personal
love
for
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
reverence
which
is
gained
by
authority
can
not
be
won
by
a
man
of
genius
unless
the
gods
have
endowed
him
with
an
indestructible
cheerfulness
of
temper
a
glance
that
makes
the
world
look
beautiful
or
unless
he
has
succeeded
by
degrees
in
taking
men
exactly
as
they
are
that
is
to
say
in
making
a
fool
of
the
fools
as
is
right
and
proper
on
the
heights
we
must
expect
to
be
solitary
our
constant
discontent
is
for
the
most
part
rooted
in
the
impulse
of
this
passes
into
a
kind
of
selfishness
and
makes
a
duty
out
of
the
maxim
that
we
should
always
fix
our
minds
upon
what
we
lack
so
that
we
may
endeavour
to
procure
it
thus
it
is
that
we
are
always
intent
on
finding
out
what
we
want
and
on
thinking
of
it
but
that
maxim
allows
us
to
overlook
undisturbed
the
things
which
we
already
possess
and
so
as
soon
as
we
have
obtained
anything
we
give
it
much
less
attention
than
before
we
seldom
think
of
what
we
have
but
always
of
what
we
lack
this
maxim
of
egoism
which
has
indeed
its
advantages
in
procuring
the
means
to
the
end
in
view
itself
concurrently
destroys
the
ultimate
end
namely
contentment
like
the
bear
in
the
fable
that
throws
a
stone
at
the
hermit
to
kill
the
fly
on
his
nose
we
ought
to
wait
until
need
and
privation
announce
themselves
instead
of
looking
for
them
minds
that
are
naturally
content
do
this
while
hypochondrists
do
the
reverse
a
man
nature
is
in
harmony
with
itself
when
he
desires
to
be
nothing
but
what
he
is
that
is
to
say
when
he
has
attained
by
experience
a
knowledge
of
his
strength
and
of
his
weakness
and
makes
use
of
the
one
and
conceals
the
other
instead
of
playing
with
false
coin
and
trying
to
show
a
strength
which
he
does
not
possess
it
is
a
harmony
which
produces
an
agreeable
and
rational
character
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
everything
which
makes
the
man
and
gives
him
his
mental
and
physical
qualities
is
nothing
but
the
manifestation
of
his
will
is
in
fact
what
he
therefore
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
inconsistencies
to
wish
to
be
other
than
we
are
people
of
a
strange
and
curious
temperament
can
be
happy
only
under
strange
circumstances
such
as
suit
their
nature
in
the
same
way
as
ordinary
circumstances
suit
the
ordinary
man
and
such
circumstances
can
arise
only
if
in
some
extraordinary
way
they
happen
to
meet
with
strange
people
of
a
character
different
indeed
but
still
exactly
suited
to
their
own
that
is
why
men
of
rare
or
strange
qualities
are
seldom
happy
all
this
pleasure
is
derived
from
the
use
and
consciousness
of
power
and
the
greatest
of
pains
that
a
man
can
feel
is
to
perceive
that
his
powers
fail
just
when
he
wants
to
use
them
therefore
it
will
be
advantageous
for
every
man
to
discover
what
powers
he
possesses
and
what
powers
he
lacks
let
him
then
develop
the
powers
in
which
he
is
and
make
a
strong
use
of
them
let
him
pursue
the
path
where
they
will
avail
him
and
even
though
he
has
to
conquer
his
inclinations
let
him
avoid
the
path
where
such
powers
are
requisite
as
he
possesses
only
in
a
low
degree
in
this
way
he
will
often
have
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
strength
and
seldom
a
painful
consciousness
of
weakness
and
it
will
go
well
with
him
but
if
he
lets
himself
be
drawn
into
efforts
demanding
a
kind
of
strength
quite
different
from
that
in
which
he
is
he
will
experience
humiliation
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
painful
feeling
with
which
a
man
can
be
afflicted
yet
there
are
two
sides
to
everything
the
man
who
has
insufficient
in
a
sphere
where
he
has
little
power
and
is
never
ready
to
make
a
venture
will
on
the
one
hand
not
even
learn
how
to
use
the
little
power
that
he
has
and
on
the
other
in
a
sphere
in
which
he
would
at
least
be
able
to
achieve
something
there
will
be
a
complete
absence
of
effort
and
consequently
of
pleasure
this
is
always
hard
to
bear
for
a
man
can
never
draw
a
complete
blank
in
any
department
of
human
welfare
without
feeling
some
pain
as
a
child
one
has
no
conception
of
the
inexorable
character
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
the
stubborn
way
in
which
everything
persists
in
remaining
what
it
is
the
child
believes
that
even
lifeless
things
are
disposed
to
yield
to
it
perhaps
because
it
feels
itself
one
with
nature
or
from
mere
unacquaintance
with
the
world
believes
that
nature
is
disposed
to
be
friendly
thus
it
was
that
when
i
was
a
child
and
had
thrown
my
shoe
into
a
large
vessel
full
of
milk
i
was
discovered
entreating
the
shoe
to
jump
out
nor
is
a
child
on
its
guard
against
animals
until
it
learns
that
they
are
and
spiteful
but
not
before
we
have
gained
mature
experience
do
we
recognise
that
human
character
is
unalterable
that
no
entreaty
or
representation
or
example
or
benefit
will
bring
a
man
to
give
up
his
ways
but
that
on
the
contrary
every
man
is
compelled
to
follow
his
own
mode
of
acting
and
thinking
with
the
necessity
of
a
law
of
nature
and
that
however
we
take
him
he
always
remains
the
same
it
is
only
after
we
have
obtained
a
clear
and
profound
knowledge
of
this
fact
that
we
give
up
trying
to
persuade
people
or
to
alter
them
and
bring
them
round
to
our
way
of
thinking
we
try
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
theirs
instead
so
far
as
they
are
indispensable
to
us
and
to
keep
away
from
them
so
far
as
we
can
not
possibly
agree
ultimately
we
come
to
perceive
that
even
in
matters
of
mere
intellect
although
its
laws
are
the
same
for
all
and
the
subject
as
opposed
to
the
object
of
thought
does
not
really
enter
into
individuality
there
is
nevertheless
no
certainty
that
the
whole
truth
of
any
matter
can
be
communicated
to
any
one
or
that
any
one
can
be
persuaded
or
compelled
to
assent
to
it
because
as
bacon
says
humanus
luminis
sicci
non
the
light
of
the
human
intellect
is
coloured
by
interest
and
passion
it
is
just
because
happiness
is
of
a
negative
that
when
we
succeed
in
being
perfectly
at
our
ease
we
are
not
properly
conscious
of
it
everything
seems
to
pass
us
softly
and
gently
and
hardly
to
touch
us
until
the
moment
is
over
and
then
it
is
the
positive
feeling
of
something
lacking
that
tells
us
of
the
happiness
which
has
vanished
it
is
then
that
we
observe
that
we
have
failed
to
hold
it
fast
and
we
suffer
the
pangs
of
as
well
as
of
privation
every
happiness
that
a
man
enjoys
and
almost
every
friendship
that
he
cherishes
rest
upon
illusion
for
as
a
rule
with
increase
of
knowledge
they
are
bound
to
vanish
nevertheless
here
as
elsewhere
a
man
should
courageously
pursue
truth
and
never
weary
of
striving
to
settle
accounts
with
himself
and
the
world
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
of
him
be
it
a
chimaera
or
fancy
that
makes
him
happy
let
him
take
heart
and
go
on
with
no
fear
of
the
desert
which
widens
to
his
view
of
one
thing
only
must
he
be
quite
certain
that
under
no
circumstances
will
he
discover
any
lack
of
worth
in
himself
when
the
veil
is
raised
the
sight
of
it
would
be
the
gorgon
that
would
kill
him
therefore
if
he
wants
to
remain
undeceived
let
him
in
his
inmost
being
feel
his
own
worth
for
to
feel
the
lack
of
it
is
not
merely
the
greatest
but
also
the
only
true
affliction
all
other
sufferings
of
the
mind
may
not
only
be
healed
but
may
be
immediately
relieved
by
the
secure
consciousness
of
worth
the
man
who
is
assured
of
it
can
sit
down
quietly
under
sufferings
that
would
otherwise
bring
him
to
despair
and
though
he
has
no
pleasures
no
joys
and
no
friends
he
can
rest
in
and
on
himself
so
powerful
is
the
comfort
to
be
derived
from
a
vivid
consciousness
of
this
advantage
a
comfort
to
be
preferred
to
every
other
earthly
blessing
contrarily
nothing
in
the
world
can
relieve
a
man
who
knows
his
own
worthlessness
all
that
he
can
do
is
to
conceal
it
by
deceiving
people
or
deafening
them
with
his
noise
but
neither
expedient
will
serve
him
very
long
we
must
always
try
to
preserve
large
views
if
we
are
arrested
by
details
we
shall
get
confused
and
see
things
awry
the
success
or
the
failure
of
the
moment
and
the
impression
that
they
make
should
count
for
nothing
footnote
schopenhauer
for
some
reason
that
is
not
apparent
wrote
this
remark
in
french
how
difficult
it
is
to
learn
to
understand
oneself
and
clearly
to
recognise
what
it
is
that
one
wants
before
anything
else
what
it
is
therefore
that
is
most
immediately
necessary
to
our
happiness
then
what
comes
next
and
what
takes
the
third
and
the
fourth
place
and
so
on
yet
without
this
knowledge
our
life
is
planless
like
a
captain
without
a
compass
the
sublime
melancholy
which
leads
us
to
cherish
a
lively
conviction
of
the
worthlessness
of
everything
of
all
pleasures
and
of
all
mankind
and
therefore
to
long
for
nothing
but
to
feel
that
life
is
merely
a
burden
which
must
be
borne
to
an
end
that
can
not
be
very
distant
is
a
much
happier
state
of
mind
than
any
condition
of
desire
which
be
it
never
so
cheerful
would
have
us
place
a
value
on
the
illusions
of
the
world
and
strive
to
attain
them
this
is
a
fact
which
we
learn
from
experience
and
it
is
clear
that
one
of
these
is
a
condition
of
illusion
and
the
other
of
knowledge
whether
it
is
better
to
marry
or
not
to
marry
is
a
question
which
in
very
many
cases
amounts
to
this
are
the
cares
of
love
more
endurable
than
the
anxieties
of
a
livelihood
marriage
is
a
trap
which
nature
sets
for
us
footnote
also
in
french
poets

incur
by

the
suspicion
that
they
are

to
their

and
not
to
the

of

habit

hence
to

to

the
two
chief
enemies

human
happiness
nature

our

we

ward
off
pain
which
is
more
often
of
the
mind
than
of
the
body

and
boredom
by
but
neither
of
these
is
akin
to
the
other
nay
in
any
high
degree
they
are
perhaps
incompatible
as
aristotle
remarks
genius
is
allied
to
melancholy
and
people
of
very
cheerful
disposition
are
only
intelligent
on
the
surface
the
better
therefore
anyone
is
by
nature
armed
against
one
of
these
evils
the
worse
as
a
rule
is
he
armed
against
the
other
there
is
no
human
life
that
is
free
from
pain
and
boredom
and
it
is
a
special
favour
on
the
part
of
fate
if
a
man
is
chiefly
exposed
to
the
evil
against
which
nature
has
armed
him
the
better
if
fate
that
is
sends
a
great
deal
of
pain
where
there
is
a
very
cheerful
temper
in
which
to
bear
it
and
much
leisure
where
there
is
much
intelligence
but
not
for
if
a
man
is
intelligent
he
feels
pain
doubly
or
trebly
and
a
cheerful
but
unintellectual
temper
finds
solitude
and
unoccupied
leisure
altogether
unendurable
in
the
sphere
of
thought
absurdity
and
perversity
remain
the
masters
of
this
world
and
their
dominion
is
suspended
only
for
brief
periods
nor
is
it
otherwise
in
art
for
there
genuine
work
seldom
found
and
still
more
seldom
appreciated
is
again
and
again
driven
out
by
dullness
insipidity
and
affectation
it
is
just
the

in
the
sphere
of
action
most
men
says
bias

bad
virtue
is
a
stranger
in

and
boundless
egoism
cunning

malice
are
always
the
order
of
the

it
is
wrong
to
deceive
the
young
on
this
point
for
it
will
only
make
them
feel
later
on
that
their
teachers
were
the

to
deceive
them
if
the
object
is
to
render
the
pupil
a
better
man
by
telling
him
that
others
are
excellent
it
fails
and
it
would
be
more

the
purpose

most
men
are
bad

shrewd
foresight
instead
of
having
to
be

by
bitter
experience
that
his
teachers
were
wrong
all
ignorance
is
dangerous
and
most
errors
must
be
dearly
paid

as
regards
his
ideas
and
the
opinions
which
he
forms
another
man
is
also
limited
though
not
in
the
same
way
but
should
he
succeed
in
comprehending
the
other
limitation
he
can
confuse
and
abash
him
and
put
him
to
shame
by
making
him
feel
what
his
limitation
is
even
though
the
other
be
far
and
away
his
superior
shrewd
people
often
employ
this
circumstance
to
obtain
a
false
and
momentary
advantage
the
only
genuine
superiority
is
that
of
the
mind
and
character
all
other
kinds
are
fictitious
affected
false
and
it
is
good
to
make
them
feel
that
it
is
so
when
they
try
to
show
off
before
the
superiority
that
is
true
footnote
in
the
original
this
also
is
in
french
the
world
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
exactly
independently
of
what
a
man
really
is
in
himself
he
has
a
part
to
play
which
fate
has
imposed
upon
him
from
without
by
determining
his
rank
education
and
circumstances
the
most
immediate
application
of
this
truth
appears
to
me
to
be
that
in
life
as
on
the
stage
we
must
distinguish
between
the
actor
and
his
part
distinguish
that
is
the
man
in
himself
from
his
position
and
reputation
from
the
part
which
rank
and
circumstances
have
imposed
upon
him
how
often
it
is
that
the
worst
actor
plays
the
king
and
the
best
the
beggar
this
may
happen
in
life
too
and
a
man
must
be
very
to
confuse
the
actor
with
his
part
our
life
is
so
poor
that
none
of
the
treasures
of
the
world
can
make
it
rich
for
the
sources
of
enjoyment
are
soon
found
to
be
all
very
scanty
and
it
is
in
vain
that
we
look
for
one
that
will
always
flow
therefore
as
regards
our
own
welfare
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
we
can
use
wealth
we
can
either
spend
it
in
ostentatious
pomp
and
feed
on
the
cheap
respect
which
our
imaginary
glory
will
bring
us
from
the
infatuated
crowd
or
by
avoiding
all
expenditure
that
will
do
us
no
good
we
can
let
our
wealth
grow
so
that
we
may
have
a
bulwark
against
misfortune
and
want
that
shall
be
stronger
and
better
every
day
in
view
of
the
fact
that
life
though
it
has
few
delights
is
rich
in
evils
it
is
just
because
our
real
and
inmost
being
is
that
it
is
only
by
its
exercise
that
we
can
attain
a
vivid
consciousness
of
existence
although
this
is
almost
always
attended
by
pain
hence
it
is
that
existence
is
essentially
painful
and
that
many
persons
for
whose
wants
full
provision
is
made
arrange
their
day
in
accordance
with
extremely
regular
monotonous
and
definite
habits
by
this
means
they
avoid
all
the
pain
which
the
movement
of
the
will
produces
but
on
the
other
hand
their
whole
existence
becomes
a
series
of
scenes
and
pictures
that
mean
nothing
they
are
hardly
aware
that
they
exist
nevertheless
it
is
the
best
way
of
settling
accounts
with
life
so
long
as
there
is
sufficient
change
to
prevent
an
excessive
feeling
of
boredom
it
is
much
better
still
if
the
muses
give
a
man
some
worthy
occupation
so
that
the
pictures
which
fill
his
consciousness
have
some
meaning
and
yet
not
a
meaning
that
can
be
brought
into
any
relation
with
his
will
a
man
is
only
on
condition
of
living
in
a
world
full
of
fools
genius
and
virtue
when
i
think
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
world
which
is
striving
to
express
its
thought
it
is
nature
which
is
trying
to
know
and
fathom
itself
it
is
not
the
thoughts
of
some
other
mind
which
i
am
endeavouring
to
trace
but
it
is
i
who
transform
that
which
exists
into
something
which
is
known
and
thought
and
would
otherwise
neither
come
into
being
nor
continue
in
it
in
the
realm
of
physics
it
was
held
for
thousands
of
years
to
be
a
fact
beyond
question
that
water
was
a
simple
and
consequently
an
original
element
in
the
same
way
in
the
realm
of
metaphysics
it
was
held
for
a
still
longer
period
that
the
was
a
simple
and
consequently
an
indestructible
entity
i
have
shown
however
that
it
is
composed
of
two
heterogeneous
parts
namely
the
which
is
metaphysical
in
its
character
a
thing
in
itself
and
the
which
is
physical
and
a
mere
phenomenon
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean
take
any
large
massive
heavy
building
this
hard
ponderous
body
that
fills
so
much
space
exists
i
tell
you
only
in
the
soft
pulp
of
the
brain
there
alone
in
the
human
brain
has
it
any
being
unless
you
understand
this
you
can
go
no
further
truly
it
is
the
world
itself
that
is
a
miracle
the
world
of
material
bodies
i
looked
at
two
of
them
both
were
heavy
symmetrical
and
beautiful
one
was
a
jasper
vase
with
golden
rim
and
golden
handles
the
other
was
an
organism
an
animal
a
man
when
i
had
sufficiently
admired
their
exterior
i
asked
my
attendant
genius
to
allow
me
to
examine
the
inside
of
them
and
i
did
so
in
the
vase
i
found
nothing
but
the
force
of
gravity
and
a
certain
obscure
desire
which
took
the
form
of
chemical
affinity
but
when
i
entered
into
the
other
how
shall
i
express
my
astonishment
at
what
i
saw
it
is
more
incredible
than
all
the
fairy
tales
and
fables
that
were
ever
conceived
nevertheless
i
shall
try
to
describe
it
even
at
the
risk
of
finding
no
credence
for
my
tale
in
this
second
thing
or
rather
in
the
upper
end
of
it
called
the
head
which
on
its
exterior
side
looks
like
anything
else
a
body
in
space
heavy
and
so
on
i
found
no
less
an
object
than
the
whole
world
itself
together
with
the
whole
of
the
space
in
which
all
of
it
exists
and
the
whole
of
the
time
in
which
all
of
it
moves
and
finally
everything
that
fills
both
time
and
space
in
all
its
variegated
and
infinite
character
nay
strangest
sight
of
all
i
found
myself
walking
about
in
it
it
was
no
picture
that
i
saw
it
was
no
but
reality
itself
this
it
is
that
is
really
and
truly
to
be
found
in
a
thing
which
is
no
bigger
than
a
cabbage
and
which
on
occasion
an
executioner
might
strike
off
at
a
blow
and
suddenly
smother
that
world
in
darkness
and
night
the
world
i
say
would
vanish
did
not
heads
grow
like
mushrooms
and
were
there
not
always
plenty
of
them
ready
to
snatch
it
up
as
it
is
sinking
down
into
nothing
and
keep
it
going
like
a
ball
this
world
is
an
idea
which
they
all
have
in
common
and
they
express
the
community
of
their
thought
by
the
word
objectivity
in
the
face
of
this
vision
i
felt
as
if
i
were
ardschuna
when
krishna
appeared
to
him
in
his
true
majesty
with
his
hundred
thousand
arms
and
eyes
and
mouths
when
i
see
a
wide
landscape
and
realise
that
it
arises
by
the
operation
of
the
functions
of
my
brain
that
is
to
say
of
time
space
and
casuality
on
certain
spots
which
have
gathered
on
my
retina
i
feel
that
i
carry
it
within
me
i
have
an
extraordinarily
clear
consciousness
of
the
identity
of
my
own
being
with
that
of
the
external
world
nothing
provides
so
vivid
an
illustration
of
this
identity
as
a
for
in
a
dream
other
people
appear
to
be
totally
distinct
from
us
and
to
possess
the
most
perfect
objectivity
and
a
nature
which
is
quite
different
from
ours
and
which
often
puzzles
surprises
astonishes
or
terrifies
us
and
yet
it
is
all
our
own
self
it
is
even
so
with
the
will
which
sustains
the
whole
of
the
external
world
and
gives
it
life
it
is
the
same
will
that
is
in
ourselves
and
it
is
there
alone
that
we
are
immediately
conscious
of
it
but
it
is
the
intellect
in
ourselves
and
in
others
which
makes
all
these
miracles
possible
for
it
is
the
intellect
which
everywhere
divides
actual
being
into
subject
and
object
it
is
a
hall
of
phantasmagorical
mystery
inexpressibly
marvellous
incomparably
magical
the
difference
in
degree
of
mental
power
which
sets
so
wide
a
gulf
between
the
genius
and
the
ordinary
mortal
rests
it
is
true
upon
nothing
else
than
a
more
or
less
perfect
development
of
the
cerebral
system
but
it
is
this
very
difference
which
is
so
important
because
the
whole
of
the
real
world
in
which
we
live
and
move
possesses
an
existence
only
in
relation
to
this
cerebral
system
accordingly
the
difference
between
a
genius
and
an
ordinary
man
is
a
total
diversity
of
world
and
existence
the
difference
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
may
be
similarly
explained
when
momus
was
said
to
ask
for
a
window
in
the
breast
it
was
an
allegorical
joke
and
we
can
not
even
imagine
such
a
contrivance
to
be
a
possibility
but
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
imagine
that
the
skull
and
its
integuments
were
transparent
and
then
good
heavens
what
differences
should
we
see
in
the
size
the
form
the
quality
the
movement
of
the
brain
what
degrees
of
value
a
great
mind
would
inspire
as
much
respect
at
first
sight
as
three
stars
on
a
breast
and
what
a
miserable
figure
would
be
cut
by
many
a
one
who
wore
them
men
of
genius
and
intellect
and
all
those
whose
mental
and
theoretical
qualities
are
far
more
developed
than
their
moral
and
practical
qualities
men
in
a
word
who
have
more
mind
than
character
are
often
not
only
awkward
and
ridiculous
in
matters
of
daily
life
as
has
been
observed
by
plato
in
the
seventh
book
of
the
and
portrayed
by
goethe
in
his
but
they
are
often
from
a
moral
point
of
view
weak
and
contemptible
creatures
as
well
nay
they
might
almost
be
called
bad
men
of
this
rousseau
has
given
us
genuine
examples
nevertheless
that
better
consciousness
which
is
the
source
of
all
virtue
is
often
stronger
in
them
than
in
many
of
those
whose
actions
are
nobler
than
their
thoughts
nay
it
may
be
said
that
those
who
think
nobly
have
a
better
acquaintance
with
virtue
while
the
others
make
a
better
practice
of
it
full
of
zeal
for
the
good
and
for
the
beautiful
they
would
fain
fly
up
to
heaven
in
a
straight
line
but
the
grosser
elements
of
this
earth
oppose
their
flight
and
they
sink
back
again
they
are
like
born
artists
who
have
no
knowledge
of
technique
or
find
that
the
marble
is
too
hard
for
their
fingers
many
a
man
who
has
much
less
enthusiasm
for
the
good
and
a
far
shallower
acquaintance
with
its
depths
makes
a
better
thing
of
it
in
practice
he
looks
down
upon
the
noble
thinkers
with
contempt
and
he
has
a
right
to
do
it
nevertheless
he
does
not
understand
them
and
they
despise
him
in
their
turn
and
not
unjustly
they
are
to
blame
for
every
living
man
has
by
the
fact
of
his
living
signed
the
conditions
of
life
but
they
are
still
more
to
be
pitied
they
achieve
their
redemption
not
on
the
way
of
virtue
but
on
a
path
of
their
own
and
they
are
saved
not
by
works
but
by
faith
men
of
no
genius
whatever
can
not
bear
solitude
they
take
no
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
and
the
world
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
never
lose
sight
of
their
own
will
and
therefore
they
see
nothing
of
the
objects
of
the
world
but
the
bearing
of
such
objects
upon
their
will
and
person
with
objects
which
have
no
such
bearing
there
sounds
within
them
a
constant
note
is
nothing
to
which
is
the
fundamental
base
in
all
their
music
thus
all
things
seem
to
them
to
wear
a
bleak
gloomy
strange
hostile
aspect
it
is
only
for
their
will
that
they
seem
to
have
any
perceptive
faculties
at
all
and
it
is
in
fact
only
a
moral
and
not
a
theoretical
tendency
only
a
moral
and
not
an
intellectual
value
that
their
life
possesses
the
lower
animals
bend
their
heads
to
the
ground
because
all
that
they
want
to
see
is
what
touches
their
welfare
and
they
can
never
come
to
contemplate
things
from
a
really
objective
point
of
view
it
is
very
seldom
that
unintellectual
men
make
a
true
use
of
their
erect
position
and
then
it
is
only
when
they
are
moved
by
some
intellectual
influence
outside
them
the
man
of
intellect
or
genius
on
the
other
hand
has
more
of
the
character
of
the
eternal
subject
that
knows
than
of
the
finite
subject
that
wills
his
knowledge
is
not
quite
engrossed
and
captivated
by
his
will
but
passes
beyond
it
he
is
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
it
is
not
only
a
moral
but
also
a
theoretical
tendency
that
is
evinced
in
his
life
nay
it
might
perhaps
be
said
that
to
a
certain
extent
he
is
beyond
morality
of
great
villainy
he
is
totally
incapable
and
his
conscience
is
less
oppressed
by
ordinary
sin
than
the
conscience
of
the
ordinary
man
because
life
as
it
were
is
a
game
and
he
sees
through
it
the
relation
between
and
is
determined
by
the
following
considerations
vice
is
an
impulse
of
the
will
so
violent
in
its
demands
that
it
affirms
its
own
life
by
denying
the
life
of
others
the
only
kind
of
knowledge
that
is
useful
to
the
will
is
the
knowledge
that
a
given
effect
is
produced
by
a
certain
cause
genius
itself
is
a
kind
of
knowledge
namely
of
ideas
and
it
is
a
knowledge
which
is
unconcerned
with
any
principle
of
causation
the
man
who
is
devoted
to
knowledge
of
this
character
is
not
employed
in
the
business
of
the
will
nay
every
man
who
is
devoted
to
the
purely
objective
contemplation
of
the
world
and
it
is
this
that
is
meant
by
the
knowledge
of
ideas
completely
loses
sight
of
his
will
and
its
objects
and
pays
no
further
regard
to
the
interests
of
his
own
person
but
becomes
a
pure
intelligence
free
of
any
admixture
of
will
where
then
devotion
to
the
intellect
predominates
over
concern
for
the
will
and
its
objects
it
shows
that
the
man
will
is
not
the
principal
element
in
his
being
but
that
in
proportion
to
his
intelligence
it
is
weak
violent
desire
which
is
the
root
of
all
vice
never
allows
a
man
to
arrive
at
the
pure
and
disinterested
contemplation
of
the
world
free
from
any
relation
to
the
will
such
as
constitutes
the
quality
of
genius
but
here
the
intelligence
remains
the
constant
slave
of
the
will
since
genius
consists
in
the
perception
of
ideas
and
men
of
genius
their
object
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
only
the
eye
which
is
any
real
evidence
of
genius
for
the
contemplative
gaze
has
something
steady
and
vivid
about
it
and
with
the
eye
of
genius
it
is
often
the
case
as
with
goethe
that
the
white
membrane
over
the
pupil
is
visible
with
violent
passionate
men
the
same
thing
may
also
happen
but
it
arises
from
a
different
cause
and
may
be
easily
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
the
eyes
roll
men
of
no
genius
at
all
have
no
interest
in
the
idea
expressed
by
an
object
but
only
in
the
relations
in
which
that
object
stands
to
others
and
finally
to
their
own
person
thus
it
is
that
they
never
indulge
in
contemplation
or
are
soon
done
with
it
and
rarely
fix
their
eyes
long
upon
any
object
and
so
their
eyes
do
not
wear
the
mark
of
genius
which
i
have
described
nay
the
regular
philistine
does
the
direct
opposite
of
contemplating
he
spies
if
he
looks
at
anything
it
is
to
pry
into
it
as
may
be
specially
observed
when
he
screws
up
his
eyes
which
he
frequently
does
in
order
to
see
the
clearer
certainly
no
real
man
of
genius
ever
does
this
at
least
habitually
even
though
he
is
what
i
have
said
will
sufficiently
illustrate
the
conflict
between
genius
and
vice
it
may
be
however
nay
it
is
often
the
case
that
genius
is
attended
by
a
strong
will
and
as
little
as
men
of
genius
were
ever
consummate
rascals
were
they
ever
perhaps
perfect
saints
either
let
me
explain
virtue
is
not
exactly
a
positive
weakness
of
the
will
it
is
rather
an
intentional
restraint
imposed
upon
its
violence
through
a
knowledge
of
it
in
its
inmost
being
as
manifested
in
the
world
this
knowledge
of
the
world
the
inmost
being
of
which
is
communicable
only
in
is
common
both
to
the
genius
and
to
the
saint
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
that
the
genius
reveals
his
knowledge
by
rendering
it
in
some
form
of
his
own
choice
and
the
product
is
art
for
this
the
saint
as
such
possesses
no
direct
faculty
he
makes
an
immediate
application
of
his
knowledge
to
his
own
will
which
is
thus
led
into
a
denial
of
the
world
with
the
saint
knowledge
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
whereas
the
genius
remains
at
the
stage
of
knowledge
and
has
his
pleasure
in
it
and
reveals
it
by
rendering
what
he
knows
in
his
art
in
the
hierarchy
of
physical
organisation
strength
of
will
is
attended
by
a
corresponding
growth
in
the
intelligent
faculties
a
high
degree
of
knowledge
such
as
exists
in
the
genius
presupposes
a
powerful
will
though
at
the
same
time
a
will
that
is
subordinate
to
the
intellect
in
other
words
both
the
intellect
and
the
will
are
strong
but
the
intellect
is
the
stronger
of
the
two
unless
as
happens
in
the
case
of
the
saint
the
intellect
is
at
once
applied
to
the
will
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
artist
it
finds
its
pleasures
in
a
reproduction
of
itself
the
will
remains
untamed
any
strength
that
it
may
lose
is
due
to
the
predominance
of
pure
objective
intelligence
which
is
concerned
with
the
contemplation
of
ideas
and
is
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
common
or
the
bad
man
wholly
occupied
with
the
objects
of
the
will
in
the
interval
when
the
genius
is
no
longer
engaged
in
the
contemplation
of
ideas
and
his
intelligence
is
again
applied
to
the
will
and
its
objects
the
will
is
in
all
its
strength
thus
it
is
that
men
of
genius
often
have
very
violent
desires
and
are
addicted
to
sensual
pleasure
and
to
anger
great
crimes
however
they
do
not
commit
because
when
the
opportunity
of
them
offers
they
recognise
their
idea
and
see
it
very
vividly
and
clearly
their
intelligence
is
thus
directed
to
the
idea
and
so
gains
the
predominance
over
the
will
and
turns
its
course
as
with
the
saint
and
the
crime
is
uncommitted
the
genius
then
always
participates
to
some
degree
in
the
characteristics
of
the
saint
as
he
is
a
man
of
the
same
qualification
and
contrarily
the
saint
always
participates
to
some
degree
in
the
characteristics
of
the
genius
the
character
which
is
common
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
saintly
by
the
fact
that
it
consists
in
a
weakness
of
will
with
a
somewhat
less
marked
weakness
of
intellect
a
lower
degree
of
the
knowledge
of
the
world
as
revealed
in
ideas
here
suffices
to
check
and
control
a
will
that
is
weak
in
itself
genius
and
sanctity
are
far
removed
from
which
is
essentially
weak
in
all
its
manifestations
apart
from
all
that
i
have
said
so
much
at
least
is
clear
what
appears
under
the
forms
of
time
space
and
casuality
and
vanishes
again
and
in
reality
is
nothing
and
reveals
its
nothingness
by
death
this
vicious
and
fatal
appearance
is
the
will
but
what
does
not
appear
and
is
no
phenomenon
but
rather
the
noumenon
what
makes
appearance
possible
what
is
not
subject
to
the
principle
of
causation
and
therefore
has
no
vain
or
vanishing
existence
but
abides
for
ever
unchanged
in
the
midst
of
a
world
full
of
suffering
like
a
ray
of
light
in
a
storm
free
therefore
from
all
pain
and
fatality
this
i
say
is
the
intelligence
the
man
who
is
more
intelligence
than
will
is
thereby
delivered
in
respect
of
the
greatest
part
of
him
from
nothingness
and
death
and
such
a
man
is
in
his
nature
a
genius
by
the
very
fact
that
he
lives
and
works
the
man
who
is
endowed
with
genius
makes
an
entire
sacrifice
of
himself
in
the
interests
of
everyone
accordingly
he
is
free
from
the
obligation
to
make
a
particular
sacrifice
for
individuals
and
thus
he
can
refuse
many
demands
which
others
are
rightly
required
to
meet
he
suffers
and
achieves
more
than
all
the
others
the
spring
which
moves
the
genius
to
elaborate
his
works
is
not
fame
for
that
is
too
uncertain
a
quality
and
when
it
is
seen
at
close
quarters
of
little
worth
no
amount
of
fame
will
make
up
for
the
labour
of
attaining
it
est
fama
tuum
par
oequiparare
nor
is
it
the
delight
that
a
man
has
in
his
work
for
that
too
is
outweighed
by
the
effort
which
he
has
to
make
it
is
rather
an
instinct
in
virtue
of
which
the
genius
is
driven
to
express
what
he
sees
and
feels
in
some
permanent
shape
without
being
conscious
of
any
further
motive
it
is
manifest
that
in
so
far
as
it
leads
an
individual
to
sacrifice
himself
for
his
species
and
to
live
more
in
the
species
than
in
himself
this
impulse
is
possessed
of
a
certain
resemblance
with
such
modifications
of
the
sexual
impulse
as
are
peculiar
to
man
the
modifications
to
which
i
refer
are
those
that
confine
this
impulse
to
certain
individuals
of
the
other
sex
whereby
the
interests
of
the
species
are
attained
the
individuals
who
are
actively
affected
by
this
impulse
may
be
said
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
species
by
their
passion
for
each
other
and
the
disadvantageous
conditions
thereby
imposed
upon
them
in
a
word
by
the
institution
of
marriage
they
may
be
said
to
be
serving
the
interests
of
the
species
rather
than
the
interests
of
the
individual
the
instinct
of
the
genius
does
in
a
higher
fashion
for
the
idea
what
passionate
love
does
for
the
will
in
both
cases
there
are
peculiar
pleasures
and
peculiar
pains
reserved
for
the
individuals
who
in
this
way
serve
the
interests
of
the
species
and
they
live
in
a
state
of
enhanced
power
the
genius
who
decides
once
for
all
to
live
for
the
interests
of
the
species
in
the
way
which
he
chooses
is
neither
fitted
nor
called
upon
to
do
it
in
the
other
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
perpetuation
of
a
man
name
is
effected
in
both
ways
in
music
the
finest
compositions
are
the
most
difficult
to
understand
they
are
only
for
the
trained
intelligence
they
consist
of
long
movements
where
it
is
only
after
a
labyrinthine
maze
that
the
fundamental
note
is
recovered
it
is
just
so
with
genius
it
is
only
after
a
course
of
struggle
and
doubt
and
error
and
much
reflection
and
vacillation
that
great
minds
attain
their
equilibrium
it
is
the
longest
pendulum
that
makes
the
greatest
swing
little
minds
soon
come
to
terms
with
themselves
and
the
world
and
then
fossilise
but
the
others
flourish
and
are
always
alive
and
in
motion
the
essence
of
genius
is
a
measure
of
intellectual
power
far
beyond
that
which
is
required
to
serve
the
individual
will
but
it
is
a
measure
of
a
merely
relative
character
and
it
may
be
reached
by
lowering
the
degree
of
the
will
as
well
as
by
raising
that
of
the
intellect
there
are
men
whose
intellect
predominates
over
their
will
and
are
yet
not
possessed
of
genius
in
any
proper
sense
their
intellectual
powers
do
indeed
exceed
the
ordinary
though
not
to
any
great
extent
but
their
will
is
weak
they
have
no
violent
desires
and
therefore
they
are
more
concerned
with
mere
knowledge
than
with
the
satisfaction
of
any
aims
such
men
possess
talent
they
are
intelligent
and
at
the
same
time
very
contented
and
cheerful
a
clear
cheerful
and
reasonable
mind
such
as
brings
a
man
happiness
is
dependent
on
the
relation
established
between
his
intellect
and
his
will
a
relation
in
which
the
intellect
is
predominant
but
genius
and
a
great
mind
depend
on
the
relation
between
a
man
intellect
and
that
of
other
people
a
relation
in
which
his
intellect
must
exceed
theirs
and
at
the
same
time
his
will
may
also
be
proportionately
stronger
that
is
the
reason
why
genius
and
happiness
need
not
necessarily
exist
together
when
the
individual
is
distraught
by
cares
or
pleasantry
or
tortured
by
the
violence
of
his
wishes
and
desires
the
genius
in
him
is
enchained
and
can
not
move
it
is
only
when
care
and
desire
are
silent
that
the
air
is
free
enough
for
genius
to
live
in
it
it
is
then
that
the
bonds
of
matter
are
cast
aside
and
the
pure
spirit
the
pure
knowing
subject
remains
hence
if
a
man
has
any
genius
let
him
guard
himself
from
pain
keep
care
at
a
distance
and
limit
his
desires
but
those
of
them
which
he
can
not
suppress
let
him
satisfy
to
the
full
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
he
will
make
the
best
use
of
his
rare
existence
to
his
own
pleasure
and
the
world
profit
to
fight
with
need
and
care
or
desires
the
satisfaction
of
which
is
refused
and
forbidden
is
good
enough
work
for
those
who
were
they
free
of
would
have
to
fight
with
boredom
and
so
take
to
bad
practices
but
not
for
the
man
whose
time
if
well
used
will
bear
fruit
for
centuries
to
come
as
diderot
says
he
is
not
merely
a
moral
being
mechanical
laws
do
not
apply
in
the
sphere
of
chemistry
nor
do
chemical
laws
in
the
sphere
in
which
organic
life
is
kindled
in
the
same
way
the
rules
which
avail
for
ordinary
men
will
not
do
for
the
exceptions
nor
will
their
pleasures
either
it
is
a
persistent
uninterrupted
activity
that
constitutes
the
superior
mind
the
object
to
which
this
activity
is
directed
is
a
matter
of
subordinate
importance
it
has
no
essential
bearing
on
the
superiority
in
question
but
only
on
the
individual
who
possesses
it
all
that
education
can
do
is
to
determine
the
direction
which
this
activity
shall
take
and
that
is
the
reason
why
a
man
nature
is
so
much
more
important
than
his
education
for
education
is
to
natural
faculty
what
a
wax
nose
is
to
a
real
one
or
what
the
moon
and
the
planets
are
to
the
sun
in
virtue
of
his
education
a
man
says
not
what
he
thinks
himself
but
what
others
have
thought
and
he
has
learned
as
a
matter
of
training
and
what
he
does
is
not
what
he
wants
but
what
he
has
been
accustomed
to
do
the
lower
animals
perform
many
intelligent
functions
much
better
than
man
for
instance
the
finding
of
their
way
back
to
the
place
from
which
they
came
the
recognition
of
individuals
and
so
on
in
the
same
way
there
are
many
occasions
in
real
life
to
which
the
genius
is
incomparably
less
equal
and
fitted
than
the
ordinary
man
nay
more
just
as
animals
never
commit
a
folly
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
so
the
average
man
is
not
exposed
to
folly
in
the
same
degree
as
the
genius
the
average
man
is
wholly
relegated
to
the
sphere
of
the
genius
on
the
other
hand
lives
and
moves
chiefly
in
the
sphere
of
this
gives
rise
to
a
twofold
distinction
in
the
first
place
a
man
can
be
one
thing
only
but
he
may
countless
things
and
thereby
to
some
extent
identify
himself
with
them
by
participating
in
what
spinoza
calls
their
in
the
second
place
the
world
as
i
have
elsewhere
observed
is
fine
enough
in
appearance
but
in
reality
dreadful
for
torment
is
the
condition
of
all
life
it
follows
from
the
first
of
these
distinctions
that
the
life
of
the
average
man
is
essentially
one
of
the
greatest
boredom
and
thus
we
see
the
rich
warring
against
boredom
with
as
much
effort
and
as
little
respite
as
fall
to
the
poor
in
their
struggle
with
need
and
adversity
and
from
the
second
of
them
it
follows
that
the
life
of
the
average
man
is
overspread
with
a
dull
turbid
uniform
gravity
whilst
the
brow
of
genius
glows
with
mirth
of
a
unique
character
which
although
he
has
sorrows
of
his
own
more
poignant
than
those
of
the
average
man
nevertheless
breaks
out
afresh
like
the
sun
through
clouds
it
is
when
the
genius
is
overtaken
by
an
affliction
which
affects
others
as
well
as
himself
that
this
quality
in
him
is
most
in
evidence
for
then
he
is
seen
to
be
like
man
who
alone
can
laugh
in
comparison
with
the
beast
of
the
field
which
lives
out
its
life
grave
and
dull
it
is
the
curse
of
the
genius
that
in
the
same
measure
in
which
others
think
him
great
and
worthy
of
admiration
he
thinks
them
small
and
miserable
creatures
his
whole
life
long
he
has
to
suppress
this
opinion
and
as
a
rule
they
suppress
theirs
as
well
meanwhile
he
is
condemned
to
live
in
a
bleak
world
where
he
meets
no
equal
as
it
were
an
island
where
there
are
no
inhabitants
but
monkeys
and
parrots
moreover
he
is
always
troubled
by
the
illusion
that
from
a
distance
a
monkey
looks
like
a
man
vulgar
people
take
a
huge
delight
in
the
faults
and
follies
of
great
men
and
great
men
are
equally
annoyed
at
being
thus
reminded
of
their
kinship
with
them
the
real
dignity
of
a
man
of
genius
or
great
intellect
the
trait
which
raises
him
over
others
and
makes
him
worthy
of
respect
is
at
bottom
the
fact
that
the
only
unsullied
and
innocent
part
of
human
nature
namely
the
intellect
has
the
upper
hand
in
him
and
prevails
whereas
in
the
other
there
is
nothing
but
sinful
will
and
just
as
much
intellect
as
is
requisite
for
guiding
his
steps
rarely
any
more
very
often
somewhat
less
and
of
what
use
is
it
it
seems
to
me
that
genius
might
have
its
root
in
a
certain
perfection
and
vividness
of
the
memory
as
it
stretches
back
over
the
events
of
past
life
for
it
is
only
by
dint
of
memory
which
makes
our
life
in
the
strict
sense
a
complete
whole
that
we
attain
a
more
profound
and
comprehensive
understanding
of
it
