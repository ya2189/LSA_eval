this

was
indeed
little
more
than
a
military
march
through

it
would
appear
that
the
syrians
soon
accustomed
themselves
to
the
presence
of
the
egyptians
in
their
midst
and
their
obedience
henceforward
could
be
fairly
relied

we
are
unable

were

circumstances
or

intrigues
which
in

led
to
a
sudden
outbreak
among

settled
on

the

arisen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
arvad
thûtmosis
instead
of
following
the
usual
caravan
route
marched
along
the
by
way
of
phoenicia
he
destroyed
arka
in
the
lebanon
and
the
surrounding
strongholds
which
were
the
haunts
of
robbers
who
lurked
in
the
mountains
then
turning
to
the
northeast
he
took
tunipa
and
extorted
the
usual
tribute
from
the
inhabitants
of
naharaim
on
the
other
hand
the
prince
of
qodshû
trusting
to
the
strength
of
his
walled
city
refused
to
do
homage
to
the
pharaoh
and
a
deadly
struggle
took
place
under
the
ramparts
in
which
each
side
availed
themselves
of
all
the
artifices
which
the
strategic
warfare
of
the
times
allowed
on
a
day
when
the
assailants
and
besieged
were
about
to
come
to
close
quarters
the
amorites
let
loose
a
mare
among
the
chariotry
of
thûtmosis
the
egyptian
horses
threatened
to
become
unmanageable
and
had
begun
to
break
through
the
ranks
when
amenemhabî
an
officer
of
the
guard
leaped
to
the
ground
and
running
up
to
the
creature
disembowelled
it
with
a
thrust
of
his
sword
this
done
he
cut
off
its
tail
and
presented
it
to
the
king
the
besieged
were
eventually
obliged
to
shut
themselves
within
their
newly
built
walls
hoping
by
this
means
to
tire
out
the
patience
of
their
assailants
but
a
picked
body
of
men
led
by
the
same
brave
amenemhabî
who
had
killed
the
mare
succeeded
in
making
a
breach
and
forcing
an
entrance
into
the
town
even
the
numerous
successful
campaigns
we
have
mentioned
form
but
a
part
though
indeed
an
important
part
of
the
wars
undertaken
by
thûtmosis
to
his
frontiers
in
the
ends
of
the
scarcely
a
year
elapsed
without
the
viceroy
of
ethiopia
having
a
conflict
with
one
or
other
of
the
tribes
of
the
upper
nile
little
merit
as
he
might
gain
in
triumphing
over
such
foes
the
spoil
taken
from
them
formed
a
considerable
adjunct
to
the
treasure
collected
in
syria
while
the
tributes
from
the
people
of
kûsh
and
the
uaûaîû
were
paid
with
as
great
regularity
as
the
taxes
levied
on
the
egyptians
themselves
it
comprised
gold
both
from
the
mines
and
from
the
rivers
feathers
oxen
with
curiously
trained
horns
giraffes
lions
leopards
and
slaves
of
all
ages
the
distant
regions
explored
by
hâtshopsîtû
continued
to
pay
a
tribute
at
intervals
a
fleet
went
to
pûanît
to
fetch
large
cargoes
of
incense
and
from
time
to
time
some
ilîm
chief
would
feel
himself
honoured
by
having
one
of
his
daughters
accepted
as
an
inmate
of
the
harem
of
the
great
king
after
the
year
xlii
we
have
no
further
records
of
the
reign
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
its
closing
years
were
less
eventful
or
less
prosperous
than
the
earlier
thûtmosis
when
conscious
of
failing
powers
may
have
delegated
the
direction
of
his
armies
to
his
sons
or
to
his
generals
but
it
is
also
quite
possible
that
he
kept
the
supreme
command
in
his
own
hands
to
the
end
of
his
days
even
when
old
age
approached
and
threatened
to
abate
his
vigour
he
was
upheld
by
the
belief
that
his
father
amon
was
ever
at
hand
to
guide
him
with
his
counsel
and
assist
him
in
battle

to
thee

the
god
the
rebels

they
may
fall

to
thee
by

the
earth
in
its

the
tribes

the
west

thy

crossed

thy
strength

in
thy
power

i
have
commanded
thee
to
let

hear
thy
roaring

shall
enter
their
dens
i
have
deprived
their
nostrils
of
the
breath

have
granted
to
thee
that
thy
deeds

hearts

my
uraeus

it
may
consume
with
its
flame

are
in

may
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
asiatics
without
one
of
them
being
able
to
escape
from
its
clutch

grant
to
thee
that
thy
conquests
may
embrace
all
lands
that
the
urseus

shines
upon
my
forehead
may
be
thy
vassal
so
that
in
all
the
compass
of
the
heaven
there
may
not
be
one
to
rise
against
thee
but
that
the
people
may
come
bearing
their
tribute
on
their
backs
and
bending
before
thy
majesty
according
to
my
behest
i
ordain
that
all
aggressors
arising
in
thy
time
shall
fail

thee

curve
described
by
it
across

after
issuing
from
the
mountains
of

the
meaning
is
doubtful
the
word
signifies
pools

provinces
situated
beyond

territory
and
consequently
the
distant
parts
of
the

the
people
of

the
juxtaposition
of
this
name
with
that
of
the
libyans
compels
us
to
look
towards
the
west
for
the
site
of
this
people
may
we
assign
to
them
the
ionian
islands
or
even
those
in
the
western
mediterranean
the
poem
became
celebrated
when
seti
two
centuries
later
commanded
the
poet
laureates
of
his
court
to
celebrate
his
victories
in
verse
the
latter
despairing
of
producing
anything
better
borrowed
the
finest
strophes
from
this
hymn
to
thûtmosis
iil
merely
changing
the
name
of
the
hero
the
composition
unlike
so
many
other
triumphal
inscriptions
is
not
a
mere
piece
of
official
rhetoric
in
which
the
poverty
of
the
subject
is
concealed
by
a
multitude
of
whether
historical
or
mythological
egypt
indeed
ruled
the
world
either
directly
or
through
her
vassals
and
from
the
mountains
of
abyssinia
to
those
of
cilicia
her
armies
held
the
nations
in
awe
with
the
threat
of
the
pharaoh
the
conqueror
as
a
rule
did
not
retain
any
part
of
their
territory
he
confined
himself
to
the
appropriation
of
the
revenue
of
certain
domains
for
the
benefit
of
his
gods
amon
of
karnak
thus
became
possessor
of
seven
syrian
towns
which
he
owed
to
the
generosity
of
the
victorious
pharaohs
the
seven
towns
which
amon
possessed
in
syria
are
mentioned
in
the
time
of
ramses
in
the
list
of
the
domains
and
revenues
of
the
god
in
the
year
on
his
return
from
his
first
campaign
thûtmosis
iii
provided
offerings
guaranteed
from
the
three
towns
anaûgasa
inûâmû
and
hûrnikarû
for
his
father
amonrâ
certain
cities
like
tunipa
even
begged
for
statues
of
thûtmosis
for
which
they
built
a
temple
and
instituted
a
cultus
amon
and
his
too
were
adored
there
side
by
side
with
the
sovereign
the
inhabitants
had
chosen
to
represent
them
here
below
these
rites
were
at
once
a
sign
of
servitude
and
a
proof
of
gratitude
for
services
rendered
or
privileges
which
had
been
confirmed
the
princes
of
neighbouring
regions
repaired
annually
to
these
temples
to
renew
their
oaths
of
allegiance
and
to
bring
their
tributes
the
face
of
the
taking
everything
into
account
the
condition
of
the
subjects
might
have
been
a
pleasant
one
had
they
been
able
to
accept
their
lot
without
any
mental
reservation
they
retained
their
own
laws
their
dynasties
and
their
frontiers
and
paid
a
tax
only
in
proportion
to
their
resources
while
the
hostages
given
were
answerable
for
their
obedience
these
hostages
were
as
a
rule
taken
by
thûtmosis
from
among
the
sons
or
the
brothers
of
the
chief
they
were
carried
to
thebes
where
a
suitable
establishment
was
assigned
to
them
the
younger
members
receiving
an
education
which
practically
made
them
egyptians
the
statues
of
thûtmosis
iii
and
of
the
gods
of
egypt
erected
at
tunipa
are
mentioned
in
a
letter
from
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
to
amenôthes
iii
later
ramses
speaking
of
the
two
towns
in
the
country
of
the
khâti
in
which
were
two
statues
of
his
majesty
mentions
tunipa
as
one
of
them
the
various
titles
of
the
lists
of
thûtmosis
iii
at
thebes
show
us
children
of
the
syrian
chiefs
conducted
as
into
the
town
of
sûhanû
which
is
elsewhere
mentioned
as
the
depot
the
prison
of
the
temple
of
anion
max
mullcr
was
the
first
to
remark
the
historical
value
of
this
indication
but
without
sufficiently
insisting
on
it
the
name
indicates
perhaps
as
he
says
a
great
prison
but
a
prison
like
those
where
the
princes
of
the
family
of
the
ottoman
sultans
were
confined
by
the
reigning
monarch
a
palace
usually
provided
with
all
the
comforts
of
oriental
life
as
soon
as
a
vacancy
occurred
in
the
succession
either
in
syria
or
in
ethiopia
the
pharaoh
would
choose
from
among
the
members
of
the
family
whom
he
held
in
reserve
that
prince
on
whose
loyalty
he
could
best
count
and
placed
him
upon
the
throne
the
method
of
procedure
was
not
always
successful
since
these
princes
whom
one
would
have
supposed
from
their
training
to
have
been
the
least
likely
to
have
asserted
themselves
against
the
man
to
whom
they
owed
their
elevation
often
gave
more
trouble
than
others
the
sense
of
the
supreme
power
of
egypt
which
had
been
inculcated
in
them
during
their
exile
seemed
to
be
weakened
after
their
return
to
their
native
country
and
to
give
place
to
a
sense
of
their
own
importance
their
hearts
misgave
them
as
the
time
approached
for
them
to
send
their
own
children
as
pledges
to
their
suzerain
and
also
when
called
upon
to
transfer
a
considerable
part
of
their
revenue
to
his
treasury
they
found
moreover
among
their
own
cities
and
kinsfolk
those
who
were
adverse
to
the
foreign
yoke
and
secretly
urged
their
countrymen
to
revolt
or
else
competitors
for
the
throne
who
took
advantage
of
the
popular
discontent
to
pose
as
champions
of
national
independence
and
it
was
difficult
for
the
vassal
prince
to
counteract
the
intrigues
of
these
adversaries
without
openly
declaring
himself
hostile
to
his
foreign
master
among
the
tel
tablets
there
is
a
letter
of
a
petty
syrian
king
adadnirari
whose
father
was
enthroned
after
a
fashion
in
nûkhassi
by
thûtmosis
iii

in
the

correspondence
zimrida
governor
of
sidon
gives
information
to
amenôthes
iii
on
the
intrigues
which
the
notables
of
the
town
were
concocting
against
egyptian
authority
ribaddû
relates
in
one
of
these
despatches
that
the
notables
of
byblos
and
the
women
of
his
harem
were
urging
him
to
revolt
later
a
letter
of
amûnirâ
to
the
king
of
egypt
informs
us
that
ribaddû
had
been
driven
from
byblos
by
his
own
brother
a
time
quickly
came
when
a
vestige
of
fear
alone
constrained
them
to
conceal
their
wish
for
liberty
the
most
trivial
incident
then
sufficed
to
give
them
the
necessary
encouragement
and
decided
them
to
throw
off
the
mask
a
repulse
or
the
report
of
a
repulse
suffered
by
the
egyptians
the
news
of
a
popular
rising
in
some
neighbouring
state
the
passing
visit
of
a
chaldæan
emissary
who
left
behind
him
the
hope
of
support
and
perhaps
of
subsidies
from
babylon
and
the
unexpected
arrival
of
a
troop
of
mercenaries
whose
services
might
be
hired
for
the
occasion
a
rising
of
this
sort
usually
brought
about
the
most
disastrous
results
the
native
prince
or
the
town
itself
could
keep
back
the
tribute
and
own
allegiance
to
no
one
during
the
few
months
required
to
convince
pharaoh
of
their
defection
and
to
allow
him
to
prepare
the
necessary
means
of
vengeance
the
advent
of
the
egyptians
followed
and
the
work
of
repression
was
systematically
set
in
hand
they
destroyed
the
harvests
whether
green
or
ready
for
the
sickle
they
cut
down
the
palms
and
olive
trees
they
tore
up
the
vines
seized
on
the
flocks
dismantled
the
strongholds
and
took
the
inhabitants
prisoners
bûrnabûriash
king
of
babylon
speaks
of
syrian
agents
who
had
come
to
ask
for
support
from

when

had
finally
obtained
peace
by

of
endless
sacrifices
he
found
himself
a
vassal

before

with
an
empty

a
wasted
country

a
decimated
people

resigned

of
egypt
to
insist
on
her
foreign
subjects
keeping
an
unbroken
peace
among
themselves
if
theoretically
she
did
not
recognise
the
right
of
private
warfare
she
at

tolerated

me
a

no
doubt
the

personal
courage
of
these
veterans
exercised
a
certain
influence
on
the
turn

but
they
were
after
all
a

of
men
and
their
individual
action
in

combat

scarcely
ever
have
been
sufficient
to
decide
the
result
the
actual
importance
of
their
support
in
spite
of
their
numerical
inferiority
lay
in
the
moral
weight
they
brought
to
the
side
on
which
they
fought
since
they
represented
the
whole
army
of
the
pharaoh
which
lay
behind
them
and
their
presence
in
a
camp
always
ensured
final
success
the
vanquished
party
had
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
sovereign
through
whom
he
might
obtain
a
mitigation
of
the
lot
which
his
successful
adversary
had
prepared
for
him
it
was
to
the
interest
of
egypt
to
keep
the
balance
of
power
as
evenly
as
possible
between
the
various
states
which
looked
to
her
and
when
she
prevented
one
or
other
of
the
princes
from
completely
crushing
his
rivals
she
was
minimising
the
danger
which
might
soon
arise
from
the
vassal
whom
she
had
allowed
to
extend
his
territory
at
the
expense
of
others
these
relations
gave
rise
to
a
perpetual
exchange
of
letters
and
petitions
between
the
court
of
thebes
and
the
northern
and
southern
provinces
in
which
all
the
petty
kings
of
africa
and
asia
of
whatever
colour
or
race
set
forth
either
openly
or
covertly
their
ambitions
and
their
fears
imploring
a
favour
or
begging
for
a
subsidy
revealing
the
real
or
suspected
intrigues
of
their
and
while
loudly
proclaiming
their
own
loyalty
denouncing
the
perfidy
and
the
secret
projects
of
their
neighbours
as
the
ethiopian
peoples
did
not
apparently
possess
an
alphabet
of
their
own
half
of
the
correspondence
which
concerned
them
was
carried
on
in
egyptian
and
written
on
papyrus
in
syria
however
where
babylonian
civilization
maintained
itself
in
spite
of
its
conquest
by
thûtmosis
cuneiform
writing
was
still
employed
and
tablets
of
dried
clay
it
had
therefore
been
found
necessary
to
establish
in
the
palace
a
department
for
this
service
in
which
the
scribes
should
be
competent
to
decipher
the
chaldæan
character
dictionaries
and
easy
mythological
texts
had
been
procured
for
their
instruction
by
means
of
which
they
had
learned
the
meaning
of
words
and
the
construction
of
sentences
having
once
mastered
the
mechanism
of
the
syllabary
they
set
to
work
to
translate
the
despatches
marking
on
the
back
of
each
the
date
and
the
place
from
whence
it
came
and
if
necessary
making
a
draft
of
the
reply
in
these
the
pharaoh
does
not
appear
as
a
rule
to
have
insisted
on
the
endless
titles
which
we
find
so
lavishly
used
in
his
inscriptions
but
the
shortened
protocol
employed
shows
that
the
theory
of
his
divinity
was
as
fully
acknowledged
by
strangers
as
it
was
by
his
own
subjects
they
greet
him
as
their
sun
the
god
before
whom
they
prostrate
themselves
seven
times
seven
while
they
are
his
slaves
his
dogs
and
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
a
discovery
made
by
the
fellahîn
in
at
tel
arnarna
in
the
rums
of
the
palace
of
khûniaton
brought
to
light
a
portion
of
the
correspondence
between
asiatic
monarchs
whether
vassals
or
independent
of
egypt
with
the
officers
of
amenôthes
iii
and
and
with
these
pharaohs
themselves
several
of
these
registrations
are
still
to
be
read
on
the
backs
of
the
tablets
at
berlin
london
and
gîzeh
protocols
of
the
letters
of
abdashirti
may
be
taken
as
an
example
or
those
of
abimilki
to
pharaoh
sometimes
there
is
a
development
of
the
protocol
which
assumes
panegyrical
features
similar
to
those
met
with
in
egypt
the
runners
to
whom
these
documents
were
entrusted
and
who
delivered
them
with
their
own
hand
were
not
as
a
rule
persons
of
any
consideration
but
for
missions
of
grave
importance
were
employed
whose
functions
in
time
became
extended
to
a
remarkable
degree
those
who
were
restricted
to
a
limited
sphere
of
activity
were
called
messengers
for
the
regions
of
the
south
or
messengers
for
the
regions
of
the
north
according
to
their
proficiency
in
the
idiom
and
customs
of
africa
or
of
asia
others
were
deemed
capable
of
undertaking
missions
wherever
they
might
be
required
and
were
therefore
designated
by
the
bold
title
of
messengers
for
all
in
this
case
extended
powers
were
conferred
upon
them
and
they
were
permitted
to
cut
short
the
disputes
between
two
cities
in
some
province
they
had
to
inspect
to
excuse
from
tribute
to
receive
presents
and
hostages
and
even
princesses
destined
for
the
harem
of
the
pharaoh
and
also
to
grant
the
support
of
troops
to
such
as
could
give
adequate
reason
for
seeking
it
their
tasks
were
always
of
a
delicate
and
not
infrequently
of
a
perilous
nature
and
constantly
exposed
them
to
the
danger
of
being
robbed
by
highwaymen
or
maltreated
by
some
insubordinate
vassal
at
times
even
running
the
risk
of
mutilation
or
assassination
by
the
way
the
tel
correspondence
shows
the
messengers
in
the
time
of
amenôthes
iii
and
iv
as
receiving
tribute
as
bringing
an
army
to
the
succour
of
a

with
the
anger
of
the
pharaoh

giving
to
a

of
escorting
a

to

to
enlist

mitanni

thûtîi

was
not
as
some
think
a
case
of
hyperbole

the
messengers

embark
on

had
a
less
distance
to
cover
in

reach
the
ægean

the

the
of
the

probably
a
type
of

any
case
his

and
adventures
are
natural
to
a

many
of
them
achieved
a
reputation
and
were
made
the
heroes
of
popular
romance
more
than
three
centuries
after
it
was
still
related
how
one
of
them
by
name
thûtîi
had
reduced
and
humbled
jaffa
whose
chief
had
refused
to

thûtîi
set
about
his
task
by
feigning
to
throw
off
his
allegiance
to
thûtmosis
and
withdrew
from
the
egyptian
service
having
first
stolen
the
great
magic
wand
of
his
lord
he
then
invited
the
rebellious
chief
into
his
camp
under
pretence
of
showing
him
this
formidable
talisman
and
killed
him
after
they
had
drunk
together

cunning
envoy

packed
five
hundred
of
his
soldiers
into

made
the
herald
of
the
murdered
prince
proclaim
that
the
egyptians
had
been
defeated
and
that
the
pack
train
which
accompanied
him
contained
the
spoil
among
which
was
thûtîi
himself
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
city
gate
was
deceived
by
this
harangue
the
asses
were
admitted
within
the
walls
where
the
soldiers
quitted
their
jars
massacred
the
garrison
and
made
themselves
masters
of
the
town
the
tale
is
in
the
main
the
story
of
ali
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
the
frontier
was
continually
shifting
and
thûtmosis
like
thûtmosis
vainly
endeavoured
to
give
it
a
fixed
character
by
erecting
stelas
along
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
at
those
points
where
he
contended
it
had
run
formerly
while
kharu
and
phoenicia
were
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
conqueror
his
suzerainty
became
more
uncertain
as
it
extended
northwards
in
the
direction
of
the
taurus
beyond
qodshû
it
could
only
be
maintained
by
means
of
constant
supervision
and
in
naharaim
its
duration
was
coextensive
with
the
sojourn
of
the
conqueror
in
the
locality
during
his
campaign
for
it
vanished
of
itself
as
soon
as
he
had
set
out
on
his
return
to
africa
it
will
be
thus
seen
that
on
the
continent
of
asia
egypt
possessed
a
nucleus
of
territories
so
far
securely
under
her
rule
that
they
might
be
actually
reckoned
as
provinces
beyond
this
immediate
domain
there
was
a
zone
of
waning
influence
whose
area
varied
with
each
reign
and
even
under
one
king
depended
largely
on
the
activity
which
he
personally
displayed
this
was
always
the
case
when
the
rulers
of
egypt
attempted
to
carry
their
supremacy
beyond
the
isthmus
whether
under
the
ptolemies
or
the
native
kings
the
distance
to
which
her
influence
extended
was
always
practically
the
same
and
the
teaching
of
history
enables
us
to
note
its
limits
on
the
map
with
relative
accuracy
the
development
of
the
egyptian
navy
enabled
the
ptolemies
to
exercise
authority
over
the
coasts
of
asia
minor
and
of
thrace
but
this
extension
of
their
power
beyond
the
indicated
limits
only
hastened
the
exhaustion
of
their
empire
this
instance
like
that
of
mehemet
ali
thus
confirms
the
position
taken
up
in
the
text
the
coast
towns
which
were
in
maritime
communication
with
the
ports
of
the
delta
submitted
to
the
egyptian
yoke
more
readily
than
those
of
the
interior
but
this
submission
could
not
be
reckoned
on
beyond
berytus
on
the
banks
of
the
lykos
though
occasionally
it
stretched
a
little
further
north
as
far
as
byblos
and
arvad
even
then
it
did
not
extend
inland
and
the
curve
marking
its
limits
traverses
from
to
terminating
at
mount
hermon
damascus
securely
entrenched
behind
almost
always
lay
outside
this
limit
the
rulers
of
egypt
generally
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
in
keeping
possession
of
the
countries
lying
to
the
south
of
this
line
it
demanded
merely
a
slight
effort
and
this
could
be
furnished
for
several
centuries
without
encroaching
seriously
on
the
resources
of
the
country
or
endangering
its
prosperity
when
however
some
province
ventured
to
break
away
from
the
control
of
egypt
the
whole
mechanism
of
the
government
was
put
into
operation
to
provide
soldiers
and
the
necessary
means
for
an
expedition
each
stage
of
the
advance
beyond
the
frontier
demanded
a
greater
expenditure
of
energy
which
with
prolonged
distances
would
naturally
become
exhausted
the
expedition
would
scarcely
have
reached
the
taurus
or
the
euphrates
before
the
force
of
circumstances
would
bring
about
its
recall
homewards
leaving
but
a
slight
bond
of
vassalage
between
the
recently
subdued
countries
and
the
conqueror
which
would
speedily
be
cast
off
or
give
place
to
relations
dictated
by
interest
or
courtesy
thûtmosis
iii
had
to
submit
to
this
sort
of
necessary
law
a
further
extension
of
territory
had
hardly
been
gained
when
his
dominion
began
to
shrink
within
the
frontiers
that
appeared
to
have
been
prescribed
by
nature
for
an
empire
like
that
of
egypt
kharû
and
phoenicia
proper
paid
him
their
tithes
with
due
regularity
the
cities
of
the
amurru
and
of
zahi
of
damascus
qodshû
hamath
and
even
of
tunipa
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
these
two
subject
nations
formed
an
borderland
kept
in
a
state
of
perpetual
disturbance
by
the
secret
intrigues
or
open
rebellions
of
the
native
princes
the
kings
of
alasia
naharaim
and
mitanni
preserved
their
independence
in
spite
of
repeated
reverses
and
they
treated
with
the
conqueror
on
equal
terms
the
difference
of
tone
between
the
letters
of
these
kings
and
those
of
the
other
princes
as
well
as
the
consequences
arising
from
it
has
been
clearly
defined
by
delattre
the
tone
of
their
letters
to
the
pharaoh
the
polite
formulas
with
which
they
addressed
him
the
special
protocol
which
the
egyptian
ministry
had
drawn
up
for
their
reply
all
differ
widely
from
those
which
we
see
in
the
despatches
coming
from
commanders
of
garrisons
or
actual
vassals
in
the
former
it
is
no
longer
a
slave
or
a
feudatory
addressing
his
master
and
awaiting
his
orders
but
equals
holding
courteous
communication
with
each
other
the
brother
of
alasia
or
of
mitanni
with
his
brother
of
egypt
they
inform
him
of
their
good
health
and
then
before
entering
on
business
they
express
their
good
wishes
for
himself
his
wives
his
sons
the
lords
of
his
court
his
brave
soldiers
and
for
his
horses
they
were
careful
never
to
forget
that
with
a
single
word
their
correspondent
could
let
loose
upon
them
a
whirlwind
of
chariots
and
archers
without
number
but
the
respect
they
felt
for
his
formidable
power
never
degenerated
into
a
fear
which
would
humiliate
them
before
him
with
their
faces
in
the
dust
this
interchange
of
diplomatic
compliments
was
called
for
by
a
variety
of
exigencies
such
as
incidents
arising
on
the
frontier
secret
intrigues
personal
alliances
and
questions
of
general
politics
the
kings
of
mesopotamia
and
of
northern
syria
even
those
of
assyria
and
chaldæa
who
were
preserved
by
distance
from
the
dangers
of
a
direct
invasion
were
in
constant
fear
of
an
unexpected
war
and
heartily
desired
the
downfall
of
egypt
they
endeavoured
meanwhile
to
occupy
the
pharaoh
so
fully
at
home
that
he
had
no
leisure
to
attack
them
even
if
they
did
not
venture
to
give
open
encouragement
to
the
disposition
in
his
subjects
to
revolt
they
at
least
experienced
no
scruple
in
hiring
emissaries
who
secretly
fanned
the
flame
of
discontent
the
pharaoh
aroused
to
indignation
by
such
plotting
reminded
them
of
their
former
oaths
and
treaties
the
king
in
question
would
thereupon
deny
everything
would
speak
of
his
tried
friendship
and
recall
the
fact
that
he
had
refused
to
help
a
rebel
against
his
beloved
brother
these
protestations
of
innocence
were
usually
accompanied
by
presents
and
produced
a
twofold
effect
they
soothed
the
anger
of
the
offended
party
and
suggested
not
only
a
courteous
answer
but
the
sending
of
still
more
valuable
gifts
oriental
etiquette
even
in
those
early
times
demanded
that
the
present
of
a
less
rich
or
powerful
friend
should
place
the
recipient
under
the
obligation
of
sending
back
a
gift
of
still
greater
worth
every
one
therefore
whether
great
or
little
was
obliged
to
regulate
his
liberality
according
to
the
estimation
in
which
he
held
himself
or
to
the
opinion
which
others
formed
of
him
and
a
personage
of
such
opulence
as
the
king
of
egypt
was
constrained
by
the
laws
of
common
civility
to
display
an
almost
boundless
generosity
was
he
not
free
to
work
the
mines
of
the
divine
land
or
the
diggings
of
the
upper
nile
and
as
for
gold
it
not
as
the
dust
of
his
see
the
letter
of
amenôthes
iii
to
kallimmasin
of
babylon
where
the
king
of
egypt
complains
of
the
inimical
designs
which
the
babylonian
messengers
had
planned
against
him
and
of
the
intrigues
they
had
connected
on
their
return
to
their
own
country
see
also
the
letter
from
burnaburiash
to
amenôthes
in
which
he
defends
himself
from
the
accusation
of
having
plotted
against
the
king
of
egypt
at
any
time
and
recalls
the
circumstance
that
his
father
kurigalzu
had
refused
to
encourage
the
rebellion
of
one
of
the
syrian
tribes
subjects
of
amenôthes
iii
see
the
letter
of
dushratta
king
of
mitanni
to
the
pharaoh
amenôthes
iv
he
would
have
desired
nothing
better
than
to
exhibit
such
liberality
had
not
the
repeated
calls
on
his
purse
at
last
constrained
him
to
parsimony
he
would
have
been
ruined
and
egypt
with
him
had
he
given
all
that
was
expected
of
him
except
in
a
few
extraordinary
cases
the
gifts
sent
never
realised
the
expectations
of
the
recipients
for
instance
when
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
of
precious
metal
were
looked
for
the
amount
despatched
would
be
merely
two
or
three
the
indignation
of
these
disappointed
beggars
and
their
recriminations
were
then
most
amusing
the
time
when
my
father
and
thine
entered
into
friendly
relations
they
loaded
each
other
with
presents
and
never
waited
to
be
asked
to
exchange
amenities
and
now
my
brother
sends
me
two
minas
of
gold
as
a
gift
send
me
abundance
of
gold
as
much
as
thy
father
sent
and
even
for
so
it
must
be
more
than
thy
pretexts
were
never
wanting
to
give
reasonable
weight
to
such
demands
one
correspondent
had
begun
to
build
a
temple
or
a
palace
in
one
of
his
capitals
another
was
reserving
his
fairest
daughter
for
the
pharaoh
and
he
gave
him
to
understand
that
anything
he
might
receive
would
help
to
complete
the
trousseau
burnaburiash
complains
that
the
messengers
had
only
brought
him
on
one
occasion
two
minas
of
gold
on
another
occasion
twenty
minas
moreover
that
the
quality
of
the
metal
was
so
bad
that
hardly
five
minas
of
pure
gold
could
be
extracted
from
it
literally
they
would
never
make
each
other
a
fair
the
meaning
i
propose
is
doubtful
but
it
appears
to
be
required
by
the
context
the
letter
from
which
this
passage
was
taken
is
from
burnaburiash
king
of
babylon
to
amenôthes
iv
this
is
the
pretext
advanced
by
burnaburiash
in
the
letter
just
cited
this
seems
to
have
been
the
motive
in
a
somewhat
embarrassing
letter
which
dushratta
king
of
mitanni
wrote
to
the
pharaoh
amenôthes
iii
on
the
occasion
of
his
fixing
the
dowry
of
his
daughter
the
princesses
thus
sent
from
babylon
or
mitanni
to
the
court
of
thebes
enjoyed
on
their
arrival
a
more
honourable
welcome
and
were
assigned
a
more
exalted
rank
than
those
who
came
from
kharû
and
phoenicia
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
hostages
given
over
to
the
conqueror
to
be
disposed
of
at
will
but
queens
who
were
united
in
legal
marriage
to
an
ally
once
admitted
to
the
court
they
retained
their
full
rights
as
his
wife
as
well
as
their
own
fortune
and
mode
of
life
some
would
bring
to
their
betrothed
chests
of
jewels
utensils
and
stuffs
the
enumeration
of
which
would
cover
both
sides
of
a
large
tablet
others
would
arrive
escorted
by
several
hundred
slaves
or
matrons
as
personal
attendants
a
few
of
them
preserved
their
original
name
many
assumed
an
egyptian
designation
and
so
far
adapted
themselves
to
the
costumes
manners
and
language
of
their
adopted
country
that
they
dropped
all
intercourse
with
their
native
land
and
became
regular
egyptians
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
khâti
wife
of
ramses
il
was
treated
as
we
see
from
the
monuments
with
as
much
honour
as
would
have
been
accorded
to
egyptian
princesses
of
pure
blood
gilukhipa
who
was
sent
to
egypt
to
become
the
wife
of
amenôthes
took
with
her
a
company
of
three
hundred
and
seventy
women
for
her
service
she
was
a
daughter
of
sutarna
king
of
mitanni
and
is
mentioned
several
times
in
the
tel
correspondence
for
example
gilukhipa
whose
name
is
transcribed
kilagîpa
in
egyptian
and
another
princess
of
mitanni
niece
of
gilukhipa
called
daughter
of
dushratta
and
wife
of
amenôthes
iv
the
prince
of
the
daughter
who
married
ramses
ii
is
an
example
we
know
her
only
by
her
egyptian
name
mâîtnofîrûrî
the
wife
of
ramses
iii
added
to
the
egyptian
name
of
isis
her
original
name
humazarati
when
after
several
years
an
ambassador
arrived
with
greetings
from
their
father
or
brother
he
would
be
puzzled
by
the
changed
appearance
of
these
ladies
and
would
almost
doubt
their
identity
indeed
those
only
who
had
been
about
them
in
childhood
were
in
such
cases
able
to
recognise
them
these
princesses
all
adopted
the
gods
of
their
husbands
though
without
necessarily
renouncing
their
own
from
time
to
time
their
parents
would
send
them
with
much
pomp
a
statue
of
one
of
their
national
divinities
ishtar
for
example
which
accompanied
by
native
priests
would
remain
for
some
months
at
the
court
this
was
the
case
with
the
daughter
of
kallimmasin
king
of
babylon
married
to
amenôthes
iii
her
ambassador
did
not
recognise
her
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
khâti
wife
of
ramses
is
represented
in
an
attitude
of
worship
before
her
deified
husband
and
two
egyptian
gods
dushratta
of
mitanni
sending
a
statue
of
ishtar
to
his
daughter
wife
of
amenôthes
reminds
her
that
the
same
statue
had
already
made
the
voyage
to
egypt
in
the
time
of
his
father
sutarna
the
children
of
these
queens
ranked
next
in
order
to
those
whose
mothers
belonged
to
the
solar
race
but
nothing
prevented
them
marrying
their
brothers
or
sisters
of
pure
descent
and
being
eventually
raised
to
the
throne
the
members
of
their
families
who
remained
in
asia
were
naturally
proud
of
these
bonds
of
close
affinity
with
the
pharaoh
and
they
rarely
missed
an
opportunity
of
reminding
him
in
their
letters
that
they
stood
to
him
in
the
relationship
of
or
one
of
his
their
vanity
stood
them
in
good
stead
since
it
afforded
them
another
claim
on
the
favours
which
they
were
perpetually
asking
of
him
dushratta
of
mitanni
never
loses
an
opportunity
of
calling
aoienôthes
husband
of
his
sister
gilukhîpa
and
of
one
of
his
daughters
my
brother
and
my
these
foreign
wives
had
often
to
interfere
in
some
of
the
contentions
which
were
bound
to
arise
between
two
states
whose
subjects
were
in
constant
intercourse
with
one
another
invasions
or
provincial
wars
may
have
affected
or
even
temporarily
suspended
the
passage
to
and
from
of
caravans
between
the
countries
of
the
tigris
and
those
of
the
nile
but
as
soon
as
peace
was
even
though
it
were
the
insecure
peace
of
those
distant
ages
the
desert
traffic
was
again
resumed
and
carried
on
with
renewed
vigour
the
egyptian
traders
who
penetrated
into
regions
beyond
the
euphrates
carried
with
them
and
almost
unconsciously
disseminated
along
the
whole
extent
of
their
route
the
numberless
products
of
egyptian
industry
hitherto
but
little
known
outside
their
own
country
and
rendered
expensive
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
transmission
or
the
greed
of
the
merchants
the
syrians
now
saw
for
the
first
time
in
great
quantities
objects
which
had
been
known
to
them
hitherto
merely
through
the
few
rare
specimens
which
made
their
way
across
the
frontier
arms
stuffs
metal
implements
household
utensils
in
fine
all
the
objects
which
ministered
to
daily
needs
or
to
luxury
these
were
now
offered
to
them
at
reasonable
prices
either
by
the
hawkers
who
accompanied
the
army
or
by
the
soldiers
themselves
always
ready
as

to
part
with
their
possessions
in

procure

extra

on

whole
convoys

were
despatched
to

were
distributed

the

always
prevented

the

of
these
objects
had
to
pay
the
custom
dues
which
were
rigorously
collected
by
the
officers
of
the
pharaoh
this
no
doubt
was
a
reprisal
tariff
since
independent
sovereigns
such
as
those
of
mitanni
assyria
and
babylon
were
accustomed
to
impose
a
similar
duty
on
all
the
products
of
egypt
the
latter
indeed
supplied
more
than
she
received
for
many
articles
which
reached
her
in
their
raw
condition
were
by
means
of
native
industry
worked
up
and
exported
as
ornaments
vases
and
highly
decorated
weapons
which
in
the
course
of
international
traffic
were
dispersed
to
all
four
corners
of
the
earth
the
merchants
of
babylon
and
assyria
had
little
to
fear
as
long
as
they
kept
within
the
domains
of
their
own
sovereign
or
in
those
of
the
pharaoh
but
no
sooner
did
they
venture
within
the
borders
of
those
turbulent
states
which
separated
the
two
great
powers
than
they
were
exposed
to
dangers
at
every
turn
were
of
little
use
if
they
had
not
taken
the
additional
precaution
of
providing
a
strong
escort
and
carefully
guarding
their
caravan
for
the
shaûsû
concealed
in
the
depths
of
the
lebanon

the

sheikhs
of

resist

temptation
to
rob

who
in
the
reign
of
ramses
ii
composed
the
of
an
speaks
in
several
places
of
marauding
tribes
and
robbers
who
infested
the
roads
followed
by
the
hero
the
tel
correspondence
contains
a
letter
from
the
king
of
alasia
who
exculpates
himself
from
being
implicated
in
the
harsh
treatment
certain
egyptians
had
received
in
passing
through
his
territory
and
another
letter
in
which
the
king
of
babylon
complains
that
chaldoan
merchants
had
been
robbed
at
khinnatun
in
galilee
by
the
prince
of
akku
acre
and
his
accomplices

of
them
had
his
feet
cut
off

other
was
still

prisoner

from

iv
the
death
of
the
guilty
persons
the
victims
complained
to
their
king
who
felt
no
hesitation
in
passing
on
their
woes
to
the
sovereign
under
whose
rule
the
pillagers
were
supposed
to
live
he
demanded
their
punishment
but
his
request
was
not
always
granted
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
finding
out
and
seizing
the
offenders
an
indemnity
however
could
be
obtained
which
would
nearly
compensate
the
merchants
for
the
loss
sustained
in
many
cases
justice
had
but
little
to
do
with
the
negotiations
in
which
was
the
chief
motive
but
repeated
refusals
would
have
discouraged
traders
and
by
lessening
the
facilities
of
transit
have
diminished
the
revenue
which
the
state
drew
from
its
foreign
commerce
the
question
became
a
more
delicate
one
when
it
concerned
the
rights
of
subjects
residing
out
of
their
native
country
foreigners
as
a
rule
were
well
received
in
egypt
the
whole
country
was
open
to
them
they
could
marry
they
could
acquire
houses
and
lands
they
enjoyed
permission
to
follow
their
own
religion
unhindered
they
were
eligible
for
public
honours
and
more
than
one
of
the
officers
of
the
crown
whose
tombs
we
see
at
thebes
were
themselves
syrians
or
born
of
syrian
parents
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
in
a
letter
from
the
king
of
alasia
there
is
question
of
a
merchant
who
had
died
in
egypt
among
other
monuments
proving
the
presence
of
syrians
about
the
pharaoh
is
the
stele
of
of
the
town
of
zairabizana
surnamed
he
was
surrounded
with
semites
like
himself
hence
those
who
settled
in
egypt
without
any
intention
of
returning
to
their
own
country
enjoyed
all
the
advantages
possessed
by
the
natives
whereas
those
who
took
up
a
merely
temporary
abode
there
were
more
limited
in
their
privileges
they
were
granted
the
permission
to
hold
property
in
the
country
and
also
the
right
to
buy
and
sell
there
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
transmit
their
possessions
at
will
and
if
by
chance
they
died
on
egyptian
soil
their
goods
lapsed
as
a
forfeit
to
the
crown
the
heirs
remaining
in
the
native
country
of
the
dead
man
who
were
ruined
by
this
confiscation
sometimes
petitioned
the
king
to
interfere
in
their
favour
with
a
view
of
obtaining
restitution
if
the
pharaoh
consented
to
waive
his
right
of
forfeiture
and
made
over
the
confiscated
objects
or
their
equivalent
to
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
it
was
solely
by
an
act
of
mercy
and
as
an
example
to
foreign
governments
to
treat
egyptians
with
a
like
clemency
should
they
chance
to
proffer
a
similar
request
all
this
seems
to
result
from
a
letter
in
which
the
king
of
alasia
demands
from
amenôthes
iii
the
restitution
of
the
goods
of
one
of
his
subjects
who
had
died
in
egypt
the
tone
of
the
letter
is
that
of
one
asking
a
favour
and
on
the
supposition
that
the
king
of
egypt
had
a
right
to
keep
the
property
of
a
foreigner
dying
on
his
territory
it
is
also
not
improbable
that
the
sovereigns
themselves
had
a
personal
interest
in
more
than
one
commercial
undertaking
and
that
they
were
the
partners
or
at
any
rate
interested
in
the
enterprises
of
many
of
their
subjects
so
that
any
loss
sustained
by
one
of
the
latter
would
eventually
fall
upon
themselves
they
had
in
fact
reserved
to
themselves
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
several
lucrative
industries
and
of
disposing
of
the
products
to
foreign
buyers
either
to
those
who
purchased
them
out
and
out
or
else
through
the
medium
of
agents
to
whom
they
intrusted
certain
quantities
of
the
goods
for
warehousing
the
king
of
babylon
taking
advantage
of
the
fashion
which
prompted
the
egyptians
to
acquire
objects
of
chaldæan
and
art
caused
ingots
of
gold
to
be
sent
to
him
by
the
pharaoh
which
he
returned
worked
up
into
vases
ornaments
household
utensils
and
plated
chariots
he
further
fixed
the
value
of
all
such
objects
and
took
a
considerable
commission
for
having
acted
as
intermediary
in
the
transaction
in
alasia
which
was
the
land
of
metals
the
king
appears
to
have
held
a
monopoly
of
the
bronze
whether
he
smelted
it
in
the
country
or
received
it
from
more
distant
regions
ready
prepared
we
can
not
say
but
he
claimed
and
retained
for
himself
the
payment
for
all
that
the
pharaoh
deigned
to
order
of
him
letter
of
burnaburiash
to
amenôthes
iv
letter
from
the
king
of
alasia
to
amenôthes
where
whilst
pretending
to
have
nothing
else
in
view
than
making
a
present
to
his
royal
brother
he
proposes
to
make
an
exchange
of
some
bronze
for
the
products
of
egypt
especially
for
gold
from
such
instances
we
can
well
understand
the
jealous
watch
which
these
sovereigns
exercised
lest
any
individual
connected
with
corporations
of
workmen
should
leave
the
kingdom
and
establish
himself
in
another
country
without
special
permission
any
emigrant
who
opened
a
workshop
and
initiated
his
new
compatriots
in
the
technique
or
professional
secrets
of
his
craft
was
regarded
by
the
authorities
as
the
most
dangerous
of
all
by
thus
introducing
his
trade
into
a
rival
state
he
deprived
his
own
people
of
a
good
customer
and
thus
rendered
himself
liable
to
the
penalties
inflicted
on
those
who
were
guilty
of
treason
his
savings
were
confiscated
his
house
razed
to
the
ground
and
his
whole
family
parents
wives
and
children
treated
as
partakers
in
his
crime
as
for
himself
if
justice
succeeded
in
overtaking
him
he
was
punished
with
death
or
at
least
with
mutilation
such
as
the
loss
of
eyes
and
ears
or
amputation
of
the
feet
this
severity
did
not
prevent
the
frequent
occurrence
of
such
cases
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
deal
with
them
by
the
insertion
of
a
special
extradition
clause
in
treaties
of
peace
and
other
alliances
the
two
contracting
parties
decided
against
conceding
the
right
of
habitation
to
skilled
workmen
who
should
take
refuge
with
either
party
on
the
territory
of
the
other
and
they
agreed
to
seize
such
workmen
forthwith
and
mutually
restore
them
but
under
the
express
condition
that
neither
they
nor
any
of
their
belongings
should
incur
any
penalty
for
the
desertion
of
their
country
it
would
be
curious
to
know
if
all
the
arrangements
agreed
to
by
the
kings
of
those
times
were
sanctioned
as
in
the
above
instance
by
properly
drawn
up
agreements
certain
expressions
occur
in
their
correspondence
which
seem
to
prove
that
this
was
the
case
and
that
the
relations
between
them
of
which
we
can
catch
traces
resulted
not
merely
from
a
state
of
things
which
according
to
their
ideas
did
not
necessitate
any
diplomatic
sanction
but
from
conventions
agreed
to
after
some
war
or
entered
on
without
any
previous
struggle
when
there
was
no
question
at
issue
between
the
two
states
the
treaty
of
ramses
ii
with
the
king
of
the
khâti
the
only
one
which
has
come
down
to
us
was
a
renewal
of
other
treaties
effected
one
after
the
other
between
the
fathers
and
grandfathers
of
the
two
contracting
sovereigns
some
of
the
tel
letters
probably
refer
to
treaties
of
this
kind
that
of
burnaburiash
of
babylon
who
says
that
since
the
time
of
karaîndash
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
ambassadors
and
friendship
between
the
sovereigns
of
chaldoa
and
of
egypt
and
also
that
of
dushratta
of
mitanni
who
reminds
queen
tîi
of
the
secret
negotiations
which
had
taken
place
between
him
and
amenôthes
iii
when
once
the
syrian
conquest
had
been
effected
egypt
gave
permanency
to
its
results
by
means
of
a
series
of
international
decrees
which
officially
established
the
constitution
of
her
empire
and
brought
about

illustrious

had
been
laid
to

his
mummy
was
not
securely
hidden
away
for
towards
the
close
of
the
xxth
dynasty
it
was
torn
out
of
the
coffin
by
robbers
who
stripped
it
and
rifled
it
of
the
jewels
with
which
it
was
covered
injuring
it
in
their
haste
to
carry
away
the
spoil
it
was
subsequently
and

remained
undisturbed

the

did

at

from

his

though
not
representing
him
as
a
type
of
manly
beauty
yet
give
him
refined
intelligent
features
but
a
comparison
with
the

shows
that
the
artists
have
idealised
their
model
the

abnormally

a
fellah
of
the
old
stock
squat
thickset
vulgar
in
character
and
expression
but
not
lacking
in
firmness
and
vigour
amenôthes
who
succeeded
him
must
have
closely
resembled
him
if
we
may
trust
his
official
portraits
he
was
the
son
of
a
princess
of
the
blood
hâtshopsîtû
daughter
of
the
great
hâtshopsîtû
and
consequently
he
came
into
his
inheritance
with
stronger
claims
to
it
than
any
other
pharaoh
since
the
time
of
amenôthes
i
possibly
his
father
may
have
associated
him
with
himself
on
the
throne
as
soon
as
the
young
prince
attained
his
majority
at
any
rate
his
accession
aroused
no
appreciable
opposition
in
the
country
and
if
any
difficulties
were
made
they
must
have
come
from
outside
the
restored
remains
allow
us
to
estimate
the
height
at
about
in
his
parentage
is
proved
by
the
pictures
preserved
in
the
tomb
of
his
where
he
is
represented
in
company
with
the
marîtrî
hâtshopsîtû
it
is
thus
that
wiedemann
explains
his
presence
by
the
side
of
thûtmosis
iii
on
certain
in
the
temple
of
amada
it
is
always
a
dangerous
moment
in
the
existence
of
a
newly
formed
empire
when
its
founder
having
passed
away
and
the
conquered
people
not
having
yet
become
accustomed
to
a
subject
condition
they
are
called
upon
to
submit
to
a
successor
of
whom
they
know
little
or
nothing
it
is
always
problematical
whether
the
new
sovereign
will
display
as
great
activity
and
be
as
successful
as
the
old
one
whether
he
will
be
capable
of
turning
to
good
account
the
armies
which
his
predecessor
commanded
with
such
skill
and
led
so
bravely
against
the
enemy
whether
again
he
will
have
sufficient
tact
to
estimate
correctly
the
burden
of
taxation
which
each
province
is
capable
of
bearing
and
to
lighten
it
when
there
is
a
risk
of
its
becoming
too
heavy
if
he
does
not
show
from
the
first
that
it
is
his
purpose
to
maintain
his
patrimony
intact
at
all
costs
or
if
his
officers
no
longer
controlled
by
a
strong
hand
betray
any
indecision
in
command
his
subjects
will
become
unruly
and
the
change
of
monarch
will
soon
furnish
a
pretext
for
widespread
rebellion
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
amenôthes
ii
was
marked
by
a
revolt
of
the
libyans
inhabiting
the
theban
oasis
but
this
rising
was
soon
put
down
by
that
amenemhabî
who
had
so
distinguished
himself
under
thûtmosis
soon
after
fresh
troubles
broke
out
in
different
parts
of
syria
in
galilee
in
the
country
of
the
amurru
and
among
the
peoples
of
naharaim
the
prompt
action
however
prevented
their
resulting
in
a
general
war
he
marched
in
person
against
the
malcontents
reduced
the
town
of
shamshiaduma
fell
upon
the
lamnaniu

attacked
their
chief

him
with
his
own
hand

off

of
captives

and
wiedemann
place
this
expedition
at
the
time
when
amenôthes
il
was
either
hereditary
prince
or
associated
with
his
father
the
inscription
of
amenemhabî
places
it
explicitly
after
the
death
of
thûtmosis
and
this
evidence
outweighs
every
other
consideration
until
further
discoveries
are
made
the
campaigns
of
amenôthes
ii
were
related
on
a
granite
stele
which
was
placed
against
the
second
of
the
southern
pylons
at
karnak
the
date
of
this
monument
is
almost
certainly
the
year
ii
there
is
strong
evidence
in
favour
of
this
if
it
is
compared
with
the
inscription
of
amada
where
amenôthes
ii
relates
that
in
the
year
iii
he
sacrificed
the
prisoners
whom
he
had
taken
in
the
country
of
tikhisa

in

and
seeing
some
mounted
troops
in
the
distance
rushed
upon
them
and
overthrew
them
they
proved
to
be
the
advanced
guard
of
the
force
which
he
encountered
shortly
afterwards
and
routed
collecting
in
the
pursuit
considerable
booty
he
finally
reached
naharaim

he
experienced
in

a
feeble
resistance

of

its

both

themselves

conqueror

suffered
persecution

considerable
section

at

soon

no

the
rapidity

his
marches
and
the
vigour
of
his
attacks
while
putting
an
end
to
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
smaller
vassal
states
were
effectual
in
inducing
the
sovereigns
of
alasia

mitanni

to
renew
with

friendly
relations

amenôthes
suppressed

in
order
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
it
was
guilty
of
an
act
of
cruel
severity
quite
in
accordance
with
the
manners
of
the
time
he
had
taken
prisoner
seven
chiefs
in
the
country

tikhisa
and
had
brought
them
chained
in
triumph
to

was
subjected
to
a
similar
fate
at
napata
at
the
beginning
of
his
third
year
and
thenceforth
the
sheîkhs

thought
twice
before
defying
the
authority
of
the
pharaoh
in
an
inscription
in
the
temple
of

it
is
there
said
that
the
king
offered
this
sacrifice
on
his
return

related
with
those

to
us
through
the
stele

karnak
was
a
short
one
lasting
ten
years
at
most
and
the
end
of
it
seems
to
have
been
darkened
by
the
open
or
secret
rivalries
which
the
question
of
the
succession
usually
stirred
up
among
the
sons
the
king
had
daughters
only
by
his
marriage
with
one
of
his
full
sisters
who
like
himself
possessed
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
those
of
his
sons
who
did
not
die
young
were
the
children
of
princesses
of
inferior
rank
or
of
concubines
and
it
was
a
subject
of
anxiety
among
these
princes
which
of
them
would
be
chosen
to
inherit
the
crown
and
be
united

whatever
might
have
been
the
nature
of
their
private
sentiments
they
professed
to
be
anxious
to
maintain
for
their
mutual
interests
the
relations
with
egypt
entered
on
half
a
century
before
and
as
the
surest
method
of
attaining
their
object
was
by
a
good
marriage
they
would
each
seek
an
egyptian
wife
for
himself
or
would
offer
amenôthes
a
princess
of
one
of
their
own
royal
families
the
egyptian
king
was
however
firm
in
refusing
to
bestow
a
princess
of
the
solar
blood
even
on
the
most
powerful
of
the
foreign
kings
his
pride
rebelled
at
the
thought
that
she
might
one
day
be
consigned
to
a
place
among
the
inferior
wives
or
concubines
but
he
gladly
accepted
and
even
sought
for
wives
for
himself
from
among
the
syrian
and
chaldæan
princesses
kallimmasin
of
babylon
gave
amenôthes
first
his
sister
and
when
age
had
deprived
this
princess
of
her
beauty
then
his
daughter
irtabi
in
marriage
letter
from
amenôthes
iii
to
kallimmasin
concerning
a
sister
of
the
latter
who
was
married
to
the
king
of
egypt
but
of
whom
there
are
no
further
records
remaining
at
babylon
and
also
one
of
his
daughters
whom
amenôthes
had
demanded
in
marriage
and
letters
from
kallimmasin
consenting
to
bestow
his
daughter
irtabi
on
the
pharaoh
and
proposing
to
give
to
amenothes
whichever
one
he
might
choose
of
the
daughters
of
his
house
sutarna
of
mitanni
had
in
the
same
way
given
the
pharaoh
his
daughter
gilukhîpa
indeed
most
of
the
kings
of
that
period
had
one
or
two
relations
in
the
harem
at
thebes
this
connexion
usually
proved
a
support
to
asiatic
sovereigns
such
alliances
being
a
safeguard
against
the
rivalries
of
their
brothers
or
cousins
at
times
however
they
were
the
means
of
exposing
them
to
serious
dangers
when
sutarna
died
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
dushratta
but
a
numerous
party
put
forward
another
prince
named
artassumara
who
was
probably
brother
on
the
side
a
hittite
king
of
the
name
of
pirkhi
espoused
the
cause
of
the
pretender
and
a
civil
war
broke
out
her
exact
relationship
is
not
explicitly
expressed
but
is
implied
in
the
facts
for
there
seems
no
reason
why
gilukhîpa
should
have
taken
the
part
of
one
brother
rather
than
another
unless
artassumara
had
been
nearer
to
her
than
dushratta
that
is
to
say
her
brother
on
the
side
as
well
as
on
the
dushratta
was
victorious
and
caused
his
brother
to
be
strangled
but
was
not
without
anxiety
as
to
the
consequences
which
might
follow
this
execution
should
gilukhîpa
desire
to
avenge
the
victim
and
to
this
end
stir
up
the
anger
of
the
suzerain
against
him
dushratta
therefore
wrote
a
humble
epistle
showing
that
he
had
received
provocation
and
that
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
to
save
his
own
life
the
tablet
was
accompanied
by
various
presents
to
the
royal
pair
comprising
horses
slaves
jewels
and
perfumes
gilukhîpa
however
bore
dushratta
no
and
the
anxieties
were
allayed
the
expeditions
of
amenôthes
to
the
syrian
provinces
must
constantly
have
been
merely
visits
of
inspection
during
which
amusements
and
especially
the
chase
occupied
nearly
as
important
a
place
as
war
and
politics
amenôthes
iii
took
to
heart
that
royal
duty
of
ridding
the
country
of
wild
beasts
and
fulfilled
it
more
conscientiously
than
any
of
his
predecessors
he
had
killed
lions
during
the
first
ten
years
of
his
reign
and
as
it
was
an
exploit
of
which
he
was
remarkably
proud
he
perpetuated
the
memory
of
it
in
a
special
inscription
which
he
caused
to
be
engraved
on
numbers
of
large
scarabs
of
fine
green
enamel
egypt
prospered
under
his
peaceful
government
and
if
the
king
made
no
great
efforts
to
extend
her
frontiers
he
spared
no
pains
to
enrich
the
country
by
developing
industry
and
agriculture
and
also
endeavoured
to
perfect
the
military
organisation
which
had
rendered
the
conquest
of
the
east
so
easy
a
matter
a
census
undertaken
by
his
minister
amenôthes
the
son
of
hâpi
ensured
a
more
correct
assessment
of
the
taxes
and
a
regular
scheme
of
recruiting
for
the
army
illustration

of
the
hunt
drawn
by
from
the
photograph

in

whole
tribes
of
slaves
were
brought
into
the
country
by
means
of
the
border
raids
which
were
always
taking
place
and
their
opportune
arrival
helped
to
fill
up
the
vacancies
which
repeated
wars
had
caused
among
the
rural

population
such
a
strong
impetus
to

was
also
given
by
this
importation

towards

the

under

struck

twelve
times
with

and
when
the
approach
to

hall
was
opened
he
repeated
the
operation
at
the
threshold
of
the
sanctuary
previous
to
entering
and
placing
his
statue
there
he
deposited
it
on
the
painted
and
gilded
wooden
platform
on
which
the
gods
were
exhibited
on
and
enthroned
beside
it
the
other
images
which
were
thenceforth
to
constitute
the
local
ennead
after
which
he
kindled
the
sacred
fire
before
them
the
queen
with
the
priests
and
nobles
all
bearing
torches
then
passed
through
the
halls
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
perform
acts
of
purification
or
to
recite
formulas
to
dispel
evil
spirits
and
pernicious
influences
finally
a
triumphal
procession
was
formed
and
the
whole
returned
to
the
palace

a
banquet
brought
the
festivities
to
a
close
it
was
amenôthes
iii
himself
or
rather
one
of
his
statues
animated
by
his
double
who
occupied
the
chief
place
in
the
new
building
indeed
wherever
we
come
across
a
temple
in
nubia
dedicated
to
a
king
we
find
the
homage
of
the
inhabitants
always
offered
to
the
image
of
the
founder
which
spoke
to
them
in
oracles
all
the
southern
part
of
the
country
beyond
the
second
cataract
is
full
of
traces
of
amenôthes
and
the
evidence
of
the
veneration
shown
to
him
would
lead
us
to
conclude
that
he
played
an
important
part
in
the
organisation
of
the
country
sedeinga
possessed
a
small
temple
under
the
patronage
of
his
wife
tîi
the
ruins
of
a
sanctuary
which
he
dedicated

anion
the
have
been
discovered
at
amenôthes
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
perceive
the
advantages
offered
by
the
site
and
to
have
endeavoured
to
transform
the
barbarian
village
of
napata
into
a
large
egyptian
city
some
of
the
monuments
with
which
he
adorned
soleb
were
transported
in
later
times
to
among
them
some
rams
and
lions
of
rare
beauty
they
lie
at
rest
with
their
paws
crossed
the
head
erect
and
their
expression
suggesting
both
power
and
repose
as
we
descend
the
nile
traces
of
the
work
of
this
king
are
less
frequent
and
their
place
is
taken
by
those
of
his
predecessors
as
at

distant
traces

in

these

on
their

their

were
either
in

quite
inadequate
to
the

now

the

shared
in
this
architectural
revival
but
it
had
suffered
too
severely
under
the
struggle
between
the
theban
kings
and
the
shepherds
to
recover
itself
as
quickly
as
the
remainder
of
the

all
effort
was
concentrated
on
those
of
its

which
lay
on
the
eastern

or
which
were
crossed
by
the
pharaohs
in
their
journeys
into

as
the

and

remained
sunk
in
their
ancient

this
torpor
at
least
as
far
as
tanis
is
concerned
to
the
aversion
felt
by
the
pharaohs
of
egyptian
blood
for
the
hyksôs
capital
and
for
the
provinces
where
the
invaders
had
formerly
established
themselves
in
large
numbers
beyond
the
red
sea
the
mines
were
actively
worked
and
even
the
oases
of
the
libyan
desert
took
part
in
the
national
revival
and
buildings
rose
in
their
midst
of
a
size
proportionate
to
their
slender
revenues
thebes
naturally
came
in
for
the
largest
share
of
the
spoils
of
war
although
her
kings
had
become
the
rulers
of
the
world
they
had
not
like
the
pharaohs
of
the
xiith
and
xiiith
dynasties
forsaken
her
for
some
more
illustrious
city
here
they
had
their
ordinary
residence
as
well
as
their
seat
of
government
hither
they
returned
after
each
campaign
to
celebrate
their
victory
and
hither
they
sent
the
prisoners
and
the
spoil
which
they
had
reserved
for
their
own
royal
use
in
the
course
of
one
or
two
generations
thebes
had
spread
in
every
direction
and
had
enclosed
within
her
circuit
the
neighbouring
villages
of
ashîrû

the
southern

lay
at

within

several
hundred
statues
in
black
granite
of
the
memphite
divinity
the
sokhît
whom
he
identified
with
his

goddess
the
statues
were
crowded
together
so
closely
that
they
were
in
actual
contact
with
each
other
in
places
and
must
have
presented
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
regiment
drawn
up
in
battle
array
the
succeeding
pharaohs
soon
came
to
look
upon
this
temple
as
a
kind
of
storehouse
whence
they
might
provide
themselves
with
figures
to
decorate
their

where

contrary
the

notices
in

seem
to
me
to
indicate
that

have
been

the

to

funeral
valley
was
a
difficult
one
and
as
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
condemn
an
entire
priesthood
to
live
in
solitude
the
king
decided
to
separate
the
component
parts
which
had
hitherto
been
united
in
every
tomb
since
the
memphite
period

to
place

the

brought
into
further
prominence
when
once
the
body
which
he
had
animated
while
on

was
removed
and
hidden
from

the
people
soon
became
accustomed
to

only
of

the
recesses
of
the

him
receive
there
the

he
collected
useful

rare
animals
it
was
that
he
might
dispose
of
them
in
the
groves
or
gardens
of
amon
as
well
as
in
his
own
and
he
never
retained
for
his
personal
use
the
whole
of
what
he
won
by
arms
but
always
reserved

portion

were

were
enriched
by
the
addition
of
vineyards
and
with
his
palm
forests
he
combined
full
of
fish
he
added
farms
and
villages
to
those
he
already
possessed
and
each
reign
saw
the
list
of
his
possessions
increase
he
had
his
own
labourers
his
own
tradespeople
his
own
fishermen
soldiers
and
scribes
and
presiding
over
all
these
a
learned
hierarchy
of
divines
priests
and
prophets
who
administered
everything
this
immense
domain
which
was
a
kind
of
state
within
the
state
was
ruled
over
by
a
single
high
priest
chosen
by
the
sovereign
from
among
the
prophets
he
was
the
irresponsible
head
of
it
and
his
spiritual
ambition
had
increased
step
by
step
with
the
extension
of
his
material
resources
as
the
human
pharaoh
showed
himself
entitled
to
homage
from
the
lords
of
the
earth
the
priests
came
at
length
to
the
conclusion
that
amon
had
a
right
to
the
allegiance
of
the
lords
of
heaven
and
that
he
was
the
supreme
being
in
respect
of
whom
the
others
were
of
little
or
no
account
and
as
he
was
the
only
god
who
was
everywhere
victorious
he
came
at
length
to
be
regarded
by
them
as
the
only
god
in
existence
it
was
impossible
that
the
kings
could
see
this
rapid
development
of
sacerdotal
power
without
anxiety
and
with
all
their
devotion
to
the
patron
of
their
city
solicitude
for
their
own
authority
compelled
them
to
seek
elsewhere
for
another
divinity
whose
influence
might
in
some
degree
counterbalance
that
of
amon
the
only
one
who
could
vie
with
him
at
thebes
either
for
the
antiquity
of
his
worship
or
for
the
rank
which
he
occupied
in
the
public
esteem
was
the
of
heliopolis
head
of
the
first
ennead
thûtmosis
iv
owed
his
crown
to
him
and
his
gratitude
in
clearing
away
the
sand
from
the
sphinx
in
which
the
spirit
of
harmakhis
was
considered
to
dwell
and
amenôthes
although
claiming
to
be
the
son
of
amon
himself
inherited
the
disposition
shown
by
thûtmosis
in
favour
of
the
heliopolitan
religions
but
instead
of
attaching
himself
to
the
forms
most
venerated
by
theologians
he
bestowed
his
affection
on
a
more
popular
deity
atonû
the
fiery
disk
he
may
have
been
influenced
in
his
choice
by
private
reasons
like
his
predecessors
he
had
taken
while
still
very
young
wives
from
among
his
own
family
but
neither
these
reasonable
ties
nor
his
numerous
diplomatic
alliances
with
foreign
princesses
were
enough
for
him
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
reign
he
had
loved
a
maiden
who
was
not
of
the
blood
of
the
pharaohs
tîi
the
daughter
of
iûîa
and
his
wife
tûîa
for
the
last
thirty
years
queen
tîi
has
been
the
subject
of
many
hypotheses
and
of
much
confusion
the
scarabasi
engraved
under
amenôthes
iii
say
explicitly
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
two
personages
iûîa
and
tûîa
but
these
names
are
not
accompanied
by
any
of
the
signs
which
are
characteristic
of
foreign
names
and
were
considered
egyptian
by
contemporaries
hincks
was
the
first
who
seems
to
have
believed
her
to
be
a
syrian
he
compares
her
name
with
that
of
levi
and
attributes
the
religious
revolution
which
followed
to
the
influence
of
her
foreign
education
this
theory
has
continued
to
predominate
some
prefer
a
libyan
origin
to
the
asiatic
one
and
latterly
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
recognise
in
tîi
one
of
the
princesses
of
mitanni
mentioned
in
the
correspondence
of
tel
as
long
ago
as
i
showed
that
tîi
was
an
egyptian
of
middle
rank
probably
of
heliopolitan
origin
connexions
of
this
kind
had
been
frequently
formed
by
his
ancestors
but
the
egyptian
women
of
inferior
rank
whom
they
had
brought
into
their
harems
had
always
remained
in
the
background
and
if
the
sons
of
these
concubines
were
ever
fortunate
enough
to
come
to
the
throne
it
was
in
default
of
heirs
of
pure
blood
amenôthes
iii
married
tîi
gave
her
for
her
dowry
the
town
of
zâlû
in
lower
egypt
and
raised
her
to
the
position
of
queen
in
spite
of
her
low
extraction
she
busied
herself
in
the
affairs
of
state
took
precedence
of
the
princesses
of
the
solar
family
and
appeared
at
her
side
in
public
ceremonies
and
was
so
figured
on
the
monuments
if
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
she
was
born
near
heliopolis
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
her
influence
may
have
led
amenôthes
to
pay
special
honour
to
a
heliopolitan
divinity
he
had
built
at
an
early
period
of
his
reign
a
sanctuary
to
atonû
at
memphis
and
in
the
xth
year
he
constructed
for
him
a
chapel
at
thebes
itself
to
the
south
of
the
last
pylon
of
ïhûtmosis
and
endowed
this
deity
with
property
at
the
expense
of
anion
this
temple
seems
to
have
been
raised
on
the
site
of
the
building
which
is
usually
attributed
to
amenôthes
ii
and
amenôthes
iii
the
blocks
bearing
the
name
of
amenôthes
ii
had
been
used
previously
like
most
of
those
which
bear
the
cartouches
of
amenôthes
iii
the
temple
of
atonû
which
was
demolished
by
harmhabî
or
one
of
the
ramses

subsequently
rebuilt
with
the
remains
of
earlier
edifices

he
had
several
sons
but
the
one
who
succeeded
him
and
who
like
him
was
named
amenôthes
was
the
most
paradoxical
of
all
the
egyptian
sovereigns
of
ancient
times
one
of
them
thûtmosis
was
high
priest
of
phtah
and
we
possess
several
monuments
erected
by
him
in
the
temple
of

became

he
also
had
several
daughters

tîi
sîtamon
the
absence
of
any
cartouches
of
amenôthes
iv
or
his
successors
in
the
table
of
abydos
prevented
champollion
and
rosellini
from
classifying
these
sovereigns
with
any
precision
nestor
tried
to
recognise
in
the
first
of
them
whom
he
called
a
king
belonging
to
the
very
ancient
dynasties
perhaps
the
hyksôs
apakhnan
but
lepsius
and
hincks
showed
that
he
must
be
placed
between
amenôthes
iii
and
harmhabî
that
he
was
first
called
amenôthes
like
his
father
but
that
he
afterwards
took
the
name
of
baknaten
which
is
now
read
khûnaten
or
khûniaton
his
singular
aspect
made
it
difficult
to
decide
at
first
whether
a
man
or
a
woman
was
represented
mariette
while
pronouncing
him
to
be
a
man
thought
that
he
had
perhaps
been
taken
prisoner
in
the
sudan
and
mutilated
which
would
have
explained
his
effeminate
appearance
almost
like
that
of
an
eunuch
recent
attempts
have
been
made
to
prove
that
amenôthes
iv
and
khûniaton
were
two
distinct
persons
or
that
khûniaton
was
a
queen
but
they
have
hitherto
been
rejected
by
egyptologists
he
made
up
for
the
inferiority
of
his
birth
on
account
of
the
plebeian
origin
of
his
mother
tîî
by
his
marriage
with
nofrîtîti
a
princess
of
the
pure
solar
race
tîi
long
accustomed
to
the
management
of
affairs
exerted
her
influence
over
him
even
more
than
she
had
done
over
her
husband
without
officially
assuming
the
rank
she
certainly
for
several
years
possessed
the
power
of
regent
and
gave
a
definite
oriental
impress
to
her
religious
policy
no
outward
changes
were
made
at
first
amenôthes
although
showing
his
preference
for
heliopolis
by
inscribing
in
his
protocol
the
title
of
prophet
of
harmakhis
which
he
may
however
have
borne
before
his
accession
maintained
his
residence
at
thebes
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
continued
to
sacrifice
to
the
theban
divinities
and
to
follow
the
ancient
paths
and
the
conventional
practices
the
filiation
of
amenôthes
iv
and
tîi
has
given
rise
to
more
than
one
controversy
the
egyptian
texts
do
not
define
it
explicitly
and
the
title
borne
by
tîi
has
been
considered
by
some
to
prove
that
amenôthes
iv
was
her
son
and
by
others
that
she
was
the
mother
of
queen
nofrîtîti
the
tel
correspondence
solves
the
question
however
as
it
gives
a
letter
from
dushratta
to
khûniaton
in
which
tîi
is
called
nofrîtîti
the
wife
of
amenôthes
like
all
the
princesses
of
that
time
has
been
supposed
to
be
of
syrian
origin
and
to
have
changed
her
name
on
her
arrival
in
egypt
the
place
which
she
holds
beside
her
husband
is
the
same
as
that
which
belongs
to
legitimate
queens
like
nofritari
ahmosis
and
hâtshopsîtû
and
the
example
of
these
princesses
is
enough
to
show
us
what
was
her
real
position
she
was
most
probably
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
princesses
of
the
solar
blood
perhaps
of
one
of
the
sisters
of
amenôthes
and
amenôthes
iv
married
her
so
as
to
obtain
through
her
the
rights
which
were
wanting
to
him
through
his
mother
tîi
the
tomb
of
ramses
governor
of
thebes
and
priest
of
mâît
shows
us
in
one
part
of
it
the
king
still
faithful
to
his
name
of
amenôthes
paying
homage
to
the
god
amon
lord
of
karnak
while
everywhere
else
the
worship
of
atonû
predominates
the
cartouches
on
the
tomb
of
pari
read
by
bouriant
akhopîrûrî
and
by
scheil
more
correctly
nofirkhopîrûrî
seem
to
me
to
represent
a
transitional
form
of
the
protocol
of
amenôthes
and
not
the
name
of
a
new
pharaoh
the
inscription
in
which
they
are
to
be
found
bears
the
date
of
his
third
year
he
either
built
a
temple
to
the
theban
god
or
enlarged
the
one
which
his
father
had
constructed
at
karnak
and
even
opened
new
quarries
at
syene
and
silsileh
for
providing
granite
and
sandstone
for
the
adornment
of
this
monument
his
devotion
to
the
invincible
disk
however
soon
began
to
assert
itself
and
rendered
more
and
more
irksome
to
him
the
religious
observances
which
he
had
constrained
himself
to
follow
there
was
nothing
and
no
one
to
hinder
him
from
giving
free
course
to
his
inclinations
and
the
nobles
and
priests
were
too
well
trained
in
obedience
to
venture
to
censure
anything
he
might
do
even
were
it
to
result
in
putting
the
whole
population
into
motion
from
elephantine
to
the
to
prepare
for
the
intruded
deity
a
dwelling
which
should
eclipse
in
magnificence
the
splendour
of
the
great
temple
a
few
of
those
around
him
had
become
converted
of
their
own
accord
to
his
favourite
worship
but
these
formed
a
very
small
minority
thebes
had
belonged
to
amon
so
long
that
the
king
could
never
hope
to
bring
it
to
regard
atonû
as
anything
but
a
being
of
inferior
rank
each
city
belonged
to
some
god
to
whom
was
attributed
its
origin
its
development
and
its
prosperity
and
whom
it
could
not
forsake
without
renouncing
its
very
existence
if
thebes
became
separated
from
amon
it
would
be
thebes
no
longer
and
of
this
amenôthes
was
so
well
aware
that
he
never
attempted
to
induce
it
to
renounce
its
patron
his
residence
among
surroundings
which
he
detested
at
length
became
so
intolerable
that
he
resolved
to
leave
the
place
and
create
a
new
capital
elsewhere
the
choice
of
a
new
abode
would
have
presented
no
difficulty
to
him
had
he
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
relegate
atonû
to
the
second
rank
of
divinities
memphis
heracleopolis
siût
khmûnû
and
in
fact
all
the
towns
of
the
valley
would
have
deemed
themselves
fortunate
in
securing
the
inheritance
of
their
rival
but
not
one
of
them
would
be
false
to
its
convictions
or
accept
the
degradation
of
its
own
divine
founder
whether
phtah
harshafîtû
anubis
or
thot
a
newly
promoted
god
demanded
a
new
city
amenôthes
therefore
made
selection
of
a
broad
plain
extending
on
the
right
bank
of
the
nile
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
hermopolitan
nome
to
which
he
removed
with
all
his
court
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
year
of
his
reign
the
last
date
with
the
name
of
amenôthes
is
that
of
the
year
on
a
papyrus
from
the
payilm
elsewhere
we
find
from
the
year
vi
the
name
of
khûniaton
by
the
side
of
monuments
with
the
cartouche
of
amenôthes
we
may
conclude
from
this
that
the
foundation
of
the
town
dates
from
the
year
iv
or
at
the
latest
when
the
prince
having
renounced
the
worship
of
amon
left
thebes
that
he
might
be
able
to
celebrate
freely
that
of
atonû
he
found
here
several
obscure
villages
without
any
historical
or
religious
traditions
and
but
thinly
populated
amenôthes
chose
one
of
them
the
of
the
present
day
and
built
there
a
palace
for
himself
and
a
temple
for
his
god
the
temple
like
that
of
eâ
at
heliopolis
was
named
the
mansion
of
the
obelisk
it
covered
an
immense
area
of
which
the
sanctuary
however
occupied
an
inconsiderable
part
it
was
flanked
by
brick
storehouses
and
the
whole
was
surrounded
by
a
thick
wall
the
remains
show
that
the
temple
was
built
of
white
limestone
of
fine
quality
but
that
it
was
almost
devoid
of
ornament
for
there
was
no
time
to
cover
it
with
the
usual
decorations
the
opinion
of
brugsch
that
the
arrangement
of
the
various
parts
differed
from
that
of
other
temples
and
was
the
effect
of
foreign
influence
has
not
been
borne
out
by
the
excavations

which

the

audiences

elsewhere
the
walls
and
pillars
were
coated
with
stucco
or
whitewash
on
which
scenes
of
private
life
were
depicted
in
colours
the
pavement
like
the
walls
was
also
decorated
in
one
of
the
halls
which
seems
to
have
belonged
to
the
harem
there
is
still
to
be
seen
distinctly
the
picture
of
a
rectangular
piece
of
water
containing
fish

in
full
bloom
the

adorned
with

of

at

were
seen
the
grinning
faces
of
a
gang
of
negro
and
syrian
prisoners
separated
from
each
other

gigantic
arches
the
tone
of

is
bright
and
cheerful

are
treated
with
great
freedom
and
facility
the
pharaoh
had
collected
about
him
several
of
the
best
artists
then
to
be
found
at
thebes
placing
them
under
the
direction
of
baûki
the
chief
of
the
corporation
of
sculptors
and
probably
others
subsequently
joined
these
from
provincial
studios
baûki
belonged
to
a
family
of
artists
and
his
father
mani
had
filled
before
him
the
post
of
chief
of
the
sculptors
the
part
played
by
these
personages
was
first
defined
by
brugsch
with
perhaps
some
exaggeration
of
their
artistic
merit
and
originality
of
talent
work
for
them
was
not
lacking
for
houses
had
to
be
built
for
all
the
courtiers
and
government
officials
who
had
been
obliged
to
follow
the
king
and
in
a
few
years
a
large
town
had
sprung
up
which
was
called
khûîtatonû
or
the
of
the
it
was
built
on
a
regular
plan
with
straight
streets
and
open
spaces
and
divided
into
two
separate
quarters
interspersed
with
orchards
and
shady
trellises
workmen
soon
began
to
flock
to
the
new
city
weavers
in
fine
all
who
followed
any
trade
indispensable
to
the
luxury
of
a
capital
the
king
appropriated
a
territory
for
it
from
the
ancient
nome
of
the
hare
thus
compelling
the
god
thot
to
contribute
to
the
fortune
of
atonû
he
fixed
its
limits
by
means
of
stelæ
placed
in
the
mountains
from
to
deshlûît
on
the
west
and
from
to
on
the
eastern
bank
it
was
a
new
nome
improvised
for
the
divine
we
know
at
present
of
fourteen
of
these
stelæ
a
certain
number
must
still
remain
to
be
discovered
on
both
banks
of
the
nile
illustration
the
decorated
pavement
of
the
palace
atonû
was
one
of
the
forms
of
the
sun
and
perhaps
the
most
material
one
of
all
those
devised
by
the
egyptians
he
was
defined
as
good
god
who
rejoices
in
truth
the
lord
of
the
solar
course
the
lord
of
the
disk
the
lord
of
heaven
the
lord
of
earth
the
living
disk
which
lights
up
the
two
worlds
the
living
harmakhis
who
rises
on
the
horizon
bearing
his
name
of
shû
which
is
disk
the
eternal
infuser
of
his
priests
exercised
the
same
functions
as
those
of
heliopolis
and
his
high
priest
was
called
like
the
high
priest
of
râ
in
aunû
this
functionary
was
a
certain
marirl
upon
whom
the
king
showered
his
favours
and
he
was
for
some
time
the
chief
authority
in
the
state
after
the
pharaoh
himself
atonû
was
represented
sometimes
by
the
ordinary
figure
of
horus
sometimes
by
the
solar
disk
but
a
disk
whose
rays
were
prolonged
towards
the
earth
like
so
many
arms
ready
to
lay
hold
with
their
little
hands
of
the
offerings
of
the
faithful
or
to
distribute
to
mortals
the
the
symbol
of
life
the
other
gods
except
amon
were
sharers
with
humanity
in
his
benefits
atonû
proscribed
him
and
tolerated
him
only
at
thebes
he
required
moreover
that
the
name
of
amon
should
be
effaced
wherever
it
occurred
but
he
respected
râ
and
horus
and
harmakhis
all
in
fact
but
amon
he
was
content
with
being
regarded
as
their
king
and
he
strove
rather
to
become
their
chief
than
their
destroyer
it
was
probably
this
form
of
horus
which
had
in
the
temple
at
thebes
the
statue
called

of
atonû

atonû
worshipped
by
khûniatonû
his
nature
moreover
had
nothing
in
it
of
the
mysterious
or
ambiguous
he
was
the
glorious
torch
which
gave
light
to
humanity
and
which
was
seen
every
day
to
flame
in
the

without
ever
losing
its
brilliance

these
extracts
are
taken
from
the
hymns
of
tel
in
one
of
the
tombs
at
tel
the
king
is
depicted
leading
his
mother
tîi
to
the
temple
of
atonû
in
order
to
see
shadow
of
râ
and
it
was
thought
with
some
reason
that
shadow
of
was
one
of
the
names
of
the
temple
i
think
that
this
designation
applied
also
to
the
statue
or
symbol
of
the
god
the
of
a
god
was
attached
to
the
statue
in
the
same
manner
as
the
and
transformed
it
into
an
animated
body
his
worship
assumes
none
of
the
severe
and
gloomy
forms
of
the
theban
cults
songs
resound
therein
and
hymns
accompanied
by
the
harp
or
flute
bread
cakes
vegetables
fruits
and
flowers
are
associated
with
his
rites
and
only
on
very
rare
occasions
one
of
those
bloody
sacrifices
in
which
the
other
gods
delight
the
king
made
himself
supreme
pontiff
of
atonu
and
took
precedence
of
the
high
priest
he
himself
celebrated
the
rites
at
the
altar
of
the
god
and
we
see
him
there
standing
erect
his
hands
outstretched
offering
incense
and
invoking
blessings
from
on
high
like
the
caliph
hakim
of
a
later
age
he
formed
a
school
to
propagate
his
new
doctrines
and
preached
them
before
his
courtiers
if
they
wished
to
please
him
they
had
to
accept
his
teaching
and
show
that
they
had
profited
by
it
the
renunciation
of
the
traditional
religious
observances
of
the
solar
house
involved
also
the
rejection
of
such
personal
names
as
implied
an
ardent
devotion
to
the
banished
god
in
place
of
amenôthes
to
whom
amon
is
united
the
king
assumed
after
a
time
the
name
of
khûniatonû
glory
of
the
disk
and
all
the
members
of
his
family
as
well
as
his
adherents
at
court
whose
appellations
involved
the
name
of
the
same
god
soon
followed
his
example
the
proscription
of
amon
extended
to
inscriptions
so
that
while
his
name
or
figure
wherever
either
could
be
got
at
was
chiselled
out
the
vulture
the
emblem
of
mût
which
expressed
the
idea
of
mother
was
also
avoided
the
altar
on
which
the
king
stands
upright
is
one
of
those
cubes
of
masonry
of
which
naville
discovered
such
a
fine
example
in
the
temple
of
hâtshopsîtû
at
deîr
we
find
however
some
instances
where
the
draughtsman
either
from
custom
or
design
had
used
the
vulture
to
express
the
word
mailt
mother
without
troubling
himself
to
think
whether
it
answered
to
the
name
of
the
goddess
the
king
would
have
nothing
about
him
to
suggest
to
eye
or
ear
the
remembrance
of
the
gods
or
doctrines
of
thebes
it
would
consequently
have
been
fatal
to
them
and
their
pretensions
to
the
primacy
of
egypt
if
the
reign
of
the
young
king
had
continued
as
long
as
might
naturally
have
been
expected
after
having
been
for
nearly
two
centuries
almost
the
national
head
of
africa
amon
was
degraded
by
a
single
blow
to
the
secondary
rank
and
languishing
existence
in
which
he
had
lived
before
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksôs
he
had
surrendered
his
sceptre
as
king
of
heaven
and
earth
not
to
any
of
his
rivals
who
in
old
times
had
enjoyed
the
highest
rank
but
to
an
individual
of
a
lower
order
a
sort
of
demigod
while
he
himself
had
thus
become
merely
a
local
deity
confined
to
the
corner
of
the
said
in
which
he
had
had
his
origin
there
was
not
even
left
to
him
the
peaceful
possession
of
this
restricted
domain
for
he
was
obliged
to
act
as
host
to
the
enemy
who
had
deposed
him
the
temple
of
atonû
was
erected
at
the
door
of
his
own
sanctuary
and
without
leaving
their
courts
the
priests
of
amon
could
hear
at
the
hours
of
worship
the
chants
intoned
by
hundreds
of
heretics
in
the
temple
of
the
disk
priests
saw
moreover
the
royal
gifts
flowing
into
other
treasuries
and
the
gold
of
syria
and
ethiopia
no
longer
came
into
their
hands
should
they
stifle
their
complaints
and
bow
to
this
insulting
oppression
or
should
they
raise
a
protest
against
the
action
which
had
condemned
them
to
obscurity
and
a
restricted
existence
if
they
had
given
indications
of
resistance
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
submit
to
prompt
repression
but
we
see
no
sign
of
this
the
bulk
of
the
people
clerical
as
well
as
lay
accepted
the
deposition
with
complacency
and
the
nobles
hastened
to
offer
their
adherence
to
that
which
afterwards
became
the
official
confession
of
faith
of
the
lord
king
the
lord
of
thebes
itself
a

bowed
his
head
to
the
new
cult
and
the
of
his
tomb
display
to
our
eyes
the
proofs
of
his
apostasy
on
the
side
amon
is
the
only
subject
of
his
devotion
while
on
the
left
he
declares
himself
an
adherent
of
atonû
religious
formularies

appellations
the
representations
of
the
costume

and
demeanour
of
the
figures
are
at
issue
with
each
other
in
the
scenes
on
the
two
sides
of
the
door
and
if
we
were
to
trust
to
appearances
only
one
would
think
that
the
two
pictures
belonged
to
two
separate
reigns
and
were
concerned
with
two
individuals
strangers
to
each
other
the
political
character
of
this
reaction
against
the
growing
power
of
the
high

pointed
out
for
the
first

a
monotheistic

which
does
not

to
me
to
be
fully
justified

at
present
by
anything
in
the
materials
we
possess
his
tomb
was
discovered
in
by
the
rupture
between
the
past
and
the
present
was
so
complete
in
fact
that
the
sovereign
was
obliged
to
change
if
not
his
face
and
expression

the
mode
in
which
they
were
represented

thinks
that
the
monument
discovered
by
him
which
is
of
fine
plaster
is
a
cast
of
the
dead
king
executed
possibly
to
enable
the
sculptors
to
make
for
him
the
name
and
personality
of
an
egyptian
were
so
closely
allied
that
interference
with
one
implied
interference
with
the
other
khûniatonû
could
not
continue
to
be
such
as
he
was
when
amenôthes
and
in
fact
their
respective
portraits
differ
from
each
other
to
that
degree
that
there
is
some
doubt
at
moments
as
to
their
identity
amenôthes
is
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
his
father
he
has
the
same
regular
and
somewhat
heavy
features
the
same
idealised
body
and
conventional
shape
as
those
which
we
find
in
the
orthodox
pharaohs
khûniatonû

a
long
and
narrow
head
conical
at
the
top
with
a
retreating
forehead
a
large
aquiline
and
pointed
nose
a
small
mouth
an
enormous
chin
projecting
in
front
the
whole
being
supported
by
a
long
thin
neck
his
shoulders
are
narrow
with
little
display
of
muscle
but
his
breasts
are
so
full
his
abdomen
so
prominent
and
his
hips
so
large
that
one
would
think
they
belonged
to
a
woman
etiquette

the
attendants
upon
the
king
and
those
who
aspired
to
his
favour
to
be
portrayed
in
the
of
temples
or
tombs
in
all
points
both
as
regards
face
and
demeanour
like
the
king
himself
hence
it
is
that
the
majority
of
his
contemporaries
after
having
borne
the
likeness
of
amenôthes
came
to
adopt
without
a
break
that
of
khûniatonû
the
scenes
at
tel
contain
therefore
nothing
but
angular
profiles
pointed
skulls
ample
breasts
flowing
figures
and
swelling
stomachs
the
outline
of
these
is
one
that
lends
itself
readily
to
caricature
and
the
artists
have
exaggerated
the
various
details
with
the
intention
it
may
be
of
rendering
the
representations
grotesque
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
however
in
the
king
their
model
and
several
of
his
statues
attribute
to
him
a
languid
almost
valetudinarian
grace
which
is
by
no

lacking

dignity

kind
a
citizen
of
khûîtatonû
would
naturally
represent
the

this
would
account
for
the
local
colouring

in
no

from
those
in
the
necropolis
of
the

there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
artists
who
decorated
these
monuments
were
trained
in
the
schools
of
thebes
their
drawing
is
often
very
refined
and
there
is
great
freedom
in
their
composition
the
perspective
of
some
of
the
almost
comes
up
to
our
own
and
the
movement
of
animated
crowds
is
indicated
with
perfect
accuracy
it
is
however
not
safe
to
conclude
from
these
examples
that
the
artists
who
executed
them
would
have
developed
egyptian
art
in
a
new
direction
had
not
subsequent

caused

reaction

the

in

differ
from

their

not
arise
from
any
effort
either
conscious
or
otherwise
to
break
through
the
ordinary
routine

the

it
is
rather
the
result

the
extraordinary
appearance
of
the
sovereign
whose
features

were
called
on
to
portray

the
novelty
of

of
the

they

undeniable
originality

he
did

the
portraits
which
he
sketched
of
the
daughters
of

playing
undressed

are
examples
of
a
reserved
and
delicate
grace
but
these
models
when
once
composed
and
finished
even
to
the
smallest
details
were
entrusted
for
execution
to
workmen
of
mediocre
powers
who
were
recruited
not
only
from
thebes

from
the
neighbouring

servants
whom
the
proprietor
of
the
tomb
desired
should
share
in
his

happiness
the
style
of
these
draughtsmen
betrays
the
influence
of
the
schools
in
which
they
had
learned
their
craft

the
clumsiness
of
their
work

often
repel

there
is
no

to
the
approximate
date
which
i
have
given
in

of
this

and
i
give
the
years
to
as
the
period
of
the
dynasty
with
a
possible
error
of
about
fifty
years
more
or
less
scarcely
half
a
century
had
elapsed
between
the
moment
when
the
dynasty
reached
the
height
of
its
power
under
amenôthes
iii
and
that
of
its
downfall
it
is
impossible
to
introduce
with
impunity
changes
of
any
kind
into
the
constitution
or
working
of
so
complicated
a
machine
as
an
empire
founded
on
conquest
when
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
have
been
once
put
together
and
set
in
motion
and
have
become
accustomed
to
work
harmoniously
at
a
proper
pace
interference
with
it
must
not
be
attempted
except
to
replace
such
parts
as
are
broken
or
worn
out
by
others
exactly
like
them
to
make
alterations
while
the
machine
is
in
motion
or
to
introduce
new
combinations
however
ingenious
into
any
part
of
the
original
plan
might
produce
an
accident
or
a
breakage
of
the
gearing
when
perhaps
it
would
be
least
expected
when
the
devout
khûniatonû
exchanged
one
city
and
one
god
for
another
he
thought
that
he
was
merely
transposing
equivalents
and
that
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
was
not
concerned
in
the
operation
whether
it
was
amon
or
atonu
who
presided
over
the
destinies
of
his
people
or
whether
thebes
or
tel
were
the
centre
of
impulse
was
in
his
opinion
merely
a
question
of
internal
arrangement
which
could
not
affect
the
economy
of
the
whole
but
events
soon
showed
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
calculations
it
is
probable
that
if
on
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksôs
the
earlier
princes
of
the
dynasty
had
attempted
an
alteration
in
the
national
religion
or
had
moved
the
capital
to
any
other
city
they
might
select
the
remainder
of
the
kingdom
would
not
have
been
affected
by
the
change
but
after
several
centuries
of
faithful
adherence
to
amon
in
his
city
of
thebes
the
governing
power
would
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
accomplish
such
a
resolution
during
three
centuries
the
dynasty
had
become
wedded
to
the
city
and
to
its
patron
deity
and
the
locality
had
become
so
closely
associated
with
the
dynasty
that
any
blow
aimed
at
the
god
could
not
fail
to
destroy
the
dynasty
with
it
indeed
had
the
experiment
of
khûniatonû
been
prolonged
beyond
a
few
years
it
might
have
entailed
the
ruin
of
the
whole
country
all
who
came
into
contact
with
egypt
or
were
under
her
rule
whether
asiatics
or
africans
were
quick
to
detect
any
change
in
her
administration
and
to
remark
a
falling
away
from
the
traditional
systems
of
the
times
of
thûtmosis
iii
and
amenothes
ii
the
successors
of
the
heretic
king
had
the
sense
to
perceive
at
once
the
first
symptoms
of
disorder
and
to
refrain
from
persevering
in
his
errors
but
however
quick
they
were
to
undo
his
work
they
could
not
foresee
its
serious
consequences
his
immediate
followers
were
powerless
to
maintain
their
dynasty
and
their
posterity
had
to
make
way
for
a
family
who
had
not
incurred
the
hatred
of
amon
or
rather
that
of
his
priests
if
those
who
followed
them
were
able
by
their
tact
and
energy
to
set
egypt
on
her
feet
again
they
were
at
the
same
time
unable
to
restore
her
former
prosperity
or
her
boundless
confidence
in
herself

by

a

harmhabî
who
was
himself
descended
from
thûtmosis
was
raised
to
the
kingly
office
his
mother
mûtnozmît
was
of
the
royal

one
of
the
most
beautiful
statues
in
the

probably

iii
father
of
his
champollion
called

hornemnob
rosellini

identified
him
with

of

the
custom
among
egyptologists
for
a
long
time
to
designate
him
by
the
name
horus
dévéria
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
name
corresponded
with
the
armais
of
the
lists
of
manetho
and
in
fact
armais
is
the
greek
transcription
of
the
group
harmhabî
in
the
bilingual
texts
of
the
ptolemaic
period
mûtnozmît
was
at
first
considered
the
daughter
and
successor
of
harmhabî
or
his
wife
birch
showed
that
the
monuments
did
not
confirm
these
hypotheses
and
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
she
was
mother
as
far
as
i
can
see
for
the
present
it
is
the
only
solution
which
agrees
with
the
evidence
on
the
principal
monument
which
has
made
known
her
existence
he
was
born
probably
in
the
last
years
of
amenôthes
when
tîi
was
the
exclusive
favourite
of
the
sovereign
but
it
was
alleged
later
on
when
harmhabî
had
emerged
from
obscurity
that
amon
destining
him
for
the
throne
had
condescended
to
become
his
father
by
mûtnozmît
a
customary
procedure
with
the
god
when
his
race
on
earth
threatened
to
become
debased
it
was
he
who
had
rocked
the
newly
born
infant
to
sleep
and
while
harsiesis
was
strengthening
his
limbs
with
protective
amulets
had
spread
over
the
skin
the
freshness
and
brilliance
which
are
the
peculiar
privilege
of
the
immortals
while
still
in
the
nursery
the
great
and
the
insignificant
alike
prostrated
themselves
before
harmhabî
making
him
liberal
offerings
every
one
recognised
in
him
even
when
still
a
lad
and
incapable
of
reflection
the
carriage
and
complexion
of
a
god
and
horus
of
cynopolis
was
accustomed
to
follow
his
steps
knowing
that
the
time
of
his
advancement
was
near
after
having
called
the
attention
of
the
egyptians
to
harmhabî
amon
was
anxious
in
fact
to
hasten
the
coming
of
the
day
when
he
might
confer
upon
him
supreme
rank
and
for
this
purpose
inclined
the
heart
of
the
reigning
pharaoh
towards
him
aï
proclaimed
him
his
heir
over
the
whole
land
all
that
we
know
of
the
youth
of
harmhabî
is
contained
in
the
texts
on
a
group
preserved
in
the
turin
museum
and
pointed
out
by
champollion
translated
and
published
subsequently
by
birch
and
by
brugsch
the
first
lines
of
the
inscription
seem
to
me
to
contain
an
account
of
the
union
of
amon
with
the
queen
analogous
to
those
at
deîr
treating
of
the
birth
of
hâtshopsîtû
and
to
those
at
luxor
bearing
upon
amenôthes
iii
cf
vol
iv
pp
and
of
the
present
volume
and
to
prove
for
certain
that
mother
was
a
princess
of
the
royal
line
by
right
the
king
is
not
named
in
the
inscription
it
can
not
have
been
amenôthes
for
an
individual
of
the
importance
of
harmhabî
living
alongside
this
king
would
at
least
have
had
a
tomb
begun
for
him
at
tel
we
may
hesitate
between
aï
and
tûtankhamon
but
the
inscription
seems
to
say
definitely
that
harmhabî
succeeded
directly
to
the
king
under
whom
he
had
held
important
offices
for
many
years
and
this
compels
us
to
fix
upon
aï
who
as
we
have
said
at
et
of
the
present
volume
was
to
all
appearances
the
last
of
the
heretical
sovereigns
he
never
gave
cause
for
any
dissatisfaction
when
called
to
court
and
when
he
was
asked
questions
by
the
monarch
he
replied
always
in
fit
terms
in
such
words
as
were
calculated
to
produce
serenity
and
thus
gained
for
himself
a
reputation
as
the
incarnation
of
wisdom
all
his
plans
and
intentions
appearing
to
have
been
conceived
by
thot
the
ibis
himself
for
many
years
he
held
a
place
of
confidence
with
the
sovereign
the
nobles
from
the
moment
he
appeared
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
bowed
their
backs
before
him
the
barbaric
chiefs
from
the
north
or
south
stretched
out
their
arms
as
soon
as
they
approached
him
and
gave
him
the
adoration
they
would
bestow
upon
a
god
his
favourite
residence
was
memphis
his
preference
for
it
arising
from
his
having
possibly
been
born
there
or
from
its
having
been
assigned
to
him
for
his
abode
here
he
constructed
for
himself
a
magnificent
tomb
the
of
which
exhibit
him
as
already
king
with
the
sceptre
in
his
hand
and
the
uraaus
on
his
brow
while
the
adjoining
cartouche
does
not
as
yet
contain
his
name
this
part
of
the
account
is
based
upon
a
study
of
a
certain
number
of
texts
and
representations
all
coming
from
tomb
at
saqqârah
and
now
scattered
among
the
various
museums
at
gîzeh
leyden
london
and
alexandria
birch
was
the
first
to
assign
those
monuments
to
the
pharaoh
harmhabî
supposing
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
been
dethroned
by
ramses
and
had
lived
at
memphis
in
an
intermediate
position
between
that
of
a
prince
and
that
of
a
private
individual
this
opinion
was
adopted
by
ed
meyer
rejected
by
wiedemann
and
by
myself
after
full
examination
i
think
the
harmhabî
of
the
tomb
at
saqqârah
and
the
pharaoh
harmhabî
are
one
and
the
same
person
harmhabî
sufficiently
high
placed
to
warrant
his
wearing
the
uraius
but
not
high
enough
to
have
his
name
inscribed
in
a
cartouche
must
have
had
his
tomb
constructed
at
saqqârah
as
aï
and
possibly
ramses
had
theirs
built
for
them

led

to

in
order
that
the

might
bestow
upon
him
the
right
to

the
reception
took

served

the

the
heir
of

took
him
with
him

the

to
a
gap
the
text
can
not
be
accurately
translated
at
this
point
the
reading
can
be
made
out
that
amon
himself
to

the

him
as
far
as
the
sanctuary
of
his

the
very

placed
herself

be

that
the
name
of
the
daughter
of
amon
is

birch
thought
that
a
terrestrial
princess
whom
harmhabî
had
married
was
in

according
to
brugsch
if
the
reference
is
not
to
a
goddess
who
along
with
amon
took
part
in
the
ceremonies
but
to
mûtnozmît
we
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
as
heir
and
queen
by
birth
must
have
ceded
her
rights
by
some
ritual
to
her
son
before
he
could
be
crowned
amon

his
son
before
him
at

to
put
upon
his

the

we
give
to
him
the

has

he

pleasure

and
may
he
add
to
the
veneration
with
which
these

they
immediately
decided
that
the
new
pharaoh
should
be
called
mighty

the

as
he
became
king
only
by
a
divine
decree
he
had
publicly
to
express
at
the
moment
of
his
elevation
his
debt
of
gratitude
to
and
his
boundless
respect
for
the
deity
who
had
made
him
what
he
was
in
this
case
however
the
protocol
embodied
something
more
than
the
traditional
formality
and
its
hackneyed
phrases
borrowed
a
special
meaning
from
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
amon
who
had
been
insulted
and
proscribed
by

all
this
was
as

an

who
was
continually
looking

very
severe
edict

effect

relax
the
severity
of

view
alienates

still
youthful
breathes
an
air

melancholy

expression

is
somewhat
rare

the
pharaohs

best
period
the
thin
and
straight
nose
is
well
set

the
face
the
elongated
eyes
have
somewhat
heavy
lids
the
large
fleshy
lips
slightly
contracted
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
are
cut
with
a
sharpness
that
gives
them
singular
vigour
and
the
firm
and
finely
modelled
chin
loses
little
of
its
form
from
the
false
beard
depending
from
it
every
detail
is
treated
with
such
freedom
that
one
would
think
the
sculptor
must
have
had
some
soft
material
to
work
upon
rather
than
a
rock
almost
hard
enough
to
defy
the
chisel
the
command
over
it
is
so
complete

the
difficulty
of
the
work
is
forgotten

the
perfection

the

have
visited

experienced
here
more
difficulties
than
on

it
was
nevertheless
brought
to
an
equally
triumphant
conclusion
those
of
their
adversaries
who
had
offered
an
obstinate
resistance
were
transported
into
other
lands
and
the
rebel
cities
were
either
razed
to
the

given
to
the

the
inhabitants
having
taken
refuge
in
the

where
they
were
in

perishing
from

have

of
their
chiefs
associated
doubtless
with
the
phoenicians
presented
themselves
before
the
pharaoh
at
thebes
egypt
was
maintaining
therefore
its
ascendency
or
at
least
appearing
to
maintain
it
in
those
regions
where
the
kings
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
had
ruled
after
the
campaigns
of
thûtmosis
thûtmosis
and
amenothes
ii
its
influence
nevertheless
was
not
so
undisputed
as
in
former
days
not
that
the
egyptian
soldiers
were
less
valiant
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
another
power
had
risen
up
alongside
them
whose
armies
were
strong
enough
to
encounter
them
on
the
field
of
battle
and
to
obtain
a
victory
over
them
beyond
naharaim
in
the
deep
recesses
of
the
amanus
and
taurus
there
had
lived
for
no
one
knows
how
many
centuries
the
rude
and
warlike
tribes
of
the
khâti
related
not
so
much
to
the
semites
of
the
syrian
plain
as
to
the
populations
of
doubtful
race
and
language
who
occupied
the
upper
basins
of
the
halys
and
euphrates
the
chaldæan
conquest
had
barely
touched
them
the
egyptian
campaign
had
not
more
effect
and
thûtmosis
iii
himself
after
having
crossed
their
frontiers
and
sacked
several
of
their
towns
made
no
serious
pretence
to
reckon
them
among
his
subjects
their
chiefs
were
accustomed
like
their
neighbours
to
use
for
correspondence
with
other
countries
the
cuneiform
mode
of
writing
they
had
among
them
therefore
for
this
purpose
a
host
of
scribes
interpreters
and
official
registrars
of
events
such
as
we
find
to
have
accompanied
the
sovereigns
of
assyria
and
babylon
these
chiefs
were
accustomed
to
send
from
time
to
time
a
present
to
the
pharaoh
which
the
latter
was
pleased
to
regard
as
a
tribute
or
they
would
offer
perhaps
one
of
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
the
king
at
thebes
and
after
the
marriage
show
themselves
anxious
to
maintain
good
faith
with
their
halévy
asserts
that
the
khâti
were
semites
and
bases
his
assertion
on
materials
of
the
assyrian
period
thés
khâti
absorbed
in
syria
by
the
semites
with
whom
they
were
blended
appear
to
have
been
by
origin
a
people
a
letter
from
the
king
of
the
khâti
to
the
pharaoh
amenothes
iv
is
written
in
cuneiform
writing
and
in
a
semitic
language
it
has
been
thought
that
other
documents
drawn
up
in
a
language
and
coming
from
mitanni
and
arzapi
contain
a
dialect
of
the
hittite
speech
or
that
language
itself
a
of
books
attached
to
the
person
of
the
hittite
king
khatusaru
is
named
amongst
the
dead
found
on
the
field
of
battle
at
qodshû
it
is
thus
perhaps
we
must
understand
the
mention
of
tribute
from
the
khâti
in
the
of
thûtmosis
in
the
year
also
in
the
year
xl
one
of
the
tel
letters
refers
to
presents
of
this
kind
which
the
king
of
khâti
addresses
to
amenôthes
iv
to
celebrate
his
enthronement
and
to
ask
him
to
maintain
with
himself
the
traditional
good
relations
of
their
two
families
they
had
moreover
commercial
relations
with
egypt
and
furnished
it
with
cattle
chariots
and
those
splendid
cappadocian
horses
whose
breed
was
celebrated
down
to
the
greek
period
they
were
already
indeed
people
of
consideration
their
territory
was
so
extensive
that
the
contemporaries
of
thutmosis
iii
called
them
the
greater
khâti
and
the
epithet
which
the
chancellors
of
the
pharaohs
added
to
their
name
only
shows
by
its
virulence
the
impression
which
they
had
produced
upon
the
mind
of
their
adversaries
the
horses
of
the
khâti
were
called
strong
vigorous
as
also
their
bulls
the
king
of
alasia
while
offering
to
amenôthes
iii
a
profitable
speculation
advises
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
king
of
the
khâti
or
with
the
king
of
sangar
and
thus
furnishes
proof
that
the
egyptians
held
constant
commercial
relations
with
the
khâti
de
rougé
suggested
that
khâti
was
the
name
of
the
hittites
of
hebron
the
expression
the
great
has
been
compared
with
that
of
khanirabbat
the
great
which
in
the
assyrian
texts
would
seem
to
designate
a
part
of
cappadocia
in
which
the
province
of
miliddi
occurs
and
the
identification
of
the
two
has
found
an
ardent
defender
in
max
millier
until
further
light
is
thrown
upon
it
the
most
probable
reading
of
the
word
is
not
but
the
name
is
possibly
preserved
in
julbat
which
the
arab
geographers
applied
in
the
middle
ages
to
a
province
situated
in
lesser
armenia
their
type
of
face
distinguishes
them
clearly
from
the
nations
conterminous
with
them
on
the
south
the
egyptian
draughtsmen
represented
them
as
squat
and
short
in
stature
though
vigorous
and
with
broad
and
full
shoulders
in
youth
but
as
inclined
frequently
to
obesity
in
old
age
the
head
is
long
and
heavy
the
forehead
flattened
the
chin
moderate
in
size
the
nose
prominent
the
eyebrows
and
cheeks
projecting
the
eyes
small
oblique
and
the

and
usually
framed
in
by
two
deep
wrinkles
the

colour
is
a
yellowish

reddish
white
but
clearer

of
the

or
the

illustration
three
heads
of
hittite
soldiers
drawn
by
from
a

their
ordinary
costume
consisted
sometimes
of
a

with
short
sleeves
sometimes
of
a
sort
of
more
or
less
ample
according
to
the
rank
of
the
individual
wearing
it
and
bound
round
the
waist
by
a
belt
to
these
they
added
a
scanty
mantle
red
or
blue
fringed
like
that
of
the
chaldæans
which
they
passed
over
the
left
shoulder
and
brought
back
under
the
right
so
as
to
leave
the
latter
exposed
they
wore
shoes
with
thick
soles
turning
up
distinctly
at
the
toes
and
they
encased
their
hands
in
gloves
reaching
halfway
up
the
arm
this
characteristic
is
found
on
the
majority
of
the
monuments
which
the
peoples
of
asia
minor
have
left
to
us
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
striking
indications
of
the
northern
origin
of
the
khâti
the
egyptian
artists
and
modern
draughtsmen
have
often
neglected
it
and
the
majority
of
them
have
represented
the
khâti
without
shoes
they
shaved
off
both
moustache
and
beard
but
gave
free
growth
to
their
hair
which
they
divided
into
two
or
three
locks
and
allowed
to
fall
upon
their
backs
and
breasts
the
which
was
distinctive
of
royalty
was
a
tall
pointed
hat
resembling
to
some
extent
the
white
crown
of
the
pharaohs
the
dress
of
the
people
taken
all
together
was
of
better
and
thicker
material
than
that
of
the
syrians
or
egyptians
the
mountains
and
elevated
plateaus
which
they
inhabited
were
subject
to
extraordinary
vicissitudes
of
heat
and
cold
if
the
summer
burnt
up
everything
the
winter

here
with
an
extreme
rigour

clothing
and
footgear
had
to
be
seen
to
if
the
snow
and
the
icy
winds
of

were
to
be
resisted
the
character
of
their
towns
and
the
domestic
life
of
their
nobles
and
the
common
people
can
only
be
guessed
at
some
at
least
of
the
peasants
must
have
sheltered
themselves
in
villages
half
underground
similar
to
those
which
are
still
to
be
found
in
this
region
the
and
the
nobles
had
adopted
for
the
most
part
the
chaldæan
or
egyptian
manners
and
customs
in
use
among
the
semites
of
syria
as
to
their
religion
they
reverenced
a
number
of
secondary
deities
who
had
their
abode
in
the
tempest
in
the
clouds
the
sea
the
rivers
the
springs
the
mountains
and
the
forests
above
this
crowd
there
were
several
sovereign
divinities
of
the
thunder
or
the
air
and
of
which
the
chief
was
called
khâti
and
was
considered
to
be
the
father
of
the
nation
they
ascribed
to
all
their
deities
a
warlike
and
savage
character
the
egyptians
pictured
some
of
them
as
a
kind
of
râ
others
as
representing
sit
or
rather
sûtkhû
that
patron
of
the
hyksôs
which
was
identified
by
them
with
sit
every
town
had
its
tutelary
heroes
of
whom
they
were
accustomed
to
speak
as

of
sarsu

the
goddesses
in
their
eyes
also
became
astartés
and
this
one
fact
suggests
that
these
deities
were
like
their
phoenician
and
canaanite
sisters
of
a
double
nature
in
one
aspect
chaste
fierce
and
warlike
and
in
another
lascivious
and
pacific
one
god

called

qaui
and
khepa
the
cilician
inscriptions
of
the
period
reveal
the
existence
in
this
region
of
a
god
rho
rhos
did
this
god
exist
among
the
khâti
and
did
the
similarity
of
the
pronunciation
of
it
to
that
of
the
god
râ
suggest
to
the
egyptians
the
existence
of
a
similar
god
among
these
people
or
did
they
simply
translate
into
their
language
the
name
of
the
hittite
god
representing
the
sun
the
names
mauru
and
qaui
are
deduced
from
the
forms
maurusaru
and
qauisaru
which
were
borne
by
the
khâti
qaui

probably
the
eponymous
hero

we
know
as
little
about

as
about

we
may
believe
however
that
it
was
feudal
in
character
and
that
every
clan
had
its
hereditary
chief

its
proper

the

rendered

depended

are
described
by

these
festivals
were
very
ancient
and
their
institution
if
not
the
method

celebrating

may
go

the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
similar
feudal
organisation
from
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
is
furnished
by
a

he
relates

one
of

the
khâti
had
given

still
they
were
not

the
elements

an
excellent

superior
both
in
quality
and
quantity
to
any
which

thûtmosîs
iii
and
amenôthes
ii
were
not
able
to
avail
themselves
properly
of
the
latent
forces
around
them
it
was
owing
probably
to
the
feebleness
of
their
character
or
to
the
turbulence
of
their
barons
that
we
must
ascribe
the
poor
part
they
played
in
the
revolutions
of
the
eastern
world
at
this
time
the
establishment
of
a
strong
military
power
on
their
southern
frontier
was
certain
moreover
to
be
anything
but
pleasing
to
them
if
they
preferred
not
to
risk
everything
by
entering
into
a
great
struggle
with
the
invaders
they
could
without
compromising
themselves
too
much
harass
them
with
sudden
attacks
and
intrigue
in
an
underhand
way
against
them
to
their
own
profit
generals
were
accustomed
to
punish
one
after
the
other
these
bands
of
invading
tribes
and
the
sculptors
duly
recorded
their
names
on
a
pylon
at
thebes
among
those
of
the
conquered
nations
but
these
disasters
had
little
effect
in
restraining
the
hittites
they
continued
in
spite
of
them
to
march
southward
and
the
letters
from
the
egyptian
governors
record
their
progress
year
after
year
they
had
a
hand
in
all
the
plots
which
were
being
hatched
among
the
syrians
and
all
the
disaffected
who
wished
to
be
free
from
foreign
oppression
such
as
abdashirti
and
his
son
azîru
addressed
themselves
to
them
for
help
in
the
way
of
chariots
and
men
azîru
defends
himself
in
one
of
his
letters
against
the
accusation
of
having
received
four
messengers
from
the
king
of
the
khâti
while
he
refused
to
receive
those
from
egypt
the
complicity
of
aziru
with
the
khâti
is
denounced
in
an
appeal
from
the
inhabitants
of
tunipa
in
a
mutilated
letter
an
unknown
person
calls
attention
to
the
negotiations
which
a
prince
had
entered
into
with
the
king
of
the
khâti
even
inthe
time
of
amenôfches
iii
they
had
endeavoured
to
reap
profit
from
the
discords
of
mitanni
and
had
asserted
their
supremacy
over
it
dushratta
however
was
able
to
defeat
one
of
their
chiefs
repulsed
on
this
side
they
fell
back
upon
that
part
of
naharaim
lying
between
the
euphrates
and
orontes
and
made
themselves
masters
of
one
town
after
another
in
spite
of
the
despairing
appeals
of
the
conquered
to
the
theban
king
from
the
accession
of
khûniatonû
they
set
to
work
to
annex
the
countries
of
nukhassi
nîi
tunipa
and
zinzauru
they
looked
with
covetous
eyes
upon
phoenicia
and
were
already
menacing
the
religious
confusion
in
egypt
under
tûtankhamon
and
aî
left
them
a
free
field
for
their
ambitions
and
when
harmhabî
ventured
to
cross
to
the
east
of
the
isthmus
he
found
them
definitely
installed
in
the
region
stretching
from
the
mediterranean
and
the
lebanon
to
the
euphrates
their
then
reigning
prince
sapalulu
appeared
to
have
been
the
founder
of
a
new
dynasty
he
united
the
forces
of
the
country
in
a
solid
body
and
was
within
a
little
of
making
a
single
state
out
of
all
northern
syria
sapalulu
has
the
same
name
as
that
wo
meet
with
later
on
in
the
country
of
patin
in
the
time
of
salmanasar
viz
sapalulme
it
is
known
to
us
only
from
a
treaty
with
the
khâti
which
makes
him
coeval
with
ramses
it
was
with
him
probably
that
harmhabî
had
to
deal
in
his
syrian
campaigns
the
limit
of
his
empire
towards
the
south
is
gathered
in
a
measure
from
what
we
know
of
the
wars
of
seti
with
the
khâti
all
naharaim
had
submitted
to
him
zahi
alasia
and
the
amurru
had
passed
under
his
government
from
that
of
the
pharaohs
carchemish
tunipa
nîi
hamath
figured
among
his
royal
cities
and
qodshû
was
the
defence
of
his
southern
frontier
his
progress
towards
the
east
was
not
less
considerable
mitanni
arzapi
and
the
principalities
of
the
euphrates
as
far
as
the
balikh
possibly
even
to
the
khabur
paid
him
homage
beyond
this
assyria
and
chaldæa
barred
his
way
here
as
on
his
other
frontiers
fortune
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
most
formidable
powers
of
the
asiatic
world
the
text
of
the
poem
of
pentaûîrît
mentions
among
the
countries
confederate
with
the
khâti
all
naharaim
that
is
to
say
the
country
on
either
side
of
the
euphrates
embracing
mitanni
and
the
principalities
named
in
the
amarna
correspondence
and
in
addition
some
provinces
whose
sites
have
not
yet
been
discovered
but
which
may
be
placed
without
much
risk
of
error
to
the
north
of
the
taurus
the
latter
prince
was
obliged
to
capture
qodshû
and
to
conquer
the
people
of
the
lebanon
had
he
sufficient
forces
at
his
disposal
to
triumph
over
them
or
only
enough
to
hold
his
ground
both
hypotheses
could
have
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
if
each
one
of
these
great
powers
confiding
in
its
own
resources
had
attacked
him
separately
the
amorites
the
people
of
zahi
alasia
and
naharaim
together
with
recruits
from
hittite
tribes
would
then
have
put
him
in
a
position
to
resist
and
even
to
carry
off
victory
with
a
high
hand
in
the
final
struggle
but
an
alliance
between
assyria
or
babylon
and
thebes
was
always
possible
there
had
been
such
things
before
in
the
time
of
iv
and
in
that
of
amenôthes
but
they
were
lukewarm
agreements
and
their
effect
was
not
much
to
boast
of
for
the
two
parties
to
the
covenant
had
then
no
common
enemy
to
deal
with
and
their
mutual
interests
were
not
therefore
bound
up
with
their
united
action
the
circumstances
were
very
different
now
the
rapid
growth
of
a
nascent
kingdom
the
restless
spirit
of
its
people
its
trespasses
on
domains
in
which
the
older
powers
had
been
accustomed
to
hold
the
upper
hand
did
not
all
this
tend
to
transform
the
convention
more
commercial
than
military
with
which
up
to
this
time
they
had
been
content
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
treaty
if
they
decided
to
act
in
concert
how
could
sapalulu
or
his
successors
seeing
that
he
was
obliged
to
defend
himself
on
two
frontiers
at
the
same
moment
muster
sufficient
resources
to
withstand
the
double
assault
the
hittites
as
we
know
them
more
especially
from
the
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
might
be
regarded
as
the
lords
only
of
northern
syria
and
their
power
be
measured
merely
by
the
extent
of
territory
which
they
occupied
to
the
south
of
the
taurus
and
on
the
two
banks
of
the
middle
euphrates
but
this
does
not
by
any
means
represent
the
real
facts
this
was
but
the
half
of
their
empire
the
rest
extended
to
the
westward
and
northward
beyond
the
mountains
into
that
region
known
afterwards
as
asia
minor
in
which
egyptian
tradition
had
from
ancient
times
confused
some
twenty
nations
under
the
common
vague
epithet
of
official
language
still
employed
it
as
a
convenient
and
comprehensive
term
but
the
voyages
of
the
phoenicians
and
the
travels
of
the
messengers
as
well
as
probably
the
maritime
commerce
of
the
merchants
of
the
delta
had
taught
the
scribes
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
to
make
distinctions
among
these
nations
which
they
had
previously
summed
up
in
one
the

to
be
found
there
as
well
as
the
danauna

lay

of

of

of

tribes
we
have
up
to
the
present
no
means
of
knowing
anything
with
certainty
asia
minor
furthermore
is
divided
into
two
regions
so
distinctly
separated
by
nature
as
well
as
by
races
that
one
would
be
almost
inclined
to
regard
them
as
two
countries
foreign
to
each
other
the
luku
luka
are
mentioned
in
the
amarna
correspondence
under
the
form
lukki
as

and
highway
robbers
the
identity
of
these
people
with
the
lycians
i
hold
as
well
established
the
danauna
are
mentioned
along
with
the
luku
in
the
amarna
correspondence
the
termination
of
this
word
appears
to
be
the
ending
in

in
asiatic
names
like
lykaôn
by
the
side
of
lykos
kataôn
by
the
side
of
kêtis
and
while
the
form
of
the
name
danaos
is
preserved
in
greek
legend
danaôn
is
found
only
on
oriental
monuments
the
danauna
came
their
islands
that
is
to
say
from
the
coasts
of
asia
minor
or
from
greece
the
term
not
being
pressed
too
literally
as
the
egyptians
were
inclined
to
call
all
distant
lands
situated
to
the
north
beyond
the
mediterranean
sea
de
rougé
and
chabas
were
inclined
to
identify
the
shardana
with
the
sardes
and
the

of
sardinia
unger
made
them
out
to
be
the
khartanoi
of
libya
and
was
followed
by
brugsch
max
müller
revived
the
hypotheses
of
de
rougé
and
chabas
and
saw
in
them
bands
from
the
italian
island
i
am
still
persuaded
as
i
was
years
ago
that
they
were
asiatics
the

gave
its

bounded
towards

by

appropriately
applied

feet
over

it
still

in
old
days
something
of
its
languishing
energy

out
flames
at

above
the
sacred

which
clothed
its
slopes
the

their
sources
in
the

just
described
have
not
all
succeeded
in
piercing
the
obstacles
which
separate
them
from

the

their
way
into
the

the

is
nothing

an
extension

the

primitive
civilization
analogous
to
that
of

formed
the
only
materials
for

introduced

we
can
trace
their
progressive
employment
to
the
gradual
exclusion
of
the
older
implements
these
ancient
trojans
used
copper
and
we
encounter
only
rarely
a
kind
of
bronze
in
which
the
proportion
of
tin
was
too
slight
to
give
the
requisite
hardness
to
the

the

are
sometimes
of
a
not
ungraceful
form
their
pottery
was
made
by
hand
and
was
not
painted

they

gave

it
a
fine
lustre
by
means
of
a
other
peoples
of
uncertain
origin
but
who
had
attained
a
civilization
as
advanced
as
that
of
the
trojans
were
the
maeonians
the
leleges
and
the
carians
who
had
their
abode
to
the
south
of
troy
and
of
the
mysians
the
maeonians
held
sway
in
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
hermos
cayster
and
maaander
they
were
divided
into
several
branches
such
as
the
lydians
the
tyrseni
the
torrhebi
and
the
shardana
but
their
most
ancient
traditions
looked
back
with
pride
to
a
flourishing
state
to
which
as
they
alleged
they
had
all
belonged
long
ago
on
the
slopes
of
mount
sipylos
between
the
valley
of
the
hermos
and
the
gulf
of
smyrna
the
traditional
capital
of
this
kingdom
was
magnesia
the
most
ancient
of
cities
the
residence
of
tantalus
the
father
of
niobe
and
the
pelopidae
the
leleges
rise
up
before
us
from
many
points
at
the
same
time
but
always
connected
with
the
most
ancient
memories
of
greece
and
asia
the
majority
of
the
strongholds
on
the
trojan
coast
belonged
to
them
such
as
antandros
and
gargara
and
pedasos
on
the
satniois
boasted
of
having
been
one
of
their
colonies
while
several
other
towns
of
the
same
name
but
very
distant
from
each
other
enable
us
to
form
some
idea
of
the
extent
of
their
migrations
according
to
the
scholiast
on
nicander
the
word
signified
probably
in
the
language
of
the
leleges
we
know
up
to
the
present
of
four
pedasi
or
pedasa
the
first
in
messenia
which
later
on
took
the
name
of
methône
the
second
in
the
troad
on
the
banks
of
the
satniois
the
third
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cyzicus
and
the
fourth
in
caria
in
the
time
of
strabo
ruined
tombs
and
deserted
sites
of
cities
were
shown
in
caria
which
the
natives
regarded
as
lelegia
that
is
abode
of
the
leleges
the
carians
were
dominant
in
the
southern
angle
of
the
peninsula
and
in
the
ægean
islands
and
the
lycians
lay
next
them
on
the
east
and
were
sometimes
confounded
with
them
one
of
the
most
powerful
tribes
of
the
carians
the
tremilse
were
in
the
eyes
of
the
greeks
hardly
to
be
separated
from
the
mountainous
district
which
they
knew
as
lycia
proper
while
other
tribes
extended
as
far
as
the
halys
a
district
of
the
troad
to
the
south
of
mount
ida
was
called
lycia
and
there
was
a
lycaonia
on
both
sides
of
the
middle
taurus
while
attica
had
its
lycia
and
crete
its
lycians
these
three
nations
the
lycians
carians
and
leleges
were
so
entangled
together
from
their
origin
that
no
one
would
venture
now
to
trace
the
lines
of
demarcation
between
them
and
we
are
often
obliged
to
apply
to
them
collectively
what
can
be
appropriately
ascribed
to
only
one
how
far
the
hittite
power
extended
in
the
first
years
of
its
expansion
we
have
now
hardly
the
means
of
knowing
it
would
appear
that
it
took
within
its
scope
on
the
the
cilician
plain
and
the
undulating
region
bordering
on
it
that
of
qodi
the
prince
of
the
latter
district
if
not
his
vassal
was
at
least
the
colleague
of
the
king
of
the
khâti
and
he
acted
in
concert
with
him
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
the
country
of
qidi
qadi
qodi
has
been
connected
by
chabas
with
galilee
and
brugsch
adopted
the
identification
max
müller
identified
it
with
phoenicia
i
think
the
name
served
to
designate
the
cilician
coast
and
plain
from
the
mouth
of
the
orontes
and
the
country
which
was
known
in
the
period
by
the
name
kêtis
and
kataonia
it
embraced
also
the
upper
basin
of
the
pyramos
and
its
affluents
as
well
as
the
regions
situated
between
the
euphrates
and
the
halys
but
its
frontier
in
this
direction
was
continually
fluctuating
and
our
researches
fail
to
follow
it
it
is
somewhat
probable
that
it
extended
considerably
towards
the
west
and
in
the
direction
of
the
ægean
sea
the
forests
and
escarpments
of
lycaonia
and
the
desolate
steppes
of
the
central
plateau
have
always
presented
a
barrier
difficult
to
surmount
by
any
invader
from
the
east
if
the
khâti
at
that
period
attacked
it
in
front
or
by
a
flank
movement
the
assault
must
rather
have
been
of
the
nature
of
a
hurried
reconnaissance
or
of
a
raid
than
of
a
methodically
conducted
campaign
the
idea
of
a
hittite
empire
extending
over
almost
all
asia
minor
was
advanced
by
sayce
they
must
have
preferred
to
obtain
possession
of
the
valleys
of
the
thermodon
and
the
iris
which
were
rich
in
mineral
wealth
and
from
which
they
could
have
secured
an
inexhaustible
revenue
the
extraction
and
working
of
metals
in
this
region
had
attracted
thither
from
time
immemorial
merchants
from
neighbouring
and
distant
countries
at
first
from
the
south
to
supply
the
needs
of
syria
chaldæa
and
egypt
then
from
the
west
for
the
necessities
of
the
countries
on
the
ægean
the
roads
which
starting
from
the
archipelago
on
the
one
hand
or
the
euphrates
on
the
other
met
at
this
point
fell
naturally
into
one
and
thus
formed
a
continuous
route
along
which
the
caravans
of
commerce
as
well
as
warlike
expeditions
might
henceforward
pass
starting
from
the
cultivated
regions
of
mæonia
the
road
proceeded
up
the
valley
of
the
hermos
from
west
to
east
then
scaling
the
heights
of
the
central
plateau
and
taking
a
direction
more
and
more
to
the
it
reached
the
fords
of
the
halys
crossing
this
river
twice
for
the
first
time
at
a
point
about
the
length
of
its
course
and
for
the
second
at
a
short
distance
from
its
source
it
made
an
abrupt
turn
towards
the
taurus
and
joined
at
melitene
the
routes
leading
to
the
upper
tigris
to
nisibis
to
singara
and
to
old
assur
and
connecting
further
down
beyond
the
mountainous
region
under
the
walls
of
carchemish
with
the
roads
which
led
to
the
nile
and
to
the
cities
on
the
persian
gulf
the
very
early
existence
of
this
road
which
partly
coincides
with
the
royal
route
of
the
persian
achemenids
was
proved
by
kiepert
there
were
other
and
shorter
routes
if
we
think
only
of
the
number
of
miles
from
the
hermos
in
pisidia
or
lycaonia
across
the
central
steppe
and
through
the
cilician
gates
to
the
meeting
of
the
ways
at
carchemish
but
they
led
through
wretched
regions
without
industries
almost
without
tillage
and
inhospitable
alike
to
man
and
beast
and
they
were
ventured
on
only
by
those
who
aimed
at
trafficking
among
the
populations
who
lived
in
their
neighbourhood
the
khâti
from
the
time
even
when
they
were
enclosed
among
the
fastnesses
of
the
taurus
had
within
their
control
the
most
important
section
of
the
great
land
route
which
served
to
maintain
regular
relations
between
the
ancient
kingdoms
of
the
east
and
the
rising
states
of
the
ægean
and
whosoever
would
pass
through
their
country
had
to
pay
them
toll
the
conquest
of
naharaim
in
giving
them
control
of
a
new
section
placed
almost
at
their
discretion
the
whole
traffic
between
chaldæa
and
egypt
from
the
time
of
thûtmosis
iii
caravans
employed
in
this
traffic
accomplished
the
greater
part
of
their
journey
in
territories
depending
upon
babylon
assyria
or
memphis
and
enjoyed
thus
a
relative
security
the
terror
of
the
pharaoh
protected
the
travellers
even
when
they
were
no
longer
in
his
domains
and
he
saved
them
from
the
flagrant
exactions
made
upon
them
by
princes
who
called
themselves
his
brothers
or
were
actually
his
vassals
but
the
time
had
now
come
when
merchants
had
to
encounter
between
qodshu
and
the
banks
of
the
khabur
a
sovereign
owing
no
allegiance
to
any
one
and
who
would
tolerate
no
foreign
interference
in
his
territory
from
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
with
the
khâti
egypt
could
communicate
with
the
cities
of
the
lower
euphrates
only
by
the
wadys
of
the
arabian
desert
which
were
always
dangerous
and
difficult
for
large
convoys
and
its
commercial
relations
with
chaldæa
were
practically
brought
thus
to
a
standstill
and
as
a
consequence
the
manufactures
which
fed
this
trade
being
reduced
to
a
limited
production
the
fiscal
receipts
arising
from
it
experienced
a
sensible
diminution
when
peace
was
restored
matters
fell
again
into
their
old
groove
with
certain
reservations
to
the
khâti
of
some
common
privileges
egypt
which
had
formerly
possessed
these
to
her
own
advantage
now
bore
the
burden
of
them
and
the
indirect
tribute
which
she
paid
in
this
manner
to
her
rivals
furnished
them
with
arms
to
fight
her
in
case
she
should
endeavour
to
free
herself
from
the
imposition
all
the
peoples
of
the
peninsula
of
asia
minor
were
of
an
adventurous
and
warlike
temperament
they
were
always
willing
to
set
out
on
an
expedition
under
the
leadership
of
some
chief
of
noble
family
or
renowned
for
valour
sometimes
by
sea
in
their
light
craft
which
would
bring
them
unexpectedly
to
the
nearest
point
of
the
syrian
coast
sometimes
by
land
in
companies
of
and
charioteers
they
were
frequently
fortunate
enough
to
secure
plenty
of
booty
and
return
with
it
to
their
homes
safe
and
sound
but
as
frequently
they
would
meet
with
reverses
by
falling
into
some
ambuscade
in
such
a
case
their
conqueror
would
not
put
them
to
the
sword
or
sell
them
as
slaves
but
would
promptly
incorporate
them
into
his
army
thus
making
his
captives
into
his
soldiers
the
king
of
the
khâti
was
able
to
make
use
of
them
without
difficulty
for
his
empire
was
conterminous
on
the
west
and
north
with
some
of
their
native
lands
and
he
had
often
whole
regiments
of
them
in
his
army
mysians
lycians
people
of
augarît
of
ilion
and
of
pedasos
the
country
of
augarît
ugarît
is
mentioned
on
several
occasions
in
the
tel
correspondence
the
name
has
been
wrongly
associated
with
caria
it
has
been
placed
by
max
miiller
well
within
naharaim
to
the
east
of
the
orontes
between
khalybôn
aleppo
and
apamoea
the
writer
confusing
it
with
akaiti
named
in
the
campaign
of
amenôthes
ii
i
am
not
sure
about
the
site
but
its
association
in
the
amarna
letters
with
gugu
and
khanigalbat
inclines
me
to
place
it
beyond
the
northern
slopes
of
the
taurus
possibly
on
the
banks
of
the
halys
or
of
the
upper
euphrates
the
name
of
this
people
was
read
eiûna
by
champollion
who
identified
it
with
the
ionians
this
reading
and
identification
were
adopted
by
lenormant
and
by
max
müller
chabas
hesitates
between
eiûna
and
maiûna
ionia
and
moonia
and
brugsch
read
it
malunna
the
reading
iriûna
iliûna
seems
to
me
the
only
possible
one
and
the
identification
with
ilion
as
well
owing
to
its
association
with
the
dardanians
mysians
and
ilion
i
think
it
answers
to
the
pedasos
on
the
satniois
near
troy
the
revenue
of
the
provinces
taken
from
egypt
and
the
products
of
his
tolls
furnished
him
with
abundance
of
means
for
obtaining
recruits
from
among
them
all
these
things
contributed
to
make
the
power
of
the
khâti
so
considerable
that
harmhabî
when
he
had
once
tested
it
judged
it
prudent
not
to
join
issues
with
them
he
concluded
with
sapalulu
a
treaty
of
peace
and
friendship
which
leaving
the
two
powers
in
possession
respectively
of
the
territory
each
then
occupied
gave
legal
sanction
to
the
extension
of
the
sphere
of
the
khâti
at
the
expense
of
egypt
syria
continued
to
consist
of
two
almost
equal
parts
stretching
from
byblos
to
the
sources
of
the
jordan
and
damascus
the
northern
portion
formerly
tributary
to
egypt
became
a
hittite
possession
while
the
southern
consisting
of
phoenicia
and
canaan
which
the
pharaoh
had
held
for
a
long
time
with
a
more
effective
authority
and
had
more
fully
occupied
was
retained
for
egypt
de
rougé
and
the
egyptologists
who
followed
him
thought
at
first
that
the
troops
designated
in
the
egyptian
texts
as
lycians
mysians
dardanians
were
the
national
armies
of
these
nations
each
one
commanded
by
its
king
who
had
hastened
from
asia
minor
to
succour
their
ally
the
king
of
the
khâti
i
now
think
that
those
were
bands
of
adventurers
consisting
of
soldiers
belonging
to
these
nations
who
came
to
put
themselves
at
the
service
of
civilized
monarchs
as
the
oarians
ionians
and
the
greeks
of
various
cities
did
later
on
the
individuals
whom
the
texts
mention
as
their
princes
were
not
the
kings
of
these
nations
but
the
warrior
chiefs
to
which
each
band
gave
obedience
it
is
not
certain
that
harmhabî
was
the
pharaoh
with
whom
sapalulu
entered
into
treaty
and
it
might
be
insisted
with
some
reason
that
ramses
was
the
party
to
it
on
the
side
of
egypt
but
this
hypothesis
is
rendered
less
probable
by
the
fact
of
the
extremely
short
reign
of
the
latter
pharaoh
i
am
inclined
to
think
as
max
miiller
has
supposed
that
the
passage
in
the
of
ramses
ii
with
the
prince
of
the
khâti
which
speaks
of
a
treaty
concluded
with
sapalulu
looks
back
to
the
time
of
ramses
predecessor
harmhabî
this
follows
from
the
situation
of
the
two
empires
as
indicated
in
the
account
of
the
campaign
of
seti
in
his
first
year
the
king
after
having
defeated
the
nomads
of
the
arabian
desert
passed
on
without
further
fighting
into
the
country
of
the
amûrrû
and
the
regions
of
the
lebanon
which
fact
seems
to
imply
the
submission
of
kharû
max
miiller
was
the
first
discern
clearly
this
part
of
the
history
of
egyptian
conquest
he
appears
however
to
have
circumscribed
somewhat
too
strictly
the
dominion
of
harmhabî
in
assigning
carmel
as
its
limit
the
list
of
the
nations
of
the
north
who
yielded
or
are
alleged
to
have
yielded
submission
to
harmhabî
were
traced
on
the
first
pylon
of
this
monarch
at
karnak
and
on
its
adjoining
walls
among
others
the
names
of
the
khâti
and
of
arvad
are
to
be
read
there
this
could
have
been
but
a
provisional
arrangement
if
thebes
had
not
altogether
renounced
the
hope
of
repossessing
some
day
the
lost
conquests
of
thûtmosis
the
khâti
drawn
by
the
same
instinct
which
had
urged
them
to
cross
their
frontiers
towards
the
south
were
not
likely
to
be
content
with
less
than
the
expulsion
of
the
egyptians
from
syria
and
the
absorption
of
the
whole
country
into
the
hittite
dominion
peace
was
maintained
during
lifetime
we
know
nothing
of
egyptian
affairs
during
the
last
years
of
his
reign
his
rule
may
have
come
to
an
end
owing
to
some
court
intrigue
or
he
may
have
had
no
male
heir
to
follow
him
ramses
who
succeeded
him
did
not
belong
to
the
royal
line
or
was
only
remotely
connected
with
it
it
would
appear
from
an
ostracon
in
the
british
museum
that
the
year
xxi
follows
after
the
year
vii
of
reign
it
is
possible
that
the
year
xxi
may
belong
to
one
of
successors
seti
or
ramses
for
example
the
efforts
to
connect
ramses
with
a
family
of
semitic
origin
possibly
the
themselves
have
not
been
successful
everything
goes
to
prove
that
the
ramses
family
was
and
considered
itself
to
be
of
egyptian
origin
brugsch
and
ed
meyer
were
inclined
to
see
in
ramses
a
younger
brother
of
harmhabî
this
hypothesis
has
nothing
either
for
or
against
it
up
to
the
present
he
was
already
an
old
man
when
he
ascended
the
throne
and
we
ought
perhaps
to
identify
him
with
one
or
other
of
the
ramses
who
flourished
under
the
last
pharaohs
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
perhaps
the
one
who
governed
thebes
under
khûniatonû
or
another
who
began
but
never
finished

he
had
held
important
offices
under
harmhabî
and
had
obtained
in
marriage
for
his
son
seti
the
hand
of
tuîa
who
of
all
the
royal
family
possessed
the
strongest
rights
to
the
crown
this
tel
ramses
is
perhaps
identical
with
the
theban
one
he
may
have
followed
his
master
to
his
new
capital
and
have
had
a
tomb
dug
for
himself
there
which
he
subsequently
abandoned
on
the
death
of
khûniatonû
in
order
to
return
to
thebes
with
tûtankhamon
and
aï
the
fact
that
the
marriage
was
celebrated
under
the
auspices
of
harmhabî
and
that
consequently
ramses
must
have
occupied
an
important
position
at
the
court
of
that
prince
is
proved
by
the
appearance
of
ramses
son
of
tuîa
as
early
as
the
first
year
of
seti
among
the
ranks
of
the
combatants
in
the
war
carried
on
by
that
prince
against
the
tihonû
even
granting
that
he
was
then
ten
years
old
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
he
must
have
been
born
before
his
grandfather
came
to
the
throne
there
is
in
the
vatican

statue

reigned
only
six
or
seven
years
and
associated
seti
with
himself
in
the
government
from
his
second
year
he
undertook
a
short
military
expedition
into
ethiopia
and
perhaps
a
raid
into
syria
and
we
find
remains
of
his
monuments
in
nubia
at
bohani
near
wady
haifa
and
at
thebes
in
the
temple
of
amon
he
began
the
great
hypostyle
hall
at
karnak
de
rougé
thinks
that
the
idea
of
building
this
was
first
conceived
under
the
xviiith
dynasty
he
displayed
little
activity
his
advanced
age
preventing
him
from
entering
on
any
serious
undertaking
but
his
accession
nevertheless
marks
an
important
date
in
the
history
of
egypt
although
harmhabî
was
distantly
connected
with
the
line
of
the
ahmessides
it
is
difficult
at
the
present
day
to
know
what
position
to
assign
him
in
the
pharaonic
lists
while
some
regard
him
as
the
last
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
others
prefer
to
place
him
at
the
head
of
the
xixth
no
such
hesitation
however
exists
with
regard
to
ramses
who
was
undoubtedly
the
founder
of
a
new
family
the
old
familiar
names
of
thûtmosis
and
amenôthes
henceforward
disappear
from
the
royal
lists
and
are
replaced
by
others
such
as
seti
mînephtah
and
especially
ramses
which
now
figure
in
them
for
the
first
time
the
princes
who
bore
these
names
showed
themselves
worthy
successors
of
those
who
had
raised
egypt
to
the
zenith
of
her
power
like
them
they
were
successful
on
the
and
like
them
they
devoted
the
best
of
the
spoil
to
building
innumerable
monuments
no
sooner
had
seti
celebrated
his
obsequies
than
he
assembled
his
army
and
set
out
for
war
it
would
appear
that
southern
syria
was
then
in
open
revolt
had
been
brought
to
his
majesty
vile
shaûsû
have
plotted
rebellion
the
chiefs
of
their
tribes
assembled
in
one
place
on
the
confines
of
kharû
have
been
smitten
with
blindness
and
with
the
spirit
of
violence
every
one
cutteth
his
it
was
imperative
to
send
succour
to
the
few
tribes
who
remained
faithful
to
prevent
them
from
succumbing
to
the
repeated
attacks
of
the
insurgents
seti
crossed
the
frontier
at
zalu
but
instead
of
pursuing
his
way
along
the
coast
he
marched
due
east
in
order
to
attack
the
shaûsû
in
the
very
heart
of
the
desert
the
road
ran
through
wide
wadys
tolerably
well
supplied
with
water
and
the
length
of
the
stages
necessarily
depended
on
the
distances
between
the
wells
this
route
was
one
frequented
in
early
times
and
its
security
was
ensured
by
a
number
of
fortresses
and
isolated
towers
built
along
it
such
as
house
of
the
lion
ait
pa
near
the
pool
of
the
same
name
the
migdol
of
the
springs
of
huzîna
the
fortress
of
uazît
the
tower
of
the
brave
and
the
migdol
of
seti
at
the
pools
of
absakaba
the
bedawîn
disconcerted
by
the
rapidity
of
this
movement
offered
no
serious
resistance
their
flocks
were
carried
off
their
trees
cut
down
their
harvests
destroyed
and
they
surrendered
their
strongholds
at
discretion
pushing
on
from
one
to
another
the
conqueror
soon
reached
babbîti
and
finally
pakanâna
the
pictures
of
this
campaign
and
the
inscriptions
which
explain
them
were
engraved
by
seti
on
the
outside
of
the
north
wall
of
the
great
hypostyle
hall
at
karnak
the
site
of
pakanâna
has
with
much
probability
been
fixed
at
or
to
the
south
of
hebron
brugsch
had
previously
taken
this
name
to
indicate
the
country
of
canaan
but
chabas
rightly
contested
this
view
max
millier
took
up
the
matter
afresh
he
perceived
that
we
have
here
an
allusion
to
the
first
town
encountered
by
seti
in
the
country
of
canaan
to
the
of
raphia
the
name
of
which
is
not
mentioned
by
the
egyptian
sculptor
it
seems
to
me
that
this
name
should
be
pakanâna
and
that
the
town
bore
the
same
name
as
the
country
the
latter
town
occupied
a
splendid
position
on
the
slope
of
a
rocky
hill
close
to
a
small
lake
and
defended
the
approaches
to
the
vale
of
hebron
it
surrendered
at
the
first
attack
and
by
its
fall
the
egyptians
became
possessed
of
one
of
the
richest
provinces
in
the
southern
part
of
kharû
this
result
having
been
achieved
seti
took
the
caravan
road
to
his
left
on
the
further
side
of
gaza
and
pushed
forward
at
full
speed
towards
the
hittite

some
episodes
in

first
campaign
drawn
by
boudier
from
a

it
was
probably
unprotected
by
any
troops
and
the
hittite
king
was
absent
in
some
other
part
of
his
empire
seti
pillaged
the
amurru
seized
ianuâmu
and
qodshû
by
a
sudden
attack
marched
in
an
oblique
direction
towards
the
mediterranean
forcing
the
inhabitants
of
the
lebanon
to
cut
timber
from
their
mountains
for
the
additions
which
he
was
premeditating
in
the
temple
of
the
theban
amon
and
finally
returned
by
the
coast
road
receiving
as
he
passed
through
their
territory
the
homage
of
the
phoenicians
his
entry
into
egypt
was
celebrated
by
solemn
festivities
the
nobles
priests
and
princes
of
both
south
and
north
hastened
to
meet
him
at
the
bridge
of
zalû
and
welcomed
with
their
chants
both
the
king
and
the
troops
of
captives
whom
he
was
bringing
back
for
the
service
of
his
father
amon
at
karnak
the
delight
of
his
subjects
was
but
natural
since
for
many
years
the
egyptians
bad
not
witnessed
such
a
triumph
and
they
no
doubt
believed
that
the
prosperous
era
of
thûtmosis
iii
was
about
to
return
and
that
the
wealth
of
naharaim
would
once
more
flow
into
thebes
as
of
old
their
illusion
was
for
this
initial
victory
was
followed
by
no
other
maurusaru
king
of
the
khâti
and
subsequently
his
son
mautallu
withstood
the
pharaoh
with
such
resolution
that
he
was
forced
to
treat
with
them
a
new
alliance
was
concluded
on
the
same
conditions
as
the
old
one
and
the
boundaries
of
the
two
kingdoms
remained
the
same
as
under
harmhabî
a
proof
that
neither
sovereign
had
gained
any
advantage
over
his
rival
hence
the
campaign
did
not
in
any
way
restore
egyptian
supremacy
as
had
been
hoped
at
the
moment
it
merely
served
to
strengthen
her
authority
in
those
provinces
which
the
khâti
had
failed
to
take
from
egypt
the
phoenicians
of
tyre
and
sidon
had
too
many
commercial
interests
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
to
dream
of
breaking
the
slender
tie
which
held
them
to
the
pharaoh
since
independence
or
submission
to
another
sovereign
might
have
ruined
their
trade
the
kharû
and
the
bedawîn
vanquished
wherever
they
had
ventured
to
oppose

troops

less
than
ever

syria

from

to
time
with
their
escorts
of
archers
and
chariots
to
claim
tribute
levy
taxes
to
make
peace
between
quarrelsome
vassals
or
if
the
case
required
it
to
supersede
some
insubordinate
chief
by
a
governor
of
undoubted
loyalty
in
fine
the
entire
administration
of
the
empire
was
a
continuation
of
that
of
the
preceding
century
the
peoples
of
kûsh
meanwhile
had
remained
quiet
during
the
campaign
in
syria
and
on
the
western
frontier
the
tihonû
had
suffered
so
severe
a
defeat
that
they
were
not
likely
to
recover
from
it
for
some
time
the
bands
of
pirates
shardana
and
others
who
infested
the
delta
were
hunted
down
and
the
prisoners
taken
from
among
them
were
incorporated

royal
guard
this
war
is
represented
at

the
children
of

we
gather
this
from
passages
in
the
inscriptions

the
year
onwards
in
which
ramses

boasts
that
he
has
a
number
of

prisoners

perhaps
mistaken
in

however
does
not
appear
to
have
had
a
confirmed
taste
for
war
he
showed
energy
when
occasion
required
it
and
he
knew
how
to
lead
his
soldiers
as
the
expedition
of
his
first
year
amply
proved
but
when
the
necessity
was
over
he
remained
on
the
defensive
and
made
no
further
attempt
at
conquest
by
his
own
choice
he
was
jackal
who
prowls
about
the
country
to
protect
it
rather
than
wizard
lion
marauding
abroad
by
hidden
paths
and
egypt
enjoyed
a
profound
peace
in
consequence
of
his
ceaseless
vigilance
these
phrases
are
taken
direct
from
the
inscriptions
of
seti
i
a
peaceful
policy
of
this
kind
did
not
of
course
produce
the
amount
of
spoil
and
the
endless
relays
of
captives
which
had
enabled
his
predecessors
to
raise
temples
and
live
in
great
luxury
without
overburdening
their
subjects
with
taxes
seti
was
therefore
the
more
anxious
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
develop
the
internal
wealth
of
the
country
the
mining
colonies
of
the
sinaitic
peninsula
had
never
ceased
working
since
operations
had
been
resumed
there
under
hâtshopsîtû
and
thûtmosis
but
the
output
had
lessened
during
the
troubles
under
the
heretic
kings
seti
sent
inspectors
thither
and
endeavoured
to
stimulate
the
workmen
to
their
former
activity
but
apparently
with
no
great
success
we
are
not
able
to
ascertain
if
he
continued
the
revival
of
trade
with
pûanît
inaugurated
by
harmhabî
but
at
any
rate
he
concentrated
his
attention
on
the
regions
bordering
the
red
sea
and
the
which
they
contained
those
of
btbaï
which
had
been
worked
as
early
as
the
xiith
dynasty
did
not
yield
as
much
as
they
had
done
formerly
not
that
they
were
exhausted
but
owing
to
the
lack
of
water
in
their
neighbourhood
and
along
the
routes
leading
to
them
they
were
nearly
deserted
it
was
well
known
that
they
contained
great
wealth
but
operations
could
not
be
carried
on
as
the
workmen
were
in
danger
of
dying
of
thirst
seti
despatched
engineers
to
the
spot
to
explore
the
surrounding
wadys
to
clear
the
ancient
cisterns
or
cut
others
and
to
establish
victualling
stations
at
regular
intervals
for
the
use
of
merchants
supplying
the
gangs
of
miners
with
commodities
these
stations
generally
consisted
of
square
or
rectangular
enclosures
built
of
stones
without
mortar
and
capable
of
resisting
a
prolonged
attack
the
entrance
was
by
a
narrow
doorway

in
the
interior
were
a
few

long
to

architect

of
such
confidence
in
his
powers
that
he
ventured
to
design
and
was
able
to
carry
out
this
almost
superhuman
undertaking
his
name
would
be
held
up
to
almost
universal
admiration
beside
those
of
the
greatest
masters
that
we
are
familiar
with
for
no
one
in
greece

italy
has
left
us
any
work
which
surpasses
it
or
which
with
such
simple
means
could
produce
a
similar
impression
of
boldness
and
immensity
it
is
almost
impossible
to
convey
by

those
who
have
not
seen

the
impression
which
it
makes
on
the
spectator

for
themselves

one
hundred

three

row
of

the

dimly
lighted
from
the
roof

stone
gratings
through
which
the
air

the
rays

rendered
more

the
weight
of
its
architrave
the
whole

lies
open
to
the

and
the
sunshine
which
floods
it
pitilessly
reveals
the
mutilations
which
it
has
suffered
in
the
course
of
ages
but
the
general
effect

less
mysterious

none

less
overwhelming
it
is
the
only
monument
in
which

surpasses
the
expectations

immense

with
which

may

left
his
temple

the
sanctuary

its
surrounding
buildings
were
used
for
purposes
of
worship
but
the
court
of
the
customary
pylon
was
wanting
and
merely
a
thin
wall
concealed
the
mysteries
from
the
sight
of
the
vulgar
seti
resolved
to
extend
the
building
in
a
northerly
direction
without
interfering
with
the
thin
screen
which
had
satisfied
his
predecessors
starting
from
the
entrance
in
this
wall
he
planned
an
avenue
of
giant
columns
rivalling
those
of
karnak
which
he
destined
to
become
the
central
colonnade
of
a
hypostyle
hall
as
vast
as
that
of
the
sister
temple
either
money
or
time
was
lacking
to
carry
out
his
intention
he
died
before
the
aisles
on
either
side
were
even
begun
at
abydos
however
he
was
more
successful
we
do
not
know
the
reason
of
particular
affection
for
this
town
it
is
possible
that
his
family
held
some
fief
there
or
it
may
be
that
he
desired
to
show
the
peculiar
estimation
in
which
he
held
its
local
god
and
intended
by
the
homage
that
he
lavished
on
him
to
cause
the
fact
to
be
forgotten
that
he
bore
the
name
of

large
courtyard
bordered

the
temple
façade
which
was
composed
of
a
portico
resting
on
square
pillars
passing
between

reach
two
halls
supported
of
graceful
outline
beyond
which
are
eight
chapels
arranged
in

line
side
by
side
in

of
two
chambers

in
to

for
the
reception

the
holy
of
holies
in
ordinary
temples
is
surrounded
by
chambers
of
lesser
importance
but
here
it
is
concealed
behind
them
the
mainly
employed
here
was
the
white
limestone
of
tûrah
but
of
a
most
beautiful
quality
which
lent
itself
to
the
execution
of
of
great
delicacy
perhaps
the
finest
in
ancient
egypt
the
artists
who
carved
and
painted
them
belonged
to
the
theban
school
and
while
their
subjects
betray
a
remarkable
similarity
to
those
of
the
monuments
dedicated
by
amenôthes
the
execution
surpasses
them
in
freedom
and
perfection
of
modelling
we
can
in
fact
trace
in
them
the
influence
of
the
artists
who
furnished
the
drawings
for
the
scenes
at
tel
they
have
represented
the
gods
and
goddesses
with
the
same
type
of
profile
as
that
of
the
king

type
of
face
of
much
purity
and
gentleness
with
its
aquiline
nose
its
decided
mouth

and
melancholy
smile
when
the
decoration
of
the
temple
was
completed
seti
regarded
the
building
as
too
small
for
its
divine
inmate
and
accordingly
added
to
it
a
new
wing
which
he
built
along
the
whole
length
of
the
southern
wall
but
he
was
unable
to
finish
it
completely
several
parts
of
it
are
lined
with
religious
representations
but
in
others
the
subjects
have
been
merely
sketched
out
in
black
ink
with
corrections
in
red
while
elsewhere
the
walls
are
bare
except
for
a
few
inscriptions
scribbled
over
them
after
an
interval
of
twenty
centuries
by
the
monks
who
turned
the
temple
chambers
into
a
convent
this
new
wing
was
connected
with
the
second
hypostyle
hall
of
the
original
building
by
a
passage
on
one
of
the
walls
of
which
is
a
list
of
royal
names
representing
the
ancestors
of
the
sovereign
traced
back
to

the
whole
temple
must
be
regarded
as
a
vast
funerary
chapel
and
no
one
who
has
studied
the
religion
of
egypt
can
entertain
a
doubt
as
to
its
purpose
abydos
was
the
place
where
the
dead
assembled
before
passing
into
the
other
world
it
was
here
at
the
mouth
of
the
that
they
received
the
provisions
and
offerings
of
their
relatives
and
friends
who
remained
on
this
earth
as
the
dead
flocked
hither
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
they
collected
round
the
tomb
of
osiris
and
there
waited
till
the
moment

to
embark
on
the
boat
of
the
sun
seti
did
not
wish
his
soul
to
associate
with
those
of
the
common
crowd
of
his
vassals
and
prepared
this
temple
for
himself
as
a
separate
close
to
the
mouth
of
hades
after
having
dwelt
within
it
for
a
short
time
subsequent
to
his
funeral
his
soul
could
repair
thither
whenever
it
desired
certain
of
always
finding
within
it
the
incense
and
the
nourishment
of
which
it
stood
in
need
thebes
possessed
this
actual
tomb
the
chapel
was
at
qurnah

little
to
the
north
of
the
group
of
pyramids

which
the
pharaohs
of
the
xith
dynasty
lay
side
by
side
with
those
of
the
xiiith
and
xviith
ramses
had
begun
to
build
it
and
seti
continued
the
work
dedicating
it
to
the
cult
of
his
father
and
of
himself

altogether
disappeared
but
the
façade
with
columns
is
nearly
perfect

with
several
of
the
chambers
in

sanctuary
the
decoration
is
as
carefully
carried
out
and
the
execution
as
delicate
as
that
in
the
work
at
abydos
we
are
tempted
to
believe
from
one
or
two
examples
of
it
that
the
same
hands
have
worked
at
both
buildings

the
temple
of
qurnah

photograph
by

the
tomb
is
some
distance
away
up
in
the
mountain
but
not
in
the
same
ravine
as
that
in
which
amenôthes
aï
and
probably
tûtankhamon
and
harmhabî
are
buried
there
are
in
fact
close
to
those
of
aï
and
amenôthes
three
other
tombs
two
at
least
of
which
have
been
decorated
with
paintings
now
completely
obliterated
and
which
may
have
served
as
the
of
tûtankhamon
and
harmhabî
the
earlier
egyptologists
believed
them
to
have
been
dug
by
the
first
kings
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
there
then
existed
behind
the
rock
amphitheatre
of
deîr
a
kind
of
enclosed
basin
which
could
be
reached
from
the
plain
only
by
dangerous
paths
above
the
temple
of
hâtshopsîtû
this
basin
is
divided
into
two
parts
one
of
which
runs
in
a
direction
while
the
other
trends
to
the
and
is
subdivided
into
minor
branches
to
the
east
rises
a
barren
peak
the
outline
of
which
is
not
unlike
that
of
the
of
saqqâra
reproduced
on
a
colossal
scale
no
spot
could
be
more
appropriate
to
serve
as
a
cemetery
for
a
family
of
kings
the
difficulty
of
reaching
it
and
of
conveying
thither
the
heavy
accessories
and
of
providing
for
the
endless
processions
of
the
pharaonic
funerals
prevented
any
attempt
being
made
to
cut
tombs
in
it
during
the
ancient
and
middle
empires
about
the
beginning
of
the
xixth
dynasty
however
some
engineers
in
search
of
suitable
burial
sites
at
length
noticed
that
this
basin
was
only
separated
from
the
wady
issuing
to
the
north
of
qurnah
by
a
rocky
barrier
barely
five
hundred
cubits
in
width
this
presented
no
formidable
obstacle
to
such
skilful
engineers
as
the
egyptians
they
cut
a
trench
into
the
living
rock
some
fifty
or
sixty
cubits
in
depth
at
the
bottom
of
which
they
tunnelled
a
narrow
passage
giving
access
to
the
valley
french
scholars
recognised
from
the
beginning
of
this
century
that
the
passage
in
question
had
been
made
by
human
agency
i
attribute
the
execution
of
this
work
to
ramses
as
i
believe
harmhabî
to
have
been
buried
in
the
eastern
valley
near
amenôthes
iii
it
is
not
known
whether
this
herculean
work
was
accomplished
during
the
reign
of
harnhabî
or
in
that
of
ramses
i
the
latter
was
the
first
of
the
pharaohs
to
honour
the
spot
by
his
presence
his
tomb
is
simple
almost
coarse
in
its
workmanship
and
comprises
a
gentle
inclined
passage
a
vault
and
a
sarcophagus
of
rough
stone
that
of
seti
on
the
contrary
is
a
veritable
palace
extending
to
a
distance
of
feet
into
the
it
is
entered
by
a
wide
and
lofty
door
which
opens
on
to
a
staircase
of
steps
leading
to
an
inclined
corridor
other
staircases
of
shallow
steps
follow
with
their
landings
then
come
successively
a
hypostyle
hall
and
at
the
extreme
end
a
vaulted
chamber
all
of
which
are
decorated
with
mysterious
scenes
and
covered
with
inscriptions
this
is
however
but
the
first
storey
containing
the
antechambers
of
the
dead
but
not
their
a
passage
and
steps
concealed
under
a
slab
to
the
left
of
the
hall
lead
to
the
real
vault
which
held
the
mummy
and
its
funerary
furniture
as
we
penetrate
further
and
further
by
the
light
of
torches
into
this
subterranean
abode
we
see
that
the
walls
are
covered
with
pictures
and
formulae
setting
forth
the
voyages
of
the
soul
through
the
twelve
hours
of
the
night
its
trials
its
judgment
its
reception
by
the
departed
and
its
apotheosis
all
depicted
on
the
rock
with
the
same
perfection
as
that
which
characterises
the
on
the
finest
slabs
of
tûrah
stone

qurnah
and
abydos
a
gallery

out
of
the
last
of
these
chambers

a
few
feet
further
and
then
stops
abruptly
the
engineers
had
contemplated
the
excavation
of
a
third
storey
to
the
tomb
when
the
death
of
their
master
obliged
them
to
suspend
their
task
the
sarcophagus
consists
of
a
block
of
alabaster
hollowed
out
polished
and
carved
with
figures
and
hieroglyphs

all
the
minuteness
which
we
associate
with

cutting

picked
out
in

that
of
a
thin
elderly
man
well
preserved
the
face
was
covered
by
a
mask
made
of
linen
smeared
with
pitch
but
when
this
was
raised
by
means
of
a
chisel
the
fine
kingly
head
was
exposed
to
view
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
the
art
of
the
embalmer
and
the
expression
of
the
face
was
that
of
one
who
had
only
a
few
hours
previously
breathed
his
last
death
had
slightly
drawn
the
nostrils
and
contracted
the
lips
the
pressure
of
the
bandages
had
flattened
the
nose
a
little
and
the
skin
was
darkened
by
the
pitch
but
a
calm
and
gentle
smile
still
played
over
the
mouth
and
the
eyelids
allowed
a
glimpse
to
be
seen
from
under
their
lashes
of
an
apparently
moist
and
glistening
line
the
reflection
from
the
white
porcelain

the

soon
after

return
and
his
right
to

crown
devolved
on
his
younger

like
his
grandfather
bore
the
name
of

the
prince
was
still
very
young
but
seti
did
not
on
that
account
delay
enthroning
with
great
pomp

a
better
right

the

accession
of

is
known
to
us
from
the
narrative
given
by
himself
in

the
bulk
of

to
counteract
the

ramses
felt
the
importance
of
possessing
a
town
close
to
the
isthmus
where
he
could
reside
in
security
and
he
therefore
built
close
to
zalû
in
a
fertile
and
healthy
locality
a
stronghold
to
which
he
gave
his
own
name
and
of
which
the
poets
of
the
time
have
left
us
an
enthusiastic
description
extends
they
say
zahi

it
resembles
hermonthis

quit

could
keep
watch
against
all
intriguing
adversaries

on

an
allusion
to
the

occurs
in

inscription
at

dated
in

xxvth
year
nothing
appeared
for
the
moment
to
threaten
the
peace
of

empire
the
asiatic
vassals
had
raised
no
disturbance
on
hearing
of
the
accession
and
mautallu
continued
to
observe
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
which
he
had
signed
with

two
military
expeditions
undertaken
beyond
the
isthmus
in

years
of

were
accomplished
almost
without

repressed
by
the
way
the
marauding
shaûsû
and
on
reaching
the
nahr
which
then
formed
the
northern
frontier
of
his
empire
he
inscribed
at
the
turn
of
the
road
on
the
rocks
which
overhang
the
mouth
of
the
river
two
triumphal
stelæ
in
which
he
related
his
successes
towards
the
end
of
his
ivth
year
a
rebellion
broke
out
among
the
khâti
which
caused
a
rupture
of
relations
between
the
two
kingdoms
and
led
to
some
irregular
fighting
khâtusaru
a
younger
brother
of
maurusaru
murdered
the
latter
and
made
himself
king
in
his
stead
it
is
not
certain
whether
the
egyptians
took
up
arms
against
him
or
whether
he
judged
it
wise
to
oppose
them
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
his
subjects
from
his
crime
the
stelæ
are
all
in
a
very
bad
condition
in
the
last
of

is
no

the
name
of

found
later
on
under
the
form
khatusharu
in
that
of
a
chief
defeated
by
in
the
country
of
kummukh
though
this
name
has
generally
been
read
khatukhi

all
events
he
convoked
his
syrian
vassals
and
collected
his
mercenaries
the
whole
of

their
quota
while
bands
of
dardanians
mysians
trojans

together
with

informed
of
the
movement
by
his
generals
and
the
governors
of
places
on
the
frontier
resolved
to
anticipate
the
attack
he
assembled
an
army
almost
as
incongruous
in
its
component
elements
as
that
of
his
adversary

egyptians
of
unmixed
race
divided
into
four
corps
bearing
the
names

karkisha

kashkisha
by
one
of
those
changes
of
into
which
occur
so
frequently
in
before
a
dental
the
two
different
spellings
seem
to
show
that
the
writers
of
the
inscriptions
bearing
on
this
war
had
before
them
a
list
of
the
allies
of
khâtusaru
written
in
cuneiform
characters
if
we
may
identify
the
nation
with
the
kashki
or
kashku
of
the
assyrian
texts
the
ancestors
of
the
people
of
colchis
of
classical
times
the
termination
of
the
egyptian

would
be
the
inflexion

in
the
account

the
shardana
only
are

but
we
learn
from
a
list
in
the
papyrus
that
the
army
of
ramses
ii
included
in
ordinary
circumstances
in
addition
to
the
shardana
a
contingent
of
mashauasha
kahaka

libyan
and
negro
mercenaries
when
preparations
were
completed
the
force
crossed
the
canal
at

on
the
of
payni
in
his
vth
year
marched
rapidly
across
canaan
till
they
reached
the
valley
of
the
litâny
along
which
they
took
their
way
and
then
followed
up
that
of
the
orontes
they
encamped
for
a
few
days
at
shabtuna
to
the
of
qodshû
in
the
midst
of
the
amorite
country
sending
out

discover

possessed

been
placed
on

now

conjecture
approved
by

it
was
more
probably
a

situated
in
the
plain
to
the
south
of

a
little
to

by

and
only
waited
an
opportunity
to
take
the
field
as
an
occasion

not
immediately
present
itself
he
had
recourse
to
a
ruse
with
which
the
generals
of
the
time
were
familiar
ramses
at
length
uneasy
at
not
falling
in
with

advanced
to
the
south

north
of

he
has
rapidly
retired

fear
of
the
this
story
had
every
appearance
of
probability
and
the
distance
khalupu
was
at

forty
leagues
away
explained
why
the
reconnoitring
parties
of
the
egyptians
had
not
fallen
in
with
any
of
the
enemy
the
pharaoh
with
this
information
could
not
decide
whether
to
lay
siege
to
qodshû
and
wait
until
the
hittites
were
forced
to
succour
the
town
or
to
push
on
towards
the
euphrates
and
there
seek
the
engagement

adversary
seemed
anxious
to
avoid

sent
forward
the

which
constituted
the

in
so
doing
many
lives
were
lost
mazraîma
the
prince
of
brother
reached
the
opposite
bank
in
safety
but
the
chief
of
tonisa
was
drowned
and
the
lord
of
khalupu
was
dragged
out
of
the
water
more
dead
than
alive
and
had
to
be
held

downwards
to

the
water
he
had
swallowed

he
could
be
restored

qodshû
issuing
forth
to
help
the
prince
of
khâti
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
by

khâtusaru
himself
was
on
the
point
of
perishing
when
the
troops
which
had
been
shut
up
in
qodshû
together
with
the
inhabitants
made
a
general
sortie
the
egyptians
were
for
a
moment
held
in
check
and
the
fugitives
meanwhile
were
able
to
enter
the
town
either
there
was
insufficient
provision
for
so
many
mouths
or
the
enemy
had
lost
all
heart
from
the
disaster
at
any
rate
further
resistance
appeared
useless
the
next
morning
khâtusaru
sent
to
propose
a
truce
or
peace
to
the
victorious
pharaoh
the
egyptians
had
probably
suffered
at
least
as
much
as
their
adversaries
and
perhaps
regarded
the
eventuality
of
a
siege
with
no
small
distaste
ramses
therefore
accepted
the
offers
made
to
him
and
prepared
to
return
to
egypt
the
fame
of
his
exploits
had
gone
before
him
and
he
himself
was
not
a
little
proud
of
the
energy
he
had
displayed
on
the
day
of
battle
his
predecessors
had
always
shown
themselves
to
be
skilful
generals
and
brave
soldiers
but
none
of
them
had
ever
before
borne
or
all
but
borne
the
brunt
of
an
attack
ramses
loaded
his
manna
with
rewards
for
having
stood
by
him
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
ordered
abundant
provender
and
sumptuous
harness
for
the
good
horses
and
the
who
had
drawn
his
chariot
a
gold
ring
in
the
louvre
bears
in
relief
on
its
bezel
two
little
horses
which
are
probably
and
he
determined
that
the
most
characteristic
episodes
of
the
campaign
the
beating
of
the
spies
the
surprise
of
the
camp
the
repeated
charges
the
arrival
of
his
veterans
the
flight
of
the
syrians
and
the
surrender
of
qodshû
should
be
represented
on
the
walls
and
pylons
of
the
temples
a
poem
in
rhymed
strophes
in
every
case
accompanies
these
records
of
his
glory
whether
at
luxor
at
the
eamesseum
at
the
memnonium
of
abydos
or
in
the
heart
of
nubia
at
abu
simbel
the
author
of
the
poem
must
have
been
present
during
the
campaign
or
must
have
had
the
account
of
it
from
the
lips
of
his
sovereign
for
his
work
bears
no
traces
of
the
coldness
of
official
reports
and
a
warlike
strain
runs
through
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
so
as
still
to
invest
it
with
life
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
thirty
centuries
the
author
is
unknown
pentaûr
or
rather
pentaûîrît
to
whom
de
rougé
attributed
the
poem
is
merely
the
transcriber
of
the
copy
we
possess
on
papyrus
but
little
pains
are
bestowed
on
the
introduction
and
the
poet
does
not
give
free
vent
to
his
enthusiasm
until
the
moment
when
he
describes
his
hero
left
almost
alone
charging
the
enemy
in
the
sight
of
his
followers
the
pharaoh
was
surrounded
by
two
thousand
five
hundred
chariots
and
his
retreat
was
cut
off
by
the
warriors
of
the
khâti
and
of
the
other
nations
who
accompanied
them
the
peoples
of
arvad
mysia
and
pedasos
each
of
their
chariots
contained
three
men
and
the
ranks
were
so
serried
that
they
formed
but
one
dense
mass
other
prince
was
with
me
no
general
officers
no
one
in
command
of
the
archers
or
chariots
my
deserted
me
my
charioteers
fled
before
the
foe
and
not
one
of
them
stood
firm
beside
me
to
fight
against
then
said
his
majesty
art
thou
then
my
father
amon
a
father
who
forgets
his
son
or
have
i
committed
aught
against
thee
have
i
not
marched
and
halted
according
to
thy
command
when
he
does
not
violate
thy
orders
the
lord
of
egypt
is
indeed
great
and
he
overthrows
the
barbarians
in
his
path
what
are
these
asiatics
to
thy
heart
amon
will
humiliate
those
who
know
not
the
god
have
i
not
consecrated
innumerable
offerings
to
thee
filling
thy
holy
with
my
prisoners
i
build
thee
a
temple
for
millions
of
years
i
lavish
all
my
goods
on
thy
storehouses
i
offer
thee
the
whole
world
to
enrich
thy
domains
a
miserable
fate
indeed
awaits
him
who
sets
himself
against
thy
will
but
happy
is
he
who
finds
favour
with
thee
by
deeds
done
for
thee
with
a
loving
heart
i
invoke
thee
o
my
father
amon
here
am
i
in
the
midst
of
people
so
numerous
that
it
can
not
be
known
who
are
the
nations
joined
together
against
me
and
i
am
alone
among
them
none
other
is
with
me
my
many
soldiers
have
forsaken
me
none
of
my
charioteers
looked
towards
me
when
i
called
them
not
one
of
them
heard
my
voice
when
i
cried
to
them
but
i
find
that
amon
is
more
to
me
than
a
million
soldiers
than
a
hundred
thousand
charioteers
than
a
myriad
of
brothers
or
young
sons
joined
all
together
for
the
number
of
men
is
as
nothing
amon
is
greater
than
all
of
them
each
time
i
have
accomplished
these
things
amon
by
the
counsel
of
thy
mouth
as
i
do
not
transgress
thy
orders
i
rendered
thee
glory
even
to
the
ends
of
the
so
calm
an
invocation
in
the
thick
of
the
battle
would
appear
misplaced
in
the
mouth
of
an
ordinary
man
but
pharaoh
was
a
god
and
the
son
of
a
god
and
his
actions
and
speeches
can
not
be
measured
by
the
same
standard
as
that
of
a
common
mortal
he
was
possessed
by
the
religious
spirit
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
while
his
body
continued
to
fight
his
soul
took
wing
to
the
throne
of
amon
he
contemplates
the
lord
of
heaven
face
to
face
reminds
him
of
the
benefits
which
he
had
received
from
him
and
summons
him
to
his
aid
with
an
imperiousness
which
betrays
the
sense
of
his
own
divine
origin
the
expected
help
was
not
delayed
the
voice
resounds
in
hermonthis
amon
arises
at
my
behest
he
stretches
out
his
hand
to
me
and
i
cry
out
with
joy
when
he
hails
me
from
behind
to
face
with
thee
face
to
face
with
thee
ramses
miamun
i
am
with
thee
it
is
i
thy
father
my
hand
is
with
thee
and
i
am
worth
more
to
thee
than
hundreds
of
thousands
i
am
the
strong
one
who
loves
valour
i
have
beheld
in
thee
a
courageous
heart
and
my
heart
is
satisfied
my
will
is
about
to
be
accomplished
i
am
like
montû
from
the
right
i
shoot
with
the
dart
from
the
left
i
seize
the
enemy
i
am
like
baal
in
his
hour
before
them
i
have
encountered
two
thousand
five
hundred
chariots
and
as
soon
as
i
am
in
their
midst
they
are
overthrown
before
my
mares
not
one
of
all
these
people
has
found
a
hand
wherewith
to
fight
their
hearts
sink
within
their
breasts
fear
paralyses
their
limbs
they
know
not
how
to
throw
their
darts
they
have
no
strength
to
hold
their
lances
i
precipitate
them
into
the
water
like
as
the
crocodile
plunges
therein
they
are
prostrate
face
to
the
earth
one
upon
the
other
and
i
slay
in
the
midst
of
them
for
i
have
willed
that
not
one
should
look
behind
him
nor
that
one
should
return
he
who
falls
rises
not
this
sudden
descent
of
the
god
has
even
at
the
present
day
an
effect
upon
the
reader
prepared
though
he
is
by
his
education
to
consider
it
as
a
literary
artifice
but
on
the
egyptian
brought
up
to
regard
amon
with
boundless
reverence
its
influence
was
irresistible
the
prince
of
the
khâti
repulsed
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
certain
of
victory
with
terror
he
sends
against
the
enemy
the
various
chiefs
followed
by
their
chariots
and
skilled
warriors
the
chiefs
of
arvad
lycia
and
ilion
the
leaders
of
the
lycians
and
dardanians
the
lords
of
carchemish
of
the
girgashites
and
of
khalupu
these
allies
of
the
khâti
all
together
comprised
three
thousand
their
efforts
however
were
in
vain
fell
upon
them
like
montû
my
hand
devoured
them
in
the
space
of
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
them
i
hewed
down
and
slew
they
said
one
to
another
is
no
man
who
is
amongst
us
it
is
sûtkhû
the
great
warrior
it
is
baal
incarnate
these
are
not
human
actions
which
he
accomplishes
alone
by
himself
he
repulses
hundreds
of
thousands
without
leaders
or
men
up
let
us
flee
before
him
let
us
seek
to
save
our
lives
and
let
us
breathe
again
when
at
last
towards
evening
the
army
again
rallies
round
the
king
and
finds
the
enemy
completely
defeated
the
men
hang
their
heads
with
mingled
shame
and
admiration
as
the
pharaoh
reproaches
them
will
the
whole
earth
say
when
it
is
known
that
you
left
me
alone
and
without
any
to
succour
me
that
not
a
prince
not
a
charioteer
not
a
captain
of
archers
was
found
to
place
his
hand
in
mine
i
fought
i
repulsed
millions
of
people
by
myself
alone
and
were
my
glorious
horses
it
was
they
that
i
found
under
my
hand
when
i
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
quaking
foe
i
myself
will
cause
them
to
take
their
food
before
me
each
day
when
i
shall
be
in
my
palace
for
i
was
with
them
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
along
with
the
prince
manna
my
and
with
the
officers
of
my
house
who
accompanied
me
and
who
are
my
witnesses
for
the
combat
these
are
those
whom
i
was
with
i
have
returned
after
a
victorious
struggle
and
i
have
smitten
with
my
sword
the
assembled
the
ordeal
was
a
terrible
one
for
the
khâti
but
when
the
first
moment
of
defeat
was
over
they
again
took
courage
and
resumed
the
campaign
this
single
effort
had
not
exhausted
their
resources
and
they
rapidly
filled
up
the
gaps
which
had
been
made
in
their
ranks
the
plains
of
naharaim
and
the
mountains
of
cilicia
supplied
them
with
fresh
chariots
and
in
the
place
of
those
they
had
lost
and
bands
of
mercenaries
were
furnished
from
the
of
asia
minor
so
that
when
ramses
ii
reappeared
in
syria
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
completely
fresh
army
khâtusaru
having
profited
by
experience
did
not
again
attempt
a
general
engagement
but
contented
himself
with
disputing
step
by
step
the
upper
valleys
of
the
litany
and
orontes
meantime
his
emissaries
spread
themselves
over
phoenicia
and
kharû
sowing
the
seeds
of
rebellion
often
only
too
successfully
in
the
viiith
year
there
was
a
general
rising
in
galilee
and
its
towns
galaput
in
the
of
merorn
shalama
dapur
and
had
to
be
reduced
one
after
another
episodes
from
this
war
are
represented
at
karnak
the
list
of
the
towns
taken
now
much
mutilated
comprised
four
names
which
proves
the
importance
of
the
revolt
dapur
was
the
hardest
to
carry
it
crowned
the
top
of
a
rocky
eminence
and
was
protected
by
a
double
wall
which
followed
the
irregularities
of
the
hillside
it
formed
a
for
a
large
force
which
had
to
be
overcome
in
the
open
country
before
the
investment
of
the
town
could
be
attempted
the
siege
was
at
last
brought
to
a
conclusion
after
a
series
of
skirmishes
and
the
town
taken
by
scaling
four
egyptian
princes
having
been
employed
in
conducting
the
attack
in
the
ixth
year
a
revolt
broke
out
on
the
egyptian
frontier
in
the
shephelah
and
the
king
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
troops
to
crush
it
ascalon
in
which
the
peasantry
and
their
families
had
found
as
they
hoped
a
safe
refuge
opened
its
gates
to
the
pharaoh
and
its
fall
brought
about
the
submission
of
several
neighbouring
places
this
it
appears
was
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
the
conquests
in
syria
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
regions
attempted
to
take
up
arms
and
we
may
well
ask
what
could
have
induced
them
thus
to
renounce
their
ancient
loyalty
their
defection
reduced
egypt
for
the
moment
almost
to
her
natural
frontiers
peace
had
scarcely
been
resumed
when
war
again
broke
out
with
fresh
violence
in
and
one
year
it
reached
even
to
naharaim
and
raged
around
tunipa
as
in
the
days
of
thûtmosis
iii
assembled
his
and
chariots
and
he
commanded
his
and
his
chariots
to
attack
the
perverse
khâti
who
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tunipa
and
he
put
on
his
armour
and
mounted
his
chariot
and
he
waged
battle
against
the
town
of
the
perverse
khâti
at
the
head
of
his
and
his
chariots
covered
with
his
armour
the
fortress
however
did
not
yield
till
the
second
attack
ramses
carried
his
arms
still
further
afield
and
with
such
results
that
to
judge
merely
from
the
triumphal
lists
engraved
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
karnak
the
inhabitants
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
those
in
carchemish
mitanni
singar
assyria
and
mannus
found
themselves
once
more
at
the
mercy
of
the
egyptian
battalions
these
victories
however
brilliant
were
not
decisive
if
after
any
one
of
them
the
princes
of
assyria
and
singar
may
have
sent
presents
to
the
pharaoh
the
hittites
on
the
other
hand
did
not
consider
themselves
beaten
and
it
was
only
after
fifteen
campaigns
that
they
were
at
length
sufficiently
subdued
to
propose
a
treaty
at
last
in
the
egyptian
xxist
year
on
the
of
the
month
tybi
when
the
pharaoh
then
residing
in
his
good
town
of
anakhîtû
was
returning
from
the
temple
where
he
had
been
offering
prayers
to
his
father
to
harmakhis
of
heliopolis
to
phtah
and
to
sûtkhû
the
valiant
son
of
nûît
eamses
one
of
the
who
filled
the
office
of
lieutenant
for
the
king
in
asia
arrived
at
the
palace
and
presented
to
him
tartisubu
who
was
authorised
to
make
peace
with
egypt
in
the
name
of
khâtusaru
tartisubu
carried
in
his
hand
a
tablet
of
silver
on
which
his
master
had
prescribed
the
conditions
which
appeared
to
him
just
and
equitable
a
short
preamble
recalling
the
alliances
made
between
the
ancestors
of
both
parties
was
followed
by
a
declaration
of
friendship
and
a
reciprocal
obligation
to
avoid
in
future
all
grounds
of
hostility
the
treaty
of
ramses
ii
with
the
prince
of
the
khâti
was
sculptured
at
karnak
not
only
was
a
perpetual
truce
declared
between
both
peoples
but
they
agreed
to
help
each
other
at
the
first
demand
some
enemy
march
against
the
countries
subject
to
the
great
king
of
egypt
and
should
he
send
to
the
great
prince
of
the
khâti
saying
bring
me
forces
against
them
the
great
prince
of
the
khâti
shall
do
as
he
is
asked
by
the
great
king
of
egypt
and
the
great
prince
of
the
khâti
shall
destroy
his
enemies
and
if
the
great
prince
of
the
khâti
shall
prefer
not
to
come
himself
he
shall
send
his
archers
and
his
chariots
to
the
great
king
of
egypt
to
destroy
his
a
similar
clause
ensured
aid
in
return
from
ramses
to
khâtusaru
brother
while
two
articles
couched
in
identical
terms
made
provision
against
the
possibility
of
any
town
or
tribe
dependent
on
either
of
the
two
sovereigns
withdrawing
its
allegiance
and
placing
it
in
the
hands
of
the
other
party
in
this
case
the
egyptians
as
well
as
the
hittites
engaged
not
to
receive
or
at
least
not
to
accept
such
offers
but
to
refer
them
at
once
to
the
legitimate
lord
the
whole
treaty
was
placed
under
the
guarantee
of
the
gods
both
of
egypt
and
of
the

the

itself
ends
by
a
description
of
the
plaque
of
silver
on
which
it
was
engraved
it
was
in
fact
a
facsimile
in
metal
of
one
of
those
clay
tablets
on
which
the
chaldæans
inscribed
their
contracts
the
preliminary
articles
occupied
the
upper
part
in
closely
written
lines
of
cuneiform
characters
while
in
the
middle
in
a
space
left
free
for
the
purpose
was
the
impress
of
two
seals
that
of
the
prince
of
the
khâti
and
of
his
wife
pûûkhîpa
khâtusaru
was
represented
on
them
as
standing
upright
in
the
arms
of
sûtkhû
while
around
the
two
figures
ran
the
inscription
of
sûtkhû
the
sovereign
of
pûûkhîpa
leaned
on
the
breast
of
a
god
the
patron
of
her
native
town
of
aranna
in
qaauadana
and
the
legend
stated
that
this
was
the
seal
of
the
sun
of
the
town
of
àranna
the
regent
of
the
earth
the
text
of
the
treaty
was
continued
beneath
and
probably
extended
to
the
other
side
of
the
tablet
the
original
draft
had
terminated
after
the
description
of
the
seals
but
to
satisfy
the
pharaoh
certain
additional
articles
were
appended
for
the
protection
of
the
commerce
and
industry
of
the
two
countries
for
the
prevention
of
the
emigration
of
artisans
and
for
ensuring
that
steps
taken
against
them
should
be
more
effectual
and
less
cruel
any
criminal
attempting
to
evade
the
laws
of
his
country
and
taking
refuge
in
that
of
the
other
party
to
the
agreement
was
to
be
expelled
without
delay
and
consigned
to
the
officers
of
his
lord
any
fugitive
not
a
criminal
any
subject
carried
off
or
detained
by
force
any
able
artisan
quitting
either
territory
to
take
up
permanent
residence
in
the
other
was
to
be
conducted
to
the
frontier
but
his
act
of
folly
was
not
to
expose
him
to
judicial
condemnation
who
shall
thus
act
his
fault
shall
not
be
brought
up
against
him
his
house
shall
not
be
touched
nor
his

nor
his
children
he
shall
not
have
his
throat
cut
nor
shall
his
eyes
be
touched
nor
his
mouth
nor
his
feet
no
criminal
accusation
shall
be
made
against
this
treaty
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
those
of
which
the
text
has
come
down
to
us
its
principal
conditions
were
perfect
equality
and
reciprocity
between
the
contracting
sovereigns
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
and
the
extradition
of
criminals
and
refugees
the
original
was
drawn
up
in
chaldæan
script
by
the
scribes
of
khâtusaru
probably
on
the
model
of
former
conventions
between
the
pharaohs
and
the
asiatic
courts
and
to
this
the
egyptian
ministers
had
added
a
few
clauses
relative
to
the
pardon
of
emigrants
delivered
up
by
one
or
other
of
the
contracting
parties
when
therefore
tartisubu
arrived
in
the
city
of
eamses
the
acceptance
of
the
treaty
was
merely
a
matter
of
form
and
peace
was
virtually
concluded
it
did
not
confer
on
the
conqueror
the
advantages
which
we
might
have
expected
from
his
successful
campaigns
it
enjoined
on
the
contrary
the
definite
renunciation
of
those
countries
mitanni
naharaim
alasia
and
amurru
over
which
thûtmosis
iii
and
his
immediate
successors
had
formerly
exercised
an
effective
sovereignty
sixteen
years
of
victories
had
left
matters
in
the
same
state
as
they
were
after
the
expedition
of
harmhabî
and
like
his
predecessor
ramses
was
able
to
retain
merely
those
asiatic
provinces
which
were
within
the
immediate
influence
of
egypt
such
as
the
phoenician
coast
proper
kharû
persea
beyond
jordan
the
oases
of
the
arabian
desert
and
the
peninsula
of
sinai
the
papyrus
mentions
a
place
called
of
in
the
neighbourhood
of
aleppo
in
a
part
of
syria
which
was
not
in
egyptian
territory
the
frontier
in
this
locality
must
have
passed
between
arvad
and
byblos
on
the
coast
and
between
qodshû
and
hazor
from
merom
inland
egyptian
rule
on
the
other
side
of
the
jordan
seems
to
be
proved
by
the
monument
discovered
a
few
years
ago
in
the
haurân
and
known
under
the
name
of
the
of
by
the
bedawîn
of
the
neighbourhood
this
apparently
unsatisfactory
result
after
such
supreme
efforts
was
however
upon
closer
examination
not
so
disappointing
for
more
than
half
a
century
at
least
since
the
hittite
kingdom
had
been
developed
and
established
under
the
impulse
given
to
it
by
sapalulu
everything
had
been
in
its
favour
the
campaign
of
seti
had
opposed
merely
a
passing
obstacle
to
its
expansion
and
had
not
succeeded
in
discouraging
its
ambitions
for
its
rulers
still
nursed
the
hope
of
being
able
one
day
to
conquer
syria
as
far
as
the
isthmus
the
check
received
at
qodshû
the
abortive
attempts
to
foment
rebellion
in
galilee
and
the
shephelah
the
obstinate
persistence
with
which
ramses
and
his
army
returned
year
after
year
to
the
attack
the
presence
of
the
enemy
at
tunipa
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
and
in
the
provinces
then
forming
the
very
centre
of
the
hittite
kingdom
in
short
all
the
incidents
of
this
long
struggle
at
length
convinced
khâtusaru
that
he
was
powerless
to
extend
his
rule
in
this
direction
at
the
expense
of
egypt
moreover
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
events
which
occupied
him
on
the
other
frontiers
of
his
kingdom
where
he
may
have
been
engaged
at
the
same
time
in
a
conflict
with
assyria
or
in
repelling
an
incursion
of
the
tribes
on
the
black
sea
the
treaty
with
pharaoh
if
made
in
good
faith
and
likely
to
be
lasting
would
protect
the
southern
extremities
of
his
kingdom
and
allow
of
his
removing
the
main
body
of
his
forces
to
the
north
and
east
in
case
of
attack
from
either
of
these
quarters
the
security
which
such
an
alliance
would
ensure
made
it
therefore
worth
his
while
to
sue
for
peace
even
if
the
egyptians
should
construe
his
overtures
as
an
acknowledgment
of
exhausted
supplies
or
of
inferiority
of
strength
ramses
doubtless
took
it
as
such
and
openly
displayed
on
the
walls
at
karnak
and
in
the
eamesseum
a
copy
of
the
treaty
so
flattering
to
his
pride
but
the
indomitable
resistance
which
he
had
encountered
had
doubtless
given
rise
to
reflections
resembling
those
of
khâtusaru
and
he
had
come
to
realise
that
it
was
his
own
interest
not
to
lightly
forego
the
good
will
of
the
khâti
egypt
had
neighbours
in
africa

were
troublesome
though
not
dangerous

timihû
the
tihonu
the
mashûasha
the
negroes
of

of
pûanît
might
be
a
continual
source
of
annoyance
and
disturbance
even
though
they
were
incapable
of
disturbing
her
supremacy
the
coast
of
the
delta
it
is
true
was
exposed
to
the
piracy
of
northern
nations
but
up
to
that
time
this
had
been
merely
a
local
trouble
easy
to
meet
if
not
to
obviate
altogether
the
only
real
danger
was
on
the
asiatic
side
arising
from
empires
of
ancient
constitution
like
chaldæa
or
from
hordes
who
arriving
at
irregular
intervals
from
the
north
and
carrying
all
before
them
threatened
after
the
example
of
the
hyksôs
to
enter
the
delta
the
hittite
kingdom
acted
as
a
kind
of
buffer
between
the
nile
valley
and
these
nations
both
civilized
and
barbarous
it
was
a
strongly
armed
force
on
the
route
of
the
invaders
and
would
henceforth
serve
as
a
protecting
barrier
through
which
if
the
enemy
were
able
to
pass
it
would
only
be
with
his
strength
broken
or
weakened
by
a
previous
encounter
the
sovereigns
loyally
observed
the
peace
which
they
had
sworn
to
each
other

xxxivth

which

inspired
the
whole

and
of
the
anxiety

the

had
sent
him
sumptuous

at

not

further
to
make
himself
agreeable
to

had
finally

had
formerly
been
ruined
by

how

repair

god
so
that

king
sesostris
may

accordingly
did
as
he
had
proposed

set
out
with

soldiers
together
with
cattle
and

them
with

reached

we
be

how
we
ought
to
act
with
regard
to
the
king
was
then
in
residence
at
ramses
when
the
news
reached
him
he
officially
expressed
his
great
joy
at
the
event
since
it
was
a
thing
unheard
of
in
the
annals
of
the
country
that
so
powerful
a
prince
should
go
to
such
personal
inconvenience
in
order
to
marry
his
daughter
to
an
ally
the
pharaoh
therefore
despatched
his
nobles
and
an
army
to
receive
them
but
he
was
careful
to
conceal
the
anxiety
which
he
felt
all
the
while
and
according
to
custom
took
counsel
of
his
patron
god
sûtkhû
are
these
people
who
come
with
a
message
at
this
time
to
the
country
of
zahi
the
oracle
however
reassured
him
as
to
their
intentions
and
he
thereupon
hastened
to
prepare
for
their
proper
reception
the
embassy
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
the
city
the
princess
at
its
head

by
the
egyptian
troops

off
for
the
purpose
together
with
the
and
charioteers
of
the
khâti
comprising
the
flower
of
their
army
and
militia
a
solemn
festival
was
held
in
their
honour
in
which
food
and
drink
were
served
without
stint
and
was
concluded
by
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
in
the
presence
of
the
egyptian
lords
and
of
the
princes
of
the
whole
earth
the
fact
of
the
marriage
is
known
to
us
by
the
decree
of
phtah
totûnen
at
abu
simbel
in
the
xxxvth
year
of
the
reign
the
account
of
it
in
the
text
is
taken
from
the
stele
at
abu
simbel

lines
are
so
mutilated
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
paraphrase
them
the
stele
of
the
princess
of
bakhtan
has
preserved
the
romantic
version
of
this
marriage
such
as
was
current
about
the
saite
period
the
king
of
the
khâti
must
have
taken
advantage
of
the
expedition
which
the
pharaoh
made
into
asia
to
send
him
presents
by
an
embassy
at
the
head
of
which
he
placed
his
eldest
daughter
the
princess

favour
with
ramses
who
married
her
ramses
unwilling
to
relegate
a
princess
of
such
noble
birth
to
the
companionship
of
his
ordinary
concubines
granted
her
the
title
of
queen
as
if
she
were
of
solar
blood
and
with
the
cartouche
gave
her
the
new
name
of
ûirimaûnofîrurî

the
place
usually
occupied
by
women
of
egyptian
race
only
and
these
unusual
honours
may
have
compensated
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
princess
for
the
disproportion
in
age
between
herself
and
a
veteran
more
than
sixty
years
old
the
friendly
relations
between
the
two
courts

so
intimate
that

pharaoh
invited

to
south
without
incurring
any
risks
beyond
those
occasioned
by
an
untrustworthy
guide
or
a
few
highwaymen

became
in
time
a
common
task
in
the
schools
of
thebes
to
describe
the
typical
syrian
tour
of
some
soldier
or
functionary
and
we
still
possess
one
of
these
imaginative
stories

them
at
the

the

in

put

now
owing
to
the
establishment

the

was
able
to
devote
himself
entirely
to

he
deepened
the

he
repaired
the
walls

the
fortified
places
which
protected
the
frontier
on
the
side
of

sinaitic
peninsula
and
he
built

enlarged
the
strongholds
along
the
nile
at
those
points
most
frequently
threatened
by
the
incursions
of
nomad
tribes
ramses
was
the
royal
builder
and
we
may
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
from
the
second
cataract
to
the
mouths
of
the
nile
there
is
scarcely
an
edifice
on
whose
ruins
we
do
not
find
his
name
in
nubia
where
the
desert
approaches
close
to
the
nile
he
confined
himself
to
cutting
in
the
solid
rock
the
monuments
which
for
want
of
space
he
could
not
build
in
the
open
the
idea
of
the
must
have
occurred
very
early
to

egyptians

were
accustomed
to
house
their
dead

why
then
should
they
not
house
their

further
back

the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
all
the
forms
of
architectural
plan
observed
in
isolated
temples
were
utilised
by
ramses
and
applied
to
buildings
with
more
or
less
modification
according
to
the
nature
of
the
stratum
in
which
he
had
to
work

that
the
completed

became
only

was
in

hear
on

sides

degeneracy

of
its
having
fallen
into
irreparable
neglect
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
truth
than
this
sweeping
statement
there
are
doubtless
many
statues
and
of
this
epoch
which
shock
us
by
their
crudity
and
ugliness

these
owed
their
origin
for
the
most
part
to
provincial
workshops
which
had
been
at
all
times
of
mediocre
repute
and
where
the
artists
did
not
receive
orders
enough
to
enable
them
to
correct
by
practice
the
defects
of
their
education
we
find
but
few
productions
of
the
theban
school
exhibiting
bad
technique

if
we
had
only
this
one
monument
of

which
to
form
our
opinion
of
its
merits
it
would
be
sufficient

prove

the
sculptors

not
a
whit
behind
those
of
harmham

seti
adroitness
in
cutting
the
granite

sandstone
had
in
no

been
lost

the
same
may
be
said
of
the
skill
in
bringing
out
the
contour
and
action
of
the
figure
and
of
the
art
of
infusing
into
the
features

of

of
the
superhuman
majesty
with
which

anywhere
else

the
northern
half
does
not
join
on
to

seems
to
belong
to
quite
a
distinct
structure
or
the
two
parts
might
be
regarded
as
having
once
formed
a
single
edifice
which
had
become
divided
by
an
accident
which
the
architect
had
endeavoured
to
unite
together
again
by
a
line
of
columns
running
between
two
walls
the
masonry
of
the
hypostyle
hall
at
karnak
was
squared
and
dressed
but
the
walls
had
been
left
undecorated

was
also
the
case
with
the
majority
of
the
shafts
of
the
columns

the
surface
of
the
architraves

the
whole
with
a

of
sculptured

painted

ornamental
effect

he

temple
of
amon
then
assumed
the
aspect
which
it
preserved
henceforward
for
centuries
the
ramessides
and
their
successors
occupied
themselves
in
filling
it
with
furniture
and
in
taking
steps
for
the
repair
of
any
damage
that
might
accrue
to
the
hall

they
had
their
cartouches

placed
in
vacant
spaces

they
did
not
dare
to
modify

was
reserved
for
the
ethiopian

pharaohs

still
stand

these
colossal

stimulate
his
spirit

emulation
to
do
something

more
marvellous

erected
here
at

colossal

it

of

in

opinion
the
glory

with

a

is
still
tall
and
of
perfect
proportions
even
after
the
coalescence
of

the
shrinkage
produced
by
mummification
the
body
of
ramses
ii
still
measures
over
feet
inches
the

which
is
bald
on
the

is
somewhat
long
and
small
in

to
the
bulk
of
the

there
is
but
little
hair
on
the

but
at
the

it

preserving
its

up

somewhat
in

after

shows
an
ochreous
yellow
colour
under
the
black
bituminous

the
mask
of
the

gives
a
fair
idea
of
that
of
the
living
king
the
somewhat
unintelligent
expression
slightly
brutish
perhaps
but
haughty
and
firm
of
purpose
displays
itself
with
an
air
of
royal
majesty
beneath
the
sombre
materials
used
by
the
embalmer
the
disappearance
of
the
old
hero
did
not
produce
many
changes
in
the
position
of
affairs
in
egypt
mînephtah
from
this
time
forth
possessed
as
pharaoh
the
power
which
he
had
previously
wielded
as
regent
he
was
now
no
longer
young
born
somewhere
about
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
ramses
he
was
now
sixty
possibly
seventy
years
old
thus
an
old
man
succeeded
another
old
man
at
a
moment
when
egypt
must
have
needed
more
than
ever
an
active
and
vigorous
ruler
the
danger
to
the
country
did
not
on
this
occasion
rise
from
the
side
of
asia
for
the
relations
of
the
pharaoh
with
his
kharu
subjects
continued
friendly
and
during
a
famine
which
desolated
syria
he
sent
wheat
to
his
hittite
allies
a
document
preserved
in
the
papyrus
shows
how
regular
the
relations
with
syria
had
become
it
is
the
journal
of
a
officer
or
of
a
scribe
placed
at
one
of
the
frontier
posts
who
notes
from
day
to
day
the
letters
messengers
officers
and
troops
which
passed
from
the
to
the
of
pachons
in
the
iiird
year
of
the
reign
the
nations
however
to
the
north
and
east
in
libya
and
in
the
mediterranean
islands
had
for
some
time
past
been
in
a
restless
condition
which
boded
little
good
to
the
empires
of
the
old
world
the
tirnihû
some
of
them
tributaries
from
the
xiith
and
others
from
the
first
years
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
had
always
been
troublesome
but
never
really
dangerous
neighbours
from
time
to
time
it
was
necessary
to
send
light
troops
against
them
who
sailing
along
the
coast
or
following
the
caravan
routes
would
enter
their
territory
force
them
from
their
retreats
destroy
their
palm
groves
carry
off
their
cattle
and
place
garrisons
in
the
principal
oases
even
in
sîwah
itself
for
more
than
a
century
however
it
would
seem
that
more
active
and
numerically
stronger
populations
had
entered
upon
the
stage
a
current
of
invasion
having
its
origin
in
the
region
of
the
atlas
or
possibly
even
in
europe
was
setting
towards
the
nile
forcing
before
it
the
scattered
tribes
of
the
sudan
who
were
these
invaders
were
they
connected
with
the
race
which
had
planted
its
dolmens
over
the
plains
of
the
maghreb
whatever
the
answer
to
this
question
may
be
we
know
that
a
certain
number
of
berber
the
labû
and
mashaûasha
who
had
occupied
a
middle
position
between
egypt
and
the
people
behind
them
and
who
had
only
irregular
communications
with
the
nile
valley
were
now
pushed
to
the
front
and
forced
to
descend
upon
it
the
nationality
of
these
tribes
is
evidenced
by
the
names
of
their
chiefs
which
recall
exactly
those
of
the
numidians
massyla
massinissa
massiva
the
labû
laûbû
lobû
are
mentioned
for
the
first
time
under
ramses
ii
these
are
the
libyans
of
classical
geographers
the
mashaûasha
answer
to
the
maxycs
of
herodotus
they
furnished
mercenaries
to
the
armies
of
ramses
ii
they
were
men
tall
of
stature
and
large
of
limb
with
fair
skins
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
everything
in
fact
indicating
their
northern
origin
they
took
pleasure
in
tattooing
the
skin
just
as
the
tuaregs
and
kabyles
are
now
accustomed
to
do
and
some
if
not
all
of
them
practised
circumcision
like
a
portion
of
the
egyptians
and
semites
in
the
arrangement
of
the
hair
a
curl
fell
upon
the
shoulder
while
the
remainder
was
arranged
in
small
frizzled
locks
their
chiefs
and
braves
wore
on
their
heads
two
flowering
plumes
a
a
skin
thrown
over
the
back
a
mantle
or
rather
a
covering
of
woollen
or
dyed
cloth
fringed
and
ornamented
with
needlework
falling
from
the
left
shoulder
with
no
attachment
in
front
so
as
to
leave
the
body
unimpeded
in
walking
these
constituted
the
ordinary
costume
of
the
people
their
arms
were
similar
to
those
of
the
egyptians
consisting
of
the
lance
the
mace
the
iron
or
copper
dagger
the
boomerang
the
bow
and
arrow
and
the
sling
illustration
a
libyan
drawn
by
from
a
photograph
they
also
employed
horses
and
chariots
their
bravery
made
them
a
foe
not
to
be
despised
in
spite
of
their
ignorance
of
tactics
and
their
want
of
discipline
when
they
were
afterwards
formed
into
regiments
and
conducted
by
experienced
generals
they
became
the
best
auxiliary
troops
which
egypt
could
boast
of
the
labû
from
this
time
forward
were
the
most
energetic
of
the
tribes
and
their
chiefs
prided
themselves
upon
possessing
the
leadership
over
all
the
other
clans
in
this
region
of
the
world
this
was
the
case
in
the
wars
of
mînephtah
and
ramses
in
which
the
labû
and
their
kings
took
the
command
of
the
confederate
armies
assembled
against
egypt
the
labû
might
very
well
have
gained
the
mastery
over
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
desert
at
this
period
who
had
become
enfeebled
by
the
frequent
defeats
which
they
had
sustained
at
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
at
the
moment
when
mînephtah
ascended
the
throne
their
king
mâraîû
son
of
didi
ruled
over
the
immense
territory
lying
between
the
fayûm
and
the
two
syrtes
the
timihu
the
kahaka
and
the
mashaûasha
rendered
him
the
same
obedience
as
his
own
people
a
revolution
had
thus
occurred
in
africa
similar
to
that
which
had
taken
place
a
century
previously
in
naharaim
when
sapalulu
founded
the
hittite
empire
a
great
kingdom
rose
into
being
where
no
state
capable
of
disturbing
egyptian
control
had
existed
before
the
danger
was
serious
the
hittites
separated
from
the
nile
by
the
whole
breadth
of
kharu
could
not
directly
threaten
any
of
the
egyptian
cities
but
the
libyans
lords
of
the
desert
were
in
contact
with
the
delta
and
could
in
a
few
days
fall
upon
any
point
in
the
valley
they
chose
mînephtah
therefore
hastened
to
resist
the
assault
of
the
westerns
as
his
father
had
formerly
done
that
of
the
easterns
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
found
among
the
troops
of
his
new
enemies
some
of
the
adversaries
with
whom
the
egyptians
had
fought
under
the
walls
of
qodshû
sixty
years
before
the
shardana
lycians
and
others
having
left
the
coasts
of
the
delta
and
the
phoenician
seaports
owing
to
the
vigilant
watch
kept
by
the
egyptians
over
their
waters
had
betaken
themselves
to
the
libyan
littoral
where
they
met
with
a
favourable
reception
whether
they
had
settled
in
some
places
and
formed
there
those
colonies
of
which
a
greek
tradition
of
a
recent
age
speaks
we
can
not
say
they
certainly
followed
the
occupation
of
mercenary
soldiers
and
many
of
them
hired
out
their
services
to
the
native
princes
while
others
were
enrolled
among
the
troops
of
the
king
of
the
khâti
or
of
the
pharaoh
himself
mâraîû
brought
with
him
achæans
shardana
tûrsha
shagalasha
and
lycians
in
considerable
numbers
when
he
resolved
to
begin
the
strife
this
was
not
one
of
those
conventional
little
wars
which
aimed
at
nothing
further
than
the
imposition
of
the
payment
of
a
tribute
upon
the
conquered
or
the
conquest
of
one
of
their
provinces
mâraîû
had
nothing
less
in
view
than
the
transport
of
his
whole
people
into
the
nile
valley
to
settle
permanently
there
as
the
hyksôs
had
done
before
him
the
shakalasha
shagalasha
identified
with
the
sicilians
by
de
rougé
were
a
people
of
asia
minor
whose
position
there
is
approximately
indicated
by
the
site
of
the
town
sagalassos
named
after
them

set
out
on
his
march
towards
the
end
of
the
ivth
year
of
the
reign
or
the
beginning
of
his
vth

by
the
elite
of
his
troops
first
choice
from
among
all
the
soldiers
and
all
the
heroes
in
each
the
announcement
of
their
approach
spread
terror
among
the
egyptians
the
peace
which
they
had
enjoyed
for
fifty
years
had
cooled
their
warlike
ardour
and
the
machinery
of
their
military
organisation
had
become
somewhat
rusty
the
standing
army
had
almost
melted
away
the
regiments
of
archers
and
charioteers
were
no
longer
effective
and
the
neglected
fortresses
were
not
strong
enough
to
protect
the
frontier
as
a
consequence
the
oases
of
farafrah
and
of
the
natron
lakes
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
at
the
first
attack
and
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
delta
became
the
possession
of
the
invader
before
any
steps
could
be
taken
for
their
defence
memphis
which
realised
the
imminent
danger
broke
out
into
open
murmurs
against
the
negligent
rulers
who
had
given
no
heed
to
the
ramparts
and
had
allowed
the
garrisons
of
its
fortresses
to
dwindle
away
fortunately
syria
remained
quiet
the
khâti
in
return
for
the
aid
afforded
them
by
mînephtah
during
the
famine
observed
a
friendly
attitude
and
the
pharaoh
was
thus
enabled
to
withdraw
the
troops
from
his
asiatic
provinces
he
could
with
perfect
security
take
the
necessary
measures
for
ensuring
the
city
of
tûmû
against
surprise
arming
memphis
the
citadel
of
and
for
restoring
all
things
which
were
in
disorder
he
fortified
pibalîsît
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shakana
canal
on
a
branch
of
that
of
heliopolis
and
he
rapidly
concentrated
his
forces
behind
these
quickly
organised
lines
chabas
would
identify
pibalîsît
with
bubastis
i
agree
with
brugsch
in
placing
it
at
belbeîs
mâraîû
however
continued
to
advance
in
the
early
months
of
the
summer
he
had
crossed
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
and
was
now
about
to
encamp
not
far
from
the
town
of
pirici
when
the
king
heard
of
this
became
furious
against
them
as
a
lion
that
fascinates
its
victim
he
called
his
officers
together
and
addressed
them
am
about
to
make
you
hear
the
words
of
your
master
and
to
teach
you
this
i
am
the
sovereign
shepherd
who
feeds
you
i
pass
my
days
in
seeking
out
that
which
is
useful
for
you
i
am
your
father
is
there
among
you
a
father
like
me
who
makes
his
children
live
you
are
trembling
like
geese
you
do
not
know
what
is
good
to
do
no
one
gives
an
answer
to
the
enemy
and
our
desolated
land
is
abandoned
to
the
incursions
of
all
nations
the
barbarians
harass
the
frontier
rebels
violate
it
every
day
every
one
robs
it
enemies
devastate
our
seaports
they
penetrate
into
the
fields
of
egypt
if
there
is
an
arm
of
a
river
they
halt
there
they
stay
for
days
for
months
they
come
as
numerous
as
reptiles
and
no
one
is
able
to
sweep
them
back
these
wretches
who
love
death
and
hate
life
whose
hearts
meditate
the
consummation
of
our
ruin
behold
they
arrive
with
their
chief
they
pass
their
time
on
the
land
which
they
attack
in
filling
their
stomachs
every
day
this
is
the
reason
why
they
come
to
the
land
of
egypt
to
seek
their
sustenance
and
their
intention
is
to
install
themselves
there
mine
is
to
catch
them
like
fish
upon
their
bellies
their
chief
is
a
dog
a
poor
devil
a
madman
he
shall
never
sit
down
again
in
his
he
then
announced
that
on
the
of
epiphi
he
would
himself
conduct
the
troops
against
the
enemy
these
were
brave
words
but
we
may
fancy
the
figure
that
this
king
of
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
would
have
presented
in
a
chariot
in
the
middle
of
the
fray
and
his
competence
to
lead
an
effective
charge
against
the
enemy
on
the
other
hand
his
absence
in
such
a
critical
position
of
affairs
would
have
endangered
the
of
his
soldiers
and
possibly
compromised
the
issue
of
the
battle
a
dream
settled
the
whole
question
ed
meyer
sees
in
this
nothing
but
a
customary
rhetorical
expression
and
thinks
that
the
god
spoke
in
order
to
encourage
the
king
to
defend
himself
vigorously
while
mînephtah
was
asleep
one
night
he
saw
a
gigantic
figure
of
phtah
standing
before
him
and
forbidding
him
to
advance
cried
the
god
to
him
while
handing
him
the
curved
khopesh
away
discouragement
from
thee
his
majesty
said
to
him
what
am
i

mînephtah
ought
to

he
had
no

intention

his

gave
mâraîû

perhaps
the

to

to
fortify
a
few
new
positions
to
the
east
of

the
libyan
kingdom
was
now
in
the
same
position
as
that
in
which
the
hittite
had
been
after
the
campaign
of
seti
its
power
had
been
checked
for
the
moment
but
it
remained
intact
on
the
egyptian
frontier
awaiting
its
opportunity
mînephtah
lived
for
some
time
after
this
memorable
and
the
number
of
monuments
which
belong
to
this
period
show
that
he
reigned
in
peace
we
can
see
that
he
carried
out
works
in
the
same
places
as
his
father
before
him
at
tanis
as
well
as
thebes
in
nubia
as
well
as
in
the

he
worked
the
sandstone
quarries
for
his
building
materials
and
continued
the
custom
of
celebrating
the
feasts
of
the
inundation

the
stelae
which
he
set
up
on
the
occasion

of
its

of
its
picturesque
appearance
the
last
known
year

his
reign

the

viii
the
lists
of
manetho
assign
to
him
a
reign
of
from
twenty
to
forty
years
brugsch
makes
it
out
to
have
been
years
from
to
which
is
evidently
too
much
but
we
may
attribute
to
him
without
risk
of
serious
error
a
reign
of
about
twenty
years
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
troubled
by
the
intrigues
of
princes
who
aspired
to
the
throne
and
by
the
ambition
of
the
ministers
to
whom
he
was
obliged
to
delegate
his
authority

his
seti

had
doubtless
reached
middle

at
the

his

represent
him
nevertheless
with
the

expression
in

gentle

haughty

somewhat
melancholic

it
were

of

to
him

the
existence
of
disturbances
similar

which
had

up

followed
his

i
have
come
back
to
the
position
of
chabas
making
seti

the
immediate
successor
of
mînephtah

is
also
the
view
of
brugsch

the
succession

given
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be

adopted
has
only
the
merit
of
being
preferable
to
that

previously
supported

the

chabas
was
nevertheless
of
the
opinion
that
he
reigned
a
considerable
time

we
do
not
know
whether
he
left
any
legitimate

two
sovereigns
succeeded
him
who
were
not
directly
connected
with
him
but
were
probably
the
grandsons
of
the
amenmesis
and
the
siphtah
whom
we
meet
with
among
the
children
of
ramses
the
first
of
these
was
also
called
amenmesis

he
held
sway
for
several
years
over
the
whole
of
egypt

over
its
foreign
possessions

this
sovereign

expressions
have
induced

to
believe
that
he
as
well
as
siphtah
came
originally
from
khibît
in
the
aphroditopolite
nome
this
was
an
allusion
as
chabas
had
seen
to
the
myth
of
horus
similar
to
that
relating
to
thûtmosis
and
which
we
more
usually
meet

he
made
an
expedition

received
in

he
kept
up
so
zealously
the
appearance
of
universal
dominion
that
to
judge
from

he
must
have
been
the
equal
of
the
most
powerful
of

nevertheless
was
proceeding
at
a
quick
pace
towards
its
downfall
no
sooner
had
this

disappeared
than
it
began
to
break
up
there
were
no

many
claimants
for
the
crown
but
none
of
them
succeeded
in
disposing
of
the
claims
of
his
rivals
and
anarchy
reigned
supreme
from
one
end
of
the
nile

the
other
the
land
of
qîmît
began
to
drift
away
and
the
people
within

no

this
too
for
many
years
until

that

succeeded
in
maintaining

the
little
that
we

about
this
period

been

during
years
of
nothingness
in
which
arisu
a

was

among

the
whole
country
paid
tribute
before
him
every
one
plotted
with
his
neighbour
to
steal
the
goods
of
others

it
was
the
same
with
regard
to
the

as
with

to

no

made

the
name

deciphered
by
chabas

after
him
krall
were
inclined
to
read
it
as
ket
ketesh
in
order
to
identify
it
with
the
ketes
of
diodorus
siculus
a
form
of
the
name
arisai
in
the
bible
may
be
its
original
or
that
of
arish
which
is
found
in
phoenician
especially
punic
inscriptions
this
was
in
truth
the
revenge
of
the
feudal
system
upon
pharaoh
the
barons
kept
in
check
by
ahmosis
and
amenôthes
restricted
by
the
successors
of
these
sovereigns
to
the
position
of
simple
officers

the
king

by
the
general
laxity
to
recover
as
many
as
possible
of
their
ancient
privileges
for
half
a
century

more
fortune
had
given
them
as
masters
only
aged
princes

capable
of
maintaining
continuous
vigilance
and
firmness
the
invasions
of
the
peoples
of
the
sea
the
rivalry
of
the
claimants
to
the
throne
and
the
intrigues
of
ministers
had
one
after
the
other
served
to
break
the
bonds
which
fettered
them
and
in
one
generation
they
were
able
to
regain
that
liberty
of
action
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
for
centuries
to
this
state
of
things
egypt
had
been
drifting
from
the
earliest
times
unity
could
be
maintained
only
by
a
continuous
effort
and
once
this
became
relaxed
the
ties
which
bound
the
whole
country
together
were
soon
broken
there
was
another
danger
threatening
the
country
beside
that
arising
from
the
weakening
of
the
hands
of
the
sovereign
and
the
turbulence
of
the
barons
for
some
three
centuries
the
theban
pharaohs
were
accustomed
to
bring
into
the
country
after
each
victorious
campaign
many
thousands
of
captives
the
number
of
foreigners
around
them
had
therefore
increased
in
a
striking
manner
the
majority
of
these
strangers
either
died
without
issue
or
their
posterity
became
assimilated
to
the
indigenous
inhabitants
in
many
places
however
they
had
accumulated
in
such
proportions
that
they
were
able
to
retain
among
themselves
the
remembrance
of
their
origin
their
religion
and
their
customs
and
with
these
the
natural
desire
to
leave
the
country
of
their
exile
for
their
former
fatherland
as
long
as
a
strict
watch
was
kept
over
them
they
remained
peaceful
subjects
but
as
soon
as
this
vigilance
was
relaxed
rebellion
was
likely
to
break
out
especially
amongst
those
who
worked
in
the
quarries
traditions
of
the
greek
period
contain
certain
romantic
episodes
in
the
history
of
these

obstinacy

it

up

they

afterwards
called
babylon

back

regret

the
time
of

the
name
babylon
comes
probably
from
barbonu
a
term
which
under
the
form
served
to
designate
a
quarter
of
heliopolis

rather
a
suburban

already
attained
forty
years
of

he
one
day
encountered

egyptian
smiting
a

slew

his
anger

burning

him
to
deliver
his
people
the
old
pharaoh
was
dead
but
moses
and
his
brother
aaron
betook
themselves
to
the
court
of
the
new
pharaoh
and
demanded
from
him
permission
for
the
hebrews
to
sacrifice
in
the
desert
of
arabia
they
obtained
it
as
we
know
only
after
the
infliction
of
the
ten
plagues
and
after
the
firstborn
of
the
egyptians
had
been
stricken
the
emigrants
started
from
ramses
as
they
were
pursued
by
a
body
of
troops
the
sea
parted
its
waters
to
give
them
passage
over
the
dry
ground
and
closing
up
afterwards
on
the
egyptian
hosts
overwhelmed
them
to
a
man
thereupon
moses

the
children
of

sang
this
song
unto

have
limited
myself
here
to
a
summary
of
the
biblical
narrative
without
entering
into
a
criticism
of
the
text
which
i
leave
to
others
xv
from
this
narrative
we
see
that
the
hebrews
or
at
least
those
of
them
who
dwelt
in
the
delta
made
their
escape
from
their
oppressors
and
took
refuge
in
the
solitudes
of
arabia
according
to
the
opinion
of
accredited
historians
this
exodus
took
place
in
the
reign
of
mînephtah
and
the
evidence
of
the
triumphal
inscription
lately
discovered
by
petrie
seems
to
confirm
this
view
in
relating
that
the
people
of
israîlû
were
destroyed
and
had
no
longer
a
seed
the
context
indicates
pretty
clearly
that
these
israîlû
were
then
somewhere
south
of
syria
possibly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ascalon
and
glezer
if
it
is
the
biblical
israelites
who
are
here
mentioned
for
the
first
time
on
an
egyptian
monument
one
might
suppose
that
they
had
just
quitted
the
land
of
slavery
to
begin
their
wanderings
through
the
desert
although
the
peoples
of
the
sea
and
the
libyans
did
not
succeed
in
reaching
their
settlements
in
the
land
of
goshen
the
israelites
must
have
profited
both
by
the
disorder
into
which
the
egyptians
were
thrown
by
the
invaders
and
by
the
consequent
withdrawal
to
memphis
of
the
troops
previously
stationed
on
the
east
of
the
delta
to
break
away
from
their
servitude
and
cross
the
frontier
if
on
the
other
hand
the
israîlû
of
mînephtah
are
regarded
as
a
tribe
still
dwelling
among
the
mountains
of
canaan
while
the
greater
part
of
the
race
had
emigrated
to
the
banks
of
the
nile
there
is
no
need
to
seek
long
after
mînephtah
for
a
date
suiting
the
circumstances
of
the
exodus
the
years
following
the
reign
of
seti
ii
offer
favourable
conditions
for
such
a
dangerous
enterprise
the
of
the
monarchy
the
discords
of
the
barons
the
revolts
among
the
captives
and
the
supremacy
of
a
semite
over
the
other
chiefs
must
have
minimised
the
risk
we
can
readily
understand
how
in
the
midst
of
national
disorders
a
tribe
of
foreigners
weary
of
its
lot
might
escape
from
its
settlements
and
betake
itself
towards
asia
without
meeting
with
strenous
opposition
from
the
pharaoh
who
would
naturally
be
too
much
preoccupied
with
his
own
pressing
necessities
to
trouble
himself
much
over
the
escape
of
a
band
of
serfs
having
crossed
the
red
sea
the
israelites
pursued
their
course
to
the
on
the
usual
road
leading
into
syria
and
then
turning
towards
the
south
at
length
arrived
at
sinai
it
was
a
moment
when
the
nations
of
asia
were
stirring
to
proceed
straight
to
canaan
by
the
beaten
track
would
have
been
to
run
the
risk
of
encountering
their
moving
hordes
or
of
jostling
against
the
egyptian
troops
who
still
garrisoned
the
strongholds
of
the
the
fugitives
had
therefore
to
shun
the
great
military
roads
if
they
were
to
avoid
coming
into
murderous
conflict
with
the
barbarians
or
running
into
the
teeth
of
pursuing
army
the
desert
offered
an
appropriate
asylum
to
people
of
nomadic
inclinations
like
themselves
they
betook
themselves
to
it
as
if
by
instinct
and
spent
there
a
wandering
life
for
several
generations
this
explanation
of
the
wanderings
of
the
israelites
has
been
doubted
by
most
historians
it
has
a
cogency
once
we
admit
the
reality
of
the
sojourn
in
egypt
and
the
exodus
the
traditions
collected
in
their
sacred
books
described
at
length
their
marches
and
their
the
great
sufferings
they
endured
and
the
striking
miracles
which
god
performed
on
their
behalf
the
itinerary
of
the
hebrew
people
through
the
desert
contains
a
very
small
number
of
names
which
were
not
actually
in
use
they
represent
possibly
either
the
stations
at
which
the
caravans
of
the
merchants
put
up
or
the
localities
where
the
bedawin
and
their
herds
were
accustomed
to
sojourn
the
majority
of
them
can
not
be
identified
but
enough
can
still
be
made
out
to
give
us
a
general
idea
of
the
march
of
the
emigrants
moses
conducted
them
through
all
these
experiences
continually
troubled
by
their
murmurings
and
seditions
but
always
ready
to
help
them
out
of
the
difficulties
into
which
they
were
led
on
every
occasion
by
their
want
of
faith

taught
them
under

how
to
correct
the
bitterness
of

waters

applying
to
them
the
wood
of
a
certain
tree

they
began
to
look
back
with
regret
to
the
of
and
the
abundance
of
food

another
signal
miracle
was
performed
for
them

the

came
up
and
covered
the
camp

in
the
morning
the
dew
lay
round
about
the
host
and
when
the
dew
that
lay
was
gone
up

upon
the
face
of
the
wilderness
there
lay
a
small
round
thing
as
small
as
the
hoar
frost
on
the
ground

when
the
children
of
israel
saw
it
they
said
one
to
another

fitly
be
used
in
a
general
history
the
people
waited
from
week
to
week
until
jahveh
had
completed
the
revelation
of
his
commands
and
in
their
impatience
broke
the
new
law
more
than
once
on
one
occasion
when
delayed
to
come
out
of
the
mount
they
believed
themselves
abandoned
by
heaven
and
obliged
aaron
the
high
priest
to
make
for
them
a
golden
calf
before
which
they
offered
burnt
offerings
the
sojourn
of
the
people
at
the
foot
of
sinai
lasted
eleven
months
at
the
end
of
this
period
they
set
out
once
more
on
their
slow
marches
to
the
promised
land
guided
during
the
day
by
a
cloud
and
during
the
night
by
a
pillar
of
fire
which
moved
before
them
this
is
a
general
summary
of
what
we
find
in
the
sacred
writings
the
israelites
when
they
set
out
from
egypt
were
not
yet
a
nation
they
were
but
a
confused
horde
flying
with
their
herds
from
their
pursuers
with
no
resources
badly
armed
and
unfit
to
sustain
the
attack
of
regular
troops
after
leaving
sinai
they
wandered
for
some
time
among
the
solitudes
of
arabia
petraea
in
search
of
some
uninhabited
country
where
they
could
fix
their
tents
and
at
length
settled
on
the
borders
of
idumaea
in
the
mountainous
region
surrounding
kadesh
had
from
ancient
times
a
reputation
for
sanctity
among
the
bedawin
of
the
neighbourhood
it
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
wonderful
well
the
well
of
judgment
to
which
visits
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
worship
and
for
obtaining
the
of
god
the
country
is
a
poor
one
arid
and
burnt
up
but
it
contains
wells
which
never
fail
and
wadys
suitable
for
the
culture
of
wheat
and
for
the
rearing
of
cattle
the
tribe
which
became
possessed
of
a
region
in
which
there
was
a
perennial
supply
of
water
was
fortunate
indeed
and
a
fragment
of
the
psalmody
of
israel
at
the
time
of
their
sojourn
here
still
echoes
in
a
measure
the
transports
of
joy
which
the
people
gave
way
to
at
the
discovery
of
a
new
spring
up
o
well
sing
ye
unto
it
the
well
which
the
princes
digged
which
the
nobles
of
the
people
delved
with
the
sceptre
and
with
their
the
site
of
appears
to
have
been
fixed
with
certainty
at
by
trumbull
xxi
the
context
makes
it
certain
that
this
song
was
sung
at
beer
beyond
the
arnon
in
the
land
of
moab
it
has
long
been
recognised
that
it
had
a
special
reference
and
that
it
refers
to
an
incident
in
the
wanderings
of
the
people
through
the
desert
the
wanderers
took
possession
of
this
region
after
some
successful
brushes
with
the
enemy
and
settled
there
without
being
further
troubled
by
their
neighbours
or
by
their
former
masters
the
egyptians
indeed
absorbed
in
their
civil
discords
or
in
wars
with
foreign
nations
soon
forgot
their
escaped
slaves
and
never
troubled
themselves
for
centuries
over
what
had
become
of
the
poor
wretches
until
in
the
reign
of
the
ptolemies
when
they
had
learned
from
the
bible
something
of
the
people
of
god
they
began
to
seek
in
their
own
annals
for
traces
of
their
sojourn
in
egypt
and
of
their
departure
from
the
country
a
new
version
of
the
exodus
was
the
result
in
which
hebrew
tradition
was
clumsily
blended
with
the
materials
of
a
romance
of
which
amenôthes
iii
was
the
hero
his
minister
and
namesake
amenôthes
son
of
hâpû
left
ineffaceable
impressions
on
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
of
thebes
he
not
only
erected
the
colossal
figures
in
the
amenophium
but
he
constructed
the
chapel
at
deîr
which
was
afterwards
restored
in
ptolemaic
times
and
where
he
continued
to
be
worshipped
as
long
as
the
egyptian
religion
lasted
profound
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
magic
were
attributed
to
him
as
in
later
times
to
prince
khâmoîsît
son
of
ramses
ii
on
this
subject
he
wrote
certain
works
which
maintained
their
reputation
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
after
his
death
and
all
that
was
known
about
him
marked
him
out
for
the
important
part
he
came
to
play
in
those
romantic
stories
so
popular
among
the
egyptians
one
of
these
books
which
is
mentioned
in
several
religious
texts
is
preserved
in
the
the
pharaoh
in
whose
good
graces
he
lived
had
a
desire
we
are
informed
to
behold
the
gods
after
the
example
of
his
ancestor
horus
the
son
of
hâpû
or
informed
him
that
he
could
not
succeed
in
his
design
until
he
had
expelled
from
the
country
all
the
lepers
and
unclean
persons
who
contaminated
it
acting
on
this
information
he
brought
together
all
those
who
suffered
from
physical
defects
and
confined
them
to
the
number
of
eighty
thousand
in
the
quarries
of
tûrah
there
were
priests
among
them
and
the
gods
became
wrathful
at
the
treatment
to
which
their
servants
were
exposed
the
soothsayer
therefore
fearing
the
divine
anger
predicted
that
certain
people
would
shortly
arise
who
forming
an
alliance
with
the
unclean
would
together
with
them
hold
sway
in
egypt
for
thirteen
years
he
then
committed
suicide
but
the
king
nevertheless
had
compassion
on
the
outcasts
and
granted
to
them
for
their
exclusive
use
the
town
of
avaris
which
had
been
deserted
since
the
time
of
ahmosis
the
outcasts
formed
themselves
into
a
nation
under
the
rule
of
a
heliopolitan
priest
called
osarsyph
or
moses
who
gave
them
laws
mobilised
them
and
joined
his
forces
with
the
descendants
of
the
shepherds
at
jerusalem
the
pharaoh
amenôphis
taken
by
surprise
at
this
revolt
and
remembering
the
words
of
his
minister
amenôthes
took
flight
into
ethiopia
the
shepherds
in
league
with
the
unclean
burned
the
towns
sacked
the
temples
and
broke
in
pieces
the
statues
of
the
gods
they
forced
the
egyptian
priests
to
slaughter
even
their
sacred
animals
to
cut
them
up
and
cook
them
for
their
foes
who
ate
them
derisively
in
their
accustomed
feasts
amenôphis
returned
from
ethiopia
together
with
his
son
ramses
at
the
end
of
thirteen
years
defeated
the
enemy
driving
them
back
into
syria
where
the
remainder
of
them
became
later
on
the
jewish
nation
a

of
the
pharaohs
after
aï
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
make
them
out
is
here
given
illustration
table
this
is
but
a
romance
in
which
a
very
little
history
is
mingled
with
a
great
deal
of
fable
the
scribes
as
well
as
the
people
were
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
egypt
had
been
in
danger
of
dissolution
at
the
time
when
the
hebrews
left
the
banks
of
the
nile
but
they
were
ignorant
of
the
details
of
the
precise
date
and
of
the
name
of
the
reigning
pharaoh
a
certain
similarity
in
sound
suggested
to
them
the
idea
of
assimilating
the
prince
whom
the
chroniclers
called
menepthes
or
amenepthes
with
amenophis
iii
and
they
gave
to
the
pharaoh
of
the
xixth
dynasty
the
minister
who
had
served
under
a
king
of
the
xviiith
they
metamorphosed
at
the
same
time
the
hebrews
into
lepers
allied
with
the
shepherds
from
this
strange
combination
there
resulted
a
narrative
which
at
once
fell
in
with
the
tastes
of
the
lovers
of
the
marvellous
and
was
a
sufficient
substitute
for
the
truth
which
had
long
since
been
forgotten
as
in
the
case
of
the
egyptians
of
the
greek
period
we
can
see
only
through
a
fog
what
took
place
after
the
deaths
of
mînephtah
and
seti
ii
we
know
only
for
certain
that
the
chiefs
of
the
nomes
were
in
perpetual
strife
with
each
other
and
that
a
foreign
power
was
dominant
in
the
country
as
in
the
time
of
apôphis
the
days
of
the
empire
would
have
harmhabî

belonged
to
the
xviiith
dynasty
for
he
modelled
the
form
of
his
cartouches
on
those
of
the
ahmesside
pharaohs
the
xixth
dynasty
began
only
in
all
probability
with
ramses
but
the
course
of
the
history
has
compelled
me
to
separate
harmhabî
from
his
predecessors
not
knowing
the
length
of
the
reigns
we
can
not
determine
the
total
duration
of
the
dynasty
we
shall
not
however
be
far
wrong
in
assigning
to
it
a
length
of

thereabouts

somewhere
near

numbered
if
a
deliverer
had
not
promptly
made
his
appearance
the
direct
line
of
ramses
ii
was
extinct
but
his
innumerable
sons
by
innumerable
concubines
had
left
a
posterity
out
of

some
at

might
have
the
requisite
ability
and
zeal
if
not

save
the
empire
at

lengthen
its
duration

set
out
some
five
centuries
before
this
for
the
conquest
of
the

had
at

smiled
upon
her
enterprise

thûtmosis

with

up
to
oppose

her
ambition
neither
the

been
able
to
restore
her
prestige

her
rivals
had
robbed
her
beyond
her
ancient
frontier

was

was
in

how
to
keep

and
as
in
a
former
crisis
egypt
once
more
owed
her
salvation
to
a
scion
of
the
old
theban
race
a
descendant
of
seti
or
ramses
named
nakhtûsît
rallied
round
him
the
forces
of
the
southern
nomes
and
succeeded
though
not
without
difficulty
in
dispossessing
the
syrian
arisû
he
arose
he
was
like
sûtkhû
providing
for
all
the
necessities
of
the
country
which
for
feebleness
could
not
stand
killing
the
rebels
which
were
in
the
delta
purifying
the
great
throne
of
egypt
he
was
regent
of
the
two
lands
in
the
place
of
tûmû
setting
himself
to
reorganise
that
which
had
been
overthrown
to
such
good
purpose
that
each
one
recognised
as
brethren
those
who
had
been
separated
from
him
as
by
a

so
long
a

strengthening
the

by

so
that
the
traditional
rites
could
be
celebrated
at
the
divine
the
exact
relationship
between
nakhtûsît
and
ramses
ii
is
not
known
he
was
probably
the
grandson
or
of
that
sovereign
though
ed
meyer
thinks
he
was
perhaps
the
son
of
seti
ii
the
name
should
be
read
either
nakhîtsît
with
the
singular
of
the
first
word
composing
it
or
nakhîtûsît
nakhtûsît
with
the
plural
as
in
the
analogous
name
of
the
king
of
the
xxxth
dynasty
nectanebo
many
were
the
difficulties
that
he
had
to
encounter
before
he
could
restore
to
his
country
that
peace
and
wealth
which
she
had
enjoyed
under
the
long
reign
of
sesostris
it
seems
probable
that
his
advancing
years
made
him
feel
unequal
to
the
task
or
that
he
desired
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
disturbances
in
the
event
of
his
sudden
death
at
all
events
he
associated
with
himself
on
the
throne
his
eldest
son
ramses
not
however
as
a
pharaoh
who
had
full
rights
to
the
crown
like
the
coadjutors
of
the
amenemhâîts
and
usirtasens
but
as
a
prince
invested
with
extraordinary
powers
after
the
example
of
the
sons
of
the
pharaohs
thûtmosis
and
seti
ramses
recalls
with
pride
towards
the
close
of
his
life
how
his
father
promoted
him
to
the
dignity
of
to
the
throne
of
sibû
and
how
he
had
been
acclaimed
as
supreme
head
of
qimît
for
the
administration
of
the
whole
earth
united
this
constituted
the
rise
of
a
new
dynasty
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
the
last
however
which
was
able
to
retain
the
supremacy
of
egypt
over
the
oriental
world
we
are
unable
to
ascertain
how
long
this
double
reign
lasted
the
only
certain
monument
that
we
as
yet
possess
of
this
double
reign

fully

within

had
no
leisure
either
to
build
or
to
restore
any
monuments
on
his
death
as
no
tomb
had
been
prepared

him
his
mummy
was
buried

attributes
to
him
the
construction
of
one
of
the
doors
of
the
temple
of
mût
at
karnak
it
would
appear
that
there
is
a
confusion
in
his
notes
between
the
prenomen
of
this
sovereign
and
that
of
seti
who
actually
did
decorate
one
of
the
doorways
of
that
temple
nakhûsît
must
have
also
worked
on
the
temple
of
phtah
at

his
cartouche
is
met
with
on
a
statue
originally
dedicated
by
a
pharaoh
of
the
xiith
dynasty
discovered
at
he
was
soon
forgotten
and
but
few
traces
of
his
services
survived
him
his
name
was
subsequently
removed
from
the
official
list
of
the
kings
while
others
not
so
deserving
as
he
as
for
instance
and
amenmesis
were
honourably
inscribed
in
it
the
memory
of
his
son
overshadowed
his
own
and
the
series
of
the
legitimate
kings
who
formed
the
xxth
dynasty
did
not
include
him
ramses
iii
took
for
his
hero
his
namesake
ramses
the
great
and
endeavoured
to
rival
him
in
everything
this
spirit
of
imitation
was
at
times
the
means
of
leading
him
to
commit
somewhat
puerile
acts
as
for
example
when
he
copied
certain
triumphal
inscriptions
word
for
word
merely
changing
the
dates
and
the
cartouches
or
when
he
assumed
the
prenomen
of
usirmârî
and
distributed
among
his
male
children
the
names
and
dignities
of
the
sons
of
sesostris
we
see
moreover
at
his
court
another
high
priest
of
phtah
at
memphis
bearing
the
name
of
khâmoîsît
and
marîtûmû
another
supreme
pontiff
of
râ
in
heliopolis
however
this
ambition
to
resemble
his
ancestor
at
once
instigated
him
to
noble
deeds
and
gave
him
the
necessary
determination
to
accomplish
them
thus
the
great
decree
of
carved
by
ramses
ii
in
the
year
xxxv
on
the
rocks
of
abu
simbel
was
copied
by
ramses
iii
at
in
the
year
xii
he
began
by
restoring
order
in
the
administration
of
affairs
established
truth
crushed
error
purified
the
temple
from
all
crime
and
made
his
authority
felt
not
only
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
nile
valley
but
in
what
was
still
left
of
the
asiatic
provinces
the
disturbances
of
the
preceding
years
had
weakened
the
prestige
of
and
the
supremacy
would
have
been
seriously
endangered
had
any
one
arisen
in
syria
of
sufficient
energy
to
take
advantage
of
the
existing
state
of
affairs
but
since
the
death
of
khâtusaru
the
power
of
the
khâti
had
considerably
declined
and
they
retained
their
position
merely
through
their
former
prestige
they
were
in
as
much
need
of
peace
or
even
more
so
than
the
egyptians
for
the
same
discords
which
had
harassed
the
reigns
of
seti
ii
and
his
successors
had
doubtless
brought
trouble
to
their
own
sovereigns
they
had
made
no
serious
efforts
to
extend
their
dominion
over
any
of
those
countries
which
had
been
the
objects
of
the
cupidity
of
their
forefathers
while
the
peoples
of
kharu
and
phoenicia
thrown
back
on
their
own
resources
had
not
ventured
to
take
up
arms
against
the
pharaoh
the
yoke
lay
lightly
upon
them
and
in
no
way
hampered
their
internal
liberty
they
governed
as
they
liked
they
exchanged
one
prince
or
chief
for
another
they
waged
petty
wars
as
of
old
without
as
a
rule
exposing
themselves
to
interference
from
the
egyptian
troops
occupying
the
country
or
from
the
these
vassal
provinces
had
probably
ceased
to
pay
tribute
or
had
done
so
irregularly
during
the
years
of
anarchy
following
the
death
of
siphtah
but
they
had
taken
no
concerted
action
nor
attempted
any
revolt
so
that
when
ramses
iii
ascended
the
throne
he
was
spared
the
trouble
of
reconquering
them
he
had
merely
to
claim
allegiance
to
have
it
at
once
rendered
him
an
allegiance
which
included
the
populations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
qodshû
and
on
the
banks
of
the
nahr
the
empire
which
had
threatened
to
fall
to
pieces
amid
the
civil
wars
and
which
would
indeed
have
succumbed
had
they
continued
a
few
years
longer
again
revived
now
that
an
energetic
prince
had
been
found
to
resume
the
direction
of
affairs
and
to
weld
together
those
elements
which
had
been
on
the
point
of
disintegration
one
state
alone
appeared
to
regret
the
revival
of
the
imperial
power
this
was
the
kingdom
of
libya
it
had
continued
to
increase
in
size
since
the
days
of
mînephtah
and
its
population
had
been
swelled
by
the
annexation
of
several
strange
tribes
inhabiting
the
vast
area
of
the
sahara
one
of
these
the
mashaûasha
acquired
the
ascendency
among
these
desert
races
owing
to
their
numbers
and
valour
and
together
with
the
other
tribes
the
sabati
the
kaiakasha
the
shaîû
the
hasa
the
bikana
and
the
formed
a
confederacy
which
now
threatened
egypt
on
the
west
this
federation
was
conducted
by
didi
mashaknû
and
mâraîû
all
children
of
that
mâraîû
who
had
led
the
first
libyan
invasion
and
also
by
zamarû
and
zaûtmarû
two
princes
of
less
important
tribes
their
combined
forces
had
attacked
egypt
for
the
second
time
during
the
years
of
anarchy
and
had
gained
possession
one
after
another
of
all
the
towns
in
the
west
of
the
delta
from
the
neighbourhood
of
memphis
to
the
town
of
qarbîna
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
now
formed
the
limit
of
their
dominion
and
they
often
crossed
it
to
devastate
the
central
provinces
this
enumeration
is
furnished
by
the
summary
of
the
campaigns
of
ramses
iii
in
great
harris
the
sabati
of
this
text
are
probably
identical
with
the
people
of
the
sapudiu
or
spudi
asbytse
mentioned
on
one
of
the
pylons
of
the
relationship
is
nowhere
stated
but
it
is
thought
to
be
probable
from
the
names
of
didi
and
mâraîû
repeated
in
both
series
of
inscriptions
the
town
of
qarbîna
has
been
identified
with
the
canopus
of
the
greeks
and
also
with
the
modern
korbani
and
the
district
of
gautu
which
adjoined
it
with
the
territory
of
the
modern
town
of
edkô
throws
doubt
on
the
identification
of
qarbu
or
qarbîna
with
canopus
révillout
prefers
to
connect
qarbîna
with
heracleopolis
parva
in
lower
egypt
nakhtûsîti
had
been
unable
to
drive
them
out
and
ramses
had
not
ventured
on
the
task
immediately
after
his
accession
the
military
institutions
of
the
country
had
become
totally
disorganised
after
the
death
of
mînephtah
and
that
part
of
the
community
responsible
for
furnishing
the
army
with
recruits
had
been
so
weakened
by
the
late
troubles
that
they
were
in
a
worse
condition
than
before
the
first
libyan
invasion
the
losses
they
had
suffered
since
egypt
began
its
foreign
conquests
had
not
been
repaired
by
the
introduction
of
fresh
elements
and
the
hope
of
spoil
was
now
insufficient
to
induce
members
of
the
upper
classes
to
enter
the
army
there
was
no
difficulty
in
filling
the
ranks
from
the
fellahîn
but
the
middle
class
and
the
aristocracy
accustomed
to
ease
and
wealth
no
longer
came
forward
in
large
numbers
and
disdained
the
military
profession
it
was
the
fashion
in
the
schools
to
contrast
the
calling
of
a
scribe
with
that
of
a
or
a
charioteer
and
to
make
as
merry
over
the
discomforts
of
a
military
occupation
as
it
had
formerly
been
the
fashion
to
extol
its
glory
and
profitableness

while

the

doubtless
has
a
moment
of

of
flattered
vanity
when
he
receives
according

a

and

with

of
the
warlike
spirit
in
all
classes
of
society
had
entailed
serious
modifications
in
the
organisation
of
both
army
and
navy
the
native
element
no
longer
predominated
in
most
battalions
and
on
the
majority
of
vessels
as
it
had
done
under
the
xviiith
dynasty
it
still
furnished
those
formidable
companies
of
archers
the
terror
of
both
africans
and
asiatics
and
also
the
most
important
part
if
not
the
whole
of
the
chariotry
but
the
main
body
of
the
infantry
was
composed
almost
exclusively
of
mercenaries
particularly
of
the
shardana
and
the
qahaka
ramses
began
his
reforms
by
rebuilding
the
fleet
which
in
a
country
like
egypt
was
always
an
artificial
creation
liable
to
fall
into
decay
unless
a
strong
and
persistent
effort
were
made
to
keep
it
in
an
efficient
condition
shipbuilding
had
made
considerable
progress
in
the
last
few
centuries
perhaps
from
the
impulse
received
through
phoenicia
and
the
vessels
turned
out
of
the
dockyards
were
far
superior
to
those
constructed
under
hâtshopsîtû
the
general
outlines
of
the
hull
remained
the
same
but
the
stem
and
stern
were
finer
and
not
so
high
out
of
the
water
the
bow
ended
moreover
in
a
head
of
metal
which
rose
above
the
a
wooden
structure
running
between
the
forecastle
and
protected
the
rowers
during
the
fight
their
heads
alone
being
exposed
the
mast
had
only
one
curved
yard
to
which
the
sail
was
fastened
this
was
run
up
from
the
deck
by
halyards
when
the
sailors
wanted
to
make
sail
and
thus
differed
from
the
egyptian
arrangement
where
the
sail
was
fastened
to
a
fixed
upper
yard
at
least
half
of
the
crews
consisted
of
libyan
prisoners
who
were
branded
with
a
hot
iron
like
cattle
to
prevent
desertion
the
remaining
half
was
drawn
from
the
syrian
or
asiatic
coast
or
else
were
natives
of
egypt
in
order
to
bring
the
army
into
better
condition
ramses
revived
the
system
of
classes
which
empowered
him
to
compel
all
egyptians
of
unmixed
race
to
take
personal
service
while
he
hired
mercenaries
from
libya
phoenicia
asia
minor
and
wherever
he
could
get
them
and
divided
them
into
regular
regiments
according
to
their
extraction
and
the
arms
that
they
bore
in
the
field
the
archers
always
headed
the
column
to
meet
the
advance
of
the
foe
with
their
arrows
they
were
followed
by
the
egyptian
lancers
the
shardana
and
the
tyrseni
with
their
short
spears
and
heavy
bronze
swords
while
a
corps
of
veterans
armed
with
heavy
maces
brought
up
the
rear
in
an
engagement
these
various
troops
formed
three
lines
of
infantry
disposed
one
behind
the
other
the
light
brigade
in
front
to
engage
the
adversary
the
swordsmen
and

who
were
to
come
into
close
quarters
with
the
foe
and
the
in
reserve
ready
to
advance
on
any
threatened
point
or
to
await
the
critical
moment
when
their
intervention
would
decide
the
victory
as
in
the
times
of
thûtmosis
and
ramses
ii
the
chariotry
covered
the
two
wings
this
is
the
order
of
march
represented
during
the
syrian
campaign
as
gathered
from
the
arrangement
observed
in
the
pictures
at
it
was
well
for
ramses
that
on
ascending
the
throne
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
task
of
recruiting
the
egyptian
army
and
of
personally
and
carefully
superintending
the
instruction
and
equipment
of
his
men
for
it
was
thanks
to
these
precautions
that
when
the
confederated
libyans
attacked
the
country
about
the
vth
year
of
his
reign
he
was
enabled
to
repulse
them
with
complete
success
mashaknû
maraîû
together
with
zamarû
and
zaûtmarû
had
strongly
urged
them
to
attack
egypt
and
to
carry
fire
before
them
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
warriors
confided
to
each
other
in
their
counsels
and
their
hearts
were
full
will
be
drunk
and
their
princes
said
within
their
breasts
will
fill
our
hearts
with
violence
but
their
plans
were
overthrown
thwarted
broken
against
the
heart
of
the
god
and
the
prayer
of
their
chief
which
their
lips
repeated
was
not
granted
by
the
they
met
the
egyptians
at
a
place
called
repulses
the
but
their
attack
was
broken
by
the
latter
who
were
ably
led
and
displayed
considerable
valour
bleated
like
goats
surprised
by
a
bull
who
stamps
its
foot
who
pushes
forward
its
horn
and
shakes
the
mountains
charging
whoever
seeks
to
annoy
they
fled
afar
howling
with
fear
and
many
of
them
in
endeavouring
to
escape
their
pursuers
perished
in
the
canals
is
said
they
breaking
of
our
spines
which
threatens
us
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
its
lord
destroys
our
souls
for
ever
and
ever
woe
be
upon
them
for
they
have
seen
their
dances
changed
into
carnage
sokhît
is
behind
them
fear
weighs
upon
them
we
march
no
longer
upon
roads
where
we
can
walk
but
we
run
across
fields
all
the
fields
and
their
soldiers
did
not
even
need
to
measure
arms
with
us
in
the
struggle
pharaoh
alone
was
our
destruction
a
fire
against
us
every
time
that
he
willed
it
and
no
sooner
did
we
approach
than
the
flame
curled
round
us
and
no
water
could
quench
it
on
the
victory
was
a
brilliant
one
the
victors
counted
of
the
enemy
killed
and
many
more
who
surrendered
at
discretion
the
latter
were
formed
into
a
brigade
and
were
distributed
throughout
the
valley
of
the
nile
in
military
settlements
they
submitted
to
their
fate
with
that
resignation
which
we
know
to
have
been
a
characteristic
of
the
vanquished
at
that
date
the
number
of
the
dead
is
calculated
from
that
of
the
hands
and
phalli
brought
in
by
the
soldiers
after
the
victory
the
heaps
of
which
are
represented
at
they
regarded
their
defeat
as
a
judgment
from
god
against
which
there
was
no
appeal
when
their
fate
had
been
once
pronounced
nothing
remained
to
the
condemned
except
to
submit
to
it
humbly
and
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
master
to
whom
they
were
now
bound
by
a
decree
from
on
high
the
prisoners
of
one
day
became
on
the
next
the
devoted
soldiers
of
the
prince
against
whom
they
had
formerly
fought
resolutely
and
they
were
employed
against
their
own
tribes
their
employers
having
no
fear
of
their
deserting
to
the
other
side
during
the
engagement
they
were
lodged
in
the
barracks
at
thebes
or
in
the
provinces
under
the
feudal
lords
and
governors
of
the
pharaoh
and
were
encouraged
to
retain
their
savage
customs
and
warlike
spirit
they
intermarried
either
with
the
fellahîn
or
with
women
of
their
own
tribes
and
were
reinforced
at
intervals
by
fresh
prisoners
or
volunteers
drafted
principally
into
the
delta
and
the
cities
of
middle
egypt
they
thus
ended
by
constituting
a
population
destined
by
nature
and
training
to
the
calling
of
arms
and
forming
a
sort
of
warrior
caste
differing
widely
from
the
militia

former
times

known
for
many
generations
by
their
national
name
of
mashaûasha
as
early
as
the
xiith
dynasty
the
pharaohs

in

resolved
to
naturalise
the
libyans
for
much
the

purpose
his
victory
did
not
bear
the

doubtless
desired
to
have
the
sole
credit
of
the
victory
over
the
libyans
he
certainly
did
overcome
their
kings
and
arrested
their
invasion
we
may
go
so
far
as
to
allow
that

wrested
from
them
the
provinces
which
they
had
occupied
on
the
left

of

to

and
easterly
direction
was
beginning
to
be
felt
by
the
inhabitants
of

were
forced
to
set
out
in

crossing

the
nations
who
had
hitherto
inhabited
these
regions
now
found
themselves
thrust
forward
by
the
pressure
of
invading
hordes
and
were
constrained
to
move
towards
the

east
by
every
avenue

presented
itself

was
probably
the
irruption
of

the

of

the

to

with

prefer
to
attribute
to
them
a
libyan
origin
but
the
latter
finally
returns
to
the
pelasgic
and
philistine
hypothesis
they
were
without

the
philistines

was
at
this

the
seat
of
a
maritime
empire
whose
chiefs
were
perpetually
cruising
the
seas
and
harassing
the
civilized
states
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
these
had
grown
wealthy
through
piracy
and
contact
with
the
merchants
of
syria
and
egypt
had
awakened
in
them
a
taste
for
a
certain
luxury
and
refinement
of
which
we
find
no
traces
in
the
remains
of
their
civilization
anterior
to
this
period
some
of
the
symbols
in
the
inscriptions
found
on
their
monuments
recall
certain
of
the
egyptian
characters
while
others
present
an
original
aspect
and
seem
to
be
of
ægean
origin
we
find
in
them
arranged
in
juxtaposition
signs
representing
flowers
birds
fish
quadrupeds
of
various
kinds
members
of
the
human
body
and
boats
and
household
implements
from
the
little
which
is
known
of
this
script
we
are
inclined
to
derive
it
from
a
similar
source
to
that
which
has
furnished
those
we
meet
with
in
several
parts
of
asia
minor
and
northern
syria
it
would
appear
that
in
ancient
times
somewhere
in
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
but
under
what
influence
or
during
what
period
we
know
not
a
syllabary
was
developed
of
which
varieties
were
handed
on
from
tribe
to
tribe

on
the

side
to
the
hittites
cilicians

on
the
other
to
the
trojans
to
the
people
of
the
cyclades
and
into
crete
and
greece
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
the
pulasati
by
the
felt
helmet
which
they
wore
fastened
under
the
chin
by
two
straps
and
surmounted
by
a
crest
of
feathers
the
upper
part
of
their
bodies
was
covered
by
bands
of
leather
or
some
thick
material
below
which
hung
a
simple
while
their
feet
were
bare
or
shod
with
short
sandals
they
carried
each
a
round
buckler
with
two
handles
and
the
stout
bronze
sword
common
to
the
northern
races
suspended
by
a
cross
belt
passing
over
the
left
shoulder
and
were
further
armed
with
two
daggers
and
two
javelins
they
hurled
the
latter
from
a
short
distance
while
attacking
and
then
drawing
their
sword
or
daggers
fell
upon
the
enemy
we
find
among
them
a
few
chariots
of
the
hittite
type
each
manned
by
a
driver
and
two
fighting
men
the
tyrseni
appear
to
have
been
the
most
numerous
after
the
pulasati
next
to
whom
came
the
zakkala
the
latter
are
thought
to
have
been
a
branch
of
the
whom
greek
tradition
represents
as
scattered
at
this
period
among
the
cyclades
and
along
the
coast
of
the
hellespont
they
wore
a
casque
surmounted
with
plumes
like
that
of
the
pulasati
the
tyrseni
may
be
distinguished
by
their
feathered
but
the

a
long
ample
woollen
cap
falling
on
the
neck
behind
an
article
of
apparel
which
is
still
worn
by
the
sailors
of
the
archipelago
otherwise
they
were
equipped
in
much
the
same
manner
as
their
allies
the
other
members
of
the
confederation
the
shardana
the
danauna
and
the
nashasha
each
furnished
an
inconsiderable
contingent
and
taken
all
together
formed
but
a
small
item
of
the
united
force
the
zakkara
or
zakkala
have
been
identified
with
the
teucrians
by
lauth
chabas
and
fr
lenormant
with
the
zygritse
of
libya
by
linger
and
brugsch
who
subsequently
returned
to
the
teucrian
hypothesis
max
millier
regards
them
as
an
asiatic
nation
probably
of
the
lydian
family
the
identification
with
the
of
the
ægean
sea
was
proposed
by
maspero
the
form
of
the
word
shows
that
it
is
of
asiatic
origin

refers
us

sailed
along

without
doubt
those
of
the
two
peoples

in
many
respects
those

in
the
fact
that
they

up

managed

in
the

manner
as
the
egyptian

the
resemblance
between
this
fleet
and
that
of
ramses
is
easily
explained
the
dwellers
on
the
ægean
owing
to
the
knowledge
they
had
acquired
of
the
phoenician
galleys
which
were
accustomed
to
cruise
annually

the
remarks

differ
from

in
looking

not

seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that

enough
to
assign

were

were

twelve
members
summoned
expressly
to
try

the
result
was

execution

the
extreme
penalty
of
the
egyptian
code
was
reserved

for
the
most
culpable
died

themselves

the
meaning
of

phrase
is
indicated
i

by
the
appearance
of

mummies
disinterred

the
coffin
in

it
was

was
very
plain

it
is
also

make

of
the

of

willing
for

unfortunately
no

is
to
be

frightful
punishment

the
recurrence
of

wicked
plots
pharaoh
resolved
to
share
his
throne
with
that
one
of
his
sons
who
had
most
right
to
it
in
the
xxxiind
year
of
his
reign
he
called
together
his
military
and
civil
chiefs
the
generals
of
the
foreign
mercenaries
the
shardana
the
priests
and
the
nobles
of
the
court
and
presented
to
them
according
to
custom
his
who
was
also
called
ramses
he
placed
the
double
crown
upon
his
brow
and
seated
him
beside
himself
upon
the
throne
of
horus
this
was
an
occasion
for
the
pharaoh
to
bring
to
remembrance
all
the
great
exploits
he
had
performed
during
his
reign
his
triumphs
over
the
libyans
and
over
the
peoples
of
the
sea
and
the
riches
he
had
lavished
upon
the
gods
at
the
end
of
the
enumeration
he
exhorted
those
who
were
present
to
observe
the
same
fidelity
towards
the
son
which
they
had
observed
towards
the
father
and
to
serve
the
new
sovereign
as
valiantly
as
they
had
served
himself

may
be
extended

it
was
evidently
and
designedly
an
imitation
of
the
reign
of
ramses
il
but
fell
short
of
its
model
owing
to
the
insufficiency
of
his
resources
in
men
and
money
if
ramses
iii
did
not
succeed
in
becoming
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
theban
pharaohs
it
was
not
for
lack
of
energy
or
ability
the
depressed
condition
of
egypt
at
the
time
limited
the
success
of
his
endeavours
and
caused
them
to
fall
short
of
his
intentions
the
work
accomplished
by
him
was
not
on
this
account
less
glorious
at
his
accession
egypt
was
in
a
wretched
state
invaded
on
the
west
threatened
by
a
flood
of
barbarians
on
the
east
without
an
army
or
a
fleet
and
with
no
resources
in
the
treasury
in
fifteen
years
he
had
disposed
of
his
inconvenient
neighbours
organised
an
army
constructed
a
fleet
his
authority
abroad
and
settled
the
administration
at
home
on
so
firm
a
basis
that
the
country
owed
the
peace
which
it
enjoyed
for
several
centuries
to
the
institutions
and
prestige
which
he
had
given
it
his
associate
in
the
government
ramses
barely
survived
him
then
followed
a
series
of
bearing
the
name
of
ramses
but
in
an
order
not
yet
clearly
determined
it
is
generally
assumed
that
ramses
brother
of
ramses
succeeded
ramses
iv
by
supplanting
his
nephews
who
however
appear
to
have
soon
their
claim
to
the
throne
and
to
have
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
as
ramses
ramses
vil
ramses
and
maritûmû
others
endeavour
to
make
out
that
ramses
was
the
son
of
ramses
and
that
the
prince
called
ramses
vi
never
succeeded
to
the
throne
at
all
at
any
rate
his
son
who
is
styled
ramses
vil
but
who
is
asserted
by
some
to
have
been
a
son
of
ramses
is
considered
to
have
succeeded
ramses
and
to
have
become
the
ancestor
from
whom
the
later
ramessides
traced
their
descent
the

of
the
ramessides

made

the

rare

so
doubtful
that
i
can
not

my

a
solution
of
the
questions

they
raise
the
short
reigns
of
these
pharaohs

marked
by
no
events
which
would
cast
lustre
on
their
names
one
might
say
that
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
enjoy
peacefully
the
riches
accumulated
by
their
forefather
ramses
iv
was
anxious
to
profit
by
the
commercial
relations
which
had
been
again
established
between
egypt
and
puanît
and
in
order
to
facilitate
the
transit
between
coptos
and
kosseir
founded
a
station
and
a
temple
dedicated
to
isis
in
the
mountain
of
bakhni
by
this
route
we
learn
more
than
eight
thousand
men
had
passed
under
the
auspices
of
the
high
priest
of
amon
this
is
the
only
undertaking
of
public
utility
which
we
can
attribute
to
any
of
these
kings
as
we
see
them
in
their
statues
and
portraits
they
are
heavy
and
squat
and
without
refinement
with
protruding
eyes
thick
lips
flattened
and
commonplace
noses
round
and
expressionless
faces
their
work
was
confined
to
the
engraving
of
their
cartouches
on
the
blank
spaces
of
the
temples
at
karnak
and
and
the
addition
of
a
few
stones
to
the
buildings
at
memphis
abydos
and
heliopolis
whatever
energy
and
means
they
possessed
were
expended
on
the
construction
of
their
magnificent
tombs

biban
and
no
visitor
can
refrain
from
admiring
them
for
their
magnitude
and
decoration

to
funerary
chapels
owing
to
the
shortness
of
the
reigns
of
these
kings
there
was
not

to
construct
them

they
therefore
made
up
for
this
want

appropriating
the
chapel
of

was
at

arrive
at

recorded
as
representing
so
much
tribute
if
it
is
true
that
a

egypt
ought
to
be
reckoned
as

fortunate

passed
the
greater
part
of
their
lives

here
in

valley
of
sepulchres

were
laid
to
rest
when
their
reigns

lives
were
ended
the
small
city
of
the
beginning
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
had
long
encroached
upon
the
plain
and
was
now
transformed
into
an
immense
town
with
magnificent
monuments
and
a
motley
population
having
absorbed
in
its
extension
the
villages
of
ashirû
and
madit
and
even
the
southern

which
we
now
call
luxor

their
walls
could
still
be
seen
rising
up
in

middle
of
modern
constructions
a
memorial
of
the
heroic
ages
when
the
power
of
the
theban
princes
was
trembling
in
the
balance
and
when
conflicts
with
the
neighbouring
barons
or
with
the
legitimate
king
were
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
at
every
moment
the
village
of
ashirû
was
situated
to
the
south

us
that

that

a
continuous
infusion

foreign
material
into
the
ancient
theban

rise
to
families

mixed
character

which
all

must
have
presented
as

an
aspect
in
this
respect
as
thebes
at
memphis
there
were
regular
colonies
of
phoenician
canaanite

amorite
merchants
sufficiently
prosperous

have

new
elements
introduced
among
the
people
by
the
political
movements
of
the
later
centuries
is
thus
strongly
confirmed
the
had
all
been
absorbed
and
assimilated
by
the
country
but
the
generations
which
arose
from
this
continual
while
representing
externally
the
egyptians
of
older
epochs
in
manners
language
and
religion
were
at
bottom
something
different
and
the
difference
became
the
more
accentuated
as
the
foreign
elements
increased
the
people
were
thus
gradually
divested
of
the
character
which
had
distinguished
them
before
the
conquest
of
syria
the
dispositions
and
defects
imported
from
without
counteracted
to
such
an
extent
their
own
native
dispositions
and
defects
that
all
marks
of
individuality
were
effaced
and
nullified
the
race
tended
to
become
more
and
more
what
it
long
continued
to
be
afterwards
a
lifeless
and
inert
mass
without
individual
energy
endowed
it
is
true
with
patience
endurance
cheerfulness
of
temperament
and
good
nature
but
with
little
power
of
and
thus
forced
to
submit
to
foreign
masters
who
made
use
of
it
and
oppressed
it
without
pity
the
upper
classes
had
degenerated
as
much
as
the
masses
the
feudal
nobles
who
had
expelled
the
shepherds
and
carried
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
to
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
seemed
to
have
expended
their
energies
in
the
effort
and
to
have
almost
ceased
to
exist
as
long
as
egypt
was
restricted
to
the
nile
valley
there
was
no
such
disproportion
between
the
power
of
the
pharaoh
and
that
of
his
feudatories
as
to
prevent
the
latter
from
maintaining
their
privileges
beside
and
when
occasion
arose
even
against
the
monarch
the
conquest
of
asia
while
it
compelled
them
either
to
take
up
arms
themselves
or
to
send
their
troops
to
a
distance
accustomed
them
and
their
soldiers
to
a
passive
obedience
the
maintenance
of
a
strict
discipline
in
the
army
was
the
first
condition
of
successful
campaigning
at
great
distances
from
the
mother
country
and
in
the
midst
of
hostile
people
and
the
unquestioning
respect
which
they
had
to
pay
to
the
orders
of
their
general
prepared
them
for
abject
submission
to
the
will
of
their
sovereign
to
their
bravery
moveover
they
owed
not
only
money
and
slaves
but
also
necklaces
and
bracelets
of
honour
and
distinctions
and
offices
in
the
pharaonic
administration
the
king
in
addition
neglected
no
opportunity
for
securing
their
devotion
to
himself
he
gave
to
them
in
marriage
his
sisters
his
daughters
his
cousins
and
any
of
the
princesses
whom
he
was
not
compelled
by
law
to
make
his
own
wives
he
selected
from
their
harems
for
his
own
sons
and
this
choice
established
between
him
and
them
a
foster
relationship
which
was
as
binding
among
the
egyptians
and
other
oriental
peoples
as
one
of
blood
it
was
not
even
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
this
relation
that
the
connexion
with
the
son
should
be
durable
or
even
effective
the
woman
had
only
to
offer
her
breast
to
the
child
for
a
moment
and
this
symbol
was
quite
enough
to
make
her
his
nurse
his
true
this
fictitious
fosterage
was
carried
so
far
that
it
was
even
made
use
of
in
the
case
of
youths
and
persons
of
mature
age
when
an
egyptian
woman
wished
to
adopt
an
adult
the
law
prescribed
that
she
should
offer
him
the
breast
and
from
that
moment
he
became
her
son
a
similar
ceremony
was
prescribed
in
the
case
of
men
who
wished
to
assume
the
quality
of
male
nurse
or
even
indeed
of
female
nurse
like
that
of
their
wives
according
to
which
they
were
to
place
it
would
seem
the
end
of
one
of
their
fingers
in
the
mouth
of
the
child
once
this
affinity
was
established
the
fidelity
of
these
feudal
lords
was
established
beyond
question
and
their
official
duties
to
the
sovereign
were
not
considered
as
accomplished
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
military
obligations
for
they
continued
to
serve
him
in
the
palace
as
they
had
served
him
on
the
field
wherever
the
necessities
of
the
government
called
them
at
memphis
at
ramses
or
elsewhere
they
assembled
around
the
pharaoh
like
him
they
had
their
palaces
at
thebes
and
when
they
died
they
were
anxious
to
be
buried
there
beside
him
these
symbolical
modes
of
adoption
were
first
pointed
out
by
maspero
legend
has
given
examples
of
them
as
for
instance
where
isis
fosters
the
child
of
malkander
king
of
byblos
by
inserting
the
tip
of
her
finger
in
its
mouth
the
tomb
of
a
prince
of
tobûî
the
lesser
aphroditopolis
was
discovered
at
thebes
by
maspero
the
tombs
of
two
thinite
princes
were
noted
in
the
same
necropolis
these
two
were
of
the
time
of
thûtmosis
iii
i
have
remarked
in
tombs
not
yet
made
public
the
mention
of
princes
of
who
played
an
important
part
about
the
person
of
the
pharaohs
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
xxth
dynasty
many
of
the
old
houses
had
become
extinct
while
others
owing
to
marriages
were
absorbed
into
the
royal
family
the
fiefs
conceded
to
the
relations
or
favourites
of
the
pharaoh
continued
to
exist
indeed
as
of
old
but
the
ancient
distrustful
and
turbulent
feudality
had
given
place
to
an
aristocracy
of
courtiers
who
lived
oftener
in
attendance
on
the
monarch
than
on
their
own
estates
and
whose
authority
continued
to
diminish
to
the
profit
of
the
absolute
rule
of
the
king
there
would
be
nothing
astonishing
in
the
becoming
nothing
more
than
a
governor
hereditary
or
otherwise
in
thebes
itself
he
could
hardly
be
anything
higher
in
the
capital
of
the
empire
but
the
same
restriction
of
authority
was
evidenced
in
all
the
provinces
the
recruiting
of
soldiers
the
receipt
of
taxes
most
of
the
offices
associated
with
the
civil
or
military
administration
became
more
and
more
affairs
of
the
state
and
passed
from
the
hands
of
the
feudal
lord
into
those
of
the
functionaries
of
the
crown
the
few
barons
who
still
lived
on
their
estates
while
they
were
thus
dispossessed
of
the
greater
part
of
their
prerogatives
obtained
some
compensation
on
the
other
hand
on
the
side
of
religion
from
early
times
they
had
been
by
birth
the
heads
of
the
local
cults
and
their
protocol
had
contained
together
with
those
titles
which
justified
their
possession
of
the
temporalities
of
the
nome
others
which
attributed
to
them
spiritual
supremacy
the
sacred
character
with
which
they
were
invested
became
more
and
more
prominent
in
proportion
as
their
political
influence
became
curtailed
and
we
find
scions
of
the
old
warlike
families
or
representatives
of
a
new
lineage
at
thinis
at
akhmîm
in
the
nome
of
baalû
at
hierâconpolis
at
and
in
every
place
where
we
have
information
from
the
monuments
as
to
their
position
bestowing
more
concern
upon
their
sacerdotal
than
on
their
other
duties
rakhmirî
and
his
son
manakhpirsonbû
were
both
thebes
under
thûtmosis
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
any
other
person
among
them
invested
with
the
same
functions
and
belonging
to
a
different
family
for
example
the
tomb
of
anhûrimôsû
high
priest
of
and
prince
of
thinis
under
mînephtah
where
the
sacerdotal
character
is
almost
exclusively
prominent
the
same
is
the
case
with
the
tombs
of
the
princes
of
akhmîm
in
the
time
of
khûniatonû
and
his
successors
the
few
still
existing
in
have
not
been
published
the
stelæ
belonging
to
them
are
at
paris
and
berlin
horimôsû
prince
of
hierâconpolis
under
thûtmosis
is
above
everything
else
a
prophet
of
the
local
horus
the
princes
of
during
the
xixth
and
xxth
dynasties
were
before
everything
priests
of
nekhabit
as
appears
from
an
examination
of
their
tombs
which
lying
in
a
side
valley
far
away
from
the
tomb
of
pihirî
are
rarely
visited
this
transfiguration
of
the
functions
of
the
barons
which
had
been
completed
under
the
xixth
and
xxth
dynasties
corresponded
with
a
more
general
movement
by
which
the
pharaohs
themselves
were
driven
to
accentuate
their
official
position
as
high
priests
and
to
assign
to
their
sons
sacerdotal
functions
in
relation
to
the
principal
deities
this
rekindling
of
religious
fervour
would
not
doubtless
have
restrained
military
zeal
in
case
of
war
but
if
it
did
not
tend
to
suppress
entirely
individual
bravery
it
discouraged
the
taste
for
arms
and
for
the
bold
adventures
which
had
characterised
the
old
feudality
the
sons
of
ramses
khâmoîsît
and
marîtùmû
were
bravo
warriors
in
spite
of
their
being
high
priests
of
phtah
at
memphis
and
of
râ
at
heliopolis
the
duties
of
sacrificing
of
offering
prayer
of
celebrating
the
sacred
rites
according
to
the
prescribed
forms
and
rendering
due
homage
to
the
gods
in
the
manner
they
demanded
were
of
such
an
exactingly
scrupulous
and
complex
character
that
the
pharaohs
and
the
lords
of
earlier
times
had
to
assign
them
to
men
specially
fitted
for
and
appointed
to
the
task
now
that
they
had
assumed
these
absorbing
functions
themselves
they
were
obliged
to
delegate
to
others
an
increasingly
greater
proportion
of
their
civil
and
military
duties
thus
while
the
king
and
his
great
vassals
were
devoutly
occupying
themselves
in
matters
of
worship
and
theology
generals
by
profession
were
relieving
them
of
the
care
of
commanding
their
armies
and
as
these
individuals
were
frequently
the
chiefs
of
ethiopian
asiatic
and
especially
of
libyan
bands
military
authority
and
with
it
predominant
influence
in
the
state
were
quickly
passing
into
the
hands
of
the
barbarians
a
sort
of
aristocracy
of
veterans
notably
of
shardana
or
mashauasha
entirely
devoted
to
arms
grew
up
and
increased
gradually
side
by
side
with
the
ancient
noble
families
now
by
preference
devoted
to
the
priesthood
this
military
aristocracy
was
fully
developed
in
the
xxist
and
xxiind
dynasties
but
it
began
to
take
shape
after
ramses
iii
had
planted
the
shardana
and
qahaka
in
certain
towns
as
garrisons
the
barons
whether
of
ancient
or
modern
lineage
were
possessed
of
immense
wealth
especially
those
of
priestly
families
the
tribute
and
spoil
of
asia
and
africa
when
once
it
had
reached
egypt
hardly
ever
left
it
they
were
distributed
among
the
population
in
proportion
to
the
position
occupied
by
the
recipients
in
the
social
scale
the
commanders
of
the
troops
the
attendants
on
the
king
the
administrators
of
the
palace
and
temples
absorbed
the
greater
part
but
the
distribution
was
carried
down
to
the
private
soldier
and
his
relations
in
town
or
country
who
received
some
of
the
crumbs
when
we
remember
for
a
moment
the
four
centuries
and
more
during
which
egypt
had
been
reaping
the
fruits
of
her
foreign
conquest
we
can
not
think
without
amazement
of
the
quantities
of
gold
and
other
precious
metals
which
must
have
been
brought
in
divers
forms
into
the
valley
of
the
nile
every
fresh
expedition
made
additions
to
these
riches
and
one
is
at
a
loss
to
know
whence
in
the
intervals
between
two
defeats
the
conquered
could
procure
so
much
wealth
and
why
the
sources
were
never
exhausted
nor
became
impoverished
this
flow
of
metals
had
an
influence
upon
commercial
transactions
for
although
trade
was
still
mainly
carried
on
by
barter
the
mode
of
operation
was
becoming
changed
appreciably
in
exchanging
commodities
frequent
use
was
now
made
of
rings
and
ingots
of
a
certain
prescribed
weight
in
and
it
became
more
and
more
the
custom
to
pay
for
goods
by
a
certain
number
of
of
gold
silver
or
copper
rather
than
by
other
commodities
it
was
the
practice
even
to
note
down
in
invoices
or
in
the
official
receipts
alongside
the
products
or
manufactured
articles
with
which
payments
were
made
the
value
of
the
same
in
weighed
metal
the
quantity
of
gold
in
ingots
or
rings
mentioned
in
the
of
tkutmosis
represents
altogether
a
weight
of
nearly
a
ton
and
a
quarter
or
in
value
some
of
our
money
and
this
is
far
from
being
the
whole
of
the
metal
obtained
from
the
enemy
for
a
large
portion
of
the
inscription
has
disappeared
and
the
unrecorded
amount
might
be
taken
without
much
risk
of
error
at
as
much
as
that
of
which
we
have
evidence
say
some
two
and
a
half
tons
which
thûtmosis
had
received
or
brought
back
between
the
years
xxiii
and
xlii
of
his
reign
an
estimation
rather
under
than
over
the
reality
these
figures
moreover
take
no
account
of
the
vessels
and
statues
or
of
the
furniture
and
arms
plated
with
gold
silver
was
not
received
in
such
large
quantities
but
it
was
of
great
value
and
the
like
may
be
said
of
copper
and
lead
the
facts
justifying
this
position
were
observed
and
put
together
for
the
first
time
by
chabas
a
translation
is
given
in
his
memoir
of
a
register
of
the
xxth
or
xxist
dynasty
which
gives
the
price
of
meat
both
in
gold
and
silver
at
this
date
fresh
examples
have
been
since
collected
by
spiegelberg
who
has
succeeded
in
drawing
up
a
kind
of
tariff
for
the
period
between
the
xviiith
and
xxth
dynasties
this
custom
although
not
yet
widely
extended
placed
at
the
disposal
of
trade
enormous
masses
of
metal
which
were
preserved
in
the
form
of
ingots
or
bricks
except
the
portion
which
went
to
the
manufacture
of
rings

or
valuable
vessels

are
depicted
on
the
monuments

or
heaps
of
gold
dust
ingots
in
the
shape
of
bricks
rings
and
vases
arranged
alongside
each
other
the
general
prosperity
encouraged
a
passion
for
work
and
the
use
of
bracelets
necklaces
and
chains
became
common
among
classes
of
the
people
who
were
not
previously
accustomed
to
wear
them
there
was
henceforward
no
scribe
or
merchant
however
poor
he
might
be
who
had
not
his
seal
made
of
gold
or
silver
or
at
any
rate
of
copper
gilt
the
stone
was
sometimes
fixed
but
frequently
arranged
so
as
to
turn
round
on
a
pivot
while
among
people
of
superior
rank
it
had
some
emblem
or
device
upon
it
such
as
a
scorpion
a
a
lion
or
a
cynocephalous
monkey
chains
occupied
the
same
position
among
the
ornaments
of
egyptian
women
as
rings
among
men
they
were
indispensable
decorations
examples
of
silver
chains
are
known
of
some
five
feet
in
length
while
others
do
not
exceed
two
to
three
inches
there
are
specimens
in

of
all
sizes

with
large

the
poorest
peasant

alike
with
the
lady
of
the

could
boast
of
the
possession
of

poverty

what
degree
of

the
work

egyptian
goldsmiths
had
attained
at
the
time

the
expulsion
of

nyksôs
they
had
not

preserved
the
good
traditions
of
the
best

the

dull
blue
with
a
freedom
of
handling
and
a
skill
in
the
manipulation
of
colour
which
do
honour
to
the
artist
it
was
not
his
fault
if
there
is
still
an
element
of
stiffness

appearance
of
the
pectoral

a
whole

the
form
which
religious
tradition
had
imposed
upon
the
jewel
was
so
rigid
that
no
artifice
could
completely
get
over
this
defect
it
is
a
type
which
arose
out
of
the
same
mental
concepts
as
had
given
birth
to
egyptian
architecture
and
sculpture
monumental
in
character
and
appearing
often
as
if
designed
for
colossal
rather
than
ordinary
beings
the
dimensions
too
overpowering
for
the
decoration
of
normal
men

would
find
an
appropriate
place
only
on
the
breasts
of
gigantic
statues
the
enormous
size
of
the
stone
figures
to
which
alone
they
are
adapted
would
relieve
them
and
show
them
in
their
proper
proportions
the
artists
of
the
second
theban
empire
tried
all
they
could
however
to
get
rid
of
the
square
framework
in
which
the
sacred
bird
is
enclosed
and
we
find
examples
among
the
pectorals
in
the
louvre
of
the

curved
wings

of

the
wings
extended
but
in
both
of
them
there
is
displayed
the
same
brilliancy
the
same
purity
of
line
as
in
the
jewels
while
the
design
freed
from
the
trammels
of
the
hampering
enamelled
frame
takes
on
a
more
graceful
form
and
becomes
more
suitable

europe

egypt
it
is
of
the
finest
gold
but
its
value
does
not
depend
upon
the
precious
material
the
ancient
engraver
knew
how
to
model
it
with
a
bold
and
free
hand
and
he
has
managed
to
invest
it
with
as
much
dignity
as
if
he
had
been
carving
his
subject
in
heroic
size
out
of
a
block
of
granite
or
limestone
it
is
not
an
example
of
pure
industrial
art
but
of
an
art
for
which
a
designation
is
lacking
other
examples
although
more
carefully
executed
and
of
more
costly
materials
do
not
approach
it
in
value
such
for
instance
are
the
earrings
of

up
of
an
ostentatious
combination
of
disks

and
hanging
figures
of
the
urseus
to
get
an
idea
of
the
character
of
the
plate
on
the
royal
sideboards
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
sculptures
in
the
temples
or
to
the
paintings
on
the
tombs
the
engraved
gold
or
silver
centrepieces
dishes
bowls
cups

amphoras

valued
by
weight
only
were
too
precious

escape
the
avarice
of
the
impoverished
generations
which
followed
the
era
of
theban
prosperity
in
the
fabrication
of
these
we
can
trace
foreign
influences
but
not
to
the
extent
of
a
predominance
over
native
art
even
if
the
subject
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
artist
happened
to
be
a
phoenician
god
or
an
asiatic
prisoner
he
was
not
content
with
slavishly
copying
his
model
he
translated
it
and
interpreted
it
so
as
to
give
it
an
egyptian
character

the

the

considers
that
the
number

familiarised
a
portion

writings
which
gave
them
popularity
a
complete
library
of
one
of

must
have
contained
a
strange
mixture
of
works
embracing
in

books
of
devotion
which
were
indispensable

who
were
solicitous

the
of
an
egyptian
of

the
language

it

not

stiff

dry

would

us
an
idea

of
kings

princes

pharaohs

we
come
across
a
vague
and
undefined
pharaoh
who
figures
under
the
title
of
pîrûîâûi
or
prûîti
but
more
often
it
is
a
and
illustrious
pharaoh
who
is
mentioned
by
name
it
is
related
how
one
day
kheops
suffering
from
within
his
palace
assembled
his
sons
in
the
hope
of
learning
from
them
something
which
he
did
not
already
know
they
described
to
him
one
after
another
the
prodigies
performed
by
celebrated
magicians
under
kanibri
and
snofrûi
and
at
length
mykerinos
assured
him
that
there
was
a
certain
didi
living
then
not
far
from
meîdum
who
was
capable
of
repeating
all
the
marvels
done
by
former
wizards
most
of
the
egyptian
sovereigns
were
in
the
same
way
subjects
of
more
or
less
wonderful
legends
sesostris
amenôthes
thûfcmosis
amenemhâît
khîti
sahûrî
usirkaf
and
kakiû
these
stories
were
put
into
literary
shape
by
the
learned
recited
by
public
and
received
by
the
people
as
authentic
history
they
finally
filtered
into
the
writings
of
the
chroniclers
who
in
introducing
them
into
the
annals
filled
up
with
their
extraordinary
details
the
lacunæ
of
authentic
tradition
sometimes
the
narrative
assumed
a
briefer
form
and
became
an
apologue
in
one
of
them
the
members
of
the
body
were
supposed
to
have
combined
against
the

disputed
its
supremacy

all
pleaded
their
cause
in

version
of
the
of

also
had
their
place
in
this
universal
comedy
the

the
weaknesses
of
humanity
were
attributed
to
them

an
illustrator
in
granville
so
too
in
egypt
the
draughtsman
brought
his
reed
to
the
aid
of
the
fabulist
and
by
his
cleverly
executed
sketches
gave
greater
point
to
the
sarcasm
of
story
than
mere
words
could
have
conveyed
where
the
author
had
briefly
mentioned
that
the
jackal
and
the
cat
had
cunningly
forced
their
services
on
the
animals
whom
they
wished
to
devour
at
their
leisure
the
artist
would
depict
the
jackal
and
the
cat
equipped
as
peasants
with
wallets
on
their
backs
and
sticks
over
their
shoulders
marching
behind
a
troup
of
gazelles
or
a
flock
of
fat
geese
it
was
easy
to
foretell
the
fate
of
their
unfortunate
charges
elsewhere
it
is
an
ox
who
brings
up
before
his
master
a
cat
who
has
cheated
him
and
his
proverbial
stupidity
would
incline
us
to
think
that
he
will
end
by
being
punished

the
misdeeds
of
which

at

itself

not
escape
their
attacks

writers
of

day
made
fun
of
the

a
syrian
stronghold
illustration
a

this
treatment
of
ethics
did
not
prevent
the
egyptian
writers
from
giving
way
to
their
natural
inclinations
and
composing
large
volumes
on
this
subject
after
the
manner
of
kaqîmni
or
phtahhotpû
one
of
their
books
in
which
the
aged
ani
inscribes
his
instructions
to
his
son
khonshotpû
is
compiled
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
and
contains
the
usual
commonplaces
upon
virtue
temperance
piety
the
respect
due
to
parents
from
children
or
to
the
great
ones
of
this
world
from
their
inferiors
the
language
in
which
it
is
written
is
ingenious
picturesque
and
at
times
eloquent
the
work
explains
much
that
is
obscure
in
egyptian
life
and
upon
which
the
monuments
have
thrown
no
light
of
the
woman
who
goes
out
surreptitiously
in
her
town
do
not
follow
her
or
any
like
her
do
not
expose
thyself
to
the
experience
of
what
it
costs
a
man
to
face
an
ocean
of
which
the
bounds
are
unknown
the
wife
whose
husband
is
far
from
home
sends
thee
letters
and
invites
thee
to
come
to
her
daily
when
she
has
no
witnesses
if
she
succeeds
in
entangling
thee
in
her
net
it
is
a
crime
which
is
punishable
by
death
as
soon
as
it
is
known
even
if
no
wicked
act
has
taken
place
for
men
will
commit
every
sort
of
crime
when
under
this
temptation
i
have
been
obliged
to
paraphrase
the
sentence
considerably
to
render
it
intelligible
to
the
modern
reader
the
egyptian
text
says
briefly
not
know
the
man
who
braves
the
water
of
the
ocean
whose
bounds
are
know
the
means
here
the
state
of
the
who
does
an
action
not
quarrelsome
in
breweries
for
fear
that
thou
mayest
be
denounced
forthwith
for
words
which
have
proceeded
from
thy
mouth
and
of
having
spoken
that
of
which
thou
art
no
longer
conscious
thou
fallest
thy
members
helpless
and
no
one
holds
out
a
hand
to
thee
but
thy
around
thee
say
with
the
drunkard
thou
art
wanted
for
some
business
and
thou
art
found
rolling
on
the
ground
like
an
in
speaking
of
what
a
man
owes
to
his
mother
ani
waxes
eloquent
she
bore
thee
as
all
have
to
bear
she
had
in
thee
a
heavy
burden
without
being
able
to
call
on
thee
to
share
it
when
thou
wert
born
after
thy
months
were
fulfilled
she
placed
herself
under
a
yoke
in
earnest
her
breast
was
in
thy
mouth
for
three
years
in
spite
of
the
increasing
dirtiness
of
thy
habits
her
heart
felt
no
disgust
and
she
never
said
is
that
i
do
here
when
thou
didst
go
to
school
to
be
instructed
in
writing
she
followed
thee
every
day
with
bread
and
beer
from
thy
house
now
thou
art
a
man
thou
hast
taken
a
wife
thou
hast
provided
thyself
with
a
house
bear
always
in
mind
the
pains
of
thy
birth
and
the
care
for
thy
education
that
thy
mother
lavished
on
thee
that
her
anger
may
not
rise
up
against
thee
and
that
she
lift
not
her
hands
to
god
for
he
will
hear
her
complaint
the
whole
of
the
book
does
not
rise
to
this
level
but
we
find
in
it
several
maxims
which
appear
to
be
popular
proverbs
as
for
instance
who
hates
idleness
will
come
without
being
called
good
walker
comes
to
his
end
without
needing
to
hasten
or
ox
which
goes
at
the
head
of
the
flock
and
leads
the
others
to
pasture
is
but
an
animal
like
his
towards
the
end
the
son
khonshotpû
weary
of
such
a
lengthy
exhortation
to
wisdom
interrupts
his
father
roughly
not
everlastingly
speak
of
thy
merits
i
have
heard
enough
of
thy
deeds
whereupon
ani
resignedly
restrains
himself
from
further
speech
and
a
final
parable
gives
us
the
motive
of
his
resignation
is
the
likeness
of
the
man
who
knows
the
strength
of
his
arm
the
nursling
who
is
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
cares
only
for
being
suckled
but
no
sooner
has
he
found
his
mouth
than
he
cries
me
bread
it
is
perhaps
difficult
for
us
to
imagine
an
egyptian
in
love
repeating
madrigals
to
his
mistress
for
we
can
not
easily
realise
that
the
hard
and
blackened
bodies
we
see
in
our
museums
have
once
been
men
and
women
loving
and
beloved
in
their
own
day
the
remains
of
egyptian
amatory
literature
have
been
collected
translated
and
commentated
on
by
maspero
they
have
been
preserved
in
two
papyri
one
of
which
is
at
turin
the
other
in
the
british
museum
the
first
of
these
appears
to
be
a
sort
of
dialogue
in
which
the
trees
of
a
garden
boast
one
after
another
of
the
beauty
of
a
woman
and
discourse
of
the
which
took
place
under
their
shadow
the
feeling
which
they
entertained
one
for
another
had
none
of
the
reticence
or
delicacy
of
our
love
they
went
straight
to
the
point
and
the
language
in
which
they
expressed
themselves
is
sometimes
too
coarse
for
our
taste
the
manners
and
customs
of
daily
life
among
the
egyptians
tended
to
blunt
in
them
the
feelings
of
modesty
and
refinement
to
which
our
civilization
has
accustomed
us
their
children
went
about
without
clothes
or
at
any
rate
wore
none
until
the
age
of
puberty
owing
to
the
climate
both
men
and
women
left
the
upper
part
of
the
body
more
or
less
uncovered
or
wore
fabrics
of
a
transparent
nature
in
the
towns
the
servants
who
moved
about
their
masters
or
his
guests
had
merely
a
narrow
tied
round
their
hips
while
in
the
country
the
peasants
dispensed
with
even
this
covering
and
the
women
tucked
up
their
garments
when
at
work
so
as
to
move
more
freely
the
religious
teaching
and
the
ceremonies
connected
with
their
worship
drew
the
attention
of
the
faithful
to
the
unveiled
human
form
of
their
gods
and
the
hieroglyphs
themselves
contained
pictures
which
shock
our
sense
of
propriety
hence
it
came
about
that
the
young
girl
who
was
demanded
in
marriage
had
no
idea
like
the
maiden
of
of
the
vague
delights
of
an
ideal
union
the
physical
side
was
impressed
upon
her
mind
and
she
was
well
aware
of
the
full
meaning
of
her
consent
her
lover
separated
from
her
by
her
disapproving
parents
thus
expresses
the
grief
which
overwhelms
him
desire
to
lie
down
in
my
chamber
for
i
am
sick
on
thy
account
and
the
neighbours
come
to
visit
ah
if
my
sister
but
came
with
them
she
would
show
the
physicians
what
ailed
me
for
she
knows
my
sickness
even
while
he
thus
complains
he
sees
her
in
his
imagination
and
his
spirit
visits
the
places
she
frequents
villa
of
my
sister
a
pool
is
before
the
house
the
door
opens
suddenly
and
my
sister
passes
out
in
ah
why
am
i
not
the
porter
that
she
might
give
me
her
orders
i
should
at
least
hear
her
voice
even
were
she
angry
and
i
like
a
little
boy
full
of
fear
before
her
meantime
the
young
girl
sighs
in
vain
for
brother
the
beloved
of
her
heart
and
all
that
charmed
her
before
has
now
ceased
to
please
her
went
to
prepare
my
snare
my
cage
and
the
covert
for
my
trap
for
all
the
birds
of
puânît
alight
upon
egypt
redolent
with
perfume
he
who
flies
foremost
of
the
flock
is
attracted
by
my
worm
bringing
odours
from
puânît
its
claws
full
of
but
my
heart
is
with
thee
and
desires
that
we
should
trap
them
together
i
with
thee
alone
and
that
thou
shouldest
be
able
to
hear
the
sad
cry
of
my
perfumed
bird
there
near
to
me
close
to
me
i
will
make
ready
my
trap
o
my
beautiful
friend
thou
who
goest
to
the
field
of
the
the

however
is
slow
to
appear
the
day
passes
away
the
evening
comes
on
cry
of
the
goose
resounds
which
is
caught
by
the

thy
love
removes
me
far
from
the
bird
and
i
am
unable
to
deliver
myself
from
it
i
will
carry
off
my
net
and
what
shall
i
say
to
my
mother
when
i
shall
have
returned
to
her
every
day
i
come
back
laden
with
spoil
but
i
have
not

for

me
its
prisoner
goose
flies
away
alights
it
has
greeted
the
barns
with
its
cry
the
flock
of
birds
increases
on
the
river
but
i
leave
them
alone
and
think
only
of
thy
love
for
my
heart
is
bound
to
thy
heart
and
i
can
not
tear
myself
away
from
thy
her
mother
probably
gave
her
a
scolding
but
she
hardly
minds
it
and
in
the
retirement
of
her
chamber
never
wearies
of
thinking
of
her
brother
and
of
passionately
crying
for
him
my
beautiful
friend
i
yearn
to
be
with
thee
as
thy
wife
and
that
thou
shouldest
go
whither
thou
wishest
with
thine
arm
upon
my
arm
for
then
i
will
repeat
to
my
heart
which
is
in
thy
breast
my
if
my
great
brother
does
not
come
i
am
as
those
who
lie
in
the
tomb
for
thou
art
thou
not
health
and
life
he
who
transfers
the
joys
of
thy
health
to
my
heart
which
seeks
thee
the
hours
pass
away
and
he
does
not
come
and
already
voice
of
the
speaks
it
says
the
dawn
is
here
alas
what
is
to
become
of
me
thou
thou
art
the
bird
thou
callest
me
and
i
find
my
brother
in
his
chamber
and
my
heart
is
rejoiced
to
see
him
i
will
never
go
away
again
my
hand
will
remain
in
thy
hand
and
when
i
wander
forth
i
will
go
with
thee
into
the
most
beautiful
places
happy
in
that
he
makes
me
the
foremost
of
women
and
that
he
does
not
break
my
we
should
like
to
quote
the
whole
of
it
but
the
text
is
mutilated
and
we
are
unable
to
fill
in
the
blanks
it
is
nevertheless
one
of
those
products
of
the
egyptian
mind
which
it
would
have
been
easy
for
us
to
appreciate
from
beginning
to
end
without
effort
and
almost
without
explanation
the
passion
in
it
finds
expression
in
such
sincere
and
simple
language
as
to
render
rhetorical
ornament
needless
and
one
can
trace
in
it
therefore
nothing
of
the
artificial
colouring
which
would
limit
it
to
a
particular
place
or
time
it
translates
a
universal
sentiment
into
the
common
language
of
humanity
and
the
hieroglyphic
groups
need
only
to
be
put
into
the
corresponding
words
of
any
modern
tongue
to
bring
home
to
the
reader
their
full
force
and
intensity
we
might
compare
it
with
those
popular
songs
which
are
now
being
collected
in
our
provinces
before
the
peasantry
have
forgotten
them
altogether
the
artlessness
of
some
of
the
expressions
the
boldness
of
the
imagery
the
awkwardness
and
somewhat
abrupt
character
of
some
of
the
passages
communicate
to
both
that
wild
charm
which
we
miss
in
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
our
modern
end
