a
memoir
by
his
intellectual
living
is
not
so
much
an
accomplishment
as
a
state
or
condition
of
the
mind
in
which
it
seeks
earnestly
for
the
highest
and
purest
truth
if
we
often
blunder
and
fail
for
want
of
perfect
wisdom
and
clear
light
have
we
not
the
inward
assurance
that
our
aspiration
has
not
been
all
in
vain
that
it
has
brought
us
a
little
nearer
to
the
supreme
intellect
whose
effulgence
draws
us

intellectual
preface
about
twelve
years
ago
my
husband
told
me
that
he
had
begun
to
write
an
autobiography
intended
for
publication
but
not
during
his
lifetime
he
worked
upon
it
at
intervals
as
his
literary
engagements
permitted
but
i
found
after
his
sudden
death
that
he
had
only
been
able
to
carry
it
as
far
as
his
year
such
a
fragment
seemed
too
brief
for
separate
publication
and
i
earnestly
desired
to
supplement
it
by
a
memoir
and
thus
to
give
to
those
who
knew
and
loved
his
books
a
more
complete
understanding
of
his
character
and
career
but
though
i
longed
for
this
satisfaction
and
solace
the
task
seemed
beyond
my
power
especially
as
it
involved
the
difficulty
of
writing
in
a
foreign
language
considering
however
that
the
autobiography
was
carried
as
it
happened
up
to
the
date
of
our
marriage
and
that
i
could
therefore
relate
all
the
subsequent
life
from
intimate
knowledge
as
no
one
else
could
i
was
encouraged
by
many
of
hamerton
admirers
to
make
the
attempt
and
with
the
great
and
untiring
help
of
his
best
friend
seeley
i
have
been
enabled
to
complete
the
memoir
such
as
it
is
i
offer
my
sincere
thanks
to
sidney
colvin

his

my
reasons
for
writing
an
that
a
man
knows
the
history
of
his
own
life
better
than
a
biographer
can
know
frankness
and
the
contemplation
of
death
my
principal
reasons
for
writing
an
autobiography
are
because
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
knows
enough
about
my
history
to
give
a
truthful
account
of
it
and
because
i
dread
the
possibility
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
some
writer
who
might
attempt
a
biography
with
inadequate
materials
i
have
already
been
selected
as
a
subject
by
two
or
three
biographers
with
very
friendly
intentions
but
their
friendliness
did
not
always
ensure
accuracy
when
the
materials
are
not
supplied
in
abundance
a
writer
will
eke
them
out
with
conjectural
expressions
which
he
only
intends
as
an
amplification
yet
which
may
contain
germs
of
error
to
be
in
their
turn
amplified
by
some
other
writer
and
made
more
extensively
erroneous
it
has
frequently
been
said
that
an
autobiography
must
of
necessity
be
an
untrue
representation
of
its
subject
as
no
man
can
judge
himself
correctly
if
it
is
intended
to
imply
that
somebody
else
having
a
much
slighter
acquaintance
with
the
man
whose
life
is
to
be
narrated
would
produce
a
more
truthful
book
one
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
the
validity
of
the
inference
thousands
of
facts
are
known
to
a
man
himself
with
reference
to
his
career
and
a
multitude
of
determinant
motives
which
are
not
known
even
to
his
most
intimate
friends
still
less
to
the
stranger
who
so
often
undertakes
the
biography
the
reader
of
an
autobiography
has
this
additional
advantage
that
the
writer
must
be
unconsciously
revealing
himself
all
along
merely
by
his
way
of
telling
things
with
regard
to
the
great
question
of
frankness
and
reserve
i
hold
that
the
reader
has
a
fair
claim
to
hear
the
truth
as
a
biography
is
not
avowedly
a
romance
but
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
right
to
maintain
a
certain
reserve
my
rule
shall
be
to
say
nothing
that
can
hurt
the
living
and
the
memory
of
the
dead
shall
be
dealt
with
as
tenderly
as
may
be
compatible
with
a
truthful
account
of
the
influences
that
have
impelled
me
in
one
direction
or
another
i
have
all
the
more
kindly
feelings
towards
the
dead
that
when
these
pages
appear
i
shall
be
one
of
themselves
and
therefore
unable
to
defend
my
own
memory
as
they
are
unable
to
defend
theirs
the
notion
of
being
a
dead
man
is
not
entirely
displeasing
to
me
if
the
dead
are
defenceless
they
have
this
compensating
advantage
that
nobody
can
inflict
upon
them
any
sensible
injury
and
in
beginning
a
book
which
is
not
to
see
the
light
until
i
am
lying
comfortably
in
my
grave
with
six
feet
of
earth
above
me
to
deaden
the
noises
of
the
upper
world
i
feel
quite
a
new
kind
of
security
and
write
with
a
more
complete
freedom
from
anxiety
about
the
quality
of
the
work
than
has
been
usual
at
the
beginning
of
other
manuscripts
nevertheless
the
clear
and
steady
contemplation
of
death
i
have
been
looking
the
grim
king
in
the
face
for
the
last
hour
may
produce
a
paralyzing
effect
upon
a
man
by
making
his
life
work
seem
very
small
to
him
for
whatever
we
believe
about
a
future
state
it
is
evident
that
the
catastrophe
of
death
must
throw
each
of
us
instantaneously
into
the
past
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
living
and
they
will
see
what
we
have
done
in
a
very
foreshortened
aspect
so
that
except
in
a
few
very
rare
cases
it
must
look
small
to
them
and
ever
smaller
as
time
rolls
on
and
they
will
probably
not
think
much
of
it
or
remember
us
long
on
account
of
it
and
in
thinking
of
ourselves
as
dead
we
instinctively
adopt
the
survivor
point
of
view
besides
which
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
whatever
fate
may
be
in
store
for
us
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
posthumous
reputation
in
two
or
three
nations
on
this
planet
can
have
little
effect
on
our
future
satisfaction
for
if
we
go
to
heaven
the
beatitude
of
the
life
there
will
be
so
incomparably
superior

my
my
father
and
circumstances
of
their
their
short
married
birth
of
their
death
of
my
her
character
and
my
father
as
a
dulness
of
his
its
degradation
i
was
born
at
laneside
near
shaw
which
is
now
a
manufacturing
town
of
some
importance
about
two
miles
from
oldham
in
lancashire
and
about
four
miles
from
rochdale
in
the
same
county
laneside
is
a
small
estate
with
some
houses
and
a
little
upon
it
which
belonged
to
my
maternal
grandfather
the
house
is
of
stone
with
a
roof
of
stone
slate
such
as
is
usual
in
those
parts
and
it
faces
the
road
from
which
it
is
separated
by
a
little
enclosure
that
may
be
called
a
garden
if
you
will
when
i
was
a
child
there
were
two
or
three
poplar
trees
in
that
enclosure
before
the
house
but
trees
do
not
prosper
there
and
now
there
is
probably
not
one
on
the
whole
estate
one
end
of
the
house
which
is
rather
long
for
its
height
and
depth
abuts
against
the
hill
and
close
behind
it
is
the
which
my
grandfather
worked
with
no
great
profit
to
himself
or
advantage
to
his
descendants
i
have
mentioned
a
road
that
passes
the
house
it
is
steep
narrow
and
inconvenient
it
leads
up
to
an
elevated
tract
of
the
most
dreary
country
that
can
be
imagined
but
there
are
one
or
two
fields
on
the
laneside
estate
above
the
from
which
there
is
a
good
view
in
the
direction
of
rochdale
i
never
knew
my
grandfather
cocker
but
have
heard
that
he
was
a
lively
and
vigorous
man
who
enjoyed
life
very
heartily
in
his
way
he
married
a
miss
crompton
who
had
a
little
property
and
was
descended
from
the
de
cromptons
of
crompton
hall
i
am
not
aware
that
she
had
any
family
pride
but
like
most
people
in
that
neighborhood
she
had
a
great
appreciation
of
the
value
of
money
and
when
she
was
left
alone
with
her
daughter
in
consequence
of
philip
cocker
premature
death
she
was
more
inclined
to
favor
wealthy
than
impecunious
suitors
my
father
had
come
to
shaw
as
a
young
attorney
some
time
before
he
asked
for
anne
cocker
in
marriage
he
had
very
little
to
recommend
him
except
a
fine
person
great
physical
strength
and
fifteen
quarterings
he
had
a
reputation
for
rather
dissolute
habits
was
a
good
horseman
an
excellent
shot
looked
very
well
in
a
and
these
i
believe
were
all
his
advantages
save
an
unhappy
faculty
for
shining
in
such
masculine
company
as
he
could
find
in
a
lancashire
village
in
the
days
of
george
iv
money
he
had
none
except
what
he
earned
in
his
profession
at
one
time
rather
a
good
income
miss
anne
cocker
was
a
young
lady
with
a
will
of
her
own
associated
i
have
been
told
the
two
characteristics
are
by
no
means
incompatible
with
a
very
sweet
and
amiable
disposition
at
a
time
when
my
grandmother
still
vigorously
opposed
the
match
with
my
father
there
happened
to
be
a
public
charity
ball
in
shaw
and
miss
cocker
showed
her
intentions
in
a
very
decided
manner
by
declining
to
dance
with
several
gentlemen
until
the
young
lawyer
presented
himself
when
she
rose
immediately
with
a
very
gracious
smile
which
was
observed
by
all
near
enough
to
witness
it
this
was
rather
unkind
perhaps
to
the
other
aspirants
and
is
in
fact
scarcely
defensible
but
it
was
miss
cocker
way
of
declaring
her
intentions
publicly
when
my
father
made
his
offer
he
was
refused
by
my
grandmother
orders
but
received
encouragement
from
her
daughter
a
tone
of
voice
or
a
look
yet
more
a
tear
would
be
enough
for
a
hope
and
counted
upon
the
effects
of
perseverance
at
length
when
he
and
miss
cocker
thought
they
had
waited
long
enough
they
determined
to
marry
without
cocker
consent
and
the
determination
was
notified
to
my
grandmother
in
the
following
very
decided
terms
madam
you
are
no
doubt
well
aware
of
the
warm
attachment
which
has
long
existed
betwixt
your
dear
daughter
and
myself
upwards
of
twelve
months
ago
our
affections
were
immovably
fixed
upon
each
other
and
i
now
consider
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
we
are
fully
engaged
and
have
finally
concluded
to
be
married
within
a
fortnight
of
the
present
time
i
sincerely
trust
that
all
your
hostile
feelings
towards
me
are
entirely
worn
out
and
that
you
will
receive
me
as
the
affectionate
husband
of
your
beloved
daughter
and
i
with
great
confidence
hope
we
shall
be
a
happy
family
and
live
together
with
peace
and
harmony
at
my
request
your
daughter
will
have
all
her
property
settled
upon
herself
so
that
i
can
have
no
control
over
it
thus
leaving
it
impossible
that
i
should
waste
it
and
i
trust
that
by
an
active
attention
to
my
profession
i
may
be
enabled
not
inconsiderably
to
augment
it
be
assured
dear
madam
that
your
daughter
and
myself
feel
no
little
solicitude
for
your
comfort
and
happiness
and
that
we
shall
at
all
times
be
most
happy
to
promote
them
it
is
our
mutual
and
most
anxious
wish
that
you
should
not
attempt
to
throw
any
obstacle
in
the
way
of
our
marriage
as
the
only
tendency
it
could
have
under
present
circumstances
would
be
to
lessen
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
our
union
we
trust
therefore
that
your
regard
for
your
daughter
happiness
will
induce
you
at
once
to
give
your
full
assent
to
the
fulfilment
of
our
engagement
as
you
would
thereby
divest
our
marriage
of
all
that
could
possibly
lessen
the
happiness
we
anticipate
from
it
i
know
that
your
principal
objection
to
me
has
been
on
account
of
my
unsteadiness
and
i
deeply
regret
ever
having
given
you
cause
to
raise
such
an
objection
but
i
trust
my
conduct
for
some
time
back
having
been
of
a
very
different
character
will
convince
you
that
i
have
seen
my
error
the
gayety
into
which
i
have
fallen
may
partly
be
ascribed
to
the
peculiarity
of
my
situation
having
no
relations
near
me
no
family
ties
no
domestic
comforts
i
may
be
the
more
excusable
for
having
kept
the
company
of
young
men
but
i
can
assure
you
i
have
lost
all
inclination
for
the
practice
of
such
follies
as
i
have
once
fallen
into
and
i
look
to
a
steady
sober
married
life
as
alone
calculated
to
afford
me
happiness
i
will
wait
upon
you
on
monday
with
most
anxious
hopes
for
your
favorable
answer
i
am
dear
madam
yours
most
respectfully
john
hammerton
shaw
june
the
reader
may
be
surprised
by
the
double
in
the
signature
it
was
my
father
custom
to
write
our
name
so
for
a
reason
that
will
be
explained
in
another
chapter
the
letter
itself
is
rather
formal
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
letter
in
its
way
and
believe
it
to
have
been
perfectly
sincere
no
doubt
my
father
fully
intended
to
reform
his
way
of
life
but
it
is
easier
to
make
a
good
resolution
than
to
adhere
to
it
i
do
not
know
enough
of
the
degree
of
excess
to
which
his
love
of
pleasure
led
him
to
be
able
to
describe
his
life
as
a
young
man
accurately
but
as
my
mother
had
been
well
brought
up
and
was
a
refined
person
for
her
rank
in
society
i
conclude
that
she
would
not
have
encouraged
a
notorious
those
who
knew
my
father
in
his
early
manhood
have
told
me
that
he
was
very
popular
and
yet
at
the
same
time
that
he
bore
himself
with
considerable
dignity
one
old
lady
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
when
he
walked
through
the
main
street
at
shaw
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
town
belonged
to
him
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
understand
quite
accurately
the
social
code
of
the
georgian
era
when
a
man
might
indulge
in
pleasures
which
seem
to
us
coarse
and
degrading
and
yet
retain
all
the
pride
and
all
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
the
marriage
took
place
according
to
the
fixed
resolution
of
the
contracting
parties
and
their
life
together
was
immensely
happy
during
the
short
time
that
it
lasted
most
unfortunately
it
came
to
an
end
after
little
more
than
one
year
by
my
mother
lamentably
premature
death
i
happen
to
possess
a
letter
from
my
father
sister
to
her
sister
anne
in
which
she
gives
an
account
of
this
event
and
print
it
because
it
conveys
the
reality
more
vividly
than
a
narrative
at
second
hand
the
reader
will
pardon
the
reference
to
myself
it
matters
nothing
to
a
dead
man
as
i
shall
be
when
this
page
is
printed
whether
at
the
age
of
fourteen
days
he
was
considered
a
child
or
a
weakling
my
dear
anne
you
will
not
calculate
upon
so
speedy
an
answer
as
this
to
your
long
and
welcome
epistle
nor
will
you
calculate
upon
the
melancholy
intelligence
i
have
to
communicate
poor
john
wife
certainly
the
most
amiable
of
all
departed
this
life
at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
last
night
her
recovery
from
her
confinement
was
very
wonderful
we
thought
but
alas
it
was
a
false
one
the
drs
whitaker
of
shaw
wood
of
rochdale
and
bardsley
of
manchester
all
agree
in
opinion
that
she
has
died
of
mere
weakness
without
any
absolute
disease
she
has
been
very
delicate
for
a
long
time
poor
dear
john
if
i
were
quite
indifferent
to
him
i
should
grieve
to
see
his
agonies
he
says
at
sixty
it
might
have
happened
in
the
common
course
of
things
and
he
would
have
borne
it
better
but
at
just
when
he
is
beginning
life
his
sad
bereavement
does
indeed
seem
untimely
it
is
a
sore
affliction
to
him
sent
for
some
good
and
may
he
understand
and
apply
it
with
wisdom
they
had
to
be
sure
hardly
been
married
long
enough
to
quarrel
but
i
never
saw
a
couple
so
intent
on
making
each
other
happy
they
had
not
a
thought
of
each
other
but
what
tended
to
please
the
poor
little
boy
is
a
very
fine
one
and
i
hope
he
will
be
reared
though
it
often
happens
that
when
the
mother
is
consumptive
the
baby
dies
i
do
hope
when
john
is
able
to
look
after
his
office
a
little
that
the
occupation
of
his
mind
will
give
him
calm
he
walks
from
room
to
room
and
if
i
meet
him
and
he
is
able
to
articulate
at
all
he
says
where
must
i
be
what
must
i
do
he
says
nobody
had
such
a
wife
and
i
do
think
nobody
ever
had
he
wanted
me
not
to
write
till
arrangements
were
made
about
the
funeral
i
thought
you
would
be
sorry
to
be
informed
late
upon
a
subject
so
near
john
heart
and
that
it
was
too
late
for
hinde
footnote
the
rev
thomas
hinde
vicar
of
featherstone
of
the
writer
of
the
letter
to
come
to
the
funeral
i
have
really
nothing
to
say
except
that
our
poor
sister
was
so
tolerable
on
wednesday
morning
that
i
went
with
the
milnes
of
park
house
to
henton

which
i
liked
very
well

as
things
have
turned
out

heartily
repent
going

hoped
positively
recovering
on
monday
and
tuesday
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
lightening
before
death
she
was
a
very
long
time
in
the
agonies
of
death
but
seemed
to
suffer
very
little

compliments
to

m
hammerton
the
letter
is
without
date
but
it
bears
the
manchester
postmark
of
september
and
the
day
of
my
birth
was
the
tenth
of
the
same
month
the
reader
may
have
observed
a
discrepancy
with
reference
to
my
mother
health
first
it
is
said
that
the
doctors
all
agreed
in
the
opinion
that
she
died
of
mere
weakness
without
any
absolute
disease
but
afterwards
consumption
is
alluded
to
i
am
not
sure
even
yet
whether
my
mother
was
really
consumptive
or
only
suffered
from
debility
down
to
the
time
when
i
write
this
years
after
my
death
there
have
never
been
any
symptoms
of
consumption
in
me
no
portrait
of
my
mother
was
ever
taken
so
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
picture
her
to
myself
otherwise
than
vaguely
but
i
remember
that
on
one
occasion
in
my
youth
when
i
played
the
part
of
a
young
lady
in
a
charade
several
persons
present
who
had
known
her
said
that
the
likeness
was
so
striking
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
had
appeared
to
them
in
a
vision
and
they
told
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
know
what
my
mother
was
like
i
had
only
to
consult
a
she
had
blue
eyes
a
very
fair
complexion
and
hair
of
a
rich
auburn
a
color
more
appreciated
by
painters
than
by
other
people
in
the
year
i
was
examining
a
large
boxful
of
business
papers
that
had
belonged
to
my
father
and
burning
most
of
them
in
a
garden
in
yorkshire
when
a
little
packet
fell
out
of
a
legal
document
that
i
was
just
going
to
throw
upon
the
fire
it
was
a
lock
of
hair
carefully
folded
in
a
piece
of
the
bluish
paper
my
father
used
for
his
law
correspondence
and
fastened
with
an
old
pin
i
at
once
took
it
to
a
lady
who
had
known
my
mother
and
she
said
without
a
hesitation
that
the
hair
was
certainly
hers
so
that
i
now
possess
this
relic
and
it
is
all
i
have
of
my
poor
mother
whose
face
i
never
saw
and
whose
voice
i
never
heard
few
people
who
have
lived
in
the
world
have
left
such
slight
traces
there
are
no
letters
of
hers
except
one
or
two
formal
compositions
written
at
school
under
the
eye
of
the
mistress
which
of
course
express
nothing
of
her
own
mind
or
feelings
those
who
knew
her
have
told
me
that
she
was
a
very
lively
and
amiable
person
physically
active
and
a
good
horsewoman
she
and
my
father
were
fond
of
riding
out
together
and
indeed
were
separated
as
little
as
might
be
during
their
brief
happiness
she
even
on
one
occasion
went
out
shooting
with
him
and
killed
something
after
which
she
melted
into
tears
of
pity
over
her
victim
footnote
a
lady
related
to
my
mother
shot
well
and
killed
various
kinds
of
game
of
which
i
remember
seeing
stuffed
specimens
as
trophies
of
her
skill
the
reader
will
pardon
me
for
dwelling
thus
on
these
few
details
of
a
life
so
sadly
and
prematurely
ended
the
knowledge
that
my
mother
had
died
early
cast
a
certain
melancholy
over
my
childhood
i
found
that
people
looked
at
me
with
some
tenderness
and
pity
for
her
sake
so
i
felt
vaguely
that
there
had
been
a
great
loss
though
unable
to
estimate
the
extent
of
it
later
when
i
understood
better
what
pains
and
perils
nature
inflicts
on
women
in
order
that
children
may
come
into
the
world
it
seemed
that
the
days
i
lived
had
been
bought
for
me
by
the
sacrifice
of
days
that
my
mother
ought
to
have
lived
she
was
but
when
she
passed
away
so
that
now
i
have
lived
more
than
twice
her
span
the
effect
of
the
loss
upon
my
father
was
utterly
disastrous
his
new
and
good
projects
were
all
shattered
and
a
cloud
fell
over
his
existence
that
was
never
lifted
he
did
not
marry
again
and
he
lost
his
interest
in
his
profession
my
mother
left
him
all
her
property
absolutely
so
he
felt
no
spur
of
necessity
and
became
indolent
or
indifferent
yet
those
who
were
capable
of
judging
had
a
good
opinion
of
his
abilities
as
a
lawyer
just
before
his
wife
death
my
father
had
rather
distinguished
himself
in
an
important
case
and
received
a
testimonial
from
his
client
with
the
following
inscription
to
hammerton
solr
by
his
obliged
client
waring
as
a
token
of
esteem
for
his
active
services
in
the
cause
tried
against
stopherd
at
lancaster
in
the
arrangement
of
the
argument
arising
thereon
at
westminster
and
his
successful
defence
to
the
equity
suit
instituted
by
the
my
father
practice
at
that
time
was
beginning
to
be
lucrative
and
would
no
doubt
have
become
much
more
so
in
a
few
years
but
the
blow
to
his
happiness
that
occurred
in
the
september
of
produced
such
discouragement
that
he
sought
relief
from
his
depression
in
the
society
of
lively
companions
most
unfortunately
for
him
there
was
no
lively
masculine
society
in
the
place
where
he
lived
that
was
not
at
the
same
time
a
constant
incitement
to
drinking
there
were
a
few
places
in
the
lancashire
of
those
days
where
convivial
habits
were
carried
to
such
a
degree
that
they
destroyed
what
ought
to
have
been
the
flower
of
the
male
population
the
strong
and
hearty
men
who
believed
that
they
could
be
imprudent
with
impunity
the
lively
intelligent
and
sociable
men
who
wanted
the
wittiest
and
brightest
talk
that
was
to
be
had
in
the
neighborhood
the
bachelor
whose
hearth
was
lonely
and
the
widower
whose
house
had
been
made
desolate
all
these
were
tempted
to
join
meetings
of
merry
companions
who
set
no
limits
to
the
strength
or
the
quantity
of
their
potations
my
poor
father
was
a
man
of
great
physical
endowments
and
he
came
at
last
to
have
a
mistaken
pride
in
being
able
to
drink
deeply
without
betraying
any
evil
effects
but
a
few
years
of
such
an
existence
undermined
one
of
the
finest
constitutions
ever
given
to
mortal
man
a
quarryman
once
told
me
that
my
father
had
appeared
at
the
quarry
at
six
in
the
morning
looking
quite
fresh
and
hearty
when
taking
up
the
heaviest
he
could
find
he
gayly
challenged
the
men
to
try
who
could
throw
it
farthest
none
of
them
came
near
him
on
which
he
turned
and
said
with
a
laugh
of
satisfaction
not
bad
that
for
a
man
who
drank
thirty
glasses
of
brandy
the
day
before
whether
he
had
ever
approached
such
a
formidable
number
i
will
not
venture
to
say
but
the
incident
exactly
paints
my
father
in
his
northern
pride
of
strength
the
fatal
pride
that
believes
itself
able
to
resist
poison
because
it
has
the
muscles
of
an
athlete
it
was
always
said
by
those
who
knew
the
family
that
my
father
was
the
cleverest
member
of
it
but
his
ability
must
have
expended
itself
in
witty
conversation
and
in
his
professional
work
as
i
do
not
remember
the
smallest
evidence
of
what
are
called
intellectual
tastes
my
mother
had
a
few
books
that
had
belonged
to
her
family
and
to
these
my
father
added
scarcely
anything
i
can
remember
his
books
quite
clearly
even
at
this
distance
of
time
one
was
a
biography
of
william
another
a
set
of
sketches
of
reform
ministers
a
third
was
baines
history
of
lancashire
a
fourth
a
geographical
dictionary
these
were
i
believe
almost
all
the
books
not
concerned
with
the
legal
profession
that
my
father
ever
purchased
his
bookcase
did
not
contain
a
single
volume
by
the
most
popular
english
poets
of
his
own
time
nor
even
so
much
as
a
novel
by
sir
walter
scott
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
having
seen
him
read
a
book
but
he
took
in
the
times
newspaper
and
i
clearly
remember
that
he
read
the
leading
articles
which
it
was
the
fashion
at
that
time
to
look
upon
as
models
of
style
this
absence
of
interest
in
literature
was
accompanied
by
that
complete
and
absolute
indifference
to
the
fine
arts
which
was
so
common
in
the
middle
classes
and
the
country
aristocracy
of
those
days
i
mention
these
deficiencies
to
explain
the
extreme
dulness
of
my
poor
father
existence
during
his
widowhood
a
dulness
that
a
lover
of
books
must
have
a
difficulty
in
imagining
a
man
living
alone
with
servants
for
his
son
childhood
was
spent
elsewhere
who
took
hardly
any
interest
in
a
profession
that
had
become
little
more
than
nominal
for
him
who
had
not
even
the
stimulus
of
a
desire
to
accumulate
wealth
almost
the
only
recognized
object
in
the
place
where
he
lived
a
man
who
had
no
intellectual
pursuits
whatever
and
whose
youth
was
too
far
behind
him
for
any
joyous
physical
activity
was
condemned
to
seek
such
amusements
as
the
customs
of
the
place
afforded
and
these
all
led
to
drinking
he
and
his
friends
drank
when
they
were
together
to
make
society
merrier
and
when
they
happened
to
be
alone
they
drank
to
make
solitude
endurable
had
they
drunk
light
wines
like
french
peasants
or
beer
like
germans
they
might
have
lasted
longer
but
their
favorite
drink
was
brandy
in
hot
strong
grogs
accompanied
by
unlimited
tobacco
they
dined
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
had
the
spirit
decanters
and
the
on
the
table
instead
of
dessert
frequently
drinking
through
the
whole
afternoon
and
a
long
evening
afterwards
in
the
morning
they
slaked
alcoholic
thirst
with
copious
draughts
of
ale
my
father
went
on
steadily
with
this
kind
of
existence
without
anything
whatever
to
rescue
him
from
its
gradual
and
fatal
degradation
he
separated
himself
entirely
from
the
class
he
belonged
to
by
birth
lived
with
men
of
little
culture
though
they
may
have
had
natural
wit
and
sacrificed
his
whole
future
to
mere
village
conviviality
thousands
of
others
have
followed
the
same
road
but
few
have
sacrificed
so
much
my
father
had
a
constitution
such
as
is
not
given
to
one
man
in
ten
thousand
and
his
mind
was
strong
and
clear
though
he
had
not
literary
tastes
he
was
completely
independent
free
to
travel
or
to
make
a
fortune
in
his
profession
if
he
preferred
a
sedentary
existence
but
the
binding
force
of
habit
overcame
his
weakened
will
and
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
life
that
placed
intellectual
and
moral
recovery
alike
beyond
his
reach
chapter
iii
my
childhood
is
passed
at
burnley
with
my
my
grandfather
and
estrangement
between
gilbert
hamerton
and
his
brother
of
hellifield
death
of
gilbert
his
taste
for
the
french
his
travels
in
portugal
and
the
conduct
of
a
steward
during
his
his
three
aristocratic
tendencies
of
his
beginning
of
my
visits
to
my
father
i
was
not
brought
up
during
childhood
under
my
father
roof
but
was
sent
to
live
with
his
two
unmarried
sisters
these
ladies
were
then
living
in
burnley
with
their
mother
burnley
is
now
a
large
manufacturing
town
of
seventy
thousand
inhabitants
but
in
those
days
it
was
just
rising
in
importance
and
a
few
years
earlier
it
had
been
a
small
country
town
in
an
uncommonly
aristocratic
neighborhood
the
gate
of
towneley
park
opens
now
almost
upon
the
town
itself
and
in
former
times
there
were
many
other
seats
of
the
greater
or
lesser
squires
within
a
radius
of
a
very
few
miles
it
is
a
common
mistake
in
the
south
of
england
to
suppose
that
lancashire
is
a
purely
commercial
county
there
are
or
were
in
my
youth
some
very
aristocratic
neighborhoods
in
lancashire
and
that
immediately
about
burnley
was
one
of
them
the
creation
of
new
wealth
and
the
extinction
or
departure
of
a
few
families
may
have
altered
its
character
since
then
but
in
the
days
of
my
grandfather
nobody
thought
of
disputing
the
supremacy
of
the
old
houses
there
was
something
almost
sublime
in
the
misty
antiquity
of
the
towneley
family
one
of
the
oldest
in
all
england
and
still
one
of
the
wealthiest
keeping
house
in
its
venerable
castellated
mansion
in
a
great
park
with
magnificent
avenues
other
houses
of
less
wealth
and
more
modern
date
had
their
pedigrees
in
the
history
of
lancashire
my
grandfather
gilbert
hamerton
possessed
an
old
gabled
mansion
with
a
small
but
picturesque
estate
divided
from
towneley
park
by
a
public
road
and
he
had
other
property
in
the
town
and
elsewhere
enough
to
make
him
independent
but
not
enough
to
make
him
one
of
the
great
squires
however
as
he
was
the
second
son
of
an
ancient
yorkshire
family
and
as
pedigrees
and
quarterings
counted
for
something
in
those
comparatively
romantic
times
the
somewhat
exclusive
aristocracy
about
burnley
had
received
him
with
much
cordiality
from
the
first
and
he
continued
all
his
life
to
belong
to
it
his
comparative
poverty
was
excused
by
a
history
of
confiscation
in
his
family
and
perhaps
made
him
rather
more
interesting
especially
as
it
did
not
go
far
enough
to
become
what
poverty
becomes
so
easily
ridiculous
he
lived
in
a
large
old
house
and
plentifully
enough
but
without
state
and
style
his
marriage
had
been
extremely
imprudent
from
the
worldly
point
of
view
an
aunt
of
my
grandfather
on
his
mother
side
had
invited
him
to
stay
with
her
and
had
not
foreseen
the
attractions
of
a
farmer
daughter
who
was
living
in
the
house
as
a
companion
my
good
unworldly
grandfather
fell
in
love
with
this
girl
and
married
her
he
never
had
any
serious
reason
to
regret
this
very
imprudent
step
for
jane
smith
became
an
excellent
wife
and
mother
and
she
did
not
even
injure
his
position
in
society
where
she
knew
how
to
make
herself
respected
and
was
much
beloved
by
her
most
intimate
friends
i
remember
her
though
i
never
knew
my
grandfather
my
recollection
of
her
is
a
sort
of
picture
of
an
old
lady
always
dressed
in
black
and
seated
near
a
window
or
walking
slowly
with
a
stick
the
dawn
of
reason
and
feeling
is
associated
in
my
memory
with
an
intense
affection
for
this
old
lady
and
with
the
kind
things
she
said
to
me
not
yet
forgotten
i
remember
too
the
awful
stillness
of
her
dead
body
hers
was
the
first
dead
human
body
i
looked
upon
and
the
strange
emptiness
of
the
house
when
it
had
been
taken
away
though
my
grandmother
was
only
a
farmer
daughter
her
parents
were
in
their
own
line
of
life
and
at
various
times
helped
my
grandfather
with
sums
of
money
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
had
married
quite
out
of
his
class
and
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
probable
that
the
marriage
may
have
had
some
connection
with
the
complete
and
permanent
estrangement
that
existed
between
gilbert
hamerton
and
his
brother
the
squire
of
hellifield
peel
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
to
understand
a
little
about
relationships
i
reflected
that
the
houses
of
my
own
uncles
were
open
to
me
that
my
cousins
were
all
like
brothers
and
sisters
to
me
and
yet
that
my
father
and
my
aunts
had
never
been
to
their
uncle
house
at
hellifield
and
that
our
relations
there
never
came
to
see
us
at
burnley
the
explanation
of
this
estrangement
given
by
my
grandfather
was
that
there
had
been
a
disagreement
about
land
but
perhaps
he
may
have
felt
some
delicacy
about
telling
his
children
that
his
unambitious
marriage
had
contributed
to
render
the
separation
permanent
however
this
may
have
been
my
grandmother
never
once
saw
the
inside
of
her
house
and
when
she
died
there
was
i
believe
not
even
the
formal
expression
of
condolence
that
is
usual
among
acquaintances
gilbert
hamerton
had
lived
at
hollins
a
house
and
estate
inherited
from
his
mother
and
james
hamerton
the
elder
brother
lived
in
a
castellated
peel
or
border
tower
at
hellifield
which
had
been
built
by
lawrence
hamerton
in
the
two
places
are
not
much
more
than
twenty
miles
apart
but
the
brothers
never
met
after
their
quarrel
and
my
grandfather
sons
and
daughters
never
saw
their
house
one
result
of
the
estrangement
was
that
we
hardly
seemed
to
belong
to
our
own
family
and
i
remember
a
lady
who
had
some
very
vague
and
shadowy
claims
to
a
distant
connection
with
the
family
at
hellifield
asking
one
of
my
aunts
in
a
rather
patronizing
manner
if
she
also
did
not
claim
to
be
connected
with
the
hamertons
of
hellifield
peel
even
to
this
day
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
realize
the
simple
fact
that
she
was
niece
to
an
uncle
whom
she
had
never
seen
and
first
cousin
to
his
successor
my
grandfather
had
lived
in
apparently
excellent
health
till
the
age
of
when
one
afternoon
as
he
was
seated
in
his
at
hollins
nobody
being
present
except
his
eldest
daughter
mary
he
asked
her
to
open
the
window
and
then
added
say
a
prayer
she
immediately
began
to
repeat
a
short
prayer
and
before
she
had
reached
the
end
of
it
he
was
dead
there
is
a
strange
incident
connected
with
his
death
which
may
be
worth
something
to
those
who
take
an
interest
in
what
is
now
called
psychical
research
at
the
same
hour
his
married
daughter
was
sitting
in
a
room
forty
miles
away
with
her
little
boy
a
child
just
old
enough
to
talk
and
the
child
stared
with
intense
interest
at
an
empty
chair
his
mother
asked
what
attracted
his
attention
and
the
child
said
do
you
see
mamma
the
old
gentleman
who
is
sitting
in
that
chair
i
am
careful
not
to
add
details
as
my
own
imagination
might
unconsciously
amplify
them
but
my
impression
is
that
the
child
was
asked
to
describe
the
vision
more
minutely
and
that
his
description
exactly
accorded
with
his
grandfather
usual
appearance
the
old
gentleman
preserved
the
costume
and
manners
of
the
eighteenth
century
wearing
his
breeches
and
he
took
life
too
easily
for
any
intellectual
achievements
but
he
had
a
great
liking
for
the
french
language
and
wrote
a
very
original
french
grammar
which
he
had
curiously
printed
in
synoptic
sheets
at
his
private
expense
though
it
was
never
completed
or
published
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
possible
that
my
own
aptitude
and
affinity
for
that
language
may
have
been
inherited
from
him
and
that
his
labors
may
in
a
manner
have
overcome
many
difficulties
for
me
by
the
wonderful
process
of
transmission
he
never
lived
in
france
and
i
believe
he
never
visited
the
country
his
french
conversations
being
chiefly
held
with
a
roman
catholic
chaplain
at
towneley
hall
my
most
extensive
travels
were
in
portugal
lasting
six
months
and
with
regard
to
that
journey
i
remember
two
painful
incidents
his
travelling
companion
a
younger
brother
died
abroad
in
consequence
of
having
slept
in
a
damp
bed
the
other
incident
is
vexatious
rather
than
tragical
and
yet
wordsworth
would
have
seen
tragedy
in
it
also
during
his
absence
from
home
my
grandfather
had
confided
the
care
of
his
estate
to
an
agent
who
cut
down
the
old
avenue
of
oaks
that
led
to
the
house
on
the
pretext
that
some
of
the
trees
were
showing
signs
of
decay
and
that
he
had
an
acceptable
offer
for
the
whole
the
road
retained
the
name
of
the
avenue
for
many
years
but
the
trees
were
never
replaced
perhaps
the
reader
will
think
this
incident
hardly
worth
mentioning
but
to
a
lover
of
trees
avenues
and
old
houses
such
as
i
confess
myself
to
be
it
seems
the
very
perfection
of
a
vexatious
incident
i
can
not
imagine
anything
whatever
not
entailing
any
serious
consequences
that
would
have
tried
my
own
temper
more
on
my
grandfather
death
the
whole
of
his
property
went
to
his
eldest
son
he
had
brought
up
all
his
three
sons
to
be
solicitors
not
because
he
had
any
peculiar
enthusiasm
for
the
legal
profession
but
simply
as
the
readiest
means
of
earning
a
living
the
sons
themselves
had
no
natural
affinity
for
the
law
my
eldest
uncle
heartily
disliked
it
the
other
regarded
it
with
cool
indifference
and
my
father
expressed
his
desire
that
i
should
never
be
a
lawyer
on
the
ground
that
a
man
had
enough
to
plague
him
in
his
own
concerns
without
troubling
his
mind
about
those
of
other
people
one
curious
distinction
may
be
noted
here
as
the
result
probably
of
that
intermingling
with
the
world
which
happens
naturally
in
the
career
of
provincial
attorneys
whilst
my
aunts
remained
all
their
lives
aristocratic
in
their
feelings
and
rather
liked
to
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
the
great
houses
in
the
neighborhood
my
uncles
and
my
father
also
abandoned
all
aristocratic
memories
and
aspirations
and
entered
frankly
into
the
middle
class
each
of
them
did
what
was
natural
under
the
circumstances
women
are
generally
more
aristocratic
than
men
and
cling
more
decidedly
to
their
class
and
i
think
my
aunts
showed
better
taste
in
liking
refined
society
than
my
father
did
in
lowering
himself
to
associate
with
men
of
an
inferior
stamp
in
rank
in
manners
and
in
habits
i
distinctly
remember
how
one
of
my
aunts
told
me
that
somebody
had
made
a
remark
on
her
liking
for
great
people
and
the
only
comment
she
made
was
that
she
preferred
gentlefolks
because
their
manners
were
more
agreeable
she
was
not
a
worshipper
of
rank
but
she
liked
the
quiet
pleasant
manners
of
the
aristocracy
which
indeed
were
simply
her
own
manners
my
childhood
could
not
have
been
better
cared
for
even
by
my
own
mother
than
by
these
two
excellent
ladies
they
gave
me
a
beginning
of
education
and
they
have
told
me
since
that
i
learned
to
read
english
with
the
greatest
facility
so
that
when
i
was
sent
to
the
grammar
school
at
burnley
at
the
early
age
of
five
and
a
half
the
master
considered
me
so
well
forward
that
i
was
set
at
once
to
latin
in
those
days
it
was
a
part
of
the
wisdom
of
our
educators
to
make
us
learn
latin
out
of
a
grammar
written
in
that
language
and
i
retain
some
recollection
of
the
perfectly
useless
mental
fatigue
and
puzzlement
that
i
was
made
to
undergo
in
learning
abstract
statements
about
grammatical
science
that
were
written
in
a
tongue
which
i
could
not
possibly
understand
the
idea
of
taking
a
child
five
and
a
half
years
old
and
making
it
learn
a
dead
language
by
abstract
rules
is
of
itself
a
great
error
the
proper
way
to
teach
a
child
latin
is
simply
to
give
it
a
vocabulary
including
only
the
things
that
it
can
see
or
imagine
and
a
few
verbs
to
make
little
phrases
i
had
learned
to
read
english
so
easily
that
good
hopes
were
entertained
for
the
rest
of
my
education
but
my
progress
in
latin
was
very
slow
and
the
only
result
of
my
early
training
was
to
give
me
a
horror
of
everything
printed
in
latin
that
i
did
not
overcome
for
many
years
there
was
another
rather
older
than
i
and
the
of
those
days
butler
predecessor
who
had
a
rude
disposition
sometimes
amused
himself
by
putting
me
on
one
of
his
knees
and
the
other
little
boy
on
the
other
knee
after
which
by
an
adroit
simultaneous
movement
of
the
two
legs
he
suddenly
brought
our
heads
into
collision
i
quite
remember
the
sensation
of
being
stunned
on
these
occasions
but
am
not
aware
that
my
latin
was
any
the
better
for
it
my
recollection
of
those
early
years
is
extremely
vague
and
there
is
little
in
them
that
could
interest
the
reader
i
was
taken
once
or
twice
a
year
to
my
father
and
always
disliked
and
dreaded
those
visits
as
i
feared
him
greatly
and
with
good
reason
on
one
of
these
visits
when
quite
a
child
i
persuaded
my
father
groom
to
let
me
mount
his
which
i
remember
as
a
gray
animal
of
what
seemed
a
prodigious
altitude
the
man
put
me
on
the
horse
back
and
being
entirely
destitute
of
or
prudence
actually
gave
me
a
whip
and
left
the
bridle
to
me
i
applied
the
whip
vigorously
and
was
very
soon
thrown
off
and
carried
back
to
the
house
covered
with
blood
happily
without
more
serious
consequences
another
little
incident
has
more
of
the
comic
element
my
father
employed
a
tailor
for
himself
and
told
the
man
to
make
me
a
suit
without
entering
into
any
particulars
the
tailor
being
thus
left
to
his
own
wisdom
made
a
costume
that
was
the
exact
copy
of
a
squire
dress
on
a
small
scale
it
was
composed
of
a
green
coat
a
yellow
waistcoat
and
green
trousers
the
whole
adorned
with
gilt
buttons
the
tailor
dressed
me
and
then
proud
of
his
work
presented
me
to
my
father
and
the
ladies
if
the
tailor
was
proud
my
pride
and
satisfaction
were
at
least
equal
to
his
and
we
neither
of
us
could
in
the
least
understand
the
roars
of
laughter
that
my
appearance
provoked
whilst
our
feelings
were
deeply
wounded
by
my
father
tyrannical
decree
that
i
was
never
to
wear
those
beautiful
clothes
at
all
even
to
this
day
i
am
capable
of
regretting
that
suit
and
certainly
i
often
see
children
now
whose
costumes
are
at
least
equally
absurd
chapter
iv
a
tour
in
wales
in
extracts
from
my
journal
of
this
my
inborn
love
for
beautiful
stay
at
anglesea
and
reasons
for
specially
remembering
this
tour
the
pleasantest
recollections
i
have
of
my
father
are
connected
with
a
tour
in
wales
that
he
undertook
with
me
and
his
eldest
sister
in
the
summer
of
my
aunt
made
me
keep
a
journal
of
that
tour
which
i
still
possess
and
by
its
help
those
days
come
hack
to
me
with
a
vividness
that
is
very
astonishing
to
myself
being
accustomed
to
live
with
people
and
having
no
companions
of
my
own
age
in
the
same
house
though
i
had
cousins
at
hollins
and
friends
at
school
i
had
acquired
a
way
of
talking
about
things
as
older
people
talk
so
that
the
journal
in
question
contains
many
observations
that
do
not
seem
natural
for
a
child
the
fact
no
doubt
is
that
i
listened
to
my
father
and
aunt
and
then
put
down
many
of
their
remarks
in
my
little
history
of
our
tour
but
i
was
very
observant
on
my
own
account
and
received
very
strong
impressions
especially
from
buildings
such
as
old
castles
and
cathedrals
and
great
houses
and
i
had
a
topographic
habit
of
mind
even
in
childhood
which
made
every
fresh
locality
interesting
to
me
and
engraved
it
on
my
memory
perhaps
the
reader
may
like
to
see
a
page
of
the
diary
it
seems
rather
formal
and
elderly
to
be
written
by
a
child
eight
years
old
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
was
an
exercise
written
by
my
father
desire
and
to
please
him
letters
to
my
cousins
at
the
same
date
would
have
been
more
juvenile
nevertheless
it
was
perfectly
natural
for
me
then
to
use
words
employed
by
older
people
and
the
reader
will
remember
that
i
had
been
learning
latin
for
more
than
two
years
on
the
road
from
rhydland
to
abergele
we
saw
hemmel
park
the
seat
of
lord
dinorbin
lately
burnt
down
near
rhydland
is
penwarn
the
seat
of
lord
mostyn
the
house
is
small
and
unpretending
the
grounds
are
beautiful
there
is
a
very
handsome
in
which
are
kept
couple
of
fine
ready
for
work
besides
old
ones
in
one
kennel
and
young
ones
in
another
the
dogs
all
in
such
good
order
and
kennels
so
perfectly
clean
in
one
field
were
sixteen
hunters
without
shoes
lord
mostyn
does
not
live
much
at
penwarn
generally
in
london
he
is
an
old
man
and
at
present
an
invalid
we
had
several
pleasant
days
fishing
in
the
clwyd
and
elway
a
graham
at
rhyl
has
permission
to
fish
in
lord
mostyn
preserve
and
he
may
take
a
friend
which
character
papa
and
i
personated
for
the
time
about
eight
miles
from
rhyl
is
trelacre
the
seat
of
sir
pyers
mostyn
a
very
excellent
modern
building
the
grounds
are
laid
out
with
most
luxuriant
taste
nothing
is
wanting
to
give
effect
to
it
as
a
whole
in
the
woods
opposite
the
house
is
a
rich
but
rather
formal
distribution
of
everything
appeared
to
be
in
blossom
on
an
elevation
is
placed
the
most
ingeniously
contrived
grotto
at
every
turn
there
is
a
device
of
another
character
to
the
last
here
a
lion
couchant
there
the
head
of
momus
a
wild
boar
head
a
heron
a
skeleton
in
one
place
were
two
old
friars
seated
each
leaning
on
his
stick
apparently
in
earnest
conversation
all
these
are
roughly
but
with
great
accuracy
formed
upon
the
numerous
pillars
which
support
a
room
or
two
above
the
last
object
you
arrive
at
is
a
hermit
as
large
as
life
seated
in
his
cell
with
one
book
beside
him
and
another
on
his
knee
upon
which
his
left
hand
is
placed
his
right
is
laid
across
his
breast
the
pillars
are
so
contrived
that
the
little
cavern
is
light
in
every
part
at
the
entrance
is
an
immense
with
large
glaring
eyes
and
a
long
red
tongue
hanging
out
the
monster
had
an
effect
somewhat
startling
next
above
the
grotto
is
a
small
room
hewn
out
of
the
rock
with
sofas
and
pillows
on
each
side
the
fireplace
hewn
out
of
the
same
rock
in
the
centre
is
a
stone
table
upon
which
were
some
beautiful
antique
bowls
cups
the
door
to
this
apartment
is
a
great
curiosity
being
made
to
appear
as
if
of
rock
we
did
not
think
at
first
that
it
was
a
real
door
over
this
room
is
another
the
residence
of
a
lame
woman
who
showed
us
upon
the
leads
above
her
dwelling
a
very
extensive
prospect
amongst
the
objects
was
the
mouth
of
the
river
dee
she
afterwards
took
us
to
a
moss
house
and
several
other
nice
points
in
the
garden
the
walks
are
covered
with
the
material
left
in
washing
the
lead
ore
through
which
no
weed
can
even
peep
it
is
and
the
glittering
of
here
and
there
a
bit
of
ore
lead
or
silver
has
a
very
pretty
effect
indeed
the
reader
will
have
had
enough
of
the
journal
by
this
time
its
only
merit
is
the
accurate
noting
down
of
details
that
i
had
seen
but
many
of
the
details
are
such
as
children
of
that
age
do
not
commonly
pay
attention
to
as
for
instance
in
this
bit
about
an
old
church
the
church
at
dyserth
has
an
east
window
which
is
considered
the
greatest
antiquity
in
wales
many
figures
of
the
saints
are
represented
in
colored
glass
the
lead
betwixt
the
panes
is
the
breadth
of
two
fingers
the
yard
has
several
old
trees
two
very
fine
yews
and
certainly
the
largest
birch
for
miles
round
i
notice
a
great
interest
in
all
beautiful
materials
throughout
the
pages
of
this
journal
the
kind
of
wood
used
for
the
suites
of
furniture
is
invariably
mentioned
as
for
example
the
chairs
of
solid
ebony
in
the
at
penrhyn
castle
the
old
oak
in
the
at
trelacre
and
the
light
oak
in
the
the
carved
oak
ceilings
and
pillars
at
penrhyn
and
the
use
of
stone
from
helen
there
as
well
as
the
bedstead
that
is
made
of
slate
and
the
enormous
table
of
the
same
material
in
the
servants
hall
the
interest
in
materials
is
a
special
instinct
a
kind
of
sympathy
with
nature
showing
itself
by
appreciation
of
the
different
qualities
of
her
products
this
instinct
has
always
been
very
strong
in
me
and
i
have
often
noticed
it
in
others
especially
in
artists
some
poets
are
very
fond
of
describing
beautiful
materials
but
the
instinct
is
not
confined
to
poetical
or
artistic
natures
being
often
found
amongst
workmen
in
the
handicrafts
and
it
may
be
associated
with
a
sense
of
the
usefulness
of
materials
as
well
as
with
admiration
of
their
beauty
with
me
the
interest
in
them
is
both
artistic
and
utilitarian
all
metals
woods
marble
are
delightful
to
me
in
some
way
in
rhyl
was
a
little
quiet
place
known
to
the
liverpool
people
as
a
good
but
not
spoiled
by
formal
rows
of
houses
and
big
hotels
there
was
at
that
time
in
rhyl
a
gentleman
who
possessed
a
sort
of
genteel
cottage
in
a
relatively
large
garden
and
though
the
house
was
small
it
might
have
done
for
a
widower
like
my
father
and
it
was
for
sale
i
remember
urging
my
father
to
buy
it
as
rhyl
pleased
me
on
account
of
the
possibilities
of
boating
and
riding
on
the
sands
besides
which
we
had
enjoyed
some
excellent
fishing
which
delighted
me
as
a
child
though
i
gave
up
the
amusement
afterwards
i
mention
the
house
here
for
a
particular
reason
it
has
remained
very
distinctly
in
my
memory
ever
since
as
my
father
last
chance
of
escape
from
his
habits
and
associates
whilst
we
were
in
wales
together
he
conducted
himself
as
a
man
ought
to
do
who
is
travelling
with
a
lady
and
a
child
he
was
not
harsh
with
me
and
notwithstanding
my
habitual
fear
of
him
some
of
my
welsh
days
with
him
are
pleasant
to
live
over
again
in
memory
now
if
he
had
bought
that
house
the
sort
of
life
we
were
then
leading
might
have
become
habitual
and
he
might
possibly
have
been
saved
from
the
sad
fate
that
awaited
him
however
though
tempted
for
a
moment
he
refused
because
it
did
not
seem
a
good
investment
being
a
flimsy
little
building
not
very
well
contrived
though
my
father
would
not
buy
the
house
to
please
me
he
bought
me
a
little
bay
mare
at
rhyl
that
was
a
pretty
and
swift
creature
and
we
took
her
on
the
steamer
to
menai
where
for
want
of
a
convenient
arrangement
for
landing
horses
she
was
pitched
into
the
sea
and
made
to
swim
ashore
she
had
been
in
a
hot
place
on
the
steamer
near
the
engines
and
the
sudden
change
to
the
cold
was
probably
so
we
thought
afterwards
the
reason
why
she
became
which
was
a
great
grief
to
me
i
hardly
know
why
i
record
these
trifles
but
they
have
an
importance
in
the
feelings
of
a
boy
and
i
am
weak
enough
to
have
very
tender
feelings
about
animals
down
to
the
present
day
we
visited
anglesea
and
caernarvon
and
other
places
too
well
known
for
the
reader
to
tolerate
a
description
of
them
here
in
those
days
the
tubular
bridge
had
not
yet
been
thought
of
but
the
beautiful
suspension
bridge
at
menai
was
already
in
existence
and
was
the
most
remarkable
bridge
then
existing
in
the
world
i
was
more
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
structure
than
by
its
costliness
or
size
the
journal
says
it
is
indeed
wonderfully
beautiful
on
one
of
our
excursions
we
saw
what
in
rainy
weather
is
a
good
waterfall
and
i
find
a
reference
to
this
that
i
quote
for
the
curious
bit
of
that
is
included
in
it
we
came
to
a
little
village
which
has
in
a
wet
season
a
very
fine
waterfall
the
driver
said
it
would
not
be
seen
to
advantage
because
there
was
water
there
certainly
was
water
but
the
fine
high
rocks
gave
a
powerful
idea
of
what
it
would
have
been
had
the
rushing
of
waters
taken
the
place
of
the
stillness
which
then
prevailed
the
reader
will
perhaps
pardon
me
for
having
dwelt
longer
on
this
welsh
tour
than
the
interest
of
it
may
seem
to
warrant
but
i
look
back
to
it
with
lingering
regret
as
the
last
agreeable
association
connected
with
the
memory
of
my
father
it
was
a
most
happy
little
tour
i
had
an
intensely
strong
affection
for
my
father
eldest
sister
mary
who
accompanied
us
and
whose
dear
handwriting
i
recognize
in
a
few
corrections
in
the
journal
besides
that
year
is
absolutely
the
last
year
of
my
life
in
which
i
could
live
in
happy
ignorance
of
evil
and
retain
all
the
buoyancy
of
early
boyhood
a
terrible
experience
was
in
reserve
for
me
that
soon
aged
me
rapidly
and
made
a
really
merry
boyish
life
impossible
for
me
after
having
passed
through
it
chapter
a
painful
chapter
to
my
father
calls
me
what
kind
of
a
house
it
paternal
education
and
my
life
at
that
time
one
of
dulness
varied
by
dread
the
writing
of
this
chapter
is
so
painful
to
me
that
the
necessity
for
it
has
made
me
put
off
the
composition
of
this
autobiography
year
after
year
then
why
not
omit
the
chapter
altogether
the
omission
is
impossible
because
the
events
of
the
year
were
quite
the
most
important
of
my
early
boyhood
and
have
had
a
most
powerful
and
in
some
respects
a
disastrous
influence
over
my
whole
life
notwithstanding
my
father
kindness
to
me
during
our
welsh
tour
my
feelings
towards
him
were
not
and
could
not
be
those
of
trust
and
confidence
he
was
extremely
severe
at
times
often
much
more
so
than
the
occasion
warranted
this
being
partly
natural
in
a
strong
authoritative
man
and
partly
the
result
of
irritability
brought
on
by
his
habit
of
drinking
when
inflamed
with
brandy
he
became
positively
dangerous
and
i
had
a
dread
of
his
presence
at
all
times
he
was
very
uncertain
he
might
greet
me
with
a
kind
word
or
he
might
be
harsh
or
silent
just
as
it
happened
during
my
visits
to
him
at
shaw
one
of
my
two
aunts
invariably
accompanied
me
and
stayed
as
long
as
i
stayed
which
was
a
great
protection
for
me
the
idea
of
being
left
alone
with
my
father
even
for
a
day
was
enough
to
fill
me
with
apprehension
however
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
i
should
have
to
live
with
him
as
i
should
probably
be
sent
to
some
distant
school
and
only
come
home
for
the
holidays
this
was
the
view
of
my
future
that
was
taken
by
my
aunts
and
myself
when
one
day
in
the
year
i
believe
in
the
month
of
june
there
came
a
letter
from
my
father
peremptorily
declaring
in
terms
which
admitted
of
no
discussion
that
although
a
child
might
live
with
ladies
it
was
not
good
for
a
boy
and
that
he
had
determined
to
have
me
for
the
future
under
his
own
roof
the
news
came
upon
me
like
a
thunderclap
in
a
clear
sky
i
had
grateful
and
affectionate
feelings
towards
both
my
aunts
but
to
the
elder
my
feelings
were
those
of
a
son
and
a
very
loving
son
towards
his
mother
she
had
in
fact
taken
the
place
of
my
mother
so
completely
that
i
remained
unconscious
of
my
loss
i
reserve
for
a
pleasanter
chapter
than
this
the
delightful
duty
of
painting
her
portrait
at
present
it
is
enough
to
say
that
a
separation
from
her
in
childhood
was
the
most
bitter
grief
that
could
be
experienced
by
me
and
my
father
ukase
made
this
separation
seem
destined
to
be
eternal
except
perhaps
a
short
visit
in
the
holidays
in
a
word
my
filial
life
with
her
seemed
at
an
end
i
was
taken
to
my
father
and
left
alone
with
him
some
years
before
he
had
bought
a
house
in
shaw
called
ivy
cottage
a
house
with
a
front
of
painted
stucco
looking
on
a
garden
and
though
the
gable
end
of
the
house
looked
on
a
street
the
other
end
had
a
view
over
some
fields
not
then
built
over
my
father
rented
one
or
two
of
these
fields
for
his
horses
and
cows
and
some
farm
buildings
just
big
enough
for
his
small
establishment
he
did
not
keep
a
carriage
and
had
even
given
up
his
dogcart
but
he
always
had
a
for
himself
and
a
pony
for
me
at
one
time
i
had
two
ponies
his
horses
were
his
only
luxury
but
he
was
as
exacting
about
them
as
if
he
had
been
a
rich
nobleman
he
would
not
tolerate
careless
grooming
for
an
instant
bits
and
stirrups
were
always
kept
in
a
state
of
exemplary
brightness
and
when
he
rode
through
shaw
he
was
quite
fit
to
be
seen
in
hyde
park
at
that
time
he
had
a
mare
of
a
vicious
temper
which
only
gratified
his
pride
as
a
horseman
and
it
so
happened
i
am
not
inventing
this
for
a
contrast
that
my
pony
was
of
the
purest
white
with
full
mane
and
tail
of
the
same
and
shaped
exactly
like
the
sturdy
in
old
pictures
as
he
was
still
a
handsome
man
and
i
was
a
healthy
boy
no
doubt
we
looked
well
enough
and
it
is
probable
that
many
a
poor
factory
lad
envied
me
my
good
luck
in
being
able
to
ride
about
in
that
way
instead
of
working
in
a
mill
but
i
rode
in
constant
dread
of
my
father
heavy
it
had
a
steel
hammer
at
the
end
of
the
long
handle
and
if
at
any
time
its
owner
fancied
that
i
was
turning
my
toes
out
he
did
not
say
anything
but
with
a
dexterity
acquired
by
practice
he
delivered
a
sharp
blow
with
that
hammer
on
my
foot
which
made
me
writhe
with
pain
nothing
vexed
him
more
than
any
appearance
of
gentleness
or
tenderness
i
loved
my
pony
lily
and
did
not
like
to
beat
her
when
she
was
doing
her
best
and
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
my
father
mare
so
he
would
say
d
n
it
ca
you
whip
her
ca
you
whip
better
than
that
the
strokes
of
that
whip
of
yours
are
so
feeble
that
they
would
kill
a
fly
nobody
could
say
that
of
hitting
i
had
a
little
young
dog
that
was
very
dear
to
me
and
when
it
pleased
my
father
one
day
to
walk
into
the
kitchen
it
unluckily
so
happened
that
the
dog
was
or
seemed
to
be
in
his
way
so
he
gave
it
a
kick
that
sent
it
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
there
it
lay
quivering
he
took
no
notice
of
it
said
what
he
had
to
say
in
his
usual
peremptory
tone
and
then
left
the
room
i
knelt
down
by
the
poor
little
dog
which
was
in
its
and
shortly
breathed
its
last
during
our
rides
my
dreaded
companion
would
stop
at
many
inns
and
private
houses
where
he
slaked
his
perpetual
thirst
in
or
sometimes
he
would
go
in
and
sit
for
a
long
time
whilst
the
horses
were
cared
for
by
some
groom
the
effects
of
these
refreshments
could
not
fail
to
be
evident
as
we
returned
home
and
it
was
more
by
good
luck
than
anything
else
except
his
habitually
excellent
horsemanship
that
he
was
able
to
ride
at
all
in
that
condition
i
clearly
remember
one
particular
occasion
when
he
seemed
to
be
keeping
his
seat
with
more
than
usual
uncertainty
and
at
last
fairly
rolled
out
of
it
we
were
riding
along
a
paved
street
so
that
the
fall
would
have
been
very
serious
but
two
or
three
men
who
were
watching
him
foresaw
the
accident
just
in
time
and
rushed
forward
to
catch
him
as
he
fell
on
another
occasion
when
i
was
not
present
indeed
this
happened
before
my
settled
residence
with
my
father
he
fell
in
a
most
dangerous
way
with
his
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
and
was
dragged
violently
down
a
steep
hill
till
the
horse
was
brought
to
a
stand
fortunately
my
father
wore
a
at
the
time
which
was
soon
torn
off
his
back
by
the
friction
and
so
were
his
other
clothes
and
the
back
itself
was
almost
flayed
but
the
doctor
said
that
if
he
had
been
lightly
dressed
the
accident
would
have
been
far
more
serious
my
father
would
sometimes
send
me
on
errands
to
a
considerable
distance
with
the
pony
and
as
he
hated
all
dawdling
and
loitering
in
others
though
he
had
become
a
perfectly
undisciplined
man
himself
he
would
limit
me
strictly
to
the
time
necessary
for
my
journey
a
time
that
i
never
ventured
to
exceed
in
some
respects
the
education
that
he
was
giving
me
though
of
spartan
severity
was
not
ill
calculated
for
the
formation
of
a
manly
character
he
quite
understood
the
importance
of
applying
the
mind
completely
to
the
thing
which
occupied
it
for
the
moment
if
he
saw
me
taking
several
books
together
that
had
no
connection
with
each
other
he
would
say
take
one
of
those
books
and
read
it
steadily
do
potter
and
play
with
desultory
effort
irritated
him
and
he
was
quick
to
detect
busy
idleness
under
its
various
disguises
he
swore
very
freely
himself
and
as
i
heard
so
many
oaths
i
was
beginning
to
acquire
the
same
accomplishment
when
he
overheard
me
accidentally
and
gave
me
such
a
stern
lecture
on
the
subject
that
i
knew
ever
after
i
was
not
to
follow
the
paternal
example
what
his
soul
hated
most
however
was
a
lie
or
the
shadow
of
a
lie
he
could
not
tolerate
the
little
fibs
that
are
common
with
women
and
children
and
are
often
their
only
protection
against
despotism
tell
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
was
one
of
his
favorite
precepts
though
why
the
devil
should
feel
ashamed
because
i
spoke
the
truth
was
never
perfectly
clear
to
my
childish
intellect
however
the
precept
sank
deep
into
my
nature
and
got
mixed
up
with
a
feeling
of
so
that
it
became
really
difficult
for
me
to
tell
fibs
i
remember
on
one
occasion
being
a
martyr
for
truth
in
peculiarly
trying
circumstances
it
was
before
i
lived
permanently
under
the
paternal
roof
and
on
one
of
those
visits
we
paid
to
my
father
an
aunt
was
with
me
not
the
one
who
accompanied
us
to
wales
and
she
was
often
rather
hard
and
severe
my
father
had
made
a
law
that
i
was
to
practise
with
a
quarter
of
an
hour
every
morning
and
this
exercise
was
taken
in
the
garden
but
before
beginning
i
always
looked
at
the
clock
which
was
in
the
on
coming
back
into
the
house
one
morning
i
met
my
father
who
said
have
you
done
your
fifteen
minutes
yes
papa
that
is
not
true
said
my
aunt
from
the
next
room
he
has
only
practised
for
ten
minutes
look
at
the
clock
my
terrible
master
looked
at
the
clock
the
finger
stood
at
ten
minutes
after
eleven
and
this
was
taken
as
conclusive
evidence
against
me
i
simply
answered
what
was
true
that
i
had
begun
five
minutes
before
the
hour
this
additional
lie
put
my
father
into
a
fury
and
he
ordered
me
to
do
punishment
drill
with
those
for
two
hours
without
stopping
of
those
hundred
and
twenty
minutes
he
did
not
remit
one
long
before
their
expiration
i
was
ready
to
drop
but
he
came
frequently
to
show
that
he
had
his
eye
upon
me
and
the
horrible
motion
must
continue
on
other
occasions
i
got
punished
for
lying
when
my
only
fault
was
the
common
childish
inability
to
explain
why
did
you
tear
that
piece
of
paper
please
papa
i
did
not
tear
it
pulled
it
and
it
here
is
a
child
attempting
to
explain
that
he
had
not
torn
a
piece
of
paper
voluntarily
that
he
had
stretched
it
only
and
had
himself
been
surprised
by
the
tearing
in
my
father
code
that
was
a
confounded
lie
and
i
was
to
be
severely
punished
for
it
his
system
of
education
included
riding
as
an
essential
part
and
that
he
taught
me
well
so
far
as
a
child
of
that
age
could
learn
it
but
though
there
were
harriers
within
a
few
miles
he
could
not
take
me
to
hunt
as
children
are
sometimes
taken
in
easier
countries
the
fields
in
lancashire
being
so
frequently
divided
by
stone
walls
the
nature
of
our
neighborhood
equally
prevented
him
from
teaching
me
to
swim
which
he
would
otherwise
have
done
as
there
were
no
streams
deep
enough
or
left
in
their
natural
purity
to
accustom
me
to
water
however
he
made
me
take
cold
certainly
the
best
substitute
for
a
plunge
that
can
be
had
in
an
ordinary
room
in
mental
education
he
attached
great
importance
to
common
things
to
arithmetic
for
example
and
to
good
reading
aloud
and
intelligible
writing
his
own
education
had
been
very
limited
he
knew
no
modern
language
but
his
own
and
i
believe
he
knew
no
greek
whatever
and
only
just
enough
latin
for
a
solicitor
which
in
those
days
was
not
very
much
but
if
he
was
a
philistine
in
neglecting
his
own
culture
he
had
not
the
real
philistine
contempt
for
culture
in
others
and
desired
to
have
me
well
taught
yet
there
was
nobody
near
at
hand
to
continue
my
higher
education
properly
and
i
was
likely
had
we
lived
long
together
at
shaw
to
become
like
the
regular
englishmen
of
those
days
who
from
sheer
want
of
preliminary
training
were
impervious
to
the
best
influences
of
literature
and
art
i
might
have
written
a
clear
business
letter
and
calculated
interest
accurately
to
accustom
me
to
money
matters
child
as
i
was
my
father
placed
gold
and
silver
in
my
keeping
and
whatever
i
spent
was
to
be
accounted
for
in
this
way
money
was
not
to
be
an
imaginary
thing
for
me
but
a
real
thing
and
i
was
not
to
lose
the
control
of
myself
because
i
had
my
pocket
full
of
sovereigns
this
was
a
very
original
scheme
in
its
application
to
so
young
a
child
but
it
perfectly
succeeded
and
i
never
either
lost
or
misapplied
one
halfpenny
of
the
sums
my
father
entrusted
to
my
keeping
he
was
evidently
pleased
with
his
success
in
this
there
was
a
village
school
near
his
house
kept
by
a
respectable
man
for
children
of
both
sexes
and
there
i
was
sent
to
practise
calligraphy
and
arithmetic
during
there
was
at
least
complete
relief
from
the
paternal
supervision
and
besides
this
i
managed
to
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
about
a
year
older
than
myself
who
was
a
very
nice
girl
indeed
though
she
squinted
to
an
unfortunate
degree
that
is
the
great
advantage
of
having
the
young
of
both
sexes
in
the
same
schoolroom
the
manners
of
the
brutal
sex
may
be
made
tender
by
the
presence
of
the
refined
one
boys
and
girls
both
went
to
the
grammar
school
at
burnley
in
the
now
forgotten
days
when
raws
was
there
but
that
was
long
before
my
time
my
existence
at
ivy
cottage
was
one
of
extreme
dulness
varied
by
dread
every
meal
was
a
with
my
father
unrelieved
by
the
presence
of
any
lady
or
young
person
and
he
became
more
and
more
gloomy
as
his
nervous
system
gradually
gave
way
so
that
after
having
been
simply
stern
and
unbending
he
was
now
like
a
black
cloud
always
hanging
over
me
and
ready
as
it
seemed
to
be
my
destruction
in
some
way
or
other
not
yet
clearly
defined
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
me
when
a
guest
came
to
dinner
and
i
remember
being
once
very
much
interested
in
a
gentleman
who
sat
opposite
me
at
table
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
believed
him
to
be
the
duke
of
wellington
there
was
rather
more
fuss
than
usual
in
the
way
of
preparation
and
my
father
treated
his
guest
with
marked
deference
besides
which
the
stranger
had
the
wellingtonian
nose
so
my
youthful
mind
was
soon
made
up
on
the
subject
and
i
listened
eagerly
in
the
hope
that
the
hero
of
waterloo
would
fight
some
of
his
battles
over
again
he
remained
however
silent
on
that
subject
and
i
afterwards
had
the
disappointment
of
learning
that
our
guest
was
not
the
duke
but
only
the
holder
of
a
high
office
in
the
county
chapter
vi
my
extreme
thoughts
of
my
father
last
illness
and
circumstances
of
my
last
interview
with
his
funeral
it
was
one
of
the
effects
of
the
constant
anxiety
and
excitement
and
the
dreadful
wretchedness
of
that
time
that
my
brain
received
the
images
of
all
surrounding
creatures
and
things
with
an
unnatural
clearness
and
intensity
and
that
they
were
impressed
upon
it
for
life
even
now
everything
about
ivy
cottage
is
as
clear
as
if
the
forty
years
were
only
as
many
days
and
the
writing
of
these
chapters
brings
everything
before
me
most
vividly
not
only
the
faces
of
the
people
and
the
habits
and
motions
of
the
animals
but
even
the
furniture
of
which
i
remember
every
detail
down
to
the
coloring
of
the
services
in
the
bedrooms
and
the
paint
on
my
father
an
anecdote
has
been
told
in
these
pages
about
exercise
with
and
an
appeal
to
the
clock
in
writing
that
i
saw
the
real
clock
with
the
moon
on
its
face
for
it
showed
the
phases
of
the
moon
and
my
aunt
standing
near
the
window
with
her
work
in
her
hand
and
glancing
up
from
the
work
to
the
clock
just
as
she
did
in
reality
amongst
other
particular
occasions
i
remember
one
night
when
the
moon
shone
very
brightly
in
the
garden
and
i
was
sitting
near
my
bedroom
window
looking
over
it
meditating
flight
my
father
cruelty
had
then
reached
its
highest
point
i
was
always
spoken
to
harshly
when
he
condescended
to
take
any
notice
of
me
at
all
and
was
very
frequently
beaten
our
meals
together
had
become
perfectly
intolerable
he
would
sit
and
trifle
with
his
cutlet
and
cover
it
with
pepper
for
his
appetite
was
completely
gone
and
there
was
no
conversation
except
perhaps
an
occasional
expression
of
displeasure
the
continual
tension
caused
by
anxiety
made
my
sleep
broken
and
uncertain
and
that
night
i
sat
up
alone
in
the
bedroom
longer
than
usual
and
looking
down
upon
the
moonlit
garden
there
was
an
octagonal
of
on
the
formal
oblong
lawn
and
on
the
top
of
it
was
a
large
hollow
ball
of
painted
green
that
had
cost
my
grandmother
three
pounds
it
is
oddly
associated
with
my
anxieties
on
that
night
because
i
looked
first
at
it
and
then
at
the
moon
alternately
whilst
thinking
the
situation
had
become
absolutely
intolerable
the
servants
were
my
only
protectors
and
though
devoted
they
never
dared
to
interfere
when
their
master
was
actually
beating
me
i
therefore
seriously
weighed
in
my
own
childish
manner
the
possibilities
of
a
secret
flight
the
moonlight
was
tempting
it
would
be
easy
to
go
alone
to
the
stable
and
saddle
the
pony
on
a
fine
night
i
could
be
many
miles
away
before
morning
there
was
no
difficulty
whatever
about
money
i
had
plenty
of
sovereigns
in
a
drawer
to
be
accounted
for
afterwards
to
my
father
and
meanwhile
could
employ
them
in
escaping
from
him
still
i
knew
that
such
an
employment
of
money
would
be
looked
upon
by
him
as
a
breach
of
trust
and
would
in
fact
a
breach
of
trust
this
consideration
was
not
easily
set
aside
though
i
now
see
that
it
was
needlessly
scrupulous
and
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
a
child
is
left
by
the
ignorance
or
the
carelessness
of
superior
authority
in
the
hands
of
a
madman
it
has
a
clear
right
to
provide
for
its
own
safety
by
any
means
in
its
power
but
where
was
i
to
go
my
uncles
were
two
very
cool
lawyers
always
on
the
side
of
authority
and
they
would
not
be
likely
to
believe
my
story
entirely
a
vague
but
sure
instinct
warned
me
that
they
would
set
me
down
for
a
rebellious
boy
who
wanted
to
escape
from
justly
severe
paternal
authority
and
that
they
would
at
once
send
me
back
to
ivy
cottage
one
of
my
two
maiden
aunts
would
be
very
likely
to
take
the
same
view
but
if
the
other
received
me
with
kindness
she
could
not
have
strength
to
resist
my
father
who
would
send
or
go
to
her
at
once
and
claim
me
after
thinking
over
all
these
things
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
real
safety
was
only
to
be
found
amongst
strangers
and
it
seemed
so
hazardous
to
ask
protection
from
unknown
people
that
i
decided
to
remain
but
a
very
little
would
have
settled
it
the
other
way
if
those
sovereigns
had
been
really
my
own
i
should
probably
have
crept
out
of
the
house
saddled
the
pony
and
ridden
many
miles
but
so
young
a
boy
travelling
alone
would
have
been
sure
to
attract
attention
and
the
attempt
to
win
deliverance
would
have
been
a
failure
in
after
years
one
of
my
elder
relatives
said
that
the
attempt
would
almost
certainly
have
caused
my
father
to
disinherit
me
by
a
new
will
as
my
mother
property
had
been
left
to
him
absolutely
this
danger
was
quite
of
a
serious
kind
more
serious
than
the
reader
will
think
probable
from
what
i
choose
to
say
in
this
place
as
my
father
had
another
heir
in
view
whom
i
never
saw
but
who
was
held
over
me
i
awoke
one
bleak
winter
morning
about
five
and
heard
the
strangest
cries
proceeding
from
his
room
his
manservant
had
been
awakened
before
me
and
had
gone
to
the
room
already
where
he
was
engaged
in
a
sort
of
wrestling
match
with
my
father
who
in
the
belief
that
the
house
was
full
of
enemies
was
endeavoring
to
throw
himself
out
of
the
window
other
men
had
been
called
for
who
speedily
arrived
and
they
overpowered
him
though
even
the
remnant
of
his
mighty
strength
was
such
that
it
took
six
men
to
hold
him
on
his
bed
the
attack
lasted
a
whole
week
and
the
house
would
have
been
a
perfect
hell
had
not
a
certain
event
turned
it
for
me
into
a
paradise
i
had
not
been
able
somehow
to
get
to
sleep
late
at
night
for
a
short
time
when
a
light
in
the
room
awoke
me
the
horrible
life
i
had
been
leading
for
many
a
day
and
night
had
produced
a
great
impressionability
and
i
was
particularly
afraid
of
my
father
in
the
so
i
started
up
in
bed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
come
to
beat
me
when
lo
instead
of
his
terrible
face
i
saw
what
for
me
was
the
sweetest
and
dearest
face
in
the
whole
world
it
was
his
sister
mary
she
who
had
taken
my
mother
place
and
whom
i
loved
with
a
mingled
sentiment
of
filial
tenderness
and
gratitude
that
remained
undiminished
in
force
though
it
may
have
altered
in
character
during
all
the
after
years
for
the
suddenness
of
revulsion
from
horror
to
happiness
there
has
never
been
a
minute
in
my
existence
comparable
to
the
minute
when
i
realized
the
idea
that
she
had
come
at
first
it
seemed
only
a
deceptive
dream
such
happiness
was
incredible
and
i
did
not
even
know
she
had
been
sent
for
but
the
sweet
reality
entered
into
my
heart
like
sunshine
and
throwing
my
arms
about
her
neck
i
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
she
in
her
quiet
way
for
she
hardly
ever
yielded
to
a
strong
emotion
though
her
feelings
were
deep
and
tender
looked
at
me
sadly
and
kindly
and
told
me
to
sleep
in
peace
as
she
was
going
to
remain
in
the
house
some
time
then
she
left
the
room
and
i
lay
in
the
darkness
but
with
a
new
light
brighter
than
sunshine
in
the
hope
that
the
miserable
life
with
my
father
had
at
length
come
to
an
end
it
had
only
been
six
months
in
all
but
it
had
seemed
longer
than
any
years
gone
through
before
or
after
if
this
book
were
a
novel
a
very
effective
chapter
might
be
written
to
describe
my
father
sufferings
during
his
week
of
delirium
and
all
the
dreadful
fancies
by
which
his
disordered
brain
was
oppressed
and
tortured
but
i
prefer
to
skip
that
week
altogether
and
come
to
a
morning
when
his
recovery
was
thought
to
be
assured
he
was
no
longer
delirious
but
apparently
quite
calm
though
his
manner
was
hard
and
imperious
he
ordered
me
to
be
sent
up
to
him
and
i
went
almost
trembling
with
the
old
dread
of
him
and
with
a
wretched
feeling
that
after
my
single
week
of
respite
the
tyranny
was
to
begin
again
such
may
have
been
the
feelings
of
an
escaped
slave
when
he
has
been
caught
and
brought
back
in
irons
and
stands
once
more
in
his
master
presence
i
tried
to
congratulate
my
master
on
his
recovery
in
a
clumsy
childish
way
but
he
peremptorily
ordered
me
to
fetch
the
times
and
read
to
him
i
began
as
usual
one
of
the
leading
articles
on
the
politics
of
the
day
and
before
i
had
read
many
sentences
my
hearer
declared
that
i
was
reading
badly
and
made
the
article
nonsense
why
had
i
put
in
such
and
such
words
of
my
own
he
asked
his
own
precept
that
i
was
always
to
tell
the
truth
under
any
circumstances
had
habituated
me
to
be
truthful
even
to
him
so
i
answered
boldly
that
i
had
not
inserted
the
words
attributed
to
me
then
i
read
a
little
farther
and
he
accused
me
of
inserting
something
else
that
was
not
and
could
not
be
in
the
text
i
said
it
was
he
who
was
mistaken
and
he
flew
into
an
uncontrollable
fury
one
of
those
rages
in
which
it
had
been
his
custom
to
punish
me
without
mercy
what
he
might
have
done
to
me
i
can
not
tell
he
raised
himself
in
bed
and
glared
at
me
with
an
expression
never
to
be
forgotten
my
aunt
however
had
been
listening
at
the
door
thinking
it
probable
that
i
should
be
in
danger
and
she
now
opened
it
and
told
me
to
come
away
i
have
a
confused
recollection
of
reaching
the
door
under
a
parting
volley
of
imprecations
it
was
a
mistake
to
let
my
father
see
me
as
in
the
perverted
state
of
his
mind
the
mere
sight
of
me
was
enough
to
make
him
furious
whether
he
hated
me
or
not
nobody
knows
but
he
treated
me
as
if
i
was
the
most
odious
little
object
that
could
be
brought
before
his
eyes
very
soon
after
the
scene
about
the
article
in
the
times
and
probably
in
consequence
of
the
excitement
brought
on
by
it
my
father
had
a
fit
of
apoplexy
and
lingered
till
the
next
morning
about
nine
i
was
not
in
the
room
when
he
died
but
my
aunt
took
me
to
see
him
immediately
after
and
then
i
received
an
impression
which
has
lasted
to
the
present
day
the
corpse
was
lying
on
its
side
amidst
disordered
bedclothes
and
to
this
day
i
can
never
go
into
a
bedroom
where
the
bed
has
not
been
made
without
feeling
as
if
there
were
a
corpse
in
it
that
dreadful
childish
sensation
received
when
i
saw
my
father
body
just
as
it
lay
at
the
close
of
the
can
even
now
be
revived
by
the
sight
of
a
disordered
bed
such
is
the
force
of
early
impressions
especially
when
they
are
received
by
a
nervous
system
that
has
been
overwrought
by
the
extreme
of
mental
wretchedness
the
reader
will
hardly
believe
that
the
death
of
so
hard
a
father
could
have
been
felt
otherwise
than
as
an
inexpressible
relief
and
yet
i
was
deeply
affected
by
his
loss
the
kindest
of
fathers
could
hardly
have
been
wept
for
more
my
aunt
tears
were
more
explicable
she
was
old
enough
to
understand
the
frightful
waste
of
the
best
gifts
involved
in
that
premature
ending
as
for
my
grief
perhaps
the
true
explanation
of
it
may
be
that
i
mourned
rather
the
father
who
had
been
kind
to
me
in
wales
than
the
cruel
master
at
ivy
cottage
i
sometimes
try
to
imagine
what
he
might
have
been
under
more
favorable
circumstances
there
were
times
after
his
wife
death
when
he
meditated
a
complete
change
of
residence
which
might
have
saved
him
he
would
always
have
been
severe
and
authoritative
but
without
alcohol
he
would
probably
not
have
been
cruel
i
remember
the
day
of
the
funeral
quite
distinctly
my
father
two
brothers
came
though
he
had
had
scarcely
any
intercourse
with
them
for
years
they
were
most
respectable
men
quite
free
from
my
errors
but
they
had
not
half
his
life
and
energy
such
was
the
strength
of
his
constitution
that
so
recently
as
the
time
of
our
journey
in
wales
his
health
was
not
visibly
impaired
and
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
had
that
rare
possession
for
a
man
of
a
complete
set
of
perfectly
sound
teeth
his
coffin
was
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
six
men
from
ivy
cottage
to
the
graveyard
near
the
chapel
shaw
at
that
time
had
only
a
chapel
a
hideous
building
on
a
bleak
piece
of
rising
ground
surrounded
by
many
graves
it
never
looked
more
dreary
than
on
that
wretched
january
day
in
when
we
stood
round
as
the
sexton
threw
earth
on
my
coffin
he
was
laid
in
the
same
tomb
with
the
poor
young
wife
who
had
loved
him
truly
and
to
whom
he
had
been
a
tender
and
devoted
husband
whilst
their
short
union
lasted
i
am
the
only
survivor
of
that
day
ceremony
the
little
procession
has
all
followed
my
father
into
the
darkness
descending
one
by
one
into
graves
separated
by
great
spaces
of
land
and
sea
and
when
this
is
printed
i
too
shall
be
asleep
in
mine
chapter
vii
dislike
to
shaw
in
consequence
of
the
dreadful
life
i
led
there
with
my
my
her
plan
for
my
doncaster
mr
cape
and
his
the
usher
intolerance
of
dissenters
my
feeling
for
architecture
and
the
my
guardian
insists
on
my
learning
our
french
master
sig
a
painful
i
begin
to
learn
the
my
aversion
to
early
love
of
my
first
classical
studies
one
consequence
of
the
horrible
life
i
had
led
at
ivy
cottage
was
a
permanent
dislike
to
the
place
and
the
neighborhood
the
evil
effects
of
which
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
never
went
there
again
quite
willingly
after
my
father
death
my
grandmother
lived
in
the
village
and
i
was
taken
to
see
her
every
year
until
her
death
but
though
she
was
a
very
kind
old
lady
it
was
a
trial
to
me
to
visit
her
i
used
to
lie
awake
in
her
house
at
nights
realizing
those
horrible
nights
i
had
passed
at
ivy
cottage
with
such
extreme
intensity
that
it
seemed
as
if
my
father
might
enter
the
room
at
any
time
this
was
not
a
superstitious
dread
of
apparitions
but
the
association
of
ideas
brought
back
the
past
with
a
clearness
that
was
extremely
painful
even
now
at
a
distance
of
more
than
forty
years
i
avoid
whatever
reminds
me
of
that
time
and
am
not
sorry
that
this
narrative
now
leads
to
something
else
my
father
had
no
great
affection
for
his
brothers
who
on
their
part
could
not
have
much
esteem
for
him
so
there
was
a
mutual
coolness
which
prevented
him
from
appointing
either
of
them
to
be
my
guardian
probably
they
felt
this
as
a
slight
for
although
always
kind
to
me
they
held
completely
aloof
from
anything
like
paternal
interference
with
my
education
my
father
had
named
his
eldest
sister
mary
as
my
sole
guardian
with
two
lawyers
as
with
her
the
reader
will
probably
think
it
was
a
mistake
to
appoint
an
old
maid
to
be
guardian
to
a
boy
but
my
aunt
was
a
woman
of
excellent
sense
and
certainly
not
disposed
to
bring
me
up
effeminately
indeed
her
willingness
to
encourage
me
in
everything
manly
was
such
that
she
would
always
inflict
upon
herself
considerable
anxiety
about
my
safety
rather
than
prevent
me
from
taking
my
full
share
of
the
more
or
less
perilous
exercises
of
youth
as
to
my
education
and
profession
her
scheme
was
very
simple
and
clear
and
would
have
been
perfectly
rational
if
i
had
been
all
that
she
wished
me
to
be
according
to
her
plan
i
was
to
go
to
good
schools
first
and
then
be
prepared
for
oxford
by
tutors
and
become
a
clergyman
there
was
some
thought
at
one
time
of
sending
me
to
one
of
the
great
public
schools
but
this
was
abandoned
and
i
was
first
sent
to
burnley
school
again
and
then
after
the
summer
holidays
of
to
doncaster
where
i
was
a
boarder
in
the
house
of
the
a
word
from
me
in
favor
of
one
of
the
public
schools
would
probably
have
decided
my
guardian
to
send
me
there
but
there
was
a
in
my
total
want
of
social
and
scholastic
ambition
i
never
in
my
life
felt
the
faintest
desire
to
rise
in
the
world
either
by
making
the
acquaintance
of
people
of
rank
which
is
the
main
reason
why
boys
of
middling
station
are
sent
to
aristocratic
schools
or
by
getting
letters
put
after
my
name
as
a
reward
for
learning
what
had
no
intrinsic
charm
for
me
in
the
worldly
sense
i
never
had
any
ambition
whatever
it
seemed
rather
hard
after
living
at
burnley
with
my
kind
guardian
to
be
sent
to
doncaster
school
and
separated
from
her
for
five
months
at
a
time
but
she
thought
the
separation
necessary
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
she
dreaded
more
than
that
her
great
affection
might
spoil
me
always
gentle
in
her
ways
always
kind
and
considerate
that
admirable
woman
had
still
a
remarkable
firmness
of
character
and
would
act
on
due
occasion
in
direct
opposition
both
to
her
own
feelings
and
to
mine
if
she
believed
that
duty
required
it
in
those
days
there
was
no
railway
station
at
doncaster
and
my
guardian
took
me
from
featherstone
where
her
hinde
was
vicar
to
doncaster
in
a
hired
carriage
i
remember
that
it
was
an
open
carriage
and
we
had
nobody
with
us
except
the
driver
and
it
was
a
fine
hot
day
in
august
i
remember
the
long
road
the
arrival
at
an
inn
at
doncaster
not
far
from
the
new
church
and
my
first
presentation
to
cape
the
who
seemed
a
very
kind
and
gentle
sort
of
clergyman
to
a
boy
not
yet
acquainted
with
his
cane
then
i
was
left
alone
in
the
strange
school
not
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
if
it
had
been
difficult
to
restrain
tears
when
my
guardian
left
me
it
became
impossible
in
the
little
iron
bed
in
the
dormitory
at
night
there
were
not
many
boarders
perhaps
a
dozen
and
three
or
four
private
pupils
who
were
preparing
for
cambridge
all
these
were
lodged
in
the
house
which
was
in
a
pleasant
open
part
of
the
town
on
the
road
leading
to
the
just
beyond
the
salutation
hotel
besides
these
there
were
rather
a
large
number
of
day
scholars
i
forget
how
many
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
and
in
those
days
the
schoolhouse
was
a
ground
floor
under
the
old
theatre
we
marched
down
thither
in
the
morning
under
the
control
of
an
usher
who
was
always
with
us
in
our
walks
this
usher
whose
name
i
well
remember
but
do
not
choose
to
print
was
a
vulgar
overbearing
man
whom
it
was
difficult
to
like
yet
at
the
same
time
we
all
felt
that
he
was
a
very
valuable
master
boys
feel
the
difference
between
a
master
who
is
a
gentleman
and
one
who
falls
short
of
that
ideal
we
were
clearly
aware
that
the
cape
was
a
gentleman
and
that
the
usher
was
not
nevertheless
in
spite
of
his
occasional
coarseness
and
even
brutality
the
usher
was
a
painstaking
honest
fellow
who
did
his
duty
very
energetically
his
best
quality
which
i
appreciate
far
more
now
than
i
did
then
was
an
extreme
readiness
to
help
a
willing
boy
in
his
work
by
clearly
explaining
those
difficulties
that
are
likely
to
stop
him
in
his
progress
cape
was
more
an
examiner
than
a
teacher
at
least
for
us
with
the
private
pupils
he
may
have
been
more
didactic
the
usher
evidently
liked
to
be
asked
he
was
extremely
helpful
to
me
and
thanks
to
him
chiefly
i
made
very
rapid
progress
at
doncaster
unfortunately
an
occasional
injustice
made
it
difficult
to
be
so
grateful
to
him
as
we
ought
to
have
been
here
is
an
example
one
evening
in
the
playground
he
told
me
to
get
on
the
back
of
another
boy
and
then
thrashed
me
with
a
switch
from
an
i
begged
to
be
told
for
what
fault
this
punishment
was
inflicted
and
the
only
answer
he
condescended
to
give
me
was
that
a
master
owed
no
explanation
to
a
schoolboy
down
to
the
present
time
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
out
what
the
punishment
was
for
and
strongly
suspect
that
it
was
simply
to
exercise
the
usher
arm
which
was
a
powerful
one
he
was
a
fair
cricketer
though
rather
too
fat
for
that
exercise
and
a
capital
swimmer
for
which
his
fat
was
an
advantage
he
was
an
immoderate
sometimes
he
would
lay
a
train
of
snuff
on
the
back
of
his
hand
and
snuff
it
up
greedily
and
voluptuously
in
hot
weather
he
sometimes
sat
in
his
and
would
occasionally
amuse
himself
by
laying
the
snuff
on
his
thick
fat
arm
and
then
pass
it
all
under
his
nose
which
drew
it
up
as
the
pneumatic
discharging
machines
drew
grain
from
the
hold
of
a
vessel
the
odor
of
snuff
was
inseparable
from
his
person
on
sunday
mornings
we
were
made
to
read
chapters
in
the
bible
before
going
to
church
and
the
usher
who
was
preparing
himself
to
enter
holy
orders
would
sometimes
talk
to
us
a
little
about
theology
once
he
said
that
the
establishment
of
religious
toleration
in
england
had
been
a
deplorable
mistake
and
that
dissent
ought
not
to
be
permitted
by
the
sovereign
this
frank
expression
of
perfect
intolerance
rather
surprised
me
even
then
and
i
did
not
quite
know
whether
it
would
be
just
to
extirpate
dissent
or
not
my
principal
feeling
about
the
matter
was
the
prejudice
inherited
by
young
english
gentlemen
of
old
tory
families
that
dissent
was
something
indescribably
low
and
quite
beneath
the
attention
of
a
gentleman
still
to
go
farther
and
compel
dissenters
by
force
to
attend
the
services
of
the
church
of
england
did
seem
to
me
rather
hard
and
on
thinking
over
the
matter
seriously
in
my
own
mind
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
usher
must
be
wrong
unless
dissenters
were
guilty
of
some
crime
i
was
not
aware
of
but
this
after
all
seemed
quite
possible
we
were
taken
to
the
services
in
doncaster
old
church
which
was
destroyed
by
fire
many
years
afterwards
though
not
yet
in
my
teens
i
had
an
intense
delight
in
architecture
and
deeply
enjoyed
the
noble
old
building
one
of
the
finest
of
its
class
in
england
our
pew
was
in
the
west
gallery
not
far
from
the
organ
and
from
it
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
interior
the
effect
of
the
music
was
very
strong
upon
me
as
the
instrument
was
a
fine
one
and
i
was
fully
alive
to
the
influence
of
music
and
architecture
in
combination
the
two
arts
go
together
far
better
than
architecture
and
painting
for
music
seems
to
make
architecture
alive
as
it
rolls
along
the
aisles
and
under
the
lofty
vaults
i
well
remember
feeling
when
some
noble
anthem
was
being
performed
as
if
the
sculptured
heads
between
the
arches
added
a
noble
animation
to
their
serenity
even
now
the
impression
received
in
those
early
days
still
remains
in
my
memory
with
considerable
clearness
and
fidelity
and
i
believe
that
the
habit
of
attending
service
in
such
a
beautiful
church
was
a
powerful
stimulus
to
an
inborn
passion
for
architecture
i
had
already
taken
lessons
in
drawing
of
the
kind
which
in
those
days
was
thought
suitable
for
boys
who
were
not
expected
to
be
professional
artists
so
the
at
doncaster
had
me
amongst
his
pupils
he
was
an
elderly
man
rather
stout
and
very
respectable
his
house
was
extremely
neat
and
tidy
with
proper
mahogany
furniture
and
no
artistic
eccentricities
of
any
kind
whatever
he
himself
was
always
irreproachably
dressed
and
he
wore
a
large
ruby
ring
on
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
to
us
boys
he
appeared
to
be
a
personage
of
great
dignity
but
we
were
not
afraid
of
him
in
spite
of
the
dignity
of
his
manners
as
he
could
not
apply
the
cane
he
was
not
unkind
yet
in
all
my
life
i
never
met
with
anybody
concerned
with
the
fine
arts
who
had
so
little
sympathy
so
little
enthusiasm
on
the
whole
he
was
distinctly
gentle
with
me
but
i
made
him
angry
twice
he
had
done
me
the
honor
to
promote
me
to
and
as
i
wanted
a
rag
to
wipe
my
slab
and
brushes
i
ventured
to
ask
for
one
on
which
he
turned
upon
me
a
glance
of
haughty
surprise
and
said
do
you
suppose
sir
that
i
can
undertake
to
supply
you
with
rags
this
will
give
an
idea
of
the
curiously
unsympathetic
nature
of
the
man
on
another
occasion
i
was
drawing
a
house
or
beginning
to
draw
one
when
the
master
came
to
look
over
my
shoulder
and
found
great
fault
with
me
for
beginning
with
the
upper
part
of
the
edifice
what
stonemason
or
bricklayer
said
he
would
think
of
building
his
chimney
before
he
had
laid
the
first
row
of
stones
on
the
foundation
a
young
pupil
must
not
correct
the
bad
reasoning
of
his
elders
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
cases
of
a
bricklayer
building
a
real
house
and
an
artist
representing
one
on
paper
were
not
precisely
the
same
later
in
life
i
found
that
the
best
artists
brought
their
works
forward
as
much
as
possible
simultaneously
sketching
all
the
parts
lightly
at
first
and
keeping
them
all
in
the
same
degree
of
finish
till
the
end
footnote
the
most
rational
way
to
paint
is
first
to
paint
all
the
large
masses
together
then
the
smaller
or
secondary
masses
and
finally
the
details
bringing
the
picture
forward
all
together
as
nearly
as
possible
nevertheless
the
were
always
a
delightful
break
in
our
week
occupation
and
i
remember
with
pleasure
the
walk
in
the
morning
down
to
the
house
two
days
in
the
week
and
the
happy
hour
of
messing
with
that
followed
it
in
those
days
of
blissful
ignorance
i
had
of
course
no
conception
of
the
difficulties
of
art
and
was
making
that
delusively
rapid
apparent
progress
which
is
so
very
encouraging
to
all
incipient
amateurs
not
a
single
study
of
those
times
remains
in
my
portfolios
and
i
know
not
what
may
have
become
of
them
this
is
the
more
to
be
regretted
that
in
the
fine
weather
our
master
took
us
into
the
fields
round
doncaster
and
taught
us
to
sketch
from
nature
which
we
accomplished
in
a
rudimentary
way
my
dear
wise
and
excellent
guardian
was
always
anxious
that
i
should
receive
as
good
an
education
as
my
opportunities
would
permit
so
she
insisted
on
my
learning
french
and
had
herself
taught
me
the
elements
of
that
language
which
she
was
able
to
read
though
she
did
not
pretend
to
speak
it
on
going
to
doncaster
i
found
latin
and
greek
so
serious
a
business
that
i
wanted
to
lighten
my
burdens
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
going
on
with
french
but
my
guardian
who
with
all
her
exquisite
gentleness
had
a
very
strong
will
would
not
hear
of
any
such
abandonment
and
wrote
very
determinedly
on
the
subject
both
to
me
and
to
cape
it
is
extremely
probable
that
this
exercise
of
my
guardian
will
may
have
had
a
great
influence
on
my
future
life
as
without
some
early
knowledge
of
french
i
might
not
have
felt
tempted
to
pursue
the
study
later
and
if
i
had
never
spoken
french
my
whole
existence
would
have
been
quite
different
our
french
master
at
doncaster
was
an
italian
of
good
family
named
testa
one
of
the
most
perfect
gentlemen
i
ever
met
and
an
excellent
teacher
my
deepest
regret
about
him
now
is
that
i
did
not
learn
italian
with
him
also
then
or
afterwards
footnote
it
is
astonishing
how
many
chances
of
improvement
young
men
foolishly
allow
to
slip
by
them
it
would
have
been
quite
worth
while
after
i
became
a
free
agent
to
go
and
spend
six
months
or
more
at
doncaster
simply
to
read
italian
with
so
good
a
master
as
testa
i
learned
italian
later
in
life
and
with
a
far
inferior
master
signor
testa
was
a
tall
thin
man
of
rather
cold
and
stately
manners
with
a
noble
head
covered
with
curly
brown
hair
he
was
always
exquisitely
clean
and
orderly
both
about
his
person
and
the
books
and
things
that
belonged
to
him
in
his
rooms
where
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
almost
feminine
refinement
though
their
occupant
was
by
no
means
effeminate
in
his
thoughts
or
bearing
we
understood
that
he
had
left
italy
in
consequence
of
some
political
difficulty
and
we
knew
that
he
had
still
relations
there
one
day
as
we
were
engaged
with
our
lesson
at
his
lodgings
he
took
some
leaves
and
a
faded
flower
or
two
that
had
just
arrived
in
a
letter
from
italy
and
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
these
have
come
from
my
father
place
now
it
so
happened
that
the
eldest
boy
in
our
class
was
liable
to
fits
of
perfectly
uncontrollable
laughter
what
the
french
call
fou
and
as
the
reader
is
sure
to
know
if
he
has
ever
been
troubled
with
that
disease
himself
the
fit
very
often
comes
on
just
at
the
moment
when
the
patient
feels
that
he
is
called
upon
to
look
particularly
grave
this
is
what
happened
in
the
present
case
our
unlucky
was
tickled
with
something
in
testa
accent
or
manner
or
perhaps
as
he
was
an
english
boy
the
foreigner
tenderness
of
feeling
may
have
seemed
to
him
absurd
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
reason
his
face
became
convulsed
with
suppressed
laughter
which
burst
forth
at
last
uncontrollably
this
made
the
rest
of
us
laugh
too
not
at
poor
testa
but
at
our
unworthy
comrade
i
shall
never
forget
the
italian
gentleman
look
on
that
occasion
his
eyes
were
still
brimming
with
tears
but
he
laid
down
the
flattened
leaves
and
flowers
and
looked
at
us
all
round
with
an
expression
that
cut
me
at
least
to
the
quick
he
said
did
not
expect
you
to
be
so
i
longed
to
explain
but
did
not
find
words
at
the
moment
and
we
went
on
with
our
lesson
the
fact
was
that
testa
had
not
the
least
sense
of
humor
in
his
composition
and
so
he
could
not
understand
what
had
happened
a
humorous
man
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
boys
would
have
understood
the
attack
of
and
forgiven
it
but
then
a
humorous
man
would
have
thought
twice
before
appealing
to
a
set
of
english
boys
for
sympathy
with
the
feelings
of
an
exile
the
incident
certainly
increased
my
feelings
of
respect
for
signor
testa
and
made
me
try
to
please
him
the
french
lessons
were
very
agreeable
to
me
and
besides
duly
preparing
them
i
read
some
french
on
my
own
account
and
acquired
a
liking
for
the
language
that
has
remained
with
me
ever
since
if
the
reader
has
the
sound
notions
about
education
by
which
all
subjects
were
strictly
divided
into
the
two
classes
of
serious
and
frivolous
pursuits
he
will
already
have
suspicions
about
the
soundness
of
a
training
that
included
the
two
idle
accomplishments
of
drawing
and
french
and
what
will
he
say
i
wonder
when
music
is
added
to
the
list
my
initiation
into
music
took
place
in
the
following
manner
we
had
a
who
came
regularly
to
cape
house
to
prepare
us
to
shine
in
society
and
his
instrument
was
the
convenient
pocket
fiddle
or
kit
although
this
instrument
gives
forth
but
a
feeble
kind
of
music
i
was
far
more
enchanted
with
it
than
by
the
dancing
and
wrote
a
most
persuasive
letter
to
my
good
guardian
imploring
her
to
let
me
study
the
violin
those
were
the
happy
times
when
one
had
energy
for
everything
i
had
already
three
languages
on
hand
and
the
art
of
painting
in
besides
which
i
was
in
a
mathematical
school
where
boys
were
prepared
for
cambridge
footnote
doncaster
school
at
that
time
was
a
sort
of
little
nursery
for
cambridge
cape
was
a
cambridge
man
and
so
was
his
brother
the
able
master
of
peterborough
school
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
the
art
of
should
not
be
added
to
these
pursuits
my
guardian
before
consenting
prudently
wrote
to
cape
to
ask
if
this
new
accomplishment
would
not
interfere
too
much
with
other
matters
and
his
answer
was
in
these
words
the
lad
is
getting
on
well
enough
with
his
studies
so
if
he
wants
to
amuse
himself
a
little
by
scraping
catgut
even
let
him
scrape
away
it
will
be
seen
that
cape
did
not
assign
to
music
the
high
rank
in
education
which
has
been
attributed
to
it
by
some
famous
thinkers
in
ancient
and
modern
times
few
musical
sensations
experienced
during
my
whole
life
have
equalled
in
intensity
the
sensation
of
hearing
our
play
upon
a
violin
after
the
weak
and
thin
tones
that
our
ears
had
been
accustomed
to
by
his
kit
i
was
so
little
in
the
way
of
hearing
music
at
doncaster
that
the
richer
note
of
the
violin
seemed
musical
as
the
lyre
of
apollo
a
contrast
so
striking
made
me
more
passionately
eager
to
learn
but
i
was
informed
by
one
of
the
private
pupils
who
exercised
considerable
authority
over
the
younger
boys
that
although
i
might
study
the
violin
with
the
i
was
never
to
practise
it
by
myself
this
restriction
was
pardonable
in
one
who
might
reasonably
dread
the
torturing
attempts
of
a
beginner
but
it
was
certainly
not
favorable
to
my
progress
however
in
course
of
time
it
came
to
be
relaxed
that
is
as
soon
as
i
could
play
tunes
it
is
very
odd
that
any
one
who
dislikes
dancing
as
heartily
as
i
have
always
disliked
it
in
manhood
should
have
been
rather
a
brilliant
performer
when
a
boy
our
was
extremely
pleased
with
me
and
encouraged
me
by
many
compliments
nay
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
teach
me
a
sailor
hornpipe
which
i
danced
in
public
as
a
when
the
school
gave
a
theatrical
entertainment
on
the
approach
of
the
christmas
holidays
all
this
is
simply
inconceivable
now
for
there
is
nothing
which
bores
me
so
thoroughly
as
a
ball
and
i
would
at
any
time
travel
fifty
miles
to
avoid
one
at
school
the
principal
amusement
was
cricket
for
which
i
soon
acquired
an
intense
aversion
all
games
bore
me
except
chess
and
billiards
and
it
was
especially
hard
to
be
compelled
to
field
out
to
please
the
elder
boys
and
so
waste
the
precious
holiday
afternoons
our
cricket
ground
was
on
the
racecourse
and
when
i
could
get
away
i
did
so
most
joyfully
and
betook
myself
to
a
quiet
place
amongst
the
furze
nearer
to
the
red
house
than
the
grand
stand
there
my
great
delight
was
to
read
poems
which
i
possessed
in
pocket
volumes
the
same
volumes
are
in
my
study
now
and
simply
to
handle
them
is
enough
to
bring
back
many
sensations
of
boyhood
of
all
the
influences
that
had
sway
over
me
in
those
days
and
for
long
afterwards
the
influence
of
scott
was
by
far
the
strongest
a
boy
can
not
make
a
better
choice
scott
has
the
immense
advantage
over
dull
authors
of
being
almost
always
interesting
and
the
equally
great
advantage
over
many
exciting
authors
that
he
never
leaves
an
unhealthy
feeling
in
the
mind
i
began
with
the
lady
of
the
lake
then
read
marmion
and
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
and
the
ballads
and
finally
rokeby
these
were
in
separate
small
volumes
which
gave
me
a
desire
to
possess
other
authors
in
the
same
convenient
form
so
i
added
goldsmith
crabbe
kirke
white
and
moore
irish
melodies
a
prize
for
history
gave
me
paradise
lost
in
two
volumes
of
my
favorite
size
and
two
who
saw
that
i
had
a
taste
for
such
volumes
kindly
gave
me
others
during
the
holidays
my
guardian
authorized
the
purchase
of
a
shakespeare
in
seven
pocket
volumes
and
the
spectator
in
eight
so
i
had
quite
a
little
library
which
became
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
it
is
very
remarkable
that
for
a
long
time
i
knew
scott
thoroughly
as
a
poet
without
having
read
a
single
novel
by
him
having
been
invited
by
one
of
my
to
a
country
house
not
very
far
from
doncaster
i
was
asked
by
the
lady
of
the
house
what
authors
i
had
read
and
on
mentioning
scott
poems
was
told
that
he
was
greater
as
a
novelist
than
as
a
poet
and
that
the
waverley
novels
were
certainly
his
finest
works
this
seemed
incredible
to
me
then
the
poems
being
so
delightful
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
surpassed
on
another
occasion
i
happened
to
be
standing
with
cape
in
the
little
chapel
at
conisborough
castle
and
having
heard
from
an
older
that
athelstane
had
died
there
i
asked
cape
if
it
was
true
yes
he
answered
if
you
believe
sir
walter
scott
not
having
read
ivanhoe
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
athelstane
in
question
was
an
historical
personage
nothing
in
the
retrospect
of
life
strikes
me
as
more
astonishing
than
the
rapid
mental
growth
that
must
have
taken
place
between
the
date
of
my
father
death
and
its
second
or
third
anniversary
when
my
father
died
i
was
simply
a
child
though
rather
a
precocious
one
as
the
journal
in
wales
testifies
but
between
two
and
three
years
after
that
event
the
child
had
become
a
boy
with
a
keen
taste
for
literature
which
if
it
had
been
taken
advantage
of
by
his
teachers
ought
to
have
made
his
education
a
more
complete
success
than
it
ever
became
the
misfortune
was
that
the
classics
were
not
taught
as
literature
at
all
but
as
exercises
in
grammar
and
prosody
they
were
dissected
by
teachers
who
were
simply
lecturers
on
the
science
of
language
and
who
had
not
large
views
even
about
that
our
whole
attention
being
directed
to
the
technicalities
of
the
pedagogue
we
did
not
perceive
that
the
classic
authors
had
produced
poems
which
as
literature
were
not
inferior
to
those
of
our
best
english
poets
so
it
happened
that
those
of
us
who
had
literary
tastes
were
content
to
satisfy
them
in
reading
english
authors
and
left
them
as
it
were
at
the
door
of
the
classroom
i
worked
courageously
enough
at
the
latin
books
which
were
set
before
me
but
never
found
the
slightest
enjoyment
in
them
indeed
it
was
only
much
later
and
through
the
medium
of
french
and
italian
that
i
gained
some
partial
access
to
the
literary
beauty
of
latin
as
for
greek
i
began
it
vigorously
at
doncaster
but
i
did
not
get
beyond
the
rudiments
during
my
stay
there
chapter
viii
early
attempts
in
english
advantages
of
life
at
a
school
story
of
a
my
schoolfellow
henry
his
remarkable
other
schoolfellows
story
of
a
a
swimming
our
walks
and
battles
the
love
of
literature
was
naturally
followed
by
some
early
attempts
at
versification
in
english
which
is
generally
looked
upon
as
a
silly
waste
of
time
in
a
boy
though
if
he
writes
latin
verses
which
we
were
taught
to
do
he
is
thought
to
be
seriously
occupied
prom
the
age
of
eleven
to
that
of
i
wrote
english
verses
very
frequently
and
am
now
very
glad
i
did
so
being
quite
convinced
that
it
was
a
most
profitable
exercise
in
the
language
my
early
verses
were
invariably
echoes
of
my
dearly
beloved
sir
walter
scott
a
master
whom
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
imitate
so
far
as
mere
versification
is
concerned
one
little
incident
about
this
early
is
worth
mentioning
in
this
place
i
was
staying
for
a
few
days
with
a
at
a
house
near
doncaster
when
i
dreamed
a
new
ballad
about
a
shipwreck
and
on
awaking
wrote
it
down
at
once
the
thing
would
not
be
worth
quoting
if
it
were
possible
to
remember
it
but
it
was
correct
enough
in
rhymes
and
metre
my
life
at
doncaster
was
not
on
the
whole
unhappy
and
the
steady
discipline
of
the
school
was
doing
me
much
good
cape
was
a
very
severe
master
and
he
used
the
cane
very
freely
but
to
a
boy
who
had
lived
under
the
tyranny
of
my
father
cape
severity
seemed
a
light
affliction
he
kept
up
his
dignity
by
seldom
appearing
in
the
schoolroom
he
sat
in
his
library
or
in
the
in
a
large
holding
a
book
in
one
hand
whilst
the
other
was
always
ready
to
clasp
the
cane
that
he
kept
close
by
any
failure
of
memory
would
cause
him
to
dart
a
severe
look
at
the
delinquent
a
false
quantity
made
him
scowl
and
when
he
suspected
real
carelessness
the
cane
was
resorted
to
at
once
unfortunately
he
could
not
apply
it
and
keep
his
temper
at
the
same
time
the
exercise
roused
him
to
fury
and
a
punishment
which
in
his
first
intention
was
to
have
been
mild
became
cruel
through
the
effect
of
his
own
rapidly
increasing
irritation
cape
health
was
not
good
and
no
doubt
this
added
to
the
natural
irritability
of
his
temper
there
was
one
unfortunate
youngster
whose
hands
were
covered
with
chilblains
and
who
was
constantly
displeasing
cape
by
inattention
or
inaccuracy
so
he
incurred
such
perpetual
canings
that
his
hands
were
pitiable
to
see
and
must
have
been
extremely
painful
our
was
no
doubt
laudably
or
selfishly
anxious
that
we
should
get
on
with
our
work
so
as
to
do
him
credit
at
cambridge
where
most
of
us
were
expected
to
go
but
he
seemed
almost
incapable
of
pity
i
remember
having
the
intense
pleasure
of
playing
him
a
little
trick
just
after
he
had
been
caning
a
lad
who
was
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
it
happened
in
this
way
but
first
i
must
describe
the
topography
of
the
place
cape
house
was
a
tall
brick
building
that
looked
upon
the
street
on
one
side
and
on
our
playground
which
had
formerly
been
a
garden
on
the
other
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
was
a
with
the
schoolroom
over
it
and
in
the
there
was
a
large
copper
for
boiling
linen
in
the
house
the
looked
over
the
and
it
somehow
happened
perhaps
it
was
in
the
easter
holidays
that
there
were
no
pupils
left
in
the
place
but
my
friend
brokenribs
and
i
footnote
we
always
called
him
brokenribs
which
recalled
his
real
name
by
a
sort
of
imitation
besides
which
though
his
ribs
had
not
actually
been
broken
he
had
suffered
from
a
good
many
bruises
cape
called
him
up
into
the
after
dark
and
began
to
thrash
him
brokenribs
after
some
time
began
to
think
that
a
sufficient
number
of
strokes
had
been
administered
and
put
the
between
himself
and
his
adversary
who
could
not
get
at
him
any
longer
i
was
in
the
playground
and
understood
all
that
was
passing
by
the
shadows
on
the
it
was
most
amusing
to
me
as
a
spectator
to
see
the
shadow
of
brokenribs
flit
rapidly
past
and
still
better
perhaps
to
see
it
followed
by
that
of
cape
with
bald
head
and
uplifted
cane
when
this
entertainment
had
lasted
some
time
i
heard
a
great
banging
of
doors
and
brokenribs
issued
from
the
house
rushing
like
a
hunted
deer
the
whole
length
of
the
playground
cape
after
me
he
said
where
shall
i
hide
in
the
copper
i
answered
with
a
sudden
inspiration
and
ran
into
the
with
him
where
i
lifted
the
lid
and
stowed
him
away
in
safety
the
lid
had
but
just
been
replaced
when
cape
appeared
in
the
playground
and
asked
if
i
had
seen
brokenribs
yes
sir
certainly
he
was
running
this
way
sir
i
accompanied
cape
into
the
which
had
an
outer
door
giving
access
to
a
lane
and
observed
with
pleasure
that
he
was
forced
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
brokenribs
had
taken
flight
the
lad
parents
lived
at
an
accessible
distance
perhaps
twenty
miles
so
cape
was
tormented
with
the
unpleasant
idea
that
the
lad
had
gone
home
to
tell
his
own
story
he
therefore
ordered
a
gig
and
drove
off
so
as
to
catch
brokenribs
during
his
flight
as
my
friend
had
been
sitting
in
cold
water
i
got
him
out
when
the
coast
was
clear
and
made
him
go
to
bed
where
the
housekeeper
sent
him
a
treacle
posset
after
driving
many
a
mile
in
vain
cape
returned
very
late
and
never
said
a
word
on
the
subject
to
either
of
us
poor
brokenribs
was
not
only
very
often
caned
but
he
was
fag
to
a
tyrannical
private
pupil
who
made
him
suffer
severely
the
private
pupils
upheld
the
sacred
institution
of
fagging
which
gave
them
a
pleasant
sense
of
authority
and
as
they
sat
like
gods
above
us
they
were
not
in
danger
of
retaliation
brokenribs
was
fag
to
a
young
man
who
determined
that
he
should
learn
two
things
first
to
endure
pain
without
flinching
and
secondly
to
smoke
tobacco
to
achieve
the
first
of
these
great
purposes
he
used
to
twist
the
lad
arms
and
administer
a
certain
number
of
hard
blows
upon
them
this
he
did
every
day
so
long
as
the
whim
lasted
as
for
the
smoking
poor
brokenribs
had
to
smoke
a
certain
number
of
pipes
every
day
a
single
pipe
made
him
look
ghastly
and
the
whole
series
made
him
dreadfully
ill
i
remember
his
white
face
at
such
times
but
he
attained
his
reward
in
becoming
an
accomplished
and
precocious
smoker
i
was
fag
myself
at
one
time
to
a
private
pupil
but
he
was
not
very
tyrannical
with
me
and
only
ordered
me
to
light
fires
which
was
a
valuable
element
in
my
education
it
gives
one
a
fine
independence
of
servants
to
be
able
to
light
a
fire
quickly
and
well
this
accomplishment
enables
a
man
to
get
up
as
early
as
he
chooses
even
in
winter
and
i
have
never
forgotten
it
indeed
i
lighted
a
fire
an
hour
before
writing
this
page
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
wise
to
teach
every
boy
the
art
of
doing
without
servants
on
occasion
the
private
pupils
exercised
authority
in
other
ways
than
by
converting
us
into
fags
it
so
happened
that
i
became
possessor
of
an
unfortunate
tawny
dog
how
one
boy
should
be
owner
of
a
dog
at
school
when
the
others
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
may
be
difficult
to
understand
and
indeed
my
ownership
did
not
last
for
very
long
but
it
was
pleasant
to
me
whilst
it
lasted
the
poor
beast
if
i
remember
rightly
belonged
to
somebody
who
did
not
want
him
and
was
going
to
have
him
slain
i
had
always
an
intense
affection
for
dogs
and
begged
cape
to
let
me
keep
this
one
promising
that
it
should
not
be
a
nuisance
i
was
rather
a
favorite
with
the
so
he
granted
this
very
extraordinary
request
and
it
was
understood
that
the
dog
was
to
lodge
in
a
box
in
the
i
bought
some
fresh
straw
for
him
and
took
the
greatest
care
of
him
so
that
he
soon
became
strongly
attached
to
me
had
there
been
no
private
pupils
the
creature
would
have
been
safe
enough
as
i
would
have
fought
any
lad
of
my
own
age
in
his
behalf
and
brokenribs
who
was
older
would
have
fought
the
bigger
boys
but
we
none
of
us
dared
to
resist
the
privates
who
were
grown
men
one
of
the
privates
thought
that
a
small
boy
ought
not
to
possess
a
dog
and
began
to
affirm
that
the
animal
was
a
nuisance
he
then
said
it
would
be
an
improvement
to
cut
off
its
tail
which
he
did
accordingly
in
spite
of
all
my
remonstrances
i
pitied
the
poor
beast
when
it
lay
suffering
with
its
bleeding
stump
and
did
all
that
affection
could
suggest
for
its
consolation
but
shortly
afterwards
the
same
private
pupil
who
had
a
taste
for
thought
it
would
be
good
fun
to
shoot
at
a
living
target
so
he
took
my
dog
away
into
a
field
and
shot
him
there
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
had
no
power
to
prevent
it
as
he
had
begun
by
persuading
cape
that
the
poor
beast
was
a
nuisance
which
he
certainly
was
not
he
was
a
very
quiet
timid
dog
of
an
anxious
apprehensive
temperament
having
probably
never
had
reason
to
place
much
trust
in
the
human
species
there
was
one
lad
at
the
school
who
was
a
coarse
bully
and
i
remember
his
playing
a
trick
on
me
which
was
nothing
less
than
pure
brigandage
he
ordered
me
to
give
him
my
keys
and
rummaged
in
my
private
box
he
found
a
small
telescope
in
it
which
was
to
his
liking
and
took
it
i
never
got
any
redress
about
that
telescope
as
the
bully
coolly
said
it
had
always
belonged
to
him
and
he
was
powerful
enough
to
act
on
the
great
principle
that
force
prime
le
it
is
most
astonishing
how
some
boys
gain
a
great
ascendency
over
others
when
there
seems
to
be
no
substantial
reason
for
it
one
of
my
who
was
cousin
to
some
of
my
cousins
and
bore
my
surname
as
one
of
his
christian
names
had
quite
a
remarkable
ascendency
over
boys
and
yet
he
had
not
the
physical
size
and
strength
which
usually
impose
upon
them
he
was
slight
and
small
though
he
had
a
handsome
face
but
he
had
an
aristocratic
temperament
which
inspired
a
sort
of
respect
and
a
governing
disposition
which
made
other
boys
yield
to
him
nothing
was
more
curious
than
to
see
how
completely
the
bully
effaced
himself
before
that
young
gentleman
superiority
the
bully
was
also
a
snob
and
probably
believed
that
henry
alexander
belonged
to
the
highest
aristocracy
he
was
well
descended
and
well
connected
there
was
an
abeyant
peerage
in
his
family
but
in
point
of
fact
his
social
position
was
not
better
than
that
of
some
other
boys
in
the
school
i
remember
well
the
intense
astonishment
of
the
bully
when
he
found
out
one
day
that
alexander
bore
my
name
as
a
christian
name
and
learned
the
reason
alexander
was
a
perfect
little
dandy
being
at
all
times
exceptionally
well
dressed
for
a
schoolboy
and
on
sundays
he
came
out
with
remarkable
splendor
in
spring
and
summer
he
wore
a
jacket
and
trousers
of
the
most
fashionable
cut
and
of
the
very
finest
blue
cloth
with
a
gloss
upon
it
and
a
white
waistcoat
adorned
with
a
bunch
of
valuable
trinkets
to
his
his
hat
his
gloves
his
wonderfully
small
boots
were
all
the
pink
of
perfection
he
smoked
very
good
cigars
and
talked
about
life
with
an
air
of
the
most
consummate
experience
that
gained
him
profound
respect
most
boys
hesitate
about
the
choice
of
a
profession
but
alexander
had
no
such
indecision
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
an
officer
with
his
father
consent
and
guided
by
a
sure
instinct
as
he
had
exactly
the
qualities
to
make
himself
respected
in
a
regiment
it
does
a
young
officer
no
harm
to
be
rather
a
dandy
and
to
shine
in
society
whilst
the
extreme
decision
and
promptitude
of
alexander
peremptory
will
and
the
natural
ease
with
which
he
assumed
authority
would
be
most
useful
in
command
a
few
years
later
he
joined
the
regiment
and
went
to
india
where
in
spite
of
his
rather
delicate
frame
he
became
an
active
sportsman
one
day
however
the
surgeon
of
the
regiment
saw
him
by
accident
in
his
bath
and
declared
that
he
was
too
thin
to
be
well
so
he
examined
him
and
found
that
consumption
had
begun
alexander
returned
to
england
where
he
lingered
a
few
months
and
then
died
he
came
to
see
me
not
very
long
before
his
death
not
looking
nearly
so
ill
as
i
had
expected
but
the
doctor
knew
best
with
better
health
he
might
have
had
a
brilliant
career
and
was
certain
at
least
to
be
an
efficient
and
popular
officer
with
the
right
degree
of
love
for
his
profession
another
of
my
who
died
early
was
the
eldest
son
and
heir
of
a
country
squire
and
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
able
young
men
i
ever
met
he
was
a
private
pupil
yet
not
at
all
disliked
by
the
younger
boys
as
he
was
always
kind
and
friendly
towards
us
there
was
a
project
for
his
going
out
to
india
and
he
talked
over
the
matter
with
his
father
one
evening
at
his
own
home
a
dispute
arose
between
father
and
son
as
they
sat
talking
late
and
when
they
separated
for
the
night
they
were
not
on
good
terms
the
next
morning
the
young
gentleman
was
found
dead
in
bed
under
circumstances
which
led
to
a
very
strong
suspicion
of
suicide
we
were
all
deeply
grieved
by
his
death
as
he
seemed
to
have
the
best
gifts
of
nature
and
life
was
opening
so
brightly
before
him
but
he
had
a
very
high
spirit
and
if
he
really
did
commit
suicide
which
is
not
improbable
it
is
very
likely
that
his
pride
had
been
wounded
whenever
i
read
in
the
poets
or
elsewhere
of
gifted
young
men
who
have
ended
sadly
and
prematurely
his
image
rises
before
me
though
it
is
now
forty
years
since
we
met
poor
brokenribs
is
gone
too
though
he
lived
long
enough
to
be
a
clergyman
for
some
years
he
was
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
bearing
all
his
hardships
with
admirable
equanimity
before
quitting
the
history
of
my
i
ought
perhaps
to
tell
the
story
of
a
great
swimming
exploit
whereof
i
was
the
hero
the
reader
after
this
expression
will
count
upon
some
display
of
prowess
and
of
vanity
at
the
same
time
but
there
is
neither
in
this
case
after
i
had
been
at
doncaster
about
a
year
one
of
the
private
pupils
came
to
me
one
day
with
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
said
we
are
going
to
buy
a
boat
at
cambridge
will
you
subscribe
now
it
so
happened
that
i
was
born
a
boating
creature
just
as
decidedly
as
i
was
born
to
be
a
cricketing
creature
and
such
a
question
addressed
to
me
was
much
as
if
one
said
to
a
young
duck
would
you
like
to
go
on
the
pond
or
would
you
prefer
being
shut
up
in
a
cage
of
course
i
said
yes
at
once
and
wrote
an
artful
letter
to
my
dear
guardian
begging
for
the
four
guineas
which
were
to
constitute
me
a
shareholder
in
the
expected
vessel
the
future
captain
of
the
boat
took
my
money
very
readily
when
it
came
and
nobody
could
have
felt
more
certain
of
a
boating
career
than
i
did
but
just
before
the
arrival
of
the
vessel
itself
it
occurred
to
cape
rather
late
in
the
day
that
he
would
take
a
prudent
precaution
so
he
issued
a
ukase
to
the
effect
that
none
but
good
swimmers
were
to
make
any
use
of
the
boat
now
i
had
often
heard
and
read
too
in
books
that
man
was
naturally
a
swimming
animal
and
that
any
one
who
was
thrown
into
water
would
swim
if
only
he
was
not
afraid
so
i
said
inwardly
it
is
true
that
i
never
swim
but
that
is
probably
because
i
have
only
bathed
in
shallow
water
i
have
courage
enough
and
if
they
pitch
me
into
the
river
don
most
probably
i
shall
swim
as
man
is
naturally
a
swimming
animal
and
fear
is
the
only
impediment
one
day
at
dinner
cape
asked
all
the
subscribers
one
after
another
if
they
could
swim
there
was
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
who
was
a
splendid
swimmer
and
well
known
for
such
both
to
the
masters
and
his
but
cape
did
not
omit
him
and
i
envied
the
simple
ease
of
his
yes
sir
when
it
came
to
me
i
too
said
yes
sir
affecting
the
same
ease
and
cape
looked
at
me
and
the
looked
at
me
and
every
one
of
the
fellows
looked
at
me
and
then
a
slight
smile
was
visible
on
all
their
countenances
after
dinner
the
fine
swimmer
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
not
known
sooner
about
my
possession
of
this
accomplishment
as
we
might
have
enjoyed
it
together
in
the
don
the
next
saturday
afternoon
was
fine
so
the
swimmers
went
to
the
river
with
the
and
i
was
very
politely
invited
to
accompany
them
on
this
an
older
boy
who
had
always
been
kind
to
me
said
privately
you
ca
swim
i
know
you
ca
and
you
better
confess
it
for
if
you
do
you
run
a
good
chance
of
being
drowned
this
afternoon
the
water
is
thirty
feet
deep
i
answered
with
cold
thanks
that
my
friend
apprehensions
were
groundless
and
we
set
off
on
our
way
to
the
river
the
unpleasant
reflection
occurred
to
my
mind
that
possibly
the
books
and
the
people
might
be
wrong
and
that
mere
courage
might
enable
me
to
dispense
with
acquired
skill
footnote
the
doctrine
that
courage
is
enough
is
most
mischievous
and
perilous
nonsense
i
have
become
a
good
swimmer
since
those
days
and
have
taught
my
sons
but
we
had
to
learn
it
as
an
art
just
as
one
learns
to
skate
but
i
put
away
this
idea
as
too
disagreeable
to
be
dwelt
upon
unfortunately
the
disagreeable
idea
that
we
set
aside
is
often
the
true
and
the
wise
one
as
we
went
through
the
town
to
the
water
the
boy
who
had
expressed
his
scepticism
disappeared
for
a
moment
in
a
shop
and
soon
emerged
with
a
long
and
strong
cord
over
his
shoulder
i
guessed
what
that
was
for
and
felt
humiliated
but
said
nothing
the
swimmers
stripped
and
plunged
but
just
at
the
moment
when
i
was
going
to
plunge
too
i
felt
the
strong
hand
of
the
on
my
shoulder
and
he
said
wait
one
moment
the
moment
was
employed
by
my
in
fastening
the
cord
round
my
waist
now
plunge
as
much
as
you
like
i
was
soon
in
the
depths
and
struggling
to
get
to
the
surface
but
somehow
did
swim
my
preserver
on
the
bank
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
convince
me
of
my
inability
by
a
prolonged
immersion
so
he
let
me
feel
the
unpleasant
beginning
of
drowning
they
say
that
the
sensation
is
delightful
at
a
later
stage
and
that
the
patient
dreams
he
is
walking
in
flowery
meadows
on
the
land
the
first
stage
is
undoubtedly
disagreeable
the
oppression
the
desire
to
breathe
are
horrible
but
i
did
not
get
so
far
as
to
fill
the
lungs
with
water
just
in
proper
time
there
came
a
great
tug
at
the
cord
and
i
was
fished
up
i
dressed
and
felt
very
small
looking
with
envy
on
the
real
swimmers
and
especially
at
the
fat
usher
who
was
rolling
about
like
a
porpoise
in
the
middle
of
the
river
the
boat
came
and
i
was
allowed
only
to
see
her
from
the
bank
how
lovely
she
looked
with
her
outside
varnish
and
her
internal
coat
of
cambridge
blue
how
beautiful
were
the
light
and
elegant
oars
that
i
was
forbidden
to
touch
some
time
after
that
one
of
my
said
you
know
hamerton
you
just
as
well
out
of
that
boat
as
in
her
for
whenever
we
want
to
go
out
on
wednesday
or
saturday
afternoons
we
always
find
that
the
privates
have
got
the
start
of
us
the
fact
is
the
boat
is
as
if
she
belonged
to
them
in
a
word
the
private
pupils
looked
on
the
aspirations
of
the
others
with
marked
disapproval
there
ought
of
course
to
have
been
a
plurality
of
boats
but
cape
was
not
himself
a
boating
man
and
did
not
encourage
the
amusement
he
dreaded
the
responsibility
for
accidents
one
result
of
my
adventure
was
a
firm
resolution
that
i
would
learn
to
swim
and
not
only
that
but
become
really
a
good
swimmer
i
never
attempted
anything
that
seemed
so
hopelessly
difficult
for
me
or
in
which
my
progress
was
so
slow
but
in
course
of
time
i
did
swim
and
many
years
afterwards
from
daily
practice
in
the
longer
and
warmer
summers
of
france
i
became
an
expert
able
to
read
a
book
aloud
in
deep
water
whilst
holding
it
up
with
both
hands
or
to
swim
with
all
my
clothes
on
and
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
using
one
hand
only
and
carrying
a
paddle
in
the
other
whilst
i
drew
a
small
boat
after
me
the
perseverance
that
led
to
this
ultimate
result
is
entirely
due
to
that
early
misadventure
at
doncaster
i
have
learned
one
or
two
other
things
in
consequence
of
being
stung
with
shame
in
a
like
manner
and
am
convinced
that
there
is
nothing
better
for
a
boy
than
to
be
roused
to
perseverance
in
that
way
i
never
felt
the
least
shame
however
in
not
being
able
to
play
cricket
in
a
manner
to
please
connoisseurs
i
hated
the
game
from
the
very
beginning
and
it
was
pure
slavery
to
me
and
i
never
had
the
faintest
desire
to
excel
in
it
or
even
to
learn
it
this
dislike
was
a
misfortune
as
not
to
love
cricket
is
a
cause
of
isolation
for
an
english
boy
a
kind
of
exercise
that
i
was
fond
of
was
ordinary
walking
we
often
took
long
walks
on
that
were
delightful
and
i
have
escaped
very
early
on
the
summer
mornings
and
taken
a
walk
round
the
being
back
in
time
for
the
usual
hour
of
rising
this
however
was
found
out
in
course
of
time
and
put
an
end
to
but
i
had
occasional
headaches
so
the
doctor
who
was
a
very
kind
friend
of
mine
and
invited
me
to
his
house
told
cape
that
he
must
send
me
out
for
a
walk
when
i
had
a
headache
but
how
am
i
to
know
that
his
head
really
aches
inquired
the
i
heard
the
reply
and
took
note
of
it
the
doctor
said
it
would
usually
be
accompanied
with
flushing
so
whenever
i
thought
i
was
sufficiently
red
in
the
face
i
applied
for
leave
to
go
to
the
the
doctor
had
a
son
who
was
a
pleasant
boy
about
my
own
age
there
never
was
the
slightest
between
us
but
quite
the
contrary
and
yet
we
fought
many
a
hard
battle
simply
because
the
elder
boys
backed
us
and
set
us
on
they
enjoyed
the
sport
as
they
would
have
enjoyed
though
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
as
it
was
not
quite
so
bloody
and
barbarous
this
fighting
was
of
no
practical
use
but
if
i
had
been
able
to
thrash
the
bully
who
took
my
telescope
would
have
been
of
some
use
unfortunately
he
was
my
senior
and
considerably
my
superior
in
strength
so
prudence
forbade
the
combat

his
death

the
time
of

life
at

i
was
extremely
religious

a
firm
belief
in

interferences
on
my
behalf
even
in
trifling
matters
such
as
being
asked
to
stay
from

to
monday
in
the
country
my
prayers
had
especial
reference
to
a
country
house
that
belonged
to
an
old
lady
who
was
grandmother
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
extended
a
sort
of
grandmotherly
kindness
to
myself
also

she
was
a
very
remarkable
and
peculiar
old
lady
the
house
was
very
large
but
she
would
only
use
a
few
small
rooms
she
never
would
travel
by
railway
but
made
long
journeys
as
well

ones

to
take
notes
of
the
sermons
and
write
them
out
afterwards
in
an
abridged
form
as
i
had
a
theological
turn
i
sometimes
inserted
passages
of
my
own
in
these
reports
which
made
the
masters
declare
that
they
did
not
remember
hearing
the
preacher
say
that
and

occasion
being
full

ideas

my

about
the
text
which
had
effectually
supplanted
those
of
the

sermon
which
cost
me
a
reprimand

excited

in
those
days
but
after
forty
years
i
may
be
excused
if
i
do
not
remember
much
about
what
he
preached
the
pulpit
was
arranged
in
the
three
stages
for
preacher
reader
and
clerk
and
on
one
occasion
the
highest
of
these
was
occupied
by
the
famous
wolff
the
missionary
to
bokhara
he
was
a
most
energetic
preacher
who
thumped
and
pushed
his
cushion
in
a
restless
way
so
that
at
last
he
fairly
pushed
it
off
its
desk
he
was
quick
enough
to
catch
it
by
the
tassel
but
he
did
not
catch
his
bible
which
fell
on
sharpe
head
or
shoulder
and
thence
to
the
floor
of
the
church
it
was
impossible
to
keep
quite
grave
under
the
circumstances
even
the
clergy
smiled
the
clerk
sought
refuge
in
fetching
the
fallen
volume
and
a
thrill
of
humorous
feeling
ran
through
the
congregation
cape
did
not
say
much
to
us
about
religion
he
read
prayers
every
morning
and
evening
and
once
or
twice
i
heard
him
preach
when
he
took
duty
in
a
village
church
not
far
from
the
famous
castle
of
conisborough
there
is
an
advantage
to
an
boy
in
being
with
a
quiet
like
cape
who
proposes
no
exciting
questions
i
came
under
a
very
different
influence
afterwards
which
plunged
me
into
the
stormy
ocean
of
theological
controversies
at
a
time
of
life
when
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
not
to
concern
myself
about
such
matters
the
religion
of
a
boy
should
be
quiet
and
practical
and
his
theology
should
be
as
simple
as
possible
and
quite
uncontroversial
in
its
temper
that
was
my
case
at
doncaster
i
was
a
very
firm
believer
but
simply
a
christian
not
belonging
to
any
party
in
the
church
of
england
and
hardly
indeed
in
any
but
an
accidental
way
to
the
church
of
england
herself
nothing
could
have
been
better
a
boy
is
not
answerable
for
the
doctrines
which
are
imposed
upon
him
by
his
elders
and
if
they
have
a
beneficial
effect
upon
his
conduct
he
need
not
whilst
he
remains
a
boy
trouble
himself
to
inquire
further
cape
health
was
gradually
failing
during
the
time
of
my
stay
at
doncaster
school
and
on
the
beginning
of
my
fourth
after
a
holiday
i
found
the
house
managed
by
his
sister
and
cape
himself
confined
to
his
room
with
hopeless
disease
very
shortly
afterwards
the
few
boys
who
had
come
were
sent
home
again
and
cape
died
his
sister
was
a
kind
old
maid
who
at
once
conceived
a
sort
of
affection
for
me
and
i
remember
that
when
i
left
she
gave
me
a
kiss
on
the
forehead
i
was
grieved
to
part
with
her
and
showed
some
real
sympathy
with
her
sorrow
about
her
dying
brother
i
felt
some
grief
on
my
own
account
for
cape
though
he
had
thrashed
me
many
a
time
with
his
cane
altogether
the
three
at
doncaster
had
been
well
spent
and
i
had
got
well
on
with
my
work
cape
brother
kept
a
good
school
at
peterborough
and
wanted
to
have
me
for
a
pupil
but
as
he
was
especially
strong
in
mathematics
and
prepared
young
men
for
cambridge
it
was
thought
that
as
i
was
to
go
to
oxford
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
study
under
an
oxford
man
i
never
had
the
slightest
natural
bent
for
mathematics
though
i
did
the
tasks
that
were
imposed
upon
me
in
a
perfunctory
manner
and
with
sufficient
accuracy
just
to
satisfy
my
masters
chapter

my

becomes
less
my

pursue

studies
at
dr
he
encourages
me
to
write
extract
from
a
prize
public
discussions
in
burnley
a
debate
on
queen
elizabeth
the
story
of
my
education
becomes
less
satisfactory
for
me
to
write
as
i
proceed
with
it
at
thirteen
i
was
a
boy
for
my
age
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
i
had
fallen
behind
and
if
i
have
now
any
claim
to
be
considered
a
fairly
man
it
is
due
to
efforts
made
since
youth
was
past
the
main
cause
of
this
retardation
may
be
told
before
proceeding
further
i
have
already
said
what
a
strong
affection
i
had
for
my
guardian
it
was
a
affection
as
she
was
one
of
the
noblest
and
best
women
who
ever
lived
and
all
my
gratitude
to
her
though
it
filled
my
heart
like
a
religion
was
not
half
what
she
deserved
or
what
my
maturer
judgment
now
feels
towards
her
memory
but
like
all
strong
affections
it
carried
its
own
penalty
along
with
it
about
the
time
of
cape
death
i
happened
to
be
staying
with
some
near
relations
and
one
of
them
made
a
casual
allusion
to
my
guardian
i
had
never
heard
of
this
and
was
inexpressibly
affected
by
the
news
my
informant
said
that
the
disease
was
absolutely
incurable
and
might
at
any
time
cause
sudden
death
this
was
unhappily
the
exact
truth
and
from
that
moment
i
looked
upon
my
dear
guardian
with
other
eyes
the
doctors
could
not
say
how
long
she
might
live
there
was
no
especial
immediate
danger
and
with
care
by
incurring
no
risks
her
life
might
be
prolonged
for
years
after
the
first
shock
produced
by
this
terrible
news
i
quickly
resolved
that
as
death
would
probably
soon
separate
us
and
might
separate
us
at
any
moment
i
would
keep
as
much
as
possible
near
my
guardian
during
her
life
she
may
have
been
tempted
to
keep
me
near
her
by
the
same
consideration
but
she
was
not
a
woman
to
allow
her
feelings
to
get
the
better
of
her
sense
of
duty
and
if
i
had
not
persistently
done
all
in
my
power
to
remain
at
burnley
she
would
have
sent
me
elsewhere
some
reviewer
will
say
that
these
are
trifling
matters
but
in
writing
a
biography
it
is
necessary
to
take
note
of
trifles
when
they
affect
the
whole
future
existence
of
the
subject
the
simple
fact
of
my
remaining
at
burnley
for
some
years
made
me
turn
out
an
indifferent
classical
scholar
but
at
the
time
left
my
mind
more
at
liberty
to
grow
in
its
own
way
it
is
time
to
give
some
account
of
butler
the
headmaster
of
burnley
grammar
school
who
now
became
my
master
and
some
time
afterwards
my
private
tutor
he
was
a
most
clergyman
and
a
good
scholar
but
his
too
great
tenderness
of
heart
made
him
not
exactly
the
kind
of
master
who
would
have
pushed
me
on
most
rapidly
i
had
a
great
affection
for
him
which
he
could
not
help
perceiving
and
this
completely
disarmed
him
so
that
he
never
could
find
in
his
heart
to
say
anything
disagreeable
to
me
and
on
the
contrary
would
often
caress
me
as
it
were
with
little
compliments
that
i
did
not
always
deserve
one
tendency
of
his
exactly
fell
in
with
my
own
tastes
he
did
not
think
that
education
should
be
confined
to
the
two
dead
languages
but
incited
the
boys
to
learn
french
and
german
and
even
chemistry
i
worked
at
french
regularly
german
i
learned
just
enough
to
read
one
thin
volume
and
went
no
further
footnote
i
resumed
german
many
years
afterwards
and
had
a
bavarian
for
my
master
but
he
was
unfortunately
obliged
to
go
back
to
his
own
country
and
i
stopped
again
having
many
other
things
to
do
all
my
literary
friends
who
know
german
say
it
is
of
great
use
to
them
but
i
never
felt
the
natural
taste
for
it
that
i
have
for
french
and
italian
as
for
the
chemistry
i
acquired
some
elementary
knowledge
which
afterwards
had
some
influence
in
directing
my
attention
to
etching
indeed
i
etched
my
first
plate
when
a
boy
at
burnley
school
it
was
a
portrait
of
a
jew
with
a
turban
and
was
frightfully
butler
he
had
not
received
his
degree
in
those
days
was
a
very
handsome
man
with
most
gentlemanly
manners
and
all
the
boys
respected
him
he
governed
the
school
far
more
by
his
own
dignity
than
by
any
severity
of
tone
he
always
wore
his
gown
in
school
and
had
a
desk
made
for
himself
which
rather
resembled
a
pulpit
and
was
ornamented
with
two
carved
crockets
that
of
the
who
also
wore
his
gown
being
destitute
of
these
ornaments
my
progress
in
classics
and
mathematics
was
now
not
nearly
so
rapid
as
it
had
been
under
the
severer
at
doncaster
but
butler
thought
he
discovered
in
me
some
sort
of
literary
gift
and
encouraged
me
to
write
english
essays
which
he
corrected
carefully
to
show
me
my
faults
of
style
this
was
really
good
as
butler
wrote
english
well
himself
and
was
a
man
of
cultivated
taste
he
even
encouraged
me
to
write
verses
a
practice
that
i
followed
almost
without
intermission
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
i
am
aware
that
there
are
many
very
wise
people
in
the
world
who
think
it
quite
rational
and
laudable
even
to
write
verses
in
the
latin
language
to
improve
their
knowledge
of
that
tongue
and
who
think
it
is
a
ridiculous
waste
of
time
to
do
the
same
thing
in
english
in
my
opinion
what
holds
good
for
one
language
holds
good
equally
for
another
and
i
no
more
regret
the
time
spent
on
english
versification
than
a
latin
scholar
would
regret
his
imitations
of
virgil
perhaps
the
reader
may
like
to
see
a
specimen
of
my
boyish
attempts
so
i
will
print
an
extract
from
one
a
poem
that
won
a
prize
at
burnley
school
in
the
year
the
subject
given
us
was
prince
charles
edward
after
the
battle
of
culloden
the
poem
begins
with
a
wild
galloping
flight
of
the
prince
from
the
battlefield
of
culloden
under
the
pale
moonlight
and
then
of
course
we
come
to
the
boat
voyage
with
flora
macdonald
here
my
love
of
boating
comes
in
the
lovely
lamp
of
heaven
shines
brightly
the
wave
cerulean
and
the
yellow
shore
as
those
waves
a
boat
like
flies
slender
and
frail
in
form
and
small
in
size
frail
though
it
be
is
manned
by
hearts
as
brave
as
have
tracked
the
pathless
ocean
wave
high
their
heads
celestial
diamonds
grace
the
jewelled
robe
of
night
and
luna
face
divinely
fair
o
goddess
of
the
night
guide
thou
their
bark
do
thou
their
pathway
light
like
rising
on
the
ocean
foam
or
like
the
petrel
on
its
stormy
home
yon
gallant
bark
speeds
joyously
along
the
wild
waves
roar
and
drown
the
boatmen
song
the
sails
kiss
the
welcome
wind
and
leave
the
screaming
far
behind
onward
they
fly
is
midnight
moonlit
hour
when
fairies
hold
their
court
and
sprites
have
power
and
now
is
morn
a
fair
isle
distant
strand
tempts
the
tired
fugitives
again
to
land
fiercely
repulsed
they
dare
once
more
the
wave
fired
with
undying
zeal
their
prince
to
save
and
when
night
flings
her
sable
mantle
the
giant
crags
where
idly
soar
they
unmolested
gain
the
land
and
soon
with
rapid
steps
bestride
the
strand
to
kingsburgh
noble
halls
the
path
they
gain
and
leave
afar
the
main
footnote
in
the
printed
copies
of
the
poem
the
age
of
the
writer
was
given
as
thirteen
but
i
was
only
in
my
thirteenth
year
very
likely
this
extract
will
be
as
much
as
the
reader
will
have
patience
for
i
think
the
verses
are
tolerably
good
for
a
boy
not
yet
thirteen
years
old
the
versification
is
perhaps
as
correct
as
that
of
most
prize
poems
and
there
is
some
go
in
the
poetry
it
can
not
however
lay
claim
to
much
originality
even
in
the
short
extract
just
given
i
see
the
influence
of
three
poets
virgil
scott
and
byron
the
best
that
can
be
expected
from
the
poetry
of
a
boy
is
that
he
should
give
evidence
of
a
liking
for
the
great
masters
and
in
my
case
the
liking
was
sincere
in
later
years
butler
made
me
translate
many
of
the
odes
of
horace
into
english
verse
i
did
that
work
with
pleasure
but
have
not
preserved
one
of
the
translations
i
have
said
that
he
also
encouraged
me
to
write
essays
he
always
gave
the
subject
and
criticized
my
performance
very
closely
i
wrote
so
many
of
these
essays
that
i
am
afraid
to
give
the
number
that
remains
in
my
memory
for
fear
of
unconscious
exaggeration
besides
these
exercises
we
had
public
discussions
in
the
school
on
historical
subjects
and
of
these
i
remember
a
great
one
on
the
character
of
queen
elizabeth
i
was
chosen
for
the
defence
and
the
attack
on
elizabeth
fame
was
to
be
made
by
the
captain
of
the
school
a
lad
of
remarkable
ability
named
edward
moore
who
was
greatly
my
superior
in
acquirements
it
happened
i
remember
that
my
guardian
was
staying
at
a
country
house
the
holme
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
whitaker
the
celebrated
historian
of
craven
whalley
and
richmondshire
and
this
learned
man
had
left
a
good
library
so
i
went
to
stay
a
few
days
to
read
up
the
subject
those
days
were
very
pleasant
to
me
the
house
is
very
beautiful
with
carved
oak
tapestry
mullioned
windows
old
portraits
and
stained
glass
and
just
the
surroundings
that
i
have
always
loved
and
it
nestled
quietly
in
an
open
space
in
the
bottom
of
a
beautiful
valley
between
steep
hills
with
miles
of
walks
in
the
woods
if
ever
i
have
been
in
danger
of
coveting
my
neighbor
house
it
has
been
there
when
we
came
to
the
debate
it
turned
out
that
my
materials
were
so
abundant
that
i
spoke
for
an
hour
and
a
half
moore
spoke
about
forty
minutes
and
made
a
most
telling
personal
hit
when
attacking
elizabeth
for
her
vanity
she
was
vain
of
her
complexion
vain
even
of
her
hair
here
the
orator
paused
and
looked
at
me
then
he
added
slowly
and
significantly
was
the
point
here
was
that
my
hair
was
red
in
those
days
though
it
has
darkened
since
i
need
not
add
that
the
allusion
was
understood
at
once
by
the
whole
school
and
was
immensely
successful
after
we
had
spoken
a
youth
rose
to
give
his
opinion
and
as
his
speech
was
sufficiently
laconic
i
will
repeat
it
the
effect
would
be
quite
spoiled
if
i
did
not
add
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
very
bad
cold
which
played
sad
havoc
with
his
consonants
this
was
his
speech
without
the
slightest
curtailment
id
by
opidiod
queed
elizabeth
was
to
be
blabed
because
she
was
a
proud
wobad
my
opponent
in
the
debate
on
elizabeth
was
i
believe
all
things
taken
into
consideration
the
most
gifted
youth
i
ever
knew
during
my
boyhood
he
kept
at
the
head
of
the
school
without
effort
as
if
the
post
belonged
to
him
and
he
was
remarkable
for
bodily
activity
being
the
best
swimmer
in
the
school
and
i
think
the
best
cricketer
also
he
afterwards
died
prematurely
and
his
brother
died
in
early
manhood
from
exhausting
fatigue
during
an
excursion
in
the
alps
the
school
was
in
those
days
attended
by
lads
belonging
to
all
classes
of
society
except
the
highest
aristocracy
of
the
neighborhood
and
it
did
a
good
deal
towards
keeping
up
a
friendly
feeling
between
different
classes
that
is
the
great
use
of
a
good
local
school
many
of
the
boys
were
the
sons
of
rich
men
who
could
easily
have
sent
them
to
public
schools
at
a
distance
and
perhaps
in
the
present
generation
they
would
do
so
chapter
xi
my
elder
we
go
to
live
at
description
of
the
my
strong
attachment
to
my
first
experiment
in
the
stream
at
my
first
similarity
of
my
life
at
hollins
to
my
life
in
france
years
later
my
elder
uncle
the
owner
of
my
grandfather
house
and
estate
at
hollins
had
been
educated
to
the
law
as
the
income
of
our
branch
of
the
family
was
insufficient
and
he
had
begun
to
practise
as
a
solicitor
in
burnley
where
at
that
time
there
was
an
excellent
opening
but
he
had
not
the
kind
of
tact
which
enables
lawyers
to
get
on
in
the
world
so
his
professional
income
diminished
and
he
went
to
live
in
halifax
and
let
the
house
at
hollins
his
family
was
large
and
for
some
years
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
live
according
to
his
rank
in
society
for
he
had
married
a
lady
of
good
family
they
had
quarterings
between
them
and
like
most
men
in
a
similar
position
he
was
unwilling
to
adopt
the
only
safe
plan
which
is
to
take
boldly
a
lower
place
on
the
ladder
at
halifax
he
lived
in
a
large
house
hopwood
hall
which
belonged
to
his
and
there
his
wife
and
he
received
the
halifax
society
of
those
days
at
what
i
believe
were
very
pleasant
entertainments
for
they
had
the
natural
gift
of
hospitality
and
lacked
nothing
but
a
large
fortune
to
be
perfect
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
my
uncle
was
living
in
retirement
at
scarborough
when
hollins
happened
to
fall
vacant
so
he
became
the
tenant
but
as
the
house
was
too
large
for
him
my
uncle
divided
it
into
two
and
proposed
to
let
the
other
half
to
my
guardian
and
her
sister
they
accepted
and
the
consequence
was
that
we
went
to
live
in
the
country
a
most
important
change
for
me
as
i
soon
acquired
that
passion
for
a
country
life
which
afterwards
became
a
second
nature
and
which
though
it
may
have
been
beneficial
to
my
health
and
perhaps
in
some
degree
to
the
quality
of
my
work
has
been
in
many
ways
an
all
but
fatal
hindrance
to
my
success
there
are
or
were
a
great
many
old
halls
in
lancashire
that
belonged
to
the
old
families
which
have
now
for
the
most
part
disappeared
they
were
of
all
sizes
some
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
wealthy
modern
country
gentleman
though
not
arranged
according
to
modern
ideas
and
others
of
quite
small
dimensions
though
generally
interesting
for
their
architecture
much
more
interesting
indeed
than
the
houses
which
have
succeeded
them
hollins
was
between
the
two
extremes
and
when
in
its
perfection
must
have
been
rather
a
good
specimen
with
its
mullioned
windows
its
numerous
gables
and
its
formal
front
garden
with
a
straight
avenue
beyond
unfortunately
my
grandfather
found
it
necessary
to
rebuild
the
front
and
in
doing
so
altered
the
character
by
introducing
modern
sash
windows
in
the
upper
story
and
though
he
retained
mullioned
windows
on
the
ground
floor
they
were
not
strictly
of
the
old
type
my
uncle
also
carried
out
other
alterations
external
and
internal
which
ended
by
depriving
the
house
of
much
of
its
old
character
and
still
more
recent
changes
have
gone
farther
in
the
same
direction
however
such
as
it
was
in
my
youth
the
place
inspired
in
me
one
of
those
intensely
strong
local
attachments
which
take
root
in
some
natures
and
in
none
i
really
believe
more
powerfully
than
in
mine
like
all
strong
passions
these
local
attachments
are
extremely
inconvenient
and
it
would
be
better
for
a
man
to
be
without
them
but
all
reasoning
on
such
subjects
is
superfluous
hollins
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
a
small
but
very
pretty
estate
almost
entirely
bounded
by
a
rocky
and
picturesque
and
so
pleasantly
varied
by
hill
and
dale
wood
meadow
and
pasture
that
it
appears
much
larger
than
it
really
is
in
my
boyhood
it
seemed
an
immensity
my
cousins
and
i
used
to
roam
about
it
and
play
at
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
with
great
satisfaction
to
ourselves
we
fished
and
bathed
in
one
of
the
pools
where
our
ships
delivered
real
broadsides
of
lead
from
their
little
cannons
these
boyish
recollections
and
an
early
passion
for
landscape
beauty
made
hollins
seem
a
kind
of
earthly
paradise
to
me
and
the
idea
of
going
to
live
there
instead
of
in
a
row
of
houses
in
a
manufacturing
town
filled
me
with
the
most
delightful
anticipations
my
uncle
put
workmen
in
the
house
to
prepare
it
and
on
every
opportunity
i
walked
there
to
see
what
they
were
doing
even
at
that
age
i
knew
much
more
about
architecture
than
my
elders
being
perfectly
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
old
halls
and
so
i
was
constantly
losing
temper
at
what
seemed
to
me
the
evident
stupidity
of
the
masons
there
was
an
old
who
did
not
like
me
and
my
criticisms
and
he
swore
at
me
freely
enough
in
an
explicit
lancashire
manner
one
day
simply
by
the
eye
i
perceived
that
he
was
four
inches
out
in
a
measurement
and
told
him
of
it
when
he
swore
frightfully
he
then
took
his
rule
and
finding
himself
in
the
wrong
swore
more
frightfully
than
ever
this
was
my
first
experience
in
the
thankless
business
of
and
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
false
position
in
which
i
often
found
myself
in
youth
from
knowing
more
about
some
subjects
than
is
usual
with
boys
the
small
estate
on
which
hollins
is
situated
is
divided
from
towneley
park
by
a
road
and
a
wall
and
on
the
opposite
side
its
boundary
for
most
of
the
distance
is
the
rocky
stream
that
has
been
already
mentioned
the
stream
had
a
great
influence
on
my
whole
life
by
giving
me
a
taste
for
the
beauty
of
wild
streams
in
scotland
and
elsewhere
it
is
called
the
brun
and
gives
its
name
to
burnley
the
rocks
are
a
sandstone
sufficiently
warm
in
color
to
give
a
very
pleasant
contrast
to
the
green
foliage
and
the
forms
of
them
are
so
broken
that
in
sunshine
there
are
plenty
of
fine
accidental
lights
and
shadows
it
was
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures
to
follow
the
course
of
this
stream
with
a
up
to
the
moors
where
it
flowed
through
a
wide
and
desolate
valley
or
hollow
in
the
hills
as
the
aspect
of
a
stream
is
continually
changing
with
the
seasons
and
the
quantity
of
water
it
is
always
new
the
only
regret
i
have
about
my
residence
near
the
brun
is
that
i
did
not
learn
at
the
right
time
to
make
the
most
of
it
in
the
way
of
artistic
study
but
i
did
as
much
perhaps
as
was
to
be
expected
from
a
boy
who
was
receiving
a
literary
and
not
an
artistic
education
the
defect
of
the
brun
was
the
absence
of
pools
big
enough
for
swimming
and
boating
but
it
gave
a
tantalizing
desire
for
these
pleasures
and
i
was
as
aquatic
as
my
opportunities
would
allow
in
june
my
first
catamaran
was
launched
on
a
i
built
it
myself
with
an
outlay
of
one
pound
for
the
materials
it
was
composed
of
two
floats
or
tubes
consisting
of
a
light
framework
of
deal
covered
with
waterproofed
canvas
these
were
kept
apart
in
the
water
but
joined
above
by
a
light
open
framework
that
served
as
a
deck
and
on
which
the
passengers
sat
the
thing
would
carry
five
people
and
was
propelled
by
short
oars
being
extremely
light
it
was
easily
drawn
on
a
road
and
was
provided
with
small
wheels
for
that
purpose
this
boyish
attempt
would
not
have
been
mentioned
had
it
not
been
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
practical
experiments
in
the
construction
of
catamarans
which
have
continued
down
to
the
date
of
the
present
writing
and
of
which
the
reader
will
hear
more
in
the
sequel
i
promise
to
endeavor
not
to
weary
him
with
the
subject
it
is
astonishing
how
very
in
their
effects
are
the
tastes
and
habits
that
we
acquire
in
early
life
the
sort
of
existence
that
i
am
leading
here
at
pr√©
charmoy
near
autun
in
this
year
bears
a
wonderfully
close
resemblance
to
my
existence
at
hollins
in
i
am
living
as
i
was
then
on
a
pretty
estate
with
woods
meadows
pastures
and
a
beautiful
stream
with
hills
visible
from
it
in
all
directions
there
is
a
too
about
a
mile
from
the
house
and
i
am
even
now
trying
catamaran
experiments
on
this
pond
as
i
did
on
the
other
in
lancashire
my
occupations
are
exactly
the
same
and
to
complete
the
resemblance
it
so
happens
that
just
now
i
am
reading
latin
the
chief
difference
is
that
writing
has
become
lucrative
and
professional
whereas
in
those
earlier
days
it
was
a
study
only
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
years
separate
me
from
a
time
so
like
the
present
in
many
ways
like
and
yet
unlike
for
i
was
then
in
lancashire
and
am
now
in
france
but
this
is
a
fact
that
i
only
realize
when
i
think
about
it
the
real
exile
for
me
would
be
to
live
in
a
large
town
chapter

interest

the
last
chapter
ended
by
saying
that
my
occupations
in
early
life
were
the
same
as
they
are
at
present
but
i
now
remember
one
or
two
points
of
difference
in
those
days
i
lived
mentally
a
great
deal
in
the
middle
ages
this
was
owing
to
the
influence
of
sir
walter
scott
certainly
of
all
authors
the
one
who
has
most
influenced
me
and
it
was
also
due
in
some
measure
to
a
romantic
interest
in
the
history
of
my
own
family
and
of
the
other
families
in
the
north
of
england
with
which
mine
had
been
connected
in
the
past
for
the
greeks
and
romans
i
cared
very
little
they
seemed
too
remote
from
my
own
country
and
race
and
the
english
present
in
which
my
lot
was
cast
seemed
too
dull
and
too
prosaic
and
commonplace
my
imagination
being
saturated
with
scott
i
had
naturally
the
same
taste
as
my
master
i
soon
learned
all
about
heraldry
and
in
my
leisure
time
drew
and
colored
all
the
coats
of
arms
that
had
been
borne
by
the
hamertons
in
their
numerous
alliances
as
well
as
the
arms
of
other
families
from
which
our
own
was
descended
i
wrote
characters
on
parchment
and
made
pedigrees
and
became
so
much
of
a
mediaevalist
that
there
was
considerable
risk
of
my
stopping
short
in
the
amateur
practice
of
such
arts
as
illumination
and
painting
on
glass
the
same
taste
for
the
middle
ages
led
me
to
imitate
our
forefathers
in
more
active
pursuits
amongst
others
i
had
such
a
passion
for
hawking
that
at
one
time
i
became
incapable
of
opening
my
lips
about
anything
else
my
guardian
said
it
was
hawk
hawk
hawking
from
morning
till
night
not
that
i
ever
possessed
a
living
falcon
of
any
species
whatever
my
uncle
resigned
to
me
a
corner
of
the
outbuildings
on
the
of
which
was
a
for
my
horse
and
above
it
a
room
that
i
set
apart
for
the
falcons
when
they
should
arrive
but
in
spite
of
many
promises
from
gamekeepers
and
naturalists
and
others
no
birds
ever
came
the
hoods
and
jesses
were
ready
very
prettily
adorned
with
red
morocco
leather
and
gold
thread
the
mews
were
ready
too
with
partitions
in
of
my
own
making
everything
was
ready
except
the
peregrines
i
knew
the
of
all
the
families
in
the
neighborhood
and
of
course
that
of
the
towneleys
who
had
a
chapel
in
burnley
church
for
the
interment
of
their
dead
adorned
with
many
hatchments
those
hatchments
had
a
double
interest
for
me
as
heraldry
in
the
first
place
and
also
because
the
towneleys
had
a
peregrine
falcon
for
their
crest
i
envied
them
that
crest
and
would
willingly
have
exchanged
for
it
our
own
greyhound
couchant
sable
burnley
school
possesses
a
library
which
is
rich
in
old
tomes
that
few
people
ever
read
in
my
youth
these
volumes
were
kept
in
a
room
entirely
surrounded
with
dark
oak
wainscot
that
opened
on
the
shelves
where
these
old
books
reposed
i
read
some
of
them
more
or
less
but
have
totally
forgotten
them
all
except
a
chaucer
that
volume
delighted
me
and
i
have
read
in
it
many
an
hour
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
i
had
not
the
same
affectionate
curiosity
about
the
greek
and
latin
classics
but
it
was
something
to
have
a
taste
for
the
literature
of
one
own
country
my
uncle
edward
alexander
of
halifax
was
a
lawyer
of
literary
and
antiquarian
tastes
and
a
great
lover
of
books
not
to
read
only
but
to
have
around
him
in
a
library
he
was
extremely
kind
to
me
and
now
when
i
know
better
how
very
rare
such
kindness
is
in
the
world
i
feel
perhaps
even
more
grateful
for
it
than
i
did
then
alexander
was
the
father
of
the
young
alexander
who
was
my
at
doncaster
and
i
am
hardly
exaggerating
his
affection
for
me
when
i
say
that
he
had
a
paternal
feeling
towards
myself
he
put
his
library
entirely
at
my
disposal
and
gave
me
a
room
in
his
house
at
heath
field
near
halifax
whenever
i
felt
inclined
to
avail
myself
of
it
and
had
liberty
to
go
there
his
library
had
cost
him
several
thousand
pounds
and
was
rich
in
archaeological
books
alexander
was
a
charming
lady
always
exquisitely
gentle
in
her
way
and
gifted
with
a
quiet
firmness
which
enabled
her
to
match
very
effectually
the
somewhat
irascible
disposition
of
my
friend
who
had
the
irritability
as
well
as
the
kindness
of
heart
which
i
have
since
observed
are
often
found
together
in
frenchmen
with
all
his
goodness
he
was
by
no
means
an
indulgent
judge
he
could
not
endure
the
slightest
failure
or
forgetfulness
in
good
manners
and
most
of
his
young
relations
were
afraid
of
him
i
only
offended
him
once
and
that
but
slightly
he
was
walking
in
his
own
garden
with
my
uncle
when
i
had
to
do
something
that
required
the
use
of
both
hands
and
i
was
encumbered
with
a
book
i
dared
not
lay
the
book
on
the
ground
as
i
should
have
done
if
it
had
been
my
own
so
i
asked
my
uncle
to
hold
it
i
could
see
an
expression
on
alexander
face
which
said
clearly
enough
that
i
had
taken
a
liberty
in
requesting
this
little
service
from
a
senior
and
it
only
occurred
to
me
as
an
afterthought
that
i
might
have
put
my
hat
on
the
ground
and
laid
the
book
on
the
hat
this
little
incident
shows
one
side
of
my
dear
friend
nature
but
it
was
not
at
all
a
bad
thing
for
me
to
be
occasionally
under
the
influence
of
one
who
was
at
the
same
time
kind
and
severe
in
early
life
he
had
been
a
dandy
and
a
local
poet
had
called
him
elegant
extracts
the
halifax
fop
footnote
elegant
extracts
was
the
title
of
a
book
of
miscellaneous
reading
which
had
an
extensive
sale
in
those
days
the
couplet
related
to
a
public
ball
elegant
extracts
the
halifax
fop
with
in
hand
took
coach
for
the
hop
alexander
sometimes
alluded
in
a
pleasant
way
to
his
early
foppishness
and
told
some
amusing
anecdotes
one
of
which
i
remember
he
and
a
young
friend
having
adopted
some
startling
new
fashion
before
anybody
else
in
halifax
were
going
to
church
very
proud
of
themselves
when
they
heard
a
girl
laughing
at
them
on
which
her
companion
rebuked
her
saying
you
should
laugh
you
might
be
struck
so
she
thought
the
dandies
were
two
misshapen
idiots
in
his
maturity
all
that
remained
of
early
dandyism
was
an
intolerance
of
every
kind
of
slovenliness
he
rigorously
exacted
order
in
his
library
i
might
use
any
of
his
books
but
must
put
them
all
back
in
their
places
perhaps
my
present
strong
love
of
order
may
be
due
in
a
great
measure
to
alexander
teaching
and
example
amongst
the
friends
of
my
youth
there
are
very
few
whom
i
look
back
to
with
such
grateful
affection
like
most
boys
who
have
become
authors
i
made
attempts
in
literary
composition
independently
of
those
which
were
directly
encouraged
by
my
master
in
this
way
i
wrote
a
number
of
articles
that
were
accepted
by
the
historic
times
a
london
illustrated
journal
of
those
days
which
was
started
under
the
patronage
of
the
church
of
england
but
had
not
a
great
success
my
first
articles
were
on
the
universities
of
which
i
knew
nothing
except
by
hearsay
and
on
civilization
ancient
and
modern
which
was
rather
a
vast
subject
for
a
boy
whose
reading
had
been
so
limited
however
the
editor
of
the
historic
times
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
my
age
so
i
favored
him
with
a
long
series
of
articles
on
rome
in
forming
altogether
as
complete
a
history
of
the
city
for
that
year
as
could
have
been
written
by
one
who
had
never
seen
it
who
did
not
know
italian
and
who
had
not
access
to
any
other
sources
of
information
than
those
which
are
accessible
to
everybody
in
the
newspapers
under
these
circumstances
it
may
seem
absurd
to
have
undertaken
such
a
task
but
the
reader
may
be
reminded
that
learned
historians
undertake
to
tell
us
what
happened
long
ago
from
much
less
ample
material
i
got
no
money
for
these
articles
there
were
twelve
of
them
and
no
publisher
would
reprint
them
because
there
was
no
personal
observation
in
them
which
publishers
always
expect
in
a
narrative
of
contemporary
events
the
work
had
however
been
a
good
exercise
for
me
in
the
digesting
and
setting
in
literary
order
of
a
mass
of
confused
material
my
passion
for
heraldry
and
hawking
led
to
the
production
of
a
little
book
on
heraldry
which
was
an
imitation
of
sir
john
observations
on
hawking
a
treatise
that
seemed
to
me
simple
and
clearly
arranged
my
little
book
had
no
literary
value
and
the
publisher
said
that
only
copies
were
sold
however
on
being
asked
to
produce
the
remainder
of
the
edition
he
said
he
was
unable
to
do
so
as
the
copies
had
been
mislaid
the
printing
and
binding
having
been
done
at
my
expense
i
compelled
the
publisher
to
reprint
the
book
but
this
brought
me
no
pecuniary
benefit
as
the
demand
such
as
it
was
had
been
satisfied
by
the
first
edition
to
this
day
i
do
not
feel
certain
in
my
own
mind
whether
the
publisher
was
dishonest
or
not
it
would
be
quite
natural
that
a
book
on
heraldry
should
have
a
very
small
sale
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
inconceivable
that
more
than
four
hundred
copies
of
a
book
should
have
been
simply
lost
footnote
there
is
a
third
possibility
the
sale
may
have
been
exactly
what
the
publisher
stated
but
he
may
have
had
no
belief
in
the
success
of
the
work
and
have
printed
only
one
hundred
copies
whilst
charging
me
for
five
hundred
it
was
a
very
good
thing
for
me
that
the
printing
of
this
treatise
on
heraldry
was
a
cause
of
loss
and
disappointment
for
if
it
had
been
successful
i
might
easily
have
wasted
my
life
in
archaeology
and
corrected
pedigrees
those
long
lists
of
dead
people
of
whom
nobody
knows
anything
but
their
names
and
the
estates
they
were
lucky
enough
to
possess
the
reader
will
see
that
up
to
this
point
my
tastes
had
been
conservative
and
aristocratic
then
there
came
a
revolution
which
was
the
most
important
intellectual
crisis
of
my
life
and
which
deserves
a
chapter
to
itself
chapter
xiii
political
and

with
german
the
inspiration
of
the
inquiry
into
foundation
for
the
i
cease
to
be
a
an
alternative
presents
a
provisional
condition
of
prolonged
our
medical
his
remarkable
his
opinions
all
my
relations
were
tories
of
the
most
strongly
conservative
type
and
earnestly
believing
members
of
the
church
of
england
more
inclined
to
the
evangelical
than
to
the
high
church
party
in
my
early
youth
i
naturally
took
the
religion
and
political
color
of
the
people
about
me
there
was
at
burnley
in
those
days
a
curate
who
has
since
become
a
clergyman
in
manchester
james
bardsley
he
was
a
man
of
very
strong
convictions
of
an
extreme
evangelical
kind
and
nature
had
endowed
him
with
all
the
gifts
of
eloquence
necessary
to
propagate
his
opinions
from
the
pulpit
footnote
since
then
he
has
become
canon
and
archdeacon
he
was
really
eloquent
and
he
possessed
in
a
singular
degree
the
wonderful
power
of
enchaining
the
attention
of
his
audience
we
always
listened
with
interest
to
what
bardsley
was
saying
at
the
moment
and
with
the
feeling
of
awakened
anticipation
as
he
invariably
conveyed
the
impression
that
something
still
more
interesting
was
to
follow
his
power
as
a
preacher
was
so
great
that
his
longest
sermons
were
not
felt
to
be
an
infliction
one
might
feel
tired
after
they
were
over
but
not
during
their
delivery
his
power
was
best
displayed
in
attack
and
he
was
very
aggressive
especially
against
the
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
which
he
declared
to
be
one
huge
lie
of
course
a
boy
of
my
age
believed
his
own
religion
to
be
absolutely
true
and
others
to
be
false
in
exact
proportion
to
their
divergence
from
it
as
this
is
the
way
with
young
people
when
they
really
believe
it
was
my
habit
to
take
an
intensely
strong
interest
in
anything
that
interested
me
at
all
and
as
religion
had
a
supreme
interest
for
me
i
read
all
about
the
protestant
controversy
with
rome
under
guidance
in
books
of
controversial
theology
recommended
by
him
my
guardian
with
her
usual
good
sense
did
not
quite
approve
of
this
controversial
spirit
she
was
content
to
be
a
good
christian
in
her
own
way
and
let
the
poor
roman
catholics
alone
but
i
was
too
ardent
in
what
seemed
to
me
the
cause
of
truth
to
see
with
indifference
the
menacing
revival
of
romanism
a
large
new
roman
catholic
church
was
erected
in
burnley
and
opened
with
an
imposing
ceremony
there
was
at
that
time
a
belief
that
the
power
of
the
pope
might
one
day
be
in
our
country
and
the
great
results
of
the
reformation
either
wholly
sacrificed
or
placed
in
the
greatest
jeopardy
protestants
were
called
upon
to
defend
these
conquests
and
in
order
to
qualify
themselves
for
this
great
duty
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
make
themselves
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
great
controversy
between
the
pure
church
to
which
it
was
their
own
happiness
to
belong
and
that
corrupt
association
which
called
itself
catholicism
i
had
rather
a
bold
and
combative
disposition
and
was
by
no
means
unwilling
to
take
a
share
in
the
battle
all
went
well
for
a
time
the
spirit
of
inquiry
is
not
considered
an
evil
spirit
so
long
as
it
only
leads
to
agreement
with
established
doctrines
and
as
an
advanced
form
of
protestantism
was
preached
in
burnley
church
i
was
at
liberty
to
think
boldly
enough
provided
i
did
not
go
beyond
that
particular
stage
of
thought
not
having
as
yet
any
disposition
to
go
beyond
i
did
not
at
all
realize
what
a
very
small
degree
of
intellectual
liberty
my
teachers
were
really
disposed
to
allow
me
one
occasion
i
remember
distinctly
bardsley
was
at
hollins
where
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
as
he
was
leaning
on
the
he
spoke
about
german
neology
which
i
had
never
heard
of
before
so
i
asked
what
it
was
and
he
described
it
as
a
dreadful
doctrine
which
attributed
no
more
inspiration
to
sacred
than
to
profane
writers
the
ladies
were
shocked
and
scandalized
by
the
bare
mention
of
such
a
doctrine
but
the
effect
on
me
was
very
different
the
next
day
in
my
private
meditations
i
began
to
wonder
what
were
the
evidences
by
which
it
was
determined
that
some
writers
were
inspired
and
infallible
and
what
critics
had
settled
the
question
the
orthodox
reader
will
say
that
in
a
perplexity
of
this
kind
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
carry
my
difficulty
to
a
clergyman
this
is
exactly
what
i
did
and
the
clergyman
was
bardsley
himself
he
was
full
of
kindness
to
me
and
took
the
trouble
to
write
a
long
paper
on
the
subject
which
must
have
cost
him
fully
two
days
work
a
paper
in
which
he
gave
a
full
account
of
the
canon
of
scripture
from
the
evangelical
point
of
view
the
effect
on
me
was
most
discouraging
for
the
result
amounted
merely
to
this
that
certain
councils
of
the
church
had
recognized
the
divine
inspiration
of
certain
books
just
as
certain
authoritative
critics
might
recognize
the
profane
inspiration
of
poets
after
reading
the
paper
with
the
utmost
care
i
felt
so
embarrassed
about
it
that
with
the
awkwardness
of
youth
i
did
not
even
write
to
thank
the
amiable
author
who
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
help
me
and
i
only
thanked
him
briefly
on
meeting
him
at
a
friend
house
where
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
the
interchange
of
a
few
words
this
autobiography
is
not
intended
to
be
a
book
of
controversy
so
i
shall
carefully
avoid
the
details
of
religious
changes
and
give
only
results
i
do
not
think
that
anything
in
my
life
was
ever
more
decisive
than
the
receipt
of
that
long
communication
from
bardsley
the
day
before
receiving
it
i
was
in
doubt
but
the
day
after
i
felt
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
books
known
to
englishmen
as
the
scriptures
rested
simply
on
the
opinion
of
different
bodies
of
theologians
who
had
held
meetings
which
were
called
councils
the
only
difference
between
these
councils
and
those
of
the
church
of
rome
was
that
these
were
represented
as
having
taken
place
earlier
before
the
church
was
so
much
divided
but
it
did
not
seem
at
all
evident
that
the
members
of
the
earlier
councils
were
men
of
a
higher
stamp
intellectually
than
those
who
composed
the
distinctly
roman
catholic
councils
nor
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
holy
spirit
had
been
with
those
earlier
councils
though
it
afterwards
withdrew
itself
from
the
later
the
protestant
reader
will
perhaps
kindly
bear
with
me
whilst
i
give
the
reasons
why
i
ceased
to
be
a
protestant
after
having
been
so
earnest
and
zealous
in
that
form
of
the
christian
faith
it
appeared
to
me
i
do
not
say
it
but
it
appeared
to
me
and
appears
to
me
still
that
protestantism
is
an
uncritical
belief
in
the
decisions
of
the
church
down
to
a
date
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
fix
exactly
and
an
equally
uncritical
scepticism
a
scepticism
of
the
most
unreceptive
kind
with
regard
to
all
opinions
professed
and
all
events
said
to
have
taken
place
in
the
more
recent
centuries
of
ecclesiastical
history
the
church
of
rome
on
the
other
hand
seemed
nearer
in
temper
to
the
temper
of
the
past
and
was
more
decidedly
a
continuation
though
evidently
at
the
same
time
an
amplification
of
the
early
christian
habits
of
thinking
and
believing
with
this
altered
view
of
the
subject
the
alternative
that
presented
itself
to
me
was
that
which
presented
itself
to
the
brothers
newman
and
if
i
had
found
it
necessary
to
my
happiness
to
belong
to
a
visible
church
of
some
kind
and
if
devotional
feelings
had
been
stronger
than
the
desire
for
mental
independence
i
should
have
joined
the
church
of
rome
there
were
indeed
two
or
three
strong
temptations
to
that
course
my
family
had
been
a
catholic
family
in
the
past
and
had
sacrificed
much
for
the
church
of
rome
when
she
was
laboring
under
oppression
for
a
hamerton
to
return
to
her
would
therefore
have
been
quite
in
accordance
with
those
romantic
sentiments
about
distant
ancestors
which
were
at
that
time
very
strong
in
me
besides
this
i
had
all
the
feeling
for
the
august
ceremonial
of
the
catholic
church
which
is
found
in
the
writer
who
most
influenced
me
sir
walter
scott
and
there
was
already
a
certain
consciousness
of
artistic
necessities
and
congruities
which
made
me
dimly
aware
that
if
you
admit
the
glories
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
it
is
only
the
asceticism
of
puritan
rebellion
against
art
that
can
deny
magnificence
to
ritual
i
had
occasionally
though
rarely
been
present
at
high
mass
and
had
felt
a
certain
elevating
influence
and
if
i
had
said
to
myself
religion
is
only
a
poem
by
which
the
soul
is
raised
to
the
contemplation
of
the
eternal
mysteries
then
i
could
have
dreamed
vaguely
in
this
contemplation
better
perhaps
in
the
roman
catholic
church
than
in
any
other
but
my
english
and
protestant
education
was
against
a
religion
of
dreaming
an
english
protestant
may
have
his
poetical
side
may
be
capable
of
feeling
poetry
that
is
frankly
avowed
to
be
such
may
read
tennyson
eve
of
agnes
or
hymn
to
the
virgin
with
almost
complete
imaginative
sympathy
but
he
expects
to
believe
his
religion
as
firmly
as
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
the
british
islands
such
at
least
was
the
temper
that
belonged
to
protestantism
in
those
days
in
more
recent
times
a
more
hazy
religion
has
become
fashionable
my
decision
therefore
for
some
time
was
to
remain
in
a
provisional
condition
of
prolonged
inquiry
i
read
a
great
deal
on
both
sides
and
constantly
prayed
for
light
following
regularly
the
external
services
of
the
church
of
england
here
the
subject
may
be
left
for
the
present
the
reader
is
to
imagine
me
as
a
youth
who
no
longer
believed
in
the
special
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
or
in
their
infallibility
but
who
was
still
a
christian
as
thousands
of
liberal
church
people
in
the
present
day
are
christians
before
resuming
my
religious
history
i
ought
to
mention
an
influence
which
was
supposed
by
my
friends
to
have
been
powerful
over
me
but
which
in
reality
had
slightly
affected
the
current
of
my
thinking
our
medical
adviser
was
a
surgeon
rather
advanced
in
years
and
whose
private
fortune
made
him
independent
of
professional
success
as
time
went
on
he
allowed
himself
to
be
more
and
more
replaced
by
his
assistant
uttley
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characters
i
ever
met
with
in
those
days
in
a
northern
provincial
town
it
required
immense
courage
to
avow
religious
heterodoxy
of
any
advanced
kind
yet
uttley
said
with
the
utmost
simplicity
that
he
was
an
atheist
and
the
religious
world
called
him
uttley
the
atheist
a
title
which
he
accepted
as
naturally
as
if
it
implied
no
contempt
or
antagonism
whatever
he
was
by
no
means
devoid
of
physical
courage
also
for
i
remember
that
at
one
time
he
rode
an
ugly
brute
that
had
a
most
dangerous
habit
of
bolting
and
he
would
not
permit
me
to
mount
her
he
was
excessively
temperate
in
his
habits
never
drinking
anything
stronger
than
water
except
perhaps
a
cup
of
tea
i
am
not
sure
about
the
tea
and
never
eating
more
than
he
believed
to
be
necessary
to
health
he
maintained
the
doctrine
that
hunger
remains
for
a
time
after
the
stomach
has
had
enough
and
that
if
you
go
on
eating
to
satiety
you
are
intemperate
he
disliked
and
i
believe
despised
the
habit
of
stuffing
on
festive
occasions
which
used
to
be
common
in
the
wealthier
middle
classes
i
confess
that
uttley
fearless
honesty
and
steady
abstemiousness
impressed
me
with
the
admiration
that
one
can
not
but
feel
for
the
great
virtues
by
whomsoever
practised
but
uttley
had
a
third
virtue
which
is
so
rare
in
england
as
to
be
almost
unintelligible
to
the
majority
he
looked
with
the
most
serene
indifference
on
social
struggles
on
the
arts
by
which
people
rise
in
the
world
perfectly
contented
with
his
own
station
in
life
and
a
man
of
remarkably
few
wants
he
lived
on
from
year
to
year
without
ambition
finding
his
chief
interest
in
the
pursuit
of
his
profession
and
his
greatest
pleasure
in
his
books
he
so
little
attempted
to
make
a
proselyte
of
me
that
when
at
a
later
period
i
told
him
of
a
certain
change
of
views
concerning
which
more
will
be
said
in
the
sequel
he
was
unaffectedly
surprised
by
it
and
said
that
he
had
never
supposed
me
to
be
other
than
what
i
appeared
to
the
world
in
general
an
ordinary
member
of
the
church
of
england
my
intimate
knowledge
of
uttley
remarkable
character
must
have
had
nevertheless
a
certain
influence
in
this
way
that
it
enabled
me
to
estimate
the
vulgar
attacks
on
infidels
at
their
true
worth
and
though
my
own
theistic
beliefs
were
very
strong
i
knew
from
this
example
that
an
atheist
was
not
necessarily
a
monster
the
only
occasions
that
i
remember
in
youth
when
uttley
might
have
influenced
me
were
these
two
being
curious
to
know
about
opinions
from
those
who
really
held
them
and
being
already
convinced
that
we
can
not
really
know
them
from
the
misrepresentations
of
their
enemies
i
once
asked
uttley
what
atheism
really
was
and
why
it
recommended
itself
to
him
he
replied
that
atheism
was
in
his
view
the
acceptance
of
the
smaller
of
two
difficulties
both
of
which
were
still
very
great
the
smaller
difficulty
for
him
was
to
believe
in
the
of
the
universe
the
greater
was
to
believe
in
a
single
being
without
a
beginning
who
could
create
millions
of
solar
systems
and
as
one
or
the
other
must
be
the
difficulty
about
was
common
to
both
cases
the
argument
from
design
did
not
convince
him
as
he
believed
in
a
continual
process
of
natural
adjustment
of
creatures
to
their
environment
a
theory
resembling
that
of
darwin
but
not
yet
so
complete
i
listened
to
uttley
account
of
his
views
with
much
interest
but
they
had
no
influence
on
my
own
as
it
seemed
to
me
much
easier
to
refer
everything
to
an
intelligent
creator
than
to
believe
in
the
of
all
the
intricate
organizations
that
we
see
still
i
was
not
indignant
as
the
reader
may
think
i
ought
to
have
been
it
seemed
to
me
quite
natural
that
thoughtful
men
should
hold
different
opinions
on
a
subject
of
such
infinite
difficulty
the
other
occasion
was
when
in
the
vigor
of
youthful
protestantism
i
happened
to
say
something
against
the
church
of
rome
uttley
very
quietly
and
kindly
told
me
that
i
was
unjust
towards
that
church
and
i
asked
him
where
the
injustice
lay
it
lies
in
this
he
replied
that
you
despise
the
dogmas
of
the
church
of
rome
as
resting
only
on
the
authority
of
priests
whereas
the
case
of
that
church
is
not
exceptional
or
peculiar
as
dogmas
rest
ultimately
on
the
authority
of
priests
to
this
i
naturally
answered
that
scriptural
authority
was
higher
but
uttley
answered
the
roman
catholics
themselves
appeal
to
scriptural
authority
as
the
protestants
do
but
it
is
still
the
priests
who
have
decided
which
books
are
sacred
and
how
they
are
to
be
interpreted
his
conversation
was
not
longer
than
my
report
of
it
and
it
occurred
when
i
met
uttley
accidentally
in
the
street
but
though
short
it
was
of
some
importance
as
i
happened
at
that
time
to
be
exercised
in
my
mind
about
what
bardsley
had
told
us
concerning
german
neology
subsequent
observation
has
led
me
to
believe
that
uttley
attributed
more
originating
authority
to
priests
than
really
belongs
to
them
it
seems
to
me
now
that
they
take
up
and
consecrate
popular
beliefs
that
may
be
of
use
and
that
they
drop
and
discard
either
tacitly
or
openly
those
beliefs
which
are
no
longer
popular
both
processes
have
been
going
on
for
some
years
very
visibly
in
the
church
of
rome
and
the
second
of
the
two
is
plainly
in
operation
in
the
church
of
england
chapter
xiv
first
visit
to
london
in
my
first
impression
of
the
nostalgia
of
the
the
royal
resolution
never
to
go
to
london
reason
why
this
resolution
was
afterwards
broken
in
the
year
i
went
to
london
for
the
first
time
to
see
the
great
exhibition
our
little
party
consisted
only
of
my
guardian
my
aunt
and
myself
my
first
impression
of
london
was
exactly
what
it
has
ever
since
remained
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
disagreeable
place
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
wondered
how
anybody
could
live
there
who
was
not
absolutely
compelled
to
do
so
at
that
time
i
did
not
understand
the
only
valid
reason
for
living
in
london
which
is
the
satisfaction
of
meeting
with
intelligent
people
who
know
something
about
what
interests
you
and
do
not
consider
you
eccentric
because
you
take
an
interest
in
something
that
is
not
precisely
and
exclusively
my
aunts
knew
nobody
in
london
except
one
or
two
ladies
of
rank
superior
to
their
own
on
whom
we
made
formal
calls
which
was
a
sort
of
human
intercourse
that
i
heartily
detested
as
i
detest
it
to
this
day
our
lodgings
were
in
baker
street
which
after
our
pure
air
open
scenery
and
complete
liberty
at
hollins
seemed
to
me
like
a
prison
the
lodgings
were
not
particularly
clean
the
carpets
especially
seemed
as
if
they
had
never
been
taken
up
the
air
was
heavy
the
water
was
bad
our
water
at
hollins
was
clearer
than
glass
and
if
you
poured
a
goblet
of
it
beady
bubbles
clung
to
the
sides
there
was
no
view
except
up
street
and
down
street
and
the
noise
was
perpetual
a
londoner
would
take
these
inconveniences
as
a
matter
of
course
and
be
insensible
to
them
but
to
me
they
were
so
unpleasant
that
i
suffered
from
nostalgia
of
the
country
all
the
time
the
reader
may
advantageously
be
spared
my
boyish
impressions
of
the
great
exhibition
and
the
other
sights
of
london
of
course
we
fatigued
our
brains
as
country
people
always
do
by
seeing
too
many
things
in
a
limited
time
and
as
we
had
no
special
purpose
in
view
we
got
i
fear
very
little
instruction
from
our
wanderings
amidst
the
bewildering
products
of
human
industry
i
remember
being
profoundly
impressed
by
westminster
abbey
though
i
would
gladly
have
seen
all
the
modern
monuments
calcined
in
a
and
westminster
hall
affected
me
even
more
possibly
because
one
of
our
ancestors
sir
stephen
hamerton
had
been
condemned
to
death
there
for
high
treason
in
the
time
of
henry
viii
i
was
also
deeply
impressed
by
the
grim
old
tower
of
london
and
only
regretted
that
i
did
not
know
which
cell
the
unlucky
sir
stephen
had
occupied
during
his
hopeless
imprisonment
there
the
rooms
of
the
royal
academy
left
a
more
durable
recollection
than
the
contents
of
the
great
building
in
hyde
park
those
are
quite
old
times
for
us
now
in
the
history
of
english
art
sir
frederick
leighton
was
a
young
student
who
had
not
yet
begun
to
exhibit
i
think
he
was
working
in
frankfort
then
millais
was
already
known
as
the
painter
of
strange
and
vivid
pictures
of
small
size
which
attracted
attention
and
put
the
public
into
a
state
of
much
embarrassment
there
were
three
of
these
strange
pictures
that
year
an
illustration
of
tennyson
she
only
said
life
is
dreary
the
return
of
the
dove
to
the
ark
and
the
woodman
daughter
i
distinctly
remember
the
exact
sensation
with
which
my
young
eyes
saw
these
works
so
distinctly
that
i
now
positively
feel
those
early
sensations
over
again
in
thinking
about
them
all
was
so
fresh
so
new
this
modern
art
was
such
a
novelty
to
one
who
had
not
seen
many
modern
pictures
and
my
own
powers
of
enjoying
art
were
so
entirely
unspoiled
by
the
effect
of
habit
that
i
was
like
a
young
bird
in
its
first
in
the
woods
i
much
preferred
the
beautiful
bright
pictures
in
the
academy
with
their
greens
and
blues
like
nature
to
the
snuffy
old
canvases
as
they
seemed
to
me
in
the
national
gallery
the
oddest
result
for
a
boy
first
visit
to
london
was
a
quiet
mental
resolution
of
which
i
said
nothing
to
anybody
what
i
thought
and
resolved
inwardly
may
be
accurately
expressed
in
these
words
every
englishman
who
can
afford
it
ought
to
see
london
as
a
patriotic
duty
and
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
been
there
to
have
got
the
duty
performed
but
no
power
on
earth
shall
ever
induce
me
to
go
to
that
supremely
disagreeable
place
again
of
course
the
intelligent
reader
considers
this
boyish
resolution
impossible
and
absurd
as
it
is
entirely
contrary
to
prevalent
ideas
but
a
man
may
lead
a
very
complete
life
in
lancashire
and
even
in
counties
less
rich
in
various
interest
without
ever
going
to
london
at
all
a
man
own
fields
may
afford
him
as
good
exercise
as
hyde
park
and
his
little
library
as
good
reading
as
the
british
museum
it
was
the
fine
arts
that
brought
me
to
london
afterwards
the
worst
of
the
fine
arts
being
that
they
concentrate
themselves
so
much
in
great
capitals
chapter
xv
the
love
of
reading
a
hindrance
to
classical
dr
butler
becomes
anxious
about
my
success
at
an
insuperable
my
indifference
to
irksome
i
am
nearly
sent
to
a
tutor
at
i
go
to
a
tutor
in
his
disagreeable
incident
about
disastrous
effect
of
my
tutor
intellectual
influence
upon
my
private
my
tutor
ignorance
of
modern
his
ignorance
of
the
fine
his
religious
i
declare
my
inability
to
sign
the
articles
the
various
mental
activities
hinted
at
in
the
preceding
chapters
had
naturally
a
retarding
effect
upon
my
classical
studies
which
i
had
never
greatly
taken
to
it
seemed
then
and
it
seems
to
me
still
that
for
one
who
does
not
intend
to
make
a
living
by
teaching
them
the
dead
languages
like
all
other
pursuits
are
only
worth
a
limited
amount
of
labor
it
may
appear
paradoxical
at
first
but
it
is
true
that
one
reason
why
i
did
not
like
latin
and
greek
was
because
i
was
extremely
fond
of
reading
the
case
is
this
if
you
are
fond
of
reading
and
have
an
evening
at
your
disposal
you
will
wish
to
read
will
you
not
but
is
not
reading
it
is
quite
a
different
mental
operation
when
you
you
think
of
the
scenes
and
events
the
author
narrates
or
you
follow
his
reasoning
but
when
you
you
think
of
cases
and
tenses
and
remember
grammatical
rules
i
could
read
english
and
french
but
latin
and
greek
were
only
to
be
construed
coups
de
the
case
may
be
illustrated
by
reference
to
an
amusement
a
man
who
is
indifferent
to
rowing
cares
very
little
what
sort
of
boat
he
is
in
and
toils
contentedly
as
peasants
do
in
their
heavy
boots
but
a
lover
of
rowing
wants
a
craft
that
he
can
move
this
desire
is
quite
independent
of
the
merits
of
the
craft
itself
considered
without
reference
to
the
man
a
sailing
yacht
may
he
a
beautiful
vessel
but
an
oxford
oarsman
would
not
desire
to
pull
one
of
her
cumbersome
sweeps
i
was
at
that
time
a
private
pupil
of
butler
and
was
getting
on
at
such
a
very
moderate
pace
that
he
began
to
be
anxious
about
his
responsibility
my
guardian
and
he
had
decided
together
that
i
was
to
be
sent
to
oxford
and
it
was
even
settled
to
which
college
balliol
and
my
dear
guardian
expected
me
to
come
out
in
honors
and
be
a
fellow
of
my
college
and
a
clergyman
that
was
her
plan
and
a
very
good
scheme
of
life
it
was
but
it
had
one
defect
that
of
being
entirely
inapplicable
to
the
human
being
for
whom
it
was
intended
i
looked
forward
to
oxford
with
anything
but
pleasure
and
indeed
considered
that
there
was
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
my
going
there
in
those
days
most
of
the
good
things
in
life
were
kept
as
much
as
possible
for
members
of
the
church
of
england
and
it
was
necessary
to
sign
the
articles
on
entering
the
university
this
i
could
not
do
conscientiously
and
would
not
do
against
the
grain
of
my
conviction
i
looked
upon
this
obstacle
as
insuperable
but
if
i
had
been
as
indifferent
on
such
questions
as
young
men
generally
are
there
would
still
have
remained
a
difficulty
in
my
own
nature
which
is
a
rooted
dislike
to
everything
which
is
done
for
social
advancement
i
might
possibly
have
desired
to
be
a
scholar
but
can
not
imagine
myself
desiring
a
degree
however
i
might
have
taken
the
trouble
to
get
a
degree
simply
to
please
my
guardian
if
there
had
not
been
that
obstacle
about
the
articles
from
this
time
during
a
year
or
two
there
was
a
sort
of
game
of
between
me
and
my
guardian
as
i
had
not
yet
ventured
to
declare
openly
my
severance
from
the
church
of
england
and
my
consequent
inability
to
go
to
one
of
her
universities
the
enormous
weight
of
social
and
family
pressure
that
is
brought
to
bear
on
a
youth
with
reference
to
these
matters
must
be
my
excuse
for
a
year
or
two
of
hypocrisy
that
was
extremely
irksome
to
me
but
besides
this
i
have
a
still
better
excuse
in
a
sincere
unwillingness
to
give
pain
to
my
dear
guardian
and
in
the
dread
lest
the
declaration
of
heresy
might
even
be
dangerous
to
one
whom
i
knew
to
be
suffering
from
heart
disease
i
therefore
lived
on
as
a
young
member
of
the
church
of
england
who
was
studying
for
oxford
when
in
fact
i
considered
myself
no
longer
a
member
of
that
church
and
had
inwardly
renounced
all
intention
of
going
to
either
of
the
universities
which
she
still
kept
closed
against
the
dissenters
the
inward
determination
not
to
go
to
oxford
or
cambridge
had
a
bad
effect
on
my
classical
studies
as
i
had
no
other
object
in
view
whilst
pursuing
them
than
the
intellectual
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
studies
themselves
and
i
had
not
any
very
great
faith
in
that
benefit
the
most
intelligent
men
i
knew
did
not
happen
to
be
classical
scholars
and
some
men
of
my
acquaintance
who
classical
scholars
seemed
to
me
quite
impervious
to
ideas
concerning
science
and
the
fine
arts
even
now
after
a
much
larger
experience
i
do
not
perceive
that
classical
scholarship
opens
men
minds
to
scientific
and
artistic
ideas
or
even
that
scholarship
gives
much
appreciation
of
literary
art
and
excellence
still
it
is
better
to
have
it
than
to
be
without
it
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
scholarly
temper
a
patient
careful
exact
and
studious
temper
which
is
valuable
in
all
the
pursuits
of
life
butler
had
been
for
some
time
my
private
tutor
which
means
that
i
prepared
my
work
at
hollins
in
the
morning
and
went
to
read
with
butler
in
the
afternoon
the
plan
was
pleasant
enough
for
me
but
it
was
not
advantageous
because
what
i
most
wanted
was
guidance
during
my
hours
of
study
such
guidance
as
i
had
at
doncaster
however
i
read
and
wrote
latin
and
greek
every
day
and
learned
french
at
the
same
time
as
butler
had
a
taste
for
modern
languages
this
went
on
until
he
became
rather
alarmed
about
my
success
at
oxford
which
for
reasons
known
to
the
reader
troubled
me
very
little
and
told
my
guardian
that
she
ought
to
send
me
to
some
tutor
who
could
bestow
upon
me
more
continuous
attention
i
was
as
near
as
possible
to
being
sent
to
a
tutor
at
brighton
a
reverend
gentleman
with
aristocratic
connections
but
he
missed
having
me
by
the
very
bait
which
he
held
out
to
attract
my
guardian
he
boasted
in
a
letter
of
the
young
lords
he
had
educated
and
said
he
had
one
or
two
still
in
the
house
with
him
we
had
a
near
neighbor
and
old
friend
who
was
herself
very
nearly
connected
with
two
of
the
greatest
families
in
the
peerage
and
as
she
happened
to
call
upon
us
when
my
guardian
received
the
letter
it
was
handed
to
her
and
she
said
that
bit
about
the
young
lords
is
not
a
recommendation
the
chances
are
that
would
find
them
proud
and
disagreeable
as
for
me
the
whole
project
presented
nothing
that
was
pleasant
i
disliked
the
south
of
england
and
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
noblemen
it
was
therefore
rather
a
relief
that
the
brighton
project
was
abandoned
it
happened
then
that
my
dear
guardian
did
the
only
one
foolish
and
wrong
thing
she
ever
did
in
her
whole
life
she
sent
me
to
a
clergyman
in
yorkshire
who
had
been
a
tutor
at
oxford
and
was
considered
to
be
a
good
coach
so
far
he
may
seem
to
have
been
the
right
man
but
he
was
unfortunately
exactly
the
man
to
inspire
me
with
a
complete
disgust
for
my
studies
he
had
no
consideration
whatever
for
the
feelings
of
other
people
least
of
all
for
those
of
a
pupil
he
treated
me
with
open
contempt
and
was
always
trying
to
humiliate
me
till
at
last
i
let
him
understand
that
i
would
endure
it
no
longer
one
day
he
ordered
me
to
clean
his
harness
with
a
peremptoriness
that
he
would
scarcely
have
used
to
a
groom
so
i
answered
no
sir
i
shall
not
clean
your
harness
that
is
not
my
work
he
then
asked
whether
i
considered
myself
a
gentleman
i
said
yes
and
he
retorted
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
thrash
the
gentility
out
of
me
on
which
i
told
him
that
if
he
ventured
to
attempt
any
such
thing
i
should
certainly
defend
myself
i
was
a
youth
and
could
have
beaten
my
tutor
easily
one
day
he
attempted
to
scrape
my
face
with
a
piece
of
shark
skin
so
i
seized
both
his
wrists
and
held
them
for
some
time
telling
him
that
the
jest
if
it
was
a
jest
was
not
acceptable
as
my
tutor
was
very
handsomely
paid
for
the
small
amount
of
trouble
he
took
with
me
my
guardian
had
inserted
in
the
agreement
a
clause
by
which
he
was
either
to
keep
my
horse
in
his
stable
or
else
let
me
have
the
use
of
one
of
his
own
he
preferred
for
economy
sake
to
mount
me
so
in
accordance
with
our
agreement
i
innocently
rode
out
a
little
in
the
early
mornings
long
before
the
hour
fixed
for
our
greek
reading
together
as
my
tutor
rose
late
he
was
not
aware
of
this
for
some
time
but
at
length
by
accident
he
found
it
out
and
then
an
incident
occurred
which
exactly
paints
the
charming
amenity
of
the
man
his
had
brought
the
horse
to
the
gate
and
i
was
just
mounting
when
my
tutor
opened
his
bedroom
window
and
called
out
take
that
horse
back
to
the
stable
immediately
i
said
to
the
servant
who
hesitated
that
it
was
his
duty
to
obey
his
master
orders
and
dismounted
then
i
went
to
my
lodgings
in
the
village
and
wrote
a
note
to
the
tutor
in
which
i
said
that
i
expected
him
to
keep
his
agreement
and
in
accordance
with
it
i
should
ride
out
that
day
i
then
left
the
note
at
the
house
saddled
the
animal
myself
and
rode
a
long
distance
from
that
time
our
relations
were
those
of
constrained
formality
which
on
the
whole
i
much
preferred
my
tutor
assumed
an
air
of
injured
innocence
and
treated
me
with
a
clumsy
imitation
of
politeness
which
was
intended
to
wound
me
but
which
i
found
extremely
convenient
as
the
greater
the
distance
between
us
the
less
intercourse
there
would
be
however
after
that
demonstration
of
my
rights
i
kept
a
horse
of
my
own
a
much
finer
animal
at
a
farmer
the
intellectual
influence
of
my
present
tutor
was
disastrous
by
the
reaction
it
produced
he
was
a
fanatical
admirer
of
the
ancient
authors
who
wrote
in
latin
and
greek
and
was
constantly
expressing
his
contempt
for
modern
literature
of
which
he
was
extremely
ignorant
i
was
fond
of
reading
and
had
english
books
in
my
lodgings
which
were
my
refuge
and
solace
after
the
pedantic
lectures
i
had
to
undergo
my
love
for
scott
was
still
very
lively
as
indeed
it
is
to
this
day
but
i
had
now
extended
my
horizon
and
added
byron
shelley
tennyson
and
other
modern
authors
to
my
list
my
tutor
had
all
the
hatred
for
byron
which
distinguished
the
clergy
in
the
poet
and
he
was
constantly
saying
the
most
unjust
things
against
him
as
for
example
that
the
bride
of
abydos
was
not
original
but
was
copied
from
the
greek
of
moschus
this
clerical
hatred
for
byron
quite
prevented
my
tutor
from
acquiring
any
knowledge
of
the
poet
but
he
had
seen
a
copy
of
his
works
at
my
lodgings
and
this
served
as
a
text
for
the
most
violent
diatribes
as
for
shelley
he
knew
no
more
about
him
than
that
he
had
been
accused
of
atheism
he
had
heard
of
moore
whom
he
called
tommy
i
believe
he
had
never
heard
of
keats
or
tennyson
certainly
he
was
quite
unacquainted
with
their
poems
he
had
a
feeble
incipient
knowledge
of
french
and
occasionally
read
a
page
of
moli√®re
with
an
unimaginable
pronunciation
but
he
knew
nothing
really
of
any
modern
literature
on
the
other
hand
his
knowledge
of
the
greek
and
latin
classics
was
more
intimate
than
that
possessed
by
any
other
teacher
i
had
ever
known
he
was
a
thorough
scholar
with
all
the
pride
of
exact
erudition
and
a
corresponding
contempt
for
everybody
who
did
not
possess
it
i
do
not
at
this
moment
remember
that
he
ever
referred
to
a
dictionary
i
only
remember
that
he
examined
my
liddell
and
scott
to
see
whether
those
modern
lexicographers
had
done
their
work
in
a
way
to
merit
his
approval
and
that
he
thought
their
book
might
be
useful
to
me
he
had
some
knowledge
of
astronomy
and
was
building
a
reflecting
telescope
which
he
never
completed
but
i
remember
that
he
was
often
occupied
in
polishing
the
reflectors
whilst
i
was
reading
and
that
his
hand
went
on
rubbing
with
a
bit
of
soft
leather
and
a
red
powder
when
he
would
deliver
the
clearest
disquisitions
on
the
employment
of
words
by
greek
authors
most
of
which
i
was
not
sufficiently
advanced
to
profit
by
his
manner
with
me
was
impatient
and
often
rude
and
contemptuous
what
irritated
him
especially
in
me
was
the
strange
inequality
of
my
learning
for
i
was
rather
strong
on
some
points
and
equally
weak
on
others
whilst
he
himself
had
an
irresistible
regularity
of
knowledge
at
least
in
latin
and
greek
we
did
absolutely
nothing
else
but
latin
and
greek
during
my
stay
with
this
tutor
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
made
some
progress
but
there
was
no
of
progress
in
comparison
with
the
completeness
of
my
master
terrible
erudition
it
seemed
that
my
small
acquirements
were
nothing
and
never
could
be
more
than
nothing
on
the
other
hand
the
extreme
narrowness
of
his
literary
tastes
led
me
to
place
a
higher
value
on
my
own
increasing
knowledge
of
modern
literature
and
conclusively
proved
to
me
once
for
all
that
a
classical
education
does
not
necessarily
give
a
just
or
accurate
judgment
if
a
man
i
said
to
myself
can
be
a
thorough
classical
scholar
as
my
tutor
is
and
at
the
same
time
so
narrow
and
ignorant
it
is
clear
that
a
classical
training
does
not
possess
the
virtue
of
opening
the
mind
which
is
ascribed
to
it
besides
his
narrowness
with
regard
to
modern
literature
of
all
kinds
my
tutor
had
the
usual
characteristic
of
the
classical
scholars
of
his
generation
a
complete
ignorance
and
misunderstanding
of
the
fine
arts
all
that
he
knew
on
that
subject
was
that
a
certain
picture
by
titian
was
shameful
because
there
was
a
naked
woman
in
it
and
i
believe
he
had
heard
that
claude
was
a
famous
but
he
had
no
conception
whatever
of
the
aims
and
purposes
of
art
one
of
his
accusations
against
me
was
that
from
vanity
i
had
painted
a
portrait
of
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
little
picture
was
a
portrait
of
lord
byron
done
from
an
engraving
but
any
artist
may
without
vanity
make
use
of
his
own
face
as
a
model
in
religion
my
tutor
was
most
intolerant
he
could
not
endure
either
roman
catholics
or
dissenters
of
any
kind
and
considered
no
terms
harsh
enough
for
infidels
he
told
with
approbation
the
story
of
some
bigot
like
himself
who
when
an
unbeliever
came
into
his
house
had
loudly
ordered
the
servant
to
lock
up
the
silver
spoons
he
possessed
and
read
with
approbation
one
of
those
intolerant
books
of
the
eighteenth
century
entitled
a
short
method
with
deists
in
which
the
poor
deists
were
crushed
beneath
the
pitiless
heel
of
the
dominant
state
church
it
happened
one
day
by
a
strange
chance
that
an
antiquary
brought
a
unitarian
minister
who
also
took
an
interest
in
archaeology
to
visit
the
church
where
my
tutor
officiated
in
which
there
were
some
old
things
and
as
they
stayed
in
the
church
till
our
early
my
tutor
could
hardly
do
otherwise
than
offer
them
a
little
hospitality
when
the
guests
had
gone
i
hope
they
enjoyed
the
conversation
which
seemed
to
me
artificial
and
constrained
my
tutor
said
to
me
that
man
that
unitarian
will
go
to
hell
all
who
do
not
believe
in
the
atonement
will
go
to
hell
i
said
nothing
but
thought
that
the
mild
antiquary
who
sat
with
us
at
table
might
deserve
a
less
terrible
fate
my
tutor
troubled
me
less
perhaps
about
theology
than
might
have
been
expected
he
intended
to
inflict
much
more
theology
upon
me
than
i
really
had
to
undergo
thanks
to
his
indolence
and
the
craft
and
subtlety
with
which
i
managed
to
substitute
other
work
for
it
still
it
was
a
trial
to
me
to
have
to
look
acquiescent
or
at
least
submissive
and
respectful
whilst
he
said
the
most
unjust
and
intolerant
things
about
those
who
differed
from
him
and
with
whom
i
often
secretly
agreed
and
of
course
i
had
to
listen
to
his
sermons
every
sunday
and
to
go
through
the
outward
seemings
of
conformity
that
my
master
had
power
enough
to
exact
from
me
beyond
the
weekly
services
in
the
church
he
fulfilled
scarcely
any
of
the
duties
of
a
parish
clergyman
he
rose
about
eleven
in
the
morning
and
spent
his
time
either
in
mechanical
pursuits
or
in
desultory
reading
often
of
the
greek
and
latin
classics
in
fact
my
tutor
mind
was
so
imbued
with
the
dead
languages
that
he
was
unable
to
write
his
own
but
had
constant
recourse
to
greek
and
latin
to
make
his
meaning
clear
a
year
spent
with
this
clergyman
with
whom
i
had
not
two
ideas
in
common
produced
an
effect
upon
me
exactly
opposite
to
that
which
had
been
intended
my
feelings
towards
the
ancient
classics
had
grown
into
positive
repugnance
when
i
saw
the
moderns
so
unjustly
sacrificed
to
them
and
my
love
for
the
moderns
had
increased
to
the
point
of
partisanship
my
tutor
injustice
towards
dissenters
and
unbelievers
had
also
by
a
natural
reaction
aroused
in
me
a
profound
sympathy
for
these
maligned
and
despised
people
and
i
would
willingly
have
joined
some
dissenting
body
myself
if
i
could
have
found
one
that
had
exactly
my
own
opinions
but
it
seemed
useless
to
leave
the
church
of
england
for
another
community
if
i
were
no
more
in
accordance
with
the
new
than
with
the
old
the
fact
that
my
master
had
been
a
tutor
at
oxford
and
was
always
boasting
about
his
university
career
he
openly
expressed
his
contempt
for
men
who
had
never
seen
the
smoke
of
a
university
made
me
sick
of
the
very
name
of
the
place
and
to
this
day
i
have
never
visited
it
in
a
word
my
tutor
made
me
dislike
the
very
things
that
it
was
his
business
to
make
me
like
and
if
i
had
ever
felt
the
least
desire
for
a
degree
he
would
have
cured
me
of
it
as
it
was
impossible
to
desire
honors
that
were
accessible
to
so
narrow
a
mind
as
his
a
mind
fit
for
nothing
but
pedagogy
and
really
unable
to
appreciate
either
literature
or
art
at
the
end
of
a
year
therefore
i
said
plainly
to
my
guardian
that
i
was
doing
no
good
and
that
it
was
useless
to
prepare
me
any
further
for
oxford
as
i
could
not
conscientiously
put
my
name
to
the
articles
if
in
those
days
any
human
being
in
our
class
of
society
in
england
had
been
able
to
conceive
of
such
a
thing
as
education
not
in
clerical
hands
i
might
have
gone
on
with
my
classical
studies
under
the
direction
of
a
layman
but
education
and
the
clergy
were
looked
upon
as
inseparable
even
by
myself
my
education
therefore
came
momentarily
to
a
though
it
happened
a
little
later
that
a
sense
of
its
imperfection
made
me
take
it
up
again
with
fresh
energy
on
my
own
account
and
i
am
still
working
at
it
in
various
directions
at
the
mature
age
of
chapter
xvi
choice
of
a
love
of
literature
and
decision
to
make
trial
of
an
equestrian
i
take
lessons
from
p
my
horse
greenock
a
my
unsettled
loch
lomond
loch
a
sailing
mull
and
solitary
reading
the
question
of
a
profession
now
required
an
immediate
decision
my
guardian
choice
for
me
had
formerly
been
the
church
but
that
was
not
exactly
suited
to
my
ways
of
thinking
the
most
natural
profession
for
a
young
man
in
my
position
would
have
been
the
law
but
my
father
had
expressly
desired
that
i
should
not
adopt
it
as
he
was
sick
of
it
for
himself
and
wished
to
spare
me
its
anxieties
the
cotton
trade
required
a
larger
disposable
capital
than
i
possessed
to
start
with
any
chance
of
success
my
own
desires
were
equally
balanced
between
two
pursuits
for
which
i
had
a
great
liking
and
hoped
that
there
might
be
some
natural
aptitude
one
of
these
was
literature
and
the
other
painting
a
very
moderate
success
in
either
of
these
pursuits
would
it
seemed
to
me
be
more
conducive
to
happiness
than
a
greater
success
in
some
less
congenial
occupation
my
fortune
was
enough
for
a
bachelor
and
i
did
not
intend
to
marry
at
least
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
thought
of
ambition
in
connection
with
the
desire
to
follow
one
of
these
two
pursuits
beyond
that
of
the
workman
who
desires
to
do
well
i
mean
i
had
no
social
ambition
in
connection
with
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
liberty
of
thought
which
i
valued
above
everything
was
incompatible
in
england
with
any
desire
to
rise
in
the
world
as
unbelievers
lay
under
a
ban
and
had
no
chance
of
social
advancement
without
renouncing
their
opinions
this
was
an
additional
reason
why
i
should
seek
happiness
in
my
studies
as
a
worldly
success
was
denied
to
me
the
reader
may
perhaps
think
that
i
had
not
much
in
the
way
of
social
advancement
to
renounce
but
in
fact
i
had
a
position
remarkably
full
of
possibilities
that
a
man
of
the
world
could
have
used
to
great
advantage
i
had
independent
means
enough
to
enable
me
as
a
bachelor
to
live
like
a
gentleman
i
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
and
families
in
the
english
untitled
aristocracy
had
a
retentive
memory
a
strong
voice
and
could
speak
in
public
without
embarrassment
a
man
of
the
world
in
my
position
would
have
found
his
upward
course
straight
before
him
he
would
simply
have
made
use
of
the
church
as
an
instrument
it
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
instruments
for
the
worldly
have
given
himself
the
advantages
of
oxford
married
for
money
offered
his
services
to
the
conservative
party
and
gone
into
parliament
footnote
the
reader
may
wonder
why
the
party
is
specially
mentioned
it
is
mentioned
simply
because
all
my
relations
and
nearly
all
my
influential
friends
who
could
have
pushed
me
belonged
to
it
the
conservative
party
is
also
the
one
that
gives
the
best
social
promotion
to
those
who
serve
it
there
have
been
many
little
beaconsfields
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
do
all
that
than
to
make
a
reputation
either
in
literature
or
painting
easier
i
mean
for
a
man
starting
in
life
with
so
many
good
cards
in
his
hand
as
i
had
i
have
been
sometimes
represented
as
an
unsuccessful
painter
who
took
to
writing
because
he
had
failed
as
an
artist
it
is
of
course
easy
to
state
the
matter
so
but
the
exact
truth
is
that
a
very
moderate
success
in
either
literature
or
art
would
have
been
equally
acceptable
to
me
so
that
there
has
been
no
other
failure
in
my
life
than
the
usual
one
of
not
being
able
to
catch
two
hares
at
the
same
time
very
few
dogs
have
ever
been
able
to
do
that
i
decided
to
try
to
be
a
painter
and
to
try
to
be
an
author
and
see
what
came
of
both
attempts
my
guardian
always
thought
i
should
end
by
being
an
author
and
though
she
had
no
prejudice
against
painting
she
looked
upon
it
as
a
pursuit
likely
to
be
very
tedious
at
times
to
those
who
practise
it
in
which
she
was
quite
right
it
is
generally
a
hard
struggle
requiring
infinite
patience
even
in
the
clever
and
successful
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
to
go
on
horseback
to
the
english
lake
district
in
the
summer
of
with
the
intention
of
continuing
the
journey
still
on
horseback
into
the
mountainous
regions
of
scotland
unfortunately
this
project
could
not
be
executed
with
the
horse
i
then
possessed
the
most
dangerous
sulky
resolute
and
cunning
brute
i
ever
mounted
i
rode
him
as
far
as
keswick
where
a
tried
him
and
said
his
temper
was
incurable
recommending
me
to
have
him
shot
the
advice
was
excellent
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
destroy
such
a
animal
so
i
left
him
in
grass
at
penrith
and
went
on
to
scotland
by
the
usual
means
of
travelling
a
change
that
i
regret
to
this
day
i
had
materials
with
me
for
painting
studies
in
oil
and
painted
at
windermere
and
derwentwater
it
was
an
inexpressible
pleasure
to
see
these
lakes
and
a
mental
torment
not
to
be
able
to
paint
them
better
my
first
sight
of
windermere
or
of
any
natural
lake
for
i
had
hitherto
seen
nothing
but
and
reservoirs
was
enjoyed
under
peculiarly
impressive
circumstances
i
had
been
riding
alone
or
walking
by
the
side
of
my
horse
during
the
night
and
arrived
at
the
lake
shore
by
the
guidance
of
a
star
i
wrote
down
my
first
impression
next
day
and
have
kept
the
words
i
could
not
find
the
way
to
the
little
harbor
of
bowness
and
so
went
on
for
a
considerable
distance
till
i
came
to
a
gate
which
as
i
knew
from
the
position
of
the
north
star
would
lead
directly
to
the
lake
across
the
fields
there
was
a
small
and
scarcely
traceable
footpath
and
a
board
to
warn
trespassers
however
i
fastened
the
horse
to
the
gate
and
proceeded
i
soon
arrived
at
the
shore
and
was
overawed
by
a
scene
of
overpowering
magnificence
the
day
was
just
dawning
the
water
mirrored
the
isles
except
where
the
mist
floated
on
its
surface
and
wreathed
round
their
bases
the
trees
were
massed
by
it
into
domes
and
towers
that
seemed
to
float
on
the
cloudy
lake
as
if
by
enchantment
the
stars
were
growing
pale
in
the
yellowing
east
the
distant
hills
were
coldly
blue
till
far
away
lake
and
hill
and
sky
melted
into
cloud
opposite
i
saw
the
dark
form
of
an
island
rising
between
me
and
the
other
shores
strongly
relieved
against
the
mist
which
crept
along
the
base
of
the
opposite
mountain
and
almost
clambered
to
its
dark
summit
the
reflection
of
the
dark
upper
part
of
the
mountain
which
rose
clear
of
the
mist
fell
on
the
lake
in
such
a
manner
as
to
enclose
that
of
the
island
in
another
direction
an
island
was
gradually
throwing
off
its
white
robe
of
mist
and
the
light
showed
through
the
interstices
of
the
foliage
that
i
had
taken
for
a
crag
i
had
a
pistol
with
me
and
tried
the
echo
though
it
seemed
wrong
to
disturb
a
silence
so
sublime
i
fired
and
had
time
to
regret
that
there
was
no
echo
before
a
peal
of
musketry
came
from
the
nearer
hills
and
then
a
fainter
peal
from
the
distance
followed
by
an
audible
rejoinder
this
is
the
kind
of
travel
for
the
enjoyment
of
natural
beauty
one
should
be
either
quite
alone
or
have
a
single
companion
of
the
same
tastes
and
one
should
be
above
all
commonplace
considerations
about
hours
samuel
palmer
often
walked
the
whole
night
alone
for
the
pleasure
of
observing
the
beautiful
changes
between
sunset
and
sunrise
in
the
evening
there
was
a
fine
red
sunset
followed
by
moonlight
so
i
took
a
boat
and
rowed
out
in
the
moonlight
alone
this
first
experience
of
lake
scenery
was
an
enchantment
and
it
had
a
great
influence
on
my
future
life
by
giving
me
a
passion
for
lakes
or
by
increasing
the
passion
that
in
some
inexplicable
way
i
had
felt
for
them
from
childhood
one
of
the
earliest
poems
i
had
attempted
to
compose
began
with
the
stanza
a
cold
and
chilly
mist
broodeth
winandermere
and
the
cloud
hath
kissed
the
still
lake
drear
i
had
already
tried
to
paint
lake
scenery
in
copying
a
picture
and
my
favorite
illustrations
in
the
abbotsford
edition
of
scott
works
were
the
lochs
that
i
was
now
to
see
for
the
first
time
after
a
night
at
ambleside
i
saw
rydal
water
in
sunshine
and
calm
with
faint
breezes
playing
on
its
surface
and
rode
on
to
keswick
through
the
vale
of
john
the
only
way
in
which
it
was
possible
to
ride
the
brute
i
possessed
was
in
putting
him
behind
a
carriage
which
he
followed
as
if
he
had
been
tied
to
it
in
this
manner
i
reached
keswick
after
apologizing
to
a
family
party
for
dogging
their
carriage
so
closely
as
soon
as
the
vehicle
came
to
a
stop
opposite
the
hotel
my
horse
turf
threw
out
his
heels
vigorously
in
the
crowd
luckily
he
hurt
nobody
but
the
bystanders
told
me
that
one
of
his
shoes
had
been
within
six
inches
of
a
young
lady
face
a
vicious
horse
is
a
perpetual
anxiety
turf
kicked
in
the
stable
as
well
as
out
of
it
and
hit
a
groom
on
the
forehead
a
few
days
later
the
man
would
probably
have
been
killed
without
the
leather
of
his
cap
finding
an
artist
at
keswick
pettitt
i
asked
his
advice
and
became
his
pupil
for
a
few
days
i
climbed
skiddaw
during
the
night
with
one
of
pettitt
sons
who
was
a
geologist
and
a
also
when
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
we
were
enveloped
in
a
thick
mist
which
remained
till
we
descended
but
i
lay
down
in
my
waterproof
on
the
lee
side
of
the
cairn
and
slept
in
happy
oblivion
of
discomfort
pettitt
lessons
were
of
some
use
to
me
but
as
all
my
serious
education
hitherto
had
been
classical
i
was
not
sufficiently
advanced
in
practical
art
to
prepare
me
for
color
and
i
ought
to
have
been
making
studies
of
light
and
shade
in
sepia
there
was
nothing
more
difficult
in
those
days
than
for
a
young
gentleman
to
become
an
artist
because
no
human
being
would
believe
that
he
could
be
serious
in
such
an
intention
as
i
had
a
horse
in
the
stable
at
the
hotel
pettitt
of
course
took
me
for
an
amateur
and
only
attempted
to
communicate
the
superficial
dexterity
that
amateurs
usually
desire
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
constantly
attempting
what
was
far
too
difficult
for
me
in
art
and
not
to
find
any
one
ready
and
willing
to
put
me
on
the
right
path
i
was
very
well
able
already
to
make
studies
in
sepia
that
would
have
been
valuable
material
for
future
reference
whereas
my
oil
studies
were
perfectly
worthless
and
much
more
inconvenient
and
embarrassing
i
was
enchanted
with
the
lake
district
seeing
windermere
derwentwater
and
ulleswater
besides
several
minor
lakes
but
although
i
delighted
in
all
inland
waters
and
the
lake
district
was
so
near
to
my
own
home
i
never
revisited
it
the
reason
was
that
after
seeing
the
grander
highlands
of
scotland
i
became
spoiled
for
the
english
lakes
there
was
another
reason
the
absence
of
human
interest
on
the
english
lakes
except
of
a
quite
modern
kind
there
being
no
old
castles
on
shore
or
island
lyulph
tower
on
ulleswater
though
immortalized
by
wordsworth
is
nothing
but
a
modern
nevertheless
i
have
often
regretted
that
i
did
not
become
more
familiar
with
country
in
my
youth
the
mention
of
lyulph
tower
reminds
me
that
when
i
landed
there
after
a
hard
pull
of
seven
miles
against
a
strong
wind
i
was
kindly
invited
to
take
part
in
a
merry
picnic
that
was
just
being
held
there
by
some
farmers
of
the
neighborhood
a
very
pretty
girl
asked
me
to
dance
and
i
afterwards
played
the
fiddle
the
scene
with
the
dancers
in
the
foreground
on
the
green
sward
and
the
lake
and
mountains
in
the
distance
was
one
of
the
most
poetical
i
ever
beheld
turf
had
been
ridden
from
keswick
to
penrith
by
the
already
mentioned
and
with
infinite
difficulty
i
would
have
left
him
in
the
breaker
hands
but
he
refused
to
mount
again
saying
that
he
had
done
enough
for
his
credit
and
so
had
i
for
mine
by
his
advice
i
took
the
same
resolution
and
as
nobody
in
penrith
would
ride
the
brute
he
was
left
to
grow
still
wilder
in
a
green
field
whilst
i
went
on
to
scotland
by
the
train
i
had
a
cousin
at
greenock
who
was
learning
to
be
a
marine
constructing
engineer
he
was
a
young
man
of
remarkable
ability
who
afterwards
distinguished
himself
in
his
profession
and
might
no
doubt
have
made
a
large
fortune
if
his
habits
had
not
been
imprudent
and
unsettled
at
that
time
he
was
tied
to
greenock
by
an
engagement
with
one
of
the
great
firms
where
he
was
articled
he
had
rooms
in
a
quiet
street
and
offered
me
hospitality
one
day
i
came
in
unexpectedly
and
found
a
baby
in
my
bed
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
very
pretty
girl
with
dark
eyes
came
and
took
the
baby
away
with
an
apology
i
immediately
said
to
myself
my
cousin
has
been
privately
married
that
pair
of
dark
eyes
has
cost
him
his
liberty
and
that
child
is
an
infantine
relation
of
mine
this
discovery
remained
a
long
time
a
secret
in
my
own
breast
and
i
affected
a
complete
absence
of
suspicion
during
the
rest
of
my
stay
at
greenock
but
it
was
afterwards
fully
confirmed
my
cousin
had
in
fact
married
at
the
early
age
of
nineteen
when
he
was
still
an
articled
pupil
with
caird
and
living
on
an
allowance
from
his
father
whom
he
dared
not
ask
for
an
increase
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
eke
out
his
means
by
teaching
mechanical
drawing
in
the
evenings
but
though
his
marriage
had
been
an
imprudence
it
was
not
a
folly
he
had
in
fact
shown
excellent
judgment
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
the
dark
eyes
were
not
all
behind
them
there
was
a
soul
full
of
the
most
cheerful
courage
the
sweetest
affection
the
most
faithful
devotion
for
years
my
cousin
wife
followed
him
everywhere
and
bore
his
roving
propensity
with
wonderful
good
humor
what
that
propensity
was
the
reader
may
partly
realize
when
i
tell
him
that
in
those
years
my
cousin
went
through
removals
some
of
them
across
the
greatest
distances
that
are
to
be
found
upon
the
planet
the
only
reason
why
he
did
not
remove
to
all
the
different
planets
one
after
another
was
the
absence
of
a
road
to
them
this
tendency
of
my
cousin
orme
had
been
predicted
by
a
french
phrenologist
at
manchester
when
he
was
a
boy
the
phrenologist
had
said
after
examining
his
bumps
that
orme
would
settle
in
a
place
for
a
short
time
and
appear
satisfied
at
first
as
if
it
were
for
good
but
that
very
soon
afterwards
he
would
go
elsewhere
and
repeat
the
process
i
never
met
with
any
other
human
being
who
had
such
an
unsettled
disposition
the
consequence
was
that
he
often
quitted
places
where
he
was
extremely
prosperous
and
people
who
not
only
appreciated
his
extraordinary
talents
but
were
ready
to
reward
them
handsomely
in
order
to
go
he
knew
not
whither
and
undertake
he
knew
not
what
i
left
greenock
by
an
early
steamer
for
glasgow
and
remember
this
one
detail
of
the
voyage
the
morning
air
was
brisk
and
keen
so
i
was
not
sorry
to
breakfast
when
the
meal
was
announced
and
did
ample
justice
to
it
with
a
young
and
vigorous
appetite
having
eaten
my
third
poached
egg
and
feeling
still
ready
for
the
more
substantial
dishes
that
awaited
me
i
suddenly
recollected
that
i
had
already
disposed
of
an
ample
scotch
breakfast
at
my
cousin
can
anything
more
conclusively
prove
the
wonderful
virtue
of
early
hours
and
the
healthy
northern
air
after
visiting
glasgow
and
the
falls
of
clyde
in
drenching
rain
i
saw
loch
lomond
which
was
my
first
experience
of
a
highland
lake
and
therefore
memorable
for
me
the
gradual
approach
on
the
steamer
towards
the
mountains
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
was
a
revelation
of
highland
scenery
the
day
happened
to
be
one
of
rapidly
changing
effects
a
rugged
hill
with
its
bosses
and
crags
was
one
minute
in
brilliant
light
to
be
in
shade
the
next
as
the
massive
clouds
flew
over
it
and
the
colors
varied
from
pale
blue
to
dark
purple
and
brown
and
green
with
that
wonderful
freshness
of
tint
and
vigor
of
opposition
that
belong
to
the
wilder
landscapes
of
the
north
from
that
day
my
affections
were
conquered
as
the
steamer
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
colossal
gates
of
the
mountains
and
the
deep
waters
of
the
lake
narrowed
in
the
contracting
glen
i
felt
in
my
heart
a
sort
of
exultation
like
the
delight
of
a
young
horse
in
the
first
sense
of
freedom
in
the
boundless
pasture
the
next
sunrise
i
saw
from
the
top
of
ben
lomond
but
will
spare
the
reader
the
description
it
was
a
delight
beyond
words
for
an
enthusiastic
young
reader
of
scott
to
look
upon
loch
katrine
at
last
thousands
of
tourists
have
been
drawn
to
the
same
scenes
by
their
interest
in
the
same
poet
yet
few
of
them
i
fancy
had
in
the
same
degree
with
myself
the
three
passions
for
literature
for
nature
and
for
art
if
little
has
come
of
these
passions
it
was
certainly
not
from
any
want
of
intensity
in
but
in
consequence
of
certain
critical
influences
that
will
be
explained
later
i
will
only
say
in
this
place
that
if
the
passion
for
art
had
been
strongest
of
the
three
the
productive
result
would
have
been
greater
from
tarbet
on
loch
lomond
i
went
to
inverary
and
the
first
thing
i
did
there
was
to
hire
a
and
go
beating
to
windward
on
loch
fyne
i
made
a
sketch
of
the
ruined
castle
of
dundera
which
stands
between
the
road
and
the
loch
on
a
pretty
rocky
promontory
for
some
time
i
had
a
strong
fancy
for
this
castle
and
wanted
to
rent
it
on
lease
and
restore
three
or
four
rooms
in
it
for
my
own
use
the
choice
would
have
been
in
some
respects
wiser
than
that
i
afterwards
made
as
dundera
has
such
easy
access
to
inverary
by
a
perfectly
level
and
good
road
on
the
water
edge
and
by
the
water
itself
but
the
scenery
of
loch
fyne
is
not
as
attractive
as
that
of
loch
awe
and
there
is
always
a
certain
inevitable
dreariness
about
a
loch
which
to
my
feeling
would
make
it
depressing
for
long
residence
i
had
travelled
from
tarbet
with
a
rather
elderly
couple
who
were
very
kind
to
me
and
afterwards
invited
me
to
their
house
in
yorkshire
the
lady
was
connected
with
sir
james
ross
the
arctic
discoverer
and
her
husband
had
been
a
friend
of
theodore
hook
of
whom
he
told
me
many
amusing
anecdotes
they
were
both
most
amiable
cheerful
people
and
we
formed
a
merry
party
of
three
when
first
i
saw
loch
awe
as
the
carriage
descended
the
road
from
inverary
to
cladich
on
the
way
to
dalmally
as
i
kept
a
journal
of
this
tour
i
find
easily
the
account
of
my
first
boating
on
loch
awe
it
was
in
the
month
of
august
when
we
had
come
to
a
halt
at
cladich
in
the
afternoon
i
made
a
sketch
of
the
bridge
taken
from
the
ravine
it
occupied
me
four
hours
as
the
scene
was
of
the
most
elaborate
character
we
dined
at
four
and
then
strolled
to
the
lake
which
was
at
some
distance
two
boats
were
lying
in
a
small
stream
which
emptied
itself
into
the
lake
so
i
pressed
one
of
them
into
my
service
and
was
soon
out
upon
the
water
the
boat
was
old
badly
built
and
rickety
the
starboard
oar
was
cracked
and
the
port
oar
had
been
broken
in
two
and
mended
with
bands
of
iron
the
bottom
was
several
inches
deep
in
water
the
thwarts
were
not
securely
fastened
nor
were
they
at
right
angles
to
the
keel
out
in
the
loch
the
waves
were
high
and
the
crazy
craft
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
the
water
in
her
washing
from
side
to
side
however
i
reached
the
island
called
it
was
a
striking
scene
around
me
were
the
tombs
of
many
generations
in
the
far
distance
the
dark
ruin
of
kilchurn
was
reduced
almost
to
insignificance
by
its
background
of
rugged
hills
towering
into
the
clouds
night
was
coming
on
quickly
as
i
rowed
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
little
river
on
reaching
the
inn
i
found
that
the
people
were
getting
anxious
about
me
this
first
row
on
loch
awe
has
a
pathetic
interest
for
me
to
this
day
it
was
like
one
first
meeting
with
a
friend
who
was
destined
to
become
very
dear
and
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
on
the
whole
current
of
one
life
as
my
first
impression
of
london
had
been
this
is
a
place
an
englishman
ought
to
see
once
but
i
will
never
come
to
it
again
so
my
first
impression
about
loch
awe
was
a
profound
sort
of
melancholy
happiness
in
the
place
and
a
longing
to
revisit
it
i
never
afterwards
quitted
loch
awe
without
the
same
longing
to
return
and
i
have
never
seen
any
place
in
the
world
that
inspired
in
me
that
nostalgia
in
anything
like
an
equal
degree
there
is
an
affinity
between
persons
and
places
but
the
loch
awe
that
won
my
affection
exists
no
longer
what
delighted
me
was
the
complete
unity
of
character
that
prevailed
there
the
lonely
magnificent
mountains
the
vast
expanse
of
water
only
crossed
occasionally
by
some
poor
open
boat
the
melancholy
ruins
on
island
or
peninsula
the
wilderness
the
sadness
the
pervading
sense
of
solitude
a
solitude
peopled
only
with
traditions
of
a
romantic
past
it
was
almost
as
lonely
as
some
distant
lake
in
the
wilds
of
canada
that
the
indian
crosses
in
his
canoe
yet
its
ruined
castles
gave
a
poetry
that
no
american
waters
can
ever
possess
such
was
loch
awe
that
i
loved
with
the
melancholy
affection
of
youth
before
the
experience
of
life
had
taught
me
a
more
active
and
practical
philosophy
than
the
indulgence
in
the
sweet
sadness
of
these
reveries
but
loch
awe
of
and
of
the
future
is
as
modern
and
practical
as
the
that
open
upon
the
clyde
on
my
first
visit
in
there
was
neither
steamer
nor
now
there
are
fourteen
steamers
on
the
lake
four
of
them
public
and
the
railway
trains
pass
round
the
skirts
of
cruachan
and
rush
through
the
brandir
pass
there
is
a
big
hotel
they
tell
me
just
opposite
kilchurn
from
which
place
by
express
train
you
can
get
to
edinburgh
in
four
hours
the
day
after
our
arrival
at
loch
awe
turned
out
to
be
most
beautiful
a
fine
day
in
the
highlands
seems
by
contrast
far
more
beautiful
than
elsewhere
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
enchantment
of
the
head
of
loch
awe
as
our
carriage
slowly
descended
the
hilly
road
from
cladich
towards
dalmally
stopping
frequently
for
me
to
look
and
sketch
when
we
got
near
the
island
or
peninsula
of
innistrynich
with
its
dark
green
oaks
and
of
a
brighter
green
in
the
sunshine
and
gray
rocks
coming
down
into
the
calm
dark
water
it
seemed
to
my
northern
taste
the
realization
of
an
earthly
paradise
i
have
lived
upon
it
since
and
unwillingly
left
it
and
to
this
day
i
have
the
most
passionate
affection
for
it
and
often
dream
about
it
painfully
or
pleasurably
the
most
painful
dream
of
all
being
that
it
has
been
spoiled
by
the
present
owner
which
happily
is
quite
the
contrary
of
the
truth
i
went
to
oban
on
the
top
of
the
coach
in
the
most
brilliant
weather
that
ever
is
or
can
be
alternate
sunshine
and
rain
with
white
clouds
of
a
dazzling
brightness
under
this
enchantment
the
barren
land
of
lorne
seemed
beautiful
and
one
forgot
its
poverty
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
waters
of
loch
etive
then
a
pale
blue
stretching
far
inland
and
the
distant
hills
of
morven
were
or
seemed
to
be
of
the
purest
azure
when
my
new
friends
had
left
me
at
oban
i
hired
a
and
two
men
for
a
voyage
amongst
the
western
isles
but
as
she
was
an
open
boat
the
men
did
not
like
the
idea
of
risking
our
lives
in
her
on
the
exposed
waters
of
the
atlantic
so
the
voyage
was
confined
to
the
sound
of
mull
and
i
crossed
the
island
to
its
western
shore
on
foot
that
voyage
left
permanent
recollections
of
grand
effects
and
wild
scenery
of
the
kind
afterwards
described
by
william
black
in
his
macleod
of
dare
as
we
sailed
across
the
sound
in
the
evening
from
oban
to
auchincraig
the
sky
was
full
of
torn
flying
swiftly
and
catching
the
lurid
hues
from
the
sunset
whilst
the
distant
mountains
and
cliffs
of
mull
were
of
that
dark
purple
which
seems
melancholy
and
funereal
in
landscape
though
it
is
one
of
the
richest
colors
in
the
world
it
was
dangerous
weather
for
sailing
being
very
squally
and
in
the
year
i
knew
nothing
about
the
management
of
but
the
men
were
not
imprudent
and
after
coasting
under
the
cliffs
of
mull
we
landed
at
auchincraig
where
at
that
time
there
was
a
miserable
inn
the
next
day
we
had
a
glorious
sail
up
the
sound
to
the
bay
of
aros
stopping
only
to
see
duart
castle
in
walking
across
the
island
to
loch
na
keal
we
passed
through
a
most
picturesque
camp
that
would
have
delighted
landseer
there
were
hundreds
of
horses
and
innumerable
dogs
of
the
picturesque
northern
breeds
it
was
the
market
of
mull
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
sight
of
ulva
as
we
sat
on
the
shore
of
mull
waiting
for
the
ulva
lay
a
great
dark
mass
under
the
crimson
west
reflected
in
a
glassy
sea
we
had
already
seen
staffa
and
iona
pale
in
the
distant
atlantic
then
the
boat
fetched
us
and
we
floated
as
in
a
poet
dream
till
the
worst
of
inns
brought
one
back
to
a
sense
of
reality
the
boatman
who
accompanied
me
whose
name
was
andrew
amused
himself
by
telling
lies
to
the
credulous
inhabitants
of
ulva
and
one
of
his
inventions
was
that
i
was
going
to
purchase
the
island
the
other
boatman
donald
slept
in
the
boat
at
salan
wrapped
up
in
a
sail
the
return
voyage
to
oban
is
thus
described
in
my
journal
a
fine
young
man
asked
me
for
a
seat
in
the
boat
which
i
granted
on
condition
that
he
would
perform
his
share
of
the
work
a
favorable
wind
carried
us
well
over
fifteen
miles
half
our
distance
and
the
rest
had
to
be
rowed
the
sun
set
in
crimson
and
the
crescent
moon
arose
behind
the
blue
hills
of
mull
over
the
dark
tower
of
duart
the
scene
was
shortly
a
festival
of
lights
with
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
water
brilliantly
phosphorescent
so
that
the
oar
seemed
to
drip
with
fire
lastly
when
we
entered
the
smooth
bright
bay
of
oban
a
crescent
of
lights
shone
around
it
reflected
in
columns
of
flame
upon
the
surface
these
were
my
chief
experiences
of
the
west
highlands
during
that
first
tour
and
they
left
what
i
believe
to
be
an
indelible
impression
for
to
this
day
i
remember
quite
distinctly
under
what
kind
of
effect
each
of
these
scenes
presented
itself
the
artistic
results
of
the
tour
consisted
of
sketches
in
oil
and
pencil
quite
without
value
except
to
remind
me
of
the
scenes
passed
through
and
of
the
most
decidedly
amateur
character
i
also
wrote
a
journal
interesting
to
me
now
for
the
minute
details
it
contains
which
bring
the
past
back
to
me
very
vividly
but
utterly
without
literary
merit
the
wonder
is
how
a
youth
with
so
little
manifest
talent
as
may
be
found
in
these
sketches
and
journal
could
indulge
in
any
artistic
or
literary
ambition
my
impression
is
that
the
dull
year
of
heavy
work
that
i
had
gone
through
with
the
yorkshire
tutor
had
done
positive
harm
to
me
besides
this
i
was
living
intellectually
in
great
solitude
my
guardian
was
very
kind
and
she
was
a
woman
of
sterling
good
sense
but
she
knew
nothing
about
the
fine
arts
nor
could
she
afford
me
much
guidance
in
my
reading
her
own
reading
being
limited
to
the
bible
and
to
some
english
and
french
classics
my
uncles
were
both
extremely
reserved
men
who
did
not
encourage
my
questions
so
i
was
left
for
a
while
to
get
on
without
other
intellectual
assistance
than
that
afforded
by
books
my
eldest
uncle
the
owner
of
hollins
said
one
day
to
my
guardian
buy
him
the
britannica
it
will
prevent
him
from
asking
so
many
questions
so
she
made
the
purchase
which
gave
me
a
large
pasture
at
least
for
facts
and
as
for
good
literature
my
little
library
was
beginning
to
be
well
stocked
i
made
no
attempt
at
that
time
to
keep
up
my
latin
and
greek
nor
did
i
work
seriously
at
painting
but
read
drew
and
wrote
very
much
as
it
happened
not
subjecting
myself
to
any
rigorous
discipline
yet
never
remaining
unoccupied

our
the
grand
paying
off
the
men
on
january
i
began
to
keep
a
journal
and
continued
it
with
some
intermissions
till
june
the
journal
is
long
and
minute
in
detail
and
affords
me
a
very
clear
retrospect
of
my
life
in
those
years
but
it
will
be
needless
to
trouble
the
reader
with
quotations
from
it
the
title
page
of
the
diary
is
a
clear
indication
of
my
pursuits
it
is
called
an
account
of
time
spent
in
literature
art
music
and
gymnastics
the
reader
may
observe
that
literature
comes
before
art
so
that
if
i
am
now
an
author
rather
than
an
artist
the
reason
may
be
found
in
early
studies
and
inclination
music
and
gymnastics
were
in
my
view
only
a
part
of
general
culture
yet
of
considerable
importance
in
their
way
as
a
scheme
of
this
seems
sufficiently
comprehensive
and
to
this
day
i
feel
the
good
effects
of
it
my
reading
was
not
badly
chosen
the
drawing
gave
some
initiation
into
art
and
exercise
developed
physical
activity
not
yet
altogether
lost
in
mature
age
still
the
experienced
reader
will
see
at
a
glance
that
this
was
not
the
training
of
a
young
painter
who
in
a
craft
of
such
great
technical
difficulty
and
in
an
age
of
such
intense
competition
must
give
himself
up
more
completely
to
his
own
special
pursuit
on
the
first
page
of
this
diary
i
find
an
entry
about
an
article
for
the
westminster
review
i
offered
two
or
three
papers
to
the
westminster
which
were
declined
and
then
i
wrote
to
the
editor
asking
him
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
explain
for
my
own
benefit
and
guidance
what
were
the
reasons
for
their
rejection
his
answer
came
and
was
both
kind
and
judicious
an
article
he
told
me
ought
to
be
an
organic
whole
with
a
order
and
proportion
amongst
its
parts
there
ought
to
be
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
this
was
a
very
good
and
lesson
for
at
that
time
i
had
no
notion
of
a
synthetic
of
parts
there
was
no
doubt
another
reason
which
the
editor
omitted
out
of
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
a
literary
aspirant
who
was
too
young
and
too
insufficiently
informed
to
write
anything
that
could
interest
readers
of
the
westminster
i
worked
rather
hard
at
writing
english
verse
and
do
not
at
the
present
time
regret
a
single
hour
of
that
labor
my
general
habit
was
to
write
a
poem
sometimes
of
considerable
length
and
then
destroy
it
but
i
kept
some
of
these
compositions
which
were
afterwards
published
in
a
volume
was
good
for
me
at
that
time
for
a
particular
reason
i
did
not
understand
the
art
of
prose
composition
which
is
much
less
obvious
than
that
of
poetry
but
being
already
aware
that
was
an
art
approached
it
in
the
right
spirit
which
is
that
of
ungrudging
labor
and
incessant
care
the
value
or
of
the
result
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
the
essential
point
is
that
verse
was
to
me
a
discipline
coming
just
at
a
time
of
life
when
i
had
much
need
of
a
discipline
besides
the
mind
of
a
young
man
is
not
ripe
enough
in
reflection
or
rich
enough
in
knowledge
to
supply
substantial
and
prose
but
the
freshness
and
keenness
of
his
feelings
may
often
give
life
enough
to
a
few
stanzas
if
not
to
a
longer
poem
it
may
be
objected
to
this
advocacy
of
verse
that
as
the
poet
gift
is
excessively
rare
the
probability
is
that
a
youth
who
writes
verse
attacks
an
art
that
he
can
never
master
no
doubt
the
highest
degree
of
the
poetic
gift
is
most
rare
and
so
according
to
christine
nilsson
are
the
gifts
needed
to
make
a
yet
many
a
girl
practises
singing
without
hoping
to
be
a
nilsson
and
there
are
many
poets
in
the
world
whose
verses
have
melody
and
charm
though
their
brows
may
never
be
cooled
with
laurel
the
objection
to
verse
as
a
trifling
occupation
comes
really
from
that
general
disinclination
to
read
verse
which
excuses
itself
by
the
rarity
of
genius
rossetti
who
had
genius
in
his
own
person
was
always
ready
to
appreciate
good
poetical
work
that
had
no
fame
to
recommend
it
footnote
since
the
above
was
written
i
have
met
with
an
address
delivered
by
walter
besant
the
novelist
in
which
he
recommends
the
continuous
practice
of
versification
as
a
discipline
in
the
use
of
language
most
valuable
to
writers
of
prose
in
the
way
of
art
at
this
time
i
painted
three
portraits
and
some
landscapes
that
were
merely
studies
it
is
needless
to
enumerate
these
attempts
all
of
no
value
and
generally
destroyed
afterwards
an
important
event
occurred
on
march
being
in
manchester
i
bought
the
first
volume
of
ruskin
modern
painters
in
this
way
i
came
under
the
influence
of
ruskin
and
remained
under
it
more
or
less
for
several
years
it
was
a
good
influence
in
two
ways
first
in
literature
as
anything
that
ruskin
has
to
say
is
sure
to
be
well
expressed
and
after
that
it
was
a
good
influence
in
directing
my
attention
to
certain
qualities
and
beauties
in
nature
but
in
art
this
influence
was
not
merely
evil
it
was
disastrous
i
was
however
at
that
time
just
the
young
man
predestined
to
fall
under
it
being
very
fond
of
reading
and
having
a
strong
passion
for
natural
beauty
in
the
course
of
the
year
i
corresponded
with
ruskin
about
my
studies
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
perfect
sincerity
of
his
advice
and
the
kindness
of
intention
with
which
it
was
given
but
it
tended
directly
to
encourage
the
idea
that
art
could
be
learned
from
nature
and
that
is
an
immense
mistake
nature
does
not
teach
art
or
anything
resembling
it
she
only
provides
materials
art
is
a
product
of
the
human
mind
the
slow
growth
of
centuries
if
you
reject
this
and
go
to
nature
you
have
to
begin
all
over
again
the
objection
being
that
one
human
life
is
not
long
enough
for
that
as
it
is
possible
that
some
critic
may
say
that
ruskin
influence
was
not
so
much
opposed
to
the
tradition
of
art
as
i
am
representing
it
to
be
and
considering
that
i
shall
be
dead
when
this
is
published
i
quote
the
following
passage
from
a
memorandum
found
amongst
the
papers
of
leitch
the
painter
and
printed
in
his
biography
i
knew
a
young
man
of
talent
ardent
and
energetic
and
anxious
to
be
a
who
went
to
ruskin
and
asked
his
advice
as
to
what
he
should
do
what
school
he
should
follow
how
he
should
practise
and
what
master
he
should
put
himself
under
i
was
told
that
the
answer
he
got
was
to
this
effect
nothing
to
do
with
schools
put
yourself
under
no
master
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
useless
as
soon
as
you
can
draw
a
tree
or
a
tower
or
a
rock
in
an
ordinary
way
that
is
sufficient
take
your
materials
then
out
to
nature
and
paint
in
school
it
is
the
only
school
i
know
of
where
you
ca
go
wrong
i
had
asked
ruskin
to
recommend
me
some
in
london
with
whom
i
could
study
for
six
months
his
answer
was
there
is
no
artist
in
london
capable
of
teaching
you
and
at
the
same
time
willing
to
give
lessons
all
those
who
teach
teach
mere
tricks
with
the
brush
not
true
art
far
less
true
nature
he
then
recommended
me
to
go
to
william
turner
of
oxford
not
for
six
months
but
for
six
weeks
i
was
prevented
from
following
this
advice
by
a
technical
difficulty
turner
of
oxford
was
a
painter
i
had
learned
with
two
masters
but
had
never
liked
it
or
felt
the
slightest
impulse
to
continue
it
one
man
is
naturally
constituted
for
one
process
another
for
another
there
is
something
in
my
idiosyncrasy
repugnant
to
the
practice
of
and
favorable
to
oil
and
this
in
spite
of
the
greater
convenience
of
and
the
facility
with
which
it
may
be
left
off
and
instantaneously
resumed
in
i
learned
a
third
time
with
a
very
able
artist
and
now
i
am
able
to
paint
studies
in
that
medium
from
nature
which
are
truthful
enough
and
people
seem
to
like
them
but
hitherto
i
have
had
no
enjoyment
whatever
in
the
work
the
reader
will
please
understand
that
this
implies
no
want
of
appreciation
of
the
art
when
it
is
skilfully
practised
by
others
there
are
certain
instruments
of
music
that
one
may
listen
to
with
pleasure
without
having
the
slightest
desire
to
perform
upon
them
footnote
my
estimate
of
the
rank
of
amongst
the
fine
arts
has
steadily
risen
as
the
true
technical
relations
of
the
graphic
arts
have
become
clearer
to
me
is
quite
as
great
an
art
as
fresco
whilst
it
is
incomparably
more
convenient
this
being
so
the
reader
will
understand
how
i
felt
about
going
to
william
turner
of
oxford
hour
for
hour
i
would
as
willingly
have
read
greek
as
practise
washes
not
to
trouble
ruskin
however
any
further
with
my
affairs
i
tried
to
induce
several
to
accept
me
as
a
pupil
but
always
met
with
the
same
answer
that
they
did
not
teach
it
was
rather
a
matter
of
pride
in
those
days
for
a
successful
painter
to
decline
to
give
lessons
it
proved
him
to
be
above
the
grade
of
a
on
march
a
little
event
occurred
which
was
one
of
the
numerous
causes
that
turned
me
aside
from
the
steady
practice
of
art
one
of
our
friends
called
about
the
impending
establishment
of
the
militia
and
offered
to
use
his
influence
with
colonel
towneley
to
get
a
commission
for
me
in
the
royal
lancashire
the
regiment
that
was
to
have
its
headquarters
at
burnley
my
guardian
much
wished
me
to
accept
and
i
did
so
to
please
her
as
i
had
not
been
able
to
please
her
by
going
to
oxford
there
was
nothing
in
a
military
life
even
for
a
short
time
every
year
that
had
the
slightest
attraction
for
me
the
notion
of
rendering
a
patriotic
service
did
not
occur
to
me
for
nobody
in
those
days
looked
upon
the
militia
seriously
we
were
only
laughed
at
for
our
pains
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
hard
work
in
getting
the
regiment
including
ourselves
into
something
distantly
resembling
military
order
before
we
were
called
up
for
training
i
got
some
initiation
with
a
line
regiment
our
colonel
was
the
representative
of
a
very
old
catholic
family
the
towneleys
of
towneley
this
family
had
been
skilful
enough
to
avoid
shipwreck
during
the
contests
that
attended
the
establishment
of
protestantism
in
england
it
had
survived
in
increasing
wealth
and
prosperity
and
had
now
reached
the
calm
haven
of
a
civilized
age
with
tolerant
and
liberal
institutions
everything
promised
a
long
continuance
the
head
of
the
family
had
no
male
heir
but
his
brother
john
who
was
a
major
in
our
regiment
had
one
son
a
cousin
of
roger
tichborne
and
on
this
son
the
hopes
of
continuance
rested
those
hopes
have
not
been
realized
the
young
man
died
in
his
youth
his
father
and
his
uncle
also
died
the
property
is
divided
amongst
three
heiresses
and
now
for
the
first
time
since
surnames
were
invented
there
is
no
longer
a
towneley
of
towneley
the
colonel
was
a
man
of
the
kindest
disposition
and
the
most
gentle
manners
without
much
confidence
in
himself
for
all
regimental
matters
he
trusted
the
adjutant
captain
fenton
an
officer
who
had
seen
much
active
service
in
india
fenton
had
by
nature
the
gifts
of
a
ruler
of
men
when
not
on
duty
he
was
as
gentle
as
a
lady
a
pleasant
and
amiable
talker
but
on
the
he
ruled
us
all
like
a
napoleon
he
had
lost
one
eye
people
always
believed
in
battle
but
in
fact
the
loss
had
occurred
in
a
since
his
return
from
india
the
other
eye
seemed
to
have
gained
in
consequence
a
supernatural
degree
of
penetration
it
looked
you
through
one
day
on
the
that
eye
glared
at
me
in
such
a
manner
that
i
was
quite
intimidated
and
said
what
i
had
to
say
in
rather
a
low
tone
of
voice
speak
up
sir
you
thundered
the
adjutant
mister
hamerton
i
tell
you
to
speak
up
fenton
had
an
extremely
pretty
little
bay
horse
that
had
been
in
a
circus
so
when
he
rode
past
the
companies
on
parade
and
the
band
struck
up
the
horse
used
to
begin
dancing
keeping
time
beautifully
and
indeed
danced
all
the
way
from
company
to
company
this
used
to
put
fenton
out
of
temper
and
as
soon
as
ever
military
usages
permitted
it
he
would
stop
the
band
with
a
gesture
even
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
in
fact
no
matter
at
what
moment
to
such
of
us
as
had
a
musical
disposition
this
was
perhaps
as
difficult
to
hear
as
the
dancing
of
fenton
horse
could
be
to
him
footnote
we
had
a
major
who
did
not
much
like
the
band
and
when
he
could
stop
it
he
would
say
tell
that
band
to
hold
its
tongue
during
our
first
training
there
were
not
billets
enough
in
burnley
to
lodge
all
our
men
so
one
company
had
to
be
sent
to
padiham
and
mine
was
selected
i
was
a
lieutenant
and
had
neither
captain
nor
ensign
being
quite
alone
as
a
commissioned
officer
but
we
possessed
an
excellent
old
sergeant
who
had
seen
active
service
and
of
course
he
taught
me
what
to
do
my
mess
consisted
of
a
solitary
dinner
in
the
inn
at
padiham
sufficient
but
not
luxurious
my
guardian
had
wished
me
to
go
into
the
militia
to
live
rather
more
with
young
gentlemen
and
my
only
society
was
that
of
the
old
sergeant
who
punctiliously
observed
the
difference
of
rank
on
account
of
the
distance
from
padiham
to
burnley
rather
more
than
three
miles
we
were
excused
the
early
parade
but
went
through
the
two
others
the
consequence
was
that
at
the
end
of
the
training
although
we
had
marched
more
than
the
other
companies
we
had
had
only
of
their
drill
and
when
the
grand
inspection
by
a
general
took
place
it
was
thought
advisable
to
hide
my
company
and
another
that
was
also
weak
in
drill
though
for
a
different
reason
luckily
there
was
a
sort
of
dell
in
the
and
we
were
ordered
to
march
down
into
it
there
we
stood
patiently
in
line
during
the
whole
time
of
the
review
and
the
inspecting
general
never
looked
at
us
which
was
what
the
colonel
desired
being
destitute
of
military
ambition
i
was
quite
contented
to
remain
down
in
the
hollow
the
most
modest
and
obscure
positions
are
sometimes
the
most
agreeable
we
had
a
major
who
had
been
a
colonel
in
the
guards
it
was
whispered
that
he
did
not
know
very
much
about
drill
having
probably
forgotten
his
acquirements
one
day
however
he
commanded
the
regiment
and
i
ventured
to
ask
him
a
question
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
the
commanding
officer
was
like
the
grand
llama
of
thibet
he
could
not
be
approached
directly
but
only
through
the
adjutant
my
belief
was
and
is
that
my
question
puzzled
him
for
he
was
far
too
not
to
have
answered
it
at
once
if
he
had
been
able
i
told
the
story
to
my
brother
officers
who
were
amused
by
the
comparison
with
the
grand
llama
and
we
sometimes
called
the
major
by
that
title
afterwards
as
a
perfectly
inexperienced
young
officer
without
anybody
but
an
old
and
sergeant
to
help
him
and
a
number
of
drunken
irishmen
in
the
company
to
vex
and
trouble
him
by
day
and
by
night
i
had
as
much
to
do
during
the
first
training
as
could
be
expected
of
a
youth
in
my
situation
the
last
day
of
the
training
i
committed
the
blunder
of
advancing
small
sums
of
money
to
a
number
of
men
who
of
course
immediately
got
drunk
my
ignorance
of
popular
manners
and
customs
had
made
me
unable
to
realize
the
lamentable
fact
that
if
you
pay
five
shillings
to
a
man
in
the
improvident
class
he
will
at
once
invest
it
in
five
shillings
worth
of
intoxication
i
was
still
in
padiham
at
two
in
the
afternoon
finishing
accounts
and
i
had
to
be
in
burnley
with
my
men
in
time
to
get
them
off
by
the
evening
trains
when
we
started
many
of
them
were
so
drunk
that
they
could
not
walk
and
i
requisitioned
a
number
of
empty
carts
and
so
got
the
drunken
portion
of
the
company
to
headquarters
then
there
came
the
final
settlement
of
more
than
eighty
separate
accounts
without
the
adjutant
fenton
i
should
never
have
got
through
it
he
was
a
methodical
man
who
understood
the
business
he
got
a
quantity
of
small
change
piled
it
in
separate
heaps
upon
a
table
had
each
man
brought
up
before
him
and
said
authoritatively
so
much
is
owing
to
you
there
it
is
in
this
way
we
got
through
the
payments
and
the
drunken
men
were
lodged
in
prison
for
the
night
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
my
quiet
literary
and
artistic
occupations
and
my
country
home
we
had
been
so
busy
during
our
first
training
and
i
had
been
so
much
separated
from
the
other
officers
by
my
duty
at
padiham
that
so
far
as
society
was
concerned
i
might
almost
as
well
have
been
on
the
top
of
pendle
hill
besides
that
englishmen
are
slow
to
associate
they
are
shy
and
they
look
at
each
other
a
long
time
before
getting
really
acquainted

my
most
intimate

if
there
is
any
good
in
an
autobiography
it
ought
to
be
as
an
example
or
a
warning
to
others
so
at
the
risk
of
seeming
to
moralize
which
however
is
far
from
my
intention
i
will
say
something
in
this
place
about
my
manner
of
life
in
those
days
first
with
regard
to
art
it
was
not
my
fault
if
all
the
painters
i
had
applied
to
said
that
they
did
not
take
pupils
there
was
a
young
gentleman
in
our
neighborhood
who
though
a
rich
man
son
worked
seriously
at
painting
and
put
himself
every
year
under
the
direction
of
a
french
artist
in
paris
where
he
studied
in
an
atelier
i
had
an
idea
of
joining
him
but
my
guardian
who
with
all
her
sweetness
of
disposition
could
be
authoritative
when
she
liked
put
a
stop
to
the
project
by
saying
that
she
refused
her
consent
to
any
plan
involving
absence
from
england
before
the
expiration
of
my
minority
she
had
the
usual
english
idea
that
paris
is
a
more
immoral
place
than
london
perhaps
it
may
be
but
great
capitals
such
as
paris
london
and
vienna
have
this
in
common
that
you
may
be
moral
in
them
or
immoral
as
you
like
and
if
we
are
to
avoid
a
town
because
immorality
is
practised
there
we
must
avoid
all
the
great
and
most
of
the
smaller
centres
of
intelligence
for
the
present
i
worked
from
nature
but
not
with
sufficient
energy
or
regularity
i
had
not
found
my
path
and
was
always
dissatisfied
with
my
studies
in
literature
my
reading
was
abundant
and
included
the
best
english
poets
and
essayists
i
had
entirely
given
up
reading
latin
and
greek
at
that
time
and
was
not
just
then
studying
any
modern
language
in
their
place
young
men
both
and
their
own
gifts
they
do
not
know
themselves
as
indeed
how
should
they
i
had
an
impression
that
nature
had
not
endowed
me
with
a
gift
for
languages
this
impression
was
not
only
erroneous
but
the
exact
contrary
of
the
truth
for
i
am
a
born
linguist
my
life
in
general
was
healthy
and
active
it
included
a
great
deal
of
walking
exercise
sometimes
five
hours
in
a
day
this
with
bathing
kept
me
in
fair
health
though
i
never
had
what
is
called
robust
health
that
which
allows
its
possessor
to
commit
great
imprudences
with
impunity
i
was
once
near
losing
life
altogether
by
an
odd
result
from
a
small
accident
my
horse
which
was
a
heavy
and
large
animal
put
his
foot
accidentally
on
mine
the
accident
did
not
prevent
me
from
riding
out
on
the
moors
but
when
i
got
there
the
pain
became
so
violent
that
i
held
my
foot
in
a
cold
rivulet
during
the
night
the
pain
returned
and
then
i
foolishly
plunged
the
foot
into
a
cold
bath
the
result
was
that
the
inflammation
flew
to
the
throat
and
i
had
a
quinsy
which
nearly
carried
me
off
i
remember
asking
for
everything
by
writing
on
a
slate
and
the
intense
longing
i
had
for
lemonade
my
most
intimate
friend
in
those
days
was
a
young
solicitor
in
burnley
a
man
of
remarkable
ability
and
naturally
polished
manners
his
professional
duties
did
not
leave
him
very
much
time
for
reading
but
he
had
a
mind
far
above
the
common
philistinism
that
can
not
appreciate
literature
i
must
have
wearied
him
sadly
sometimes
by
reading
my
own
verses
always
a
most
foolish
thing
to
do
and
at
this
day
quite
remote
from
my
notions
of
an
author
dignity
handsley
was
wisely
indifferent
to
literary
fame
and
never
wrote
anything
himself
except
his
letters
which
were
those
of
a
man
of
business
he
took
upon
himself
great
labors
and
great
responsibilities
which
ripened
his
faculties
at
a
very
early
age
and
he
bore
them
with
uncommon
firmness
and
prudence
i
never
met
with
his
superior
in
the
practical
sense
that
seizes
upon
opportunities

in
the
energy
which
arrives

opportunity

was
always
one
of
those
to
whom
opportunity
is

if
his
career
had
been
in
parliament
i
am
convinced
that
he
would
have
risen
high
his
merits
were
exactly
those
that
are
most
valued

the

of

who

never
to
visit
london
again
went
there
to
see
the
royal

exhibition
and
of
course
found
it
closed
if
any
one
could
have
seen
me
before
the

knowing
that
i
had
come
all
the
way
from
lancashire
in
the
expectation
of
finding
them
open
he
might
have
derived
some
innocent
mirth
from
my
disappointment
the
royal
academy
being
no
longer
accessible
i
turned
into
the
national
gallery
and
at
once
began
to
take
notes
in
a
this
seems
to
have
been
my
habit
at
that
time
i
took
notes
about
everything
about
painting
architecture
and
even
the
royal
mews
the
notes
are
copious
and
wordy
though
destitute
of
literary
merit
they
certainly
serve
their
purpose
for
they
recall
things
vividly
enough
even
in
detail
nothing
of
any
importance
is
omitted
although
notes
of
that
kind
are
unreadable
they
are
very
useful
afterwards
for
reference
and
my
time
could
scarcely
have
been
better
spent
i
find
i
gave
five
hundred
words
to
the
description
of
building
of
carthage
and
other
pictures
are
treated
with
equal
liberality
i
carried
the
same
laborious
system
of
even
into
exhibitions
in
later
life
one
learns
the
art
of
doing
such
work
more
briefly
having
purchased
a
few
prints
for
study
i
returned
to
lancashire
and
resumed
my
strict
division
of
time
four
hours
a
day
were
given
to
practical
drawing
but
not
invariably
the
entry
is
sometimes
three
or
two
only
when
art
lost
an
hour
literature
gained
it
either
in
study
or
practical
writing
i
was
curiously
accurate
in
my
accounts
of
time
and
knew
to
what
was
spent
on
this
pursuit
or
that
here
is
an
extract
in
evidence
of
this
tendency
thursday
august
determined
to
study
the
copper
albert
d√ºrer
hours
having
given
to
the
i
have
already
given
the
copper
hours
so
that
i
have
to
devote
to
it
yet
i
shall
also
give
hours
to
kreutzer
violin
studies
and
have
already
practised
them
which
leaves
i
shall
now
commence
a
course
of
poetical
reading
beginning
with
hours
of
chaucer
and
as
i
gave
him
last
night
it
leaves
me
exactly
this
is
carrying
exactness
to
excess
and
it
is
not
given
as
an
example
to
be
followed
but
it
had
the
advantage
of
letting
me
know
how
my
time
expenditure
was
running
in
this
way
it
became
clear
that
if
i
intended
to
be
an
artist
the
time
given
to
practical
work
was
insufficient
as
no
painter
of
eminence
would
take
a
pupil
i
bethought
me
of
pettitt
who
had
given
me
lessons
at
keswick
he
consented
to
take
me
but
said
that
he
had
left
the
north
of
england
for
london
in
the
lake
district
he
had
been
earning
a
small
income
in
london
he
earned
twice
as
much
but
his
expenses
increased
in
proportion
the
change
however
was
a
disappointment
to
me
as
it
would
have
been
more
profitable
to
study
from
nature
under
my
master
direction
than
to
copy
pictures
in
a
london
studio
my
new
london
life
began
at
the
end
of
december
it
has
always
been
in
my
case
an
effort
little
short
of
heroic
to
go
and
stay
in
a
town
at
all
my
dislike
to
towns
increases
in
exact
mathematical
proportion
to
their
size
the
notion
of
going
to
london
to
study
seemed
against
nature
the
negotiations
with
pettitt
had
been
begun
with
the
hope
of
a
return
to
derwentwater
however
one
dark
and
drizzly
evening
in
december
i
found
myself
seeking
the
number
my
new
master
had
given
me
in
percy
street
he
was
not
there
that
was
his
studio
only
the
house
was
in
the
suburbs
we
met
on
the
following
morning
in
the
studio
where
stood
an
enormous
picture
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
golden
image
this
was
conceived
on
the
principles
of
john
martin
with
prodigious
perspectives
of
impossible
architecture
and
the
price
was
a
thousand
pounds
the
labor
involved
was
endless
but
the
whole
enterprise
was
vain
and
futile
from
beginning
to
end
pettitt
could
work
honestly
and
laboriously
from
nature
indeed
he
never
stinted
labor
in
anything
but
such
a
large
undertaking
as
this
piece
of
mingled
archaeology
and
art
was
alike
beyond
his
knowledge
and
outside
the
range
of
his
imagination
he
was
not
to
blame
except
for
an
error
of
judgment
the
demand
for
his
work
was
feeble
and
uncertain
so
he
thought
it
necessary
to
attract
attention
by
a
sensation
picture
to
finish
the
history
of
this
work
without
recurring
to
it
i
have
only
to
add
that
it
proved
in
all
ways
financially
and
otherwise
a
failure
pettitt
was
a
most
devoted
student
of
nature
and
his
best
pictures
had
the
character
of
faithful
studies
he
would
sit
down
in
some
rocky
dell
by
the
side
of
a
stream
in
wales
and
paint
rocks
and
trees
month
after
month
with
indefatigable
perseverance
but
he
had
no
education
either
literary
or
artistic
and
very
little
imaginative
power
his
only
safety
was
in
that
work
from
nature
and
he
would
have
stuck
to
it
most
resolutely
had
there
been
any
regularity
in
the
encouragement
he
received
but
his
income
like
that
of
all
painters
who
are
not
celebrated
was
very
uncertain
and
he
could
not
quietly
settle
down
to
the
tranquil
studies
that
he
loved
anxiety
had
made
him
imprudent
it
had
driven
him
to
try
for
notoriety
the
nebuchadnezzar
picture
and
other
mistakes
of
a
like
magnitude
were
the
struggles
of
a
disquieted
mind
pettitt
had
a
very
large
family
to
maintain
and
did
nothing
but
paint
paint
from
morning
till
night
except
for
after
his
light
lunch
when
he
read
the
times
as
the
great
picture
did
not
advance
very
rapidly
he
worked
by
gaslight
after
the
short
london
winter
day
and
often
pursued
his
terrible
task
till
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
exhausted
nature
could
resist
no
longer
and
be
fell
asleep
on
a
little
iron
bed
in
the
studio
there
were
days
when
he
told
me
he
had
worked
twenty
hours
out
of
the
all
this
was
a
perfectly
gratuitous
expenditure
of
time
and
health
that
could
not
possibly
lead
to
any
advantage
whatever
pettitt
was
a
very
kind
and
attentive
teacher
and
his
method
was
this
he
would
begin
a
picture
in
my
presence
give
me
two
white
canvases
exactly
the
same
size
and
then
tell
me
to
copy
his
hour
work
twice
over
whilst
he
painted
i
watched
whilst
i
painted
he
did
not
look
over
me
but
went
on
with
his
own
work
he
was
always
ready
to
answer
any
question
and
to
help
me
over
any
difficulty
in
this
way
he
soon
initiated
me
into
the
processes
of
so
far
as
i
required
any
initiation
for
most
of
them
were
familiar
to
me
already
unfortunately
pettitt
had
no
conception
of
art
this
needs
a
short
explanation
as
the
reader
may
allowably
ask
how
a
man
without
any
conception
of
art
could
be
even
a
moderately
successful
artist
the
answer
is
that
men
like
pettitt
regard
painting
simply
as
a
representation
of
nature
and
their
pictures
are
really
nothing
but
large
and
laborious
studies
pettitt
was
a
most
sincere
lover
of
nature
but
that
was
all
he
knew
little
or
nothing
of
those
necessities
and
conditions
that
make
art
a
different
thing
from
nature
the
tendency
of
his
teaching
was
therefore
to
lead
me
to
nature
instead
of
leading
me
to
art
and
this
was
a
great
misfortune
for
me
as
my
instincts
were
only
too
much
in
the
same
direction
already
i
could
get
nature
in
the
country
and
that
in
endless
abundance
what
i
needed
at
that
time
was
some
guidance
into
the
realm
of
art
pettitt
taught
me
to
draw
in
a
hard
clear
scientific
manner
he
himself
knew
a
little
geology
and
one
of
his
sons
was
a
geologist
i
copied
studies
of
cliffs
that
were
entirely
conceived
and
executed
in
the
scientific
spirit
the
ideas
of
artistic
synthesis
of
seeing
a
subject
as
a
whole
of
subordination
of
parts
of
concentration
of
vision
of
obtaining
results
by
opposition
in
form
light
and
shade
and
color
all
those
ideas
were
foreign
to
my
master
simple
philosophy
of
art
in
his
view
the
artist
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
down
to
a
natural
subject
and
copy
with
the
utmost
diligence
what
was
before
him
first
one
part
and
then
another
till
the
whole
was
done
my
master
therefore
only
confirmed
me
in
my
own
tendencies
which
were
to
turn
my
back
on
art
and
go
to
nature
as
the
sole
authority
ruskin
influence
had
impelled
me
in
the
same
direction
every
one
is
the
product
of
his
time
and
of
his
teachers
it
is
not
my
fault
if
the
essentially
artistic
elements
in
art
were
hidden
from
me
in
my
youth
had
i
perceived
them
at
that
time
they
would
only
have
seemed
a
kind
of
dishonesty
if
pettitt
had
written
an
autobiography
it
would
have
been
extremely
interesting
he
was
the
child
of
his
father
and
five
were
born
after
him
he
began
by
being
apprenticed
to
a
but
did
not
take
to
the
work
and
was
put
into
a
then
he
served
an
apprenticeship
to
a
japanner
and
married
very
early
on
incredibly
small
earnings
which
however
he
increased
by
his
rapidity
in
work
and
his
incessant
industry
before
the
expiration
of
his
apprenticeship
he
had
a
shop
of
his
own
and
sold
japanned
and
bellows
when
he
was
able
to
rent
a
house
he
made
all
the
furniture
with
his
own
hands
and
took
a
pride
in
having
it
very
good
either
solid
mahogany
or
veneered
he
saved
money
in
the
japanning
business
and
then
on
these
savings
undertook
to
teach
himself
painting
his
earliest
works
were
sold
for
anything
they
would
fetch
whilst
i
was
in
london
he
recognized
one
of
them
a
small
picture
that
he
immediately
bought
back
for
sixpence
there
had
been
a
fall
in
its
market
value
alas
for
the
original
price
was
ninepence
pettitt
had
a
fancy
for
collecting
his
early
daubs
as
they
confirmed
his
sense
of
progress
having
acquired
some
knowledge
of
painting
he
engaged
himself
on
weekly
wages
as
a
decorator
of
steamboat
panels
his
employers
wanted
quantity
rather
than
finish
but
pettitt
liked
to
finish
as
well
as
he
could
and
recommended
his
to
study
from
nature
this
led
to
his
dismissal
during
the
time
of
his
poverty
pettitt
made
an
excursion
into
france
and
being
at
paris
with
a
companion
as
penniless
as
himself
he
had
to
devise
means
for
reaching
england
without
money
the
pair
had
nothing
of
any
value
but
a
flute
and
the
flute
had
silver
keys
so
it
was
a
precious
article
with
the
proceeds
in
their
pockets
the
friends
tramped
to
boulogne
on
foot
and
there
they
arrived
in
the
last
stage
of
poverty
they
cleaned
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
before
showing
their
faces
at
the
hotel
they
had
patronized
when
richer
and
there
they
stayed
for
some
days
in
the
hope
of
a
remittance
from
an
uncle
that
relative
was
of
opinion
that
a
little
hardship
would
surely
bring
the
travellers
back
to
england
and
so
he
sent
them
nothing
what
was
to
be
done
they
avowed
the
whole
case
to
the
who
not
only
made
no
attempt
to
detain
them
but
filled
their
empty
purses
the
story
concludes
prettily
for
the
obdurate
uncle
relented
on
their
arrival
and
at
once
repaid
the
frenchman
pettitt
long
preceded
louis
stevenson
in
the
idea
of
travelling
in
france
with
a
donkey
he
too
explored
some
mountainous
districts
in
the
centre
or
south
of
france
with
a
donkey
to
carry
his
luggage
and
the
two
companions
slept
out
at
nights
as
stevenson
did
afterwards
at
last
pettitt
met
with
an
old
woman
whose
lot
seemed
to
him
particularly
hard
she
had
to
walk
from
a
down
to
the
valley
every
day
nearly
twenty
miles
going
and
returning
so
pettitt
made
her
a
present
of
his
donkey
and
she
prayed
for
him
most
fervently
another
of
my
master
pedestrian
rambles
extended
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
along
the
coast
of
great
britain
during
this
excursion
he
accumulated
a
vast
quantity
of
sketches
truthful
memoranda
almost
as
accurate
as
the
photographs
which
have
now
superseded
studies
of
that
kind
pettitt
had
made
astonishing
progress
considering
the
humble
position
he
started
from
but
unfortunately
for
me
he
was
not
a
man
of
culture
even
in
art
one
of
his
friends
a
journalist
who
often
called
at
the
studio
and
who
saw
a
little
deeper
than
most
people
said
to
me
one
day
that
the
art
of
painting
as
practised
by
many
fairly
successful
men
and
he
referred
tacitly
to
my
master
might
be
most
accurately
described
as
a
industry
for
my
part
i
worked
very
steadily
when
in
london
and
made
rapid
progress
it
was
not
quite
in
the
right
direction
unfortunately
no
reader
of
these
pages
will
be
able
to
imagine
what
a
sacrifice
that
stay
in
london
was
for
me
the
studio
was
never
cleaned
and
very
badly
ventilated
my
master
did
not
perceive
this
amidst
the
clouds
of
his
own
tobacco
smoke
but
for
me
who
had
come
from
perfect
cleanliness
and
the
pure
air
of
our
northern
hills
it
was
almost
unbearable

whom
i
knew
already
by
correspondence
mackay
author
of
the
progress
of
the
intellect
mackay
was
for
many
years
a
kind
friend
of
mine
an
incident
occurred
long
afterwards
which
put
an
end
to
this
friendship
i
made
some
reference
to
him
in
a
review
that
was
not
intended
to
be
unkind
or
depreciatory
in
any
way
as
i
always
felt
a
deep
respect
for
mackay
but
unhappily
he
saw
it
in
another
light
and
so
it
ended
our
intercourse
in
and
for
long
afterwards
there
was
nothing
to
foreshadow
a
rupture
of
this
kind
and
i
am
still
able
to
write
of
my
old
friend
as
if
he
had
always
remained
so
mackay
was
primarily
a
scholar
and
secondarily
an
artist
he
had
been
educated
at
cambridge
and
being
gifted
with
an
extraordinary
memory
he
accumulated
learning
in
very
abundant
stores
as
to
his
memory
it
is
said
that
he
once
accepted
a
challenge
to
recite
a
thousand
lines
of
virgil
and
did
it
without
error
he
had
a
good
practical
knowledge
of
french
and
german
he
possessed
a
large
collection
of
sketches
made
during
his
travels
in
italy
and
elsewhere
work
of
a
kind
that
an
amateur
might
judiciously
practise
as
there
was
no
false
finish
about
them
they
recalled
scenes
that
had
interested
him
either
by
their
natural
beauty
which
he
appreciated
or
by
association
with
classical
literature
i
hardly
like
to
use
the
word
gentleman
because
it
is
employed
in
so
many
different
senses
but
i
never
knew
anybody
who
realized
my
conception
of
that
ideal
more
perfectly
than
mackay
in
him
as
prince
leopold
said
of
another
all
culture
and
all
refinement
met
he
was
extremely
simple
in
all
his
ways
and
averse
to
every
kind
of
vanity
and
ostentation
he
had
a
sufficient
fortune
for
a
refined
life
and
did
not
care
for
any
kind
of
wasteful
extravagance
all
belonging
to
him
was
simple
and
in
good
taste
he
did
not
see
very
much
society
that
which
he
did
see
included
several
men
and
women
of
distinguished
ability
mackay
chief
pursuit
was
one
to
which
i
would
never
have
devoted
laborious
years
theology
on
the
negative
side
his
idea
was
that
the
liberation
of
thought
could
only
be
accomplished
by
going
painfully
over
the
whole
theological
ground
and
every
belief
and
phase
of
belief
historically
and
rationally
my
opinion
was
and
is
that
all
this
trouble
is
superfluous
the
true
liberation
must
come
from
the
enlargement
of
the
mind
by
wider
and
more
accurate
views
of
the
natural
universe
as
this
takes
place
the
mediaeval
beliefs
must
drop
away
of
themselves
and
we
now
see
that
this
process
is
actually
in
operation
so
far
from
devoting
a
life
to
the
refutation
of
theological
error
i
would
not
bestow
upon
such
an
unnecessary
and
thankless
toil
the
labor
of
a
week
or
a
day
the
habit
of
study
and
reflection
had
done
mackay
some
harm
in
one
respect
it
had
withdrawn
him
too
much
from
commonplace
reality
he
always
seemed
to
be
moving
in
a
dream
and
to
recall
himself
to
the
actual
world
by
an
effort
this
is
a
result
of
excessive
culture
that
i
have
observed
in
other
cases
my
conclusion
is
that
all
the
culture
in
the
world
all
the
learning
all
the
literary
skill
and
taste
put
together
are
not
so
well
worth
having
as
the
keen
and
clear
sense
of
present
reality
that
common
folks
have
by
nature
mackay
was
a
laborious
and
careful
writer
and
he
had
a
good
style
of
its
kind
though
it
was
more
remarkable
for
strength
and
soundness
than
for
vivacity
and
ease
it
was
too
much
of
one
texture
to
be
attractive
and
so
he
never
became
a
popular
author
of
course
the
heterodoxy
of
mackay
opinions
was
one
great
cause
of
his
failure
to
catch
the
public
ear
in
england
but
even
that
difficulty
can
be
got
over
by
a
great
literary
artist
he
tried
to
do
his
best
as
to
literary
form
but
he
never
condescended
to
write
for
the
market
in
any
way
and
used
to
maintain
that
if
a
book
was
to
be
profitable
it
be
written
for
the
market
i
do
not
quite
agree
with
this
opinion
i
should
say
rather
that
literature
resembles
painting
in
being
one
of
the
fine
arts
and
that
when
a
book
like
a
picture
is
a
fine
work
of
art
it
has
a
great
chance
of
being
a
commercial
success
renan
books
have
been
very
successful
literary
speculations
because
renan
is
a
artist
mackay
would
have
been
a
better
artist
in
literature
if
he
had
not
been
so
much
overpowered
by
the
immense
masses
of
his
materials
amongst
the
new
friends
i
gained
at
mackay
house
was
leslie
the
painter
i
was
charmed
with
him
from
the
first
and
retain
to
this
day
the
liveliest
recollection
of
his
exquisitely
urbane
manners
and
even
of
the
tones
of
his
voice
leslie
was
a
man
of
unquestionable
genius
but
entirely
free
from
the
tendency
to
despise
other
people
which
so
often
accompanies
genius
on
first
meeting
with
him
i
took
him
for
a
clergyman
and
told
him
of
it
later
he
felt
rather
flattered
than
otherwise
by
the
mistake
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
modest
nature
would
at
once
refer
to
points
on
which
the
average
clergyman
would
probably
be
his
superior
some
artists
are
lost
in
admiration
of
their
own
works
so
that
the
way
to
please
them
is
to
praise
what
they
have
done
themselves
but
the
way
to
please
leslie
was
to
praise
what
constable
had
done
his
admiration
for
constable
was
quite
as
strong
a
passion
as
ruskin
admiration
of
turner
though
it
did
not
express
itself
in
such
perfervid
language
i
might
at
that
time
have
become
constable
pupil
indirectly
leslie
would
have
educated
me
in
the
art
of
that
master
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
work
by
myself
copying
studies
and
pictures
by
constable
in
a
studio
of
my
own
within
a
short
distance
of
leslie
house
and
he
would
have
come
to
me
often
to
advise
robinson
the
eminent
strongly
urged
me
to
put
myself
under
leslie
direction
and
this
i
believe
was
the
kind
indirect
way
of
offering
it
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
wish
to
hurt
pettitt
by
leaving
him
and
constable
choice
of
quiet
rural
subjects
was
to
me
at
that
time
uninteresting
i
disliked
tame
scenery
not
having
as
yet
the
artistic
perceptions
which
are
needed
for
the
appreciation
of
it
leslie
introduced
me
to
constable
family
who
were
very
kind
and
they
showed
me
all
the
sketches
of
his
that
remained
in
their
possession
my
love
for
precise
and
definite
drawing
made
me
unable
to
see
the
real
merits
of
those
studies
though
i
was
not
much
mistaken
in
thinking
that
drawing
of
the
quality
i
then
cared
for
was
not
to
be
found
in
them
constable
was
essentially
what
the
french
understand
by
the
word
that
is
an
artist
who
studies
the
aspects
of
common
nature
broadly
he
would
have
done
me
much
good
at
that
time
if
i
had
felt
interested
in
him
but
the
lover
of
the
western
highlands
could
not
bring
himself
to
care
for
the
fields
and
hedgerows
about
flatford
pettitt
at
any
rate
loved
our
lake
district
and
wales
again
though
i
had
a
hearty
and
just
admiration
for
leslie
unrivalled
power
of
painting
expression
in
the
faces
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
i
had
never
seen
any
landscape
by
him
except
tame
backgrounds
which
seemed
to
me
quite
secondary
as
they
were
i
had
at
that
time
a
mistaken
belief
derived
originally
from
ruskin
and
confirmed
by
pettitt
that
there
was
something
essentially
meritorious
in
bestowing
great
labor
on
a
work
of
art
it
is
well
for
an
artist
to
be
habitually
industrious
because
that
increases
his
skill
but
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
this
or
that
picture
has
cost
much
or
little
labor
provided
that
the
artist
has
clearly
expressed
what
he
desired
robinson
the
gave
me
a
good
lesson
on
this
subject
we
were
looking
at
a
drawing
by
millais
in
indian
ink
which
was
penned
all
over
in
minute
hatchings
i
was
full
of
admiration
for
the
industry
of
the
artist
but
robinson
thought
it
labor
thrown
away
i
met
ruskin
personally
one
evening
and
we
examined
a
by
john
lewis
which
was
on
a
the
drawing
was
fortunately
glazed
for
as
ruskin
was
holding
the
candle
over
it
the
composite
dropped
on
the
glass
he
pointed
out
the
minute
beauties
of
a
camel
eye
which
was
painted
so
carefully
that
even
the
hairs
of
the
eyelash
were
given
and
the
reflections
on
the
mirror
of
the
eye
this
praise
of
minute
detail
was
at
that
time
only
too
much
in
accordance
with
my
own
taste
i
had
an
intense
admiration
for
such
feats
of
skilled
industry
as
the
wonderful
lattices
that
lewis
used
to
paint
with
the
eastern
sunshine
streaming
through
them
on
a
variety
of
different
surfaces
i
met
john
lewis
himself
he
was
a
man
with
a
beard
which
at
that
time
was
of
the
purest
silvery
white
i
afterwards
had
the
advantage
of
a
little
correspondence
with
lewis
he
wrote
well
and
expressed
his
opinions
about
very
clearly
in
his
letters
they
amounted
chiefly
to
this
work
always
as
much
from
nature
as
possible
and
give
all
the
care
you
can
at
that
time
i
had
a
settled
scheme
for
going
to
travel
and
work
in
egypt
and
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
than
scotland
on
account
of
the
greater
sameness
of
the
effects
i
mentioned
this
project
to
ruskin
who
said
that
he
avoided
travelling
in
countries
where
he
could
not
be
sure
of
ordinary
comforts
such
as
a
white
and
a
clean
knife
and
fork
still
he
would
put
up
with
a
great
deal
of
inconvenience
to
be
near
a
mountain
talking
of
turner
paintings
in
comparison
with
his
he
said
he
would
rather
have
half
the
drawings
than
all
the
oil
pictures
he
compared
a
drawing
of
nemi
with
an
oil
picture
that
we
could
see
at
the
same
time
two
works
almost
of
the
same
date
and
gave
reasons
for
preferring
the
my
egyptian
scheme
brought
me
into
relations
with
bonomi
who
at
that
time
was
a
famous
traveller
bartlett
the
whose
works
had
been
very
widely
spread
abroad
by
engraving
told
me
that
when
he
was
ill
of
a
fever
at
baalbec
he
was
nursed
by
a
sheik
who
wore
a
beard
and
rode
an
arab
horse
this
sheik
spoke
english
and
was
in
fact
bonomi
who
had
adopted
the
manners
of
the
wandering
arabs
and
would
have
remained
amongst
them
if
his
english
friends
had
not
persuaded
him
to
return
bonomi
was
one
of
the
liveliest
little
men
i
ever
met
i
feel
almost
guilty
of
a
fraud
with
regard
to
him
for
his
amiability
towards
me
was
due
in
great
part
to
his
belief
of
my
statement
that
i
was
going
to
egypt
yet
i
never
went
there
and
shall
certainly
not
go
now
my
only
excuse
is
that
i
sincerely
believed
the
same
statement
myself
he
said
that
the
effects
of
color
and
light
in
egypt
at
morning
and
evening
were
perfectly
inconceivable
he
recommended
me
to
travel
not
on
the
nile
itself
but
on
the
bank
with
camels
as
that
gave
a
greatly
superior
view
both
of
the
country
and
the
river
samuel
sharpe
was
a
charming
straightforward
old
gentleman
who
said
what
he
thought
without
any
feeble
concession
to
other
opinions
he
did
not
share
the
prevalent
enthusiasm
for
turner
which
was
of
course
in
great
part
factitious
as
many
of
the
people
who
praised
turner
so
warmly
then
had
laughed
at
his
pictures
a
few
years
before
sharpe
thought
that
turner
was
an
unsafe
guide
for
a
young
to
imitate
it
is
remarkable
as
a
matter
of
fact
how
little
practical
influence
turner
has
had
upon
the
progress
of
landscape
art
another
and
a
stronger
proof
of
the
independence
of
judgment
was
his
opinion
about
england
and
russia
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
oppose
russia
progress
towards
constantinople
by
force
but
thought
there
was
room
enough
for
the
two
empires
without
collision
if
sharpe
opinion
had
prevailed
there
would
have
been
no
crimean
war
but
he
and
those
who
thought
with
him
were
very
much
isolated
at
that
time
i
met
at
his
house
a
cousin
of
miss
martineau
who
told
us
some
good
stories
especially
about
tennyson
on
this
a
brother
of
our
host
said
that
he
was
once
travelling
when
he
met
with
a
party
of
tourists
among
whom
he
recognized
the
laureate
who
that
gentleman
said
they
he
has
been
the
life
and
soul
of
our
party
and
we
can
not
get
a
clue
to
his
name
for
he
has
baffled
us
in
every
way
tearing
it
off
his
luggage
and
out
of
the
book
he
was
reading
sharpe
betrayed
the
secret
not
much
to
the
laureate
satisfaction
when
travelling
in
scotland
some
time
afterwards
i
myself
met
with
tennyson
so
a
tourist
kindly
explained
who
he
was
in
these
words
that

a
visit
to
his
geniality
in
sir
walter
leslie
picture
the
rape
of
the
lock
george
robert
his
nautical
watkiss
richard
doyle
leslie
took
me
one
afternoon
to
see
old
rogers
the
poet
when
we
arrived
he
was
out
for
a
drive
so
we
quietly
examined
the
works
of
art
in
the
house
until
his
return
the
interest
of
that
house
was
quite
peculiar
to
itself
even
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
had
been
unaltered
for
years
and
as
the
rooms
just
as
we
saw
them
had
been
visited
by
most
people
of
note
during
nearly
two
generations
they
had
an
interest
from
association
with
famous
names
that
could
not
be
rivalled
at
that
time
by
any
other
rooms
in
london
the
for
example
was
exactly
in
the
same
state
as
when
byron
dined
there
and
would
eat
nothing
but
a
biscuit
leslie
said
i
have
seen
siddons
sitting
on
the
corner
of
that
sofa
near
the
fire
and
walter
scott
walk
up
to
her
and
shake
hands
leslie
mentioned
many
other
celebrities
but
none
of
them
were
so
interesting
to
me
as
the
authors
of
waverley
and
childe
harold
many
of
the
material
objects
about
us
had
a
history
of
their
own
a
stand
that
carried
an
antique
vase
had
been
carved
by
chantrey
when
a
young
unknown
and
so
had
the
sideboard
as
chantrey
reminded
rogers
long
afterwards
when
he
was
received
as
a
guest
in
the
same
room
the
fender
and
ceiling
had
been
designed
by
flaxman
the
panels
of
a
cabinet
had
been
painted
by
stothard
we
went
upstairs
to
see
some
pictures
in
rogers
bedroom
in
itself
a
very
simple
homely
place
with
the
old
man
flannels
warming
before
the
fire
the
picture
in
that
room
which
pleased
me
most
was
a
subject
borrowed
from
raphael
by
leslie
a
lady
teaching
her
boy
to
read
but
it
was
treated
freely
by
leslie
from
other
models
the
boy
was
his
son
george
the
future
academician
when
young
he
had
already
begun
to
be
as
we
were
examining
this
picture
rogers
returned
from
his
drive
and
received
us
in
the
he
said
hamerton
i
think
seen
you
before
but
i
said
he
was
mistaken
so
he
held
out
his
hand
and
went
on
well
then
i
very
glad
to
see
you
now
especially
so
well
introduced
have
you
been
all
over
the
house
you
have
the
honor
of
knowing
a
very
distinguished
artist
look
at
that
picture
on
the
sideboard
of
the
poor
babes
in
the
tower
do
you
like
it
i
think
it
is
beautiful
beautiful
nobody
ought
to
be
able
to
look
at
such
a
picture
without
shedding
tears
see
the
light
on
the
heads
oh
it
is
beautiful
then
he
began
to
ramble
a
little
but
soon
came
back
to
realities
and
invited
leslie
to
dine
the
next
day
and
meet
two
distinguished
friends
i
rather
have
you
by
yourself
he
added
you
and
i
could
do
very
well
without
the
others
this
was
the
rogers
of
senile
as
was
natural
at
the
age
of
years
and
eight
months
yet
still
retaining
much
of
the
old
rogers
hospitable
sometimes
caustic
sometimes
pathetic
and
always
a
true
lover
and
appreciator
of
the
fine
arts
leslie
declared
him
to
be
the
only
amateur
who
had
knowledge
enough
to
form
a
good
collection
without
assistance
i
dined
with
leslie
the
same
day
and
the
talk
turned
upon
the
poets
leslie
said
that
the
virtue
of
geniality
was
of
great
value
to
a
poet
and
that
if
byron
had
possessed
the
geniality
of
goldsmith
he
would
have
been
as
great
a
poet
as
shakespeare
but
that
his
misanthropy
spoiled
all
his
views
of
life
in
saying
this
leslie
probably
underestimated
the
literary
value
of
much
of
intensity
and
force
is
due
to
the
energy
of
malevolence
the
success
of
ruskin
earlier
writings
was
due
in
part
to
the
same
cause
in
periodical
literature
it
was
pure
that
first
made
the
saturday
review
successful
talking
of
talfourd
who
had
lately
died
on
the
bench
leslie
said
that
he
was
a
high
liver
and
that
led
him
to
give
an
account
of
sir
walter
scott
way
of
life
at
dinner
he
would
eat
heartily
of
many
dishes
and
drink
a
variety
of
wines
at
dessert
he
drank
port
and
last
of
all
a
servant
brought
him
a
small
wooden
bowl
full
of
neat
whiskey
which
he
drank
off
he
then
either
wrote
or
talked
till
midnight
and
refreshed
himself
with
a
few
glasses
of
porter
before
going
to
bed
leslie
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
scott
was
intemperate
for
a
man
of
a
robust
constitution
who
took
a
great
deal
of
exercise
but
only
that
like
talfourd
he
was
a
high
liver
it
is
remarkable
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
scott
own
habits
that
eating
and
drinking
are
so
often
and
so
minutely
described
in
his
novels
his
heroes
and
heroines
always
have
hearty
appetites
except
when
they
are
laid
up
with
illness
a
few
days
after
our
visit
to
rogers
i
went
to
see
leslie
picture
of
the
rape
of
the
lock
and
met
robinson
the
engraver
on
my
way
he
told
me
to
expect
the
finest
modern
picture
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
perfect
works
of
its
class
the
action
and
expression
of
the
sixteen
figures
were
as
lively
as
in
a
hogarth
with
more
refinement
leslie
was
completely
in
sympathy
with
queen
time
and
reproduced
it
with
unfailing
zest
and
knowledge
he
had
been
very
careful
about
details
the
interior
at
hampton
court
had
been
painted
on
the
spot
and
all
the
still
life
in
the
picture
even
to
a
fan
had
been
studied
with
equal
accuracy
leslie
mother
sat
looking
at
the
picture
and
making
the
liveliest
comments
on
the
subject
and
the
actors
she
would
get
up
without
hesitation
to
see
something
more
nearly
and
turn
round
with
perfect
balance
of
body
to
make
her
remarks
to
the
company
she
appeared
to
me
then
to
be
about
sixty
but
the
age
of
her
daughter
made
that
impossible
real
age
was
it
seemed
incredible
that
she
was
older
than
rogers
her
grandchildren
were
playfully
sarcastic
at
times
to
draw
her
out
in
argument
we
know
grandmamma
that
you
are
a
dandy
yourself
so
no
wonder
that
you
admire
the
dresses
in
the
picture
yes
yes
i
like
people
to
be
dressed
as
well
as
possible
as
well
i
mean
as
they
can
really
afford
i
like
them
to
wear
the
very
best
materials
as
tastefully
as
they
can
whilst
she
was
looking
at
the
picture
leslie
sat
down
by
her
side
and
read
the
passage
from
the
rape
of
the
lock
that
his
painting
illustrated
it
was
a
very
interesting
scene
the
master
with
his
children
about
him
and
his
wife
and
her
old
mother
all
looking
at
his
last
and
greatest
work
whilst
he
was
reading
pope
perfect
verses
so
beautifully
i
have
scarcely
mentioned
leslie
sons
yet
george
the
future
academician
was
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
in
those
days
he
was
a
clever
talker
and
he
had
the
advantage
often
precious
to
a
taciturn
companion
like
me
of
never
allowing
the
conversation
to
flag
for
a
single
instant
i
think
i
never
knew
any
one
of
the
male
sex
with
the
exception
of
francis
palgrave
who
could
keep
up
such
an
abundant
stream
of
talk
as
george
leslie
this
led
some
of
his
friends
to
think
that
he
would
never
have
any
practical
success
in
art
but
he
afterwards
proved
them
to
be
in
the
wrong
he
had
a
frank
straightforward
boyish
nature
with
a
fund
of
humor
and
a
healthy
disposition
to
be
easily
pleased
his
philosophy
of
life
under
an
appearance
of
careless
gayety
was
perhaps
in
reality
deeper
than
that
of
my
learned
friend
mackay
for
whilst
the
elderly
scholar
was
laboring
painfully
and
thanklessly
to
elucidate
the
past
the
young
artist
was
enjoying
the
present
in
his
own
way
and
looking
forward
hopefully
to
the
future
the
buoyancy
of
spirits
that
george
leslie
had
in
those
days
is
an
excellent
gift
for
a
young
artist
because
it
carries
him
merrily
over
the
difficulties
of
his
craft
his
brother
robert
was
older
and
graver
he
painted
landscape
and
marine
subjects
but
though
his
pictures
have
been
regularly
accepted
at
the
academy
he
has
had
no
popular
success
this
may
be
attributed
in
great
part
to
his
habit
of
living
away
from
london
robert
leslie
has
all
his
life
had
very
strong
nautical
instincts
and
very
likely
knows
more
about
shipping
than
any
other
artist
my
belief
is
that
one
reason
why
he
has
not
been
a
very
successful
painter
is
that
he
knows
too
much
about
nature
and
lives
too
much
in
the
presence
of
nature
which
is
always
overwhelming
and
discouraging
after
i
knew
him
in
london
robert
leslie
indulged
his
nautical
instincts
in
sailing
and
as
well
as
in
painting
marine
pictures
aided
only
by
a
single
workman
he
constructed
a
vessel
of
tons
with
this
and
other
yachts
he
has
made
himself
familiar
with
the
southern
coasts
of
england
and
has
frequently
crossed
the
atlantic
both
on
steamers
and
now
that
we
are
both
getting
elderly
men
i
heartily
regret
not
to
have
seen
more
of
robert
leslie
but
so
it
is
in
life
so
it
has
been
particularly
in
life
we
are
separated
by
distance
from
those
who
might
have
been
our
most
intimate
and
most
valued
friends
footnote
robert
leslie
had
a
literary
gift
and
wrote
some
clever
papers
which
have
been
collected
and
published
under
the
title
of
a
sea
painter
log
another
friend
gained
during
my
first
stay
in
london
was
watkiss
lloyd
who
has
given
up
many
of
the
best
years
of
his
life
to
intellectual
pursuits
he
has
been
much
devoted
to
ancient
greek
literature
and
history
and
has
studied
greek
art
with
unflagging
interest
at
the
same
time
so
that
he
possesses
an
advantage
over
most
scholars
in
knowing
both
sides
of
the
hellenic
intellect
he
has
a
manly
frank
and
generous
nature
with
cheerful
open
manners
watkiss
lloyd
is
one
of
several
superior
men
amongst
my
acquaintances
who
have
not
achieved
popularity
as
authors
the
reason
in
his
case
may
be
that
as
he
has
never
been
obliged
to
write
for
money
he
has
never
cared
to
study
the
conditions
of
success
i
told
him
once
when
we
were
talking
on
this
subject
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
most
necessary
to
have
a
clear
and
definite
idea
of
the
kind
of
public
one
is
addressing
and
that
we
ought
to
write
to
an
especial
public
as
paul
wrote
to
the
ephesians
failure
may
be
caused
by
having
confused
ideas
about
our
public
or
by
writing
only
for
ourselves
as
if
our
works
were
destined
to
remain
in
manuscript
like
a
private
journal
a
man
may
write
what
is
clear
for
himself
when
it
will
require
to
be
read
twice
or
three
times
by
another
besides
this
reason
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
constant
study
of
ancient
greek
is
not
a
good
preparation
for
popular
english
authorship
the
scholar
and
the
successful
writer
are
two
distinct
persons
they
may
be
occasionally
combined
in
one
by
accident
but
if
the
reader
will
run
over
in
his
mind
the
names
of
popular
modern
authors
he
will
find
very
few
distinguished
scholars
amongst
them
however
this
may
be
watkiss
lloyd
is
something
better
than
a
popular
author
he
is
an
intellectual
man
truly
a
lover
of
knowledge
and
of
wisdom
without
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
evils
that
are
in
the
world
he
does
not
forget
the
good
on
one
occasion
after
a
terrible
malady
that
had
occurred
to
one
dear
to
him
i
said
that
undeserved
diseases
seemed
to
me
clear
evidence
of
imperfection
in
the
universe
he
answered
that
as
we
receive
many
benefits
from
the
existing
order
of
things
that
we
have
not
merited
in
any
way
so
we
may
accept
those
evils
that
we
have
not
merited
either
this
struck
me
as
a
better
reason
for
resignation
than
the
common
assertion
that
we
are
wicked
enough
to
deserve
the
most
frightful
inflictions
we
do
not
really
believe
that
our
wickedness
deserves
cancer
or
leprosy
i
never
wished
to
push
myself
into
the
society
of
celebrated
persons
for
the
purpose
of
getting
acquainted
with
them
but
i
plead
guilty
to
that
degree
of
curiosity
which
likes
to
see
them
in
the
flesh
i
knew
landseer
by
sight
and
probably
rather
astonished
him
once
in
a
london
street
by
taking
my
hat
off
as
if
he
had
been
prince
albert
he
used
to
pass
an
evening
from
time
to
time
at
leslie
house
and
i
met
him
there
he
then
seemed
a
very
jovial
merry
english
humorist
with
a
natural
talent
for
satire
and
mimicry
but
there
was
another
side
to
his
nature
if
he
enjoyed
himself
heartily
when
in
company
he
often
suffered
from
deep
depression
when
alone
i
remember
seeing
him
by
himself
when
he
looked
the
image
of
profound
melancholy
at
that
time
i
had
warmer
admiration
for
his
art
than
i
have
now
and
the
general
public
looked
upon
him
as
the
greatest
artist
in
england
no
doubt
he
was
very
observant
and
had
a
wonderful
memory
for
animals
and
their
ways
as
well
as
some
invention
he
had
also
unsurpassable
technical
skill
of
a
superficial
kind
in
painting
harding
was
another
very
clever
artist
whom
i
met
at
leslie
i
had
correspondence
with
him
a
little
as
a
teacher
and
had
studied
his
works
he
had
taught
many
amateurs
including
ruskin
and
a
clever
friend
of
mine
in
the
north
i
admired
his
skill
but
disliked
his
extreme
artificiality
of
style
and
the
more
i
went
to
nature
the
more
objectionable
did
it
appear
to
me
the
kind
of
success
which
is
attained
by
forcing
nature
into
set
forms
never
tempted
me
in
the
least
harding
was
at
one
time
probably
the
most
successful
in
england
the
word
clever
characterizes
him
exactly
he
was
clever
in
the
art
of
substituting
himself
for
nature
clever
in
the
wonderful
facility
with
which
he
used
several
graphic
arts
technically
very
different
from
each
other
and
clever
especially
in
that
supreme
tact
of
the
successful
by
which
he
makes
the
amateur
seem
to
get
forward
rapidly
he
had
immense
confidence
in
himself
and
in
his
own
theories
and
principles
another
artist
whom
i
met
at
leslie
was
richard
doyle
he
had
great
gifts
of
wit
and
invention
with
a
curiously
small
fund
of
science
genius
without
the
knowledge
that
might
have
given
strength
to
genius
it
is
impossible
however
to
feel
any
regret
on
this
account
for
if
doyle
drawings
had
been
thoroughly
learned
they
would
have
lost
their
he
was
intelligent
enough
to
make
even
his
lack
of
science
an
element
of
success
for
he
turned
it
into
a
pretended
simplicity
his
own
face
was
mobile
and
expressive
and
it
was
evident
that
he
passed
quickly
from
one
idea
to
another
without
uttering
more
than
a
small
percentage
of
his
thoughts
i
remember
dancing
sir
roger
de
coverley
when
landseer
and
richard
doyle
were
of
the
set
they
were
both
extremely
amusing
but
with
this
difference
that
whereas
landseer
evidently
laid
himself
out
to
be
funny
in
gesture
and
action
the
fun
in
doyle
case
lay
entirely
in
the
play
of
his
physiognomy
leslie
too
had
a
most
expressive
face
not
handsome
i
mean
of
course
the
elder
leslie
his
son
george
is
handsome
but
most
interesting
and
full
of
meaning

marian

the
my
friend
william
his
brother
mead
the
mrs
rowan
and
her
a
vexatious
i
suffer
from
nostalgia
for
the
country
mackay
took
me
to
one
of
the
evening
receptions
that
were
given
at
that
time
by
john
chapman
the
publisher
on
our
way
he
spoke
of
miss
marian
evans
then
only
known
to
a
few
as
a
translator
from
the
german
and
to
still
fewer
as
a
contributor
of
articles
to
the
westminster
review
a
periodical
that
she
partly
directed
neither
the
translations
nor
the
articles
revealed
anything
beyond
good
ordinary
literary
abilities
mackay
told
me
however
that
this
miss
evans
was
a
very
accomplished
lady
and
played
remarkably
well
on
the
piano
she
was
at
chapman
little
conversazione
and
performed
for
us
i
remember
being
well
pleased
with
the
music
and
thinking
that
she
was
one
of
the
best
amateurs
i
had
heard
but
i
can
not
remember
what
she
played
nor
anything
about
her
talk
which
would
probably
be
a
series
of
little
private
conversations
with
people
that
she
already
knew
john
chapman
was
young
at
that
time
and
a
very
man
he
had
entered
upon
the
most
unprofitable
line
of
business
that
he
could
have
chosen
in
the
england
of
those
days
the
trade
in
philosophic
literature
of
the
highest
class
the
number
of
buyers
was
of
course
exceedingly
limited
both
by
the
thoughtful
character
of
the
works
published
and
by
the
unpopularity
of
the
opinions
expressed
in
them
the
marvel
is
that
such
a
speciality
in
publishing
could
be
made
to
support
itself
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
of
the
wealthier
published
their
works
or
those
of
others
at
their
own
expense
and
some
helped
to
maintain
the
westminster
review
things
have
altered
wonderfully
since
then
at
the
present
day
the
literature
of
free
inquiry
is
presented
to
the
world
by
the
richest
and
most
eminent
publishing
firms
and
have
access
to
the
most
influential
and
the
most
widely
disseminated
periodicals
some
readers
of
this
autobiography
may
still
look
upon
john
speciality
with
horror
but
such
a
feeling
would
be
unjust
the
books
he
published
were
generally
high
in
tone
and
they
certainly
never
condescended
to
the
use
of
unbecoming
language
in
dealing
with
matters
held
sacred
by
the
majority
of
the
english
people
the
only
object
of
that
modest
propaganda
was
to
win
for
englishmen
the
right
to
think
for
themselves
and
also
to
express
their
thoughts
that
battle
has
been
won
and
for
my
part
i
feel
nothing
but
respect
for
those
who
had
courage
to
confront
the
stern
intolerance
of
the
past
my
society
in
london
was
not
entirely
confined
to
the
pursuers
of
literature
and
art
i
had
a
few
other
friends
especially
one
old
william
shaw
afterwards
an
able
london
solicitor
his
mind
was
an
odd
compound
of
manly
sense
in
everything
connected
with
his
profession
and
boyishness
in
other
ways
he
always
retained
that
boyishness
which
was
probably
an
excellent
thing
for
him
as
a
relaxation
from
serious
cares
he
took
little
interest
in
the
fine
arts
but
at
a
later
period
he
had
the
wonderful
goodness
to
give
to
some
of
my
unpopular
and
unsalable
pictures
and
went
so
far
in
the
way
of
friendship
that
he
actually
hung
them
in
his
he
was
very
fond
of
recalling
reminiscences
of
our
childhood
especially
what
he
characterized
as
the
great
fulledge
railway
swindle
when
we
were
little
boys
we
undertook
the
construction
of
a
miniature
railway
on
his
father
land
and
issued
shares
to
pay
for
the
rolling
plant
and
the
rails
we
got
together
rather
a
handsome
sum
in
this
way
from
various
friends
and
after
the
expiration
of
some
weeks
could
show
them
a
rather
long
embankment
then
we
got
tired
of
spade
work
and
the
enterprise
languished
finally
the
works
came
to
a
standstill
and
i
believe
we
spent
the
shareholders
money
on
something
else
for
assuredly
they
never
saw
it
again
after
beginning
so
hopefully
in
the
art
of
getting
up
bubble
companies
it
is
perhaps
to
be
regretted
that
we
did
not
continue
as
we
might
have
been
eminent
financiers
by
this
time
my
friend
was
very
active
in
his
youth
i
have
seen
him
run
by
the
side
of
a
galloping
horse
in
a
field
holding
by
the
mane
and
vault
on
the
animal
back
after
which
it
went
on
faster
than
ever
and
leapt
a
little
brook
or
a
hedge
an
odd
incident
occurs
to
my
recollection
just
now
my
friend
had
a
susceptible
heart
and
a
ravishing
beauty
was
staying
at
a
certain
country
house
so
we
drove
over
to
call
there
that
he
might
see
her
i
went
with
him
and
we
had
a
with
a
very
lively
horse
the
drive
was
in
the
form
of
a
great
circle
before
the
front
door
so
he
tried
to
turn
to
the
left
but
the
horse
had
decided
for
the
right
and
between
them
they
effected
a
compromise
by
taking
a
straight
cut
over
the
lawn
and
which
presented
a
deplorable
appearance
afterwards
any
one
else
would
have
felt
a
little
confused
after
such
an
accident
but
shaw
relied
upon
the
of
the
ladies
who
always
forgave
him
everything
in
consideration
for
his
winning
ways
and
his
handsome
face
william
shaw
brother
richard
was
the
first
member
of
parliament
who
represented
burnley
i
met
him
in
london
in
and
remember
a
description
he
gave
of
an
old
gentleman
who
was
then
living
permanently
at
the
tavistock
hotel
that
old
gentleman
was
a
perfect
mystery
no
one
knew
where
he
came
from
he
never
either
wrote
or
received
a
letter
he
had
no
settled
occupation
but
read
all
the
papers
and
used
to
swear
aloud
quite
dreadfully
when
he
found
any
fact
or
opinion
that
displeased
him
he
compensated
for
this
bad
language
by
shouting
bravo
bravo
go
it
my
boy
when
he
found
an
article
to
his
mind
he
once
rambled
twice
round
covent
garden
market
without
being
able
to
find
his
way
out
and
on
discovering
that
he
had
got
back
to
the
tavistock
attributed
all
his
difficulties
to
the
waiter
and
scolded
him
most
furiously
the
mystery
about
him
and
his
odd
manners
would
have
been
an
attraction
for
dickens
amongst
other
acquaintances
that
i
made
in
london
was
mead
the
tragedian
of
drury
lane
theatre
i
recollect
admiring
his
iago
very
much
his
countenance
which
was
agreeable
and
bland
in
private
life
could
be
made
to
express
all
the
evil
passions
with
astonishing
power
he
was
rather
a
skilful
painter
having
occasionally
been
able
to
sell
a
picture
for
twenty
pounds
when
he
had
a
little
time
to
spare
mead
would
come
and
work
on
pettitt
great
picture
of
the
golden
image
he
once
drew
my
portrait
and
i
drew
his
my
guardian
was
not
quite
pleased
that
i
should
know
an
actor
but
mead
attracted
me
by
the
superior
tone
of
his
conversation
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
met
with
an
accomplished
talker
i
had
known
plenty
of
talkers
who
were
only
fluent
but
mead
had
always
something
interesting
to
say
and
he
invariably
said
it
with
easy
finish
and
good
taste
in
a
word
he
was
a
master
of
spoken
english
and
did
not
fear
to
make
use
of
his
power
not
having
the
usual
english
false
shame
which
prevents
our
countrymen
from
saying
things
quite
perfectly
mead
had
tender
feelings
once
after
reading
in
a
newspaper
the
account
of
some
battle
of
no
great
importance
as
we
consider
such
events
from
a
distance
he
suddenly
realized
in
imagination
the
effect
of
the
news
on
the
relatives
of
the
killed
and
wounded
and
burst
into
tears
mead
was
good
enough
to
accept
on
one
or
two
occasions
the
simple
kind
of
hospitality
that
i
could
offer
him
at
my
lodgings
and
i
find
notes
in
the
diary
recording
the
happy
swiftness
of
the
hours
i
spent
with
him
i
never
made
the
slightest
attempt
to
enter
what
is
specially
called
london
society
though
i
had
some
friends
or
acquaintances
who
belonged
to
it
my
time
was
entirely
taken
up
with
work
and
visits
to
a
few
houses
i
am
astonished
on
looking
back
to
those
days
by
the
extreme
kindness
of
people
who
were
much
older
than
myself
and
for
whom
my
society
could
have
no
other
attraction
than
the
opportunity
it
offered
for
the
exercise
of
their
own
goodness
i
had
one
merit
that
of
being
an
excellent
listener
which
has
been
a
great
advantage
to
me
through
life
a
distinguished
frenchman
once
said
to
me
you
are
the
best
listener
i
ever
met
but
he
had
been
accustomed
to
his
own
countrymen
who
are
not
generally
patient
or
attentive
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
and
who
have
the
habit
of
interruption
it
is
possible
too
that
my
manners
may
have
been
good
for
my
dear
guardian
so
kind
and
mild
about
most
things
could
not
tolerate
anything
like
boorishness
and
never
hesitated
to
correct
me
another
effect
of
her
influence
upon
me
was
that
i
liked
the
society
of
ladies
and
felt
quite
at
ease
in
it
there
was
a
most
intelligent
danish
family
of
ladies
rowan
and
her
daughters
who
received
me
very
kindly
they
spoke
english
wonderfully
with
something
like
a
slight
cumberland
accent
and
i
believe
their
german
was
as
good
as
their
english
rowan
had
been
a
friend
of
thorwaldsen
the
sculptor
and
possessed
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
original
drawings
which
i
did
not
see
as
she
had
lent
them
to
prince
albert
a
singular
and
most
vexatious
incident
is
associated
in
my
memory
with
those
drawings
and
i
am
sure
rowan
could
never
think
of
them
without
remembering
it
she
had
too
kindly
lent
them
to
an
artist
who
returned
them
indeed
but
not
without
having
exercised
his
own
talents
in
improving
them
as
do
to
the
work
of
their
youthful
pupils
the
reader
may
imagine
the
depth
of
rowan
gratitude
her
daughter
frederica
whose
name
afterwards
became
generally
known
was
one
of
the
most
cultivated
and
agreeable
women
i
ever
met
her
nature
had
been
a
little
saddened
by
family
misfortunes
the
rowans
had
been
a
very
wealthy
family
in
denmark
but
her
quiet
gravity
was
of
a
noble
kind
and
if
she
took
life
seriously
she
had
sufficient
reasons
for
doing
so
my
studies
under
pettitt
went
on
very
regularly
all
this
time
and
i
made
great
progress
although
as
will
be
seen
later
it
was
not
progress
in
the
right
direction
one
little
incident
may
be
mentioned
in
proof
that
i
could
at
least
imitate
closely
the
reader
is
already
aware
that
my
master
system
of
teaching
consisted
in
bringing
a
picture
slowly
forward
in
my
presence
whilst
i
was
to
copy
what
had
been
done
one
day
when
the
picture
had
got
well
forward
pettitt
took
up
my
copy
by
mistake
and
put
it
on
his
own
easel
after
he
had
worked
upon
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
thanked
him
for
the
improvement
he
said
he
had
been
quite
unconscious
of
the
difference
and
told
me
to
work
on
his
own
canvas
to
repay
him
for
his
labor
on
mine
critics
will
please
understand
that
i
know
how
little
this
proves
as
well
as
they
do
it
proves
nothing
beyond
a
talent
for
imitation
and
the
possession
of
some
manual
skill
i
have
sometimes
thought
in
later
life
that
if
instead
of
going
so
much
to
nature
i
had
mimicked
some
particular
painter
i
might
have
obtained
recognition
as
an
artist
notwithstanding
so
much
that
was
agreeable
in
my
london
life
it
was
still
a
hard
trial
of
resolution
for
me
to
work
in
a
close
and
gloomy
studio
without
any
view
from
its
window
and
in
the
beginning
of
april
i
returned
to
the
country
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
lived
in
london
which
has
probably
been
a
misfortune
to
me
both
as
artist
and
writer
i
have
been
there
frequently
on
business
but
have
never
stayed
a
day
or
an
hour
longer
than
the
time
necessary
to
get
through
what
was
most
pressing
it
is
curious
but
perfectly
true
that
i
have
never
in
my
life
felt
the
slightest
desire
to
purchase
or
rent
any
house
whatever
in
london
and
there
is
not
a
house
in
all
the
wilderness
of
brick
that
i
would
accept
as
a
free
gift
if
it
were
coupled
with
the
condition
that
i
should
live
in
it

xxiii
some
of
my
relations
emigrate
to
new
zealand
difficulties
of
a
poor
my
uncle
reasons
for
his
family
our
love
for
hollins
in
the
month
of
april
an
event
occurred
which
was
of
great
importance
in
our
family
my
eldest
uncle
holden
hamerton
emigrated
to
new
zealand
with
all
his
children
and
a
son
and
daughter
of
my
uncle
hinde
accompanied
them
this
suddenly
reduced
our
circle
by
eleven
persons
without
counting
a
young
family
belonging
to
my
cousin
orme
my
uncle
who
was
at
that
time
a
solicitor
in
halifax
had
reached
a
very
critical
period
in
the
life
of
a
de
his
children
were
grown
up
and
expensive
and
he
had
tried
various
ways
of
economizing
without
any
definite
result
amongst
others
he
had
given
up
hopwood
hall
his
mansion
in
halifax
and
had
converted
the
stabling
at
hollins
into
a
residence
for
his
wife
and
the
children
who
remained
with
her
the
stables
were
large
enough
to
make
a
spacious
dwelling
i
remember
the
regret
i
felt
on
seeing
the
workmen
pull
down
the
handsome
oak
stalls
and
remove
the
beautiful
pavement
which
was
in
blocks
of
smooth
stone
carefully
bevelled
at
the
angles
my
unfortunate
uncle
lived
like
a
bachelor
in
a
small
house
in
halifax
to
be
near
his
office
and
only
came
to
hollins
for
the
sunday
it
is
of
course
very
easy
to
criticize
a
comparatively
poor
gentleman
with
a
large
family
who
is
trying
not
to
be
ruined
it
is
easy
to
say
that
he
ought
to
live
strictly
within
his
income
whatever
it
may
be
but
to
do
that
strictly
would
require
an
iron
resolution
he
must
cut
short
all
indulgences
annihilate
all
elegancies
set
his
face
against
all
the
customs
of
his
class
his
attitude
towards
his
wife
and
children
must
be
one
of
stern
refusal
steadily
and
implacably
maintained
if
he
relaxes
and
all
the
influences
around
him
tend
to
make
him
relax
the
old
habits
of
customary
expense
will
themselves
in
a
few
weeks
he
must
cut
his
family
off
from
all
society
and
with
regard
to
himself
he
must
do
what
is
far
more
difficult
cut
himself
off
from
all
domestic
affection
behave
like
a
heartless
miser
and
at
the
very
time
when
he
most
needs
a
little
solace
and
peace
in
his
own
home
constitute
himself
the
executor
of
the
pitiless
laws
that
govern
the
human
universe
my
uncle
was
not
equal
to
all
this
he
could
make
hard
sacrifices
for
himself
and
in
fact
did
reduce
his
own
comforts
to
those
of
a
poor
bachelor
but
he
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
refuse
everything
to
his
family
so
that
although
they
made
no
pretension
now
to
anything
like
an
aristocratic
position
my
uncle
still
found
himself
to
be
living
rather
beyond
his
means
and
the
expense
of
establishing
his
sons
and
daughters
in
england
being
now
imminent
and
avoidable
only
in
one
way
he
spent
days
and
i
fear
also
nights
of
anxiety
in
arriving
at
a
determination
a
journey
to
scotland
settled
the
matter
my
uncle
visited
his
eldest
son
orme
who
was
then
at
greenock
and
he
discovered
as
i
had
done
that
my
cousin
was
married
of
course
i
had
kept
his
secret
having
found
it
out
by
accident
when
a
guest
under
his
roof
the
young
man
offered
to
accompany
his
father
to
new
zealand
and
my
uncle
who
loved
his
eldest
son
thought
that
this
would
be
some
compensation
for
leaving
england
he
did
not
know
that
orme
irresistible
instinct
for
changing
his
residence
would
make
the
new
zealand
expedition
no
more
than
a
temporary
excursion
for
him
another
reason
for
emigrating
to
new
zealand
was
this
my
uncle
second
son
lewis
had
abandoned
the
profession
of
the
law
and
gone
to
australia
by
himself
where
he
was
now
a
shepherd
in
the
bush
he
would
rejoin
his
father
and
they
would
be
a
family
all
of
them
would
be
together
in
new
zealand
except
one
my
cousin
edward
who
lay
in
the
family
vault
in
burnley
church
i
had
feelings
of
the
strongest
fraternal
affection
for
edward
and
if
the
reader
cares
to
see
his
likeness
he
has
only
to
look
at
the
engraved
portraits
of
shelley
especially
the
one
in
moxon
edition
of
the
likeness
there
is
so
striking
that
for
me
it
supplies
the
place
of
any
other
edward
died
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
had
a
gentle
and
sweet
nature
but
although
he
resembled
shelley
so
closely
in
outward
appearance
he
was
without
any
poetical
tendency
his
gifts
were
arithmetical
and
mathematical
and
whenever
he
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
he
was
sure
to
take
a
piece
of
paper
and
cover
it
all
over
with
figures
his
early
death
certainly
spared
him
much
trouble
that
he
was
hardly
qualified
to
meet
he
had
that
dislike
to
physical
exercise
which
often
accompanies
delicate
health
though
there
was
no
appearance
of
weakness
till
the
beginning
of
his
fatal
illness
i
well
remember
my
uncle
last
visit
to
his
sisters
he
did
not
say
that
it
was
his
last
but
left
some
clean
linen
in
the
house
saying
he
would
want
it
when
he
came
again
in
this
way
there
was
a
little
of
hope
but
i
doubt
if
my
aunts
were
really
deceived
and
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
think
my
uncle
seemed
flushed
and
excited
and
contradicted
me
rather
sharply
because
i
happened
to
be
in
error
about
something
of
no
importance
it
was
a
hard
moment
for
him
as
he
loved
his
sisters
and
had
the
deepest
attachment
to
hollins
where
he
was
born
and
where
he
had
passed
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
his
last
visit
has
remained
so
distinct
in
my
memory
that
i
can
even
now
see
clearly
his
great
stalwart
figure
in
the
chair
on
the
side
of
the
fireplace
then
he
left
us
and
passed
the
window
and
since
that
day
he
never
was
seen
again
at
his
old
place
i
can
imagine
what
it
must
have
been
to
him
to
turn
round
at
the
avenue
gate
and
look
back
on
the
gables
of
hollins
knowing
it
to
be
for
the
last
time
his
wife
and
the
rest
of
his
family
went
away
without
inflicting
upon
themselves
and
us
the
pain
of
a
farewell
i
was
present
however
at
featherstone
when
my
cousin
hinde
left
for
new
zealand
one
of
his
sisters
accompanied
him
out
of
pure
sisterly
devotion
she
thought
he
would
be
lonely
out
in
the
colony
so
she
would
go
and
stay
with
him
till
he
married
he
did
not
marry
and
she
never
returned
the
colonial
strength
of
england
is
founded
upon
these
family
separations
but
they
are
terrible
when
they
occur
especially
when
the
parents
are
left
behind
in
the
old
country
to
us
who
remained
this
wholesale
emigration
in
our
family
produced
the
effect
of
a
great
and
sudden
mortality
for
my
part
i
have
received
exactly
one
letter
from
the
new
zealand
hamertons
since
they
left
it
was
a
very
interesting
letter
interesting
enough
to
make
me
regret
there
was
but
one
my
uncle
property
sold
well
and
on
leaving
england
he
had
still
a
balance
of
ten
thousand
pounds
in
his
pocket
which
was
more
than
most
emigrants
set
out
with
but
he
built
a
good
house
on
the
estate
he
purchased
and
it
was
ruined
in
the
war
his
wife
was
a
woman
of
great
courage
and
wonderful
constitutional
cheerfulness
both
severely
tested
by
three
months
of
incessant
on
the
outward
voyage
they
met
with
one
terrible
storm
during
which
the
captain
did
not
hope
to
save
the
vessel
and
my
uncle
and
aunt
sat
together
in
their
cabin
clasping
each
other
hands
and
calmly
awaiting
death
after
their
departure
my
guardian
and
her
sister
remained
at
hollins
as
tenants
of
the
new
proprietor
we
still
clung
to
the
old
place
but
it
did
not
seem
the
same
to
us
on
the
night
of
the
sale
by
auction
my
aunt
said
to
me
sadly
as
we
took
our
candlesticks
to
go
to
bed
it
is
strange
to
think
that
we
positively
do
not
know
under
whose
roof
we
are
going
to
sleep
the
change
was
felt
most
painfully
by
her
my
guardian
had
a
more
resigned
way
of
accepting
the
evils
of
life
she
had
a
kind
of
christian
pessimism
that
looked
upon
terrestrial
existence
as
not
worth
living
in
itself
and
a
little
less
or
more
of
trouble
and
sorrow
in
this
world
seemed
to
her
scarcely
worth
considering
being
only
a
part
of
the
general
unsatisfactoriness
of
things
her
sister
had
intense
local
attachments
and
the
most
intense
of
them
all
was
for
this
place
her
birthplace
where
she
had
passed
her
youth
this
attachment
was
increased
in
her
case
by
a
strong
deep
and
poetic
sentiment
that
i
hardly
like
to
call
aristocratic
because
that
word
will
have
other
associations
of
pride
in
expensive
living
for
most
readers
my
aunt
had
the
true
sentiment
of
ancestry
and
it
was
painful
to
her
to
see
a
place
go
out
of
a
family
i
have
the
same
sentiment
though
with
less
intensity
and
there
were
other
reasons
that
made
me
love
hollins
very
much
at
that
time
the
natural
beauty
that
surrounded
it
was
quite
unspoilt
we
were
near
to
the
streams
and
the
moors
that
i
delighted
in
and
the
idea
of
being
obliged
to
leave
as
we
might
be
at
any
time
by
the
new
proprietor
was
painful
to
a
degree
that
only
lovers
of
nature
will
understand
even
now
in
my
year
i
very
often
dream
about
hollins
about
the
old
garden
there
and
the
fields
and
woods
and
the
rocky
stream
sometimes
the
place
is
sadly
and
stupidly
altered
in
my
dream
and
i
am
irritated
at
other
times
it
is
improved
and
enriched
and
the
very
landscape
is
idealized
into
a
nobler
and
more
perfect
beauty
i
need
only
add
to
this
account
of
my
uncle
emigration
that
when
he
landed
on
the
shores
of
new
zealand
in
much
perplexity
as
to
where
he
should
go
to
find
a
temporary
lodging
a
colonist
met
him
and
said
that
he
had
been
told
by
the
masonic
authorities
to
receive
him
fraternally
this
he
did
by
taking
the
whole
family
under
his
roof
and
entertaining
them
as
if
they
had
been
old
friends
thereby
giving
my
uncle
ample
time
to
make
his
own
arrangements
in
a
later
chapter
of
this
autobiography
i
intend
to
give
a
short
account
of
what
happened
to
the
emigrants
afterwards
chapter
xxiv
resignation
of
commission
in
the
work
from
spenser
the
loch
awe
a
i
determine
to
learn
french
a
tour
in
coolness
on
account
of
my
religious
my
evil
effects
of
religious
refuge
in
my
our
excursion
in
craven
after
returning
to
the
country
i
went
through
another
militia
training
and
soon
afterwards
resigned
my
commission
according
to
my
present
views
of
things
i
should
probably
not
have
done
so
as
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
now
to
feel
myself
of
some
definite
use
to
my
country
even
in
the
humble
capacity
of
a
militia
officer
but
in
those
days
the
militia
was
not
taken
seriously
by
the
nation
so
the
officers
did
not
take
it
seriously
either
and
after
a
brief
trial
a
great
many
of
them
resigned
the
recognized
motive
for
going
into
the
militia
was
a
social
motive
and
as
i
never
had
any
social
ambition
it
mattered
nothing
to
me
that
there
were
a
few
men
of
rank
in
the
regiment
i
had
not
any
real
companions
in
it
for
i
was
much
younger
than
most
of
my
brother
officers
and
it
is
likely
enough
that
the
society
of
an
inexperienced
youth
could
offer
no
attraction
to
them
my
love
of
my
chosen
studies
was
accompanied
by
a
complete
indifference
to
amusements
so
that
the
cards
and
billiards
after
mess
were
not
an
attraction
for
me
and
my
ignorance
of
field
sports
has
always
made
me
feel
rather
a
muff
and
a
duffer
in
the
society
of
country
gentlemen
the
colonel
was
always
kind
to
me
and
as
i
looked
older
than
my
age
he
quite
forgot
how
young
i
was
and
procured
for
me
a
captain
commission
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
a
minor
can
not
hold
a
militia
captaincy
because
it
requires
a
property
qualification
somehow
the
colonel
was
afterwards
reminded
of
my
age
and
then
thought
he
had
made
a
mistake
however
my
resignation
rectified
it
in
fairness
to
myself
it
may
be
added
that
my
military
work
was
always
done
in
a
manner
that
gained
the
approval
of
our
real
master
the
adjutant
one
cause
that
certainly
influenced
me
in
leaving
the
regiment
was
the
necessity
for
appearing
to
be
either
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
or
a
member
of
the
church
of
rome
as
i
belonged
to
neither
i
felt
it
a
hardship
to
be
compelled
to
march
to
church
every
sunday
and
go
through
the
forms
of
the
service
it
will
of
course
seem
absurd
to
any
man
of
the
world
that
such
a
trifle
should
have
any
weight
whatever
nobody
endowed
with
what
men
of
the
world
call
ever
hesitates
about
going
through
forms
and
ceremonies
when
he
can
maintain
or
increase
his
worldly
position
by
doing
so
as
for
me
i
make
no
claim
to
superior
virtue
but
can
not
help
feeling
an
invincible
repugnance
to
these
shams
my
own
line
had
been
chosen
when
i
refused
to
go
to
oxford
and
sign
the
articles
the
forced
conformity
in
the
militia
was
a
deflection
of
the
compass
but
it
has
pointed
straight
ever
since
and
may
it
point
straight
to
the
end
when
free
again
i
set
to
work
from
nature
applying
what
pettitt
had
taught
me
i
drew
and
painted
studies
of
rocks
with
great
fidelity
and
as
rocks
are
hard
things
and
my
work
was
as
hard
as
possible
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
so
far
it
was
like
nature
pettitt
had
strengthened
the
positive
and
scientific
tendency
that
there
is
in
me
so
that
i
was
quite
ardent
in
the
pursuit
of
the
rigid
and
measurable
truths
neither
knowing
nor
caring
anything
about
those
more
subtle
and
less
manifest
truths
that
the
cultivated
artist
loves
however
i
painted
away
diligently
enough
from
nature
giving
two
long
sittings
each
day
and
writing
only
in
the
evenings
my
readings
at
this
time
were
chiefly
in
shakespeare
and
spenser
i
may
have
been
attracted
to
spenser
partly
by
the
belief
greatly
encouraged
by
the
local
antiquaries
that
the
famous
elizabethan
poet
lived
for
some
time
with
relations
of
his
at
hurstwood
a
hamlet
by
the
side
of
the
same
stream
that
passes
by
hollins
and
a
mile
or
two
above
it
the
old
houses
at
hurstwood
remained
as
they
were
in
spenser
time
and
the
particular
one
is
known
where
his
reputed
family
lived
footnote
the
presumptive
evidence
in
favor
of
the
theory
that
spenser
stayed
at
hurstwood
is
very
strong
and
of
various
kinds
the
reader
who
takes
any
interest
in
the
subject
is
referred
to
the
transactions
of
the
burnley
literary
and
scientific
club
vol
where
he
will
find
a
of
the
house
that
once
belonged
to
the
spensers
of
hurstwood
as
you
ascend
the
stream
beyond
hurstwood
you
approach
the
open
moors
which
were
always
a
delight
to
me
the
love
of
the
stream
and
the
hills
beyond
frequently
led
me
to
pass
the
little
hamlet
where
spenser
is
said
to
have
lived
and
in
this
way
he
seemed
to
belong
to
our
own
landscape
since
he
must
have
wandered
by
the
same
river
and
looked
upon
the
same
hills
so
as
a
boy
whose
daily
wanderings
were
by
the
avon
might
naturally
think
of
shakespeare
more
frequently
than
another
my
thoughts
turned
often
to
the
author
of
the
faerie
queene
i
never
read
that
poem
steadily
and
fairly
through
but
i
strayed
about
in
it
which
is
the
right
way
of
reading
it
my
own
pursuit
of
poetry
at
that
time
led
me
to
think
of
a
poem
founded
on
the
legends
of
loch
awe
to
penetrate
my
mind
more
completely
with
the
genius
of
the
place
i
went
there
in
the
summer
of
and
worked
at
the
poem
besides
drawing
some
illustrations
of
which
a
few
were
afterwards
engraved
notwithstanding
a
great
liking
for
loch
awe
my
stay
there
was
not
particularly
agreeable
i
lived
of
course
at
the
inns
which
were
not
very
good
and
having
no
companion
not
even
a
servant
i
felt
rather
dull
and
lonely
especially
on
the
wet
days
a
london
banker
was
staying
at
the
inn
of
cladich
at
the
same
time
with
me
so
we
became
acquainted
and
he
wished
to
purchase
one
of
my
studies
but
as
i
intended
to
keep
them
all
i
declined
this
was
very
foolish
as
it
would
have
been
easy
to
do
another
of
the
same
subject
for
myself
and
the
mere
fact
of
selling
would
have
been
a
practical
encouragement
especially
as
that
purchase
would
probably
have
been
followed
by
others
the
very
smallest
beginnings
are
of
importance
it
is
much
for
a
young
artist
to
get
a
few
pounds
fairly
offered
by
a
customer
who
knows
nothing
about
him
except
his
work
and
is
actuated
by
no
motives
of
friendship
another
visitor
at
the
same
inn
exercised
upon
me
an
influence
of
a
very
different
kind
he
had
a
young
daughter
with
him
and
to
keep
the
girl
in
practice
he
constantly
spoke
french
to
her
i
had
studied
the
language
more
than
most
english
boys
do
and
yet
i
found
myself
totally
unable
to
follow
those
french
conversations
this
plagued
me
with
an
irritating
sense
of
ignorance
so
i
looked
back
on
my
education
generally
and
found
it
unsatisfactory
being
conscious
that
my
classical
attainments
were
not
very
valuable
i
determined
to
acquire
some
substantial
knowledge
of
modern
languages
and
to
begin
by
learning
french
over
again
so
as
to
write
and
speak
it
easily
this
resolution
remained
in
my
mind
as
irrevocably
settled
and
was
afterwards
completely
carried
out
as
i
shall
have
a
good
deal
to
say
about
loch
awe
in
future
pages
of
this
book
i
omit
all
description
of
it
here
many
of
the
days
spent
there
in
were
rainy
and
i
sat
alone
writing
my
poem
in
a
little
bedroom
on
the
of
the
inn
at
cladich
of
all
literary
work
versification
is
the
most
absorbing
and
if
it
is
good
for
nothing
else
it
has
at
least
the
merit
of
getting
one
well
through
a
rainy
day
on
my
return
from
scotland
i
accompanied
my
guardian
and
her
sister
on
a
tour
in
wales
we
revisited
rhyl
and
some
other
places
that
i
had
seen
with
my
father
including
caernarvon
this
tour
was
of
no
importance
in
itself
but
as
from
scotland
i
had
brought
the
resolution
that
made
me
seriously
study
french
so
from
caernarvon
i
brought
a
resolution
to
master
the
art
of
swimming
being
in
the
water
one
morning
i
suddenly
found
that
i
could
swim
after
a
fashion
and
this
led
to
more
serious
efforts
our
stream
at
home
was
delightful
for
mere
bathing
but
the
rocks
were
an
impediment
to
active
exercise
i
afterwards
became
an
accomplished
swimmer
and
could
do
various
tricks
in
the
water
such
as
reading
aloud
from
a
book
held
in
both
hands
or
swimming
in
clothes
and
heavy
boots
with
one
hand
out
of
the
water
carrying
a
paddle
and
drawing
a
canoe
after
me
i
have
often
carried
one
of
my
little
boys
on
my
shoulders
but
they
are
now
better
swimmers
than
myself
and
the
eldest
has
saved
several
men
from
drowning
it
is
an
immense
comfort
if
nothing
else
to
be
perfectly
at
home
in
the
water
and
it
has
increased
my
pleasure
in
boating
a
there
is
nothing
further
of
importance
to
be
noted
for
the
year
except
that
i
began
to
perceive
a
certain
coolness
or
what
the
french
call
in
our
friends
which
i
attributed
to
my
religious
opinions
i
never
obtruded
my
opinions
on
any
one
but
did
not
conceal
them
beneath
the
usual
conventional
observances
so
that
our
neighbors
became
aware
that
i
did
not
think
in
a
strictly
orthodox
manner
though
they
were
in
fact
completely
ignorant
of
the
true
nature
of
my
beliefs
i
remember
one
interesting
test
of
my
changed
position
in
society
there
was
a
certain
great
country
house
where
i
had
been
on
the
most
intimate
terms
from
childhood
where
the
boys
called
me
by
my
christian
name
as
i
called
them
by
theirs
and
where
my
guardian
and
i
were
from
time
to
time
invited
to
dine
and
sometimes
to
spend
a
day
or
two
when
our
militia
regiment
was
in
training
the
owner
of
this
house
invited
the
officers
to
a
grand
dinner
and
i
an
old
intimate
friend
was
omitted
it
was
impossible
that
this
omission
could
have
been
accidental
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
it
i
afterwards
learned
that
my
religious
views
were
regarded
with
disapproval
in
that
house
and
there
of
course
the
matter
rested
at
the
same
time
or
soon
afterwards
i
noticed
that
invitations
from
certain
other
houses
also
came
to
an
end
a
matter
of
little
consequence
to
me
personally
but
i
thought
that
it
might
indirectly
be
injurious
to
my
guardian
and
her
sister
and
began
to
feel
that
i
had
become
a
sort
of
social
disgrace
and
impediment
for
them
it
was
probably
about
this
time
that
my
guardian
bought
for
me
some
religious
books
in
which
heterodox
opinions
were
represented
as
being
invariably
the
result
of
wickedness
i
said
it
was
a
pity
that
religious
writers
could
not
learn
to
be
more
just
as
heterodoxy
might
be
due
to
simple
intellectual
differences
my
guardian
answered
that
she
could
perceive
no
injustice
whatever
in
the
statement
that
i
complained
of
this
was
infinitely
painful
to
me
as
coming
from
the
person
i
most
loved
and
esteemed
in
all
the
world
another
incident
embittered
my
existence
for
some
time
i
had
an
intimate
friend
in
burnley
and
my
guardian
said
that
she
regretted
this
intimacy
not
for
any
harm
that
my
friend
was
likely
to
do
me
but
because
with
my
lamentable
opinions
i
might
corrupt
his
mind
my
answer
to
attacks
of
this
kind
has
always
been
simple
silence
when
they
came
from
other
people
i
treated
them
with
unfeigned
indifference
but
when
they
came
from
that
one
dear
person
whose
affection
i
valued
more
than
all
honors
and
all
fame
they
cut
me
to
the
quick
and
then
i
knew
by
cruel
experience
what
a
dreadful
evil
religious
bigotry
is
for
what
had
i
ever
said
or
done
to
deserve
censure
i
had
as
good
a
right
to
my
opinions
as
other
people
had
to
theirs
yet
i
kept
them
within
my
own
breast
and
avoided
even
the
shadow
of
offence
my
only
crime
was
the
negative
one
of
nonconformity
even
in
my
latter
years
the
same
old
spirit
of
intolerance
pursues
me
the
nearest
relation
i
have
left
in
england
said
to
my
wife
that
she
hoped
my
books
had
not
an
extensive
sale
so
that
their
evil
influence
might
be
as
narrowly
restricted
as
possible
as
for
her
she
would
not
even
look
into
them
footnote
in
writing
this
autobiography
i
often
suddenly
remember
some
forgotten
incident
of
past
times
here
is
one
that
has
just
occurred
to
me
when
walking
out
in
i
met
a
boy
who
shouted
after
me
you
the
fellow
that
thinks
we
are
all
like
rats
he
had
probably
heard
my
opinions
discussed
in
his
family
circle
how
justly
and
how
intelligently
his
exclamation
shows
my
refuge
in
those
days
was
that
best
of
all
refuges
occupation
i
was
constantly
at
work
on
my
different
pursuits
and
led
a
very
healthy
life
at
hollins
the
greatest
objection
to
it
was
an
evil
that
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
in
several
different
places
and
that
is
intellectual
isolation
especially
on
the
side
of
art
i
had
nobody
to
speak
to
on
that
subject
except
my
old
henry
palmer
he
had
inevitably
fallen
into
the
usual
routine
of
futile
teaching
which
is
the
fault
of
an
uneducated
public
opinion
and
of
which
the
themselves
are
the
first
victims
so
i
did
not
take
lessons
from
him
but
he
felt
a
warm
and
earnest
interest
in
the
fine
arts
and
we
talked
about
old
masters
and
modern
masters
for
hours
together
in
my
study
at
hollins
and
in
our
walks
we
once
made
a
delightful
sketching
excursion
together
into
the
district
of
craven
and
i
remember
that
at
bolton
abbey
we
met
with
a
wonderful
german
who
could
sit
in
the
presence
of
nature
and
coolly
make
trees
according
to
a
mechanical
recipe
he
might
just
as
well
have

advice
to
poetic
mistake
in
illustrating
my
book
of
its
subsequent
want
of

the
too
much
abandonment
of

my
volume
the
isles
of
loch
awe
and
other
poems
appeared
the
day
i
came
of
age
september
it
was
published
at
my
own
expense
in
an
edition
of
two
thousand
copies
of
which
exactly
eleven
were
sold
in
the
real
literary
market
the
town
of
burnley
took
copies
from
a
friendly
interest
in
the
author
and
deserves
my
deepest
gratitude
not
that
the
copies
quite
paid
the
expenses
of
publication
perhaps
some
poetic
aspirant
may
read
these
pages
and
if
he
does
he
may
accept
a
word
of
advice
the
difficulty
in
publishing
poems
is
to
get
them
fully
and
fairly
read
and
considered
by
some
publisher
of
real
eminence
in
the
trade
it
is
difficult
to
appreciate
poetry
in
manuscript
and
there
is
such
a
natural
tendency
to
refuse
anything
in
the
form
of
metre
that
it
is
well
to
smooth
the
way
for
it
as
much
as
possible
i
would
therefore
if
i
had
to
begin
again
get
my
poems
put
into
type
and
a
private
edition
of
one
hundred
copies
should
be
printed
a
few
of
these
being
sent
to
the
leading
publishers
i
should
very
soon
ascertain
whether
any
one
of
them
was
inclined
to
bring
out
the
work
if
they
all
declined
my
loss
would
be
the
smallest
possible
and
i
should
possess
a
few
copies
of
a
rare
book
if
one
publisher
accepted
i
should
get
an
appeal
to
the
public
which
is
all
that
a
young
author
wants
footnote
a
single
copy
clearly
printed
by
the
machine
would
now
be
almost
as
good
for
the
purpose
as
a
small
privately
printed
edition
i
committed
a
great
error
in
illustrating
my
book
of
verse
the
illustrations
only
set
up
a
conflict
of
interest
with
the
poetry
and
did
no
good
whatever
to
the
sale
whilst
they
vastly
increased
the
cost
of
publication
poetry
is
an
independent
art
and
if
it
can
not
stand
on
its
own
merits
the
reason
must
be
that
it
is
destitute
of
vitality
the
subsequent
history
of
this
volume
of
poems
is
worth
telling
to
those
who
take
an
interest
in
books
it
was
published
at
six
shillings
and
as
the
sale
had
been
extremely
small
i
reduced
the
price
to
the
reduction
brought
on
a
sale
of
about
three
hundred
copies
and
there
it
stopped
i
then
disposed
of
the
entire
remainder
to
a
wholesale
buyer
of
remainders
for
the
modest
sum
of
sixpence
per
copy
since
i
have
become
known
as
a
writer
of
prose
many
people
have
sought
out
this
book
of
verse
with
the
wonderful
and
unforeseen
result
that
it
has
resumed
its
original
price
i
myself
have
purchased
copies
for
five
shillings
each
that
i
had
sold
for
sixpence
not
a
profitable
species
of
commerce
and
i
have
been
told
that
the
book
is
now
worth
six
shillings
exactly
my
original
estimate
of
its
possible
value
to
an
enlightened
and
discriminating
public
emerson
wrote
that
the
english
had
many
poetical
writers
but
no
poet
and
this
at
a
time
when
tennyson
was
already
famous
the
same
spirit
of
exclusion
in
a
minor
degree
will
deny
the
existence
of
all
poets
except
three
or
perhaps
four
in
a
generation
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
hope
to
be
one
of
the
three
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
presumptuous
in
me
to
hope
for
some
readers
for
my
verse
as
this
autobiography
approached
that
early
publication
i
read
the
volume
over
again
with
a
fresh
eye
after
an
interval
of
many
years
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
written
by
somebody
else
there
is
poetry
in
the
verse
and
there
is
prose
also
my
fault
having
been
at
that
time
that
i
was
unable
to
discriminate
between
the
two
i
had
not
the
craft
and
art
to
make
the
most
of
such
poetical
ideas
as
were
really
my
own
these
defects
are
natural
enough
in
a
very
young
writer
who
could
not
possibly
have
much
literary
skill
amongst
other
marks
of
its
absence
or
deficiency
must
be
reckoned
the
facility
with
which
i
allowed
the
mere
to
get
into
my
verse
not
being
clearly
aware
that
the
is
death
to
poetic
art
and
that
nothing
whatever
is
admissible
into
poetry
without
being
first
idealized
another
cause
of
inferiority
was
that
my
emotions
were
too
real
the
consequence
of
reality
in
emotion
is
very
curious
being
exactly
the
contrary
of
what
one
would
naturally
expect
real
emotion
expresses
itself
simply
and
briefly
and
often
quite
feebly
and
inadequately
footnote
amongst
the
uneducated
genuine
emotion
is
often
voluble
but
poets
usually
belong
to
the
educated
classes
the
result
of
course
is
that
the
reader
feelings
are
not
played
upon
sufficiently
to
excite
them
feigned
or
artistic
emotion
on
the
contrary
leaves
the
poetic
artist
in
the
fullest
possession
of
all
his
means
of
influence
and
he
works
upon
the
reader
feelings
by
slow
or
by
sudden
effects
at
his
own
choice
footnote
two
diametrically
opposite
opinions
on
this
subject
are
held
by
actors
some
of
whom
think
that
in
their
profession
emotion
ought
to
be
real
others
that
it
ought
to
be
feigned
i
know
nothing
about
acting
but
have
always
found
in
literature
and
art
and
even
in
the
intercourse
of
life
that
my
own
real
emotions
expressed
themselves
very
inadequately
the
failure
of
the
isles
of
loch
awe
occasioned
me
rather
a
heavy
loss
which
had
the
effect
of
making
me
economical
for
two
or
three
years
during
which
i
did
not
even
keep
a
horse
i
also
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nobody
wanted
my
verses
and
not
having
either
the
inspiration
of
shelley
and
keats
or
the
dogged
determination
of
wordsworth
i
gave
up
writing
verse
altogether
and
that
with
a
suddenness
and
completeness
that
astonishes
me
now
young
men
are
extreme
in
their
hopes
and
in
their
discouragements
i
had
expected
to
sell
two
thousand
copies
of
a
book
of
poetry
by
a
totally
unknown
writer
and
because
i
did
not
immediately
succeed
in
the
hopeless
attempt
i
must
needs
break
with
literature
altogether
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
pursue
the
art
of
prose
composition
which
is
quite
as
interesting
as
that
of
verse
and
ten
times
more
rewarding
in
every
sense
my
book
had
been
on
the
whole
very
kindly
received
by
the
reviews
and
a
very
odd
incident
occurred
in
connection
with
a
periodical
at
that
time
fraser
magazine
was
one
of
the
great
authorities
and
a
contributor
to
it
was
so
pleased
with
my
poems
that
he
determined
to
write
an
important
article
upon
them
one
of
his
friends
knew
of
this
intention
and
told
me
he
revealed
to
the
contributor
accidentally
that
he
had
given
me
this
piece
of
information
on
which
the
contributor
at
once
replied
that
since
the
author
of
the
volume
had
been
made
aware
that
it
was
to
be
reviewed
it
was
evident
that
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
had
made
it
impossible
to
write
the
article
does
the
reader
perceive
the
impossibility
i
confess
that
it
is
invisible
for
me
however
by
this
trifling
incident
my
book
missed
a
most
important
review
which
at
that
time
might
have
classed
it
amongst
the
noticeable
publications
of
the
period
my
commercial
in
poetry
threw
me
back
more
decidedly
upon
painting
and
this
in
combination
with
the
resolution
to
learn
french
well
of
which
something
has
been
already
said
made
me
go
to
paris
in
the
autumn
of
i
was
at
that
time
so
utterly
ignorant
of
modern
languages
as
they
are
spoken
that
in
the
train
between
calais
and
paris
i
could
not
be
certain
until
i
was
told
by
an
englishman
who
was
more
of
a
linguist
than
myself
which
of
my
were
speaking
french
and
which
italian
i
made
such
good
use
of
my
time
in
paris
that
when
returning
to
england
on
the
same
railway
after
the
short
interval
of
three
months
i
spoke
french
fluently
though
not
correctly
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
and
did
not
miss
a
syllable
that
was
said
to
me
i
had
no
knowledge
of
paris
and
its
hotels
so
let
myself
be
guided
by
a
we
went
to
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
then
so
new
that
it
smelt
of
plaster
and
paint
in
those
days
big
splendid
hotels
were
almost
unknown
in
europe
the
vast
with
its
palatial
decoration
impressed
my
inexperience
very
strongly
during
my
stay
in
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
english
officers
one
was
a
man
of
about
physically
the
finest
englishman
i
was
ever
personally
acquainted
with
and
another
was
a
much
older
and
more
experienced
officer
on
leave
of
absence
from
india
where
he
ruled
over
a
considerable
territory
his
name
was
turnbull
and
i
have
been
told
since
by
another
indian
officer
that
captain
turnbull
was
the
original
of
colonel
newcome
certainly
he
was
one
of
the
kindest
most
amiable
and
most
unpretending
gentlemen
i
ever
met
these
two
officers
were
invited
to
the
ball
at
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
that
was
given
by
the
parisian
municipality
to
the
emperor
and
king
victor
emmanuel
and
it
happened
that
the
young
military
adonis
had
not
his
uniform
with
him
whilst
the
idea
of
going
to
the
ball
without
it
and
appearing
only
like
a
commonplace
civilian
was
so
vexatious
as
to
be
inadmissible
he
therefore
refused
to
go
and
transferred
his
card
to
me
so
i
went
with
captain
turnbull
who
had
a
cocked
hat
like
a
general
and
was
taken
for
one
some
french
people
by
a
stretch
of
imagination
even
took
him
for
prince
albert
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
was
very
splendid
on
a
night
of
that
kind
and
when
long
afterwards
i
saw
it
as
a
blackened
ruin
the
details
of
that
past
splendor
all
came
back
to
me
the
most
interesting
moment
was
when
the
crowd
of
guests
formed
in
two
lines
in
the
great
and
the
emperor
and
king
took
their
places
for
a
short
time
on
two
thrones
after
which
they
slowly
walked
down
the
open
space
i
happened
to
be
standing
near
a
french
general
who
kindly
spoke
a
few
words
to
me
and
just
after
that
the
emperor
came
and
shook
hands
with
him
asking
a
friendly
question
in
this
way
i
saw
louis
napoleon
very
plainly
but
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
souvenirs
for
me
is
certainly
that
of
the
immortal
leader
of
men
who
was
afterwards
the
first
king
of
italy
as
for
louis
napoleon
the
sight
of
him
in
his
glory
called
to
mind
an
anecdote
told
of
him
by
major
towneley
in
our
regiment
when
an
exile
in
london
he
spoke
to
the
major
of
some
project
that
he
would
put
into
execution
je
serai
do
you
really
still
cherish
hopes
of
that
kind
asked
the
sceptical
englishman
they
are
not
merely
hopes
answered
louis
napoleon
but
a
certainty
he
believed
firmly
in
the
of
the
empire
but
had
no
faith
whatever
in
its
permanence
this
uneasy
apprehension
of
a
fall
was
publicly
betrayed
afterwards
by
the
unnecessary
plebiscitum
in
a
conversation
with
a
french
supporter
of
the
empire
louis
napoleon
said
so
long
as
i
am
necessary
my
power
will
remain
unshakable
but
when
my
hour
comes
i
shall
be
broken
like
glass
he
believed
himself
to
be
simply
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
that
would
be
thrown
away
when
no
longer
of
any
use
we
who
saw
the
sovereigns
of
france
and
sardinia
walking
down
that
together
little
imagined
what
would
be
the
ultimate
consequences
of
their
alliance
the
establishment
of
the
italian
kingdom
then
of
the
german
empire
with
the
siege
of
paris
the
commune
and
the
total
destruction
of
the
building
that
dazzled
us
by
its
splendor
and
of
the
palace
where
the
sovereigns
slept
that
night
now
they
sleep
far
apart
one
in
the
pantheon
of
ancient
rome
in
the
midst
of
the
italian
people
who
hold
his
name
in
everlasting
honor
the
other
in
an
exile
grave
in
england
with
a
name
upon
it
that
is
execrated

boulogne
to

his
his
eldest
daughter
captain
turnbull
knew
some
english
people
in
the
colony
at
paris
so
he
introduced
me
to
two
or
three
houses
and
if
my
object
had
been
to
speak
english
instead
of
french
i
might
have
gone
into
the
society
of
that
day
one
house
was
interesting
to
me
that
of
thackeray
mother
carmichael
smith
her
second
husband
the
major
was
still
living
and
she
was
a
vigorous
and
majestic
elderly
lady
she
talked
to
me
about
her
son
and
his
pursuit
of
art
but
i
do
not
remember
that
she
told
me
anything
that
the
public
has
not
since
learned
from
other
sources
i
soon
discovered
that
she
had
very
decided
views
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
that
she
looked
even
upon
unitarians
with
reprobation
especially
as
they
might
be
infidels
in
disguise
my
own
subsequent
experience
of
the
world
has
led
me
to
perceive
that
when
infidels
wear
a
cloak
they
generally
put
on
a
more
useful
and
fashionable
one
than
that
of
unitarianism
they
assume
the
religion
that
can
best
help
them
to
get
on
in
the
world
however
i
was
not
going
to
argue
such
a
point
with
a
lady
who
was
considerably
my
senior
and
i
was
constantly
in
expectation
of
being
examined
about
my
own
religious
views
knowing
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
give
satisfactory
answers
i
therefore
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
keep
out
of
carmichael
smith
way
and
learned
afterwards
that
she
had
a
reputation
for
asserting
the
faith
that
was
in
her
and
for
expressing
her
disapproval
of
everybody
who
believed
less
for
my
part
i
confess
to
a
cowardly
dread
of
elderly
religious
englishwomen
they
have
examined
me
many
a
time
and
i
have
never
come
out
of
the
ordeal
with
satisfaction
either
to
them
or
to
myself
thackeray
three
daughters
were
in
paris
at
that
time
i
remember
miss
thackeray
quite
distinctly
she
struck
me
as
a
young
lady
of
uncommon
sense
and
penetration
and
it
was
not
at
all
a
surprise
to
me
when
she
afterwards
became
distinguished
in
literature
thackeray
himself
was
in
london
so
i
did
not
meet
him
i
went
occasionally
in
the
evening
to
see
that
remarkable
woman
madame
mohl
she
was
the
little
figure
with
her
original
notions
about
toilette
to
which
she
was
by
no
means
indifferent
in
the
year
she
still
considered
herself
a
very
young
woman
and
indeed
was
so
relatively
to
the
great
age
she
was
destined
to
attain
after
i
had
been
about
six
weeks
in
paris
her
husband
gave
me
the
first
bit
of
really
valuable
encouragement
about
speaking
french
that
i
had
received
from
any
one
can
you
follow
what
is
said
by
others
yes
easily
very
well
then
you
may
be
free
from
all
anxiety
about
speaking
you
will
certainly
speak
in
due
time
an
eccentric
but
thoroughly
manly
and
honest
englishman
named
scholey
was
staying
at
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
at
the
same
time
with
captain
turnbull
he
was
an
old
bachelor
and
looked
upon
marriage
as
a
snare
but
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
been
in
love
at
an
earlier
period
of
his
existence
and
that
the
engagement
had
been
broken
off
by
the
friends
of
the
young
lady
because
scholey
combined
the
two
great
defects
of
honesty
and
thinking
for
himself
in
religious
matters
so
long
as
people
prefer
sneaks
and
hypocrites
to
straightforward
characters
like
scholey
such
men
are
likely
to
be
kept
out
of
polite
society
a
dishonest
man
will
profess
any
opinion
that
you
please
or
that
is
likely
to
please
you
so
long
as
it
will
advance
his
interest
if
therefore
a
lover
runs
the
risk
of
breaking
off
a
marriage
rather
than
turn
hypocrite
it
is
clear
that
his
sense
of
honor
has
borne
a
crucial
test
i
had
not
loved
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
more
scholey
spoke
french
fluently
and
as
he
lived
on
the
edge
of
england
he
often
crossed
over
into
france
i
deeply
regret
not
to
have
seen
much
more
of
him
one
of
his
acts
of
kindness
in
was
to
take
me
to
see
his
old
friend
william
wyld
the
painter
with
whom
i
soon
became
acquainted
and
who
is
still
one
of
my
best
and
most
attached
friends
wyld
lived
and
worked
at
that
time
in
the
same
studio
in
the
rue
blanche
where
he
is
still
living
and
working
in
this
present
year
an
octogenarian
with
the
health
and
faculties
of
a
man
of
fifty
there
was
in
those
days
an
indian
staying
at
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
who
spoke
english
very
well
but
not
french
so
he
was
working
at
french
diligently
with
a
master
this
indian
was
always
called
the
prince
in
the
hotel
though
he
was
not
a
prince
at
all
and
never
pretended
to
be
one
but
disclaimed
the
title
whenever
he
had
a
chance
he
lived
rather
expensively
but
without
the
least
ostentation
and
had
very
quiet
manners
he
progressed
well
with
his
french
studies
but
did
not
stay
long
enough
to
master
the
language
i
was
very
much
interested
in
him
as
a
young
man
is
in
all
that
is
strange
and
a
little
romantic
he
talked
about
india
with
great
apparent
frankness
saying
that
naturally
the
indians
desired
national
independence
but
were
too
much
divided
amongst
themselves
to
be
likely
to
attain
it
in
our
time
the
mutiny
broke
out
rather
more
than
a
year
afterwards
and
then
i
remembered
these
conversations
the
prince
had
some
precious
and
curious
things
with
him
which
he
showed
me
but
his
extreme
dislike
to
attracting
attention
made
him
dress
quite
plainly
at
all
times
especially
when
he
went
out
which
was
usually
in
a
small
brougham
now
and
then
an
english
official
from
india
or
some
military
officer
would
call
upon
him
and
sometimes
they
spoke
arabic
or
hindostanee
there
was
a
lady
at
the
hotel
who
has
always
remained
in
my
memory
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
human
beings
i
ever
met
she
was
an
italian
yet
neither
pretty
nor
handsome
and
above
all
she
dressed
with
studiously
quiet
taste
and
used
to
dine
at
the
with
the
rest
of
us
besides
her
native
italian
she
spoke
french
and
english
with
surprising
perfection
and
her
manners
were
so
modest
so
unexceptionable
in
every
way
that
no
one
not
in
the
secret
would
or
could
have
suspected
her
real
business
which
was
to
secure
a
succession
of
temporary
husbands
in
the
most
respectable
manner
and
without
leaving
the
hotel
her
linguistic
accomplishments
gave
her
a
wide
field
of
choice
and
representatives
of
various
nations
succeeded
each
other
at
irregular
but
never
very
long
intervals
as
i
shall
be
dead
when
this
is
published
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
that
i
was
not
one
of
the
series
the
reader
may
believe
this
when
he
remembers
that
i
was
very
economical
for
the
time
being
in
consequence
of
the
loss
on
my
book
of
poems
after
a
while
my
french
teacher
informed
me
that
the
prince
had
been
caught
by
the
fair
italian
who
established
herself
quietly
somewhere
in
his
suite
of
rooms
people
did
not
think
this
very
wrong
in
a
mahometan
but
after
his
departure
from
paris
i
happened
to
be
studying
some
old
italian
religious
pictures
in
the
louvre
and
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
same
lady
was
looking
at
a
perugino
near
me
this
time
she
was
with
the
prince
successor
a
most
respectable
english
gentleman
and
so
far
as
absolute
correctness
of
outward
appearance
went
there
was
not
a
more
presentable
couple
in
the
galleries
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
succeeded
more
by
her
good
manners
and
quiet
way
of
dressing
than
by
anything
else
she
must
have
been
a
real
lady
who
had
fallen
into
that
way
of
life
in
consequence
of
a
reverse
of
fortune
after
a
while
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
too
much
with
english
people
at
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
and
an
incident
occurred
which
altered
the
whole
course
of
my
future
life
and
is
the
reason
why
i
am
now
writing
this
book
in
france
i
had
been
up
late
one
night
at
the
opera
and
the
next
morning
rose
an
hour
later
than
usual
an
american
came
into
the
of
the
hotel
and
found
me
taking
my
chocolate
had
i
risen
only
earlier
i
should
have
got
through
that
cup
of
chocolate
and
been
already
out
in
the
streets
before
the
american
came
down
to
have
missed
him
would
have
been
never
to
know
my
wife
never
even
to
see
her
face
as
the
reader
will
perceive
in
the
sequel
and
the
consequences
of
not
marrying
her
would
have
been
incalculable
one
of
them
is
certain
in
my
own
mind
the
modest
degree
of
literary
reputation
that
makes
this
autobiography
acceptable
from
a
point
of
view
has
been
won
slowly
and
arduously
it
has
been
the
result
of
long
and
steadfast
labor
and
there
is
no
merely
personal
motive
that
would
have
ever
made
me
persevere
consequently
the
existence
of
this
volume
and
any
meaning
that
now
belongs
to
the
name
on
its
title
page
are
due
to
my
getting
up
late
that
morning
in
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
the
american
and
i
being
alone
in
the
and
shamefully
late
were
drawn
together
by
the
sympathy
created
by
an
identical
situation
and
began
to
talk
he
gave
some
reasons
for
being
in
paris
and
i
gave
mine
which
was
to
learn
french
we
then
agreed
that
to
get
accustomed
to
the
use
of
a
foreign
language
the
first
thing
was
to
surround
ourselves
with
it
entirely
and
that
this
could
not
be
done
in
a
cosmopolitan
place
like
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
i
have
a
french
friend
the
american
said
who
could
give
you
the
address
of
some
purely
french
hotel
where
you
would
not
hear
a
syllable
of
english
after
breakfast
he
kindly
took
me
to
see
this
friend
who
was
a
merchant
sitting
in
a
pretty
and
tidy
all
in
green
and
new
oak
the
merchant
spoke
english
he
had
lived
in
america
and
said
i
know
exactly
what
you
want
a
quiet
little
french
hotel
in
the
champs
√©lys√©es
where
you
can
have
clean
rooms
and
a
he
wrote
me
the
address
on
a
card
and
i
went
to
look
at
the
place
the
hotel
which
exists
no
longer
was
in
the
avenue
montaigne
it
suited
my
tastes
precisely
being
extremely
quiet
as
it
looked
upon
a
retired
garden
and
the
rooms
were
perfectly
clean
there
was
only
one
story
above
the
and
here
i
took
a
bedroom
and
looking
upon
the
garden
the
house
was
kept
by
a
widow
who
had
very
good
manners
and
was
in
her
own
person
a
pleasant
example
of
the
cleanliness
that
characterized
the
house
i
learned
afterwards
not
from
herself
that
she
had
been
a
lady
reduced
to
poor
circumstances
by
the
loss
of
her
husband
and
that
her
relations
being
determined
that
she
should
do
something
for
her
living
had
advanced
some
money
on
condition
that
she
set
up
an
establishment
having
no
experience
in
she
soon
dissipated
the
little
capital
and
lived
afterwards
on
a
pittance
in
the
strictest
retirement
when
i
took
my
rooms
the
small
hotel
seemed
modestly
prosperous
there
were
about
a
dozen
people
at
the
but
they
did
not
all
stay
in
the
house
we
had
an
officer
in
the
army
who
had
brought
his
young
provincial
wife
to
paris
a
beautiful
but
remarkably
unintelligent
person
and
there
were
other
people
who
might
be
taken
as
fair
specimens
of
the
better
french
the
most
interesting
person
in
the
hotel
was
an
old
gentleman
whose
name
i
may
give
victor
ouvrard
a
nephew
of
the
famous
ouvrard
who
had
been
a
great
contractor
for
military
clothes
and
accoutrements
under
napoleon
victor
ouvrard
was
living
on
a
pension
given
by
a
wealthy
relation
and
doing
what
he
could
to
push
a
hopeless
claim
on
napoleon
iii
for
several
millions
of
francs
due
by
the
first
emperor
to
his
uncle
i
know
nothing
about
the
great
contractor
except
the
curious
fact
that
he
remained
in
prison
for
a
long
time
rather
than
give
up
a
large
sum
of
money
to
the
government
saying
that
by
the
mere
sacrifice
of
his
liberty
he
was
earning
a
handsome
income
the
nephew
was
what
we
call
a
gentleman
a
model
of
good
manners
and
delicate
sentiments
he
would
have
made
an
excellent
character
for
a
novelist
with
his
constantly
expressed
regret
that
he
had
not
a
speciality
si
une
sp√©cialit√©
he
would
say
as
he
tapped
his
and
looked
up
wistfully
to
the
ceiling
si
seulement
une
sp√©cialit√©
he
felt
himself
humiliated
by
the
necessity
for
accepting
his
little
pension
and
still
entertained
a
chimerical
hope
that
if
the
emperor
did
not
restore
the
millions
that
were
due
he
might
at
least
bestow
upon
him
enough
for
independence
in
his
last
years
there
had
been
some
slight
indications
of
a
favorable
turn
in
the
emperor
mind
but
they
came
to
nothing
meanwhile
victor
ouvrard
lived
on
with
strict
economy
brushing
his
old
coats
till
they
were
threadbare
and
never
allowing
himself
a
vehicle
in
the
streets
of
paris
he
was
an
excellent
walker
and
we
explored
a
great
part
of
the
town
together
on
foot
he
kindly
took
patience
with
my
imperfect
french
and
often
gently
corrected
me
the
long
conversations
i
had
with
ouvrard
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
in
addition
to
my
daily
lessons
from
masters
got
me
forward
with
surprising
rapidity
i
observed
a
strict
rule
of
abstinence
from
english
never
calling
on
any
english
people
with
the
single
exception
of
wyld
the
painter
nor
reading
any
english
books
when
ouvrard
was
not
with
me
in
the
streets
of
paris
i
got
up
conversations
with
anybody
who
would
talk
to
me
merely
to
get
practice
and
in
my
own
room
i
wrote
french
every
day
besides
this
for
physical
exercise
i
became
a
pupil
in
a
gymnasium
and
worked
there
regularly
one
thing
seemed
strange
in
the
way
they
treated
us
when
we
were
as
hot
as
possible
with
exercise
at
the
moment
of
leaving
off
and
changing
our
dress
men
came
to
the
to
sponge
us
with
water
they
said
it
did
nothing
but
good
and
certainly
i
never
felt
any
bad
effects
from
the
practice
the
water
reminds
me
of
a
ridiculous
incident
that
occurred
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
ouvrard
and
i
were
walking
together
in
the
direction
of
the
palace
when
we
saw
a
frenchman
going
towards
it
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
edifice
he
was
so
entirely
absorbed
by
his
architectural
studies
that
he
did
not
notice
the
basin
just
in
front
of
him
the
stone
lip
of
the
basin
projects
a
little
on
the
land
side
so
that
if
you
catch
your
foot
in
it
no
recovery
is
possible
this
he
did
and
was
thrown
violently
full
length
upon
the
thin
ice
which
offered
little
resistance
to
his
weight
the
basin
is
not
more
than
a
yard
deep
so
he
got
out
and
made
his
way
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
his
clothes
streaming
on
the
causeway
some
spectators
laughed
and
others
smiled
but
ouvrard
remained
perfectly
grave
saying
that
he
could
not
understand
how
people
could
be
so
unfeeling
as
to
laugh
at
a
misfortune
for
the
man
would
probably
take
cold
perhaps
the
reader
thinks
he
had
no
sense
of
humor
yes
he
had
he
was
very
facetious
and
a
hearty
laugher
but
his
delicacy
of
feeling
was
so
refined
that
he
could
not
laugh
at
an
accident
that
seemed
to
call
rather
for
his
sympathy
a
french
gentleman
who
was
staying
at
the
hotel
had
a
friend
who
came
occasionally
to
see
him
and
this
friend
was
an
amiable
and
interesting
talker
he
had
at
the
same
time
much
natural
politeness
and
seeing
that
i
wanted
to
practise
conversation
he
indulged
me
by
patiently
listening
to
my
bad
french
and
giving
me
his
own
remarkably
pure
and
masterly
french
in
return
his
name
i
learned
was
gindriez
and
he
was
living
in
paris
by
the
tolerance
of
the
emperor
he
had
been
prefect
of
the
doubs
under
the
second
republic
and
had
resigned
his
prefecture
as
soon
as
the
orders
emanating
from
the
executive
government
betrayed
the
intention
of
establishing
the
empire
as
a
member
of
the
national
assembly
he
had
voted
against
the
bonapartists
and
was
one
of
the
few
representatives
who
were
concerting
measures
against
napoleon
when
he
forestalled
them
by
striking
first
after
the
gindriez
fled
to
belgium
but
returned
to
paris
for
family
reasons
and
was
permitted
to
remain
on
condition
that
he
did
not
actively
set
himself
in
opposition
to
the
empire
gindriez
looked
upon
his
own
political
career
as
ended
though
he
could
have
made
it
prosperous
enough
and
even
brilliant
by
serving
the
power
of
the
day
a
more
flexible
instrument
had
been
put
into
his
prefecture
a
new
legislative
body
had
been
elected
to
give
a
false
appearance
of
parliamentary
government
and
an
autocratic
system
had
been
established
which
gindriez
believed
destined
to
a
prolonged
duration
though
he
felt
sure
that
it
could
not
last
forever
subsequent
events
have
proved
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
the
empire
outlasted
the
lifetime
of
gindriez
but
it
did
not
establish
itself
permanently
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
mine
in
early
life
which
i
never
thought
about
at
the
time
but
which
has
become
evident
in
the
course
of
this
autobiography
to
prefer
the
society
of
elderly
men
in
london
i
had
liked
to
be
with
mackay
robinson
the
engraver
and
leslie
all
men
and
in
paris
i
soon
acquired
a
strong
liking
for
ouvrard
gindriez
and
wyld
they
were
kind
and
open
and
had
experience
therefore
they
were
interesting
my
uncles
in
lancashire
had
no
doubt
been
kind
in
their
own
way
that
is
in
welcoming
me
to
their
houses
but
they
were
both
excessively
reserved
being
at
that
time
deeply
interested
in
france
i
was
delighted
to
find
a
man
like
gindriez
who
could
give
me
endless
information
his
chief
interest
in
life
lay
in
french
politics
art
and
literature
being
for
him
subjects
of
secondary
concern
but
by
no
means
of
indifference
and
the
plain
truth
is
that
he
had
a
better
and
clearer
conception
of
art
than
i
myself
had
in
those
days
or
for
long
afterwards
there
was
also
for
me
a
personal
magnetism
in
gindriez
which
it
was
not
easy
to
account
for
then
but
which
is
now
quite
intelligible
to
me
he
had
in
the
utmost
strength
and
purity
the
genuine
heroic
nature
i
came
to
understand
this
in
after
years
and
believe
that
it
impressed
me
from
the
first
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
about
this
remarkable
character
in
this
place
because
the
reader
will
hear
much
of
him
afterwards
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
was
attracted
by
his
powers
of
conversation
and
his
evident
tenderness
of
heart
when
we
had
become
better
acquainted
gindriez
invited
me
to
spend
an
evening
at
his
house
after
dinner
and
i
went
he
was
living
at
that
time
on
a
boulevard
outside
the
first
wall
which
has
since
been
demolished
his
was
simply
furnished
and
not
strikingly
different
in
any
way
from
the
usual
dwellings
of
the
parisian
middle
class
i
had
now
been
absent
for
some
weeks
from
anything
like
a
home
and
after
living
in
hotels
it
was
pleasant
to
find
myself
at
a
domestic
fireside
gindriez
had
several
children
the
eldest
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
extremely
modest
and
retiring
as
a
generally
is
in
france
and
there
was
another
daughter
very
pretty
and
engaging
but
scarcely
more
than
a
child
there
were
also
two
boys
the
eldest
a
very
taciturn
studious
lad
who
was
at
that
time
at
the
college
of
sainte
barbe
their
mother
had
been
a
woman
of
remarkable
beauty
and
still
retained
enough
of
it
to
attract
the
eye
of
a
painter
she
had
also
at
times
a
certain
unconscious
grace
and
dignity
of
pose
that
the
great
old
italian
masters
valued
more
than
it
is
valued
now
gindriez
himself
had
a
refined
face
but
my
interest
in
him
was
due
almost
entirely
to
the
charm
and
ease
of
his
conversation
in
writing
an
autobiography
one
ought
to
give
impressions
as
they
were
received
at
the
time
and
not
as
they
may
have
been
modified
afterwards
i
am
still
quite
able
to
recall
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
eldest
daughter
in
the
beginning
of
i
did
not
think
her
so
pretty
as
her
sister
though
she
had
a
healthy
complexion
with
bright
eyes
and
remarkably
beautiful
teeth
whilst
her
slight
figure
was
graceful
and
well
formed
but
i
well
remember
being
pleased
and
interested
by
the
little
glimpses
i
could
get
of
her
mind
and
character
it
was
a
new
sort
of
character
to
me
and
even
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
there
was
something
that
indicated
a
rare
union
of
strength
and
tenderness
the
tenderness
of
course
was
not
for
me
a
foreign
temporary
guest
in
those
days
but
i
found
it
out
by
the
girl
way
of
speaking
to
her
father
i
perceived
too
under
an
exterior
of
cheerfulness
rising
at
times
to
gayety
a
nature
that
was
really
serious
as
if
saddened
by
a
too
early
experience
of
trouble
the
truth
was
that
in
consequence
of
her
father
checkered
career
this
girl
of
sixteen
had
passed
through
a
much
greater
variety
of
experience
than
most
women
have
known
at
thirty
her
mother
too
had
for
some
time
suffered
almost
continuously
from
so
that
the
eldest
daughter
had
been
really
the
active
mistress
of
the
house
her
courage
and
resolution
had
been
put
to
the
test
in
various
ways
that
i
knew
nothing
about
then
but
the
effects
of
an
uncommon
experience
were
that
deepening
of
the
young
nature
which
made
it
especially
interesting
to
me
afterwards
i
discovered
that
eug√©nie
gindriez
had
read
more
and
thought
more
than
other
girls
of
her
age
this
might
have
been
almost
an
evil
in
a
quiet
life
but
hers
had
not
been
a
quiet
life
we
soon
became
friends
in
spite
of
the
french
conventional
idea
that
a
girl
should
not
open
her
lips
but
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
we
were
likely
ever
to
be
anything
more
than
friends
had
the
idea
occurred
the
obstacle
of
a
difference
in
nationality
would
have
seemed
to
me
absolutely
insuperable
i
thought
of
marriage
at
that
time
as
a
possibility
but
not
of
an
international
marriage
in
fact
the
difficulties
attending
upon
an
international
marriage
are
so
considerable
and
the
subsequent
practical
inconvenience
so
troublesome
that
only
an
ardently
passionate
and
imprudent
nature
could
overlook
them
i
for
my
part
left
paris
without
being
aware
that
mademoiselle
gindriez
had
anything
to
do
with
my
future
destiny
but
she
with
a
woman
perspicacity
knew
better
she
thought
it
at
least
probable
if
not
certain
that
i
should
return
after
long
years
she
waited
patiently
and
when
at
last
i
did
return
there
was
no
need
to
tell
on
what
errand
an
incident
occurred
that
might
have
been
a
partial
revelation
to
me
and
a
clear
one
to
her
before
my
departure
from
paris
ouvrard
said
to
me
that
he
had
been
told
i
was
engaged
to
une
fran√ßaise
what
is
her
name
he
mentioned
another
young
lady
now
to
this
day
i
remember
that
when
he
spoke
of
a
french
marriage
as
a
possibility
for
me
i
at
once
saw
mentally
a
portrait
of
eug√©nie
gindriez
however
as
a
french
marriage
was
a
possibility
i
thought
no
more
of
the
matter

return
value
of
the
french
language
to
me
being
entirely
absorbed
in
the
study
of
french
during
my
first
visit
to
paris
i
did
little
in
the
practice
of
art
my
lancashire
neighbor
who
was
studying
in
paris
worked
in
colin
atelier
and
i
have
since
regretted
that
i
did
not
at
that
time
get
myself
entered
there
the
more
so
that
it
was
a
decent
and
quiet
place
kept
under
the
eye
of
the
master
himself
who
had
long
been
accustomed
to
teaching
my
friend
had
certainly
made
good
progress
there
i
was
unfortunately
influenced
by
two
erroneous
ideas
one
of
them
being
that
the
studies
of
a
could
be
of
no
use
in
landscape
footnote
this
idea
had
been
strongly
confirmed
by
mr
pettitt
and
the
other
that
it
was
wiser
to
be
a
specialist
and
devote
myself
to
landscape
exclusively
it
is
surprising
that
the
notion
of
a
limited
speciality
in
painting
should
have
taken
possession
of
me
then
as
in
other
matters
i
have
never
been
a
narrow
specialist
or
had
any
tendency
to
become
one
the
choice
of
a
narrow
speciality
may
be
good
in
the
industrial
arts
but
it
is
not
good
in
painting
for
the
reason
that
a
painter
may
at
any
time
desire
to
include
something
in
his
picture
which
a
specialist
could
not
deal
with
to
feel
as
if
the
world
belonged
to
him
a
painter
ought
to
be
able
to
paint
everything
he
sees
there
is
another
sense
in
which
speciality
may
be
good
it
may
be
good
to
keep
to
one
of
the
graphic
arts
in
order
to
effect
that
intimate
union
between
the
man
and
his
instrument
which
is
hardly
possible
on
any
other
terms
wyld
would
have
taught
me
if
i
had
asked
him
and
i
did
at
a
later
period
study
with
him
but
his
practice
in
oil
did
not
suit
me
for
this
reason
it
was
entirely
tentative
he
was
constantly
demolishing
his
work
so
that
it
was
hard
to
see
how
a
pupil
could
possibly
follow
him
the
advantage
in
working
under
his
eye
would
have
been
in
receiving
a
great
variety
of
sound
artistic
ideas
for
few
painters
know
more
about
as
distinguished
from
nature
however
by
mere
conversation
wyld
has
communicated
to
me
a
great
deal
of
this
knowledge
and
with
regard
to
the
practical
advantages
of
painting
like
him
they
would
probably
not
have
ensured
me
any
better
commercial
success
as
his
style
of
painting
has
now
for
a
long
time
been
completely
out
of
fashion
my
scheme
in
was
to
make
a
great
slow
boat
voyage
on
the
loire
with
the
purpose
of
collecting
a
quantity
of
sketches
and
studies
in
illustration
of
that
river
and
my
ardor
in
learning
to
speak
french
had
for
an
immediate
motive
the
desire
to
make
that
voyage
without
an
interpreter
i
have
often
regretted
that
this
scheme
was
never
carried
out
i
have
since
done
something
of
the
same
kind
for
the
sa√¥ne
but
my
situation
is
now
entirely
different
i
am
now
obliged
to
make
all
my
undertakings
which
limits
them
terribly
and
almost
entirely
prevents
me
from
doing
anything
on
a
great
scale
for
example
these
pages
are
written
within
a
few
miles
of
loire
side
the
river
that
flows
near
my
home
is
a
tributary
of
the
loire
i
have
all
the
material
outfit
necessary
for
a
great
boating
expedition
and
still
keep
the
strength
and
the
will
but
no
publisher
could
prudently
undertake
the
illustration
of
a
river
so
long
as
the
loire
and
so
rich
in
material
on
the
scale
that
i
contemplated
in
it
is
unnecessary
to
trouble
the
reader
with
my
crude
impressions
of
european
painting
in
the
universal
exhibition
of
that
year
i
no
more
understood
french
art
at
that
time
than
a
frenchman
newly
transplanted
to
london
can
understand
english
art
the
two
schools
require
in
fact
different
mental
adjustments
our
national
gallery
had
sufficiently
prepared
me
for
the
louvre
which
i
visited
very
frequently
and
there
i
laid
the
foundations
of
a
sort
of
knowledge
which
became
of
great
use
many
years
afterwards
though
for
a
long
time
there
was
nothing
to
show
for
it
no
historical
event
of
importance
occurred
during
my
stay
in
paris
except
the
birth
of
the
prince
imperial
i
was
awakened
by
the
cannon
at
the
invalides
and
having
been
told
that
if
there
were
more
than
guns
the
child
would
be
a
boy
i
counted
till
the
and
then
fell
asleep
again
there
existed
even
then
the
most
complete
scepticism
as
to
the
transmission
of
the
crown
neither
gindriez
nor
any
other
intelligent
frenchman
that
i
met
believed
that
the
newly
born
infant
had
the
faintest
chance
of
ever
occupying
the
throne
of
france
before
the
child
birth
i
had
seen
his
father
and
mother
and
all
his
relations
at
the
closing
ceremony
of
the
universal
exhibition
and
thought
them
with
the
exception
of
the
empress
a
set
of
people
they
walked
round
the
oblong
arena
in
the
palais
de
exactly
as
circus
people
do
round
the
track
at
the
hippodrome
the
most
interesting
figure
was
old
jerome
interesting
not
for
himself
as
he
was
a
nonentity
but
as
the
brother
of
the
most
famous
conqueror
since
caesar
being
called
back
to
england
on
a
matter
of
business
i
cut
short
my
stay
in
paris
and
arrived
at
hollins
without
having
advanced
much
as
an
artist
but
with
an
important
linguistic
acquirement
the
value
of
french
to
me
from
a
professional
point
of
view
is
quite
incalculable
the
best
french
criticism
on
the
fine
arts
is
the
most
discriminating
and
the
most
accurate
in
the
world
at
least
when
it
is
not
turned
aside
from
truth
by
the
national
jealousy
of
england
and
the
consequent
antipathy
to
english
art
at
the
same
time
there
are
qualities
of
delicacy
and
precision
in
french
prose
which
it
was
good
for
me
to
appreciate
even
imperfectly

having

and

i
remained
working
in
the
north
of

discouraged
as
to
literature
by
the
failure
of
the
book
of
verse
and
without
much
encouragement
for
painting
either
so
the
summer
of
was
not
very
fruitful
in
work
of
any
kind
towards
autumn
however
i
took
courage
again
and
determined
to
paint
from
nature
on
the
moors
this
led
to
the
first
attempt
at
encamping
it
is
wonderful
what
an
influence
the
things
we
do
in
early
life
may
have
on
our
future
occupations
in
exactly
thirty
years
later
i
made
the

expedition
for
which
two
qualifications
were
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
french
language
and
a
practical
acquaintance
with
encamping
the
roman
who
said
that
fifteen
years
made
a
long
space
in
human
life
would
have
appreciated
the
importance
of
thirty
yet
across
all
that
space
of
time
what
i
did
in
told
just
as
effectually
as
if
it
had
been
done
the
year
before
for
any
young
man
who
may
read
this
book
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
important
the
deeds
of
may
turn
out
to
have
been
when
we
look
back
upon
them
in
complete
maturity
all
we
know
about
them
is
that
they
are
likely
to
be
recognized
in
the
future
as
far
more
important
than
they
seemed
when
they
were
in
the
present
encamping
is
now
quite
familiar
to
young
englishmen
in
connection
with
boating
excursions
and
it
has
even
been
adopted
in
american
pine
forests
for
the
sake
of
health
but
in
only
military
men
and
a
few
travellers
knew
anything
about
encampments
i
was
led
into
this
art
or
amusement
for
it
is
both
by
a
very
natural
transition
here
are
the
three
stages
of
it
you
want
to
paint
from
nature
in
uncertain
weather
and
you
build
a
hut
for
shelter
the
hut
is
at
some
distance
from
a
house
and
you
do
not
like
to
leave
it
so
you
sleep
in
it
the
accommodation
is
found
to
be
narrow
and
it
is
unpleasant
to
have
one
little
room
for
everything
so
you
add
a
tent
or
two
outside
and
keep
a
man
hence
a
complete
little
encampment
everybody
considered
me
extremely
eccentric
in
because
i
was
led
into
encamping
but
it
was
an
excellent
thing
for
me
in
various
ways
a
young
man
given
up
to
such
pursuits
as
literature
and
art
needs
a
closer
contact
with
common
realities
than
aesthetic
studies
can
give
the
physical
work
attendant
upon
encamping
and
the
constant
attention
that
be
given
to
such
pressing
necessities
as
shelter
and
food
give
exactly
that
contact
with
reality
that
educates
us
in
readiness
of
resource
and
they
have
the
incalculable
advantage
of
making
one
learn
the
difference
between
the
necessary
and
the
superfluous
i
look
back
upon
early
camping
experiments
with
satisfaction
as
an
experience
of
the
greatest
educational
value
even
now
in
my
sixth
decade
i
can
sleep
under
canvas
and
arrange
all
the
details
of
a
camp
with
indescribable
enjoyment
and
what
is
perhaps
better
still
i
can
put
up
cheerfully
with
the
very
humblest
accommodation
in
country
inns
provided
only
that
they
are
tolerably
clean
the
arrangements
of
my
hut
on
the
moor
near
burnley
have
been
described
in
detail
in
the
painter
camp
so
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
a
minute
account
of
them
in
this
place
i
was
entirely
alone
except
the
company
of
a
dog
and
had
no
defence
but
a
revolver
that
month
of
solitude
on
the
wild
hills
was
a
singularly
happy
time
so
happy
that
it
is
not
easy
without
some
reflection
to
account
for
such
a
degree
of
felicity
i
was
young
and
the
brisk
mountain
air
exhilarated
me
i
walked
out
every
day
on
the
heather
which
i
loved
as
if
my
father
and
mother
had
been
a
brace
of
grouse
then
there
was
the
steady
occupation
of
painting
a
big
foreground
study
from
nature
and
the
necessary
camp
work
that
would
have
kept
morbid
ideas
at
a
distance
if
any
such
had
been
likely
to
trouble
me
as
for
the
solitude
and
the
silence
broken
only
by
wind
and
rain
their
effect
was
not
depressing
in
the
least
towns
are
depressing
to
me
even
paris
has
that
effect
but
how
is
it
possible
to
feel
otherwise
than
cheerful
when
you
have
leagues
of
fragrant
heather
all
around
you
and
blue
yorkshire
hills
on
the
high
and
far
horizon
a
noteworthy
effect
of
this
month
on
the
moors
was
that
on
returning
to
hollins
which
was
situated
amongst
trim
green
pastures
and
plantations
everything
seemed
so
astonishingly
artificial
it
came
with
the
force
of
a
discovery
from
that
day
to
this
the
natural
and
the
artificial
in
landscape
have
been
for
me
as
clearly
distinguished
as
a
wild
boar
from
a
domestic
pig
my
strong
preference
was
and
still
is
for
wild
nature
the
unfortunate
effects
of
this
preference
as
regards
success
in
will
claim
our
attention
later
the
grand
scheme
for
an
exhibition
of
art
treasures
at
manchester
in
suggested
to
sir
james
kay
shuttleworth
the
idea
of
having
an
exhibition
at
burnley
in
the
same
year
to
illustrate
the
history
of
lancashire
he
thought
that
a
certain
proportion
of
the
visitors
to
the
manchester
art
treasures
would
probably
be
induced
to
visit
our
but
prosperous
and
rising
town
his
scheme
was
of
a
very
comprehensive
character
and
included
a
pictorial
illustration
of
lancashire
there
would
have
been
pictures
of
lancashire
scenery
as
well
as
portraits
of
men
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
the
history
of
the
county
and
whose
fame
has
in
many
instances
gone
far
beyond
its
borders
all
the
mechanical
inventions
that
have
enriched
lancashire
would
also
have
been
represented
having
thought
this
over
in
his
own
mind
sir
james
wanted
an
active
lieutenant
to
aid
him
in
carrying
his
idea
into
execution
and
as
he
knew
me
he
asked
me
to
be
the
practical
manager
of
the
exhibition
i
was
to
travel
all
over
the
county
see
all
the
people
of
importance
and
borrow
whenever
possible
such
of
their
pictures
and
other
relics
as
might
be
considered
illustrative
of
lancashire
history
sir
james
had
many
influential
friends
i
myself
had
a
few
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
by
devoting
my
time
to
the
scheme
heartily
i
might
make
it
a
success
my
reward
was
to
be
simply
a
very
interesting
experience
as
i
should
see
almost
all
the
interesting
things
and
people
in
my
native
county
sir
james
did
his
best
to
entice
me
and
as
he
was
a
very
able
man
with
much
knowledge
of
the
world
he
might
possibly
have
succeeded
had
i
not
been
more
than
usually
wary
luckily
i
felt
the
whole
weight
of
my
inexperience
and
said
to
myself
whatever
we
do
it
is
that
mistakes
will
be
committed
and
very
probable
that
some
things
will
be
damaged
all
mistakes
will
be
laid
to
my
door
then
the
exhibition
itself
may
be
a
failure
and
it
is
disagreeable
to
be
conspicuously
connected
with
a
failure
i
next
consulted
one
or
two
experienced
friends
who
said
sir
james
will
have
the
credit
of
any
success
there
may
be
and
you
as
a
young
useful
person
comparatively
unknown
will
get
very
little
whilst
at
the
same
time
you
will
be
burdened
with
heavy
anxieties
and
responsibilities
i
therefore
firmly
declined
and
as
sir
james
could
not
find
any
other
suitable
assistant
his
project
was
never
reaped
it
seems
odd
that
the
existence
of
this
lancashire
exhibition
should
have
depended
on
the
yes
or
no
of
a
lad
of
yet
so
it
did
for
if
i
had
consented
the
scheme
would
certainly
have
been
carried
into
execution
whether
successfully
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
enterprise
would
have
greatly
interested
and
occupied
me
for
i
have
a
natural
turn
for
organizing
things
being
fond
of
order
and
details
and
i
should
have
learned
a
great
deal
and
seen
many
people
and
many
houses
still
the
negative
decision
was
the
wiser
sir
james
kay
shuttleworth
was
certainly
one
of
the
remarkable
people
i
have
known
at
that
time
he
was
unpopular
in
burnley
on
account
of
his
separation
from
his
wife
who
had
been
the
richest
heiress
in
the
neighborhood
the
owner
of
a
fine
estate
and
a
grand
old
hall
at
gawthorpe
people
thought
she
had
been
of
this
i
really
know
of
my
own
knowledge
absolutely
nothing
and
shall
print
no
hearsays
sir
james
himself
was
an
ambitious
and
very
man
who
passed
through
life
with
no
desire
for
repose
public
education
in
the
days
before
board
schools
was
his
especial
subject
and
he
owed
his
baronetcy
to
his
efforts
in
that
cause
the
tory
aristocracy
of
the
neighborhood
disliked
him
for
his
liberal
principles
in
politics
and
for
his
brilliant
marriage
which
came
about
because
the
heiress
of
gawthorpe
took
an
interest
in
his
own
subjects
perhaps
too
they
were
not
quite
pleased
with
his
too
active
and
restless
intellect
he
made
one
or
two
attempts
to
win
a
position
as
a
novelist
but
in
connection
with
literature
future
generations
will
know
him
chiefly
as
the
kind
host
of
charlotte
bront√´
who
visited
him
at
gawthorpe
i
regret
now
that
i
never
met
charlotte
bront√´
as
she
was
quite
a
near
neighbor
of
ours
in
fact
i
could
have
ridden
or
walked
over
to
haworth
at
any
time
that
village
is
just
on
the
northeast
border
of
the
great
boulsworth
moors
where
my
hut
was
pitched
at
the
time
of
my
encampment
there
charlotte
bront√´
had
been
dead
about
eighteen
months
she
was
hardly
a
contemporary
of
mine
as
she
was
born
seventeen
years
before
me
and
died
so
prematurely
still
when
i
think
that
jane
eyre
was
written
within
a
very
few
miles
of
hollins
footnote
i
have
not
access
to
an
ordnance
map
but
believe
that
the
distance
was
hardly
more
than
eight
miles
across
the
moors
haworth
is
only
twelve
miles
from
burnley
by
road
and
that
for
several
years
during
which
i
rode
or
walked
every
day
charlotte
bront√´
was
living
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
moors
visible
from
my
home
i
am
vexed
with
myself
for
not
having
had
assurance
enough
to
go
to
see
her
since
those
days
a
hundred
ephemeral
reputations
have
risen
only
to
be
quenched
forever
in
the
great
ocean
of
the
world
oblivion
but
the
fame
of
jane
eyre
is
as
brilliant
as
it
was
when
the
book
astonished
all
reading
england
forty
years
ago
footnote
i
am
writing
in
amongst
the
distinguished
people
belonging
to
the
neighborhood
of
burnley
was
general
scarlett
who
led
the
charge
of
the
heavy
cavalry
at
balaclava
brilliant
feat
of
arms
much
more
satisfactory
to
military
men
than
the
fruitless
sacrifice
of
the
light
brigade
which
however
is
incomparably
better
known
i
recollect
general
scarlett
chiefly
because
he
set
me
thinking
about
a
very
important
question
in
political
economy
i
happened
to
be
sitting
next
him
at
dinner
when
the
talk
turned
upon
wine
and
the
general
said
the
radicals
find
fault
with
the
economy
of
the
queen
household
because
they
say
that
the
wine
drunk
there
costs
sixteen
thousand
a
year
i
do
know
what
it
costs
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
i
then
timidly
inquired
if
he
did
not
think
it
was
a
waste
of
money
on
which
in
a
kind
way
he
explained
to
me
that
if
the
money
were
paid
and
put
into
circulation
it
did
not
signify
what
it
had
been
spent
upon
i
knew
there
was
something
fallacious
in
this
but
my
own
ideas
were
not
clear
upon
the
subject
and
it
did
not
become
me
to
set
up
an
argument
with
a
distinguished
old
officer
like
the
general
of
course
the
right
answer
is
that
there
is
always
a
responsibility
for
spending
money
so
as
to
be
of
use
not
only
to
the
tradesman
who
pockets
it
to
the
consumers
if
the
wine
gave
health
and
wisdom
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
spend
too
much
upon
it

in

of
these

the
exact
date
is
of
no
consequence
i
visited
the
old
houses
in
yorkshire
which
had
belonged
to
our
family
in
former
times
the
place
we
take
our
name
from
hamerton
belonged
to
richard
de
hamerton
in
i
found
the
old
hall
still
in
existence
or
a
part
of
it
and
though
the
present
building
evidently
does
not
date
from
the
twelfth
century
it
dates
from
the
occupation
of
my
forefathers
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
was
some
very
massive
oak
wainscot
still
remaining
the
situation
is
to
my
taste
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
england
the
house
is
on
a
hill
from
which
it
looks
down
on
the
valley
of
slaidburn
steep
green
pastures
slope
to
the
flat
meadows
in
the
lower
ground
which
are
watered
by
a
stream
there
are
many
places
of
that
character
in
yorkshire
and
they
have
never
lost
their
old
charm
for
me
i
can
not
do
without
a
hill
and
a
stream
and
a
green
field
footnote
since
this
was
written
i
have
been
compelled
to
do
without
them
by
the
necessity
for
living
close
to
an
a
necessity
against
which
i
rebelled
as
long
as
i
could
even
however
i
would
joyously
give
all
paris
for
such
a
place
as
hollins
or
hamerton
as
i
knew
them
with
their
streams
and
pastures
and
near
or
distant
hills
my
forefathers
lived
at
hamerton
more
or
less
from
a
time
of
which
there
is
no
record
down
to
the
reign
of
henry
but
their
principal
seat
in
the
time
of
their
greatest
prosperity
was
wigglesworth
hall
i
arrived
there
in
time
to
see
masons
demolishing
the
building
one
or
two
gothic
arched
still
remained
but
were
probably
destroyed
the
next
week
just
enough
of
the
house
was
preserved
to
shelter
the
occupant
of
the
farm
for
me
this
unnecessary
destruction
is
always
distressing
even
in
foreign
countries
it
is
excusable
in
towns
where
land
is
dear
but
in
the
country
the
site
of
an
old
hall
is
of
such
trifling
value
that
it
might
surely
be
permitted
to
fall
peaceably
to
ruin
the
family
of
de
arches
to
which
wigglesworth
originally
belonged
bore
for
arms
three
arches
the
coincidence
struck
me
forcibly
when
i
saw
the
gothic
arches
still
standing
amongst
the
ruins
the
place
came
into
the
possession
of
our
family
by
the
marriage
of
adam
de

in
the
fourteenth
century
with
katharine
heiress
of
elias
de
knoll
of
knolsmere
his
father
reginald
de
knoll
had
married
beatrix
de
arches
heiress
of
the
manor
of
wigglesworth
these
estates
with
others
too
numerous
to
mention
remained
in
our
family
till
they
were
lost
by
the
attainder
of
sir
stephen
hamerton
who
joined
the
insurrection
known
as
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
during
these
excursions
to
old
houses
i
visited
hellifield
peel
still
belonging
to
the
chief
of
our
little
clan
the
peel
is
an
old
border
tower
embattled
and
with
walls
of
great
thickness
it
is
large
enough
to
make
a
tolerably
spacious
but
not
very
convenient
modern
house
and
my
great
uncle
spoiled
its
external
appearance
by
inserting
london
sash
windows
in
the
gray
old
fortress
wall
on
this
occasion
i
did
not
see
the
interior
not
desiring
to
claim
a
relationship
that
had
fallen
into
abeyance
for
yet
i
felt
the
most
intense
curiosity
about
it
and
for
more
than
twenty
years
afterwards
i
dreamed
from
time
to
time
i
got
inside
the
peel
and
saw
quite
a
museum
of
knightly
armor
footnote
the
first
sir
stephen
hamerton
was
made
a
knight
banneret
in
scotland
by
richard
duke
of
gloucester
in
the
reign
of
edward

he
married
isabel

a
letter

memorials
which
i
regret
to
say
have
not
been
preserved
in
reality
hellifield
peel
was
built
by
laurence
hamerton
in
when
the
second
sir
stephen
was
executed
for
high
treason
and
his
possessions
confiscated
the
manor
of
hellifield
was
preserved
by
a
settlement
for
his
mother
during
her
life
after
that
it
was
granted
by
the
king
to
one
george
browne
of
whom
we
know
nothing
positively
except
that
he
lived
at
calais
and
after
changing
hands
several
times
it
came
back
into
the
hamerton
family
by
a
fine
levied
in

passed
the

is
said
to
have
been
interred
in

the
day
when
his
father
was
beheaded
in
london
whitaker
thought
it
not
improbable
that
he
died
of
a
broken
heart
in
consequence
of
the
ruin
of
his
family
henry
left
no
male
issue
the
career
of
sir
stephen
seems
to
have
been
doomed
to
misfortune
for
there
were
influences
that
might
have
saved
him
he
had
been
in
the
train
of
the
earl
of
cumberland
the
same
who
afterwards
held
skipton
castle
against
the
rebels
whitaker
says
he
forsook
his
patron
in
the
hour
of
trial
this
seems
rather
a
harsh
way
of
judging
a
catholic
who
believed
himself
to
be
fighting
for
god
and
his
spoliated
church
against
a
tyrannical
king
i
notice
that
in
our
own
day
the
french
republican
government
can
not
take
the
smallest
measure
against
the
religious
houses
can
not
even
require
them
to
obey
the
ordinary
law
of
the
country
but
there
is
immediately
an
outcry
in
all
the
english
newspapers
yet
the
measures
of
the
third
republic
have
been
to
those
of
henry
viii
what
that
same
third
republic
is
to
the
first
all
that
can
be
fairly
urged
against
sir
stephen
hamerton
is
that
after
having
availed
himself
of
the
king
pardon
he
revolted
a
second
time
there
is
nothing
else
that
i
remember
in
the
history
of
our
family
that
is
likely
to
have
any
interest
for
readers
who
do
not
belong
to
it
sir
richard
hamerton
of
hamerton
married
in
a
sister
of
the
bloody
lord
clifford
who
was
slain
at
towton
field
and
that
is
the
nearest
connection
that
we
have
ever
had
with
any
historical
character
through
marriages
we
are
descended
in
female
lines
from
many
historical
personages
footnote
some
in
the
extinct
peerage
and
others
belonging
to
royal
families
of
england
and
france
which
have
since
lost
their
thrones
by
revolution
a
matter
of
no
interest
to
the
reader
though
i
acknowledge
enough
of
the
ancestral
sentiment
to
have
my
own
interest
in
them
quickened
by
my
descent
from
them
another
consequence
of
belonging
to
a
old
family
was
that
i
sometimes
in
my
youth
met
with
people
who
were
related
to
me
and
who
were
aware
of
it
although
the
relationship
was
very
distant
i
recollect
for
instance
that
one
of
the
officers
in
our
militia
regiment
remembered
his
descent
from
our
family
and
though
i
had
never
seen
him
before
it
was
a
sort
of
between
us
the
hamertons
do
not
seem
to
have
distinguished
themselves
in
anything
except
marrying
heiresses
and
in
that
they
were
remarkably
successful
at
first
a
moderately
wealthy
family
they
became
immensely
wealthy
by
the
accumulation
of
heiresses
estates
and
after
being
ruined
by
confiscation
they
began
the
same
process
over
again
but
being
at
the
same
time
either
imprudent
or
careless
or
too
much
burdened
with
children
my
had
a
dozen
brothers
and
sisters
they
have
not
kept
their
lands
one
of
my
uncles
said
to
me
that
the
hamertons
won
property
in
no
other
way
than
by
marriage
and
that
they
were
almost
incapable
of
retaining
it
he
himself
had
the
one
talent
of
his
race
but
was
an
exception
to
their
incapacity
in
justice
to
our
family
i
may
add
that
we
are
said
to
make
indulgent
husbands
and
fathers
two
characters
incompatible
with
avarice
and
sometimes
even
with
prudence
when
the
circumstances
are
not
easy
on
a
later
occasion
i
made
a
little
tour
in
craven
with
a
friend
who
had
a
tandem
and
we
stopped
at
hellifield
where
i
sketched
the
peel
whilst
i
sat
at
work
the
then
representative
of
the
family
my
first
cousin
came
out
upon
the
lawn
but
i
did
not
speak
to
him
nor
did
he
take
any
notice
of
me
he
was
a
fine
hale
man
of
about
eighty
the
of
hellifield
to
hollins
was
brought
home
to
me
very
strongly
on
that
occasion
it
was
late
afternoon
when
i
finished
my
sketch
and
yet
as
we
had
very
good
horses
we
reached
home
easily
the
same
evening
so
near
and
yet
so
far
as
i
have
said
already
in
the
third
chapter
my
grandfather
wife
and
children
never
even
saw
his
brother
house
and
during
my
own
youth
the
place
had
seemed
as
distant
and
unreal
as
one
of
the
old
towers
that
i
had
read
about
in
northern
poetry
and
romance
chapter
xxx
expedition
to
the
highlands
in
kindness
of
the
marquis
of
breadalbane
and
camp
life
its
strong
and
peculiar
my
young
scant
supplies
in
the
nature
of
the
necessity
for
wooden
floors
in
a
bad
practice
of
changes
of
influences
that
governed
my
way
of
study
in
those
attractive
character
of
the
scottish
their
scenery
not
well
adapted
for
my
intense
love
of
it
in
the
year
i
made
the
expedition
to
the
highlands
which
afterwards
became
well
known
in
consequence
of
my
book
about
it
the
marquis
of
breadalbane
the
first
marquis
granted
me
in
the
kindest
way
permission
to
pitch
my
camp
wherever
i
liked
on
his
extensive
estate
and
at
the
same
time
gave
me
an
invitation
to
taymouth
castle
the
duke
of
argyll
gave
me
leave
to
encamp
on
an
island
in
loch
awe
that
belonged
to
him
and
campbell
of
monzie
granted
leave
to
encamp
on
his
property
on
the
cladich
side
of
the
lake
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
taymouth
to
thank
lord
breadalbane
and
accept
the
hospitality
he
had
offered
but
it
happened
that
he
had
not
fixed
a
date
so
i
avoided
taymouth
this
was
wrong
but
young
men
are
generally
either
forward
or
backward
the
marquis
afterwards
expressed
himself
to
a
third
person
as
rather
hurt
that
i
had
not
been
to
see
him
my
advice
to
any
young
man
who
reads
this
book
is
always
to
that
he
appreciates
kindness
when
it
is
offered
there
is
not
very
much
of
it
in
the
world
but
there
is
some
and
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
feel
grateful
we
ought
to
accept
kindness
with
visible
satisfaction
one
of
my
regrets
now
is
to
have
sometimes
failed
in
this
usually
out
of
mere
shyness
particularly
where
great
people
were
concerned
here
is
another
instance
when
going
to
inverary
on
the
steamer
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
pleasant
scotchman
who
turned
out
to
be
the
laird
of
lamont
on
loch
fyne
side
he
took
an
interest
in
my
artistic
projects
and
very
kindly
invited
me
to
go
and
see
him
nothing
would
have
been
easier
i
was
as
free
as
a
fish
and
might
have
sailed
down
loch
fyne
any
day
on
my
own
boat
yet
i
never
went
the
book
called
a
painter
camp
gave
a
sufficient
account
of
my
first
summer
in
the
highlands
which
was
not
distinguished
by
much
variety
as
i
remained
almost
exclusively
at
loch
awe
but
the
novelty
of
camp
life
seems
to
have
interested
many
readers
though
they
must
have
been
already
perfectly
familiar
with
camp
life
in
the
practice
of
armies
and
the
experience
of
african
travellers
the
true
explanation
of
my
proceedings
is
the
intense
and
peculiar
charm
that
there
is
about
encamping
in
a
wild
and
picturesque
country
i
had
tasted
this
on
the
lancashire
moors
and
i
wanted
to
taste
it
again
just
now
whilst
writing
i
have
on
my
table
a
letter
from
an
english
official
in
africa
who
tells
me
of
his
camp
life
he
says
the
wagon
was
generally
my
sleeping
quarter
i
had
two
tents
and
a
riding
horse
and
very
seldom
slept
in
a
house
or
put
the
horse
in
a
stable
a
life
was
ever
and
is
now
to
me
the
acme
of
bliss
no
man
can
be
said
to
have
really
lived
who
has
not
camped
out
in
some
such
way
and
i
know
well
that
you
especially
will
say
amen
to
this
since
i
have
lived
altogether
for
about
six
years
in
the
open
and
have
never
caught
a
cold
only
through
imprudent
uncovering
of
the
head
once
in
whilst
drawing
the
topography
of
a
mountain
i
was
struck
down
by
sunstroke
the
reasons
for
this
intense
attraction
in
camp
life
are
probably
complex
one
certainly
is
that
it
brings
us
nearer
to
nature
but
a
still
deeper
reason
may
be
that
revives
obscure
associations
that
belong
to
the
memory
of
the
race
and
not
to
that
of
the
camping
is
in
the
same
category
with
yachting
fishing
and
the
chase
a
thing
practised
by
civilized
man
for
his
amusement
because
it
permits
him
to
resume
the
habits
of
less
civilized
generations
the
delight
of
encamping
for
a
young
man
in
vigorous
health
is
the
enforced
activity
in
the
open
air
that
is
inseparably
connected
with
it
i
had
only
one
servant
a
young
man
from
the
moorland
country
on
the
borders
of
lancashire
and
yorkshire
perfectly
well
adapted
to
life
in
the
highlands
he
had
excellent
health
and
was
physically
a
good
specimen
of
our
race
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
his
tall
straight
figure
going
over
the
roughest
ground
with
no
appearance
of
hurry
but
in
fact
with
such
unostentatious
swiftness
that
few
sportsmen
could
follow
him
i
was
myself
active
enough
then
and
accustomed
to
wild
places
but
he
always
restrained
himself
when
we
did
any
mountain
work
together
he
afterwards
became
well
known
as
the
thursday
of
the
painter
camp
but
i
may
give
his
real
name
here
which
was
young
helliwell
temperate
hardy
and
extremely
prudent
not
to
be
caught
by
any
allurements
of
vulgar
pleasure
he
lived
wisely
in
youth
and
will
probably
have
fewer
regrets
than
most
people
in
his
old
age
young
had
studied
the
art
of
simple
cookery
at
hollins
so
he
was
able
to
keep
me
tolerably
well
when
we
happened
to
have
anything
to
eat
which
was
not
always
there
were
no
provision
shops
on
lochaweside
inverary
was
at
some
distance
in
one
direction
and
oban
in
the
other
and
as
i
had
never
given
a
thought
to
feeding
before
i
was
an
utterly
incompetent
provider
the
consequence
was
that
we
fasted
like
monks
except
that
our
abstinence
was
not
on
any
regular
principle
in
fact
sometimes
we
had
so
little
to
eat
for
days
together
that
we
began
to
feel
quite
weak
this
gave
us
no
anxiety
and
we
only
laughed
at
it
undereating
being
always
more
conducive
to
good
spirits
than
its
opposite
provided
that
it
is
not
carried
too
far
the
camp
consisted
of
three
structures
my
hut
which
was
made
of
wooden
panels
with
windows
a
tent
for
young
with
a
wooden
floor
and
wooden
sides
to
the
height
of
three
feet
lastly
a
military
that
served
for
storing
things
my
hut
was
both
and
habitation
but
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
had
a
separate
on
rather
a
larger
scale
herkomer
afterwards
imitated
the
hut
for
painting
from
nature
in
wales
and
he
introduced
a
clever
improvement
by
erecting
his
hut
on
a
circular
platform
with
a
so
that
it
could
be
turned
at
will
to
any
point
of
the
compass
tent
was
in
fact
also
a
kind
of
hut
with
a
square
tent
for
a
roof
in
a
climate
like
that
of
the
west
highlands
wooden
floors
at
least
are
almost
indispensable
but
a
camp
so
arranged
ceases
to
be
a
travelling
camp
unless
you
have
men
and
horses
in
your
daily
service
like
a
shah
of
persia
it
may
be
moved
two
or
three
times
in
a
summer
i
have
always
had
a
fancy
for
boats
now
generally
called
catamarans
and
had
two
of
them
on
loch
awe
this
eccentricity
was
perhaps
fortunate
as
my
boats
were
extremely
safe
each
hull
being
decked
from
stem
to
stern
and
divided
internally
into
compartments
they
could
therefore
ship
a
sea
with
perfect
impunity
and
although
often
exposed
to
sudden
and
violent
squalls
we
were
never
in
any
real
danger
one
of
my
catamarans
would
beat
to
windward
tolerably
well
but
she
did
not
tack
quickly
and
occasionally
missed
stays
however
these
defects
were
of
slight
importance
in
a
boat
not
intended
for
racing
and
small
enough
to
be
always
quite
manageable
with
oars
since
those
days
i
have
much
improved
the
construction
of
catamarans
so
that
their
evolutions
are
now
quicker
and
more
certain
they
are
absolutely
the
only
that
combine
lightness
with
safety
and
speed
as
to
the
practice
of
i
very
soon
found
that
the
west
highlands
were
not
favorable
to
painting
from
nature
on
account
of
the
rapid
changes
of
effect
those
changes
are
so
revolutionary
that
they
often
metamorphose
all
the
oppositions
in
a
natural
picture
in
the
course
of
a
single
minute
i
began
by
planting
my
hut
on
the
island
called
inishail
in
the
middle
of
loch
awe
with
the
intention
of
painting
ben
cruachan
from
nature
but
soon
discovered
that
there
were
fifty
cruachans
a
day
each
effacing
its
predecessor
so
my
picture
got
on
badly
if
i
painted
what
was
before
me
the
result
was
like
playing
successfully
a
bar
or
two
from
each
of
several
different
musical
compositions
in
the
vain
hope
of
harmonizing
them
into
one
if
i
tried
to
paint
my
first
impression
it
became
increasingly
difficult
to
do
that
when
the
mountain
itself
presented
novel
and
striking
aspects
every
artist
who
reads
this
will
now
consider
the
above
remarks
no
better
than
a
commonplace
but
in
the
year
english
was
going
through
a
peculiar
phase
there
was
in
some
of
the
younger
artists
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
slight
and
superficial
work
too
often
produced
from
hasty
sketches
and
there
was
an
honest
desire
for
more
substantial
truth
coupled
with
the
hope
of
attaining
it
by
working
directly
from
nature
my
critical
master
ruskin
saw
in
working
from
nature
the
only
hope
for
the
regeneration
of
art
and
my
practical
master
pettitt
considered
it
the
height
of
artistic
virtue
to
sit
down
before
nature
and
work
on
the
details
of
a
large
picture
for
eight
or
ten
weeks
together
i
was
eagerly
anxious
to
do
what
was
considered
most
right
and
quite
willing
to
undergo
any
degree
of
inconvenience
the
truth
is
perhaps
that
like
other
devotees
i
rather
enjoyed
the
sacrifice
of
convenience
for
what
seemed
to
me
at
that
time
the
sacred
cause
of
veracity
in
art
the
highlands
of
scotland
were
intensely
attractive
to
me
as
being
a
kind
of
sublimation
of
the
wild
northern
landscape
that
i
had
already
loved
in
my
native
lancashire
but
the
highlands
were
not
well
chosen
as
a
field
for
in
the
art
of
painting
a
student
ought
not
to
choose
the
most
changeful
of
landscapes
but
the
least
changeful
not
the
highlands
or
the
english
lake
district
but
the
dullest
landscape
he
can
find
in
the
south
or
the
east
of
england
norfolk
would
have
been
a
better
country
for
me
as
a
student
than
argyllshire
if
however
any
prudent
adviser
had
told
me
to
go
to
dull
scenery
in
those
days
it
would
have
been
like
telling
a
passionate
lover
of
great
capitals
to
go
and
live
in
a
narrow
little
provincial
town
i
hated
dull
unromantic
scenery
and
at
the
same
time
had
the
passion
for
mountains
lakes
wild
moorland
and
everything
that
was
rough
and
uncultivated
a
passion
so
predominant
that
it
resembled
rather
the
natural
instinct
of
an
animal
for
its
own
habitat
than
the
choice
of
a
reasonable
being
i
loved
everything
in
the
highlands
even
the
bad
weather
i
delighted
in
clouds
and
storms
and
have
never
experienced
any
natural
influences
more
in
harmony
with
the
inmost
feelings
of
my
own
nature
than
those
of
a
great
lake
dark
waters
when
they
dashed
in
spray
on
the
rocks
of
some
lonely
islet
and
my
boat
flew
past
in
the
gray
and
dreary
gloaming
le
paysage
says
a
french
critic
est
un
√©tat
he
meant
that
we
in
nature
is
that
which
answers
to
the
state
of
our
own
souls
what
is
called
dreary
wild
and
melancholy
scenery
afforded
me
at
that
time
a
kind
of
satisfaction
more
profound
than
that
which
is
given
by
any
of
the
human
arts
i
loved
painting
but
all
the
collections
in
europe
attracted
me
less
than
the
barren
northern
end
of
our
own
island
in
which
there
are
no
pictures
i
loved
architecture
and
chose
a
country
that
is
utterly
destitute
of
it
i
delighted
in
music
and
pitched
my
tent
where
there
was
no
music
but
that
of
the
winds
and
the
waves
the
loch
awe
of
those
days
was
not
the
loch
awe
of
the
present
there
was
no
railway
there
was
not
a
steamer
on
the
lake
either
public
or
private
there
was
no
hotel
by
the
waterside
only
one
or
two
small
inns
imperceptible
in
the
vastness
of
the
almost
uninhabited
landscape
the
lake
was
therefore
almost
a
solitude
and
this
added
to
the
wildness
of
the
climate
and
the
peculiarly
simple
and
temporary
character
of
my
habitation
made
nature
much
more
profoundly
impressive
than
it
ever
is
amidst
the
powerful
rivalry
of
the
works
of
man
the
effect
on
my
mind
was
on
the
whole
saddening
but
not
in
the
least
depressing
it
was
a
kind
of
poetic
sadness
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
low
spirits
i
have
never
been
either
merry
or
melancholy
but
have
kept
an
equable
cheerfulness
that
maintains
itself
serenely
enough
even
in
solitude
and
amidst
the
desolate
aspects
of
stony
and
barren
lands
as
life
advances
it
is
wise
however
to
seek
the
more
cheering
influences
of
the
external
world
and
those
are
rather
to
be
found
in
the
brightest
and
sunniest
landscape
with
abundant
evidence
of
happy
human
habitation
some
southern
land
of
the
vine
where
the
chestnut
grows
high
on
the
hills
and
the
peach
and
the
pear
ripen
richly
in
innumerable
gardens

the
immediate
artistic
results
of
the
expedition
to
the
highlands
were
very
small
i
had
gone
there
to
paint
detailed
work
from
nature
when
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
sketch
and
so
adapt
my
work
to
the
peculiar
character
of
the
climate
the
tendency
then
was
to
detail
and
the
merit
and
value
of
good
sketching
were
not
properly
understood
there
has
been
a
complete
revolution
both
in
public
and
in
artistic
opinion
since
those
days
the
revival
of
etching
which
in
its
liveliest
and
most
spontaneous
form
is
only
sketching
on
copper
the
study
of
sketches
by
the
great
masters
the
publication
of
sketches
by
modern
artists
of
eminence
in
the
artistic
magazines
have
all
led
to
a
far
better
appreciation
of
vitality
in
art
and
consequently
have
tended
to
raise
good
sketching
both
in
popular
and
in

estimation

looked
upon

as
defective
work
excusable
only
on
the
plea
of
want
of
time
to
do
better
the
omissions
in
a

which
when
intelligent
are
merits
seemed
to
me
on
the
contrary
so
many
faults
in
a
word
i
knew
nothing
about
sketching
my
way
was
to
draw
very
carefully

accurately

having
ever
taught
me
anything
about
mass
and
tonic
values
still
less
about
the
difference
between
art
and
nature
and
the
necessity
for
transposing
nature
into
the
keys
of
art
the
consequence
was
a
great
waste
of
time
and
of
only
too
earnest
efforts
with
hardly
anything
to
show
for
them
here
i
leave
this
subject
of
art
for
the
present
as
it
will
be
necessary
to
recur
to
it
later
my
guardian
like
all
women
had
an
objection
to
what
was
not
customary
and
as
my
camp
was
considered
a
piece
of
eccentricity
she
wanted
me
to
take
a
house
on
lochaweside
the
island
called
innistrynich
which
is
near
the
shore
where
the
road
from
inverary
to
dalmally
comes
nearest
to
the
lake
had
a
house
upon
it
that
happened
to
be
untenanted
there
were
twelve
small
rooms
and
the
camping
experience
had
made
me
very
easy
to
please
it
was
possible
to
have
the
whole
island
about
thirty
acres
as
a
home
farm
so
i
took
it
on
a
lease
this
turned
out
a
misfortune
afterwards
as
i
got
tied
to
the
place
not
only
by
the
lease
but
by
a
binding
affection
which
was
extremely
inconvenient
and
led
to
very
unfortunate
consequences
my
dear
guardian
had
another
idea
though
she
had
prudently
avoided
marriage
on
her
own
account
she
thought
it
very
desirable
for
me
and
sometimes
recurred
to
the
subject
her
heart
complaint
made
her
own
life
extremely
precarious
and
she
wished
me
to
have
the
stay
and
anchorage
of
a
second
affection
that
might
make
the
world
less
dreary
for
me
after
she
had
left
it
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
suspected
that
she
looked
to
marriage
as
the
best
chance
of
converting
me
to
her
own
religious
opinions
or
at
least
of
obtaining
outward
conformity
to
confess
the
plain
truth
i
had
a
great
dread
of
marriage
and
not
at
all
from
any
aversion
to
feminine
society
or
from
any
insensibility
to
love
my
two
reasons
were
these
and
all
subsequent
observation
and
experience
have
confirmed
them
for
a
person
given
up
to
intellectual
and
artistic
pursuits
there
is
a
special
value
in
mental
and
pecuniary
independence
so
far
as
i
could
observe
married
men
in
england
they
enjoyed
very
little
mental
independence
being
obliged
on
the
most
important
questions
to
succumb
to
the
opinions
of
their
wives
because
what
is
called
the
opinion
of
society
is
essentially
feminine
opinion
in
our
class
the
ladies
were
all
strong
churchwomen
and
tories
and
the
men
i
most
admired
for
the
combination
of
splendid
talents
with
high
principle
were
to
them
so
far
as
they
knew
anything
about
such
men
objects
of
reprobation
and
abhorrence
no
mother
was
ever
loved
by
a
son
more
devotedly
than
my
guardian
was
by
me
and
yet
her
intolerance
would
have
been
hard
to
bear
in
a
wife
kind
as
she
always
was
in
manner
the
theological
injustice
which
had
been
instilled
into
her
mind
from
infancy
made
her
look
upon
me
as
bad
company
for
my
friends
as
a
heretic
likely
to
contaminate
their
orthodoxy
i
could
bear
that
or
anything
from
her
but
i
determined
that
if
i
married
at
all
it
should
not
be
to
live
under
perpetual
theological
disapprobation
the
other
grave
objection
to
marriage
was
the
dread
of
losing
pecuniary
independence
i
cared
nothing
for
luxury
and
display
having
an
unaffected
preference
for
plain
living
and
being
easily
bored
by
the
elaborate
observances
of
fine
society
so
that
comparative
poverty
had
no
terrors
for
me
on
that
account
but
there
was
another
side
to
the
matter
a
student
clings
to
his
studies
and
dreads
the
interference
that
may
take
him
away
from
them
an
independent
bachelor
can
afford
to
follow
unremunerative
study
a
married
man
unless
he
is
rich
must
lay
out
his
time
to
the
best
pecuniary
advantage
his
hours
are
at
the
disposal
of
the
highest
bidder
there
was
a
young
lady
in
burnley
for
whom
i
had
had
a
boyish
attachment
long
before
and
whom
i
saw
very
frequently
at
her
father
house
in
the
years
preceding
he
was
a
banker
in
very
good
circumstances
and
a
kind
friend
of
mine
as
intimate
perhaps
as
was
possible
considering
the
difference
of
years
he
had
been
a
wrangler
at
cambridge
and
now
employed
his
forcible
and
fully
matured
intellect
freely
on
all
subjects
that
came
in
his
way
without
deference
to
the
popular
opinions
of
the
hour
these
qualities
rare
enough
in
the
upper
middle
class
of
those
days
made
him
very
interesting
to
me
and
i
liked
my
place
in
an
opposite
to
his
when
he
was
in
the
humor
for
talking
he
had
three
handsome
daughters
and
his
eldest
son
had
been
my
and
was
still
occasionally
at
least
one
of
my
companions
their
mother
was
a
remarkably
handsome
and
amiable
lady
so
that
the
house
was
as
pleasant
as
any
house
could
be
we
had
music
and
played
quintets
and
the
eldest
daughter
sometimes
played
a
duet
with
me
she
was
a
good
amateur
musician
well
educated
in
other
ways
and
with
a
great
charm
of
voice
and
manner
under
these
circumstances
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
old
boyish
attachment
revived
on
my
side
though
there
was
nothing
answering
to
it
on
hers
my
good
friend
her
father
sometimes
talked
to
me
about
marriage
and
expressed
the
regret
that
in
a
state
of
civilization
like
ours
and
in
our
class
a
family
of
children
should
be
a
cause
of
weakness
instead
of
strength
in
a
primitive
agricultural
community
sons
are
of
great
value
they
are
an
increase
of
the
family
force
in
a
condition
they
only
weaken
the
father
by
draining
away
his
income
daughters
said
my
friend
are
of
use
in
primitive
societies
and
in
the
english
middle
class
because
they
do
the
work
of
the
house
and
spare
servants
but
our
young
ladies
do
nothing
of
the
least
use
and
require
to
be
first
expensively
educated
and
afterwards
expensively
amused
my
friend
then
went
into
details
about
the
cost
of
his
own
family
which
was
heavy
without
extravagance
or
ostentation
all
this
was
intended
to
warn
me
but
i
asked
if
he
had
any
objection
to
me
personally
as
a
he
answered
with
all
the
kindness
i
expected
that
there
was
no
objection
to
make
he
was
too
intelligent
to
see
anything
criminal
in
my
philosophical
opinions
and
that
in
what
he
had
said
about
the
costliness
of
marriage
he
had
spoken
merely
as
a
friend
thinking
of
the
weight
of
the
burden
i
might
be
taking
upon
myself
and
the
inconvenience
to
my
own
life
in
the
future
one
afternoon
his
daughter
and
i
were
alone
together
playing
a
duet
when
i
asked
her
if
she
would
have
me
and
she
laughingly
declined
i
remember
being
so
little
hurt
by
the
refusal
that
i
said
that
is
not
the
proper
way
to
refuse
an
offer
you
ought
to
express
a
little
regret
you
might
say
at
least
that
you
are
sorry
then
the
young
lady
laughed
again
and
said
very
well
i
will
say
that
i
am
sorry
if
you
wish
it
and
so
we
parted
without
any
further
expression
of
sentiment
on
either
side
i
never
could
understand
why
men
make
themselves
wretched
after
a
refusal
it
only
proves
that
the
young
lady
does
not
care
very
much
for
one
and
it
is
infinitely
better
that
she
should
let
him
know
that
before
marriage
than
after
it
was
soon
quite
clear
to
me
that
in
this
case
the
young
lady
decision
had
been
the
wise
one
we
were
not
really
suited
for
each
other
and
we
should
never
have
been
happy
both
of
us
in
the
same
kind
of
existence
perhaps
she
was
rather
difficult
to
please
or
indifferent
to
marriage
for
she
never
accepted
anybody
and
is
living
still
in
happy
independence
as
an
old
maid
within
a
short
distance
of
hellifield
peel
i
had
a
little
indirect
evidence
thirty
years
afterwards
that
she
had
not
forgotten
me
most
likely
she
will
survive
me
and
read
this
if
she
does
let
the
page
convey
a
complete
acknowledgment
of
her
good
sense
this
was
the
only
offer
of
marriage
i
ever
made
in
england
there
was
a
certain
very
wealthy
heiress
whose
uncle
was
extremely
kind
to
me
and
he
pushed
his
kindness
so
far
as
to
wish
me
to
marry
her
she
was
her
manners
were
quite
equal
to
her
fortune
and
she
had
a
good
appearance
but
the
idea
of
marriage
did
not
occur
to
either
of
us
some
time
afterwards
her
uncle
said
to
a
friend
of
mine
i
can
not
understand
hamerton
i
wanted
him
to
marry
my
niece
and
he
has
gone
and
married
a
french
woman
oh
said
the
other
that
was
only
to
improve
his
french
there
was
another
case
that
i
would
have
passed
in
silence
had
not
people
in
lancashire
persistently
circulated
a
story
of
an
offer
and
a
refusal
a
young
lady
also
a
rich
heiress
though
not
quite
so
rich
as
the
other
had
a
property
a
few
miles
distant
from
mine
she
was
a
very
attractive
girl
very
pretty
and
extremely
intelligent
and
we
were
very
good
friends
to
say
in
this
case
that
the
idea
of
marriage
never
occurred
would
he
untrue
but
when
i
first
knew
her
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
child
and
afterwards
it
became
apparent
to
me
that
to
live
happily
in
her
house
i
should
have
to
stifle
all
my
opinions
on
important
subjects
so
i
never
made
the
offer
that
our
friends
and
perhaps
she
herself
expected
whether
she
would
have
accepted
me
or
not
is
quite
another
question
had
i
made
any
proposal
i
should
have
accompanied
it
by
a
very
plain
statement
of
my
obnoxious
opinions
on
religion
and
politics
and
these
would
almost
certainly
have
produced
a
rupture
after
my
marriage
and
before
hers
we
met
again
in
the
old
friendly
way
i
was
paying
a
call
with
my
wife
in
a
country
house
in
lancashire
when
a
carriage
came
up
the
drive
carriage
and
the
lady
of
the
house
extremely
fluttered
asked
me
if
i
had
no
objection
to
meet
miss
on
the
contrary
i
said
i
like
to
meet
old
friends
the
young
lady
visibly
enjoyed
the
humor
of
the
situation
and
the
embarrassment
of
our
hostess
we
talked
easily
in
the
old
way
and
afterwards
my
wife
and
i
left
on
foot
and
carriage
passed
us
rather
stately
with
servants
in
livery
there
goes
your
most
dangerous
rival
i
said
to
my
wife
and
told
her
what
story
there
was
to
tell
she
is
much
prettier
than
i
am
was
the
modest
answer
and
evidently
a
good
deal
richer
and
she
is
a
charming
person
in
due
time
miss
married
very
suitably
her
husband
is
a
good
churchman
and
conservative
who
takes
a
proper
interest
in
the
pursuits
belonging
to
his
station
my
guardian
was
of
opinion
that
with
my
philosophical
convictions
which
were
at
that
time
not
only
unpopular
but
odious
and
execrated
in
our
own
class
in
england
i
should
have
to
remain
an
old
bachelor
she
herself
would
certainly
never
have
married
an
unbeliever
and
although
her
great
personal
affection
for
me
made
her
glad
to
have
me
in
the
house
she
must
have
felt
that
it
was
like
sheltering
a
pariah
her
sister
once
heard
some
rumor
or
suggestion
connecting
my
name
with
that
of
a
pious
young
lady
and
looked
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
sacrilege
under
these
circumstances
i
came
at
last
to
the
conclusion
that
being
under
a
ban
i
would
at
least
enjoy
my
liberty
either
by
living
my
own
life
as
a
bachelor
or
else
by
marrying
purely
and
simply
according
to
inclination
without
any
reference
to
the
opinion
of
other
people
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
idea
of
a
foreign
marriage
first
occurred
to
me
as
a
possibility
i
had
never
thought
of
it
before
and
if
such
an
idea
had
entered
my
head
the
clear
foresight
of
the
enormous
inconveniences
would
have
immediately
expelled
it
a
foreign
marriage
is
in
fact
quite
an
accumulation
of
inconveniences
one
of
the
two
parties
must
always
be
living
in
a
foreign
country
and
in
all
their
intercourse
together
one
of
the
two
must
always
be
speaking
a
foreign
language
the
families
of
the
two
parties
will
never
know
each
other
or
understand
each
other
properly
there
will
be
either
estrangement
or
misunderstanding
and
unless
there
is
great
largeness
of
mind
in
the
parties
themselves
the
difference
of
national
customs
is
sure
to
produce
quarrels
all
this
was
plain
enough
and
yet
one
morning
when
i
was
writing
on
my
desk
a
tall
oak
desk
that
i
used
to
stand
up
to
the
idea
suddenly
came
as
if
somebody
had
uttered
these
words
in
my
ear
why
should
you
remain
lonely
all
your
days
eug√©nie
gindriez
would
be
an
affectionate
and
faithful
wife
to
you
she
is
not
rich
but
you
would
work
and
fight
your
way
i
pushed
aside
the
sheet
of
manuscript
and
took
a
sheet
of
instead
i
then
wrote
in
french
a
letter
to
a
lady
in
paris
who
knew
the
gindriez
family
and
asked
her
if
mademoiselle
eug√©nie
was
engaged
to
be
married
the
answer
came
that
she
was
well
and
that
there
had
been
no
engagement
soon
afterwards
i
was
in
paris
i
called
on
gindriez
but
his
daughter
was
not
at
home
i
asked
permission
to
call
in
the
evening
and
she
was
out
again
this
was
repeated
two
or
three
times
and
my
wife
told
me
afterwards
that
the
absences
had
not
been
accidental
at
last
we
met
and
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
but
a
certain
gravity
as
if
serious
resolutions
were
impending
her
sister
showed
no
such
reserve
but
greeted
me
gayly
and
frankly
after
a
few
days
i
was
accepted
on
the
condition
of
an
annual
visit
to
france
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
this
engagement
was
what
is
called
in
french
on
my
part
and
hardly
less
so
on
the
part
of
the
young
lady
we
had
however
a
kind
of
inward
assurance
that
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
nationality
and
other
differences
we
were
in
truth
nearer
to
each
other
than
most
people
who
contract
matrimonial
engagements
the
elective
affinities
act
in
spite
of
all
appearances
and
of
many
realities
we
have
often
talked
over
that
time
since
and
have
confessed
that
we
really
knew
hardly
anything
of
each
other
that
our
union
was
but
an
instinctive
choice
however
in
i
had
neither
doubt
nor
anxiety
and

did
not

time
until
long
after
my

she
treated
me
with
the
most
distant
coldness
varied
occasionally
by
a
bitter
innuendo
i
said
nothing
and
bore
all
patiently
looking
forward
to
a
speedy
deliverance

was
much

the
circumstances
to
excuse
my
aunt
who
was
intensely
aristocratic
and
intensely
national
she
was
the
proudest
person
i
ever
knew
and
would
have
considered
any

ours

as

as
the

that
adorned

a

was
not
disposed
to
look
favorably
on
a
roman
catholic
unless
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
old
english
catholic
families
her
ideas
of
the
french
nation
were
those
prevalent
in
england
during
the
wars
against

had
probably
counted
upon
me
to
do
something
to
lift
up

house
and
instead
of
that
i
was
going
to
marry
she
knew
not
whom
it
is
impossible
to
argue
against
national
and
class
prejudices
the
fact
was
simply
that
my
wife
family
belonged
to
the
educated
french
middle
class
her
uncle
was
a
attorney
in
dijon
footnote
very
nearly
in
the
same
social
position
as
my
own
father
his
daughter
afterwards
married
the
grandson
and
representative
of
the
celebrated
count
fran√ßais
de
nantes
who
filled
various
high
offices
in
the
state
and
was
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
peer
of
france
a
fine
portrait
of
him
by
david
is
amongst
their
family
pictures
and
her
father
had
gone
through
a
perfectly
honorable
political
career
both
as
deputy
and
prefect
my
wife
herself
had
been
better
educated
than
most
girls
at
that
time
and
both
spoke
and
wrote
her
own
language
not
only
correctly
but
with
more
than
ordinary
elegance
a
taste
she
inherited
from
her
father
as
to
her
person
she
dressed
simply
but
always
with
irreproachable
neatness
and
a
scrupulous
cleanliness
that
richer
women
might
sometimes
imitate
with
advantage
these
were
the
plain
facts
what
my
aunt
imagined
is
beyond
guessing
before
my
marriage
i
went
to
loch
awe
to
prepare
the
house
on
innistrynich
and
furnish
it
of
all
strange
places
in
the
world
for
a
young
parisienne
to
be
brought
to
surely
innistrynich
was
the
least
suitable
my
way
in
those
days
was
the
usual
human
way
of
thinking
that
what
is
good
for
one
self
is
good
for
everybody
else
did
i
not
know
by
experience
that
the
solitude
of
loch
awe
was
delightful
must
not
my
paradise
be
a
paradise
for
any
daughter
of
eve
it
was
a
charming
bachelor
paradise
the
morning
i
left
for
paris
a
bright
may
morning
the
loch
lying
calm
in
its
great
basin
the
islands
freshly
green
with
the
spring
at
cladich
the
people
who
knew
i
was
going
to
fetch
a
bride
threw
old
shoes
after
the
carriage
for
luck
it
did
not
rain
rice
at
loch
awe
in
those
days
i
was
an
excellent
traveller
then
and
did
not
get
into
a
bed
before
arriving
in
paris
there
was
a
day
in
london
between
two
nights
of
railway
a
day
spent
in
looking
at
pictures
and
making
a
few
purchases
at
paris
i
went
to
a
quiet
hotel
in
the
cit√©
berg√®re
i
was
utterly
alone
no
relation
or
friend
came
with
me
to
my
marriage
somebody
told
me
a
best
man
was
necessary
so
i
asked
a
french
acquaintance
to
be
best
man
and
he
consented
the
morning
of
my
wedding
there
was
a
brushing
the
waxed
oak
floor
on
the
landing
near
my
door
i
had
a
flowered
white
silk
waistcoat
and
the
man
said
monsieur
est
bien
beau
ce
matin
on
dirait
va
√†
une
noce
i
answered
vous
avez
bien
devin√©
en
effet
je
vais
√†
une
noce
it
was
unnecessary
to
give
him
further
information
the
marriage
was
a
curious
little
ceremony
my
wife
father
had
friends
and
acquaintances
in
the
most
various
classes
who
all
came
to
the
wedding
some
men
were
there
who
were
famous
in
the
paris
of
those
days
and
others
whom
i
had
never
heard
of
but
all
were
alike
doomed
to
disappointment
they
expected
a
grand
ceremony
in
the
church
and
instead
of
that
we
got
nothing
but
a
brief
benediction
in
the
vestry
by
reason
of
my
heresy
and
schism
the
benediction
was
over
in
five
minutes
and
we
left
in
the
pouring
rain
whilst
a
crowd
of
people
were
waiting
for
the
ceremony
to
begin
my
wife
like
all
french
girls
would
have
liked
an
imposing
and
important
marriage
and
lo
there
was
nothing
at
all
not
even
an
altar
or
a
censer
or
a
bell
however
we
had
been
legally
married
at
the
with
the
civil
ceremonial
and
as
we
were
certainly
blessed
in
the
vestry
nobody
can
say
that
our
union
was
unhallowed
i
shall
always
remember
that
benediction
for
brief
as
it
was
it
cost
me
a
hundred
francs
footnote
including
what
i
had
to
pay
for
being
called
a
schismatic
by
the
archbishop
of
paris
or
his
officials
a
magnificent
mass
on
my
daughter
marriage
cost
me
only
sixty
which
was
a
very
reasonable
charge
words
can
not
express
how
odious
to
me
are
the
fuss
and
expense
about
a
wedding
there
was
my
a
poor
man
who
thought
it
necessary
indeed
he
was
compelled
by
custom
to
order
a
grand
feast
from
a
famous
restaurant
and
give
a
brilliant
ball
as
if
he
had
been
extremely
happy
to
lose
his
daughter
the
delight
of
his
eyes
and
the
brightness
of
his
home
everything
about
our
wedding
was
peculiarly
awkward
and
uncomfortable
i
knew
none
of
the
guests
i
spoke
their
language
imperfectly
and
was
not
at
ease
then
in
french
society
we
had
to
make
talk
and
try
to
eat
the
family
was
sad
about
our
departure
the
sky
was
gray
the
streets
muddy
and
wet
in
an
interval
of
tolerable
weather
we
went
for
a
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
get
through
the
interminable
afternoon
it
was
pleasanter
when
a
day
or
two
later
my
wife
and
i
were
looking
out
upon
the
sea
from
dieppe
she
had
never
seen
salt
water
before
and
as
it
happened
to
be
a
fine
day
the
vast
expanse
of
the
channel
was
all
a
wonderful
play
of
pale
greens
and
blues
like
turquoise
and
pale
emerald
there
were
white
clouds
floating
in
the
blue
sky
and
here
and
there
a
white
sail
upon
the
sea
my
wife
was
enchanted
with
this
to
her
fresh
young
eyes
revelation
of
a
novel
and
unimaginable
beauty
it
was
a
new
world
for
her
and
that
hour
was
absolutely
the
only
hour
in
her
life
during
which
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
sea
for
she
is
the
worst
of
sailors
and
now
can
not
even
endure
the
smell
of
salt
water
at
a
distance
the
first
thing
we
did
in
london
was
to
go
and
see
the
exhibition
of
the
royal
academy
my
wife
like
her
father
took
a
keen
interest
in
art
and
had
been
rather
well
acquainted
with
french
painting
for
a
girl
of
her
age
when
she
got
into
an
english
exhibition
she
looked
round
in
bewildered
amazement
it
was
for
her
like
being
transported
into
another
planet
in
the
difference
between
french
and
english
painting
was
far
more
striking
than
it
is
french
color
without
being
generally
good
was
subdued
in
fact
most
of
it
was
not
color
at
all
but
only
gray
and
brown
with
a
little
red
or
blue
here
and
there
to
make
people
believe
that
there
was
color
the
english
on
the
other
hand
were
trying
hard
for
real
color
but
the
younger
men
were
in
that
crude
stage
which
is
the
natural
ugly
duckling
condition
of
the
genuine
colorist
the
consequence
was
an
astounding
contrast
between
the
painting
of
the
two
nations
and
to
eyes
educated
in
france
english
art
looked
outrageous
to
a
degree
that
we
realize
with
the
greatest
difficulty
now
at
a
later
period
my
wife
became
initiated
into
the
principles
and
tendencies
of
english
painting
and
then
she
began
to
enjoy
it
i
took
her
to
see
the
turner
collection
in
and
that
seemed
to
her
like
the
ravings
of
a
madman
put
on
canvas
but
a
few
years
later
she
became
a
perfectly
sincere
admirer
of
the
noblest
works
of
turner
i
may
add
that
in
my
wife
was
already
in
spite
of
her
difficulty
in
understanding
what
to
her
were
novelties
far
more
in
sympathy
with
art
generally
than
i
was
myself
she
had
lived
in
a
great
artistic
centre
whilst
i
had
lived
with
nature
in
the
north
and
cared
at
that
time
comparatively
little
about
the
art
of
the
past
my
hopes
being
concentrated
on
a
kind
of
that
was
to
come
in
the
future
and
to
unite
the
effects
i
saw
in
nature
with
a
minute
accuracy
in
the
drawing
of
natural
forms
the
kind
of
painting
i
was
looking
forward
to
was
in
fact
afterwards
realized
by
john
brett
my
wife
first
impressions
of
london
generally
were
scarcely
more
favorable
than
her
impressions
of
english
painting
but
they
were
of
a
very
different
order
if
the
painting
had
appeared
too
bright
the
town
appeared
too
dingy
london
is
extremely
dismal
for
all
french
people
whose
affection
for
their
own
country
leads
them
to
the
very
mistaken
belief
that
the
skies
in
france
are
bright
all
the
year
round
my
wife
now
prefers
london
to
any
place
in
the
world
except
paris
in
fact
she
has
a
strong
affection
for
london
the
consequence
of
the
kindness
she
has
received
there
and
also
of
the
enlightened
interest
she
takes
in
everything
that
is
really
worth
attention
we
went
straight
from
london
to
glasgow
and
thence
to
loch
awe
which
happened
at
that
time
to
be
enveloped
in
a
dense
fog
that
lasted
two
days
so
that
when
i
told
my
wife
that
there
was
a
high
mountain
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
she
could
hardly
believe
it
in
fact
nothing
was
visible
but
a
still
gray
shoreless
sea
i
was
now
as
it
seemed
in
a
condition
of
great
felicity
being
in
the
place
i
loved
best
on
earth
with
the
person
most
dear
to
me
unfortunately
the
union
of
many
different
circumstances
and
conditions
is
necessary
to
perfect
happiness
if
happiness
exists
in
the
world
the
element
lacking
in
my
case
was
success
in
work
or
at
least
the
inward
assurance
of
progress
there
was
our
beautiful
island
home
in
itself
as
much
a
poem
as
a
canto
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
with
its
ancient
oaks
its
rocky
shore
its
green
undulating
pasture
there
was
the
lake
for
sailing
and
the
mountain
for
climbing
and
all
around
us
a
country
of
unlimited
wealth
of
material
for
the
sketcher
amidst
all
this
with
a
too
earnest
and
painful
application
i
set
myself
to
do
what
had
never
been
done
to
unite
the
color
and
effect
of
nature
to
the
material
accuracy
of
the
photograph
memoir
of
philip
gilbert
hamerton
chapter
i
my
first
sight
of
loch
arrival
at
our
domestic
difficulties
about
a
kitchen
garden
when
philip
gilbert
hamerton
asked
me
to
marry
him
he
conscientiously
attempted
to
explain
how
different
my
life
would
be
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
from
that
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
in
paris
he
said
how
solitary
it
was
especially
in
the
how
entirely
devoid
of
what
are
called
the
pleasures
of
a
metropolis
to
which
a
parisian
lady
has
the
reputation
of
being
such
a
slave
he
knew
however
that
it
was
not
my
case
and
already
his
devotion
to
study
was
such
that
he
requested
me
to
promise
not
to
interfere
with
his
work
of
any
kind
that
he
deemed
necessary
were
it
camping
out
or
sailing
in
stormy
weather
to
observe
nature
under
all
her
changing
aspects
either
of
day
or
night
still
the
picture
he
drew
of
our
future
existence
was
by
no
means
all
in
dark
colors
for
with
the
enthusiasm
of
an
artist
he
described
the
glories
of
the
highlands
the
skies
the
effects
of
light
and
shadow
on
the
mountains
the
beauties
of
the
lovely
isles
and
the
charm
of
sailing
on
the
moonlit
and
mysterious
lake
he
also
made
me
acquainted
with
the
numerous
legends
of
loch
awe
he
had
told
them
in
verse
but
i
was
ignorant
of
english
which
would
lend
a
romantic
atmosphere
to
our
he
was
so
sensitive
to
the
different
moods
of
nature
that
his
descriptions
gave
to
a
girl
like
me
an
intense
desire
to
witness
them
with
my
own
eyes
and
when
i
did
see
them
there
was
no
and
the
effect
was
so
overpowering
that
it
seemed
like
the
revelation
of
a
new
sense
in
me
the
first
glimpse
i
had
of
loch
awe
from
the
top
of
the
coach
was
like
the
realization
of
a
fantastic
and
splendid
dream
i
could
not
believe
it
to
be
a
reality
and
thought
of
some
mirage
but
my
husband
was
delighted
by
this
first
impression
we
reached
innistrynich
shortly
before
nightfall
and
i
was
taken
to
the
keeper
cottage
to
warm
myself
whilst
the
luggage
was
being
conveyed
across
the
bay
to
the
house
though
it
was
the
end
of
may
the
weather
had
been
so
cold
all
the
way
that
i
felt
almost
benumbed
after
the
drive
for
being
accustomed
to
the
climate
of
france
i
had
taken
but
scanty
precautions
in
the
way
of
wraps
believing
them
to
be
superfluous
at
that
time
of
the
year
my
husband
having
begged
the
keeper
wife
to
take
care
of
me
she
carried
her
assiduities
to
a
point
that
quite
confused
me
for
i
could
not
remonstrate
in
words
and
she
was
so
evidently
prompted
by
kindness
that
i
was
fearful
of
hurting
her
by
opposing
her
but
exaggerated
attentions
she
swathed
me
in
a
scotch
plaid
and
placed
the
bundle
i
had
become
in
a
cushioned
and
canopied
by
the
the
smoke
and
unaccustomed
odor
of
which
stifled
me
then
she
insisted
upon
removing
my
boots
and
stockings
and
chafed
my
feet
in
her
hands
to
bring
back
a
little
warmth
lastly
she
hospitably
brought
me
what
she
thought
the
best
thing
she
had
to
offer
a
hot
whiskey
toddy
to
please
her
and
also
to
relieve
my
numbness
i
tried
my
best
to
drink
what
seemed
to
me
a
horrid
mixture
but
i
could
not
manage
it
and
could
not
explain
why
and
the
poor
woman
remained
lost
in
sorrowful
bewilderment
at
my
rejection
of
the
steaming
tumbler
just
then
my
husband
came
back
and
after
thanking
the
keeper
wife
rowed
me
over
to
innistrynich
it
was
then
quite
dark
and
impossible
to
see
the
island
even
the
outside
of
the
cottage
but
when
the
door
was
open
it
showed
the
prettiest
picture
imaginable
the
entrance
was
brilliantly
illuminated
and
our
two
servants
a
maid
and
a
young
lad
thursday
of
the
painter
camp
both
healthy
and
were
standing
ready
to
relieve
us
of
our
wraps
the
had
an
inviting
glow
of
comfort
with
the
generous
fire
the
lights
of
the
elegant
candelabra
playing
amongst
the
carvings
of
the
oak
furniture
and
the
tones
of
the
dark
ruddy
curtains
harmonizing
with
the
lighter
ones
of
the
carpet
an
artistic
silver
set
of
which
my
husband
had
secretly
brought
from
paris
with
the
candelabra
had
been
spread
on
the
table
ready
for
us
and
my
appreciation
of
the
taste
and
thoughtfulness
displayed
on
my
behalf
gladdened
and
touched
the
donor
i
had
never
before
partaken
of
tea
as
a
meal
but
it
was
certainly
a
most
delightful
repast
to
both
of
us
after
a
short
rest
my
husband
showed
me
the
arrangements
of
the
house
rich
in
surprises
to
my
foreign
notions
but
none
the
less
interesting
and
pleasant
our
was
to
serve
as
also
for
the
orthodox
had
been
transformed
into
a
studio
and
they
stood
opposite
to
each
other
a
little
further
along
the
corridor
came
the
two
best
bedrooms
which
at
first
sight
gave
to
a
parisian
girl
a
sensation
of
bareness
and
emptiness
corrected
later
by
habit
everything
necessary
was
to
be
found
there
large
brass
bedsteads
with
snowy
coverings
all
the
modern
contrivances
for
the
toilet
chests
of
drawers
each
surmounted
by
a
bright
even
a
number
of
tiny
and
curious
gimcracks
ornamented
the
narrow
mantelpiece
but
to
a
french
eye
the
absence
of
curtains
to
the
bed
and
the
unconcealed
display
of
washing
utensils
suggested
a
de
rather
than
a
bedroom
this
simplicity
has
now
become
quite
fashionable
among
wealthy
french
people
on
account
of
its
healthiness
the
fresh
air
playing
more
freely
and
remaining
purer
than
in
rooms
crowded
with
stuffed
seats
and
darkened
by
elaborate
upholstery
on
the
upper
story
were
four
other
rooms
used
as
laboratory
and
servants
rooms
whilst
on
the
we
had
a
scullery
a
large
kitchen
a
laundry
that
i
used
afterwards
as
a
private
kitchen
when
my
husband
provided
it
with
a
set
of
french
brass
pans
and
a
charcoal
range
a
spare
room
which
was
turned
into
a
nursery
by
and
by
and
lastly
a
repository
for
my
husband
not
inconsiderable
paraphernalia
the
first
days
after
our
arrival
were
devoted
to
sailing
or
rowing
on
the
lake
to
acquaint
me
with
its
topography
soon
however
we
made
rules
to
lose
no
time
for
we
had
both
plenty
of
work
before
us
my
husband
at
that
time
knew
french
pretty
well
he
could
express
everything
he
wished
to
say
and
understood
even
the
of
the
language
but
his
accent
betrayed
him
at
once
as
an
englishman
and
there
lingered
in
his
speech
a
certain
hesitation
about
the
choice
of
words
most
appropriate
to
his
meaning
as
for
me
my
english
had
remained
that
of
a
and
my
husband
offered
me
his
congratulations
on
my
extremely
limited
knowledge
for
this
reason
that
i
should
have
little
to
unlearn
we
agreed
to
begin
with
that
one
of
us
ought
to
know
the
other
language
thoroughly
so
as
to
establish
a
perfect
understanding
and
as
he
was
so
much
more
advanced
in
french
than
i
in
english
it
was
decided
that
for
a
time
he
should
become
my
pupil
and
that
our
conversations
should
be
in
my
on
my
part
i
devoted
two
hours
a
day
to
the
study
of
english
grammar
and
to
the
writing
of
exercises
themes
and
versions
this
task
was
fulfilled
during
my
husband
absence
or
whilst
he
was
engaged
with
his
correspondence
and
in
the
afternoon
i
used
to
read
english
aloud
to
him
while
he
drew
or
painted
either
at
home
or
out
of
doors
it
was
his
own
scheme
of
tuition
and
proved
most
satisfactory
but
required
in
the
teacher
particularly
at
the
beginning
an
attention
to
correct
the
pronunciation
of
almost
every
word
and
to
give
the
translation
of
it
together
with
a
great
store
of
patience
to
bear
with
the
constantly
recurring
errors
for
not
to
mar
my
interest
in
the
works
he
gave
me
to
read
i
was
exempted
from
the
slow
process
of
the
dictionary
he
was
himself
the
best
of
dictionaries
explaining
the
differences
of
meaning
giving
the
life
and
spirit
of
each
term
and
always
impressing
this
truth
that
rarely
does
the
same
expression
convey
exactly
the
same
idea
in
two
languages
he
frequently
failed
to
give
word
for
word
because
he
would
not
give
an
approximate
translation
but
he
was
always
ready
with
a
detailed
explanation
and
so
taught
me
to
enter
into
the
peculiar
genius
of
the
language
so
that
if
i
did
not
become
a
good
translator
i
learned
early
to
think
and
to
feel
in
sympathy
with
the
authors
i
was
studying
if
the
weather
allowed
it
gilbert
generally
took
me
out
on
the
lake
and
according
to
the
prevailing
wind
chose
some
particular
spot
for
a
study
these
excursions
lasted
about
half
the
day
or
more
and
then
some
sort
of
nourishment
was
required
but
as
my
ignorance
of
the
language
prevented
me
from
giving
the
necessary
orders
the
responsibility
of
the
commissariat
entirely
devolved
upon
him
and
i
may
candidly
avow
that
the
results
were
a
continual
source
of
surprise
to
me
being
unacquainted
with
english
ways
i
presumed
that
it
was
customary
to
live
in
the
frugal
and
uniform
fashion
prevalent
at
innistrynich
namely
at
breakfast
ham
or
bacon
sometimes
eggs
with
or
without
butter
according
to
circumstances
toast
or
scones
if
bread
were
wanting
and
coffee
at
lunch
dry
biscuits
and
milk
at
which
varied
considerably
to
ranging
from
five
if
we
were
in
the
house
to
eight
or
nine
if
my
husband
was
out
sketching
ham
and
eggs
again
or
a
little
mutton
chop
or
steak
if
the
meat
were
fresh
cold
boiled
shoulder
or
leg
if
it
was
salted
and
a
primitive
sort
of
crisp
hard
cake
which
thursday
always
served
with
evident
pleasure
and
pride
being
first
and
then
partaker
of
the
luxury
i
often
wondered
how
englishmen
could
grow
so
tall
and
so
strong
on
such
food
for
i
was
aware
within
myself
of
certain
feelings
of
weakness
and
sickness
never
experienced
before
but
which
i
was
ashamed
to
confess
so
long
as
men
whose
physical
organizations
required
more
sustenance
remained
free
from
them
one
day
however
the
reason
of
this
difference
became
clear
to
me
my
husband
had
proposed
to
show
me
kilchurn
castle
which
he
was
going
to
sketch
and
we
started
early
after
the
first
light
breakfast
with
thursday
to
manage
the
sails
on
turning
round
innistrynich
we
met
a
contrary
wind
and
had
to
beat
against
it
it
was
slow
work
and
at
last
i
timidly
suggested
that
it
might
perhaps
be
better
to
turn
back
to
get
something
to
eat
but
gilbert
triumphantly
said
he
was
prepared
for
the
emergency
and
had
provided
a
box
of
figs
yes
and
he
opened
it
deliberately
and
offered
me
the
first
pick
i
could
not
refrain
from
looking
at
thursday
whose
face
betrayed
such
a
queer
expression
of
mingled
amusement
and
disappointed
expectation
that
i
burst
out
laughing
heartily
at
which
my
husband
who
had
been
meditatively
eating
fig
after
fig
looked
up
wondering
what
was
the
matter
i
then
asked
if
that
was
all
our
meal
and
he
gravely
took
out
of
the
box
two
bottles
of
beer
and
a
flask
of
sherry
the
look
of
which
seemed
to
revive
thursday
spirits
wonderfully
as
for
me
who
drank
at
that
time
neither
beer
nor
wine
and
whose
taste
for
dry
figs
was
very
limited
i
hinted
that
something
more
bread
for
instance
would
not
have
been
superfluous
the
opportunity
for
ridding
himself
of
cares
so
little
in
harmony
with
his
tastes
and
artistic
pursuits
was
not
lost
by
my
husband
and
i
was
then
and
there
invested
with
the
powers
and
functions
of
housekeeper
this
was
the
plan
adopted
for
the
discharge
of
my
new
duties
in
the
morning
i
studiously
wrote
as
an
exercise
the
orders
i
wished
to
give
and
after
correction
i
learned
to
repeat
them
by
word
of
mouth
till
i
could
be
understood
by
the
servants
it
succeeded
tolerably
when
my
husband
was
accessible
if
an
explanation
was
rendered
necessary
on
account
of
my
foreign
accent
but
there
was
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
if
he
happened
to
be
absent
ever
since
i
knew
him
i
had
noticed
his
anxiety
to
lose
no
time
and
to
turn
every
minute
to
the
best
account
for
his
improvement
throughout
his
life
he
made
rules
to
bind
his
dreamy
fancy
to
active
study
and
production
they
were
frequently
altered
according
to
the
state
of
his
health
and
the
nature
of
his
work
at
the
time
but
he
felt
the
necessity
of
laws
to
govern
and
regulate
his
strong
inclination
towards
reflection
and
reading
he
used
to
say
that
when
people
allowed
themselves
unmeasured
time
for
what
they
called
thinking
it
was
generally
an
excuse
for
idle
dreaming
because
the
brain
after
a
certain
time
given
to
active
exertion
felt
exhausted
and
could
no
longer
be
prompted
to
work
with
intellectual
profit
that
in
consequence
the
effort
grew
weaker
and
weaker
till
vague
musings
and
indistinct
shadows
gradually
replaced
the
powerful
grasp
and
clear
vision
of
healthy
mental
labor
on
the
other
side
it
must
be
said
that
he
was
too
much
of
a
poet
to
undervalue
the
state
of
apparent
indolence
which
is
so
favorable
to
inspiration
and
that
he
often
quoted
in
the
words
of
claude
tillier
le
temps
le
mieux
employ√©
est
celui
que
perd
aware
of
his
strong
propensity
to
that
particular
mental
state
he
attempted
all
his
life
to
restrict
it
within
limits
which
would
leave
sufficient
time
for
active
pursuits
his
love
of
sailing
must
have
been
closely
connected
with
the
inclination
to
a
restful
peaceful
dreamy
state
for
although
fond
of
all
kinds
of
boating
he
greatly
preferred
a
to
any
other
and
never
wished
to
possess
a
steamer
or
cared
much
to
make
use
of
one
still
he
took
great
pleasure
in
some
forms
of
physical
exercise
he
could
use
an
oar
beautifully
he
was
a
capital
horseman
having
been
used
to
ride
from
the
age
of
six
and
retained
a
firm
seat
to
the
last
he
readily
undertook
pedestrian
excursions
and
the
ascent
of
mountains
he
often
rode
from
innistrynich
to
inverary
or
dalmally
when
our
island
became
a
peninsula
in
dry
weather
or
in
winter
when
the
bay
was
frozen
over
but
he
found
little
satisfaction
in
riding
the
mare
we
had
then
which
was
mainly
used
as
a
to
fetch
provisions
for
the
necessaries
of
life
were
not
very
accessible
about
us
we
had
to
get
bread
meat
and
common
grocery
from
inverary
and
the
rest
from
glasgow
so
that
we
soon
discovered
that
the
whole
time
of
a
male
servant
would
be
required
for
errands
of
different
kinds
not
unfrequently
was
the
half
of
a
day
lost
in
the
attempt
to
get
a
dozen
eggs
from
the
little
scattered
farms
or
a
skinny
fowl
or
such
a
rare
delicacy
as
a
cabbage
sometimes
thursday
came
back
from
the
town
peevish
and
angry
at
his
lost
labor
having
found
the
bread
too
hard
or
too
musty
and
mutton
unprocurable
as
to
the
beef
which
came
occasionally
from
glasgow
it
was
usually
tainted
except
in
and
veal
was
not
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
except
in
a
condition
to
make
one
fearful
of
a
catastrophe
there
was
also
the
additional
trouble
of
unloading
the
goods
on
the
side
of
the
road
of
putting
them
into
the
boat
to
be
rowed
across
the
bay
then
they
must
be
carried
to
the
house
either
by
man
or
horse
merely
to
get
the
indispensable
quantity
of
fuel
in
such
a
damp
climate
when
fires
have
to
be
kept
up
for
eight
or
oftener
nine
months
in
the
year
was
a
serious
matter
and
my
husband
complained
that
he
was
constantly
deprived
of
thursday
services
he
then
decided
to
take
as
a
gardener
workman
and
occasional
boatman
a
highlander
of
the
name
of
dugald
whom
he
had
employed
sometimes
in
the
latter
capacity
for
he
knew
something
of
boats
having
been
formerly
a
fisherman
there
were
some
outbuildings
on
the
island
one
of
them
contained
two
rooms
which
dugald
and
his
wife
found
sufficient
for
them
they
had
no
children
and
this
became
the
gardener
cottage
another
was
used
as
a
stable
and
the
smallest
as
a
and
carpenter
shop
for
now
we
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
could
not
possibly
live
all
the
year
round
on
the
island
without
a
small
farm
to
provide
us
at
least
with
milk
cream
butter
and
eggs
so
we
bought
two
cows
and
also
a
small
flock
of
sheep
that
we
might
always
be
sure
of
mutton
either
fresh
or
salted
this
did
not
afford
a
great
variety
of
but
it
was
better
than
starvation
vegetables
other
than
potatoes
and
an
occasional
cabbage
being
unseen
and
i
believe
unknown
at
loch
awe
and
my
husband
health
having
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
privation
we
had
the
ambition
of
growing
our
own
vegetables
and
a
great
variety
of
them
too
dugald
was
set
to
dig
and
manure
a
large
plot
of
ground
though
he
kept
mumbling
that
it
was
utterly
useless
as
nothing
could
or
would
grow
where
oats
did
not
ripen
once
in
three
years
and
that
highlanders
who
knew
so
much
better
than
foreigners
would
not
be
fashed
to
attempt
it
however
as
he
was
paid
to
do
the
work
he
had
to
do
it
and
it
was
simple
enough
for
he
had
no
pretensions
to
being
a
gardener
the
choice
of
seeds
and
the
sowing
of
them
were
left
to
gilbert
who
had
never
given
a
thought
to
it
before
and
to
me
who
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
subject
in
this
emergency
we
got
books
to
guide
us
bought
and
sowed
an
enormous
quantity
of
seeds
and
to
our
immense
gratification
some
actually
sprouted
our
pride
was
great
when
the
doctor
came
to
lunch
with
us
for
the
first
time
and
we
could
offer
him
radishes
and
lettuce
which
he
duly
wondered
at
and
appreciated
of
course
we
had
to
put
up
with
many
failures
but
still
it
was
worth
while
to
persevere
as
in
addition
to
carrots
onions
turnips
which
grew
to
perfection
potatoes
and
cabbages
we
had
salads
of
different
kinds
small
pumpkins
and
fine
cauliflowers
i
soon
discovered
that
peat
was
extremely
favorable
to
them
so
we
had
a
trench
made
in
peaty
soil
where
they
grew
splendidly
although
very
well
satisfied
on
the
whole
with
our
attempt
we
thought
it
absorbed
too
much
of
my
husband
time
and
he
soon
requested
me
to
go
on
with
it
by
myself
and
frankly
avowed
that
he
could
not
take
any
interest
in
gardening
even
in
ornamental
gardening
this
lack
of
interest
seemed
strange
to
me
because
he
liked
to
study
nature
in
all
her
phenomena
but
it
lasted
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
a
garden
but
he
liked
flowers
for
their
colors
and
perfumes
not
individually
and
trees
for
their
forms
either
noble
or
graceful
and
especially
for
their
shade
he
could
not
bear
to
see
them
pruned
and
when
it
became
imperative
to
cut
some
of
their
branches
he
used
to
complain
quite
sadly
to
his
daughter
who
shared
his
feelings
about
trees
and
he
would
say
now
mary
you
see
they
are
at
it
again
spoiling
our
poor
trees
and
if
i
replied
but
it
is
for
their
health
the
branches
were
trailing
on
the
ground
and
now
the
trees
will
grow
taller
he
slowly
shook
his
head
unconvinced
when
we
took
the
small
house
at
he
was
delighted
by
the
wildness
of
the
tiny
park
sloping
gently
down
to
the
cool
narrow
shaded
river
over
which
the
bending
trees
met
and
arched
and
he
begged
me
not
to
interfere
with
the
trailing
blackberry
branches
which
crept
about
the
roots
and
stems
of
the
superb
trees
making
sweet
but
impenetrable
thickets
interwoven
with
honeysuckle
even
in
the
midst
of
the
alleys
and
lawns
and
now
to
return
to
the
domestic
arrangements
arrived
at
by
mutual
consent
upon
me
devolved
the
housekeeping
provisioning
and
care
of
the
garden
with
the
help
of
a
maid
occasionally
that
of
dugald
wife
as
charwoman
and
pretty
regularly
that
of
dugald
himself
for
a
certain
portion
of
the
day
that
is
when
he
was
not
required
by
my
husband
to
man
the
boat
or
to
help
in
a
expedition
it
was
agreed
that
thursday
should
be
considered
as
his

chapter
ii
money
difficulties
about
expensiveness
of
our
mode
of
life
my
husband
had
a
little
fortune
sufficient
for
his
wants
as
a
bachelor
which
were
modest
it
would
have
been
larger
had
his
father
nursed
it
instead
of
diminishing
it
as
he
did
by
his
reckless
ways
and
especially
by
entrusting
its
management
during
his
son
minority
to
a
very
kind
but
incapable
guardian
in
business
matters
and
to
another
competent
but
dishonest
trustee
who
squandered
unchecked
many
important
sums
of
money
and
made
agreements
and
leases
profitable
to
himself
but
almost
ruinous
to
his
ward
as
to
the
other
trustee
he
never
troubled
himself
so
far
as
to
read
a
deed
or
a
document
before
signing
it
still
what
remained
when
my
husband
came
of
age
was
amply
sufficient
for
the
kind
of
life
he
soon
chose
that
of
an
artist
and
he
hoped
moreover
to
increase
it
by
the
sale
of
his
works
he
was
however
aware
of
the
future
risks
of
the
situation
when
he
asked
in
marriage
a
girl
without
fortune
and
he
told
me
without
reserve
what
we
had
to
expect
an
important
portion
of
his
income
was
to
cease
after
fourteen
years
the
end
of
the
lease
of
a
but
he
felt
certain
that
he
would
be
able
by
that
time
to
replace
it
by
his
own
earnings
and
meanwhile
we
were
to
live
so
economically
and
so
simply
that
as
we
thought
there
was
no
need
for
anxiety
so
we
convinced
my
parents
with
the
persuasion
that
love
lent
us
that
after
all
we
should
not
be
badly
off
soon
after
the
completion
of
our
household
organization
however
i
began
to
fear
that
a
very
simple
way
of
living
might
under
peculiar
conditions
become
expensive
a
breakfast
consisting
of
ham
and
eggs
is
not
extravagantly
luxurious
but
if
the
ham
comes
to
thrice
the
original
price
when
carriage
and
spoilage
are
allowed
for
and
if
to
the
sixpence
paid
for
eggs
you
add
the
wages
of
a
man
for
as
many
hours
you
find
to
your
dismay
that
though
your
repast
was
simple
it
was
not
particularly
cheap
whichever
way
we
turned
we
met
with
unavoidable
and
expenses
perhaps
an
english
lady
accustomed
to
the
possibilities
of
such
a
place
and
to
the
habits
of
the
servants
and
the
customs
of
the
country
might
have
managed
better
though
even
i
do
see
clearly
what
she
could
have
done
as
for
me
though
i
had
been
brought
up
in
the
belief
that
paris
was
one
of
the
most
expensive
places
to
live
in
and
though
i
was
perfectly
aware
of
its
prices
having
kept
my
father
house
for
some
years
on
account
of
my
mother
weak
state
of
health
i
was
entirely
taken
by
surprise
and
rather
afraid
of
the
reckoning
at
the
end
of
the
year
no
one
who
has
not
attempted
that
kind
of
primitive
existence
has
any
idea
of
its
complications
a
mere
change
of
servant
was
expensive
and
such
changes
were
rather
frequent
on
account
of
their
disgust
at
the
breach
of
orthodox
habits
and
the
lack
of
followers
or
their
dismissal
was
rendered
inevitable
by
their
incapacity
or
unwillingness
or
their
contempt
for
everything
out
of
their
own
country
we
had
a
capital
instance
of
this
characteristic
in
a
nurse
who
came
from
greenock
and
who
thoroughly
despised
everything
in
the
highlands
one
night
my
husband
and
myself
were
out
of
doors
admiring
a
splendid
full
moon
by
the
light
of
which
it
was
quite
easy
to
read
the
nurse
katharine
was
standing
by
us
holding
baby
in
her
arms
and
she
heard
me
express
my
admiration
unable
to
put
up
with
praises
of
a
highland
moon
she
exclaimed
deliberately
sure
then
you
should
see
the
greenock
moon
this
is
nothing
to
it
this
change
of
servants
was
of
serious
moment
to
us
both
in
the
way
of
time
and
money
for
we
had
to
go
to
glasgow
or
greenock
to
fetch
new
ones
besides
paying
for
their
journeys
to
and
fro
and
a
month
wages
if
they
did
not
give
satisfaction
which
was
but
too
often
the
case
once
it
happened
that
a
steamer
bringing
over
a
small
cargo
of
provisions
foundered
and
we
were
in
consequence
nearly
reduced
to
a
state
of
starvation
also
after
paying
princely
prices
for
laying
hens
we
only
found
empty
shells
in
the
the
rats
having
sucked
the
eggs
before
us
gilbert
to
save
our
eggs
bought
a
vivacious
little
terrier
who
killed
more
fowls
than
rats
and
as
to
the
few
little
chickens
that
were
hatched
despite
the
cold
and
damp
they
gradually
disappeared
devoured
by
the
birds
of
prey
falcons
and
eagles
which
carried
them
off
under
my
eyes
even
whilst
i
was
feeding
them
another
very
important
item
of
expense
lay
in
the
different
materials
required
for
my
husband
work
of
various
kinds
and
of
which
he
ordered
such
quantities
that
their
remnants
are
still
to
be
found
in
his
laboratory
as
i
write
papers
of
all
sorts
of
quality
and
size
for
crayons
pastel
etching
tracing
colors
dry
and
moist
brushes
canvases
frames
boards
panels
also
the
requisites
for
photography
it
was
one
of
my
husband
lasting
peculiarities
that
in
his
desire
to
do
a
great
quantity
of
work
and
in
the
fear
of
running
short
of
something
he
always
gave
orders
far
exceeding
what
he
could
possibly
use
he
also
invariably
allowed
himself
for
the
completion
of
any
given
work
an
insufficiency
of
time
because
he
did
not
beforehand
take
into
account
the
numerous
corrections
that
he
was
sure
to
make
for
he
was
constantly
trying
to
do
better
our
journeys
also
contributed
to
swell
considerably
the
total
of
our
expenditure
before
we
were
married
he
promised
my
parents
that
he
would
bring
me
over
once
a
year
for
about
a
month
for
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
on
their
part
to
let
their
eldest
child
go
so
far
away
and
even
as
it
was
to
remain
separated
for
so
long
at
a
time
my
relations
had
also
to
be
considered
and
he
decided
that
every
time
we
went
to
france
we
would
stay
a
week
at
least
with
his
maiden
aunts
who
had
brought
him
up
and
a
few
days
with
the
family
of
his
kind
uncle
thomas
hamerton
of
todmorden
then
a
short
time
in
london
to
see
the
exhibitions
and
his
friends
the
same
itinerary
was
to
be
followed
on
our
return
my
parents
living
then
in
paris
where
even
at
that
time
rents
were
high
and
space
restricted
my
husband
dislike
to
confinement
did
not
allow
him
to
remain
satisfied
with
the
single
room
they
could
put
at
our
disposal
moreover
in
order
to
work
effectively
peace
and
perfect
quiet
were
absolutely
indispensable
to
him
so
he
took
lodgings
close
to
my
parents
and
whilst
i
spent
as
much
of
my
time
with
them
as
i
could
spare
he
wrote
or
read
in
the
noiseless
rooms
we
had
taken
cour
et
of
course
the
rent
of
the
lodgings
was
an
additional
expense
altogether
when
we
summed
up
the
accounts
after
the
first
year
we
were
dismayed
to
see
what
was
the
cost
of
such
an
unpretentious
existence
but
with
youthful
hope
we
counted
upon
the
income
that
art
could
not
fail
to
bring
shortly
chapter
iii
painting
from
project
of
an
plan
of
the
painter
camp
topographic
charm
of
our
life
in
the
highlands
hamerton
has
himself
explained
in
his
autobiography
what
were
his
artistic
tendencies
and
aims
he
meant
to
be
topographically
true
in
his
rendering
of
nature
and
was
unluckily
greatly
influenced
by
the
who
were
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
attracting
great
attention
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
that
kind
of
art
and
the
most
famous
specimens
of
it
which
my
husband
took
me
to
see
in
london
only
awoke
an
apprehension
as
to
what
i
might
think
of
his
own
pictures
when
they
were
shown
to
me
the
old
masters
in
the
louvre
even
the
yearly
salons
where
under
my
father
guidance
i
had
learned
to
admire
troyon
corot
and
millet
had
given
me
an
education
which
fell
short
of
enabling
me
to
recognize
the
merits
of
the
new
school
it
was
in
vain
that
my
husband
pointed
out
the
veracity
of
the
minutest
detail
in
vain
that
he
attempted
to
interest
me
in
the
subjects
or
praised
the
scheme
of
color
i
did
not
understand
it
as
art
and
i
received
an
impression
perfectly
remembered
to
this
day
and
which
i
hardly
hope
to
convey
to
others
in
words
it
was
for
my
eyes
what
unripe
fruit
is
for
the
teeth
it
was
a
long
time
before
my
husband
completed
a
picture
at
innistrynich
because
he
had
resolved
at
first
to
paint
only
from
nature
and
was
constantly
interrupted
by
changes
of
effect
after
many
attempts
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
only
paint
local
color
and
in
order
to
study
effects
rapidly
he
made
hasty
sketches
with
copious
notes
written
in
pencil
still
he
was
not
satisfied
the
sketch
however
quickly
traced
retarding
the
taking
of
notes
so
that
the
effect
had
vanished
before
they
were
completed
after
giving
mature
consideration
to
another
scheme
of
study
he
decided
to
make
careful
topographical
drawings
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
scenery
such
as
ben
cruachan
glen
etive
ben
vorlich
glencoe
and
to
have
them
reproduced
in
large
quantities
so
that
when
upon
the
scene
represented
by
any
of
them
he
would
only
have
to
note
the
most
impressive
effects
the
sketch
having
become
unnecessary
i
wished
him
to
take
these
memoranda
in
or
pastels
for
it
seemed
to
me
very
difficult
when
the
effect
was
out
of
the
memory
to
revive
it
in
its
entirety
by
hundreds
of
minute
observations
covering
the
whole
sheet
of
paper
i
had
another
reason
for
wishing
to
see
him
work
more
in
colors
it
was
his
want
of
dexterity
with
them
which
i
thought
practice
only
could
give
but
he
said
it
was
too
slow
for
study
and
should
be
reserved
for
and
bad
weather
another
point
upon
which
we
could
not
agree
was
the
amount
of
truth
to
which
an
artist
ought
to
bind
himself
he
said
nothing
less
than
topographic
truth
and
he
took
infinite
pains
in
the
measurement
of
mountain
peaks
breadth
of
and
length
of
running
streams
to
his
grievous
disappointment
when
the
conscientious
and
labored
study
was
shown
to
me
i
could
not
but
repeat
that
if
it
were
true
it
did
not
look
so
to
me
since
it
produced
none
of
the
sensations
of
the
natural
scene
you
would
like
me
to
exaggerate
then
he
asked
yes
i
answered
if
that
is
the
way
to
make
it
true
but
he
persevered
in
his
system
he
used
to
camp
out
a
week
sometimes
a
fortnight
wherever
he
made
choice
of
a
subject
and
returned
to
the
same
spot
several
times
afterwards
with
his
printed
studies
of
outlines
to
take
notes
of
effects
he
was
fond
of
elaborating
schemes
and
i
told
him
sometimes
that
i
wished
he
would
allow
things
to
go
on
more
simply
that
he
would
paint
his
pictures
straightforwardly
and
try
for
their
reception
in
the
academy
but
he
answered
that
most
certainly
they
would
be
rejected
if
painted
with
so
little
care
and
that
he
thought
the
best
plan
was
to
go
on
patiently
during
the
summer
as
he
had
begun
then
to
paint
in
winter
from
his
studies
and
produce
not
an
odd
picture
now
and
then
but
a
series
of
pictures
illustrating
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
of
highland
scenery
which
he
would
put
before
the
public
in
a
private
exhibition
of
his
own
under
the
title
of
pictures
from
the
highlands
by
g
hamerton
and
before
one
of
the
pictures
was
begun
he
had
made
the
model
of
a
die
bearing
this
inscription
to
be
stamped
on
the
frames
of
the
pictures
as
well
as
on
the
studies
hamerton
had
taken
lessons
from
a
photographer
in
paris
at
the
time
of
his
first
visit
there
thinking
it
might
be
a
help
in
the
prosecution
of
his
scheme
and
now
he
was
always
trying
to
get
some
photographs
of
the
scenes
among
which
he
camped
they
were
generally
very
poor
and
feeble
the
weather
being
so
often
unpropitious
and
the
process
paper
process
so
imperfect
and
tedious
still
it
was
the
means
of
giving
pleasure
to
our
relations
and
friends
by
acquainting
them
with
our
surroundings
here
is
a
passage
from
one
of
my
father
letters
in
acknowledgment
of
the
photograph
of
our
house
re√ßu

merci
donc
et
de
bon

although
my
husband
firmly
believed
that
nature
had
meant
him
to
be
an
artist
and
helped
nature
as
much
as
he
could
by
his
own
exertions
the
literary
talent
which
was
in
him
would
not
be
stifled
altogether
and
under
pretext
of
preparing
a
way
for
his
artistic
reputation
made
him
undertake
the
painter
camp
it
may
be
easily
realized
that
with
his
elaborate
system
of
study
which
required
journeys
and
camping
out
the
taking
of
photographs
painting
indoors
in
wet
weather
together
with
a
course
of
reading
for
culture
and
pleasure
and
in
addition
literary
composition
gilbert
time
was
fully
occupied
still
he
was
dissatisfied
by
the
meagre
result
and
fretted
about
it
he
had
at
the
cost
of
much
thought
and
money
organized
a
perfect
establishment
with
wagons
tents
and
boats
to
go
and
stay
wherever
he
pleased
but
wherever
he
went
or
stopped
he
almost
invariably
met
with
rain
and
mist
and
though
he
could
draw
or
paint
inside
the
tent
he
still
required
to
see
his
subject
and
how
could
he
possibly
when
the
heavy
enveloped
the
mountains
as
if
in
a
shroud
or
when
the
mist
threw
a
veil
over
all
the
landscape
i
remember
going
with
him
to
camp
out
in
glencoe
in
delightful
weather
which
lasted
for
a
wonder
throughout
the
journey
and
the
day
following
it
after
which
we
were
shut
inside
the
tents
by
pouring
or
drizzling
rain
for
six
consecutive
days
when
the
only
possible
occupation
was
reading
so
that
at
last
we
were
beaten
back
home
with
a
few
bad
photographs
and
incomplete
sketches
as
the
fruits
of
a
week
expedition
at
first
we
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
the
weather
even
if
it
wasted
time
my
husband
had
taken
the
island
on
a
lease
of
four
years
and
it
seemed
to
us
that
almost
anything
might
be
achieved
in
the
course
of
four
years
we
were
so
young
both
of
us
he
and
i
nineteen
that
we
had
not
yet
realized
how
rapidly
time
flows
and
it
flowed
so
delightfully
with
us
as
to
make
everything
promising
in
our
eyes
the
rain
might
be
troublesome
and
interfere
with
work
but
were
not
the
splendid
colors
of
the
landscape
due
to
it
the
lake
might
be
stormy
and
the
white
foam
of
its
waves
dash
even
upon
the
panes
of
our
windows
but
the
clouds
driven
wildly
over
the
crests
of
the
hills
and
rent
by
peaks
and
crags
cast
shadows
along
their
swift
course
and
the
shafts
of
the
sun
darting
between
them
clothed
the
spaces
between
in
dazzling
splendor
our
enjoyment
of
natural
beauty
was
not
marred
by
considerations
about
the
elements
which
produced
it
whether
the
rich
color
of
the
shrivelled
ferns
on
the
hillside
had
been
given
by
the
fierce
heat
of
a
sun
which
at
the
same
time
had
dried
up
the
streams
and
parched
the
meadows
we
did
not
inquire
and
if
the
grandeur
of
the
stormy
lake
on
a
dark
night
with
the
moaning
of
the
breakers
on
the
rocky
shore
and
the
piercing
shrieks
of
the
blast
involved
the
fall
and
ruin
of
many
a
poor
man
cottage
and
the
destruction
of
hundreds
of
uprooted
trees
we
were
so
entranced
in
admiration
as
to
give
no
thought
to
the
consequences
we
derived
pleasure
from
everything
study
or
contemplation
fair
weather
or
foul
a
twilight
ramble
on
the
island
by
the
magnificent
northern
lights
or
a
quiet
sail
on
the
solitary
lake
perfumed
with
the
fragrance
of
the
honeysuckle
or
of
the
blue
hyacinths
growing
so
profusely
on
inishail
and
the
black
isles
well
we
were
happy
we
did
not
stop
to
consider
if
we
were
happy
but
it
was
without
a
doubt
the
happiest
time
of
our
lives
for
we
have
always
turned
back
to
it
with
deep
regret
and
as
my
husband
has
expressed
it
in
the
painter
camp
it
is
so
full
of
associations
and
memories
which
are
so
infinitely
dear
and
sweet
and
sacred
that
the
very
word
will
lay
a
sudden
charm
on
my
heart
forever
although
we
made
no
dissection
of
our
happiness
to
know
what
it
was
made
of
there
was
a
powerful
element
in
it
which
i
discern
clearly
now
we
were
satisfied
with
ourselves
thinking
we
were
fulfilling
our
duty
to
the
best
of
our
understanding
if
we
erred
it
was
unconsciously
since
then
we
have
not
been
so
positive
and
sometimes
have
questioned
the
wisdom
of
those
days
but
who
can
tell
if
my
husband
had
not
lived
those
four
years
of
highland
life
he
would
not
have
been
the
man
he
became
and
his
literary
gift
though
perhaps
developed
in
some
other
way
would
never
have
acquired
the
charm
which
influenced
afterwards
so
many
minds
and

chapter
iv
english
and
french
my
husband
first
journey
to
france
after
our
friends
in
miss
susan
hamerton
the
summer
of
had
been
unusually
warm
and
pleasant
in
the
highlands
and
my
husband
had
put
many
a
study
in
his
portfolios
in
spite
of
the
interruptions
to
his
work
caused
by
a
series
of
boils
which
though
of
no
importance
were
exceedingly
painful
and
irritating
being
accompanied
by
fever
and
sleeplessness
they
were
the
result
of
a
regimen
of
salted
meat
and
an
insufficiency
of
fresh
vegetables
for
of
course
those
we
succeeded
in
growing
the
first
year
were
only
fit
for
the
table
towards
the
end
of
summer
we
had
not
been
so
solitary
as
i
had
expected
for
with
the
warm
weather
a
few
families
had
come
back
to
their
residences
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
had
called
upon
us
i
had
felt
rather
timid
and
awkward
as
i
could
not
speak
english
but
the
ladies
being
kindly
disposed
and
generally
knowing
a
little
french
we
managed
to
get
on
friendly
terms
particularly
when
left
to
ourselves
for
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
gilbert
strictures
i
will
explain
for
what
reasons
in
particular
he
was
as
i
have
said
before
a
very
good
and
competent
teacher
but
very
exacting
and
he
had
repeatedly
said
that
he
could
put
up
better
with
my
faults
were
they
the
usual
recognized
mistakes
of
a
foreigner
but
that
unluckily
mine
were
vulgarisms
this
was
very
humiliating
as
i
must
confess
i
took
a
little
pride
in
my
french
which
had
been
often
praised
as
elegant
and
pure
and
this
had
fostered
in
me
a
taste
for
conversation
such
as
was
still
to
be
enjoyed
in
intelligent
french
society
at
that
time
and
of
which
i
had
never
been
deprived
at
home
my
father
being
an
excellent
conversationalist
and
receiving
political
friends
of
great
talent
as
orators
and
debaters
such
as
michel
de
bourges
baudin
boysset
and
many
others
as
well
as
literary
people
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
explained
that
i
was
unknown
to
my
husband
relations
and
aware
of
some
prejudices
against
me
among
them
particularly
on
the
part
of
his
aunt
susan
the
younger
of
the
two
sisters
who
had
brought
him
up
she
only
knew
that
i
was
french
a
roman
catholic
and
without
fortune
all
these
defects
were
the
very
opposite
of
what
she
had
dreamt
of
for
her
nephew
and
her
disappointment
had
been
so
bitter
when
she
had
heard
of
his
engagement
that
to
excuse
it
in
her
own
eyes
she
had
convinced
herself
that
a
french
girl
could
only
be
flippant
extravagantly
fond
of
amusement
and
neglectful
of
homely
duties
a
roman
catholic
must
of
necessity
be
and
bigoted
and
the
want
of
fortune
betrayed
low
birth
and
lack
of
education
these
views
had
been
expressed
at
length
to
my
betrothed
together
with
severe
reproaches
and
admonitions
and
it
was
in
vain
that
he
had
attempted
to
justify
his
choice
his
aunt
persisted
in
attributing
it
solely
to
a
passion
he
had
been
too
weak
to
master
at
last
our
marriage
drawing
near
gilbert
wrote
to
his
aunt
that
if
her
next
letter
contained
anything
disrespectful
to
me
he
would
return
it
and
do
the
same
for
the
following
ones
without
opening
them
and
the
correspondence
had
ceased
it
was
quite
different
with
his
aunt
mary
who
must
also
have
been
disappointed
by
his
marriage
for
with
her
aristocratic
tastes
and
notions
she
had
desired
for
her
nephew
a
bride
of
rank
and
an
heiress
to
put
him
again
in
the
station
befitting
the
family
name
to
which
his
education
and
talents
seemed
to
entitle
him
but
she
had
confidence
in
his
judgment
and
loved
him
with
so
generous
a
love
that
she
congratulated
him
warmly
when
he
was
accepted
and
wrote
me
an
affectionate
letter
of
thanks
and
a
welcome
as
a
new
member
of
the
family
of
course
my
husband
had
often
talked
to
me
about
his
aunts
not
much
was
said
of
miss
susan
but
a
great
deal
of
his
dear
guardian
who
had
been
like
a
mother
to
him
and
who
now
wrote
encouragingly
to
me
from
time
to
time
about
my
english
and
my
new
life
he
praised
both
his
aunts
for
their
good
management
of
a
small
income
for
the
position
they
had
been
able
to
retain
in
society
and
particularly
for
their
manners
and
good
breeding
explaining
sometimes
that
i
should
probably
find
it
different
in
some
respects
from
french
and
mentioning
in
what
particulars
i
felt
that
he
would
be
very
sensitive
about
the
opinions
his
aunts
would
form
of
me
and
i
dreaded
that
of
miss
susan
hamerton
he
had
put
me
on
my
guard
on
some
points
for
instance
about
the
french
custom
of
always
addressing
people
as
monsieur
or
madame
which
was
hard
for
me
to
relinquish
as
it
seemed
rude
and
i
was
also
told
not
to
be
always
thanking
servants
for
their
services
as
we
do
in
france
if
i
wished
to
be
considered
but
besides
what
was
pointed
out
to
me
i
noticed
many
other
things
which
ought
to
be
toned
down
in
my
nature
and
habits
if
i
meant
to
acquire
what
i
heard
called
manners
i
was
at
that
time
very
vivacious
merry
and
impulsive
and
so
long
as
i
had
lived
in
france
this
natural
disposition
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
happy
one
and
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
but
i
did
not
notice
anything
resembling
it
in
our
visitors
who
were
said
to
be
real
ladies
or
they
looked
to
my
french
eyes
somewhat
indifferent
and
unconcerned
it
is
true
that
they
were
all
my
seniors
by
at
least
of
years
but
the
fact
did
not
put
me
more
at
ease
however
as
they
showed
great
kindness
and
frequently
renewed
their
visits
and
invitations
i
was
led
to
think
that
their
judgment
had
not
gone
against
me
and
this
gave
me
some
courage
for
the
day
of
my
meeting
with
my
aunt
susan
and
that
day
was
drawing
near
my
husband
having
promised
his
relations
that
we
should
visit
them
after
six
months
which
was
the
delay
granted
to
me
to
learn
a
little
english
and
although
i
could
not
and
dared
not
speak
it
at
the
end
of
the
allotted
time
no
respite
was
allowed
it
was
arranged
that
after
our
stay
in
lancashire
we
should
go
on
to
paris
this
news
was
received
with
great
joy
and
thankfulness
in
my
family
where
we
had
not
been
expected
so
soon
and
where
the
sorrow
for
my
absence
was
still
so
keen
that
my
father
wrote
to
my
husband
chaque
fois
que
je
rentre
je
√†
la
voir
accourir
au
devant
de
moi
et
chaque
d√©sillusion
est
suivie
de
tristesse
il
pas
piano
dont
le
mutisme
me
fait
mal
beau
me
dire
que
ces
impatiences
ces
chagrins
sont
de
la
faiblesse
je
le
sais
je
le
sens
et
je
suis
pas
plus
fort
the
love
of
improvements
which
was
one
of
gilbert
characteristics
had
led
him
to
plan
a
road
on
the
island
which
should
go
from
the
house
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
shore
where
the
lake
dried
up
in
summer
so
as
to
facilitate
the
conveyance
of
goods
which
could
then
be
carted
without
unloading
from
inverary
to
the
barn
or
he
gave
very
minute
directions
to
thursday
and
dugald
and
set
them
to
their
work
just
before
we
left
for
france
telling
them
that
he
expected
to
find
the
road
finished
on
our
return
we
started
in
november
and
arrived
at
todmorden
on
a
wet
day
and
just
before
leaving
the
railway
carriage
we
were
much
amused
by
a
gentleman
who
answered
the
query
is
this
todmorden
by
letting
down
the
window
and
thrusting
his
hand
out
after
which
he
gravely
said
it
is
raining
it
must
be
todmorden
my
husband
uncle
thomas
hamerton
with
his
two
daughters
was
awaiting
us
at
the
station
to
welcome
us
and
take
us
to
his
house
where
we
found
hamerton
who
received
us
very
kindly
but
called
me
philip
gilbert
because
she
despaired
of
ever
pronouncing
my
christian
name
rightly
i
begged
her
to
call
me
niece
and
her
husband
gave
the
example
by
calling
me
my
niece
eugene√Ø
our
cousins
anne
and
jane
spoke
french
very
creditably
although
they
had
never
been
in
france
and
we
were
soon
on
friendly
terms
when
my
husband
was
away
they
translated
my
answers
to
their
mother
numerous
questions
about
our
life
in
the
highlands
my
occupations
tastes
french
habits
and
what
not
although
my
powers
of
expression
in
english
were
very
limited
i
understood
the
greater
part
of
what
was
said
and
hamerton
and
my
cousins
being
so
encouraging
i
did
not
feel
so
timid
and
if
i
had
stayed
longer
i
should
most
certainly
have
made
rapid
progress
on
that
score
my
husband
as
they
called
him
in
the
family
circle
was
taken
to
task
and
scolded
for
having
been
too
severe
with
his
poor
little
foreign
wife
his
cousins
with
whom
he
was
on
brotherly
terms
were
much
pleased
with
the
soft
french
pronunciation
of
the
name
gilbert
and
dropped
the
decisively
to
the
great
wonder
of
their
mamma
the
following
day
was
fixed
by
my
husband
as
the
day
of
our
trial
that
is
for
our
visit
to
his
aunts
who
lived
on
a
steep
eminence
above
todmorden
in
a
pleasant
house
the
jumps
aunt
mary
in
order
to
spare
me
had
offered
to
come
down
to
meet
us
at
her
brother
but
as
she
suffered
from
some
kind
of
heart
complaint
the
knowledge
of
which
kept
her
loving
nephew
in
constant
alarm
we
were
afraid
of
the
effect
that
fatigue
and
emotion
might
have
and
preferred
to
encounter
miss
susan
hamerton
the
reception
was
typical
of
the
different
dispositions
towards
us
aunt
mary
was
standing
at
the
door
straining
her
eyes
to
see
us
sooner
and
came
forward
to
embrace
me
and
to
receive
the
kisses
of
her
beloved
nephew
then
she
whispered
that
she
had
hoped
susan
would
have
gone
away
on
a
visit
to
her
friends
but
she
had
remained
obdurate
to
all
hints
and
entreaties
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
meet
her
since
she
would
have
it
so
and
with
a
beating
heart
i
was
led
to
the
by
my
husband
that
the
reader
may
not
be
misled
into
believing
that
a
estrangement
resulted
from
the
following
scene
i
will
quote
a
passage
from
the
preface
to
human
intercourse
which
gives
the
unforeseen
result
of
my
acquaintance
with
miss
susan
hamerton
a
certain
english
lady
influenced
by
the
received
ideas
about
human
intercourse
which
define
the
conditions
of
it
in
a
hard
and
sharp
manner
was
strongly
convinced
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
have
friendly
relations
with
another
lady
whom
she
had
never
seen
but
was
likely
to
see
frequently
all
her
reasons
would
be
considered
excellent
reasons
by
those
who
believe
in
maxims
and
rules
it
was
plain
that
there
could
be
nothing
in
common
the
other
lady
was
neither
of
the
same
country
nor
of
the
same
religious
and
political
parties
nor
of
the
same
generation
these
facts
were
known
and
the
inference
deduced
from
them
was
that
intercourse
would
be
impossible
after
some
time
the
english
lady
began
to
perceive
that
the
case
did
not
bear
out
the
supposed
rules
she
discovered
that
the
younger
lady
might
be
an
acceptable
friend
at
last
the
full
strange
truth
became
apparent
that
she
was
singularly
well
adapted
better
adapted
than
any
other
human
being
to
take
a
filial
relation
to
the
elder
especially
in
times
of
sickness
when
her
presence
was
a
wonderful
support
then
the
warmest
affection
sprang
up
between
the
two
lasting
till
separation
by
death
and
still
cherished
by
the
survivor
but
the
first
meeting
held
out
no
such
promise
there
on
the
couch
was
an
elderly
lady
sitting
stiff
and
straight
with
a
book
in
her
hands
from
which
her
eyes
were
never
raised
even
when
she
acknowledged
our
entrance
by
a
studiously
slow
chilling
and
almost
imperceptible
bend
of
the
head
i
saw
my
husband
face
flush
with
anger
as
we
bowed
to
my
new
relation
but
i
pressed
his
hand
entreatingly
and
we
sat
down
attempting
to
ignore
the
hostile
presence
and
to
talk
as
if
we
found
ourselves
in
ordinary
circumstances
poor
aunt
mary
thinking
it
must
be
unendurable
to
me
soon
proposed
that
we
should
go
to
the
for
refreshments
and
her
proposition
was
accepted
with
alacrity
we
left
the
with
the
same
ceremonial
which
had
followed
our
entrance
and
were
rewarded
by
the
same
frigid
and
distant
movement
of
the
silent
figure
on
the
sofa
we
remained
some
time
with
aunt
mary
and
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
her
my
husband
giving
a
promise
that
on
our
return
journey
we
would
stay
a
few
days
at
the
jumps
whether
her
sister
chose
to
be
at
home
or
away
i
have
related
this
episode
at
some
length
although
it
seems
to
concern
me
more
than
my
husband
because
the
influence
it
had
on
his
life
was
so
important
it
is
almost
certain
that
if
miss
susan
hamerton
had
behaved
towards
us
like
her
sister
my
husband
would
never
have
thought
of
going
to
live
in
france
at
the
end
of
our
lease
at
innistrynich
he
would
have
chosen
a
residence
in
some
picturesque
part
of
england
and
would
have
easily
induced
his
aunts
to
settle
as
near
as
possible
to
us
their
example
and
advice
in
household
matters
would
have
been
invaluable
to
me
whilst
the
affectionate
intercourse
would
have
grown
closer
and
dearer
as
we
came
to
know
each
other
better
however
this
was
not
to
be
we
soon
left
todmorden
after
our
visit
to
the
jumps
and
when
we
reached
paris
there
were
great
rejoicings
in
my
family
where
my
husband
was
fully
appreciated
he
liked
to
talk
of
politics
literature
and
art
with
my
father
whose
experience
was
extensive
and
whose
taste
was
refined
and
discriminating
he
awoke
in
his
an
interest
in
sculpture
which
hitherto
had
not
been
developed
but
which
grew
with
years
as
to
my
mother
brothers
and
sister
they
loved
him
for
his
kindness
and
also
because
he
had
made
a
life
of
happiness
for
me
in
paris
we
went
to
see
everything
of
artistic
interest
but
especially
of
architectural
interest
i
knew
nothing
of
architecture
myself
but
was
naturally
attracted
by
beauty
and
my
husband
guided
my
opinions
with
his
knowledge
i
noticed
with
surprise
his
indifference
to
most
of
the
pictures
in
the
museum
of
the
louvre
and
he
explained
later
that
he
could
not
appreciate
them
at
that
period
in
the
development
of
his
artistic
taste
which
was
at
that
time
retarded
by
the
influence
there
was
certainly
a
great
evolution
of
mind
between
this
state
of
and
the
fervid
enthusiasm
which
made
him
say
to
me
when
we
came
to
live
in
paris
at
any
rate
there
is
for
me
as
a
compensation
for
the
beauty
of
natural
scenery
an
inexhaustible
source
of
interest
and
study
in
the
louvre
the
museum
of
the
luxembourg
containing
several
pictures
by
modern
artists
whose
merits
he
recognized
was
frequently
visited
by
us
and
he
admired
heartily
among
others
rosa
bonheur
daubigny
charles
jacque
and
especially
troyon
whose
works
went
far
to
shake
his
faith
in
topographic
painting
and
sowed
the
first
seeds
of
the
french
school
influence
on
his
mind
at
the
expiration
of
the
month
we
returned
to
london
and
stayed
with
friends
my
husband
introduced
me
to
and
mackay
to
leslie
and
her
family
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
constable
of
whom
he
speaks
in
his
autobiography
and
they
all
received
me
very
kindly
and
told
me
what
hopeful
views
they
entertained
of
his
future
career
we
also
called
upon
millais
for
whose
talent
my
husband
had
a
great
admiration
he
received
us
quite
informally
and
we
had
a
long
talk
in
french
which
he
pronounced
remarkably
well
he
explained
it
to
me
by
saying
that
he
belonged
to
a
jersey
family
it
was
also
during
this
london
visit
that
hamerton
made
the
acquaintance
of
calderon
who
also
spoke
french
admirably
an
acquaintance
which
was
to
ripen
into
friendship
and
last
to
the
end
of
my
husband
life
he
also
went
to
all
the
winter
exhibitions
public
or
private
where
he
stood
rooted
before
all
the
works
which
could
teach
him
something
of
his
difficult
art
and
when
we
left
he
was
certain
of
having
acquired
new
knowledge
miss
susan
hamerton
having
said
to
aunt
mary
that
she
had
no
objection
to
our
being
her
sister
guests
we
went
straight
to
the
jumps
after
leaving
london
this
time
she
received
us
with
polite
coldness
like
perfect
strangers
but
she
was
not
insulting
only
at
times
somewhat
ungenerously
sarcastic
with
me
who
was
not
armed
to
parry
her
thrusts
i
felt
quite
miserable
for
i
did
not
wish
to
widen
the
gap
between
her
and
her
nephew
and
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
see
how
our
intercourse
could
be
made
more
pleasant
by
any
endeavors
of
mine
for
i
was
ignorant
of
the
art
of
ingratiating
myself
with
persons
whom
i
felt
adverse
to
me
and
i
must
avow
that
i
had
also
a
certain
degree
of
pride
which
prevented
me
from
making
advances
when
unfairly
treated
i
had
always
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
confidence
love
and
goodwill
perhaps
i
had
been
a
little
spoilt
by
the
kindness
of
my
friends
and
now
it
seemed
hard
to
be
a
butt
for
sarcasms
these
shafts
however
were
seldom
if
ever
let
loose
in
the
presence
of
my
husband
who
would
not
have
tolerated
it
the
want
of
welcome
being
as
much
as
he
could
bear
still
there
was
no
doubt
that
matters
had
slightly
mended
since
our
first
visit
and
an
undeniable
token
of
this
was
the
fact
of
miss
susan
hamerton
extending
her
hand
to
each
of
us
at
parting
had
i
been
told
then
that
this
reluctant
hand
would
become
a
firm
support
for
me
that
these
cold
eyes
would
he
filled
with
warm
tears
of
love
and
that
i
should
be
tenderly
pressed
to
this
apparently
unsympathizing
bosom
i
could
not
have
believed
it
yet
the
day
came
when
aunt
susan
proved
my
dearest
friend
and
when
thomas
hamerton
said
to
his
nephew
susan
loves
you
much
no
doubt
but
eug√©nie
is
for
her
chapter
visits
from
friends
and
a
frenchman
in
the
project
of
buying
the
island
of
innistrynich
when
we
arrived
at
innistrynich
from
the
continent
all
our
neighbors
had
left
loch
awe
and
we
had
only
as
occasional
visitors
the
doctor
and
our
landlord
the
rare
and
calls
of
the
minister
ceasing
with
the
fine
days
but
we
were
not
afraid
of
our
solitude
and
we
had
the
pleasant
prospect
of
entertaining
aunt
mary
and
anne
hamerton
early
in
the
summer
as
well
as
the
husband
of
my
godmother
souverain
a
parisian
publisher
whose
acquaintance
hamerton
had
made
through
my
father
and
who
had
promised
to
come
to
see
us
meanwhile
we
resumed
our
usual
rules
of
work
and
my
husband
began
several
oil
pictures
at
once
so
as
to
lose
no
time
in
having
to
wait
for
the
drying
of
the
colors
as
he
had
made
great
progress
in
his
french
he
proposed
that
we
should
change
our
parts
and
that
nothing
but
english
should
be
spoken
read
or
written
by
me
except
my
letters
to
french
correspondents
i
delayed
my
submission
a
while
for
it
seemed
that
if
i
could
not
speak
even
to
him
confidentially
and
with
perfect
ease
that
indeed
would
be
solitude
at
last
i
yielded
to
his
entreaties
strengthened
by
my
father
remonstrances
and
some
months
of
constantly
renewed
endeavors
not
always
successful
and
sometimes
accompanied
by
weariness
discouragement
and
tears
began
for
me
my
teacher
never
swerving
from
his
rule
not
even
when
despairing
of
making
myself
understood
i
used
a
french
word
or
expression
on
such
occasions
he
invariably
shook
his
head
and
said
i
do
not
understand
french
speak
english
at
the
same
time
helping
me
out
of
my
difficulty
as
much
as
he
could
aunt
mary
and
anne
hamerton
had
promised
to
come
to
see
us
during
the
summer
and
we
had
repeated
our
invitation
in
the
beginning
of
the
spring
of
but
aunt
mary
wrote
to
her
nephew
i
am
looking
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
my
visit
to
you
and
eug√©nie
but
i
think
i
had
not
come
till
the
little
cherub
has
come
because
anybody
would
know
better
what
to
do
than
i
should
she
wrote
again
on
june
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
eug√©nie
and
the
dear
little
boy
are
doing
well
give
my
very
best
love
to
eug√©nie
and
tell
her
that
now
anne
and
i
are
looking
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
visiting
you
as
soon
as
we
can
they
came
in
july
and
aunt
mary
was
delighted
with
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
with
the
strong
and
healthy
appearance
of
her
little
whom
she
held
in
her
arms
as
much
and
as
long
as
her
strength
allowed
but
especially
by
the
recovered
affectionate
intimacy
with
my
husband
and
also
by
the
certainty
of
our
domestic
happiness
anne
hamerton
greatly
enjoyed
the
excursions
on
land
and
water
and
so
the
days
passed
pleasantly
when
my
husband
was
painting
either
in
his
studio
or
we
sat
near
him
and
read
aloud
by
turns
aunt
mary
was
very
fond
of
moore
poetry
and
read
it
well
and
feelingly
though
her
voice
was
rather
tremulous
and
weak
to
anne
were
given
passages
of
modern
painters
as
examples
of
style
and
jocelyn
for
french
pronunciation
i
fear
that
aunt
mary
appreciation
of
it
was
more
imaginary
than
real
the
newcomes
fell
to
my
lot
being
easier
than
poetry
and
gave
rise
to
many
a
debate
about
its
superiority
or
inferiority
to
thackeray
other
works
as
an
author
he
was
not
justly
appreciated
by
aunt
mary
who
on
account
of
her
aristocratic
loyalty
did
not
forgive
him
for
the
four
georges
we
had
also
a
good
deal
of
music
my
husband
having
been
accustomed
to
play
duets
with
his
cousin
soon
resumed
the
practice
and
though
i
had
not
encouraged
him
as
a
i
liked
well
enough
to
listen
to
his
violin
with
a
piano
accompaniment
anne
playing
was
only
mediocre
but
as
she
did
not
attempt
anything
above
her
skill
it
was
pleasant
enough
she
accompanied
all
the
french
songs
i
had
brought
with
me
and
they
were
numerous
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
in
paris
homely
or
fashionable
without
the
public
taste
was
not
so
fastidious
as
it
has
since
become
and
did
not
expect
from
a
the
performance
of
an
operatic
prima
donna
when
out
in
the
boat
on
a
peaceful
and
serene
night
my
husband
rowing
us
slowly
on
the
glassy
water
it
seemed
that
the
melodies
which
rose
and
spread
in
the
hazy
atmosphere
were
the
natural
complement
to
these
enchanted
hours
anne
often
sang
beautiful
star
or
long
time
ago
and
i
was
always
asked
for
le
lac
or
la
chanson
de
fortunio
the
arrival
of
monsieur
souverain
added
a
new
element
of
cheerfulness
to
our
little
party
he
was
so
thoroughly
french
that
is
so
ignorant
of
other
habits
than
french
ones
so
na√Øvely
persuaded
of
their
superiority
to
all
others
so
keenly
alive
to
any
point
of
difference
and
so
openly
astonished
when
he
discovered
any
always
wondering
at
the
reason
for
this
want
of
similarity
that
he
was
a
perpetual
source
of
interest
to
our
lady
visitors
he
could
not
speak
english
but
he
always
addressed
aunt
mary
in
his
voluble
and
rapid
parisian
french
and
she
was
all
smiles
and
appeared
to
enjoy
extremely
his
run
of
anecdotes
about
french
celebrities
she
had
never
heard
of
now
and
then
she
let
fall
a
word
or
sometimes
a
phrase
totally
irrelevant
to
what
he
had
been
saying
but
which
in
his
turn
he
politely
pretended
to
appreciate
although
he
had
not
understood
a
single
syllable
of
it
it
was
most
amusing
to
see
them
walking
side
by
side
evidently
enjoying
each
other
society
and
animated
conversation
only
we
remarked
that
they
were
careful
to
remain
well
out
of
profane
hearing
by
keeping
a
good
deal
in
front
of
us
or
else
loitering
behind
we
had
been
awaiting
souverain
for
some
days
no
date
having
been
fixed
when
one
morning
our
attention
was
aroused
by
loud
and
prolonged
shouts
coming
from
that
part
of
the
road
which
affords
a
view
of
innistrynich
before
descending
to
the
bay
with
the
help
of
his
telescope
my
husband
soon
discovered
a
small
spare
human
form
now
waving
a
and
now
making
a
of
both
hands
to
carry
its
appeal
as
far
as
the
island
it
must
be
souverain
gilbert
said
as
he
sent
a
shout
of
welcome
and
ran
to
the
pier
to
loosen
the
boat
and
row
it
across
the
bay
he
had
scarcely
landed
our
visitor
when
enthusiastic
ejaculations
met
our
ears
mais
le
paradis
terrestre
ici
quel
pays
de
r√™ve
quel
s√©jour
enchanteur
then
with
a
change
of
tone
habitual
to
him
and
a
little
sarcastic
yes
but
as
difficult
to
find
as
i
thought
i
should
have
to
turn
back
to
france
without
meeting
with
you
for
no
one
seemed
to
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
ave
any
more
than
of
and
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
your
descriptions
to
have
been
purely
imaginary
when
trait
de
illuminated
my
brain
i
bought
a
map
of
scotland
and
without
troubling
myself
any
longer
with
the
impossible
pronunciation
of
impossible
names
i
stuck
a
pin
on
the
spot
of
the
map
that
i
wanted
to
reach
and
showed
it
either
to
a
railway
or
to
a
and
i
was
sure
to
hear
right
i
have
learnt
that
at
least
but
upon
my
life
to
this
day
i
ca
explain
why
no
one
seemed
to
understand
me
even
at
inverary
at
the
hotel
i
asked
chemin
doit
on
prendre
pour
aller
chez
monsieur
amertone
dans
sur
le
lac
ave
that
was
quite
plain
was
not
it
well
they
only
shook
their
heads
till
i
gave
them
the
address
you
had
written
for
me
then
of
course
they
came
out
with
right
and
a
good
deal
besides
which
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
and
at
last
i
am
here
right
but
why
on
earth
do
they
spell
londres
london
glascow
glasgow
and
cantorb√©ry
canterbury
it
is
exceedingly
puzzling
to
strangers
my
husband
was
greatly
tickled
and
rather
encouraged
this
flow
of
impressions
he
thought
it
extremely
interesting
in
a
cultivated
and
intelligent
man
who
was
far
from
untravelled
for
he
had
been
in
spain
belgium
germany
italy
and
algeria
and
who
still
evinced
a
childlike
wonder
at
every
unfamiliar
object
for
instance
he
would
say
now
hamerton
i
am
sure
you
ca
justify
this
queer
custom
in
english
hotels
of
putting
on
the
table
a
roast
of
eight
pounds
weight
or
a
whole
cheese
i
ca
eat
all
that
then
why
serve
it
me
and
why
also
those
immense
they
are
so
cumbersome
and
heavy
that
it
is
almost
as
much
as
i
can
achieve
to
empty
them
i
do
take
a
bath
in
them
i
take
it
in
a
and
i
have
not
to
empty
it
the
conversation
however
often
ran
on
serious
subjects
and
souverain
heard
with
deep
interest
from
my
husband
an
account
of
his
plans
both
literary
and
artistic
and
said
once
if
you
intend
to
devote
your
life
to
painting
highland
scenery
and
since
your
wife
loves
this
admirable
island
as
much
as
you
do
why
should
not
you
buy
it
and
secure
the
benefit
of
the
improvements
you
are
carrying
on
it
is
somewhat
solitary
at
times
no
doubt
but
as
you
will
be
obliged
to
go
to
london
and
paris
every
year
at
least
you
might
arrange
to
do
so
in
winter
and
enjoy
society
there
and
a
change
at
the
same
time
you
tell
me
that
your
property
yields
at
present
but
a
very
poor
income
why
not
sell
it
or
part
of
it
since
it
has
no
attraction
for
you
and
live
here
on
your
own
property
free
of
rent
gilbert
himself
had
entertained
the
idea
and
had
developed
it
to
me
with
flattering
possibilities
and
speculations
but
i
was
already
beginning
to
fear
that
our
present
existence
was
too
exquisite
to
last
we
had
received
bad
news
from
uncle
thomas
about
the
rents
the
mill
was
not
let
and
would
require
a
heavy
outlay
before
it
could
find
a
tenant
the
machinery
was
old
and
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
new
with
the
modern
improvements
and
the
cottages
surrounding
the
mill
were
likely
to
remain
tenantless
so
long
as
the
mill
did
not
work
or
the
rents
be
but
irregularly
forthcoming
in
fact
our
income
was
already
insufficient
and
my
husband
was
seriously
considering
whether
he
ought
to
borrow
in
order
to
set
up
the
mill
again
or
whether
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
sell
the
property
and
draw
upon
the
capital
as
we
required
it
till
he
could
sell
his
pictures
at
last
he
decided
to
consult
his
uncle
who
was
a
prudent
man
of
business
and
had
a
long
experience
as
landed
proprietor
after
due
consideration
hamerton
advised
him
to
go
to
the
necessary
expense
for
repairs
to
the
mill
meanwhile
souverain
was
growing
more
enchanted
with
loch
awe
day
by
day
and
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
we
might
be
turned
out
of
innistrynich
some
day
by
a
new
owner
for
the
present
one
was
getting
old
and
had
said
that
at
the
end
of
our
lease
he
would
put
it
up
for
sale
so
he
tempted
my
husband
by
the
almost
irresistible
offer
of
a
third
of
the
purchase
money
in
consideration
of
having
two
rooms
reserved
for
himself
and
his
wife
my
godmother
during
two
of
the
summer
months
but
aunt
mary
secret
desire
and
perhaps
hope
of
seeing
us
established
at
a
future
time
nearer
to
herself
suggested
some
very
weighty
considerations
against
the
project
when
your
child
or
maybe
children
grow
up
and
have
to
attend
school
will
you
resign
yourselves
to
send
them
so
far
as
will
be
inevitable
if
you
are
still
here
she
said
and
will
your
healths
be
able
to
stand
the
severity
of
the
climate
when
you
are
no
longer
so
young
the
distance
from
a
doctor
is
another
serious
affair
in
case
of
sickness
and
i
myself
as
well
as
eug√©nie
parents
am
on
the
downward
course
and
may
soon
be
deprived
of
the
possibility
of
undertaking
so
fatiguing
a
journey
all
this
had
been
foreseen
by
her
nephew
of
course
but
his
attachment
to
the
place
was
such
that
he
found
ready
answers
to
all
objections
our
children
would
be
educated
at
home
the
climate
though
damp
was
not
more
severe
or
unhealthy
than
the
average
doctors
were
of
no
good
generally
speaking
and
we
might
visit
our
relations
more
frequently
in
case
they
were
unable
to
come
to
us
so
the
question
remained
open
gilbert
thinking
it
desirable
to
give
his
guests
a
more
extensive
acquaintance
with
the
surrounding
country
than
his
boats
could
afford
proposed
to
take
a
carriage
which
would
be
ferried
from
port
sonachan
to
the
other
side
of
the
lake
after
which
we
might
drive
as
much
as
possible
along
the
shores
till
we
reached
ardhonnel
castle
if
we
arrived
early
we
would
visit
the
ruins
and
the
island
if
too
late
it
would
be
reserved
for
the
following
morning
as
we
intended
to
spend
the
night
at
the
inn
and
to
resume
our
drive
in
time
to
be
back
at
innistrynich
for
dinner
we
started
merrily
aunt
mary
anne
hamerton
souverain
my
husband
myself
and
baby
for
our
guests
kindly
insisted
upon
my
being
one
of
the
party
in
spite
of
my
small
encumbrance
which
i
could
not
leave
behind
i
did
my
best
to
be
excused
but
they
were
unanimous
in
declaring
that
they
would
not
go
if
i
stayed
you
need
not
walk
unless
you
like
they
said
for
there
will
always
be
the
carriage
the
boat
or
the
inn
for
you
it
was
a
splendid
day
of
bright
sunshine
in
a
tenderly
blue
sky
with
a
pure
soft
breeze
hardly
rippling
the
lake
we
all
took
our
seats
inside
the
roomy
open
carriage
my
husband
leaving
the
management
of
the
horses
to
the
driver
that
he
might
be
free
to
enjoy
the
scenery
souverain
remarked
that
if
the
highlanders
were
a
strong
race
their
horses
hardly
deserved
the
same
epithet
and
indeed
the
pair
harnessed
to
our
carriage
appeared
very
lean
and
somewhat
shaky
but
the
driver
affirmed
that
they
were
capital
for
though
he
would
not
swear
to
their
swiftness
and
as
we
did
not
want
to
go
fast
it
was
again
all
right
from
souverain
when
the
explanation
had
been
translated
to
him
fast
we
certainly
did
not
go
and
moreover
we
often
stopped
to
admire
the
changing
views
but
the
poor
starved
beasts
did
not
pick
up
any
more
spirit
during
their
frequent
rests
they
painfully
resumed
their
dull
for
a
short
time
which
soon
dwindled
to
slow
weary
paces
that
even
the
whip
in
no
way
hastened
however
with
plenty
of
time
before
us
we
only
turned
it
into
a
joke
pretending
to
be
terrified
by
the
ardor
of
our
steeds
my
husband
had
to
tell
souverain
all
the
legends
of
the
places
we
were
passing
and
as
he
himself
courtisait
la
muse
he
listened
with
rapt
attention
so
as
to
be
able
to
treat
the
subjects
in
french
verse
this
country
is
a
mine
for
a
poet
he
frequently
exclaimed
luckily
we
had
packed
some
provisions
in
the
carriage
for
the
sun
was
already
declining
like
the
pace
of
the
horses
and
we
were
not
yet
at
the
end
of
the
drive
by
a
good
distance
the
fresh
air
had
sharpened
our
appetites
and
gilbert
proposed
that
we
should
have
something
to
eat
whilst
the
horses
were
taken
out
of
harness
and
given
a
feed
to
refresh
them
and
give
them
a
little
more
vigor
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
by
the
time
we
had
finished
our
collation
the
air
had
freshened
and
it
was
twilight
we
agreed
that
now
it
was
desirable
to
get
within
shelter
as
soon
as
possible
although
the
charm
of
the
hour
was
indescribable
but
the
thin
white
mist
was
beginning
to
float
over
the
lake
and
the
last
remnants
of
the
afterglow
had
entirely
died
out
what
was
our
dismay
when
we
found
that
all
my
husband
efforts
joined
to
those
of
the
driver
to
make
the
horses
get
up
were
ineffectual
there
they
lay
on
the
grass
and
neither
expostulations
pulls
cracks
of
the
whip
or
even
kicks
i
am
sorry
to
say
seemed
to
produce
the
slightest
effect
upon
their
determination
to
remain
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
ground
what
were
we
to
do
the
driver
vociferated
in
gaelic
but
the
poor
brutes
did
not
mind
and
they
would
have
been
cruelly
maltreated
if
we
had
not
interfered
to
protect
them
gilbert
said
to
the
man
you
see
well
enough
that
they
have
no
strength
to
work
therefore
allow
them
to
rest
till
they
are
able
to
go
back
i
leave
you
here
and
as
i
have
ladies
with
me
i
must
try
to
find
some
sort
of
shelter
for
the
night
the
man
was
almost
frantic
when
he
saw
us
go
but
we
all
agreed
with
my
husband
and
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
cottage
set
forth
resolutely
on
foot
it
was
now
almost
dark
but
our
spirits
were
not
damped
yet
and
as
souverain
remarked
it
was
une
v√©ritable
aventure
still
i
was
beginning
to
find
my
baby
somewhat
heavy
after
walking
for
of
an
hour
when
the
gentlemen
in
front
of
us
cheerily
encouraged
our
exertions
by
calling
out
a
cottage
a
cottage
and
when
we
came
up
to
them
they
were
loudly
knocking
at
the
door
unable
to
obtain
a
sign
of
life
from
within
however
the
smell
of
burning
peat
clearly
indicated
that
the
cottage
was
inhabited
and
my
husband
shouted
our
story
begging
that
the
door
might
be
opened
and
the
ladies
allowed
to
rest
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
which
remained
closed
a
voice
answered
in
gaelic
we
knew
not
what
except
that
the
tone
of
it
was
unmistakably
angry
and
unbroken
silence
ensued
there
was
nothing
left
to
us
but
to
resume
our
walk
enlivened
by
souverain
singing
the
celebrated
song
chez
les
montagnards
√©cossais
se
donne
etc
every
one
in
turn
offered
to
hold
the
baby
but
aunt
mary
i
knew
had
enough
to
do
for
herself
anne
was
not
strong
and
my
confidence
in
the
fitness
of
the
gentlemen
for
the
function
of
nurse
was
very
limited
my
husband
kept
up
our
courage
by
affirming
that
we
were
not
far
from
ardhonnel
and
consequently
within
a
short
distance
of
the
inn
indeed
he
called
us
to
the
side
of
the
road
from
which
we
could
see
the
noble
ruin
with
our
own
eyes
now
that
the
new
moon
had
risen
and
was
peeping
between
the
clouds
occasionally
it
was
a
welcome
sight
for
by
this
time
we
were
really
weary
but
alas
the
inn
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
we
had
no
boat
still
gilbert
felt
sure
there
must
be
one
not
very
far
off
to
take
the
people
across
and
after
surveying
the
shore
for
a
while
he
discovered
a
little
pier
with
a
chained
to
it
and
a
very
small
cottage
almost
close
to
where
we
stood
so
he
went
to
knock
at
the
door
and
again
gaelic
was
given
in
answer
but
this
time
the
door
was
opened
by
a
woman
who
had
only
taken
time
to
put
on
a
short
petticoat
and
to
throw
a
small
shawl
over
her
head
her
feet
legs
and
arms
were
bare
and
she
looked
strong
and
placid
her
english
was
scanty
but
she
understood
pretty
well
what
we
wanted
and
declared
herself
willing
to
row
our
party
to
the
other
side
if
any
one
could
steer
for
her
man
was
asleep
in
bed
and
too
tired
for
work
so
my
husband
took
a
pair
of
oars
the
woman
another
and
i
steered
from
indications
frequently
given
at
last
we
stood
in
front
of
the
inn
and
it
was
past
midnight
not
a
light
was
visible
not
a
sound
was
heard
and
there
was
no
sign
of
life
except
a
faint
blue
wreath
of
but
it
was
enough
to
revive
our
energies
and
hopes
in
response
to
our
united
appeals
a
dishevelled
head
of
red
hair
cautiously
looked
down
from
a
window
and
our
story
had
to
be
told
again
well
this
time
we
were
let
in
and
allowed
to
sit
down
whilst
the
ostler
wife
was
being
roused
as
well
as
the
servant
for
we
were
told
that
the
tourists
season
being
already
over
the
inn
was
no
longer
in
trim
for
customers
this
was
bad
news
for
the
good
effects
of
the
luncheon
had
passed
off
and
as
soon
as
we
could
rest
and
forget
our
fatigue
we
became
sensible
of
ravenous
hunger
the
good
innkeeper
and
his
wife
were
so
obliging
and
that
they
kept
deprecating
the
absence
of
all
the
comforts
they
would
have
liked
to
give
us
however
my
husband
had
brought
a
large
basket
of
dry
peat
and
souverain
heaped
it
up
dexterously
and
blew
upon
what
remained
of
red
ashes
under
his
pile
whilst
a
kettle
was
placed
upon
the
glowing
embers
i
am
afraid
i
ca
offer
you
the
same
cheer
that
you
would
give
me
at
the
gilbert
said
to
his
friend
serait
g√¢ter
la
couleur
oh
some
with
a
bottle
of
beer
will
do
very
well
for
me
but
there
was
neither
bread
nor
cheese
nor
beer
and
no
kind
of
abode
however
miserable
had
souverain
ever
known
to
be
without
bread
what
do
they
live
upon
then
he
asked
porridge
and
they
occasionally
make
scones
was
the
reply
luckily
for
us
there
happened
to
be
an
ample
supply
of
them
freshly
made
and
with
these
boiled
eggs
and
fried
bacon
we
had
one
of
the
best
appreciated
meals
we
ever
tasted
it
was
followed
by
hot
and
cigars
for
the
gentlemen
by
tea
and
clotted
cream
for
the
ladies
and
for
a
while
we
quite
revived
but
sleep
would
have
its
way
and
there
being
only
two
beds
occupied
by
the
owners
of
the
inn
they
charitably
yielded
them
to
us
and
when
the
sheets
had
been
changed
aunt
mary
and
anne
shared
one
whilst
i
thankfully
retired
to
the
other
with
baby
the
gentlemen
remained
near
the
fire
in
the
one
of
them
stretched
on
the
sofa
and
the
other
using
its
cushions
as
a
mattress
on
the
following
morning
i
learned
the
meaning
of
the
word
smart
for
the
first
time
it
being
so
frequently
repeated
by
our
good
hostess
who
had
made
room
for
me
by
the
kitchen
fire
to
dress
my
child
how
smart
is
the
sweet
baby
she
constantly
exclaimed
with
honest
admiration
as
she
made
him
laugh
by
tickling
his
little
feet
or
chucking
his
chin
our
breakfast
was
a
repetition
of
the
supper
in
every
detail
and
our
enjoyment
of
it
more
limited
my
husband
soon
went
out
to
hire
a
boat
and
a
couple
of
men
to
row
us
back
again
they
took
us
first
to
ardhonnel
of
which
he
has
given
a
description
in
the
isles
of
loch
awe
a
gray
tall
fortress
on
a
wooded
isle
not
buried
but
adorned
by
foliage
the
day
was
fine
again
and
the
return
home
ideal
gilbert
steered
and
relieved
each
rower
in
turn
while
they
sang
their
scotch
melodies
with
voices
strong
and
clear
and
we
all
joined
in
the
chorus
when
we
reached
port
sonachan
we
heard
that
our
driver
had
only
arrived
towards
and
that
his
horses
not
being
strong
enough
to
stop
the
carriage
on
the
slope
to
the
ferry
had
fallen
into
the
lake
from
which
they
were
rescued
with
great
difficulty
we
saw
the
carriage
still
dripping
wet
which
had
been
left
out
to
dry
and
for
the
repairs
of
which
gilbert
later
on
received
a
bill
that
he
indignantly
refused
to
pay
this
romantic
excursion
as
souverain
called
it
had
so
much
developed
his
fancy
for
loch
awe
that
before
taking
leave
of
us
he
offered
to
go
halves
with
my
husband
in
the
purchase
of
innistrynich
but
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
as
the
lease
had
four
years
to
run
so
no
decision
was
taken
then
a
fortnight
after
the
departure
of
our
parisian
guest
aunt
mary
and
anne
left
us
regretfully
the
former
especially
who
was
going
back
reluctantly
to
the
jealous
remarks
of
her
sister
and
did
not
feel
disposed
to
listen
patiently
to
criticisms
on
her
nephew
character
and
conduct
or
on
mine
from
her
letters
afterwards
she
had
not
a
pleasant
time
of
it
but
relieved
the
painfulness
of
it
as
much
as
possible
by
accepting
at
intervals
several
invitations
from
her
friends
in
the
neighborhood
this
state
of
affairs
made
my
husband
very
miserable
for
he
would
have
done
anything
to
secure
his
aunt
mary
happiness
and
tranquillity
of
mind
and
to
help
him
in
his
endeavors
i
proposed
that
she
should
come
to
live
with
us
this
is
part
of
her
answer
i
hope
to
return
with
you
in
may
next
give
my
very
best
love
to
dear
eug√©nie
and
tell
her
that
i
thank
her
very
much
for
proposing
to
gratify
your
affection
to
me
by
proposing
that
i
should
live
with
her
and
you
but
susan
and
i
have
taken
each
other
for
better
and
worse
unless
some
deserving
person
of
the
other
sex
should
propose
and
the
one
he
proposes
to
say
yes
if
you
please
but
i
think
we
shall
never
separate
it
is
with
regret
that
i
have
to
recall
miss
susan
hamerton
unamiable
temper
at
that
time
one
thing
comes
in
mitigation
but
i
only
knew
of
it
years
afterwards
she
was
suffering
much
from
unavowed
nervousness
her
nephew
told
me
that
when
living
in
the
same
house
with
her
he
had
sometimes
noticed
that
she
ate
hardly
anything
and
looked
unwell
but
to
his
affectionate
inquiries
she
used
to
answer
my
health
is
good
enough
thank
you
and
i
know
what
you
imply
when
you
pretend
to
be
anxious
about
it
you
mean
that
i
am
cross
and
she
made
it
a
point
never
to
plead
guilty
to
any
physical
ailment
as
if
it
were
a
weakness
unworthy
of
her
and
also
to
discourage
all
attempts
at
sympathy
another
thing
i
learned
too
late
was
her
jealous
disposition
which
explained
her
attitude
towards
her
nephew
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
it
was
love
turned
sour
and
although
we
tried
to
discover
the
cause
of
her
bitterness
in
her
worldly
disappointment
we
became
convinced
that
she
would
have
felt
as
bitter
had
the
bride
been
wealthy
and
of
noble
lineage
because
her
jealousy
would
have
tortured
her
as
much
if
not
more
she
became
jealous
of
her
sister
when
we
invited
her
and
long
afterwards
when
her
brother
became
a
widower
and
she
went
to
live
with
him
he
confided
to
his
nephew
that
he
had
had
to
bear
frequent
outbursts
of
jealousy
it
was
merely
the
exaggeration
of
a
tender
sentiment
which
could
not
brook
a
rival

to

three

had
been

but
after
the

of

aunt

wrote
to
him
soon
after
i
am
so
very
glad
of
the
account
you
give
of
your
pictures
and
of
millais
opinion
of
them
it
is
very
encouraging
i
do
hope
truly
that
they
will
attract
gain
and
success
for
you
as
it
would
have
been
very
expensive

have
the
pictures
sent
to
and

hamerton
begged
a
friend
who
lived
in
london
to
keep
them
in
one
of
his
empty
rooms
he
had
a
whole
floor
unfurnished
till
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
them
for
a
private
exhibition
in
which
he
intended
to
give
lectures
on
artistic
subjects
the
mill
after
thorough
and
expensive
repairs
had
been
let
but
there
was
bad
news
from
the
tenant
of
the
who
refused
to
pay
the
rent
any
longer
under
pretext
that
the
mine
was
exhausted
this
looked
very
serious
as
after
referring
the
matter
to
his
uncle
who
was
a
solicitor
my
husband
learned
that
the
lease
made
during
his
minority
did
not
specify
the
quantity
of
coal
that
the
tenant
was
allowed
to
extract
from
the
mine
and
of
course
as
much
as
possible
had
been
taken
out
of
it
still
as
there
was
an
agreement
to
pay
the
rent
during
twelve
more
years
the
tenant
right
to
withdraw
from
the
signed
agreement
might
be
contested
and
the
affair
had
to
be
put
into
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
this
was
a
cause
of
great
anxiety
and
it
was
not
the
only
one
the
health
of
my
father
had
become
very
unsatisfactory
of
late
and
his
situation
was
no
longer
secure
he
had
been
on
most
excellent
terms
with
the
english
gentlemen
who
were
at
the
head
of
the
firm
in
which
he
was
cashier
but
they
were
retiring
from
business
and
my
father
did
not
know

was
coming

on
the
of

i
find
this
phrase
in
one
of
his
letters
ma

then
we
learned
that
a
project
for
lighting
bucharest
with
gas
was
on
foot
and
that
my
father
was
to
go
there
to
ascertain
the
chances
of
success
some
outlay
was
necessary
and
my
husband
who
had
heard
of
it
through
a
friend
generously
offered
to
defray
the
preliminary
expenses
his
offer
however
was
declined
for
the
time
there
being
as
yet
no
certainty
of
profit
early
in
gilbert
had
to
leave
innistrynich
to
visit
his
property
and
receive
the
rents
he
always
felt
reluctant
to
go
there
because
of
the
painful
reminiscences
of
his
early
youth
and
of
the
dreariness
of
the
scenery
there
was
also
another
reason
still
more
powerful
he
was
not
made
to
be
a
landlord
being
too
how
often
did
it
happen
that
instead
of
insisting
on
getting
his
rent
from
a
poor
operative
he
left
some
of
his
own
money
in
the
hand
of
wife
or
child
frequently
enough
in
hard
times
i
know
he
was
staying
at
the
jumps
and
went
from
there
to
shaw
burnley
and
manchester
he
never
missed
writing
to
me
every
day
either
a
short
note
or
a
long
letter
according
to
his
spare
time
in
one
of
them
he
says
ma

nous
ne

this
letter
contains
a
strong
proof
of
his
mind
artistic
evolution
in
the
course
of
the
summer
we
had
several
unexpected
visitors
among
them
and
mackay
pettie
the
artist
and
the
gentleman
described
in
the
painter
camp
as
gordon
who
frequently
called
sometimes
with
his
son
sometimes
alone
and
on
such
occasions
generally
remained
for
the
night
being
an
early
riser
and
indisposed
to
remain
idle
till
breakfast
time
he
was
found
in
the
morning
knitting
an
immense
woollen
stocking
which
he
afterwards
took
into
use
and
found
most
comfortable
wear
for
as
he
took
care
to
inform
me
we
had
once
another
visitor
who
had
come
to
paint
from
nature
and
was
staying
at
the
dalmally
inn
his
name
i
will
not
mention
on
account
of
a
little
adventure
which
made
him
so
miserable
that
he
left
our
house
breakfastless
rather
than
face
me
after
it
he
had
been
offered
a
bedroom
and
had
slept
soundly
till
about
five
in
the
morning
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
small
phrenological
bust
on
the
which
he
took
into
his
bed
with
the
intention
of
studying
it
at
leisure
as
he
lay
back
on
the
pillow
however
holding
up
the
bust
and
turning
it
sideways
to
read
the
indications
he
became
aware
of
a
black
dribble
rapidly
staining
the
sheets
and
counterpane
horrified
at
such
a
sight
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
discovered
too
late
that
he
had
totally
emptied
the
inkstand
about
the
same
time
we
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
acquainted
with
captain
clifton
and
his
wife
lady
bertha
clifton
who
had
rented
a
large
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
proved
very
friendly
neighbors
lady
bertha
was
extremely
handsome
her
voice
was
splendid
and
she
sang
readily
when
she
was
asked
our
neighbors
had
speculated
a
good
deal
about
her
probable
appearance
ways
and
disposition
and
the
news
that
a
in
her
own
was
coming
had
created
quite
a
commotion
i
asked
to
be
enlightened
on
so
important
a
subject
and
soon
heard
all
the
details
from
very
willing
lips
she
was
very
simple
in
dress
and
often
came
to
call
upon
us
in
a
fresh
gown
and
straw
hat
with
only
the
feather
of
a
heron
or
a
woodcock
in
it
her
husband
captain
clifton
retired
from
the
army
spoke
french
fairly
well
and
although
he
had
little
in
common
with
gilbert
being
an
enthusiastic
sportsman
soon
became
his
most
constant
visitor
both
of
them
liked
the
country
and
were
fond
of
boating
and
they
both
took
an
interest
in
politics
a
very
pleasant
feature
had
been
added
to
the
lake
by
the
appearance
of
a
small
steamer
belonging
to
a
proprietor
beyond
port
sonachan
who
came
with
his
wife
to
loch
awe
every
summer
they
invited
us
from
time
to
time
to
join
a
fishing
party
and
we
had
either
lunch
or
supper
on
board
there
was
a
cabin
for
shelter
and
the
ladies
being
thus
protected
against
the
almost
unavoidable
showers
readily
joined
the
in
this
summer
of
aunt
mary
came
with
our
cousin
jane
whose
sweet
disposition
and
charm
of
manner
greatly
disturbed
the
peace
of
mind
of
a
bachelor
visitor
a
distant
relation
of
my
husband
who
was
looking
about
for
a
shooting
everything
in
his
behavior
seemed
pointing
to
a
not
distant
offer
but
gilbert
who
was
already
a
good
judge
of
character
strongly
doubted
the
final
step
he
said
to
me
if
henry
is
too
sorely
tempted
he
will
run
away
rather
than
expose
his
wealth
to
the
perils
of
matrimony
he
does
not
spend
his
money
he
is
constantly
earning
more
and
accumulating
but
he
has
told
me
that
no
amount
of
conjugal
happiness
could
be
a
compensation
to
him
if
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
found
out
that
he
had
spent
a
thousand
pounds
more
than
what
he
was
accustomed
to
spend
regularly
and
it
happened
that
he
left
abruptly
just
as
my
husband
had
foretold
but
not
without
promising
a
future
commission
for
two
pictures
when
his
should
be
finished
the
love
of
boating
was
very
strong
in
gilbert
but
the
love
of
planning
new
boats
was
still
stronger
in
fact
he
always
had
in
a
portfolio
plans
more
or
less
advanced
for
some
kind
of
boat
and
he
very
often
made
models
with
his
own
hands
i
was
in
constant
fear
of
the
realization
of
these
plans
of
which
i
heard
a
great
deal
more
than
i
could
understand
he
was
well
aware
of
it
and
sometimes
stopped
short
to
say
with
a
smile
now
do
go
away
i
wo
bother
you
any
longer
with
boats
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
devising
improvements
even
when
he
resisted
that
of
testing
them
for
his
own
use
he
gave
the
benefit
of
his
thoughts
to
his
friends
when
they
seemed
likely
to
prove
useful
in
the
course
of
the
spring
however
he
had
been
at
work
planning
a
much
larger
boat
than
those
he
already
possessed
one
which
might
when
needful
carry
a
of
goods
across
the
bay
or
the
whole
camp
to
any
part
of
the
lake
i
offered
some
timid
remonstrances
about
the
probable
cost
but
he
met
them
by
affirming
that
it
would
be
an
economy
the
by
saving
labor
so
two
carpenters
were
fetched
from
greenock
and
began
to
work
under
his
direction
the
building
of
the
boat
which
of
course
took
more
time
than
had
been
expected
delayed
our
departure
for
france
but
at
last
we
set
off
to
introduce
our
to
his
relations
once
in
paris
hamerton
saw
a
great
deal
of
his
kind
friend
william
wyld
whose
advice
he
was
better
able
to
appreciate
now
that
his
ideas
about
art
were
no
longer
topographic
he
began
at
this
stage
of
artistic
culture
to
enjoy
composition
and
harmony
of
color
and
though
he
still
thought
that
his
friend
compositions
were
rather
too
obviously
artificial
he
did
not
remain
blind
to
their
merit
he
also
saw
more
of
alexandre
bixio
brother
of
the
celebrated
garibaldian
general
at
whose
house
he
met
renowned
artists
men
of
letters
and
politicians
alexandre
bixio
had
been
one
of
the
founders
of
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
with
bulwer
lytton
he
had
acted
as
of
the
assembl√©e
nationale
and
had
been
sent
to
the
court
of
victor
emmanuel
as
minister
plenipotentiary
and
was
an
intimate
friend
of
cavour
one
evening
after
dinner
at
his
house
he
took
hamerton
aside
and
pointing
to
a
young
man
engaged
in
an
animated
conversation
with
several
other
guests
he
said
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
that
is
not
a
future
minister
of
state
he
looks
very
young
answered
my
husband
very
much
astonished
he
is
young
he
was
born
in
but
remember
his
name
and
in
a
few
years
you
will
see
if
i
am
right
it
is
signor
sella
four
years
later
signor
sella
was
minister
of
finance
as
my
husband
has
told
in
his
autobiography
i
had
a
sister
younger
than
myself
by
seven
years
very
pretty
and
winning
about
whose
future
we
were
very
anxious
on
account
of
the
recurring
interruptions
in
her
studies
owing
to
my
mother
distressing
state
of
health
when
periods
of
illness
came
on
the
whole
duty
of
attendance
upon
her
devolved
on
my
sister
disastrous
as
such
breaks
in
her
education
might
prove
as
the
girl
grew
up
during
the
intervals
of
sickness
my
mother
yielded
to
our
entreaties
and
caroline
was
sent
to
school
but
as
a
she
often
missed
classes
for
one
reason
or
another
being
so
often
wanted
and
after
becoming
a
boarder
she
never
remained
in
the
same
institution
for
more
than
a
few
months
at
a
time
my
mother
kept
hoping
that
the
trouble
would
not
return
and
tried
to
persuade
us
that
now
studies
would
be
regular
and
that
being
very
intelligent
she
would
soon
be
on
a
par
with
girls
of
her
own
age
but
this
state
of
things
had
lasted
ever
since
i
was
married
and
i
could
not
foresee
the
end
of
it
we
often
talked
about
it
my
husband
and
myself
and
he
soon
guessed
that
i
wished
to
have
her
with
us
but
that
knowing
how
much
he
liked
having
our
home
to
ourselves
i
would
not
ask
him
to
bring
another
into
it
even
though
it
were
my
sister
he
was
however
with
his
usual
generosity
the
first
to
offer
it
aware
of
how
much
it
cost
him
i
accepted
nevertheless
for
we
were
both
of
one
mind
and
considered
it
as
a
duty
to
be
done
i
looked
upon
my
sister
as
my
child
for
my
mother
illness
had
begun
when
caroline
was
so
young
that
almost
all
motherly
cares
had
devolved
upon
me
who
was
the
eldest
we
kept
our
project
secret
to
the
last
not
to
disturb
the
family
peace
and
being
sure
of
my
father
acquiescence
and
of
caroline
delight
when
the
day
came
my
husband
persuasion
prevailed
and
my
sister
was
entrusted
to
our
care
this
time
while
staying
at
the
jumps
we
noticed
a
great
change
in
aunt
susan
behavior
towards
us
it
was
decidedly
friendly
with
now
and
then
an
almost
affectionate
touch
and
i
was
told
privately
that
she
had
thrown
out
hints
about
the
pleasure
that
an
invitation
to
innistrynich
would
give
her
so
the
invitation
was
given
before
we
left
my
husband
applied
to
caroline
teaching
the
system
which
had
proved
effective
with
me
and
made
her
read
english
aloud
to
him
whilst
he
was
painting
i
undertook
the
french
and
musical
part
of
her
education
and
her
progress
was
rapid
for
my
sake
gilbert
was
very
glad
that
i
had
caroline
with
me
because
in
the
course
of
that
year
he
camped
out
a
great
deal
and
it
had
become
impossible
for
me
to
accompany
him
another
little
boy
having
been
born
in
the
beginning
of
february
and
his
delicate
health
requiring
constant
care
our
pecuniary
troubles
were
increasing
the
american
war
having
broken
out
the
mill
which
had
been
repaired
at
great
cost
was
stopped
in
consequence
and
of
course
we
got
no
rent
either
from
it
or
from
the
cottages
whilst
the
expenses
of
the
little
farm
were
heavy
hay
being
at
an
extravagant
price
because
of
the
persistent
rains
which
in
the
previous
summer
had
rotted
all
the
cut
grass
and
made
it
necessary
to
bring
hay
from
england
although
we
kept
two
cows
our
supply
of
milk
and
cream
was
insufficient
and
my
husband
made
the
calculation
that
each
cow
consumed
daily
seven
shillings
worth
of
hay
in
this
spring
though
put
on
short
rations
in
fact
the
state
of
our
affairs
greatly
alarmed
us
for
we
did
not
see
any
prospect
of
speedy
earnings
and
we
began
to
think
of
a
total
change
in
our
way
of
living
which
would
materially
reduce
our
expenses
my
husband
would
have
been
inclined
to
remove
to
the
english
lake
district
but
remembered
in
time
that
it
was
nearly
as
wet
as
the
highlands
and
what
he
wanted
as
a
compensation
if
we
left
scotland
was
a
dry
climate
which
would
allow
much
more
time
for
work
it
so
happened
that
my
father
who
was
now
directeur
de
√†
gaz
at
beaucaire
had
suffered
in
health
catching
frequent
colds
through
having
to
get
out
of
bed
to
look
after
the
puddlers
to
stand
before
the
fires
whilst
they
were
replenished
and
to
cross
a
cold
draughty
courtyard
in
coming
back
he
had
never
complained
but
my
mother
thought
it
extremely
dangerous
and
wished
that
he
had
a
more
healthy
occupation
on
the
other
hand
i
had
diligently
applied
myself
to
our
small
farm
and
garden
with
the
help
of
a
most
valuable
and
simple
guide
la
maison
rustique
des
dames
by
madame
which
had
been
sent
to
me
as
a
present
by
bixio
and
i
had
often
thought
that
if
my
efforts
were
not
always
thwarted
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
i
might
count
upon
a
fair
return
all
this
led
me
to
fancy
that
if
we
were
to
buy
a
farm
in
france
it
might
prove
a
profitable
investment
and
i
talked
the
project
over
with
gilbert
this
is
the
conclusion
he
arrived
at
he
would
sell
his
property
rent
a
farm
in
france
which
i
should
manage
with
my
father
himself
remaining
entirely
faithful
to
his
artistic
and
literary
studies
if
my
mother
were
strong
enough
and
my
sister
willing
they
would
have
a
share
in
the
direction
and
even
my
brothers
later
on
if
it
were
to
their
taste
there
were
now
many
who
did
not
neglect
either
their
work
on
the
land
or
their
own
culture
and
madame
might
be
cited
as
examples
when
the
project
was
communicated
to
my
father
he
was
very
happy
at
the
idea
of
living
near
us
and
grateful
for
the
delicate
thoughtfulness
which
had
devised
this
means
of
coming
to
his
help
under
pretext
of
asking
help
from
him
here
is

of
his

my
father
had
been
offered
a
very
important
post
in
the
government
of
napoleon
on

of
accepting
his
policy

the

my
mother
and
my
brothers
also
wrote
warmly
and
gratefully
whilst
all
the
details
of
the
project
were
discussed
at
length
in
every
successive
letter
my
father
inclined
for
the
purchase
of
a
farm
but
gilbert
was
afraid
of
a
possible
confiscation
of
property
in
case
of
a
war
between
england
and
france
meanwhile
aunt
susan
had
entered
into
a
regular
and
friendly
correspondence
with
me
and
her
nephew
and
she
wrote
on
june
my
dear
niece
my
sister
and
myself
are
quite
annoyed
to
seem
so
dilatory
in
fixing
our
time
for
visiting
you
however
we
hope
to
be
with
you
on
saturday
the
sixth
of
july
i
hope
your
little
olive
branches
are
both
quite
well
and
also
your
sister
we
shall
be
glad
to
renew
and
make
fresh
acquaintance
amongst
the
young
ones
i
suppose
philip
gilbert
will
ere
this
be
returned
from
his
long
camping
expedition
and
i
hope
he
has
had
a
most
satisfactory
outing
will
you
all
accept
our
united
love
and
believe
me
your
affectionate
aunt
susan
hamerton
my
husband
was
at
home
to
receive
his
aunts
and
pleased
to
notice
how
amicably
we
got
on
together
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
took
place
shortly
before
their
departure
one
morning
i
was
gathering
strawberries
in
the
garden
and
it
was
slow
work
because
they
were
very
small
being
the
wild
species
which
had
been
transplanted
for
their
delicious
flavor
aunt
susan
came
up
and
offered
to
help
me
never
shall
i
forget
the
scene
when
we
both
rose
from
the
with
our
fragrant
little
baskets
well
filled
we
turned
towards
the
lake
whose
soft
hazy
glamour
matched
that
of
the
tender
sky
the
air
was
still
and
there
reigned
a
serene
silence
as
if
a
single
sound
might
have
desecrated
the
almost
religious
peace
of
earth
and
heaven
yet
a
smothered
sob
was
heard
as
i
felt
myself
caught
in
a
close
embrace
my
head
laid
upon
a
heaving
bosom
my
hair
moist
with
warm
tears
a
broken
voice
murmuring
my
child
how
i
have
wronged
you
and
i
love
you
so
oh
aunt
susan
i
said
do
cry
i
will
love
you
too
my
husband
will
be
so
happy
we
kissed
each
other
and
said
no
more
and
from
that
time
aunt
susan
became
my
most
faithful
friend
the
farm
project
having
been
seriously
considered
by
my
father
he
at
last
declared
it
too
hazardous
for
him
to
undertake
the
direction
of
it
from
the
first
he
had
felt
unequal
to
it
for
want
of
the
proper
knowledge
and
preparation
and
so
much
would
depend
upon
its
success
the
future
of
two
families
but
having
had
formerly
a
long
experience
in
the
wine
trade
and
being
a
particularly
reliable
authority
on
the
qualities
and
values
of
burgundy
wines
he
was
able
to
name
the
that
is
the
place
where
the
grapes
were
cultivated
of
any
wine
he
tasted
as
well
as
the
namely
the
year
in
which
it
had
been
made
and
having
been
in
his
youth
the
representative
of
an
important
wine
firm
in
burgundy
he
was
more
inclined
to
undertake
the
management
of
a
wine
business
than
anything
else
he
said
so
to
my
husband
adding
that
the
relatives
and
acquaintances
we
had
in
england
might
form
the
beginning
of
a
good
connection
and
that
his
own
name
as
head
of
the
firm
would
secure
a
good
many
customers
both
in
france
and
belgium
his
was
soon
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
these
reasons
and
it
was
decided
that
towards
the
end
of
the
year
we
would
go
to
france
to
choose
a
new
residence
suited
to
the
requirements
of
the
wine
business
and
situated
in
a
part
sufficiently
picturesque
to
lend
itself
to
artistic
representation
it
was
stipulated
that
the
name
of
hamerton
should
not
be
used
the
title
of
the
firm
was
to
be

can
stand
the
climate
of
the
highlands
without
suffering
from
it
it
is
so
damp
and
so
depressing
in
when
the
wind
howls
so
piteously
in
the
twisted
branches
of
the
scotch
firs
and
when
the

weeks
within
liquid

grayness
hamerton
since
he
came
to
innistrynich
had
repeatedly
suffered
from
what
he
believed
to
be
toothache
although
his
teeth
were
all
perfectly
sound
and
the
pain
being
always
attended
by
insomnia
was
a
cause
of
weakness
and
fatigue
detrimental
to
his
general
health
the
doctor
said
it
was
congestion
of
the
gums
due
to
the
excess
of
moisture
in
the
climate
which
had
not
been
favorable
to
either
of
us
for
i
had
also
discovered
that
my
hearing
was
becoming
impaired
and
these
were
weighty
additional
reasons
for
removing
elsewhere
i
had
been
somewhat
anxious
at
times
when
i
saw
him
fall
suddenly
into
a
state
of
listlessness
and
prostration
but
as
he
always
recovered
his
energy
and
resumed
his
usual
avocations
after
a
short
sleep
i
thought
it
must
be
the
result
of
temporary
exhaustion
for
which
nature
kindly
sent
the
best
remedy
restoring
sleep
and
as
he
had
told
me
he
had
always
experienced
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep
before
midnight
or
at
regular
hours
and
especially
in
getting
a
sufficiency
of
sleep
in
the
course
of
the
night
it
seemed
a
natural
compensation
for
the
system
that
an
occasional
nap
should
now
and
then
become
irrepressible
the
more
so
on
account
of
his
customary
nocturnal
rides
sails
or
walks
to
the
end
of
his
life
the
hours
of
the
night
seemed
to
him
quite
as
fit
for
any
sort
of
occupation
as
those
of
the
day
and
it
made
little
difference
to
him
whether
it
was
dark
or
light
indeed
at
one
time
years
later
when
at
he
began
to
the
stupefaction
of
his
country
neighbors
to
call
upon
them
at
nine
or
ten
in
the
summer
evenings
and
then
to
propose
a
row
on
the
pond
or
a
walk
by
moonlight
but
it
happened
not
unfrequently
that
he
could
get
no
admittance
rural
habits
having
sent
the
inhabitants
to
their
early
beds
or
else
if
they
were
still
found
in
a
state
of
wakefulness
they
did
not
evince
the
slightest
desire
to
be
out
with
a
and
even
hinted
that
it
might
look
objectionable
and
vagabondish
in
case
they
were
seen
he
was
greatly
astonished
at
this
new
point
of
view
for
it
was
merely
to
spare
the
working
hours
of
the
day
that
he
took
his
relaxation
in
the
night
a
good
many
more
pictures
had
been
painted
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
had
suggested
many
thoughts
about
art
which
had
been
duly
consigned
to
the
manuscript
of
the
painter
camp
aunt
mary
who
was
kept
wrote
how
can
you
dear
philip
gilbert
find
time
to
paint
so
much
and
to
write
so
much
it
was
now
necessary
to
be
more
industrious
than
ever
in
order
to
have
a
sufficient
number
of
works
to
cover
the
walls
of
the
exhibition
room
the
project
being
near
its
realization
and
matured
in
all
its
details
my
husband
was
to
take
me
our
children
and
caroline
to
my
parents
at
beaucaire
and
leave
us
there
while
he
went
in
search
of
a
house
then
back
again
to
the
highlands
for
the
removal
and
before
joining
me
again
he
was
to
organize
the
exhibition
in
london
with
the
help
of
thursday
and
leave
him
in
charge
of
it
about
the
middle
of
october
we
started
for
our
long
journey
southwards
with
mingled
feelings
of
deep
regret
for
what
we
left
behind
the
country
we
still
loved
so
much
the
associations
with
the
births
of
our
children
and
the
laborious
and
hopeful
beginnings
of
an
artistic
and
literary
career
as
well
as
the
tender
memories
of
the
growth
of
our
union
which
solitude
had
tested
and
strengthened
and
made
so
perfect
and
complete
then
if
we
looked
forward
it
was
with
joyful
feelings
for
the
lasting
reunion
of
the
family
for
the
peace
and
happiness
we
were
going
to
give
to
my
father
old
age
and
also
for
future
success
and
easier
circumstances
we
stopped
at
todmorden
to
say
farewell
to
our
relations
and
also
paid
farewell
visits
to
some
friends
amongst
them
butler
and
her
husband
hamerton
burnley
schoolmaster
to
handsley
for
whom
he
had
as
much
esteem
as
affection
and
to
his
abram
and
henry
milne
who
had
agreed
to
purchase
his
property
and
had
given
him
a
commission
for
the
two
pictures
already
spoken
of
at
loch
awe
and
destined
for
the
which
had
been
built
in
the
meantime
and
was
now
used
daily
on
arriving
at
beaucaire
we
found
my
mother
in
much
better
health
than
formerly
but
my
father
looked
aged
we
thought
however
he
was
much
cheered
by
our
prospects
and
entered
heartily
into
every
detail
concerning
them
my
husband
had
not
much
time
to
spare
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
together
we
saw
arles
n√Æmes
the
pont
du
gard
and
montmajour
and
called
upon
roumieu
the
proven√ßal
poet
to
whom
we
were
introduced
by
friends
we
used
to
roam
along
the
shores
of
the
rh√¥ne
in
the
twilight
the
noble
river
affording
us
a
perpetual
source
of
admiration
and
one
evening
when
we
were
bending
over
one
of
its
bridges
looking
at
the
swollen
and
tumultuous
waves
after
a
storm
we
became
spellbound
by
the
tones
of
a
superb
voice
coming
as
it
seemed
from
the
sky
and
singing
with
happy
ease
and
unconcern
one
after
the
other
some
of
the
most
difficult
parts
in
the
opera
of
william
tell
we
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
losing
a
few
notes
for
the
rich
full
voice
hardly
paused
between
two
songs
never
betraying
the
slightest
effort
or
fatigue
later
it
ceased
altogether
and
we
went
to
my
father
full
of
our
discovery
oh
it
villaret
of
the
brewery
yes
a
splendid
tenor
but
he
has
long
been
discovered
only
he
has
no
musical
education
and
his
relatives
wo
hear
of
his
going
on
the
stage
alexandre
dumas
after
listening
to
him
offered
to
pay
all
necessary
expenses
to
enable
him
to
attend
the
conservatoire
but
it
was
of
no
use
they
are
very
religious
in
the
family
and
have
an
insurmountable
horror
of
theatres
he
is
himself
a
very
simple
fellow
and
does
not
require
much
pressing
to
sing
whenever
he
is
asked
i
know
some
of
his
friends
and
the
lady
organist
of
the
church
particularly
and
if
you
wish
to
hear
him
at
her
house
i
dare
say
she
would
give
a
to
that
end
two
days
later
we
were
invited
by
the
lady
to
meet
him
and
with
evident
pleasure
but
without
vanity
he
sang
several
pieces
with
very
great
power
and
feeling
at
last
when
the
company
were
leaving
the
lady
of
the
house
took
gilbert
aside
to
beg
him
to
remain
a
little
longer
with
villaret
and
when
everybody
else
had
left
she
said
now
monsieur
villaret
i
count
upon
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
my
favorite
piece
in
muette
de
portici
i
am
going
to
play
the
accompaniment
i
would
if
i
could
to
oblige
you
he
answered
but
you
are
aware
of
my
weakness
i
never
can
do
justice
to
it
because
i
ca
master
my
emotion
never
mind
you
must
fancy
we
are
alone
together
hamerton
and
his
wife
will
remain
at
the
other
end
of
the
salon
behind
your
back
and
what
then
if
you
break
down
no
one
will
be
any
the
worse
for
it
she
sat
down
and
began
the
accompaniment
of
that
most
exquisitely
tender
song
de
ton
coeur
bannis
les
alarmes
songe
heureux
s√®che
les
larmes
qui
coulent
encore
de
tes
yeux
the
words
were
hardly
audible
but
we
were
so
moved
by
the
marvellous
purity
of
the
pathetic
voice
that
tears
stood
in
our
eyes
as
for
the
singer
tears
rolled
down
his
face
it
was
one
of
those
rare
and
perfect
pleasures
that
are
never
forgotten
a
few
years
later
villaret
made
his
as
first
tenor
at
the
op√©ra
in
paris
with
great
success
he
was
very
generous
with
tickets
to
his
early
friends
and
some
of
his
most
intolerant
relatives
had
died
and
he
had
yielded
at
last
to
the
general
wish
now
came
for
my
husband
and
myself
the
longest
separation
in
our
married
life
it
lasted
two
months
and
seemed
at
least
two
years
so
sad
and
wearied
did
we
grow
he
wrote
every
night
succinctly
what
had
been
done
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
sent
me
his
letters
three
times
a
week
when
beds
had
been
packed
up
or
sold
our
kind
neighbors
and
whitney
offered
him
hospitality
which
he
gratefully
accepted
till
everything
was
cleared
out
of
innistrynich
and
on
its
way
to
sens
in
the
department
of
the
yonne
where
our
new
residence
was
to
be
on
his
way
to
sens
gilbert
stayed
a
few
days
with
his
aunts
but
left
them
for
a
short
time
and
concluded
the
sale
of
his
property
to
henry
milne
it
was
but
a
poor
bargain
the
times
being
bad
for
the
cotton
district
on
account
of
the
american
war
but
he
had
no
alternative
having
engaged
to
find
capital
for
the
wine
business
and
even
needing
money
for
daily
expenses
for
as
yet
he
earned
nothing
what
he
had
been
in
dread
of
for
so
many
years
on
account
of
his
aunt
mary
state
of
health
happened
just
as
he
was
returning
to
the
jumps
and
when
he
saw
his
uncle
thomas
awaiting
him
at
the
station
he
had
a
foreboding
of
the
truth
aunt
mary
is
dead
not
dead
yet
but
unconscious
and
there
is
no
hope
this
morning
when
susan
was
in
the
waiting
for
her
sister
she
heard
a
stamping
overhead
followed
by
a
dull
heavy
thud
and
on
rushing
upstairs
found
mary
stretched
on
the
floor
and
moaning
but
unconscious
she
has
been
put
to
bed
and
attended
by
doctors
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
and
they
say
that
she
does
not
suffer
mournfully
my
husband
ascended
alone
in
the
dark
night
the
steep
hill
up
which
he
had
so
often
walked
gayly
to
see
his
beloved
guardian
tenderly
he
watched
at
her
bedside
for
hours
till
she
breathed
no
more
and
at
last
reverently
accompanied
her
remains
to
the
chosen
place
which
he
never
omitted
to
visit
afterwards
every
time
he
came
to
todmorden
he
wrote
to
say
what
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
think
that
his
aunt
had
seen
him
only
a
few
hours
before
the
attack
and
when
it
came
she
must
have
felt
him
so
near
to
her
i
remember
an
incident
which
took
place
on
the
day
we
took
leave
of
aunt
mary
to
go
to
innistrynich
she
had
invited
two
of
her
nieces
to
lunch
with
us
at
the
jumps
when
we
left
the
house
some
time
in
the
afternoon
i
went
first
with
my
cousins
leaving
nephew
and
aunt
together
for
more
intimate
communing
and
when
my
husband
reached
us
his
eyes
were
still
moist
and
his
voice
tremulous
the
girls
thoughtlessly
teased
him
about
it
and
twitted
him
with
his
weakness
but
he
did
not
allow
them
to
amuse
themselves
long
he
cowed
them
with
a
violence
of
contempt
which
terrified
me
whilst
i
could
not
help
admiring
it
yes
he
said
i
have
shed
tears
not
unmanly
tears
and
if
you
are
not
capable
of
entering
into
the
feelings
of
grateful
love
and
regret
which
wring
these
tears
out
of
my
heart
i
despise
you
for
your
heartlessness
his
voice
had
recovered
its
firmness
and
rang
loud
his
eyes
shot
flames
he
looked
more
than
human
these
startling
outbursts
of
generous
or
honest
passion
were
one
of
his
most
marked
characteristics
they
occurred
but
rarely
but
when
they
did
occur
nothing
could
abate
their
terrific
violence
a
single
word
in
mitigation
would
have
acted
like
oil
on
the
flames
it
must
be
explained
that
they
were
always
justified
by
the
cause
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
admire
such
genuine
and
resentment
against
meanness
or
dishonesty
or
in
some
cases
against
what
he
considered
insulting
to
his
sense
of
honor
for
instance
on
one
occasion
a
very
important
sale
of
works
of
art
was
to
take
place
abroad
and
he
was
asked
to
contribute
some
notes
to
the
catalogue
it
was
hinted
clearly
enough
that
any
words
of
praise
would
be
handsomely
acknowledged
he
resented
the
offer
like
a
blow
on
the
face
blushed
crimson
with
ardent
indignation
and
almost
staggered
to
the
there
he
seized
a
postcard
and
in
large
clear
letters
threw
back
the
insult
with
cutting
contempt
the
sense
of
having
cleared
his
honor
somewhat
relieved
him
and
after
waiting
for
a
propitious
moment
i
tried
to
persuade
him
before
the
card
was
posted
that
the
offence
was
not
so
heinous
as
it
looked
the
writer
not
knowing
him
personally
and
merely
imagining
himself
to
be
acting
in
conformity
with
a
prevalent
custom
which
some
critics
were
far
from
resenting
all
i
could
obtain
however
was
an
envelope
for
the
terrible
postcard
now
to
resume
the
narrative
i
left
beaucaire
to
join
my
husband
at
havre
on
his
return
and
after
visiting
the
town
together
we
hastened
to
our
new
house
at
sens
which
i
longed
to
see
for
it
had
been
chosen
in
my
absence
and
though
i
had
received
minute
descriptions
of
it
i
was
not
able
to
realize
its
appearance
or
surroundings
it
was
one
of
the
large
roomy
so
numerous
in
french
provincial
towns
at
that
time
built
for
the
convenience
of
the
owner
and
not
in
order
to
be
let
as
an
investment
it
was
perfectly
suitable
for
the
double
purpose
gilbert
had
in
view
with
a
spacious
carriage
entrance
courtyard
cellars
barns
and
stable
for
the
wine
trade
and
large
commodious
rooms
for
residence
but
to
my
regret
there
was
no
garden
a
great
privation
for
me
however
my
husband
told
me
that
our
landlord
had
promised
to
make
one
if
i
cared
so
much
for
it
i
did
care
very
much
as
the
only
view
from
the
house
was
that
of
other
houses
and
walls
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
but
when
asked
to
fulfil
his
promise
the
landlord
said
it
was
a
misunderstanding
he
had
merely
given
leave
for
to
make
a
garden
in
the
courtyard
if
we
liked
or
else
he
would
let
us
have
one
for
a
moderate
rent
outside
of
the
town
a
common
habit
at
sens
however
as
i
did
not
appreciate
the
pleasure
of
an
hour
walk
every
time
i
wished
to
smell
a
flower
in
my
garden
we
declined
the
offer
and
my
husband
kindly
planned
a
narrow
all
along
the
base
of
the
walls
in
the
courtyard
which
looked
gay
enough
when
the
plants
were
in
full
bloom
and
the
walls
were
hidden
by
convolvulus
nasturtiums
and
virginia
creepers
even
before
the
house
was
furnished
and
in
order
gilbert
was
eager
to
begin
his
commission
pictures
but
he
soon
found
that
even
our
large
rooms
were
too
small
for
a
studio
and
the
light
was
not
good
for
painting
but
at
the
same
time
i
believe
he
was
not
sorry
because
it
gave
him
a
plausible
excuse
for
turning
one
of
the
barns
into
a
capital
studio
this
outbuilding
offered
great
and
tempting
advantages
it
was
isolated
from
the
house
therefore
silent
and
private
it
might
be
lighted
from
the
north
and
was
sufficiently
spacious
to
allow
a
part
to
be
divided
off
for
a
laboratory
being
greatly
interested
in
architecture
and
building
my
husband
derived
great
pleasure
from
the
execution
of
his
own
plans
even
in
such
a
small
matter
i
vainly
attempted
to
reconcile
him
to
the
idea
of
using
one
of
the
large
rooms
standing
in
fear
of
the
expense
but
i
could
not
help
admitting
that
with
his
propensity
for
large
canvases
which
i
deprecated
all
my
life
a
studio
was
indispensable
and
after
all
as
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
we
should
stay
there
a
great
many
years
it
was
not
of
much
importance
especially
after
having
lived
in
terror
of
seeing
him
undertake
the
building
of
a
tower
or
the
restoration
of
an
old
castle
like
kilchurn
a
dream
that
he
often
indulged
as
numerous
designs
bore
testimony
the
first
thing
considered
by
gilbert
when
he
settled
at
sens
was
the
choice
of
subjects
for
his
commission
pictures
which
he
intended
to
paint
directly
from
nature
and
he
soon
selected
panoramic
landscape
views
from
the
top
of
a
small
hill
called
bon
which
commands
an
extensive
prospect
of
the
river
yonne
and
of
the
plains
about
it
on
the
summit
of
this
eminence
there
is
a
kiosk
belonging
to
the
archbishop
who
readily
granted
the
use
of
it
to
the
artist
for
sheltering
his
pictures
brushes
colors
etc
but
the
artist
was
not
one
who
could
bear
confinement
and
the
kiosk
was
but
a
tiny
affair
and
not
movable
so
two
of
the
tents
were
set
up
at
its
foot
and
formed
a
painter
camp
which
attracted
so
many
curious
visitors
that
it
was
thought
unsafe
to
leave
it
at
their
mercy
and
when
gilbert
went
back
home
for
the
night
a
watchman
well
armed
with
pistols
and
a
gun
took
his
place
every
day
when
the
great
summer
heat
had
abated
i
used
to
set
off
with
the
children
to
go
and
meet
my
husband
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
we
returned
together
to
the
house
attempting
on
the
way
to
make
the
boys
speak
english
but
without
success
for
the
eldest
who
spoke
but
english
when
i
had
left
him
two
months
before
at
beaucaire
now
chose
to
gabble
in
proven√ßal
which
he
had
picked
up
from
his
nurse
regardless
of
his
aunt
caroline
efforts
to
make
him
talk
in
his
native
tongue
subsequently
when
he
perceived
that
no
one
understood
him
he
quickly
dropped
his
proven√ßal
and
replaced
it
by
french
but
would
not
trouble
himself
to
speak
two
different
languages
together
by
the
care
and
thoughtfulness
of
gilbert
a
pretty
little
house
and
garden
had
been
prepared
for
his
and
family
at
a
short
distance
from
our
own
dwelling
where
the
office
of
the
business
was
now
ready
on
the
completely
fitted
up
and
separated
from
the
private
dwelling
my
mother
had
come
first
with
my
brothers
and
sister
whilst
my
father
remained
a
little
longer
to
put
his
successor
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
delay
was
longer
than
we
had
foreseen
and
i
began
to
grow
anxious
on
account
of
my
letters
remaining
unanswered
then
i
was
told
that
my
father
was
very
busy
not
very
well
and
that
he
could
not
write
about
a
month
later
he
wrote
that
he
was
now
well
enough
to
undertake
the
journey
and
with
great
rejoicings
we
prepared
to
receive
him
but
when
i
noticed
how
altered
he
was
how
thin
how
weak
all
my
joy
forsook
me
and
it
was
almost
beyond
my
power
not
to
let
him
read
it
in
my
face
courageous
as
ever
he
tried
to
be
and
to
happy
and
talked
of
setting
to
work
immediately
i
learned
now
that
he
had
been
dangerously
ill
but
that
his
malady
had
been
kept
secret
to
spare
me
a
few
trying
months
followed
during
which
we
passed
alternately
from
hope
to
fear
the
most
distressing
feature
of
this
sorrowful
time
being
my
poor
father
desperate
struggle
for
life
i
must
and
i
will
live
to
work
it
is
my
duty
to
get
well
i
have
a
heavy
debt
and
responsibility
now
that
you
are
involved
in
this
business
he
used
to
say
to
his
he
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
his
friend
alphonse
gu√©rin
the
celebrated
discoverer
of
the
antiseptic
method
of
dressing
wounds
and
thought
that
if
any
one
could
cure
him
it
was
gu√©rin
who
had
prescribed
for
him
throughout
his
life
in
paris
accordingly
to
paris
he
went
and
died
there
shortly
after
notwithstanding
the
devoted
care
of
his
doctor
everything
seemed
to
turn
against
my
husband
wisest
plans
but
nothing
daunted
by
this
last
fearful
blow
he
at
once
offered
his
a
pension
sufficient
to
enable
her
children
to
carry
on
their
education
this
pension
would
gradually
be
diminished
as
the
children
became
able
to
earn
money
for
themselves
and
to
take
their
share
in
the
maintenance
of
their
mother
the
fact
was
that
from
that
time
he
had
two
families
to
keep
besides
the
studies
at
bon
he
had
begun
two
pictures
of
large
dimensions
in
his
studio
and
worked
at
them
steadily
as
he
could
not
sit
down
this
excess
of
fatigue
brought
on
a
very
serious
illness
which
kept
him
in
bed
for
nearly
a
fortnight
and
it
was
the
only
instance
of
his
submission
to
such
an
order
from
a
physician
during
the
whole
course
of
our
married
life
but
it
was
rendered
imperative
by
the
nature
of
the
disorder
he
hated
remaining
in
bed
when
awake
at
all
times
and
he
could
not
stand
it
at
all
in
the
hours
of
day
later
on
he
had
the
measles
and
still
later
he
suffered
from
gout
but
he
would
not
stay
in
bed
in
either
case
and
during
the
first
attack
of
gout
which
was
as
severe
as
unexpected
he
remained
for
nights
without
going
to
bed
this
illness
prevented
him
from
attending
the
marriage
of
his
eldest
cousin
anne
hamerton
about
which
her
sister
wrote
on
july
that
it
was
to
take
place
on
august
and
after
giving
a
good
many
details
she
observed
you
may
be
above
such
vanities
but
i
think
eug√©nie
may
be
a
little
interested
poor
eug√©nie
how
anxious
she
must
have
been
having
you
in
your
room
so
long
how
are
your
pictures
progressing
it
must
decidedly
be
a
punishment
to
you
to
be
limited
to
time
at
your
easel
particularly
now
when
you
must
feel
so
wishful
to
get
on
with
your
commissions
after
his
recovery
my
husband
arranged
his
work
in
a
manner
which
divided
the
hours
into
sitting
ones
and
standing
ones
to
avoid
a
return
of
the
late
inflammatory
symptoms
and
there
never
was
a
recurrence
of
them
the
pictures
were
in
a
fairly
advanced
stage
when
william
wyld
came
on
a
visit
of
a
few
days
and
gave
him
valuable
advice
about
them
his
aunt
susan
said
in
a
subsequent
letter
i
am
very
glad
wyld
has
been
to
see
your
pictures
and
though
you
may
be
a
little
dissatisfied
that
your
present
works
will
be
cheap
still
the
cheering
opinion
of
them
will
give
you
great
courage
i
hope
i
shall
certainly
go
to
see
them
as
soon
as
they
get
to
agnew
so
much
for
the
art
department
for
the
literary
one
the
camp
had
been
accepted
by
macmillan
and
we
were
in
a
fever
of
excitement
awaiting
its
publication
as
to
the
wine
business
after
remaining
irresolute
for
some
time
gilbert
had
accepted
the
proposition
of
a
friend
to
assume
what
should
have
been
my
father
part
with
this
alteration
however
that
he
would
pay
interest
on
the
funds
confided
to
him
and
share
the
clear
profits
with
the
sleeping
partner
this
episode
in
my
husband
life
was
so
bitter
and
involved
him
in
such
difficulties
that
i
will
cut
it
short
suffice
it
to
say
that
though
the
partnership
was
continued
for
a
few
years
during
which
the
interest
of
the
money
came
but
irregularly
the
capital
was
entirely
and
irremediably
lost
in
the
end
when
autumn
came
the
commission
pictures
were
sent
to
manchester
for
exhibition
and
shortly
after
milne
declined
to
accept
them
on
the
plea
that
he
did
not
care
for
the
subjects
the
real
reason
being
that
his
sensitive
heart
had
been
again
impressed
this
time
by
a
young
governess
of
whom
he
had
bought
two
copies
after
greuze
which
were
now
occupying
the
place
formerly
destined
for
his
cousin
works
however
another
friend
soon
became
their
purchaser
but
for
the
artist
the
disappointment
remained
sadness
for
the
loss
of
his
aunt
thomas
hamerton
which
happened
just
at
that
time
and
sympathy
with
his
uncle
in
these
trying
moments
spoilt
the
pleasure
gilbert
had
anticipated
from
the
visit
to
his
relations
which
we
made
that
year
we
were
to
go
back
to
france
with
return
tickets
and
the
time
allowed
being
nearly
over
we
went
to
take
leave
of
our
friends
at
west
lodge
when
we
learned
that
hamerton
who
had
lately
been
suffering
from
an
attack
of
gout
had
succumbed
to
its
weakening
effects
regardless
of
the
pecuniary
loss
my
husband
immediately
expressed
his
determination
to
stay
as
long
as
he
could
be
of
any
help
to
his
uncle
we
therefore
sacrificed
our
tickets
and
went
back
to
the
jumps
whence
he
came
down
every
day
to
spare
his
uncle
all
the
painful
formalities
of
a
funeral
we
only
left
when
the
run
of
ordinary
habits
had
been
at
west
lodge
but
even
then
we
felt
that
a
new
misfortune
was
lurking
in
the
silent
house
for
the
health
of
jane
hamerton
who
had
never
been
very
strong
now
began
to
disquiet
her
friends
particularly
my
husband
whose
affection
for
her
was
very
true
and
tender
aunt
susan
who
was
her
devoted
but
nurse
wrote
to
us
in
the
course
of
the
summer
that
her
case
was
very
serious
notwithstanding
the
short
periods
of
improvement
occurring
at
intervals
the
poor
girl
had
grown
very
weak
and
lost
her
appetite
almost
constantly
feverish
she
longed
for
fruit
to
refresh
her
parched
mouth
and
quench
her
thirst
as
soon
as
he
became
aware
of
this
longing
gilbert
began
to
plan
how
he
might
gratify
it
and
it
appeared
easy
enough
as
we
were
in
a
land
of
plenty
but
the
time
required
for
the
transport
of
such
delicacies
as
grapes
and
peaches
threatened
ominously
their
safe
arrival
however
we
would
run
the
risk
to
give
a
little
relief
to
our
dear
invalid
and
we
would
take
the
greatest
precautions
in
the
packing
so
we
went
to
a
taking
with
us
a
large
box
filled
with
dry
bran
and
divided
into
compartments
one
was
filled
with
melons
another
with
grapes
the
last
with
peaches
every
one
taken
from
the
tree
vine
or
plant
with
our
own
hands
then
wrapped
in
and
protected
all
round
with
bran
the
result
will
be
seen
in
the
following
letter
from
jane
my
dear
eugenie
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
enormous
box
of
fruit
which
arrived
here
about
noon
it
is
quite
a
to
the
inhabitants
of
west
lodge
more
especially
to
me
i
am
very
happy
to
tell
you
that
the
grapes
have
arrived
in
perfect
condition
and
that
the
melons
seem
to
have
suffered
only
outwardly
as
the
one
cut
into
is
quite
luscious
and
good
the
sausage
de
also
appears
to
have
borne
the
journey
well
but
has
not
yet
been
tasted
so
the
next
letter
from
todmorden
must
give
the
opinion
upon
it
but
it
certainly
looks
to
me
a
most
comical
affair
and
to
tell
last
the
only
disagreeable
thing
it
is
about
the
peaches
which
were
all
in
a
dreadful
mess
and
quite
mixed
up
with
the
bran
and
scarcely
fit
to
touch
though
aunt
susan
did
take
out
one
or
two
to
see
the
extent
of
the
decay
how
very
provoking
for
you
both
when
you
heard
of
the
detention
at
havre
particularly
when
had
taken
such
precautions
with
regard
to
the
outside
directions
if
i
have
given
such
apparently
trivial
details
at
length
it
was
to
show
how
generous
of
his
time
and
thought
was
my
husband
in
everything
concerning
affection
or
pity
his
sympathy
was
always
ready
and
active
and
he
never
begrudged
his
exertions
to
give
relief
or
comfort
to
those
in
need
of
either
it
had
been
most
fortunate
for
the
young
author
of
the
painter
camp
in
the
highlands
that
the
of
the
book
happened
to
come
under
the
eyes
of
macmillan
himself
who
being
in
want
of
rest
and
attracted
by
the
title
had
taken
it
with
him
in
the
country
and
had
read
it
with
great
delight
being
a
scotchman
he
was
in
immediate
sympathy
with
so
fervent
an
admirer
of
the
highlands
as
my
husband
and
had
at
once
agreed
to
publish
the
book
from
the
first
it
was
a
success
the
freshness
of
the
narrative
the
novelty
of
the
subject
the
truthfulness
and
charm
of
the
descriptions
were
duly
appreciated
together
with
the
earnest
if
still
immature
expressions
of
the
thoughts
about
art
the
book
soon
found
its
way
to
america
where
it
attracted
the
notice
of
roberts
brothers
publishing
house
they
were
charmed
with
it
and
published
an
edition
in
america
the
painter
camp
was
well
received
by
the
press
of
both
nations
and
the
reviews
were
numerous
it
was
compared
to
robinson
crusoe
and
called
unique
the
author
was
very
much
amused
to
hear
that
punch
had
given
an
illustrated
notice
of
it
under
the
title
of
a
painter
scamp
in
the
highlands
this
success
almost
unexpected
led
my
husband
to
accept
proposals
for
other
literary
productions
the
most
important
at
that
time
being
contributed
to
the
fine
arts
quarterly
review
and
beginning
with
an
elaborate
criticism
of
the
salon
of
he
also
began
to
write
for
the
cornhill
and
macmillan
magazine
much
against
his
wish
merely
because
painting
was
a
source
of
expense
without
a
return
although
my
husband
had
himself
chosen
sens
for
his
residence
his
choice
had
been
dictated
by
necessity
to
a
great
extent
rather
than
by
preference
it
was
a
combination
of
conveniences
for
different
purposes
but
the
kind
of
scenery
was
so
far
from
giving
entire
satisfaction
to
his
artistic
tastes
that
he
began
to
suffer
seriously
from
mountain
nostalgia
he
admired
the
river
and
had
upon
it
a
lovely
bought
of
the
best
at
asni√®res
and
he
used
it
often
but
without
finding
river
landscape
a
compensation
for
mountain
scenery
in
fear
of
a
serious
illness
we
thought
it
better
to
gratify
the
longing
and
devised
a
plan
for
a
journey
to
switzerland
which
would
greatly
reduce
the
expense
without
spoiling
the
pleasure
it
was
this
the
new
line
of
railway
from
neufch√¢tel
to
pontarlier
had
just
been
opened
and
passed
through
the
most
beautiful
scenery
gilbert
offered
the
company
an
article
in
an
english
paper
in
return
for
two
travelling
tickets
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
the
offer
was
accepted
it
was
a
charming
holiday
we
stayed
a
few
days
at
neufch√¢tel
with
friends
and
visited
at
our
leisure
geneva
lausanne
lucerne
b√¢le
and
berne
and
after
feasting
his
eyes
on
mont
pilatus
the
jungfrau
and
mont
blanc
my
husband
came
back
cured
he
had
sometimes
spoken
of
the
possibility
of
a
removal
to
geneva
before
we
had
been
there
on
account
of
the
lake
and
mont
blanc
but
i
objected
that
we
did
not
know
the
place
to
this
objection
he
had
a
very
characteristic
answer
do
know
the
place
but
i
know
it
as
well
as
if
i
had
dwelt
there
after
reading
so
many
descriptions
of
it
and
being
aware
of
its
geographical
situation
when
i
remarked
that
it
was
quite
different
from
what
i
had
anticipated
he
said
it
is
exactly
what
i
had
imagined
he
often
used
to
tell
us
that
he
had
no
need
of
going
to
rome
or
vienna
or
to
any
other
celebrated
town
to
know
its
general
aspect
for
he
had
studied
their
monuments
in
detail
the
prevailing
character
of
their
architecture
that
of
the
inhabitants
with
their
costumes
and
manners
and
he
was
even
acquainted
with
the
names
and
directions
of
the
principal
streets
at
the
end
of
the
year
our
sweet
cousin
jane
died
with
great
resignation
thankful
to
be
delivered
from
her
long
wearying
consumptive
pains
aunt
susan
had
volunteered
to
be
her
from
the
month
of
june
in
order
to
move
her
gently
and
to
support
the
poor
wasted
frame
upon
her
own
to
relieve
the
by
a
change
of
posture
her
devotion
had
been
indefatigable
and
unrelieved
for
her
invalid
niece
would
accept
attendance
from
no
one
else
this
loss
was
keenly
felt
by
my
husband
whose
little
playfellow
she
had
been
the
threatening
symptoms
of
the
disease
had
prevented
her
coming
to
us
together
with
her
father
and
aunt
as
it
was
proposed
they
should
do
in
the
summer
and
now
grief
did
not
allow
her
bereaved
relatives
to
entertain
the
idea
of
a
change
it
is
likely
enough
that
the
series
of
sorrows
and
disappointments
we
had
experienced
since
we
came
to
sens
prevented
our
growing
attached
to
the
place
it
may
be
also
that
our
roomy
but
thoroughly
commonplace
house
being
one
of
a
row
in
a
street
devoid
of
interest
never
answered
in
the
least
to
our
need
of
poetry
or
even
of
privacy
particularly
with
our
minds
and
hearts
still
full
of
dear
innistrynich
but
certain
it
is
that
we
did
not
feel
the
slightest
regret
at
the
idea
of
leaving
it
forever
nay
we
even
longed
to
be
away
from
it
this
feeling
was
common
to
both
of
us
yet
we
both
refrained
from
mentioning
it
to
each
other
for
some
time
thinking
it
unreasonable
till
we
came
to
discuss
it
together
and
to
agree
that
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
exchange
a
house
too
large
for
our
wants
for
a
smaller
one
at
a
lower
rent
and
a
town
life
that
neither
of
us
enjoyed
for
a
simpler
mode
of
living
in
some
picturesque
more
suitable
for
my
husband
artistic
taste
it
must
be
explained
that
our
partner
had
decided
to
take
a
house
in
the
very
heart
of
burgundy
to
carry
on
the
business
on
the
plea
that
the
name
of
the
renowned
vineyards
surrounding
it
being
on
the
address
were
likely
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
customers
he
added
that
the
situation
would
also
be
more
favorable
for
his
purchases
sales
and
business
journeys
and
of
course
being
the
only
working
partner
he
acted
as
he
liked
then
what
was
the
use
now
of
those
empty
cellars
dreary
paved
courtyard
and
formal
office
we
had
no
pleasant
associations
there
having
made
no
friends
on
account
of
our
mourning
why
should
we
remain
against
our
inclination
we
decided
to
remove
as
soon
as
we
had
discovered
something
for
which
we
might
form
a
real
liking
and
the
result
of
our
experience
has
been
given
at
length
by
hamerton
in
round
my
house
to
which
i
refer
the
reader
for
details
which
could
not
find
place
in
the
following
brief
account
of
our
search
it
was
begun
on
the
shores
of
the
rh√¥ne
whose
noble
landscape
my
husband
so
much
admired
but
although
the
scenery
was
very
tempting
to
an
artist
was
not
the
only
condition
to
be
considered
and
we
were
soon
discouraged
by
the
prevailing
dirtiness
and
slovenliness
of
the
people
and
by
what
we
heard
of
the
disastrous
inundations
we
were
also
afraid
of
our
children
catching
the
horrid
accent
of
the
country
so
we
thought
of
the
sa√¥ne
district
gilbert
being
unable
to
bear
the
idea
of
being
at
a
remote
distance
from
an
expanse
of
water
of
some
kind
here
again
the
landscape
was
appreciated
though
for
charms
different
from
those
of
the
rh√¥ne
unluckily
we
could
not
find
a
suitable
house
in
a
good
situation
and
we
also
learned
that
intermittent
fevers
were
very
prevalent
on
account
of
the
periodical
overflows
of
the
sa√¥ne
we
tried
after
that
the
of
burgundy
where
gilbert
told
me
what
he
has
repeated
in
round
my
house
there
is
no
water
with
its
pleasant
life
and
changefulness
here
i
also
agreed
with
him
in
thinking
the
renowned
vineyards
of
the
c√¥te
most
monotonous
except
during
a
very
short
time
indeed
when
they
are
clothed
in
the
splendor
of
gold
and
purple
just
before
a
cruel
night
of
frost
strips
them
bare
and
only
leaves
the
blackened
visible
for
more
than
six
months
at
a
time
then
we
turned
to
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
doubs
and
discovered
the
very
dwelling
of
our
dreams
in
which
were
found
all
the
conditions
that
we
thought
desirable
however
we
were
doomed
to
a
new
disappointment
for
the
owner
when
we
offered
to
take
it
changed
her
mind
and
coolly
declined
to
let
fortunately
some
time
later
a
friend
directed
us
to
quite
another
region
that
of
the
autunois
to
see
a
very
similar
house
offering
about
the
same
advantages
there
were
a
few
points
of
difference
for
instance
the
little
river
encircling
the
garden
was
only
a
instead
of
the
broad
and
placid
doubs
the
building
was
also
of
more
modest
appearance
as
compensations
however
there
were
picturesque
and
extensive
views
from
every
window
the
situation
was
more
private
and
the
solitude
of
the
small
wild
park
with
its
beautiful
trees
at
once
enchanted
gilbert
so
we
decided
to
take
chapter
viii
canoeing
on
the
visit
of
tour
in
experiments
in
the
saturday
review
journeys
to
plan
of
etching
and
etchers
new
friends
in
london
etchings
exhibited
at
the
royal
serious
illness
in
george
professor
seeley
not
to
waste
his
time
in
the
work
of
removal
and
fitting
up
hamerton
remained
behind
at
sens
to
finish
the
copying
of
a
window
by
jean
cousin
in
the
cathedral
and
some
other
drawings
begun
to
illustrate
an
article
on
this
artist
we
had
all
gone
forward
to
and
when
he
arrived
there
everything
being
already
in
order
he
continued
his
work
without
interruption
he
was
delighted
with
the
unpretentious
little
house
and
with
its
views
from
every
window
with
the
silent
shady
wild
garden
and
its
group
of
tall
poplars
by
the
clear
cool
winding
river
which
divided
it
from
the
pastures
on
the
other
side
and
he
often
repeated
to
us
with
a
smile
charme
moi
although
the
house
was
small
there
were
a
good
many
rooms
in
it
and
the
master
had
for
himself
alone
a
studio
an
room
a
study
and
a
carpenter
shop
for
he
was
fond
of
carpentry
in
his
leisure
hours
and
far
from
unskilful
he
liked
to
make
experimental
boats
with
his
own
hands
and
moreover
he
found
out
that
some
kind
of
physical
exercise
was
necessary
to
him
as
a
relief
from
for
if
the
weather
was
bad
and
he
took
no
exercise
he
began
to
feel
liable
to
a
sort
of
uncomfortable
giddiness
i
wished
him
to
consult
a
doctor
about
it
but
he
believed
that
it
would
go
away
after
a
while
for
it
had
come
on
quite
lately
while
painting
on
an
open
scaffolding
inside
the
cathedral
at
sens
when
he
could
see
through
the
planks
and
all
round
far
below
him
and
this
had
produced
at
times
a
kind
of
vertigo
the
pretty
little
boat
bought
at
asni√®res
was
all
very
well
for
the
arroux
which
flows
by
autun
but
for
the
narrow
shallow
winding
ternin
and
the
vesure
some
other
kind
of
craft
had
to
be
devised
and
paper
boats
were
built
upon
skeletons
and
tried
with
more
or
less
success
my
eldest
brother
charles
who
had
finished
his
classical
studies
and
was
now
preparing
to
become
an
architect
used
to
come
from
m√¢con
for
the
holidays
sometimes
bringing
a
friend
with
him
and
together
with
gilbert
they
went
exploring
the
unknown
rivers
they
generally
came
home
dripping
wet
having
abandoned
their
canoes
in
the
entanglement
of
roots
and
weeds
after
a
sudden
upset
and
having
to
go
and
fetch
them
back
with
a
cart
unless
the
shipwreck
was
caused
by
an
unsuspected
branch
under
water
or
by
the
swift
rush
of
a
current
catching
the
frail
concern
and
carrying
it
away
altogether
whilst
the
venturesome
navigator
was
gathering
his
wits
on
the
pebbles
of
the
towards
the
end
of
august
thomas
hamerton
and
his
sister
susan
came
to
visit
us
they
liked
the
autunois
at
least
what
they
saw
of
it
exceedingly
but
they
suffered
much
from
the
heat
particularly
our
uncle
who
had
remained
true
to
his
youthful
style
of
dress
high
collar
sawing
the
ears
and
stiffened
by
a
white
starched
choker
rolled
several
times
about
the
neck
black
cloth
trousers
long
black
waistcoat
and
ample
of
the
same
color
and
material
he
was
also
careful
never
to
put
aside
either
flannel
undergarments
or
woollen
socks
our
kind
uncle
was
a
pattern
of
propriety
in
everything
but
the
fierce
heat
of
a
french
august
on
a
plain
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
hills
was
too
much
even
for
hamerton
propriety
and
he
had
to
beg
leave
to
remove
his
coat
and
to
sit
in
his
there
was
a
stone
table
under
a
group
of
fine
in
the
garden
not
far
from
the
little
river
to
which
we
used
to
resort
after
dinner
with
our
work
and
books
in
search
of
coolness
and
there
even
my
husband
did
his
writing
one
afternoon
when
we
were
sitting
as
usual
in
this
shady
arbor
all
silent
uncle
dozing
behind
the
newspaper
and
his
nephew
intent
on
literary
composition
what
was
our
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
sedate
aunt
susan
suddenly
jumping
upon
the
table
and
remaining
like
a
marble
statue
upon
its
stone
pedestal
and
quite
as
white
we
all
looked
up
and
uncle
pushed
his
spectacles
high
on
his
forehead
to
have
a
better
sight
of
so
strange
an
attitude
for
his
sister
to
take
at
last
aunt
susan
pointed
to
something
gliding
away
in
the
grass
and
gasped
a
serpent
oh
dear
oh
dear
a
serpent
vainly
did
my
husband
try
to
calm
her
fright
by
explaining
that
it
was
only
an
adder
going
to
seek
the
moisture
of
the
and
never
intending
to
attack
any
one
that
they
were
plentiful
and
frequently
to
be
met
with
when
their
first
care
was
to
pass
unnoticed
our
poor
aunt
would
not
be
persuaded
to
descend
from
her
pedestal
for
some
time
and
not
before
she
was
provided
with
a
long
and
stout
stick
to
beat
the
grass
about
her
as
she
went
back
to
the
house
hamerton
intention
as
well
as
his
sister
was
to
go
to
chamouni
and
the
mer
de
glace
and
to
ask
their
nephew
to
act
as
guide
he
was
glad
enough
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
for
studying
mountain
scenery
but
felt
somewhat
disappointed
that
i
declined
being
one
of
the
party
from
economical
motives
the
letters
i
received
during
their
tour
bore
witness
to
a
fervent
appreciation
of
the
landscape
of
which
a
memento
was
desired
and
gilbert
undertook
to
paint
for
his
relatives
a
small
picture
of
mont
blanc
after
reaching
home
meanwhile
he
took
several
sketches
to
help
him
as
he
was
relating
to
me
afterwards
the
incidents
of
the
journey
he
remembered
a
rather
amusing
one
at
bourg
where
they
had
stopped
to
see
the
church
of
brou
he
came
down
to
the
of
the
hotel
and
found
his
uncle
and
aunt
seated
at
their
frugal
english
breakfast
of
tea
and
eggs
which
he
did
not
share
because
tea
did
not
agree
with
him
but
took
up
a
newspaper
and
waited
for
the
my
word
exclaimed
his
uncle
when
was
over
but
you
do
not
stint
yourself
i
counted
the
dishes
omelette
and
potatoes
and
trout
roasted
pigeons
and
salad
cheese
grapes
and
biscuits
without
mentioning
a
full
bottle
of
wine
excuse
my
curiosity
but
i
should
like
to
know
how
much
you
will
have
to
pay
for
such
a
repast
exactly
two
francs
and
fifty
centimes
answered
his
nephew
and
i
dare
say
your
tea
toast
butter
and
eggs
will
come
to
pretty
near
the
same
amount
for
here
tea
is
an
luxury
and
also
you
had
a
separate
table
to
yourselves
whilst
the
is
a
democratic
institution
then
let
us
be
democrats
as
long
as
we
remain
in
france
if
the
thing
does
not
imply
being
deprived
of
tea
from
london
on
her
way
back
aunt
susan
wrote
we
went
to
the
bedford
hotel
covent
garden
and
bespoke
beds
got
something
to
eat
and
then
set
out
our
first
visit
was
to
piccadilly
where
thursday
was
glad
to
see
us
and
where
we
stayed
a
long
time
well
pleased
to
look
at
your
pictures
i
like
them
all
exceedingly
and
could
not
decide
on
a
choice
they
each
had
in
them
something
i
liked
particularly
when
we
had
been
gone
away
some
time
we
remembered
we
had
not
paid
our
admission
so
we
went
back
this
afforded
us
another
looking
at
the
pictures
and
also
a
pleasing
return
of
a
small
etching
our
choice
was
four
et
la
terrasse
de
we
were
well
contented
with
what
we
got
but
i
did
think
the
proofs
beautiful
hamerton
strong
love
of
etching
had
now
led
him
to
the
practice
of
it
and
for
several
hours
every
day
he
struggled
against
its
technical
difficulties
full
of
hope
and
trust
in
a
final
success
he
turned
from
a
spoilt
plate
to
a
fresh
one
without
discouragement
always
eager
and
relentless
his
main
fault
as
i
thought
was
attempting
too
much
finish
and
effect
and
i
used
to
tell
him
so
he
acknowledged
that
i
was
right
and
when
taking
up
a
new
plate
he
used
to
say
playfully
now
is
going
to
be
a
good
etching
you
do
believe
it
because
you
are
a
little
sceptic
but
you
see
i
mean
not
to
carry
it
far
then
before
biting
he
showed
it
me
with
look
at
it
before
it
is
spoilt
it
was
rarely
spoilt
in
the
biting
but
by
subsequent
work
many
charming
proofs
i
greatly
admired
oh
this
is
only
a
sketch
you
will
see
the
improvement
when
i
have
darkened
this
mass
then
i
begged
hard
that
it
should
be
left
as
it
was
and
i
was
met
by
arguments
that
i
could
not
discuss
the
effect
was
not
true
so
the
lights
were
too
strong
or
the
darks
too
heavy
but
retouching
was
necessary
and
it
ended
in
the
pretty
sketch
being
destroyed
after
having
been
and
two
or
three
times
when
it
was
no
longer
shown
to
me
i
was
aware
of
its
fate
the
amount
of
labor
bestowed
upon
etching
by
my
husband
was
stupendous
as
he
had
to
seek
his
way
without
help
or
advice
a
plate
once
begun
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
it
not
even
in
the
night
and
at
that
time
he
always
had
one
in
hand
heedless
of
his
rules
about
the
division
of
hours
for
literary
work
and
artistic
work
he
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
to
the
pursuit
of
etching
this
made
me
very
uneasy
for
it
had
become
imperative
that
he
should
make
his
work
pay
the
tenant
of
the
had
reiterated
his
decision
not
to
pay
rent
any
longer
and
when
threatened
with
a
answered
that
he
would
put
it
in
chancery
i
had
been
told
that
a
suit
in
chancery
might
last
over
twenty
years
and
we
had
no
means
to
carry
it
on
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
abandon
all
idea
of
redress
and
were
left
dependent
upon
the
earnings
of
my
husband
which
were
derived
from
his
contributions
to
the
fine
arts
quarterly
review
and
to
a
few
periodicals
of
less
importance
from
that
period
of
overwork
and
anxiety
dates
the
nervousness
from
which
he
suffered
so
much
throughout
his
life
though
at
that
time
he
believed
it
to
be
only
temporary
he
sought
relief
in
outdoor
exercise
especially
in
canoeing
and
this
suggested
the
unknown
river
published
later
but
based
on
the
excursions
undertaken
at
that
time
and
on
sketches
and
etchings
done
on
the
way
the
picture
painted
in
remembrance
of
the
journey
in
switzerland
had
been
finished
and
dispatched
and
this
is
what
aunt
susan
wrote
about
it
we
are
now
in
possession
of
our
picture
which
we
received
from
agnew
yesterday
morning
and
we
are
very
much
pleased
with
it
my
impression
is
that
it
is
a
very
good
painting
we
have
not
yet
concluded
where
to
hang
it
for
a
proper
and
good
light
we
are
very
glad
to
hear
that
mary
susan
marguerite
as
uncle
thomas
called
her
is
thriving
and
good
be
sure
and
give
her
a
kiss
for
each
of
us
mary
susan
marguerite
had
been
born
early
in
the
spring
and
to
the
general
wonder
of
the
household
seemed
to
have
reconciled
her
father
to
the
inevitable
cries
and
noises
of
babyhood
brought
up
by
two
maiden
aunts
in
a
large
solitary
house
in
the
country
and
addicted
from
early
youth
to
study
my
husband
had
a
perfect
horror
of
noises
of
all
kinds
and
could
not
understand
that
they
were
unavoidable
in
some
circumstances
he
used
to
call
out
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
the
servants
below
to
stop
their
noise
or
to
hold
their
tongues
whenever
he
overheard
them
singing
to
the
babies
or
laughing
to
amuse
them
and
if
the
children
crying
became
audible
in
the
upper
regions
he
declared
that
the
house
was
not
fit
to
live
in
still
less
to
work
in
one
morning
when
the
youngest
boy
was
loudly
expressing
his
distaste
for
the
ceremonies
of
the
toilet
his
father
no
less
loudly
was
giving
vent
to
his
irritation
at
the
disturbance
and
calling
out
to
shut
the
doors
but
he
could
not
help
being
very
much
amused
by
the
resolute
interference
of
the
eldest
brother
three
years
old
who
crossing
his
little
fat
arms
and
standing
his
ground
firmly
delivered
this
oracle
papa
babies
cry
i
suppose
he
had
heard
this
wise
sentence
from
the
nurse
but
he
gave
it
as
solemnly
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
his
own
reflections
whether
a
few
years
experience
had
rendered
his
father
more
patient
generally
or
whether
he
had
become
alive
to
the
charm
of
babyhood
to
which
he
had
hitherto
remained
insensible
it
was
a
fact
first
noticed
by
the
nurse
that
monsieur
quand
la
petite
criait
voulait
savoir
ce
avait
et
la
prenait
m√™me
dans
ses
bras
pour
la
consoler
a
very
important
event
now
occurred
hamerton
was
appointed
art
critic
to
the
saturday
review
where
he
succeeded
palgrave
at
his
recommendation
he
did
not
accept
the
post
with
much
pleasure
but
it
afforded
him
the
opportunity
of
studying
works
of
art
free
of
expense
and
that
was
a
weighty
consideration
besides
being
an
opening
to
intellectual
and
artistic
intercourse
of
which
he
was
greatly
deprived
at
the
visits
to
the
london
exhibitions
necessitated
two
or
three
journeys
every
year
and
we
both
suffered
from
the
separations
but
i
could
bear
them
better
in
my
own
home
surrounded
by
my
children
visited
by
my
mother
sister
and
brothers
than
my
husband
who
was
alone
amongst
strangers
and
who
had
to
live
in
hotels
a
thing
he
had
a
great
dislike
for
in
order
to
make
these
separations
as
short
as
possible
he
travelled
at
night
by
the
most
rapid
trains
saw
the
exhibitions
in
the
day
and
went
to
his
rooms
to
write
his
articles
by
for
some
time
he
only
felt
fatigued
afterwards
he
became
nervous
but
he
found
compensation
in
the
society
of
his
newly
made
friends
and
in
the
increasing
marks
of
recognition
he
was
now
meeting
everywhere
he
soon
gave
up
hotel
life
and
took
lodgings
in
john
wood
where
he
had
many
acquaintances
and
from
there
he
wrote
to
me
i
have
seen
palgrave
macmillan
rossetti
woolner
and
pearce
palgrave
says
the
review
most
proud
to
have
me
woolner
says
it
is
not
possible
to
succeed
as
an
art
critic
more
than
i
have
done
that
tennyson
has
been
very
much
interested
in
my
articles
and
has
in
consequence
urged
his
publishers
to
employ
dor√©
to
illustrate
the
idylls
of
the
king
they
have
offered
the
job
to
dor√©
who
has
accepted
the
best
news
is
to
come
the
camp
is
a
success
after
all
it
has
fully
cleared
its
expenses
and
macmillan
is
willing
to
venture
on
a
second
edition
revised
and
i
think
he
will
let
me
illustrate
it
he
only
hesitates
has
positively
given
me
a
commission
for
a
work
on
i
am
to
be
paid
whether
it
succeeds
or
not
i
can
not
tell
you
the
exact
sum
but
you
shall
know
it
soon
it
is
to
be
made
up
of
articles
in
different
reviews
it
is
to
be
a
guinea
work
of
pages
beautifully
got
up
with
illustrative
etchings
by
different
masters
and
is
to
be
called
and
etchers
macmillan
said
that
as
to
my
capacity
as
a
writer
there
existed
no
doubt
on
the
subject
he
fully
expects
this
work
on
etching
to
be
a
success
it
is
to
be
out
for
christmas
next
macmillan
is
most
favorably
disposed
to
undertake
other
works
on
condition
that
each
shall
have
a
special
character
like
that
one
on
in
france
and
another
on
in
england
looms
in
the
future
he
prefers
this
plan
to
the
i
mentioned
to
you
the
great
news
in
this
letter
is
that
i
have
written
a
book
which
has
paid
its
expenses
is
not
that
jolly
the
idea
of
a
second
edition
quite
elates
me
so
you
see
darling
things
are
rather
cheering
i
must
say
everybody
receives
me
pleasantly
woodward
is
going
to
give
me
a
whole
day
at
windsor
is
out
of
town
but
called
at
cook
and
said
was
most
anxious
to
see
me
my
husband
wrote
to
me
sometimes
in
french
and
sometimes
in
english
when
my
mother
came
to
keep
me
company
during
his
absence
he
generally
wrote
in
french
to
enable
me
to
read
aloud
some
passages
of
his
letters
that
she
might
find
interesting
the
following
letter
was
written
on
his
first
journey
to
london
for

two
days
later
he
wrote
i
dined
with
the
mackays
yesterday
watkiss
lloyd
was
there
and
other
friends
came
in
the
evening
i
spent
the
day
at
home
writing
but
i
have
an
engagement
for
every
night
this
week
i
am
becoming
a
sort
of
professional
i
have
been
talking
over
the
illustrations
of
the
camp
with
george
leslie
he
has
promised
to
do
twenty
etchings
of
to
illustrate
it
and
i
shall
do
twenty
landscapes
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
haden
here
and
i
feel
sure
now
of
grappling
successfully
with
the
difficulties
which
plagued
me
before
besides
i
am
anxious
to
have
a
book
with
etchings
in
it
out
in
time
to
appear
with
the
work
on
etching
i
am
sure
this
new
edition
of
the
will
be
something
jolly
it
nice
to
think
i
shall
have
two
beautiful
books
out
at
christmas
it
will
give
my
reputation
a
fillip
it
appears
that
charles
dickens
alfred
tennyson
and
george
eliot
are
amongst
my
most
assiduous
readers
is
it
pleasant
to
have
readers
of
that
class
i
will
give
here
a
few
more
extracts
from
his
letters
at
that
time
it
is
the
best
way
of
becoming
acquainted
with
his
method
of
work
as
well
as
with
the
state
of
his
mind
yesterday
i
went
to
see
some
exhibitions
and
photographs
they
are
really
very
fine
quite
different
from
anything
one
ever
saw
before
you
will
be
very
much
struck
with
them
i
am
sure
palgrave
and
i
spent
a
delightful
evening
together
yesterday
we
talked
till
midnight
i
found
him
a
pleasant
companion
we
had
some
music
palgrave
plays
well
he
has
a
nice
collection
of
greek
vases
which
would
delight
mariller
a
who
lived
at
autun
and
who
drew
the
figures
for
the
river
the
more
i
reflect
on
matters
the
more
i
rejoice
to
live
far
away
from
here
known
as
i
am
now
i
am
sure
that
if
i
lived
in
or
near
london
i
should
be
exposed
to
frequent
interruptions
and
gradually
our
dear
little
private
life
would
be
taken
away
from
us
both
besides
this
continued
excitement
would
kill
me
i
could
never
stand
it
i
really
need
quiet
and
i
get
it
at
just
now
i
bear
up
pretty
well
but
i
know
i
could
not
stand
this
for
three
months
out
evening
working
or
seeing
people
or
going
in
omnibuses
and
then
i
need
the
great
refreshment
of
being
able
to
talk
to
thee
and
to
hear
thee
talk
and
play
with
the
children
a
little
all
that
is
good
for
me
in
fact
i
live
upon
it
i
want
to
be
back
again
my
breakfast
in
the
morning
is
a
difficulty
as
you
know
i
never
can
eat
an
english
one
and
if
i
do
i
am
not
fit
for
much
fatigue
the
distances
too
are
terrible
still
on
the
whole
i
keep
better
than
i
expected
to
do
i
hope
the
dear
little
boys
are
both
quite
well
and
my
little
daughter
who
is
the
apple
of
my
eye
about
the
difficulty
of
eating
an
english
breakfast
it
must
be
explained
that
since
gilbert
had
begun
to
suffer
from
nervousness
he
had
given
up
coffee
and
tea
besides
he
only
liked
a
very
light
breakfast
and
we
had
tried
different
kinds
of
food
for
the
morning
meal
chocolate
he
could
not
digest
although
it
was
to
his
taste
cocoa
he
did
not
care
for
beer
and
dry
biscuits
succeeded
for
a
time
but
at
last
we
discovered
that
soup
was
the
best
breakfast
for
him
vegetable
soup
especially
because
it
must
not
be
too
rich
at
home
i
always
made
his
soup
myself
for
being
always
the
same
by
his
own
choice
he
was
particular
about
the
flavor
it
was
merely
with
either
cream
and
parsley
or
with
liebig
and
chervil
in
the
great
summer
heat
he
took
instead
of
it
cold
milk
and
brown
bread
it
may
be
easily
surmised
that
such
a
frugal
meal
could
not
last
him
far
into
the
day
particularly
as
he
was
a
very
early
riser
and
often
had
his
bowl
of
soup
at
six
in
the
morning
then
when
he
felt
hungry
again
at
ten
generally
he
drank
a
glass
of
beer
and
ate
a
slice
of
which
allowed
him
to
await
the
twelve

however
he
had
to
postpone
his
departure
on
account
of
a
distressing
and
alarming
disturbance
of
his
nervous
system
haden
recommended
him
to
give
up
all
kind
of
work
immediately
which
he
did
and
for
a
few
days
he
only
wrote
short

he
wrote
in
answer
to
one
of
my
letters
our
present
business
is
to
look
simply
to
the
question
what
will
be
most
economical
i
have
no
objection
to
any
arrangement
which
will
save
my
keeping
a
man
but
i
have
a
decided
objection
to
that
it
was
about
the
garden
one
half
of
which
i
proposed
to
cede
on
condition
of
having
the
other
half
cultivated
free
of
charge
any
arrangement
you
make
does
not
involve
my
keeping
a
has
my
approbation
beforehand
i
saw
macmillan
again
before
leaving
and
now
he
is
for
bringing
out
the
new
edition
of
the
camp
in
may
it
will
be
a
pretty
little
book
but
i
ca
get
macmillan
to
go
to
the
expense
about
illustrations
colnaghi
will
publish
etchings
for
me
and
after
all
the
hints
and
instructions
received
from
haden
i
feel
quite
sure
that
i
shall
succeed
in
etching
i
expect
to
be
at
in
a
few
days
when
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
all
my
treasures
having
returned
to
london
he
writes
i
spent
last
evening
with
beavington
atkinson
who
was
to
have
come
to
see
us
in
france
you
remember
woodward
wrote
about
him
he
and
his
wife
are
most
agreeable
people
and
i
like
him
really
there
is
something
so
intelligent
and
pleasing
in
his
manner
yesterday
i
went
through
buckingham
palace
to
see
the
pictures
there
is
a
fine
dutch
collection
then
i
went
to
the
british
museum
to
see
the
rembrandt
etchings
and
was
accompanied
by
a
collector
fisher
this
evening
i
am
to
spend
with
haden
again
he
has
a
magnificent
collection
of
etchings
and
will
help
me
very
much
with
my
book
so
now
i
am
sure
of
the
right
quantity
of
assistance
in
my
work
i
was
with
the
editor
of
the
this
afternoon
nothing
could
exceed
his
kind
trustful
way
still
i
wish
i
were
back
with
you
but
i
shall
hurry
now
and
come
back
fast
two
days
later

the
kind
of
life
we
led
at
suited
perfectly
my
tastes
and
he
was
soon
restored
to
health
he
would
have
been
entirely
happy
but
for
pressing
cares
still
thanks
to
his
philosophical
disposition
he
contrived
to
enjoy
what
was
enjoyable
in
his
life
he
was
extremely
fond
of
excursions
in
the
country
and
we
often
used
to
set
off
with
nurse
and
children
in
the
farmer
cart
to
spend
the
day
in
some
picturesque
place
where
he
could
sketch
or
paint
we
had
our
provisions
with
us
and
both
lunched
and
dined
on
the
grass
under
the
fine
chestnuts
or
oaks
so
numerous
in
the
morvan
by
the
side
of
a
clear
stream
or
rivulet
for
running
water
had
a
sort
of
magic
influence
upon
gilbert
and
instinctively
when
unwell
from
nervous
exhaustion
he
sought
its
soothing
influence
we
generally
rambled
about
the
country
after
each
meal
and
whilst
he
drew
i
read
to
him
leaving
the
children
to
their
play
under
the
charge
of
the
nurse
so
far
we
had
taken
upon
ourselves
the
teaching
of
the
boys
but
for
some
time
past
i
had
perceived
that
it
was
becoming
inadequate
to
their
present
requirements
and
i
told
their
father
that
i
thought
they
should
be
sent
to
college
any
rate
the
eldest
who
was
nearly
eight
years
old
but
he
demurred
not
seeing
the
necessity
for
it
he
had
a
notion
that
they
could
be
much
better
educated
at
home
according
to
a
plan
of
his
own
latin
and
greek
would
be
reserved
for
their
teens
because
it
was
a
clear
loss
of
time
before
and
they
would
be
taught
modern
languages
early
together
with
science
and
literature
to
this
i
objected
that
if
successful
it
might
be
a
very
good
education
for
boys
who
were
certain
of
an
independence
but
that
it
did
not
seem
a
good
way
towards
the
degrees
necessary
for
almost
every
one
of
the
liberal
professions
besides
who
was
to
teach
the
boys
when
he
was
away
and
would
he
always
find
spare
time
to
do
it
and
regular
hours
also
i
was
certain
he
would
never
be
punctual
as
to
time
only
he
did
not
like
to
be
told
so
because
being
aware
of
this
shortcoming
he
made
earnest
efforts
to
correct
it
and
constantly
failed
it
was
difficult
to
him
to
bear
any
kind
of
interruption
or
any
compulsory
change
of
work
involving
loss
of
time
and
on
that
score
very
trying
to
one
who
wanted
always
to
finish
what
he
had
in
hand
he
hardly
ever
came
down
at
without
the
bell
being
rung
twice
and
often
when
he
did
come
down
he
used
to
say
that
bell
was
getting
angry
and
he
was
met
with
this
stereotyped
phrase
from
us
and
it
made
you
abandon
the
refractory
sentence
at
last
well
he
acknowledged
there
was
some
weight
in
my
objections
to
home
instruction
but
he
could
give
tasks
to
be
done
in
his
absence
and
correct
them
afterwards
i
asked
who
could
help
the
young
students
when
they
were
in
a
fix
and
would
they
be
always
inclined
to
apply
themselves
steadily
to
their
tasks
without
supervision
that
was
expecting
too
much
but
it
seemed
natural
to
him
to
expect
it
as
study
and
work
had
ever
been
both
a
necessity
and
a
pleasure
to
him
however
he
yielded
but
so
strong
was
his
disapproval
of
public
school
teaching
as
it
was
carried
on
that
at
first
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
had
to
go
to
the
principal
of
the
college
and
make
terms
and
arrangements
the
only
condition
he
made
was
that
the
boys
should
come
home
every
saturday
night
and
remain
till
monday
morning
and
the
same
from
wednesday
to
friday
regularly
for
their
english
lessons
and
for
their
health
i
desired
nothing
better
and
the
principal
agreed
to
it
whenever
the
boys
complained
of
anything
about
their
college
life
afterwards
their
father
used
to
say
i
have
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
did
not
want
you
to
go
to
college
you
know
it
was
your
mother
being
four
kilom√®tres
distant
from
the
town
of
autun
and
five
from
the
college
where
the
boys
had
to
be
in
time
for
the
eight
class
summer
and
winter
it
became
necessary
to
have
some
means
of
conveying
them
to
and
fro
for
they
were
still
very
young
stephen
a
little
over
eight
and
richard
hardly
seven
the
eldest
boy
went
alone
at
first
but
his
brother
soon
insisted
on
going
too
we
decided
to
do
like
most
of
our
country
neighbors
that
is
to
have
a
little
because
it
would
have
been
both
inconvenient
and
expensive
to
hire
the
farmer
so
frequently
accordingly
we
bought
a
small
carriage
with
its
donkey
and
i
was
taught
to
drive
my
husband
would
have
preferred
a
pony
but
i
was
nervous
at
the
idea
of
driving
one
although
i
had
been
told
that
it
was
much
easier
to
manage
than
a
donkey
and
discovered
afterwards
that
it
was
the
truth
the
little
cart
proved
a
great
convenience
for
my
husband
studies
as
he
could
start
with
it
at
any
time
and
there
was
no
trouble
about
the
care
of
the
donkey
the
being
accustomed
to
it
from
infancy
almost
every
household
in
the
vicinity
being
in
possession
of
this
useful
and
inexpensive
animal
there
is
a
morvandau
song
known
to
all
the
little
shepherdesses
in
illustration
of
the
custom

at
first
we
had
a
swift
little
animal
which
could
not
be
stopped
at
all
when
he
was
behind
another
carriage
till
that
carriage
stopped
first
it
was
an
advantage
in
some
cases
for
instance
when
preceded
by
a
good
horse
but
if
the
horse
went
further
than
our
destination
one
of
us
had
to
jump
out
and
hold
back
the
fiery
and
stubborn
little
brute
by
sheer
force
till
his
sense
of
jealous
emulation
was
appeased
the
load
upon
the
cart
when
we
were
all
together
was
found
excessive
for
the
animal
and
my
husband
who
was
always
deeply
concerned
about
the
welfare
of
dumb
creatures
decided
to
have
a
bigger
and
stronger
donkey
he
bought
a
very
fine
one
strong
enough
to
pull
us
all
but
he
did
it
in
such
a
leisurely
fashion
that
he
received
the
expressive
name
of
this
led
my
husband
to
write
to
me
sometimes
from
london
after
a
hard
day
work
here
is
a
very
short
note
but
i
am
like
our
donkey
je
dors

the
editor
of
the
saturday
review
asked
hamerton
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
paris
exhibition
of
and
to
write
a
series
of
articles
on
the
works
of
art
exhibited
then
to
proceed
to
london
for
a
review
of
the
academy
he
wished
me
very
much
to
go
with
him
and
i
being
nothing
loth
we
started
together
and
received
in
paris
the
following
letter
from
aunt
susan
west
lodge
my
dear
nephew
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
from
you
as
i
now
know
where
to
direct
my
epistle
to
you
your
uncle
thought
you
would
not
like
to
come
to
the
exhibition
in
its
very
unfinished
state
and
i
thought
you
would
like
to
be
at
the
opening
of
it
and
so
the
matter
was
resting
quite
unacted
upon
i
grieve
very
much
to
tell
you
of
the
sad
tidings
we
have
of
poor
anne
gould
there
has
been
a
consultation
with
her
medical
men
and
they
pronounce
her
case
very
serious
in
fact
incurable
she
grows
thinner
and
weaker
almost
every
week
and
one
lung
is
said
to
be
affected
a
confinement
is
expected
in
july
and
i
can
not
but
still
hope
that
she
may
possibly
come
round
again
but
it
has
been
sorrowful
news
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
at
west
lodge
when
you
can
make
it
convenient
and
i
do
hope
and
trust
we
shall
be
able
to
enjoy
the
anticipated
pleasure
of
your
company
you
will
have
left
home
with
comparative
comfort
the
boys
being
both
at
college
and
i
expect
grandmamma
with
the
little
sister
i
was
very
glad
when
you
wrote
can
be
in
england
as
it
assured
me
the
little
wife
was
not
to
be
sent
homeward
from
paris
instead
of
accompanying
you
to
west
lodge
where
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
her
nevertheless
i
had
to
go
homewards
for
about
three
weeks
after
our
arrival
in
paris
i
heard
that
my
little
daughter
mary
was
ill
with
bronchitis
and
i
hastened
to
her
whilst
my
husband
was
leaving
for
london
i
was
doubly
sorry
because
he
was
very
reluctant
to
go
alone
but
although
he
felt
a
sort
of
instinctive
dread
of
the
journey
he
did
not
attempt
to
detain
me
he
had
borne
the
very
well
and
the
crowds
which
he
disliked
but
it
was
mainly
because
he
had
been
spared
hotel
life
for
we
had
lodged
with
a
former
servant
of
ours
who
was
married
at
and
now
lived
at
la
glaci√®re
in
paris
it
was
by
no
means
a
fashionable
quarter
and
our
lodgings
left
much
to
be
desired
in
the
way
of
comfort
but
it
will
be
seen
how
much
he
regretted
it
all
when
alone
at
kew
where
he
had
taken
lodgings
after
much
suffering
from
fatigue
and
depression
still
the
first
news
from
london
was
very
gratifying

la
vibration
et
le
mouvement
des
objets
me
font
souffrir
un
peu
on
the
following
sunday
dear
little
wife
last
night
i
passed
the
evening
with
a
set
of
artists
friends
of
george
leslie
at
the
house
of
one
of
them
hodgson
they
acted
charades
and
as
their
costumes
from
their
own
ateliers
were
numerous
and
rich
it
was
very
good
among
them
were
calderon
and
frederick
walker
this
morning
we
all
set
out
for
a
walk
on
hampstead
heath
i
have
no
doubt
the
walk
will
do
me
good
but
i
am
very
well
now
and
feel
better
every
day
i
called
on
rossetti
the
painter
he
lives
in
a
magnificent
house
furnished
with
very
great
taste
but
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
his
is
very
large
indeed
and
most
curious
the
general
effect
is
very
good
he
was
very
kind
in
receiving
me
and
i
saw
his
pictures
which
are
splendid
in
color
and
very
quaint
and
strange
in
sentiment
his
own
manners
are
singularly
soft
and
pleasant
i
called
on
barlow
the
engraver
and
spent
some
time
with
him
about
the
etchings
he
will
lend
me
some
marks
will
lend
me
some
also
the
worst
of
the
way
i
go
on
in
london
now
is
that
society
absorbs
too
much
time
i
must
restrict
it
in
future
very
much
after
the
walk
to
hampstead
he
wrote
yesterday
sunday
i
went
on
a
long
walk
to
hampstead
with
several
artists
who
live
close
together
and
i
never
met
seven
more
agreeable
and
more
gentlemanly
men
i
enjoyed
our
conversation
extremely
george
leslie
and
i
got
some
lunch
at
the
inn
and
walked
back
together
calderon
studio
that
i
saw
a
few
days
ago
is
richly
tapestried
and
very
lofty
it
is
quite
as
fine
as
that
of
millais
it
seems
leighton
has
built
himself
a
studio
forty
feet
long
barlow
the
engraver
has
a
fine
studio
attached
to
the
one
you
saw
him
in
and
far
larger
all
these
artists
complain
of
nothing
but
the
too
great
prosperity
of
the
profession
in
these
days
they
tell
me
an
artist
life
is
a
princely
one
now
they
live
and
dress
like
gentlemen
and
their
daughters
might
be
in
scarlet
the
reason
for
my
staying
in
london
longer
than
i
intended
is
the
time
i
have
spent
in
society
a
thing
i
certainly
shall
never
do
again
because
i
go
to
bed
so
late
after
twelve
whereas
if
i
were
not
in
society
i
should
go
to
bed
at
nine
or
ten
and
keep
my
strength
up
easily
another
thing
i
am
sure
of
is
that
the
the
advantages
of
being
isolated
as
i
am
at
counterbalance
and
more
than
counterbalance
the
disadvantages
i
certainly
would
not
if
i
could
have
a
house
in
london
the
loss
of
time
is
awful
the
only
good
in
it
for
a
painter
is
that
the
dealers
are
always
after
him
for
pictures
as
soon
as
he
succeeds
mind
you
have
a
man
from
the
farm
to
sleep
in
the
house
every
night
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
have
the
gun
loaded
only
take
care
the
children
do
get
at
it
my
health
is
still
tolerably
good
sufficiently
so
for
me
to
get
easily
through
what
i
have
to
do
but
the
next
news
was
far
from
being
so
satisfactory

threatened

his

je

le

toujours

la

crois
que
mon

me
semble
que
si

peuvent
supporter

je

des

la

reculer
mon
d√©part
lundi
du
reste
fait
trois
planches
que
je
crois
bonnes
ai
bien
travaill√©
aussi
√©crit
trois
articles
mais
mon
travail
pour
la
revue
ne
gagne
pas
et
du
moment
o√π
la
peinture
rapportera
je
quitterai
la
revue
je
pas
ce
genre
de
travail
dise
que
je
le
fais
bien
autant
√™tre
cocher
de
fiacre
ce
que
toujours
d√©sir√©
faire
de
la
peinture
mes
efforts
dans
cette
direction
pas
abouti
pr√©sent
mais
si
un
peu
de
temps
libre
je
saurais
mieux
faire
√†
cause
de
mon
exp√©rience
de
critique
je
vois
maintenant
dans
quel
sens
il
faut
travailler
je
vis
√†
londres
aussi
simplement
que
possible
et
pourtant
mes
s√©jours
y
sont
tr√®s
co√ªteux
quant
√†
la
r√©putation
en
comparaison
du
bonheur
de
vivre
tranquillement
avec
toi
elle
absolument
indiff√©rente
il
me
semble
que
lorsque
le
mari
et
la
femme
sont
si
parfaitement
sur
le
but
de
la
vie
il
doit
√™tre
facile
parvenir
notre
plus
grand
d√©sir
√†
tous
les
deux
ensemble
eh
bien
du
moment
o√π
les
choses
nous
seront
propices
nous
r√©aliserons
notre
d√©sir
et
m√™me
par
la
volont√©
nous
forcerons
les
circonstances
que
nous
supporterons
des
inconv√©nients
pour
y
arriver
d√©j√†
wallis
et
colnaghi
consentent
√†
exposer
mes
ouvrages
mes
sont
appr√©ci√©es
dans
un
temps
comparativement
rapproch√©
en
position
de
donner
ma
d√©mission
non
seulement
√†
la
saturday
mais
√†
la
litt√©rature
et
√†
me
d√©vouer
exclusivement
√†
du
moment
o√π
cela
arrivera
il
sera
infiniment
plus
facile
ensemble
car
je
t√¢cherai
de
faire
un
genre
qui
me
permettra
chez
nous
ou
dans
un
petit
rayon
enfin
regardons
la
situation
actuelle
comme
p√©nible
mais
pas
du
tout
permanente
tu
peux
compter
que
du
moment
o√π
je
le
pourrai
je
quitterai
la
revue
suis
bien
d√©cid√©
after
this
letter
my
husband
feeling
much
better
came
back
to
london
to
resume
his
work
and
wrote
about
what
he
thought
most
important
or
most
interesting
to
me
i
shall
quote
from
his
letters
in
their
order
according
to
dates
waterloo

kew
macmillan
re√ßu
parfaitement
presque
affectueusement
il
invit√©
√†
d√Æner
je
suis
all√©
voir
seeley
mon
nouvel
√©diteur
que
trouv√©
intelligent
comme
il
faut
jeune
encore
et
parfaitement
cordial
je
crois
que
mes
relations
avec
lui
seront
faciles
footnote
seeley
had
asked
him
to
write
some
notes
on
contemporary
french
painters
to
be
illustrated
with
photographs
en
somme
est
belle
il
y
a
plusieurs
tableaux
remarquables
entre
autres
une
v√©nus
de
leighton
que
je
trouve
superbe
la

agr√©able
de
rentrer
le
soir
en
pleine
campagne
√ßa
me
fait
du
bien
je
pas
penser
combien
ce
serait
gentil
si
ma
ch√©rie
√©tait
avec
moi
parceque
cela
me
rend
triste
tout
de
suite
mais
je
tous
les
jours
quelquefois
bri√®vement
quand
je
serai
trop
press√©
sois
gentille
toi
et
√©cris
souvent
les
bonnes
nouvelles
que
tu
de
ta
sant√©
et
de
celle
des
enfants
rendu
mon
courage
et
ce
que
je
puis
avoir
de
gaiet√©
il
para√Æt
que
encore
besoin
de
repos
car
je
suis
tr√®s
fatigu√©
que
lundi
mieux
un
ou
deux
jours
de
repos
me
sont
n√©cessaires
voil√†
tout
point
de
surexcitation
je
dors
bien
et
je
me
repose
pleinement
ce
qui
ne
doit
pas
tarder
√†
r√©tablir
mes
forces
je
souffre
seul
gould
va
venir
passer
huit
jours
ici
je
trouve
amiable
de
sa
part
de
bien
vouloir
venir
√†
kew
pour
√™tre
pr√®s
de
moi
mon
oncle
viendra
aussi
je
vais
me
plaindre
un
peu
tout
doucement
de
la
petite
ch√©rie
de
elle
pas
assez
souvent
√†
son
mari
qui
re√ßoit
toujours
ses
lettres
avec
tant
de
plaisir
il
y
a
pourtant
une
de
ces
lettres
qui
a
donn√©
tant
de
bonheur
peut
compter
pour
une
douzaine
pauvre
ch√©rie
comme
je
voudrais
toujours
r√©ussir
√†
rendre
ta
vie
douce
et
agr√©able
depuis
que
je
ne
vis
plus
pour
moi
mais
pour
toi
et
les
enfants
go√ªt√©
un
nouveau
genre
de
bonheur
m√™l√©
de
nouvelles
tristesses
ces
tristesses
sont
dues
√†
la
pens√©e
que
je
fais
si
peu
et
que
avec
plus
de
forces
je
ferais
tant
et
si
bien
avec
la
force
je
serais
s√ªr
maintenant
de
r√©ussir
pleinement
je
tiens
la
r√©putation
par
un
petit
bout
mais
je
la
tiens
et
elle
augmentera
tout
me
prouve
que
notre
avenir
serait
assur√©
si
autant
de
force
que
de
volont√©
je
suis
all√©
voir
george
eliot
et
lewes
qui
a
√©t√©
charmant
il
est
venu
√†
c√¥t√©
de
moi
o√π
il
est
rest√©
tout
le
temps
de
ma
visite
et
lorsque
je
suis
parti
il
beaucoup
plaint
de
ne
pas
me
voir
davantage
il
me
traite
fa√ßon
tr√®s
affectueuse
et
en
m√™me
temps
avec
un
respect
qui
venant
de
lui
me
flatte
beaucoup
quant
√†
george
eliot
elle
est
tr√®s
aimable
mais
elle
a
le
d√©faut
de
rester
toujours
assise
an
m√™me
endroit
et
quand
il
y
a
du
monde
la
seule
personne
qui
puisse
causer
avec
elle
est
son
voisin
quand
retournerai
je
aupr√®s
parce
que
je
tiens
√†
la
conna√Ætre
un
peu
mieux
ai
rencontr√©
ralston
qui
assis
modestement
un
peu
en
dehors
du
cercle
o√π
et
pendant
tout
le
temps
de
sa
visite
il
presque
rien
dit
et
√†
peine
si
on
lui
a
parl√©
trouv√©
ces
arrangements
mauvais
les
gens
qui
re√ßoivent
doivent
souvent
changer
de
place
de
fa√ßon
√†
causer
avec
tous
leurs
visiteurs
lundi
dernier
d√Æn√©
chez

vient
tous
les
jours
en
tu

de

nous
avons
pass√©
une
soir√©e
fort
agr√©able
un
homme
tr√®s
cultiv√©
qui
autrefois
√©tait
auteur
et
qui
a
occup√©
une
chaire
de
litt√©rature
√†
edimbourg
sa
femme
quoique
c√©l√®bre
est
simple
et
tr√®s
aimable

donn√©
ce
livre
je
trouv√©
tr√®s
fort
comme
style
et
hardiesse
√©tonnante
est
des
plus
sympathiques
il
a
des
mani√®res
charmantes
si
modestes
et
si
intelligentes
car
les
mani√®res
peuvent
montrer
de
beaucoup
les
deux
fr√®res
et
dans
le
peu
de
temps
que
je
les
ai
vus
ai
fait
des
amis
mercredi
d√Æn√©
chez
moi
ayant
un
article
√†
√©crire
jeudi
chez
stephen
pearce
vendredi
chez
wallis
le
marchand
de
tableaux
un
homme
tr√®s
d√©licat
et
tr√®s
fin
il
avait
invit√©
burgess
un
artiste
intelligent
et
agr√©able
que
d√©j√†
rencontr√©
au
salon
de
derni√®re
rencontr√©
tom
taylor
√†
wallis
et
nous
avons
caus√©
quelque
temps
ensemble
rencontr√©
clifton
et
d√Æn√©
avec
lui
√†
son
club
lundi
je
suis
all√©
hier
passer
le
tant√¥t
chez
lewes
on
a
√©t√©
enchant√©
de
mes
george
eliot
plainte
de
ne
pas
avoir
assez
caus√©
avec
moi
√†
ma
derni√®re
visite
et
invit√®
√†
prendre
place
√†
c√¥t√©
nous
avons
parl√©
de
litt√©rature
et
m√™me
elle
dit
que
personne
eu
plus
et
de
souffrances
dans
le
travail
et
que
le
peu
fait
lui
co√ªte
√©norm√©ment
discut√©
avec
lewes
de
faire
la
r√©impression
de
mes
articles
et
il
conseill√©
de
ne
pas
le
faire
si
je
puis
fonder
un
livre
sur
ces
articles
que
je
serais
assez
tent√©
de
faire
un
ouvrage
s√©rieux
sur
la
peinture
pour
lequel
mes
articles
serviraient
de
mat√©riel
d√Æn√©
hier
soir
chez
macmillan
nous
√©tions
seuls
il
y
avait
sa
femme
ses
enfants
et
une
il
a
une
famille
nombreuse
de
beaux
enfants
sa
femme
est
bonne
et
si
simple
que
rarement
vu
un
plus
achev√©
sans
√™tre
de
la
distinction
la
maison
est
tr√®s
spacieuse
et
entour√©e
magnifiques
ce
y
a
de
particulier
dans
cette
maison
un
caract√®re
intime
et
ancienne
macmillan
a
su
√©viter
avec
un
tact
parfait
tout
ce
qui
pouvait
rappeler
le
nouveau
riche
on
se
croirait
dans
une
grande
maison
de
campagne
√†
cinquante
lieues
de
londres
et
dans
une
ancienne
famille
√©tablie
l√†
depuis
plusieurs
g√©n√©rations
nous
avons
pass√©
toute
la
soir√©e
ensemble
il
laisse
enti√®rement
√†
mon
jugement
tout
ce
qui
regarde
de
mon
livre
ce
que
aim√©
dans
cette
maison
comme
dans
toutes
les
personnes
que
ai
trouv√©es
a
√©t√©
compl√®te
de
toute
affectation
tout
est
homog√®ne
et
je
encore
jamais
vu
une
maison
de
campagne
ayant
cet
mon
respect
pour
macmillan
consid√©rablement
augment√©e
de
ce
ne
rencontre
chez
lui
aucune
splendeur
vulgaire
rien
ne
parle
chez
lui
la
conversation
a
√©t√©
tr√®s
g√©n√©rale
quand
je
suis
parti
il
reconduit
√†
travers
un
champ
pour
abr√©ger
mon
chemin
√†
la
station
il
a
chant√©
quelques
vieilles
chansons
avec
beaucoup
de
caract√®re
chant√©
un
peu
aussi
et
pourtant
je
ne
suis
gu√®re
dispos√©
√†
chanter
anne
avait
montr√©
tant
de
contentement
quand
je
suis
all√©
la
voir
√†
sheffield
et
penser
que
je
ne
la
reverrai
plus
je
souffre
aussi
pour
mon
oncle
je
me
mets
√†
sa
place
en
pensant
√†
ma
petite
mary
si
je
la
perdais
plus
tard
et
puis
et
puis
tu
sais
comment
viennent
les
id√©es
noires
et
combien
un
malheur
vous
en
fait
craindre
je
me
sens
de
nouveau
fatigu√©
et
cette
fatigue
semble
persister
il
est
bien
possible
que
et
la
nostalgie
y
soient
pour
quelque
chose
y
a
une
jeune
qui
√©t√©
recommand√©e
et
dont
la
situation
est
bien
pr√©caire
eu
la
faiblesse
de
lui
√©crire
une
petite
lettre
gentille
et
encourageante
et
me
voil√†
en
butte
√†
des
√©clats
de
d√©sespoir
ou
de
reconnaissance
de
reproches
et
de
remerciements
le
plaisir
de
faire
du
bien
√†
ceux
qui
souffrent
est
tel
que
voudrait
donner
et
le
critique
est
souvent
tent√©
de
manger
de
ce
je
ne
regrette
pas
de
√©tabli
√†
kew
il
a
chose
contre
kew
que
je
connais
personne
tandis
john
wood
plusieurs
amis
mais
la
solitude
a
aussi
ses
avantages
et
quand
on
voit
du
monde
tous
les
jours
on
peut
bien
passer
la
soir√©e
chez
soi
si
la
petite
femme
√©tait
seulement
ici
ce
serait
parfait
petite
femme
ch√©rie
qui
a
√©t√©
gentille
a
√©crit
deux
lettres
est
simplement
pour
te
dire
que
mon
repos
a
enfin
produit
son
effet
et
que
je
suis
rentr√©
dans
mon
√©tat
ordinaire
je
me
rends
au
mus√©e
et
pu
√©crire
mon
oncle
est
arriv√©
hier
soir
il
partage
mon
salon
mais
je
lui
ai
lou√©
une
dans
la
maison
voisine
il
ne
para√Æt
pas
trop
abattu
nous
causons
beaucoup
et
je
t√¢che
de
autant
que
sa
position
le
permet
il
est
moins
r√©serv√©
et
me
laisse
voir
davantage
le
cours
de
ses
pens√©es
qui
vont
souvent
√†
ses
filles
et
√†
sa
femme
je
√†
il
y
a
une
chose
qui
doit
te
rassurer
quant
√†
de
ma
sant√©
que
je
jamais
ces
sensations
au
cerveau
dont
souffert
le
cerveau
pas
fatigu√©
et
en
me
reposant
√†
temps
je
r√©pare
rapidement
mes
forces
ce
qui
est
vraiment
insupportable
ce
sont
les
s√©parations
et
bien
de
la
peine
√†
r√©signer
et
je
ne
r√©signerais
pas
du
tout
si
la
peinture
rapportait
mais
en
mettant
les
choses
au
pis
pour
les
affaires
que
tu
me
verras
toujours

this

in

grew
with
years
when
at
sens
we
studied
italian
together
but
my
increasing
deafness
made
me
abandon
it
on
account
of
the
pronunciation
whilst
my
husband
on
the
contrary
made
it
a
point
to
read
some
pages
of
it
every
day
and
even
to
write
his
diary
in
that
language

used
to
send
to
florence
some
literary
compositions
to
be
corrected
after
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
he
used
occasionally
to
ask
his
raillard
for
lessons
in
german

had
even
undertaken
to
write
with
his
collaboration
a
work
on
philology
which
was
to
have
been
entitled
words
on
their
travels
and
words
which
his
unexpected
death
cut
short
in

afternoon
of
the
day
on

he
died

de

froment
had
been
most
hospitable
to
both
of
us
during
our
stay
in
paris
he
had
given
us
a
day
at
s√®vres
and
had
shown
us
the
in
all
its
details
he
was
a
widower
and
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
whose
memory
was
as
sacred
to
him
as
religion
his
two
daughters
were
at
home
the
eldest
watching
maternally
over
the
younger
sister
who
however
died
a
few
years
later
feelings
perceptions
and
tastes
were
exquisitely
refined
and
my
husband
derived
both
benefit
and
pleasure
from
the
friendly
intercourse
in
after
years
gilbert
met
froment
occasionally
and
found
him
always
full
of
kindness
and
regard
after
nursing
the
children
through
scarlatina
i
caught
it
myself
and
when
my
husband
knew
of
it
he
wrote
i
write
just
to
say
how
sorry
i
am
not
to
be
able
to
set
off
and
be
at
your
bedside
i
shall
certainly
not
be
later
than
saturday
i
am
of
course
very
busy
and
have
no
time
for
i
have
seen
docteur
dereims
and
told
him
of
your
illness
he
insists
on
the
necessity
of
the
greatest
care
during
your
convalescence
you
must
especially
avoid
as
highly
dangerous
things
are
going
on
as
i
wish
for
my
book
on
etching
i
am
getting
hold
of
plates
which
alone
would
make
it
valuable
pray
take
care
of
yourself
i
wish
i
were
with
you
on
the
following
day
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
you
had
such
a
bad
night
but
from
all
i
can
hear
from
dereims
you
are
only
going
through
the
usual
course
of
the
illness
i
will
be
with
you
on
saturday
without
fail
you
may
count
upon
me
as
upon
an
attentive
though
not
i
fear
a
very
skilful
nurse
but
i
will
try
like
some
other
folks
to
make
up
in
talk
what
i
lack
in
professional
skill
i
am
tolerably
well
but
rather
upset
by
this
news
from
i
could
not
sleep
much
last
night
i
am
going
to
the
exhibition
and
will
be
thinking
of
little
wife
all
the
time
i
have
met
with
a
quantity
of
very
fine
paper
for
etching
of
french
manufacture
and
have
obtained
macmillan
authority
to
purchase
it
for
the
it
will
be
a
splendid
publication
i
feel
greater
and
greater
hopes
about
that
book
only

of
separation
from
the

terminer
mon
travail
when
my
husband
reached
home
i
was
still
in
bed
and
unwilling
to
let
him
come
to
me
for
fear
of
infection
but
he
would
not
hear
of
keeping
away
i
never
catch
anything
he
said
gayly
do
be
anxious
on
my
account
and
he
insisted
upon
sleeping
on
a
little
iron
bedstead
in
the
close
to
our
bedroom
to
nurse
me
in
the
night
he
soon
recovered
his
usual
health
with
occasional
troubles
of
the
nervous
system
but
he
had
grown
careful
about
the
premonitory
symptoms
and
used
to
grant
himself
a
holiday
whenever
they
occurred
having
been
told
whilst
in
london
that
paid
better
than
any
other
literary
production
he
now
turned
his
thoughts
towards
the
possibility
of
using
his
past
experience
for
the
composition
of
a
story
it
would
be
a
pleasant
change
from
criticism
he
said
and
would
exercise
different
mental
faculties
very
soon
the
plan
of
wenderholme
was
formed
and
we
entertained
good
hopes
of
its
success
in
the
month
of
september
the
wedding
of
my
sister
caroline
took
place
quietly
at
our
house
hamerton
being
looked
upon
as
the
head
of
the
family
since
the
death
of
my
father
although
he
prized
his
privacy
above
everything
else
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
it
as
a
token
of
his
affection
for
his
and
went
through
all
the
necessary
trouble
and
expense
for
her
sake
she
married
a
young
man
who
had
formed
an
attachment
for
her
ever
since
she
was
fifteen
years
old
pelletier
and
they
went
to
live
at
algiers
where
he
was
then
commis
at
the
lyc√©e
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
spend
the
long
vacation
with
us
every
year
there
are
a
good
many
days
of
frost
in
a
morvandau
winter
and
the
snow
often
remains
deep
on
the
ground
for
several
weeks
together
there
was
even
more
than
usual
in
so
my
husband
devised
a
new
amusement
for
the
boys
by
showing
them
how
to
make
a
giant
every
time
they
came
home
they
rolled
up
huge
balls
of
snow
which
were
left
out
to
be
frozen
hard
then
sawn
into
large
bricks
to
build
up
the
monster
the
delight
of
the
boys
may
be
imagined
every
new
limb
was
greeted
with
enthusiastic
shouts
they
thought
of
nothing
else
and
perched
on
ladders
their
little
hands
protected
by
woollen
gloves
they
worked
like
slaves
and
could
hardly
be
got
to
eat
their
meals
but
how
should
i
describe
the
final
scene
when
in
the
dark
evening
two
shone
out
of
the
giant
eyes
and
flames
came
out
of
its
monstrous
mouth
it
was
nothing
less
than
wild
ecstasy
their
father
also
taught
them
skating
there
was
very
little
danger
except
from
falls
for
they
began
in
the
meadows
about
the
house
where
they
skated
over
shallow
pools
left
in
the
hollows
by
or
melted
snow
but
when
they
became
proficient
we
used
to
go
to
the
great
pond
at
varolles
as
my
husband
has
said
in
one
of
his
letters
all
that
was
very
good
for
him
in
january
he
left
again
for
london
and
felt
but
little
inconvenience
on
the
way
and
during
his
stay
knowing
that
i
should
be
anxious
he
formed
the
habit
of
sending
me
frequent
short
pencil
notes
to
say
how
he
was

here

few

this
was
about
a
serious
accident
which
had
happened
to
our
youngest
boy
whilst
at
play
with
his
brother
on
the
terrace
and
in
my
presence
he
ran
his
head
against
a
low
wall
and
was
felled
senseless
to
the
ground
by
the
force
of
the
blow
the
temple
was
cut
open
and
his
blood
ran
over
my
arm
and
dress
when
i
lifted
him
up
apparently
lifeless
the
farmer
cart
drove
us
rapidly
to
autun
where
we
found
our
doctor
in
bed
it
was
ten
at
night
the
wound
was
dressed
and
sewn
up
and
the
pain
brought
back
some
signs
of
life
i
asked
if
i
ought
to
take
a
room
at
the
hotel
to
secure
the
doctor
attendance
at
short
intervals
but
i
was
told
that
blows
of
that
kind
were
either
fatal
or
of
little
importance
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
keep
ice
on
the
head
and
renew
it
constantly
the
poor
child
seemed
to
have
relapsed
into
an
insensible
state
and
remained
so
all
night
in
the
early
morning
however
he
awoke
without
fever
and
was
quite
well
in
about
three
weeks
i
had
asked
my
husband
to
take
the
opinion
of
an
aurist
about
my
increasing
deafness
and
he
tenderly
answered
s√©rieusement
je
ne
crois
pas
que
ta
surdit√©
augmente
avant
de
te
rendre
compte
combien
tu
√©tais
sourde
tu
ne
savais

quels
bruits
restaient

pour
puisque
ce
que
tu

je
sais
que
tu
es
tr√®s
sourde
mais
je
ne

pas
depuis
tr√®s
longtemps
et
je
crois
que
tu
resteras
√†

pr√®s
comme
tu
es
ai
parl√©
avec
macmillan
dont
une
amie
√©t√©
comme
toi
pendant
longtemps
et
qui
√©prouve
maintenant
une
am√©lioration
graduelle
mais
tr√®s
sensible
t√¢che
surtout
de
ne
pas
trop
parce
para√Æt
que
le
chagrin
a
une
tendance
√†
augmenter
la
surdit√©
quant
√†
parler
mieux
mourir
tu
oublies
que
mon
affection
pour
toi
est
bien
de
toute
infirmit√©
corporelle
et
que
nous
aurons
toujours
beaucoup
de
bonheur
√†
√™tre
ensemble
du
moins
je
parle
pour

ta

he
sympathized
so
much
with
my
trouble
that
unlike
many
other
husbands
who
would
have
been
annoyed
at
having
to
take
a
deaf
wife
into
society
he
urged
me
to
go
with
him
everywhere
kindly
repeated
what
i
had
not
heard
and
explained
what
i
misunderstood
he
always
tried
his
best
to
keep
away
from
me
the
feeling
of
solitude
so
common
to
those
who
are
deprived
of
hearing
just
as
i
was
rejoicing
over
the
thought
that
my
husband
had
prosperously
accomplished
this
last
journey
i
had
a
letter
from
him
dated
h√¥tel
du
nord
amiens
in
which
he
said
he
was
obliged
to
stop
there
till
he
felt
better
for
he
could
eat
absolutely
nothing
and
was
very
weak
the
worst
was
that
i
dared
not
leave
my
poor
little
richard
yet
to
go
to
his
father
the
wound
on
the
temple
was
not
healed
and
the
doctor
had
forbidden
all
excitement
for
fear
of
after
the
shock
i
was
terribly
perplexed

the
following
letter
reached

he
reached
home
safely
but
the
fatigue
and
weakness
seemed
to
last
longer
than
previously
and
insomnia
frequently
recurred
he
did
his
best
to
insure
refreshing
sleep
by
taking
more
exercise
in
the
open
air
but
it
became
clear
that
he
must
abandon
work
at
night
because
when
his
brain
had
been
working
on
some
particular
subject
he
could
not
quiet
it
at
once
by
going
to
bed
and
it
went
on
in
spite
of
himself
to
a
state
of
great
cerebral
excitement
during
which
production
was
rapid
and
felicitous
therefore
tempting
but
it
was
paid
for
too
dearly
by
the
nervous
exhaustion
surely
following
it
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
on
his
part
because
he
liked
nothing
better
than
to
wait
till
every
one
had
retired
and
the
house
was
all
quiet
and
silent
to
sit
down
to
his
desk
under
the
lamp
and
write
undisturbed
and
without
fear
of
disturbance
till
dawn
put
out
the
stars
he
now
changed
his
rules
and
devoted
the
evenings
to
reading
chapter
ix
studies
of
a
strange
illness
at
resignation
of
post
on
the
saturday
review
nervous
seizure
in
railway
mrs
publication
of
etching
and
etchers
growing
reputation
in
america
in
the
course
of
the
years
hamerton
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
leading
french
artists
dor√©
corot
daubigny
courbet
landelle
lalanne
rajon
flameng
jacquemart
etc
the
etchers
he
frequently
met
at
cadart
where
they
came
to
see
proofs
of
their
etchings
the
painters
he
went
to
see
for
the
preparation
of
his
contemporary
french
painters
and
painting
in
france
together
with
these
works
he
had
begun
his
first
novel
wenderholme
and
had
been
contemplating
for
some
time
the
possibility
of
lecturing
on
aesthetics
i
was
adverse
to
this
last
plan
on
account
of
his
nervous
state
which
did
not
seem
to
allow
so
great
an
excitement
as
that
of
appearing
in
public
at
stated
times
i
persuaded
him
at
least
to
delay
the
realization
of
the
project
till
he
had
quite
recovered
his
health
despite
the
invitations
he
had
received
both
from
england
and
america
he
continued
to
paint
from
nature
with
the
intention
of
resigning
his
post
on
the
saturday
review
in
case
of
success
but
now
devoted
more
of
his
time
to
the
study
of
animals
principally
oxen
as
he
liked
to
have
models
at
hand
without
leaving
home
desiring
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
anatomy
of
the
ox
he
bought
one
which
had
died
at
the
farm
and
had
it
boiled
in
parts
till
the
flesh
was
separated
from
the
bones
which
were
then
exposed
to
dry
in
the
sunshine
when
thoroughly
dried
they
were
kept
in
the
garret
and
successively
taken
to
the
studio
to
serve
for
a
series
of
drawings
of
which
i
still
possess
several
as
we
had
a
goat
and
sometimes
kids
he
also
made
numerous
sketches
from
them
as
well
as
from
ducks
sheep
and
lambs
hens
and
chickens
there
was
also
a
waterloo
veteran
who
came
weekly
as
a
model
and
who
was
painted
in
a
monk
dress
which
my
husband
used
afterwards
and
for
a
long
time
as
a
this
habit
of
sketching
animals
whenever
he
had
a
chance
gave
rise
to
some
amusing
incidents
before
our
peasant
neighbors
knew
that
he
painted
portraits
of
dumb
beasts
as
well
as
of
christians
some
farmers
wives
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
odd
pennies
in
the
pockets
of
their
offspring
accused
them
of
pilfering
but
on
being
told
that
the
gros
sous
had
been
given
them
by
le
p√®re
anglais
came
to
our
house
to
ascertain
how
and
why
for
unlike
the
people
of
the
south
they
would
not
have
tolerated
begging
they
were
quieted
by
the
assurance
that
the
money
had
been
honestly
earned
by
the
children
for
holding
their
goat
or
donkey
whilst
its
portrait
was
taken
nay
they
even
felt
a
little
proud
that
an
animal
of
theirs
should
have
been
thought
worthy
of
such
an
honor
etching
in
all
its
forms
was
pursued
at
the
same
time
with
lithography
and
photography
even
a
new
kind
of
transparent
etching
ground
was
invented
by
hamerton
which
made
it
possible
for
etchers
to
see
the
work
already
done
upon
a
plate
after
having
it
grounded
again
for
correction
or
additional
work
a
strange
incident
occurred
during
this
winter
my
husband
rising
reputation
had
it
appears
given
to
many
people
a
desire
for
his
personal
acquaintance
or
for
intercourse
by
correspondence
the
first
desire
brought
him
many
unexpected
visitors
the
second
quite
an
appreciable
increase
of
work
as
he
hardly
ever
left
a
letter
unanswered
to
give
the
reader
an
instance
of
the
extraordinary
notions
entertained
by
some
people
i
shall
relate
the
true
history
of
one
visitor
amongst
others
some
letters
at
short
intervals
from
england
signed
let
us
say
beamish
mentioned
a
mysterious
project
which
could
not
possibly
be
explained
otherwise
than
by
word
of
mouth
and
which
might
be
both
profitable
and
agreeable
to
hamerton
if
realized
he
was
asked
to
call
upon
the
correspondent
for
an
explanation
if
he
should
happen
to
go
to
london
soon
if
not
beamish
begged
leave
to
come
over
and
see
him
of
course
the
leave
was
given
and
the
gentleman
having
written
that
on
such
a
day
he
would
be
at
such
an
hotel
in
autun
gilbert
went
to
fetch
him
in
the
for
had
tired
out
our
patience
and
had
been
replaced
by
a
beautiful
and
energetic
little
pony
called
cocote
when
we
met
beamish
we
found
him
a
most
prepossessing
young
man
of
elegant
manners
and
refined
speech
in
short
a
gentleman
he
begged
me
to
allow
his
portmanteau
to
be
placed
in
the
carriage
and
as
i
observed
that
he
was
not
expected
to
dress
for
our
family
dinner
he
answered
that
it
only
contained
papers
that
he
should
want
two
other
friends
understanding
english
joined
us
at
dinner
the
conversation
was
animated
but
beamish
never
hinted
at
the
mysterious
project
in
the
evening
engravings
and
etchings
were
shown
to
our
guest
but
failed
to
excite
his
interest
for
he
soon
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
let
our
friends
go
without
awaking
unwilling
to
disturb
him
we
remained
till
nearly
one
when
i
decided
to
retire
whatever
happened
afterwards
and
i
was
so
tired
that
after
going
to
bed
i
never
awoke
till
morning
when
i
asked
my
husband
at
what
time
beamish
had
gone
gone
he
answered
why
i
do
know
that
he
has
gone
at
all
for
i
left
him
after
three
just
where
he
was
i
hardly
dared
peep
into
the
however
it
was
empty
but
when
the
was
rung
beamish
came
in
unconcernedly
to
have
his
share
of
the
simple
meal
during
which
he
talked
pleasantly
and
intelligently
of
his
experiences
in
india
where
he
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
eighteen
years
nothing
was
said
of
the
project
and
after
vainly
waiting
for
some
mention
of
it
my
husband
returned
to
his
study
after
letting
beamish
know
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
till
eleven
for
it
was
the
time
of
his
morning
work
very
well
answered
our
guest
meanwhile
i
shall
put
my
books
and
papers
in
order
at
the
same
time
he
requested
me
to
send
rather
a
large
table
into
the
room
where
he
had
slept
it
was
the
room
in
which
his
portmanteau
had
been
put
and
to
tell
the
servants
to
be
careful
not
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
what
he
would
leave
upon
it
not
even
to
dust
long
as
he
remained
with
i
then
believed
that
gilbert
had
invited
him
to
stay
some
time
but
i
was
undeceived
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
told
that
the
mysterious
project
had
been
unfolded
at
last
and
was
a
proposition
that
he
should
undertake
a
journey
to
palestine
in
the
company
of
beamish
to
join
holman
hunt
who
was
painting
studies
in
the
holy
land
but
what
made
you
think
i
was
ready
to
undertake
such
a
pilgrimage
hamerton
had
asked
in
great
astonishment
because
i
read
that
you
liked
camping
out
was
the
reply
and
thought
also
that
being
an
artist
you
would
be
glad
to
meet
with
holman
hunt
who
like
you
in
the
highlands
works
directly
from
nature
i
thought
moreover
that
as
i
intend
to
go
myself
you
would
be
agreeable
and
profitable
society
although
my
husband
had
declined
to
give
the
slightest
consideration
to
this
plan
beamish
still
remained
and
vaguely
hinted
that
a
still
more
mysterious
project
detained
him
at
autun
he
went
on
foot
alone
to
the
college
on
three
successive
afternoons
begged
to
see
our
boys
and
tipped
them
so
generously
that
the
principal
thought
it
his
duty
to
ask
their
father
whether
he
had
authorized
these
visits
clearly
implying
that
he
doubted
the
soundness
of
the
mind
we
had
learned
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
our
guest
was
of
a
benevolent
and
charitable
disposition
and
that
he
had
spent
much
money
in
india
in
founding
for
poor
women
whose
sufferings
he
warmly
compassionated
he
was
also
full
of
sympathy
for
the
indian
people
and
spoke
of
their
wrongs
not
without
a
certain
degree
of
excitement
but
still
in
a
manner
to
arouse
our
interest
altogether
although
he
was
a
guest
we
had
already
learned
to
like
him
and
were
unwilling
to
remind
him
with
ever
so
little
rudeness
that
he
was
in
the
way
my
husband
said
that
his
conduct
might
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
had
lived
so
long
in
india
where
the
dwellings
of
europeans
are
often
at
great
distances
from
each
other
and
where
a
visitor
is
always
made
at
home
and
welcome
that
beamish
was
only
acting
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
for
the
greater
part
of
his
life
for
he
was
still
a
young
man
of
about
after
about
a
week
stay
he
began
to
talk
of
leaving
us
within
a
short
time
but
did
not
say
when
that
would
depend
on
circumstances
however
on
a
bitterly
cold
evening
with
the
snow
deep
on
the
ground
he
requested
to
be
driven
to
autun
and
took
a
friendly
leave
of
us
all
without
explanation
but
the
principal
of
the
college
related
the
following
strange
story
to
hamerton
your
friend
beamish
whom
i
had
met
at
your
house
came
here
under
pretext
of
seeing
your
sons
but
called
upon
me
and
asked
if
i
would
give
him
my
help
in
a
charitable
deed
of
some
importance
is
the
nature
of
the
deed
was
my
first
question
salvation
of
a
soul
what
form
i
did
not
get
a
direct
answer
but
i
was
told
that
the
idea
had
sprung
from
religious
motives
and
that
knowing
my
strong
attachment
to
religion
though
it
was
the
roman
catholic
religion
he
hoped
i
should
have
sufficient
moral
courage
to
help
him
in
his
deed
of
mercy
in
fact
he
had
resolved
to
reclaim
a
fallen
woman
vainly
did
i
attempt
to
turn
him
from
his
generous
but
impracticable
resolution
he
threatened
to
act
alone
if
i
refused
him
the
sanction
of
my
presence
but
he
hoped
that
the
aum√¥nier
would
see
his
action
in
its
true
light
and
putting
himself
above
popular
suspicion
would
accompany
him
the
very
den
of
sin
to
offer
salvation
to
a
lost
but
it
was
useless
to
try
to
make
him
understand
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
aum√¥nier
to
risk
his
character
even
with
the
hope
of
doing
good
and
at
last
beamish
expressed
a
desire
to
meet
him
in
my
presence
on
the
morrow
our
worthy
aum√¥nier
was
horrified
at
the
idea
of
the
kind
of
sinners
he
would
have
to
meet
and
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
wildly
charitable
scheme
the
next
news
was
brought
to
autun
four
days
later
by
the
woman
whom
poor
beamish
thought
he
had
rescued
at
the
cost
of
four
hundred
francs
for
her
liberation
from
debt
and
about
two
hundred
more
for
decent
clothing
he
had
taken
her
as
far
as
dijon
where
he
had
left
her
in
some
kind
of
reformatory
but
after
enjoying
the
change
and
with
her
purse
replenished
to
carry
her
through
the
first
difficulties
of
an
honest
life
she
hastened
back
to
the
old
haunt
to
gibe
and
jeer
at
her
benefactor
another
queer
visitor
was
an
english
gentleman
past
middle
age
who
could
never
find
his
way
back
to
our
house
but
invariably
appeared
at
in
the
of
some
neighbor
who
had
to
escort
him
to
the
opening
of
the
academy
exhibition
had
come
round
again
and
hamerton
had
to
go
and
criticise
it
as
usual
but
after
reaching
amiens
he
felt
so
poorly
that
he
resolved
to
send
his
resignation
to
the
saturday
review
and
to
return
home
as
quickly
as
he
could
here
is
his
letter
to
me

je

qui

bient√¥t
i
decided
at
once
to
go
to
him
my
mother
who
had
come
to
stay
with
me
during
his
absence
approved
my
resolution
and
undertook
the
management
of
the
house
and
the
care
of
the
children
so
without
asking
for
his
leave
i
wrote
that
i
was
on
my
way
to
amiens
his
joy
was
great
when
he
saw
me
and
his
progress
towards
recovery
was
so
rapid
that
he
abandoned
the
idea
of
retracing
his
steps
and
encouraged
by
my
presence
thought
he
could
accomplish
the
journey
to
london
without
danger
it
was
of
great
importance
that
he
should
keep
his
post
on
the
saturday
review
because
it
was
his
only
income
everything
else
being
uncertain
and
we
knew
that
if
he
could
undertake
the
work
again
it
would
be
readily
entrusted
to
him
we
only
stayed
two
days
at
amiens
and
as
my
husband
was
never
seasick
or
nervous
on
the
sea
everything
went
on
satisfactorily
so
far
but
as
soon
as
we
had
left
dover
for
london
i
perceived
signs
of
uneasiness
in
his
behavior
he
closed
his
eyes
not
to
see
the
moving
objects
we
passed
he
uncovered
his
head
which
seemed
burning
by
the
flushed
face
he
chafed
his
cold
bloodless
hands
and
shuffled
his
feet
to
bring
back
circulation
for
a
long
time
he
attempted
to
hide
these
alarming
symptoms
from
me
but
i
had
detected
them
from
the
beginning
his
eyes
had
a
look
and
unusual
steely
brilliancy
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
rigid
almost
defiant
as
if
ready
to
overthrow
any
obstacle
in
his
way
and
indeed
it
was
the
case
for
unable
to
control
himself
any
longer
he
got
up
and
told
me
hoarsely
that
he
was
going
to
jump
out
of
the
train
i
took
hold
of
his
hands
and
said
i
would
follow
only
i
entreated
him
to
wait
a
short
time
as
we
were
so
near
a
station
i
placed
myself
quite
close
to
the
door
of
the
railway
carriage
and
stood
between
it
and
him
happily
we
near
a
station
else
i
do
know
what
might
have
happened
he
rushed
out
of
carriage
and
station
into
the
fields
whilst
i
followed
like
one
dazed
and
almost
after
he
lessened
his
pace
and
turned
to
me
to
say
i
think
it
is
going
i
could
not
speak
for
fear
of
bursting
into
tears
but
i
pressed
his
hand
in
mine
and
held
it
as
we
continued
our
miserable
way
across
the
fields
we
walked
perhaps
two
hours
at
the
end
of
which
gilbert
said
tenderly
in
his
usual
voice
you
must
be
terribly
tired
my
poor
darling
i
think
i
could
bear
to
rest
now
we
may
try
to
sit
down
we
sat
down
upon
a
fallen
tree
and
after
some
minutes
he
told
me
that
if
i
could
get
him
a
glass
of
beer
somewhere
it
would
bring
him
round
i
went
in
search
of
an
inn
and
discovered
a
closed
one
for
it
was
sunday
and
the
time
of
afternoon
service
nevertheless
i
knocked
so
perseveringly
that
a
woman
came
forth
incensed
by
my
pertinacity
and
peremptorily
refused
with
indignation
any
kind
of
drink
to
obtain
a
bottle
of
beer
i
had
to
take
an
oath
that
it
was
for
a
patient
the
glass
of
ale
at
once
calmed
and
revived
my
husband
and
when
the
bottle
had
been
emptied
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
he
was
himself
again
and
felt
hungry
we
did
not
know
the
place
it
was
adisham
we
had
no
luggage
and
as
to
resuming
our
journey
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
some
time
at
least
so
i
went
again
to
the
inn
and
asked
the
woman
if
she
could
give
us
a
room
no
there
was
not
one
ready
and
then
it
was
so
suspicious
people
coming
like
that
through
the
fields
and
without
luggage
i
offered
to
pay
in
advance
but
we
might
be
runaways
my
husband
had
his
passport
and
i
explained
that
he
had
been
taken
ill
suddenly
and
that
our
luggage
could
be
sent
to
us
from
london
if
the
gentleman
were
to
die
here
it
would
be
a
great
trouble
i
had
to
assure
her
that
it
was
not
dangerous
and
that
rest
only
was
required
at
last
she
consented
to
show
me
into
a
very
clean
room
deprecating
volubly
the
absence
of
curtains
and
bedstead
in
such
an
emergency
but
promising
to
put
them
up
shortly
if
we
remained
some
time
the
bedding
was
laid
upon
the
carpet
the
mattresses
had
just
undergone
a
thorough
cleaning
and
the
sheets
and
counterpane
smelt
sweet
when
night
came
we
were
thankful
to
rest
our
tired
limbs
even
on
the
floor
and
to
hope
that
sleep
would
bury
in
oblivion
the
anguish
of
the
day
at
least
for
a
while
oh
the
weary
weary
time
spent
there
without
work
without
books
and
with
but
little
hope
of
better
days
how
should
we
get
out
of
it
and
when
it
was
now
clear
that
these
terrible
attacks
were
due
to
railway
travelling
then
how
should
we
ever
get
home
again
our
luggage
had
been
telegraphed
for
and
returned
and
the
appearance
of
the
trunks
had
evidently
inspired
some
confidence
in
our
landlady
materially
we
were
comfortable
enough
a
clean
bedroom
a
quiet
rather
large
it
was
the
usual
public
but
it
being
early
in
the
season
there
were
no
boarders
besides
ourselves
and
the
cookery
though
simple
and
unvaried
was
good
of
its
kind
alternately
ham
and
eggs
and
chops
with
boiled
potatoes
rice
pudding
or
gooseberry
tart
morning
after
morning
my
husband
wondered
if
he
would
feel
equal
to
resuming
the
journey
but
the
necessary
was
found
wanting
still
we
walked
out
slowly
and
aimlessly
and
we
chose
for
our
long
walks
the
most
solitary
lanes
gilbert
felt
that
the
air
impregnated
by
was
gradually
invigorating
him
and
after
three
weeks
of
this
melancholy
existence
made
up
his
mind
to
order
a
carriage
to
take
us
as
far
as
canterbury
the
long
drive
and
change
did
him
good
and
he
was
well
enough
to
take
me
to
the
cathedral
and
show
me
the
town
where
we
lingered
two
days
and
then
took
another
carriage
for
croydon
at
that
stage
my
husband
told
me
that
we
were
not
far
from
beckenham
and
proposed
that
we
should
call
upon
and
craik
on
the
following
day
i
shall
never
forget
the
kindness
of
the
reception
nor
the
sympathy
of
our
hostess
i
was
surprised
to
see
my
husband
enjoying
conversation
and
society
so
much
because
when
he
was
unwell
he
shrank
from
meeting
with
any
one
and
required
complete
solitude
he
only
wished
to
feel
that
i
was
near
him
without
fretting
and
in
silence
but
the
charming
simplicity
of
the
welcome
in
the
garden
the
peacefulness
not
only
of
the
dwelling
but
still
more
the
calm
and
sweet
aspect
of
the
celebrated
authoress
together
with
her
husband
friendly
manner
acted
soothingly
upon
the
nerves
of
their
visitor
he
told
without
reticence
what
had
happened
and
soon
changed
the
subject
to
fall
into
an
animated
and
interesting
conversation
after
lunch
craik
made
me
walk
in
the
garden
with
her
and
inquired
more
closely
into
the
particulars
of
this
strange
illness
she
encouraged
and
comforted
me
greatly
she
was
tall
and
though
very
beautiful
still
i
thought
as
we
walked
she
bent
her
head
covered
with
the
highland
blue
bonnet
over
mine
and
as
she
clasped
my
shoulders
within
her
arm
i
could
see
her
hand
laid
upon
my
breast
as
if
to
soothe
it
it
was
the
loveliest
hand
i
ever
saw
the
shape
so
perfect
the
skin
so
white
and
soft
we
spoke
french
together
she
was
interested
about
france
and
liked
talking
of
its
people
and
customs
before
we
left
she
asked
me
to
write
to
her
and
offered
to
render
me
any
service
i
might
require
the
journey
to
todmorden
was
not
to
be
thought
of
this
time
and
gilbert
had
begged
his
uncle
and
aunt
to
meet
us
at
kew
if
they
could
manage
it
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
he
found
lodgings
for
them
not
far
from
ours
nearly
opposite
to
the
church
knowing
that
his
book
must
now
be
ready
he
longed
to
see
a
copy
of
it
and
feeling
well
enough
one
morning
he
started
with
me
for
london
but
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
heart
of
the
town
its
bustle
crowd
and
noise
drove
my
husband
to
the
comparative
peace
of
the
nearest
park
there
as
usual
in
such
cases
we
had
to
walk
till
his
nerves
were
calmed
and
then
to
sit
down
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
think
he
would
be
equal
to
the
busy
streets
that
day
and
asked
me
to
take
a
cab
and
see
if
i
could
bring
him
back
a
copy
of
his
book
reluctantly
i
left
him
though
he
assured
me
the
attack
was
over
only
he
was
afraid
of
bringing
it
on
again
if
he
went
into
the
street
so
i
was
driven
to
macmillan
house
of
business
and
immediately
received
by
him
he
was
evidently
truly
sorry
to
hear
that
my
husband
was
unwell
and
etching
and
etchers
being
upon
his
table
he
took
up
a
copy
and
with
many
warm
praises
insisted
upon
placing
it
himself
in
my
cab
the
book
was
everything
that
its
author
had
desired
and
taken
so
much
pains
to
ensure
he
was
gratified
by
the
result
and
gratefully
acknowledged
the
liberality
of
the
publishers
one
of
the
first
visits
paid
by
hamerton
when
he
felt
well
again
was
to
cook
of
the
saturday
review
who
was
himself
out
of
health
through
overwork
he
feelingly
expressed
his
regret
that
my
husband
could
not
continue
to
act
as
regular
art
critic
but
trusted
that
he
would
still
contribute
to
the
saturday
as
much
as
possible
and
on
subjects
he
might
himself
select
next
we
saw
seymour
haden
and
i
begged
him
to
try
and
discover
what
was
the
nature
of
my
husband
ailment
it
was
no
easy
matter
as
the
patient
refused
to
submit
to
examination
and
to
prescriptions
of
any
kind
haden
who
was
full
of
sympathy
and
kindness
apprised
her
husband
of
this
peculiarity
and
he
undertook
to
so
the
next
time
we
called
by
invitation
he
looked
steadily
at
his
guest
for
some
time
and
said
to
him
deliberately
you
are
ill
it
no
use
denying
it
to
me
you
must
give
up
all
work
not
in
a
month
or
a
week
or
but
instantly
my
husband
flushed
so
that
i
trembled
in
fear
of
another
seizure
and
answered
angrily
i
can
not
give
up
work
i
work
for
my
family
i
shall
try
to
work
less
i
say
you
are
to
give
up
all
mental
labor
immediately
i
shall
see
later
what
amount
of
intellectual
work
you
are
able
to
bear
according
to
the
state
you
will
be
in
you
may
break
stones
on
the
road
but
i
forbid
you
to
hold
a
pen
for
literary
composition
and
once
back
home
you
must
renounce
railway
travelling
as
long
as
it
produces
uncomfortable
sensations
all
this
was
said
imperatively
and
although
it
drove
my
husband
almost
to
desperation
i
thanked
haden
in
my
heart
for
his
courageous
and
timely
interference
and
gilbert
did
the
same
after
recovering
from
the
shock
this
time
he
did
not
feel
either
so
sad
or
so
despondent
as
formerly
when
he
had
suffered
alone
he
knew
now
for
certain
that
the
causes
of
his
trouble
were
overwork
and
railway
travelling
and
he
took
the
resolution
of
avoiding
both
dangers
as
much
as
possible
whenever
he
felt
nervous
we
remained
quietly
at
kew
reading
or
sketching
or
walking
in
solitary
places
with
his
uncle
and
aunt
and
when
he
thought
himself
well
enough
we
went
to
london
by
boat
or
omnibus
to
the
british
museum
the
national
gallery
or
south
kensington
museum
and
to
the
public
or
private
art
exhibitions
we
also
paid
calls
and
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
was
introduced
to
george
eliot
and
to
lewes
the
latter
sat
by
us
on
a
sofa
outside
of
the
inner
circle
the
room
was
full
and
talked
with
wonderful
vivacity
and
great
discrimination
of
the
state
of
french
literature
he
judged
of
it
like
a
frenchman
his
conversation
was
extremely
interesting
and
suggestive
and
he
appeared
to
derive
great
pleasure
from
a
rapid
exchange
of
thoughts
undeniably
he
was
very
plain
when
you
had
time
to
think
of
it
but
it
was
with
him
as
with
the
celebrated
advocate
cr√©mieux
so
much
caricatured
neither
of
them
seemed
at
all
plain
to
me
as
soon
as
they
spoke
both
had
expressive
eyes
and
countenance
and
the
interest
awakened
by
the
varying
expression
of
the
features
did
not
allow
one
to
think
of
their
want
of
symmetry
and
shape
the
person
who
sat
next
to
george
eliot
seemed
determined
to
monopolize
her
attention
but
as
a
was
announced
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
kindly
taking
me
by
the
hand
made
me
sit
in
the
chair
she
had
herself
occupied
and
motioned
to
my
husband
to
come
also
he
remained
standing
inside
the
circle
whilst
the
monopolizer
had
at
once
to
yield
his
seat
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
well
as
a
share
of
her
conversation
to
others
than
himself
i
immediately
recognized
the
description
given
of
her
by
my
husband
her
face
expressed
at
the
same
time
great
mental
power
and
a
sort
of
melancholy
human
sympathy
her
voice
was
though
low
and
wonderfully
modulated
we
were
frequently
interrupted
by
people
just
coming
in
and
with
each
and
all
she
exchanged
a
few
phrases
appropriate
to
the
position
pursuit
or
character
of
her
interlocutor
immediately
to
revert
to
the
subject
of
our
conversation
with
the
utmost
apparent
ease
and
pleasure
lewes
offered
tea
himself
because
the
worshippers
surrounded
the
idol
so
closely
that
they
kept
her
a
prisoner
within
a
double
circle
and
they
were
so
eager
for
a
few
words
from
her
lips
that
as
soon
as
she
moved
a
step
or
two
they
crowded
about
her
in
a
way
to
make
me
think
that
in
a
small
way
and
in
her
own
she
was
mobbed
like
a
queen
at
some
public
ceremony
the
next
time
we
called
upon
george
eliot
she
had
heard
of
our
meeting
with
tennyson
and
said
so
you
have
seen
the
great
man
and
did
he
talk
talk
answered
my
husband
he
talked
the
whole
time
and
was
in
high
spirits
then
you
were
most
fortunate
we
understood
what
was
implied
for
tennyson
had
the
reputation
of
not
being
always
gracious
however
we
had
learned
from
himself
that
nothing
short
of
rudeness
could
keep
his
intrusive
admirers
at
a
distance
so
as
to
allow
him
some
privacy
he
told
us
of
a
man
who
so
dogged
his
steps
that
he
was
afraid
of
going
out
of
his
own
garden
gates
for
even
in
front
of
those
locked
gates
the
man
would
stand
and
pry
for
hours
together
till
the
poet
son
was
sent
to
him
with
a
request
that
he
would
go
elsewhere
in
the
case
of
his
meeting
with
hamerton
it
was
totally
different
for
he
had
himself
expressed
a
wish
for
it
to
woolner
of
course
my
husband
was
greatly
flattered
when
he
heard
of
it
and
readily
accepted
an
invitation
to
lunch
with
woolner
family
and
to
meet
the
poet
whom
he
so
much
admired
i
sat
by
tennyson
and
endeavored
to
suppress
any
outward
sign
of
the
interest
and
admiration
so
distasteful
to
him
nevertheless
i
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
dignity
of
his
simple
manners
and
by
the
inscrutable
expression
of
the
eyes
so
keen
and
yet
so
calm
so
profound
yet
so
serene
his
was
a
fine
and
noble
face
even
in
merriment
and
he
was
very
merry
on
that
day
for
the
string
of
humorous
anecdotes
he
told
kept
us
all
laughing
himself
included
i
am
sorry
now
not
to
remember
them
the
more
so
as
they
generally
concerned
himself
several
were
connected
with
his
title
of
lord
of
the
manor
but
the
only
one
i
can
remember
in
its
entirety
is
the
following
because
he
was
addressing
himself
to
me
a
frenchwoman
the
scene
of
the
story
being
the
h√¥tel
du
louvre
in
paris
tennyson
began
by
remarking
that
there
were
a
good
many
stories
current
about
him
some
of
them
were
true
but
most
of
them
apocryphal
and
is
the
one
you
are
going
to
relate
true
i
asked
he
smiled
and
answered
i
think
it
is
capital
you
will
have
to
guess
i
had
occasion
to
go
to
paris
with
a
friend
who
was
supposed
to
speak
french
creditably
and
who
fancied
himself
a
master
of
it
on
the
morning
following
our
arrival
in
the
french
capital
being
somewhat
knocked
up
by
the
journey
we
had
a
late
breakfast
at
a
small
of
the
of
which
we
were
soon
the
only
occupants
under
the
watchful
and
as
i
thought
suspicious
eyes
of
a
waiter
whose
attention
had
probably
been
attracted
by
the
conspicuous
difference
between
our
stature
and
garb
from
that
of
his
little
dandified
countrymen
having
caught
a
slight
cold
on
the
passage
i
felt
more
inclined
to
stay
by
the
fire
with
a
newspaper
than
to
go
out
and
did
so
whilst
my
friend
who
had
some
business
in
the
town
left
me
for
some
time
as
i
drew
my
chair
up
to
the
hearth
i
heard
the
waiter
answering
with
alacrity
to
some
recommendation
of
my
friend
monsieur
peut
√™tre
tranquille
veillerai
i
thought
it
was
some
order
about
our
dinner
and
resumed
my
political
studies
was
it
my
cold
which
made
me
dull
and
inattentive
it
is
quite
possible
for
my
eyes
kept
wandering
from
my
paper
and
strange
to
say
always
met
those
of
the
french
waiter
riveted
upon
me
at
first
i
felt
annoyed
what
could
be
so
strange
about
my
person
then
i
was
irritated
for
though
that
queer
little
man
was
making
some
pretence
at
dusting
or
replacing
chairs
still
his
eyes
never
left
me
for
a
moment
and
at
last
being
somewhat
drowsy
i
had
the
sensation
that
one
experiences
in
a
nightmare
and
thought
i
had
better
resort
to
my
room
and
make
up
for
a
shortened
night
no
sooner
however
had
i
got
up
from
my
chair
than
the
waiter
was
entreating
me
to
remain
offering
to
heap
coals
on
the
fire
to
bring
me
another
paper
or
a
pillow
if
i
was
tired
and
i
wish
to
write
a
letter
he
would
fetch
instantly
what
was
required
or
should
i
like
something
hot
for
my
cold
his
voice
had
the
strange
coaxing
tone
that
we
use
to
pacify
children
and
made
me
stare
but
i
answered
angrily
that
i
only
wanted
a
nap
and
to
be
let
alone
and
i
made
for
the
door
in
spite
of
his
objurgations
then
he
ran
in
front
of
me
and
barring
the
door
with
arms
outstretched
besought
me
to
await
my
friend
this
unaccountable
behavior
had
rendered
me
furious
and
now
i
was
determined
to
force
my
way
out
despite
the
mad
resistance
and
loud
gibberish
of
the
waiter
and
i
began
to
use
my
fists
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
tremendous
row
that
my
astonished
friend
in
the
and
was
greeted
with
this
exclamation
from
my
adversary
monsieur
vous
voyez
tenu
ma
parole
je
ne
pas
laiss√©
sortir
fou
mais
√ßa
pas
√©t√©
sans
peine
il
√©tait
temps
que
vous
arriviez
it
turned
out
that
my
friend
anxious
for
my
comfort
and
noticing
that
the
fire
was
getting
low
had
said
in
his
easy
french
before
leaving
surtout
ne
laissez
pas
sortir
le
fou
meaning
let
the
fire
go
out
and
the
intelligent
foreigner
had
immediately
guessed
from
my
appearance
that
i
was
amidst
general
laughter
i
said
it
is
cleverly
invented
i
see
you
do
not
believe
it
tennyson
answered
yet
it
has
passed
current
in
society
and
in
the
newspapers
sitting
close
to
tennyson
as
i
did
i
noticed
the
large
size
and
somehow
plebeian
shape
of
his
hands
they
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
the
same
body
as
the
head
indicating
merely
physical
strength
and
fitness
for
physical
labor
his
dress
also
struck
me
as
peculiar
he
was
wearing
a
shirt
of
coarse
linen
starchless
with
a
large
and
loose
collar
very
like
a
farmer
of
former
days
and
shirt
and
hands
looked
suited
to
each
other
after
remarking
this
i
happened
to
look
up
into
tennyson
face
which
then
wore
its
habitual
expression
of
serious
and
grand
simplicity
and
i
thought
that
the
rough
and
dull
linen
with
the
natural
unstiffened
fall
about
the
neck
formed
a
most
artistic
sculpturesque
setting
for
the
handsome
head
well
poised
above
it
after
lunch
woolner
took
the
gentlemen
to
his
studio
for
a
smoke
and
my
husband
told
me
afterwards
that
tennyson
had
continued
as
talkative
there
as
he
had
been
at
lunch
and
was
only
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
sir
bartle
frere
who
had
a
great
deal
to
say
on
his
own
account
it
was
very
gratifying
to
me
to
notice
that
whenever
my
husband
met
with
celebrities
he
was
treated
by
them
on
a
footing
of
equality
and
although
still
a
young
man
his
opinions
and
views
were
always
accepted
or
discussed
with
evident
respect
even
by
his
seniors
his
presence
invariably
awoke
interest
and
confidence
and
in
most
cases
sympathy
it
was
felt
that
he
was
one
of
the
few
to
be
looked
up
to
and
i
have
heard
people
much
older
than
himself
tell
me
that
they
prized
highly
a
private
hour
spent
with
him
because
his
influence
made
them
feel
more
desirous
of
striving
for
noble
aims
and
elevated
thoughts
which
seemed
so
natural
and
easy
to
him
it
is
true
indeed
that
whatever
he
thought
said
or
did
bore
the
stamp
of
genuine
uprightness
for
his
nature
was
so
much
above
meanness
of
any
kind
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
admitting
it
in
others
whenever
he
met
with
it
his
first
attitude
was
one
of
charitable
hesitation
but
when
he
recognized
it
unmistakably
his
indignation
was
as
unbounded
and
unrestrained
as
in
cases
of
cruelty
in
spite
of
the
impediment
to
social
intercourse
caused
by
his
intermittent
nervous
state
hamerton
enjoyed
rather
a
large
share
of
cultivated
and
intelligent
society
at
this
time
his
worst
moments
happened
in
the
morning
and
in
bright
sunshine
the
evening
was
in
general
entirely
free
from
disagreeable
sensations
and
a
rainy
day
or
clouded
sky
most
favorable
this
peculiarity
enabled
him
to
accept
invitations
to
dinners
at
which
he
met
the
persons
whose
acquaintance
he
cared
for
thomas
hamerton
and
his
sister
had
left
us
at
kew
to
go
back
home
and
we
wished
it
were
as
simple
for
us
to
do
the
same
but
we
could
only
think
of
the
journey
with
the
saddest
forebodings
yet
we
longed
to
be
through
it
and
safely
restored
to
our
peaceful
rustic
life
and
to
a
sight
of
our
children
it
was
a
very
tedious
trying
and
harassing
journey
we
travelled
only
at
night
by
the
slowest
trains
and
went
but
short
distances
at
a
time
sometimes
my
husband
was
unable
to
proceed
for
a
few
days
but
with
admirable
courage
and
resolution
he
managed
to
reach
the
goal
and
now
what
was
to
be
done
haden
allowed
literary
work
only
on
two
consecutive
days
in
the
week
and
when
gilbert
was
unwell
on
those
days
there
was
no
remunerative
production
and
his
anxieties
became
almost
intolerable
he
resolved
to
try
every
day
of
the
week
if
he
were
fit
for
work
and
to
go
on
whenever
he
felt
suitably
disposed
till
the
two
work
had
been
done
and
then
to
leave
off
till
the
next
week
this
succeeded
for
a
while
but
as
he
naturally
became
anxious
to
produce
as
much
as
possible
during
these
two
days
he
felt
driven
and
suffered
in
consequence
he
then
attempted
to
devote
only
two
hours
to
literary
composition
at
a
sitting
and
to
repeat
the
attempt
twice
a
day
when
he
did
not
feel
his
powers
overtaxed
to
this
new
rule
he
adhered
till
the
end
of
his
life
at
least
generally
speaking
for
in
some
circumstances
he
had
to
write
throughout
the
day
but
he
was
careful
to
avoid
this
extremity
as
much
as
possible
we
waited
impatiently
for
news
of
the
reception
of
etching
and
etchers
by
the
public
and
craik
having
been
so
kind
as
to
offer
any
service
she
could
render
i
wrote
to
her
on
the
subject
and
she
answered
beckenham
my
dear
hamerton
i
can
quite
understand
how
care
about
the
book
perhaps
more
than
your
husband
even
and
i
wish
i
could
send
you
news
of
it
but
there
have
been
no
reviews
as
yet
and
this
being
the
dull
time
of
year
the
sale
is
slow
whatever
reviews
come
out
you
shall
have
without
fail
from
the
firm
it
is
so
valuable
and
charming
a
book
that
i
do
hope
it
may
gradually
make
its
way
i
do
believe
it
is
only
the
dreadful
cities
which
make
your
husband
ill
and
no
wonder
in
peaceful
autun
he
will
flourish
i
trust
and
you
too
recover
yourself
for
i
am
sure
you
were
very
far
from
well
when
you
were
here
it
was
so
kind
of
you
to
come
to
us
that
sunday
and
to
believe
that
we
are
both
people
who
really
mean
what
we
say
and
say
what
we
think
which
all
the
world
does
not
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
pray
write
and
some
day
in
future
ages
i
shall
write
to
you
to
ask
advice
upon
our
little
tour
in
unknown
french
towns
and
country
when
we
shall
certainly
drop
upon
autun
not
this
year
however
with
very
kind
remembrance
to
you
both
believe
me
dear
hamerton
yours
sincerely
m
craik
my
sister
caroline
pelletier
had
now
come
to
with
her
to
escape
from
the
drought
prevailing
at
algiers
and
her
presence
was
a
great
pleasure
to
my
recluse
she
often
read
to
him
to
keep
up
her
english
and
accompanied
him
in
his
drives
when
i
was
prevented
aware
that
he
did
not
much
like
to
venture
away
alone
since
he
had
been
at
his
request
she
had
brought
an
algerian
necklace
and
bracelets
made
of
hardened
paste
of
roses
which
were
intended
for
aunt
susan
who
had
greatly
liked
the
odor
of
mine
and
who
acknowledged
the
little
present
in
a
very
cordial
letter
my
younger
brother
fr√©d√©ric
was
at
that
moment
very
ill
with
typhoid
fever
and
i
had
asked
my
husband
to
let
me
go
to
help
my
mother
in
nursing
him
however
with
greater
wisdom
and
firmness
he
refused
his
leave
and
made
me
understand
my
duty
to
our
children
if
you
brought
back
to
them
the
germs
of
disease
and
if
they
died
of
it
you
never
would
forgive
yourself
he
said
but
after
the
fatal
ending
he
allowed
me
to
attend
the
funeral
on
condition
that
i
should
not
enter
the
house
but
come
back
directly
after
the
painful
duty
was
accomplished
at
the
same
time
he
kindly
invited
my
mother
to
come
to
us
after
taking
all
necessary
precautions
against
the
danger
of
bringing
infection
to
her
grandchildren
the
society
of
pelletier
who
used
to
follow
his
wife
to
as
soon
as
he
was
free
proved
quite
a
boon
to
gilbert
in
his
solitude
and
a
solid
friendship
was
soon
formed
between
the
two
pelletier
mind
was
inquisitive
and
receptive
he
had
read
much
and
in
the
family
circle
we
called
him
our
encyclopedia
he
made
it
his
duty
and
pleasure
to
clear
up
any
obscure
point
which
might
embarrass
any
of
us
and
often
undertook
long
researches
to
spare
my
time
they
regularly
sat
up
together
long
after
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
had
gone
to
their
rest
talking
and
smoking
or
walking
out
in
the
refreshing
breeze
of
the
summer
night
my
brother
charles
also
joined
us
at
times
and
being
a
capital
swimmer
taught
his
nephews
all
sorts
of
wonderful
aquatic
feats
we
all
went
daily
to
the
pond
at
varolles
and
though
the
men
and
boys
were
all
proficient
in
swimming
charles
astonished
them
by
taking
a
header
preceded
by
a
double
somersault
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
kindling
thereby
a
jealous
desire
to
rival
him
so
that
in
a
very
short
time
my
husband
who
hitherto
had
remained
but
an
indifferent
performer
now
trod
the
water
read
aloud
or
smoked
in
it
with
the
greatest
ease
it
was
very
good
exercise
for
him
for
some
time
past
hamerton
reputation
had
been
growing
in
america
but
he
did
not
derive
the
slightest
profit
from
the
sale
of
his
books
there
till
roberts
brothers
of
boston
proposed
to
pay
him
a
royalty
upon
the
works
that
should
be
published
by
them
in
advance
of
pirated
editions
this
offer
was
accepted
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
and
the
pecuniary
result
though
not
very
important
proved
a
timely
help
moreover
roberts
brothers
admired
hamerton
talent
and
in
very
flattering
terms
acknowledged
it
besides
doing
much
for
the
spread
of
his
reputation
in
america
in
the
autumn
bad
news
of
aunt
susan
health
reached
the
reports
soon
became
alarming
and
her
nephew
was
made
very
miserable
by
the
impossibility
of
going
to
her
bedside
when
we
had
taken
leave
of
each
other
at
kew
she
was
very
despondent
on
account
of
my
illness
and
expressed
a
fear
that
she
might
die
without
our
being
near
her
no
one
could
say
when
the
taboo
on
railway
travelling
could
be
withdrawn
for
him
but
i
gave
our
aunt
a
solemn
promise
that
in
such
an
emergency
as
she
mentioned
i
at
any
rate
would
go
to
her
when
she
called
me
and
gilbert
had
ratified
the
engagement
from
her
letters
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
wished
very
much
for
my
companionship
and
nursing
being
very
low
in
spirits
and
feeble
in
body
yet
she
was
reluctant
to
ask
with
the
knowledge
that
her
nephew
also
frequently
required
my
care
at
last
we
agreed
that
the
proposal
should
come
from
us
my
husband
as
usual
sacrificing
his
own
comfort
to
the
claims
of
affection
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
as
i
had
never
travelled
much
alone
and
am
entirely
destitute
of
the
gift
of
topography
it
was
not
without
misgivings
that
my
husband
saw
me
off
but
he
had
taken
the
trouble
of
writing
down
for
my
guidance
the
minutest
directions
and
though
he
told
his
uncle
that
he
should
not
be
astonished
to
hear
that
i
had
turned
up
in
new
york
i
reached
london
safely
he
was
very
lonely
at
with
only
his
little
girl
and
a
maid
the
boys
being
at
college
but
he
frequently
went
to
dine
there
with
the
principal
schmitt
from
whom
he
needed
no
invitation
and
who
always
made
him
welcome
he
was
also
cheered
by
my
letters
which
told
him
of
his
aunt
rapid
improvement
in
health
and
strength
we
went
out
together
upon
the
hills
as
often
as
the
weather
allowed
and
when
threatened
with
an
attack
of
nervous
dizziness
which
she
dreaded
unspeakably
she
derived
confidence
from
my
apparent
composure
and
tided
over
it
when
i
firmly
grasped
her
round
the
waist
and
made
her
take
a
few
steps
in
the
keener
and
purer
air
of
the
garden
when
our
aunt
was
restored
to
her
usual
state
of
health
rather
more
than
a
month
after
my
arrival
i
took
leave
of
my
kind
relatives
loaded
with
presents
for
every
one
of
the
children
and
even
for
their
parents
of
course
i
wished
to
spend
christmas
at
home
and
i
arrived
just
in
time
to
realize
my
wish
gilbert
had
come
to
meet
me
at
the
station
and
as
soon
as
we
had
exchanged
greetings
and
news
he
began
to
tell
of
a
plan
for
an
artistic
periodical
which
had
mainly
occupied
his
thoughts
during
my
absence
as
we
were
driving
home
he
entered
into
all
the
details
of
the
scheme
as
he
conceived
it
and
said
he
believed
he
might
undertake
the
management
of
such
a
periodical
even
where
he
was
situated
if
seeley
gave
his
valuable
help
he
was
full
of
the
idea
and
his
thoughts
were
continually
reverting
to
it
chapter
x
wenderholme
the
mont
bouvray
botanical
studies
la
tuilerie
commencement
of
the
portfolio
the
war
the
uncertainty
of
finding
sufficient
literary
work
after
the
resignation
of
his
post
on
the
saturday
review
had
been
a
cause
of
great
anxiety
to
hamerton
though
he
had
enough
on
hand
at
that
time
but
he
wondered
very
much
if
it
would
last
he
wrote
for
the
globe
regularly
for
the
saturday
review
pall
mall
gazette
and
atlantic
monthly
occasionally
though
he
had
a
great
dislike
for
anonymous
writing
as
he
bestowed
as
much
care
and
labor
upon
it
as
if
it
could
have
added
to
his
reputation
he
worked
with
greater
pleasure
and
some
anticipation
of
success
at
his
novel
of
wenderholme
the
first
volume
of
which
had
been
sent
to
blackwood
who
agreed
to
give
for
the
copyright
here
are
some
passages
from
his
letter
which
of
course
was
very
welcome
after
a
few
criticisms
the
narrative
is
natural
and
taking
your
description
of
the
drunken
habits
of
shayton
are
and
not
a
bit
overdone
it
reminds
me
of
a
joke
of
aytoun
when
there
was
a
report
of
an
earthquake
at
a
village
in
scotland
notorious
for
its
convivial
habits
he
remarked
the
whole
inhabitants
are
in
a
chronic
state
of
that
would
have
shaken
down
the
walls
of
jericho
the
picture
of
poor
isaac
struggles
and
his
final
at
his
own
home
is
very
well
done
and
so
is
that
of
his
old
mother
with
her
narrow
fat
forehead
i
particularly
like
colonel
stanburne
he
like
a
gentleman
and
i
hope
he
has
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
story
little
jacob
is
very
nice
and
promises
to
make
a
good
hero
the
style
is
throughout
pleasant
and
graceful
i
shall
look
anxiously
for
vols
and
but
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
not
write
anything
unkind
or
inconsistent
with
good
taste
encouraged
by
the
favorable
opinion
of
blackwood
the
author
went
on
as
diligently
with
the
novel
as
his
health
allowed
from
time
to
time
i
find
in
his
diary
too
unwell
to
work
or
obliged
to
rest
or
not
well
enough
to
write
still
he
was
remarkably
free
from
bodily
pain
as
it
is
generally
felt
and
understood
he
never
complained
of
aches
or
sickness
and
to
any
ordinary
observer
he
looked
vigorous
and
unusually
healthy
but
from
me
accustomed
to
scrutinize
the
most
transient
expression
of
his
face
and
countenance
he
could
not
hide
the
slightest
symptoms
of
nervousness
were
it
merely
the
bending
forward
of
the
body
the
steady
gaze
or
unwonted
cold
brightness
of
the
eyes
whenever
i
detected
any
of
these
threatening
signs
at
home
i
begged
him
to
leave
work
and
to
go
out
and
if
we
happened
to
be
in
an
exhibition
or
any
crowded
place
we
had
to
resort
to
some
secluded
spot
in
a
public
garden
to
the
parks
if
we
were
in
london
and
i
believe
it
must
be
on
account
of
the
repeated
anguish
i
suffered
there
that
i
never
wished
to
visit
them
for
my
pleasure
those
horribly
painful
hours
have
deprived
them
of
all
charm
for
me
what
my
husband
had
to
bear
was
a
terrible
apprehension
of
something
fearful
he
did
not
know
what
now
increasing
as
if
a
fatal
end
were
inevitable
now
decreasing
only
to
return
ah
how
many
times
till
sometimes
only
after
hours
of
strife
and
sometimes
suddenly
it
left
him
calm
but
always
weakened
at
the
very
time
that
he
was
most
frequently
subject
to
these
attacks
the
american
papers
were
giving
numerous
notices
of
his
works
and
brief
biographies
in
which
he
was
invariably
presented
to
the
public
as
an
athlete
in
possession
of
the
most
robust
health
the
doctors
agreed
in
saying
that
this
disorder
was
only
nervous
and
not
the
result
of
any
known
disease
that
the
only
remedy
lay
in
rest
for
the
brain
and
active
exercise
for
the
body
in
the
open
air
but
it
was
indeed
difficult
to
give
rest
to
a
mind
incessantly
thirsting
for
knowledge
and
finding
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
interest
in
the
most
trivial
events
in
the
simplest
natures
and
the
monotonous
existence
of
the
rustics
as
well
as
in
the
philosophy
of
auguste
comte
and
john
stuart
mill
or
in
the
aesthetics
of
ruskin
and
charles
blanc
it
was
a
mind
which
turned
all
that
came
in
its
way
into
the
gold
of
knowledge
and
which
spent
it
generously
afterwards
not
only
in
his
writings
but
in
familiar
conversations
his
friends
used
to
say
that
they
always
gained
something
when
with
him
on
account
of
the
natural
elevation
of
mind
which
made
him
treat
all
questions
intellectually
he
had
no
taste
for
sport
or
amusements
or
games
with
the
exception
of
boating
and
chess
but
can
hardly
be
called
mental
rest
and
boating
is
not
always
practicable
requiring
several
hours
each
time
it
is
indulged
in
particularly
when
one
is
not
close
to
a
lake
or
river
riding
cocote
was
a
pleasant
relaxation
to
her
master
as
she
was
a
spirited
little
creature
and
the
two
often
went
together
to
the
mont
beuvray
the
site
of
the
ancient
bibracte
of
the
gauls
to
find
the
learned
and
venerable
president
of
the
soci√©t√©
eduenne
busy
with
his
researches
among
the
ruins
but
nevertheless
always
ready
to
receive
them
hospitably
the
use
of
one
of
his
huts
was
given
to
his
young
friend
and
his
companion
was
turned
loose
to
browse
on
the
fine
short
grass
which
grew
thickly
under
the
shade
of
the
noble
oaks
and
chestnut
trees
of
the
mountain
on
these
occasions
a
valise
containing
sketching
material
and
books
was
strapped
on
behind
the
rider
on
the
horse
back
at
other
times
when
i
accompanied
my
husband
we
went
in
a
light
cart
which
was
left
with
cocote
at
a
farmhouse
about
up
the
hill
my
husband
liked
me
to
read
to
him
whilst
he
sketched
and
i
see
by
his
diary
of
that
some
of
the
works
he
listened
to
in
the
course
of
that
year
were

by

greatly
admired
the

and
drives
which
he
took
in

of
picturesque
subjects
inclined
him
to
botanical
studies
and
he
began
to
form
a

the
search
for
plants
gave
a
zest
to
the
long
walks
recommended
by
the
doctors
which
might
have
become
tedious
had
they

mind
was
also
inventive
the
reader
may
have
remarked
in
the
autobiography
that
he
had
made
various
models
of
the
principle
of
which
he
wished
to
see
more
generally
adopted
on
account
of
their
safety
but
in
it
was
not
with
boats
that
this
faculty
of
invention
was
busy
it
was
with
a
plan
for
a
carriage
which
would
meet
our
requirements
the
little
was
so
rickety
now
that
it
had
become
unsafe
and
the
could
not
show
anything
sufficiently
convenient
of
a
size
and
weight
to
suit
cocote
the
elegant
curves
above
the
reduced
the
stowage
room
to
a
mere
nothing
and
we
required
plenty
of
space
to
carry
safely
protected
from
rain
and
dust
many
things
amongst
them
change
of
garments
when
we
went
to
autun
for
a
wedding
a
funeral
or
a
soir√©e
and
plenty
of
wraps
for
the
drive
back
in
the
cold
or
mist
of
midnight
a
good
deal
of
room
was
also
wanted
for
the
provisions
regularly
fetched
from
the
town
grocery
ironmongery
etc
my
husband
succeeded
in
contriving
a
carriage
perfectly
answering
our
wants
it
was
and
provided
with
a
double
seat
covering
a
roomy
well
there
was
also
a
considerable
space
behind
to
receive
bundles
and
parcels
or
at
will
a
small
removable
seat
six
persons
could
thus
ride
comfortably
in
the
carriage
and
as
we
were
expecting
a
visit
from
hamerton
and
his
sister
we
wished
very
much
to
have
it
ready
for
their
use
with
the
tender
thoughtfulness
which
characterized
my
husband
he
had
contrived
a
low
step
and
a
door
at
the
back
part
of
the
carriage
to
allow
an
aged
person
like
his
aunt
or
my
mother
to
get
inside
with
ease
and
safety
and
to
get
out
quite
as
easily
in
case
of
danger
they
arrived
in
the
middle
of
july
and
spent
a
month
with
us
they
were
both
in
very
good
health
and
aunt
susan
in
spite
of
her
seventy
years
rivalled
her
little
with
the
she
wrote
afterwards
from
west
lodge
on
august
my
dear
nephew
and
niece
we
arrived
at
home
all
safe
and
well
at
five
on
monday
to
tea
and
it
is
a
week
since
we
left
your
most
kind
and
hospitable
entertainment
and
i
can
assure
you
a
most
true
heartfelt
pleasure
and
gratification
it
has
been
to
me
to
spend
a
month
with
you
for
which
you
must
accept
our
best
thanks
for
your
kindly
studied
attentions
and
exertions
to
make
our
visit
pleasant
i
am
sure
i
am
much
better
for
my
journey
i
feel
strong
and
more
vigorous
the
drives
in
the
little
carriage
were
no
doubt
the
very
thing
that
would
conduce
to
my
getting
strong
as
i
had
then
fresh
air
and
exercise
without
fatigue
there
follows
a
description
of
the
journey
according
to
a
careful
itinerary
prepared
by
her
nephew
how
is
little
lala
lal
a
lala
her
little
niece
who
was
always
singing
we
often
talk
of
her
interesting
ways
and
doings
and
i
often
wish
i
could
give
other
english
lessons
to
my
nephews
i
think
we
should
have
made
some
progress
as
both
sides
seemed
interested
in
their
business
shortly
after
the
departure
of
his
relatives
hamerton
was
informed
by
his
landlord
that
he
would
have
to
leave
the
little
house
and
garden
and
stream
he
liked
so
well
because
it
was
now
the
intention
of
the
proprietor
to
come
to
it
with
his
family
to
spend
the
vacations
he
was
offered
instead
another
house
on
the
same
estate
called
la
tuilerie
larger
and
more
convenient
but
a
thoroughly
maison
devoid
of
charm
and
picturesqueness
close
to
the
main
road
and
without
a
garden
moreover
in
an
inconceivable
state
of
dirtiness
and
dilapidation
i
felt
at
the
notion
of
removing
to
such
a
place
however
i
was
at
last
obliged
to
submit
to
fate
my
husband
though
very
disinclined
to
a
move
thought
that
since
it
could
not
be
avoided
it
was
as
well
to
make
it
as
easy
cheap
and
rapid
as
possible
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
time
and
his
health
prohibited
long
travels
in
search
of
a
new
abode
since
he
could
not
make
use
of
railways
we
went
as
far
in
the
neighborhood
of
as
cocote
could
take
us
in
a
day
in
different
directions
but
found
nothing
suitable
probably
because
we
did
not
wish
to
be
at
a
distance
from
the
college
which
would
prevent
the
boys
from
coming
home
as
they
had
been
accustomed
to
do
the
greater
space
and
conveniences
offered
at
la
tuilerie
were
a
temptation
to
my
husband
we
had
besides
two
entrances
a
large
kitchen
six
bedrooms
lots
of
closets
cupboards
and
an
immense
garret
all
over
the
first
floor
well
lighted
by
two
windows
and
paved
with
bricks
in
the
extensive
courtyard
was
a
set
of
consisting
of
a
gardener
cottage
cartshed
and
stable
for
six
horses
and
as
on
the
ground
belonging
to
the
house
there
had
formerly
existed
a
with
drying
sheds
there
was
ample
space
for
a
garden
after
removing
the
rubbish
which
still
covered
it
the
fact
is
that
circumstances
allowed
of
no
choice
and
we
had
to
resign
ourselves
to
the
inevitable
gilbert
saw
at
once
that
with
a
certain
outlay
and
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
he
could
make
la
tuilerie
not
only
tolerable
but
even
convenient
and
pleasant
though
i
doubted
it
and
he
explained
how
the
outbuilding
might
be
used
as
laundry
laboratory
and
carpenter
shop
there
being
three
rooms
of
different
sizes
in
it
and
what
a
gain
it
would
be
so
to
have
all
the
dirty
work
done
outside
the
house
another
attraction
was
the
good
views
from
all
the
windows
that
of
the
beuvray
with
the
plain
leading
to
it
the
amphitheatre
of
autun
with
the
intervening
wood
of
noble
trees
and
beyond
it
the
temple
of
janus
the
range
of
the
morvan
hills
the
fields
of
golden
wheat
and
waving
corn
and
the
pastures
which
looked
like
mysterious
lakes
in
the
moonlight
when
the
white
mist
rose
from
the
marshes
and
spread
all
over
their
surface
endlessly
as
it
seemed
he
promised
me
to
plan
out
a
garden
and
there
being
several
fine
trees
about
the
kiln
and
on
the
border
of
the
road
oaks
elders
elms
and
spindle
trees
he
said
he
would
contrive
to
keep
them
all
so
as
to
have
shade
from
the
beginning
and
to
give
the
new
garden
an
appearance
of
respectable
antiquity
the
workmen
were
set
at
once
to
their
task
of
repairing
painting
and
papering
and
though
my
husband
deprecated
both
the
time
spent
on
supervision
and
the
unavoidable
expense
for
the
landlord
under
pretext
that
the
rent
was
low
refused
to
contribute
to
the
repairs
which
he
called
was
unmistakably
elated
by
the
prospect
of
having
the
use
of
a
more
spacious
dwelling
for
he
very
easily
suffered
from
a
feeling
of
confinement
and
tried
to
get
rid
of
it
by
having
two
small
huts
which
could
be
moved
about
to
different
parts
of
the
estate
according
to
his
convenience
and
to
which
he
resorted
when
so
inclined
even
when
they
were
not
used
it
was
for
him
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
he
had
in
readiness
a
refuge
away
from
the
house
whenever
he
chose
to
seek
it
this
dislike
to
confinement
was
betrayed
unconsciously
when
he
sat
down
to
his
meals
by
his
first
movement
which
pushed
aside
whatever
seemed
his
plate
glass
etc
i
remember
that
he
would
not
use
the
public
baths
in
france
because
the
cabins
are
small
and
generally
locked
on
the
outside
it
was
therefore
a
great
pleasure
to
devise
stands
and
cupboards
and
shelves
in
the
large
room
which
was
to
be
his
laboratory
and
which
he
adorned
with
a
cheap
frieze
of
white
paper
with
gilt
edges
and
lose
no
time
in
letters
repeated
upon
each
of
the
four
walls
so
as
not
to
escape
notice
whichever
way
you
turned
the
carpenter
shop
also
had
its
due
share
of
attention
and
was
well
provided
with
labelled
boxes
of
all
dimensions
for
nails
screws
whilst
a
roomy
closet
opening
into
the
studio
was
fitted
up
with
a
piece
of
furniture
specially
designed
to
receive
the
portfolios
containing
engravings
etchings
and
studies
of
all
kinds
together
with
a
lot
of
to
keep
small
things
separate
and
in
order
all
this
was
done
at
home
under
his
direction
and
he
has
let
his
readers
into
the
secret
of
his
taste
when
he
wrote
in
wenderholme
for
the
present
we
must
leave
him
captain
eureton
in
the
tranquil
happiness
of
devising
desks
and
with
bettison
an
intelligent
joiner
at
sooty
thorn
which
few
occupations
can
be
more
about
the
a
friend
of
my
husband
once
made
a
discovery
which
he
declared
astounding
i
well
knew
that
hamerton
was
a
model
of
order
he
said
to
me
but
i
only
knew
to
what
extent
when
having
to
seek
for
string
i
was
directed
to
these
i
easily
found
the
one
labelled
but
what
it
contained
was
too
coarse
for
my
purpose
above
said
hamerton
i
did
and
sure
enough
i
saw
another
label
with
thin
i
thought
it
wonderful
yes
gilbert
order
and
strove
to
keep
it
but
as
it
generally
happened
that
he
had
to
do
many
things
in
a
hurry
catching
the
post
for
instance
he
could
not
always
find
time
to
replace
what
he
had
used
when
this
had
gone
on
so
as
to
produce
real
disorder
he
gave
a
day
to
restoring
each
item
to
its
proper
place
this
happened
generally
after
a
long
search
for
a
mislaid
paper
the
finding
of
which
evoked
the
confession
i
love
order
better
than
she
loves
me
as
byron
said
of
wisdom
the
correspondence
relating
to
the
foundation
of
the
portfolio
was
now
very
heavy
everything
had
to
be
decided
between
seeley
and
hamerton
suitable
contributors
had
to
be
found
subjects
discussed
illustrations
chosen
the
only
english
art
magazine
of
that
day
confined
its
illustrations
to
line
engravings
and
woodcuts
and
its
plates
were
almost
always
engraved
from
pictures
or
statues
it
was
intended
that
the
portfolio
should
make
use
of
all
new
methods
of
illustration
and
should
publish
drawings
and
studies
as
well
as
finished
works
but
it
was
the
dearest
wish
of
the
editor
that
the
revived
art
of
etching
should
receive
due
appreciation
in
england
and
that
with
this
object
etched
plates
should
be
made
a
feature
of
the
new
magazine
the
contents
of
the
first
volume
will
best
show
the
plan
which
was
quite
unlike
that
of
any
existing
periodical
a
series
of
articles
on
english
artists
of
the
present
day
was
contributed
by
sidney
colvin
rossetti
tom
taylor
beavington
atkinson
and
the
editor
these
were
illustrated
by
drawings
most
willingly
lent
by
watts
poynter
sir
calderon
marks
leslie
and
other
painters
and
by
paintings
by
lord
leighton
armitage
and
newton
the
reproductions
were
made
by
the
autotype
or
carbon
process
of
photography
which
was
then
coming
into
high
estimation
as
a
means
of
making
permanent
copies
of
works
by
the
great
masters
every
copy
of
these
illustrations
was
printed
by
light
a
process
only
possible
in
the
infancy
of
a
magazine
which
could
count
at
first
on
the
interest
of
but
a
small
circle
and
had
to
form
its
own
public
the
editor
contributed
a
series
of
papers
entitled

the

its
bold

fine
thick
paper

the
pleasure

accomplished

the
public

of

extending

years
the

pages
in
appeared
one
of
stevenson
first
contributions
to
literature
if
not
his
first
a
paper
on
roads
signed
s
stoneven
this
was
followed
by
other
articles
in
the
years
and
bearing
his
own
name
the
fear
of
running
short
of
work
was
not
realized
on
the
contrary
my
husband
had
always
too
much
on
his
hands
for
he
dreaded
hurry
and
would
have
liked
to
bestow
upon
each
of
his
works
as
much
time
as
he
thought
necessary
not
only
for
its
completion
but
also
for
its
preparation
and
that
was
often
considerable
because
he
could
not
slight
a
thing
when
he
was
writing
for
the
globe
he
polished
his
articles
as
much
as
a
book
destined
to
last
he
always
respected
his
work
and
the
care
given
to
it
bore
no
relation
to
the
price
it
was
to
fetch
he
often
expressed
a
wish
that
he
might
labor
like
the
monks
in
the
middle
ages
without
being
disturbed
by
mercenary
considerations
that
simple
shelter
food
and
raiment
should
be
provided
for
himself
and
for
those
dependent
upon
him
he
did
not
foresee
any
other
wants
so
that
he
might
devote
the
whole
of
his
mental
energy
to
subjects
worthy
of
it
but
i
used
to
answer
that
if
he
had
such
liberty
he
never
would
publish
anything
for
whenever
he
sent
to
the
printer
it
was
inevitably
with
regret
at
not
being
able
to
keep
it
longer
for
improvement
still
the
second
volume
of
wenderholme
had
been
sent
to
blackwood
who
wrote
on
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
liked
vol
very
much
the
story
is
told
in
a
simple
way
which
is
very
effective
by
giving
an
air
of
truth
to
the
narrative
the
fire
and
the
whole
scene
at
the
hall
is
powerfully
described
the
love
at
first
sight
is
well
put
and
the
militia
quarters
and
the
landlord
are
true
to
the
life
my
husband
read
to
me
the
of
the
novel
as
fast
as
he
wrote
it
and
i
was
afraid
that
some
of
the
original
characters
might
be
recognized
by
their
friends
being
so
graphically
described
however
he
believed
it
unlikely
people
seeing
and
judging
so
differently
from
each
other
in
the
summer
as
usual
we
had
several
visitors
who
afforded
varying
degrees
of
pleasure
a
strange
amongst
others
whose
blandishments
did
not
succeed
in
making
my
husband
acquiesce
in
her
desire
of
boarding
with
us
free
of
charge
in
return
for
the
english
lessons
she
would
give
to
our
children
she
resented
the
of
her
proposition
and
having
begged
to
look
at
the
studies
on
the
easel
feigned
to
hesitate
about
their
right
side
upwards
by
turning
them
up
and
down
several
times
and
retiring
a
few
steps
each
time
as
if
in
doubt
a
more
desirable
visit
was
that
of
lalanne
who
besides
his
talent
had
much
amiability
and
very
refined
manners
ever
after
he
remained
if
not
quite
an
intimate
friend
of
my
husband
at
least
more
than
an
acquaintance
and
whenever
they
had
a
chance
of
meeting
they
made
the
most
of
it
gilbert
after
one
of
these
meetings
a
at
lalanne
told
me
the
following
anecdote
some
one
asked
him
if
he
had
not
the
legion
and
being
answered
that
it
had
not
been
offered
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
not
offered
but
accord√©e
through
the
influence
of
some
important
personage
or
by
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
and
i
think
this
should
be
your
case
friend
went
on
for
you
have
rendered
and
are
still
rendering
such
great
service
to
french
art
and
to
french
artists
that
it
ought
to
be
acknowledged
as
you
do
not
seem
inclined
to
trouble
yourself
about
it
a
deputation
might
be
chosen
among
your
admirers
to
present
a
petition
to
that
effect
to
the
ministre
des
hamerton
having
replied
that
he
should
prize
the
distinction
only
if
it
were
spontaneously
conferred
lalanne
remarked
that
decorations
were
of
small
importance
and
asked
without
the
slightest
pride
do
you
know
that
i
am
one
of
the
most
of
civilians
no
well
then
i
will
show
you
my
decorations
then
ringing
the
bell
he
said
to
the
maid
who
answered
it
bring
the
box
of
decorations
please
it
was
a
box
and
when
opened
showed
on
a
velvet
tray
a
number
of
crosses
stars
rosettes
and
ribbons
of
different
sizes
and
hues
all
vying
in
brilliancy
and
splendor
the
first
tray
removed
just
such
another
was
displayed
equally
well
filled
and
lalanne
explained
that
having
given
lessons
to
the
sons
of
great
foreign
personages
they
had
generally
sent
him
as
a
token
of
regard
and
gratitude
some
kind
of
decoration
maybe
in
lieu
of
payment
at
the
end
of
wenderholme
was
published
and
the
first
number
of
the
portfolio
made
its
appearance
on
january
and
from
that
date
it
became
for
the
editor
an
undertaking
of
incessant
interest
to
the
maintenance
and
improvement
of
which
he
was
ever
ready
to
devote
himself
and
for
which
he
would
have
made
important
sacrifices
the
dedication
of
wenderholme
was
meant
for
aunt
susan
and
after
receiving
the
book
she
wrote
accept
my
most
sincere
and
highly
gratified
thanks
for
the
copy
of
your
novel
and
its
dedication
we
have
heard
that
the
times
and
the
yorkshire
post
had
each
favorable
articles
on
the
merits
of
your
novel
we
have
detected
nearly
every
character
even
those
that
take
other
forms
but
we
do
not
even
whisper
any
information
in
this
neighborhood
and
w
were
immediately
struck
with
the
and
of
the
doctor
but
i
pretend
to
think
it
not
individual
but
that
it
was
the
case
among
the
people
you
were
writing
about
in
may
hamerton
removed
to
la
tuilerie
about
five
hundred
yards
from
he
continued
to
date
his
letters
from
the
new
house
being
on
the
estate
so
called
his
motive
was
to
avoid
possible
confusion
in
the
delivery
of
his
letters
he
was
greatly
tickled
to
hear
the
peasants
call
his
new
abode
le
ch√¢teau
de
and
to
see
them
staring
admiringly
from
the
road
at
the
windows
which
were
left
open
that
paint
and
plaster
might
dry
before
we
came
to
live
in
it
though
perfectly
independent
of
luxury
my
husband
liked
cleanliness
and
taste
in
the
arrangement
of
the
simplest
materials
and
he
contrived
by
a
good
choice
of
patterns
and
colors
in
the
papering
of
the
rooms
with
the
help
of
fresh
matting
on
the
floors
and
the
judicious
hanging
of
fine
engravings
and
etchings
in
his
possession
to
impart
quite
a
new
and
pleasant
aspect
to
the
maison
gradually
i
became
reconciled
to
it
on
account
of
its
greater
convenience
and
i
even
came
to
like
it
when
the
vines
and
wisteria
and
golden
nasturtiums
hid
the
ugly
bare
walls
and
the
fragrance
of
mignonette
and
roses
and
petunias
was
wafted
into
the
rooms
looking
over
the
garden
and
that
of
wild
thyme
and
honeysuckle
into
those
which
looked
over
the
fields
when
the
tall
acacias
began
to
shoot
upwards
straight
and
graceful
from
their
velvety
green
carpet
and
scattered
upon
it
their
perfumed
flowers
while
we
listened
to
the
humming
of
the
happy
bees
in
the
lime
trees
and
to
the
wondrous
song
of
the
rival
nightingales
challenging
each
other
from
bower
to
bower
in
the
calm
warm
nights
of
and
such
a
great
change
did
not
take
very
long
to
realize
the
ground
had
been
well
drained
and
plentifully
manured
and
it
was
almost
virgin
soil
unexhausted
by
previous
vegetation
so
that
the
was
soon
thickly
leaved
and
with
difficulty
prevented
from
closing
up
the
climbing
vines
became
heavy
with
grapes
whilst
the
spreading
branches
of
the
acacias
speedily
formed
a
vast
parasol
and
afforded
a
pleasant
shelter
from
the
glare
of
the
august
sunshine
hardy
fruit
trees
of
all
kinds
had
been
planted
all
along
the
garden
hedge
and
in
the
third
year
began
to
yield
cherries
in
moderation
but
plums
of
different
species
we
had
in
great
quantities
also
quinces
sometimes
apples
apricots
and
figs
the
two
last
however
were
frequently
destroyed
by
frost
the
spring
being
generally
very
cold
in
the
morvan
as
to
pears
we
had
to
wait
somewhat
longer
for
them
the
pear
trees
requiring
strict
pruning
to
preserve
the
quality
of
the
fruit
but
we
used
to
have
a
small
of
them
when
the
year
had
been
favorable
there
was
nothing
my
husband
liked
better
than
to
pick
gooseberries
currants
raspberries
cherries
or
plums
and
eat
them
fresh
as
we
took
a
walk
in
the
garden
he
was
very
fond
of
fruit
and
unlike
most
men
he
would
rather
do
without
meat
than
without
vegetables
or
dessert
his
tastes
in
food
as
in
everything
else
were
very
simple
but
he
was
particular
about
i
never
heard
him
complain
of
insufficiency
though
situated
as
we
were
there
was
sometimes
only
just
enough
and
even
that
lacking
which
might
have
been
considered
as
most
necessary
namely
a
dish
of
meat
for
gilbert
however
it
was
not
a
privation
when
occurring
occasionally
nay
he
even
enjoyed
the
change
and
as
i
generally
went
to
autun
on
fridays
and
could
get
fish
we
made
it
a
though
not
from
religious
motives
it
was
understood
that
if
eggs
were
served
they
must
be
newly
laid
if
potatoes
mealy
and
if
fish
fresh
and
palatable
he
would
not
have
tolerated
the
economy
of
one
of
our
lady
neighbors
who
abstained
from
buying
fish
at
autun
because
it
was
too
dear
she
said
but
who
used
to
bring
a
full
hamper
when
she
came
back
yearly
from
hy√®res
where
it
was
cheap
enough
to
last
for
a
week
the
and
who
considered
the
unsavory
hamper
an
ample
compensation
for
the
absence
of
fish
from
her
menus
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
removal
did
not
hinder
or
interrupt
hamerton
seriously
in
his
work
for
the
new
house
was
quite
ready
to
receive
the
furniture
and
the
place
of
every
piece
having
been
decided
beforehand
the
farmers
merely
handed
them
out
of
their
carts
to
the
workmen
who
carried
them
inside
the
rooms
according
to
previous
directions
the
difficulty
of
getting
proofs
of
the
different
states
of
his
plates
whilst
etching
them
incited
my
husband
to
invent
a
press
for
his
own
laboratory
that
he
might
judge
of
his
work
in
progress
by
taking
proofs
for
himself
whenever
he
liked
considering
the
present
state
of
our
affairs
i
was
not
favorable
to
the
idea
but
i
was
overruled
as
in
all
cases
concerning
expenses
deemed
necessary
to
artistic
or
literary
pursuits
he
had
few
material
wants
and
therefore
thought
himself
justified
in
providing
for
his
intellectual
needs
for
instance
by
the
gradual
formation
of
a
library
he
often
deprecated
the
necessity
of
apparent
extravagance
in
such
things
but
you
see
he
would
say
i
can
not
stand
stationary
in
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
if
i
am
to
go
on
teaching
others
i
must
keep
ahead
without
mentioning
the
satisfaction
of
my
own
tastes
and
cravings
to
which
i
have
a
certain
right
indeed
it
was
truly
wonderful
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
achieve
so
much
work
and
work
of
such
quality
in
the
intellectual
solitude
and
retirement
of
these
seven
years
passed
out
of
great
cities
where
libraries
museums
and
human
intercourse
constantly
offer
help
and
stimulus
to
a
writer
luckily
for
him
he
bore
solitude
well
he
has
said
in
the
intellectual
life
woe
unto
him
that
is
never
alone
and
can
not
bear
to
be
alone
and
again
only
in
solitude
do
we
learn
our
inmost
nature
and
its
needs
further
on
there
is
there
is
a
strength
that
comes
to
us
in
solitude
from
that
shadowy
awful
presence
that
frivolous
crowds
repel
he
often
sought
communion
with
that
awful
presence
in
the
thick
forests
of
the
morvan
and
on
the
highest
peak
of
the
mont
beuvray
and
found
it
for
some
time
our
minds
had
been
disturbed
by
the
unsettled
aspect
of
french
politics
and
the
possibility
of
a
war
with
prussia
had
been
a
cause
of
great
personal
anxiety
to
my
husband
on
account
of
his
nationality
he
has
related
in
round
my
house
how
the
news
of
the
declaration
of
war
reached
us
on
a
sunday
as
we
were
bringing
the
children
home
after
spending
the
day
peacefully
in
the
fields
and
on
the
of
a
picturesque
little
village
it
is
probable
that
if
my
husband
had
been
able
to
bear
a
long
railway
journey
we
might
have
accepted
the
hospitality
so
kindly
offered
in
the
following
letter
west
lodge
my
very
dear
nephew
and
niece
i
am
most
grievously
and
fearfully
concerned
to
hear
of
your
sad
condition
in
consequence
of
the
terrible
and
needless
war
that
is
now
spreading
misery
desolation
and
perhaps
famine
all
over
the
empire
just
to
gratify
the
unbounded
ambition
of
one
man
we
wish
you
and
your
three
children
could
fly
over
to
us
and
be
in
safety
really
if
you
get
at
all
alarmed
do
not
hesitate
to
come
all
of
you
with
as
much
of
your
property
as
you
can
pack
and
bring
we
can
and
shall
be
pleased
to
find
you
refuge
from
any
pending
evil
you
may
be
dreading
dear
you
would
find
your
articles
about
the
state
of
your
country
had
got
copied
into
the
courier
but
we
wish
to
caution
you
about
what
you
put
in
them
remember
whose
iron
heart
could
punish
you
and
what
would
become
of
your
wife
and
family
if
you
were
cast
into
prison
the
little
grandson
and
his
nurse
are
coming
here
on
tuesday
next
for
a
month
they
will
only
occupy
one
bedroom
so
there
will
still
be
the
best
bedroom
and
a
very
good
attic
and
half
of
my
bed
if
little
mary
susan
marguerite
dares
trust
herself
with
me
although
hamerton
had
always
taken
great
interest
in
politics
he
never
wished
to
play
an
active
part
in
them
from
time
to
time
he
wrote
a
political
article
about
some
cause
he
had
at
heart
or
some
wrong
which
he
wished
to
see
redressed
or
again
on
some
obscure
point
which
his
experience
of
two
countries
might
help
to
clear
up
but
he
never
consented
to
supply
regular
political
correspondence
to
any
newspaper
having
had
rather
a
lengthened
connection
with
the
globe
he
was
offered
the
post
of
which
he
declined
he
has
passed
over
many
interesting
incidents
of
this
wartime
in
round
my
house
although
he
has
given
a
few
one
of
the
most
striking
was
certainly
his
guiding
a
garibaldian
column
across
the
bed
of
the
river
ternin
on
a
bitterly
cold
day
mounted
on
his
spirited
little
cocote
who
showed
quite
a
martial
mettle
and
may
well
have
felt
proud
of
leading
a
number
of
great
cavalry
horses
she
took
no
harm
from
her
cold
bath
but
her
master
whose
legs
had
been
in
the
icy
water
on
account
of
her
small
height
up
to
the
thighs
was
not
so
fortunate
he
caught
a
serious
chill
accompanied
with
fever
and
pains
which
confined
him
to
the
house
over
a
week
he
mentions
in
the
book
our
anxiety
when
the
spy
mania
was
at
its
height
and
the
workmen
had
almost
decided
to
attack
us
in
a
body
but
he
refrains
from
detailing
how
day
after
day
when
the
hands
congregated
in
the
village
inns
after
dinner
in
the
twilight
we
used
to
take
our
children
by
the
hand
and
pass
with
hearts
in
anguish
for
their
safety
but
with
as
confident
a
countenance
as
we
could
command
before
their
infuriated
groups
never
knowing
whether
some
fatal
blow
would
not
be
dealt
from
the
next
group
or
the
one
following
the
men
stood
on
the
or
in
the
very
middle
of
the
road
awaiting
us
with
lowering
brows
and
sullen
looks
of
suspicion
when
with
sinking
hearts
and
placid
faces
we
stopped
to
say
a
few
words
to
one
of
our
enemies
to
whom
we
had
formerly
rendered
some
help
in
illness
or
destitution
the
truth
is
they
generally
looked
somewhat
ashamed
on
such
occasions
and
always
answered
politely
but
without
the
frank
and
pleased
looks
of
other
days
when
they
were
proud
of
our
notice
and
interest
they
would
rather
have
done
without
it
now
especially
in
the
company
of
their
against
our
safety
i
dare
say
the
innocent
unconcern
of
our
children
who
laughed
and
played
freely
in
their
happy
ignorance
of
danger
proved
our
best
safeguard
but
still
every
night
after
reaching
home
we
could
not
help
thinking
how
will
it
be
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
hostilities
my
husband
had
deprecated
the
rashness
of
the
french
people
which
was
blinding
them
to
the
unprepared
state
of
their
army
and
to
its
numerical
inferiority
when
compared
with
the
german
force
but
when
he
saw
that
although
the
king
of
prussia
had
said
that
the
war
was
not
directed
against
the
french
people
he
was
still
carrying
it
on
unmercifully
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
his
sympathies
with
the
invaded
nation
grew
warmer
every
day
and
he
did
all
that
was
in
his
power
to
spare
from
invasion
that
part
of
the
country
where
we
lived
and
which
we
knew
so
well
he
put
himself
in
communication
with
general
bordone
garibaldi
garibaldi
himself
being
very
ill
at
that
time
and
explained
how
autun
might
be
surprised
by
roads
which
had
been
left
totally
unguarded
he
made
a
careful
map
of
the
country
about
us
for
garibaldi
and
shortly
after
outposts
were
placed
according
to
his
directions
so
as
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
reaching
autun
by
these
parts
without
resistance
he
used
to
go
to
autun
with
cocote
almost
every
night
for
news
and
met
there
with
garibaldian
officers
whom
he
often
drove
to
inspect
the
outposts
and
they
gave
him
the
password
for
the
sentinels
on
his
way
home
one
night
however
he
had
remained
even
later
than
usual
having
taken
an
officer
to
a
very
distant
outpost
and
when
he
reached
the
road
leading
to
la
tuilerie
the
password
had
been
changed
and
he
was
detained
in
spite
of
all
he
could
say
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
on
his
way
he
would
have
submitted
easily
to
the
discomfort
of
a
few
hours
in
the
had
it
not
been
that
he
realized
how
anxious
i
must
be
and
when
he
heard
the
order
of
march
given
to
a
patrol
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
join
it
as
it
was
going
his
way
observing
that
the
soldiers
would
have
the
power
of
shooting
him
if
he
attempted
to
run
away
the
permission
was
granted
and
he
set
off
on
foot
in
the
midst
of
the
patrol
followed
by
his
dog
cocote
having
been
left
at
the
inn
it
was
freezing
hard
and
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
ground
the
march
was
a
silent
one
the
men
having
been
forbidden
to
talk
and
it
was
a
miracle
that
gilbert
dog
escaped
with
its
life
for
every
time
it
barked
or
growled
it
was
threatened
with
instant
death
his
master
however
artfully
represented
that
in
case
enemies
were
hidden
in
the
ditches
or
behind
the
hedges
bordering
the
road
tom
would
soon
dislodge
them
and
help
in
their
capture
this
seemed
to
pacify
the
men
together
with
the
prospect
no
less
artfully
held
out
of
a
glass
of
rum
each
when
they
reached
la
tuilerie
it
was
a
weary
march
for
gilbert
and
an
anxious
watch
for
me
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
joyful
bark
of
our
dog
announcing
his
return
i
hastened
downstairs
and
made
a
great
blaze
for
the
patrol
and
its
prisoner
and
served
to
them
all
some
hot
grog
which
was
duly
appreciated
i
have
no
doubt
it
seemed
hard
to
the
poor
soldiers
to
leave
the
seats
by
the
leaping
flames
to
resume
their
slippery
march
in
the
creaking
snow
but
they
did
it
promptly
enough
somewhat
cheered
by
the
renewed
warmth
they
were
carrying
away
with
them
hamerton
has
described
in
round
my
house
how
he
watched
the
battle
which
took
place
at
autun
from
our
garret
window
with
the
naked
eye
we
could
only
see
the
dark
lines
of
soldiers
without
being
able
to
follow
their
strategical
movements
but
to
my
husband
with
the
help
of
his
telescope
every
incident
was
instantly
revealed
and
he
communicated
them
to
us
in
succession
as
they
occurred
it
is
needless
to
say
what
a
relief
we
experienced
when
we
heard
that
the
enemy
was
falling
back
ever
so
slightly
then
every
one
of
us
women
and
children
wanted
to
look
through
the
telescope
and
for
once
i
see
in
it
and
hailed
with
heartfelt
thanksgivings
the
scarcely
perceptible
retreating
movement
of
the
germans
at
that
moment
the
light
of
day
was
fading
fast
and
in
the
twilight
i
could
just
see
my
husband
turning
towards
our
awestruck
children
and
saying
to
them
i
am
certain
that
you
will
never
forget
this
day
and
what
a
horrible
thing
a
war
is
and
they
answered
oh
never
despite
these
painful
preoccupations
hamerton
had
prepared
the
etcher
handbook
and
its
illustrations
and
was
writing
a
series
of
articles
on
the
characters
of
balzac
for
the
saturday
review
to
save
time
i
read
to
him
le
p√®re
goriot
eug√©nie
grandet
ursule
mirouet
les
parents
pauvres
la
cousine
bette
etc
harwood
approved
of
the
series
but
although
my
husband
admired
balzac
talent
greatly
he
disliked
the
choice
of
his
subjects
in
general
and
complained
to
me
of
the
desponding
state
of
mind
they
produced
in
him
he
called
it
withering
sometimes
in
consequence
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
not
a
good
study
mentally
for
him
and
rightly
abandoned
the
series
for
it
was
of
importance
that
he
should
be
in
the
healthiest
mental
condition
to
write
the
intellectual
life
the
form
of
which
was
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
he
had
already
begun
it
twice
over
and
each
time
had
read
to
me
the
preliminary
chapters
without
giving
to
my
expectant
interest
entire
satisfaction
he
had
had
the
plan
of
the
book
in
contemplation
for
years
and
the
gathered
materials
were
rich
and
ready
but
the
definite
form
had
not
yet
been
found
he
was
in
no
way
discouraged
by
repeated
failures
and
told
me
he
was
sure
to
grasp
it
sometime
only
he
grew
excited
in
the
struggle
the
prudent
rule
which
forbade
work
at
night
had
been
cast
aside
and
it
was
about
two
in
the
morning
when
i
was
awakened
to
listen
to
the
first
chapters
of
the
intellectual
life
as
they
now
remain
i
was
very
happy
to
be
able
to
praise
them
unreservedly
hitherto
my
part
had
been
but
a
sorry
one
i
could
only
say
i
do
think
this
is
the
best
possible
form
without
suggesting
what
the
best
form
ought
to
be
but
now
i
felt
sure
it
answered
exactly
to
my
expectations
and
my
husband
rejoiced
that
he
had
hit
it
at
last
chapter
xi
letters
of
peter
graham
r
incidents
of
the
war
the
intellectual
life
the
etcher
handbook
an
american
clergyman
mr
powers
after
reading
hamerton
works
had
become
one
of
his
most
fervent
admirers
and
there
came
to
be
a
regular
correspondence
between
them
mr
powers
used
to
gather
all
the
information
he
could
about
the
progress
of
his
friend
reputation
in
the
united
states
newspaper
articles
criticisms
encomiums
notes
and
to
send
them
to
he
was
a
great
deal
more
sensitive
to
strictures
on
my
husband
than
the
victim
himself
and
i
see
in
the
of
this
entry
april
powers
to
console
his
mind
about
the
article
on
me
now
mr
powers
longed
to
see
some
pictures
from
the
hand
of
hamerton
and
had
so
often
expressed
this
wish
that
the
artist
out
of
gratitude
for
the
constant
interest
shown
in
his
work
rashly
promised
to
paint
two
landscapes
as
a
present
it
was
very
characteristic
that
he
did
not
promise
one
only
but
two
and
at
a
time
when
he
was
so
overwhelmed
with
work
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
get
through
the
most
pressing
and
still
more
characteristic
is
this
other
entry
in
the
february
powers
sending
him
measures
of
his
pictures
so
that
he
may
get
frames
for
them
it
is
true
that
one
of
the
pictures
was
begun
but
before
it
was
brought
to
completion
several
years
were
to
elapse
though
the
pictures
were
both
at
intervals
on
the
easel
always
undergoing
some
change
either
of
effect
or
of
composition
even
of
subject
for
the
painter
could
never
be
satisfied
with
them
he
felt
that
he
lacked
the
power
of
expressing
himself
and
said
to
me
these
are
not
my
pictures
i
them
differently
whilst
when
he
had
seen
peter
spate
in
the
highlands
he
exclaimed
this
is
one
of
my
i
should
like
to
have
painted
it
entirely
devoid
of
the
false
pride
which
prevents
learning
from
others
he
had
written
to
peter
graham
about
what
he
considered
his
failures
and
had
received
the
following
reply
with
regard
to
what
you
say
of
yourself
in
your
last
letter
i
have
never
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
picture
of
yours
but
i
can
not
imagine
any
one
to
fail
in
landscape
who
has
the
high
qualifications
for
it
which
you
obviously
have
a
sensitively
impressionable
nature
a
strong
loving
admiration
for
whatever
in
heaven
or
earth
is
beautiful
or
grand
in
form
color
or
effect
then
you
have
the
faculty
of
observation
without
which
a
mind
however
sensitive
to
the
impressions
of
nature
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
will
be
passive
not
active
the
mechanical
difficulties
of
our
art
must
be
to
some
extent
overcome
before
our
thoughts
and
intentions
can
be
realized
and
our
impressions
conveyed
to
others
after
all
every
artist
feels
that
his
work
is
a
failure
the
success
of
rendering
what
he
wishes
is
so
exceedingly
limited
in
his
mind
i
am
talking
of
what
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
but
my
only
reason
is
that
you
spoke
of
yourself
as
failing
in
landscape
from
want
of
natural
ability
which
i
can
not
believe
my
method
of
getting
memoranda
which
you
inquire
about
is
to
study
as
closely
as
i
can
to
watch
and
observe
and
make
notes
and
drawings
also
studies
in
color
and
patient
groping
after
what
i
wish
to
learn
are
my
only
methods
i
feel
unable
to
enter
into
details
so
much
would
need
be
said
on
the
subject
i
believe
i
am
much
indebted
to
my
long
education
as
a
for
any
little
ability
i
may
have
in
rendering
the
material
of
nature
i
was
a
many
years
before
i
touched
landscape
continued
study
from
the
antique
and
painting
from
the
nude
in
a
give
or
ought
to
give
an
acquaintance
with
light
and
shadow
which
to
a
is
invaluable
nature
affects
our
feelings
so
much
in
landscape
by
light
and
shadow
in
edinburgh
we
had
a
long
gallery
with
windows
from
the
roof
at
intervals
and
the
statues
were
arranged
there
a
splendid
collection
i
shall
never
forget
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
middle
tint
or
overshadowing
which
the
statues
had
that
were
placed
between
the
windows
those
which
were
immediately
underneath
them
were
of
course
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
we
had
all
gradations
of
light
and
shadow
when
i
came
to
study
clouds
and
skies
i
recognized
the
enchantment
of
effect
to
be
caused
by
the
same
old
laws
of
light
i
had
tried
to
get
acquainted
with
at
the
academy
of
course
color
adds
immensely
to
the
difficulty
of
sky
painting
and
the
amount
of
groping
in
the
study
of
gray
blue
is
very
disheartening
i
need
not
longer
weary
you
however
on
this
subject
but
shall
just
again
say
that
i
really
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
succeed
in
if
such
be
your
wish
and
therefore
can
not
think
of
you
as
having
failed
then
in
a
subsequent
letter
i
find
this
passage
since
receiving
your
last
letter
i
have
read
and
with
great
pleasure
your
camp
in
the
highlands
i
am
stronger
than
ever
in
the
belief
that
it
is
merely
from
your
never
having
devoted
the
necessary
amount
of
time
to
art
in
the
right
direction
that
unqualified
success
has
not
been
attained
by
you
as
an
artist
i
think
it
unfortunate
that
you
painting
with
a
clever
you
probably
far
excelled
him
in
sympathy
with
nature
power
of
observation
and
all
the
gifts
especially
required
for
a
what
you
really
needed
study
under
a
or
better
still
at
an
academy
would
have
given
you
landscape
nature
is
too
complicated
to
be
a
good
school
to
acquire
the
mastery
over
the
mechanical
difficulties
in
art
i
do
agree
with
you
that
you
ought
to
have
filled
your
notebooks
with
memoranda
from
nature
instead
of
painting
pictures
at
loch
awe
your
experience
there
was
very
valuable
a
notebook
memorandum
from
nature
is
of
little
or
no
use
for
a
picture
in
oil
without
previous
study
of
similar
subjects
or
effects
in
the
same
vehicle
you
ask
my
opinion
of
your
present
method
of
study
i
think
it
excellent
and
would
make
only
two
suggestions
you
might
safely
discontinue
the
study
of
botany
and
dissection
of
plants
there
is
not
the
slightest
fear
of
a
want
of
truth
in
your
pictures
and
the
time
might
be
devoted
to
some
more
pressing
work
then
i
think
you
might
paint
the
human
figure
with
much
profit
even
to
and
writing
on
art
the
reader
may
have
remarked
that
hamerton
had
frequently
painted
from
a
model
at
though
not
from
the
nude
for
he
was
of
opinion
that
this
kind
of
study
was
no
great
help
to
him
at
this
stage
though
it
might
have
been
earlier
a
more
serious
impediment
than
technical
difficulties
soon
stopped
all
progress
with
mr
powers
pictures
it
was
a
recurrence
of
the
cerebral
excitement
almost
in
a
chronic
form
my
husband
had
made
a
plan
for
issuing
separately
proofs
of
the
etchings
appearing
in
the
portfolio
but
he
was
so
ill
that
he
could
not
hold
a
pen
and
to
explain
the
details
of
this
plan
to
seeley
i
acted
as
amanuensis
under
his
dictation
his
aunt
was
very
much
grieved
to
hear
of
this
illness
and
wrote
suppose
you
tried
a
ten
or
twenty
miles
journey
by
train
in
some
direction
whence
you
could
return
by
water
or
conveyance
if
necessary
i
assure
you
i
can
do
valiant
things
with
impunity
that
the
very
thinking
of
them
would
have
made
me
ill
about
thirteen
months
ago
he
did
not
need
courage
to
be
preached
to
him
he
had
a
sufficient
store
of
it
indeed
his
nervousness
had
nothing
to
do
with
fear
he
used
to
drive
or
ride
cocote
after
she
had
been
running
away
upsetting
the
carriage
and
breaking
the
harness
till
she
was
subdued
again
into
docility
once
at
dieppe
in
a
storm
he
had
volunteered
to
steer
a
lifeboat
which
was
making
for
a
ship
in
distress
but
his
services
had
been
refused
when
it
was
known
that
he
had
a
family
he
rode
fearlessly
one
of
the
high
dangerous
bicycles
of
that
time
about
which
aunt
susan
humorously
said
in
one
of
her
letters
that
they
often
prove
rather
restive
and
are
given
to
or
seized
with
an
inclination
to
butting
the
walls
and
also
of
lazily
lying
down
on
the
road
over
which
they
ought
to
be
almost
imperceptibly
passing
along
and
during
the
war
he
kindly
received
fed
and
helped
several
and
stray
french
soldiers
perfectly
aware
that
he
was
risking
his
life
in
case
the
prussians
came
near
he
even
conveyed
one
of
them
to
the
garibaldian
outposts
in
his
carriage
of
his
own
accord
he
attempted
time
after
time
to
get
the
better
of
this
peculiar
nervousness
but
it
had
lately
increased
to
such
a
point
that
for
a
time
when
we
reached
autun
in
the
carriage
and
came
of
the
railway
bridge
he
had
to
give
me
the
reins
jump
down
and
go
back
to
wait
for
my
return
outside
the
town
for
i
could
not
go
with
him
having
to
take
our
boys
to
the
college
i
never
knew
how
i
might
find
him
when
we
met
again
unlike
the
majority
of
patients
who
make
the
most
of
their
ailments
to
excite
sympathy
he
considerately
let
me
know
immediately
of
the
slightest
improvement
and
kept
repeating
it
will
soon
be
over
now
distress
yourself
i
believe
that
the
great
excitement
and
anxiety
of
the
wartime
had
caused
the
recurrence
of
the
ailment
and
no
wonder
for
we
knew
several
cases
of
mental
derangement
in
the
small
circle
of
our
acquaintances
even
amongst
peasants
who
are
far
from
imaginative
or
nervous
in
gilbert
case
there
were
only
too
many
reasons
for
anxiety
besides
the
uncertainty
of
his
situation
his
pelletier
then
√©conome
of
the
lyc√©e
at
vend√¥me
was
in
the
thick
of
the
strife
and
his
post
was
not
unattended
with
danger
though
the
lyc√©e
had
become
an
international
ambulance
it
was
sometimes
hard
for
him
to
restrain
his
indignation
before
the
insolence
and
partiality
of
the
victors
once
for
instance
he
appealed
to
the
general
in
command
to
obtain
for
the
french
wounded
an
equal
portion
of
the
bread
given
to
the
prussians
but
he
was
pushed
by
the
shoulder
to
an
open
window
from
which
the
french
army
could
be
seen
and
the
general
exclaimed
pointing
to
the
soldiers
in
the
distance
vous
rien
rien
tant
que
nous
ne
les
aurons
pas
battus
allez
another
time
pelletier
had
to
go
to
ch√¢teau
renaud
to
fetch
several
things
sorely
wanted
at
the
ambulance
it
was
forbidden
by
the
enemy
under
penalty
of
death
to
carry
any
letters
out
of
the
city
which
they
had
declared
in
a
state
of
siege
but
pelletier
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
refuse
a
few
from
desolate
mothers
and
wives
and
these
letters
were
carefully
sewn
up
at
night
by
his
wife
in
the
lining
of
his
overcoat
who
betrayed
him
no
one
knows
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
descend
the
stairs
some
one
rapidly
brushed
past
whispering
hurriedly
leave
that
coat
behind
he
understood
went
back
to
his
apartment
threw
the
coat
to
his
terrified
wife
merely
saying
burn
and
had
only
time
to
seize
another
hanging
in
the
passage
and
rush
to
the
omnibus
waiting
with
the
escort
he
was
however
stopped
by
a
prussian
officer
who
said
you
go
you
are
carrying
letters
and
you
know
that
you
have
put
yourself
in
the
way
of
being
shot
the
coat
was
taken
from
him
the
lining
cut
on
finding
nothing
the
officer
said
with
a
dry
smile
you
have
been
warned
but
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
you
might
not
escape
so
easily
another
time
my
brother
charles
despite
his
being
the
only
son
of
a
widow
and
de
had
been
enlisted
and
his
letters
did
not
always
reach
their
destination
though
his
regiment
was
at
chagny
not
far
from
autun
and
for
a
while
hamerton
had
lost
all
traces
of
his
madame
gindriez
had
gone
to
vend√¥me
to
be
near
her
younger
daughter
madame
pelletier
in
the
hope
of
keeping
clear
of
the
bloody
conflict
but
found
herself
in
the
very
centre
of
it
after
the
occupation
of
vend√¥me
by
prince
frederick
charles
and
was
thus
shut
off
from
all
news
of
her
son
after
vainly
attempting
to
get
a
during
the
hostilities
she
at
last
succeeded
after
the
armistice
and
left
the
town
to
go
to
tours
where
she
had
friends
willing
to
receive
her
and
where
she
expected
to
hear
from
her
son
the
omnibus
in
which
she
travelled
was
escorted
by
bismarck
white
cuirassiers
pistol
in
hand
till
it
reached
ch√¢teau
renaud
in
the
night
madame
gindriez
was
awakened
by
loud
rappings
at
her
bedroom
door
and
ordered
to
give
up
her
room
to
some
prussian
sergeants
who
had
come
back
from
an
expedition
she
dressed
quickly
and
went
to
the
kitchen
the
only
place
in
the
hotel
free
from
soldiers
to
await
the
morning
as
she
best
could
her
breakfast
was
served
upon
a
small
table
apart
from
the
long
one
in
the
centre
of
the
room
which
was
reserved
for
the
german
officers
they
were
very
much
elated
it
seemed
by
the
armistice
thinking
that
it
might
lead
ultimately
to
a
peace
for
which
they
openly
expressed
their
desire
ordering
champagne
clinking
their
glasses
together
and
politely
offering
one
to
madame
gindriez
with
the
words
you
refuse
to
drink
with
us
la
madame
√†
la
paix
soit
she
courageously
answered
mais
sans
cession
de
territoire
they
did
not
insist
it
may
be
easily
surmised
that
such
tidings
reaching
my
husband
from
time
to
time
kept
him
in
an
anxious
state
far
from
beneficial
to
his
health
after
the
armistice
i
find
a
great
many
entries
in
the
of
letters
inquiring
about
friends
and
how
they
had
fared
during
this
terrible
despite
this
chronic
state
of
anxiety
hamerton
was
writing
the
intellectual
life
and
had
offered
it
for
publication
in
america
to
roberts
brothers
they
answered
we
liked
the
title
and
the
plan
of
your
new
work
as
outlined
by
you
and
presuming
it
will
be
larger
than
about
art
we
will
give
you
fifty
pounds
outright
for
the
early
copy
or
we
shall
allow
you
a
percentage
on
it
after
the
first
thousand
are
sold
of
ten
per
cent
on
the
retail
price
provided
we
are
not
interfered
with
by
competing
editions
the
author
had
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
another
letter
from
roberts
brothers
dated
july
in
which
this
passage
occurs
about
art
is
quite
popular
you
have
many
very
dear
friends
in
this
country
and
the
number
is
increasing
in
september
of
the
same
year
haden
wrote
in
reference
to
the
projected
etcher
handbook
your
new
processes
interest
me
immensely
and
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
give
us
a
handbook
on
the
whole
subject
let
it
be
concise
and
even
dogmatic
for
you
have
to
speak
on
the
matter
and
people
prefer
to
be
told
what
to
do
to
being
reasoned
into
it
ever
anxious
to
improve
himself
my
husband
had
asked
lewes
to
advise
him
about
his
reading
preparatory
to
the
new
book
he
had
begun
to
write
on
the
intellectual
life
here
is
the
answer
the
priory
north
bank
regent
park
my
dear
hamerton
we
so
often
speak
of
you
and
your
wife
and
were
so
very
anxious
about
you
during
the
war
that
we
have
asked
right
and
left
for
news
of
you
and
were
delighted
at
last
to
get
such
good
news
of
you
both
as
to
the
books
to
be
suggested
for
your
work
partly
the
fact
that
no
one
can
really
suggest
food
for
another
partly
the
fact
that
i
clearly
understand
the
nature
of
your
work
these
perhaps
make
a
good
excuse
if
the
following
list
is
worthless
it
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
gather
together

the

you
no

references
as
to

best
works
under
each
head
we
did
not
go
abroad
this
year
but
buried
ourselves
in
absolute
solitude
in
surrey
near
haslemere
if
you
know
the
lovely
region
and
there
i
worked
like
a
man
going
in
for
the
senior
wranglership
and
lewes
who
was
ailing
most
of
the
time
went
on
with
her
new
work
this
work
by
the
way
is
a
panorama
of
provincial
life
to
be
published
in
eight
parts
on
alternative
months
making
four
very
thick
vols
when
complete
it
is
a
new
experiment
in
publishing
while
she
was
at
her
art
i
was
at
the
higher
mathematics
seduced
into
those
regions
by
some
considerations
affecting
my
personal
work
the
solitude
and
the
work
together
were
perfectly
blissful
except
tennyson
who
came
twice
to
read
his
poems
to
us
we
saw
no
one
no
sooner
did
we
return
home
than
lewes
who
had
been
incubating
an
attack
it
and
for
five
weeks
she
was
laid
up
getting
horribly
thin
and
weak
but
now
she
is
herself
again
thinner
self
and
at
work
she
begs
me
to
remember
her
most
kindly
to
you
and
to
hamerton
ever
yours
truly
h
lewes
almost
in
every
letter
that
my
husband
received
from
lewes
he
had
this
confirmation
of
what
george
eliot
had
told
him
about
the
heavy
penalty
in
health
attending
or
following
her
labors
lewes
had
not
mentioned
his
lives
of
goethe
and
aristotle
but
they
were
ordered
with
the
other
books
he
had
recommended
and
i
began
to
read
them
aloud
to
my
husband
whilst
he
was
etching
the
plates
for
an
illustrated
edition
of
the
painter
camp
that
he
had
always
hoped
to
see
accepted
by
macmillan
pelletier
had
been
promoted
from
vend√¥me
to
and
after
spending
a
month
of
the
vacation
at
our
house
with
his
wife
and
three
children
now
invited
his
host
and
family
to
go
back
with
him
for
the
remainder
of
the
holidays
however
the
boys
only
went
for
their
father
was
incapacitated
for
railway
travelling
and
the
little
girl
may
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
her
parents
even
to
go
with
her
cousins
and
her
aunt
caroline
whom
she
so
much
loved
the
nervous
state
into
which
my
husband
had
been
thrown
back
had
produced
a
morbid
sensitiveness
to
noise
and
to
the
sight
of
movement
which
isolated
him
more
and
more
even
from
his
nearest
friends
and
during
these
last
vacations
he
had
seldom
been
able
to
take
with
us
in
consequence
he
had
a
little
hut
erected
near
the
river
buisson
whither
he
retired
almost
daily
and
to
which
i
took
or
sent
him
his
lunch
there
he
read
wrote
or
sketched
surrounded
only
by
silent
and
motionless
objects
this
morbid
sensitiveness
decreased
with
the
light
of
day
and
when
the
sun
had
set
we
generally
joined
him
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
fading
slowly
into
twilight
in
the
summer
evenings
he
always
dined
with
us
all
and
after
dinner
he
either
listened
to
music
of
which
he
was
very
fond
or
even
played
a
little
himself
on
the
violin
or
walked
out
in
company
we
made
quite
a
little
procession
on
the
road
now
six
children
romping
about
my
sister
and
her
husband
my
mother
and
my
brother
charles
the
master
of
the
house
and
myself
and
since
it
had
transpired
that
my
husband
was
not
so
well
some
of
his
friends
at
autun
or
in
the
neighborhood
came
as
often
as
they
could
to
make
him
feel
less
out
of
the
world
he
has
said
himself
the
intellectual
life
is
sometimes
a
fearfully
solitary
one
unless
he
lives
in
a
great
capital
the
man
devoted
to
that
life
is
more
than
other
men
liable
to
suffer
from
isolation
to
feel
utterly
alone
beneath
the
deafness
of
space
and
the
silence
of
the
stars
give
him
one
friend
who
can
understand
him
who
will
not
leave
him
who
will
always
be
accessible
by
day
and
night
one
friend
one
kindly
listener
just
one
and
the
whole
universe
is
changed
in
his
case
the
friendly
and
intelligent
intercourse
kept
up
with
his
wife
relatives
alleviated
in
a
great
measure
the
sense
of
isolation
the
life
in
the
hut
together
with
the
botanical
studies
and
the
formation
of
the
herbarium
suggested
the
plan
of
the
sylvan
year
and
thereby
lent
additional
interest
to
these
pursuits
though
at
that
time
his
main
work
was
the
prosecution
of
the
intellectual
life
now
that
he
had
finished
the
correction
of
the
handbook
on
etching
footnote
contributed
to
the
portfolio
and
afterwards
published
separately
this
last
work
brought
him
many
pleasant
letters
from
brother
artists
but
i
shall
only
quote
what
samuel
palmer
said
about
it
because
it
was
his
praise
and
that
of
seymour
haden
which
gave
the
author
the
greatest
satisfaction
coming
from
authorities
on
the
subject
redhill
dear
hamerton
had
i
thanked
you
earlier
for
your
which
came
long
ago
i
could
not
have
thanked
you
so
much
for
it
is
the
test
of
good
books
as
of
good
pictures
that
they
improve
with
acquaintance
i
had
a
little
bound
with
brass
corners
that
i
might
carry
it
always
in
my
after
doing
this
for
twenty
years
it
was
all
the
fresher
for
its
portage
your
invention
of
the
positive
process
is
equally
useful
and
elegant
useful
because
the
reverse
method
lessens
the
pleasure
of
work
elegant
because
the
materials
are
delicate
and
the
process
cleanly
and
expeditious
in
this
letter
palmer
expressed
his
desire
to
publish
a
translation
of
virgil
eclogues
in
verse
and
asked
for
his
advice
about
it
another
source
of
satisfaction
to
gilbert
was
the
increasing
success
of
his
works
in
america
in
january
he
had
a
letter
from
roberts
brothers
in
which
they
said
we
have
mailed
you
a
copy
of
unknown
river
it
has
proved
a
success
and
has
been
generally
admired
it
is
a
charming
book
and
we
should
like
to
bring
out
a
popular
edition
about
art
is
selling
better
than
we
expected
it
has
given
a
start
to
the
camp
which
we
are
now
printing
a
second
edition
of
we
think
you
are
getting
to
be
well
known
and
appreciated
in
this
country
enclosed
in
the
letter
was
a
remittance
for
which
proves
that
an
author
has
need
of
a
good
many
successes
to
pay
his
way
still
these
remittances
from
america
made
a
difference
in
circumstances
and
were
exclusively
devoted
to
the
education
of
his
boys
though
unambitious
he
was
not
indifferent
to
the
increase
in
his
reputation
for
he
had
written
in
the
intellectual
life
fame
is
dearer
to
the
human
heart
than
wealth
itself
he
certainly
cared
infinitely
and
incomparably
more
for
his
reputation
such
as
he
wished
it
to
be
pure
dignified
and
honored

popularity

love

technical
sir
seymour
attempts
to
resume
the
dedication
of
the
intellectual
life
was
a
perfect
surprise
to
me
when
i
first
opened
my
presentation
copy
the
secret
had
been
well
kept
i
felt
grateful
and
honored
to
be
thus
publicly
associated
by
my
husband
in
his
work
though
my
share
had
been
but
humble
and
infinitesimal
more
sympathetic
than
active
more
encouraging
than
laborious
our
common
dream
had
been
to
be
as
little
separated
as
possible
and
he
had
attempted
soon
after
our
marriage
to
rouse
in
me
some
literary
ambition
and
to
direct
my
beginnings
i
first
reviewed
french
books
for
the
reader
and
he
was
kind
enough
to
correct
everything
i
wrote
then
he
induced
me
to
try
my
hand
at
a
short
novel
reminding
me
humorously
that
some
of
my
father
friends
used
to
call
me
little
bluestocking
he
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
a
publisher
for
my
second
novel
and
was
quite
disappointed
to
fail
he
wrote
to
encourage
me
to
persevere
the
reviews
of
your
first
novel
have
all
been
favorable
enough
but
the
publishers
told
me
they
had
published
a
novel
that
had
succeeded
and
that
they
had
now
made
up
their
minds
to
publish
another
no
matter
who
wrote
it
i
rather
think
they
would
publish
your
new
novel
but
i
earnestly
recommend
you
to
try
am
quite
you
have
something
in
you
but
you
want
wider
culture
better
reading
and
more
of
it
and
the
difficulty
about
household
matters
is
for
the
present
in
your
way
though
if
i
go
on
as
i
am
doing
now
we
will
get
you
out
of
that
a
copy
of
the
intellectual
life
was
sent
to
aunt
susan
who
received
it
just
as
she
was
going
to
visit
her
sister
hinde
whom
she
found
in
failing
health
and
who
died
shortly
after
it
was
a
new
grief
for
my
husband
to
whom
she
had
always
been
very
kind
as
soon
as
tranquillity
was
in
france
after
the
war
and
commune
hamerton
had
renewed
a
regular
correspondence
with
his
friends
and
being
greatly
interested
in
the
technique
of
the
fine
arts
consulted
those
friends
whose
experience
was
most
to
be
relied
upon
letters
are
full
of
explanation
about
his
own
practice
as
well
as
that
of
decamps
horace
vernet
delaroche
and
delacroix
in
one
of
them
i
find
this
interesting
passage
i
very
much
doubt
if
the
talent
of
coloring
can
be
i
think
it
is
a
gift
like
an
ear
for
music
which
if
not
born
with
you
can
never
be
perfectly
acquired
i
for
instance
am
could
never
have
tuned
a
violin
doubtless
if
the
faculty
exists
intuitively
it
may
be
perfected
or
at
all
events
much
improved
by
study
and
practice
but
he
that
has
it
not
from
birth
think
can
never
acquire
it
palmer
in
a
long
letter
also
devoted
to
the
technical
part
of
painting
and
etching
turns
to
literature
to
say
my
pleasure
in
hearing
of
the
success
of
intellectual
life
is
qualified
only
by
the
comparative
apathy
of
the
english
of
such
a
book
one
edition
here
to
three
in
america
is
something
to
be
ashamed
of
the
sale
of
the
book
was
rapid
both
in
england
and
in
america
but
the
american
sale
continued
to
be
incomparably
the
larger
as
early
as
february
roberts
brothers
wrote
intellectual
life
is
a
complete
literary
success
in
america
it
has
been
the
means
of
making
you
almost
a
household
god
in
the
most
refined
circles
we
are
now
selling
the
fifth
thousand
our
supply
of

footnote
contributed

and
afterwards
published
separately
is
all
sold
and
we
are
now
stereotyping
the
book
we
hope
to
sell
a
good
many
the
motive
which
prompted
my
husband
to
write
these
chapters
was
purely
his
love
and
pity
for
all
dumb
creatures
he
never
could
do
without
a
dog
and
the
dog
was
always
the
favorite
being
even
preferred
to
the
and
when
out
of
compassion
for
its
infirmities
it
had
to
be
out
of
pain
his
master
never
shirked
the
painful
duty
but
performed
it
himself
as
mercifully
as
he
could
one
of
his
dogs
which
had
long
been
treated
for
cancer
was
at
last
chloroformed
to
death
his
master
helping
the
veterinary
surgeon
all
the
time
another
who
became
suddenly
rabid
and
could
not
be
prevented
from
entering
the
house
to
the
imminent
peril
of
us
all
he
met
and
stunned
at
a
blow
with
a
log
of
wood
having
no
weapon
ready
poor
cocote
was
not
sold
when
she
became
useless
but
allowed
to
divide
her
old
age
peacefully
between
the
freedom
of
the
pasturage
and
the
comfort
and
plenty
of
the
stable
till
her
master
asked
the
best
shot
of
the
place
a
poacher
to
assist
him
in
firing
a
volley
which
quickly
put
an
end
to
her
life
as
she
was
unsuspectingly
coming
out
of
the
field
and
he
only
came
to
this
decision
when
we
left
the
country
out
of
love
or
pity
my
husband
was
interested
in
all
animals
and
i
believe
that
animals
were
instinctively
aware
of
it
dogs
always
sought
his
caresses
he
used
to
remove
his
toads
from
the
dangers
of
the
road
and
they
did
not
seem
afraid
he
never
was
stung
by
bees
though
he
often
placed
his
hand
flat
in
front
of
the
opening
in
the
hive
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
alight
upon
it
before
entering
of
the
rat
only
he
had
a
nervous
horror
but
it
remained
unconquerable
he
disliked
the
sight
of
one
and
if
he
met
one
accidentally
he
always
experienced
a
disagreeable
shock
when
he
tried
to
find
out
the
reason
he
was
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
the
disquieting
rapidity
and
restlessness
of
its
movements
in
hamerton
began
to
write
for
the
international
review
principally
on
the
fine
arts
and
continued
his
contributions
till
roberts
brothers
expressed
a
wish
that
he
would
reserve
the
publications
in
book
form
to
their
firm
which
had
done
so
much
for
his
reputation
at
the
beginning
of
april
he
heard
from
boston
that
they
were
printing
the
sixth
thousand
of
the
intellectual
life
and
had
written
to
macmillan
that
they
were
willing
to
unite
in
bringing
out
a
new
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
in
october
the
seventh
thousand
of
the
intellectual
life
was
being
printed
the
second
edition
of
chapters
on
animals
and
the
second
of
thoughts
about
art
were
about
half
gone
and
a
painter
camp
was
going
off
quite
freely
about
the
last
roberts
brothers
added
this
book
ought
to
sell
better
we
have
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
that
it
so
fascinated
us
that
we
ventured
to
republish
it
we
are
nature
lovers
and
delight
to
keep
the
company
of
one
who
loves
her
and
is
able
to
tell
of
it
as
you
can
of
course
we
cheered
aunt
susan
with
the
list
of
these
successes
and
she
answered
i
wish
my
dear
that
all
your
admirers
would
be
as
generous
with
their
money
as
they
are
with
their
flattery
for
flattery
is
not
a
commodity
to
supply
a
family
with
means
of
subsistence
in
the
same
letter
she
told
of
hinde
death
and
funeral
and
of
her
hopes
of
seeing
her
nephew
ben
hinde
succeed
to
his
father
living
early
in
hamerton
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
contributors
to
the
portfolio
sidney
colvin
who
now
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
editor
after
nursing
his
friend
stevenson
through
one
of
his
dangerous
attacks
of
illness
my
husband
esteemed
highly
knowledge
and
acquirements
during
his
short
stay
this
esteem
expanded
into
personal
regard
and
in
after
years
whenever
a
meeting
with
him
was
possible
it
invariably
afforded
gratification
in
the
summer
our
house
was
turned
into
a
sort
of
temporary
hospital
by
an
epidemic
of
measles
brought
to
it
by
the
boys
from
their
college
having
had
it
in
my
youth
i
luckily
was
spared
to
nurse
in
succession
the
three
children
and
my
husband
whose
case
was
by
far
the
most
serious
however
he
would
not
take
to
his
bed
but
remained
in
his
study
with
a
good
fire
at
night
sleeping
upon
an
ottoman
or
in
an
wrapped
up
in
his
monk
dress
and
the
head
covered
with
an
algerian
chechia
in
due
course
he
got
through
the
distemper
without
accident
but
for
fear
of
chills
he
continued
to
wear
the
chechia
and
monk
dress
in
the
house
some
time
after
his
recovery
and
he
was
so
discovered
by
and
mark
pattison
when
they
paid
us
an
unexpected
visit
it
happened
thus
i
had
driven
my
sister
and
her
youngest
boy
to
autun
where
he
had
been
invited
to
stay
a
few
days
at
his
godmother
and
as
we
alighted
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
i
was
told
that
an
english
gentleman
and
his
wife
had
ordered
an
omnibus
to
call
upon
hamerton
and
were
on
the
point
of
starting
on
learning
that
i
was
at
the
hotel
they
came
to
propose
that
i
should
go
back
to
la
tuilerie
with
them
which
proposition
i
accepted
with
pleasure
i
left
the
told
my
sister
that
i
would
fetch
her
in
the
evening
and
drove
off
with
and
pattison
the
latter
very
much
interested
by
what
i
could
point
out
to
her
on
the
way
the
temple
of
janus
the
roman
archways
the
double
walls
of
the
town
and
mont
beuvray
the
drive
from
autun
to
la
tuilerie
is
a
short
one
and
we
soon
arrived
at
the
garden
gate
as
we
stopped
the
study
window
was
quickly
almost
violently
thrown
open
my
husband
anxious
face
appeared
through
it
and
he
shouted
to
the
bewildered
coachman
what
has
happened
at
the
sight
of
an
omnibus
he
had
been
afraid
of
an
accident
not
at
all
unusual
with
cocote
tendency
to
take
fright
run
away
and
upset
carriage
and
all
and
had
fancied
me
hurt
and
brought
back
laid
upon
the
cushioned
seat
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
safe
and
sound
and
noticed
my
companions
he
hastened
down
to
receive
his
visitors
we
spent
the
afternoon
very
pleasantly
but
as
it
was
getting
cooler
and
a
little
damp
after
sunset
my
husband
who
was
not
fully
recovered
had
to
excuse
himself
from
accompanying
and
pattison
back
to
autun
and
to
let
me
go
instead
i
had
the
pleasure
of
a
second
meeting
with
them
on
the
following
morning
at
the
hotel
when
we
took
leave
of
each
other
i
have
always
remembered
an
incident
in
connection
with
this
visit
that
and
pattison
never
knew
of
there
had
been
in
our
entrance
hall
for
the
last
four
months
at
least
a
manuscript
notice
written
very
legibly
by
hamerton
and
carefully
pasted
up
with
his
own
hands
in
a
very
good
light
by
the
side
of
the
door
to
this
effect
english
visitors
to
this
house
are
earnestly
requested
not
to
stay
after
seven
if
not
invited
to
dine
and
when
invited
to
dine
not
to
consider
themselves
as
entitled
to
the
use
of
a
bedroom
unless
particularly
requested
to
remain
this
had
been
done
in
a
moment
of
legitimate
anger
and
vexation
of
course
without
consulting
me
and
i
had
thought
it
the
best
policy
to
ignore
it
for
some
time
particularly
during
winter
when
it
was
put
up
for
there
was
little
probability
of
english
visitors
at
that
time
as
to
french
visitors
it
was
unlikely
that
they
could
make
out
its
meaning
and
if
they
did
as
it
did
not
concern
them
they
would
consider
it
as
a
humorous
after
a
fortnight
however
i
begged
my
husband
to
remove
the
notice
but
his
anger
had
not
cooled
a
bit
and
he
said
in
a
tone
that
i
knew
to
admit
of
no
opposition
that
the
notice
was
meant
to
remain
there
and
there
it
remained
at
first
partially
and
by
degrees
almost
entirely
covered
up
by
the
shawls
or
mantles
that
i
artfully
spread
as
far
as
possible
over
the
obnoxious
manuscript
till
emboldened
by
and
under
pretext
that
the
about
the
door
was
soiled
i
got
leave
to
have
a
new
piece
hung
and
took
care
to
have
it
laid
the
notice
this
took
place
on
the
very
day
that
and
pattison
paid
their
friendly
visit
i
must
now
explain
the
cause
of
my
husband
temporary
ukase
as
i
have
said
before
bulliot
president
of
the
soci√©t√©
eduenne
was
a
friend
of
his
and
on
one
occasion
a
scotchman
having
applied
to
him
for
permission
to
see
a
precious
book
kept
in
the
archives
of
the
learned
society
bulliot
finding
him
and
interesting
took
the
trouble
of
bringing
him
to
la
tuilerie
in
the
hope
that
hamerton
and
w
would
derive
pleasure
from
the
meeting
it
was
so
and
w
researches
at
autun
requiring
a
few
days
only
he
was
invited
to
dinner
for
the
morrow
he
duly
arrived
and
dined
but
as
he
gave
no
sign
of
going
away
i
asked
him
a
little
before
ten
if
he
was
a
good
walker
as
the
hotels
at
autun
closed
at
eleven
he
merely
answered
no
matter
looking
already
like
an
old
man
and
weak
besides
i
felt
certain
that
he
could
not
possibly
reach
the
town
in
time
for
a
bed
and
i
quietly
retired
to
mine
my
husband
told
me
in
the
morning
that
he
had
shown
w
to
the
spare
room
unwilling
to
turn
an
old
man
out
in
the
cold
and
mist
of
an
early
morning
i
foresaw
a
repetition
of
what
had
happened
at
and
so
it
proved
for
w
quartered
himself
upon
us
for
two
days
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
longer
he
would
have
stayed
if
my
husband
had
not
at
last
insisted
peremptorily
on
driving
him
back
to
autun
on
reaching
home
gilbert
immediately
went
up
to
his
study
to
write
his
notice
to
english
visitors
and
without
saying
a
word
securely
pasted
it
up
at
the
entrance
a
few
days
later
he
heard
from
the
proprietor
of
the
h√≥tel
de
la
poste
that
before
leaving
w
had
said
hamerton
will
settle
the
bill
it
was
a
good
thing
for
my
husband
that
he
gave
so
much
consideration
to
the
bringing
up
of
his
children
for
indirectly
he
derived
from
it
some
benefit
to
his
own
health
for
instance
not
wishing
them
to
be
always
confined
to
college
he
used
often
to
drive
them
to
and
from
autun
and
in
the
summer
as
he
came
back
he
would
just
stop
the
pony
for
a
few
minutes
at
our
gate
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
the
family
and
a
hamper
then
take
us
to
a
cool
and
shady
dell
divided
from
a
little
wood
by
the
river
vesvre
the
coldest
water
i
ever
bathed
in
and
as
soon
as
cocote
was
taken
out
of
harness
and
left
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
fresh
grass
we
all
tumbled
into
the
icy
water
and
swam
till
our
appetites
were
thoroughly
sharpened
for
a
hearty
dinner
in
the
lingering
twilight
the
children
were
also
taken
by
their
father
to
the
hills
where
they
climbed
about
whilst
he
sketched
his
little
daughter
mary
liked
nothing
better
than
to
spend
a
day
au
pommoy
above
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
canche
where
the
parents
of
our
lived
they
were
farmers
in
a
very
humble
way
but
they
offered
us
heartily
the
little
they
possessed
the
eggs
the
clotted
cream
which
the
children
delighted
in
thickly
spread
upon
black
bread
and
which
the
mother
prepared
in
perfection
also
frothy
goat
milk
with
walnuts
and
chestnuts
in
their
season
cocote
too
had
free
access
to
the
dainty
grass
and
crystal
spring
of
their
pasturage
in
the
hollow
behind
the
cottage
whilst
my
husband
painted
and
i
read
to
him
we
watched
the
children
who
and
turned
up
the
stones
in
the
seeking
for
trout
and
crayfish
in
the
course
of
these
pleasant
excursions
gilbert
entered
into
conversation
with
every
one
he
met
farmers
shepherdesses
and
even
beggars
learning
what
he
could
of
their
lives
and
thoughts
sympathizing
with
their
labors
and
their
wants
often
conveying
useful
information
to
their
minds
frequently
on
politics
sometimes
on
geography
or
science
he
tried
to
explain
to
them
the
railways
and
telegraph
for
many
of
the
dwellers
in
these
hilly
regions
had
never
seen
a
railroad
especially
the
old
folk
who
could
no
longer
walk
any
great
distance
and
remembered
autun
only
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
diligences
he
liked
the
polite
deferential
manners
of
the
french
peasants
and
their
quiet
dignity
and
they
felt
at
ease
with
him
because
of
his
serious
interest
in
what
concerned
them
and
total
absence
of
pride
in
the
superiority
of
his
station
or
learning
wherever
he
went
he
liked
to
see
the
parish
church
and
generally
found
it
worth
his
while
either
artistically
or
historically
the
cure
was
frequently
to
be
met
with
and
not
sorry
to
talk
with
a
person
better
informed
than
most
of
his
parishioners
it
was
for
gilbert
another
field
to
glean
from
and
on
such
occasions
he
generally
managed
to
bring
home
a
sheaf
with
him
it
was
most
remarkable
to
see
how
well
he
got
on
with
the
roman
catholic
clergy
although
his
religious
opinions
were
never
hidden
from
them
and
his
attitude
by
no
means
conducive
to
hopes
of
conversion
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
not
aggressive
and
did
not
turn
into
ridicule
ceremonies
or
beliefs
to
which
he
remained
a
stranger
perfectly
firm
in
his
own
convictions
he
respected
those
of
other
people
because
his
large
sympathy
understood
the
different
wants
of
different
natures
even
when
he
had
no
share
in
them
he
was
always
on
visiting
terms
with
cur√©
the
one
officiating
at
tavernay
the
nearest
village
to
la
tuilerie
and
on
friendly
terms
with
the
aum√¥nier
de
and
the
aum√¥nier
de
coll√®ge
although
the
boys
were
not
under
his
spiritual
direction
their
father
considering
it
as
a
duty
to
let
them
choose
their
own
religion
when
they
were
of
age
later
on
antoine
professor
at
the
seminary
became
a
faithful
and
welcome
visitor
to
la
tuilerie
even
monseigneur
the
bishop
of
autun
gave
a
signal
proof
of
his
respect
for
hamerton
character
which
will
be
related
in
due
course
and
visited
him
afterwards
so
long
as
we
remained
in
the
autunois
the
technical
difficulties
of
painting
which
were
giving
my
husband
so
much
trouble
to
conquer
led
him
to
speak
not
unfrequently
of
the
advantages
formerly
afforded
to
students
by
the
privilege
of
working
in
the
same
studios
with
their
masters
and
even
of
having
some
portions
of
the
masters
pictures
to
execute
under
their
personal
and
invaluable
direction
he
realized
what
a
gain
it
would
be
not
only
for
beginners
but
even
for
artists
to
be
acquainted
with
the
best
methods
of
the
best
artists
and
at
last
counting
upon
their
generosity
he
resolved
to
make
a
general
appeal
to
their
experience
they
were
almost
unanimously
favorable
to
the
idea
and
furnished
valuable
notes
the
substance
of
which
was
published
in
the
portfolio
the
letters
are
too
technical
though
very
interesting
to
be
quoted
here
but
the
eminent
names
of
the
writers
will
be
a
proof
of
the
importance
attached
to
the
subject
i
find
those
of
sir
frederick
leighton
sir
john
gilbert
watts
holman
hunt
samuel
palmer
calderon
wyld
dobson
davis
storey
in
the
notes
still
in
my
possession
my
husband
was
himself
in
the
habit
of
making
experiments
in
painting
and
etching
though
he
deplored
both
the
time
and
money
so
spent
and
repeatedly
resolved
not
to
meddle
any
more
with
them
but
he
could
not
keep
the
resolution
his
mind
was
so
curious
about
all
possible
processes
and
technicalities
and
his
desire
of
perfection
so
great
that
not
only
did
he
experiment
in
all
the
known
processes
but
invented
new
ones
entries
in
the
like
the
following
are
of
frequent
occurrence
experiments
with
white
zinc
did
not
succeed
this
month
tried
sulphur
with
success
i
discovered
also
that
the
scraper
is
excellent
for
obtaining
various
breadths
of
line
in
the
background
i
made
a
successful
experiment
in
sandpaper
mezzotint
de
fontenay
and
i
made
very
cheaply
indeed
i
tried
experiments
on
grains
the
grains
given
by
the
sandpaper
and
rosin
that
given
by
the
fine
was
the
best
quite
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
all
experiments
in
view
of
typographic
drawings
here
is
an
important
entry
august
resolved
in
future
to
confine
myself
exclusively
to
and
etching
in
all
artistic
work
done
for
the
public
except
the
designs
for
the
bindings
of
my
books
which
may
be
done
in
resolved
also
that
there
shall
be
as
little
as
possible
of
copying
and
slavery
in
my
artistic
work
but
that
etching
shall
be
etching
and
painting
painting
he
had
been
working
very
hard
copying
etchings
for
the
new
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
and
was
thoroughly
tired
of
it
i
see
in
his
diary
finished
my
plate
after
rembrandt
will
never
undertake
a
set
of
copies
again
felt
it
a
great
deliverance
to
be
rid
of
plates
for
and
etchers
a
later
note
there
is
no
technical
difficulty
for
me
in
etching
i
ought
therefore
to
direct
my
energies
against
the
artistic
difficulties
of
composition
drawing
light
and
shade
haden
is
the
model
for
the
kind
of
work
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
do
in
etching
comprehensive
sketching
is
the
right
thing
meanwhile
our
boys
were
growing
and
giving
great
satisfaction
to
their
father
by
their
application
to
and
success
in
their
studies
they
always
kept
at
the
head
of
their
class
and
carried
off
a
great
number
of
prizes
at
the
end
of
every
scholastic
year
the
younger
boy
richard
evinced
an
early
taste
for
the
pictorial
arts
and
was
gifted
with
a
sure
critical
faculty
and
a
natural
talent
for
drawing
although
he
had
never
taken
regular
he
had
often
watched
his
father
at
work
had
occasionally
sketched
and
painted
under
his
direction
and
was
receiving
a
sort
of
artistic
education
by
what
he
saw
at
home
of
illustrated
periodicals
engravings
and
etchings
sent
for
presentation
or
criticism
he
was
early
tempted
to
try
etching
and
of
course
received
encouragement
and
help
the
first
attempt
was
a
success
as
far
as
it
went
and
palmer
wrote
about
it
your
son
etching
has
given
pleasure
to
other
than
eyes
a
sweet
little
etching
said
my
wife
who
saw
it
lying
on
the
table
is
like
an
old
master
there
is
something
touching
in
the
sight
of
a
beginner
full
of
curiosity
and
hope
my
yearning
is
that
he
may
escape
the
rocks
on
which
i
split
years
wasted
any
one
of
which
would
have
given
a
first
grounding
in
anatomy
indispensable
anatomy
to
have
gone
with
the
antique
the
bones
are
the
the
marrowless
bones
are
the
talisman
of
all
life
and
power
in
art
power
seems
to
depend
upon
knowledge
of
structure
all
surface
upon
substance
knowing
this
and
imbued
with
the
central
essence
we
may
venture
to
copy
the
appearance
perhaps
even
imitate
it
seeley
also
wrote
with
sly
humor
your
boy
etching
is
capital
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
processes
this
remarkable
artist
employs
richard
frequently
expressed
his
intention
of
being
a
painter
but
his
father
though
much
pleased
to
notice
in
the
boy
a
real
tendency
towards
art
did
not
at
all
feel
certain
that
there
were
in
him
the
gifts
indispensable
to
the
making
of
an
artist
i
was
often
told
that
despite
the
cleverness
of
his
copies
and
even
of
his
caricatures
he
seemed
to
lack
invention
and
originality
however
it
was
understood
that
he
would
be
allowed
a
fair
trial
but
only
after
taking
his
degree
of
bachelier
for
his
father
was
of
opinion
that
perhaps
more
for
artists
than
for
men
in
other
professions
a
liberal
education
was
necessary
to
the
development
of
the
finest
aptitudes
he
also
thought
that
the
boys
might
now
appreciate
english
poetry
and
selected
short
passages
from
the
best
poets
which
he
read
aloud
in
the
evenings
whilst
they
followed
with
books
in
their
hands
it
accustomed
them
to
the
rhythm
and
to
the
music
of
the
language
and
the
peculiar
qualities
of
each
piece
were
explained
to
them
afterwards
little
mary
susan
also
received
encouragement
in
the
practice
of
her
music
for
i
see
this
entry
on
march
my
little
daughter
and
i
played
piano
and
violin
together
for
the
first
time
very
slowly
and
gradually
his
health
had
improved
and
he
was
in
almost
free
from
nervousness
but
he
had
not
yet
dared
to
attempt
railway
travelling
he
had
occasion
to
write
to
seymour
haden
and
here
is
part
of
the
reply
first
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
the
improvement
in
your
health
maintains
itself
next
that
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
do
you
a
plate
for
the
i
was
with
macmillan
the
other
day
and
heard
from
him
that
you
were
at
work
upon
a
new
edition
of
and
etchers
he
spoke
so
well
of
you
and
of
your
work
that
i
am
to
report
him
to
you
in
this
it
must
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
you
after
the
extraordinary
life
you
have
led
to
find
that
it
is
producing
such
satisfactory
results
may
it
and
the
good
effect
which
attends
it
continue
and
this
brings
me
to
speak
of
your
railway
malady
it
does
not
differ
from
other
cases
of
the
kind
in
any
one
particular
it
is
an
idiosyncracy
it
is
not
to
be
got
over
by
medicine
certainly
not
by
chloral
but
by
time
or
rather
by
the
difference
induced
in
the
constitution
by
age
a
man
may
be
subject
to
all
you
describe
at
forty
and
actually
free
from
such
symptoms
at
fifty
and
i
should
advise
you
to
yourself
after
so
long
an
abstinence
from
this
mode
of
travel
by
a
short
journey
now
and
then
no
accumulative
mischief
could
arrive
and
you
find
to
your
great
satisfaction
that
you
have
entirely
lost
your
enemy
if
you
do
by
all
means
come
pay
us
a
visit
and
see
what
we
are
doing
in
england
i
have
done
an
etching
of
pier
which
is
by
many
degrees
the
finest
thing
if
i
may
be
permitted
so
superlative
an
expression
i
have
done
or
ever
shall
do
i
mean
to
publish
it
about
the
close
of
the
year
i
have
a
press
for
printing
it
and
am
having
paper
expressly
and
real
sepia
which
is
magnificent
both
in
color
and
price
got
from
the
adriatic
for
the
ink
so
that
great
things
ought
to
and
the
result
was
certainly
by
far
the
finest
of
modern
etchings
according
to
hamerton
opinion
in
some
particulars
he
preferred
the
agamemnon
but
the
size
of
calais
pier
as
an
increase
of
difficulty
was
to
be
considered
and
if
the
agamemnon
was
an
original
conception
it
can
not
be
said
that
calais
pier
was
a
copy
so
much
being
due
to
interpretation
later
on
when
my
husband
was
in
possession
of
this
it
always
occupied
the
place
of
honor
in
the
house
following
haden
advice
he
now
tried
short
railway
journeys
at
intervals
by
slow
trains
so
that
he
could
get
out
frequently
at
the
numerous
stations
not
to
allow
the
accumulating
effect
of
the
vibration
and
generally
in
the
night
there
are
some
short
entries
about
it
in
the
diary
october
went
to
laisy
in
boat
with
de
fontenay
the
day
was
most
lovely
came
back
in
the
train
without
feeling
any
inconvenience
october
went
from
laisy
to
etang
by
the
river
dined
there
returned
by
train
in
the
evening
all
right
we
had
no
accidents
except
on
a
little
sunken
rock
after
chaseux
when
de
fontenay
boat
was
upset
in
this
manner
he
used
to
go
to
chalon
there
was
rather
a
long
stoppage
at
chagny
for
change
of
train
to
stay
two
or
three
days
with
my
mother
and
brother
who
lived
there
he
was
still
anxious
and
uneasy
but
he
nerved
himself
to
bear
the
discomfort
in
the
hope
that
he
would
get
inured
to
it
in
time
and
he
used
to
close
his
eyes
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
carriage
and
to
draw
the
curtains
to
avoid
seeing
the
objects
that
we
passed
on
the
line
in
the
summer
of
he
received
from
the
new
owner
of
innistrynich
an
invitation
to
revisit
the
dear
island
nothing
could
have
given
him
more
pleasure
muir
gave
him
all
the
details
of
the
improvements
he
had
effected
but
said
i
retained
the
old
cottage
with
its
twelve
small
apartments
and
added
a
new
front
containing
five
rooms
i
saw
donald
macorquodale
whom
my
husband
often
had
in
the
boat
with
him
he
was
much
pleased
to
hear
that
you
had
been
inquiring
about
him
he
is
now
getting
frail
and
not
very
able
to
work
he
requested
me
to
say
that
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
of
you
and
would
be
delighted
to
see
you
at
loch
awe
he
sold
the
boats
you
were
so
kind
as
to
give
him
but
he
only
received
a
small
sum
for
them
having
kept
them
too
long
my
husband
never
forgot
his
old
servants
and
showed
his
interest
in
them
whenever
he
could
they
had
great
affection
and
respect
for
him
mingled
with
awe
well
knowing
that
although
he
gave
his
orders
kindly
he
meant
to
be
obeyed
there
was
a
very
trusty
widow
who
came
to
our
house
twice
a
week
and
i
remember
finding
her
in
tears
and
asking
what
was
the
matter
ah
monsieur
qui
grond√©e
she
sobbed
desperately
but
what
has
he
said
to
put
you
in
such
a
state
oh
he
did
not
say
much
only
why
will
you
scratch
off
the
paint
with
the
matches
quand
monsieur
gronde
and
there
was
a
fresh
explosion
it
was
well
that
my
husband
health
was
better
for
it
enabled
him
to
bear
the
saddening
news
of
his
uncle
thomas
approaching
end
he
had
for
the
last
few
months
grown
weaker
and
weaker
till
his
sister
wrote
west
lodge
the
loss
of
my
dear
worthy
brother
is
indeed
a
sad
blow
to
me
and
i
was
not
able
to
attend
the
funeral
i
am
better
now
though
the
doctor
is
still
in
attendance
upon
me
i
should
indeed
have
liked
you
both
to
have
been
here
but
i
could
not
press
you
or
even
expect
you
to
run
such
a
risk
still
i
look
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
all
at
west
lodge
before
the
winter
sets
in
it
may
be
here
briefly
explained
that
miss
susan
hamerton
greatly
needed
her
nephew
advice
about
money
matters
they
had
been
hitherto
managed
by
her
brother
and
she
had
had
no
care
about
it
but
now
after
entrusting
what
she
possessed
to
a
person
recommended
by
hamerton
she
had
become
aware
that
it
was
not
safe
and
was
afraid
of
losing
the
savings
she
had
been
able
to
make
for
she
had
no
control
over
the
capital
it
was
difficult
to
explain
all
this
by
letters
and
she
was
anxious
to
give
all
the
details
by
word
of
mouth
consequently
she
grew
more
and
more
pressing
in
the
expression
of
the
desire
that
her
nephew
should
attempt
the
journey
he
was
not
to
be
detained
by
the
consideration
of
expense
for
she
intended
to
make
him
a
present
of
some
which
she
no
longer
wanted
since
her
brother
had
left
her
an
increase
of
income
for
her
life
my
husband
resolved
to
undertake
the
long
journey
in
the
course
of
and
to
arrange
his
work
in
view
of
it
besides
his
contributions
to
different
periodicals
he
had
in
the
year
entirely
written
round
my
house
prepared
the
new
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
got
the
notes
necessary
for
the
life
of
turner
and
given
much
consideration
to

in

the

rules
written
by
my

for
his
own
guidance
rise
at
six
in
winter
and
five
in

go
to
bed
at
eleven
in

and
ten
in

there
must
be
two
literary
sittings
every

first
to
be
over
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
leave
me
free

practical

work
the
second
to
begin
at
five
and
end
at
seven
really
worth
reading
must
be
read
every

the
quantity
not

i
must
go
out
every
day
whatever
the
weather
may
be
time
may
be
taken
no
matter
when
for
putting
things
in
order
the
best
way
is
to
do
it
every
morning
before
setting
to
work
it
is
better
to
try
to
keep
things
in
order
than
to
accumulate
disorder
keep
everything
in
readiness
for
immediate
work
in
literature
and
art
when
tired
rest
completely
but
never
dawdle
be
either
in
harness
or
out
of
harness
avowedly
special
importance
is
to
be
given
to
painting
this
year
pictures
are
to
be
first
painted

monochrome
in
raw
umber
and

at

year
roberts
brothers
had
asked
for
a
photograph
of
the
now
popular
author
of
the
intellectual
life
in
april
they
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
two
and
were
sending
some
copies
of
the
engraving
from
them
they
also
said
suppose
we
should
wish
to
bring
out
an
edition
of
this
autumn
would
you
abridge
and
rewrite
it
condensation
would
be
likely
to
make
it
more
powerful
and
more
interesting
or
perhaps
you
would
rather
write
an
entirely
new
novel
we
think
such
a
novel
as
you
could
write
would
have
a
large
sale
the
accompanying
letters
will
interest
you
as
proofs
of
your
growing
popularity
we
mail
you
by
request
of
miss
may
alcott
a
copy
of
her
father
clever
little
volume
days
a
fine
old
gentleman
he
is
the
worthy
father
of
the
most
popular
of
american
authoresses
here
is
miss
may
alcott
letter
my
dear
hamerton
i
am
pleased
and
proud
that
you
should
have
considered
my
letter
worthy
an
answer
and
i
am
still
more
gratified
to
be
allowed
the
satisfaction
of
selecting
the
best
pictures
of
great
man
for
you
emerson
has
been
for
more
than
thirty
years
the
most
intimate
friend
of
my
father
as
also
emerson
and
mother
the
daughters
and
myself
growing
up
together
and
as
father
is
thought
to
know
and
understand
the
poet
perhaps
better
than
any
other
contemporary
i
venture
sending
by
post
one
of
his
books
which
contains
an
essay
on
emerson
which
may
interest
you
it
was
thought
so
fine
and
true
on
its
first
appearance
that
it
was
published
in
illuminated
form
for
private
circulation
only
but
as
there
is
not
a
copy
of
the
small
edition
to
be
obtained
i
send
days
instead
this
morning
on
receipt
of
your
very
kind
reply
to
my
letter
i
went
to
study
and
read
him
the
paragraph
relating
to
himself
which
pleased
him
exceedingly
and
while
his
daughter
ellen
stood
smilingly
beside
him
he
said
i
know
hamerton
better
than
he
thinks
for
as
i
have
read
his
earlier
works
and
though
i
did
not
meet
him
while
in
england
i
value
all
he
writes
then
i
showed
him
the
two
pictures
which
father
and
i
thought
the
preferable
likenesses
which
i
enclose
by
mail
to
you
though
he
produced
a
collection
taken
at
elliot
and
fry
baker
street
london
from
which
we
find
none
better
on
the
whole
than
this
head
which
gives
his
exact
expression
and
the
little
one
giving
the
of
the
man
we
admire
so
much
few
things
could
have
given
greater
pleasure
to
hamerton
than
to
learn
that
his
works
were
appreciated
by
such
a
writer
and
thinker
as
emerson
whose
books
he
studied
and
enjoyed
and
quoted
very
frequently
but
he
was
quite
put
out
by
the
engraving
of
his
portrait
which
indeed
could
not
be
called
a
likeness
he
wrote
as
much
to
roberts
brothers
who
replied
we
are
not
a
bit
disappointed
to
hear
that
you
do
like
the
head
for
we
have
come
to
consider
the
dislike
of
all
authors
to
similar
things
as
chronic
they
offered
however
to
have
the
plate
corrected
according
to
the
victim
directions
and
added
but
take
heart
upon
the
fact
that
nine
hundred
and
out
of
a
thousand
who
look
upon
it
believe
it
to
be
a
facsimile
of
yourself
and
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
in
another
letter
they
say
again
the
head
which
to
you
is
an
insurmountable
defect
is
favorably
looked
upon
by
everybody
if
hamerton
should
hear
the
praise
from
fair
lips
she
would
certainly
be
jealous
however
the
engraver
will
see
how
nearly
he
can
conform
to
your
wishes
and
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
please
you
yet
no
praises
from
lips
however
fair
would
have
induced
me
to
put
up
with
the
portrait
and
i
said
so
frankly
without
being
at
all
influenced
by
jealousy
for
in
my
opinion
the
original
was
far
handsomer
in
expression
and
bearing
than
the
likeness
but
roberts
brothers
who
had
never
seen
the
original
still
clung
to
the
obnoxious
engraving
and
wrote
again
if
are
deluded
and
happy
in
that
delusion
why
should
care
hamerton
she
must
confess
it
is
jealous
of
our
fair
countrywomen
nevertheless
it
was
withdrawn
in
deference
to
our
wishes
mr
powers
was
now
and
then
discreetly
reminding
hamerton
of
his
promised
pictures
and
after
hearing
from
the
painter
that
they
were
whatever
that
may
have
brought
to
his
mind
sent
these
verses
my
pictures
a
famous
artist
over
the
sea
promised
to
paint
two
pictures
for
me
he
wrought
but
his
colors
would
not
show
his
pure
ideal
and
heart
warm
glow
and
so
the
paintings
are
still
unsent
though
years
ago
their
spirit
went
two
pictures
hang
in
my
treasured
thought
my
dream
of
those
the
artist
wrought
they
are
sweet
and
fadeless
and
soothe
my
sight
when
weary
and
sad
with
a
strange
delight
but
the
light
which
shows
their
marvellous
art
is
the
generous
glow
of
the
painter
heart
this
is
the
way
that
there
came
to
me
the
gift
of
pictures
from
over
the
sea
answer
there
a
parson
out
west
in
chicago
to
whom
i
did
promise
long
ago
a
couple
of
pictures
not
fearing
strictures
of
the
critical
folk
of
chicago
time
passed
and
the
works
were
not
finished
time
passed
yet
with
hope
undiminished
that
parson
he
wrote
and
my
conscience
he
smote
and
so
was
i
greatly
punished
for
a
promise
is
not
a
and
will
is
changed
to
when
you
say
to
a
friend
pictures
i
send
and
he
orders
the
in
trust
then
the
parson
he
sighed
in
despair
are
my
two
pictures
o
where
in
regions
ideal
far
far
from
the
real
like
cloudscapes
that
melt
into
air
and
then
i
thought
it
grows
serious
for
deferred
hope
is
most
deleterious
yet
how
can
i
toil
in
color
and
oil
in
a
world
where
the
publishers
weary
us
ah
me
for
a
month
with
the
flowers
and
the
sweet
april
sunshine
and
showers
to
paint
with
delight
from
morning
till
night
for
my
dear
friend
horatio
n
powers
it
may
be
said
here
that
the
pictures
were
completed
and
packed
off
in
the
beginning
of
october
in
view
of
a
series
of
large
etchings
hamerton
went
to
decize
on
the
loire
where
he
hoped
to
find
material
for
several
subjects
he
made
twenty
sketches
of
the
town
river
boats
and
then
called
upon
hanoteau
the
painter
who
had
expressed
a
desire
for
his
acquaintance
there
is
a
short
note
relating
the
visit
april
arrived
at
ten
and
had
a
pleasant
day
watching
him
paint
i
also
saw
the
interior
of
his
atelier
and
the
things
in
progress
he
only
paints
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
always
from
nature
when
we
had
finished
we
went
together
to
a
little
in
the
wood
near
to
which
were
some
old
cottages
he
painted
that
bit
on
a
small
panel
after
completing
his
sitting
he
showed
me
part
of
the
road
to
and
a
gentleman
with
him
showed
me
the
rest
had
a
deal
of
art
talk
with
hanoteau
also
with
a
young
sculptor
called
gautherin
this
young
sculptor
was
poor
but
energetic
and
courageous
he
rapidly
made
his
way
to
fame
but
unfortunately
died
too
soon
to
reap
the
benefit
of
his
remarkable
talent
the
idea
of
an
abridged
wenderholme
had
been
accepted
by
the
author
who
had
written
to
blackwood
about
it
and
who
received
the
satisfactory
answer
that
though
they
had
sustained
a
loss
with
the
first
publication
they
thought
that
the
reputation
and
popularity
of
the
writer
having
considerably
increased
would
sell
well
in
their
series
of
novels
in
consequence
the
revision
was
begun
at
once
for
roberts
brothers
had
also
written
whenever
you
feel
inclined
to
take
up
we
shall
be
glad
to
comply
with
your
demand
and
there
followed
a
new
proposition
in
the
same
letter
since
writing
you
about
a
new
novel
we
have
had
an
inspiration
and
have
already
acted
upon
it
a
series
of
novelettes
to
be
published
anonymously
the
secret
of
authorship
for
a
period
to
rest
entirely
with
the
author
and
publisher
we
shall
call
it
the
name
series
and
issue
it
in
neat
square
volumes
of
about
pages
to
sell
for
one
dollar
those
to
whom
we
have
suggested
the
idea
are
mightily
pleased
and
we
are
even
tickled
with
the
great
fun
we
expect
to
have
something
like
a
new
experience
of
the
unknown
days
of
sir
walter
scott
we
have
several
promises
from
authors
and
we
all
agree
that
you
must
write
one
of
them
take
your
own
time
to
do
so
and
when
you
send
us
the
we
will
advance
towards
the
copyright
people
say
it
will
be
impossible
to
keep
the
secret
for
an
author
style
can
not
be
hidden
but
though
it
may
be
easy
enough
to
say
this
is
hamerton
anybody
can
tell
his
style
it
is
not
there
will
be
uncertainty
enough
to
make
it
exciting
and
create
a
demand
we
hope
a
large
one
although
my
husband
had
not
been
so
well
in
the
spring
it
was
the
worst
time
of
the
year
for
him
he
decided
to
start
for
england
early
in
june
to
see
the
paris
salon
and
the
english
academy
he
did
not
ask
me
to
go
with
him
for
our
daughter
had
had
quite
recently
a
bad
attack
of
bronchitis
at
one
time
we
had
even
feared
inflammation
of
the
lungs
and
the
greatest
care
against
the
possibility
of
colds
had
been
recommended
however
he
thought
he
would
be
equal
to
the
journey
and
gave
me
a
promise
to
stop
whenever
he
felt
unwell
he
reached
paris
all
right
did
his
work
there
and
had
a
kind
letter
from
seeley
who
said
i
was
greatly
pleased
to
receive
your
card
this
morning
and
learn
that
you
had
had
a
successful
journey
now
you
will
certainly
come
and
see
me
wo
you
is
here
and
will
remain
till
the
end
of
next
week
if
you
are
with
us
then
we
will
get
him
to
kingston
and
have
a
day
on
the
thames
together
and
all
of
us
shall
make
sketches
it
was
very
tempting
but
the
next
news
was
not
so
good
and
seeley
wrote
again
if
you
have
lost
your
appetite
in
a
big
town
the
remedy
is
plain
come
to
kingston
at
once
you
will
not
be
much
troubled
with
noise
there
and
you
can
paddle
about
on
the
river
and
get
hungry
or
go
flying
madly
about
on
a
bicycle
if
you
have
kept
up
the
practice
there
is
a
big
bedroom
empty
and
waiting
for
you
the
journey
was
resumed
as
far
as
amiens
but
the
enemy
proved
too
strong
to
be
overcome
by
courage
and
resolution
and
after
resting
two
days
my
husband
came
back
home
by
easy
stages
having
only
told
me
the
truth
after
leaving
amiens
to
prevent
my
going
to
him
at
any
cost
he
reached
la
tuilerie
on
the
first
of
july
and
i
see
in
the
diary
rested
at
home
very
glad
to
be
there
the
attempt
was
not
attended
by
any
lasting
bad
effects
he
immediately
regained
his
appetite
and
usual
health
but
his
aunt
susan
was
sorely
disappointed
he
tried
to
soothe
her
by
explaining
what
he
believed
to
be
the
combined
causes
of
his
breakdown
first
the
intense
heat
which
had
made
his
stay
in
paris
very
trying
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
there
and
lastly
the
weakness
supervening
after
the
loss
of
appetite
also
due
to
the
abnormal
heat
which
was
causing
several
sunstrokes
every
day
even
in
england
he
announced
his
intention
of
making
another
attempt
with
me
in
the
autumn
when
the
chances
would
be
more
in
his
favor
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
study
of
painting
had
become
predominant
and
had
necessitated
rather
a
heavy
outlay
because
gilbert
schemes
were
always
so
elaborate
and
complex
of
different
sizes
every
one
of
them
with
a
tin
cover
painted
and
varnished
some
for
others
for
charcoals
canvases
for
oils
and
monochromes
wooden
and
porcelain
palettes
pastilles
tubes
portable
easels
sunshades
knapsacks
stools
brushes
papers
for
and
chalk
studies
tinted
and
white
numberless
portfolios
to
class
the
studies
and
a
gig
to
carry
the
paraphernalia
to
greater
distances
and
in
less
time
than
the
carriage
required
i
was
against
the
gig
but
the
boys
were
of
course
delighted
and
declared
with
their
father
that
it
had
become
absolutely
necessary
i
see
in
the
diary
july
in
the
evening
went
to
autun
on
cocote
enjoyed
the
ride
considerably
brought
back
the
gig
wife
sulky
the
expenses
of
the
year
had
been
very
heavy
owing
to
several
causes
first
some
house
repairs
had
become
inevitable
and
the
landlord
offering
us
only
the
option
of
doing
them
at
our
own
cost
or
leaving
the
house
we
had
to
order
them
the
roofs
were
in
such
a
state
that
in
stormy
weather
we
had
our
ceilings
and
drenched
with
and
indeed
it
had
even
begun
to
make
its
way
the
ceilings
into
the
inhabited
rooms
the
diary
for
march
says
a
very
stormy
day
the
wildest
of
the
whole
year
we
arranged
the
tents
stephen
and
i
in
the
attic
to
prevent
the
rain
from
coming
into
our
bedroom
then
there
had
been
boats
made
for
the
boys
cheap
boats
it
is
true
made
by
common
joiners
they
were
well
deserved
i
acknowledge
the
boys
had
had
each
an
accessit
at
the
concours
acad√©mique
and
both
were
mentioned
with
praise
by
the
at
the
public
distribution
of
prizes
besides
what
was
still
more
important
stephen
had
successfully
passed
his
examination
for
the
baccalaur√©at
lastly
there
had
been
an
expensive
and
unproductive
journey
and
there
was
the
prospect
of
another
all
this
in
the
same
year
somewhat
alarmed
me
the
gig
was
not
an
important
concern
being
made
like
the
carriage
from
designs
of
my
husband
by
ordinary
wheelwrights
and
blacksmiths
but
though
admitting
its
usefulness
and
even
desirableness
i
thought
we
might
have
done
without
it
in
the
beginning
of
august
my
husband
told
me
the
plan
of
marmorne
for
the
no
name
series
and
i
had
been
afraid
that
it
would
be
too
melodramatic
however
i
was
charmed
when
he
read
me
the
beginning
and
my
fears
were
soon
dispelled
by
the
strength
and
simplicity
of
the
narrative
on
october
we
started
for
england
leaving
my
mother
in
charge
of
the
house
and
children
we
stopped
at
fontainebleau
in
the
morning
and
after
visited
the
forest
pretty
thoroughly
in
a
carriage
after
dinner
we
went
on
to
paris
where
we
stayed
only
four
days
for
fear
of
its
effects
and
proceeded
to
calais
by
a
luckily
for
gilbert
he
could
sleep
very
well
in
a
railway
carriage
and
was
unknown
to
him
we
crossed
in
the
castalia
in
very
rough
weather
indeed
the
waves
jumping
over
the
deck
and
covering
everything
there
with
foam
at
one
time
there
came
a
huge
one
dashing
just
against
my
husband
block
as
he
was
sketching
and
drenched
him
from
head
to
foot
however
he
took
a
warm
bath
at
dover
changed
his
clothes
and
felt
only
the
better
for
the
passage
seeley
house
was
reached
at
midnight
and
very
happy
was
hamerton
to
meet
his
friend
again
and
to
be
once
more
in
england
after
an
enforced
absence
of
seven
years
on
the
morrow
our
kind
host
and
hostess
took
us
to
hampton
court
palace
thence
to
richmond
park
by
twickenham
and
altogether
made
us
pass
a
most
pleasant
day
the
following
day
was
reserved
for
the
national
gallery
and
i
find
this
note
in
the
diary
i
was
delighted
to
see
the
turner
collection
again
and
greatly
struck
by
the
luminous
quality
of
the
late
works
this
could
not
possibly
have
been
got
without
the
white
grounds
on
the
sunday
we
went
to
balham
to
dine
early
with
and
macmillan
and
met
ralston
and
green
the
historian
it
was
noted
as
a
very
interesting
day
by
my
husband
on
the
sixth
day
we
took
leave
of
and
seeley
and
took
a
for
peterborough
where
we
visited
the
cathedral
and
town
to
await
the
dusk
then
on
to
doncaster
and
knottingly
from
knottingly
we
did
not
see
clearly
how
to
reach
featherstone
and
were
greatly
embarrassed
when
a
coachman
who
had
just
driven
his
master
to
the
station
foresaw
the
possibility
of
a
handsome
tip
and
offered
to
take
us
without
luggage
in
his
trap
it
was
pitch
dark
he
had
no
lamps
the
road
was
all
ruts
and
the
horse
flew
along
like
mad
we
only
held
to
our
seats
or
rather
kept
resuming
them
in
a
succession
of
bumps
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
and
up
in
the
air
by
grasping
the
sides
of
the
trap
with
all
our
might
till
a
sudden
stop
nearly
threw
us
all
out
at
any
rate
it
did
throw
us
in
a
heap
over
each
other
at
the
bottom
of
the
trap
unhurt
it
was
with
a
sense
of
immense
relief
that
we
plodded
the
rest
of
our
way
to
the
vicarage
where
we
arrived
at
eleven
the
diary
says
october
saw
my
aunt
susan
again
for
the
first
time
since
at
which
time
i
hardly
hoped
ever
to
see
her
again
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
gilbert
to
witness
the
affectionate
care
taken
of
his
aunt
by
her
niece
annie
hinde
and
her
brother
ben
with
whom
she
lived
he
had
always
entertained
a
great
liking
for
these
cousins
but
it
was
increased
during
his
stay
at
the
vicarage
by
their
hospitable
and
friendly
ways
and
by
his
gratitude
for
their
having
given
to
his
dear
relative
as
much
of
peaceful
satisfaction
as
it
was
in
their
power
to
do
miss
susan
hamerton
was
aged
no
doubt
but
she
was
still
able
to
do
everything
for
herself
and
to
occupy
her
time
usefully
in
housekeeping
sewing
reading
writing
and
going
out
she
still
retained
her
strong
will
and
manifested
it
in
a
way
which
nearly
destroyed
all
the
pleasure
of
the
meeting
with
her
nephew
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
yielded
to
it
by
consenting
to
a
transfer
of
in
his
favor
which
involved
great
liabilities
she
would
not
listen
to
an
explanation
of
the
risk
and
considered
it
ungracious
to
look
the
in
the
mouth
it
had
been
a
capital
investment
she
said
and
she
remained
absolutely
opposed
to
the
sale
of
the
shares
her
nephew
had
to
accept
the
gift
as
it
was
so
that
instead
of
relieving
anxiety
it
created
a
new
one
however
having
come
to
give
her
a
little
of
the
sunshine
of
happiness
he
decided
not
to
let
it
be
clouded
over
we
stayed
a
month
in
happy
and
cordial
intercourse
my
husband
spending
the
intervals
of
work
in
long
talks
and
walks
with
his
aunt
and
when
the
time
for
our
departure
arrived
the
sadness
of
parting
was
soothed
by
the
hope
of
meeting
again
now
that
gilbert
seemed
to
have
recovered
the
power
of
travelling
on
our
return
to
london
we
lunched
with
seymour
haden
who
took
my
husband
to
the
room
in
which
he
kept
his
collections
where
they
had
a
long
talk
on
art
matters
and
where
he
gave
him
a
proof
of
the
agamemnon
whilst
i
was
having
a
chat
over
family
interests
children
and
music
with
haden
in
the
afternoon
we
called
upon
george
eliot
and
lewes
who
were
very
friendly
indeed
i
was
greatly
struck
by
george
eliot
memory
for
she
remembered
everything
i
had
told
her
seven
years
ago
about
our
rustic
life
and
her
first
question
was
are
your
children
well
and
do
you
still
drive
them
to
college
in
a
she
was
gravely
sympathetic
in
alluding
to
the
cause
of
our
long
absence
from
london
and
when
i
said
how
great
was
my
husband
satisfaction
in
being
there
again
she
seized
both
of
my
hands
softly
in
hers
and
asked
in
the
low
modulations
of
her
rich
voice
is
there
no
gap
thank
god
i
answered
there
is
none
then
she
let
go
my
hands
and
smiling
as
if
relieved
she
said
let
us
talk
over
the
past
years
since
you
came
and
then
she
told
me
of
the
growing
interest
manifested
by
the
thinking
world
in
the
works
of
my
husband
we
are
all
marvelling
at
the
of
talent
in
one
so
young
still
and
look
forward
hopefully
for
what
he
may
achieve
the
day
after
we
saw
calderon
in
his
studio
painting
two
beautiful
decorative
pictures
there
was
a
garland
of
flowers
in
one
of
them
the
freshness
of
their
coloring
was
admirable
we
missed
woolner
who
was
out
and
thence
went
to
macmillan
place
of
business
and
with
him
to
knapdale
where
we
dined
and
stayed
all
night
as
soon
as
dessert
had
been
put
on
the
table
macmillan
begged
to
be
excused
for
a
short
time
as
she
wished
to
see
that
freeman
who
was
on
a
visit
but
not
well
enough
to
come
down
had
been
made
comfortable
on
hearing
of
freeman
presence
at
knapdale
my
husband
expressed
his
regrets
at
not
being
able
to
see
him
and
these
regrets
were
kindly
conveyed
to
the
invalid
by
macmillan
who
brought
back
his
request
to
hamerton
for
a
visit
in
his
bedroom
i
heard
with
satisfaction
that
freeman
had
been
very
cordial
and
had
shown
no
trace
of
resentment
at
what
had
passed
at
a
former
meeting
at
macmillan
house
the
conversation
had
then
turned
on
ireland
and
macmillan
was
like
my
husband
for
granting
autonomy
this
set
freeman
growling
at
the
use
of
a
greek
word
and
he
exclaimed
why
ca
you
speak
english
and
say
home
rule
instead
of
using
greek
which
you
do
know
my
husband
flushed
with
anger
and
recalled
the
irritable
historian
not
without
severity
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
respect
due
to
their
host
at
the
same
time
paying
a
tribute
to
macmillan
remarkable
abilities
later
in
the
evening
the
word
gout
was
mentioned
there
again
freeman
exclaimed
why
ca
we
call
it
but
this
was
said
in
a
joke
and
accompanied
with
a
laugh
wherever
we
went
we
heard
praises
of
the
portfolio
throughout
his
life
hamerton
remained
not
only
on
good
terms
but
on
friendly
terms
with
every
one
of
his
publishers
and
whenever
he
went
to
london
he
looked
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
meeting
them
in
succession
there
were
of
course
different
degrees
of
intimacy
but
the
intercourse
was
never
other
than
agreeable
for
many
years
he
had
wished
to
know
samuel
palmer
personally
and
the
wish
was
reciprocated
now
an
opportunity
presented
itself
and
one
afternoon
saw
us
climbing
redhill
in
pleasant
anticipation
but
when
after
admiring
the
view
we
rang
the
bell
of
the
artist
secluded
abode
we
were
told
that
palmer
had
been
very
ill
lately
was
still
keeping
his
bed
and
could
see
no
one
it
was
a
great
disappointment
and
some
words
to
this
effect
were
written
on
a
card
and
sent
up
to
the
invalid
soon
after
palmer
came
down
and
feelingly
expressed
her
sincere
regrets
she
told
us
of
his
illness
which
had
left
him
very
weak
and
liable
to
relapses
and
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
derived
from
a
long
talk
with
hamerton
on
artistic
topics
we
had
been
shown
into
the
which
evidently
for
the
present
was
not
used
though
it
was
warmed
by
a
good
fire
but
darkened
by
the
blinds
being
down
and
the
curtains
drawn
the
rays
of
a
golden
sunset
diffused
through
the
apertures
a
strange
and
mysterious
glow
which
suddenly
seemed
to
surround
and
envelope
an
apparition
standing
half
visible
on
the
threshold
of
the
noiselessly
opened
door
a
remarkably
expressive
head
emerged
from
a
bundle
of
shawls
which
moved
forward
with
feeble
and
tottering
steps
it
was
palmer
his
wife
could
not
trust
her
eyes
but
as
soon
as
she
became
convinced
of
the
reality
of
his
presence
she
hastened
to
make
him
comfortable
in
an
by
the
fire
and
to
arrange
the
shawls
over
his
head
and
knees
with
the
most
touching
solicitude
i
could
not
resist
it
he
pleaded
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
meeting
with
so
much
longing
his
eyes
sparkled
his
countenance
became
animated
and
regardless
of
his
wraps
he
accompanied
his
fluent
talk
with
eloquent
gestures
to
the
despair
of
his
wife
who
had
enough
to
do
in
replacing
cap
and
rugs
he
put
all
his
soul
and
energy
and
now
there
was
no
lack
of
it
into
his
speech
the
kindled
all
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
within
him
and
he
told
us
anecdotes
of
turner
and
blake
and
held
us
for
a
long
time
fascinated
with
the
charm
of
his
conversation
he
could
listen
too
and
with
so
vivid
an
interest
and
sympathy
that
his
mere
looks
were
an
encouragement
my
husband
was
afraid
of
detaining
him
but
he
declared
he
felt
quite
well
and
strong
the
visiting
angels
had
put
to
flight
the
lurking
enemy
he
had
even
an
appetite
which
he
would
satisfy
in
our
company
nothing
loath
we
sat
down
to
an
excellent
tea
with
delicious
butter
and
eggs
with
the
impression
of
sharing
the
life
of
elves
and
of
being
entertained
by
a
genie
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
served
by
a
kind
fairy
this
feeling
originated
no
doubt
in
the
small
stature
of
and
palmer
in
the
strange
effect
of
light
under
which
our
host
first
appeared
to
us
and
lastly
in
the
noiseless
promptitude
with
which
the
repast
was
spread
on
the
table
whilst
the
darkness
of
the
room
gave
way
to
brightness
just
as
happens
in
fairytales
it
is
curious
that
my
husband
and
myself
should
have
received
exactly
the
same
impression
and
a
lasting
one
the
journey
to
paris
was
resumed
by
slow
without
disturbance
to
his
health
and
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
had
a
long
talk
about
etching
with
leopold
flameng
who
encouraged
my
attempts
and
even
offered
to
correct
his
defective
plates
rather
than
see
them
destroyed
but
this
was
declined
though
the
valuable
advice
was
gratefully
accepted
flameng
looked
very
happy
he
was
in
full
success
very
industrious
and
fond
of
his
art
married
to
a
devoted
wife
of
simple
tastes
and
already
able
to
discern
and
foster
in
his
son
the
artistic
tendencies
which
have
made
him
celebrated
since
they
were
a
very
cheerful
and
united
family
two
days
after
we
had
with
rajon
of
all
the
french
etchers
who
from
time
to
time
went
to
london
for
the
portfolio
i
believe
rajon
was
the
one
best
known
in
english
society
where
his
liveliness
and
amiability
as
well
as
his
great
talent
found
appreciators
like
almost
every
other
artist
he
did
not
attach
so
much
importance
to
what
he
could
do
well
as
to
what
he
could
never
master
his
ambition
was
to
become
a
celebrated
painter
but
his
pictures
gave
little
hope
of
it
they
were
heavy
and
dull
in
color
and
entirely
devoid
of
the
charm
he
lent
to
his
etchings
he
showed
himself
very
grateful
for
what
hamerton
had
done
for
his
reputation
accidentally
as
he
was
admiring
the
design
of
some
very
simple
earrings
i
wore
i
said
that
i
did
not
care
so
much
for
jewels
as
for
lace
on
which
he
answered
he
was
extremely
fond
of
both
on
women
and
invited
me
to
go
and
see
a
collection
of
old
laces
he
was
forming
i
was
obliged
to
decline
for
our
time
was
running
short
but
he
made
us
promise
to
pay
a
long
visit
to
his
studio
during
our
next
sojourn
in
paris
we
reached
home
safely
and
found
my
mother
and
the
children
all
well
there
had
been
a
great
step
made
in
the
possibility
of
travelling
this
year
though
it
had
been
attended
by
many
returns
of
anxiety
and
nervousness
still
it
was
a
not
inconsiderable
gain
to
know
that
in
case
a
journey
became
absolutely
necessary
it
might
be
achieved
and
our
stay
in
london
and
paris
had
been
of
importance
in
allowing
my
husband
to
study
seriously
in
the
public
galleries
mr
powers
had
been
delighted
to
receive
his
pictures
and
wrote
his
thanks
in
terms
of
enthusiasm
he
said
that
many
people
had
been
admiring
them
and
that
a
painter
had
exclaimed
now
i
swear
by
hamerton
about
the
growing
popularity
he
wrote
as
i
said
before
you
win
the
hearts
of
men
and
your
name
is
now
a
household
word
in
many
quarters
of
this
country
it
was
exactly
in
almost
identical
words
what
roberts
brothers
had
already
written
and
this
was
true
not
only
in
america
for
many
english
letters
echoed
it
round
my
house
was
very
well
received
there
was
an
important
and
favorable
review
in
the
times
and
one
in
the
d√©bats
by
taine
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
gilbert
had
undertaken
the
painting
and
decoration
of
the
staircase
and
lobby
which
occasioned
a
great
amount
of
labor
and
fatigue
and
interfered
with
his
other
work
he
gave
it
up
at
my
entreaty
and
only
directed
the
painter
being
thus
enabled
to
devote
more
time
to
the
articles
on
drawing
in
preparation
for
black
new
edition
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
which
were
finished
in
february
soon
after
he
told
me
of
a
plan
for
a
new
book
the
title
of
which
he
meant
to
be
human
intercourse
and
which
would
require
a
large
number
of
memoranda
we
all
liked
the
idea
in
the
family
circle
when
it
was
explained
and
he
began
immediately
to
gather
materials
at
the
same
time
he
continued
his
readings
for
the
biographies
of
remarkable
frenchmen
and
he
contemplated
the
task
with
deep
interest
and
earnestness
the
year
which
had
begun
so
auspiciously
had
in
store
for
my
husband
one
of
the
lasting
sorrows
of
his
life
on
the
morning
of
march
he
received
a
telegram
announcing
the
death
of
his
beloved
caroline
pelletier
who
had
died
at
algiers
of
meningitis
leaving
three
young
children
to
the
care
of
their
desolate
father
it
was
a
heavy
blow
an
irreparable
loss
she
had
been
like
both
a
daughter
and
sister
and
her
affection
had
always
been
very
sweet
to
him
the
shock
was
so
great
that
his
health
suffered
in
consequence
and
the
nervousness
reappeared
it
was
of
caroline
he
was
thinking
when
he
wrote
in
human
intercourse
this
passage
about
a
wife
relatives
they
may
even
in
course
of
time
win
such
a
place
in
one
affection
that
if
they
are
taken
away
by
death
they
will
leave
a
great
void
and
an
enduring
sorrow
i
write
these
lines
from
a
sweet
and
sad
experience
only
a
poet
can
write
of
these
sorrows
in
prose
one
can
not
sing
dirge
for
her
the
doubly
dead
in
that
she
died
so
young
pelletier
still
continued
with
his
children
to
spend
the
vacations
at
la
tuilerie
but
the
joy
fulness
of
these
holidays
was
now
replaced
by
sorrow
and
regrets
the
evenings
were
particularly
trying
for
of
late
years
they
had
been
very
merry
our
children
having
taken
a
great
fancy
to
acting
charades
we
all
took
part
in
them
by
turns
their
aunt
caroline
and
their
father
were
the
stars
of
the
company
and
to
this
day
they
recollect
her
irresistible
sprightliness
as
a
coquettish
french
attempting
the
conquest
of
their
father
in
the
character
of
the
typical
englishman
of
french
caricatures
she
smiled
curtsied
and
whirled
about
him
handling
her
brass
pans
so
daintily
tossing
them
so
dexterously
that
the
bewildered
and
dazzled
islander
could
not
resist
the
enchantress
and
joined
enthusiastically
in
the
chorus
of
the
song
she
had
improvised
la
femme
que
pr√©f√©re
toujours
la
cuisini√©re
while
she
played
the
accompaniment
with
a
wooden
spoon
upon
the
lids
of
the
pans
her
achieved
unqualified
success
in
the
part
of
the
englishman
he
had
kept
on
purpose
an
immense
hat
and
a
tartan
plaid
which
he
used
to
perfection
and
his
oh
and
ah
were
of
such
ludicrous
prolongation
and
his
gait
so
stiff
and
his
comical
blunders
delivered
with
so
much
of
haughty
assurance
that
he
brought
down
the
house
it
was
seldom
that
my
husband
consented
to
take
an
active
part
in
games
he
generally
preferred
being
a
spectator
but
whether
acting
or
listening
charades
were
one
of
the
few
pastimes
for
which
he
had
a
taste
it
seems
the
more
strange
since
he
did
not
care
for
the
theatre
though
he
liked
plays
to
be
read
to
him
i
suppose
that
the
feeling
of
being
penned
in
a
crowded
place
was
insupportable
to
him
after
the
death
of
my
sister
some
years
had
to
elapse
before
we
could
bear
to
see
charades
again
on
may
my
husband
had
the
pleasure
of
bringing
home
from
the
railway
station
appleton
editor
of
the
academy
for
whom
he
had
a
great
regard
his
notes
say
we
passed
a
very
pleasant
evening
and
did
not
go
to
bed
till
after
twelve
walked
with
appleton
to
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
took
him
to
autun
and
showed
him
the
roman
arches
the
gothic
walls
the
cathedral
the
chemin
des
tours
etc
a
very
pleasant
day
we
got
home
in
time
for
dinner
found
the
boys
at
home
and
talked
till
one
in
the
morning
took
appleton
to
the
railway
in
the
morning
with
regrets
and
a
certain
sadness
on
account
of
his
health
appleton
was
on
his
way
to
egypt
by
his
doctor
advice
he
was
singularly
amiable
and
sympathetic
he
thought
and
said
simply
that
very
likely
he
had
not
long
to
live
and
dared
not
marry
on
that
account
though
he
often
felt
solitary
he
suffered
from
asthma
and
could
only
sleep
with
the
windows
of
his
bedroom
wide
open
and
a
bright
wood
fire
burning
in
the
chimney
he
had
promised
to
pay
us
another
visit
if
he
were
spared
but
alas
we
never
saw
him
again
as
the
biographies
advanced
the
author
grew
uncertain
about
the
title
he
would
give
them
it
could
not
be
celebrated
frenchmen
because
some
of
them
would
not
exactly
answer
to
the
qualification
he
had
thought
of
earnest
frenchmen
but
seeley
objected
and
said
the
word
has
got
spoilt
it
was
used
over
and
over
again
till
it
got
to
sound
like
cant
and
then
people
began
to
laugh
at
it
how
would
frenchmen
do
it
was
deemed
a
perfectly
suitable
title
and
given
to
the
book
at
the
end
of
the
summer
seeley
and
his
wife
paid
us
a
flying
visit
on
their
way
back
from
switzerland
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
see
them
again
shortly
after
them
came
and
i
could
not
help
directing
my
husband
attention
to
the
simplicity
of
his
arrangements
for
working
from
nature
a
small
stool
upon
which
was
fixed
a
canvas
or
a
and
a
were
all
he
required
however
i
was
told
that
wants
varied
with
individuals
hitherto
hamerton
plan
about
painting
had
been
to
begin
several
pictures
at
once
to
allow
them
to
dry
but
now
he
was
sick
of
remaining
so
long
over
the
same
pieces
of
work
and
he
decided
to
paint
only
two
pictures
at
a
time
and
to
use
drying
materials
he
had
succeeded
in
mastering
the
technicality
of
charcoal
drawing
and
had
made
an
arrangement
with
the
autotype
company
for
the
reproduction
of
some
drawings

this
medium

the

of

who
kept
destroying

notwithstanding
his
serious
studies
and
experiments
in

he
succeeded

with

sent

palmer
wrote
about

if
i
had
twenty
years
before

should
like
to

recommendation
to
me
for
with
few
exceptions
i
have
found
small
books
and
small
pictures
the
most
beautiful
and
i
doubt
not
that
you
know
better
than
myself
how
much
almost
all
novels
including
scott
would
be
improved
works
of
by
condensation
into
one
both
yourself
and
hamerton
are
often
mentally
present
with
us
here
the
evening
of
our
first
and
alas
only
meeting
is
among
the
vivid
pleasures
of
memory
and
a
repetition
is
a
cherished
pleasure
of
i
will
only
add
that
i
fear
you
are
killing
yourself
with
overwork
and
that
you
should
put
yourself
under
a
repressive
domestic
police
some
time
before
my
husband
had
received
from
lewes
a
letter
with
this
address
adolphus
segrave
care
of
hamerton
autun
george
eliot
and
lewes
had
been
reading
marmorne
and
had
never
entertained
the
slightest
doubt
about
the
authorship
though
the
book
was
published
under
the
assumed
name
of
adolphus
segrave
the
story
had
been
greatly
appreciated
by
both
of
them
and
especially
the
style
in
which
it
was
told
such
high
praise
was
in
accordance
with
what
palmer
had
previously
said
to
seeley
namely
that
he
considered
hamerton
as
the
first
of
his
time
it
may
be
remembered
that
a
cousin
of
my
husband
milne
had
called
upon
us
at
innistrynich
and
had
since
bought
his
little
property
he
heard
of
our
last
visit
to
yorkshire
and
not
aware
of
his
relative
trouble
in
regard
to
railway
travelling
had
felt
hurt
at
his
apparent
neglect
luckily
my
husband
heard
of
it
through
his
aunt
susan
and
immediately
wrote
to
explain
matters
milne
who
had
known
all
about
the
pecuniary
situation
now
answered
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
very
pleasing
to
me
to
know
that
your
career
has
been
so
successful
as
to
enable
you
to
give
your
sons
an
education
to
fit
them
to
grapple
with
the
difficulties
people
have
to
meet
with
nowadays
to
make
them
comfortable
and
to
do
so
is
all
the
more
satisfactory
when
accomplished
by
their
own
exertions
my
mother
the
lady
who
served
as
model
and
suggestion
for
ogden
in
still
retains
unimpaired
all
her
faculties
and
looks
much
the
same
as
when
you
were
here
we
shall
celebrate
her
birthday
on
march
she
really
is
wonderful
and
a
marvel
to
every
one
and
particularly
so
to
her
doctor
who
on
no
occasion
has
ever
prevailed
on
her
to
take
one
drop
of
medicine
notwithstanding
he
persists
in
coming
to
see
her
twice
a
week
for
what
reasons
seems
quite
past
my
mother
comprehension
the
pecuniary
situation
had
certainly
improved
which
was
a
relief
to
my
husband
for
his
children
were
growing
up
and
losses
due
to
remunerative
work
and
had
to
be
gradually
made
good
there
seemed
to
be
a
fate
adverse
to
his
making
money
even
by
his
most
successful
works
here
is
marmorne
as
an
example
published
in
america
in
england
in
france
both
in
hachette
biblioth√®que
des
meilleurs
romans
√©trangers
and
as
a
feuilleton
in
the
temps
also
in
the
tauchnitz
collection
unanimously
well
received
by
the
press
said
to
be
roman
de
by
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
and
still
bringing
considerably
less
than
to
the
author
purse
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
publishers
also
roberts
brothers
wrote
of
we
have
only
sold
copies
there
ought
to
have
been
sold
and
blackwood
said
the
sales
have
been
rather
disappointing
to
us
after
the
attention
and
favorable
impression
the
work
attracted
we
had
looked
for
a
larger
and
more
remunerative
demand
the
character
of
the
scenery
in
the
autunois
pleased
hamerton
more
and
more
though
it
lacked
the
grandeur
of
real
mountains
he
was
particularly
sensitive
to
the
beauty
of
its
color
which
reminded
him
sometimes
of
the
scotch
highlands
and
was
said
to
be
very
like
that
of
the
roman
campagna
in
such
notes
as
the
following
are
frequent
in
his
diary
january
went
to
fontaine
la
m√®re
beautiful
drive
the
whole
way
was
delighted
with
the
quality
of
the
landscape
much
of
the
sylvan
scenery
reminded
me
of
ruysda√´l
took
five
sketches
throughout
this
year
my
husband
gave
a
great
deal
of
his
time
to
his
aunt
affairs
which
were
in
a
deplorable
state
owing
to
the
dishonesty
of
her
lawyers
accounts
for
several
years
past
had
to
be
gone
over
cleared
up
and
settled
and
at
so
great
a
distance
the
proceedings
involved
a
heavy
correspondence
however
the
help
given
was
efficacious
and
miss
hamerton
independence
was
secured
in
the
end
in
the
summer
gilbert
had
to
relinquish
the
that
he
enjoyed
so
much
in
the
two
preceding
years
he
had
remarked
that
he
was
often
unwell
and
agitated
after
a
swim
but
had
kept
hoping
that
the
effect
might
be
transitory
it
was
however
now
renewed
with
growing
intensity
every
time
he
took
a
cold
bath
so
that
with
much
regret
he
had
to
give
them
up
he
used
to
say
with
a
shade
of
melancholy
that
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
the
gradual
deprivation
of
all
the
little
pleasures
of
existence
even
of
the
most
innocent
ones
but
that
the
hardest
for
him
to
renounce
would
be
work
having
borne
the
journey
to
england
in
without
bad
results
to
his
health
he
now
decided
to
attempt
a
visit
to
the
paris
international
exhibition
he
was
very
anxious
to
ascertain
the
present
state
of
the
fine
arts
all
over
the
globe
and
if
possible
to
make
the
best
of
this
opportunity
on
the
day
appointed
for
starting
and
whilst
he
was
packing
up
stevenson
just
happened
to
call
without
previous
notice
what
a
bright
winning
youth
he
was
what
a
delightful
talker
there
was
positively
a
sort
of
radiance
about
him
as
if
emanating
from
his
genius
we
had
never
seen
him
before
we
only
knew
his
works
but
he
seemed
like
a
friend
immediately
listening
to
his
fluent
felicitous
talk
his
clear
and
energetic
elocution
his
original
ideas
and
veins
of
thought
was
a
rare
treat
and
his
keen
enjoyment
of
recovered
health
and
active
life
was
really
infectious
he
could
not
remain
seated
but
walked
and
smoked
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
he
remained
with
us
knowing
that
he
had
lately
been
dangerously
ill
i
ventured
to
express
my
fear
that
the
smoking
of
endless
cigarettes
might
prove
injurious
oh
i
do
know
he
said
and
yet
i
dare
say
it
is
but
you
see
hamerton
as
there
are
only
a
very
limited
number
of
things
enjoyable
to
an
individual
in
this
world
must
be
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
and
if
i
knew
that
smoking
would
kill
me
still
i
would
not
give
it
up
for
i
shall
surely
die
of
very
likely
not
so
pleasant
although
the
shutters
were
closed
in
all
the
rooms
that
were
not
to
be
used
in
our
absence
they
were
opened
again
to
let
him
see
the
etchings
on
the
walls
for
he
had
a
fine
taste
not
only
for
the
beauties
of
nature
but
also
for
artistic
achievements
we
felt
it
most
vexatious
to
be
obliged
to
leave
that
very
evening
but
my
husband
managed
to
remain
with
stevenson
till
the
last
available
minute
by
asking
me
to
pack
up
his
things
for
him
i
remember
that
after
reading
the
inland
voyage
i
had
told
my
husband
how
i
had
been
charmed
by
it
and
had
begged
to
be
given
everything
which
came
from
the
same
pen
but
at
that
time
we
were
afraid
that
such
a
delicate
and
refined
talent
would
not
bring
popularity
to
the
author
happily
we
were
mistaken
perhaps
only
to
a
certain
extent
however
as
his
most
successful
works
belong
to
a
later
and
quite
different
genre
at
the
recommendation
of
rajon
we
went
to
a
quaint
little
hotel
in
paris
near
la
muette
well
known
to
artists
and
men
of
letters
and
patronized
for
its
quietness
by
some
of
the
most
famous
being
usually
let
in
apartments
to
persons
who
brought
their
own
servants
with
them
its
situation
close
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
made
our
returns
from
the
exhibition
easy
and
pleasant
so
easy
indeed
that
when
we
had
to
spend
the
evening
in
paris
and
could
find
no
carriage
to
take
us
there
we
merely
went
back
to
our
headquarters
where
we
had
the
choice
of
railway
tramways
and
omnibuses
for
every
part
of
paris
according
to
our
promise
we
went
to
meet
rajon
at
his
studio
and
amongst
other
things
saw
a
beautiful
portrait
of
him
which
however
was
so
much
flattered
that
for
some
time
i
hesitated
about
the
likeness
he
was
represented
on
horseback
with
a
long
flowing
cloak
and
a
sombrero
casting
a
strong
shadow
over
one
of
his
eyes
which
was
afflicted
with
a
weakness
of
the
eyelid
which
kept
dropping
down
so
frequently
that
the
pupil
was
seldom
seen
for
any
time
the
horse
was
a
thoroughbred
two
magnificent
greyhounds
the
originals
we
could
admire
at
rest
upon
a
raised
platform
of
carved
oak
and
red
cushions
ran
alongside
of
him
and
this
dignified
romantic
rider
was
little
spare
merry
rajon
gossip
whispered
that
he
had
been
somewhat
intoxicated
by
his
sudden
fame
and
had
been
for
a
while
desirous
of
showing
off
so
that
he
had
brought
back
from
england
the
thoroughbred
and
the
greyhounds
to
be
noticed
in
the
all√©e
des
cavaliers
but
that
not
having
been
accustomed
to
sit
a
horse
before
his
thoroughbred
had
flung
him
against
a
tree
so
severely
that
the
taste
for
equitation
had
gone
out
of
him
for
ever
be
this
as
it
may
rajon
was
far
from
being
vainglorious
he
knew
his
value
as
an
artist
frankly
and
openly
enjoyed
his
success
but
remained
simple
urbane
and
courteous
he
told
us
that
he
could
only
give
a
day
to
original
work
and
that
his
mother
a
simple
woman
for
whom
art
remained
an
incomprehensible
mystery
could
not
admit
this
limitation
at
that
time
he
was
spending
money
rather
lavishly
giving
in
his
studio
to
celebrated
actors
and
actresses
musicians
singers
poets
and
artists
and
the
expenses
were
sometimes
a
cause
of
momentary
embarrassment
then
his
simple
mother
would
say
why
need
you
trouble
yourself
about
it
you
work
very
little
then
work
twice
as
much
which
wo
tire

out
woolner
arrived
in
paris
a
few
days
after
hamerton
and
they
spent
a
whole
day
together
in
the
sculpture
galleries
of
the
louvre
woolner
remembered
that
old
madame
mohl
having
read
my
husband
works
had
expressed
a
wish
to
renew
the
acquaintance
of
former
days
and
would
be
glad
to
see
us
both
at
any
day
that
might
suit
us
a
week
later
we
called
upon
the
wonderfully
preserved
old
lady
who
was
delighted
to
receive
a
visit
from
a
rising
celebrity
though
a
host
of
celebrities
had
passed
through
her
she
complained
of
being
by
the
young
generation
still
she
remained
lively
and
gracious
her
quick
intelligence
and
ready
memory
were
unimpaired
by
her
great
age
and
it
was
with
eagerness
that
she
seized
upon
another
opportunity
for
narrating
her
stories
of
renowned
people
particularly
of
the
two
amp√®res
whom
she
had
known
intimately
she
was
still
living
in
the
same
house
that
they
had
inhabited
together
when
mohl
kindly
gave
them
the
benefit
of
his
more
practical
sense
in
household
management
madame
mohl
was
rather
severe
about
jean
jacques
amp√®re
whom
she
called
a
young
coxcomb
and
an
egotist
she
was
not
sentimental
and
had
no
sympathy
with
or
pity
for
the
love
so
long
faithful
to
madame
r√©camier
nay
i
thought
i
could
detect
in
her
strictures
the
unconscious
feminine
jealousy
of
a
lady
whose
salon
had
been
forsaken
by
one
of
its
lions
for
a
more
attractive
one
and
who
had
resented
it
bitterly
but
andr√©
marie
amp√®re
she
praised
unreservedly
with
the
warmth
of
most
exalted
admiration
it
was
very
funny
to
see
the
little
lady
curled
up
on
a
couch
propped
by
cushions
running
over
her
strings
of
memories
with
pleased
alacrity
then
jumping
down
in
her
stockings
to
pour
out
tea
for
her
guests
in
utter
disregard
of
her
shoes
which
lay
idly
by
the
sofa
even
when
we
took
leave
of
her
and
as
she
accompanied
us
to
the
door
the
white
stockings
conspicuously
displayed
themselves
at
every
step
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
concealment
at
that
time
black
stockings
would
have
been
thought
an
abomination
almost
every
morning
saw
hamerton
in
the
exhibition
before
the
crowd
of
visitors
arrived
so
that
he
was
able
to
study
in
peace
and
profitably
he
had
had
a
and
cards
of
a
convenient
size
and
thickness
made
especially
to
take
notes
upon
and
he
devoted
a
separate
card
to
every
picture
worth
studying
it
was
a
very
convenient
plan
with
alphabetical
classification
for
references
every
time
he
went
he
took
with
him
a
fresh
supply
and
was
not
encumbered
with
those
he
had
already
filled
up
generally
some
etcher
met
him
by
appointment
and
together
they
selected
pictures
to
be
reproduced
for
the
portfolio
his
evenings
were
mostly
taken
up
by
invitations
and
it
was
well
for
his
wife
that
she
had
been
mercifully
exempted
by
nature
from
jealous
tendencies
for
the
ladies
paid
the
author
of
marmorne
such
a
tribute
of
admiration
that
he
was
sometimes
abashed
by
their
fervor
yet
never
intoxicated
friends
had
repeatedly
told
him
that
he
could
win
the
hearts
of
men
and
if
women
dared
not
say
as
much
of
themselves
they
let
him
see
that
he
exercised
a
great
and
healthy
influence
over
them
too
he
also
enjoyed
their
society
and
though
he
did
not
mean
it
to
be
a
flattery
they
accepted
it
as
such
amongst
artists
and
men
of
letters
he
was
acknowledged
as
a
writer
of
genuine
worth
and
extensive
acquirements
there
is
a
proof
of
it
in
a
letter
addressed
to
him
by
v√©ron
editor
of
on
merely
that
hamerton
must
be
the
writer

more
acquaintances
amongst
artists
were
made
during
his
stay
in
paris
including
bracquemond
protais
waltner
lhermitte
and
munkacsy
having
finished
his
work
in
the
exhibition
my
husband
went
home
to
write
a
notice
of
it
for
the
international
review
in
the
course
of
november
his
eldest
son
stephen
passed
a
successful
examination
for
the
second
part
of
the
and
as
the
boy
was
now
to
study
at
home
his
father
frequently
employed
him
to
write
letters
under
his
dictation
it
was
very
good
practice
for
stephen
and
spared
his
father
time
for
painting
and
drawing
at
the
beginning
of
stevenson
had
sent
a
manuscript
to
hamerton
with
a
request
that
he
would
read
it
and
recommend
it
to
a
publisher
if
it
were
thought
worth
the
trouble
it
was
appreciated
and
a
successful
sale
expected
in
the
interest
of
stevenson
my
husband
advised
him
to
sacrifice
the
idea
of
immediate
payment
and
to
retain
the
copyright
hoping
that
it
would
prove
more
advantageous
however
the
young
author
preferred
the
ready
cash
which
he
may
have
been
in
need
of
nevertheless
acknowledging
afterwards
that
it
would
have
been
preferable
to
have
acted
according
to
the
sound
advice
given
at
the
time
as
our
daughter
was
fast
developing
a
talent
for
music
her
father
felt
tempted
to
resume
the
practice
of
the
violin
regularly
and
they
often
played
duets
and
sonatas
together
but
the
difficulty
nay
the
impossibility
of
finding
time
for
the
prosecution
of
all
the
studies
he
had
undertaken
was
a
source
of
discouragement
because
unavoidably
he
had
to
replace
one
by
another
now
and
then
it
being
impracticable
to
carry
them
on
sometimes
he
complained
that
i
rather
discouraged
than
encouraged
him
about
music
which
was
certainly
true
for
well
knowing
that
to
become
a
violinist
of
any
skill
involves
years
and
years
of
regular
and
steady
practice
i
was
adverse
to
this
additional
strain
leading
to
no
adequate
reward
i
well
knew
it
could
not
be
sustained
and
would
have
to
give
way
to
pressure
from
other
quarters
writing
painting
etching
or
reading
the
study
of
italian
had
also
been
vigorously
resumed
so
that
in
the
diary
i
see
this
note
regularly
practised
spohr
and
kreutzer
or
beethoven
read
dante
i
also
find
the
following
in
april
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
planning
my
new
novel
with
charles
his
worked
on
plan
of
my
novel
and
modified
it
by
talking
it
over
with
my
wife
i
did
not
like
the
plan
which
in
my
opinion
went
too
much
into
the
technicalities
and
details
of
a
young
nobleman
education
i
feared
they
might
prove
tedious
to
the
reader
in
consequence
there
is
a
new
entry
a
week
later
improved
plan
of
novel
with
wife
now
reserve
mornings
exclusively
for
it
or
it
will
never
be
finished
at
all
make
this
a
fixed
rule
at
the
end
of
april
some
monochromes
had
been
sent
for
reproduction
but
he
was
greatly
disappointed
with
them
as
may
be
seen
by
the
diary
may
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
this
month
about
reproductions
of
drawings
in
autotype
dissatisfied
with
the
reproductions
of
the
oil
monochromes
which
came
coarse
with
thousands
of
false
specks
of
light
the
surface
of
a
drawing
should
be
for
autotype
reproduction
this
led
me
to
make
various
experiments
of
various
kinds
and
the
latest
conclusion
i
have
arrived
at
is
something
like
drawing
on
wood
that
is
pencil
or
chalk
going
into
detail
and
sustained
by
washes
of
indian
ink
and
relieved
by
touches
of
chinese
white
the
whole
business
hitherto
has
been
full
of
difficulties
of
various
kinds
june
the
proofs
of
the
autotypes
on
white
paper
with
brown
pigment
arrived
determined
to
have
second
negatives
taken
of
all
of
them
and
to
repaint
them
on
the
positives
to
turn
his
thoughts
away
from
his
repeated
disappointments
in
artistic
attempts
and
to
a
greater
disappointment
in
his
novel
which
he
had
entirely
destroyed
after
bestowing
upon
it
two
months
of
labor
gilbert
began
to
scheme
a
boat
a
river
yacht
it
was
the
best
of
diversions
for
him
as
he
took
as
much
pleasure
in
the
planning
of
a
boat
as
in
the
use
of
it
this
new
one
was
to
be
a
marvel
of
safety
and
speed
but
especially
of
convenience
for
it
would
be
made
to
carry
several
passengers
for
a
month
cruise
with
means
of
taking
meals
on
board
and
of
sleeping
under
a
tent
of
course
seeley
had
been
informed
of
the
scheme
and
wrote
in
answer
do
fail
to
send
me
notice
when
your
boat
may
be
expected
on
the
thames
that
i
may
rouse
the
population
of
kingston
to
give
you
an
appropriate
reception
another
novel
was
begun
but
it
was
still
to
be
the
story
of
a
young
french
nobleman
life
spent
alternately
in
france
and
in
england
and
in
the
manner
of
tom
jones
meanwhile
modern
frenchmen
was
selling
pretty
steadily
but
slowly
the
public
being
mostly
unacquainted
with
the
names
though
lewes
professor
seeley
lockhart
and
many
others
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
work
lockhart
wrote
about
the
biography
of
r√©gnault
i
have
by
me
at
this
moment
your
life
of
henri
r√©gnault
i
trust
you
will
not
consider
it
an
impertinence
if
i
tell
you
how
it
has
delighted
me
both
as
a
man
and
a
painter
i
have
the
most
intense
admiration
for
r√©gnault
and
in
reading
his
biography
it
has
rejoiced
me
to
find
the
author
in
such
thorough
sympathy
with
his
subject
biographies
of
artists
as
a
rule
are
the
most
disappointing
of
books
to
artists
this
is
indeed
an
exception
and
i
most
heartily
congratulate
you
on
your
very
subtle
and
delicate
picture
of
a
noble
life
i
was
in
granada
with
fortuny
when
the
news
of
death
came
i
shall
never
forget
the
impression
it
made
on
us
all
the
fall
of
paris
the
surrender
of
napoleon
all
the
misfortunes
of
france
were
as
nothing
compared
to
this
when
i
first
had
the
book
i
thought
you
a
little
unjust
to
fortuny
and
was
prepared
to
indorse
r√©gnault
estimate
of
him
since
then
i
have
seen
the
thirty
fortunys
at
the
international
exhibition
and
they
have
moderated
my
enthusiasm
and
brought
me
back
to
sober
orthodoxy
to
velasquez
and
rembrandt
lewes
also
wrote
we
left
london
before
your
book
arrived
but
i
sent
for
it
and
lewes
has
been
reading
it
aloud
to
me
the
last
few
evenings
it
has
charmed
us
both
and
we
regret
that
so
good
a
scheme
so
well
carried
out
should
in
the
nature
of
the
case
be
one
doomed
to
meet
with
small
public
response
no
reader
worth
having
can
read
it
without
interest
and
profit
but
de
trouver
des
my
son
writes
in
great
delight
with
it
and
i
have
recommended
it
to
the
one
person
we
have
seen
in
our
solitude
but
i
fear
you
will
find
the
deaf
adder
of
a
public
deafer
than
usual
to
your
charming
a
volume
of
biographies
of
frenchmen
would
have
but
a
slender
chance
of
success
and
a
volume
on
the
unknown
would
need
to
be
spiced
with
religion
or
politics
fortement
to
attract
more
than
a
reader
here
and
there
we
are
here
for
five
weeks
in
our
paradise
the
serpent
symbol
of
visitors
but
alas
without
the
health
which
would
make
the
long
peace
one
filled
with
work
as
for
me
i
vegetate
mostly
i
get
up
at
six
to
stroll
out
for
an
hour
before
breakfast
leaving
madonna
in
bed
with
dante
or
homer
and
quite
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
walks
with
my
cigar
i
get
a
little
reading
done
and
sometimes
write
a
little
but
the
forenoon
is
usually
sauntered
and
pottered
away
when
madonna
has
satisfied
her
inexhaustible
craving
for
knowledge
till
nearly
we
play
then
drive
out
for
two
or
three
hours
music
and
books
till
dinner
after
cigar
and
nap
she
reads
to
me
till
ten
and
i
finish
by
some
light
work
till
eleven
but
i
hope
in
a
week
or
two
to
get
stronger
and
able
to
work
again
the
more
so
as
night
in
which
no
man
can
work
is
fast
approaching
seeley
agreed
with
hamerton
opinion
that
modern
frenchmen
was
one
of
his
best
works
admirably
written
full
of
information
and
interest
professor
seeley
had
also
said
i
wish
english
people
would
take
an
interest
in
such
books
but
i
fear
they
wo
there
ought
to
be
many
such
books
written
lewes
suggested
that
the
other
biographies
in
preparation
should
be
published
separately
in
some
popular
magazine
but
the
author
having
been
discouraged
by
the
coolness
of
the
reception
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
sequel
to
what
had
already
appeared
and
the
material
he
had
been
gathering
on
augustin
thierry
general
castellane
and
arago
remained
useless
the
boat
in
progress
had
been
devised
in
view
of
a
voyage
on
the
rh√¥ne
for
hamerton
who
greatly
admired
the
noble
character
of
the
scenery
in
the
rh√¥ne
valley
had
longed
for
the
opportunity
of
making
it
known
by
an
important
illustrated
work
he
submitted
the
plan
to
seeley
who
answered
i
like
your
rh√¥ne
scheme
it
is
a
grand
subject
but
a
book
on
the
rh√¥ne
should
begin
at
the
rh√¥ne
glacier
and
end
at
the
mediterranean
have
your
ideas
enlarged
to
that
extent
one
can
not
well
omit
the
upper
part
which
the
english
who
travel
in
switzerland
know
so
well
the
rh√¥ne
valley
is
very
picturesque
and
the
exit
of
the
rh√¥ne
from
the
lake
of
geneva
is
a
thing
never
to
be
forgotten
but
do
go
there
to
get
drowned
it
is
horribly
dangerous
for
various
reasons
amongst
others
the
time
required
and
the
outlay
the
idea
of
the
book
entertained
by
hamerton
differed
considerably
from
that
of
seeley
it
was
explained
at
length
and
finally
accepted
in
these
words
i
think
your
plan
of
a
voyage
on
the
navigable
rh√¥ne
with
prologue
and
epilogue
will
do
well
this
plan
however
was
never
realized
owing
to
insurmountable
obstacles
it
was
taken
up
again
and
again
studied
modified
and
regretfully
relinquished
after
several
years
for
that
of
the
sa√¥ne
much
more
practicable
but
still
not
without
its
difficulties
and
now
what
might
have
been
a
great
event
in
the
life
of
hamerton
namely
the
possibility
of
his
election
to
the
chair
of
fine
arts
in
edinburgh
began
to
occupy
his
mind
he
was
strongly
urged
by
his
friends
to
come
forward
as
a
candidate
but
he
hesitated
a
good
deal
for
several
reasons
the
most
important
being
the
necessity
of
two
places
of
residence
for
he
would
not
have
inflicted
upon
my
mother
and
myself
the
pain
of
absolute
separation
still
there
were
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
case
of
success
some
undeniable
advantages
first
of
all
a
fixed
income
and
the
possibility
of
seeing
in
the
course
of
the
necessary
journeys
what
might
be
of
interest
in
london
and
paris
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
attending
more
efficaciously
to
the
portfolio
seeley
who
had
always
endeavored
to
tempt
his
editor
over
to
england
declared
himself
delighted
at
the
prospect
he
had
formerly
sent
such
hints
as
these
i
wish
you
had
a
neat
flying
machine
and
could
pop
over
and
do
the
business
yourself
or
at
cowes
i
thought
of
you
and
said
to
myself
how
much
more
reasonable
it
would
be
for
hamerton
to
have
a
snug
little
house
here
and
a
snug
little
instead
of
living
at
that
preposterous
autun
how
he
would
enjoy
dancing
over
these
waves
which
make
me
sick
to
look
at
them
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
tempt
him
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
kingston
there
are
delightful
cottages
and
villages
to
sketch
in
the
isle
of
wight
and
charming
woodland
scenery
in
the
new
forest
again
when
our
new
house
is
dry
enough
then
you
will
be
obliged
to
come
over
it
will
be
better
than
seeing
the
paris
exhibition
and
when
you
are
once
in
england
you
will
take
a
cottage
at
cowes
and
buy
a
boat
and
never
go
back
to
autun
the
idea
of
becoming
a
candidate
was
first
suggested
by
woolner
after
a
journey
to
edinburgh
where
he
had
heard
some
names
put
forward
for
the
chair
and
amongst
them
that
of
hamerton
which
had
seemed
to
him
the
most
popular
on
his
part
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
strengthen
this
favorable
opinion
by
spreading
what
he
knew
of
his
friend
not
only
as
an
artist
and
cultured
man
of
letters
but
also
as
a
sociable
conversationalist
capable
of
enjoying
intercourse
with
his
in
moments
of
leisure
and
he
took
care
to
let
my
husband
know
that
this
point
was
of
importance
the
new
professor
being
expected
to
exercise
hospitality
so
as
to
create
a
sort
of
centre
for
the
gathering
of
he
said
he
had
heard
of
a
good
income
of
light
duties
and
of
the
almost
certainty
of
success
in
case
hamerton
should
present
himself
professor
masson
had
also
suggested
to
macmillan
that
many
persons
in
edinburgh
would
like
to
secure
the
best
man
in
hamerton
and
craik
wrote
about
it
you
would
be
an
ornament
to
the
university
and
might
do
useful
and
important
work
there
for
many
reasons
the
scotch
professorships
are
enviable
for
this
particularly
that
the
session
is
a
short
one
and
would
require
short
residence
it
will
be
pleasant
for
all
of
us
your
friends
if
you
go
to
edinburgh
for
it
will
compel
you
to
come
to
england
and
be
seen
seeley
was
also
of
opinion
that
no
man
ought
to
be
wholly
dependent
upon
literary
labor
it
tries
the
head
too
much
all
the
friends
who
were
consulted
by
my
husband
answered
that
they
considered
him
perfectly
adapted
for
the
situation
apart
from
friendly
motives

you

my

that
is
on

its

the

the

the

is
scarcely
ever
to

way
of

have
no

miss
susan
hamerton
also
pressed
her
nephew
to
offer
himself
for
the
chair
and
indulged
in
bright
hopes
of
frequent
meetings
the
result
was
that
after
a
long
talk
with
me
on
march
my
husband
determined
to
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
and
although
he
did
it
without
much
enthusiasm
he
began
immediately
to
prepare
himself
for
the
new
duties
that
would
be
involved
first
of
all
he
told
me
that
his
knowledge
of
the
history
of
art
was
insufficient
and
would
require
additional
researches
his
plan
was
to
go
to
greece
first
then
to
italy
another
year
he
would
go
to
holland
and
belgium
then
to
spain
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
this
programme
as
i
reflected
that
the
income
from
the
professorship
would
hardly
cover
our
travelling
expenses
and
that
very
little
time
would
be
left
for
literary
work
if
the
lectures
required
so
much
preparation
however
i
only
begged
him
to
wait
for
the
result
of
the
election
before
he
undertook
anything
in
view
of
it
he
agreed
and
turned
his
thoughts
towards
the
graphic
arts
and
a
new
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
in
the
beginning
of
april
hamerton
attended
with
his
family
the
wedding
of
charles
gindriez
his
and
was
well
pleased
with
the
young
lady
who
thus
became
a
new
member
in
the
gatherings
at
la
tuilerie
three
days
later
his
elder
son
stephen
started
for
algiers
where
he
had
an
appointment
at
the
lyc√©e
for
some
time
past
the
two
great
political
parties
at
autun
had
been
at
daggers
drawn
and
the
proprietors
of
the
conservative
paper
had
brought
from
paris
a
skilful
and
unscrupulous
political
writer
to
crush
its
opponents
and
to
effect
the
ruin
of
the
rival
paper
la
r√©publique
du
morvan
by
fair
means
or
foul
the
first
stabs
dealt
by
the
new
pen
were
directed
against
notable
residents
and
being
a
good
fencer
and
a
good
shot
in
fact
a
sort
of
bravo
tremplier
the
wielder
of
the
pen
proclaimed
loudly
after
every
libel
that
he
was
ready
to
maintain
what
he
advanced
at
the
point
of
the
sword
and
to
give
a
meeting
to
all
adversaries
unacquainted
with
the
real
social
standing
of
hamerton
in
autun
but
knowing
that
he
was
pr√©sident
honoraire
du
cercle
national
a
liberal
institution
patronized
by
the
and
republican
deputies
tremplier
thought
it
would
be
a
to
defame
his
character
by
accusing
him
of
being
the
author
of
some
anonymous
articles
against
the
clergy
which
had
appeared
in
la
r√©publique
du
morvan
though
greatly
irritated
by
this
unfair
attack
my
husband
contrived
to
keep
his
temper
and
simply
denied
the
accusation
this
denial
was
indorsed
by
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
in
which
the
articles
had
been
published
and
the
disagreeable
incident
was
expected
to
end
there
but
this
would
not
have
satisfied
the
truculent
tremplier
and
in
the
next
number
of
his
paper
he
expressed
in
arrogant
terms
an
utter
disbelief
in
hamerton
denial
and
venomously
attacked
him
for
his
nationality
literary
pretensions
winding
up
his
diatribe
as
usual
by
a
challenge
this
was
too
much
and
my
husband
resolved
to
start
for
autun
immediately
and
to
horsewhip
the
scoundrel
as
he
deserved
pickering
an
english
artist
and
friend
of
ours
who
happened
to
be
at
la
tuilerie
offered
to
assist
my
husband
by
keeping
the
ground
clear
while
he
administered
the
punishment
for
tremplier
notwithstanding
his
bravado
deemed
it
prudent
to
surround
himself
with
a
bevy
of
officers
and
was
seldom
to
be
met
alone
i
was
strongly
opposed
to
this
course
and
at
last
i
prevailed
upon
my
husband
to
abandon
it
by
representing
that
he
was
being
drawn
into
a
snare
for
no
doubt
tremplier
was
only
waiting
for
the
attempt
at
violence
he
had
provoked
to
get
his
victim
seized
and
imprisoned
so
as
to
be
able
ever
after
to
stigmatize
him
with
the
terrible
phrase
un
homme
qui
a
fait
de
la
prison
this
would
be
undeniable
and
as
people
never
inquire
un
homme
a
fait
de
la
prison
it
is
as
well
to
avoid
it
altogether
we
agreed
upon
a
different
policy
and
resolved
to
prosecute
the
autunois
for
libel
and
immediately
set
off
to
retain
a
advocate
who
belonged
to
the
conservative
party
and
was
said
to
be
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
autunois
he
knew
my
husband
personally
and
also
knew
that
he
was
incapable
of
having
written
the
anonymous
articles
still
less
capable
of
telling
a
lie
and
as
we
felt
sure
of
his
own
honorable
character
we
boldly
asked
him
to
defend
a
political
opponent
this
was
putting
him
in
a
very
delicate
situation
and
he
complained
of
it
at
once
but
my
husband
insisted
and
said
that
he
could
not
fairly
shun
this
duty
vainly
did
this
gentleman
supported
by
the
pr√©sident
du
tribunal
and
other
notabilities
of
the
same
party
try
to
dissuade
hamerton
from
seeking
redress
by
saying
that
no
one
attached
the
slightest
importance
to
such
libels
that
he
was
too
much
above
tremplier
to
resent
anything
that
came
from
his
mercenary
pen
that
his
character
was
unimpeachable
etc
he
was
even
warned
that
he
had
not
the
remotest
chance
of
a
verdict
in
his
favor
because
he
could
not
prove
that
he
was
not
the
author
of
the
objectionable
articles
i
should
have
thought
that
tremplier
would
be
called
upon
to
prove
that
i
had
written
them
he
answered
anyhow
if
i
ca
count
upon
justice
here
i
will
appeal
to
the
court
at
dijon
seeing
that
his
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
he
was
asked
what
would
satisfy
him
and
he
answered
an
apology
from
tremplier
in
the
and
tremplier
had
to
submit
to
the
orders
of
the
keepers
of
the
he
did
it
with
a
bad
grace
but
he
had
to
do
it
one
of
the
articles
attributed
to
hamerton
had
been
directed
against
the
bishop
of
autun
whom
he
highly
esteemed
and
there
was
much
curiosity
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
prelate
himself
that
opinion
was
soon
publicly
expressed
by
a
visit
from
this
dignitary
of
the
roman
catholic
church
to
the
protestant
tenant
of
la
tuilerie
on
receiving
monseigneur
perraud
i
thanked
him
first
for
his
good
opinion
of
which
i
had
never
doubted
knowing
him
to
be
a
reader
of
my
husband
works
and
also
because
there
was
no
fear
that
a
man
of
his
culture
could
believe
the
anonymous
articles
to
be
written
by
the
author
of
the
biography
of
perreyve
in
modern
frenchmen
monseigneur
perraud
answered
that
my
husband
character
and
literary
talent
were
so
much
above
question
that
he
would
never
have
given
a
thought
to
this
affair
had
it
not
been
that
the
autunois
was
often
called
le
journal
de
though
in
fact
the
bishop
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
with
its
editor
tremplier
whom
he
had
never
consented
to
receive
but
unwilling
to
allow
the
possibility
of
any
doubt
to
remain
in
other
people
minds
he
had
taken
this
opportunity
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
my
husband
and
of
giving
a
proof
of
his
high
regard
for
him
monseigneur
perraud
had
a
reputation
for
freezing
dignity
which
kept
many
people
aloof
but
he
talked
quite
freely
with
my
husband
dignity
he
certainly
possessed
in
an
unusual
degree
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
hamerton
but
it
was
no
bar
to
interesting
intercourse
nor
to
brotherly
sympathy
as
we
found
afterwards
in
sorrowful
circumstances
this
first
visit
certainly
enhanced
the
high
opinion
which
each
had
formed
of
the
other
and
subsequent
meetings
confirmed
the
interest
they
found
in
each
other
views
and
sentiments
i
mentioned
pickering
in
connection
with
the
affair
of
the
autunois
and
it
may
now
be
explained
that
after
reading
round
my
house
he
had
fancied
he
should
like
to
see
the
scenery
described
in
the
book
as
it
would
probably
afford
him
paintable
subjects
although
the
name
of
the
neighboring
town
was
not
given
and
though
great
changes
had
been
made
by
the
construction
of
a
railway
since
the
publication
of
the
book
pickering
lighted
upon
autun
as
the
very
place
he
was
in
search
of
he
soon
made
my
husband
acquaintance
and
a
friendship
between
them
was
rapidly
established
woolner
who
had
kept
up
for
some
months
a
brisk
correspondence
in
behalf
of
hamerton
candidature
now
heard
that
matters
were
not
going
so
smoothly
as
he
had
expected
he
was
told
that
the
income
would
not
come
up
to
the
sum
stated
at
first
that
the
formation
of
an
art
museum
was
contemplated
in
which
case
the
duties
of
forming
and
keeping
it
would
devolve
upon
the
professor
there
was
also
a
desire
that
the
students
should
receive
technical
instruction
and
lastly
it
was
rumored
that
forty
lectures
a
year
would
be
required
in
fact
hamerton
began
to
regret
that
he
had
offered
himself
for
the
post
without
knowing
exactly
what
he
would
be
expected
to
do
whilst
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
was
advised
to
go
to
edinburgh
in
order
to
call
upon
each
of
the
electors
no
one
acquainted
with
his
character
could
have
imagined
for
an
instant
that
he
would
comply
the
electors
he
said
to
me
must
be
acquainted
with
my
works
i
have
sent
nearly
fifty
testimonials
given
by
eminent
artists
men
of
letters
and
publishers
i
consider
this
as
sufficient
to
enable
the
electors
to
judge
of
the
capacities
for
which
an
art
professor
ought
to
be
chosen
if
these
are
judged
insufficient
my
presence
could
not
give
them
more
weight
i
find
this
simple
entry
in
the
diary
july
got
news
that
i
was
not
elected
and
though
he
may
have
regretted
the
time
wasted
in
this
fruitless
attempt
i
am
convinced
that
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
delightful
relief
when
no
longer
dreading
encroachments
upon
his
liberty
to
work
as
he
thought
fit
footnote
it
was
also
seeley
opinion
when
he
wrote
you
have
felt
so
much
doubt
as
to
the
effect
of
such
a
change
of
life
upon
your
health
that
the
decision
may
come
as
a
relief
to
you
after
all
there
remained
to
him
as
a
lasting
compensation
the
tokens
of
flattering
regard
for
his
character
and
of
appreciation
of
his
talents
given
in
the
numerous
testimonials

the
testimonials
are
too
numerous
to
be
given
here
but
they
all
agreed
in
the
expressed
opinion
that
hamerton
would
be
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
or
the
very
man
although
the
life
of
turner
had
first
appeared
in
the
portfolio
it
was
again
well
received
by
the
public
in
book
form
and
greatly
praised
by
the
press
particularly
in
america
the
boston
courier
said
we
have
found
this
volume
thoroughly
fascinating
and
think
that
no
reader
of
painters
should
neglect
to
read
this
life
in
it
he
will
find
turner
dethroned
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
on
which
ruskin
had
set
him
greatly
to
the
disadvantage
but
he
will
also
find
him
placed
on
another
reasonably
high
pedestal
where
one
may
admire
him
intelligently
and
lovingly
in
spite
of
the
defects
in
drawing
the
occasional
lapses
in
coloring
and
the
other
peculiarities
which
are
made
clear
to
his
observation
by
hamerton
discussion
he
had
found
it
a
difficult
subject
to
treat
because
of
the
paucity
of
incidents
in
turner
life
but
the
painter
genius
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
upon
him
in
his
earlier
years
that
he
had
eagerly
studied
his
works
and
sought
information
about
his
personality
from
the
friends
who
had
at
some
time
or
other
been
acquainted
with
the
marvellous
artist
i
believe
that
my
husband
hardly
ever
went
to
the
national
gallery
without
visiting
the
turner
room
and
that
is
saying
much
for
during
his
sojourns
in
london
he
seldom
missed
going
every
day
it
was
open
and
sometimes
he
went
twice
once
in
the
morning
and
again
in
the
afternoon
great
as
was
his
admiration
of
turner
oil
pictures
i
believe
it
was
equalled
by
his
delight
in
the
same
master
and
drawings
when
in
the
lower
rooms
where
they
are
exhibited
he
could
hardly
be
prevailed
upon
to
go
upstairs
again
and
i
had
to
plead
fatigue
and
hunger
to
recall
him
to
the
realities
of
life
although
his
appreciation
of
constable
was
high
it
could
not
be
compared
to
what
he
felt
for
turner
because
turner
was
so
wide
in
range
that
he
was
the
opposite
of
constable
whose
art
was
the
expression
of
intense
affection
for
one
locality
chapter
xv
third
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
the
graphic
arts
human
intercourse
once
rid
of
the
perturbation
occasioned
by
the
affair
of
the
election
hamerton
was
free
to
devote
himself
energetically
to
the
preparation
of
a
new
and
splendid
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
for
which
he
spared
neither
thought
nor
pains
being
generously
entrusted
by
macmillan
with
the
necessary
funds
and
given
for
the
arrangement
craik
had
said
in
a
letter
dated
we
are
disposed
to
make
it
a
very
fine
book
and
not
to
grudge
the
outlay
we
must
leave
all
the
details
for
you
to
arrange
in
another
of
may
he
said
again
we
are
particularly
anxious
to
make
it
a
beautiful
book
and
i
think
the
plan
of
making
each
edition
completely
different
from
the
preceding
gives
it
an
interest
and
value
that
will
make
the
book
always
sought
after
the
first
edition
is
a
scarce
and
valuable
book
the
second
will
rise
in
value
being
allowed
to
do
exactly
as
he
liked
the
author
of
etching
and
etchers
set
to
his
task
with
delightful
anticipation
of
the
result
at
the
same
time
he
was
also
giving
a
good
deal
of
time
to
the
annotation
of
certain
engravings
and
etchings
presented
by
himself
and
some
friends
to
the
manchester
museum
in
which
he
took
great
interest
when
the
vacation
brought
the
boys
home
in
august
it
was
decided
to
have
a
trial
trip
on
the
sa√¥ne
in
the
morvandelle
but
after
behaving
well
enough
on
the
water
she
filled
and
sank
at
anchor
whilst
her
captain
was
quietly
enjoying
dinner
with
his
sons
at
the
nearest
inn
the
boat
being
made
of
wood
and
divided
into
a
great
many
compartments
to
hold
stores
and
luggage
let
the
water
into
those
compartments
as
the
wood
dried
and
shrank
it
became
therefore
necessary
to
exchange
the
wooden
tubes
for
iron
ones
for
it
was
a
double
boat
so
the
crew
had
to
come
back
home
and
hamerton
sent
to
a
periodical
a
relation
of
his
impressions
and
adventures
in
this
brief
voyage
and
shipwreck
in
the
summer
there
was
an
exhibition
at
the
glasgow
institute
of
fine
arts
and
my
husband
was
asked
to
send
something
if
possible
but
being
almost
overwhelmed
with
work
he
was
obliged
to
decline
the
invitation
walker
the
secretary
of
the
institute
wrote
to
say
how
sorry
he
was
not
to
have
his
name
in
the
catalogue
and
added
our
collection
of
etchings
is
very
good
and
during
the
short
time
we
have
been
open
the
people
of
glasgow
have
learned
more
about
etching
than
ever
they
knew
before
your
book
has
been
a
source
of
infinite
delight
to
many
here
a
short
time
ago
we
all
hoped
to
have
you
among
us
the
loss
is
ours
sometimes
i
trust
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
glasgow
you
would
find
us
not
altogether
wanting
in
appreciation
of
what
is
right
in
art
and
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
people
here
who
believe
that
ledgers
are
not
the
only
books
worth
studying
although
the
portfolio
was
now
generally
acknowledged
to
be
at
the
head
of
artistic
periodicals
in
england
it
was
the
desire
of
both
its
editor
and
publisher
to
improve
it
still
further
in
one
of
his
letters
craik
had
said
what
an
important
part
the
is
playing
i
believe
you
are
affecting
the
public
and
compelling
them
to
recognize
the
best
things
in
a
way
they
never
did
before
i
think
your
conduct
of
the
monthly
admirable
it
was
now
proposed
to
add
to
its
artistic
value
by
giving
more
original
etchings
hitherto
the
peculiar
uncertainty
of
the
art
of
etching
had
hindered
the
realization
of
this
desire
for
there
being
no
certainty
about
the
quality
of
an
etching
from
a
picture
the
risk
is
immensely
increased
when
a
commission
is
given
for
an
original
etching
the
celebrity
of
an
etcher
and
his
previous
achievements
can
only
give
hopes
that
he
be
successful
once
more
but
these
hopes
are
far
from
a
certainty
even
such
artists
as
rajon
and
jacquemart
to
mention
only
two
of
the
most
eminent
who
constantly
delighted
the
lovers
of
art
by
masterpieces
of
skill
and
artistic
feeling
and
were
moreover
painters
themselves
were
not
safe
against
failure
and
repeated
failure
even
in
copying
when
a
commission
has
been
given
to
an
artist
the
stipulated
price
has
to
be
paid
whether
the
result
is
a
success
or
a
failure
unless
the
artist
himself
acknowledges
the
failure
a
very
rare
occurrence
at
best
he
admits
that
some
retouching
is
desirable
and
consents
to
undertake
it
but
too
often
with
the
result
that
the
plate
loses
all
freshness
such
considerations
and
many
more
made
it
necessary
for
the
publisher
and
editor
of
the
portfolio
to
discuss
the
subject
at
length
and
without
hurry
in
addition
to
the
affairs
of
the
portfolio
there
was
the
choice
of
illustrations
for
the
book
on
the
graphic
arts
which
was
to
be
published
by
seeley
and
for
which
the
presence
of
the
author
in
london
was
almost
a
necessity
it
was
then
decided
that
both
our
boys
having
situations
we
would
take
our
daughter
with
us
and
seek
for
lodgings
somewhere
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
probably
at
kew
and
seeley
with
their
usual
kindness
invited
us
to
stay
with
them
until
we
had
found
convenient
accommodation
we
started
in
october
and
as
soon
as
we
reached
paris
we
heard
from
our
younger
son
richard
that
he
was
far
from
pleased
with
his
present
situation
instead
of
having
to
devote
only
a
few
hours
a
day
to
teaching
english
as
he
had
been
promised
the
whole
of
his
time
was
taken
up
by
the
usual
drudgery
which
is
the
lot
of
an
so
that
he
could
not
study
for
himself
the
first
thing
his
father
did
was
to
set
him
free
from
that
bondage
and
to
devise
the
best
means
to
enable
him
to
pursue
the
study
of
painting
which
the
boy
wished
to
follow
as
a
profession
they
went
together
to
consult
jean
paul
laurens
who
said
that
the
most
efficacious
way
would
be
not
to
study
under
one
master
but
to
go
to
one
of
juan
ateliers
where
students
get
the
benefit
of
sound
advice
from
several
leading
artists
in
conformity
with
this
counsel
my
husband
saw
juan
and
after
learning
from
him
the
names
of
the
artists
visiting
the
particular
atelier
where
richard
was
to
study
he
got
him
recommended
to
jules
lefebvre
and
to
g√©r√¥me
by
an
intimate
friend
paul
rajon
as
usual
did
not
fail
to
call
upon
us
and
we
were
very
sorry
to
notice
a
great
change
for
the
worse
in
his
appearance
he
said
he
had
been
very
ill
lately
and
was
still
far
from
well
he
seemed
to
have
lost
all
his
buoyancy
of
spirits
and
to
look
careworn
he
alluded
to
pecuniary
difficulties
resulting
from
the
early
death
of
his
which
left
his
sister
and
a
child
i
believe
entirely
dependent
upon
him
without
reckoning
on
adverse
fortune
or
he
had
built
himself
a
house
with
a
fine
studio
at
to
escape
from
the
incessant
interruptions
to
his
work
when
in
paris
but
of
course
the
outlay
had
been
heavier
than
he
had
intended
it
to
be
and
these
cares
made
him
rather
anxious
being
very
good
friends
we
had
formerly
received
confidences
from
him
about
the
dissatisfaction
created
by
the
loneliness
of
his
home
and
the
want
of
a
strong
affection
in
spite
of
his
success
in
society
and
the
flattering
smiles
and
speeches
of
renowned
beauties
in
answer
to
my
suggestion
that
marriage
would
perhaps
give
him
what
he
wanted
he
had
answered
no
doubt
but
where
shall
i
find
the
wife
the
girl
i
introduce
into
society
as
wife
must
be
very
beautiful
else
what
would
society
think
of
my
taste
as
an
artist
she
must
also
be
above
the
average
in
intelligence
to
meet
with
the
and
keep
her
proper
place
and
lastly
she
must
also
be
wealthy
for
my
earnings
are
not
sufficient
for
the
frame
i
desire
to
show
her
in
he
was
quite
serious
but
i
laughed
and
said
i
beg
to
alter
my
opinion
of
your
wants
the
wife
you
describe
would
be
the
mere
satisfaction
of
your
vanity
and
if
you
were
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
the
gifts
of
beauty
intelligence
and
wealth
in
the
same
person
it
would
be
very
exacting
to
expect
that
in
addition
to
all
these
she
should
be
domestic
to
minister
to
your
home
comforts
and
sufficiently
devoted
for
your
need
of
affection
i
told
you
i
thought
it
very
difficult
he
sighed
if
you
take
other
people
opinion
about
the
choice
of
a
wife
my
husband
said
you
are
not
ripe
for
matrimony
no
man
ought
to
get
married
unless
he
feels
that
he
can
not
help
it
that
he
could
not
live
happily
without
the
companionship
of
a
particular
woman
there
had
been
an
interval
of
a
few
years
between
this
conversation
and
our
present
meeting
but
rajon
had
not
forgotten
it
for
he
said
with
a
shade
of
sadness
it
is
now
hamerton
that
i
feel
the
want
of
a
domestic
and
devoted
wife
such
as
you
advised
me
to
choose
but
marriage
is
out
of
the
question
i
am
an
invalid
we
tried
to
cheer
him
up
and
my
husband
serene
philosophy
seemed
to
do
him
good
he
repeated
to
paul
rajon
his
usual
comparison
of
the
events
of
life
to
a
very
good
cup
of
coffee
to
which
a
pinch
of
salt
is
always
added
before
we
are
allowed
to
taste
it
your
reputation
and
talent
he
said
make
a
capital
cup
of
coffee
but
your
illness
has
seasoned
it
with
rather
a
heavy
pinch
of
salt
the
journey
to
england
was
got
through
without
any
serious
accident
to
my
husband
health
but
we
had
to
be
very
careful
in
adhering
to
our
rules
of
slow
trains
and
night
travelling
and
frequent
stoppages
it
was
the
first
visit
of
our
daughter
to
england
and
her
father
watched
her
impressions
with
great
interest
she
spoke
english
timidly
and
reluctantly
but
seeley
was
so
kindly
encouraging
that
she
overcame
her
timidity
seeley
received
us
in
his
pretty
newly
built
house
at
kingston
which
being
quite
in
the
country
and
very
quiet
suited
my
tastes
admirably
the
proximity
of
a
beautiful
park
was
very
tempting
for
rambles
and
when
at
leisure
we
much
enjoyed
going
all
together
for
a
stroll
under
its
noble
trees
seeley
and
his
friend
sometimes
went
off
to
london
together
in
the
morning
but
it
was
more
desirable
for
my
husband
to
go
to
town
only
in
the
afternoon
because
he
felt
less
and
less
nervous
as
the
day
wore
on
and
was
quite
himself
in
the
evening
we
left
kingston
to
go
and
stay
for
a
few
days
with
and
macmillan
the
evenings
after
macmillan
return
from
business
were
very
animated
with
conversation
and
music
sometimes
macmillan
gave
us
some
scotch
and
gaelic
songs
with
remarkable
pathos
and
power
and
invariably
after
every
one
else
had
retired
he
remained
talking
intimately
often
confidentially
with
my
husband
far
into
the
night
a
pretty
incident
occurred
before
we
left
knapdale
one
afternoon
we
found
macmillan
very
busy
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
an
embroidered
and
baby
frock
intended
as
a
present
to
her
husband
first
grandchild
on
his
first
visit
to
knapdale
which
was
to
be
on
that
very
day
after
dinner
the
little
man
made
his
appearance
in
the
decorated
frock
and
took
his
place
upon
his
shoulders
then
we
all
formed
a
procession
headed
by
the
still
erect
form
of
the
grandsire
supporting
the
infant
hope
of
the
family
and
leading
us
parents
relatives
and
guests
to
the
cheerful
domain
of
the
cook
she
proudly
received
the
company
standing
ladle
in
hand
by
an
enormous
earthen
vessel
containing
a
tempting
mixture
in
which
candied
fruits
currants
and
spices
seemed
to
predominate
we
were
expected
every
one
to
bring
this
medley
to
greater
perfection
by
turning
over
a
portion
of
it
with
the
ladle
it
was
duly
offered
first
to
the
little
stranger
whose
grandsire
seized
and
plunged
it
into
the
savory
depths
whilst
the
tiny
baby
hand
was
tenderly
laid
upon
his
own
the
second
part
of
the
ceremony
tasting
had
likewise
to
be
performed
by
proxy
for
the
young
scion
of
the
house
peremptorily
refused
to
trifle
with
any
temptation
in
the
form
of
mincemeat
we
all
in
succession
performed
the
ancient
rite
and
my
husband
said
to
me
afterwards
what
a
capital
subject
for
a
picture
of
family
portraits
the
scene
would
afford
the
contrast
in
the
attire
of
the
cook
and
her
maids
with
the
toilettes
of
the
ladies
together
with
the
picturesque
background
of
the
bright
kitchen
utensils
made
a
subject
in
the
style
of
an
old
dutch
master
with
a
touch
of
modern
sentiment
after
seeing
different
places
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
we
decided
again
for
kew
but
this
time
we
required
larger
lodgings
not
only
on
account
of
mary
but
also
for
miss
susan
hamerton
and
our
cousins
ben
and
annie
hinde
whom
we
had
invited
to
join
us
there
they
had
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
and
our
meeting
was
happy
and
cheerful
we
had
been
very
fortunate
in
our
lodgings
which
were
spacious
clean
and
with
a
good
view
of
the
green
our
landlady
was
a
very
respectable
and
obliging
person
and
she
let
us
have
when
we
wished
the
use
of
a
chaise
and
a
little
pony
which
greatly
added
to
aunt
susan
enjoyment
of
the
country
for
her
nephew
drove
her
to
the
prettiest
places
in
the
neighborhood
and
through
richmond
park
whenever
the
weather
allowed
it
the
beautiful
gardens
received
almost
a
daily
visit
from
us
and
were
a
most
agreeable
as
well
as
a
convenient
resort
for
our
aged
aunt
as
she
could
either
walk
in
the
open
grounds
when
it
was
mild
enough
or
else
visit
the
numerous
if
she
found
the
outside
air
too
keen
for
her
we
had
been
fortunate
in
this
choice
of
kew
for
our
temporary
residence
not
only
did
we
like
the
place
in
itself
but
we
met
with
so
hospitable
and
flattering
a
reception
from
several
resident
families
that
they
contrived
to
make
us
feel
unlike
strangers
among
them
and
ever
after
our
thoughts
turned
back
to
that
time
with
mingled
feelings
of
regret
pleasure
and
gratitude
and
whenever
we
came
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
moving
to
england
kew
was
always
the
place
named
as
being
preferred
by
both
of
us
here
we
again
met
professor
oliver
whom
my
husband
had
known
since
he
came
to
kew
alone
for
the
first
time
being
greatly
interested
in
painting
and
possessing
a
collection
of
fine
by
alfred
hunt
he
took
pleasure
in
showing
them
to
hamerton
as
well
as
the
herbarium
of
which
he
was
director
professor
church
and
his
wife
showed
themselves
most
friendly
and
untiringly
hospitable
very
interesting
and
distinguished
people
were
to
be
met
at
their
house
where
the
master
was
ever
willing
to
display
before
his
guests
some
of
his
valuable
collections
of
jewels
rare
tissues
old
laces
and
japanese
bronzes
we
often
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
at
this
friendly
house
thiselton
dyer
now
director
of
kew
gardens
and
his
wife
the
daughter
of
sir
john
hooker
a
most
charming
person
who
reminded
both
of
us
of
the
lovely
women
immortalized
by
reynolds
illustration
the
third
edition
of
etching
and
etchers
now
on
sale
had
fulfilled
all
expectations
and
was
universally
admired
and
praised
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
the
author
who
had
never
before
enjoyed
such
a
complete
recognition
his
reputation
and
popularity
increased
rapidly
and
if
he
had
liked
he
would
have
been
a
good
deal
lionized
but
although
far
from
insensible
to
this
success
he
remained
true
to
his
studious
habits
going
with
seeley
to
the
national
gallery
british
or
kensington
museums
to
choose
illustrations
for
the
graphic
arts
or
quietly
writing
at
his
lodgings
and
only
accepting
invitations
from
his
friends
and
publishers
in
december
macmillan
gave
a
dinner
at
the
garrick
club
in
honor
of
the
author
of
etching
and
etchers
who
was
warmly
congratulated
by
the
other
guests
invited
to
meet
him
i
have
still
in
my
possession
the
menu
belonging
to
alma
tadenia
who
said
to
my
husband
i
dare
say
hamerton
would
like
to
have
a
of
this
evening
present
her
with
this
in
my
name
and
he
handed
his
menu
on
the
back
of
which
he
had
quickly
and
cleverly
drawn
a
little
likeness
of
himself
in
caricature
and
the
guests
had
signed
their
names
on
it
a
facsimile
is
given
on
the
opposite
page
as
he
had
given
us
an
invitation
to
visit
his
curious
house
we
did
not
fail
to
go
and
mary
was
especially
attracted
by
the
famous
grand
piano
inscribed
inside
with
the
signatures
of
the
renowned
musicians
who
had
performed
upon
it
knowing
that
our
daughter
was
seriously
studying
music
alma
tadema
generously
expressed
the
hope
of
seeing
sometime
the
signature
of
miss
hamerton
by
the
side
of
the
other
names
my
husband
also
took
mary
to
woolner
and
she
enjoyed
greatly
the
society
of
the
children
who
spoke
french
very
creditably
and
who
were
interested
in
the
details
she
could
give
them
about
french
life
and
ways
they
took
her
to
their
father
studios
and
showed
her
his
works
when
came
however
she
was
unprepared
for
being
waited
upon
by
her
new
friends
and
in
consequence
felt
somewhat
ill
at
ease
it
was
a
fancy
of
woolner
to
make
his
children
wait
upon
his
guests
they
offered
bread
and
wine
and
directed
the
maids
their
duty
consisting
chiefly
in
seeing
that
every
guest
received
perfect
attendance
it
reminded
one
of
the
pages
service
in
mediaeval
times
and
was
accepted
by
people
of
mature
age
as
a
gracious
courtesy
of
their
host
though
it
proved
rather
embarrassing
to
a
girl
of
fifteen
i
do
know
how
long
the
custom
prevailed
but
i
did
not
notice
it
in
succeeding
years
our
cousin
ben
hinde
had
joined
us
only
for
a
few
days
his
duties
as
a
clergyman
not
allowing
of
a
long
absence
but
our
meeting
had
been
very
pleasant
and
cordial
he
had
left
with
us
his
sister
annie
to
whom
my
husband
endeavored
to
show
what
was
most
worthy
of
attention
in
the
metropolis
and
just
as
we
were
thus
enjoying
our
fragrant
cup
of
coffee
the
pinch
of
salt
was
thrown
into
it
with
a
heavy
hand
for
we
heard
from
richard
that
he
was
lying
so
dangerously
ill
that
he
could
not
move
in
bed
he
had
only
written
a
few
words
in
pencil
to
let
us
know
that
the
doctor
thought
our
presence
unnecessary
because
the
danger
would
be
past
or
the
illness
prove
fatal
before
we
could
arrive
of
course
my
first
impulse
was
to
rush
to
my
poor
boy
bedside
but
what
was
to
become
of
mary
a
girl
of
fifteen
unused
to
english
ways
and
speaking
english
still
imperfectly
perhaps
our
aunt
who
was
to
leave
us
in
a
few
days
would
stay
a
little
longer
though
the
approach
of
christmas
made
it
imperative
for
her
companion
to
get
back
to
the
vicarage
as
soon
as
possible
but
my
husband
could
i
think
of
leaving
him
a
prey
to
this
terrible
anxiety
and
to
all
the
dangers
of
a
return
of
the
old
nervous
attacks
i
saw
how
he
dreaded
the
mere
possibility
though
he
never
said
a
word
to
influence
my
decision
but
the
threatening
insomnia
and
restlessness
had
already
made
their
appearance
and
warned
me
that
i
ought
to
stay
near
him
i
wrote
to
my
best
friend
in
paris
begging
her
to
send
her
own
doctor
to
our
poor
boy
and
to
let
me
know
the
whole
truth
immediately
the
answer
was
reassuring
the
crisis
was
past
there
was
nothing
to
fear
now
only
the
patient
would
remain
weak
for
some
time
and
would
require
great
care
his
friends
particularly
one
of
them
a
student
of
medicine
had
nursed
him
intelligently
and
devotedly
as
soon
as
he
could
take
a
little
food
my
friend
sent
him
delicacies
and
old
wines
and
when
he
could
bear
the
railway
he
went
to
his
grandmother
to
await
our
return
home
we
breathed
again
and
aunt
susan
and
annie
left
us
comparatively
quiet
in
mind
my
husband
now
went
on
with
his
work
as
fast
as
possible
for
he
longed
to
see
his
younger
son
again
when
his
notes
for
the
graphic
arts
were
completed
we
made
a
round
of
visits
to
take
leave
of
our
friends
and
after
another
short
stay
at
knapdale
where
we
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
lockyer
and
another
very
pleasant
pilgrimage
to
and
palmer
hermitage
we
set
off
for
paris
seeley
wrote
shortly
after
our
arrival
in
the
french
capital
about
several
matters
connected
with
the
portfolio
and
added
how
will
you
be
able
to
settle
down
again
in
that
little
autun
you
will
feel
as
robert
montgomery
said
of
himself
in
glasgow
like
an
oak
in
a
no
the
oak
liked
to
feel
the
pure
air
of
the
morvan
hills
blowing
about
its
head
and
to
spread
its
branches
in
unconfined
space
it
was
in
great
crowded
cities
that
it
felt
the
pressure
of
the
on
arriving
at
home
we
found
richard
well
again
and
gifted
with
an
extraordinary
appetite
which
was
the
restorative
he
most
needed
having
grown
very
thin
and
weak
through
his
illness
my
husband
had
been
very
desirous
to
present
me
with
a
of
the
success
of
etching
and
etchers
and
pressed
me
to
choose
a
trinket
either
a
bracelet
or
a
brooch
but
i
thought
what
i
possessed
already
quite
sufficient
and
though
very
sensible
of
his
kind
thoughtfulness
i
said
that
if
he
liked
to
make
me
a
present
i
would
choose
something
useful
a
silk
dress
for
instance
but
that
would
not
be
a
present
he
said
when
you
want
a
dress
you
buy
it
i
should
like
to
offer
you
some
pretty
object
which
would
last
i
knew
that
he
liked
to
see
me
and
ladies
in
general
wearing
jewels
not
in
great
quantity
but
simply
as
a
touch
of
finish
to
the
toilette
when
i
was
young
he
would
have
liked
me
had
it
been
possible
to
dress
always
in
white
and
the
fashions
not
being
then
so
elaborate
as
they
have
become
it
was
easy
enough
in
and
in
the
country
to
indulge
his
taste
so
in
warm
days
i
often
wore
a
white
muslin
dress
quite
plain
relieved
only
by
a
colored
sash
if
the
sash
happened
to
be
green
he
liked
it
to
be
matched
by
a
set
of
crystal
beads
of
the
same
color
which
he
had
brought
me
from
switzerland
when
he
had
gone
there
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
when
the
ribbon
was
red
i
was
to
wear
corals
and
with
a
blue
one
at
last
he
remembered
that
i
had
admired
some
plain
bracelets
of
english
make
that
we
had
been
looking
at
together
not
far
from
the
national
gallery
and
said
he
would
be
glad
if
i
would
choose
one
of
them
i
had
however
taken
the
same
resolution
about
jewels
as
his
own
about
pictures
and
that
was
to
admire
what
was
beautiful
but
never
to
buy
because
it
was
beyond
our
means
the
resolution
once
taken
left
no
way
open
to
temptation
still
i
did
not
mean
to
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
accepting
his
proffered
present
only
i
did
not
want
it
to
be
expensive
and
since
i
had
a
sufficiency
of
jewels
would
he
give
me
a
pretty
casket
to
put
them
in
yes
he
readily
assented
and
when
i
opened
the
casket
of
fair
with
the
delicately
wrought
nickel
clasps
and
lock
i
found
a
folded
paper
laid
on
the
velvet
tray
and
having
opened
it
read
what
follows
i
need
not
say
with
what
emotions
here
in
this
empty
casket
instead
of
a
diamond
or
pearl
instead
of
a
gem
i
leave
but
a
little
rhyme
she
remembers
the
brooch
and
the
bracelet
i
gave
her
when
she
was
a
girl
deep
blue
from
beyond
the
sea
not
paler
from
lapse
of
time
she
will
put
them
here
in
the
casket
the
ultramarine
and
the
gold
and
if
such
a
thing
might
be
i
would
give
them
to
her
twice
over
once
in
my
youthful
hope
and
now
again
when
i
old
but
alike
in
youth
or
in
age
with
the
heart
and
the
soul
of
a
lover
this
note
is
entered
in
the
diary

roberts

had
heard
that
a
new
book
was
in
preparation
and
they
wrote
in
january
your
third
edition
of
and
etchers
is
really
a
magnificent
specimen
of
and
we
understand
two
hundred
copies
have
been
sold
in
america
at
all
events
whatever
the
number
sold
it
is
not
to
be
had
we
should
like
to
have
the
american
edition
of
the
arts
and
should
be
glad
to
receive
the
novel
when
it
is
ready
but
the
novel
had
been
put
aside
the
author
being
doubtful
if
it
equalled
marmorne
in
quality
the
whole
of
his
time
for
writing
was
devoted
to
the
graphic
arts
and
the
remainder
to
painting
from
nature
often
with
pickering
and
to
the
consideration
of
the
necessary
alterations
to
the
boat
in
view
of
a
summer
cruise
on
the
sa√¥ne
the
reading
of
italian
was
resumed
pretty
regularly
whilst
the
diary
was
kept
in
that
language
early
in
the
spring
seeley
wrote
i
am
afraid
it
is
indispensable
that
we
should
meet
in
paris
as
the
selection
of
engravings
for
reproduction
is
very
important
though
like
you
i
grudge
the
loss
of
time
but
the
book
is
an
important
one
and
we
must
do
our
very
best
to
make
it
a
success
it
was
then
decided
that
my
husband
should
go
to
paris
with
richard
and
they
started
on
may
stopped
a
day
at
sens
to
see
the
cathedral
again
and
to
call
upon
madame

had
become
a
widow

and
to
an

much
interested

with

and
notes
richard
astonishment
at
it
he
considered
it
himself
as
one
of
the
finest
of
existing

he
also
expresses
the
great
pleasure
he
derived
from
jacquemart
their
brilliancy
and
sureness
of
execution
the
four
following
days
having
been
very
busy
received
only
this
short
note
in

then
the

the
succeeding
entries
record
further
visits
to
the

and
biblioth√®que
but
on
the
return
journey
at
chagny
on
the
he
notes
that
he
has
received
sad
news
of
the
death
of
de
saint
victor
in
a
duel
with
asselin
it
was
only
too
true
and
had
happened
on
a
day
which
was
to
have
been
a
for
madame
de
saint
victor
whose
daughter
went
to
the
same
school
as
ours
had
invited
both
myself
and
mary
with
a
few
others
and
their
mothers
to
lunch
at
the
ch√¢teau
de
monjeu
of
which
her
husband
was
r√©gisseur
the
unfortunate
lady
did
not
know
what
had
passed
between
her
husband
and
a
gentleman
of
the
locality
who
was
trespassing
on
the
grounds
of
the
ch√¢teau
de
saint
victor
considered
himself
insulted
and
challenged
asselin
he
moreover
insisted
upon
choosing
the
sword
as
a
weapon
the
most
dangerous
of
all
in
a
serious
duel
and
on
the
morning
which
should
have
been
festive
and
mirthful
he
fell
dead
in
the
wood
near
his
home
killed
by
a
from
his
skilful
adversary
as
soon
as
he
was
back
home
hamerton
set
to
work
regularly
at
the
graphic
arts
in
the
diary
this
phrase
is
repeated
like
a
litany
worked
with
great
pleasure
at
my
book
the
arts
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
complaint
that
it
prevents
the
mind
from
being
happily
disposed
for
artistic
work
i
have
already
said
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
turn
from
one
kind
of
occupation
to
another
here
is
a
confirmation
of
this
fact
i
lost
the
whole
of
the
day
in
attempting
to
make
a
drawing
for
an
etching
was
not
in
the
mood
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
certain
warmth
and
interest
in
a
subject
which
i
have
lost
but
hope
to
recover
for
a
long
time
past
all
my
thoughts
have
turned
upon
my
literary
work
it
is
easy
for
readers
of
the
graphic
arts
to
realize
what
an
amount
of
knowledge
and
preparation
such
a
book
required
and
to
present
so
much
information
in
a
palatable
form
was
no
less
than
a
feat
still
the
author
took
great
delight
in
his
work
as
in
the
case
of
etching
and
etchers
he
was
encouraged
by
the
publisher
who
wrote
on
june
i
mean
to
take
a
pride
in
the
book
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
work
which
suited
him
sufficiently
important
to
allow
the
subjects
to
be
treated
at
length
when
necessary
and
worthy
of
the
infinite
care
and
thought
he
liked
to
bestow
upon
his
studies
in
this
case
wonderful
as
it
seems
he
had
himself
practised
all
the
arts
of
which
he
speaks
with
the
exception
of
fresco
as
to
the
other
branches
of
art
namely
sanguine
chalk
charcoal
water
monochrome
oil
monochrome
pastel
painting
in
oil
painting
in
etching
and
aquatint
and
mezzotint
lithography
he
had
more
or
less
tried
every
one
of
them
and
though
he
did
not
give
sufficient
practice
to
the
burin
to
acquire
real
skill
still
he
did
not
remain
satisfied
till
he
could
use
it
the
same
feeling
of
conscientiousness
led
him
to
become
acquainted
with
all
the
different
processes
of
reproduction
so
much
in
vogue
and
he
was
ever
anxious
to
learn
all
their
technical
details
it
was
hoped
that
the
graphic
arts
might
be
published
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
in
order
to
be
ready
the
author
put
aside
all
other
work
excepting
that
of
the
portfolio
but
he
longed
for
a
short
holiday
and
meant
to
take
it
on
the
sa√¥ne
he
went
to
chalon
to
a
and
explained
the
changes
to
be
made
in
the
morvandelle
set
the
men
to
work
and
returned
to
his
book
he
had
begun
to
suffer
from
insomnia
and
seeley
wrote
probably
you
are
right
in
saying
that
yachting
is
a
necessity
for
you
but
for
the
enjoyment
of
it
you
are
badly
placed
at
autun
you
must
look
after
that
cottage
at
cowes
which
i
suggested
some
time
ago
and
we
must
set
up
a
yacht
between
us
only
unluckily
i
am
always
seasick
in
a
breeze
certainly
the
situation
of
autun
was
not
favorable
to
yachting
the
streams
about
it
being
only
fit
for
canoeing
but
the
broad
sa√¥ne
was
not
far
off
and
as
chalon
was
my
husband
headquarters
when
cruising
he
was
not
disinclined
to
the
short
journey
which
afforded
an
opportunity
for
visiting
my
mother
and
my
brother
who
lived
there
my
husband
had
thought
that
a
river
voyage
would
be
charming
with
stevenson
as
a
companion
and
that
they
might
perhaps
produce
a
work
in
collaboration
so
he
had
made
the
proposal
and
here
is
part
of
the
answer
rinnaud
cottage
pitlochry
perthshire
my
dear
hammerton
there
goes
the
second
m
it
is
a
certainty
thank
you
for
your
prompt
and
kind
answer
little
as
i
deserved
it
though
i
hope
to
show
you
i
was
less
undeserving
than
i
seemed
but
just
might
i
delete
two
words
in
your
testimonial
the
two
words
were
unfortunately
winged
by
chance
against
my
weakest
spot
and
would
go
far
to
damn
me
it
was
not
my
bliss
that
i
was
interested
in
when
i
was
married
it
was
a
sort
of
marriage
and
if
i
am
where
i
am
it
is
thanks
to
the
care
of
that
lady
who
married
me
when
i
was
a
mere
complication
of
cough
and
bones
much
fitter
for
an
emblem
of
mortality
than
a
bridegroom
i
had
a
fair
experience
of
that
kind
of
illness
when
all
the
women
god
bless
them
i
turn
round
upon
the
streets
and
look
after
you
with
a
look
that
is
only
too
kind
not
to
be
cruel
i
have
had
nearly
two
years
of
more
or
less
prostration
i
have
done
no
work
whatever
since
the
february
before
last
until
quite
of
late
to
be
precise
until
the
beginning
of
the
last
month
exactly
two
essays
all
last
winter
i
was
at
davos
and
indeed
i
am
home
here
just
now
against
the
orders
and
must
soon
be
back
again
to
that
unkindly
haunt
the
mountains
visitant
there
goes
no
angel
there
but
the
angel
of
death
the
deaths
of
last
winter
are
still
sore
spots
to
me
so
you
see
i
am
not
very
likely
to
go
on
a
expedition
at
least
the
truth
is
i
am
scarce
justified
in
standing
for
the
chair
though
i
hope
you
will
not
mention
this
and
yet
my
health
is
one
of
my
reasons
for
the
class
is
in
summer
i
hope
this
statement
of
my
case
will
make
my
long
neglect
appear
less
unkind
it
was
certainly
not
because
i
ever
forgot
you
or
your
unwonted
kindness
and
it
was
not
because
i
was
in
any
sense
rioting
in
pleasures
i
am
glad
to
hear
the
catamaran
is
on
her
legs
again
you
have
my
warmest
wishes
for
a
good
cruise
down
the
sa√¥ne
and
yet
there
comes
some
envy
to
that
wish
for
when
shall
i
go
cruising
here
a
sheer
hulk
alas
lies
but
i
will
continue
to
hope
for
a
better
time
canoes
that
will
sail
better
to
the
wind
and
a
river
grander
than
the
sa√¥ne
i
heard
by
the
way
in
a
letter
of
counsel
from
a
one
reason
of
my
town
absurdity
about
the
chair
of
art
i
fear
it
is
characteristic
of
her
manners
it
was
because
you
did
not
call
upon
the
electors
will
you
remember
me
to
hamerton
and
your
son
and
believe
me
etc
in
september
we
had
the
pleasure
of
a
visit
from
miss
and
the
acquaintance
ripened
into
friendship
having
brought
the
graphic
arts
satisfactorily
forward
my
husband
thought
that
he
might
indulge
in
the
holiday
on
the
sa√¥ne
he
expected
to
find
everything
ready
at
chalon
and
to
have
only
to
superintend
the
putting
together
of
the
sections
of
the
boat
he
was
however
sorely
disappointed
on
finding
that
nothing
had
been
done
and
that
he
must
spend
several
days
in
pushing
the
workmen
on
instead
of
sailing
pleasantly
on
the
river
after
a
week
of
worry
and
irritation
the
boat
was
launched
and
the
two
boys
having
joined
their
father
on
board
they
went
together
as
far
as
tournus
after
spending
the
first
night
at
port
where
they
had
found
a
nice
little
inn
with
simple
but
good
accommodation
in
the
afternoon
stephen
went
back
to
autun
to
fetch
his
things
for
he
was
obliged
to
be
at
his
post
on
the
first
of
october
richard
proceeded
with
his
father
down
the
sa√¥ne
to
m√¢con
the
diary
says
a
beautiful
voyage
it
was
the
loveliest
weather
favorable
wind
strong
delightful
play
of
light
and
color
on
water
i
had
not
enjoyed
such
boating
since
i
left
loch
awe
there
are
these
notes
in
the
diary
corrected
the
last
proof
of
the
arts
and
sent
it
off
with
a
new
finish
as
the
other
seemed
too
abrupt
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
over
the
finish
writing
it
twice
worked
all
day
as
hard
as
possible
at
index
to
arts
and
got
it
finished
at
midnight
he
was
in
time
but
seeley
wrote
now
goupil
delay
about
the
illustrations
threatens
to
become
most
serious
we
have
now
orders
for
copies
large
and
small
so
we
have
already
surpassed
the
sale
of
and
etchers
third
edition
alas
there
was
a
very
distressing
item
of
news
in
the
letter
dated
december
the
enclosed
letter
from
goupil
is
a
complete
upset
it
seems
that
the
printing
of
the
louvre
drawings
footnote
two
drawings
by
zucchero
and
watteau
the
latter
was
in
black
red
and
white
chalk
the
reproduction
was
printed
from
one
plate
the
different
colored
inks
being
rubbed
in
by
the
printer
only
about
ten
prints
could
be
taken
in
a
day
will
take
five
or
six
months
we
must
decide
at
once
what
to
do
this
is
one
plan
if
we
can
get
all
the
other
illustrations
ready
then
to
publish
as
soon
as
we
can
putting
these
three
plates
in
the
large
paper
copies
only
and
in
the
others
a
slip
of
paper
explaining
how
tedious
the
printing
is
and
promising
that
these
illustrations
shall
be
delivered
in
the
spring
to
any
purchaser
who
produces
the
slip
this
is
one
plan
if
you
prefer
it
please
telegraph
the
other
plan
is
to
postpone
the
publication
and
bring
out
the
complete
book
in
the
spring
if
you
prefer
this
please
telegraph
i
leave
the
matter
entirely
in
your
hands
pray
decide
as
you
judge
best
this
delay
was
most
provoking
after
the
hard
work
the
author
had
given
to
the
book
to
have
it
out
in
good
time
and
also
because
the
orders
were
increasing
they
had
now
reached
copies
for
the
large
edition
and
of
the
small
one
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
the
publication
must
be
postponed
rather
than
give
an
imperfect
book
to
the
public
both
author
and
publisher
agreed
in
that
decision
on
december
hamerton
received
the
following
letter
warwick
crescent
dear
hamerton
you
will
do
me
an
honor
indeed
by
the
dedication
you
propose
and
my
own
little
worthiness
to
receive
it
becomes
of
secondary
importance
when
taken
with
the
exceeding
importance
of
the
truth
you
insist
upon
in
connection
with
it
a
truth
always
plain
to
me
however
moderately
i
may
have
been
able
to
illustrate
its
value
thank
you
very
much
you
will
add
to
my
obligation
by
the
visit
you
so
kindly
promise
i
return
you
the
best
of
christmas
wishes
and
am
ever
dear
hamerton
yours
most
truly
robert
browning
i
transcribe
the
dedication
to
explain
browning
letter
to
robert
browning
i
wish
to
dedicate
this
book
to
you
as
the
representative
of
a
class
which
ought
to
be
more
numerous
the
class
of
persons
who
take
a
lively
interest
in
arts
which
are
not
specially
their
own
no
one
who
had
not
carefully
observed
the
narrowing
of
men
minds
by
specialities
could
believe
to
what
a
degree
it
goes
instead
of
being
open
as
yours
has
always
been
to
the
influences
of
literature
in
the
largest
sense
as
well
as
to
the
influences
of
the
graphic
arts
and
music
the
specialized
mind
shuts
itself
up
in
its
own
pursuit
so
exclusively
that
it
does
not
even
know
what
is
nearest
to
its
own
closed
doors
we
meet
with
scholars
who
take
no
more
account
of
the
graphic
arts
than
if
they
did
not
exist
and
with
painters
who
never
read
but
what
is
still
more
surprising
is
the
complete
indifference
with
which
an
art
can
be
regarded
by
men
who
know
and
practise
another
not
widely
removed
from
it
one
may
be
a
painter
and
yet
know
nothing
whatever
about
any
kind
of
engraving
one
may
be
a
skilled
engraver
and
yet
work
in
lifelong
misunderstanding
of
the
rapid
arts
if
the
specialists
who
devote
themselves
to
a
single
study
had
more
of
your
interest
in
the
work
of
others
they
might
find
as
you
have
done
that
the
quality
which
may
be
called
is
far
from
being
an
impediment
to
success
even
in
the
highest
and
most
arduous
of
artistic
and
intellectual
pursuits
hamerton
was
so
adverse
to
puffing
of
any
kind
and
to
noise
being
made
about
his
name
that
he
neglected
the
most
honest
means
of
having
it
brought
forward
to
public
notice
for
instance
he
had
been
asked
in
november
for
notes
on
his
life
for
a
book
to
be
entitled
the
victorian
era
of
english
literature
and
had
forgotten
all
about
it
he
had
to
be
reminded
in
that
he
had
promised
to
send
the
notes
i
suppose
that
the
following
letter
from
stevenson
must
have
been
received
about
this
time
it
is
almost
impossible
to
ascertain
as
like
the
others
it
bears
no
date

my
dear
hamerton
my
conscience
has
long
been
smiting
me
till
it
became
nearly
chronic
my
excuses
however
are
many
and
not
pleasant
almost
immediately
after
i
last
wrote
to
you
i
had
a
hemorreage
i
ca
spell
it
was
badly
treated
by
a
doctor
in
the
country
and
have
been
a
long
while
picking
up
still
in
fact
have
much
to
desire
on
that
side
next
as
soon
as
i
got
here
my
wife
took
ill
she
is
i
fear
seriously
so
and
this
combination
of
two
invalids
very
much
depresses
both
i
have
a
volume
of
republished
essays
coming
out
with
chatto
and
windus
i
wish
they
would
come
that
my
wife
might
have
the
reviews
to
divert
her
otherwise
my
news
is
nil
i
am
up
here
in
a
little
chalet
on
the
borders
of
a
overlooking
a
great
part
of
the
davos
thai
a
beautiful
scene
at
night
with
the
moon
upon
the
snowy
mountains
and
the
lights
warmly
shining
in
the
village
j
symonds
is
next
door
to
me
just
at
the
foot
of
my
hill
difficulty
this
you
will
please
regard
as
the
house
beautiful
and
his
society
is
my
great
did
you
see
i
had
joined
the
band
of
the
rejected
one
of
us
said
my
at
the
bar
i
was
blamed
by
a
common
friend
for
asking
you
to
give
me
a
testimonial
in
the
circumstances
he
thought
it
was
indelicate
lest
by
some
calamity
you
should
ever
have
felt
the
same
way
i
must
say
in
two
words
how
the
matter
appeared
to
me
that
silly
story
of
the
election
altered
in
no
tittle
the
value
of
your
testimony
so
much
for
that
on
the
other
hand
it
led
me
to
take
a
quite
particular
pleasure
in
asking
you
to
give
it
and
so
much
for
the
other
i
trust
even
if
you
can
not
share
it
you
will
understand
my
view
i
am
in
treaty
with
bentley
for
a
life
of
hazlitt
i
hope
it
will
not
fall
through
as
i
love
the
subject
and
appear
to
have
found
a
publisher
who
loves
it
also
that
i
think
makes
things
more
pleasant
you
know
i
am
a
fervent
hazlittite
i
mean
regarding
him
as
english
writer
who
has
had
the
scantiest
justice
besides
which
i
am
anxious
to
write
biography
really
if
i
understand
myself
in
quest
of
profit
i
think
it
must
be
good
to
live
with
another
man
from
birth
to
death
you
have
tried
it
and
know
how
has
the
cruising
gone
pray
remember
me
to
hamerton
and
your
son
and
believe
me
yours
very
sincerely

louis
stevenson
throughout
this
year
the
diary
was
kept
in
italian
and
the
reading
of
italian
books
was
pretty
regularly
kept
up
among
them
were
olanda
petrarch
and
ariosto
he
soon
abandoned
petrarch
whom
he
did
not
value
much
here
is
the
reason
i
prefer
the
clear
movement
of
ariosto
to
all
the
conceits
of
the
human
intercourse
was
begun
and
to
save
time
two
copies
were
written
simultaneously
one
for
england
and
the
other
for
america
by
inserting
a
sheet
of
black
copying
paper
between
two
sheets
of
thin
field
and
tuer
paper
and
writing
with
a
hard
lead
pencil
and
sufficient
pressure
to
obtain
a
duplicate
on
the
page
placed
underneath
roberts
brothers
were
very
desirous
of
seeing
this
new
work
and
had
written
we
should
like
to
make
intercourse
a
companion
volume
to
the
life
and
the
title
is
so
suggestive
of
something
good
that
we
hope
you
will
hasten
the
good
time
of
its
appearance
the
publication
of
the
graphic
arts
had
been
fixed
for
march
but
a
copy
having
been
got
ready
at
the
end
of
january
it
was
sent
as
a
compliment
to
sagar
of
the
burnley
mechanics
institution
and
seeley
said
the
burnley
people
are
delighted
at
having
had
the
first
sight
of
the
arts
sagar
writes
that
from
what
he
saw
of
it
he
has
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
is
the
best
book
you
have
written
and
does
great
credit
to
everybody
concerned
in
its
production
the
book
was
highly
appreciated
by
those
competent
to
judge
and
understand
the
subjects
haden
wrote
about
it
a
letter
of
fourteen
pages
though
he
calls
it
himself
an
unconscionably
long
letter
it
is
most
interesting
throughout
but
i
only
quote
a
few
passages
from
it
i
have
been
reading
the
arts
with
great
interest
it
is
or
rather
must
have
been
a
formidable
undertaking
i
like
your
chapter
on
and
aesthetic
drawing
your
insistence
on
keeping
the
two
things
separate
and
claiming
for
each
its
value
is
a
great
lesson
read
too
just
at
the
right
time
and
in
your
for
artistic
pleasure
the
great
lesson
there
is
that
true
artistic
pleasure
can
only
be
excited
in
others
by
the
artist
that
what
he
is
about
though
he
does
not
express
it
did
you
ever
see
a
drawing
or
an
etching
by
victor
hugo
hugo
is
a
poet
and
affects
to
be
an
artist
but
his
knowledge
of
what
is
or
should
be
in
every
picture
is
so
lamentably
absent
that
his
poetry
sought
to
be
imparted
in
that
shape
goes
for
nothing
in
and
wrong
in
drawing
which
is
excellently
written
the
concluding
paragraph
is
admirable
the
chapter
on
and
is
charmingly
written
easy
and
refined
in
diction
and
set
down
then
came
this
letter
from
browning
warwick
crescent
dear
hamerton
i
thought
your
dedication
a
great
honor
to
me
and
should
have
counted
it
such
had
it
simply
prefaced
a
pamphlet
to
connect
it
with
this
magnificent
book
is
indeed
engraving
my
name
on
a
jewel
instead
of
stone
or
even
marble
your
sumptuous
present
reached
me
two
days
ago
and
will
be
consigned
to
library
when
the
best
jewel
i
boast
of
is
disposed
of
on
my
among
articles
proper
to
the
place
no
indeed
it
shall
be
encased
as
a
jewel
should
on
a
desk
for
all
to
see
how
the
author
has
chosen
to
illustrate
the
and
of
the
author
admirer
and
dares
he
add
friend
robert
browning
alfred
hunt
also
wrote
i
can
see
that
the
plan
of
the
book
is
admirable
i
often
want
to
know
something
about
art
processes
which
i
do
practise
myself
and
which
i
might
be
stimulated
into
trying
if
i
was
only
younger
the
sale
of
the
book
was
rapid
and
before
six
weeks
had
elapsed
so
few
copies
remained
that
the
prices
were
raised
to
fifteen
guineas
for
the
large
edition
and
to
seven
and
a
half
guineas
for
the
small
one
but
the
author
had
overworked
himself
and
hurry
had
brought
back
the
old
enemy
insomnia
seeley
who
had
lately
suffered
from
lumbago
wrote
sleeplessness
is
a
far
worse
thing
than
lumbago
you
are
right
in
taking
it
seriously
i
have
little
doubt
however
that
by
avoiding
overwork
and
especially
hurried
work
and
getting
plenty
of
exercise
you
will
overcome
the
tendency
if
you
ever
do
another
big
book
we
must
take
two
or
three
years
for
it
and
have
no
sort
of
hurry
i
once
thought
of
the
painters
as
a
good
subject
for
a
big
book
in
a
subsequent
letter
seeley
gives
a
great
deal
of
thoughtful
consideration
to
what
might
suit
his
friend
requirements
if
painting
is
a
subject
that
you
would
thoroughly
like
to
take
up
please
tell
me
what
travelling
you
would
consider
needful
and
as
far
as
expense
goes
i
will
try
to
meet
you
perhaps
for
one
thing
we
might
go
to
italy
together
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
dragged
about
in
a
chain
i
thought
of
the
rh√¥ne
book
again
as
likely
to
suit
your
present
state
of
health
in
the
current
year
however
it
was
impossible
to
undertake
the
voyage
because
human
intercourse
was
to
be
the
important
work
as
usual
with
a
new
book
the
author
had
had
a
struggle
at
the
beginning
he
attributed
the
difficulty
to
the
want
of
subdivisions
in
the
chapters
and
when
he
had
adopted
a
more
elastic
system
than
is
usual
in
a
treatise
the
obstacle
disappeared
he
has
himself
explained
this
more
in
detail
to
his
readers
in
the
preface
of
the
book
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
long
struggle
had
increased
the
tendency
to
sleeplessness
and
a
little
cruise
on
the
sa√¥ne
was
thought
to
be
the
best
remedy
so
he
left
for
m√¢con
at
the
beginning
of
april
and
after
putting
the
several
parts
of
the
boat
together
and
getting
provisions
on
board
he
started
with
stephen
on
a
voyage
down
the
sa√¥ne
on
their
way
they
could
see
with
a
telescope
all
the
details
of
mont
blanc
at
port
they
picked
up
a
friend
and
after
a
good
little
repast
with
a
good
friday
a
few
sketches
were
made
at
thoissey
and
beauregard
the
change
and
exercise
in
the
open
air
did
my
husband
a
great
deal
of
good
and
he
had
regained
sleep
when
he
returned
home
there
being
still
a
good
deal
of
leakage
in
the
morvandelle
though
a
thick
kind
of
flannel
had
been
pressed
into
the
interstices
it
was
decided
to
use
the
wooden
parts
to
make
two
small
boats
for
the
pond
one
for
stephen
and
the
other
for
richard
the
old
ones
being
rotten
there
was
much
pleasurable
planning
for
my
husband
in
the
scheme
and
also
some
manual
work
for
rainy
weather
he
was
exceedingly
careful
and
handy
in
doing
joiner
work
and
every
one
in
the
house
applied
to
him
for
delicate
repairs
and
when
he
had
time
they
were
done
to
perfection
only
he
seldom
had
time
and
it
was
a
standing
joke
that
he
must
have
a
private
museum
somewhere
to
which
the
objects
confided
to
him
found
their
way
in
reality
he
had
to
do
a
good
deal
of
manual
labor
of
different
kinds
on
account
of
our
country
life
which
placed
us
at
an
inconvenient
distance
from
workmen
for
instance
he
always
framed
his
etchings
and
engravings
himself
at
one
time
he
even
undertook
to
all
the
frames
which
the
flies
so
rapidly
spoilt
in
the
country
he
had
also
to
make
numerous
and
boxes
for
the
sending
of
plates
pictures
and
books
he
invented
lots
of
contrivances
for
the
arrangement
of
his
colors
brushes
portfolios
etc
he
made
different
portable
easels
with
folding
stools
corresponding
to
their
size
for
working
from
nature
desks
for
large
books
such
as
dictionaries
to
be
placed
by
the
side
of
his
when
he
was
reading
others
for
etchings
and
engravings
so
that
they
might
be
examined
without
fear
of
any
object
coming
in
contact
with
them
so
sensitive
was
he
to
the
way
in
which
works
of
art
were
handled
that
he
allowed
no
one
to
touch
his
prints
or
illustrated
books
he
was
always
in
dread
about
their
margins
being
creased
or
crumpled
and
to
avoid
this
possibility
he
used
to
show
them
himself
a
told
me
that
my
husband
had
said
to
him
once
i
would
not
trust
you
to
handle
one
of
your
own
etchings
seeley
had
suggested
that
some
illustrated
articles
about
autun
might
interest
the
readers
of
the
portfolio
on
account
of
the
roman
and
mediaeval
remains
the
remarkable
cathedral
and
the
picturesque
character
of
the
surrounding
country
he
thought
that
as
a
title
an
old
burgundian
city
would
do
in
a
former
letter
he
had
expressed
a
wish
that
his
editor
should
come
to
england
if
possible
every
year
in
the
spring
instead
of
the
autumn
when
it
was
too
late
to
discuss
arrangements
for
the
portfolio
for
the
ensuing
year
hamerton
admitted
that
it
would
be
desirable
no
doubt
but
he
could
not
afford
it
the
expenses
of
our
last
stay
had
been
a
warning
though
we
had
lived
as
simply
as
possible
to
these
considerations
seeley
had
answered
i
am
sorry
you
do
not
feel
more
happy
about
your
future
work
what
seems
to
be
wanting
is
some
public
post
in
which
you
would
be
paid
for
studying
but
he
had
had
more
than
enough
of
such
schemes
after
his
attempt
at
edinburgh
and
it
was
the
only
one
he
was
ever
induced
to
make
he
began
at
once
the
which
were
to
illustrate
the
articles
on
autun
and
he
liked
his
work
exceedingly

from

virard
pierre
de

is√®rs
dear
hamerton
when
i
got
a
month
ago
your
very
pleasant
letter
i
felt
that
full
as
it
was
of
influences
from
autun
the
sa√¥ne
between
chalon
and
lyons
speeded
by
square
feet
of
canvas
my
little
word
of
thanks
in
reply
would
never
get
well
under
weigh
from
the
banks
of
our
sluggish
canal
so
reserved
launching
it
till
i
should
reach
this
point
of
vantage
and
now
forth
with
it
that
wherever
it
may
find
you
i
may
assure
your
kindness
that
it
would
indeed
have
gratified
me
to
see
you
had
circumstances
enabled
you
to
come
my
way
and
that
the
amends
you
promise
for
failing
to
do
so
will
be
duly
counted
upon
whether
that
will
happen
at
warwick
crescent
is
unlikely
rather
than
merely
uncertain
since
the
bill
which
is
to
abolish
my
house
among
many
more
notable
erections
has
the
lords
a
fortnight
ago
and
i
must
look
about
for
another
lodging
much
against
my
will
i
dropped
into
it
with
all
the
indifference
possible
some
years
ago
meaning
to
slip
out
again
soon
as
this
happened
and
that
happened
and
they
all
did
happen
and
yet
found
me
with
a
sufficient
reason
for
staying
longer
till
only
last
year
while
abroad
the
extraordinary
thought
occurred
need
of
removing
at
all
to
which
was
no
answer
so
i
took
certain
steps
toward
permanent
comfort
which
never
before
seemed
worth
taking
and
on
my
return
was
saluted
by
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
a
railway
company
wanted
my
forecourt
and
garden
and
wished
to
know
if
i
objected
i
who
a
month
or
two
before
had
painted
the
house
and
improved
the
garden
go
i
must
but
i
shall
endeavor
to
go
somewhere
near
and
your
visit
if
you
pay
me
one
will
begin
the
good
associations
with
the
place
and
place
you
may
be
acquainted
with
it
not
unlikely
it
is
a
hamlet
on
a
hilltop
surrounded
by
mountains
covered
with
fir
being
the
ancient
cartusia
whence
our
neighbors
the
monks
took
their
name
the
great
chartreuse
lies
close
by
an
hour
walk
perhaps
this
hamlet
is
in
their
district
desert
as
they
call
it
their
walks
are
confined
to
it
and
you
meet
on
a
certain
day
a
procession
of
shavelings
absolved
from
their
vow
of
silence
and
chattering
like
magpies
while
vigorously
engaged
in
we
have
not
a
single
shop
in
the
whole
handful
of
houses
excepting
the
et
timbres
establishment
where
jalap
and
lollipops
are
sold
likewise
and
one
hovel
the
owner
of
which
calls
himself
on
its
outside
yet
there
is
this
and
an
auberge
or
two
serving
to
house
travellers
who
are
dismissed
from
the
convent
at
times
inconvenient
for
reaching
grenoble
or
so
i
suppose
the
beauty
and
quiet
of
the
scenery
the
purity
of
the
air
the
variety
of
the
these
are
incomparable
in
our
eyes
those
of
my
sister
and
myself
and
make
all
roughnesses
smooth
we
spent
five
weeks
here
last
season
will
do
the
like
now
and
then
are
bound
for
ischia
where
a
friend
entertains
us
for
a
month
in
a
seaside
villa
he
inhabits
afterwards
to
london
with
what
appetite
we
may
though
london
has
its
abundant
worth
too
utterly
peaceful
as
this
country
appears
and
you
may
walk
in
its
main
roads
for
hours
without
meeting
any
one
but
a
herdsman
or
i
shall
tell
you
a
little
experience
i
have
had
of
its
possibilities
on
the
last
day
of
our
sojourn
last
year
we
took
a
final
look
at
and
leave
of
a
valley
a
few
miles
off
and
as
i
stood
thinking
of
the
utter
of
the
little
spot
and
its
surroundings
the
odd
fancy
entered
my
head
you
discovered
a
corpse
in
this
solitude
would
you
think
it
your
duty
to
go
and
apprise
the
authorities
incurring
all
the
risks
and
certain
hindrance
to
morrow
departure
which
such
an
act
entails
in
france
or
would
you
simply
hold
your
tongue
and
i
concluded
ought
to
run
those
risks
well
that
night
a
man
was
found
murdered
just
there
where
i
had
been
looking
down
and
the
owner
of
the
field
was
at
once
arrested
and
shut
up
in
the
of
the
village
of
pierre
close
by
the
victim
was
an
italian
mason
had
received
seven
mortal
wounds
and
lay
in
a
with
a
sack
containing
potatoes
had
probably
been
caught
stealing
these
by
the
owner
who
had
killed
him
so
the
owner
was
taken
into
custody
we
heard
this
and
were
inconvenienced
enough
by
it
next
day
for
our
journey
was
delayed
by
the
judge
from
grenoble
possessing
himself
of
the
mule
which
was
to
carry
our
luggage
in
order
to
report
on
the
spot
but
we
got
away
at
last
on
returning
last
week
i
inquired
about
the
result
accused
man
who
was
plainly
innocent
being
altogether
by
the
charge
coming
upon
him
just
in
his
distress
at
losing
a
daughter
a
fortnight
before
had
taken
advantage
of
the
negligence
of
the
gendarmes
to
throw
himself
from
the
window
he
survived
three
hours
protesting
his
innocence
to
the
last
which
was
confirmed
by
good
evidence
the
likelihood
being
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
by
the
companions
at
a
little
distance
and
the
body
carried
thro
the
woods
and
laid
there
to
divert
suspicions
well
might
my
genius
warn
me
of
the
danger
of
being
a
victim
neighbor
but
how
i
have
victimized
if
you
have
borne
with
me
forgive
and
believe
me
ever
yours
truly
robert
browning
seeley
had
thought
that
a
series
of
articles
on
paris
might
be
suitable
for
the
portfolio
if
they
were
written
by
the
editor
who
knew
the
beautiful
city
so
well
and
accordingly
my
husband
had
decided
to
go
there
for
a
month
in
order
to
take
notes
and
to
choose
subjects
for
the
illustrations
he
never
could
have
been
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
remaining
a
month
in
paris
alone
and
i
bethought
myself
of
a
plan
which
seemed
both
economical
and
pleasant
and
which
he
readily
adopted
it
was
to
take
mary
with
us
and
to
rent
a
small
apartment
in
our
quiet
h√¥tel
de
la
muette
having
our
meals
prepared
in
our
private
kitchen
for
each
apartment
was
complete
and
the
cleaning
done
with
the
help
of
a
de
it
would
be
a
sort
of
on
a
very
small
scale
the
apartments
were
like
english
lodgings
without
attendance
moreover
no
one
belonging
to
the
hotel
not
even
a
servant
had
a
right
to
enter
the
apartments
they
were
entirely
private
one
might
order
the
most
costly
repasts
from
the
luxurious
restaurants
close
at
hand
or
keep
a
or
live
on
like
an
anchorite
just
as
one
pleased
without
anybody
noticing
it
this
liberty
was
exactly
what
my
husband
liked
we
left
home
on
october
with
richard
who
was
to
continue
his
artistic
studies
in
england
now
and
mary
whom
her
father
wanted
to
become
acquainted
with
the
different
museums
beautiful
buildings
and
treasures
of
art
under
his
direction
for
which
there
could
have
been
no
better
opportunity
we
all
looked
forward
to
this
change
as
to
a
de
the
young
people
especially
and
on
our
arrival
in
paris
mas
and
his
wife
received
us
with
great
cordiality
they
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
ordinary
type
of
and
welcomed
their
with
a
simple
hearty
friendliness
such
as
servants
who
had
been
all
their
lives
in
a
family
might
show
to
their
masters
which
pleased
my
husband
much
they
showed
us
with
visible
satisfaction
our
little
apartment
saying
that
it
had
been
reserved
for
us
on
account
of
mademoiselle
because
her
room
would
be
just
close
to
her
mamma
and
the
door
leading
from
one
to
the
other
might
be
left
open
at
night
we
were
told
that
the
kitchen
was
particularly
nice
because
monsieur
paul
baudry
un
artiste
aussi
had
fitted
it
up
√†
neuf
for
the
three
months
he
had
been
spending
in
our
present
apartment
early
in
the
morning
i
went
out
to
order
provisions
groceries
fuel
wine
for
the
month
we
were
to
remain
at
the
hotel
we
had
afterwards
an
excellent
and
cheerful
prepared
in
our
own
kitchen
my
husband
was
amused
by
the
contrivances
of
what
he
called
the
doll
house
and
said
he
did
not
mind
spending
a
month
in
that
way
in
the
afternoon
we
went
with
the
children
to
see
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
notre
dame
and
la
cour
de
cassation
in
each
of
these
buildings
my
husband
gave
us
a
short
explanatory
lesson
in
architecture
the
second
day
he
had
already
made
rules
for
the
division
of
his
time
according
to
which
the
mornings
would
be
reserved
for
writing
and
correspondence
d√©jeuner
was
to
be
ready
at
eleven
so
as
to
leave
the
afternoon
free
for
the
work
in
paris
as
on
the
previous
day
we
were
breakfasting
together
talking
of
richard
prospects
in
london
when
there
came
a
telegram
saying
that
our
dear
aunt
susan
thought
herself
to
be
sinking
and
desired
to
see
us
it
was
a
sudden
and
a
painful
blow
my
husband
had
not
a
moment
of
hesitation
about
what
he
would
do
he
told
us
to
pack
up
immediately
whilst
he
went
to
look
at
the
and
find
the
first
slow
for
england
richard
and
mary
were
to
go
with
us
it
would
be
a
last
satisfaction
for
their
aunt
if
we
arrived
in
time
i
was
full
of
apprehension
for
my
husband
but
of
course
refrained
from
mentioning
my
fears
there
was
no
slow
train
after
four
so
we
had
to
start
when
it
was
still
daylight
but
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
till
darkness
rendered
invisible
the
objects
we
passed
on
our
way
he
bore
the
journey
very
well
on
the
whole
and
on
reaching
calais
we
went
on
board
the
steamer
immediately
it
was
midnight
the
sea
was
splendidly
phosphorescent
and
richard
and
mary
took
great
delight
in
throwing
things
into
it
to
see
the
sparkles
flash
about
i
had
no
fear
so
long
as
we
remained
on
the
water
for
gilbert
always
enjoyed
it
whatever
the
weather
might
be
and
felt
utterly
free
from
nervousness
arrived
at
dover
at
four
in
the
morning
we
went
to
bed
for
a
little
rest
and
after
breakfast
went
out
for
a
walk
on
the
seashore
under
the
cliffs
richard
had
never
seen
the
sea
before
and
he
received
a
profound
impression
from
it
the
wind
was
high
and
the
big
green
crested
waves
came
dashing
their
foam
on
to
the
very
rocks
at
our
feet
the
alternate
effects
of
sunshine
and
masses
of
clouds
violently
driven
and
torn
by
the
squalls
were
magnificent
and
richard
more
than
ever
was
fired
with
the
wish
to
become
a
painter
his
sister
very
sensitive
to
natural
beauty
shared
his
enthusiasm
the
train
for
london
started
at
three
and
on
arriving
at
charing
cross
we
found
a
more
reassuring
telegram
stating
that
our
aunt
was
somewhat
better
thus
cheered
by
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
gilbert
was
able
to
eat
his
supper
with
us
before
going
to
bed
i
was
greatly
alarmed
by
his
decision
to
start
early
in
the
morning
and
to
travel
throughout
the
day
but
having
made
such
a
sacrifice
of
money
in
abandoning
our
apartment
and
provisions
and
in
taking
the
children
with
us
in
the
hope
of
giving
a
last
satisfaction
to
his
aunt
i
understood
that
he
would
on
no
account
run
the
risk
of
arriving
too
late
it
proved
a
most
painful
day
to
us
all
very
soon
he
gave
signs
of
distress
and
nervousness
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
hide
them
but
this
time
he
would
not
leave
the
train
though
i
besought
him
to
do
so
we
had
some
provisions
in
our
bags
but
weak
as
he
felt
he
could
not
swallow
a
morsel
of
anything
he
could
not
even
drink
still
at
one
time
he
thought
that
a
little
brandy
might
do
him
good
unfortunately
we
had
not
any
with
us
and
it
being
sunday
all
the
were
closed
on
the
line
he
strove
desperately
against
the
growing
cerebral
excitement
now
by
lying
down
at
full
length
on
the
cushions
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
his
eyes
closed
most
mercifully
we
were
alone
in
our
compartment
now
by
stamping
his
feet
in
the
narrow
space
and
rubbing
his
hands
vigorously
to
bring
back
circulation
in
these
alternate
fits
of
excitement
and
prostration
we
reached
doncaster
at
five
luckily
there
was
a
stoppage
of
about
forty
minutes
before
we
could
proceed
to
featherstone
and
we
turned
it
to
the
best
advantage
by
leaving
the
railway
station
and
going
in
search
of
a
quiet
hotel
where
we
ordered
something
to
eat
darkness
had
now
set
in
we
had
had
a
little
walk
out
of
sight
of
the
railway
in
the
open
air
and
there
seemed
to
be
not
a
soul
besides
ourselves
and
the
landlord
in
the
hotel
so
that
by
the
time
our
dinner
made
its
appearance
my
husband
had
so
far
recovered
that
he
was
able
to
take
both
food
and
drink
which
did
him
much
good
we
arrived
at
featherstone
station
after
ten
and
as
the
time
of
our
arrival
had
been
uncertain
there
was
nobody
to
meet
us
we
left
our
luggage
and
only
taking
our
handbags
we
set
off
for
the
vicarage
on
foot
in
the
dark
and
in
a
deluge
of
rain
at
eleven
we
were
all
standing
by
the
bed
of
our
dear
aunt
who
knew
us
perfectly
in
spite
of
her
weak
state
and
whose
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
richard
and
mary
was
as
great
as
unhoped
for
the
diary
says
our
poor
aunt
recognized
us
but
it
is
only
too
plain
that
she
can
not
live
more
than
three
or
four
days
the
doctor
whom
we
saw
on
the
following
morning
said
that
miss
hamerton
was
dying
of
no
disease
it
was
merely
the
breaking
up
of
the
constitution
she
was
kept
up
artificially
by
medicine
and
stimulants
very
frequently
administered
for
which
she
had
neither
taste
nor
desire
now
she
said
to
the
doctor
i
have
been
very
submissive
because
i
wanted
to
retain
my
flickering
life
until
i
should
see
my
nephew
and
his
family
this
great
happiness
has
been
granted
to
me
and
now
i
only
desire
to
go
to
my
final
rest
after
this
the
doctor
prescription
was
to
give
her
only
what
she
might
ask
for
we
remained
at
her
bedside
throughout
the
day
with
the
exception
of
a
visit
to
the
old
church
now
restored
with
care
and
taste
to
my
husband
satisfaction
we
watched
our
aunt
part
of
the
night
and
she
spoke
very
often
with
her
usual
clearness
of
mind
towards
three
in
the
morning
our
cousins
emma
and
annie
came
to
relieve
us
on
the
morrow
there
was
a
change
for
the
worse
with
greater
weakness
and
we
determined
my
husband
and
myself
to
watch
all
night
aunt
susan
concerned
herself
about
our
comfort
to
the
last
she
reminded
her
nephew
to
keep
up
a
good
fire
that
i
might
not
get
cold
she
insisted
upon
my
making
some
tea
for
myself
and
upon
my
husband
having
a
glass
of
beer
about
two
in
the
morning
she
asked
for
a
little
champagne
her
mind
was
so
clear
that
after
exchanging
a
few
sentences
with
her
nephew
in
the
lancashire
dialect
and
drinking
her
small
glass
of
champagne
she
said
with
a
smile
it
good
sleck
and
lay
still
for
a
while
at
three
she
wanted
to
be
turned
on
her
side
which
my
husband
did
with
tender
care
happy
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
her
better
than
any
one
else
could
do
it
as
she
said
i
believe
she
liked
to
feel
herself
in
his
arms
then
she
wished
ben
to
come
up
to
read
the
last
prayers
i
went
to
call
him
also
annie
and
emma
richard
and
mary
and
we
all
surrounded
her
bed
whilst
ben
was
reading
the
prayers
according
to
her
desire
and
my
husband
holding
one
of
her
hands
all
the
time
she
rested
her
eyes
upon
each
of
us
in
turn
closed
them
never
to
open
them
again
and
breathed
more
and
more
feebly
till
she
breathed
no
more
it
was
five
in
the
morning
her
death
had
been
a
peaceful
one
without
a
struggle
without
pain
the
death
we
may
desire
for
all
that
we
love
nevertheless
it
proved
a
sore
trial
for
my
husband
who
was
losing
the
oldest
affection
of
his
life
it
was
even
more
severe
than
such
losses
are
in
most
cases
however
great
may
have
been
the
affection
for
it
was
like
complete
severance
from
the
past
to
which
both
he
and
his
aunt
were
so
much
attached
when
they
were
together
the
reminiscences
of
the
old
days
at
hollins
of
the
old
friends
and
relations
of
the
quaint
old
customs
still
prevailing
in
the
youthful
days
of
the
misses
hamerton
and
the
great
change
since
were
frequent
topics
of
conversation
aunt
susan
was
extremely
intelligent
and
her
conversation
was
full
of
humor
she
also
wrote
capital
letters
and
kept
her
nephew
of
all
that
happened
to
their
common
friends
she
shared
in
his
great
love
and
admiration
for
the
beauties
of
nature
and
her
enjoyment
of
them
was
intense
when
walking
out
she
noticed
all
the
changes
of
effect
and
her
interest
never
palled
great
respect
to
her
memory
was
manifested
by
the
inhabitants
of
featherstone
high
and
low
who
filled
the
church
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
on
the
following
sunday
and
who
had
put
on
mourning
almost
without
exception
on
the
sunday
night
my
husband
went
alone
to
the
cemetery
by
moonlight
and
remained
long
at
the
grave
our
cousins
ben
and
annie
hinde
both
showed
great
sympathy
and
were
also
sorrowful
on
their
own
account
but
ben
thought
it
bad
for
mary
and
richard
to
be
shut
up
in
unrelieved
sadness
and
was
so
kind
as
to
take
them
to
leeds
pontefract
wakefield
and
york
in
turn
aunt
susan
had
left
a
little
legacy
to
each
of
her
nephews
and
nieces
and
the
rest
of
her
savings
to
my
husband
she
had
not
the
disposition
of
the
capital
which
had
been
left
in
trust
she
had
carefully
prepared
and
addressed
little
parcels
of
to
myself
and
to
each
of
my
children
jewels
seals
silver
as
well
as
some
ancient
and
curious
objects
which
had
been
preserved
as
relics
in
the
family
and
which
she
knew
we
should
value
and
respect
the
day
came
when
we
had
to
leave
our
dear
cousins
and
the
old
vicarage
so
full
of
associations
both
pleasant
and
painful
we
proceeded
towards
burnley
where
a
telegram
from
handsley
was
handed
to
my
husband
at
the
station
it
said
that
handsley
was
prevented
from
coming
himself
but
that
his
carriage
was
in
readiness
to
take
us
to
reedley
lodge
where
his
wife
was
awaiting
us
we
were
made
very
welcome
and
gilbert
was
happy
to
see
his
friends
again
after
so
long
a
separation
thursday
our
former
servant
in
the
highlands
came
to
see
us
in
the
evening
and
our
children
who
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
were
glad
of
the
meeting
handsley
was
a
distant
relation
of
my
husband
and
the
relationship
had
always
been
acknowledged
she
showed
herself
eager
to
divine
how
her
guests
would
like
to
spend
the
short
time
at
their
disposal
and
to
fulfil
their
wishes
she
was
aware
of
my
husband
faithful
attachment
to
old
associations
both
with
persons
and
with
places
and
she
drove
us
to
see
his
former
friends
who
were
still
alive
and
also
the
hollins
the
children
who
had
heard
so
much
about
it
were
greatly
interested
particularly
in
the
room
which
had
been
their
father
study
note
in
the
diary
october
went
to
see
the
brun
that
i
had
not
seen
since
my
marriage
drank
some
of
its
water
handsley
said
she
had
it
on
good
authority
that
john
hamerton
of
hellifield
peel
had
expressed
on
several
occasions
his
regret
for
the
division
existing
between
the
two
branches
of
the
family
and
his
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
my
husband
whose
works
he
knew
and
admired
now
it
had
been
a
lifelong
desire
of
his
to
visit
hellifield
peel
the
ancient
tower
with
the
romantic
history
and
the
seat
of
the
elder
branch
of
the
hamertons
there
could
be
no
better
opportunity
handsley
suggested
at
last
he
decided
for
the
attempt
and
on
the
following
morning
we
set
out
with
the
children
it
was
gilbert
intention
merely
to
send
his
card
and
beg
leave
to
see
the
tower
without
putting
forward
a
claim
of
any
kind
but
on
receipt
of
the
card
we
were
immediately
shown
into
the
and
most
cordially
received
by
john
hamerton
and
his
sister
i
was
at
once
struck
and
so
were
richard
and
mary
by
the
likeness
between
the
two
men
though
they
belonged
to
different
branches
of
the
family
my
husband
might
have
been
easily
taken
for
a
younger
brother
of
john
hamerton
they
were
both
tall
and
spare
the
elder
man
especially
both
were
straight
and
of
somewhat
proud
bearing
their
eyes
were
blue
with
a
straightforward
and
fearless
expression
the
lightness
of
the
beard
and
hair
together
with
the
development
of
the
forehead
completed
the
resemblance
though
the
whole
aspect
of
john
hamerton
was
that
of
a
country
gentleman
whilst
hard
intellectual
work
had
left
its
stamp
on
the
younger
man
countenance
they
got
on
very
amicably
together
and
we
were
invited
to
lunch
my
husband
eagerly
desired
to
go
over
the
house
but
alas
for
his
dreams
it
had
been
transformed
according
to
modern
wants
and
the
absence
of
all
relics
from
so
many
generations
was
very
striking
we
walked
in
the
park
where
we
admired
the
noble
trees
the
pond
and
at
some
distance
from
the
peel
the
beautiful
ribble
valley
the
subject
of
one
of
turner
landscapes
it
was
now
time
to
go
to
our
train
after
our
long
and
charming
visit
and
when
john
hamerton
had
given
some
photographs
of
hellifield
peel
to
my
husband
and
we
had
taken
a
friendly
leave
of
his
sister
he
accompanied
us
to
the
station
and
invited
us
to
the
peel
whenever
we
might
come
that
way
so
the
long
breach
in
the
family
now
belonged
to
the
past
and
was
replaced
by
mutual
goodwill
and
friendliness
gilbert
wrote
in
his
diary
october
one
of
the
most
delightful
days
of
my
life
the
day
after
he
went
to
burnley
with
handsley
and
saw
the
new
school
before
going
to
the
council
chamber
where
a
public
reception
had
been
organized
in
his
honor
and
where
he
delivered
an
oration
in
acknowledgment
of
many
flattering
speeches
the
formal
part
of
the
reception
over
he
shook
hands
with
every
one
who
came
forward
to
speak
to
him
among
whom
he
still
remembered
a
few
the
afternoon
ended
with
a
visit
to
the
mechanics
institution
in
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
take
great
interest
he
had
been
much
moved
and
gratified
by
the
welcome
offered
him
at
burnley
and
never
forgot
it
the
journey
to
london
was
very
trying
on
account
of
the
cold
fog
and
snow
the
train
ploughed
its
way
slowly
and
cautiously
amidst
the
explosive
signals
which
did
not
add
to
our
comfort
we
felt
very
sorry
for
and
seeley
who
were
sitting
up
for
us
so
late
into
the
night
on
the
days
following
our
arrival
my
husband
introduced
richard
to
his
friends
took
him
about
london
and
chose
lodgings
for
him
he
also
saw
stephens
who
wished
him
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
post
of
professor
of
fine
arts
at
oxford
but
he
did
not
feel
tempted
he
called
upon
browning
who
was
unfortunately
out
but
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
closing
the
door
he
felt
a
resistance
and
saw
a
lady
the
sister
of
robert
browning
she
explained
to
whom
his
card
had
been
handed
and
who
by
mistake
had
read
the
name
as
hamilton
it
was
only
after
looking
at
it
more
attentively
that
she
had
rushed
down
the
stairs
to
detain
the
visitor
he
went
up
with
her
to
the
where
he
found
orr
the
sister
of
sir
frederick
leighton
and
they
had
a
long
and
pleasant
talk
together
some
days
later
he
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
browning
it
was
lucky
that
gilbert
had
good
health
just
then
and
richard
to
go
about
with
him
in
london
for
i
was
laid
up
with
a
bad
cold
the
result
of
having
walked
a
whole
day
in
the
snow
making
calls
without
an
opportunity
of
drying
my
boots
or
of
warming
my
feet
seeley
was
my
kind
and
thoughtful
nurse
and
thanks
to
her
care
i
gradually
recovered
richard
came
to
say
and
we
left
nutfield
house
for
france
this
time
we
did
not
go
through
paris
but
visited
everything
of
interest
at
rouen
dreux
orl√©ans
and
bourges
the
diary
says
november
in
the
evening
we
reached
home
very
happy
to
be
back
again
on
the
of
the
same
month
be
received
a
letter
from
sagar
from
which
i
quote
the
following
passage
sufficient
time
has
not
yet
elapsed
i
hope
for
you
to
forget
us
in
burnley
here
and
the
pleasure
we
had
in
seeing
you
in
the
council
chamber
on
that
to
us
memorable
saturday
next
year
will
be
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
institute
and
we
are
going
to
celebrate
this
and
the
general
success
we
have
had
by
a
week
jubilee
the
whole
of
new
year
week
the
jubilee
will
take
the
form
of
a
conversazione
a
banquet
and
a
general
exhibition
occupying
every
room
of
the
place
except
two
south
kensington
authorities
are
sending
us
six
cases
of
examples
of
fabrics
pottery
and
about
sixty
frames
of
pictures
drawings
etc
can
you
use
your
influence
for
us
in
obtaining
a
representative
exhibition
say
of
etchings
or
anything
else
of
a
suitable
character
that
might
suggest
itself
to
you
together
if
possible
and
this
would
delight
us
all
with
your
presence
or
in
the
absence
of
this
if
you
ca
be
here
a
short
letter
for
me
to
read
as
on
the
opening
of
the
the
letter
was
sent
in
due
time
and
acknowledged
with
grateful
thanks
seeley
was
so
kind
as
to
send
us
news
of
richard
from
time
to
time
he
wrote
in
march
richard
has
shown
me
some
of
his
drawings
i
think
he
is
making
progress
one
of
his
last
drawings
seemed
to
me
excellent
very
tender
and
subtle
he
was
down
at
kinsgton
with
us
the
other
day
this
opinion
of
seeley
gave
great
pleasure
to
my
husband
who
had
always
entertained
doubts
about
the
range
of
his
son
artistic
talent
in
the
same
month
he
was
asked
to
send
a
biographical
note
for
men
of
the
time
a
proof
that
his
reputation
was
on
the
increase
and
haden
who
had
just
come
back
from
america
said
that
his
works
were
held
there
in
the
highest
esteem
the
book
on
paris
necessitated
another
journey
and
my
husband
made
the
time
of
it
to
coincide
with
the
opening
of
the
salon
this
time
we
stopped
at
auxerre
and
visited
the
four
churches
the
museum
and
the
room
in
which
are
exhibited
the
relics
of
marshal
davoust
the
diary
says
april
began
this
morning
another
diary
in
english
to
record
the
impressions
which
may
serve
for
my
literary
work
on
may
we
had
a
carriage
accident
which
might
have
been
serious
our
horse
took
fright
at
sight
of
a
steam
tram
and
ran
away
on
the
footpath
at
a
furious
rate
dashing
the
carriage
against
the
trees
and
until
he
slipped
and
fell
at
full
length
on
the
asphalt
my
husband
had
been
able
to
jump
out
but
a
sudden
jerk
had
prevented
me
from
following
him
at
the
moment
and
then
there
was
danger
of
being
hurt
between
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
the
banging
door
gilbert
had
been
running
hatless
after
the
carriage
to
hold
the
door
and
enable
me
to
jump
out
and
he
just
succeeded
as
the
horse
slipped
down
and
upset
the
carriage
i
was
out
in
time
to
escape
being
hurt
but
of
course
we
were
both
a
good
deal
shaken
and
went
back
to
rest
at
our
hotel
we
had
hardly
been
a
week
in
paris
when
my
husband
began
to
suffer
from
nervousness
a
tramway
had
been
laid
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
the
vibration
prevented
him
from
sleeping
then
spring
was
always
trying
to
him
and
above
all
he
wished
himself
in
the
country
seeley
wrote
nature
evidently
intended
you
for
a
savage
how
in
the
world
did
you
come
to
be
a
literary
man
what
must
frenchmen
think
of
you
in
paris
and
miserable
even
hamerton
must
feel
ashamed
of
you
he
acknowledged
that
he
was
more
happy
in
a
primitive
sort
of
existence
than
in
one
too
perfectly
civilized
still
he
could
not
endure
the
privation
of
books
and
he
would
have
felt
keenly
the
absence
of
works
of
art
but
he
was
in
deeper
sympathy
with
the
beauty
of
nature
than
with
artistic
beauty
to
be
denied
the
last
would
have
been
a
great
privation
but
in
the
absence
of
the
first
he
really
could
not
live
we
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
acquainted
with
who
had
recently
married
wyld
daughter
and
who
being
a
invited
us
to
go
and
see
his
gallery
in
the
rue
georges
there
were
a
great
many
fine
works
that
my
husband
greatly
admired
particularly
those
by
corot
daubigny
and
troyon
and
the
scheme
for
the
book
on
landscape
having
been
settled
with
seeley
he
begged
to
allow
reproductions
of
some
of
the
pictures
to
appear
in
his
future
work
it
was
readily
granted
this
selection
of
pictures
for
the
book
on
landscape
gave
the
author
much
additional
labor
but
it
was
better
to
do
it
now
that
he
was
in
paris
than
have
to
come
again
on
purpose
seeley
had
offered
to
run
over
and
help
with
the
arrangements
but
was
prevented
by
a
slight
accident
he
then
proposed
that
photographs
of
the
pictures
chosen
should
be
sent
to
him
that
he
might
have
a
vote
we
were
very
near
the
end
of
our
stay
in
paris
and
gilbert
wanted
to
go
to
the
office
of
having
some
business
there
and
wishing
to
say
farewell
to
the
manager
he
had
also
invited
the
sons
of
schmitt
who
were
now
in
paris
to
meet
us
in
the
square
richelieu
and
to
dine
afterwards
at
a
restaurant
he
thought
that
he
could
manage
both
things
on
the
same
day
however
we
were
hardly
out
of
the
omnibus
when
i
perceived
he
was
unwell
but
i
had
not
time
to
propose
anything
before
he
started
off
at
such
a
rate
that
i
was
obliged
to
run
to
follow
him
the
worst
symptoms
were
betrayed
by
his
gait
by
the
congestion
of
face
and
neck
and
by
the
hard
stare
of
the
eyes
it
was
too
late
to
take
a
carriage
he
could
not
stop
and
could
not
be
spoken
to
i
saw
that
a
sure
instinct
was
guiding
him
out
of
the
crowded
street
to
the
and
least
frequented
places
and
i
strove
to
remain
by
his
side
in
the
course
of
about
twenty
minutes
i
noticed
a
slackening
in
his
pace
and
as
i
had
been
looking
about
for
some
refuge
i
remarked
through
the
open
doors
of
a
small
caf√©
an
empty
and
motioned
to
him
to
follow
me
there
it
was
almost
dark
and
there
was
a
divan
running
along
three
sides
of
the
wall
i
made
him
lie
down
upon
it
and
went
to
tell
the
who
happened
to
be
the
mistress
of
the
house
that
my
husband
had
felt
suddenly
unwell
and
required
a
little
rest
she
made
no
fuss
did
not
press
me
to
send
for
a
doctor
or
to
administer
anything
she
merely
promised
to
prevent
any
one
from
going
into
that
back
room
and
said
we
might
remain
there
undisturbed
as
long
as
was
needed
after
my
husband
asked
for
a
little
brandy
and
water
and
gradually
became
himself
again
we
remained
about
two
hours
in
the
little
room
reading
or
pretending
to
read
the
newspapers
and
such
was
gilbert
courage
and
resolution
that
he
went
to
keep
the
appointment
with
the
young
men
he
had
invited
i
knew
i
was
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
what
had
happened
and
i
was
miserably
anxious
about
the
effect
that
a
dinner
in
a
restaurant
might
have
upon
the
nerves
of
my
poor
patient
strange
to
say
he
bore
it
very
well
and
played
his
part
as
entertainer
quite
merrily
but
after
dinner
i
longed
to
get
him
away
and
proposed
to
take
an
open
carriage
for
a
drive
in
the
champs
√©lys√©es
this
was
accepted
and
i
believe
he
really
enjoyed
it
we
agreed
to
leave
paris
the
following
evening
and
i
went
to
town
alone
in
the
afternoon
for
a
few
things
which
had
been
postponed
to
the
last
moment
we
reached
autun
on
may
at
which
date
the
diary
says
i
am
very
happy
to
be
in
my
home
which
i
prefer
to
all
the
finest
palaces
in
paris
in
the
spring
he
had
suffered
repeatedly
from
great
pain
in
one
of
his
legs
and
had
attributed
it
to
rheumatism
now
he
began
to
feel
the
pain
again
in
the
left
foot
and
it
soon
became
so
acute
that
the
doctor
was
sent
for
he
said
it
was
an
attack
of
gout
but
gave
hope
of
an
ultimate
cure
because
the
patient
constitution
was
not
a
gouty
one
the
cause
of
the
attack
was
insufficient
exercise
in
the
open
air
he
prescribed
a
severe
regimen
less
sedentary
work
and
as
much
walking
and
riding
as
possible
for
nights
my
husband
could
not
go
to
bed
but
remained
stretched
on
a
couch
or
sitting
in
an
when
the
pain
was
less
severe
he
laid
himself
down
upon
the
bed
for
a
short
time
but
he
hardly
ever
got
to
sleep
his
fortitude
and
patience
were
incredible
and
he
bore
the
almost
intolerable
sufferings
with
admirable
resignation
he
tried
to
read
and
even
to
write
upon
a
desk
placed
on
his
knees
and
talked
much
about
his
plan
for
the
book
on
landscape
seeley
wrote
i
am
heartily
sorry
to
hear
of
your
attack
of
gout
but
i
am
relieved
to
hear
that
it
is
not
erysipelas
which
must
have
been
alarming
possibly
the
discomfort
you
suffered
in
paris
may
have
been
a
premonitory
symptom
of
this
attack
and
you
may
look
forward
to
the
enjoyment
of
better
health
when
it
has
passed
away
haden
declared
that
he
felt
delighted
by
this
attack
as
indicative
of
a
change
for
the
better
in
the
constitution
he
hoped
that
the
tendency
to
nervousness
and
insomnia
would
disappear
or
at
any
rate
greatly
diminish
we
were
now
daily
expecting
richard
and
seeley
had
said
on
june
richard
was
with
us
on
saturday
his
farewell
visit
we
like
him
more
and
more
every
time
we
see
him
he
was
coming
back
at
my
request
to
pass
an
examination
in
english
the
same
that
his
brother
had
passed
successfully
two
years
ago
for
the
after
which
he
got
his
post
of
professor
at
m√¢con
i
had
thought
that
if
richard
failed
as
an
artist
he
might
be
glad
to
fall
back
upon
a
professorship
and
it
turned
out
so
his
father
was
pleased
to
notice
how
much
better
and
more
fluently
he
spoke
english
on
his
return
from
london
but
at
the
same
time
after
seeing
the
drawings
done
in
england
he
was
confirmed
in
the
opinion
that
originality
and
invention
were
lacking
to
make
a
real
artist
of
his
younger
son
what
ought
to
be
said
was
very
perplexing
the
drawings
were
good
enough
in
their
way
the
progress
undeniable
but
they
were
only
copies
even
when
done
from
the
living
model
the
creative
spark
the
individual
artistic
stamp
were
absent
my
husband
allowed
himself
some
time
for
consideration
before
warning
richard
that
he
thought
him
mistaken
in
his
choice
of
a
career
however
after
having
passed
a
successful
examination
it
was
richard
who
of
his
own
accord
told
his
father
that
he
felt
very
doubtful
about
the
ultimate
result
of
his
artistic
studies
he
believed
they
were
begun
too
late
and
that
his
chances
against
students
who
had
several
start
were
very
small
they
had
been
drawing
and
painting
since
the
age
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
whilst
he
was
preparing
himself
for
his
degrees
the
ease
with
which
he
had
carried
off
the
made
him
sanguine
about
being
ready
for
the
in
the
course
of
a
year
after
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
post
in
the
university
he
would
not
abandon
art
he
said
but
would
not
follow
it
as
a
profession
it
was
a
great
relief
that
the
resolution
should
have
been
his
own
but
it
surprised
seeley
considerably
and
he
wrote
to
my
husband
from
what
you
tell
me
of
his
want
of
enjoyment
in
the
practice
of
art
the
determination
seems
wise
i
suppose
we
take
it
for
granted
that
a
man
must
take
pleasure
in
doing
whatever
he
can
do
well
but
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
ability
and
inclination
should
always
go
together
a
man
with
a
good
eye
and
that
general
ability
and
power
of
application
which
make
a
good
student
may
easily
be
a
draughtsman
above
the
average
but
it
is
quite
intelligible
that
he
should
take
more
pleasure
in
other
studies
at
the
end
of
august
gilbert
went
with
stephen
and
his
eldest
nephew
maurice
pelletier
for
a
cruise
of
ten
days
on
the
sa√¥ne
they
were
on
the
new
catamaran
and
enjoyed
their
voyage
thoroughly
on
october
richard
left
us
to
go
to
paris
to
have
the
benefit
of
cours
de
la
as
a
preparation
for
and
in
december
stephen
asked
for
a
year
leave
of
absence
from
his
post
in
order
to
pursue
his
english
studies
in
london
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
the
father
health
should
have
been
impaired
by
anxiety
and
his
brain
overtaxed
by
the
numerous
works
he
had
undertaken
to
meet
his
responsibilities
he
was
at
the
same
time
writing
human
intercourse
for
macmillan
paris
for
the
portfolio
and
the
book
on
landscape
was
begun
in
november
he
had
written
a
very
long
letter
to
miss
mainly
in
explanation
of
the
word
sheer
used
for
boats
then
about
our
doings
and
he
says
we
have
had
the
house
upset
by
workpeople
but
we
are
settled
again
after
a
great
bother
which
i
dreaded
before
as
montaigne
used
to
dread
similar
disturbances
but
now
it
is
over
i
feel
myself
much
more
comfortable
and
orderly
though
the
reform
has
cost
me
a
considerable
loss
of
time
the
rooms
look
prettier
and
are
less
crammed
i
got
the
other
day
a
letter
of
twenty
pages
from
a
cousin
in
new
zealand
who
had
never
written
to
me
for
thirty
years
it
was
the
most
interesting
biography
of
struggle
adventure
danger
hard
work
and
final
success
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
men
who
go
through
such
lives
have
not
the
literary
talent
to
make
autobiographies
that
can
be
published
i
have
another
cousin
whose
history
is
as
good
as
crusoe
and
i
have
engaged
him
to
write
it
but
he
never
will
if
i
lived
near
him
i
could
gradually
get
the
material
out
of
him
but
at
a
distance
i
can
not
get
him
even
to
write
rough
notes
on
the
other
hand
we
literary
people
are
quite
humdrum
people
in
our
ways
of
life
and
our
autobiographies
would
generally
be
of
little
interest
i
have
been
reading
ariosto
lately
in
italian
and
am
struck
both
by
his
qualities
and
deficiencies
he
is
all
on
the
surface
but
what
a
wealth
of
inventive
power
and
what
a
unflagging
energy
and
cheerfulness
the
descriptions
are
frequently
superb
and
there
is
a
go
in
the
style
generally
that
is
very
stimulating
it
is
like
watching
the
flow
of
a
bright
rapid
brimming
river
i
do
think
we
have
any
english
poet
of
the
same
kind
spenser
is
rather
like
but
heavier
and
just
lacking
that
brightness
in
combination
with
movement
spenser
and
byron
together
contain
many
of
the
qualities
of
ariosto
the
first
note
in
the
diary
for
says
i
must
try
to
economize
time
in
all
little
things
where
economy
is
possible
without
injury
to
the
quality
of
work
i
can
not
economize
it
very
much
in
the
work
itself
without
risk
of
lowering
quality
it
was
a
pleasure
for
my
husband
to
see
that
his
articles
on
the
architecture
of
paris
had
been
so
favorably
noticed
as
to
bring
requests
for
contributions
from
the
builder
and
seeley
wrote
to
him
i
think
it
is
a
feather
in
your
cap
that
your
architectural
notes
should
have
brought
you
invitations
to
write
for
professional
journals
my
pelletier
had
left
algiers
and
was
now
√©conome
at
the
lyc√©e
at
marseilles
he
had
suggested
that
it
being
possible
to
go
from
chalon
to
marseilles
by
water
we
might
pay
him
a
visit
and
see
the
course
of
the
rh√¥ne
at
the
same
time
my
husband
felt
greatly
tempted
to
accept
for
more
than
one
reason
he
would
be
able
at
the
same
time
to
take
notes
and
to
make
observations
on
the
way
for
the
book
on
landscape
and
to
come
to
a
conclusion
about
the
possibility
of
the
rh√¥ne
scheme
we
might
divide
the
places
of
interest
into
two
series
and
see
one
of
them
in
going
and
the
other
in
coming
back
with
a
pleasant
time
of
rest
at
our
friend
in
the
interval
the
itinerary
was
carefully
prepared
to
miss
nothing
on
the
way
and
on
april
we
left
my
mother
in
charge
of
the
house
whilst
my
husband
myself
and
mary
started
from
chalon
where
we
went
on
board
the
steamer
for
m√¢con
my
husband
having
often
seen
the
town
was
left
to
his
writing
whilst
i
took
mary
to
see
the
church
of
brou
from
m√¢con
to
lyons
we
enjoyed
the
landscape
from
the
deck
of
the
steamer
particularly
tr√©voux
and
barbe
as
we
neared
lyons
note
in
the
diary
we
passed
through
some
lovely
scenery
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
never
to
boat
with
the
below
courzon
so
long
as
he
remained
on
the
water
or
in
little
places
gilbert
was
well
enough
and
enjoyed
himself
exceedingly
but
as
soon
as
we
were
obliged
to
stay
in
large
towns
he
began
to
suffer
at
lyons
having
attempted
to
go
to
the
museum
when
it
was
crowded
he
had
to
hurry
out
and
it
is
a
miracle
how
he
managed
to
reach
the
hotel
where
he
went
through
one
of
the
worst
attacks
of
nervousness
in
his
life
it
did
not
last
very
long
and
when
he
was
well
again
i
took
mary
to
fourvi√®res
by
rail
we
proceeded
to
vienne
then
to
valence
and
where
it
was
pitch
dark
as
we
got
out
and
raining
heavily
to
our
dismay
we
saw
no
sign
of
either
omnibus
or
carriage
however
a
man
was
coming
up
to
us
in
a
leisurely
way
with
a
broken
lantern
and
he
explained
that
the
had
not
come
because
it
was
raining
he
led
us
to
a
very
queer
apparently
deserted
hotel
where
the
getting
of
sheets
for
the
narrow
beds
seemed
to
be
an
almost
insurmountable
difficulty
and
as
to
cases
for
the
pillows
in
sheer
despair
of
ever
getting
any
we
had
to
use
clean
towels
out
of
our
bags
in
their
stead
the
room
was
adorned
with
a
gallery
of
pastel
portraits
so
wan
and
faded
that
they
looked
by
the
faint
gleam
of
moonlight
through
the
shutters
like
a
procession
of
ghosts
and
there
were
so
many
chairs
in
mary
room
and
such
an
immensely
long
table
that
it
must
surely
have
been
used
by
the
ghosts
as
a
nevertheless
we
slept
soundly
had
a
charming
excursion
in
the
morning
and
a
good
though
late
afterwards
for
it
chanced
to
be
the
drawing
of
lots
for
the
conscription
and
the
hotel
was
crowded
by
famished
officials
mayor
gendarmes
officers
etc
of
course
there
was
nothing
for
unofficial
people
like
us
but
to
wait
and
catch
the
dishes
as
they
left
the
important
table
and
appropriate
what
might
remain
upon
them
there
was
enough
for
us
and
the
wine
was
excellent
so
good
indeed
that
we
thought
of
having
a
cask
sent
to
la
tuilerie
the
great
people
having
departed
we
were
able
to
talk
at
our
leisure
with
the
landlady
but
all
of
a
sudden
we
became
aware
that
it
was
getting
time
to
go
and
asked
for
the
bill
oh
there
was
no
need
for
a
bill
she
could
reckon
in
her
head
but
there
was
no
hurry
we
explained
that
there
was
some
hurry
as
the
carriage
we
had
ordered
would
be
at
the
door
presently
mais
pourquoi
pourquoi
vous
en
aller
exclaimed
the
simple
woman
with
an
air
of
consternation
que
vous
pas
bien
ici
bourg
and√©ol
where
we
stopped
next
is
a
very
interesting
place
my
husband
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
little
town
and
the
h√¥tel
nicolai
our
arrival
created
quite
a
stir
in
the
sleepy
regular
routine
of
the
little
bourg
and
the
doors
and
windows
it
can
boast
of
became
alive
with
curious
eyes
as
we
passed
along
the
deserted
streets
in
an
open
carriage
we
were
driven
to
pont
esprit
and
noticed
the
long
lines
of
mulberry
trees
on
each
side
of
the
roads
the
driver
explained
that
they
are
planted
to
feed
the
silkworms
and
that
in
two
months
they
would
be
leafless
we
took
the
steamer
again
at
pont
esprit
late
in
the
following
day
for
avignon
in
the
morning
of
sunday
we
all
went
to
hear
high
mass
in
the
cathedral
then
to
the
palace
of
the
popes
and
round
the
walls
in
the
afternoon
we
visited
the
tomb
of
john
stuart
mill
and
my
husband
left
his
card
at
the
house
of
miss
taylor
we
then
heard
music
in
the
open
air
and
saw
the
old
bridge
it
was
a
very
pleasant
fortnight
that
we
spent
at
marseilles
with
our
relations
the
only
drawback
being
gilbert
uncertain
health
which
prevented
him
from
going
out
much
though
close
to
the
expanse
of
the
mediterranean
i
suppose
he
had
the
feeling
expressed
in
the
preface
to
landscape
in
these
words
the
lover
of
wilderness
always
feels
confined
among
the
evidences
of
a
minutely
careful
civilization
towards
the
end
of
the
day
when
the
blinding
glare
of
sunshine
was
softened
we
generally
went
to
the
vieux
port
where
there
was
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
picturesque
scenes
among
sailors
of
all
nations
and
ships
of
every
description
or
to
la
joliette
to
watch
the
arrival
or
departure
of
the
chinese
vessels
and
other
curious
craft
at
other
times
we
walked
in
the
pare
borelli
or
on
the
corniche
a
novel
feature
in
our
life
was
the
frequent
visits
to
the
theatre
with
our
friends
it
was
most
remarkable
that
my
husband
should
take
such
a
sudden
fancy
to
the
opera
he
could
not
account
for
it
himself
except
by
noticing
that
he
felt
at
home
in
it
we
invariably
took
so
that
he
only
saw
the
musicians
actors
and
scenery
hardly
any
of
the
occupants
of
the
theatre
except
those
in
the
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
the
space
of
a
fortnight
he
heard
more
operas
than
in
all
the
rest
of
his
life
he
wrote
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
a
very
quiet
room
which
pelletier
who
was
well
acquainted
with
his
tastes
had
fitted
up
accordingly
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
visit
on
our
return
we
stopped
to
see
tarascon
and
beaucaire
where
we
had
still
some
friends
in
the
last
place
the
director
of
the
obligingly
showed
us
through
the
house
which
had
been
my
father
we
also
visited
n√Æmes
orange
and
mont√©limart
giving
a
whole
day
to
each
place
it
was
already
very
hot
in
the
south
and
the
perfume
of
the
acacias
in
full
bloom
everywhere
was
almost
more
than
we
could
bear
especially
at
mont√©limart
at
orange
after
seeing
the
noble
roman
remains
we
partly
ascended
the
hill
to
see
the
ventoux
range
of
mountains
then
went
on
to
valence
for
the
night
we
were
on
board
the
steamer
at
five
in
the
morning
and
had
a
delightful
voyage
to
lyons
during
which
gilbert
took
copious
notes
in
the
he
had
prepared
on
purpose
after
resting
a
day
we
went
straight
on
to
chalon
by
boat
and
had
a
pleasant
day
with
the
captain
who
invited
us
to
with
him
on
board
on
the
whole
we
were
satisfied
with
our
journey
but
the
information
my
husband
had
collected
on
the
way
convinced
him
that
the
rh√¥ne
project
as
he
had
planned
it
was
utterly
impracticable
we
were
soon
in
great
anxiety
about
our
relatives
at
marseilles
for
we
learned
that
cholera
had
broken
out
there
early
in
july
gilbert
without
the
least
hesitation
immediately
wrote
to
pelletier
inviting
him
and
his
children
to
la
tuilerie
where
they
would
be
safe
from
the
terrible
scourge
our
readily
availed
himself
of
the
invitation
for
his
children
but
thought
it
his
duty
to
remain
at
his
post
and
set
an
example
to
the
population
the
arrival
of
our
nephews
and
niece
from
the
very
centre
of
contamination
did
not
tend
to
augment
our
popularity
in
the
neighborhood
and
we
were
made
to
understand
very
plainly
that
the
house
was
tabooed
along
with
ourselves
our
milk
from
the
farm
just
opposite
to
our
house
was
brought
to
us
and
deposited
in
the
middle
of
the
road
where
our
servant
had
to
go
and
fetch
it
no
one
amongst
the
inmates
of
the
farm
being
sufficiently
courageous
either
to
bring
it
within
our
walls
or
to
deliver
it
to
a
servant
who
had
approached
les
marseillais
ever
since
richard
had
come
home
he
had
been
steadily
preparing
himself
for
his
examination
with
the
help
of
his
father
every
day
they
read
english
poetry
together
and
gilbert
gave
him
all
the
necessary
information
as
to
the
meaning
rhythm
and
structure
in
moments
of
relaxation
he
joined
the
family
circle
frequently
enlivened
by
the
presence
of
a
young
couple
and
mme
pochon
who
had
recently
come
to
live
at
the
where
the
husband
was
managing
engineer
the
lady
had
a
charming
voice
and
used
to
sing
in
the
church
with
mary
who
played
the
harmonium
this
led
to
an
intimacy
and
with
an
additional
singer
and
pianist
in
the
person
of
my
niece
we
often
organized
private
concerts
in
which
my
husband
took
great
pleasure
there
was
nothing
he
enjoyed
more
than
such
private
recreation
except
perhaps
the
satisfaction
of
taking
trouble
to
make
things
agreeable
to
others
here
is
an
instance
among
many
on
a
fearfully
hot
day
in
august
he
overheard
a
who
talking
to
her
husband
from
the
top
of
a
wagon
which
had
just
stopped
near
la
tuilerie
was
lamenting
her
inability
to
find
a
shady
place
for
the
of
the
officers
who
would
shortly
arrive
he
saw
at
once
that
he
might
offer
these
hot
and
weary
warriors
the
unexpected
pleasure
of
a
cool
so
he
went
to
the
and
proposed
to
have
the
officers
table
set
upon
the
lawn
under
the
shady
elder
trees
the
woman
could
hardly
credit
such
a
charitable
offer
and
warned
him
that
the
grass
would
certainly
suffer
from
it
but
he
only
smiled
saying
that
it
could
not
be
helped
but
that
he
hoped
to
induce
the
grass
to
grow
again
with
copious
watering
the
table
was
set
chairs
were
brought
from
the
house
also
live
charcoal
for
the
portable
stove
and
we
witnessed
a
very
entertaining
scene
from
behind
the
shutters
when
the
regiment
halted
the
colonel
began
to
swear
and
scold
at
sight
of
the
white
dusty
sultry
road
where
the
had
stopped
and
for
a
few
moments
refused
to
listen
to
her
explanations
but
when
he
saw
hamerton
coming
out
of
the
garden
gate
to
invite
him
inside
with
his
brother
officers
he
dismounted
to
salute
him
and
stood
fixed
in
a
state
of
ecstacy
before
the
inviting
white
looking
so
fresh
and
cool
between
the
green
grass
of
the
lawn
and
the
green
leaves
of
the
trees
the
other
officers
shared
this
pleasant
impression
and
were
profuse
in
their
thanks
after
a
short
talk
with
the
master
of
the
house
who
was
called
away
to
his
own
by
the
bell
they
drank
his
health
and
sat
down
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
to
their
meal
it
was
not
only
the
lawn
which
was
thus
invaded
for
there
being
in
the
courtyard
a
deep
well
of
deliciously
cold
water
the
soldiers
were
not
slow
to
find
their
way
to
it
and
after
quenching
their
thirst
and
filling
up
their
they
stretched
themselves
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
wherever
there
was
shade
either
from
tree
or
wall
this
general
enjoyment
of
an
hour
delicious
rest
amply
compensated
my
husband
for
the
havoc
done
in
the
garden
we
were
rather
a
numerous
household
then
at
with
the
addition
of
my
mother
pelletier
and
his
three
children
my
brother
his
wife
and
two
little
girls
so
that
when
the
youngest
officer
entered
the
as
spokesman
to
reiterate
the
thanks
of
his
brother
officers
he
felt
abashed
by
so
many
eyes
fixed
upon
him
still
he
managed
to
get
through
his
duty
somewhat
hurriedly
and
soon
after
the
regiment
was
marching
off
the
men
now
rested
and
refreshed
singing
lustily
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
waving
their
towards
la
tuilerie
stephen
arrived
for
the
vacation
towards
the
middle
of
august
but
the
suspense
in
which
we
were
kept
about
richard
examination
was
most
unfavorable
to
the
health
of
his
father
at
last
there
were
great
rejoicings
when
a
telegram
conveyed
to
us
his
brilliant
success
he
came
out
second
on
the
list
the
first
being
a
lady
miss
williams
of
whom
he
had
often
spoken
to
us
in
high
terms
having
been
with
her
as
a
student
at
the
sorbonne
and
who
has
since
become
directress
of
that
most
useful
institution
the
guild
we
were
told
that
richard
was
the
youngest
in
france
and
of
course
we
were
proud
of
it
seeley
wrote
i
heartily
congratulate
you
on
richard
great
success
it
is
not
often
that
a
young
man
can
so
speedily
justify
his
choice
of
a
career
human
intercourse
was
published
in
september
and
sold
well
in
spite
of
its
cold
reception
by
the
press
hamerton
did
not
allow
unfavorable
criticism
to
disturb
him
much
there
was
only
one
kind
of
attack
that
he
did
not
bear
patiently
i
believe
and
that
was
being
told
that
he
had
no
i
do
pretend
to
have
genius
i
never
said
i
had
then
why
make
it
a
reproach
he
used
to
say
there
was
a
second
edition
as
early
as
december
and
i
give
here
a
fragment
of
one
of
the
numerous
letters
the
author
received
which
may
prove
that
public
opinion
was
more
favorable
to
the
book
than
the
critics
you
have
given
me
some
pleasant
hours
as
i
read
and
pondered
over
remarks
of
yours
in
intercourse
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
you
have
tinted
the
current
of
my
life
i
hereby
certify
to
my
gratitude
not
that
i
am
of
any
account
in
the
world
but
because
it
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
duty
and
because
were
our
positions
reversed
it
would
please
me
to
know
that
i
was
appreciated
even
by
a
stranger
what
you
say
about
priests
and
women
interests
me
deeply
as
a
clergyman
the
letter
contained
eleven
pages
of
confidential
talk
mostly
about
personal
experiences
in
the
discharge
of
professional
duty
clearly
showing
that
the
subject
had
not
been
treated
in
vain
in
human
intercourse
there
had
been
a
serious
strike
at
the
of
la
comaille
close
to
and
the
hands
now
that
the
winter
was
coming
upon
them
were
distressed
and
greatly
disheartened
hamerton
tried
his
best
to
mollify
the
engineer
and
to
reason
with
the
men
and
make
them
see
that
the
strike
could
not
bring
them
any
advantage
at
last
the
workmen
asked
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
their
work
but
the
engineer
refused
to
take
back
the
promoters
of
the
strike
among
whom
was
the
husband
of
one
of
our
former
servants
the
poor
woman
came
in
tears
to
beseech
her
bon
monsieur
to
obtain
pochon
forgiveness
for
if
her
husband
were
kept
out
of
work
much
longer
her
three
little
children
would
have
to
starve
the
landlord
having
already
threatened
to
turn
them
out
my
husband
had
paid
the
rent
of
their
cottage
for
a
year
and
now
he
pleaded
so
warmly
the
cause
of
the
deluded
workmen
to
madame
pochon
asking
for
her
influence
in
their
favor
that
together
they
carried
their
point
and
so
gave
comfort
to
several
poor
families
with
the
exception
of
the
two
ringleaders
who
had
used
threats
and
violent
language
all
the
hands
were
taken
back
again
our
former
gratitude
still
survives
one
of
her
children
never
fails
to
send
the
united
wishes
of
the
family
for
the
new
year
and
the
letters
always
begin
with
nos
chers
bienfaiteurs
the
great
kindness
and
generosity
of
were
so
well
known
in
our
neighborhood
that
the
people
had
no
hesitation
in
applying
at
la
tuilerie
for
clothing
medicines
or
help
of
any
kind
even
the
beggars
who
came
regularly
lingered
after
pocketing
their
penny
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
personally
as
he
crossed
the
courtyard
or
went
out
on
the
road
for
then
as
an
old
woman
confided
to
one
of
the
maids
on
est
s√ªr
pi√®ce
blanche
he
was
entirely
free
from
false
pride
and
looked
down
upon
no
one
deserving
respect
one
girl
whom
we
had
had
in
our
service
for
five
years
and
who
only
left
us
to
be
married
begged
as
a
great
favor
that
mary
should
be
godmother
to
her
child
he
gave
his
leave
at
once
being
the
first
to
recall
how
attached
and
devoted
she
had
been
to
our
daughter
when
a
baby
and
when
she
called
with
her
husband
he
always
shook
hands
with
them
both
and
offered
them
refreshments
he
showed
the
same
ready
sympathy
to
the
class
of
young
authors
and
artists
in
want
of
help
and
advice
trying
to
get
them
employment
and
helping
them
to
improve
their
work
he
often
accepted
for
the
portfolio
articles
which
greatly
increased
his
labors
for
he
had
to
correct
and
to
rewrite
parts
if
he
perceived
some
promise
of
talent
in
their
authors
he
also
took
the
trouble
of
criticizing
minutely
numbers
of
etchings
and
drawings
pointing
out
possible
alterations
which
might
make
them
acceptable
to
the
public
and
by
so
doing
he
helped
to
form
and
encouraged
a
great
number
of
artists
seeley
was
anxious
that
the
book
on
landscape
might
be
out
in
good
time
for
the
christmas
sale
and
explained
the
many
reasons
which
made
it
desirable
but
although
the
author
had
done
his
best
to
be
ready
he
began
to
doubt
of
the
possibility
having
been
anxious
about
it
and
hurried
he
became
subject
to
painful
attacks
of
palpitation
as
soon
as
seeley
heard
of
it
he
wrote
pray
do
not
run
any
risk
of
ruining
your
health
tell
me
exactly
how
you
stand
how
much
remains
to
be
written
then
we
will
face
the
position
like
sensible
people
and
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
you
must
neither
risk
your
health
by
overwork
nor
your
reputation
by
hasty
work
what
a
pity
it
is
that
you
do
enjoy
games
i
find
tennis
such
a
relief
from
worries
i
have
also
a
double
tricycle
on
which
i
ride
every
morning
with
my
garden
boy
it
is
a
capital
exercise
the
steering
occupies
one
thoughts
almost
as
well
as
a
game
one
ca
think
much
of
business
while
going
seven
or
eight
miles
an
hour
with
the
probability
that
any
considerable
swerve
will
lead
to
an
upset
gilbert
sometimes
went
on
a
velocipede
and
liked
it
but
did
not
possess
one
at
that
time
in
november
there
was
good
news
for
the
boys
richard
had
been
told
by
pelletier
that
a
post
at
marseilles
would
soon
be
vacant
and
that
he
might
apply
for
it
he
did
so
and
got
it
whilst
stephen
replaced
him
at
poitiers
so
that
now
they
were
both
provided
with
good
situations

hundred

at

i
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
a
page
of
with
end
written
upon
it
and
as
if
relieved
from
his
task
he
went
on
to
relate
the
following
incidents
there
has
been
a
curious
attempt
at
assassination
here
yesterday
a
doctor
named
vala
was
stopped
by
what
seemed
to
be
a
nun
who
asked
for
a
place
in
his
gig
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
a
parcel
belonging
to
the
nun
took
it
and
then
offered
her
his
hand
he
touched
it
thought
the
hand
of
a
man
whipped
his
horse
and
drove
off
at
full
speed
when
at
a
distance
he
examined
the
contents
of
the
parcel
which
turned
out
to
be
a
loaded
revolver
and
a
dagger
he
thinks
the
project
was
to
assassinate
him
other
curious
story
night
before
last
a
strange
man
got
tipsy
in
our
village
and
began
to
blab
and
talk
he
asked
for
a
bottle
without
a
bottom
and
for
some
woollen
rags
he
was
suspected
of
having
a
dynamite
project
and
the
mayor
was
fetched
at
one
in
the
morning
to
look
after
him
so
he
arrested
him
and
took
him
to
autun
at
two
on
the
way
the
man
coolly
confessed
that
he
was
one
of
a
dynamite
gang
of
ten
and
threatened
the
mayor
and
the
village
when
he
got
out
of
prison
so
you
see
we
have
our
dangers
as
well
as
you

more
popular

thousand

speak
well
for
your

here
as
yet
the
pirates
have
left
it
alone
although
the
life
has
been
pirated
still
the
author
continued
to
receive
many
letters
testifying
to
the
appreciation
of
the
book
by
his

have

henry

julia
cartwright
wrote
that
she
and
her
husband
had
been
charmed
with
it
the
book
seemed
to
have
influenced
women
powerfully
for
their
letters
about
it
were
very
numerous
the
news
of
richard
health
became
disquieting
early
in
the
month
of
january
he
suffered
much
from
headaches
and
could
not
work
he
was
well
nursed
at
his
uncle
pelletier
by
his
grandmother
who
happened
to
be
on
a
visit
to
her
the
doctor
said
it
was
a
kind
of
nondescript
fever
with
cerebral
and
typhoid
symptoms
to
which
young
people
not
acclimatized
to
marseilles
were
very
liable
on
settling
there
in
richard
case
there
had
been
a
predisposition
on
account
of
the
hard
work
he
had
gone
through
for
the
he
had
looked
as
if
he
bore
it
easily
while
it
lasted
but
the
strain
had
been
more
severe
than
he
was
aware
of
and
two
years
after
his
recovery
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
felt
the
same
since
that
illness
at
marseilles
in
february
miss
having
sent
a
volume
of
her
poems
to
my
husband
he
wrote
in
acknowledgment
i
have
read
your
book
in
the
evenings
and
with
pleasure
especially
some
pieces
that
i
have
read
many
times
wife
prayer
for

seems
to
me
quite
a
perfect
piece
of
work
and
not
less
perfect
in
another
way
and
quite
a
different
may
is
jose
mule
jacintha
the
delicate
humor
of
the
latter
in
combination
with
really
deep
pathos
and
most
finished
workmanship
please
me
immensely
besides
this
i
have
a
for
don
jos√©
because
i
have
an
old
pony
that
i
attend
to
myself
always
etc
i
have
been
vexed
for
some
time
now
by
the
tendency
to
jealous
hostility
between
france
and
england
i
had
hoped
some
years
ago
that
the
future
might
establish
a
friendly
understanding
between
the
two
nations
based
upon
their
obvious
interest
in
the
first
place
and
perhaps
a
little
on
the
interchange
of
ideas
but
i
fear
it
was
illusory
and
that
at
some
future
date
at
present
undeterminable
there
will
be
another
war
between
them
as
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
i
have
thought
sometimes
of
trying
to
found
an
society
or
league
the
members
of
which
should
simply
engage
themselves
to
do
their
best
on
all
occasions
to
soften
the
harsh
feeling
between
the
two
nations
i
dare
say
some
literary
people
would
join
such
a
league
swinburne
very
probably
would
and
so
would
you
i
fancy
i
could
get
adhesions
in
the
french
university
and
elsewhere
some
influential
political
englishmen
such
as
bright
might
be
counted
upon
i
would
have
begun
the
thing
long
since
but
i
dread
the
heavy
correspondence
it
would
bring
upon
me
i
would
have
a
very
small
subscription
as
the
league
ought
to
include
working
men
peace
and
war
hang
on
such
trifles
sometimes
that
a
society
such
as
i
am
imagining
might
possibly
on
some
occasion
have
influence
enough
to
prevent
a
war
it
should
be
understood
also
that
by
a
sort
of
freemasonry
a
member
of
the
society
would
endeavor
to
serve
any
member
of
it
belonging
to
the
other
nation
i
do
know
if
you
have
observed
how
harshly
matthew
arnold
writes
of
france
now
he
accuses
the
whole
nation
of
being
sunk
in
which
is
very
unfair
there
are
many
perfectly
people
in
france
and
why
does
not
arnold
write
in
the
same
strain
against
italy
which
is
more
immoral
still
the
french
expose
themselves
very
much
by
their
incapacity
for
hypocrisy
all
french
faults
are
the
winter
was
very
cold
and
all
the
ponds
were
covered
with
ice
affording
good
opportunity
for
skating
my

undertook
to
teach
mary
to
skate
and
they
often
went
on
the
ice
together
landscape
was
published
on
march
and
on
the
all
the
copies
were
gone
and
the
small
ones
dropping
off
daily
the
author
wrote
to
seeley
i
am
glad
is
moving
nicely
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
to
an
author
than
to
see
an
enterprising
publisher
paid
for
his
trust
and
confidence
by
anxiety
and
loss
especially
when
the
publisher
is
a
friend
failure
with
this
book
would
have
been
especially
painful
to
me
as
i
should
have
attributed
it
in
great
part
to
my
slowness
with
the
and
consequent
want
of
punctuality
stephens
said
the
book
is
a
superb
affair
and
as
far
as
i
have
seen
it
deserves
all
praise

partially
excusable
my

my

heavier
than
i
can
well

and
yet
stops
me
from

my
conscience
sometimes
perhaps
too
easily
stifled
but
still
for
my
time
of
life
and
the
public
manners
of
the
age
fairly
well
alive
forces
me
to
perpetual
and
almost
endless
transcriptions
on
the
back
of
all
this
any
correspondence
hangs
like
a
thundercloud
and
just
when
i
think
i
am
getting
through
my
troubles
crack
down
goes
my
health
i
have
a
long
costly
sickness
and
begin
the
world
again
it
is
fortunate
for
me
i
have
a
father
or
i
should
long
ago
have
died
but
the
opportunity
of
the
aid
makes
the
necessity
none
the
more
welcome
my
father
has
presented
me
with
a
beautiful
house
here
or
so
i
believe
for
i
have
not
yet
seen
it
being
a
cage
bird
but
for
nocturnal
sorties
in
the
garden
i
hope
we
shall
soon
move
into
it
and
i
tell
myself
that
some
day
perhaps
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
as
our
guest
i
trust
at
least
that
you
will
take
me
as
i
am
a
thoroughly
bad
correspondent
and
a
man
a
hater
indeed
of
rudeness
in
others
but
too
often
rude
in
all
unconsciousness
himself
and
that
you
will
never
cease
to
believe
the
sincere
sympathy
and
admiration
that
i
feel
for
you
and
for
your
work
about
the
which
i
had
a
glimpse
of
while
a
friend
of
mine
was
preparing
a
review
i
was
greatly
interested
and
could
write
and
wrangle
for
a
year
on
every
page
one
passage
particularly
delighted
me
the
part
about
ulysses
jolly
then
you
know
that
is
just
what
i
fear
i
have
come
to
think
landscape
ought
to
be
in
literature
so
there
we
should
be
at
odds
or
perhaps
not
so
much
as
i
suppose
as
montaigne
says
it
is
a
pot
with
two
handles
and
i
own
i
am
wedded
to
the
technical
handle
which
i
likewise
own
and
freely
you
do
well
to
keep
for
a
mistress
i
should
much
like
to
talk
with
you
about
some
other
points
it
is
only
in
talk
that
one
gets
to
understand
your
delightful
wordsworth
trap
i
have
tried
on
two
hardened
wordsworthians
not
that
i
am
not
one
myself
by
covering
up
the
context
and
asking
them
to
guess
what
the
passage
was
both
and
both
are
very
clever
people
one
a
writer
one
a
painter
pronounced
it
a
you
think
it
unusually
good
i
asked
and
both
said
not
at
all
their
grimace
was
a
picture
when
i
showed
the
original
i
trust
your
health
and
that
of
hamerton
keep
better
your
last
account
was
a
poor
one
i
was
unable
to
make
out
the
visit
i
had
hoped
as
i
do
not
know
if
you
heard
of
it
i
had
a
very
violent
and
dangerous
hemorrhage
last
spring
i
am
almost
glad
to
have
seen
death
so
close
with
all
my
wits
about
me
and
not
in
the
customary
lassitude
and
disenchantment
of
disease
even
thus
clearly
beheld
i
find
him
not
so
terrible
as
we
suppose
but
indeed
with
the
passing
of
years
the
decay
of
strength
the
loss
of
all
my
old
active
and
pleasant
habits
there
grows
more
and
more
upon
me
that
belief
in
the
kindness
of
this
scheme
of
things
and
the
goodness
of
our
veiled
god
which
is
an
excellent
and
pacifying
compensation
i
trust
if
your
health
continues
to
trouble
you
you
may
find
some
of
the
same
belief
but
perhaps
my
fine
discovery
is
a
piece
of
art
and
belongs
to
a
character
cowardly
intolerant
of
certain
feelings
and
apt
to
i
do
think
so
however
and
when
i
feel
what
a
weak
and
fallible
vessel
i
was
thrust
into
this
and
with
what
marvellous
kindness
the
wind
has
been
tempered
to
my
frailties
i
think
i
should
be
a
strange
kind
of
ass
to
feel
anything
but
gratitude
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
inflict
this
talk
upon
you
but
when
i
summon
the
rebellious

he
must
go

that
you
are
doing
in
art
what
he
is
doing
in
history
for
the
present
hamerton
had
no
great
work
in
hand
there
was
the
usual
writing
for
the
portfolio
and
he
had
been
asked
for
articles
by
the
editors
of
longmans
magazine
and
the
atlantic
monthly
but
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
as
to
the
subject
of
a
new
important
book
and
was
discussing
various
schemes
both
with
seeley
and
craik
in
one
of
his
letters
to
seeley
he
said
i
have
sometimes
thoughts
of
writing
a
book
not
too
long
on
the
elements
or
principles
of
art
criticism
in
the
same
way
as
lewes
once
wrote
a
series
of
papers
for
the
on
the
principles
of
success
in
literature
i
think
i
could
make
such
papers
interesting
by
giving
examples
both
from
critics
and
artists
and
from
various
kinds
of
art
it
would
add
to
the
interest
of
such
papers
if
they
had
a
few
illustrations
specially
for
themselves
and
as
i
went
on
with
the
writing
i
could
tell
you
beforehand
what
illustrations
might
be
useful
though
i
can
not
say
beforehand
what
might
be
required
i
should
make
it
my
business
to
show
in
what
real
criticism
that
is
worth
writing
and
worth
reading
differs
from
the
hasty
expression
of
mere
personal
sensations
which
is
so
often
substituted
for
it
and
i
would
show
in
some
detail
how
there
are
different
criteria
and
how
they
may
be
justly
or
unjustly
applied
giving
examples
the
articles
might
be
reprinted
afterwards
in
the
shape
of
a
book
like
my
of
turner
but
about
half
as
thick
and
if
we
kept
the
illustrations
small
they
might
go
into
the
book
such
a
piece
of
work
would
have
the
advantage
of
giving
me
opportunities
for
showing
how
strongly
tempted
we
all
are
to
judge
works
of
art
by
some
special
criterion
instead
of
applying
different
criteria
for
example
i
remember
hearing
a
man
say
before
a
picture
that
told
a
story
that
color
was
good
and
after
all
the
color
was
the
main
thing
in
a
picture
another
would
have
criticised
the
drawing
of
the
figures
a
third
the
composition
a
fourth
the
handling
lastly
it
might
have
occurred
to
some
one
to
inquire
how
the
story
was
told
and
whether
the
artist
had
understood
the
story
he
had
to
tell
i
remember
being
in
an
exhibition
with
robinson
the
famous
engraver
more
than
twenty
or
perhaps
thirty
years
ago
and
was
very
much
struck
by
a
criticism
of
his
on
a
picture
which
seemed
to
me
very
good
in
many
respects
though
the
effect
was
a
very
quiet
one
he
said
no
light
and
shade
and
the
want
of
good
strong
oppositions
of
light
and
dark
that
could
be
effectively
engraved
seemed
to
him
quite
a
fatal
defect
though
on
looking
at
the
work
in
color
the
absence
of
these
oppositions
did
not
strike
me
as
other
qualities
predominated
here
was
the
engraver
point
of
view
interfering
with
his
judgment
of
a
picture
that
was
good
but
could
not
be
engraved
effectually
then
we
have
the
interference
of
feelings
quite
outside
of
art
as
when
roman
catholics
tolerate
hideous
pictures
because
they
represent
some
saint
although
they
have
really
been
painted
from
a
hired
model
and
only
represent
a
saint
because
the
artist
with
a
view
to
sale
has
given
a
saint
name
to
the
portrait
of
the
model
also
there
is
the
judgment
by
the
literary
criterion
which
is
often
applied
to
pictures
by
thoughtful
and
learned
people
they
become
deeply
interested
in
one
picture
because
it
alludes
in
a
manner
which
seems
to
them
intelligent
to
something
they
know
by
books
and
they
pass
with
indifference
better
works
that
have
no
literary
association
then
you
have
the
judgment
of
pictures
which
goes
by
the
pleasure
of
the
eyes
and
tastes
a
picture
with
the
eyes
as
wine
and
good
cooking
are
tasted
by
the
tongue
i
believe
this
ocular
appreciation
is
nearer
to
the
essential
nature
of
art
than
the
literary
or
intellectual
appreciation
of
it
titian
pictures
which
never
have
anything
to
say
to
the
intellect
but
are
a
feast
to
the
eyes
then
you
have
the
criterion
which
judges
a
landscape
favorably
because
strata
are
correctly
superposed
their
dip
accurately
given
and
noticed
in
the
figure
this
criticism
relies
greatly
on
anatomy
i
have
jotted
down
these
paragraphs
roughly
merely
to
show
something
of
the
idea
but
of
course
in
the
work
itself
there
would
be
much
more
to
be
said
other
criteria
to
examine
and
a
fuller
inquiry
to
be
gone
into
about
these
i
should
rely
for
the
interest
of
the
papers
and
for
their
in
the
very
much
upon
the
examples
alluded
to
both
in
quotations
from
critics
and
in
references
to
works
of
art
with
regard
to
the
papers
on
landscape
painters
if
i
wrote
the
introductory
chapter
it
would
be
on
as
an
art
not
so
much
on
the
painters
i
should
trace
something
of
its
history
but
should
especially
show
how
it
differs
from
in
certain
conditions
for
example
in
composition
does
not
much
interfere
with
truthful
drawing
as
a
figure
can
always
be
made
to
conform
to
desired
shapes
by
simply
altering
its
attitude
and
putting
it
at
a
greater
or
less
distance
from
the
spectator
but
in
landscape
composition
always
involves
the
of
the
objects
themselves
again
color
is
of
much
more
sentimental
importance
in
landscape
than
in
the
figure
hills
a
streak
in
the
sky
and
water
produce
together
quite
a
strong
effect
on
the
poetical
imagination
whereas
the
same
colors
in
a
lady
dress
are
but
so
much
millinery
if
the
landscape
is
engraved
it
loses
of
its
poetical
significance
if
the
portrait
of
the
lady
is
engraved
there
is
only
a
sacrifice
of
some
colors
meanwhile
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
undertake
his
autobiography
and
stipulate
that
it
should
only
be
published
after
his
death
he
told
me
that
his
health
being
so
uncertain
and
his
earnings
so
precarious
he
had
thought
the
autobiography
might
be
a
resource
for
me
in
case
of
his
premature
decease
as
he
saw
clearly
that
notwithstanding
the
considerable
sums
which
his
recent
successes
had
brought
him
it
was
not
likely
that
he
should
ever
save
enough
to
leave
me
independent
as
he
had
himself
introduced
the
subject
i
led
him
to
consider
future
prospects
in
life
and
said
that
stephen
and
richard
being
now
provided
with
situations
we
ought
to
think
of
their
sister
her
musical
education
had
now
reached
such
a
point
that
no
teaching
afforded
by
autun
could
be
of
any
value
to
her
and
it
was
my
desire
that
she
might
have
the
advantage
of
instruction
and
direction
in
her
studies
from
one
of
the
best
professors
at
the
conservatoire
of
paris
i
realized
that
it
would
be
a
great
tax
and
a
no
less
great
sacrifice
for
my
husband
to
be
left
alone
while
i
should
be
in
paris
with
mary
but
i
also
knew
that
he
never
shrank
from
what
he
considered
a
duty
and
we
both
agreed
that
it
was
a
duty
to
put
our
daughter
in
a
position
to
earn
her
living
if
circumstances
made
it
necessary
accordingly
i
inquired
who
was
thought
to
be
the
best
executant
on
the
piano
in
paris
and
we
had
it
on
good
authority
that
it
was
delaborde
professor
at
the
conservatoire
with
whom
we
corresponded
immediately
although
we
had
friendly
recommendations
he
would
not
pledge
himself
to
anything
before
examining
mary
and
we
started
for
paris
in
some
uncertainty
i
had
engaged
a
little
apartment
at
the
h√¥tel
de
la
muette
where
we
were
known
and
a
pleasant
room
looking
on
the
garden
had
been
reserved
for
us
not
to
inconvenience
other
people
by
mary
practice
i
knew
the
result
of
the
examination
would
give
gilbert
great
pleasure
so
i
gave
him
every
detail
about
it
delaborde
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
extremely
severe
and
somewhat
blunt
was
most
kind
and
encouraging
after
making
mary
play
to
him
for
an
hour
he
said
that
will
do
there
remains
a
good
deal
to
be
done
and
acquired
but
you
acquire
it
by
hard
work
and
good
tuition
in
three
years
i
consent
to
take
you
as
one
of
my
pupils
but
i
must
let
you
know
at
once
that
i
am
very
exacting
do
be
afraid
of
me
for
i
see
that
you
are
industrious
and
that
you
really
music
and
now
i
am
going
to
pay
you
a
compliment
which
has
its
value
coming
from
me
i
find
no
defect
to
correct
in
your
method
after
that
he
gave
us
a
long
list
of
music
to
be
bought
for
practice
and
said
we
might
come
twice
a
week
he
also
inquired
what
direction
i
wished
her
studies
to
take
and
whether
she
intended
to
give
lessons
i
answered
that
i
wished
her
studies
to
be
of
the
most
serious
character
exactly
as
if
she
were
preparing
herself
to
be
a
though
it
was
not
her
parents
present
intention
but
because
one
never
was
certain
of
the
future
he
perfectly
understood
my
wishes
and
was
also
pleased
to
notice
his
new
pupil
partiality
for
classical
music
strange
to
say
and
i
did
not
fail
to
convey
the
important
fact
to
her
father
mary
who
was
so
easily
frightened
felt
perfectly
at
ease
with
delaborde
and
besides
her
sentiment
of
unbounded
admiration
for
his
talent
she
soon
came
to
have
a
great
liking
for
himself
her
father
was
very
glad
for
her
sake
especially
that
she
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
efforts
taken
and
appreciated
by
such
an
authority
as
delaborde
he
often
said
that
one
of
the
greatest
satisfactions
in
life
was
to
be
able
to
do
something
better
than
most
people
could
do
it
and
he
was
happy
in
the
thought
that
music
would
give
that
satisfaction
to
his
daughter
about
music
he
had
written
to
seeley
i
was
always
in
music
what
so
many
are
in
painting
simply
practical
in
my
youth
i
was
a
pupil
of
seymour
of
manchester
for
the
violin
and
thought
to
be
a
promising
amateur
but
i
have
played
far
more
music
than
i
ever
talked
about
i
do
at
all
know
how
to
talk
or
write
about
music
it
seems
to
me
that
it
expresses
and
that
nothing
else
can
express
it
after
an
absence
of
five
weeks
gilbert
was
very
glad
to
see
us
back
and
to
hear
that
delaborde
had
been
very
encouraging
to
mary
at
the
end
of
the
last
lesson
he
had
said
√†
prochaine
je
suis
certain
que
vous
reviendrez
vous
avez
le
feu
sacr√©
several
projects
of
books
had
occurred
to
hamerton
which
he
submitted
to
his
publishers
for
advice
he
had
thought
of
rouen
but
craik
had
answered
your
name
is
a
popular
one
and
anything
coming
from
you
is
pretty
sure
of
a
sale
but
we
should
consider
whether
even
your
name
will
persuade
the
public
to
buy
this
book
on
rouen
it
was
abandoned
for
the
consideration
of
a
work
on
the
western
islands
to
which
macmillan
were
favorable
seeley
was
suggesting
the
sea
as
a
subject
that
he
might
treat
with
authority
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
but
he
feared
he
had
not
had
sufficient
opportunity
of
studying
it
and
received
this
answer
your
letter
of
this
morning
has
suggested
to
me
another
scheme
a
series
of
articles
on
in
landscape
painting
the
idea
pleased
my
husband
very
much
and
as
he
reflected
about
it
he
began
a
sort
of
skeleton
scheme
for
its
treatment
his
own
imagination
about
landscape
was
truly
marvellous
since
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
power
to
travel
he
was
continually
dreaming
that
he
had
undertaken
long
and
distant
voyages
in
which
he
discovered
wondrously
beautiful
countries
and
magnificent
architecture
he
often
gave
me
on
awaking
vivid
descriptions
of
these
imaginary
scenes
which
he
remembered
in
every
detail
of
composition
effect
and
color
and
which
he
longed
though
hopelessly
to
reproduce
in
painting
he
was
now
writing
in
french
a
life
of
turner
for
the
series
of
les
artistes
c√©l√®bres
published
by
the
librairie
de
it
was
not
a
translation
from
his
english
life
of
turner
but
a
new
original
and
much
shorter
work
about
which
he
wrote
to
seeley
i
am
writing
a
book
in
french
a
new
life
of
turner
not
very
long
i
find
the
change
of
language
most
refreshing
composition
in
french
is
a
little
slower
for
me
but
not
much
and
as
i
am
a
great
appreciator
of
good
french
prose
it
is
fun
to
try
to
imitate
at
a
distance
some
of
its
qualities
years
after
writing
about
this
same
life
of
turner
he
said
to
seeley
the
insularity
of
the
english
that
you
speak
of
is
not
worse
than
the
insularity
of
the
french
when
i
wrote
my
of
turner
for
the
c√©l√®bres
series
i
was
asked
to
reduce
the
by
one
third
for
the
reason
that
the
thicker
numbers
were
only
given
to
great
artists
the
sale
was
very
moderate
as
so
few
french
people
care
anything
about
english
art
when
the
first
chapters
of
imagination
in
landscape
painting
reached
seeley
he
said
i
like
your
opening
chapters
much
and
i
feel
glad
that
i
have
set
you
on
a
good
subject
as
usual
during
the
vacation
my
husband
went
on
the
sa√¥ne
with
stephen
and
maurice
for
a
fortnight
had
been
greatly
improved
but
was
still
to
undergo
new
improvements
while
laid
up
for
the
winter
on
coming
back
home
gilbert
wrote
to
seeley
stephen
my
nephew
maurice
and
myself
have
just
returned
from
an
exhibition
on
the
sa√¥ne
in
my
boat
which
turned
out
delightful
we
had
considerable
variety
of
wind
and
weather
including
a
very
grand
thunderstorm
with
tremendous
wind
of
short
duration
we
were
just
near
enough
to
a
port
where
there
was
an
inn
to
be
able
to
take
refuge
in
time
the
boat
would
have
ridden
out
the
storm
on
the
water
scudding
under
bare
poles
of
course
but
i
have
seen
so
many
and
trees
struck
by
lightning
that
i
apprehended
the
possibility
of
its
striking
one
of
our
masts
at
the
inn
we
had
dinner
and
during
the
whole
of
dinner
between
five
and
six
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
mont
blanc
through
our
open
window
first
with
all
its
snows
rosy
and
afterwards
fading
into
gray
as
there
were
no
beds
in
the
inn
we
went
on
by
night
first
in
total
darkness
and
afterwards
in
moonlight
beating
against
the
wind
but
the
wind
falling
altogether
and
rain
coming
in
its
place
and
the
nearest
inn
being
twelve
kilom√®tres
away
we
slept
on
the
boat
under
a
tent
and
were
comfortable
enough
though
it
rained
all
night
next
morning
we
were
under
sail
at
seven
and
had
a
delightful
day
a
curious
thing
about
that
night
was
a
swarm
of
ephemerae
so
dense
that
it
was
like
a
blinding
snowstorm
i
could
hardly
see
to
steer
for
them
they
hit
my
face
like
pelting
rain
they
fell
on
the
deck
till
it
was
covered
an
inch
deep
and
two
inches
deep
in
parts
next
morning
stephen
on
cleaning
the
deck
rolled
them
up
into
large
balls
which
he
threw
into
the
river
the
people
call
them
we
exercised
ourselves
in
all
ways
going
out
for
manoeuvers
against
the
wind
when
it
was
worst
rowing
in
dead
calms
or
towing
the
boat
from
the
shore
as
there
is
a
all
along
one
side
so
we
need
never
be
quite
stopped
the
boat
behaved
capitally
and
as
the
lads
became
better
drilled
they
did
the
sailing
business
better
together
my
health
kept
wonderfully
well
in
spite
of
or
perhaps
in
consequence
of
a
good
deal
of
work
and
some
hardship
i
did
a
lot
of
sketches
and
amused
myself
particularly
with
drawing
the
delicate
distances
yesterday
on
our
return
we
met
by
appointment
a
picnic
party
at
n√¥rlay
and
walked
ten
kilom√®tres
under
drenching
rain
to
see
a
natural
curiosity
called
the
of
the
world
where
limestone
cliffs
end
in
a
sort
of
it
is
believed
to
be
a
creek
of
an
ancient
lake
or
sea
the
cliffs
are
evidently
undermined
by
waves
and
hang
over
the
ground
in
the
middle
is
full
of
beautiful
pastures
and
vineyards
with
lovely
groups
of
trees
and
a
stream
and
two
very
picturesque
villages
the
different
methods
which
had
been
tried
for
producing
manuscript
in
duplicate
had
all
proved
distasteful
and
unsatisfactory
my
husband
was
particularly
irritated
by
the
delay
caused
by
having
to
press
down
the
hard
or
stiletto
he
could
not
bear
any
slow
process
for
expressing
the
swiftly
running
thoughts
and
he
tried
another
plan
which
enabled
him
to
write
very
nearly
as
fast
as
the
ideas
came
using
glazed
paper
and
a
soft
pencil
he
made
a
rough
draft
without
attempt
at
polish
in
style
merely
fixing
the
thoughts
this
he
corrected
at
leisure
and
copied
with
a
particular
kind
of
ink
which
was
said
to
yield
copies
upon
moist
paper
put
under
a
but
the
result
was
very
imperfect
and
took
too
much
time
and
finally
he
used
to
have
his
corrected
copied
by
a
professional
typewriter
this
plan
was
by
far
the
most
satisfactory
as
by
relieving
him
from
the
drudgery
of
copying
it
allowed
more
time
for
painting
and
a
rather
important
picture
of
kilchurn
castle
was
begun
to
be
hung
on
the
staircase
in
february
french
and
english
was
begun
my
husband
was
particularly
qualified
to
give
an
impartial
comparison
of
the
habits
institutions
and
characteristics
of
the
two
nations
on
account
of
his
sympathies
with
both
and
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
french
language
and
long
residence
in
france
during
which
his
inquisitive
mind
had
been
gathering
endless
information
about
the
public
institutions
of
the
country
he
had
made
himself
perfectly
acquainted
with
french
politics
and
followed
with
great
interest
all
current
events
the
system
of
public
instruction
in
france
had
become
familiar
to
him
through
pelletier
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
university
from
his
youth
and
he
had
not
neglected
to
learn
from
the
several
ecclesiastics
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
what
he
wanted
to
know
about
the
constitution
of
the
roman
catholic
church
and
clergy
in
the
same
way
his
military
friends
told
him
what
he
cared
to
learn
of
the
army
he
had
for
a
neighbor
de
chatillon
cousin
of
the
poet
and
painter
de
chatillon
a
retired
captain
who
had
been
in
the
crimea
and
was
wounded
in
the
war
also
a
friend
and
visitor
another
captain
kornprobst
with
whom
he
made
the
voyage
on
the
sa√¥ne
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
quartered
at
autun
mathieu
who
had
fought
by
the
side
of
the
english
in
the
crimea
came
sometimes
too
to
talk
about
past
days
and
recalled
among
other
things
with
gratitude
and
admiration
the
fare
of
which
he
had
partaken
on
board
an
english
hamerton
had
only
to
put
questions
to
one
of
these
officers
to
obtain
full
information
upon
any
point
of
french
military
organization
as
regards
national
characteristics
in
individuals
he
had
a
rich
accumulation
of
notes
and
observations
both
in
his
and
in
his
mind
very
observant
from
early
youth
this
tendency
had
been
quickened
by
the
contrasts
that
life
in
foreign
parts
constantly
presented
it
had
been
decided
that
the
rhone
voyage
should
be
abandoned
for
one
on
the
sa√¥ne
and
hamerton
was
in
active
correspondence
with
seeley
about
the
choice
of
an
artist
to
illustrate
the
book
both
of
them
were
great
admirers
of
pennell
talent
and
they
agreed
to
make
him
a
proposal
pennell
having
been
overworked
and
feeling
rather
nervous
and
unwell
thought
that
the
contemplated
voyage
would
be
the
very
thing
to
restore
his
health
he
would
have
perfect
tranquillity
on
the
peaceful
river
and
he
might
sketch
at
his
leisure
without
hurry
so
he
gladly
accepted
the
hospitality
offered
him
on
board
the
boussemroum
the
plan
of
accommodation
on
this
boat
has
been
explained
exhaustively
by
the
author
of
the
sa√¥ne
but
i
think
i
may
give
a
few
brief
indications
of
the
arrangements
for
readers
unacquainted
with
the
book
hamerton
hired
a
large
called
the
boussemroum
and
two
men
to
manage
it
and
do
the
cooking
a
donkey
zoulou
was
kept
on
board
to
tow
the
boat
when
necessary
and
in
the
course
of
the
voyage
a
boy
franki
was
engaged
to
drive
zoulou
three
tents
had
been
erected
for
the
passengers
and
an
awning
was
placed
over
part
of
a
raised
platform
to
shelter
the
artists
at
work
from
the
too
generous
heat
of
the
june
sunshine
each
tent
was
furnished
as
a
simple
bedroom
with
an
iron
bedstead
and
a
hammock
washing
utensils
chest
table
for
drawing
or
writing
and
mats
on
the
floor
besides
pennell
tent
and
hamerton
another
had
been
reserved
for
captain
kornprobst
who
was
to
undertake
the
duties
of
the
commissariat
there
was
nothing
so
difficult
for
my
husband
as
to
turn
his
mind
from
intellectual
or
artistic
thoughts
to
domestic
or
business
affairs
he
was
aware
of
it
and
dreaded
interruptions
and
the
fear
of
interruptions
as
well
as
the
responsibility
of
keeping
his
floating
home
so
regularly
provisioned
as
to
save
its
inmates
from
becoming
occasionally
a
prey
to
hunger
or
thirst
humbly
confessing
his
shortcomings
he
begged
his
friend
captain
kornprobst
to
join
the
expedition
as
purser
and
general
provider
feeling
confident
that
if
he
consented
everything
would
it
was
an
immense
relief
when
the
captain
declared
himself
ready
and
willing
to
assume
these
functions
pennell
having
been
suddenly
obliged
to
go
to
antwerp
for
a
series
of
drawings
could
not
be
free
at
the
time
of
starting
on
the
other
hand
captain
kornprobst
had
been
summoned
the
boat
hired
and
the
men
wages
were
running
so
the
voyage
was
begun
on
the
understanding
that
pennell
would
join
the
party
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
antwerp
probably
at
corre
on
the
upper
sa√¥ne
on
arriving
at
on
may
hamerton
was
met
by
the
captain
and
they
proceeded
at
once
to
the
boussemroum
which
they
put
in
order
as
it
moved
away
it
was
only
at
gray
on
june
that
pennell
came
on
board
it
has
been
said
in
some
notices
of
hamerton
life
that
he
read
but
little
nothing
could
be
more
opposed
to
truth
the
fact
is
that
he
was
constantly
attempting
to
bind
himself
by
rules
to
give
only
a
certain
proportion
of
his
time
to
reading
and
when
he
travelled
he
was
sure
to
have
among
his
luggage
a
large
trunk
of
books
here
is
a
list
for
instance
of
the
works
he
took

him

the
adventures
of
the
voyage
having
been
narrated
in
the
sa√¥ne
i
shall
only
mention
the
incident
of
the
arrest
because
it
turned
out
to
be
a
lucky
thing
that
i
just
then
happened
to
be
in
paris
it
must
be
explained
that
pelletier
having
been
entrusted
with
the
organization
of
one
of
the
great
new
lyc√©es
the
lyc√©e
lakanal
at
sceaux
had
been
deprived
of
his
usual
vacation
in
and
as
a
little
compensation
he
came
to
spend
the
easter
of
with
us
and
took
away
mary
who
was
to
stay
with
him
for
her
yearly
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
took
advantage
of
my
husband
absence
to
go
and
see
the
paris
salon
and
to
bring
back
our
daughter
on
june
while
we
were
at
lunch
with
pelletier
and
his
children
and
making
merry
guesses
as
to
the
probable
whereabouts
of
the
voyagers
on
the
sa√¥ne
there
came
a
telegram
for
my
who
said
to
me
after
reading
it
what
would
you
say
if
they
were
arrested
as
spies
we
all
laughed
at
the
idea
and
i
answered
that
it
would
be
capital
material
for
a
chapter
well
then
since
you
take
it
this
way
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
it
is
a
fact
though
your
husband
wishes
it
to
be
kept
from
you
till
he
is
released
i
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
imprisoned
and
that
his
nervousness
would
return
in
confinement
from
this
point
of
view
the
consequences
seemed
alarming
and
i
wondered
what
would
be
the
best
plan
to
set
him
free
as
soon
as
possible
my
was
for
applying
to
the
english
ambassador
but
i
felt
pretty
sure
that
my
husband
would
write
to
him
and
that
negotiations
in
that
quarter
would
take
some
time
so
i
went
straight
to
one
of
our
friends
who
had
a
near
relation
holding
an
important
military
post
at
the
√©lys√©e
and
who
might
be
of
great
help
on
this
occasion
i
told
my
friend
what
had
happened
and
he
promised
to
go
and
explain
matters
to
his
relative
and
to
obtain
speedily
an
order
of
release
for
the
unlucky
travellers
the
same
evening
i
had
a
note
to
the
effect
that
the
minister
of
war
had
sent
the
desired
order
by
telegram
the
author
of
the
sa√¥ne
has
explained
why
the
voyage
was
interrupted
at
chalon
the
second
part
was
to
be
made
on
the
arar
and
the
erections
on
the
boussemroum
were
to
be
demolished
and
the
tents
removed
before
the
boat
was
returned
to
its
owner
but
as
mary
and
i
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
it
before
the
demolition
we
went
to
chalon
where
my
husband
took
us
on
board
and
explained
all
the
contrivances
which
were
very
ingenious
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
the
boussemroum
with
its
three
large
tents
attracted
quite
a
crowd
on
the
quay
where
it
was
moored
and
as
we
made
our
way
towards
it
we
were
followed
by
many
curious
eyes
pennell
having
been
discouraged
and
disheartened
by
the
loss
of
time
and
the
insecurity
of
his
situation
in
france
especially
since
he
had
failed
to
get
an
official
permission
to
sketch
at
lyons
gave
up
all
idea
of
illustrating
the
lower
sa√¥ne
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
book
could
it
be
published
in
an
incomplete
state
and
called
the
upper
sa√¥ne
in
that
case
the
work
would
be
of
small
importance
after
all
the
preparations
time
and
money
spent
upon
it
would
it
not
be
better
to
ask
another
artist
to
undertake
the
remaining
part
asked
seeley
but
he
would
have
to
encounter
the
same
difficulties
and
be
exposed
to
the
same
vexations
and
after
all
the
book
might
be
wanting
in
harmony
at
last
pennell
offered
to
make
drawings
from
the
author
sketches
and
this
was
accepted
my
husband
had
already
in
his
possession
a
great
number
of
studies
taken
at
chalon
m√¢con
and
upon
the
river
on
previous
cruises
and
they
might
be
utilized
in
this
way
together
with
those
he
could
still
make
during
the
vacation
on
the
arar
in
the
interval
between
the
two
boat
voyages
hamerton
devoted
himself
almost
exclusively
to
writing
french
and
english
for
the
atlantic
monthly
and
the
sa√¥ne
he
also
took
some
precautions
in
view
of
the
next
cruise
and
when
he
started
for
it
with
stephen
and
maurice
he
was
provided
with
a
passport
and
a
recommendation
from
the
english
ambassador
the
voyage
was
a
pleasant
one
and
ended
prosperously
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
book
could
not
be
published
before
the
next
year
mainly
because
the
stereotype
plates
could
not
have
reached
america
before
december
and
the
publishers
then
would
still
have
to
print
and
bind
the
book
roberts
brothers
said
about
it
we
are
very
glad
you
have
decided
to
postpone
the
publication
of
the
boat
voyage
till
next
year
you
will
see
by
our
account
that
we
allow
you
nothing
on
the
cheap
edition
of
the
life
thank
the
pirates
for
it
hamerton
mediocrity
has
passed
through
a
second
edition
the
first
was
copies
this
last
book
was
a
novelette
that
i
had
written
at
the
instigation
of
roberts
brothers
and
which
had
been
corrected
by
my
husband
the
illustrations
needed
for
the
completion
of
the
sa√¥ne
took
a
great
deal
of
hamerton
time
in
early
in
january
he
went
to
chalon
to
take
several
sketches
which
he
worked
out
afterwards
in
we
took
the
opportunity
of
this
journey
to
see
a
few
houses
which
had
been
recommended
to
us
as
possible
future
residences
la
tuilerie
requiring
expensive
repairs
that
we
were
not
inclined
to
undertake
because
every
time
we
made
any
our
rent
was
raised
no
doubt
because
it
was
thought
that
just
after
a
fresh
outlay
we
should
not
be
disposed
to
leave
but
we
found
the
much
higher
about
chalon
than
in
our
neighborhood
and
although
gilbert
was
fond
of
the
sa√¥ne
particularly
for
boating
he
was
far
from
admiring
the
landscape
as
much
as
that
of
the
autunois
from
a
painter
point
of
view
after
much
consideration
we
decided
to
go
through
the
unavoidable
repairs
and
to
renew
our
lease
i
suppose
that
the
sa√¥ne
voyage
had
directed
my
husband
thoughts
towards
boats
more
than
ever
for
his
diary
is
full
of
notes
about
them
i
shall
only
give
a
few
to
show
the
drift
of
his
mind
made
a
sketch
for
a
possible
triple
catamaran
made
an
elevation
of
hull
for
the
using
an
elevation
of
a
quickly
turning
steamer
in
yacht
and
upon
it
made
a
new
balancer
for
canoe
began
to
prepare
pirogue
with
marine
glue
before
putting
the
lengthened
completed
beam
for
catamaran
adding
details
of
ironwork
demolished
old
balancer
log
of
canoe
and
began
to
saw
it
to
make
a
little
bridge
found
that
boiling
wood
was
the
best
plan
for
bending
it
steaming
is
too
troublesome
thought
much
about
sails
wrote
a
letter
to
about
invention
of
in
october
he
began
to
write
for
le
yacht
a
history
of
catamarans
which
was
highly
appreciated
by
the
readers
of
that
paper
in
the
course
of
that
year
he
also
wrote
a
long
and
careful
review
of
for
longmans
magazine
conversations
on
book
illustrations
and
a
review
of
ernest
george
etchings
he
also
worked
at
the
autobiography
it
was
a
real
sorrow
for
my
husband
to
hear
that
in
consequence
of
the
demise
of
john
hamerton
hellifield
peel
and
the
estate
were
for
sale
and
likely
to
go
out
of
the
family
he
had
been
considerately
offered
the
first
option
of
purchase
and
he
wrote
in
the
diary
how
i
wish
i
had
the
money
in
january
he
wrote
to
seeley
we
are
rather
troubled
by
the
possibility
of
a
war
between
france
and
germany
the
french
papers
take
the
thing
coolly
but
the
english
ones
especially
the
news
are
extremely
pessimist
if
there
is
war
i
mean
to
come
to
england
having
had
enough
anxiety
and
interrupted
communications
during
the
last
war
my
sons
would
probably
both
volunteer
into
the
french
army
in
defence
of
their
mother
country
as
it
would
be
a
duel
of
life
and
death
between
germany
and
france
this
time
if
you
and
seeley
visit
the
continent
in
the
spring
you
may
perhaps
witness
a
battle
i
have
seen
just
one
and
heard
the
cannonade
of
another
sensations
never
to
be
forgotten
in
the
spring
he
had
had
an
attack
of
gout
in
consequence
of
working
at
the
boats
instead
of
going
out
he
bore
it
with
his
usual
philosophy
trying
to
read
or
write
whenever
the
pain
was
supportable
it
happened
during
the
easter
vacation
and
stephen
used
to
sit
up
late
into
the
night
to
keep
his
father
company
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
richard
who
had
obtained
a
post
in
paris
took
his
sister
with
him
and
in
june
gilbert
being
now
quite
well
i
went
to
fetch
her
back
delaborde
had
recommended
her
the
study
of
harmony
and
we
found
an
able
professor
in
laurent
the
organist
of
the
cathedral
at
autun
it
was
with
great
satisfaction
that
her
father
noticed
her
application
and
success
in
this
arduous
study
he
considered
it
like
algebra
an
excellent
discipline
for
the
mind
too
often
wanting
in
a
feminine
education
against
all
expectations
the
sa√¥ne
did
not
sell
well
it
was
unaccountable
the
illustrations
were
numerous
and
varied
picturesque
and
greatly
admired
by
artists
rajon
in
particular
was
charmed
with
them
but
it
appears
that
their
sin
consisted
in
not
being
etchings
so
at
least
said
the
booksellers
as
if
the
author
works
were
never
to
be
illustrated
in
any
other
way
the
subject
was
new
and
presented
in
felicitous
style
the
reviews
were
hearty
but
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
said
in
its
favor
the
book
never
became
a
popular
one
seeley
had
mentioned
in
a
letter
the
uncertainty
of
the
publishing
business
and
my
husband
answered
what
you
say
about
the
lottery
of
publishing
is
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
others
macmillan
said
to
me
one
day
one
gets
older
and
certainly
more
experienced
one
ought
to
get
wiser
but
it
does
not
seem
to
be
so
in
publishing
for
i
am
just
as
liable
to
error
now
in
my
speculations
as
i
was
many
years
ago
evidently
roberts
brothers
are
the
same
the
subject
of
french
and
english
seemed
too
important
to
hamerton
to
be
adequately
treated
in
a
few
articles
and
he
decided
to
give
it
proper
development
in
a
book
for
which
all
his
accumulated
observations
would
become
useful
he
proposed
it
to
macmillan
warning
them
that
as
he
intended
to
be
impartial
they
might
find
that
his
opinions
conscientiously
given
would
often
be
at
variance
with
those
generally
accepted
craik
answered
as
to
and
english
i
do
not
think
that
it
matters
in
the
least
that
you
differ
from
the
opinions
of
others
then
he
went
on
to
say
i
hope
to
hear
from
you
about
a
large
illustrated
book
for
and
we
will
gladly
go
into
the
matter
with
you
when
you
have
got
an
idea
into
your
head
in
the
autumn
we
learned
with
deep
regret
the
death
of
our
dear
cousin
ben
hinde
my
husband
conveyed
it
to
his
friend
schmitt
in
the
following
letter

time
later
he
wrote
to
the

r√©ellement

le
seul
qui
me
fasse
du

note
in
the
diary
january
fought
nearly
all
day
against
a
difficulty
about
and
english
and
decided
to
divide
the
book
into
large
sections
and
small
chapters
divisions
and
subdivisions
chapters
to
be
confined
strictly
to
their
special
subjects
it
became
the
main
work
of
the
year
with
the
articles
on
catamarans
for
the
yacht
and
the
numerous
drawings
to
illustrate
them
the
autobiography
was
also
carried
forward
our
little
pony
cocote
was
growing
old
and
rheumatic
and
could
no
longer
render
much
service
my
husband
was
unwilling
to
make
her
work
at
the
cost
of
pain
and
we
found
it
impossible
to
do
without
a
reliable
horse
at
such
a
distance
from
autun
as
cocote
was
not
always
unfit
for
work
only
at
intervals
her
master
decided
to
buy
a
horse
that
he
might
ride
when
the
pony
could
manage
the
carriage
work
he
chose
a
young
mare
at
a
neighboring
farm
and
took
great
pleasure
in
riding
her
every
day
this
regular
habit
of
exercise
in
the
open
air
was
of
great
benefit
to
his
health
the
death
of
paul
rajon
which
occurred
in
the
summer
was
deeply
lamented
by
my
husband
who
besides
his
great
appreciation
of
the
artist
exquisite
talent
entertained
for
him
sentiments
of
real
friendship
when
we
came
to
live
at
paris
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
his
house
and
to
his
alas
neglected
tomb
at
auvers
in
august
seeley
wished
to
republish
in
book
form
some
of
hamerton
contributions
to
the
portfolio
and
to
give
his
portrait
as
a
frontispiece
he
wrote
about
it
my
traveller
says
he
is
continually
asked
for
your
portrait
if
jeens
were
living
i
would
ask
him
to
engrave
it
but
as
we
have
no
one
approaching
him
in
skill
perhaps
the
safest
plan
would
be
a
photogravure
from
a
negative
taken
on
purpose
my
husband
suggested
that
perhaps
manesse
might
etch
the
portrait
satisfactorily
seeley
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
and
said
he
was
willing
to
give
the
commission
manesse
arrived
on
october
and
set
to
work
immediately
he
was
most
assiduous
and
progressed
happily
with
his
work
his
model
drove
him
out
every
day
the
weather
being
fine
and
they
derived
pleasure
from
each
other
society
being
both
interested
in
the
beauty
of
nature
and
in
artistic
subjects

mr
t
mr
bodley
french
and
english
after
long
reflections
given
to
the
choice
of
a
subject
for
a
new
illustrated
book
hamerton
thought
that
after
landscape
in
art
man
in
art
would
be
interesting
as
a
study
craik
wrote
in
art
is
an
excellent
idea
you
will
find
us
ready
to
embark
on
it
with
sanguine
expectation
you
will
later
tell
me
your
ideas
of
illustrating
it
ought
to
be
well
done
in
this
particular
but
if
there
is
a
chance
of
your
coming
to
england
next
winter
we
might
settle
this
better
in
talk
in
the
spring
stephen
and
richard
came
as
usual
for
the
easter
vacation
but
our
younger
son
altered
looks
and
ways
greatly
disquieted
us
in
the
last
year
he
had
evinced
a
growing
disinclination
to
society
and
pleasure
his
former
liveliness
gayety
and
love
of
jokes
had
been
replaced
by
an
obvious
preference
for
solitude
and
as
it
seemed
to
us
melancholy
brooding
to
our
anxious
inquiries
he
had
answered
that
he
was
nervous
and
suffering
from
mental
unrest
and
insomnia
his
tone
of
voice
was
now
despondent
and
if
he
spoke
of
the
future
it
was
with
bitterness
and
lassitude
he
had
been
so
bright
so
confident
in
his
powers
so
full
of
praiseworthy
ambition
so
ready
to
enjoy
life
that
this
sudden
change
surprised
all
his
friends
and
gave
great
anxiety
to
his
parents
i
begged
his
father
to
question
him
about
his
health
and
to
advise
him
to
get
a
which
he
could
spend
in
the
country
with
us
and
during
which
he
might
rest
thoroughly
but
i
was
told
that
he
had
not
borne
the
questioning
patiently
he
had
answered
that
he
was
only
nervous
very
nervous
and
wanted
peace
how
different
was
this
answer
from
the
one
he
had
given
three
years
before
to
another
inquiry
of
his
father
when
he
was
going
to
his
first
post
richard
i
can
give
you
no
fortune
to
start
you
in
life
education
was
all
i
could
afford
so
you
will
have
to
make
your
own
way
you
are
now
strong
and
well
but
you
have
been
a
delicate
child
and
have
often
suffered
physically
now
considering
all
this
are
you
happy
happy
he
had
readily
answered
i
am
very
happy
i
enjoy
life
exceedingly
as
to
money
matters
i
can
truly
say
that
i
would
not
exchange
the
education
you
have
given
me
for
three
thousand
pounds
my
husband
attempted
to
calm
my
sad
forebodings
by
telling
me
that
there
is
generally
a
crisis
in
the
life
of
a
boy
before
he
becomes
a
man
and
he
concluded
persuasively
by
saying
un
homme
qui
va
sortir
de
l√†
but
i
felt
that
his
own
mind
was
still
full
of
care
when
the
time
of
my
yearly
departure
for
paris
came
round
i
recommended
gilbert
to
hire
a
tricycle
and
try
to
get
a
change
of
exercise
by
alternately
riding
his
horse
and
his
velocipede
and
he
promised
to
do
so
for
some
time
i
had
been
desirous
to
join
mary
on
account
of
her
confidences
about
the
probability
of
her
becoming
engaged
of
these
confidences
i
said
nothing
to
her
father
as
i
had
made
it
a
rule
not
to
disturb
him
about
any
projects
of
marriage
for
his
daughter
till
i
felt
satisfied
that
everything
was
suitable
and
likely
to
lead
to
a
happy
result
his
love
for
mary
was
so
tender
his
fears
of
any
match
which
would
not
secure
for
her
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
happiness
so
great
his
dread
of
the
unavoidable
separation
so
keen
that
i
avoided
the
subject
as
much
as
possible
when
i
arrived
at
i
was
disappointed
not
to
see
richard
at
the
station
with
his
sister
and
cousins
awaiting
me
as
he
had
done
the
year
before
but
i
tried
not
to
seem
to
notice
it
he
came
however
on
the
following
day
and
breakfasted
with
us
at
his
uncle
he
appeared
cheerful
enough
when
he
talked
but
as
soon
as
he
was
silent
his
features
resumed
the
downcast
expression
they
had
worn
for
some
time
and
he
was
ashy
pale
being
obliged
to
take
mary
to
her
last
i
asked
richard
when
i
should
see
him
again
he
gave
me
a
kiss
and
said
there
was
to
be
no
morrow
for
him
when
after
vainly
waiting
for
him
the
cruel
news
of
his
tragic
end
was
broken
to
us
by
pelletier
when
we
learned
that
the
poor
boy
had
committed
suicide
my
sorrow
was
rendered
almost
unbearable
by
apprehension
for
my
husband
i
had
long
feared
that
there
might
be
something
wrong
with
his
heart
and
now
i
became
a
prey
to
the
most
torturing
forebodings
my
daughter
and
shared
in
them
and
pelletier
approved
my
resolution
to
leave
paris
immediately
and
endeavor
to
be
with
gilbert
before
the
delivery
of
the
newspapers
mary
and
i
left
by
the
first
train
we
could
take
and
arrived
at
la
tuilerie
shortly
before
eleven
at
night
my
husband
divined
at
once
that
there
was
some
great
calamity
but
his
fears
were
for
pelletier
when
he
knew
the
truth
he
silently
wrapped
me
in
his
arms
pressing
me
to
his
bosom
within
which
i
felt
the
laboring
heart
beating
with
such
violence
that
i
thought
it
could
but
break
the
courage
of
which
my
husband
gave
proofs
in
this
bitter
trial
was
mainly
derived
from
his
pitiful
sympathy
for
those
whose
weakness
he
supported
he
sought
relief
in
work
but
did
not
easily
find
it
there
is
the
same
plaintive
entry
in
the
diary
for
some
weeks
tried
to
work
not
fit
for
it
tried
to
do
something
not
very
well
not
fit
for
much
succeeded
in
reading
a
little
attempted
to
write
a
few
letters
rather
unwell
then
he
gave
up
the
diary
for
some
time
more
than
ever
i
felt
reluctant
to
tell
him
of
what
had
happened
to
mary
and
of
the
probability
of
her
marriage
however
she
had
been
so
sorely
tried
by
the
loss
of
her
brother
that
it
was
imperative
to
turn
her
thoughts
from
it
as
much
as
possible
to
other
prospects
this
conviction
decided
me
to
tell
her
father
everything
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
hear
that
he
shared
my
views
entirely
although
i
had
learned
long
since
how
little
he
considered
his
own
comfort
in
comparison
with
that
of
those
dear
to
him
how
unselfish
he
was
in
affection
as
in
other
matters
i
must
avow
that
i
was
unprepared
for
the
readiness
of
his
in
this
case
we
were
both
of
opinion
that
if
all
went
well
the
marriage
should
take
place
as
early
as
possible
so
as
to
bring
a
thorough
change
in
the
clouded
existence
of
our
daughter
note
in
the
diary
monsieur
raillard
this
morning
asked
mary
to
marry
him
with
my
consent
and
she
accepted
him
day
passed
pleasantly
i
drove
raillard
and
his
mother
to
the
station
it
now
became
necessary
to
make
preparations
for
the
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
beginning
of
september
for
the
choice
of
an
apartment
and
its
furniture
my
husband
himself
considerately
suggested
my
going
again
to
paris
with
mary
where
we
would
meet
raillard
and
consult
his
tastes
accordingly
i
left
la
tuilerie
very
reluctantly
after
the
great
and
recent
shock
my
husband
had
experienced
i
am
convinced
it
was
due
to
the
manful
effort
he
made
not
to
increase
my
distress
by
the
sight
of
his
own
that
he
conquered
his
nervousness
from
that
time
and
was
even
able
to
strengthen
and
support
me
on
my
too
frequent
breakdowns
he
attributed
richard
desperate
action
partly
to
depression
arising
from
the
effects
of
an
accident
confided
only
to
his
brother
but
partly
also
to
the
influence
of
unhealthy
and
pessimist
literature
on
a
mind
already
diseased
and
he
had
said
so
to
seeley
who
answered
i
am
sure
that
poor
richard
came
under
the
influence
of
pure
and
noble
examples
it
may
be
that
there
was
actual
brain
disease
though
of
a
nature
that
no
surgeon
at
present
has
skill
to
detect
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
disease
in
the
organ
of
thought
may
be
accelerated
or
retarded
by
the
nature
of
the
thoughts
suggested
in
daily
life
or
conversation
and
i
suppose
every
one
believes
that
in
such
disorders
there
may
come
a
time
when
the
will
without
blame
is
overmastered
as
to
the
bad
literature
of
the
day
i
believe
our
feelings
are
quite
in
unison
what
an
awful
responsibility
for
the
happiness
of
families
rests
upon
successful
authors
and
upon
publishers
too
the
letters
of
condolence
and
sympathy
were
numerous
and
heartfelt
some
came
late
for
the
friends
who
had
known
richard
in
his
bright
and
merry
days
refused
to
believe
that
it
was
the
same
richard
who
had
come
to
so
tragic
an
end
they
thought
it
was
a
coincidence
of
name
i
only
give
beljame
letter
to
show
how
the
poor

had
endeared
himself
to
every

in
what

he
was
generally
held

madame

de
sa
triste
et
respectueuse
sympathie
a
beljame
when
seeley
was
told
of
mary
engagement
he
wrote
we
are
very
glad
to
hear
of
mary
engagement
and
we
wish
her
all
possible
happiness
but
because
you
and
i
are
so
nearly
of
an
age
i
can
not
help
thinking
most
of
you
and
thinking
what
the
loss
to
you
and
to
hamerton
will
be
in
preceding
years
mary
brothers
and
cousins
had
often
made
projects
in
expectation
of
her
marriage
but
under
the
present
painful
circumstances
it
was
understood
that
only
relations
would
he
invited
still
the
disturbance
in
our
habits
could
not
be
avoided
as
we
had
to
provide
lodgings
for
twenty
people
my
husband
gave
up
his
laboratory
and
his
studio
and
with
the
help
of
the
boys
transformed
the
into
working
premises
he
got
carpenters
to
fit
up
the
big
laundry
as
a
under
his
directions
and
when
mats
covered
the
tiles
and
when
the
huge
the
walls
and
the
doors
were
ornamented
with
tall
ferns
shiny
hollies
and
blooming
heather
of
which
stephen
and
his
cousins
had
gathered
a
cartful
the
effect
was
very
charming
my
husband
had
to
be
reminded
several
times
to
order
new
clothes
for
the
ceremony
a
visit
to
his
tailor
being
one
of
the
things
he
most
disliked
and
being
indisposed
to
give
a
thought
to
the
fit
he
used
to
decline
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
by
making
a
judge
of
it
his
fancy
had
been
once
tickled
by
hearing
a
say
that
though
she
did
not
know
my
name
she
identified
me
as
la
petite
dame
difficile
and
he
called
me
so
when
i
found
fault
with
his
attire
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
he
had
gone
to
autun
to
fetch
different
things
in
the
carriage
among
them
his
and
and
after
putting
on
the
last
came
for
my
verdict
it
fits
badly
it
is
far
too
large
then
i
was
interrupted
by
i
was
sure
of
it
now
is
wrong
with
it
wrong
why
everything
is
wrong
the
cloth
itself
is
not
black
it
looks
faded
and
rusty
why
it
ca
be
new
not
new
and
i
bring
it
straight
from
the
tailor
really
your
inclination
to
criticism
is
beyond
he
was
getting
somewhat
impatient
for
the
time
given
to
trying
on
was
in
his
estimate
so
much
time
lost
it
an
old
coat
i
nevertheless
said
decisively
your
tailor
has
made
a
mistake
that
all
i
am
certain
it
is
coat
he
answered
quite
angrily
this
time
i
feel
at
ease
in
it
the
pockets
are
just
in
their
right
place
and
as
he
plunged
his
hands
deliberately
in
the
convenient
pockets
he
drew
out
of
one
an
old
daily
news
and
from
the
other
a
pair
of
gloves
his
amazement
was
indescribable
but
he
soon
joined
in
the
general
merriment
at
his
expense
for
mary
and
jeanne
the
cousins
and
even
pelletier
had
been
called
as
umpires
to
decide
the
case
between
us
the
new
coat
had
been
left
in
the
and
it
was
the
old
one
given
as
a
pattern
to
the
tailor
which
had
been
tried
on
the
best
of
it
was
that
on
the
day
of
the
ceremony
gilbert
committed
the
same
mistake
luckily
i
perceived
it
when
he
had
still
time
to
change
he
attached
so
little
importance
to
his
toilet
that
he
never
knew
when
he
was
in
want
of
anything
yet
his
appearance
was
never
untidy
in
spite
of
his
omissions
i
remember
a
little
typical
incident
about
this
disinclination
to
give
a
thought
to
needful
though
prosaic
details
before
leaving
for
england
on
one
occasion
i
had
repeatedly
called
his
attention
to
what
he
required
in
particular
a
warm
winter
suit
and
an
overcoat
he
had
promised
several
times
to
order
them
but
when
the
day
of
our
departure
arrived
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
it
no
matter
he
said
i
shall
get
them
in
london
and
with
the
too
in
england
we
found
the
temperature
already
severe
and
i
urged
him
to
make
his
purchases
on
the
very
same
day
he
announced
complacently
that
he
had
made
them
and
they
were
to
be
sent
on
the
morrow
he
was
quite
proud
of
having
got
through
the
business
particularly
because
he
had
bought
suits
though
he
needed
only
one
the
other
would
turn
out
useful
some
time
he
said
and
lo
when
the
box
was
opened
i
discovered
that
instead
of
clothes
fit
for
visits
he
had
been
persuaded
to
accept
a
sort
of
of
coarse
gray
tweed
waistcoat
and
trousers
to
match
with
a
pair
of
boots
only
fit
for
mountaineering
when
i
told
him
my
opinion
he
acknowledged
it
to
be
right
but
said
the
tailor
had
assured
him
that
they
would
be
lasting
and
he
added
i
was
in
a
hurry
having
to
go
to
the
national
gallery
and
i
felt
confident
the
man
would
know
what
i
wanted
after
telling
him
mary
was
married
on
september
and
she
was
so
much
loved
in
the
village
that
every
cottage
sent
at
least
one
of
its
members
to
the
ceremony
the
children
whom
she
had
taught
and
in
whom
she
had
always
taken
so
much
interest
came
in
numbers
and
the
evident
respectful
affection
of
these
simple
people
quite
moved
and
impressed
the
parents
of
raillard
her
father
was
also
pleased
with
the
presence
of
all
our
neighbors
and
friends
and
he
went
through
the
trying
day
with
entire
but
when
the
birds
had
flown
away
the
nest
seemed
empty
and
silent
indeed
and
to
fill
up
the
time
till
their
return
i
thought
a
little
cruise
on
wheels
would
be
the
best
diversion
the
weather
was
still
fine
and
warm
enough
for
working
from
nature
and
preparations
were
made
for
a
sketching
tour
in
which
pelletier
would
accompany
his
while
the
house
was
put
to
rights
again
they
started
with
cadette
and
went
successively
to
etang
nizier
charbonnat
luzy
la
l√©ger
and
la
a
most
picturesque
excursion
from
which
my
husband
brought
back
several
interesting
studies
the
day
after
the
return
pelletier
and
his
family
left
us
my
brother
his
wife
and
daughters
who
had
been
bridesmaids
having
preceded
them
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
raoul
raillard
and
his
wife
came
back
to
spend
with
us
the
rest
of
the
vacation
the
day
they
went
away
the
diary
said
we
bore
the
separation
pretty
well
yes
we
bore
it
pretty
well
this
time
because
it
was
not
to
be
very
long
it
had
been
decided
that
as
soon
as
the
young
couple
were
settled
in
their
apartments
we
should
become
their
guests
my
husband
hoping
in
this
way
to
see
the
great
exhibition
at
leisure
and
without
fatigue
we
arrived
at
raillard
on
october
and
the
very
next
day
saw
us
in
the
english
fine
arts
department
of
the
exhibition
our
daughter
lived
in
the
rue
de
la
tour
at
passy
an
easy
walking
distance
to
the
champ
de
mars
and
her
father
made
it
a
rule
to
go
there
on
foot
with
me
every
morning
between
the
first
breakfast
and
√†
la
the
plan
answered
very
well
we
were
almost
alone
in
the
rooms
and
could
see
the
pictures
at
our
leisure
my
husband
took
his
notes
with
ease
and
comfort
without
nervousness
after
a
two
study
we
went
back
to
the
family
lunch
and
such
was
improvement
in
health
that
he
often
took
us
again
to
the
exhibition
in
the
afternoon
merely
for
pleasure
he
enjoyed
the
works
of
art
immensely
and
said
that
he
felt
like
a
ravenous
man
to
whom
a
splendid
banquet
was
offered
being
also
greatly
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
various
sciences
he
liked
to
become
acquainted
with
all
new
inventions
and
often
resorted
to
the
galerie
des
machines
seeley
had
been
told
of
our
intended
visit
to
england
in
case
my
husband
did
not
feel
any
bad
effects
from
the
stay
in
paris
and
he
wrote
it
is
fortunate
that
you
are
coming
just
now
when
we
want
to
start
the
on
a
new
career
it
will
be
delightful
to
consult
over
it
with
you
do
not
exhaust
your
energy
in
paris
and
find
you
have
none
left
to
bring
you
over
to
england
although
he
worked
unremittingly
he
felt
no
fatigue
his
nervous
system
was
quiet
and
allowed
him
to
seek
diligently
for
promises
of
new
talent
among
the
mass
of
painters
and
engravers
and
to
feast
his
artistic
sense
in
the
exposition
du
centenaire
he
also
gave
more
than
his
usual
attention
to
sculpture
and
was
of
opinion
that
france
remained
unrivalled
in
that
branch
of
art
on
our
way
to
england
we
stopped
at
chantilly
and
slept
at
calais
in
the
h√¥tel
maritime
on
the
new
pier
i
almost
believe
that
we
happened
to
be
the
first
travellers
asking
for
a
bedroom
for
the
waiters
offered
excuses
for
the
still
incomplete
furnishing
and
for
the
service
not
being
yet
properly
organized
after
a
good
night
rest
we
visited
calais
maritime
and
the
important
engineering
works
there
for
which
my
husband
expressed
great
admiration
on
arriving
in
london
we
went
straight
to
and
seeley
who
had
kindly
invited
us
to
stay
with
them
till
we
found
comfortable
lodgings
it
was
not
gilbert
intention
to
stay
long
in
england
this
time
he
had
come
mainly
to
discuss
with
seeley
the
improvements
they
both
desired
to
introduce
in
the
portfolio
and
to
choose
the
illustrations
for
man
in
art
in
order
not
to
lose
time
he
decided
to
take
lodgings
in
a
central
part
as
near
to
the
national
gallery
as
possible
but
he
wished
the
street
not
to
be
noisy
he
found
what
he
wanted
in
craven
street
this
time
he
had
to
pay
calls
alone
and
to
beg
our
friends
to
excuse
me
for
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
master
my
sorrow
sufficiently
to
allow
of
my
resuming
social
intercourse
without
fear
of
breaking
down
with
her
tender
sympathy
seeley
bore
with
me
and
strove
to
console
me
when
my
resignation
failed
but
i
could
but
feel
that
i
was
a
saddening
guest
while
we
were
still
at
nutfield
palmer
the
son
of
samuel
palmer
who
had
a
warm
admiration
for
hamerton
had
been
invited
to
meet
him
and
he
brought
his
camera
with
him
proposing
to
take
our
photographs
the
portraits
of
the
ladies
were
failures
seeley
was
fairly
successful
but
my
husband
was
the
best
portrait
we
had
ever
seen
of
him
very
fine
and
characteristic
we
had
intended
to
spend
only
two
or
three
days
with
and
madame
raillard
on
our
return
but
our
being
obliged
to
leave
suddenly
on
account
of
his
grandmother
illness
and
unwilling
to
expose
his
wife
to
contagion
we
offered
to
remain
with
her
till
he
should
come
back
we
soon
received
the
sad
news
of
the
deaths
at
an
interval
of
two
days
only
of
the
grandmother
and
an
aunt
also
of
the
dangerous
illness
of
madame
raillard
senior
which
happily
did
not
prove
fatal
the
disease
having
apparently
spent
its
virulence
on
the
two
first
victims
during
our
enforced
stay
in
paris
gilbert
wrote
an
article
for
the
photographic
quarterly
on
photogravure
and
h√©liogravure
and
for
the
portfolio
a
review
of
pennell
book
on
drawing
we
went
by
boat
to
suresnes
to
see
the
banks
of
the
seine
for
mary
was
trying
to
draw
us
to
live
nearer
to
her
with
her
husband
she
had
already
visited
several
pretty
places
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
and
had
given
us
some
very
tempting
descriptions
as
for
me
i
should
have
desired
nothing
better
than
to
live
near
to
my
daughter
but
i
never
expected
my
husband
to
reconcile
himself
to
town
life
there
was
a
marked
and
decided
improvement
in
his
ability
to
travel
for
he
did
not
suffer
at
all
on
the
way
home
it
is
true
that
we
strictly
adhered
to
the
rule
of
slow
and
night
trains
the
pleasant
exercise
of
riding
had
to
be
reluctantly
given
up
because
cadette
who
had
betrayed
from
the
beginning
a
slight
weakness
in
the
knees
now
stumbled
often
and
badly
especially
out
of
harness
the
veterinary
surgeon
who
had
examined
her
before
we
bought
her
had
said
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
only
the
result
of
poor
feeding
and
would
disappear
after
a
course
of
prolonged
instead
of
disappearing
the
tendency
had
so
much
increased
that
it
was
deemed
safer
not
to
trust
cadette
even
in
the
carriage
at
least
for
a
while
this
mishap
was
the
beginning
of
my
husband
real
appreciation
of
velocipedes
he
had
liked
them
well
enough
from
the
first
and
used
to
hire
one
now
and
then
but
it
was
only
after
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
good
tricycle
that
the
taste
for
the
kind
of
exercise
it
affords
developed
itself
apace
raillard
had
made
him
a
present
of
one
for
which
he
had
little
use
in
paris
and
this
present
having
been
made
just
after
mary
betrothal
her
father
playfully
said
that
he
had
sold
his
daughter
for
a
velocipede
as
soon
as
he
had
adopted
the
machine
as
his
ordinary
steed
he
began
to
consider
how
to
make
it
carry
his
sketching
apparatus
he
invented
various
straps
boxes
holders
rings
fitting
in
different
places
according
to
the
bulk
and
nature
of
the
things
he
wished
to
have
with
him
a
sketching
umbrella
a
stool
and
all
that
was
needful
for
etching
or
he
also
devised
a
zinc
box
easily
adapted
to
the
tricycle
to
take
his
letters
manuscripts
and
parcels
to
the
post
and
found
it
very
convenient
at
the
end
of
january
he
was
seized
with
an
attack
of
gout
which
lasted
a
week
and
took
him
quite
by
surprise
for
he
had
not
neglected
physical
exercise
the
doctor
however
said
that
an
attack
of
gout
might
be
brought
on
by
a
mere
change
of
locality
and
we
had
just
returned
from
paris
he
strove
to
do
some
work
in
spite
of
pain
and
bad
nights
and
succeeded
now
and
then
and
as
soon
as
he
could
manage
with
help
to
get
into
the
carriage
he
drove
out
for
change
of
air
in
march
he
received
from
watts
the
permission
he
had
asked
to
have
his
portrait
of
lord
lawrence
engraved
i
transcribe
watts
letters
with
two
others
which
had
preceded
it
to
show
in
what
esteem
he
held
his
correspondent
opinions

my

our
short
talk
was
very
interesting
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
have
an
opportunity
of
explaining
my
views
on
art
and
the
practice
of
it
which
opportunity
i
hope
you
will
give
me
at
some
future
time
i
have
asked
hollyer
of
pembroke
square
kensington
to
let
you
have
prints
of
lord
lawrence
and
peabody
on
the
other
side
of
the
sheet
i
send
the
permission
you
require
monkshatch
guildford
surrey
my
dear
sir
i
have
just
seen
the
december
number
of
the
of
art
in
which
i
find
an
engraving
of
my
portrait
of
peabody
i
did
not
know
that
it
would
be
there
but
i
have
given
spielman
a
sort
of
general
permission
to
use
certain
of
the
photographs
i
do
not
know
whether
the
appearance
of
the
head
will
vitiate
the
interest
of
your
proposed
publication
but
i
hope
not
as
the
use
of
it
will
be
of
a
very
different
nature
i
am
much
gratified
by
what
you
said
of
my
works
in
your
letter
to
me
however
limited
may
be
the
result
of
my
efforts
i
have
worked
from
the
very
beginning
with
sincerity
of
aim
certainly
never
regarding
the
as
a
trade
and
for
some
years
not
considering
my
avocation
as
a
profession
declining
to
paint
portraits
professionally
or
to
take
commissions
such
wares
as
i
may
have
of
an
unimportant
aim
and
character
i
am
not
unwilling
to
sell
as
lord
derby
is
not
unwilling
to
sell
his
coals
for
i
am
not
wealthy
and
find
many
good
ways
of
using
money
but
i
do
not
regard
my
art
as
a
source
of
income
any
longer
i
hope
some
day
to
have
the
pleasure
of
discussing
certain
artistic
questions
with
you
monkshatch
guildford
surrey
my
dear
sir
the
picture
of
lord
lawrence
is
in
my
possession
and
the
engraver
may
have
it
for
two
weeks
in
may
or
june
of
course
he
is
trustworthy
the
picture
being
one
of
those
i
have
made
over
to
the
nation
i
lend
it
with
a
certain
hesitation
as
i
do
not
consider
it
belongs
to
me
i
am
flattered
by
the
opinion
of
the
young
men
especially
as
i
think
i
may
hope
it
becomes
more
favorable
with
time
the
portrait
of
tennyson
is
at
south
kensington
and
no
doubt
i
can
easily
manage
that
frank
short
should
have
access
to
it
i
do
not
expect
to
be
in
town
for
good
before
the
end
of
april
but
here
i
am
within
an
hour
and
a
half
of
london
although
a
great
amount
of
labor
had
been
bestowed
upon
man
in
art
the
author
thought
it
advanced
but
slowly
and
became
anxious
as
the
year
wore
on
in
july
he
wrote
a
long
explanatory
letter
to
craik
and
received
this
answer
i
am
much
interested
in
your
report
of
what
has
been
done
towards
the
new
book
you
have
done
a
good
bit
of
work
and
i
think
you
have
made
a
thoroughly
interesting
selection
of
pictures
you
have
an
almost
endless
field
to
choose
from
is
quite
impossible
to
publish
this
but
you
ought
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
prepare
for
next
autumn
it
is
strange
how
long
a
book
with
illustrations
takes
to
get
ready
but
the
disappointment
when
many
artists
are
at
work
is
proverbial
i
look
forward
with
sanguine
interest
to
the
publication
next
year
note
in
the
diary
i
feel
much
relieved
by
this
letter
altogether
a
day
of
although
he
had
taken
an
immense
quantity
of
notes
both
in
london
and
paris
my
husband
was
sometimes
greatly
perplexed
by
the
want
of
references
and
said
almost
desperately
no
one
has
any
idea
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
my
work
in
my
situation
far
from
picture
galleries
museums
and
libraries
it
is
so
arduous
that
at
times
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
go
on
it
is
too
much
for
the
brain
to
carry
so
many
images
to
remember
so
many
things
without
the
possibility
of
refreshing
my
memory
of
settling
a
doubt
of
filling
up
a
gap
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
wonder
at
the
extraordinary
feats
of
literary
production
which
he
was
compelled
to
accomplish
under
such
unfavorable
circumstances
ah
those
who
knew
of
it
said
that
his
store
of
accumulated
knowledge
must
be
marvellous
indeed
and
yet
the
only
remedy
was
hardly
to
be
hinted
at
i
felt
so
certain
that
he
would
be
miserable
in
a
great
capital
that
i
never
mentioned
the
possibility
of
living
in
one
of
them
he
was
sufficiently
aware
of
its
desirability
early
in
the
summer
as
i
had
suffered
much
from
rheumatism
our
doctor
insisted
upon
my
being
sent
to
for
a
course
of
baths
i
was
most
unwilling
to
leave
my
husband
now
that
mary
was
married
and
away
but
he
said
the
hope
that
the
treatment
would
do
me
good
was
enough
to
make
him
bear
his
temporary
loneliness
cheerfully
and
then
my
mother
would
come
to
stay
with
him
as
i
was
very
myself
he
promised
to
make
a
break
in
our
separation
by
coming
to
see
me
when
the
first
half
of
my
season
at
the
baths
was
over
i
saw
him
arrive
in
the
little
gig
with
bulliot
who
had
come
on
an
antiquarian
quest
they
went
together
to
see
the
curious
simple
church
of
nazaire
eleventh
century
of
which
my
husband
made
a
drawing
he
also
sketched
a
view
of
the
loire
which
may
be
seen
from
the
height
above
for
a
great
length
of
its
sleepy
course
in
the
course
of
the
vacation
my
husband
listened
pretty
regularly
to
raillard
english
readings
out
of
emerson
or
tennyson
while
he
occasionally
read
a
little
german
with
his
he
was
very
desirous
of
resuming
the
study
of
that
language
which
he
said
would
be
of
great
service
in
his
studies
but
he
was
not
able
to
find
the
time
italian
absorbing
all
he
could
spare
two
masters
or
rather
a
master
and
a
mistress
had
been
recommended
to
him
and
when
he
could
manage
it
he
wrote
to
them
alternately
long
letters
in
italian
which
they
returned
corrected
bodley
an
english
gentleman
who
was
studying
french
institutions
and
politics
most
seriously
and
who
was
acquainted
with
works
came
in
august
to
see
him
this
visit
was
the
beginning
of
a
lasting
acquaintance
which
was
appreciated
and
valued
by
both
parties
when
we
settled
in
the
parc
des
princes
and
when
after
his
marriage
bodley
resided
in
paris
they
met
with
new
pleasure
and
fresh
interest
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
itself
bodley
was
commencing
his
studies
on
prance
for
the
work
he
had
just
undertaken
for
macmillan
which
should
essay
to
do
for
france
what
bryce
had
done
for
the
united
states
in
his
american
commonwealth
recognizing
hamerton
as
the
chief
english
authority
on
all
french
questions
he
had
soon
after
his
first
arrival
in
paris
been
put
into
communication
with
him
by
the
good
offices
of
a
common
friend
in
the
diplomatic
service
a
correspondence
ensued
in
the
first
letter
of
which
my
husband
gave
bodley
some
advice
on
an
article
the
latter
had
been
requested
to
write
for
the
quarterly
review
on
provincial
france
before
he
had
had
any
opportunity
of
studying
the
french
provinces
here
is
part
of
the
letter
autun
my
dear
sir
it
is
a
laudable
though
an
extraordinary
desire
on
your
part
to
know
something
about
the
subject
you
have
to
treat
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
case
before
i
have
known
france
for
years
and
find
generally
that
english
critics
who
know
nothing
two
miles
from
the
british
embassy
are
ready
enough
to
set
me
down
and
teach
me
my
proper
place
i
send
by
this
post
a
colis
postal
containing
my
house
by
france
provinciale
par
ren√©
millet
and
english
by
i
have
not
a
copy
of
the
english
edition
of
and
english
but
the
tauchnitz
is
better
as
it
had
the
benefit
of
correction
you
ought
to
notice
with
reference
to
provincial
france
the
extreme
difficulty
of
making
any
general
statements
that
are
true
for
example
it
is
believed
in
england
that
all
french
land
is
cut
up
into
small
bits
a
traveller
who
writes
in
the
newspaper
said
lately
that
although
the
greater
number
of
proprietors
in
the
forest
lands
of
the
ni√®vre
were
small
owners
the
greater
part
of
the
land
was
in
the
possession
of
large
owners
and
he
mentioned
one
who
he
said
owned
hectares
more
than
acres
of
excellent
forest
he
did
not
give
the
name
there
are
several
large
landowners
in
this
neighborhood
one
had
an
income
of
a
year
but
it
was
divided
amongst
his
children
france
is
a
very
various
country
and
therefore
difficult
to
know
if
you
have
h
book
amongst
those
you
notice
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
a
strictly
partisan
publication
hostile
to
all
republicans
against
whom
the
author
seems
to
have
taken
a
brief
etc
then
followed
some
other
letters
from
which
i
give
a
few
paragraphs
autun
you
have
done
an
imprudent
thing
in
not
publishing
your
article
at
once
there
are
two
times
for
writing
first
when
you
know
nothing
secondly
when
you
know
a
great
deal
the
intermediate
time
that
of
acquisition
is
not
favorable
to
writing
because
it
destroys
the
author
confidence
in
himself
he
possesses
that
confidence
before
learning
and
renews
it
when
he
has
learned
in
the
interval
he
suffers
from
diffidence
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
jusserand
likes
my
books
he
is
just
the
kind
of
frenchman
whose
opinion
one
really
values
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
can
come
i
shall
be
away
part
of
september
all
august
i
shall
be
at
home
but
if
you
could
have
come
about
now
it
would
have
been
better
still
the
shortest
rout
from
paris
to
autun
as
to
mere
distance
is
by
laroche
gravant
avallon
etc
in
the
present
case
i
strongly
recommend
the
shorter
and
more
rural
route
as
being
by
far
the
prettier
and
less
fatiguing
and
also
because
it
enables
you
to
see
one
of
the
most
picturesque
small
towns
in
france
avallon
you
have
five
hours
to
see
avallon
and
the
picturesque
valley
that
it
overlooks
the
next
morning
you
will
of
course
be
occupied
in
seeing
autun
but
if
you
will
make
your
way
to
the
railway
station
so
as
to
be
there
at
you
will
see
a
vehicle
with
yellow
wheels
and
a
chestnut
mare
with
a
white
mark
on
her
face
the
said
vehicle
will
bring
you
to
if
you
will
kindly
allow
it
to
do
so
in
time
for
d√©jeuner
please
let
me
know
the
day
it
would
be
better
not
to
make
any
arrangement
about
your
departure
as
i
may
be
able
to
persuade
you
to
take
some
drives
with
me
to
see
something
in
this
neighborhood
autun
i
received
the
this
morning
and
read
your
article
towards
the
close
you
say
every
frenchman
in
the
provinces
works
that
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
a
mistake
unfortunately
there
is
still
a
strong
survival
of
the
old
caste
prejudice
against
work
as
being
beneath
a
gentleman
all
the
young
men
i
know
whose
parents
are
very
well
off
as
idle
as
they
can
be
unless
they
go
into
the
army
or
the
and
now
they
hardly
ever
go
into
the
church
or
when
they
do
it
is
in
some
order
jesuits
marists
i
was
talking
about
this
with
a
rich
old
french
gentleman
about
ten
days
ago
and
he
deeply
deplored
it
he
said
he
felt
more
respect
for
common
workmen
than
for
the
idle
young
men
in
his
own
class
you
appear
to
think
that
the
morvan
language
is
a
celtic
tongue
no
it
is
only
a
french
patois
very
interesting
and
peculiar
in
its
grammatical
forms
i
understand
it
partly
when
spoken
and
can
read
it
with
some
little
difficulty
my
daughter
understands
it
very
well
our
servants
speak
it
among
themselves
their
french
is
very
pure
though
somewhat
limited
in
its
vocabulary
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
happily
endowed
and
situated
for
undertaking
a
work
of
the
kind
you
intend
to
write
you
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
you
have
no
prejudices
you
desire
nothing
but
to
be
just
and
especially
you
have
that
very
rare
quality
a
right
curiosity
i
was
pleased
and
a
little
amused
by
the
contrast
when
i
compared
you
with
the
strangely
uninterested
english
whom
i
have
seen
in
and
out
of
france
i
recollect
staying
with
a
friend
in
england
a
few
years
ago
and
i
noticed
that
did
not
ask
me
one
single
question
about
he
simply
talked
of
his
own
locality
and
did
not
appear
to
take
the
slightest
interest
in
the
continent
of
europe
you
made
me
pass
a
very
pleasant
day
which
encourages
the
hope
that
you
will
come
again
to
this
neighborhood
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
seen
within
a
driving
radius
especially
if
you
consent
to
sleep
one
night
away
from
home
my
wife
and
i
are
going
to
paris
in
december
when
i
mean
to
look
you
up
to
another
visitor
whose
name
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
mention
my
husband
had
written
the
following
interesting
letter
whilst
driving
home
in
the
dark
after
saying
to
you
i
thought
over
your
remarks
about
the
great
revolution
in
habits
of
thought
which
must
take
place
in
consequence
of
the
influence
of
scientific
methods
the
difficulty
i
foresee
is
this
religions
supply
a
want
that
science
does
not
and
can
not
supply
they
answer
to
the
need
of
certain
emotions
trust
hope
joy
in
believing
the
happiness
of
thinking
that
we
are
each
of
us
individually
cared
for
by
a
supremely
good
and
father
women
especially
seem
to
need
these
emotions
to
make
life
happy
for
them
and
when
they
cease
to
believe
as
many
now
do
they
feel
a
sense
of
desolation
the
most
successful
religion
the
roman
has
succeeded
by
supplying
most
abundantly
that
care
and
those
consolations
which
women
expect
a
religion
to
give
and
which
science
does
not
the
least
degree
in
fact
women
usually
dislike
science
now
as
the
churches
maintain
themselves
chiefly
by
the
influence
and
support
of
women
may
they
not
continue
to
maintain
themselves
indefinitely
in
this
way
is
it
not
possible
to
mention
a
special
case
that
the
roman
catholic
church
may
exist
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
simply
as
a
provider
of
the
kind
of
authority
and
the
kind
of
emotion
that
women
desire
and
that
they
can
not
obtain
from
science
a
friend
of
mine
considers
religion
absolutely
necessary
to
women
and
to
many
men
not
that
he
at
all
considers
religion
to
be
true
in
the
sense
but
the
scientific
truth
of
a
doctrine
is
quite
distinct
from
its
beneficial
effect
upon
the
mind
for
my
part
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
the
future
long
ago
i
used
to
hope
for
a
true
religion
but
now
i
see
that
if
it
is
to
be
free
from
mythology
it
ceases
to
be
a
religion
altogether
and
becomes
only
science
which
has
none
of
the
heating
and
energizing
force
that
a
real
religion
certainly
possesses
neither
has
science
its
power
of
uniting
men
in
bonds
of
brotherhood
and
in
giving
them
an
effective
hostile
action
against
others
as
religious
intolerance
does
on
the
subject
of
religious
belief
my
husband
had
written
previously
to
seeley
i
have
been
corresponding
with
a
friend
the
same
mentioned
in
the
letter
to
another
visitor
about
the
religious
views
of
mark
pattison
and
dean
stanley
he
knew
both
of
them
and
quite
confirms
what
i
had
heard
before
that
they
were
no
more
believers
than
renan
pattison
he
describes
as
a
conservative
agnostic
or
pantheist
meaning
by
a
man
who
thought
it
better
to
preserve
old
forms
i
recollect
that
appleton
told
me
when
he
was
here
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
obligation
on
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
to
believe
in
the
divinity
of
christ
and
that
many
clergymen
in
the
present
day
including
pattison
had
no
such
belief
my
friend
himself
seems
to
be
an
agnostic
and
a
strong
supporter
of
the
church
of
england
at
the
same
time
and
quite
lately
he
earnestly
counselled
some
young
english
ladies
who
were
unitarians
but
obliged
to
live
abroad
to
join
the
church
of
england
for
the
sake
of
fellowship
he
tells
me
that
there
is
in
dean
stanley
institutions
an
exposition
of
the
apostles
creed
containing
hardly
a
syllable
to
which
renan
could
not
subscribe
from
all
this
it
would
appear
that
some
at
least
of
the
english
clergy
have
adopted
the
jesuit
principle
practically
so
convenient
by
which
any
one
may
have
an
esoteric
religion
for
himself
as
the
comfortable
lining
of
the
cloak
and
an
esoteric
religion
for
other
people
as
the
outside
of
the
cloak
meanwhile
these
clergymen
are
deeply
respected
whilst
honest
men
whose
opinions
are
not
one
whit
more
heretical
are
stigmatized
as
and
excluded
from
society
you
seem
to
have
got
into
a
curious
condition
in
england
surely
many
laymen
are
right
in
distrusting
parsons
as
editor
of
the
portfolio
he
had
been
contributing
articles
from
time
to
time
but
seeley
was
anxious
to
see
him
undertake
an
important
series
for
the
following
year
he
proposed
different
subjects
likely
to
tempt
the
author
fancy
and
suggested
turner
in
switzerland
but
one
of
the
difficulties
was
the
quantity
of
work
done
by
turner
in
switzerland
and
the
time
that
would
be
required
to
follow
in
his
steps
another
suggestion
of
seeley
was
to
write
about
a
group
of
french
living
artists
who
would
be
good
representatives
of
the
modern
school
and
whose
works
would
furnish
striking
illustrations
he
said
with
his
usual
kind
thoughtfulness
i
must
confess
that
my
suggestion
of
a
french
subject
arose
partly
from
the
pleasure
you
would
find
in
paying
a
visit
to
your
daughter
at
paris
and
partly
also
from
the
reflection
that
paris
is
not
far
from
london
hamerton
had
proposed
the
louvre
but
it
was
feared
that
the
subject
would
not
be
a
popular
one
and
after
mature
consideration
the
idea
of
a
connected
series
of
articles
on
modern
french
painters
was
entertained
by
both
publisher
and
editor
seeley
wrote
i
was
rather
in
hopes
that
my
vague
suggestion
of
a
subject
might
take
root
in
your
mind
and
develop
into
something
definite
or
to
change
the
metaphor
that
it
might
be
a
spark
to
kindle
your
invention
i
think
such
a
series
would
be
interesting
here
and
would
furnish
admirable
subjects
for
twelve
etchings
a
journey
to
paris
was
then
decided
upon
for
the
winter
the
sa√¥ne
cruise
proved
particularly
pleasant
this
time
on
account
of
the
welcome
offered
to
the
passengers
of
by
several
friends
at
neuville
who
most
hospitably
entertained
them
on
land
and
water
they
were
invited
on
board
and
petite
amie
and
raced
against
them
it
was
a
comfort
to
my
husband
to
feel
himself
among
friends
for
he
suddenly
suffered
from
an
irregular
action
of
the
heart
which
lasted
for
hours
but
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
came
he
had
had
another
distress
of
the
same
kind
in
the
summer
but
only
of
a
couple
of
hours
duration
i
had
entreated
him
to
see
a
doctor
at
the
time
but
he
said
it
was
only
nervousness
at
neuville
likewise
he
refused
to
seek
advice
feeling
sure
it
would
cease
of
itself
and
now
i
have
the
painful
certainty
that
he
was
already
laboring
under
the
symptoms
of
heart
disease
still
he
speedily
recovered
and
resumed
his
studies
in
and
in
the
day
after
i
see
by
this
note
in
the
diary
that
he
was
well
satisfied
with
his
boat
my
studies
occupied
me
till
and
then
after
we
started
in
to
try
an
experiment
in
sailing
with
a
breeze
so
light
as
to
be
imperceptible
sheets
not
even
stretched
yet
we
went
up
as
far
as
pont
vert
and
beyond
we
might
have
gone
further
but
came
back
to
call
upon
madame
vibert
in
october
hamerton
wrote
an
article
for
chambers
encyclopaedia
on
the
history
of
art
and
another
for
the
portfolio
on
national
supremacy
in
painting
having
been
asked
to
contribute
to
the
forum
he
began
in
november
an
article
on
home
life
in
france
he
was
always
anxious
to
clear
up
any
international
misunderstanding
between
france
and
england
and
had
written
in
may
to
the
pall
mall
gazette
an
explanatory
letter
on
the
persecution
of
the
church
by
the
republic
as
regarded
the
execution
of
the
decrees
concerning
religious
orders
he
had
also
sent
a
letter
to
the
academy
on
france
and
the
republic
although
very
tolerant
himself
in
matters
of
religion
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
state
whether
under
a
republic
or
a
monarchy
had
a
right
to
exact
obedience
to
its
laws
as
well
from
religious
bodies
as
from
private
persons
and
that
a
republican
government
ought
not
to
be
accused
of
tyranny
because
it
enforced
the
execution
of
these
general
laws
but
people
are
very
apt
to
take
the
view
which
de
cassagnac
so
frankly
avowed
when
addressing
the
republican
party
in
the
chamber
we
claim
unbounded
liberty
for
ourselves
because
you
promise
it
in
your
programme
but
we
refuse
it
to
you
because
it
is
contrary
to
our
principles
about
the
middle
of
november
there
was
copied
into
the
temps
an
anonymous
letter
which
had
appeared
in
truth
professing
to
express
the
hostile
feelings
entertained
by
english
naval
officers
against
the
officers
of
the
french
fleet
which
had
recently
visited
malta
this
roused
hamerton
indignation
the
more
so
as
he
never
for
one
moment
believed
the
discourteous
and
outrageous
letter
to
be
genuine
i
transcribe
his
explanation
of
the
incident
as
given
by
himself
to

a
few
days
later
the
following
letter
was
received
by
hamerton
benbow
dear
sir
i
hope
you
will
kindly
assist
us
in
getting
the
gross
misstatements
copied
from
as
to
our
feelings
towards
the
french
navy
contradicted
you
will
perceive
that
the
paper
i
enclose
is
signed
by
an
officer
representing
each
ship
and
that
most
ranks
in
the
service
are
also
represented
thereon
any
expense
that
may
be
incurred
would
you
kindly
let
me
know
yours
faithfully
rawson
capt
the
protestation
which
accompanied
the
letter
ran
thus
benbow
at
malta
dear
sir
your
letter
of
the
of
november
sent
to
the
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
mediterranean
has
been
forwarded
to
us
and
we
have
to
thank
you
for
having
called
our
attention
to
the
paragraph
in
the
copied
from
of
the
of
october
referring
to
the
language
in
the
editor
of
the
says
that
he
hopes
it
will
be
protested
against
in
england
the
paragraph
had
been
seen
and
commented
on
by
our
officers
but
as
in
england
no
one
ever
takes
the
trouble
to
answer
or
contradict
any
statement
made
in
that
paper
and
as
in
this
case
its
object
was
so
palpably
political
viz
to
cause
the
present
government
trouble
and
prevent
the
cordiality
and
friendship
that
has
existed
so
long
between
the
two
nations
no
notice
was
taken
of
it
but
when
a
paper
of
such
importance
as
the
copies
the
paragraph
and
it
is
thus
brought
before
the
french
nation
it
at
once
becomes
important
and
demands
a
protest
and
a
denial
as
you
have
already
taken
an
interest
in
the
matter
we
are
led
to
hope
that
you
will
assist
us
in
procuring
the
insertion
in
any
french
papers
that
may
have
copied
this
paragraph
most
especially
the
the
naval
papers
and
the
local
papers
at
toulon
of
a
protest
on
the
part
of
the
officers
of
the
english
fleet
in
the
mediterranean
against
the
language
of
the
article
and
to
deny
on
our
part
any
such
feelings
or
ideas
as
are
attributed
to
us
in
it
we
beg
to
assure
you
that
it
gave
us
real
and
unfeigned
pleasure
to
see
the
french
fleet
in
our
midst
at
malta
and
that
what
little
we
were
able
to
do
to
make
their
visit
agreeable
and
pleasant
was
done
from
no
feeling
of
duty
or
even
as
a
mere
return
for
the
kindly
reception
accorded
to
us
at
toulon
but
from
a
sincere
appreciation
of
the
high
qualities
of
french
naval
officers
and
a
desire
to
cultivate
their
friendship
we
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
your
obedient
servants
three
weeks
later
came
a
letter
of
thanks
closing
the
incident
which
had
caused
no
little
trouble
to
hamerton
malta
dear
hamerton
thank
you
very
much
in
the
name
of
the
english
navy
for
so
kindly
assisting
us
to
repel
the
gross
insinuations
of
also
for
the
extracts
and
the
trouble
you
have
taken
for
us
i
only
regret
that
you
should
have
drawn
on
you
i
have
shown
your
letter
to
the
admiral
and
all
the
officers
here
who
are
much
pleased
with
all
that
has
been
done
again
thanking
you
believe
me
yours
truly
h
rawson
hamerton
considered
himself
well
rewarded
for
his
exertions
by
the
tokens
of
warm
approval
he
received
both
from
england
and
from
france
french
and
english
did
not
meet
with
the
success
it
deserved
though
it
was
published
in
england
america
and
france
and
in
the
tauchnitz
edition
the
author
had
entertained
few
illusions
about
the
fate
of
the
work
for
some
reasons
which
he
has
himself
explained
in
private
letters
and
in
his
prefaces
to
the
book
he
once
wrote
in
answer
to
a
letter
from
raillard
vous
lisez
mes
livres
un
peu
sans
doute
pour
faire
plaisir
au
vieux
papa

je
crois
r√©ellement

de

de

tous
les
√©crivains
clairs
comme
√©crivains
superficiels
but
he
said
in
the
preface
to
the
tauchnitz
edition
the
kind
of
success
most
gratifying
to
me
after
writing
a
book
of
this
kind
would
be
to
convert
some
readers
to
my
own
method
or
rule
in
the
formation
of
opinion
whether
it
concerns
one
side
or
the
other
my
method
is
a
good
one
but
not
so
good
for
eloquence
as
the
hastier
methods
of
journalism
and
in
the
preface
of
the
english
edition
i
should
like
to
write
with
complete
impartiality
if
it
were
possible
i
have
at
least
written
with
the
most
sincere
desire
to
be
impartial
and
that
perhaps
at
the
cost
of
some
popularity
in
england
for
certain
english
critics
have
told
me
that
impartiality
is
not
patriotic
and
others
have
informed
me
of
what
i
did
not
know
before
namely
that
i
prefer
the
french
to
my
own
countrymen
though
french
and
english
never
became
what
may
be
called
a
popular
book
it
nevertheless
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
the
author
received
a
great
number
of
letters
expressive
of
admiration
and
gratitude
for
the
clear
discernment
and
impartiality
with
which
the
differences
existing
between
the
two
nations
had
been
studied
and
expounded
here

truly
i
also
give
a
passage
from
one
of
calderon
letters
last
night
to
my
regret
i
finished
the
last
chapter
of
your
and
english
i
am
delighted
with
its
truth
remember
as
an
excuse
for
giving
an
opinion
so
freely
that
i
too
am
very
fairly
acquainted
with
both
countries
their
capitals
and
provinces
the
book
as
i
have
said
was
translated
into
french
and
as
usual
the
author
took
the
trouble
of
revising
the
translation
far
from
taking
any
pride
in
the
fact
that
the
translation
of
his
works
was
desired
and
sought
after
he
dreaded
it
and
would
even
have
opposed
it
had
the
thing
been
in
his
power
the
inevitable
loss
of
his
style
upon
which
he
always
bestowed
such
conscientious
care
was
to
him
almost
unbearable

we
left
home
on
december
and
spent
a
day
and
two
nights
very
agreeably
at
dijon
with
the
parents
of
our
then
we
went
on
to
paris
by
an
early
morning
train
which
necessitated
our
lunching
in
the
carriage
we
were
to
stay
with
our
daughter
and
her
husband
but
gilbert
took
a
separate
study
for
his
work
in
a
quiet
house
in
the
same
street
my
husband
had
himself
made
a
careful
drawing
for
richard
monument
and
now
being
in
paris
we
went
to
see
it
and
wished
to
have
it
completed
by
an
inscription
hitherto
we
had
not
agreed
about
any
but
as
we
were
sadly
recalling
his
last
intimate
talk
it
seemed
that
the
desire
for
peace
which
he
had
expressed
should
be
recorded
as
an
acquittal
of
the
deed
which
brought
the
fulfilment
of
his
wish
and
his
father
caused
the
word
to
be
engraved
at
the
head
of
the
tombstone
pelletier
having
been
promoted
to
the
√©conomat
of
the
old
and
famous
lyc√©e
henri
where
so
many
celebrated
frenchmen
have
been
educated
took
pleasure
in
showing
us
the
most
ancient
or
curious
parts
of
the
building
such
as
la
tour
clovis
the
vaulted
kitchen
the
painted
cupola
over
the
staircase
and
the
delicately
carved
panels
of
the
old
monks
library
now
the
professors
my
husband
was
much
interested
by
this
visit
and
repeated
it
shortly
after
in
the
company
of
and
mme
manesse
and
mme
flameng
pelletier
acting
as
cicerone
it
being
the
season
of
the
epiphany
our
niece
had
the
traditional
cake
served
on
the
and
the
royal
honors
fell
to
the
lot
of
her
uncle
he
chose
madame
flameng
for
his
queen
and
they
made
us
pass
a
merry
hour
under
their
joint
rule
the
serious
part
of
the
talk
had
concerned
the
possibility
of
engaging
flameng
to
engrave
one
of
his
son
pictures
he
had
consented
and
my
husband
called
upon
fran√ßois
flameng
to
make
a
choice
on
his
return
he
gave
me
a
description
of
the
studios
and
library
which
are
very
curious
and
offered
to
take
me
with
him
on
his
next
visit
to
renew
my
old
acquaintance
with
the
now
celebrated
artist
but
my
infirmity
would
have
rendered
awkward
the
introduction
to
his
young
wife
to
whom
the
memories
of
previous
friendship
did
not
extend
writing
once
to
seeley
about
my
deafness
my
husband
had
said
she
sits
surrounded
by
a
silent
world
and
sees
people
lips
move
and
their
gestures
how
difficult
it
is
to
imagine
such
a
state
of
existence
as
for
me
i
suffer
from
the
opposite
inconvenience
of
hearing
too
well
when
i
am
unwell
my
hearing
is
preternaturally
acute
so
that
my
watch
in
my
waistcoat
ticks
as
if
it
were
held
almost
close
to
my
ear
being
desirous
of
forming
a
sound
opinion
about
the
present
state
of
the
fine
arts
in
france
hamerton
went
to
visit
the
new
sorbonne
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
the
lyc√©e
janson
the
new
pictures
in
the
museum
of
the
luxembourg
those
in
the
private
exhibition
of
as
well
as
the
exhibitions
at
goupil
and
petit
he
saw
laurens
vo√ªte
rodin
studio
and
the
mus√©e
du
mobilier
national
with
its
beautiful
tapestries
we
left
paris
at
the
end
of
january
and
returned
home
my
husband
having
got
through
a
vast
amount
of
work
with
ease
and
pleasure
and
with
a
new
hopeful
confidence
in
his
powers
of
acquisition
and
endurance
and
also
with
a
gratifying
sense
of
his
acknowledged
standing
even
in
france
among
celebrated
artists
and
men
of
letters
at
the
easter
family
gathering
our
possible
change
of
residence
was
exhaustively
discussed
the
state
of
the
buildings
at
la
tuilerie
was
growing
worse
and
worse
every
day
and
my
brother
opinion
as
an
architect
having
been
asked
for
was
that
the
time
for
very
important
repairs
could
no
longer
be
postponed
new
roofs
would
have
to
be
built
one
of
the
walls
strengthened
the
floor
tiles
taken
up
and
the
woodwork
of
every
window
was
so
rotten
that
it
could
no
longer
hold
the
iron
with
which
it
had
already
been
mended
mary
and
her
husband
represented
what
a
heavy
outlay
would
be
required
if
we
undertook
these
repairs
and
also
said
with
great
truth
that
after
it
we
should
feel
bound
to
the
house
on
account
of
the
money
spent
on
it
it
was
an
opportunity
for
changing
a
mode
of
life
no
longer
adapted
to
our
wants
nor
to
our
years
why
such
a
big
house
for
two
solitary
beings
and
now
that
their
father
was
subject
to
attacks
of
gout
and
not
so
sure
of
immunity
from
colds
was
he
to
continue
to
have
the
care
of
horses
and
to
drive
in
an
open
carriage
in
all
weathers
could
we
be
so
easily
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
never
seeing
them
longer
than
the
short
space
of
five
weeks
every
year
when
there
was
no
plausible
reason
for
being
so
far
apart
their
father
disliked
great
cities
but
he
would
not
be
obliged
to
live
inside
paris
there
were
plenty
of
comfortable
and
quiet
villas
in
the
neighborhood
or
in
the
suburbs
from
which
paris
would
be
accessible
by
the
seine
thus
rendering
a
great
part
of
his
work
so
much
easier
he
on
his
part
objected
that
living
would
be
more
expensive
that
he
would
not
be
so
well
situated
for
working
from
nature
and
last
of
all
that
if
he
decided
for
a
change
he
would
expect
to
be
so
near
to
mary
and
her
husband
as
to
be
able
to
reach
them
on
foot
and
in
a
short
time
for
he
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
a
whole
day
every
time
he
went
to
see
them
the
two
requisites
he
said
life
in
the
country
and
frequent
meetings
can
not
be
reconciled
together
raillard
and
his
wife
praised
montmorency
meudon
marly
and
germain
which
they
had
visited
on
purpose
but
he
answered
that
any
of
these
places
would
be
too
far
off
however
when
stephen
mary
and
her
husband
had
left
us
their
father
was
not
proof
against
melancholy
thoughts
from
which
he
did
not
always
find
refuge
in
work
the
following
note
in
the
diary
is
a
proof
of
it
april
did
not
feel
disposed
to
work
on
account
of
the
departure
the
solitude
of
our
lives
had
also
been
considerably
increased
by
the
deaths
of
five
autunois
friends
and
by
the
departure
of
schmitt
with
his
family
my
husband
wrote
to
him
vous
me
demandez
des
nouvelles
mais
depuis
votre
d√©part
nous
y
allons
le
moins
possible
je
rien
√†
y
faire
presque
plus
personne
√†
y
voir
je
crains
m√™me
bout
certain
temps
cet
isolement
ne
produise
un
f√¢cheux
√©tat
dans
mon
esprit
je
me
plonge
dans
le
travail
le
refuge
des
gens
isol√©s
shortly
after
easter
there
came
an
attack
of
gout
this
time
in
one
knee
and
gilbert
was
naturally
disturbed
by
the
conviction
that
the
disease
had
become
more
threatening
now
that
it
was
going
up
he
became
more
alive
to
the
difficulties
of
our
present
conditions
of
existence
in
the
country
and
more
willing
to
consider
the
desirability
of
a
change
the
business
of
the
portfolio
would
be
so
much
more
easily
and
promptly
transacted
if
he
were
in
paris
correspondence
with
england
so
much
more
rapid
and
the
length
of
journeys
to
london
diminished
so
appreciably
that
all
these
considerations
were
of
great
weight
in
the
final
decision
as
well
as
others
of
a
different
nature
i
could
not
hope
to
hide
from
gilbert
the
void
left
in
my
life
by
the
loss
of
one
of
my
sons
and
the
absence
of
a
daughter
who
had
never
left
me
before
for
any
length
of
time
nor
the
sorrowful
recollections
incessantly
awakened
by
the
surrounding
scenes
and
objects
and
he
began
to
think
that
to
break
the
chain
of
such
painful
associations
might
be
beneficial
to
me
this
i
believe
dictated
his
letter
of
may
to
mary
in
which
he
told
her
that
she
might
make
serious
inquiries
for
a
house
as
he
had
definitely
decided
to
go
and
live
near
paris
seeley
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
the
editor
of
the
portfolio
would
be
nearer
to
england
he
said
i
hope
you
will
get
comfortably
settled
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
if
i
may
judge
by
my
own
experience
i
do
not
think
you
will
regret
the
change
i
have
never
done
so
for
a
moment
although
i
was
fond
of
kingston
since
he
had
been
last
at
burnley
and
had
seen
again
the
pictures
painted
at
sens
for
handsley
my
husband
had
been
dissatisfied
with
them
the
development
of
knowledge
skill
and
the
critical
faculty
made
him
intolerant
of
the
shortcomings
of
that
early
period
and
hopeful
of
doing
better
work
now
so
he
wrote
to
handsley
and
proposed
to
paint
him
two
new
pictures
to
replace
the
old
ones
in
the
reply
he
was
begged
to
think
of
no
such
thing
as
although
the
pictures
might
not
be
quite
satisfactory
to
him
the
owner
valued
them
as
among
the
earliest
productions
of
the
artist
but
gilbert
insisted
on
being
allowed
to
replace
at
least
the
view
of
sens
by
another
subject
already
begun
and
about
which
he
felt
hopeful
and
finally
it
was
left
to
him
to
do
as
he
liked
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
feeling
as
he
did
the
pressure
of
work
he
should
have
been
always
ready
to
undertake
some
additional
task
at
that
moment
when
he
had
so
little
spare
time
he
had
promised
for
an
indefinite
date
it
is
true
a
picture
of
mont
beuvray
for
bulliot
and
others
of
for
alice
gindriez
his
mary
also
was
to
have
her
share
the
pictures
intended
for
alice
gindriez
had
been
painted
several
times
over
and
destroyed
and
the
one
for
handsley
had
already
passed
through
various
changes
of
effect
but
it
looked
very
promising
the
artist
intended
to
send
it
to
the
salon
and
had
even
ordered
the
frame
but
our
removal
having
interrupted
painting
for
a
long
time
it
remained
unfinished
though
it
was
taken
up
again
at
intervals
it
is
my
belief
that
artistic
work
in
spite
of
its
disappointments
proved
a
relief
and
a
distraction
to
my
husband
but
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
his
own
standard
should
have
been
so
high
for
it
prevented
him
from
completing
and
keeping
many
etchings
and
pictures
which
if
not
perfect
still
possessed
great
charms
it
is
also
a
subject
for
regret
that
he
should
have
been
led
to
undertake
large
pictures
of
mountain
scenery
so
difficult
to
render
adequately
if
the
time
spent
in
fighting
against
these
difficulties
had
been
bestowed
upon
smaller
canvases
and
less
ambitious
subjects
he
would
undoubtedly
have
succeeded
in
forming
quite
a
collection
the
greater
part
of
his
studies
are
graceful
in
composition
harmonious
in
color
tender
and
true
in
sentiment
why
should
not
the
pictures
have
possessed
the
same
qualities
the
main
reason
for
his
failing
to
express
himself
in
art
is
that
he
was
too
much
attracted
by
the
sublime
in
nature
and
that
the
power
to
convey
the
impression
of
sublimity
has
only
been
granted
to
the
greatest
among
artists
in
may
there
came
a
triumphant
letter
from
mary
saying
that
she
had
discovered
the
house
wanted
by
her
father
uniting
in
incredible
perfection
every
one
of
the
conditions
he
had
laid
down
once
being
hard
pressed
to
give
his
consent
to
a
change
of
residence
he
had
playfully
spread
a
plan
of
paris
on
the
table
and
had
stuck
a
pin
in
it
saying
at
the
same
time
when
you
find
me
a
suitable
house
in
this
situation
and
at
that
distance
from
you
i
promise
to
take
it
it
was
considered
as
a
joke
but
mary
now
affirmed
that
the
villa
cl√©matis
was
at
the
exact
distance
from
the
rue
de
la
tour
where
she
lived
that
her
father
had
mentioned
moreover
the
roads
in
the
avenues
leading
from
cl√©matis
to
passy
were
excellent
for
a
velocipede
or
he
could
reach
her
in
a
charming
walk
of
less
than
an
hour
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
by
rail
three
minutes
only
were
required
from
the
station
of
boulogne
to
that
of
passy
the
rent
was
moderate
and
although
higher
than
our
present
one
would
still
be
within
our
means
if
it
were
taken
into
consideration
that
neither
horse
nor
carriage
would
be
necessary
the
villa
was
in
the
parc
des
princes
which
offered
several
advantages
no
shops
or
factories
of
any
kind
being
allowed
within
the
park
its
peacefulness
was
never
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
traffic
the
houses
which
varied
in
sizes
from
the
simple
ordinary
villa
to
the
h√¥tel
or
ch√¢teau
were
each
surrounded
by
a
garden
small
or
large
and
long
avenues
of
fine
trees
so
encircled
the
park
that
its
existence
was
not
much
known
outside
quite
close
to
it
however
was
the
town
of
boulogne
with
its
market
and
shops
and
at
a
distance
of
a
few
minutes
the
de
a
line
of
tramways
one
of
omnibuses
and
the
steamboats
not
very
far
off
cl√©matis
had
a
very
garden
a
recommendation
to
my
husband
but
was
still
sufficiently
isolated
from
the
neighboring
villas
by
their
own
grounds
on
each
side
there
was
a
veranda
looking
over
the
little
garden
and
a
large
balcony
over
the
veranda
the
dining
and
were
divided
by
double
folding
doors
and
both
had
access
to
the
veranda
by
the
low
and
wide
marble
were
surmounted
by
windows
affording
a
sight
of
trees
and
flowers
and
giving
a
most
light
and
cheerful
effect
to
the
rooms
there
were
several
bedrooms
and
under
the
house
vaulted
cellars
to
keep
it
healthy
and
dry
such
was
the
description
sent
us
which
we
found
perfectly
accurate
when
we
visited
the
house
the
very
day
of
our
arrival
at
passy
on
june
the
diary
says
about
it
went
to
boulogne
to
see
the
villa
cl√©matis
on
the
whole
pleased
with
it
as
for
me
i
was
charmed
with
it
after
all
the
inconveniences
i
had
had
to
put
up
with
hitherto
in
our
rough
country
houses
we
had
been
told
that
the
rents
were
low
at
billancourt
and
we
went
there
to
ascertain
but
we
did
not
like
the
horrid
state
of
the
roads
nor
the
unfinished
streets
the
result
of
all
over
the
place
we
also
saw
vanves
and
the
ch√¢teau
in
which
there
were
two
pavilions
to
let
gilbert
fancy
was
so
much
taken
by
one
of
them
that
i
began
to
dread
he
might
want
to
live
in
it
he
wrote
in
the
diary
the
place
seemed
curious
and
romantic
three
very
fine
lofty
rooms
a
number
of
small
ones
plenty
of
space
not
much
convenience
wife
not
at
all
pleased
with
it
it
would
have
been
much
worse
than
anything
i
had
experienced
before
the
house
was
dark
being
surrounded
and
by
a
small
but
dense
park
climbing
up
an
eminence
above
it
all
the
rainwater
coming
down
this
slope
remained
in
stagnant
pools
about
the
lower
story
the
stones
of
which
were
of
a
dull
and
dirty
green
being
covered
with
moss
there
was
a
queer
circuitous
kitchen
round
the
base
of
the
stairs
and
the
dishes
prepared
in
it
would
have
had
to
be
carried
up
the
stairs
through
an
outside
passage
before
arriving
on
the
table
then
i
wondered
how
the
fine
lofty
rooms
damp
with
moisture
and
cold
with
tiled
floors
could
be
warmed
in
winter
and
also
lighted
for
they
all
looked
upon
the
hill
rising
up
hardly
a
few
feet
from
the
windows
all
that
was
nothing
to
gilbert
who
only
saw
in
perspective
so
many
spacious
studios
and
workrooms
at
last
i
noticed
that
a
paved
road
wound
round
the
outside
of
the
pavilion
and
just
as
i
was
pointing
it
out
there
came
several
heavily
laden
carts
thundering
along
and
shaking
the
whole
building
quite
perceptibly
my
husband
had
enough
of
it
after
that
and
i
rejoiced
inwardly
at
the
opportune
appearance
of
those
carts
the
day
after
the
diary
says
went
in
the
afternoon
to
s√®vres
found
the
place
divided
into
two
parts
the
lower
which
smells
badly
and
the
upper
which
is
all
but
inaccessible
being
up
a
steep
hill
renounced
s√®vres
besides
looking
about
for
a
house
we
went
frequently
to
the
salons
there
being
two
now
and
my
husband
regularly
continued
his
work
seeley
wrote
the
quickness
with
which
your
letters
come
gives
me
a
pleasant
feeling
as
regards
the
future
to
my
inexpressible
delight
cl√©matis
was
chosen
for
our
future
abode
after
other
fruitless
researches
indeed
in
my
opinion
it
was
impossible
to
find
anything
better
suited
to
our
wants
and
what
sounds
almost
incredible
the
situation
of
the
parc
des
princes
was
found
to
be
exactly
where
gilbert
had
pricked
the
pin
in
the
plan
of
paris
the
little
garden
looked
very
pretty
now
in
june
with
the
pillars
of
the
veranda
all
blue
with
flowers
of
the
climbing
clematis
and
the
cornice
loaded
with
the
pink
and
white
bouquets
of
roses
the
wild
clematis
virginia
creeper
and
honeysuckle
clothed
the
trunks
of
every
tree
whilst
their
roots
were
hidden
by
flowers
and
ferns
of
various
kinds
another
pleasant
feature
of
the
park
was
the
quantity
of
singing
birds
there
were
larks
blackcaps
and
blackbirds
no
doubt
attracted
by
the
security
and
peace
they
enjoyed
all
the
year
round
no
shooting
being
allowed
either
in
the
park
or
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
my
husband
wished
to
appropriate
all
the
upper
story
of
cl√©matis
to
his
work
so
as
to
have
within
easy
reach
everything
he
wanted
for
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
escape
from
all
household
noises
the
large
middle
room
with
the
balcony
would
be
his
study
and
atelier
only
he
required
more
light
for
painting
and
a
tall
window
was
made
for
him
one
of
the
small
rooms
was
to
be
a
laboratory
the
other
a
sort
of
storeroom
for
papers
panels
frames
canvases
colors
and
one
of
the
garrets
a
joiner
shop
bookcases
were
to
be
placed
against
all
the
walls
of
the
studio
which
would
serve
as
a
library
at
the
same
time

honorary
last
journey
to
society
of
illness
and
death
we
were
no
sooner
home
again
than
the
transformation
of
my
study
and
laboratory
furniture
began
he
had
carefully
taken
all
the
necessary
measurements
and
he
now
set
two
joiners
to
work
under
his
direction
of
course
we
had
some
months
of
discomfort
and
fatigue
with
the
packing
up
and
the
sale
which
preceded
our
departure
at
one
time
i
was
almost
in
despair
of
ever
getting
through
gilbert
being
so
very
exacting
about
the
packing
that
we
had
to
wrap
up
each
single
book
separately
and
to
fold
up
carefully
every
sheet
or
bit
of
paper
without
creases
it
was
one
of
his
characteristics
this
respectful
care
he
took
of
books
and
papers
it
went
so
far
that
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
destroy
and
when
he
had
not
quite
filled
a
page
with
his
writing
he
would
cut
off
the
white
piece
and
lay
it
aside
in
a
drawer
for
further
use
nay
more
after
making
use
of
these
fragments
of
paper
for
notes
which
had
been
copied
out
he
drew
a
line
of
red
or
blue
pencil
across
the
writing
and
returned
the
paper
to
another
drawer
to
be
used
the
other
and
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
economy
for
he
was
frequently
indulging
in
the
purchase
of
etc
no
it
was
a
sort
of
instinctive
respect
if
any
one
held
a
book
carelessly
or
let
it
fall
he
was
absolutely
miserable
and
could
not
refrain
from
remonstrating
when
we
unpacked
he
directed
a
man
to
fold
up
the
papers
which
had
been
used
as
wrappers
and
when
i
told
him
that
the
papers
were
not
worth
the
man
wages
and
had
better
be
thrown
into
the
street
he
looked
surprised
and
reluctantly
allowed
them
to
be
stuffed
into
the
empty
boxes
but
be
could
not
bring
himself
to
remain
while
it
was
being
done
it
was
hard
to
break
away
from
the
associations
of
so
many
years
and
the
last
meal
we
took
in
the
emptied
of
all
its
furniture
except
a
small
table
and
two
chairs
was
a
melancholy
one
i
swallowed
many
a
tear
and
gilbert
voice
was
somewhat
tremulous
when
he
attempted
to
talk
roberts
brothers
had
inquired
early
in
the
year
if
hamerton
had
decided
about
a
new
book
and
had
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
they
now
said
we
hasten
to
reply
to
your
query
yes
we
think
quest
of
happiness
an
admirable
title
for
a
book
destined
for
the
popular
heart
so
happy
that
it
will
of
itself
sell
it
do
meditate
about
doing
it
too
long
and
black
had
also
proposed
that
hamerton
articles
for
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
should
be
revised
and
enlarged
so
as
to
make
an
interesting
and
valuable
to
drawing
and
engraving
and
the
author
had
agreed
to
undertake
the
work
they
were
so
considerate
as
to
send
a
copy
of
the
encyclopaedia
to
the
writer
who
had
long
desired
to
possess
it
and
who
valued
it
as
a
treasure
he
had
a
special
bookcase
made
for
it
with
many
divisions
to
preserve
the
volumes
from
too
much
rubbing
and
was
pleased
with
their
handsome
appearance
in
his
library
a
letter
received
in
the
autumn
may
offer
some
interest
to
the
reader
it
tells
of
a
rather
curious
occurrence
the
writer
had
been
occasionally
in
correspondence
with
the
author
of
wenderholme
and
living
in
lancashire
had
greatly
appreciated
the
accuracy
of
the
descriptions
and
characters
in
that
locality
two
years
before
he
had
discovered
thursday
and
under
his
guidance
had
visited
the
site
of
the
first
camp
at
widdup
and
noted
the
changes
now
he
wrote
again
giving
an
account
of
his
experiences
during
a
little
visit
to
the
bront√´
country
and
explaining
at
some
length
that
he
was
driven
by
bad
weather
to
the
you
will
remember
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
used
in
the
district
occupied
by
the
wrangling
drunkard
the
talk
turning
upon
a
hut
which
had
been
erected
by
a
through
halifax
for
the
evoked
a
reminiscence
from
the
only
relatively
sober
member
of
the
party
of
another
mon
a
hartist
who
aboon
thirty
year
sin
built
a
hut
at
widdup
and
hed
a
gurt
big
dog
and
young
helliwell
ower
at
jerusalem
wor
then
a
lad
and
used
to
bring
him
the
mon
milk
and
in
the
end
gat
on
as
sarvant
and
went
wi
him
to
scotland
and
all
ower
you
may
imagine
my
delight
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
thursday
was
not
in
very
good
health
he
is
however
married
and
the
proud
father
of
a
little
girl
mary
alice
he
seems
very
comfortable
and
has
promised
me
a
photograph
of
himself
by
way
of
a
frontispiece
to
my
copy
of
the
camp
i
trust
i
am
not
boring
you
but
i
thought
that
you
might
like
to
know
that
you
and
your
encampment
are
still
remembered
in
the
district
it
always
pleased
gilbert
to
have
news
of
the
people
and
places
associated
in
his
mind
and
affections
with
his
youth
and
his
interest
in
them
never
grew
cold
with
years
our
new
installation
at
cl√©matis
was
much
simplified
by
the
fact
that
everything
from
la
tuilerie
had
been
sent
in
advance
in
order
not
to
keep
gilbert
too
long
from
his
work
the
study
was
first
arranged
and
he
was
well
pleased
with
it
indeed
he
said
he
had
never
been
so
conveniently
or
comfortably
established
for
his
work
before
but
still
i
saw
with
pain
that
he
looked
depressed
in
spite
of
himself
new
year
day
saw
us
established
in
the
new
house
and
regular
habits
of
work
resumed
having
two
spare
bedrooms
our
children
came
to
use
them
during
the
christmas
holidays
and
we
had
some
pleasant
meetings
with
pelletier
and
his
family
it
was
by
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
that
almost
every
sunday
we
lunched
in
turn
at
each
other
houses
once
at
cl√©matis
then
at
madame
halliard
and
afterwards
at
pelletier
after
lunch
we
had
a
long
walk
either
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
parc
de
st
cloud
jardin
du
luxembourg
or
jardin
des
plantes
but
although
gilbert
enjoyed
these
strolls
they
did
not
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
country
neither
did
the
seine
replace
the
sa√¥ne
and
seeley
said
i
am
sorry
the
seine
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
you
will
miss
your
old
amusement
of
sailing
for
which
steaming
will
be
a
poor
substitute
we
all
tried
to
find
something
that
might
take
his
fancy
and
we
went
to
see
the
marne
he
said
it
afforded
refreshing
and
pretty
scenes
but
he
was
not
enthusiastic
about
its
character
i
plainly
saw
that
what
i
had
feared
had
come
to
pass
namely
that
this
new
way
of
life
did
not
suit
him
so
well
as
the
old
and
that
despite
the
greater
facilities
he
did
not
seem
to
work
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
felt
dull
this
lasted
for
some
time
seeley
humorously
teased
him
about
it
and
suggested
that
he
should
write
for
an
american
magazine
an
article
on
the
dulness
of
paris
he
went
on
if
you
could
only
run
over
here
to
roam
about
our
kentish
hills
you
would
soon
be
all
right
again
they
are
covered
with
millions
of
wood
anemones
violets
primroses
cuckoo
flowers
and
and
the
low
ground
is
gay
with
alas
the
bois
offered
all
this
in
profusion
but
for
flowers
gilbert
never
really
cared
he
merely
appreciated
their
in
the
harmony
of
a
landscape
he
thus
explained
his
feelings
in
answer
to
seeley
my
complaints
about
the
dulness
of
paris
refer
to
the
peculiar
state
of
mind
the
place
always
induces
in
myself
that
is
now
the
state
of
mind
is
the
worst
possible
for
a
writer
because
his
interest
in
things
ought
always
to
remain
keen
and
lively
he
ought
to
have
the
intelligence
of
a
man
with
the
interest
of
a
child
i
believe
paris
to
be
on
the
whole
the
most
endurable
of
great
cities
that
in
which
the
disagreeables
of
such
places
are
most
successfully
palliated
for
instance
i
can
go
from
here
to
the
louvre
in
magnificent
avenues
all
the
way
but
for
a
writer
it
is
not
enough
to
find
life
endurable
he
ought
to
be
keenly
interested
my
life
at
autun
was
pleasant
and
refreshing
at
loch
awe
it
was
an
enchantment
however
i
did
not
come
here
for
my
pleasure
and
work
was
crowding
upon
him
besides
man
in
art
which
had
been
put
aside
since
the
interruption
necessitated
by
the
removal
the
editor
of
the
forum
walter
page
asked
for
an
article
on
the
effects
on
popular
education
of
great
art
collections
he
said
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
some
of
the
best
american
newspapers
have
discussed
your
article
on
the
of
languages
and
that
i
have
many
evidences
of
the
appreciation
of
a
large
number
of
our
most
cultivated
people
the
editor
of
the
illustrated
london
news
also
wished
for
a
series
of
articles
on
french
life
and
was
very
sorry
that
hamerton
could
not
undertake
them
for
want
of
time
and
the
publisher
of
the
portfolio
would
have
been
pleased
to
get
reviews
of
the
annual
salons
from
the
editor
pen
early
in
the
spring
as
soon
as
the
weather
permitted
it
we
began
to
go
regularly
with
and
mme
raillard
to
the
prettiest
places
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
to
spend
the
thursdays
and
sundays
we
were
frequently
joined
by
the
pelletier
family
and
had
picnics
together
in
sheltered
nooks
we
started
early
in
the
morning
carried
our
provisions
with
the
exception
of
beer
wine
and
bread
which
could
always
be
bought
anywhere
and
roamed
about
or
rested
till
the
end
of
the
day
in
this
pleasant
and
independent
manner
we
saw
germain
the
forest
and
ch√¢teau
by
which
my
husband
was
much
impressed
the
lakes
and
bois
de
vincennes
the
park
at
marly
the
mills
of
meaux
r√©my
the
ch√¢teau

the
ponds
at
garches
des
melun
and
de
cucufa
with
its
surroundings
of
luxuriant
vegetation
and
noble
trees
these
walks
in
the
country
much
more
of
the
real
country
than
my
husband
had
ever
expected
to
find
so
near
paris
began
to
reconcile
him
to
his
new
life
but
what
helped
most
towards
this
reconciliation
was
the
bois
de
boulogne
with
its
hidden
charms
and
beauties
which
he
had
the
pleasure
of
discovering
for
himself
never
having
heard
of
them
for
the
parts
of
the
bois
best
known
and
always
offered
to
admiration
are
the
most
artificial
and
the
resorts
of
fashion
equipages
and
crowds
the
cascade
the
lakes
the
all√©e
des
acacias
the
and
la
grande
pelouse
while
there
are
enough
solitary
nooks
and
unfrequented
alleys
thick
underwoods
open
vistas
and
groups
of
graceful
and
handsome
trees
to
interest
a
lover
of
landscape
for
miles
and
miles
without
any
other
disturbance
than
a
chance
meeting
with
a
timid
rabbit
or
a
curious
deer
no
sooner
had
gilbert
found
out
that
there
existed
in
the
bois
real
and
extensive
woodland
scenery
almost
untrodden
and
unexplored
than
it
became
a
pleasure
to
start
on
his
tricycle
followed
by
his
dog
for
an
early
ride
under
the
dewy
branches
in
the
light
and
fragrant
mist
rising
from
the
moist
mosses
and
under
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
from
these
healthy
rides
he
returned
to
his
first
much
exhilarated
having
breathed
fresh
air
without
the
sensation
of
confinement
so
painful
to
him
gradually
he
came
across
various
scenes
which
he
felt
attracted
to
paint
and
then
his
liking
for
the
bois
was
formed
there
were
among
others
la
mare
the
incomparable
group
of
grand
old
oaks
a
single
branch
of
which
would
have
made
a
fine
tree
the
ponds
of
boulogne
the
varied
views
of
the
seine
with
the
gay
and
sunny
slopes
from
the
walks
running
parallel
to
the
river
then
the
mill
and
its
surrounding
fields
quiet
at
times
with
browsing
cows
in
the
rich
grass
or
at
other
times
alive
with
merry
mowers
and
several
views
of
mont
val√©rien
looming
in
the
haze
of
the
or
in
dark
contrast
with
the
splendor
of
the
afternoon
sunshine
also
caught
my
husband
attention
as
well
as
numberless
other
places
without
a
name
which
pleased
him
for
one
sort
of
beauty
or
another
after
each
new
discovery
he
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
to
see
and
whenever
it
was
possible
and
at
a
walking
distance
from
the
house
i
took
a
book
with
me
and
read
to
him
as
he
sketched
by
a
few
notes
in
the
diary
it
will
be
seen
that
his
explorations
extended
to
rather
long
distances
from
the
house
went
to
on
the
tricycle
found
capital
place
for
studying
boats
not
far
from
the
pont
went
round
by
bois
to
rothschild
till
i
came
to
bridge
of
st
cloud
and
to
the
house
lovely
play
of
lights
on
the
water
and
upon
the
heights
in
afternoon
rode
as
far
as
argenteuil
and
saw

establishment
there
and
the
fleet
of
went
to

a
on
the
road
managed
i
believe
by
caran
etc
when
he
had
regained
the
elasticity
of
his
mind
his
thoughts
were
turned
again
to
his
important
work
note
in
the
diary
on
march
tried
to
recover
command
of
in
art
putting
the
in
order
read
the
chapters
over
again
to
recover
materials
and
spirit
of
work
from
that
date
man
in
art
was
steadily
resumed
till
its
completion
there
was
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
disappointment
with
the
illustrations
some
of
which
were
found
unworthy
of
insertion
but
having
been
ordered
they
would
have
to
be
paid
for
the
author
was
ready
to
bear
the
cost
rather
than
see
them
inserted
but
macmillan
very
kindly
and
generously
refused
to
allow
this
and
proposed
that
he
should
send
a
bill
for
any
money
that
he
should
find
it
necessary
to
expend
on
unsatisfactory
illustrations
my
husband
was
now
in
far
better
spirits
and
apparently
in
very
good
health
a
friend
oliver
who
had
named
his
son
hamerton
out
of
admiration
for
the
author
wrote
in
answer
to
one
of
his
letters
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
you
find
the
later
period
of
life
not
unattended
with
deep
satisfaction
and
pleasure
among
those
pleasures
were
the
friendly
or
interesting
visits
that
the
remoteness
of
autun
from
great
centres
would
have
effectually
prevented
in
the
spring
we
saw
macmillan
and
her
son
in
the
autumn
we
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
and
adam
black
who
were
passing
through
paris
and
with
whom
we
spent
an
afternoon
visiting
the
gardens
and
ruins
of
st
cloud
roberts
brothers
to
whom
many
applications
for
letters
of
introduction
were
addressed
and
who
managed
to
give
only
a
few
sent
some
of
their
friends
to
hamerton
now
and
then
they
said
in
one
of
their
letters
since
you
will
not
come
to
america
and
see
for
yourself
we
want
to
show
you
that
our
aborigines
are
as
good
specimens
of
the
as
they
make
anywhere
in
the
parc
des
princes
lives
a
great
artist
urrabieta
vierge
whose
house
and
studio
were
only
a
few
minutes
distant
from
cl√©matis
hamerton
admiration
of
this
artist
talent
was
great
and
his
liking
for
him
as
a
man
became
great
also
he
often
expressed
the
opinion
that
in
his
best
urrabieta
vierge
was
and
would
remain
without
a
rival
he
used
to
spend
hours
over
the
original
illustrations
to
pablo
de
segovie
and
other
drawings
in
the
possession
of
the
artist
hardly
ever
did
a
day
pass
without
seeing
my
husband
in
vierge
studio
once
at
least
he
had
opportunities
of
rendering
him
a
service
sometimes
as
the
artist
had
dealings
with
english
and
american
publishers
but
was
ignorant
of
their
language
and
in
token
of
gratitude
vierge
painted
his
new
friend
portrait
and
also
that
of
his
madame
gindriez
the
idea
of
a
book
on
the
study
of
words
to
be
written
in
collaboration
with
raillard
had
not
been
abandoned
by
my
husband
who
submitted
the
title
for
seeley
approval
it
was
to
be
words
on
their
travels
and
some
words
it
was
pronounced
lively
and
interesting
his
own
share
had
been
delayed
but
his
was
working
at
it
and
they
carefully
planned
together
the
composition
and
form
of
the
book
the
separate
parts
of
which
were
to
be
linked
together
by
essays
from
my
husband
pen
much
time
was
devoted
to
the
exhibitions
in
the
salons
of
course
had
many
visits
but
they
did
not
give
so
much
pleasure
to
gilbert
as
les
cent
or
the
pelouse
exhibition
he
was
also
greatly
interested
by
raffet
works
our
children
spent
with
us
a
month
of
the
long
vacation
as
they
used
to
do
at
and
our
excursions
to
the
most
picturesque
places
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
became
more
frequent
we
had
formed
a
project
for
going
to
and
compi√®gne
but
my
husband
being
now
most
anxious
to
finish
man
in
art
before
christmas
regretfully
put
off
the
excursions
to
the
ensuing
year
now
that
he
had
regained
the
buoyancy
of
his
spirits
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
peculiar
charms
of
the
country
about
paris
and
even
intended
to
write
a
series
of
small
books
on
the
most
noteworthy
and
remarkable
places
something
in
the
way
of
exhaustive
guides
he
thought
of
beginning
with
those
that
he
knew
thoroughly
well
already
and
to
acquaint
himself
gradually
with
the
others
in
september
our
with
his
wife
went
to
stay
with
his
parents
for
the
remainder
of
the
vacation
but
mary
left
them
a
few
days
before
her
husband
to
see
her
relatives
at
chalon
and
in
the
way
of
consolation
her
father
sent
the
following
to
raoul
beatus
ille
blest
is
the
man
whose
wife
is
gone
away
from
cares
exempt
he
dwells
in
perfect
peace
his
heart
is
light
as
boy
on
holiday
he
walks
abroad
and
joys
in
his
release
the
cat
is
gone
the
frisky
mouse
doth
play
the
fox
remote
walk
forth
the
wandering
geese
so
he
delivered
thinks
his
troubles
past
o
halcyon
days
if
they
could
only
last
to
ever
since
he
had
heard
of
lord
tennyson
illness
my
husband
had
been
greatly
concerned
and
never
missed
going
every
evening
to
the
auteuil
railway
station
for
the
latest
news
after
the
death
of
the
poet
he
wrote
to
seeley
one
must
die
some
time
but
it
is
still
rather
saddening
to
know
that
tennyson
is
no
longer
a
living
poet
i
have
always
enjoyed
his
verse
very
much
the
art
is
so
perfect
so
superior
to
that
of
browning
or
wordsworth
even
to
that
of
byron
i
know
of
no
poet
to
equal
tennyson
in
finish
except
shelley
keats
and
horace
and
those
three
only
in
gems
in
a
letter
to
miss
he
had
said
once
have
you
observed
how
careful
tennyson
has
always
been
never
to
publish
prose
that
was
capital
policy
in
his
case
he
seems
so
much
more
the
poet
to
the
world
outside
seeley
was
anxious
to
confer
with
the
editor
of
the
portfolio
about
plans
for
the
following
year
but
he
had
considerately
refrained
from
mentioning
it
so
long
as
the
large
book
was
not
announced
for
publication
in
the
beginning
of
october
however
he
wrote
i
see
that
macmillans
announce
your
big
book
so
i
suppose
that
labor
is
off
your
hands
then
he
went
on
to
propose
that
the
editor
should
write
a
series
of
articles
on
the
humorous
art
of
the
present
day
and
my
husband
took
time
to
think
about
the
subject
the
last
sheets
of
man
in
art
were
sent
off
on
october
and
after
acknowledging
their
receipt
macmillan
said
with
regard
to
the
drawings
on
glass
i
write
to
say
that
we
are
perfectly
willing
that
as
you
suggest
you
should
make
a
present
of
them
to
the
art
school
of
burnley
in
lancashire
the
same
applies
to
the
original
engraved
by
pierre
gusman
our
november
journey
to
london
was
unattended
with
troubles
to
my
husband
health
and
it
was
with
unalloyed
pleasure
that
we
met
and
seeley
again
our
stay
was
to
be
a
short
one
for
it
had
been
decided
that
in
the
future
we
would
come
over
at
least
once
every
year
and
more
probably
twice
here
is
the
first
letter
after
our
arrival
london
my
dear
mary
i
have
some
good
news
to
tell
you
my
new
book
is
not
out
yet
but
soon
will
be
it
is
in
two
editions
one
large
paper
and
dear
the
other
smaller
paper
and
much
lower
in
price
the
first
is
exhausted
before
publication
and
the
second
without
being
exhausted
yet
is
still
going
off
well
i
dined
last
night
with
macmillan
and
they
seemed
quite
satisfied
seeley
has
just
offered
to
publish
my
next
novel
i
was
glad
to
get
a
from
raoul
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
work
with
him
perhaps
however
we
shall
quarrel
over
our
book
and
never
speak
to
each
other
again
but
his
will
love
him
still
whatever
happens
your
very
affectionate
old
father
g
hamerton
the
work
that
my
husband
had
to
do
was
easily
gone
through
and
his
nervous
system
had
so
much
improved
that
he
went
alone
about
london
without
any
forebodings
without
even
thinking
about
it
except
to
remark
to
me
sometimes
that
he
had
never
expected
such
an
improvement
had
it
not
been
for
a
very
slight
and
short
attack
of
gout
he
would
have
been
perfectly
well
all
the
time
and
seeley
were
then
living
in
kensington
and
it
was
very
convenient
for
my
husband
the
situation
being
quiet
and
within
easy
reach
of
the
museums
although
the
season
was
not
favorable
for
going
to
the
country
our
friends
knew
that
their
visitor
would
be
pleased
to
escape
from
london
were
it
only
for
a
day
or
two
and
they
were
so
kind
as
to
take
us
to
their
pretty
cottage
at
shoreham
in
kent
and
to
show
us
the
country
surrounding
it
gilbert
was
out
walking
most
of
the
time
and
there
being
hills
and
water
wished
he
had
time
for
sketching
though
he
told
me
he
would
not
like
to
live
there
permanently
the
country
not
being
sufficiently
open
for
his
tastes
the
new
arrangements
for
the
portfolio
having
been
decided
upon
my
husband
wrote
to
tell
mary
of
our
near
arrival
in
this
letter
he
said
in
spite
of
the
great
kindness
we
meet
with
here
i
do
feel
any
desire
to
live
in
or
near
london
it
is
so
gloomy
and
dirty
besides
being
so
expensive
at
least
according
to
present
customs
of
living
we
are
better
where
we
are
near
you
i
am
very
glad
that
raoul
likes
the
idea
of
our
book
i
believe
we
can
work
out
together
something
decidedly
new
and
valuable
in
the
course
of
a
visit
to
a
black
she
gave
us
good
and
interesting
news
of
her
cousin
stevenson
and
showed
us
a
photograph
taken
inside
his
house
at
samoa
in
which
he
was
seen
surrounded
by
his
mother
his
wife
his
wife
children
and
his
native
servants
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
him
looking
happy
and
so
much
stronger
than
he
used
to
be
macmillan
though
very
feeble
was
so
kind
as
to
receive
us
we
were
for
leaving
him
soon
fearing
that
he
would
be
fatigued
but
he
insisted
upon
our
remaining
and
brightened
wonderfully
as
he
talked
with
my
husband
he
ordered
glasses
and
wine
and
drank
to
our
healths
with
such
hearty
and
pressed
our
hands
at
parting
so
affectionately
that
we
were
quite
moved
he
had
been
such
a
strong
and
active
man
and
there
was
still
such
an
expression
of
power
and
will
in
his
countenance
that
to
see
him
an
invalid
unable
to
walk
without
help
was
inexpressibly
pitiful
he
had
said
not
without
sadness
that
he
had
grown
resigned
to
this
trying
bodily
weakness
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
a
great
dread
of
the
weakness
reaching
the
seat
of
thought
some
day
it
was
the
last
time
we
saw
him
though
he
lived
some
years
longer
and
we
liked
ever
after
to
recall
his
last
kind
greeting
as
warm
as
those
of
former
days
raillard
and
his
wife
received
us
joyfully
on
our
arrival
in
paris
we
were
all
greatly
cheered
by
the
fact
that
my
husband
could
now
travel
like
everybody
else
and
this
feeling
of
security
gave
a
great
stimulus
to
his
energies
we
were
often
planning
journeys
to
places
of
interest
that
it
might
be
useful
for
him
to
visit
either
for
his
artistic
studies
or
for
literary
work
the
countess
martinengo
cesaresco
with
whom
he
had
long
been
in
correspondence
had
invited
us
to
go
to
see
her
on
the
lake
of
garda
and
this
was
a
great
temptation
to
which
he
hoped
to
yield
some
day
meanwhile
we
planned
for
the
autumn
a
visit
to
lucerne
in
which
our
son
and
daughter
and
her
husband
would
join
and
we
often
talked
about
it
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
very
few
of
our
schemes
could
ever
be
carried
out
but
i
encouraged
the
discussion
of
them
for
even
that
gave
pleasure
to
gilbert
who
had
been
kept
sedentary
so
long
he
told
us
what
he
would
do
and
what
he
would
attempt
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
his
desire
for
beautiful
natural
scenes
was
so
intense
that
he
often
dreamt
he
was
towards
them
and
afterwards
described
his
sensations
the
recurrence
of
this
sensation
of
over
space
caused
him
some
slight
alarm
for
he
explained
that
doctors
considered
it
as
a
symptom
of
disturbed
equilibrium
in
the
system
which
they
called
levitation
still
he
was
now
almost
in
perfect
health
indeed
he
did
not
remember
the
time
when
he
had
been
so
well
so
ready
for
work
or
enjoying
it
more
he
said
he
was
almost
afraid
it
seemed
so
strange
in
a
letter
from
roberts
brothers
dated
march
i
read
we
are
indeed
pleased
to
hear
that
quest
of
happiness
is
likely
to
be
ready
for
this
autumn
and
the
title
is
so
promising
that
we
should
not
wonder
if
it
made
your
larger
this
book
however
was
laid
aside
for
more
pressing
work
the
meissonier
exhibition
was
opened
and
my
husband
who
delighted
in
the
talent
of
the
artist
had
already
gone
there
several
times
when
he
received
a
letter
from
seeley
asking
him
to
notice
it
for
the
portfolio
and
he
assented
then
burlingame
of
the
house
of
scribner
sons
of
new
york
came
over
from
london
for
the
special
purpose
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
hamerton
and
of
proposing
to
him
to
write
a
series
of
twelve
articles
on
modern
representative
painters
for
magazine
the
proposal
was
flattering
in
itself
but
the
pleasure
it
gave
was
singularly
enhanced
by
the
visitor
friendly
courtesy
and
cultured
appreciation
after
two
meetings
only
burlingame
had
to
leave
paris
and
my
husband
spoke
regretfully
of
the
shortness
of
a
visit
he
had
so
much
enjoyed
and
expressed
a
wish
that
an
opportunity
for
more
prolonged
intercourse
might
present
itself
before
long
judging
from
burlingame
letter
the
pleasure
had
been
mutual
i
quote
a
passage
out
of
it
i
use
my
earliest
opportunity
to
jot
down
a
note
for
our
better
remembrance
of
the
main
points
of
the
arrangement
for
magazine
by
assenting
to
which
you
gave
me
such
pleasure
in
paris
i
sail
on
saturday
and
assure
you
i
shall
carry
home
no
pleasanter
recollection
than
that
of
the
two
days
which
you
made
very
enjoyable
for
me
at
paris
and
boulogne
the
scheme
did
not
require
much
literary
labor
but
it
involved
careful
researches
for
the
choice
of
subjects
delicate
negotiations
with
the
owners
of
the
pictures
chosen
to
obtain
the
right
of
reproduction
and
moreover
a
superintendence
of
these
reproductions
as
to
quality
after
giving
due
consideration
to
the
subject
of
humor
in
painting
for
the
portfolio
the
editor
did
not
feel
inclined
to
undertake
it
but
in
his
frequent
walks
about
paris
his
attention
had
been
forcibly
attracted
by
the
invention
and
fancy
shown
in
the
designs
of
modern
houses
and
that
was
a
study
quite
congenial
to
his
tastes
and
a
subject
on
which
he
was
thoroughly
competent
to
write
it
was
proposed
to
seeley
who
accepted
it
and
from
that
moment
we
haunted
the
quarters
in
which
new
buildings
were
rising
as
if
by
magic
in
the
purity
of
the
white
stone
used
in
paris
and
in
the
richness
or
delicacy
of
their
carvings
and
mosaics
besides
these
various
preparations
for
future
work
hamerton
had
been
much
occupied
by
annotating
a
collection
of
different
things
intended
as
a
present
to
the
mechanics
institution
of
burnley
shortly
after
sending
it
off
he
received
the
warm
thanks
of
the
council
through
its
secretary
the
search
after
suitable
subjects
for
scribner
magazine
had
only
yielded
an
insufficient
number
and
my
husband
decided
to
go
to
london
in
july
to
complete
his
list
he
felt
so
well
that
the
idea
of
undertaking
the
journey
alone
did
not
make
him
apprehensive
in
the
least
not
so
with
me
and
my
anxiety
was
only
calmed
after
receiving
the
assurance
that
he
had
felt
perfectly
comfortable
the
whole
way
his
daughter
wrote
to
him

i
was
in
the
academy
yesterday
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
feel
perfectly
well
and
not
in
the
least
fatigued
by
my
journey
from
which
i
experienced
no
inconvenience
whatever
except
an
increased
appetite
which
has
remained
with
me
ever
since
shortly
after
my
husband
return
from
london
jaccaci
an
american
artist
and
author
and
a
devoted
friend
of
vierge
came
to
see
us
and
gilbert
interest
in
him
was
quickly
awakened
i
was
told
that
he
had
travelled
much
and
though
still
young
could
speak
eight
languages
there
was
a
first
bond
between
them
in
their
admiration
of
vierge
talent
and
in
their
sympathy
for
his
individuality
they
met
several
times
at
his
studio
unfortunately
jaccaci
stay
was
of
short
duration
and
he
was
extremely
busy
so
much
so
indeed
that
he
could
not
accept
an
invitation
but
promised
to
do
so
next
time
he
came
to
paris
his
departure
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
friendly
intercourse
which
was
carried
on
by
correspondence
at
the
first
appearance
of
the
portfolio
it
had
taken
an
entirely
new
line
among
english
periodicals
but
now
there
were
two
other
art
magazines
similar
in
character
and
style
of
illustration
and
both
its
editor
and
publisher
were
desirous
of
an
alteration
which
would
once
more
distinguish
it
from
similar
periodicals
they
considered
how
it
might
be
remodelled
so
as
to
give
it
a
new
character
of
its
own
and
at
last
taking
into
consideration
the
prejudice
which
had
set
in
against
big
books
they
decided
to
reduce
its
size
and
to
increase
the
letterpress
considerably
each
number
was
to
be
devoted
to
one
subject
and
written
by
the
same
author
so
as
to
be
complete
in
itself
the
new
second
title
monographs
on
artistic
subjects
was
liked
by
many
critics
and
one
of
them
said
monographs
i
wonder
whose
idea
that
was
what
an
admirable
plan
strange
that
no
one
ever
thought
of
it
before
the
editor
undertook
to
write
the
first
number
on
the
etchings
of
rembrandt
but
in
spite
of
his
enthusiasm
for
the
subject
and
his
thorough
knowledge
of
it
he
felt
painfully
hurried
for
the
decision
had
been
taken
somewhat
late
in
the
year
he
told
me
he
would
have
liked
to
devote
six
months
to
its
preparation
still
the
new
plan
gave
him
much
pleasant
anticipation
of
carefully
prepared
work
as
he
disliked
devoting
his
time
to
subjects
of
minor
importance
a
number
of
the
portfolio
now
allowed
of
a
worthy
subject
being
worthily
treated
and
that
was
in
accordance
with
my
husband
preferred
method
of
work

the
ordinary
autumnal

time
in

had
made
the

had
hoped
that
it
might
grow
into
closer

we
learned
that
they
had
been
mistaken

in

received
this
reply
to

of

alas
prevented
another
meeting
for
darmesteter
who
was
already
in
weak
health
did
not
live
very
long
after
seeley
thought
the
monograph
on
rembrandt
lively
charmingly
written
and
betraying
no
sign
of
hurry
this
opinion
was
shared
by
the
public
for
the
sale
of
the
portfolio
increased
largely
indeed
the
new
scheme
was
generally
applauded
and
many
letters
were
sent
both
to
the
editor
and
to
the
publisher
in
token
of
appreciation
sir
burton
to
whom
my
husband
had
applied
for
a
monograph
on

said
in
his
reply
i
have
seen
the
in
its
new
form
and
i
think
the
alterations
you
have
made
in
the
plan
and
scope
of
the
work
most
happily
inspired
sir

also
wrote

i

the
change
a
wise
one
in

ways
it

the

it
will
be
a
far
handier
shape
for
the
but
i
feel
a
well
perhaps
sentimental
regret
for
the
old
it
seems
like
the
disappearance
of
on
old
familiar
friend
although
we
know
he
is
still
alive

it

sketches
for

went

took

on

we
were

of
the
great
affection
we
bore
to
the
bride
my
husband
put
this
note
in
the
diary
wedding
passed
off
very
well
beautiful
ceremony
in
chapel
i
had
a
talk
with
loyson
brother
of
hyacinthe
loyson
great
numbers
of
people
to
congratulate
gilbert
had
long
talks
on
architecture
with
his
to
whom
he
showed
several
of
the
new
buildings
he
had
been
studying
for
his
parisian
houses
particularly
in
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
avenue
bugeaud
and
rue
de
longchamp
when
gindriez
left
gilbert
tried
to
resume
the
quest
of
happiness
but
told
me
he
had
determined
to
remodel
the
prologue
on
positive
and
negative
happiness
because
he
had
thought
out
a
scheme
of
alteration
i
was
very
sorry
to
hear
of
it
because
the
work
was
already
so
far
advanced
and
the
alterations
would
require
so
much
trouble
and
time
but
such
considerations
had
no
weight
with
him
when
he
thought
his
work
could
be
improved
so
i
kept
my
disappointment
to
myself
some
time
in
february
my
husband
had
received
a
letter
from
sir
reid
from
which
i
quote
the
following
passage
i
have
little
doubt
that
before
the
month
of
march
comes
you
will
be
hamerton
your
claims
to
such
recognition
have
long
been
beyond
all
questioning
this
was
confirmed
by
the
secretary
of
the
university
of
aberdeen
on
march
in
these
terms
dear
sir
i
have
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
that
the
senatus
of
the
university
at
its
meeting
conferred
upon
you
the
honorary
degree
of
doctor
of
laws
ll
i
am
yours
faithfully
alexander
stewart
secretary
of
the
senatus
three
days
later
lady
reid
wrote
dear
hamerton
we
are
delighted
to
see
in
this
morning
newspaper
the
announcement
of
your
though
we
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
i
feel
almost
as
if
i
had
known
you
for
many
years
your
writings
having
given
me
such
real
pleasure
ever
since
i
first
made
your
acquaintance
in
painter
camp
in
the
highlands
in
i
hope
you
will
kindly
accept
from
me
your
aberdeen
which
is
the
outward
visible
sign
of
your
new
academic
rank
my
husband
says
it
is
chromatic
discord
of
the
order
but
over
the
arrangements
of
such
things
the
present
generation
has
no
control
their
form
and
colors
having
been
settled
long
ago
sir
george
unites
with
me
in
kindest
regards
and
in
the
hope
that
you
may
long
live
to
enjoy
your
most
honors
believe
me
yours
very
truly
mia
reid
shortly
after
sir
george
reid
wrote
you
have
done
so
much
for
the
literature
of
art
that
the
only
wonder
is
your
services
have
not
been
acknowledged
by
one
or
other
of
our
universities
long
ago
i
am
very
glad
that
the
honor
has
come
to
you
from
the
university
of
aberdeen
although
my
husband
cared
little
for
honors
this
recognition
freely
and
spontaneously
conferred
by
the
university
of
aberdeen
without
any
solicitation
on
his
part
gave
him
real
pleasure
he
had
never
expected
anything
in
this
way
from
oxford
or
cambridge
because
he
had
never
been
a
student
of
either
and
he
fancied
that
this
would
always
be
against
him
it
reminds
me
of
what
he
wrote
to
seeley
soon
after
our
arrival
in
paris
when
he
suffered
from
dulness
i
never
was
at
oxford
i
always
had
a
boyish
dread
of
being
sent
there
and
put
into
one
of
the
colleges
i
think
i
was
marked
for
balliol
after
my
escape
i
felt
towards
the
place
much
as
a
sound
protestant
feels
towards
the
vatican
here
is
a
reflection
that
has
sometimes
occurred
to
me
since
my
imprisonment
here
began
me
why
if
i
can
endure
paris
i
might
possibly
have
endured
oxford
after
congratulating
the
editor
of
the
portfolio
on
his
new
title
seeley
said
my
brother
at
cambridge
has
been
made
a
knight
commander
of
michael
and
george
what
an
extraordinary
title
for
a
professor
and
you
are
now
a
doctor
of
laws
will
you
kindly
allow
us
to
consult
you
in
any
legal
difficulty
the
new
doctor
footnote
hamerton
and
professor
seeley
were
born
on
the
same
day
and
there
was
an
interval
of
only
a
few
weeks
between
their
deaths
answered
i
congratulate
you
on
having
a
brother
who
is
a
knight
commander
of
michael
and
george
too
they
were
both
very
valiant
saints
dangerous
to
dragons
and
demons
the
image
that
rose
to
my
mind
eye
when
i
read
your
letter
was
that
of
your
brother
in
shining
golden
armor
riding
full
tilt
with
spear
in
rest
against
a
terrible
dragon
i
wish
lord
shaftesbury
had
lived
to
hear
of
it
for
one
reason
and
your
father
for
another
thank
you
for
your
congratulations
about
my
in
answer
to
your
question
i
beg
to
say
that
whilst
the
degree
is
but
a
just
tribute
to
my
legal
knowledge
it
does
not
confer
the
right
to
practise
so
that
you
would
do
better
to
consult
some
professional
man
such
as
a
barrister
or
an
attorney
even
though
his
legal
attainments
might
be
far
inferior
to
mine
in
the
same
year
hamerton
was
invited
by
the
society
of
illustrators
to
accept
a

with
sir

to

if
my

would
undertake
it
burlingame
letter
explains
the
scheme
dear
hamerton
in
the
course
of
the
publication
of
the
magazine
we
have
printed
from
time
to
time
what
we
believe
to
be
some
of
the
best
american
we
are
going
to
make
a
selection
of
about
forty
of
them
thoroughly
representative
of
the
best
men
and
subjects
though
we
have
not
tried
of
course
to
have
the
representation
and
issue
it
as
soon
as
we
can
in
the
form
of
india
proofs
in
a
portfolio
in
a
very
limited
edition
probably
of
less
than
copies
made
with
the
utmost
care
and
all
possible
accessories
to
render
the
collection
a
standard
one
meaning
to
make
it
represent
the
highest
point
of
which
is
now
fast
yielding
to
the
mechanical
processes
so
that
the
moment
is
perhaps
the
best
we
shall
have
we
want
to
accompany
the
publication
with
a
short
essay
on
the
subject
to
go
with
the
portfolio
in
a
little
book
and
afterwards
to
be
bound
up
with
the
popular
edition
should
we
make
one
it
was
just
one
of
those
schemes
that
my
husband
could
set
his
heart
upon
requiring
much
knowledge
and
condensed
writing
so
he
gladly
accepted
the
task
and
applied
himself
to
it
as
soon
as
the
engravings
reached
him
on
receiving
the
manuscript
burlingame
wrote
the
paper
on
the
engravers
so
thoroughly
fulfilled
our
expectations
that
we
were
more
than
ever
glad
that
we
asked
your
help
in
this
to
us
important
matter
in
the
spring
before
the
opening
of
the
salons
there
are
always
a
good
many
minor
exhibitions
and
these
we
went
to
see
in
order
to
judge
of
the
prevailing
artistic
tendencies
i
find
this
note
in
the
diary
march
went
with
wife
in
the
afternoon
to
see
some
pictures
by
the
at
petit
most
of
them
horribly
bad
especially
the
impressionists
but
several
by
boudot
were
excellent
these
were
landscapes
all
in
perfectly
true
tone
and
good
color
with
a
great
deal
of
sound
modest
drawing
i
wish
i
could
paint
like
him
his
work
is
evidently
founded
on
painted
studies
from
nature
indeed
much
of
it
must
have
been
painted
directly
from
nature
made
a
new
plan
for
work
doing
two
tasks
on
alternate
days
one
the
current
book
the
other
some
minor
task
an
article
for
example
in
this
way
both
would
get
on
and
the
interval
would
not
be
long
enough
to
lose
hold
of
either
he
wrote
about
it
to
seeley
and
explained
i
do
know
how
it
will
answer
yet
but
have
hopes
my
great
difficulty
has
always
been
and
it
only
increases
with
age
a
certain
want
of
readiness
and
flexibility
in
turning
from
one
thing
to
another
when
i
have
a
book
in
hand
and
i
always
have
one
it
is
most
disagreeable
to
me
to
turn
from
it
and
write
an
article
and
when
the
article
is
finished
i
lose
always
at
least
a
day
and
often
several
days
before
i
get
well
into
swing
with
the
book
again
my
natural
tendency
is
to
take
up
one
task
and
peg
away
at
it
till
it
is
done
at
roberts
brothers
request
hamerton
had
agreed
to
write
a
translation
of
renan
notice
of
his
sister
henriette
however
he
had
to
give
it
up
not
being
able
to
get
answers
to
his
letters
from
ary
renan
as
he
greatly
appreciated
the
spirit
and
usefulness
of
the
institution
of
the
guild
founded
by
miss
williams
he
wrote
for
its
review
an
article
on
languages
and
peace
and
intended
to
write
others
there
are
some
notes
in
the
diary
at
this
time
which
prove
that
he
could
find
some
effects
to
enjoy
in
paris
march
went
with
stephen
to
see
barker
we
went
on
a
walk
to
the
terrace
at
meudon
where
we
joined
wife
and
daughter
and
raoul
thence
to
a
pond
in
the
wood
came
back
in
the
evening
beautiful
effects
on
the
river
april
went
to
the
mont
val√©rien
and
greatly
enjoyed
the
views
about
it
over
paris
on
one
side
and
the
country
on
the
other
the
best
proof
that
my
husband
nervous
system
was
now
strong
and
healthy
is
that
the
first
time
in
his
he
proposed
that
we
should
go
together
to
the
private
view
of
the
champ
de
mars
to
meet
the
president
of
the
republic
we
had
a
card
of
invitation
and
i
was
so
happy
to
see
him
well
and
to
mark
the
respectful
greetings
which
met
him
from
all
quarters
that
i
enjoyed
the
day
thoroughly
he
was
perfectly
calm
the
whole
time
in
contrast
with
the
excitement
surging
around
him
and
at
night
he
wrote
in
the
diary
we
went
wife
and
i
to
the
champ
de
mars
and
saw
the
president
of
the
republic
arrive
and
all
the
artistic
notabilities
who
received
him
after
the
lunch
saw
the
exhibition
well
and
selected
two
pictures
for
scribner
was
much
impressed
by
tissot
of
christ
we
were
much
amused
by
the
extravagance
of
the
toilettes
particularly
the
feminine
in
april
he
called
upon
mm
louis
deschamps
and
checa
for
notes
of
a
biographical
kind
there
was
an
instantaneous
sympathy
between
him
and
checa
who
was
very
cordial
and
communicative
and
who
soon
returned
his
visit
after
the
publication
of
the
article
concerning
him
checa
wrote
je
vous
remercie
tr√®s
vivement
de
cet
article
s√ªrement
le
plus
exact
que
ait
fait
sur
moi
in
the
studio
of
checa
my
husband
had
met
an
american
artist
wickenden
who
lived
at
auvers
and
who
being
well
acquainted
with
his
works
wished
to
paint
a
portrait
of
the
author
during
the
sittings
a
friendship
was
formed
between
model
and
painter
the
portrait
was
exhibited
in
america
at
keppel
hamerton
having
been
invited
to
preside
at
a
meeting
and
dinner
of
the
society
of
illustrators
and
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
the
history
of
their
art
fixed
an
earlier
date
than
he
had
intended
for
his
proposed
visit
to
london
to
comply
with
their
wishes
he
started
alone
on
may
going
by
way
of
dieppe
and
wrote
in
the
diary
capital
passage
enjoyed
sea
and
color
very
much
indeed
on
the
he
wrote
to
raillard
that
he
was
well
enough
but
that
on
arriving
at
charing
cross
the
trunk
containing
his
clothes
was
missing
he
ended
by
saying
and
i
have
to
preside
over
a
dinner
at
all
events
i
can
not
do
it
in
a
flannel
shirt
i
am
in
a
pretty
mess
he
had
almost
decided
to
buy
a
suit
in
this
emergency
when
he
recovered
the
lost
trunk
after
the
dinner
he
wrote
me
a
long
account
of
it
in
french
the
reception
given
him
by
the
illustrators
had
been
most
cordial
his
speech
had
been
delivered
without
nervousness
or
hesitation
and
with
the
curious
illusion
that
he
was
listening
to
somebody
else
there
had
been
an
animated
debate
on
the
grievances
of
the
illustrators
who
complained
of
the
small
space
allotted
to
the
exhibition
of
their
works
in
the
academy
they
seemed
disposed
to
sign
a
protest
when
he
had
offered
to
go
and
see
sir
frederick
leighton
and
to
talk
the
subject
over
with
him
as
president
of
the
meeting
he
ended
his
letter
with
a
promise
to
have
his
photograph
taken
on
the
morrow
by
elliott
and
fry
i
was
very
glad
of
this
decision
about
his
portrait
for
i
had
not
a
good
likeness
of
him
except
the
fine
photograph
taken
by
palmer
and
of
course
since
that
time
his
features
had
altered
they
retained
their
expression
of
intellectuality
and
dignity
softened
as
it
were
by
the
discipline
and
experience
of
years
hitherto
he
had
always
resisted
any
attempt
to
publish
his
portrait
among
a
series
of
celebrities
but
this
time
he
yielded
to
my
entreaties
and
he
was
afterwards
satisfied
to
have
done
so
for
the
three
photographs
taken
on
the
same
day
were
all
good
likenesses
from
the
best
of
them
was
engraved
later
through
the
care
and
sympathy
of
scribner
the
fine
and
striking
portrait
which
appeared
in
their
magazine
of
february
it
was
i
believe
a
sort
of
unconscious
presentiment
which
prompted
my
husband
to
see
his
friends
during
this
last
visit
to
england
knowing
that
he
had
so
much
pressing
work
on
hand
i
had
been
surprised
by
his
decision
to
go
to
london
so
soon
after
his
last
journey
and
still
more
to
hear
that
he
intended
to
go
to
holmwood
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
gould
the
son
of
his
cousin
anne
to
dorking
to
see
hamerton
of
hellifield
peel
and
her
married
daughter
to
alresford
to
stay
a
couple
of
days
with
sir
seymour
haden
and
his
wife
and
then
to
southampton
to
call
upon
leslie
all
these
arrangements
surprised
me
exceedingly
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
my
husband
health
must
be
excellent
since
he
volunteered
to
undertake
with
evident
pleasure
what
he
would
have
dreaded
to
do
some
time
ago
indeed
his
letters
expressed
nothing
but
enjoyment
from
all
these
visits
and
the
keen
interest
he
took
in
the
academy
exhibition
he
was
made
very
welcome
by
sir
frederick
leighton
to
whom
he
explained
the
grievances
of
the
illustrators
and
who
gave
him
a
promise
to
do
his
best
for
them
and
hamerton
was
glad
to
think
he
might
have
been
of
use
a
singular
occurrence
happened
shortly
after
his
return
friends
more
particularly
those
who
came
from
abroad
were
often
debarred
from
accepting
his
invitations
on
account
of
the
distance
between
paris
and
the
parc
des
princes
and
the
consequent
lateness
of
the
hour
when
they
could
reach
their
home
or
hotel
after
dining
at
cl√©matis
gilbert
therefore
had
adopted
a
plan
much
in
use
in
the
french
capital
which
consists
in
inviting
friends
to
a
conveniently
situated
restaurant
where
the
goodness
of
the
cookery
and
attendance
may
be
relied
upon
it
occurred
to
my
husband
to
try
the
terminus
hotel
at
the
gare
du
havre
from
which
many
travellers
start
for
england
and
he
invited
raillard
to
test
the
place
with
him
they
were
both
pleased
with
it
and
left
at
about
ten
it
was
most
fortunate
that
they
did
not
remain
much
longer
for
at
eleven
an
explosion
caused
by
a
dynamite
bomb
wrecked
the
room
in
which
they
had
dined
and
wounded
several
people
a
meeting
with
frederick
harrison
took
place
in
june
and
the
day
was
spent
in
visiting
the
louvre
tuileries
notre
dame
and
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
we
had
also
been
expecting
with
pleasant
anticipations
the
visit
of
niles
when
we
received
the
sad
news
of
his
death
at
perugia
and
learned
that
he
had
been
in
failing
health
for
some
years
and
had
decided
to
come
to
europe
for
rest
my
husband
regrets
were
very
sincere
from
time
to
time
we
had
news
of
stevenson
those
received
in
a
letter
from
stevenson
in
the
course
of
the
same
mouth
were
very
pleasing
i
heard
from
stevenson
a
few
weeks
ago
he
said
you
saw
me
here
you
would
no
longer
question
my
wisdom
in
staying
you
would
not
wonder
at
my
preferring
this
life
to
that
of
bournemouth
in
england
he
passed
half
his
time
in
bed
the
whole
winter
in
the
house
and
he
could
never
walk
now
he
is
out
by
six
in
the
morning
sometimes
bathes
and
occasionally
spends
the
whole
day
in
the
saddle
he
was
always
fond
of
the
open
air
and
though
never
strong
was
a
good
walker
and
as
you
know
able
to
do
a
little
boating
he
often
spoke
to
me
of
his
visit
to
you
at
autun
the
assassination
of
president
carnot
which
occurred
in
june
grieved
and
horrified
my
husband
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
frenchman
he
had
the
greatest
respect
for
the
scrupulous
manner
in
which
carnot
discharged
all
his
duties
and
admired
the
simple
dignity
with
which
he
held
the
rank
of
first
citizen
of
a
great
nation
being
himself
a
liberal
but
a
moderate
one
it
had
given
him
hopes
for
the
stability
of
a
republic
to
see
at
the
head
of
it
the
personification
of
unsuspected
honesty
and
wise
patriotism
on
the
whole
he
was
satisfied
with
the
choice
of
his
successor
and
amused
by
this
phrase
about
in
one
of
letters
i
saw
a
portrait
of
the
new
french
president
lately
he
looks
a
man
not
to
be
trifled
with
the
remark
has
been
curiously
justified
since
having
to
go
out
so
frequently
now
in
the
afternoons
in
order
to
see
artists
and
pictures
my
husband
altered
his
rules
of
work
and
devoted
the
whole
of
the
mornings
to
literary
composition
and
the
heat
being
very
oppressive
this
summer
he
worked
better
in
the
cooler
time
of
day
yet
i
was
rather
afraid
of
the
consequences
when
i
saw
him
start
for
paris
with
the
thermometer
standing
at
or
almost
every
afternoon
but
he
maintained
that
it
did
him
no
harm
on
july
the
f√™te
nationale
jaccaci
having
called
with
vierge
gilbert
went
back
to
dine
with
him
in
paris
and
to
see
the
fireworks
they
were
both
struck
by
the
extraordinary
quietness
of
the
great
town
generally
so
merry
and
noisy
at
that
date
but
now
subdued
by
respectful
sympathy
for
the
death
of
its
late
president
note
in
the
diary
never
saw
streets
of
paris
so
quiet
before
could
cross
easily
anywhere
in
avenue
de
could
count
people
we
had
heard
from
raillard
that
the
reputation
of
his
was
penetrating
into
germany
he
had
seen
some
notices
and
reviews
of
his
works
and
in
august
a
professor
at
the
zurich
university
sent
this
flattering
letter
monsieur
je
vais
publier
une

biblioth√®que

vous

et

la
bont√©
de
me
fournir
quelques
dates
sur
votre
vie
et
sur
vos
autres
ouvrages
que
je
pourrais
utiliser
pour
just
at
the
time
when
my
husband
was
making
extensive
plans
of
work
justified
as
it
seemed
by
the
great
improvement
in
his
health
he
was
suddenly
attacked
by
a
new
malady
which
he
believed
to
be
asthma
there
were
no
premonitory
symptoms
he
was
as
well
as
usual
in
the
daytime
and
even
after
going
to
bed
where
he
always
read
before
going
to
sleep
but
directly
he
fell
asleep
he
was
suddenly
aroused
again
by
suffocation
in
describing
his
sensations
to
me
he
said
it
seemed
as
if
breathing
required
while
in
a
waking
state
a
slight
effort
which
he
made
unconsciously
and
this
being
discontinued
when
sleep
arrived
produced
suffocation
i
attributed
this
painful
state
to
a
change
in
the
working
of
his
nervous
system
and
pressed
him
to
see
a
doctor
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
becoming
asthmatic
and
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
although
he
told
me
that
if
he
had
his
choice
in
the
matter
he
would
rather
die
than
be
condemned
to
a
life
of
impotence
with
perpetual
cares
and
precautions
he
bore
his
sufferings
or
rather
forebodings
with
his
accustomed
courage
and
patience
and
attempted
to
calm
my
apprehensions
by
affirming
that
though
his
nights
were
disturbed
he
could
still
get
sleep
out
of
bed
in
an
and
now
and
then
in
the
when
overpowered
by
fatigue
the
various
means
of
relief
used
by
asthmatic
people
and
recommended
by
different
friends
proving
without
exception
utterly
inefficacious
for
him
i
attempted
to
console
him
by
pointing
out
that
asthma
often
manifested
itself
at
very
long
intervals
and
that
in
general
the
worst
attacks
were
hardly
more
painful
than
those
of
gout
he
answered
that
he
could
bear
the
pain
of
these
attacks
but
what
he
dreaded
most
was
chronic
asthma
which
by
lowering
his
general
health
would
reduce
him
to
an
invalid
state
however
the
worst
symptoms
soon
subsided
and
about
three
weeks
after
the
first
disturbance
he
was
writing
to
seeley
i
am
much
better
though
my
nights
are
still
frequently
interrupted
i
require
a
great
deal
of
exercise
more
than
i
can
find
time
for
the
more
exercise
i
take
the
better
i
am
and
yet
when
shortly
afterwards
a
specialist
had
to
be
called
in
he
declared
that
his
patient
was
completely
overworked
mentally
and
physically
and
he
ordered
him
to
give
up
the
velocipede
altogether
and
to
restrict
his
walks
to
short
distances
and
a
leisurely
pace
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
it
was
that
physical
exercise
being
so
hurtful
to
gilbert
he
should
invariably
have
felt
benefited
by
it
so
far
as
his
sensations
went
the
vacation
had
come
round
again
and
the
impossibility
of
realizing
the
pleasant
plans
we
had
formed
obliged
our
children
to
alter
theirs
stephen
went
to
london
and
raillard
took
his
wife
through
switzerland
to
germany
they
had
frequently
written
on
their
way
and
now
told
of
their
impressions
of
freiburg
where
they
decided
to
remain
three
weeks
i
mentioned
before
that
my
husband
knowledge
of
places
which
he
had
never
seen
was
surprising
in
this
instance
he
could
induce
mary
and
her
husband
to
believe
that
he
had
actually
stayed
where
they
were
the
attempt
amused
him
and
he
read
me
the
following
letter
before
posting
it
ma
ch√®re

√©crit

to
the
infinite
amusement
of
vieux
papa
his
daughter
answered
immediately
we
never
knew
that
you
had
been
at
freiburg
etc
in
the
course
of
august
my
husband
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
scribner
who
called
upon
him
in
the
company
of
jaccaci
the
improvement
in
gilbert
state
did
not
last
we
renewed
our
entreaties
about
having
a
doctor
advice
and
he
yielded
the
great
physician
whom
we
called
in
declared
it
was
weakness
of
the
heart
due
to
overwork
that
his
patient
was
suffering
from
and
not
asthma
he
promised
to
set
him
up
again
in
four
months
with
his
prescriptions
strange
to
say
gilbert
was
greatly
relieved
to
hear
that
his
case
was
hypertrophy
of
the
heart
rather
than
asthma
for
me
it
was
the
dreaded
confirmation
of
fears
that
had
long
haunted
me
still
we
both
derived
hope
and
encouragement
from
the
doctor
assurance
of
an
ultimate
cure
i
can
not
say
that
we
really
believed
in
a
total
cure
but
we
thought
it
possible
to
recover
the
former
state
of
health
which
had
preceded
the
attacks
of
suffocation
i
have
not
felt
old
hitherto
my
husband
said
certainly
not
more
than
if
i
had
been
only
fifty
but
the
fact
is
i
am
now
sixty
and
therefore
must
be
prepared
to
face
the
advent
of
old
age
i
will
submit
to
any
privation
for
the
sake
of
health
though
it
seems
hard
to
be
deprived
of
exercise
it
is
singular
that
my
mental
state
should
be
clearer
and
more
vigorous
than
ever
before
and
that
my
work
should
be
easier
and
more
enjoyable
than
at
any
former
time
seeley
had
written
what
a
good
thing
you
called
in
this
parisian
doctor
it
might
have
been
serious
if
you
had
gone
on
taking
strong
exercise
in
your
present
state
of
health
i
can
quite
understand
your
feeling
of
relief
that
at
any
rate
it
is
not
asthma
perhaps
when
you
take
less
exercise
the
gout
may
return
and
the
heart
be
relieved
at
once
that
the
doctor
confidently
promises
a
cure
in
a
few
months
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
us
the
good
results
of
the
prescribed
regimen
were
soon
experienced
and
i
hailed
not
unhopefully
the
return
of
an
attack
of
gout
predicted
by
seeley
which
i
feared
less
for
gilbert
than
the
heart
troubles
the
doctor
had
said
after
hearing
that
the
gout
had
almost
entirely
disappeared
you
have
made
a
bad
bargain
in
exchanging
gout
for
hypertrophy
this
is
what
my
husband
himself
wrote
to
his
friend
the
worst
of
me
just
now
for
making
inquiries
is
that
on
getting
up
this
morning
i
found
i
had
an
attack
of
gout
in
my
right
knee
hitherto
it
is
only
slight
i
write
at
two
but
i
can
not
bend
it
without
considerable
pain
so
i
must
wait
till
at
any
rate
before
trying
to
go
to
paris
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
attack
may
be
very
slight
but
it
is
also
possible
that
i
may
be
laid
up
by
it
however
this
may
be
i
will
of
course
keep
your
letter
and
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
in
the
present
emergency
many
thanks
for
your
very
kind
letter
about
my
doctor
visit
i
wish
i
had
known
him
ten
years
sooner
he
is
most
scrupulously
observant
of
things
as
they
really
are
and
does
not
set
off
as
doctors
often
do
from
a
preconceived
notion
of
his
own
the
results
of
the
regimen
are
already
beneficial
my
nights
have
been
gradually
improving
since
it
began
last
night
i
slept
perfectly
till
about
two
in
the
morning
and
then
awoke
without
any
suffocation
and
soon
fell
asleep
again
remaining
quiet
with
good
breathing
till
six
about
a
week
since
i
could
not
sleep
being
immediately
awakened
by
suffocation
every
time
i
began
to
drop
off
please
thank
seeley
on
my
part
and
my
wife
for
her
kind
sympathy
which
we
know
is
most
sincere
tell
her
i
regret
to
have
called
you
her
teetotal
husband
as
i
am
no
better
myself
nay
it
is
you
who
have
the
advantage
of
me
with
your
two
glasses
of
claret
which
i
call
downright
intemperance
he
was
allowed
to
drink
nothing
but
milk
our
children
feeling
uneasy
still
and
anxious
about
the
state
of
their
father
cut
their
journey
rather
short
to
be
back
again
with
him
raillard
wished
to
see
sens
in
coming
back
and
the
house
we
had
lived
in
there
so
his
sent
him
some
information
about
the
place
and
added
ne
manquez
pas

the
rules
of
work
had
been
perforce
relaxed
lately
and
almost
all
the
working
time
had
been
devoted
to
writing
the
quest
of
happiness
and
an
article
on
formative
influences
for
the
forum
besides
the
concluding
articles
for
scribner
magazine
a
decided
and
rapid
improvement
in
health
had
taken
place
and
when
at
the
beginning
of
october
miss
came
to
see
us
she
found
my
husband
much
as
usual
though
looking
older
as
she
told
me
afterwards
a
few
days
after
she
had
come
to
at
cl√©matis
we
went
to
lunch
with
her
at
her
hotel
and
spent
the
whole
day
together
visiting
the
mus√©e
carnavalet
and
having
a
long
walk
the
whole
way
back
to
the
rue
we
crossed
the
cour
du
louvre
where
my
husband
explained
in
detail
the
various
transformations
and
changes
in
the
architecture
of
the
palace
at
different
periods
of
time
then
in
the
fading
twilight
we
had
a
look
at
the
magnificent
and
poetical
vista
opened
by
the
removal
of
the
tuileries
before
saying
goodbye
and
when
we
reached
cl√©matis
for
a
late
dinner
gilbert
told
my
mother
that
he
had
enjoyed
the
day
and
did
not
feel
tired
in
the
least
on
the
following
sunday
we
had
a
long
walk
in
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
with
some
friends
and
near
the
arc
de
triomphe
de
we
happened
to
espy
the
doctor
when
my
husband
remarked
cheerfully
doctor
b
who
was
to
see
me
again
in
two
months
would
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
am
cured
already
on
october
a
fire
was
lighted
for
the
first
time
this
autumn
in
gilbert
study
and
before
the
flue
became
heated
and
a
good
draught
produced
the
smoke
was
considerable
i
warned
him
not
to
remain
in
the
room
the
air
being
so
bad
he
answered
that
as
soon
as
the
work
he
had
begun
allowed
of
it
he
would
go
out
i
left
the
door
open
on
purpose
and
begged
him
not
to
close
it
but
when
i
went
up
again
with
the
letters
two
hours
after
i
found
him
still
at
work
in
an
atmosphere
of
dense
yellow
smoke
without
possible
escape
the
door
having
been
closed
again
as
usual
when
writing
my
husband
became
so
wrapt
in
his
work
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
anything
outside
of
it
i
became
alarmed
for
him
as
i
could
hardly
breathe
but
he
felt
no
inconvenience
just
then
in
the
afternoon
he
had
a
walk
but
in
the
evening
he
went
up
again
to
the
study
and
remained
there
over
an
hour
giving
a
lesson
in
english
pronunciation
to
one
of
his
nephews
the
smoke
had
however
subsided
and
the
fire
burned
steadily
at
one
i
was
awakened
by
a
sensation
of
chill
on
the
forehead
it
came
from
my
husband
lips
he
was
giving
me
as
he
thought
a
kiss
for
he
murmured
faintly
voulu
te
dire
que
je
bien
aim√©e
car
je
crois
que
je
vais
mourir
he
was
deadly
pale
but
quite
collected
i
helped
him
to
dress
and
we
managed
to
reach
the
garden
for
purer
air
he
wrote
afterwards
in
his
diary
that
his
sufferings
had
been
horrible
and
lasted
in
full
two
hours
and
a
half
i
tried
to
encourage
him
in
the
struggle
for
life
by
saying
that
it
was
asthma
and
that
i
had
witnessed
a
dear
relation
of
ours
struggling
successfully
through
several
similar
attacks
i
felt
certain
now
that
it
was
asthma
and
i
said
so
to
the
doctor
on
the
following
day
he
answered
it
is
cardiac
asthma
then
it
was
freezing
hard
outside
and
as
soon
as
he
recovered
breathing
power
i
led
my
husband
to
the
sofa
which
i
wheeled
in
front
of
the
chimney
and
the
wood
being
piled
up
ready
for
a
fire
i
made
a
great
blaze
and
opened
the
windows
wide
at
the
same
time
once
stretched
on
the
couch
and
wrapped
up
in
blankets
facing
the
leaping
flames
he
soon
regained
vital
warmth
and
his
breathing
became
more
regular
altogether
the
crisis
had
lasted
five
hours
during
which
i
had
remained
alone
with
him
without
even
calling
a
maid
for
fear
of
making
him
worse
through
annoyance
i
affected
entire
freedom
from
anxiety
as
to
the
end
merely
expressing
sympathy
with
his
momentary
sufferings
and
i
was
thankful
to
succeed
in
deceiving
him
as
soon
as
he
felt
well
enough
to
be
left
for
a
short
time
i
hastened
to
the
doctor
but
went
first
to
tell
mary
and
her
husband
of
the
sad
occurrence
that
they
might
go
to
their
father
while
i
should
be
away
the
doctor
attributed
the
attack
entirely
to
the
effect
of
the
smoke
and
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
husband
malady
he
had
been
asphyxiated
it
would
have
no
lasting
effects
except
as
to
retarding
the
cure
the
ground
gained
since
the
beginning
of
the
regimen
had
been
lost
and
it
was
all
to
begin
over
again
i
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
from
him
my
anxious
fears
nor
my
feelings
when
i
had
witnessed
my
husband
tortures
without
any
means
or
hopes
of
alleviating
them
for
i
added
i
have
been
told
there
is
no
help
in
cases
of
acute
asthma
there
not
he
answered
till
a
quite
recent
discovery
but
now
immediate
relief
may
be
given
by
injections
of
serum
though
he
assured
me
that
there
would
be
no
other
attack
of
the
same
kind
if
we
took
care
to
have
only
wood
fires
and
no
smoke
i
insisted
upon
being
recommended
to
a
reliable
doctor
not
far
from
our
house
who
would
promise
to
come
at
any
time
of
night
if
we
needed
him
and
who
would
always
have
serum
in
his
possession
the
great
specialist
being
himself
at
too
great
a
distance
from
us
to
be
fetched
in
an
emergency
the
very
doctor
i
wanted
happened
to
be
this
very
day
sharing
as
he
often
did
the
labors
and
studies
of
the
specialist
he
was
called
in
and
after
listening
to
an
explanation
gave
me
the
promise
i
desired
and
said
he
would
follow
me
immediately
to
cl√©matis
to
see
the
patient
and
if
he
should
see
the
necessity
for
it
would
ask
his
friend
to
join
him
at
our
house
for
a
consultation
as
he
noticed
the
distress
under
which
i
was
laboring
the
physician
kindly
said
before
i
left
him
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
apprehend
a
recurrence
of
what
happened
last
night
but
si
par
impossible
une
autre
crise
semblable
survenait
bien
que
m√™me
suivie
de
syncope
elle
ne
serait
i
believed
him
though
my
heart
was
still
heavy
at
the
thoughts
of
the
sufferings
that
the
future
might
bring
to
my
husband
i
felt
greatly
relieved
in
being
able
to
give
him
the
doctor
assurance
that
there
was
no
danger
for
his
life
i
was
happy
on
entering
the
to
see
him
quietly
talking
with
mary
and
raoul
and
eating
grapes
he
said
that
with
the
exception
of
fatigue
he
felt
very
well
indeed
he
had
taken
some
broth
and
partook
of
a
light
dinner
with
pleasure
the
doctor
delegated
by
the
physician
after
an
examination
merely
confirmed
what
had
been
said
to
me
and
saw
no
necessity
for
a
consultation
with
his
friend
on
the
morrow
we
arranged
a
temporary
study
to
avoid
fresh
troubles
with
the
stove
and
kept
up
good
ventilation
with
a
bright
wood
fire
and
frequent
opening
of
windows
looking
out
on
the
garden
gilbert
resumed
his
ordinary
work
with
great
moderation
taking
care
to
interrupt
whatever
he
was
doing
every
hour
by
a
short
walk
in
the
open
air
according
to
medical
advice
four
days
later
i
find
this
entry
in
the
october
walked
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
towards
evening
in
an
enchantment
of
color
and
light
beautiful
autumnal
color
on
trees
one
of
my
husband
last
satisfactions
in
life
was
a
letter
for
burlingame
about
the
work
lately
done
for
scribner
here
is
a
passage
out
of
it
i
have
long
had
in
mind
to
say
of
the
conclusion
of
the
series
how
much
of
a
success
i
think
our
last
plan
proved
and
how
cordially
we
all
appreciate
the
very
valuable
and
punctual
fulfilment
which
you
kindly
gave
to
it
all
our
relations
during
its
progress
were
a
great
pleasure
to
me
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
magazine
may
have
the
benefit
of
your
help
again
it
will
always
gratify
us
very
much
to
know
of
any
suggestion
or
papers
that
occur
to
you
which
you
might
be
inclined
to
send
our
way
scribner
and
jaccaci
are
back
again
and
we
all
often
speak
of
you
with
pleasant
recollections
of
your
kindness
in
paris
although
scribner
pecuniary
arrangements
were
very
liberal
my
husband
satisfaction
in
his
dealings
with
them
was
mostly
derived
from
their
courtesy
for
though
he
was
obliged
to
take
money
into
consideration
it
was
almost
the
least
weighty
of
considerations
with
him
he
often
said
he
did
not
like
money
he
looked
upon
it
as
the
indispensable
means
of
providing
necessaries
and
thereby
affording
the
mind
sufficient
peace
to
apply
itself
to
study
in
freedom
from
anxious
cares
he
never
desired
riches
or
luxury
and
hated
to
have
to
think
about
money
matters
or
to
talk
about
them
even
to
me
and
aware
that
the
subject
was
more
than
disagreeable
painful
i
avoided
it
as
much
as
possible
after
the
first
terrible
attack
of
suffocation
seeley
had
been
reluctant
to
ask
for
my
husband
help
still
as
he
had
recovered
so
soon
and
had
resumed
his
ordinary
avocations
he
was
willing
and
able
to
do
several
urgent
things
for
the
portfolio
and
seeley
wrote
you
have
done
before
receiving
my
last
letter
exactly
what
it
asked
you
to
do
what
a
good
thing
when
editor
and
publisher
are
in
such
perfect
i
hope
you
have
not
had
any
more
attacks
no
he
had
not
and
his
nights
were
quiet
again
though
he
got
up
very
early
at
four
or
five
in
the
morning
and
had
a
nap
in
the
afternoon
the
only
thing
he
complained
of
was
a
sensation
of
weakness
unknown
to
him
before
it
was
not
sufficient
to
be
called
painful
but
still
he
felt
it
to
be
there
and
hoped
to
get
rid
of
it
when
allowed
a
little
beer
or
claret
he
so
much
disliked
drinking
milk
at
that
it
quite
spoilt
his
appetite
until
the
doctor
said
he
might
have
water
during
his
repasts
and
milk
in
the
intervals
on
account
of
the
diminution
in
strength
i
was
afraid
of
the
effects
that
fatigue
might
produce
and
did
not
like
to
see
him
go
so
often
to
paris
as
he
had
lately
done
especially
to
the
exhibitions
but
when
it
could
not
be
avoided
i
managed
to
go
with
him
under
the
pretext
that
i
was
interested
in
them
myself
on
november
he
asked
me
if
i
should
like
to
go
with
him
to
the
louvre
where
he
had
to
see
the
salle
des
primitifs
i
said
yes
he
spent
an
hour
there
enjoying
heartily
the
best
pictures
and
extolling
their
merits
as
we
were
coming
back
according
to
his
habit
he
was
reading
in
the
on
his
way
home
and
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
volume
of
virgil
and
in
looking
up
from
the
book
to
his
face
i
observed
that
he
looked
paler
than
usual
i
inquired
if
he
felt
tired
he
answered
not
in
the
least
and
when
we
reached
home
he
went
up
straight
to
his
study
and
wrote
till
the
bell
called
him
to
dinner
we
had
a
pleasant
talk
about
the
pictures
he
had
just
studied
while
he
was
eating
with
a
good
appetite
after
dinner
as
usual
he
took
up
his
newspaper
and
read
for
about
ten
minutes
when
he
suddenly
threw
it
aside
and
told
me
the
action
of
the
heart
was
unsatisfactory
i
proposed
at
once
to
go
to
the
garden
but
the
suddenness
and
violence
of
the
attack
did
not
allow
him
to
reach
it
when
in
the
open
air
just
above
the
few
stone
steps
he
had
to
stop
and
grasp
the
railing
till
the
last
anguish
deprived
him
of
breath
and
of
life
long
before
the
arrival
of
the
doctors
whom
i
had
sent
for
as
soon
as
he
had
felt
oppressed
he
had
never
feared
death
whatever
might
await
him
after
conscious
of
a
useful
and
blameless
life
he
died
as
he
had
desired
to
die
standing
alone
with
me
under
the
moonlit
sky
unconfined
escaping
from
the
decrepitude
of
old
age
still
in
the
full
possession
and
maturity
of
his
talents
and
in
the
active
use
of
them
two
hours
before
his
death
he
had
been
writing
these
last
words
for
the
quest
of
happiness
if
i
indulge
my
imagination
in
dreaming
about
a
country
where
justice
and
right
would
always
surely
prevail
where
the
weak
would
never
be
oppressed
nor
an
honest
man
incur
any
penalty
for
his
honesty
a
country
where
no
animal
would
ever
be
or
killed
otherwise
than
in
mercy
that
is
truly
ideal
dreaming
because
however
far
i
travel
i
shall
not
find
such
a
country
in
the
world
and
there
is
not
any
record
of
such
a
country
in
the
authentic
history
of
mankind
let
us
hope
he
may
have
found
this
ideal
country
in
the
unknown
world
