preface
some
time
ago
my
friends
houghton
mifflin
requested
me
to
write
a
small
book
on
civil
government
in
the
united
states
which
might
be
useful
as
a
and
at
the
same
time
serviceable
and
suggestive
to
the
general
reader
interested
in
american
history
in
preparing
the
book
certain
points
have
been
kept
especially
in
view
and
deserve
some
mention
here
it
seemed
desirable
to
adopt
a
historical
method
of
exposition
not
simply
describing
our
political
institutions
in
their
present
shape
but
pointing
out
their
origin
indicating
some
of
the
processes
through
which
they
have
acquired
that
present
shape
and
thus
keeping
before
the
student
mind
the
fact
that
government
is
perpetually
undergoing
modifications
in
adapting
itself
to
new
conditions
inasmuch
as
such
gradual
changes
in
government
do
not
make
themselves
but
are
made
by
men
and
made
either
for
better
or
for
worse
it
is
obvious
that
the
history
of
political
institutions
has
serious
lessons
to
teach
us
the
student
should
as
soon
as
possible
come
to
understand
that
every
institution
is
the
outgrowth
of
experiences
one
probably
gets
but
little
benefit
from
abstract
definitions
and
axioms
concerning
the
rights
of
men
and
the
nature
of
civil
society
such
as
we
often
find
at
the
beginning
of
books
on
government
metaphysical
generalizations
are
well
enough
in
their
place
but
to
start
with
such
things
as
the
french
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
fond
of
doing
is
to
get
the
cart
before
the
horse
it
is
better
to
have
our
story
first
and
thus
find
out
what
government
in
its
concrete
reality
has
been
and
is
then
we
may
finish
up
with
the
metaphysics
or
do
as
i
have
done
leave
it
for
somebody
else
i
was
advised
to
avoid
the
extremely
systematic
intrusively
symmetrical
style
of
exposition
which
is
sometimes
deemed
indispensable
in
a
book
of
this
sort
it
was
thought
that
students
would
be
more
likely
to
become
interested
in
the
subject
if
it
were
treated
in
the
same
informal
manner
into
which
one
naturally
falls
in
giving
lectures
to
young
people
i
have
endeavoured
to
bear
this
in
mind
without
sacrificing
that
lucidity
in
the
arrangement
of
topics
which
is
always
the
supreme
consideration
for
many
years
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
lecturing
on
history
to
college
students
in
different
parts
of
the
united
states
to
young
ladies
in
private
schools
and
occasionally
to
the
pupils
in
high
and
normal
schools
and
in
writing
this
little
book
i
have
imagined
an
audience
of
these
earnest
and
intelligent
young
friends
gathered
before
me
i
was
especially
advised
by
my
friend
james
macalister
superintendent
of
schools
in
philadelphia
for
whose
judgment
i
have
the
highest
respect
to
make
it
a
book
less
than
three
hundred
pages
in
length
if
possible
teachers
and
pupils
do
not
have
time
enough
to
deal
properly
with
large
treatises
brevity
therefore
is
golden
a
concise
manual
is
the
desideratum
touching
lightly
upon
the
various
points
bringing
out
their
relationships
distinctly
and
referring
to
more
elaborate
treatises
monographs
and
documents
for
the
use
of
those
who
wish
to
pursue
the
study
at
greater
length
within
limits
thus
restricted
it
will
probably
seem
strange
to
some
that
so
much
space
is
given
to
the
treatment
of
local
institutions
comprising
the
governments
of
town
county
and
city
it
may
be
observed
by
the
way
that
some
persons
apparently
conceive
of
the
state
also
as
a
local
institution
in
a
recent
review
of
professor
howard
admirable
local
constitutional
history
of
the
united
states
we
read
the
first
volume
which
is
all
that
is
yet
published
treats
of
the
development
of
the
township
hundred
and
shire
the
second
volume
we
suppose
being
designed
to
treat
of
the
state
constitutions
the
reviewer
forgets
that
there
is
such
a
subject
as
the
development
of
the
city
and
local
magistracies
which
is
to
be
the
subject
of
that
second
volume
and
lets
us
see
that
in
his
apprehension
the
american
state
is
an
institution
of
the
same
order
as
the
town
and
county
we
can
thus
readily
assent
when
we
are
told
that
many
youth
have
grown
to
manhood
with
so
little
appreciation
of
the
political
importance
of
the
state
as
to
believe
it
nothing
more
than
a
geographical
division
in
its
historic
genesis
the
american
state
is
not
an
institution
of
the
same
order
as
the
town
and
county
nor
has
it
as
yet
become
depressed
or
mediatized
to
that
degree
the
state
while
it
does
not
possess
such
attributes
of
sovereignty
as
were
by
our
federal
constitution
granted
to
the
united
states
does
nevertheless
possess
many
very
important
and
essential
characteristics
of
a
sovereign
body
as
is
here
pointed
out
on
pages
the
study
of
our
state
governments
is
inextricably
wrapped
up
with
the
study
of
our
national
government
in
such
wise
that
both
are
parts
of
one
subject
which
can
not
be
understood
unless
both
parts
are
studied
whether
in
the
course
of
our
country
future
development
we
shall
ever
arrive
at
a
stage
in
which
this
is
not
the
case
must
be
left
for
future
events
to
determine
but
if
we
ever
do
arrive
at
such
a
stage
american
institutions
will
present
a
very
different
aspect
from
those
with
which
we
are
now
familiar
and
which
we
have
always
been
accustomed
even
perhaps
without
always
understanding
them
to
admire

young
class
p
iv
the
study
of
local
government
properly
includes
town
county
and
city
to
this
part
of
the
subject
i
have
devoted
about
half
of
my
limited
space
quite
unheedful
of
the
warning
which
i
find
in
the
preface
of
a
certain
popular
that
to
learn
the
duties
of
town
city
and
county
officers
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
grand
and
noble
subject
of
civil
government
and
that
to
attempt
class
drill
on
petty
town
and
county
offices
would
be
simply
burlesque
of
the
whole
subject
but
suppose
one
were
to
say
with
an
air
of
ineffable
scorn
that
petty
experiments
on
terrestrial
gravitation
and
radiant
heat
such
as
can
be
made
with
commonplace
pendulums
and
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
grand
and
noble
subject
of
physical
astronomy
science
would
not
have
got
very
far
on
that
plan
i
fancy
the
truth
is
that
science
while
it
is
perpetually
dealing
with
questions
of
magnitude
and
knows
very
well
what
is
large
and
what
is
small
knows
nothing
whatever
of
any
such
distinction
as
that
between
things
that
are
grand
and
things
that
are
petty
when
we
try
to
study
things
in
a
scientific
spirit
to
learn
their
modes
of
genesis
and
their
present
aspects
in
order
that
we
may
foresee
their
tendencies
and
make
our
volitions
count
for
something
in
modifying
them
there
is
nothing
which
we
may
safely
disregard
as
trivial
this
is
true
of
whatever
we
can
study
it
is
eminently
true
of
the
history
of
institutions
government
is
not
a
royal
mystery
to
be
shut
off
like
old
deiokes
by
a
sevenfold
wall
from
the
ordinary
business
of
life
questions
of
civil
government
are
practical
business
questions
the
principles
of
which
are
as
often
and
as
forcibly
illustrated
in
a
city
council
or
a
county
board
of
supervisors
as
in
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
it
is
partly
because
too
many
of
our
citizens
fail
to
realize
that
local
government
is
a
worthy
study
that
we
find
it
making
so
much
trouble
for
us
the
bummers
and
boodlers
do
not
find
the
subject
beneath
their
notice
the
master
who
inspires
them
is
wide
awake
and
for
a
creature
that
divides
the
hoof
extremely
intelligent
footnote
herodotus
i
it
is
moreover
the
mental
training
gained
through
contact
with
local
government
that
enables
the
people
of
a
community
to
conduct
successfully
through
their
representatives
the
government
of
the
state
and
the
nation
and
so
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
government
of
a
town
or
county
is
of
one
sort
or
another
if
the
average
character
of
our
local
governments
for
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
had
been
as
high
as
that
of
the
boston
or
the
virginia
boards
of
county
magistrates
in
the
days
of
samuel
adams
and
patrick
henry
who
can
doubt
that
many
an
airy
demagogue
who
through
session
after
session
has
played
his
pranks
at
the
national
capital
would
long
ago
have
been
abruptly
recalled
to
his
native
heath
a
sadder
if
not
a
wiser
man
we
can
not
expect
the
nature
of
the
aggregate
to
be
much
better
than
the
average
natures
of
its
units
one
may
hear
people
gravely
discussing
the
difference
between
frenchmen
and
englishmen
in
political
efficiency
and
resorting
to
assumed
ethnological
causes
to
explain
it
when
very
likely
to
save
their
lives
they
could
not
describe
the
difference
between
a
french
commune
and
an
english
parish
to
comprehend
the
interesting
contrasts
between
gambetta
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
gladstone
in
the
house
of
commons
one
should
begin
with
a
historical
inquiry
into
the
causes
operating
through
forty
generations
which
have
frittered
away
in
the
rural
districts
and
small
towns
of
france
until
there
is
very
little
left
if
things
in
america
ever
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
city
council
of
cambridge
must
ask
congress
each
year
how
much
money
it
can
be
allowed
to
spend
for
municipal
purposes
while
the
mayor
of
cambridge
holds
his
office
subject
to
removal
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
we
may
safely
predict
further
extensive
changes
in
the
character
of
the
american
people
and
their
government
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
our
profoundest
political
thinker
thomas
jefferson
attached
so
much
importance
to
the
study
of
the
township
in
determining
the
order
of
exposition
i
have
placed
local
government
first
beginning
with
the
township
as
the
simplest
unit
it
is
well
to
try
to
understand
what
is
near
and
simple
before
dealing
with
what
is
remote
and
complex
in
teaching
geography
with
maps
it
is
wise
to
get
the
pupil
interested
in
the
streets
of
his
own
town
the
country
roads
running
out
of
it
and
the
neighbouring
hills
and
streams
before
burdening
his
attention
with
the
topographical
details
of
borrioboola
gha
to
study
grand
generalizations
about
government
before
attending
to
such
of
its
features
as
come
most
directly
before
us
is
to
run
the
risk
of
achieving
a
result
like
that
attained
by
the
new
hampshire
who
had
studied
geology
in
a
but
was
not
aware
that
he
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
an
igneous
rock
after
the
township
naturally
comes
the
county
the
city
as
is
here
shown
is
not
simply
a
larger
town
but
is
much
more
complex
in
organization
historically
many
cities
have
been
or
still
are
equivalent
to
counties
and
the
development
of
the
county
must
be
studied
before
we
can
understand
that
of
the
city
it
has
been
briefly
indicated
how
these
forms
of
local
government
grew
up
in
england
and
how
they
have
become
variously
modified
in
adapting
themselves
to
different
social
conditions
in
different
parts
of
the
united
states
next
in
order
come
the
general
governments
those
which
possess
and
exert
in
one
way
or
another
attributes
of
sovereignty
first
the
various
colonial
governments
have
been
considered
and
some
features
of
their
metamorphosis
into
our
modern
state
governments
have
been
described
in
the
course
of
this
study
our
attention
is
called
to
the
most
original
and
striking
feature
of
the
development
of
civil
government
upon
american
soil
the
written
constitution
with
the
accompanying
power
of
the
courts
in
certain
cases
to
annul
the
acts
of
the
legislature
this
is
not
only
the
most
original
feature
of
our
government
but
it
is
in
some
respects
the
most
important
without
the
supreme
court
it
is
not
likely
that
the
federal
union
could
have
been
held
together
since
congress
has
now
and
then
passed
an
act
which
the
people
in
some
of
the
states
have
regarded
as
unconstitutional
and
tyrannical
and
in
the
absence
of
a
judicial
method
of
settling
such
questions
the
only
available
remedy
would
have
been
nullification
i
have
devoted
a
brief
chapter
to
the
origin
and
development
of
written
constitutions
and
the
connection
of
our
colonial
charters
therewith
lastly
we
come
to
the
completed
structure
the
federal
union
and
by
this
time
we
have
examined
so
many
points
in
the
general
theory
of
american
government
that
our
federal
constitution
can
be
more
concisely
described
and
i
believe
more
quickly
understood
than
if
we
had
made
it
the
subject
of
the
first
chapter
instead
of
the
last
in
conclusion
there
have
been
added
a
few
brief
hints
and
suggestions
with
reference
to
our
political
history
these
remarks
have
been
intentionally
limited
it
is
no
part
of
the
purpose
of
this
book
to
give
an
account
of
the
doings
of
political
parties
under
the
constitution
but
its
study
may
fitly
be
supplemented
by
that
of
professor
alexander
johnston
history
of
american
politics
this
arrangement
not
only
proceeds
from
the
simpler
forms
of
government
to
the
more
complex
but
it
follows
the
historical
order
of
development
from
time
immemorial
and
down
into
the
lowest
strata
of
savagery
that
have
come
within
our
ken
there
have
been
clans
and
tribes
and
as
is
here
shown
a
township
was
originally
a
stationary
clan
and
a
county
was
originally
a
stationary
tribe
there
were
townships
and
counties
or
equivalent
forms
of
organization
before
there
were
cities
in
like
manner
there
were
townships
counties
and
cities
long
before
there
was
anything
in
the
world
that
could
properly
be
called
a
state
i
have
remarked
below
upon
the
way
in
which
english
shires
coalesced
into
little
states
and
in
course
of
time
the
english
nation
was
formed
by
the
union
of
such
little
states
which
lost
their
statehood
their
functions
of
sovereignty
though
not
their
within
certain
limits
in
the
process
finally
in
america
we
see
an
enormous
nationality
formed
by
the
federation
of
states
which
partially
retain
their
statehood
and
some
of
these
states
are
themselves
of
national
dimensions
as
for
example
new
york
which
is
nearly
equal
in
area
quite
equal
in
population
and
far
superior
in
wealth
to
shakespeare
england
in
studying
the
local
institutions
of
our
different
states
i
have
been
greatly
helped
by
the
johns
hopkins
university
studies
in
history
and
politics
of
which
the
eighth
annual
series
is
now
in
course
of
publication
in
the
course
of
the
pages
below
i
have
frequent
occasion
to
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
these
learned
and
sometimes
profoundly
suggestive
monographs
but
i
can
not
leave
the
subject
without
a
special
word
of
gratitude
to
my
friend
herbert
adams
the
editor
of
the
series
for
the
noble
work
which
he
is
doing
in
promoting
the
study
of
american
history
it
had
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
mere
existence
of
printed
questions
in
proves
that
the
publishers
must
have
rather
a
poor
opinion
of
the
average
intelligence
of
teachers
and
it
also
seemed
as
if
the
practical
effect
of
such
questions
must
often
be
to
make
the
exercise
of
recitation
more
mechanical
for
both
teachers
and
pupils
and
to
encourage
the
besetting
sin
of
learning
by
heart
nevertheless
there
are
usually
two
sides
to
a
case
and
in
deference
to
the
prevailing
custom
for
which
no
doubt
there
is
much
to
be
said
full
sets
of
questions
have
been
appended
to
each
chapter
and
section
it
seemed
desirable
that
such
questions
should
be
prepared
by
some
one
especially
familiar
with
the
use
of
and
for
these
i
have
to
thank
hill
head
master
of
the
cambridge
english
high
school
i
confess
that
hill
questions
have
considerably
modified
my
opinion
as
to
the
merits
of
such
apparatus
they
seem
to
add
very
materially
to
the
usefulness
of
the
book
it
will
be
observed
that
there
are
two
sets
of
these
questions
entirely
distinct
in
character
and
purpose
the
first
set
questions
on
the
text
is
appended
to
each
so
as
to
be
as
near
the
text
as
possible
these
questions
furnish
an
excellent
topical
analysis
of
the
text
in
a
certain
sense
they
ask
what
the
book
says
but
the
teacher
is
advised
emphatically
to
discourage
any
such
thing
as
committing
the
text
to
memory
the
tendency
to
is
very
strong
i
had
to
contend
with
it
in
teaching
history
to
seniors
at
harvard
twenty
years
ago
but
much
has
since
been
done
to
check
it
through
the
development
of
the
modern
german
seminary
methods
for
an
explanation
of
these
methods
see
herbert
adams
on
seminary
libraries
and
university
extension
xi
with
younger
students
the
tendency
is
of
course
stronger
it
is
only
through
much
exercise
that
the
mind
learns
how
to
let
itself
as
matthew
arnold
used
to
say
play
freely
about
the
facts
footnote
this
says
hill
will
please
those
who
prefer
the
topical
method
while
it
does
not
forbid
the
easy
transformation
of
topics
to
questions
which
others
may
demand
in
the
table
of
contents
i
have
made
a
pretty
full
topical
analysis
of
the
book
which
may
prove
useful
for
comparison
with
mr
hill
in
order
to
supply
the
pupil
with
some
wholesome
exercise
of
this
sort
hill
has
added
at
the
end
of
each
a
set
of
suggestive
questions
and
directions
here
he
has
thoroughly
divined
the
purpose
of
the
book
and
done
much
to
further
it
problems
or
cases
are
suggested
for
the
student
to
consider
and
questions
are
asked
which
can
not
be
disposed
of
by
a
direct
appeal
to
the
text
sometimes
the
questions
go
quite
outside
of
the
text
and
relate
to
topics
concerning
which
it
provides
no
information
whatever
this
has
been
done
with
a
purpose
the
pupil
should
learn
how
to
go
outside
of
the
book
and
gather
from
scattered
sources
information
concerning
questions
that
the
book
suggests
in
other
words
he
should
begin
to
learn
to
make
for
that
is
coming
to
be
one
of
the
useful
arts
not
merely
for
scholars
but
for
men
and
women
in
many
sorts
of
avocations
it
is
always
useful
as
well
as
ennobling
to
be
able
to
trace
knowledge
to
its
sources
work
of
this
sort
involves
more
or
less
conference
and
discussion
among
classmates
and
calls
for
active
aid
from
the
teacher
and
if
the
teacher
does
not
at
first
feel
at
home
in
these
methods
practice
will
nevertheless
bring
familiarity
and
will
prove
most
wholesome
training
for
the
aid
of
teachers
and
pupils
as
well
as
of
the
general
reader
who
wishes
to
pursue
the
subject
i
have
added
a
bibliographical
note
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
immediately
after
hill
suggestive
questions
and
directions
this
particular
purpose
in
my
book
must
be
carefully
borne
in
mind
it
explains
the
omission
of
many
details
which
some
on
the
same
subject
would
be
sure
to
include
to
make
a
manual
complete
and
is
precisely
what
i
have
not
intended
the
book
is
designed
to
be
suggestive
and
stimulating
to
leave
the
reader
with
scant
information
on
some
points
to
make
him
as
samuel
weller
says
vish
there
wos
more
and
to
show
him
how
to
go
on
by
himself
i
am
well
aware
that
in
making
an
experiment
in
this
somewhat
new
direction
nothing
is
easier
than
to
fall
into
errors
of
judgment
i
can
hardly
suppose
that
this
book
is
free
from
such
errors
but
if
in
spite
thereof
it
shall
turn
out
to
be
in
any
way
helpful
in
bringing
the
knowledge
and
use
of
the
german
seminary
method
into
our
higher
schools
i
shall
be
more
than
satisfied
just
here
let
me
say
to
young
people
in
all
parts
of
our
country
if
you
have
not
already
done
so
it
would
be
well
worth
while
for
you
to
organize
a
debating
society
in
your
town
or
village
for
the
discussion
of
such
historical
and
practical
questions
relating
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
are
suggested
in
the
course
of
this
book
once
started
there
need
be
no
end
of
interesting
and
profitable
subjects
for
discussion
as
a
further
guide
to
the
books
you
need
in
studying
such
subjects
use
foster
references
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
invaluable
pamphlet
mentioned
below
on
page
if
you
can
not
afford
to
buy
the
books
get
the
public
library
of
your
town
or
village
to
buy
them
or
perhaps
organize
a
small
special
library
for
your
society
or
club
librarians
will
naturally
feel
interested
in
such
a
matter
and
will
often
be
able
to
help
with
advice
a
few
hours
every
week
spent
in
such
wholesome
studies
can
not
fail
to
do
much
toward
the
political
education
of
the
local
community
and
thus
toward
the
general
improvement
of
the
american
people
for
the
amelioration
of
things
will
doubtless
continue
to
be
effected
in
the
future
as
it
has
been
effected
in
the
past
not
by
ambitious
schemes
of
sudden
and
universal
reform
which
the
sagacious
man
always
suspects
just
as
he
suspects
all
schemes
for
returning
a
fabulously
large
interest
upon
investments
but
by
the
gradual
and
cumulative
efforts
of
innumerable
individuals
each
doing
something
to
help
or
instruct
those
to
whom
his
influence
extends

i

in
that
strangely
beautiful
story
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
in
which
charles
reade
has
drawn
such
a
vivid
picture
of
human
life
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
there
is
a
good
description
of
the
siege
of
a
revolted
town
by
the
army
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
arrows
whiz
catapults
hurl
their
ponderous
stones
wooden
towers
are
built
secret
mines

the
sturdy
citizens
led
by
a
tall
knight
who
seems
to
bear
a
charmed
life
baffle
every
device
of
the
besiegers
at
length
the
citizens
capture
the
brother
of
the
duke
general
and
the
besiegers
capture
the
tall
knight
who
turns
out
to
be
no
knight
after
all
but
just
a
plebeian
hosier
the
duke
general
is
on
the
point
of
ordering
the
tradesman
who
has
made
so
much
trouble
to
be
shot
but
the
latter
still
remains
master
of
the
situation
for
as
he
dryly
observes
if
any
harm
comes
to
him
the
enraged
citizens
will
hang
the
brother
some
parley
ensues
in
which
the
shrewd
hosier
promises
for
the
townsfolk
to
set
free
their
prisoner
and
pay
a
round
sum
of
money
if
the
besieging
army
will
depart
and
leave
them
in
peace
the
offer
is
accepted
and
so
the
matter
is
amicably
settled
as
the
worthy
citizen
is
about
to
take
his
leave
the
general
ventures
a
word
of
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
of
the
town
revolt
what
then
is
your
grievance
my
good
friend
our
hosier
knight
though
deft
with
needle
and
keen
with
lance
has
a
stammering
tongue
he
answers
tuta
tuta
tuta
tuta
too
much
taxes
sidenote
too
much
taxes
too
much
taxes
those
three
little
words
furnish
us
with
a
clue
wherewith
to
understand
and
explain
a
great
deal
of
history
a
great
many
sieges
of
towns
so
horrid
to
have
endured
though
so
picturesque
to
read
about
hundreds
of
weary
marches
and
deadly
battles
thousands
of
romantic
plots
that
have
led
their
inventors
to
the
scaffold
have
owed
their
origin
to
questions
of
taxation
the
issue
between
the
ducal
commander
and
the
warlike
tradesman
has
been
tried
over
and
over
again
in
every
country
and
in
every
age
and
not
always
has
the
oppressor
been
so
speedily
thwarted
and
got
rid
of
the
questions
as
to
how
much
the
taxes
shall
be
and
who
is
to
decide
how
much
they
shall
be
are
always
and
in
every
stage
of
society
questions
of
most
fundamental
importance
and
ever
since
men
began
to
make
history
a
very
large
part
of
what
they
have
done
in
the
way
of
making
history
has
been
the
attempt
to
settle
these
questions
whether
by
discussion
or
by
blows
whether
in
council
chambers
or
on
the
battlefield
the
french
revolution
of
the
most
terrible
political
convulsion
of
modern
times
was
caused
chiefly
by
too
much
taxes
and
by
the
fact
that
the
people
who
paid
the
taxes
were
not
the
people
who
decided
what
the
taxes
were
to
be
our
own
revolution
which
made
the
united
states
a
nation
independent
of
great
britain
was
brought
on
by
the
disputed
question
as
to
who
was
to
decide
what
taxes
american
citizens
must
pay
sidenote
what
is
taxation
what
then
are
taxes
the
question
is
one
which
is
apt
to
come
up
sooner
or
later
to
puzzle
children
they
find
no
difficulty
in
understanding
the
butcher
bill
for
so
many
pounds
of
meat
or
the
tailor
bill
for
so
many
suits
of
clothes
where
the
value
received
is
something
that
can
be
seen
and
handled
but
the
tax
bill
though
it
comes
as
inevitably
as
the
autumnal
frosts
bears
no
such
obvious
relation
to
the
incidents
of
domestic
life
it
is
not
quite
so
clear
what
the
money
goes
for
and
hence
it
is
apt
to
be
paid
by
the
head
of
the
household
with
more
or
less
grumbling
while
for
the
younger
members
of
the
family
it
requires
some
explanation
it
only
needs
to
be
pointed
out
however
that
in
every
town
some
things
are
done
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
things
which
concern
one
person
just
as
much
as
another
thus
roads
are
made
and
kept
in
repair
are
built
and
salaries
paid
to
there
are
constables
who
take
criminals
to
jail
there
are
engines
for
putting
out
fires
there
are
public
libraries
town
cemeteries
and
money
raised
for
these
purposes
which
are
supposed
to
concern
all
the
inhabitants
is
supposed
to
be
paid
by
all
the
inhabitants
each
one
furnishing
his
share
and
the
share
which
each
one
pays
is
his
town
tax
sidenote
taxation
and
eminent
domain
from
this
illustration
it
would
appear
that
taxes
are
private
property
taken
for
public
purposes
and
in
making
this
statement
we
come
very
near
the
truth
taxes
are
portions
of
private
property
which
a
government
takes
for
its
public
purposes
before
going
farther
let
us
pause
to
observe
that
there
is
one
other
way
besides
taxation
in
which
government
sometimes
takes
private
property
for
public
purposes
roads
and
streets
are
of
great
importance
to
the
general
public
and
the
government
of
the
town
or
city
in
which
you
live
may
see
fit
in
opening
a
new
street
to
run
it
across
your
garden
or
to
make
you
move
your
house
or
shop
out
of
the
way
for
it
in
so
doing
the
government
either
takes
away
or
damages
some
of
your
property
it
exercises
rights
over
your
property
without
asking
your
permission
this
power
of
government
over
private
property
is
called
the
right
of
eminent
domain
it
means
that
a
man
private
interests
must
not
be
allowed
to
obstruct
the
interests
of
the
whole
community
in
which
he
lives
but
in
two
ways
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain
is
unlike
taxation
in
the
first
place
it
is
only
occasional
and
affects
only
certain
persons
here
or
there
whereas
taxation
goes
on
perpetually
and
affects
all
persons
who
own
property
in
the
second
place
when
the
government
takes
away
a
piece
of
your
land
to
make
a
road
it
pays
you
money
in
return
for
it
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
as
you
believe
the
piece
of
land
was
worth
in
the
market
the
average
human
nature
is
doubtless
such
that
men
seldom
give
fair
measure
for
measure
unless
they
feel
compelled
to
and
it
is
not
easy
to
put
a
government
under
compulsion
still
it
gives
you
something
it
does
not
ask
you
to
part
with
your
property
for
nothing
now
in
the
case
of
taxation
the
government
takes
your
money
and
seems
to
make
no
return
to
you
individually
but
it
is
supposed
to
return
to
you
the
value
of
it
in
the
shape
of
streets
good
schools
efficient
protection
against
criminals
and
so
forth
sidenote
what
is
government
in
giving
this
brief
preliminary
definition
of
taxes
and
taxation
we
have
already
begun
to
speak
of
the
government
of
the
town
or
city
in
which
you
live
we
shall
presently
have
to
speak
of
other
governments
as
the
government
of
your
state
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
we
shall
now
and
then
have
occasion
to
allude
to
the
governments
of
other
countries
in
which
the
people
are
free
as
for
example
england
and
of
some
countries
in
which
the
people
are
not
free
as
for
example
russia
it
is
desirable
therefore
that
we
should
here
at
the
start
make
sure
what
we
mean
by
government
in
order
that
we
may
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
we
are
talking
about
sidenote
the
ship
of
state
our
verb
to
govern
is
an
old
french
word
one
of
the
great
host
of
french
words
which
became
a
part
of
the
english
language
between
the
eleventh
and
fourteenth
centuries
when
so
much
french
was
spoken
in
england
the
french
word
was
and
its
oldest
form
was
the
latin
a
word
which
the
romans
borrowed
from
the
greek
and
meant
originally
to
steer
the
ship
hence
it
very
naturally
came
to
mean
to
guide
to
direct
to
command
the
comparison
between
governing
and
steering
was
a
happy
one
to
govern
is
not
to
command
as
a
master
commands
a
slave
but
it
is
to
issue
orders
and
give
directions
for
the
common
good
for
the
interests
of
the
man
at
the
helm
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
people
in
the
ship
all
must
float
or
sink
together
hence
we
sometimes
speak
of
the
ship
of
state
and
we
often
call
the
state
a
commonwealth
or
something
in
the
weal
or
welfare
of
which
all
the
people
are
alike
interested
government
then
is
the
directing
or
managing
of
such
affairs
as
concern
all
the
people
alike
as
for
example
the
punishment
of
criminals
the
enforcement
of
contracts
the
defence
against
foreign
enemies
the
maintenance
of
roads
and
bridges
and
so
on
to
the
directing
or
managing
of
such
affairs
all
the
people
are
expected
to
contribute
each
according
to
his
ability
in
the
shape
of
taxes
government
is
something
which
is
supported
by
the
people
and
kept
alive
by
taxation
there
is
no
other
way
of
keeping
it
alive
sidenote
the
government
the
business
of
carrying
on
government
of
steering
the
ship
of
state
either
requires
some
special
training
or
absorbs
all
the
time
and
attention
of
those
who
carry
it
on
and
accordingly
in
all
countries
certain
persons
or
groups
of
persons
are
selected
or
in
some
way
set
apart
for
longer
or
shorter
periods
of
time
to
perform
the
work
of
government
such
persons
may
be
a
king
with
his
council
as
in
the
england
of
the
twelfth
century
or
a
parliament
led
by
a
responsible
ministry
as
in
the
england
of
or
a
president
and
two
houses
of
congress
as
in
the
united
states
or
a
board
of
selectmen
as
in
a
new
england
town
when
we
speak
of
a
government
or
the
government
we
often
mean
the
group
of
persons
thus
set
apart
for
carrying
on
the
work
of
government
thus
by
the
gladstone
government
we
mean
gladstone
with
his
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
and
his
liberal
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
and
by
the
lincoln
government
properly
speaking
was
meant
president
lincoln
with
the
republican
majorities
in
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
sidenote
whatever
else
it
may
be
the
government
is
the
power
which
taxes
the
government
has
always
many
things
to
do
and
there
are
many
different
lights
in
which
we
might
regard
it
but
for
the
present
there
is
one
thing
which
we
need
especially
to
keep
in
mind
the
government
is
the
power
which
can
rightfully
take
away
a
part
of
your
property
in
the
shape
of
taxes
to
be
used
for
public
purposes
a
government
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
and
can
not
long
be
kept
in
existence
unless
it
can
raise
money
by
taxation
and
use
force
if
necessary
in
collecting
its
taxes
the
only
general
government
of
the
united
states
during
the
revolutionary
war
and
for
six
years
after
its
close
was
the
continental
congress
which
had
no
authority
to
raise
money
by
taxation
in
order
to
feed
and
clothe
the
army
and
pay
its
officers
and
soldiers
it
was
obliged
to
for
money
from
the
several
states
and
hardly
ever
got
as
much
as
was
needed
it
was
obliged
to
borrow
millions
of
dollars
from
france
and
holland
and
to
issue
promissory
notes
which
soon
became
worthless
after
the
war
was
over
it
became
clear
that
this
government
could
neither
preserve
order
nor
pay
its
debts
and
accordingly
it
ceased
to
be
respected
either
at
home
or
abroad
and
it
became
necessary
for
the
american
people
to
adopt
a
new
form
of
government
between
the
old
continental
congress
and
the
government
under
which
we
have
lived
since
the
differences
were
many
but
by
far
the
most
essential
difference
was
that
the
new
government
could
raise
money
by
taxation
and
was
thus
enabled
properly
to
carry
on
the
work
of
governing
if
we
are
in
any
doubt
as
to
what
is
really
the
government
of
some
particular
country
we
can
not
do
better
than
observe
what
person
or
persons
in
that
country
are
clothed
with
authority
to
tax
the
people
mere
names
as
customarily
applied
to
governments
are
apt
to
be
deceptive
thus
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
france
and
england
were
both
called
kingdoms
but
so
far
as
kingly
power
was
concerned
louis
xv
was
a
very
different
sort
of
a
king
from
george
ii
the
french
king
could
impose
taxes
on
his
people
and
it
might
therefore
be
truly
said
that
the
government
of
france
was
in
the
king
indeed
it
was
louis
xv
immediate
predecessor
who
made
the
famous
remark
the
state
is
myself
but
the
english
king
could
not
impose
taxes
the
only
power
in
england
that
could
do
that
was
the
house
of
commons
and
accordingly
it
is
correct
to
say
that
in
england
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
government
was
as
it
still
is
in
the
house
of
commons
sidenote
difference
between
taxation
and
robbery
i
say
then
the
most
essential
feature
of
a
government
or
at
any
rate
the
feature
with
which
it
is
most
important
for
us
to
become
familiar
at
the
start

its
power
of
taxation
the
government
is
that
which
taxes
if
individuals
take
away
some
of
your
property
for
purposes
of
their
own
it
is
robbery
you
lose
your
money
and
get
nothing
in
return
but
if
the
government
takes
away
some
of
your
property
in
the
shape
of
taxes
it
is
supposed
to
render
to
you
an
equivalent
in
the
shape
of
good
government
something
without
which
our
lives
and
property
would
not
be
safe
herein
seems
to
lie
the
difference
between
taxation
and
robbery
when
the
highwayman
points
his
pistol
at
me
and
i
hand
him
my
purse
and
watch
i
am
robbed

when
i
pay
the
who
can
seize
my
watch
or
sell
my
house
over
my
head
if
i
refuse
i
am
simply
paying
what
is
fairly
due
from
me

supporting

have
been

has
thus
far
been
assumed
that
the
government
is
in
the
hands
of
upright
and
competent
men
and
is
properly
administered
it
is
now
time
to
observe
that
robbery
may
be
committed
by
governments
as
well
as
by
individuals
if
the
business
of
governing
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
men
who
have
an
imperfect
sense
of
their
duty
toward
the
public
if
such
men
raise
money
by
taxation
and
then
spend
it
on
their
own
pleasures
or
to
increase
their
political
influence
or
for
other
illegitimate
purposes
it
is
really
robbery
just
as
much
as
if
these
men
were
to
stand
with
pistols
by
the
roadside
and
empty
the
wallets
of
people
passing
by
they
make
a
dishonest
use
of
their
high
position

which
they
make
no
return

history
is
full
of
such
lamentable
instances
of
misgovernment
and
one
of
the
most
important
uses
of
the
study
of
history
is
to
teach
us
how
they
have
occurred
in

that
we
may
learn
how
to
avoid
them
as

as
possible

chapter
ii
the
township
section
new
england
of
the
various
kinds
of
government
to
be
found
in
the
united
states
we
may
begin
by
considering
that
of
the
new
england
township
as
we
shall
presently
see
it
is
in
principle
of
all
known
forms
of
government
the
oldest
as
well
as
the
simplest
let
us
observe
how
the
new
england
township
grew
up
sidenote
new
england
was
settled
by
church
congregations
when
people
from
england
first
came
to
dwell
in
the
wilderness
of
massachusetts
bay
they
settled
in
groups
upon
small
patches
of
land
which
soon
came
to
be
known
as
townships
there
were
several
reasons
why
they
settled
thus
in
small
groups
instead
of
scattering
about
over
the
country
and
carving
out
broad
estates
for
themselves
in
the
first
place
their
principal
reason
for
coming
to
new
england
was
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
in
which
church
affairs
were
managed
in
the
old
country
they
wished
to
bring
about
a
reform
in
the
church
in
such
wise
that
the
members
of
a
congregation
should
have
more
voice
than
formerly
in
the
and
that
the
minister
of
each
congregation
should
be
more
independent
than
formerly
of
the
bishop
and
of
the
civil
government
they
also
wished
to
abolish
sundry
rites
and
customs
of
the
church
of
which
they
had
come
to
disapprove
finding
the
resistance
to
their
reforms
quite
formidable
in
england
and
having
some
reason
to
fear
that
they
might
be
themselves
crushed
in
the
struggle
they
crossed
the
ocean
in
order
to
carry
out
their
ideas
in
a
new
and
remote
country
where
they
might
be
comparatively
secure
from
interference
hence
it
was
quite
natural
that
they
should
come
in
congregations
led
by
their
favourite
ministers
such
men
for
example
as
higginson
and
cotton
hooker
and
davenport
when
such
men
famous
in
england
for
their
bold
preaching
and
imperiled
thereby
decided
to
move
to
america
a
considerable
number
of
their
parishioners
would
decide
to
accompany
them
and
similarly
minded
members
of
neighbouring
churches
would
leave
their
own
pastor
and
join
in
the
migration
such
a
group
of
people
arriving
on
the
coast
of
massachusetts
would
naturally
select
some
convenient
locality
where
they
might
build
their
houses
near
together
and
all
go
to
the
same
church
sidenote
land
grants
this
migration
therefore
was
a
movement
not
of
individuals
or
of
separate
families
but
of
and
it
continued
to
be
so
as
the
settlers
made
their
way
inland
and
westward
the
first
river
towns
of
connecticut
were
founded
by
congregations
coming
from
dorchester
cambridge
and
watertown
this
kind
of
settlement
was
favoured
by
the
government
of
massachusetts
which
made
grants
of
land
not
to
individuals
but
to
companies
of
people
who
wished
to
live
together
and
attend
the
same
church
in
the
second
place
the
soil
of
new
england
was
not
favourable
to
the
cultivation
of
great
quantities
of
staple
articles
such
as
rice
or
tobacco
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
tempt
people
to
undertake
extensive
plantations
sidenote
small
farms
most
of
the
people
lived
on
small
farms
each
family
raising
but
little
more
than
enough
food
for
its
own
support
and
the
small
size
of
the
farms
made
it
possible
to
have
a
good
many
in
a
compact
neighbourhood
it
appeared
also
that
towns
could
be
more
easily
defended

this
doubtless
helped
to
keep
people
together

there
had
been
any
strong
inducement
for
solitary
pioneers
to
plunge
into
the

in

happened

social
positions
of

thus
the
early
settlers
of
new

came
to
live
in
townships
a
township
would
consist
of
about
as
many
farms
as
could
be
disposed
within
convenient
distance
from
the

all
the
inhabitants
young
and

against
the

the
latter

some
commanding

apt

hence
we
so
often
find

clustered

the
differences
in
what
we
should
call

though
noticeable
were
not
extreme
while
in

some
had
been

country
magistrates
or

phrase
which
does
not
mean
a
member
of
the
peerage
but
a
landed
proprietor
with
dependent
tenants
some
had
been
yeomen
or
persons
holding
farms
by
some
free
kind
of
tenure
some
had
been
artisans
or
tradesmen
in
cities
all
had
for
many
generations
been
more
or
less
accustomed
to
and
to
public
meetings
for
discussing
local
affairs
that
especially
as
far
as
church
matters
were
concerned
they
were
stoutly
bent
upon
maintaining
and
extending
indeed
that
was
what
they
had
crossed
the
ocean
for
under
these
circumstances
they
developed
a
kind
of
government
which
we
may
describe
in
the
present
tense
for
its
methods
are
pretty
much
the
same
that
they
were
two
centuries
ago

seven
or
nine
in
number
according
to
the
size
of
the

and
the
amount
of

transacted
the
odd
number
insures
a
majority
decision
in
case
of
any
difference
of

among
them
they
have
the
general
management
of

they
can
call
such
a

at
any
time
during
the

when
there
seems
to
be
need
for
it
but
the
warrant
must
always
specify
the
subjects
which
are
to
be
discussed
and
acted
on
at
the
meeting
the
selectmen
also
lay
out
highways
grant
licenses
and
impanel
jurors
they
may
act
as
health
officers
and
issue
orders
regarding
sewerage
the
abatement
of
nuisances
or
the
isolation
of
contagious
diseases
in
many
cases
they
act
as
assessors
of
taxes
and
as
overseers
of
the

they
are
the
proper
persons
to
listen
to
complaints
if
anything
goes

may
be
said
to
be

he
records
the

and
deaths
in

township
and
issues
certificates
to
persons
who
declare
an
intention
of
marriage
he
likewise
keeps
on
record
accurate
descriptions
of
the
position
and
bounds
of
public
roads
and
in
short
has
general
charge
of
all
matters

has
also
its
treasurer
who
receives
and
takes
care
of
the
money
coming
in
from
the
taxpayers
or
whatever
money
belongs
to
the
town
out

every
town

or
more

who
serve

from
the
law
courts
they
pursue
criminals
and
take
them
to
jail
they
summon
jurors
in
many
towns
they
serve
as
collectors
of
taxes
but
in
many
other
towns
a
special
officer
is
chosen
for
that
purpose
when
a
person
fails
to
pay
his
taxes
after
a
specified
time
the
collector
has
authority
to
seize
upon
his
property
and

it
at

and

out
of

proceeds
of

over
the
balance
to
the
owner
in
some
cases
where
no

can
be
found
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
delinquent
is
not
acting
in
good
faith
he
can
be
arrested
and
kept
in

until
the

has
its

of

enacted
a
law
with
the
following
preamble
it
being
one
chief
project
of
that
old
deluder
satan
to
keep
men
from
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
as
in
former
times
by
keeping
them
in
an
unknown
tongue
so
in
these
latter
times
by
persuading
from
the
use
of
tongues
that
so
at
least
the
true
sense
and
meaning
of
the
original
might
be
clouded
and
corrupted
with
false
glosses
of
deceivers
to
the
end
that
learning
may
not
be
buried
in
the
graves
of
our
forefathers
in
church
and
commonwealth
the
lord
assisting
our
endeavours
it
was
therefore
ordered
that
every
township
containing
fifty
families
or
householders
should
forthwith
set
up
a
school
in
which
children
might
be
taught
to
read

and
that
every
township
containing
one
hundred
families

should
set
up

might
be
fitted
for

town
country
and
state
taxes
at
this
meeting
the
amount
of
money
to
be
raised
by
taxation
for
town
purposes
is
determined
but
as
we
shall
see
every
inhabitant
of
a
town
lives
not
only
under
a
town
government
but
also
under
a
county
government
and
a
state
government
and
all
these
governments
have
to
be
supported
by
taxation
in
massachusetts
the
state
and
the
county
make
use
of
the
machinery
of
the
town
government
in
order
to
assess
and
collect
their
taxes
the
total
amounts
to
be
raised
are
equitably
divided
among
the
several
towns
and
cities
so
that
each
town
pays
its
proportionate
share
each
year
therefore
the
town
assessors
know
that
a
certain
amount
of
money
must
be
raised
from
the
taxpayers
of
their
town
partly
for
the
town
partly
for
the
county
partly
for
the
state
and
for
the
general
convenience
they
usually
assess
it
upon
the
taxpayers
all
at
once
the
amounts
raised
for
the
state
and
county
are
usually
very
much
smaller
than
the
amount
raised
for
the
town
as
these
amounts
are
all
raised
in
the
town
and
by
town
officers
we
shall
find
it
convenient
to
sum
up
in
this
place
what
we
have
to
say
about
the
way
in
which
taxes
are
raised
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
still
considering
the
new
england
system
and
our
illustration
is
taken
from
the
practice
in
massachusetts
but
the
general
principles
of
taxation
are
so
similar
in
the
different
states
that
although
we
may
now
and
then
have
to
point
to
differences
of
detail
we
shall
not
need
to
go
over
the
whole
subject
again
we
have
now
to
observe
how
and
upon
whom
the
taxes
are
assessed
sidenote
they
are
assessed
partly
upon
persons
but
chiefly
upon
property
and
property
is
divisible
into
real
estate
and
personal
estate
the
tax
assessed
upon
persons
is
called
the
and
can
not
exceed
the
sum
of
two
dollars
upon
every
male
citizen
over
twenty
years
old
in
cases
of
extreme
poverty
the
assessors
may
remit
the
sidenote
taxes
as
to
real
estate
there
are
in
every
town
some
lands
and
buildings
which
for
reasons
of
public
policy
are
exempted
from
paying
taxes
as
for
example
churches
graveyards
and
tombs
many
charitable
institutions
including
universities
and
colleges
and
public
buildings
which
belong
to
the
state
or
to
the
united
states
all
lands
and
buildings
except
such
as
are
exempt
by
law
must
pay
taxes
sidenote
taxes
on
personal
property
personal
property
includes
pretty
much
everything
that
one
can
own
except
lands
and
buildings
pretty
much
everything
that
can
be
moved
or
carried
about
from
one
place
to
another
it
thus
includes
ready
money
stocks
and
bonds
ships
and
wagons
furniture
pictures
and
books
it
also
includes
the
amount
of
debts
due
to
a
person
in
excess
of
the
amount
that
he
owes
also
the
income
from
his
employment
whether
in
the
shape
of
profits
from
business
or
a
fixed
salary
some
personal
property
is
exempted
from
taxation
as
for
example
household
furniture
to
the
amount
of
in
value
and
income
from
employment
to
the
extent
of
the
obvious
intent
of
this
exemption
is
to
prevent
taxation
from
bearing
too
hard
upon
persons
of
small
means
and
for
a
similar
reason
the
tools
of
farmers
and
mechanics
are
exempted
footnote
united
states
bonds
are
also
especially
exempted
from
taxation
sidenote
when
and
where
taxes
are
assessed
the
date
at
which
property
is
annually
reckoned
for
assessment
is
in
massachusetts
the
first
day
of

the

assessed
upon
each
person
in
the
town
or
city
where
he
has
his
legal
habitation
on
that
day
and
as
a
general
rule
the
taxes
upon
his
personal
property
are
assessed
to
him
in
the
same
place
but
taxes
upon
lands
or
buildings
are
assessed
in
the
city
or
town
where
they
are
situated
and
to
the
person
wherever
he
lives
who
is
the
owner
of
them
on
the
first
day
of
may
thus
a
man
who
lives
in
the
berkshire
mountains
say
for
example
in

town
of

will
pay
his
to
that
town

his
personal

the
most
approved

is
for

to
each

list

with

this

observe
here
an
important
difference
between
the
imposition
of
taxes
upon
real
estate
and
upon
personal
property
houses
and
lands
can
not
run
away
or
be
tucked
out
of
sight
their
value
too
is
something
of
which
the
assessors
can
very
likely
judge
as
well
as
the
owner
deception
is
therefore
extremely
difficult
and
taxation
for
real
estate
is
pretty
fairly
distributed
among
the
different
owners
with
regard
to
personal
estate
it
is
very
different
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
conceal
one
ownership
of
some
kinds
of
personal
property
or
to
understate
one
income
hence
the
temptation
to
lessen
the
burden
of
the
tax
bill
by
making
false
statements
is
considerable
and
doubtless
a
good
deal
of
deception
is
practised
there
are
many
people
who
are
too
honest
to
cheat
individuals
but
still
consider
it
a
venial
sin
to
cheat

after
the
assessors
have
obtained
all
their
returns
they
can
calculate
the
total
value
of
the
taxable
property
in
the
town
and
knowing
the
amount
of
the
tax
to
be
raised
it
is
easy
to
calculate
the
rate
at
which
the
tax
is
to
be
assessed
in
most
parts
of
the
united
states
a
rate
of
one
and
a
half
per
cent

tax
on

worth
of
property
would
be
regarded
as
moderate
three

be
regarded
as
excessively
high

of
these
rates
a
man
worth
would
pay
for

taxes

the
tax
is
seldom
quite
as
heavy
as
this
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
exactly
how
much
a
man
is
worth
and
accordingly
assessors
not
wishing
to
be
too
disagreeable
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
have
naturally
fallen
into
a
way
of
giving
the
lower
valuation
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
until
in
many
places
a
custom
has
grown
up
of
regularly
undervaluing
property
for
purposes
of
taxation
very
much
as
liquid
measures
have
gradually
shrunk
until
it
takes
five
quart
bottles
to
hold
a
gallon
so
there
has
been
a
shrinkage
of
valuations
until
it
has
become
common
to
tax
a
man
for
only
three
fourths
or
perhaps
two
thirds
of
what
his
property
is
worth
in
the
market
this
makes
the
rate
higher
to
be
sure
but
the
individual
taxpayer
nevertheless
seems
to
feel
relieved
by
it
allowing
for
this
undervaluation
we
may
say
that
a
man
worth
commonly
pays
not
less
than
for
his
yearly
taxes
or
about
one
fifth
of
the
annual
income
of
the
property
we
thus
begin
to
see
what
a
heavy
burden
taxes
are
and
how
essential
to
good
government
it
is
that
citizens
should
know

their

goes
for

the

thus
brought
under
the
sway
of
great
lords
came
to
be
generally
known
by
the
french
name
of
manors
or
dwelling
places
much
might
be
said
about
this
change
but
here
it
is
enough
for
us
to
bear
in
mind
that
a
manor
was
essentially
a
township
in
which
the
chief
executive
officers
were
directly
responsible
to
the
lord
rather
than
to
the
people
it
would
be
wrong
however
to
suppose
that
the
manors
entirely
lost
their
even
the
ancient
survived
in
them
in
a
fragmentary
way
in
several
interesting
assemblies
of
which
the
most
interesting
were
the
for
the
election
of
certain
officers
and
the
trial
of
petty
offences
and
the
which
was
much
like
a
sidenote
the
parish
still
more
of
the
old
would
doubtless
have
survived
in
the
institutions
of
the
manor
if
it
had
not
been
provided
for
in
another
way
the
was
older
than
the
manor
after
the
english
had
been
converted
to
christianity
local
churches
were
gradually
set
up
all
over
the
country
and
districts
called
parishes
were
assigned
for
the
ministrations
of
the
priests
now
a
parish
generally
coincided
in
area
with
a
township
or
sometimes
with
a
group
of
two
or
three
townships
in
the
old
heathen
times
each
town
seems
to
have
had
its
sacred
place
or
shrine
consecrated
to
some
local
deity
and
it
was
a
favourite
policy
with
the
roman
missionary
priests
to
purify
the
old
shrine
and
turn
it
into
a
church
in
this
way
the
township
at
the
same
time
naturally
became
the

as
we
find
it
in
later
times
both
before
and
since
the
founding
of
english
colonies
in
north
america
the
township
in
england
is
likely
to
be
both
a
manor
and
a
parish
for
some
purposes
it
is
the

some
purposes
it
is
the

the
townsfolk
may
be
regarded
as
a
group
of
tenants
of
the
lord
manor
or
as
a
group
of
parishioners
of
the
local
church
in
the
latter
aspect
the
parish
retained
much
of
the
of
the
ancient
town
the
business
with
which
the
lord
was
entitled
to
meddle
was
strictly
limited
and
all
other
business
was
transacted
in
the
which
was
practically
the
old
under
a
new
name
in
the
course
of
the
thirteenth
century
we
find
that
the
parish
had
acquired
the
right
of
taxing
itself
for
church
purposes
money
needed
for
the
church
was
supplied
in
the
form
of
voted
by
the
ratepayers
themselves
in
the
so
called

it
was
originally
held
in
a

of

the

surveyors
of
highways
the
haywards
or
the
common

the
collectors
of
taxes
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
overseers
of
the
poor
were
added
there
were
also
churchwardens
usually
two
for
each

were
primarily
to

also
acted
as
overseers
of

thus
in
several
ways
remind
one
of
the

the

were
all
elected
by
the

sidenote
the
transition
from
england
to
new
england
during
the
last
two
centuries
the
constitution
of
the
english
parish
has
undergone
some
modifications
which
need
not
here
concern
us
the
puritans
who
settled
in
new
england
had
grown
up
under
such
parish
government
as
is
here
described
and
they
were
used
to
hearing
the
parish
called
on
some
occasions
and
for
some
purposes
a
township
if
we
remember
now
that
the
earliest
new
england
towns
were
founded
by
church
congregations
led
by
their
pastors
we
can
see
how
town
government
in
new
england
originated
it
was
simply
the
english
parish
government
brought
into
a
new
country
and
adapted
to
the
new
situation
part
of
this
new
situation
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
lords
of
the
manor
were
left
behind
there
was
no
longer
any
occasion
to
distinguish
between
the
township
as
a
manor
and
the
township
as
a
parish
and
so
as
the
three
names
had
all
lived
on
together
side
by
side
in
england
it
was
now
the
oldest
and
most
generally
descriptive
name
township
that
survived
and
has
come
into
use
throughout
a
great
part
of
the
united
states
the
townsfolk
went
on
making
voting
supplies
of
public
money
and
electing
their
magistrates
in
america
after
the
fashion
with
which
they
had
for
ages
been
familiar
in
england
some
of
their
offices
and
customs
were
of
hoary
antiquity
if
age
gives
respectability
the
office
of
constable
may
vie
with
that
of
king
and
if
the
annual
is
usually
held
in
the
month
of
march
it
is
because
in
days
of
old
long
before
magna
charta
was
thought
of
the
rules
and
regulations
for
the
village
husbandry
were
discussed
and
adopted

complete
our
sketch
of
the
origin
of
the
new
england
town
one
point
should
here
be
briefly
mentioned
in
anticipation
of
what
will
have
to
be
said
hereafter
but
it
is
a
point
of
so
much
importance
that
we
need
not
mind
a
little
repetition
in
stating
it
sidenote
representation
we
have
seen
what
a
great
part
taxation
plays
in
the
business
of
government
and
we
shall
presently
have
to
treat
of
county
state
and
federal
governments
all
of
them
wider
in
their
sphere
than
the
town
government
in
the
course
of
history
as
nations
have
gradually
been
built
up
these
wider
governments
have
been
apt
to
absorb
or
supplant
and
crush
the
narrower
governments
such
as
the
parish
or
township
and
this
process
has
too
often
been
destructive
to
political
freedom
such
a
result
is
of
course
disastrous
to
everybody
and
if
it
were
unavoidable
it
would
be
better
that
great
national
governments
need
never
be
formed
but
it
is
not
unavoidable
there
is
one
way
of
escaping
it
and
that
is
to
give
the
little
government
of
the
town
some
real
share
in
making
up
the
great
government
of
the
state
that
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
most
peoples
have
failed
in
the
attempt
the
people
who
speak
the
english
language
have
been
the
most
successful
and
the
device
by
which
they
have
overcome
the
difficulty
is
representation
the
town
sends
to
the
wider
government
a
delegation
of
persons
who
can
the
town
and
its
people
they
can
speak
for
the
town
and
have
a
voice
in
the
framing
of
laws
and
imposition
of
taxes
by
the
wider
government

in

there
has
been
from
time
immemorial
a
system
of
representation
long
before
alfred
time
there
were
or
what
were
afterwards
called
county
meetings
and
to
these
each
town
sent
its
reeve
and
four
discreet
men
as
thus
to
a
certain
extent
the
wishes
of
the
townsfolk
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
county
affairs
by
and
by
this
method
was
applied
on
a
much
wider
scale
it
was
applied
to
the
whole
kingdom
so
that
the
people
of
all
its
towns
and
parishes
succeeded
in
securing
a
representation
of
their
interests
in
an
elective
national
council
or
house
of
commons
this
great
work
was
accomplished
in
the
thirteenth

was
these
dates
have
as
much
interest
for
americans
as
for
englishmen
because
they
mark
the
first
definite
establishment
of
that
grand
system
of
representative
government
which
we
are
still
carrying
on
at
our
various
state
capitals
and
at
washington
for
its
humble
beginnings
we
have
to
look
back
to
the

and

sent
by
the
ancient
townships
to
the
county

sidenote
township
as
unit
of
representation
the
english
township
or
parish
was
thus
at
an
early
period
the
unit
of
representation
in
the
government
of
the
county
it
was
also
a
district
for
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
national
taxes
in
each
parish
the
assessment
was
made
by
a
board
of
assessors
chosen
by
popular
vote
these
essential
points
reappear
in
the
early
history
of
new
england
the
township
was
not
only
a
body
but
it
was
the
unit
of
representation
in
the
colonial
legislature
or
general
court
and
the
assessment
of
taxes
whether
for
town
purposes
or
for
state
purposes
was
made
by
assessors
elected
by
the
townsfolk
in
its
beginnings
and
fundamentals
our
political
liberty
did
not
originate
upon
american
soil
but
was
brought
hither
by
our
forefathers
the
first
settlers
they
brought
their
political
institutions
with
them
as
naturally
as
they
brought
their
language
and
their
social
customs
sidenote
the
russian
village
community
not
represented
in
the
national
government
observe
now
that
the
township
is
to
be
regarded
in
two
lights
it
must
be
considered
not
only
in
itself
but
as
part
of
a
greater
whole
we
began
by
describing
it
as
a
body
but
in
order
to
complete
our
sketch
we
were
obliged
to
speak
of
it
as
a
body
which
has
a
share
in
the
government
of
the
state
and
the
nation
the
latter
aspect
is
as
important
as
the
former
if
the
people
of
a
town
had
only
the
power
of
managing
their
local
affairs
without
the
power
of
taking
part
in
the
management
of
national
affairs
their
political
freedom
would
be
far
from
complete
in
russia
for
example
the
larger
part
of
the
vast
population
is
resident
in
village
communities
which
have
to
a
considerable
extent
the
power
of
managing
their
local
affairs
such
a
village
community
is
called
a
and
like
the
english
township
it
is
lineally
descended
from
the
stationary
clan
the
people
of
the
russian
hold
meetings
in
which
they
elect
sundry
local
officers
distribute
the
burden
of
local
taxation
make
regulations
concerning
local
husbandry
and
police
and
transact
other
business
which
need
not
here
concern
us
but
they
have
no
share
in
the
national
government
and
are
obliged
to
obey
laws
which
they
have
no
voice
in
making
and
pay
taxes
assessed
upon
them
without
their
consent
and
accordingly
we
say
with
truth
that
the
russian
people
do
not
possess
political
freedom
one
reason
for
this
has
doubtless
been
that
in
times
past
the
russian
territory
was
the
great
frontier
between
civilized
europe
and
the
wild
hordes
of
western
asia
and
the
people
who
lived
for
ages
on
that
turbulent
frontier
were
subjected
to
altogether
too
much
conquest
they
have
tasted
too
little
of
civil
government
and
too
much
of
military
government

pennyworth

an
intolerable
deal
of
sack
the
early
english
in
their
snug
little
corner
of
the
world
belted
by
salt
sea
were
able
to
develop
their
civil
government
with
less
destructive
interference
they
made
a
sound
and
healthful
beginning
when
they
made
the
township
the
unit
of
representation
for
the
county
then
the
township
besides
managing
its

affairs
began
to

the
county
section
county
in
its
it
is
now
time
for
us
to
treat
of
the
county
and
we
may
as
well
begin
by
considering
its
origin
in
treating
of
the
township
we
began
by
sketching
it
in
its
fullest
development
as
seen
in
new
england
with
the
county
we
shall
find
it
helpful
to
pursue
a
different
method
and
start
at
the
beginning
if
we
look
at
the
maps
of
the
states
which
make
up
our
union
we
see
that
they
are
all
divided
into
counties
except
that
in
louisiana
the
corresponding
divisions
are
named
parishes
the
map
of
england
shows
that
country
as
similarly
divided
into
counties
sidenote
why
do
we
have
counties
if
we
ask
why
this
is
so
some
people
will
tell
us
that
it
is
convenient
for
purposes
of
administration
to
have
a
state
or
a
kingdom
divided
into
areas
that
are
larger
than
single
towns
there
is
much
truth
in
this
it
is
convenient
if
it
were
not
so
counties
would
not
have
survived
so
as
to
make
a
part
of
our
modern
maps
nevertheless
this
is
not
the
historic
reason
why
we
have
the
particular
kind
of
subdivisions
known
as
counties
we
have
them
because
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
them
and
thus
if
we
would
find
out
the
true
reason
we
may
as
well
go
back
to
the
ancient
times
when
our
forefathers
were
establishing
themselves
in
england
sidenote
clans
and
tribes
we
have
seen
how
the
clan
of
our
barbarous
ancestors
when
it
became
stationary
was
established
as
the
town
or
township
but
in
those
early
times
were
generally
united
more
or
less
closely
into
among
all
primitive
or
barbarous
races
of
men
so
far
as
we
can
make
out
society
is
organized
in
tribes
and
each
tribe
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
clans
or
family
groups
now
when
our
english
forefathers
conquered
britain
they
settled
there
as
clans
and
also
as
tribes
the
clans
became
townships
and
the
tribes
became
shires
or
counties
that
is
to
say
the
names
were
applied
first
to
the
people
and
afterwards
to
the
land
they
occupied
a
few
of
the
oldest
county
names
in
england
still
show
this
plainly
and
were
originally
east
saxons
middle
saxons
and
south
saxons
and
on
the
eastern
coast
two
tribes
of
angles
were
distinguished
as
north
folk
and
south
folk
or
and
when
you
look
on
the
map
and
see
the
town
of
in
the
county
of
it
means
that
this
place
was
once
known
as
the
home
of
the
icklings
or
children
of
ickel
a
clan
which
formed
part
of
the
tribe
of
south
folk
sidenote
the
english
nation
like
the
american
grew
out
of
the
union
of
small
states
in
those
days
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
kingdom
of
england
there
were
only
these
groups
of
tribes
living
side
by
side
each
tribe
had
its
leader
whose
title
was
or
elder
man
after
a
while
as
some
tribes
increased
in
size
and
power
their
ealdormen
took
the
title
of
kings
the
little
kingdoms
coincided
sometimes
with
a
single
shire
sometimes
with
two
or
more
shires
thus
there
was
a
kingdom
of
kent
and
the
north
and
south
folk
were
combined
in
a
kingdom
of
east
anglia
in
course
of
time
numbers
of
shires
combined
into
larger
kingdoms
such
as
northumbria
mercia
and
the
west
saxons
and
finally
the
king
of
the
west
saxons
became
king
of
all
england
and
the
several
became
subordinate
parts
or
shares
of
the
kingdom
in
england
therefore
the
shires
are
older
than
the
nation
the
shires
were
not
made
by
dividing
the
nation
but
the
nation
was
made
by
uniting
the
shires
the
english
nation
like
the
american
grew
out
of
the
union
of
little
states
that
had
once
been
independent
of
one
another
but
had
many
interests
in
common
for
not
less
than
three
hundred
years
after
all
england
had
been
united
under
one
king
these
shires
retained
their
almost
as
completely
as
the
several
states
of
the
american
union
a
few
words
about
their
government
will
not
be
wasted
for
they
will
help
to
throw
light
upon
some
things
that
still
form
a
part
of
our
political
and
social
life

the
shire
was
governed
by
the
meeting
which
was
a
representative
body
lords
of
lands
including
abbots
and
priors
attended
it
as
well
as
the
reeve
and
four
selected
men
from
each
township
there
were
thus
the
germs
of
both
the
kind
of
representation
that
is
seen
in
the
house
of
lords
and
the
much
more
perfect
kind
that
is

in

grew

the

court
this
was
both
a
legislative
body

a
court
of
justice
it
not
only
made
laws
for

shire

it
tried
civil
and
criminal
causes
after
the
norman
conquest
some
changes
occurred
the
shire
now
began
to
be
called
by
the
french
name
county
because
of
its
analogy
to
the
small
pieces
of
territory
on
the
continent
that
were
governed
by
counts
the
became
known
as
the
county
court
but
cases
coming
before
it
were
tried
by
the
king
in

circuit
judges
who
went
about
from
county
to
county
to
preside
over
the
judicial
work
the
office
of
ealdorman
became
extinct
the
sheriff
was
no
longer
elected
by
the
people
for
life
but
appointed
by
the
king
for
the
term
of
one
year
this
kept
him
strictly
responsible
to
the
king
it
was
the
sheriff
duty
to
see
that
the
county
share
of
the
national
taxes
was
duly
collected
and
paid
over
to
the
national
treasury
the
sheriff
also
summoned
juries
and
enforced
the
judgments
of
the
courts
and
if
he
met
with
resistance
in
so
doing
he
was
authorized
to
call
out
a
force
of
men
known
as
the
power
of

overcome
all
opposition
another
county
officer
was
the
or
so
called
because
originally
in
time

was
appointed
by

sudden
death

in

of

the
class
of
cases

death
occurred
under

during

the

county
has
gradually
sunk
from
a
community
into
an
administrative
district

in
recent
times
its
boundaries
have
been
so
crossed
and
crisscrossed
with
those
of
other
administrative
areas
such
as
those
of
sanitary
boards
that
very
little
of
the
old
county
is
left
in
recognizable
shape
most
of
this
change
has
been
effected
since
the
tudor
period
the
first
english
settlers
in
america
were
familiar
with
the
county
as
a
district
for
the
administration
of
justice
and
they
brought
with

coroners

old
english
fashion
the
militia

virginia
sparsely

the
first
point
to
be
noticed
in
the
early
settlement
of
virginia
is
that
people
did
not
live
so
near
together
as
in
new
england
this
was
because
tobacco
cultivated
on
large
estates
was
a
source
of
wealth
tobacco
drew
settlers
to
virginia
as
in
later
days
gold
drew
settlers
to
california
and
sparsely
australia
they
came
not
in
organized
groups
or
congregations
but
as
a
multitude
of
individuals
land
was
granted
to
individuals
and
sometimes
these
grants
were
of
enormous
extent
john
bolling
who
died
in
left
an
estate
of
acres
and
this
is
not
mentioned
as
an
extraordinary
amount
of
land
for
one
man
to
own
from
an
early
period
it
was
customary
to
keep
these
great
estates
together
by
entailing
them
and
this
continued
until
entails
were
abolished

it

for

at

have
each

a

and
receive

the

of
tobacco
upon

caused
a
great
demand
for
cheap
labour
and
this
was
supplied
partly
by
bringing
negro
slaves
from
africa
partly
by
bringing
criminals
from
english
jails
the
latter
were
sold
into
slavery
for
a
limited
term
of
years
and
were
known
as
indentured

servants
so
great
was
the
demand
for

it
became

poor

on

them
off

were

there
was
an
insurmountable

between
the
owners

this
class
was
originally
formed
of
men

had
been

was
increased
by
such
shiftless

prevent

the

with
its

was
reproduced
in
virginia
under
the

name
but
with
some
noteworthy
peculiarities
if
the
whole
body
of
ratepayers
had
assembled
in
vestry
meeting
to
enact
and
assess
taxes
the
course
of
development
would
have
been
like
that
of
the
new
england
but
instead
of
this
the
vestry
which
exercised
the
chief
authority
in
the
parish
was
composed
of
twelve
chosen
men
this
was
not
government
by
a
primary
assembly
it
was
representative
government
at
first
the
twelve
vestrymen
were
elected
by
the
people
of
the
parish
and
thus
resembled
the
selectmen
of
new
england
but
after
a
while
they
obtained
the
power
of
filling
vacancies
in
their
own
number
so
that
they
became
what
is
called
a
close
corporation
and
the
people
had
nothing
to
do
with
choosing
them
strictly
speaking
that
was

his

the

see
that
the

the
people
had
little
directly
to
do
nevertheless
in
these
small
neighbourhoods
government
was
in
full
sight

proceedings
went
on
in

daylight
and
were

of
some
one

they
are
well

they
find
sufficient
inducements

the
difference
however
between
the
new
england
township
and
the
virginia
parish
in
respect
of
was
striking
enough
we
have
now
to
note
a
further
difference
in
new
england
as
we
have
seen
the
township
was
the
unit
of
representation
in
the
colonial
legislature
but
in
virginia
the
parish
was
not
the
unit
of
representation
the
county
was
that
unit
in
the
colonial
legislature
of
virginia
the
representatives
sat
not
for
parishes
but
for
counties
the
difference
is
very
significant
as
the
political
life
of
new
england
was
in
a
manner
built
up
out
of
the
political
life
of
the
towns
so
the
political
life
of
virginia
was
built
up
out
of
the
political
life
of
the
counties
this
was
partly
because
the
vast
plantations
were
not
grouped
about
a
compact
village
nucleus
like
the
small
farms
at
the
north
and
partly
because
there
was
not
in
virginia
that
puritan
theory
of
the
church
according
to
which
each
congregation
is
a
democracy
the
conditions
which
made
the
new
england
were
absent
the
only
alternative
was
some
kind
of
representative
government
and
for
this
the
county
was
a
small
enough
area
the
county
in
virginia
was
much
smaller
than
in
massachusetts
or
connecticut
in
a
few
instances
the
county
consisted
of
only
a
single
parish
in
some
cases
it
was
divided
into
two
parishes
but
oftener
into
three

more
sidenote
the
county
court
was
virtually
a
close
corporation
in
virginia
as
in
england
and
in
new
england
the
county
was
an
area
for
the
administration
of
justice
there
were
usually
in
each
county
eight
justices
of
the
peace
and
their
court
was
the
counterpart
of
the
quarter
sessions
in
england
they
were
appointed
by
the
governor
but
it
was
customary
for
them
to
nominate
candidates
for
the
governor
to
appoint
so
that
practically
the
court
filled
its
own
vacancies
and
was
a
close
corporation
like
the
parish
vestry
such
an
arrangement
tended
to
keep
the
general
supervision
and
control
of
things
in
the
hands
of
a
few
families
this
county
court
usually
met
as
often
as
once
a

in
some
convenient
spot
answering
to

the

and
in
civil
suits
where
the
sum
at

exceeded

smaller
suits
could
be
tried
by
a
single
justice
the
court
also
had

of
the
probate
and

the
court
appointed
its
own
clerk
who
kept
the
county
records
it
superintended
the
construction
and
repair
of
bridges
and
highways
and
for
this
purpose
divided
the
county
into
precincts
and
appointed
annually
for
each
precinct
a
highway
surveyor
the
court
also
seems
to
have
appointed
constables
one
for
each
precinct
the
justices
could
themselves
act
as
coroners
but
annually
two
or
more
coroners
for
each
parish
were
appointed
by
the
governor
as
we
have
seen
that
the
parish
taxes
so
much

clerk
so
much
for

of
church
buildings
so
much

coroner

to
the

the
general

the

the
taxes
for
the

sometimes
the

also
were
collected
by
the
sheriff
they
were
usually
paid
not
in
money
but
in
tobacco
and
the
sheriff
was
the
custodian
of
this
tobacco
responsible
for
its
proper
disposal
the
sheriff
was
thus
not
only
the
officer
for
executing
the
judgments
of
the
court
but
he
was
also
county
treasurer
and
collector
and
thus
exercised
powers
almost
as
great
as
those
of
the
sheriff
in
england
in
the
twelfth
century
he
also
presided
over
elections
for
representatives
to
the

it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
this
very
important
officer
was
chosen
each
year
the

presented
the
names
of

and
county
government
as
illustrated
in
new

on
the
one
hand
and
in
virginia
on
the
other
there
are
some
important
points
in
the
early
history
of
local
government
in
other
portions
of
the
original
thirteen
states
to
which
we
must
next
call
attention
and
then
we
shall
be
prepared
to
understand
the
manner
in
which
our
great
western
country
has
been
organized
under
civil
government
we
must
first
say
something
about
south
carolina
and
maryland
sidenote
parishes
in
south
carolina
south
carolina
was
settled
from
half
a
century
to
a
century
later
than
massachusetts
and
virginia
and
by
two
distinct
streams
of
immigration
the
lowlands
near
the
coast
were
settled
by
englishmen
and
by
french
huguenots
but
the
form
of
government
was
purely
english
there
were
parishes
as
in
virginia
but
popular
election
played
a
greater
part
in
them
the
vestrymen
were
elected
yearly
by
all
the
taxpayers
of
the
parish
the
minister
was
also
elected
by
his
people
and
after
each
parish
sent
its
representatives
to
the
colonial
legislature
though
in
a
few
instances
two
parishes
were
joined
together
for
the
purpose
of
choosing
representatives
the
system
was
thus
more
democratic
than
in
virginia
and
in
this
connection
it
is
worth
while
to
observe
that
parochial
libraries
and
free
schools
were
established
as
early
as
much
earlier
than
in
virginia
sidenote
the
back
country
during
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
very
different
stream
of
immigration
coming
mostly
along
the
slope
of
the
alleghanies
from
virginia
and
pennsylvania
and
consisting
in
great
part
of
germans
scotch
highlanders
and
peopled
the
upland
western
regions
of
south
carolina
for
some
time
this
territory
had
scarcely
any
civil
organization
it
was
a
kind
of
wild
west
there
were
as
yet
no
counties
in
the
colony
there
was
just
one
sheriff
for
the
whole
colony
who
held
his
office
by
patent
from
the
crown
a
court
sat
in
charleston
but
the
arm
of
justice
was
hardly
long
enough
to
reach
offenders
in
the
mountains
to
punish
a
or
prosecute
a
debtor
one
was
sometimes
compelled
to
travel
a
distance
of
several
hundred
miles
and
be
subjected
to
all
the
dangers
and
delays
incident
to
a
wild
country
when
people
can
not
get
justice
in
what
in
civilized
countries
is
the
regular
way
they
will
get
it
in
some
irregular
way
so
these
mountaineers
began
to
form
themselves
into
bands
known
as
regulators
quite
like
the
vigilance
committees
formed
for
the
same
purposes
in
california
a
hundred
years
later
for
thieves
and
murderers
the
regulators
provided
a
speedy

the

the

divided
the

into
districts
each
with
its

and
the
judges

sent
on

through
these
districts
the
upland
region
with
its
districts
was
thus
very
differently
organized
from
the
lowland
region
with
its
parishes
and
the
effect
was
for
a
while
almost
like
dividing
south
carolina
into
two
states
at
first
the
districts
were
not
allowed
to
choose
their
own
sheriffs
but
in
course
of
time
they
acquired
this
privilege
it
was
difficult
to
apportion
the
representation
in
the
state
legislature
so
as
to
balance
evenly
the
districts
in
the
west
against
the
parishes
in
the
east
and
accordingly
there
was
much
dissatisfaction
especially
in
the
west
which
did
not
get
its
fair
share
in
the
capital
was
moved
from
charleston
to
columbia
as
a
concession
to
the
back
country
and
in
a
kind
of
compromise
was
effected
in
such
wise
that
the
uplands
secured
a
permanent
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
while
the
lowlands
retained
control
of
the
senate
the
two
sections
had
each
its
separate
state
treasurer

but
soon
afterward
by
the
new
constitution
of
the
districts
were
abolished
and
the
state
was
divided
into
counties
each
of
which
sends
one
senator
to
the
state
senate

they
send

their

the
people
elect

a

a

a

a

in
one
respect
the
south
carolina
county
is
quite
peculiar
it
has
no
organization
for
judicial
purposes
the
counties
like
their
institutional
predecessor
the
district
are
grouped
into
judicial
circuits
and

is
elected

trial

are
appointed
by
the

for
a
term
of
two
years
sidenote
the
counties
are
too
large
this
system
like
the
simple
county
system
everywhere
is
a
representative
system
the
people
take
no
direct
part
in
the
management
of
affairs
in
one
respect
it
seems
obviously
to
need
amendment
in
states
where
county
government
has
grown
up
naturally
after
the
virginia
fashion
the
county
is
apt
to
be
much
smaller
than
in
states
where
it
is
simply
a
district
embracing
several
township
governments
thus
the
average
size
of
a
county
in
massachusetts
is
square
miles
and
in
connecticut
square
miles
but
in
virginia
it
is
only
and
in
kentucky
square
miles
in
south
carolina
however
where
the
county
did
not
grow
up

itself
but
has
been
enacted
so
to
speak
by
a
kind
of
afterthought
it
has
been
made

large

of

not
less

such
an
area
is
much
too
extensive
for
local
its
different
portions
are
too
far
apart
to
understand
each
other
local
wants
or
to
act
efficiently
toward
supplying
them
and
roads
bridges
and
free
schools
suffer
accordingly
an
unsuccessful
attempt
has
been
made
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
counties
but
what
seems
perhaps
more
likely
to
happen
is
the
practical
division
of
the
counties
into
school
districts
and
the
gradual
development
of
these
school
districts
into
something
like
townships

of

there
is
but
one
that
needs
to
be
mentioned
in
the
present
connection

called
not
a
parish
or
township
but
a
this
curious
designation
is
often
met
with
in
english
history
and
the
institution
which
it
describes
though
now
almost
everywhere
extinct
was
once
almost
universal
among
men
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
oldest
form
of
civil
society
which
is
still
to
be
found
among
some
barbarous
races
was
that
in
which
families
were
organized
into
clans
and
clans
into
tribes
and
we
saw
that
among
our
forefathers
in
england
the
of
the
clan
became
the
township
and
the
home
of
the
tribe
became
the
shire
or
county
now
in
nearly
all
primitive
societies
that
have
been
studied
we
find
a
group
that
is
larger
than
the
clan
but
smaller
than
the
tribe
or
in
other
words
intermediate
between
clan
and
tribe
scholars
usually
call
this
group
by
its
greek
name
or
brotherhood
for
it
was
known
long
ago
that
in
ancient
greece
clans
were
grouped
into
brotherhoods
and
brotherhoods
into
tribes
among
uncivilized
people
all
over
the
world
we
find
this
kind
of
grouping
for
example
a
tribe
of
north
american
indians
is
regularly
made
up
of
phratries
and
the
phratries
are
made
up
of
clans
and
strange
as
it
might
at
first
seem
a
good
many
features
of
early
greek
and
roman
society
have
had
much
light
thrown
upon
them
from
the
study
of
the
usages
of
cherokees
and
mohawks
wherever
men
have
been
placed
the
problem
of
forming
civil
society
has
been
in
its
main
outlines
the
same
and
in
its
earlier
stages
it
has
been
approached
in
pretty
much
the
same
way
by
all

the
hundred

the
ancient
romans
had
the
brotherhood
and
called
it
a
the
roman
people
were
organized
in
clans
curies
and
tribes
but
for
military
purposes
the
curia
was
called
a
because
it
furnished
a
quota
of
one
hundred
men
to
the
army
the
word
originally
meant
a
company
of
a
hundred
men
and
it
was
only
by
a
figure
of
speech
that
it
afterward
came
to
mean
a
period
of
a
hundred
years
now
among
all
germanic
peoples
including
the
english
the
brotherhood
seems
to
have
been
called
the
hundred
our
english
forefathers
seem
to
have
been
organized
like
other
barbarians
in
clans
brotherhoods
and
tribes
and
the
brotherhood
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
furnishing
a
hundred
warriors
to
the
host
in
the
tenth
century
we
find
england
covered
with
small
districts
known
as
hundreds
several
townships
together
made
a
hundred
and
several
hundreds
together
made
a
shire
the
hundred
was
chiefly
notable
as
the
smallest
area
for
the
administration
of
justice
the
hundred
court
was
a
representative
body
composed
of
the
lords
of
lands
or
their
stewards
with
the
reeve
and
four
selected
men
and
the
parish
priest
from
each

there
was
a

the
importance
of

diminished
the
need
for
any
such
body
intermediate
between
township
and
county
ceased
to
be
felt
and
the
functions
of
the

were
gradually
absorbed
by
the
county
almost
everywhere
in
england
by
the

of
elizabeth
the
hundred
had
fallen
into
decay
it
is
curious
that
its
name
and
some
of
its
peculiarities
should
have
been
brought
to
america
and
should
in
one
state
have
remained
to
the
present
day
some
of
the
early
settlements
in
virginia
were
called
hundreds
but
they
were
practically
nothing
more
than
parishes
and
the
name
soon
became
obsolete
except
upon
the
map
where
we
still
see
for
example
bermuda
hundred
but
in
maryland
the
hundred
flourished
and
became
the
political
unit
like
the
township
in
new
england
the
hundred
was
the
militia
district
and
the
district
for
the
assessment
of
taxes
in
the
earliest
times
it
was
also
the
representative
district
delegates
to
the
colonial
legislature
sat
for
hundreds
but
in
this
was
changed
and
representatives
were
elected
by

of
the
maryland
hundred
were
the
high
constable
the
commander
of
militia
the
the
overseer
of
roads
and
the
assessor
of
taxes
the
officer
was
elected
by
the
people
the
others
were
all
appointed
by
the
governor
the
hundred
had
also
its
assembly
of
all
the
people
which
was
in
many
respects
like
the
new
england
these
enacted
levied
taxes
appointed
committees
and
often
exhibited
a
vigorous
political
life
but
after
the
revolution
they
fell
into
disuse
and
in
the

became
extinct

organization
was

they
have
stood
with
but
little

are

used
to
choose
its
own

of
taxes
and
every
year
in
the
month
of
november
the
assessors
from
all
the
hundreds
used
to
meet
in
the
county
along
with
three
or
more
justices
of
the
peace
and
eight
grand
jurors
and
assess
the
taxes
for
the
ensuing
year
a
month
later
they
assembled
again
to
hear
complaints
from
persons
who
considered
themselves
overtaxed
and
having
disposed
of
this
business
they
proceeded
to
appoint
collectors
one
for
each
hundred
this

assembly
was

as
the
court

more

as

it
is

there
was
more

than

however
there
was
a
germ
of
organization
planted
in
these
western
townships
which
must
be
noted
as
of
great
importance
each
township
being
six
miles
in
length
and
six
miles
in
breadth
was
divided
into
numbered
sections
each
containing
just
one
square
mile
or
acres
each
section
moreover
was
divided
into
tracts
of
acres
each
and
sales
to
settlers
were
and
are
generally
made
by
tracts
at
the
rate
of
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
per
acre
for
fifty
dollars
a
man
may
buy
forty
acres
of
unsettled
land
provided
he
will
actually
go
and
settle
upon
it
and
this
has
proved
to
be
a
very
effective
inducement
for
enterprising
young
men
to
go

a
tract
thus
bought
for
fifty
dollars

turned
out

of

acres

an

wealth
difficult

the
imagination
to
grasp
sidenote
the
reservation
for
public
schools
sidenote
in
this
reservation
there
were
the
germs
of
township
government
but
in
each
of
these
townships
there
was
at
least
one
section
which
was
set
apart
for
a
special
purpose
this
was
usually
the
sixteenth
section
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
township
and
sometimes
the
section
in
the
southeast
corner
was
also
reserved
these
reservations
were
for
the
support
of
public
schools
whatever
money
was
earned
by
selling
the
land
or
otherwise
in
these
sections
was
to
be
devoted
to
school
purposes
this
was
a
most
remarkable
provision
no
other
nation
has
ever
made
a
gift
for
schools
on
so
magnificent
a
scale
we
have
good
reason
for
taking
pride
in
such
a
liberal
provision
but
we
ought
not
to
forget
that
all
national
gifts
really
involve
taxation
and
this
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
although
in
this
case
it
is
not
a
taking
of
money
but
a
keeping
of
it
back
the
national
government
says
to
the
local
government
whatever
revenues
may
come
from
that
section
of
acres
be
they
great
or
small
be
it
a
spot
in
a
rural
grazing
district
or
a
spot
in
some
crowded
city
are
not
to
go
into
the
pockets
of
individual
men
and
women
but
are
to
be
reserved
for
public
purposes
this
is
a
case
of
disguised
taxation
and
may
serve
to
remind
us
of
what
was
said
some
time
ago
that
a
government
give
anything
without
in
one
way
or
another
depriving
individuals
of
its
equivalent
no
man
can
sit
on
a
and
by
any
amount
of
tugging
at
that
lift
himself
over
a
fence
whatever
is
given
comes
from
somewhere
and
whatever
is
given
by
governments
comes
from
the
people
this
reservation
of
one
square
mile
in
every
township
for
purposes
of
education
has
already
most
profoundly
influenced
the
development
of
local
government
in
our
western
states
and
in
the
near
future
its
effects
are
likely
to
become
still
deeper
and
wider
to
mark
out
a
township
on
the
map
may
mean
very
little
but
when
once
you
create
in
that
township
some
institution
that
needs
to
be
cared
for
you
have
made
a
long
stride
toward
inaugurating
township
government
when
a
state
as
for
instance
illinois
grows
up
after
the
method
just
described
what
can
be
more
natural
than
for
it
to
make
the
township
a
body
corporate
for
school
purposes
and
to
authorize
its
inhabitants
to
elect
school
officers
and
tax
themselves
so
far
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
schools
but
the
in
the
centre
of
the
township
is
soon
found
to
be
useful
for
many
purposes
it
is
convenient
to
go
there
to
vote
for
state
officers
or
for
congressmen
and
president
and
so
the
school
township
becomes
an
election
district
having
once
established
such
a
centre
it
is
almost
inevitable
that
it
should
sooner
or
later
be
made
to
serve
sundry
other
purposes
and
become
an
area
for
the
election
of
constables
justices
of
the
peace
highway
surveyors
and
overseers
of
the
poor
in
this
way
a
vigorous
township
government
tends
to
grow
up
about
the
as
a
nucleus
somewhat
as
in
early
new
england
it
grew
up
about
the
church

this
tendency
may
be
observed
in
almost
all
the
western
states
and
territories
even
to
the
pacific
coast
when
the
western
country
was
first
settled
representative
county
government
prevailed
almost
everywhere
this
was
partly
because
the
earliest
settlers
of
the
west
came
in
much
greater
numbers
from
the
middle
and
southern
states
than
from
new
england
it
was
also
partly
because
so
long
as
the
country
was
thinly
settled
the
number
of
people
in
a
township
was
very
small
and
it
was
not
easy
to
have
a
government
smaller
than
that
of
the
county
it
was
something
however
that
the
little
squares
on
the
map
by
grouping
which
the
counties
were
made
were
already
called
townships
there
is
much
in
a
name
it
was
still
more
important
that
these
townships
were
only
six
miles
square
for
that
made
it
sure
that
in

of

when

should
have
become

would

the

administrative

are
more

less
concentrated

the

is
quite
subordinate

county
the
principal
features
of
this
system
have
been
reproduced
in

the
other
system
was
that
which
we
have
seen
beginning
in

under
the
influence
of

york
and
new

here
the
with

is
always

the
most
noticeable
feature
of
the
michigan
system
is
the
relation
between
township
and
county
which
was
taken
from
new
york
the
county
board
is
composed
of
the
supervisors
of
the
several
townships
and
thus
represents
the
townships
it
is
the
same
in
illinois
it
is
held
by
some
writers
that
this
is
the
most
perfect
form
of
local
government
but
on
the
other
hand
the
objection
is
made
that
county
boards
thus
constituted
are
too
large
we
have
seen
that
in
the
states
in
question
there
are
not
less
than
and
sometimes
more
than
townships
in
each
county
in
a
board
of
or
members
it
is
hard
to
fasten
responsibility
upon
anybody
in
particular
and
thus
it
becomes
possible
to
have
combinations
and
to
indulge
in
that
exchange
of
favours
known
as

is
one
of
the
besetting
sins
of

the
historical
reason
why
the

has
so
generally
been
restricted
to

is
perhaps
to
be
sought
in
the
conditions
under
which
voting
originated
in
primeval
times
voting
was
probably
adopted
as
a
substitute
for

the

the
restriction
of
political
activity
to

has
also
probably
been
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
all
the

have
passed
through
a
patriarchal
stage

society

was

in

survey
of

we
have
had
occasion
to
compare
and
sometimes
to
contrast
two
different
methods
of
government
as
exemplified
on
the
one
hand
in
the
township
and
on
the
other
hand
in
the
county
in
the
former
we
have
direct
government
by
a
primary
assembly
the
in
the
latter
we
have
indirect
government
by
a
representative
board
if
the
county
board
as
in
colonial
virginia
perpetuates
itself
or
is
appointed
otherwise
than
by
popular
vote
it
is
not
strictly
a
representative
board
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
phrase
the
government
is
a
kind
of
oligarchy
if
as
in
colonial
pennsylvania
and
in
the
united
states
generally
the
county
board
consists
of
officers
elected
by
the
people
the
county
government
is
a
representative
democracy
the
township
government
on
the
other
hand
as
exemplified
in
new
england
and
in
the
northwestern
states
which
have
adopted
it
is
a
pure
democracy
the
latter
as
we
have
observed
has
one
signal
advantage
over
all
other
kinds
of
government
in
so
far
as
it
tends
to
make
every
man
feel
that
the
business
of
government
is
part
of
his
own
business
and
that
where
he
has
a
stake
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
he
has
also
a
voice
when
people
have
got
into
the
habit
of
leaving
local
affairs
to
be
managed
by
representative
boards
their
active
interest
in
local
affairs
is
liable
to
be
somewhat
weakened
as
all
energies
in
this
world
are
weakened
from
want
of
exercise
when
some
fit
subject
of
complaint
is
brought
up
the
individual
is
too
apt
to
feel
that
it
is
none
of
his
business
to
furnish
a
remedy
let
the
proper
officers
look
after
it
he
can
vote
at
elections
which
is
a
power
he
can
perhaps
make
a
stir
in
the
newspapers
which
is
also
a
power
but
personal
participation
in
is
likewise
a
power
the
necessary
loss
of
which
as
we
pass
to
wider
spheres
of
government
is
unquestionably
to
be
regretted

the

inheritance
from

ancient
english
shire

furnished
the
needful
machinery
our
county

is
near
enough
to
the
people
to
be
kept
in
general
from
gross
abuses
of
power
there
are
many
points
which
can
be
much
better
decided
in
small
representative
bodies
than
in
large
miscellaneous
meetings
the
responsibility
of
our
local
boards
has
been
fairly
well
preserved
the
county
system
has
had
no
mean
share
in
keeping
alive
the
spirit
of
local
independence
and
among
our
people
as
regards
efficiency
of
administration
it
has
achieved
commendable
success
except
in
the
matter
of
rural
highways

if
our
roads
are
worse
than
those
of
any
other
civilized
country
that
is
due
not
so
much
to
imperfect
administrative
methods
as
to
other
causes

as
the
sparseness
of
population
the
fierce
extremes
of
sunshine

the
fact
that
since

huge
country
began
to
be
reclaimed

under

circumstances
it
was

for
boston
after
various
plans
had
been
suggested

that
the

between

there
is
more
or
less
of

involved
in
these
offices
and
designations
to
which
we
may
devote
a
few
words
of
explanation
in
new
england
local
usage
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
word
town
as
an
official
designation
it
means
the
inhabitants
of
a
township
considered
as
a
community
or
corporate
body
in
common
parlance
it
often
means
the
patch
of
land
constituting
the
township
on
the
map
as
when
we
say
that
squire
brown
elm
is
the
biggest
tree
in
town
but
it
still
oftener
means
a
collection
of
streets
houses
and
families
too
large
to
be
called
a
village
but
without
the
municipal
government
that
characterizes
a
city
sometimes
it
is
used
for
a
city
as
when
an
inhabitant
of
cambridge
itself
a
large
suburban
city
speaks
of
going
to
boston
as
going
into
town
but
such
cases
are
of
course
mere
survivals
from
the
time
when
the
suburb
was
a
village
in
american
usage
generally
the
town
is
something
between
village
and
city
a
kind
of
inferior
or
incomplete
city
the
image
which
it
calls
up
in
the
mind
is
of
something
urban
and
not
rural
this
agrees
substantially
with
the
usage
in
european
history
where
town
ordinarily
means
a
walled
town
or
city
as
contrasted
with
a
village
in
england
the
word
is
used
either
in
this
general
sense
or
more
specifically
as
signifying
an
inferior
city
as
in
america
but
the
thing
which
the
town
lacks
as
compared
with
the
complete
city
is
very
different
in
america
from
what
it
is
in
england
in
america
it
is
municipal
government
with
mayor
aldermen
and
common
council
which
must
be
added
to
the
town
in
order
to
make
it
a
city
in
england
the
town
may
and
usually
does
have
this
municipal
government
but
it
is
not
distinguished
by
the
latin
name
city
unless
it
has
a
cathedral
and
a
bishop
or
in
other
words
the
english
city
is
or
has
been
the
capital
of
a
diocese
other
towns
in
england
are
distinguished
as
boroughs
an
old
teutonic
word
which
was
originally
applied
to
towns
as
places
the
voting
inhabitants
of
an
english
city
are
called
citizens
those
of
a
borough
are
called
burgesses
thus
the
official
corporate
designation
of
cambridge
is
the
mayor
aldermen
and
of
cambridge
but
oxford
is
the
seat
of
a
bishopric
and
its
corporate
designation
is
the
mayor
aldermen
and
of
oxford

as
scarborough
canterbury
bury
and
on
the
continent
as

connecticut
new

the

is
applied
to
a

was
the

in
the
days
when
roman
legions
occupied
for
a
long
time
certain
military
stations
in
britain
their
camps
were
apt
to
become
centres
of
trade
and
thus
to
grow
into
cities
such
places
were
generally
known
as
or
from
the
latin
camp
and
there
are
many
of
them
on
the
map
of
england
but
these
were
exceptional
cases
as
a
rule
the
origin
of
the
borough
was
as
purely
english
as
its
name
we
have
seen
that
the
town
was
originally
the
of
a
stationary
clan
surrounded
by
palisades
or
by
a
dense
quickset
hedge
now
where
such
small
enclosed
places
were
thinly
scattered
about
they
developed
simply
into
villages
but
where
through
the
development
of
trade
or
any
other
cause
a
good
many
of
them
grew
up
close
together
within
a
narrow
compass
they
gradually
coalesced
into
a
kind
of
compound
town
and
with
the
greater
population
and
greater
wealth
there
was
naturally
more
elaborate
and
permanent
fortification
than
that
of
the
palisaded
village
there
were
massive
walls
and
frowning
turrets
and
the
place
came
to
be
called
a
fortress
or
borough
the
borough
then
was
simply
several
townships
packed
tightly
together
a
hundred

and

the
borough
as
a

from
this
compact
and
composite
character
of
the
borough
came
several
important
results
we
have
seen
that
the
hundred
was
the
smallest
area
for
the
administration
of
justice
the
township
was
in
many
respects
but
it
did
not
have
its
court
any
more
than
the
new
england
township
of
the
present
day
has
its
court
the
lowest
court
was
that
of
the
hundred
but
as
the
borough
was
equivalent
to
a
hundred
it
soon
came
to
have
its
own
court
and
although
much
obscurity
still
surrounds
the
early
history
of
municipal
government
in
england
it
is
probable
that
this
court
was
a
representative
board
like
any
other
hundred
court
and
that
the
relation
of
the
borough
to
its
constituent
townships
resembled
the
relation
of
the
modern
city
to
its
constituent
wards
sidenote
the
borough
as
a
county
but
now
as
certain
boroughs
grew
larger
and
annexed
outlying
townships
or
acquired
adjacent
territory
which
presently
became
covered
with
streets
and
houses
their
constitution
became
still
more
complex
the
borough
came
to
embrace
several
closely
packed
hundreds
and
thus
became
analogous
to
a
shire
in
this
way
it
gained
for
itself
a
sheriff
and
the
equivalent
of
a
county
court
for
example
under
the
charter
granted
by
henry
in
london
was
expressly
recognized
as
a
county
by
itself
its
burgesses
could
elect
their
own
chief
magistrate
who
was
called
the
inasmuch
as
london
is
a
seaport
in
some
other
towns
he
was
called
the
he
was
at
once
the
chief
executive
officer
and
the
chief
judge
the
burgesses
could
also
elect
their
sheriff
although
in
all
rural
counties
father
william
the
conqueror
had
lately
deprived
the
people
of
this
privilege
and
appointed
the
sheriffs
himself
london
had
its
representative
board
or
council
which
was
the
equivalent
of
a
county
court
each
ward
moreover
had
its
own
representative
board
which
was
the
equivalent
of
a
hundred
court
within
the
wards
or
hundreds
the
burgesses
were
grouped
together
in
township
parish
or
manor
into
the
civic
organization
of
london
to
whose
special
privileges
all
lesser
cities
were
ever
striving
to
attain
the
elements
of
local
administration
embodied
in
the
township
the
hundred
and
the
shire
thus
entered
as
component
parts
constitutionally
therefore
london
was
a
little
world
in
itself
and
in
a
less
degree
the
same
was
true
of
other
cities
and
boroughs
which
afterwards
obtained
the
same
kind
of
organization
as

common
in
england
in
both
the
mayor
the
recorder
the
aldermen
and
the
common
council
constituted
a
close
corporation
the
resulting
abuses
were
not
so
great
as
in
england
probably
because
the
cities
were
so
small
but
in
course
of
time
especially
in
philadelphia
as
it
increased
in
population
the
viciousness
of
the
system
was
abundantly
illustrated
as
the
people
could
not
elect
the
governing
corporation
or
any
of
its
members
they
very
naturally
and
reasonably
distrusted
it
and
through
the
legislature
they
contrived
so
to
limit
its
powers
of
taxation
that
it
was
really
unable
to
keep
the
streets
in
repair
to
light
them
at
night
or
to
support
an
adequate
police
force
an
attempt
was
made
to
supply
such
wants
by
creating
divers
independent
boards
of
commissioners
one
for
paving
and
draining
another
for
and
watchmen
a
third
for
and
so
on
in
this
way
responsibility
got
so
minutely
parcelled
out
and
scattered
and
there
was
so
much
jealousy
and
wrangling
between
the
different
boards
and
the
corporation
that
the
result
was
chaos
the
public
money
was
habitually
wasted
and
occasionally
embezzled
and
there
was
general
dissatisfaction
in
the
close
corporation
was
abolished
and
thereafter
the
aldermen
and
common
council
were
elected
by
the
citizens
the
mayor
was
chosen
by
the
aldermen
out
of
their
own
number
and
the
recorder
was
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
aldermen
thus
philadelphia
obtained
a
representative
government
sidenote
traditions
of
good
government
lacking
these
instances
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
sufficiently
illustrate
the
beginnings
of
city
government
in
the
united
states
in
each
case
the
system
was
copied
from
england
at
a
time
when
city
government
in
england
was
sadly
demoralized
what
was
copied
was
not
the
free
republic
of
london
with
its
noble
traditions
of
civic
honour
and
sagacious
public
spirit
but
the
imperfect
republics
or
oligarchies
into
which
the
lesser
english
boroughs
were
sinking
amid
the
foul
political
intrigues
and
corruption
which
characterized
the
stuart
period
the
government
of
american
cities
in
our
own
time
is
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
far
from
satisfactory
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
cities
which
had
municipal
government
before
the
revolution
though
they
have
always
had
their
full
share
of
able
and
citizens
do
not
possess
even
the
tradition
of
good
government
and
the
difficulty
in
those
colonial
times
was
plainly
want
of
adequate
want
of
responsibility

the
part
of
the

section

government
of
cities
in

united
states
sidenote
several
features
of
our
city
governments
at
the
present
day
american
municipal
governments
are
for
the
most
part
constructed
on
the
same
general
plan
though
with
many
variations
in
detail
there
is
an
executive
department
with
the
mayor
at
its
head
the
mayor
is
elected
voters
of
the
city
and
holds
office
generally
for
one
year
but
sometimes
for
two
or
three
years
and
in
louis
and
philadelphia
even
for
four
years
under
the
mayor
are
various
heads
of
departments
street
commissioners
assessors
overseers
of
the
poor
sometimes
elected
by
the
citizens
sometimes
appointed
by
the
mayor
or
the
city
council
this
city
council
is
a
legislative
body
usually
consisting
of
two
chambers
the
aldermen
and
the
common
council
elected
by
the
citizens
but
in
many
small
cities
and
a
few
of
the
largest
such
as
new
york
brooklyn
chicago
and
san
francisco
there
is
but
one
such
chamber
then
there
are
city
judges
sometimes
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state
to
serve
for
life
or
during
good
behaviour
but
usually
elected
by
the
citizens
for
short
terms
all
appropriations
of
money
for
city
purposes
are
made
by
the
city
council
and
as
a
general
rule
this
council
has
some
control
over
the
heads
of
executive
departments
which
it
exercises
through
committees
thus
there
may
be
a
committee
upon
streets
upon
public
buildings
upon
parks
or
almshouses
or
whatever
the
municipal
government
is
concerned
with
the
head
of
a
department
is
more
or
less
dependent
upon
his
committee
and
in
practice
this
is
found
to
divide
and
weaken
responsibility
the
heads
of
departments
are
apt
to
be
independent
of
one
another
and
to
owe
no
allegiance
in
common
to
any
one
the
mayor
when
he
appoints
them
usually
does
so
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
city
council
or
of
one
branch
of
it
the
mayor
is
usually
not
a
member
of
the
city
council
but
can
veto
its
enactments
which
however
can
be
passed
over
his
veto
by
a
two
thirds
majority
sidenote
they
do
not
seem
to
work
well
sidenote
some
difficulties
to
be
stated
city
governments
thus
constituted
are
something
like
state
governments
in
miniature
the
relation
of
the
mayor
to
the
city
council
is
somewhat
like
that
of
the
governor
to
the
state
legislature
and
of
the
president
to
the
national
congress
in
theory
nothing
could
well
be
more
republican
or
more
unlike
such
city
governments
as
those
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
before
the
revolution
yet
in
practice
it
does
not
seem
to
work
well
new
york
and
philadelphia
seem
to
have
heard
as
many
complaints
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
in
the
eighteenth
and
the
same
kind
of
complaints
of
excessive
taxation
public
money
wasted
or
embezzled
and
dirty
streets
inefficient
police
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
in
most
of
our
large
cities
similar
evils
have
been
witnessed
and
in
too
many
of
the
smaller
ones
the
trouble
seems
to
be
the
same
in
kind
only
less
in
degree
our
republican
government
which
after
making
all
due
allowances
seems
to
work
remarkably
well
in
rural
districts
and
in
the
states
and
in
the
nation
has
certainly
been
far
less
successful
as
applied
to
cities
accordingly
our
cities
have
come
to
furnish
topics
for
reflection
to
which
writers
and
orators
fond
of
boasting
the
unapproachable
excellence
of
american
institutions
do
not
like
to
allude
fifty
years
ago
we
were
wont
to
speak
of
civil
government
in
the
united
states
as
if
it
had
dropped
from
heaven
or
had
been
specially
created
by
some
kind
of
miracle
upon
american
soil
and
we
were
apt
to
think
that
in
mere
republican
forms
there
was
some
kind
of
mystic
virtue
which
made
them
a
panacea
for
all
political
evils
our
later
experience
with
cities
has
rudely
disturbed
this
too
confident
frame
of
mind
it
has
furnished
facts
which
do
not
seem
to
fit
our
theory
so
that
now
our
writers
and
speakers
are
inclined
to
vent
their
spleen
upon
the
unhappy
cities
perhaps
too
unreservedly
we
hear
them
called
foul
sinks
of
corruption
and
plague
spots
on
our
body
politic
yet
in
all
probability
our
cities
are
destined
to
increase
in
number
and
to
grow
larger
and
larger
so
that
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
to
consider
them
calmly
as
presenting
problems
which
had
not
been
thought
of
when
our
general
theory
of
government
was
first
worked
out
a
hundred
years
ago
but
which
after
we
have
been
sufficiently
taught
by
experience
we
may
hope
to
succeed
in
solving
just
as
we
have
heretofore
succeeded
in
other
things
a
general
discussion
of
the
subject
does
not
fall
within
the
province
of
this
brief
historical
sketch
but
our
account
would
be
very
incomplete
if
we
were
to
stop
short
of
mentioning
some
of
the
recent
attempts
that
have
been
made
toward
reconstructing
our
theories
of
city
government
and
improving
its
practical
working
and
first
let
us
point
out
a
few
of
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
the
problem
that
we
may
see
why
we
might
have
been
expected
up
to
the
present
time
to
have
been
less
successful
in
managing
our
great
cities
than
in
managing
our
rural
communities
and
our
states
and
our
nation
sidenote
rapid
growth
of
american
cities
in
the
first
place
the
problem
is
comparatively
new
and
has
taken
us
unawares
at
the
time
of
washington
inauguration
to
the
presidency
there
were
no
large
cities
in
the
united
states
philadelphia
had
a
population
of
new
york
had
boston
which
came
next
with
was
not
yet
a
city
then
came
baltimore
with
while
brooklyn
was
a
village
of
souls
now
these
five
cities
have
a
population
of
more
than
or
more
than
that
of
the
united
states
in
and
consider
how
rapidly
new
cities
have
been
added
to
the
list
one
hardly
needs
to
mention
the
most
striking
cases
such
as
chicago
with
inhabitants
in
and
at
least
in
or
denver
with
its
miles
of
handsome
streets
and
shops
and
not
one
native
inhabitant
who
has
reached
his
thirtieth
birthday
such
facts
are
summed
up
in
the
general
statement
that
whereas
in
the
population
of
the
united
states
was
scarcely
and
out
of
each
inhabitants
only
dwelt
in
cities
and
the
other
in
rural
places
on
the
other
hand
in
when
the
population
was
more
than
out
of
each
inhabitants
dwelt
in
cities
and
in
rural
places
but
duly
to
appreciate
the
rapidity
of
this
growth
of
cities
we
must
observe
that
most
of
it
has
been
subsequent
to
in
there
were
six
towns
in
the
united
states
that
might
be
ranked
as
cities
from
their
size
though
to
get
this
number
we
must
include
boston
in
the
number
was
the
same
by
the
number
had
risen
from
to
by
it
had
reached
by
this
thirteen
had
doubled
and
become
and
in
there
were
cities
altogether
the
urban
population
increased
from
in
to
in
but
between
and
the
number
of
new
cities
which
came
into
existence
was
and
the
urban
population
increased
to
nothing
like
this
was
ever
known
before
in
any
part
of
the
world
and
perhaps
it
is
not
strange
that
such
a
tremendous
development
did
not
find
our
methods
of
government
fully
prepared
to
deal
with
it
sidenote
want
of
practical
foresight
this
rapidity
of
growth
has
entailed
some
important
consequences
in
the
first
place
it
obliges
the
city
to
make
great
outlays
of
money
in
order
to
get
immediate
results
public
works
must
be
undertaken
with
a
view
to
quickness
rather
than
thoroughness
pavements
sewers
and
reservoirs
of
some
sort
must
be
had
at
once
even
if
inadequately
planned
and
imperfectly
constructed
and
so
before
a
great
while
the
work
must
be
done
over
again
such
conditions
of
imperative
haste
increase
the
temptations
to
dishonesty
as
well
as
the
liability
to
errors
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
men
who
administer
the
public
funds
then
the
rapid
growth
of
a
city
especially
of
a
new
city
requiring
the
immediate
construction
of
a
certain
amount
of
public
works
almost
necessitates
the
borrowing
of
money
and
debt
means
heavy
taxes
it
is
like
the
case
of
a
young
man
who
in
order
to
secure
a
home
for
his
quickly
growing
family
buys
a
house
under
a
heavy
mortgage
twice
a
year
there
comes
in
a
great
bill
for
interest
and
in
order
to
meet
it
he
must
economize
in
his
table
or
now
and
then
deny
himself
a
new
suit
of
clothes
so
if
a
city
has
to
tax
heavily
to
pay
its
debts
it
must
cut
down
its
current
expenses
somewhere
and
the
results
are
sure
to
be
visible
in
more
or
less
untidiness
and
inefficiency
low
tells
us
that
very
few
of
our
american
cities
have
yet
paid
in
full
the
cost
of
their
original
lastly
much
wastefulness
results
from
want
of
foresight
it
is
not
easy
to
predict
how
a
city
will
grow
or
the
nature
of
its
needs
a
few
years
hence
moreover
even
when
it
is
easy
enough
to
predict
a
result
it
is
not
easy
to
secure
practical
foresight
on
the
part
of
a
city
council
elected
for
the
current
year
its
members
are
afraid
of
making
taxes
too
heavy
this
year
and
considerations
of
ten
years
hence
are
apt
to
be
dismissed
as
visionary
it
is
always
hard
for
us
to
realize
how
terribly
soon
ten
years
hence
will
be
here
the
habit
of
doing
things
by
halves
has
been
often
commented
on
and
perhaps
even
more
by
our
own
writers
than
by
foreigners
as
especially
noticeable
in
america
it
has
doubtless
been
fostered
by
the
conditions
which
in
so
many
cases
have
made
it
absolutely
necessary
to
adopt
temporary
makeshifts
these
conditions
have
produced
a
certain
habit
of
mind
footnote
this
and
some
of
the
following
considerations
have
been
ably
set
forth
and
illustrated
by
hon
seth
low
president
of
columbia
college
and
lately
mayor
of
brooklyn
in
an
address
at
johns
hopkins
university
published
in
u
studies
supplementary
no
sidenote
growth
in
complexity
of
government
in
cities
let
us
now
observe
that
as
cities
increase
in
size
the
amount
of
government
that
is
necessary
tends
in
some
respects
to
increase
wherever
there
is
a
crowd
there
is
likely
to
be
some
need
of
rules
and
regulations
in
the
country
a
man
may
build
his
house
pretty
much
as
he
pleases
but
in
the
city
he
may
be
forbidden
to
build
it
of
wood
and
perhaps
even
the
thickness
of
the
party
walls
or
the
position
of
the
chimneys
may
come
in
for
some
supervision
on
the
part
of
the
government
for
further
precaution
against
spreading
fires
the
city
has
an
organized
force
of
men
with
costly
engines
and
stables
in
the
country
a
board
of
health
has
comparatively
little
to
do
in
the
city
it
is
often
confronted
with
difficult
sanitary
problems
which
call
for
highly
paid
professional
skill
on
the
part
of
physicians
and
chemists
architects
and
plumbers
masons
and
engineers
so
too
the
water
supply
of
a
great
city
is
likely
to
be
a
complicated
business
and
the
police
force
may
well
need
as
much
management
as
a
small
army
in
short
with
a
city
increase
in
size
is
sure
to
involve
increase
in
complexity
of
organization
and
this
means
a
vast
increase
in
the
number
of
officials
for
doing
the
work
and
of
details
to
be
superintended
for
example
let
us
enumerate
the
executive
department
and
officers
of
the
city
of
boston
at
the
present
time
sidenote
municipal
officers
in
boston
there
are
three
street
commissioners
with
power
to
lay
out
streets
and
assess
damages
thereby
occasioned
these
are
elected
by
the
people
the
following
officers
are
appointed
by

sidenote
how
city
government
comes
to
be
a
mystery
this
long
list
may
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
mere
quantity
of
administrative
work
required
in
a
large
city
obviously
under
such
circumstances
city
government
must
become
more
or
less
of
a
mystery
to
the
great
mass
of
citizens
they
can
not
watch
its
operations
as
the
inhabitants
of
a
small
village
can
watch
the
proceedings
of
their
township
and
county
governments
much
work
must
go
on
which
can
not
even
be
intelligently
criticised
without
such
special
knowledge
as
it
would
be
idle
to
expect
in
the
average
voter
or
perhaps
in
any
voter
it
becomes
exceedingly
difficult
for
the
taxpayer
to
understand
just
what
his
money
goes
for
or
how
far
the
city
expenses
might
reasonably
be
reduced
and
it
becomes
correspondingly
easy
for
municipal
corruption
to
start
and
acquire
a
considerable
headway
before
it
can
be
detected
and
checked
sidenote
in
some
respects
it
is
more
of
a
mystery
that
state
and
national
government
in
some
respects
city
government
is
harder
to
watch
intelligently
than
the
government
of
the
state
or
of
the
nation
for
these
wider
governments
are
to
some
extent
limited
to
work
of
general
supervision
as
compared
with
the
city
they
are
more
concerned
with
the
establishment
and
enforcement
of
certain
general
principles
and
less
with
the
administration
of
endlessly
complicated
details
i
do
not
mean
to
be
understood
as
saying
that
there
is
not
plenty
of
intricate
detail
about
state
and
national
governments
i
am
only
comparing
one
thing
with
another
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
chief
difficulty
with
city
government
is
the
bewildering
vastness
and
multifariousness
of
the
details
with
which
it
is
concerned
the
modern
city
has
come
to
be
a
huge
corporation
for
carrying
on
a
huge
business
with
many
branches
most
of
which
call
for
special
aptitude
and
training
sidenote
the
mayor
at
first
had
too
little
power
as
these
points
have
gradually
forced
themselves
upon
public
attention
there
has
been
a
tendency
in
many
of
our
large
cities
toward
remodeling
their
governments
on
new
principles
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
this
tendency
is
the
increase
in
the
powers
of
the
mayor
a
hundred
years
ago
our
legislators
and
were
much
afraid
of
what
was
called
the
power
in
nearly
all
the
colonies
a
chronic
quarrel
had
been
kept
up
between
the
governors
appointed
by
the
king
and
the
legislators
elected
by
the
people
and
this
had
made
the
power
very
unpopular
besides
it
was
something
that
had
been
unpopular
in
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
it
was
thought
to
be
essentially
unrepublican
in
principle
accordingly
our
great
grandfathers
preferred
to
entrust
executive
powers
to
committees
rather
than
to
single
individuals
and
when
they
assigned
an
important
office
to
an
individual
they
usually
took
pains
to
curtail
its
power
and
influence
this
disposition
was
visible
in
our
early
attempts
to
organize
city
governments
like
little
republics
first
in
the
board
of
aldermen
and
the
common
council
we
had
a
legislature
then
lest
the
mayor
should
become
dangerous
the
veto
power
was
at
first
generally
withheld
from
him
and
his
appointments
of
executive
officers
needed
to
be
confirmed
by
at
least
one
branch
of
the
city
council
these
executive
officers
moreover
as
already
observed
were
subject
to
more
or
less
control
or
oversight
from
committees
of
the
city
council
sidenote
scattering
and
weakening
of
responsibility
now
this
system
in
depriving
the
mayor
of
power
deprived
him
of
responsibility
and
left
the
responsibility
nowhere
in
particular
in
making
appointments
the
mayor
and
council
would
come
to
some
sort
of
compromise
with
each
other
and
exchange
favours
perhaps
for
private
reasons
incompetent
or
dishonest
officers
would
get
appointed
and
if
the
citizens
ventured
to
complain
the
mayor
would
say
that
he
appointed
as
good
men
as
the
council
could
be
induced
to
confirm
and
the
council
would
declare
their
willingness
to
confirm
good
appointments
if
the
mayor
could
only
be
persuaded
to
make
them
sidenote
committees
inefficient
for
executive
purposes
then
the
want
of
subordination
of
the
different
executive
departments
made
it
impossible
to
secure
unity
of
administration
or
to
carry
out
any
consistent
and
generally
intelligible
policy
between
the
various
executive
officers
and
visiting
committees
there
was
apt
to
be
a
more
or
less
extensive
interchange
of
favours
or
what
is
called
and
sums
of
money
would
be
voted
by
the
council
only
thus
to
leak
away
in
undertakings
the
propriety
or
necessity
of
which
was
perhaps
hard
to
determine
there
was
no
responsible
head
who
could
be
quickly
and
sharply
called
to
account
each
official
hands
were
so
tied
that
whatever
went
wrong
he
could
declare
that
it
was
not
his
fault
the
confusion
was
enhanced
by
the
practice
of
giving
executive
work
to
committees
or
boards
instead
of
single
officers
benjamin
franklin
used
to
say
if
you
wish
to
be
sure
that
a
thing
is
done
go
and
do
it
yourself
human
experience
certainly
proves
that
this
is
the
only
absolutely
safe
way
the
next
best
way
is
to
send
some
competent
person
to
do
it
for
you
and
if
there
is
no
one
competent
to
be
had
you
do
the
next
best
thing
and
entrust
the
work
to
the
least
incompetent
person
you
can
find
if
you
entrust
it
to
a
committee
your
prospect
of
getting
it
done
is
diminished
and
it
grows
less

you
enlarge
your
committee

people
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
rapid
and
alarming
increase
of
city
indebtedness
in
various
parts
of
the
country
a
heavy
debt
may
ruin
a
city
as
surely
as
an
individual
for
it
raises
the
rate
of
taxation
and
thus
as
was
above
pointed
out
it
tends
to
frighten
people
and
capital
away
from
the
city
at
first
it
was
sought
to
curb
the
recklessness
of
city
councils
in
incurring
lavish
expenditures
by
giving
the
mayor
a
veto
power
laws
were
also
passed
limiting
the
amount
of
debt
which
a
city
would
be
allowed
to
incur
under
any
circumstances
clothing
the
mayor
with
the
veto
power
is
now
seen
to
have
been
a
wise
step
and
arbitrary
limitation
of
the
amount
of
debt
though
a
clumsy
expedient
is
confessedly
a
necessary
one
but
beyond
this
it
was
in
some
instances
attempted
to
take
the
management
of
some
departments
of
city
business
out
of
the
hands
of
the
city
and
put
them
into
the
hands
of
the
state
legislature
the
most
notable
instance
of
this
was
in
new
york
in
the
results
there
and
elsewhere
have
been
generally
regarded
as
unsatisfactory
after
a
trial
of
thirty
years
the
experience
of
new
york
has
proved
that
a
state
legislature
is
not
competent
to
take
proper
care
of
the
government
of
cities
its
members
do
not
know
enough
about
the
details
of
each
locality
and
consequently
local
affairs
are
left
to
the
representatives
from
each
locality
with
as
the
inevitable
result
a
man
fresh
from
his
farm
on
the
edge
of
the
adirondacks
knows
nothing
about
the
problems
pertaining
to
electric
wires
in
broadway
or
to
rapid
transit
between
harlem
and
the
battery
and
his
consent
to
desired
legislation
on
such
points
can
very
likely
be
obtained
only
by
favouring
some
measure
which
he
thinks
will
improve
the
value
of
his
farm
or
perhaps
by
helping
him
to
debauch
the
civil
service
by
getting
some
neighbour
appointed
to
a
position
for
which
he
is
not
qualified
all
this
is
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
the
members
of
a
state
government
are
generally
less
governed
by
a
sense
of
responsibility
toward
the
citizens
of
a
particular
city
than
even
the
worst
local
government
that
can
be
set
up
in
such
a
city
footnote
it
is
not
intended
to
deny
that
there
may
be
instances
in
which
the
state
government
may
advantageously
participate
in
the
government
of
cities
it
may
be
urged
that
in
the
case
of
great
cities
like
new
york
or
boston
many
people
who
are
not
residents
either
do
business
in
the
city
or
have
vast
business
interests
there
and
thus
may
be
as
deeply
interested
in
its
welfare
as
any
of
the
voters
it
may
also
be
said
that
state
provisions
for
city
government
do
not
always
work
badly
there
are
many
competent
judges
who
approve
of
the
appointment
of
police
commissioners
by
the
executive
of
massachusetts
there
are
generally
two
sides
to
a
question
and
to
push
a
doctrine
to
extremes
is
to
make
oneself
a
rather
than
a
wise
citizen
but
experience
clearly
shows
that
in
all
doubtful
cases
it
is
safer
to
let
the
balance
incline
in
favour
of
local
than
the
other
way
moreover
even
if
legislatures
were
otherwise
competent
to
manage
the
local
affairs
of
cities
they
have
not
time
enough
amid
the
pressure
of
other
duties
to
do
justice
to
such
matters
in
the
number
of
acts
passed
by
the
new
york
legislature
was
of
these
or
more
than
one
fourth
of
the
whole
related
to
cities
and
villages
the
acts
when
printed
filled
about
octavo
pages
and
of
these
the
acts
filled
more
than
pages
this
illustrates
what
i
said
above
about
the
vast
quantity
of
details
which
have
to
be
regulated
in
municipal
government
here
we
have
more
than
three
fourths
of
the
volume
of
devoted
to
local
affairs
and
it
hardly
need
be
added
that
a
great
part
of
these
enactments
were
worse
than
worthless
because
they
were
made
hastily
and
without
due
consideration
though
not
always
perhaps
without
what
lawyers
call
consideration
footnote
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
thought
than
to
cast
any
special
imputation
upon
the
new
york
legislature
which
is
probably
a
fair
average
specimen
of
bodies
the
theory
of
legislative
bodies
as
laid
down
in
is
that
they
are
assembled
for
the
purpose
of
enacting
laws
for
the
welfare
of
the
community
in
general
in
point
of
fact
they
seldom
rise
to
such
a
lofty
height
of
disinterestedness
legislation
is
usually
a
mad
scramble
in
which
the
final
result
be
it
good
or
bad
gets
evolved
out
of
compromises
and
bargains
among
a
swarm
of
clashing
local
and
personal
interests
the
consideration
may
be
anything
from
to

it
is
to
be

a

and
to
many
attempts
at

reform
the
present
is
especially
a
period
of
experiments
yet
in
these
experiments
perhaps
a
general
drift
of
opinion
may
be
discerned
people
seem
to
be
coming
to
regard
cities
more
as
if
they
were
huge
business
corporations
than
as
if
they
were
little
republics
the
lesson
has
been
learned
that
in
executive
matters
too
much
limitation
of
power
entails
destruction
of
responsibility
the
ring
is
now
more
dreaded
than
the
power
and
there
is
accordingly
a
manifest
tendency
to
assail
the
evil
by
concentrating
power
and
responsibility
in
the
mayor
sidenote
new
government
of
brooklyn
the
first
great
city
to
adopt
this
method
was
brooklyn
in
the
first
place
the
city
council
was
simplified
and
made
a
council
consisting
of
nineteen
aldermen
besides
this
council
of
aldermen
the
people
elect
only
three
city
officers
the

comptroller
and

the
comptroller
is
the

officer
and
of
the
city
and
the
auditor
must
approve
bills
against
the
city
whether
great
or
small
before
they
can
be
paid
the
mayor
appoints
without
confirmation
by
the
council
all
executive
heads
of
departments
and
these
executive
heads
are
individuals
not
boards
thus
there
is
a
single
police
commissioner
a
single
fire
commissioner
a
single
health
commissioner
and
so
on
and
each
of
these
heads
appoints
his
own
subordinates
so
that
the
principle
of
defined
responsibility
permeates
the
city
government
from
top
to
bottom
in
a
few
cases
where
the
work
to
be
done
is
rather
discretionary
than
executive
in
character
it
is
intrusted
to
a
board
thus
there
is
a
board
of

a

of

and
a
board
of

these
are
all
appointed
by
the

but
for
terms
not

with
his

so
that
in

cases
no

would
appoint

of
any

unless
he
were
to
be

but

extraordinary
pains
are
taken
to
secure
good
mayors
and
the
increased
interest
in
city

is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
brooklyn
more
people
vote
for
mayor
than
for
governor
or
for
president
fifty
years

such
a
reduction
in
the
number
of

would
have
greatly
shocked
all

in
point
of
fact
while
in
small
townships
where
everybody
knows
everybody
popular
control
is
best
ensured
by
electing
all
public
officers
it
is
very
different
in
great
cities
where
it
is
impossible
that
the
voters
in
general
should
know
much
about
the
qualifications
of
a
long
list
of

are

to
vote

that
they
occur

if
the

is
simply
to
secure
an
upright

efficient
municipal

to
elect
a

has
a
taste
for
chrysanthemums
to
vote
for
candidates
whom
one
has
never
heard
of
is
not
to
insure
popular
control
but
to
endanger
it
it
is
much
better
to
vote
for
one
man
whose
reputation
we
know
and
then
to
hold
him
strictly
responsible
for
the
appointments
he
makes

to
be

from
the
point

view
of
the

it
is
quite

has
its
elaborate
machine
for
electing
state

national
officers

in

to
be
kept
at
its
maximum
of
efficiency
the
machine
must
be

such
occasions
are
properly
concerned

whether
a
city
magistrate
is
a
republican
or
a
democrat
to
him
even
the
political
complexion
of
his
is
a
matter
of

century
french
and
english
sailors
kept
visiting
the
newfoundland
fisheries
and
by
the
end
of
the
century
the
french
and
english
governments
had
their
attention
definitely
turned
to
the
founding
of
colonies
in
north
america
sidenote
the
london
and
plymouth
companies
in
two
great
companies
were
formed
in
england
for
the
purpose
of
planting
such
colonies
one
of
these
companies
had
its
headquarters
at
london
and
was
called
the
london
company
the
other
had
its
headquarters
at
the
seaport
of
plymouth
in
devonshire
and
was
called
the
plymouth
company
to
the
london
company
the
king
granted
the
coast
of
north
america
from
to
north
latitude
that
is
about
from
cape
fear
to
the
mouth
of
the
rappahannock
to
the
plymouth
company
he
granted
the
coast
from
to
that
is
about
from
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
maine
these
grants
were
to
go
in
straight
strips
or
zones
across
the
continent
from
the
atlantic
ocean
to
the
pacific
almost
nothing
was
then
known
about
american
geography
the
distance
from
ocean
to
ocean
across
mexico
was
not
so
very
great
and
people
did
not
realize
that
further
north
it
was
quite
a
different
thing
as
to
the
middle
strip
starting
from
the
coast
between
the
rappahannock
and
the
hudson
it
was
open
to
the
two
companies
with
the
understanding
that
neither
was
to
plant
a
colony
within
miles
of
any
settlement
already
begun
by
the
other
this
meant
practically
that
it
was
likely
to
be
controlled
by
whichever
company
should
first
come
into
the
field
with
a
flourishing
colony
accordingly
both
companies
made
haste
and
sent
out
settlers
in
the
one
to
the
james
river
the
other
to
the
kennebec
the
first
enterprise
after
much
suffering
resulted
in
the
founding
of
virginia
the
second
ended
in
disaster
and
it
was
not
until
that
the
pilgrims
from
leyden
made
the
beginnings
of
a
permanent
settlement
upon
the
territory
of
the
plymouth
company
sidenote
their
common
charter
these
two
companies
were
at
first
organized
under
a
single
charter
each
was
to
be
governed
by
a
council
in
england
appointed
by
the
king
and
these
councils
were
to
appoint
councils
of
thirteen
to
reside
in
the
colonies
with
powers
practically
unlimited
nevertheless
the
king
covenanted
with
his
colonists
as
follows
also
we
do
for
us
our
heirs
and
successors
declare
by
these
presents
that
all
and

the
said

every
their

which
shall
happen

as
if
they
had
been
abiding
and
born
within
this
our
realm
of
england
or
in
any
other
of
our

this
principle
that
british
subjects
born
in
america
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
political
freedom
as
if
born
in
england
was
one
upon
which
the
colonists
always
insisted
and
it
was
the
repeated
and
persistent
attempts
of
george
iii
to
infringe
it
that
led
the
american
colonies
to
revolt

declare
themselves

of
a

concern

the
creation
of

left
an
abiding
impression
upon
the
map
of
north
america
and
upon
the
organization
of
civil
government
in
the
united
states
let
us
observe
what
was
done
with
the
three
strips
or
zones
into
which
the
country
was
divided
the
northern
or
new
england
zone
assigned
to
the
plymouth
company
the
southern
or
virginia
zone
assigned
to
the
london
company
and
the
central

for
which
the
two
companies
were
so
to
speak
to
run
a
race

cut
off
the
southern
part
of
virginia
the
area
covering
the
present
states
of
north
and
south
carolina
and
georgia
and
it
was
formed
into
a
new
province
called
carolina
in
the
two
groups
of
settlements
which
had
grown
up
along
its
coast
were
definitively
separated
into
north
and
south
carolina
and
in
the
frontier
portion
toward
florida
was
organized
into
the
colony
of
georgia
thus
four
of
the
original
thirteen
states
virginia
the
two
carolinas
and
georgia
were
constituted
in
the
southern

to
this
group
some
writers
add
maryland
founded
in
because
its
territory
had
been
claimed
by
the
london
company
but
the
earliest
settlements
in
maryland

principal
towns
and
almost
the
whole
of
its
territory
come
north
of
latitude
and
within
the
middle

the
middle

between
the
years
and
the
dutch
founded
their
colony
of
new
netherland
upon
the
territory
included
between
the
hudson
and
delaware
rivers
or
as
they
quite
naturally
called
them
the
north
and
south
rivers
they
pushed
their
outposts
up
the
hudson
as
far
as
the
site
of
albany
thus
intruding
far
into
the
northern
zone
in
sweden
planted
a
small
colony
upon
the
west
side
of
delaware
bay
but
in
it
was
surrendered
to
the
dutch
then
in
the
english
took
new
netherland
from
the
dutch
and
charles
ii
granted
the
province
to
his
brother
the
duke
of
york
the
duke
proceeded
to
grant
part
of
it
to
his
friends
berkeley
and
carteret
and
thus
marked
off
the
new
colony
of
new

in
the
region
west
of

was
granted
to
william

in
the
following

penn
bought
from
the
duke
of

the
small
piece
of
territory
upon
which
the
swedes
had
planted
their
colony
delaware
thus
became
an
appendage
to

never
merged
in
it
thus
five
of

thirteen
states
maryland

were
constituted
in
the
middle

as
we
have
already
observed
the
westward
movement
of
population
in
the
united
states
has
largely
followed
the
parallels
of
latitude
and
thus
the
characteristics
of
these
three
original
strips
or
zones
have
with
more
or
less
modification
extended
westward
the

of
new

more
than
miles
distant
in
the

of
oregon
and
within
miles
of
the

may
be
said
in
a
certain
sense
to
have
realized
literally
the
substance
of
king
james
grant
to
the
plymouth
company
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
kinds
of
local
government
described
in
our
earlier
chapters
are
characteristic
respectively
of
the
three
original

the
township

being
exemplified

in
the
northern

the

the
london

did
not
perish
until
after
state
governments
had
been
organized
in
the
colonies
already
founded
upon
their
territories
in
the
colonists
of
virginia
with
the
aid
of
the
more
liberal
spirits
in
the
london
company
secured
for
themselves
a
representative
government
to
the
governor
and
his
council
appointed
in
england
there
was
added
a
general
assembly
composed
of
two
burgesses
from
each
plantation
elected
by
the
inhabitants
this
assembly
the
first
legislative
body
that
ever
sat
in
america
met
on
the
of
july
in
the
choir
of
the
rude
church
at
jamestown
the
dignity
of
the
burgesses
was
preserved
as
in
the
house
of
commons
by
sitting
with
their
hats
on
and
after
offering
prayer
and
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
supremacy
they
proceeded
to
enact
a
number
of
laws
relating
to
public
worship
to
agriculture
and
to
intercourse
with
the
indians
curiously
enough
so
confident
was
the
belief
of
the
settlers
that
they
were
founding
towns
that
they
called
their
representatives
burgesses
and
down
to
the
assembly
continued
to
be
known
as
the
house
of
burgesses
although
towns
refused
to
grow
in
virginia
and
soon
after
counties
were
organized
in
the
burgesses
sat
for
counties
such
were
the
beginnings
of
representative
government
in
virginia
footnote
the
word
plantation
is
here
used
not
in
its
later
and
ordinary
sense
as
the
estate
belonging
to
an
individual
planter
but
in
an
earlier
sense
in
this
early
usage
it
was
equivalent
to
settlement
it
was
used
in
new
england
as
well
as
in
virginia
thus
salem
was
spoken
of
by
the
court

of
massachusetts

the
government
of
massachusetts
is
descended
from
the
dorchester
company
formed
in
england
in
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
trading
in
furs
and
timber
and
catching
fish
on
the
shores
of
massachusetts
bay
after
a
disastrous
beginning
this
company
was
dissolved
but
only
to
be
immediately
reorganized
on
a
greater
scale
in
a
grant
of
the
land
between
the
charles
and
merrimack
rivers
was
obtained
from
the
plymouth
company
and
in
a
charter
was
obtained
from
charles
i
so
many
men
from
the
east
of
england
had
joined
in
the
enterprise
that
it
could
no
longer
be
fitly
called
a
dorchester
company
the
new
name
was
significantly
taken
from
the
new
world
the
charter
created
a
corporation
under
the
style
of
the
governor
and

of
massachusetts
bay
in
new
england
the
freemen
of
the
company
were
to
hold
a
meeting
four
times
a
year
and
they
were
empowered
to
choose
a
governor
a
deputy
governor
and
a
council
of
eighteen
assistants
who
were
to
hold
their
meetings
each
month
they
could
administer
oaths
of
supremacy
and
allegiance
raise
troops
for
the
defence
of
their
possessions
admit
new
associates
into
the
company
and
make
regulations
for
the
management
of
their
business
with
the
vague
and
weak
proviso
that
in
order
to
be
valid
their
enactment
must
in
no
wise
contravene
the
laws
of
england
nothing
was
said
as
to
the
place
where
the
company
should
hold
its
meetings
and
accordingly
after
a
few
months
the
company
transferred
itself
and
its
charter
to
new
england
in
order
that
it
might
carry
out
its
intentions
with
as
little
interference
as
possible
on
the
part
of
the
crown
whether
this
transfer
of
the
charter
was
legally
justifiable
or
not
is
a
question
which
has
been
much
debated
but
with
which
we
need
not
here
vex
ourselves
the
lawyers
of
the
company
were
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
a
instrument
may
be
made
to
admit
of
great
liberty
of
action
under
the
guise
of
a
mere
trading
corporation

puritan
leaders
deliberately
intended
to
found
a
civil

with
their
own
theories

government
sidenote

the

after
their
arrival
in
massachusetts
their
numbers
increased
so
rapidly
that
it
became
impossible
to
have
a
primary
assembly
of
all
the
freemen
and
so
a
representative
assembly
was
devised
after
the
model
of
the
old
english
county
court
the
representatives
sat
for
townships
and
were
called
deputies
at
first
they
sat
in
the
same
chamber
with
the
assistants
but
in
the
legislative
body
was
divided
into
two
chambers
the
deputies
forming
the
lower
house
while
the
upper
was
composed
of
the
assistants
who
were
sometimes
called
magistrates
in
elections
the
candidates
for
the
upper
house
were
put
in
nomination
by
the
general
court
and
voted
on
by
the
freemen
in
general
the
assistants
represented
the
common
or
central
power
of
the
colony
while
the
deputies
represented
the
interests
of
popular
the
former
was
comparatively
an
aristocratic
and
the
latter
a
democratic
body
and
there
were
frequent
disputes
between
the
two
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
governing
body
thus
constituted
was
at
once
a
legislative
and
a
judicial
body
like
the
english
county
court
which
served
as
its
model
inferior
courts
were
organized
at
an
early
date
in
massachusetts
but
the
highest
judicial
tribunal
was
the
legislature
which
was
known
as
the
general
court
it
still
bears
this
name
though
it
long
ago
ceased
to
exercise
judicial
functions

now
as
the
freemen
of
massachusetts
directly
chose
their
governor
and
as
well
as
their
chamber
of
deputies
and
also
took
part
in
choosing
their
council
of
assistants
their
government
was
virtually
that
of
an
independent
republic
the
crown
could
interpose
no
effective
check
upon
its
proceedings
except
by
threatening
to
annul
its
charter
and
send
over
a
viceroy
who
might
be
backed
up
if
need
be
by
military
force
such
threats
were
sometimes
openly
made
but
oftener
hinted
at
they
served
to
make
the
massachusetts
government
somewhat
wary
and
circumspect
but
they
did
not
prevent
it
from
pursuing
a
very
independent
policy
in
many
respects
as
when
for
example
it
persisted
in
allowing
none
but
members
of
the
congregational
church
to
vote
this
measure
by
which
it
was
intended
to
preserve
the
puritan
policy
unchanged
was
extremely
distasteful
to
the
british
government
at
length
in
the
massachusetts
charter
was
annulled
an
attempt
was
made
to
suppress
and
the

was

period

were

was
thus
except
for
its
possession

a

made
similar
to
that

constructed
upon

general
plan
as
the
first
government
of
massachusetts
governors

and
assemblies
were
elected
by
the
people
these
governments
were
made
by
the
settlers
themselves
after
they
had
come
out
from
massachusetts
and
through
a
very
singular
combination
of
circumstances
they
were
confirmed
by
charters
granted
by
charles
ii
in
soon
after
his
return
from
exile
so
thoroughly
republican
were
these
governments
that
they
remained
without

until
in

the

must
observe
that
among
the
counties
of
england
there
were
three
whose
rulers
from
an
early
time
were
allowed
special
privileges
because
cheshire
and
durham
bordered
upon
the
hostile
countries
wales
and
scotland
and
needed
to
be
ever
on
the
alert
their
rulers
the
earls
of
chester
and
the
bishops
of
durham
were
clothed
with
almost
royal
powers
of
command
and
similar
powers
were
afterwards
granted
through
favouritism
to
the
dukes
of

the
three
counties

before
the

had
been

sidenote
other
proprietary
governments
at
first
there
were
other
proprietary
colonies
besides
those
just
mentioned
but
in
course
of
time
the
rights
or
powers
of
their
lords
proprietary
were
resumed
by
the
crown
when
new
netherland
was
conquered
from
the
dutch
it
was
granted
to
the
duke
of
york
as
lord
proprietary
but
after
years
the
duke
ascended
the
throne
as
james
and
so
the
part
of
the
colony
which
he
had
kept
became
the
royal
province
of
new
york
the
part
which
he
had
sold
to
berkeley
and
carteret
remained
for
a
while
the
proprietary
colony
of
new
jersey
sometimes
under
one
government
sometimes
divided
between
two
but
the
rule
of
the
lords
proprietary
was
very
unpopular
and
in
their
rights
were
surrendered
to
the
crown
the
carolinas
and
georgia
were
also
at
first
proprietary
colonies
but
after
a
while
they
willingly
came
under
the
direct
sway
of
the
crown
in
general
the
proprietary
governments
were
unpopular
because
the
lords
proprietary
who
usually
lived
in
england
and
visited
their
colonies
but
seldom
were
apt
to
regard
their
colonies
simply
as
sources
of
personal
income
this
was
not
the
case
with
william
penn
or
the
earlier
calverts
or
with
james
oglethorpe
the
illustrious
founder
of
georgia
but
it
was
too
often
the
case
so
long
as
the
lord
rents
fees
and
other
emoluments
were
duly
collected
he
troubled
himself
very
little
as
to
what
went
on
in
the
colony
if
that
had
been
all
the
colony
would
have
troubled
itself
very
little
about
him
but
the
governor
appointed
by
this
absentee
master
was
liable
to
be
more
devoted
to
his
interests
than
to
those
of
the
people
and
the
civil
service
was
seriously
damaged
by
worthless
favourites
sent
over
from
england
for
whom
the
governor
was
expected
to
find
some
office
that
would
pay
them
a
salary
on
the
whole
it
seemed
less
unsatisfactory
to
have
the
governors
appointed
by
the
crown
and
so
before
the
revolutionary
war
all
the
proprietary
governments
had
fallen
except
those
of
the
penns
and
the
calverts
which
doubtless
survived
because
they
were
the
best
organized
and
best
administered
sidenote
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
there
were
three
forms
of
colonial
government
republican
proprietary
royal
there
were
thus
at
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
war
three
forms
of
state
government
in
the
american
colonies
there
were
the
republican
colonies
in
which
the
governors
were
elected
by
the
people
as
in
rhode
island
and
connecticut
proprietary
colonies
in
which
the
governors
were
appointed
by
hereditary
proprietors
as
in
maryland
pennsylvania
and
delaware
the
royal
colonies
in
which
the
governors
were
appointed
by
the
crown
as
in
georgia
the
two
carolinas
virginia
new
jersey
new
york
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
it
is
customary
to
distinguish
the
republican
colonies
as
colonies
but
that
is
not
an
accurate
distinction
inasmuch
as
the
proprietary
colonies
also
had
charters
and
among
the
royal
colonies
massachusetts
having
been
originally
a
republic
still
had
a
charter
in
which
her
rights
were
so
defined
as
to
place
her
in
a
somewhat
different
position
from
the
other
royal
colonies
so
that
alexander
johnston
with
some
reason
puts
her
in
a
class
by
herself
as
a
colony
footnote
or
as
they
were
sometimes
called
royal
in
the
history
of
massachusetts
many
writers
distinguish
the
period
before
as
the
period
and
the
period
to
as
the
period
sidenote
in
all
three
forms
there
was
a
representative
assembly
which
alone
could
impose
taxes
these
differences
it
will
be
observed
related
to
the
character
and
method
of
filling
the
governor
office
in
the
republican
colonies
the
governor
naturally
represented
the
interests
of
the
people
in
the
proprietary
colonies
he
was
the
agent
of
the
penns
or
the
calverts
in
the
royal
colonies
he
was
the
agent
of
the
king
all
the
thirteen
colonies
alike
had
a
legislative
assembly
elected
by
the
people
the
basis
of
representation
might
be
different
in
different
colonies
as
we
have
seen
that
in
massachusetts
the
delegates
represented
townships
whereas
in
virginia
they
represented
counties
but
in
all
alike
the
assembly
was
a
truly
representative
body
and
in
all
alike
it
was
the
body
that
controlled
the
expenditure
of
public
money
these
representative
assemblies
arose
spontaneously
because
the
founders
of
the
american
colonies
were
englishmen
used
from
time
immemorial
to
tax
themselves
and
govern
themselves
as
they
had
been
wont
to
vote
for
representatives
in
england
instead
of
leaving
things
to
be
controlled
by
the
king
so
now
they
voted
for
representatives
in
maryland
or
new
york
instead
of
leaving
things
to
be
controlled
by
the
governor
the
spontaneousness
of
all
this
is
quaintly
and
forcibly
expressed
by
the
great
tory
historian
hutchinson
who
tells
us
that
in
the
year
a
house
of
burgesses
in
virginia
as
if
it
had
been
the
mumps
or
original
sin
or
any
of
those
things
that
people
can
not
help
having
sidenote
the
governor
council
was
a
kind
of
upper
house
this
representative
assembly
was
the
lower
house
in
the
colonial
legislatures
the
governor
always
had
a
council
to
advise
with
him
and
assist
him
in
his
executive
duties
in
imitation
of
the
king
privy
council
in
england
but
in
nearly
all
the
colonies
this
council
took
part
in
the
work
of
legislation
and
thus
sat
as
an
upper
house
with
more
or
less
power
of
reviewing
and
amending
the
acts
of
the
assembly
in
pennsylvania
as
already
observed
the
council
refrained
from
this
legislative
work
and
so
until
some
years
after
the
revolution
the
pennsylvania
legislature
was
the
members
of
the
council
were
appointed
in
different
ways
sometimes
by
the
king
or
the
lord
proprietary
or
as
in
massachusetts
by
the
outgoing
legislature
or
as
in
connecticut
they
were
elected
by
the
people
sidenote
the
colonial
government
was
like
the
english
system
in
miniature
thus
all
the
colonies
had
a
government
framed
after
the
model
to
which
the
people
had
been
accustomed
in
england
it
was
like
the
english
system
in
miniature
the
governor
answering
to
the
king
and
the
legislature
usually
answering
to
parliament
and
as
quarrels
between
king
and
parliament
were
not
uncommon
so
quarrels
between
governor
and
legislature
were
very
frequent
indeed
except
in
connecticut
and
rhode
island
the
royal
governors
representing
british
imperial
ideas
rather
than
american
ideas
were
sure
to
come
into
conflict
with
the
popular
assemblies
and
sometimes
became
the
objects
of
bitter
popular
hatred
the
disputes
were
apt
to
be
concerned
with
questions
in
which
taxation
was
involved
such
as
the
salaries
of
crown
officers
the
appropriations
for
war
with
the
indians
and
so
on
such
disputes
bred
more
or
less
popular
discontent
but
the
struggle
did
not
become
flagrant
so
long
as
the
british
parliament
refrained
from
meddling
with
it
sidenote
the
americans
never
admitted
the
supremacy
of
parliament
the
americans
never
regarded
parliament
as
possessing
any
rightful
authority
over
their
internal
affairs
when
the
earliest
colonies
were
founded
it
was
the
general
theory
that
the
american
wilderness
was
part
of
the
king
private
domain
and
not
subject
to
the
control
of
parliament
this
theory
lived
on
in
america
but
died
out
in
england
on
the
one
hand
the
americans
had
their
own
legislatures
which
stood
to
them
in
the
place
of
parliament
the
authority
of
parliament
was
derived
from
the
fact
that
it
was
a
representative
body
but
it
did
not
represent
americans
accordingly
the
americans
held
that
the
relation
of
each
american
colony
to
great
britain
was
like
the
relation
between
england
and
scotland
in
the
seventeenth
century
england
and
scotland
then
had
the
same
king
but
separate
parliaments
and
the
english
parliament
could
not
make
laws
for
scotland
such
is
the
connection
between
sweden
and
norway
at
the
present
day
they
have
the
same
king
but
each
country
legislates
for
itself
so
the
american
colonists
held
that
virginia
for
example
and
great
britain
had
the
same
king
but
each
its
independent
legislature
and
so
with
the
other
colonies
there
were
thirteen
parliaments
in
america
each
as
sovereign
within
its
own
sphere
as
the
parliament
at
westminster
and
the
latter
had
no
more
right
to
tax
the
people
of
massachusetts
than
the
massachusetts
legislature
had
to
tax
the
people
of
virginia
in
one
respect
however
the
americans
did
admit
that
parliament
had
a
general
right
of
supervision
over
all
parts
of
the
british
empire
maritime
commerce
seemed
to
be
as
much
the
affair
of
one
part
of
the
empire
as
another
and
it
seemed
right
that
it
should
be
regulated
by
the
central
parliament
at
westminster
accordingly
the
americans
did
not
resist
taxes
as
long
as
they
seemed
to
be
imposed
for
purely
commercial
purposes
but
they
were
quick
to
resist
direct
taxation
and
taxes
likewise
as
soon
as
these
began
to
form
a
part
of
schemes
for
extending
the
authority
of
parliament
over
the
colonies
footnote
except
in
the
regulation
of
maritime
commerce
in
england
on
the
other
hand
this
theory
that
the
americans
were
subject
to
the
king
authority
but
not
to
that
of
parliament
naturally
became
unintelligible
after
the
king
himself
had
become
virtually
subject
to
parliament
the
stuart
kings
might
call
themselves
kings
by
the
grace
of
god
but
since
the
sovereigns
of
great
britain
owe
their
seat
upon
the
throne
to
an
act
of
parliament
footnote
in
england
there
grew
up
the
theory
of
the
imperial
supremacy
of
parliament
to
suppose
that
the
king
american
subjects
were
not
amenable
to
the
authority
of
parliament
seemed
like
supposing
that
a
stream
could
rise
higher
than
its
source
besides
after
the
british
empire
began
to
expand
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
the
business
of
parliament
became
more
and
more
imperial
it
could
make

the
east

why
not
then
for
the
company
of
massachusetts
bay
sidenote
conflict
between
the
british
and
the
american
theories
was
precipitated
by
george
iii
thus
the
american
theory
of
the
situation
was
irreconcilable
with
the
british
theory
and
when
parliament
in
with
no
unfriendly
purpose
began
laying
taxes
upon
the
americans
thus
invading
the
province
of
the
colonial
legislatures
the
americans
refused
to
submit
the
ensuing
quarrel
might
doubtless
have
been
peacefully
adjusted
had
not
the
king
george
happened
to
be
entertaining
political
schemes
which
were
threatened
with
ruin
if
the
americans
should
get
a
fair
hearing
for
their
side
of
the
case
thus
political
intrigue
came
in
to
make
the
situation
hopeless
when
a
state
of
things
arises
with
which
men

of

the
primitive
method
which
was
in
vogue
before

began
to
exist
they
fight
it
out
and
so
we
had
our
revolutionary
war
and
became
separated
politically
from
great
britain
it
is
worthy
of
note
in
this
connection
that
the
last
act
of
parliament
which
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
was
the
regulating
act
of
april
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
change
the
government
of
massachusetts
this
act
provided
that
members
of
the
council
should
be
appointed
by
the
royal
governor
that
they
should
be
paid
by
the
crown
and
thus
be
kept
subservient
to
it
that
the
principal
executive
and
judicial
officers
should
be
likewise
paid
by
the
crown
and
that
should
be
prohibited
except
for
the
sole
purpose
of
electing
town
officers
other
unwarrantable
acts
were
passed
at
the
same
time
but
this
was
the
worst
troops
were
sent
over
to
aid
in
enforcing
this
act
the
people

refused
to
recognize
its
validity

sidenote
committees
of

during
the
earlier
part
of
the
revolutionary
war
most
of
the
states
had
some
kind
of
provisional
government
the
case
of
massachusetts
may
serve
as
an
illustration
there
as
in
the
other
colonies
the
governor
had
the
power
of
dissolving
the
assembly
this
was
like
the
king
power
of
dissolving
parliament
in
the
days
of
the
stuarts
it
was
then
a
dangerous
power
in
modern
england
there
is
nothing
dangerous
in
a
dissolution
of
parliament
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
useful
device
for
ascertaining
the
wishes
of
the
people
for
a
new
house
of
commons
must
be
elected
immediately
but
in
old
times
the
king
would
turn
his
parliament
out
of
doors
and
as
long
as
he
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
enough
money
to
carry
on
government
according
to
his
own
notions
he
would
not
order
a
new
election
fortunately
such
periods
were
not
very
long
the
latest
instance
was
in
the
reign
of
charles
i
who
got
on
without
a
parliament
from
to
in
the
american
colonies
the
dissolution
of
the
assembly
by
the
governor
was
not
especially
dangerous
but
it
sometimes
made
mischief
by
delaying
needed
legislation
during
the
few
years
preceding
the
revolution
the
assemblies
were
so
often
dissolved
that
it
became
necessary
for
the
people
to
devise
some
new
way
of
getting
their
representatives
together
to
act
for
the
colony
in
massachusetts
this
end
was
attained
by
the
famous
committees
of
correspondence
no
one
could
deny
that
were
legal
or
that
the
people
of
one
township
had
a
right
to
ask
advice
from
the
people
of
another
township
accordingly
each
township
appointed
a
committee
to
correspond
or
confer
with
committees
from
other
townships
this
system
was
put
into
operation
by
samuel
adams
in
and
for
the
next
two
years
the
popular
resistance
to
the
crown
was
organized
by
these
committees
for
example
before
the
tea
was
thrown
into
boston
harbour
the
boston
committee
sought
and
received
advice
from
every
township
in
massachusetts
and
the
treatment
of
the
was
from
first
to
last
directed
by
the
committees
of
boston
and
five
neighbour
towns

kings

so
multiplied

sidenote
provincial

in
a
further
step
was
taken
as
parliament
had
overthrown
the
old
government
and
sent
over
general
gage
as
military
governor
to
put
its
new
system
into
operation
the
people
defied
and
ignored
gage
and
the
townships
elected
delegates
to
meet
together
in
what
was
called
a
provincial
congress
the
president
of
this
congress
was
the
chief
provincial
executive
officer
of
the
commonwealth
and
there
was
a
small
executive
council
known
as
the
committee
of
safety
sidenote
provisional
governments
governors
and
presidents
this
provisional
government
lasted
about
a
year
in
the
summer
of
the
people
went
further
they
fell
back
upon
their
charter
and
proceeded
to
carry
on
their
government
as
it
had
been
carried
on
before
except
that
the
governor
was
left
out
altogether
the
people
in
elected
their
representatives
to
a
general
assembly
as
of
old
and
this
assembly
chose
a
council
of
members
to
sit
as
an
upper
house
the
president
of
the
council
was
the
foremost
executive
officer
of
the
commonwealth
but
he
had
not
the
powers
of
a
governor
he
was
no
more
the
governor
than
the
president
of
our
federal
senate
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
powers
of
the
governor
were
really
vested
in
the
council
which
was
an
executive
as
well
as
a
legislative
body
and
the
president
was
its
chairman
indeed
the
title
president
is
simply
the
latin
for
chairman
he
who
presides
or
sits
before
an
assembly
in
it
was
a
more
modest
title
than
governor
and
had
not
the
smack
of
which
lingered
about
the
latter
governors
had
made
so
much
trouble
that
people
were
distrustful
of
the
office
and
at
first
it
was
thought
that
the
council
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
the
executive
work
that
was
to
be
done
several
of
the
states
thus
organized
their
governments
with
a
council
at
the
head
instead
of
a
governor
and
hence
in
reading
about
that
period
one
often
comes
across
the
title
president
somewhat
loosely
used
as
if
equivalent
to
governor
thus
in
we
find
benjamin
franklin
called
president
of
pennsylvania
meaning
president
of
the
council
of
pennsylvania
but
this
arrangement
did
not
prove
satisfactory
and
did
not
last
long
it
soon
appeared
that
for
executive
work
one
man
is
better
than
a
group
of
men
in
massachusetts
in
the
old
charter
was
replaced
by
a
new
written
constitution
under
which
was
formed
the
state
government
which
with
some
emendations
in
detail
has
continued
to
the
present
day
before
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
all
the
states
except
connecticut
and
rhode
island
which
had
always
been
practically
independent
thus
remodelled
their
governments
sidenote
origin
of
the
senates
these
changes
however
were
very
conservative
the
old
form
of
government
was
closely
followed
first
there
was
the
governor
elected
in
some
states
by
the
legislature
in
others
by
the
people
then
there
was
the
legislature
of
which
the
lower
house
was
the
same
institution
after
the
revolution
that
it
had
been
before
the
upper
house
or
council
was
retained
but
in
a
somewhat
altered
form
the
americans
had
been
used
to
having
the
acts
of
their
popular
assemblies
reviewed
by
a
council
and
so
they
retained
this
revisory
body
as
an
upper
house
but
the
fashion
of
copying
names
and
titles
from
the
ancient
roman
republic
was
then
prevalent
and
accordingly
the
upper
house
was
called
a
senate
there
was
a
higher
property
qualification
for
senators
than
for
representatives
and
generally
their
terms
of
service
were
longer
in
some
states
they
were
chosen
by
the
people
in
others
by
the
lower
house
in
maryland
they
were
chosen
by
a
special
college
of
electors
an
arrangement
which
was
copied
in
our
federal
government
in
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
most
of
the
states
there
was
a

had

thus
our

governments
came
to
be

on
a
small
scale
of
the
king
lords
and
commons
of
england
the
governor
answered
to
the
king
with
his
dignity
very
much
curtailed
by
election
for
a
short
period
the
senate
answered
to
the
house
of
lords
except
in
being
a
representative
and
not
a
hereditary
body
it
was
supposed
to
represent
more
especially
that
part
of
the
community
which
was
possessed
of
most
wealth
and
consideration
and
in
several
states
the
senators
were
apportioned
with
some
reference
to
the
amount
of
taxes
paid
by
different
parts
of
the
state
when
new
york
made
its
senate
a
supreme
court
of
appeal
it
was
in
deliberate
imitation
of
the
house
of
lords
on
the
other
hand
the
house
of
representatives
answered
to
the
house
of
commons
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
days
when
its
power
was
really
limited
by
that
of
the
upper
house
and
the

at
the
present
day
the
english
of
commons
is
a
supreme
body
in

of
a
serious
difference
with
the
house
of
lords
the
upper
house
must
yield
or
else
new
peers
will
be
created
in
sufficient
number
to
reverse
its
vote
and
the
lords
always
yield
before
this
point
is
reached
so
too
though
the
veto
power
of
the
sovereign
has
never
been
explicitly
abolished
it
has
not
been
exercised
since
and
would
not
now
be
tolerated
for
a
moment
in
america
there
is
no
such
supreme
body
the
bill
passed
by
the
lower
house
may
be
thrown
out
by
the
upper
house
or
if
it
passes
both
it
may
be
vetoed
by
the
governor
and
unless
the
bill
can
again
pass
both
houses
by
more
than
a
simple
majority
the
veto
will
stand
in
most
of
the
states
a
vote
in
the
affirmative
is
required

have
undergone

chiefly
in

of
abolishing

qualifications
for
offices
making
the

universal

electing

that
were
formerly
appointed

there

is
no

any

usual
difference
being
that
the
senate
consists
of
fewer
members
who
represent
larger
districts
usually
too
the
term
of
the
representatives
is
two
years
and
the
whole
house
is
elected
at
the
same
time
while
the
term
of
senators
is
four
years
and
half
the
number
are
elected
every
two
years
this
system
of
legislatures
is
probably
retained
chiefly
through
a
spirit
of
conservatism
because
it
is
what
we
are
used
to
but
it
no
doubt
has
real
advantages
in
checking
hasty
legislation
people
are
always
wanting
to
have
laws
made
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
their
laws
would
be
pernicious

it
is
well
not
to
have
legislation
made
too
easy

suffrage
by
which
the

almost
universal

made
so
easy
sidenote
separation
between
legislation
and
the
executive
a
peculiar
feature
of
american
governments
and
something
which
it
is
hard
for
europeans
to
understand
is
the
almost
complete
separation
between
the
executive
and
the
legislative
departments
in
european
countries
the
great
executive
officers
are
either
members
of
the
legislature
or
at
all
events
have
the
right
to
be
present
at
its
meetings
and
take
part
in
its
discussions
and
as
they
generally
have
some
definite
policy
by
which
they
are
to
stand
or
fall
they
are
wont
to
initiate
legislation
and
to
guide
the
course
of
the
discussion
but
in
america
the
legislatures
having
no
such
central
points
about
which
to
rally
their
forces
carry
on
their
work
in
an
aimless
rambling
sort
of
way
through
the
agency
of
many
standing
committees
when
a
measure
is
proposed
it
is
referred
to
one
of
the
committees
for
examination
before
the
house
will
have
anything
to
do
with
it
such
a
preliminary
examination
is
of
course
necessary
where
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
legislative
work
going
on
but
the
private
and
disconnected
way
in
which
our
committee
work
is
done
tends
to
prevent
full
and
instructive
discussion
in
the
house
to
make
the
mass
of
legislation
always
chaotic
enough
somewhat
more
chaotic
and
to
facilitate
the
various
evil
devices
of
lobbying
and
in
pointing
out
this
inconvenience
attendant
upon
the
american
plan
of
separating
the
executive
and
legislative
departments
i
must
not
be
understood
as
advocating
the
european
plan
as
preferable
for
this
country
the
evils
that
inevitably
flow
from
any
fundamental
change
in
the
institutions
of
a
country
are
apt
to
be
much
more
serious
than
the
evils
which
the
change
is
intended
to
remove
political
government
is
like
a
plant
a
little
watering
and
pruning
do
very
well
for
it
but
the
less
its
roots
are
fooled
with
the
better
in
the
american
system
of
government
the
independence
of
the
executive
department
with
reference
to
the
legislative
is
fundamental
and
on
the
whole
it
is
eminently
desirable
one
of
the
most
serious
of
the
dangers
which
beset
democratic
government
especially
where
it
is
conducted
on
a
great
scale
is
the
danger
that
the
majority
for
the
time
being
will
use
its
power
tyrannically
and
unscrupulously
as
it
is
always
tempted
to
do
against
such
unbridled
democracy
we
have
striven
to
guard
ourselves
by
various
constitutional
checks
and
balances
our
written
constitutions
and
our
supreme
court
are
important
safeguards
as
will
be
shown
below
the
independence
of
our
executives
is
another
important
safeguard
but
if
our
executive
departments
were
mere
committees
of
the

we
must
remember
that
government
is
necessarily
a
cumbrous
affair
however
conducted
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
governor
is
a
part
of
the
legislature
is
when
he
signs
or
vetoes
a
bill
then
he
is
virtually
in
himself
a
third
house
as
an
executive
officer
the
governor
is
far
less
powerful
than
in
the
colonial
times
we
shall
see
the
reason
of
this
after
we
have
enumerated
some
of
the
principal
offices
in
the
executive
department
there
is
always
a
secretary
of
state
whose
main
duty
is
to
make
and
keep
the
records
of
state
transactions
there
is
always
a
state
treasurer
and
usually
a
state
auditor
or
comptroller
to
examine
the
public
accounts
and
issue
the
warrants
without
which
the
treasurer
can
not
pay
out
a
penny
of
the
state
money
there
is
almost
always
an
to
appear
for
the
state
in
the
supreme
court
in
all
cases
in
which
the
state
is
a
party
and
in
all
prosecutions
for
capital
offences
he
also
exercises
some
superintendence
over
the
district
attorneys
and
acts
as
legal
adviser
to
the
governors
and
the
legislature
there
is
also
in
many
states
a
superintendent
of
education
and
in
some
there
are
boards
of
education
of
health
of
lunacy
and
charity
bureau
of
agriculture
commissioners
of
prisons
of
railroads
of
mines
of
harbours
of
immigration
and
so
on
sometimes
such
boards
are
appointed
by
the
governor
but
such
officers
as
the
secretary
of
state
the
treasurer
auditor
and
are
in
almost
all
the
states
elected
by
the
people
they
are
not
responsible
to
the
governor
but
to
the
people
who
elect
them
they
are
not
subordinate
to
the
governor
but
are
rather
his
colleagues
strictly
speaking
the
governor
is
not
the
head
of
the
executive
department
but
a
member
of
it
the
executive
department
is
parcelled
out
in
several
pieces
and
his
is
one
of
the
pieces

the
ordinary
functions
of
the
governor
are
four
in
number
he
sends
a
message
to
the
legislature
at
the
beginning
of
each
session
recommending
such
measures
as
he
would
like
to
see
embodied
in
legislation
he
is
of
the
state
militia
and
as
such
can
assist
the
sheriff
of
a
county
in
putting
down
a
riot
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
a
war
on
such
occasions
the
governor
may
become
a
personage
of
immense
importance
as
for
example
in
our
civil
war
when
president
lincoln
demands
for
troops
met
with
such
prompt
response
from
the
men
who
will
be
known
to
history
as
the
great
war
governors
the
governor
is
invested
with
the
royal
prerogative
of
pardoning
criminals
or
commuting
the
sentences
pronounced
upon
them
by
the
courts
this
power
belongs
to
kings
in
accordance
with
the
old
feudal
notion
that
the
king
was
the
source
or
fountain
of
justice
when
properly
used
it
affords
an
opportunity
for
rectifying
some
injustice
for
which
the
ordinary
machinery
of
the
law
could
not
provide
or
for
making
such
allowances
for
extraordinary
circumstances
as
the
court
could
not
properly
consider
in
our
country
it
is
too
often
improperly
used
to
enable
the
worst
criminals
to
escape
due
punishment
just
because
it
is
a
disagreeable
duty
to
hang
them
such
misplaced
clemency
is
pleasant
for
the
murderers
but
it
makes
life
less
secure
for
honest
men
and
women
and
in
the
less
civilized
regions
of
our
country
it
encourages
lynch
law
in
all
the
states
except
rhode
island
delaware
ohio
and
north
carolina
the
governor
has
a
veto
upon
the
acts
of
the
legislature
as
above
explained
and
in
ordinary
times
this
power
which
is
not
executive
but
legislative
is
probably
the
governor
most
important
and
considerable
power
in
thirteen
of
the
states
the
governor
can
veto
particular
items
in
a
bill
for
the
appropriation
of
public
money
while
at
the
same
time
he
approves
the
rest
of
the
bill
this
is
a
most
important
safeguard
against
corruption
because
where
the
governor
does
not
have
this
power
it
is
possible
to
make
appropriations
for
unworthy
or
scandalous
purposes
along
with
appropriations
for
matters
of
absolute
necessity
and
then
to
lump
them
all
together
in
the
same
bill
so
that
the
governor
must
either
accept
the
bad
along
with
the
good
or
reject
the
good
along
with
the
bad
it
is
a
great
gain
when
the
governor
can
select
the
items
and
veto
some
while
approving
others
in
such
matters
the
governor
is
often
more
honest
and
discreet
than
the
legislature
if
for
no
other
reason
because
he
is
one
man
and
responsibility
can
be
fixed
upon
him
more
clearly
than
upon
two
or
three
hundred
such
in
brief
outline
is
the
framework
of
the
american
state
governments
but
our
account
would
be
very
incomplete
without
some
mention
of
three
points
all
of
them
especially
characteristic
of
the
american
state
and
likely
to
be
overlooked
or
misunderstood
by
europeans
sidenote
in
building
the
state
the
local
was
left
unimpaired
while
we
have
rapidly
built
up
one
of
the
greatest
empires
yet
seen
upon
the
earth
we
have
left
our
substantially
unimpaired
in
the
process
this
is
exemplified
in
two
ways
first
in
the
relationship
of
the
state
to
its
towns
and
counties
and
secondly
in
its
relationship
to
the
federal
government
over
the
township
and
county
governments
the
state
exercises
a
general
supervision
indeed
it
clothes
them
with
their
authority
townships
and
counties
have
no
sovereignty
the
state
on
the
other
hand
has
many
elements
of
sovereignty
but
it
does
not
use
them
to
obliterate
or
unduly
restrict
the
control
of
the
townships
and
counties
over
their
own
administrative
work
it
leaves
the
local
governments
to
administer
themselves
as
a
rule
there
is
only
just
enough
state
supervision
to
harmonize
the
working
of
so
many
local
administrations
such
a
system
of
government
comes
as
near
as
possible
toward
making
all
american
citizens
participate
actively
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
it
generates
and
nourishes
a
public
spirit
and
a
universal
acquaintance
with
matters
of
public
interest
such
as
has
probably
never
before
been
seen
in
any
great
country
public
spirit
of
equal
or
greater
intensity
may
have
been
witnessed
in
small
and
highly
educated
communities
such
as
ancient
athens
or
mediaeval
florence
but
in
the
united
states
it
is
diffused
over
an
area
equal
to
the
whole
of
europe
among
the
leading
countries
of
the
world
england
is
the
one
which
comes
nearest
to
the
united
states
in
the
general
diffusion
of
enlightened
public
spirit
and
political
capacity
throughout
all
classes
of
society
sidenote
instructive
contrast
with
france
a
very
notable
contrast
to
the
which
has
produced
such
admirable
results
is
to
be
seen
in
france
and
as
contrasts
are
often
instructive
let
me
mention
one
or
two
features
of
the
french
government
there
is
nothing
like
the
irregularity
and
spontaneity
there
that
we
have
observed
in
our
survey
of
the
united
states
everything
is
symmetrical
france
is
divided
into
most
of
them
larger
than
the
state
of
delaware
some
of
them
nearly
as
large
as
connecticut
and
the
administration
of
one
department
is
exactly
like
that
of
all
the
others
the
chief
officer
of
the
department
is
the
prefect
who
is
appointed
by
the
minister
of
the
interior
at
paris
the
prefect
is
treasurer
recruiting
officer
school
superintendent
all
in
one
and
he
appoints
nearly
all
inferior
officers
the
department
has
a
council
elected
by
universal
suffrage
but
it
has
no
power
of
assessing
taxes
the
central
legislature
in
paris
decides
for
it
how
much
money
it
shall
use
and
how
it
shall
raise
it
the
department
council
is
not
even
allowed
to
express
its
views
on
political
matters
it
can
only
attend
to
purely
local
details
of
administration
the
smallest
civil
division
in
france
is
the
which
may
be
either
rural
or
urban
the
commune
has
a
municipal
council
which
elects
a
mayor
but
when
once
elected
the
mayor
becomes
directly
responsible
to
the
prefect
of
the
department
and
through
him
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
if
these
greater
officers
do
not
like
what
the
mayor
does
they
can
overrule
his
acts
or
even
suspend
him
from
office
or
upon
their
complaint
the
president
of
the
republic
can
remove
him
sidenote
in
france
whether
it
is
nominally
a
despotic
empire
or
a
republic
at
the
top
there
is
scarcely
any
at
the
bottom
hence
government
there
rests
on
an
insecure
foundation
thus
in
france
people
do
not
manage
their
own
affairs
but
they
are
managed
for
them
by
a
hierarchy
of
officials
with
its
head
at
paris
this
system
was
devised
by
the
constituent
assembly
in
and
wrought
into
completeness
by
napoleon
in
the
men
who
devised
it
in
actually
supposed
that
they
were
inaugurating
a
system
or
political
freedom
and
unquestionably
it
was
a
vast
improvement
upon
the
wretched
system
which
it
supplanted
but
as
contrasted
with
american
methods
and
institutions
it
is
difficult
to
call
it
anything
else
than
a
highly
centralized
despotism
it
has
gone
on
without
essential
change
through
all
the
revolutions
which
have
overtaken
france
since
the
people
have
from
time
to
time
overthrown
an
unpopular
government
at
paris
but
they
have
never
assumed
the
direct
control
of
their
own
affairs
hence
it
is
commonly
remarked
that
while
the
general
intelligence
of
the
french
people
is
very
high
their
intelligence
in
political
matters
is
comparatively
speaking
very
low
some
persons
try
to
explain
this
by
a
reference
to
peculiarities
of
race
but
if
we
americans
were
to
set
about
giving
to
the
state
governments
things
to
do
that
had
better
be
done
by
counties
and
towns
and
giving
the
federal
government
things
to
do
that
had
better
be
done
by
the
states
it
would
not
take
many
generations
to
dull
the
keen
edge
of
our
political
capacity
we
should
lose
it
as
inevitably
as
the
most
consummate
of
pianists
will
lose
his
facility
if
he
stops
practising
it
is
therefore
a
fact
of
cardinal
importance
that
in
the
united
states
the
local
governments
of
township
county
and
city
are
left
to
administer
themselves
instead
of
being
administered
by
a
great
bureau
with
its
head
at
the
state
capital
in
a
political
society
thus
constituted
from
the
beginning
it
has
proved
possible
to
build
up
our
federal
union
in
which
the
states
while
for
certain
purposes
indissolubly
united
at
the
same
time
for
many
other
purposes
retain
their
intact
as
in
the
case
of
other
aggregates
the
nature
of
the
american
political
aggregate
has
been
determined
by
the

of
its
political
units

of
the
functions
retained
by

us
observe
how
great
are
the
functions
retained
by
our
states
under
the
conditions
of
our
federal
union
the
powers
granted
to
our

such
as
the
control
over
international
questions
war

peace
the
military
forces
the
coinage
patents
and
copyrights
and
the
regulation
of

countries
all
these
are
powers
relating
to
matters
that
affect
all
the
states
but
could
not
be
regulated
harmoniously
by
the
separate
action
of
the
states
in
order
the
more
completely
to
debar
the
states
from
meddling
with
such
matters
they
are
expressly
prohibited
from
entering
into

other
or
with

are
the
limitations

sovereignty
imposed
upon
the
states
within
the
federal

with
the
vast

of
the
state

these
limitations
seem

the

seems
to
warrant
it

may
commit
the
accused
person
for
trial
before
a

the

usually

similar

from

and
from

grade
of

thirdly
there
are
having
original
jurisdiction
over
the
most
important
cases
and
over

of

so
that
they
do
not

the
english

up

from

fourthly
there
is
in
every
state
a
which
generally
has
no
original
jurisdiction
but
only
hears
appeals
from
the
decisions
of
the
other
courts
in

there
is
a
supremest
court
styled
the
of
which
has
the
power
of
revising

of

sidenote
elective
and
appointive
judges
in
the
thirteen
colonies
the
judges
were
appointed
by
the
governor
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
council
and
they
held
office
during
life
or
good
behaviour
among
the
changes
made
in
our
state
constitutions
since
the
revolution
there
have
been
few
more
important
than
those
which
have
affected
the
position
of
the
judges
in
most
of
the
states
they
are
now
elected
by
the
people
for
a
term
of
years
sometimes
as
short
as
two
years
there
is
a
growing
feeling
that
this
change
was
a
mistake
it
seems
to
have
lowered
the
general
character
of
the
judiciary
the
change
was
made
by
reasoning
from
analogy
it
was
supposed
that
in
a
free
country
all
offices
ought
to
be
elective
and
for
short
terms
but
the
case
of
a
judge
is
not
really
analogous
to
that
of
executive
officers
like
mayors
and
governors
and
presidents
the
history
of
popular
liberty
is
much
older
than
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
to
an
instance
in
which
popular
liberty
has
ever
suffered
from
the
life
tenure
of
judges
on
the
contrary
the
judge
ought
to
be
as
independent
as
possible
of
all
transient
phases
of
popular
sentiment
and
american
experience
during
the
past
century
seems
to
teach
us
that
in
the
few
states
where
the
appointing
of
judges
during
life
or
good
behaviour
has
prevailed
the
administration
of
justice
has
been
better
than
in
the
states
where
the
judges
have
been
elected
for
specified
terms
since
there
has
been
a
marked
tendency
toward
lengthening
the
terms
of
elected
judges
and
in
several
states
there
has
been
a
return
to
the
old
method
of
appointing
judges
by
the
governor
subject
to
confirmation
by
the
senate
it
is
one
of
the
excellent
features
of
our
system
of
federal
government
that
the
several
states
can
thus
try
experiments
each
for
itself
and
learn
by
comparison
of
results
when
things
are
all
trimmed
down
to
a
dead
level
of
uniformity
by
the

power

of
them
the
third
point
which
i
had
in

is
so
remarkable
and
important
as
to
require
a
chapter
all
to
itself
in
the
american
state
the
legislature
is
not
supreme
but
has
limits
to
its
authority
prescribed
by
a
written
document
known
as
the
constitution
and
if
the
legislature
happens
to
pass
a
law
which
violates
the
constitution
then
whenever
a
specific
case
happens
to
arise
in
which
this
statute
is
involved
it
can
be
brought
before
the
courts
and
the
decision
of
the
court
if
adverse
to
the
statute
annuls
it
and
renders
it
of
no
effect
the
importance
of
this
feature
of
civil
government
in
the
united
states
can
hardly
be
overrated
it
marks
a
momentous
advance
in
civilization
and
it
is
especially
interesting
as
being
peculiarly
american
almost
everything
else
in
our
fundamental
institutions
was
brought
by
our
forefathers
in
a
more
or
less
highly
developed
condition
from
england
but
the
development
of
the
written
constitution
with
the
consequent
relation
of

power
has

our

the

existed
a
great
while
ago
perhaps
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
just
when
they
began
to
exist
it
was
formerly
supposed
by
such
profound
thinkers
as
locke
and
such
persuasive
writers
as
rousseau
that
when
the
first
men
came
together
to
live
in
civil
society
they
made
a
sort
of
contract
with
one
another
as
to
what
laws
they
would
have
what
beliefs
they
would
entertain
what
customs
they
would
sanction
and
so
forth
this
theory
of
the
social
contract
was
once
famous
and
exerted
a
notable
influence
on
political
history

it
is
still
interesting
in
the

way
that
and
wooden
frigates
and
powdered
wigs
are
interesting
but
we
now
know
that
men
lived
in
civil
society
with
complicated
laws
and
customs
and
creeds
for
many
thousand
years
before
the
notion
had
ever
entered
anybody

that
things
could

regulated

that
notion
we
owe
chiefly
to
the
ancient
romans
and
it
took

several
centuries
to
comprehend
the
idea
and
put

into

we

a
debt
of
gratitude
for
it
the
custom
of
regulating
business
and
politics
and
the
affairs
of
life
generally
by
voluntary
but
binding
agreements
is
something
without
which
we
moderns
would
not
think
life
worth
living
it
was
after
the
roman
world
that
is

for
in
the
middle
ages
the
two
terms
were
synonymous
had
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
idea
of
contract
that
the
practice
grew
up
of
granting
written
charters
to
towns
or
monasteries
or
other
corporate
bodies
the
charter
of
a
mediaeval
town
was
a
kind
of
written
contract
by
which
the
town
obtained
certain
specified
immunities
or
privileges
from
the
sovereign
or
from
a
great
feudal
lord
in
exchange
for
some
specified
service
which
often
took
the
form
of
a
money
payment
it
was
common
enough
for
a
town
to
buy
liberty
for
hard
cash
just
as
a
man
might
buy
a
farm
the
word
originally
meant
simply
a
paper
or
written
document
and
it
was
often
applied
to
deeds
for
the
transfer
of
real
estate
in
contracts
of
such
importance
papers
or
parchment
documents
were
drawn
up
and
carefully
preserved
as
irrefragable
evidences
of
the
transaction
and
so
in
quite
significant
phrase
the
towns
zealously
guarded
their
charters
as
the
of
their
liberties
sidenote
the
great
charter
after
a
while
the
word
charter
was
applied
in
england
to
a
particular
document
which
specified
certain
important
concessions
forcibly
wrung
by
the
people
from
a
most
unwilling
sovereign
this
document
was
called
or
the
great
charter
signed
at
runnymede
june
by
john
king
of
england
after
the
king
had
signed
it
and
gone
away
to
his
room
he
rolled
in
a
mad
fury
on
the
floor
screaming
curses
and
gnawing
sticks
and
straw
in
the
impotence
of
his
wrath
perhaps
it
would
be
straining
words
to
call
a
transaction
in
which
the
consent
was
so
a
contract
but
the
idea
of
magna
charta
was
derived
from
that
of
the
town
charters
with
which
people
were
already
familiar
thus
a
charter
came
to
mean
a
grant
made
by
the
sovereign
either
to
the
whole
people
or
to
a
portion
of
them
securing
to
them
the
enjoyment
of
certain
rights
now
in
legal
usage
a
charter
differs
from
a
constitution
in
this
that
the
former
is
granted
by
the
sovereign
while
the
latter
is
established
by
the
people
themselves
both
are
the
fundamental
law
of
the
land
a
the
distinction
is
admirably
expressed
but
in
history
it
is
not
always
easy
to
make
it
magna
charta
was
in
form
a
grant
by
the
sovereign
but
it
was
really
drawn
up
by
the
barons
who
in
a
certain
sense
represented
the
english
people
and
established
by
the
people
after
a
long
struggle
which
was
only
in
its
first
stages
in
john
time
to
some
extent
it
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
written
constitution

fled
from

on
january
parliament
declared
the

vacant
parliament
then
drew
up
the

a
document
very
similar
in
purport
to
the
first
eight
amendments
to
our
federal

and
on
the
of
february
the
two
houses
offered
the
crown
to
william

mary
on
condition
of
their
accepting
this
declaration
of
the
true
ancient
and
indubitable
rights
of
the
people
of
this
realm
the
crown
having
been
accepted
on
these
terms
parliament
in
the
following
december
enacted
the
famous
bill
of
rights
which
simply
put
their
previous
declaration
into
the
form
of
a
declaratory
statute
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
even
in
form
a
grant
from
a
sovereign
it
was
an
instrument
framed
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
without
promising
to
respect
it
william

mary
could
no
more
have
mounted
the

than
a

could
be
inducted
into
office
if
he
were
to
refuse
to
take
the
prescribed
oath
of

the

the
age
when
the

was
especially
notable
in

for
two
things
one
was
the
rapid
growth
of
modern

occupations
and
habits
the
other
was
the
temporary
overthrow
of
monarchy
soon
followed
by
the
final
subjection
of
the
crown
to
parliament
accordingly
the
sphere
of
contract
and
the
sphere
of
popular
sovereignty
were
enlarged
in
men
minds
and
the
notion
of
a
written
constitution
first
began
to
find
expression

which
in

protectorate
of
oliver
cromwell
was
substantially
a
written
constitution
but
it
emanated
from
a
questionable
authority
and
was
not
ratified
it
was
drawn
up
by
a
council
of
army
officers
and
it
broke
down
because
the
first
parliament
summoned
under
it
refused
to
acknowledge
its
binding
force
the
dissolution
of
this
parliament
accordingly
left
oliver
absolute

in
when
it
seemed
so
necessary
to
decide
what
sort
of

the
dictatorship
of
cromwell
was
to
prepare

proposed

his
case
showed
that
he
had
in
him
a
prophetic
foreshadowing
of
the
american
idea
as
it
was
realized
in
but
vane
ideas
were
too
far
in
advance
of
his
age
to
be
realized
then
in
england
older
ideas
to
which
men
were
more
accustomed
determined
the
course
of
events
there
and
it
was
left
for
americans
to
create
a
government
by
means
of
a
written
constitution
and
when
american
statesmen
did
so
they
did
it
without
any

they

not

directly
in

before
the

they
subscribed

such

on

all

a

extent
the
purposes
of
a

they
limited
the
legislative
powers
of
the
colonial
assemblies
the
question
sometimes
came
up
as
to
whether
some
statute
made
by
the
assembly
was
not
in
excess
of
the
powers
conferred
by
the

this
question
usually
arose
in

with
some
particular
law
case
and
thus
came
before
the
courts
for
settlement
first
before
the
courts
of
the

afterwards
it
might
sometimes
be
carried
on
appeal
before
the
privy

the
court
decided
that
the
statute
was
in

was
thereby
annulled

legislature
therefore
was
not
a
supreme
body
even
within

authority
was
restricted
by
the
terms

charter
thus
the
americans
for
more
than
a
century
before
the
revolution
were
familiarized
with
the
idea
of
a
legislature
as
a
representative
body
acting
within
certain
limits
prescribed
by
a
written
document
they
had
no
knowledge
or

of
a
supreme
legislative

as
the

has
become
since
the
founders
of
american
states
left
england
at
the
time
of
the

when
the
several
states
framed
new
governments
they
simply
put

into
the
position
of
supremacy
formerly
occupied
by
the
charter
instead
of
a
document
expressed
in
terms
of
a
royal
grant
they
adopted
a
document
expressed
in
terms
of
a
popular
edict
to
this
the
legislature
must
conform

people
were
already
somewhat
familiar
with
the
method
of
testing
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
by
getting
the
matter
brought
before
the
courts
the
mental
habit
thus
generated
was
probably
more
important
than
any
other
single
circumstance

before

this

we
may
observe
that
american
state
constitutions
have
altered
very
much
in
character
since
the
first
part
of
the
present
century
the
earlier
constitutions
were
confined
to
a

outline
of
the
organization
of
the
government
they
did
not
undertake
to
make
the
laws
but
to
prescribe
the
conditions
under
which
laws
might
be
made
and
executed
recent
state
constitutions
enter
more
and
more
boldly
upon
the
general
work
of
legislation
for
example
in
some
states
they
specify
what
kinds
of
property
shall
be
exempt
from
seizure
for
debt
they
make
regulations
as
to
railroad
they
prescribe
sundry
details
of
practice
in
the
courts
or
they
forbid
the
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
until
recently
such
subjects
would
have
been
left
to
the
legislatures
no
one
would
have
thought
of
putting
them
into
a
constitution
the
motive
in
so
doing
is
a
wish
to
put
certain
laws
into
such
a
shape
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
repeal
them
what
a
legislature
sees
fit
to
enact
this
year
it
may
see
fit
to
repeal
next
year
but
amending
a
state
constitution
is
a
slow
and
cumbrous
process
an
amendment
may
be
originated
in
the
legislature
where
it
must
secure
more
than
a
mere
majority
perhaps
a
three
fifths
or
two
thirds
vote
in
order
to
pass
in
some
states
it
must
be
adopted
by
two
successive
legislatures
perhaps
by
two
thirds
of
one
and
three
fourths
of
the
next
in
some
states
not
more
than
one
amendment
can
be
brought
before
the
same
legislature
in
some
it
is
provided
that
amendments
must
not
be
submitted
to
the
people
oftener
than
once
in
five
years
and
so
on
after
the
amendment
has
at
length
made
its
way
through
the
legislature
it
must
be
ratified
by
a
vote
of
the
people
at
the
next
general
election
another
way
to
get
a
constitution
amended
is
to
call
a
convention
for
that
purpose
in
order
to
call
a
convention
it
is
usually
necessary
to
obtain
a
two
thirds
vote
in
the
legislature
but
in
some
states
the
legislature
is
required
at
stated
intervals
to
submit
to
the
people
the
question
of
holding
such
a
convention
as
in
new
hampshire
every
seven
years
in
iowa
every
ten
years
in
michigan
every
sixteen
years
in
new
york
ohio
maryland
and
virginia
every
twenty

a
convention
is
a
representative
body
elected
by
the
people
to
meet
at
some
specified
time
and
place
for
some
specified
purpose
and
its
existence
ends
with
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose
it
is
in
this
occasional
character
that
the
convention
differs
from
an
ordinary
legislative
assembly
with
such
elaborate
checks
against
hasty
action
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
if
a
law
can
be
once
embodied
in
a
state
constitution
it
will
be
likely
to
have
some
permanence
moreover
a
direct
vote
by
the
people
gives
a
weightier
sanction
to
a
law
than
a
vote
in
the
legislature
there
is
also
no
doubt
a
disposition
to
distrust
legislatures
and
in
some
measure
do
their
work
for
them
by
direct
popular
enactment
for
such
reasons
some
recent
state
constitutions
have
come
almost
to
resemble
bodies
of
statutes
woodrow
wilson
suggestively
compares
this
kind
of
popular
legislation
with
the
swiss
practice
known
as
the
in
most
of
the
swiss
cantons
an
important
act
of
the
legislature
does
not
acquire
the
force
of
law
until
it
has
been
to
the
people
and
voted
on
by
them
the
objections
to
the
says
wilson
are
of
course
that
it
assumes
a
discriminating
judgment
and
a
fullness
of
information
on
the
part
of
the
people
touching
questions
of
public
policy
which
they
do
not
often
possess
and
that
it
lowers
the
sense
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
legislators
another
serious
objection
to
our
recent
practice
is
that
it
tends
to
confuse
the
very
valuable
distinction
between
a
constitution
and
a
body
of
statutes
to
necessitate
a
frequent
revision
of
constitutions
and
to
increase
the
cumbrousness
of
it
would
however
be
premature
at
the
present
time
to
pronounce
confidently
upon
a
practice
of
such
recent
origin
it
is
clear
that
its
tendency
is
extremely
democratic
and
that
it
implies
a
high
standard
of
general
intelligence
and
independence
among
the
people
if
the
evils
of
the
practice
are
found
to
outweigh
its
benefits
it
will
doubtless
fall
into
disfavour

are
prepared
to

how
by
means
of
such
a
document
the

of
our
federal

was
called
into
existence
we
have
already
described
so
much
of
the

in
operation
in

that
this

can

more
concise

if

had
started
at
the

instead

the
general
theory
of

has
already
been
set
before
the
reader
we
have
now
to
observe
in
conclusion
what
a
magnificent
piece
of
constructive
work
has
been
performed
in
accordance
with
that
general
theory
we
have
to
observe
the
building

a
vast

sidenote

in
all

there
was
always
one
important
circumstance
in
favour
of
the
union
of
the
thirteen
american
colonies
into
a
federal
nation
the
inhabitants
were
all
substantially
one
people
it
is
true
that
in
some
of
the
colonies
there
were
a
good
many
persons
not
of
english
ancestry
but
the
english
type
absorbed
and
assimilated
everything
else
all
spoke
the
english
language
all
had
english

except
the
development
of
the
written
constitution
every
bit
of
civil
government
described
in
the
preceding
pages
came
to
america
directly
from
england
and
not
a
bit
of
it
from
any
other
country
unless
by
being
first
filtered
through
england
our
institutions
were
as
english
as
our
speech
it
was
therefore
comparatively
easy
for
people
in
one
colony
to
understand
people
in
another
not
only
as
to
their
words
but
as
to
their
political
ideas
moreover
during
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
common
danger
from
the
aggressive
french
enemy
on
the
north
and
west
went
far
toward
awakening
in
the
thirteen
colonies
a
common
interest
and
after
the
french
enemy
had
been
removed
the
assertion
by
parliament
of
its
alleged
right
to
tax
the
americans
threatened
all
the
thirteen
legislatures
at
once
and
thus
in
fact
drove
the

course
it
was
nothing

the
sort
it
was
a
diplomatic
body
composed
of
delegates
representing
state

like
european
congresses
like
the
congress
of

for
example
which
tried
to
adjust
the

question
in
eleven

after

upon

committees
of
correspondence
nine
years
elapsed
without
another
congress
meanwhile
the
political
excitement
with
occasional
lulls
went
on
increasing
and
some
sort
of
cooperation
between
the
colonial
governments
became
habitual
in
after
parliament
had
passed
the
townshend
revenue
acts
there
was
no
congress
but
massachusetts
sent
a
circular
letter
to
the
other
colonies
inviting
them
to
cooperate
in
measures
of
resistance
and
the
other
colonies
responded
favourably
in
as
we
have
seen
committees
of
correspondence
between
the
towns
of
massachusetts
acted
as
a
sort
of
provisional
government
for
the
commonwealth
in
dabney
carr
of
virginia
enlarged
upon
this
idea
and
committees
of
correspondence
were
forthwith
instituted
between
the
several
colonies
thus
the
habit
of
acting
in
concert
began
to
be
formed
in
after
parliament
had
passed
an
act
overthrowing
the
government
of
massachusetts
along
with
other
offensive
measures
a
congress
assembled
in
september
at
philadelphia
the
city
most
centrally
situated
as
well
as
the
largest
if
the
remonstrances
adopted
at
this
congress
had
been
heeded
by
the
british
government
and
peace
had
followed
this
congress
would
probably
have
been
as
temporary
an
affair
as
its
predecessors
people
would
probably
have
waited
until
overtaken
by
some
other
emergency
but
inasmuch
as
war
followed
the
congress
assembled
again
in
may
and
thereafter
became
practically
a
permanent
institution
until
it
died
of

sidenote
continental
congress
this
congress
was
called
continental
to
distinguish
it
from
the
provincial
congresses
held
in
several
of
the
colonies
at
about
the
same
time
the
thirteen
colonies
were
indeed
but
a
narrow
strip
on
the
edge
of
a
vast
and
in
large
part
unexplored
continent
but
the
word
continental
was
convenient
for
distinguishing
between
the
whole
confederacy
and
its
several
members
sidenote
the
several
states
were
never
at
any
time
sovereign
states
sidenote
the
articles
of
confederation
the
continental
congress
began
to
exercise
a
certain
amount
of
directive
authority
from
the
time
of
its
first
meeting
in
such
authority
as
it
had
arose
simply
from
the
fact
that
it
represented
an
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
several
governments
to
pursue
a
certain
line
of
policy
it
was
a
diplomatic
and
executive
but
scarcely
yet
a
legislative
body
nevertheless
it
was
the
visible
symbol
of
a
kind
of
union
between
the
states
there
never
was
a
time
when
any
one
of
the
original
states
exercised
singly
the
full
powers
of
sovereignty
not
one
of
them
was
ever
a
small
sovereign
state
like
denmark
or
portugal
as
they
acted
together
under
the
common
direction
of
the
british
government
in
the
year
of
quebec
so
they
acted
together
under
the
common
direction
of
that
revolutionary
body
the
continental
congress
in
the
year
of
bunker
hill
in
that
year
a
continental
army
was
organized
in
the
name
of
the
united
colonies
in
the
following
year
when
independence
was
declared
it
was
done
by
the
concerted
action
of
all
the
colonies
and
at
the
same
time
a
committee
was
appointed
by
congress
to
draw
up
a
written
constitution
this
constitution
known
as
the
articles
or
confederation
was
submitted
to
congress
in
the
autumn
of
and
was
sent
to
the
several
states
to
be
ratified
a
unanimous
ratification
was
necessary
and
it
was
not
until
march
that
unanimity
was
secured
and
the
articles
adopted
meanwhile
the
revolutionary
war
had
advanced
into
its
last
stages
having
been
carried
on
from
the
outset
under
the
general
direction
of
the
continental
congress
when
reading
about
this
period
of
our
history
the
student
must
be
careful
not
to
be
misled
by
the
name
congress
into
reasoning
as
if
there
were
any
resemblance
whatever
between
that
body
and
the
congress
which
was
created
by
our
federal
constitution
the
continental
congress
was
not
the
parent
of
our
federal
congress
the
former
died
without
offspring
and
the
latter
had
a
very
different
origin
as
we
shall
soon
see
the
former
simply
bequeathed
to
the
latter
a
name
that
was
all
sidenote
nature
and
powers
of
the
continental
congress
the
continental
congress
was
an
assembly
of
delegates
from
the
thirteen
states
which
from
to
held
its
sessions
at
philadelphia
it
owned
no
federal
property
not
even
the
house
in
which
it
assembled
and
after
it
had
been
turned
out
of
doors
by
a
mob
of
drunken
soldiers
in
june
it
flitted
about
from
place
to
place
sitting
now
at
trenton
now
at
annapolis
and
finally
at
new
york
each
state
sent
to
it
as
many
delegates
as
it
chose
though
after
the
adoption
of
the
articles
no
state
could
send
less
than
two
or
more
than
seven
each
state
had
one
vote
and
it
took
nine
votes
or
two
thirds
of
the
whole
to
carry
any
measure
of
importance
one
of
the
delegates
was
chosen
president
or
chairman
of
the
congress
and
this
position
was
one
of
great
dignity
and
considerable
influence
but
it
was
not
essentially
different
from
the
position
of
any
of
the
other
delegates
there
were
no
distinct
executive
officers
important
executive
matters
were
at
first
assigned
to
committees
such
as
the
finance
committee
and
the
board
of
war
though
at
the
most
trying
time
the
finance
committee
was
a
committee
of
one
in
the
person
of
robert
morris
who
was
commonly
called
the
financier
the
work
of
the
finance
committee
was
chiefly
trying
to
solve
the
problem
of
paying
bills
without
spending
money
for
there
was
seldom
any
money
to
spend
congress
could
not
tax
the
people
or
recruit
the
army
when
it
wanted
money
or
troops
it
could
only
ask
the
state
governments
for
them
and
generally
it
got
from
a
fifth
to
a
fourth
part
of
the
troops
needed
but
of
money
a
far
smaller
proportion
sometimes
it
borrowed
money
from
holland
or
france
but
often
its
only
resource
was
to
issue
paper
promises
to
pay
or
the
continental
paper
money
there
were
no
federal
courts
nor
marshals
to
execute
federal
decrees
congress
might
issue
orders
but
it
had
no
means
of
compelling
obedience

it

the

was
therefore
not

is
not

a
government
until
it
can
impose
taxes

thus
command
the

needful

nevertheless
the

exercised
some
of
the
most
indisputable
functions

declared
the
independence
of
the

ratified
a

was
really
in

respects

in
the
eyes
of
the
world
at
large
a
sovereign
body

soon
showed
that
the
continued
exercise
of

was
not
compatible
with
the
absence
of
the

was
an
illogical

constructing

was
removed
the
weakness
of
the

was
shown
in
many
ways
that
were
alarming
the
of
union
was
weak
in
spite
of
the
community
in
language
and
institutions
which
was
so
favourable
to
union
the
people
of
the
several
states
had
many
local
prejudices
which
tended
to
destroy
the
union
in
its
infancy
a
man
was
quicker
to
remember
that
he
was
a

or
a

that

autumn
of
when
the

was
quite
bankrupt
and
most
of
the

nearly
so
when
threats
of
secession
were
heard
both
in

and
in
the
south
when
there
were

in

by

it
came
to
be
thought
necessary
to
make
some
kind
of
a
change
sidenote
the
federal
convention
men
were
most
unwillingly
brought
to
this
conclusion
because
they
were
used
to
their
state
assemblies
and
not
afraid
of
them
but
they
were
afraid
of
increasing
the
powers
of
any
government
superior
to
the
states
lest
they
should
thus
create
an
unmanageable
tyranny
they
believed
that
even
anarchy
though
a
dreadful
evil
is
not
so
dreadful
as
despotism
and
for
this
view
there
is
much
to
be
said
after
no
end
of
trouble
a
convention
was
at
length
got
together
at
philadelphia
in
may
and
after
four
months
of
work
with
closed
doors
it
was
able
to
offer
to
the
country
the
new
federal
constitution
both
in
its
character
and
in
the
work
which
it
did
this
federal
convention
over
which
washington
presided
and
of
which
franklin
madison
and
hamilton
were
members
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
deliberative
bodies
known
to
history
we
have
seen
that
the
fundamental
weakness
of
the
continental
congress
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
could
not
tax
the
people
hence
although
it
could
for
a
time
exert
other
high
functions
of
sovereignty
it
could
only
do
so
while
money
was
supplied
to
it
from
other
sources
than
taxation
from
contributions
made
by
the
states
in
answer
to
its
requisitions
from
foreign
loans
and
from
a
paper
currency
but
such
resources
could
not
last
long
it
was
like
a
man
trying
to
live
upon
his
own
promissory
notes
and
upon
gifts
and
unsecured
loans
from
his
friends
when
the
supply
of
money
was
exhausted
the
congress
soon
found
that
it
could
no
longer
comport
itself
as
a
sovereign
power
it
could
not
preserve
order
at
home
and
the
situation
abroad
may
be
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
george
iii
kept
garrisons
in
several
of
our
northwestern
frontier
towns
and
would
not
send
a
minister
to
the
united
states
this
example
shows
that
among
the
sovereign
powers
of
a
government
the
power
of
taxation
is
the
fundamental
one
upon
which
all
the
others
depend
nothing
can
go
on
without
money
but
the
people
of
the
several
states
would
never
consent
to
grant
the
power
of
taxation
to
such
a
body
as
the
continental
congress
in
which
they
were
not
represented
the
congress
was
not
a
legislature
but
a
diplomatic
body
it
did
not
represent
the
people
but
the
state
governments
and
a
large
state
like
pennsylvania
had
no
more
weight
in
it
than
a
little
state
like
delaware
if
there
was
to
be
any
central
assembly
for
the
whole
union
endowed
with
the
power
of
taxation
it
must
be
an
assembly
representing
the
american
people
just
as
the
assembly
of
a
single
state
represented
the
people
of
the
state
as
soon
as
this
point
became
clear
it
was
seen
to
be
necessary
to
throw
the
articles

according

rule
that
is

at
this
point
a
difficulty
arose
in
the

as
to
whether
slaves
should
be
counted
as
population
if
they
were
to
be
counted
the
relative
weight
of

would
be
much
increased
the
northern
states
thought
with
reason
that
it
would
be
unduly
increased
the
difficulty
was
adjusted
by
a
compromise
according
to
which
five
slaves
were
to
be
reckoned
as
three
persons
since
the
abolition
of

this
provision
has
become
obsolete

until
it
was
a
very
important
factor
in
american
history

footnote
see
my
pp
sidenote
the
connecticut
compromise
this
feature
of
the
house
of
representatives
caused
the
smaller
states
in
the
convention
to
oppose
the
whole
scheme
of
constructing
a
new
government
they
were
determined
that
great
and
small
states
should
have
equal
weight
in
congress
their
steadfast
opposition
threatened
to
ruin
everything
when
fortunately
a
method
of
compromise
was
discovered
it
was
intended
that
the
national
legislature
in
imitation
of
the
state
legislatures
should
have
an
upper
house
or
senate
and
at
first
the
advocates
of
a
strong
national
government
proposed
that
the
senate
also
should
represent
population
thus
differing
from
the
lower
house
only
in
the
way
in
which
we
have
seen
that
it
generally
differed
in
the
several
states
but
it
happened
that
in
the
state
of
connecticut
the
custom
was
peculiar
there
it
had
always
been
the
custom
to
elect
the
governor
and
upper
house
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
whole
people
while
for
each
township
there
was
an
equality
of
representation
in
the
lower
house
the
connecticut
delegates
in
the
convention
therefore
being
familiar
with
a
legislature
in
which
the
two
houses
were
composed
on
different
principles
suggested
a
compromise
let
the
house
of
representatives
they
said
represent
the
people
and
let
the
senate
represent
the
states
let
all
the
states
great
and
small
be
represented
equally
in
the
federal
senate
such
was
the
famous
connecticut
compromise
without
it
the
convention
would
probably
have
broken
up
without
accomplishing
anything
when
it
was
adopted
half
the
work
of
making
the
new
government
was
done
for
the
small
states
having
had
their
fears
thus
allayed
by
the
assurance
that
they
were
to
be
equally
represented
in
the
senate
no
longer
opposed
the
work
but
cooperated
in
it
most
zealously
sidenote
the
senate
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
upper
house
of
our
national
legislature
is
composed
of
two
senators
from
each
state
as
they
represent
the
state
they
are
chosen
by
its
legislature
and
not
by
the
people
but
when
they
have
taken
their
seats
in
the
senate
they
do
not
vote
by
states
like
the
delegates
in
the
continental
congress
on
the
contrary
each
senator
has
one
vote
and
the
two
senators
from
the
same
state
may
and
often
do
vote
on
opposite
sides
in
accordance
with
the
notion
that
an
upper
house
should
be
somewhat
less
democratic
than
a
lower
house
the
term
of
office
for
senators
was
made
longer
than
for
representatives
the
tendency
is
to
make
the
senate
respond
more
slowly
to
changes
in
popular
sentiment
and
this
is
often
an
advantage
popular
opinion
is
often
very
wrong
at
particular
moments
but
with
time
it
is
apt
to
correct
its
mistakes
we
are
usually
in
more
danger
of
suffering
from
hasty
legislation
than
from
tardy
legislation
senators
are
chosen
for
a
term
of
six
years
and
one
third
of
the
number
of
terms
expire
every
second
year
so
that
while
the
whole
senate
may
be
renewed
by
the
lapse
of
six
years
there
is
never
a
new
senate
the
senate
has
thus
a
continuous
existence
and
a
permanent
organization
whereas
each
house
of
representatives
expires
at
the
end
of
its
two
years
term
and
is
succeeded
by
a
new
house
which
requires
to
be
organized
by
electing
its
officers
before
proceeding
to
business
a
candidate
for
the
senatorship
must
have
reached
the
age
of
thirty

have

nine
years

holding

representatives

its
own

but
it
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
alter
such
regulations
except
as
to
the
place
of
choosing
senators
here
we
see
a
vestige
of
the
original
theory

to
which
the

the
number
of

the

is
entitled
to
send

these
electoral

are
marked

the
division
is
apt
to
be
made
by
the
preponderating
party
with
an
unfairness
that
is
at
once
shameful
and
ridiculous
the
aim
of
course
is
so
to
lay
out
the
districts
as
to
secure
in
the
greatest
possible
number
of
them
a
majority
for
the
party
which
conducts
the
operation
this
is
done
sometimes
by
throwing
the
greatest
possible
number
of
hostile
voters
into
a
district
which
is
anyhow
certain
to
be
hostile
sometimes
by
adding
to
a

where

are
equally

years
afterward

gerry
was
governor
of

state
the
republican
legislature
redistributed
the
districts
in
such
wise
that
the
shapes
of
the
towns
forming
a
single
district
in
essex
county
gave
to
the

a
somewhat
contour
this
was
indicated
upon
a

of
massachusetts

benjamin

ardent
federalist

of

hung
up
over

celebrated

coming
into

observing
the

added
with

a

exclaimed
that

duly
coined

at

after

the

at

where
the

had
the

there
was
some
delay
in
the
redistribution
congress
allowed
the
state
in
to
elect
all
its
representatives
upon
a
general
ticket
the
advantage
of
the
district
system
is
that
the
candidates
are
likely
to
be
better
known
by
neighbours
but
the
election
at
large
is
perhaps
more
likely
to
secure
able
men
it
is
the
american
custom
to
nominate
only
residents
of
the
district
as
candidates
for
the
house
of
representatives
a
citizen
of
albany
for
example
would
not
be
nominated
for
the
district
in
which
buffalo
is
situated
in
the
british
practice
on
the
other
hand
if
an
eminent
man
can
not
get
a
nomination
in
his
own
county
or
borough
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
his
standing
for
any
other
county
or
borough
this
system
seems
more
favourable
to
the
independence
of
the
legislator
than
our
system
some
of
its
advantages
are
obtained
by
the
election

congress
can
if
worth

enact

following
that
date
unless
the
new

should
at
some
earlier
moment
summon

it
thus
happens
that
ordinarily
the
representatives
of
the
nation
do
not
meet
for
more
than
a

as

business
is
at

the

impeachment
in
england
the
provisions
for
impeachment
of
public
officers
are
copied
from
the
custom
in
england
since
the
fourteenth
century
the
house
of
commons
has
occasionally
exercised
the
power
of
impeaching
the
ministers
and
other
high
public
officers
and
although
the
power
was
not
used
during
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
afterward
revived
and
conclusively
established
in
it
was
enacted
that
the
royal
pardon
could
not
be
pleaded
against
an
impeachment
and
this
act
finally
secured
the
responsibility
of
the
king
ministers
to
parliament
an
impeachment
is
a
kind
of
accusation
or
indictment
brought
against
a
public
officer
by
the
house
of
commons
the
court
in
which
the
case
is
tried
is
the
house
of
lords
and
the
ordinary
rules
of
judicial
procedure
are
followed
the
regular
president
of
the
house
of
lords
is
the
lord
chancellor
who
is
the
highest
judicial
officer
in
the
kingdom
a
simple
majority
vote
secures
conviction
and
then
it
is
left
for
the
house
of

to
say
whether

shall
be
pronounced

not

against
the

for

purposes
a

is
required

this
precaution
proved
effectual
fortunately
as
most
persons
now
admit
in
the
famous
case
of

johnson
in
in

of
conviction
the
judgment
can
not
extend
further
than
to
removal
from

the
provisions
of
the

simple

bills
for
raising
revenue
must
originate
in
the
lower
house
but
the
upper
house
may
propose
or
concur
with
amendments
as
on
other
bills
this
provision
was
inherited
from
parliament
through
the
colonial
legislatures
after
a
bill
has
passed
both
houses
it
must
be
sent
to
the
president
for
approval
if
he
approves
it
he
signs
it
if
not
he
returns
it
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
a
written
statement
of
his
objections
and
this
statement
must
be
entered
in
full
upon
the
journal
of
the
house
the
bill
is
then
reconsidered
and
if
it
obtains
a
two
thirds
vote
it
is
sent
together
with
the
objections
to
the
other
house
if
it
there
likewise
obtains
a
two
thirds
vote
it
becomes
a
law
in
spite
of
the
objections
otherwise
it
fails
if
the
president
keeps
a
bill
longer
than
ten
days
sundays
excepted
without
signing
it
it
becomes
a
law
without
his
signature
unless
congress
adjourns
before
the
expiration
of
the
ten
days
in
which
case
it
fails
to
become
a

as
if
it
had
been
vetoed
this

of
vetoing
a
bill
just
before
the
expiration
of
a
congress
by
keeping
it
in

to
speak
was
dubbed

was

employed
by

jackson
in
the

power
is
a
qualified
form
of
that
which
formerly
belonged
to
the
english
sovereign
but
has
now
as
already
observed
become
practically
obsolete
as
a
means
of
guarding
the
country
against
unwise
legislation
it
has
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
features
of
our
federal
constitution
in
bad
hands
it
can
not
do
much
harm
it
can
only
delay
for
a
short
time
a
needed
law
but
when
properly
used
it
can
save
the
country
from
laws
that
if
once
enacted
would
sow
seeds
of
disaster
very
hard
to
eradicate
and
it
has
repeatedly
done
so
a
single
man
will
often
act
intelligently
where
a
group
of
men
act
foolishly

a

would
choose
eight

eight
congressional

there
were
various
ways
of
choosing
the

one
party
would
have
a

so
the
electoral

state
would
be
divided
between
two
pairs

it
became
customary
to
choose
the

upon

thus
the

became
solid

of
the
most
distinctive
features
of
civil
government
in
the
united
states
tends
to
prevent
the
development
of
leadership
an
english
prime
minister
policy
so
long
as
he
remains
in
office
must
be
that
of
the
house
of
commons
power
and
responsibility
are
concentrated
an
able
president
may
virtually
direct
the
policy
of
his
party
in
congress
but
he
often
has
a
majority
against
him
in
one
house
and
sometimes
in
both
at
once
thus
in
dividing
power
we
divide
and
weaken
responsibility
to
this
point
i
have
already
alluded
as
illustrated
in
our
state
governments
footnote
the
english
method
however
would
probably
not
work
well
in
this
country
and
might
prove
to
be
a
source
of
great
and
complicated
dangers

executive

sidenote
the
cabinet
the
constitution
made
no
specific
provisions
for
the
creation
of
executive
departments
but
left
the
matter
to
congress
at
the
beginning
of
washington
administration
three
secretaryships
were
created
those
of
state
treasury
and
war
and
an
was
appointed
afterward
the
department
of
the
navy
was
separated
from
that
of
war
the
was
made
a
member
of
the
administration
and
as
lately
as
the
department
of
the
interior
was
organized
the
heads
of
these
departments
are
the
advisers
but
they
have
as
a
body
no
recognized
legal
existence
or
authority
they
hold
their
meetings
in
a
room
at
the
executive
mansion
the
white
house
but
no
record
is
kept
of
their
proceedings
and
the
president
is
not
bound
to
heed
their
advice
this
body
has
always
been
called
the
cabinet
after
the
english
usage
it
is
like
the
english
cabinet
in
being
composed
of
heads
of
executive
departments
and
in
being
as
a
body
unknown
to
the
law
in
other
respects
the
difference
is
very
great
the
english
cabinet
is
the
executive
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
and
exercises
a
guiding
and
directing
influence
upon
legislation
the
position
of
the
president
is
not
at
all
like
that
of
the
prime
minister
it
is
more
like
that
of
the
english
sovereign
though
the
latter
has
not
nearly
so
much
power
as
the
president
and
the
american
cabinet
in
some
respects
resembles
the
english
privy
council
though
it
can
not
make
ordinances
sidenote
the
secretary
of
state
the
secretary
of
state
ranks
first
among
our
cabinet
officers
he
is
often
called
our
prime
minister
or
premier
but
there
could
not
be
a
more
absurd
use
of
language
in
order
to
make
an
american
personage
corresponding
to
the
english
prime
minister
we
must
first
go
to
the
house
of
representatives
take
its
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
its
committee
on
appropriations
and
unite
them
into
one
committee
of
finance
then
we
must
take
the
chairman
of
this
committee
give
him
the
power
of
dissolving
the
house
and
ordering
a
new
election
and
make
him
master
of
all
the
executive
departments
while
at
the
same
time
we
strip
from
the
president
all
real
control
over
the
administration
this
exalted
would
be
much
like
the
first
lord
of
the
treasury
commonly
called
the
prime
minister
this
illustration
shows
how
wide
the
divergence
has
become
between
our
system
and
that
of
great
britain
our
secretary
of
state
is
our
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
is
the
only
officer
who
is
authorized
to
communicate
with
other
governments
in
the
name
of
the
president
he
is
at
the
head
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
issuing
the
instructions
to
our
ministers
abroad
and
he
takes
a
leading
part
in
the
negotiation
of
treaties
to
these
ministerial
duties
he
adds
some
that
are
more
characteristic
of
his
title
of
secretary
he
keeps
the
national
archives
and
superintends
the
publication
of
laws
treaties
and
proclamations
and
he
is
the
keeper
of
the
great
seal
of
the
united
states
sidenote
diplomatic
and

our
foreign
relations
are
cared
for
in
foreign
countries
by
two
distinct
classes
of
officials
ministers
and
consuls
the
former
represent
the
united
states
government
in
a
diplomatic
capacity
the
latter
have
nothing
to
do
with
diplomacy
or
politics
but
look
after
our
commercial
interests
in
foreign
countries
consuls
exercise
a
protective
care
over
seamen
and
perform
various
duties
for
americans
abroad
they
can
take
testimony
and
administer
estates
in
some
countries
such
as
china
japan
and
turkey
they
have
jurisdiction
over
criminal
cases
in
which
americans
are
concerned
formerly
our
ministers
abroad
were
of
only
three
grades
envoys
extraordinary
and
ministers

ministers

the
first
two
are
accredited
by

of

affairs
in
the
countries
to
which
they
are
sent
we
still
retain
these
grades
which
correspond
to
the
lower
grades
of
the
diplomatic
service
in
european
countries
until
lately
we
had
no
highest
grade
answering
to
that
of
ambassador
perhaps
because
when
our
diplomatic
service
was
organized
the
united
states
did
not
yet
rank
among
powers
and
could
not
expect
to
receive
ambassadors
great
powers
like
france
and
germany
send
ambassadors
to
each
other
and
envoys
to
inferior
powers
like
denmark
or
greece
or
guatemala
when
we
send
envoys
to
the
great
powers
we
rank
ourselves
along
with
inferior
powers
and
diplomatic
etiquette
as
a
rule
obliges
the
great
powers
to
send
to
us
the
same
grade
of
minister
that
we
send
to
them
there
were
found
to
be
some
practical
inconveniences
about
this
so
that
in
the
highest
grade
was
adopted
and
our
ministers
to

were
made

the

retained
by

granted

have

is

passage
from
plural
to
singular
was
accomplished

it
took
some
people
a
good
while
to
realize
the
fact
the
german
language
has
a
neat
way

distinguishing

a
loose

calls
the

if

liked
we
might
call
the
confederation
a
and

are

points

in

constitution
which
transformed
our
country
from

into
a

the
paper
dollar
note
a
legal
tender
when
it
refuses
to
give
you
the
gold
dollar
and
makes
you
take
its

instead
the
note
soon
ceases
to
be
worth
a
dollar
you
would
rather
have
the
gold
than
the
note
for
the
mere
fact
that
government
refuses
to
give
the
gold
shows
that
it
is
in
financial
difficulties
so
the
note
value
is
sure
to
fall
and
if
the
government
is
in
serious
difficulty
it
falls
very
far
and
as
it
falls
it
takes
more
of
it
to
buy
things
prices
go
up
there
was
a
time
during
our
civil
war
when
a
paper
dollar
was
worth
only
forty
cents
and
a
barrel
of
flour
cost
but
that
was
nothing
to
the
year
when
the
paper
dollar
issued
by
the
continental
congress
was
worth
only
a
mill
and
flour
was
sold
in
boston
for
a
barrel
when
the
different
states
tried
to
make
paper
money
it
made
confusion
worse
confounded
for
the
states
refused
to
take
each
other
money
and
this
helped
to
lower
its
value
in
some
states
the
value
of
the
paper
dollar
fell
in
less
than
a
year
to
twelve
or
fifteen
cents
at
such
times
there
is
always
great
demoralization
and
suffering
especially
among
the
poorer
people
and
with
all
the
experience
of
the
past
to
teach
us
it
may
now
be
held
to
be
little
less
than
a
criminal
act
for
a
government
under
any
circumstances
to
make
its
paper
notes
a
legal
tender
the
excuse
for
the
continental
congress
was
that
it
was
not
completely
a
government
and
seemed
to
have
no
alternative
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
paper
currency
damaged
the
country
much
more
than
the
arms
of
the
enemy
by
land
or
sea
the
feeling
was
so
strong
about
it
in
the
federal
convention
that
the
prohibition
came
near
being
extended
to
the
national
government
but
the
question
was
unfortunately

few
words
about
sidenote
federal
taxation
a
chief
source
of
the
opposition
to
the
new
federal
government
was
the
dread
of
federal
taxation
people
who
found
it
hard
to
pay
their
town
county
and
state
taxes
felt
that
it
would
be
ruinous
to
have
to
pay
still
another
kind
of
tax
in
the
mere
fact
of
federal
taxation
therefore
they
were
inclined
to
see
tyranny
with
people
in
such
a
mood
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
cautiously
in
devising
measures
of
federal
taxation
sidenote
excise
this
was
well
understood
by
our
first
secretary
of
the
treasury
alexander
hamilton
and
in
the
course
of
his
administration
of
the
treasury
he
was
once
roughly
reminded
of
it
the
two
methods
of
federal
taxation
adopted
at
his
suggestion
were
duties
on
imports
and
excise
on
a
few
domestic
products
such
as
whiskey
and
tobacco
the
excise
being
a
tax
which
people
could
see
and
feel
was
very
unpopular
and
in
the
opposition
to
it
in
western
pennsylvania
grew
into
the
famous
whiskey
insurrection
against
which
president
washington
thought
it
prudent
to
send
an
army
of
men
this
formidable
display
of
federal
power
suppressed
the
insurrection
without
bloodshed
sidenote
tariff
nowhere
was
there
any
such
violent
opposition
to
hamilton
scheme
of
duties
on
imported
goods
people
had
always
been
familiar
with
such
duties
in
the
colonial
times
they
had
been
levied
by
the
british
government
without
calling
forth
resistance
until
charles
townshend
made
them
the
vehicle
of
a
dangerous
attack
upon
american
after
the
declaration
of
independence
duties
were
levied
by
the
state
governments
and
the
proceeds
were
paid
into
the
treasuries
of
the
several
states
before
much
trouble
had
arisen
from
oppressive
enacted
by
some
of
the
states
against
others
by
taking
away
from
the
states
the
power
of
taxing
imports
the
new
constitution
removed
this
source
of
irritation
it
became
possible
to
lighten
the
burden
of
duties
while
by
turning
the
full
stream
of
them
into
the
federal
treasury
an
abundant
national
revenue
was
secured
at
once
thus
this
part
of
hamilton
policy
met
with
general
approval
the
tariff
has
always
been
our
favourite
device
for
obtaining
a
national
revenue
during
our
civil
war
indeed
the
national
government
resorted
extensively
to
direct
taxation
chiefly
in
the
form
of
revenue
stamps
though
it
also
put
a
tax
upon
pianos
gold
watches
and
all
sorts
of
things
but
after
the
return
of
peace
these
unusual
taxes
were
one
after
another
discontinued
and
since
then
our
national
revenue
has
been
raised
as
in
hamilton
time
from
duties
on
imports
and
excise
on
a
few
domestic
products
chiefly
tobacco
and
distilled
liquors

under

the
american

have
at
most
times
been

led

to

measures
that
they
assumed
powers
in

national

which
were
not

hamilton
then
fell
back
upon
the
elastic
clause
of
the
constitution
and
maintained
that
such
powers
were
in
it
jefferson
held
that
this
doctrine
of
implied
powers
stretched
the
elastic
clause
too
far
he
held
that
the
elastic
clause
ought
to

hamilton
held
that

it
may
here
be
said
in
general
that
the
practical
questions
which
have
divided
the
two
great
parties
have
been
concerned
with
the
powers
of
the
national
government
as

the
the
making

the
democratic
party
achieved
a
complete
and
decisive
victory
under
president

on
the
question
of
internal
improvements
the
opposite
party
still
holds
the
ground
but
most
of
its
details
have
been
settled
by
the
great
development
of
the
powers
of
private
enterprise
during
the
past
sixty
years
and
it
is
not
at
present
a
burning
question
the
question
of
the
tariff
however
remains
as
a
burning
question
but
it
is
no
longer
argued
on
grounds
of
constitutional
law
but
on
grounds
of
political
economy
hamilton
construction
of
the
elastic
clause
has
to
this
extent
prevailed
and
mainly
for
the
reason
that
a
liberal
construction
of
that
clause
was
needed
in
order
to
give
the
national
government
enough
power
to
restrict
the
spread
of
slavery
and
suppress
the
great
rebellion
of
which
slavery
was
the
exciting
cause
sidenote
civil
service
reform
another
political
question
more
important
if
possible
than
that
of
the
tariff
is
the
question
of
the
reform
of
the
civil
service
but
it
is
not
avowedly
made
a
party
question
twenty
years
ago
both
parties
laughed
at
it
now
both
try
to
treat
it
with
a
show
of
respect
and
to
render
unto
it
and
the
control
of
the
immediate
political
future
probably
lies
with
the
party
which
treats
it
most
seriously
it
is
a
question
that
was
not
distinctly
foreseen
in
the
days
of
hamilton
and
jefferson
when
the
constitution
was
made
and
adopted
otherwise
one
is
inclined
to
believe
the
framers
of
the
constitution
would
have
had
something
to
say
about
it
the
question
as
to
the
civil
service
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
president
has
the
power
of
appointing
a
vast
number
of
petty
officials
chiefly
postmasters
and
officials
concerned
with
the
collection
of
the
federal
revenue
such
officials
have
properly
nothing
to
do
with
politics
they
are
simply
the
agents
or
clerks
or
servants
of
the
national
government
in
conducting
its
business
and
if
the
business
of
the
national
government
is
to
be
managed
on
such
ordinary
principles
of
prudence
as
prevail
in
the
management
of
private
business
such
servants
ought
to
be
selected
for
personal
merit
and
retained
for
life
or
during
good
behaviour
it
did
not
occur
to
our
earlier
presidents
to
regard
the
management
of
the
public
business
in
any
other
light
than
this
sidenote
origin
of
the
spoils
system
but
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
a
vicious
system
was
growing
up
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania
in
those
states
the
appointive
offices
came
to
be
used
as
bribes
or
as
rewards
for
partisan
services
by
securing
votes
for
a
successful
candidate
a
man
with
little
in
his
pocket
and
nothing
in
particular
to
do
could
obtain
some
office
with
a
comfortable
salary
it
would
be
given
him
as
a
reward
and
some
other
man
perhaps
more
competent
than
himself
would
have
to
be
turned
out
in
order
to
make
room
for
him
a
more
effective
method
of
driving
good
citizens
out
of
politics
could
hardly
be
devised
it
called
to
the
front
a
large
class
of
men
of
coarse
moral
fibre
who
greatly
preferred
the
excitement
of
speculating
in
politics
to
earning
an
honest
living
by
some
ordinary
humdrum
business
the
civil
service
of
these
states
was
seriously
damaged
in
quality

degenerated
into
a
wild
scramble
for
offices
salaries
were
paid
to
men
who
did
little
or
no
public

thus

line
which
separates

something

meritorious
about

were
regarded
as
plums
at
which
every
one
ought
to
be
allowed

chance

take
a
bite

way
was
prepared
in
by
crawford
of
georgia
who
succeeded
in
getting
the
law
enacted
that
limits
the
tenure
of
office
for
postmasters
revenue
collectors
and
other
servants
of
the
federal
government
to
four
years
the
importance
of
this
measure
was
not
understood
and
it
excited
very
little
discussion
at
the
time
the
next
presidential
election
which
resulted
in
a
change
of
party
was
that
of
jackson
in
and
then
the
methods
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
were
applied
on
a
national
scale
jackson
cherished
the
absurd
belief
that
the
administration
of
his
predecessor
adams
had
been
corrupt
and
he
turned
men
out
of
office
with
a
keen
zest

the
forty
years
between
washington
first
inauguration
and
jackson

total
number
of
removals
from
office
was
and

of
this
number
were
defaulters
during
the
first
year
of
jackson
administration
the
number
of
changes
made
in
the
civil
service
was
about
such
was
the
abrupt
inauguration
upon
a
national
scale
of
the
spoils
system
the
phrase
originated
with
marcy
of
new
york
who
in
a
speech
in
the
senate
in
declared
that
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
the
man
who
said
this
of
course
did
not
realize
that
he
was
making
one
of
the
most
shameful
remarks
recorded
in
history
there
was
however
much
aptness
in
his
phrase
inasmuch
as
it
was
a
confession
that
the
business
of
american
politics
was
about
to
be
conducted
on
principles
fit
only
for
the
warfare

merit
of

in
its
removal

sidenote
the
australian
another
political
reform
which
promises
excellent
results
is
the
adoption
by
many
states
of
some
form
of
the
australian
for
the
purpose
of
checking
intimidation
and
bribery
at
elections
the
ballots
are
printed
by
the
state
and
contain
the
names
of
all
the
candidates
of
all
the
parties
against
the
name
of
each
candidate
the
party
to
which
he
belongs
is
designated
and
against
each
name
there
is
a
small
vacant
space
to
be
filled
with
a
cross
at
the
the
ballots
are
kept
in
an
inclosure
behind
a
railing
and
no
ballot
can
be
brought
outside
under
penalty
of
fine
or
imprisonment
one
ballot
is
nailed
against
the
wall
outside
the
railing
so
that
it
may
be
read
at
leisure
the
space
behind
the
railing
is
divided
into
separate
booths
quite
screened
from
each
other
each
booth
is
provided
with
a
pencil
and
a
convenient
shelf
on
which
to
write
the
voter
goes
behind
the
railing
takes
the
ballot
which
is
handed
him
carries
it
into
one
of
the
booths
and
marks
a
cross
against
the
names
of
the
candidates
for
whom
he
votes
he
then
puts
his
ballot
into
the
box
and
his
name
is
checked
off
on
the
register
of
voters
of
the
precinct
this
system
is
very
simple
it
enables
a
vote
to
be
given
in
absolute
secrecy
and
it
keeps
heelers
away
from
the
polls
it
is
favourable
to
independence
in
voting
and
it
is
unfavourable
to
bribery
because
unless
the
briber
can
follow
his
man
to
the
polls
and
see
how
he
votes
he
can
not
be
sure
that
his
bribe
is
effective
to
make
the
precautions
against
bribery
complete
it
will
doubtless
be
necessary
to
add
to
the
secret
ballot
the
english
system
of
accounting
for
election
expenses
all
the
funds
used
in
an
election
must
pass
through
the
hands
of
a
small
local
committee
vouchers
must
be
received
for
every
penny
that
is
expended
and
after
the
election
an
itemized
account
must
be
made
out
and
its
accuracy
attested
under
oath
before
a
notary
public
this
system
of
accounting
has
put
an
end
to
bribery
in
england
footnote
this
is
a
brief
description
of
the
system
lately
adopted
in
massachusetts
the
penalty
here
mentioned
is
a
fine
not
exceeding
a
thousand
dollars
or
imprisonment
not
exceeding
one
year
or
both
such
fine
and
such
imprisonment
footnote
it
is
especially
favourable
to
independence
in
voting
if
the
lists
of
the
candidates
are
placed
in
a
single
column
without
reference
to
party
each
name
of
course
having
the
proper
party
designation
attached
to
it
in
such
case
it
must
necessarily
take
the
voter
some
little
time
to
find
and
mark
each
name
for
which
he
wishes
to
vote
if
however
the
names
of
the
candidates
are
arranged
according
to
their
party
all
the
republicans
in
one
list
all
the
democrats
in
another
this
arrangement
is
much
less
favourable
to
independence
in
voting
and
much
less
efficient
as
a
check
upon
bribery
because
the
man
who
votes
a
straight
party
ticket
will
make
all
his
marks
in
a
very
short
time
while
the
scratcher
or
independent
voter
will
consume
much
more
time
in
selecting
his
names
thus
people
interested
in
seeing
whether
a
man
is
voting
the
straight
party
ticket
or
not
can
form
an
opinion
from
the
length
of
time
he
spends
in
the
booth
it
is
therefore
important
that
the
names
of
all
candidates
should
be
printed
in
a
single
column

important
step
in
this
direction
has
been
taken
in

complaints
of

have
attracted
especial
attention
in

it
is
highly
creditable
to
the
good
sense
of
the
people
that
measures
of
prevention
have
been
so
promptly
adopted
by
so
many
states
with

independent

uncorrupted

the

taken

franklin
speech
on
the
last
day
of
the
constitutional
convention
footnote
from
madison
in
eliot
vol
p
monday
the
engrossed
constitution
being
read
doctor
franklin
rose
with
a
speech
in
his
hand
which
he
had
reduced
to
writing
for
his
own
convenience
and
which
wilson
read
in
the
words
following
president
i
confess
that
there
are
several
parts
of
this
constitution
which
i
do
not
at
present
approve
but
i
am
not
sure
i
shall
never
approve
them
for
having
lived
long
i
have
experienced
many
instances
of
being
obliged
by
better
information
or
fuller
consideration
to
change
opinions
even
on
important
subjects
which
i
once
thought
right
but
found
to
be
otherwise
it
is
therefore
that
the
older
i
grow
the
more
apt
i
am
to
doubt
my
own
judgment
and
to
pay
more
respect
to
the
judgment
of
others
most
men
indeed
as
well
as
most
sects
in
religion
think
themselves
in
possession
of
all
truth
and
that
wherever
others
differ
from
them
it
is
so
far
error
steele
a
protestant
in
a
dedication
tells
the
pope
that
the
only
difference
between
our
churches
in
their
opinions
of
the
certainty
of
their
doctrines
is
church
of
rome
is
infallible
and
the
church
of
england
is
never
in
the
wrong
but
though
many
private
persons
think
almost
as
highly
of
their
own
infallibility
as
of
that
of
their
sect
few
express
it
so
naturally
as
a
certain
french
lady
who
in
a
dispute
with
her
sister
said
do
know
how
it
happens
sister
but
i
meet
with
nobody
but
myself
that
is
always
in
the
right
a
que
moi
qui
a
toujours
raison
in
these
sentiments
sir
i
agree
to
this
constitution
with
all
its
faults
if
they
are
such
because
i
think
a
general
government
necessary
for
us
and
there
is
no
form
of
government
but
what
may
be
a
blessing
to
the
people
if
well
administered
and
believe
further
that
this
is
likely
to
be
well
administered
for
a
course
of
years
and
can
only
end
in
despotism
as
other
forms
have
done
before
it
when
the
people
shall
become
so
corrupted
as
to
need
despotic
government
being
incapable
of
any
other
i
doubt
too
whether
any
other
convention
we
can
obtain
may
be
able
to
make
a
better
constitution
for
when
you
assemble
a
number
of
men
to
have
the
advantage
of
their
joint
wisdom
you
inevitably
assemble
with
those
men
all
their
prejudices
their
passions
their
errors
of
opinion
their
local
interests
and
their
selfish
views
from
such
an
assembly
can
a
perfect
production
be
expected
it
therefore
astonishes
me
sir
to
find
this
system
approaching
so
near
to
perfection
as
it
does
and
i
think
it
will
astonish
our
enemies
who
are
waiting
with
confidence
to
hear
that
our
councils
are
confounded
like
those
of
the
builders
of
babel
and
that
our
states
are
on
the
point
of
separation
only
to
meet
hereafter
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
one
another
throats
thus
i
consent
sir
to
this
constitution
because
i
expect
no
better
and
because
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
the
best
the
opinions
i
have
had
of
its
errors
i
sacrifice
to
the
public
good
i
have
never
whispered
a
syllable
of
them
abroad
within
these
walls
they
were
born
and
here
they
shall
die
if
every
one
of
us
in
returning
to
our
constituents
were
to
report
the
objections
he
has
had
to
it
and
endeavour
to
gain
partisans
in
support
of
them
we
might
prevent
its
being
generally
received
and
thereby
lose
all
the
salutary
effects
and
great
advantages
resulting
naturally
in
our
favour
among
foreign
nations
as
well
as
among
ourselves
from
our
real
or
apparent
unanimity
much
of
the
strength
and
efficiency
of
any
government
in
procuring
and
securing
happiness
to
the
people
depends
on
opinion
on
the
general
opinion
of
the
goodness
of
the
government
as
well
as
of
the
wisdom
and
integrity
of
its
governors
i
hope
therefore
that
for
our
own
sakes
as
a
part
of
the
people
and
for
the
sake
of
posterity
we
shall
act
heartily
and
unanimously
in
recommending
this
constitution
if
approved
by
congress
and
confirmed
by
the
conventions
wherever
our
influence
may
extend
and
turn
our
future
thoughts
and
endeavours
to
the
means
of
having
it
well
administered
on
the
whole
sir
i
can
not
help
expressing
a
wish
that
every
member
of
the
convention
who
may
still
have
objections
to
it
would
with
me
on
this
occasion
doubt
a
little
of
his
own
infallibility
and
to
make
manifest
our
unanimity
put
his
name
to
this
instrument
he
then
moved
that
the
constitution
be
signed
by
the
members
and
offered
the
following
as
a
convenient
form
viz
done
in
convention
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
present
the
seventeenth
of
september
etc
in
witness
whereof
we
have
hereunto
subscribed
our
names
this
ambiguous
form
had
been
drawn
up
by
gouverneur
morris
in
order
to
gain
the
dissenting
members
and
put
into
the
hands
of
doctor
franklin
that
it
might
have
the
better
chance
of
success
considerable
discussion
followed
randolph
and
gerry
stating
their
reasons
for
refusing
to
sign
the
constitution
hamilton
expressed
his
anxiety
that
every
member
should
sign
a
few
characters
of
consequence
he
said
by
opposing
or
even
refusing
to
sign
the
constitution
might
do
infinite
mischief
by
kindling
the
latent
sparks
that
lurk
under
an
enthusiasm
in
favour
of
the
convention
which
may
soon
subside
no
man
ideas
were
more
remote
from
the
plan
than
his
own
were
known
to
be
but
is
it
possible
to
deliberate
between
anarchy
and
convulsion
on
one
side
and
the
chance
of
good
to
be
expected
from
the
plan
on
the
other
this
discussion
concluded
the
convention
voted
that
its
journal
and
other
papers
should
be
retained
by
the
president
subject
to
the
order
of
congress
the
members
then
proceeded
to
sign
the
constitution
as
finally
amended
the
constitution
being
signed
by
all
the
members
except
randolph
mason
and
gerry
who
declined
giving
it
the
sanction
of
their
names
the
convention
dissolved
itself
by
an
adjournment
sine
die
whilst
the
last
members
were
signing
doctor
franklin
looking
towards
the
president
chair
at
the
back
of
which
a
rising
sun
happened
to
be
painted
observed
to
a
few
members
near
him
that
painters
had
found
it
difficult
to
distinguish
in
their
art
a
rising
from
a
setting
sun
i
have
said
he
often
and
often
in
the
course
of
the
session
and
the
vicissitudes
of
my
hopes
and
fears
as
to
its
issue
looked
at
that
behind
the
president
without
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
rising
or
setting
but
now
at
length
i
have
the
happiness
to
know
that
it
is
a
rising
and
not
a
setting
sun

treat
with

scots
concerning
the
restoring
his

his
right
and
liberties
in
the

form
and
manner
as
we
shall
do

unless
by
the
charters
which
we
have
from
his

william
late
king
of

it
ought
to
be
otherwise

this
shall
be
left
to
the
determination

all
the

that

days
reckoning

should
be
out

the
four

lay
the
cause
before

said
barons
together
with

whole
kingdom
shall
distrain

distress
us
in
all
the
ways
in
which
they
shall
be
able
by
seizing
our
castles
lands
possessions
and
in
any
other
manner
they
can
till
the
grievance
is
redressed
according
to
their
pleasure
saving
harmless
our
own
person
and
the
persons
of
our
queen
and
children
and
when
it
is
redressed
they
shall
behave
to
us
as
before
and
any
person
whatsoever
in
the
kingdom
may
swear
that
he
will
obey
the
orders
of
the
barons
aforesaid
in
the
execution
of
the
premises
and
will
distress
us
jointly
with
them
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
and
we
give
public
and
free
liberty
to
any
one
that
shall
please
to
swear
to
this
and
never
will
hinder
any
person
from
taking
the
same
oath
as
for
all
those
of
our
subjects
who
will
not
of
their
own
accord
swear
to
join
the
barons
in
distraining
and
distressing
us
we
will
issue
orders
to
make
them
take
the
same
oath
as
aforesaid
and
if
any
one
of
the
barons
dies
or
goes
out
of
the
kingdom
or
is
hindered
any
other
way
from
carrying
the
things
aforesaid
into
execution
the

may
choose
another
in
his
room
at
their
discretion
who
shall
be
sworn
in
like
manner
as
the
rest
in
all
things
that
are
committed
to
the
execution
of
these
barons
if
when
they
are
all
assembled
together
they
should
happen
to
disagree
about
any
matter
and
some
of
them
when
summoned
will
not
or
can
not
come
whatever
is
agreed
upon
or
enjoined
by
the
major
part
of
those
that
are
present
shall
be
reputed
as
firm

valid
as
if
all
the

given
their
consent

aforesaid
shall
swear
that
all
the
premises
they
shall
faithfully
observe
and
cause
with
all
their
power
to
be
observed

we
will
procure
nothing
from
any
one
by
ourselves
nor
by
another
whereby
any
of
these
concessions
and
liberties
may
be
revoked
or
lessened
and
if
any
such
thing
shall
have
been
obtained
let
it
be
null
and
void
neither
will
we
ever
make
use
of
it
either
by
ourselves

any
other
and
all
the
indignations
and
rancours
that
have
arisen
between
us
and
our
subjects
of
the
clergy
and

from
the
first
breaking
out
of
the
dissensions
between

we
do
fully
remit

moreover
all
trespasses
occasioned
by
the
said

hereby
entirely
remit

as
far
as
in

the

only
for
their

to
elucidate
the
most
unusual
and
perplexing
expressions
the
charter
printed
in

of
henry

also
the
one

the
charter
of
henry

differs
in
some
generally
insignificant
points
from
that
of

the
most
important
difference
is
the
omission
in
the
later

articles
of

by
which
the
king
is
restricted
from
levying

the

says
stubbs
is
a
commentary
on
this

shall

that

that
our

sheriffs
mayors

other
ministers

their
points

and
we
will
that
the

shall
be

to
cathedral
churches
throughout
our

there
to
remain
and
shall
be
read
before
the
people
two
times
by

and
that
all
archbishops
and
bishops
shall
pronounce
the
sentence
of
great
excommunication
against
all
those
that
by
word
deed
or
counsel
do
contrary
to
the
foresaid
charters
or
that
in
any
point
break
or
undo
them
and
that
the
said
curses
be
twice
a
year
denounced
and
published
by
the
prelates
aforesaid
and
if
the
prelates
or
any
of
them
be
remiss
in
the
denunciation
of
the
said
sentences
the
archbishops
of
canterbury
and
york
for
the
time
being
as
is
fitting
shall
compel
and
distrain
them
to
make
that
denunciation
in
form
aforesaid
and
for
so
much
as
divers
people
of
our
realm
are
in
fear
that
the
aids
and
tasks
which
they
have
given
to
us
beforetime
towards
our
wars
and
other
business
of
their
own
grant
and
goodwill
howsoever
they
were
made
might
turn
to
a
bondage
to
them
and
their
heirs
because
they
might
be
at
another
time
found
in
the
rolls
and
so
likewise
the
prises
taken
throughout
the
realm
by
our
ministers
we
have
granted
for
us
and
our
heirs
that
we
shall
not
draw
such
aids
tasks
nor
prises
into
a
custom
for
anything
that
hath
been
done
heretofore
or
that
may
be
found
by
roll
or
in
any
other
manner
vi
moreover
we
have
granted
for
us
and
our
heirs
as
well
to
archbishops
bishops
abbots
priors
and
other
folk
of
holy
church
as
also
to
earls
barons
and
to
all
the
commonalty
of
the
land
that
for
no
business
from
henceforth
will
we
take
such
manner
of
aids
tasks
nor
prises
but
by
the
common
consent
of
the
realm
and
for
the
common
profit
thereof
saving
the
ancient
aids
and
prises
due
and
accustomed
vii
and
for
so
much
as
the
more
part
of
the
commonalty
of
the
realm
find
themselves
sore
grieved
with
the
matelote
of
wools
that
is
to
wit
a
toll
of
forty
shillings
for
every
sack
of
wool
and
have
made
petition
to
us
to
release
the
same
we
at
their
requests
have
clearly
released
it
and
have
granted
for
us
and
our
heirs
that
we
shall
not
take
such
thing
nor
any
other
without
their
common
assent
and
goodwill
saving
to
us
and
our
heirs
the
custom
of
wools
skins
and
leather
granted
before
by
the
commonalty
aforesaid
in
witness
of
which
things
we
have
caused
these
our
letters
to
be
made
patents
witness
edward
our
son
at
london
the
day
of
october
the
of
our
reign
and
be
it
remembered
that
this
same
charter
in
the
same
terms
word
for
word
was
sealed
in
flanders
under
the
king
great
seal
that
is
to
say
at

day
of

in
the
year
of
the
reign
of

aforesaid
lord
the
king
and
sent
into
england
the
words
of
this
important
document
from
professor
translation
are
given
as
the
best
explanation
of
the
constitutional
position
and
importance
of
the
charters
of
john
and
henry
iii
see
historical
notice
in
stubbs
illustrative
of
english
this
is
far
the
most
important
of
the
numerous
ratifications
of
the
great
charter
hallam
calls
it
that
famous
statute
inadequately
denominated
the
confirmation
of
the
charters
because
it
added
another
pillar
to
our
constitution
not
less
important
than
the
great
charter
itself
it
solemnly
confirmed
the
two
charters
the
charter
of
the
forest
issued
by
henry
ii
in
see
text
in
stubbs
being
then
considered
as
of
equal
importance
with
magna
charta
itself
establishing
them
in
all
points
as
the
law
of
the
land
but
it
did
more
hitherto
the
king
prerogative
of
levying
money
by
name
of
or
from
his
towns
and
tenants
in
demesne
had
passed
unquestioned
some
impositions
that
especially
on
the
export
of
wool
affected
all
the
king
subjects
it
was
now
the
moment
to
enfranchise
the
people
and
give
that
security
to
private
property
which
magna
charta
had
given
to
personal
liberty
statute
binds
the
king
never
to
take
any
of
these
aids
tasks
and
prises
in
future
save
by
the
common
assent
of
the
realm
hence
as
bowen
remarks
the
confirmation
of
the
charters
or
an
abstract
of
it
under
the
form
of
a
supposed
statute
tallagio

more
frequently
cited

shriveled

the
barons
covered
the
marshy
flat
still
known
by
the
name
of
runnymede
on
the
other
their
delegates
met
in
the
island
between
them
but
the
negotiations
were
a
mere
cloak
to
cover
john
purpose
of
unconditional
submission
the
great
charter
was
discussed
agreed
to
and
signed
in
a
single
day
one
copy
of
it
still
remains
in
the
british
museum
injured
by
age
and
fire
but
with
the
royal
seal
still
hanging
from
the
brown
shrivelled
parchment
it
is
impossible
to
gaze
without
reverence
on
the
earliest
monument
of
english
freedom
which
we
can
see
with
our
own
eyes
and
touch
with
our
own
hands
the
great
charter
to
which
from
age
to
age
patriots
have
looked
back
as
the
basis
of
english
liberty
but
in
itself
the
charter
was
no
novelty
nor
did
it
claim
to
establish
any
new
constitutional
principles
the
charter
of
henry
the
first
formed
the
basis
of
the
whole
and
the
additions
to
it
are
for
the
most
part
formal
recognitions
of
the
judicial
and
administrative
changes
introduced
by
henry
the
second
but
the
vague
expressions
of
the
older
charters
were
now
exchanged
for
precise
and
elaborate
provisions
the
bonds
of
unwritten
custom
which
the
older
grants
did
little
more
than
recognize
had
proved
too
weak
to
hold
the
angevins
and
the
baronage
now
threw
them
aside
for
the
restraints
of
written
law
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
great
charter
marks
the
transition
from
the
age
of
traditional
rights
preserved
in
the
nation
memory
and
officially
declared
by
the
primate
to
the
age
of
written
legislation
of
parliaments
and
statutes
which
was
soon
to
come
the
church
had
shown
its
power
of
in
the
struggle
over
the
interdict
and
the
clause
which
recognized
its
rights
alone
retained
the
older
and
general
form
but
all
vagueness
ceases
when
the
charter
passes
on
to
deal
with
the
rights
of
englishmen
at
large
their
right
to
justice
to
of
person
and
property
to
good
freeman
ran
the
memorable
article
that
lies
at
the
base
of
our
whole
judicial
system
be
seized
or
imprisoned
or
dispossessed
or
outlawed
or
in
any
way
brought
to
ruin
we
will
not
go
against
any
man
nor
send
against
him
save
by
legal
judgment
of
his
peers
or
by
the
law
of
the
land
no
man
will
we
sell
runs
another
deny
or
delay
right
or
justice
the
great
reforms
of
the
past
reigns
were
now
formally
recognized
judges
of
assize
were
to
hold
their
circuits
four
times
in
the
year
and
the
court
of
common
pleas
was
no
longer
to
follow
the
king
in
his
wanderings
over
the
realm
but
to
sit
in
a
fixed
place
but
the
denial
of
justice
under
john
was
a
small
danger
compared
with
the
lawless
exactions
both
of
himself
and
his
predecessor
richard
had
increased
the
amount
of
the
scutage
which
henry
ii
had
introduced
and
applied
it
to
raise
funds
for
his
ransom
he
had
restored
the
danegeld
or
land
tax
so
often
abolished
under
the
new
name
of
had
seized
the
wool
of
the
cistercians
and
the
plate
of
the
churches
and
rated
movables
as
well
as
land
john
had
again
raised
the
rate
of
scutage
and
imposed
aids
fines
and
ransoms
at
his
pleasure
without
counsel
of
the
baronage
the
great
charter
met
this
abuse
by
the
provision
on
which
our
constitutional
system
rests
with
the
exception
of
the
three
customary
feudal
aids
which
still
remained
to
the
crown
scutage
or
aid
shall
be
imposed
in
our
realm
save
by
the
common
council
of
the
realm
and
to
this
great
council
it
was
provided
that
prelates
and
the
greater
barons
should
be
summoned
by
special
writ
and
all
tenants
in
chief
through
the
sheriffs
and
bailiffs
at
least
forty
days
before
but
it
was
less
easy
to
provide
means
for
the
control
of
a
king
whom
no
man
could
trust
and
a
council
of
barons
was
chosen
from
the
general
body
of
their
order
to
enforce
on
john
the
observance
of
the
charter
with
the
right
of
declaring
war
on
the
king
should
its
provisions
be
infringed
finally
the
charter
was
published
throughout
the
whole
country
and
sworn
to
at
every
and
by
order
from
the
short
history
of
the
english
appendix
a
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
an
act
for
declaring
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
subject
and
settling
the
succession
of
the
crown
whereas
the
lords
spiritual
and

and

assembled
at
westminster
lawfully
fully
and
freely
representing
all
the
estates
of
the
people
of

upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
february
in

of
our
lord
one
thousand
six
hundred
present
unto
their
majesties
then
called

known
by
the
names
and

of
william
and

prince
and
princess
of
orange
being
present
in
their
proper
persons
a
certain
declaration
in
writing
made
by
the
said
lords
and
commons
in
the
words
following
viz
footnote
in
new
style
whereas
the
late
king
james
by
the
assistance
of
divers
evil
counsellors
judges
and
ministers
employed
by
him
did
endeavour
to
subvert
and
extirpate
the
protestant
religion
and
the
laws
and
liberties
of
this
kingdom
by
assuming
and
exercising
a
power
of
dispensing
with
and
suspending
of
laws
and
the
execution
of
laws
without
consent
of
parliament
by
committing
and
prosecuting
divers
worthy
prelates
for
humbly
petitioning
to
be
excused
from
concurring
to
the
said
assumed
power
by
issuing
and
causing
to
be
executed
a
commission
under
the
great
seal
for
erecting
a
court
called
the
court
of
commissioners
for
ecclesiastical
causes
by
levying
money
for
and
to
the
use
of
the
crown
by
pretence
of
prerogative
for
other
time
and
in
other
manner
than
the
same
was
granted
by
parliament
by
raising
and
keeping
a
standing
army
within
this
kingdom
in
time
of
peace
without
consent
of
parliament
and
quartering
soldiers
contrary
to
law
by
causing
several
good
subjects
being
protestants
to
be
disarmed
at
the
same
time
when
papists
were
both
armed
and
employed
contrary
to
law
by
violating
the
freedom
of
election
of
members
to
serve
in
parliament
by
prosecutions
in
the
court
of
king
bench
for
matters
and
causes
cognizable
only
in
parliament
and
by
divers
other
arbitrary
and
illegal
causes
and
whereas
of
late
years
partial
corrupt
and
unqualified
persons
have
been
returned
and
served
on
juries
in
trials
and
particularly
divers
jurors
in
trials
for
high
treason
which
were
not
freeholders
and
excessive
bail
hath
been
required
of
persons
committed
in
criminal
cases
to
elude
the
benefit
of
the
laws
made
for
the
liberty
of
the
subjects
and
excessive
fines
have
been
imposed
and
illegal
and
cruel
punishments
inflicted
and
several
grants
and
promises
made
of
fines
and
forfeitures
before
any
conviction
or
judgment
against
the
persons
upon
whom
the
same
were
to
be
levied
all
which
are
utterly
and
directly
contrary
to
the
known
laws
and
statutes
and
freedom
of
this
realm
and
whereas
the
said
late
king
james
ii
having
abdicated
the
government
and
the
throne
being
thereby
vacant
his
highness
the
prince
of
orange
whom
it
hath
pleased
almighty
god
to
make
the
glorious
instrument
of
delivering
this
kingdom
from
popery
and
arbitrary
power
did
by
the
advice
of
the
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
and
divers
principal
persons
of
the
commons
cause
letters
to
be
written
to
the
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
being
protestants
and
other
letters
to
the
several
counties
cities
universities
boroughs
and
cinque
ports
for
the
choosing
of
such
persons
to
represent
them
as
were
of
right
to
be
sent
to
parliament
to
meet
and
sit
at
westminster
upon
the
day
of
january
in
this
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
eighty
and
eight
in
order
to
such
an
establishment
as
that
their
religion
laws
and
liberties
might
not
again
be
in
danger
of
being
subverted
upon
which
letters
elections
have
been
accordingly
made
footnote
in
new

and
thereupon
the
said
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
and
commons
pursuant
to
their
respective
letters
and
elections
being
now
assembled
in
a
full

taking
into

serious
consideration

i
was

is
i
swore
to

as
near

can
remember
at

of
on

day
of

the

to
the
best
of
my
knowledge

belief
in
usual
dated
at
the
city
of

of
this
day
of
first
subject
one
of
the

will
distinctly
read
at
a
rate
reasonable
for
copying
fifteen
lines
from
the

each
applicant
will
copy
the

below
from

reading
as
it
proceeds
write
below
at
length
the
names
of
fifteen
states
and
fifteen
cities
of

copy
the
following
and
in
my
opinion
sir
this
principle
of
claiming
monopoly
of
office
by
the
right
of
conquest
unless
the
public
shall
effectually
rebuke
and
restrain
it
will
effectually
change
the
character
of
our
government
it
elevates
party
above
country
it
forgets
the
common
weal
in
the
pursuit
of
personal
emolument
it
tends
to
form
it
does
form
we
see
that
it
has
formed
a
political
combination
united
by
no
common
principles
or
opinions
among
its
members
either
upon
the
powers
of
the
government
or
the
true
policy
of
the
country
but
held
together
simply
as
an
association
under
the
charm
