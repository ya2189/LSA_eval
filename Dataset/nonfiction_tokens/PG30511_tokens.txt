no
bird
song
how
songs
are
made
is
a
mystery
which
studied
for
years
still
baffles
me
stoddard
some
birds
are
poets
and
sing
all
summer
says
thoreau
they
are
the
true
singers
any
man
can
write
verses
in
the
love
season
we
are
most
interested
in
those
birds
that
sing
for
the
love
of
music
and
not
of
their
mates
who
meditate
their
strains
and
amuse
themselves
with
singing
the
birds
whose
strains
are
of
deeper
sentiment
thoreau
does
not
mention
by
name
any
of
the
to
which
he
alludes
but
we
think
our
selections
for
the
present
month
include
some
of
them
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
all
which
is
as
rich
in
color
and
as
the
most
polished
gem
to
which
he
owes
his
name
the
humming
bird
can
not
sing
at
all
uttering
only
a
shrill
squeak
the
humming
sound
made
by
his
wings
is
far
more
agreeable
than
his
voice
for
when
the
mild
gold
stars
flower
out
it
announces
his
presence
then
a
dim
shape
quivers
about
some
sweet
rich
heart
of
a
rose
he
hovers
over
all
the
flowers
that
possess
the
peculiar
sweetness
that
he
loves
the
blossoms
of
the
honeysuckle
the
red
the
white
and
the
yellow
roses
and
the
morning
glory
the
red
clover
is
as
sweet
to
him
as
to
the
honey
bee
and
a
pair
of
them
may
often
be
seen
hovering
over
the
blossoms
for
a
moment
and
then
disappearing
with
the
quickness
of
a
flash
of
light
soon
to
return
to
the
same
spot
and
repeat
the
performance
squeak
is
probably
their
call
note
something
of
the
poet
is
the
yellow
warbler
though
his
song
is
not
quite
as
long
as
an
epic
he
repeats
it
a
little
too
often
perhaps
but
there
is
such
a
pervading
cheerfulness
about
it
that
we
will
not
quarrel
with
the
author
is
his
frequent
contribution
to
the
volume
of
nature
and
all
the
while
he
is
darting
about
the
trees
carrying
on
his
back
wherever
he
goes
his
song
is
appropriate
to
every
season
but
it
is
in
the
spring
when
we
hear
it
first
that
it
is
doubly
welcome
to
the
ear
the
grateful
heart
asks
with
bourdillon
what
tidings
hath
the
warbler
heard
that
bids
him
leave
the
lands
of
summer
for
woods
and
fields
where
april
yields
bleak
welcome
to
the
blithe
newcomer
the
mourning
dove
may
be
called
the
poet
of
melancholy
for
its
song
is
to
us
without
one
element
of
cheerfulness
hopeless
despair
is
in
every
note
and
as
the
bird
undoubtedly
does
have
cheerful
moods
as
indicated
by
its
actions
its
song
must
be
appreciated
only
by
its
mate
suddenly
thrown
upon
the
air
and
resounding
near
and
far
is
something
hardly
to
be
extolled
we
should
think
and
yet
the
beautiful
and
graceful
dove
possesses
so
many
pretty
ways
that
every
one
is
attracted
to
it
and
the
tender
affection
of
the
mated
pair
is
so
manifest
and
their
constancy
so
conspicuous
that
the
name
has
become
a
symbol
of
domestic
concord
the
cuckoo
must
utter
his
note
in
order
to
be
recognized
for
few
that
are
learned
in
bird
lore
can
discriminate
him
save
from
his
notes
he
proclaims
himself
by
calling
forth
his
own
name
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
mistake
about
him
well
his
note
is
an
agreeable
one
and
has
made
him
famous
as
he
loses
his
song
in
the
summer
months
he
is
inclined
to
make
good
use
of
it
when
he
finds
it
again
english
boys
are
so
skillful
in
imitating
the
cuckoo
song
which
they
do
to
an
exasperating
extent
that
the
bird
himself
may
often
wish
for
that
of
the
nightingale
which
is
inimitable
but
the
cuckoo
song
monotonous
as
it
is
is
decidedly
to
be
preferred
to
that
of
the
female
house
wren
with
its
when
suspicious
or
in
anger
the
male
however
is
a
real
poet
let
us
say
and
sings
a
merry
roulade
sudden
abruptly
ended
and
frequently
repeated
he
sings
apparently
for
the
love
of
music
and
is
as
merry
and
gay
when
his
mate
is
absent
as
when
she
is
at
his
side
proving
that
his
singing
is
not
solely
for
her
benefit
so
good
an
authority
as
coues
vouches
for
the
exquisite
vocalization
of
the
kinglet
have
you
ever
heard
a
wire
vibrating
such
is
the
call
note
of
the
ruby
thin
and
metallic
but
his
song
has
a
fullness
a
variety
and
a
melody
which
being
often
heard
in
the
spring
migration
make
this
feathered
beauty
additionally
attractive
many
of
the
fine
songsters
are
not
brilliantly
attired
but
this
fellow
has
a
combination
of
attractions
to
commend
him
as
worthy
of
the
bird
student
careful
attention
of
the
hermit
thrush
whose
song
is
celebrated
we
will
say
only
read
everything
you
can
find
about
him
he
will
not
be
discovered
easily
for
even
olive
thorne
miller
who
is
presumed
to
know
all
about
birds
tells
of
her
pursuit
of
the
hermit
in
northern
new
york
where
it
was
said
to
be
abundant
and
finding
when
she
looked
for
him
that
he
had
always
been
there
and
was
gone
but
one
day
in
august
she
saw
the
bird
and
heard
the
song
and
exclaimed
this
only
was
lacking
this
crowns
my
summer
the
song
sparrow
can
sing
too
and
the
phoebe
beloved
of
man
and
the
nuthatch
a
little
they
do
not
require
the
of
the
hermit
thrush
whose
very
name
implies
that
he
prefers
to
flock
by
himself
but
can
be
seen
in
our
parks
throughout
the
season
but
the
sparrow
loves
the
companionship
of
man
and
has
often
been
a
solace
to
him
it
is
stated
by
the
biographer
of
kant
the
great
metaphysician
that
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
had
become
indifferent
to
much
that
was
passing
around
him
in
which
he
had
formerly
taken
great
interest
the
flowers
showed
their
beautious
hues
to
him
in
vain
his
weary
vision
gave
little
heed
to
their
loveliness
their
perfume
came
unheeded
to
the
sense
which
before
had
inhaled
it
with
eagerness
the
coming
on
of
spring
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
hail
with
delight
now
gave
him
no
joy
save
that
it
brought
back
a
little
sparrow
which
came
annually
and
made
its
home
in
a
tree
that
stood
by
his
window
year
after
year
as
one
generation
went
the
way
of
all
the
earth
another
would
return
to
its
to
reward
the
tender
care
of
their
benefactor
by
singing
to
him
their
pleasant
songs
and
he
longed
for
their
return
in
the
spring
with
an
eagerness
and
intensity
of
expectation
how
many
provisions
nature
has
for
keeping
us
and
the
song
sparrow
is
one
of
them

the
yellow
warbler
in
a
recent
article
angus
gaines
describes
so
delightfully
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
yellow
warbler
or
summer
sometimes
called
the
wild
canary
that
we
are
tempted
to
make
use
of
part
of
it
back
and
forth
across
the
garden
the
little
yellow
birds
were
flitting
dodging
through
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
hiding
in
the
lilacs
swaying
for
an
instant
on
swinging
sprays
of
grape
vines
and
then
flashing
out
across
the
garden
beds
like
yellow
sunbeams
they
were
lithe
slender
dainty
little
creatures
and
were
so
quick
in
their
movements
that
i
could
not
recognize
them
at
first
but
when
one
of
them
hopped
down
before
me
lifted
a
fallen
leaf
and
dragged
a
cutworm
from
beneath
it
and
turning
his
head
gave
me
a
sidewise
glance
with
his
victim
still
struggling
in
his
beak
i
knew
him
his
gay
coat
was
yellow
without
the
black
cap
wings
and
tail
which
show
in
such
marked
contrast
to
the
bright
canary
hue
of
that
other
yellow
bird
the
small
and
delicate
as
these
birds
are
they
had
been
on
a
long
journey
to
the
southward
to
spend
the
winter
and
now
on
the
first
of
may
they
had
returned
to
their
old
home
to
find
the
land
at
its
fairest
all
blossoms
buds
balmy
air
sunshine
and
melody
as
they
flitted
about
in
their
restless
way
they
sang
the
soft
low
warbling
trills
which
gave
them
their
name
of
yellow
warbler
wright
says
these
beautiful
birds
come
like
whirling
leaves
half
autumn
yellow
half
green
of
spring
the
colors
blending
as
in
the
outer
petals
of
daffodils
lovable
cheerful
little
spirits
darting
about
the
trees
exclaiming
at
each
morsel
that
they
glean
carrying
sun
glints
on
their
backs
wherever
they
go
they
should
make
the
gloomiest
misanthrope
feel
the
season
charm
they
are
so
sociable
and
confiding
feeling
as
much
at
home
in
the
trees
by
the
house
as
in
seclusion
the
builds
in
bushes
and
the
nest
is
a
wonderful
example
of
bird
architecture
milkweed
lint
and
its
strips
of
fine
bark
are
glued
to
twigs
and
form
the
exterior
of
the
nest
its
inner
lining
is
made
of
the
silky
down
on
woven
together
with
in
this
dainty
nest
are
laid
four
or
five
creamy
white
eggs
speckled
with
lilac
tints
and
the
unwelcome
egg
of
the
is
often
found
in
the
nest
but
this
warbler
builds
a
floor
over
the
egg
repeating
the
expedient
if
the
continues
her
mischief
until
sometimes
a
third
story
is
erected
a
pair
of
summer
we
are
told
had
built
their
nest
in
a
wild
rose
bush
and
were
rearing
their
family
in
a
wilderness
of
fragrant
blossoms
whose
tinted
petals
dropped
upon
the
dainty
nest
or
settled
upon
the
back
of
the
brooding
mother
the
birds
however
did
not
stay
to
have
their
pictures
taken
but
their
nest
may
be
seen
among
the
roses
the
yellow
warbler
song
is
seven
times
repeated
the
hermit
thrush
in
john
burroughs
birds
and
poets
this
master
singer
is
described
as
the
most
melodious
of
our
songsters
with
the
exception
of
the
wood
thrush
a
bird
whose
strains
more
than
any
other
express
harmony
and
serenity
and
he
complains
that
no
merited
poetic
monument
has
yet
been
reared
to
it
but
there
can
be
no
good
reason
for
complaining
of
the
absence
of
appreciative
prose
concerning
the
hermit
one
writer
says
how
pleasantly
his
notes
greet
the
ear
amid
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
and
the
driving
snow
or
when
in
a
calm
and
lucid
interval
of
genial
weather
we
hear
him
sing
if
possible
more
richly
than
before
his
song
reminds
us
of
a
coming
season
when
the
now
dreary
landscape
will
be
clothed
in
a
blooming
garb
befitting
the
vernal
year
of
the
song
of
the
blackbird
and
lark
and
hosts
of
other
tuneful
throats
which
usher
in
that
lovely
season
should
you
disturb
him
when
singing
he
usually
drops
down
and
awaits
your
departure
though
sometimes
he
merely
retires
to
a
neighboring
tree
and
warbles
as
sweetly
as
before
in
birdcraft
wright
tells
us
better
than
any
one
else
the
story
of
the
hermit
she
says
this
spring
the
first
week
in
may
when
standing
at
the
window
about
six
in
the
morning
i
heard
an
unusual
note
and
listened
thinking
it
at
first
a
wood
thrush
and
then
a
thrasher
but
soon
finding
that
it
was
neither
of
these
i
opened
the
window
softly
and
looked
among
the
near
by
shrubs
with
my
glass
the
wonderful
melody
ascended
gradually
in
the
scale
as
it
progressed
now
trilling
now
legato
the
most
perfect
exalted
unrestrained
yet
withal
finished
bird
song
that
i
ever
heard
at
the
first
note
i
caught
sight
of
the
singer
perching
among
the
lower
sprays
of
a
dogwood
tree
i
could
see
him
perfectly
it
was
the
hermit
thrush
in
a
moment
he
began
again
i
have
never
heard
the
nightingale
but
those
who
have
say
that
it
is
the
surroundings
and
its
continuous
night
singing
that
make
it
even
the
equal
of
our
hermit
for
while
the
nightingales
sing
in
numbers
in
the
moonlit
groves
the
hermit
tunes
his
lute
sometimes
in
inaccessible
solitudes
and
there
is
something
immaterial
and
immortal
about
the
song
the
hermit
thrush
is
comparatively
common
in
the
northeast
and
in
pennsylvania
it
is
with
the
exception
of
the
robin
the
commonest
of
the
thrushes
in
the
eastern
as
in
many
of
the
middle
states
it
is
only
a
migrant
it
is
usually
regarded
as
a
shy
bird
it
is
a
species
of
more
general
distribution
than
any
of
the
small
thrushes
being
found
entirely
across
the
continent
and
north
to
the
arctic
regions
it
is
not
quite
the
same
bird
however
in
all
parts
of
its
range
the
rocky
mountain
region
being
occupied
by
a
larger
grayer
race
while
on
the
pacific
coast
a
dwarf
race
takes
its
place
it
is
known
in
parts
of
new
england
as
the
ground
swamp
robin
and
in
other
localities
as
swamp
angel
true
lovers
of
nature
find
a
certain
spiritual
satisfaction
in
the
song
of
this
bird
in
the
evening
twilight
of
a
june
day
says
one
of
these
when
all
nature
seemed
resting
in
quiet
the
liquid
melting
lingering
notes
of
the
solitary
bird
would
steal
out
upon
the
air
and
move
us
strangely
what
was
the
feeling
it
awoke
in
our
hearts
was
it
sorrow
or
joy
fear
or
hope
memory
or
expectation
and
while
we
listened
we
thought
the
meaning
of
it
all
was
coming
it
was
trembling
on
the
air
and
in
an
instant
it
would
reach
us
then
it
faded
it
was
gone
and
we
could
not
even
remember
what
it
had
been

i
am
sorry
children
that
i
can
not
give
you
a
specimen
of
my
song
as
an
introduction
to
the
short
story
of
my
life
one
writer
about
my
family
says
it
is
like

if
i
were
talking

may

my
notes
do
sound
something
like
that
but
i
prefer
you
should
hear
me
sing
when
i
am
alone
in
the
woods
and
other
birds
are
silent
it
is
ever
being
said
of
me
that
i
am
as
fine
a
singer
as
the
english
nightingale
i
wish
i
could
hear
this
rival
of
mine
and
while
i
have
no
doubt
his
voice
is
a
sweet
one
and
i
am
not
too
vain
of
my
own
i
should
like
to
compare
notes
with
him
why
do
not
some
of
you
children
ask
your
parents
to
invite
a
few
pairs
of
nightingales
to
come
and
settle
here
they
would
like
our
climate
and
would
i
am
sure
be
welcomed
by
all
the
birds
with
a
warmth
not
accorded
the
english
sparrow
who
has
taken
possession
and
in
spite
of
my
love
for
secret
hiding
places
will
not
let
even
me
alone
when
you
are
older
children
you
can
read
all
about
me
in
another
part
of

i
will
merely
tell
you
here
that
i
live
with
you
only
from
may
to
october
coming
and
going
away
in
company
with
the
other
thrushes
though
i
keep
pretty
well
to
myself
while
here
and
while
building
my
nest
and
bringing
up
my
little
ones
i
hide
myself
from
the
face
of
man
although
i
do
not
fear
his
presence
that
is
why
i
am
called
the
hermit
if
you
wish
to
know
in
what
way
i
am
unlike
my
cousin
thrushes
in
appearance
turn

pages

there
you
will
see

i
am

the

the

some
call
me
the

with

other

to
me
as

himself
and
sing
it
was
there
perhaps
last
year
that
his
little
house
he
built
for
he
seemed
to
perk
and
peer
and
to
twitter
too
and
tilt
the
bare
branches

we
do
not
think
it
at
all
amiss
to
say
that
this
darling
among
song
birds
can
be
heard
singing
nearly
everywhere
the
whole
year
round
although
he
is
supposed
to
come
in
march
and
leave
us
in
november
we
have
heard
him
in
february
when
his
little
feet
made
tracks
in
the
newly
fallen
snow
singing
as
cheerily
as
in
april
may
and
june
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
in
ecstacy
even
in
august
when
the
heat
of
the
and
his
moulting
time
drive
him
to
leafy
seclusion
his
liquid
notes
may
be
listened
for
with
certainty
while
all
through
october
they
sound
clearly
above
the
rustling
leaves
and
some
morning
he
comes
to
the
dogwood
by
the
arbor
and
announces
the
first
frost
in
a
song
that
is
more
direct
than
that
in
which
he
told
of
spring
while
the
chestnuts
fall
from
their
velvet
nests
he
is
singing
in
the
hedge
but
when
the
brush
heaps
burn
away
to
fragrant
smoke
in
november
they
veil
his
song
a
little
but
it
still
continues
while
the
song
sparrow
nests
in
the
extreme
northern
part
of
illinois
it
is
known
in
the
more
southern
portions
only
as
a
winter
resident
this
is
somewhat
remarkable
it
is
thought
since
along
the
atlantic
coast
it
is
one
of
the
most
abundant
summer
residents
throughout
maryland
and
virginia
in
the
same
latitudes
as
southern
illinois
where
it
is
a
winter
sojourner
abundant
but
very
retiring
inhabiting
almost
solely
the
bushy
swamps
in
the
bottom
lands
and
unknown
as
a
song
bird
this
is
regarded
as
a
remarkable
instance
of
variation
in
habits
with
locality
since
in
the
atlantic
states
it
breeds
abundantly
and
is
besides
one
of
the
most
familiar
of
the
native
birds
the
location
of
the
song
sparrow
nest
is
variable
sometimes
on
the
ground
or
in
a
low
bush
but
usually
in
as
secluded
a
place
as
its
instinct
of
preservation
enables
it
to
find
a
favorite
spot
is
a
deep
shaded
ravine
through
which
a
rivulet
ripples
where
the
solitude
is
disturbed
only
by
the
notes
of
his
song
made
more
sweet
and
clear
by
the
prevailing
silence

the
song
sparrow
dear
young
readers
i
fancy
many
of
the
little
folks
who
are
readers
of
birds
are
among
my
acquaintances
though
i
have
never
spoken
to
you
i
have
seen
your
eyes
brighten
when
my
limpid
little
song
has
been
borne
to
you
by
a
passing
breeze
which
made
known
my
presence
once
i
saw
a
pale
worn
face
turn
to
look
at
me
from
a
window
a
smile
of
pleasure
lighting
it
up
and
i
too
was
pleased
to
think
that
i
had
given
some
one
a
moment
happiness
i
have
seen
bird
lovers
for
we
have
lovers
and
many
of
them
pause
on
the
highway
and
listen
to
my
pretty
notes
which
i
know
as
well
as
any
one
have
a
cheerful
and
patient
sound
and
which
all
the
world
likes
for
to
be
cheered
and
encouraged
along
the
pathway
of
life
is
like
a
pleasant
medicine
to
my
weary
and
discouraged
fellow
citizens
for
you
must
know
i
am
a
citizen
as
my
friend
coues
calls
me
and
all
my
relatives
he
and
mabel
osgood
wright
have
written
a
book
about
us
called
citizen
bird
and
in
it
they
have
supported
us
in
all
our
rights
which
even
you
children
are
beginning
to
admit
we
have
you
are
kinder
to
us
than
you
used
to
be
some
of
you
come
quickly
to
our
rescue
from
untaught
and
thoughtless
boys
who
we
think
if
they
were
made
to
know
how
sensitive
we
are
to
suffering
and
wrong
would
turn
to
be
our
friends
and
protectors
instead
one
dear
boy
i
remember
well
and
he
is
considered
a
hero
by
the
song
sparrows
saved
a
nest
of
our
birdies
from
a
cruel
school
boy
robber
why
should
not
all
strong
boys
become
our
champions
many
of
them
have
great
honest
sympathetic
hearts
in
their
bosoms
and
if
we
can
only
enlist
them
in
our
favor
they
can
give
us
a
peace
and
protection
which
for
years
we
have
been
sighing
yes
sighing
because
our
hearts
though
little
are
none
the
less
susceptible
to
all
the
asperities
the
terrible
asperities
of
human
nature
papa
will
tell
you
what
i
mean
you
would
not
understand
bird
language
did
you
ever
see
my
nest
i
build
it
near
the
ground
and
sometimes
when
kind
friends
prepare
a
little
box
for
me
i
occupy
it
my
song
is
quite
varied
but
you
will
always
recognize
me
by
my
call
note
chek
chek
some
people
say
they
hear
me
repeat
maids
maids
maids
hang
on
your
teakettle
but
i
think
this
is
only
fancy
for
i
can
sing
a
real
song
admired
i
am
sure
by
all
who
love
song
sparrow
the
cuckoo
our
first
introduction
to
the
cuckoo
was
by
means
of
the
apparition
which
issued
hourly
from
a
little
german
clock
such
as
are
frequently
found
in
country
inns
this
particular
clock
had
but
one
dial
hand
and
the
exact
time
of
day
could
not
be
determined
by
it
until
the
appearance
of
the
cuckoo
who
in
a
squeaking
voice
seemed
to
announce
that
it
was
just
one
hour
later
or
earlier
as
the
case
might
be
than
at
his
last
appearance
we
were
puzzled
and
remember
fancying
that
a
sun
dial
in
clear
weather
would
be
far
more
satisfactory
as
a
time
piece
the
image
repeated
and
then
retired
until
the
hour
hand
should
summon
him
once
more
to
very
few
people
not
students
of
birds
is
the
cuckoo
really
known
its
evanescent
voice
is
often
recognized
but
being
a
solitary
wanderer
even
ornithologists
have
yet
to
learn
much
of
its
life
history
in
their
habits
the
american
and
european
cuckoos
are
so
similar
that
whatever
of
poetry
and
sentiment
has
been
written
of
them
is
applicable
alike
to
either
a
delightful
account
of
the
species
may
be
found
in
dixon
bird
life
a
book
of
refreshing
and
original
observation
the
cuckoo
is
found
in
the
verdant
woods
in
the
coppice
and
even
on
the
lonely
moors
he
flits
from
one
stunted
tree
to
another
and
utters
his
notes
in
company
with
the
wild
song
of
the
ring
ousel
and
the
harsh
calls
of
the
grouse
and
plover
though
his
notes
are
monotonous
still
no
one
gives
them
this
appellation
no
this
little
wanderer
is
held
too
dear
by
us
all
as
the
harbinger
of
spring
for
aught
but
praise
to
be
bestowed
on
his
mellow
notes
which
though
full
and
soft
are
powerful
and
may
on
a
calm
morning
before
the
everyday
hum
of
human
toil
begins
be
heard
a
mile
away
over
wood
field
and
lake
toward
the
summer
solstice
his
notes
are
on
the
wane
and
when
he
gives
them
forth
we
often
hear
him
utter
them
as
if
laboring
under
great
difficulty
and
resembling
the
syllables
on
one
occasion
dixon
says
he
heard
a
cuckoo
calling
in
treble
notes
inexpressibly
soft
and
beautiful
notably
the
latter
one
he
at
first
supposed
an
echo
was
the
cause
of
these
strange
notes
the
bird
being
then
half
a
mile
away
but
he
satisfied
himself
that
this
was
not
the
case
as
the
bird
came
and
alighted
on
a
noble
oak
a
few
yards
from
him
and
repeated
the
notes
the
cuckoo
utters
his
notes
as
he
flies
but
only
as
a
rule
when
a
few
yards
from
the
place
on
which
he
intends
alighting
the
opinion
is
held
by
some
observers
that
nature
has
not
intended
the
cuckoo
to
build
a
nest
but
influences
it
to
lay
its
eggs
in
the
nests
of
other
birds
and
intrust
its
young
to
the
care
of
those
species
best
adapted
to
bring
them
to
maturity
but
the
american
species
does
build
a
nest
and
rears
its
young
though
audubon
gives
it
a
bad
character
saying
it
robs
smaller
birds
of
their
eggs
it
does
not
deserve
the
censure
it
has
received
however
and
it
is
useful
in
many
ways
its
hatred
of
the
worm
is
intense
destroying
many
more
than
it
can
eat
so
thoroughly
does
it
do
its
work
that
orchards
which
three
years
ago
were
almost
leafless
the
trunks
even
being
covered
by
slippery
webbing
are
again
yielding
a
good
crop
in
september
and
october
the
cuckoo
is
silent
and
suddenly
disappears
he
seldom
sees
the
lovely
tints
of
autumn
and
never
hears
the
wintry
voice
for
impelled
by
a
resistless
impulse
he
wings
his
way
afar
over
mountain
stream
and
sea
to
a
land
where
northern
blasts
are
not
felt
and
where
a
summer
sun
is
shining
in
a
cloudless
sky

it

life
scarcely
touches
the
turf
an
instant
always
in
the
air
flying
from
flower
to
flower
it
has
their
freshness
as
well
as
their
brightness
it
lives
upon
their
nectar
and
dwells
only
in
the
climates
where
they
perennially
bloom
all
kinds
of
humming
birds
are
found
in
the
hottest
countries
of
the
new
world
they
are
quite
numerous
and
seem
to
be
confined
between
the
two
tropics
for
those
which
penetrate
the
temperate
zones
in
summer
stay
there
only
a
short
time
they
seem
to
follow
the
sun
in
its
advance
and
retreat
and
to
fly
on
the
zephyr
wing
after
an
eternal
spring
the
smaller
species
of
the
humming
birds
are
less
in
size
than
the
great
fly
wasp
and
more
slender
than
the
drone
their
beak
is
a
fine
needle
and
their
tongue
a
slender
thread
their
little
black
eyes
are
like
two
shining
points
and
the
feathers
of
their
wings
so
delicate
that
they
seem
transparent
their
short
feet
which
they
use
very
little
are
so
tiny
one
can
scarcely
see
them
they
rarely
alight
during
the
day
they
have
a
swift
continual
humming
flight
the
movement
of
their
wings
is
so
rapid
that
when
pausing
in
the
air
the
bird
seems
quite
motionless
one
sees
him
stop
before
a
blossom
then
dart
like
a
flash
to
another
visiting
all
plunging
his
tongue
into
their
hearts
flattening
them
with
his
wings
never
settling
anywhere
but
neglecting
none
he
hastens
his
inconstancies
only
to
pursue
his
loves
more
eagerly
and
to
multiply
his
innocent
joys
for
this
light
lover
of
flowers
lives
at
their
expense
without
ever
blighting
them
he
only
pumps
their
honey
and
for
this
alone
his
tongue
seems
designed
the
vivacity
of
these
small
birds
is
only
equaled
by
their
courage
or
rather
their
audacity
sometimes
they
may
be
seen
furiously
chasing
birds
twenty
times
their
size
fastening
upon
their
bodies
letting
themselves
be
carried
along
in
their
flight
while
they
peck
fiercely
until
their
tiny
rage
is
satisfied
sometimes
they
fight
each
other
vigorously
impatience
seems
their
very
essence
if
they
approach
a
blossom
and
find
it
faded
they
mark
their
spite
by
a
hasty
rending
of
the
petals
their
only
voice
is
a
weak
cry
of
frequent
and
repeated
which
they
utter
in
the
woods
from
dawn
until
at
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
they
all
take
flight
and
scatter
over
the
country
the
is
the
only
native
humming
bird
of
eastern
north
america
where
it
is
a
common
summer
resident
from
may
to
october
breeding
from
florida
to
labrador
the
nest
is
a
circle
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diameter
made
of
fern
wood
plant
down
and
so
forth
shingled
with

the

wren
all
the
children
it
seems
to
me
are
familiar
with
the
habits
of
johnny
and
jenny
wren
and
many
of
them
especially
such
as
have
had
some
experience
with
country
life
could
themselves
tell
a
story
of
these
mites
of
birds
saunders
tells
one
perhaps
you
may
think
the
wren
is
so
small
a
bird
he
can
not
sing
much
of
a
song
but
he
can
the
way
we
first
began
to
notice
him
was
by
seeing
our
pet
cat
jumping
about
the
yard
dodging
first
one
way
and
then
another
then
darting
up
a
tree
looking
surprised
and
disappointingly
jumping
down
again
pussy
had
found
a
new
for
the
little
wren
evidently
thought
it
great
fun
to
fly
down
just
in
front
of
her
and
dart
away
before
she
could
reach
him
leading
her
from
one
spot
to
another
hovering
above
her
head
chattering
to
her
all
the
time
and
at
last
flying
up
far
out
of
her
reach
this
he
repeated
day
after
day
for
some
time
seeming
to
enjoy
the
fun
of
disappointing
her
so
nicely
and
easily
but
after
a
while
the
little
fellow
thought
he
would
like
a
nearer
his
own
size
and
went
off
to
find
one
but
he
came
back
all
alone
and
perched
himself
on
the
very
of
a
on
a
high
barn
at
the
back
of
the
yard
and
there
he
would
sing
his
sweet
little
trilling
song
hour
after
hour
hardly
stopping
long
enough
to
find
food
for
his
meals
we
wondered
that
he
did
not
grow
tired
of
it
for
about
a
week
we
watched
him
closely
and
one
day
i
came
running
into
the
house
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
family
with
surprise
and
delight
that
our
little
wren
knew
what
he
was
about
for
with
his
winning
song
he
had
called
a
mate
to
him
he
led
her
to
the
tree
where
he
had
played
with
pussy
and
they
began
building
a
nest
but
pussy
watched
then
as
well
as
we
and
meant
to
have
her
revenge
upon
him
yet
so
she
sprang
into
the
tree
tore
the
nest
to
pieces
and
tried
to
catch
jenny
the
birds
rebuilt
their
nest
three
times
and
finally
we
came
to
their
rescue
and
placed
a
box
in
a
safe
place
under
the
eaves
of
the
house
and
wren
with
his
keen
shrewd
eyes
soon
saw
and
appropriated
it
there
they
stayed
and
raised
a
pretty
family
of
birdies
and
i
hope
he
taught
them
as
he
did
me
a
lesson
in
perseverance
i
never
forget

the

dear
young
folks
i
fancy
you
think
i
can
not
stop
long
enough
to
tell
you
a
story
even
about
myself
it
is
true
i
am
always
busy
with
the
flowers
drinking
their
honey
with
my
long
bill
as
you
must
be
busy
with
your
books
if
you
would
learn
what
they
teach
i
always
select
for
my
food
the
sweetest
flowers
that
grow
in
the
garden
do
you
think
you
would
be
vain
if
you
had
my
beautiful
colors
to
wear
of
course
you
would
not
but
so
many
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
have
been
destroyed
to
adorn
the
bonnets
and
headdresses
of
the
thoughtless
that
the
children
can
not
be
too
early
taught
to
love
us
too
well
to
do
us
harm
have
you
ever
seen
a
ruby
it
is
one
of
the
most
valued
of
gems
it
is
the
color
of
my
throat
and
from
its
rare
and
brilliant
beauty
i
get
a
part
of
my
name
the
ruby
is
worn
by
great
ladies
and
with
the
emerald
and
topaz
whose
bright
colors
i
also
wear
is
much
esteemed
as
an
ornament
if
you
will
come
into
the
garden
in
the
late
afternoon
between
six
and
seven
when
i
am
taking
my
supper
and
when
the
sun
is
beginning
to
close
his
great
eye
you
will
see
his
rays
shoot
sidewise
and
show
all
the
splendor
of
my
plumage
you
will
see
me
too
if
your
eyes
are
sharp
enough
draw
up
my
tiny
claws
pause
in
front
of
a
rose
and
remain
seemingly
motionless
but
listen
and
you
will
hear
the
reason
for
my
name
a
tense
humming
sound
some
call
me
a
hummer
indeed
i
spend
only
half
the
year
in
the
garden
coming
in
may
and
saying
farewell
in
october
after
my
mate
and
i
are
gone
you
may
find
our
nest
but
your
eyes
will
be
sharp
indeed
if
they
detect
it
when
the
leaves
are
on
the
trees
it
is
so
small
and
blends
with
the
branches
we
use
and
soft
down
to
build
it
and
shingle
it
with
lichens
to
match
the
branch
it
nests
upon
you
should
see
the
tiny
eggs
of
pure
white
but
we
our
nest
and
our
eggs
are
so
dainty
and
delicate
that
they
should
never
be
touched
we
are
only
to
be
looked
at
and
admired
farewell
look
for
me
when
you
go

the
house
wren
it
was
a
merry
time
when
jenny
wren
was
young
when
prettily
she
looked
and
sweetly
too
she
sung
in
looking
over
an
old
memorandum
book
the
other
day
says
walker
of
florida
i
came
across
the
following
notes
concerning
the
nesting
of
the
house
wren
i
was
sick
at
the
time
and
watched
the
whole
proceeding
from
the
laying
of
the
first
stick
to
the
conclusion
the
nest
was
placed
in
one
of
the
pigeonholes
of
my
desk
and
the
birds
effected
an
entrance
to
the
room
through
sundry
cracks
in
the
log
cabin

april

completed
and

last

may
began
sitting
may
hatching
completed
may
young
began
to
fly
may
young
left
the
nest
june
total
time
occupied
days
such
is
the
usual
time
required
for
bringing
forth
a
brood
of
this
species
of
wren
which
is
the
best
known
of
the
family
in
the
atlantic
states
it
is
more
numerous
than
in
the
far
west
where
wooded
localities
are
its
chosen
haunts
and
where
it
is
equally
at
home
in
the
cottonwoods
of
the
river
valleys
and
on
the
aspens
just
below
the
timber
line
on
lofty
mountains
osgood
wright
says
very
quaintly
that
the
house
wren
is
a
bird
who
has
allowed
the
word
to
be
obliterated
from
its
constitution
at
least
that
we
always
speak
of
jenny
wren
always
refer
to
the
wren
as
as
we
do
of
a
ship
that
it
is
johnny
wren
who
sings
and
disports
himself
generally
but
it
is
jenny
who
by
dint
of
much
scolding
and
fussing
keeps
herself
well
to
the
front
she
chooses
the
and
settles
all
the
little
domestic
details
if
johnny
does
not
like
her
choice
he
may
go
away
and
stay
away
she
will
remain
where
she
has
taken
up
her
abode
and
make
a
second
matrimonial
venture
the
house
wren
song
is
a
merry
one
sudden
abruptly
ended
and
frequently
repeated
it
is
heard
from
the
middle
of
april
to
october
and
upon
the
bird
arrival
it
at
once
sets
about
preparing
its
nest
a
loose
heap
of
sticks
with
a
soft
lining
in
holes
boxes
and
the
like
from
six
to
ten
tiny
eggs
are
laid
so
thickly
spotted
with
brown
that
the
whole
egg
is
tinged
the
house
wren
is
not
only
one
of
our
most
interesting
and
familiar
neighbors
but
it
is
useful
as
an
exterminator
of
insects
upon
which
it
feeds
frequently
it
seizes
small
butterflies
when
on
the
wing
we
have
in
mind
a
sick
child
whose
convalescence
was
hastened
and
cheered
by
the
presence
of
the
merry
house
wren
which
sings
its
sweet
little
trilling
song
hour
after
hour
hardly
stopping
long
enough
to
find
food
for
its
meals

let
them
sing
for
aye
calling
him
to
labor
at
the
break
of
day
nearly
everywhere
in
the
united
states
we
find
this
cheerful
bird
known
as
pewee
barn
pewee
bridge
pewee
or
phoebe
or
pewit
flycatcher
it
is
one
of
that
charming
coterie
of
the
feathered
tribe
who
cheer
the
abode
of
man
with
their
presence
there
are
few
farmyards
without
a
pair
of
pewees
who
do
the
farmer
much
service
by
lessening
the
number
of
flies
about
the
barn
and
by
calling
him
to
his
work
in
the
morning
by
their
cheery
notes
dr
brewer
says
that
this
species
is
attracted
both
to
the
vicinity
of
water
and
to
the
neighborhood
of
dwellings
probably
for
the
same
reason
the
abundance
of
insects
in
either
situation
they
are
a
familiar
confiding
and
gentle
bird
attached
to
localities
and
returning
to
them
year
after
year
their
nests
are
found
in
sheltered
situations
as
under
a
bridge
a
projecting
rock
in
the
porches
of
houses
etc
they
have
been
known
to
build
on
a
small
shelf
in
the
porch
of
a
dwelling
against
the
wall
of
a
railroad
station
within
reach
of
the
passengers
and
under
a
projecting
in
full
view
of
the
family
entirely
unmoved
by
the
presence
of
the
latter
at
meal
time
like
all
the
flycatcher
family
the
phoebe
takes
its
food
mostly
flying
wright
says
that
the
pewee
in
his
primitive
state
haunts
dim
woods
and
running
water
and
that
when
domesticated
he
is
a
great
bather
and
may
be
seen
in
the
dashing
in
and
out
of
the
water
as
he
makes
trips
to
and
from
the
nest
after
the
young
are
hatched
both
old
and
young
disport
themselves
about
the
water
until
moulting
time
she
advises
do
not
let
the
phoebes
build
under
the
hoods
of
your
windows
for
their
spongy
nests
harbor
innumerable
and
under
such
circumstances
your
will
become
infested
and
the
house
invaded
in
its
native
woods
the
nest
is
of
moss
mud
and
grass
placed
on
a
rock
near
and
over
running
water
but
in
the
vicinity
of
settlements
and
villages
it
is
built
on
a
horizontal
bridge
beam
or
on
timber
supporting
a
porch
or
shed
the
eggs
are
pure
white
somewhat
spotted
the
notes
to
some
ears
are
phoebe
pewit
phoebe
to
others
of
somewhat
duller
sense
of
hearing
perhaps
pewee
pewee
we
confess
to
a
fancy
that
the
latter
is
the
better
imitation
the
kinglet
baskett
says
that
the
kinglets
come
at
a
certain
early
spring
date
before
the
leaves
are
fully
expanded
and
flutter
upward
while
they
take
something
from
beneath
the
budding
leaf
or
twig
it
is
a
peculiar
motion
which
with
their
restless
ways
color
and
small
size
readily
distinguishes
them
it
is
rare
that
one
is
still
but
the
sometimes
favors
me
with
a
song
and
as
it
is
a
little
long
he
usually
is
quiet
till
done
it
is
one
of
the
sweetest
little
strains
one
day
i
saw
him
in
the
rose
bush
just
near
voluntarily
expand
the
plumage
of
his
crown
and
show
the
brilliant
feathers
beneath
usually
they
are
mostly
concealed
it
was
a
rare
treat
and
visible
to
me
only
because
of
my
rather
exalted
view
he
generally
reserves
this
display
for
his
mate
but
he
was
here
among
some
and
tree
sparrows
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
make
these
plain
folks
envious
of
the
pretty
feathers
in
his
hat
these
wonderfully
dainty
little
birds
are
of
great
value
to
the
farmer
and
the
fruit
grower
doing
good
work
among
all
classes
of
fruit
trees
by
killing
grubs
and
larvae
in
spite
of
their
value
in
this
respect
they
have
been
in
common
with
many
other
attractive
birds
recklessly
killed
for
millinery
purposes
it
is
curious
to
see
these
busy
wanderers
who
are
always
cheery
and
sociable
come
prying
and
peering
about
the
fruit
trees
examining
every
little
nook
of
possible
concealment
with
the
greatest
interest
they
do
not
stay
long
after
november
and
return
again
in
april
the
nest
of
this
kinglet
is
rarely
seen
it
is
of
matted
hair
feathers
moss
bulky
round
and
partly
hanging
until
recently
the
eggs
were
unknown
they
are
of
a
dirty
deepening
at
larger
end
to
form
a
ring
some
specimens
being
spotted
nehrling
who
has
heard
this
kinglet
sing
in
central
wisconsin
and
northern
illinois
speaks
of
the
power
purity
and
volume
of
the
notes
their
faultless
modulation
and
long
continuance
and
elliott
coues
says
of
it
the
kinglet
exquisite
vocalization
defies
description
dr
brewer
says
that
its
song
is
clear
resonant
and
high
a
prolonged
series
varying
from
the
lowest
tones
to
the
highest
and
terminating
with
the
latter
it
may
be
heard
at
quite
a
distance
and
in
some
respects
bears
more
resemblance
to
the
song
of
the
english
than
to
that
of
the
canary
to
which
audubon
compares

the
mourning
dove
dear
young
bird
lovers
most
every
person
thinks
that
while
my
actions
are
very
pretty
and
attractive
and
speak
much
in
my
favor
i
can
only
really
say
which
they
also
think
does
not
mean
anything
at
all
well
i
just
thought
i
would
undeceive
them
by
writing
you
a
letter
many
grown
up
people
fancy
that
we
birds
can
not
express
ourselves
because
we
know
very
much
of
course
there
is
a
good
reason
why
they
have
this
poor
opinion
of
us
they
are
so
busy
with
their
own
private
concerns
that
they
forget
that
there
are
little
creatures
like
ourselves
in
the
world
who
if
they
would
take
a
little
time
to
become
acquainted
with
them
would
fill
their
few
hours
of
leisure
with
a
sweeter
recreation
than
they
find
in
many
of
their
chosen
outings
a
great
english
poet
whose
writings
you
will
read
when
you
get
older
said
you
should
look
through
nature
up
to
nature
god
what
did
he
mean
i
think
he
had
us
birds
in
his
mind
for
it
is
through
a
study
of
our
habits
more
perhaps
than
that
of
the
voiceless
trees
or
the
dumb
creatures
that
roam
the
fields
that
your
hearts
are
opened
to
see
and
admire
real
beauty
we
birds
are
the
true
teachers
of
faith
hope
and
charity
faith
because
we
trust
one
another
hope
because
even
when
our
mother
nature
seems
unkind
sending
the
drifting
snow
and
the
bitter
blasts
of
winter
we
sing
a
song
of
summer
time
and
charity
because
we
are
never
fault
finders
i
believe
without
knowing
it
i
have
been
telling
you
about
myself
and
my
mate
we
doves
are
very
sincere
and
every
one
says
we
are
constant
if
you
live
in
the
country
children
you
must
often
hear
our
voices
we
are
so
tender
and
fond
of
each
other
that
we
are
looked
upon
as
models
for
children
and
even
folks
my
mate
does
not
build
a
very
nice
nest
only
uses
a
few
sticks
to
keep
the
eggs
from
falling
out
but
she
is
a
good
mother
and
nurses
the
little
ones
very
tenderly
some
people
are
so
kind
that
they
build
for
us
a
dove
cote
supply
us
with
wheat
and
corn
and
make
our
lives
as
free
from
care
and
danger
as
they
can
come
and
see
us
some
day
and
then
you
can
tell
whether
my
picture
is
a
good
one
the
artist
thinks
it
is
and
he
certainly
took
lots
of
pains
with
it
now
if
you
will
be
kind
to
all
birds
you
will
find

we
know
more
about
you
than
you
think
we
do
we
know
how
good
you
are
we
have
hopped
about
the
roofs
and
looked
in
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
you
have
built
for
poor
and
sick
and
hungry
people
and
little
lame
and
deaf

blind

we
have
built
our
nests

sung
many
a

as
we
flew
about
the

you

beautiful
for

especially
your

we
fly
a
great
way
over
the
country
keeping
all
the
time
where
the
sun
is
bright

warm
and
we
know
that
whenever
you
do
anything
the
other
people
all
over
this
great
land
between
the
seas
and
the
great
lakes
find
it
out
and
pretty
soon
will
try
to
do
the
same
we
know
we
know
we
are
americans
just
the
same
as
you
are
some
of
us
like
some
of
you
came
across
the
great
sea
but
most
of
the
birds
like
us
have
lived
here
a
long
while
and
the
birds
like
us
welcomed
your
fathers
when
they
came
here
many
many
years
ago
our
fathers
and
mothers
have
always
done
their
best
to
please
your
fathers
and
mothers
now
we
have
a
sad
story
to
tell
you
thoughtless
or
bad
people
are
trying
to
destroy
us
they
kill
us
because
our
feathers
are
beautiful
even
pretty
and
sweet
girls
who
we
should
think
would
be
our
best
friends
kill
our
brothers
and
children
so
that
they
may
wear
our
plumage
on
their
hats
sometimes
people
kill
us
for
mere
wantonness
cruel
boys
destroy
our
nests
and
steal
our
eggs
and
our
young
ones
people
with
guns
and
snares
lie
in
wait
to
kill
us
as
if
the
place
for
a
bird
were
not
in
the
sky
alive
but
in
a
shop
window
or
in
a
glass
case
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
all
our
song
birds
will
be
gone
already
we
are
told
in
some
other
countries
that
used
to
be
full
of
birds
they
are
now
almost
gone
even
the
nightingales
are
being
killed
in
italy
now
we
humbly
pray
that
you
will
stop
all
this
and
will
save
us
from
this
sad
fate
you
have
already
made
a
law
that
no
one
shall
kill
a
harmless
song
bird
or
destroy
our
nests
or
our
eggs
will
you
please
make
another
one
that
no
one
shall
wear
our
feathers
so
that
no
one
shall
kill
us
to
get
them
we
want
them
all
ourselves
your
pretty
girls
are
pretty
enough
without
them
we
are
told
that
it
is
as
easy
for
you
to
do
it
as
for
a
blackbird
to
whistle
if
you
will
we
know
how
to
pay
you
a
hundred
times
over
we
will
teach
your
children
to
keep
themselves
clean
and
neat
we
will
show
them
how
to
live
together
in

the
captive
escape
i
saw
such
a
sorrowful
sight
my
dears
such
a
sad
and
sorrowful
sight
as
i
lingered
under
the
swaying
vines
in
the
silvery
morning
light
the
skies
were
so
blue
and
the
day
was
so
fair
with
beautiful
things
untold
you
would
think
no
sad
and
sorrowful
thing
could
enter
its
heart
of
gold
a
cage
was
hanging
there
so
gay
with
turret
and
dome
you
be
sure
a
birdie
would
gladly
make
such
a
beautiful
place
its
home
but
a
wee
little
sadly
chirped
as
it
fluttered
to
and
fro
i
know
it
was
longing
with
all
its
heart
to
its
home
to
go
i
heard
a
whir
of
wings
and
an
answering
gladsome
note
as
close
to
its
nestlings
prison
bars
i
saw
the
poor
mother
bird
float
i
saw
her
flutter
and
strive
in
vain
to
open
the
prison
door
then
sadly
cling
with
drooping
wing
as
if
all
her
hopes
were
but
ere
i
could
reach
the
prison
house
and
let
its
sweet
captive
free
she
was
gone
like
a
yellow
flash
of
light
to
her
home
in
a
distant
tree
poor
birdie
i
thought
you
shall
surely
go
when
mamma
comes
back
again
for
it
hurt
me
so
that
so
small
a
thing
should
suffer
so
much
of
pain
and
back
in
a
moment
she
came
again
and
close
to
her
darling
side
with
a
drop
of
honey
dew
which
she
dropped
in
its
mouth
so
wide
then
away
with
a
strange
wild
mournful
note
of
sorrow
which
seemed
to
say
goodbye
my
darling
my
birdie
dear
goodbye
for
many
a
day
a
quick
wild
flutter
of
tiny
wings
a
faint
low
chirp
of
pain
a
throb
of
the
little
aching
heart
and
birdie
was
free
again
oh
sorrowful
anguished
was
all
that
she
could
do
she
had
set
it
free
from
a
captive
life
in
the
only
way
she
knew
poor
little
birdie
it
never
will
fly
on
tiny
and
tireless
wing
through
the
pearly
blue
of
the
summer
sky
or
sing
the
sweet
songs
of
spring
and
i
think
little
dears
if
you
had
seen
the
same
sad
sorrowful
sight
you
never
would
cage
a
free
wild
bird
to
suffer
a
captive

the
nuthatch
nearly
every
one
readily
recognizes
this
species
as
it
runs
up
and
down
and
around
the
branches
and
trunks
of
trees
in
search
of
insect
food
now
and
then
uttering
its
curious
quauk
the
nuthatch
is
often
improperly
called
sapsucker
a
name
commonly
applied
to
the
downy
woodpecker
and
others
it
is
a
common
breeding
bird
and
usually
begins
nesting
early
in
april
and
two
broods
are
frequently
reared
in
a
season
for
its
nesting
place
it
usually
selects
the
decayed
trunk
of
a
tree
or
stub
ranging
all
the
way
from
two
to
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
the
entrance
may
be
a
knot
hole
a
small
opening
or
a
small
round
hole
with
a
larger
cavity
at
the
end
of
it
often
the
old
excavation
of
the
downy
woodpecker
is
made
use
of
chicken
feathers
hair
and
a
few
dry
leaves
loosely
thrown
together
compose
the
nest
this
nuthatch
is
abundant
throughout
the
state
of
illinois
and
is
a
permanent
resident
everywhere
except
perhaps
of
the
extreme
northern
counties
it
seems
to
migrate
in
spring
and
return
in
autumn
but
in
reality
as
is
well
known
only
retreats
to
the
woodlands
to
breed
emerging
again
when
the
food
supply
grows
scant
in
the
autumn
the
nuthatches
associate
familiarly
with
the
kinglets
and
titmice
and
often
travel
with
them
though
regarded
as
shy
birds
they
are
not
really
so
their
habits
of
restlessness
render
them
difficult
of
examination
is
the
local
name
given
them
by
the
farmers
and
would
be
very
appropriate
could
they
sometimes
remain
as
motionless
as
that
diminutive
animal
careful
observation
has
disclosed
that
the
nuthatches
do
not
suck
the
sap
from
trees
but
that
they
knock
off
bits
of
decayed
or
loose
bark
with
the
beak
to
obtain
the
grubs
or
larvae
beneath
they
are
beneficial
to
vegetation
ignorance
is
responsible
for
the
misapplied
names
given
to
many
of
our
well
disposed
and
useful
birds
and
it
would
be
well
if
teachers
were
to
discourage
the
use
of
inappropriate
names
and
familiarize
the
children
with
those
recognized
by
the
best
authorities
referring
to
the
nuthatches
baskett
says
they
are
little
bluish
gray
birds
with
white
undervests
sometimes
a
little
soiled
their
tails
are
ridiculously
short
and
never
touch
the
tree
neither
does
the
body
unless
they
are
suddenly
affrighted
when
they
crouch
and
look
with
their
beaks
extended
much
like
a
knot
with
a
broken
twig
on
it
i
have
sometimes
put
the
bird
into
this
attitude
by
clapping
my
hands
loudly
near
the
window
it
is
an
impulse
that
seems
to
come
to
the
bird
before
flight
especially
if
the
head
should
be
downward
his
arrival
is
sudden
and
seems
often
to
be
distinguished
by
turning
a
somersault
before
alighting
head
downward
on
the
tree
trunk
as
if
he
had
changed
his
mind
so
suddenly
about
alighting
that
it
unbalanced
him
i
once
saw
two
nuthatches
at
what
i
then
supposed
was
a
new
habit
one
spring
day
some
gnats
were
engaged
in
their
little
crazy
love
waltzes
in
the
air
forming
small
whirling
clouds
and
the
birds
left
off
and
began
capturing
insects
on
the
wing
they
were
awkward
about
it
with
their
short
wings
and
had
to
alight
frequently
to
rest
i
went
out
to
them
and
so
absorbed
were
they
that
they
allowed
me
to
approach
within
a
yard
of
a
limb
that
they
came
to
rest
upon
where
they
would
sit
and
pant
till
they
caught
their
breath
when
they
went
at
it
again
they
seemed
fairly
to
revel
in
a
new
diet
and
a
new
exercise
