preface
this
little
book
is
not
intended
for
a
history
or
archæological
treatise
but
to
assist
those
who
visit
or
have
visited
agra
to
an
intelligent
understanding
of
one
of
the
greatest
epochs
of
indian
art
in
the
historical
part
of
it
i
have
omitted
unimportant
names
and
dates
and
only
attempted
to
give
such
a
sketch
of
the
personality
of
the
greatest
of
the
great
moguls
and
of
the
times
in
which
they
lived
as
is
necessary
for
an
appreciation
of
the
wonderful
monuments
they
left
behind
them
india
is
the
only
part
of
the
british
empire
where
art
is
still
a
living
reality
a
portion
of
the
people
spiritual
possessions
we
in
our
ignorance
and
affectation
of
superiority
make
efforts
to
improve
it
with
western
ideas
but
so
far
have
only
succeeded
in
doing
it
incalculable
harm
it
would
be
wiser
if
we
would
first
attempt
to
understand
it
among
many

which
i

historical
introduction
agra
has
two
histories
one
of
the
ancient
city
on
the
east
or
left
bank
of
the
river
jumna
going
back
so
far
as
to
be
lost
in
the
legends
of
krishna
and
of
the
heroes
of
the
mâhabhârata
the
other
of
the
modern
city
founded
by
akbar
in
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
among
muhammadans
still
retaining
its
name
of
akbarabad
which
is
intimately
associated
with
the
romance
of
the
great
moguls
and
known
throughout
the
world
as
the
city
of
the
taj
of
ancient
agra
little
now
remains
except
a
few
traces
of
the
foundations
it
was
a
place
of
importance
under
various
hindu
dynasties
previous
to
the
muhammadan
invasions
of
india
but
its
chequered
fortunes
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
are
the
usual
tale
of
siege
and
capture
by
hindu
or
mussulman
and
possess
little
historical
interest
in
sultan
sikandar
lodi
the
last
but
one
of
the
afghan
dynasty
at
delhi
rebuilt
agra
and
made
it
the
seat
of
government
sikandra
the
of
akbar
is
named
after
him
and
there
he
built
a
which
subsequently
became
the
tomb
of
mariam
zâmâni
one
of
akbar
wives
the
son
of
sultan
sikandar
ibrahim
lodi
was
defeated
and
slain
by
babar
at
panipat
near
delhi
in
and
from
that
time
agra
became
one
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
mogul
empire
which
babar
founded
the
great
i
babar
though
very
few
memorials
of
babar
short
but
brilliant
reign
still
exist
at
agra
the
life
of
this
remarkable
man
is
so
important
a
part
of
the
mogul
dynasty
that
it
must
not
be
passed
over
by
the
intelligent
tourist
or
student
of
mogul
art
it
was
babar
sunny
disposition
and
the
love
of
nature
characteristic
of
his
race
that
brought
back
into
indian
art
the
note
of
joyousness
which
it
had
not
known
since
the
days
of
buddhism
babar
is
one
of
the
most
striking
figures
in
eastern
history
he
was
descended
from
tamerlane
or
timur
on
his
father
side
and
on
his
mother
from
chinghiz
khan
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
became
king
of
farghana
a
small
kingdom
of
central
asia
now
known
as
kokand
his
sovereignty
however
was
of
a
very
precarious
tenure
for
he
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
horde
of
rapacious
intriguing
relatives
scrambling
for
the
fragments
of
timur
empire
with
hardly
a
trustworthy
ally
except
a
remarkably
clever
and
courageous
old
grandmother
he
struggled
for
three
years
to
retain
his
birthright
then
acting
on
a
sudden
inspiration
he
made
a
dash
for
samarkand
the
ancient
capital
of
timur
and
won
it
in
his
delightful
memoirs
babar
describes
how
with
boyish
glee
he
paced
the
ramparts
himself
wandered
from
palace
to
palace
and
revelled
in
the
of
what
was
then
one
of
the
finest
cities
of
asia
but
in
less
than
a
hundred
days
most
of
his
shifty
mongol
troops
disappointed
in
not
finding
as
much
booty
as
they
expected
deserted
and
joined
a
party
of
his
enemies
who
straightway
attacked
andijan
the
capital
of
farghana
where
babar
had
left
his
mother
and
grandmother
before
he
could
come
to
their
rescue
andijan
had
fallen
and
at
the
same
time
samarkand
which
he
had
left
was
occupied
by
another
of
his
numerous
rivals
this
double
misfortune
caused
still
more
of
his
followers
to
leave
him
and
he
found
himself
without
a
kingdom
except
the
little
town
of
khojend
and
with
only
two
hundred
men
for
almost
the
only
time
in
his
life
he
gave
way
utterly
to
despair
i
became
a
prey
to
melancholy
and
vexation
i
was
reduced
to
a
sore
distressed
state
and
wept
much
before
long
however
babar
rejoined
by
his
mother
and
grandmother
whom
the
captors
of
andijan
had
spared
taking
advantage
of
another
turn
in
the
wheel
of
fortune
recovered
his
kingdom
of
farghana
but
lost
the
greater
part
of
it
again
through
another
desertion
of
his
mongol
rascals
a
second
time
with
only
a
handful
of
men
he
surprised
and
captured
samarkand
in
the
following
year
he
rashly
sallied
out
against
shaibani
the
most
formidable
of
his
adversaries
was
defeated
and
after
vainly
trying
to
hold
the
city
against
the
victors
was
forced
to
fly
under
cover
of
the
night
this
time
he
did
not
weep
but
consoled
himself
next
morning
by
riding
a
headlong
race
with
two
of
his
companions
reaching
a
village
where
they
found
nice
fat
flesh
bread
of
fine
flour
well
baked
sweet
melons
and
excellent
grapes
in
great
abundance
babar
declared
that
in
all
his
life
he
never
enjoyed
himself
so
much
or
felt
so
keenly
the
pleasures
of
peace
and
plenty
he
now
took
refuge
among
the
hills
near
uratipa
finding
amusement
in
observing
the
life
of
the
villagers
and
especially
in
conversing
with
the
mother
of
the
headman
an
old
lady
of
a
hundred
and
eleven
whose
descendants
to
the
number
of
lived
in
the
country
round
about
one
of
her
relatives
had
served
in
the
army
with
which
timur
had
invaded
india
and
she
entertained
the
future
emperor
of
hindustan
by
telling
him
stories
of
his
ancestor
adventures
after
several
fruitless
raids
with
the
few
troopers
who
remained
faithful
to
him
he
allied
himself
with
his
two
uncles
mahmud
and
ahmad
khan
in
an
attack
against
tambal
one
of
the
powerful
nobles
who
had
revolted
against
him
and
set
up
jahangir
his
brother
on
the
throne
of
farghana
at
a
critical
moment
his
uncles
left
babar
to
the
mercy
of
his
enemy
and
he
was
again
forced
to
fly
for
his
life
hotly
pursued
by
tambal
horsemen
he
was
overtaken
by
two
of
them
who
not
daring
to
pit
themselves
against
babar
prodigious
strength
and
courage
tried
to
inveigle
him
into
a
trap
babar
gives
a
moving
description
of
this
great
crisis
in
his
life
thoroughly
exhausted
and
seeing
no
prospect
of
escape
he
resigned
himself
to
die
there
was
a
stream
in
the
garden
and
there
i
made
my
ablutions
and
recited
a
prayer
of
two
bowings
then
surrendering
myself
to
meditation
i
was
about
to
ask
god
for
his
compassion
when
sleep
closed
my
eyes
i
saw
in
my
dream
khwája
yakub
the
son
of
khwája
yahya
and
grandson
of
his
eminence
the
khwája
a
famous
saint
of
samarkand
with
a
numerous
escort
mounted
on
dappled
grey
horses
come
before
me
and
say
not
be
anxious
the
khwája
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
that
he
will
support
you
and
seat
you
on
the
throne
of
sovereignty
whenever
a
difficulty
occurs
to
you
remember
to
beg
his
help
and
he
will
at
once
respond
to
your
appeal
and
victory
and
triumph
shall
straightway
lean
to
your
i
awoke
with
easy
heart
at
the
very
moment
when
yusuf
the
constable
and
his
companions
tambal
soldiers
were
plotting
some
trick
to
seize
and
throttle
me
hearing
them
discussing
it
i
said
to
them
you
say
is
very
well
but
i
shall
be
curious
to
see
which
of
you
dares
to
approach
me
as
i
spoke
the
tramp
of
a
number
of
horses
was
heard
outside
the
garden
wall
yusuf
the
constable
exclaimed
we
had
taken
you
and
brought
you
to
tambal
our
affairs
would
have
prospered
much
thereby
as
it
is
he
has
sent
a
large
troop
to
seize
you
and
the
noise
you
hear
is
the
tramp
of
horses
on
your
track
at
this
assertion
my
face
fell
and
i
knew
not
what
to
devise
at
this
very
moment
the
horsemen
who
had
not
at
first
found
the
gate
of
the
garden
made
a
breach
in
its
crumbling
wall
through
which
they
entered
i
saw
they
were
kutluk
muhammad
barlas
and
babai
pargári
two
of
my
most
devoted
followers
with
ten
or
twenty
other
persons
when
they
came
near
to
my
person
they
threw
themselves
off
their
horses
and
bending
the
knee
at
a
respectful
distance
fell
at
my
feet
and
overwhelmed
me
with
marks
of
their
affection
amazed
at
this
apparition
i
felt
that
god
had
just
restored
me
to
life
i
called
to
them
at
once
yusuf
the
constable
and
the
wretched
traitors
who
are
with
him
and
bring
them
to
me
bound
hand
and
foot
then
turning
to
my
rescuers
i
said
come
you
who
told
you
what
was
happening
kutluk
muhammad
barlás
answered
i
found
myself
separated
from
you
in
the
sudden
flight
from
akhsi
i
reached
andijan
at
the
very
moment
when
the
khans
themselves
were
making
their
entry
there
i
saw
in
a
dream
khwája
who
said
babar
is
at
this
instant
in
a
village
called
karmán
fly
thither
and
bring
him
back
with
you
for
the
throne
is
his
of
rejoicing
at
this
dream
i
related
it
to
the
big
khan
and
little
khan
three
days
have
we
been
marching
and
thanks
be
to
god
for
bringing
about
this
meeting
after
this
exciting
adventure
babar
rejoined
his
uncles
but
was
forced
into
exile
again
in
when
at
the
battle
of
akshi
the
khans
were
completely
defeated
by
shaibani
then
he
resolved
to
depart
out
of
farghana
and
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
recover
his
kingdom
characteristically
when
foiled
in
one
enterprise
he
entered
upon
another
yet
more
ambitious
joined
by
his
two
brothers
jahangir
and
nasir
and
by
a
motley
array
of
various
wandering
tribes
he
swooped
down
upon
kabul
and
captured
it
the
description
of
the
new
kingdom
thus
easily
won
which
fills
many
pages
of
the
memoirs
reveals
another
side
of
babar
character
his
intense
love
of
nature
he
gives
minute
accounts
of
the
climate
physical
characteristics
the
fruits
flowers
birds
and
beasts
as
well
as
of
the
human
inhabitants
in
the
intervals
between
his
battles
or
between
his
rollicking
drinking
parties
which
for
some
years
of
his
life
degenerated
into
drunken
orgies
we
often
find
babar
lost
in
admiration
of
some
beautiful
landscape
or
collecting
flowers
and
planting
fruit
trees
wherever
he
came
babar
first
care
was
to
dig
wells
and
plant
fruit
and
flower
gardens
india
owes
much
to
the
great
moguls
love
of
horticulture
when
babar
had
drilled
his
unruly
afghan
subjects
into
something
like
order
he
made
in
one
more
unsuccessful
attempt
to
crush
shaibani
however
in
when
that
doughty
warrior
was
defeated
and
slain
by
ismail
shah
of
persia
samarkand
fell
once
more
into
hands
as
a
vassal
of
the
shah
eight
months
afterwards
he
was
driven
out
again
from
that
time
babar
gave
up
all
hopes
of
the
empire
of
his
ancestor
timur
and
turned
his
face
towards
india
in
he
gathered
an
army
for
his
first
expedition
which
was
however
more
of
a
reconnaissance
than
a
conquest
four
more
attempts
he
made
until
at
last
in
with
only
men
he
defeated
the
hosts
of
ibrahim
lodi
the
last
of
the
afghan
kings
of
delhi
who
with
of
his
troops
were
left
dead
on
the
field
of
panipat
thus
after
many
struggles
babar
became
master
and
conqueror
of
the
mighty
empire
of
hindustan
but
he
had
to
fight
two
more
great
battles
before
his
sovereignty
was
undisputed
one
in
near
fatehpur
sikri
with
the
great
chief
of
the
rajputs
raja
sanga
of
chitore
and
another
in
near
buxar
with
the
afghans
who
had
settled
in
bengal
the
next
year
babar
died
in
his
garden
palace
at
agra
the
nobility
of
his
character
was
conspicuous
in
his
death
as
it
was
in
his
life
he
was
devotedly
attached
to
his
eldest
son
humayun
who
was
seized
with
malarial
fever
while
staying
at
his
country
estate
at
sambhal
babar
had
him
removed
by
boat
to
agra
but
his
physicians
declared
that
the
case
was
hopeless
babar
own
health
had
suffered
much
during
his
life
in
india
and
he
was
terribly
agitated
by
the
news
when
some
one
suggested
that
in
such
circumstances
the
almighty
sometimes
deigned
to
accept
the
thing
most
valued
by
one
friend
in
exchange
for
the
life
of
another
babar
exclaimed
that
of
all
things
his
life
was
dearest
to
humayun
as
humayun
was
to
him
he
would
sacrifice
his
own
life
to
save
his
son
his
courtiers
entreated
him
to
give
up
instead
the
great
diamond
taken
at
agra
said
to
be
the
most
valuable
on
earth
babar
declared
that
no
stone
could
compare
in
value
with
his
own
life
and
after
solemnly
walking
round
humayun
couch
as
in
a
religious
sacrifice
he
retired
to
devote
himself
to
prayer
soon
afterwards
he
was
heard
to
exclaim
i
have
borne
it
away
i
have
borne
it
away
humayun
began
to
recover
and
as
he
improved
babar
gradually
sank
commending
his
son
to
the
protection
of
his
friends
and
imploring
humayun
to
be
kind
and
forgiving
to
his
brothers
the
first
of
the
great
moguls
of
india
passed
away
he
was
buried
at
kabul
in
one
of
his
beloved
gardens
which
according
to
tartar
custom
he
had
chosen
for
his
tomb
in
the
sweetest
spot
of
the
neighbourhood
babar
connection
with
agra
babar
connection
with
agra
began
immediately
after
the
battle
of
panipat
he
sent
forward
humayun
who
occupied
the
town
without
opposition
the
story
of
the
great
diamond
referred
to
above
is
here
recorded
in
the
memoirs
the
raja
of
gwalior
slain
at
panipat
had
left
his
family
and
the
heads
of
his
clan
at
agra
in
gratitude
to
humayun
who
treated
them
magnanimously
and
protected
them
from
plunder
they
presented
to
him
a
or
token
of
homage
consisting
of
a
quantity
of
jewels
and
precious
stones
among
these
was
one
famous
diamond
which
had
been
acquired
by
sultan
alaeddin
it
is
so
valuable
that
a
judge
of
diamonds
valued
it
at
about
half
the
daily
expense
of
the
whole
world
it
is
about
eight
or
about
carats
this
is
generally
supposed
to
be
the
celebrated
babar
determined
to
establish
the
seat
of
his
government
at
agra
but
was
almost
dissuaded
by
the
desolate
appearance
of
the
country
it
always
appears
to
me
he
says
that
one
of
the
chief
defects
of
hindustan
is
the
want
of
artificial
watercourses
i
had
intended
wherever
i
might
fix
my
residence
to
construct
to
produce
an
artificial
stream
and
to
lay
out
an
elegant
and
regularly
planned
pleasure
ground
shortly
after
coming
to
agra
i
passed
the
jumna
with
this
object
in
view
and
examined
the
country
to
pitch
upon
a
fit
spot
for
a
garden
the
whole
was
so
ugly
and
detestable
that
i
repassed
the
river
quite
repulsed
and
disgusted
in
consequence
of
the
want
of
beauty
and
of
the
disagreeable
aspect
of
the
country
i
gave
up
my
intention
of
making
a
garden
house
but
as
no
better
situation
presented
itself
near
agra
i
was
finally
compelled
to
make
the
best
of
this
same
spot
in
every
corner
i
planted
suitable
gardens
in
every
garden
i
sowed
roses
and
narcissus
regularly
and
in
beds
corresponding
to
each
other
we
were
annoyed
by
three
things
in
hindustan
one
was
its
heat
another
the
strong
winds
and
the
third
its
dust
baths
were
the
means
of
removing
all
three
inconveniences
as
i
have
mentioned
above
there
are
very
few
vestiges
remaining
of
babar
city
of
his
fruit
and
flower
gardens
palaces
baths
tanks
wells
and
watercourses
the
ram
bagh
is
one
of
the
gardens
laid
out
either
by
himself
or
by
one
of
his
nobles
and
the
zohra
or
zuhara
bagh
near
it
contains
the
remains
of
a
which
is
said
to
have
belonged
to
one
of
babar
daughters
opposite
to
the
taj
there
are
traces
of
the
foundations
of
the
city
he
built
babar
planned
and
his
successors
completed
the
great
road
leading
from
agra
to
kabul
through
lahore
parts
of
which
still
remain
some
of
the
old
milestones
can
be
seen
on
the
road
to
sikandra
babar
account
of
the
commencement
of
it
is
very
characteristic
on
thursday
the
of
the
latter
rebia
i
directed
chikmak
bey
by
a
writing
under
the
royal
hand
and
seal
to
measure
the
distance
from
agra
to
kabul
that
at
every
nine
he
should
raise
a
or
turret
twelve
in
height
on
the
top
of
which
he
was
to
construct
a
pavilion
that
every
ten
he
should
erect
a
or
which
they
call
a
for
six
horses
that
he
should
fix
a
certain
allowance
as
a
provision
for
the
keepers
couriers
and
grooms
and
for
feeding
the
horses
and
orders
were
given
that
whenever
a
for
horses
was
built
near
a
or
imperial
demesne
they
should
be
furnished
from
thence
with
the
stated
allowances
that
if
it
were
situated
in
a
the
nobleman
in
charge
should
attend
to
the
supply
the
same
day
chikmâk
padshahi
left
agra
the
promptness
of
babar
administrative
methods
is
a
striking
contrast
to
the
circumlocution
of
departmentalism
there
still
exist
remains
of
many
splendid
or
built
along
this
road
by
different
mogul
emperors
for
their
convenience
from
the
time
of
babar
down
to
aurangzîb
one
of
the
finest
is
the
nurmahal
sarai
near
jalandhar
built
by
jahangir
and
named
after
his
favourite
wife
edward
terry
who
accompanied
sir
thomas
roe
james
the
first
ambassador
at
jahangir
court
describes
the
long
walk
of
four
hundred
miles
shaded
by
great
trees
on
both
sides
and
adds
this
is
looked
upon
by
the
travellers
who
have
found
the
comfort
of
that
cool
shade
as
one
of
the
rarest
and
most
beneficial
works
in
the
whole
world
ii
humayun
humayun
who
succeeded
babar
had
many
of
his
father
amiable
qualities
but
none
of
his
genius
as
a
leader
of
men
he
utterly
failed
in
the
attempt
to
consolidate
the
great
empire
which
babar
had
left
him
and
in
or
nine
and
a
half
years
after
his
accession
he
was
completely
defeated
at
kanauj
by
shere
khan
sur
an
afghan
nobleman
who
had
submitted
to
babar
but
revolted
against
his
son
humayun
found
himself
a
fugitive
with
only
a
handful
of
men
and
was
eventually
driven
not
only
out
of
hindustan
but
even
from
the
kingdom
of
kabul
he
then
took
refuge
with
the
shah
of
persia
shere
khan
sur
under
the
title
of
shere
shah
ruled
at
agra
until
he
died
five
years
afterwards
his
son
salîm
shah
or
sultan
islam
succeeded
him
and
reigned
between
seven
and
eight
years
but
on
his
death
the
usual
quarrels
between
his
relatives
and
generals
gave
humayun
who
in
the
mean
time
had
got
back
kabul
with
the
aid
of
a
persian
army
the
opportunity
to
recover
his
position
in
hindustan
this
occurred
in
but
humayun
unfortunate
reign
terminated
the
same
year
through
a
fatal
fall
from
a
staircase
in
his
palace
at
delhi
humayun
left
no
memorial
of
himself
at
agra
but
he
is
to
be
remembered
for
two
circumstances
the
first
that
he
was
the
father
of
the
great
akbar
who
succeeded
him
and
the
second
that
the
plan
of
his
tomb
at
delhi
built
by
akbar
was
the
model
on
which
the
plan
of
the
taj
was
based
interregnum
shere
shah
shere
shah
was
a
great
builder
and
a
most
capable
ruler
in
his
short
reign
of
five
years
he
initiated
many
of
the
great
administrative
reforms
which
akbar
afterwards
perfected
fergusson
in
his
history
of
indian
architecture
mentions
that
in
his
time
there
was
a
fragment
of
a
palace
built
by
shere
shah
in
the
fort
at
agra
which
was
as
exquisite
a
piece
of
decorative
art
as
any
of
its
class
in
india
this
palace
has
since
been
destroyed
to
make
room
for
a
barrack
but
probably
the
pavilion
known
as
the
salîmgarh
is
the
fragment
to
which
fergusson
refers
the
only
other
building
of
shere
shah
time
now
remaining
in
agra
is
the
mosque
of
alawal
bilawal
or
shah
wilayat
in
the
quarter
see
shere
shah
tomb
at
sasseram
in
bihar
is
one
of
the
noblest
monuments
of
the
pathan
style
or
the
style
of
the
earliest
muhammadan
architects
in
india
iii
akbar
akbar
the
great
was
born
at
amarkot
on
the
edge
of
the
deserts
of
marwar
about
three
years
after
the
battle
of
kanauj
when
his
father
humayun
was
a
fugitive
driven
from
place
to
place
by
the
adherents
of
shere
shah
at
this
time
the
treasury
of
the
royal
house
was
so
reduced
that
when
humayun
indented
on
it
for
the
customary
presents
to
his
faithful
followers
the
only
thing
procurable
was
a
single
pod
of
musk
with
the
cheerfulness
which
was
the
saving
grace
of
humayun
he
broke
up
the
pod
and
distributed
it
adding
the
pious
wish
which
seemed
like
prophetic
insight
that
his
son
fame
might
fill
the
world
like
the
fragrance
of
that
perfume
trained
in
the
hard
school
of
adversity
and
inheriting
the
best
qualities
of
his
grandfather
akbar
was
not
long
in
restoring
the
faded
fortunes
of
the
mogul
dynasty
like
babar
he
succeeded
to
the
throne
at
a
very
early
age
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
difficulties
which
would
have
overwhelmed
a
weaker
character
humayun
had
indeed
fought
his
way
back
to
delhi
and
agra
but
he
had
by
no
means
settled
with
all
the
numerous
disputants
for
the
sovereignty
of
hindustan
which
sultan
islam
death
had
left
in
the
field
and
his
departure
from
kabul
had
been
the
signal
for
revolt
in
that
quarter
akbar
accompanied
by
bairam
khan
the
ablest
of
humayun
generals
was
in
sind
when
he
received
at
the
same
time
the
news
of
his
father
death
and
of
the
revolt
of
the
viceroy
at
kabul
he
was
then
little
more
than
thirteen
years
old
but
like
babar
under
similar
circumstances
he
was
prompt
in
decision
and
in
action
adopting
bairam
advice
which
was
contrary
to
that
of
all
his
other
counsellors
he
left
kabul
out
of
account
and
pushed
on
to
delhi
against
the
forces
of
himu
a
hindu
general
and
the
most
powerful
of
his
foes
who
had
assumed
the
title
of
raja
bikramajit
with
the
hopes
of
restoring
the
old
hindu
dynasty
on
the
historic
plains
of
panipat
akbar
completely
defeated
himu
army
and
thus
regained
the
empire
which
his
grandfather
had
won
on
the
same
field
thirty
years
before
this
great
battle
was
the
most
critical
point
in
his
career
and
though
akbar
had
to
undertake
many
other
hard
campaigns
before
he
was
absolute
master
of
the
empire
his
position
from
that
time
was
never
seriously
endangered
until
his
eighteenth
year
akbar
remained
under
the
tutelage
of
bairam
an
able
general
but
unscrupulous
and
cruel
the
generous
disposition
of
akbar
revolted
against
some
of
his
guardian
methods
but
he
recognized
that
for
some
years
at
least
bairam
experience
was
necessary
for
him
in
however
he
took
the
administration
entirely
into
his
own
hands
bairam
in
disgust
took
up
arms
against
his
young
master
but
was
soon
defeated
and
taken
prisoner
with
his
usual
magnanimity
akbar
pardoned
him
and
sent
him
off
to
mecca
with
a
munificent
present
but
the
revengeful
knife
of
an
afghan
put
an
end
to
the
turbulent
nobleman
life
before
he
could
leave
india
akbar
spent
the
rest
of
his
long
reign
in
elaborating
the
administrative
reforms
which
have
made
him
famous
as
the
greatest
ruler
india
has
ever
had
with
the
aid
of
able
ministers
both
hindu
and
muhammadan
he
purified
the
administration
of
justice
keeping
the
supreme
control
in
his
own
hands
enjoined
absolute
tolerance
in
religious
matters
abolished
oppressive
taxes
and
reorganized
and
improved
the
system
of
land
revenue
introduced
by
shere
shah
a
minute
account
of
akbar
reign
of
his
policy
habits
and
character
is
given
in
the
the
history
written
by
his
devoted
friend
and
prime
minister
abul
fazl
no
detail
of
state
affairs
was
too
small
for
akbar
personal
attention
ability
and
integrity
were
the
only
passports
to
his
favour
while
bigotry
and
injustice
were
anathemas
to
him
like
babar
he
was
fond
of
horticulture
and
imported
many
kinds
of
fruit
trees
and
flowers
into
india
though
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
had
a
great
library
of
hindi
persian
arabic
greek
and
other
books
and
abul
fazl
relates
that
every
book
was
read
through
to
him
from
beginning
to
end
the
most
remarkable
of
all
this
remarkable
man
intellectual
activities
were
his
attempts
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
of
all
the
discordant
religious
elements
of
his
empire
badâyuni
one
of
his
contemporary
historians
but
unlike
him
a
bigoted
musalman
comments
thus
on
akbar
religious
views
from
his
earliest
childhood
to
his
manhood
and
from
his
manhood
to
old
age
his
majesty
has
passed
through
the
most
various
phases
and
through
all
sorts
of
religious
practices
and
sectarian
beliefs
and
has
collected
everything
which
people
can
find
in
books
with
a
talent
of
selection
peculiar
to
him
and
a
spirit
of
inquiry
opposed
to
every
islamite
principle
thus
a
faith
based
on
some
elementary
principles
traced
itself
on
the
mirror
of
his
heart
and
as
the
result
of
all
the
influences
which
were
brought
to
bear
on
his
majesty
there
grew
gradually
as
the
outline
on
a
stone
the
conviction
on
his
heart
that
there
were
sensible
men
in
all
religions
and
abstemious
thinkers
and
men
endowed
with
miraculous
powers
among
all
nations
if
some
true
knowledge
were
thus
everywhere
to
be
found
why
should
truth
be
confined
to
one
religion
or
to
a
creed
like
islam
which
was
comparatively
new
and
scarcely
a
thousand
years
old
why
should
one
sect
assert
what
another
denies
and
why
should
one
claim
a
preference
without
having
superiority
conferred
upon
itself
near
to
his
palace
at
fatehpur
sikri
he
built
an
ibâdat
khana
or
hall
of
worship
for
the
discussion
of
philosophy
and
religion
there
he
received
representatives
of
all
religious
sects
muhammadans
brahmans
jains
buddhists
parsis
jews
and
christians
and
listened
attentively
to
their
arguments
he
studied
deeply
religious
books
and
had
the
new
testament
translated
into
persian
he
also
invited
jesuit
priests
from
goa
and
not
only
allowed
them
to
build
a
church
at
agra
but
even
attended
a
marriage
service
and
interpreted
the
words
of
the
sermon
to
the
bride
badayuni
says
that
his
majesty
firmly
believed
in
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
and
wishing
to
spread
the
doctrines
of
jesus
ordered
prince
murad
his
son
to
take
a
few
lessons
in
christianity
by
way
of
auspiciousness
the
jesuits
however
did
not
succeed
in
making
akbar
a
convert
for
when
his
religious
convictions
were
at
last
settled
he
proclaimed
as
the
state
religion
a
kind
of
eclectic
pantheism
called
or
divine
faith
with
himself
as
the
chief
interpreter
dispensing
with
all
forms
of
priesthood
he
simply
recognized
one
god
the
maker
of
the
universe
and
himself
as
god
vicegerent
on
earth
he
rejected
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
and
accepted
that
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
the
islamite
prayers
were
abolished
and
others
of
a
more
general
character
were
substituted
for
them
the
ceremonial
was
largely
borrowed
from
the
hindus
the
divine
faith
had
no
hold
on
the
people
and
its
influence
ceased
with
the
death
of
its
founder
it
is
even
said
that
akbar
on
his
acknowledged
the
orthodox
muhammadan
creed
but
the
evidence
on
this
point
is
unreliable
akbar
religious
system
had
an
important
political
bearing
for
the
keynote
of
his
whole
policy
was
the
endeavour
to
unite
with
a
bond
of
common
interest
all
the
diverse
social
religious
and
racial
elements
of
his
empire
he
overlooked
nothing
which
might
further
the
object
he
had
in
view
he
chose
his
ministers
and
generals
indiscriminately
from
all
his
subjects
without
distinction
of
race
or

salîm
he
had
instigated
the
assassination
of
the

probably
hastened
his
own
father
death
by
his
violent
conduct
there
was
however
a
reconciliation
at
the
end
and
jahangir
endeavoured
to
atone
for
his
behaviour
by
lavish
expenditure
on
akbar

at

he
has
also
left
many
pious
tributes
to
his

jahangir
favourite
wife
was
the
celebrated
nur

who
for
twenty
years
was
almost
the
supreme
power
in

her
beauty
attracted
his
attention

he
was

removed
to

and
placed
under
the
care
of
his

for
many
years
she
repulsed
all
jahangir
overtures
but
when
at
last
she
consented
to
be
his
queen
she
became
his
most
devoted
wife
she
accompanied
him
on
all
his
travels
and
jahangir
consulted
her
in
all
important
affairs

taking
his

for
an

in

the

himself
being
her
carter
he
affectionately
changed
her
name
from
nur

of
the

to
nur

light
of
the

the
imperial

has
acquired
a
new
value
since
it
bore
the

she
even
succeeded
to
some
extent
in
controlling
jahangir
drunken
habits
she
was
a
great
patroness
of
the
arts
and
it
is
said
that
the

her
apartments
in
the
agra

was
decorated
after
her

designs
her
charity
was
boundless
she
was

the
magnificent

at

known
by
his

during

reign
many
europeans
travellers
adventurers
and
others
flocked
to
the
mogul
court
they
were
allowed
free
access
to
the
palace
and
jahangir
frequently
admitted
them
to
join
in
his
midnight
carouses
he
showed
great
favour
to
the
jesuit
priests
and
even
allowed
two
of
his
nephews
to
be
instructed
in
the
christian
religion
the
violent
temper
of
jahangir
was
inherited
by
his
son
prince
khurram
afterwards
shah
jahan
and
the
peace
of
his
reign
was
frequently
disturbed
by
open
rebellion
on
the
part
of
the
prince
in
shah
jahan
actually
sacked
agra
and
his
soldiers
committed
fearful
atrocities
on
the
inhabitants
he
failed
however
to
capture
the
fort
which
contained
the
imperial
treasury
and
jahangir
no
doubt
remembering
his
own
father
leniency
towards
himself
forgave
his
unruly
son
jahangir
died
in
and
was
buried
at
shahdara
near
lahore
in
a
magnificent
tomb
prepared
by

she
herself
retired
to
lahore
and
though
she
lived

ceased
to

after

of

tomb
already
mentioned
part
of

the

named
after
him
though
it
is
most
probable
that
it
was
really
built
in
akbar

there
are
a
few
minor
buildings
of
jahangir

in

such
as
the

of

the

shah
jahan
on
his
father
death
though
only
fourth
in
right
of
succession
to
the
throne
speedily
disposed
of
his
brothers
by
means
very
commonly
adopted
in
oriental
royal
families
and
was
enthroned
at
agra
in
immediately
afterwards
he
wreaked
his
vengeance
on
the
portuguese
who
had
taken
part
against
him
in
his
rebellion
against
jahangir
by
destroying
their
settlement
at
hughli
the
next
year
while
on
an
expedition
to
suppress
disorder
in
the
deccan
he
lost
his
favourite
wife
mumtaz
mahal
the
lady
of
the
taj
for
a
long
time
the
emperor
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
grief
and
he
remained
faithful
to
her
memory
until
his
death
the
actual
building
of
the
taj
commenced
in
from
this
date
until
when
aurangzîb
usurped
the
throne
was
the
most
magnificent
period
of
the
mogul
dynasty
the
whole
empire
enjoyed
comparative
peace
and
prosperity
shah
jahan
just
and
liberal
government
continued
his
father
and
grandfather
policy
of
tolerance
towards
the
hindus
and
his
administration
though
conducted
with
great
pomp
and
splendour
did
not
press
hardly
upon
the
people
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
epochs
of
indian
architecture
besides
the
taj
mahal
the
buildings
erected
during
these
years
include
four
of
the
masterpieces
of

the
jâmi

cathedral
mosque
of

the
mûti
masjid
or

mosque
of
agra
part
of
the
agra
palace
and
the
great
palace
at
delhi
of
which
only
a
small
portion
now
exists
it
is
said
that
as
shah
jahan
advanced
towards
old
age
he
abandoned
himself
more
and
more
to
a
life
of
pleasure
and
but
his
last
years
were
darkened
by
the
same
kind
of
family
intrigues
through
which
he
himself
had
gained
the
throne
in
the
serious
illness
of
the
emperor
brought
these
intrigues
to
a
head
his
eldest
son
by
mumtaz
mahal
called
dara
shikoh
a
gracious
and
generous
prince
but
headstrong
and
intolerant
of
advice
was
appointed
regent
on
receiving
this
intelligence
his
younger
brothers
shuja
viceroy
of
bengal
and
murad
viceroy
of
gujarat
declared
their
independence
and
marched
upon
agra
aurangzîb
the
third
son
a
religious
bigot
but
the
ablest
and
most
virile
of
the
brothers
hastened
to
join
them
and
being
placed
in
chief
command
attacked
dara
army
close
to
agra
and
completely
defeated
him
three
days
afterwards
he
entered
the
city
shah
jahan
sent
his
chamberlain
to
order
him
to
leave
the
city
at
once
and
return
to
his
post
in
the
deccan
but
aurangzîb
affecting
to
believe
that
his
father
was
dead
disregarded
the
order
he
succeeded
by
bribes
and
promises
in
bringing
over
some
of
the
principal
nobles
to
his
side
and
being
well
informed
by
rushanara
his
younger
sister
who
was
his
equal
in
cunning
and
artifice
of
all
that
went
on
in
the
palace
he
baffled
shah
attempts
to
lay
hands
on
him
at
last
under
pretence
of
arranging
an
amicable
meeting
with
his
son
mahmud
aurangzîb
beguiled
shah
jahan
into
withdrawing
his
troops
from
the
fort
mahmud
immediately
forced
his
way
in
with
a
picked
body
of
men
and
seized
the
person
of
the
emperor
the
plan
succeeded
so
well
that
no
attempt
at
a
rescue
was
made
the
french
traveller
tavernier
who
has
left
a
complete
record
of
the
time
writes
of
this
event
it
is
most
surprising
that
not
one
of
the
servants
of
the
grand
king
offered
to
assist
him
that
all
his
subjects
abandoned
him
and
that
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
rising
sun
recognizing
no
one
as
king
but
aurangzîb
shah
jahan
though
still
living
passed
from
their
memories
if
perchance
there
were
any
who
felt
touched
by
his
misfortunes
fear
made
them
silent
and
made
them
basely
abandon
a
king
who
had
governed
them
like
a
father
and
with
a
mildness
which
is
not
common
with
sovereigns
for
although
he
was
severe
enough
to
the
nobles
when
they
failed
to
perform
their
duties
he
arranged
all
things
for
the
comfort
of
the
people
by
whom
he
was
much
beloved
but
who
gave
no
signs
of
it
at
this
crisis
shah
jahan
remained
confined
in
a
set
of
apartments
of
the
agra
palace
for
seven
years
he
died
in
and
was
buried
by
the
side
of
mumtaz
mahal
in
the
taj
his
captivity
was
shared
by
his
favourite
daughter
jahanara
who
since
the
death
of
her
mother
had
ruled
the
imperial
household
and
taken
a
prominent
part
in
state
affairs
she
had
actively
supported
the
cause
of
dara
and
thus
incurred
the
resentment
of
aurangzîb
on
her
father
death
she
retired
to
delhi
and
she
lived
there
until
her
simple
grave
covered
with
grass
is
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
courtyard
of
nizamudin
tomb
near
delhi
where
the
memory
of
her
filial
piety
adds
to
the
poetic
charm
of
all
the
surroundings
the
monuments
of
shah
jahan
reign
at

the

after

the
court
was
removed
to

was
left
with
only
a
provincial
governor
to
maintain
its
former
magnificence
the
unhappy
dara
after
his
defeat
by
aurangzîb
made
fruitless
attempts
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
but
was
at
last
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
his
brother
who
immediately
put
him
to
death
aurangzîb
lost
no
time
in
disposing
of
his
other

placed

imagination
to
its
utmost
limits
and
you
can
conceive
no
exhibition
more
grand
and
imposing
than
when
mounted
on
a
stupendous
pegu
elephant
and
seated
in
a
blazing
with
gold
and
azure
is
followed
by
five
or
six
other
elephants

nearly
as
resplendent
as

own
and
filled
with
ladies
attached
to
her
household
close
to
the

the
chief
eunuchs
richly
adorned
and
finely
mounted
each
with
a
wand
of
office
in
his
hand
and
surrounding
her
elephant
a
troop
of
female
servants
and
fantastically
attired
and
riding
handsome
besides
these
attendants
are
several
eunuchs
on
horseback
accompanied
by
a
multitude
of

lackeys
on
foot
with
large
canes
who
advance
a
great
way
before
the
princess

to
the
right
and
left
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
the
road
and
driving
before
them
every
intruder
immediately
behind
retinue
appears
a
principal
lady
of
the
court
mounted
and
attended
in
much
the

manner
as
the

this
lady
is
followed
by
a
third
she
by
a
fourth
and
so
on
until
fifteen

sixteen
females
of
quality
pass
with
a
grandeur
of
appearance

and
retinue
more
or
less
proportionate
to
their
rank
pay
and
office
there
is
something
very
impressive
of
state
and
royalty
in
the
march
of
these
sixty
or
more
elephants
in
their
solemn
and
as
it
were
measured
steps
in
the
splendour
of
the

the
brilliant
and

if
i

not
regarded
this
display
of
magnificence
with
a
sort
of
philosophical
indifference
i
should
have
been
apt
to
be
carried
away
by
such
flights
of
imagination
as
inspire
most
of
the
indian
poets
when
they
represent
the
elephants
as
conveying
so
many
goddesses
concealed
from
the
vulgar
gaze
dramatic
justice

the
scheming
princess

in
aurangzîb

dangerously
ill
and
while
he
was
unconscious
rushanara
believing
him
to
be
dying
abstracted
the
signet
ring
from
his
finger
and
issued
letters
as
under
the
royal
seal
to
the
various
viceroys
and
governors
setting
aside
the
succession
of
the
emperor

rajput
princess
in

of
another

a
boy
of

disappeared

said
by

aurangzîb
ruled
with
a
firm
hand
and
in
strict
justice
according
to
the
law
of
islam
but
though
a
man
of
great
intellectual
powers
of
marvellous
energy
and
indomitable
courage
he
was
wanting
in
imagination
sympathy
and
foresight
the
highest
qualities
of
a
really
great
ruler
he
checked
the
dissolute
conduct
of
the
nobles
and
set
an
example
of
industry
and
devotion
to
duty
but
his
narrow
bigoted
disposition
inclined
him
to
distrust
even
his
own
ministers
so
that
unlike
his
three
predecessors
he
was
badly
served
by
the
lieutenants
in
whose
hands
the
administration
of
the
provinces
rested
he
surrounded
himself
with
religious
bigots
of
the
sunni
sect
of
muhammadans
who
aided
him
in
bitter
persecution
of
the
hindus
hardly
anything
of
artistic
or
architectural
interest
was
created
under
his
patronage
most
of
the
great
artists
who
attended
shah
jahan
court
were
dismissed
as
unorthodox
or
heretics
and
many
noble
monuments
were
mutilated
by

the
ground
that
they
contravened

from
that

was
uneventful
agra
in

agra
did
not
take
any
prominent
part
in
the

of
the

a
mob
plundered
the

burnt
the
public
offices
and
killed
a
number
of

but
the
rioters
left
soon
to
join
their
comrades
at

there
was
a
small
engagement
outside

the
whole

the

imposing

it

that
most
exquisite
of
mosques
the
mûti

and
the
palaces
of
akbar
and

jahan
the
principal
or
north
entrance
is
the
delhi
gate
nearly
opposite
to
the
railway
station
and
the
jâmi
masjid
formerly
there
was
a
walled
enclosure
in
front
of
this
gate
called
the
tripulia
or
three
gates
which
was
used
as
a
market
this
was
cleared
away
by
the
military
authorities
in
crossing
the
drawbridge
over
the
moat
which
surrounds
the
fort
the
visitor
passes
the
outer
gate
and
by
a
paved
incline
reaches
the
hathi
pol
or
elephant
gate
plate
iii
so
called
from
the
two
stone
elephants
with
riders
which
formerly
stood
outside
the
gate
on
the
highest
of
the
platforms
on
either
side
of
it
the
statues
and
elephants
were
thrown
down
by
order
of
aurangzîb
there
are
four
hollow
places
in
each
platform
where
the
legs
of
the
elephants
were
morticed
into
it
the
gate
is
a
fine
example
of
the
early
mogul
style
it
contains
the
or
music
gallery
where
the
royal
kettledrums
announced
the
emperor
arrival
or
departure
and
all
state
functions
it
was
also
a
and
probably
the
quarters
of
a
high
military
officer
but
it
is
certainly
not
as
the
guides
have
it
the
darshan
darwaza
or
gate
of
sights
described
by
william
finch
where
the
emperor
jahangir
showed
himself
at
sunrise
to
his
nobles
and
to
the
multitude
assembled
in
the
plain
below
the
darshan
darwaza
was
undoubtedly
near
the
old
disused
which
was
joined
to
the
royal
apartments
of
the
palace
by
a
private
passage
and
answers
to
finch
description
of
leading
into
a
fair
court
extending
along
the
river
the
elephant
gate
is
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
palace
and
was
never
connected
with
it
except
by
the
public
road
it
is
worth
while
to
climb
the
top
of
the
gate
by
the
staircase
on
the
right
inside
the
fort
there
is
a
fine
view
of
the
fort
and
beyond
the
walls
the
white
domes
of
the
taj
appear
in
the
distance
the
is
visible
on
the
left
towards
the
town
you
look
down
into
the
quadrangle
of
the
jâmi
masjid
the
pavilions
on
the
summit
of
the
great
octagonal
towers
flanking
the
gate
are
finely
carved
and
bear
traces
of
painting
and
enamelled
descending
the
staircase
to
the
floors
beneath
one
can
wander
through
the
curious
small
chambers
and
look
out
from
the
balconies
on
the
front
of
the
gate
the
mûti
masjid
the
road
to
the
left
after
passing
the
elephant
gate
leads
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
mûti
masjid
or
pearl
mosque
placed
on
the
highest
point
of
the
fort
enclosure
you
pass
on
the
left
a
building
known
as
dansa
jât
house
said
to
have
been
occupied
by
the
rajahs
of
bharatpur
when
the
jâts
held
the
fort
it
has
been
made
hideous
by
modern
additions
which
have
converted
it
into
officers
quarters
the
entrance
to
the
mûti
masjid
is
very
plain
and
unpretending
so
that
one
is
hardly
prepared
for
the
beauty
purity
and
the
unaffected
expression
of
an
exalted
religious
feeling
which
characterize
the
interior
it
is
rare
to
find
an
indian
building
in
which
the
effect
is
produced
with
hardly
any
ornament
but
solely
by
the
perfection
of
proportions
beauty
of
material
and
harmony
of
constructive
design
the
courtyard
in
front
of
the
mosque
with
its
arcades
and
gateways
is
a
noble
setting
to
the
pearl
as
the
mosque
is
appropriately
called
there
is
a
subtle
rhythm
in
the
placing
of
the
three
domes
over
the
seven
arches
of
the
mosque
which
saves
the
whole
design
from
monotony
while
the
marvellous
grace
of
the
contours
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
finest
of
shah
jahan
buildings
makes
each
dome
grow
up
from
the
roof
like
a
on
the
point
of
unfolding
the
octagonal
pavilions
at
the
four
corners
of
the
mosque
and
the
dainty
little
kiosques
placed
as
decoration
over
the
arches
and
over
the
gateways
of
the
courtyard
echo
the
harmonies
of
the
larger
constructive
details
and
give
completeness
to
the
composition
the
interior
of
the
mosque
owes
its
dignity
to
the
same
greatness
of
style
and
perfection
of
the
proportions
the
three
aisles
are
formed
by
massive
piers
of
single
blocks
of
marble
with
all
its
simplicity
there
is
consummate
art
both
in
the
placing
of
the
ornament
and
in
the
beautiful
springing
of
the
arches
from
the
supporting
piers
the
fine
workmanship
is
worthy
of
the
art
on
either
side
of
the
mosque
there
is
a
small
chamber
for
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
with
a
window
filled
with
a
carved
marble
looking
on
to
the
interior
they
could
thus
attend
to
the
services
of
the
mosque
without
being
seen
the
staircases
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
courtyard
give
private
access
to
the
apartments
of
the
palace
the
persian
inscription
inlaid
in
black
marble
under
the
wide
projecting
cornice
of
the
mosque
is
a
poetic
tribute
to
the
beauty
of
the
building
and
a
panegyric
of
its
founder
from
it
we
learn
that
it
was
built
by
shah
jahan
it
took
seven
years
to
build
and
cost
three
lakhs
of
rupees
the
dimensions
of
the

given
by

are

internally
the
dersane
darwaza
nearly
opposite
to
the
mûti
masjid
you
pass
on
the
left
an
inclined
passage
which
leads
to
an
old
gateway
a
part
of
buildings
very
little
remains
of
the
original
buildings
which
connected
it
with
the
palace
in
the
time
of
jahangir
but
there
can
not
be
much
doubt
that
this
was
the
locality
described
by
william
finch
as
the
dersane
darwaza
leading
into
a
fair
court
extending
along
the
river
in
which
the
king
looks
forth
every
morning
at
which
he
salutes
and
then
his
nobles
resort
to
their
obeisance
right
under
the
place
where
he
looks
out
is
a
kind
of
scaffold
whereon
his
nobles
stand
but
the
with
others
await
below
in

court
here
also
every
noone
he
looketh
forth
to
behold

fighting
of
elephants
lyons
buffles
killing
of
deare
with
leopards
which
is
a
custom
on
every
day
of
the
weeke
sunday
excepted
on
which
is
no
fighting
but
tuesday
on
the
contrary
is
a
day
of
blood
both
of
fighting
beasts
and
justiced
men
the
king
judging
and
seeing
executions
the
the
road
now
turns
towards
the
right
through
the
mîna
bazar
the
old
where
merchants
displayed
jewellery
brocades
and
similar
stuffs
for
the
nobles
and
others
attending
the
court
a
gateway
leads
into
the
great
courtyard
of
the
or
hall
of
public
audience
which
with
its
surrounding
arcades
was
for
a
long
time
used
as
an
armoury
for
the
british
garrison
the
hall
itself
was
restored
in
by
sir
john
strachey
then
of
the
provinces
the
courtyard
has
recently
been
put
back
as
far
as
possible
into
its
original
condition
by
lord
orders
a
further
great
improvement
has
been
made
by
the
removal
of
the
hideous
modern
additions
which
entirely
concealed
all
the
arcades
the
present
hall
which
is
an
open
pavilion
formed
by
a
triple
row
of
colonnades
was
commenced
by
shah
jahan
but
if
we
may
believe
tradition
was
not
completed
until
the
year
of
the
reign
of
aurangzîb
the
arcades
surrounding
the
quadrangle
are
probably
of
akbar
time
the
interior
dimensions
of
the
hall
are
feet
by
feet
it
is
constructed
of
red
sandstone
plastered
over
with
a
fine
white
polished
stucco
which
served
both
as
a
protection
to
the
stone
and
as
a
ground
for
coloured
decoration
and
gilding
this
was
carried
to
the
perfection
of
a
fine
art
by
the
old
mogul
builders
but
the
restoration
of
it
in
was
very
indifferently
carried
out
the
throne
of
the
emperor
was
in
an
alcove
of
inlaid
marble
at
the
back
of
the
hall
and
connected
with
the
royal
apartments
behind
here
he
sat
daily
to
give
audience
to
his
court
to
receive
ambassadors
and
to
administer
justice
at
the
foot
of
the
alcove
is
a
square
slab
of
marble
about
feet
in
height
on
which
it
is
said
his
ministers
stood
to
receive
petitions
to
the
emperor
and
to
convey
his
commands
thereon
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
throne
are
chambers
with
perforated
marble
windows
through
which
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
could
view
the
proceedings
bernier
lively
description
though
it
properly
belongs
to
the
at
delhi
will
enable
us
to
picture
the
scene
in
the
days
of
the
great
mogul
the
monarch
every
day
about
noon
sits
upon
his
throne
with
some
of
his
sons
at
his
right
and
left
while
eunuchs
standing
about
the
royal
person
flap
away
the
flies
with
peacocks
tails
agitate
the
air
with
large
fans
or
wait
with
undivided
attention
and
profound
humility
to
perform
the
different
services
allotted
to
each
immediately
under
the
throne
is
an
enclosure
surrounded
by
silver
rails
in
which
are
assembled
the
whole
body
of
nobles
the
rajas
and
the
ambassadors
all
standing
their
eyes
bent
downwards
and
their
hands
crossed
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
throne
are
the
or
inferior
also
standing
in
the
same
posture
of
profound
reverence
the
remainder
of
the
spacious
room
and
indeed
the
whole
courtyard
is
filled
with
persons
of
all
ranks
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
because
it
is
in
this
extensive
hall
that
the
king
gives
audience
indiscriminately
to
all
his
subjects
hence
it
is
called
or
audience
chamber
of
high
and
low
during
the
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
that
this
ceremony
continues
a
certain
number
of
the
royal
horses
pass
before
the
throne
that
the
king
may
see
whether
they
are
well
used
and
usbec
of
every
kind
and
each
dog
with
a
small
red
covering
lastly
every
species
of
the
birds
of
prey
used
in
field
sports
for
catching
partridges
cranes
hares
and
even
it
is
said
for
hunting
antelopes
on
which
they
pounce
with
violence
beating
their
heads
and
blinding
them
with
their
wings
and
claws
after
this
parade
the
more
serious
business
of
the
day
was
attended
to
the
emperor
reviewed
his
cavalry
with
peculiar
attention
for
he
was
personally
acquainted
with
every
trooper
then
all
the
petitions
held
up
in
the
assembled
crowd
were
read
and
disposed
of
before
the
audience
closed
on
festivals
or
other
special
occasions
the
pillars
of
the
hall
were
hung
with
gold
brocades
and
flowered
satin
canopies
fastened
with
red
silken
cords
were
raised
over
the
whole
apartment
the
floor
was
covered
entirely
with
the
most
magnificent
silk
carpets
a
gorgeous
tent
larger
than
the
hall
to
which
it
was
fastened
and
supported
by
poles
overlaid
with
silver
was
pitched
outside
every
compartment
of
the
arcades
round
the
courtyard
was
decorated
by
one
of
the
great
nobles
at
his
own
expense
with
gold
brocades
and
costly
carpets
each
one
vying
with
the
other
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
emperor
to
whom
on
such
occasions
an
offering
of
gold
or
jewels
more
or
less
valuable
according
to
the
pay
and
rank
of
the
giver
must
be
presented
jahangir
just
in
front
of
the
is
a
great
stone
cistern
cut
out
of
a
single
block
with
steps
inside
and
out
known
as
jahangir
a
bowl
or
there
is
a
long
persian
inscription
round
the
outer
rim
the
only
part
now
decipherable
shows
that
it
was
made
for
jahangir
in
it
is
nearly
feet
in
height
and
feet
in
diameter
at
the
top
its
original
place
is
said
to
have
been
one
of
the
courts
of
the
jahangiri
mahal
the
tomb
of
mr
close
by
jahangiri
is
the
grave
of
john
russell
colvin
the
of
the
provinces
who
died
in
the
fort
during
the
disturbances
of
the
inner
mîna
bazar
before
entering
the
private
apartments
of
the
palace
which
are
at
the
back
of
the
we
may
pass
through
the
gateway
on
the
left
of
the
courtyard
and
enter
a
smaller
one
which
was
the
private
bazar
where
merchants
sold
jewellery
silks
and
costly
brocades
to
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
who
were
seated
in
the
marble
balcony
which
overlooks
it
plate
a
narrow
staircase
gave
access
to
the
balcony
from
the
courtyard
we
may
well
believe
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
ladies
time
was
spent
in
this
quarter
of
the
palace
sometimes
the
great
mogul
and
his
court
would
amuse
themselves
by
holding
a
mock
fair
in
which
the
prettiest
of
the
nobles
wives
and
daughters
would
act
as
traders
and
the
emperors
and
the
begums
would
bargain
with
them
in
the
most
approved
bazar
fashion
the
emperor
would
haggle
for
the
value
of
an
anna
and
the
ladies
would
feign
indignation
scold
his
majesty
roundly
and
tell
him
to
go
where
he
could
suit
himself
better
the
begums
betray
if
possible
a
still
greater
anxiety
to
be
served
cheaply
high
words
are
heard
on
every
side
and
the
loud
and
scurrilous
quarrels
of
the
buyers
and
sellers
create
a
complete
farce
but
when
at
last
the
bargains
are
struck

history
of

a
hindu
temple
built
by

of

the

has
suffered
so
much
from
ruthless
vandalism
that
it
is
difficult
to
realize
its
former
magnificence
it
was
formerly
laid
out
in
marble
with
fountains
and
these
were
carried
off
by
the

for

of

it
is
something
like
the

but
far
inferior
in
design
the
further
corner
of

opens
into
a
small
chamber
overlooking
the
courtyard
of

is
pointed
out
by
the

as
the

where
shah
jahan
was
confined
this
may
be
accepted
or
not
according
to
the
choice
of
the
visitor
when
distinct
historical
authority
is
wanting
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
real
tradition
and
pure
fable
in
the
tales
of
these
garrulous
folk
the
historical
evidence
seems
to
show
that
shah
jahan
was
not
kept
a
close
prisoner
but
simply
confined
to
certain
apartments
in
the
palace
we
will
now
pass
over
to
the
river
side
of
the
machhi

part
of

which

all
built
by
shah
jahan
and
occupied
by
him
in
the
days
of
his
royal
state
and
sovereignty
they
rank
with
the
at

as
the
most
exquisite
of

in
though
much
smaller
than
the
at
delhi
it
is
certainly
not
inferior
in
the
beauty
of
its
proportions
and
decoration
most
of
the
decorative
work
of
these
marble
pavilions
is
directly
derived
from
persian
art
and
inspired
by
the
persian
love
of
flowers
which
almost
amounted
to
all
the
details
are
charming
but
the
dados
especially
edged
with
inlaid
work
and
carved
with
floral
types
in
the
most
delicate
relief
show
to
perfection
that
wonderful
decorative
instinct
which
seems
to
be
born
in
the
oriental
handicraftsman
the
designer
has
naïvely
translated
into
marble
the
conventional
indian
just
as
they
were
in
every
palace
garden
but
there
is
perfect
art
in
the
seeming
absence
of
all
artifice
the
dados
outside
the
taj
are
similar
in
design
to
these
though
larger
and
correspondingly
bolder

on

side
from
the
persian
inscription
which
runs
round
the
four
sides
of

black
throne
we
learn
that
it
was
made

for
jahangir
this
was
two
years
before
the
death
of
his
father
akbar
and
he
was
then
only
prince
salîm
the
throne
was
therefore
probably
made
to
commemorate
the
recognition
by
akbar
of
his
son

to
the
succession
on
this
terrace
jahangir
sat
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
his
brigantines

to
watch
the
elephant
fights

place
beneath
the
walls
from
side

side
of
his
throne
there
is
a
long
fissure
which
opened
so
says
tradition
when
the
jât
rajah
jawahar
singh
of
bharatpur
in
set
his
usurping
feet
on
the
throne
of
the
great
mogul
the
tradition
holds
that
blood
spurted
out
of
the
throne
in
two
places
and
red
marks
in
the
stone
are
pointed
out
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
story
the
impious
chief
was
shortly
afterwards
assassinated
in

of

disfigured

we
will
pause
at
a
corner
of

where
a
small
apartment
contains
an
interesting
relic
of
the
afghan
expedition
of
the
somnath
gates
taken
from
the
tomb
of
mahmud
of
ghazni
in
the
capture
of
that
city
by
the
british
they
were
the
subject
of
a
most
extraordinary
archæological
blunder
by
the
lord
ellenborough
who
in
a
grandiloquent
proclamation
identifying
them
with
the
gates
of
carved
sandalwood
which
mahmud
according
to
tradition
had
taken
from
the
celebrated
hindu
temple
of
somnath
in
announced
to
the
people
of
india
that
the
insult
of
eight
hundred
years
had
been
avenged
the
gates
were
conveyed
on
a
triumphal
car
through
the
towns
of
northern
india
to
the
agra
fort
and
deposited
there
with
great
ceremony
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
wood
is
deodar
and
not
sandalwood
and
from
the
style
of
the
ornament
there
can
be
hardly
a
doubt
that
the
gates
were
made
at
or
near
ghazni
one
glance
would
convince
any
expert
in
oriental
archæology
that
they
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
been
the
gates
of
a
hindu
temple
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
original
gates
were
destroyed
by
fire
and
that
these
were
made
to
replace
them
but
there
seems
to
be
considerable
doubt
whether
mahmud
really
took
away
any
gates
from
the
somnath
temple
it
certainly
would
have
been
unusual
for
the
great
muhammadan
plunderer
to
have
burdened
himself
with
an
archæological
relic
which
in
those
days
was
not
easily
convertible
into
cash
a
which
is
nailed
to
the
gate
is
not
as
is
generally
supposed
a
propitiation
of
the
goddess
of
fortune
but
a
token
from
the
owner
of
some
sick
animal
that
he
would
bring
an
offering
to
the
shrine
in
the
event
of
a
cure
resulting
from
his
visit
this
was
an
old
custom
among
the
tartars
and
other
nomad
tribes
who
valued
horses
and
cattle
as
their
most
precious
possessions
the
jahangiri
mahal
the
palace
called
after
jahangir
the
jahangiri
mahal
is
in
many
respects
the
most
remarkable
building
of
its
class
in
india
nothing
could
be
more
striking
than
the
contrast
between
the
extreme
elegance
bordering
on
effeminacy
of
the
marble
pavilions
of
shah
palaces
and
the
robust
virile
yet
highly
imaginative
architecture
of
this
palace
of
akbar
for
though
it
bears
jahangir
name
there
can
not
be
much
doubt
that
it
was
planned
and
partially
if
not
completely
carried
out
by
akbar
with
the
same
architects
who
built
fatehpur
sikri
it
is
the
perfected
type
of
the
style
which
we
see
in
process
of
evolution
at
fatehpur
and
were
it
not
for
the
taj
we
might
regret
the
new
element
which
came
into
mogul
architecture
with
tomb
both
of
these
styles
which
appear
side
by
side
in
the
agra
fort
are
intensely
typical
of
the
men
and
the
times
which
produced
them
the
one
is
stamped
throughout
with
the
personality
of
akbar
the
and
distinguished
by
the
stately
solidity
of
jain
and
hindu
architecture
in
the
other
the
native
vigour
of
the
earlier
indian
styles
has
been
softened
by
the
cultured
eclecticism
of
persia
and
arabia
for
the
manly
dignity
of
akbar
court
had
given
place
to
the
sensual
luxury
of
shah
jahan
on
the
river
side
of
the
palace
there
is
an
octagonal
pavilion
placed
similarly
to
the
samman
burj
which
is
very
charming
in
its
fresco
decoration
though
the
colour
has
faded
very
much
it
is
possibly
this
pavilion
to
which
badâyunî
one
of
akbar
biographers
refers
when
he
describes
a
brahmin
named
dêbi
being
pulled
up
the
walls
of
the
castle
sitting
on
a
a
native
bed
till
he
arrived
near
the
balcony
where
the
emperor
used
to
sleep
whilst
thus
suspended
he
instructed
his
majesty
in
the
secrets
and
legends
of
hinduism
in
the
manner
of
worshipping
idols
the
fire
the
sun
and
stars
and
of
revering
the
chief
gods
of
these
unbelievers
the
priests
of
other
religions
were
similarly
carried
up
to
converse
with
akbar
adjoining
this
is
a
set
of
small
rooms
known
as
akbar
apartments
which
even
in
their
present
dilapidated
state
show
that
they
must
have
possessed
a
richness
and
beauty
of
decoration
inferior
to
nothing
else
in
the
whole
fort
the
dados
were
decorated
with
work
on
a
gold
ground
the
borders
are
still
almost
intact
but
the
rest
of
the
relief
ornament
seems
to
have
been
wantonly
hacked
off
out
of
pure
mischief
i
believe
this
is
the
only
example
of
work
in
any
of
akbar
buildings
the
treatment
of
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
with
the
characteristic
cuspings
of
arabian
and
moorish
architects
is
admirable
passing
through
these
we
enter
a
long
room
known
as
the
library
in
which
a
not
very
successful
attempt
was
made
some
years
ago
to
restore
the
painted
decoration
it
is
to
be
devoutly
hoped
that
this
and
other
dangerous
experiments
of
the
kind
will
not
be
continued
except
under
skilled
artistic
supervision
the
restoration
of
the
structural
parts
of
the
palace
and
of
the
stone
carving
is
a
more
easy
matter
for
the
descendants
of
the
very
men
who
built
and
carved
the
palace
still
practise
their
art
in
agra
and
round
about
this
has
been
admirably
carried
out
by
the
public
works
department
under
lord
curzon
orders
the
outer
courtyard
on
the
riverside
is
very
interesting
especially
for
a
very
elegant
and
original
porch
in
which
saracenic
feeling
predominates
but
on
entering
the
inner
courtyard
plate
vi
it
is
more
easy
to
realize
that
this
palace
is
one
of
the
great
masterpieces
of
mogul
architecture
the
beauty
of
this
inner
quadrangle
is
derived
not
so
much
from
its
fine
proportions
and
rich
ornamentation
as
from
the
wonderful
rhythmic
play
of
light
and
shadow
produced
by
the
bracket
form
of
construction
and
the
admirable
disposition
of
the
openings
for
doors
windows
and
colonnades
the
north
side
of
the
quadrangle
is
formed
by
a
pillared
hall
of
distinctly
hindu
design
full
of
the
feeling
of
mystery
characteristic
of
indigenous
indian
styles
the
subdued
light
of
the
interior
adds
to
the
impressiveness
of
its
great
piers
stretching
their
giant
brackets
up
to
the
roof
like
the
gnarled
and
twisted
branches
of
primeval
forest
trees
a
very
interesting
point
of
view
can
be
obtained
from
the
gallery
which
runs
round
the
upper
part
of
the
hall
one
of
jahangir
wives
a
hindu
princess
of
jodhpur
hence
known
as
jodh
bai
lived
in
this
part
of
the
palace
and
the
room
on
the
west
side
of
the
quadrangle
surrounded
by
a
number
of
oblong
niches
is
said
to
have
been
her
temple
in
which
the
images
of
hanuman
and
other
hindu
deities
were
kept
on
the
roof
of
the
jahangiri
mahal
there
are
two
fine
pavilions
also
a
number
of
cisterns
which
supplied
the
palace
with
water
in
the
side
of
one
of
them
there
are
a
number
of
lined
with
copper
over
each
of
which
is
a
circular
stone
label
inscribed
with
the
part
of
the
palace
to
which
it
gave
a
supply
the
salîmgarh
on
the
rising
ground
behind
the
courtyard
of
the
there
formerly
existed
a
palace
called
the
salîmgarh
before
accession
he
was
known
as
prince
salîm
and
tradition
associates
this
palace
with
him
fergusson
however
states
that
in
his
time
an
exquisite
fragment
of
a
palace
built
by
shere
shah
or
his
son
salîm
existed
here
the
salîmgarh
at
delhi
is
named
after
the
son
of
shere
shah
salîm
shah
sur
who
built
it
and
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
two
salîms
gave
his
name
to
the
salîmgarh
at
agra
fort
is
known
to
have
been
built
to
replace
an
older
one
known
as
the
badalgarh
by
salîm
shah
sur
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
part
of
the
palace
may
have
been
left
and
retained
the
name
of
its
founder
the
only
part
of
the
salîmgarh
which
now
remains
is
a
large
pavilion
in
front
of
the
barracks
the
upper
half
of
the
exterior
is
carved
with
extraordinary
richness
the
style
of
design
certainly
indicates
the
period
of
the
jahangiri
mahal
and
akbar
buildings
at
fatehpur
sikri
rather
than
shere
shah
work
the
jâmi
masjid
nearly
opposite
to
the
delhi
gate
of
the
fort
is
the
jâmi
masjid
or
cathedral
mosque
built
by
jahanara
shah
jahan
eldest
daughter
it
is
in
the
same
style
as
the
splendid
mosque
built
by
shah
jahan
at
delhi
but
far
inferior
in
merit
there
is
a
tameness
about
the
whole
design
very
unusual
in
the
buildings
of
this
epoch
the
striping
of
the
domes
is
decidedly
unpleasant
an
inscription
over
the
main
archway
states
that
it
was
completed
in
the
year
a
cost
of
five
lakhs
of
rupees
the

arjumand
banu
begam
the
favourite
wife
of
shah
jahan
is
better
known
by
her
other
name
mumtaz
mahal
the
crown
of
the
palace
her
father
was
asaf
khan
who
was
brother
of
the
empress
nur
mahal
jahangir
wife
she
was
thus
the
granddaughter
of
jahangir
prime
minister
whose
tomb
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
will
be
described
hereafter
in
at
the
age
of
nineteen
years
she
was
married
to
shah
jahan
then
prince
khurram
who
though
hardly
had
already
another
wife
this
second
marriage
however
was
a
real
and
mumtaz
was
her
husband
inseparable
companion
on
all
his
journeys
and
military
expeditions
shah
jahan
like
his
father
allowed
his
wife
a
large
share
in
the
responsibilities
of
government
like
nur
mahal
she
was
famed
as
much
for
her
charity
as
for
her
beauty
her
influence
was
especially
exercised
in
obtaining
clemency
for
criminals
condemned
to
death
she
bore
him
fourteen
children
and
died
in
childbed
in
or
the
second
year
after
shah
jahan
accession
to
the
throne
at
burhanpur
whither
she
had
accompanied
her
husband
on
a
campaign
against
khan
jahan
lodi
the
emperor
was
overpowered
with
grief
for
a
week
he
refused
to
see
any
of
his
ministers
or
to
transact
any
business
of
state
he
even
contemplated
resigning
the
throne
and
dividing
the
empire
among
his
sons
for
two
years
the
court
observed
strict
mourning
no
music
or
festivities
were
allowed
the
wearing
of
jewels
the
use
of
perfumes
and
luxuries
of
all
kinds
were
forbidden
the
month
of
zikad
in
which
she
died
was
observed
as
a
month
of
mourning
for
many
years
afterwards
the
body
of
mumtaz
was
removed
to
agra
and
remained
temporarily
in
the
garden
of
the
taj
while
the
foundations
of
the
building
were
being
laid
it
was
then
placed
in
the
vault
where
it
now
lies
a
temporary
dome
covered
the
tomb
while
the
great
monument
grew
up
over
it
the
building
of
the
taj
it
was
one
of
those
intervals
in
history
when
the
whole
genius
of
a
people
is
concentrated
on
great
architectural
works
and
art
becomes
an
epitome
of
the
age
for
the
taj
was
not
a
creation
of
a
single
but
the
consummation
of
a
great
art
epoch
since
the
time
of
akbar
the
best
architects
artists
and
art
workmen
of
india
persia
arabia
and
central
asia
had
been
attracted
to
the
mogul
court
all
the
resources
of
a
great
empire
were
at
their
disposal
for
shah
jahan
desired
that
this
monument
of
his
grief
should
be
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
sad
circumstances
which
attended
the
early
death
of
the
devoted
wife
who
had
endeared
herself
to
the
people
might
well
inspire
all
his
subjects
to
join
in
the
pious
intentions
according
to
the
old
tartar
custom
a
garden
was
chosen
as
a
site
for
the
tomb
a
garden
planted
with
flowers
and
flowering
shrubs
the
emblems
of
life
and
solemn
cypress
the
emblem
of
death
and
eternity
such
a
garden
in
the
mogul
days
was
kept
up
as
a
during
the
owner
lifetime
and
used
as
his
last
after
his
death
the
old
tradition
laid
down
that
it
must
be
acquired
by
fair
means
and
not
by
force
or
fraud
so
rajah
jey
singh
to
whom
the
garden
belonged
was
compensated
by
the
gift
of
another
property
from
the
emperor
private
estate
shah
jahan
next
appointed
a
council
of
the
best
architects
of
his
empire
for
preparing
the
design
for
the
building
drawings
of
many
of
the
most
celebrated
buildings
of
the
world
were
shown
and
discussed
it
is
even
believed
that
one
geronimo
verroneo
an
italian
who
was
then
in
the
mogul
service
submitted
designs
for
shah
jahan
inspection
a
fact
which
has
led
many
writers
into
the
error
of
supposing
that
the
taj
as
completed
was
actually
designed
by
him
the
design
eventually
accepted
was
by
ustad
isa
who
is
stated
in
one
account
to
have
been
a
byzantine
turk
and
in
another
a
native
of
shiraz
in
persia
the
came
from
many
different
parts
the
chief

from
baghdad

and
multan

builders
from
asiatic

and
from
samarkand
the

from

and
from
baghdad
the
principal
calligraphist
for
the
inscriptions
from

and
sapphires
arabia
coral
and

diamonds
persia
onyx
and
amethyst
twenty
thousand
men
were
employed
in
the
construction
which
took
seventeen
years
to
complete
the
sarcophagus
was
originally
enclosed
by
a
fence
or
screen
of
gold
studded
with
gems
this
was
removed
in
and
replaced
by
the
present
exquisite
screen
of
pierced
marble
plate
the
taj
also
possessed
formerly
two
wonderful
silver
doors
austin
de
bordeaux
a
french
goldsmith
who
was
employed
by
shah
jahan
in
making
the
celebrated
peacock
throne
may
possibly
have
executed
some
of
this
in
the
taj
but
there
is
no
evidence
worthy
of
consideration
to
support
the
common
belief
that
he
designed
or
superintended
the
or
inlaid
marble
decoration
of
the
building
which
is
entirely
of
the
persian
school
these
silver
doors
were
looted
and
melted
down
by
the
jâts
in
besides
the
lavish
expenditure
on
the
building
lakhs
of
rupees
were
spent
in
providing
the
richest
of
persian
silk
carpets
golden
lamps
and
magnificent
candlesticks
a
sheet
of
pearls
valued
at
several
lakhs
was
made
to
cover
the
sarcophagus
this
was
carried
off
by
the
amir
husein
ali
khan
in
as
part
of
his
share
of
the
spoil
of
agra
the
total
expenditure
according
to
native
accounts
amounted
to
nearly
lakhs
of
rupees
it
is
said
that
shah
jahan
had
intended
to
construct
a
mausoleum
for
himself
opposite
to
the
taj
on
the
other
side
of
the
jumna
and
to
connect
the
two
by
a
great
bridge
the
project
was
interrupted
and
never
completed
owing
to
the
usurpation
of
aurangzîb
shortly
after
the
foundations
were
laid
the
intention
of
the
taj
the
taj
has
been
the
subject
of
numberless
critical
essays
but
many
of
them
have
missed
the
mark
entirely
because
the
writers
have
not
been
sufficiently
conversant
with
the
spirit
of
eastern
artistic
thought
all
comparisons
with
the
parthenon
or
other
classic
buildings
are
useless
one
can
not
compare
homer
with
the
mâhabhâratâ
or
kalîdâs
with
euripides
the
parthenon
was
a
temple
for
pallas
athene
an
exquisite
casket
to
contain
the
jewel
the
taj
is
the
jewel
the
ideal
itself
indian
architecture
is
in
much
closer
affinity
to
the
great
conceptions
of
the
gothic
builders
than
it
is
to
anything
of
classic
or
renaissance
construction
the
gothic
cathedral
with
its
sculptured
arches
and
its
spires
pointing
heavenwards
is
a
symbol
as
most
eastern
buildings
are
symbols
the
mogul
artists
being
prevented
by
the
precepts
of
the
muhammadan
religion
from
attempting
sculpture
as
understood
in
europe
succeeded
in
investing
their
great
architectural
monuments
with
an
extraordinary
personal
character
there
is
a
wonderful
personality
in
the
dignity
and
greatness
of
akbar
tomb
we
see
the
scholar
and
the
polished
courtier
in
but
the
taj
carries
this
idea
of
personality
further
than
had
been
attempted
in
any
of
the
mogul
monuments
it
represents
in
art
the
highest
development
towards
individualism
the
struggle
against
the
restraints
of
ritualism
and
dogma
which
akbar
initiated
in
religion
every
one
who
has
seen
the
taj
must
have
felt
that
there
is
something
in
it
difficult
to
define
or
analyze
which
differentiates
it
from
all
other
buildings
in
the
world
sir
edwin
arnold
has
struck
the
true
note
of
criticism
in
the
following
lines
not
architecture
as
all
others
are
but
the
proud
passion
of
an
emperor
love
wrought
into
living
stone
which
gleams
and
soars
with
body
of
beauty
shrining
soul
and
thought
as
when
some
face
divinely
fair
unveils
before
our
eyes
some
woman
beautiful
unspeakably
and
the
blood
quickens
and
the
spirit
leaps
and
will
to
worship
bends
the
knees
while
breath
forgets
to
breathe
so
is
the
taj
this
is
not
a
mere
flight
of
poetic
fancy
but
a
deep
and
true
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
taj
what
were
the
thoughts
of
the
designers
and
of
shah
jahan
himself
when
they
resolved
to
raise
a
monument
of
eternal
love
to
the
crown
of
the
palace
taj
mahal
surely
not
only
of
a
mausoleum
a
sepulchre
fashioned
after
ordinary
architectural
canons
but
of
an
architectonic
ideal
symbolical
of
her
womanly
grace
and
beauty
those
critics
who
have
objected
to
the
effeminacy
of
the
architecture
unconsciously
pay
the
highest
tribute
to
the
genius
of
the
builders
the
taj
was
meant
to
be
feminine
the
whole
conception
and
every
line
and
detail
of
it
express
the
intention
of
the
designers
it
is
mumtaz
mahal
herself
radiant
in
her
youthful
beauty
who
still
lingers
on
the
banks
of
the
shining
jumna
at
early
morn
in
the
glowing
midday
sun
or
in
the
silver
moonlight
or
rather
we
should
say
it
conveys
a
more
abstract
thought
it
is
india
noble
tribute
to
the
grace
of
indian
womanhood
the
venus
de
milo
of
the
east
bearing
this
in
mind
we
can
understand
how
foolish
it
is
to
formulate
criticisms
of
the
taj
based
on
ordinary
architectural
principles
as
practised
in
europe
many
of
these
criticisms
which
might
be
appropriate
enough
if
applied
to
a
modern
provincial
town
hall
are
only
silly
and
impertinent
in
reference
to
the
taj
some
are
born
others
and
there
are
many
who
can
find
beauty
in
one
particular
form
or
expression
of
art
and
in
no
others
so
the
taj
will
always
find
detractors
but
whoever
tries
to
understand
the
imaginative
side
of
eastern
thought
will
leave
the
critics
to
themselves
and
take
unrestrained
delight
in
the
exquisitely
subtle
rhythm
of
this
marvellous
creation
of
mogul
art
the
gateway
of
the
taj
faces
a
spacious
quadrangle
surrounded
by
arcades
this
is
a
or
place
where
travellers
halted
here
also
the
poor
were
provided
with
food
and
shelter
and
on
the
anniversary
day
vast
sums
were
distributed
in
charity
from
the
funds
with
which
the
taj
was
endowed
it
is
well
to
pause
before
entering
and
admire
the
proportions
and
perfect
taste
of
the
decoration
of
this
gateway
for
afterwards
one
has
no
eyes
for
anything
but
the
taj
itself
it
is
much
finer
in
design
than
the
similar
gateway
of
akbar
tomb
at
sikandra
an
arabic
inscription
in
black
marble
of
passages
taken
from
the
koran
frames
the
principal
arch
and
invites
the
pure
of
heart
to
enter
the
gardens
of
paradise
the
first
view
of
the
taj
is
from
within
this
noble
portal
framed
by
the
sombre
shadow
of
the
great
arch
which
opens
on
to
the
garden
at
the
end
of
a
long
terrace
its
gracious
outline
partly
mirrored
in
the
still
water
of
a
wide
canal
a
fairy
vision
of
like
the
spirit
of
purity
seems
to
rest
so
lightly
so
tenderly
on
the
earth
as
if
in
a
moment
it
would
soar
into
the
sky
the
beauty
of
the
taj
as
in
all
great
art
lies
in
its
simplicity
one
wonders
that
so
much
beauty
can
come
from
so
little
effort
yet
nothing
is
wanting
nothing
in
excess
one
can
not
alter
this
and
that
and
say
that
it
is
better
the
garden
as
originally
planned
was
an
integral
part
of
one
great
design
the
solemn
rows
of
cypresses
were
planted
so
as
to
help
out
the
lines
of
the
architecture
the
flowering
trees
and
completed
the
harmony
with
a
splendid
glow
of
colour
beautiful
as
the
first
view
of
the
taj
is
even
now
one
can
hardly
realize
how
glorious
it
must
have
been
when
the
whole
intention
of
the
design
was
fulfilled
at
present
there
is
not
a
single
spot
in
the
garden
itself
which
gives
a
view
of
the
composition
as
a
whole
advancing
down
the
main
terrace
paved
with
stone
and
laid
out
with
geometric
we
reach
a
marble
platform
with
its
fountain
see
frontispiece
where
a
nearer
view
of
the
taj
may
be
enjoyed
such
a
platform
was
the
central
feature
in
all
mogul
gardens
the
terraces
to
the
right
and
left
of
it
end
in
two
fine
pavilions
of
red
sandstone
intended
for
the
accommodation
of
the
custodians
of
the
mausoleum
and
for
storehouses
from
this
point
we
can
admire
the
effect
of
the
exquisite
inlaid
decoration
fine
and
precious
as
the
embroidery
on
the
raiment
of
mumtaz
herself
at
the
end
of
the
main
terrace
we
reach
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
great
platform
on
which
the
taj
and
its
minarets
four
tall
court
ladies
tending
their
princess
are
raised
let
us
reverently
enter
the
central
chamber
where
mumtaz
mahal
and
shah
jahan
her
lord
and
lover
lie
fergusson
has
truly
said
no
words
can
express
its
chastened
beauty
seen
in
the
soft
gloom
of
the
subdued
light
coming
from
the
distant
and
openings
the
screen
of
marble
tracery
which
surrounds
the
tombs
is
in
itself
a
masterpiece
even
with
all
the
artistic
resources
which
shah
jahan
had
at
his
command
it
was
a
work
of
ten
years
mumtaz
mahal
lies
in
the
centre
the
white
marble
of
her
tomb
blossoms
with
a
garden
of
persian
flowers
which
the
magic
of
the
mogul
artists
has
created
the
inscription
on
it
is
as
follows
the
illustrious
sepulchre
of
arjumand
banu
begam
called
mumtaz
mahal
died
in
at
the
head
of
the
tomb
is
the
line
he
is
the
everlasting
he
is
sufficient
and
the
following
passage
from
the
koran
god
is
he
besides
whom
there
is
no
god
he
knoweth
what
is
concealed
and
what
is
manifest
he
is
merciful
and
compassionate
on
one
side
of
it
nearer
unto
god
are
those
who
say
lord
is
god
the
inscription
in
the
tomb
of
shah
jahan
is
as
follows
the
illustrious
sepulchre
and
sacred
of
his
most
exalted
majesty
dignified
as
razwan
the
guardian
of
paradise
having
his
abode
in
paradise
and
his
dwelling
in
the
starry
heaven
inhabitant
of
the
regions
of
bliss
the
second
lord
of
the
qirán
shah
jahan
the
king
valiant
may
his
tomb
ever
flourish
and
may
his
abode
be
in
the
heavens
he
travelled
from
this
transitory
world
to
the
world
of
eternity
on
the
night
of
the
of
the
month
of
rajab
the
real
cenotaphs
containing
the
remains
of
shah
jahan
and
his
wife
are
immediately
under
these
tombs
in
the
vault
below
not
the
least
of
the
wonders
of
this
wonderful
building
is
in
its
acoustic
qualities
it
does
not
respond
to
vulgar
noises
but
if
a
few
notes
be
slowly
and
softly
sung
in
this
vault
and
especially
if
the
chord
of
the
seventh
be
sounded
they
are
caught
up
by
the
echoes
of
the
roof
and
repeated
in
endless
harmonies
which
seem
to
those
listening
above
as
if
a
celestial
choir
were
chanting
angelic
hymns
it
haunts
the
air
above
and
around
it
distils
in
showers
upon
the
polished
marble
it
rises
it
falls
it
is
the
very
element
with
which
sweet
dreams
are
builded
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
taj
the
voice
of
inspired
love
surrounding
the
central
chamber
are
eight
smaller
ones
for
the
mullahs
who
chanted
the
koran
and
for
musicians
who
played
soft
indian
and
persian
melodies
the
vault
below
was
only
opened
once
a
year
on
the
anniversary
day
when
the
emperor
and
all
his
court
attended
a
solemn
festival
even
on
ordinary
occasions
none
but
muhammadans
were
admitted
into
the
interior
bernier
tells
us
that
he
had
not
seen
it
on
that
account
but
he
understood
that
nothing
could
be
conceived
more
rich
and
magnificent
the
two
mosques
of
red
sandstone
on
either
side
of
the
taj
are
in
the
same
style
as
the
entrance
gateway
the
interiors
being
decorated
with
fresco
and
fine
cut
the
one
towards
the
west
was
intended
for
prayers
only
the
floor
is
panelled
into
separate
spaces
for
each
worshipper
the
opposite
mosque
was
known
as
the
or
for
the
congregation
before
prayers
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
great
anniversary
service
standing
on
the
platform
in
front
of
this
mosque
one
has
a
splendid
view
of
the
taj
the
river
and
the
distant
fort
as
the
garden
is
now
arranged
a
full
view
of
the
magnificent
platform
with
its
two
mosques
and
the
taj
itself
can
only
be
obtained
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
which
is
not
very
accessible
except
by
boat
when
the
traveller
leaves
agra
by
rail
going
east
the
taj
in
all
its
glory
can
be
seen
in
the
distance
floating
like
the
mirage
of
some
wondrous
fairy
palace
over
the
waving
tufts
of
the
pampas
grass
until
at
last
it
sinks
into
the
pale
horizon
a
small
museum
has
been
established
lately
by
the
archæological
department
in
the
western
half
of
the

main
gateway
it
contains
an
interesting
collection
of
photographs
and
drawings
of
the
taj
at
different
periods
and
specimens
of
the
stones
used
in
the

of

are
also
samples
illustrating
the
technique
of
and
the

used
by
native
workmen

the
tomb
of
the
lord
high
treasurer
is
on
the
east
or
left
bank
of
the
river
and
is
reached
by
crossing
the
pontoon
bridge
it
was
built
by
nur
mahal
the
favourite
wife
of
jahangir
as
a
mausoleum
for
her
father
mirza
ghîas
beg
who
according
to
one
account
was
a
persian
from
teheran
and
by
another
a
native
of
western
tartary
a
story
is
told
of
the
mirza
early
life
of
which
it
can
only
be
said
non
é
vero
é
ben
he
left
his
home
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
children
to
seek
his
fortune
in
india
where
he
had
some
relatives
at
akbar
court
his
slender
provision
for
the
journey
was
exhausted
in
crossing
the
great
desert
and
they
were
all
in
danger
of
perishing
from
hunger
in
this
extremity
his
wife
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
the
unhappy
parents
distracted
by
hunger
and
fatigue
left
the
infant
under
a
solitary
shrub
with
the
father
supporting
his
wife
and
children
on
the
one
bullock
which
remained
to
them
they
pushed
on
in
the
hope
of
finding
relief
but
as
the
tiny
landmark
where
the
infant
lay
disappeared
in
the
distance
the
mother
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
threw
herself
to
the
ground
crying
my
child
my
child
the
piteous
appeal
forced
the
father
to
return
to
restore
the
babe
to
her
mother
and
soon
afterwards
a
caravan
appeared
in
sight
and
rescued
the
whole
party
the
child
born
under
these
romantic
circumstances
became
the
empress
nur
mahal
who
built
this
mausoleum
her
father
reached
lahore
where
akbar
then
held
his
court
and
through
the
influence
of
his
friends
attracted
the
emperor
attention
his
talents
won
for
him
speedy
promotion
and
under
jahangir
he
became
first
lord
high
treasurer
and
afterwards
wazir
or
prime
minister
jahangir
in
his
memoirs
candidly
discusses
the
character
of
his
he
was
a
good
scholar
with
a
pretty
taste
for
poetry
possessed
many
social
qualities
and
a
genial
disposition
his
accounts
were
always
in
perfect
order
but
he
liked
bribes
and
showed
much
boldness
in
demanding
them
on
his
death
his
son
asaf
khan
the
father
of
mumtaz
mahal
was
appointed
to
succeed
him
and
his
wife
are
buried
in
the
central
chamber
his
brother
and
sister
and
other
members
of
his
family

the
four
corners

enclosed
by
beautiful
marble
tracery
plate
ix
contains
only
replicas
of
the
real
tombs
beneath
the
mausoleum
was
commenced
in
and
completed
in
as
a
composition
it
may
lack
inspiration
but
it
is
exceedingly
elegant
and
scholarly
like
the
lord
high
treasurer
himself
in
construction
it
marks
the
transition
from
the
style
of
akbar
to
that
of
shah
jahan
from
the
jahangiri
mahal
to
the
the
mûti
masjid
and
the
taj
the
towers
at
the
four
corners
might
be
the
first
suggestion
of
the
detached
minarets
of
the
taj
the
hindu
feeling
which
is
so
characteristic
of
most
of
akbar
buildings
is
here
only
shown
in
the
roof
of
the
central
chamber
over
the
tomb
in
pure
saracenic
architecture
a
tomb
is
always
covered
by
a
dome
this
change
in
style
greatly
influenced
the
architecture
of
the
whole
of
the
north
of
india
hindu
and
jain
as
well
as
muhammadan
it
must
be
remembered
that
comparatively
few
of
the
who
actually
constructed
the
most
famous
examples
of
mogul
architecture
were
muhammadans
the
remarkable
decline
of
the
mogul
style
which
set
in
under
aurangzîb
was
largely
due
to
his
bigotry
in
refusing
to
employ
any
but
true
believers
the
family
ties
of
and
his
daughter
the
empress
were
closely
connected
with
persia
and
central
asia
and
no
doubt
the
fashion
set
by
jahangir
court
led
to
the
saracenic
element
becoming
predominant
in
the
mogul
style
both
in
construction
and
in
decoration
many
authorities
have
connected
the
marked
difference
between
tomb
and
akbar
buildings
to
italian
influence
only
on
the
ground
that
jahangir
is
known
to
have
been
partial
to
europeans
and
allowed
them
free
access
to
his
palace
there
is
not
however
a
trace
of
italian
art
in
any
detail
of
the
building
there
is
not
a
form
or
decorative
idea
which
had
not
been
used
in
india
or
in
central
asia
for
centuries
the
use
of
marble
inlaid
work
on
so
extensive
a
scale
was
a
novelty
but
it
was
only
an
imitation
or
adaptation
of
the
splendid
and
painted
which
were
the
commonest
kinds
of
decoration
employed
in
persia
wazir
khan
mosque
at
lahore
built
in
jahangir
time
is
a
fine
indian
example
of
the
latter
the
art
of
inlaying
stone
had
been
practised
in
india
for
many
years
before
this
building
but
here
for
the
first
time
do
we
find
the
inlayers
making
attempts
at
direct
imitation
of
persian
pottery
decoration
all
the
familiar
of
persian
art
the
tree
of
life
and
other
floral
types
the
cypress
tree
the
fruits
and
vessels
are
here
reproduced
exactly
as
they
are
found
in
persian
mosaic
tiles
in
shah
jahan
palace
and
in
the
taj
they
went
a
step
further
and
imitated
the
more
naturalistic
treatment
of
persian
fresco
painting
and
other
pictorial
art
but
there
is
never
the
slightest
suggestion
of
european
design
in
the
decoration
of
these
buildings
it
is
quite
possible
that
some
italians
may
have
shown
the
native
inlayers
specimens
of
florentine
and
suggested
to
them
this
naturalistic
treatment
but
if
italians
or
other
europeans
had
been
engaged
to
instruct
or
supervise
in
the
decoration
of
these
buildings
they
would
certainly
have
left
some
traces
of
their
handiwork
in
the
technical
part
of
the
process
the
indian
workmen
had
nothing
to
learn
and
in
the
design
they
made
no
attempt
to
follow
european
forms
except
in
the
one
solitary
instance
of
the
decoration
of
the
of
the
delhi
palace
which
is
much
later
in
date
than
tomb
the
whole
scheme
of
the
exterior
decoration
is
so
finely
carried
out
both
in
arrangement
and
colour
that
its
extreme
elaboration
produces
no
effect
of
unquietness
at
a
distance
it
only
gives
a
suggestion
of
a
soft
bloom
or
iridescence
on
the
surface
of
the
marble
the
soffits
of
the
doorways
are
carved
with
extraordinary
delicacy
inside
the
building
there
are
remains
of
fresco
and
other
painted
decoration
beautifully
placed
on
the
river
bank
there
is
a
fine
little
mosque
which
at
sunset
makes
a
charming
picture
the
boldness
and
greater
simplicity
of
the
decoration
contrast
well
with
the
richness
of
that
of
the
mausoleum
the
beyond
tomb
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
is
a
beautiful
ruin
once
entirely
covered
with
the
same
persian
mosaic
which
suggested
the
more
costly
style
of
decoration
in
inlaid
marble
it
is
called
or
the
china
tomb
and
is
supposed
to
be
the
mausoleum
of
afzal
khan
a
persian
poet
who
entered
the
service
of
jahangir
and
afterwards
became
prime
minister
to
shah
jahan
he
died
in
lahore
in
the
weather
and
of
various
kinds
have
removed
a
great
deal
of
the
exquisite
enamel
colours
from
the
tiles
but
enough
remains
to
indicate
how
rich
and
magnificent
the
effect
must
have
been
originally
a
part
of
the
south
façade
which
has
fallen
in
shows
how
the
builders
employed
earthen
pots
to
lessen
the
weight
of
the
concrete
filling
a
practice
followed
in
the
ancient
dome
construction
of
egypt
and
rome
the
ram
bagh
among
a
number
of
more
or
less
ruined
on
this
bank
of
the
river
there
is
one
a
little
beyond
the
of
especial
interest
on
account
of
the
tradition
which
associates
it
with
the
emperor
babar
it
is
called
the
ram
bagh
and
is
believed
to
have
been
one
of
the
elegant
and
regularly
planned
which
babar
laid
out
and
planted
with
fruit
trees
and
flowers
as
he
has
described
in
his
memoirs
no
doubt
this
was
the
scene
of
many
imperial
picnics
not
the
drunken
revels
of
babar
kabul
days
for
just
before
the
great
battle
with
the
rajputs
in
he
smashed
all
his
gold
and
silver
and
took
a
vow
of
total
abstinence
which
he
kept
faithfully
but
the
more
sane
and
temperate
pleasures
which
music
poetry
and
his
intense
delight
in
the
beauties
of
nature
could
furnish
here
is
a
charming
picture
he
has
given
of
another
garden
he
laid
out
in
the
istalif
district
of
kabul
on
the
outside
of
the
garden
are
large
and
beautiful
spreading
under
the
shade
of
which
there
are
agreeable
spots
finely
sheltered
a
perennial
stream
large
enough
to
turn
a
mill
runs
through
the
garden
and
on
its
banks
are
planted
plane
and
other
trees
formerly
this
stream
flowed
in
a
winding
and
crooked
course
but
i
ordered
its
course
to
be
altered
according
to
a
plan
which
added
greatly
to
the
beauty
of
the
place
lower
down
on
the
lower
skirts
of
the
hills
is
a
fountain
named
kwâjeh
three
friends
around
which
are
three
species
of
trees
above
the
fountain
are
many
beautiful
plane
trees
which
yield
a
pleasant
shade
on
the
two
sides
of
the
fountain
on
small
eminences
at
the
bottom
of
the
hills
there
are
a
number
of
oak
trees
except
on
these
two
spots
where
there
are
groves
of
oak
there
is
not
an
oak
to
be
met
with
on
the
hills
of
the
west
of
kabul
in
front
of
this
fountain
towards
the
plain
there
are
many
spots
covered
with
the
flowering
arghwân
tree
and
besides
these
arghwân
plots
there
are
none
else
in
the
whole
country
it
is
said
that
these
three
kinds
of
trees
were
bestowed
on
it
by
the
power
of
these
three
holy
men
beloved
of
god
and
that
is
the
origin
of
the
name
i
directed
this
fountain
to
be
built
round
with
stone
and
formed
a
cistern
of
lime
and
mortar
ten
yez
by
ten
on
the
four
sides
of
the
fountain
a
fine
level
platform
for
resting
was
constructed
on
a
very
neat
plan
at
the
time
when
the
arghwân
flowers
begin
to
blow
i
do
not
know
of
any
place
in
the
world
to
be
compared
with
it
the
yellow
arghwân
is
here
very
abundant
and
the
yellow
arghwân
blossom
mingles
with
the
red
the
ram
bagh
was
the
temporary
of
the
body
of
babar
before
it
was
taken
to
kabul
for
interment
in
another
of
the
gardens
he
loved
so
much
the
old
mogul
style
of
gardening
is
a
lost
art
and
one
misses
in
the
ram
bagh
the
stately
rows
of
cypress
interspersed
with
flowering
trees
the
formal
glowing
with
colour
like
a
living
carpet

the

buried
about
a
mile
further
along

on
the
side
is
a
curious
statue
of
a
horse
in

with
the
adjacent
ruined

are
attributed
to

akbar
tomb
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
garden
enclosed
by
four
high
battlemented
walls
in
the
centre
of
each
wall
is
an
imposing
gateway
seventy
feet
high
the
principal
one
on
the
west
side
has
an
inscription
in
persian
which
states
that
the
mausoleum
was
completed
by
the
emperor
jahangir
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
reign
or
it
is
elaborately
ornamented
with
bold
but
rather
disjointed
inlaid
patterns
which
seem
to
show
that
the
designers
were
unaccustomed
to
this
method
of
decoration
neither
are
the
four
minarets
at
the
corners
of
the
roof
which
are
said
to
have
been
broken
by
the
jâts
contrived
with
the
usual
skill
of
the
mogul
architects
above
the
gateway
is
the
nakkár
khana
an
arcaded
chamber
with
a
balcony
where
at
dawn
and
one
watch
after
sunrise
the
drums
and
pipes
sounded
in
honour
of
the
dead
the
mausoleum
was
commenced
by
akbar
himself
it
is
different
in
plan
from
any
other
mogul
monument
and
contrary
to
the
usual
muhammadan
custom
the
head
of
the
tomb
of
akbar
is
turned
towards
the
rising
sun
and
not
towards
mecca
the
whole
structure
gives
the
impression
of
a
noble
but
incompleted
idea
both
in
its
greatness
and
in
its
incompleteness
it
is
typical
of
akbar
and
his
work
the
original
design
was
somewhat
modified
by
jahangir
he
has
stated
in
his
memoirs
that
on
his
first
visit
to
the
tomb
after
his
accession
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
work
which
had
been
done
and
ordered
certain
parts
of
it
to
be
rebuilt
fergusson
supposes
that
the
original
intention
was
to
cover
the
tombstone
and
raised
platform
of
the
uppermost
story
with
a
domed
canopy
and
in
this
he
is
supported
by
a
statement
of
william
finch
who
visited
the
mausoleum
when
it
was
being
built
that
it
was
to
be
inarched
over
with
the
most
curious
white
and
speckled
marble
to
be
ceiled
all
within
with
pure
sheet
gold
richly
inwrought
such
a
canopy
is
just
what
is
required
by
æsthetic
considerations
to
complete
the
curiously
truncated
appearance
of
the
top
story
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
structural
design
to
make
it
impossible
or
improbable
the
approach
to
the
interior
of
the
mausoleum
is
through
the
central
archway
of
the
lower
story
which
opens
into
a
vestibule
richly
ornamented
with
raised
stucco
work
and
coloured
in
blue
and
gold
somewhat
in
the
style
of
the
alhambra
a
part
of
this
decoration
has
been
lately
restored
an
inclined
passage
like
the
entrance
to
an
egyptian
pyramid
leads
down
into
a
high
vaulted
chamber
dimly
lighted
from
above
where
a
simple
sarcophagus
of
white
marble
contains
the
mortal
remains
of
the
great
akbar
whatever
decoration
there
may
have
been
on
the
walls
is
now
covered
with
whitewash
the
emperor
armour
clothes
and
books
which
were
placed
beside
the
tomb
are
said
to
have
been
carried
off
by
those
insatiable
marauders
the
jâts
of
bharatpur
smaller
chambers
surrounding
the
central
one
on
the
level
of
the
platform
contain
the
tombs
of
two
of
akbar
daughters
and
a
son
of
the
emperor
shah
alam
these
also
have
suffered
much
from
neglect
and
whitewash
the
whole
of
the
façade
of
the
lower
story
was
originally
faced
with
red
sandstone
or
perhaps
with
fine
stucco
decorated
in
fresco
the
present
coat
of
common
plaster
is
modern
work
which
except
as
a
protection
for
the
brickwork
would
have
been
better
left
undone
the
lower
story
is
feet
square
above
this
are
three
others
diminishing
in
size
up
to
the
highest
which
is
just
half
these
dimensions
the
roof
of
the
topmost
is
surrounded
by
cloisters
the
outer
arches
of
which
are
filled
with
very
fine
marble
tracery
plate
in
the
centre
on
a
raised
platform
is
a
solid
block
of
pure
white
marble
delicately
carved
with
flowers
and
sacred
texts
representing
the
real
tomb
in
the
vault
beneath
at
the
head
is
the
inscription
god
is
great
and
at
the
foot
jalli
jalalohu
magnificent
is
his
glory
these
sentences
were
the
formula
of
akbar
new
religion
which
he
called
the
divine
faith
on
the
sides
the
attributes
of
god
are
carved
in
the
arabic
character
the
carved
marble
pedestal
at
the
end
of
the
tomb
was
a
stand
for
a
golden
censer
the
kanch
outside
the
enclosure
of
akbar
tomb
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
principal
entrance
is
a
rare
and
remarkably
fine
example
of
mogul
domestic
architecture
this
is
a
building
known
as
the
kanch
mahal
and
supposed
to
have
been
built
by
jahangir
as
a
country
seat
in
its
extremely
elaborate
ornamentation
inlaid
stone
and
enamelled
tiles
have
been
most
effectively
combined
with
the
carving
the
repairs
lately
carried
out
under
lord
curzon
orders
have
been
very
carefully
done
though
it
is
easy
to
see
the
inferiority
of
the
new
work
where
the
old
carving
had
to
be
reproduced
our
fatuous
policy
of
adopting
european
styles
in
all
public
buildings
in
india
is
bound
to
cause
a
deterioration
in
the
native
art
handicrafts
for
it
closes
the
principal
source
from
which
they
have
sprung
unless
this
policy
is
reversed
nothing
will
prevent
the
ultimate
extinction
of
indian
art
this
is
another
building
of
about
the

period

not
quite
so
fine

the

have
reached
up
to

accounts
for

by

a

stabled
his

in

fatehpur

the

about
miles
from

it

formerly
merely
a

celebrated
as
the
abode
of

a
muhammadan
or
saint
in

returning

halted
near

lived
the
twin
children
of
his
rajput

mariam
zâmâni
had
recently
died
and
he
was
anxious
for
an
heir
he
consulted
the
holy
man
who
advised
him
to
come
and
live
at
sikri
the
emperor
did
so
and
nine
months
afterwards
mariam
who
was
taken
to

confinement
gave
birth
to

afterwards
the

he
was
called
sultan
salîm
in
honour
of
the
saint
jahangir
who
describes
all
these
circumstances
in
his
memoirs
adds
my
revered
father
regarding
the
village
of
sikri
my
birthplace
as
fortunate
to
himself
made
it
his
capital
and
in
the
course
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
the
hills
and
deserts
which
abounded
in
beasts
of
prey
became
converted
into
a
magnificent
city
comprising
numerous
gardens
elegant
edifices
and
pavilions
and
other
places
of
great
attraction
and
beauty
after
the
conquest
of
gujarat
the
village
was
named
fatehpur
the
town
of
victory
the
glory
of
fatehpur
sikri
was
akbar
held
his
court
there
for
seventeen
years
and
then
removed
it
to
agra
some
say
on
account
of
the
badness
of
the
water
supply
others
that
the
saint
disturbed
in
his
devotions
by
the
bustle
and
gaieties
of
the
great
city
declared
that
either
he
or
akbar
must
go
then
replied
the
emperor
let
it
be
your
servant
i
pray
the
entire
city
was
given
up
to
the
beasts
of
the
surrounding
jungle
finch
who
visited
it
in
the
early
part
of
the
next
reign
describes
it
ruin
all
lying
like
a
waste
desert
and
very
dangerous
to
pass
through
in
the
night
this
however
was
an
exaggeration
for
the
principal
buildings
are
still
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
probably
owing
to
the
remoteness
of
the
place
from
any
great
highway
or
large
town
the
city
which
was
some
six
miles
in
circuit
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
high
battlemented
walls
which
had
nine
gateways
the
fourth
side
was
formed
by
a
great
artificial
lake
now
dry

are
on
the
summit
of
the
high
ridge
which
runs
throughout
the
length
of
the
city
the
agra
the
visitor
usually
enters
by
the
agra
gate
concerning
which
an
amusing
story
is
told
one
night
akbar
attended
by
some
of
his
ministers
was
inspecting
the
ramparts
near
this
gate
when
he
observed
a
highway
robbery
being
committed
close
by
the
walls
turning
severely
to
those
responsible
for
the
peace
of
the
city
he
demanded
why
such
an
outrage
was
permitted
in
the
very
presence
of
the
emperor
it
is
always
darkest
directly
under
the
shadow
of

lamp
was
the
courtly
reply
the

inside
the
gate
the

passes
by

a
large
quadrangle
surrounded
by
a
ruined
cloister

was
probably
used
for

as
in

musicians
played
to
announce
the
arrival

departure
and
various
state
ceremonials
the
some
distance
beyond
the
naubat
khana
on

is
a
large

to
have
been

silver
and
copper
coins
from
the
fatehpur
mint
are
in
the
british
museum
the
brick
domes
of
this
building
are
interesting
as
they
are
probably
the
earliest
examples
in
india
of
the
use
of
radiating
courses
instead
of
horizontal

probably

the
kwâbgâh
or

is
a
small
pavilion
on
the
roof
originally
the
walls
were
entirely
covered
by
fresco
paintings
but
only
a
few
fragments
now
remain
unfortunately
these
have
been
protected
by
a
coat
of
varnish
which
reduces
them
all
to
a
dull
monochrome
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
a
more
scientific
method
of
preserving
them
was
not
adopted
they
are
all
in
the
persian
style
and
except
for
the
chinese
element
which
is
often
present
in
persian
art
there
is
no
ground
for
edmund
smith
supposition
that
chinese
artists
were
employed
here
on
the

window
over
the
eastern
doorway
is
a
painting
of
a
winged
figure
in
front
of
a
rock
cave
supporting
a
babe
in
its
arms
in
all
probability
it
refers
to
the
birth
of
jahangir
in
the
cell
of
the
saint
salîm
chishti
which
akbar
no
doubt
thought
miraculous
many
archæologists
make
the
great
mistake
of
attributing
every
winged
figure
in
these
decorations
to
some
biblical
story
heavenly
beings
with
wings
the
inhabitants
of
paradise
spirits
of
the
air
or
angels
are
very
common
in
persian
and
indian
painting
and
are
by
no
means
a
monopoly
of
european
artists
it
is
known
that
akbar
took
a
great
interest
in
painting
abul
fazl
in
the
states
that
his
majesty
from
the
earliest
youth
has
shown
a
great
predilection
for
the
art
and
gives
it
every
encouragement
as
he
looks
upon
it
as
a
means
both
of
study
and
amusement
hence
the
art
flourishes
and
many
painters
have
obtained
great
reputations
the
works
of
all
painters
are
weekly
laid
before
his
majesty
by
the
daroghas
and
the
clerks
he
confers
rewards
according
to
the
excellence
of
workmanship
or
increases
their
monthly
salaries
much
progress
was
made
in
the
commodities
required
by
painters
and
the
correct
prices
of
such
articles
were
carefully
ascertained
akbar
himself
remarked
bigoted
followers
of
the
law
are
hostile
to
the
art
of
painting
but
their
eyes
now
see
the
truth
there
are
many
that
hate
painting
but
such
men
i
dislike
it
appears
to
me
as
if
a
painter
had
a
peculiar
means
of
recognizing
god
for
a
painter
in
sketching
anything
that
has
life
and
in
drawing
its
limbs
must
feel
that
he
can
not
bestow
personality
upon
his
work
and
is
thus
forced
to
think
of
god
the
giver
of
life
and
will
thus
increase
his
knowledge
the
enlightened
court
of
akbar
was
evidently
a
paradise
for
artists
opposite
to
akbar
apartments
is
a
large
square
tank
with
a
platform
in
the
centre
approached
by
four
narrow
stone
paths
the
tank
was
filled
from
the
waterworks
near
the
elephant
gate
and
the
water
was
kept
constantly
fresh
by
an
overflow
channel
connecting
with
the
tank
at
the
back
of
the
the
turkish
sultana
in
the
angle
of
the
quadrangle
is
a
small
picturesque
building
one
of
the
gems
of
fatehpur
called
the
turkish
sultana
house
it
contains
only
a
single
apartment
surrounded
by
a
verandah
but
in
the
carving
of
every
surface
within
and
without
there
is
a
wealth
of
invention
and
decorative
skill
rarely
achieved
even
by
the
mogul
artists
the
dado
panels
are
especially
remarkable
for
the
charming
conventionalized
rendering
of
trees
flowers
birds
and
animals
they
have
suffered
much
from
the
hands
of
some
of
aurangzîb
fanatical
followers
and
all
the
representations
of
animate
nature
have
been
mutilated
the
carving
was
intended
as
a
groundwork
for
painting
and
gilding
which
were
never
added
for
the
fatehpur
palace
was
abandoned
even
before
it
was
finished
nothing
is
known
with
certainty
of
the
lady
who
inhabited
this
delightful
bower
but
she
must
have
been
one
of
favourites
a
covered
passage
connected
the
house
with
the
kwâbgâh
and
also
with
another
block
of
buildings
of
no
special
interest
known
as
the
girls
school
a
staircase
from
the
south
verandah
leads
down
to
some
interesting
baths
outside
the
corner
of
the
quadrangle
which
were
probably
for
the
use
of
the
turkish
sultana
they
are
worth
seeing
though
not
so
fine
as
the
hakim
baths
the
latter
which
are
situated
just
opposite
to
these
baths
on
the
steep
slope
of
the
ridge
are
the
finest
of
their
kind
existing
in
india
they
form
an
extensive
hydropathic
establishment
decorated
in
the
most
excellent
taste
with
polished
plaster
and
or
work
undoubtedly
they
were
used
by
akbar
himself
and
they
derive
their
present
name
from
their
close
proximity
to
the
quarters
occupied
by
the
hakims
or
doctors
pachisi
in
the
northern
half
of
the
great
palace
quadrangle
is
a
board
cut
on
the
pavement
similar
to
the
one
in
the
samman
burj
in
the
agra
fort
here
akbar
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
would
amuse
themselves
by
playing
the
game
with
slave
girls
as
living
pieces
the
dice
were
thrown
on
the
small
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
board
the
further
towards
the
north
immediately
opposite
to
the
kwâbgâh
is
a
square
detached
building
a
fine
example
of
the
dignified
style
of
the
period
for
it
owes
none
of
its
effects
to
imposing
dimensions
but
only
to
the
skill
with
which
the
architect
has
treated
a
difficult
subject
this
is
the
or
hall
of
private
audience
on
the
outside
it
would
appear
to
be
a
building
but
on
entering
it
is
seen
to
contain
only
a
single
vaulted
chamber
surrounded
halfway
up
by
a
gallery
a
magnificent
carved
column
with
a
gigantic
bracket
capital
plate
xi
standing
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
supports
four
branches
or
railed
passages
which
meet
this
gallery
at
the
four
corners
this
most
original
construction
carried
akbar
throne
which
was
placed
immediately
over
the
great
column
the
ministers
attended
at
the
four
corners
of
the
gallery
the
great
nobles
and
others
admitted
to
the
audience
thronged
the
floor
beneath
the
gallery
is
approached
by
two
staircases
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
which
also
lead
up
to
the
roof
the
close
by
the
on
the
west
side
is
a
building
which
the
native
guides
always
ready
to
amuse
the
innocent
tourist
describe
as
the
or
buff
house
there
is
a
legend
that
akbar
here
played
with
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
the
same
story
is
told
about
a
set
of
apartments
in
the
jahangiri
mahal
in
the
agra
fort
but
the
only
ground
for
it
seems
to
be
that
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
might
lend
itself
to
such
diversions
it
most
probably
contained
for
the
safe
custody
of
valuables
either
state
archives
or
jewels
the
yogi
at
the
corner
of
the
is
a
square
platform
covered
by
a
domed
canopy
the
great
carved
brackets
which
support
the
architraves
are
very
characteristic
of
jaina
construction
this
was
the
seat
of
one
of
the
yogis
or
hindu
fakirs
who
enjoyed
the
emperor
favour
akbar
devoted
much
attention
to
the
occult
powers
claimed
by
these
men
he
even
practised
alchemy
and
showed
in
public
some
of
the
gold
made
by
him
the
adjoining
the
are
the
remains
of
a
long
low
building
which
was
the
hospital
a
few
of
the
wards
still
remain
possibly
this
was
arranged
on
the
model
of
the
hospital
which
akbar
allowed
the
jesuit
fathers
to
build
in
the
city
he
also
permitted
them
to
construct
a
small
chapel
the
records
of
the
missionaries
tell
us
that
akbar
once
came
there
alone
removed
his
turban
and
offered
prayers
first
kneeling
in
the
christian
manner
then
prostrating
himself
according
to
the
muhammadan
custom
and
finally
after
the
ritual
of
the
hindus
one
of
the
christian
congregation
having
died
about
this
time
he
granted
permission
for
the
funeral
procession
to
pass
through
the
streets
of
fatehpur
with
all
the
ceremonies
of
the
catholic
faith
many
of
the
inhabitants
both
hindus
and
muhammadans
attended
the
funeral
akbar
was
never
persuaded
to
become
a
convert
to
christianity
nor
does
there
appear
to
be
any
ground
for
the
belief
that
one
of
his
wives
was
a
christian
the
the
west
side
of
the
hall
of
public
audience
and
its
cloisters
coincide
for
the
whole
length
with
the
east
of
the
palace
quadrangle
the
description
already
given
of
the
at
agra
will
explain
the
functions
for
which
this
building
was
intended
the
throne
or
judgment
seat
of
akbar
was
placed
between
two
pierced
stone
screens
in
the
verandah
in
front
of
the
hall
the
panch
this
curious
pavilion
is
nearly
opposite
to
the
it
is
approached
by
a
staircase
from
the
each
story
was
originally
enclosed
by
pierced
stone
screens
this
and
the
fact
that
the
whole
building
overlooked
the
palace
zanana
make
it
tolerably
certain
that
it
could
only
have
been
used
as
a
promenade
by
akbar
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
the
which
was
divided
into
cubicles
by
screens
between
the
columns
may
as
keene
suggests
have
been
intended
for
the
royal
children
and
their
attendants
the
building
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
invention
and
taste
shown
in
the
varied
designs
of
the
columns
in
which
the
three
principal
styles
of
northern
india
the
hindu
jain
and
saracenic
are
indiscriminately
combined
miriam
another
doorway
in
the
west
side
of
the
palace
quadrangle
leads
to
miriam
house
a
very
elegant
building
showing
marked
hindu
feeling
in
the
design
the
râma
incarnation
of
vishnu
appears
on
one
of
the
carved
brackets
of
the
verandah
it
seems
to
have
derived
its
name
from
akbar
hindu
wife
mariam
zâmâni
the
mother
of
jahangir
her
name
literally
means
mary
of
the
age
a
common
designation
used
by
muhammadan
women
in
honour
of
the
mother
of
jesus
this
has
led
to
the
fable
that
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
christian
wife
of
akbar
the
whole
building
was
originally
covered
with
fresco
paintings
and
gilding
and
was
hence
called
the
sonahra
makân
or
golden
house
the
frescoes
are
supposed
to
illustrate
great
epic
the
shahnama
or
history
of
the
kings
of
persia
as
in
the
kwâbgâh
the
fragments
which
remain
have
been
covered
with
varnish
as
a
preservative
which
has
had
the
effect
of
destroying
all
the
charm
of
colour
they
once
possessed
and
will
eventually
when
the
varnish
turns
brown
with
age
obliterate
them
altogether
the
paintings
are
all
in
the
style
of
the
persian
artists
who
were
employed
by
akbar
to
illustrate
his
books
and
to
paint
the
portraits
of
his
court
over
the
doorway
in
the
angle
of
the
building
is
a
painting
which
the
guides
perhaps
misled
by
the
suggestion
of
some
uninformed
traveller
point
out
as
the
annunciation
there
would
be
nothing
improbable
that
akbar
should
have
caused
some
events
of
biblical
history
to
be
painted
on
the
walls
of
his
palaces
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
connect
this
fresco
with
the
annunciation
the
winged
figures
here
represented
are
of
the
type
commonly
found
in
paintings
of
stories
from
persian
mythology
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
paintings
is
a
portrait
in
a
panel
in
one
of
the
rooms
one
would
like
to
know
whether
this
was
the
lady
of
the
house
but
there
seems
to
be
no
tradition
connected
with
it
judging
from
the
style
of
the
frescoes
it
would
seem
probable
that
this
was
not
the
residence
of
mariam
zâmâni
but
of
one
of
first
two
wives
whose
connections
were
mostly
with
persia
jodh
bai
palace
though
miriam
house
is
generally
regarded
as
the
abode
of
mariam
zâmâni
there
is
a
great
deal
to
support
the
view
that
the
spacious
palace
known
as
jodh
bai
mahal
or
jahangiri
mahal
was
really
her
residence
it
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
fatehpur
we
know
that
akbar
went
there
on
mariam
account
and
after
jahangir
birth
akbar
first
care
would
be
to
build
a
palace
for
the
mother
and
her
child
his
heir
mariam
was
a
hindu
and
this
palace
in
all
its
construction
and
nearly
all
its
ornamentation
belongs
to
the
hindu
and
jaina
styles
of
mariam
native
country
rajputana
it
even
contains
a
hindu
temple
it
is
also
the
most
important
of
all
the
palaces
and
mariam
as
mother
of
the
would
take
precedence
of
all
the
other
wives
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
is
a
small
a
simple
but
finely
proportioned
gateway
leads
through
a
vestibule
into
the
inner
quadrangle
the
style
of
the
whole
palace
is
much
less
ornate
than
the
other
zanana
buildings
but
it
is
always
dignified
and
in
excellent
taste
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
severity
of
the
architectural
design
was
relieved
by
bright
colouring
and
rich
purdahs
which
were
used
to
secure
privacy
for
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
and
to
diminish
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
archæologically
its
construction
and
ornamentation
are
very
interesting
many
of
the
details
are
of
jain
origin
and
of
the
same
type
as
the
mixed
jain
and
saracenic
style
which
was
being
developed
about
the
same
period
in
gujarat
the
arrangements
of
the
palace
are
shown
in
the
annexed
plan
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
is
the
hawa
mahal
a
pavilion
projecting
from
the
north
side
enclosed
by
pierced
stone
screens
here
the
ladies
could
enjoy
the
cool
breezes
and
the
view
of
the
lake
with
the
distant
hills
beyond
without
being
exposed
to
the
vulgar
gaze
the
palace
was
formerly
connected
with
akbar
private
apartments
by
a
covered
way
supported
on
pillars
near
the
entrance
this
was
removed
some
years
ago
another
private
passage
led
from
the
hawa
mahal
to
the
zanana
garden
opposite
and
probably
from
thence
right
down
to
the
tower
known
as
the
hiran
minâr
rajah
birbal
house
or
birbal
daughter
house
rajah
birbal
was
a
brahman
minstrel
who
came
to
akbar
court
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
and
by
his
wit
and
abilities
gained
the
emperor
favour
he
was
first
created
hindu
poet
laureate
from
that
dignity
he
was
raised
to
the
rank
of
rajah
and
became
one
of
akbar
most
intimate
friends
and
advisers
birbal
was
one
of
those
who
subscribed
to
akbar
new
religion
the
divine
faith
when
he
perished
in
an
unfortunate
expedition
against
some
unruly
afghan
tribes
akbar
grief
was
for
a
long
time
inconsolable
the
house
which
is
named
after
him
was
originally
enclosed
within
the
precincts
of
the
imperial
zanana
and
a
covered
way
connected
it
with
jodh
bai
palace
it
is
one
of
the
most
richly
decorated
of
all
the
adjacent
buildings
and
next
to
jodh
bai
palace
the
largest
of
the
imperial
residences
as
in
so
many
other
instances
the
vague
local
tradition
which
assigns
this
palace
to
rajah
birbal
seems
to
be
at
fault
abul
fazl
that
most
careful
and
precise
biographer
records
that
akbar
ordered
a
palace
to
be
built
for
the
rajah
and
that
when
it
was
finished
in
the
year
of
his
reign
the
emperor
honoured
it
with
his
presence
an
inscription
discovered
by
edmund
smith
upon
the
capital
of
a
pilaster
in
the
west
façade
of
the
building
states
that
it
was
erected
in
samvat
ten
years
before
this
date
and
three
years
after
the
commencement
of
the
city
though
the
rajah
was
one
of
akbar
most
trusted
friends
his
palace
would
hardly
be
placed
within
the
enclosure
of
the
emperor
own
zanana
and
connected
with
it
nor
is
it
likely
that
akbar
would
provide
birbal
with
a
residence
so
incomparably
more
magnificent
than
those
he
gave
to
his
other
two
intimate
friends
abul
fazl
and
faizi
by
the
side
of
the
great
mosque
all
the
probabilities
are
that
this
was
one
of
the
imperial
palaces
occupied
by
akbar
wives
which
were
the
first
buildings
erected
at
fatehpur
fergusson
assumption
that
birbal
daughter
was
one
of
akbar
wives
would
explain
everything
but
the
fact
that
abul
fazl
makes
no
mention
of
such
a
daughter
is
very
good
evidence
that
akbar
was
not
connected
with
birbal
by
marriage
the
house
is
a
building
splendidly
ornamented
with
carving
both
inside
and
out
from
the
construction
it
would
appear
that
hindus
were
the
architects
but
the
decoration
from
which
it
is
easy
to
discover
the
taste
of
the
occupants
is
nearly
all
arabian
or
persian
in
style
and
conveys
no
suggestion
that
the
palace
was
built
for
a
hindu
rajah
or
his
daughter
though
on
a
much
smaller
scale
it
is
of
the
same
type
as
akbar
splendid
palace
in
the
agra
fort
and
was
evidently
intended
for
one
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
imperial
zanana
the
hathi
pol
and
adjoining
buildings
close
under
birbal
house
is
the
main
road
leading
down
to
the
great
lake
now
drained
the
embankment
of
which
formed
the
boundary
of
the
city
it
passes
through
the
gateway
called
the
hathi
pol
or
elephant
gate
from
the
two
great
stone
elephants
mutilated
by
aurangzîb
standing
on
either
side
of
the
outer
archway
on
the
left
of
the
gateway
are
two
buildings
the
pigeon
house
probably
intended
for
a
magazine
and
the
sangin
burj
a
great
bastion
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
fortifications
begun
by
akbar
and
left
unfinished
owing
to
the
objections
of
shaikh
salîm
chishti
a
little
beyond
this
on
the
right
are
the
remains
of
the
waterworks
which
supplied
the
whole
city
opposite
to
these
is
the
great
traveller
or
in
a
very
ruined
state
the
furthest
of
this
block
of
buildings
is
a
curious
tower
called
the
hiran
minâr
or
deer
tower
feet
in
height
ornamented
with
stone
imitations
of
elephant
tusks
according
to
tradition
it
was
built
by
akbar
in
memory
of
a
favourite
elephant
and
used
by
him
as
a
shooting
tower
the
plain
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
being
the
haunt
of
antelope
and
other
game
the
splendid
stretch
of
water
six
miles
long
and
two
in
breadth
induced
many
of
the
princes
and
nobles
to
build
pavilions
and
garden
houses
on
this
side
of
the
city
this
was
the
place
for
great
tournaments
and
festivities
and
in
the
palmy
days
of
fatehpur
all
the
chivalry
of
the
mogul
court
must
have
made
a
brave
show
here
the
hiran
minâr
was
connected
with
the
zanana
by
a
covered
way
so
that
the
ladies
might
assist
at
these
spectacles
and
enjoy
the
cool
breezes
from
the
lake
the
jâmi
masjid
or
cathedral
mosque
the
great
mosque
of
fatehpur
is
worthy
of
its
founder
lofty
ideals
and
nobility
of
soul
it
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
of
all
buildings
the
historic
associations
connected
with
it
combine
with
its
architectural
splendour
to
make
it
one
of
the
most
impressive
of
its
kind
in
the
world
it
is
said
to
be
copied
from
one
at
mecca
but
this
can
not
be
altogether
true
because
though
the
plan
and
general
design
follow
muhammadan
precedent
many
of
the
details
show
akbar
hindu
proclivities
within
the
great
mosque
akbar
frequently
held
religious
discussions
with
the
learned
doctors
of
islam
and
here
also
after
the
chief
mullahs
had
signed
the
famous
document
which
declared
akbar
to
be
head
of
the
church
the
emperor
mounted
the
pulpit
and
stood
before
the
congregation
as
the
expounder
of
the
divine
faith
he
commenced
to
read
a
or
litany
which
faizi
abul
fazl
brother
had
composed
for
the
occasion
the
lord
who
gave
to
us
dominion
wisdom
and
heart
and
strength
who
guided
us
in
truth
and
right
and
cleansed
our
mind
from
all
but
right
none
can
describe
his
power
or
state
allahú
akbar
god
is
great
but
before
he
could
finish
three
lines
of
it
the
sense
of
the
tremendous
responsibility
he
had
undertaken
overpowered
him
he
descended
the
pulpit
trembling
with
emotion
and
left
the
imam
of
the
mosque
to
continue
the
service
there
are
two
entrances
approached
by
broad
flights
of
steps
the
one
on
the
east
side
is
the
emperor
gate
by
which
akbar
entered
the
mosque
from
the
palace
and
the
other
the
majestic
baland
darwaza
or
high
gate
which
towers
above
everything
on
the
south
side
and
even
dwarfs
the
mosque
itself
with
its
giant
proportions
the
latter
gate
however
was
not
a
part
of
the
original
design
but
was
added
many
years
after
the
completion
of
the
mosque
to
celebrate
victorious
campaign
in
the
deccan
the
mosque
itself
was
built
in
honour
of
the
saint
of
fatehpur
sheikh
salîm
chishti
whose
tomb
enclosed
in
a
shrine
of
white
marble
carved
with
the
delicacy
of
glitters
like
silver
on
the
right
of
the
quadrangle
barren
women
both
hindu
and
muhammadan
tie
bits
of
string
or
shreds
of
cloth
to
the
marble
as
tokens
that
if
blessed
with
a
son
they
will
present
an
offering
to
the
shrine
close
by
is
a
plainer
but
much
larger
mausoleum
for
his
grandson
nawab
islam
khan
who
was
made
governor
of
bengal
by
jahangir
this
also
contains
the
remains
of
many
other
of
the
sheikh
male
descendants
a
separate
vault
called
the
zanana
rauza
for
the
women
of
his
family
is
formed
by
enclosing
a
portion
of
the
adjoining
cloisters
the
mosque
proper
contains
three
chapels
crowned
by
domes
the
principal
one
in
the
centre
is
screened
by
the
façade
of
the
entrance
the
doorway
being
recessed
in
the
usual
style
of
saracenic
buildings
in
a
great
porch
or
an
inscription
over
the
main
archway
gives
the
date
of
the
completion
of
the
mosque
as
the
chapels
are
connected
with
each
other
by
noble
colonnades
of
a
decidedly
hindu
or
jain
character
the
saracenic
arches
combine
most
happily
with
the
hindu
construction
and
the
view
down
the
aisles
is
singularly
impressive
much
of
the
charm
of
the
interior
is
due
to
the
quiet
reserve
and
dignity
of
the
decoration
which
is
nearly
all
in
the
style
of
arabian
mosques
and
may
account
for
the
statement
on
the
central
arch
that
this
mosque
is
a
duplicate
of
the
holy
place
at
mecca
at
each
end
of
the
mosque
there
is
a
set
of
five
rooms
for
the
mullahs
who
conducted
the
service
above
them
are
galleries
for
the
ladies
of
the
zanana
spacious
cloisters
surround
three
sides
of
the
quadrangle
these
are
divided
into
numerous
cells
for
the
and
their
pupils
the
triumphal
gateway
called
the
baland
darwaza
plate
xiii
is
really
a
building
in
itself
it
must
be
seen
from
the
outside
of
the
quadrangle
for
magnificent
as
it
is
there
it
certainly
does
not
harmonize
with
the
mosque
viewed
from
the
quadrangle
this
mighty
portal
feet
in
height
from
the
roadway
is
a
landmark
for
miles
around
from
the
top
of
it
the
taj
miles
away
and
the
distant
fort
of
bharatpur
are
visible
there
are
three
doors
recessed
in
the
immense
alcove
on
the
front
of
the
gate
one
is
the
horseshoe
door
so
called
from
the
numerous
votive
offerings
of
owners
of
sick
horses
donkeys
and
bullocks
which
were
nailed
on
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
the
favour
of
the
saint
the

akbar
himself
died
four
years
after
this
great
sermon
in
stone
was
written
the
mosque
at
the
back
of
the
great
mosque
is
a
graveyard
containing
the
tomb
of
an
infant
son
of
sheikh
salîm
the
legend
concerning
him
is
that
at
the
age
of
six
months
he
addressed
his
father
telling
him
that
all
of
akbar
children
must
die
in
infancy
unless
some
child
died
for
them
he
therefore
had
resolved
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
sake
and
immediately
after
this
miraculous
speech
he
died
jahangir
was
born
nine
months
afterwards
sceptics
have
suggested
that
he
was
really
a
son
of
the
sheikh
substituted
for
a
child
of
mariam
zâmâni
some
distance
beyond
this
tomb
there
is
a
small
mosque
built
in
honour
of
the
saint
by
the
quarrymen
of
fatehpur
before
he
had
attracted
the
notice
of
the
great
emperor
it
is
called
the
mosque
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
erected
on
the
site
of
the
cave
where
he
lived
the
life
of
a
hermit
it
is
an
unpretending
little
building
the
brackets
which
support
the
cornice
are
the
only
noticeable
architectural
features
they
are
direct
imitations
of
wooden
construction
and
are
copied
with
greater
elaboration
of
carving
in
the
marble
shrine
inside
the
jâmi
masjid
the
cell
where
the
saint
is
said
to
have
lived
is
on
the
corner
of
the
mosque
the
birthplace
of
jahangir
is
pointed
out
in
a
dilapidated
palace
not
far
from
this
mosque
it
is
occupied
by
a
lineal
descendant
of
salîm
chishti
and
is
only
rarely
shown
to
visitors
the
houses
of
abul
fazl
and
faizi
the
houses
where
these
two
famous
brothers
the
friends
of
akbar
lived
are
close
under
the
north
wall
of
the
great
mosque
their
father
sheikh
mubarak
was
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
the
age
and
the
sons
were
as
distinguished
as
the
father
faizi
was
the
persian
poet
laureate
and
tutor
to
the
royal
princes
he
was
also
employed
on
many
diplomatic
missions
abul
fazl
was
the
author
of
the
celebrated
akbarnâma
a
history
of
the
mogul
emperors
down
to
the
year
of
akbar
reign
he
was
for
a
long
time
akbar
prime
minister
he
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
religious
discussions
inaugurated
by
the
emperor
and
often
discomfited
the
orthodox
followers
of
islam
with
his
arguments
sheikh
mubarak
drew
up
the
famous
document
declaring
akbar
to
be
the
head
of
the
church
and
both
his
sons
subscribed
to
it
abul
fazl
declares
that
the
document
was
productive
of
excellent
results
the
court
became
the
resort
of
the
learned
men
and
sages
of
all
creeds
and
nationalities
peace
was
given
to
all
and
perfect
tolerance
prevailed
the
disinterested
motives
of
the
emperor
whose
labours
were
directed
to
a
search
after
truth
were
rendered
clear
and
the
pretenders
to
learning
and
scholarship
were
put
to
shame
notwithstanding
his
high
character
and
generous
disposition
abul
fazl
had
many
enemies
at
court
he
was
at
last
assassinated
at
the
instigation
of
jahangir
who
believed
him
to
be
responsible
for
a
misunderstanding
between
himself
and
his
father
there
is
nothing
architecturally
interesting
about
the
two
houses
which
have
been
for
some
time
used
as
a
zillah
school
bharatpur
and
other
places
in
the
vicinity
of
agra
there
are
some
other
places
of
considerable
interest
easily
accessible
from
agra
but
it
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
to
describe
them
in
detail
this
place
which
has
been
often
alluded
to
is
the
capital
of
a
native
state
of
that
name
founded
by
the
jâts
under
suraj
mal
about
the
origin
of
the
jât
race
is
obscure
but
probably
they
are
of
scythian
descent
some
authorities
have
put
forward
a
theory
that
the
gypsies
of
europe
and
the
jâts
are
of
the
same
race
they
form
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
of
india
their
religion
varies
with
the
locality
but
the
jâts
who
occupied
agra
under
suraj
mal
were
hindus
in
the
fort
at
bharatpur
resisted
for
six
weeks
a
siege
by
general
afterwards
lord
lake
who
withdrew
after
four
desperate
assaults
the
palace
of
suraj
mal
is
at
dig
miles
by
road
from
bharatpur
it
was
commenced
about
and
is
the
finest
and
most
original
of
the
indian
palaces
of
that
period
the
jât
chief
carried
off
to
it
a
great
deal
of
the
loot
from
the
agra
fort
the
tombs
of
suraj
mal
and
his
two
ranis
are
at
govardhan
a
very
picturesque
place
about
eight
miles
from
dig
there
are
also
a
number
of
very
interesting
tombs
and
buildings
of
later
date
fergusson
says
of
one
of
these
which
was
in
course
of
construction
when
he
was
there
in
that
he
acquired
from
its
native
architect
more
knowledge
of
the
secrets
of
art
as
practised
in
the
middle
ages
than
he
had
learnt
from
all
the
books
he
had
read
the
same
living
architectural
art
is
practised
all
over
rajputana
at
the
present
day
the
preference
we
show
for
the
incomparably
inferior
art
of
the
mongrel
eclectic
styles
we
have
imported
into
india
is
only
a
proof
that
there
is
something
wanting
in
the
superior
civilization
and
culture
which
we
believe
ourselves
to
possess
there

now
bernier
does
not
say
that
the
statues
were
put
up
by
akbar
but
general
cunningham
inferring
that
bernier
meant
this
propounded
a
theory
that
they
were
originally
in
front
of
the
agra
fort
which
akbar
built
and
removed
to
delhi
by
shah
jahan
when
he
built
his
new
palace
there
keene
who
discusses
the
question
at
length
in
his
handbook
to
delhi
accepts
this
suggestion
neither
of
these
authorities
seem
to
have
been
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
marks
of
the
feet
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
agra
hathi
pol
i
have
compared
the
measurements
of
these
marks
with
the
dimensions
of
the
elephant
which
still
exists
at
delhi
and
find
that
they
do
not
correspond
in
any
way
the
delhi
elephant
is
a
much
larger
animal
and
would
not
fit
into
the
platform
at
the
agra
gate
general
cunningham
theory
therefore
falls
to
the
ground
it
is
just
possible
that
the
delhi
elephants
were
intended
to
be
copies
of
those
placed
by
akbar
at
agra
shah
jahan
is
not
likely
to
have
intentionally
perpetuated
the
memory
of
the
rajput
chiefs
but
popular
tradition
or
imagination
may
have
fastened
the
story
told
by
bernier
on
to
the
delhi
statues
elephants
were
so
commonly
placed
in
front
of
indian
palaces
and
fortresses
that
except
for
this
story
there
would
be
no
need
to
suppose
any
connection
between
those
at
agra
and
those
at
delhi
purchas
quoting
william
finch
who
visited
agra
in
jahangir
time
describes
the
elephants
at
the
hathi
pol
but
gives
a
different
origin
to
the
statues
beyond
these
two
gates
you
pass
a
second
gate
over
which
are
two
rajaws
in
stone
it
is
said
that
they
were
two
brother
rajputs
tutors
to
a
prince
their
nephew
whom
the
king
demanded
of
them
they
refused
and
were
committed
but
drew
on
the
officers
slew
twelve
and
at
last
by
multitudes
oppressing
were
themselves
slain
and
here
have
elephants
of
stone
and
themselves
figured
the
expression
over
the
gate
has
the
meaning
of
high
up
and
not
as
keene
supposes
its
more
modern
sense
of
on
the
top
of
the
old
mogul
road
led
directly
from
the
elephant
gate
to
the
entrance
of
the
i
understand
that
this
road
will
be
restored
shortly
by
the
archæological
department
an
ugly
modern
marble
rail
in
imitation
of
wood
probably
a
reminiscence
of
the
time
when
the
palace
was
occupied
by
the
british
garrison
still
disfigures
and
stunts
the
proportions
of
the
upper
storey
of
the
samman
burj
this
question
is
discussed
at
length
in
an
article
by
the
author
entitled
the
taj
and
its
designers
published
in
the
june
number
of
the
century
and
tavernier
says
years
probably
including
all
the
accessory
buildings
the
present
garden
is
a
jungle
planted
by
a
european
overseer
without
any
understanding
or
feeling
for
the
ideas
of
the
mogul
artists
the
overgrown
trees
entirely
block
out
the
view
of
the
mosques
on
either
side
which
are
an
essential
part
of
the
whole
composition
serving
as
supporters
to
the
slender
detached
minarets
i
understand
however
that
it
is
intended
to
remove
some
of
the
more
obstructive
of
the
larger
trees
but
the
avenue
of
cypress
trees
which
perished
from
drought
some
years
ago
has
been
replanted
on
lines
which
eventually
will
clash
seriously
with
the
architectural
composition
this
represents
the
condition
of
the
garden
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
the
conjunction
of
jupiter
and
venus
referring
to
the
circumstance
that
timur
and
himself
were
born
at
the
conjunction
of
these
planets
keene
it
is
very
probable
that
the
black
slate
or
marble
panels
in
the
delhi
palace
which
are
purely
florentine
in
design
were
imported
complete
from
italy
and
fixed
in
the
wall
by
indian
workmen
who
only
designed
the
ornamental
scrolls
surrounding
the
panels
it
is
known
that
in
akbar
completed
a
great
building
at
fatehpur
called
the
ibadat
khana
or
hall
in
which
the
learned
men
of
all
religions
assembled
for
discussion
it
was
described
as
containing
four
halls
the
western
for
the
sayyids
or
descendants
of
the
prophet
the
southern
for
learned
men
who
had
studied
or
acquired
knowledge
the
northern
for
those
famed
for
inspired
wisdom
the
eastern
hall
was
reserved
for
the
nobles
and
state
officers
thousands
of
people
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
assembled
in
the
courtyard
the
emperor
attended
every
friday
night
and
on
holy
festivals
moving
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
guests
and
conversing
with
them
keene
in
his
handbook
to
agra
suggests
that
possibly
the
may
be
the
building
thus
described
taking
the
word
or
hall
to
mean
a
side
gallery
as
no
other
building
at
all
answering
to
the
description
now
remains
at
fatehpur
this
supposition
is
highly
improbable
if
only
for
the
reason
given
by
edmund
smith
namely
that
an
assembly
of
this
kind
would
not
take
place
within
the
precincts
of
the
palace
the
description
given
by
abul
fazl
and
badâyûni
clearly
indicates
a
building
like
the
enclosing
a
great
quadrangle
keene
suggests
that
akbar
first
wife
and
cousin
sultana
raqia
begam
lived
here
but
she
was
a
muhammadan
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
name
of
jodh
bai
princess
of
jodhpur
really
refers
to
mariam
and
not
to
jahangir
rajput
wife
the
daughter
of
the
raja
of
jodhpur
as
is
commonly
supposed
miriam
family
resided
in
the
province
of
ajmir
which
adjoins
jodhpur
she
might
have
been
known
as
the
princess
of
jodhpur
in
any
case
it
is
easy
to
see
how
a
confusion
might
have
arisen
between
jahangir
mother
and
his
wife
both
hindus
and
rajputs
birbal
house
is
now
used
as
a
travellers
for
high
officials
and
distinguished
visitors
which
is
not
only
very
inconvenient
for
the
undistinguished
who
may
wish
to
see
it
but
involves
alterations
which
should
never
be
permitted
in
buildings
of
such
unique
artistic
and
archæological
interest
neither
the
daftar
khana
nor
this
building
should
be
devoted
to
such
purposes
merely
to
avoid
the
paltry
expense
of
providing
proper
dak
bungalows
