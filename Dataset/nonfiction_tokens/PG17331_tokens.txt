chapter
i

under

dominion
on
the
nile
settlement
of
the
egyptian
frontiers
religious
developments
augustus
began
his
reign
in
egypt
in
by
ordering
all
the
statues
of
antony
of
which
there
were
more
than
fifty
ornamenting
the
various
public
buildings
of
the
city
to
be
broken
to
pieces
and
it
is
said
he
had
the
meanness
to
receive
a
bribe
of
one
thousand
talents
from
archibus
a
friend
of
cleopatra
that
the
statues
might
be
left
standing
it
seems
to
have
been
part
of
his
kingcraft
to
give
the
offices
of
greatest
trust
to
men
of
low
birth
who
were
at
the
same
time
well
aware
that
they
owed
their
employments
to
their
seeming
want
of
ambition
thus
the
government
of
egypt
the
greatest
and
richest
of
the
provinces
was
given
to
cornelius
gallus
before
the
fall
of
the
republic
the
senate
had
given
the
command
of
the
provinces
to
members
of
their
own
body
only
and
therefore
augustus
not
wishing
to
alter
the
law
obtained
from
the
senate
for
himself
all
those
governments
which
he
meant
to
give
to
men
of
lower
rank
by
this
legal
fiction
these
equestrian
prefects
were
answerable
for
their
conduct
to
nobody
but
the
emperor
on
a
petition
and
they
could
not
be
sued
at
law
before
the
senate
for
their
misdeeds
but
he
made
an
exception
in
the
case
of
egypt
while
on
the
one
hand
in
that
province
he
gave
to
the
edicts
the
force
of
law
on
the
other
he
allowed
him
to
be
cited
before
the
senate
though
appointed
by
himself
the
power
thus
given
to
the
senate
they
never
ventured
to
use
and
the
prefect
of
egypt
was
never
punished
or
removed
but
by
the
emperor
under
the
prefect
was
the
chief
justice
of
the
province
who
heard
himself
or
by
deputy
all
causes
except
those
which
were
reserved
for
the
decision
of
the
emperor
in
person
these
last
were
decided
by
a
second
judge
or
in
modern
language
a
chancellor
as
they
were
too
numerous
and
too
trifling
to
be
taken
to
rome
under
these
judges
were
numerous
freedmen
of
the
emperor
and
clerks
entrusted
with
affairs
of
greater
and
less
weight
of
the
native
magistrates
the
chief
were
the
keeper
of
the
records
the
police
judge
the
prefect
of
the
night
and
the
or
interpreter
of
the
egyptian
law
who
was
allowed
to
wear
a
purple
robe
like
a
roman
magistrate
but
these
egyptian
magistrates
were
never
treated
as
citizens
they
were
barbarians
little
better
than
slaves
and
only
raised
to
the
rank
of
the
freedmen
augustus
showed
not
a
little
jealousy
in
the
rest
of
the
laws
by
which
his
new
province
was
to
be
governed
while
other
conquered
cities
usually
had
a
senate
or
municipal
form
of
government
granted
to
them
no
city
in
egypt
was
allowed
that
privilege
which
by
teaching
the
citizens
the
art
of
governing
themselves
and
the
advantages
of
union
might
have
made
them
less
at
the
mercy
of
their
masters
he
not
only
gave
the
command
of
the
kingdom
to
a
man
below
the
rank
of
a
senator
but
ordered
that
no
senator
should
even
be
allowed
to
set
foot
in
egypt
without
leave
from
himself
and
centuries
later
when
the
weakness
of
the
country
had
led
the
emperors
to
soften
some
of
the
other
stern
laws
of
augustus
this
was
still
strictly
enforced
among
other
changes
then
brought
in
by
the
romans
was
the
use
of
a
fixed
year
in
all
civil
reckonings
the
egyptians
for
all
the
common
purposes
of
life
called
the
day
of
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
dogstar
about
our
of
july
their
new
day
and
the
husbandman
marked
it
with
religious
ceremonies
as
the
time
when
the
nile
began
to
overflow
while
for
all
civil
purposes
and
dates
of
reigns
they
used
a
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
which
of
course
had
a
movable
new
day
but
by
the
orders
of
augustus
all
public
deeds
were
henceforth
dated
by
the
new
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
and
a
quarter
which
was
named
after
julius
cæsar
the
julian
year
the
years
from
were
made
to
begin
on
the
of
august
the
day
on
which
the
movable
new
day
then
happened
to
fall
and
were
numbered
from
the
year
following
the
last
of
cleopatra
as
from
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
augustus
but
notwithstanding
the
many
advantages
of
the
julian
year
which
was
used
throughout
europe
for
sixteen
centuries
till
its
faultiness
was
pointed
out
by
pope
gregory
the
egyptian
astronomers
and
mathematicians
distrusted
it
from
the
first
and
chose
to
stick
to
their
old
year
in
which
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
its
length
thus
there
were
at
the
same
time
three
years
and
three
new
days
in
use
in
egypt
one
about
the
of
july
used
by
the
common
people
one
on
the
of
august
used
by
order
of
the
emperor
and
one
movable
used
by
the
astronomers
by
the
conquest
of
egypt
augustus
was
also
able
to
extend
another
of
the
plans
of
his
late
uncle
julius
cæsar
whose
powerful
mind
found
all
sciences
within
its
grasp
had
ordered
a
survey
to
be
taken
of
the
whole
of
the
roman
provinces
and
the
length
of
all
the
roads
to
be
measured
for
the
use
of
the
and
of
the
army
and
augustus
was
now
able
to
add
egypt
to
the
survey
polyclitus
was
employed
on
this
southern
portion
of
the
empire
and
after
years
from
its
beginning
by
julius
the
measurement
of
nearly
the
whole
known
world
was
finished
and
reported
to
the
senate
at
alexandria
augustus
was
visited
by
herod
who
hastened
to
beg
of
him
those
portions
of
his
kingdom
which
antony
had
given
to
cleopatra
augustus
received
him
as
a
friend
gave
him
back
the
territory
which
antony
had
taken
from
him
and
added
the
province
of
samaria
and
the
free
cities
on
the
coast
he
also
gave
to
him
the
body
of
four
hundred
gauls
who
formed
part
of
the
egyptian
army
and
had
been
bodyguard
he
thus
removed
from
alexandria
the
last
remains
of
the
gallic
mercenaries
of
whom
the
ptolemies
had
usually
had
a
troop
in
their
service
illustration
plan
of
alexandria
augustus
visited
the
royal
to
see
the
body
of
alexander
and
devoutly
added
a
golden
crown
and
a
garland
of
flowers
to
the
other
ornaments
on
the
sarcophagus
of
the
macedonian
but
he
would
take
no
pains
to
please
either
the
alexandrians
or
egyptians
he
despised
them
both
when
asked
if
he
would
not
like
to
see
the
alexandrian
monarchs
lying
in
their
in
the
same
tomb
he
answered
i
came
to
see
the
king
not
dead
men
his
contempt
for
cleopatra
and
her
father
made
him
forget
the
great
qualities
of
ptolemy
soter
so
when
he
was
at
memphis
he
refused
to
humour
the
national
prejudice
of
two
thousand
standing
by
visiting
the
bull
apis
of
the
former
conquerors
cambyses
had
stabbed
the
sacred
bull
alexander
had
sacrificed
to
it
had
augustus
had
the
violent
temper
of
either
he
would
have
copied
cambyses
the
egyptians
always
found
the
treatment
of
the
sacred
bull
a
foretaste
of
what
they
were
themselves
to
receive
from
their
sovereigns
the
greeks
of
alexandria
who
had
for
some
time
past
very
unwillingly
yielded
to
the
jews
the
right
of
citizenship
now
urged
upon
augustus
that
it
should
no
longer
be
granted
augustus
however
had
received
great
services
from
the
jews
and
at
once
refused
the
prayer
and
he
set
up
in
alexandria
an
inscription
granting
to
the
jews
the
full
privileges
of
macedonians
which
they
claimed
and
had
hitherto
enjoyed
under
the
ptolemies
they
were
allowed
their
own
magistrates
and
courts
of
justice
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
own
religion
and
soon
afterwards
when
their
high
priest
died
they
were
allowed
as
usual
to
choose
his
successor
the
greek
jews
of
alexandria
were
indeed
very
important
both
from
their
numbers
and
their
learning
they
spread
over
syria
and
asia
minor
they
had
a
synagogue
in
jerusalem
in
common
with
the
jews
of
cyrene
and
libya
and
we
find
that
one
of
the
chief
teachers
of
christianity
after
the
apostles
was
apollos
the
alexandrian
who
preached
the
new
religion
in
ephesus
in
corinth
and
in
crete
on
his
return
to
rome
augustus
carried
with
him
the
whole
of
the
royal
treasure
and
though
perhaps
there
might
have
been
less
gold
and
silver
than
usual
in
the
palace
of
the
ptolemies
still
it
was
so
large
a
sum
that
when
upon
the
establishment
of
peace
over
all
the
world
the
rate
of
interest
upon
loans
fell
in
rome
and
the
price
of
land
rose
the
change
was
thought
to
have
been
caused
by
the
money
from
alexandria
at
the
same
time
were
carried
away
the
valuable
jewels
furniture
and
ornaments
which
had
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
with
the
crown
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
these
were
drawn
in
waggons
through
the
streets
of
rome
in
triumph
and
with
them
were
shown
in
chains
to
the
wondering
crowd
alexander
helius
and
cleopatra
selene
the
children
of
cleopatra
and
antony
augustus
threatened
a
severe
punishment
to
the
alexandrians
in
the
building
of
a
new
capital
only
four
miles
from
the
canopic
or
eastern
gate
of
alexandria
he
laid
out
the
plan
of
his
new
city
of
meopolis
on
the
spot
where
he
had
routed
mark
forces
here
he
began
several
large
temples
and
removed
to
them
the
public
sacrifices
and
the
priesthood
from
the
temples
of
alexandria
but
the
work
was
carried
no
farther
and
soon
abandoned
and
the
only
change
made
by
it
in
alexandria
was
that
the
temple
of
serapis
and
the
other
temples
were
for
a
time
deserted
the
rest
of
the
world
had
long
been
used
to
see
their
finest
works
of
art
carried
away
by
their
conquerors
and
the
egyptians
soon
learned
that
if
any
of
the
monuments
of
which
they
were
so
justly
proud
were
to
be
left
to
them
it
would
only
be
because
they
were
too
heavy
to
be
moved
by
the
roman
engineers
beside
many
other
smaller
egyptian
works
two
of
the
large
obelisks
which
even
now
ornament
rome
were
carried
away
by
augustus
that
of
thutmosis
which
stands
in
the
piazza
del
popolo
and
that
of
psammetichus
on
monte
citorio
cornelius
gallus
the
prefect
of
egypt
seems
either
to
have
misunderstood
or
soon
forgotten
the
terms
of
his
appointment
he
set
up
statues
of
himself
in
the
cities
of
egypt
and
copying
the
kings
of
the
country
he
carved
his
name
and
deeds
upon
the
pyramids
on
this
augustus
recalled
him
and
he
killed
himself
to
avoid
punishment
the
wish
to
check
the
tyranny
of
the
prefects
and
was
strongly
marked
in
the
case
of
the
champion
the
alexandrians
bred
these
birds
with
great
care
and
eagerly
watched
their
battles
in
the
theatre
a
powerful
cock
that
had
hitherto
slain
all
its
rivals
and
always
strutted
over
the
table
unconquered
had
gained
a
great
name
in
the
city
and
this
bird
eros
a
roasted
and
ate
augustus
on
hearing
of
this
insult
to
the
people
sent
for
the
man
and
on
his
owning
what
he
had
done
ordered
him
to
be
crucified
three
legions
and
nine
cohorts
were
found
force
enough
to
keep
this
great
kingdom
in
quiet
obedience
to
their
new
masters
and
when
heroopolis
revolted
and
afterwards
when
a
rebellion
broke
out
in
the
thebaid
against
the
roman
these
risings
were
easily
crushed
the
spirit
of
the
nation
both
of
the
greeks
and
egyptians
seems
to
have
been
wholly
broken
and
petronius
who
succeeded
cornelius
gallus
found
no
difficulty
in
putting
down
a
rising
of
the
alexandrians
the
canals
through
which
the
overflowing
waters
of
the
nile
were
carried
to
the
more
distant
fields
were
of
course
each
year
more
or
less
blocked
up
by
the
same
mud
which
made
the
fields
fruitful
and
the
clearing
of
these
canals
was
one
of
the
greatest
boons
that
the
monarch
could
bestow
upon
the
tillers
of
the
soil
this
had
often
been
neglected
by
the
less
powerful
and
less
prudent
kings
of
egypt
in
whose
reigns
the
husbandman
believed
that
heaven
in
its
displeasure
withheld
part
of
the
overflow
but
petronius
employed
the
leisure
of
his
soldiers
on
this
wise
and
benevolent
work
in
order
better
to
understand
the
rise
of
the
nile
to
fix
the
amount
of
the
and
more
fairly
to
regulate
the
overflow
through
the
canals
the
nilometer
on
the
island
of
elephantine
was
at
this
time
made
illustration
the
nilometer
at
elephantine
it
was
under
ælius
gallus
the
third
prefect
that
egypt
was
visited
by
strabo
the
most
careful
and
judicious
of
all
the
ancient
travellers
he
had
come
to
study
mathematics
astronomy
and
geography
in
the
museum
under
the
successors
of
euclid
eratosthenes
and
hipparchus
he
accompanied
the
prefect
in
a
march
to
syênê
aswan
the
border
town
and
he
has
left
us
a
valuable
account
of
the
state
of
the
country
at
that
time
alexandria
was
the
chief
object
that
engaged
his
attention
its
two
harbours
held
more
ships
than
were
to
be
seen
in
any
other
port
in
the
world
and
its
export
trade
was
thought

the
ship
canal
from

full
of
bustle
and
activity
the
palace
or
citadel
on
the
promontory
of
lochias
on

side
of

as
striking
an
object
as

a
space
of

equal
to
more
than
part
of

reached
even
beyond
the

among
the

were
the

held
the

of

of

the

point
of

which
jutted
into
the

the
cæsarium
or
new
palace
and
the
great
temple
of
serapis
which
was
on
the
western
side
of
the
city
and
was
the
largest
and
most
ornamented
of
all
these
buildings
farther
off
was
the
beautiful
gymnasium
for
wrestlers
and
boxers
with
its
porticoes
of
a
stadium
in
length
where
the
citizens
used
to
meet
in
public
assembly
from
the
top
of
the
temple
of
pan
which
rose
like
a
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
was
mounted
by
a
winding
staircase
the
whole
of
this
remarkable
capital
might
be
seen
spread
out
before
the
eye
on
the
east
of
the
city
was
the
circus
for
chariot
races
and
on
the
west
lay
the
public
gardens
and
pale
green
and
the
necropolis
ornamenting
the
roadside
with
tombs
for
miles
along

seashore
other
tombs
were
in
the
catacombs
underground
on
the
same
side
of
the
city
the
banks
of
the
mareotic
lake
were
fringed
with
vineyards
which
bore
the
famed
wine
of
the
same
name
and
which
formed
a
pleasant
contrast
with
the
burning
whiteness
of
the
desert
beyond
the
canal
from
the
lake
to
the
nile
marked
its
course
through
the
plain
by
the
greater
freshness
of
the
green
along
its
banks
in
the
distance
were
the
new
buildings
of
city
of
nicopolis
the
arts
of
greece
and
the
wealth
of
egypt
had
united
to
adorn
the
capital
of
the
ptolemies
heliopolis
the
ancient
seat
of
egyptian
learning
had
never
been
wholly
repaired
since
its
siege
by
cambyses
and
was
then
almost
a
deserted
city
its
schools
were
empty
its
teachers
silent
but
the
houses
in
which
plato
and
his
friend
eudoxus
were
said
to
have
dwelt
and
studied
were
pointed
out
to
the
traveller
to
warm
his
love
of
knowledge
and
encourage
him
in
the
pursuit
of
virtue
memphis
was
the
second
city
in
egypt
while
thebes
and
abydos
the
former
capitals
had
fallen
to
the
size
and
rank
of
villages
at

and
was
allowed
to
look
at
the
bull
apis
through
a
window
of
his

at

he
saw
the
sacred
crocodile
caught
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
and
fed
with
cakes
and
wine
ptolemais
which
was
at
first
only
an
encampment
of
greek
soldiers
had
risen
under
the
sovereigns
to
whom
it
owed
its
name
to
be
the
largest
city
in
the
thebaid
and
scarcely
less
than
memphis
it
was
built
wholly
by
the
greeks
and
like
alexandria
it
was
under
greek
laws
while
the
other
cities
in
egypt
were
under
egyptian
laws
and
magistrates
it
was
situated
between
panopolis
and
abydos
but
while
the
temples
of
thebes
which
were
built
so
many
centuries
earlier
are
still
standing
in
awful
grandeur
scarcely
a
trace
of
this
greek
city
can
be
found
in
the
villages
of
el
menshieh
and
girgeh
cerkasoros
which
now
stand
on
the
spot
strabo
and
the
roman
generals
did
not
forget
to
visit
the
broken
colossal
statue
of
amenhôthes
near
thebes
which
sent
forth
its
musical
sounds
every
morning
as
the
sun
rising
over
the
arabian
hills
first
shone
upon
its
face
but
this
inquiring
traveller
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
the
music
came
from
the
statue
or
the
base
or
the
people
around
it
he
ended
his
tour
with
watching
the
sunshine
at
the
bottom
of
the
astronomical
well
at
syênê
which
on
the
longest
day
is
exactly
under
the
northern
edge
and
with
admiring
the
skill
of
the
boatmen
who
shot
down
the
cataracts
in
their
wicker
boats
for
the
amusement
of
the
roman
generals
in
the
earlier
periods
of
egyptian
history
ethiopia
was
peopled
or
at
least
governed
by
a
race
of
men
whom
as
they
spoke
the
same
language
and
worshipped
the
same
gods
as
their
neighbours
of
upper
egypt
we
must
call
the
kopts
but
the
arabs
under
the
name
of
troglodyte
and
other
tribes
had
made
an
early
settlement
on
the
african
side
of
the
red
sea
so
numerous
were
they
in
upper
egypt
that
in
the
time
of
strabo
half
the
population
of
the
city
of
koptos
were
arabs
they
were
the
and
carriers
for
the
theban
merchants
in
the
trade
across
the
desert
some
of
the
conquests
of
ramses
had
been
over
that
nation
in
southern
ethiopia
and
the
arab
power
must
have
further
risen
after
the
defeat
of
the
ethiopians
by
euergetes
ethiopia
in
the
time
of
augustus
was
held
by
arabs
a
race
who
thought
peace
a
state
of
disgraceful
idleness
and
war
the
only
employment
worthy
of
men
and
who
made
frequent
hasty
inroads
into
nubia
and
sometimes
into
egypt
they
fought
for
plunder
not
for
conquest
and
usually
retreated
as
quickly
as
they
came
with
such
booty
as
they
laid
their
hands
on
to
use
words
which
were
proverbial
while
the
nile
swarmed
with
crocodiles
did
as
the
dogs
do
they
drank
and
ran
away
and
the
romans
found
it
necessary
to
place
a
body
of
troops
near
the
cataracts
of
syênê
to
stop
their
marching
northward
and
laying
waste
the
thebaid
while
the
larger
part
of
the
roman
legions
was
withdrawn
into
arabia
on
an
unsuccessful
quest
for
treasure
a
body
of
thirty
thousand
of
these
men
whom
we
may
call
either
arabs
from
their
blood
and
language
or
ethiopians
from
their
country
marched
northward
into
egypt
and
overpowered
the
three
roman
cohorts
at
elephantine
syênê
and
philas
badly
armed
and
badly
trained
they
were
led
on
by
the
generals
of
candace
queen
of
napata
to
the
fourth
cataract
they
were
however
easily
driven
back
when
gallus
led
against
them
an
army
of
ten
thousand
men
and
drove
them
to
ethiopian
pselchis
now
remaining
as
the
modern
village
of
dakkeh
there
he
defeated
them
again
and
took
the
city
by
storm
from
pselchis
he
marched
across
the
nubian
desert
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
premnis
on
the
northerly
bend
of
the
river
and
then
made
himself
master
of
napata
the
capital
a
guard
was
at
the
moment
left
in
the
country
to
check
any
future
inroads
but
the
romans
made
no
attempts
to
hold
it
illustration
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
of
the
state
of
the
ethiopie
arabs
under
queen
candace
we
learn
but
little
from
this
hasty
inroad
but
some
of
the
tribes
must
have
been
very
far
from
the
barbarians
that
from
their
ignorance
of
the
arts
of
war
the
romans
judged
them
to
be
those
nearest
to
the
egyptian
frontiers
the
troglodyte
and
blemmyes
were
unsettled
wandering
and
plundering
but
the
inhabitants
of
meroë
were
of
a
more
civilised
race
the
jews
had
settled
in
southern
ethiopia
in
large
numbers
and
for
a
long
time
trade
had
made
them
acquainted
with
adule
and
auxum
some
of
them
were
employed
in
the
highest
offices
and
must
have
brought
with
them
the
arts
of
civilised
life
a
few
years
later
acts
viii
we
meet
with
a
jewish
eunuch
the
treasurer
of
queen
candace
travelling
with
some
pomp
from
ethiopia
to
the
religious
festivals
at
jerusalem
the
egyptian
coins
of
augustus
and
his
successors
are
all
greek
the
conquest
of
the
country
by
the
romans
made
no
change
in
its
language
though
the
chief
part
of
the
population
spoke
koptic
it
was
still
a
greek
province
of
the
roman
empire
the
decrees
of
the
prefects
of
alexandria
and
of
the
upper
provinces
were
written
in
greek
and
every
roman
traveller
who
like
a
schoolboy
has
scratched
his
name
upon
the
foot
of
the
musical
statue
of
amenhôthes
to
let
the
world
know
the
extent
of
his
travels
has
helped
to
prove
that
the
roman
government
of
the
country
was
carried
on
in
the
greek
language
the
coins
often
bear
the
eagle
and
thunderbolt
on
one
side
while
on
the
other
is
the
head
with
his
name
and
titles
and
after
a
few
years
they
are
all
dated
with
the
year
of
the
reign
in
the
earliest
he
is
styled
a
son
of
god
in
imitation
of
the
egyptian
title
of
son
of
the
sun
after
egypt
lost
its
liberty
we
no
longer
find
any
gold
coinage
in
the
country
that
metal
with
everything
else
that
was
most
costly
was
carried
away
to
pay
the
roman
tribute
this
was
chiefly
taken
in
money
except
indeed
the
tax
on
grain
which
the
egyptian
kings
had
always
received
in
kind
and
which
was
still
gathered
in
the
same
way
and
each
year
shipped
to
rome
to
be
distributed
among
the
idle
poor
of
that
great
city
at
this
time
it
amounted
to
twenty
millions
of
bushels
which
was
four
times
what
was
levied
in
the
reign
of
philadelphus
the
trade
to
the
east
was
increasing
but
as
yet
not
large
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
small
vessels
sailed
every
year
to
india
from
myoshormos
which
was
now
the
chief
port
on
the
red
sea
no
change
was
made
in
the
egyptian
religion
by
this
change
of
masters
and
though
the
means
of
the
priests
were
lessened
they
still
carried
forward
the
buildings
which
were
in
progress
and
even
began
new
ones
the
small
temple
of
isis
at
tentyra
behind
the
great
temple
of
hâthor
was
either
built
or
finished
in
this
reign
and
it
was
dedicated
to
the
goddess
and
to
the
honour
of
the
emperor
as
jupiter
liberator
in
a
greek
inscription
on
the
cornice
in
the
year
of
the
reign
when
publius
octavius
was
prefect
of
the
province
illustration
a
koptic
maiden
the
large
temple
at
talmis
in
nubia
was
also
then
built
though
not
wholly
finished
and
we
find
the
name
of
augustus
at
philæ
on
some
of
the
additions
to
the
temple
of
isis
which
had
been
built
in
the
reign
of
philadelphus
in
the
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
on
these
temples
augustus
is
called
autocrator
cæsar
and
is
styled
son
of
the
sun
king
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
with
the
other
titles
which
had
always
been
given
by
the
priests
to
the
ptolemies
and
their
own
native
sovereigns
for
so
many
centuries
these
claims
were
evidently
unknown
in
rome
where
the
modesty
of
augustus
was
almost
proverbial
the
greeks
had
at
all
times
been
forward
in
owning
the
egyptians
as
their
teachers
in
religion
and
in
the
dog
cerberus
the
judge
minos
the
boat
of
charon
and
the
river
styx
of
their
mythology
we
see
a
clear
proof
that
it
was
in
egypt
that
the
greeks
gained
their
faint
glimpse
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
day
of
judgment
and
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
and
now
that
rome
was
in
close
intercourse
with
egypt
the
romans
were
equally
ready
to
borrow
thence
their
religious
ceremonies
they
brought
to
rome
the
egyptian
opinions
with
the
statues
of
the
gods
they
ran
into
the
new
superstition
to
avoid
the
painful
uneasiness
of
believing
nothing
and
though
the
romans
ridiculed
their
own
gods
they
believed
in
those
of
egypt
so
fashionable
was
the
worship
of
isis
and
serapis
becoming
in
italy
that
augustus
made
a
law
that
no
egyptian
ceremonies
should
enter
the
city
or
even
the
suburbs
of
rome
his
subjects
might
copy
the
luxuries
the
follies
and
the
vices
of
the
alexandrians
but
not
the
gloomy
devotion
of
the
egyptians
but
the
spread
of
opinions
was
not
so
checked
even
virgil
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
egyptian
millennium
or
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
when
the
thousand
years
were
ended
and
the
cripple
asking
for
alms
in
the
streets
of
rome
would
beg
in
the
name
of
the
holy
osiris
egypt
felt
no
change
on
the
death
of
augustus
the
province
was
well
governed
during
the
whole
of
the
reign
of
tiberius
and
the
alexandrians
completed
the
beautiful
temple
to
his
honour
named
the
sebaste
or
temple
it
stood
by
the
side
of
the
harbour
and
was
surrounded
with
a
sacred
grove
it
was
ornamented
with
porticoes
and
fitted
up
with
libraries
paintings
and
statues
and
was
the
most
lofty
building
in
the
city
in
front
of
this
temple
they
set
up
two
ancient
obelisks
which
had
been
made
by
thutmosis
iii
and
carved
by
ramses
and
which
like
the
other
monuments
of
the
theban
kings
have
outlived
all
the
temples
and
palaces
of
their
greek
and
roman
successors
these
obelisks
are
now
generally
known
as
one
of
them
in
was
taken
to
london
and
set
up
on
the
thames
embankment
the
other
was
soon
afterward
brought
to
new
york
and
is
now
in
central
park
in
that
city
it
is
feet
high
to
its
sharpened
apex
and
seven
feet
seven
inches
in
diameter
at
its
base
on
its
face
are
deeply
incised
inscriptions
in
hieroglyphic
character
giving
the
names
thutmosis
ramses
and
seti
ii
illustration
fragments
in
wood
painted
the
harsh
justice
with
which
tiberius
began
his
reign
was
at
rome
soon
changed
into
a
cruel
tyranny
but
in
the
provinces
it
was
only
felt
as
a
check
to
the
injustice
of
the
prefects
on
one
occasion
when
æmilius
rectus
sent
home
from
egypt
a
larger
amount
of
taxes
than
was
usual
he
hoped
that
his
zeal
would
be
praised
by
tiberius
but
the
message
to
the
prefect
was
as
stern
as
it
was
humane
should
wish
my
sheep
to
be
sheared
but
not
to
be
on
the
death
of
one
of
the
prefects
there
was
found
among
his
property
at
rome
a
statue
of
menelaus
carved
in
ethiopian
obsidian
which
had
been
used
in
the
religious
ceremonies
in
the
temple
of
heliopolis
and
tiberius
returned
it
to
the
priests
of
that
city
as
its
rightful
owners
another
proof
of
the
equal
justice
with
which
this
province
was
governed
was
to
be
seen
in
the
buildings
then
carried
on
by
the
priests
in
upper
egypt
we
find
the
name
of
tiberius
carved
in
hieroglyphics
on
additions
or
repairs
made
to
the
temples
at
thebes
at
aphroditopolis
at
berenicê
on
the
red
sea
at
philæ
and
at
the
greek
city
of
parembole
in
nubia
the
great
portico
was
at
this
time
added
to
the
temple
at
tentyra
with
an
inscription
dedicating
it
to
the
goddess
in
greek
and
in
hieroglyphics
as
a
building
is
often
the
work
of
years
while
sculpture
is
only
the
work
of
weeks
so
the
fashion
of
the
former
is
always
far
less
changing
than
that
of
the
latter
the
sculptures
on
the
walls
of
this
beautiful
portico
are
crowded
and
graceless
while
on
the
other
hand
the
building
itself
has
the
same
grand
simplicity
and
massive
strength
that
we
find
in
the
older
temples
of
upper
egypt
we
can
not
but
admire
the
zeal
of
the
egyptians
by
whom
this
work
was
then
finished
they
were
treated
as
slaves
by
their
greek
their
houses
were
ransacked
every
third
year
by
military
authority
in
search
of
arms
they
could
have
had
no
help
from
their
roman
masters
who
only
drained
the
province
of
its
wealth
and
the
temple
had
perhaps
never
been
heard
of
by
the
emperor
who
could
have
been
little
aware
that
the
most
lasting
monument
of
his
reign
was
being
raised
in
the
distant
province

the
priests

sent
gifts
out
of
their
poverty
in
aid
of
this
pious
work
and
among
the
figures
on
the
walls
we
see
those
of
forty
cities
from
semneh
at
the
second

the
delta
each
presenting
an
offering

the
god

the
third
year
of
this
reign
germanicus
cæsar
who
much
against
his
will
had
been
sent
into
the
east
as
governor
found
time
to
leave
his
own
province
and
to
snatch
a
hasty
view
of
the
buildings
of
egypt
descending
the
river
to
thebes
and
while
gazing
on
the
huge
remains
of
the
temples
he
asked
the
priests
to
read
to
him
the
hieroglyphical
writing
on
the
walls
he
was
told
that
it
recounted
the
greatness
of
the
country
in
the
time
of
king
ramses
when
there
were
seven
hundred
thousand
egyptians
of
an
age
to
bear
arms
and
that
with
these
troops
ramses
had
conquered
the
libyans
ethiopians
medes
persians
bactrians
scythians
syrians
armenians
cappadocians
bithynians
and
lycians
he
was
also
told
the
tributes
laid
upon
each
of
those
nations
the
weight
of
gold
and
silver
the
number
of
chariots
and
horses
the
gifts
of
ivory
and
scents
for
the
temples
and
the
quantity
of
grain
which
the
conquered
provinces
sent
to
feed
the
population
of
thebes
after
listening
to
the
musical
statue
of
amenhothes
germanicus
went
on
to
elephantine
and
syênê
and
on
his
return
he
turned
aside
to
the
pyramids
and
the
lake
of
mceris
which
regulated
the
overflow
of
the
nile
on
the
neighbouring
fields
at
memphis
germanicus
consulted
the
sacred
bull
apis
as
to
his
future
fortune
and
met
with
an
unfavourable
answer
the
manner
of
consulting
apis
was
for
the
visitor
to
hold
out
some
food
in
his
hand
and
the
answer
was
understood
to
be
favourable
if
the
bull
turned
his
head
to
eat
but
unfavourable
if
he
looked
another
way
when
germanicus
accordingly
held
out
a
handful
of
grain
the
animal
turned
his
head
sullenly
towards
the
other
side
of
his
stall
and
on
the
death
of
this
young
prince
which
shortly
followed
the
egyptians
did
not
forget
to
praise
the
foresight
this
blameless
and
seemingly
praiseworthy
visit
of
germanicus
did
not
however
escape
the
notice
of
the
jealous
tiberius
he
had
been
guilty
of
gaining
the
love
of
the
people
by
walking
about
without
guards
in
a
plain
greek
dress
and
of
lowering
the
price
of
grain
in
a
famine
by
opening
the
public
granaries
and
tiberius
sternly
reproached
him
with
breaking
the
known
law
of
augustus
by
which
no
roman
citizen
of
consular
or
even
of
equestrian
rank
might
enter
alexandria
without
leave
from
the
emperor
there
were
at
this
time
about
a
million
of
jews
in
egypt
in
alexandria
they
seem
to
have
been
about
of
the
population
as
they
formed
the
majority
in
two
wards
out
of
the
five
into
which
the
city
was
divided
they
lived
under
their
own
elders
and
sanhedrim
going
up
at
their
solemn
feasts
to
worship
in
their
own
temple
at
onion
but
from
their
mixing
with
the
greeks
they
had
become
less
strict
than
their
hebrew
brethren
in
their
observance
of
the
traditions
some
few
of
them
however
held
themselves
in
obedience
to
the
sanhedrim
in
jerusalem
and
looked
upon
the
temple
of
jerusalem
as
the
only
jewish
temple
and
these
men
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
an
embassy
on
the
stated
solemn
feasts
of
the
nation
to
offer
the
appointed
sacrifices
and
prayers
to
jahveh
in
the
holy
city
on
their
behalf
but
though
the
decree
by
cæsar
which
declared
that
the
jews
were
alexandrian
citizens
was
engraved
on
a
pillar
in
the
city
yet
they
were
by
no
means
treated
as
such
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
greeks
or
by
the
egyptians
illustration
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
when
during
the
famine
the
public
granaries
seemed
unable
to
supply
the
whole
city
with
food
even
the
humane
germanicus
ordered
that
the
jews
like
the
egyptians
should
have
no
share
of
the
gift
they
were
despised
even
by
the
egyptians

to
insult
them
said
that
the
wicked
god
typhon
had
two
sons
hierosolymus

these

jews

lake

was
a
little
colony
of
jews
who
joining
their
own
religion
with
the
mystical
opinions
and
gloomy
habits
of
the
egyptians
have
left
us
one
of
the
earliest
known
examples
of
the
monastic
life
they
bore
the
name
of
therapeutæ
they
had
left
says
philo
their
worldly
wealth
to
their
families
or
friends
they
had
forsaken
wives
children
brethren
parents
and
the
society
of
men
to
bury
themselves
in
solitude
and
pass
their
lives
in
the
contemplation
of
the
divine
essence
seized
by
this
heavenly
love
they
were
eager
to
enter
upon
the
next
world
as
though
they
were
already
dead
to
this
every
one
whether
man
or
woman
lived
alone
in
his
cell
or
monastery
caring
for
neither
food
nor
raiment
but
having
his
thoughts
wholly
turned
to
the
law
and
the
prophets
or
to
sacred
hymns
of
their
own
composing
they
had
their
god
always
in
their
thoughts
and
even
the
broken
sentences
which
they
uttered
in
their
dreams
were
treasures
of
religious
wisdom
they
prayed
every
morning
at
sunrise
and
then
spent
the
day
in
turning
over
the
sacred
volumes
and
the
commentaries
which
explained
the
allegories
or
pointed
out
a
secondary
meaning
as
hidden
beneath
the
surface
of
even
the
historical
books
of
the
old
testament
at
sunset
they
again
prayed
and
then
tasted
their
first
and
only
meal
selfdenial
indeed
was
the
foundation
of
all
their
virtues
some
made
only
three
meals
in
the
week
that
their
meditations
might
be
more
free
while
others
even
attempted
to
prolong
their
fast
to
the
sixth
day
during
six
days
of
the
week
they
saw
nobody
not
even
one
another
on
the
seventh
day
they
met
together
in
the
synagogue
here
they
sat
each
according
to
his
age
the
women
separated
from
the
men
each
wore
a
plain
modest
robe
which
covered
the
arms
and
hands
and
they
sat
in
silence
while
one
of
the
elders
preached
as
they
studied
the
mystic
powers
of
numbers
they
thought
the
number
seven
was
a
holy
number
and
that
seven
times
seven
made
a
great
week
and
hence
they
kept
the
fiftieth
day
as
a
solemn
festival
on
that
day
they
dined
together
the
men
on
one
side

other

spoke
unless
it
was
to
propose
a
question
out
of
the

to
answer
the
question

thus
quitted
the
active
duties
of
life
and
it
would
seem
that
the
therapeutas
rather
borrowed
their
customs
from
the
country
in
which
they
had
settled
than
from
any
sects
of
the
jewish
nation
some
classes
of
the
egyptian
priesthood
had
always
held
the
same
views
of
their
religious
duties
these
egyptian
monks
slept
on
a
hard
bed
of
palm
branches
with
a
still
harder
wooden
pillow
for
the
head
they
were
plain
in
their
dress
slow
in
walking
spare
in
diet
and
scarcely
allowed
themselves
to
smile
they
washed
thrice
a
day
and
prayed
as
often
at
sunrise
at
noon
and
at
sunset
they
often
fasted
from
animal
food
and
at
all
times
refused
many
meats
as
unclean
they
passed
their
lives
alone
either
in
study
or
wrapped
in
religious
thought
they
never
met
one
another
but
at
set
times
and
were
seldom
seen
by
strangers
thus
leaving
to
others
the
pleasures
wealth
and
lesser
prizes
of
this
life
they
received
from
them
in
return
what
most
men
value
higher
namely
honour
fame
and
power
the
romans
like
the
greeks
feeling
but
little
partiality
in
favour
of
their
own
gods
were
rarely
guilty
of
intolerance
against
those
of
others
and
would
hardly
have
checked
the
introduction
of
a
new
religion
unless
it
made
its
followers
worse
citizens
but
in
rome
where
every
act
of
its
civil
or
military
authorities
was
accompanied
with
a
religious
rite
any
slight
towards
the
gods
was
a
slight
towards
the
magistrate
many
devout
romans
had
begun
to
keep
holy
the
seventh
day
and
egypt
was
now
so
closely
joined
to
italy
that
the
roman
senate
made
a
new
law
against
the
egyptian
and
jewish
superstitions
and
in
banished
to
sardinia
four
thousand
men
who
were
found
guilty
of
being
jews
egypt
had
lost
with
its
liberties
its
gold
coinage
and
it
was
now
made
to
feel
a
further
proof
of
being
a
conquered
country
in
having
its
silver
much
alloyed
with
copper
but
tiberius
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
reign
altogether
stopped
the
alexandrian
mint
as
well
as
those
of
the
other
cities
which
occasionally
coined
and
after
this
year
we
find
no
more
coins
but
the
few
with
the
head
and
name
of
augustus
cæsar
which
seem
hardly
to
have
been
meant
for
money
but
to
commemorate
on
some
peculiar
occasions
the
adoption
by
his
stepfather
the
nubian
gold
mines
were
probably
by
this
time
wholly
deserted
they
had
been
so
far
worked
out
as
to
be
no
longer
profitable
for
fifteen
hundred
years
ever
since
ethiopia
was
conquered
by
thebes
wages
and
prices
had
been
higher
in
egypt
than
in
the
neighbouring
countries
but
this
was
now
no
longer
the
case
egypt
had
been
getting
poorer
during
the
reigns
of
the
latter
ptolemies
and
by
this
time
it
is
probable
that
both
wages
and
prices
were
higher
in
rome
it
seems
to
have
been
usual
to
change
the
prefect
of
egypt
every
few
years
and
the
was
often
sent
to
alexandria
to
wait
till
his
term
of
years
had
ended
thus
in
this
reign
of
years
æmilius
rectus
was
succeeded
by
vetrasius
pollio
and
on
his
death
tiberius
gave
the
government
to
his
freedman
iberus
during
the
last
five
years
egypt
was
under
the
able
but
stern
government
of
flaccus
avillius
whose
name
is
carved
on
the
temple
of
tentyra
with
that
of
the
emperor
he
was
a
man
who
united
all
those
qualities
of
prudent
forethought
with
prompt
execution
and
attention
to
business
which
was
so
necessary
in
controlling
the
irritable
alexandrians
who
were
liable
to
be
fired
into
rebellion
by
the
smallest
spark
justice
was
administered
fairly
the
great
were
not
allowed
to
tyrannise
over
the
poor
nor
the
people
to
meet
in
tumultuous
mobs
and
the
legions
were
regularly
paid
so
that
they
had
no
excuse
for
plundering
the
egyptians
on
the
death
of
tiberius
in
the
old
quarrel
again
broke
out
between
jews
and
greeks
the
alexandrians
were
not
slow
in
learning
the
feelings
of
his
successor
caius
or
caligula
towards
the
jews
nor
in
turning
against
them
the
new
law
that
the
statue
should
be
honoured
in
every
temple
of
the
empire
they
had
very
unwillingly
yielded
a
to
the
law
of
augustus
that
the
jews
should
still
be
allowed
the
privileges
of
citizenship
and
as
soon
as
they
heard
that
caligula
was
to
be
worshipped
in
every
temple
of
the
empire
they
denounced
the
jews
as
traitors
and
rebels
who
refused
so
to
honour
the
emperor
in
their
synagogues
it
happened
unfortunately
that
their
countryman
king
agrippa
at
this
time
came
to
alexandria
he
had
full
leave
from
the
emperor
to
touch
there
as
being
the
quickest
and
most
certain
way
of
making
the
voyage
from
rome
to
the
seat
of
his
own
government
indeed
the
alexandrian
voyage
had
another
merit
in
the
eyes
of
a
jew
for
whereas
wooden
were
declared
by
the
law
to
be
unclean
an
exception
was
made
by
their
tradition
in
favour
of
the
larger
size
of
the
in
the
alexandrian
ships
agrippa
had
seen
egypt
before
on
his
way
to
rome
and
he
meant
to
make
no
stay
there
but
though
he
landed
purposely
after
dark
and
with
no
pomp
or
show
he
seems
to
have
raised
the
anger
of
the
prefect
flaccus
who
felt
jealous
at
any
man
of
higher
rank
than
himself
coming
into
his
province
the
greeks
fell
into
the
humour
and
during
the
stay
of
agrippa
in
alexandria
they
lampooned
him
in
songs
and
ballads
of
which
the
raillery
was
not
of
the
most
delicate
kind
they
mocked
him
by
leading
about
the
streets
a
poor
idiot
dressed
up
with
a
paper
crown
and
a
reed
for
a
sceptre
in
ridicule
of
his
rather
doubtful
right
to
the
style
of
royalty
as
these
insults
towards
the
friend
passed
wholly
unchecked
by
the
prefect
the
greeks
next
assaulted
the
jews
in
the
streets
and
attacked
their
houses
rooted
up
the
groves
of
trees
around
their
synagogues
and
tore
down
the
decree
by
which
the
privileges
of
citizenship
had
been
confirmed
to
them
the
greeks
then
proceeded
to
set
up
by
force
a
statue
of
the
emperor
in
each
jewish
synagogue
as
if
the
new
decree
had
included
those
places
of
worship
among
the
temples
and
not
finding
statues
enough
they
made
use
of
the
statues
of
the
ptolemies
which
they
carried
away
from
the
gymnasium
for
that
purpose
during
the
last
reign
under
the
stern
government
of
tiberius
flaccus
had
governed
with
justice
and
prudence
but
under
caligula
he
seemed
to
have
lost
all
judgment
in
his
zeal
against
the
jews
when
the
riots
in
the
streets
could
no
longer
be
overlooked
instead
of
defending
the
injured
party
he
issued
a
decree
in
which
he
styled
the
jews
foreigners
thus
at
one
word
robbing
them
of
their
privileges
and
condemning
them
unheard
by
this
the
greeks
were
hurried
forward
into
further
acts
of
injustice
and
the
jews
of
resistance
but
the
jews
were
the
weaker
party
they
were
overpowered
and
all
driven
into
one
ward
and
four
hundred
of
their
houses
in
the
other
wards
were
plundered
and
the
spoil
divided
as
if
taken
in
war
they
were
stoned
and
even
burnt
in
the
streets
if
they
ventured
forth
to
buy
food
for
their
families
flaccus
seized
and
scourged
in
the
theatre
of
their
venerable
councillors
and
to
show
them
that
they
were
no
longer
citizens
the
punishment
was
inflicted
by
the
hands
of
egyptian
executioners
while
the
city
was
in
this
state
of
riot
the
greeks
gave
out
that
the
jews
were
concealing
arms
and
flaccus
to
give
them
a
fresh
proof
that
they
had
lost
the
rights
of
citizenship
ordered
that
their
houses
should
be
forcibly
entered
and
searched
by
a
centurion
and
a
band
of
soldiers
during
their
troubles
the
jews
had
not
been
allowed
to
complain
to
the
emperor
or
to
send
an
embassy
to
rome
to
make
known
their
grievances
but
the
jewish
king
agrippa
who
was
on
his
way
from
rome
to
his
kingdom
forwarded
to
caligula
the
complaints
of
his
countrymen
the
jews
with
an
account
of
the
rebellious
state
of
alexandria
the
riots
it
is
true
had
been
wholly
raised
by
the
zeal
in
setting
up
the
statue
in
the
synagogues
to
be
worshipped
by
the
jews
and
in
carrying
into
effect
the
decree
but
as
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
his
province
quiet
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
recalled
and
punished
for
his
want
of
success
to
have
found
it
necessary
to
call
out
the
troops
was
of
course
a
fault
in
a
governor
but
doubly
so
at
a
time
and
in
a
province
where
a
successful
general
might
so
easily
become
a
formidable
rebel
accordingly
a
centurion
with
a
trusty
cohort
of
soldiers
was
sent
from
rome
for
the
recall
of
the
prefect
on
approaching
the
flat
coast
of
egypt
they
kept
the
vessel
in
deep
water
till
sunset
and
then
entered
the
harbour
of
alexandria
in
the
dark
the
centurion
on
landing
met
with
a
freedman
of
the
emperor
from
whom
he
learned
that
the
prefect
was
then
at
supper
entertaining
a
large
company
of
friends
the
freedman
led
the
cohort
quietly
into
the
palace
into
the
very
room
where
flaccus
was
sitting
at
table
and
the
first
tidings
that
he
heard
of
his
government
being
disapproved
of
in
rome
was
his
finding
himself
a
prisoner
in
his
own
palace
the
friends
stood
motionless
with
surprise
the
centurion
produced
the
order
for
what
he
was
doing
and
as
no
resistance
was
attempted
all
passed
off
quietly
flaccus
was
hurried
on
board
the
vessel
then
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
on
the
same
evening
and
immediately
taken
to
rome
it
so
happened
that
on
the
night
that
flaccus
was
seized
the
jews
had
met
together
to
celebrate
their
autumnal
feast
the
feast
of
the
tabernacles
not
as
in
former
years
with
joy
and
pomp
but
in
fear
in
grief
and
in
prayer
their
chief
men
were
in
prison
their
nation
smarting
under
its
wrongs
and
in
daily
fear
of
fresh
cruelties
and
it
was
not
without
alarm
that
they
heard
the
noise
of
soldiers
moving
to
and
fro
through
the
city
and
the
heavy
tread
of
the
guards
marching
by
torchlight
from
the
camp
to
the
palace
but
their
fear
was
soon
turned
into
joy
when
they
heard
that
flaccus
the
author
of
all
their
wrongs
was
already
a
prisoner
on
board
the
vessel
in
the
harbour
and
they
gave
glory
to
god
not
says
philo
that
their
enemy
was
going
to
be
punished
but
because
their
own
sufferings
were
at
an
end
the
jews
then
having
had
leave
given
them
by
the
prefect
sent
an
embassy
to
rome
at
the
head
of
which
was
philo
the
platonic
philosopher
who
was
to
lay
their
grievances
before
the
emperor
and
to
beg
for
redress
the
greeks
also
at
the
same
time
sent
their
embassy
at
the
head
of
which
was
the
learned
grammarian
apion
who
was
to
accuse
the
jews
of
not
worshipping
the
statue
of
the
emperor
and
to
argue
that
they
had
no
right
to
the
same
privileges
of
citizenship
with
those
who
boasted
of
their
macedonian
blood
but
as
the
jews
did
not
deny
the
charge
that
was
brought
against
them
caligula
would
hear
nothing
that
they
had
to
say
and
philo
withdrew
with
the
remark
the
emperor
is
against
us
god
will
be
our
we
learn
the
sad
tale
of
the
suffering
under
caligula
from
the
pages
of
their
own
historian
only
but
though
philo
may
have
felt
and
written
as
one
of
the
sufferers
his
truth
is
undoubted
he
was
a
man
of
unblemished
character
and
the
writer
of
greatest
learning
and
of
the
greatest
note
at
that
time
in
alexandria
being
also
of
a
great
age
he
well
deserved
the
honour
of
being
sent
on
the
embassy
to
caligula
he
was
in
religion
a
jew
in
his
philosophy
a
platonist
and
by
birth
an
egyptian
and
in
his
numerous
writings
we
may
trace
the
three
sources
from
which
he
drew
his
opinions
he
is
always
devotional
and
in
earnest
full
of
pure
and
lofty
thoughts
and
often
eloquent
his
fondness
for
the
mystical
properties
of
numbers
and
for
finding
an
allegory
or
secondary
meaning
in
the
plainest
narrative
seems
borrowed
from
the
egyptians
according
to
the
eastern
proverb
every
word
in
a
wise
book
has
meanings
and
this
mode
of
interpretation
was
called
into
use
by
the
necessity
which
the
jews
felt
of
making
the
old
testament
speak
a
meaning
more
agreeable
to
their
modern
views
of
religion
in
speculative
theology
he
seems
to
have
borrowed
less
from
moses
than
from
the
abstractions
of
plato
whose
shadowy
hints
he
has
embodied
in
a
more
solid
form
he
was
the
first
jewish
writer
that
applied
to
the
deity
the
mystical
notion
of
the
egyptians
that
everything
perfect
was
of
three
parts
writings
are
valuable
as
showing
the
steps
by
which
the
philosophy
of
greece
may
be
traced
from
the
writings
of
plato
to
those
of
justin
martyr
and
clemens
alexandrinus
they
give
us
the
earliest
example
of
how
the
mystical
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
was
formed
into
a
system
by
which
every
text
was
made
to
unfold
some
important
philosophic
or
religious
truth
to
the
learned
student
at
the
same
time
that
to
the
unlearned
reader
it
conveyed
only
the
simple
historic
fact
the
hellenistic
jews
while
suffering
under
severe
political
disabilities
had
taken
up
a
high
literary
position
in
alexandria
and
had
forced
their
opinions
into
the
notice
of
the
greeks
the
glowing
earnestness
of
their
philosophy
now
put
forward
in
a
platonic
dress
and
heir
improved
style
approaching
even
classic
elegance
laced
their
writings
on
a
lofty
eminence
far
above
anything
which
the
cold
lifeless
grammarians
of
the
museum
were
then
producing
apion
who
went
to
rome
to
plead
against
philo
was
a
native
of
the
great
oasis
but
as
he
was
born
of
greek
parents
he
claimed
and
received
the
title
and
privileges
of
an
alexandrian
which
he
denied
to
the
jews
who
were
born
in
the
city
he
had
studied
under
didymus
and
apollonius
and
euphranor
and
was
one
of
the
most
laborious
of
the
grammarians
and
editors
of
homer
all
his
writings
are
now
lost
some
of
them
were
attacks
upon
the
jews
and
their
religion
calling
in
question
the
truth
of
the
jewish
history
and
the
justice
of
that
claim
to
high
antiquity
and
to
these
attacks
we
owe
in
which
several
valuable
fragments
of
history
are
saved
by
being
quoted
against
the
pagans
in
support
of
the
old
testament
one
of
his
works
was
his
an
account
of
what
he
thought
most
curious
in
egypt
but
his
learned
trifling
is
now
lost
and
nothing
remains
of
it
but
his
account
of
the
meeting
between
androclus
and
the
lion
which
took
place
in
the
amphitheatre
at
rome
when
apion
was
there
on
his
embassy
androclus
was
a
runaway
slave
who
when
retaken
was
brought
to
rome
to
be
thrown
before
an
african
lion
for
the
amusement
of
the
citizens
and
as
a
punishment
for
his
flight
but
the
fierce
and
hungry
beast
instead
of
tearing
him
to
pieces
wagged
his
tail
at
him
and
licked
his
feet
it
seems
that
the
slave
when
he
fled
from
his
master
had
gained
the
friendship
of
the
lion
in
the
libyan
desert
first
by
pulling
a
thorn
out
of
his
foot
and
then
by
living
three
years
with
him
in
a
cave
and
when
both
were
brought
in
chains
to
rome
androclus
found
a
grateful
friend
in
the
amphitheatre
where
he
thought
to
have
met
with
a
cruel
death
we
may
for
a
moment
leave
our
history
to
bid
a
last
farewell
to
the
family
of
the
ptolemies
augustus
after
leading
selene
the
daughter
of
cleopatra
and
antony
through
the
streets
of
rome
in
his
triumph
had
given
her
in
marriage
to
the
younger
juba
the
historian
of
africa
and
about
the
same
time
he
gave
to
the
husband
the
kingdom
of
mauritania
the
inheritance
of
his
father
his
son
ptolemy
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
but
was
soon
turned
out
of
his
kingdom
we
trace
the
last
of
the
ptolemies
in
his
travels
through
greece
and
asia
minor
by
the
inscriptions
remaining
to
his
honour
the
citizens
of
xanthus
in
lycia
set
up
a
monument
to
him
and
at
athens
his
statue
was
placed
beside
that
of
philadelphus
in
the
gymnasium
of
ptolemy
near
the
temple
of
theseus
where
he
was
honoured
as
of
kin
he
was
put
to
death
by
caligula
drusilla
another
grandchild
of
cleopatra
and
antony
married
antonius
felix
the
procurator
of
judæa
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
who
was
also
named
drusilla
these
are
the
last
notices
that
we
meet
with
of
the
royal
family
of
egypt
as
soon
as
the
news
of
death
reached
egypt
the
joy
of
the
jews
knew
no
bounds
they
at
once
flew
to
arms
to
revenge
themselves
on
the
alexandrians
whose
streets
were
again
the
seat
of
civil
war
the
governor
did
what
he
could
to
quiet
both
parties
but
was
not
wholly
successful
till
the
decree
of
the
new
emperor
reached
alexandria
in
this
claudius
granted
to
the
jews
the
full
rights
of
citizenship
which
they
had
enjoyed
under
the
ptolemies
and
which
had
been
allowed
by
augustus
he
left
them
to
choose
their
own
high
priest
to
enjoy
their
own
religion
without
hindrance
and
he
repealed
the
laws
of
caligula
under
which
they
had
been
groaning
at
this
time
the
jewish
alabarch
in
egypt
was
demetrius
a
man
of
wealth
and
high
birth
who
had
married
mariamne
the
daughter
of
the
elder
agrippa
illustration
egyptian
the
government
under
claudius
was
mild
and
just
at
least
as
far
as
a
government
could
be
in
which
every
every
military
governor
and
every
was
supposed
to
enrich
himself
by
his
appointment
every
roman
officer
from
the
general
down
to
the
lowest
tribune
claimed
the
right
of
travelling
through
the
country
free
of
expense
and
seizing
the
carts
and
cattle
of
the
villagers
to
carry
him
forward
to
the
next
town
under
the
pretence
of
being
a
courier
on
the
public
service
but
we
have
a
decree
of
the
ninth
year
of
this
reign
carved
on
the
temple
in
the
great
oasis
in
which
cneius
capito
the
prefect
of
egypt
endeavours
to
put
a
stop
to
this
injustice
he
orders
that
no
traveller
shall
have
the
privilege
of
a
courier
unless
he
has
a
proper
warrant
and
that
then
he
shall
only
claim
a
free
lodging
that
clerks
in
the
villages
shall
keep
a
register
of
all
that
is
taken
on
account
of
the
public
service
and
that
if
anybody
make
an
unjust
claim
he
shall
pay
four
times
the
amount
to
the
informer
and
six
times
the
amount
to
the
emperor
but
royal
decrees
could
do
little
or
nothing
where
there
were
no
judges
to
enforce
them
and
the
people
of
upper
egypt
must
have
felt
this
law
as
a
cruel
insult
when
they
were
told
that
they
might
take
up
their
complaints
to
basilides
at
alexandria
the
employment
of
the
informer
is
a
full
acknowledgment
of
the
weakness
of
this
absolute
government
and
that
the
prefect
had
not
the
power
to
enforce
his
own
decrees
and
when
we
compare
this
law
with
that
of
alexander
on
his
conquest
of
the
country
we
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
why
egypt
rose
under
the
ptolemies
and
sunk
under
the
selfish
policy
of
augustus
claudius
was
somewhat
of
a
scholar
and
an
author
he
wrote
several
volumes
both
in
greek
and
in
latin
the
former
he
might
perhaps
think
would
be
chiefly
valued
in
alexandria
and
when
he
founded
a
new
college
in
that
city
called
after
himself
the
claudian
museum
he
ordered
that
on
given
days
every
year
his
history
of
carthage
should
be
publicly
read
in
one
museum
and
his
history
of
italy
in
the
other
thus
securing
during
his
reign
an
attention
to
his
writings
which
their
merits
alone
would
not
have
gained
under
the
government
of
claudius
the
egyptians
were
again
allowed
to
coin
money
and
in
his
first
year
begins
that
historically
important
series
in
which
every
coin
is
dated
with
the
year
of
the
reign
the
coins
of
the
ptolemies
were
strictly
greek
in
their
workmanship
and
the
few
egyptian
characters
that
we
see
upon
them
are
so
much
altered
by
the
classic
taste
of
the
that
we
hardly
know
them
again
but
it
is
far
otherwise
with
the
coins
of
the
emperors
which
are
covered
with
the
ornaments
characters
and
religious
ceremonies
of
the
native
egyptians
and
though
the
style
of
art
is
often
bad
they
are
scarcely
equalled
by
any
series
of
coins
whatever
in
the
service
they
render
to
the
historian
it
was
in
this
reign
that
the
route
through
egypt
to
india
first
became
really
known
to
the
greeks
and
romans
the
historian
pliny
who
died
in
has
left
us
a
contemporary
account
of
these
early
voyages
will
not
be
amiss
he
says
in
his
set
forth
the
whole
of
the
route
from
egypt
which
has
been
stated
to
us
of
late
upon
information
on
which
reliance
may
be
placed
and
is
here
published
for
the
first
time
the
subject
is
one
well
worthy
of
our
notice
seeing
that
in
no
year
does
india
drain
our
empire
of
less
than
five
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
sesterces
or
two
million
dollars
giving
back
her
own
wares
in
exchange
which
are
sold
among
us
at
fully
one
hundred
times
their
cost
price
miles
distant
from
alexandria
is
the
town
of
heliopolis
the
distance
thence
to
koptos
up
the
nile
is
three
hundred
and
eight
miles
the
voyage
is
performed
when
the
etesian
winds
are
blowing
in
twelve
days
from
koptos
the
journey
is
made
with
the
aid
of
camels
stations
being
arranged
at
intervals
for
the
supply
of
fresh
water
the
first
of
these
stations
is
called
hydreuma
and
is
distant
miles
the
second
is
situate
on
a
mountain
at
a
distance
of
one
journey
from
the
last
the
third
is
at
a
second
hydreuma
distant
from

miles
the
fourth
is
on
a
mountain
the
next
to
that
is
another
hydreuma
that
of
apollo
and
is
distant
from
koptos
one
hundred
and
miles
after
which
there
is
another
on
a
mountain
there
is
then
another
station
at
a
place
called
the
new
hydreuma
distant
from
koptos
two
hundred
and
thirty
miles
and
next
to
it
there
is
another
called
the
old
hydreuma
where
a
detachment
is
always
on
guard
with
a
caravansary
that
affords
lodging
for
two
thousand
persons
the
last
is
distant
from
the
new
hydreuma
seven
miles
after
leaving
it
we
come
to

city
of
berenicê
situate
upon
a
harbour
of
the
red
sea
and
distant
from
koptos
two
hundred
and
miles
the
greater
part
of
this
distance
is
generally
travelled
by
night
on
account
of
the
extreme
heat
the
day
being
spent
at
the

in

of
which
it

were

had
also
been
made
in

egypt
in
small
quantities
a
very
long
time
as
we
learn
from
the
monuments
but
it
was
produced
with
difficulty
and
cost
and
was
not
good
it
was
not
valued
by
the
greeks
it
was
poor

thin
and
drunk
only
by
those
who
were
feverish
and
afraid
of
anything
stronger
that
of
anthylla
to
the

of
alexandria
was
very
much
better
but
better
still
were
the
thick

grown
at

mareotic
wine
was

carelessly
said
of

she
was

better
knew
its
quality
says
that
the

drank
wine
far
stronger

wild
here

by
the

of
this

the

was
made
yet
more
fruitful
but
before

the

had
given

the

had
made
for
themselves
a

into

small

which

surrounded

thus
was
the
country
slowly
going
to
ruin
by
the
faults
of
the
government
and
ignorance
in
the
foreign
rulers
but
on
the
other
hand
the
beautiful
temple
of
latopolis
which
had
been
begun
under
the
ptolemies
was
finished
in
this
reign
and
bears
the
name
of
claudius

those
of
some
later
emperors
on
its
portico
and
walls
in
the
egyptian
language
the
word
for
a
year
is
which
is
also
the
name
of
a
bird
in
hieroglyphics
this
word
is
spelt
by
a
and
the
letter
t
followed
sometimes
by
a
circle
as
a
picture
of
the
year
hence
arose
among
a
people
fond
of
mystery
and
allegory
a
mode
of
speaking
of
the
year
under
the
name
of
a
or
of
a
bird
and
they
formed
a
fable
out
of
a
mere
confusion
of
words
the
greeks
who
were
not
slow
to
copy
egyptian
mysticism
called
this
fabulous
bird
the
from
their
own
name
for
the
the
end
of
any
long
period
of
time
they
called
the
return
of
the
phonix
to
earth
the
romans
borrowed
the
fable
though
perhaps
without
understanding
the
allegory
and
in
the
seventh
year
of
this
reign
when
the
emperor
celebrated
the
secular
games
at
rome
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
since
the
city
was
built
it
was
said
that
the
phoenix
had
come
to
egypt
and
was
thence
brought
to
rome
this
was
in
the
consulship
of
plautius
and
vitellius
and
it
would
seem
to
be
only
from
mistakes
in
the
name
that
pliny
places
the
event
eleven
years
earlier
in
the
consulship
of
plautius
and
papinius
and
that
tacitus
places
it
thirteen
years
earlier
in
the
consulship
of
fabius
and
vitellius
this
fable
is
connected
with
some
of
the
remarkable
epochs
in
egyptian
history
the
story
lost
nothing
by
travelling
to
a
distance
in
rome
it
was
said
that
this
wonderful
bird
was
a
native
of
arabia
where
it
lived
for
five
hundred
years
that
on
its
death
a
grub
came
out
of
its
body
which
in
due
time
became
a
perfect
bird
and
that
the
new
phonix
brought
to
egypt
the
bones
of
its
parent
in
the
nest
of
spices
in
which
it
had
died
and
laid
them
on
the
altar
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
in
heliopolis
it
then
returned
to
arabia
to
live
in
its
turn
for
five
hundred
years
and
die
and
give
life
again
to
another
as
before
the
christians
saw
in
this
story
a
type
of
the
resurrection
and
clement
bishop
of
rome
quotes
it
as
such
in
his
epistle
to
the
corinthians
we
find
the
name
of
claudius
on
several
of
the
temples
of
upper
egypt
particularly
on
that
of
apollinopolis
magna
and
on
the
portico
of
the
great
temples
of
latopolis
which
were
being
built
in
this
reign
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
nero
an
egyptian
jew
who
claimed
to
be
listened
to
as
a
prophet
raised
the
minds
of
his
countrymen
into
a
ferment
of
religious
zeal
by
preaching
about
the
sufferings
of
their
brethren
in
judæa
and
he
was
able
to
get
together
a
body
of
men
called
in
reproach
the
sicarii
or
whose
numbers
are
variously
stated
at
four
thousand
and
thirty
thousand
whom
he
led
out
of
egypt
to
free
the
holy
city
from
the
bondage
of
the
heathen
but
felix
the
roman
governor
led
against
them
the
garrison
of
jerusalem
and
easily
scattered
the
rabble
by
such
acts
of
religious
zeal
on
the
part
of
the
jews
they
were
again
brought
to
blows
with
the
greeks
of
alexandria
the
macedonians
as
the
latter
still
called
themselves
had
met
in
public
assembly
to
send
an
embassy
to
rome
and
some
jews
who
entered
the
meeting
which
as
citizens
they
had
a
full
right
to
do
were
seized
and
by
them
as
spies
they
would
perhaps
have
even
been
put
to
death
if
a
large
body
of
their
countrymen
had
not
run
to
their
rescue
the
jews
attacked
the
assembled
greeks
with
stones
and
lighted
torches
and
would
have
burned
the
amphitheatre
and
all
that
were
in
it
if
the
prefect
tiberius
alexander
had
not
sent
some
of
the
elders
of
their
own
nation
to
calm
their
angry
feelings
but
though
the
mischief
was
stopped
for
a
time
it
soon
broke
out
again
and
the
prefect
was
forced
to
call
out
the
garrison
of
two
roman
legions
and
five
thousand
libyans
before
he
could
peace
in
the
city
the
jews
were
always
the
greatest
sufferers
in
these
civil
broils
and
josephus
says
that
fifty
thousand
of
his
countrymen
were
left
dead
in
the
streets
of
alexandria
but
this
number
is
very
improbable
as
the
prefect
was
a
friend
to
the
jewish
nation
and
as
the
roman
legions
were
not
withdrawn
to
the
camp
till
they
had
guarded
the
jews
in
carrying
away
and
burying
the
bodies
of
their
friends
it
was
a
natural
policy
on
the
part
of
the
emperors
to
change
a
prefect
whenever
his
province
was
disturbed
by
rebellion
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
flaccus
who
was
recalled
by
caligula
it
was
easier
to
send
a
new
governor
than
to
inquire
into
a
wrong
or
to
redress
a
grievance
and
accordingly
in
the
next
year
balbillus
was
sent
from
rome
as
prefect
of
egypt
he
reached
alexandria
on
the
sixth
day
after
leaving
the
straits
of
sicily
which
was
spoken
of
as
the
quickest
voyage
known
the
alexandrian
ships
were
better
built
and
better
manned
than
any
others
and
as
a
greater
number
of
vessels
sailed
every
year
between
that
port
and
puteoli
on
the
coast
of
italy
than
between
any
other
two
places
no
voyage
was
better
understood
or
more
quickly
performed
they
were
out
of
sight
of
land
for
five
hundred
miles
between
syracuse
and
cyrene
hence
we
see
that
the
quickest
rate
of
sailing
with
a
fair
wind
was
at
that
time
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
the
hours
but
these
ships
had
very
little
power
of
bearing
up
against
the
wind
and
if
it
were
contrary
the
voyage
became
tedious
if
the
captain
on
sailing
out
of
the
port
of
alexandria
found
the
wind
westerly
and
was
unable
to
creep
along
the
african
coast
to
cyrene
he
stood
over
to
the
coast
of
asia
minor
in
hopes
of
there
finding
a
more
favourable
wind
if
a
storm
arose
he
ran
into
the
nearest
port
perhaps
in
crete
perhaps
in
malta
there
to
wait
the
return
of
fair
weather
if
winter
then
came
on
he
had
to
lie
by

a
vessel
laden
with
egyptian
wheat
leaving
alexandria
in
september
after
the
harvest
had
been
brought
down
to
the
coast
would
sometimes
spend
five
months
on
its
voyage
from
that
port
to
puteoli
such
was
the
case
with
the
ship
bearing
the
children
of
jove
as
its
figurehead
which
picked
up
the
apostle
paul
and
the
historian
josephus
when
they
had
been
wrecked
together
on
the
island
of
malta
and
such
perhaps
would
have
been
the
case
with
the
ship
which
they
before
found
on
the
coast
of
lycia
had
it
been
able
to
reach
a
safe
harbour

fragment
containing

nineteen
characters
still
remains
to
us

he
is
not
always
right
he
thinks
the
characters
were
used
allegorically
for
thoughts
not
for
sounds

of
the

peter
many
were
already
craving

more
real
than
the
old

the
egyptian
had
been
shaken
in
his
attachment
to
the
sacred
animals
by
greek
ridicule
the
greek
had
been
weakened
in
his
belief
of
old
gods
by
living
with
men
who
had
never
heard
of
them
both
were
dissatisfied
with
the
scheme
of
explaining
the
actions
of
their
gods
by
means
of

the
crumbling

of
the
old
opinions
left

more
fitted
to

the
new
religion

crowds
in
alexandria
but
after
a
short
stay
he
returned
to
rome
in
about
the
eleventh
year
of
this
reign
leaving
annianus
to
watch
over
the
growing
church
annianus
is
usually
called
the
first
bishop
of
alexandria
and
eusebius
who
lived
two
hundred
years
later
has
given
us
the
names
of
his
successors
in
an
unbroken
chain
if
we
would
inquire
whether
the
early
converts
to
christianity
in
alexandria
were
jews
greeks
or
egyptians
we
have
nothing
to
guide
us
but
the
names
of
these
bishops
annianus
or
annaniah
as
his
name
was
written
by
the
arabic
historians
was
very
likely
a
jew
indeed
the
evangelist
mark
would
begin
by
addressing
himself
to
the
jews
and
would
leave
the
care
of
the
infant
church
to
one
of
his
own
nation
in
the
platonic
jews
christianity
found
soil
so
exactly
suited
to
its
reception
that
it
is
only
by
he
dates
that
the
thérapeute
of
alexandria
and
their
historian
philo
are
proved
not
to
be
christian
and
again
it
was
in
the
close
union
between
the
platonic
jews
and
the
platonists
that
christianity
found
its
easiest
path
to
the
ears
and
hearts
of
the
pagans
the
bishops
that
followed
seem
to
have
been
greek
converts
before
the
death
of
annaniah
jerusalem
had
been
destroyed
by
the
roman
armies
and
the
jews
sunk
in
their
own
eyes
and
in
those
of
their
throughout
the
empire
hence
the
second
bishop
of
alexandria
was
less
likely
to
be
of
hebrew
blood
and
it
was
long
before
any
egyptians
aimed
at
rank
in
the
church
but
though
the
spread
of
christianity
was
rapid
both
among
the
greeks
and
the
egyptians
we
must
not
hope
to
find
any
early
traces
of
it
in
the
historians
it
was
at
first
embraced
by
the
unlearned
and
the
poor
whose
deeds
and
opinions
are
seldom
mentioned
in
history
and
we
may
readily
believe
the
scornful
reproach
of
the
unbelievers
that
it
was
chiefly
received
by
the
unfortunate
the
unhappy
the
despised
and
the
sinful
when
the
priestesses
of
ceres
carried
the
sacred
basket
through
the
streets
of
alexandria
they
cried
out
away
or
keep
your
eyes
to
the
ground
keep
your
eyes
to
the
ground
when
the
crier
standing
on
the
steps

the
portico
in
front
of
the
great
temple
called
upon
the
pagans
to
come
near
and
join
in
the
celebration

their
mysteries
he
cried

who
are
clean

hands
and
pure
of
heart

to
the
sacrifice
all
ye
who
are
guiltless
in
thought
and
deed
come
to
the
but
many
a
repentant
sinner
and
humble
spirit
must
have
drawn
back
in
distrust
from
a
summons
which
to
him
was
so
forbidding
and
been
glad
to
hear
the
good
tidings
of
mercy
offered
by
christianity
to
those
who
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
to
the
who
would
turn
away
from
their
wickedness
while
such
were
the
chief
followers
of
the
gospel
it
was
not
likely
to
be
much
noticed
by
the
historians
and
we
must
wait
till
it
forced
its
way
into
the
schools
and
the
palace

we
shall
find

the

with
which

ethiopian
arabs
kept
up
their

most
dreaded

the
blemmyes

uncivilised
people
described
by
the
affrighted
neighbours
as
having
no

with

it

under

when
in

proposed
to
punish

these
troublesome
neighbours

sent
forward

guard

soldiers
he
reported
on

the

country
was
a
desert
and
that
there
was
scarcely
a
city
inhabited
on
either
side

the

to

when
the
news
reached
him
that
otho
was
dead
and
that
vitellius
had
been
raised
to
the
purple
by
the
german
legions
and
acknowledged
at
rome
and
without
wasting
more
time
in
refusing
the
honour
than
was
necessary
to
prove
that
his
soldiers
were
in
earnest
in
offering
it
he
allowed
himself
to
be
proclaimed
emperor
as
the
successor
of
otho
he
would
not
however
then
risk
a
march
upon
rome
but
he
sent
to
alexandria
to
tell
tiberius
alexander
the
governor
of
egypt
what
he
had
done
he
ordered
him
to
claim
in
his
name
the
allegiance
of
that
great
province
and
added
that
he
should
soon
be
there
himself
the
two
roman
legions
in
egypt
much
preferred
the
choice
of
the
eastern
to
that
of
the
western
army
and
the
alexandrians
who
had
only
just
acknowledged
vitellius
readily
took
the
oath
to
be
faithful
to
vespasian
this
made
it
less
necessary
for
him
to
hasten
thither
and
he
only
reached
alexandria
in
time
to
hear
that
vitellius
had
been
murdered
after
a
reign
of
eight
months
and
that
he
himself
had
been
acknowledged
as
emperor
by
rome
and
the
western
legions
his
egyptian
coins
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
by
the
word
point
to
the
end
of
the
civil
war
when
vespasian
entered
alexandria
he
was
met
by
the
philosophers
and
magistrates
in
great
pomp
the
philosophers
indeed
in
a
city
where
beside
the
officers
of
government
talent
formed
the
only
aristocracy
were
a
very
important
body
and
dion
euphrates
and
apollonius
had
been
useful
in
securing
for
vespasian
the
allegiance
of
the
alexandrians
dion
was
an
orator
who
had
been
professor
of
rhetoric
but
he
had
given
up
that
study
for
philosophy
his
orations
or
declamations
gained
for
him
the
name
of
chrysostom
or
euphrates
his
friend
was
a
platonist
who
afterwards
married
the
daughter
of
the
prefect
of
syria
and
removed
to
rome
apollonius
of
tyana
the
most
celebrated
of
these
philosophers
was
one
of
the
first
who
gained
his
eminence
from
the
study
of
eastern
philosophy
which
was
then
rising
in
the
opinions
of
the
greeks
as
highly
worth
their
notice
he
had
been
travelling
in
the
east
and
boasting
that
he
was
already
master
of
all
the
fabled
wisdom
of
the
magi
of
babylon
and
of
the
gymnosophists
of
india
he
was
come
to
egypt
to
compare
this
mystic
philosophy
with
that
of
the
hermits
of
ethiopia
and
the
thebaid
addressing
himself
as
a
pupil
to
the
priests
he
willingly
yielded
his
belief
to
their
mystic
claims
and
whether
from
being
deceived
or
as
a
deceiver
whether
as
an
enthusiast
or
as
a
cheat
he
pretended
to
have
learned
all
the
supernatural
knowledge
which
they
pretended
to
teach
by
the
egyptians
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
favourite
of
heaven
he
claimed
the
power
of
working
miracles
by
his
magical
arts
and
of
foretelling
events
by
his
knowledge
of
astrology
in
the
thebaid
he
was
so
far
honoured
that
at
the
bidding
of
the
priests
one
of
the
sacred
trees
spoke
to
him
as
had
been
their
custom
from
of
old
with
favourites
and
in
a
clear
and
rather
womanly
voice
addressed
him
as
a
teacher
from
heaven
it
was
to
witness
such
practices
as
these
and
to
learn
the
art
of
deceiving
their
followers
that
the
egyptian
priests
were
now
consulted
by
the
greeks
the
oracle
at
delphi
was
silent
but
the
oracle
of
ammon
continued
to
return
an
answer
the
mystic
philosophy
of
the
east
had
come
into
fashion
in
alexandria
and
the
priests
were
more
celebrated
as
magicians
than
as
philosophers
they
would
tell
a
fortune
and
the
year
that
he
was
to
die
by
examining
the
lines
of
his
forehead
some
of
them
even
undertook
for
a
sum
of
money
to
raise
the
dead
to
life
or
rather
to
recall
for
a
time
to
earth
the
unwilling
spirits
and
make
them
answer
any
questions
that
might
be
put
to
them
ventriloquism
was
an
art
often
practised
in
egypt
and
perhaps
invented
there
by
this
the
priests
gained
a
power
over
the
minds
of
the
listeners
and
could
make
them
believe
that
a
tree
a
statue
or
a
dead
body
was
speaking
to
them
the
alexandrian
men
of
letters
seldom
erred
by
wrapping
themselves
up
in
pride
to
avoid
the
fault
of
meanness
they
usually
cringed
to
the
great
apollonius
was
wholly
at
the
service
of
vespasian
and
the
emperor
repaid
the
philosopher
by
flattery
as
well
as
by
more
solid
favours
he
kept
him
always
by
his
side
during
his
stay
in
egypt
he
acknowledged
his
rank
as
a
prophet
and
tried
to
make
further
use
of
him
in
persuading
the
egyptians
of
his
own
divine
right
to
the
throne
vespasian
begged
him
to
make
use
of
his
prayers
that
he
might
obtain
from
god
the
empire
which
he
had
as
yet
hardly
grasped
but
apollonius
claiming
even
a
higher
mission
from
heaven
than
vespasian
was
granting
to
him
answered
with
as
much
arrogance
as
flattery
have
myself
already
made
you
with
the
intimacy
between
vespasian
and
apollonius
begins
the
use
of
gnostic
emblems
on
the
alexandrian
coins
the
imperial
pupil
was
not
slow
in
learning
from
such
a
master
and
the
people
were
as
ready
to
believe
in
the
miracles
as
in
the
as
vespasian
was
walking
through
the
streets
of
alexandria
a
man
well
known
as
having
a
disease
in
his
eyes
threw
himself
at
his
feet
and
begged
of
him
to
heal
his
blindness
he
had
been
told
by
the
god
serapis
that
he
should
regain
his
sight
if
the
emperor
would
but
deign
to
spit
upon
his
eyelids
another
man
who
had
lost
the
use
of
a
hand
had
been
told
by
the
same
god
that
he
should
be
healed
if
the
emperor
would
but
trample
on
him
with
his
feet
vespasian
at
first
laughed
at
them
and
thrust
them
off
but
at
last
he
so
far
yielded
to
their
prayers
and
to
the
flattery
of
his
friends
as
to
have
the
physicians
of
alexandria
consulted
whether
it
was
in
his
power
to
heal
these
unfortunate
men
the
physicians
like
good
courtiers
were
not
so
unwise
as
to
think
it
impossible
besides
it
seemed
meant
by
the
god
as
a
public
proof
of
right
to
the
throne
if
he
were
successful
the
glory
would
be
his
and
if
he
failed
the
laugh
would
be
against
the
cripples
the
two
men
were
therefore
brought
before
him
and
in
the
face
of
the
assembled
citizens
he
trampled
on
one
and
spit
on
the
other
and
his
flatterers
declared
that
he
had
healed
the
maimed
and
given
sight
to
the
blind
vespasian
met
with
further
wonders
when
he
entered
the
temple
of
serapis
to
consult
the
god
as
to
the
state
and
fortunes
of
the
empire
he
went
into
the
inner
sanctuary
alone
and
to
his
surprise
there
he
beheld
the
old
basilides
the
freedman
of
claudius
one
of
the
chief
men
of
alexandria
whom
he
knew
was
then
lying
dangerously
ill
and
several
journey
from
the
city
he
inquired
of
the
priests
whether
basilides
had
been
in
the
temple
and
was
assured
that
he
had
not
he
then
asked
whether
he
had
been
in
alexandria
but
nobody
had
seen
him
there
lastly
on
sending
messengers
he
learned
that
he
was
on
his
eighty
miles
off
with
this
miracle
before
his
eyes
he
could
not
distrust
the
answers
which
the
priests
gave
to
his
questions
from
alexandria
vespasian
sent
back
titus
to
finish
the
siege
of
jerusalem
the
jewish
writer
joseph
the
son
of
matthias
or
flavius
josephus
as
he
called
himself
when
he
entered
the
service
of
the
emperor
was
then
in
alexandria
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
vespasian
but
had
gained
his
freedom
by
the
betrayal
of
his
cause
he
joined
the
army
of
titus
and
marched
to
the
overthrow
of
jerusalem
notwithstanding
the
obstinate
and
heroic
struggles
of
the
jews
judæa
was
wholly
conquered
by
the
romans
and
jerusalem
and
its
other
fortresses
either
received
roman
garrisons
or
were
dismantled
the
temple
was
overthrown
in
the
month
of
september
titus
made
slaves
of
thousand
men
many
of
whom
he
led
with
him
into
egypt
and
then
sent
them
to
work
in
the
mines
these
were
soon
followed
by
a
crowd
of
other
brave
jews
who
chose
rather
to
quit
their
homes
and
live
as
wanderers
in
egypt
than
to
own
vespasian
as
their
king
they
knew
no
lord
but
jahveh
to
take
the
oaths
or
to
pay
tribute
to
cæsar
was
to
renounce
the
faith
of
their
fathers
but
they
found
no
safety
in
egypt
their
greek
brethren
turned
against
them
and
handed
six
hundred
of
them
up
to
lupus
the
governor
of
egypt
to
be
punished
and
their
countryman
josephus
brands
them
all
with
the
name
of
sicarii
they
tried
to
hide
themselves
in
thebes
and
other
cities
less
under
the
eyes
of
the
roman
governor
they
were
however
followed
and
taken
and
the
courage
with
which
the
boys
and
mere
children
bore
their
sufferings
sooner
than
acknowledge
vespasian
for
their
king
drew
forth
the
praise
of
even
the
josephus
the
greek
jews
of
egypt
gained
nothing
by
this
treachery
towards
their
hebrew
brethren
they
were
themselves
looked
down
upon
by
the
alexandrians
and
distrusted
by
the
romans
the
emperor
ordered
lupus
to
shut
up
the
temple
at
onion
near
heliopolis
in
which
during
the
last
three
hundred
years
they
had
been
allowed
to
have
an
altar
in
rivalry
to
the
temple
of
jerusalem
even
josephus
whose
betrayal
of
his
countrymen
might
have
saved
him
from
their
enemies
was
sent
with
many
others
in
chains
to
rome
and
was
only
set
free
on
his
making
himself
known
to
titus
indeed
when
the
hebrew
jews
lost
their
capital
and
their
rank
as
a
nation
their
brethren
felt
lowered
in
the
eyes
of
their
in
whatever
city
they
dwelt
and
in
alexandria
they
lost
all
hope
of
keeping
their
privileges
although
the
emperor
refused
to
repeal
the
edict
which
granted
them
their
citizenship
an
edict
to
which
they
always
appealed
for
protection
but
often
with
very
little
success
the
alexandrians
were
sadly
disappointed
in
vespasian
they
had
been
among
the
first
to
acknowledge
him
as
emperor
while
his
power
was
yet
doubtful
and
they
looked
for
a
sum
of
money
as
a
largess
but
to
their
sorrow
he
increased
the
taxes
and
some
which
had
fallen
into
disuse
they
had
a
joke
against
him
about
his
claiming
from
one
of
his
friends
the
trifling
debt
of
six
oboli
and
upon
hearing
of
their
witticisms
he
was
so
angry
that
he
ordered
this
sum
of
six
oboli
to
be
levied
as
a
upon
every
man
in
the
city
and
he
only
remitted
the
tax
at
the
request
of
his
son
titus
he
went
to
rome
carrying
with
him
the
nickname
of
cybiosactes
which
the
alexandrians
gave
him
for
his
stinginess
and
greediness
and
which
they
had
before
given
to
seleucus
who
robbed
the
tomb
of
alexander
the
great
at
alexandria
of
its
famous
golden
sarcophagus
titus
saw
the
importance
of
pleasing
the
people
and
his
wish
to
humour
their
ancient
prejudices
at
the
ceremony
of
consecrating
a
new
bull
as
apis
brought
some
blame
upon
him
he
there
as
became
the
occasion
wore
the
state
crown
and
dazzled
the
people
of
memphis
with
his
regal
pomp
but
while
thus
endeavouring
to
strengthen
his
throne
he
was
by
some
accused
of
grasping
at
it
for
himself
the
great
temple
of
kneph
at
latopolis
which
had
been
the
work
of
many
reigns
and
perhaps
many
centuries
was
finished
under
vespasian
it
is
a
building
worthy
of
the
best
times
of
egyptian
architecture
it
has
a
grand
portico
upheld
by
four
rows
of
massive
columns
with
capitals
in
the
form
of
papyrus
flowers
on
the
ceiling
is
a
zodiac
like
that
at
tentyra
and
though
many
other
names
are
carved
on
the
walls
that
of
vespasian
is
in
the
dedication
over
the
entrance
of
the
reign
of
titus
in
egypt
we
find
no
trace
beyond
his
coins
struck
each
year
at
alexandria
and
his
name
carved
on
one
or
two
temples
which
had
been
built
in
former
reigns
of
the
reign
of
domitian
we
learn
something
from
the
poet
juvenal
who
then
held
a
military
post
in
the
province
and
he
gives
us
a
sad
account
of
the
state
of
lawlessness
in
which
the
troops
lived
under
his
commands
all
quarrels
between
soldiers
and
citizens
were
tried
by
the
officers
according
to
martial
law
and
justice
was
very
far
from
being
between
the
roman
and
the
poor
egyptian
no
witness
was
bold
enough
to
come
forward
and
say
anything
against
a
soldier
while
everybody
was
believed
who
spoke
on
his
behalf
juvenal
was
at
a
great
age
when
he
was
sent
into
egypt
and
he
felt
that
the
command
of
a
cohort
on
the
very
borders
of
the
desert
was
a
cruel
banishment
from
the
literary
society
of
rome
his
death
in
the
camp
was
hastened
by
his
wish
to
return
home
as
what
juvenal
chiefly
aimed
at
in
his
writings
was
to
lash
the
follies
of
the
age
he
of
course
found
plenty
of
amusement
in
the
superstitions
and
sacred
animals
of
egypt
but
he
sometimes
takes
a
liberty
and
when
he
tells
us
that
was
almost
the
only
flesh
that
they
ate
without
sinning
we
need
not
believe
him
to
the
letter
he
gives
a
lively
picture
of
a
fight
which
he
saw
between
the
citizens
of
two
towns
the
towns
of
ombos
and
tentyra
though
about
a
hundred
miles
apart
had
a
quarrel
about
their
gods
at
ombos
they
worshipped
the
crocodile
and
the
god
savak
while
at
tentyra
they
worshipped
the
goddess
hâthor
and
were
celebrated
for
their
skill
in
catching
and
killing
crocodiles
so
taking
advantage
of
a
feast
or
holiday
they
marched
out
for
a
fight
the
men
of
ombos
avere
beaten
and
put
to
flight
but
one
of
them
stumbling
as
he
ran
away
was
caught
and
torn
to
pieces
and
as
juvenal
adds
eaten
by
the
men
of
tentyra
their
worship
of
beasts
birds
and
fishes
and
even
growing
their
gods
in
the
garden
are
pleasantly
hit
off
by
him
they
left
nothing
said
he
without
worship
but
the
goddess
of
chastity
the
mother
goddess
isis
the
queen
of
heaven
was
the
deity
to
whom
they
bowed
with
the
most
tender
devotion
and
to
swear
by
isis
was
their
favourite
oath
and
hence
the
leek
in
their
own
language
named
isi
was
no
doubt
the
vegetable
called
a
god
by
the
satiric
juvenal
at
the
same
time
also
the
towns
of
oxyrrhynchos
and
cynopolis
in
the
heptanomos
had
a
little
civil
war
about
the
animals
which
they
worshipped
somebody
at
cynopolis
was
said
to
have
caught
an
oxyrrhynchus
fish
in
the
nile
and
eaten
it
and
so
the
people
of
oxyrrhynchos
in
revenge
made
an
attack
upon
the
dogs
the
gods
of
cynopolis
they
caught
a
number
of
them
killed
them
in
sacrifice
to
their
offended
and
ate
them
the
two
parties
then
flew
to
arms
and
fought
several
battles
they
sacked
one
cities
in
turns
and
the
war
was
not
stopped
till
the
roman
troops
marched
to
the
spot
and
punished
them
both
but
we
gain
a
more
agreeable
and
most
likely
a
more
true
notion
of
the
mystical
religion
and
philosophy
of
the
egyptians
in
these
days
from
the
serious
enquiries
of
plutarch
who
instead
of
looking
for
what
he
could
laugh
at
was
only
too
ready
to
believe
that
he
saw
wisdom
hidden
under
an
allegory
in
all
their
superstitions
many
of
the
habits
of
the
priests
such
as
shaving
the
whole
body
wearing
linen
instead
of
cotton
and
refusing
some
meats
as
impure
seem
to
have
arisen
from
a
love
of
cleanliness
their
religion
ordered
what
was
useful
and
it
also
forbade
what
was

so
to
stir
the
fire
with
a
sword
was
displeasing
to
the

it
spoilt

the

who
acted
with

with

providence
were
the
authors
of
all
good
and
though
these
like
the
sun

were
called
in

by
a
different

outward
ceremonies
in
religion
were
no
longer
thought
enough
without
a
good
life
and
as
the
greeks
said
that
beard
and
cloak
did
not
make
a
philosopher
so
the
egyptians
said
that
white
linen

a

would
not

all
the
sacrifices
to
the
gods
had
a
secondary
meaning

at
least
they
tried
to
join
a
moral
aim
to
the
outward
act
as
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
month
when
they
ate
honey
and

in
honour

thot
they
sang
is
the
egyptians
like
most
other
eastern
polytheists
held
the
doctrine
which
was
afterwards
called
manicheism
they
believed
in
a
good
and
in
a
wicked
god
who
governed
the
world
between
them
of
these
the
former
made
himself
threefold
because
three
is
a
perfect
number
and
they
adopted
into
their
religion
that
curious
metaphysical
opinion
that
everything
divine
is
formed
of
three
parts
and
accordingly
on
the
theban
monuments
we
often
see
the
gods
in
groups
of
three
they
worshipped
osiris
isis
and
horus
under
the
form
of
a
triangle
in
which
horus
was
the
side
opposite
to
the
right
angle
the
favourite
part
of
their
mythology
was
the
lamentation
of
isis
for
the
death
of
her
husband
osiris
by
another
change
the
god
horus
who
used
to
be
a
crowned
king
of
manly
stature
was
now
a
child
holding
a
finger
to
his
mouth
and
thereby
marking
that
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
talk
the
romans
who
did
not
understand
this
egyptian
symbol
for
youthfulness
thought
that
in
this
character
he
was
commanding
silence
and
they
gave
the
name
of
harpocrates
the
to
a
god
of
silence
horus
was
also
often
placed
as
a
child
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
isis
and
thus
by
the
loving
nature
of
the
group
were
awakened
the
more
tender
feelings
of
the
worshipper
the
egyptians
like
the
greeks
had
always
been
loud
in
declaring
that
they
were
beloved
by
their
gods
but
they
received
their
favours
with
little
gratitude
and
hardly
professed
that
they
felt
any
love
towards
the
gods
in
return
but
after
the
time
of
the
christian
era
we
meet
with
more
kindly
feelings
even
among
the
pagans
we
find
from
the
greek
names
of
persons
that
they
at
least
had
begun
to
think
their
gods
deserving
of
love
and
in
this
group
of
the
mother
and
child
such
a
favourite
also
in
christian
art
we
see
in
what
direction
these
more
kindly
feelings
found
an
entrance
into
the
egyptian
religion
as
fast
as
opinion
was
raising
the
great
god
serapis
above
his
fellows
and
making
the
wrathful
judge
into
the
ruler
of
the
world

fast

itself

earnestness

built
at

eagerness

of

long
the

prefects
kept
this

one

about
this
time
they
prophesied
the
of
the
jews
at
jerusalem
and
as
the
time
drew
near
all
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
were
disturbed
by
rebellious
risings
of
the
jews
moved
by
the
religious
enthusiasm
which
gave
birth
to
the
writings
the
jews
of
egypt
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
this
reign
were
again
roused
into
a
quarrel
with
their
greek
and
in
the
next
year
the
last
of
the
reign
they
rose
against
their
roman
governors
in
open
rebellion
and
they
were
not
put
down
till
the
prefect
lupus
had
brought
his
forces
against
them
after
this
the
jews
of
cyrene
marched
through
the
desert
into
egypt
under
the
command
of
lucuas
to
help
their
brethren
and
the
rebellion
took
the
regular
form
of
a
civil
war
with
all
its
usual
horrors
the
emperor
sent
against
the
jews
an
army
followed
by
a
fleet
which
after
numerous
skirmishes
and
battles
routed
them
with
great
slaughter
and
drove
numbers
of
them
back
into
the
desert
whence
they
harassed
the
village
as
robbers
by
these
unsuccessful
appeals
to
force
the
jews
lost
all
right
to
those
privileges
of
citizenship
which
they
always
claimed
and
which
had
been
granted
by
the
emperors
though
usually
refused
by
the
alexandrians
the
despair
and
disappointment
of
the
jews
seem
in
many
cases
to
have
turned
their
minds
to
the
christian
view
of
the
old
testament
prophecies
henceforth
says
eusebius
the
jews
embraced
the
christian
religion
more
readily
and
in
greater
numbers
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
hadrian
egypt
was
honoured
by
a
visit
from
the
emperor
he
was
led
to
egypt
at
that
time
by
some
riots
of
a
character
more
serious
than
usual
which
had
arisen
between
two
cities
probably
memphis
and
heliopolis
about
a
bull
as
to
whether
it
was
to
be
apis
or
mnevis
egypt
had
been
for
some
years
without
a
sacred
bull
and
when
at
length
the
priests
found
one
marked
with
the
mystic
spots
the
inhabitants
of
those
two
cities
flew
to
arms
and
the
peace
of
the
province
was
disturbed
by
their
religious
zeal
each
claiming
the
bull
as
their
own
hadrian
also
undertook
a
voyage
up
the
nile
from
alexandria
in
order
to
explore
the
wonders
of
egypt
this
was
the
fashion
then
for
the
ancient
monuments
and
the
banks
of
this
mysterious
river
offered
just
as
many
attractions
at
that
time
as
they
have
done
to
all
nations
since
the
expedition
of
napoleon
that
which
had
remained
unchanged
for
centuries
a
riddle
of
human
religion
was
bound
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
strangers
in
this
divinisation
of
animals
lay
the
greatest
contempt
for
human
understanding
and
it
was
a
bitter
satire
on
the
apotheosis
of
kings
and
emperors
for
what
was
the
divinity
of
sesostris
of
alexander
of
augustus
or
hadrian
compared
with
the
heavenly
majesty
of
the
ox
apis
or
the
holy
cats
dogs
kites
crocodiles
and
egypt
was
at
this
epoch
already
a
museum
of
the
and
its
enbalamed
culture
strange
buildings
rare
sculptures
hieroglyphics
and
pictures
still
filled
the
ancient
towns
even
though
these
had
lost
their
splendour
memphis
and
heliopolis
bubastis
abydos
saïs
tanis
and
the
thebes
had
long
fallen
into
ruin
although
still
inhabited
the
escort
must
have
been
an
extraordinary
sight
as
it
steered
up
the
stream
on
a
fleet
of
dahabiehs
the
emperor
was
accompanied
by
students
of
the
museum
interpreters
priests
and
astrologers
amongst
his
followers
were
verus
and
the
beautiful
antinous
the
empress
sabina
also
accompanied
him
she
had
the
poetess
julia
balbilla
amongst
her
court
ladies
they
landed
wherever
there
was
anything
of
interest
to
be
seen
and
there
was
more
in
those
days
than
there
is
now
they
admired
the
great
pyramids
the
colossal
sphinx
and
the
sacred
town
of
memphis
this
city
the
ancient
royal
seat
of
the
pharaohs
and
even
in
time
the
second
town
in
egypt
was
not
yet
buried
under
the
sand
of
the
desert
its
disappearance
had
however
already
begun
under
the
ptolemies
it
had
given
much
of
the
material
of
her
temples
and
palaces
for
the
building
of
alexandria
the
great
palace
of
the
pharaohs
had
long
been
destroyed
but
there
still
remained
many
notable
monuments
such
as
the
temple
of
phtah
the
pyramids
the
necropolis
and
the
serapeum
and
they
retained
their
ancient
cult
the
town
was
still
the
chief
seat
of
the
egyptian
hierarchy
and
the
residence
of
apis
for
this
very
reason
the
roman
government
had
destined
it
to
be
one
of
her
strong
military
stations
for
here
a
legion
was
quartered
the
emperor
could
walk
through
the
avenues
of
sphinxes
which
led
to
the
wonderful
vaults
where
the
long
succession
of
divine
animals
was
buried
each
like
a
pharaoh
in
a
magnificent
granite
sarcophagus
hadrian
could
admire
the
beautifully
sculptured
tomb
of
di
an
egyptian
officer
of
the
fifth
dynasty
with
less
trouble
than
we
must
experience
now
for
now
the
palaces
the
pictures
of
the
gods
and
almost
all
the
pyramids
are
swallowed
up
in
sand
miserable
arab

such
as
saqqâra
have
fixed
themselves
in
the
ruins

from
a
thick

can
look
with
astonishment
upon
the
torso
of
the

solitary

last
witness
to
the
glory
of

its
stand

heliopolis

town

a
school

supposed
to
have

centuries
erected

so
many
of

monuments
as
here
and
in

saw
many
of
them
lying
on

just
as
strabo
had
done
on
the

of

now
green
with
only
a

is
considered
as
the
oldest
of

the

assemblage

arrived
in
the
course
of
their
journey
at
besa
a
place
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
opposite
hermopolis
when
a
strange
event
occurred
this
was
the
death
of
favourite
antinous
a
young
greek
from
claudiopolis
who
had
been
degraded
to
the
position
of
ganymede
to
the
emperor
on
account
of
his
beauty
it
is
not
known
where
the
emperor
first
came
across
the
youth
possibly
in
his
native
land
bithynia
not
till
he
came
to
egypt
did
he
become
his
inseparable
companion
and
this
must
have
been
a
deep
offence
to
his
wife
the
unfortunate
queen
was
delivered
in
besa
from
his
hated
presence
for
antinous
was
drowned
there
in
the
nile
his
death
was
surrounded
by
mystery
was
it
accident
was
he
a
victim
humanity
protects
him
from
the
suspicion
that
he
sacrificed
his
victim
in
cold
blood
as
tiberius
had
once
sacrificed
the
beautiful
hypatus
in
capri
had
the
fantastic
youth
sacrificed
himself
of
his
own
free
will
to
the
death
divinities
in
order
to
save
the
life
had
the
egyptian
priests
foreseen
in
the
stars
some
danger
threatening
hadrian
only
to
be
averted
by
the
death
of
his
favourite
such
an
idea
commended
itself
to
the
superstition
of
the
time
especially
in
this
land
and
by
the
mysterious
nile
it
corresponded
too
with
the
astrological
arts
was
antinous
certain
when
he
plunged
into
the
waves
of
the
nile
that
he
would
arise
from
them
as
a
god
hadrian
asserts
in
his
memoirs
that
it
was
an
accident
but
no
one
believed
him
the
divine
honours
which
he
paid
to
the
dead
youth
lead
us
to
suppose
that
they
formed
the
reward
of
a
which
according
to
the
custom
of
those
times
constituted
a
highly
moral
action
and
was
looked
upon
as
heroic
devotion
at
any
rate
we
will
assume
that
this
sacrifice
sank
into
the
nile
without
will
hadrian
mourned
for
antinous
with
unspeakable
pain
and
now
he
was
achilles
by
the
corpse
of
patroklus
or
alexander
by
the
pyre
of
the
dead
hephaistus
he
had
the
youth
splendidly
buried
in
besa
this
most
extraordinary
intermezzo
of
all
nile
journeys
supplied
dying
heathendom
with
a
new
god
and
art
with
its
last
ideal
form
probably
also
during
the
burial
courtiers
already
saw
the
star
of
antinous
shining
in
midnight
sky
and
then
hadrian
saw
it
himself
in
the
mystical
land
of
egypt

might
still
be
poetical
even
in
the
clear
daylight
of
roman
universal
history
in
the
reign
of
hadrian
the
death
of
the
young
bithynian
seems
to
have
occurred
in
october
the
emperor
continued
his
journey
as
soon
as
he
had
given
orders
for
a
splendid
town
to
be
erected
on
the
site
of
besa
in
honour
of
his
friend
in
november
the
royal
company

to
be
found
amongst
the
ruins
of

thebes
the
oldest
town
in

had
been
first
put
in
the
shade
by

and
then
destroyed
by
cambyses
since
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
it
had
been
called
diospolis
and
ptolemais
had
taken
its
place
as
capital
of

in

it
was
split
up

formed
on
either
side
of
the

the

the

still
have
been
in

repair
these
pylons

these
splendid

with
their

appear
even
to
have
influenced
the
roman

in
the
time
of
the
emperors
their
reflex
influence
has
been
even
seen
in

in
which
the
chief
thing
was
the
tomb
in
alexandria
the
emperor
mixed
freely
with
the
professors
of
the
museum
asking
them
questions
and
answering
theirs
in
return
and
he
dropped
his
tear
of
pity
on
the
tomb
of
the
great
pompey
in
the
form
of
a
greek
epigram
though
with
very
little
point
he
laid
out
large
sums
of
money
in
building
and
ornamenting
the
city
and
the
alexandrians
were
much
pleased
with
his
behaviour
among
other
honours
that
they
paid
him
they
changed
the
name
of
the
month
december
calling
it
the
month
hadrian
but
as
they
were
not
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
empire
the
name
soon
went
out
of
use
the
patronage
of
philosophy
was
rather
at
the
cost
of
the
alexandrian
museum
for
he
enrolled
among
its
paid
professors
men
who
were
teaching
from
school
to
school

of

for

whenever
he
chose
to

and

pancrates
the
alexandrian
poet
gained
his
salary
in
the
museum
by
the
easy
task
of
a
little
flattery
on
return
to
alexandria
from
the
thebaid
the
poet
presented
to
him
a
lotus
a
flower
well
known
in
india
though
less
common
in
egypt
than
either
the
blue
or
white
lotus
and
assured
him
that
it
had
sprung
out
of
the
blood
of
the
lion
slain
by
his
royal
javelin
at
a
in
libya

lotus
the
emperor
was
pleased
with
the
compliment
and
gave
him
a
place
in
the
museum
and
pancrates
in
return
named
the
plant
the
lotus
of
antinous
pancrates
was
a
warm
admirer
of
the
mystical
opinions
of
the
egyptians
which
were
then
coming
into
note
in
alexandria
he
was
said
to
have
lived
underground
in
holy
solitude
or
converse
with
the
gods
for
years
and
during
that
time
to
have
been
taught
magic
by
the
goddess
isis
and
thus
to
have
gained
the
power
of
working
miracles
he
learned
to
call
upon
the
queen
of
darkness
by
her
egyptian
name
hecate
and
when
driving
out
evil
spirits
to
speak
to
them
in
the
egyptian
language
whether
these
greek
students
of
the
eastern
mysticism
were
deceivers
or
deceived
whether
they
were
led
by
a
love
of
notoriety
or
of
knowledge
is
in
most
cases
doubtful
but
they
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
credulous
admirers
who
formed
a
strange
contrast
with
the
sceptics
and
critics
of
the
museum
among
the
alexandrian
grammarians
of
this
reign
was
apollonius
dyscolus
so
called
perhaps
from
a
moroseness
of
manner
who
wrote
largely
on
rhetoric
on
the
greek
dialects
on
accents
prosody
and
on
other
branches
of
grammar
in
the
few
pages
that
remain
of
his
numerous
writings
we
trace
the
love
of
the
marvellous
which
was
then
growing
among
some
of
the
philosophers
he
tells
us
many
remarkable
stories
which
he
collected
rather
as
a
judicious
inquirer
than
as
a
credulous
believer
such
as
of
second
sight
an
account
of
a
lad
who
fell
asleep
in
the
field
while
watching
his
sheep
and
then
slept
for
years
and
awoke
to
wonder
at
the
strangeness
of
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
the
meanwhile
and
of
a
man
who
after
death
used
from
time
to
time
to
leave
his
body
and
wander
over
the
earth
as
a
spirit
till
his
wife
tired
of
his
coming
back
again
so
often
put
a
stop
to
it
by
having
his
mummy
burnt
he
gives
us
for
the
first
time
eastern
tales
in
a
greek
dress
and
we
thus
learn
the
source
from
which
europe
gained
much
of
its
literature
in
the
middle
ages
the
alexandrian
author
of
greatest
note
at
this
time
was
the
historian
appian
who
tells
us
that
he
had
spent
some
years
in
rome
practising
as
a
lawyer
and
returned
to
egypt
on
being
appointed
to
a
high
post
in
the
government
of
his
native
city
there
he
wrote
his
roman
history
in
this
reign
the
jews
forgetful
of
what
they
had
just
suffered
under
trajan
again
rose
against
the
power
of
rome
and
when
judæa
rebelled
against
its
prefect
tinnius
rufus
a
little
army
of
jews
marched
out
of
egypt
and
libya
to
help
their
brethren
and
to
free
the
holy
land
but
they
were
everywhere
routed

the
statue

covered
with
names
and
inscriptions
in
prose
and
verse
of
travellers
who
had
visited
it
at
sunrise
during
the
reigns
of
hadrian
and
the
antonines
from
these
curious
memorials
we
learn
that
hadrian
visited
thebes
a
second
time
with
his
queen
sabina
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
his
reign
when
the
empress
first
visited
the
statue
she
was
disappointed
at
not
hearing
the
musical
sounds
but
on
her
hinting
threats
of
the
displeasure
her
curiosity
was
gratified
on
the
following
morning
this
gigantic
statue
of
hard
gritstone
had
formerly
been
broken
in
half
across
the
waist
and
the
upper
part
thrown
to
the
ground
either
by
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
or
the
ruder
shock
of
persian
zeal
against
the
egyptian
religion
and
for
some
centuries
past
the
musical
notes
had
issued
from
the
broken
fragments
such
was
its
fallen
state
when
the
empress
sabina
saw
it
and
when
strabo
and
juvenal
and
pausanias
listened
to
its
sounds
and
it
was
not
till
after
the
reign
of
hadrian
that
it
was
again
raised
upright
like
its
companion
as
travellers
now

it

the
slumber
song
from
the
painting
by
grot
johann
from
this
second
visit
and
a
longer
acquaintance
hadrian
seems
to
have
formed
a
very
poor
opinion
of
the
egyptians
and
egyptian
jews
and
the
following
curious
letter
written
in
to
his
friend
servianus
throws
much
light
upon
their
religion
as
worshippers
of
serapis
at
the
same
time
that
it
proves
how
numerous
the
christians
had
become
in
alexandria
even
within
seventy
years
of
the
period
during
which
the
evangelist

is
believed
to
have
preached
there

to
servianus
the
consul
greeting
for
egypt
which
you
were
praising
to
me
dearest
servianus
i
have
found
its
people
wholly
light
wavering
and
flying
after
every
breath
of
a
report
those
who
worship
serapis
are
christians
and
those
who
call
themselves
bishops
of
christ
are
devoted
to
serapis
there
is
no
ruler
of
a
jewish
synagogue
no
samaritan
no
presbyter
of
the
christians
who
is
not
a
mathematician
an
augur
and
a
soothsayer
the
very
patriarch
himself
when
he
came
into
egypt
was
by
some
said
to
worship
serapis
and
by
others
to
worship
christ
as
a
race
of
men
they
are
seditious
vain
and
spiteful
as
a
body
wealthy

prosperous

whom
nobody
lives
in

others

lost
the
use

not
live
in
idleness
their
one
god

nothing

have
granted
everything
unto
them
i
have
restored
their
old
privileges
and
have
made
them
grateful
by
adding
new
among
the
crowd
of
gods
that
had
formerly
been
worshipped
in
egypt
serapis
had
latterly
been
rising
above
the
rest
he
was
the
god
of
the
dead
who
in
the
next
world
was
to
reward
the
good
and
punish
the
wicked
and
in
the
growing
worship
of
this
one
judge
we
can
not
but
trace
the
downfall
of
some
of
the
evils
of
polytheism
a
plurality
in
unity
was
another
method
now
used
to
explain
away
the
polytheism

hence
arose
the
opinion

to
have
been
given
to
hadrian
that
the
egyptians
had
only
one
god
and
his
mistake
in
thinking
that
the
worshippers
of
serapis
were
christians
the
emperor
indeed
himself
though
a
polytheist
was
very
little
of
an
idolater
for
though
he
wished
to
add
christ
to
the
number
of
the
roman
gods
he
on
the
other
hand
ordered
that
the
temples
built
in
his
reign
should
have
no
images
for
worship
and
in
after
ages
it
was
common
to
call
all
temples
without
statues
temples
but
there
were
other
and
stronger
reasons
for
classing
the
christians
with
the
egyptian
astrologers
a
christian
heresy
was
then
rising
into
notice
in
egypt
in
that
very
form
taking
its
opinions
from
the
philosophy
on
which
it
was
engrafted
before
christianity
was
preached
in
alexandria
there
were
already
three
religions
or
forms
of
philosophy
belonging
to
the
three
races
of
men
who
peopled
that
busy
city
first
the
greek
philosophy
which
was
chiefly
platonism
secondly
the
mysticism
of
the
egyptians
and
lastly
the
religion
of
the
jews
these
were
often
more
or
less
mixed
as
we
see
them
all
united
in
the
works
of
and
in
the
writings
of
the
early
converts
we
usually
find
christianity
clothed
in
one
or
other
of
these
forms
according
to
the
opinions
held
by
the
writers
before
their
conversion
the
first
christian
teachers
the
apostolic
fathers
as
they
are
called
because
they
had
been
hearers
of
the
apostles
themselves
were
mostly
jews
but
among
the
egyptians
and
greeks
of
alexandria
their
religion
lost
much
of
its
purely
moral
caste
and
became
with
the
former
an
astrological
mysticism
and
with
the
latter
an
abstract
speculative
theology
it
is
of
the
egyptian
jews
that
hadrian
speaks
in
his
letter
just
quoted
many
of
them
had
been
already
converted
to
christianity
and
their
religion
had
taken
the
form
of
gnosticism
gnosticism
or
science
for
the
name
means
no
more
was
not
then
new
in
alexandria
nor
were
its
followers
originally
christians
it
was
the
proud
name
claimed
for
their
opinions
by
those
who
studied
the
eastern
philosophy
of
the
magi
and
egypt
seems
to
have
been
as
much
its
native
soil
as
india
the
name
of
gnostic
says
weber
was
generally
given
to
those
who
distinguished
between
belief
on
authority
and
gnosis
between
the
ordinary
comprehension
and
a
higher
knowledge
only
granted
to
a
few
gifted
or
chosen
ones
they
were
split
up
into
different
sects
according
as
they
approached
more
nearly
the
eastern
theosophy
or
the
platonic
philosophy
but
in
general
the
eastern
conception
with
its
symbols
and
unlimited
fantasy
remained
dominant
the
of
those
who
never
reached
actual
monotheism
the
conception
of
one
personal
god
who
created
everything
according
to
his
own
free
will
and
rules
over
everything
with
unlimited
wisdom
and
love
the
god
of
the
gnostics
is
a
dark
mysterious
being
which
can
only
arrive
at
a
consciousness
of
itself
through
a
manifold
descending
scale
of
forces
which
flow
from
the
god
himself
the
visible
world
was
created
out
of
dead
and
evil
matter
by
demiurgos
the
divine
a
production
and
subordinate
of
the
highest
god
man
too
is
a
production
of
this
subordinate
creator
a
production
subject
to
a
blind
fate
and
a
prey
to
those
powers
which
rule
between
heaven
and
earth
without
the
only
thing
which
makes
the
ideas
of
sin
and
responsibility
possible
matter
is
the
seat
of
evil
and
as
long
as
man
stands
under
the
influence
of
this
matter
he
is
in
the
hands
of
evil
and
knows
no
freedom
redemption
can
only
reach
him
through
those
higher
beings
of
light
which
free
man
from
the
power
of
matter
and
translate
him
into
the
kingdom
of
light
according
to
the
gnostic
teaching
christ
is
one
of
these
beings
of
light
he
is
one
of
the
highest
who
appeared
on
earth
and
is
transformed
into
a
mythical
allegorical
being
with
his
human
nature
his
sufferings
and
death
completely
suppressed
the
redeemed
soul
is
then
as
a
kind
of
angel
or
ideal
being
brought
in
triumph
into
the
idealistic
realm
of
light
as
soon
as
it
has
purified
itself
to
the
nature
of
a
spirit
by
means
of
penitence
chastisements
and
finally
the
death
of
the
physical
body
hence
the
gnostics
attached
little
importance
to
the
means
of
mercy
in
the
church
to
the
bible
or
the
sacraments
they
allowed
the
church
teaching
to
exist
as
a
necessary
conception
for
the
people
but
they
placed
their
own
teachings
far
above
it
as
mysterious
or
secret
teachings
as
regards
their
morals
and
mode
of
life
the
gnostics
generally
went
to
extremes
it
was
due
to
gnosticism
that
art
and
science
found
an
entrance
into
the
church
it
preserved
the
church
from
becoming
stereotyped
in
form
but
built
up
entirely
on
ideas
and
not
on
historical
facts
it
died
from
its
own
hollowness
and
eccentricity
we
still
possess
the
traces
of
the
gnostic
astrology
in
a
number
of
amulets
and
engraved
gems
with
the
word
or
rather
and
other
emblems
of
their
superstition
which
they
kept
as
charms
against
diseases
and
evil
spirits
the
word
may
be
translated
me
to
their
mystic
rites
we
may
trace
many
of
the
reproaches
thrown
upon
christianity
such
as
that
the
christians
worshipped
the
head
of
an
ass
using
the
koptic
name
to
represent
the
name
of
ian
or
jahveh
to
the
same
source
we
may
also
trace
some
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
christian
fathers
such
as
ambrose
calling
jesus
good
scarabæus
who
rolled
up
before
him
the
hitherto
mud
of
our
bodies
a
thought
which
seems
to
have
been
borrowed
as
much
from
the
hieroglyphics
as
from
the
habits
and
perhaps
from
the
egyptian
priests
in
some
cases
using
the
scarabous
to
denote
the
god
and
sometimes
the
word
we
trace
this
thought
on
the
gnostic
gems
where
ave
see
a
winged
griffin
rolling
before
him
a
wheel
the
emblem
of
eternity
he
sits
like
a
conqueror
on
horseback
trampling
under
foot
the
serpent
of
old
the
spirit
of
sin
and
death
his
horse
is
in
the
form
of
a
ram
with
an
head
and
the
crowned
asp
or
basilisk
for
its
tail
before
him
stands
the
figure
of
victory
giving
him
a
crown
above
are
written
the
words
alpha
and
omega
and
below
perhaps
the
word
iah
jahveh
so
far
we
have
seen
the
form
which
christianity
at
first
took
among
the
egyptians
but
as
few
writings
by
these
gnostics
have
come
down
to
our
time
we
chiefly
know
their
opinions
from
the
reproaches
of
their
enemies
it
was
not
till
the
second
generation
of
gnostic
teachers
were
spreading
their
heresies
that
the
greek
philosophers
began
to
embrace
christianity
or
the
christians
to
study
greek
literature
but
as
soon
as
that
was
the
case
we
have
an
unbroken
chain
of
writings
in
which
we
find
christianity
more
or
less
mixed
with
the
alexandrian
form
of
platonism
illustration
koptic

scarabeus
the
philosopher
justin
after
those
who
had
talked
with
the
apostles
is
the
earliest
christian
writer
whose
works
have
reached
us
he
was
a
greek
born
in
samaria
but
he
studied
many
years
in
alexandria
under
philosophers
of
all
opinions
he
did
not
however
at
once
find
in
the
schools
the
wisdom
he
was
in
search
for
the
stoic
could
teach
him
nothing
about

the
peripatetic
wished
to
be
paid
for
his
lessons
before
he
gave
them
and
the
pythagorean
proposed
to
begin
with
music
and

illustration
gnostic
gem
not
content
with
these
justin
turned
to
the
platonist
whose
purer
philosophy
seemed
to
add
wings
to
his
thoughts
and
taught
him
to
mount
aloft
towards
true
wisdom
while
turning
over
in
his
mind
what
he
had
thus
learned
in
the
several
schools
dissatisfied
with
the
views
he
chanced
one
day
to
meet
with
an
old
man
walking
on
the
seashore
near
alexandria
to
whom
he
unbosomed
his
thoughts
and
by
whom
he
was
converted
to
christianity
justin
tells
us
that
there
were
no
people
whether
greeks
or
barbarians
or
even
dwellers
in
tent
and
waggons
among
whom
prayers
were
not
offered
up
to
the
heavenly
father
in
the
name
of
the
crucified
jesus
the
christians
met
every
sunday
for
public
worship
which
began
with
a
reading
from
the
prophets
or
from
the
memoirs
of
the
apostles
called
the
gospels
this
was
followed
by
a
sermon
a
prayer
the
bread
and
wine
and
a
second
prayer

that
he
is
speaking
of
the
new
testament

within
a
hundred
years
of
the
crucifixion
wras
read
in
all
the
principal
cities

which
greek
was
spoken
justin
died
as
a
martyr
in
the
platonic
professorship
in
alexandria

usually
been
held
by
an
athenian

for
a
short
time
athenagoras
of
athens
taught
that
branch
of
philosophy
in
the
museum
but
he
afterwards
embraced
the
christian
religion
and
then
taught
christianity
openly
in
alexandria
he
enjoys
with
justin
the
honour
of
being
one
of
the
first
men

learning

were
converted

must
have
been
always
moving

four

no
satisfactory
reckoning
of
the
years
had
been
kept

as
the

known

observation

was
some

said
the

thus
left

in
a

we
know
from
the
zodiac
in
the
memnonium
at
thebes
was
meant
for
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
in
the
second
and
in
the
sixth
year

find
on
the
coins
the
remarkable
word
aion
or
and
an
ibis
with
a
glory
of
rays
round
its
head
meant
for
the
bird
phoenix
in
the
seventh
year
we
see
orpheus
playing
on
his
lyre
while
all
the
animals
of
the
forest
are
listening
thus
pointing
out
the
return
of
the
golden
age
in
the
eighth
year
we
have
the
head
of
serapis
circled
by
the
seven
planets
and
the
whole
within
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
on
another
coin
we
have
the
sun
and
moon
within
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
a
series
of
twelve
coins
for
the
same
year
tells
us
that
the
house
of
the
sun
in
the
language
of
the
astrologers
is
in
the
lion
that
of
the
moon
in
the
crab
the
houses
of
venus
in
the
scales
and
the
bull
those
of
mars
in
the
scorpion
and
the
ram
those
of
jupiter
in
the
archer
and
the
fishes
those
of
saturn
in
the
and
aquarius
those
of
mercury
in
the
virgin
and
the
twins
on
the
coins
of
the
same
year
we
have
the
eagle
and
thunderbolt
the
sphinx
the
bull
apis
the
nile
and
crocodile
isis
nursing
the
child
horus
the
aroëris
and
the
winged
sun
on
coins
of
other
years
we
have
a
camelopard
horus
sitting
on
the
and
a
sacrifice
to
isis
which
was
celebrated
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
coins
also
tell
us
of
the
bountiful
overflow
of
the
nile
and
of
the
goodness
of
the
harvests
that
followed
thus
in
the
ninth
tenth
thirteenth
and
seventeenth
years
we
see
the
river
nile
in
the
form
of
an
old
man
leaning
on
a
crocodile
pouring
corn
and
fruit
out
of
a
cornucopia
while
a
child
by
his
side
with
the
figures
tells
us
that
in
those
years
the
waters
of
the
nile
rose
at
memphis
to
the
height
of
sixteen
cubits
from
these
latter
coins
it
would
seem
that
but
little
change
had
taken
place
in
the
soil
of
the
delta
by
the
yearly
deposit
of
mud
herodotus
says
that
sixteen
cubits
was
the
rise
of
the
nile
at
memphis
when
he
was
there
and
we
should
almost
think
that
the
seasons
were
more
favourable
to
the
husbandman
during
the
reign
of
an
antonine
than
of
a
caligula
did
we
not
set
it
down
to
the
canals
being
better
cleansed
by
the
care
of
the
prefect
and
to
the
mildness
of
the
government
leaving
the
people
at
liberty
to
enjoy
the
bounties
of
nature
and
at
the
same
time
making
them
more
grateful
in
acknowledging
them
illustration
coins
of
antoninus
pius
the
mystic
emblems
on
the
coins
are
only
what
we
might
look
for
from
the
spread
of
the
gnostic
opinions
and
the
eagerness
with
which
the
greeks
were
copying
the
superstitions
of
the
egyptians
and
while
astrology
was
thus
countenanced
by
the
state
of
course
it
was
not
less
followed
by
the
people
the
poor
jews
took
to
it
as
a
trade

alexandria

half
beggar

stop
people
in
the
streets
and
interpret
dreams
by
the
help
of
the

or
sit
under
a
sacred
tree
like
a
sibyl
and
promise
wealth
to
those
who
consulted
her
duly
proportioned
to
the
size
of
the
coin
by
which
she
was
paid
we
find
among
the
theban
ruins
pieces
of
papyrus
with
inscriptions
describing
the
positions
of
the
heavens
at
particular
hours
in
this
reign

the
astrologers
therewith
to
calculate
the
nativities
of
the
persons

born

a
complete
horoscope
containing
the
places
of
the
sun
moon
and
every
planet
noted
down
on
the
zodiac
in
degrees
and
minutes
of
a
degree
and
with
these
particulars
the
mathematician
undertook
to
foretell
the
marriage
fortune
and
death
of
the
person
who
had
been
born
at
the
instant
when
the
heavenly
bodies
were
so
situated
and
as
the
horoscope
was
buried
in
the
tomb
with
the
mummy
we
must
suppose
that
it
was
thought
that
the
prognostication
would
hold
good
even
in
the
next
world
but
astrology
was
not
the
only
end
to
which
mathematics
were
then
turned
claudius
ptolemy
the
astronomer
and
geographer
was
at
that
time
the
ornament
of
the
mathematical
school
of
alexandria
in
his
writings
he
treats
of
the
earth
as
the
centre
of
the
heavens
and
the
sun
moon
and
planets
as
moving
in
circles
and
epicycles
round
it
this
had
been
the
opinion
of
some
of
the
early
astronomers
but
since
this
theory
of
the
heavens
received
the
stamp
of
his
authority
it
is
now
always
called
the
ptolemaic
system
in
this
reign
was
made
a
new
survey
of
all
the
military
roads
in
the
roman
empire
called
the
of
it
included
the
great
roads
of
egypt
which
were
only
six
in
number
one
was
from
in
nubia
along
the
east
bank
of
the
nile
to
babylon
opposite
memphis
and
there
turning
eastward
through
heliopolis
and
the
district
of
the
jews
to
clysmon
where
canal
entered
the
red
sea
a
second
from
memphis
to
pelusium
made
use
of
this
for
about
thirty
miles
joining
it
at
babylon
and
leaving
it
at
scense
veteranorum
by
these
two
roads
a
traveller
could
go
from
pelusium
to
the
head
of
the
red
sea
but
there
was
a
shorter
road
through
the
desert
which
joined
the
first
at
serapion
about
fifty
miles
from
clysmon
instead
of
at
sceno
veteranorum
which
was
therefore
about
a
hundred
miles
shorter
a
fourth
was
along
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
from
hiera
sycaminon
in
nubia
to
alexandria
leaving
the
river
at
andropolis
about
sixty
miles
from
the
latter
city
a
fifth
was
from
palestine
to
alexandria
running
along
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
from
raphia
to
pelusium
and
thence
leaving
the
coast
to
avoid
the
flat
country
which
was
under
water
during
the
inundation
it
joined
the
last
at
andropolis
the
sixth
road
was
from
koptos
on
the
nile
to
berenicê
on
the
red
sea
these
six
were
probably
the
only
roads
under
the
care
of
the
prefect
though
syênê
was
the
boundary
of
the
province
of
egypt
the
roman
power
was
felt
for
about
one
hundred
miles
into
nubia
and
we
find
the
names
of
the
emperors
on
several
temples
between
syênê
and
hiera
sycaminon
but
beyond
this
though
we
find
inscriptions
left
by
roman
travellers
the
emperors
seem
never
to
have
aimed
at
making
military
roads
or
holding
any
cities
against
the
inroads
of
the
blemmyes
and
other
arabs
to
this
survey
we
must
add
the
valuable
geographical
knowledge
given
by
arrian
in
his
voyage
round
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
which
has
come
down
to
us
in
an
interesting
document
wherein
he
mentions
the
several
seaports
and
their
distances
with
the
tribes
and
cities
near
the
coast
the
trade
of
egypt
to
india
ethiopia
and
arabia
was
then
most
valuable
and
carried
on
with
great
activity
but
as
the
merchandise
was
in
each
case
carried
only
for
short
distances
from
city
to
city
the
traveller
could
gain
but
little
knowledge
of
where
it
came
from
or
even
sometimes
of
where
it
was
going

cane
this
is
perhaps
the
earliest
mention
found
in
history
but
arrian
does
not
speak
of
the
as
then
new
nor
does
he
tell
us
where
it
was
grown
had
sugar
been
then
seen
for
the
first
time
he
would
certainly
have
said
so
it
must
have
been
an
article
well
known
in
the
indian
trade

passing
through
egypt
on
his
travels
or
while
living
there
and
holding
some
post
under
the
prefect
the
historian
arrian
has
left
us
his
name
and
a
few
lines
of
poetry
carved
on
the
foot
of
the
great
sphinx
near
the
pyramids
at
this
time

travellers
continued
to
carve
their
names

wonder

foot
of
the
musical
statue

in
the
deep
empty
tombs
of

these
inscriptions
are
full
of
curious
information
for
example
it
has
been
doubted
whether
the
roman
army
was
provided
with
medical
officers
their
writers
have
not
mentioned
them
but
part
of
the
second
legion
was
at
this
time
stationed
at
thebes
and
one
asclepiades
while
cutting
his
name
in
a
tomb
which
once
held
some
old
theban
has
cleared
up
the
doubt
for
us
by
saying
that
he
was
physician
to
the
second
legion
antoninus
made
a
hippodrome
or
for
the
amusement
of
the
citizens
of
alexandria

built
two
gates

the
gate

sun
and
the
gate

the
former
fronting
the

the
latter
fronting
the
lake
mareotis
and
joined
by
the
great
street
which
ran
across
the
whole
width
of
the
city
but
this
reign
was
not
wholly
without
trouble
there
was
a
rebellion
in
which
the
prefect
dinarchus
lost
his
life
and
for
which
the
alexandrians
were
severely
punished
by
the
emperor

coins
of
marcus

a
rich
variety
of
subjects
falling
not
far
short
of
those
of
the
last
reign

those

the
bountiful

acknowledged
by
the
figure
of
the
god
holding
a
cornucopia
and
a

sixteen
children
playing
round
him
it
had
been
not
unusual
in
hieroglyphical
writing
to
express
a
thought
by
means
of
a
figure
which
in
the
koptic
language
had
nearly
the
same
sound
and
we
have
seen
this
copied
on
the
coins
in
the
case
of
a
greek
word
when
the
bird
phoenix
was
used
for
the
phoenix
or
the
hieroglyphical

striking
instance
may
be
noticed
in

as
if
in
that
year
the
emperor
had
been
expected
in
alexandria
we
find
no
coins
in
the
eleventh
or
fourteenth
years
of
this
reign
which
makes
it
probable
that
it
was
in
the
eleventh
year
that
the
rebellion
of
the
native
soldiers
took
place
these
were
very
likely
arabs
who
had
been
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
the
legions
but
having
withdrawn
to
the
desert
they
now
harassed
the
towns
with
their
marauding
inroads
and
a
considerable
time
elapsed
before
they
were
wholly
put
down
by
avidius
cassius
at
the
head
of
the
legions
but
cassius
himself
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptations
which
always
beset
a
successful
general
and
after
this
victory
he
allowed
himself
to
be
declared
emperor
by
the
legions
of
egypt
and
this
seems
to
have
been
the
cause
of
no
coins
being
struck
in
alexandria
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
cassius
left
his
son
moecianus
in
alexandria
with
the
title
of
pretorian
prefect
while
he
himself
marched
into
syria
to
secure
that
province
there
the
legions
followed
the
example
of
their
brethren
in
egypt
and
the
syrians
were
glad
to
acknowledge
a
general
of
the
eastern
armies
as
their
sovereign
but
on
marcus
leading
an
army
into
syria
he
was
met
with
the
news
that
the
rebels
had
repented
and
had
put
cassius
to
death
and
he
then
moved
his
forces
towards
egypt
but
before
his
arrival
the
egyptian
legions
had
in
the
same
manner
put
moecianus
to
death
and
all
had
returned
to
their
allegiance
when
marcus
arrived
in
alexandria
the
citizens
were
agreeably
surprised
by
the
mildness
of
his
conduct
he
at
once
forgave
his
enemies
and
no
offenders
were
put
to
death
for
having
joined
in
the
rebellion
the
severest
punishment
even
to
the
children
of
cassius
was
banishment
from
the
province
but
without
restraint
and
with
the
forfeiture
of
less
than
half
their
patrimony
in
alexandria
the
emperor
laid
aside
the
severity
of
the
soldier
and
mingled
with
the
people
as
a
in
the
temples
and
public
places

with
the
professors
in
the
museum
he
was
a
philosopher

athens

this
time
alike

upon
alexandria
as
the
centre
of
the
learning
the
library
was
then
in
its
greatest
glory
the
readers
were
numerous
and
christianity
had
as
yet
raised
no
doubts
about
the
value
of
its
pagan
treasures
all
the
wisdom
of
greece
written
on
rolls
of
brittle
papyrus
or
tough
parchment
was
ranged
in
boxes
on
the
shelves
of
these
writings
the
few
that
have
been
saved
from
the
wreck
of
time
are
no
doubt
some
of
the
best
and
they
are
perhaps
enough
to
guide
our
less
simple
taste
towards
the
unornamented
grace
of
the
greek
model
but
we
often
fancy
those
treasures
most
valuable
that
are
beyond
our
reach
and
hence
when
we
run
over
the
names
of
the
authors
in
this
library
we
think
perhaps
too
much
of
those
which
are
now
missing
the
student
in
the
museum
could
have
read
the
lyric
poems
of
alcæus
and
stersichorus
which
in
matter
and
style
were
excellent
enough
to
be
judged
not
quite
so
good
as
homer
the
tender
lamentations
of
simonides
the
warm
breathings
of
sappho
the
tenth
muse
the
pithy
iambics
of
archilochus
full
of
noble
flights
and
brave
irregularities
the
comedies
of
menander
containing
every
kind
of
excellence
those
of
eupolis
and
cratinus
which
were
equal
to
aristophanes
the
histories
of
theopompus
which
in
the
speeches
were
as
good
as
thucydides
the
lively
agreeable
orations
of
hyperides
the
accuser
of
demosthenes
with
the
books
of
travels
chronologies
and
countless
others
of
less
merit
for

his

his
amusing
work

a
picture
of
society
in
alexandria

everything
frivolous
was
treated
as
grave
and
everything
serious
was
laughed

wit

into
scandal

at

cost

numerous
quotations

alexandria

it
was

be
repeated
than
on
the
banks

nile
nothing
could
be
lower
than
the
poetic
taste
in
alexandria

this
time
the
museum
was
giving
birth
to
a
race
of
poets
who
instead
of
bringing
forth
thoughts
out
of
their
own
minds
found
them
in
the
storehouse
of
the
memory
only
they
wrote
their
patchwork
poems
by
the
help
of
lines
which
they
picked
from
all
parts
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
and
so
put
together
as
to
make
them
tell
a
new
tale

called
themselves

author

at
that
time
secretary
to

prefect

this
philosopher
found
a
broad
mark
for
his
humour
in
the
religion
of
the
egyptians
their
worship
of
animals
and
their
love
of
magic
the
general
mourning
through
the
land
on
the
death
of
the
bull
apis
their
funeral
ceremonies
their
placing

mummies

pawning
a

a
brother

a
so
little
had
the
customs
changed
that
the
young
egyptians
of
high
birth
still
wore
their
long
hair
tied
in
one
lock
and
hanging
over
the
right
ear
as
we
see
on
the
theban
sculptures
fifteen
centuries
earlier
it
was
then
a
mark
of
royalty
but
had
since
been
adopted
by
many
families
of
high
rank
and
continues
to
be
used
even
in
the
twentieth
century
illustration
the
sign
of
nobility
before
the
end
of
this
reign
we
meet
with
a
strong
proof
of
the
spread
of
christianity
in
egypt
the
number
of
believers
made
it
necessary
for
the
bishop
of
alexandria
to
appoint
three
bishops
under
him
to
look
after
the
churches
in
three
other
cities
and
accordingly
demetrius
who
then
held
that
office
took
upon
himself
the
rank
if
not
the
name
of
patriarch
of
alexandria
a
second
proof
of
the
spread
of
christianity
is
the
pagan
philosophers
thinking
it
necessary
to
write
against
it
celsus
an
epicurean
of
alexandria
was
one
of
the
first
to
attack
it
origen
answered
the
several
arguments
of
celsus
with
skill
and
candour
he
challenges
his
readers
to
a
comparison
between
the
christians
and
pagans
in
point
of
morals
in
alexandria
or
in
any
other
city
he
argues
in
the
most
forcible
way
that
christianity
had
overcome
all
difficulties
and
had
spread
itself
far
and
wide
against
the
power
of
kings
and
emperors
and
he
says
that
nobody
but
a
christian
ever
died
a
martyr
to
the
truth
of
his
religion
he
makes
good
use
of
the
jewish
prophecies
but
he
brings
forward
no
proofs
in
support
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
history
they
were
not
wanted
as
celsus
and
the
pagans
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
call
it
into
question
another
proof
of
the
number
of
egyptian
christians
is
seen
in
the
literary
frauds
of
which
their
writers
were
guilty
most
likely
to
satisfy
the
minds
of
those
pagan
converts
that
they
had
already
made
rather
than
from
a
wish
to
make
new
believers
about
this
time
was
written
by
an
unknown
christian
author
a
poem
in
eight
books
named
the
which
must
not
be
mistaken
for
the
pagan
fragments
of
the
same
name
it
is
written
in
the
form
of
a
prophecy
in
the
style
used
by
the
gnostics
and
is
full
of
dark
sentences
and
hints
another
spurious
christian
work
of
about
the
same
time
is
the
or
the
of
bishop
of
rome
it
is
an
account
of
the
travels
of
the
apostle
peter
and
his
conversation
with
simon
magus
but
the
knowledge
of
the
egyptian
mythology
of
the
opinions
of
the
greek
philosophers
and
of
the
astrological
rules
by
which
fortunes
are
foretold
from
the
places
amply
prove
that
he
was
an
egyptian
or
an
alexandrian
no
name
ranked
higher
among
the
christians
than
that
of
clemens
romanus
and
this
is
only
one
out
of
several
cases
of
christian
authors
who
wished
to
give
weight
to
their
own
opinions
by
passing
them
upon
the
world
as
his
writings
marcus
aurelius
who
died
in
had
pardoned
the
children
of
the
rebel
general
avidius
cassius
but
commodus
began
his
reign
by
putting
them
to
death
and
while
thus
disregarding
the
example
and
advice
of
his
father
he
paid
his
memory
the
idle
compliment
of
continuing
his
series
of
dates
on
his
own
coins
but
the
egyptian
coinage
of
commodus
clearly
betrays
the
sad
change
that
was
gradually
taking
place
in
the
arts
of
the
country
we
no
longer
see
the
former
beauty
and
variety
of
subjects
and
the
silver
which
had
before
been
very
much
mixed
with
copper
was
under
commodus
hardly
to
be
known
from

commodus
was
very
partial
to
the
egyptian
superstitions
and
he
adopted
the
tonsure
and
had
his
head
shaven
like
a
priest
of
isis

he
might
more
properly

we
learn

little
of

state
of
the
country
now

then
a
traveller
after
measuring
the
pyramids
of
memphis

the
underground
tombs
of

might
venture
as
far
as

such
travellers
were
few
the
majority
of
those
who
made
this
journey
have
left
the
fact
on
record
the
celebrated
museum
which
had
held
the
vast
library
of
the
ptolemies
had
been
burnt
by
the
soldiers
of
julius
cæsar
in
one
of
their
battles
with
the
egyptian
army
in
the
streets
of
alexandria

the
loss
had
been
in
part
repaired

the
library
from
pergamus

temple
of
serapis
the
new
library
however
would
seem
to
have
been
placed
in
a
building
somewhat
separated
from
the
temple
as
when
the
temple
of
serapis
was
burnt
in
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
and
again
when
it
was
in
part
destroyed
by
fire
in
the
second
year
of
this
reign
we
hear
of
no
loss
of
books
and
two
hundred
years
later
the
library
of
the
serapium

is
said
had
risen
to
the
number
of
seven

a
favourite
with
pilots
of

small

rather
dreaded
the

mouth

temple

had
lately
been
built

dedicated
to
the
god

the
name

emperor

there
some
of
the
grosser
superstitions
of

polytheists
fled
before

spread
of
christianity

platonism

also
finished

were
carved

the
walls

hieroglyphics

those

the
ptolemies

had
been
built
commodus
may
perhaps
not
have
been
the
last
emperor
whose
name

praises
were
carved
in
hieroglyphics
but
all
the
great
buildings
in
the
thebaid
which
add
such
value
to
the
early
history
of
egypt
had
ceased
before
his
reign
other
buildings
of
a
less
lasting
form
were
no
doubt
being
built
such
as
the
greek
temples
at
antinoopolis
and
ptolemais
which
have
long
since
been
swept
away
but
the
egyptian
priests
with
their
gigantic
undertakings
their
noble
plan
of
working
for
after
ages
rather
than
for
themselves
were
nearly
ruined
and
we
find
no
ancient
building
now
standing
in
egypt
that
was
raised
after
the
time
of
the
dynasty

antonines
illustration
canopic
jars
but
the
poverty
of
the
egyptians
was
not
the
only
cause
why
they
built
no
more
temples
though
the
colossal
statue
of
amenhôthes
uttered
its
musical
notes
every
morning
at
sunrise
still
tuneful
amid
the
desolation
with
which
it
was
surrounded
and
the
nile
was
still
worshipped
at
midsummer
by
the
husbandman
to
secure
its
fertilising
overflow
nevertheless
the
religion
itself
for
which
the
temples
had
been
built
was
fast
giving
way
before
the
silent
spread
of
christianity
the
religion
of
the
egyptians
unlike
that
of
the
greeks
was
no
longer
upheld
by
the
magistrate
it
rested
solely
on
the
belief
of
its
followers
and
it
may
have
merged
into
christianity
the
faster
for
the
greater
number
of
truths
which
were
contained
in
it
than
in
the
paganism
of
other
nations
the
scanty
hieroglyphical
records
tell
us
little
of
thoughts
feelings
and
opinions
indeed
that
cumbersome
mode
of
writing
which
alone
was
used
in
religious
matters
was
little
fitted
for
anything
beyond
the
most
material
parts
of
their
mythology
hence
we
must
not
believe
that
the
egyptian
polytheism
was
quite
so
gross
as
would
appear
from
the
sculptures
and
indeed
we
there
learn
that
they
believed
even
at
the
earliest
times
in
a
resurrection
from
the
tomb
a
day
of
judgment
and
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
the
priests
made
a
great
boast
of
their
learning
and
philosophy
and
could
each
repeat
by
heart
those
books
of
thot
which
belonged
to
his
own
order

singer

walked
first
in
the
sacred
processions

meanings

which
they
explained

had
two
religions

for
the
many

one
for

for
the
crowds

the

was
made

attribute

deity
was
made

person

another

intellectual
for
the
learned
in
the
schools
and

colleges
even
if
we
were
not
told
we
could
have
no
doubt
but
the
main
point
of
secret
knowledge
among
the
learned
was
a
disbelief
in
those
very
doctrines

they
were
teaching
to
the
vulgar

they
now
explained

widowed
of

and
the
spread
of
christianity
among
the
egyptians
was
such
that
their
teachers
found
it
necessary
to
supply
them
with
a
life
of
jesus
written
in
their
own
language
that
they
might
the
more
readily
explain
to
them
his
claim
to
be
obeyed
and
the
nature
of
his
commands
the
gospel
according
to
the
egyptians
for
such
was
the
name
this
work
bore
has
long
since
been
lost
and
was
little
quoted
by
the
alexandrians
it
was
most
likely
a
translation
from
one
of
the
four
gospels
though
it
had
some
different
readings
suited
to
its
own
church
and
contained
some
praise
of
celibacy
not
found
in
the
new
testament
but
it
was
not
valued
by
the
greeks
and
was
lost
on
the
spread
of
the
koptic
translation
of
the
whole
new
testament
the
grave
serious
christians
of
upper
egypt
were
very
unlike
the
lively
alexandrians
but
though
the
difference
arose
from
peculiarities
of
national
character
it
was
only
spoken
of
as
a
difference
of
opinion
the
egyptians
formed
an
ascetic
sect
in
the
church
who
were
called
heretics
by
the
alexandrians
and
named
docetas
because
they
taught
that
the
saviour
was
a
god
and
did
not
really
suffer
on
the
cross
but
was
crucified
only
they
of
necessity
used
the
gospel
according
to
the
egyptians
which
is
quoted
by
cassianus
one
of
their
writers
many
of
them
renounced
marriage
with
the
other
pleasures
and
duties
of
social
life
and
placed
their
chief
virtue
in
painful
and
out
of
them
sprang
that
remarkable
class
of
hermits
monks
and
fathers
of
the
desert
who
in
a
few
centuries
covered
europe
with
monasteries
it
is
remarkable
that
the
translation
of
a
gospel
into
koptic
introduced
a
greek
alphabet
into
the
koptic
language
though
for
all
religious
purposes
the
scribes
continued
to
use
the
ancient
hieroglyphics
in
which
we
trace
the
first
steps
by
which
pictures
are
made
to
represent
words
and
syllables
rather
than
letters
yet
for
the
common
purposes
of
writing
they
had
long
since
made
use
of
the
or
common
hand
in
which
the
earlier
system
of
writing
is
improved
by
the
characters
representing
only
letters
though
sadly
too
numerous
for
each
to
have
a
fixed
and
force
but
as
the
hieroglyphics
were
also
always
used
for
carved
writing
on
all
subjects
and
the
common
hand
only
used
on
papyrus
with
a
reed
pen
the
latter
became
wholly
an
indistinct
running
hand
it
lost
that
beauty
and
regularity
which
the
hieroglyphics
like
the
greek
and
roman
characters
kept
by
being
carved
on
stone
and
hence
it
would
seem
arose
the
want
of
a
new
alphabet
for
the
new
testament
this
was
made
by
merely
adding
to
the
greek
alphabet
six
new
letters
borrowed
from
the
hieroglyphics
for
those
sounds
which
the
greeks
did
not
use
and
the
writing
was
then
written
from
left
to
right
like
a
european
language
instead
of
in
either
direction
according
to
the
skill
or
fancy
of
the
scribe
it
was
only
upon
the
ancient
hieroglyphics
thus
falling
into
disuse
that
the
greeks
of
alexandria
almost
for
the
first
time
had
the
curiosity
to
study
the
principles
on
which
they
were
written
clemens
alexandrinus
who
thought
no
branch
of
knowledge
unworthy
of
his
attention
gives
a
slight
account
of
them
nearly
agreeing
with
the
results
of
our
modern
discoveries
he
mentions
the
three
kinds
of
writing
first
the
secondly
the
which
is
nearly
the
same
but
written
with
a
pen
and
less
ornamental
than
the
carved
figures
and
thirdly
the
or
common
alphabetic
writing
he
then
divides
the
hieroglyphic
into
the
alphabetic
and
the
symbolic
and
lastly
he
divides
the
symbolic
characters
into
the
imitative
the
figurative
and
those
formed
like
riddles
as
instances
of
these
last
we
may
quote
for
the
first
the
three
zigzag
lines
which
by
simple
imitation
mean
for
the
second
the
oval
which
mean
name
because
names
were
written
within
ovals
and
for
the
third
a
cup
with
three
anvils
which
mean
of
battles
because
and
have
nearly
the
same
sound
and
and
have
nearly
the
same
sound
in
this
reign
pantonus
of
athens
a
stoic
philosopher
held
the
first
place
among
the
christians
of
alexandria
he
is
celebrated
for
uniting
the
study
of
heathen
learning
with
a
religious
zeal
which
led
him
to
preach
christianity
in
abyssinia
illustration
hieroglyphic
hieratic
and
demotic
writing
he
introduced
a
taste
for
philosophy
among
the
christians
and
though
athenagoras
rather
deserves
that
honour
he
was
called
the
founder
of
the
catechetical
school
which
gave
birth
to
the
series
of
learned
christian
writers
that
flourished
in
alexandria
for
the
next
century
to
have
been
a
learned
man
and
a
christian
and
to
have
encouraged
learning
among
the
catechists
in
his
schools
may
seem
deserving
of
no
great
praise
was
the
religion
of
jesus
to
spread
ignorance
and
darkness
over
the
world
but
we
must
remember
that
a
new
religion
can
not
be
introduced
without
some
danger
that
learning
and
science
may
get
forbidden
together
with
the
ancient
superstitions
which
had
been
taught
in
the
same
schools
we
shall
hereafter
see
that
in
the
quarrels
between
pagans
and
christians
and
again
between
the
several
sects
of
christians
learning
was
often
reproached
with
being
unfavourable
to
true
religion
and
then
it
will
be
granted
that
it
was
no
small
merit
to
have
founded
a
school
in
which
learning
and
christianity
went
hand
in
hand
for
nearly
two
centuries
pantænus
has
left
no
writings
of
his
own
and
is
best
known
through
his
pupil
or
clemens
he
is
said
to
have
brought
with
him
to
alexandria
from
the
jewish
christians
that
he
met
with
on
his
travels
a
copy
of
gospel
in
the
original
hebrew
a
work
now
unfortunately
lost
which
if
we
possessed
it
would
settle
for
us
the
disputed
point
whether
or
no
it
contained
all
that
now
bears
that
name
in
the
greek
translation
the
learned
industrious
and
pious
clemens
who
to
distinguish
him
from
clemens
of
rome
is
usually
called
clemens
alexandrinus
succeeded
pantænus
in
the
catechetical
school
and
was
at
the
same
time
a
voluminous
writer
he
was
in
his
philosophy
a
platonist
though
sometimes
called
of
the
eclectic
school
he
has
left
an
address
to
the
gentiles
a
treatise
on
christian
behaviour
called
pedagogus
and
eight
books
of
stromata
or
which
he
wrote
to
describe
the
perfect
christian
or
gnostic
to
furnish
the
believer
with
a
model
for
his
imitation
and
to
save
him
from
being
led
astray
by
the
sects
of
gnostics
so
by
his
advice
and
by
the
imitation
of
christ
the
christian
is
to
step
forward
from
faith
through
love
to
knowledge
from
being
a
slave
he
is
to
become
a
faithful
servant
and
then
a
son
he
is
to
become
at
last
a
god
walking
in
the
flesh
clemens
was
not
wholly
free
from
the
mysticism
which
was
the
chief
mark
of
the
gnostic
sect
he
thought
much
of
the
sacred
power
of
numbers
abraham
had
three
hundred
and
eighteen
servants
when
he
rescued
lot
which
when
written
in
greek
numerals
thus
iht
formed
the
sacred
sign
for
the
name
of
jesus
ten
was
a
perfect
number
and
is
that
of
the
commandments
given
to
moses
seven
was
a
glorious
number
and
there
are
seven
pleiades
seven
planets
seven
days
in
the
week
and
the
two
fishes
and
five
barley
loaves
with
which
the
multitude
were
miraculously
fed
together
make
the
number
of
years
of
plenty
in
egypt
under
joseph
clemens
also
quotes
several
lines
in
praise
of
the
seventh
day
which
he
says
were
from
homer
hesiod
and
callimachus
but
here
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
deceived
by
the
pious
fraud
of
some
zealous
jew
or
christian
as
no
such
lines
are
now
to
be
found
in
the
pagan
poets
during
the
reign
of
pertinax
which
lasted
only
three
months
we
find
no
trace
of
his
power
in
egypt
except
the
money
which
the
alexandrians
coined
in
his
name
it
seems
to
have
been
the
duty
of
the
prefect
of
the
mint
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
an
death
to
lose
no
time
in
issuing
coins
in
the
name
of
his
successor
it
was
one
of
the
means
to
proclaim
and
secure
the
allegiance
of
the
province
for
the
new
emperor
during
the
reign
of
commodus
pescennius
niger
had
been
at
the
head
of
the
legion
that
was
employed
in
upper
egypt
in
stopping
the
inroads
of
their
troublesome
neighbours
who
already
sometimes
bore
the
name
of
saracens
he
was
a
hardy
soldier
and
strict
in
his
discipline
while
he
shared
the
labours
of
the
field
and
of
the
camp
with
the
men
under
him
he
would
not
allow
them
the
use
of
wine
and
once
when
the
troops
that
guarded
the
frontier
at
syênê
aswan
sent
to
ask
for
it
he
bluntly
answered
have
got
the
nile
to
drink
and
can
not
possibly
want
once
when
a
cohort
had
been
routed
by
the
saracens
the
men
complained
that
they
could
not
fight
without
wine
but
he
would
not
relax
in
his
discipline
who
have
just
now
beaten
you
said
niger
nothing
but
he
gained
the
love
and
thanks
of
the
people
of
upper
egypt
by
thus
bridling
the
lawlessness
of
the
troops
and
they
gave
him
his
statue
cut
in
black
basalt
in
allusion
to
his
name
niger
this
statue
was
placed
in
his
roman
villa
illustration
a
native
of
aswan
but
on
the
death
of
pertinax
when
septimus
severus
declared
himself
emperor
in
pannonia
niger
who
was
then
in
the
province
of
syria
did
the
same
egypt
and
the
egyptian
legions
readily
and
heartily
joined
his
party
which
made
it
unnecessary
for
him
to
stay
in
that
part
of
the
empire
so
he
marched
upon
greece
thrace
and
macedonia
but
there
after
a
few
months
he
was
met
by
the
army
of
his
rival
who
also
sent
a
second
army
into
egypt
and
he
was
defeated
and
slain
at
cyzicus
in
mysia
after
having
been
acknowledged
as
emperor
in
egypt
and
syria
for
perhaps
a
year
and
a
few
months
illustration
painting
at
the
entrance
of
the
fifth
tomb
we
find
no
alexandrian
coins
of
niger
although
we
can
not
allow
a
shorter
space
of
time
to
his
reign
than
one
whole
year
together
with
a
few
months
of
the
preceding
and
following
years
within
that
time
severus
had
to
march
upon
rome
against
his
first
rival
julian
to
punish
the
praetorian
guards
and
afterwards
to
conquer
niger
after
the
death
of
his
rival
when
severus
was
the
undisputed
master
of
the
empire
and
was
no
longer
wanted
in
the
other
provinces
he
found
leisure
in
to
visit
egypt
and
like
other
travellers
he
examined
the
pyramids
of
memphis
and
the
temples
at
thebes
and
laughed
at
the
worship
of
serapis
and
the
egyptian
animals
his
visit
to
alexandria
wras
marked
by
many
new
laws
now
that
the
greeks
of
that
city
crushed
beneath
two
centuries
of
foreign
rule
had
lost
any
remains
of
courage
or
of
pride
that
could
make
them
feared
by
their
roman
master
he
relaxed
part
of
the
strict
policy
of
augustus
he
gave
them
a
senate
and
a
municipal
form
of
government
a
privilege
that
had
hitherto
been
refused
in
distrust
to
that
great
city
though
freely
granted
in
other
provinces
where
rebellion
was
less
dreaded
he
also
ornamented
the
city
with
a
temple
to
rhea
and
with
a
public
bath
which
was
named
after
himself
the
bath
of
severus
severus
made
a
law
says
the
pagan
historian
forbidding
anybody
under
a
severe
punishment
from
becoming
jew
or
christian
but
he
who
gives
the
blow
is
likely
to
speak
of
it
more
lightly
than
he
who
smarts
under
it
and
we
learn
from
the
historian
of
the
church
that
in
the
tenth
year
of
this
reign
the
christians
suffered
persecution
from
their
governors
and
their
among
others
who
then
lost
their
lives
for
their
religion
was
leonides
the
father
of
origen
he
left
seven
orphan
children
of
whom
the
eldest
that
justly
celebrated
writer
was
only
sixteen
years
old
but
was
already
deeply
read
in
the
scriptures
and
in
the
great
writers
of
greece
as
the
property
of
leonides
was
forfeited
his
children
were
left
in
poverty
but
the
young
origen
was
adopted
by
a
wealthy
lady
zealous
for
the
new
religion
by
whose
help
he
was
enabled
to
continue
his
studies
under
clemens
in
order
to
read
the
old
testament
in
the
original
he
made
himself
master
of
hebrew
which
was
a
study
then
very
unusual
among
the
greeks
whether
jews
or
christians
in
this
persecution
of
the
church
all
public
worship
was
forbidden
to
the
christians
and
tertullian
of
carthage
eloquently
complains
that
while
the
emperor
allowed
the
egyptians
to
worship
cows
goats
or
crocodiles
or
indeed
any
animal
they
chose
he
only
punished
those
that
bowed
down
before
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
world
of
course
at
this
time
of
trouble
the
catechetical
school
was
broken
up
and
scattered
so
that
there
was
no
public
teaching
of
christianity
in
alexandria
but
origen
ventured
to
do
that
privately
which
was
forbidden
to
be
done
openly
and
when
the
storm
had
blown
over
demetrius
the
bishop
appointed
him
to
that
office
at
the
head
of
the
school
which
he
had
already
so
bravely
taken
upon
himself
in
the
hour
of
danger
origen
could
boast
of
several
pupils
who
added
their
names
to
the
noble
list
of
martyrs
who
lost
their
lives
for
christianity
among
whom
the
best
known
was
plutarch
the
brother
of
heraclas
origen
afterwards
removed
for
a
time
to
palestine
and
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
his
own
bishop
for
being
there
ordained
a
presbyter
in
egypt
severus
seems
to
have
dated
the
years
of
his
reign
from
the
death
of
niger
though
he
had
reigned
in
rome
since
the
deaths
of
pertinax
and
julian
his
egyptian
coins
are
either
copper
or
brass
plated
with
a
little
silver
and
after
a
few
reigns
even
those
last
traces
of
a
silver
coinage
are
lost
in
this
falling
country
in
tracing
the
history
of
a
meaning
we
often
throw
a
light
upon
the
customs
of
a
nation
thus
in
rome
gold
was
so
far
common
that
avarice
was
called
the
love
of
gold
while
in
greece
where
silver
was
the
metal
most
in
use
money
was
called
in
the
same
way
it
is
curiously
shown
that
silver
was
no
longer
used
in
egypt
by
our
finding
that
the
brass
coin
of
one
hundred
and
ten
grains
weight
as
being
the
only
piece
of
money
seen
in
circulation
was
named
an
the
latter
years
of
the
reign
of
caracalla
were
spent
in
visiting
the
provinces
of
his
wide
empire
and
after
he
had
passed
through
thrace
and
asia
minor
egypt
had
the
misfortune
to
be
honoured
by
a
visit
from
its
emperor
the
satirical
alexandrians
who
in
the
midst
of
their
own
follies
and
vices
were
always
clever
in
lashing
those
of
their
rulers
had
latterly
been
turning
their
unseemly
jokes
against
caracalla
they
had
laughed
at
his
dressing
like
achilles
and
alexander
the
great
while
in
his
person
he
was
below
the
usual
height
and
they
had
not
forgotten
his
murder
of
his
brother
and
his
talking
of
marrying
his
own
mother
some
of
these
dangerous
witticisms
had
reached
his
ears
at
rome
and
they
were
not
forgotten
but
caracalla
never
showed
his
displeasure
and
as
he
passed
through
antioch
he
gave
out
that
he
was
going
to
visit
the
city
founded
by
alexander
the
great
and
to
consult
the
oracle
in
the
temple
of
serapis
the
alexandrians
in
their
joy
got
ready
the
hecatombs
for
his
sacrifices
and
the
emperor
entered
their
city
through
rows
of
torches
to
the
sound
of
soft
music
while
the
air
was
sweetened
with
costly
scents
and
the
road
scattered
with
flowers
after
a
few
days
he
sacrificed
in
the
temple
of
serapis
and
then
visited
the
tomb
of
alexander
where
he
took
off
his
scarlet
cloak
his
rings
and
his
girdle
covered
with
precious
stones
and
dutifully
laid
them
on
the
sarcophagus
of
the
hero
the
alexandrians
were
delighted
with
their
visitor
and
crowds
flocked
into
the
city
to
witness
the
daily
and
nightly
shows
little
aware
of
the
unforgiving
malice
that
was
lurking
in
his
mind
the
emperor
then
issued
a
decree
that
all
the
youths
of
alexandria
of
an
age
to
enter
the
army
should
meet
him
in
a
plain
on
the
outside
of
the
city
they
had
already
a
macedonian
and
a
spartan
phalanx
and
he
was
going
to
make
an
alexandrian
phalanx
accordingly
the
plain
was
filled
with
thousands
of
young
men
who
were
ranged
in
bodies
according
to
their
height
their
age
and
their
fitness
for
bearing
arms
while
their
friends
and
relations
came
in
equal
numbers
to
be
witnesses
of
their
honour
the
emperor
moved
through
their
ranks
and
was
loudly
greeted
with
their
cheers
while
the
army
which
encircled
the
whole
plain
was
gradually
closing
round
the
crowd
and
lessening
the
circle
when
the
ring
was
formed
caracalla
withdrew
with
his
guards
and
gave
the
signal
the
soldiers
then
lowered
their
spears
and
charged
on
the
unarmed
crowd
of
whom
a
part
were
butchered
and
part
driven
headlong
into
the
ditches
and
canals
and
such
was
the
slaughter
that
the
waters
of
the
nile
which
at
midsummer
are
always
red
with
the
mud
from
the
upper
country
were
said
to
have
flowed
coloured
to
the
sea
with
the
blood
of
the
sufferers
caracalla
then
returned
to
antioch
congratulating
himself
on
the
revenge
that
he
had
taken
on
the
alexandrians
for
their
jokes
not
however
till
he
had
consecrated
in
the
temple
of
serapis
the
sword
with
which
he
boasted
that
he
had
slain
his
brother
geta
caracalla
also
punished
the
alexandrians
by
stopping
the
public
games
and
the
allowance
of
grain
to
the
citizens
and
to
lessen
the
danger
of
their
rebelling
he
had
the
fortifications
carried
between
the
rest
of
the
city
and
the
great
the
bruchium
thus
dividing
alexandria
into
two
fortified
cities
with
towers
on
the
walls
between
them
hitherto
under
the
romans
as
under
the
ptolemies
the
alexandrians
had
been
the
trusted
favourites
of
their
rulers
who
made
use
of
them
to
keep
the
egyptians
in
bondage
but
under
caracalla
that
policy
was
changed
the
alexandrians
were
treated
as
enemies
and
we
see
for
the
first
time
egyptians
taking
their
seat
in
the
roman
senate
and
the
egyptian
religion
openly
cultivated
by
the
emperor
who
then
built
a
temple
in
rome
to
the
goddess
isis
on
the
murder
of
caracalla
in
macrinus
who
was
thought
to
be
the
author
of
his
death
was
acknowledged
as
emperor
and
though
he
only
reigned
for
about
two
months
yet
as
the
egyptian
new
day
fell
within
that
time
we
find
alexandrian
coins
for
the
first
and
second
years
of
his
reign
the
egyptians
pretended
that
the
death
of
caracalla
had
been
foretold
by
signs
from
heaven
that
a
ball
of
fire
had
fallen
on
the
temple
of
serapis
which
destroyed
nothing
but
the
sword
with
which
caracalla
had
slain
his
brother
and
that
an
egyptian
named
serapion
who
had
been
thrown
into
a
den
for
naming
macrinus
as
the
future
emperor
had
escaped
unhurt
by
the
wild
beasts
macrinus
recalled
from
alexandria
julian
the
prefect
of
egypt
and
appointed
to
that
post
his
friend
basilianus
with
marius
secundus
a
senator
as
second
in
command
who
was
the
first
senator
that
had
ever
held
command
in
egypt
he
was
himself
at
antioch
when
bassianus
a
syrian
pretending
to
be
the
son
of
caracalla
offered
himself
to
the
legions
as
that
successor
when
the
news
reached
alexandria
that
the
syrian
troops
had
joined
the
pretended
antoninus
the
prefect
basilianus
at
once
put
to
death
the
public
couriers
that
brought
the
unwelcome
tidings
but
when
a
few
days
afterwards
it
was
known
that
macrinus
had
been
defeated
and
killed
the
doubts
about
his
successor
led
to
serious
struggles
between
the
troops
and
the
alexandrians
the
alexandrians
could
have
had
no
love
for
a
son
of
caracalla
basilianus
and
secundus
had
before
declared
against
him
but
on
the
other
hand
the
choice
of
the
soldiers
was
guided
by
their
brethren
in
syria
the
citizens
flew
to
arms
and
day
after
day
was
the
battle
fought
in
the
streets
of
alexandria
between
two
parties
neither
of
whom
was
strong
enough
even
if
successful
to
have
any
weight
in
settling
the
fate
of
the
roman
empire
marius
secundus
lost
his
life
in
the
struggle
the
prefect
basilianus
fled
to
italy
to
escape
from
his
own
soldiers
and
the
province
of
egypt
then
followed
the
example
of
the
rest
of
the
east
in
acknowledging
the
new
emperor
for
four
years
rome
was
disgraced
by
the
sovereignty
of
elagabalus
the
pretended
son
of
caracalla
and
we
find
his
coins
each
year
in
alexandria
he
was
succeeded
by
the
young
alexander
whose
amiable
virtues
however
could
not
gain
for
him
the
respect
which
he
lost
by
the
weakness
of
his
government
the
alexandrians
always
ready
to
lampoon
their
rulers
laughed
at
his
wish
to
be
thought
a
roman
they
called
him
the
syrian
the
high
priest
and
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
and
well
might
they
think
slightly
of
his
government
when
a
prefect
of
egypt
owed
his
appointment
to
the
want
of
power
to
punish
him
epagathus
had
headed
a
mutiny
of
the
prætorian
guards
in
rome
in
which
their
general
ulpian
was
killed
and
alexander
afraid
to
punish
the
murderers
made
the
ringleader
of
the
rebels
prefect
of
egypt
in
order
to
send
him
out
of
the
way
so
little
did
it
then
seem
necessary
to
follow
the
cautious
policy
of
augustus
or
to
fear
a
rebellion
in
that
province
but
after
a
short
time
when
epagathus
had
been
forgotten
by
the
roman
legion
he
was
removed
to
the
government
of
crete
and
then
at
last
punished
with
death
in
this
reign
ammonius
saccas
became
the
founder
of
a
new
and
most
important
school
of
philosophy
that
of
the
alexandrian
platonists
he
is
only
known
to
us
through
his
pupils
in
whose
writings
we
trace
the
mind
and
system
of
the
teacher
the
most
celebrated
of
these
pupils
were
plotinus
herennius
and
origen
a
pagan
writer
together
with
longinus
the
great
master
of
the
who
owns
him
his
teacher
in
elegant
literature
ammonius
was
unequalled
in
the
variety
and
depth
of
his
knowledge
and
was
by
his
followers
called
he
aimed
at
putting
an
end
to
the
triflings
and
quarrels
of
the
philosophers
by
showing
that
all
the
great
truths
were
the
same
in
each
system
and
by
pointing
out
where
plato
and
aristotle
agreed
instead
of
where
they
differed
or
rather
by
culling
opinions
out
of
both
schools
of
philosophy
and
by
gathering
together
the
scattered
limbs
of
truth
whose
lovely
form
had
been
hewn
to
pieces
and
thrown
to
the
four
winds
like
the
mangled
body
of
osiris
origen
in
the
tenth
year
of
this
reign
withdrew
to
cæsarea
on
finding
himself
made
uncomfortable
at
alexandria
by
the
displeasure
of
demetrius
the
bishop
and
he
left
the
care
of
the
christian
school
to
heraclas
who
had
been
one
of
his
pupils
opinions
met
with
no
blame
in
cæsarea
where
christianity
was
not
yet
so
far
removed
from
its
early
simplicity
as
in
egypt
the
christians
of
syria
and
palestine
highly
prized
his
teaching
when
it
was
no
longer
valued
in
alexandria
he
died
at
tyre
in
the
reign
of
gallus
illustration
a
modern
scribe
on
the
death
of
demetrius
heraclas
who
had
just
before
succeeded
origen
in
the
charge
of
the
christian
school
was
chosen
bishop
of
alexandria
and
christianity
had
by
that
time
so
far
spread
through
the
cities
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
ordain
twenty
bishops
under
him
while
three
had
been
found
enough
by
his
predecessor
from
his
being
the
head
of
the
bishops
who
were
all
styled
fathers
heraclas
received
the
title
of
pope
or
grandfather
the
title
afterwards
used
by
the
bishops
of
rome
among
the
presbyters
ordained
by
heraclas
was
ammonius
saccas
the
founder
of
the
platonic
school
but
he
afterwards
forsook
the
religion
of
jesus
and
we
must
not
mistake
him
for
a
second
alexandrian
christian
of
the
name
of
ammonius
who
can
hardly
have
been
the
same
person
as
the
former
for
he
never
changed
his
religion
and
was
the
author
of
the

work
afterwards
continued
by
eusebius
of
cæsarea

the
death
of
the
emperor
alexander

while
italy
was
torn
to
pieces
by
civil
wars
and
by
its
rival
claims
for
the
purple
the
alexandrians
seem
to
have
taken
no
part
in
the
struggles
but
to
have
acknowledged
each
emperor
as
soon
as
the
news
reached
them
that
he
had
taken
the
title
in
one
year
we
find
alexandrian
coins
of
maximin
and
his
son
maximus
with
those
of
the
two
gordians
who
for
a
few
weeks
reigned
in
carthage
and
in
the
next
year
we
again
have
coins
of
maximin
and
maximus
with
those
of
balbinus
and
pupienus
and
of
gordianus
pius
the
persians
taking
advantage
of
the
weakness
in
the
empire
caused
by
these
civil
wars
had
latterly
been
harassing
the
eastern
frontier
and
it
soon
became
the
duty
of
the
young
gordian
to
march
against
them
in
person
hitherto
the
roman
armies
had
usually
been
successful
but
unfortunately
the
persians
or
rather
their
syrian
and
arab
allies
had
latterly
risen
as
much
as
the
romans
had
fallen
off
in
courage
and
warlike
skill
the
army
of
gordian
was
routed
and
the
emperor
himself
slain
either
by
traitors
or
by
the
enemy
hereafter
we
shall
see
the
romans
paying
the
just
penalty
for
the
example
that
they
had
set
to
the
surrounding
nations
they
had
taught
them
that
conquest
should
be
a
chief
aim
that
the
great
use
of
strength
was
to
crush
a
neighbour
and
it
was
not
long
before
egypt
and
the
other
eastern
provinces
suffered
under
the
same
treatment
so
little
had
defeat
been
expected
that
the
philosopher
plotinus
had
left
his
studies
in
alexandria
to
join
the
army
in
hopes
of
gaining
for
himself
an
insight
into
the
eastern
philosophy
that
was
so
much
talked
of
in
egypt
after
the
rout
of
the
army
he
with
difficulty
escaped
to
antioch
and
thence
he
removed
to
rome
where
he
taught
the
new
platonism
to
scholars
of
all
nations
including
serapion
the
celebrated
rhetorician
and
eustochius
the
physician
from
alexandria
illustration

of
egypt
philip
who
is
accused
by
the
historians
of
being
the
author
of
death
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
in
but
he
is
only
known
in
the
history
of
egypt
by
his
alexandrian
coins
which
we
find
with
the
dates
of
each
of
the
seven
years
of
his
reign
and
these
seem
to
prove
that
for
one
year
he
had
been
associated
with
gordian
in
the
purple
in
the
reign
of
decius
which
began
in
the
christians
of
egypt
were
again
harassed
by
the
zeal
with
which
the
laws
against
their
religion
were
put
in
force
the
persecution
began
by
their
informing
against
them
but
in
the
next
year
it
was
followed
up
by
the
prefect
æmilianus
and
several
christians
were
summoned
before
the
magistrate
and
put
to
death
many
fled
for
safety
to
the
desert
and
to
mount
sinai
where
they
fell
into
a
danger
of
a
different
kind
they
were
taken
prisoners
by
the
saracens
and
carried
away
as
slaves
dionysius
the
bishop
of
alexandria
himself
fled
from
the
storm
and
was
then
banished
to
the
village
of
cephro
in
the
desert
but
his
flight
was
not
without
some
scandal
to
the
church
as
there
were
not
a
few
who
thought
that
he
was
called
upon
by
his
rank
at
least
to
await
if
not
to
court
the
pains
of
martyrdom
indeed
the
persecution
was
less
remarkable
for
the
sufferings
of
the
christians
than
for
the
numbers
who
failed
in
their
courage
and
renounced
christianity
under
the
threats
of
the
magistrate
dionysius
the
bishop
who
had
shown
no
courage
himself
was
willing
to
pardon
their
weakness
and
after
fit
proof
of
sorrow
again
to
receive
them
as
brethren
but
his
humanity
offended
the
zeal
of
many
whose
distance
from
the
danger
had
saved
them
from
temptation
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
summon
a
council
at
rome
to
settle
the
dispute
in
this
assembly
the
moderate
party
prevailed
and
some
who
refused
to
receive
back
those
who
had
once
fallen
away
from
the
faith
were
themselves
turned
out
of
the
church
dionysius
had
succeeded
heraclas
in
the
bishopric
having
before
succeeded
him
as
head
of
the
catechetical
school
he
was
the
author
of
several
works
written
in
defence
of
the
trinitarian
opinions
on
the
one
hand
against
the
egyptian
gnostics
who
said
that
there
were
eight
and
even
thirty
persons
in
the
godhead
and
on
the
other
hand
against
the
syrian
bishop
paul
of
samosata
on
the
euphrates
who
said
that
jesus
was
a
man
and
that
the
word
and
holy
spirit
were
not
persons
but
attributes
of
god
but
while
dionysius
was
thus
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
such
opposite
opinions
egypt
and
libya
were
giving
birth
to
a
new
view
of
the
trinity
sabellius
bishop
of
ptolemais
near
cyrene
was
putting
forth
the
opinion
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
were
only
three
names
for
the
one
god
and
that
the
creator
of
the
world
had
himself
appeared
upon
earth
in
the
form
of
jesus
against
this
opinion
dionysius
again
engaged
in
controversy
arguing
against
sabellius
that
jesus
was
not
the
creator
but
the
first
of
created
beings
the
christians
were
thus
each
generation
changing
more
and
more
sometimes
leaning
towards
greek
polytheism
and
sometimes
towards
egyptian
mysticism
as
in
each
quarrel
the
most
mysterious
opinions
were
thought
the
most
sacred
each
generation
added
new
mysteries
to
its
religion
and
the
progress
was
rapid
from
a
practical
piety
to
a
profession
of
opinions
which
they
did
not
pretend
to
understand
during
the
reigns
of
gallus
of
æmilius
æmilianus
and
of
valerian
the
alexandrians
coined
money
in
the
name
of
each
emperor
as
soon
as
the
news
reached
egypt
that
he
had
made
italy
acknowledge
his
title

and
his
son
reigned
two
years
and
four
months
æmilianus
who
rebelled
in
pannonia
reigned
three
months
and
valerian
reigned
about
six
years
egypt
as
a
trading
country
now
suffered
severely
from
the
want
of
order
and
quiet
government
and
in
particular
since
the
reign
of
alexander
severus
it
had
been
kept
in
a
fever
by
rebellions
persecutions
and
this
unceasing
change
of
rulers
change
brings
the
fear
of
change
and
this
fear
checks
trade
throws
the
labourer
out
of
employment
and
leaves
the
poor
of
the
cities
without
wages
and
without
food
famine
is
followed
by
disease
and
egypt
and
alexandria
were
visited
in
the
reign
of
gallus
by
a
dreadful
plague
one
of
those
scourges
that
force
themselves
on
the
notice
of
the
historian
it
was
probably
the
same
disease
that
in
a
less
frightful

it
seems
by
the
letters
of
bishop
dionysius
that
in
alexandria
the
population
had
so
much
fallen
off
that
the
inhabitants
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
eighty
were
not
more
than
those
between
forty
and
seventy
had
been
formerly

appeared
by
old
records

existing
the
misery
that
the
city
had
suffered
may
be
measured
by
its
lessened
numbers
during
these
latter
years
the
eastern
half
of
the
empire
was
chiefly
guarded
by
odenathus
of
palmyra
the
brave
and
faithful
ally
of
rome
under
whose
wise
rule
his
country
for
a
short
time
held
a
rank
among
the
empires
of
the
world
which
it
never
could
have
gained
but
for
an
union
of
many
favourable
circumstances

situated
about
midway

the
cities
of
damascus
and
babylon
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
between
the
roman
and
the
parthian
empires
palmyra
had
long
kept
its
freedom
while
each
of
those
great
rival
powers
rather
courted
its
friendship
than
aimed
at
conquering
it
but
as
the
cause
of
rome
grew
weaker
odenathus
wisely
threw
his
weight
into
the
lighter
scale
and
latterly
without
aiming
at
conquest
he
found
himself
almost
the
sovereign
of
those
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
which
were
in
danger
of
being
overrun
by
the

valerian

taken

to

by

king
of
persia

gallienus
his
son
who
was
idling
away
his
life
in
disgraceful
pleasures
in

west
wisely
gave
the
title
of
emperor
to
odenathus
and
declared
him
his

no

than
every
province
of
the
roman
empire
feeling
the
sword
powerless
in
the
weak
hands
of
gallienus
declared
its
own
general
emperor
and
when
macrianus
who
had
been
left
in
command
in
syria
gathered
together
the
scattered
forces
of
the
eastern
army
and
made
himself
emperor
of
the
east
the
egyptians
owned
him
as
their
sovereign
as
macrianus
found
his
age
too
great
for
the
activity
required
of
a
rebel
emperor
he
made
his
two
sons
macrianus
junior
and
quietus
his
colleagues
and
we
find
their
names
on
the
coins
of
alexandria
dated
the
first
and
second
years
of
their
reign
but
macrianus
was
defeated
by
dominitianus
at
the
head
of
a
part
of
the
army
of
aureolus
who
had
made
himself
emperor
in
illyricum
and
he
lost
his
life
together
with
one
of
his
sons
while
the
other
soon
afterwards
met
with
the
same
fate
from
odenathus
after
this
egypt
was
governed
for
a
short
time
in
the
name
of
gallienus
but
the
fickle
alexandrians
soon
made
a
rebel
emperor
for
themselves
the
roman
republic
says
the
historian
was
often
in
danger
from
the
headstrong
giddiness
of
the
alexandrians
any
civility
forgotten
a
place
in
the
baths
not
yielded
a
heap
of
rubbish
or
even
a
pair
of
old
shoes
in
the
streets
was
often
enough
to
throw
the
state
into
the
greatest
danger
and
make
it
necessary
to
call
out
the
troops
to
put
down
the
riots
thus
one
day
one
of
the
slaves
was
beaten
by
the
soldiers
for
saying
that
his
shoes
were
better
than
theirs
on
this
a
riotous
crowd
gathered
round
the
house
of
æmilianus
to
complain
of
the
conduct
of
his
soldiers
he
was
attacked
with
stones
and
such
weapons
as
are
usually
within
the
reach
of
a
mob
he
had
no
choice
but
to
call
out
the
troops
who
when
they
had
quieted
the
city
and
were
intoxicated
with
their
success
saluted
him
with
the
title
of
emperor
and
hatred
of
gallienus
made
the
rest
of
the
egyptian
army
agree
to
their
choice
this
was
in
the
year
the
new
emperor
called
himself
alexander
and
was
even
thought
to
deserve
the
name
he
governed
egypt
during
his
short
reign
with
great
vigour
he
led
his
army
through
the
thebaid
and
drove
back
the
barbarians
with
a
courage
and
activity
which
had
latterly
been
uncommon
in
the
egyptian
army
alexandria
then
sent
no
tribute
to
rome
can
not
we
live
without
egyptian
linen
was
the
forced
joke
of
gallienus
when
the
romans
were
in
alarm
at
the
loss
of
the
usual
supply
of
grain
but
æmilianus
was
soon
beaten
by
theodotus
the
general
of
gallienus
who
besieged
him
in
the
strong
quarter
of
alexandria
called
the
bruchium
and
then
took
him
prisoner
and
strangled
him
during
this
siege
the
ministers
of
christianity
were
able
to
lessen
some
of
the
horrors
of
war
by
persuading
the
besiegers
to
allow
the
useless
mouths
to
quit
the
blockaded
fortress
eusebius
afterwards
bishop
of
laodicea
was
without
the
trenches
trying
to
lessen
the
cruelties
of
the
siege
and
anatolius
the
christian
peripatetic
was
within
the
walls
endeavouring
to
persuade
the
rebels
to
surrender
gallienus
in
gratitude
to
his
general
would
have
granted
him
the
honour
of
a
proconsular
triumph
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
alexandrians
but
the
policy
of
augustus
was
not
wholly
forgotten
and
the
emperor
was
reminded
by
the
priests
that
it
was
unlawful
for
the
consular
fasces
to
enter
alexandria
the
late
emperor
valerian
had
begun
his
reign
with
mild
treatment
of
the
christians
but
he
was
overpersuaded
by
the
alexandrians
he
then
allowed
the
power
of
the
magistrate
to
be
used
in
order
to
check
the
christian
religion
but
in
this
weakness
of
the
empire
gallienus
could
no
longer
with
safety
allow
the
christians
to
be
persecuted
for
their
religion
both
their
numbers
and
their
station
made
it
dangerous
to
treat
them
as
enemies
and
the
emperor
ordered
all
persecution
to
be
stopped
the
imperial
rescript
for
that
purpose
was
even
addressed
to
pinna
demetrius
and
the
other
bishops
it
grants
them
full
indulgence
in
the
exercise
of
their
religion
and
by
its
very
address
almost
acknowledges
their
rank
in
the
state
by
this
edict
of
gallienus
the
christians
were
put
on
a
better
footing
than
at
any
time
since
their
numbers
brought
them
under
the
notice
of
the
magistrate

clung

love
they
visited

and
a

she
had
the
commanding
qualities
of

from
whom
her
flatterers
traced
her
descent
and
she
was
without
her

her
half
of
the
empire
like
a
man
zenobia
made
antioch
and
palmyra
the
capitals
of
her
empire
and
egypt
became
for
the
time
a
province

her

as
her

were

saracens

arabs
a
people
nearly
the
same
as
the
blemmyes
who
already
formed
part
of
the
people
of
upper
egypt
this
conquest
gave
a
new
rank
to
that
part
of
the
population
and
had
the
further
result
important
in
after
years
of
causing
them
to
be
less
quiet
in
their
slavery
to
the
greeks
of
alexandria
but
the
sceptre
of
rome
had
lately
been
grasped
by
the
firmer
hand
of
aurelian
and
the
reign
of
zenobia
drew
to
a
close
aurelian
at
first
granted
her
the
title
of
his
colleague
in
the
empire
and
we
find
alexandrian
coins
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
his
on
the
other
but
he
lost
no
time
in
leading
his
forces
into
syria
and
after
routing
army
in
one
or
two
battles
he
took
her
prisoner
at
emessa
he
then
led
her
to
rome
where
after
being
made
the
ornament
of
his
triumph
she
was
allowed
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
in
quiet
having
reigned
for
four
years
in
palmyra
though
only
for
a
few
months
in
egypt
on
the
defeat
of
zenobia
it
would
seem
that
egypt
and
syria
were
still
left
under
the
government
of
one
of
her
sons
with
the
title
of
colleague
of
aurelian
the
alexandrian
coins
are
then
dated
in
the
first
year
of
aurelian
and
the
fourth
of
vaballathus
or
according
to
the
greek
translation
of
this
name
of
athenodorus
who
counted
his
years
from
the
death
of
odenathus
the
young
herodes
who
had
been
killed
with
his
father
odenathus
was
not
the
son
of
zenobia
but
of
a
former
wife
and
zenobia
always
acted
towards
him
with
the
unkindness
unfortunately
too
common
in
a
stepmother
she
had
claimed
the
throne
for
her
infant
sons
herennius
and
timolaus
and
we
are
left
in
doubt
by
the
historians
about
vaballathus
vopiscus
who
calls
him
the
son
of
zenobia
does
not
tell
us
who
was
his
father
we
know
but
little
of
him
beyond
his
coins
but
from
these
we
learn
that
after
reigning
one
year
with
aurelian
he
aimed
at
reigning
alone
took
the
title
of
augustus
and
dropped
the
name
of
aurelian
from
his
coins
this
step
was
very
likely
the
cause
of
his
overthrow
and
death
which
happened
in
the
year
on
the
overthrow
of

which
had
been
so
fruitful
in
rebels

emperor
aurelian
but
it
was
only
for
a
few
months
the
greeks
of
alexandria
now
lessened
in
numbers
were
found
to
be
no
longer
masters
of
the
kingdom
former
rebellions
in
egypt
had
been
caused
by
the
two
roman
legions
and
the
greek
mercenaries
sometimes
claiming
the
right
to
appoint
an
emperor
to
the
roman
world
but
conquest
had
raised
the
egyptian
and
arab
population
in
their
own
opinion
and
they
were
no
longer
willing
to
be
governed
by
an
alexandrian
or
european
master
in
they
set
up
firmus
a
native
of
seleucia
who
took
the
title
of
emperor
and
resting
his
power
on
that
part
of
the
population
that
had
been
treated
as
slaves
or
barbarians
for
six
hundred
years

aimed
at
the
conquest
of
alexandria

was
a
man
of
great
size
and
bodily
strength
and
of
course
barbarian
manners
he
had
gained
great
riches
by
trade
with
india
and
had
a
paper
trade
so
profitable
that
he
used
to
boast
that
he
could
feed
an
army
on
papyrus
and
glue
his
house
was
furnished
with
glass
windows
a
luxury
then
but
little
known
and
the
squares
of
glass
were
fastened
into
the
frames
by

of

his
chief
strength
was
in
the
arabs

blemmyes
of
upper
egypt
and
in
the
saracens
who
had
lately
been
fighting
against
rome
under
the
standard
of
zenobia
firmus
fixed
his
government
at

and

he
either
never
conquered

did
not
hold
it

many

year

took

put
to

troubles

had
been
thrown
into

the
thoughts
of
losing

since
the
reign
of

the

had
never

more
than
was
wanted
for

but
aurelian
hastened
to
send
word
to
the
roman
people
that
the
country
was
again
quiet
and
that
the
yearly
supplies
which
had
been
delayed
by

we

no

knowledge
of
the

in

he
rebelled

indeed
without
the
help
of
the
coins
should
we
know
in
what
province
of
the

he
had
assumed
the

the
historian
only
tells
us
that
in
the
reign
of
aurelian
the
general
domitianus
was
put
to
death
for
aiming
at
a
change
we
learn
however
from
the
coins
that
he
reigned
for
part
of
a
first
and
a
second
year
in
egypt
but
the
subject
of
his
reign
is
not
without
its
difficulties
as
we
find
alexandrian
coins
of
domitianus
with
latin
inscriptions
and
dated
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
the
latin
language
had
not
at
this
time
been
used
on
the
coins
of
alexandria
and
he
could
not
have
held
alexandria
for
any
one
whole
year
as
the
series
of
coins
is
not
broken
it
is
possible
that
the
latin
coins
of
domitianus
may
belong
to
a
second
and
later
usurper
of
the
same
name
aurelian
had
reigned
in
rome
from
the
death
of
claudius
and
notwithstanding
the
four
rebels
to
whom
we
have
given
the
title
of
sovereigns
of
egypt
money
was
coined
in
alexandria
in
his
name
during
each
of
those
years
his
coinage
however
reminds
us
of
the
troubled
and
fallen
state
of
the
country
and
from
this
time
forward
copper
or
rather
brass
is
the
only
metal
used
aurelian
left
probus
in
the
command
of
the
egyptian
army
and
that
skill
and
activity
found
full
employment
in
driving
back
the
barbarians
who
pressed
upon
the
province
on

of
the
three
sides
on
which
it
was
open

were

were

on

side

and
he
next
took
the
field
against
the
palmyrenes

who
still
claimed

in

employed

in
widening

other
works
as
were

far
took
courage
as
to
build

of
mary
in
alexandria
this
was
probably
the
first
church
that
was
built
in
egypt
for
the
public
service
of
christianity
which
for
two
hundred
years
had
been
preached
in
private
rooms
and
very
often
in
secret
the
service
was
in
greek
as
indeed
it
was
in
all
parts
of
egypt
for
it
does
not
appear
that
christian
prayers
were
publicly
read
in
the
egyptian
language
before
the
quarrel
between
the
two
churches
made
the
kopts
unwilling
to
use
greek
prayers
the
liturgy
there
read
was
probably
very
nearly
the
same
as
that
afterwards
known
as
the
of
this
is
among
the
oldest
of
the
christian
liturgies

its

may
rise

historians
that

months
were

of
a
successor

time
the
power
rested
in
the

of
his
widow
the
sway
of
a
woman
was
never
openly
acknowledged
in
rome
but
the
alexandrians
and
egyptians
were
used
to
female
rule
and
from
contemporary
coins
we
learn
that
in
egypt
the
government
was
carried
on

the
name
of

by

but
when
the
news
reached
egypt
it
was
at
once
felt
by
the
legions
that
probus
both
by
his
own
personal
qualities
and
by
the
high
state
of
discipline
of
the
army
under
his
command
and
by
his
success
against
the
egyptian
rebels
had
a
better
claim
to
the
purple
than
any

opinion
ran
round
the
camp
in

whisper

spoke

aloud

snatched
a

cloak
from

over

on

earthen

will
saluted

afterwards
marched
into

was
recalled
into

by
hearing
that

had
risen
in

only

had
for
centuries
been
an

even

the
greek
capital
of
the
thebaid
was
now
peopled
by
those
barbarians
and
they
had
to
be
reconquered
by
probus
as
foreign
cities
and
kept
in
obedience
by
roman
garrisons
and
on
his
return
to
rome
he
thought
his
victories
over
the
blemmyes
of
upper
egypt
not
unworthy
of
a
triumph
by
these
unceasing
wars
the

legions
had
lately
been
brought
into
a
high
state
of
discipline

their
strength
and
in
the
success
with
which
they
had
made
their
late

now
attempted
to
raise
up

to
him

person
of
their
present
general

saturninus
had
been
made
general
of
the
eastern
frontier
by
aurelian
who
had
given
him
strict
orders
never
to
enter
egypt
egyptians
says
the
historian
meaning
however
the
alexandrians
boastful
vain
spiteful
licentious
fond
of
change
clever
in
making
songs
and
epigrams
against
their
rulers
and
much
given
to
soothsaying
and
aurelian
well
knew
that
the
loyalty
of
a
successful
general
was
not
to
be
trusted
in
egypt
and
during
his
lifetime
saturninus
never
entered
that
province
but
after
his
death
when
probus
was
called
away
to
the
other
parts
of
the
empire
the
government
of
egypt
was
added
to
the
other
duties
of
saturninus
and
no
sooner
was
he
seen
there
at
the
head
of
an
army
that
seemed
strong
enough
to
enforce
his
wishes
than
the
fickle
alexandrians
saluted
him
with
the
title
of
emperor
and
augustus
but
saturninus
was
a
wise
man
and
shunned
the
dangerous
honour
he
had
hitherto
fought
always
for
his
country
he
had
saved
the
provinces
of
spain
gaul
and
africa
from
the
enemy
or
from
rebellion
and
he
knew
the
value
of
his
rank
and
character
too
well
to
fling
it
away
for
a
bauble
to
escape
from
further
difficulties
he
withdrew
from
egypt
and
moved
his
headquarters
into
palestine
but
the
treasonable
cheers
of
the
alexandrians
could
neither
be
forgotten
by
himself
nor
by
his
troops
he
had
withstood
the
calls
of
ambition
but
he
yielded
at
last
to
his
fears
he
became
a
rebel
for
fear
of
being
thought
one
and
he
declared
himself
emperor
as
the
safest
mode
of
escaping
punishment
but
he
was
soon

defeated
and
strangled

were
routed
whenever

were
bold
enough
to
meet

rebellion

came
to
egypt

the
cities
of
koptos
and

were
besieged
by
the
emperor
in
person
and
wholly
destroyed
after
a
regular
siege
when
diocletian
reached
the
southern
limits
of
egypt
he
was
able
to
judge
of
the
difficulty
and
indeed
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
hold
any
part
of
ethiopia
and
he
found
that
the
tribute
levied
there
was
less
than
the
cost
of
the
troops
required
to
collect
it
he
therefore
made
a
new
treaty
with
the
nobatæ
as
the
people
between

first
and

now
called

sum

no

to

of

cataract
but
so
much
was
the
strength
of
the
greek
party
lessened
and
so
deeply
rooted
among
the
egyptians
was
their
hatred
of
their
rulers
and
the
belief
that
they
should
then
be
able
to
throw
off
the
yoke
that
soon
afterwards
alexandria
declared
in
favour
of
achilleus

the

surrounded
it
with

turned
aside

supplied

citizens
with

tedious
siege

eight
months

was
at

taken
by

in
and

was
put
to
death
a
large
part
of
the
city
was
burnt
at
the
storming
nor
would
the
punishment
of
the
citizens
have
there
ended
but
for
humane
interpretation
of
an
accident
the
horse
on
which
he
sat
stumbled
as
he
entered
the
city
with
his
troops
and
he
had
the
humanity
to
understand
it
as
a
command
from
heaven
that
he
should
stop
the
pillage
of
the
city
and
the
citizens
in
gratitude
erected
near
the
spot

statue
of
the
horse

which
they
owed

been
everywhere
rising
were
ordered
to
be
destroyed
and
the
bibles
to
be
burnt
while
banishment
slavery
and
death
were
the
punishments
threatened
against
those
who
obstinately
clung
to
their
religion
in
no
province
of
the
empire
was
the
persecution
more
severe
than
in
egypt
and
many
christians
fled
to
syria
where
the
law
though
the
same
was
more
mildly
carried
into
execution
but
the
christians
were
too
numerous
to
fly
and
too
few
to
resist
the
ecclesiastical
writers
present
us
with
a
sad
tale
of
tortures
and
of
death
borne
by
those
who
refused
to
renounce
their
faith
a
tale
which
is
only
made
less
sad
by
the
doubt
how
far
the
feelings
may
have
misled
their
judgment
and
made
them
overstate
the
numbers
but
we
may
safely
rely
upon
the
account
which
eusebius
gives
us
of
what
he
himself
saw
in
egypt
many
were
put
to
death
on
the
same
day
some
beheaded
and
some
burnt
the
executioners
were
tired
and
the
hearts
of
the
pagan
judges
melted
by
the
unflinching
firmness
of
the
christians
many
who
were
eminent
for
wealth
rank
and
learning
chose
to
lay
down
their
lives
rather
than
throw
a
few
grains
of
wheat
upon
the
altar
or
comply
with
any
ceremony
that
was
required
of
them
as
a
religious
test
the
judges
begged
them
to
think
of
their
wives
and
children
and
pointed
out
that
they
were
the
cause
of
their
own
death
but
the
christians
were
usually
firm
and
were
beheaded
for
the
refusal
to
take
the
test
among
the
most
celebrated
of
the
egyptian
martyrs
were
peter
bishop
of
alexandria
with
faustus
dius
and
ammonius
presbyters
under
him
the
learned
phileas
bishop
of
thmuis
hesychius
the
editor
of
the
septuagint
and
the
bishops
pachomius
and
theodorus
though
the
pagans
must
have
been
still
more
surprised
at
philoromus
the
of
the
taxes
at
alexandria
this
man
after
the
prefect
of
egypt
and
the
general
of
the
troops
was
perhaps
the
highest
roman
officer
in
the
province
he
sat
in
public
as
a
judge
in
alexandria
surrounded
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
daily
deciding
all
causes
relating
to
the
taxes
of
egypt
he
was
accused
of
no
crime
but
that
of
being
a
christian
which
he
was
earnestly
entreated
to
deny
and
was
at
liberty
indirectly
to
disprove
by
joining
in
some
pagan
sacrifice
the
bishops
of
alexandria
and
thmuis
may
have
been
strengthened
under
their
trials
by
their
rank
in
the
church
by
having
themselves
urged
others
to
do
their
duty
in
the
same
case
but
the
of
the
taxes
could
have
had
nothing
to
encourage
him
but
the
strength
of
his
faith
and
a
noble
scorn
of
falsehood
he
was
reproached
or
ridiculed
by
all
around
him
but
he
refused
to
deny
his
religion
and
was
beheaded
as
a
common
criminal
the
ready
ministers
of
this
persecution
were
culeianus
the
prefect
of
the
thebaid
and
hierocles
the
prefect
of
alexandria
the
latter
was
peculiarly
well
chosen
for
the
task
he
added
the
zeal
of
the
theologian
to
the
ready
obedience
of
the
soldier
he
had
written
against
the
christians
a
work
named
the
lover
of
truth
which
we
now
know
only
in
the
answer
by
eusebius
of
cæsarea
in
this
he
denounced
the
apostles
as
impostors
and
the
christian
miracles
as
trifling
and
comparing
them
with
the
pretended
miracles
of
apollonius
of
tyana
he
pronounced
the
latter
more
numerous
more
important
and
better
authenticated
than
the
former
by
the
evangelists
and
he
ridiculed
the
christians
for
calling
jesus
a
god
while
the
pagans
did
not
raise
apollonius
higher
than
a
man
beloved
by
the
gods
this
persecution
under
diocletian
was
one
of
the
most
severe
that
the
christians
ever
underwent
from
the
romans
it
did
not
however
wholly
stop
the
religious
services
nor
break
up
the
regular
government
of
the
church
in
the
catechetical
school
pierius
whom
we
have
before
spoken
of
as
a
man
of
learning
was
succeeded
by
theognostus
and
then
by
serapion
whose
name
reminds
us
that
the
egyptian
party
was
gaining
weight
in
the
alexandrian
church
it
can
hardly
have
been
for
his
superior
learning
it
may
have
been
because
his
opinions
were
becoming
more
popular
than
those
of
the
greeks
that
a
professor
with
an
egyptian
name
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
catechetical
school
serapion
was
succeeded
by
peter
who
afterwards
gained
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
and
a
crown
but
these
men
were
little
known
beyond
their
in
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
on
the
death
of
peter
the
bishop
of
alexandria
who
lost
his
life
as
a
martyr
the
presbyters
of
the
church
met
to
choose
a
successor
among
their
number
was
arius
whose
name
afterwards
became
so
famous
in
ecclesiastical
history
and
who
had
already
even
before
he
was
ordained
a
priest
offended
many
by
the
bold
manner
in
which
he
stated
his
religious
opinions
but
upon
him
if
we
may
believe
a
partial
historian
the
majority
of
votes
fell
in
the
choice
of
a
patriarch
of
alexandria
and
had
he
not
himself
modestly
given
way
to
the
more
ambitious
alexander
he
might
perhaps
have
been
saved
from
the
treatment
which
he
afterwards
suffered
from
his
rival
when
in
the
year
diocletian
and
his
colleague
valerius
maximian
resigned
the
purple
egypt
with
the
rest
of
the
east
was
given
to
galerius
who
had
also
as
cæsar
been
named
maximian
on
his
egyptian
coins
while
constantius
chlorus
ruled
the
west
galerius
in
granted
some
slight
indulgence
to
the
christians
without
wholly
stopping
the
persecution
but
all
favour
was
again
withdrawn
from
them
by
his
successor
maximin
who
had
indeed
misgoverned
egypt
for
some
years
under
the
title
of
cæsar
before
the
rank
of
augustus
was
granted
to
him
he
encouraged
private
informers
he
set
townsman
against
townsman
and
as
the
wishes
of
the
emperor
are
quickly
understood
by
all
under
him
those
who
wished
for
his
favour
courted
it
by
giving
him
an
excuse
for
his
cruelties
the
cities
sent
up
petitions
to
him
begging
that
the
christians
might
not
be
allowed
to
have
churches
within
their
walls
the
history
of
these
reigns
indeed
is
little
more
than
the
history
of
the
persecutions
and
when
the
alexandrian
astronomers
dropping
the
era
of
augustus
began
to
date
from
the
first
year
of
diocletian
the
christian
writers
in
the
same
way
dated
from
the
era
of
the
martyrs
it
can
be
no
matter
of
surprise
to
us
that
in
a
persecution
which
threatened
all
classes
of
society
there
should
have
been
many
who
when
they
were
accused
of
being
christians
wanted
the
courage
to
undergo
the
pains
of
martyrdom
and
escaped
the
punishment
by
joining
in
a
pagan
sacrifice
when
the
storm
was
blown
over
these
men
again
asked
to
be
received
into
the
church
and
their
conduct
gave
rise
to
the
very
same
quarrel
that
had
divided
the
christians
in
the
reign
of
decius
meletius
a
bishop
of
the
thebaid
was
at
the
head
of
the
party
who
would
make
no
allowance
for
the
weakness
of
their
brethren
and
who
refused
to
grant
to
the
repentant
the
forgiveness
that
they
asked
for
he
had
himself
borne
the
same
trials
without
bending
he
had
been
sent
as
a
criminal
to
work
in
the
egyptian
mines
and
had
returned
to
alexandria
from
his
banishment
proud
of
his
sufferings
and
furious
against
those
who
had
escaped
through
cowardice
but
the
larger
part
of
the
bishops
were
of
a
more
forgiving
nature
they
could
not
all
boast
of
the
same
constancy
and
the
repentant
christians
were
into
communion
with
the
faithful
while
the
followers
of
meletius
were
branded
with
the
name
of
heretics
in
alexandria
meletius
soon
found
another
and
as
it
proved
a
more
memorable
occasion
for
the
display
of
his
zeal
he
has
the
unenviable
honour
of
being
the
author
of
the
great
arian
quarrel
by
accusing
of
heresy
arius
at
that
time
a
presbyter
of
the
church
of
baucala
near
alexandria
and
by
calling
upon
alexander
the
bishop
to
inquire
into
his
belief
and
to
condemn
it
if
found
unsound
arius
frankly
and
openly
acknowledged
his
opinions
he
thought
jesus
a
created
being
and
would
speak
of
him
in
no
higher
terms
than
those
used
in
the
new
testament
and
creed
and
defended
his
opinions
by
an
appeal
to
the
scriptures
but
he
soon
found
that
his
defence
was
thought
weak
and
without
waiting
to
be
condemned
he
withdrew
before
the
storm
to
palestine
where
he
remained
till
summoned
before
the
council
of
nicæa
in
the
coming
reign
it
was
during
these
reigns
of
trouble
about
which
history
is
sadly
silent
when
greek
learning
was
sinking
and
after
the
country
had
been
for
a
year
or
two
in
the
power
of
the
syrians
that
the
worship
of
mithra
was
brought
into
alexandria
where
superstitious
ceremonies
and
philosophical
subtleties
were
equally
welcome
mithra
was
the
persian
god
of
the
sun
and
in
the
system
of
two
gods
one
good
and
the
other
wicked
he
was
the
god
of
goodness
illustration
symbol
of
mithra
the
chief
symbol
in
his
worship
was
the
figure
of
a
young
hero
in
phrygian
cap
and
trousers
mounted
on
a
sinking
bull
and
stabbing
it
in
sacrifice
to
the
god
in
a
deserted
part
of
alexandria
called
the
mithrium
his
rites
were
celebrated
among
ruins
and
rubbish
and
his
ignorant
followers
were
as
ignorantly
accused
of
there
slaying
their
on
his
altars
it
was
about
the
same
time
that
the
eastern
doctrine
of
manicheism
was
said
to
have
been
brought
into
egypt
by
papus
and
thomas
or
hernias
this
sect
if
sect
it
may
be
called
owed
its
origin
to
a
certain
majus
mani
banished
from
persia
under
the
sassanides
this
mani
was
a
talented
man
highly
civilised
through
his
studies
and
voyages
in
distant
lands
in
his
exile
he
conceived
the
idea
of
putting
himself
forward
as
the
reformer
of
the
religions
of
all
the
peoples
he
had
visited
and
of
reducing
them
all
to
one
universal
religion
banished
by
the
christians
to
whom
he
represented
himself
as
the
divinely
inspired
apostle
of
jesus
in
whom
the
comforter
had
appeared
he
returned
to
persia
taking
with
him
a
book
of
the
gospels
adorned
by
extraordinary
paintings
here
he
obtained
at
first
the
favour
of
the
king
and
the
people
till
finally
after
many
changes
of
fortune
he
was
pursued
by
the
magi
and
convicted
in
a
solemn
disputation
of
falsifying
religion
he
was
condemned
to
the
terrible
punishment
of
being
flayed
alive
after
which
his
skin
was
to
be
stuffed
and
hung
up
over
the
gates
of
the
royal
city
his
teaching
consisted
in
a
mixture
of
persian
and
views
its
middle
final
point
was
the
dualism
of
good
and
evil
which
rules
in
the
world
and
in
the
human
breast
according
to
creed
there
were
originally
two
principles
god
in
his
kingdom
of
light
and
the
demon
with
his
kingdom
of
darkness
and
these
two
principles
existed
independently
of
each
other
the
powers
of
evil
fell
into
strife
with
each
other
until
hurled
away
by
their
inward
confusion
they
reached
the
outermost
edge
of
their
own
kingdom
and
from
there
beheld
the
kingdom
of
light
in
all
its
glory
now
they
ceased
their
strife
among
themselves
and
united
to
do
battle
to
the
kingdom
of
light
to
meet
them
god
created
the
who
armed
with
the
five
pure
elements
light
fire
air
water
and
earth
advanced
to
meet
the
hostile
powers
he
was
defeated
though
finally
saved
but
a
part
of
his
light
had
thus
made
its
way
into
the
realm
of
darkness
in
order
gradually
to
regain
this
light
god
caused
the
mother
of
life
to
create
the
visible
world
in
which
that
light
lies
hidden
as
a
living
power
or
awaiting
its
deliverance
from
the
bonds
of
matter
in
order
to
accomplish
this
redemption
two
new
beings
of
light
proceed
from
god
viz
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
of
whom
the
former
christus
mithras
has
his
abode
in
the
sun
and
moon
the
latter
in
the
ether
diffused
around
the
entire
world
both
attract
the
powers
of
light
which
have
sunk
into
the
material
world
in
order
to
lead
them
back
finally
into
the
everlasting
realm
of
light
to
oppose
them
however
the
demons
created
a
new
being
viz
man
after
the
example
of
the
man
and
united
in
him
the
clearest
light
and
the
darkness
peculiar
to
themselves
in
order
that
the
great
strife
might
be
renewed
in
his
breast
and
so
man
became
the
point
of
union
of
all
the
forces
in
the
universe
the
microcosm
in
which
two
principles
ever
strive
for
the
mastery
through
the
enticements
of
the
material
and
the
illusions
of
the
demon
the
soul
of
light
was
held
in
bondage
in
spite
of
its
indwelling
capacity
for
freedom
so
that
in
heathenism
and
judaism
the
of
everlasting
light
as
the
soul
of
the
universe
was
chained
to
matter
in
order
to
accomplish
this
work
of
redemption
more
quickly
christ
finally
leaves
his
throne
at
right
hand
and
appears
on
earth
truly
in
human
form
but
only
with
an
apparent
body
his
suffering
and
death
on
the
cross
are
but
illusions
for
the
multitude
although
historical
facts
and
they
serve
at
the
same
time
as
a
symbol
of
the
light
imprisoned
in
matter
and
as
a
typical
expression
of
the
suffering
poured
out
over
the
whole
of
nature
especially
in
the
of
the
great
physical
christ
through
his
teaching
and
power
of
attraction
began
the
deliverance
of
the
light
so
that
one
can
truly
say
that
the
salvation
of
the
world
proceeds
from
rays
which
stream
from
the
cross
as
however
his
teachings
were
conceived
by
the
apostles
in
a
jewish
sense
and
the
gospels
were
disfigured
mani
appeared
as
the
comforter
promised
by
christ
to
accomplish
the
victory
in
his
writings
only
is
the
pure
truth
preserved
finally
there
will
be
a
complete
separation
of
the
light
from
the
darkness
and
then
the
powers
of
darkness
will
fall
upon
each
other
again
the
ignorant
in
all
ages
of
christianity
seem
to
have
held
nearly
the
same
opinion
in
one
form
or
other
thinking
that
sin
has
arisen
either
from
a
wicked
being
or
from
the
wickedness
of
the
flesh
itself
the
jews
alone
proclaimed
that
god
created
good
and
god
created
evil
but
we
know
of
few
writers
who
have
ever
owned
themselves
manicheans
though
many
have
been
reproached
as
such
their
doctrine
is
now
known
only
in
the
works
written
against
it
of
all
heresies
among
the
christians
this
is
the
one
most
denounced
by
the
ecclesiastical
writers
and
most
severely
threatened
by
the
laws
when
the
law
makers
became
christian
and
of
all
the
accusations
of
the
angry
controversialists
this
was
the
most
reproachful
we
might
almost
think
that
the
numerous
fathers
who
have
written
against
the
manicheans
must
have
had
an
easy
victory
when
the
enemy
never
appeared
in
the
field
when
their
writings
were
scarcely
answered
or
their
arguments
denied
but
perhaps
a
juster
view
would
lead
us
to
remark
how
much
the
writers
as
well
as
the
readers
must
have
felt
the
difficulty
of
accounting
for
the
origin
of
evil
since
men
have
run
into
such
wild
opinions
to
explain
it
another
heresy
which
for
a
time
made
even
as
much
noise
as
the
last
was
that
of
hieracas
of
leontopolis
even
in
egypt
where
for
two
thousand
years
it
had
been
the
custom
to
make
the
bodies
of
the
dead
into
mummies
to
embalm
them
against
the
day
of
resurrection
a
custom
which
had
been
usually
practised
by
the
christians
this
native
egyptian
ventured
to
teach
that
nothing
but
the
soul
would
rise
from
the
dead
and
that
we
must
look
forward
to
only
a
spiritual
resurrection
hieracas
was
a
man
of
some
learning
and
much
to
the
vexation
of
those
who
opposed
his
arguments
he
could
repeat
nearly
the
whole
bible
by

the
bishop
hesychius
the
martyr
in
the
late
persecution
was
one
of
the
learned
men
of
the
time
he
had
published
a
new
edition
of
the
septuagint
old
testament
and
also
of
the
new
testament
this
edition
was
valued
and
chiefly
used
in
egypt
while
that
by
lucianus
who
suffered
in
the
same
persecution
was
read
in
asia
minor
from
constantinople
to
antioch
and
the
older
edition
by
origen
remained
in
use
in
palestine
but
such
was
the
credit
of
alexandria
as
the
chief
seat
of
christian
learning
that
distant
churches
sent
there
for
copies
of
the
scriptures
foreign
translations
were
mostly
made
from
alexandrian
copies
and
the
greater
number
of
christians
even
now
read
the
bible
according
to
the
edition
by
hesychius
we
must
however
fear
that
these
editors
were
by
no
means
judicious
in
their
labours

egypt
from
the
text
itself
we
can
learn
that
the
early
copiers
of
the
bible
thought
those
manuscripts
most
valuable
which
were
most
full
many
a
gloss
and
marginal
note
got
written
into
the
text
their
devotional
feelings
blinded
their
critical
judgment
and
they
never
ventured
to
put
aside
a
modern
addition
as
spurious
this
mistaken
view
of
their
duty
had
of
old
guided
the
hebrew
copiers
in
jerusalem
and
though
in
alexandria
a
juster
criticism
had
been
applied
to
the
copies
of
homer
it
was
not
thought
proper
to
use
the
same
good
sense
when
making
copies
of
the
bible
so
strong
was
the
habit
of
grafting
the
additions
into
the
text
that
the
greek
translation
became
more
copious
than
the
hebrew
original
as
the
latin
soon
afterwards
became
more
copious
than
the
greek
it
was
about
this
time
at
least
after
translation
of
daniel
had
received
the
sanction
of
the
alexandrian
church
and
when
the
teachers
of
christianity
found
willing
hearers
in
every
city
of
egypt
that
the
bible
was
translated
into
the
language
of
the
country
we
have
now
parts
of
several
koptic
versions
they
are
translated
closely
and
nearly
word
by
word
from
the
greek
and

a
people
among
whom
that
language
had
been
spoken

centuries

the
thebaic
and
bashmuric
versions
may
have
been
translated
from
the
edition
by
hesychius
but
the
koptic
version
seems
older
and
its
value
to
the
biblical
critic
is
very
great
as
it
helps
us
with
the
quotations
in
origen
and
clemens
to
distinguish
the
edition
of
the
sacred
text
which
was
then
used
in
alexandria
and
is
shown
in
the
celebrated
vatican
manuscript

later

it
could
not
fail
to
influence
the
train
of
thought
on
the
one
hand
the
political

structure
of

life
was
crumbling

supplied
by

was
thrown
upon

to

the
principles

the
customary
morality
and
religion
had
been
shaken
in
their
foundations
the
belief
in
the
old

and
the
old
religion
was
undermined
philosophy
endeavoured
to
occupy
the
place
left
vacant
by
the
gradual
decay
of
the
national
religion
the
individual
seeking
for
support
and
spiritual
guidance
found
it
or
at
least
imagined
he
had
found
it
in
philosophy
the
conduct
of
life
became
the
fundamental
problem
and
philosophy
assumed
a
practical
aspect
it
aimed
at
finding
a
complete
art
of
living
it
had
a
thoroughly
ethical
stamp
and
became
more
and
more
a
rival
of
and
opposed
to
religion
such
were
the
tendencies
of
the
stoic
and
epicurean
schools
the
roman
rule
was
greatly
favourable
to
such
a
development
of
thought
the
romans
were
a
practical
nation
had
no
conception
of
nor
appreciation
for
purely
theoretical
problems
and
demanded
practical
lessons
and
philosophical
investigations
which
would
serve
as
a
guide
for
life
thus
the
political
tendency
of
the
time
towards
practical
wisdom
had
imparted
a
new
direction
to
philosophical
thought
yet
as
time
went
on
a
deep
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
seized
the
ancient
world
in
the
midst
of
all
the
glories
of
the
roman
rule
this
huge
empire
could
offer
to
the
peoples
which
it
had
welded
into
one
mighty
unit
no
compensation
for
the
loss
of
their
national
independence
it
offered
them
no
inner
worth
nor
outer
fortune
there
was
a
complete
discord
running
through
the
entire
civilisation
of
the
world
the
social
condition
of
the
empire
had
brought
with
it
extreme
contrasts
in
the
daily
life
the
contrasts
had
become
more
pronounced
abundance
and
luxury
existed
side
by
side
with
misery
and
starvation
millions
were
excluded
from
the
very
necessaries
of
existence
with
the
sense
of
injustice
and
revolt
against
the
existing
inequality
of
the
state
of
society
the
hope
for
some
future
compensation
arose
the
millions
excluded
from
the
worldly
possessions
turned
longingly
to
a
better
world
the
thoughts
of
man
were
turned
to
something
beyond
terrestrial
life
to
heaven
instead
of
earth
philosophy
too
had
failed
to
give
complete
satisfaction
man
had
realised
his
utter
inability
to
find
knowledge
in
himself
by
his
unaided
efforts
he
despaired
to
arrive
at
it
without
the
help
of
some
transcendental
power
and
its
kind
assistance
salvation
was
not
to
be
found
in
own
nature
but
in
a
world
beyond
that
of
the
senses
philosophy
could
not
satisfy
the
cultured
man
by
the
presentation
of
its
ethical
ideal
of
life
could
not
secure
for
him
the
promised
happiness
philosophy
therefore
turned
to
religion
for
help
at
alexandria
where
in
the
active
work
of
its
museum
all
treasures
of
grecian
culture
were
garnered
all
religions
and
forms
of
worship
crowded
together
in
the
great
throng
of
the
commercial
metropolis
to
seek
a
scientific
clarification
of
the
feelings
that
surged
and
stormed
within
them
the
cosmopolitan
spirit
and
which
had
brought
nations
together
under
the
egyptian
government
which
had
gathered
scholars
from
all
parts
in
the
library
and
the
museum
was
favourable
also
to
the
fusion
and
reconciliation
in
the
evolution
of
thought
if
alexandria
was
the
birthplace
of
that
intellectual
movement
which
has
been
described
this
was
not
only
the
result
of
the
prevailing
spirit
of
the
age
but
was
due
to
the
influence
of
ideas
salvation
could
only
be
found
in
the
reconciliation
of
ideas
the
geographical
centre
of
this
movement
of
fusion
and
reconciliation
was
however
in
alexandria
after
having
been
the
town
of
the
museum
and
the
library
of
criticism
and
literary
erudition
alexandria
became
once
again
the
of
philosophical
schools
and
religious
sects
communication
had
become
easier
and
various
fundamentally
different
inhabitants
belonging
to
distinct
social
groups
met
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
not
only
goods
and
products
of
the
soil
were
exchanged
but
also
ideas
and
thoughts
the
mental
horizon
was
widened
comparisons
ensued
and
new
ideas
were
suggested
and
formed
this
mixture
of
ideas
necessarily
created
a
complex
spirit
where
two
currents
of
thought
of
critical
scepticism
and
superstitious
credulity
mixed
and
mingled
another
powerful
factor
was
the
close
contact
in
which
occidentalism
or
greek
culture
found
itself
with
orientalism
here
it
was
where
the
greek
and
oriental
spirit
mixed
and
mingled
producing
doctrines
and
religious
systems
containing
germs
of
tradition
and
science
of
inspiration
and
reflection
images
and
formulas
method
and
ecstasy
were
interwoven
and
intertwined
the
brilliant
qualities
of
the
greek
spirit
its
sagacity
and
subtlety
of
intelligence
its
lucidity
and
facility
of
expression
were
animated
and
vivified
by
the
oriental
spark
and
gained
new
life
and
vigour
on
the
other
hand
the
contemplative
spirit
of
the
orient
which
is
characterised
by
its
aspiration
towards
the
invisible
and
mysterious
would
never
have
produced
a
coherent
system
or
theory
had
it
not
been
aided
by
greek
science
it
was
the
latter
that
arranged
and
explained
the
oriental
traditions
loosed
their
tongues
and
produced
those
religious
doctrines
and
philosophical
systems
which
culminated
in
gnosticism
the
judaism
of
philo
and
the
polytheism
of
julian
the
apostate
it
was
the
contemplative
oriental
mind
with
its
tendency
towards
the
supernatural
and
miraculous
with
its
mysticism
and
religion
and
greece
with
her
subtle
scrutinising
and
investigating
spirit
which
gave
rise
to
the
peculiar
phase
of
thought
prevalent
in
alexandria
during
the
first
centuries
of
our
era
it
was
tinctured
with
idealistic
mystic
and
yet
speculative
and
scientific
colours
hence
the
religious
spirit
in
philosophy
and
the
philosophic
tendency
in
the
religious
system
that
are
the
characteristic
features
and
west
says
baldwin
at
the
ideas
of
civilisations
cultures
and
religions
of
rome
greece
palestine
and
the
farther
east
found
themselves
in
juxtaposition
hence
arose
a
new
problem
developed
partly
by
occidental
thought
partly
by
oriental
aspiration
religion
and
philosophy
became
inextricably
mixed
and
the
resultant
doctrines
consequently
belong
to
neither
sphere
proper
but
are
rather
witnesses
of
an
attempt
at
combining
both
baldwin
dictionary
of
philosophy
these
efforts
naturally
came
from
two
sides
on
the
one
hand
the
jews
tried
to
accommodate
their
faith
to
the
results
of
western
culture
in
which
greek
culture
predominated
on
the
other
hand
thinkers
whose
main
impulse
came
from
greek
philosophy
attempted
to
accommodate
their
doctrines
to
the
distinctively
religious
problems
which
the
eastern
nations
had
brought
with
them
from
whichever
side
the
consequences
be
viewed
they
are
to
be
characterised
as
theosophical
rather
than
purely
philosophical
purely
religious
or
purely
theological
the
reign
of
constantine
the
great
who
became
sole
ruler
of
the
east
and
west
in
after
ten
joint
government
with
licinius
is
remarkable
for
the
change
which
was
then
wrought
in
the
religion
and
philosophy
of
the
empire
by
the
embracing
the
christian
faith
his
conversion
occurred
in
and
on
his
coming
to
the
united
sovereignty
the
christians
were
at
once
released
from
every
punishment
and
disability
on
account
of
their
religion
which
was
then
more
than
tolerated
they
were
put
upon
a
nearly
equal
footing
with
the
pagans
and
every
minister
of
the
church
was
released
from
the
burden
of
civil
and
military
duties
whether
the
conversion
arose
from
education
from
conviction
or
from
state
policy
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
christianity
did
not
reach
the
throne
before
it
was
the
religion
of
a
most
important
class
of
his
subjects
and
the
egyptian
christians
soon
found
themselves
numerous
enough
to
call
the
greek
christians
heretics
as
the
greek
christians
had
already
begun
to
designate
the
jewish
the
greeks
of
alexandria
had
formed
rather
a
school
of
philosophy
than
a
religious
sect
before
conquest
the
greek
settlers
at
naucratis
had
thought
it
necessary
to
have
their
own
temples
and
sacrifices
but
since
the
building
of
alexandria
they
had
been
smitten
with
the
love
of
eastern
mysticism
and
content
to
worship
in
the
temples
of
serapis
and
mithra
and
to
receive
instruction
from
the
egyptian
priests
they
had
supported
the
religion
of
the
conquered
egyptians
without
wholly
believing
it
and
had
shaken
by
their
ridicule
the
respect
for
the
very
ceremonies
which
they
upheld
by
law
polytheism
among
the
greeks
had
been
further
shaken
by
the
platonists
and
christianity
spread
in
about
equal
proportions
among
the
greeks
and
the
egyptians
before
the
conversion
of
constantine
the
egyptian
church
had
already
spread
into
every
city
of
the
province
and
had
a
regular
episcopal
government
till
the
time
of
heraclas
and
dionysius
the
bishops
had
been
always
chosen
by
the
votes
of
the
presbyters
as
the
archdeacons
were
by
the
deacons
dionysius
in
his
public
epistles
joins
with
himself
his
as
if
he
were
only
the
first
among
equals
but
after
that
time
some
irregularities
had
crept
into
the
elections
and
latterly
the
church
had
become
more
monarchical
there
was
a
patriarch
in
alexandria
with
a
bishop
in
every
other
large
city
each
assisted
by
a
body
of
priests
and
deacons
they
had
been
clad
in
faith
holiness
humility
and
charity
but
constantine
robed
them
in
honour
wealth
and
power
and
to
this
many
of
them
soon
added
pride
avarice
and
ambition
this
reign
is
no
less
remarkable
for
the
religious
quarrel
which
then
divided
the
christians
which
set
church
against
church
and
bishop
against
bishop
as
soon
as
they
lost
that
great
bond
of
union
the
fear
of
the
pagans
jesus
of
nazareth
was
acknowledged
by
constantine
as
a
divine
person
and
in
the
attempt
then
made
by
the
alexandrians
to
arrive
at
a
more
exact
definition
of
his
nature
while
the
emperor
was
willing
to
be
guided
by
the
bishops
in
his
theological
opinions
he
was
able
to
instruct
them
all
in
the
more
valuable
lessons
of
mutual
toleration
and
forbearance
the
followers
of
early
religions
held
different
opinions
but
distinguished
themselves
apart
only
by
outward
modes
of
worship
such
as
by
sacrifices
among
the
greeks
and
romans
and
among
the
jews
and
egyptians
by
circumcision
and
abstinence
from
certain
meats
when
jesus
of
nazareth
introduced
his
spiritual
religion
of
repentance
and
amendment
of
life
he
taught
that
the
test
by
which
his
disciples
wrere
to
be
known
was
their
love
to
one
another
after
his
death
however
the
christians
gave
more
importance
to
opinions
in
religion
and
towards
the
end
of
the
third
century
they
proposed
to
distinguish
their
in
a
mode
hitherto
unknown
to
the
world
namely
by
the
profession
of
belief
in
certain
opinions
for
as
yet
there
was
no
difference
in
their
belief
of
historic
facts
this
gave
rise
to
numerous
metaphysical
discussions
particularly
among
the
more
speculative
and
mystical
at
about
this
time
the
chief
controversy
was
as
to
whether
christ
was
of
the
or
of
substance
with
god
the
father
this
being
the
dispute
which
divided
christendom
for
centuries
this
dispute
and
others
not
quite
so
metaphysical
were
brought
to
the
ears
of
the
emperor
by
alexander
bishop
of
alexandria
and
arius
the
presbyter
the
bishop
had
been
enquiring
into
the
belief
of
the
presbyter
and
the
latter
had
argued
against
his
superior
and
against
the
doctrine
of
the
of
the
father
and
the
son
the
letter
to
the
theologians
in
this
first
ecclesiastical
quarrel
that
was
ever
brought
before
a
christian
monarch
is
addressed
to
alexander
and
arius
and
he
therein
tells
them
that
they
are
raising
useless
questions
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
settle
and
which
though
a
good
exercise
for
the
understanding
only
breed
and
should
be
kept
by
each
man
in
his
own
breast
he
regrets
the
religious
madness
which
has
seized
all
egypt
and
lastly
he
orders
the
bishop
not
to
question
the
priest
as
to
his
belief
and
orders
the
priest
if
questioned
not
to
return
an
answer
but
this
wise
letter
had
no
weight
with
the
alexandrian
divines
the
quarrel
gained
in
importance
from
being
noticed
by
the
emperor
the
civil
government
of
the
country
was
clogged
and
constantine
after
having
once
interfered
was
persuaded
to
call
a
council
of
bishops
to
settle
the
christian
faith
for
the
future
nicæa
in
bithynia
was
chosen
as
the
spot
most
convenient
for
eastern
christendom
to
meet
in
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
bishops
followed
by
crowds
of
priests
there
met
in
council
from
greece
thrace
asia
minor
syria
arabia
egypt
and
libya
with
one
or
two
from
western
europe
at
this
synod
held
in
the
year
athanasius
a
young
deacon
in
the
alexandrian
church
came
for
the
first
time
into
notice
as
the
champion
of
alexander
against
arius
who
was
then
placed
upon
his
trial
all
the
authority
eloquence
and
charity
of
the
emperor
were
needed
to
quell
the
tumultuous
passions
of
the
assembly
it
ended
its
stormy
labours
by
voting
what
was
called
the
homoousian
doctrine
that
jesus
was
of
one
substance
with
god
they
put
forth
to
the
world
the
celebrated
creed
named
from
the
city
in
which
they
met
the
nicene
creed
and
they
excommunicated
arius
and
his
followers
who
were
then
all
banished
by
the
emperor
the
meeting
had
afterwards
less
difficulty
in
coming
to
an
agreement
about
the
true
time
of
easter
and
in
excommunicating
the
jews
and
all
except
the
egyptians
returned
home
with
a
wish
that
the
quarrel
should
be
forgotten
and
forgiven
this
first
attempt
among
the
christians
at
settling
the
true
faith
by
putting
fetters
on
the
mind
by
drawing
up
a
creed
and
punishing
those
that
disbelieved
it
was
but
the
beginning
of
theological
difficulties
these
in
egypt
arose
as
much
from
the
difference
of
blood
and
language
of
the
races
that
inhabited
the
country
as
from
their
religious
belief
and
constantine
must
soon
have
seen
that
if
as
a
theologian
he
had
decided
right
yet
as
a
statesman
he
had
been
helping
the
egyptians
against
the
friends
of
his
own
greek
government
in
alexandria
after
a
reasonable
delay
arius
addressed
to
the
emperor
a
letter
either
of
explanation
or
apology
asserting
his
full
belief
in
christianity
explaining
his
faith
by
using
the
words
of
the
creed
and
begging
to
be
into
the
church
the
emperor
either
from
a
readiness
to
forgive
or
from
a
change
of
policy
or
from
an
ignorance
of
the
theological
controversy
was
satisfied
with
the
apology
and
thereupon
wrote
a
mild
conciliatory
letter
to
athanasius
who
had
in
the
meantime
been
made
bishop
of
alexandria
expressing
his
wish
that
forgiveness
should
at
all
times
be
offered
to
the
repentant
and
ordering
him
to
arius
to
his
rank
in
the
church
but
the
young
athanasius
who
had
gained
his
favour
with
the
egyptian
clergy
and
had
been
raised
to
his
high
seat
by
his
zeal
shown
against
arius
refused
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
emperor
alleging
that
it
was
unlawful
to
into
the
church
anybody
who
had
once
been
excommunicated
constantine
could
hardly
be
expected
to
listen
to
this
excuse
or
to
overlook
this
direct
refusal
to
obey
his
orders
the
rebellious
athanasius
was
ordered
into
the
presence
at
constantinople
and
soon
afterwards
in
called
before
a
council
of
bishops
at
tyre
where
he
was
deposed
and
banished
at
the
same
council
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
this
reign
arius
was
into
communion
with
the
church
and
after
a
few
months
he
was
allowed
to
return
to
alexandria
to
the
indignation
of
the
popular
party
in
that
city
while
athanasius
remained
in
banishment
during
the
rest
of
the
reign
as
a
punishment
for
his
disobedience
this
practice
of
judging
and
condemning
opinions
gave
power
in
the
church
to
men
who
would
otherwise
have
been
least
entitled
to
weight
and
influence
athanasius
rose
to
his
high
rank
over
the
heads
of
the
elder
presbyters
by
his
fitness
for
the
harsher
duties
then
required
of
an
archbishop
theological
opinions
became
the
watchwords
of
two
contending
parties
religion
lost
much
of
its
empire
over
the
heart
and
the
mild
spirit
of
christianity
gave
way
to
angry
quarrels
and
cruel
persecutions
another
remarkable
event
of
this
reign
was
the
foundation
of
the
new
city
of
constantinople
to
which
the
emperor
removed
the
seat
of
his
government
rome
lost
much
by
the
building
of
the
new
capital
although
the
emperors
had
for
some
time
past
ceased
to
live
in
italy
but
alexandria
lost
the
rank
which
it
had
long
held
as
the
centre
of
greek
learning
and
greek
thought
and
it
felt
a
blow
from
which
rome
was
saved
by
the
difference
of
language
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
was
no
longer
the
head
of
greek
christendom
that
rank
was
granted
to
the
bishop
of
the
imperial
city
many
of
the
philosophers
who
hung
round
the
palace
at
constantinople
would
otherwise
have
studied
and
taught
in
the
museum
and
the
greeks
by
whose
superiority
egypt
had
so
long
been
kept
in
subjection
gradually
became
the
weaker
party
in
the
opinion
of
the
historian
as
in
the
map
of
the
geographer
alexandria
had
formerly
been
a
greek
state
on
the
borders
of
egypt
but
since
the
rebellion
in
the
reign
of
diocletian
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
an
egyptian
city
and
those
who
in
religion
and
politics
thought
and
felt
as
egyptians
soon
formed
the
larger
half
of
the
alexandrians
the
climate
of
egypt
was
hardly
fitted
for
the
greek
race
their
numbers
never
could
have
been
kept
up
by
births
alone
and
they
now
began
to
lessen
as
the
attraction
to
newcomers
ceased
the
pure
greek
names
henceforth
become
less
common
and
among
the
monks
and
writers
we
now
meet
with
those
named
after
the
old
gods
of
the
country
illustration
the
island
of
rhodha
constantine
removed
an
obelisk
from
egypt
for
the
ornament
of
his
new
city
and
he
brought
down
another
from
heliopolis
to
alexandria
but
he
died
before
the
second
left
the
country
and
it
was
afterwards
taken
by
his
son
to
rome
these
obelisks
were
covered
with
hieroglyphics
as
usual
and
we
have
a
translation
said
to
be
made
from
the
latter
by
hermapion
an
egyptian
priest
in
order
to
take
away
its
pagan
character
from
the
religious
ceremony
with
which
the
yearly
rise
of
the
nile
wras
celebrated
in
alexandria
constantine
removed
the
sacred
cubit
from
the
temple
of
serapis
to
one
of
the
christian
churches
and
nothwithstanding
the
gloomy
forebodings
of
the
people
the
nile
rose
as
usual
and
the
clergy
afterwards
celebrated
the
time
of
its
overflow
as
a
christian
festival
the
pagan
philosophers
under
constantine
had
but
few
pupils
and
met
with
but
little
encouragement
alypius
of
alexandria
and
his
friend
iamblichus
however
still
taught
the
philosophy
of
ammonius
and
plotinus
the
only
writings
by
alypius
now
remaining
are
his
to
in
which
he
explains
the
notation
of
the
fifteen
modes
or
tones
in
their
respective
kinds
of
diatonic
chromatic
and
enharmonic
his
signs
are
said
to
be
pythagorean
they
are
in
pairs
of
which
one
is
thought
to
represent
the
note
struck
on
the
lyre
and
the
other
the
tone
of
the
voice
to
be
sung
thereto
they
thus
imply
accord
or
harmony
the
same
signs
are
found
in
some
manuscripts
written
over
the
syllables
of
ancient
poems
and
thereby
scholars
learned
at
once
in
the
greek
language
in
the
art
of
deciphering
signs
and
in
the
science
of
music
now
chant
the
odes
of
pindar
in
strains
not
dissimilar
to
modern
cathedral
psalmody
sopator
succeeded
iamblichus
as
professor
of
platonism
in
alexandria
with
the
proud
title
of
successor
to
plato
for
some
time
he
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
constantine
but
when
religion
made
a
quarrel
between
the
friends
the
philosopher
was
put
to
death
by
the
emperor
the
pagan
account
of
the
quarrel
was
that
when
constantine
had
killed
his
son
he
applied
to
sopator
to
be
purified
from
his
guilt
and
when
the
platonist
answered
that
he
knew
of
no
ceremony
that
could
absolve
a
man
from
such
a
crime
the
emperor
applied
to
the
christians
for
baptism
this
story
may
not
be
true
and
the
ecclesiastical
historian
remarks
that
constantine
had
professed
christianity
several
years
before
the
murder
of
his
son
but
then
as
after
his
conversion
he
had
got
sopator
to
consecrate
his
new
city
with
a
variety
of
pagan
ceremonies
he
may
in
the
same
way
have
asked
him
to
absolve
him
from
the
guilt
of
murder
on
the
death
of
constantine
in
his
three
sons
without
entirely
dismembering
the
empire
divided
the
provinces
of
the
roman
world
into
three
shares
constantine
the
eldest
son
who
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
his
father
in
constantinople
and
constans
the
youngest
who
dwelt
in
rome
divided
europe
between
them
while
constantius
the
second
son
held
syria
mesopotamia
armenia
and
egypt
of
which
possessions
antioch
on
the
orontes
was
at
that
time
the
capital
thus
alexandria
was
doomed
to
a
further
fall
when
governed
by
rome
it
had
still
been
the
first
of
greek
cities
afterwards
when
the
seat
of
the
empire
was
fixed
at
constantinople
it
became
the
second
but
on
this
division
of
the
roman
world
when
the
seat
of
government
came
still
nearer
to
egypt
and
antioch
rose
as
the
capital
of
the
east
alexandria
fell
to
be
the
third
among
greek
cities
egypt
quietly
received
its
political
orders
from
antioch
its
opinions
also
in
some
cases
followed
those
of
the
capital
and
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
the
alexandrian
writers
when
dating
by
the
era
of
the
creation
were
now
willing
to
consider
the
world
ten
years
less
old
than
they
used
because
it
was
so
thought
at
antioch
but
it
was
not
so
with
their
religious
opinions
and
as
long
as
antioch
and
its
emperor
undertook
to
govern
the
egyptian
church
there
was
little
peace
in
the
province
the
three
emperors
did
not
take
the
same
side
in
the
quarrel
which
under
the
name
of
religion
was
then
unsettling
the
obedience
of
the
egyptians
and
even
in
some
degree
troubling
the
rest
of
the
empire
constantius
held
the
arian
opinions
of
syria
but
constantine
ii
and
constans
openly
gave
their
countenance
to
the
party
of
the
rebellious
athanasius
who
under
their
favour
ventured
to
return
to
alexandria
where
after
an
absence
of
two
years
and
four
months
he
was
received
in
the
warmest
manner
by
his
admiring
flock
but
on
the
death
of
constantine
who
was
shortly
afterwards
killed
in
battle
by
his
brother
constans
constantius
felt
himself
more
master
of
his
own
kingdom
he
deposed
athanasius
and
summoned
a
council
of
bishops
at
antioch
to
elect
a
new
patriarch
of
alexandria
christian
bishops
though
they
had
latterly
owed
their
ordination
to
the
authority
of
their
equals
had
always
received
their
bishoprics
by
the
choice
of
their
presbyters
or
of
their
flocks
and
though
they
were
glad
to
receive
the
support
of
the
emperor
they
were
not
willing
to
acknowledge
him
as
their
head
hence
when
the
council
at
antioch
first
elected
eusebius
of
æmisa
into
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
he
chose
to
refuse
the
honour
which
they
had
only
a
doubtful
right
to
bestow
rather
than
to
venture
into
the
city
in
the
face
of
his
popular
rival
the
council
then
elected
gregory
whose
greater
courage
and
ambition
led
him
to
accept
the
office
the
council
of
antioch
then
made
some
changes
in
the
creed
a
few
years
later
a
second
council
met
in
the
same
place
and
drew
up
a
creed
more
near
to
what
we
now
call
the
athanasian
but
it
was
firmly
rejected
by
the
egyptian
and
roman
churches
gregory
was
no
sooner
elected
to
the
bishopric
than
he
issued
his
commands
as
bishop
though
if
he
had
the
courage
he
had
not
at
the
time
the
power
to
enter
alexandria
but
syrianus
the
general
of
the
egyptian
troops
was
soon
afterwards
ordered
by
the
emperor
to
place
him
on
his
episcopal
throne
and
he
led
him
into
the
city
surrounded
by
the
spears
of
five
thousand
soldiers
and
followed
by
the
small
body
of
alexandrians
that
after
this
invasion
of
their
acknowledged
rights
still
called
themselves
arians
gregory
entered
alexandria
in
the
evening
meaning
to
take
his
seat
in
the
church
on
the
next
day
but
the
people
in
their
zeal
did
not
wait
quietly
for
the
dreaded
morning
they
ran
at
once
to
the
church
and
passed
the
night
there
with
athanasius
in
the
greatest
anxiety
in
the
morning
when
gregory
arrived
at
the
church
accompanied
with
the
troops
he
found
the
doors
barricaded
and
the
building
full
of
men
and
women
denouncing
the
sacrilege
and
threatening
resistance
but
the
general
gave
orders
that
the
church
should
be
stormed
and
the
new
bishop
carried
in
by
force
of
arms
and
athanasius
seeing
that
all
resistance
was
useless
ordered
the
deacons
to
give
out
a
psalm
and
they
all
marched
out
at
the
opposite
door
singing
after
these
acts
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
troops
and
of
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
people
the
whole
city
was
thrown
into
an
uproar
and
the
prefect
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
carry
on
the
government
the
regular
supply
of
grain
for
the
poor
citizens
of
alexandria
and
for
constantinople
was
stopped
and
the
blame
of
the
whole
thrown
upon
athanasius
he
was
a
second
time
obliged
to
leave
egypt
and
he
fled
to
rome
where
he
was
warmly
received
by
the
emperor
constans
and
the
roman
bishop
but
the
zeal
of
the
athanasian
party
would
not
allow
gregory
to
keep
possession
of
the
church
which
he
had
gained
only
by
force
they
soon
afterwards
set
fire
to
it
and
burned
it
to
the
ground
choosing
that
there
should
be
no
church
at
all
rather
than
that
it
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
arians
and
the
arian
clergy
and
bishops
though
supported
by
the
favour
of
the
emperor
and
the
troops
of
the
prefect
were
everywhere
throughout
egypt
driven
from
their
churches
and
monasteries
during
this
quarrel
it
seems
to
have
been
felt
by
both
parties
that
the
choice
of
the
people
or
at
least
of
the
clergy
was
necessary
to
make
a
bishop
and
that
gregory
had
very
little
claim
to
that
rank
in
alexandria
julius
the
bishop
of
rome
warmly
espoused
the
cause
of
athanasius
and
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
alexandrian
church
praising
their
zeal
for
their
bishop
and
ordering
them
to
him
to
his
former
rank
from
which
he
had
been
deposed
by
the
council
of
antioch
but
to
which
he
had
been
restored
by
the
western
bishops
athanasius
was
also
warmly
supported
by
constans
the
emperor
of
the
west
who
at
the
same
time
wrote
to
his
brother
constantius
begging
him
to
replace
the
alexandrian
bishop
and
making
the
additional
threat
that
if
he
would
not
reinstate
him
he
should
be
made
to
do
so
by
force
of
arms
constantius
after
taking
the
advice
of
his
own
bishops
thought
it
wisest
to
yield
to
the
wishes
or
rather
the
commands
of
his
brother
constans
and
he
wrote
to
athanasius
calling
him
into
his
presence
in
constantinople
but
the
rebellious
bishop
was
not
willing
to
trust
himself
within
the
reach
of
his
offended
sovereign
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
second
and
a
third
letter
pressing
him
to
come
and
promising
him
his
safety
that
he
ventured
within
the
limits
of
the
eastern
empire
strong
in
his
high
character
for
learning
firmness
and
political
skill
carrying
with
him
the
allegiance
of
the
egyptian
nation
which
was
yielded
to
him
much
rather
than
to
the
emperor
and
backed
by
the
threats
of
constans
athanasius
was
at
least
a
match
for
constantius
at
constantinople
the
emperor
and
his
subject
the
alexandrian
bishop
made
a
formal
treaty
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
if
constantius
would
allow
the
homoousian
clergy
throughout
his
dominions
to
return
to
their
churches
athanasius
would
in
the
same
way
throughout
egypt
restore
the
arian
clergy
and
upon
this
agreement
athanasius
himself
returned
to
alexandria
among
the
followers
of
athanasius
was
that
important
mixed
race
with
whom
the
egyptian
civilisation
chiefly
rested
a
race
that
may
be
called
koptic
but
half
greek
and
half
egyptian
in
their
language
and
religion
as
in
their
forefathers
but
in
feelings
they
were
wholly
opposed
to
the
greeks
of
alexandria
never
since
the
last
nectanebo
was
conquered
by
the
persians
eight
hundred
years
earlier
did
the
egyptians
seem
so
near
to
throwing
off
the
foreign
yoke
and
rising
again
as
an
independent
nation
but
the
greeks
who
had
taught
them
so
much
had
not
taught
them
the
arts
of
war
and
the
nation
remained
enslaved
to
those
who
could
wield
the
sword
the
return
of
athanasius
however
was
only
the
signal
for
a
fresh
uproar
and
the
arians
complained
that
egypt
was
kept
in
a
constant
turmoil
by
his
zealous
activity
nor
were
the
arians
his
only
enemies
he
had
offended
many
others
of
his
clergy
by
his
overbearing
manners
and
more
particularly
by
his
following
in
the
steps
of
alexander
the
late
bishop
in
claiming
new
and
higher
powers
for
the
office
of
patriarch
than
had
ever
been
yielded
to
the
bishops
of
alexandria
before
their
spiritual
rank
had
been
changed
into
civil
rank
by
the
adoption
of
their
religion
meletius
headed
a
strong
party
of
bishops
priests
and
deacons
in
opposing
the
new
claims
of
the
archiepiscopal
see
of
alexandria
his
followers
differed
in
no
point
of
doctrine
from
the
athanasian
party
but
as
they
sided
with
the
arians
they
were
usually
called
heretics
by
this
time
the
statesmen
and
magistrates
had
gained
a
clear
view
of
the
change
which
had
come
over
the
political
state
of
the
empire
first
by
the
spread
of
christianity
and
secondly
by
the
embracing
it
by
supporting
christianity
the
emperors
gave
rank
in
the
state
to
an
organised
and
body
which
immediately
found
itself
in
possession
of
all
the
civil
power
a
bishopric
which
a
few
years
before
was
a
post
of
danger
was
now
a
place
of
great
profit
and
secured
to
its
possessor
every
worldly
advantage
of
wealth
honour
and
power
an
archbishop
in
the
capital
obeyed
by
a
bishop
in
every
city
with
numerous
priests
and
deacons
under
them
was
usually
of
more
weight
than
the
prefect
while
athanasius
was
at
the
height
of
his
popularity
in
egypt
and
was
supported
by
the
emperor
of
the
west
the
emperor
constantius
was
very
far
from
being
his
master
but
on
the
death
of
constans
when
constantius
became
sovereign
of
the
whole
empire
he
once
more
tried
to
make
alexandria
and
the
egyptian
church
obedient
to
his
wishes
he
was
however
still
doubtful
how
far
it
was
prudent
to
measure
his
strength
against
that
of
the
bishop
and
he
chose
rather
to
begin
privately
with
threats
before
using
his
power
openly
he
first
wrote
word
to
athanasius
as
if
in
answer
to
a
request
from
the
bishop
that
he
was
at
liberty
if
he
wished
to
visit
italy
but
he
sent
the
letter
by
the
hands
of
the
notary
diogenes
who
added
by
word
of
mouth
that
the
permission
was
meant
for
a
command
and
that
it
was
the
pleasure
that
he
should
immediately
quit
his
bishopric
and
the
province
but
this
underhand
conduct
of
the
emperor
only
showed
his
own
weakness
athanasius
steadily
refused
to
obey
any
unwritten
orders
and
held
his
bishopric
for
upwards
of
two
years
longer
before
constantius
felt
strong
enough
to
enforce
his
wishes
towards
the
end
of
that
time
syrianus
the
general
of
the
egyptian
army
to
whom
this
delicate
task
was
entrusted
gathered
together
from
other
parts
of
the
province
a
body
of
five
thousand
chosen
men
and
with
these
he
marched
quietly
into
alexandria
to
overawe
if
possible
the
rebellious
bishop
he
gave
out
no
reason
for
his
conduct
but
the
arians
who
were
in
the
secret
openly
boasted
that
it
would
soon
be
their
turn
to
possess
the
churches
syrianus
then
sent
for
athanasius
and
in
the
presence
of
maximus
the
prefect
again
delivered
to
him
the
command
of
constantius
that
he
should
quit
egypt
and
retire
into
banishment
and
he
threatened
to
carry
this
command
into
execution
by
the
help
of
the
troops
if
he
met
with
any
resistance
athanasius
without
refusing
to
obey
begged
to
be
shown
the
orders
in
writing
but
this
reasonable
request
was
refused
he
then
entreated
them
even
to
give
him
in
their
own
handwriting
an
order
for
his
banishment
but
this
was
also
refused
and
the
citizens
who
were
made
acquainted
with
the
wishes
and
the
firmness
waited
in
dreadful
anxiety
to
see
whether
the
prefect
and
the
general
would
venture
to
enforce
their
orders
the
presbytery
of
the
church
and
the
corporation
of
the
city
went
up
to
syrianus
in
solemn
procession
to
beg
him
either
to
show
a
written
authority
for
the
banishment
of
their
bishop
or
to
write
to
constantinople
to
learn
the
pleasure
to
this
request
syrianus
at
last
yielded
and
gave
his
word
to
the
friends
of
athanasius
that
he
would
take
no
further
steps
till
the
return
of
the
messengers
which
he
then
sent
to
constantinople
but
syrianus
had
before
received
his
orders
which
were
if
possible
to
frighten
athanasius
into
obedience
and
if
that
could
not
be
done
then
to
employ
force
but
not
to
expose
the
written
commands
to
the
danger
of
being
successfully
resisted
he
therefore
only
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
carrying
them
into
effect
and
at
midnight
on
the
ninth
of
february
days
after
the
promise
had
been
given
syrianus
at
the
head
of
his
troops
armed
for
the
assault
surrounded
the
church
where
athanasius
and
a
crowded
assembly
were
at
prayers
the
doors
were
forcibly
and
suddenly
broken
open
the
armed
soldiers
rushed
forward
to
seize
the
bishop
and
numbers
of
his
faithful
friends
were
slain
in
their
efforts
to
save
him
athanasius
however
escaped
in
the
tumult
but
though
the
general
was
unsuccessful
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
the
arms
of
the
soldiers
found
scattered
through
the
church
in
the
morning
were
full
proofs
of
his
unholy
attempt
the
friends
of
the
bishop
drew
up
and
signed
a
public
declaration
describing
the
outrage
and
syrianus
sent
to
constantinople
a
declaring
that
there
had
been
no
disturbance
in
the
city
athanasius
with
nearly
the
whole
of
the
nation
for
his
friends
easily
escaped
the
vengeance
of
the
emperor
and
withdrawing
for
a
third
time
from
public
life
he
passed
the
remainder
of
this
reign
in
concealment
he
did
not
however
neglect
the
interests
of
his
flock
he
encouraged
them
with
his
letters
and
even
privately
visited
his
friends
in
alexandria
as
the
greater
part
of
the
population
was
eager
to
befriend
him
he
was
there
able
to
hide
himself
for
six
years
disregarding
the
scandal
that
might
arise
from
it
he
lived
in
the
house
of
a
young
woman
who
concealed
him
in
her
chamber
and
waited
on
him
with
untiring
zeal
she
was
then
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
only
twenty
years
of
age
and
fifty
years
afterwards
in
the
reign
of
theodosius
when
the
name
of
the
archbishop
ranked
with
those
of
the
apostles
this
woman
used
to
boast
among
the
monks
of
alexandria
that
in
her
youth
she
had
for
six
years
concealed
the
great
athanasius
but
though
the
general
was
not
wholly
successful
yet
the
athanasian
party
was
for
the
time
crushed
sebastianus
the
new
prefect
was
sent
into
egypt
with
orders
to
seize
athanasius
dead
or
alive
wherever
he
should
be
found
within
the
province
and
under
his
protection
the
arian
party
in
alexandria
again
ventured
to
meet
in
public
and
proceeded
to
choose
a
bishop
they
elected
to
this
high
position
the
celebrated
george
of
cappadocia
a
man
who
while
he
equalled
his
more
popular
rival
in
learning
and
in
ambition
fell
far
behind
him
in
coolness
of
judgment
and
in
that
political
skill
which
is
as
much
wanted
in
the
guidance
of
a
religious
party
as
in
the
government
of
an
empire
george
was
born
at
epiphania
in
cilicia
and
was
the
son
of
a
clothier
but
his
ambition
led
him
into
the
church
as
being
at
that
time
the
fairest
field
for
the
display
of
talent
and
he
rose
from
one
station
to
another
till
he
reached
the
high
post
of
bishop
of
alexandria
the
fickle
irritable
alexandrians
needed
no
such
firebrand
to
light
up
the
flames
of
discontent
george
took
no
pains
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
held
his
bishopric
by
the
favour
of
the
emperor
and
the
power
of
the
army
against
the
wishes
of
his
flock
to
support
his
authority
he
opened
his
doors
to
informers
of
the
worst
description
anybody
who
stood
in
the
way
of
his
grasp
at
power
was
accused
of
being
an
enemy
to
the
emperor
he
proposed
to
the
emperor
to
lay
a
on
alexandria
thereby
to
repay
the
expense
incurred
by
alexander
the
great
in
building
the
city
and
he
made
the
imperial
government
more
unpopular
than
it
had
ever
been
since
augustus
landed
in
egypt
he
used
the
army
as
the
means
of
terrifying
the
homoousians
into
an
acknowledgment
of
the
arian
opinions
he
banished
fifteen
bishops
to
the
great
oasis
besides
others
of
lower
rank
he
beat
tortured
and
put
to
death
the
persecution
was
more
cruel
than
any
suffered
from
the
pagans
except
perhaps
that
in
the
reign
of
diocletian
and
thirty
egyptian
bishops
are
said
to
have
lost
their
lives
while
george
was
patriarch
of
alexandria
most
of
these
accusations
however
are
from
the
pens
of
his
enemies
at
this
time
the
countries
at
the
southern
end
of
the
red
sea
were
becoming
a
little
more
known
to
alexandria
meropius
travelling
in
the
reign
of
constantine
for
curiosity
and
the
sake
of
knowledge
had
visited
auxum
the
capital
of
the
hexumito
in
abyssinia
his
companion
frumentius
undertook
to
convert
the
people
to
christianity
and
persuade
them
to
trade
with
egypt
and
as
he
found
them
willing
to
listen
to
his
arguments
he
came
home
to
alexandria
to
tell
of
his
success
and
ask
for
support
athanasius
readily
entered
into
a
plan
for
spreading
the
blessings
of
christianity
and
the
power
of
the
alexandrian
church
to
increase
the
weight
he
consecrated
him
a
bishop
and
sent
him
back
to
auxum
to
continue
his
good
work
his
progress
however
was
somewhat
checked
by
sectarian
jealousy
for
when
athanasius
was
deposed
by
constantius
frumentius
was
recalled
to
receive
again
his
orders
and
his
opinions
from
the
new
patriarch
constantius
also
sent
an
embassy
to
the
homeritse
on
the
opposite
coast
of
arabia
under
theophilus
a
monk
and
deacon
in
the
church
the
homerito
were
of
jewish
blood
though
of
gentile
faith
and
were
readily
converted
if
not
to
christianity
at
least
to
friendship
with
the
emperor
after
consecrating
their
churches
theophilus
crossed
over
to
the
african
coast
to
the
hexumito
to
carry
on
the
work
which
frumentius
had
begun
there
he
was
equally
successful
in
the
object
of
his
embassy
both
in
trade
and
in
religion
the
hexumito
who
were
also
of
jewish
blood
were
eager
to
be
connected
with
the
europeans
from
whom
they
were
cut
off
by
arabs
of
a
wilder
race
he
found
also
a
little
to
the
south
of
auxum
a
settlement
of
syrians
who
were
said
to
have
been
placed
there
by
alexander
the
great
these
tribes
spoke
the
language
called
ethiopie
a
dialect
of
arabic
which
was
not
used
in
the
country
which
we
have
hitherto
called
ethiopia
illustration
temple
of
abu
simbel
in
nubia
the
ethiopie
version
of
the
bible
was
about
this
time
made
for
their
use
it
was
translated
out
of
the
greek
from
the
alexandrian
copies
as
the
greek
version
was
held
in
such
value
that
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
look
to
the
hebrew
original
of
the
old
testament
but
these
efforts
did
little
at
the
time
towards
making
the
hexumitæ
christians
distance
and
the
blemmyes
checked
their
intercourse
with
alexandria
it
was
not
till
two
hundred
years
later
that
they
could
be
said
in
the
slightest
sense
to
be
converted
to
christianity
though
the
origin
of
monastic
life
has
sometimes
been
claimed
for
the
essenes
on
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
yet
it
was
in
egypt
that
it
was
framed
into
a
system
and
became
the
model
for
the
christian
world
it
took
its
rise
in
the
serious
and
gloomy
views
of
religion
which
always
formed
part
of
the
egyptian
polytheism
and
which
the
greeks
remarked
as
very
unlike
their
own
gay
and
tasteful
modes
of
worship
and
which
were
readily
engrafted
by
the
egyptian
converts
into
their
own
christian
belief
in
the
reigns
of
constantine
and
his
sons
hundreds
of
christians
both
men
and
women
quitting
the
pleasures
and
trials
of
the
busy
world
withdrew
one
by
one
into
the
egyptian
desert
where
the
sands
are
as
boundless
as
the
ocean
where
the
sunshine
is
less
cheerful
than
darkness
to
spend
their
lonely
days
and
watchful
nights
in
religious
meditation
and
in
prayer
they
were
led
by
a
gloomy
view
of
their
duty
towards
god
and
by
a
want
of
for
their
neighbour
and
they
seemed
to
think
that
pain
and
misery
in
this
world
would
save
them
from
punishment
hereafter
the
lives
of
many
of
these
fathers
of
the
desert
were
written
by
the
christians
who
lived
at
the
same
time
but
a
full
account
of
the
miracles
which
were
said
to
have
been
worked
in
their
favour
or
by
their
means
would
now
only
call
forth
a
smile
of
pity
or
perhaps
even
of
ridicule
and
peace
says
gibbon
the
distinction
of
the
vulgar
and
the
ascetic
christians
the
loose
and
imperfect
practice
of
religion
satisfied
the
conscience
of
the
multitude
the
prince
or
magistrate
soldier
or
merchant
reconciled
their
fervent
zeal
and
implicit
faith
with
the
exercise
of
their
profession
the
pursuit
of
their
interest
and
the
indulgence
of
their
passions
but
the
ascetics
who
obeyed
and
abused
the
rigid
precepts
of
the
gospel
were
inspired
by
the
severe
enthusiasm
which
represents
man
as
a
criminal
and
god
as
a
tyrant
they
seriously
renounced
the
business
and
the
pleasures
of
the
age
abjured
the
use
of
wine
of
flesh
and
of
marriage
chastised
their
body
mortified
their
affections
and
embraced
a
life
of
misery
as
the
price
of
eternal
happiness
the
ascetics
fled
from
a
profane
and
degenerate
world
to
perpetual
solitude
or
religious
society
like
the
first
christians
of
jerusalem
they
resigned
the
use
or
the
property
of
their
temporal
possessions
established
regular
communities
of
the
same
sex
and
a
similar
disposition
and
assumed
the
names
of
hermits
monks
or
anchorites
expressive
of
their
lonely
retreat
in
a
natural
or
artificial
desert
they
soon
acquired
the
respect
of
the
world
which
they
despised
and
the
loudest
applause
was
bestowed
on
this
divine
philosophy
which
surpassed
without
the
aid
of
science
or
reason
the
laborious
virtues
of
the
grecian
schools
the
monks
might
indeed
contend
with
the
stoics
in

churches
computed
ten
thousand

twenty
thousand

of

the
monks
borrowed
many
of
their
customs
from
the
old
egyptian
priests
such
as
shaving
the
head
and
athanasius
in
his
charge
to
them
orders
them
not
to
adopt
the
tonsure
on
the
head
nor
to
shave
the
beard
he
forbids
their
employing
magic
or
incantations
to
assist
their
prayers
he
endeavours
to
stop
their
emulation
in
fasting
and
orders
those
whose
strength
of
body
enabled
them
to
fast
longest
not
to
boast
of
it
but
he
orders
them
not
even
to
speak
to
a
woman
and
wishes
them
not
to
bathe
as
being
an
immodest
act
the
early
christians
as
being
a
sect
of
jews
had
followed
many
jewish
customs
such
as
observing
the
sabbath
as
well
as
the
day
but
latterly
the
line
between
the
two
religions
had
been
growing
wider
and
athanasius
orders
the
monks
not
to
keep
holy
the
jewish
sabbath
after
a
few
years
their
religious
duties
were
clearly
laid
down
for
them
in
several
codes
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
ascetics
was
amnion
who
on
the
morning
of
his
marriage
is
said
to
have
persuaded
his
young
wife
of
the
superior
holiness
of
a
single
life
and
to
have
agreed
with
her
that
they
should
devote
themselves
apart
to
the
honour
of
god
in
the
desert
but
in
thus
avoiding
the
pleasures
the
duties
and
the
temptations
of
the
world
amnion
lost
many
of
the
virtues
and
even
the
decencies
of
society
he
never
washed
himself
or
changed
his
garments
because
he
thought
it
wrong
for
a
religious
man
even
to
see
himself
undressed
and
when
he
had
occasion
to
cross
a
canal
his
biographer
tells
us
that
attendant
angels
carried
him
over
the
water
in
their
arms
lest
while
keeping
his
vows
he
should
be
troubled
by
wet
clothes
in
the
religious
controversies
whether
pagan
or
christian
rome
had
often
looked
to
egypt
for
its
opinions
constans
when
wanting
copies
of
the
greek
scriptures
for
rome
had
lately
sent
to
alexandria
and
had
received
the
approved
text
from
athanasius
the
two
countries
held
nearly
the
same
opinions
and
had
the
same
dislike
of
the
greeks
so
when
jerome
visited
egypt
he
found
the
church
holding
he
said
the
true
roman
faith
as
taught
by
the
apostles
under
didymus
who
was
then
the
head
of
the
catechetical
school
jerome
pursued
his
studies
having
the
same
religious
opinions
with
the
egyptian
and
the
same
dislike
to
arianism
but
no
dread
of
heresy
stopped
jerome
in
his
search
for
knowledge
and
for
books
he
obtained
copies
of
the
whole
of
works
and
read
them
with
the
greatest
admiration
it
is
true
that
he
finds
fault
with
many
of
his
opinions
but
no
admirer
of
origen
could
speak
in
higher
terms
of
praise
of
his
virtues
and
his
learning
of
the
qualities
of
his
head
and
of
his
heart
than
jerome
uses
while
he
timidly
pretends
to
think
that
he
has
done
wrong
in
reading
his
works
at
this
time
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
after
the
building
of
the
city
the
emperor
himself
did
not
refuse
to
mark
on
his
roman
coins
the
renewal
of
the
by
the
old
egyptian
astrological
fable
of
the
return
of
the
phoenix
from
the
treatise
of
julius
fermicus
against
the
pagan
superstitions
it
would
seem
that
the
sacred
animals
of
the
egyptians
were
no
longer
kept
in
the
several
cities
in
which
they
used
to
be
worshipped
and
that
many
of
the
old
gods
had
been
gradually
dropped
from
the
mythology
which
was
then
chiefly
confined
to
the
worship
of
isis
and
osiris
the
great
week
of
the
year
was
the
feast
of
isis
when
the
priests
joined
the
goddess
in
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
the
good
osiris
who
had
been
killed
through
jealousy
by
the
wicked
typhon
the
priests
shaved
their
heads
beat
their
breasts
tore
the
skin
off
their
arms
and
opened
up
the
old
wounds
of
former
years
in
grief
for
the
death
of
osiris
and
in
honour
of
the
widowed
isis
the
river
nile
was
also
still
worshipped
for
the
blessings
which
it
scatters
along
its
banks
but
we
hear
no
more
of
chem
horus
aroëris
and
the
other
gods
of
the
thebaid
whose
worship
ceased
with
the
fall
of
that
part
of
the
country
illustration
coin
of
constantius
but
great
changes
often
take
place
with
very
little
improvement
the
fall
of
idolatry
only
made
way
for
the
rise
of
magic
and
astrology
abydos
in
upper
egypt
had
latterly
gained
great
renown
for
the
temple
of
bîsû
whose
oracle
was
much
consulted
not
only
by
the
egyptians
but
by
greek
strangers
and
by
others
who
sent
their
questions
in
writing
some
of
these
letters
on
parchment
had
been
taken
from
the
temple
by
informers
and
carried
to
the
emperor
whose
ears
were
never
deaf
to
a
charge
against
the
pagans
on
this
accusation
numbers
of
all
ranks
were
dragged
out
of
egypt
to
be
tried
and
punished
in
syria
with
torture
and
forfeiture
of
goods
such
indeed
was
the
belief
in
these
oracles
and
prophecies
that
it
gave
to
the
priests
a
greater
power
than
it
was
safe
to
trust
them
with
by
prophesying
that
a
man
was
to
be
an
emperor
they
could
make
him
a
traitor
and
perhaps
raise
a
village
in
rebellion
as
the
devotedness
of
their
followers
made
it
dangerous
for
the
magistrates
to
punish
the
they
had
no
choice
but
to
punish
those
who
consulted
them
without
forbidding
the
divine
oracle
to
answer
they
forbade
anybody
to
question
it
parnasius
who
had
been
a
prefect
of
egypt
a
man
of
spotless
character
was
banished
for
thus
illegally
seeking
a
knowledge
of
the
future
and
demetrius
cythras
an
aged
philosopher
was
put
to
the
rack
on
a
charge
of
having
sacrificed
to
the
god
and
only
released
because
he
persisted
through
his
tortures
in
asserting
that
he
sacrificed
in
gratitude
and
not
from
a
wish
thus
to
learn
his
future
fate
in
the
falling
state
of
the
empire
the
towns
and
villages
of
egypt
found
their
rulers
too
weak
either
to
guard
them
or
to
tyrannise
over
them
and
they
sometimes
formed
themselves
into
small
societies
and
took
means
for
their
own
defence
the
law
had
so
far
allowed
this
as
in
some
cases
to
grant
a
corporate
constitution
to
a
city
but
in
other
cases
a
city
kept
in
its
pay
a
courtier
or
government
servant
powerful
enough
to
guard
it
against
the
extortions
of
the
provincial
or
would
put
itself
under
the
patronage
of
a
neighbour
rich
enough
and
strong
enough
to
guard
it
this
however
could
not
be
allowed
even
if
not
used
as
the
means
of
throwing
off
the
authority
of
the
provincial
government
and
accordingly
at
this
time
we
begin
to
find
laws
against
the
new
crime
of
these
associations
gave
a
place
of
refuge
to
criminals
they
stopped
the
worshipper
in
his
way
to
the
temple
and
the
in
collecting
the
tribute
but
new
laws
have
little
weight
when
there
is
no
power
to
enforce
them
and
the
orders
from
constantinople
were
little
heeded
in
upper
egypt
but
this
which
the
emperor
wished
to
put
down
was
weak
compared
to
that
of
the
bishops
and
clergy
which
the
law
allowed
and
even
upheld
and
which
was
the
great
check
to
the
tyranny
of
the
civil
governor
while
the
emperor
at
a
distance
gave
orders
through
his
prefect
the
people
looked
up
to
the
bishop
as
their
head
and
hence
the
power
of
each
was
checked
by
the
other
the
emperors
had
not
yet
made
the
terrors
of
religion
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
magistrate
nor
had
they
yet
learned
from
the
pontifex
and
augurs
of
pagan
rome
the
secret
that
civil
power
is
never
so
strong
as
when
based
on
that
of
the
church
on
the
death
of
constantius
in
julian
was
at
once
acknowledged
as
emperor
and
the
roman
world
was
again
but
for
the
last
time
governed
by
a
pagan
the
christians
had
been
in
power
for
years
under
constantine
and
his
sons
during
which
time
the
pagans
had
been
made
to
feel
that
their
enemies
had
got
the
upper
hand
of
them
but
on
the
accession
of
julian
their
places
were
again
changed
and
the
egyptians
among
others
crowded
to
constantinople
to
complain
of
injustice
done
by
the
christian
prefect
and
bishop
and
to
pray
for
a
redress
of
wrongs
they
were
however
sadly
disappointed
in
their
emperor
he
put
them
off
with
an
unfeeling
joke
he
ordered
them
to
meet
him
at
chalcedon
on
the
other
side
of
the
straits
of
constantinople
and
instead
of
following
them
according
to
his
promise
he
gave
orders
that
no
vessel
should
bring
an
egyptian
from
chalcedon
to
the
capital
and
the
egyptians
after
wasting
their
time
and
money
returned
home
in
despair
but
though
their
complaints
were
laughed
at
they
were
not
overlooked
and
the
author
of
their
grievances
was
punished
artemius
the
prefect
of
egypt
was
summoned
to
chalcedon
and
not
being
able
to
disprove
the
crimes
laid
to
his
charge
by
the
alexandrians
he
paid
his
life
as
the
forfeit
for
his
during
the
last
reign
while
artemius
was
on
his
trial
the
pagans
of
alexandria
remained
quiet
and
in
daily
fear
of
his
return
to
power
for
after
their
treatment
at
chalcedon
they
by
no
means
felt
sure
of
what
would
be
the
policy
in
matters
of
religion
but
they
no
sooner
heard
of
the
death
of
artemius
than
they
took
it
as
a
sign
that
they
had
full
leave
to
revenge
themselves
on
the
christians
the
mob
rose
first
against
the
bishop
george
who
had
lately
been
careless
or
wanton
enough
publicly
to
declare
his
regret
that
any
of
their
temples
should
be
allowed
to
stand
and
they
seized
him
in
the
streets
and
trampled
him
to
death
they
next
slew
dracontius
the
prefect
of
the
alexandrian
mint
whom
they
accused
of
overturning
a
pagan
altar
within
that
building
their
anger
was
then
turned
against
diodorus
who
was
employed
in
building
a
church
on
a
waste
spot
of
ground
that
had
once
been
sacred
to
the
worship
of
mithra
but
had
since
been
given
by
the
emperor
constantius
to
the
christians
in
clearing
the
ground
the
workmen
had
turned
up
a
number
of
human
bones
that
had
been
buried
there
in
former
ages
and
these
had
been
brought
forward
by
the
christians
in
reproach
against
the
pagans
as
so
many
proofs
of
human
sacrifices
in
his
christian
zeal
diodorus
also
had
wounded
at
the
same
time
their
pride
and
superstition
by
cutting
off
the
single
lock
from
the
heads
of
the
young
egyptians
this
lock
had
in
the
time
of
ramses
been
the
mark
of
youthful
royalty
under
the
ptolemies
the
mark
of
high
rank
but
was
now
common
to
all
diodorus
treated
it
as
an
offence
against
his
religion
for
this
he
was
attacked
and
killed
with
george
and
dracontius
the
mob
carried
the
bodies
of
the
three
murdered
men
upon
camels
to
the
side
of
the
lake
and
there
burned
them
and
threw
the
ashes
into
the
water
for
fear
as
they
said
that
a
church
should
be
built
over
their
remains
as
had
been
sometimes
done
even
at
that
early
date
over
the
bodies
of
martyrs
illustration
a
young
egyptian
wearing
the
royal
lock
when
the
news
of
this
outrage
against
the
laws
was
brought
to
the
philosophical
emperor
he
contented
himself
with
threatening
by
an
imperial
edict
that
if
the
offence
were
repeated
he
would
visit
it
with
severe
punishment
but
in
every
act
of
julian
we
trace
the
scholar
and
the
lover
of
learning
george
had
employed
his
wealth
in
getting
together
a
large
library
rich
in
historians
rhetoricians
and
philosophers
of
all
sects
and
on
the
murder
of
the
bishop
julian
wrote
letter
after
letter
to
alexandria
to
beg
the
prefect
and
his
friend
porphyrius
to
save
these
books
and
send
them
to
him
in
cappadocia
he
promised
freedom
to
the
librarian
if
he
gave
them
up
and
torture
if
he
hid
them
and
further
begged
that
no
books
in
favour
of
christianity
should
be
destroyed
lest
other
and
better
books
should
be
lost
with
them
there
is
too
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
friends
of
athanasius
were
not
displeased
at
the
murder
of
the
bishop
george
and
their
arian
at
any
rate
they
made
no
effort
to
save
them
and
the
same
mob
that
had
put
to
death
george
as
an
enemy
to
paganism
now
joined
his
rival
athanasius
in
a
triumphal
entry
into
the
city
when
with
the
other
egyptian
bishops
he
was
allowed
to
return
from
banishment
athanasius
could
brook
no
rival
to
his
power
the
civil
force
of
the
city
was
completely
overpowered
by
his
party
and
the
arian
clergy
were
forced
to
hide
themselves
as
the
only
means
of
saving
their
lives
but
while
thus
in
danger
from
their
enemies
the
arians
to
elect
a
successor
to
their
murdered
bishop
and
they
chose
lucius
to
that
post
of
honour
but
of
danger
athanasius
however
in
reality
and
openly
filled
the
office
of
bishop
and
he
summoned
a
synod
at
alexandria
at
which
he
into
the
church
lucifer
and
eusebius
two
bishops
who
had
been
banished
to
the
thebaid
and
he
again
decreed
that
the
three
persons
in
the
trinity
were
of
one
substance
though
the
emperor
julian
thought
that
george
the
late
bishop
had
deserved
all
that
he
suffered
as
having
been
zealous
in
favour
of
christianity
and
forward
in
putting
down
paganism
and
in
closing
the
temples
yet
he
was
still
more
opposed
to
athanasius
that
able
churchman
held
his
power
as
a
rebel
by
the
help
of
the
egyptian
mob
against
the
wishes
of
the
greeks
of
alexandria
and
against
the
orders
of
the
late
emperor
and
julian
made
an
edict
ordering
that
he
should
be
driven
out
of
the
city
within
hours
of
the
command
reaching
alexandria
the
prefect
of
egypt
was
at
first
unable
or
unwilling
to
enforce
these
orders
against
the
wish
of
the
inhabitants
and
athanasius
was
not
driven
into
banishment
till
julian
wrote
word
that
if
the
rebellious
bishop
were
to
be
found
in
any
part
of
egypt
after
a
day
then
named
he
would
fine
the
prefect
and
the
officers
under
him
one
hundred
pounds
weight
of
gold
thus
athanasius
was
for
the
fourth
time
banished
from
alexandria
though
the
christians
were
out
of
favour
with
the
emperor
and
never
were
employed
in
any
office
of
trust
yet
they
were
too
numerous
for
him
to
venture
on
a
persecution
but
julian
allowed
them
to
be
by
his
prefects
and
took
no
notice
of
their
complaints
he
made
a
law
forbidding
any
christians
being
educated
in
pagan
literature
believing
that
ignorance
would
stop
the
spread
of
their
religion
in
the
churches
of
greece
asia
minor
and
syria
this
was
felt
as
a
heavy
grievance
but
it
was
less
thought
of
in
egypt
science
and
learning
were
less
cultivated
by
the
christians
in
alexandria
since
the
overthrow
of
the
arian
party
and
a
little
later
to
charge
a
writer
with
grascizing
was
the
same
as
saying
that
he
wanted
orthodoxy
julian
was
a
warm
friend
to
learning
and
philosophy
among
the
pagans
he
recalled
to
alexandria
the
physician
zeno
who
in
the
last
reign
had
fled
from
the
georgian
faction
as
the
christians
were
then
called
he
founded
in
the
same
city
a
college
for
music
and
ordered
the
prefect
ecdicius
to
look
out
for
some
young
men
of
skill
in
that
science
particularly
from
among
the
pupils
of
dioscorus
and
he
allotted
them
a
maintenance
from
the
treasury
with
rewards
for
the
most
skilful
at
canopus
a
pagan
philosopher
antoninus
the
son
of
eustathius
taking
advantage
of
the
turn
in
public
opinion
and
copying
the
christian
monks
of
the
drew
round
him
a
crowd
of
followers
by
his
and
painful
torture
of
the
body
the
alexandrians
flocked
in
crowds
to
his
dwelling
and
such
was
his
character
for
holiness
that
his
death
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
theodosius
was
thought
by
the
egyptians
to
be
the
cause
of
the
overthrow
of
paganism
but
egyptian
paganism
which
had
slumbered
for
fifty
years
under
the
christian
emperors
was
not
again
to
be
awaked
to
its
former
life
though
the
wars
between
the
several
cities
for
the
honour
of
their
gods
the
bull
the
crocodile
or
the
fish
had
never
ceased
all
reverence
for
those
gods
was
dead
the
sacred
animals
in
particular
the
bulls
apis
and
mnevis
were
again
waited
upon
by
their
priests
as
of
old
but
it
was
a
vain
attempt
not
only
was
the
egyptian
religion
overthrown
but
the
thebaid
the
country
of
that
religion
was
fallen
too
low
to
be
raised
again
the
people
of
upper
egypt
had
lost
all
heart
not
more
from
the
tyranny
of
the
roman
government
in
the
north
than
from
the
attacks
and
settlement
of
the
arabs
in
the
south
all
changes
in
the
country
whether
for
the
better
or
the
worse
were
laid
to
the
charge
of
these
latter
unwelcome
neighbours
and
when
the
inquiring
traveller
asked
to
be
shown
the
crocodile
the
and
the
other
animals
for
which
egypt
had
once
been
noted
he
was
told
with
a
sigh
that
they
were
seldom
to
be
seen
in
the
delta
since
the
thebaid
had
been
peopled
with
the
blemmyes
falsehood
the
usual
vice
of
slaves
had
taken
a
deep
hold
on
the
egyptian
character
a
denial
of
their
wealth
was
the
means
by
which
they
usually
tried
to
save
it
from
the
roman
and
an
egyptian
was
ashamed
of
himself
as
a
coward
if
he
could
not
show
a
back
covered
with
stripes
gained
in
the
attempt
to
save
his
money
peculiarities
of
character
often
descend
unchanged
in
a
nation
for
many
centuries
and
after
fourteen
hundred
years
of
the
same
slavery
the
same
stripes
from
the
lash
of
the
still
used
to
be
the
boast
of
the
egyptian
peasant
cyrene
was
already
a
desert
the
only
cities
of
note
in
upper
egypt
were
koptos
hermopolis
and
antinoopolis
but
alexandria
was
still
the
queen
of
cities
though
the
large
quarter
called
the
bruchium
had
not
been
rebuilt
and
the
serapeum
with
its
library
of
seven
hundred
thousand
volumes
was
after
the
capitol
of
rome
the
chief
building
in
the
world
this
temple
of
serapis
was
situated
on
a
rising
ground
at
the
west
end
of
the
city
and
though
not
built
like
a
fortification
was
sometimes
called
the
citadel
of
alexandria
it
was
entered
by
two
roads
that
on
one
side
was
a
slope
for
carriages
and
on
the
other
a
grand
flight
of
a
hundred
steps
from
the
street
with
each
step
wider
than
that
below
it
at
the
top
of
this
flight
of
steps
was
a
portico
in
the
form
of
a
circular
roof
upheld
by
four
columns
illustration
an
egyptian
through
this
was
the
entrance
into
the
great
courtyard
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
the
roofless
hall
or
temple
surrounded
by
columns
and
porticoes
inside
and
out
in
some
of
the
inner
porticoes
were
the
bookcases
for
the
library
which
made
alexandria
the
very
temple
of
science
and
learning
while
other
porticoes
were
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
ancient
religion
the
roofs
were
ornamented
with
gilding
the
capitals
of
the
columns
were
of
copper
gilt
and
the
walls
were
covered
with
paintings
in
the
middle
of
the
inner
area
stood
one
lofty
column
which
could
be
seen
by
all
the
country
round
and
even
from
ships
some
distance
out
at
sea
the
great
statue
of
serapis
which
had
been
made
under
the
ptolemies
having
perhaps
marble
feet
but
for
the
rest
built
of
wood
clothed
with
drapery
and
glittering
with
gold
and
silver
stood
in
one
of
the
covered
chambers
which
had
a
small
window
so
contrived
as
to
let
the
rays
kiss
the
lips
of
the
statue
on
the
appointed
occasions
this
was
one
of
the
tricks
employed
in
the
sacred
mysteries
to
dazzle
the
worshipper
by
the
sudden
blaze
of
light
which
on
the
proper
occasions
was
let
into
the
dark
room
the
temple
itself
with
its
fountain
its
two
obelisks
and
its
gilt
ornaments
has
long
since
been
destroyed
and
the
column
in
the
centre
under
the
name
of
pillar
alone
remains
to
mark
the
spot
where
it
stood
and
is
one
of
the
few
works
of
greek
art
which
in
size
and
strength
vie
with
the
old
egyptian
monuments
the
reign
of
julian
instead
of
raising
paganism
to
its
former
strength
had
only
shown
that
its
life
was
spent
and
under
jovian
the
christians
were
again
brought
into
power
a
christian
emperor
however
would
have
been
but
little
welcome
to
the
egyptians
if
like
constantius
and
even
constantine
in
his
latter
years
he
had
leaned
to
the
arian
party
but
jovian
soon
showed
his
attachment
to
the
nicene
creed
and
he
athanasius
to
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
but
though
athanasius
regained
his
rank
yet
the
arian
bishop
lucius
was
not
deposed
each
party
in
alexandria
had
its
own
bishop
those
who
thought
that
the
son
was
of
the
same
substance
with
the
father
looked
up
to
athanasius
while
those
who
gave
to
jesus
the
lower
rank
of
being
of
a
similar
substance
to
the
creator
obeyed
lucius
this
curious
metaphysical
proposition
was
not
however
the
only
cause
of
the
quarrel
which
divided
egypt
into
such
angry
parties
the
creeds
were
made
use
of
as
the
watchwords
in
a
political
struggle
blood
language
and
geographical
boundaries
divided
the
parties
and
religious
opinions
seldom
cross
these
unchanging
and
inflexible
lines
every
egyptian
believed
in
the
nicene
creed
and
the
incorruptibility
of
the
body
of
jesus
and
hated
the
alexandrian
greeks
while
the
more
refined
greeks
were
as
united
in
explaining
away
the
nicene
creed
by
the
doctrine
of
the
two
natures
of
christ
and
in
despising
the
ignorant
egyptians
christianity
which
speaks
so
forcibly
to
the
poor
the
unlearned
and
the
slave
had
educated
the
egyptian
population
had
raised
them
in
their
own
eyes
and
as
the
popular
party
gained
strength
the
arians
lost
ground
in
alexandria
at
the
same
time
the
greeks
were
falling
off
in
learning
and
in
science
and
in
all
those
arts
of
civilisation
which
had
given
them
the
superiority
like
other
great
political
changes
this
may
not
have
been
understood
at
the
time
but
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
it
was
found
that
the
egyptians
were
no
longer
the
slaves
nor
the
greeks
the
masters
on
the
death
of
jovian
when
valentinian
divided
the
roman
empire
with
his
brother
he
took
italy
and
the
west
for
his
own
kingdom
and
gave
to
valens
egypt
and
the
eastern
provinces
in
which
greek
was
the
language
of
the
government
each
emperor
adopted
the
religion
of
his
capital
valentinian
held
the
nicene
faith
and
valens
the
arian
faith
and
unhappy
egypt
was
the
only
part
of
the
empire
whose
religion
differed
from
that
of
its
rulers
had
the
creeds
marked
the
limits
of
the
two
empires
egypt
would
have
belonged
to
rome
but
as
geographical
boundaries
and
language
form
yet
stronger
ties
egypt
was
given
to
constantinople
or
rather
to
antioch
the
nearer
of
the
two
eastern
capitals
by
valens
athanasius
was
forced
for
the
fifth
time
to
fly
from
alexandria
to
avoid
the
displeasure
which
his
disobedience
again
drew
down
upon
him
but
his
flock
again
rose
in
rebellion
in
favour
of
their
popular
bishop
and
the
emperor
was
either
persuaded
or
frightened
into
allowing
him
to
return
to
his
bishopric
where
he
spent
the
few
remaining
years
of
his
life
in
peace
athanasius
died
at
an
advanced
age
leaving
a
name
more
famous
than
that
of
any
one
of
the
emperors
under
whom
he
lived
he
taught
the
christian
world
that
there
was
a
power
greater
than
that
of
kings
namely
the
church
he
was
often
beaten
in
the
struggle
but
every
victory
over
him
was
followed
by
the
defeat
of
the
civil
power
he
was
five
times
banished
but
five
times
he
returned
in
triumph
the
temporal
power
of
the
church
was
in
its
infancy
it
only
rose
upon
the
conversion
of
constantine
and
it
was
weak
compared
to
what
it
became
in
after
ages
but
when
the
emperor
of
germany
did
penance
barefoot
before
pope
hildebrand
and
a
king
of
england
was
whipped
at
tomb
we
only
witness
the
strength
of
the
infant
power
that
was
being
reared
by
the
bishop
of
alexandria
his
writings
are
numerous
and
wholly
controversial
chiefly
against
the
arians
the
athanasian
creed
seems
to
have
been
so
named
only
because
it
was
thought
to
contain
his
opinions
as
it
is
known
to
be
by
a
later
author
on
the
death
of
athanasius
the
homoousian
party
chose
peter
as
his
successor
in
the
bishopric
overlooking
lucius
the
arian
bishop
whose
election
had
been
approved
by
the
emperors
julian
jovian
and
valens
but
as
the
egyptian
church
had
lost
its
great
champion
the
emperor
ventured
to
his
authority
he
sent
peter
to
prison
and
ordered
all
the
churches
to
be
given
up
to
the
arians
threatening
with
banishment
from
egypt
whoever
disobeyed
his
edict
the
persecution
which
the
homoousian
party
throughout
upper
egypt
then
suffered
from
the
arians
equalled
says
the
ecclesiastical
historian
anything
that
they
had
before
suffered
from
the
pagans
every
monastery
in
egypt
was
broken
open
by
lucius
at
the
head
of
an
armed
force
and
the
cruelty
of
the
bishop
surpassed
that
of
the
soldiers
the
breaking
open
of
the
monasteries
seems
to
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
inmates
bear
their
share
in
the
military
service
of
the
state
rather
than
for
any
religious
reasons
when
constantine
embraced
christianity
he
immediately
recognised
all
the
religious
scruples
of
its
professors
and
not
only
bishops
and
presbyters
but
all
laymen
who
had
entered
the
monastic
orders
were
freed
from
the
duty
of
serving
in
the
army
but
under
the
growing
dislike
of
military
service
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
soldiers
when
to
escape
from
the
army
many
called
themselves
christian
monks
this
excuse
could
no
longer
be
listened
to
and
valens
made
a
law
that
monastic
vows
should
not
save
a
man
from
enlistment
but
this
law
was
not
easily
carried
into
force
in
the
monasteries
on
the
borders
of
the
desert
which
were
often
and
fortresses
and
on
mount
nitria
in
particular
many
monks
lost
their
lives
in
their
resistance
to
the
troops
that
were
sent
to
fetch
recruits

were

by
the

to

it
was
now
teaching
the

the
worship
of

truest

pagans

were
now
no

able

they
chose
took
care
to
proclaim
their
opinions
indirectly
in
such
ways
as
the
law
could
not
reach
in
the
hippodrome
which
was
the
noisiest
of
the
places
where
the
people
met
in
public
they
made
a
profession
of
their
faith
by
the
choice
of
which
horses
they
bet
on
and
christians
and
pagans
alike
showed
their
zeal
for
religion
by
hooting
and
clapping
of
hands
prayers
and
superstitious
ceremonies
were
used
on
both
sides
to
add
to
the
speed

the
monk
hilarion
the
pupil
of
anthony
gained
no
little
credit
for
sprinkling
holy
water
on
the
horses
of
his
party
and
thus
enabling
christianity
to
outrun
paganism
in
the
hippodrome
at
gaza
during
these
reigns
of
weakness
and
misgovernment
it
was
no
doubt
a
cruel
policy
rather
than
humanity
that
led
the
to
collect
the
tribute
in
kind
more
could
be
squeezed
out
of
a
ruined
people
by
taking
what
they
had
to
give
than
by
requiring
it
to
be
paid
in
copper
coin
hence
valons
made
a
law
that
no
tribute
throughout
the
empire
should
be
taken
in
money

for
some
time
past
been
encroaching
on
the
eastern
frontiers
of
the
empire
and
had
only
been
kept
back
by
treaties
which
proved
the
weakness
of
the
romans
as
the
armies
of
constantinople
were
still
called
and
which
encouraged
the
barbarians
in
their
attacks
the

given
by
the
greeks
and
romans
to
the
nomadic
arabs
who
lived
on
the
borders
of
the
desert
during
the
middle
ages
the
muhammedans
coming
from
apparently
the
same
localities
were
also
called
saracens
on
the
death
of
their
king
the
command
over
the
saracens
fell
to
their
queen
masvia

broke

red
sea
on
this
valens
renewed
the
truce
but
on
terms
still
more
favourable
to
the
invaders
many
of
the
saracens
were
christians
and
by
an
article
of
the
treaty
they
were
to
have
a
bishop
granted
them
for
their
church
and
for
this
purpose
they
sent
moses
to
alexandria
to
be
ordained
but
the
saracens
sided
with
the
egyptians
in
religion
as
well
as
policy
against
the
arian
greeks
hence
moses
refused
to
be
ordained
by
lucius
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
and
chose
rather
to
receive
his
appointment
from

of
the
homoousian

the
reign

theodosius
which
extended

remarkable
for
the
blow
then
given
to
paganism
the
old
religion
had
been
sinking
even
before
christianity
had
become
the
religion
of
the
emperors
it
had
been
discouraged
by
constantine
who
had
closed
many
of
the
temples
but
theodosius
made
a
law
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
that
the
whole
of
the
empire
should
be
christian
and
should
receive
the
trinitarian
faith
he
soon
afterwards
ordered
that
sunday
should
be
kept
holy
and
forbade
all
work
and
on
that
day
and
he
sent
cynegius
the
prefect
of
the
palace
into
egypt
to
see
these
laws
carried
into
effect
in
that
province
the
wishes
of
the
emperor
were
ably
followed
up
by
theophilus
bishop
of
alexandria
he
cleansed
the
temple
of
mithra
and
overthrew
the
statues
in
the
celebrated
temple
of
serapis
which
seemed
the
very
citadel
of
paganism
he
also
exposed
to
public
ridicule
the
mystic
ornaments
and
statues
which
a
large
part
of
his
still
regarded
as
sacred
it
was
not
however
to
be
supposed
that
this
could
be
peaceably
borne
by
a
people
so
irritable
as
the
alexandrians
the
students
in
the
schools
of
philosophy
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
mob
to
stop
the
work
of
destruction
and
to
revenge
themselves
upon
their
assailants
and
several
battles
were
fought
in
the
streets
between
the
pagans
and
the
christians
in
which
both
parties
lost
many
lives
but
as
the
christians
were
supported
by
the
power
of
the
prefect
the
pagans
were
routed
and
many
whose
rank
would
have
made
them
objects
of
punishment
were
forced
to
fly
from
alexandria
no
sooner
had
the
troops
under
the
command
of
the
prefect
put
down
the
pagan
opposition
than
the
work
of
destruction
was
again
carried
forward
by
the
zeal
of
the
bishop
the
temples
were
broken
open
their
ornaments
destroyed
and
the
statues
of
the
gods
melted
for
the
use
of
the
alexandrian
church
one
statue
of
an
egyptian
god
was
alone
saved
from
the
wreck
and
was
set
up
in
mockery
of
those
who
had
worshipped
it
and
this
ridicule
of
their
religion
was
a
cause
of
greater
anger
to
the
pagans
than
even
the
destruction
of
the
other
statues
the
great
statue
of
serapis
which
was
made
of
wood
covered
with
plates
of
metal
was
knocked
to
pieces
by
the
axes
of
the
soldiers
the
head
and
limbs
were
broken
off
and
the
wooden
trunk
was
burnt
in
the
amphitheatre
amid
the
shouts
and
jeers
of
the
bystanders
a
conjectured
fragment
of
this
statue
is
now
in
the
british
museum

the
plunder
of
the
temple
of
serapis
the
great
library
of
more
than
seven
hundred
thousand
volumes

wholly
broken
up
and
scattered
orosius
the
spaniard
who
visited
alexandria
in
the
next
reign
may
be
trusted
when
he
says
that
he
saw
in
the
temple
the
empty
shelves
which
within
the
memory
of
men
then
living
had
been
plundered
of
the
books
that
had
formerly
been
got
together
after
the
library
of
the
bruchium
was
burnt
by
julius
cæsar
in
a
work
of
such
lawless
plunder
carried
on
by
ignorant
zealots
many
of
these
monuments
of
pagan
genius
and
learning
must
have
been
wilfully
or
accidentally
destroyed
though
the
larger
number
may
have
been
carried
off
by
the
christians
for
the
other
public
and
private
libraries
of
the
city
how
many
other
libraries
this
city
of
science
may
have
possessed
we
are
not
told
but
there
were
no
doubt
many
had
alexandria
during
the
next
two
centuries
given
birth
to
poets
and
orators
their
works
the
offspring
of
native
genius
might
perhaps
have
been
written
without
the
help
of
libraries
but
the
labours
of
the
mathematicians
and
grammarians
prove
that
the
city
was
still
well
furnished
with
books
beside
those
on
the
christian
controversies
when
the
christians
were
persecuted
by
the
pagans
none
but
men
of
unblemished
lives
and
unusual
strength
of
mind
stood
to
their
religion
in
the
day
of
trial
and
suffered
the
penalties
of
the
law
the
weak
the
ignorant
and
the
vicious
readily
joined
in
the
superstitions
required
of
them
and
embracing
the
religion
of
the
stronger
party
easily
escaped
punishment
so
it
was
when
the
pagans
of
alexandria
were
persecuted
by
theophilus
the
chief
sufferers
were
the
men
of
learning
in
whose
minds
paganism
was
a
pure
deism
and
who
saw
nothing
but
ignorance
and
superstition
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
who
thought
their
worship
of
the
trinity
only
a
new
form
of
polytheism
and
jokingly
declared
that
they
were
not
arithmeticians
enough
to
understand
it
olympius
who
was
the
priest
of
serapis
when
the
temple
was
sacked
and
as
such
the
head
of
the
pagans
of
alexandria
was
a
man
in
every
respect
the
opposite
of
the
bishop
theophilus
he
was
of
a
frank
open
countenance
and
agreeable
manners
and
though
his
age
might
have
allowed
him
to
speak
among
his
followers
in
the
tone
of
command
he
chose
rather
in
his
moral
lessons
to
use
the
mild
persuasion
of
an
equal
and
few
hearts
were
so
hardened
as
not
to
be
led
into
the
paths
of
duty
by
his
exhortations
whereas
the
furious
monks
says
the
indignant
pagan
were
men
only
in
form
but
swine
in
manners
whoever
put
on
a
black
coat
and
was
not
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
dirty
linen
gained
a
tyrannical
power
over
the
minds
of
the
mob
from
their
belief
in
his
holiness
and
these
men
attacked
the
temples
of
the
gods
as
a
propitiation
for
their
own
enormous
sins
thus
each
party
reproached
the
other
and
often
unjustly
among
other
religious
frauds
and
pretended
miracles
of
which
the
pagan
priests
were
accused
was
that
of
having
an
iron
statue
of
serapis
hanging
in
the
air
in
a
chamber
of
the
temple
by
means
of
a
loadstone
fixed
in
the
ceiling
the
natural
difficulties
shield
them
from
this
charge
but
other
accusations
are
not
so
easily
rebutted
after
this
attack
upon
the
pagans
their
religion
was
no
longer
openly
taught
in
alexandria
some
of
the
more
zealous
professors
withdrew
from
the
capital
to
canopus
about
ten
miles
distant
where
the
ancient
priestly
learning
was
still
taught
unpersecuted
because
unnoticed
and
there
under
the
pretence
of
studying
hieroglyphics
a
school
was
opened
for
teaching
magic
and
other
forbidden
rites
when
the
pagan
worship
ceased
throughout
egypt
the
temples
were
very
much
used
as
churches
and
in
some
cases
received
in
their
ample
courtyard
a
smaller
church
of
greek
architecture
as
in
that
of
medinet
abu
in
other
cases
christian
ornaments
were
added
to
the
old
walls

in
the
rock

of
kneph

to
abu
simbel

the
figure
of
the
saviour
with
a
glory
round
his
head

painted

remove
from

memorials
of
the
old
superstition

up

the
walls
with
mud
from
the

plaster

coating

now
take
away
at
a
time
when
the
idolatrous
figures
are
no
longer
dangerous
to
religion

we
find
the
sculpture
and
painting
fresh
as

would
be
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
the

upon
embracing
christianity
at

threw
off
all
of

pagan
rites
among
other
customs
that
they
still
clung
to

of

from
that
practice

because

were

with

inscriptions

he
boldly
asserted

disproved

summer
after
the
destruction
of
the
temples
the
waters
happened
to
rise
more
slowly
than
usual
and
the
egyptians
laid
the
blame
upon
the
christian
emperor
who
had
forbidden
their
sacrificing
the
usual
offerings
in
honour
of
the
illustration

showing
the
height
of
the
nile
in

the
alarm
for
the
loss
of
their
crops
carried
more
weight
in
the
religious
controversy
than
any
arguments
that
could
be
brought
against
pagan
sacrifices
and
the
anger
of
the
people
soon
threatened
a
serious
rebellion
evagrius
the
prefect
being
disturbed
for
the
peace
of
the
country
sent
to
constantinople
for
orders
but
the
emperor
remained
firm
he
would
make
no
change
in
the
law
against
paganism
and
the
fears
of
the
egyptians
and
alexandrians
were
soon
put
an
end
to
by
a
most
plenteous
overflow
since
the
time
of
athanasius
and
the
overthrow
of
the
arian
party

in

of

old

which
has
gained
a
notice
far
beyond
its
deserts
because
it
is
the
only
work
on
the
subject
that
has
come
down
to
us
the
only
christian
writings
of
this
time
that
we
know
of
are
the
paschal
letters
of
theophilus
bishop
of
alexandria
which
were
much
praised
by
jerome
and
by
him
translated
into
latin
they
are
full
of
bitter
reproaches
against
origen
and
his
writings
and
they
charge
him
with
having
treated
jesus
more
cruelly
than
pilate
or
the
jews
had
done
john
the
famous
monk
of
the
thebaid
was
no
writer
though
believed
to
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
he
was
said
to
have
foretold
the
victory
of
theodosius
over
the
rebel
maximus
and
when
the
emperor
had
got
together
his
troops
to
march
against
eugenius
another
rebel
who
had
seized
the
passes
of
the
julian
alps
he
sent
his
trusty
eunuch
eutropius
to
fetch
the
holy
egyptian
or
at
least
to
learn
from
him
what
would
be
the
event
of
the
war
john
refused
to
go
to
europe
but
he
told
the
messenger
that
theodosius
would
conquer
the
rebel
and
soon
afterwards
die
both

which
came
to
pass
as
might
easily
have
been
guessed
on
the
death
of
theodosius
in
the
roman
empire
was
again
divided
arcadius
his
elder
son
ruled
egypt
and
the
east
while
honorius
the
younger
held
the
west
and
the
reins
of
government
at
once
passed
from
the
ablest
to
the
weakest
hands
but
the
change
was
little
felt
in
egypt
which
continued
to
be
governed
by
the
patriarch
theophilus
without
the
name
but
with
very
nearly
the
power
of
a
prefect
he
was
a
bold
and
wicked
man
but
as
his
religious
opinions
were
for
the
homoousians
as
against
the
arians
and
his
political
feelings
were
for
the
egyptians
as
against
the
greeks
he
rallied
to
his
government
the
chief
strength
of
the
province
as
the
pagans
and
arians
of
alexandria
were
no
longer
worthy
of
his
enmity
he
fanned
into
a
flame
a
new
quarrel
which
was
then
breaking
out
in
the
egyptian
church
the
monks
of
upper
egypt
who
were
mostly
ignorant
and
unlettered
men
were
anthropomorphites
or
believers
that
god
was
in
outward
shape
like
a
man
they
quoted
from
the
jewish
scriptures
that
he
made
man
in
his
own
image
in
support
of
their
opinion
they
held
that
he
was
of
a
strictly
human
form
like
jesus
which
to
them
seemed
fully
asserted
in
the
nicene
creed
in
this
opinion
they
were
opposed
by
those
who
were
better
educated
and
it
suited
the
policy
of
theophilus
to
side
with
the
more
ignorant
and
larger
party
he
branded
with
the
name
of
origenists
those
who
argued
that
god
was
without
form
and
who
quoted
the
writings
of
origen
in
support
of
their
opinion
this
naturally
led
to
a
dispute
about
orthodoxy
and
that
admirable
writer
who
had
been
praised
by
all
parties
for
two
hundred
years
and
who
had
been
quoted
as
authority
as
much
by
athanasius
as
by
the
arians
was
declared
to
be
a
heretic
by
a
council
of
bishops
the
writings
of
origen
were
accordingly
forbidden
to
be
read
because
they
contradicted
the
anthropomorphite
opinions
the
quarrel
between
the
origenists
and
the
anthropomorphites
did
not
end
in
words
a
proposition
in
theology
or
a
doubt
in
metaphysics
was
no
better
cause
of
civil
war
than
the
old
quarrels
about
the
bull
apis
or
the
crocodile
but
a
change
of
religion
had
not
changed
the
national
character
the
patriarch
finding
his
party
the
stronger
attacked
the
enemy
in
their
own
monasteries
he
marched
to
mount
nitria
at
the
head
of
a
strong
body
of
soldiers
and
enrolling
under
his
banners
the
anthropomorphite
monks
attacked
dioscorus
and
the
origenists
set
fire
to
their
monasteries
and
laid
waste
the
place
theophilus
next
quarrelled
with
peter
the
chief
of
the
alexandrian
presbyters
whom
he
accused
of
admitting
to
the
sacraments
of
the
church
a
woman
who
had
not
renounced
the
manichean
heresy
and
he
then
quarrelled
with
isidorus
who
had
the
charge
of
the
poor
of
the
church
because
he
bore
witness
that
peter
had
the
orders
of
theophilus
himself
for
what
he
did
in
this
century
there
was
a
general
digging
up
of
the
bodies
of
the
most
celebrated
christians
of
former
ages
to
heal
the
diseases
and
strengthen
the
faith
of
the
living
and
constantinople
which
as
the
capital
of
the
empire
had
been
ornamented
by
the
spoils
of
its
subject
provinces
had
latterly
been
enriching
its
churches
with
the
remains
of
numerous
christian
saints
the
tombs
of
egypt
crowded
with
mummies
that
had
lain
there
for
centuries
could
of
course
furnish
relics
more
easily
than
most
countries
and
in
this
reign
constantinople
received
from
alexandria
a
quantity
of
bones
which
were
supposed
to
be
those
of
the
martyrs
slain
in
the
pagan
persecutions
the
archbishop
john
chrysostom
received
them
gratefully
and
though
himself
smarting
under
the
reproach
that
he
was
not
orthodox
enough
for
the
superstitious
egyptians
he
thanks
god
that
egypt
which
sent
forth
its
grain
to
feed
its
hungry
neighbours
could
also
send
the
bodies
of
so
many
martyrs
to
sanctify
their
churches
we
have
traced
the
fall
of
the
greek
party
in
alexandria
in
the
victories
over
the
arians
during
the
religious
quarrels
of
the
last
hundred
years
and
in
the
laws
we
now
read
the
loss
of
wealth
and
power
the
corporation
of
alexandria
was
no
longer
able
to
bear
the
expense
of
cleansing
the
river
and
keeping
open
the
canals
and
four
hundred
about
twelve
hundred
dollars
were
each
year
set
apart
from
the
duties
of
the
city
for
that
useful
work
the
arrival
of
new
settlers
in
alexandria
had
been
very
much
checked
by
the
less
prosperous
state
of
the
country
since
the
reign
of
diocletian
we
still
find
however
that
many
of
the
men
of
note
were
not
born

native
of

the
chief
man
of
learning
was
synesius
a
platonic
philosopher
whom
the
patriarch
theophilus
persuaded
to
join
the
christians
as
a
platonist
he
naturally
leaned
towards
many
of
the
doctrines
of
the
popular
religion
but
he
could
not
believe
in
a
resurrection
and
it
was
not
till
after
theophilus
had
ordained
him
bishop
of
ptolemais

cyrene
that
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
that
doctrine
nor
would
he
then
put
away
or
disown
his
wife

the
custom
of
the
church
required
indeed

accepted
the
bishopric
very
unwillingly
he
was
as
fond
of
playful
sport
as
he
was
of
books
and
very
much
disliked

has
left
a
volume

save

with

declared
him
to
be

gave
him

the

were
ashamed

taught

the
platonic
school
which
had
been
founded
by

and
which
boasted
of

as
its
pupil
she
was
as
modest
as
she
wras
graceful
eloquent
and
learned
and
though
being
a
pagan
she
belonged
to
neither
of
the
rival
christian
parties
yet
as
she
had
more
hearers
among
the
greek
friends
of
the
prefect
than
among
the
ignorant
followers
of
the
bishop
she
became
an
object
of
jealousy
with
the
homoousian
party
a
body
of
these
christians
says
the
orthodox
historian
attacked
this
admirable
woman
in
the
street
they
dragged
her
from

chariot

hurried
her
off
into

george
became
a
favourite
saint
with
the
greeks
in
egypt
and
in
those
spots
where
the
greek
soldiers
were
masters
of
the
churches
this
arian
and
unpopular
bishop
was
often
painted
on
the
walls
riding
triumphantly
on
horseback
and
slaying
the
dragon
of
athanasian
error
on
the
other
hand
in
alexandria
where
his
politics
and
opinions
held
the
upper
hand
the
monastery
of
athanasius
was
built
in
the
most
public
spot
in
the
city
probably
that
formerly
held
by
the
soma
or
royal
and
in
thebes
a
cathedral
church
was
dedicated
to
athanasius
within
the
great
courtyard
of
where
the
small
and
paltry
greek
columns
are
in
strange
contrast
to
the
grand
architecture
of
ramses
iii
which
surrounds
them
in
former
reigns
the
alexandrians
had
been
in
the
habit
of
sending
embassies
to
constantinople
to
complain
of
tyranny
or
misgovernment
and
to
beg
for
a
redress
of
grievances
when
they
thought
that
justice
could
be
there
obtained
when
it
was
refused
in
alexandria
but
this
practice
was
stopped
by
theodosius
who
made
a
law
that
the
alexandrians
should
never
send
an
embassy
to
constantinople
unless
it
were
agreed
to
by
a
decree
of
the
town
council
and
had
the
approbation
of
the
prefect
the
weak
and
idle
emperor
would
allow
no
appeal
from
the
tyranny
of
his
own
governor
we
may
pass
over
the
banishment
of
john
chrysostom
bishop
of
constantinople
as
having
less
to
do
with
the
history
of
egypt
though
as
in
the
cases
of
arius
and
nestorius
the
chief
mover
of
the
attack
upon
him
was
a
bishop
of
alexandria
who
accused
him
of
heresy
because
he
did
not
come
up
to
the
egyptian
standard
of
orthodoxy
but
among
the
bishops
who
were
deposed
with
chrysostom
was
palladius
of
galatia
who
was
sent
a
prisoner
to
syênê
as
soon
as
he
was
released
from
his
bonds
instead
of
being
cast
down
by
his
misfortunes
he
proposed
to
take
advantage
of
the
place
of
his
banishment
and
he
set
forward
on
his
travels
through
ethiopia
for
india
in
search
of
the
wisdom
of
the
brahmins
he
arrived
in
safety
at
adule
the
port
on
the
red
sea
in
latitude
now
known
as
zula
where
he
made
acquaintance
with
moses
the
bishop
of
that
city
and
persuaded
him
to
join
him
in
his
distant
and
difficult
voyage
from
adule
the
two
set
sail
in
one
of
the
vessels
employed
in
the
indian
trade
but
they
were
unable
to
accomplish
their
purpose
and
palladius
returned
to
egypt
worn
out
with
heat
and
fatigue
having
scarcely
touched
the
shores
of
india
on
his
return
through
thebes
he
met
with
a
traveller
who
had
lately
returned
from
the
same
journey
and
who
consoled
him
under
his
disappointment
by
recounting
his
own
failure
in
the
same
undertaking
his
new
friend
had
himself
been
a
merchant
in
the
indian
trade
but
had
given
up
business
because
he
was
not
successful
in
it
and
having
taken
a
priest
as
his
companion
had
set
out
on
the
same
voyage
in
search
of
eastern
wisdom
they
had
sailed
to
adule
on
the
abyssinian
shore
and
then
travelled
to
auxum
the
capital
of
that
country
from
that
coast
they
set
sail
for
the
indian
ocean
and
reached
a
coast
which
they
thought
was
taprobane
or
ceylon
but
there
they
were
taken
prisoners
and
after
spending
six
years
in
slavery
and
learning
but
little
of
the
philosophy
that
they
were
in
search
of
were
glad
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
escaping
and
returning
to
egypt
palladius
had
travelled
in
egypt
before
he
was
sent
there
into
banishment
and
he
had
spent
many
years
in
examining
the
monasteries
of
the
thebaid
and
their
rules
and
he
has
left
a
history
of
the
lives
of
many
of
those
holy
men
and
woman
addressed
to
his
friend
lausus
when
nestorius
was
deposed
from
the
bishopric
of
constantinople
for
refusing
to
use
the
words
of
as
the
title
of
mother
and
for
falling
short
in
other
points
of
what
was
then
thought
orthodoxy
he
was
banished
to
hibe
in
the
great
oasis
while
he
was
living
there
the
great
oasis
was
overrun
by
the
blemmyes
the
roman
garrison
was
defeated
and
those
that
resisted
were
put
to
the
sword
the
blemmyes
pillaged
the
place
and
then
withdrew
and
being
themselves
at
war
with
the
mazices
another
tribe
of
arabs
they
kindly
sent
their
prisoners
to
the
thebaid
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
latter
nestorius
then
went
to
panopolis
to
show
himself
to
the
governor
lest
he
should
be
accused
of
running
away
from
his
place
of
banishment
and
soon
afterwards
he
died
of
the
sufferings
brought
on
by
these
forced
and
painful
journeys
through
the
desert
about
the
same
time
egypt
was
visited
by
cassianus
a
monk
of
gaul
in
order
to
study
the
monastic
institutions
of
the
thebaid
in
his
work
on
that
subject
he
has
described
at
length
the
way
of
life
and
the
severe
rules
of
the
egyptian
monks
and
has
recommended
them
to
the
imitation
of
his
countrymen
but
the
natives
of
italy
and
the
west
do
not
seem
to
have
been
contented
with
copying
the
theban
monks
at
a
distance
such
was
the
fame
of
the
egyptian
monasteries
that
many
zealots
from
italy
flocked
there
to
place
themselves
under
the
severe
discipline
of
those
holy
men
as
these
latin
monks
did
not
understand
either
koptic
or
greek
they
found
some
difficulty
in
regulating
their
lives
with
the
exactness
and
the
rules
of
pachomius
of
theodorus
and
of
oresiesis
the
most
celebrated
of
the
founders
were
actually
sent
to
jerome
at
rome
to
be
by
him
translated
into
latin
for
the
use
of
these
settlers
in
the
thebaid
these
latin
monks
made
peter
a
popular
saint
in
some
parts
of
egypt
and
in
the
temple
of
asseboua
in
nubia
when
the
christians
plastered
over
the
figure
of
one
of
the
old
gods
they
painted
in
its
place
the
apostle
peter
holding
the
key
in
his
hand
illustration
ramses
ii
and
peter
they
did
not
alter
the
rest
of
the
sculpture
so
that
ramses
ii
is
there
now
seen
presenting
his
offering
to
the
christian
saint
the
mixed
group
gives
us
proof
of
the
decline
in
art
rather
than
of
its
improvement
in
religion
among
the
monks
of
egypt
there
were
also
some
men
of
learning
and
industry
who
in
their
cells
in
the
desert
had
made
at
least
three
translations
of
the
new
testament
into
the
three
dialects
of
the
koptic
language
namely
the
sahidic
of
upper
egypt
the
bashmuric
of
the
bashmour
province
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
delta
and
the
koptic
proper
of
memphis
and
the
western
half
of
the
delta
to
these
were
afterwards
added
the
acts
of
the
council
of
nicæa
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
martyrs
the
writings
of
many
of
the
christian
fathers
the
rituals
of
the
koptic
church
and
various
treatises
on
religion
other
monks
were
as
busy
in
making
copies
of
the
greek
manuscripts
of
the
old
and
new
testament
and
as
each
copy
must
have
needed
the
painful
labour
of
months
and
often
years
their
industry
and
zeal
must
have
been
great
most
of
these
manuscripts
were
on
papyrus
or
on
a
manufactured
papyrus
which
might
be
called
paper
and
have
long
since
been
lost
but
the
three
most
ancient
copies
on
parchment
which
are
the
pride
of
the
vatican
the
paris
library
and
the
british
museum
are
the
work
of
the
alexandrian
penmen
copies
of
the
bible
were
also
made
in
alexandria
for
sale
in
western
europe
and
all
our
oldest
manuscripts
show
their
origin
by
the
egyptian
form
of
spelling
in
some
of
the
words
the
beza
manuscript
at
cambridge
and
the
clermont
manuscript
at
paris
which
have
greek
on
one
side
of
the
page
and
latin
on
the
other
were
written
in
alexandria
the
latin
is
that
more
ancient
version
which
was
in
use
before
the
time
of
jerome
and
which
he
corrected
to
form
what
is
now
called
the
latin
vulgate
this
old
version
was
made
by
changing
each
greek
word
into
its
corresponding
latin
word
with
very
little
regard
to
the
different
characters
of
the
two
languages
it
was
no
doubt
made
by
an
alexandrian
greek
who
had
a
very
slight
knowledge
of
latin
already
the
papyrus
on
which
books
were
written
was
for
the
most
part
a
manufactured
article
and
might
claim
the
name
of
paper
in
the
time
of
pliny
in
the
first
century
the
sheets
had
been
made
in
the
old
way
the
slips
of
the
plant
laid
one
across
the
other
had
been
held
together
by
their
own
sticky
sap
without
the
help
of
glue
in
the
reign
of
aurelian
in
the
third
century
if
not
earlier
glue
had
been
largely
used
in
the
manufacture
and
it
is
probable
that
at
this
time
in
the
fifth
century
the
manufactured
article
almost
deserved
the
name
of
paper
but
this
manufactured
papyrus
was
much
weaker
and
less
lasting
than
that
made
after
the
old
and
more
simple
fashion
no
books
written
upon
it
remain
to
us
at
a
later
period
the
stronger
fibre
of
flax
was
used
in
the
manufacture
but
the
date
of
this
improvement
is
also
unknown
because
at
first
the
paper
so
made
like
that
made
from
the
papyrus
fibre
was
also
too
weak
to
last
it
was
doubtless
an
alexandrian
improvement
flax
was
an
egyptian
plant
was
an
egyptian
trade
and
theophilus
a
roman
writer
on
manufactures
when
speaking
of
paper
made
from
flax
clearly
points
to
its
alexandrian
origin
by
giving
it
the
name
of
greek
parchment
between
the
papyrus
of
the
third
century
and
the
strong
paper
of
the
eleventh
century
no
books
remain
to
us
but
those
written
on
parchment
the
monks
of
mount
sinai
suffered
much
during
these
reigns
of
weakness
from
the
marauding
attacks
of
the
arabs
these
men
had
no
strong
monastery
but
hundreds
of
them
lived
apart
in
single
cells
in
the
side
of
the
mountains
round
the
valley
of
feiran
at
the
foot
of
mount
serbal
and
they
had
nothing
to
protect
them
but
their
poverty
they
were
not
protected
by
egypt
and
they
made
treaties
with
the
neighbouring
arabs
like
an
independent
republic
of
which
the
town
of
feiran
was
the
capital
the
arabs
from
the
jordan
to
the
red
sea
made
robbery
the
employment
of
their
lives
and
they
added
much
to
the
voluntary
sufferings
of
the
monks
illustration
the
papyrus
plant
nilus
a
monk
who
had
left
his
family
in
egypt
to
spend
his
life
in
prayer
and
study
on
the
spot
where
moses
was
appointed
the
legislator
of
israel
describes
these
attacks
upon
his
brethren
and
he
boasts
over
the
israelites
that
notwithstanding
their
sufferings
the
monks
spent
their
whole
lives
cheerfully
in
those
very
deserts
which
chosen
people
could
not
even
pass
through
without
murmuring
nilus
has
left
some
letters
and
exhortations
it
was
then
probably
that
the
numerous
inscriptions
were
made
on
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
mount
serbal
and
on
the
path
towards
its
sacred
peak
which
have
given
to
one
spot
the
name
of
mokatteb
or
the
valley
of
writing
a
few
of
these
inscriptions
are
in
the
greek
language
the
egyptian
physicians
had
of
old
always
formed
a
part
of
the
priesthood
and
they
seem
to
have
done
much
the
same
after
the
spread
of
christianity
we
find
some
monks
named
who
owned
the
bishop
of
alexandria
as
their
head
and
who
united
the
offices
of
physician
and
nurse
in
waiting
on
the
sick
and
dying
as
they
professed
poverty
they
were
maintained
by
the
state
and
had
other
privileges
and
hence
it
was
a
place
much
sought
after
and
even
by
the
wealthy
but
to
lessen
this
abuse
it
was
ordered
by
an
imperial
rescript
that
none
but
poor
people
who
had
been
should
be
and
their
number
was
limited
first
to
five
hundred
but
afterwards
at
the
request
of
the
bishop
to
six
hundred
a
second
charitable
institution
in
alexandria
had
the
care
of
strangers
and
the
poor
and
was
also
managed
by
one
of
the
priests
alexandria
was
fast
sinking
in
wealth
and
population
and
several
new
laws
were
now
made
to
lessen
its
difficulties
one
was
to
add
a
hundred
and
ten
bushels
of
grain
to
the
daily
alimony
of
the
city
the
supply
on
which
the
riotous
citizens
were
fed
in
idleness
by
a
second
and
a
third
law
the
five
chief
men
in
the
corporation
and
every
man
that
had
filled
a
civic
office
for
thirty
years
were
freed
from
all
bodily
punishment
and
only
to
be
fined
when
convicted
of
a
crime
theodosius
built
a
large
church
in
alexandria
which
was
called
after
his
name
and
the
provincial
judges
were
told
in
a
letter
to
the
prefect
that
if
they
wished
to
earn
the
praise
they
must
not
only
restore
those
buildings
which
were
falling
through
age
and
neglect
but
must
also
build
new
ones
though
the
pagan
philosophy
had
been
much
discouraged
at
alexandria
by
the
destruction
of
the
temples
and
the
cessation
of
the
sacrifices
yet
the
philosophers
were
still
allowed
to
teach
in
the
schools
syrianus
was
at
the
head
of
the
platonists
and
he
wrote
largely
on
the
orphic
pythagorean
and
platonic
doctrines
in
his
commentary
on
metaphysics
he
aims
at
showing
how
a
pythagorean
or
a
platonist
would
successfully
answer
objections
he
seems
to
look
upon
the
writings
of
plotinus
porphyry
and
iamblichus
as
the
true
fountains
of
platonic
wisdom
quite
as
much
as
the
works
of
the
great
philosopher
who
gave
his
name
to
the
sect
syrianus
afterwards
removed
to
athens
to
take
charge
of
the
platonic
school
in
that
city
and
athens
became
the
chief
seat
of
alexandrian
platonism
olympiodorus
was
at
the
same
time
undertaking
the
task
of
forming
a
peripatetic
school
in
alexandria
in
opposition
to
the
new
platonism
and
he
has
left
some
of
the
fruits
of
his
labour
in
his
commentaries
on
aristotle
but
the
peripatetic
philosophy
was
no
longer
attractive
to
the
pagans
though
after
the
fall
of
the
catechetical
school
it
had
a
strong
following
of
christian
disciples
olympiodorus
also
wrote
a
history
but
it
has
long
since
been
lost
with
other
works
of
a
merit
he
was
a
native
of
the
thebaid
and
travelled
over
his
country
he
described
the
great
oasis
as
still
a
highly
cultivated
spot
where
the
husbandman
watered
his
fields
every
third
day
in
summer
and
every
fifth
day
in
winter
from
wells
of
two
and
three
hundred
feet
in
depth
and
thereby
raised
two
crops
of
barley
and
often
three
of
millet
in
a
year
olympiodorus
also
travelled
beyond
syênê
into
nubia
with
some
danger
from
the
blemmyes
but
he
was
not
able
to
see
the
emerald
mines
which
were
worked
on
mount
smaragdus
in
the
arabian
desert
between
koptos
and
berenice
and
which
seem
to
have
been
the
chief
object
of
his
journey
proclus
came
to
alexandria
about
the
end
of
this
reign
and
studied
many
years
under
olympiodorus
but
not
to
the
neglect
of
the
platonic
philosophy
of
which
he
afterwards
became
such
a
distinguished
ornament
and
support
the
other
alexandrians
under
whom
proclus
studied
were
hero
the
mathematician
a
devout
and
religious
pagan
leonas
the
rhetorician
who
introduced
him
to
all
the
chief
men
of
learning
and
orion
the
grammarian
who
boasted
of
his
descent
from
the
race
of
theban
priests
thus
the
pagans
still
held
up
their
heads
in
the
schools
nor
were
the
ceremonies
of
their
religion
though
unlawful
wholly
stopped
in
the
year
of
this
reign
when
the
people
were
assembled
in
a
theatre
at
alexandria
to
celebrate
the
midnight
festival
of
the
nile
a
sacrifice
which
had
been
forbidden
by
constantine
and
the
council
of
nicsea
the

upwards
of
five
hundred
persons
were
killed

resting
in
the

it
will
be
of
some
interest
to
review
here
the
machinery
of
officers
and
deputies
civil
as
well
as
military
by
which
egypt
was
governed
under
the
successors
of
constantine
the
whole
of
the
eastern
empire
was
placed
under
two
prefects
the
pretorian
prefect
of
the
east
and
the
pretorian
prefect
of
illyricum
who
living
at
constantinople
like
modern
secretaries
of
state
made
edicts
for
the
government
of
the
provinces
and
heard
the
appeals
under
the
prefect
of
the
east
were
fifteen
consular
provinces
together
with
egypt
which
was
not
any
longer
under
one
prefect
there
was
no
consular
governor
in
egypt
between
the
prefect
at
constantinople
and
the
six
prefects
of
the
smaller
provinces
these
provinces
were
upper
libya
or
cyrene
lower
libya
or
the
oasis
the
thebaid
ægyptiaca
or
the
western
part
of
the
delta
augustanica
or
the
eastern
part
of
the
delta
and
the
heptanomis
now
named
arcadia
after
the
late
emperor
each
of
these
was
under
an
augustal
prefect
attended
by
a
a
an
and
others
and
was
assisted
in
civil
matters
by
a
a
corresponding
secretary
a
secretary
with
a
crowd
of
or
clerks
the
military
government
was
under
a
count
with
two
dukes
with
a
number
of
legions
cohorts
troops
and
wedges
of
cavalry
stationed
in
about
fifty
cities
which
if
they
had
looked
as
well
in
the
field
as
they
do
upon
paper
would
have
made
theodosius
ii
as
powerful
as
augustus
but
the
number
of
greek
and
roman
troops
was
small
the
rest
were
barbarians
who
held
their
own
lives
at
small
price
and
the
lives
of
the
unhappy
egyptians
at
still
less
the
greeks
were
only
a
part
of
the
fifth
macedonian
legion
and
second
legion
which
were
stationed
at
memphis
at
parembole
and
at
apollinopolis
while
from
the
names
of
the
other
cohorts
we
learn
that
they
were
franks
portuguese
germans
quadri
spaniards
britons
moors
vandals
gauls
sarmati
assyrians
galatians
africans
and
others
of
less
known
and
more
remote
places
egypt
itself
furnished
the
egyptian
legion
part
of
which
was
in
mesopotamia
third
legion
of
thebans
the
first
maximinian
legion
of
thebans
which
was
stationed
in
thrace
second
flavian
legion
of
thebans
second
felix
legion
of
thebans
and
the
julian
alexandrian
legion
stationed
in
thrace
beside
these
there
were
several
bodies
of
native
militia
from
abydos
syênê
and
other
cities
which
were
not
formed
into
legions
the
egyptian
cavalry
were
a
first
and
second
egyptian
troop
several
bodies
of
native
archers
mounted
three
troops
on
dromedaries
and
a
body
of
third
legion
promoted
to
the
cavalry
these
egyptian
troops
were
chiefly
arab
settlers
in
the
thebaid
for
the
kopts
had
long
since
lost
the
use
of
arms
the
kopts
were
weak
enough
to
be
trampled
on
but
the
arabs
were
worth
bribing
by
admission
into
the
legions
the
taxes
of
the
province
were
collected
by
a
number
of
counts
of
the
sacred
largesses
who
wrere
under
the
orders
of
an
officer
of
the
same
title
at
constantinople
and
were
helped
by
a
body
of
counts
of
the
exports
and
imports
prefects
of
the
treasury
and
of
the
mints
with
an
army
of
clerks
of
all
titles
and
all
ranks
from
this
government
the
alexandrians
were
exempt
living
under
their
own
military
prefect
and
corporation
and
instead
of
paying
any
taxes
beyond
the
duties
at
the
port
they
received
a
bounty
in
grain
out
of
the
taxes
of
egypt
soon
after
this
we
find
the
political
division
of
egypt
slightly
altered
it
is
then
divided
into
eight
governments
the
upper
thebaid
with
eleven
cities
under
a
duke
the
lower
thebaid
with
ten
cities
including
the
great
oasis
and
part
of
the
heptanomis
under
a
general
upper
libya
or
cyrene
under
a
general
lower
libya
or
parastonium
under
a
general
arcadia
or
the
remainder
of
the
heptanomis
under
a
general
ægyptiaca
or
the
western
half
of
the
delta
under
an
augustalian
prefect
the
first
augustan
government
or
the
rest
of
the
delta
under
a
and
the
second
augustan
government
from
bubastis
to
the
red
sea
under
a
general
we
also
meet
with
several
military
stations
named
after
the
late
emperors
a
maximianopolis
and
a
dioclesianopolis
in
the
upper
thebaid
a
theodosianopolis
in
the
lower
thebaid
and
a
second
theodosianopolis
in
arcadia
but
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
what
villages
were
meant
by
these
names
which
were
perhaps
only
used
in
official
documents
the
empire
of
the
east
was
gradually
sinking
in
power
during
this
long
and
quiet
reign
of
theodosius
ii
but
the
empire
of
the
west
was
being
hurried
to
its
fall
by
the
revolt
of
the
barbarians
in
every
one
of
its
widespread
provinces
henceforth
in
the
weakness
of
the
two
countries
egypt
and
rome
are
wholly
separated
after
having
influenced
one
another
in
politics
in
literature
and
in
religion
for
seven
centuries
they
were
now
as
little
known
to
one
another
as
they
were
before
the
day
when
fabius
arrived
at
alexandria
on
an
embassy
from
the
senate
to
ptolemy
philadelphus
theological
and
political
quarrels
under
the
name
of
the
homoousian
and
arian
controversy
had
nearly
separated
egypt
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
during
the
reigns
of
constantius
and
valens
but
they
had
been
healed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
first
theodosius
who
governed
egypt
by
means
of
a
popular
bishop
and
the
policy
which
he
so
wisely
began
was
continued
by
his
successors
through
weakness
but
in
the
reign
of
marcian
the
old
quarrel
again
broke
out
and
though
it
was
under
a
new
name
it
again
took
the
form
of
a
religious
controversy
cyril
the
bishop
of
alexandria
died
in
the
last
reign
and
as
he
had
succeeded
his
uncle
so
on
his
death
the
bishopric
fell
to
dioscorus
a
relation
of
his
own
a
man
of
equal
religious
violence
and
of
less
learning
who
differed
from
him
only
in
the
points
of
doctrine
about
which
he
should
quarrel
with
his
about
the
same
time
eutyches
a
priest
of
constantinople
had
been
condemned
by
his
superiors
and
expelled
from
the
church
for
denying
the
two
natures
of
christ
and
for
maintaining
that
he
was
truly
god
and
in
no
respect
a
man
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
egyptian
church
and
therefore
dioscorus
the
bishop
of
alexandria
who
had
no
right
whatever
to
meddle
in
the
quarrels
at
constantinople
yet
acting
on
the
forgotten
rule
that
each
power
extended
over
all
christendom
undertook
of
his
own
authority
to
absolve
eutyches
from
his
excommunication
and
in
return
to
excommunicate
the
bishop
of
constantinople
who
had
condemned
him
to
settle
this
quarrel
a
general
council
was
summoned
at
chalcedon
and
there
six
hundred
and
bishops
met
and
condemned
the
faith
of
eutyches
and
further
explained
the
nicene
creed
to
which
eutyches
and
the
egyptians
always
appealed
they
excommunicated
eutyches
and
his
patron
dioscorus
who
were
banished
by
the
emperor
and
they
elected
proterius
to
the
then
vacant
bishopric
of
alexandria
in
thus
condemning
the
faith
of
eutyches
the
greeks
were
excommunicating
the
whole
of
egypt
the
egyptian
belief
in
the
one
nature
of
christ
which
soon
afterwards
took
the
name
of
the
jacobite
faith
from
one
of
its
popular
supporters
might
perhaps
be
distinguished
by
the
microscopic
eye
of
the
controversialist
from
the
faith
of
eutyches
but
they
equally
fell
under
the
condemnation
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
egypt
was
no
longer
divided
in
its
religious
opinions
there
had
been
a
party
who
though
egyptian
in
blood
held
the
arian
and
opinions
of
the
greeks
but
that
party
had
ceased
to
exist
their
religion
had
pulled
one
way
and
their
political
feelings
another
the
latter
were
found
the
stronger
as
being
more
closely
rooted
to
the
soil
and
their
religious
opinions
had
by
this
time
fitted
themselves
to
the
geographical
boundaries
of
the
country
hence
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
were
rejected
by
the
whole
of
egypt
and
the
quarrel
between
the
chalcedonian
and
jacobite
party
like
the
former
quarrel
between
the
athanasians
and
the
arians
was
little
more
than
another
name
for
the
unwillingness
of
the
egyptians
to
be
governed
by
constantinople
proterius
the
new
bishop
entered
alexandria
supported
by
the
prefect
floras
at
the
head
of
the
troops
but
this
was
the
signal
for
a
revolt
of
the
egyptians
who
overpowered
the
cohort
with
darts
and
stones
and
the
magistrates
were
driven
to
save
their
lives
in
the
celebrated
temple
of
serapis
but
they
found
no
safety
there
the
mob
surrounded
the
building
and
set
fire
to
it
and
burned
alive
the
greek
magistrates
and
friends
of
the
new
bishop
and
the
city
remained
in
the
power
of
the
rebellious
egyptians
when
the
news
of
this
rising
reached
constantinople
the
emperor
sent
to
egypt
a
further
force
of
two
thousand
men
who
stormed
alexandria
and
sacked
it
like
a
conquered
city
and
established
proterius
in
the
bishopric
as
a
punishment
upon
the
city
for
its
rebellion
the
prefect
stopped
for
some
time
the
public
games
and
the
allowance
of
grain
to
the
citizens
and
only
restored
them
after
the
return
to
peace
and
good
order
in
the
weak
state
of
the
empire
the
blemmyes
and
nubades
or
nobatæ
had
latterly
been
renewing
their
inroads
upon
upper
egypt
they
had
overpowered
the
romans
as
the
greek
and
barbarian
troops
of
constantinople
were
always
called
and
had
carried
off
a
large
booty
and
a
number
of
prisoners
maximinus
the
imperial
general
then
led
his
forces
against
them
he
defeated
them
and
made
them
beg
for
peace
the
barbarians
then
proposed
as
the
terms
of
their
surrender
never
to
enter
egypt
while
maximinus
commanded
the
troops
in
the
thebaid
but
the
conqueror
was
not
contented
with
such
an
unsatisfactory
submission
and
would
make
no
treaty
with
them
till
they
had
released
the
roman
prisoners
without
ransom
paid
for
the
booty
that
they
had
taken
and
given
a
number
of
the
nobles
as
hostages
on
this
maximums
agreed
to
a
truce
of
a
hundred
years
the
people
now
called
the
nubians
living
on
both
sides
of
the
cataract
of
syênê
declared
themselves
of
the
true
egyptian
race
by
their
religious
practices
they
had
an
old
custom
of
going
each
year
to
the
temple
of
isis
on
the
isle
of
elephantine
and
of
carrying
away
one
of
the
statues
with
them
and
returning
it
to
the
temple
when
they
had
consulted
it
but
as
they
were
now
being
driven
out
of
the
province
they
bargained
with
maximums
for
permission
to
visit
the
temple
each
year
without
hindrance
from
the
roman
guards
the
treaty
was
written
on
papyrus
and
nailed
up
in
this
temple
but
friendship
in
the
desert
says
the
proverb
is
as
weak
and
wavering
as
the
shade
of
the
acacia
tree
this
truce
was
no
sooner
agreed
upon
than
maximinus
fell
ill
and
died
and
the
nubades
at
once
broke
the
treaty
regained
by
force
their
hostages
who
had
not
yet
been
carried
out
of
the
thebaid
and
overran
the
province
as
they
had
done
before
their
defeat
illustration
isis
as
the
by
this
success
of
the
nubians
christianity
was
largely
driven
out
of
upper
egypt
and
about
seventy
years
after
the
law
of
thedosius
l
by
which
paganism
was
supposed
to
be
crushed
the
religion
of
isis
and
serapis
was
again
openly
professed
in
the
thebaid
where
it
had
perhaps
always
been
cultivated
in
secret
a
certain
master
of
the
robes
in
one
of
the
egyptian
temple
came
at
this
time
to
the
temple
of
isis
in
the
island
of
philæ
and
his
votive
inscription
there
declares
that
he
was
the
son
of
pachomius
a
prophet
and
successor
by
direct
descent
from
a
yet
more
famous
pachomius
a
prophet
who
we
may
easily
believe
was
the
christian
prophet
who
gathered
together
so
many
followers
in
the
island
of
tabenna
near
thebes
and
there
founded
an
order
of
christian
monks
these
christians
now
all
returned
to
their
paganism
nearly
all
the
remains
of
christian
architecture
which
we
meet
with
in
the
were
built
during
the
hundred
and
sixty
years
between
the
defeat
of
the
nubians
by
diocletian
and
their
victories
in
the
reign
of
marcian
the
nubians
were
far
more
civilised
than
their
neighbours
the
blemmyes
whom
they
were
usually
able
to
drive
back
into
their
native
deserts
we
find
an
inscription
in
bad
greek
in
the
great
temple
at
talmis
now
the
village
of
kalabshe
which
was
probably
written
about
this
time
a
conqueror
of
the
name
of
silco
there
declares
that
he
is
king
of
the
nubians
and
all
the
ethiopians
that
in
the
upper
part
of
his
kingdom
he
is
called
mars
and
in
the
lower
part
lion
that
he
is
as
great
as
any
king
of
his
day
that
he
has
defeated
the
blemmyes
in
battle
again
and
again
and
that
he
has
made
himself
master
of
the
country
between
talmis
and
primis
while
such
were
the
neighbours
and
inhabitants
of
the
thebaid
the
fields
were
only
and
the
desert
was
encroaching
on
the
paths
of
man
the
sand
was
filling
up
the
temples
covering
the
overthrown
statues
and
blocking
up
the
doors
to
the
tombs
but
it
was
at
the
same
time
saving
to
be
dug
out
in
after
ages
those
records
which
the
living
no
longer
valued
on
the
death
of
the
emperor
marcian
the
alexandrians
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
the
military
prefect
dionysius
who
was
then
fighting
against
the
nubades
in
upper
egypt
renewed
their
attack
upon
the
bishop
proterius
and
deposed
him
from
his
office
to
fill
his
place
they
made
choice
of
a
monk
named
timotheus
ælurus
who
held
the
jacobite
faith
and
having
among
them
two
deposed
bishops
they
got
them
to
ordain
him
bishop
of
alexandria
and
then
led
him
by
force
of
arms
into
the
great
church
which
had
formerly
been
called
temple
upon
hearing
of
the
rebellion
the
prefect
returned
in
haste
to
alexandria
but
his
approach
was
only
the
signal
for
greater
violence
and
the
enraged
people
murdered
proterius
in
the
baptistery
and
hung
up
his
body
at
the
tetrapylon
in
mockery
this
was
not
a
rebellion
of
the
mob
timotheus
was
supported
by
the
men
of
chief
rank
in
the
city
the
who
had
borne
state
offices
the
who
had
borne
civic
offices
and
the
or
contractors
for
the
freight
of
the
egyptian
tribute
were
all
opposed
to
the
claim
to
appoint
the
officer
whose
duties
were
much
more
those
of
prefect
of
the
city
than
patriarch
of
egypt
with
such
an
opposition
as
this
the
emperor
would
do
nothing
without
the
greatest
caution
for
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
egypt
altogether
but
so
much
were
the
minds
of
all
men
then
engrossed
in
ecclesiastical
matters
that
this
political
struggle
wholly
took
the
form
of
a
dispute
in
controversial
divinity
and
the
emperor
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chief
bishops
in
christendom
to
ask
their
advice
in
his
difficulty
these
theologians
were
too
busily
engaged
in
their
controversies
to
take
any
notice
of
the
danger
of
revolting
from
the
empire
and
joining
the
persians
so
they
strongly
advised
leo
not
to
depart
from
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
or
to
acknowledge
as
bishop
of
alexandria
a
man
who
denied
the
two
natures
of
christ
accordingly
the
emperor
again
risked
breaking
the
slender
ties
by
which
he
held
egypt
he
banished
the
popular
bishop
and
forced
the
alexandrians
to
receive
in
his
place
one
who
held
the
chalcedonian
faith
on
the
death
of
leo
he
was
succeeded
by
his
grandson
leo
the
younger
who
died
in
after
a
reign
of
one
year
and
was
succeeded
by
his
father
zeno
the
of
the
elder
leo
zeno
gave
himself
up
at
once
to
debauchery
and
vice
while
the
empire
was
harassed
on
all
sides
by
the
barbarians
and
the
provinces
were
roused
into
rebellion
by
the
cruelty
of
the
prefects
the
rebels
at
last
found
a
head
in
basilicus
the
of
leo
he
declared
himself
of
the
jacobite
faith
which
was
the
faith
of
the
barbarian
enemies
of
the
barbarian
troops
and
of
the
barbarian
allies
of
the
empire
and
proclaiming
himself
emperor
made
himself
master
of
constantinople
without
a
battle
and
drove
zeno
into
banishment
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
the
first
step
of
basilicus
was
to
recall
from
banishment
timotheus
ælurus
the
late
bishop
of
alexandria
and
to
restore
him
to
the
bishopric
he
then
addressed
to
him
and
the
other
recalled
bishops
a
circular
letter
in
which
he
repeals
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
the
nicene
creed
declaring
that
jesus
was
of
one
substance
with
the
father
and
that
mary
was
the
mother
of
god
the
march
of
timotheus
to
the
seat
of
his
own
government
from
constantinople
whither
he
had
been
summoned
was
more
like
that
of
a
conqueror
than
of
a
preacher
of
peace
he
deposed
some
bishops
and
restored
others
and
as
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
were
the
particular
objects
of
his
hatred
he
restored
to
the
city
of
ephesus
the
patriarchal
power
which
that
synod
had
taken
away
from
it
basilicus
reigned
for
about
two
years
when
he
was
defeated
and
put
to
death
by
zeno
who
regained
the
throne
as
soon
as
zeno
was
again
master
of
the
empire
he
the
creed
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
drove
away
the
jacobite
bishops
from
their
bishoprics
death
however
removed
timotheus
ælurus
before
the
orders
were
put
in
force
in
alexandria
and
the
egyptians
then
chose
peter
mongus
as
his
successor
in
direct
opposition
to
the
orders
from
constantinople
but
the
emperor
was
resolved
not
to
be
beaten
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
was
so
much
a
civil
office
that
to
have
given
up
the
appointment
to
the
egyptians
would
have
been
to
allow
the
people
to
govern
themselves
so
he
banished
peter
and
recalled
to
the
head
of
the
church
timotheus
salophaciolus
who
had
been
living
at
canopus
ever
since
his
loss
of
the
bishopric
but
as
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
enjoyed
the
ecclesiastical
revenues
and
was
still
in
appearance
a
teacher
of
religion
the
alexandrians
in
recollection
of
the
former
rights
of
the
church
still
claimed
the
appointment
they
sent
john
a
priest
of
their
own
faith
and
dean
of
the
church
of
john
the
baptist
as
their
ambassador
to
constantinople
not
to
remonstrate
against
the
late
acts
of
the
emperor
but
to
beg
that
on
future
occasions
the
alexandrians
might
be
allowed
the
old
privilege
of
choosing
their
own
bishop
the
emperor
zeno
seems
to
have
seen
through
the
earnestness
and
he
first
bound
him
by
an
oath
not
to
accept
the
bishopric
if
he
should
even
be
himself
chosen
to
it
and
he
then
sent
him
back
with
the
promise
that
the
alexandrians
should
be
allowed
to
choose
their
own
patriarch
on
the
next
vacancy
but
unfortunately
ambition
was
too
strong
for
his
oath
and
on
the
death
of
timotheus
which
happened
soon
afterwards
he
spent
a
large
sum
of
money
in
bribes
among
the
clergy
and
chief
men
of
the
city
and
thereby
got
himself
chosen
patriarch
on
this
the
emperor
seems
to
have
thought
only
of
punishing
john
and
he
at
once
gave
up
the
struggle
with
the
egyptians
believing
that
of
the
two
patriarchs
who
had
been
chosen
by
the
people
peter
mongus
who
was
living
in
banishment
would
be
found
more
dutiful
than
john
who
was
on
the
episcopal
throne
he
banished
john
and
recalled
peter
and
the
latter
agreed
to
the
terms
of
an
imperial
edict
which
zeno
then
put
forth
to
heal
the
disputes
in
the
egyptian
church
and
to
recall
the
province
to
obedience
this
celebrated
edict
usually
called
the
henoticon
is
addressed
to
the
clergy
and
laity
of
alexandria
egypt
libya
and
the
pentapolis
and
is
an
agreement
between
the
emperor
and
the
bishops
who
countersigned
it
that
neither
party
should
ever
mention
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
which
were
the
great
with
the
egyptians
illustration
street
sprinkler
at
alexandria
but
in
all
other
points
the
henoticon
is
little
short
of
a
surrender
to
the
people
of
the
right
to
choose
their
own
creed
it
styles
mary
the
mother
of
god
and
allows
that
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
nicæa
and
constantinople
contain
all
that
is
important
of
the
true
faith
john
when
banished
by
zeno
like
many
of
the
former
deposed
bishops
fled
to
rome
for
comfort
and
for
help
there
he
met
with
the
usual
support
and
felix
bishop
of
rome
wrote
to
constantinople
remonstrating
with
zeno
for
dismissing
the
patriarch
but
this
was
only
a
small
part
of
the
want
of
success
in
his
attempt
at
for
the
crafty
peter
who
had
gained
the
bishopric
by
subscribing
to
the
edict
was
no
sooner
safely
seated
on
his
episcopal
throne
than
he
denounced
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
its
decrees
as
heretical
and
drove
out
of
their
monasteries
all
those
who
still
adhered
to
that
faith
nephalius
one
of
these
monks
wrote
to
the
emperor
at
constantinople
in
complaint
and
zeno
sent
cosmas
to
the
bishop
to
threaten
him
with
his
imperial
displeasure
and
to
try
to
peace
in
the
church
but
the
arguments
of
cosmas
were
wholly
unsuccessful
and
zeno
then
sent
an
increase
of
force
to
arsenius
the
military
prefect
who
settled
the
quarrel
for
the
time
by
sending
back
the
most
rebellious
of
the
alexandrians
as
prisoners
to
constantinople
soon
after
this
dispute
peter
mongus
died
and
fortunately
he
was
succeeded
in
the
bishopric
by
a
peacemaker
athanasius
the
new
bishop
very
unlike
his
great
predecessor
of
the
same
name
did
his
best
to
heal
the
angry
disputes
in
the
church
and
to
reconcile
the
egyptians
to
the
imperial
government
hierocles
the
alexandrian
was
at
this
time
teaching
philosophy
in
his
native
city
where
his
zeal
and
eloquence
in
favour
of
platonism
drew
upon
him
the
anger
of
the
christians
and
the
notice
of
the
government
he
was
sent
to
constantinople
to
be
punished
for
not
believing
in
christianity
for
it
does
not
appear
that
like
the
former
hierocles
he
ever
wrote
against
it
there
he
bore
a
public
scourging
from
his
christian
torturers
with
a
courage
equal
to
that
formerly
shown
by
their
forefathers
when
tortured
by
his
when
some
of
the
blood
from
his
shoulders
flew
into
his
hand
he
held
it
out
in
scorn
to
the
judge
saying
with
ulysses
since
human
flesh
has
been
thy
food
now
taste
this
after
his
punishment
he
was
banished
but
was
soon
allowed
to
return
to
alexandria
and
there
he
again
taught
openly
as
before
paganism
never
wears
so
fair
a
dress
as
in
the
writings
of
hierocles
his
commentary
on
the
golden
verses
of
the
pythagoreans
is
full
of
the
loftiest
and
purest
morality
and
not
less
agreeable
are
the
fragments
that
remain
of
his
writings
on
our
duties
and
his
beautiful
chapter
on
the
pleasures
of
a
married
life
in
the
facetiæ
of
hierocles
we
have
one
of
the
earliest
that
has
been
saved
from
the
wreck
of
time
it
is
a
curious
proof
of
the
fallen
state
of
learning
the
sophists
had
long
since
made
themselves
ridiculous
books
alone
will
not
make
a
man
of
sense
and
in
the
jokes
of
hierocles
the
blunderer
is
always
called
a
man
of
learning
ætius
the
alexandrian
physician
has
left
a
large
work
containing
a
full
account
of
the
state
of
egyptian
medicine
at
this
time
he
describes
the
diseases
and
their
remedies
quoting
the
recipes
of
numerous
authors
from
the
king
nechepsus
galen
hippocrates
and
hioscorides
down
to
archbishop
cyril
he
is
not
wholly
free
from
superstition
as
when
making
use
of
a
green
jasper
set
in
a
ring
but
he
observes
that
the
patients
recovered
as
soon
when
the
stone
was
plain
as
when
a
dragon
was
engraved
upon
it
according
to
the
recommendation
of
nechepsus
in
nile
water
he
finds
every
virtue
and
does
not
forget
dark
paint
for
the
eyebrows
and
for
the
face
anastasius
the
next
emperor
succeeding
in
followed
the
wise
policy
which
zeno
had
entered
upon
in
the
latter
years
of
his
reign
and
he
strictly
adhered
to
the
terms
of
the
edict
the
four
patriarchs
of
alexandria
who
were
chosen
during
this
reign
john
a
second
john
dioscorus
and
timotheus
were
all
of
the
jacobite
faith
and
the
egyptians
readily
believed
that
the
emperor
was
of
the
same
opinion
when
called
upon
by
the
quarrelling
theologians
he
would
neither
reject
nor
receive
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
by
this
wise
conduct
he
governed
egypt
without
any
religious
rebellion
during
a
long
reign
the
election
of
dioscorus
however
the
third
patriarch
of
this
reign
was
not
brought
about
peaceably
he
was
the
cousin
of
a
former
patriarch
timotheus
ælurus
which
if
we
view
the
bishopric
as
a
civil
office
might
be
a
reason
for
the
wishing
him
to
have
the
appointment
but
it
was
no
good
reason
with
the
alexandrians
who
declared
that
he
had
not
been
chosen
according
to
the
canons
of
the
apostles
and
the
magistrates
of
the
city
were
forced
to
employ
the
troops
to
lead
him
in
safety
to
his
throne
after
the
first
ceremony
he
went
as
was
usual
at
an
installation
to
church
and
there
the
clergy
robed
him
in
the
patriarchal
state
robes
the
grand
procession
then
moved
through
the
streets
to
the
church
of
john
where
the
new
bishop
went
through
the
communion
service
but
the
city
was
much
disturbed
during
the
whole
day
and
in
the
riot
theodosius
the
son
of
calliopus
a
man
of
augustalian
rank
was
killed
by
the
mob
the
alexandrians
treated
the
affair
as
murder
and
punished
with
death
those
who
were
thought
guilty
but
the
emperor
looked
upon
it
as
a
rebellion
of
the
citizens
and
the
bishop
was
obliged
to
go
on
an
embassy
to
constantinople
to
appease
his
just
anger
anastasius
who
had
deserved
the
obedience
of
the
egyptians
by
his
moderation
pardoned
their
ingratitude
when
they
offended
but
he
was
the
last
byzantine
emperor
who
governed
egypt
with
wisdom
and
the
last
who
failed
to
enforce
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
any
wise
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
rulers
could
have
healed
the
quarrel
between
the
two
countries
and
made
the
egyptians
forget
the
wrongs
that
they
had
suffered
from
the
greeks
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
anastasius
the
persians
after
overrunning
a
large
part
of
syria
and
defeating
the
roman
generals
passed
pelusium
and
entered
egypt
the
army
of
kobades
laid
waste
the
whole
of
the
delta
up
to
the
very
walls
of
alexandria
eustatius
the
military
prefect
led
out
his
forces
against
the
invaders
and
fought
many
battles
with
doubtful
success
but
as
the
capital
was
safe
the
persians
were
at
last
obliged
to
retire
leaving
the
people
ruined
as
much
by
the
loss
of
a
harvest
as
by
the
sword
alexandria
suffered
severely
from
famine
and
the
diseases
which
followed
in
its
train
and
history
has
gratefully
recorded
the
name
of
urbib
a
christian
jew
of
great
wealth
who
relieved
the
starving
poor
of
that
city
with
his
bounty
three
hundred
persons
were
crushed
to
death
in
the
church
of
arcadius
on
easter
sunday
in
the
press
of
the
crowd
to
receive
his
alms
as
war
brought
on
disease
and
famine
they
also
brought
on
rebellion
the
people
of
alexandria
in
want
of
grain
and
oil
rose
against
the
magistrates
and
many
lives
were
lost
in
the
attempt
to
quell
the
riots
in
the
early
part
of
this
history
we
have
seen
ambitious
bishops
quickly
disposed
of
by
banishment
to
the
great
oasis
and
again
as
the
country
became
more
desolate
criminals
were
sufficiently
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
by
being
sent
to
thebes
alexandria
was
then
the
last
place
in
the
world
in
which
a
pretender
to
the
throne
would
be
allowed
to
live
but
egypt
was
now
ruined
and
anastasius
began
his
reign
by
banishing
to
the
fallen
alexandria
longinus
the
brother
of
the
late
king
and
he
had
him
ordained
a
presbyter
to
mark
him
as
unfit
for
the
throne
julianus
who
was
during
a
part
of
this
reign
the
prefect
of
egypt
was
also
a
poet
and
he
has
left
us
a
number
of
short
epigrams
that
form
part
of
the
volume
of
greek
anthology
which
was
published
at
constantinople
soon
after
this
time
christodorus
of
thebes
was
another
poet
who
joined
with
julianus
in
praising
the
emperor
anastasius
he
also
removed
to
constantinople
the
seat
of
patronage
and
the
fifth
book
of
the
greek
anthology
contains
his
epigrams
on
the
winners
in
the
in
that
city
and
on
the
statues
which
stood
around
the
public
gymnasium
illustration
illustrations
from
copy
of
dioscoride
the
song
like
the
tale
often
related
the
wonders
of
the
river
nile
the
overflowing
waters
first
manured
the
fields
and
then
watered
the
crops
and
lastly
carried
the
grain
to
market
and
one
writer
in
the
anthology
to
describe
the
country
life
in
egypt
tells
the
story
of
a
sailor
who
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
the
ocean
turned
husbandman
and
was
then
shipwrecked
in
his
own
meadows
the
at
this
time
sometimes
illuminated
their
more
valuable
parchments
with
gold
and
silver
letters
and
sometimes
employed
painters
to
ornament
them
with
small
paintings
the
beautiful
copy
of
the
work
of
dioscorides
on
plants
in
the
library
at
vienna
was
made
in
this
reign
for
the
princess
juliana
of
constantinople
in
one
painting
the
figure
of
science
or
invention
is
holding
up
a
plant
while
on
one
side
of
her
is
the
painter
drawing
it
on
his
canvas
and
on
the
other
side
is
the
author
describing
it
in
his
book
other
paintings
are
of
the
plants
and
animals
mentioned
in
the
book
a
copy
of
the
book
of
genesis
also
in
the
library
at
vienna
is
of
the
same
class
and
date
a
large
part
of
it
is
written
in
gold
and
silver
and
it
has
small
paintings
of
various
historical
subjects
in
these
the
story
is
well
told
though
the
drawing
and
perspective
are
bad
and
the
figures
crowded
but
these
alexandrian
paintings
are
better
than
those
made
in
rome
or
constantinople
at
this
time
with
the
spread
of
christianity
theatrical
representations
had
been
gradually
going
out
of
use
the
greek
tragedies
as
we
see
in
the
works
of
æschylus
sophocles
and
euripides
those
models
of
pure
taste
in
poetry
are
founded
on
the
pagan
mythology
and
in
many
of
them
the
gods
are
made
to
walk
and
talk
upon
the
stage
hence
they
of
necessity
fell
under
the
ban
of
the
clergy
as
the
christians
became
more
powerful
the
several
cities
of
the
empire
had
one
by
one
discontinued
these
popular
spectacles
and
usually
took
their
place
but
the
alexandrians
were
the
last
people
to
give
up
a
favourite
amusement
and
by
the
end
of
this
reign
alexandria
was
the
only
city
in
the
empire
where
tragic
and
comic
actors
and
eastern
dancers
were
to
be
seen
in
the
theatre
the
tower
or
lighthouse
on
the
island
of
pharos
the
work
of
days
more
prosperous
than
these
had
latterly
been
sadly
neglected
with
the
other
buildings
of
the
country
for
more
than
seven
hundred
years
the
pilot
on
approaching
this
flat
shore
after
dark
had
pointed
out
to
his
shipmate
what
seemed
a
star
on
the
horizon
and
comforted
him
with
the
promise
of
a
safe
entrance
into
the
haven
and
told
him
of
tower
but
the
waves
breaking
against
its
foot
had
long
since
carried
away
the
outworks
and
laid
bare
the
foundations
the
wall
was
undermined
and
its
fall
seemed
close
at
hand
the
care
of
anastasius
however
surrounded
it
again
with
piles
and
buttresses
and
this
monument
of
wisdom
and
science
which
deserved
to
last
for
ever
was
for
a
little
while
longer
saved
from
ruin
an
epigram
in
the
anthology
informs
us
that
ammonius
was
the
name
of
the
builder
who
performed
this
good
work
and
to
him
and
to
neptune
the
grateful
sailors
then
raised
their
hands
in
prayer
and
praise
in
justin
succeeded
anastasius
on
the
throne
of
constantinople
and
in
the
task
of
defending
the
empire
against
the
persians
and
this
task
became
every
year
more
difficult
as
the
greek
population
of
his
egyptian
and
asiatic
provinces
fell
off
in
numbers
for
some
years
after
the
division
of
the
empire
under
the
sons
of
constantine
antioch
in
syria
had
been
the
capital
from
which
alexandria
received
the
commands
the
two
cities
became
very
closely
united
and
now
that
the
greeks
were
deserting
antioch
a
part
of
the
syrian
church
began
to
adopt
the
more
superstitious
creed
of
egypt
severus
bishop
of
antioch
was
successful
in
persuading
a
large
party
in
the
syrian
church
to
deny
the
humanity
of
christ
and
to
style
mary
the
mother
of
god
but
the
chief
power
in
antioch
rested
with
the
opposite
party
they
answered
his
arguments
by
threats
of
violence
and
he
had
to
leave
the
city
for
safety
he
fled
to
alexandria
and
with
him
began
the
friendship
between
the
two
churches
which
lasted
for
several
centuries
in
alexandria
he
was
received
with
the
honour
due
to
his
religious
zeal
but
though
in
antioch
his
opinions
had
been
too
egyptian
for
the
syrians
in
alexandria
they
were
too
syrian
for
the
egyptians
the
egyptians
who
said
that
jesus
had
been
crucified
and
died
only
in
appearance
always
denied
that
his
body
was
liable
to
corruption
severus
however
argued
that
it
was
liable
to
corruption
before
the
resurrection
and
this
led
him
into
a
new
controversy
in
which
timotheus
the
alexandrian
bishop
took
part
against
his
own
more
superstitious
flock
and
sided
with
his
friend
the
bishop
of
antioch
severus
has
left
us
in
the
syriac
language
the
baptismal
service
as
performed
in
egypt
the
priest
breathes
three
times
into
the
basin
to
make
the
water
holy
he
makes
three
crosses
on
the
forehead
he
adjures
the
demons
of
wickedness
to
quit
him
he
again
makes
three
crosses
on
his
forehead
with
oil
he
again
blows
three
times
into
the
water
in
the
form
of
a
cross
he
anoints
his
whole
body
with
oil
and
then
plunges
him
in
the
water
many
other
natives
of
syria
soon
followed
severus
to
alexandria
so
many
indeed
that
as
greek
literature
decayed
in
that
city
syriac
literature
rose
many
syrians
also
came
to
study
the
religious
life
in
the
monasteries
of
egypt
and
after
some
time
the
books
in
the
library
of
the
monastery
at
mount
were
found
to
be
half
arabic
and
half
syriac
justin
the
new
emperor
again
lighted
up
in
alexandria
the
flames
of
discord
which
had
been
allowed
to
slumber
since
the
publication
of
edict
but
in
the
choice
of
the
bishop
he
was
not
able
to
command
without
a
struggle
in
the
second
year
of
his
reign
on
the
death
of
timotheus
the
two
parties
again
found
themselves
nearly
equal
in
strength
and
alexandria
was
for
several
years
kept
almost
in
a
state
of
civil
war
between
those
who
thought
that
the
body
of
jesus
had
been
liable
to
corruption
and
those
who
thought
it
incorruptible
the
former
chose
gaianas
whom
his
adversaries
called
a
manichean
and
the
latter
theodosius
a
jacobite
who
had
the
support
of
the
prefect
and
each
of
these
in
his
turn
was
able
to
drive
his
rival
out
of
alexandria
those
persian
forces
which
in
the
last
reign
overran
the
delta
were
chiefly
arabs
from
the
opposite
coast
of
the
red
sea
to
make
an
end
of
these
attacks
and
to
engage
their
attention
in
another
quarter
was
the
natural
wish
of
the
statesmen
of
constantinople
and
for
this
purpose
anastasius
had
sent
an
embassy
to
the
homeritæ
on
the
southern
coast
of
arabia
to
persuade
them
to
attack
their
northern
neighbours
the
homeritæ
held
the
strip
of
coast
now
called
hadramout
they
were
enriched
though
hardly
civilised
by
being
the
channel
along
which
much
of
the
eastern
trade
passed
from
india
to
the
nile
to
avoid
the
difficult
navigation
of
the
ocean
they
were
jewish
arabs
who
had
little
in
common
with
the
arabs
of
yemen
but
had
frequent
intercourse
with
abyssinia
and
the
merchants
of
the
red
sea
part
of
the
trade
of
solomon
and
the
tyrians
was
probably
to
their
coast
to
this
distant
and
little
tribe
the
emperor
of
constantinople
now
sent
a
second
pressing
embassy
julianus
the
ambassador
went
up
the
nile
from
alexandria
and
then
crossed
the
red
sea
or
indian
sea
as
it
was
also
called
to
arabia
he
was
favourably
received
by
the
homeritæ
arethas
the
king
gave
him
an
audience
in
grand
barbaric
state
he
was
standing
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
four
elephants
he
wore
no
clothing
but
a
cloth
of
gold
around
his
loins
his
arms
were
laden
with
costly
armlets
and
bracelets
he
held
a
shield
and
two
spears
in
his
hands
and
his
nobles
stood
around
him
armed
and
singing
to
his
honour
when
the
ambassador
delivered
the
letter
arethas
kissed
the
seal
and
then
kissed
julianus
himself
he
accepted
the
gifts
which
justin
had
sent
and
promised
to
move
his
forces
northward
against
the
persians
as
requested
and
also
to
keep
the
route
open
for
the
trade
to
alexandria
justinian
the
successor
of
justin
in
settled
the
quarrel
between
the
two
alexandrian
bishops
by
summoning
them
both
to
constantinople
and
then
sending
them
into
banishment
but
this
had
no
effect
in
healing
the
divisions
in
the
egyptian
church
and
for
the
next
the
two
parties
ranged
themselves
in
their
theological
or
rather
political
quarrel
under
the
names
of
their
former
bishops
and
called
themselves
gaianites
and
theodosians
nor
did
the
measures
of
justinian
tend
to
lessen
the
breach
between
egypt
and
constantinople
he
appointed
paul
to
the
bishopric
and
required
the
egyptians
to
receive
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
after
two
years
paul
was
displaced
either
by
the
emperor
or
by
his
flock
and
zoilus
was
then
seated
on
the
episcopal
throne
by
the
help
of
the
imperial
forces
he
maintained
his
dangerous
post
for
about
six
years
when
the
alexandrians
rose
in
open
rebellion
overpowered
the
troops
and
forced
him
to
seek
safety
in
flight
and
the
jacobite
party
then
turned
out
all
the
bishops
who
held
the
greek
faith
when
justinian
heard
that
the
jacobites
were
masters
of
egypt
he
appointed
apollinarius
to
the
joint
office
of
prefect
and
patriarch
of
alexandria
and
sent
him
with
a
large
force
to
take
possession
of
his
bishopric
apollinarius
marched
into
alexandria
in
full
military
dress
at
the
head
of
his
troops
but
when
he
entered
the
church
he
laid
aside
his
arms
and
putting
on
the
patriarchal
robes
began
to
celebrate
the
rites
of
his
religion
the
alexandrians
were
by
no
means
overawed
by
the
force
with
which
he
had
entered
the
city
they
pelted
him
with
a
shower
of
stones
from
every
corner
of
the
church
and
he
was
forced
to
withdraw
from
the
building
in
order
to
save
his
life
but
three
days
afterwards
the
bells
were
rung
through
the
city
and
the
people
were
summoned
to
meet
in
the
church
on
the
following
sunday
to
hear
the
letter
read
when
sunday
came
the
whole
city
flocked
to
hear
and
to
disobey
orders
apollinarius
began
his
address
by
threatening
his
hearers
that
if
they
continued
obstinate
in
their
opinions
their
children
should
be
made
orphans
and
their
widows
given
up
to
the
soldiery
and
he
was
as
before
stopped
with
a
shower
of
stones
but
this
time
he
was
prepared
for
the
attack
this
christian
bishop
had
placed
his
troops
in
ambush
round
the
church
and
on
a
signal
given
they
rushed
out
on
his
unarmed
flock
and
by
his
orders
the
crowds
within
and
without
the
church
were
put
to
rout
by
the
sword
the
soldiers
waded
up
to
their
knees
in
blood
and
the
city
and
whole
country
yielded
its
obedience
for
the
time
to
bishops
who
held
the
greek
faith
henceforth
the
melchite
or
royalist
patriarchs
who
were
appointed
by
the
emperor
and
had
the
authority
of
civil
prefects
and
were
supported
by
the
power
of
the
military
prefect
are
scarcely
mentioned
by
the
historian
of
the
koptic
church
they
were
too
much
engaged
in
civil
affairs
to
act
the
part
of
ministers
of
religion
they
collected
their
revenues
principally
in
grain
and
carried
on
a
large
export
trade
transporting
their
stores
to
those
parts
of
europe
where
they
would
bring
the
best
price
on
one
occasion
we
hear
of
a
small
fleet
belonging
to
the
church
of
alexandria
consisting
of
thirteen
ships
of
about
thirty
tons
burden
each
and
bearing
ten
thousand
bushels
of
grain
being
overtaken
by
a
storm
on
the
coast
of
italy
the
princely
income
of
the
later
patriarchs
raised
from
the
churches
of
all
egypt
under
the
name
of
the
offerings
of
the
pious
sometimes
amounted
to
two
thousand
pounds
of
gold
or
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
but
while
these
melchite
or
royalist
bishops
were
enjoying
the
ecclesiastical
revenues
and
administering
the
civil
affairs
of
the
diocese
and
of
the
great
monasteries
there
was
a
second
bishop
who
held
the
jacobite
faith
and
who
having
been
elected
by
the
people
according
to
the
ancient
forms
of
the
church
equally
bore
the
title
of
patriarch
and
administered
in
his
more
humble
path
to
the
spiritual
wants
of
his
flock
the
jacobite
bishop
was
always
a
monk
at
his
ordination
he
was
declared
to
be
elected
by
the
popular
voice
by
the
bishops
priests
deacons
monks
and
all
the
people
of
lower
egypt
and
prayers
were
offered
up
through
the
intercession
of
the
mother
of
god
and
of
the
glorious
apostle
mark
the
two
churches
no
longer
used
the
same
the
melchite
church
continued
to
use
the
old
liturgy
which
as
it
had
been
read
in
alexandria
from
time
immemorial
was
called
the
liturgy
of
mark
altered
however
to
declare
that
the
son
was
of
the
same
substance
with
the
father
but
the
koptic
church
made
use
of
the
newer
liturgies
by
their
own
champions
bishop
cyril
basil
of
cæsaræ
and
gregory
nazianzen
these
three
liturgies
were
all
in
the
koptic
language
and
more
clearly
denied
the
two
natures
of
christ
of
the
two
churches
the
koptic
had
less
learning
more
bigotry
and
opinions
more
removed
from
the
teachings
of
the
new
testament
but
then
the
koptic
bishop
alone
had
any
moral
power
to
lead
the
minds
of
his
flock
towards
piety
and
religion
had
the
emperors
been
at
all
times
either
humane
or
politic
enough
to
employ
bishops
of
the
same
religion
as
the
people
they
would
perhaps
have
kept
the
of
their
subjects
but
as
it
was
the
koptic
church
smarting
under
its
insults
and
forgetting
the
greater
evils
of
a
foreign
conquest
would
sometimes
look
with
longing
eyes
to
the
condition
of
their
neighbours
their
brethren
in
faith
the
arabic
subjects
of
persia
the
christianity
of
the
egyptians
was
mostly
superstition
and
as
it
spread
over
the
land
it
embraced
the
whole
nation
within
its
pale
not
so
much
by
purifying
the
pagan
opinions
as
by
lowering
itself
to
their
level
and
fitting
itself
to
their
corporeal
notions
of
the
creator
this
was
in
a
large
measure
induced
by
the
custom
of
using
the
old
temples
for
christian
churches
the
form
of
worship
was
in
part
guided
by
the
form
of
the
building
and
even
the
old
traditions
were
engrafted
on
the
new
religion
thus
the
traveller
antonius
after
visiting
the
remarkable
places
in
the
holy
land
came
to
egypt
to
search
for
the
chariots
of
the
egyptians
who
pursued
moses
petrified
into
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
red
sea
and
for
the
footsteps
left
in
the
sands
by
the
infant
jesus
while
he
dwelt
in
egypt
with
his
parents
at
memphis
he
enquired
why
one
of
the
doors
in
the
great
temple
of
phtah
then
used
as
a
church
was
always
closed
and
he
was
told
that
it
had
been
rudely
shut
against
the
infant
jesus
five
hundred
years
before
and
mortal
strength
had
never
since
been
able
to
open
it
the
records
of
the
empire
declared
that
the
first
cæsars
had
kept
six
hundred
and
thousand
men
under
arms
to
guard
italy
africa
spain
and
egypt
a
number
perhaps
much
larger
than
the
truth
but
justinian
could
with
difficulty
maintain
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
troops
a
force
far
from
large
enough
to
hold
even
those
provinces
that
remained
to
him
during
the
latter
half
of
his
reign
the
eastern
frontier
of
this
falling
empire
was
sorely
harassed
by
the
persians
under
their
king
chosroes
they
overran
syria
defeated
the
army
of
the
empire
in
a
pitched
battle
and
then
took
antioch
by
these
defeats
the
military
roads
were
stopped
egypt
was
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
empire
and
could
be
reached
from
the
capital
only
by
sea
hence
the
emperor
was
driven
to
a
change
in
his
religious
policy
he
gave
over
the
persecution
of
the
jacobite
opinions
and
even
went
so
far
in
one
of
his
decrees
as
to
call
the
body
of
jesus
incorruptible
as
he
thought
that
these
were
the
only
means
of
keeping
the
allegiance
of
his
subjects
or
the
friendship
of
his
arab
neighbours
all
of
whom
as
far
as
they
were
christians
held
the
jacobite
view
of
the
nicene
creed
and
denied
the
two
natures
of
christ
as
the
forces
of
constantinople
were
driven
back
by
the
victorious
armies
of
the
persians
the
emperors
had
lost
among
other
fortresses
the
capital
of
arabia
nabataæ
that
curious
rocky
fastness
that
well
deserved
the
name
of
petra
and
which
had
been
garrisoned
by
romans
from
the
reign
of
trajan
till
that
of
valens
on
this
loss
it
became
necessary
to
fortify
a
new
frontier
post
on
the
egyptian
side
of
the
elanitic
gulf
justinian
then
built
the
fortified
monastery
near
mount
sinai
to
guard
the
only
pass
by
which
egypt
could
be
entered
without
the
help
of
a
fleet
and
when
it
was
found
to
be
commanded
by
one
of
the
higher
points
of
the
mountain
he
beheaded
the
engineer
who
built
it
and
remedied
the
fault
as
far
as
it
could
be
done
by
a
small
fortress
on
the
higher
ground
this
monastery
was
held
by
the
egyptians
and
maintained
out
of
the
egyptian
taxes
when
the
egyptians
were
formerly
masters
of
their
own
country
before
the
persian
and
greek
conquests
they
were
governed
by
a
race
of
priests
and
the
temples
were
their
only
fortresses
illustration
fortress
near
mount
sinai
the
temples
of
thebes
were
the
citadels
of
the
capital
and
the
temples
of
elephantine
guarded
the
frontier
so
now
when
the
military
prefect
is
too
weak
to
make
himself
obeyed
the
emperor
tries
to
govern
through
means
of
the
christian
priesthood
and
when
it
is
necessary
for
the
egyptians
to
defend
their
own
frontier
he
builds
a
monastery
and
garrisons
it
with
monks
part
of
the
egyptian
trade
to
the
east
was
carried
on
through
the
islands
of
ceylon
and
socotra
but
it
was
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
uneducated
arabs
of
ethiopia
who
were
little
able
to
communicate
to
the
world
much
knowledge
of
the
countries
from
which
they
brought
their
highly
valued
goods
at
ceylon
they
met
with
traders
from
beyond
the
ganges
and
from
china
of
whom
they
bought
the
silk
which
europeans
had
formerly
thought
a
product
of
arabia
at
ceylon
was
a
christian
church
with
a
priest
and
a
deacon
frequented
by
the
christians
from
persia
while
the
natives
of
the
place
were
pagans
the
coins
there
used
were
roman
borne
thither
by
the
course
of
trade
which
during
so
many
centuries
carried
the
gold
and
silver
eastward
the
trade
was
lately
turned
more
strongly
into
this
channel
because
a
war
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
tribes
of
jewish
arabs
the
hexumitæ
of
abyssinia
on
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
near
adule
and
the
homeritæ
who
dwelt
in
arabia
on
the
opposite
coast
at
the
southern
end
of
the
red
sea
the
homeritæ
had
quarrelled
with
the
alexandrian
merchants
in
the
indian
trade
and
had
killed
some
of
them
as
they
were
passing
their
mountains
from
india
to
the
country
of
the
hexumitae
immediately
after
these
murders
the
hexumitæ
found
the
trade
injured
and
they
took
up
arms
to
keep
the
passage
open
for
the
merchants
hadad
their
king
crossed
the
red
sea
and
conquered
his
enemies
he
put
to
death
damianus
the
king
of
the
homeritse
and
made
a
new
treaty
with
the
emperor
of
constantinople
the
hexumitæ
promised
to
become
christians
they
sent
to
alexandria
to
beg
for
a
priest
to
baptise
them
and
to
ordain
their
preachers
and
justinian
sent
john
a
man
of
piety
and
high
character
the
dean
of
the
church
of
john
who
returned
with
the
ambassadors
and
became
bishop
of
the
hexumitae
it
was
possibly
this
conquest
of
the
homeritae
by
hadad
king
of
the
hexumitae
which
was
recorded
on
the
monument
of
adule
at
the
foot
of
the
inscription
set
up
eight
centuries
earlier
by
ptolemy
euergetes
the
monument
is
a
throne
of
white
marble
the
conqueror
whose
name
had
been
broken
away
before
the
inscription
was
copied
there
boasts
that
he
crossed
over
the
red
sea
and
made
the
arabians
and
sabaaans
pay
him
tribute
on
his
own
continent
he
defeated
the
tribes
to
the
north
of
him
and
opened
the
passage
from
his
own
country
to
egypt
he
also
marched
eastward
and
conquered
the
tribes
on
the
african
incense
coast
and
lastly
he
crossed
the
astaborus
to
the
snowy
mountains
in
which
that
branch
of
the
nile
rises
and
conquered
the
tribes
between
that
stream
and
the
astapus
this
valuable
inscription
which
tells
us
of
snowy
mountains
within
the
tropics
was
copied
by
cosmas
a
merchant
of
alexandria
who
passed
through
adule
on
his
way
to
india
former
emperors
anastasius
and
justin
had
sent
several
embassies
to
these
nations
at
the
southern
end
of
the
red
sea
to
the
homeritae
to
persuade
them
to
attack
the
persian
forces
in
arabia
and
to
the
hexumitae
for
the
encouragement
of
trade
justinian
also
sent
an
embassy
to
the
homeritae
under
abram
and
as
he
was
successful
in
his
object
he
entrusted
a
second
embassy
to
son
nonnosus
landed
at
adule
on
the
abyssinian
coast
and
then
travelled
inward
for
fifteen
days
to
auxum
the
capital
this
country
was
then
called
ethiopia
it
had
gained
the
name
which
before
belonged
to
the
valley
of
the
nile
between
egypt
and
meroë
on
his
way
to
auxum
he
saw
troops
of
wild
elephants
to
the
number
as
he
supposed
of
five
thousand
after
delivering
his
message
to
elesbaas
then
king
of
auxum
he
crossed
the
red
sea
to
caisus
king
of
the
homeritæ
a
grandson
of
that
arethas
to
whom
justin
had
sent
his
embassy
notwithstanding
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
journey
and
those
arising
from
the
tribes
through
which
he
had
to
pass
nonnosus
performed
his
task
successfully
and
on
his
return
home
wrote
a
history
of
his
embassies
the
advantage
gained
to
the
hexumitæ
by
their
invasion
of
the
homeritæ
was
soon
lost
probably
as
soon
as
their
forces
were
withdrawn
the
trade
through
the
country
of
the
homeritae
was
again
stopped
and
such
was
the
difficulty
of
navigation
from
the
incense
coast
of
africa
to
the
mouths
of
the
indus
that
the
loss
was
severely
felt
at
auxum
elesbæs
therefore
undertook
to
repeat
the
punishment
which
had
been
before
inflicted
on
his
less
civilised
neighbours
and
again
to
open
the
trade
to
the
merchants
from
the
nile
it
was
while
he
was
preparing
his
forces
for
this
invasion
that
cosmas
the
alexandrian
traveller
passed
through
adule
and
he
copied
for
the
king
of
auxum
the
inscription
above
spoken
of
which
recorded
the
victories
of
his
predecessor
over
the
enemies
he
was
himself
preparing
to
attack
the
invasion
by
elesbæs
or
elesthæus
as
he
is
also
named
was
immediately
successful
the
homeritæ
were
conquered
their
ruler
was
overthrown
and
to
secure
their
future
obedience
the
conqueror
set
over
these
jewish
arabs
an
abyssinian
christian
for
their
king
esimaphæus
was
chosen
for
that
post
and
his
first
duty
was
to
convert
his
new
subjects
to
christianity
political
reasons
as
well
as
religious
zeal
would
urge
him
to
this
undertaking
to
make
the
conquered
bear
the
badge
of
the
conqueror
for
this
purpose
he
engaged
the
assistance
of
gregentius
a
bishop
who
was
to
employ
his
learning
and
eloquence
in
the
cause
accordingly
in
the
palace
of
threlletum
in
the
presence
of
their
new
king
a
public
dispute
was
held
between
the
christian
bishop
and
herban
a
learned
jew
gregentius
has
left
us
an
account
of
the
controversy
in
which
he
was
wholly
successful
being
helped
perhaps
by
the
threats
and
promises
of
the
king
the
arguments
used
were
not
quite
the
same
as
they
would
be
now
the
bishop
explained
the
trinity
as
the
holy
spirit
proceeding
from
the
mind
or
father
and
resting
on
the
word
or
son
which
was
then
the
orthodox
view
of
this
mysterious
doctrine
on
the
other
hand
the
jew
quoted
the
old
testament
to
show
that
the
lord
their
god
was
one
lord
it
is
related
that
suddenly
the
jews
present
were
struck
blind
their
sight
however
was
restored
to
them
on
the
praying
for
them
and
they
were
then
all
thereby
converted
and
baptised
on
the
spot
the
king
stood
godfather
to
herban
and
rewarded
him
with
a
high
office
under
his
government
illustration
pyramid
of
medum
esimaphasus
did
not
long
remain
king
of
the
homeritæ
a
rebellion
soon
broke
out
against
him
and
he
was
deposed
elesbaas
king
of
auxum
again
sent
an
army
to
recall
the
homeritæ
to
their
obedience
but
this
time
the
army
joined
in
the
revolt
and
elesbæ
then
made
peace
with
the
enemy
in
hopes
of
thus
gaining
the
advantages
which
he
was
unable
to
grasp
by
force
of
arms
from
a
greek
inscription
on
a
monument
at
auxum
we
learn
the
name
of
æizanas
another
king
of
that
country
who
also
called
himself
either
truly
or
boastfully
king
of
the
opposite
coast
he
set
up
the
monument
to
record
his
victories
over
the
bougoto
a
people
who
dwelt
between
auxum
and
egypt
and
he
styles
himself
the
invincible
mars
king
of
kings
king
of
the
hexumito
of
the
ethiopians
of
the
saboans
and
of
the
homerito
these
kings
of
the
hexumito
ornamented
the
city
of
auxum
with
several
beautiful
and
lofty
obelisks
each
made
of
a
single
block
of
granite
like
those
in
egypt
egypt
in
its
mismanaged
state
seemed
to
be
of
little
value
to
the
empire
save
as
a
means
of
enriching
the
prefect
and
the
it
yielded
very
little
tribute
to
constantinople
beyond
the
supply
of
grain
and
that
by
no
means
regularly
to
remedy
these
abuses
justinian
made
a
new
law
for
the
government
of
the
province
with
a
view
of
bringing
about
a
thorough
reform
by
this
edict
the
districts
of
menelaites
and
mareotis
to
the
west
of
alexandria
were
separated
from
the
rest
of
egypt
and
they
were
given
to
the
prefect
of
libya
whose
seat
of
government
was
at
parotonium
because
his
province
was
too
poor
to
pay
the
troops
required
to
guard
it
the
several
governments
of
upper
egypt
of
lower
egypt
of
alexandria
and
of
the
troops
were
then
given
to
one
prefect
the
two
cohorts
the
augustalian
and
the
ducal
into
which
the
two
boman
legions
had
gradually
dwindled
were
henceforth
to
be
united
under
the
name
of
the
augustalian
cohort
which
was
to
contain
six
hundred
men
who
were
to
secure
the
obedience
and
put
down
any
rebellion
of
the
egyptian
and
barbarian
soldiers
the
somewhat
high
pay
and
privileges
of
this
favoured
troop
were
to
be
increased
and
to
secure
its
loyalty
and
to
keep
out
egyptians
nobody
was
to
be
admitted
into
it
till
his
fitness
had
been
inquired
into
by
the
examiners
the
first
duty
of
the
cohort
was
to
collect
the
supply
of
grain
for
constantinople
and
to
see
it
put
on
board
the
ships
and
as
for
the
supply
which
was
promised
to
the
alexandrians
the
magistrates
were
to
collect
it
at
their
own
risk
and
by
means
of
their
own
cohort
the
grain
for
constantinople
was
required
to
be
in
that
city
before
the
end
of
august
or
within
four
months
after
the
harvest
and
the
supply
for
alexandria
not
more
than
a
month
later
the
prefect
was
made
answerable
for
the
full
collection
and
whatever
was
wanting
of
that
quantity
was
to
be
levied
on
his
property
and
his
heirs
at
the
rate
of
one
solidus
for
three
artabo
of
grain
or
about
three
dollars
for
fifteen
bushels
while
in
order
to
help
the
collection
the
export
of
grain
from
egypt
was
forbidden
from
every
port
but
alexandria
except
in
small
quantities
the
grain
required
for
alexandria
and
constantinople
to
be
distributed
as
a
free
gift
among
the
idle
citizens
was
eight
hundred
thousand
artabo
or
four
millions
of
bushels
and
the
cost
of
collecting
it
was
fixed
at
eighty
thousand
solidi
or
about
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
prefect
was
ordered
to
assist
the
collectors
at
the
head
of
his
cohort
and
if
he
gave
credit
for
the
taxes
which
he
was
to
collect
he
was
to
bear
the
loss
himself
if
the
archbishop
interfered
to
give
credit
and
screen
an
unhappy
egyptian
then
he
was
to
bear
the
loss
and
if
his
property
was
not
enough
the
property
of
the
church
was
to
make
it
good
but
if
any
other
bishop
gave
credit
not
only
was
his
property
to
bear
the
loss
but
he
was
himself
to
be
deposed
from
his
bishopric
and
lastly
if
any
riot
or
rebellion
should
arise
to
cause
the
loss
of
the
egyptian
tribute
the
tribunes
of
the
augustalian
cohort
were
to
be
punished
with
forfeiture
of
all
property
and
the
cohort
was
to
be
removed
to
a
station
beyond
the
danube
such
was
the
new
law
which
justinian
the
great
roman
lawgiver
proposed
for
the
future
government
of
egypt
the
egyptians
were
treated
as
slaves
whose
duty
was
to
raise
grain
for
the
use
of
their
masters
at
constantinople
and
their
taskmasters
at
alexandria
they
did
not
even
receive
from
the
government
the
usual
benefit
of
protection
from
their
enemies
and
they
felt
bound
to
the
emperor
by
no
tie
either
of
love
or
interest
the
imperial
orders
wrere
very
little
obeyed
beyond
those
places
where
the
troops
were
encamped
the
arabs
were
each
year
pressing
closer
upon
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
helping
the
sands
of
the
desert
to
defeat
the
labours
of
the
disheartened
husbandmen
and
the
greek
language
which
had
hitherto
followed
and
marked
the
route
of
commerce
from
alexandria
to
syênê
and
to
the
island
of
socotra
was
now
but
seldom
heard
in
upper
egypt
the
alexandrians
were
sorely
harassed
by
haephasstus
a
lawyer
who
had
risen
by
court
favour
to
the
chief
post
in
the
city
he
made
monopolies
in
his
own
favour
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
and
secured
his
gains
by
ready
loans
of
part
of
it
to
justinian
his
zeal
for
the
emperor
was
at
the
cost
of
the
alexandrians
and
to
save
the
public
granaries
he
lessened
the
supply
of
grain
which
the
citizens
looked
for
as
a
right
the
city
was
sinking
fast
and
the
citizens
could
ill
bear
this
loss
for
its
population
though
lessened
was
still
too
large
for
the
fallen
state
of
egypt
the
grain
of
the
merchants
was
shipped
from
alexandria
to
the
chief
ports
of
europe
between
constantinople
in
the
east
and
cornwall
in
the
west
britain
had
been
left
by
the
romans
as
too
remote
for
them
to
hold
in
their
weakened
condition
and
the
native
britons
were
then
struggling
against
their
saxon
invaders
as
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
world
beyond
the
knowledge
of
the
historian
but
to
that
remote
country
the
alexandrian
merchants
sailed
every
year
with
grain
to
purchase
tin
enlightening
the
natives
while
they
only
meant
to
enrich
themselves
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
they
sometimes
performed
the
voyage
in
twenty
days
the
wheat
was
sold
in
cornwall
at
the
price
of
a
bushel
for
a
piece
of
silver
perhaps
worth
about
twenty
cents
or
for
the
same
weight
of
tin
as
the
tin
and
the
silver
were
nearly
of
equal
worth
this
was
the
longest
of
the
ancient
voyages
being
longer
than
that
from
the
red
sea
to
the
island
of
ceylon
in
the
indian
ocean
and
it
had
been
regularly
performed
for
at
least
eight
centuries
without
ever
teaching
the
british
to
venture
so
far
from
their
native
shores
the
suffering
and
riotous
citizens
made
alexandria
a
very
unpleasant
place
of
abode
for
the
prefect
and
magistrates
they
therefore
built
palaces
and
baths
for
their
own
use
at
the
public
cost
at
taposiris
about
a
journey
to
the
west
of
the
city
at
a
spot
yet
marked
by
the
remains
of
marble
columns
and
a
lofty
tower
once
perhaps
a
lighthouse
at
the
same
time
it
became
necessary
to
fortify
the
public
granaries
against
the
rebellious
mob
the
grain
was
brought
from
the
nile
by
barges
on
a
canal
to
the
village
of
chaereum
and
thence
to
a
part
of
alexandria
named
phialæ
or
where
the
public
granaries
stood
in
all
riots
and
rebellions
this
place
had
been
a
natural
point
of
attack
and
often
had
the
starving
mob
broken
open
these
buildings
and
seized
the
grain
that
was
on
its
way
to
constantinople
but
justinian
surrounded
them
with
a
strong
wall
against
such
attacks
for
the
future
and
at
the
same
time
he
rebuilt
the
aqueduct
that
had
been
destroyed
in
one
of
the
sieges
of
the
city
in
civil
suits
at
law
an
appeal
had
always
been
allowed
from
the
prefect
of
the
province
to
the
emperor
or
rather
to
the
prefect
of
the
east
at
constantinople
but
as
this
was
of
course
expensive
it
was
found
necessary
to
forbid
it
when
the
sum
of
money
in
dispute
was
small
justinian
forbade
all
egyptian
appeals
for
sums
less
than
ten
pounds
weight
of
gold
or
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
smaller
sums
the
judgment
of
the
prefect
was
to
be
final
lest
the
expense
should
swallow
up
the
amount
in
dispute
in
this
reign
the
alexandrians
for
the
first
time
within
the
records
of
history
felt
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
their
naturalists
had
very
fairly
supposed
that
the
loose
alluvial
nature
of
the
soil
of
the
delta
was
the
reason
why
earthquakes
were
unknown
in
lower
egypt
and
believed
that
it
would
always
save
them
from
a
misfortune
which
often
overthrew
cities
in
other
countries
pliny
thought
that
egypt

this
shock
was

city

the
byzantine
historian
who
after
reading
law
in
the
university
of
beirut
was
finishing
his
studies
at
alexandria
says
that
it
was
strong
enough
to
make
the
inhabitants
all
run
into
the
street
for
fear
the
houses
should
fall
upon
them
the
reign
of
justinian
is
remarkable
for
another
blow
then
given
to
paganism
throughout
the
empire
or
at
least
through
those
parts
of
the
empire
where
the
laws
were
obeyed

had
left

school
to

pupil

salustius
the
cynic
was
a
syrian
who
had
removed
with
isidorus
from
athens
to
alexandria
he
was
virtuous
in
his
morals
though
jocular
in
his
manners
and
as
ready
in
his
witty
attacks
upon
the
speculative
opinions
of
his
brother
philosophers
as
upon
the
vices
of
the
alexandrians
these
learned
men
with
damascius
and
others
from
athens
were
kindly
received
by
the
persians
who
soon
afterwards
when
they
made
a
treaty
of
peace
with
justinian
generously
bargained
that
these
men
the
last
teachers
of
paganism
should
be
allowed
to
return
home
and
pass
the
rest
of
their
days
in
quiet
after
the
flight
of
the
pagan
philosophers
but
little
learning
was
left
in
alexandria
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
this
age
of
ignorance
was
cosmas
an
alexandrian
merchant
who
wished
that
the
world
should
not
only
be
enriched
but
enlightened
by
his
travels
after
making
many
voyages
through
ethiopia
to
india
for
the
sake
of
gain
he
gave
up
trade
and
became
a
monk
and
an
author
when
he
writes
as
a
traveller
about
the
christian
churches
of
india
and
ceylon
and
the
inscriptions
which
he
copied
at
adule
in
abyssinia
everything
that
he
tells
us
is
valuable
but
when
he
reasons
as
a
monk
the
case
is
sadly
changed
he
is
of
the
dogmatical
school
which
forbids
all
inquiry
as
heretical
he
fights
the
battle
which
has
been
so
often
fought
before
and
since
and
is
even
still
fought
so
resolutely
the
battle
of
religious
ignorance
against
scientific
knowledge
he
sets
the
words
of
the
bible
against
the
results
of
science
he
denies
that
the
world
is
a
sphere
and
quotes
the
old
testament
against
the
pagan
astronomers
to
show
that
it
is
a
plane
covered
by
the
firmament
as
by
a
roof
above
which
he
places
the
kingdom
of
heaven
his
work
is
named
and
he
is
himself
usually
called
cosmas
indicopleustes
from
the
country
which
he
visited
during
the
latter
years
of
the
government
of
apollinarius
such
was
his
unpopularity
as
a
spiritual
bishop
that
both
the
rival
parties
the
gaianites
and
the
theodosians
had
been
building
places
of
worship
for
themselves
and
the
more
zealous
jacobites
had
quietly
left
the
churches
to
apollinarius
and
the
royalists
but
on
the
death
of
an
archdeacon
they
again
came
to
blows
with
the
bishop
and
a
monk
had
his
beard
torn
off
his
chin
by
the
gaianites
in
the
streets
of
alexandria
the
emperor
was
obliged
to
interfere
and
he
sent
the
abbot
photinus
to
egypt
to
put
down
this
rebellion
and
heal
the
quarrel
in
the
church
apollinarius
died
soon
afterwards
and
justinian
then
appointed
john
to
the
joint
office
of
prefect
of
the
city
and
patriarch
of
the
church
the
new
archbishop
was
accused
of
being
a
manichean
but
this
seems
to
mean
nothing
but
that
he
was
too
much
of
the
egyptian
party
and
that
though
he
was
the
imperial
patriarch
and
not
acknowledged
by
the
koptic
church
yet
his
opinions
were
disliked
by
the
greeks
on
his
death
which
happened
in
about
three
years
they
chose
peter
who
held
the
jacobite
or
egyptian
opinions
and
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
in
the
greek
lists
of
the
patriarchs
death
occurred
in
the
same
year
as
that
of
the
emperor
under
justinian
we
again
find
some
small
traces
of
a
national
coinage
in
egypt
ever
since
the
reign
of
diocletian
the
old
egyptian
coinage
had
been
stopped
and
the
alexandrians
had
used
money
of
the
same
weight
and
with
the
same
latin
inscriptions
as
the
rest
of
the
empire
but
under
justinian
though
the
inscriptions
on
the
coins
are
still
latin
they
have
the
name
of
the
city
in
greek
letters
like
the
coins
of
constantinople
they
have
a
cross
the
emblem
of
christianity
but
while
the
other
coins
of
the
empire
have
the
greek
numeral
letters
e
i
k
a
or
m
to
denote
the
value
meaning
or
the
coins
of
alexandria
have
the
letters
b
for
showing
that
they
were
on
a
different
system
of
weights
from
those
of
constantinople
on
these
the
head
of
the
emperor
is
in
profile
but
later
in
his
reign
the
style
was
changed
the
coins
were
made
larger
and
the
head
of
the
emperor
had
a
front
face
on
these
larger
coins
the
numeral
letters
are
a
r
for
we
thus
learn
that
the
alexandrians
at
this
time
paid
and
received
money
rather
by
weight
than
by
tale
and
avoided
all
depreciation
of
the
currency
as
the
early
coins
marked
had
become
lighter
by
wear

were

under

the

lost

of

received

grain
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
was
starving
the
larger
cities

the
population

was
suffering
from
want

employment
the
civil
magistrates
had
removed
their
palace
to

the
new
bishop
seemed
formed
for

unfortunate
times

though
appointed
by
the
emperor
he
was
in
every
respect
worthy
of
the
free
choice
of
the
citizens
he
was
foremost
in
every
work
of
benevolence
and
charity
the
five
years
of
his
government
were
spent
in
lightening
the
sufferings
of
the

he
gained
the
truly
christian
name
of
john

established

successes

workmen
to
assist
in
the
pious
work
of
rebuilding
the
church
of
jerusalem
which
the
persians
had
destroyed
immediately
found
all
his
means
needed
and
far
from
enough
for
the
poor
of
alexandria
on
his
appointment
to
the
bishopric
he
found
in
its
treasury
eight
thousand
pounds
of
gold
he
had
in

course
of
five
years
received
ten
thousand
more
from
the
offerings
of
the
pious
as
his
princely
ecclesiastical
revenue
was
named
but
this
large
sum
of
four
million
dollars
had
all
been
spent
in
deeds
of
generosity
or
charity
and
the
bishop
had
no
resource
but
borrowing
to
relieve
the
misery
with
which
he
was
surrounded
in
the
fifth
year
the
unbelievers
were
masters
of
jerusalem
and
in
the
eighth
they
entered
alexandria

soon
held
all
the
delta
and
in
that
year
the
grain
which
had
hitherto
been
given
to
the
citizens
of
constantinople
was
sold
to
them
at
a
small
price
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
supply
from
egypt
was
wholly
stopped
when
the
persians
entered
egypt
the
patrician
nicetas
having
no
forces
with
which
he
could
withstand
their
advance
and
knowing
that
no
succour
was
to
be
looked
for
from
constantinople
and
finding
that
the
alexandrians
were
unwilling
to
support
him
fled
with
the
patriarch
john
the
almsgiver
to
cyprus
and
left
the
province
to
the
enemy
as
john
denied
that
the
son
of
god
had
suffered
on
the
cross
his
opinions
would
seem
not
to
have
been
very
unlike
those
of
the
egyptians
but
as
he
was
appointed
to
the
bishopric
by
the
emperor
though
at
the
request
of
the
people
he
is
not
counted
among
the
patriarchs
of
the
koptic
church
and
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
persians
was
to
appoint
benjamin
a
jacobite
priest
who
already
performed
the
spiritual
office
of
bishop
of
alexandria
to
the
public
exercise
of
that
duty
and
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
civil
dignity
and
revenues
the
troops
with
which
chosroes
conquered
and
held
egypt
were
no

in

syrians
and
arabs
people
with
whom
the
fellahs
or
labouring
class
of
egyptians
were
closely
allied
in
blood

feelings
hence
arose
the
readiness
with
which
the
whole
country
yielded
when
the
roman
forces
were
defeated

hence
also
arose
the
weakness
of
the
persians

this
conquest

bishop
came
to
alexandria
to
correct
the
syriac
version
of
the
new
testament
which
had
been
made
about
a
century
before
by
philoxenus

compared
the
gospels
acts
and
epistles
with

greek
manuscripts
in
the
monastery
of
anthony
in

capital
and
we
still
possess
the
fruits
of
his
learned
labour
in
which
he
altered
the
ancient
text
to
make
it
agree
with
the
newer
alexandrian
manuscripts
from
his
copy

philoxenian
version
is
now
printed
a
syriac
manuscript
of
the
new
testament
written
by
alexandrian
penmen
in

sixth
year
of
heraclius
is
now
to
be
seen
in
the
library
of
the
augustan
friars
in

at
the
same
time
another
syrian
scholar
paul
of
tela
in

was
busy
in
the
alexandrian
monastery
of
zacchæus
in
translating
the
old
testament
into
syriac
from
the
septuagint
greek
and
he
closes
his
labours
with
begging
the
reader
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
his
friend
thomas
such
was
now
the
reputation
of
the
alexandrian
edition
of
the
bible
that
these
scholars
preferred
it
both
to
the
original
hebrew
of
the
old
and
to
the
earlier
manuscripts
of
the
new
testament
among
other
works
of
this

how
quietly
they
lived

leading

forces
bravely
against

drove
him
back
from

turn
the

earliest
years
in
the
desert
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
travelled
with
a
caravan
to
syria
and
probably
on
this
occasion
first
came
into
contact
with
the
jews
and
christians
after
a
few
youthful
adventures
his
poetic
and
religious
feelings
were
awakened
by
study
he
gave
himself
up
to
profound
meditation
upon
both
the
jewish
and
christian
ideals
and
subsequently
beholding
the
archangel
gabriel
in
a
vision
he
proclaimed
himself
as
a
prophet
of
god
after
preaching
his
doctrine
for
three
years
and
gaining
a
few
converts
the
first
of
whom
was
his
wife
khadija
the
people
of
mecca
rose
against
him
and
he
was
forced
to
flee
from
the
city
in
new
visions
and
subsequent
conversions
of
influential
arabs
strengthened
his
cause
especially
in
medina
whither
muhammed
was
forced
to
flee
a
second
time
from
mecca
in
this
second
flight
being
known
as
the
hegira
from
which
dates
the
muhammedan
era
in
the
next
year
at
medina
he
built
his
first
mosque
and
married
ayesha
and
in
was
compelled
to
defend
his
pretensions
by
an
appeal
to
arms
he
was
at
first
successful
and
thereupon
appointed
friday
as
a
day
of
public
worship
and
being
embittered
against
the
jews
ordered
that
the
attitude
of
prayer
should
no
longer
be
towards
jerusalem
but
towards
his
birthplace
mecca
in
the
muhammedans
were
defeated
by
the
meccans
but
one
tribe
after
another
submitted
to
him
and
after
a
series
of
victories
muhammed
prepared
in
for
further
conquests
in
syria
but
he
died
in
before
they
could
be
accomplished
his
successors
were
known
as
caliphs
but
from
the
very
first
his
disciples
quarrelled
about
the
leadership
some
affirming
the
rights
of
ali
who
had
married
daughter
fatima
and
others
supporting
the
claims
of
abu
bekr
his
there
was
also
a
religious
quarrel
concerning
certain
oral
traditions
relating
to
the
koran
or
the
muhammedan
sacred
scriptures
those
who
accepted
the
tradition
were
known
as
sunnites
and
those
who
rejected
it
as
shiites
the
latter
being
the
supporters
of
ali
both
sects
however
being
known
as
moslems
or
islamites
omar
a
sunnite
obtained
the
leadership
in
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
ambitious
schemes
of
conquest
he
subdued
successively
syria
palestine
and
phoenicia
and
in
directed
operations
against
egypt
the
general
in
charge
of
this
expedition
was
amr
who
led
four
thousand
men
against
pelusium
which
surrendered
after
a
siege
of
thirty
days
this
easy
victory
was
crowned
by
the
capture
of
alexandria
amr
entered
the
city
on
december
and
he
seems
to
have
been
surprised
at
his
own
success
he
immediately
wrote
to
the
caliph
a
letter
in
which
he
says
have
conquered
the
town
of
the
west
and
i
can
not
recount
all
it
contains
within
its
walls
it
contains
four
thousand
baths
and
twelve
thousand
venders
of
green
vegetables
four
thousand
jews
who
pay
tribute
and
four
thousand
musicians
and
amr
was
anxious
to
conciliate
and
gain
the
affection
of
the
new
subjects
he
had
added
to
the
empire
and
during
his
short
stay
in
alexandria
received
them
with
kindness
and
personally
heard
and
attended
to
their
demands
it
is
commonly
believed
that
in
this
period
the
alexandrian
library
was
dismantled
but
as
we
have
already
seen
the
books
had
been
destroyed
by
the
zeal
of
contending
christians
the
story
that
attributes
the
destruction
of
this
institution
to
the
arabian
conquerors
is
so
much
a
part
of
history
and
has
been
so
generally
accepted
as
correct
that
the
traditional
version
should
be
given
here
among
the
inhabitants
of
alexandria
whom
amr
had
so
well
received
says
the
monkish
chronicler
was
one
john
the
grammarian
a
learned
greek
disciple
of
the
jacobite
sect
who
had
been
imprisoned
by
its
persecutors
since
his
disgrace
he
had
given
himself
up
entirely
to
study
and
was
one
of
the
most
assiduous
readers
in
the
famous
library
with
the
change
of
masters
he
believed
the
rich
treasure
would
be
speedily
dispersed
and
he
wished
to
obtain
a
portion
of
it
himself
so
profiting
by
the
special
kindness
amr
had
shown
him
and
the
pleasure
he
appeared
to
take
in
his
conversation
he
ventured
to
ask
for
the
gift
of
several
of
the
philosophic
books
whose
removal
would
put
an
end
to
his
learned
researches
at
first
amr
granted
this
request
without
hesitation
but
in
his
gratitude
john
the
grammarian
expatiated
so
unwisely
on
the
extreme
rarity
of
the
manuscripts
and
their
inestimable
value
that
amr
on
reflection
feared
he
had
overstepped
his
power
in
granting
the
learned
request
will
refer
the
matter
to
the
caliph
he
said
and
thereupon
wrote
immediately
to
omar
and
asked
the
caliph
for
his
commands
concerning
the
disposition
of
the
whole
of
the
precious
contents
of
the
library
the
answer
came
quickly
he
wrote
books
contain
only
what
is
in
the
book
of
god
the
koran
it
is
enough
for
us
and
these
books
are
useless
if
they
contain
anything
contrary
to
the
holy
book
they
are
pernicious

the
koptic
clerical
historians
according
to
their
usual
habit
portray
this
governor
as
still
worse
than
his
predecessors
but
in
this
case
the
mussulman
authorities
are
in
agreement
in
accusing
him
of
the
most
iniquitous
extortions
and
most
barbarous
massacres
the
gravest
reproach
they
bring
against
him
is
that
calling
all
the
monks
together
he
told
them
that
not
only
did
he
intend
to
maintain
the
old
regulations
of
abd
by
which
they
had
to
pay
an
annual
tax
of
one
dinar
but
also
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
receive
yearly
from
his
agents
an
iron
ring
bearing
their
name
and
the
date
of
the
financial
transaction
for
which
ring
they
were
to
make
personal
contribution
he
forced
the
wearing
of
this
ring
continually
and

hand
found
without

strange
form
of
receipt
was

a

them
rebelling
against
the
payment
of
the
tax
retired
into
convents
thinking
they
could
safely
defraud
the
treasury
assama
however
sent
his
soldiers
to
search
these
retreats
and

the
one
that
vexed

which
brought
down
on
him
the
most
violent

was
the
ordinance
by
which
all
ascending

descending

were
obliged
to
provide

exorbitant
claim

abusive
and
arbitrary
sternness

travelling
up

she
wore
such
intolerable
exactions
and
excesses
ended
by
thoroughly
rousing
the
indignant
egyptians
the
malcontents
assembled
and
a
general
revolt
would
have
been
the
result
but
for
the

according
to
the
christian

pursued
the

course
of
intolerance

tyranny
that
he
had
adopted
when
he
governed

enjoined
handhala
to
be

to
treat
the
christians
with
kindness

far
from
conforming
with
these
wise
and

intentions
he
overwhelmed
them
with
vexations

tyrannous
acts

doubled
the
taxes

happened

long
reign

only
events
noticed
by
the
christian
historians
being
those
which
relate
solely
to
their
ecclesiastical
history
the
year
of

saw
the
death
of
alexander
the
koptic
patriarch
of
alexandria
since
the
conquest

by

for
a
period
of
about
years
the
patriarchate
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
jacobites
all
the
bishops
in
egypt
belonged
to
that
sect
and
they
had
established
jacobite
bishops
even
in
nubia
which
they
had
converted
to
their
religion
the
orthodox
christians
elected

as
their
patriarch

that
time
the

had
taken

his
patriarchate
was
a
period
of
peace

quiet
for

temporary
cessation

one
of

first
acts
was
to
take
the
government
of
egypt
from
hafs
in
spite
of
the
kindness
of
his
rule
the
wisdom
and
moderation
of
which
had
gained
for
him
the
affection
of
all
the
provinces
which
he
governed
he
was
replaced
by
isa
ibn
abi
atta
who
soon
created
a
universal
discontent
as
his
administrative
measures
were
oppressive
in
the
year
the
ommayads
were
supplanted
by
the
abbasids
who
transferred
the
capital
from
damascus
to
baghdad
the
first
abbasid
caliph
was
who
claimed
descent
from
abbas
the
uncle
of
muhammed
the
caliph
merwan
the
last
of
the
ommayads
in
his
flight
from
his
enemies
came
to
egypt
and
sent
troops
from
fostât
to
hold
alexandria
he
was
now
pursued
to
his
death
by
the
abbasid
general
salih
ibn
ali

took
possession
of
postât
for
the
new
dynasty
in
the
change
from
the
ommayad
to
the
abbasid
caliphs
was
effected
with
little
difficulty
and
egypt
continued
to
be
a
province
of
the
caliphate
and
was
ruled
by
governors
who
were
mostly
arabs
or
members
of
the
abbasid
family
after
being
inaugurated
began
his
rule
by
recalling
all
the
provincial
governors
whom
he
replaced
by
his
kinsmen
and
partisans
he
entrusted
the
government
of
egypt
to
his
paternal
uncle
salih
ibn
ali
who
had
obtained
the
province
for
him
salih
however
did
not
rule
in
person
but
was
represented
by
abu
aun
abd
ibn
yazid

he
appointed
the
duties
of
patriarch
of
alexandria
were
then
performed
by

commonly
called
khail

the
kopts

patriarch

of
the
jacobite
sect
and
the
successor

very
precise

recording
the
duration

only
secretaries

his
brother
abu
jafar
surnamed
three
years
after
his
accession
he
took
the
government
of
egypt
from
his
uncle
and
in
less
than
seven
years
egypt
passed
successively
through
the
hands
of
six
different
governors
these
changes
were
instigated
by
the
mistrustful
disposition
of
the
caliph
who
saw
in
every
man
a
traitor
and
conspirator
dismissing
on
the
slightest
provocation
his
most
devoted
adherents
some
of
whom
were
even
put
to
death
by
his
orders
his
last
choice

ibn
hatim
governed
egypt
for
eight
years
and
the
caliph
bestowed
the
title
of
prince
of
egypt
emir
misri
upon
him
which
title
was
also
borne
by
his
successors
these
continual
changes
in
the
government
of
egypt
had
not
furthered
the
prosperity
and
of
the
inhabitants
each
ruler
certain
of
speedy
dismissal
busied
himself
with
his
personal
affairs
to
the
detriment
of
the
country
anxious
only
to
amass
by
every
possible
means
sufficient
money
to
compensate
him
for
his
inevitable
deposition
moreover
each
governor
increased
the
taxation
levied
by
his
predecessor
such
was
the
greed
and
rapacity
of
these
governors
that
every
industry
was
continually
subjected
to
increased
taxation
the
working
bricklayer
the
vender
of
vegetables
the
the
gravedigger
all
callings
even
that
of

were
taxed
and
the
lower
classes
were
reduced
to
eating
flesh
and
human
remains
at
the
moment
when

unable
to
support
such
oppression
longer
was

the
verge
of

deeds

fickleness
which
had
signalised
the
caliphate
of
his
father
he
appointed
a
different
governor
of
egypt
nearly
every
year
these
many
changes
resulted
probably
from
the
political
views
held
by
the
caliph
or
perhaps
he
already
perceived
the
tendency
shown
by
each
of
his
provinces
to
separate
itself
from
the
centre
of
islamism
perhaps
also
he
already
foresaw
those
divisions
which
destroyed
the
empire
about
half
a
century
later
thus
his
prudence
sought
in
allowing
but
a
short
period
of
power
to
each
governor
to
prevent
their
strengthening
themselves
sufficiently
in
their
provinces

become

egypt
remained

constant
changes

suit

the
caliph
profited
by
this
peaceful
state
of
things
to
attack
the
emperor
of
the
greeks
his
second
son
harun
undertook
the
continuation
of
this
war
and
the
young
prince
displayed
such
talent
and
bravery
that
he
gained
brilliant
victories
and
returned
to

after
having
captured

harun
seems
to
have
been

reluctant
as
his
father
and
grandfather
were
before
him
to
leave
a
province
too
long
in
the
hands
of
a
governor

he
even
surpassed
them
in
his
precautionary
measures

and
gave
the
government
of
egypt
to

thereafter
the
governors
were
changed
on
an
average
of
once
a
year
and
their
financial

were
separately
administered
musa
ibn

however
held
the
appointment

he
relates
sent
a
beautiful
young
koptic
slave
to
his

the
caliph
as
a
gift
the
egyptian
odalisk
so
charmed
the
caliph
that
he
fell
violently
in
love
with
her
suddenly
however
the
favourite
was
laid
prostrate
by
a
malady
which
the
court
physicians
could
neither
cure
nor
even
diagnose
the
girl
insisted
that
being
egyptian
only
an
egyptian
physician
could
cure
her
the
caliph
instantly
ordered
his
brother
to
send
post

the
most
skilful
doctor
in
egypt
this
proved
to
be
the
melchite
patriarch
for
in

days
koptic
priests
practised
medicine
and
cultivated
other
sciences
the
patriarch
set
out
for
baghdad
restored
the
favourite
to
health
and
in
reward
received
from
the
caliph
an
imperial
diploma
which
restored
to
the
orthodox
christians

melchites
all
those
privileges
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
by
the
jacobite
heretics
since
their
union
with
the
conqueror
amr
ibn
if
this
story
be
true
one
can
not
but
perceive
the
plot
skilfully
laid
and
carried
out
by
the
powerful
clergy
to
whom
any
means
even
the
sending
of
a
concubine
to
the
caliph
seemed
legitimate
to
procure
the
restoration
of
their
supremacy
and
the
humiliation
of
their
adversaries
illustration

the
year
of

the
distance

egypt
from
baghdad
the
capital
was
the
cause
of
the
neglect
of
many
of
his
commands
and
upon
more
than
one
occasion
was
his
authority
slighted
thus
it
happened
that
for
more
than
five
years
the
government
of

was
in

the

he
assumed

of
fever
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
oriental
historians
have
noticed
that
the
numeral
eight
affected
this
caliph
in
a
singular
manner
between
himself
and
abbas
the
head
of
his
house
there
were
eight
generations
he
was
born
in
the
month
of
shaban
the
eighth
month
of
the
mussulman
year
he
was
the
eighth
abbasidian
caliph
and
ascended
the
throne
in
the
year
aged
years
and
eight
months
he
reigned
eight
years
eight
months
and
eight
days
and
died
in
the
year
of
his
age
leaving
eight
sons
and
eight
daughters
he
fought
in
eight
battles
and
on
his
death
eight
million
dinars
and
eighty
thousand
dirhems
were
discovered
in
his
private
treasury
it
is
this
singular
coincidence
which
gave
him
the
name
mutamma
illustration
tomb
of
a
sheikh
but
a
sadder
fatality
exercised
its
influence
over
the
caliph
mutamma
for
from
him
dates
the
beginning
of
the
decadence
of
his
dynasty
and
to
him
its
first
cause
may
be
ascribed
the
fact
is
mutasim
was
uneducated
without
ability
and
lacking
in
moral
principles
he
was
unable
even
to
write
endowed
with
remarkable
strength
and
muscles
of
iron
he
was
able
so
arab
historians
relate
to
lift
and
carry
exceptionally
heavy
weights
to
this
strength
was
added
indomitable
courage
and
love
of
warfare
fine
weapons
horses
and
warriors
this
taste
led
him
even
before
the
death
of
his
father
to
organise
a
picked
corps
for
which
he
selected
the
finest
handsomest
and
strongest
of
the
young
turkish
slaves
taken
in
war
or
sent
as
tribute
to
the
caliph
the
vast
nation
sometimes
called
turks
sometimes
tatars
was
distributed
according
to
all
oriental
geographers
over
all
the
countries
of
northern
asia
from
the
river
jihun
or
oxus
to
kathay
or
china
that
the
turks
and
the
arabs
both
bent
upon
a
persistent
policy
of
conquest
should
come
into
more
or
less
hostile
contact
was
inevitable
the
struggle
was
a
long
one
and
during
the
numerous
engagements
many
prisoners
were
taken
on
both
sides
those
turks
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
arabs
were
sent
to
the
different
provinces
of
their
domain
where
they
became
slaves
of
the
chief
emirs
and
of
the
caliphs
themselves
where
finding
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
caliphs
they
were
soon
transferred
to
their
personal
retinue
the
distrust
which
the
caliphs
felt
for
the
emirs
of
their
court
whose
claims
they
were
only
able
to
appease
by
making
vassals
of
them
caused
them
to
commit
the
grave
error
of
confiding
in
these
alien
slaves
who
barbaric
and
illiterate
as
they
were
now
living
in
the
midst
of
princes
soon
acquired
a
knowledge
of
muhammedanism
the
sciences
and
above
all
the
politics
of
the
country
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
able
to
fill
the
most
responsible
positions
and
given
their
freedom
by
the
caliphs
were
employed
by
the
government
according
to
their
abilities
not
only
were
they
given
the
chief
positions
at
court
but
the
government
of
the
principal
provinces
was
entrusted
to
them
they
repaid
these
favours
later
by
the
blackest
ingratitude
especially
when
the
formation
of
a
turkish
guard
brought
a
number
of
their
own
countrymen
under
their
influence
ever
anxious
to
augment
his
own
and
finding
the
number
of
turks
he
annually
received
as
tribute
insufficient
purchased
a
great
many
for
the
purpose
of
training
them
for
that
particular
service
but
these
youths
speedily
abused
the
confidence
shown
them
by
the
caliph
who
perceiving
that
their
insolence
was
daily
growing
more
insupportable
to
the
inhabitants
of
baghdad
resolved
to
leave
the
capital
rebuild
the
ancient
city
of
samarrah
and
again
make
it
the
seat
of
the
empire
at
this
time
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
one
tulun
a
freedman
whom
fate
would
seem
to
have
reduced
to
servitude
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
a
slave
might
found
a
dynasty
destined
to
rule
over
egypt

confidence
that

continually
keeping

at

became
the
father
of
several
children

of
kassimeh
the
slave

suyuti
adds
that
tulun
adopted
the
child
on

of
his
good
qualities

this
statement
is
unsupported

contradicted

a
few

two
years
afterwards

as
his

the
most
important
event
in

reign

was
the
falling

this
disaster

the

earthquake

considerable
violence
which
was

had
married
the
influential
general

when
the

was
given
the
rulership
of

year
he
sent
his
stepson
as
proxy
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
on

ramadhan
september
ahmed
ibn

arrived
at

encountered
great
difficulties
and
discovered
that
at

districts

were
independent

were
not
directly
under

arrival

himself
born
to
the
place
he
crushed
the
uprising
and
also
suppressed
a
second
revolt
that
was
threatening
by
degrees
he
cleverly
undermined
the
power
of
his

made
his

secure

of

obtain

he
kept
the
regent
in

in
a
state
of
complacency
occasionally
sending
him
tribute
but
as
wars
with
the
sinds
began
to
trouble
the
caliphate
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
trouble
himself
further
about
baghdad

decided
to
keep
his
money
for
himself
muaffik
was
not
the
man
to
stand
this

disastrous
results

not

money
to
pay

troops

undertaking

enormous
produce

compulsory
labour

the
industrious
kopt

in
a
yearly
income

these
people
felt
themselves
better
off
than
formerly
on
account
of
the
greater
order
and
peace
that
existed
under
his
energetic
government
it
can
not
be
denied
that
ahmed
in
the
course
of
years
became
much
more
extravagant
and
luxurious
but
he
used
his
large
means
in
some
measure
for
the
betterment
of
the
country
he
gave
large
sums
not
only
for
the
erection

khumarawaih
who
inherited
the

had
not
many
of
his
characteristics
he
was
a
young
man
barely
twenty
years
old
and
with
a
marked
distaste
for
war
he
did
however
notwithstanding
his
proclivities
fight
the
forces
near
damascus
and
defeat
them
never
having
seen
a
battle
before
the
emir
fled
from
the
scene
in
a
panic
when

became

he

put
to

when

boy
seemed
incapable

anything

stupid

put

the
commander
of
the

declared
himself
on
the
side
of
the
caliph
and
the
syrian
emirs
gave
themselves
up
to
his
general
muhammed
ibn
suleiman
without
any
resistance
at
the
close
of
the
year
he
was
before
fostât
and
at
the
same
time
a
fleet
appeared
at
damietta
a
quarrel
arose
amongst
in
which
the
unlucky
prince
was
killed
his
uncle
shaiban
a
worthy
son
of
ahmed
made
a
last
stand
but
was
obliged
to
give
in
to
the
superior
force
muhammed
behaved
with
his
turks
in
the
most
outrageous
way
in
fostât
the
plundering
was
unrestrained
and
that
part
of
fostât
which
ahmed
had
built
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
the
adherents
of
the
reigning
family
were
grossly
maltreated
many
of
them
killed
and
others
sent
to
baghdad
the
governors
changed
in
rapid
succession
disorder
want
and
wretchedness
existed
throughout
the
entire
country
west
of
the
kingdom
at
this
period
the
provinces
of
the
empire
had
already
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
numerous
minor
princes
who
presuming
on
the
weakness
had
declared
themselves
independent
sovereigns
nothing
remained
to
the
abbasids
but
baghdad
a
few
neighbouring
provinces
and
egypt
under
the
caliphs
muktadir
kahir
and

had
an
almost
constant
change
of
governors
one
of
them
abu
bekr
muhammed
ultimately
became
the
founder
of
a
new
dynasty
the
ikshidite
destined
to
rule
over
egypt
and
syria
abu
bekr
muhammed
was
the
son
of
takadj
then
governor
of
damascus
his
father
had
been
chief
emir
at
the
court
of
the
tulunid
princes
and
after
the
fall
of
this
dynasty
remained
in
egypt
where
he
occupied
a
post
under
the
government
intrigues
however
drove
him
to
syria
whither
his
partisans
followed
him
he
first
entered
the
army
of
the
caliph
and
capturing
the
town
of
ramleh
was
given
the
governorship
of
damascus
as
reward
his
son
abu
bekr
muhammed
did
not
go
to
egypt
to
fulfil
the
duties
with
which
he
had
been
invested
and
only
retained
the
title
for
one
month
he
was
subsequently
reinstated
and
this
time
repaired
thither
but
ahmed
ibn
kighlagh
who
was
then
governing
egypt
refused
to
retire
and
was
only
defeated
after
several
engagements
when
he
and
his
followers
proceeded
to
barca
in
africa
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
the
caliph
radhi
bestowed
the
honour
of
emir
prince
of
princes
upon
muhammed
ibn
raik
this
officer
discontented
with
the
government
of
palestine
led
an
army
into
syria
and
expelled
badra
the
lieutenant
of
muhammed
the
latter
left
egypt
at
once
entrusting
the
government
of
that
country
to
his
brother
and
brought
his
forces
to
faramah
where
the
troops
of
muhammed
ibn
raik
were
already
stationed
thanks
to
the
mediation
of
several
emirs
matters
were
concluded
peacefully
and
muhammed
returned
to
fostât
upon
his
arrival
however
he
learnt
that
muhammed
ibn
raik
had
again
left
damascus
and
was
preparing
to
march
upon
egypt
this
intelligence
obliged
muhammed
to
return
at
once
to
syria
he
encountered
the
of
the
enemy
and
promptly
led
the
attack
his
right
wing
was
scattered
but
the
centre
commanded
by
himself
remained
firm
and
muhammed
ibn
raik
retreated
towards
damascus
husain
brother
of
lost
his
life
in
the
combat
despite
the
enmity
between
them
muhammed
ibn
raik
sent
his
own
son
to
charged
with
messages
of
condolence
for
the
loss
he
had
sustained
and
bearing
proposals
of
peace
muhammed
received
the
son
of
his
enemy
with
much
respect
and
invested
him
with
a
mantle
of
honour
he
then
consented
to
cede
damascus
in
consideration
of
an
annual
tribute
of
pieces
of
gold
and
the
restoration
of
all
that
portion
of
palestine
between
ramleh
and
the
frontiers
of
egypt
after
having
concluded
all
the
arrangements
relative
to
this
treaty

returned
to

year
of

in

he
was

years
of
age
and
had
reigned
six
years
ten
months
and
ten
days
his
brother
abu
ishak
ibrahim
succeeded
him
and
was
henceforth
known
by
the
name
of
muttaki
a
year
later
muhammed
was
acknowledged
prince
of
egypt
by
the
new
caliph
shortly
after
he
learnt
that
his
former
enemy
muhammed
ibn
raik
had
been
killed
by
the
hamdanites
he
thereupon
seized
the
opportunity
to
recover
those
provinces
he
had
granted
him
and
marching
into
syria
captured
damascus
and
all
the
possessions
he
had
relinquished
upon
the
conclusion
of
their
treaty
feeling
now
that
his
position
was
secure
he
caused
his
son
kasim
to
be
recognised
by
the
emirs
and
the
entire
army
as
his
successor
the
year
of
the
hegira
was
a
disastrous
one
in
baghdad
the
office
of
prince
of
princes
bestowed
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
turkish
officers
upon
any
of
their
leaders
was
now
become
a
position
superior
even
to
that
of
caliph
it
was
held
at
this
time
by
a
turk
named
turun
who
so
oppressed
the
caliph
muttaki
that
the
latter
was
forced
to
fly
from
his
capital
and
retire
to
mosul
he
then
besought
help
from
the
hamdanites
who
immediately
rallied
their
forces
and
accompanied
by
the
caliph
marched
upon
baghdad
they
were
however
completely
routed
by
turun
and
obliged
v
to
retreat
muttaki
showed
his
gratitude
to
the
two
princes
by
conferring
a
mantle
of
honour
upon
them
which
for
some
time
past
had
been
the
only
gift
that
islam
sovereigns
had
been
able
to
bestow
leaving
mosul
the
caliph
proceeded
to
rakkah
and
there
was
invited
by
turun
to
return
to
baghdad
seeing
that
his
adherents
the
hamdanites
were
greatly
discouraged
by
their
recent
reverses
muttaki
resolved
to
accept
the
offer
when
muhammed
heard
this
he
hastened
to
rakkah
and
offered
the
caliph
refuge
in
egypt
but
the
caliph
refused
agreeing
however
as
muhammed
promised
to
supply
him
with
the
necessary
funds
not
to
return
to
baghdad
and
place
himself
in
the
power
of
turun
in
spite
of
his
promise
when
turun
fearing
that
the
caliph
had
found
powerful
friends
came
to
him
and
casting
himself
before
muttaki
paid
him
all
the
homage
due
to
an
islam
sovereign
he
allowed
himself
to
be
overruled
and
accompanied
turun
back
to
baghdad
hardly
had
the
unfortunate
caliph
set
foot
in
his
capital
when
he
was
murdered
after
reigning
four
years
and
eleven
months
turun
now
proclaimed
abd
allah
kasim
son
of
muttaki
caliph
who
after
a
short
and
uneventful
reign
was
succeeded
by
his
uncle
kasim
who
was
the
last
of
the
abbasid
caliphs
whom
egypt
acknowledged
as
suzerains
after
return
to
baghdad
muhammed
remained
for
some
time
in
damascus
and
then
set
out
for
egypt
his
return
was
signalised
by
the
war
with
saif
prince
of
hamdan
the
campaign
was
of
varying
success
after
a
disastrous
battle
in
which
the
egyptians
lost
four
thousand
men
as
prisoners
muhammed
left
egypt
with
a
numerous
army
and
arrived
at
maarrah
saif
determined
to
decide
the
war
with
one
desperate
effort
and
first
secured
the
safety
of
his
treasure
his
baggage
and
his
harem
by
sending
them
to
mesopotamia
then
he
marched
upon
who
had
taken
his
position
at
kinesrin
muhammed
divided
his
forces
into
two
corps
placing
in
the
vanguard
all
those
who
carried
lances
he
himself
was
in
the
rear
with
ten
thousand
picked
men
saif
charged
the
vanguard
and
routed
it
but
the
rear
stood
firm
this
resistance
saved
from
total
defeat
the
two
armies
separated
after
a
somewhat
indecisive
engagement
and
saif
who
could
claim
no
advantage
save
the
capture
of
his
baggage
went
on
to
maubej
where
he
destroyed
the
bridge
and
entering
mesopotamia
proceeded
towards
rakkah
but
muhammed
was
already
stationed
there
and
the
hostile
armies
separated
only
by
the
euphrates
faced
one
another
for
several
days
negotiations
were
then
opened
and
peace
was
concluded
the
conditions
were
that
hemessa
aleppo
and
mesopotamia
should
belong
to
saif
and
all
the
country
from
hemessa
to
the
frontiers
of
egypt
remain
in
the
possession
of
muhammed
a
trench
was
dug
between
djouchna
and
lebouah
in
those
places
where
there
were
no
natural
boundaries
to
mark
the
separation
of
the
two
states
to
ratify
this
solemn
peace
saif
married
the
daughter
of
muhammed
then
each
prince
returned
to
his
own
province
the
treaty
was
however
almost
immediately
set
aside
by
the
hamdanites
and
forced
to
retrace
his
steps
defeated
them
in
several
engagements
and
seized
the
town
of
aleppo
thus
we
see
that
the
year
of
the
hegira
was
full
of
important
events
to
which
was
soon
added
the
death
of
muhammed
he
died
at
damascus
in
the
last
month
of
the
year
aged
sixty
and
had
reigned
eleven
years
three
months
and
two
days
he
was
buried
at
jerusalem
muhammed
was
a
man
possessing
many
excellent
talents
and
chiefly
renowned
as
an
admirable
soldier
brave
without
being
rash
quick
to
calculate
his
chances
he
was
able
always
to
seize
the
advantage
on
the
other
hand
however
he
was
so
distrustful
and
timid
in
the
privacy
of
his
palace
that
he
organised
a
guard
of
eight
thousand
armed
slaves
one
thousand
of
whom
kept
constant
watch
he
never
spent
the
entire
night
in
the
same
apartment
or
tent
and
no
one
was
ever
permitted
to
know
the
place
where
he
slept
we
are
told
that
this
prince
could
muster
four
hundred
thousand
men
although
historians
do
not
definitely
specify
the
boundaries
of
his
empire
which
of
course
varied
from
time
to
time
we
may
nevertheless
believe
that
his
kingdom
as
that
of
his
predecessors
the
tulunites
extended
over
egypt
palestine
syria
and
mesopotamia
as
far
as
the
euphrates
and
even
included
a
large
portion
of
arabia
the
christians
of
the
east
charge
him
with
supporting
his
immense
army
at
their
expense
and
persecuting
and
taxing
them
to
such
an
extent
that
they
were
forced
to
sell
many
possessions
belonging
to
their
church
before
they
could
pay
the
required
sums
but
if
we
may
credit
a
contemporary
historian
more
worthy
of
belief
these
expenses
were
covered
by
the
treasure
muhammed
himself
discovered
in
fact
who
died
at
cairo
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
relates
that
knowing
much
treasure
to
be
buried
there
was
greatly
interested
in
the
excavation
of
the
subterraneous
tombs
of
the
ancient
egyptian
kings
he
adds
fortunate
enough
to
come
across
a
portion
of
those
tombs
consisting
of
vast
rooms
magnificently
decorated
there
he
found
marvellously
wrought
figures
of
old
and
young
men
women
and
children
having
eyes
of
precious
stones
and
faces
of
gold
and
muhammed
was
succeeded
by
his
son
kasim
muhammed
surnamed
ungur
the
prince
being
only
an
infant
kafur
the
favourite
minister
of
the
late
caliph
was
appointed
regent
this
kafur
was
a
black
slave
purchased
by
for
the
trifling
sum
of
twenty
pieces
of
gold
he
was
intelligent
zealous
and
faithful
and
soon
won
the
confidence
of
his
master
nobility
of
race
in
the
east
appertains
only
to
the
descendants
of
the
prophet
but
merit
which
may
be
found
in
prince
and
subject
alike
often
secures
the
highest
positions
and
even
the
throne
itself
for
those
of
the
humblest
origin
such
was
the
fate
of
kafur
he
showed
taste
for
the
sciences
and
encouraged
scholars
he
loaded
the
poets
with
benefits
and
they
sang
his
praises
without
measure
so
long
as
he
continued
his
favours
but
satirised
him
with
equal
vigour
as
soon
as
his
munificence
diminished
invested
with
supreme
authority
kafur
served
the
young
prince
with
a
devotion
and
fidelity
worthy
of
the
highest
praise
his
first
step
was
to
dismiss
abu
bekr
muhammed
the
receiver
of
the
egyptian
tributes
against
whom
he
had
received
complaints
in
his
place
he
appointed
a
native
of
mardin
also
called
muhammed
of
whose
honesty
and
kindliness
he
was
well
aware
he
then
took
his
pupil
to
egypt
which
country
they
reached
in
the
month
of
safar
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
saif
hearing
of
the
death
of
muhammed
and
the
departure
of
ungur
deemed
this
a
favourable
opportunity
to
despoil
his
he
therefore
marched
upon
damascus
which
he
captured
but
the
faithful
kafur
promptly
arrived
upon
the
scene
with
a
powerful
army
and
routing
saif
who
had
advanced
as
far
as
ramleh
drove
him
back
to
rakkah
and
relieved
damascus
the
remainder
of
the
reign
of
ungur
passed
peacefully

to
the
watchfulness
and
wise
government
of
kafur

the
year
of
the
hegira
the
king
of
nubia
invaded
the
egyptian
territories
advancing
to
syene
which
he
pillaged
and
laid
waste
kafur
at
once
despatched
his
forces
overland
and
along
the
nile
and
simultaneously
ordered
a
detachment
embarking
from
the
red
sea
to
proceed
along
the
southern
coast
attack
the
enemy
in
the
rear
and
completely
cut
off
their
retreat
the
nubians
thus
surprised
on
all
sides
were
defeated
and
forced
to
retreat
leaving
the
fortress
of
rym
now
known
as
ibrim
and
situated
fifty
miles
from
syênê
in
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
no
other
events

note
took
place
during
the
lifetime
of

reigned
fourteen
years

lasted
two
years
and
four
months
the
greater
portion
of
said
was
seized
by
the
fatimites
already
masters
of
fayum
and
alexandria
and
the
conquerors
were
on
the
point
of
encroaching
still
farther
when
kafur
died
in
the
year
ahmed
surnamed
fawaris
the
son
of
ali
and
consequently
grandson
of
succeeded
kafur
the
prince
was
only
eleven
years
old
and
therefore
incapable
of
properly
controlling
egypt
syria
and
his
other
domains
husain
one
of
his
relatives
invaded
syria
but
in
his
turn
driven
back
by
the
karmates
returned
to
egypt
and
strove
to
depose
ahmed
these
divisions
in
the
reigning
family
severed
the
ties
which
united
the
provinces
of
the
egyptian
kingdom
to
terminate
the
disturbances
the
emirs
resolved
to
seek
the
protection
of
the
fatimites
the
latter
anxious
to
secure
the
prize
gladly
rendered
assistance
and
husain
was
forced
to
return
to
syria
where
he
took
possession
of
damascus
and
the
unfortunate
ahmed
lost
the
throne
of
egypt
with
him
perished
the
ikshid
dynasty
which
more
ephemeral
even
than
that
of
the
tulunid
flourished
only
years
and
days
the
period
upon
which
this
history
is
now
about
to
enter
is
of
more
than
usual
interest
for
it
leads
immediately
to
the
centuries
during
which
the
arabic
forces
came
into
contact
with
the
forces
of
western
europe
the
town
and
the
coast
of
mauritania
were
then
ruled
by
the
fatimites
a
dynasty
independent
of
the
abbasid
caliphs
of
baghdad
the
fatimites
belonged
to
the
tribes
of
koramah
who
dwelt
in
the
mountains
situated
near
the
town
of
fez
in
the
extreme
west
of
africa
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
they
began
to
extend
their
sway
in
the
western
regions
of
africa
pursuing
their
conquests
farther
east
the
fatimite
caliph
obaid
allah
and
his
son
kasim
cherished
designs
not
only
upon
egypt
but
even
aimed
at
the
destruction
of
the
abbasid
caliphate
these
plans
being
so
far
successful
as
to
leave
the
fatimites
in
secure
possession
of
alexandria
and
more
or
less
in
power
in
fayum
the
fatimite
caliphs
had
lofty
and
pretentious
claims
to
the
allegiance
of
the
moslem
world
they
traced
their
descent
from
fatima
a
daughter
of
the
prophet
whom
muhammed
himself
regarded
as
one
of
the
four
perfect
women
at
the
age
of
fifteen
she
married
ali
of
whom
she
was
the
only
wife
and
the
partisans
of
ali
as
we
have
seen
disputed
with
omar
the
right
to
the
leadership
of
islam
upon
the
death
critics
are
not
wanting
who
dispute
the
family
origin
of
obaid
allah
but
his
claim
appears
to
have
been
unhesitatingly
admitted
by
his
own
immediate
followers
the
fatimite
successes
in
the
mediterranean
gave
them
a
substantial
basis
of
political
power
and
doubtless
this
outward
and
material
success
was
more
important
to
them
than
their
claim
to
both
a
physical
and
mythical
descent
from
the
founder
of
their
religion
some
accounts
trace
the
descent
of
obaid
from
abd
allah
ibn
maimun
the
founder
of
the
ismailian
sect
of
which
the
carmathians
were
a
branch
the
ismailians
may
be
best
regarded
as
one
of
the
several
sects
of
shiites
who
originally
were
simply
the
partisans
of
ali
against
omar
but
by
degrees
they
became
identified
as
the
upholders
of
the
koran
against
the
validity
of
the
oral
tradition
and
when
later
the
whole
of
persia
espoused
the
cause
of
ali
the
shiite
belief
became
tinged
with
all
kinds
of
mysticism
the
ismailians
believed
for
instance
in
the
coming
of
a
messiah
to
whom
they
gave
the
name
mahdi
and
who
would
one
day
appear
on
earth
to
establish
the
reign
of
justice
and
revenge
the
wrongs
done
to
the
family
of
ali
the
ismailians
regarded
obaid
himself
as
the
mahdi
and
they
also
believed
in
incarnations
of
the
soul
which
in
former
ages
had
appeared
as
the
hebrew
prophets
but
which
to
the
muhammedan
manifested
itself
as
imans
the
iman
is
properly
the
leader
of
public
worship
but
it
is
not
so
much
an
office
as
a
seership
with
mystical
attributes
the
muhammedan
imans
so
far
have
numbered
eleven
the
twelfth
and
greatest
being
yet
to
come
the
ismailians
also
introduced
mysticism
into
the
interpretation
of
the
koran
and
even
taught
that
its
moral
precepts
were
not
to
be
taken
in
a
literal
sense
thus
the
fatimite
caliphs
founded
their
authority
upon
a
combination
of
political
power
and
superstition
kasim
who
ruled
at
alexandria
was
succeeded
in
by
his
son
under
his
reign
the
fatimites
were
attacked
by
abu
yazid
a
berber
who
gathered
around
him
the
sunnites
and
the
revolutionaries
succeeded
in
taking
the
fatimite
capital
kairwan
however
soon
defeated
abu
yazid
in
a
decisive
battle
and
rebuilt
a
new
city
mansuria
on
the
site
of
the
modern
cairo
to
commemorate
the
event
dying
in
he
was
succeeded
by
muiz
muiz
came
to
the
throne
just
at
the
time
when
dissensions
as
to
the
succession
were
undermining
the
ikshid
dynasty
seizing
the
opportunity
in
the
year
muiz
equipped
a
large
and
force
with
a
formidable
body
of
cavalry
the
whole
under
the
command
of
gohar
a
native
of
greece
and
a
slave
of
his
father
this
general
on
his
arrival
near
alexandria
received
a
deputation
from
the
inhabitants
of
fostât
charged
to
negotiate
a
treaty
their
overtures
were
favourably
entertained
and
the
conquest
of
the
country
seemed
probable
without
bloodshed
but
while
the
conditions
were
being
ratified
the
ikshidites
prevailed
on
the
people
to
revoke
their
offer
and
the
ambassadors
on
their
return
were
themselves
compelled
to
seek
safety
in
flight
gohar
incurred
no
delay
in
pushing
his
troops
forward
he
forced
the
passage
of
the
nile
a
few
miles
south
of
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
the
ikshidites
suffered
a
disastrous
defeat
to
the
honour
of
the
african
general
it
is
related
that
the
inhabitants
of
fostât
were
pardoned
and
the
city
was
peaceably
occupied
the
submission
of
the
rest
of
egypt
to
muiz
was
secured
by
this
victory
in
the
year
syria
was
also
added
to
his
domains
but
shortly
after
was
overrun
by
the
carmathians
the
troops
of
muiz
met
with
several
reverses
damascus
was
taken
and
those
lawless
freebooters
joined
by
the
ikshidites
advanced
to
ain
shems
in
the
meanwhile
gohar
had
fortified
cairo
the
new
capital
which
he
had
founded
immediately
north
of
fostât
and
taken
every
precaution
to
repel
the
invaders
a
bloody
battle
was
fought
in
the
year
before
the
city
walls
without
any
decisive
result
later
however
gohar
obtained
a
victory
over
the
enemy
which
proved
to
be
a
decisive
one
muiz
subsequently
removed
his
court
to
his
new
kingdom
in
ramadhan
he
entered
cairo
bringing
with
him
the
bodies
of
his
three
predecessors
and
vast
treasure
muiz
reigned
about
two
years
in
egypt
dying
in
the
year
he
is
described
as
a
warlike
and
ambitious
prince
but
notwithstanding
he
was
especially
distinguished
for
justice
and
was
fond
of
learning
he
showed
great
favour
to
the
christians
especially
to
severus
bishop
of
and
the
patriarch
ephrem
and
under
his
orders
and
with
his
assistance
the
church
of
the
in
old
misr
was
rebuilt
he
executed
many
useful
works
among
others
rendering
navigable
the
tanitic
branch
of
the
nile
which
is
still
called
the
canal
of
muiz
and
occupied
himself
in
embellishing
cairo
gohar
when
he
founded
that
city
built
the
great
mosque
named
the
university
of
egypt
which
to
this
day
is
crowded
with
students
from
all
parts
of
the
moslem
world
aziz
nizar
on
coming
to
the
throne
of
his
father
immediately
despatched
an
expedition
against
the
turkish
chief
who
had
taken
damascus
a
short
time
previously
gohar
again
commanded
the
army
and
pressed
the
siege
of
that
city
so
vigorously
that
the
enemy
called
to
their
aid
the
carmathians
before
this
united
army
he
was
forced
to
retire
slowly
to
ascalon
where
he
prepared
to
stand
a
siege
but
being
reduced
to
great
straits
he
purchased
his
liberty
with
a
large
sum
of
money
on
his
return
from
this
disastrous
campaign
aziz
took
command
in
person
and
meeting
the
enemy
at
ramleh
was
victorious
after
a
bloody
battle
while
being
betrayed
into
his
hands
was
with
arab
magnanimity
received
with
honour
and
confidence
and
ended
his
days
in
egypt
in
affluence
aziz
followed
his
example
of
liberality
it
is
even
said
that
he
appointed
a
jew
his
vizier
in
syria
and
a
christian
to
the
same
post
in
egypt
these
acts
however
nearly
cost
him
his
life
and
a
popular
tumult
obliged
him
to
disgrace
both
these
officers
after
a
reign
of
years
of
great
internal
prosperity
he
died
in
a
bath
at
bilbeis
while
preparing
an
expedition
against
the
greeks
who
were
ravaging
his
possessions
in
syria
aziz
was
distinguished
for
moderation
and
mildness
but
his
son
and
successor
rendered
himself
notorious
for
very
opposite
qualities
hakim
abu
ali
mansur
commenced
his
reign
according
to
moslem
historians
with
much
wisdom
but
afterwards
acquired
a
reputation
for
impiety
cruelty
and
unreasoning
extravagance
by
which
he
has
been
rendered
odious
to
posterity
he
is
said
to
have
had
at
the
same
time
and
boldness
cowardice
and
timorousness
a
love
for
learning
and
vindictiveness
towards
the
learned

inclination
to
righteousness
and
a
disposition
to
slay

also
arrogated
to
himself
divinity
and
commanded
his
subjects
to
rise
at
the
mention
of
his
name
in
the
congregational
prayers
an
edict
which
was
obeyed
even
in
the
holy
cities
mecca
and
medina
he
is
most
famous
in
connection
with
the
druses
a
sect
which
he
founded
and
which
still
holds
him
in
veneration
and
believes
in
his
future
return
to
the
earth

had
made
himself
obnoxious
to
all
classes
of
his
