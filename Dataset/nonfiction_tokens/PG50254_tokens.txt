introduction
in
submitting
to
the
public
the
following
interesting
cases
illustrative
of
the
effects
of
my
mode
of
treating
diseases
of
the
eye
i
have
prefixed
to
them
the
original
communications
transmitted
by
me
to
the
and
the
my
reason
for
so
doing
is
this
i
wish
it
to
be
seen
by
actual
comparison
that
in
every
instance
the
confidence
i
have
expressed
in
the
efficacy
of
these
medicines
has
not
been
overrated
on
the
contrary
it
will
be
seen
that
i
have
said
less
than
the
facts
really
warrant
it
will
also
be
found
that
the
cases
which
have
come
under
my
treatment
are
without
exception
such
as
have
been
regarded
either
as
hopeless
or
at
least
such
as
have
previously
enjoyed
without
sensible
benefit
all
the
advantages
of
our
best
ophthalmic
institutions
it
can
not
therefore
be
contended
that
the
ordinary
treatment
would
have
proved
equally
efficacious
if
it
had
been
previously
tried
i
have
also
given
the
cases
that
are
at
present
under
my
treatment
in
order
that
all
who
take
an
interest
in
the
subject
may
have
ample
opportunity
of
watching
their
progress
and
forming
from
their
own
observations
just
conclusions
i
have
also
added
some
important
observations
concerning
the
action
of
the
essential
oils
on
the
eye
as
exhibited
both
externally
and
internally
action
of
hydrocyanic
acid
upon
the
eye
in
september
i
made
the
following
communication
to
the
editor
of
the
which
he
kindly
inserted
it
is
a
fact
that
the
eyes
of
those
who
have
been
destroyed
by
hydrocyanic
acid
show
none
of
the
usual
symptoms
of
dimness
for
a
length
of
time
after
death
on
the
contrary
the
eye
is
clear
and
the
pupil
much
dilated
this
satisfied
me
that
the
acid
exerted
a
specific
action
upon
the
eye
which
might
be
made
available
as
a
medical
agent
for
relieving
many
of
the
diseases
to
which
that
organ
is
so
subject
morbid
appearances
produced
by
hydrocyanic
acid
in
a
case
related
by
hufeland
the
inspection
was
made
the
day
after
death
the
eyes
were
still
glistening
like
those
of
a
person
alive
but
the
countenance
was
pale
and
composed
like
one
asleep
the
arteries
and
left
cavities
of
the
heart
were
empty
and
the
veins
and
right
cavities
on
poisons
page
in
most
instances
venous
turgescence
and
emptiness
of
the
arterial
system
is
commonly
remarked
throughout
the
whole
on
poisons
page
it
appears
that
long
after
death
the
eye
as
in
hufeland
case
has
a
peculiar
glistening
and
staring
expression
so
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
individual
is
really
dead
and
this
appearance
has
been
considered
by
paris
so
remarkable
as
even
alone
to
supply
decisive
evidence
of
poisoning
by
hydrocyanic
on
poisons
page
numerous
reports
have
now
been
made
of
those
who
have
died
in
consequence
of
this
poison
and
the
most
striking
effects
to
be
observed
are
the
extraordinary
state
of
the
eye
which
has
indeed
been
considered
as
the
most
characteristic
phenomenon
and
at
once
to
point
out
the
cause
of
death
the
shining
glistening
sparkling
lustre
of
the
eye
has
been
on
most
occasions
observed
no
one
has
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
learn
attempted
to
explain
this
most
striking
appearance
it
has
however
been
said
that
those
who
die
from
the
effects
of
charcoal
often
exhibit
the
same
unearthly
sigmond
on
poisoning
with
prussic
the
lancet
august
page
my
first
experiment
was
undertaken
in
with
the
diluted
acid
by
dipping
a
sponge
into
it
and
rubbing
it
upon
the
forehead
for
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
which
gave
the
skin
a
very
red
appearance
but
the
patient
experienced
not
the
least
sense
of
heat
and
the
pupil
was
slightly
dilated
i
continued
to
use
this
with
very
beneficial
effects
in
incipient
cataract
opacities
of
the
cornea
inflammation
amaurosis
iritis
of
late
instead
of
the
diluted
acid
i
have
applied
the
of
the
concentrated
acid
to
the
eye
with
much
more
decided
effect
and
without
the
slightest
danger
the
plan
i
generally
adopt
is
to
put
into
an
a
drachm
of
the
acid
and
hold
it
in
close
contact
with
the
eye
the
eyelid
being
open
for
the
space
of
about
half
a
minute
or
until
such
time
as
the
patient
feels
a
little
warmth
or
the
person
holding
the
phial
sees
the
pupil
greatly
dilated
and
the
vessels
of
the
eye
injected
with
blood
which
is
the
invariable
effect
of
the
application
of
the
acid
the
patient
is
not
sensible
of
pain
from
this
peculiar
state
being
induced
which
appears
to
me
to
result
from
the
powerfully
sedative
influence
of
the
acid
thereby
showing
that
two
opposite
powers
to
wit
the
stimulating
and
the
sedative
are
exerted
at
the
same
time
and
thereby
the
uneasiness
arising
generally
from
a
stimulant
alone
is
prevented
its
great
power
in
removing
these
diseases
chiefly
arises
from
the
two
powers
being
so
blended
and
thus
enabling
the
eye
to
bear
a
sufficient
stimulating
action
without
injury
the
person
who
holds
the
acid
to
the
eye
should
careful
not
to
allow
the
patient
to
smell
page
in
whatever
manner
it
is
prescribed
or
administered
either
therapeutically
or
as
a
poison
hydrocyanic
acid
operates
directly
on
the
nervous
the
and
the
gave
insertion
to
the
following
statement
of
mine
of
date
sir
in
october
i
gave
an
account
of
the
action
of
the
vapour
of
upon
diseases
of
the
eye
since
that
period
i
have
been
engaged
in
investigating
the
action
of
various
other
bodies
on
the
same
organ
and
under
the
same
form
one
reason
why
i
did
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
effects
produced
by
the
hydrocyanic
acid
was
that
its
action
like
that
of
all
other
medicines
decreased
in
power
by
continued
application
thereby
rendering
it
necessary
to
have
occasional
recourse
to
other
medicines
in
order
to
insure
a
more
speedy
recovery
another
reason
was
the
reluctance
of
many
individuals
to
submit
the
eye
to
the
action
of
so
potent
a
medicine
the
first
medicines
to
which
i
shall
refer
and
which
i
have
employed
with
some
success
are
the
and
chyazic
the
plan
i
pursue
is
that
of
putting
a
drachm
of
one
of
the
medicines
into
a
bottle
containing
a
small
piece
of
sponge
of
about
size
having
a
mouth
precisely
fitted
to
the
eye
and
with
a
stopper
the
action
of
these
medicines
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
in
as
far
as
they
both
stimulate
the
eye
and
produce
much
greater
warmth
and
irritation
with
less
dilatation
of
the
pupil
few
however
can
bear
the
to
be
applied
longer
to
the
eye
than
half
a
minute
though
in
a
minute
after
its
application
all
irritation
is
removed
and
the
eye
feels
perfectly
at
ease
the
next
medicine
which
i
have
employed
in
the
form
of
vapour
was
the
chloruret
of
iodine
this
medicine
produces
very
little
warmth
or
uneasiness
to
the
eye
if
continued
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
or
upwards
but
a
sensation
of
irritation
accompanied
with
a
flow
of
tears
takes
place
on
its
removal
it
contracts
the
pupil
and
in
no
case
have
i
seen
it
dilate
it
its
vapour
rises
very
readily
and
does
not
leave
the
yellow
disagreeable
colouring
on
the
skin
produced
by
the
vapour
of
iodine
when
uncombined
which
is
a
great
drawback
in
the
use
of
iodine
in
diseases
of
the
eye
the
last
medicine
which
i
have
employed
is
the
bisulphuret
of
carbon
which
is
so
volatile
that
the
application
of
it
to
the
eye
when
the
bottle
is
held
in
a
warm
hand
for
a
few
seconds
is
as
much
as
can
be
borne
in
consequence
of
the
intense
prickling
heat
and
flow
of
tears
which
it
occasions
owing
to
this
fact
i
generally
use
it
by
causing
the
patient
to
shut
the
eyelid
during
its
application
which
can
then
be
continued
for
a
minute
or
two
with
the
same
beneficial
effect
upon
the
eye
without
inconvenience
to
the
patient
it
generally
contracts
the
pupil
and
very
seldom
dilates
it
i
used
to
employ
iodine
by
putting
it
into
the
same
bottles
and
immersing
it
in
hot
water
and
in
its
state
of
vapour
applying
it
to
the
eye
but
i
find
it
answers
much
better
when
dissolved
in
the
bisulphuret
of
carbon
it
is
my
intention
shortly
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
action
of
these
medicines
upon
the
various
forms
of
disease
to
which
the
eye
is
subject
and
also
what
particular
disease
each
medicine
is
best
calculated
to
remove
at
the
same
time
i
shall
state
such
instances
of
failure
as
have
occurred
in
my
experience
in
order
that
a
just
estimate
may
be
formed
of
the
value
and
importance
of
each
medicine
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
state
that
i
have
employed
with
great
success
the
bisulphuret
of
carbon
to
enlarged
indurated
lymphatic
glands
in
the
first
instance
i
rubbed
equal
quantities
of
the
bisulphuret
of
carbon
and
alcohol
upon
the
parts
affected
but
without
any
effect
upon
the
glands
but
as
its
effects
were
so
great
when
its
vapour
was
confined
to
the
eye
i
was
led
to
apply
it
in
the
form
of
vapour
and
by
means
of
glass
bottles
similar
to
those
i
have
described
by
these
means
i
excluded
the
action
of
the
medicine
from
the
external
air
and
thereby
prevented
its
speedy
evaporation
when
it
had
been
applied
about
one
minute
the
patient
felt
the
part
very
cold
but
immediately
after
a
gradual
heat
accompanied
with
great
prickling
the
heat
increasing
the
longer
the
medicine
was
kept
in
contact
with
the
part
until
it
could
be
no
longer
endured
on
removing
the
glass
the
part
was
red
to
an
extent
two
or
three
times
greater
than
the
part
enclosed
in
a
few
days
the
change
in
the
size
of
the
glands
was
very
great
and
by
its
daily
repetition
a
complete
and
speedy
removal
of
the
disease
was
effected
i
also
find
that
its
action
upon
diseased
glands
is
more
decided
if
the
surface
of
the
skin
is
well
moistened
with
water
previous
to
the
application
of
the
bottle
to
the
part
the
water
in
fact
not
only
prevents
the
escape
of
the
vapour
between
the
glass
and
the
skin
but
assists
the
imbibition
of
the
carbon
a
point
of
the
highest
importance
inasmuch
as
all
its
action
on
the
part
depends
upon
the
exclusion
of
the
atmosphere
from
the
vapour
i
may
here
observe
that
these
applications
occasion
no
injury
whatever
to
the
skin
i
have
also
found
the
of
and
the
chlorocyanic
acid
valuable
medicines
in
the
removal
of
deafness
depending
upon
a
want
of
nervous
energy
and
deficiency
of
wax
the
mode
of
its
application
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
which
i
employ
in
diseases
of
the
eye
with
this
difference
only
that
the
bottle
is
formed
with
a
small
neck
and
stopper
adapted
to
the
size
of
the
orifice
of
the
ear
and
held
close
to
the
organ
until
a
considerable
degree
of
warmth
is
produced
the
action
of
these
medicines
which
contain
so
large
a
share
of
carbon
arises
from
the
carbon
in
the
vapour
permeating
the
cuticle
and
coming
in
contact
with
the
oxygen
in
the
vessels
which
is
conveyed
through
every
part
of
the
frame
by
inspiration
and
otherwise
and
thereby
forming
carbonic
acid
gas
which
evolves
heat
in
the
ratio
of
the
quantity
consumed
by
the
oxygen
the
following
quotations
from
professor
liebig
in
his
work
on
organic
chemistry
sufficiently
prove
the
correctness
of
this
position
it
is
only
in
those
parts
of
the
body
to
which
arterial
blood
and
with
it
the
oxygen
absorbed
in
respiration
is
conveyed
that
heat
is
produced
hair
wool
or
feathers
do
not
possess
an
elevated
temperature
this
high
temperature
of
the
animal
body
or
as
it
may
be
called
disengagement
of
heat
is
uniformly
and
under
all
circumstances
the
result
of
the
combination
of
a
combustible
substance
with
oxygen
in
whatever
way
carbon
may
combine
with
oxygen
the
act
of
combination
can
not
take
place
without
the
disengagement
of
heat
we
can
no
longer
doubt
that
gases
of
every
kind
whether
soluble
or
insoluble
in
water
possess
the
property
of
permeating
animal
tissues
as
water
penetrates
unsized
paper
does
not
the
action
of
medicines
containing
so
large
a
portion
of
carbon
which
can
be
brought
into
contact
with
the
whole
external
surface
of
the
body
and
thereby
capable
of
being
easily
disengaged
suggest
a
method
of
relieving
pulmonary
disease
likely
to
be
attended
with
no
ordinary
success
by
calling
into
greater
activity
the
action
of
the
skin
and
thereby
materially
lightening
the
labour
of
the
lungs
are
we
not
the
more
encouraged
to
expect
such
remedial
influence
in
diseases
of
the
lungs
from
the
fact
of
its
great
power
in
removing
indurated
glands
which
are
so
common
accompaniments
of
consumption
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
usefulness
of
bisulphuret
of
carbon
in
skin
diseases
i
have
submitted
these
observations
under
the
conviction
that
they
embody
principles
which
may
be
carried
out
and
made
of
great
utility
to
mankind
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
turnbull
russell
square
a
few
weeks
after
the
appearance
of
the
above
i
wrote
to
the
editor
of
the
as
follows
remarks
on
the
action
of
carbon
etc
the
editor
of
literary
gazette
russell
square
sir
i
beg
leave
to
tender
my
sincerest
thanks
for
your
kind
notice
in
the
last
of
my
recent
discoveries
on
the
treatment
of
diseases
of
the
eye
allow
me
to
intrude
for
once
in
your
crowded
columns
by
referring
to
what
you
accidentally
omitted
viz
the
manner
of
applying
the
of
and
also
to
add
a
few
reasons
illustrative
of
the
fact
which
you
have
quoted
from
me
that
its
action
depends
on
its
union
with
the
oxygen
the
plan
i
adopt
is
this
i
put
a
drachm
of
the
bisulphuret
of
carbon
into
a
bottle
the
medicine
is
so
volatile
that
the
heat
of
the
hand
causes
the
vapour
rapidly
to
rise
and
come
into
contact
with
the
skin
the
action
is
more
decided
if
the
skin
is
previously
moistened
with
water
as
the
water
not
only
prevents
the
escape
of
the
vapour
between
the
glass
and
the
skin
but
also
excludes
the
external
air
a
point
of
the
very
highest
importance
in
my
paper
which
appeared
in
the
of
october
i
stated
that
when
it
had
been
applied
about
one
minute
the
patient
felt
the
part
very
cold
but
immediately
after
a
gradual
heat
accompanied
with
great
prickling
the
heat
increasing
the
longer
the
medicine
was
kept
in

with
the

until
it
could
no
longer
be
endured
on
removing
the

the

aged

says
that
he
has
been
nearly
blind
in
the
right
eye
from
since
he
was
two
years
old
five
years
since
he
was
attacked
with
violent
ophthalmia
in
consequence
of
exposure
to
cold
he
then
applied
to
one
of
our
ophthalmic
institutions
where
he
remained
as
an
for
eight
months
for
the
first
six
months
he
had
thrice
a
week
caustic
applied
to
his
left
eye
after
which
black
ointment
for
the
remainder
of
the
time
but
without
receiving
benefit
he
then
went
to
another
institution
where
he
remained
an
for
seven
months
the
treatment
here
consisted
in
dropping
into
the
eye
a
liquid
and
at
other
times
a
powder
was
shaken
into
it
from
which
he
derived
no
benefit
he
then
consulted
a
private
practitioner
who
relieved
him
but
not
satisfied
with
this
he
went
to
another
surgeon
who
said
that
the
cause
of
his
blindness
was
owing
to
a
little
squint
and
he
submitted
the
eye
to
be
operated
upon
for
that
purpose
but
no
good
was
derived
from
this
operation
none
of
the
medical
men
attempted
to
do
anything
to
the
right
eye
in
september
when
i
first
saw
him
his
left
eye
was
very
much
diminished
in
size
and
the
cornea
studded
with
white
spots
the
vision
very
imperfect
and
constantly
discharging
water
the
right
eye
was
so
opaque
that
neither
iris
nor
pupil
was
to
be
seen
and
he
could
only
see
the
shadow
of
an
object
on
the
of

the
left

had
got
tolerably
clear
and
free
from
all

she
attended
for

without
any

she
was
brought
to

by
her

on
the
of

who
stated
that
for
the

four

she
had
been

and
could
only
discern
the

could
not

them
on
examining
the

i
found
it
shut
and
all
the
humours
lost
the
right
eye
was
much
diminished
in
size
and
the
cornea
was
very
opaque
excepting
at
the
upper
part
where
a
small
portion
of
light
was
admitted
the
bottle
containing
the
acid
was
held
to
the

as
well
as
to
the

to
ascertain
what
effect
would
be
produced
to
my
surprise
in
the
period
of
a
month
the
chambers
of
the

became
partially
filled
with
aqueous
humours
to
the
extent
of
at

half
the

the
pupil
was
small

the

could
not

the

has
become
almost
transparent

she
can
now
see
with

indeed
her

he
was
attacked
with
acute
inflammation
in
both
eyes
in
he
at
first
had
the
advice
of
private
practitioners
and
subsequently
went
to
two
different
ophthalmic
hospitals
he
remained
in
one
eleven
months
in
the
other
fifteen
it
appears
from
his
own
account
that
his
sufferings
were
very
great
for
he
asserts
his
eyes
and
were
swollen
very
much
the
treatment
consisted
in
bleeding
cupping
on
the

lancing
frequently
the
eye

was
applied

the
of

was
sent
to
me
from
the
board

scarcely
discern

said
that
he
had
been
led
about
for
the
last
three
years
the
left
eye
was
afflicted
with
staphyloma
and
was
perfectly
opaque
the

covered
with
a
dense
opacity

much
so
that
no
appearance
of

pupil
could
be
discerned
through
it
the
right
was
not
so
unnaturally
prominent
as
was
the
left
eye
the
vapour
in
this
case
was
daily
applied
and
the
progress
of
cure
was
so
rapid
that
in
the
course
of
a
month
he
was
able
to
come
to
me
from
james
without
his
accustomed
guide
at
christmas
he
obtained
permission
from
the
board
to
be
absent
for
a
few
days
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
his
wife
and
children
it
was
his
wish
to
see
the
faces
of
those
near

him

for
some
months
previously

felt
himself
gradually
losing
the
sight
of
his
right
eye
he
went
to
an
ophthalmic
institution
and
in
two
or
three
days
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
attack
of
ophthalmia
which
he
attributed
to
the
applications
used
for
his
recovery
he
did
not
know
the
nature
of
the
ointment
inserted
in
his
eyes
but
was
told
it
was
black
ointment
in
ten

remained
for

liquid
was

was
cupped
in
the
temples
the
eyes
were
scarified
aperient
medicines
were
given
and

used
the
inflammation
still
continued
and

was
unable
to
lift
his
head
or
allow
the
bandages
to
be
taken
off
his
forehead
without
experiencing
the
most
excruciating
pain
in
this
state

was
brought
to
me
on
the
of
september
when
i
ordered
for
each
eye
two
drops
of
the
oil
of
almonds
after
being
warmed
to
be
put
into
the
eyes
the
relief
that
he
experienced
was
so
great
that
he
said
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
another
world
in
eight
days
the
pain
had
greatly
diminished
he
was
enabled
to
open
his
but
could
discern
no
object
whatever
i
then
ordered
castor
oil
to
be
dropped
into
each
eye
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
opacity
he
left
me
at
the
end
of
december
at
which
time
he
could
see
very
imperfectly
but
returned
to
me
in
january
when
the
opacity
of
the
cornea
still
continued
he
has
had
almost
daily
the
prussic
acid

applied
to

aunt
states
that
this
patient
has
been
blind
since
she
was
six
days
old
in
consequence
of
an
attack
of
inflammation
which
gave
rise
to
a
great
discharge
from
the
eyes
in
her
infancy
fluids
of
various
kinds
were
injected
underneath
the
and
when
four
months
old
she
was
taken
for
three
years
regularly
to
an
ophthalmic
hospital
where
she
was
told
that
the
right
eye
was
destroyed
the
left
eye
had
caustic
applied
to
it
for
a
length
of
time
thrice
a
week
ointment
was
then
applied
underneath
the
until
the
eye
became
so
very
large
that
she
was
at
last
told
that
it
was
a
hopeless
case
and
that
no
more
could
be
done
for
her
her
next
visit
was
to
an
eminent
oculist
who
said
he
would
not
undertake
the
treatment
of
such
a
case
she
then
went
to
another
ophthalmic
institution
where
she
remained
for
about
two
years
without
deriving
any
improvement
in
her
sight
but
she
was
relieved
from
much
pain
i
saw
her
first
on
the
of
april
when
the
appearance
of
the
left
eye
seemed
to
be
at
least
twice
the
size
of
a
natural
eye
it
was
of
a
colour
standing
out
beyond
the
lids
and
where
the
pupil
ought
to
have
been
there
was
a
blue
circular
ring
of
lighter
hue
than
the
rest
of
the
eye
and
in
the
centre
of
this
ring
was
a
white
body
about
the
size
of
a
pea
the
right
eye
was
quite
a
contrast
for
it
appeared
perfectly
white
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
iris
or
pupil
the
eyes
were
continually
rolling
about
in
their
sockets
looking
at
the
little
creature
i
said
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
in
such
a
fearful
case
without
waiting
for
a
reply
i
said
i
will
endeavour
to
diminish
the
size
of
the
eye
but
unquestionably
no
hope
can
be
held
out
that
i
can
restore
the
use
of
sight
i
at
first
put
daily
a
drop
of
castor
oil
into
each
eye
occasionally
substituting
for
the
castor
oil
the
oil
of
almonds
this
treatment
in
about
two
months
diminished
much
the
size
of
both
eyes
and
the
opacity
of
the
right
eye
greatly
decreased
so
much
so
that
a
little
edge
of
the
pupil
became
visible
and
the
child
began
to
see
and
in
four
months
she
could
walk
alone
shortly
afterwards
the
pupil
could
be
distinctly
seen
and
there
appeared
a
white
speck
upon
the
anterior
capsule
of
the
lens
she
ceased
to
be
a
patient
of
mine
in
december
but
returned
in
january
when
the
prussic
acid
was
daily
applied
to
both
eyes
the
left
eye
is
diminished
about
in
size
and
light
is
becoming
perceptible
the
right
has
assumed
a
healthy
appearance
the
cornea
is
transparent
and
there
is
still
a
spot
upon
the
capsule
about
the
size
of
the
eighth
part
of
the
pupil
this
does
not
appear
to
impede
the
vision
she
can
now
read
with
the
eye
the
raised
letters
with
great
quickness
she
was
formerly
taught
to
read
the
letters
with
her
fingers
she
is
also
learning
to
read
common
print
when
the
child
came
to
me
i
had
not
had
sufficient
experience
of
the
effects
of
the
prussic
acid
vapour
and
i
hesitated
in
using
a
remedy
of
such
acknowledged
potency
until
i
had
with
great
care
thoroughly
investigated
its
properties
this
i
have
been
engaged
in
doing
for
several
years
and
i
am
now
able
to
state
that
in
no
case
in
which
i
have
used
it
has
it
been
attended
with
any
injurious

inflammation
of

was
subjected

very
active
antiphlogistic
treatment
the
inflammatory
symptoms
subsided
after
which
she
was
regularly
led
for
five
years
to
an
ophthalmic
institution
at
which
place
the
right
eye
was
operated
upon
five
times
in
addition
to
which
she
was
cupped
three
times
and
bled
from
the

caustic
was
applied
frequently
to
the
inside
of
the
she
was
also
blistered

the
ear
and
nape
of
the
neck
the
patient
was
unable
to
walk
about
without
assistance
if
she
attempted
to
do
so
she
was
knocked
and
jostled
about
on
the

her

brought
her
to

to
ascertain
whether

the

assumed

cleared
off

its

to

the

the
arising
from
the
of
both
eyes
being
turned
in
she
was
an
to
one
of
the
ophthalmic
hospitals
for
two
years
but
instead
of
getting
better
she
became
worse
she
then
applied
to
another
ophthalmic
institution
where
she
was
subjected
to
treatment
for
four
months
but
no
improvement
took
place
three
years
ago
her
sufferings
prompted
her
to
visit
a
third
institution
when
one
of
the
surgeons
cut
off
the
upper
eyelid
of
the
left
eye
which
gave
rise
to
great
pain
and
inflammation
but
the
opacity
was
not
diminished
nor
the
vision
improved
she
was
obliged
during
the
eight
years
to
have
her
constantly
pulled
out
she
visited
me
on
the
of
october
when
the
of
the
right
eye
both
above
and
below
were
still
turned
in
and
rubbing
against
the
cornea
the
were
exceedingly
red
the
cornea
of
both
eyes
was
nearly
opaque
and
only
a
small
portion
of
the
pupil
could
be
observed
through
the
opacity
her
vision
was
so
imperfect
that
she
could
do
little
more
than
find
her
way
about
she
was
often
confined
to
the
house
for
a
week
at
a
time
through
inflammation
the
vapour
was
only
applied
for
the
space
of
a
week
after
which
she
could
see
much
better
the
opacity
was
greatly
diminished
and
the
began
to
resume
their
proper
position
she
continues
to
use
the
prussic
acid
vapour
three
or
four
times
a
week
and
at
the
present
time
she
is
able
to
follow
her
occupations
with
comfort
and
the
eye
is
resuming
all
the
appearance
of
health
she
never
has
had
occasion
to
pull
one
out
since
i
first
saw
her
she
is
now
very
comfortable
and
can
see
tolerably
well
this
is
the
first
case
of
the
kind
that
i
have
treated
with
prussic
acid
case
william
stevens
aged
at
no
gracechurch
street
states
that
he
had
been
for
several
months
at
two
different
ophthalmic
institutions
where
many
modes
of
treatment
were
adopted
to
improve
his
vision
but
he
was
at
length
told
they
could
do
him
no
good
as
the
disease
under
which
he
laboured
was
conical
eyes
when
i
examined
him
in
may
i
found
the
right
eye
so
prominent
that
it
had
the
appearance
as
if
a
large
transparent
bead
had
grown
from
the
cornea
with
this
eye
he
could
see
a
short
distance
the
conical
state
was
not
only
greater
in
the
left
eye
but
there
was
an
opacity
on
the
apex
of
the
cornea
he
could
see
nothing
with
it
if
the
right
eye
were
shut
unless
the
objects
of
vision
came
in
contact
with
his
face
he
continued
to
visit
me
professionally
two
or
three
times
a
week
for
four
months
and
had
a
drop
or
two
of
castor
oil
put
into
both
eyes
each
time
this
treatment
greatly
diminished
the
prominency
of
the
right
eye
and
lengthened
the
vision
but
the
left
eye
was
only
slightly
benefited
by
it
although
all
opacity
had
been
removed
and
it
had
diminished
in
size
in
december
last
he
again
called
upon
me
and
wished
to
know
if
more
could
not
be
done
for
him
he
said
he
had
continued
to
follow
his
business
with
the
use
of
concave
glasses
but
saw
with
great
difficulty
the
vapour
was
employed
thrice
a
week
for
about
three
weeks
when
his
vision
was
restored
to
its
natural
length
i
saw
him
on
the
of
january
and
he
said
he
was
perfectly
well
and
could
follow
his
business
with
great
pleasure
to
himself
case
of
the
left
eye
and
cataract
of
the
george
trousdale
aged
william
street
hampstead
road
says
that
when
he
was
years
of
age
a
shoemaker
awl
was
accidentally
pushed
through
the
right
eyelid
into
the
eye
which
gave
rise
to
an
attack
of
severe
inflammation
in
both
eyes
when
the
inflammation
subsided
he
found
the
vision
of
the
right
eye
entirely
gone
the
left
eye
became
dim
in
may
last
and
his
sight
was
much
disturbed
by
floating
clouds
passing
before
the
eye
when
he
looked
steadily
at
an
object
the
vision
almost
vanished
he
experienced
great
pain
in
the
forehead
and
temple
on
the
same
side
he
applied
to
an
infirmary
where
he
remained
as
an
for
six
weeks
he
was
salivated
cupped
and
leeched
he
was
then
told
that
the
right
eye
was
of
no
use
and
they
feared
the
vision
of
the
left
also
was
destroyed
he
then
went
to
an
ophthalmic
institution
where
he
remained
as
an
for
seven
weeks
he
was
again
salivated
a
liquid
was
dropped
into
his
eye
regularly
and
he
was
blistered
but
no
good
resulted
he
then
went
to
a
private
oculist
under
whose
care
he
remained
for
six
weeks
he
again
was
salivated
but
still
the
sight
became
more
obscured
and
the
pains
in
his
forehead
and
temple
more
acute
i
saw
him
first
in
october
he
was
then
suffering
from
severe
pain
in
the
forehead
and
temple
the
left
eye
was
so
blind
that
he
could
not
distinguish
even
when
placed
close
beside
it
a
large
bookcase
he
said
he
could
scarcely
guide
himself
in
the
street
the
pupil
was
almost
immoveable
there
was
a
white
cataract
in
the
right
eye
and
a
total
want
of
vision
he
has
had
the
vapour
of
the
prussic
acid
applied
to
both
eyes
almost
daily
since
october
he
can
now
with
the
left
eye
read
print
and
is
free
from
all
pain
nearly
the
upper
half
of
the
cataract
of
the
right
eye
is
absorbed
and
he
is
beginning
to
see
with
it
this
case
shows
the
power
of
the
acid
in
not
only
producing
absorption
but
in
the
removal
of
amaurosis
at
the
same
time
unless
the
capsule
of
the
lens
had
been
lacerated
by
the
awl
i
do
not
think
that
the
acid
could
have
had
any
power
in
causing
absorption
in
a
case
of
cataract
which
had
existed
for
the
long
period
of
years
he
is
still
under
treatment
case
monro
aged
at
no
featherstone
buildings
twelve
years
ago
had
violent
inflammation
occasioned
by
the
lash
of
a
whip
striking
the
left
eye
from
which
time
he
has
been
unable
to
see
more
than
the
shadow
of
an
object
he
says
that
many
have
advised
him
to
submit
to
an
operation
for
cataract
but
others
have
recommended
him
not
to
do
so
as
long
as
one
eye
remained
sound
on
the
of
may
when
he
applied
to
me
i
tried
as
an
experiment
the
vapour
of
the
prussic
acid
which
was
employed
for
about
three
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
could
see
different
objects
and
discern
countenances
when
the
other
eye
was
closed
afterwards
he
went
into
the
country
where
he
remained
without
using
any
medicine
on
his
return
to
town
on
the
of
january
he
called
upon
me
when
i
found
the
eye
was
not
improved
in
appearance
he
is
now
again
under
my
care
and
has
had
the
vapour
applied
five
times
it
appears
to
produce
a
very
decided
effect
upon
the
vision
in
three
or
four
parts
the
cataract
appears
as
if
it
had
been
operated
upon
with
a
couching
needle
this
is
a
case
of
great
interest
and
it
is
impossible
for
any
unprejudiced
person
to
doubt
the
great
absorbent
powers
of
prussic
acid
in
many
diseases
of
the
eye
but
i
am
certain
it
will
not
be
a
general
remedy
for
lenticular
cataract
unless
employed
in
its
incipient
state
without
operation
unless
aided
by
rupturing
the
capsule
of
the
lens
by
the
needle
first
many
are
the
cases
where
we
want
such
a
solvent

operations
case

carman
great
wilde

has
been
blind
in
her
right
eye
since
she
was
two
years
old
the
left
eye
is
unaffected
when
two
years
of
age
she
was
taken
to
an
ophthalmic
hospital
where
various
modes
of
treatment
were
adopted
for
the
recovery
of
the
eye
until
the
month
of
march
when
she
went
to
another
ophthalmic
hospital
where
she
attended
for
six
months
but
received
no
benefit
on
the
of
june
the
rev
peter
hall
of
long
acre
chapel
brought
her
to
me
and
when
examined
in
a
strong
light
with
her
face
towards
the
window
we
could
not
perceive
the
slightest
action
of
the
pupil
hall
and
i
tried
her
with
a
sheet
of
white
paper
moving
it
before
her
eyes
several
times
but
she
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
it
after
the
eye
was
exposed
to
the
vapour
of
prussic
acid
for
a
short
time
the
pupil
acted
slightly
when
exposed
to
light
and
she
was
able
not
only
to
see
the
paper
but
to
take
hold
of
it
with
her
hand
and
could
walk
round
the
table
when
the
left
eye
was
shut
she
continued
the
vapour
four
or
five
times
weekly
for
the
space
of
six
weeks
when
she
left
me
the
eye
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
answer
all
ordinary
purposes
of
vision
although
not
quite
equal
to
the
other
i
have
examined
her
and
find
the
improvement
continues

aged
daughter
of

fetter
lane
and
one
of
the
scholars
at
the
blind
school
queen
square
her
mother
said
that
she
took
her
daughter
to
an
ophthalmic
institution
until
she
was
tired
no
good
was
effected
the
parents
of
this
case
were
unable
to
say
when
the
blindness
first
developed
itself
she
has
always
been
able
to
see
a
little
with
the
right
eye
i
was
first
consulted
in
this
case
in
july
when
the
right
eye
appeared
to
have
some
vision
the
pupil
acted
under
a
strong
light
but
very
sluggishly
she
could
observe
objects
very
indistinctly
with
the
left
eye
the
prussic
acid
was
employed
almost
daily
for
three
months
to
both
eyes
the
right
eye
recovered
so
that
she
can
now
thread
her
needle
she
is
also
learning
to
read
upon
the
pupil
of
the
left
eye
the
prussic
acid
does
not
appear
to
have
the
least
effect
as
a
general
rule
i
have
found
that
when
prussic
acid
does
not
dilate
the
eye
in
amaurosis
much
good
is
not
to
be
expected
from
its
use
in
such
cases
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
disease
is
caused
by
pressure
upon
the
optic
nerve
it
is
my
intention
to
persevere
in
the
application
of
the
vapour
to
the
left
eye
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
the
sight
may
not
be
restored
i
do
not
despair
of
success

this
patient
has
been
totally
blind
from
birth
his
case
has
been
examined
by
almost
all
the
eminent
oculists
of
london
and
has
been
taken
to
several
hospitals
but
all
the
medical
men
without
one
exception
stated
that
they
would
not
prescribe
for
him
as
they
could
do
nothing
for
him
he
was
brought
to
me
in
may
at
which
time
the
eye
appeared
more
than
half
sunk
in
each
orbit
and
the
pupil
when
exposed
to
the
action
of
strong
light
was
fixed
and
immoveable
in
fact
he
had
not
the
slightest
perception
of
light
two
drops
of
castor
oil
were
put
into
his
eye
daily
for
the
space
of
three
months
before
the
pupil
manifested
a
disposition
to
act
at
each
successive
month
there
was
a
visible
change
in
the
size
of
the
eye
when
he
left
me
in
he
was
not
able
to
discern
more
than
light
from
darkness
he
has
visited
me
since
the
month
of
april
and
has
had
once
or
twice
a
week
the
vapour
of
the
prussic
acid
applied
to
his
eye
he
is
now
so
improved
that
he
is
beginning
to
distinguish
one
object
from
another
and
the
eye
is
assuming
a
healthy
appearance
from
the
progress
that
this
boy
has
made
the
last
two
months
i
think
it
probable
that
the
medicine
may
ultimately
effect
much
greater
good

my
dear
sir
having
by
the
vapour
of
prussic
acid
been
nearly
cured
by
yourself
of
an
opacity
of
the
cornea
which
for
twenty
years
past
had
rendered
the
sight
of
my
left
eye
of
little
worth
more
than
to
distinguish

from

and
firmly
believing
that
when

shall
be
able
to
replace

my
sight
will
be
perfectly
restored

extract
from
a
letter
of
professor
forbes
of
king
college
aberdeen
i
seized
the
first
hour
which
i
could
command
after
receiving
your
note
to
call
on
milne
that
i
might
see
in
what
state
he
was
as
i
had
not
heard
of
him
for
some
time
i
was
also
desirous
of
having
the
particulars
of
his
case
accurately
from
himself
john
milne
was
a
cooper
and
in
that
capacity
had
gone
with
the
to
davis
straits
and
greenland
for
sixteen
years
in
july
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
inflammation
in
one
of
his
eyes
which
soon
extended
to
the
other
after
two
years
he
became
so
blind
that
he
could
not
walk
with
safety
in
the
streets
and
after
meeting
with
a
severe
accident
from
his
want
of
sight
he
gave
up
attempting
to
walk
out
alone
he
continued
for
more
than
two
years
in
this
state
always
becoming
worse
and
worse
in
his
sight
his
were
covered
with
ulcers
he
suffered
extreme
pain
except
when
lying
in
bed
with
the
room
quite
darkened
and
was
at
various
times
confined
for
six
weeks
without
being
able
to
bear
the
admission
of
light
into
his
room
during
the
whole
of
this
long
period
he
was
under
medical
treatment
by
different
surgeons
without
deriving
any
benefit
but
on
the
contrary
his
case
seemed
to
become
daily
more
hopeless
the
only
relief
indeed
which
he
experienced
was
he
says
from
the
division
of
the
from
time
to
time
with
which
the
was
covered
in
these
circumstances
he
was
brought
to
you
by
a
surgeon
who
had
attended
him
and
began
under
your
direction
the
application
of
the
prussic
acid
vapour
this
gave
him
immediate
relief
and
in
six
weeks
the
whole
ulcers
had
disappeared
light
was
no
longer
troublesome
to
him
and
he
saw
quite
well
to
go
about
his
business
and
to
read
this
was
his
state
in
autumn
at
which
time
i
first
saw
him
and
he
continues
equally
well
down
to
the
present
date
a
slight
opacity
in
the
cornea
of
both
eyes
still
remains
and
he
can
not
expose
himself
to
the
blaze
of
a
very
bright
day
or
to
violent
winds
for
a
length
of
time
without
experiencing
a
return
of
uneasiness
he
is
however
quite
positive
that
had
he
continued
under
your
care
for
a
sufficient
period
he
would
have
quite
recovered
and
he
has
been
planning
a
voyage
to
london
to
have
your
additional
advice
i
discovered
however
from
him
that
he
has
never
got
prussic
acid
of
sufficient
since
you
left
this
for
it
has
never
had
the
power
of
bringing
on
the
state
of
the
eye
which
the
strong
acid
did
and
which
he
found
to
be
attended
with
so
good
effects
i
have
taken
means
to
get
the
acid
prepared
for
him
of
the
right
strength
and
hope
that
its
application
will
be
as
efficacious
as
he
so
confidently
expects

formidable
complaint

was
treated
according
to
the
approved
methods
both
at
two
public
institutions
and
by
private
practitioners
for
some
months
without
any
apparent
advantage
when
i
was
applied
to
i
instantly
determined
on
a
trial
of
the
prussic
acid
vapour
having
read
in
your
able
journal
an
account
of
this
new
remedy
some
time
before
after
fourteen
applications
the
opaqueness
and
prominence
abated
considerably
and
the
eye
is
now
very
serviceable
and
nearly
as
useful
as
the
sound
one
no
inflammation
or
appearance
of
irritation
being
observable
the
plan
adopted
by
me
was
most
simple
the
affected
eye
open
was
placed
over
a
phial
containing
about
half
an
ounce
of
the
acid
while
the
patient
hand
properly
directed
was
to
retain
it
in
the
position
that
was
thought
necessary
the
time
occupied
in
this
operation
was
from
five
minutes
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
eye
became
in
a
short
time
inflamed
the
conjunctiva
exhibiting
the
appearance
of
deep
injection
which
gradually
disappeared
in
a
few
hours
but
which
was
not
accompanied
by
any
pain
no
paralysis
of
any
of
the
appendages
of
the
eye
has
resulted
from
the
application
such
is
the
outline
of
the
case
i
feel
assured
that
this
remedy
will
prove
a
powerful
auxiliary
in
the
hands
of
a
extract
from
the
of
january
cases
in
which
the
vapour
of
prussic
acid
was
employed
for
the
cure
of
ophthalmic
disease
by

maclean
lic
roy
surg
in
edinburgh
i
have
been
induced
for
my
own
satisfaction
in
consequence
of
some
observations
made
by
sir
george
sinclair
who
had
witnessed
its
effects
on
patients
under
turnbull
care
to
give
a
very
extended
trial
to
the
prussic
acid
in
cases
of
ophthalmic
disease
which
might
be
considered
suitable
for
its
application
and
desire
that
the
results
of
some
of
the
cases
should
be
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
those
of
our
profession
who
may
take
an
interest
in
the
subject
i
have
therefore
made
out
a
report
of
the
following
cases
in
our
present
state
of
knowledge
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
of
the
prussic
acid
it
will
be
sufficient
meantime
to
observe
accurately
and
merely
give
the
results
of
treatment
in
what
kind
of
cases
it
will
be
found
most
suitable
can
only
be
determined
by
further
inquiry
and
experience
if
however
the
results
prove
permanent
the
prussic
acid
must
occupy
a
very
high
place
amongst
our
remedial
agents
and
possessing
stimulant
properties
of
a
peculiar
character
it
may
prove
useful

many
circumstances

of

and

this
woman
being
altogether
an
object
of
charity
her
friends
solicited
me
to
take
up
her
case
of
which
i
was
not
at
all
sanguine
however
having
previously
perused
with
much
pleasure
a
brief
extract
by
turnbull
on
the
fumes
of
prussic
acid
as
a
valuable
remedy
in
certain
diseases
of
the
eye
i
was
led
to
make
trial
of
a
few
applications
of
it
in
the
above
case
according
to
his
method
and
i
must
candidly
confess
that
ere
long
i
was
completely
astonished
on
observing
the
rapid
effect
it
produced
on
the
opaque
cornea
before
mentioned
more
so
as
the
longer
i
cautiously
and
perseveringly
used
it
the
greater
in
proportion
did
the
inspissated
lymph
become
absorbed
and
the
layers
of
the
cornea
over
a
wide
space
begin
to
assume
their
natural
transparency
as
also
in
dilating
the
pupil
to
a
considerable
extent
so
much
indeed
that
before
one
month
under
its
use
she
could
observe
objects
in
a
very
different
light
and
ere
another
had
elapsed
she
could
find
her
way
out
of
doors
by
herself
and
come
to
my
residence
for
any
medicine
she
required
since
which
she
has
gone
on
gradually
to
progress
favourably
without
any
more
applications
and
the
vision
is
now
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
go
about
free
from
the
dread
she
had
before
or
the
use
of
a
guide
during
the
use
of
this
potent
remedy
it
struck
me
very
forcibly
that
the
extract
of
belladonna
might
assist
the
case
considerably
more
especially
when
one
had
reasons
for
suspecting
adhesions
to
exist
in
keeping
up
a
greater
effect
on
the
pupil
than
that
arising
from
the
use
of
the
acid
which
every
one
will
admit
at
once
who
has
seen
its
powers
depicted
upon
the
human
eye
to
be
only
temporary
and
i
believe
still
less
so
in
disease
of
the
cornea
and
iris
than
in
any
other
incident
to
such
an
organ
with
such
an
object
in
view
and
after
once
applying
the
extract
smeared
round
the
eye
at
i
soon
found
it
to
be
also
of
considerable
service
along
with
the
daily
use
of
the
fumes
of
the
acid
which
were
both
afterwards
employed
assiduously
in
this
manner
for
the
rest
of
the
treatment
but
in
drawing
my
remarks
to
a
close
at
this
time
i
can
not
refrain
from
saying
less
in
regard
to
the
utility
which
is
likely
to
arise
from
this
medicine
when
properly
applied
than
that
in
such
a
similar
case
as
i
have
stated
i
would
not
for
a
moment
hesitate
again
in
giving
it
and
the
extract
of
belladonna
a
fair
trial
so
convinced
am
i
now
after
employing
it
pretty
freely
by
itself
in
different
affections
of
the
same
organ
in
all
of
which
more
or
less
improvement
of
vision
was
manifested
of
its
potency
to
remove
many
of
those
formidable
diseases
of
the
eye
more
especially
that
of
the
cornea
which
are
so
often
the
opprobium
of
our
art
however
before
i
have
done
it
is
but
justice
to
ascribe
this
noble
discovery
to
turnbull
whose
indefatigable
research
has
not
failed
to
find
out
others
no
less
wonderful
in
their
effects
as
they
are
useful
to
mankind
and
for
such

can
not
but

himself

chapter
ii
on
the
action
of
essential
oils
in
october
a
paper
of
mine
appeared
in
the
medical
and
surgical
stating
the
beneficial
action
of
a
concentrated
tincture
of
capsicum
for
diseases
of
the
eye
by
rubbing
it
for
a
few
minutes
daily
over
the
forehead
and
temples
with
a
sponge
soon
after
this
i
was
induced
to
try
what
effect
essential
oils
possessing
powerful
stimulating
properties
might
possess
in
removing
amaurosis
and
diseases
generally
of
the
eye

finding
great
utility
to
arise
from
the
use
of
the
cloves
and
pimento
it
appeared
by
no
means
undesirable
or
hopeless
to
administer
them
internally
for
the
same
complaints
in
order
to
shield
the
pungency
of
these
oils
i
united
them
with
calcined
magnesia
which
by
its
very
strong
affinity
with
these
essential
oils
forms
a
body
nearly
solid
and
thereby
removes
all
pungency
warmth
and
even
smell
for
in
this
state
it
requires
to
be
held
in
the
mouth
for
a
considerable
time
before
it
produces
any
warmth
or
pungency
they
are
thus
rendered
easily
taken
in
sufficient
quantity
without
heat
or
uneasiness

subjects
of

diseases
of

to
be

increase
the

give
a
greater

organs
and
thereby
produce

they
are
equally
useful

internal
administration
has
been

much
more
serviceable

chronic
diseases

eye
such
as

than
in
amaurosis
the
manner
of
using
the
embrocations
is
by
rubbing
the
forehead
and
temples
with
a
sponge
saturated
with
the
liquid
this
plan
alone
kept
up
daily
is
beneficial
but
the
efficacy
is
more
than
doubled
if
another

with
warm
or
cold
water
is
rubbed
upon
the
forehead
for
a
minute
afterwards
by
this
the
energy
of
the
medicines
in
inducing
a
free
circulation
is
greatly
augmented
and
greater
warmth
is
rapidly
developed
the
rationale
in
my
opinion
is
that
the
large
quantity
of
carbon
in
some
of
the
essential
oils
and
its
solubility
in
alcohol
permits
it
by
the
friction
to
pass
through
the
cuticle
and
unite
with
the
oxygen
as
the
oils
are
very
insoluble
in
water
and
as
the
alcohol
has
a
strong
affinity
for
the
water
the
carbon
is
more
readily
disengaged
and
forms
a
union
with
the
oxygen
in
the
vessels
and
thereby
produces
heat
and
great
activity
of
circulation
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
the
reason
why
many
bodies
are
so
pungent
when
put
into
the
mouth
i
have
only
given
two
cases
john
plunkett
and
william
dale
as
illustrative
of
the
action
of
the
essential
oils
it
will
be
seen
in
the
following
extract
from
tyrrell
on
the
eye
functional
amaurosis
arises
from
a
deficient
supply
of
red
blood
he
says
in
these
cases
there
always
exists
i
believe
a
want
of
general
power
and
vigour
of
circulation
at
first
but
in
some
instances
of
affection
of
this
kind
the
local
circulation
never
regains
its
proper
force
and
fulness
and
the
supply
of
blood
is
inadequate
to
support
the
functions
of
the
part
although
the
general
system
recovers
its
natural
tone
and
power
i
think
this
statement
very
correct
and
therefore
the
embrocations
producing
so
much
additional
circulation
point
out
at
once
the
essential
oils
along
with
the
water
as
its
proper
remedy
i
here
quote
magendie
who
corroborates

plan
which
i
adopt

medicines

useful

amaurosis
can
not
be
considered
as
a
simple
affection
of
the
optic
nerve
at
least
in
the
actual
state
of
the
science
it
is
generally
impossible
to
say
that
the
fifth
nerve
has
no
connexion
with
the
loss
of
sight
and
in
many
cases
the
connexity
is
evident
hence
a
rule
which
i
invariably
follow
of
addressing
my
remedies
in
the
first
instance
to
some
of
the
branches
of
the
frontal
nerve
and
i
have
frequently
had
the
satisfaction
of
observing
some
of
these
cases
of
incomplete
amaurosis
improve
sensibly
under
the
influence
of
therapeutic
agents
applied
to
the
fifth
pair
i
would
go
even
further
and
say
whenever
you
have
a
case
of
incipient
amaurosis
commence
by
acting
on
this
nerve
for
it
is
at
once
the
most
expeditious
and
efficient
method
i
can
not
however
quit
this
point
without
assuring
you
that
no
physician
is
capable
of
treating
diseases
of
the
eye
unless
fully
in
possession
of
the
facts
i
have
just
had
the
honour
of
explaining
to
you
these
facts
are
daily
becoming
more
numerous
and
more
convincing
and
already
a
considerable
number
of
our
younger
practitioners
who
devote
themselves
to
the
study
of
diseases
of
the
eye
are
fully
aware
of
the
immense
influence
of
the
fifth
pair
of
nerves
over
the
exercise
of
vision
page
to
resume
then
what
i
have
said
concerning
the
sense
of
vision
and
our
several
experiments
allow
me
once
more
to
impress
you
with
the
idea
that
sight
can
never
be
exercised
in
a
complete
and
perfect
manner
without
a
certain
influence
of
the
fifth
pair
of
nerves
destroy
that
influence
and
you
destroy
vision
this
is
all
we
know
upon
the
matter
for
up
to
the
present
moment
we
have
been
unable
to
determine
how
far
this
influence
extends
or
in
what
manner
it
is
communicated
of
john
plunkett
mermaid
gardens
hackney
formerly
an
attorney
clerk
visited
me
in
may
and
stated
that
he
had
been
blind
and
obliged
to
be
led
about
by
his
children
for
the
last
four
years
for
five
years
previously
his
sight
had
been
gradually
diminishing
he
further
stated
that
he
was
much
troubled
with
floating
images
before
his
right
eye
as
well
as
with
clouds
resembling
animals
strange
goblins
and
sometimes
with
flashes
of
lightning
vivid
red
changing
into
light
blue
one
great
peculiarity
of
this
miserable
man
case
was
that
when
he
threw
back
his
head
there
appeared
a
stream
of
blood
flowing
from
the
top
of
the
right
eye
to
the
centre
where
it
formed
into
a
circular
pool
about
the
size
of
a
split
pea
but
ultimately
it
became
as
large
as
a
shilling
it
often
remained
a
considerable
time
and
then
diminished
gradually
in
red
streaks
this
was
a
matter
of
great
alarm
to
him
he
had
been
at
several
ophthalmic
institutions
for
nine
years
previously
to
his
visiting
me
he
has
had
electricity
tartarate
of
antimony
blisters
issues
stramonium
mercury
until
it
produced
dysentery
and
almost
every
kind
of
treatment
that
could
be
suggested
tried
but
to
no
purpose
when
i
saw
him
the
pupil
was
immoveable
and
the
eye
dull
in
the
anterior
and
very
obscure
the
left
eye
was
destroyed
he
could
not
discern
in
a
bright
light
the
shadow
of
white
paper
when
it
was
moved
between
him
and
the
light
the
compound
embrocation
of
oil
of
cloves
was
used
by
rubbing
it
upon
the
forehead
and
temples
daily
and
in
the
space
of
twelve
days
he
was
able
to
discern
objects
and
could
touch
them
in
two
months
he
could
put
his
finger
through
a
ring
when
held
by
another
person
he
continued
occasionally
under
my
care
for
about
a
year
during
which
time
the
embrocation
was
regularly
used
he
could
walk
alone
and
the
eye
was
generally
useful
but
he
was
not
able
to
read
with
it
he
could
see
objects
at
the
distance
of
thirty
feet
the
last
month
he
has
visited
me
once
or
twice
a
week
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
prussic
acid
vapour
applied
to
his
eye
to
ascertain
if
the
sight
could
be
restored
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
follow
his
occupation
as
a
clerk
in
this
case
an
advantage
has
been
gained
the
patient
is
now
able
to
read
a
little
which
previously
to
the
use
of
the
prussic
acid
vapour
he
was
unable
to
do
william
dale
of
clarence
gardens
regent
park
visited
me
in
july
he
stated
that
with
his
right
eye
for
the
last
year
he
could
only
discern
light
from
darkness
and
that
for
several
months
before
he
was
much
troubled
by
clouds
and
spots
floating
before
his
eyes
the
evening
gaslight
produced
a
continued
flashing
of
light
from
his
eye
the
light
looked
as
if
surrounded
by
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
he
first
went
to
an
ophthalmic
hospital
where
he
was
blistered
on
the
temple
and
salivated
nux
vomica
produced
such
an
effect
upon
him
that
all
his
limbs
were
involuntarily
twitched
so
as
to
alarm
them
exceedingly
he
then
left
and
went
to
another
institution
for
three
months
and
at
length
was
told
that
the
optic
nerve
was
injured
so
as
to
render
a
restoration
of
vision
impossible
the
left
eye
when
looked
into
had
a
dark
green
muddy
hue
and
the
pupil
was
exceedingly
dilated
and
immoveable
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
an
object
placed
before
his
eyes
yet
he
states
that
he
could
distinguish
light
from
darkness
when
he
applied
to
me
i
had
the
compound
embrocation
of
pimento
applied
occasionally
to
the
forehead
and
temples
by
means
of
a
friction
sponge
during
the
first
month
he
was
able
to
discern
objects
and
colours
the
pupil
acted
under
the
impression
of
light
almost
equal
to
the
good
eye
it
was
not
until
this
application
had
been
used
for
a
year
that
the
patient
was
enabled
to
read
with
the
eye
i
saw
the
patient
this
day
the
of
the
eye
upon
examination
appeared
to
be
in
a
healthy
state
the
sight
was
not
so
good
as
when
he
left
me
and
after
he
left
off
the
applications
but
this
he
attributes
to
the
circumstance
of
his
general
health
not
being
good
owing
to
his
having
suffered
from
intermittent
fever
in
january
i
published
the
first
edition
of
my
work
upon
veratria
and
gave
an
account
of
two
cases
of
amaurosis
combined
with
cured
by
the
external
application
of
veratria
i
there
suggested
that
it
was
probable
that
amaurosis
uncombined
with
might
be
removed
by
applications
of
a
stimulating
nature
to
the
branches
of
the
fifth
pair
of
nerves
no
notice
of
this
suggestion
having
been
taken
by
medical
men
i
determined
to
put
the
plan
into
execution
and
employed
a
surgeon
to
carry
it
into
effect
in
giles
workhouse
where
blind
cases
were
given
me
for
that
purpose
i
here
extract
the
case
of
eleanor
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
power
of
capsicum
when
rubbed
upon
the
forehead
and
temples
i
select
this
case
of
amaurosis
for
several
reasons
she
was
the
first
patient
on
whom
i
tried
the
efficacy
of
capsicum
she
had
had
seven
years
previously
a
stroke
of
palsy
which
removed
all
power
of
the
right
side
the
only
power
recovered
was
that
of
the
right
arm
the
hearing
was
perfectly
gone
and
she
had
not
had
the
least
perception
of
sight
for
seven
years
it
is
now
nearly
eight
years
since
her
recovery
and
at
the
present
date
of
she
can
read
perfectly
well
and
has
never
had
another
application
since
the
three
first
days
it
will
also
satisfy
the
minds
of
many
that
a
recovery
by
stimulating
applications
of
this
description
is
not
of
a
temporary
nature
i
here
quote
the
case
as
given
in
my
work
on
painful
and
nervous
diseases
page
eleanor
aged
an
inmate
of
st
giles
workhouse
was
attacked
seven
years
ago
with
palsy
of
the
right
side
when
perception
of
light
and
sound
in
the
right
eye
and
ear
was
extinguished
there
was
a
constant
and
profuse
flow
of
tears
and
the
pupil
was
immoveable
the
treatment
commenced
on
the
of
october
and
was
continued
for
three
days
only
on
the
first
day
after
the
commencement
of
the
treatment
there
was
a
great
abatement
of
the
flow
of
tears
and
she
could
perceive
light
and
objects
on
the
second
day
she
could
see
a
watch
and
direct
her
hand
to
it
and
distinguish
the
palm
from
the
back
of
the
hand
on
the
third
day
she
could
distinguish
objects
with
great
facility
there
was
no
further
application
of
the
remedy
after
the
third
day
on
the
fifth
day
she
could
read
a
duodecimo
with
ease
on
the
seventh
day
the
flow
of
tears
ceased
the
pupil
moved
readily
and
her
sight
and
hearing
were
perfect
she
is
still
an
inmate
of
the
workhouse
and
may
be
seen
on
application
to
the
matron
mrs
bailey
the
next
case
which
i
select
from
the
same
work
is
that
of
alexander
cruikshanks
of
strathcathro
castle
forfarshire
when
this
case
came
under
my
care
he
was
undergoing
the
necessary
preparation
for
an
operation
for
cataract
the
peculiar
difference
in
the
removal
of
cataract
without
operation
is
that
the
person
afterwards
needs
no
cataract
glasses
as
will
be
seen
from
the
extracts
of
two
of
cruikshank
letters
to
the
author
it
is
now
seven
years
since
his
recovery
and
he
is
at
the
present
date
perfectly
well
march
my
right
eye
was
affected
with
dimness
or
defect
of
vision
so
long
ago
as
the
year
and
commenced
by
the
deceptious
effect
of
seeing
two
objects
distinctly
where
there
really
was
but
one
this
deception
of
double
vision
gradually
disappeared
as
the
vision
of
the
eye
became
imperfect
the
other
eye
was
not
affected
until
about
four
or
five
years
ago
the
affection
of
this
like
the
other
commenced
and
continued
with
the
double
vision
until
remedy
was
continued
six
weeks
when
it
totally
disappeared
the
right
eye
by
this
time
was
restored
to
such
a
healthy
state
that
i
could
read
magazine
or
the
leading
article
of
a
newspaper
without
glasses
and
the
smallest
print
with
them
by
the
way
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
that
it
was
not
till
july
last
that
i
ascertained
beyond
question
the
nature
of
the
complaint
with
which
i
was
affected
in
that
month
i
applied
to
an
eminent
oculist
who
after
two
examinations
informed
me
the
complaint
was
cataract
may
the
i
am
favoured
with
your
letter
of
the
instant
intimating
that
you
had
heard
it
reported
that
the
benefit
i
had
derived
from
your
treatment
of
my
eyes
had
disappeared
the
only
person
with
whom
i
have
had
any
communication
on
the
subject
is
my
friend
whom
i
informed
that
the
remedy
was
applied
to
my
forehead
and
temples
by
friction
only
without
your
having
prescribed
or
administered
one
grain
of
medicine
or
having
confined
me
to
the
house
or
directed
the
slightest
change
in
my
former
habits
of
living
either
as
to
drink
or
diet
and
that
my
sight
was
good
enough
to
read
write
fish
shoot
and
to
see
a
pin
on
the
floor
at
the
most
distant
corner
of
an
room
what
more
can
or
ought
a
man
of
years
of
age
wish
for
in
this
respect
but
if
any
are
sceptical
as
to
your
mode
of
treatment
let
them
produce
a
testimony
like
this
of
a
superior
method
my
dear
sir

faithfully

the
only
other
case
which
i
intend
to
quote
in
order
to
show
that
the
recoveries
are
lasting
when
the
essential
oils
have
been
employed
is
the
case
of
kent
this
gentleman
continues
perfectly
well
it
is
now
nearly
seven
years

from
the
patient

was
for

at

in

james
april
my
dear
sir
thinking
that
an
outline
of
the
principal
features
in
my
case
might
be
perused
with
advantage
by
many
who
take
an
interest
in
the
success
of
your
efforts
i
have
subjoined
it
in
as
concise
a
form
as
justice
to
the
subject
would
admit
upon
my
return
from
a
very
cold
ride
in
a
violent
storm
of
snow
and
sleet
on
the
evening
of
the
of
january
i
discovered
that
the
sight
of
my
right
eye
was
gone
in
a
few
hours
violent
inflammation
supervened
and
continued
several
weeks
in
spite
of
the
most
vigorous
and
energetic
treatment
its
principal
seat
being
the
optic
nerve
and
subsequently
the
iris
the
inflammation
was
at
length
overcome
but
vision
was
not
restored
and
the
irritability
in
both
eyes
was
so
great
as
to
render
it
absolutely
necessary
not
only
to
avoid
all
attempts
to
use
them
but
also
to
exclude
them
from
the
light
the
sight
of
the
right
eye
was
entirely
and
as
i
feared
irrecoverably
gone
its
pupil
contracted
almost
to
the
size
of
a
pin
point
and
immoveable
i
removed
to
the
country
by
the
advice
of
the
professional
friends
who
had
attended
me
in
the
hope
that
as
my
general
health
improved
the
irritability
would
subside
although
they
gave
me
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
organ
originally
diseased
would
ever
again
prove
of
much
use
to
me
in
this
opinion
a
medical
gentleman
of
high
celebrity
in
oxford
coincided
but
he
strongly
recommended
me
to
consult
some
of
the
most
eminent
oculists
in
the
metropolis
a
much
esteemed
friend
having
mentioned
your
success
in
the
treatment
of
many
obstinate
and
almost
inveterate
cases
i
placed
myself
under
your
care
on
the
of
april
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
after
the
lapse
of
three
or
four
days
a
very
considerable
alteration
was
observable
in
the
appearance
of
the
right
eye
and
that
my
perception
of
light
and
afterwards
of
objects
became
more
distinct
the
improvement
has
been
regularly
progressing
and
i
am
now
the
of
april
able
to
read
with
ease
with
that
eye
which
only
three
weeks
ago
could
scarce
distinguish
light
from
darkness
i
may
also
add
that
the
irritability
which
so
long
annoyed
me
ceased
almost
immediately
after
your
first
application
and
i
have
not
since
been
troubled
with
it
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
sincerely

truth

it
seems

differ
from
all

in

respect
that

is
therefore
our
decided
opinion
that
veratria
is
a
useful

very
potent
medicine
in
certain
nervous
affections
and
that
it
deserves
to
be

review
july
i
have
often
cured
most
successfully
cases
of
of
the
face
by
sprinkling
small
blisters
made
in
the
course
of
the
affected
nerves
with
one
or
two
grains
of
veratria
and
repeating
it
every
three
or
four
days
i
use
the
same
means
and
with
equal
advantage
in
cases
of
paralysis
i
need
not
add
that
in
these
cases
the
application
should
be
made
in
the
course
of
the

edition
i
have
now
made
a
very
considerable
trial
of
the
veratria
ointment
as
an
external
application
in
gout
and
with
such
share
of
satisfaction
in
its
effects
that
i
acknowledge
myself
much
indebted
to
the
work
of
turnbull
for
the
possession
of
a
very
useful
remedy
my
conclusive
opinion
of
the
action
of
the
veratria
ointment
in
gout
is
that
we
may
consider
it
to
be
entirely
a
local
remedy
i
have
not
detected
any
constitutional
effects
to
be
produced
by
it
in
any
case
of
gout
in
which
i
have
prescribed
it
probably
the
absorbents
of
a
part
affected
with
gout
are
in
a
torpid
state
it
is
no
small
praise
of
the
application
that
it
does
not
produce
any
inconvenient
effects

the
patient
is
pleased

its

it
must
naturally
be
