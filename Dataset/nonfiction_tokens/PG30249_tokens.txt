preface
my
reader
will
find
this
volume
quite
a
departure
in
certain
ways
from
the
tone
and
spirit
of
my
previous
books
especially
in
regard
to
the
subject
of
animal
intelligence
heretofore
i
have
made
the
most
of
every
gleam
of
intelligence
of
bird
or
beast
that
came
under
my
observation
often
i
fancy
making
too
much
of
it
and
giving
the
wild
creatures
credit
for
more
sense
than
they
really
possessed
the
nature
lover
is
always
tempted
to
do
this
very
thing
his
tendency
is
to
humanize
the
wild
life
about
him
and
to
read
his
own
traits
and
moods
into
whatever
he
looks
upon
i
have
never
consciously
done
this
myself
at
least
to
the
extent
of
willfully
misleading
my
reader
but
some
of
our
later
nature
writers
have
been
guilty
of
this
fault
and
have
so
grossly
exaggerated
and
misrepresented
the
wild
life
of
our
fields
and
woods
that
their
example
has
caused
a
strong
reaction
to
take
place
in
my
own
mind
and
has
led
me
to
set
about
examining
the
whole
subject
of
animal
life
and
instinct
in
a
way
i
have
never
done
before
in
march
i
contributed
to
the
atlantic
monthly
a
paper
called
real
and
sham
natural
history
which
was
as
vigorous
a
protest
as
i
could
make
against
the
growing
tendency
to
humanize
the
lower
animals
the
paper
was
widely
read
and
discussed
and
bore
fruit
in
many
ways
much
of
it
good
and
wholesome
fruit
but
a
little
of
it
bitter
and
acrid
for
obvious
reasons
that
paper
is
not
included
in
this
collection
but
i
have
given
all
the
essays
that
were
the
outcome
of
the
currents
of
thought
and
inquiry
that
it
set
going
in
my
mind
and
i
have
given
them
nearly
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
written
so
that
the
reader
may
see
the
growth
of
my
own
mind
and
opinions
in
relation
to
the
subject
i
confess
i
have
not
been
fully
able
to
persuade
myself
that
the
lower
animals
ever
show
anything
more
than
a
faint
gleam
of
what
we
call
thought
and
reflection
the
power
to
evolve
ideas
from
sense
impressions
except
feebly
in
the
case
of
the
dog
and
the
apes
and
possibly
the
elephant
nearly
all
the
animal
behavior
that
the
credulous
public
looks
upon
as
the
outcome
of
reason
is
simply
the
result
of
the
adaptiveness
and
plasticity
of
instinct
the
animal
has
impulses
and
impressions
where
we
have
ideas
and
concepts
of
our
faculties
i
concede
to
them
perception
sense
memory
and
association
of
memories
and
little
else
without
these
it
would
be
impossible
for
their
lives
to
go
on
i
am
aware
that
there
is
much
repetition
in
this
volume
and
that
the
names
of
several
of
the
separate
chapters
differ
much
more
than
do
the
subjects
discussed
in
them
when
i
was
a
boy
on
the
farm
we
used
to
thrash
our
grain
with
the
our
custom
was
to
thrash
a
flooring
of
sheaves
on
one
side
then
turn
the
sheaves
over
and
thrash
them
on
the
other
then
unbind
them
and
thrash
the
loosened
straw
again
and
then
finish
by
turning
the
whole
over
and
thrashing
it
once
more
i
suspect
my
reader
will
feel
that
i
have
followed
the
same
method
in
many
of
these
papers
i
have
thrashed
the
same
straw
several
times
but
i
have
turned
it
each
time
and
i
trust
have
been
rewarded
by
a
few
additional
grains
of
truth
let
me
hope
that
the
result
of
the
discussion
or
thrashing
will
not
be
to
make
the
reader
love
the
animals
less
but
rather
to
love
the
truth

ways

i
was
much
amused
lately
by
a
or
more
letters
that
came
to
me
from
some
californian
schoolchildren
who
wrote
to
ask
if
i
would
please
tell
them
whether
or
not
birds
have
sense
one
little
girl
said
i
would
be
pleased
if
you
would
write
and
tell
me
if
birds
have
sense
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
be
the
first
one
to
know
i
felt
obliged
to
reply
to
the
children
that
we
ourselves
do
not
have
sense
enough
to
know
just
how
much
sense
the
birds
and
other
wild
creatures
do
have
and
that
they
do
appear
to
have
some
though
their
actions
are
probably
the
result
of
what
we
call
instinct
or
natural
prompting
like
that
of
the
when
it
climbs
the
pole
yet
a
will
sometimes
show
a
kind
of
perversity
or
depravity
that
looks
like
the
result
of
deliberate
choice
each
season
among
my
dozen
or
more
hills
of
there
are
usually
two
or
three
plants
that
will
not
climb
the
poles
but
go
groveling
upon
the
ground
wandering
off
among
the
or
cucumbers
departing
utterly
from
the
traditions
of
their
race
becoming
shiftless
and
vagrant
when
i
lift
them
up
and
wind
them
around
the
poles
and
tie
them
with
a
wisp
of
grass
they
rarely
stay
in
some
way
they
seem
to
get
a
wrong
start
in
life
or
else
are
degenerates
from
the
first
i
have
never
known
anything
like
this
among
the
wild
creatures
though
it
happens
often
enough
among
our
own
kind
the
trouble
with
the
bean
is
doubtless
this
the
lima
bean
is
of
south
american
origin
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
beans
it
seems
go
the
other
way
around
the
pole
that
is
from
right
to
left
when
transferred
north
of
the
equator
it
takes
them
some
time
to
learn
the
new
way
or
from
left
to
right
and
a
few
of
them
are
always
backsliding
or
departing
from
the
new
way
and
vaguely
seeking
the
old
and
not
finding
this
they
become
vagabonds
how
much
or
how
little
sense
or
judgment
our
wild
neighbors
have
is
hard
to
determine
the
crows
and
other
birds
that
carry
high
in
the
air
and
then
let
them
drop
upon
the
rocks
to
break
the
shell
show
something
very
much
like
reason
or
a
knowledge
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
though
it
is
probably
an
unthinking
habit
formed
in
their
ancestors
under
the
pressure
of
hunger
froude
tells
of
some
species
of
bird
that
he
saw
in
south
africa
flying
amid
the
swarm
of
migrating
locusts
and
clipping
off
the
wings
of
the
insects
so
that
they
would
drop
to
the
earth
where
the
birds
could
devour
them
at
their
leisure
our
squirrels
will
cut
off
the
chestnut
burs
before
they
have
opened
allowing
them
to
fall
to
the
ground
where
as
they
seem
to
know
the
burs
soon
dry
open
feed
a
caged
coon
soiled
food
a
piece
of
bread
or
meat
rolled
on
the
ground
and
before
he
eats
it
he
will
put
it
in
his
dish
of
water
and
wash
it
off
the
author
of
wild
life
near
home
says
that
muskrats
will
wash
what
they
eat
whether
washing
is
needed
or
not
if
the
coon
washes
his
food
only
when
it
needs
washing
and
not
in
every
individual
instance
then
the
proceeding
looks
like
an
act
of
judgment
the
same
with
the
muskrat
but
if
they
always
wash
their
food
whether
soiled
or
not
the
act
looks
more
like
instinct
or
an
inherited
habit
the
origin
of
which
is
obscure
birds
and
animals
probably
think
without
knowing
that
they
think
that
is
they
have
not
only
man
seems
to
be
endowed
with
this
faculty
he
alone
develops
disinterested
intelligence
intelligence
that
is
not
primarily
concerned
with
his
own
safety
and
but
that
looks
abroad
upon
things
the
wit
of
the
lower
animals
seems
all
to
have
been
developed
by
the
struggle
for
existence
and
it
rarely
gets
beyond
the
prudential
stage
the
sharper
the
struggle
the
sharper
the
wit
our
porcupine
for
instance
is
probably
the
most
stupid
of
animals
and
has
the
least
speed
it
has
little
use
for
either
wit
or
celerity
of
movement
it
carries
a
armor
to
protect
it
from
its
enemies
and
it
can
climb
the
nearest
hemlock
tree
and
live
on
the
bark
all
winter
the
skunk
too
pays
for
its
terrible
weapon
by
dull
wits
but
think
of
the
wit
of
the
fox
the
otter
the
beaver
even
the
grouse
when
often
fired
at
learns
when
it
is
started
in
the
open
to
fly
with
a
corkscrew
motion
to
avoid
the
shot
fear
love
and
hunger
were
the
agents
that
developed
the
wits
of
the
lower
animals
as
they
were
of
course
the
prime
factors
in
developing
the
intelligence
of
man
but
man
has
gone
on
while
the
animals
have
stopped
at
these
fundamental
wants
the
need
of
safety
of
offspring
of
food
probably
in
a
state
of
wild
nature
birds
never
make
mistakes
but
where
they
come
in
contact
with
our
civilization
and
are
confronted
by
new
conditions
they
very
naturally
make
mistakes
for
instance
their
cunning
in
sometimes
deserts
them
the
art
of
the
bird
is
to
conceal
its
nest
both
as
to
position
and
as
to
material
but
now
and
then
it
is
betrayed
into
weaving
into
its
structure
showy
and
bizarre
bits
of
this
or
that
which
give
its
secret
away
and
which
seem
to
violate
all
the
traditions
of
its
kind
i
have
the
picture
of
a
robin
nest
before
me
upon
the
outside
of
which
are
stuck
a
muslin
flower
a
leaf
from
a
small
calendar
and
a
photograph
of
a
local
celebrity
a
more
incongruous
use
of
material
in
bird
architecture
it
would
be
hard
to
find
i
have
been
told
of
another
robin
nest
upon
the
outside
of
which
the
bird
had
fastened
a
wooden
label
from
a
marked
wake
robin
still
another
nest
i
have
seen
built
upon
a
large
showy
foundation
of
the
flowers
of
antennaria
or
everlasting
the
wood
thrush
frequently
weaves
a
fragment
of
newspaper
or
a
white
rag
into
the
foundation
of
its
nest
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners
the
newspaper
and
the
unsettle
the
wits
of
the
birds
the
is
capable
of
this
kind
of
mistake
or
indiscretion
all
the
past
generations
of
her
tribe
have
built
upon
natural
and
therefore
neutral
sites
usually
under
shelving
and
overhanging
rocks
and
the
art
of
adapting
the
nest
to
its
surroundings
blending
it
with
them
has
been
highly
developed
but
phoebe
now
frequently
builds
under
our
sheds
and
porches
where
so
far
as
concealment
is
concerned
a
change
of
material
say
from
moss
to
dry
grass
or
shreds
of
bark
would
be
an
advantage
to
her
but
she
departs
not
a
bit
from
the
family
traditions
she
uses
the
same
woodsy
mosses
which
in
some
cases
especially
when
the
nest
is
placed
upon
newly
sawed
timber
make
her
secret
an
open
one
to
all
eyes
it
does
indeed
often
look
as
if
the
birds
had
very
little
sense
think
of
a
bluebird
or
an
oriole
or
a
robin
or
a
jay
fighting
for
hours
at
a
time
its
own
image
as
reflected
in
a
pane
of
glass
quite
exhausting
itself
in
its
fury
to
demolish
its
supposed
rival
yet
i
have
often
witnessed
this
little
comedy
it
is
another
instance
of
how
the
arts
of
our
civilization
corrupt
and
confuse
the
birds
it
may
be
that
in
the
course
of
many
generations
the
knowledge
of
glass
will
get
into
their
blood
and
they
will
cease
to
be
fooled
by
it
as
they
may
also
in
time
learn
what
a
poor
foundation
the
newspaper
is
to
build
upon
the
ant
or
the
bee
could
not
be
fooled
by
the
glass
in
that
way
for
a
moment
the
birds
and
our
other
wild
neighbors
sense
as
distinguished
from
instinct
is
a
change
of
habits
to
meet
new
conditions
or
the
taking
advantage
of
accidental
circumstances
an
evidence
of
sense
how
many
birds
appear
to
have
taken
advantage
of
the
protection
afforded
by
man
in
building
their
nests
how
many
of
them
build
near
paths
and
along
roadsides
to
say
nothing
of
those
that
come
close
to
our
dwellings
even
the
quail
seems
to
prefer
the
borders
of
the
highway
to
the
open
fields
i
have
chanced
upon
only
three
nests
and
these
were
all
by
the
roadside
one
season
a
scarlet
tanager
that
had
failed
with
her
first
nest
in
the
woods
came
to
try
again
in
a
little
cherry
tree
that
stood
in
the
open
a
few
feet
from
my
cabin
where
i
could
almost
touch
the
nest
with
my
hand
as
i
passed
but
in
my
absence
she
again
came
to
grief
some
marauder
probably
a
red
squirrel
taking
her
eggs
will
her
failure
in
this
case
cause
her
to
lose
faith
in
the
protective
influence
of
the
shadow
of
a
human
dwelling
i
hope
not
i
have
known
the
turtle
dove
to
make
a
similar
move
occupying
an
old
robin
nest
near
my
cottage
the
timid
rabbit
will
sometimes
come
up
from
the
bushy
fields
and
excavate
a
place
for
her
nest
in
the
lawn
a
few
feet
from
the
house
all
such
things
look
like
acts
of
judgment
though
they
may
be
only
the
result
of
a
greater
fear
overcoming
a
lesser
fear
it
is
in
the
preservation
of
their
lives
and
of
their
young
that
the
wild
creatures
come
the
nearest
to
showing
what
we
call
sense
or
reason
the
boys
tell
me
that
a
rabbit
that
has
been
driven
from
her
hole
a
couple
of
times
by
a
ferret
will
not
again
run
into
it
when
pursued
the
tragedy
of
a
rabbit
pursued
by
a
mink
or
a
weasel
may
often
be
read
upon
our
winter
snows
the
rabbit
does
not
take
to
her
hole
it
would
be
fatal
and
yet
though
capable
of
far
greater
speed
so
far
as
i
have
observed
she
does
not
escape
the
mink
he
very
soon
pulls
her
down
it
would
look
as
though
a
fatal
paralysis
the
paralysis
of
utter
fear
fell
upon
the
poor
creature
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
hunted
by
this
subtle
bloodthirsty
enemy
i
have
seen
upon
the
snow
where
her
jumps
had
become
shorter
and
shorter
with
tufts
of
fur
marking
each
stride
till
the
bloodstains
and
then
her
body
told
the
whole
tragic
story
there
is
probably
nothing
in
human
experience
at
this
age
of
the
world
that
is
like
the
helpless
terror
that
seizes
the
rabbits
as
it
does
other
of
our
lesser
wild
creatures
when
pursued
by
any
of
the
weasel
tribe
they
seem
instantly
to
be
under
some
fatal
spell
which
binds
their
feet
and
destroys
their
will
power
it
would
seem
as
if
a
certain
phase
of
nature
from
which
we
get
our
notions
of
fate
and
cruelty
had
taken
form
in
the
weasel
the
rabbit
when
pursued
by
the
fox
or
by
the
dog
quickly
takes
to
hole
hence
perhaps
the
wit
of
the
fox
that
a
hunter
told
me
about
the
story
was
all
written
upon
the
snow
a
mink
was
hunting
a
rabbit
and
the
fox
happening
along
evidently
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
he
secreted
himself
behind
a
tree
or
a
rock
and
as
the
rabbit
came
along
swept
her
from
her
course
like
a
charge
of
shot
fired
at
close
range
hurling
her
several
feet
over
the
snow
and
then
seizing
her
and
carrying
her
to
his
den
up
the
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
long
our
chimney
swifts
saw
the
open
of
the
early
settlers
beneath
them
before
they
abandoned
the
hollow
trees
in
the
woods
and
entered
the
chimneys
for
nesting
and
roosting
purposes
was
the
act
an
act
of
judgment
or
simply
an
unreasoning
impulse
like
so
much
else
in
the
lives
of
the
wild
creatures
in
the
choice
of
the
swift
shows
no
change
of
habit
she
still
snips
off
the
small
dry
twigs
from
the
and
glues
them
together
and
to
the
side
of
the
chimney
with
her
own
glue
the
soot
is
a
new
obstacle
in
her
way
that
she
does
not
yet
seem
to
have
learned
to
overcome
as
the
rains
often
loosen
it
and
cause
her
nest
to
fall
to
the
bottom
she
has
a
pretty
way
of
trying
to
frighten
you
off
when
your
head
suddenly
darkens
the
opening
above
her
at
such
times
she
leaves
the
nest
and
clings
to
the
side
of
the
chimney
near
it
then
slowly
raising
her
wings
she
suddenly
springs
out
from
the
wall
and
back
again
making
as
loud
a
drumming
with
them
in
the
passage
as
she
is
capable
of
if
this
does
not
frighten
you
away
she
repeats
it
three
or
four
times
if
your
face
still
hovers
above
her
she
remains
quiet
and
watches
you
what
a
creature
of
the
air
this
bird
is
never
touching
the
ground
so
far
as
i
know
and
never
tasting
earthly
food
the
swallow
does
perch
now
and
then
and
descend
to
the
ground
for
but
the
swift
i
have
reason
to
believe
even
outrides
the
summer
storms
facing
them
on
steady
wing
high
in
air
the
twigs
for
her
nest
she
gathers
on
the
wing
sweeping
along
like
children
on
a
who
try
to
seize
a
ring
or
to
do
some
other
feat
as
they
pass
a
given
point
if
the
swift
misses
the
twig
or
it
fails
to
yield
to
her
the
first
time
she
tries
again
and
again
each
time
making
a
wider
circuit
as
if
to
tame
and
train
her
steed
a
little
and
bring
him
up
more
squarely
to
the
mark
next
time
the
swift
is
a
stiff
flyer
there
appear
to
be
no
joints
in
her
wings
she
suggests
something
made
of
wires
or
of
steel
yet
the
air
of
frolic
and
of
superabundance
of
is
more
marked
with
her
than
with
any
other
of
our
birds
her
feeding
and
seem
like
asides
in
a
life
of
endless
play
several
times
both
in
spring
and
fall
i
have
seen
swifts
gather
in
immense
numbers
toward
nightfall
to
take
refuge
in
large
unused
on
such
occasions
they
seem
to
be
coming
together
for
some
aerial
festival
or
grand
celebration
and
as
if
bent
upon
a
final
effort
to
work
off
a
part
of
their
superabundant
before
settling
down
for
the
night
they
circle
and
circle
high
above
the
a
great
cloud
of
them
drifting
this
way
and
that
all
in
high
spirits
and
chippering
as
they
fly
their
numbers
constantly
increase
as
other
members
of
the
clan
come
dashing
in
from
all
points
of
the
compass
swifts
seem
to
materialize
out
of
empty
air
on
all
sides
of
the
chippering
whirling
ring
as
an
hour
or
more
this
assembling
of
the
clan
and
this
flight
festival
go
on
the
birds
must
gather
in
from
whole
counties
or
from
half
a
state
they
have
been
on
the
wing
all
day
and
yet
now
they
seem
as
tireless
as
the
wind
and
as
if
unable
to
curb
their
powers
one
fall
they
gathered
in
this
way
and
took
refuge
for
the
night
in
a
large
in
a
city
near
me
for
more
than
a
month
and
a
half
several
times
i
went
to
town
to
witness
the
spectacle
and
a
spectacle
it
was
ten
thousand
of
them
i
should
think
filling
the
air
above
a
whole
square
like
a
whirling
swarm
of
huge
black
bees
but
saluting
the
ear
with
a
multitudinous
chippering
instead
of
a
humming
people
gathered
upon
the
sidewalks
to
see
them
it
was
a
rare
circus
performance
free
to
all
after
a
great
many
feints
and
playful
approaches
the
whirling
ring
of
birds
would
suddenly
grow
denser
above
the
chimney
then
a
stream
of
them
as
if
drawn
down
by
some
power
of
suction
would
pour
into
the
opening
for
only
a
few
seconds
would
this
downward
rush
continue
then
as
if
the
spirit
of
frolic
had
again
got
the
upper
hand
of
them
the
ring
would
rise
and
the
chippering
and
circling
go
on
in
a
minute
or
two
the
same
manoeuvre
would
be
repeated
the
chimney
as
it
were
taking
its
swallows
at
intervals
to
prevent
choking
it
usually
took
a
or
more
for
the
birds
all
to
disappear
down
its
capacious
throat
there
was
always
an
air
of
timidity
and
irresolution
about
their
approach
to
the
chimney
just
as
there
always
is
about
their
approach
to
the
dead
from
which
they
procure
their
twigs
for
often
did
i
see
birds
hesitate
above
the
opening
and
then
pass
on
apparently
as
though
they
had
not
struck
it
at
just
the
right
angle
on
one
occasion
a
solitary
bird
was
left
flying
and
it
took
three
or
four
trials
either
to
make
up
its
mind
or
to
catch
the
trick
of
the
descent
on
dark
or
threatening
or
stormy
days
the
birds
would
begin
to
assemble
by
and
by
four
or
five
were
all
in
their
lodgings
the
chimney
is
a
capacious
one
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
and
nearly
three
feet
square
yet
it
did
not
seem
adequate
to
afford
for
so
many
birds
i
was
curious
to
know
how
they
disposed
themselves
inside
at
the
bottom
was
a
small
opening
holding
my
ear
to
it
i
could
hear
a
continuous
chippering
and
humming
as
if
the
birds
were
still
all
in
motion
like
an
agitated
beehive
at
nine
this
multitudinous
sound
of
wings
and
voices
was
still
going
on
and
doubtless
it
was
kept
up
all
night
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
was
the
press
of
birds
so
great
that
they
needed
to
keep
their
wings
moving
to
ventilate
the
shaft
as
do
certain
of
the
bees
in
a
crowded
hive
or
were
these
restless
spirits
unable
to
fold
their
wings
even
in
sleep
i
was
very
curious
to
get
a
peep
inside
that
chimney
when
the
swifts
were
in
it
so
one
afternoon
this
opportunity
was
afforded
me
by
the
removal
of
the
large
of
the
old
this
left
an
opening
into
which
i
could
thrust
my
head
and
shoulders
the
sound
of
wings
and
voices
filled
the
hollow
shaft
on
looking
up
i
saw
the
sides
of
the
chimney
for
about
half
its
length
paved
with
the
restless
birds
they
sat
so
close
together
that
their
bodies
touched
moreover
a
large
number
of
them
were
constantly
on
the
wing
showing
against
the
sky
light
as
if
they
were
leaving
the
chimney
but
they
did
not
leave
it
they
rose
up
a
few
feet
and
then
resumed
their
positions
upon
the
sides
and
it
was
this
movement
that
caused
the
humming
sound
all
the
while
the
droppings
of
the
birds
came
down
like
a
summer
shower
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
was
a
mine
of
guano
three
or
four
feet
deep
with
a
dead
swift
here
and
there
upon
it
probably
one
or
more
birds
out
of
such
a
multitude
died
every
night
i
had
fancied
there
would
be
many
more
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
dawned
upon
me
what
this
uninterrupted
flight
within
the
chimney
meant
finally
i
saw
that
it
was
a
sanitary
measure
only
thus
could
the
birds
keep
from
soiling
each
other
with
their
droppings
birds
digest
very
rapidly
and
had
they
all
continued
to
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
wall
they
would
have
been
in
a
sad
predicament
before
morning
like
other
acts
of
cleanliness
on
the
part
of
birds
this
was
doubtless
the
prompting
of
instinct
and
not
of
judgment
it
was
nature
looking
out
for
her
own
in
view
then
of
the
doubtful
sense
or
intelligence
of
the
wild
creatures
what
shall
we
say
of
the
new
school
of
nature
writers
or
natural
history
romancers
that
has
lately
arisen
and
that
reads
into
the
birds
and
animals
almost
the
entire
human
psychology
this
surely
so
far
as
these
writers
awaken
an
interest
in
the
wild
denizens
of
the
field
and
wood
and
foster
a
genuine
love
of
them
in
the
hearts
of
the
young
people
so
far
is
their
influence
good
but
so
far
as
they
pervert
natural
history
and
give
false
impressions
of
the
intelligence
of
our
animals
catering
to
a
taste
that
prefers
the
fanciful
to
the
true
and
the
real
is
their
influence
bad
of
course
the
great
army
of
readers
prefer
this
natural
history
to
the
real
thing
but
the
danger
always
is
that
an
indulgence
of
this
taste
will
take
away
a
liking
for
the
real
thing
or
prevent
its
development
the
knowing
ones
those
who
can
take
these
pretty
tales
with
the
pinch
of
salt
of
real
knowledge
are
not
many
the
great
majority
are
simply
entertained
while
they
are
being
humbugged
there
may
be
no
very
serious
objection
to
the
popular
love
of
sweets
being
catered
to
in
this
field
by
serving
up
the
of
our
animals
in
a
story
all
the
missing
links
supplied
and
all
their
motives
and
acts
humanized
provided
it
is
not
done
covertly
and
under
the
guise
of
a
real
history
we
are
never
at
a
loss
how
to
take
kipling
in
his
jungle
book
we
are
pretty
sure
that
this
is
fact
dressed
up
as
fiction
and
that
much
of
the
real
life
of
the
jungle
is
in
these
stories
i
remember
reading
his
story
of
the
white
seal
shortly
after
i
had
visited
the
seal
islands
in
bering
sea
and
i
could
not
detect
in
the
story
one
departure
from
the
facts
of
the
of
the
seal
so
far
as
it
is
known
kipling
takes
no
covert
liberties
with
natural
history
any
more
than
he
does
with
the
facts
of
human
history
in
his
novels
unadulterated
unsweetened
observations
are
what
the
real
craves
no
man
can
invent
incidents
and
traits
as
interesting
as
the
reality
then
to
know
that
a
thing
is
true
gives
it
such
a
savor
the
truth
how
we
do
crave
the
truth
we
can
not
feed
our
minds
on
simulacra
any
more
than
we
can
our
bodies
do
assure
us
that
the
thing
you
tell
is
true
if
you
must
counterfeit
the
truth
do
it
so
deftly
that
we
shall
never
detect
you
but
in
natural
history
there
is
no
need
to
counterfeit
the
truth
the
reality
always
suffices
if
you
have
eyes
to
see
it
and
ears
to
hear
it
behold
what
maeterlinck
makes
out
of
the
life
of
the
bee
simply
by
getting
at
and
portraying
the
facts
a
true
the
enchantment
of
poetry
wedded
to
the
authority
of
science
works
on
animal
intelligence
such
as
romanes
abound
in
incidents
that
show
in
the
animals
reason
and
forethought
in
their
simpler
forms
but
in
many
cases
the
incidents
related
in
these
works
are
not
well
authenticated
nor
told
by
trained
observers
the
observations
of
the
great
majority
of
people
have
no
scientific
value
whatever
romanes
quotes
from
some
person
who
alleges
that
he
saw
a
pair
of
nightingales
during
a
flood
in
the
river
near
which
their
nest
was
placed
pick
up
the
nest
bodily
and
carry
it
to
a
place
of
safety
this
is
incredible
if
romanes
himself
or
darwin
himself
said
he
saw
this
one
would
have
to
believe
it
birds
whose
nests
have
been
plundered
sometimes
pull
the
old
nest
to
pieces
and
use
the
material
or
parts
of
it
in
building
a
new
nest
but
i
can
not
believe
that
any
pair
of
birds
ever
picked
up
a
nest
containing
eggs
and
carried
it
off
to
a
new
place
how
could
they
do
it
with
one
on
each
side
how
could
they
fly
with
the
nest
between
them
they
could
not
carry
it
with
their
feet
and
how
could
they
manage
it
with
their
beaks
my
neighbor
met
in
the
woods
a
black
snake
that
had
just
swallowed
a
red
squirrel
now
your
may
take
such
a
fact
as
this
and
make
as
pretty
a
story
of
it
as
he
can
he
may
ascribe
to
the
snake
and
his
victim
all
the
human
emotions
he
pleases
he
may
make
the
snake
glide
through
the
from
limb
to
limb
and
from
tree
to
tree
in
pursuit
of
its
prey
the
main
thing
is
the
snake
got
the
squirrel
if
our
romancer
makes
the
snake
fascinate
the
squirrel
i
shall
object
because
i
do
believe
that
snakes
have
this
power
people
like
to
believe
that
they
have
it
would
seem
as
if
this
subtle
gliding
hateful
creature
ought
to
have
some
such
mysterious
gift
but
i
have
no
proof
that
it
has
every
year
i
see
the
black
snake
robbing
or
pursued
by
birds
whose
nests
it
has
just
plundered
but
i
have
yet
to
see
it
cast
its
fatal
spell
upon
a
grown
bird
or
if
our
romancer
says
that
the
black
snake
was
drilled
in
the
art
of
by
its
mother
i
shall
know
he
is
a
pretender
speaking
of
snakes
reminds
me
of
an
incident
i
have
several
times
witnessed
in
our
woods
in
connection
with
a
snake
commonly
called
the
sissing
or
blowing
adder
when
i
have
teased
this
snake
a
few
moments
with
my
cane
it
seems
to
be
seized
with
an
epileptic
or
cataleptic
fit
it
throws
itself
upon
its
back
coiled
nearly
in
the
form
of
a
figure
eight
and
begins
a
series
of
writhings
and
twistings
and
convulsive
movements
astonishing
to
behold
its
mouth
is
open
and
presently
full
of
its
eyes
are
covered
with
the
same
its
head
is
thrown
back
its
white
belly
up
now
it
is
under
the
leaves
now
out
the
body
all
the
while
being
rapidly
drawn
through
this
figure
eight
so
that
the
head
and
tail
are
constantly
changing
place
what
does
it
mean
is
it
fear
is
it
a
real
fit
i
do
not
know
but
any
one
of
our
could
tell
you
at
once
i
can
only
suggest
that
it
may
be
a
ruse
to
baffle
its
enemy
the
black
snake
when
he
would
attempt
to
crush
it
in
his
folds
or
to
seize
its
head
when
he
would
swallow
it
i
am
reminded
of
another
mystery
connected
with
a
snake
or
a
and
a
bird
why
does
our
great
crested
flycatcher
weave
a
into
its
nest
or
in
lieu
of
that
something
that
suggests
a
such
as
an
or
or
a
bit
of
oiled
paper
it
is
thought
by
some
persons
that
it
uses
the
as
a
kind
of
scarecrow
to
frighten
away
its
natural
enemies
but
think
what
this
purpose
in
the
use
of
it
would
imply
it
would
imply
that
the
bird
knew
that
there
were
among
its
enemies
creatures
that
were
afraid
of
snakes
so
afraid
of
them
that
one
of
their
faded
and
skins
would
keep
these
enemies
away
how
could
the
bird
obtain
this
knowledge
it
is
not
afraid
of
the
skin
itself
why
should
it
infer
that
squirrels
for
instance
are
i
am
convinced
there
is
nothing
in
this
notion
in
all
the
nests
that
have
come
under
my
observation
the
was
in
faded
fragments
woven
into
the
texture
of
the
nest
and
one
would
not
be
aware
of
its
presence
unless
he
pulled
the
nest
to
pieces

a
nest
of
this

whole
coiled
around

but
it
was
the
skin
of

small
six
or
seven
inches
long
and
could
not
therefore
have
inspired
much
terror
in
the
heart

tells
me
he
has
seen
a
whole
skin
dangling
nearly
its
entire
length
from
the
hole
that
contained
the
nest
just
as
he
has
seen
strings
hanging
from
the
nest
of
the
kingbird
the
bird
was
too
hurried
or
too
careless
to
pull
in
the
skin
sharp
adds
that
he
can
not
give
the
bird
credit
for
appreciating
the
attitude
of
the
rest
of
the
world
toward
snakes
and
making
use
of
the
fear
moreover
a
looks
very
little
like
a
snake
it
is
thin
shrunken
faded
papery
and
there
is
no
terror
in
it
then
too
it
is
dark
in
the
cavity
of
the
nest
consequently
the
skin
could
not
serve
as
a
scarecrow
in
any
case
hence
whatever
its
purpose
may
be
it
surely
is
not
that
it
looks
like
a
mere
fancy
or
whim
of
the
bird
there
is
that
in
its
voice
and
ways
that
suggests
something
a
little
uncanny
its
call
is
more
like
the
call
of
the
toad
than
that
of
a
bird
if
the
toad
did
not
always
swallow
its
own
skin
the
bird
would
probably
use
that
too
at
the
best
we
can
only
guess
at
the
motives
of
the
birds
and
beasts
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
they
nearly
all
have
reference
in
some
way
to
the
of
these
creatures
but
how
the
bits
of
an
old
in
a
bird
nest
can
contribute
specially
to
this
end
i
can
not
see
nature
is
not
always
consistent
she
does
not
always
choose
the
best
means
to
a
given
end
for
instance
all
the
wrens
except
our
house
wren
seem
to
use
about
the
best
material
at
hand
for
their
nests
what
can
be
more
unsuitable
untractable
for
a
nest
in
a
hole
or
cavity
than
the
twigs
the
house
wren
uses
dry
grasses
or
bits
of
soft
bark
would
bend
and
adapt
themselves
easily
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
but
stiff
unyielding
twigs
what
a
contrast
to
the
suitableness
of
the
material
the
hummingbird
uses
the
down
of
some
plant
which
seems
to
have
a
poetic
fitness
yesterday
in
my
walk
i
saw
where
a
red
squirrel
had
stripped
the
soft
outer
bark
off
a
group
of
red
cedars
to
build
its
winter
nest
with
this
also
seemed
fit
fit
that
such
a
creature
of
the
trees
should
not
go
to
the
ground
for
its
and
should
choose
something
soft
and
pliable
among
the
birches
it
probably
gathers
the
fine
curling
shreds
of
the
birch
bark
beside
my
path
in
the
woods
a
downy
woodpecker
late
one
fall
drilled
a
hole
in
the
top
of
a
small
dead
black
birch
for
his
winter
quarters
my
attention
was
first
called
to
his
doings
by
the
white
chips
upon
the
ground
every
day
as
i
passed
i
would
rap
upon
his
tree
and
if
he
was
in
he
would
appear
at
his
door
and
ask
plainly
enough
what
i
wanted
now
one
day
when
i
rapped
something
else
appeared
at
the
door
i
could
not
make
out
what
i
continued
my
rapping
when
out
came
two
on
the
tree
being
given
a
vigorous
shake
it
broke
off
at
the
hole
and
the
squirrels
went
sliding
down
the
air
to
the
foot
of
a
hemlock
up
which
they
disappeared
they
had
dispossessed
downy
of
his
house
had
carried
in
some
grass
and
leaves
for
a
nest
and
were
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
downy
drilled
another
cell
in
a
dead
oak
farther
up
the
hill
and
i
hope
passed
the
winter
there
unmolested
such
incidents
comic
or
tragic
as
they
chance
to
strike
us
are
happening
all
about
us
if
we
have
eyes
to
see
them
the
next
season
near
sundown
of
a
late
november
day
i
saw
downy
trying
to
get
possession
of
a
hole
not
his
own
i
chanced
to
be
passing
under
a
maple
when
white
chips
upon
the
ground
again
caused
me
to
scrutinize
the
branches
overhead
just
then
i
saw
downy
come
to
the
tree
and
hopping
around
on
the
under
side
of
a
large
dry
limb
begin
to
make
passes
at
something
with
his
beak
presently
i
made
out
a
round
hole
there
with
something
in
it
returning
downy
thrusts
the
sparring
continued
some
moments
downy
would
hop
away
a
few
feet
then
return
to
the
attack
each
time
to
be
met
by
the
occupant
of
the
hole
i
suspected
an
english
sparrow
had
taken
possession
of
cell
in
his
absence
during
the
day
but
i
was
wrong
downy
flew
to
another
branch
and
i
tossed
up
a
stone
against
the
one
that
contained
the
hole
when
with
a
sharp
steely
note
out
came
a
hairy
woodpecker
and
alighted
on
a
branch
downy
then
had
the
cheek
to
try
to
turn
his
large
rival
out
of
doors
and
it
was
hairy
cell
too
one
could
see
that
by
the
size
of
the
entrance
thus
loosely
does
the
rule
of
and
obtain
in
the
woods
there
is
no
moral
code
in
nature
might
reads
right
man
in
communities
has
evolved
ethical
standards
of
conduct
but
nations
in
their
dealings
with
one
another
are
still
largely
in
a
state
of
savage
nature
and
seek
to
establish
the
right
as
dogs
do
by
the
appeal
to
battle
one
season
a
wood
duck
laid
her
eggs
in
a
cavity
in
the
top
of
a
tall
yellow
birch
near
the
spring
that
supplies
my
cabin
with
water
a
bold
climber
shinned
up
the
fifty
or
sixty
feet
of
rough
and
looked
in
upon
the
eleven
eggs
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
his
arm
in
a
cavity
over
three
feet
deep
how
would
the
mother
duck
get
her
young
up
out
of
that
well
and
down
to
the
ground
we
watched
hoping
to
see
her
in
the
act
but
we
did
not
she
may
have
done
it
at
night
or
very
early
in
the
morning
all
we
know
is
that
when
amasa
one
morning
passed
that
way
there
sat
eleven
little
tufts
of
black
and
yellow
down
in
the
spring
with
the
mother
duck
near
by
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
feat
of
getting
down
from
the
cradle
had
been
safely
effected
probably
by
the
young
clambering
up
on
the
inside
walls
of
the
cavity
and
then
tumbling
out
into
the
air
and
coming
down
gently
like
huge
snowflakes
they
are
mostly
down
and
why
should
they
not
fall
without
any
danger
to
life
or
limb
the
notion
that
the
mother
duck
takes
the
young
one
by
one
in
her
beak
and
carries
them
to
the
creek
is
doubtless
erroneous
william
brewster
once
saw
the
whose
habits
of
nesting
are
like
those
of
the
wood
duck
get
its
young
from
the
nest
to
the
water
in
this
manner
the
mother
bird
alighted
in
the
water
under
the
nest
looked
all
around
to
see
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
then
gave
a
peculiar
call
instantly
the
young
shot
out
of
the
cavity
that
held
them
as
if
the
tree
had
taken
an
emetic
and
came
softly
down
to
the
water
beside
their
mother
another
observer
assures
me
that
he
once
found
a
newly
hatched
duckling
hung
by
the
neck
in
the
fork
of
a
bush
under
a
tree
in
which
a
brood
of
wood
ducks
had
been
hatched
the
ways
of
nature
who
can
map
them
or
fathom
them
or
interpret
them
or
do
much
more
than
read
a
hint
correctly
here
and
there
of
one
thing
we
may
be
pretty
certain
namely
that
the
ways
of
wild
nature
may
be
studied
in
our
human
ways
inasmuch
as
the
latter
are
an
evolution
from
the
former
till
we
come
to
the
ethical
code
to
altruism
and
here
we
seem
to
breathe
another
air
though
probably
this
code
differs
no
more
from
the
animal
standards
of
conduct
than
our
physical
atmosphere
differs
from
that
of
early
geologic
time
our
moral
code
must
in
some
way
have
been
evolved
from
our
rude
animal
instincts
it
came
from
within
its
possibilities
were
all
in
nature
if
not
where
were
they
i
have
seen
disinterested
acts
among
the
birds
or
what
looked
like
such
as
when
one
bird
feeds
the
young
of
another
species
when
it
hears
them
crying
for
food
but
that
a
bird
would
feed
a
grown
bird
of
another
species
or
even
of
its
own
to
keep
it
from
starving
i
have
my
doubts
i
am
quite
positive
that
mice
will
try
to
pull
one
of
their
fellows
out
of
a
trap
but
what
the
motive
is
who
shall
say
would
the
same
mice
share
their
last
crumb
with
their
fellow
if
he
were
starving
that
of
course
would
be
a
much
nearer
approach
to
the
human
code
and
is
too
much
to
expect
bees
will
clear
their
fellows
of
honey
but
whether
it
be
to
help
them
or
to
save
the
honey
is
a
question
in
my
youth
i
saw
a
parent
weasel
seize
one
of
its
nearly
grown
young
which
i
had
wounded
and
carry
it
across
an
open
barway
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
hinder
it
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
careful
observer
says
he
once
wounded
a
shrike
so
that
it
fell
to
the
ground
but
before
he
got
to
it
it
recovered
itself
and
flew
with
difficulty
toward
some
near
trees
calling
to
its
mate
the
while
the
mate
came
and
seemed
to
get
beneath
the
wounded
bird
and
buoy
it
up
so
aiding
it
that
it
gained
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
where
my
friend
left
it
but
in
neither
instance
can
we
call
this
helpfulness
entirely
disinterested
or
pure
altruism
emerson
said
that
he
was
an
endless
experimenter
with
no
past
at
his
back
this
is
just
what
nature
is
she
experiments
endlessly
seeking
new
ways
new
modes
new
forms
and
is
ever
intent
upon
breaking
away
from
the
past
in
this
way
as
darwin
showed
she
attains
to
new
species
she
is
blind
she
gropes
her
way
she
trusts
to
luck
all
her
successes
are
chance
hits
whenever
i
look
over
my
right
shoulder
as
i
sit
at
my
desk
writing
these
sentences
i
see
a
long
shoot
of
a
honeysuckle
that
came
in
through
a
crack
of
my
imperfectly
closed
window
last
summer
it
came
in
looking
or
rather
feeling
for
something
to
cling
to
it
first
dropped
down
upon
a
pile
of
books
then
reached
off
till
it
struck
the
of
another
large
window
along
this
it
crept
its
regular
leaves
standing
up
like
so
many
pairs
of
green
ears
looking
very
pretty
coming
to
the
end
of
the
open
way
there
it
turned
to
the
left
and
reached
out
into
vacancy
till
it
struck
another
running
at
right
angles
to
the
former
along
this
it
traveled
nearly
half
an
inch
a
day
till
it
came
to
the
end
of
that
road
then
it
ventured
out
into
vacant
space
again
and
pointed
straight
toward
me
at
my
desk
ten
feet
distant
day
by
day
it
kept
its
seat
upon
the
and
stretched
out
farther
and
farther
almost
beckoning
me
to
give
it
a
lift
or
to
bring
it
support
i
could
hardly
resist
its
patient
daily
appeal
late
in
october
it
had
bridged
about
three
feet
of
the
distance
that
separated
us
when
one
day
the
moment
came
when
it
could
maintain
itself
outright
in
the
air
no
longer
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
poor
thing
i
said
your
faith
was
blind
but
it
was
real
you
knew
there
was
a
support
somewhere
and
you
tried
all
ways
to
find
it
this
is
nature
she
goes
around
the
circle
she
tries
every
direction
sure
that
she
will
find
a
way
at
some
point
animals
in
cages
behave
in
a
similar
way
looking
for
a
means
of
escape
in
the
vineyard
i
see
the
reaching
out
blindly
in
all
directions
for
some
hold
for
their
tendrils
the
young
arms
seize
upon
one
another
and
tighten
their
hold
as
if
they
had
at
last
found
what
they
were
in
search
of
stop
long
enough
beside
one
of
the
vines
and
it
will
cling
to
you
and
run
all
over
you
behold
the
with
her
ball
of
dung
by
the
roadside
where
is
she
going
with
it
she
is
going
anywhere
and
everywhere
she
changes
her
direction
like
the
vine
whenever
she
encounters
an
obstacle
she
only
knows
that
somewhere
there
is
a
depression
or
a
hole
in
which
her
ball
with
its
egg
can
rest
secure
and
she
keeps
on
tumbling
about
till
she
finds
it
or
maybe
digs
one
or
comes
to
grief
by
the
foot
of
some
careless
this
again
is
nature
way
randomly
and
tirelessly
seeking
her
ends
when
we
look
over
a
large
section
of
history
we
see
that
it
is
man
way
too
or
nature
way
in
man
his
progress
has
been
a
blind
groping
the
result
of
endless
experimentation
and
all
his
failures
and
mistakes
could
not
be
written
in
a
book
how
he
has
tumbled
about
with
his
ball
seeking
the
right
place
for
it
and
how
many
times
has
he
come
to
grief
all
his
successes
have
been
lucky
hits
steam
electricity
representative
government
printing
how
long
he
groped
for
them
before
he
found
them
there
is
always
and
everywhere
the
darwinian
tendency
to
variation
to
seek
new
forms
to
improve
upon
the
past
and
man
is
under
this
law
the
same
as
is
the
rest
of
nature
one
generation
of
men
like
one
generation
of
leaves
becomes
the
fertilizer
of
the
next
failures
only
enrich
the
soil
or
make
smoother
the
way
there
are
so
many
conflicting
forces
and
interests
and
the
conditions
of
success
are
so
complex
if
the
seed
fall
here
it
will
not
germinate
if
there
it
will
be
drowned
or
washed
away
if
yonder
it
will
find
too
sharp
competition
there
are
only
a
few
places
where
it
will
find
all
the
conditions
favorable
hence
the
prodigality
of
nature
in
seeds
scattering
a
thousand
for
one
plant
or
tree
she
is
like
a
hunter
shooting
at
random
into
every
tree
or
bush
hoping
to
bring
down
his
game
which
he
does
if
his
ammunition
holds
out
long
enough
or
like
the
british
soldier
in
the
boer
war
firing
vaguely
at
an
enemy
that
he
does
not
see
but
nature
ammunition
always
holds
out
and
she
hits
her
mark
in
the
end
her
ammunition
on
our
planet
is
the
heat
of
the
sun
when
this
fails
she
will
no
longer
hit
the
mark
or
try
to
hit
it
let
there
be
a
plum
tree
anywhere
with
the
disease
called
the
upon
it
and
presently
every
plum
tree
in
its
neighborhood
will
have
black
knots
do
you
think
the
germs
from
the
first
knot
knew
where
to
find
the
other
plum
trees
no
the
wind
carried
them
in
every
direction
where
the
plum
trees
were
not
as
well
as
where
they
were
it
was
a
blind
search
and
a
chance
hit
so
with
all
seeds
and
germs
nature
covers
all
the
space
and
is
bound
to
hit
the
mark
sooner
or
later
the
sun
spills
his
light
indiscriminately
into
space
a
small
fraction
of
his
rays
hit
the
earth
and
we
are
warmed
yet
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
is
as
if
he
shone
for
us
alone
ii
i
suspect
it
requires
a
special
gift
of
grace
to
enable
one
to
hear
the
some
new
power
must
be
added
to
the
ear
or
some
obstruction
removed
there
are
not
only
scales
upon
our
eyes
so
that
we
do
not
see
there
are
scales
upon
our
ears
so
that
we
do
not
hear
a
city
woman
who
had
spent
much
of
her
time
in
the
country
once
asked
a
ornithologist
to
take
her
where
she
could
hear
the
bluebird
what
never
heard
the
bluebird
said
he
i
have
not
said
the
woman
then
you
will
never
hear
it
said
the
never
hear
it
with
that
inward
ear
that
gives
beauty
and
meaning
to
the
note
he
could
probably
have
taken
her
in
a
few
minutes
where
she
could
have
heard
the
call
or
warble
of
the
bluebird
but
it
would
have
fallen
upon
unresponsive
ears
upon
ears
that
were
not
sensitized
by
love
for
the
birds
or
associations
with
them
are
not
music
properly
speaking
but
only
suggestions
of
music
a
great
many
people
whose
attention
would
be
quickly
arrested
by
the
same
volume
of
sound
made
by
a
musical
instrument
or
by
artificial
means
never
hear
them
at
all
the
sound
of
a
boy
penny
whistle
there
in
the
grove
or
the
meadow
would
separate
itself
more
from
the
background
of
nature
and
be
a
greater
challenge
to
the
ear
than
is
the
strain
of
the
thrush
or
the
song
of
the
sparrow
there
is
something
elusive
indefinite
neutral
about
that
makes
them
strike
obliquely
as
it
were
upon
the
ear
and
we
are
very
apt
to
miss
them
they
are
a
part
of
nature
the
nature
that
lies
about
us
entirely
occupied
with
her
own
affairs
and
quite
regardless
of
our
presence
hence
it
is
with
as
it
is
with
so
many
other
things
in
nature
they
are
what
we
make
them
the
ear
that
hears
them
must
be
half
creative
i
am
always
disturbed
when
persons
not
especially
observant
of
birds
ask
me
to
take
them
where
they
can
hear
a
particular
bird
in
whose
song
they
have
become
interested
through
a
description
in
some
book
as
i
listen
with
them
i
feel
like
apologizing
for
the
bird
it
has
a
bad
cold
or
has
just
heard
some
depressing
news
it
will
not
let
itself
out
the
song
seems
so
casual
and
minor
when
you
make
a
dead
set
at
it
i
have
taken
persons
to
hear
the
hermit
thrush
and
i
have
fancied
that
they
were
all
the
time
saying
to
themselves
is
that
all
but
should
one
hear
the
bird
in
his
walk
when
the
mind
is
attuned
to
simple
things
and
is
open
and
receptive
when
expectation
is
not
aroused
and
the
song
comes
as
a
surprise
out
of
the
dusky
silence
of
the
woods
then
one
feels
that
it
merits
all
the
fine
things
that
can
be
said
of
it
one
of
our
popular
writers
and
lecturers
upon
birds
told
me
this
incident
he
had
engaged
to
take
two
city
girls
out
for
a
walk
in
the
country
to
teach
them
the
names
of
the
birds
they
might
see
and
hear
before
they
started
he
read
to
them
henry
van
dyke
poem
on
the
song
sparrow
one
of
our
best
telling
them
that
the
song
sparrow
was
one
of
the
first
birds
they
were
likely
to
hear
as
they
proceeded
with
their
walk
sure
enough
there
by
the
roadside
was
a
sparrow
in
song
the
bird
man
called
the
attention
of
his
companions
to
it
it
was
some
time
before
the
unpracticed
ears
of
the
girls
could
make
it
out
then
one
of
them
said
the
poem
she
had
just
heard
i
suppose
still
ringing
in
her
ears
what
that
little
squeaky
thing
the
sparrow
song
meant
nothing
to
her
at
all
and
how
could
she
share
the
enthusiasm
of
the
poet
probably
the
warble
of
the
robin
or
the
call
of
the
meadowlark
or
of
the
highhole
if
they
chanced
to
hear
them
meant
no
more
to
these
girls
if
we
have
no
associations
with
these
sounds
they
will
mean
very
little
to
us
their
merit
as
musical
performances
is
very
slight
it
is
as
signs
of
joy
and
love
in
nature
as
heralds
of
spring
and
as
the
spirit
of
the
woods
and
fields
made
audible
that
they
appeal
to
us
the
drumming
of
the
woodpeckers
and
of
the
ruffed
grouse
give
great
pleasure
to
a
countryman
though
these
sounds
have
not
the
quality
of
real
music
it
is
the
same
with
the
call
of
the
migrating
geese
or
the
voice
of
any
wild
thing
our
pleasure
in
them
is
entirely
apart
from
any
considerations
of
music
why
does
the
wild
flower
as
we
chance
upon
it
in
the
woods
or
bogs
give
us
more
pleasure
than
the
more
elaborate
flower
of
the
garden
or
lawn
because
it
comes
as
a
surprise
offers
a
greater
contrast
with
its
surroundings
and
suggests
a
spirit
in
wild
nature
that
seems
to
take
thought
of
itself
and
to
aspire
to
beautiful
forms
the
songs
of
caged
birds
are
always
disappointing
because
such
birds
have
nothing
but
their
musical
qualities
to
recommend
them
to
us
we
have
separated
them
from
that
which
gives
quality
and
meaning
to
their
songs
one
recalls
emerson
lines
i
thought
the
sparrow
note
from
heaven
singing
at
dawn
on
the
alder
bough
i
brought
him
home
in
his
nest
at
even
he
sings
the
song
but
it
cheers
not
now
for
i
did
not
bring
home
the
river
and
sky
he
sang
to
my
ear
they
sang
to
my
eye
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
caged
bird
that
i
wanted
at
least
not
on
account
of
its
song
nor
a
wild
flower
that
i
wished
to
transfer
to
my
garden
a
caged
skylark
will
sing
its
song
sitting
on
a
bit
of
turf
in
the
bottom
of
the
cage
but
you
want
to
stop
your
ears
it
is
so
harsh
and
sibilant
and
penetrating
but
up
there
against
the
morning
sky
and
above
the
wide
expanse
of
fields
what
delight
we
have
in
it
it
is
not
the
concord
of
sweet
sounds
it
is
the
soaring
spirit
of
gladness
and
ecstasy
raining
down
upon
us
from
gate
then
if
to
the
time
and
the
place
one
could
only
add
the
association
or
hear
the
bird
through
the
vista
of
the
years
the
song
touched
with
the
magic
of
youthful
memories
one
season
a
friend
in
england
sent
me
a
score
of
skylarks
in
a
cage
i
gave
them
their
liberty
in
a
field
near
my
place
they
drifted
away
and
i
never
heard
them
or
saw
them
again
but
one
sunday
a
scotchman
from
a
neighboring
city
called
upon
me
and
declared
with
visible
excitement
that
on
his
way
along
the
road
he
had
heard
a
skylark
he
was
not
dreaming
he
knew
it
was
a
skylark
though
he
had
not
heard
one
since
he
had
left
the
banks
of
the
doon
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
more
before
what
pleasure
it
gave
him
how
much
more
the
song
meant
to
him
than
it
would
have
meant
to
me
for
the
moment
he
was
on
his
native
heath
again
then
i
told
him
about
the
larks
i
had
liberated
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
it
all
over
again
with
renewed
appreciation
many
years
ago
some
skylarks
were
liberated
on
long
island
and
they
became
established
there
and
may
now
occasionally
be
heard
in
certain
localities
one
summer
day
a
friend
of
mine
was
out
there
observing
them
a
lark
was
soaring
and
singing
in
the
sky
above
him
an
old
irishman
came
along
and
suddenly
stopped
as
if
transfixed
to
the
spot
a
look
of
mingled
delight
and
incredulity
came
into
his
face
was
he
indeed
hearing
the
bird
of
his
youth
he
took
off
his
hat
turned
his
face
skyward
and
with
moving
lips
and
streaming
eyes
stood
a
long
time
regarding
the
bird
ah
my
friend
thought
if
i
could
only
hear
that
song
with
his
ears
how
it
brought
back
his
youth
and
all
those
days
on
his
native
hills
the
power
of
over
us
is
so
much
a
matter
of
association
that
every
traveler
to
other
countries
finds
the
feathered
songsters
of
less
merit
than
those
he
left
behind
the
stranger
does
not
hear
the
birds
in
the
same
receptive
uncritical
frame
of
mind
as
does
the
native
they
are
not
in
the
same
way
the
voices
of
the
place
and
the
season
what
music
can
there
be
in
that
long
piercing
note
of
the
first
meadowlark
in
spring
to
any
but
a
native
or
in
the
of
the
starling
as
he
rests
upon
the
willows
in
march
a
stranger
would
probably
recognize
melody
and
a
wild
woodsy
quality
in
the
flutings
of
the
veery
thrush
but
how
much
more
they
would
mean
to
him
after
he
had
spent
many
successive
junes
threading
our
northern
and
encamping
on
their
banks
the
veery
will
come
early
in
the
morning
and
again
at
sundown
and
perch
above
your
tent
and
blow
his
soft
reverberant
note
for
many
minutes
at
a
time
the
strain
repeats
the
echoes
of
the
limpid
stream
in
the
halls
and
corridors
of
the
leafy
woods
while
in
england
in
i
rushed
about
two
or
three
counties
in
late
june
and
early
july
bent
on
hearing
the
song
of
the
nightingale
but
missed
it
by
a
few
days
and
in
some
cases
as
it
seemed
only
by
a
few
hours
the
nightingale
seems
to
be
wound
up
to
go
only
so
long
or
till
about
the
middle
of
june
and
it
is
only
by
a
rare
chance
that
you
hear
one
after
that
date
then
i
came
home
to
hear
a
nightingale
in
song
one
winter
morning
in
a
friend
house
in
the
city
it
was
a
curious
to
my
enthusiasm
a
caged
song
in
a
city
chamber
in
broad
daylight
in
lieu
of
the
wild
free
song
in
the
gloaming
of
an
english
landscape
i
closed
my
eyes
abstracted
myself
from
my
surroundings
and
tried
my
best
to
fancy
myself
listening
to
the
strain
back
there
amid
the
scenes
i
had
haunted
about
haslemere
and
godalming
but
with
poor
success
i
suspect
the
nightingale
song
like
the
lark
needs
vista
needs
all
the
accessories
of
time
and
place
the
song
is
not
all
in
the
singing
any
more
than
the
wit
is
all
in
the
saying
it
is
in
the
occasion
the
surroundings
the
spirit
of
which
it
is
the
expression
my
friend
said
that
the
bird
did
not
fully
let
itself
out
its
song
was
a
brilliant
medley
of
notes
no
theme
that
i
could
detect
like
the
lark
song
in
this
respect
all
the
notes
of
the
field
and
forest
appeared
to
be
the
gift
of
this
bird
but
what
tone
what
accent
like
that
of
a
great
poet
nearly
every
may
i
am
seized
with
an
impulse
to
go
back
to
the
scenes
of
my
youth
and
hear
the
bobolinks
in
the
home
meadows
once
more
i
am
sure
they
sing
there
better
than
anywhere
else
they
probably
drink
nothing
but
dew
and
the
dew
distilled
in
those
high
pastoral
regions
has
surprising
virtues
it
gives
a
clear
full
vibrant
quality
to
the
birds
voices
that
i
have
never
heard
elsewhere
the
night
of
my
arrival
i
leave
my
southern
window
open
so
that
the
meadow
chorus
may
come
pouring
in
before
i
am
up
in
the
morning
how
it
does
transport
me
athwart
the
years
and
make
me
a
boy
again
sheltered
by
the
paternal
wing
on
one
occasion
the
third
morning
after
my
arrival
a
bobolink
appeared
with
a
new
note
in
his
song
the
note
sounded
like
the
word
baby
uttered
with
a
peculiar
tender
resonance
but
it
was
clearly
an
interpolation
it
did
not
belong
there
it
had
no
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
song
yet
the
bird
never
failed
to
utter
it
with
the
same
joy
and
confidence
as
the
rest
of
his
song
maybe
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
variation
that
will
in
time
result
in
an
entirely
new
bobolink
song
on
my
last
spring
visit
to
my
native
hills
my
attention
was
attracted
to
another
songster
not
seen
or
heard
there
in
my
youth
namely
the
prairie
horned
lark
flocks
of
these
birds
used
to
be
seen
in
some
of
the
northern
states
in
the
late
fall
during
their
southern
migrations
but
within
the
last
twenty
years
they
have
become
regular
summer
residents
in
the
hilly
parts
of
many
sections
of
new
york
and
new
england
they
are
genuine
skylarks
and
lack
only
the
powers
of
song
to
make
them
as
attractive
as
their
famous
cousins
of
europe
the
larks
are
when
they
perch
and
when
they
sing
from
the
turf
to
the
clouds
nothing
between
our
horned
lark
mounts
upward
on
quivering
wing
in
the
true
lark
fashion
and
spread
out
against
the
sky
at
an
altitude
of
two
or
three
hundred
feet
hovers
and
sings
the
watcher
and
listener
below
holds
him
in
his
eye
but
the
ear
catches
only
a
faint
broken
note
now
and
then
mere
splinters
as
it
were
of
the
song
of
the
skylark
the
song
of
the
latter
is
continuous
and
is
loud
and
humming
it
is
a
fountain
of
jubilant
song
up
there
in
the
sky
but
our
lark
sings
in
snatches
at
each
repetition
of
its
notes
it
dips
forward
and
downward
a
few
feet
and
then
rises
again
one
day
i
kept
my
eye
upon
one
until
it
had
repeated
its
song
one
hundred
and
three
times
then
it
closed
its
wings
and
dropped
toward
the
earth
like
a
plummet
as
does
its
european
congener
while
i
was
watching
the
bird
a
bobolink
flew
over
my
head
between
me
and
the
lark
and
poured
out
his
voluble
and
copious
strain
what
a
contrast
i
thought
between
the
voice
of
the
spluttering
lark
and
the
free
liquid
and
varied
song
of
the
bobolink
i
have
heard
of
a
curious
fact
in
the
of
these
larks
in
the
west
a
michigan
woman
once
wrote
me
that
her
brother
who
was
an
engineer
on
an
express
train
that
made
daily
trips
between
two
western
cities
reported
that
many
birds
were
struck
by
the
engine
every
day
and
killed
often
as
many
as
thirty
on
a
trip
of
sixty
miles
birds
of
many
kinds
were
killed
but
the
most
common
was
a
bird
that
went
in
flocks
the
description
of
which
answered
to
the
horned
lark
since
then
i
have
read
in
a
minnesota
newspaper
that
many
horned
larks
are
killed
by
railroad
locomotives
in
that
state
it
was
thought
that
the
birds
sat
behind
the
rails
to
get
out
of
the
wind
and
on
starting
up
in
front
of
the
advancing
train
were
struck
down
by
the
engine
the
michigan
engineer
referred
to
thought
that
the
birds
gathered
upon
the
track
to
earth
their
wings
or
else
to
pick
up
the
grain
that
leaks
out
of
the
and
sows
the
track
from
dakota
to
the
seaboard
probably
the
wind
which
they
might
have
to
face
in
getting
up
was
the
prime
cause
of
their
being
struck
one
does
not
think
of
the
locomotive
as
a
though
it
is
well
known
that
many
of
the
smaller
mammals
often
fall
beneath
it
a
very
interesting
feature
of
our
is
the
or
song
of
ecstasy
it
is
not
the
gift
of
many
of
our
birds
indeed
less
than
a
dozen
species
are
known
to
me
as
ever
singing
on
the
wing
it
seems
to
spring
from
more
intense
excitement
and
than
the
ordinary
song
delivered
from
the
perch
when
its
joy
reaches
the
point
of
rapture
the
bird
is
literally
carried
off
its
feet
and
up
it
goes
into
the
air
pouring
out
its
song
as
a
rocket
pours
out
its
sparks
the
skylark
and
the
bobolink
habitually
do
this
while
a
few
others
of
our
birds
do
it
only
on
occasions
one
summer
up
in
the
catskills
i
added
another
name
to
my
list
of
ecstatic
singers
that
of
the
vesper
sparrow
several
times
i
heard
a
new
song
in
the
air
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
bird
as
it
dropped
back
to
the
earth
my
attention
would
be
attracted
by
a
succession
of
hurried
chirping
notes
followed
by
a
brief
burst
of
song
then
by
the
vanishing
form
of
the
bird
one
day
i
was
lucky
enough
to
see
the
bird
as
it
was
rising
to
its
climax
in
the
air
and
to
identify
it
as
the
vesper
sparrow
the
burst
of
song
that
crowned
the
upward
flight
of
or
one
hundred
feet
was
brief
but
it
was
brilliant
and
striking
and
entirely
unlike
the
leisurely
chant
of
the
bird
while
upon
the
ground
it
suggested
a
lark
but
was
less
buzzing
or
humming
the
preliminary
chirping
notes
uttered
faster
and
faster
as
the
bird
mounted
in
the
air
were
like
the
trail
of
sparks
which
a
rocket
emits
before
its
grand
burst
of
color
at
the
top
of
its
flight
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
bird
is
quite
in
its
color
and
markings
having
the
two
lateral
white
quills
in
the
tail
and
it
has
the
habit
of
elevating
the
feathers
on
the
top
of
the
head
so
as
to
suggest
a
crest
the
solitary
skylark
that
i
discovered
several
years
ago
in
a
field
near
me
was
seen
on
several
occasions
paying
his
addresses
to
one
of
these
birds
but
the
was
shy
and
eluded
all
his
advances
probably
the
among
our
ordinary
birds
that
is
most
regularly
seized
with
the
fit
of
ecstasy
that
results
in
this
lyric
burst
in
the
air
as
i
described
in
my
first
book
wake
robin
over
thirty
years
ago
is
the
or
the
thrush
of
the
old
ornithologists
every
loiterer
about
the
woods
knows
this
pretty
little
bird
which
walks
along
over
the
dry
leaves
a
few
yards
from
him
moving
its
head
as
it
walks
like
a
miniature
domestic
fowl
most
birds
are
very
like
the
robin
and
as
they
run
or
hop
upon
the
ground
carry
the
head
as
if
it
were
riveted
to
the
body
not
so
the
or
the
other
birds
that
walk
as
the
or
the
quail
or
the
crow
they
move
the
head
forward
with
the
movement
of
the
feet
the
sharp
reiterated
almost
screeching
song
of
the
as
it
perches
on
a
limb
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
like
the
words
preacher
preacher
preacher
or
teacher
teacher
teacher
uttered
louder
and
louder
and
repeated
six
or
seven
times
is
also
familiar
to
most
ears
but
its
wild
ringing
rapturous
burst
of
song
in
the
air
high
above
the
is
not
so
well
known
from
a
very
prosy
tiresome
unmelodious
singer
it
is
suddenly
transformed
for
a
brief
moment
into
a
lyric
poet
of
great
power
it
is
a
great
surprise
the
bird
undergoes
a
complete
transformation
ordinarily
it
is
a
very
quiet
demure
sort
of
bird
it
walks
about
over
the
leaves
moving
its
head
like
a
little
hen
then
perches
on
a
limb
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
sends
forth
its
shrill
rather
prosy
unmusical
chant
surely
it
is
an
ordinary
bird
but
wait
till
the
inspiration
of
its
is
upon
it
what
a
change
up
it
goes
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
leaping
from
limb
to
limb
faster
and
faster
till
it
shoots
from
the
fifty
or
more
feet
into
the
air
above
them
and
bursts
into
an
ecstasy
of
song
rapid
ringing
lyrical
no
more
like
its
habitual
performance
than
a
match
is
like
a
rocket
brief
but
thrilling
emphatic
but
musical
having
reached
its
climax
of
flight
and
song
the
bird
closes
its
wings
and
drops
nearly
perpendicularly
downward
like
the
skylark
if
its
song
were
more
prolonged
it
would
rival
the
song
of
that
famous
bird
the
bird
does
this
many
times
a
day
during
early
june
but
oftenest
at
twilight
the
song
in
quality
and
general
cast
is
like
that
of
its
congener
the
which
however
i
believe
is
never
delivered
on
the
wing
from
its
habit
of
singing
at
twilight
and
from
the
swift
darting
motions
of
the
bird
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
it
we
have
solved
the
mystery
of
thoreau
that
puzzled
and
eluded
him
for
years
emerson
told
him
he
must
beware
of
finding
and
booking
it
lest
life
should
have
nothing
more
to
show
him
the
older
ornithologists
must
have
heard
this
song
many
times
but
they
never
seem
to
have
suspected
the
identity
of
the
singer
other
birds
that
sing
on
the
wing
are
the
meadowlark
goldfinch
purple
finch
maryland
and
woodcock
the
of
the
woodcock
i
have
heard
but
twice
in
my
life
the
first
time
was
in
the
evening
twilight
about
the
middle
of
april
the
bird
was
calling
in
the
dusk
yeap
yeap
or
seap
seap
from
the
ground
a
peculiar
reedy
call
then
by
and
by
it
started
upward
on
an
easy
slant
that
peculiar
whistling
of
its
wings
alone
heard
then
at
an
altitude
of
one
hundred
feet
or
more
it
began
to
float
about
in
wide
circles
and
broke
out
in
an
ecstatic
chipper
almost
a
warble
at
times
with
a
peculiar
smacking
musical
quality
then
in
a
minute
or
so
it
dropped
back
to
the
ground
again
not
straight
down
like
the
lark
but
more
spirally
and
continued
its
call
as
before
in
less
than
five
minutes
it
was
up
again
the
next
time
a
few
years
later
i
heard
the
song
in
company
with
a
friend
clara
barrus
let
me
give
the
woman
impression
of
the
song
as
she
afterward
wrote
it
up
for
a
popular
journal
the
sunset
light
was
flooding
all
this
may
loveliness
of
field
and
farm
and
distant
wood
song
sparrows
were
blithely
pouring
out
happiness
by
the
throatful
peepers
were
piping
and
toads
trilling
and
we
thought
it
no
hardship
to
wait
in
such
a
place
till
the
dusk
should
gather
and
the
wary
woodcock
announce
his
presence
but
hark
while
yet
is
light
only
a
few
rods
distant
i
hear
that
welcome
seap
and
lo
a
chipper
and
a
chirr
and
past
us
he
flies
a
direct
slanting
upward
flight
somewhat
labored
his
bill
showing
long
against
the
reddened
sky
has
something
in
his
mouth
i
start
to
say
when
i
bethink
me
what
a
long
bill
he
has
around
above
us
he
flies
in
wide
ambitious
circles
the
while
we
are
enveloped
as
it
were
in
that
hurried
chippering
sound
fine
elusive
now
near
now
distant
how
rapid
is
the
flight
now
it
sounds
faster
and
faster
a
whiplash
flashed
through
the
air
said
my
friend
up
up
he
soars
till
he
becomes
lost
to
sight
at
the
instant
that
his
song
ends
in
that
last
mad
ecstasy
that
just
precedes
his
alighting
the
meadowlark
sings
in
a
level
flight
half
hovering
in
the
air
giving
voice
to
a
rapid
medley
of
notes
the
goldfinch
also
sings
in
a
level
flight
beating
the
air
slowly
with
its
wings
broadly
open
and
pouring
out
its
jubilant
ecstatic
strain
i
think
it
indulges
in
this
only
in
the
early
season
after
the
mother
bird
has
begun
sitting
the
male
circles
about
within
earshot
of
her
in
that
curious
undulating
flight
uttering
his
while
the
female
calls
back
to
him
in
the
tenderest
tones
yes
lovie
i
hear
you
the
and
the
purple
finch
when
their
happiness
becomes
too
full
and
buoyant
for
them
longer
to
control
it
launch
into
the
air
and
sing
briefly
ecstatically
in
a
tremulous
hovering
flight
the
of
these
birds
does
not
differ
essentially
from
the
song
delivered
from
the
perch
except
that
it
betrays
more
excitement
and
hence
is
a
more
complete
lyrical
rapture
the
purple
finch
is
our
finest
songster
among
the
finches
its
strain
is
so
soft
and
melodious
and
touched
with
such
a
childlike
gayety
and
plaintiveness
that
i
think
it
might
sound
well
even
in
a
cage
inside
a
room
if
the
bird
would
only
sing
with
the
same
joyous
abandonment
which
of
course
it
would
not
do
it
is
not
generally
known
that
individual
birds
of
the
same
species
show
different
degrees
of
musical
ability
this
is
often
noticed
in
caged
birds
among
which
the
principle
of
variation
seems
more
active
but
an
attentive
observer
notes
the
same
fact
in
wild
birds
occasionally
he
hears
one
that
in
powers
of
song
surpasses
all
its
fellows
i
have
heard
a
sparrow
an
oriole
and
a
wood
thrush
each
of
which
had
a
song
of
its
own
that
far
exceeded
any
other
i
stood
one
day
by
a
and
suspended
my
fishing
for
several
minutes
to
watch
a
song
sparrow
that
was
singing
on
a
dry
limb
before
me
he
had
five
distinct
songs
each
as
markedly
different
from
the
others
as
any
human
songs
which
he
repeated
one
after
the
other
he
may
have
had
a
sixth
or
a
seventh
but
he
bethought
himself
of
some
business
in
the
next
field
and
flew
away
before
he
had
exhausted
his
repertory
i
once
had
a
letter
from
robert
louis
stevenson
who
said
he
had
read
an
account
i
had
written
of
the
song
of
the
english
blackbird
he
said
i
might
as
well
talk
of
the
song
of
man
that
every
blackbird
had
its
own
song
and
then
he
told
me
of
a
remarkable
singer
he
used
to
hear
somewhere
amid
the
scottish
hills
but
his
singer
was
of
course
an
exception
blackbirds
out
of
every
probably
sing
the
same
song
with
no
appreciable
variations
but
the
may
show
extraordinary
powers
i
told
stevenson
that
his
famous
singer
had
probably
been
to
school
to
some
nightingale
on
the
continent
or
in
southern
england
i
might
have
told
him
of
the
robin
i
once
heard
here
that
sang
with
great
spirit
and
accuracy
the
song
of
the
brown
thrasher
or
of
another
that
had
the
note
of
the
interpolated
in
the
regular
robin
song
or
of
still
another
that
had
the
call
of
the
quail
in
each
case
the
bird
had
probably
heard
the
song
and
learned
it
while
very
young
in
the
trossachs
in
scotland
i
followed
a
song
thrush
about
for
a
long
time
attracted
by
its
peculiar
song
it
repeated
over
and
over
again
three
or
four
notes
of
a
air
which
it
might
have
caught
from
some
shepherd
boy
whistling
to
his
flock
or
to
his
cow
the
songless
birds
why
has
nature
denied
them
this
gift
but
they
nearly
all
have
some
musical
call
or
impulse
that
serves
them
very
well
the
quail
has
his
whistle
the
woodpecker
his
drum
the
pewee
his
plaintive
cry
the
chickadee
his
exquisitely
sweet
call
the
highhole
his
long
repeated
wick
wick
wick
one
of
the
most
welcome
sounds
of
spring
the
jay
his
musical
gurgle
the
hawk
his
scream
the
crow
his
sturdy
caw
only
one
of
our
pretty
birds
of
the
orchard
is
reduced
to
an
all
but
inaudible
note
and
that
is
the
iii
nature
with
closed
doors
december
in
our
climate
is
the
month
when
nature
finally
shuts
up
house
and
turns
the
key
she
has
been
slowly
packing
up
and
putting
away
her
things
and
closing
a
door
and
a
window
here
and
there
all
the
fall
now
she
completes
the
work
and
puts
up
the
last
bar
she
is
ready
for
winter
the
leaves
are
all
off
the
trees
except
that
here
and
there
a
beech
or
an
oak
or
a
hickory
still
clings
to
a
remnant
of
its
withered
foliage
her
streams
are
full
her
new
growths
of
wood
are
ripened
her
saps
and
juices
are
quiescent
the
muskrat
has
completed
his
house
in
the
shallow
pond
or
stream
the
beaver
in
the
northern
woods
has
completed
his
the
wild
mice
and
the
chipmunk
have
laid
up
their
winter
stores
of
nuts
and
grains
in
their
dens
in
the
ground
and
in
the
cavities
of
trees
the
woodchuck
is
rolled
up
in
his
burrow
in
the
hillside
sleeping
his
long
winter
sleep
the
coon
has
deserted
his
chamber
in
the
old
tree
and
gone
into
winter
quarters
in
his
den
in
the
rocks
the
winter
birds
have
taken
on
a
good
coat
of
fat
against
the
coming
cold
and
a
possible
scarcity
of
food
the
frogs
and
toads
are
all
in
their
hibernaculums
in
the
ground
i
saw
it
stated
the
other
day
in
a
paper
read
before
some
scientific
body
that
the
wood
frogs
retreat
two
feet
into
the
ground
beyond
the
reach
of
frost
in
two
instances
i
have
found
the
wood
frog
in
december
with
a
covering
of
less
than
two
inches
of
leaves
and
moss
it
had
buried
itself
in
the
soil
and
leaf
mould
only
to
the
depth
of
the
thickness
of
its
own
body
and
for
covering
had
only
the
ordinary
coat
of
dry
leaves
and
pine
needles
to
be
found
in
the
wood
it
was
evidently
counting
upon
the
snow
for
its
main
protection
in
one
case
i
marked
the
spot
and
returned
there
in
early
spring
to
see
how
the
frog
had
wintered
i
found
it
all
right
evidently
it
had
some
charm
against
the
cold
for
while
the
earth
around
and
beneath
it
was
yet
frozen
solid
there
was
no
frost
in
the
frog
it
was
not
a
brisk
frog
but
it
was
well
and
when
i
came
again
on
a
warm
day
a
week
later
it
had
come
forth
from
its
retreat
and
was
headed
for
the
marsh
where
in
april
with
its
kith
and
kin
it
helped
make
the
air
vocal
with
its
a
friend
of
mine
one
mild
day
late
in
december
found
a
wood
frog
sitting
upon
the
snow
in
the
woods
she
took
it
home
and
put
it
to
bed
in
the
soil
of
one
of
her
in
the
cellar
in
the
spring
she
found
it
in
good
condition
and
in
april
carried
it
back
to
the
woods
the
hyla
or
little
piping
frog
passes
the
winter
in
the
ground
like
the
wood
frog
i
have
seen
the
toad
go
into
the
ground
in
the
late
fall
it
is
an
interesting
proceeding
it
literally
elbows
its
way
into
the
soil
it
sits
on
end
and
works
and
presses
with
the
sharp
joints
of
its
folded
legs
until
it
has
sunk
itself
at
a
sufficient
depth
which
is
only
a
few
inches
beneath
the
surface
the
water
frogs
appear
to
pass
the
winter
in
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
ponds
and
marshes
the
queen
bumblebee
and
the
queen
hornet
i
think
seek
out
their
winter
quarters
in
holes
in
the
ground
in
september
while
the
drones
and
the
workers
perish
the
do
not
hibernate
they
must
have
food
all
winter
but
our
native
wild
bees
are
dormant
during
the
cold
months
and
survive
the
winter
only
in
the
person
of
the
queen
mother
in
the
spring
these
queens
set
up
housekeeping
alone
and
found
new
families
insects
in
all
stages
of
their
growth
are
creatures
of
the
warmth
the
heat
is
the
motive
power
that
makes
them
go
when
this
fails
they
are
still
the
katydids
rasp
away
in
the
fall
as
long
as
there
is
warmth
enough
to
keep
them
going
as
the
heat
fails
they
fail
till
from
the
emphatic
katy
did
it
of
august
they
dwindle
to
a
hoarse
dying
kate
kate
in
october
think
of
the
stillness
that
falls
upon
the
myriad
in
the
dry
trees
and
stumps
in
the
forest
as
the
chill
of
autumn
comes
on
all
summer
have
they
worked
incessantly
in
oak
and
hickory
and
birch
and
chestnut
and
spruce
some
of
them
making
a
sound
exactly
like
that
of
the
hand
augur
others
a
fine
snapping
and
splintering
sound
but
as
the
cold
comes
on
they
go
slower
and
slower
till
they
finally
cease
to
move
a
warm
day
starts
them
again
slowly
or
briskly
according
to
the
degree
of
heat
but
in
december
they
are
finally
stilled
for
the
season
these
creatures
like
the
big
fat
grubs
of
the
june
beetles
which
one
sometimes
finds
in
the
ground
or
in
decayed
wood
are
full
of
frost
in
winter
cut
one
of
the
big
grubs
in
two
and
it
looks
like
a
lump
of
ice
cream
some
time
in
october
the
crows
begin
to
collect
together
in
large
flocks
and
establish
their
winter
quarters
they
choose
some
secluded
wood
for
a
and
thither
all
the
crows
for
many
square
miles
of
country
betake
themselves
at
night
and
thence
they
disperse
in
all
directions
again
in
the
early
morning
the
crow
is
a
social
bird
a
true
american
no
hermit
or
recluse
is
he
the
winter
probably
brings
them
together
in
these
large
colonies
for
purposes
of
sociability
and
for
greater
warmth
by
roosting
close
together
and
quite
filling
a
there
must
result
some
economy
of
heat
i
have
seen
it
stated
in
a
rhetorical
flight
of
some
writer
that
the
new
buds
crowd
the
old
leaves
off
but
this
is
not
true
as
a
rule
the
new
bud
is
formed
in
the
axil
of
the
old
leaf
long
before
the
leaves
are
ready
to
fall
with
only
two
species
of
our
trees
known
to
me
might
the
swelling
bud
push
off
the
old
leaf
in
the
sumach
and
or
the
new
bud
is
formed
immediately
under
the
base
of
the
old
by
which
it
is
covered
like
a
cap
examine
the
fallen
leaves
of
these
trees
and
you
will
see
the
cavity
in
the
base
of
each
where
the
new
bud
was
cradled
why
the
beech
the
oak
and
the
hickory
cling
to
their
old
leaves
is
not
clear
it
may
be
simply
a
slovenly
trait
inability
to
finish
and
have
done
with
a
thing
a
fault
of
so
many
people
some
oaks
and
beeches
appear
to
lack
decision
of
character
it
requires
strength
and
vitality
it
seems
simply
to
let
go
kill
a
tree
suddenly
and
the
leaves
wither
upon
the
branches
how
neatly
and
thoroughly
the
maples
the
ashes
the
birches
the
elm
clean
up
they
are
tidy
energetic
trees
and
can
turn
over
a
new
leaf
without
hesitation
a
correspondent
writing
to
me
from
one
of
the
colleges
suggests
that
our
spring
really
begins
in
december
because
the
annual
cycle
of
vegetable
life
seems
to
start
then
at
this
time
he
finds
that
many
of
our
wild
flowers
the
bloodroot
hepatica
columbine
shinleaf
maidenhair
fern
have
all
made
quite
a
start
toward
the
next
season
growth
in
some
cases
the
new
shoot
being
an
inch
high
but
the
real
start
of
the
next
season
vegetable
life
in
this
sense
is
long
before
december
it
is
in
late
summer
when
the
new
buds
are
formed
on
the
trees
nature
looks
ahead
and
makes
ready
for
the
new
season
in
the
midst
of
the
old
cut
open
the
terminal
hickory
buds
in
the
late
fall
and
you
will
find
the
new
growth
of
the
coming
season
all
snugly
packed
away
there
many
times
folded
up
and
wrapped
about
by
protecting
scales
the
catkins
of
the
birches
alders
and
hazel
are
fully
formed
and
as
in
the
case
of
the
buds
are
like
eggs
to
be
hatched
by
the
warmth
of
spring
the
present
season
is
always
the
mother
of
the
next
and
the
inception
takes
place
long
before
the
sun
loses
his
power
the
eggs
that
hold
the
coming
crop
of
insect
life
are
mostly
laid
in
the
late
summer
or
early
fall
and
an
analogous
start
is
made
in
the
vegetable
world
the
egg
the
seed
the
bud
are
all
alike
in
many
ways
and
look
to
the
future
our
earliest
spring
flower
the
may
be
found
with
its
round
green
an
inch
or
two
above
the
mould
in
december
it
is
ready
to
welcome
and
make
the
most
of
the
first
fitful
march
warmth
look
at
the
elms
too
and
see
how
they
swarm
with
buds
in
early
april
they
suggest
a
swarm
of
bees
in
all
cases
before
nature
closes
her
house
in
the
fall
she
makes
ready
for
its
spring
opening
iv
the
wit
of
a
duck
the
homing
instinct
in
birds
and
animals
is
one
of
their
most
remarkable
traits
their
strong
local
attachments
and
their
skill
in
finding
their
way
back
when
removed
to
a
distance
it
seems
at
times
as
if
they
possessed
some
extra
sense
the
home
sense
which
operates
unerringly
i
saw
this
illustrated
one
spring
in
the
case
of
a
mallard
drake
my
son
had
two
ducks
and
to
mate
with
them
he
procured
a
drake
of
a
neighbor
who
lived
two
miles
south
of
us
he
brought
the
drake
home
in
a
bag
the
bird
had
no
opportunity
to
see
the
road
along
which
it
was
carried
or
to
get
the
general
direction
except
at
the
time
of
starting
when
the
boy
carried
him
a
few
rods
openly
he
was
placed
with
the
ducks
in
a
spring
run
under
a
tree
in
a
secluded
place
on
the
river
slope
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
highway
the
two
ducks
treated
him
very
contemptuously
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
drake
was
homesick
from
the
first
hour
and
he
soon
left
the
presence
of
the
scornful
ducks
then
we
shut
the
three
in
the
barn
together
and
kept
them
there
a
day
and
a
night
still
the
friendship
did
not
ripen
the
ducks
and
the
drake
separated
the
moment
we
let
them
out
left
to
himself
the
drake
at
once
turned
his
head
homeward
and
started
up
the
hill
for
the
highway
then
we
shut
the
trio
up
together
again
for
a
couple
of
days
but
with
the
same
results
as
before
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
thought
in
the
mind
of
the
drake
and
that
was
home
several
times
we
headed
him
off
and
brought
him
back
till
finally
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
i
said
to
my
son
if
that
drake
is
really
bound
to
go
home
he
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
make
the
trial
and
i
will
go
with
him
to
see
that
he
has
fair
play
we
withdrew
and
the
homesick
mallard
started
up
through
the
currant
patch
then
through
the
vineyard
toward
the
highway
which
he
had
never
seen
when
he
reached
the
fence
he
followed
it
south
till
he
came
to
the
open
gate
where
he
took
to
the
road
as
confidently
as
if
he
knew
for
a
certainty
that
it
would
lead
him
straight
to
his
mate
how
eagerly
he
paddled
along
glancing
right
and
left
and
increasing
his
speed
at
every
step
i
kept
about
fifty
yards
behind
him
presently
he
met
a
dog
he
paused
and
eyed
the
animal
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
the
right
along
a
road
which
diverged
just
at
that
point
and
which
led
to
the
railroad
station
i
followed
thinking
the
drake
would
soon
lose
his
bearings
and
get
hopelessly
confused
in
the
tangle
of
roads
that
converged
at
the
station
but
he
seemed
to
have
an
exact
map
of
the
country
in
his
mind
he
soon
left
the
station
road
went
around
a
house
through
a
vineyard
till
he
struck
a
stone
fence
that
crossed
his
course
at
right
angles
this
he
followed
eastward
till
it
was
joined
by
a
barbed
wire
fence
under
which
he
passed
and
again
entered
the
highway
he
had
first
taken
then
down
the
road
he
paddled
with
renewed
confidence
under
the
trees
down
a
hill
through
a
grove
over
a
bridge
up
the
hill
again
toward
home
presently
he
found
his
clue
cut
in
two
by
the
railroad
track
this
was
something
he
had
never
before
seen
he
paused
glanced
up
it
then
down
it
then
at
the
highway
across
it
and
quickly
concluded
this
last
was
his
course
on
he
went
again
faster
and
faster
he
had
now
gone
half
the
distance
and
was
getting
tired
a
little
pool
of
water
by
the
roadside
caught
his
eye
into
it
he
plunged
bathed
drank
preened
his
plumage
for
a
few
moments
and
then
started
homeward
again
he
knew
his
home
was
on
the
upper
side
of
the
road
for
he
kept
his
eye
bent
in
that
direction
scanning
the
fields
twice
he
stopped
stretched
himself
up
and
scanned
the
landscape
intently
then
on
again
it
seemed
as
if
an
invisible
cord
was
attached
to
him
and
he
was
being
pulled
down
the
road
just
opposite
a
farm
lane
which
led
up
to
a
group
of
farm
buildings
and
which
did
indeed
look
like
his
home
lane
he
paused
and
seemed
to
be
debating
with
himself
two
women
just
then
came
along
they
lifted
and
flirted
their
skirts
for
it
was
raining
and
this
disturbed
him
again
and
decided
him
to
take
to
the
farm
lane
up
the
lane
he
went
rather
doubtingly
i
thought
in
a
few
moments
it
brought
him
into
a
where
a
group
of
hens
caught
his
eye
evidently
he
was
on
good
terms
with
hens
at
home
for
he
made
up
to
these
eagerly
as
if
to
tell
them
his
troubles
but
the
hens
knew
not
ducks
they
withdrew
suspiciously
then
assumed
a
threatening
attitude
till
one
old
dominic
put
up
her
feathers
and
charged
upon
him
viciously
again
he
tried
to
make
up
to
them
quacking
softly
and
again
he
was
repulsed
then
the
cattle
in
the
yard
spied
this
strange
creature
and
came
sniffing
toward
it
full
of
curiosity
the
drake
quickly
concluded
he
had
got
into
the
wrong
place
and
turned
his
face
southward
again
through
the
fence
he
went
into
a
plowed
field
presently
another
stone
fence
crossed
his
path
along
this
he
again
turned
toward
the
highway
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
himself
in
a
corner
formed
by
the
meeting
of
two
stone
fences
then
he
turned
appealingly
to
me
uttering
the
soft
note
of
the
mallard
to
use
his
wings
never
seemed
to
cross
his
mind
well
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
helped
the
drake
over
the
wall
but
i
sat
him
down
in
the
road
as
impartially
as
i
could
how
well
his
pink
feet
knew
the
course
how
they
flew
up
the
road
his
green
head
and
white
throat
fairly
twinkled
under
the
long
avenue
of
oaks
and
chestnuts
at
last
we
came
in
sight
of
the
home
lane
which
led
up
to
the
farmhouse
one
hundred
or
more
yards
from
the
road
i
was
curious
to
see
if
he
would
recognize
the
place
at
the
gate
leading
into
the
lane
he
paused
he
had
just
gone
up
a
lane
that
looked
like
that
and
had
been
disappointed
what
should
he
do
now
truth
compels
me
to
say
that
he
overshot
the
mark
he
kept
on
hesitatingly
along
the
highway
it
was
now
nearly
night
i
felt
sure
the
duck
would
soon
discover
his
mistake
but
i
had
not
time
to
watch
the
experiment
further
i
went
around
the
drake
and
turned
him
back
as
he
neared
the
lane
this
time
he
seemed
suddenly
to
see
some
familiar
landmark
and
he
rushed
up
it
at
the
top
of
his
speed
his
joy
and
eagerness
were
almost
pathetic
i
followed
close
into
the
house
yard
he
rushed
with
uplifted
wings
and
fell
down
almost
exhausted
by
the
side
of
his
mate
a
half
hour
later
the
two
were
nipping
the
grass
together
in
the
pasture
and
he
i
have
no
doubt
was
eagerly
telling
her
the
story
of
his
adventures
v
factors
in
animal
life
the
question
that
the
californian
schoolchildren
put
to
me
have
the
birds
got
sense
still
sticks
in
my
crop
such
extraordinary
sense
has
been
attributed
to
most
of
the
wild
creatures
by
several
of
our
latter
day
that
i
have
been
moved
to
examine
the
whole
question
more
thoroughly
than
ever
before
and
to
find
out
as
far
as
i
can
just
how
much
and
what
kind
of
sense
the
birds
and
beasts
have
in
this
and
in
some
following
chapters
i
shall
make
an
effort
to
use
my
own
sense
to
the
best
advantage
in
probing
that
of
the
animals
which
has
as
i
think
been
so
vastly
overrated
when
sentiment
gets
overripe
it
becomes
sentimentalism
the
sentiment
for
nature
which
has
been
so
assiduously
cultivated
in
our
times
is
fast
undergoing
this
change
and
is
softening
into
sentimentalism
toward
the
lower
animals
many
a
wholesome
feeling
can
be
pushed
so
far
that
it
becomes
a
weakness
and
a
sign
of
disease
pity
for
the
sufferings
of
our
brute
neighbors
may
be
a
manly
feeling
and
then
again
it
may
be
so
fostered
and
cosseted
that
it
becomes
maudlin
and
unworthy
when
hospitals
are
founded
for
sick
or
homeless
cats
and
dogs
when
all
forms
of
vivisection
are
cried
down
when
the
animals
are
humanized
and
books
are
written
to
show
that
the
wild
creatures
have
schools
and
kindergartens
and
that
their
young
are
instructed
and
disciplined
in
quite
the
human
way
by
their
fond
parents
when
we
want
to
believe
that
reason
and
not
instinct
guides
them
that
they
are
quite
up
in
some
of
the
simpler
arts
of
surgery
mending
or
amputating
their
own
broken
limbs
and
salving
their
wounds
when
i
say
our
attitude
toward
the
natural
life
about
us
and
our
feeling
for
it
have
reached
the
stage
implied
by
these
things
then
has
sentiment
degenerated
into
sentimentalism
and
our
appreciation
of
nature
lost
its
firm
edge
no
doubt
there
is
a
considerable
number
of
people
in
any
community
that
are
greatly
taken
with
this
improved
anthropomorphic
view
of
wild
nature
now
current
among
us
such
a
view
tickles
the
fancy
and
touches
the
emotions
it
makes
the
wild
creatures
so
much
more
interesting
shall
we
deny
anything
to
a
bird
or
beast
that
makes
it
more
interesting
and
more
worthy
of
our
study
and
admiration
this
sentimental
view
of
animal
life
has
its
good
side
and
its
bad
side
its
good
side
is
its
result
in
making
us
more
considerate
and
merciful
toward
our
brute
neighbors
its
bad
side
is
seen
in
the
degree
to
which
it
leads
to
a
false
interpretation
of
their
lives
the
tendency
to
which
i
refer
is
no
doubt
partly
the
result
of
our
growing
humanitarianism
and
feeling
of
kinship
with
all
the
lower
orders
of
creation
and
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
we
live
in
a
time
of
impromptu
nature
study
when
birds
and
plants
and
trees
are
fast
becoming
a
fad
with
half
the
population
and
when
the
yellow
reporter
is
abroad
in
the
fields
and
woods
never
before
in
my
time
have
so
many
exaggerations
and
misconceptions
of
the
wild
life
about
us
been
current
in
the
popular
mind
it
is
becoming
the
fashion
to
ascribe
to
the
lower
animals
nearly
all
our
human
motives
and
attributes
and
often
to
credit
them
with
plans
and
devices
that
imply
reason
and
a
fair
amount
of
mechanical
knowledge
an
illustration
of
this
is
the
account
of
the
nest
of
a
pair
of
orioles
as
described
in
the
north
american
review
for
may
by
a
writer
of
popular
nature
books
these
orioles
built
a
nest
so
extraordinary
that
it
can
be
accounted
for
only
on
the
theory
that
there
a
school
of
the
woods
and
that
these
two
birds
had
been
pupils
there
and
had
taken
an
advanced
course
in
strings
among
other
things
impossible
for
birds
to
do
these
orioles
tied
a
knot
in
the
end
of
a
string
to
prevent
its
fraying
in
the
wind
if
the
whole
idea
were
not
too
preposterous
for
even
a
child
to
believe
one
might
ask
what
in
the
name
of
anything
and
everything
but
the
modern
school
of
nature
study
do
orioles
know
about
strings
fraying
in
the
wind
and
the
use
of
knots
to
prevent
it
they
have
never
had
occasion
to
know
they
have
had
no
experience
with
strings
that
hang
loose
and
unravel
in
the
wind
they
often
use
strings
to
be
sure
in
building
their
nests
but
they
use
them
in
a
sort
of
haphazard
way
weaving
them
awkwardly
into
the
structure
and
leaving
no
loose
ends
that
would
suffer
by
fraying
in
the
wind
sometimes
they
use
strings
in
attaching
the
nest
to
the
limb
but
they
never
knot
or
tie
them
they
simply
wind
them
round
and
round
as
a
child
might
it
is
possible
that
a
bird
might
be
taught
to
tie
a
knot
with
its
foot
and
beak
though
i
should
have
to
see
it
done
to
be
convinced
but
the
orioles
in
question
not
only
tied
knots
they
tied
them
with
a
reversed
double
hitch
the
kind
that
a
man
uses
in
cinching
his
saddle
more
wonderful
still
not
finding
in
a
new
england
town
a
suitable
branch
from
which
to
suspend
their
nest
the
birds
went
down
upon
the
ground
and
tied
three
twigs
together
in
the
form
of
a
perfectly
measured
triangle
no
doubt
working
from
a
plan
drawn
to
a
scale
they
attached
to
the
three
sides
of
this
framework
four
strings
of
equal
length
eight
or
ten
inches
all
carefully
doubled
tied
them
to
a
heavier
string
carried
the
whole
ingenious
contrivance
to
a
tree
and
tied
it
fast
to
a
limb
in
precisely
the
way
you
or
i
would
have
done
it
from
this
framework
they
suspended
their
nest
the
whole
structure
being
about
two
feet
long
and
having
the
effect
of
a
small
hanging
basket
still
more
astonishing
when
the
genuineness
of
the
nest
is
questioned
a
man
is
found
who
makes
affidavit
that
he
saw
the
orioles
build
it
after
such
a
proceeding
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
are
building
little
rush
cradles
for
their
young
or
rush
boats
to
be
driven
about
the
ponds
and
lakes
by
means
of
leaf
sails
or
before
jenny
wren
will
be
living
in
a
log
cabin
of
her
own
construction
how
long
will
it
be
before
some
one
makes
affidavit
that
the
sparrow
with
his
bow
and
arrow
has
actually
been
seen
to
kill
cock
robin
and
the
beetle
with
his
thread
and
needle
engaged
in
making
the
shroud
birds
show
the
taste
and
skill
of
their
kind
in
building
their
nests
but
rarely
any
individual
ingenuity
and
inventiveness
the
nest
referred
to
is
on
a
plane
entirely
outside
of
nature
and
her
processes
it
belongs
to
a
different
order
of
things
the
order
of
mechanical
contrivances
and
was
of
course
made
up
probably
from
a
real
oriole
nest
and
the
writer
who
vouches
for
its
genuineness
has
been
the
victim
of
a
clever
practical
joke
a
willing
victim
no
doubt
since
he
is
looking
in
nature
for
just
this
kind
of
thing
and
since
he
believes
there
is
absolutely
no
limit
to
the
variety
and
adaptiveness
of
nature
even
in
a
single
species
if
there
is
no
such
limit
then
i
suppose
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
meet
a
winged
horse
or
a
centaur
or
a
mermaid
at
any
time
it
is
as
plain
as
anything
can
be
that
the
animals
share
our
emotional
nature
in
vastly
greater
measure
than
they
do
our
intellectual
or
our
moral
nature
and
because
they
do
this
because
they
show
fear
love
joy
anger
sympathy
jealousy
because
they
suffer
and
are
glad
because
they
form
friendships
and
local
attachments
and
have
the
home
and
paternal
instincts
in
short
because
their
lives
run
parallel
to
our
own
in
so
many
particulars
we
come
if
we
are
not
careful
to
ascribe
to
them
the
whole
human
psychology
but
it
is
equally
plain
that
of
what
we
mean
by
mind
intellect
they
show
only
a
trace
now
and
then
they
do
not
accumulate
a
store
of
knowledge
any
more
than
they
do
a
store
of
riches
a
store
of
knowledge
is
impossible
without
language
man
began
to
emerge
from
the
lower
orders
when
he
invented
a
language
of
some
sort
as
the
language
of
animals
is
little
more
than
various
cries
expressive
of
pleasure
or
pain
or
fear
or
suspicion
they
do
not
think
in
any
proper
sense
because
they
have
no
terms
in
which
to
think
no
language
i
shall
have
more
to
say
upon
this
point
in
another
chapter
one
trait
they
do
show
which
is
the
first
step
toward
knowledge
curiosity
nearly
all
the
animals
show
at
times
varying
degrees
of
curiosity
but
here
again
an
instinctive
feeling
of
possible
danger
probably
lies
back
of
it
they
even
seem
to
show
at
times
a
kind
of
altruistic
feeling
a
correspondent
writes
me
that
she
possessed
a
canary
which
lived
to
so
great
an
age
that
it
finally
became
so
feeble
it
could
not
crack
the
seeds
she
gave
it
when
the
other
birds
its
own
progeny
it
is
true
fed
it
and
darwin
cites
cases
of
blind
birds
in
a
state
of
nature
being
fed
by
their
fellows
probably
it
would
be
hasty
to
conclude
that
such
acts
show
anything
more
than
instinct
i
should
be
slow
to
ascribe
to
the
animals
any
notion
of
the
uses
of
punishment
as
we
practice
it
though
the
cat
will
box
her
kittens
when
they
play
too
long
with
her
tail
and
the
mother
hen
will
separate
her
chickens
when
they
get
into
a
fight
and
sometimes
peck
one
or
both
of
them
on
the
head
as
much
as
to
say
there
do
you
do
that
again
the
rooster
will
in
the
same
way
separate
two
hens
when
they
are
fighting
on
the
surface
this
seems
like
a
very
human
act
but
can
we
say
that
it
is
punishment
or
discipline
in
the
human
sense
as
having
for
its
aim
a
betterment
of
the
manners
of
the
kittens
or
of
the
chickens
the
cat
aims
to
get
rid
of
an
annoyance
and
the
rooster
and
the
mother
hen
interfere
to
prevent
an
injury
to
members
of
their
family
they
exhibit
the
paternal
and
maternal
instinct
of
protection
more
than
that
would
imply
ethical
considerations
of
which
the
lower
animals
are
not
capable
the
act
of
the
baboon
mentioned
by
darwin
i
believe
that
examined
the
paws
of
the
cat
that
had
scratched
it
and
then
deliberately
bit
off
the
nails
belongs
to
a
different
and
to
a
higher
order
of
conduct
a
complete
statement
of
the
factors
that
shape
the
lives
of
the
lower
orders
would
include
three
terms
instinct
imitation
though
doubtless
this
is
instinctive
and
experience
instinct
is
of
course
the
main
factor
and
by
this
term
we
mean
that
which
prompts
an
animal
or
a
man
to
act
spontaneously
without
instruction
or
experience
all
creatures
are
imitative
and
man
himself
not
the
least
so
i
had
a
visit
the
other
day
from
a
woman
who
had
spent
the
last
two
years
in
london
and
her
speech
betrayed
the
fact
she
had
quite
unconsciously
caught
certain
of
the
english
mannerisms
of
speech
a
few
years
in
the
south
will
give
the
new
englander
the
southern
accent
and
vice
versa
the
young
are
of
course
more
imitative
than
the
old
children
imitate
their
parents
the
young
writer
imitates
his
favorite
author
animals
of
different
species
closely
associated
will
imitate
each
other
a
lady
writes
me
that
she
has
a
rabbit
that
lives
in
a
cage
with
a
monkey
and
that
it
has
caught
many
of
the
monkey
ways
i
can
well
believe
it
dogs
reared
with
cats
have
been
known
to
acquire
the
cat
habit
of
licking
the
paws
and
then
washing
the
ears
and
face
wolves
reared
with
dogs
learn
to
bark
and
who
has
not
seen
a
dog
draw
its
face
as
if
trying
to
laugh
as
its
master
does
when
a
cat
has
been
taught
to
sit
up
for
its
food
its
kittens
have
been
known
to
imitate
the
mother
darwin
tells
of
a
cat
that
used
to
put
its
paw
into
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
and
then
lick
it
off
and
that
its
kittens
soon
learned
the
same
trick
in
all
such
cases
hasty
observers
say
the
mother
taught
its
young
certainly
the
young
learned
but
there
was
no
effort
to
teach
on
the
part
of
the
parent
unconscious
imitation
did
it
all
our
modern
school
of
nature
study
would
say
that
the
old
sow
teaches
her
pigs
to
root
when
they
follow
her
afield
rooting
in
their
little
ways
as
she
does
but
would
she
not
root
if
she
had
no
pigs
and
would
not
the
pigs
root
if
they
had
no
mother
all
acts
necessary
to
an
animal
life
and
to
the
continuance
of
the
species
are
instinctive
the
creature
does
not
have
to
be
taught
them
nor
are
they
acquired
by
imitation
the
bird
does
not
have
to
be
taught
to
build
its
nest
or
to
fly
nor
the
beaver
to
build
its
dam
or
its
house
nor
the
otter
or
the
seal
to
swim
nor
the
young
of
mammals
to
suckle
nor
the
spider
to
spin
its
web
nor
the
grub
to
weave
its
cocoon
nature
does
not
trust
these
things
to
chance
they
are
too
vital
the
things
that
an
animal
acquires
by
imitation
are
of
secondary
importance
in
its
life
as
soon
as
the
calf
or
the
lamb
or
the
colt
can
get
upon
its
feet
its
first
impulse
is
to
find
the
udder
of
its
dam
it
requires
no
instruction
or
experience
to
take
this
important
step
how
far
the
different
species
of
acquire
each
their
peculiar
songs
by
imitation
is
a
question
that
has
not
yet
been
fully
settled
that
imitation
has
much
to
do
with
it
admits
of
little
doubt
the
song
of
a
bird
is
of
secondary
importance
in
its
life
birds
reared
in
captivity
where
they
have
never
heard
the
songs
of
their
kind
sing
at
the
proper
age
but
not
always
the
songs
of
their
parents
scott
of
princeton
proved
this
with
his
orioles
they
sang
at
the
proper
age
but
not
the
regular
oriole
song
i
am
told
that
there
is
a
case
of
an
english
sparrow
brought
up
with
canaries
that
learned
to
sing
like
a
canary
the
hon
daines
barrington
placed
three
young
linnets
with
three
different
the
skylark
the
woodlark
and
the
titlark
or
and
each
adopted
through
imitation
the
song
of
its
i
have
myself
heard
goldfinches
that
were
reared
in
a
cage
sing
beautifully
but
not
the
regular
goldfinch
song
it
was
clearly
the
song
of
a
finch
but
of
what
finch
i
could
not
have
told
i
have
also
heard
a
robin
that
sang
to
perfection
the
song
of
the
brown
thrasher
it
had
no
doubt
caught
it
by
imitation
i
have
heard
another
robin
that
had
the
call
of
the
quail
interpolated
into
its
own
proper
robin
song
but
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
a
robin
building
a
nest
like
a
brown
thrasher
or
of
an
oriole
building
a
nest
like
a
robin
or
of
kingfishers
drilling
for
grubs
in
a
tree
the
hen
can
not
keep
out
of
the
water
the
ducks
she
has
hatched
nor
can
the
duck
coax
into
the
water
the
chickens
she
has
hatched
the
cowbird
hatched
and
reared
by
the
sparrow
or
the
warbler
or
the
vireo
does
not
sing
the
song
of
the
why
did
its
parent
not
try
to
teach
it
i
have
no
evidence
that
young
birds
sing
except
occasionally
in
a
low
tentative
kind
of
way
till
they
return
the
following
season
and
then
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
robins
staying
with
robins
and
cowbirds
with
cowbirds
each
singing
the
song
of
its
species
the
songs
of
bobolinks
differ
in
different
localities
but
those
of
the
same
locality
always
sing
alike
i
once
had
a
caged
skylark
that
imitated
the
songs
of
nearly
every
bird
in
my
neighborhood
leander
keyser
author
of
birds
of
the
rockies
relates
in
forest
and
stream
the
results
of
his
experiments
with
a
variety
of
birds
taken
from
the
nest
while
very
young
and
reared
in
captivity
among
them
meadowlarks
blackbirds
brown
thrashers
blue
jays
wood
thrushes
catbirds
flickers
woodpeckers
and
several
others
did
they
receive
any
parental
instruction
not
a
bit
of
it
and
yet
at
the
proper
age
they
flew
perched
called
and
sang
like
their
wild
fellows
all
except
the
robins
and
the
blackbirds
these
did
not
sing
the
songs
of
their
species
but
sang
a
medley
made
up
of
curious
imitations
of
human
and
other
sounds
and
the
blue
jay
never
learned
to
sing
the
sweet
gurgling
roulade
of
the
wild
jays
though
it
gave
the
blue
jay
call
correctly
experiment
was
interesting
and
valuable
but
his
sagacity
fails
him
when
interpreting
the
action
of
the
jay
in
roosting
in
an
exposed
place
after
it
had
been
given
its
liberty
he
thinks
this
showed
how
little
instinct
can
be
relied
on
and
how
much
the
bird
needed
parental
instruction
could
he
not
see
that
the
artificial
life
of
the
bird
in
the
cage
had
demoralized
its
instincts
and
that
acquired
habits
had
supplanted
native
tendencies
the
bird
had
learned
to
be
unafraid
in
the
cage
and
why
should
it
be
afraid
out
of
the
cage
this
reminds
me
of
a
letter
from
a
correspondent
he
had
a
tame
crow
that
was
not
afraid
of
a
gun
therefore
he
concluded
that
the
old
crows
must
instill
the
fear
of
guns
into
their
young
why
should
the
crow
be
afraid
of
a
gun
if
it
had
learned
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
gunner
i
have
seen
a
young
chickadee
fly
late
in
the
day
from
the
nest
in
the
cavity
of
a
tree
straight
to
a
where
it
perched
close
to
the
trunk
and
remained
unregarded
by
its
parents
till
next
morning
but
no
doubt
its
parents
had
given
it
minute
directions
before
it
left
the
nest
how
to
fly
and
where
to
perch
that
animals
learn
by
experience
in
a
limited
way
is
very
certain
yet
that
old
birds
build
better
nests
or
sing
better
than
young
ones
it
would
be
hard
to
prove
though
it
seems
reasonable
that
it
should
be
so
rarely
does
one
see
nests
of
the
same
species
of
varying
degrees
of
excellence
that
is
first
nests
in
the
spring
the
second
nest
of
any
species
is
likely
to
be
a
more
hurried
and
incomplete
affair
some
species
are
at
all
times
poor
as
the
cuckoos
and
the
pigeons
other
birds
are
good
as
the
orioles
the
thrushes
the
finches
the
warblers
the
hummingbirds
and
one
never
finds
an
inferior
specimen
of
the
nests
of
any
of
these
birds
there
is
probably
no
more
improvement
in
this
respect
among
birds
than
there
is
among
insects
i
have
no
proof
that
wild
birds
improve
in
singing
one
does
not
hear
a
vireo
or
a
finch
or
a
thrush
or
a
warbler
that
is
noticeably
inferior
as
a
songster
to
its
fellows
their
songs
are
all
alike
except
in
the
few
rare
cases
when
one
hears
a
master
songster
among
its
kind
but
whether
this
mastery
is
natural
or
acquired
who
shall
tell
what
birds
learn
about
migration
if
anything
i
do
not
see
that
we
have
any
means
of
finding
out
it
has
been
observed
of
birds
reared
under
artificial
conditions
that
the
young
males
practice
a
long
time
before
they
sing
well
that
this
is
true
of
wild
birds
there
is
no
proof
what
birds
and
animals
learn
by
experience
is
greater
cunning
does
not
even
an
old
trout
know
more
about
hooks
than
a
young
one
birds
of
any
kind
that
are
much
hunted
become
wilder
even
though
they
have
not
had
the
experience
of
being
shot
ask
any
duck
or
grouse
or
quail
hunter
if
this
is
not
so
our
ruffed
grouse
learns
to
fly
with
a
corkscrew
motion
where
it
is
much
fired
at
on
the
wing
how
wary
and
cautious
the
fox
becomes
in
regions
where
it
is
much
trapped
and
hunted
even
the
woodchuck
becomes
very
wild
on
the
farms
where
it
is
much
shot
at
and
this
wildness
extends
to
its
young
in
his
wilderness
hunter
president
roosevelt
says
the
same
thing
of
the
big
game
of
the
rockies
antelope
and
deer
can
be
lured
near
the
concealed
hunter
by
the
waving
of
a
small
flag
till
they
are
shot
at
a
few
times
then
they
see
through
the
trick
the
burnt
child
fears
the
fire
animals
profit
by
experience
in
this
way
they
learn
what
not
to
do
in
the
accumulation
of
positive
knowledge
so
far
as
we
know
they
make
little
or
no
progress
birds
and
beasts
will
adapt
themselves
more
or
less
to
their
environment
but
plants
and
trees
will
do
that
too
the
rats
in
jamaica
have
learned
to
nest
in
trees
to
escape
the
mongoose
but
this
is
only
the
triumph
of
the
instinct
of
the
mongoose
has
not
yet
learned
to
climb
trees
the
pressure
of
need
is
not
yet
great
enough
it
is
said
that
in
districts
subject
to
floods
often
build
in
trees
all
animals
will
change
their
habits
under
pressure
of
necessity
man
changes
his
without
this
pressure
the
duke
of
argyll
saw
a
bald
eagle
seize
a
fish
in
the
stream
an
unusual
proceeding
but
the
eagle
was
doubtless
very
hungry
and
there
was
no
osprey
near
upon
whom
to
levy
tribute
romanes
found
that
rats
would
get
certain
foods
out
of
a
bottle
with
their
tails
as
a
cat
will
get
milk
out
of
a
jar
with
her
paw
but
neither
ever
progresses
so
far
as
to
use
any
sort
of
tool
for
the
purpose
or
to
tip
the
vessel
over
animals
practice
concealment
to
secure
their
prey
but
not
deception
as
man
does
they
do
not
use
lures
or
disguises
or
traps
or
poison
there
is
of
course
no
limit
to
the
variety
and
adaptiveness
of
nature
taken
as
a
whole
but
each
species
is
hedged
about
by
impassable
limitations
the
ouzel
is
akin
to
the
thrushes
and
yet
it
lives
along
and
in
the
water
does
it
ever
take
to
the
fields
and
woods
and
live
on
fruit
and
and
nest
in
trees
like
other
thrushes
so
with
all
birds
and
beasts
they
vary
constantly
but
not
in
one
lifetime
and
the
sum
of
these
variations
accumulated
through
natural
selection
as
darwin
has
shown
gives
rise
in
the
course
of
long
periods
of
time
to
new
species
as
i
have
already
said
domestic
animals
vary
more
than
wild
ones
every
farmer
and
knows
that
some
hens
are
better
with
chickens
than
others
more
motherly
more
careful
and
rear
a
greater
number
of
their
brood
the
same
is
true
of
sows
with
pigs
some
sows
will
eat
their
pigs
and
wild
animals
in
cages
often
destroy
their
young
some
ewes
will
not
own
their
lambs
and
occasionally
a
cow
will
not
own
her
calf
such
cases
show
perverted
or
demoralized
instinct
similar
to
these
are
the
strange
friendships
that
sometimes
occur
among
the
domestic
animals
as
that
of
a
sheep
with
a
cow
a
goose
with
a
horse
or
a
hen
adopting
kittens
in
a
state
of
nature
these
curious
attachments
probably
never
spring
up
instinct
is
likely
to
be
more
or
less
demoralized
when
animal
life
touches
human
life
with
the
wild
creatures
we
sometimes
see
one
instinct
overcoming
another
as
when
fear
drives
a
bird
to
desert
its
nest
or
when
the
instinct
of
migration
leads
a
pair
of
swallows
to
desert
their
unfledged
young
a
great
many
young
birds
come
to
grief
by
leaving
the
nest
before
they
can
fly
in
such
cases
i
suppose
they
disobey
the
parental
instructions
i
find
it
easier
to
believe
that
instinct
is
at
fault
or
that
one
instinct
has
overcome
another
something
has
disturbed
or
alarmed
the
young
birds
and
the
fear
of
danger
has
led
them
to
attempt
flight
before
their
wings
were
strong
enough
once
when
i
was
climbing
up
to
the
nest
of
a
hawk
the
young
took
fright
and
launched
out
in
the
air
coming
to
the
ground
only
a
few
rods
away
instinct
natural
prompting
is
the
main
matter
after
all
it
makes
up
at
least
nine
tenths
of
the
lives
of
all
our
wild
neighbors
how
much
has
fear
had
to
do
in
shaping
their
lives
and
in
perpetuating
them
and
fear
of
any
particular
enemy
says
darwin
is
certainly
an
instinctive
quality
it
has
been
said
that
kittens
confined
in
a
box
and
which
have
never
known
a
dog
will
spit
and
put
up
their
backs
at
a
hand
that
has
just
stroked
a
dog
even
before
their
eyes
are
opened
one
authority
says
but
this
i
doubt
my
son
tame
gray
squirrel
had
never
seen
chestnuts
nor
learned
about
them
in
the
school
of
the
woods
and
yet
when
he
was
offered
some
he
fairly
danced
with
excitement
he
put
his
paws
eagerly
around
them
and
drew
them
to
him
and
chattered
and
looked
threateningly
at
all
about
him
does
man
know
his
proper
food
in
the
same
way
the
child
has
only
the
instinct
to
eat
and
will
put
anything
into
its
mouth
how
the
instinctive
wildness
of
the
turkey
crops
out
in
the
young
let
the
mother
turkey
while
hovering
her
brood
give
the
and
the
young
will
run
from
under
her
and
hide
in
the
grass
why
to
give
her
a
chance
to
fly
and
decoy
away
the
enemy
i
think
young
chickens
will
do
the
same
young
partridges
hatched
under
a
hen
run
away
at
once
pheasants
in
england
reared
under
a
domestic
fowl
are
as
wild
as
in
a
state
of
nature
some
california
quail
hatched
under
a
bantam
hen
in
the
zoo
in
new
york
did
not
heed
the
calls
of
their
at
all
the
first
week
but
at
her
they
instantly
squatted
showing
that
the
of
a
fowl
is
a
kind
of
universal
language
that
all
species
understand
one
may
prove
this
at
any
time
by
arousing
the
fears
of
any
wild
bird
how
all
the
other
birds
catch
the
alarm
charles
john
says
that
in
scotland
the
stag
you
are
stalking
is
sure
to
be
put
to
flight
if
it
hears
the
of
the
you
see
it
is
more
important
that
the
wild
creatures
should
understand
the
of
one
another
than
that
they
should
understand
the
rest
of
their
language
to
what
extent
animals
reason
or
show
any
glimmering
of
what
we
call
reason
is
a
question
among
animal
psychologists
and
i
shall
have
more
to
say
upon
the
subject
later
on
dogs
undoubtedly
show
gleams
of
reason
and
other
animals
in
domestication
such
as
the
elephant
and
the
monkey
one
does
not
often
feel
like
questioning
darwin
conclusions
yet
the
incident
of
the
caged
bear
which
he
quotes
that
pawed
the
water
in
front
of
its
cage
to
create
a
current
that
should
float
within
its
reach
a
piece
of
bread
that
had
been
placed
there
does
not
in
my
judgment
show
any
reasoning
about
the
laws
of
hydrostatics
the
bear
would
doubtless
have
pawed
a
cloth
in
the
same
way
vaguely
seeking
to
draw
the
bread
within
reach
but
when
an
elephant
blows
through
his
trunk
upon
the
ground
an
object
which
he
wants
but
which
is
beyond
his
reach
so
that
the
rebounding
air
will
drive
it
toward
him
he
shows
something
very
much
like
reason
instinct
is
a
kind
of
natural
reason
reason
that
acts
without
proof
or
experience
the
principle
of
life
in
organic
nature
seeks
in
all
ways
to
express
and
to
perpetuate
itself
it
finds
many
degrees
of
expression
and
fulfillment
in
the
vegetable
world
it
finds
higher
degrees
of
expression
and
fulfillment
in
the
animal
world
reaching
its
highest
development
in
man
that
the
animals
except
those
that
have
been
long
associated
with
man
and
they
only
in
occasional
gleams
and
hints
are
capable
of
any
of
our
complex
mental
processes
that
they
are
capable
of
an
act
of
reflection
of
connecting
cause
and
effect
of
putting
this
and
that
together
is
to
me
void
of
proof
why
there
are
yet
savage
tribes
in
which
the
woman
is
regarded
as
the
sole
parent
of
the
child
when
the
mother
is
sick
at
childbirth
the
father
takes
to
his
bed
and
feigns
the
illness
he
does
not
feel
in
order
to
establish
his
relationship
to
the
child
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
the
males
of
any
species
of
animals
or
the
females
either
are
guided
or
influenced
in
their
actions
by
the
desire
for
offspring
or
that
they
possess
anything
like
knowledge
of
the
connection
between
their
and
their
offspring
this
knowledge
comes
of
reflection
and
reflection
the
lower
animals
are
not
capable
of
but
i
shall
have
more
to
say
upon
this
point
in
another
chapter
entitled
what
do
animals
know
i
will
only
say
here
that
animals
are
almost
as
much
under
the
dominion
of
absolute
nature
or
what
we
call
instinct
innate
tendency
habit
of
growth
as
are
the
plants
and
trees
their
lives
revolve
around
three
wants
or
needs
the
want
of
food
of
safety
and
of
offspring
it
is
in
securing
these
ends
that
all
their
wit
is
developed
they
have
no
wants
outside
of
these
spheres
as
man
has
their
social
wants
and
their
love
of
beauty
as
in
some
of
the
birds
are
secondary
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
animals
that
store
up
food
for
the
winter
do
not
take
any
thought
of
the
future
nature
takes
thought
for
them
and
gives
them
their
provident
instinct
the
jay
by
his
propensity
to
carry
away
and
hide
things
plants
many
of
our
oak
and
chestnut
trees
but
who
dares
say
that
he
does
this
on
purpose
any
more
than
that
the
insects
the
flowers
on
purpose
sheep
do
not
take
thought
of
the
wool
upon
their
backs
that
is
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
of
winter
nor
does
the
fox
of
his
fur
in
the
tropics
sheep
cease
to
grow
wool
in
three
or
four
years
all
the
lower
animals
so
far
as
i
know
swim
the
first
time
they
find
themselves
in
the
water
they
do
not
have
to
be
taught
it
is
a
matter
of
instinct
it
is
what
we
should
expect
from
our
knowledge
of
their
lives
not
so
with
man
he
must
learn
to
swim
as
he
learns
so
many
other
things
the
stimulus
of
the
water
does
not
at
once
set
in
motion
his
legs
and
arms
in
the
right
way
as
it
does
the
animal
legs
his
powers
of
reason
and
reflection
paralyze
him
his
brain
carries
him
down
not
until
he
has
learned
to
resign
himself
to
the
water
as
the
animal
does
and
to
go
on
all
fours
can
he
swim
as
soon
as
the
boy
ceases
to
struggle
against
his
tendency
to
sink
assumes
the
horizontal
position
and
strikes
out
as
the
animal
does
with
but
one
thought
and
that
to
apply
his
powers
of
locomotion
to
the
medium
about
him
he
swims
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
said
that
children
have
sometimes
been
known
to
swim
when
thrown
into
the
water
their
animal
instincts
were
not
thwarted
by
their
powers
of
reflection
doubtless
this
never
happened
to
a
grown
person
moreover
is
it
not
probable
that
the
specific
gravity
of
the
hairless
human
body
is
greater
than
that
of
the
animal
and
that
it
sinks
while
that
of
the
cat
or
dog
floats
this
with
the
erect
position
of
man
makes
swimming
with
him
an
art
that
must
be
acquired
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
the
action
of
instinct
as
opposed
to
conscious
intelligence
than
is
afforded
by
the
parasitic
birds
the
cuckoo
in
europe
and
the
cowbird
in
this
country
birds
that
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nests
of
other
birds
darwin
speculates
as
to
how
this
instinct
came
about
but
whatever
may
have
been
its
genesis
it
is
now
a
fixed
habit
among
these
birds
moreover
the
instinct
of
the
blind
young
alien
a
day
or
two
after
it
is
hatched
to
throw
or
crowd
its
out
of
the
nest
is
a
strange
and
anomalous
act
and
is
as
untaught
and
unreasoned
as
anything
in
vegetable
life
but
when
our
yellow
warbler
finding
this
strange
egg
of
the
cowbird
in
her
nest
proceeds
to
bury
it
by
putting
another
bottom
in
the
nest
and
carrying
up
the
sides
to
correspond
she
shows
something
very
much
like
sense
and
judgment
though
of
a
clumsy
kind
how
much
simpler
and
easier
it
would
be
to
throw
out
the
strange
egg
i
have
known
the
cowbird
herself
to
carry
an
egg
from
a
nest
in
which
she
wished
to
deposit
one
of
her
own
again
how
stupid
and
ludicrous
it
seems
on
the
part
of
the
mother
sparrow
or
warbler
or
vireo
when
she
goes
about
toiling
desperately
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
her
big
clamorous
bantling
of
a
cowbird
never
suspecting
that
she
has
been
imposed
upon
of
course
the
line
that
divides
man
from
the
lower
orders
is
not
a
straight
line
it
has
many
breaks
and
curves
and
deep
indentations
the
apes
as
it
were
mark
where
the
line
rises
up
into
the
domain
of
man
furthermore
the
elephant
and
the
dog
especially
as
we
know
them
in
domestication
encroach
upon
man
territory
men
are
born
with
aptitudes
for
different
things
but
the
art
and
the
science
of
them
all
they
have
to
learn
proficiency
comes
with
practice
man
must
learn
to
spin
his
web
to
build
his
house
to
sing
his
song
to
know
his
food
to
sail
his
craft
to
find
his
way
things
that
the
animals
know
from
the
jump
the
animal
inherits
its
knowledge
and
its
skill
man
must
acquire
his
by
individual
effort
all
he
inherits
is
capacity
in
varying
degrees
for
these
things
the
animal
does
rational
things
without
an
exercise
of
reason
it
is
intelligent
as
nature
is
intelligent
it
does
not
know
that
it
knows
or
how
it
knows
while
man
does
man
knowledge
is
the
light
of
his
mind
that
shines
on
many
and
widely
different
objects
while
the
knowledge
of
animals
can
not
be
symbolized
by
the
term
light
at
all
the
animal
acts
blindly
so
far
as
any
conscious
individual
illumination
or
act
of
judgment
is
concerned
it
does
the
thing
unwittingly
because
it
must
confront
it
with
a
new
condition
and
it
has
no
resources
to
meet
that
condition
the
animal
knows
what
necessity
taught
its
progenitors
and
it
knows
that
only
as
a
spontaneous
impulse
to
do
certain
things
instinct
i
say
is
a
great
matter
and
often
shames
reason
it
adapts
means
to
an
end
it
makes
few
or
no
mistakes
it
takes
note
of
times
and
seasons
it
delves
it
bores
it
spins
it
weaves
it
sews
it
builds
it
makes
paper
it
constructs
a
shelter
it
navigates
the
air
and
the
water
it
is
provident
and
thrifty
it
knows
its
enemies
it
outwits
its
foes
it
crosses
oceans
and
continents
without
compass
it
foreshadows
nearly
all
the
arts
and
trades
and
occupations
of
mankind
it
is
skilled
without
practice
and
wise
without
experience
how
it
arose
what
its
genesis
was
who
can
tell
probably
natural
selection
has
been
the
chief
agent
in
its
development
if
natural
selection
has
developed
and
sharpened
the
claws
of
the
cat
and
the
scent
of
the
fox
why
should
it
not
develop
and
sharpen
their
wits
also
the
remote
ancestors
of
the
fox
or
of
the
crow
were
doubtless
less
shrewd
and
cunning
than
the
crows
and
the
foxes
of
the
instinctive
intelligence
of
an
animal
of
our
time
is
the
sum
of
the
variations
toward
greater
intelligence
of
all
its
ancestors
what
man
stores
in
language
and
in
books
the
accumulated
results
of
experience
the
animals
seem
to
have
stored
in
instinct
as
darwin
says
a
man
can
not
on
his
first
trial
make
a
stone
hatchet
or
a
canoe
through
his
power
of
imitation
he
has
to
learn
his
work
by
practice
a
beaver
on
the
other
hand
can
make
its
dam
or
canal
and
a
bird
its
nest
as
well
or
nearly
as
well
and
a
spider
its
wonderful
web
quite
as
well
the
first
time
it
tries
as
when
old
and
experienced
an
animal
shows
intelligence
as
distinct
from
instinct
when
it
takes
advantage
of
any
circumstance
that
arises
at
the
moment
when
it
finds
new
ways
whether
better
or
not
as
when
certain
birds
desert
their
old
and
take
up
with
new
ones
afforded
by
man
this
act
at
least
shows
power
of
choice
the
birds
and
beasts
all
quickly
avail
themselves
of
any
new
source
of
food
supply
their
wits
are
probably
more
keen
and
active
here
than
in
any
other
direction
it
is
said
that
in
oklahoma
the
coyotes
have
learned
to
tell
ripe
watermelons
from
unripe
ones
by
scratching
upon
them
if
they
have
not
they
probably
will
eating
is
the
one
thing
that
engrosses
the
attention
of
all
creatures
and
the
procuring
of
food
has
been
a
great
means
of
education
to
all
i
notice
that
certain
of
the
mice
and
squirrels
and
birds
eat
mushrooms
if
i
would
eat
them
i
must
learn
how
to
distinguish
the
edible
from
the
poisonous
ones
i
have
no
special
sense
to
guide
me
in
the
matter
as
doubtless
the
squirrels
have
their
instinct
is
sure
where
my
reason
fails
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
know
if
they
ever
make
a
mistake
in
this
matter
domestic
animals
sometimes
make
mistakes
as
to
their
food
because
their
instinct
has
been
tampered
with
and
is
by
no
means
as
sure
as
that
of
the
wild
creatures
it
is
said
that
sheep
will
occasionally
eat
laurel
and
which
are
poisonous
to
them
in
the
far
west
i
was
told
that
the
horses
sometimes
eat
a
weed
called
the
that
makes
them
crazy
i
have
since
learned
that
the
buffaloes
and
cattle
with
a
strain
of
the
buffalo
blood
never
eat
this
weed
the
imitation
among
the
lower
animals
to
which
i
have
referred
is
in
no
sense
akin
to
teaching
the
boy
does
not
learn
arithmetic
by
imitation
to
teach
is
to
bring
one
mind
to
act
upon
another
mind
it
is
the
result
of
a
conscious
effort
on
the
part
of
both
teacher
and
pupil
the
child
says
darwin
has
an
instinctive
tendency
to
speak
but
not
to
brew
or
bake
or
write
the
child
comes
to
speak
by
imitation
as
does
the
parrot
and
then
learns
the
meaning
of
words
as
the
parrot
does
not
i
am
convinced
there
is
nothing
in
the
notion
that
animals
consciously
teach
their
young
is
it
probable
that
a
mere
animal
reflects
upon
the
future
any
more
than
it
does
upon
the
past
is
it
solicitous
about
the
future
of
its
offspring
any
more
than
it
is
curious
about
its
ancestry
persons
who
think
they
see
the
lower
animals
training
their
young
consciously
or
unconsciously
supply
something
to
their
observations
they
read
their
own
thoughts
or
preconceptions
into
what
they
see
yet
so
trained
a
naturalist
and
experienced
a
hunter
as
president
roosevelt
differs
with
me
in
this
matter
in
a
letter
which
i
am
permitted
to
quote
he
says
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
there
is
a
large
amount
of
teaching
by
of
their
offspring
in
unfrequented
places
i
have
had
the
deer
watch
me
with
almost
as
much
indifference
as
they
do
now
in
the
yellowstone
park
in
frequented
places
where
they
are
hunted
young
deer
and
young
mountain
sheep
on
the
other
hand
and
of
course
young
wolves
bobcats
and
the
like
are
exceedingly
wary
and
shy
when
the
sight
or
smell
of
man
is
concerned
undoubtedly
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
from
their
earliest
moments
of
going
about
they
learn
to
imitate
the
unflagging
watchfulness
of
their
parents
and
by
the
exercise
of
some
associative
or
imitative
quality
they
grow
to
imitate
and
then
to
share
the
alarm
displayed
by
the
older
ones
at
the
smell
or
presence
of
man
a
young
deer
that
has
never
seen
a
man
feels
no
instinctive
alarm
at
his
presence
or
at
least
very
little
but
it
will
undoubtedly
learn
to
associate
extreme
alarm
with
his
presence
from
merely
accompanying
its
mother
if
the
latter
feels
such
alarm
i
should
not
regard
this
as
schooling
by
the
parent
any
more
than
i
should
so
regard
the
instant
flight
of
twenty
antelope
who
had
not
seen
a
hunter
because
the
has
seen
him
and
has
instantly
run
sometimes
a
deer
or
an
antelope
will
deliberately
give
an
at
sight
of
something
strange
this
cry
at
once
puts
every
deer
or
antelope
on
the
alert
but
they
will
be
just
as
much
on
the
alert
if
they
witness
nothing
but
an
exhibition
of
fright
and
flight
on
the
part
of
the
first
deer
or
antelope
without
there
being
any
conscious
effort
on
its
part
to
express
alarm
moreover
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
on
certain
occasions
rare
though
they
may
be
there
is
a
conscious
effort
at
teaching
i
have
myself
known
of
one
setter
dog
which
would
thrash
its
puppy
soundly
if
the
latter
carelessly
or
stupidly
flushed
a
bird
something
similar
may
occur
in
the
wild
state
among
such
intelligent
beasts
as
wolves
and
foxes
indeed
i
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
with
both
of
these
animals
it
does
occur
that
is
that
there
is
conscious
as
well
as
unconscious
teaching
of
the
young
in
such
matters
as
traps
probably
the
president
and
i
differ
more
in
the
meaning
we
attach
to
the
same
words
than
in
anything
else
in
a
subsequent
letter
he
says
i
think
the
chief
difference
between
you
and
me
in
the
matter
is
one
of
terminology
when
i
speak
of
unconscious
teaching
i
really
mean
simply
acting
in
a
manner
which
arouses
imitation
imitation
is
no
doubt
the
key
to
the
whole
matter
the
animals
unconsciously
teach
their
young
by
their
example
and
in
no
other
way
but
i
must
leave
the
discussion
of
this
subject
for
another
chapter
vi
animal
communication
the
notion
that
animals
consciously
train
and
educate
their
young
has
been
held
only
tentatively
by
european
writers
on
natural
history
darwin
does
not
seem
to
have
been
of
this
opinion
at
all
wallace
shared
it
at
one
time
in
regard
to
the
birds
their
songs
and
but
abandoned
it
later
and
fell
back
upon
instinct
or
inherited
habit
some
of
the
german
writers
such
as
brehm
büchner
and
the
müllers
seem
to
have
held
to
the
notion
more
decidedly
but
professor
groos
had
not
yet
opened
their
eyes
to
the
significance
of
the
play
of
animals
the
writers
mentioned
undoubtedly
read
the
instinctive
play
of
animals
as
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
parents
to
teach
their
young
that
the
examples
of
the
parents
in
many
ways
stimulate
the
imitative
instincts
of
the
young
is
quite
certain
but
that
the
parents
in
any
sense
aim
at
instruction
is
an
idea
no
longer
held
by
writers
on
animal
psychology
of
course
it
all
depends
upon
what
we
mean
by
teaching
do
we
mean
the
communication
of
knowledge
or
the
communication
of
emotion
it
seems
to
me
that
by
teaching
we
mean
the
former
man
alone
communicates
knowledge
the
lower
animals
communicate
feeling
or
emotion
hence
their
communications
always
refer
to
the
present
never
to
the
past
or
to
the
future
that
birds
and
beasts
do
communicate
with
each
other
who
can
doubt
but
that
they
impart
knowledge
that
they
have
any
knowledge
to
impart
in
the
strict
meaning
of
the
word
any
store
of
ideas
or
mental
concepts
that
is
quite
another
matter
teaching
implies
such
store
of
ideas
and
power
to
impart
them
the
subconscious
self
rules
in
the
animal
the
conscious
self
rules
in
man
and
the
conscious
self
alone
can
teach
or
communicate
knowledge
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
of
the
deer
and
the
antelope
referred
to
by
president
roosevelt
in
the
letter
to
me
quoted
in
the
last
chapter
show
the
communication
of
emotion
only
teaching
implies
reflection
and
judgment
it
implies
a
thought
of
and
solicitude
for
the
future
the
young
will
need
this
knowledge
says
the
human
parent
and
so
we
will
impart
it
to
them
now
but
the
animal
parent
has
consciously
no
knowledge
to
impart
only
fear
or
suspicion
one
may
affirm
almost
anything
of
trained
dogs
and
of
dogs
generally
i
can
well
believe
that
the
setter
bitch
spoken
of
by
the
president
punished
her
pup
when
it
flushed
a
bird
she
had
been
punished
herself
for
the
same
offense
but
that
the
act
was
expressive
of
anything
more
than
her
present
anger
that
she
was
in
any
sense
trying
to
train
and
instruct
her
pup
there
is
no
proof
but
with
animals
that
have
not
been
to
school
to
man
all
ideas
of
teaching
must
be
rudimentary
indeed
how
could
a
fox
or
a
wolf
instruct
its
young
in
such
matters
as
traps
only
in
the
presence
of
the
trap
certainly
and
then
the
fear
of
the
trap
would
be
communicated
to
the
young
through
natural
instinct
fear
like
joy
or
curiosity
is
contagious
among
beasts
and
birds
as
it
is
among
men
the
young
fox
or
wolf
would
instantly
share
the
emotion
of
its
parent
in
the
presence
of
a
trap
it
is
very
important
to
the
wild
creatures
that
they
have
a
quick
apprehension
of
danger
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
one
wild
and
suspicious
duck
in
a
flock
will
often
defeat
the
best
laid
plans
of
the
its
suspicions
are
quickly
communicated
to
all
its
fellows
not
through
any
conscious
effort
on
its
part
to
do
so
but
through
the
law
of
natural
contagion
above
referred
to
where
any
bird
or
beast
is
much
hunted
fear
seems
to
be
in
the
air
and
their
fellows
come
to
be
conscious
of
the
danger
which
they
have
not
experienced
what
an
animal
lacks
in
wit
it
makes
up
in
caution
fear
is
a
good
thing
for
the
wild
creatures
to
have
in
superabundance
it
often
saves
them
from
real
danger
but
how
undiscriminating
it
is
it
is
said
that
an
iron
hoop
or
placed
around
a
setting
hen
in
the
woods
will
protect
her
from
the
foxes
animals
are
afraid
on
general
principles
anything
new
and
strange
excites
their
suspicions
in
a
herd
of
animals
cattle
or
horses
fear
quickly
becomes
a
panic
and
rages
like
a
conflagration
cattlemen
in
the
west
found
that
any
little
thing
at
night
might
kindle
the
spark
in
their
herds
and
sweep
the
whole
mass
away
in
a
furious
stampede
each
animal
excites
every
other
and
the
multiplied
fear
of
the
herd
is
something
terrible
panics
among
men
are
not
much
different
in
a
discussion
like
the
present
one
let
us
use
words
in
their
strict
logical
sense
if
possible
most
of
the
current
misconceptions
in
natural
history
as
in
other
matters
arise
from
a
loose
and
careless
use
of
words
one
says
teach
and
train
and
instruct
when
the
facts
point
to
instinctive
imitation
or
unconscious
communication
that
the
young
of
all
kinds
thrive
better
and
develop
more
rapidly
under
the
care
of
their
parents
than
when
deprived
of
that
care
is
obvious
enough
it
would
be
strange
if
it
were
not
so
nothing
can
quite
fill
the
place
of
the
mother
with
either
man
or
bird
or
beast
the
mother
provides
and
protects
the
young
quickly
learn
of
her
through
the
natural
instinct
of
imitation
they
share
her
fears
they
follow
in
her
footsteps
they
look
to
her
for
protection
it
is
the
order
of
nature
they
are
not
trained
in
the
way
they
should
go
as
a
child
is
by
its
human
parents
they
are
not
trained
at
all
but
their
natural
instincts
doubtless
act
more
promptly
and
surely
with
the
mother
than
without
her
that
a
young
kingfisher
or
a
young
osprey
would
in
due
time
dive
for
fish
or
a
young
marsh
hawk
catch
mice
and
birds
or
a
young
fox
or
wolf
or
coon
hunt
for
its
proper
prey
without
the
parental
example
admits
of
no
doubt
at
all
but
they
would
each
probably
do
this
thing
earlier
and
better
in
the
order
of
nature
than
if
that
order
were
interfered
with
the
other
day
i
saw
a
woodpecker
alight
upon
a
decaying
beech
and
proceed
to
drill
for
a
grub
two
of
its
fully
grown
young
followed
it
and
alighting
near
sidled
up
to
where
the
parent
was
drilling
a
hasty
observer
would
say
that
the
parent
was
giving
its
young
a
lesson
in
but
i
read
the
incident
differently
the
parent
bird
had
no
thought
of
its
young
it
made
passes
at
them
when
they
came
too
near
and
drove
them
away
presently
it
left
the
tree
whereupon
one
of
the
young
examined
the
hole
its
parent
had
made
and
drilled
a
little
on
its
own
account
a
parental
example
like
this
may
stimulate
the
young
to
hunt
for
grubs
earlier
than
they
would
otherwise
do
but
this
is
merely
conjecture
there
is
no
proof
of
it
nor
can
there
be
any
the
mother
bird
or
beast
does
not
have
to
be
instructed
in
her
maternal
duties
they
are
instinctive
with
her
it
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
continuance
of
the
species
that
they
should
be
if
it
were
a
matter
of
instruction
or
acquired
knowledge
how
precarious
it
would
be
the
idea
of
teaching
is
an
advanced
idea
and
can
come
only
to
a
being
that
is
capable
of
returning
upon
itself
in
thought
and
that
can
form
abstract
conceptions
conceptions
that
float
free
so
to
speak
dissociated
from
particular
concrete
objects
if
a
fox
or
a
wolf
for
instance
were
capable
of
reflection
and
of
dwelling
upon
the
future
and
upon
the
past
it
might
feel
the
need
of
instructing
its
young
in
the
matter
of
traps
and
hounds
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
without
language
when
the
cat
brings
her
kitten
a
live
mouse
she
is
not
thinking
about
instructing
it
in
the
art
of
dealing
with
mice
but
is
intent
solely
upon
feeding
her
young
the
kitten
already
knows
through
inheritance
about
mice
so
when
the
hen
leads
her
brood
forth
and
scratches
for
them
she
has
but
one
purpose
to
provide
them
with
food
if
she
is
confined
to
the
coop
the
chickens
go
forth
and
soon
scratch
for
themselves
and
snap
up
the
proper
insect
food
the
mother
care
and
protection
count
for
much
but
they
do
not
take
the
place
of
inherited
instinct
it
has
been
found
that
newly
hatched
chickens
when
left
to
themselves
do
not
know
the
difference
between
edible
and
insects
but
that
they
soon
learn
in
such
matters
the
mother
hen
no
doubt
guides
them
a
writer
in
forest
and
stream
who
has
since
published
a
book
about
his
wild
friends
pushes
this
notion
that
animals
train
their
young
so
far
that
it
becomes
grotesque
here
are
some
of
the
things
that
this
keen
observer
and
exposer
of
false
natural
history
reports
that
he
has
seen
about
his
cabin
in
the
woods
he
has
seen
an
old
crow
that
hurriedly
flew
away
from
his
cabin
door
on
his
sudden
appearance
return
and
beat
its
young
because
they
did
not
follow
quickly
enough
he
has
seen
a
male
chewink
while
its
mate
was
rearing
a
second
brood
take
the
first
brood
and
lead
them
away
to
a
he
probably
meant
to
say
to
a
or
kindergarten
and
when
one
of
the
birds
wandered
back
to
take
one
more
view
of
the
scenes
of
its
infancy
he
has
seen
the
father
bird
pounce
upon
it
and
give
it
a
severe
whipping
and
take
it
to
the
resort
again
he
has
seen
swallows
teach
their
young
to
fly
by
gathering
them
upon
fences
and
telegraph
wires
and
then
at
intervals
and
at
the
word
of
command
i
suppose
launching
out
in
the
air
with
them
and
swooping
and
circling
about
he
has
seen
a
song
sparrow
that
came
to
his
dooryard
for
fourteen
years
he
omitted
to
say
that
he
had
branded
him
and
so
knew
his
bird
teach
boy
to
the
italics
are
mine
this
sparrow
wanted
to
desert
the
fields
for
a
life
in
the
woods
but
his
wife
would
not
consent
many
a
featherless
biped
has
had
the
same
experience
with
his
wife
the
puzzle
is
how
did
this
masterly
observer
know
that
this
state
of
affairs
existed
between
this
couple
did
the
wife
tell
him
or
the
husband
hermit
often
takes
his
visitors
to
a
wood
where
as
the
birds
forget
their
lesson
they
drop
out
one
by
one
he
has
seen
an
old
rooster
teaching
a
young
rooster
to
crow
at
first
the
old
rooster
crows
mostly
in
the
morning
but
later
in
the
season
he
crows
throughout
the
day
at
short
intervals
to
show
the
young
the
proper
thing
young
birds
removed
out
of
hearing
will
not
learn
to
crow
he
hears
the
old
grouse
teaching
the
young
to
drum
in
the
fall
though
he
neglects
to
tell
us
that
he
has
seen
the
young
in
attendance
upon
these
lessons
he
has
seen
a
mother
song
sparrow
helping
her
daughter
build
her
nest
he
has
discovered
that
the
cat
talks
to
her
kittens
with
her
ears
when
she
points
them
forward
that
means
yes
when
she
points
them
backward
that
means
no
hence
she
can
tell
them
whether
the
wagon
they
hear
approaching
is
the
butcher
cart
or
not
and
thus
save
them
the
trouble
of
looking
out
and
so
on
through
a
long
list
of
wild
and
domestic
creatures
at
first
i
suspected
this
writer
was
covertly
ridiculing
a
certain
other
extravagant
observer
but
a
careful
reading
of
his
letter
shows
him
to
be
seriously
engaged
in
the
worthy
task
of
exposing
false
natural
history
now
the
singing
of
birds
the
crowing
of
cocks
the
drumming
of
grouse
are
secondary
sexual
characteristics
they
are
not
necessary
to
the
lives
of
the
creatures
and
are
probably
more
influenced
by
imitation
than
are
the
more
important
instincts
of
and
reproduction
yet
the
testimony
is
overwhelming
that
birds
will
sing
and
roosters
crow
and
turkeys
gobble
though
they
have
never
heard
these
sounds
and
no
doubt
the
grouse
and
the
woodpeckers
drum
from
promptings
of
the
same
sexual
instinct
i
do
not
wish
to
accuse
hermit
of
willfully
perverting
the
facts
of
natural
history
he
is
one
of
those
persons
who
read
their
own
fancies
into
whatever
they
look
upon
he
is
incapable
of
disinterested
observation
which
means
he
is
incapable
of
observation
at
all
in
the
true
sense
there
are
no
animals
that
signal
to
each
other
with
their
ears
the
movements
of
the
ears
follow
the
movements
of
the
eye
when
an
animal
attention
is
directed
to
any
object
or
sound
its
ears
point
forward
when
its
attention
is
relaxed
the
ears
fall
but
with
the
cat
tribe
the
ears
are
habitually
erect
as
those
of
the
horse
are
usually
relaxed
they
depress
them
and
revert
them
as
do
many
other
animals
when
angered
or
afraid
certain
things
in
animal
life
lead
me
to
suspect
that
animals
have
some
means
of
communication
with
one
another
especially
the
gregarious
animals
that
is
quite
independent
of
what
we
mean
by
language
it
is
like
an
interchange
or
blending
of
subconscious
states
and
may
be
analogous
to
telepathy
among
human
beings
observe
what
a
unit
a
flock
of
birds
becomes
when
performing
their
evolutions
in
the
air
they
are
not
many
but
one
turning
and
flashing
in
the
sun
with
a
unity
and
a
precision
that
it
would
be
hard
to
imitate
one
may
see
a
flock
of
that
behave
as
one
body
now
they
turn
to
the
sun
a
sheet
of
silver
then
as
their
dark
backs
are
presented
to
the
beholder
they
almost
disappear
against
the
shore
or
the
clouds
it
would
seem
as
if
they
shared
in
a
communal
mind
or
spirit
and
that
what
one
felt
they
all
felt
at
the
same
instant
in
florida
i
many
times
saw
large
schools
of
mullets
fretting
and
breaking
the
surface
of
the
water
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
tips
of
their
tails
a
large
area
would
be
agitated
and
rippled
by
the
backs
or
tails
of
a
host
of
fishes
then
suddenly
while
i
looked
there
would
be
one
splash
and
every
fish
would
dive
it
was
a
multitude
again
acting
as
one
body
hundreds
thousands
of
tails
slapped
the
water
at
the
same
instant
and
were
gone
when
the
passenger
pigeons
were
numbered
by
millions
the
enormous
clans
used
to
migrate
from
one
part
of
the
continent
to
another
i
saw
the
last
flight
of
them
up
the
hudson
river
valley
in
the
spring
of
all
day
they
streamed
across
the
sky
one
purpose
seemed
to
animate
every
flock
and
every
bird
it
was
as
if
all
had
orders
to
move
to
the
same
point
the
pigeons
came
only
when
there
was
in
the
woods
how
did
they
know
we
had
had
a
year
it
is
true
that
a
few
straggling
bands
were
usually
seen
some
days
in
advance
of
the
blue
myriads
were
these
the
scouts
and
did
they
return
with
the
news
of
the
if
so
how
did
they
communicate
the
intelligence
and
set
the
whole
mighty
army
in
motion
the
migrations
among
the
animals
that
sometimes
occur
over
a
large
part
of
the
country
among
the
rats
the
gray
squirrels
the
reindeer
of
the
north
seem
to
be
of
a
similar
character
how
does
every
individual
come
to
share
in
the
common
purpose
an
army
of
men
attempting
to
move
without
leaders
and
without
a
written
or
spoken
language
becomes
a
disorganized
mob
not
so
the
animals
there
seems
to
be
a
community
of
mind
among
them
in
a
sense
that
there
is
not
among
men
the
pressure
of
great
danger
seems
to
develop
in
a
degree
this
community
of
mind
and
feeling
among
men
under
strong
excitement
we
revert
more
or
less
to
the
animal
state
and
are
ruled
by
instinct
it
may
well
be
that
telepathy
the
power
to
project
one
mental
or
emotional
state
so
as
to
impress
a
friend
at
a
distance
is
a
power
which
we
have
carried
over
from
our
remote
animal
ancestors
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
sensitiveness
of
birds
and
quadrupeds
to
the
condition
of
one
another
their
sense
of
a
common
danger
of
food
supplies
of
the
direction
of
home
under
all
circumstances
point
to
the
possession
of
a
power
which
is
only
rudimentary
in
us
some
observers
explain
these
things
on
the
theory
that
the
flocks
of
birds
have
leaders
and
that
their
surprising
evolutions
are
guided
by
calls
or
signals
from
these
leaders
too
quick
or
too
fine
for
our
eyes
or
ears
to
catch
i
suppose
they
would
explain
the
movements
of
the
schools
of
fish
and
the
simultaneous
movements
of
a
large
number
of
land
animals
on
the
same
theory
i
can
not
accept
this
explanation
it
is
harder
for
me
to
believe
that
a
flock
of
birds
has
a
code
of
calls
or
signals
for
all
its
evolutions
now
right
now
left
now
mount
now
swoop
which
each
individual
understands
on
the
instant
or
that
the
hosts
of
the
wild
pigeons
had
their
captains
and
signals
than
to
believe
that
out
of
the
flocking
instinct
there
has
grown
some
other
instinct
or
faculty
less
understood
but
equally
potent
that
puts
all
the
members
of
a
flock
in
such
complete
rapport
with
one
another
that
the
purpose
and
the
desire
of
one
become
the
purpose
and
the
desire
of
all
there
is
nothing
in
this
state
of
things
analogous
to
a
military
organization
the
relation
among
the
members
of
the
flock
is
rather
that
of
creatures
sharing
spontaneously
the
same
subconscious
or
psychic
state
and
acted
upon
by
the
same
hidden
influence
in
a
way
and
to
a
degree
that
never
occur
among
men
the
faculty
or
power
by
which
animals
find
the
way
home
over
or
across
long
stretches
of
country
is
quite
as
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
to
us
as
the
spirit
of
the
flock
to
which
i
refer
a
hive
of
bees
evidently
has
a
collective
purpose
and
plan
that
does
not
emanate
from
any
single
individual
or
group
of
individuals
and
which
is
understood
by
all
without
outward
communication
is
there
anything
which
without
great
violence
to
language
may
be
called
a
school
of
the
woods
in
the
sense
in
which
a
playground
is
a
school
a
playground
without
rules
or
methods
or
a
director
there
is
a
school
of
the
woods
it
is
an
unkept
an
unconscious
school
or
gymnasium
and
is
entirely
instinctive
in
play
the
young
of
all
animals
no
doubt
get
a
certain
amount
of
training
and
disciplining
that
helps
fit
them
for
their
future
careers
but
this
school
is
not
presided
over
or
directed
by
parents
though
they
sometimes
take
part
in
it
it
is
spontaneous
and
haphazard
without
rule
or
system
but
is
in
every
case
along
the
line
of
the
future
struggle
for
life
of
the
particular
bird
or
animal
a
young
marsh
hawk
which
we
reared
used
to
play
at
striking
leaves
or
bits
of
bark
with
its
talons
kittens
play
with
a
ball
or
a
cob
or
a
stick
as
if
it
were
a
mouse
dogs
race
and
wrestle
with
one
another
as
in
the
chase
ducks
dive
and
sport
in
the
water
doves
circle
and
dive
in
the
air
as
if
escaping
from
a
hawk
birds
pursue
and
dodge
one
another
in
the
same
way
bears
wrestle
and
box
chickens
have
mimic
battles
colts
run
and
leap
fawns
probably
do
the
same
thing
squirrels
play
something
like
a
game
of
tag
in
the
trees
lambs
butt
one
another
and
skip
about
the
rocks
and
so
on
in
fact
nearly
all
play
including
much
of
that
of
man
takes
the
form
of
mock
battle
and
is
to
that
extent
an
education
for
the
future
among
the
carnivora
it
takes
also
the
form
of
the
chase
its
spring
and
motive
are
of
course
pleasure
and
not
education
and
herein
again
is
revealed
the
cunning
of
nature
the
power
that
conceals
purposes
of
its
own
in
our
most
thoughtless
acts
the
cat
and
the
kitten
play
with
the
live
mouse
not
to
indulge
the
sense
of
cruelty
as
some
have
supposed
but
to
indulge
in
the
pleasure
of
the
chase
and
unconsciously
to
practice
the
feat
of
capture
the
cat
rarely
plays
with
a
live
bird
because
the
recapture
would
be
more
difficult
and
might
fail
what
fisherman
would
not
like
to
take
his
big
fish
over
and
over
again
if
he
could
be
sure
of
doing
it
not
from
cruelty
but
for
the
pleasure
of
practicing
his
art
for
further
light
on
the
subject
of
the
significance
of
the
play
of
animals
i
refer
the
reader
to
the
work
of
professor
karl
groos
called
the
play
of
animals
one
of
my
critics
has
accused
me
of
measuring
all
things
by
the
standard
of
my
little
farm
of
thinking
that
what
is
not
true
of
animal
life
there
is
not
true
anywhere
unfortunately
my
farm
small
hardly
a
score
of
acres
and
its
animal
life
very
limited
i
have
never
seen
even
a
porcupine
upon
it
but
i
have
a
hill
where
one
might
roll
down
should
one
ever
come
my
way
and
be
in
the
mood
for
that
kind
of
play
i
have
a
few
possums
a
woodchuck
or
two
an
occasional
skunk
some
red
squirrels
and
rabbits
and
many
kinds
of
foxes
occasionally
cross
my
acres
and
once
at
least
i
saw
a
bald
eagle
devouring
a
fish
in
one
of
my
wild
ducks
geese
and
swans
in
spring
and
fall
pass
across
the
sky
above
me
quail
and
grouse
invade
my
premises
and
of
crows
i
have
at
least
in
time
too
many
see
comment
on
the
story
here
alluded
to
on
page
but
i
have
a
few
times
climbed
over
my
pasture
wall
and
wandered
into
distant
fields
once
upon
a
time
i
was
a
traveler
in
asia
for
the
space
of
two
hours
an
experience
that
ought
to
have
yielded
me
some
startling
discoveries
but
did
not
indeed
the
wider
i
have
traveled
and
observed
nature
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
the
wild
creatures
behave
just
about
the
same
in
all
parts
of
the
country
that
is
under
similar
conditions
what
one
observes
truly
about
bird
or
beast
upon
his
farm
of
ten
acres
he
will
not
have
to
unlearn
travel
as
wide
or
as
far
as
he
will
where
the
animals
are
much
hunted
they
are
of
course
much
wilder
and
more
cunning
than
where
they
are
not
hunted
in
the
yellowstone
national
park
we
found
the
elk
deer
and
mountain
sheep
singularly
tame
and
in
the
summer
so
we
were
told
the
bears
board
at
the
big
hotels
the
wild
geese
and
ducks
too
were
tame
and
the
hawk
built
its
nest
in
a
large
dead
oak
that
stood
quite
alone
near
the
side
of
the
road
with
us
the
same
hawk
hides
its
nest
in
a
tree
in
the
dense
woods
because
the
farmers
unwisely
hunt
and
destroy
it
but
the
cougars
and
coyotes
and
bobcats
were
no
tamer
in
the
park
than
they
are
in
other
places
where
they
are
hunted
indeed
if
i
had
elk
and
deer
and
caribou
and
moose
and
bears
and
wildcats
and
beavers
and
otters
and
porcupines
on
my
farm
i
should
expect
them
to
behave
just
as
they
do
in
other
parts
of
the
country
under
like
conditions
they
would
be
tame
and
docile
if
i
did
not
molest
them
and
wild
and
fierce
if
i
did
they
would
do
nothing
out
of
character
in
either
case
your
natural
history
knowledge
of
the
east
will
avail
you
in
the
west
there
is
no
country
says
emerson
in
which
they
do
not
wash
the
pans
and
spank
the
babies
and
there
is
no
country
where
a
dog
is
not
a
dog
or
a
fox
a
fox
or
where
a
hare
is
ferocious
or
a
wolf
lamblike
the
porcupine
behaves
in
the
rockies
just
as
he
does
in
the
catskills
the
deer
and
the
moose
and
the
black
bear
and
the
beaver
of
the
pacific
slope
are
almost
identical
in
their
habits
and
traits
with
those
of
the
atlantic
slope
in
my
observations
of
the
birds
of
the
far
west
i
went
wrong
in
my
reckoning
but
once
the
western
meadowlark
has
a
new
song
how
or
where
he
got
it
is
a
mystery
it
seems
to
be
in
some
way
the
gift
of
those
great
smooth
flowery
treeless
dimpled
hills
but
the
swallow
was
familiar
and
the
robin
and
the
wren
and
the
highhole
while
the
woodchuck
i
saw
and
heard
in
wyoming
might
have
been
the
chuck
of
my
native
hills
the
eagle
is
an
eagle
the
world
over
when
i
was
a
boy
i
saw
one
autumn
day
an
eagle
descend
with
extended
talons
upon
the
backs
of
a
herd
of
young
cattle
that
were
accompanied
by
a
and
were
feeding
upon
a
high
hill
the
object
of
the
eagle
seemed
to
be
to
separate
the
one
sheep
from
the
cattle
or
to
frighten
them
all
into
breaking
their
necks
in
trying
to
escape
him
but
neither
result
did
he
achieve
in
the
yellowstone
park
president
roosevelt
and
major
pitcher
saw
a
golden
eagle
trying
the
same
tactics
upon
a
herd
of
elk
that
contained
one
yearling
the
eagle
doubtless
had
his
eye
upon
the
yearling
though
he
would
probably
have
been
quite
satisfied
to
have
driven
one
of
the
older
ones
down
a
precipice
his
chances
of
a
dinner
would
have
been
equally
good
there
is
one
particular
in
which
the
bird
families
are
much
more
human
than
our
kindred
i
refer
to
the
practice
of
courtship
the
male
of
all
birds
so
far
as
i
know
pays
suit
to
the
female
and
seeks
to
please
and
attract
her
this
the
quadrupeds
do
not
do
there
is
no
period
of
courtship
among
them
and
no
mating
or
pairing
as
among
the
birds
the
male
fights
for
the
female
but
he
does
not
seek
to
win
her
by
delicate
attentions
if
there
are
any
exceptions
to
this
rule
i
do
not
know
them
there
seems
to
be
among
the
birds
something
that
is
like
what
is
called
romantic
love
the
choice
of
mate
seems
always
to
rest
with
the
female
while
among
the
mammals
the
female
shows
no
preference
at
all
except
in
the
case
of
certain
birds
of
india
and
australia
among
our
own
birds
the
prettiest
thing
i
know
of
attending
the
period
of
courtship
or
preliminary
to
the
is
the
spring
musical
festival
and
reunion
of
the
goldfinches
which
often
lasts
for
days
through
rain
and
shine
in
april
or
may
apparently
all
the
goldfinches
from
a
large
area
collect
in
the
top
of
an
elm
or
a
maple
and
unite
in
a
prolonged
musical
festival
is
it
a
contest
among
the
males
for
the
favor
of
the
females
or
is
it
the
spontaneous
expression
of
the
gladness
of
the
whole
clan
at
the
return
of
the
season
of
life
and
love
the
birds
seem
to
pair
soon
after
and
doubtless
the
concert
of
voices
has
some
reference
to
that
event
there
is
one
other
human
practice
often
attributed
to
the
lower
animals
that
i
must
briefly
consider
and
that
is
the
practice
under
certain
circumstances
of
poisoning
their
young
one
often
hears
of
caged
young
birds
being
fed
by
their
parents
for
a
few
days
and
then
poisoned
or
of
a
mother
fox
poisoning
her
captive
young
when
she
finds
that
she
can
not
liberate
him
and
such
stories
obtain
ready
credence
with
the
public
especially
with
the
young
to
make
these
stories
credible
one
must
suppose
a
school
of
pharmacy
too
in
the
woods
the
worst
thing
about
these
poisoning
stories
writes
a
friend
of
mine
himself
a
writer
of
is
the
implied
appreciation
of
the
full
effect
and
object
of
poison
the
comprehension
by
the
fox
for
instance
that
the
poisoned
meat
she
may
be
supposed
to
find
was
placed
there
for
the
object
of
killing
herself
or
some
other
fox
and
that
she
may
apply
it
to
another
animal
for
that
purpose
furthermore
that
she
understands
the
nature
of
death
that
it
brings
of
sorrow
and
that
death
is
better
than
captivity
for
her
young
one
how
did
she
acquire
all
this
knowledge
where
was
her
experience
of
its
supposed
truth
obtained
how
could
she
make
so
fine
and
a
judgment
wholly
out
of
the
range
of
brute
affairs
and
so
purely
philosophical
and
humanly
ethical
it
violates
every
instinct
and
canon
of
natural
law
which
is
for
the
preservation
of
life
at
all
hazards
this
is
simply
the
human
idea
of
animals
kill
one
another
for
food
or
in
rivalry
or
in
blind
ferocity
of
predatory
disposition
but
there
is
not
a
particle
of
evidence
that
they
murder
for
ulterior
ends
it
is
questionable
whether
they
comprehend
the
condition
called
death
or
its
nature
in
any
proper
sense
on
another
occasion
i
laughed
at
a
recent
nature
writer
for
his
credulity
in
the
story
told
him
by
a
fisherman
that
the
fox
catches
crabs
by
using
his
tail
as
a
bait
and
yet
i
read
in
romanes
that
olaus
in
his
account
of
norway
says
he
has
seen
a
fox
do
this
very
thing
among
the
rocks
on
the
one
would
like
to
olaus
before
accepting
such
a
statement
one
would
as
soon
expect
a
fox
to
put
his
brush
in
the
fire
as
in
the
water
when
it
becomes
wet
and
bedraggled
he
is
greatly
handicapped
as
to
speed
there
is
no
doubt
that
rats
will
put
their
tails
into
jars
that
contain
liquid
food
they
want
and
then
lick
them
off
as
romanes
proved
but
the
rat
tail
is
not
a
brush
nor
in
any
sense
an
ornament
think
what
the
story
implies
now
the
fox
is
entirely
a
land
animal
and
lives
by
preying
upon
land
creatures
which
it
follows
by
scent
or
sight
it
can
neither
see
nor
smell
crabs
in
the
deep
water
where
crabs
are
usually
found
how
should
it
know
that
there
are
such
things
as
crabs
how
should
it
know
that
they
can
be
taken
with
bait
and
line
or
by
fishing
for
them
when
and
how
did
it
get
this
experience
this
knowledge
belongs
to
man
alone
it
comes
through
a
process
of
reasoning
that
he
alone
is
capable
of
man
alone
of
land
animals
sets
traps
and
fishes
there
is
a
fish
called
the
angler
which
it
is
said
on
doubtful
authority
by
means
of
some
sort
of
appendages
on
its
head
angles
for
small
fish
but
no
competent
observer
has
reported
any
land
animal
doing
so
again
would
a
crab
lay
hold
of
a
mass
of
fur
like
a
tail
even
if
the
tail
could
be
thrust
deep
enough
into
the
water
which
is
impossible
crabs
when
not
caught
with
are
usually
taken
in
water
eight
or
ten
feet
deep
they
are
baited
and
caught
with
a
piece
of
meat
tied
to
a
string
but
can
not
be
lifted
to
the
surface
till
they
are
eating
the
meat
and
then
a
is
required
to
secure
them
the
story
on
the
whole
is
one
of
the
most
preposterous
that
ever
gained
credence
in
natural
history
a
book
published
in
london
in
entitled
geographical
historical
and
commercial
grammar
and
the
present
state
of
the
several
kingdoms
of
the
among
other
astonishing
natural
history
notes
makes
this
statement
about
the
white
and
red
fox
of
norway
they
have
a
particular
way
of
drawing
crabs
ashore
by
dipping
their
tails
in
the
water
which
the
crab
lays
hold
of
good
observers
are
probably
about
as
rare
as
good
poets
accurate
seeing
an
eye
that
takes
in
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
how
rare
indeed
it
is
so
few
persons
know
or
can
tell
exactly
what
they
see
so
few
persons
can
draw
a
right
inference
from
an
observed
fact
so
few
persons
can
keep
from
reading
their
own
thoughts
and
preconceptions
into
what
they
see
only
a
person
with
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
can
be
trusted
to
report
things
as
they
are
most
of
us
in
observing
the
wild
life
about
us
see
more
or
see
less
than
the
truth
we
see
less
when
our
minds
are
dull
or
preoccupied
or
blunted
by
want
of
interest
this
is
true
of
most
country
people
we
see
more
when
we
read
the
lives
of
the
wild
creatures
about
us
in
the
light
of
our
human
experience
and
impute
to
the
birds
and
beasts
human
motives
and
methods
this
is
too
often
true
of
the
eager
city
man
or
woman
who
sallies
out
into
the
country
to
study
nature
the
tendency
to
sentimentalize
nature
has
in
our
time
largely
taken
the
place
of
the
old
tendency
to
demonize
and
spiritize
it
it
is
anthropomorphism
in
another
form
less
fraught
with
evil
to
us
but
equally
in
the
way
of
a
clear
understanding
of
the
life
about
us
vii
devious
paths
there
is
no
better
type
or
epitome
of
wild
nature
than
the
something
built
and
yet
as
if
it
grew
a
part
of
the
ground
or
of
the
rock
or
of
the
branch
upon
which
it
is
placed
beginning
so
coarsely
so
irregularly
and
ending
so
finely
and
symmetrically
so
unlike
the
work
of
hands
and
yet
the
result
of
a
skill
beyond
hands
and
when
it
holds
its
complement
of
eggs
how
pleasing
how
suggestive
the
bird
adapts
means
to
an
end
and
yet
so
differently
from
the
way
of
man
an
end
of
which
it
does
not
know
the
value
or
the
purpose
we
know
it
is
prompted
to
it
by
the
instinct
of
reproduction
when
the
woodpecker
in
the
fall
excavates
a
lodge
in
a
dry
limb
we
know
he
is
prompted
to
it
by
the
instinct
of
but
the
birds
themselves
obey
the
behests
of
nature
without
knowledge
a
suggests
design
and
yet
it
seems
almost
haphazard
the
result
of
a
kind
of
madness
yet
with
method
in
it
the
hole
the
woodpecker
drills
for
its
cell
is
to
the
eye
a
perfect
circle
and
the
rim
of
most
nests
is
as
true
as
that
of
a
cup
the
circle
and
the
sphere
exist
in
nature
they
are
mother
forms
and
hold
all
other
forms
they
are
easily
attained
they
are
spontaneous
and
inevitable
the
bird
models
her
nest
about
her
own
breast
she
turns
round
and
round
in
it
and
its
circular
character
results
as
a
matter
of
course
angles
right
lines
measured
precision
so
characteristic
of
the
works
of
man
are
rarely
met
with
in
organic
nature
nature
reaches
her
ends
by
devious
paths
she
loiters
she
meanders
she
plays
by
the
way
she
surely
arrives
but
it
is
always
in
a
blind
hesitating
experimental
kind
of
fashion
follow
the
tunnels
of
the
ants
or
the
crickets
or
of
the
moles
and
the
weasels
underground
or
the
courses
of
the
streams
or
the
paths
of
the
animals
above
ground
how
they
turn
and
hesitate
how
wayward
and
undecided
they
are
a
right
line
seems
out
of
the
question
the
oriole
often
weaves
strings
into
her
nest
sometimes
she
binds
and
overhands
the
part
of
the
rim
where
she
alights
in
going
in
to
make
it
stronger
but
it
is
always
done
in
a
childish
sort
of
way
as
one
would
expect
it
to
be
the
strings
are
massed
or
snarled
or
left
dangling
at
loose
ends
or
are
caught
around
branches
the
weaving
and
the
sewing
are
effective
and
the
whole
nest
is
a
marvel
of
blind
skill
of
untaught
intelligence
yet
how
unmethodical
how
delightfully
irregular
how
unmistakably
a
piece
of
wild
nature
sometimes
the
instinct
of
the
bird
is
tardy
and
the
egg
of
the
bird
gets
ripe
before
the
nest
is
ready
in
such
a
case
the
egg
is
of
course
lost
i
once
found
the
nest
of
the
black
and
white
creeping
warbler
in
a
mossy
bank
in
the
woods
and
under
the
nest
was
an
egg
of
the
bird
the
warbler
had
excavated
the
site
for
her
nest
dropped
her
egg
into
it
and
then
gone
on
with
her
building
instinct
is
not
always
inerrant
nature
is
wasteful
and
plays
the
game
with
a
free
hand
yet
what
she
loses
on
one
side
she
gains
on
another
she
is
like
that
least
bittern
frank
chapman
tells
about
two
of
the
bittern
five
eggs
had
been
punctured
by
the
marsh
wren
when
the
bird
returned
to
her
nest
and
found
the
two
eggs
punctured
she
made
no
outcry
showed
no
emotion
but
deliberately
proceeded
to
eat
them
having
done
this
she
dropped
the
empty
shells
over
the
side
of
the
nest
together
with
any
straws
that
had
become
soiled
in
the
process
cleaned
her
bill
and
proceeded
with
her
incubation
this
was
nature
in
a
or
rather
turning
her
mishaps
to
some
good
account
if
the
egg
will
not
make
a
bird
it
will
make
food
if
not
food
then
fertilizer
among
nearly
all
our
birds
the
female
is
the
active
business
member
of
the
partnership
she
has
a
turn
for
practical
affairs
she
chooses
the
site
of
the
nest
and
usually
builds
it
unaided
the
life
of
the
male
is
more
or
less
a
holiday
or
picnic
till
the
young
are
hatched
when
his
real
cares
begin
for
he
does
his
part
in
feeding
them
one
may
see
the
male
attending
the
female
as
she
is
busy
with
her
but
never
so
far
as
i
have
observed
assisting
her
one
spring
i
observed
with
much
interest
a
building
her
nest
not
far
from
my
cabin
in
the
woods
the
male
looked
on
approvingly
but
did
not
help
he
perched
most
of
the
time
on
a
mullein
stalk
near
the
little
spring
run
where
phoebe
came
for
mud
in
the
early
morning
hours
she
made
her
trips
at
intervals
of
a
minute
or
two
the
male
flirted
his
tail
and
called
encouragingly
and
when
she
started
up
the
hill
with
her
load
he
would
accompany
her
part
way
to
help
her
over
the
steepest
part
as
it
were
then
return
to
his
perch
and
watch
and
call
for
her
return
for
an
hour
or
more
i
witnessed
this
little
play
in
bird
life
in
which
the
female
part
was
so
primary
and
the
male
so
secondary
there
is
something
in
such
things
that
seems
to
lend
support
to
professor
lester
contention
as
set
forth
in
his
pure
sociology
that
in
the
natural
evolution
of
the
two
sexes
the
female
was
first
and
the
male
second
that
he
was
made
from
her
rib
so
to
speak
and
not
she
from
his
with
our
phalarope
and
a
few
australian
birds
the
position
of
the
two
sexes
as
indicated
above
is
reversed
the
females
having
the
ornaments
and
bright
colors
and
doing
the
courting
while
the
male
does
the
incubating
in
a
few
cases
also
the
female
is
much
the
more
masculine
noisy
and
pugnacious
with
some
of
our
common
birds
such
as
the
woodpeckers
the
chickadee
and
the
swallows
both
sexes
take
part
in
it
is
a
very
pretty
sight
to
witness
a
pair
of
wood
thrushes
building
their
nest
indeed
what
is
there
about
the
wood
thrush
that
is
not
pleasing
he
is
a
kind
of
visible
embodied
melody
some
birds
are
so
sharp
and
nervous
and
emphatic
in
their
movements
as
the
common
snowbird
or
junco
the
flashing
of
whose
white
tail
quills
expresses
the
character
of
the
bird
but
all
the
ways
of
the
wood
thrush
are
smooth
and
gentle
and
suggest
the
melody
of
its
song
it
is
the
only
bird
thief
i
love
to
see
carrying
off
my
cherries
it
usually
takes
only
those
dropped
upon
the
ground
by
other
birds
and
with
the
red
or
golden
globe
impaled
upon
its
beak
its
flight
across
the
lawn
is
a
picture
delightful
to
behold
one
season
a
pair
of
them
built
a
nest
in
a
grove
morning
after
morning
for
many
mornings
i
used
to
see
the
two
going
to
and
from
the
nest
over
my
vineyard
and
currant
patch
and
pear
orchard
in
quest
of
or
bringing
material
for
the
structure
they
flew
low
the
female
in
the
lead
the
male
just
behind
in
line
with
her
timing
his
motions
to
hers
the
two
making
a
brown
gently
undulating
line
very
pretty
to
look
upon
from
my
neighbor
field
where
they
obtained
the
material
to
the
tree
that
held
the
nest
a
gentle
gliding
flight
hurried
but
hushed
as
it
were
and
expressive
of
privacy
and
loving
preoccupation
the
male
carried
no
material
apparently
he
was
simply
the
escort
of
his
mate
but
he
had
an
air
of
keen
and
joyous
interest
he
never
failed
to
attend
her
each
way
keeping
about
a
yard
behind
her
and
flying
as
if
her
thought
were
his
thought
and
her
wish
his
wish
i
have
rarely
seen
anything
so
pretty
in
bird
life
the
movements
of
all
our
thrushes
except
the
robin
give
one
this
same
sense
of
harmony
nothing
sharp
or
angular
or
abrupt
their
gestures
are
as
pleasing
as
their
notes
one
evening
while
seated
upon
my
porch
i
had
convincing
proof
that
musical
or
song
contests
do
take
place
among
the
birds
two
wood
thrashes
who
had
nests
near
by
sat
on
the
top
of
a
dead
tree
and
pitted
themselves
against
each
other
in
song
for
over
half
an
hour
contending
like
champions
in
a
game
and
certainly
affording
the
rarest
treat
in
wood
thrush
melody
i
had
ever
had
they
sang
and
sang
with
unwearied
spirit
and
persistence
now
and
then
changing
position
or
facing
in
another
direction
but
keeping
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
the
rivalry
became
so
obvious
and
was
so
interesting
that
i
finally
made
it
a
point
not
to
take
my
eyes
from
the
singers
the
twilight
deepened
till
their
forms
began
to
grow
dim
then
one
of
the
birds
could
stand
the
strain
no
longer
the
limit
of
fair
competition
had
been
reached
and
seeming
to
say
i
will
silence
you
anyhow
it
made
a
spiteful
dive
at
its
rival
and
in
hot
pursuit
the
two
disappeared
in
the
bushes
beneath
the
tree
of
course
i
would
not
say
that
the
birds
were
consciously
striving
to
outdo
each
other
in
song
it
was
the
old
feud
between
males
in
the
love
season
not
a
war
of
words
or
of
blows
but
of
song
had
the
birds
been
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
the
rivalry
would
probably
have
taken
the
form
of
strutting
and
showing
off
their
bright
colors
and
ornaments
an
english
writer
on
birds
edmund
selous
describes
a
similar
song
contest
between
two
nightingales
jealousy
he
says
did
not
seem
to
blind
them
to
the
merit
of
each
other
performance
though
often
one
upon
hearing
the
sweet
hostile
strains
would
burst
forth
instantly
itself
and
here
there
was
no
certain
mark
of
appreciation
yet
sometimes
perhaps
quite
as
often
it
would
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
listen
with
exactly
the
appearance
of
a
musical
connoisseur
weighing
testing
and
appraising
each
note
as
it
issued
from
the
rival
bill
a
curious
expression
would
steal
or
seem
to
steal
for
fancy
may
play
her
part
in
such
matters
over
the
listening
bird
and
the
idea
appear
to
be
exquisite
would
be
those
strains
were
they
not
sung
by
and
yet
i
must
admit
that
they
are
exquisite
fancy
no
doubt
does
play
a
part
in
such
matters
it
may
well
be
doubted
if
birds
are
musical
connoisseurs
or
have
anything
like
human
appreciation
of
their
own
or
of
each
other
songs
my
reason
for
thinking
so
is
this
i
have
heard
a
bobolink
with
an
instrument
so
defective
that
its
song
was
broken
and
inarticulate
in
parts
and
yet
it
sang
with
as
much
apparent
joy
and
abandon
as
any
of
its
fellows
i
have
also
heard
a
hermit
thrush
with
a
similar
defect
or
impediment
that
appeared
to
sing
entirely
to
its
own
satisfaction
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
know
if
these
poor
singers
found
mates
as
readily
as
their
more
gifted
brothers
if
they
did
the
darwinian
theory
of
sexual
selection
in
such
matters
according
to
which
the
finer
songster
would
carry
off
the
female
would
fall
to
the
ground
yet
it
is
certain
that
it
is
during
the
mating
and
breeding
season
that
these
song
combats
occur
and
the
favor
of
the
female
would
seem
to
be
the
matter
in
dispute
whether
or
not
it
be
expressive
of
actual
jealousy
or
rivalry
we
have
no
other
words
to
apply
to
it
a
good
deal
of
light
is
thrown
upon
the
ways
of
nature
as
seen
in
the
lives
of
our
solitary
wasps
so
skillfully
and
charmingly
depicted
by
george
peckham
and
his
wife
in
their
work
on
those
insects
so
whimsical
so
fickle
so
forgetful
so
fussy
so
wise
and
yet
so
foolish
as
these
little
people
are
such
victims
of
routine
and
yet
so
individual
such
apparent
foresight
and
yet
such
thoughtlessness
at
such
great
pains
and
labor
to
dig
a
hole
and
build
a
cell
and
then
at
times
sealing
it
up
without
storing
it
with
food
or
laying
the
egg
half
finishing
hole
after
hole
and
then
abandoning
them
without
any
apparent
reason
sometimes
killing
their
spiders
at
other
times
only
paralyzing
them
one
species
digging
its
burrow
before
it
captures
its
game
others
capturing
the
game
and
then
digging
the
hole
some
of
them
hanging
the
spider
up
in
the
fork
of
a
weed
to
keep
it
away
from
the
ants
while
they
work
at
their
nest
and
running
to
it
every
few
minutes
to
see
that
it
is
safe
others
laying
the
insect
on
the
ground
while
they
dig
one
species
walking
backward
and
dragging
its
spider
after
it
and
when
the
spider
is
so
small
that
it
carries
it
in
its
mandible
still
walking
backward
as
if
dragging
it
when
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
walk
forward
a
curious
little
people
leading
their
solitary
lives
and
greatly
differentiated
by
the
solitude
hardly
any
two
alike
one
nervous
and
excitable
another
calm
and
unhurried
one
careless
in
her
work
another
neat
and
thorough
this
one
suspicious
that
one
confiding
ammophila
using
a
pebble
to
pack
down
the
earth
in
her
burrow
while
another
species
uses
the
end
of
her
abdomen
verily
a
queer
little
people
with
a
lot
of
wild
nature
about
them
and
a
lot
of
human
nature
too
i
think
one
can
see
how
this
development
of
individuality
among
the
solitary
wasps
comes
about
may
it
not
be
because
the
wasps
are
solitary
they
live
alone
they
have
no
one
to
imitate
they
are
uninfluenced
by
their
fellows
no
community
interests
override
or
check
individual
whims
or
peculiarities
the
innate
tendency
to
variation
active
in
all
forms
of
life
has
with
them
full
sway
among
the
social
bees
or
wasps
one
would
not
expect
to
find
those
differences
between
individuals
the
members
of
a
colony
all
appear
alike
in
habits
and
in
dispositions
colonies
differ
as
every
knows
but
probably
the
members
composing
it
differ
very
little
the
community
interests
shape
all
alike
is
it
not
the
same
in
a
degree
among
men
does
not
solitude
bring
out
a
man
peculiarities
and
differentiate
him
from
others
the
more
one
lives
alone
the
more
he
becomes
unlike
his
fellows
hence
the
original
and
racy
flavor
of
woodsmen
pioneers
lone
dwellers
in
nature
solitudes
thus
isolated
communities
develop
characteristics
of
their
own
constant
intercommunication
the
friction
of
travel
of
streets
of
books
of
newspapers
make
us
all
alike
we
are
as
it
were
all
pebbles
upon
the
same
shore
washed
by
the
same
waves
among
the
larger
of
vertebrate
animals
i
think
one
might
reasonably
expect
to
find
more
individuality
among
those
that
are
solitary
than
among
those
that
are
gregarious
more
among
birds
of
prey
than
among
more
among
foxes
than
among
more
among
moose
than
among
sheep
or
buffalo
more
among
grouse
than
among
quail
but
i
do
not
know
that
this
is
true
yet
among
none
of
these
would
one
expect
to
find
the
diversity
of
individual
types
that
one
finds
among
men
no
two
dogs
of
the
same
breed
will
be
found
to
differ
as
two
men
of
the
same
family
often
differ
an
original
fox
or
wolf
or
bear
or
beaver
or
crow
or
crab
that
is
one
not
merely
different
from
his
fellows
but
obviously
superior
to
them
differing
from
them
as
a
master
mind
differs
from
the
ordinary
mind
i
think
one
need
not
expect
to
find
it
is
quite
legitimate
for
the
writer
to
make
the
most
of
the
individual
differences
in
habits
and
disposition
among
the
animals
he
has
the
same
latitude
any
other
story
writer
has
but
he
is
bound
also
by
the
same
law
of
probability
the
same
need
of
fidelity
to
nature
if
he
proceed
upon
the
theory
that
the
wild
creatures
have
as
pronounced
individuality
as
men
have
that
there
are
master
minds
among
them
inventors
and
discoverers
of
new
ways
born
captains
and
heroes
he
will
surely
the
modesty
of
nature
the
great
diversity
of
character
and
capacity
among
men
doubtless
arises
from
their
greater
and
more
complex
needs
relations
and
aspirations
the
animals
needs
in
comparison
are
few
their
relations
simple
and
their
aspirations
one
can
not
see
what
could
give
rise
to
the
individual
types
and
exceptional
endowments
that
are
often
claimed
for
them
the
law
of
variation
as
i
have
said
would
give
rise
to
differences
but
not
to
a
sudden
reversal
of
race
habits
or
to
animal
geniuses
the
law
of
variation
is
everywhere
operative
less
so
now
no
doubt
than
in
the
earlier
history
of
organic
life
on
the
globe
yet
nature
is
still
experimenting
in
her
blind
way
and
hits
upon
many
curious
differences
and
departures
but
i
suppose
if
the
race
of
man
were
exterminated
man
would
never
arise
again
i
doubt
if
the
law
of
evolution
could
ever
again
produce
him
or
any
other
species
of
animal
this
principle
of
variation
was
no
doubt
much
more
active
back
in
geologic
time
during
the
early
history
of
animal
life
upon
the
globe
than
it
is
in
this
late
age
and
for
the
reason
that
animal
life
was
less
adapted
to
its
environment
than
it
is
now
the
struggle
for
life
was
sharper
perfect
adaptation
of
any
form
of
life
to
the
conditions
surrounding
it
seems
to
check
variability
animal
and
plant
life
seem
to
vary
more
in
this
country
than
in
england
because
the
conditions
of
life
are
harder
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
of
wet
and
dry
are
much
greater
it
has
been
found
that
the
eggs
of
the
english
sparrow
vary
in
form
and
color
more
in
the
united
states
than
in
great
britain
certain
american
shells
are
said
to
be
more
variable
than
the
english
among
our
own
birds
it
has
been
found
that
the
migratory
species
evince
a
greater
amount
of
individual
variation
than
do
species
because
they
are
subject
to
more
varying
conditions
of
food
and
climate
i
think
we
may
say
then
if
there
were
no
struggle
for
life
if
uniformity
of
temperature
and
means
of
subsistence
everywhere
prevailed
there
would
be
little
or
no
variation
and
no
new
species
would
arise
the
causes
of
variation
seem
to
be
the
inequality
and
imperfection
of
things
the
pressure
of
life
is
unequally
distributed
and
this
is
one
of
nature
ways
that
accounts
for
much
that
we
see
about
us
viii
what
do
animals
know
after
the
discussion
carried
on
in
the
foregoing
chapters
touching
the
general
subject
of
animal
life
and
instinct
we
are
prepared
i
think
to
ask
with
more
confidence
what
do
animals
know
the
animals
unite
such
ignorance
with
such
apparent
knowledge
such
stupidity
with
such
cleverness
that
in
our
estimate
of
them
we
are
likely
to
rate
their
wit
either
too
high
or
too
low
with
them
knowledge
does
not
fade
into
ignorance
as
it
does
in
man
the
contrast
is
like
that
between
night
and
day
with
no
twilight
between
so
keen
one
moment
so
blind
the
next
think
of
the
ignorance
of
the
horse
after
all
his
long
association
with
man
of
the
trifling
things
along
the
street
at
which
he
will
take
fright
till
he
rushes
off
in
a
wild
panic
of
fear
endangering
his
own
neck
and
the
neck
of
his
driver
one
would
think
that
if
he
had
a
particle
of
sense
he
would
know
that
an
old
hat
or
a
bit
of
paper
was
harmless
but
fear
is
deeply
implanted
in
his
nature
it
has
saved
the
lives
of
his
ancestors
countless
times
and
it
is
still
one
of
his
ruling
passions
i
have
known
a
cow
to
put
her
head
between
two
trees
in
the
woods
a
kind
of
natural
stanchion
and
not
have
wit
enough
to
get
it
out
again
though
she
could
have
done
so
at
once
by
lifting
her
head
to
a
horizontal
position
but
the
best
instance
i
know
of
the
grotesque
ignorance
of
a
cow
is
given
by
hamerton
in
his
chapters
on
animals
the
cow
would
not
give
down
her
milk
unless
she
had
her
calf
before
her
but
her
calf
had
died
so
the
herdsman
took
the
skin
of
the
calf
stuffed
it
with
hay
and
stood
it
up
before
the
inconsolable
mother
instantly
she
proceeded
to
lick
it
and
to
yield
her
milk
one
day
in
licking
it
she
ripped
open
the
seams
and
out
rolled
the
hay
this
the
mother
at
once
proceeded
to
eat
without
any
look
of
surprise
or
alarm
she
liked
hay
herself
her
acquaintance
with
it
was
of
long
standing
and
what
more
natural
to
her
than
that
her
calf
should
turn
out
to
be
made
of
hay
yet
this
very
cow
that
did
not
know
her
calf
from
a
bale
of
hay
would
have
defended
her
young
against
the
attack
of
a
bear
or
a
wolf
in
the
most
skillful
and
heroic
manner
and
the
horse
that
was
nearly
frightened
out
of
its
skin
by
a
white
stone
or
by
the
flutter
of
a
piece
of
newspaper
by
the
roadside
would
find
its
way
back
home
over
a
long
stretch
of
country
or
find
its
way
to
water
in
the
desert
with
a
certainty
you
or
i
could
not
approach
the
that
the
finds
so
difficult
to
approach
with
his
gun
will
yet
alight
upon
his
steel
trap
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
pole
in
the
fields
the
rabbit
that
can
be
so
easily
caught
in
a
snare
or
in
a
will
yet
conceal
its
nest
and
young
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
where
instinct
or
inherited
knowledge
can
come
into
play
the
animals
are
very
wise
but
new
conditions
new
problems
bring
out
their
ignorance
a
college
girl
told
me
an
incident
of
a
red
squirrel
she
had
observed
at
her
home
in
iowa
that
illustrates
how
shallow
the
wit
of
a
squirrel
is
when
confronted
by
new
conditions
this
squirrel
carried
nuts
all
day
and
stored
them
in
the
end
of
a
drainpipe
that
discharged
the
upon
the
pavement
below
the
nuts
obeyed
the
same
law
that
the
did
and
all
rolled
through
the
pipe
and
fell
upon
the
sidewalk
in
the
squirrel
experience
and
in
that
of
his
forbears
all
holes
upon
the
ground
were
stopped
at
the
far
end
or
they
were
like
pockets
and
if
nuts
were
put
in
them
they
stayed
there
a
hollow
tube
open
at
both
ends
that
would
not
hold
nuts
this
was
too
much
for
the
wit
of
the
squirrel
but
how
wise
he
is
about
the
nuts
themselves
among
the
lower
animals
the
ignorance
of
one
is
the
ignorance
of
all
and
the
knowledge
of
one
is
the
knowledge
of
all
in
a
sense
in
which
the
same
is
not
true
among
men
of
course
some
are
more
stupid
than
others
of
the
same
species
but
probably
on
the
one
hand
there
are
no
idiots
among
them
and
on
the
other
none
is
preëminent
in
wit
animals
take
the
first
step
in
knowledge
they
perceive
things
and
discriminate
between
them
but
they
do
not
take
the
second
step
combine
them
analyze
them
and
form
concepts
and
judgments
so
that
whether
animals
know
much
or
little
i
think
we
are
safe
in
saying
that
what
they
know
in
the
human
way
that
is
from
a
process
of
reasoning
is
very
slight
the
animals
all
have
in
varying
degrees
perceptive
intelligence
they
know
what
they
see
hear
smell
feel
so
far
as
it
concerns
them
to
know
it
they
know
their
kind
their
mates
their
enemies
their
food
heat
from
cold
hard
from
soft
and
a
thousand
other
things
that
it
is
important
that
they
should
know
and
they
know
these
things
just
as
we
know
them
through
their
perceptive
powers
we
may
ascribe
intelligence
to
the
animals
in
the
same
sense
in
which
we
ascribe
it
to
a
child
as
the
perception
of
the
differences
or
of
the
likenesses
and
the
relations
of
things
that
is
perceptive
intelligence
but
not
reasoning
intelligence
when
the
child
begins
to
notice
things
to
know
its
mother
to
fear
strangers
to
be
attracted
by
certain
objects
we
say
it
begins
to
show
intelligence
development
in
this
direction
goes
on
for
a
long
time
before
it
can
form
any
proper
judgment
about
things
or
take
the
step
of
reason
if
we
were
to
subtract
from
the
sum
of
the
intelligence
of
an
animal
that
which
it
owes
to
nature
or
inherited
knowledge
the
amount
left
representing
its
own
power
of
thought
would
be
very
small
darwin
tells
of
a
pike
in
an
aquarium
separated
by
from
fish
which
were
its
proper
food
and
that
the
pike
in
trying
to
capture
the
fish
would
often
dash
with
such
violence
against
the
glass
as
to
be
completely
stunned
this
the
pike
did
for
three
months
before
it
learned
caution
after
the
glass
was
removed
the
pike
would
not
attack
those
particular
fishes
but
would
devour
others
that
were
introduced
it
did
not
yet
understand
the
situation
but
merely
associated
the
punishment
it
had
received
with
a
particular
kind
of
fish
during
the
mating
season
the
males
of
some
of
our
birds
may
often
be
seen
dashing
themselves
against
a
window
and
pecking
and
fluttering
against
the
pane
for
hours
at
a
time
day
after
day
they
take
their
own
images
reflected
in
the
glass
to
be
rival
birds
and
are
bent
upon
demolishing
them
they
never
comprehend
the
mystery
of
the
glass
because
glass
is
not
found
in
nature
and
neither
they
nor
their
ancestors
have
had
any
experience
with
it
contrast
these
incidents
with
those
which
darwin
relates
of
the
american
monkeys
when
the
monkeys
had
cut
themselves
once
with
any
sharp
tool
they
would
not
touch
it
again
or
else
would
handle
it
with
the
greatest
caution
they
evinced
the
simpler
forms
of
reason
of
which
monkeys
are
no
doubt
capable
animals
are
wise
as
nature
is
wise
they
partake
each
in
its
own
measure
of
that
universal
intelligence
or
that
is
operative
in
all
things
in
the
vegetable
as
well
as
in
the
animal
world
does
the
body
or
the
life
that
fills
it
reason
when
it
tries
to
get
rid
of
or
to
neutralize
the
effects
of
a
foreign
substance
like
a
bullet
by
encysting
it
or
when
it
thickens
the
skin
on
the
hand
or
on
any
other
part
of
the
body
even
forming
special
pads
called
callosities
as
a
result
of
the
increased
wear
or
friction
this
may
be
called
physiological
intelligence
but
how
blind
this
intelligence
is
at
times
or
how
wanting
in
judgment
may
be
seen
when
it
tries
to
develop
a
callosity
upon
the
foot
as
a
result
of
the
friction
of
the
shoe
and
overdoes
the
matter
and
produces
the
corn
the
corn
is
a
physiological
blunder
or
see
an
unexpected
manifestation
of
this
intelligence
when
we
cut
off
the
central
and
leading
shoot
of
a
spruce
or
of
a
pine
tree
and
straightway
one
of
the
lateral
and
horizontal
branches
rises
up
takes
the
place
of
the
lost
leader
and
carries
the
tree
upward
or
in
the
roots
of
a
tree
working
their
way
through
the
ground
much
like
molten
metal
parting
and
uniting
taking
the
form
of
whatever
object
they
touch
shaping
themselves
to
the
rock
flowing
into
its
seams
the
better
to
get
a
grip
upon
the
earth
and
thus
maintain
an
upright
position
in
the
animal
world
this
foresight
becomes
psychic
intelligence
developing
in
man
the
highest
form
of
all
reasoned
intelligence
when
an
animal
solves
a
new
problem
or
meets
a
new
condition
as
effectually
as
the
tree
or
the
body
does
in
the
cases
i
have
just
cited
we
are
wont
to
ascribe
to
it
powers
of
reason
reason
we
may
call
it
but
it
is
reason
not
its
own
this
universal
or
cosmic
intelligence
makes
up
by
far
the
greater
part
of
what
animals
know
the
domestic
animals
such
as
the
dog
that
have
long
been
under
the
tutelage
of
man
of
course
show
more
independent
power
of
thought
than
the
uneducated
beasts
of
the
fields
and
woods
the
plant
is
wise
in
all
ways
to
reproduce
and
perpetuate
itself
see
the
many
ingenious
devices
for
scattering
seed
in
the
animal
world
this
intelligence
is
most
keen
and
active
in
the
same
direction
the
wit
of
the
animal
comes
out
most
clearly
in
looking
out
for
its
food
and
safety
we
are
often
ready
to
ascribe
reason
to
it
in
feats
shown
in
these
directions
in
man
alone
does
this
universal
intelligence
or
reach
out
beyond
these
primary
needs
and
become
aware
of
itself
what
the
plant
or
the
animal
does
without
thought
or
rule
man
takes
thought
about
he
considers
his
ways
i
noticed
that
the
scallops
in
the
shallow
water
on
the
beach
had
the
power
to
anchor
themselves
to
stones
or
to
some
other
object
by
putting
out
a
little
tough
but
elastic
cable
from
near
the
hinge
and
that
they
did
so
when
the
water
was
rough
but
i
could
not
look
upon
it
as
an
act
of
conscious
or
individual
intelligence
on
the
part
of
the
bivalve
it
was
as
much
an
act
of
the
general
intelligence
to
which
i
refer
as
was
its
hinge
or
its
form
but
when
the
sailor
anchors
his
ship
that
is
another
matter
he
thinks
about
it
he
reasons
from
cause
to
effect
he
sees
the
storm
coming
he
has
a
fund
of
experience
and
his
act
is
a
special
individual
act
the
muskrat
builds
its
house
instinctively
and
all
muskrats
build
alike
man
builds
his
house
from
reason
and
forethought
savages
build
as
nearly
alike
as
the
animals
but
civilized
man
shows
an
endless
variety
the
higher
the
intelligence
the
greater
the
diversity
the
sitting
bird
that
is
so
solicitous
to
keep
its
eggs
warm
or
to
feed
and
defend
its
young
probably
shows
no
more
independent
and
individual
intelligence
than
the
plant
that
strives
so
hard
to
mature
and
scatter
its
seed
a
plant
will
grow
toward
the
light
a
tree
will
try
to
get
from
under
another
tree
that
overshadows
it
a
willow
will
run
its
roots
toward
the
water
but
these
acts
are
the
results
of
external
stimuli
alone
when
i
go
to
pass
the
winter
in
a
warmer
climate
the
act
is
the
result
of
calculation
and
of
weighing
pros
and
cons
i
can
go
of
i
can
refrain
from
going
not
so
with
the
migrating
birds
nature
plans
and
thinks
for
them
it
is
not
an
individual
act
on
the
part
of
each
it
is
a
race
instinct
they
must
go
the
life
of
the
race
demands
it
or
when
the
old
goose
covers
up
her
nest
or
the
rabbit
covers
her
young
with
a
blanket
of
hair
and
grass
of
her
own
weaving
i
do
not
look
upon
these
things
as
independent
acts
of
intelligence
it
is
the
cunning
of
nature
it
is
a
race
instinct
animals
on
the
whole
know
what
is
necessary
for
them
to
know
what
the
conditions
of
life
have
taught
their
ancestors
through
countless
generations
it
is
very
important
for
instance
that
amphibians
shall
have
some
sense
that
shall
guide
them
to
the
water
and
they
have
such
a
sense
it
is
said
that
young
turtles
and
crocodiles
put
down
anywhere
will
turn
instantly
toward
the
nearest
water
it
is
certain
that
the
beasts
of
the
field
have
such
a
sense
much
more
fully
developed
than
has
man
it
is
of
vital
importance
that
birds
should
know
how
to
fly
how
to
build
their
nests
how
to
find
their
proper
food
and
when
and
where
to
migrate
without
instruction
or
example
otherwise
the
race
might
become
extinct
richard
jefferies
says
that
most
need
a
structure
around
them
like
a
cage
to
keep
the
young
from
falling
out
or
from
leaving
the
nest
prematurely
now
if
such
a
structure
were
needed
either
the
race
of
birds
would
have
failed
or
the
structure
would
have
been
added
since
neither
has
happened
we
are
safe
in
concluding
it
is
not
needed
we
are
not
warranted
in
attributing
to
any
wild
untrained
animal
a
degree
of
intelligence
that
its
forbears
could
not
have
possessed
the
animals
for
the
most
part
act
upon
inherited
knowledge
that
is
knowledge
that
does
not
depend
upon
instruction
or
experience
for
instance
the
red
squirrels
near
me
seem
to
know
that
will
open
if
cut
from
the
tree
and
allowed
to
lie
upon
the
ground
at
least
they
act
upon
this
theory
i
do
not
suppose
this
fact
or
knowledge
lies
in
the
squirrel
mind
as
it
would
in
that
of
a
man
as
a
deduction
from
facts
of
experience
or
of
observation
the
squirrel
cuts
off
the
chestnuts
because
he
is
hungry
for
them
and
because
his
ancestors
for
long
generations
have
cut
them
off
in
the
same
way
that
the
air
or
sun
will
cause
the
burs
to
open
is
a
bit
of
knowledge
that
i
do
not
suppose
he
possesses
in
the
sense
in
which
we
possess
it
he
is
in
a
hurry
for
the
nuts
and
does
not
by
any
means
always
wait
for
the
burs
to
open
he
frequently
chips
them
up
and
eats
the
pale
nuts
the
same
squirrel
will
bite
into
the
limbs
of
a
maple
tree
in
spring
and
suck
the
sap
what
does
he
know
about
maple
trees
and
the
spring
flow
of
sap
nothing
as
a
mental
concept
as
a
bit
of
concrete
knowledge
he
often
finds
the
sap
flowing
from
a
crack
or
other
wound
in
the
limbs
of
a
maple
and
he
sips
it
and
likes
it
then
he
sinks
his
teeth
into
the
limb
as
his
forbears
undoubtedly
did
when
i
was
a
boy
and
saw
as
i
often
did
on
my
way
to
school
where
a
squirrel
had
stopped
on
his
course
through
the
woods
and
dug
down
through
two
or
three
feet
of
snow
bringing
up
a
or
an
acorn
i
used
to
wonder
how
he
knew
the
nut
was
there
i
am
now
convinced
that
he
smelled
it
why
should
he
not
it
stands
the
squirrel
in
hand
to
smell
nuts
they
are
his
life
he
knows
a
false
nut
from
a
good
one
without
biting
into
it
try
the
experiment
upon
your
tame
chipmunk
or
caged
gray
squirrel
and
see
if
this
is
not
so
the
false
or
dead
nut
is
lighter
and
most
persons
think
this
fact
guides
the
squirrel
but
this
it
seems
to
me
implies
an
association
of
ideas
beyond
the
reach
of
instinct
a
young
squirrel
will
reject
a
worthless
nut
as
promptly
as
an
old
one
will
again
the
sense
of
smell
is
the
guide
the
nut
has
an
odor
which
the
other
has
not
all
animals
are
keen
and
wise
in
relation
to
their
food
and
to
their
natural
enemies
a
red
squirrel
will
chip
up
green
apples
and
pears
for
the
seeds
at
the
core
can
he
know
on
general
principles
that
these
fruits
contain
seeds
does
not
some
clue
to
them
reach
his
senses
i
have
known
gray
squirrels
to
go
many
hundred
yards
in
winter
across
fields
to
a
barn
that
contained
grain
in
the
sheaf
they
could
have
had
no
other
guide
to
the
grain
than
the
sense
of
smell
watch
a
chipmunk
or
any
squirrel
near
at
hand
as
a
friend
of
mine
observed
he
seems
to
be
smelling
with
his
whole
body
his
abdomen
fairly
palpitates
with
the
effort
the
coon
knows
when
the
corn
is
in
the
milk
gaining
that
knowledge
no
doubt
through
his
nose
at
times
he
seems
to
know
enough
too
to
cut
off
his
foot
when
caught
in
a
trap
especially
if
the
foot
becomes
frozen
but
if
you
tell
me
he
will
treat
his
wound
by
smearing
it
with
pitch
or
anything
else
or
in
any
way
except
by
licking
it
i
shall
discredit
you
the
practice
of
the
art
of
healing
by
the
application
of
external
or
foreign
substances
is
a
conception
entirely
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
of
the
lower
animals
if
such
a
practice
had
been
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
the
species
it
would
probably
have
been
used
the
knowledge
it
implies
could
not
be
inherited
it
must
needs
come
by
experience
when
a
fowl
eats
gravel
or
sand
is
it
probable
that
the
fowl
knows
what
the
practice
is
for
or
has
any
notion
at
all
about
the
matter
it
has
a
craving
for
the
gravel
that
is
all
nature
is
wise
for
it
the
ostrich
is
described
by
those
who
know
it
intimately
as
the
most
stupid
and
witless
of
birds
and
yet
before
leaving
its
eggs
exposed
to
the
hot
african
sun
the
parent
bird
knows
enough
to
put
a
large
pinch
of
sand
on
the
top
of
each
of
them
in
order
it
is
said
to
shade
and
protect
the
germ
which
always
rises
to
the
highest
point
of
the
egg
this
act
certainly
can
not
be
the
result
of
knowledge
as
we
use
the
term
the
young
ostrich
does
it
as
well
as
the
old
it
is
the
inherited
wisdom
of
the
race
or
instinct
a
sitting
bird
or
fowl
turns
its
eggs
at
regular
intervals
which
has
the
effect
of
keeping
the
yolk
from
sticking
to
the
shell
is
this
act
the
result
of
knowledge
or
of
experience
it
is
again
the
result
of
that
untaught
knowledge
called
instinct
some
kinds
of
eggs
hatch
in
two
weeks
some
in
three
others
in
four
the
mother
bird
has
no
knowledge
of
this
period
it
is
not
important
that
she
should
have
if
the
eggs
are
addled
or
sterile
she
will
often
continue
to
sit
beyond
the
normal
period
if
the
continuance
of
the
species
depended
upon
her
knowing
the
exact
time
required
to
hatch
her
eggs
as
it
depends
upon
her
having
the
incubating
fever
of
course
she
would
know
exactly
and
would
never
sit
beyond
the
required
period
but
what
shall
we
say
of
annie
martin
story
in
her
home
life
on
an
ostrich
farm
of
the
african
crow
that
in
order
to
feast
upon
the
eggs
of
the
ostrich
carries
a
stone
high
in
the
air
above
them
and
breaks
them
by
letting
it
fall
this
looks
like
reason
a
knowledge
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
martin
says
the
crows
break
in
the
same
way
and
have
i
not
heard
of
our
own
crows
and
gulls
carrying
clams
and
crabs
into
the
air
and
dropping
them
upon
the
rocks
if
martin
statements
are
literally
true
if
she
has
not
the
failing
so
common
among
women
observers
of
letting
her
feeling
and
her
fancies
color
her
observations
then
her
story
shows
how
the
pressure
of
hunger
will
develop
the
wit
of
a
crow
but
the
story
goes
one
step
beyond
my
credence
it
virtually
makes
the
crow
a
animal
and
darwin
knew
of
but
two
animals
the
ape
and
the
elephant
that
used
anything
like
a
tool
or
weapon
to
attain
their
ends
how
could
the
crow
gain
the
knowledge
or
the
experience
which
this
trick
implies
what
could
induce
it
to
make
the
first
experiment
of
breaking
an
egg
with
a
falling
stone
but
an
acquaintance
with
physical
laws
such
as
man
alone
possesses
the
first
step
in
this
chain
of
causation
it
is
easy
to
conceive
of
any
animal
taking
namely
the
direct
application
of
its
own
powers
or
weapons
to
the
breaking
of
the
shell
but
the
second
step
the
making
use
of
a
foreign
substance
or
object
in
the
way
described
that
is
what
staggers
one
our
own
crow
has
great
cunning
but
it
is
only
cunning
he
is
suspicious
of
everything
that
looks
like
design
that
suggests
a
trap
even
a
harmless
string
stretched
around
a
as
a
natural
philosopher
he
makes
a
poor
show
and
the
egg
or
the
shell
that
he
can
not
open
with
his
own
beak
he
leaves
behind
yet
even
his
alleged
method
of
dropping
clams
upon
the
rocks
to
break
the
shells
does
not
seem
incredible
he
might
easily
drop
a
clam
by
accident
and
then
finding
the
shell
broken
repeat
the
experiment
he
is
still
only
taking
the
first
step
in
the
sequence
of
causations
a
recent
english
on
the
whole
i
think
a
good
observer
and
truthful
reporter
richard
kearton
tells
of
an
osprey
that
did
this
incredible
thing
to
prevent
its
eggs
from
being
harmed
by
an
enforced
exposure
to
the
sun
the
bird
plunged
into
the
lake
then
rose
and
shook
its
dripping
plumage
over
the
nest
the
writer
apparently
reports
this
story
at
it
is
incredible
to
me
because
it
implies
a
knowledge
that
the
hawk
could
not
possibly
possess
such
an
emergency
could
hardly
arise
once
in
a
lifetime
to
it
or
its
forbears
hence
the
act
could
not
have
been
the
result
of
inherited
habit
or
instinct
and
as
an
original
act
on
the
part
of
the
osprey
it
is
not
credible
the
bird
probably
plunged
into
the
lake
for
a
fish
and
then
by
accident
shook
itself
above
the
eggs
in
any
case
the
amount
of
water
that
would
fall
upon
the
eggs
under
such
circumstances
would
be
too
slight
to
temper
appreciably
the
heat
there
is
little
doubt
that
among
certain
of
our
common
birds
the
male
during
periods
of
excessive
heat
has
been
known
to
shade
the
female
with
his
outstretched
wings
and
the
mother
bird
to
shade
her
young
in
the
same
way
but
this
is
a
different
matter
this
emergency
must
have
occurred
for
ages
and
it
again
called
only
for
the
first
step
from
cause
to
effect
and
called
for
the
use
of
no
intermediate
agent
if
the
robin
were
to
hold
a
leaf
or
a
branch
above
his
mate
at
such
times
that
would
imply
reflection
it
is
said
that
elephants
in
india
will
besmear
themselves
with
mud
as
a
protection
against
insects
and
that
they
will
break
branches
from
the
trees
and
use
them
to
brush
away
the
flies
if
this
is
true
it
shows
i
think
something
beyond
instinct
in
the
elephant
it
shows
reflection
all
birds
are
secretive
about
their
nests
and
display
great
cunning
in
hiding
them
but
whether
they
know
the
value
of
adaptive
material
such
as
moss
lichens
and
dried
grass
in
helping
to
conceal
them
admits
of
doubt
because
they
so
often
use
the
results
of
our
own
arts
as
paper
rags
strings
tinsel
in
such
a
reckless
way
in
a
perfectly
wild
state
they
use
natural
material
because
it
is
the
handiest
and
there
is
really
no
other
the
phoebe
uses
the
moss
on
or
near
the
rocks
where
she
builds
the
sparrows
the
bobolinks
and
the
meadowlarks
use
the
dry
grass
of
the
bank
or
of
the
meadow
bottom
where
the
nest
is
placed
the
english
writer
to
whom
i
have
referred
says
that
the
wren
builds
the
outside
of
its
nest
of
old
hay
straws
when
placing
it
in
the
side
of
a
rick
of
green
moss
when
it
is
situated
in
a
mossy
bank
and
of
dead
leaves
when
in
a
or
a
in
each
case
thus
rendering
the
nest
very
difficult
of
detection
because
it
harmonizes
so
perfectly
with
its
surroundings
and
the
writer
wonders
if
this
harmony
is
the
result
of
accident
or
of
design
he
is
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
unpremeditated
as
i
myself
do
the
bird
uses
the
material
nearest
to
hand
another
case
which
this
same
writer
gives
at
of
a
bird
recognizing
the
value
of
protective
coloration
is
not
credible
a
friend
of
his
told
him
that
he
had
once
visited
a
colony
of
terns
on
an
island
where
the
natural
breeding
accommodation
was
so
limited
that
many
of
them
had
conveyed
patches
of
pebbles
on
to
the
grass
and
laid
their
eggs
thereon
here
is
the
same
difficulty
we
have
encountered
before
one
more
step
of
reasoning
than
the
bird
is
capable
of
as
a
deduction
from
observed
facts
a
bird
of
course
knows
nothing
about
protective
coloring
its
wisdom
in
this
respect
is
the
wisdom
of
nature
and
nature
in
animal
life
never
acts
with
this
kind
of
foresight
a
bird
may
exercise
some
choice
about
the
background
of
its
nest
but
it
will
not
make
both
nest
and
background
nature
learns
by
endless
experiment
through
a
long
and
expensive
process
of
natural
selection
she
seems
to
have
brought
the
color
of
certain
animals
and
the
color
of
their
environment
pretty
close
together
the
better
to
hide
the
animals
from
their
enemies
and
from
their
prey
as
we
are
told
but
the
animals
themselves
do
not
know
this
though
they
may
act
as
if
they
did
young
terns
and
gulls
instinctively
squat
upon
the
beach
where
their
colors
so
harmonize
with
the
sand
and
pebbles
that
the
birds
are
virtually
invisible
young
partridges
do
the
same
in
the
woods
where
the
eye
can
not
tell
the
reddish
tuft
of
down
from
the
dry
leaves
how
many
gulls
and
terns
and
partridges
were
sacrificed
before
nature
learned
this
trick
i
regard
the
lower
animals
as
incapable
of
taking
the
step
from
the
fact
to
the
principle
they
have
perceptions
but
not
conceptions
they
may
recognize
a
certain
fact
but
any
deduction
from
that
fact
to
be
applied
to
a
different
case
or
to
meet
new
conditions
is
beyond
them
wolves
and
foxes
soon
learn
to
be
afraid
of
poisoned
meat
just
what
gives
them
the
hint
it
would
be
hard
to
say
as
the
survivors
could
not
know
the
poison
deadly
effect
from
experience
their
fear
of
it
probably
comes
from
seeing
their
fellows
suffer
and
die
after
eating
it
or
maybe
through
that
mysterious
means
of
communication
between
animals
to
which
i
have
referred
in
a
previous
article
the
poison
probably
changes
the
odor
of
the
meat
and
this
strange
smell
would
naturally
put
them
on
their
guard
we
do
not
expect
rats
to
succeed
in
putting
a
bell
on
the
cat
but
if
they
were
capable
of
conceiving
such
a
thing
that
would
establish
their
claim
to
be
regarded
as
reasonable
beings
i
should
as
soon
expect
a
fox
or
a
wolf
to
make
use
of
a
trap
to
capture
its
prey
as
to
make
use
of
poison
in
any
way
why
does
not
the
fox
take
a
stick
and
spring
the
trap
he
is
so
afraid
of
simply
because
the
act
would
involve
a
mental
process
beyond
him
he
has
not
yet
learned
to
use
even
the
simplest
implement
to
attain
his
end
then
he
would
probably
be
just
as
afraid
of
the
trap
after
it
was
sprung
as
before
he
in
some
way
associates
it
with
his
man
such
stories
too
as
a
chained
fox
or
a
coyote
getting
possession
of
corn
or
other
grain
and
baiting
the
chickens
with
it
feigning
sleep
till
the
chicken
gets
within
reach
and
then
seizing
it
are
of
the
same
class
incredible
because
transcending
the
inherited
knowledge
of
those
animals
i
can
believe
that
a
fox
might
walk
in
a
shallow
creek
to
elude
the
hound
because
he
may
inherit
this
kind
of
cunning
and
in
his
own
experience
he
may
have
come
to
associate
loss
of
scent
with
water
animals
stalk
their
prey
or
lie
in
wait
for
it
instinctively
not
from
a
process
of
calculation
as
man
does
if
a
fox
would
bait
poultry
with
corn
why
should
he
not
in
his
wild
state
bait
mice
and
squirrels
with
nuts
and
seeds
has
a
cat
ever
been
known
to
bait
a
rat
with
a
piece
of
cheese
animals
seem
to
have
a
certain
association
of
ideas
one
thing
suggests
another
to
them
as
with
us
this
fact
is
made
use
of
by
i
can
easily
believe
the
story
charles
john
tells
of
the
fox
he
saw
waylaying
some
hares
and
which
to
screen
himself
the
more
completely
from
his
quarry
scraped
a
small
hollow
in
the
ground
and
threw
up
the
sand
about
it
but
if
john
had
said
that
the
fox
brought
weeds
or
brush
to
make
himself
a
blind
as
the
hunter
often
does
i
should
have
discredited
him
just
as
i
discredit
the
observation
of
a
man
quoted
by
romanes
who
says
that
jackals
ambushing
deer
at
the
latter
deliberately
wait
till
the
deer
have
filled
themselves
with
water
knowing
that
in
that
state
they
are
more
easily
run
down
and
captured
president
roosevelt
in
the
wilderness
hunter
a
book
by
the
way
of
even
deeper
interest
to
the
naturalist
than
to
the
sportsman
says
that
the
moose
has
to
the
hunter
the
very
provoking
habit
of
making
a
half
or
circle
before
lying
down
and
then
crouching
with
its
head
so
turned
that
it
can
surely
perceive
any
pursuer
who
may
follow
its
trail
this
is
the
cunning
of
the
moose
developed
through
long
generations
of
its
hunted
and
ancestors
a
cunning
that
does
not
differ
from
that
of
a
man
under
the
same
circumstances
though
of
course
it
is
not
the
result
of
the
same
process
of
reasoning
i
have
known
a
chipping
sparrow
to
build
her
nest
on
a
just
beneath
a
bunch
of
small
green
grapes
soon
the
bunch
grew
and
lengthened
and
filled
the
nest
crowding
out
the
bird
if
the
bird
could
have
foreseen
the
danger
she
would
have
shown
something
like
human
reason
birds
that
nest
along
streams
such
as
the
and
the
i
suppose
are
rarely
ever
brought
to
grief
by
high
water
they
have
learned
through
many
generations
to
keep
at
a
safe
distance
i
have
never
known
a
woodpecker
to
drill
its
in
a
branch
or
limb
that
was
ready
to
fall
not
that
woodpeckers
look
the
branch
or
tree
over
with
a
view
to
its
stability
but
that
they
will
cut
into
a
tree
only
of
a
certain
hardness
it
is
a
family
instinct
birds
sometimes
make
the
mistake
of
building
their
nests
on
slender
branches
that
a
summer
tempest
will
turn
over
thus
causing
the
eggs
or
the
young
to
spill
upon
the
ground
even
instinct
can
not
always
get
ahead
of
the
weather
it
is
almost
impossible
for
us
not
to
interpret
the
lives
of
the
lower
animals
in
the
terms
of
our
own
experience
and
our
own
psychology
i
entirely
agree
with
lloyd
morgan
that
we
err
when
we
do
so
when
we
attribute
to
them
what
we
call
sentiments
or
any
of
the
emotions
that
spring
from
our
moral
and
æsthetic
natures
the
sentiments
of
justice
truth
beauty
altruism
goodness
duty
and
the
like
because
these
sentiments
are
the
products
of
concepts
and
ideas
to
which
the
brute
natures
are
strangers
but
all
the
emotions
of
our
animal
nature
fear
anger
curiosity
local
attachment
jealousy
and
rivalry
are
undoubtedly
the
same
in
the
lower
orders
though
almost
anything
may
be
affirmed
of
dogs
for
they
are
nearly
half
human
yet
i
doubt
if
even
dogs
experience
the
feeling
of
shame
or
guilt
or
revenge
that
we
so
often
ascribe
to
them
these
feelings
are
all
complex
and
have
a
deep
root
when
i
was
a
youth
my
father
had
a
big
that
appeared
one
morning
with
a
small
in
his
hip
day
after
day
the
old
dog
treated
his
wound
with
his
tongue
after
the
manner
of
dogs
until
it
healed
and
the
incident
was
nearly
forgotten
one
day
a
man
was
going
by
on
horseback
when
the
old
dog
rushed
out
sprang
at
the
man
and
came
near
pulling
him
from
the
horse
it
turned
out
that
this
was
the
person
who
had
shot
the
dog
and
the
dog
recognized
him
this
looks
like
revenge
and
it
would
have
been
such
in
you
or
me
but
in
the
dog
it
was
probably
simple
anger
at
the
sight
of
the
man
who
had
hurt
him
the
incident
shows
memory
and
the
association
of
impressions
but
the
complex
feeling
of
vengeance
as
we
know
it
is
another
matter
if
animals
do
not
share
our
higher
intellectual
nature
we
have
no
warrant
for
attributing
to
them
anything
like
our
higher
and
more
complex
emotional
nature
musical
strains
seem
to
give
them
pain
rather
than
pleasure
and
it
is
quite
evident
that
perfumes
have
no
attraction
for
them
the
stories
which
seem
to
be
well
authenticated
of
dogs
that
have
slipped
their
collars
in
the
night
and
indulged
their
passion
for
live
mutton
and
then
returned
and
thrust
their
necks
into
their
collars
before
their
absence
was
discovered
do
not
to
my
mind
prove
that
the
dogs
were
trying
to
deceive
their
masters
and
conceal
their
guilt
but
rather
show
how
obedient
to
the
chain
and
collar
the
dogs
had
become
they
had
long
been
subject
to
such
control
and
discipline
and
they
returned
to
them
again
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
i
do
not
believe
even
the
dog
to
be
capable
of
a
sense
of
guilt
such
a
sense
implies
a
sense
of
duty
and
this
is
a
complex
ethical
sense
that
the
animals
do
not
experience
what
the
dog
fears
and
what
makes
him
put
on
his
look
of
guilt
and
shame
is
his
master
anger
a
harsh
word
or
a
severe
look
will
make
him
assume
the
air
of
a
culprit
whether
he
is
one
or
not
and
on
the
other
hand
a
kind
word
and
a
reassuring
smile
will
transform
him
into
a
happy
beast
no
matter
if
the
blood
of
his
victim
is
fresh
upon
him
a
dog
is
to
be
broken
of
a
bad
habit
if
at
all
not
by
an
appeal
to
his
conscience
or
to
his
sense
of
duty
for
he
has
neither
but
by
an
appeal
to
his
susceptibility
to
pain
both
pliny
and
plutarch
tell
the
story
of
an
elephant
which
having
been
beaten
by
its
trainer
for
its
poor
dancing
was
afterward
found
all
by
itself
practicing
its
steps
by
the
light
of
the
moon
this
is
just
as
credible
as
many
of
the
animal
stories
one
hears
nowadays
many
of
the
actions
of
the
lower
animals
are
as
automatic
as
those
of
the
tin
rooster
that
serves
as
a
see
how
intelligently
the
rooster
acts
always
pointing
the
direction
of
the
wind
without
a
moment
hesitation
or
behold
the
vessel
anchored
in
the
harbor
how
intelligently
it
adjusts
itself
to
the
winds
and
the
tides
i
have
seen
a
log
caught
in
an
eddy
in
a
flooded
stream
apparently
make
such
struggles
to
escape
that
the
thing
became
almost
uncanny
in
its
semblance
to
life
man
himself
often
obeys
just
such
unseen
currents
of
race
or
history
when
he
thinks
he
is
acting
upon
his
own
initiative
when
i
was
in
alaska
i
saw
precipices
down
which
hundreds
of
horses
had
dashed
themselves
in
their
mad
and
desperate
efforts
to
escape
from
the
toil
and
suffering
they
underwent
on
the
white
pass
trail
shall
we
say
these
horses
deliberately
committed
suicide
suicide
it
certainly
was
in
effect
but
of
course
not
in
intention
what
does
or
can
a
horse
know
about
death
or
about
these
animals
were
maddened
by
their
hardships
and
blindly
plunged
down
the
rocks
the
tendency
to
humanize
the
animals
is
more
and
more
marked
in
all
recent
nature
books
that
aim
at
popularity
a
recent
british
book
on
animal
life
has
a
chapter
entitled
animal
materia
medica
the
writer
to
make
out
his
case
is
forced
to
treat
as
medicine
the
salt
which
the
herbivorous
animals
eat
and
the
sand
and
gravel
which
grain
and
birds
take
into
their
gizzards
to
act
as
millstones
to
grind
their
grist
he
might
as
well
treat
their
food
as
medicine
and
be
done
with
it
so
far
as
i
know
animals
have
no
remedies
whatever
for
their
ailments
even
savages
have
for
the
most
part
only
fake
medicines
a
frenchman
has
published
a
book
which
has
been
translated
into
english
on
the
industries
of
animals
some
of
these
frenchmen
could
give
points
even
to
our
modern
school
of
nature
study
it
may
be
remembered
that
michelet
said
the
bird
floated
and
that
it
could
puff
itself
up
so
that
it
was
lighter
than
the
air
not
a
little
contemporary
natural
science
can
beat
the
bird
in
this
respect
the
serious
student
of
nature
can
have
no
interest
in
belittling
or
in
exaggerating
the
intelligence
of
animals
what
he
wants
is
the
truth
about
them
and
this
he
will
not
get
from
our
natural
history
romancers
nor
from
the
casual
untrained
observers
who
are
sure
to
interpret
the
lives
of
the
in
terms
of
their
own
motives
and
experiences
nor
from
indians
trappers
or
backwoodsmen
who
give
such
free
rein
to
their
fancies
and
superstitions
such
a
book
as
romanes
animal
intelligence
is
not
always
a
safe
guide
it
is
like
a
lawyer
plea
to
the
jury
for
his
client
romanes
was
so
intent
upon
making
out
his
case
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
tales
of
irresponsible
observers
many
of
his
stories
of
the
intelligence
of
birds
and
beasts
are
antecedently
improbable
he
evidently
credits
the
story
of
the
bishop
of
carlisle
who
thinks
he
saw
a
jackdaw
being
tried
by
a
jury
of
rooks
for
some
misdemeanor
jack
made
a
speech
and
the
jury
cawed
back
at
him
and
after
a
time
appeared
to
acquit
jack
what
a
child
fancy
to
be
put
in
a
serious
work
on
animal
intelligence
the
dead
birds
we
now
and
then
find
hanging
from
the
nest
or
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
with
a
string
wound
around
their
necks
are
no
doubt
criminals
upon
whom
their
fellows
have
inflicted
capital
punishment
most
of
the
observations
upon
which
romanes
bases
his
conclusions
are
like
the
incident
which
he
quoted
from
jesse
who
tells
of
some
swallows
that
in
the
spirit
of
revenge
tore
down
a
nest
from
which
they
had
been
ejected
by
the
sparrows
in
order
to
destroy
the
young
of
their
enemies
a
feat
impossible
for
swallows
to
do
jesse
does
not
say
he
saw
the
swallows
do
it
but
he
saw
the
young
sparrows
dead
upon
the
ground
amid
the
ruins
of
the
nest
and
of
course
the
nest
could
get
down
in
no
other
way
not
to
romanes
or
jesse
or
michelet
must
we
go
for
the
truth
about
animals
but
to
the
patient
honest
darwin
to
such
calm
keen
and
philosophical
investigators
as
lloyd
morgan
and
to
the
books
of
such
sportsmen
as
charles
john
or
to
our
own
candid
trained
and
theodore
roosevelt
men
capable
of
disinterested
observation
with
no
theories
about
animals
to
uphold
ix
do
animals
think
and
reflect
when
we
see
the
animals
going
about
living
their
lives
in
many
ways
as
we
live
ours
seeking
their
food
avoiding
their
enemies
building
their
nests
digging
their
holes
laying
up
stores
migrating
courting
playing
fighting
showing
cunning
courage
fear
joy
anger
rivalry
grief
profiting
by
experience
following
their
leaders
when
we
see
all
this
i
say
what
more
natural
than
that
we
should
ascribe
to
them
powers
akin
to
our
own
and
look
upon
them
as
thinking
reasoning
and
reflecting
a
hasty
survey
of
animal
life
is
sure
to
lead
to
this
conclusion
an
animal
is
not
a
clod
nor
a
block
nor
a
machine
it
is
alive
and
it
has
some
sort
of
psychic
life
yet
the
more
i
study
the
subject
the
more
i
am
persuaded
that
with
the
probable
exception
of
the
dog
on
occasions
and
of
the
apes
animals
do
not
think
or
reflect
in
any
proper
sense
of
those
words
as
i
have
before
said
animal
life
shows
in
an
active
and
free
state
that
kind
of
intelligence
that
pervades
and
governs
the
whole
organic
world
intelligence
that
takes
no
thought
of
itself
here
in
front
of
my
window
is
a
black
raspberry
bush
a
few
weeks
ago
its
branches
curved
upward
with
their
ends
swinging
fully
two
feet
above
the
ground
now
those
ends
are
thrust
down
through
the
weeds
and
are
fast
rooted
to
the
soil
did
the
raspberry
bush
think
or
choose
what
it
should
do
did
it
reflect
and
say
now
is
the
time
for
me
to
bend
down
and
thrust
my
tip
into
the
ground
to
all
intents
and
purposes
yes
yet
there
was
no
voluntary
mental
process
as
in
similar
acts
of
our
own
we
say
its
nature
prompts
it
to
act
thus
and
thus
and
that
is
all
the
explanation
we
can
give
or
take
the
case
of
the
pine
or
the
spruce
tree
that
loses
its
central
and
leading
shoot
when
this
happens
does
the
tree
start
a
new
bud
and
then
develop
a
new
shoot
to
take
the
place
of
the
lost
leader
no
a
branch
from
the
first
ring
of
branches
below
probably
the
most
vigorous
of
the
whorl
is
promoted
to
the
leadership
slowly
it
rises
up
and
in
two
or
three
years
it
reaches
the
upright
position
and
is
leading
the
tree
upward
this
i
suspect
is
just
as
much
an
act
of
conscious
intelligence
and
of
reason
as
is
much
to
which
we
are
so
inclined
to
apply
those
words
in
animal
life
i
suppose
it
is
all
foreordained
in
the
economy
of
the
tree
if
we
could
penetrate
that
economy
it
is
in
this
sense
that
nature
thinks
in
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
and
the
mineral
worlds
her
thinking
is
more
flexible
and
adaptive
in
the
vegetable
than
in
the
mineral
and
more
so
in
the
animal
than
in
the
vegetable
and
the
most
so
of
all
in
the
mind
of
man
the
way
the
wild
apple
trees
and
the
red
thorn
trees
in
the
pasture
as
described
by
thoreau
triumph
over
the
cattle
that
year
after
year
browse
them
down
suggests
something
almost
like
human
tactics
the
cropped
and
bruised
tree
not
being
allowed
to
shoot
upward
spreads
more
and
more
laterally
thus
pushing
its
enemies
farther
and
farther
away
till
after
many
years
a
shoot
starts
up
from
the
top
of
the
thorny
knotted
cone
and
in
one
season
protected
by
this
attains
a
height
beyond
the
reach
of
the
cattle
and
the
victory
is
won
now
the
whole
push
of
the
large
root
system
goes
into
the
central
shoot
and
the
tree
is
rapidly
developed
this
almost
looks
like
a
scheme
on
the
part
of
the
tree
to
defeat
its
enemies
but
see
how
inevitable
the
whole
process
is
check
the
direct
flow
of
a
current
and
it
will
flow
out
at
the
sides
check
the
side
issues
and
they
will
push
out
on
their
sides
and
so
on
so
it
is
with
the
tree
or
seedling
the
more
it
is
cropped
the
more
it
branches
and
rebranches
pushing
out
laterally
as
its
vertical
growth
is
checked
till
it
has
surrounded
the
central
stalk
on
all
sides
with
a
dense
thorny
hedge
then
as
this
stalk
is
no
longer
cropped
it
leads
the
tree
upward
the
lateral
branches
are
starved
and
in
a
few
years
the
tree
stands
with
little
or
no
evidence
of
the
ordeal
it
has
passed
through
in
like
manner
the
nature
of
the
animals
prompts
them
to
the
deeds
they
do
and
we
think
of
them
as
the
result
of
a
mental
process
because
similar
acts
in
ourselves
are
the
result
of
such
a
process
see
how
the
mice
begin
to
press
into
our
buildings
as
the
fall
comes
on
do
they
know
winter
is
coming
in
the
same
way
the
vegetable
world
knows
it
is
coming
when
it
prepares
for
winter
or
the
insect
world
when
it
makes
ready
but
not
as
you
and
i
know
it
the
woodchuck
holes
up
in
late
september
the
crows
flock
and
select
their
rookery
about
the
same
time
and
the
small
wood
newts
or
salamanders
soon
begin
to
migrate
to
the
marshes
they
all
know
winter
is
coming
just
as
much
as
the
tree
knows
when
in
august
it
forms
its
new
buds
for
the
next
year
or
as
the
flower
knows
that
its
color
and
perfume
will
attract
the
insects
and
no
more
the
general
intelligence
of
nature
settles
all
these
and
similar
things
when
a
bird
selects
a
site
for
its
nest
it
seems
on
first
view
as
if
it
must
actually
think
reflect
compare
as
you
and
i
do
when
we
decide
where
to
place
our
house
i
saw
a
little
chipping
sparrow
trying
to
decide
between
two
raspberry
bushes
she
kept
going
from
one
to
the
other
peering
inspecting
and
apparently
weighing
the
advantages
of
each
i
saw
a
robin
in
the
woodbine
on
the
side
of
the
house
trying
to
decide
which
particular
place
was
the
best
site
for
her
nest
she
hopped
to
this
tangle
of
shoots
and
sat
down
then
to
that
she
turned
around
she
readjusted
herself
she
looked
about
she
worked
her
feet
beneath
her
she
was
slow
in
making
up
her
mind
did
she
make
up
her
mind
did
she
think
compare
weigh
i
do
not
believe
it
when
she
found
the
right
conditions
she
no
doubt
felt
pleasure
and
satisfaction
and
that
settled
the
question
an
inward
instinctive
want
was
met
and
satisfied
by
an
outward
material
condition
in
the
same
way
the
hermit
crab
goes
from
shell
to
shell
upon
the
beach
seeking
one
to
its
liking
sometimes
two
crabs
fall
to
fighting
over
a
shell
that
each
wants
can
we
believe
that
the
hermit
crab
thinks
and
reasons
it
selects
the
suitable
shell
instinctively
and
not
by
an
individual
act
of
judgment
instinct
is
not
always
inerrant
though
it
makes
fewer
mistakes
than
reason
does
the
red
squirrel
usually
knows
how
to
come
at
the
meat
in
the
butternut
with
the
least
gnawing
but
now
and
then
he
makes
a
mistake
and
strikes
the
edge
of
the
kernel
instead
of
the
flat
side
the
cliff
swallow
will
stick
her
mud
nest
under
the
eaves
of
a
barn
where
the
boards
are
planed
so
smooth
that
the
nest
sooner
or
later
is
bound
to
fall
she
seems
to
have
no
judgment
in
the
matter
her
ancestors
built
upon
the
face
of
high
cliffs
where
the
mud
adhered
more
firmly
a
wood
thrush
began
a
nest
in
one
of
my
maples
as
usual
making
the
foundation
of
dry
leaves
bits
of
paper
and
dry
grass
after
the
third
day
the
site
on
the
branch
was
bare
the
wind
having
swept
away
every
vestige
of
the
nest
as
i
passed
beneath
the
tree
i
saw
the
thrush
standing
where
the
nest
had
been
apparently
in
deep
thought
a
few
days
afterward
i
looked
again
and
the
nest
was
completed
the
bird
had
got
ahead
of
the
wind
at
last
the
had
triumphed
over
the
weather
take
the
case
of
the
little
yellow
warbler
when
the
cowbird
drops
her
egg
into
its
nest
does
anything
like
a
process
of
thought
or
reflection
pass
in
the
bird
mind
then
the
warbler
is
much
disturbed
when
she
discovers
the
strange
egg
and
her
mate
appears
to
share
her
agitation
then
after
a
time
and
after
the
two
have
apparently
considered
the
matter
together
the
mother
bird
proceeds
to
bury
the
egg
by
building
another
nest
on
top
of
the
old
one
if
another
cowbird
egg
is
dropped
in
this
one
she
will
proceed
to
get
rid
of
this
in
the
same
way
this
all
looks
very
like
reflection
but
let
us
consider
the
matter
a
moment
this
thing
between
the
cowbird
and
the
warbler
has
been
going
on
for
innumerable
generations
the
yellow
warbler
seems
to
be
the
favorite
host
of
this
parasite
and
something
like
a
special
instinct
may
have
grown
up
in
the
warbler
with
reference
to
this
strange
egg
the
bird
reacts
as
the
psychologists
say
at
sight
of
it
then
she
proceeds
to
dispose
of
it
in
the
way
above
described
yellow
warblers
act
in
the
same
which
is
the
way
of
instinct
now
if
this
procedure
was
the
result
of
an
individual
thought
or
calculation
on
the
part
of
the
birds
they
would
not
all
do
the
same
thing
different
lines
of
conduct
would
be
hit
upon
how
much
simpler
and
easier
it
would
be
to
throw
the
egg
out
how
much
more
like
an
act
of
rational
intelligence
so
far
as
i
know
no
bird
does
eject
this
parasitical
egg
and
no
other
bird
besides
the
yellow
warbler
gets
rid
of
it
in
the
way
i
have
described
i
have
found
a
deserted
phoebe
nest
with
one
egg
of
the
phoebe
and
one
of
the
cowbird
in
it
some
of
our
wild
birds
have
changed
their
habits
of
nesting
coming
from
the
woods
and
the
rocks
to
the
protection
of
our
buildings
the
and
the
cliff
swallow
are
marked
examples
we
ascribe
the
change
to
the
birds
intelligence
but
to
my
mind
it
shows
only
their
natural
adaptiveness
take
the
cliff
swallow
for
instance
it
has
largely
left
the
cliffs
for
the
eaves
of
our
buildings
how
naturally
and
instinctively
this
change
has
come
about
in
an
open
farming
country
insect
life
is
much
more
varied
and
abundant
than
in
a
wild
unsettled
country
this
greater
food
supply
naturally
attracts
the
swallows
then
the
protecting
eaves
of
the
buildings
would
stimulate
their
the
abundance
of
mud
along
the
highways
and
about
the
farm
would
also
no
doubt
have
its
effect
and
the
birds
would
adopt
the
new
sites
as
a
matter
of
course
or
take
the
phoebe
which
originally
built
its
nest
under
ledges
and
does
so
still
to
some
extent
it
too
would
find
a
more
abundant
food
supply
in
the
vicinity
of
and
bridges
the
protected
afforded
by
sheds
and
porches
would
likewise
stimulate
its
and
attract
the
bird
as
we
see
it
attracted
each
spring
nearly
everything
an
animal
does
is
the
result
of
an
inborn
instinct
acted
upon
by
an
outward
stimulus
the
margin
wherein
intelligent
choice
plays
a
part
is
very
small
but
it
does
at
times
play
a
part
perceptive
intelligence
but
not
rational
intelligence
the
insects
do
many
things
that
look
like
intelligence
yet
how
these
things
differ
from
human
intelligence
may
be
seen
in
the
case
of
one
of
our
solitary
wasps
the
which
sometimes
builds
its
cell
with
great
labor
then
seals
it
up
without
laying
its
egg
and
storing
it
with
the
accustomed
spiders
intelligence
never
makes
that
kind
of
a
mistake
but
instinct
does
instinct
acts
more
in
the
invariable
way
of
a
machine
certain
of
the
solitary
wasps
bring
their
game
spider
or
bug
or
grasshopper
and
place
it
just
at
the
entrance
of
their
hole
and
then
go
into
their
den
apparently
to
see
that
all
is
right
before
they
carry
it
in
fabre
the
french
naturalist
experimented
with
one
of
these
wasps
as
follows
while
the
wasp
was
in
its
den
he
moved
its
grasshopper
a
few
inches
away
the
wasp
came
out
brought
it
to
the
opening
as
before
and
went
within
a
second
time
again
the
game
was
removed
again
the
wasp
came
out
and
brought
it
back
and
entered
her
nest
as
before
this
little
comedy
was
repeated
over
and
over
each
time
the
wasp
felt
compelled
to
enter
her
hole
before
dragging
in
the
grasshopper
she
was
like
a
machine
that
would
work
that
way
and
no
other
step
must
follow
step
in
just
such
order
any
interruption
of
the
regular
method
and
she
must
begin
over
again
this
is
instinct
and
the
incident
shows
how
widely
it
differs
from
conscious
intelligence
if
you
have
a
tame
chipmunk
turn
him
loose
in
an
empty
room
and
give
him
some
nuts
finding
no
place
to
hide
them
he
will
doubtless
carry
them
into
a
corner
and
pretend
to
cover
them
up
you
will
see
his
paws
move
quickly
about
them
for
an
instant
as
if
in
the
act
of
pulling
leaves
or
mould
over
them
his
machine
too
must
work
in
that
way
after
the
nuts
have
been
laid
down
the
next
thing
in
order
is
to
cover
them
and
he
makes
the
motions
all
in
due
form
intelligence
would
have
omitted
this
useless
act
a
in
its
cage
will
go
through
all
the
motions
of
taking
a
bath
in
front
of
the
cup
that
holds
its
when
it
can
only
dip
its
bill
into
the
liquid
the
sight
or
touch
of
the
water
excites
it
and
sets
it
going
and
with
now
and
then
a
drop
thrown
from
its
beak
it
will
keep
up
the
flirting
and
fluttering
motion
of
its
tail
and
wings
precisely
as
if
taking
a
real
instead
of
an
imaginary
bath
attempt
to
thwart
the
in
a
bird
and
see
how
persistent
it
is
and
how
blind
one
spring
a
pair
of
english
sparrows
tried
to
build
a
nest
on
the
plate
that
upholds
the
roof
of
my
porch
they
were
apparently
attracted
by
an
opening
about
an
inch
wide
in
the
top
of
the
plate
that
ran
the
whole
length
of
it
the
pair
were
busy
nearly
the
whole
month
of
april
in
carrying
to
various
points
on
that
plate
that
big
crack
or
opening
which
was
not
large
enough
to
admit
their
bodies
seemed
to
have
a
powerful
fascination
for
them
they
carried
straws
and
weed
stalks
and
filled
up
one
portion
of
it
and
then
another
and
another
till
the
crack
was
packed
with
rubbish
from
one
end
of
the
porch
to
the
other
and
the
indignant
broom
of
the
housekeeper
grew
tired
of
sweeping
up
the
litter
the
birds
could
not
effect
an
entrance
into
the
interior
of
the
plate
but
they
could
thrust
in
their
and
so
they
persisted
week
after
week
stimulated
by
the
presence
of
a
cavity
beyond
their
reach
the
case
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
blind
working
of
instinct
animals
have
keen
perceptions
keener
in
many
respects
than
our
own
but
they
form
no
conceptions
have
no
powers
of
comparing
one
thing
with
another
they
live
entirely
in
and
through
their
senses
it
is
as
if
the
psychic
world
were
divided
into
two
planes
one
above
the
other
the
plane
of
sense
and
the
plane
of
spirit
in
the
plane
of
sense
live
the
lower
animals
only
now
and
then
just
breaking
for
a
moment
into
the
higher
plane
in
the
world
of
sense
man
is
immersed
also
this
is
his
start
and
foundation
but
he
rises
into
the
plane
of
spirit
and
here
lives
his
proper
life
he
is
emancipated
from
sense
in
a
way
that
beasts
are
not
thus
i
think
the
line
between
animal
and
human
psychology
may
be
pretty
clearly
drawn
it
is
not
a
line
instinct
is
undoubtedly
often
modified
by
intelligence
and
intelligence
is
as
often
guided
or
prompted
by
instinct
but
one
need
not
hesitate
long
as
to
which
side
of
the
line
any
given
act
of
man
or
beast
belongs
when
the
fox
resorts
to
various
tricks
to
outwit
and
delay
the
hound
if
he
ever
consciously
does
so
he
exercises
a
kind
of
intelligence
the
lower
form
which
we
call
cunning
and
he
is
prompted
to
this
by
an
instinct
of
when
the
birds
set
up
a
hue
and
cry
about
a
hawk
or
an
owl
or
boldly
attack
him
they
show
intelligence
in
its
simpler
form
the
intelligence
that
recognizes
its
enemies
prompted
again
by
the
instinct
of
when
a
hawk
does
not
know
a
man
on
horseback
from
a
horse
it
shows
a
want
of
intelligence
when
a
crow
is
kept
away
from
a
by
a
string
stretched
around
it
the
fact
shows
how
masterful
is
its
fear
and
how
shallow
its
wit
when
a
cat
or
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
a
cow
learns
to
open
a
gate
or
a
door
it
shows
a
degree
of
intelligence
power
to
imitate
to
profit
by
experience
a
machine
could
not
learn
to
do
this
if
the
animal
were
to
close
the
door
or
gate
behind
it
that
would
be
another
step
in
intelligence
but
its
direct
wants
have
no
relation
to
the
closing
of
the
door
only
to
the
opening
of
it
to
close
the
door
involves
an
that
an
animal
is
not
capable
of
a
horse
will
hesitate
to
go
upon
thin
ice
or
upon
a
frail
bridge
even
though
it
has
never
had
any
experience
with
thin
ice
or
frail
bridges
this
no
doubt
is
an
inherited
instinct
which
has
arisen
in
its
ancestors
from
their
fund
of
general
experience
with
the
world
how
much
with
them
has
depended
upon
a
secure
footing
a
pair
of
house
wrens
had
a
nest
in
my
when
the
young
were
partly
grown
and
heard
any
one
come
to
the
curb
they
would
set
up
a
clamorous
calling
for
food
when
i
scratched
against
the
sides
of
the
curb
beneath
them
like
some
animal
trying
to
climb
up
their
voices
instantly
hushed
the
instinct
of
fear
promptly
overcame
the
instinct
of
hunger
instinct
is
intelligent
but
it
is
not
the
same
as
acquired
individual
intelligence
it
is
untaught
when
the
nuthatch
carries
a
fragment
of
a
to
a
tree
and
wedges
it
into
a
crevice
in
the
bark
the
bird
is
not
showing
an
individual
act
of
intelligence
all
nuthatches
do
this
it
is
a
race
instinct
the
act
shows
intelligence
that
is
it
adapts
means
to
an
end
but
it
is
not
like
human
or
individual
intelligence
which
adapts
new
means
to
old
ends
or
old
means
to
new
ends
and
which
springs
up
on
the
occasion
jays
and
chickadees
hold
the
nut
or
seed
they
would
peck
under
the
foot
but
the
nuthatch
makes
a
vise
to
hold
it
of
the
bark
of
the
tree
and
one
act
is
just
as
intelligent
as
the
other
both
are
the
promptings
of
instinct
but
when
man
makes
a
vise
or
a
wedge
or
a
bootjack
he
uses
his
individual
intelligence
when
the
jay
carries
away
the
corn
you
put
out
in
winter
and
hides
it
in
old
worms
nests
and
and
crevices
in
trees
he
is
obeying
the
instinct
of
all
his
tribe
to
pilfer
and
hide
things
an
instinct
that
plays
its
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
as
by
its
means
many
acorns
and
chestnuts
get
planted
and
large
seeds
widely
disseminated
by
this
greed
of
the
jay
the
wingless
nuts
take
flight
oaks
are
planted
amid
the
pines
and
chestnuts
amid
the
hemlocks
speaking
of
nuts
reminds
me
of
an
incident
i
read
of
the
deer
or
mouse
an
incident
that
throws
light
on
the
limitation
of
animal
intelligence
the
writer
gave
the
mouse
which
it
attempted
to
carry
through
a
crack
between
the
laths
in
the
kitchen
wall
the
nuts
were
too
large
to
go
through
the
crack
the
mouse
would
try
to
push
them
through
failing
in
that
he
would
go
through
and
then
try
to
pull
them
after
him
all
night
he
or
his
companion
seems
to
have
kept
up
this
futile
attempt
fumbling
and
dropping
the
nut
every
few
minutes
it
never
occurred
to
the
mouse
to
gnaw
the
hole
larger
as
it
would
instantly
have
done
had
the
hole
been
too
small
to
admit
its
own
body
it
could
not
project
its
mind
thus
far
it
could
not
get
out
of
itself
sufficiently
to
regard
the
nut
in
its
relation
to
the
hole
and
it
is
doubtful
if
any
animal
is
capable
of
that
degree
of
reflection
and
comparison
nothing
in
its
own
life
or
in
the
life
of
its
ancestors
had
prepared
it
to
meet
that
kind
of
a
difficulty
with
nuts
and
yet
the
writer
who
made
the
above
observation
says
that
when
confined
in
a
box
the
sides
of
which
are
of
unequal
thickness
the
deer
mouse
on
attempting
to
gnaw
out
almost
invariably
attacks
the
thinnest
side
how
does
he
know
which
is
the
thinnest
side
probably
by
a
delicate
and
trained
sense
of
feeling
or
hearing
in
gnawing
through
obstructions
from
within
or
from
without
he
and
his
kind
have
had
ample
experience
now
when
we
come
to
insects
we
find
that
the
above
inferences
do
not
hold
it
has
been
observed
that
when
a
solitary
wasp
finds
its
hole
in
the
ground
too
small
to
admit
the
spider
or
other
insect
which
it
has
brought
it
falls
to
and
enlarges
it
in
this
and
in
other
respects
certain
insects
seem
to
take
the
step
of
reason
that
quadrupeds
are
incapable
of
lloyd
morgan
relates
at
some
length
the
experiments
he
tried
with
his
fox
terrier
tony
seeking
to
teach
him
how
to
bring
a
stick
through
a
fence
with
vertical
palings
the
spaces
would
allow
the
dog
to
pass
through
but
the
palings
caught
the
ends
of
the
stick
which
the
dog
carried
in
his
mouth
when
his
master
encouraged
him
he
pushed
and
struggled
vigorously
not
succeeding
he
went
back
lay
down
and
began
gnawing
the
stick
then
he
tried
again
and
stuck
as
before
but
by
a
chance
movement
of
his
head
to
one
side
finally
got
the
stick
through
his
master
patted
him
approvingly
and
sent
him
for
the
stick
again
again
he
seized
it
by
the
middle
and
of
course
brought
up
against
the
palings
after
some
struggles
he
dropped
it
and
came
through
without
it
then
encouraged
by
his
master
he
put
his
head
through
seized
the
stick
and
tried
to
pull
it
through
dancing
up
and
down
in
his
endeavors
time
after
time
and
day
after
day
the
experiment
was
repeated
with
practically
the
same
results
the
dog
never
mastered
the
problem
he
could
not
see
the
relation
of
that
stick
to
the
opening
in
the
fence
at
one
time
he
worked
and
tugged
three
minutes
trying
to
pull
the
stick
through
of
course
if
he
had
had
any
mental
conception
of
the
problem
or
had
thought
about
it
at
all
a
single
trial
would
have
convinced
him
as
well
as
would
a
dozen
trials
morgan
tried
the
experiment
with
other
dogs
with
like
result
when
they
did
get
the
stick
through
it
was
always
by
chance
it
has
never
been
necessary
that
the
dog
or
his
ancestors
should
know
how
to
fetch
long
sticks
through
a
narrow
opening
in
a
fence
hence
he
does
not
know
the
trick
of
it
but
we
have
a
little
bird
that
knows
the
trick
the
house
wren
will
carry
a
twig
three
inches
long
through
a
hole
of
half
that
diameter
she
knows
how
to
manage
it
because
the
wren
tribe
have
handled
twigs
so
long
in
building
their
nests
that
this
knowledge
has
become
a
family
instinct
what
we
call
the
intelligence
of
animals
is
limited
for
the
most
part
to
sense
perception
and
sense
memory
we
teach
them
certain
things
train
them
to
do
tricks
quite
beyond
the
range
of
their
natural
intelligence
not
because
we
enlighten
their
minds
or
develop
their
reason
but
mainly
by
the
force
of
habit
through
repetition
the
act
becomes
automatic
who
ever
saw
a
trained
animal
unless
it
be
the
elephant
do
anything
that
betrayed
the
least
spark
of
conscious
intelligence
the
trained
pig
or
the
trained
dog
or
the
trained
lion
does
its
stunt
precisely
as
a
machine
would
do
it
without
any
more
appreciation
of
what
it
is
doing
the
trainer
and
public
performer
find
that
things
must
always
be
done
in
the
same
fixed
order
any
change
anything
unusual
any
strange
sound
light
color
or
movement
and
trouble
at
once
ensues
i
read
of
a
beaver
that
cut
down
a
tree
which
was
held
in
such
a
way
that
it
did
not
fall
but
simply
dropped
down
the
height
of
the
stump
the
beaver
cut
it
off
again
again
it
dropped
and
refused
to
fall
he
cut
it
off
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
still
the
tree
stood
then
he
gave
it
up
now
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
independent
intelligence
the
animal
showed
was
when
it
ceased
to
cut
off
the
tree
had
it
been
a
complete
automaton
it
would
have
gone
on
cutting
would
it
not
till
it
made
of
the
whole
tree
it
was
confronted
by
a
new
problem
and
after
a
while
it
took
the
hint
of
course
it
did
not
understand
what
was
the
matter
as
you
and
i
would
have
but
it
evidently
concluded
that
something
was
wrong
was
this
of
itself
an
act
of
intelligence
though
it
may
be
that
its
ceasing
to
cut
off
the
tree
was
simply
the
result
of
discouragement
and
involved
no
mental
conclusion
at
all
it
is
a
new
problem
a
new
condition
that
tests
an
animal
intelligence
how
long
it
takes
a
caged
bird
or
beast
to
learn
that
it
can
not
escape
what
a
man
would
see
at
a
glance
it
takes
weeks
or
months
to
pound
into
the
captive
bird
or
squirrel
or
coon
when
the
prisoner
ceases
to
struggle
it
is
probably
not
because
it
has
at
last
come
to
understand
the
situation
but
because
it
is
discouraged
it
is
checked
but
not
enlightened
even
so
careful
an
observer
as
gilbert
white
credits
the
swallow
with
an
act
of
judgment
to
which
it
is
not
entitled
he
says
that
in
order
that
the
mud
nest
may
not
advance
too
rapidly
and
so
fall
of
its
own
weight
the
bird
works
at
it
only
in
the
morning
and
plays
and
feeds
the
rest
of
the
day
thus
giving
the
mud
a
chance
to
harden
had
not
the
genial
parson
observed
that
this
is
the
practice
of
all
birds
during
that
they
work
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
feed
and
amuse
themselves
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
case
of
the
this
interim
of
course
gives
the
mud
a
chance
to
harden
but
are
we
justified
in
crediting
them
with
this
forethought
such
skill
and
intelligence
as
a
bird
seems
to
display
in
the
building
of
its
nest
and
yet
at
times
such
stupidity
i
have
known
a
to
start
four
nests
at
once
and
work
more
or
less
upon
all
of
them
she
had
deserted
the
ancestral
sites
under
the
shelving
rocks
and
come
to
a
new
porch
upon
the
plate
of
which
she
started
her
four
nests
she
blundered
because
her
race
had
had
little
or
no
experience
with
porches
there
were
four
or
more
places
upon
the
plate
just
alike
and
whichever
one
of
these
she
chanced
to
strike
with
her
loaded
beak
she
regarded
as
the
right
one
her
instinct
served
her
up
to
a
certain
point
but
it
did
not
enable
her
to
discriminate
between
those
rafters
where
a
little
original
intelligence
should
have
come
into
play
she
was
deficient
her
progenitors
had
built
under
rocks
where
there
was
little
chance
for
mistakes
of
this
sort
and
they
had
learned
through
ages
of
experience
to
blend
the
nest
with
its
surroundings
by
the
use
of
moss
the
better
to
conceal
it
my
phoebe
brought
her
moss
to
the
new
timbers
of
the
porch
where
it
had
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
what
it
had
under
the
gray
mossy
rocks
i
was
amused
at
the
case
of
a
robin
that
recently
came
to
my
knowledge
the
bird
built
its
nest
in
the
south
end
of
a
rude
shed
that
covered
a
table
at
a
railroad
terminus
upon
which
a
locomotive
was
frequently
turned
when
her
end
of
the
shed
was
turned
to
the
north
she
built
another
nest
in
the
temporary
south
end
and
as
the
reversal
of
the
shed
ends
continued
from
day
to
day
she
soon
had
two
nests
with
two
sets
of
eggs
when
i
last
heard
from
her
she
was
consistently
sitting
on
that
particular
nest
which
happened
to
be
for
the
time
being
in
the
end
of
the
shed
facing
toward
the
south
the
bewildered
bird
evidently
had
had
no
experience
with
the
tricks
of
an
intelligent
man
once
told
me
that
crabs
could
reason
and
this
was
his
proof
in
hunting
for
crabs
in
shallow
water
he
found
one
that
had
just
cast
its
shell
but
the
crab
put
up
just
as
brave
a
fight
as
ever
though
of
course
it
was
powerless
to
inflict
any
pain
as
soon
as
the
creature
found
that
its
bluff
game
did
not
work
it
offered
no
further
resistance
now
i
should
as
soon
say
a
wasp
reasoned
because
a
stingless
drone
or
male
when
you
capture
him
will
make
all
the
motions
with
its
body
curving
and
thrusting
that
its
fellows
do
this
action
is
from
an
inherited
instinct
and
is
purely
automatic
the
wasp
is
not
putting
up
a
bluff
game
it
is
really
trying
to
sting
you
but
has
not
the
weapon
the
crab
quickly
reacts
at
your
approach
as
is
its
nature
to
do
and
then
quickly
ceases
its
defense
because
in
its
enfeebled
condition
the
impulse
of
defense
is
feeble
also
its
surrender
was
on
physiological
not
upon
rational
grounds
thus
do
we
without
thinking
impute
the
higher
faculties
to
even
the
lowest
forms
of
animal
life
much
in
our
own
lives
is
purely
automatic
the
quick
reaction
to
appropriate
stimuli
as
when
we
ward
off
a
blow
or
dodge
a
missile
or
make
ourselves
agreeable
to
the
opposite
sex
and
much
also
is
inherited
or
unconsciously
imitative
because
man
then
is
half
animal
shall
we
say
that
the
animal
is
half
man
this
seems
to
be
the
logic
of
some
people
the
animal
man
while
retaining
much
of
his
animality
has
evolved
from
it
higher
faculties
and
attributes
while
our
kindred
have
not
thus
progressed
man
is
undoubtedly
of
animal
origin
but
his
rise
occurred
when
the
principle
of
variation
was
much
more
active
when
the
forms
and
forces
of
nature
were
much
more
youthful
and
plastic
when
the
seething
and
fermenting
of
the
vital
fluids
were
at
a
high
pitch
in
the
far
past
and
it
was
high
tide
with
the
creative
impulse
the
world
is
aging
and
no
doubt
the
power
of
initiative
in
nature
is
becoming
less
and
less
i
think
it
safe
to
say
that
the
worm
no
longer
aspires
to
be
man
x
a
pinch
of
salt
probably
i
have
become
unusually
cautious
of
late
about
accepting
offhand
all
i
read
in
print
on
subjects
of
natural
history
i
take
much
of
it
with
a
liberal
pinch
of
salt
newspaper
reading
tends
to
make
one
cautious
and
who
does
not
read
newspapers
in
these
days
one
of
my
critics
says
apropos
of
certain
recent
strictures
of
mine
upon
some
current
nature
writers
that
i
discredit
whatever
i
have
not
myself
seen
that
i
belong
to
that
class
of
observers
whose
is
narrowed
to
the
limit
of
their
own
personal
experience
this
were
a
grievous
fault
if
it
were
true
so
much
we
have
to
take
upon
trust
in
natural
history
as
well
as
in
other
history
and
in
life
in
general
burroughs
might
have
remembered
says
another
critic
discussing
the
same
subject
that
nobody
has
seen
quite
so
many
things
as
everybody
how
true
if
i
have
ever
been
guilty
of
denying
the
truth
of
what
everybody
has
seen
my
critic
has
just
ground
for
complaint
i
was
conscious
in
the
paper
referred
to
of
denying
only
the
truth
of
certain
things
that
one
man
alone
had
reported
having
seen
things
so
at
variance
not
only
with
my
own
observations
but
with
those
of
all
other
observers
and
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
animal
psychology
that
my
will
to

i
shall
your

sharply
if

tell

you
have

apples

the

i

such

have

or
if

that
you
have

an
old
doe
with
horns
or
a
hen
with
spurs
or
a
male
bird
incubating
and
singing
on
the
nest
unusual
as
the
last
occurrence
is
i
shall
not
dispute
you
i
will
concede
that
you
may
have
seen
a
white
crow
or
a
white
blackbird
or
a

robin
or
a
black
chipmunk
or
a

red

and
many
other
departures
from
the
usual
in
animal
life
but
i
can
not
share
the
conviction
of
the
man
who
told
me
he
had
seen
a
red
squirrel
curing
rye
before
storing
it
up
in
its
den
or
of
the
writer
who
believes
the
fox
will
ride
upon
the

of
a
sheep
to
escape
the
hound
or
of
another
writer
that
he
has
seen
the
blue
heron
chumming

even
if
you
aver
that
you
have

a
woodpecker
running
down

trunk
of
a

as
well
as
up

shall
be
sure
you
have
not

correctly
it
is
the
nuthatch

not
the

that
hops
up

down

around

it
is
easy
to
transcend
any
experience
not
so
easy
to
transcend
his
reason
nobody
has
seen
so
many
things
as
everybody
yet
a
dozen
men
can
not
see
any
farther
than
one
and
the
truth
is
not
often
a
matter
of
majorities
if
you
tell
me
any
incident
in
the
life
of
bird
or
beast
that
implies
the
possession
of
what
we
mean
by
reason
i
shall
be
very
skeptical
am
i
guilty
then
as
has
been
charged
of
preferring
the
deductive
method
of
reasoning
to
the
more
modern
and
more
scientific
inductive
method
but
i
doubt
if
the
inductive
method
would
avail
one
in
trying
to
prove
that
the
old
cow
really
jumped
over
the
moon
we
do
deny
certain
things
upon
general
principles
and
affirm
others
i
do
not
believe
that
a
rooster
ever
laid
an
egg
or
that
a
male
tiger
ever
gave
milk
if
your
alleged
fact
contradicts
fundamental
principles
i
shall
beware
of
it
if
it
contradicts
universal
experience
i
shall
probe
it
thoroughly
a
college
professor
wrote
me
that
he
had
seen
a
crow
blackbird
catch
a
small
fish
and
fly
away
with
it
in
its
beak
now
i
have
never
seen
anything
of
the
kind
but
i
know
of
no
principle
upon
which
i
should
feel
disposed
to
question
the
truth
of
such
an
assertion
i
have
myself
seen
a
crow
blackbird
kill
an
english
sparrow
both
proceedings
i
think
are
very
unusual
but
neither
is
antecedently
improbable
if
the
professor
had
said
that
he
saw
the
blackbird
dive
head
first
into
the
water
for
the
fish
after
the
manner
of
the
kingfisher
i
should
have
been
very
skeptical
he
only
saw
the
bird
rise
up
from
the
edge
of
the
water
with
the
wriggling
fish
in
its
mouth
it
had
doubtless
seized
it
in
shallow
water
near
the
shore
but
i
should
discredit
upon
general
principles
the
statement
of
the
woman
who
related
with
much
detail
how
she
and
her
whole
family
had
seen
a
pair
of
small
brown
birds
carry
their
young
from
their
nest
in
a
low
bush
where
there
was
danger
from
cats
to
a
new
nest
which
they
had
just
finished
in
the
top
of
a
tree
could
any
person
who
knows
the
birds
credit
such
a
tale
the
throws
out
the
counterfeit
coin
or
bill
because
his
practiced
eye
and
touch
detect
the
fraud
at
once
on
similar
grounds
the
experienced
observer
rejects
all
such
stories
as
the
above
darwin
quotes
an
authority
for
the
statement
that
our
ruffed
grouse
makes
its
drumming
sound
by
striking
its
wings
together
over
its
back
a
recent
writer
says
the
sound
is
not
made
with
the
wings
at
all
but
is
made
with
the
voice
just
as
a
rooster
crows
every
woodsman
knows
that
neither
statement
is
true
and
he
knows
it
not
on
general
principles
but
from
experience
he
has
seen
the
grouse
drum
birds
that
are
not
flycatchers
sometimes
take
insects
in
the
air
they
do
it
clumsily
but
they
get
the
bug
on
the
other
hand
flycatchers
sometimes
eat
fruit
i
have
seen
the
kingbird
carry
off
raspberries
all
such
facts
are
matters
of
observation
in
the
search
for
truth
we
employ
both
the
deductive
and
the
inductive
methods
we
deduce
principles
from
facts
and
we
test
alleged
facts
by
principles
the
other
day
an
intelligent
woman
told
me
this
about
a
the
bird
had
a
nest
with
young
in
the
corner
of
her
cage
near
by
were
some
other
birds
in
a
cage
i
forget
what
they
were
they
had
a
full
view
of
all
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
canary
this
publicity
she
evidently
did
not
like
for
she
tore
out
of
the
paper
that
covered
the
bottom
of
her
cage
a
piece
as
large
as
one
hand
and
wove
it
into
the
wires
so
as
to
make
a
screen
against
her
inquisitive
neighbors
my
informant
evidently
believed
this
story
it
was
agreeable
to
her
fancies
and
feelings
but
see
the
difficulties
in
the
way
how
could
the
bird
with
its
beak
tear
out
a
broad
piece
of
paper
then
how
could
it
weave
it
into
the
wires
of
its
cage
furthermore
the
family
of
birds
to
which
the
canary
belongs
are
not
weavers
they
build
nests
and
they
have
had
no
use
for
screens
or
covers
and
they
never
have
made
them
just
what
was
the
truth
about
the
matter
i
can
not
say
but
if
we
know
anything
about
animal
psychology
we
know
that
was
not
the
truth
it
is
always
risky
to
attribute
to
an
animal
any
act
its
ancestors
could
not
have
performed
again
things
are
reported
as
facts
that
are
not
so
much
contrary
to
reason
as
contrary
to
all
experience
and
with
these
too
i
have
my
difficulties
a
recent
writer
upon
our
wild
life
says
he
has
discovered
that
the
cowbird
watches
over
its
young
and
assists
the
in
providing
food
for
them
an
observation
so
contrary
to
all
that
we
know
of
parasitical
birds
both
at
home
and
abroad
that
no
real
observer
can
credit
the
statement
our
cowbird
has
been
under
observation
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
every
dweller
in
the
country
must
see
one
or
more
young
cowbirds
being
fed
by
their
every
season
yet
no
competent
observer
has
ever
reported
any
care
of
the
young
bird
by
its
real
parent
if
this
were
true
it
would
make
the
cowbird
only
half
parasitical
an
phenomenon
the
same
writer
tells
this
incident
about
a
grouse
that
had
a
nest
near
his
cabin
one
morning
he
heard
a
strange
cry
in
the
direction
of
the
nest
and
taking
the
path
that
led
to
it
he
met
the
grouse
running
toward
him
with
one
wing
pressed
close
to
her
side
and
fighting
off
two
robber
crows
with
the
other
under
the
closed
wing
the
grouse
was
carrying
an
egg
which
she
had
managed
to
save
from
the
ruin
of
her
nest
the
bird
was
coming
to
the
hermit
for
succor
now
am
i
skeptical
about
such
a
story
put
down
in
apparent
good
faith
in
a
book
of
natural
history
as
a
real
occurrence
because
i
have
never
seen
the
like
no
i
am
skeptical
because
the
incident
is
so
contrary
to
all
that
we
know
about
grouse
and
all
other
wild
birds
our
belief
in
nearly
all
matters
takes
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
it
is
easier
for
me
to
believe
that
the
writer
deceived
himself
than
that
such
a
thing
ever
happened
in
the
first
place
a
grouse
could
not
pick
up
an
egg
with
her
wing
when
crows
were
trying
to
rob
her
and
in
the
second
place
she
would
not
think
far
enough
to
do
it
if
she
had
the
power
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
the
egg
bring
it
to
the
hermit
for
his
breakfast
this
last
supposition
is
just
as
reasonable
as
any
part
of
the
story
a
grouse
will
not
readily
leave
her
unfledged
young
but
she
will
leave
her
eggs
when
disturbed
by
man
or
beast
with
apparent
unconcern
it
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
that
real
observers
see
any
of
these
startling
and
exceptional
things
in
nature
thoreau
saw
none
white
saw
none
charles
john
saw
none
john
muir
reports
none
audubon
none
it
is
always
your
untrained
observer
that
has
his
poser
his
shower
of
frogs
or
lizards
or
his
hoop
snakes
and
the
like
the
impossible
things
that
country
people
see
or
hear
of
would
make
a
book
of
wonders
in
some
places
fishermen
believe
that
the
loon
carries
its
egg
under
its
wing
till
it
hatches
and
one
would
say
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
know
so
they
are
but
opportunity
is
only
half
the
problem
the
verifying
mind
is
the
other
half
one
of
our
writers
of
popular
nature
books
relates
this
curious
incident
of
animal
surgery
among
wild
ducks
he
discovered
two
eider
ducks
swimming
about
a
pond
and
acting
queerly
dipping
their
heads
under
water
and
keeping
them
there
for
a
minute
or
more
at
a
time
he
later
discovered
that
the
ducks
had
large
mussels
attached
to
their
tongues
and
that
they
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
them
by
drowning
them
the
birds
had
discovered
that
the
mussel
can
not
live
in
fresh
water
now
am
i
to
accept
this
story
without
question
because
i
find
it
printed
in
a
book
in
the
first
place
is
it
not
most
remarkable
that
if
the
ducks
had
discovered
that
the
bivalves
could
not
live
in
fresh
water
they
should
not
also
have
discovered
that
they
could
not
live
in
the
air
in
fact
that
they
would
die
as
soon
in
the
air
as
in
the
fresh
water
see
how
much
trouble
the
ducks
could
have
saved
themselves
by
going
and
sitting
quietly
upon
the
beach
or
putting
their
heads
under
their
wings
and
going
to
sleep
on
the
wave
oysters
are
often
laid
down
in
fresh
water
to
fatten
before
being
sent
to
market
and
probably
mussels
would
thrive
for
a
short
time
in
fresh
water
equally
well
in
the
second
place
a
duck
tongue
is
a
very
short
and
stiff
affair
and
is
fixed
in
the
lower
mandible
as
in
a
trough
ducks
do
not
protrude
the
tongue
when
they
feed
they
can
not
protrude
it
and
if
a
duck
can
crush
a
with
its
beak
what
better
position
could
it
have
the
bivalve
in
than
fast
to
the
tongue
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
mandible
the
story
is
certainly
a
very
fishy
one
in
all
such
cases
the
mind
follows
the
line
of
least
resistance
if
the
ducks
were
deliberately
holding
their
bills
under
water
it
is
easier
to
believe
that
they
did
it
because
they
thereby
found
some
relief
from
pain
than
that
they
knew
the
bivalves
would
let
go
their
hold
sooner
in
fresh
water
than
in
salt
or
than
in
the
air
a
duck
mouth
held
open
and
the
tongue
pinched
by
a
would
doubtless
soon
be
in
a
feverish
and
abnormal
condition
which
cool
water
would
tend
to
alleviate
one
is
unable
to
see
how
the
ducks
could
have
acquired
the
kind
of
human
experimental
knowledge
attributed
to
them
a
person
might
learn
such
a
secret
but
surely
not
a
duck
in
discovering
and
in
eluding
its
enemies
and
in
many
other
ways
the
duck
wits
are
very
sharp
but
to
attribute
to
them
a
knowledge
of
the
virtues
of
fresh
water
over
salt
in
a
certain
unusual
emergency
an
emergency
that
could
not
have
occurred
to
the
race
of
ducks
much
less
to
individuals
often
enough
for
a
special
instinct
to
have
been
developed
to
meet
it
is
to
make
them
entirely
human
i
have
tried
the
experiment
on
two
ordinary
clams
and
they
both
died
on
the
third
day
the
whole
idea
of
animal
surgery
which
the
incident
implies
such
as
mending
broken
legs
with
clay
salving
wounds
with
pitch
or
resorting
to
bandages
or
amputations
is
preposterous
sick
or
wounded
animals
will
often
seek
relief
from
pain
by
taking
to
the
water
or
to
the
mud
or
maybe
to
the
snow
just
as
cows
will
seek
the
pond
or
the
bushes
to
escape
the
heat
and
the
flies
and
that
is
about
the
extent
of
their
surgery
the
dog
licks
his
wound
it
no
doubt
soothes
and
relieves
it
the
cow
licks
her
calf
she
licks
him
into
shape
it
is
her
instinct
to
do
so
that
tongue
of
hers
is
a
currycomb
plus
warmth
and
moisture
and
flexibility
the
cat
always
carries
her
kittens
by
the
back
of
the
neck
it
is
her
best
way
to
carry
them
though
i
do
not
suppose
this
act
is
the
result
of
experiment
on
her
part
a
chimney
swift
has
taken
up
her
abode
in
my
study
chimney
at
intervals
day
or
night
when
she
hears
me
in
the
room
she
makes
a
sudden
flapping
and
drumming
sound
with
her
wings
to
scare
me
away
it
is
a
very
pretty
little
trick
and
quite
amusing
if
you
appear
above
the
opening
of
the
top
of
a
chimney
where
a
swift
is
sitting
on
her
nest
she
will
try
to
drum
you
away
in
the
same
manner
i
do
not
suppose
there
is
any
thought
or
calculation
in
her
behavior
any
more
than
there
is
in
her
or
any
other
of
her
instinctive
doings
it
is
probably
as
much
a
reflex
act
as
that
of
a
bird
when
she
turns
her
eggs
or
feigns
lameness
or
paralysis
to
lure
you
away
from
her
nest
or
as
the
playing
possum
of
a
or
when
it
is
disturbed
one
of
the
writers
referred
to
above
relates
with
much
detail
this
astonishing
thing
of
the
canada
lynx
he
saw
a
pack
of
them
trailing
their
game
a
hare
through
the
winter
woods
not
only
hunting
in
concert
but
tracking
their
quarry
now
any
candid
and
informed
reader
will
balk
at
this
story
for
two
reasons
the
cat
tribe
do
not
hunt
by
scent
but
by
sight
they
stalk
or
waylay
their
game
they
hunt
singly
they
are
all
solitary
in
their
habits
they
are
probably
the
most
unsocial
of
the
carnivora
they
prowl
they
listen
they
bide
their
time
wolves
often
hunt
in
packs
i
have
no
evidence
that
foxes
do
and
if
the
cats
ever
do
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
departure
a
statement
of
such
an
exceptional
occurrence
should
always
put
one
on
his
guard
in
the
same
story
the
lynx
is
represented
as
making
curious
antics
in
the
air
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
a
band
of
caribou
and
thus
lure
one
of
them
to
its
death
at
the
teeth
and
claws
of
the
waiting
hidden
pack
this
also
is
so
uncatlike
a
proceeding
that
no
woodsman
could
ever
credit
it
hunters
on
the
plains
sometimes
flag
deer
and
antelope
and
i
have
seen
even
a
loon
drawn
very
near
to
a
bather
in
the
water
who
was
waving
a
small
red
flag
but
none
of
our
wild
creatures
use
lures
or
decoys
or
disguises
this
would
involve
a
process
of
reasoning
quite
beyond
them
many
instances
have
been
recorded
of
animals
seeking
the
protection
of
man
when
pursued
by
their
deadly
enemies
i
heard
of
a
rat
which
when
hunted
by
a
weasel
rushed
into
a
room
where
a
man
was
sleeping
and
took
refuge
in
the
bed
at
his
feet
i
heard
thompson
seton
tell
of
a
young
pronghorn
buck
that
was
vanquished
by
a
rival
and
so
hotly
pursued
by
its
antagonist
that
it
sought
shelter
amid
his
horses
and
wagons
on
another
occasion
seton
said
a
jack
rabbit
pursued
by
a
weasel
upon
the
snow
sought
safety
under
his
sled
in
all
such
cases
if
the
frightened
animal
really
rushed
to
man
for
protection
that
act
would
show
a
degree
of
reason
the
animal
must
think
and
weigh
the
and
but
i
am
convinced
that
the
truth
about
such
cases
is
this
the
greater
fear
drives
out
the
lesser
fear
the
animal
loses
its
head
and
becomes
oblivious
to
everything
but
the
enemy
that
is
pursuing
it
the
rat
was
so
terrified
at
the
demon
of
a
weasel
that
it
had
but
one
impulse
and
that
was
to
hide
somewhere
doubtless
had
the
bed
been
empty
it
would
have
taken
refuge
there
just
the
same
how
could
an
animal
know
that
a
man
will
protect
it
on
special
occasions
when
ordinarily
it
has
exactly
the
opposite
feeling
a
deer
hotly
pursued
by
a
hound
might
rush
into
the
or
into
the
open
door
of
the
barn
in
sheer
desperation
of
uncontrollable
terror
then
we
should
say
the
creature
knew
the
farmer
would
protect
it
and
every
woman
who
read
the
incident
and
half
the
men
would
believe
that
that
thought
was
in
the
deer
mind
when
the
hunted
deer
rushes
into
the
lake
or
pond
it
does
so
of
course
with
a
view
to
escape
its
pursuers
and
wherever
it
seeks
refuge
this
is
its
sole
purpose
i
can
easily
fancy
a
bird
pursued
by
a
hawk
darting
into
an
open
door
or
window
not
with
the
thought
that
the
inmates
of
the
house
will
protect
it
but
in
a
panic
of
absolute
terror
its
fear
is
then
centred
upon
something
behind
it
not
in
front
of
it
when
an
animal
does
something
necessary
to
its
or
to
the
continuance
of
its
species
it
probably
does
not
think
about
it
as
a
person
would
any
more
than
the
plant
or
tree
thinks
about
the
light
when
it
bends
toward
it
or
about
the
moisture
when
it
sends
down
its
touch
the
tail
of
a
porcupine
ever
so
lightly
and
it
springs
up
like
a
trap
and
your
hand
is
stuck
with
quills
i
do
not
suppose
there
is
any
more
thinking
about
the
act
or
any
more
conscious
exercise
of
than
there
is
in
a
trap
an
outward
stimulus
is
applied
and
the
reaction
is
quick
does
not
man
wink
and
dodge
and
sneeze
and
laugh
and
cry
and
blush
and
fall
in
love
and
do
many
other
things
without
thought
or
will
i
do
not
suppose
the
birds
think
about
migrating
as
man
does
when
he
migrates
they
simply
obey
an
inborn
impulse
to
move
south
or
north
as
the
case
may
be
they
do
not
think
about
the
great
lights
upon
the
coast
that
blaze
out
with
a
fatal
fascination
in
their
midnight
paths
if
they
had
independent
powers
of
thought
they
would
avoid
them
but
the
lighthouse
is
comparatively
a
new
thing
in
the
life
of
birds
and
instinct
has
not
yet
taught
them
to
avoid
it
to
adapt
means
to
an
end
is
an
act
of
intelligence
but
that
intelligence
may
be
inborn
and
instinctive
as
in
the
animals
or
it
may
be
acquired
and
therefore
rational
as
in
man
surely
said
a
woman
to
me
when
a
cat
sits
watching
at
a
she
has
some
image
in
her
mind
of
the
mouse
in
its
hole
not
in
any
such
sense
as
we
have
when
we
think
of
the
same
subject
the
cat
has
either
seen
the
mouse
go
into
the
hole
or
else
she
smells
him
she
knows
he
is
there
through
her
senses
and
she
reacts
to
that
impression
her
instinct
prompts
her
to
hunt
and
to
catch
mice
she
does
need
to
think
about
them
as
we
do
about
the
game
we
hunt
nature
has
done
that
for
her
in
the
shape
of
an
inborn
impulse
that
is
awakened
by
the
sight
or
smell
of
mice
we
have
no
ready
way
to
describe
her
act
as
she
sits
intently
by
the
hole
but
to
say
the
cat
thinks
there
is
a
mouse
there
while
she
is
not
thinking
at
all
but
simply
watching
prompted
to
it
by
her
inborn
instinct
for
mice
the
cow
mouth
will
water
at
the
sight
of
her
food
when
she
is
hungry
is
she
thinking
about
it
no
more
than
you
are
when
your
mouth
waters
as
your
full
is
set
down
before
you
certain
desires
and
appetites
are
aroused
through
sight
and
smell
without
any
mental
cognition
the
sexual
relations
of
the
animals
also
illustrate
this
fact
we
know
that
the
animals
do
not
think
in
any
proper
sense
as
we
do
or
have
concepts
and
ideas
because
they
have
no
language
to
be
sure
a
deaf
mute
thinks
without
language
because
a
human
being
has
the
intelligence
which
language
implies
or
which
was
begotten
in
his
ancestors
by
its
use
through
long
ages
not
so
with
the
lower
animals
they
are
like
very
young
children
in
this
respect
they
have
impressions
perceptions
emotions
but
not
ideas
the
child
perceives
things
discriminates
things
knows
its
mother
from
a
stranger
is
angry
or
glad
or
afraid
long
before
it
has
any
language
or
any
proper
concepts
animals
know
only
through
their
senses
and
this
knowledge
is
restricted
to
things
present
in
time
and
space
reflection
or
a
return
upon
themselves
in
thought
of
this
they
are
not
capable
their
only
language
consists
of
various
cries
and
calls
expressions
of
pain
alarm
joy
love
anger
they
communicate
with
one
another
and
come
to
share
one
another
mental
or
emotional
states
through
these
cries
and
calls
a
dog
barks
in
various
tones
and
keys
each
of
which
expresses
a
different
feeling
in
the
dog
i
can
always
tell
when
my
dog
is
barking
at
a
snake
there
is
something
peculiar
in
the
tone
the
hunter
knows
when
his
hound
has
driven
the
fox
to
hole
by
a
change
in
his
baying
the
lowing
and
bellowing
of
horned
cattle
are
expressions
of
several
different
things
the
crow
has
many
caws
that
no
doubt
convey
various
meanings
the
cries
of
alarm
and
distress
of
the
birds
are
understood
by
all
the
wild
creatures
that
hear
them
a
feeling
of
alarm
is
conveyed
to
them
an
emotion
not
an
idea
how
could
a
crow
tell
his
fellows
of
some
future
event
or
of
some
experience
of
the
day
how
could
he
tell
him
this
thing
is
dangerous
this
is
harmless
save
by
his
actions
in
the
presence
of
those
things
or
how
tell
of
a
newly
found
food
supply
save
by
flying
eagerly
to
it
a
fox
or
a
wolf
could
warn
its
fellow
of
the
danger
of
poisoned
meat
by
showing
alarm
in
the
presence
of
the
meat
such
meat
would
no
doubt
have
a
peculiar
odor
to
the
keen
scent
of
the
fox
or
the
wolf
animals
that
live
in
communities
such
as
bees
and
beavers
coöperate
with
each
other
without
language
because
they
form
a
sort
of
organic
unity
and
what
one
feels
all
the
others
feel
one
spirit
one
purpose
fills
the
community
it
is
said
on
good
authority
that
will
not
permit
weeds
or
tall
grass
to
grow
about
their
burrows
as
these
afford
cover
for
coyotes
and
other
enemies
to
stalk
them
if
they
can
not
remove
these
screens
they
will
leave
the
place
and
yet
they
will
sometimes
allow
a
weed
such
as
the
norse
nettle
or
the
mexican
poppy
to
grow
on
the
mound
at
the
mouth
of
the
den
where
it
will
afford
shade
and
not
obstruct
the
view
at
first
thought
this
conduct
may
look
like
a
matter
of
calculation
and
forethought
but
it
is
doubtless
the
result
of
an
instinct
that
has
been
developed
in
the
tribe
by
the
struggle
for
existence
and
with
any
given
rodent
is
quite
independent
of
experience
it
is
an
inherited
fear
of
every
weed
or
tuft
of
grass
that
might
conceal
an
enemy
i
am
told
that
prairie
wolves
will
dig
up
and
eat
meat
that
has
been
poisoned
and
then
buried
when
they
will
not
touch
it
if
left
on
the
surface
in
such
a
case
the
ranchmen
think
the
wolf
has
been
outwitted
but
the
truth
probably
is
that
there
was
no
calculation
in
the
matter
the
soil
drew
out
or
dulled
the
smell
of
the
poison
and
of
the
man
hand
and
so
allayed
the
wolf
suspicions
i
suppose
that
when
an
animal
practices
deception
as
when
a
bird
feigns
lameness
or
a
broken
wing
to
decoy
you
away
from
her
nest
or
her
young
it
is
quite
unconscious
of
the
act
it
takes
no
thought
about
the
matter
in
trying
to
call
a
hen
to
his
side
a
rooster
will
often
make
believe
he
has
food
in
his
beak
when
the
pretended
grain
or
insect
may
be
only
a
pebble
or
a
bit
of
stick
he
picks
it
up
and
then
drops
it
in
sight
of
the
hen
and
calls
her
in
his
most
persuasive
manner
i
do
not
suppose
that
in
such
cases
the
rooster
is
conscious
of
the
fraud
he
is
practicing
his
instinct
under
such
circumstances
is
to
pick
up
food
and
call
the
attention
of
the
hen
to
it
and
when
no
food
is
present
he
instinctively
picks
up
a
pebble
or
a
stick
his
main
purpose
is
to
get
the
hen
near
him
and
not
to
feed
her
when
he
is
intent
only
on
feeding
her
he
never
offers
her
a
stone
instead
of
bread
we
have
only
to
think
of
the
animals
as
habitually
in
a
condition
analogous
to
or
identical
with
the
unthinking
and
involuntary
character
of
much
of
our
own
lives
they
are
creatures
of
routine
they
are
wholly
immersed
in
the
unconscious
involuntary
nature
out
of
which
we
rise
and
above
which
our
higher
lives
go
on
xi
the
literary
treatment
of
nature
the
literary
treatment
of
natural
history
themes
is
of
course
quite
different
from
the
scientific
treatment
and
should
be
so
the
former
compared
with
the
latter
is
like
drawing
compared
with
mechanical
drawing
literature
aims
to
give
us
the
truth
in
a
way
to
touch
our
emotions
and
in
some
degree
to
satisfy
the
enjoyment
we
have
in
the
living
reality
the
literary
artist
is
just
as
much
in
love
with
the
fact
as
is
his
scientific
brother
only
he
makes
a
different
use
of
the
fact
and
his
interest
in
it
is
often
of
a
character
his
method
is
synthetic
rather
than
analytic
he
deals
in
general
and
not
in
technical
truths
truths
that
he
arrives
at
in
the
fields
and
woods
and
not
in
the
laboratory
the
observes
and
admires
the
scientific
naturalist
collects
one
brings
home
a
bouquet
from
the
woods
the
other
specimens
for
his
herbarium
the
former
would
enlist
your
sympathies
and
arouse
your
enthusiasm
the
latter
would
add
to
your
store
of
exact
knowledge
the
one
is
just
as
shy
of
or
falsifying
his
facts
as
the
other
only
he
gives
more
than
facts
he
gives
impressions
and
analogies
and
as
far
as
possible
shows
you
the
live
bird
on
the
bough
the
literary
and
the
scientific
treatment
of
the
dog
for
instance
will
differ
widely
not
to
say
radically
but
they
will
not
differ
in
one
being
true
and
the
other
false
each
will
be
true
in
its
own
way
one
will
be
suggestive
and
the
other
exact
one
will
be
strictly
objective
but
literature
is
always
more
or
less
subjective
literature
aims
to
invest
its
subject
with
a
human
interest
and
to
this
end
stirs
our
sympathies
and
emotions
pure
science
aims
to
convince
the
reason
and
the
understanding
alone
note
treatment
of
the
dog
in
a
late
magazine
article
probably
the
best
thing
on
our
comrade
that
english
literature
has
to
show
it
gives
one
pleasure
not
because
it
is
all
true
as
science
is
true
but
because
it
is
so
tender
human
and
sympathetic
without
being
false
to
the
essential
dog
nature
it
does
not
make
the
dog
impossible
things
it
is
not
natural
history
it
is
literature
it
is
not
a
record
of
observations
upon
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
dog
but
reflections
upon
him
and
his
relations
to
man
and
upon
the
many
problems
from
the
human
point
of
view
that
the
dog
must
master
in
a
brief
time
the
distinctions
he
must
figure
out
the
mistakes
he
must
avoid
the
riddles
of
life
he
must
read
in
his
dumb
dog
way
of
course
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
dog
is
not
compelled
in
less
than
five
or
six
weeks
to
get
into
his
mind
taking
shape
within
it
an
image
and
a
satisfactory
conception
of
the
universe
no
nor
in
five
or
six
years
strictly
speaking
he
is
not
capable
of
conceptions
at
all
but
only
of
sense
impressions
his
sure
guide
is
instinct
not
blundering
reason
the
dog
starts
with
a
fund
of
knowledge
which
man
acquires
slowly
and
painfully
but
all
this
does
not
trouble
one
in
reading
of
maeterlinck
dog
our
interest
is
awakened
and
our
sympathies
are
moved
by
seeing
the
world
presented
to
the
dog
as
it
presents
itself
to
us
or
by
putting
ourselves
in
the
dog
place
it
is
not
false
natural
history
it
is
a
fund
of
true
human
sentiment
awakened
by
the
contemplation
of
the
dog
life
and
character
maeterlinck
does
not
ascribe
human
powers
and
capacities
to
his
dumb
friend
the
dog
he
has
no
incredible
tales
of
its
sagacity
and
wit
to
relate
it
is
only
an
ordinary
bull
pup
that
he
describes
but
he
makes
us
love
it
and
through
it
all
other
dogs
by
his
loving
analysis
of
its
trials
and
tribulations
and
its
devotion
to
its
god
man
in
like
manner
in
john
muir
story
of
his
dog
stickeen
a
story
to
go
with
rab
and
his
friends
our
credulity
is
not
once
challenged
our
sympathies
are
deeply
moved
because
our
reason
is
not
in
the
least
outraged
it
is
true
that
muir
makes
his
dog
act
like
a
human
being
under
the
press
of
great
danger
but
the
action
is
not
the
kind
that
involves
reason
it
only
implies
sense
perception
and
the
instinct
of
stickeen
does
as
his
master
bids
him
and
he
is
human
only
in
the
human
emotions
of
fear
despair
joy
that
he
shows
in
egerton
young
book
called
my
dogs
of
the
northland
i
find
much
that
is
interesting
and
several
vivid
dog
portraits
but
young
humanizes
his
dogs
to
a
greater
extent
than
does
either
muir
or
maeterlinck
for
instance
he
makes
his
dog
jack
take
special
delight
in
teasing
the
indian
servant
girl
by
walking
or
lying
upon
her
kitchen
floor
when
she
had
just
cleaned
it
all
in
revenge
for
the
slights
the
girl
had
put
upon
him
and
he
gives
several
instances
of
the
conduct
of
the
dog
which
he
thus
interprets
now
one
can
believe
almost
anything
of
dogs
in
the
way
of
wit
about
their
food
their
safety
and
the
like
but
one
can
not
make
them
so
entirely
human
as
deliberately
to
plan
and
execute
the
kind
of
revenge
here
imputed
to
jack
no
animal
could
appreciate
a
woman
pride
in
a
clean
kitchen
floor
or
see
any
relation
between
the
tracks
which
he
makes
upon
the
floor
and
her
state
of
feeling
toward
himself
young
facts
are
doubtless
all
right
it
is
his
interpretation
of
them
that
is
wrong
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
for
the
animal
story
writer
to
put
himself
inside
the
animal
he
wishes
to
portray
and
tell
how
life
and
the
world
look
from
that
point
of
view
but
he
must
always
be
true
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
to
the
limited
intelligence
for
which
he
speaks
in
the
humanization
of
the
animals
and
of
the
facts
of
natural
history
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
province
of
literature
in
this
field
we
must
recognize
certain
limits
your
facts
are
sufficiently
humanized
the
moment
they
become
interesting
and
they
become
interesting
the
moment
you
relate
them
in
any
way
to
our
lives
or
make
them
suggestive
of
what
we
know
to
be
true
in
other
fields
and
in
our
own
experience
thoreau
made
his
battle
of
the
ants
interesting
because
he
made
it
illustrate
all
the
human
traits
of
courage
fortitude
heroism
burns
mouse
at
once
strikes
a
sympathetic
chord
in
us
without
ceasing
to
be
a
mouse
we
see
ourselves
in
it
to
attribute
human
motives
and
faculties
to
the
animals
is
to
caricature
them
but
to
put
us
in
such
relation
with
them
that
we
feel
their
kinship
that
we
see
their
lives
embosomed
in
the
same
iron
necessity
as
our
own
that
we
see
in
their
minds
a
humbler
manifestation
of
the
same
psychic
power
and
intelligence
that
culminates
and
is
conscious
of
itself
in
man
that
i
take
it
is
the
true
humanization
we
like
to
see
ourselves
in
the
nature
around
us
we
want
in
some
way
to
translate
these
facts
and
laws
of
outward
nature
into
our
own
experiences
to
relate
our
observations
of
bird
or
beast
to
our
own
lives
unless
they
beget
some
human
emotion
in
me
the
emotion
of
the
beautiful
the
sublime
or
appeal
to
my
sense
of
the
fit
the
permanent
unless
what
you
learn
in
the
fields
and
the
woods
corresponds
in
some
way
with
what
i
know
of
my
fellows
i
shall
not
long
be
deeply
interested
in
it
i
do
not
want
the
animals
humanized
in
any
other
sense
they
all
have
human
traits
and
ways
let
those
be
brought
out
their
mirth
their
joy
their
curiosity
their
cunning
their
thrift
their
relations
their
wars
their
loves
and
all
the
springs
of
their
actions
laid
bare
as
far
as
possible
but
i
do
not
expect
my
natural
history
to
back
up
the
ten
commandments
or
to
be
an
illustration
of
the
value
of
and
kindergartens
or
to
afford
a
commentary
upon
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
humanize
your
facts
to
the
extent
of
making
them
interesting
if
you
have
the
art
to
do
it
but
leave
the
dog
a
dog
and
the
a
interpretation
is
a
favorite
word
with
some
recent
nature
writers
it
is
claimed
for
the
literary
naturalist
that
he
interprets
natural
history
the
ways
and
doings
of
the
wild
creatures
are
exaggerated
and
misread
under
the
plea
of
interpretation
now
if
by
interpretation
we
mean
an
answer
to
the
question
what
does
this
mean
or
what
is
the
exact
truth
about
it
then
there
is
but
one
interpretation
of
nature
and
that
is
the
scientific
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
fossils
in
the
rocks
or
of
the
carving
and
sculpturing
of
the
landscape
or
of
a
thousand
and
one
other
things
in
the
organic
and
inorganic
world
about
us
science
alone
can
answer
but
if
we
mean
by
interpretation
an
answer
to
the
inquiry
what
does
this
scene
or
incident
suggest
to
you
how
do
you
feel
about
it
then
we
come
to
what
is
called
the
literary
or
poetic
interpretation
of
nature
which
strictly
speaking
is
no
interpretation
of
nature
at
all
but
an
interpretation
of
the
writer
or
the
poet
himself
the
poet
or
the
essayist
tells
what
the
bird
or
the
tree
or
the
cloud
means
to
him
it
is
himself
therefore
that
is
being
interpreted
what
do
ruskin
writings
upon
nature
interpret
they
interpret
ruskin
his
wealth
of
moral
and
ethical
ideas
and
his
wonderful
imagination
richard
jefferies
tells
us
how
the
flower
or
the
bird
or
the
cloud
is
related
to
his
subjective
life
and
experience
it
means
this
or
that
to
him
it
may
mean
something
entirely
different
to
another
because
he
may
be
bound
to
it
by
a
different
tie
of
association
the
poet
fills
the
lap
of
earth
with
treasures
not
her
own
the
riches
of
his
own
spirit
science
reveals
the
treasures
that
are
her
own
and
arranges
and
appraises
them
strictly
speaking
there
is
not
much
in
natural
history
that
needs
interpreting
we
explain
a
fact
we
interpret
an
oracle
we
explain
the
action
and
relation
of
physical
laws
and
forces
we
interpret
as
well
as
we
can
the
geologic
record
darwin
sought
to
explain
the
origin
of
species
and
to
interpret
many
palæontological
phenomena
we
account
for
animal
behavior
on
rational
grounds
of
animal
psychology
there
is
little
to
interpret
natural
history
is
not
a
cryptograph
to
be
deciphered
it
is
a
series
of
facts
and
incidents
to
be
observed
and
recorded
if
two
wild
animals
such
as
the
beaver
and
the
otter
are
deadly
enemies
there
is
good
reason
for
it
and
when
we
have
found
that
reason
we
have
got
hold
of
a
fact
in
natural
history
the
robins
are
at
enmity
with
the
jays
and
the
crow
blackbirds
and
the
cuckoos
in
the
spring
and
the
reason
is
these
birds
eat
the
eggs
when
we
seek
to
interpret
the
actions
of
the
animals
we
are
i
must
repeat
in
danger
of
running
into
all
kinds
of
anthropomorphic
absurdities
by
reading
their
lives
in
terms
of
our
own
thinking
and
consciousness
a
man
sees
a
flock
of
crows
in
a
tree
in
a
state
of
commotion
now
they
all
caw
then
only
one
master
voice
is
heard
presently
two
or
three
crows
fall
upon
one
of
their
number
and
fell
him
to
the
ground
the
spectator
examines
the
victim
and
finds
him
dead
with
his
eyes
pecked
out
he
interprets
what
he
has
seen
as
a
court
of
justice
the
crows
were
trying
a
criminal
and
having
found
him
guilty
they
proceeded
to
execute
him
the
curious
instinct
which
often
prompts
animals
to
fall
upon
and
destroy
a
member
of
the
flock
that
is
sick
or
hurt
or
blind
is
difficult
of
explanation
but
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
whatever
the
reason
is
the
act
is
not
the
outcome
of
a
judicial
proceeding
in
which
judge
and
jury
and
executioner
all
play
their
proper
part
wild
crows
will
chase
and
maltreat
a
tame
crow
whenever
they
get
a
chance
just
why
it
would
be
hard
to
say
but
the
tame
crow
has
evidently
lost
caste
among
them
i
have
what
i
consider
good
proof
that
a
number
of
skunks
that
were
wintering
together
in
their
den
in
the
ground
fell
upon
and
killed
and
then
partly
devoured
one
of
their
number
that
had
lost
a
foot
in
a
trap
another
man
sees
a
fox
lead
a
hound
over
a
long
railroad
trestle
when
the
hound
is
caught
and
killed
by
a
passing
train
he
interprets
the
fact
as
a
cunning
trick
on
the
part
of
the
fox
to
destroy
his
enemy
a
captive
fox
held
to
his
kennel
by
a
long
chain
was
seen
to
pick
up
an
ear
of
corn
that
had
fallen
from
a
passing
load
chew
it
up
scattering
the
kernels
about
and
then
retire
into
his
kennel
presently
a
fat
hen
attracted
by
the
corn
approached
the
hidden
fox
whereupon
he
rushed
out
and
seized
her
this
was
a
shrewd
trick
on
the
part
of
the
fox
to
capture
a
hen
for
his
dinner
in
this
and
in
the
foregoing
cases
the
observer
supplies
something
from
his
own
mind
that
is
what
he
or
she
would
do
under
like
conditions
true
a
fox
does
not
eat
corn
but
an
idle
one
tied
by
a
chain
might
bite
the
kernels
from
an
ear
in
a
mere
spirit
of
mischief
and
restlessness
as
a
dog
or
puppy
might
and
drop
them
upon
the
ground
a
hen
would
very
likely
be
attracted
by
them
when
the
fox
would
be
quick
to
see
his
chance
some
of
the
older
entomologists
believed
that
in
a
colony
of
ants
and
of
bees
the
members
recognized
one
another
by
means
of
some
secret
sign
or
password
in
all
cases
a
stranger
from
another
colony
is
instantly
detected
and
a
home
member
as
instantly
known
this
sign
or
password
says
burmeister
as
quoted
by
lubbock
serves
to
prevent
any
strange
bee
from
entering
into
the
same
hive
without
being
immediately
detected
and
killed
it
however
sometimes
happens
that
several
hives
have
the
same
signs
when
their
several
members
rob
each
other
with
impunity
in
these
cases
the
bees
whose
hives
suffer
most
alter
their
signs
and
then
can
immediately
detect
their
enemy
the
same
thing
was
thought
to
be
true
of
a
colony
of
ants
others
held
that
the
bees
and
the
ants
knew
one
another
individually
as
men
of
the
same
town
do
would
not
any
serious
student
of
nature
in
our
day
know
in
advance
of
experiment
that
all
this
was
childish
and
absurd
lubbock
showed
by
numerous
experiments
that
bees
and
ants
did
not
recognize
their
friends
or
their
enemies
by
either
of
these
methods
just
how
they
did
do
it
he
could
not
clearly
settle
though
it
seems
as
if
they
were
guided
more
by
the
sense
of
smell
than
by
anything
else
maeterlinck
in
his
life
of
the
bee
has
much
to
say
about
the
spirit
of
the
hive
and
it
does
seem
as
if
there
were
some
mysterious
agent
or
power
at
work
there
that
can
not
be
located
or
defined
this
current
effort
to
interpret
nature
has
led
one
of
the
prophets
of
the
art
to
say
that
in
this
act
of
interpretation
one
must
struggle
against
fact
and
law
to
develop
or
keep
his
own
individuality
this
is
certainly
a
curious
notion
and
i
think
an
unsafe
one
that
the
student
of
nature
must
struggle
against
fact
and
law
must
ignore
or
override
them
in
order
to
give
full
swing
to
his
own
individuality
is
it
himself
then
and
not
the
truth
that
he
is
seeking
to
exploit
in
the
field
of
natural
history
we
have
been
led
to
think
the
point
at
issue
is
not
man
individuality
but
correct
observation
a
true
report
of
the
wild
life
about
us
is
one
to
give
free
rein
to
his
fancy
or
imagination
to
see
animal
life
with
his
vision
and
not
with
his
corporeal
eyesight
to
hear
with
his
transcendental
ear
and
not
through
his
auditory
nerve
this
may
be
all
right
in
fiction
or
romance
or
fable
but
why
call
the
outcome
natural
history
why
set
it
down
as
a
record
of
actual
observation
why
penetrate
the
wilderness
to
interview
indians
trappers
guides
woodsmen
and
thus
seek
to
confirm
your
observations
if
you
have
all
the
while
been
struggling
against
fact
and
law
and
do
not
want
or
need
confirmation
if
nature
study
is
only
to
exploit
your
own
individuality
why
bother
about
what
other
people
have
or
have
not
seen
or
heard
why
in
fact
go
to
the
woods
at
all
why
not
sit
in
your
study
and
invent
your
facts
to
suit
your
fancyings
my
sole
objection
to
the
nature
books
that
are
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
is
that
they
are
put
forth
as
veritable
natural
history
and
thus
mislead
their
readers
they
are
the
result
of
a
successful
struggle
against
fact
and
law
in
a
field
where
fact
and
law
should
be
supreme
no
doubt
that
in
the
practical
affairs
of
life
one
often
has
a
struggle
with
the
fact
if
one
bank
balance
gets
on
the
negative
side
of
the
account
he
must
struggle
to
get
it
back
where
it
belongs
he
may
even
have
the
help
of
the
bank
attorney
to
get
it
there
if
one
has
a
besetting
sin
of
any
kind
he
has
to
struggle
against
that
life
is
a
struggle
anyhow
and
we
are
all
strugglers
struggling
to
put
the
facts
upon
our
side
but
the
only
struggle
the
real
nature
student
has
with
facts
is
to
see
them
as
they
are
and
to
read
them
aright
he
is
just
as
zealous
for
the
truth
as
is
the
man
of
science
in
fact
nature
study
is
only
science
out
of
school
happy
in
the
fields
and
woods
loving
the
flower
and
the
animal
which
it
observes
and
finding
in
them
something
for
the
sentiments
and
the
emotions
as
well
as
for
the
understanding
with
the
nature
student
the
human
interest
in
the
wild
creatures
by
which
i
mean
our
interest
in
them
as
living
struggling
beings
dominates
the
scientific
interest
or
our
interest
in
them
merely
as
subjects
for
comparison
and
classification
gilbert
white
was
a
rare
combination
of
the
nature
student
and
the
man
of
science
and
his
book
is
one
of
the
minor
english
classics
richard
jefferies
was
a
true
nature
lover
but
his
interests
rarely
take
a
scientific
turn
our
thoreau
was
in
love
with
the
natural
but
still
more
in
love
with
the
supernatural
yet
he
prized
the
fact
and
his
books
abound
in
delightful
natural
history
observations
we
have
a
host
of
nature
students
in
our
own
day
bent
on
plucking
out
the
heart
of
every
mystery
in
the
fields
and
woods
some
are
dryly
scientific
some
are
dull
and
prosy
some
are
sentimental
some
are
sensational
and
a
few
are
altogether
admirable
thompson
seton
as
an
artist
and
ranks
by
far
the
highest
in
this
field
but
in
reading
his
works
as
natural
history
one
has
to
be
constantly
on
guard
against
his
romantic
tendencies
the
structure
of
animals
their
colors
their
ornaments
their
distribution
their
migrations
all
have
a
significance
that
science
may
interpret
for
us
if
it
can
but
it
is
the
business
of
every
observer
to
report
truthfully
what
he
sees
and
not
to
confound
his
facts
with
his
theories
why
does
the
cowbird
lay
its
egg
in
another
bird
nest
why
are
these
parasitical
birds
found
the
world
over
who
knows
only
there
seems
to
be
a
parasitical
principle
in
nature
that
runs
all
through
her
works
in
the
vegetable
as
well
as
in
the
animal
kingdom
why
is
the
porcupine
so
tame
and
stupid
because
it
does
not
have
to
hunt
for
its
game
and
is
against
all
comers
the
struggle
of
life
has
not
developed
its
wits
why
are
robins
so
abundant
because
they
are
so
adaptive
both
as
regards
their
food
and
their
they
eat
both
fruit
and
insects
and
will
nest
anywhere
in
trees
sheds
walls
and
on
the
ground
why
is
the
fox
so
cunning
because
the
discipline
of
life
has
made
him
cunning
man
has
probably
always
been
after
his
fur
and
his
subsistence
has
not
been
easily
obtained
if
you
ask
me
why
the
crow
is
so
cunning
i
shall
be
put
to
it
for
an
adequate
answer
it
seems
as
if
nobody
could
ever
have
wanted
his
skin
or
his
carcass
and
his
diet
does
not
compel
him
to
outwit
live
game
as
does
that
of
the
fox
his
jet
black
plumage
exposes
him
alike
winter
and
summer
this
drawback
he
has
had
to
meet
by
added
wit
but
i
can
think
of
no
other
way
in
which
he
is
handicapped
i
do
not
know
that
he
has
any
natural
enemies
yet
he
is
one
of
the
most
suspicious
of
the
fowls
of
the
air
why
is
the
canada
jay
so
much
tamer
than
are
other
jays
they
belong
farther
north
where
they
see
less
of
man
they
are
birds
of
the
wilderness
they
are
often
no
doubt
hard
put
to
it
for
food
their
color
does
not
make
them
conspicuous
all
these
things
no
doubt
tend
to
make
them
more
familiar
than
their
congeners
why
again
the
chickadee
can
be
induced
to
perch
upon
your
hand
and
take
food
from
it
more
readily
than
can
the
nuthatch
or
the
woodpecker
is
a
question
not
so
easily
answered
it
being
a
lesser
bird
it
probably
has
fewer
enemies
than
either
of
the
others
and
its
fear
would
be
less
in
proportion
why
does
the
dog
the
world
over
use
his
nose
in
covering
the
bone
he
is
hiding
and
not
his
paw
is
it
because
his
foot
would
leave
a
scent
that
would
give
his
secret
away
while
his
nose
does
not
he
uses
his
paw
in
digging
the
hole
for
the
bone
but
its
scent
in
this
case
would
be
obliterated
by
his
subsequent
procedure
the
foregoing
is
one
way
to
interpret
or
explain
natural
facts
everything
has
its
reason
to
hit
upon
this
reason
is
to
interpret
it
to
the
understanding
to
interpret
it
to
the
emotions
or
to
the
moral
or
to
the
æsthetic
sense
that
is
another
matter
i
would
not
be
unjust
or
unsympathetic
toward
this
current
tendency
to
exalt
the
lower
animals
into
the
human
sphere
i
would
only
help
my
reader
to
see
things
as
they
are
and
to
stimulate
him
to
love
the
animals
as
animals
and
not
as
men
nothing
is
gained
by
the
best
discipline
of
life
is
that
which
prepares
us
to
face
the
facts
no
matter
what
they
are
such
sweet
companionship
as
one
may
have
with
a
dog
simply
because
he
is
a
dog
and
does
not
invade
your
own
exclusive
sphere
he
is
in
a
way
like
your
youth
come
back
to
you
and
taking
form
all
instinct
and
joy
and
adventure
you
can
ignore
him
and
he
is
not
offended
you
can
reprove
him
and
he
still
loves
you
you
can
hail
him
and
he
bounds
with
joy
you
can
camp
and
tramp
and
ride
with
him
and
his
interest
and
curiosity
and
adventurous
spirit
give
to
the
days
and
the
nights
the
true
holiday
atmosphere
with
him
you
are
alone
and
not
alone
you
have
both
companionship
and
solitude
who
would
have
him
more
human
or
less
canine
he
divines
your
thought
through
his
love
and
feels
your
will
in
the
glance
of
your
eye
he
is
not
a
rational
being
yet
he
is
a
very
susceptible
one
and
touches
us
at
so
many
points
that
we
come
to
look
upon
him
with
a
fraternal
regard
i
suppose
we
should
not
care
much
for
natural
history
as
i
have
before
said
or
for
the
study
of
nature
generally
if
we
did
not
in
some
way
find
ourselves
there
that
is
something
that
is
akin
to
our
own
feelings
methods
and
intelligence
we
have
traveled
that
road
we
find
tokens
of
ourselves
on
every
hand
we
are
stuccoed
with
quadrupeds
and
birds
all
over
as
whitman
says
the
of
the
humblest
animal
if
truly
told
is
profoundly
interesting
if
we
could
know
all
that
befalls
the
slow
moving
turtle
in
the
fields
or
the
toad
that
stumbles
and
fumbles
along
the
roadside
our
sympathies
would
be
touched
and
some
spark
of
real
knowledge
imparted
we
should
not
want
the
lives
of
those
humble
creatures
interpreted
after
the
manner
of
our
sentimental
school
of
nature
study
for
that
were
to
lose
fact
in
fable
that
were
to
give
us
a
stone
when
we
had
asked
for
bread
we
should
want
only
a
truthful
record
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
wise
loving
human
eye
such
a
record
as
say
gilbert
white
or
henry
thoreau
might
have
given
us
how
interesting
white
makes
his
old
turtle
hurrying
to
shelter
when
it
rains
or
seeking
the
shade
of
a
cabbage
leaf
when
the
sun
is
too
hot
or
prancing
about
the
garden
on
tiptoe
in
the
spring
by
five
in
the
morning
when
the
mating
instinct
begins
to
stir
within
him
surely
we
may
see
ourselves
in
the
old
tortoise
in
fact
the
problem
of
the
always
is
to
make
his
subject
interesting
and
yet
keep
strictly
within
the
bounds
of
truth
it
is
always
an
artist
privilege
to
heighten
or
deepen
natural
effects
he
may
paint
us
a
more
beautiful
woman
or
a
more
beautiful
horse
or
a
more
beautiful
landscape
than
we
ever
saw
we
are
not
deceived
even
though
he
outdo
nature
we
know
where
we
stand
and
where
he
stands
we
know
that
this
is
the
power
of
art
if
he
is
writing
an
animal
romance
like
kipling
story
of
the
white
seal
or
like
his
jungle
book
there
will
be
nothing
equivocal
about
it
no
mixture
of
fact
and
fiction
nothing
to
confuse
or
mislead
the
reader
we
know
that
here
is
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
the
light
of
the
spirit
the
facts
are
not
falsified
they
are
transmuted
the
aim
of
art
is
the
beautiful
not
but
the
true
the
aim
of
the
literary
naturalist
is
the
true
not
over
but
through
the
beautiful
you
shall
find
the
exact
facts
in
his
pages
and
you
shall
find
them
possessed
of
some
of
the
allurement
and
suggestiveness
that
they
had
in
the
fields
and
woods
only
thus
does
his
work
attain
to
the
rank
of
literature
xii
a
beaver
reason
one
of
our
natural
historians
thinks
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
man
reason
and
a
beaver
reason
because
he
says
when
a
man
builds
a
dam
he
first
looks
the
ground
over
and
after
due
deliberation
decides
upon
his
plan
and
a
beaver
he
avers
does
the
same
but
the
difference
is
obvious
beavers
under
the
same
conditions
build
the
same
kind
of
dams
and
lodges
and
all
beavers
as
a
rule
do
the
same
instinct
is
uniform
in
its
workings
it
runs
in
a
groove
reason
varies
endlessly
and
makes
endless
mistakes
men
build
various
kinds
of
dams
and
in
various
kinds
of
places
with
various
kinds
of
material
and
for
various
kinds
of
uses
they
exercise
individual
judgment
they
invent
new
ways
and
seek
new
ends
and
of
course
often
fail
every
man
has
his
own
measure
of
reason
be
it
more
or
less
it
is
largely
personal
and
original
with
him
and
frequent
failure
is
the
penalty
he
pays
for
this
gift
but
the
individual
beaver
has
only
the
inherited
intelligence
of
his
kind
with
such
slight
addition
as
his
experience
may
have
given
him
he
learns
to
avoid
traps
but
he
does
not
learn
to
improve
upon
his
dam
or
lodge
building
because
he
does
not
need
to
they
answer
his
purpose
if
he
had
new
and
growing
wants
and
aspirations
like
man
why
then
he
would
no
longer
be
a
beaver
he
reacts
to
outward
conditions
where
man
reflects
and
takes
thought
of
things
his
reason
if
we
prefer
to
call
it
such
is
practically
inerrant
it
is
blind
inasmuch
as
it
is
unconscious
but
it
is
sure
inasmuch
as
it
is
adequate
it
is
a
part
of
living
nature
in
a
sense
that
man
is
not
if
it
makes
a
mistake
it
is
such
a
mistake
as
nature
makes
when
for
instance
a
hen
produces
an
egg
within
an
egg
or
an
egg
without
a
yolk
or
when
more
seeds
germinate
in
the
soil
than
can
grow
into
plants
a
lower
animal
intelligence
i
say
compared
with
man
is
blind
it
does
not
grasp
the
subject
perceived
as
ours
does
when
instinct
perceives
an
object
it
reacts
to
it
or
not
just
as
the
object
is
or
is
not
related
to
its
needs
of
one
kind
or
another
in
many
ways
an
animal
is
like
a
child
what
comes
first
in
the
child
is
simple
perception
and
memory
and
association
of
memories
and
these
make
up
the
main
sum
of
an
animal
intelligence
the
child
goes
on
developing
till
it
reaches
the
power
of
reflection
and
of
generalization
a
stage
of
mentality
that
the
animal
never
attains
to
all
animal
life
is
specialized
each
animal
is
an
expert
in
its
own
line
of
work
the
work
of
its
tribe
beavers
do
the
work
of
beavers
they
cut
down
trees
and
build
dams
and
all
beavers
do
it
alike
and
with
the
same
degree
of
untaught
skill
this
is
instinct
or
unthinking
nature
of
a
hot
day
a
dog
will
often
dig
down
to
fresh
earth
to
get
cooler
soil
to
lie
on
or
he
will
go
and
lie
in
the
creek
all
dogs
do
these
things
now
if
the
dog
were
seen
to
carry
stones
and
sods
to
dam
up
the
creek
to
make
a
deeper
pool
to
lie
in
then
he
would
in
a
measure
be
imitating
the
beavers
and
this
in
the
dog
could
fairly
be
called
an
act
of
reason
because
it
is
not
a
necessity
of
the
conditions
of
his
life
it
would
be
of
the
nature
of
an
afterthought
all
animals
of
a
given
species
are
wise
in
their
own
way
but
not
in
the
way
of
another
species
the
robin
could
not
build
the
nest
nor
the
oriole
build
the
robin
nor
the
swallow
the
cunning
of
the
fox
is
not
the
cunning
of
the
coon
the
squirrel
knows
a
good
deal
more
about
nuts
than
the
rabbit
does
but
the
rabbit
would
live
where
the
squirrel
would
die
the
muskrat
and
the
beaver
build
lodges
much
alike
that
is
with
the
entrance
under
water
and
an
inner
chamber
above
the
water
and
this
because
they
are
both
with
necessities
much
the
same
now
the
mark
of
reason
is
that
it
is
endlessly
adaptive
that
it
can
apply
itself
to
all
kinds
of
problems
that
it
can
adapt
old
means
to
new
ends
or
new
means
to
old
ends
and
is
capable
of
progressive
development
it
holds
what
it
gets
and
uses
that
as
a
fulcrum
to
get
more
but
this
is
not
at
all
the
way
of
animal
instinct
which
begins
and
ends
as
instinct
and
is
a
large
part
of
our
own
lives
is
instinctive
and
void
of
thought
we
go
instinctively
toward
the
warmth
and
away
from
the
cold
all
our
affections
are
instinctive
and
do
not
wait
upon
the
reason
our
affinities
are
as
independent
of
our
reflection
as
gravity
is
our
inherited
traits
the
ties
of
race
the
spirit
of
the
times
in
which
we
live
the
impressions
of
youth
of
climate
of
soil
of
our
surroundings
all
influence
our
acts
and
often
determine
them
without
any
conscious
exercise
of
judgment
or
reason
on
our
part
then
habit
is
with
us
temperament
is
potent
health
and
disease
are
potent
indeed
the
amount
of
conscious
reason
that
an
ordinary
man
uses
in
his
life
compared
with
the
great
unreason
or
blind
impulse
and
inborn
tendency
that
impel
him
is
like
his
artificial
lights
compared
with
the
light
of
day
indispensable
on
special
occasions
but
a
feeble
matter
after
all
reason
is
an
artificial
light
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
one
with
the
light
of
nature
and
in
the
sense
that
men
possess
it
in
varying
degrees
the
lower
animals
have
only
a
gleam
of
it
now
and
then
they
are
wise
as
the
plants
and
trees
are
wise
and
are
guided
by
their
inborn
tendencies
is
instinct
resourceful
can
it
meet
new
conditions
can
it
solve
a
new
problem
if
so
how
does
it
differ
from
free
intelligence
or
judgment
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
up
to
a
certain
point
instinct
is
resourceful
thus
a
western
correspondent
writes
at
three
different
times
i
have
pursued
the
common
from
a
level
field
when
the
rabbit
coming
to
a
furrow
that
ran
at
right
angles
to
his
course
jumped
into
it
and
crouching
down
slowly
crept
away
to
the
end
of
the
furrow
when
it
jumped
out
and
ran
at
full
speed
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
resourcefulness
of
instinct
the
instinct
to
escape
from
an
enemy
an
old
problem
met
by
taking
advantage
of
an
unusual
opportunity
to
run
to
double
to
crouch
to
hide
are
probably
all
reflex
acts
with
certain
animals
when
hunted
the
bird
when
pursued
by
a
hawk
rushes
to
cover
in
a
tree
or
a
bush
or
beneath
some
object
last
summer
i
saw
a
bald
eagle
pursuing
a
fish
hawk
that
held
a
fish
in
its
talons
the
hawk
had
a
long
start
of
the
eagle
and
began
mounting
upward
screaming
in
protest
or
defiance
as
it
mounted
the
pirate
circled
far
beneath
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
seeing
how
he
was
distanced
turned
back
toward
the
ocean
so
that
i
did
not
witness
the
little
drama
in
the
air
that
i
had
so
long
wished
to
see
a
wounded
wild
duck
suddenly
develops
much
cunning
in
escaping
from
the
gunner
swimming
under
water
hiding
by
the
shore
with
only
the
end
of
the
bill
in
the
air
or
diving
and
seizing
upon
some
object
at
the
bottom
where
it
sometimes
remains
till
life
is
extinct
i
once
saw
some
try
to
capture
a
fatted
calf
that
had
run
all
summer
in
a
partly
wooded
field
till
it
had
become
rather
wild
as
the
calf
refused
to
be
cornered
the
farmer
shot
it
with
his
rifle
but
only
inflicted
a
severe
wound
in
the
head
the
calf
then
became
as
wild
as
a
deer
and
scaled
fences
in
much
the
manner
of
the
deer
when
cornered
it
turned
and
broke
through
the
line
in
sheer
desperation
and
showed
wonderful
resources
in
eluding
its
pursuers
it
coursed
over
the
hills
and
gained
the
mountain
where
it
baffled
its
pursuers
for
two
days
before
it
was
run
down
and
caught
all
such
cases
show
the
resources
of
instinct
the
instinct
of
fear
the
skill
of
a
bird
in
hiding
its
nest
is
very
great
as
is
the
cunning
displayed
in
keeping
the
secret
afterward
how
careful
it
is
not
to
betray
the
precious
locality
to
the
supposed
enemy
even
the
domestic
turkey
when
she
hides
her
nest
in
the
bush
if
watched
approaches
it
by
all
manner
of
delays
and
indirections
and
when
she
leaves
it
to
feed
usually
does
so
on
the
wing
i
look
upon
these
and
kindred
acts
as
exhibiting
only
the
resourcefulness
of
instinct
we
are
not
to
forget
that
the
resourcefulness
and
flexibility
of
instinct
which
all
animals
show
some
more
and
some
less
is
not
reason
though
it
is
doubtless
the
first
step
toward
it
out
of
it
the
conscious
reason
and
intelligence
of
man
probably
have
been
evolved
i
do
not
object
to
hearing
this
variability
and
plasticity
of
instinct
called
the
twilight
of
mind
or
rudimentary
mentality
it
is
that
or
something
like
that
what
i
object
to
is
hearing
those
things
in
animal
life
ascribed
to
reason
that
can
be
easier
accounted
for
on
the
theory
of
instinct
i
must
differ
from
the
ornithologist
of
the
new
york
zoölogical
park
when
he
says
in
a
recent
paper
that
a
bird
affection
for
her
young
is
not
an
instinct
an
uncontrollable
emotion
but
i
quite
agree
with
him
that
it
does
not
differ
in
kind
at
least
from
the
emotion
of
the
human
mother
in
both
cases
the
affection
is
instinctive
and
not
a
matter
of
reason
or
forethought
or
afterthought
at
all
the
two
affections
differ
in
this
that
one
is
brief
and
transient
and
the
other
is
deep
and
lasting
under
stress
of
circumstances
the
bird
will
abandon
her
helpless
young
while
the
human
mother
will
not
when
the
food
supply
fails
the
lower
animal
will
not
share
the
last
morsel
with
its
young
its
fierce
hunger
makes
it
forget
them
during
the
cold
wet
summer
of
a
vast
number
of
birds
orioles
finches
warblers
perished
in
the
nest
probably
from
scarcity
of
insect
food
and
the
neglect
of
the
mothers
to
hover
them
in
interpreting
the
action
of
the
animals
we
so
often
do
the
thinking
and
reasoning
ourselves
which
we
attribute
to
them
thus
beebe
in
the
paper
referred
to
says
birds
have
early
learned
to
take
clams
or
mussels
in
their
beaks
or
claws
at
low
tide
and
carry
them
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
so
that
at
the
death
of
the
mollusk
the
relaxation
of
the
adductor
muscle
would
permit
the
shell
to
spring
open
and
afford
easy
access
to
the
inmate
no
doubt
the
advancing
tide
would
cause
the
bird
to
carry
the
back
out
of
the
reach
of
the
waves
where
it
might
hope
to
get
at
its
meat
but
where
it
would
be
compelled
to
leave
the
shell
unopened
but
that
the
bird
knew
the
fish
would
die
there
and
that
its
shell
would
then
open
it
is
in
such
particulars
that
the
observer
does
the
thinking
two
other
writers
upon
our
birds
have
stated
that
pelicans
will
gather
in
flocks
along
the
shore
and
by
manoeuvring
and
beating
the
water
with
their
wings
will
drive
the
fish
into
the
shallows
where
they
easily
capture
them
here
again
the
observer
thinks
for
the
observed
the
pelicans
see
the
fish
and
pursue
them
without
any
plan
to
corner
them
in
shoal
water
but
the
inevitable
result
is
that
they
are
so
cornered
and
captured
the
fish
are
foolish
but
the
pelicans
are
not
wise
the
wisdom
here
attributed
to
them
is
human
wisdom
and
not
animal
wisdom
to
observe
the
actions
of
the
lower
animals
without
reading
our
own
thoughts
into
them
is
not
an
easy
matter
beebe
thinks
that
when
in
early
spring
the
peacock
in
the
zoölogical
park
timidly
erects
its
plumes
before
an
unappreciative
crow
it
is
merely
practicing
the
art
of
showing
off
its
gay
plumes
in
anticipation
of
the
time
when
it
shall
compete
with
its
rivals
before
the
females
in
other
words
that
it
is
rehearsing
its
part
but
i
should
say
that
the
peacock
struts
before
the
crow
or
before
spectators
because
it
ca
help
it
the
sexual
instinct
begins
to
flame
up
and
master
it
the
fowl
can
no
more
control
it
than
it
can
control
its
appetite
for
food
to
practice
beforehand
is
human
animal
practice
takes
the
form
of
spontaneous
play
the
mock
battles
of
two
dogs
or
of
other
animals
are
not
conscious
practice
on
their
part
but
are
play
pure
and
simple
the
same
as
human
games
though
their
value
as
training
is
obvious
enough
animals
do
not
have
general
ideas
they
receive
impressions
through
their
various
senses
to
which
they
respond
i
recently
read
in
manuscript
a
very
clear
and
concise
paper
on
the
subject
of
animal
thinking
compared
with
that
of
man
in
which
the
writer
says
there
is
a
rudimentary
abstraction
before
language
all
the
higher
animals
have
general
ideas
of
and
quite
apart
from
any
particular
objects
of
which
either
of
these
qualities
happens
to
be
characteristic
it
is
at
this
point
i
think
that
the
writer
referred
to
goes
wrong
the
animal
has
no
idea
at
all
about
what
is
good
to
eat
and
what
is
not
good
it
is
guided
entirely
by
its
senses
it
reacts
to
the
stimuli
that
reach
it
through
the
sight
or
smell
usually
the
latter
there
is
no
mental
process
at
all
in
the
matter
not
the
most
rudimentary
there
is
simple
reaction
to
stimuli
as
strictly
so
as
when
we
sneeze
on
taking
snuff
man
alone
has
ideas
of
what
is
good
to
eat
and
what
is
not
good
when
a
fox
prowls
about
a
farmhouse
he
has
no
general
idea
that
there
are
eatable
things
there
as
the
essayist
above
referred
to
alleges
he
is
simply
following
his
nose
he
smells
something
to
which
he
responds
we
think
for
him
when
we
attribute
to
him
general
ideas
of
what
he
is
likely
to
find
at
the
farmhouse
but
when
a
man
goes
to
a
restaurant
he
follows
an
idea
and
not
his
nose
he
compares
the
different
viands
in
his
mind
and
often
decides
beforehand
what
he
will
have
there
is
no
agreement
in
the
two
cases
at
all
if
when
the
bird
chooses
the
site
for
its
nest
or
the
chipmunk
or
the
woodchuck
the
place
for
its
hole
or
the
beaver
the
spot
for
its
dam
we
make
these
animals
think
compare
weigh
we
are
simply
putting
ourselves
in
their
place
and
making
them
do
as
we
would
do
under
like
conditions
animal
life
parallels
human
life
at
many
points
but
it
is
in
another
plane
something
guides
the
lower
animals
but
it
is
not
thought
something
restrains
them
but
it
is
not
judgment
they
are
provident
without
prudence
they
are
active
without
industry
they
are
skillful
without
practice
they
are
wise
without
knowledge
they
are
rational
without
reason
they
are
deceptive
without
guile
they
cross
seas
without
a
compass
they
return
home
without
guidance
they
communicate
without
language
their
flocks
act
as
a
unit
without
signals
or
leaders
when
they
are
joyful
they
sing
or
they
play
when
they
are
distressed
they
moan
or
they
cry
when
they
are
jealous
they
bite
or
they
claw
or
they
strike
or
they
gore
and
yet
i
do
not
suppose
they
experience
the
emotions
of
joy
or
sorrow
or
anger
or
love
as
we
do
because
these
feelings
in
them
do
not
involve
reflection
memory
and
what
we
call
the
higher
nature
as
with
us
the
animals
do
not
have
to
consult
the
almanac
to
know
when
to
migrate
or
to
go
into
winter
quarters
at
a
certain
time
in
the
fall
i
see
the
newts
all
making
for
the
marshes
at
a
certain
time
in
the
spring
i
see
them
all
returning
to
the
woods
again
at
one
place
where
i
walk
i
see
them
on
the
railroad
track
wandering
up
and
down
between
the
rails
trying
to
get
across
i
often
lend
them
a
hand
they
know
when
and
in
what
direction
to
go
but
not
in
the
way
i
should
know
under
the
same
circumstances
i
should
have
to
learn
or
be
told
they
know
instinctively
we
marvel
at
what
we
call
the
wisdom
of
nature
but
how
unlike
our
own
how
blind
and
yet
in
the
end
how
sure
how
wasteful
and
yet
how
conserving
how
she
sows
her
seed
yet
behold
the
forest
or
the
flowery
plain
her
springs
leap
out
everywhere
yet
how
inevitably
their
waters
find
their
way
into
streams
the
streams
into
rivers
and
the
rivers
to
the
sea
nature
is
an
engineer
without
science
and
a
builder
without
rules
the
animals
follow
the
tides
and
the
seasons
they
find
their
own
the
fittest
and
the
luckiest
survive
the
struggle
for
life
is
sharp
with
them
all
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
the
young
cowbirds
reared
by
many
different
all
gather
in
flocks
in
the
fall
they
know
their
kind
at
least
they
are
attracted
by
their
kind
a
correspondent
asks
me
if
i
do
not
think
the
minds
of
animals
capable
of
improvement
not
in
the
strict
sense
when
we
teach
an
animal
anything
we
make
an
impression
upon
its
senses
and
repeat
this
impression
over
and
over
till
we
establish
a
habit
we
do
not
bring
about
any
mental
development
as
we
do
in
the
child
we
mould
and
stamp
its
sense
memory
it
is
like
bending
or
compressing
a
vegetable
growth
till
it
takes
a
certain
form
the
human
animal
sees
through
the
trick
he
comprehends
it
and
does
not
need
the
endless
repetition
when
repetition
has
worn
a
path
in
our
minds
then
we
too
act
automatically
or
without
conscious
thought
as
we
do
for
instance
in
forming
the
letters
when
we
write
wild
animals
are
trained
but
not
educated
we
multiply
impressions
upon
them
without
adding
to
their
store
of
knowledge
because
they
can
not
evolve
general
ideas
from
these
sense
impressions
here
we
reach
their
limitations
a
bluebird
or
a
robin
will
fight
its
reflected
image
in
the
of
a
darkened
room
day
after
day
and
never
master
the
delusion
it
can
take
no
step
beyond
the
evidence
of
its
senses
a
hard
step
even
for
man
to
take
you
may
train
your
dog
so
that
he
will
bound
around
you
when
he
greets
you
without
putting
his
feet
upon
you
but
do
you
suppose
the
fond
creature
ever
comes
to
know
why
you
do
not
want
his
feet
upon
you
if
he
does
then
he
takes
the
step
in
general
knowledge
to
which
i
have
referred
your
cow
tethered
by
a
long
rope
upon
the
lawn
learns
many
things
about
that
rope
and
how
to
manage
it
that
she
did
not
know
when
she
was
first
tied
but
she
can
never
know
why
she
is
tethered
or
why
she
is
not
to
crop
the
shrubbery
or
paw
up
the
turf
or
reach
the
corn
on
the
edge
of
the
garden
this
would
imply
general
ideas
or
power
of
reflection
you
might
punish
her
until
she
was
afraid
to
do
any
of
these
things
but
you
could
never
enlighten
her
on
the
subject
the
rudest
savage
can
in
a
measure
be
enlightened
he
can
be
taught
the
reason
why
of
things
but
an
animal
can
not
we
can
make
its
impulses
follow
a
rut
so
to
speak
but
we
can
not
make
them
free
and
animals
are
the
victims
of
habits
inherited
or
acquired
i
was
told
of
a
fox
that
came
nightly
prowling
about
some
deadfalls
set
for
other
game
the
snow
each
night
showed
the
movements
of
the
suspicious
animal
it
dared
not
approach
nearer
than
several
feet
to
the
deadfalls
then
one
day
a
hawk
seized
the
bait
in
one
of
the
traps
and
was
caught
that
night
a
fox
presumably
the
same
one
came
and
ate
such
parts
of
the
body
of
the
hawk
as
protruded
from
beneath
the
stone
now
how
did
the
fox
know
that
the
trap
was
sprung
and
was
now
harmless
did
not
its
act
imply
something
more
than
instinct
we
have
the
cunning
and
suspicion
of
the
fox
to
start
with
these
are
factors
already
in
the
problem
that
do
not
have
to
be
accounted
for
to
the
fox
as
to
the
crow
anything
that
looks
like
design
or
a
trap
anything
that
does
not
match
with
the
haphazard
look
and
general
disarray
of
objects
in
nature
will
put
it
on
its
guard
a
deadfall
is
a
contrivance
that
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
usual
fortuitous
disarray
of
sticks
and
stones
in
the
fields
and
woods
the
odor
of
the
man
hand
would
also
be
there
and
this
of
itself
would
put
the
fox
on
its
guard
but
a
hawk
or
any
other
animal
crushed
by
a
stone
with
part
of
its
body
protruding
from
beneath
the
stone
has
quite
a
different
air
it
at
least
does
not
look
threatening
the
rock
is
not
impending
the
open
jaws
are
closed
more
than
that
the
smell
of
the
man
hand
would
be
less
apparent
if
not
entirely
absent
the
fox
drew
no
rational
conclusions
its
instinctive
fear
was
allayed
by
the
changed
conditions
of
the
trap
the
hawk
has
not
the
fox
cunning
hence
it
fell
an
easy
victim
i
do
not
think
that
the
cunning
of
the
fox
is
any
more
akin
to
reason
than
is
the
power
of
smell
of
the
hound
that
pursues
him
both
are
inborn
and
are
quite
independent
of
experience
if
a
fox
were
deliberately
to
seek
to
elude
the
hound
by
running
through
a
flock
of
sheep
or
by
following
the
bed
of
a
shallow
stream
or
by
taking
to
the
public
highway
then
i
think
we
should
have
to
credit
him
with
powers
of
reflection
it
is
true
he
often
does
all
these
things
but
whether
he
does
them
by
chance
or
of
set
purpose
admits
of
doubt
the
cunning
of
a
fox
is
as
much
a
part
of
his
inherited
nature
as
is
his
fleetness
of
foot
all
the
more
notable
animals
as
the
fox
the
beaver
the
otter
have
doubtless
been
persecuted
by
man
and
his
savage
ancestors
for
tens
of
thousands
of
years
and
their
suspicion
of
traps
and
lures
and
their
skill
in
eluding
them
are
the
accumulated
inheritance
of
ages
in
denying
what
we
mean
by
thought
or
free
intelligence
to
animals
an
exception
should
undoubtedly
be
made
in
favor
of
the
dog
i
have
else
where
said
that
the
dog
is
almost
a
human
product
he
has
been
the
companion
of
man
so
long
and
has
been
so
loved
by
him
that
he
has
come
to
partake
in
a
measure
at
least
of
his
master
nature
if
the
dog
does
not
at
times
think
reflect
he
does
something
so
like
it
that
i
can
find
no
other
name
for
it
take
so
simple
an
incident
as
this
which
is
of
common
occurrence
a
collie
dog
is
going
along
the
street
in
advance
of
its
master
team
it
comes
to
a
point
where
the
road
forks
the
dog
takes
say
the
road
to
the
left
and
trots
along
it
a
few
rods
and
then
half
turning
suddenly
pauses
and
looks
back
at
the
team
has
he
not
been
struck
by
the
thought
i
do
not
know
which
way
my
master
is
going
i
will
wait
and
see
if
the
dog
in
such
cases
does
not
reflect
what
does
he
do
can
we
find
any
other
word
for
his
act
to
ask
a
question
by
word
or
deed
involves
some
sort
of
a
mental
process
however
rudimentary
is
there
any
other
animal
that
would
act
as
the
collie
did
under
like
circumstances
a
western
physician
writes
me
that
he
has
on
three
different
occasions
seen
his
pointer
dog
behave
as
follows
he
had
pointed
a
flock
of
quail
that
would
not
sit
to
be
flushed
but
kept
running
then
the
dog
without
a
word
or
sign
from
his
master
made
a
long
détour
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
around
the
retreating
birds
headed
them
off
and
then
slowly
advanced
facing
the
gunner
till
he
came
to
a
point
again
with
the
quail
in
a
position
to
be
flushed
after
crediting
the
instinct
and
the
training
of
the
dog
to
the
full
such
an
act
i
think
shows
a
degree
of
independent
judgment
the
dog
had
not
been
trained
to
do
that
particular
thing
and
took
the
initiative
of
his
own
accord
many
authentic
stories
are
told
of
cats
which
seem
to
show
that
they
too
have
profited
in
the
way
of
added
intelligence
by
their
long
intercourse
with
man
a
lady
writing
to
me
from
new
york
makes
the
following
discriminating
remarks
upon
the
cat
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
which
you
ascribe
for
the
of
the
dog
his
long
intercourse
with
man
might
apply
in
some
degree
to
the
cat
but
it
is
necessary
to
be
very
fond
of
cats
in
order
to
perceive
their
qualities
the
dog
is
in
every
face
so
to
speak
always
in
evidence
always
on
deck
but
the
cat
is
a
shy
reserved
exclusive
creature
the
dog
is
the
humble
friend
follower
imitator
and
slave
of
man
he
will
lick
the
foot
that
kicks
him
the
cat
instead
will
scratch
the
dog
begs
for
notice
the
cat
must
be
loved
much
and
courted
assiduously
before
she
will
blossom
out
and
humanize
under
the
atmosphere
of
affection
the
dog
seems
to
me
to
have
the
typical
qualities
of
the
negro
the
cat
of
the
indian
she
is
indifferent
to
man
cares
nothing
for
him
unless
he
wins
her
by
special
and
consistent
kindness
and
throughout
her
long
domestication
has
kept
her
wild
independence
and
ability
to
forage
for
herself
when
turned
loose
whether
in
forest
or
city
street
it
is
when
she
is
much
loved
and
petted
that
her
intelligence
manifests
itself
in
such
quiet
ways
that
an
indifferent
observer
will
never
notice
them
but
she
always
knows
who
is
fond
of
her
and
which
member
of
the
family
is
fondest
of
her
the
correspondent
who
had
the
experience
with
his
pointer
dog
relates
this
incident
about
his
blooded
mare
a
drove
of
horses
were
pasturing
in
a
lot
the
horses
had
paired
off
as
horses
usually
do
under
such
circumstances
the
doctor
thoroughbred
mare
had
paired
with
another
mare
that
was
totally
blind
and
had
been
so
since
a
colt
through
the
field
ran
a
little
creek
which
could
not
well
be
crossed
by
the
horses
except
at
a
bridge
at
one
end
one
day
when
the
farmer
went
to
salt
the
animals
they
all
came
galloping
over
the
bridge
and
up
to
the
gate
except
the
blind
one
she
could
not
find
the
bridge
and
remained
on
the
other
side
whinnying
and
stamping
while
the
others
were
getting
their
salt
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
presently
the
blooded
mare
suddenly
left
her
salt
made
her
way
through
the
herd
and
went
at
a
flying
gallop
down
across
the
bridge
to
the
blind
animal
then
she
turned
and
came
back
followed
by
the
blind
one
the
doctor
is
convinced
that
his
mare
deliberately
went
back
to
conduct
her
blind
companion
over
the
bridge
and
down
to
the
but
the
act
may
be
more
simply
explained
how
could
the
mare
have
known
her
companion
was
blind
what
could
any
horse
know
about
such
a
disability
the
only
thing
implied
in
the
incident
is
the
attachment
of
one
animal
for
another
the
mare
heard
her
mate
calling
probably
in
tones
of
excitement
or
distress
and
she
flew
back
to
her
finding
her
all
right
she
turned
toward
the
salt
again
and
was
followed
by
her
fellow
instinct
did
it
all
my
own
observation
of
the
wild
creatures
has
revealed
nothing
so
near
to
human
thought
and
reflection
as
is
seen
in
the
cases
of
the
collie
and
pointer
dogs
above
referred
to
the
nearest
to
them
of
anything
i
can
now
recall
is
an
incident
related
by
an
english
writer
kearton
in
one
of
his
books
kearton
relates
how
he
has
frequently
fooled
sitting
birds
with
wooden
eggs
he
put
his
counterfeits
painted
and
marked
like
the
originals
into
the
nests
of
the
song
thrush
the
blackbird
and
the
grasshopper
warbler
and
in
no
case
was
the
imposition
detected
in
the
warbler
nest
he
placed
dummy
eggs
twice
the
size
of
her
own
and
the
bird
proceeded
to
brood
them
without
the
slightest
sign
of
suspicion
that
they
were
not
of
her
own
laying
but
when
kearton
tried
his
counterfeits
upon
a
ring
plover
the
fraud
was
detected
the
plover
hammered
the
shams
with
her
bill
in
the
most
skeptical
fashion
and
refused
to
sit
down
upon
them
when
two
of
the
bird
own
eggs
were
returned
to
the
nest
and
left
there
with
two
wooden
ones
the
plover
tried
to
throw
out
the
shams
but
failing
to
do
this
reluctantly
sat
down
and
covered
good
and
bad
alike
now
can
the
action
of
the
plover
in
this
case
be
explained
on
the
theory
of
instinct
alone
the
bird
could
hardly
have
had
such
an
experience
before
it
was
offered
a
counterfeit
and
it
behaved
much
as
you
or
i
would
have
done
under
like
conditions
although
we
have
the
general
idea
of
counterfeits
which
the
plover
could
not
have
had
of
course
everything
that
pertains
to
the
nest
and
eggs
of
a
bird
is
very
vital
to
it
the
bird
is
wise
about
these
things
from
instinct
yet
the
other
birds
were
easily
fooled
we
do
not
know
how
nearly
perfect
kearton
imitation
eggs
were
but
evidently
there
was
some
defect
in
them
which
arrested
the
bird
attention
if
the
incident
does
not
show
powers
of
reflection
in
the
bird
it
certainly
shows
keen
powers
of
perception
and
that
birds
and
indeed
all
animals
show
varying
degrees
of
this
power
is
a
matter
of
common
observation
i
hesitate
therefore
to
say
that
kearton
plover
showed
anything
more
than
very
keen
instincts
among
our
own
birds
there
is
only
one
so
far
as
i
know
that
detects
the
egg
of
the
cowbird
when
it
is
laid
in
the
bird
nest
and
that
is
the
yellow
warbler
all
the
other
birds
accept
it
as
their
own
but
this
warbler
detects
the
imposition
and
proceeds
to
get
rid
of
the
strange
egg
by
burying
it
under
a
new
nest
bottom
man
is
undoubtedly
of
animal
origin
the
road
by
which
he
has
come
out
of
the
dim
past
lies
through
the
lower
animals
the
germ
and
potentiality
of
all
that
he
has
become
or
can
become
was
sleeping
there
in
his
humble
origins
of
this
i
have
no
doubt
yet
i
think
we
are
justified
in
saying
that
the
difference
between
animal
intelligence
and
human
reason
is
one
of
kind
and
not
merely
of
degree
flying
and
walking
are
both
modes
of
locomotion
and
yet
may
we
not
fairly
say
they
differ
in
kind
reason
and
instinct
are
both
manifestations
of
intelligence
yet
do
they
not
belong
to
different
planes
intensify
animal
instinct
ever
so
much
and
you
have
not
reached
the
plane
of
reason
the
homing
instinct
of
certain
animals
is
far
beyond
any
gift
of
the
kind
possessed
by
man
and
yet
it
seems
in
no
way
akin
to
reason
reason
heeds
the
points
of
the
compass
and
takes
note
of
the
topography
of
the
country
but
what
can
animals
know
of
these
things
and
yet
i
say
the
animal
is
father
of
the
man
without
the
lower
orders
there
could
have
been
no
higher
in
my
opinion
no
miracle
or
special
creation
is
required
to
account
for
man
the
transformation
of
force
as
of
heat
into
light
or
electricity
is
as
great
a
leap
and
as
mysterious
as
the
transformation
of
animal
intelligence
into
human
reason
xiii
reading
the
book
of
nature
in
studying
nature
the
important
thing
is
not
so
much
what
we
see
as
how
we
interpret
what
we
see
do
we
get
at
the
true
meaning
of
the
facts
do
we
draw
the
right
inference
the
fossils
in
the
rocks
were
long
observed
before
men
drew
the
right
inference
from
them
so
with
a
hundred
other
things
in
nature
and
life
during
may
and
a
part
of
june
of
a
drouth
of
unusual
severity
prevailed
throughout
the
land
the
pools
and
marshes
nearly
all
dried
up
late
in
june
the
rains
came
again
and
filled
them
up
then
an
unusual
thing
happened
suddenly
for
two
or
three
days
and
nights
the
marshes
about
me
were
again
vocal
with
the
many
voices
of
the
hyla
the
peepers
of
early
spring
that
is
the
fact
now
what
is
the
interpretation
with
me
the
peepers
become
silent
in
early
may
and
i
suppose
leave
the
marshes
for
their
life
in
the
woods
did
the
drouth
destroy
all
their
eggs
and
young
and
did
they
know
this
and
so
come
back
to
try
again
how
else
shall
one
explain
their
second
appearance
in
the
marshes
but
how
did
they
know
of
the
destruction
of
their
young
and
how
can
we
account
for
their
concerted
action
these
are
difficulties
not
easily
overcome
a
more
rational
explanation
to
me
is
this
namely
that
the
extreme
dryness
of
the
woods
nearly
two
months
without
rain
drove
the
little
frogs
to
seek
for
moisture
in
their
spring
haunts
where
in
places
a
little
water
would
be
pretty
certain
to
be
found
here
they
were
holding
out
probably
hibernating
again
as
such
creatures
do
in
the
tropics
during
the
dry
season
when
the
rains
came
and
here
again
they
sent
up
their
spring
chorus
of
voices
and
for
aught
i
know
once
more
deposited
their
eggs
this
to
me
is
much
more
like
the
ways
of
nature
with
her
creatures
than
is
the
theory
of
the
frogs
voluntary
return
to
the
swamps
and
pools
to
start
the
season
over
again
the
birds
at
least
show
little
or
no
wit
when
a
new
problem
is
presented
to
them
they
have
no
power
of
initiative
instinct
runs
in
a
groove
and
can
not
take
a
step
outside
of
it
one
may
day
we
started
a
meadowlark
from
her
nest
there
were
three
just
hatched
young
in
the
nest
and
one
egg
lying
on
the
ground
about
two
inches
from
the
nest
i
suspected
that
this
egg
was
infertile
and
that
the
bird
had
had
the
sense
to
throw
it
out
but
on
examination
it
was
found
to
contain
a
nearly
grown
bird
the
inference
was
then
that
the
egg
had
been
accidentally
carried
out
of
the
nest
some
time
when
the
sitting
bird
had
taken
a
sudden
flight
and
that
she
did
not
have
the
sense
to
roll
or
carry
it
back
to
its
place
there
is
another
view
of
the
case
which
no
doubt
the
sentimental
school
of
nature
study
would
eagerly
adopt
a
very
severe
drouth
reigned
throughout
the
land
food
was
probably
scarce
and
was
becoming
scarcer
the
bird
foresaw
her
inability
to
care
for
four
young
ones
and
so
reduced
the
possible
number
by
ejecting
one
of
the
eggs
from
the
nest
this
sounds
pretty
and
plausible
and
so
credits
the
bird
with
the
wisdom
that
the
public
is
so
fond
of
believing
it
possesses
something
like
this
wisdom
often
occurs
among
the
hive
bees
in
seasons
of
scarcity
they
will
destroy
the
unhatched
queens
but
birds
have
no
such
foresight
and
make
no
such
calculations
in
cold
backward
seasons
i
think
birds
lay
fewer
eggs
than
when
the
season
is
early
and
warm
but
that
is
not
a
matter
of
calculation
on
their
part
it
is
the
result
of
outward
conditions
a
great
many
observers
and
nature
students
at
the
present
time
are
possessed
of
the
notion
that
the
birds
and
beasts
instruct
their
young
train
them
and
tutor
them
much
after
the
human
manner
in
the
familiar
sight
of
a
pair
of
crows
foraging
with
their
young
about
a
field
in
summer
one
of
our
nature
writers
sees
the
old
birds
giving
their
young
a
lesson
in
flying
she
says
that
the
most
important
thing
that
the
elders
had
to
do
was
to
teach
the
youngsters
how
to
fly
this
they
did
by
circling
about
the
pasture
giving
a
peculiar
call
while
they
were
followed
by
their
flock
all
but
one
this
was
a
bobtailed
crow
and
he
did
not
obey
the
word
of
command
his
mother
took
note
of
his
disobedience
and
proceeded
to
discipline
him
he
stood
upon
a
big
stone
and
she
came
down
upon
him
and
knocked
him
off
his
perch
he
squawked
and
fluttered
his
wings
to
keep
from
falling
but
the
blow
came
so
suddenly
that
he
had
not
time
to
save
himself
and
he
fell
flat
on
the
ground
in
a
minute
he
clambered
back
upon
his
stone
and
i
watched
him
closely
the
next
time
the
call
came
to
fly
he
did
not
linger
but
went
with
the
rest
and
so
long
as
i
could
watch
him
he
never
disobeyed
again
i
should
interpret
this
fact
of
the
old
and
young
crows
flying
about
a
field
in
summer
quite
differently
the
young
are
fully
fledged
and
are
already
strong
flyers
when
this
occurs
they
do
not
leave
the
nest
until
they
can
fly
well
and
need
no
tutoring
what
the
writer
really
saw
was
what
any
one
may
see
on
the
farm
in
june
and
july
she
saw
the
parent
crows
foraging
with
their
young
in
a
field
the
old
birds
flew
about
followed
by
their
brood
clamorous
for
the
food
which
their
parents
found
the
bobtailed
bird
which
had
probably
met
with
some
accident
did
not
follow
and
the
mother
returned
to
feed
it
the
young
crow
lifted
its
wings
and
flapped
them
and
in
its
eagerness
probably
fell
off
its
perch
then
when
its
parent
flew
away
it
followed
i
think
it
highly
probable
that
the
sense
or
faculty
by
which
animals
find
their
way
home
over
long
stretches
of
country
and
which
keeps
them
from
ever
being
lost
as
man
so
often
is
is
a
faculty
entirely
unlike
anything
man
now
possesses
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
faculty
that
guides
the
birds
back
a
thousand
miles
or
more
to
their
old
in
caged
or
housed
animals
i
fancy
this
faculty
soon
becomes
blunted
president
roosevelt
tells
in
his
ranch
life
of
a
horse
he
owned
that
ran
away
two
hundred
miles
across
the
plains
swimming
rivers
on
the
way
to
its
old
home
it
is
very
certain
i
think
that
this
homing
feat
is
not
accomplished
by
the
aid
of
either
sight
or
scent
for
usually
the
returning
animal
seems
to
follow
a
comparatively
straight
line
it
is
or
seems
to
be
a
consciousness
of
direction
that
is
as
unerring
as
the
magnetic
needle
reason
calculation
and
judgment
err
but
these
primary
instincts
of
the
animal
seem
almost
infallible
in
bronx
park
in
new
york
a
grebe
and
a
loon
lived
together
in
an
inclosure
in
which
was
a
large
pool
of
water
the
two
birds
became
much
attached
to
each
other
and
were
never
long
separated
one
winter
day
on
which
the
pool
was
frozen
over
except
a
small
opening
in
one
end
of
it
the
grebe
dived
under
the
ice
and
made
its
way
to
the
far
end
of
the
pool
where
it
remained
swimming
about
aimlessly
for
some
moments
presently
the
loon
missed
its
companion
and
with
an
apparent
look
of
concern
dived
under
the
ice
and
joined
it
at
the
closed
end
of
the
pool
the
grebe
seemed
to
be
in
distress
for
want
of
air
then
the
loon
settled
upon
the
bottom
and
with
lifted
beak
sprang
up
with
much
force
against
the
ice
piercing
it
with
its
bill
but
not
breaking
it
down
to
the
bottom
it
went
again
and
again
hurled
itself
up
against
the
ice
this
time
shattering
it
and
rising
to
the
surface
where
the
grebe
was
quick
to
follow
now
it
looked
as
if
the
loon
had
gone
under
the
ice
to
rescue
its
friend
from
a
dangerous
situation
for
had
not
the
grebe
soon
found
the
air
it
must
have
perished
and
persons
who
witnessed
the
incident
interpreted
it
in
this
way
it
is
in
such
cases
that
we
are
so
apt
to
read
our
human
motives
and
emotions
into
the
acts
of
the
lower
animals
i
do
not
suppose
the
loon
realized
the
danger
of
its
companion
nor
went
under
the
ice
to
rescue
it
it
followed
the
grebe
because
it
wanted
to
be
with
it
or
to
share
in
any
food
that
might
be
detaining
it
there
and
then
finding
no
it
proceeded
to
make
one
as
it
and
its
ancestors
must
often
have
done
before
all
our
northern
divers
must
be
more
or
less
acquainted
with
ice
and
must
know
how
to
break
it
the
grebe
itself
could
doubtless
have
broken
the
ice
had
it
desired
to
the
birds
and
the
beasts
often
show
much
intelligence
or
what
looks
like
intelligence
but
as
hamerton
says
the
moment
we
think
of
them
as
we
are
lost
a
farmer
had
a
yearling
that
sucked
the
cows
to
prevent
this
he
put
on
the
yearling
a
muzzle
set
full
of
sharpened
nails
these
of
course
pricked
the
cows
and
they
would
not
stand
to
be
drained
of
their
milk
the
next
day
the
farmer
saw
the
yearling
rubbing
the
nails
against
a
rock
in
order
as
he
thought
to
dull
them
so
they
would
not
prick
the
cows
how
much
easier
to
believe
that
the
beast
was
simply
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
awkward
incumbrance
upon
its
nose
what
can
a
calf
or
a
cow
know
about
sharpened
nails
and
the
use
of
a
rock
to
dull
them
this
is
a
kind
of
outside
knowledge
outside
of
their
needs
and
experiences
that
they
could
not
possess
an
arizona
friend
of
mine
lately
told
me
this
interesting
incident
about
the
gophers
that
infested
his
cabin
when
he
was
a
miner
the
gophers
ate
up
his
bread
he
could
not
hide
it
from
them
or
put
it
beyond
their
reach
finally
he
bethought
him
to
stick
his
loaf
on
the
end
of
a
long
iron
poker
that
he
had
and
then
stand
up
the
poker
in
the
middle
of
his
floor
still
when
he
came
back
to
his
cabin
he
would
find
his
loaf
eaten
full
of
holes
one
day
having
nothing
to
do
he
concluded
to
watch
and
see
how
the
gophers
reached
the
bread
and
this
was
what
he
saw
the
animals
climbed
up
the
side
of
his
log
cabin
ran
along
one
of
the
logs
to
a
point
opposite
the
bread
and
then
sprang
out
sidewise
toward
the
loaf
which
each
one
struck
but
upon
which
only
one
seemed
able
to
effect
a
lodgment
then
this
one
would
cling
to
the
loaf
and
act
as
a
stop
to
his
fellows
when
they
tried
a
second
time
his
body
affording
them
the
barrier
they
required
my
friend
felt
sure
that
this
leader
deliberately
and
consciously
aided
the
others
in
securing
a
footing
on
the
loaf
but
i
read
the
incident
differently
this
successful
jumper
aided
his
fellows
without
designing
it
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
compelled
him
to
the
course
he
pursued
having
effected
a
lodgment
upon
the
impaled
loaf
he
would
of
course
cling
to
it
when
the
others
jumped
so
as
not
to
be
dislodged
thereby
willy
nilly
helping
them
to
secure
a
foothold
the
coöperation
was
inevitable
and
not
the
result
of
design
the
power
to
see
straight
is
the
rarest
of
gifts
to
see
no
more
and
no
less
than
is
actually
before
you
to
be
able
to
detach
yourself
and
see
the
thing
as
it
actually
is
uncolored
or
unmodified
by
your
own
sentiments
or
prepossessions
in
short
to
see
with
your
reason
as
well
as
with
your
perceptions
that

aright
xiv
gathered
by
the
way
i
the
training
of
wild
animals
i
was
reminded
afresh
of
how
prone
we
all
are
to
regard
the
actions
of
the
lower
animals
in
the
light
of
our
own
psychology
on
reading
the
training
of
wild
animals
by
bostock
a
bostock
evidently
knows
well
the
art
of
training
animals
but
of
the
science
of
it
he
seems
to
know
very
little
that
is
while
he
is
a
successful
trainer
his
notions
of
animal
psychology
are
very
crude
for
instance
on
one
page
he
speaks
of
the
lion
as
if
it
were
endowed
with
a
fair
measure
of
human
intelligence
and
had
notions
feelings
and
thoughts
like
our
own
on
the
next
page
when
he
gets
down
to
real
business
he
lays
bare
its
utter
want
of
these
things
he
says
a
lion
born
and
bred
in
captivity
is
more
difficult
to
train
than
one
caught
from
the
jungle
then
he
gives
rein
to
his
fancy
such
a
lion
does
not
fear
man
he
knows
his
own
power
he
regards
man
as
an
inferior
with
an
attitude
of
disdain
and
silent
hauteur
he
accepts
his
food
as
tribute
and
his
care
as
homage
due
he
is
aristocratic
in
his
independence
deep
in
him
so
deep
that
he
barely
realizes
its
existence
slumbers
a
desire
for
freedom
and
an
unutterable
longing
for
the
blue
sky
and
the
free
air
when
his
training
is
begun
he
meets
it
with
a
reserved
majesty
and
silent
indifference
as
though
he
had
a
dumb
realization
of
his
wrongs
all
this
is
a
very
human
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
and
is
typical
of
the
way
we
all
most
of
us
speak
of
the
lower
animals
defining
them
to
ourselves
in
terms
of
our
own
mentality
but
it
leads
to
false
notions
about
them
we
look
upon
an
animal
fretting
and
struggling
in
its
cage
as
longing
for
freedom
picturing
to
itself
the
joy
of
the
open
air
and
the
free
hills
and
sky
when
the
truth
of
the
matter
undoubtedly
is
that
the
fluttering
bird
or
restless
fox
or
lion
simply
feels
discomfort
in
confinement
its
sufferings
are
physical
and
not
mental
its
instincts
lead
it
to
struggle
for
freedom
it
reacts
strongly
against
the
barriers
that
hold
it
and
tries
in
every
way
to
overcome
them
freedom
as
an
idea
or
a
conception
of
a
condition
of
life
is
of
course
beyond
its
capacity
bostock
shows
how
the
animal
learns
entirely
by
association
and
not
at
all
by
the
exercise
of
thought
or
reason
and
yet
a
moment
later
says
the
animal
is
becoming
amenable
to
the
mastery
of
man
and
in
doing
so
his
own
reason
is
being
developed
which
is
much
like
saying
that
when
a
man
is
practicing
on
the
flying
trapeze
his
wings
are
being
developed
the
lion
learns
slowly
through
association
through
repeated
sense
impressions
first
a
long
stick
is
put
into
his
cage
if
this
is
destroyed
it
is
replaced
by
another
until
he
gets
used
to
it
and
tolerates
its
presence
then
he
is
gently
rubbed
with
it
at
the
hands
of
his
keeper
he
gets
used
to
this
and
comes
to
like
it
then
the
stick
is
baited
with
a
piece
of
meat
and
in
taking
the
meat
the
animal
gets
still
better
acquainted
with
the
stick
and
so
ceases
to
fear
it
when
this
stage
is
reached
the
stick
is
shortened
day
by
day
until
finally
it
is
not
much
longer
than
the
hand
the
next
step
is
to
let
the
hand
take
the
place
of
the
stick
in
the
stroking
process
this
is
a
great
step
taken
for
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
is
to
get
any
wild
animal
to
allow
himself
to
be
touched
with
the
human
hand
after
a
time
a
collar
with
a
chain
attached
is
slipped
around
the
lion
neck
when
he
is
asleep
he
is
now
chained
to
one
end
of
the
cage
then
a
chair
is
introduced
into
the
cage
whereupon
this
king
of
beasts
whose
reason
is
being
developed
and
who
has
such
clear
notions
of
inferior
and
superior
and
who
knows
his
own
powers
usually
springs
for
the
chair
seeking
to
demolish
it
his
tether
prevents
his
reaching
it
and
so
in
time
he
tolerates
the
chair
then
the
trainer
after
some
preliminary
feints
walks
into
the
cage
and
seats
himself
in
the
chair
and
so
inch
by
inch
as
it
were
the
trainer
gets
control
of
the
animal
and
subdues
him
to
his
purposes
not
by
appealing
to
his
mind
for
he
has
none
but
by
impressions
upon
his
senses
leopards
panthers
and
jaguars
are
all
trained
in
much
the
same
manner
and
in
putting
them
through
their
tricks
one
invariable
order
must
be
observed
each
thing
done
one
day
must
be
done
the
next
day
in
exactly
the
same
way
there
must
be
no
deviation
from
the
rule
now
we
do
not
see
in
this
fact
the
way
of
a
thinking
or
reflecting
being
but
rather
the
way
of
a
creature
governed
by
instinct
or
unthinking
intelligence
an
animal
never
a
trick
in
the
sense
that
man
learns
it
never
sees
through
it
or
comprehends
it
has
no
image
of
it
in
its
mind
and
no
idea
of
the
relations
of
the
parts
of
it
to
one
another
it
does
it
by
reason
of
repetition
as
a
creek
wears
its
channel
and
probably
has
no
more
or
than
the
creek
has
this
i
think
is
quite
contrary
to
the
popular
notion
of
animal
life
and
mentality
but
it
is
the
conclusion
that
i
at
least
can
not
avoid
after
making
a
study
of
the
subject
ii
an
astonished
porcupine
one
summer
while
three
young
people
and
i
were
spending
an
afternoon
upon
a
our
dogs
treed
a
porcupine
at
my
suggestion
the
young
man
climbed
the
tree
not
a
large
one
to
shake
the
animal
down
i
wished
to
see
what
the
dogs
would
do
with
him
and
what
the
would
do
with
the
dogs
as
the
climber
advanced
the
rodent
went
higher
till
the
limb
he
clung
to
was
no
larger
than
wrist
this
the
young
man
seized
and
shook
vigorously
i
expected
to
see
the
slow
stupid
porcupine
drop
but
he
did
not
he
only
tightened
his
hold
the
climber
tightened
his
hold
too
and
shook
the
harder
still
the
bundle
of
quills
did
not
come
down
and
no
amount
of
shaking
could
bring
it
down
then
i
handed
a
long
pole
up
to
the
climber
and
he
tried
to
punch
the
animal
down
this
attack
in
the
rear
was
evidently
a
surprise
it
produced
an
impression
different
from
that
of
the
shaking
the
porcupine
struck
the
pole
with
his
tail
put
up
the
shield
of
quills
upon
his
back
and
assumed
his
best
attitude
of
defense
still
the
pole
persisted
in
its
persecution
regardless
of
the
quills
evidently
the
animal
was
astonished
he
had
never
had
an
experience
like
this
before
he
had
now
met
a
foe
that
despised
his
terrible
quills
then
he
began
to
back
rapidly
down
the
tree
in
the
face
of
his
enemy
the
young
man
sweetheart
stood
below
a
highly
interested
spectator
look
out
sam
he
coming
down
be
quick
he
gaining
on
you
hurry
sam
sam
came
as
fast
as
he
could
but
he
had
to
look
out
for
his
footing
and
his
antagonist
did
not
still
he
reached
the
ground
first
and
his
sweetheart
breathed
more
easily
it
looked
as
if
the
porcupine
reasoned
thus
my
quills
are
useless
against
a
foe
so
far
away
i
must
come
to
close
quarters
with
him
but
of
course
the
stupid
creature
had
no
such
mental
process
and
formed
no
such
purpose
he
had
found
the
tree
unsafe
and
his
instinct
now
was
to
get
to
the
ground
as
quickly
as
possible
and
take
refuge
among
the
rocks
as
he
came
down
i
hit
him
a
slight
blow
over
the
nose
with
a
rotten
stick
hoping
only
to
confuse
him
a
little
but
much
to
my
surprise
and
mortification
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
rolled
down
the
hill
dead
having
succumbed
to
a
blow
that
a
woodchuck
or
a
coon
would
hardly
have
regarded
at
all
thus
does
the
easy
passive
mode
of
defense
of
the
porcupine
not
only
dull
his
wits
but
it
makes
frail
and
brittle
the
thread
of
his
life
he
has
had
no
struggles
or
battles
to
harden
and
toughen
him
that
blunt
nose
of
his
is
as
tender
as
a
baby
and
he
is
snuffed
out
by
a
blow
that
would
hardly
bewilder
for
a
moment
any
other
forest
animal
unless
it
be
the
skunk
another
sluggish
of
our
woodlands
immunity
from
foes
from
effort
from
struggle
is
always
purchased
with
a
price
certain
of
our
natural
history
romancers
have
taken
liberties
with
the
porcupine
in
one
respect
they
have
shown
him
made
up
into
a
ball
and
rolling
down
a
hill
one
writer
makes
him
do
this
in
a
sportive
mood
he
rolls
down
a
long
hill
in
the
woods
and
at
the
bottom
he
is
a
ragged
mass
of
leaves
which
his
quills
have
impaled
an
apparition
that
nearly
frightened
a
rabbit
out
of
its
wits
let
any
one
who
knows
the
porcupine
try
to
fancy
it
performing
a
feat
like
this
another
romancer
makes
his
porcupine
roll
himself
into
a
ball
when
attacked
by
a
panther
and
then
on
a
nudge
from
his
enemy
roll
down
a
snowy
incline
into
the
water
i
believe
the
little
european
hedgehog
can
roll
itself
up
into
something
like
a
ball
but
our
porcupine
does
not
i
have
tried
all
sorts
of
tricks
with
him
and
made
all
sorts
of
assaults
upon
him
at
different
times
and
i
have
never
yet
seen
him
assume
the
globular
form
it
would
not
be
the
best
form
for
him
to
assume
because
it
would
partly
expose
his
vulnerable
under
side
the
one
thing
the
porcupine
seems
bent
upon
doing
at
all
times
is
to
keep
right
side
up
with
care
his
attitude
of
defense
is
crouching
close
to
the
ground
head
drawn
in
and
pressed
down
the
circular
shield
of
large
quills
upon
his
back
opened
and
extended
as
far
as
possible
and
the
tail
stretched
back
rigid
and
held
close
upon
the
ground
now
come
on
he
says
if
you
want
to
the
tail
is
his
weapon
of
active
defense
with
it
he
strikes
upward
like
lightning
and
drives
the
quills
into
whatever
they
touch
in
his
chapter
called
in
panoply
of
spears
roberts
paints
the
porcupine
without
taking
any
liberties
with
the
creature
known
habits
he
portrays
one
characteristic
of
the
porcupine
very
felicitously
as
the
porcupine
made
his
resolute
way
through
the
woods
the
manner
of
his
going
differed
from
that
of
all
the
other
kindreds
of
the
wild
he
went
not
furtively
he
had
no
particular
objection
to
making
a
noise
he
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
stop
every
little
while
stiffen
himself
to
a
monument
of
immobility
cast
wary
glances
about
the
gloom
and
sniff
the
air
for
the
taint
of
enemies
he
did
not
care
who
knew
of
his
coming
and
he
did
not
greatly
care
who
came
behind
his
panoply
of
biting
spears
he
felt
himself
secure
and
in
that
security
he
moved
as
if
he
held
in
fee
the
whole
green
shadowy
perilous
woodland
world
iii
birds
and
strings
a
college
professor
writes
me
as
follows
watching
this
morning
a
robin
attempting
to
carry
off
a
string
one
end
of
which
was
caught
in
a
tree
i
was
much
impressed
by
his
utter
lack
of
sense
he
could
not
realize
that
the
string
was
fast
or
that
it
must
be
loosened
before
it
could
be
carried
off
and
in
his
efforts
to
get
it
all
in
his
bill
he
wound
it
about
a
neighboring
limb
if
as
little
sense
were
displayed
in
using
other
material
for
nests
there
would
be
no
robins
nests
it
impressed
me
more
than
ever
with
the
important
part
played
by
instinct
who
ever
saw
any
of
our
common
birds
display
any
sense
or
judgment
in
the
handling
of
strings
strings
are
comparatively
a
new
thing
with
birds
they
are
not
a
natural
product
and
as
a
matter
of
course
birds
blunder
in
handling
them
the
oriole
uses
them
the
most
successfully
often
attaching
her
pensile
nest
to
the
branch
by
their
aid
but
she
uses
them
in
a
blind
childish
way
winding
them
round
and
round
the
branch
often
getting
them
looped
over
a
twig
or
hopelessly
tangled
and
now
and
then
hanging
herself
with
them
as
is
the
case
with
other
birds
i
have
seen
a
sparrow
a
and
a
robin
each
hung
by
a
string
it
was
using
in
the
building
of
its
nest
last
spring
in
spokane
a
boy
brought
me
a
desiccated
robin
whose
feet
were
held
together
by
a
long
thread
hopelessly
snarled
the
boy
had
found
it
hanging
to
a
tree
i
have
seen
in
a
bird
magazine
a
photograph
of
an
oriole
nest
that
had
a
string
carried
around
a
branch
apparently
a
foot
or
more
away
and
then
brought
back
and
the
end
woven
into
the
nest
it
was
given
as
a
sample
of
a
nest
the
discoverer
no
doubt
looking
upon
it
as
proof
of
an
oriole
forethought
in
providing
against
winds
and
storms
i
have
seen
an
oriole
nest
with
a
string
carried
around
a
leaf
and
another
with
a
long
looped
string
hanging
free
all
such
cases
simply
show
that
the
bird
was
not
master
of
her
material
she
bungled
the
trailing
string
caught
over
the
leaf
or
branch
and
she
drew
both
ends
in
and
fastened
them
regardless
of
what
had
happened
the
incident
only
shows
how
blindly
instinct
works
twice
i
have
seen
in
their
quest
for
trying
to
carry
away
the
strings
that
orioles
had
attached
to
branches
according
to
our
sentimental
school
of
nature
study
the
birds
should
have
untied
and
unsnarled
the
strings
in
a
human
way
but
they
did
not
they
simply
tugged
at
them
bringing
their
weight
to
bear
and
tried
to
fly
away
with
the
loose
end
in
view
of
the
ignorance
of
birds
with
regard
to
strings
how
can
we
credit
the
story
told
by
one
of
our
popular
nature
writers
of
a
pair
of
orioles
that
deliberately
impaled
a
piece
of
cloth
upon
a
thorn
in
order
that
it
might
be
held
firmly
while
they
pulled
out
the
threads
when
it
came
loose
they
refastened
it
the
story
is
incredible
for
two
reasons
the
male
oriole
does
not
assist
the
female
in
building
the
nest
he
only
furnishes
the
music
the
whole
proceeding
implies
an
amount
of
reflection
and
skill
in
dealing
with
a
new
problem
that
none
of
our
birds
possess
what
experience
has
the
race
of
orioles
had
with
cloth
that
any
member
of
it
should
know
how
to
unravel
it
in
that
way
the
whole
idea
is
absurd
iv
mimicry
to
what
lengths
the
protective
resemblance
theory
is
pushed
by
some
of
its
expounders
thus
in
the
neighborhood
of
rio
janeiro
there
are
two
species
of
hawks
that
closely
resemble
each
other
but
one
eats
only
insects
and
the
other
eats
birds
wallace
thinks
that
the
mimics
the
so
as
to
deceive
the
birds
which
are
not
afraid
of
the
latter
but
if
the
two
hawks
look
alike
would
not
the
birds
come
to
regard
them
both
as
since
one
of
them
does
eat
birds
would
they
not
at
once
identify
the
harmless
one
with
their
real
enemy
and
thus
fear
them
both
alike
if
the
latter
were
newcomers
and
vastly
in
the
minority
then
the
ruse
might
work
for
a
while
but
if
there
were
ten
harmless
hawks
around
to
one
dangerous
one
the
former
would
quickly
suffer
from
the
character
of
the
latter
in
the
estimation
of
the
birds
birds
are
instinctively
afraid
of
all
hawk
kind
wallace
thinks
it
may
be
an
advantage
to
cuckoos
a
rather
feeble
class
of
birds
to
resemble
the
hawks
but
this
seems
to
me
true
it
is
if
the
sheep
could
imitate
the
wolf
its
enemies
might
keep
clear
of
it
why
then
has
not
this
resemblance
been
brought
about
our
cuckoo
is
a
feeble
and
defenseless
bird
also
but
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
hawk
the
same
can
be
said
of
scores
of
other
birds
many
of
these
close
resemblances
among
different
species
of
animals
are
no
doubt
purely
accidental
or
the
result
of
the
same
law
of
variation
acting
under
similar
conditions
we
have
a
hummingbird
moth
that
so
closely
in
its
form
and
flight
and
manner
resembles
a
hummingbird
that
if
this
resemblance
brought
it
any
immunity
from
danger
it
would
be
set
down
as
a
clear
case
of
mimicry
there
is
such
a
moth
in
england
too
where
no
hummingbird
is
found
why
should
not
nature
repeat
herself
in
this
way
this
moth
feeds
upon
the
nectar
of
flowers
like
the
hummingbird
and
why
should
it
not
have
the
hummingbird
form
and
manner
then
there
are
accidental
resemblances
in
nature
such
as
the
resemblance
of
knots
of
trees
and
of
vegetables
to
the
human
form
and
of
a
certain
fungus
to
a
part
of
man
anatomy
we
have
a
fly
that
resembles
a
in
my
days
i
used
to
call
it
the
mock
it
would
come
up
the
wind
on
the
scent
of
my
bee
box
and
hum
about
it
precisely
like
a
real
bee
of
course
it
was
here
before
the
and
has
been
evolved
quite
independently
of
it
it
feeds
upon
the
pollen
and
nectar
of
flowers
like
the
true
bee
and
is
therefore
of
similar
form
and
color
the
has
its
enemies
the
toads
and
feed
upon
it
and
the
kingbird
captures
the
slow
drone
when
an
edible
butterfly
mimics
an
inedible
or
noxious
one
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
the
tropics
the
mimicker
is
no
doubt
the
gainer
it
makes
a
big
difference
whether
the
mimicker
is
seeking
to
escape
from
an
enemy
or
seeking
to
deceive
its
prey
i
fail
to
see
how
in
the
latter
case
any
disguise
of
form
or
color
could
be
brought
about
our
shrike
at
times
murders
little
birds
and
eats
out
their
brains
and
it
has
not
the
form
or
the
color
or
the
eye
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
thus
probably
deceives
its
victims
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
guise
is
the
result
of
any
sort
of
mimicry
the
colors
of
fruits
wallace
even
looks
upon
the
nuts
as
protectively
colored
because
they
are
not
to
be
eaten
but
without
the
agency
of
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
how
are
the
heavy
nuts
such
as
the
chestnut
beechnut
acorn
butternut
and
the
like
to
be
scattered
the
blue
jay
is
often
busy
hours
at
a
time
in
the
fall
planting
chestnuts
and
acorns
and
red
squirrels
carry
butternuts
and
walnuts
far
from
the
parent
trees
and
place
them
in
forked
limbs
and
holes
for
future
use
of
course
many
of
these
fall
to
the
ground
and
take
root
if
the
protective
coloration
of
the
nuts
then
were
effective
it
would
defeat
a
purpose
which
every
tree
and
shrub
and
plant
has
at
heart
namely
the
scattering
of
its
seed
i
notice
that
the
on
the
sycamores
are
protectively
colored
also
and
certainly
they
do
not
crave
concealment
it
is
true
that
they
hang
on
the
naked
trees
till
spring
when
no
concealment
is
possible
it
is
also
true
that
the
jays
and
the
crows
carry
away
the
chestnuts
from
the
open
burrs
on
the
trees
where
no
color
scheme
would
conceal
them
but
the
squirrels
find
them
upon
the
ground
even
beneath
the
snow
being
guided
no
doubt
by
the
sense
of
smell
the
hickory
nut
is
almost
white
why
does
it
not
seek
concealment
also
it
is
just
as
helpless
as
the
others
and
is
just
as
it
occurs
to
me
that
birds
can
do
nothing
with
it
on
account
of
its
thick
shell
it
needs
therefore
to
attract
some
creature
that
will
carry
it
away
from
the
parent
tree
and
this
is
done
by
the
mice
and
the
squirrels
but
if
this
is
the
reason
of
its
whiteness
there
is
the
dusky
butternut
and
the
black
walnut
both
more
or
less
concealed
by
their
color
and
yet
having
the
same
need
of
some
creature
to
scatter
them
the
seeds
of
the
maple
and
of
the
ash
and
the
linden
are
obscurely
colored
and
they
are
winged
hence
they
do
not
need
the
aid
of
any
creature
in
their
dissemination
to
say
that
this
is
the
reason
of
their
dull
unattractive
tints
would
be
an
explanation
on
a
par
with
much
that
one
hears
about
the
significance
of
animal
and
vegetable
coloration
why
is
corn
so
bright
colored
and
wheat
and
barley
so
dull
and
rice
so
white
no
doubt
there
is
a
reason
in
each
case
but
i
doubt
if
that
reason
has
any
relation
to
the
surrounding
animal
life
the
new
botany
teaches
that
the
flowers
have
color
and
perfume
to
attract
the
insects
to
aid
in
their
fertilization
a
need
so
paramount
with
all
plants
because
plants
that
are
fertilized
by
aid
of
the
wind
have
very
inconspicuous
flowers
is
it
equally
true
that
the
high
color
of
most
fruits
is
to
attract
some
hungry
creature
to
come
and
eat
them
and
thus
scatter
the
seeds
from
the
dwarf
cornel
or
in
the
woods
to
the
red
thorn
in
the
fields
every
plant
and
shrub
and
tree
seems
to
advertise
itself
to
the
in
its
bright
hues
apparently
there
is
no
other
use
to
the
plant
of
the
fleshy
pericarp
than
to
serve
as
a
bait
or
wage
for
some
animal
to
come
and
sow
its
seed
why
then
should
it
not
take
on
these
alluring
colors
to
help
along
this
end
and
yet
there
comes
the
thought
may
not
this
scarlet
and
gold
of
the
berries
and
tree
fruits
be
the
inevitable
result
of
the
chemistry
of
ripening
as
it
is
with
the
autumn
foliage
what
benefit
to
the
tree
directly
or
indirectly
is
all
this
wealth
of
color
of
the
autumn
many
of
the
toadstools
are
highly
colored
also
how
do
they
profit
by
it
many
of
the
shells
upon
the
beach
are
very
showy
to
what
end
the
find
the
pale
as
readily
as
they
do
the
brilliant
murillos
and
the
dull
blue
cedar
berries
and
the
duller
drupes
of
the
lotus
are
not
concealed
from
them
nor
from
the
robins
but
it
is
true
that
the
greenish
white
grapes
in
the
vineyard
do
not
suffer
from
the
attacks
of
the
birds
as
do
the
blue
and
red
ones
the
reason
probably
is
that
the
birds
regard
them
as
unripe
the
white
grape
is
quite
recent
and
the
birds
have
not
yet
caught
on
poisonous
fruits
are
also
highly
colored
to
what
end
in
bermuda
i
saw
on
low
bushes
great
masses
of
what
they
called
of
a
brilliant
yellow
color
and
very
tempting
yet
i
was
assured
they
were
poisonous
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
if
anything
eats
the
red
berries
of
our
wild
turnip
or
arum
i
doubt
if
any
bird
or
beast
could
stand
them
wherefore
then
are
they
so
brightly
colored
i
am
also
equally
curious
to
know
if
anything
eats
the
fruit
of
the
red
and
white
baneberry
and
the
blue
cohosh
the
seeds
of
some
wild
fruit
such
as
the
climbing
are
so
soft
that
it
seems
impossible
they
should
pass
through
the
gizzard
of
a
bird
and
not
be
destroyed
the
fruit
of
the
sumac
comes
the
nearest
to
being
a
cheat
of
anything
i
know
of
in
nature
a
collection
of
seeds
covered
with
a
flannel
coat
with
just
a
perceptible
acid
taste
and
all
highly
colored
unless
the
seed
itself
is
digested
what
is
there
to
tempt
the
bird
to
devour
it
or
to
reward
it
for
so
doing
in
the
tropics
one
sees
fruits
that
do
not
become
bright
colored
on
ripening
such
as
the
breadfruit
the
custard
apple
the
naseberry
the
mango
and
tropical
foliage
never
colors
up
as
does
the
foliage
of
northern
trees
vi
instinct
many
false
notions
seem
to
be
current
in
the
popular
mind
about
instinct
apparently
some
of
our
writers
on
natural
history
themes
would
like
to
discard
the
word
entirely
now
instinct
is
not
opposed
to
intelligence
it
is
intelligence
of
the
unlearned
unconscious
kind
the
intelligence
innate
in
nature
we
use
the
word
to
distinguish
a
gift
or
faculty
which
animals
possess
and
which
is
independent
of
instruction
and
experience
from
the
mental
equipment
of
man
which
depends
mainly
upon
instruction
and
experience
a
man
has
to
be
taught
to
do
that
which
the
lower
animals
do
from
nature
hence
the
animals
do
not
progress
in
knowledge
while
man
progress
is
almost
limitless
a
man
is
an
animal
born
again
into
a
higher
spiritual
plane
he
has
lost
or
shed
many
of
his
animal
instincts
in
the
process
but
he
has
gained
the
capacity
for
great
and
wonderful
improvement
instinct
is
opposed
to
reason
to
reflection
to
thought
to
that
kind
of
intelligence
which
knows
and
takes
cognizance
of
itself
instinct
is
that
lower
form
of
intelligence
which
acts
through
the
senses
sense
perception
sense
association
sense
memory
which
we
share
with
the
animals
though
their
eyes
and
ears
and
noses
are
often
quicker
and
keener
than
ours
hence
the
animals
know
only
the
present
visible
objective
world
while
man
through
his
gift
of
reason
and
thought
knows
the
inward
world
of
ideas
and
ideal
relations
an
animal
for
the
most
part
knows
all
that
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
know
as
soon
as
it
reaches
maturity
what
it
learns
beyond
that
what
it
learns
at
the
hands
of
the
for
instance
it
learns
slowly
through
a
long
repetition
of
the
process
of
trial
and
failure
man
also
achieves
many
things
through
practice
alone
or
through
the
same
process
of
trial
and
failure
much
of
his
manual
skill
comes
in
this
way
but
he
learns
certain
things
through
the
exercise
of
his
reason
he
sees
how
the
thing
is
done
and
the
relation
of
the
elements
of
the
problem
to
one
another
the
trained
animal
never
sees
the
thing
is
done
it
simply
does
it
automatically
because
certain
sense
impressions
have
been
stamped
upon
it
till
a
habit
has
been
formed
just
as
a
man
will
often
wind
his
watch
before
going
to
bed
or
do
some
other
accustomed
act
without
thinking
of
it
the
bird
builds
her
nest
and
builds
it
intelligently
that
is
she
adapts
means
to
an
end
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
about
it
in
the
sense
that
man
does
when
he
builds
his
house
the
instinct
is
stimulated
into
activity
by
outward
conditions
of
place
and
climate
and
food
supply
as
truly
as
the
growth
of
a
plant
is
thus
stimulated
as
i
look
upon
the
matter
the
most
wonderful
and
ingenious
nests
in
the
world
as
those
of
the
and
orioles
show
no
more
independent
and
thought
than
does
the
rude
nest
of
the
pigeon
or
the
cuckoo
they
evince
a
higher
grade
of
intelligent
instinct
and
that
is
all
both
are
equally
the
result
of
natural
promptings
and
not
of
acquired
skill
or
the
lack
of
it
one
species
of
bird
will
occasionally
learn
the
song
of
another
species
but
the
song
impulse
must
be
there
to
begin
with
and
this
must
be
stimulated
in
the
right
way
at
the
right
time
a
caged
english
sparrow
has
been
known
to
learn
the
song
of
the
canary
caged
with
or
near
it
but
the
sparrow
certainly
inherits
the
song
impulse
one
has
proof
of
this
when
he
hears
a
company
of
these
sparrows
sitting
in
a
tree
in
spring
chattering
and
chirping
in
unison
and
almost
reaching
an
utterance
that
is
our
does
not
seem
to
have
the
song
impulse
and
i
doubt
if
it
could
ever
be
taught
to
sing
in
like
manner
our
ruffed
grouse
has
but
feeble
vocal
powers
and
i
do
not
suppose
it
would
learn
to
crow
or
cackle
if
brought
up
in
the
it
expresses
its
joy
at
the
return
of
spring
and
the
mating
season
in
its
drum
as
do
the
woodpeckers
the
recent
english
writer
richard
kearton
says
there
is
no
such
dead
level
of
unreasoning
instinct
in
the
animal
world
as
is
popularly
supposed
and
he
seems
to
base
the
remark
upon
the
fact
that
he
found
certain
of
the
cavities
or
holes
in
a
where
sparrows
roosted
lined
with
feathers
while
others
were
not
lined
such
departures
from
a
level
line
of
habit
as
this
are
common
enough
among
all
creatures
instinct
is
not
something
as
rigid
as
cast
iron
it
does
not
invariably
act
like
a
machine
always
the
same
the
animal
is
something
alive
and
is
subject
to
the
law
of
variation
instinct
may
act
more
strongly
in
one
kind
than
in
another
just
as
reason
may
act
more
strongly
in
one
man
than
in
another
or
as
one
animal
may
have
greater
speed
or
courage
than
another
of
the
same
species
it
would
be
hard
to
find
two
live
creatures
very
far
up
in
the
scale
exactly
alike
a
thrush
may
use
much
mud
in
the
construction
of
its
nest
or
it
may
use
little
or
none
at
all
the
oriole
may
weave
strings
into
its
nest
or
it
may
use
only
dry
grasses
and
such
cases
only
show
variations
in
the
action
of
instinct
but
if
an
oriole
should
build
a
nest
like
a
robin
or
a
robin
build
like
a
cliff
swallow
that
would
be
a
departure
from
instinct
to
take
note
of
some
birds
show
a
much
higher
degree
of
variability
than
others
some
species
vary
much
in
song
others
in
nesting
and
in
feeding
habits
i
have
never
noticed
much
variation
in
the
songs
of
robins
but
in
their
they
vary
constantly
thus
one
nest
will
be
almost
destitute
of
mud
while
another
will
be
composed
almost
mainly
of
mud
one
will
have
a
large
mass
of
dry
grass
and
weeds
as
its
foundation
while
the
next
one
will
have
little
or
no
foundation
of
the
kind
the
sites
chosen
vary
still
more
ranging
from
the
ground
all
the
way
to
the
tops
of
trees
i
have
seen
a
robin
nest
built
in
the
centre
of
a
small
box
that
held
a
clump
of
ferns
which
stood
by
the
roadside
on
the
top
of
a
low
post
near
a
house
and
without
cover
or
shield
of
any
sort
the
robin
had
welded
her
nest
so
completely
to
the
soil
in
the
box
that
the
whole
could
be
lifted
by
the
rim
of
the
nest
she
had
given
a
very
pretty
and
unique
effect
to
the
nest
by
a
border
of
fine
dark
rootlets
skillfully
woven
together
the
song
sparrow
shows
a
high
degree
of
variability
both
in
its
song
and
in
its
each
bird
having
several
songs
of
its
own
while
one
may
nest
upon
the
ground
and
another
in
a
low
bush
or
in
the
vines
on
the
side
of
your
house
the
vesper
sparrow
on
the
other
hand
shows
a
much
lower
degree
of
variability
the
individuals
rarely
differing
in
their
songs
while
all
the
nests
i
have
ever
found
of
this
sparrow
were
in
open
grassy
fields
upon
the
ground
the
chipping
or
social
sparrow
is
usually
very
constant
in
its
song
and
its
and
yet
one
season
a
chippy
built
her
nest
in
an
old
robin
nest
in
the
vines
on
my
porch
it
was
a
very
pretty
instance
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
little
bird
another
chippy
that
i
knew
had
an
original
song
one
that
resembled
the
sound
of
a
small
tin
whistle
the
bush
sparrow
too
is
pretty
constant
in
choosing
a
bush
in
which
to
place
its
nest
yet
i
once
found
the
nest
of
this
sparrow
upon
the
ground
in
an
open
field
with
suitable
bushes
within
a
few
yards
of
it
the
woodpeckers
the
jays
the
cuckoos
the
pewees
the
warblers
and
other
wood
birds
show
only
a
low
degree
of
variability
in
song
feeding
and
nesting
habits
the
baltimore
oriole
makes
free
use
of
strings
in
its
and
the
songs
of
different
birds
of
this
species
vary
greatly
while
the
orchard
oriole
makes
no
use
of
strings
so
far
as
i
have
observed
and
its
song
is
always
and
everywhere
the
same
hence
we
may
say
that
the
lives
of
some
birds
run
much
more
in
ruts
than
do
those
of
others
they
show
less
plasticity
of
instinct
and
are
perhaps
for
that
reason
less
near
the
state
of
free
intelligence
organic
life
in
all
its
forms
is
flexible
instinct
is
flexible
the
habits
of
all
the
animals
change
more
or
less
with
changed
conditions
but
the
range
of
the
fluctuations
in
the
lives
of
the
wild
creatures
is
very
limited
and
is
always
determined
by
surrounding
circumstances
and
not
by
individual
volition
as
it
so
often
is
in
the
case
of
man
in
a
treeless
country
birds
that
sing
on
the
perch
elsewhere
will
sing
on
the
wing
the
black
bear
in
the
southern
states
holes
up
for
a
much
shorter
period
than
in
canada
or
the
rockies
why
is
the
spruce
grouse
so
stupid
compared
with
most
other
species
why
is
the
canada
jay
so
tame
and
familiar
about
your
camp
in
the
northern
woods
or
in
the
rockies
and
the
other
jays
so
wary
such
variations
of
course
have
their
natural
explanation
whatever
it
may
be
in
new
zealand
there
is
a
parrot
the
kea
that
once
lived
upon
honey
and
fruit
but
that
now
lives
upon
the
sheep
tearing
its
way
down
to
the
kidney
fat
this
is
a
wide
departure
in
instinct
but
it
is
not
to
be
read
as
a
development
of
reason
in
its
place
it
is
a
modified
instinct
the
instinct
for
food
seeking
new
sources
of
supply
exactly
how
it
came
about
would
be
interesting
to
know
our
oriole
is
an
insectivorous
bird
but
in
some
localities
it
is
very
destructive
in
the
august
vineyards
it
does
not
become
a
like
the
robin
but
a
it
punctures
the
grapes
for
their
unfermented
wine
here
again
we
have
a
case
of
modified
and
adaptive
instinct
all
animals
are
more
or
less
adaptive
and
avail
themselves
of
new
sources
of
food
supply
when
the
southern
savannas
were
planted
with
rice
the
bobolinks
soon
found
that
this
food
suited
them
a
few
years
ago
we
had
a
great
visitation
in
the
hudson
river
valley
of
crossbills
from
the
north
they
lingered
till
the
fruit
of
the
peach
orchards
had
set
when
they
discovered
that
here
was
a
new
source
of
food
supply
and
they
became
very
destructive
to
the
promised
crop
by
deftly
cutting
out
the
embryo
peaches
all
such
cases
show
how
plastic
and
adaptive
instinct
is
at
least
in
relation
to
food
supplies
let
me
again
say
that
instinct
is
native
untaught
intelligence
directed
outward
but
never
inward
as
in
man
vii
the
robin
probably
with
us
no
other
bird
is
so
closely
associated
with
country
life
as
the
robin
most
of
the
time
pleasantly
but
for
a
brief
season
during
cherry
time
unpleasantly
his
life
touches
or
mingles
with
ours
at
many
points
in
the
dooryard
in
the
garden
in
the
orchard
along
the
road
in
the
groves
in
the
woods
he
is
everywhere
except
in
the
depths
of
the
primitive
forests
and
he
is
always
very
much
at
home
he
does
not
hang
timidly
upon
the
skirts
of
our
rural
life
like
say
the
thrasher
or
the
chewink
he
plunges
in
boldly
and
takes
his
chances
and
his
share
and
often
more
than
his
share
of
whatever
is
going
what
vigor
what
cheer
how
persistent
how
prolific
how
adaptive
pugnacious
but
cheery
pilfering
but
companionable
when
one
first
sees
his
ruddy
breast
upon
the
lawn
in
spring
or
his
pert
form
outlined
against
a
patch
of
lingering
snow
in
the
brown
fields
or
hears
his
simple
carol
from
the
top
of
a
leafless
tree
at
sundown
what
a
vernal
thrill
it
gives
one
what
a
train
of
pleasant
associations
is
quickened
into
life
what
pictures
he
makes
upon
the
lawn
what
attitudes
he
strikes
see
him
seize
a
worm
and
yank
it
from
its
burrow
i
recently
observed
a
robin
boring
for
grubs
in
a
country
dooryard
it
is
a
common
enough
sight
to
witness
one
seize
an
and
drag
it
from
its
burrow
in
the
turf
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
before
saw
one
drill
for
grubs
and
bring
the
big
white
morsel
to
the
surface
the
robin
i
am
speaking
of
had
a
nest
of
young
in
a
maple
near
by
and
she
worked
the
neighborhood
very
industriously
for
food
she
would
run
along
over
the
short
grass
after
the
manner
of
robins
stopping
every
few
feet
her
form
stiff
and
erect
now
and
then
she
would
suddenly
bend
her
head
toward
the
ground
and
bring
eye
or
ear
for
a
moment
to
bear
intently
upon
it
then
she
would
spring
to
boring
the
turf
vigorously
with
her
bill
changing
her
attitude
at
each
stroke
alert
and
watchful
throwing
up
the
grass
roots
and
little
jets
of
soil
stabbing
deeper
and
deeper
growing
every
moment
more
and
more
excited
till
finally
a
fat
grub
was
seized
and
brought
forth
time
after
time
during
several
days
i
saw
her
mine
for
grubs
in
this
way
and
drag
them
forth
how
did
she
know
where
to
drill
the
insect
was
in
every
case
an
inch
below
the
surface
did
she
hear
it
gnawing
the
roots
of
the
grasses
or
did
she
see
a
movement
in
the
turf
beneath
which
the
grub
was
at
work
i
know
not
i
only
know
that
she
struck
her
game
unerringly
each
time
only
twice
did
i
see
her
make
a
few
thrusts
and
then
desist
as
if
she
had
been
for
the
moment
deceived
how
pugnacious
the
robin
is
with
what
spunk
and
spirit
he
defends
himself
against
his
enemies
every
spring
i
see
the
robins
mobbing
the
blue
jays
that
go
sneaking
through
the
trees
looking
for
eggs
the
crow
blackbirds
nest
in
my
evergreens
and
there
is
perpetual
war
between
them
and
the
robins
the
blackbirds
devour
the
robins
eggs
and
the
robins
never
cease
to
utter
their
protest
often
backing
it
up
with
blows
i
saw
two
robins
attack
a
young
blackbird
in
the
air
and
they
tweaked
out
his
feathers
at
a
lively
rate
one
spring
a
pack
of
robins
killed
a
cuckoo
near
me
that
they
found
robbing
a
nest
i
did
not
witness
the
killing
but
i
have
a
number
of
people
who
did
see
it
and
i
am
convinced
of
the
fact
they
set
upon
him
when
he
was
on
the
robin
nest
and
left
him
so
bruised
and
helpless
beneath
it
that
he
soon
died
it
was
the
first
intimation
i
had
ever
had
that
the
cuckoo
devoured
the
eggs
of
other
birds
two
other
cases
have
come
to
my
knowledge
of
robins
killing
cuckoos
the
in
may
the
robin
knows
its
enemies
and
it
is
quite
certain
i
think
that
the
cuckoo
is
one
of
them
what
a
hustler
the
robin
is
no
wonder
he
gets
on
in
the
world
he
is
early
he
is
handy
he
is
adaptive
he
is
tenacious
before
the
leaves
are
out
in
april
the
female
begins
her
nest
concealing
it
as
much
as
she
can
in
a
or
placing
it
under
a
shed
or
porch
or
even
under
an
overhanging
bank
upon
the
ground
one
spring
a
robin
built
her
nest
upon
the
ladder
that
was
hung
up
beneath
the
eaves
of
the
having
occasion
to
use
the
ladder
we
placed
the
nest
on
a
box
that
stood
beneath
it
the
robin
was
disturbed
at
first
but
soon
went
on
with
her
incubating
in
the
new
and
more
exposed
position
the
same
spring
one
built
her
nest
upon
a
beam
in
a
fruit
house
going
out
and
in
through
the
unshingled
roof
one
day
just
as
the
eggs
were
hatched
we
completed
the
roof
and
kept
up
a
hammering
about
the
place
till
near
night
the
mother
robin
scolded
a
good
deal
but
she
did
not
desert
her
young
and
soon
found
her
way
in
and
out
the
door
if
a
robin
makes
up
her
mind
to
build
upon
your
porch
and
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you
do
not
want
her
there
there
is
likely
to
be
considerable
trouble
on
both
sides
before
the
matter
is
settled
the
robin
gets
the
start
of
you
in
the
morning
and
has
her
heap
of
dry
grass
and
straws
in
place
before
the
jealous
broom
is
stirring
and
she
persists
after
you
have
cleaned
out
her
rubbish
half
a
dozen
times
before
you
have
discouraged
her
you
may
have
to
shunt
her
off
of
every
plate
or
other
coign
of
vantage
with
boards
or
shingles
a
strenuous
bird
indeed
and
a
hustler
viii
the
crow
one
very
cold
winter
morning
after
a
fall
of
nearly
two
feet
of
snow
as
i
came
out
of
my
door
three
crows
were
perched
in
an
apple
tree
but
a
few
rods
away
one
of
them
uttered
a
peculiar
caw
as
they
saw
me
but
they
did
not
fly
away
it
was
not
the
usual
note
of
alarm
it
may
have
meant
look
out
yet
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
asking
of
alms
here
we
are
three
hungry
neighbors
of
yours
give
us
food
so
i
brought
out
the
entrails
and
legs
of
a
chicken
and
placed
them
upon
the
snow
the
crows
very
soon
discovered
what
i
had
done
and
with
the
usual
suspicious
movement
of
the
closed
wings
which
has
the
effect
of
emphasizing
the
birds
alertness
approached
and
devoured
the
food
or
carried
it
away
but
there
was
not
the
least
strife
or
dispute
among
them
over
the
food
indeed
each
seemed
ready
to
give
precedence
to
the
others
in
fact
the
crow
is
a
courtly
bird
birds
of
prey
will
rend
one
another
over
their
food
even
buzzards
will
make
some
show
of
mauling
one
another
with
their
wings
but
i
have
yet
to
see
anything
of
the
kind
with
that
gentle
freebooter
the
crow
yet
suspicion
is
his
dominant
trait
anything
that
looks
like
design
puts
him
on
his
guard
the
simplest
device
in
a
cornfield
usually
suffices
to
keep
him
away
he
suspects
a
trap
his
wit
is
not
deep
but
it
is
quick
and
ever
on
the
alert
one
of
our
natural
history
romancers
makes
the
crows
flock
in
june
but
the
truth
is
they
do
not
flock
till
september
through
the
summer
the
different
families
keep
pretty
well
together
you
may
see
the
old
ones
with
their
young
foraging
about
the
fields
the
young
often
being
fed
by
their
parents
from
my
boyhood
i
have
seen
the
yearly
meeting
of
the
crows
in
september
or
october
on
a
high
grassy
hill
or
a
wooded
ridge
apparently
all
the
crows
from
a
large
area
assemble
at
these
times
you
may
see
them
coming
singly
or
in
loose
bands
from
all
directions
to
the
rendezvous
till
there
are
hundreds
of
them
together
they
make
black
an
acre
or
two
of
ground
at
intervals
they
all
rise
in
the
air
and
wheel
about
all
cawing
at
once
then
to
the
ground
again
or
to
the
as
the
case
may
be
then
rising
again
they
send
forth
the
voice
of
the
multitude
what
does
it
all
mean
i
notice
that
this
rally
is
always
preliminary
to
their
going
into
winter
quarters
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
just
the
nature
of
the
communication
that
takes
place
between
them
not
long
afterwards
or
early
in
october
they
may
be
seen
morning
and
evening
going
to
and
from
their
rookeries
the
matter
seems
to
be
settled
in
these
september
gatherings
of
the
clan
was
the
spot
agreed
upon
beforehand
and
notice
served
upon
all
the
members
of
the
tribe
our
professors
would
probably
infer
something
of
the
kind
i
suspect
it
is
all
brought
about
as
naturally
as
any
other
aggregation
of
animals
a
few
crows
meet
on
the
hill
they
attract
others
and
still
others
the
rising
of
a
body
of
them
in
the
air
the
circling
and
cawing
may
be
an
instinctive
act
to
advertise
the
meeting
to
all
the
crows
within
sight
or
hearing
at
any
rate
it
has
this
effect
and
they
come
hurrying
from
all
points
what
their
various
calls
mean
who
shall
tell
that
lusty
that
one
hears
in
spring
and
summer
like
the
voice
of
authority
or
command
what
does
it
mean
i
never
could
find
out
it
is
doubtless
from
the
male
a
crow
will
utter
it
while
sitting
alone
on
the
fence
in
the
pasture
as
well
as
when
flying
through
the
air
the
crow
cry
of
alarm
is
easily
distinguished
all
the
other
birds
and
wild
creatures
know
it
and
the
hunter
who
is
stalking
his
game
is
apt
to
swear
when
he
hears
it
i
have
heard
two
crows
in
the
spring
seated
on
a
limb
close
together
give
utterance
to
many
curious
guttural
gurgling
ventriloquial
sounds
what
were
they
saying
it
was
probably
some
form
of
the
language
of
love
i
venture
to
say
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
heard
the
crow
utter
a
complaining
or
a
disconsolate
note
he
is
always
cheery
he
is
always
he
is
a
great
success
nothing
in
bermuda
made
me
feel
so
much
at
home
as
a
flock
of
half
a
dozen
of
our
crows
which
i
saw
and
heard
there
at
one
time
they
were
very
numerous
on
the
island
but
they
have
been
persecuted
till
only
a
remnant
of
the
tribe
remains
i
my
friend
and
neighbor

the
year

of
my
crops
of

and
grain

woods

find
a
flaw
in
thy
title

the
earth

about

quickly
noting
