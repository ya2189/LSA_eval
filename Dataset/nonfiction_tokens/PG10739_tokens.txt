preface
the
following
essays
are
drawn
from
the
chapters
entitled
and
rechtslehre
und
which
are
to
be
found
both
in
schopenhauer
and
in
his
posthumous
writings
as
in
my
previous
volumes
so
also
in
this
i
have
omitted
a
few
passages
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
either
antiquated
or
no
longer
of
any
general
interest
for
convenience
sake
i
have
divided
the
original
chapters
into
sections
which
i
have
had
to
name
and
i
have
also
had
to
invent
a
title
which
should
express
their
real
scope
the
reader
will
find
that
it
is
not
so
much
and
that
are
here
treated
as
human
nature
itself
in
various
aspects
human
nature
truths
of
the
physical
order
may
possess
much
external
significance
but
internal
significance
they
have
none
the
latter
is
the
privilege
of
intellectual
and
moral
truths
which
are
concerned
with
the
objectivation
of
the
will
in
its
highest
stages
whereas
physical
truths
are
concerned
with
it
in
its
lowest
for
example
if
we
could
establish
the
truth
of
what
up
till
now
is
only
a
conjecture
namely
that
it
is
the
action
of
the
sun
which
produces
thermoelectricity
at
the
equator
that
this
produces
terrestrial
magnetism
and
that
this
magnetism
again
is
the
cause
of
the
these
would
be
truths
externally
of
great
but
internally
of
little
significance
on
the
other
hand
examples
of
internal
significance
are
furnished
by
all
great
and
true
philosophical
systems
by
the
catastrophe
of
every
good
tragedy
nay
even
by
the
observation
of
human
conduct
in
the
extreme
manifestations
of
its
morality
and
immorality
of
its
good
and
its
evil
character
for
all
these
are
expressions
of
that
reality
which
takes
outward
shape
as
the
world
and
which
in
the
highest
stages
of
its
objectivation
proclaims
its
innermost
nature
to
say
that
the
world
has
only
a
physical
and
not
a
moral
significance
is
the
greatest
and
most
pernicious
of
all
errors
the
fundamental
blunder
the
real
perversity
of
mind
and
temper
and
at
bottom
it
is
doubtless
the
tendency
which
faith
personifies
as
nevertheless
in
spite
of
all
religions
and
they
are
systems
which
one
and
all
maintain
the
opposite
and
seek
to
establish
it
in
their
mythical
way
this
fundamental
error
never
becomes
quite
extinct
but
raises
its
head
from
time
to
time
afresh
until
universal
indignation
compels
it
to
hide
itself
once
more
yet
however
certain
we
may
feel
of
the
moral
significance
of
life
and
the
world
to
explain
and
illustrate
it
and
to
resolve
the
contradiction
between
this
significance
and
the
world
as
it
is
form
a
task
of
great
difficulty
so
great
indeed
as
to
make
it
possible
that
it
has
remained
for
me
to
exhibit
the
true
and
only
genuine
and
sound
basis
of
morality
everywhere
and
at
all
times
effective
together
with
the
results
to
which
it
leads
the
actual
facts
of
morality
are
too
much
on
my
side
for
me
to
fear
that
my
theory
can
ever
be
replaced
or
upset
by
any
other
however
so
long
as
even
my
ethical
system
continues
to
be
ignored
by
the
professorial
world
it
is
kant
moral
principle
that
prevails
in
the
universities
among
its
various
forms
the
one
which
is
most
in
favour
at
present
is
the
dignity
of
man
i
have
already
exposed
the
absurdity
of
this
doctrine
in
my
treatise
on
the
of
therefore
i
will
only
say
here
that
if
the
question
were
asked
on
what
the
alleged
dignity
of
man
rests
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
answer
was
made
that
it
rests
upon
his
morality
in
other
words
his
morality
rests
upon
his
dignity
and
his
dignity
rests
upon
his
morality
footnote
but
apart
from
this
circular
argument
it
seems
to
me
that
the
idea
of
dignity
can
be
applied
only
in
an
ironical
sense
to
a
being
whose
will
is
so
sinful
whose
intellect
is
so
limited
whose
body
is
so
weak
and
perishable
as
man
how
shall
a
man
be
proud
when
his
conception
is
a
crime
his
birth
a
penalty
his
life
a
labour
and
death
a
necessity
superbit
homo
cujus
conceptio
culpa
nasci
poena
labor
vita
necesse
therefore
in
opposition
to
the
form
of
the
kantian
principle
i
should
be
inclined
to
lay
down
the
following
rule
when
you
come
into
contact
with
a
man
no
matter
whom
do
not
attempt
an
objective
appreciation
of
him
according
to
his
worth
and
dignity
do
not
consider
his
bad
will
or
his
narrow
understanding
and
perverse
ideas
as
the
former
may
easily
lead
you
to
hate
and
the
latter
to
despise
him
but
fix
your
attention
only
upon
his
sufferings
his
needs
his
anxieties
his
pains
then
you
will
always
feel
your
kinship
with
him
you
will
sympathise
with
him
and
instead
of
hatred
or
contempt
you
will
experience
the
commiseration
that
alone
is
the
peace
to
which
the
gospel
calls
us
the
way
to
keep
down
hatred
and
contempt
is
certainly
not
to
look
for
a
man
alleged
dignity
but
on
the
contrary
to
regard
him
as
an
object
of
pity
the
buddhists
as
the
result
of
the
more
profound
views
which
they
entertain
on
ethical
and
metaphysical
subjects
start
from
the
cardinal
vices
and
not
the
cardinal
virtues
since
the
virtues
make
their
appearance
only
as
the
contraries
or
negations
of
the
vices
according
to
schmidt
of
the
eastern
the
cardinal
vices
in
the
buddhist
scheme
are
four
lust
indolence
anger
and
avarice
but
probably
instead
of
indolence
we
should
read
pride
for
so
it
stands
in
the
édifiantes
et
where
envy
or
hatred
is
added
as
a
fifth
i
am
confirmed
in
correcting
the
statement
of
the
excellent
schmidt
by
the
fact
that
my
rendering
agrees
with
the
doctrine
of
the
sufis
who
are
certainly
under
the
influence
of
the
brahmins
and
buddhists
the
sufis
also
maintain
that
there
are
four
cardinal
vices
and
they
arrange
them
in
very
striking
pairs
so
that
lust
appears
in
connection
with
avarice
and
anger
with
pride
the
four
cardinal
virtues
opposed
to
them
would
be
chastity
and
generosity
together
with
gentleness
and
humility
footnote
edit
of
vol
p
when
we
compare
these
profound
ideas
of
morality
as
they
are
entertained
by
oriental
nations
with
the
celebrated
cardinal
virtues
of
plato
which
have
been
recapitulated
again
and
again
justice
valour
temperance
and
wisdom
it
is
plain
that
the
latter
are
not
based
on
any
clear
leading
idea
but
are
chosen
on
grounds
that
are
superficial
and
in
part
obviously
false
virtues
must
be
qualities
of
the
will
but
wisdom
is
chiefly
an
attribute
of
the
intellect
greek
sophrosynae
which
cicero
translates
is
a
very
indefinite
and
ambiguous
word
and
it
admits
therefore
of
a
variety
of
applications
it
may
mean
discretion
or
abstinence
or
keeping
a
level
head
courage
is
not
a
virtue
at
all
although
sometimes
it
is
a
servant
or
instrument
of
virtue
but
it
is
just
as
ready
to
become
the
servant
of
the
greatest
villainy
it
is
really
a
quality
of
temperament
even
geulinx
in
the
preface
to
this
condemned
the
platonic
virtues
and
put
the
following
in
their
place
diligence
obedience
justice
and
humility
which
are
obviously
bad
the
chinese
distinguish
five
cardinal
virtues
sympathy
justice
propriety
wisdom
and
sincerity
the
virtues
of
christianity
are
theological
not
cardinal
faith
love
and
hope
fundamental
disposition
towards
others
assuming
the
character
either
of
envy
or
of
sympathy
is
the
point
at
which
the
moral
virtues
and
vices
of
mankind
first
diverge
these
two
diametrically
opposite
qualities
exist
in
every
man
for
they
spring
from
the
inevitable
comparison
which
he
draws
between
his
own
lot
and
that
of
others
according
as
the
result
of
this
comparison
affects
his
individual
character
does
the
one
or
the
other
of
these
qualities
become
the
source
and
principle
of
all
his
action
envy
builds
the
wall
between
and
thicker
and
stronger
sympathy
makes
it
slight
and
transparent
nay
sometimes
it
pulls
down
the
wall
altogether
and
then
the
distinction
between
self
and
vanishes
valour
which
has
been
mentioned
as
a
virtue
or
rather
the
courage
on
which
it
is
based
for
valour
is
only
courage
in
war
deserves
a
closer
examination
the
ancients
reckoned
courage
among
the
virtues
and
cowardice
among
the
vices
but
there
is
no
corresponding
idea
in
the
christian
scheme
which
makes
for
charity
and
patience
and
in
its
teaching
forbids
all
enmity
or
even
resistance
the
result
is
that
with
the
moderns
courage
is
no
longer
a
virtue
nevertheless
it
must
be
admitted
that
cowardice
does
not
seem
to
be
very
compatible
with
any
nobility
of
character
if
only
for
the
reason
that
it
betrays
an
overgreat
apprehension
about
one
own
person
courage
however
may
also
be
explained
as
a
readiness
to
meet
ills
that
threaten
at
the
moment
in
order
to
avoid
greater
ills
that
lie
in
the
future
whereas
cowardice
does
the
contrary
but
this
readiness
is
of
the
same
quality
as
for
patience
consists
in
the
clear
consciousness
that
greater
evils
than
those
which
are
present
and
that
any
violent
attempt
to
flee
from
or
guard
against
the
ills
we
have
may
bring
the
others
upon
us
courage
then
would
be
a
kind
of
patience
and
since
it
is
patience
that
enables
us
to
practise
forbearance
and
self
control
courage
is
through
the
medium
of
patience
at
least
akin
to
virtue
but
perhaps
courage
admits
of
being
considered
from
a
higher
point
of
view
the
fear
of
death
may
in
every
case
be
traced
to
a
deficiency
in
that
natural
philosophy
natural
and
therefore
resting
on
mere
feeling
which
gives
a
man
the
assurance
that
he
exists
in
everything
outside
him
just
as
much
as
in
his
own
person
so
that
the
death
of
his
person
can
do
him
little
harm
but
it
is
just
this
very
assurance
that
would
give
a
man
heroic
courage
and
therefore
as
the
reader
will
recollect
from
my
courage
comes
from
the
same
source
as
the
virtues
of
justice
and
humanity
this
is
i
admit
to
take
a
very
high
view
of
the
matter
but
apart
from
it
i
can
not
well
explain
why
cowardice
seems
contemptible
and
personal
courage
a
noble
and
sublime
thing
for
no
lower
point
of
view
enables
me
to
see
why
a
finite
individual
who
is
everything
to
himself
nay
who
is
himself
even
the
very
fundamental
condition
of
the
existence
of
the
rest
of
the
world
should
not
put
his
own
preservation
above
every
other
aim
it
is
then
an
insufficient
explanation
of
courage
to
make
it
rest
only
on
utility
to
give
it
an
empirical
and
not
a
transcendental
character
it
may
have
been
for
some
such
reason
that
calderon
once
uttered
a
sceptical
but
remarkable
opinion
in
regard
to
courage
nay
actually
denied
its
reality
and
put
his
denial
into
the
mouth
of
a
wise
old
minister
addressing
his
young
sovereign
although
he
observed
natural
fear
is
operative
in
all
alike
a
man
may
be
brave
in
not
letting
it
be
seen
and
it
is
this
that
constitutes
courage

el
natural
temor
en
todos

mostrarle
es
ser

esto
es
lo
que

hija

in
regard
to
the
difference
which
i
have
mentioned
between
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
in
their
estimate
of
courage
as
a
virtue
it
must
be
remembered
that
by
virtue
greek
aretae
the
ancients
understood
every
excellence
or
quality
that
was
praiseworthy
in
itself
it
might
be
moral
or
intellectual
or
possibly
only
physical
but
when
christianity
demonstrated
that
the
fundamental
tendency
of
life
was
moral
it
was
moral
superiority
alone
than
henceforth
attached
to
the
notion
of
virtue
meanwhile
the
earlier
usage
still
survived
in
the
elder
latinists
and
also
in
italian
writers
as
is
proved
by
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
special
attention
of
students
should
be
drawn
to
this
wider
range
of
the
idea
of
virtue
amongst
the
ancients
as
otherwise
it
might
easily
be
a
source
of
secret
perplexity
i
may
recommend
two
passages
preserved
for
us
by
stobaeus
which
will
serve
this
purpose
one
of
them
is
apparently
from
the
pythagorean
philosopher
metopos
in
which
the
fitness
of
every
bodily
member
is
declared
to
be
a
virtue
the
other
pronounces
that
the
virtue
of
a
shoemaker
is
to
make
good
shoes
this
may
also
serve
to
explain
why
it
is
that
in
the
ancient
scheme
of
ethics
virtues
and
vices
are
mentioned
which
find
no
place
in
ours
as
the
place
of
courage
amongst
the
virtues
is
a
matter
of
doubt
so
is
that
of
avarice
amongst
the
vices
it
must
not
however
be
confounded
with
greed
which
is
the
most
immediate
meaning
of
the
latin
word
let
us
then
draw
up
and
examine
the
arguments
et
in
regard
to
avarice
and
leave
the
final
judgment
to
be
formed
by
every
man
for
himself
on
the
one
hand
it
is
argued
that
it
is
not
avarice
which
is
a
vice
but
extravagance
its
opposite
extravagance
springs
from
a
brutish
limitation
to
the
present
moment
in
comparison
with
which
the
future
existing
as
it
does
only
in
thought
is
as
nothing
it
rests
upon
the
illusion
that
sensual
pleasures
possess
a
positive
or
real
value
accordingly
future
need
and
misery
is
the
price
at
which
the
spendthrift
purchases
pleasures
that
are
empty
fleeting
and
often
no
more
than
imaginary
or
else
feeds
his
vain
stupid
on
the
bows
and
scrapes
of
parasites
who
laugh
at
him
in
secret
or
on
the
gaze
of
the
mob
and
those
who
envy
his
magnificence
we
should
therefore
shun
the
spendthrift
as
though
he
had
the
plague
and
on
discovering
his
vice
break
with
him
betimes
in
order
that
later
on
when
the
consequences
of
his
extravagance
ensue
we
may
neither
have
to
help
to
bear
them
nor
on
the
other
hand
have
to
play
the
part
of
the
friends
of
timon
of
athens
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
who
foolishly
squanders
his
own
fortune
will
leave
another
man
intact
if
it
should
chance
to
be
committed
to
his
keeping
nay
and
are
by
sallust
very
rightly
conjoined
hence
it
is
that
extravagance
leads
not
only
to
impoverishment
but
also
to
crime
and
crime
amongst
the
moneyed
classes
is
almost
always
the
result
of
extravagance
it
is
accordingly
with
justice
that
the
declares
all
spendthrifts
to
be
brothers
of
satan
but
it
is
superfluity
that
avarice
brings
in
its
train
and
when
was
superfluity
ever
unwelcome
that
must
be
a
good
vice
which
has
good
consequences
avarice
proceeds
upon
the
principle
that
all
pleasure
is
only
negative
in
its
operation
and
that
the
happiness
which
consists
of
a
series
of
pleasures
is
a
chimaera
that
on
the
contrary
it
is
pains
which
are
positive
and
extremely
real
accordingly
the
avaricious
man
foregoes
the
former
in
order
that
he
may
be
the
better
preserved
from
the
latter
and
thus
it
is
that
and
et
is
his
maxim
and
because
he
knows
further
how
inexhaustible
are
the
possibilities
of
misfortune
and
how
innumerable
the
paths
of
danger
he
increases
the
means
of
avoiding
them
in
order
if
possible
to
surround
himself
with
a
triple
wall
of
protection
who
then
can
say
where
precaution
against
disaster
begins
to
be
exaggerated
he
alone
who
knows
where
the
malignity
of
fate
reaches
its
limit
and
even
if
precaution
were
exaggerated
it
is
an
error
which
at
the
most
would
hurt
the
man
who
took
it
and
not
others
if
he
will
never
need
the
treasures
which
he
lays
up
for
himself
they
will
one
day
benefit
others
whom
nature
has
made
less
careful
that
until
then
he
withdraws
the
money
from
circulation
is
no
misfortune
for
money
is
not
an
article
of
consumption
it
only
represents
the
good
things
which
a
man
may
actually
possess
and
is
not
one
itself
coins
are
only
counters
their
value
is
what
they
represent
and
what
they
represent
can
not
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
moreover
by
holding
back
the
money
the
value
of
the
remainder
which
is
in
circulation
is
enhanced
by
precisely
the
same
amount
even
though
it
be
the
case
as
is
said
that
many
a
miser
comes
in
the
end
to
love
money
itself
for
its
own
sake
it
is
equally
certain
that
many
a
spendthrift
on
the
other
hand
loves
spending
and
squandering
for
no
better
reason
friendship
with
a
miser
is
not
only
without
danger
but
it
is
profitable
because
of
the
great
advantages
it
can
bring
for
it
is
doubtless
those
who
are
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
miser
who
on
his
death
will
reap
the
fruits
of
the
which
he
exercised
but
even
in
his
lifetime
too
something
may
be
expected
of
him
in
cases
of
great
need
at
any
rate
one
can
always
hope
for
more
from
him
than
from
the
spendthrift
who
has
lost
his
all
and
is
himself
helpless
and
in
debt
da
el
duro
que
el
says
a
spanish
proverb
the
man
who
has
a
hard
heart
will
give
more
than
the
man
who
has
an
empty
purse
the
upshot
of
all
this
is
that
avarice
is
not
a
vice
on
the
other
side
it
may
be
said
that
avarice
is
the
quintessence
of
all
vices
when
physical
pleasures
seduce
a
man
from
the
right
path
it
is
his
sensual
nature
the
animal
part
of
him
which
is
at
fault
he
is
carried
away
by
its
attractions
and
overcome
by
the
impression
of
the
moment
he
acts
without
thinking
of
the
consequences
when
on
the
other
hand
he
is
brought
by
age
or
bodily
weakness
to
the
condition
in
which
the
vices
that
he
could
never
abandon
end
by
abandoning
him
and
his
capacity
for
physical
pleasure
dies
if
he
turns
to
avarice
the
intellectual
desire
survives
the
sensual
money
which
represents
all
the
good
things
of
this
world
and
is
these
good
things
in
the
abstract
now
becomes
the
dry
trunk
overgrown
with
all
the
dead
lusts
of
the
flesh
which
are
egoism
in
the
abstract
they
come
to
life
again
in
the
love
of
the
mammon
the
transient
pleasure
of
the
senses
has
become
a
deliberate
and
calculated
lust
of
money
which
like
that
to
which
it
is
directed
is
symbolical
in
its
nature
and
like
it
indestructible
this
obstinate
love
of
the
pleasures
of
the
world
a
love
which
as
it
were
outlives
itself
this
utterly
incorrigible
sin
this
refined
and
sublimated
desire
of
the
flesh
is
the
abstract
form
in
which
all
lusts
are
concentrated
and
to
which
it
stands
like
a
general
idea
to
individual
particulars
accordingly
avarice
is
the
vice
of
age
just
as
extravagance
is
the
vice
of
youth
this
in
utramque
this
debate
for
and
against
is
certainly
calculated
to
drive
us
into
accepting
the
morality
of
aristotle
a
conclusion
that
is
also
supported
by
the
following
consideration
every
human
perfection
is
allied
to
a
defect
into
which
it
threatens
to
pass
but
it
is
also
true
that
every
defect
is
allied
to
a
perfection
hence
it
is
that
if
as
often
happens
we
make
a
mistake
about
a
man
it
is
because
at
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
with
him
we
confound
his
defects
with
the
kinds
of
perfection
to
which
they
are
allied
the
cautious
man
seems
to
us
a
coward
the
economical
man
a
miser
the
spendthrift
seems
liberal
the
rude
fellow
downright
and
sincere
the
foolhardy
person
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
work
with
a
noble
and
so
on
in
many
other
cases
no
one
can
live
among
men
without
feeling
drawn
again
and
again
to
the
tempting
supposition
that
moral
baseness
and
intellectual
incapacity
are
closely
connected
as
though
they
both
sprang
direct
from
one
source
that
that
however
is
not
so
i
have
shown
in
detail
that
it
seems
to
be
so
is
merely
due
to
the
fact
that
both
are
so
often
found
together
and
the
circumstance
is
to
be
explained
by
the
very
frequent
occurrence
of
each
of
them
so
that
it
may
easily
happen
for
both
to
be
compelled
to
live
under
one
roof
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
they
play
into
each
other
hands
to
their
mutual
benefit
and
it
is
this
that
produces
the
very
unedifying
spectacle
which
only
too
many
men
exhibit
and
that
makes
the
world
to
go
as
it
goes
a
man
who
is
unintelligent
is
very
likely
to
show
his
perfidy
villainy
and
malice
whereas
a
clever
man
understands
how
to
conceal
these
qualities
and
how
often
on
the
other
hand
does
a
perversity
of
heart
prevent
a
man
from
seeing
truths
which
his
intelligence
is
quite
capable
of
grasping
footnote

my
chief
work
vol
ch

nevertheless
let
no
one
boast
just
as
every
man
though
he
be
the
greatest
genius
has
very
definite
limitations
in
some
one
sphere
of
knowledge
and
thus
attests
his
common
origin
with
the
essentially
perverse
and
stupid
mass
of
mankind
so
also
has
every
man
something
in
his
nature
which
is
positively
evil
even
the
best
nay
the
noblest
character
will
sometimes
surprise
us
by
isolated
traits
of
depravity
as
though
it
were
to
acknowledge
his
kinship
with
the
human
race
in
which
villainy
nay
cruelty
is
to
be
found
in
that
degree
for
it
was
just
in
virtue
of
this
evil
in
him
this
bad
principle
that
of
necessity
he
became
a
man
and
for
the
same
reason
the
world
in
general
is
what
my
clear
mirror
of
it
has
shown
it
to
be
but
in
spite
of
all
this
the
difference
even
between
one
man
and
another
is
incalculably
great
and
many
a
one
would
be
horrified
to
see
another
as
he
really
is
oh
for
some
asmodeus
of
morality
to
make
not
only
roofs
and
walls
transparent
to
his
favourites
but
also
to
lift
the
veil
of
dissimulation
fraud
hypocrisy
pretence
falsehood
and
deception
which
is
spread
over
all
things
to
show
how
little
true
honesty
there
is
in
the
world
and
how
often
even
where
it
is
least
to
be
expected
behind
all
the
exterior
outwork
of
virtue
secretly
and
in
the
innermost
recesses
unrighteousness
sits
at
the
helm
it
is
just
on
this
account
that
so
many
men
of
the
better
kind
have
friends
for
to
be
sure
how
is
a
man
to
get
relief
from
the
endless
dissimulation
falsity
and
malice
of
mankind
if
there
were
no
dogs
into
whose
honest
faces
he
can
look
without
distrust
for
what
is
our
civilised

a

masquerade
where
you

and
i
do
know
what
all
but
they
are
not
what
they
pretend
to

they
are
only
masks
and
as
a
rule
behind
the
masks
you
will
find
moneymakers
one
man
i
suppose
puts
on
the
mask
of
law
which
he
has
borrowed
for
the
purpose
from
a
barrister
only
in
order
to
be
able
to
give
another
man
a
sound
drubbing
a

chosen

similar

on
the

of
philanthropy

i

what
besides
women
have
a
smaller
choice
as
a
rule
they
avail
themselves
of
the
mask
of

modesty
domesticity
and
humility
then
there
are
general
masks
without
any
particular
character
attaching
to
them
like
dominoes
they
may
be
met
with
everywhere
and
of
this
sort
is
the
strict
rectitude
the
courtesy
the
sincere

smiling
friendship
that

profess

in
this
respect
constitute
any
honest
class
they
are
the
only
people
who
give
themselves
out
to
be
what
they
are
and
therefore
they
go
about
without
any
mask
at
all
and
consequently
take
a
humble
rank
it
is
very
necessary
that
a
man
should
be
apprised
early
in
life
that
it
is
a
masquerade
in
which
he
finds
himself
for
otherwise
there
are
many
things
which
he
will
fail
to
understand
and
put
up
with

at
which
he
will
be
completely
puzzled

men
will
act
like
the
jailer
who
when
he
found
that
his
prisoner
had
performed
the
laborious
task
of
taming
a
spider
and
took
a
pleasure
in
watching
it
immediately
crushed
it
under
his
foot
méchant
par
this
is
why
all
animals
are
instinctively
afraid
of
the
sight
or
even
of
the
track
of
a
man
that
méchant
par
nor
does
their
instinct
them
false
for
it
is
man
alone
who
hunts
game
for
which
he
has
no
use
and
which
does
him
no
harm
it
is
a
fact
then
that
in
the
heart
of
every
man
there
lies
a
wild
beast
which
only
waits
for
an
opportunity
to
storm
and
rage
in
its
desire
to
inflict
pain
on
others
or
if
they
stand
in
his
way
to
kill
them
it
is
this
which
is
the
source
of
all
the
lust
of
war
and
battle
in
trying
to
tame
and
to
some
extent
hold
it
in
check
the
intelligence
its
appointed
keeper
has
always
enough
to
do
people
may
if
they
please
call
it
the
radical
evil
of
human
nature
a
name
which
will
at
least
serve
those
with
whom
a
word
stands
for
an
explanation
i
say
however
that
it
is
the
will
to
live
which
more
and
more
embittered
by
the
constant
sufferings
of
existence
seeks
to
alleviate
its
own
torment
by
causing
torment
in
others
but
in
this
way
a
man
gradually
develops
in
himself
real
cruelty
and
malice
the
observation
may
also
be
added
that
as
according
to
kant
matter
subsists
only
through
the
antagonism
of
the
powers
of
expansion
and
contraction
so
human
society
subsists
only
by
the
antagonism
of
hatred
or
anger
and
fear
for
there
is
a
moment
in
the
life
of
all
of
us
when
the
malignity
of
our
nature
might
perhaps
make
us
murderers
if
it
were
not
accompanied
by
a
due
admixture
of
fear
to
keep
it
within
bounds
and
this
fear
again
would
make
a
man
the
sport
and
laughing
stock
of
every
boy
if
anger
were
not
lying
ready
in
him
and
keeping
watch
but
it
is
a
mischievous
delight
in
the
misfortunes
of
others
which
remains
the
worst
trait
in
human
nature
it
is
a
feeling
which
is
closely
akin
to
cruelty
and
differs
from
it
to
say
the
truth
only
as
theory
from
practice
in
general
it
may
be
said
of
it
that
it
takes
the
place
which
pity
ought
to
take
pity
which
is
its
opposite
and
the
true
source
of
all
real
justice
and
charity
is
also
opposed
to
pity
but
in
another
sense
envy
that
is
to
say
is
produced
by
a
cause
directly
antagonistic
to
that
which
produces
the
delight
in
mischief
the
opposition
between
pity
and
envy
on
the
one
hand
and
pity
and
the
delight
in
mischief
on
the
other
rests
in
the
main
on
the
occasions
which
call
them
forth
in
the
case
of
envy
it
is
only
as
a
direct
effect
of
the
cause
which
excites
it
that
we
feel
it
at
all
that
is
just
the
reason
why
envy
although
it
is
a
reprehensible
feeling
still
admits
of
some
excuse
and
is
in
general
a
very
human
quality
whereas
the
delight
in
mischief
is
diabolical
and
its
taunts
are
the
laughter
of
hell
the
delight
in
mischief
as
i
have
said
takes
the
place
which
pity
ought
to
take
envy
on
the
contrary
finds
a
place
only
where
there
is
no
inducement
to
pity
or
rather
an
inducement
to
its
opposite
and
it
is
just
as
this
opposite
that
envy
arises
in
the
human
breast
and
so
far
therefore
it
may
still
be
reckoned
a
human
sentiment
nay
i
am
afraid
that
no
one
will
be
found
to
be
entirely
free
from
it
for
that
a
man
should
feel
his
own
lack
of
things
more
bitterly
at
the
sight
of
another
delight
in
the
enjoyment
of
them
is
natural
nay
it
is
inevitable
but
this
should
not
rouse
his
hatred
of
the
man
who
is
happier
than
himself
it
is
just
this
hatred
however
in
which
true
envy
consists
least
of
all
should
a
man
be
envious
when
it
is
a
question
not
of
the
gifts
of
fortune
or
chance
or
another
favour
but
of
the
gifts
of
nature
because
everything
that
is
innate
in
a
man
rests
on
a
metaphysical
basis
and
possesses
justification
of
a
higher
kind
it
is
so
to
speak
given
him
by
divine
grace
but
unhappily
it
is
just
in
the
case
of
personal
advantages
that
envy
is
most
irreconcilable
thus
it
is
that
intelligence
or
even
genius
can
not
get
on
in
the
world
without
begging
pardon
for
its
existence
wherever
it
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
able
proudly
and
boldly
to
despise
the
world
in
other
words
if
envy
is
aroused
only
by
wealth
rank
or
power
it
is
often
kept
down
by
egoism
which
perceives
that
on
occasion
assistance
enjoyment
support
protection
advancement
and
so
on
may
be
hoped
for
from
the
object
of
envy
or
that
at
least
by
intercourse
with
him
a
man
may
himself
win
honour
from
the
reflected
light
of
his
superiority
and
here
too
there
is
the
hope
of
one
day
attaining
all
those
advantages
himself
on
the
other
hand
in
the
envy
that
is
directed
to
natural
gifts
and
personal
advantages
like
beauty
in
women
or
intelligence
in
men
there
is
no
consolation
or
hope
of
one
kind
or
the
other
so
that
nothing
remains
but
to
indulge
a
bitter
and
irreconcilable
hatred
of
the
person
who
possesses
these
privileges
and
hence
the
only
remaining
desire
is
to
take
vengeance
on
him
but
here
the
envious
man
finds
himself
in
an
unfortunate
position
for
all
his
blows
fall
powerless
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
they
come
from
him
accordingly
he
hides
his
feelings
as
carefully
as
if
they
were
secret
sins
and
so
becomes
an
inexhaustible
inventor
of
tricks
and
artifices
and
devices
for
concealing
and
masking
his
procedure
in
order
that
unperceived
he
may
wound
the
object
of
his
envy
for
instance
with
an
air
of
the
utmost
unconcern
he
will
ignore
the
advantages
which
are
eating
his
heart
out
he
will
neither
see
them
nor
know
them
nor
have
observed
or
even
heard
of
them
and
thus
make
himself
a
master
in
the
art
of
dissimulation
with
great
cunning
he
will
completely
overlook
the
man
whose
brilliant
qualities
are
gnawing
at
his
heart
and
act
as
though
he
were
quite
an
unimportant
person
he
will
take
no
notice
of
him
and
on
occasion
will
have
even
quite
forgotten
his
existence
but
at
the
same
time
he
will
before
all
things
endeavour
by
secret
machination
carefully
to
deprive
those
advantages
of
any
opportunity
of
showing
themselves
and
becoming
known
then
out
of
his
dark
corner
he
will
attack
these
qualities
with
censure
mockery
ridicule
and
calumny
like
the
toad
which
spurts
its
poison
from
a
hole
no
less
will
he
enthusiastically
praise
unimportant
people
or
even
indifferent
or
bad
performances
in
the
same
sphere
in
short
he
will
becomes
a
proteas
in
stratagem
in
order
to
wound
others
without
showing
himself
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
the
trained
eye
recognises
him
in
spite
of
it
all
he
betrays
himself
if
by
nothing
else
by
the
way
in
which
he
timidly
avoids
and
flies
from
the
object
of
his
envy
who
stands
the
more
completely
alone
the
more
brilliant
he
is
and
this
is
the
reason
why
pretty
girls
have
no
friends
of
their
own
sex
he
betrays
himself
too
by
the
causeless
hatred
which
he
shows
a
hatred
which
finds
vent
in
a
violent
explosion
at
any
circumstance
however
trivial
though
it
is
often
only
the
product
of
his
imagination
how
many
such
men
there
are
in
the
world
may
be
recognised
by
the
universal
praise
of
modesty
that
is
of
a
virtue
invented
on
behalf
of
dull
and
commonplace
people
nevertheless
it
is
a
virtue
which
by
exhibiting
the
necessity
for
dealing
considerately
with
the
wretched
plight
of
these
people
is
just
what
calls
attention
to
it
for
our
and
our
pride
there
can
be
nothing
more
flattering
than
the
sight
of
envy
lurking
in
its
retreat
and
plotting
its
schemes
but
never
let
a
man
forget
that
where
there
is
envy
there
is
hatred
and
let
him
be
careful
not
to
make
a
false
friend
out
of
any
envious
person
therefore
it
is
important
to
our
safety
to
lay
envy
bare
and
a
man
should
study
to
discover
its
tricks
as
it
is
everywhere
to
be
found
and
always
goes
about
or
as
i
have
said
like
a
venomous
toad
it
lurks
in
dark
corners
it
deserves
neither
quarter
nor
sympathy
but
as
we
can
never
reconcile
it
let
our
rule
of
conduct
be
to
scorn
it
with
a
good
heart
and
as
our
happiness
and
glory
is
torture
to
it
we
may
rejoice
in
its
sufferings
neid
wirst
nimmer
du
versöhnen
so
magst
du
ihn
getrost
verhöhnen
dein
glück
dein
ruhm
ist
ihm
ein
leiden
magst
drum
an
seiner
quaal
dich
we
have
been
taking
a
look
at
the
of
man
and
it
is
a
sight
which
may
well
fill
us
with
horror
but
now
we
must
cast
our
eyes
on
the
of
his
existence
and
when
we
have
done
so
and
are
horrified
by
that
too
we
must
look
back
again
at
his
depravity
we
shall
then
find
that
they
hold
the
balance
to
each
other
we
shall
perceive
the
eternal
justice
of
things
for
we
shall
recognise
that
the
world
is
itself
the
last
judgment
on
it
and
we
shall
begin
to
understand
why
it
is
that
everything
that
lives
must
pay
the
penalty
of
its
existence
first
in
living
and
then
in
dying
thus
the
evil
of
the
penalty
accords
with
the
evil
of
the
sin
with
from
the
same
point
of
view
we
lose
our
indignation
at
that
intellectual
incapacity
of
the
great
majority
of
mankind
which
in
life
so
often
disgusts
us
in
this
as
the
buddhists
call
it
human
misery
human
depravity
and
human
folly
correspond
with
one
another
perfectly
and
they
are
of
like
magnitude
but
if
on
some
special
inducement
we
direct
our
gaze
to
one
of
them
and
survey
it
in
particular
it
seems
to
exceed
the
other
two
this
however
is
an
illusion
and
merely
the
effect
of
their
colossal
range
all
things
proclaim
this
more
than
all
else
the
world
of
mankind
in
which
from
a
moral
point
of
view
villainy
and
baseness
and
from
an
intellectual
point
of
view
incapacity
and
stupidity
prevail
to
a
horrifying
extent
nevertheless
there
appear
in
it
although
very
spasmodically
and
always
as
a
fresh
surprise
manifestations
of
honesty
of
goodness
nay
even
of
nobility
and
also
of
great
intelligence
of
the
thinking
mind
of
genius
they
never
quite
vanish
but
like
single
points
of
light
gleam
upon
us
out
of
the
great
dark
mass
we
must
accept
them
as
a
pledge
that
this
contains
a
good
and
redeeming
principle
which
is
capable
of
breaking
through
and
of
filling
and
freeing
the
whole
of
it
the
readers
of
my
know
that
with
me
the
ultimate
foundation
of
morality
is
the
truth
which
in
the
and
the
receives
its
expression
in
the
established
mystical
formula
twam
asi
this
is
which
is
spoken
with
reference
to
every
living
thing
be
it
man
or
beast
and
is
called
the
the
great
word
actions
which
proceed
in
accordance
with
this
principle
such
as
those
of
the
philanthropist
may
indeed
be
regarded
as
the
beginning
of
mysticism
every
benefit
rendered
with
a
pure
intention
proclaims
that
the
man
who
exercises
it
acts
in
direct
conflict
with
the
world
of
appearance
for
he
recognises
himself
as
identical
with
another
individual
who
exists
in
complete
separation
from
him
accordingly
all
disinterested
kindness
is
inexplicable
it
is
a
mystery
and
hence
in
order
to
explain
it
a
man
has
to
resort
to
all
sorts
of
fictions
when
kant
had
demolished
all
other
arguments
for
theism
he
admitted
one
only
that
it
gave
the
best
interpretation
and
solution
of
such
mysterious
actions
and
of
all
others
like
them
he
therefore
allowed
it
to
stand
as
a
presumption
unsusceptible
indeed
of
theoretical
proof
but
valid
from
a
practical
point
of
view
i
may
however
express
my
doubts
whether
he
was
quite
serious
about
it
for
to
make
morality
rest
on
theism
is
really
to
reduce
morality
to
egoism
although
the
english
it
is
true
as
also
the
lowest
classes
of
society
with
us
do
not
perceive
the
possibility
of
any
other
foundation
for
it
the
recognition
of
a
man
own
true
being
in
another
individual
objectively
presented
to
him
is
exhibited
in
a
particularly
beautiful
and
clear
way
in
the
cases
in
which
a
man
already
destined
to
death
beyond
any
hope
of
rescue
gives
himself
up
to
the
welfare
of
others
with
great
solicitude
and
zeal
and
tries
to
save
them
of
this
kind
is
the
story
of
a
servant
who
was
bitten
in
a
courtyard
at
night
by
a
mad
dog
in
the
belief
that
she
was
beyond
hope
she
seized
the
dog
and
dragged
it
into
a
stable
which
she
then
locked
so
that
no
one
else
might
be
bitten
then
again
there
is
the
incident
in
naples
which
tischbein
has
immortalised
in
one
of
his
a
son
fleeing
from
the
lava
which
is
rapidly
streaming
toward
the
sea
is
carrying
his
aged
father
on
his
back
when
there
is
only
a
narrow
strip
of
land
left
between
the
devouring
elements
the
father
bids
the
son
put
him
down
so
that
the
son
may
save
himself
by
flight
as
otherwise
both
will
be
lost
the
son
obeys
and
as
he
goes
casts
a
glance
of
farewell
on
his
father
this
is
the
moment
depicted
the
historical
circumstance
which
scott
represents
in
his
masterly
way
in
heart
of
chap
is
of
a
precisely
similar
kind
where
of
two
delinquents
condemned
to
death
the
one
who
by
his
awkwardness
caused
the
capture
of
the
other
happily
sets
him
free
in
the
chapel
by
overpowering
the
guard
after
the
without
at
the
same
time
making
any
attempt
on
his
own
behalf
nay
in
the
same
category
must
also
be
placed
the
scene
which
is
represented
in
a
common
engraving
which
may
perhaps
be
objectionable
to
western
readers
i
mean
the
one
in
which
a
soldier
kneeling
to
be
shot
is
trying
by
waving
a
cloth
to
frighten
away
his
dog
who
wants
to
come
to
him
in
all
these
cases
we
see
an
individual
in
the
face
of
his
own
immediate
and
certain
destruction
no
longer
thinking
of
saving
himself
so
that
he
may
direct
the
whole
of
his
efforts
to
saving
some
one
else
how
could
there
be
a
clearer
expression
of
the
consciousness
that
what
is
being
destroyed
is
only
a
phenomenon
and
that
the
destruction
itself
is
only
a
phenomenon
that
on
the
other
hand
the
real
being
of
the
man
who
meets
his
death
is
untouched
by
that
event
and
lives
on
in
the
other
man
in
whom
even
now
as
his
action
betrays
he
so
clearly
perceives
it
to
exist
for
if
this
were
not
so
and
it
was
his
real
being
which
was
about
to
be
annihilated
how
could
that
being
spend
its
last
efforts
in
showing
such
an
ardent
sympathy
in
the
welfare
and
continued
existence
of
another
there
are
two
different
ways
in
which
a
man
may
become
conscious
of
his
own
existence
on
the
one
hand
he
may
have
an
empirical
perception
of
it
as
it
manifests
itself
externally
something
so
small
that
it
approaches
vanishing
point
set
in
a
world
which
as
regards
time
and
space
is
infinite
one
only
of
the
thousand
millions
of
human
creatures
who
run
about
on
this
planet
for
a
very
brief
period
and
are
renewed
every
thirty
years
on
the
other
hand
by
going
down
into
the
depths
of
his
own
nature
a
man
may
become
conscious
that
he
is
all
in
all
that
in
fact
he
is
the
only
real
being
and
that
in
addition
this
real
being
perceives
itself
again
in
others
who
present
themselves
from
without
as
though
they
formed
a
mirror
of
himself
of
these
two
ways
in
which
a
man
may
come
to
know
what
he
is
the
first
grasps
the
phenomenon
alone
the
mere
product
of
principle
of
whereas
the
second
makes
a
man
immediately
conscious
that
he
is
this
is
a
doctrine
in
which
as
regards
the
first
way
i
have
kant
and
as
regards
both
i
have
the
to
support
me
there
is
it
is
true
a
simple
objection
to
the
second
method
it
may
be
said
to
assume
that
one
and
the
same
being
can
exist
in
different
places
at
the
same
time
and
yet
be
complete
in
each
of
them
although
from
an
empirical
point
of
view
this
is
the
most
palpable
impossibility
nay
absurdity
it
is
nevertheless
perfectly
true
of
the
the
impossibility
and
the
absurdity
of
it
empirically
are
only
due
to
the
forms
which
phenomena
assume
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
individuation
for
the
the
will
to
live
exists
whole
and
undivided
in
every
being
even
in
the
smallest
as
completely
as
in
the
of
all
things
that
ever
were
or
are
or
will
be
this
is
why
every
being
even
the
smallest
says
to
itself
so
long
as
i
am
safe
let
the
world
perish
ego
salvus
sim
pereat
and
in
truth
even
if
only
one
individual
were
left
in
the
world
and
all
the
rest
were
to
perish
the
one
that
remained
would
still
possess
the
whole
of
the
world
uninjured
and
undiminished
and
would
laugh
at
the
destruction
of
the
world
as
an
illusion
this
conclusion
may
be
balanced
by
the
which
is
on
all
fours
with
it
that
if
that
last
individual
were
to
be
annihilated
in
and
with
him
the
whole
world
would
be
destroyed
it
was
in
this
sense
that
the
mystic
angelas
silesius
declared
that
god
could
not
live
for
a
moment
without
him
and
that
if
he
were
to
be
annihilated
god
must
of
necessity
give
up
the
ghost

see
and
note
but
the
empirical
point
of
view
also
to
some
extent
enables
us
to
perceive
that
it
is
true
or
at
least
possible
that
our
self
can
exist
in
other
beings
whose
consciousness
is
separated
and
different
from
our
own
that
this
is
so
is
shown
by
the
experience
of
somnambulists
although
the
identity
of
their
ego
is
preserved
throughout
they
know
nothing
when
they
awake
of
all
that
a
moment
before
they
themselves
said
did
or
suffered
so
entirely
is
the
individual
consciousness
a
phenomenon
that
even
in
the
same
ego
two
consciousnesses
can
arise
of
which
the
one
knows
nothing
of
the
other
government
it
is
a
characteristic
failing
of
the
germans
to
look
in
the
clouds
for
what
lies
at
their
feet
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
treatment
which
the
idea
of
has
received
at
the
hands
of
professors
of
philosophy
when
they
are
called
upon
to
explain
those
simple
relations
of
human
life
which
make
up
the
substance
of
this
right
such
as
right
and
wrong
property
state
punishment
and
so
on
they
have
recourse
to
the
most
extravagant
abstract
remote
and
meaningless
conceptions
and
out
of
them
build
a
tower
of
babel
reaching
to
the
clouds
and
taking
this
or
that
form
according
to
the
special
whim
of
the
professor
for
the
time
being
the
clearest
and
simplest
relations
of
life
such
as
affect
us
directly
are
thus
made
quite
unintelligible
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
young
people
who
are
educated
in
such
a
school
these
relations
themselves
are
perfectly
simple
and
easily
understood
as
the
reader
may
convince
himself
if
he
will
turn
to
the
account
which
i
have
given
of
them
in
the
of
and
in
my
chief
work
bk
but
at
the
sound
of
certain
words
like
right
freedom
the
good
being
this
nugatory
infinitive
of
the
cupola
and
many
others
of
the
same
sort
the
german
head
begins
to
swim
and
falling
straightway
into
a
kind
of
delirium
he
launches
forth
into
phrases
which
have
no
meaning
whatever
he
takes
the
most
remote
and
empty
conceptions
and
strings
them
together
artificially
instead
of
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
facts
and
looking
at
things
and
relations
as
they
really
are
it
is
these
things
and
relations
which
supply
the
ideas
of
right
and
freedom
and
give
them
the
only
true
meaning
that
they
possess
the
man
who
starts
from
the
preconceived
opinion
that
the
conception
of
right
must
be
a
positive
one
and
then
attempts
to
define
it
will
fail
for
he
is
trying
to
grasp
a
shadow
to
pursue
a
spectre
to
search
for
what
does
not
exist
the
conception
of
right
is
a
negative
one
like
the
conception
of
freedom
its
content
is
mere
negation
it
is
the
conception
of
wrong
which
is
positive
wrong
has
the
same
significance
as
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
term
an
injury
may
be
done
either
to
a
man
person
or
to
his
property
or
to
his
honour
and
accordingly
a
man
rights
are
easy
to
define
every
one
has
a
right
to
do
anything
that
injures
no
one
else
to
have
a
right
to
do
or
claim
a
thing
means
nothing
more
than
to
be
able
to
do
or
take
or
vise
it
without
thereby
injuring
any
one
else
sigillum
this
definition
shows
how
senseless
many
questions
are
for
instance
the
question
whether
we
have
the
right
to
take
our
own
life
as
far
as
concerns
the
personal
claims
which
others
may
possibly
have
upon
us
they
are
subject
to
the
condition
that
we
are
alive
and
fall
to
the
ground
when
we
die
to
demand
of
a
man
who
does
not
care
to
live
any
longer
for
himself
that
he
should
live
on
as
a
mere
machine
for
the
advantage
of
others
is
an
extravagant
pretension
although
men
powers
differ
their
rights
are
alike
their
rights
do
not
rest
upon
their
powers
because
right
is
of
a
moral
complexion
they
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
same
will
to
live
shows
itself
in
every
man
at
the
same
stage
of
its
manifestation
this
however
only
applies
to
that
original
and
abstract
right
which
a
man
possesses
as
a
man
the
property
and
also
the
honour
which
a
man
acquires
for
himself
by
the
exercise
of
his
powers
depend
on
the
measure
and
kind
of
power
which
he
possesses
and
so
lend
his
right
a
wider
sphere
of
application
here
then
equality
comes
to
an
end
the
man
who
is
better
equipped
or
more
active
increases
by
adding
to
his
gains
not
his
right
but
the
number
of
the
things
to
which
it
extends
in
my
chief
work
i
have
proved
that
the
state
in
its
essence
is
merely
an
institution
existing
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
its
members
against
outward
attack
or
inward
dissension
it
follows
from
this
that
the
ultimate
ground
on
which
the
state
is
necessary
is
the
acknowledged
lack
of
right
in
the
human
race
if
right
were
there
no
one
would
think
of
a
state
for
no
one
would
have
any
fear
that
his
rights
would
be
impaired
and
a
mere
union
against
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
or
the
elements
would
have
very
little
analogy
with
what
we
mean
by
a
state
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
easy
to
see
how
dull
and
stupid
are
the
philosophasters
who
in
pompous
phrases
represent
that
the
state
is
the
supreme
end
and
flower
of
human
existence
such
a
view
is
the
apotheosis
of
philistinism

if
it
were

a

would

done
enough
in
building
his

would
need
no
other
protection
than
the
right
of
possessing
it
which
would

since
wrong

particularly
in
a
passage
in

now
this
is
a
conception
of
right
which
both
in
theory
and
in
practice
no
longer
prevails
in
the
civic
world
but
in
the
world
in
general
though
abolished

it
continues
to

state
and
has
to
pay
the
penalty
of
having
cultivated
only
the
arts
of
peace
and
ignored
the
arts
of
war
there
is
a
certain
analogy
between
the
operations
of
nature
and
those
of
man
which
is
a
peculiar
but
not
fortuitous
character
and
is
based
on
the
identity
of
the
will
in
both
when
the
herbivorous
animals
had
taken
their
place
in
the
organic
world
beasts
of
prey
made
their
appearance
necessarily
a
late
appearance
in
each
species
and
proceeded
to
live
upon
them
just
in
the
same
way
as
soon
as
by
honest
toil
and
in
the
sweat
of
their
faces
men
have
won
from
the
ground
what
is
needed
for
the
support
of
their
societies
a
number
of
individuals
are
sure
to
arise
in
some
of
these
societies
who
instead
of
cultivating
the
earth
and
living
on
its
produce
prefer
to
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
risk
health
and
freedom
by
falling
upon
those
who
are
in
possession
of
what
they
have
honestly
earned
and
by
appropriating
the
fruits
of
their
labour
these
are
the
beasts
of
prey
in
the
human
race
they
are
the
conquering
peoples
whom
we
find
everywhere
in
history
from
the
most
ancient
to
the
most
recent
times
their
varying
fortunes
as
at
one
moment
they
succeed
and
at
another
fail
make
up
the
general
elements
of
the
history
of
the
world
hence
voltaire
was
perfectly
right
when
he
said
that
the
aim
of
all
war
is
robbery
that
those
who
engage
in
it
are
ashamed
of
their
doings
is
clear
by
the
fact
that
governments
loudly
protest
their
reluctance
to
appeal
to
arms
except
for
purposes
of
instead
of
trying
to
excuse
themselves
by
telling
public
and
official
lies
which
are
almost
more
revolting
than
war
itself
they
should
take
their
stand
as
bold
as
brass
on
macchiavelli
doctrine
the
gist
of
it
may
be
stated
to
be
this
that
whereas
between
one
individual
and
another
and
so
far
as
concerns
the
law
and
morality
of
their
relations
the
principle
do
to
others
what
you
would
like
done
to
certainly
applies
it
is
the
converse
of
this
principle
which
is
appropriate
in
the
case
of
nations
and
in
politics
you
would
like
done
to
yourself
do
to
if
you
do
not
want
to
be
put
under
a
foreign
yoke
take
time
by
the
forelock
and
put
your
neighbour
under
it
himself
whenever
that
is
to
say
his
weakness
offers
you
the
opportunity
for
if
you
let
the
opportunity
pass
it
will
desert
one
day
to
the
enemy
camp
and
offer
itself
there
then
your
enemy
will
put
you
under
his
yoke
and
your
failure
to
grasp
the
opportunity
may
be
paid
for
not
by
the
generation
which
was
guilty
of
it
but
by
the
next
this
macchiavellian
principle
is
always
a
much
more
decent
cloak
for
the
lust
of
robbery
than
the
rags
of
very
obvious
lies
in
a
speech
from
the
head
of
the
state
lies
too
of
a
description
which
recalls
the
story
of
the
rabbit
attacking
the
dog
every
state
looks
upon
its
neighbours
as
at
bottom
a
horde
of
robbers
who
will
fall
upon
it
as
soon
as
they
have
the
opportunity
between
the
serf
the
farmer
the
tenant
and
the
mortgagee
the
difference
is
rather
one
of
form
than
of
substance
whether
the
peasant
belongs
to
me
or
the
land
on
which
he
has
to
get
a
living
whether
the
bird
is
mine
or
its
food
the
tree
or
its
fruit
is
a
matter
of
little
moment
for
as
shakespeare
makes
shylock
say
take
my
life
when
you
do
take
the
means
whereby
i
the
free
peasant
has
indeed
the
advantage
that
he
can
go
off
and
seek
his
fortune
in
the
wide
world
whereas
the
serf
who
is
attached
to
the
soil
has
an
advantage
which
is
perhaps
still
greater
that
when
failure
of
crops
or
illness
old
age
or
incapacity
render
him
helpless
his
master
must
look
after
him
and
so
he
sleeps
well
at
night
whereas
if
the
crops
fail
his
master
tosses
about
on
his
bed
trying
to
think
how
he
is
to
procure
bread
for
his
men
as
long
ago
as
menander
it
was
said
that
it
is
better
to
be
the
slave
of
a
good
master
than
to
live
miserably
as
a
freeman
another
advantage
possessed
by
the
free
is
that
if
they
have
any
talents
they
can
improve
their
position
but
the
same
advantage
is
not
wholly
withheld
from
the
slave
if
he
proves
himself
useful
to
his
master
by
the
exercise
of
any
skill
he
is
treated
accordingly
just
as
in
ancient
rome
mechanics
foremen
of
workshops
architects
nay
even
doctors
were
generally
slaves
slavery
and
poverty
then
are
only
two
forms
i
might
almost
say
only
two
names
of
the
same
thing
the
essence
of
which
is
that
a
physical
powers
are
employed
in
the
main
not
for
himself
but
for
others
and
this
leads
partly
to
his
being
with
work
and
partly
to
his
getting
a
scanty
satisfaction
for
his
needs
for
nature
has
given
a
man
only
as
much
physical
power
as
will
suffice
if
he
exerts
it
in
moderation
to
gain
a
sustenance
from
the
earth
no
great
superfluity
of
power
is
his
if
then
a
not
inconsiderable
number
of
men
are
relieved
from
the
common
burden
of
sustaining
the
existence
of
the
human
race
the
burden
of
the
remainder
is
augmented
and
they
suffer
this
is
the
chief
source
of
the
evil
which
under
the
name
of
slavery
or
under
the
name
of
the
proletariat
has
always
oppressed
the
great
majority
of
the
human
race
but
the
more
remote
cause
of
it
is
luxury
in
order
it
may
be
said
that
some
few
persons
may
have
what
is
unnecessary
superfluous
and
the
product
of
refinement
nay
in
order
that
they
may
satisfy
artificial
needs
a
great
part
of
the
existing
powers
of
mankind
has
to
be
devoted
to
this
object
and
therefore
withdrawn
from
the
production
of
what
is
necessary
and
indispensable
instead
of
building
cottages
for
themselves
thousands
of
men
build
mansions
for
a
few
instead
of
weaving
coarse
materials
for
themselves
and
their
families
they
make
fine
cloths
silk
or
even
lace
for
the
rich
and
in
general
manufacture
a
thousand
objects
of
luxury
for
their
pleasure
a
great
part
of
the
urban
population
consists
of
workmen
who
make
these
articles
of
luxury
and
for
them
and
those
who
give
them
work
the
peasants
have
to
plough
and
sow
and
look
after
the
flocks
as
well
as
for
themselves
and
thus
have
more
labour
than
nature
originally
imposed
upon
them
moreover
the
urban
population
devotes
a
great
deal
of
physical
strength
and
a
great
deal
of
land
to
such
things
as
wine
silk
tobacco
hops
asparagus
and
so
on
instead
of
to
corn
potatoes
and
further
a
number
of
men
are
withdrawn
from
agriculture
and
employed
in
and
seafaring
in
order
that
sugar
coffee
tea
and
other
goods
may
be
imported
in
short
a
large
part
of
the
powers
of
the
human
race
is
taken
away
from
the
production
of
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
bring
what
is
superfluous
and
unnecessary
within
the
reach
of
a
few
as
long
therefore
as
luxury
exists
there
must
be
a
corresponding
amount
of
and
misery
whether
it
takes
the
name
of
poverty
or
of
slavery
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
is
that
slavery
originates
in
violence
and
poverty
in
craft
the
whole
unnatural
condition
of
society
the
universal
struggle
to
escape
from
misery
the
attended
with
so
much
loss
of
life
the
complicated
interests
of
commerce
and
finally
the
wars
to
which
it
all
gives
rise
is
due
only
and
alone
to
luxury
which
gives
no
happiness
even
to
those
who
enjoy
it
nay
makes
them
ill
and
accordingly
it
looks
as
if
the
most
effective
way
of
alleviating
human
misery
would
be
to
diminish
luxury
or
even
abolish
it
altogether
there
is
unquestionably
much
truth
in
this
train
of
thought
but
the
conclusion
at
which
it
arrives
is
refuted
by
an
argument
possessing
this
advantage
over
it
that
it
is
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
experience
a
certain
amount
of
work
is
devoted
to
purposes
of
luxury
what
the
human
race
loses
in
this
way
in
the
which
would
otherwise
be
available
for
the
necessities
of
existence
is
gradually
made
up
to
it
a
thousandfold
by
the
which
in
a
chemical
sense
is
thereby
released
and
since
the
intelligence
and
sensibility
which
are
thus
promoted
are
on
a
higher
level
than
the
muscular
irritability
which
they
supplant
so
the
achievements
of
mind
exceed
those
of
the
body
a
thousandfold
one
wise
counsel
is
worth
the
work
of
many
hands

a
nation
of
nothing
but
peasants
would
do
little
in
the
way
of
discovery
and
invention
but
idle
hands
make
active
heads
science
and
the
arts
are
themselves
the
children
of
luxury
and
they
discharge
their
debt
to
it
the
work
which
they
do
is
to
perfect
technology
in
all
its
branches
mechanical
chemical
and
physical
an
art
which
in
our
days
has
brought
machinery
to
a
pitch
never
dreamt
of
before
and
in
particular
has
by
steam
and
electricity
accomplished
things
the
like
of
which
would
in
earlier
ages
have
been
ascribed
to
the
agency
of
the
devil
in
manufactures
of
all
kinds
and
to
some
extent
in
agriculture
machines
now
do
a
thousand
times
more
than
could
ever
have
been
done
by
the
hands
of
all
the
educated
and
professional
classes
and
could
ever
have
been
attained
if
all
luxury
had
been
abolished
and
every
one
had
returned
to
the
life
of
a
peasant
it
is
by
no
means
the
rich
alone
but
all
classes
who
derive
benefit
from
these
industries
things
which
in
former
days
hardly
any
one
could
afford
are
now
cheap
and
abundant
and
even
the
lowest
classes
are
much
better

in

in

a
king
of
england
once
borrowed
a

of
silk
stockings
from
one
of
his
lords
so
that
he
might
wear
them
in
giving
an
audience
to
the
french
ambassador
even
queen
elizabeth
was
greatly
pleased
and
astonished
to
receive
a
pair
as
a
new
year
present
every
shopman
has
them
fifty
years
ago
ladies
wore
the
kind
of
calico
gowns
which
servants
wear
now
if
mechanical
science
continues
to
progress
at
the
same
rate
for
any
length
of
time
it
may
end
by
saving
human
labour
almost
entirely
just
as
horses
are
even
now
being
largely
superseded
by
machines
for
it
is
possible
to
conceive
that
intellectual
culture
might
in
some
degree
become
general
in
the
human
race
and
this
would
be
impossible
as
long
as
bodily
labour
was
incumbent
on
any
great
part
of
it
muscular
irritability
and
nervous
sensibility
are
always
and
everywhere
both
generally
and
particularly
in
antagonism
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
is
one
and
the
same
vital
power
which
underlies
both
further
since
the
arts
have
a
softening
effect
on
character
it
is
possible
that
quarrels
great
and
small
wars
and
duels
will
vanish
from
the
world
just
as
both
have
become
much
rarer
occurrences
however
it
is
not
my
object
here
to
write
a
but
apart
from
all
this
the
arguments
used
above
in
favour
of
the
abolition
of
luxury
and
the
uniform
distribution
of
all
bodily
labour
are
open
to
the
objection
that
the
great
mass
of
mankind
always
and
everywhere
can
not
do
without
leaders
guides
and
counsellors
in
one
shape
or
another
according
to
the
matter
in
question
judges
governors
generals
officials
priests
doctors
men
of
learning
philosophers
and
so
on
are
all
a
necessity
their
common
task
is
to
lead
the
race
for
the
greater
part
so
incapable
and
perverse
through
the
labyrinth
of
life
of
which
each
of
them
according
to
his
position
and
capacity
has
obtained
a
general
view
be
his
range
wide
or
narrow
that
these
guides
of
the
race
should
be
permanently
relieved
of
all
bodily
labour
as
well
as
of
all
vulgar
need
and
discomfort
nay
that
in
proportion
to
their
much
greater
achievements
they
should
necessarily
own
and
enjoy
more
than
the
common
man
is
natural
and
reasonable
great
merchants
should
also
be
included
in
the
same
privileged
class
whenever
they
make
preparations
for
national
needs
the
question
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
at
bottom
the
same
as
the
question
whether
any
man
can
have
an
original
right
to
rule
a
people
against
its
will
how
that
proposition
can
be
reasonably
maintained
i
do
not
see
the
people
it
must
be
admitted
is
sovereign
but
it
is
a
sovereign
who
is
always
a
minor
it
must
have
permanent
guardians
and
it
can
never
exercise
its
rights
itself
without
creating
dangers
of
which
no
one
can
foresee
the
end
especially
as
like
all
minors
it
is
very
apt
to
become
the
sport
of
designing
sharpers
in
the
shape
of
what
are
called
demagogues
voltaire
remarks
that
the
first
man
to
become
a
king
was
a
successful
soldier
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
all
princes
were
originally
victorious
leaders
of
armies
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
as
such
that
they
bore
sway
on
the
rise
of
standing
armies
princes
began
to
regard
their
people
as
a
means
of
sustaining
themselves
and
their
soldiers
and
treated
them
accordingly
as
though
they
were
a
herd
of
cattle
which
had
to
be
tended
in
order
that
it
might
provide
wool
milk
and
meat
the
why
and
wherefore
of
all
this
as
i
shall
presently
show
in
detail
is
the
fact
that
originally
it
was
not
right
but
might
that
ruled
in
the
world
might
has
the
advantage
of
having
been
the
first
in
the
field
that
is
why
it
is
impossible
to
do
away
with
it
and
abolish
it
altogether
it
must
always
have
its
place
and
all
that
a
man
can
wish
or
ask
is
that
it
should
be
found
on
the
side
of
right
and
associated
with
it
accordingly
says
the
prince
to
his
subjects
i
rule
you
in
virtue
of
the
power
which
i
possess
but
on
the
other
hand
it
excludes
that
of
any
one
else
and
i
shall
suffer
none
but
my
own
whether
it
comes
from
without
or
arises
within
by
one
of
you
trying
to
oppress
another
in
this
way
then
you
are
protected
the
arrangement
was
carried
out
and
just
because
it
was
carried
out
the
old
idea
of
kingship
developed
with
time
and
progress
into
quite
a
different
idea
and
put
the
other
one
in
the
background
where
it
may
still
be
seen
now
and
then
flitting
about
like
a
spectre
its
place
has
been
taken
by
the
idea
of
the
king
as
father
of
his
people
as
the
firm
and
unshakable
pillar
which
alone
supports
and
maintains
the
whole
organisation
of
law
and
order
and
consequently
the
rights
of
every
man
but
a
king
can
accomplish
this
only
by
inborn
prerogative
which
reserves
authority
to
him
and
to
him
alone
an
authority
which
is
supreme
indubitable
and
beyond
all
attack
nay
to
which
every
one
renders
instinctive
obedience
hence
the
king
is
rightly
said
to
rule
by
the
grace
of
god
he
is
always
the
most
useful
person
in
the
state
and
his
services
are
never
too
dearly
repaid
by
any
civil
list
however
heavy
footnote
we
read
in
stobaeus
ch
of
a
persian
custom
by
which
whenever
a
king
died
there
was
a
five
anarchy
in
order
that
people
might
perceive
the
advantage
of
having
kings
and
laws
but
even
as
late
a
writer
as
macchiavelli
was
so
decidedly
imbued
with
the
earlier
or
mediaeval
conception
of
the
position
of
a
prince
that
he
treats
it
as
a
matter
which
is
he
never
discusses
it
but
tacitly
takes
it
as
the
presupposition
and
basis
of
his
advice
it
may
be
said
generally
that
his
book
is
merely
the
theoretical
statement
and
consistent
and
systematic
exposition
of
the
practice
prevailing
in
his
time
it
is
the
novel
statement
of
it
in
a
complete
theoretical
form
that
lends
it
such
a
poignant
interest
the
same
thing
i
may
remark
in
passing
applies
to
the
immortal
little
work
of
la
rochefaucauld
who
however
takes
private
and
not
public
life
for
his
theme
and
offers
not
advice
but
observations
the
title
of
this
fine
little
book
is
open
perhaps
to
some
objection
the
contents
are
not
as
a
rule
either
or
but
and
that
is
what
they
should
be
called
there
is
much
too
in
macchiavelli
that
will
be
found
also
to
apply
to
private
life
right
in
itself
is
powerless
in
nature
it
is
might
that
rules
to
enlist
might
on
the
side
of
right
so
that
by
means
of
it
right
may
rule
is
the
problem
of
statesmanship
and
it
is
indeed
a
hard
problem
as
will
be
obvious
if
we
remember
that
almost
every
human
breast
is
the
seat
of
an
egoism
which
has
no
limits
and
is
usually
associated
with
an
accumulated
store
of
hatred
and
malice
so
that
at
the
very
start
feelings
of
enmity
largely
prevail
over
those
of
friendship
we
have
also
to
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
many
millions
of
individuals
so
constituted
who
have
to
be
kept
in
the
bonds
of
law
and
order
peace
and
tranquillity
whereas
originally
every
one
had
a
right
to
say
to
every
one
else
am
just
as
good
as
you
a
consideration
of
all
this
must
fill
us
with
surprise
that
on
the
whole
the
world
pursues
its
way
so
peacefully
and
quietly
and
with
so
much
law
and
order
as
we
see
to
exist
it
is
the
machinery
of
state
which
alone
accomplishes
it
for
it
is
physical
power
alone
which
has
any
direct
action
on
men
constituted
as
they
generally
are
it
is
for
physical
power
alone
that
they
have
any
feeling
or
respect
if
a
man
would
convince
himself
by
experience
that
this
is
the
case
he
need
do
nothing
but
remove
all
compulsion
from
his
fellows
and
try
to
govern
them
by
clearly
and
forcibly
representing
to
them
what
is
reasonable
right
and
fair
though
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
contrary
to
their
interests
he
would
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
as
things
go
that
is
the
only
answer
he
would
get
it
would
soon
be
obvious
to
him
that
moral
force
alone
is
powerless
it
is
then
physical
force
alone
which
is
capable
of
securing
respect
now
this
force
ultimately
resides
in
the
masses
where
it
is
associated
with
ignorance
stupidity
and
injustice
accordingly
the
main
aim
of
statesmanship
in
these
difficult
circumstances
is
to
put
physical
force
in
subjection
to
mental
force
to
intellectual
superiority
and
thus
to
make
it
serviceable
but
if
this
aim
is
not
itself
accompanied
by
justice
and
good
intentions
the
result
of
the
business
if
it
succeeds
is
that
the
state
so
erected
consists
of
knaves
and
fools
the
deceivers
and
the
deceived
that
this
is
the
case
is
made
gradually
evident
by
the
progress
of
intelligence
amongst
the
masses
however
much
it
may
be
repressed
and
it
leads
to
revolution
but
if
contrarily
intelligence
is
accompanied
by
justice
and
good
intentions
there
arises
a
state
as
perfect
as
the
character
of
human
affairs
will
allow
it
is
very
much
to
the
purpose
if
justice
and
good
intentions
not
only
exist
but
are
also
demonstrable
and
openly
exhibited
and
can
be
called
to
account
publicly
and
be
subject
to
control
care
must
be
taken
however
lest
the
resulting
participation
of
many
persons
in
the
work
of
government
should
affect
the
unity
of
the
state
and
inflict
a
loss
of
strength
and
concentration
on
the
power
by
which
its
home
and
foreign
affairs
have
to
be
administered
this
is
what
almost
always
happens
in
republics
to
produce
a
constitution
which
should
satisfy
all
these
demands
would
accordingly
be
the
highest
aim
of
statesmanship
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
statesmanship
has
to
consider
other
things
as
well
it
has
to
reckon
with
the
people
as
they
exist
and
their
national
peculiarities
this
is
the
raw
material
on
which
it
has
to
work
and
the
ingredients
of
that
material
will
always
exercise
a
great
effect
on
the
completed
scheme
statesmanship
will
have
achieved
a
good
deal
if
it
so
far
attains
its
object
as
to
reduce
wrong
and
injustice
in
the
community
to
a
minimum
to
banish
them
altogether
and
to
leave
no
trace
of
them
is
merely
the
ideal
to
be
aimed
at
and
it
is
only
approximately
that
it
can
be
reached
if
they
disappear
in
one
direction
they
creep
in
again
in
another
for
wrong
and
injustice
lie
deeply
rooted
in
human
nature
attempts
have
been
made
to
attain
the
desired
aim
by
artificial
constitutions
and
systematic
codes
of
law
but
they
are
not
in
complete
touch
with
the
facts
they
remain
an
asymptote
for
the
simple
reason
that
hard
and
fast
conceptions
never
embrace
all
possible
cases
and
can
not
be
made
to
meet
individual
instances
such
conceptions
resemble
the
stones
of
a
mosaic
rather
than
the
delicate
shading
in
a
picture
nay
more
all
experiments
in
this
matter
are
attended
with
danger
because
the
material
in
question
namely
the
human
race
is
the
most
difficult
of
all
material
to
handle
it
is
almost
as
dangerous
as
an
explosive
no
doubt
it
is
true
that
in
the
machinery
of
the
state
the
freedom
of
the
press
performs
the
same
function
as
a
in
other
machinery
for
it
enables
all
discontent
to
find
a
voice
nay
in
doing
so
the
discontent
exhausts
itself
if
it
has
not
much
substance
and
if
it
has
there
is
an
advantage
in
recognising
it
betimes
and
applying
the
remedy
this
is
much
better
than
to
repress
the
discontent
and
let
it
simmer
and
ferment
and
go
on
increasing
until
it
ends
in
an
explosion
on
the
other
hand
the
freedom
of
the
press
may
be
regarded
as
a
permission
to
sell
poison
poison
for
the
heart
and
the
mind
there
is
no
idea
so
foolish
but
that
it
can
not
be
put
into
the
heads
of
the
ignorant
and
incapable
multitude
especially
if
the
idea
holds
out
some
prospect
of
any
gain
or
advantage
and
when
a
man
has
got
hold
of
any
such
idea
what
is
there
that
he
will
not
do
i
am
therefore
very
much
afraid
that
the
danger
of
a
free
press
outweighs
its
utility
particularly
where
the
law
offers
a
way
of
redressing
wrongs
in
any
case
however
the
freedom
of
the
press
should
be
governed
by
a
very
strict
prohibition
of
all
and
every
anonymity
generally
indeed
it
may
be
maintained
that
right
is
of
a
nature
analogous
to
that
of
certain
chemical
substances
which
can
not
be
exhibited
in
a
pure
and
isolated
condition
but
at
the
most
only
with
a
small
admixture
of
some
other
substance
which
serves
as
a
vehicle
for
them
or
gives
them
the
necessary
consistency
such
as
fluorine
or
even
alcohol
or
prussic
acid
pursuing
the
analogy
we
may
say
that
right
if
it
is
to
gain
a
footing
in
the
world
and
really
prevail
must
of
necessity
be
supplemented
by
a
small
amount
of
arbitrary
force
in
order
that
notwithstanding

a

one
no
matter
how
reasonable
the
change
might
be
or
how
often
it
has
been
attempted
to
make
it
because
no
other
system
could
ever
yield
the

certainty
and
stability
of

just
in
the
same
way
the
artificial
and
arbitrary
basis
on
which
as
has
been
shown
the
constitution
of
a
state
rests
can
never
be
replaced
by
a
purely
natural
basis
a

would
aim
at
doing
away
with
the
conditions
that
have
been

in
the
place
of

it
would
put

and
so
on
however
agreeable
to

this
might
all
prove
the

could
not
be
made
because
a
natural

would
lack
that
certainty
and
fixity
of
definition
which
alone
secures
the
stability
of
the
commonwealth
a
constitution
which
embodied
abstract
right
alone
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
natures
other
than
human
but
since
the
great
majority
of
men
are
extremely
egoistic
unjust
inconsiderate
deceitful
and
sometimes
even
malicious
since
in
addition
they
are
endowed
with
very
scanty
intelligence
there
arises
the
necessity
for
a
power
that
shall
be
concentrated
in
one
man
a
power
that
shall
be
above
all
law
and
right
and
be
completely
irresponsible
nay
to
which
everything
shall
yield
as
to
something
that
is
regarded
as
a
creature
of
a
higher
kind
a
ruler
by
the
grace
of

it
is
only
thus
that
men
can
be
permanently
held

and
governed
the

exhibit
the
attempt
to
proceed
without
any
such
arbitrary
basis
that
is
to
say
to
allow
abstract
right
to
prevail
pure
and
unalloyed
but
the
result
is
not
attractive
for
with
all
the
material
prosperity
of
the

what
do
we
find
the
prevailing
sentiment
is
a
base
utilitarianism
with
its
inevitable
companion
ignorance
and
it
is
this
that
has
paved
the
way
for
a
union
of
stupid
anglican

foolish
prejudice
coarse
brutality
and
a
childish

by

which
every
one
in
the
country
knew
to
be
such
and
laughed
at
an
ochlocracy
and
finally
all
the
disastrous
influence
which
this
abnegation
of
justice
in
high
quarters
must
have
exercised
on
private
morals
this
specimen
of
a
pure
constitution
on
the
obverse
side
of
the
planet
says
very
little
for
republics
in
general
but
still
less
for
the
imitations
of
it
in
mexico
guatemala
colombia
and
peru
a
peculiar
disadvantage
attaching
to
republics
and
one
that
might
not
be
looked
for
is
that
in
this
form
of
government
it
must
be
more
difficult
for
men
of
ability
to
attain
high
position
and
exercise
direct
political
influence
than
in
the
case
of
monarchies
for
always
and
everywhere
and
under
all
circumstances
there
is
a
conspiracy
or
instinctive
alliance
against
such
men
on
the
part
of
all
the
stupid
the
weak
and
the
commonplace
they
look
upon
such
men
as
their
natural
enemies
and
they
are
firmly
held
together
by
a
common
fear
of
them
there
is
always
a
numerous
host
of
the
stupid
and
the
weak
and
in
a
republican
constitution
it
is
easy
for
them
to
suppress
and
exclude
the
men
of
ability
so
that
they
may
not
be
outflanked
by
them
they
are
fifty
to
one
and
here
all
have
equal
rights
at
the
start
in
a
monarchy
on
the
other
hand
this
natural
and
universal
league
of
the
stupid
against
those
who
are
possessed
of
intellectual
advantages
is
a
affair
it
exists
only
from
below
for
in
a
monarchy
talent
and
intelligence
receive
a
natural
advocacy
and
support
from
above
in
the
first
place
the
position
of
the
monarch
himself
is
much
too
high
and
too
firm
for
him
to
stand
in
fear
of
any
sort
of
competition
in
the
next
place
he
serves
the
state
more
by
his
will
than
by
his
intelligence
for
no
intelligence
could
ever
be
equal
to
all
the
demands
that
would
in
his
case
be
made
upon
it
he
is
therefore
compelled
to
be
always
availing
himself
of
other
intelligence
seeing
that
his
own
interests
are
securely
bound
up
with
those
of
his
country
that
they
are
inseparable
from
them
and
one
with
them
he
will
naturally
give
the
preference
to
the
best
men
because
they
are
his
most
serviceable
instruments
and
he
will
bestow
his
favour
upon
them
as
soon
that
is
as
he
can
find
them
which
is
not
so
difficult
if
only
an
honest
search
be
made
just
in
the
same
way
even
ministers
of
state
have
too
much
advantage
over
rising
politicians
to
need
to
regard
them
with
jealousy
and
accordingly
for
analogous
reasons
they
are
glad
to
single
out
distinguished
men
and
set
them
to
work
in
order
to
make
use
of
their
powers
for
themselves
it
is
in
this
way
that
intelligence
has
always
under
a
monarchical
government
a
much
better
chance
against
its
irreconcilable
and
foe
stupidity
and
the
advantage
which
it
gains
is
very
great
in
general
the
monarchical
form
of
government
is
that
which
is
natural
to
man
just
as
it
is
natural
to
bees
and
ants
to
a
flight
of
cranes
a
herd
of
wandering
elephants
a
pack
of
wolves
seeking
prey
in
common
and
many
other
animals
all
of
which
place
one
of
their
number
at
the
head
of
the
business
in
hand
every
business
in
which
men
engage
if
it
is
attended
with
danger
every
campaign
every
ship
at
sea
must
also
be
subject
to
the
authority
of
one
commander
everywhere
it
is
one
will
that
must
lead
even
the
animal
organism
is
constructed
on
a
monarchical
principle
it
is
the
brain
alone
which
guides
and
governs
and
exercises
the
hegemony
although
heart
lungs
and
stomach
contribute
much
more
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
whole
body
these
philistines
can
not
on
that
account
be
allowed
to
guide
and
lead
that
is
a
business
which
belongs
solely
to
the
brain
government
must
proceed
from
one
central
point
even
the
solar
system
is
monarchical
on
the
other
hand
a
republic
is
as
unnatural
as
it
is
unfavourable
to
the
higher
intellectual
life
and
the
arts
and
sciences
accordingly
we
find
that
everywhere
in
the
world
and
at
all
times
nations
whether
civilised
or
savage
or
occupying
a
position
between
the
two
are
always
under
monarchical
government
the
rule
of
many
as

said
is
not
a
good
thing

there
be

how
would
it
be
possible
that
everywhere
and
at
all
times
we
should
see
many
millions
of
people
nay
even
hundreds
of
millions
become
the
willing
and
obedient
subjects
of
one
man
sometimes
even
one
woman
and
provisionally
even
of
a
child
unless
there
were
a
monarchical
instinct
in
men
which
drove
them
to
it
as
the
form
of
government
best
suited
to
them
this
arrangement
is
not
the
product
of
reflection
everywhere
one
man
is
king
and
for
the
most
part
his
dignity
is
hereditary
he
is
as
it
were
the
personification
the
monogram
of
the
whole
people
which
attains
an
individuality
in
him
in
this
sense
he
can
rightly
say
it
is
precisely
for
this
reason
that
in
shakespeare
historical
plays
the
kings
of
england
and
france
mutually
address
each
other
as
and
and
the
duke
of
austria
goes
by
the
name
of
his
country
it
is
as
though
the
kings
regarded
themselves
as
the
incarnation
of
their
nationalities
it
is
all
in
accordance
with
human
nature
and
for
this
very
reason
the
hereditary
monarch
can
not
separate
his
own
welfare
and
that
of
his
family
from
the
welfare
of
his
country
as
on
the
other
hand
mostly
happens
when
the
monarch
is
elected
as
for
instance
in
the
states
of
the
church
the
chinese
can
conceive
of
a
monarchical
government
only
what
a
republic
is
they
utterly
fail
to
understand
when
a
dutch
legation
was
in
china
in
the
year
it
was
obliged
to
represent
that
the
prince
of
orange
was
their
king

otherwise

stobaeus
in

he
wrote

is
collected
the
best
of
the
passages
in
which
the
ancients
explained
the
advantages
of
that
form
of
government
in
a
word
republics
are
unnatural
and
artificial
they
are
the
product
of
reflection
hence
it
is
that
they
occur
only
as
rare
exceptions
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
there
were
the
small
greek
republics
the
roman
and
the
carthaginian
but
they
were
all
rendered
possible
by
the
fact
that
perhaps
even
of
the
population
consisted
of
slaves
in
the
year
even
in
the
united
states
there
were
three
million
slaves
to
a
population
of
sixteen
millions
then
again
the
duration
of
the
republics
of
antiquity
compared
with
that
of
monarchies
was
very
short
republics
are
very
easy
to
found
and
very
difficult
to
maintain
while
with
monarchies
it
is
exactly
the
reverse
if
it
is
utopian
schemes
that
are
wanted
i
say
this
the
only
solution
of
the
problem
would
be
a
despotism
of
the
wise
and
the
noble
of
the
true
aristocracy
and
the
genuine
nobility
brought
about
by
the
method
of
generation
that
is
by
the
marriage
of
the
noblest
men
with
the
cleverest
and
most
intellectual
women

it

without

will
always
be

as

no

live
in
the
days

the

here
again
it
is
hardly

to
say
that

died
in

this

some
years
previously
can
not
be
referring
to
any
of
the

which
culminated
in
the
whole
passage
forms
a
striking
illustration
of
his
political
sagacity
the
english
show
their
great
intelligence
amongst
other
ways
by
clinging
to
their
ancient
institutions
customs
and
usages
and
by
holding
them
sacred
even
at
the
risk
of
carrying
this
tenacity
too
far
and
making
it
ridiculous
they
hold
them
sacred
for
the
simple
reason
that
those
institutions
and
customs
are
not
the
invention
of
an
idle
head
but
have
grown
up
gradually
by
the
force
of
circumstance
and
the
wisdom
of
life
itself
and
are
therefore
suited
to
them
as
a
nation
on
the
other
hand
the
german
michel
allows
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
his
schoolmaster
that
he
must
go
about
in
an
english
and
that
nothing
else
will
do
accordingly
he
has
bullied
his
father
into
giving
it
to
him
and
with
his
awkward
manners
this
ungainly
creature
presents
in
it
a
sufficiently
ridiculous
figure
but
the
will
some
day
be
too
tight
for
him
and
incommode
him
it
will
not
be
very
long
before
he
feels
it
in
trial
by
jury
this
institution
arose
in
the
most
barbarous
period
of
the
middle
ages
the
times
of
alfred
the
great
when
the
ability
to
read
and
write
exempted
a
man
from
the
penalty
of
death
it
is
the
worst
of
all
criminal
procedures
instead
of
judges
well
versed
in
law
and
of
great
experience
who
have
grown
grey
in
daily
unravelling
the
tricks
and
wiles
of
thieves
murderers
and
rascals
of
all
sorts
and
so
are
well
able
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
things
it
is
gossiping
tailors
and
tanners
who
sit
in
judgment
it
is
their
coarse
crude
unpractised
and
awkward
intelligence
incapable
of
any
sustained
attention
that
is
called
upon
to
find
out
the
truth
from
a
tissue
of
lies
and
deceit
all
the
time
moreover
they
are
thinking
of
their
cloth
and
their
leather
and
longing
to
be
at
home
and
they
have
absolutely
no
clear
notion
at
all
of
the
distinction
between
probability
and
certainty
it
is
with
this
sort
of
a
calculus
of
probabilities

their
stupid
heads
that
they
confidently
undertake

it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
michel
is
sometimes
used
by
the
germans
as
a
nickname
of
their
nation
corresponding
to
john
bull
as
a
nickname
of
the
english
flügel
in
his
dictionary
declares
that
deutsche
represents
the
german
nation
as
an
honest
blunt
unsuspicious
fellow
who
easily
allows
himself
to
be
imposed
upon
even
he
adds
with
a
touch
of
patriotism
by
those
who
are
greatly
his
inferiors
in
point
of
strength
and
real
worth
the
same
remark
is
applicable
to
them
which
johnson
made
of
a
in
which
he
had
little
confidence
summoned
to
decide
a
very
important
case
he
said
that
perhaps
there
was
not
a
member
of
it
who
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
had
ever
spent
an
hour
by
himself
in
balancing
probabilities
can
any
one
imagine
that
the
tailor
and
the
tanner
would
be
impartial
judges
what
the
vicious
multitude
impartial
as
if
partiality
were
not
ten
times
more
to
be
feared
from
men
of
the

class
as
the
accused
than
from

who
knew
nothing

boswell
set
everywhere
and
at
all
times
there
has
been
much
discontent
with
governments
laws
and
public
regulations
for
the
most
part
however
because
men
are
always
ready
to
make
institutions
responsible
for
the
misery
inseparable
from
human
existence
itself
which
is
to
speak
mythically
the
curse
that
was
laid
on
adam
and
through
him
on
the
whole
race
but
never
has
that
delusion
been
proclaimed
in
a
more
mendacious
and
impudent
manner
than
by
the
demagogues
of
the
of
the
day
we
live
in
as
enemies
of
christianity
they
are
of
course
optimists
to
them
the
world
is
its
own
end
and
object
and
accordingly
in
itself
that
is
to
say
in
its
own
natural
constitution
it
is
arranged
on
the
most
excellent
principles
and
forms
a
regular
habitation
of
bliss
the
enormous
and
glaring
evils
of
the
world
they
attribute
wholly
to
governments
if
governments
they
think
were
to
do
their
duty
there
would
be
a
heaven
upon
earth
in
other
words
all
men
could
eat
drink
propagate
and
die
free
from
trouble
and
want
this
is
what
they
mean
when
they
talk
of
the
world
being
its
own
end
and
object
this
is
the
goal
of
that
perpetual
progress
of
the
human
race
and
the
other
fine
things
which
they
are
never
tired
of
proclaiming
formerly
it
was
which
was
the
chief
support
of
the
throne
nowadays
it
is
the
pope
himself
is
scarcely
more
concerned
to
retain
the
confidence
of
the
faithful
than
to
make
his
creditors
believe
in
his
own
good
faith
if
in
times
past
it
was
the
guilty
debt
of
the
world
which
was
lamented
now
it
is
the
financial
debts
of
the
world
which
arouse
dismay
formerly
it
was
the
last
day
which
was
prophesied
now
it
is
the
greek
seisachtheia
the
great
repudiation
the
universal
bankruptcy
of
the
nations
which
will
one
day
happen
although
the
prophet
in
this
as
in
the
other
case
entertains
a
firm
hope
that
he
will
not
live
to
see
it
himself
from
an
ethical
and
a
rational
point
of
view
the
of
rests
upon
an
incomparably
better
foundation
than
the
of
nevertheless
the
right
of
possession
is
allied
with
the
right
of
birth
and
has
come
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
it
so
that
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
abolish
the
right
of
birth
without
endangering
the
right
of
possession
the
reason
of
this
is
that
most
of
what
a
man
possesses
he
inherited
and
therefore
holds
by
a
kind
of
right
of
birth
just
as
the
old
nobility
bear
the
names
only
of
their
hereditary
estates
and
by
the
use
of
those
names
do
no
more
than
give
expression
to
the
fact
that
they
own
the
estates
accordingly
all
owners
of
property
if
instead
of
being
envious
they
were
wise
ought
also
to
support
the
maintenance
of
the
rights
of
birth
the
existence
of
a
nobility
has
then
a
double
advantage
it
helps
to
maintain
on
the
one
hand
the
rights
of
possession
and
on
the
other
the
right
of
birth
belonging
to
the
king
for
the
king
is
the
first
nobleman
in
the
country
and
as
a
general
rule
he
treats
the
nobility
as
his
humble
relations
and
regards
them
quite
otherwise
than
the
commoners
however
trusty
and
it
is
quite
natural
too
that
he
should
have
more
confidence
in
those
whose
ancestors
were
mostly
the
first
ministers
and
always
the
immediate
associates
of
his
own
a
nobleman
therefore
appeals
with
reason
to
the
name
he
bears
when
on
the
occurrence
of
anything
to
rouse
distrust
he
repeats
his
assurance
of
fidelity
and
service
to
the
king
a
man
character
as
my
readers
are
aware
assuredly
comes
to
him
from
his
father
it
is
a
and
ridiculous
thing
not
to
consider
whose
son
a
man
is
and
fatalism
no
thoughtful
man
can
have
any
doubt
after
the
conclusions
reached
in
my
on
that
such
freedom
is
to
be
sought
not
anywhere
in
nature
but
outside
of
it
the
only
freedom
that
exists
is
of
a
metaphysical
character
in
the
physical
world
freedom
is
an
impossibility
accordingly
while
our
several
actions
are
in
no
wise
free
every
man
individual
character
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
free
act
he
is
such
and
such
a
man
because
once
for
all
it
is
his
will
to
be
that
man
for
the
will
itself
and
in
itself
and
also
in
so
far
as
it
is
manifest
in
an
individual
and
accordingly
constitutes
the
original
and
fundamental
desires
of
that
individual
is
independent
of
all
knowledge
because
it
is
antecedent
to
such
knowledge
all
that
it
receives
from
knowledge
is
the
series
of
motives
by
which
it
successively
develops
its
nature
and
makes
itself
cognisable
or
visible
but
the
will
itself
as
something
that
lies
beyond
time
and
so
long
as
it
exists
at
all
never
changes
therefore
every
man
being
what
he
is
and
placed
in
the
circumstances
which
for
the
moment
obtain
but
which
on
their
part
also
arise
by
strict
necessity
can
absolutely
never
do
anything
else
than
just
what
at
that
moment
he
does
do
accordingly
the
whole
course
of
a
man
life
in
all
its
incidents
great
and
small
is
as
necessarily
predetermined
as
the
course
of
a
clock
the
main
reason
of
this
is
that
the
kind
of
metaphysical
free
act
which
i
have
described
tends
to
become
a
knowing
consciousness
a
perceptive
intuition
which
is
subject
to
the
forms
of
space
and
time
by
means
of
those
forms
the
unity
and
indivisibility
of
the
act
are
represented
as
drawn
asunder
into
a
series
of
states
and
events
which
are
subject
to
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
in
its
four
forms
and
it
is
this
that
is
meant
by
but
the
result
of
it
all
assumes
a
moral
complexion
it
amounts
to
this
that
by
what
we
do
we
know
what
we
are
and
by
what
we
suffer
we
know
what
we
deserve
further
it
follows
from
this
that
a
man
does
not
rest
upon
the
principle
of
individuation
alone
and
therefore
is
not
altogether
phenomenal
in
its
nature
on
the
contrary
it
has
its
roots
in
the
in
the
will
which
is
the
essence
of
each
individual
the
character
of
this
individual
is
itself
individual
but
how
deep
the
roots
of
individuality
extend
is
one
of
the
questions
which
i
do
not
undertake
to
answer
in
this
connection
it
deserves
to
be
mentioned
that
even
plato
in
his
own
way
represented
the
individuality
of
a
man
as
a
free
act
he
represented
him
as
coming
into
the
world
with
a
given
tendency
which
was
the
result
of
the
feelings
and
character
already
attaching
to
him
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
the
brahmin
philosophers
also
express
the
unalterable
fixity
of
innate
character
in
a
mystical
fashion
they
say
that
brahma
when
a
man
is
produced
engraves
his
doings
and
sufferings
in
written
characters
on
his
skull
and
that
his
life
must
take
shape
in
accordance
therewith
they
point
to
the
jagged
edges
in
the
sutures
of
the
as
evidence
of
this
writing
and
the
purport
of
it
they
say
depends
on
his
previous
life
and
actions
the
same
view
appears
to
underlie
the
christian
or
rather
the
pauline
dogma
of
predestination
footnote
and
x
but
this
truth
which
is
universally
confirmed
by
experience
is
attended
with
another
result
all
genuine
merit
moral
as
well
as
intellectual
is
not
merely
physical
or
empirical
in
its
origin
but
metaphysical
that
is
to
say
it
is
given
and
not
in
other
words
it
lies
innate
and
is
not
acquired
and
therefore
its
source
is
not
a
mere
phenomenon
but
the
hence
it
is
that
every
man
achieves
only
that
which
is
irrevocably
established
in
his
nature
or
is
born
with
him
intellectual
capacity
needs
it
is
true
to
be
developed
just
as
many
natural
products
need
to
be
cultivated
in
order
that
we
may
enjoy
or
use
them
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
a
natural
product
no
cultivation
can
take
the
place
of
original
material
neither
can
it
do
so
in
the
case
of
intellect
that
is
the
reason
why
qualities
which
are
merely
acquired
or
learned
or
enforced
that
is
qualities
whether
moral
or
intellectual
are
not
real
or
genuine
but
superficial
only
and
possessed
of
no
value
this
is
a
conclusion
of
true
metaphysics
and
experience
teaches
the
same
lesson
to
all
who
can
look
below
the
surface
nay
it
is
proved
by
the
great
importance
which
we
all
attach
to
such
innate
characteristics
as
physiognomy
and
external
appearance
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
is
at
all
distinguished
and
that
is
why
we
are
so
curious
to
see
him
superficial
people
to
be
sure
and
for
very
good
reasons
commonplace
people
too
will
be
of
the
opposite
opinion
for
if
anything
fails
them
they
will
thus
be
enabled
to
console
themselves
by
thinking
that
it
is
still
to
come
the
world
then
is
not
merely
a
battlefield
where
victory
and
defeat
receive
their
due
recompense
in
a
future
state
no
the
world
is
itself
the
last
judgment
on
it
every
man
carries
with
him
the
reward
and
the
disgrace
that
he
deserves
and
this
is
no
other
than
the
doctrine
of
the
brahmins
and
buddhists
as
it
is
taught
in
the
theory
of
metempsychosis
the
question
has
been
raised
what
two
men
would
do
who
lived
a
solitary
life
in
the
wilds
and
met
each
other
for
the
first
time
hobbes
pufendorf
and
rousseau
have
given
different
answers
pufendorf
believed
that
they
would
approach
each
other
as
friends
hobbes
on
the
contrary
as
enemies
rousseau
that
they
would
pass
each
other
by
in
silence
all
three
are
both
right
and
wrong
this
is
just
a
case
in
which
the
incalculable
difference
that
there
is
in
innate
moral
disposition
between
one
individual
and
another
would
make
its
appearance
the
difference
is
so
strong
that
the
question
here
raised
might
be
regarded
as
the
standard
and
measure
of
it
for
there
are
men
in
whom
the
sight
of
another
man
at
once
rouses
a
feeling
of
enmity
since
their
inmost
nature
exclaims
at
once
that
is
not
me
there
are
others
in
whom
the
sight
awakens
immediate
sympathy
their
inmost
nature
says
is
me
over
between
the
two
there
are
countless
degrees
that
in
this
most
important
matter
we
are
so
totally
different
is
a
great
problem
nay
a
mystery
in
regard
to
this
nature
of
moral
character
there
is
matter
for
varied
reflection
in
a
work
by
bastholm
a
danish
writer
entitled
contributions
to
the
knowledge
of
man
in
the
savage
he
is
struck
by
the
fact
that
intellectual
culture
and
moral
excellence
are
shown
to
be
entirely
independent
of
each
other
inasmuch
as
one
is
often
found
without
the
other
the
reason
of
this
as
we
shall
find
is
simply
that
moral
excellence
in
no
wise
springs
from
reflection
which
is
developed
by
intellectual
culture
but
from
the
will
itself
the
constitution
of
which
is
innate
and
not
susceptible
in
itself
of
any
improvement
by
means
of
education
bastholm
represents
most
nations
as
very
vicious
and
immoral
and
on
the
other
hand
he
reports
that
excellent
traits
of
character
are
found
amongst
some
savage
peoples
as
for
instance
amongst
the
orotchyses
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
savu
the
tunguses
and
the
pelew
islanders
he
thus
attempts
to
solve
the
problem
how
it
is
that
some
tribes
are
so
remarkably
good
when
their
neighbours
are
all
bad
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difficulty
may
be
explained
as
follows
moral
qualities
as
we
know
are
heritable
and
an
isolated
tribe
such
as
is
described
might
take
its
rise
in
some
one
family
and
ultimately
in
a
single
ancestor
who
happened
to
be
a
good
man
and
then
maintain
its
purity
is
it
not
the
case
for
instance
that
on
many
unpleasant
occasions
such
as
repudiation
of
public
debts
filibustering
raids
and
so
on
the
english
have
often
reminded
the
north
americans
of
their
descent
from
english
penal
colonists
it
is
a
reproach
however
which
can
apply
only
to
a
small
part
of
the
population
it
is
marvellous
how
man
that
is
to
say
the
union
of
a
definite
character
with
a
definite
intellect
accurately
determines
all
his
actions
and
thoughts
down
to
the
most
unimportant
details
as
though
it
were
a
dye
which
pervaded
them
and
how
in
consequence
one
man
whole
course
of
life
in
other
words
his
inner
and
outer
history
turns
out
so
absolutely
different
from
another
as
a
botanist
knows
a
plant
in
its
entirety
from
a
single
leaf
as
cuvier
from
a
single
bone
constructed
the
whole
animal
so
an
accurate
knowledge
of
a
man
whole
character
may
be
attained
from
a
single
characteristic
act
that
is
to
say
he
himself
may
to
some
extent
be
constructed
from
it
even
though
the
act
in
question
is
of
very
trifling
consequence
nay
that
is
the
most
perfect
test
of
all
for
in
a
matter
of
importance
people
are
on
their
guard
in
trifles
they
follow
their
natural
bent
without
much
reflection
that
is
why
seneca
remark
that
even
the
smallest
things
may
be
taken
as
evidence
of
character
is
so
true
morum
ex
minimis
quoque
licet
if
a
man
shows
by
his
absolutely
unscrupulous
and
selfish
behaviour
in
small
things
that
a
sentiment
of
justice
is
foreign
to
his
disposition
he
should
not
be
trusted
with
a
penny
unless
on
due
security
for
who
will
believe
that
the
man
who
every
day
shows
that
he
is
unjust
in
all
matters
other
than
those
which
concern
property
and
whose
boundless
selfishness
everywhere
protrudes
through
the
small
affairs
of
ordinary
life
which
are
subject
to
no
scrutiny
like
a
dirty
shirt
through
the
holes
of
a
ragged
jacket
who
i
ask
will
believe
that
such
a
man
will
act
honourably
in
matters
of
and
without
any
other
incentive
but
that
of
justice
the
man
who
has
no
conscience
in
small
things
will
be
a
scoundrel
in
big
things
if
we
neglect
small
traits
of
character
we
have
only
ourselves
to
blame
if
we
afterwards
learn
to
our
disadvantage
what
this
character
is
in
the
great
affairs
of
life
on
the
same
principle
we
ought
to
break
with
friends
even
in
matters
of
trifling
moment
if
they
show
a
character
that
is
malicious
or
bad
or
vulgar
so
that
we
may
avoid
the
bad
turn
which
only
waits
for
an
opportunity
of
being
done
us
the
same
thing
applies
to
servants
let
it
always
be
our
maxim
better
alone
than
amongst
traitors
footnote
of
a
truth
the
first
and
foremost
step
in
all
knowledge
of
mankind
is
the
conviction
that
a
man
conduct
taken
as
a
whole
and
in
all
its
essential
particulars
is
not
governed
by
his
reason
or
by
any
of
the
resolutions
which
he
may
make
in
virtue
of
it
no
man
becomes
this
or
that
by
wishing
to
be
it
however
earnestly
his
acts
proceed
from
his
innate
and
unalterable
character
and
they
are
more
immediately
and
particularly
determined
by
motives
a
man
conduct
therefore
is
the
necessary
product
of
both
character
and
motive
it
may
be
illustrated
by
the
course
of
a
planet
which
is
the
result
of
the
combined
effect
of
the
tangential
energy
with
which
it
is
endowed
and
the
centripetal
energy
which
operates
from
the
sun
in
this
simile
the
former
energy
represents
character
and
the
latter
the
influence
of
motive
it
is
almost
more
than
a
mere
simile
the
tangential
energy
which
properly
speaking
is
the
source
of
the
planet
motion
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
motion
is
kept
in
check
by
gravitation
is
from
a
metaphysical
point
of
view
the
will
manifesting
itself
in
that
body
to
grasp
this
fact
is
to
see
that
we
really
never
form
anything
more
than
a
conjecture
of
what
we
shall
do
under
circumstances
which
are
still
to
happen
although
we
often
take
our
conjecture
for
a
resolve
when
for
instance
in
pursuance
of
a
proposal
a
man
with
the
greatest
sincerity
and
even
eagerness
accepts
an
engagement
to
do
this
or
that
on
the
occurrence
of
a
certain
future
event
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
he
will
fulfil
the
engagement
unless
he
is
so
constituted
that
the
promise
which
he
gives
in
itself
and
as
such
is
always
and
everywhere
a
motive
sufficient
for
him
by
acting
upon
him
through
considerations
of
honour
like
some
external
compulsion
but
above
and
beyond
this
what
he
will
do
on
the
occurrence
of
that
event
may
be
foretold
from
true
and
accurate
knowledge
of
his
character
and
the
external
circumstances
under
the
influence
of
which
he
will
fall
and
it
may
with
complete
certainty
be
foretold
from
this
alone
nay
it
is
a
very
easy
prophecy
if
he
has
been
already
seen
in
a
like
position
for
he
will
inevitably
do
the
same
thing
a
second
time
provided
that
on
the
first
occasion
he
had
a
true
and
complete
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
case
for
as
i
have
often
remarked
a
final
cause
does
not
impel
a
man
by
being
real
but
by
being
known

whatever
he
failed
to
recognise
or
understand
the
first
time
could
have
no
influence
upon
his
will
just
as
an
electric
current
stops
when
some
isolating
body
hinders
the
action
of
the
conductor
this
unalterable
nature
of
character
and
the
consequent
necessity
of
our
actions
are
made
very
clear
to
a
man
who
has
not
on
any
given
occasion
behaved
as
he
ought
to
have
done
by
showing
a
lack
either
of
resolution
or
endurance
or
courage
or
some
other
quality
demanded
at
the
moment
afterwards
he
recognises
what
it
is
that
he
ought
to
have
done
and
sincerely
repenting
of
his
incorrect
behaviour
he
thinks
to
himself
the
opportunity
were
offered
to
me
again
i
should
act
it
is
offered
once
more
the
same
occasion
recurs
and
to
his
great
astonishment
he
does
precisely
the
same
thing
over
again

third

the
best
examples
of
the
truth
in
question
are
in
every
way
furnished
by
shakespeare
plays
it
is
a
truth
with
which
he
was
thoroughly
imbued
and
his
intuitive
wisdom
expressed
it
in
a
concrete
shape
on
every
page
i
shall
here
however
give
an
instance
of
it
in
a
case
in
which
he
makes
it
remarkably
clear
without
exhibiting
any
design
or
affectation
in
the
matter
for
he
was
a
real
artist
and
never
set
out
from
general
ideas
his
method
was
obviously
to
work
up
to
the
psychological
truth
which
he
grasped
directly
and
intuitively
regardless
of
the
fact
that
few
would
notice
or
understand
it
and
without
the
smallest
idea
that
some
dull
and
shallow
fellows
in
germany
would
one
day
proclaim
far
and
wide
that
he
wrote
his
works
to
illustrate
moral
commonplaces
i
allude
to
the
character
of
the
earl
of
northumberland
whom
we
find
in
three
plays
in
succession
although
he
does
not
take
a
leading
part
in
any
one
of
them
nay
he
appears
only
in
a
few
scenes
distributed
over
fifteen
acts
consequently
if
the
reader
is
not
very
attentive
a
character
exhibited
at
such
great
intervals
and
its
moral
identity
may
easily
escape
his
notice
even
though
it
has
by
no
means
escaped
the
poet
he
makes
the
earl
appear
everywhere
with
a
noble
and
knightly
grace
and
talk
in
language
suitable
to
it
nay
he
sometimes
puts
very
beautiful
and
even
elevated
passages
into
his
mouth
at
the
same
time
he
is
very
far
from
writing
after
the
manner
of
schiller
who
was
fond
of
painting
the
devil
black
and
whose
moral
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
characters
which
he
presented
could
be
heard
in
their
own
words
with
shakespeare
and
also
with
goethe
every
character
as
long
as
he
is
on
the
stage
and
speaking
seems
to
be
absolutely
in
the
right
even
though
it
were
the
devil
himself
in
this
respect
let
the
reader
compare
duke
alba
as
he
appears
in
goethe
with
the
same
character
in
schiller
we
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
earl
of
northumberland
in
the
play
of
where
he
is
the
first
to
hatch
a
plot
against
the
king
in
favour
of
bolingbroke
afterwards
henry
to
whom
he
even
offers
some
personal
flattery
act
sc
in
the
following
act
he
suffers
a
reprimand
because
in
speaking
of
the
king
he
talks
of
him
as
richard
without
more
ado
but
protests
that
he
did
it
only
for
brevity
sake
a
little
later
his
insidious
words
induce
the
king
to
surrender
in
the
following
act
when
the
king
renounces
the
crown
northumberland
treats
him
with
such
harshness
and
contempt
that
the
unlucky
monarch
is
quite
broken
and
losing
all
patience
once
more
exclaims
to
him
thou
me
ere
i
come
to
at
the
close
northumberland
announces
to
the
new
king
that
he
has
sent
the
heads
of
the
former
king
adherents
to
london
in
the
following
tragedy
he
hatches
a
plot
against
the
new
king
in
just
the
same
way
in
the
fourth
act
we
see
the
rebels
united
making
preparations
for
the
decisive
battle
on
the
morrow
and
only
waiting
impatiently
for
northumberland
and
his
division
at
last
there
arrives
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
is
ill
and
that
he
can
not
entrust
his
force
to
any
one
else
but
that
nevertheless
the
others
should
go
forward
with
courage
and
make
a
brave
fight
they
do
so
but
greatly
weakened
by
his
absence
they
are
completely
defeated
most
of
their
leaders
are
captured
and
his
own
son
the
valorous
hotspur
falls
by
the
hand
of
the
prince
of
wales
again
in
the
following
play
the
part
of
henry
we
see
him
reduced
to
a
state
of
the
fiercest
wrath
by
the
death
of
his
son
and
maddened
by
the
thirst
for
revenge
accordingly
he
kindles
another
rebellion
and
the
heads
of
it
assemble
once
more
in
the
fourth
act
just
as
they
are
about
to
give
battle
and
are
only
waiting
for
him
to
join
them
there
comes
a
letter
saying
that
he
can
not
collect
a
proper
force
and
will
therefore
seek
safety
for
the
present
in
scotland
that
nevertheless
he
heartily
wishes
their
heroic
undertaking
the
best
success
thereupon
they
surrender
to
the
king
under
a
treaty
which
is
not
kept
and
so
perish
so
far
is
character
from
being
the
work
of
reasoned
choice
and
consideration
that
in
any
action
the
intellect
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
present
motives
to
the
will
thereafter
it
looks
on
as
a
mere
spectator
and
witness
at
the
course
which
life
takes
in
accordance
with
the
influence
of
motive
on
the
given
character
all
the
incidents
of
life
occur
strictly
speaking
with
the
same
necessity
as
the
movement
of
a
clock
on
this
point
let
me
refer
to
my
on
freedom
of
the
i
have
there
explained
the
true
meaning
and
origin
of
the
persistent
illusion
that
the
will
is
entirely
free
in
every
single
action
and
i
have
indicated
the
cause
to
which
it
is
due
i
will
only
add
here
the
following
teleological
explanation
of
this
natural
illusion
since
every
single
action
of
a
man
life
seems
to
possess
the
freedom
and
originality
which
in
truth
only
belong
to
his
character
as
he
apprehends
it
and
the
mere
apprehension
of
it
by
his
intellect
is
what
constitutes
his
career
and
since
what
is
original
in
every
single
action
seems
to
the
empirical
consciousness
to
be
always
being
performed
anew
a
man
thus
receives
in
the
course
of
his
career
the
strongest
possible
moral
lesson
then
and
not
before
he
becomes
thoroughly
conscious
of
all
the
bad
sides
of
his
character
conscience
accompanies
every
act
with
the
comment
should
act
although
its
true
sense
is
could
be
other
than
you
as
the
result
of
this
immutability
of
character
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
of
the
strict
necessity
which
attends
all
the
circumstances
in
which
character
is
successively
placed
every
man
course
of
life
is
precisely
determined
from
alpha
right
through
to
omega
but
nevertheless
one
man
course
of
life
turns
out
immeasurably
happier
nobler
and
more
worthy
than
another
whether
it
be
regarded
from
a
subjective
or
an
objective
point
of
view
and
unless
we
are
to
exclude
all
ideas
of
justice
we
are
led
to
the
doctrine
which
is
well
accepted
in
brahmanism
and
buddhism
that
the
subjective
conditions
in
which
as
well
as
the
objective
conditions
under
which
every
man
is
born
are
the
moral
consequences
of
a
previous
existence
macchiavelli
who
seems
to
have
taken
no
interest
whatever
in
philosophical
speculations
is
drawn
by
the
keen
subtlety
of
his
very
unique
understanding
into
the
following
observation
which
possesses
a
really
deep
meaning
it
shows
that
he
had
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
entire
necessity
with
which
characters
and
motives
being
given
all
actions
take
place
he
makes
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
prologue
to
his
comedy
he
says
same
men
were
to
recur
in
the
world
in
the
way
that
the
same
circumstances
recur
a
hundred
years
would
never
elapse
without
our
finding
ourselves
together
once
more
and
doing
the
same
things
as
we
are
doing
now
se
nel
mondo
tornassino
i
medesimi
uomini
como
tornano
i
medesimi
casi
non
passarebbono
mai
cento
anni
che
noi
non
ci
trovassimo
un
altra
volta
insieme
a
fare
le
medesime
cose
che
he
seems
however
to
have
been
drawn
into
the
remark
by
a
reminiscence
of
what
augustine
says
in
his
civitate
bk
ch
xiii
again
fate
or
the
greek
eimarmenae
of
the
ancients
is
nothing
but
the
conscious
certainty
that
all
that
happens
is
fast
bound
by
a
chain
of
causes
and
therefore
takes
place
with
a
strict
necessity
that
the
future
is
already
ordained
with
absolute
certainty
and
can
undergo
as
little
alteration
as
the
past
in
the
fatalistic
myths
of
the
ancients
all
that
can
be
regarded
as
fabulous
is
the
prediction
of
the
future
that
is
if
we
refuse
to
consider
the
possibility
of
magnetic
clairvoyance
and
second
sight
instead
of
trying
to
explain
away
the
fundamental
truth
of
fatalism
by
superficial
twaddle
and
foolish
evasion
a
man
should
attempt
to
get
a
clear
knowledge
and
comprehension
of
it
for
it
is
demonstrably
true
and
it
helps
us
in
a
very
important
way
to
an
understanding
of
the
mysterious
riddle
of
our
life
predestination
and
fatalism
do
not
differ
in
the
main
they
differ
only
in
this
that
with
predestination
the
given
character
and
external
determination
of
human
action
proceed
from
a
rational
being
and
with
fatalism
from
an
irrational
one
but
in
either
case
the
result
is
the
same
that
happens
which
must
happen
on
the
other
hand
the
conception
of
is
inseparable
from
that
of
a
man
may
be
said
but
he
can
not
be
conceived
to
be
the
work
of
another
and
at
the
same
time
be
free
in
respect
of
his
desires
and
acts
he
who
called
him
into
existence
out
of
nothing
in
the
same
process
created
and
determined
his
nature
in
other
words
the
whole
of
his
qualities
for
no
one
can
create
without
creating
a
something
that
is
to
say
a
being
determined
throughout
and
in
all
its
qualities
but
all
that
a
man
says
and
does
necessarily
proceeds
from
the
qualities
so
determined
for
it
is
only
the
qualities
themselves
set
in
motion
it
is
only
some
external
impulse
that
they
require
to
make
their
appearance
as
a
man
is
so
must
he
act
and
praise
or
blame
attaches
not
to
his
separate
acts
but
to
his
nature
and
being
that
is
the
reason
why
theism
and
the
moral
responsibility
of
man
are
incompatible
because
responsibility
always
reverts
to
the
creator
of
man
and
it
is
there
that
it
has
its
centre
vain
attempts
have
been
made
to
make
a
bridge
from
one
of
these
incompatibles
to
the
other
by
means
of
the
conception
of
moral
freedom
but
it
always
breaks
down
again
what
is
must
also
be
if
our
will
is
our
will
is
also
original
and
conversely
dogmatism
tried
to
separate
these
two
predicaments
it
was
thereby
compelled
to
assume
two
kinds
of
freedom
one
cosmological
of
the
first
cause
and
the
other
moral
and
theological
of
human
will
these
are
represented
in
kant
by
the
third
as
well
as
the
fourth
antimony
of
freedom
on
the
other
hand
in
my
philosophy
the
plain
recognition
of
the
strictly
necessary
character
of
all
action
is
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
that
what
manifests
itself
even
in
the
organic
and
irrational
world
is
if
this
were
not
so
the
necessity
under
which
irrational
beings
obviously
act
would
place
their
action
in
conflict
with
will
if
i
mean
there
were
really
such
a
thing
as
the
freedom
of
individual
action
and
this
were
not
as
strictly
necessitated
as
every
other
kind
of
action
but
as
i
have
just
shown
it
is
this
same
doctrine
of
the
necessary
character
of
all
acts
of
will
which
makes
it
needful
to
regard
a
man
existence
and
being
as
itself
the
work
of
his
freedom
and
consequently
of
his
will
the
will
therefore
must
be
it
must
possess
under
the
opposite
supposition
all
responsibility
as
i
have
shown
would
be
at
an
end
and
the
moral
like
the
physical
world
would
be
a
mere
machine
set
in
motion
for
the
amusement
of
its
manufacturer
placed
somewhere
outside
of
it
so
it
is
that
truths
hang
together
and
mutually
advance
and
complete
one
another
whereas
error
gets
jostled
at
every
corner
what
kind
of
influence
it
is
that
may
exercise
on
conduct
and
what
are
the
limits
of
that
influence
are
questions
which
i
have
sufficiently
examined
in
the
twentieth
section
of
my
treatise
on
the
of
in
all
essential
particulars
an
analogous
influence
is
exercised
by
which
however
has
a
more
powerful
effect
than
doctrine
and
therefore
it
deserves
a
brief
analysis
in
the
main
example
works
either
by
restraining
a
man
or
by
encouraging
him
it
has
the
former
effect
when
it
determines
him
to
leave
undone
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
sees
i
mean
that
other
people
do
not
do
it
and
from
this
he
judges
in
general
that
it
is
not
expedient
that
it
may
endanger
his
person
or
his
property
or
his
honour
he
rests
content
and
gladly
finds
himself
relieved
from
examining
into
the
matter
for
himself
or
he
may
see
that
another
man
who
has
not
refrained
has
incurred
evil
consequences
from
doing
it
this
is
example
of
the
deterrent
kind
the
example
which
encourages
a
man
works
in
a
twofold
manner
it
either
induces
him
to
do
what
he
would
be
glad
to
leave
undone
if
he
were
not
afraid
lest
the
omission
might
in
some
way
endanger
him
or
injure
him
in
others
opinion
or
else
it
encourages
him
to
do
what
he
is
glad
to
do
but
has
hitherto
refrained
from
doing
from
fear
of
danger
or
shame
this
is
example
of
the
seductive
kind
finally
example
may
bring
a
man
to
do
what
he
would
have
otherwise
never
thought
of
doing
it
is
obvious
that
in
this
last
case
example
works
in
the
main
only
on
the
intellect
its
effect
on
the
will
is
secondary
and
if
it
has
any
such
effect
it
is
by
the
interposition
of
the
man
own
judgment
or
by
reliance
on
the
person
who
presented
the
example
the
whole
influence
of
example
and
it
is
very
strong
rests
on
the
fact
that
a
man
has
as
a
rule
too
little
judgment
of
his
own
and
often
too
little
knowledge
o
explore
his
own
way
for
himself
and
that
he
is
glad
therefore
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
some
one
else
accordingly
the
more
deficient
he
is
in
either
of
these
qualities
the
more
is
he
open
to
the
influence
of
example
and
we
find
in
fact
that
most
men
guiding
star
is
the
example
of
others
that
their
whole
course
of
life
in
great
things
and
in
small
comes
in
the
end
to
be
mere
imitation
and
that
not
even
in
the
pettiest
matters
do
they
act
according
to
their
own
judgment
imitation
and
custom
are
the
spring
of
almost
all
human
action
the
cause
of
it
is
that
men
fight
shy
of
all
and
any
sort
of
reflection
and
very
properly
mistrust
their
own
discernment
at
the
same
time
this
remarkably
strong
imitative
instinct
in
man
is
a
proof
of
his
kinship
with
apes
but
the
kind
of
effect
which
example
exercises
depends
upon
a
character
and
thus
it
is
that
the
same
example
may
possibly
seduce
one
man
and
deter
another
an
easy
opportunity
of
observing
this
is
afforded
in
the
case
of
certain
social
impertinences
which
come
into
vogue
and
gradually
spread
the
first
time
that
a
man
notices
anything
of
the
kind
he
may
say
to
himself
shame
how
can
he
do
it
how
selfish
and
inconsiderate
of
him
really
i
shall
take
care
never
to
do
anything
like
but
twenty
others
will
think
if
he
does
that
i
may
do
it
as
regards
morality
example
like
doctrine
may
it
is
true
promote
civil
or
legal
amelioration
but
not
that
inward
amendment
which
is
strictly
speaking
the
only
kind
of
moral
amelioration
for
example
always
works
as
a
personal
motive
alone
and
assumes
therefore
that
a
man
is
susceptible
to
this
sort
of
motive
but
it
is
just
the
predominating
sensitiveness
of
a
character
to
this
or
that
sort
of
motive
that
determines
whether
its
morality
is
true
and
real
though
of
whatever
kind
it
is
it
is
always
innate
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
example
operates
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
good
and
the
bad
qualities
of
a
character
but
it
does
not
create
them
and
so
it
is
that
seneca
maxim
non
can
not
be
also
holds
good
here
but
the
innateness
of
all
truly
moral
qualities
of
the
good
as
of
the
bad
is
a
doctrine
that
consorts
better
with
the
metempsychosis
of
the
brahmins
and
buddhists
according
to
which
a
man
good
and
bad
deeds
follow
him
from
one
existence
to
another
like
his
shadow
than
with
judaism
for
judaism
requires
a
man
to
come
into
the
world
as
a
moral
blank
so
that
in
virtue
of
an
inconceivable
free
will
directed
to
objects
which
are
neither
to
be
sought
nor
avoided
arbitrium
and
consequently
as
the
result
of
reasoned
consideration
he
may
choose
whether
he
is
to
be
an
angel
or
a
devil
or
anything
else
that
may
lie
between
the
two
though
i
am
well
aware
what
the
jewish
scheme
is
i
pay
no
attention
to
it
for
my
standard
is
truth
i
am
no
professor
of
philosophy
and
therefore
i
do
not
find
my
vocation
in
establishing
the
fundamental
ideas
of
judaism
at
any
cost
even
though
they
for
ever
bar
the
way
to
all
and
every
kind
of
philosophical
knowledge
arbitrium
under
the
name
of
is
a
charming
doll
for
professors
of
philosophy
to
dandle
and
we
must
leave
it
to
those
intelligent
honourable
and
upright
gentlemen
character
men
who
aspire
to
a
happy
a
brilliant
and
a
long
life
instead
of
to
a
virtuous
one
are
like
foolish
actors
who
want
to
be
always
having
the
great
parts
the
parts
that
are
marked
by
splendour
and
triumph
they
fail
to
see
that
the
important
thing
is
not
or
but
they
act
since
man
does
not
and
his
remains
absolutely
the
same
all
through
his
life
since
he
must
play
out
the
part
which
he
has
received
without
the
least
deviation
from
the
character
since
neither
experience
nor
philosophy
nor
religion
can
effect
any
improvement
in
him
the
question
arises
what
is
the
meaning
of
life
at
all
to
what
purpose
is
it
played
this
farce
in
which
everything
that
is
essential
is
irrevocably
fixed
and
determined
it
is
played
that
a
man
may
come
to
understand
himself
that
he
may
see
what
it
is
that
he
seeks
and
has
sought
to
be
what
he
wants
and
what
therefore
he
is
is
a
knowledge
which
must
be
imparted
to
him
from
life
is
to
man
in
other
words
to
will
what
chemical
are
to
the
body
it
is
only
by
life
that
a
man
reveals
what
he
is
and
it
is
only
in
so
far
as
he
reveals
himself
that
he
exists
at
all
life
is
the
manifestation
of
character
of
the
something
that
we
understand
by
that
word
and
it
is
not
in
life
but
outside
of
it
and
outside
time
that
character
undergoes
alteration
as
a
result
of
the
which
life
gives
life
is
only
the
mirror
into
which
a
man
gazes
not
in
order
that
he
may
get
a
reflection
of
himself
but
that
he
may
come
to
understand
himself
by
that
reflection
that
he
may
see
it
is
that
the
mirror
shows
life
is
the
proof
sheet
in
which
the
compositors
errors
are
brought
to
light
how
they
become
visible
and
whether
the
type
is
large
or
small
are
matters
of
no
consequence
neither
in
the
externals
of
life
nor
in
the
course
of
history
is
there
any
significance
for
as
it
is
all
one
whether
an
error
occurs
in
the
large
type
or
in
the
small
so
it
is
all
one
as
regards
the
essence
of
the
matter
whether
an
evil
disposition
is
mirrored
as
a
conqueror
of
the
world
or
a
common
swindler
or
egoist
in
one
case
he
is
seen
of
all
men
in
the
other
perhaps
only
of
himself
but
that
he
should
see
himself
is
what
signifies
therefore
if
egoism
has
a
firm
hold
of
a
man
and
masters
him
whether
it
be
in
the
form
of
joy
or
triumph
or
lust
or
hope
or
frantic
grief
or
annoyance
or
anger
or
fear
or
suspicion
or
passion
of
any
kind
he
is
in
the
devil
clutches
and
how
he
got
into
them
does
not
matter
what
is
needful
is
that
he
should
make
haste
to
get
out
of
them
and
here
again
it
does
not
matter
how
i
have
described
as
an
act
of
will
lying
beyond
time
of
which
life
in
time
or
in
is
the
development
for
matters
of
practical
life
we
all
possess
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
for
we
are
constituted
of
them
both
character
modifies
our
life
more
than
we
think
and
it
is
to
a
certain
extent
true
that
every
man
is
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
no
doubt
it
seems
as
if
our
lot
were
assigned
to
us
almost
entirely
from
without
and
imparted
to
us
in
something
of
the
same
way
in
which
a
melody
outside
us
reaches
the
ear
but
on
looking
back
over
our
past
we
see
at
once
that
our
life
consists
of
mere
variations
on
one
and
the
same
theme
namely
our
character
and
that
the
same
fundamental
bass
sounds
through
it
all
this
is
an
experience
which
a
man
can
and
must
make
in
and
by
himself
not
only
a
man
life
but
his
intellect
too
may
be
possessed
of
a
clear
and
definite
character
so
far
as
his
intellect
is
applied
to
matters
of
theory
it
is
not
every
man
however
who
has
an
intellect
of
this
kind
for
any
such
definite
individuality
as
i
mean
is
genius
an
original
view
of
the
world
which
presupposes
an
absolutely
exceptional
individuality
which
is
the
essence
of
genius
a
intellectual
character
is
the
theme
on
which
all
his
works
are
variations
in
an
essay
which
i
wrote
in
weimar
i
called
it
the
knack
by
which
every
genius
produces
his
works
however
various
this
intellectual
character
determines
the
physiognomy
of
men
of
genius
what
i
might
call
theoretical
and
gives
it
that
distinguished
expression
which
is
chiefly
seen
in
the
eyes
and
the
forehead
in
the
case
of
ordinary
men
the
physiognomy
presents
no
more
than
a
weak
analogy
with
the
physiognomy
of
genius
on
the
other
hand
all
men
possess
practical
the
stamp
of
will
of
practical
character
of
moral
disposition
and
it
shows
itself
chiefly
in
the
mouth
since
character
so
far
as
we
understand
its
nature
is
above
and
beyond
time
it
can
not
undergo
any
change
under
the
influence
of
life
but
although
it
must
necessarily
remain
the
same
always
it
requires
time
to
unfold
itself
and
show
the
very
diverse
aspects
which
it
may
possess
for
character
consists
of
two
factors
one
the
itself
blind
impulse
impetuosity
the
other
the
restraint
which
the
will
acquires
when
it
comes
to
understand
the
world
and
the
world
again
is
itself
will
a
man
may
begin
by
following
the
craving
of
desire
until
he
comes
to
see
how
hollow
and
unreal
a
thing
is
life
how
deceitful
are
its
pleasures
what
horrible
aspects
it
possesses
and
this
it
is
that
makes
people
hermits
penitents
magdalenes
nevertheless
it
is
to
be
observed
that
no
such
change
from
a
life
of
great
indulgence
in
pleasure
to
one
of
resignation
is
possible
except
to
the
man
who
of
his
own
accord
renounces
pleasure
a
really
bad
life
can
not
be
changed
into
a
virtuous
one
the
most
beautiful
soul
before
it
comes
to
know
life
from
its
horrible
side
may
eagerly
drink
the
sweets
of
life
and
remain
innocent
but
it
can
not
commit
a
bad
action
it
can
not
cause
others
suffering
to
do
a
pleasure
to
itself
for
in
that
case
it
would
see
clearly
what
it
would
be
doing
and
whatever
be
its
youth
and
inexperience
it
perceives
the
sufferings
of
others
as
clearly
as
its
own
pleasures
that
is
why
one
bad
action
is
a
guarantee
that
numberless
others
will
be
committed
as
soon
as
circumstances
give
occasion
for
them
somebody
once
remarked
to
me
with
entire
justice
that
every
man
had
something
very
good
and
humane
in
his
disposition
and
also
something
very
bad
and
malignant
and
that
according
as
he
was
moved
one
or
the
other
of
them
made
its
appearance
the
sight
of
others
suffering
arouses
not
only
in
different
men
but
in
one
and
the
same
man
at
one
moment
an
inexhaustible
sympathy
at
another
a
certain
satisfaction
and
this
satisfaction
may
increase
until
it
becomes
the
cruellest
delight
in
pain
i
observe
in
myself
that
at
one
moment
i
regard
all
mankind
with
heartfelt
pity
at
another
with
the
greatest
indifference
on
occasion
with
hatred
nay
with
a
positive
enjoyment
of
their
pain
all
this
shows
very
clearly
that
we
are
possessed
of
two
different
nay
absolutely
contradictory
ways
of
regarding
the
world
one
according
to
the
principle
of
individuation
which
exhibits
all
creatures
as
entire
strangers
to
us
as
definitely
not
ourselves
we
can
have
no
feelings
for
them
but
those
of
indifference
envy
hatred
and
delight
that
they
suffer
the
other
way
of
regarding
the
world
is
in
accordance
with
what
i
may
call
the
principle
all
creatures
are
exhibited
as
identical
with
ourselves
and
so
it
is
pity
and
love
which
the
sight
of
them
arouses
the
one
method
separates
individuals
by
impassable
barriers
the
other
removes
the
barrier
and
brings
the
individuals
together
the
one
makes
us
feel
in
regard
to
every
man
is
what
i
the
other
is
not
what
i
but
it
is
remarkable
that
while
the
sight
of
another
suffering
makes
us
feel
our
identity
with
him
and
arouses
our
pity
this
is
not
so
with
the
sight
of
another
happiness
then
we
almost
always
feel
some
envy
and
even
though
we
may
have
no
such
feeling
in
certain
cases
as
for
instance
when
our
friends
are
happy
yet
the
interest
which
we
take
in
their
happiness
is
of
a
weak
description
and
can
not
compare
with
the
sympathy
which
we
feel
with
their
suffering
is
this
because
we
recognise
all
happiness
to
be
a
delusion
or
an
impediment
to
true
welfare
no
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
because
the
sight
of
the
pleasure
or
the
possessions
which
are
denied
to
us
arouses
envy
that
is
to
say
the
wish
that
we
and
not
the
other
had
that
pleasure
or
those
possessions
it
is
only
the
first
way
of
looking
at
the
world
which
is
founded
on
any
demonstrable
reason
the
other
is
as
it
were
the
gate
out
of
this
world
it
has
no
attestation
beyond
itself
unless
it
be
the
very
abstract
and
difficult
proof
which
my
doctrine
supplies
why
the
first
way
predominates
in
one
man
and
the
second
in
another
though
perhaps
it
does
not
exclusively
predominate
in
any
man
why
the
one
or
the
other
emerges
according
as
the
will
is
moved
these
are
deep
problems
the
paths
of
night
and
day
are
close
together

it
is
a
fact
that
there
is
a
great
and
original
difference
between
one
empirical
character
and
another
and
it
is
a
difference
which
at
bottom
rests
upon
the
relation
of
the
individual
will
to
his
intellectual
faculty
this
relation
is
finally
determined
by
the
degree
of
will
in
his
father
and
of
intellect
in
his
mother
and
the
union
of
father
and
mother
is
for
the
most
part
an
affair
of
chance
this
would
all
mean
a
revolting
injustice
in
the
nature
of
the
world
if
it
were
not
that
the
difference
between
parents
and

is

and
all

is

as
regards
the
freedom
of
the
will
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
will
manifested
itself
in
a
single
act
alone
it
would
be
a
free
act
but
the
will
manifests
itself
in
a
course
of
life
that
is
to
say
in
a
series
of
acts
every
one
of
these
acts
therefore
is
determined
as
a
part
of
a
complete
whole
and
can
not
happen
otherwise
than
it
does
happen
on
the
other
hand
the
whole
series
is
free
it
is
simply
the
manifestation
of
an
individualised
will
if
a
man
feels
inclined
to
commit
a
bad
action
and
refrains
he
is
kept
back
either
by
fear
of
punishment
or
vengeance
or
by
superstition
in
other
words
fear
of
punishment
in
a
future
life
or
by
the
feeling
of
sympathy
including
general
charity
or
by
the
feeling
of
honour
in
other
words
the
fear
of
shame
or
by
the
feeling
of
justice
that
is
an
objective
attachment
to
fidelity
and
coupled
with
a
resolve
to
hold
them
sacred
because
they
are
the
foundation
of
all
free
intercourse
between
man
and
man
and

to
himself

last

this
that
often

a
man
of
honour
when
some
great
but
unjust
advantage
is
offered
him
to
reject
it
with
contempt
and
proudly
exclaim
am
an
honourable
for
otherwise
how
should
a
poor
man
confronted
with
the
property
which
chance
or
even
some
worse
agency
has
bestowed
on
the
rich
whose
very
existence
it
is
that
makes
him
poor
feel
so
much
sincere
respect
for
this
property
that
he
refuses
to
touch
it
even
in
his
need
and
although
he
has
a
prospect
of
escaping
punishment
what
other
thought
is
it
that
can
be
at
the
bottom
of
such
a
man
honesty
he
is
resolved
not
to
separate
himself
from
the
great
community
of
honourable
people
who
have
the
earth
in
possession
and
whose
laws
are
recognised
everywhere
he
knows
that
a
single
dishonest
act
will
ostracise
and
proscribe
him
from
that
society
for
ever
no
a
man
will
spend
money
on
any
soil
that
yields
him
good
fruit
and
he
will
make
sacrifices
for
it
with
a
good
action
that
every
action
in
which
a
man
own
advantage
is
ostensibly
subordinated
to
another
the
motive
is
either
kept
in
the
background
or
superstition
in
other
words
in
the
form
of
reward
in
another

or
sympathy
or

to
lend
a

attachment
to
the
maxim

should
assist

another

maintain

of
the

duty
and
for
the
sake
of
duty
there
is
as
will
be
seen
no
room
at
all
kant
himself
declares
it
to
be
doubtful
whether
an
action
was
ever
determined
by
pure
motives
of
duty
alone
i
affirm
most
certainly
that
no
action
was
ever
so
done
it
is
mere
babble
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
could
really
act
as
a
motive
to
any
man
when
he
shelters
himself
behind
verbiage
of
that
sort
he
is
always
actuated
by
one
of
the
four
motives
which
i
have
described
among
these
it
is
obviously
sympathy
alone
which
is
quite
genuine
and
sincere
and
apply
to
character
only
that
is
to
say
we
prefer
the
good
to
the
bad
but
absolutely
there
is
no
such
distinction
the
difference
arises
at
the
point
which
lies
between
subordinating
one
own
advantage
to
that
of
another
and
not
subordinating
it
if
a
man
keeps
to
the
exact
middle
he
is
but
most
men
go
an
inch
in
their
regard
for
others
welfare
to
twenty
yards
in
regard
for
their
own
the
source
of
and
of
so
far
as
we
have
any
real
knowledge
of
it
lies
in
this
that
with
the
bad
character
the
thought
of
the
external
world
and
especially
of
the
living
creatures
in
it
is
accompanied
all
the
more
the
greater
the
resemblance
between
them
and
the
individual
self
by
a
constant
feeling
of
i
not
i
not
contrarily
with
the
good
character
both
being
assumed
to
exist
in
a
high
degree
the
same
thought
has
for
its
accompaniment
like
a
fundamental
bass
a
constant
feeling
of
i
from
this
spring
benevolence
and
a
disposition
to
help
all
men
and
at
the
same
time
a
cheerful
confident
and
tranquil
frame
of
mind
the
opposite
of
that
which
accompanies
the
bad
character
the
difference
however
is
only
phenomenal
although
it
is
a
difference
which
is
radical
but
now
we
come
to
hardest
of
all
how
is
it
that
while
the
will
as
the
is
identical
and
from
a
metaphysical
point
of
view
one
and
the
same
in
all
its
manifestations
there
is
nevertheless
such
an
enormous
difference
between
one
character
and
another
the
malicious
diabolical
wickedness
of
the
one
and
set
off
against
it
the
goodness
of
the
other
showing
all
the
more
conspicuously
how
is
it
that
we
get
a
tiberius
a
caligula
a
carcalla
a
domitian
a
nero
and
on
the
other
hand
the
antonines
titus
hadrian
nerva
how
is
it
that
among
the
animals
nay
in
a
higher
species
in
individual
animals
there
is
a
like
difference
the
malignity
of
the
cat
most
strongly
developed
in
the
tiger
the
spite
of
the
monkey
on
the
other
hand
goodness
fidelity
and
love
in
the
dog
and
the
elephant
it
is
obvious
that
the
principle
of
wickedness
in
the
brute
is
the
same
as
in
man
we
may
to
some
extent
modify
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
by
observing
that
the
whole
difference
is
in
the
end
only
one
of
degree
in
every
living
creature
the
fundamental
propensities
and
instincts
all
exist
but
they
exist
in
very
different
degrees
and
proportions
this
however
is
not
enough
to
explain
the
facts
we
must
fall
back
upon
the
intellect
and
its
relation
to
the
will
it
is
the
only
explanation
that
remains
a
man
intellect
however
by
no
means
stands
in
any
direct
and
obvious
relation
with
the
goodness
of
his
character
we
may
it
is
true
discriminate
between
two
kinds
of
intellect
between
understanding
as
the
apprehension
of
relation
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
and
cognition
a
faculty
akin
to
genius
which
acts
more
directly
is
independent
of
this
law
and
passes
beyond
the
principle
of
individuation
the
latter
is
the
faculty
which
apprehends
ideas
and
it
is
the
faculty
which
has
to
do
with
morality
but
even
this
explanation
leaves
much
to
be
desired
minds
are
seldom
fine
was
the
correct
observation
of
jean
paul
although
they
are
never
the
contrary
lord
bacon
who
to
be
sure
was
less
a
fine
soul
than
a
fine
mind
was
a
scoundrel
i
have
declared
space
and
time
to
be
part
of
the
principle
of
individuation
as
it
is
only
space
and
time
that
make
the
multiplicity
of
similar
objects
a
possibility
but
multiplicity
itself
also
admits
of
variety
multiplicity
and
diversity
are
not
only
quantitative
but
also
qualitative
how
is
it
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
qualitative
diversity
especially
in
ethical
matters
or
have
i
fallen
into
an
error
the
opposite
of
that
in
which
leibnitz
fell
with
his
the
chief
cause
of
intellectual
diversity
is
to
be
found
in
the
brain
and
nervous
system
this
is
a
fact
which
somewhat
lessens
the
obscurity
of
the
subject
with
the
brutes
the
intellect
and
the
brain
are
strictly
adapted
to
their
aims
and
needs
with
man
alone
there
is
now
and
then
by
way
of
exception
a
superfluity
which
if
it
is
abundant
may
yield
genius
but
ethical
diversity
it
seems
proceeds
immediately
from
the
will
otherwise
ethical
character
would
not
be
above
and
beyond
time
as
it
is
only
in
the
individual
that
intellect
and
will
are
united
the
will
is
above
and
beyond
time
and
eternal
and
character
is
innate
that
is
to
say
it
is
sprung
from
the
same
eternity
and
therefore
it
does
not
admit
of
any
but
a
transcendental
explanation
perhaps
some
one
will
come
after
me
who
will
throw
light
into
this
dark
abyss
moral
instinct
an
act
done
by
instinct
differs
from
every
other
kind
of
act
in
that
an
understanding
of
its
object
does
not
precede
it
but
follows
upon
it
instinct
is
therefore
a
rule
of
action
given
we
may
be
unaware
of
the
object
to
which
it
is
directed
as
no
understanding
of
it
is
necessary
to
its
attainment
on
the
other
hand
if
an
act
is
done
by
an
exercise
of
reason
or
intelligence
it
proceeds
according
to
a
rule
which
the
understanding
has
itself
devised
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
a
preconceived
aim
hence
it
is
that
action
according
to
rule
may
miss
its
aim
while
instinct
is
infallible
on
the
character
of
instinct
we
may
compare
what
plato
says
in
the
with
plato
instinct
is
a
reminiscence
of
something
which
a
man
has
never
actually
experienced
in
his
lifetime
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
and
elsewhere
everything
that
a
man
learns
is
regarded
as
a
reminiscence
he
has
no
other
word
to
express
the
element
in
all
experience
there
are
then
three
things
that
are
theoretical
reason
in
other
words
the
conditions
which
make
all
experience
possible
instinct
or
the
rule
by
which
an
object
promoting
the
life
of
the
senses
may
though
unknown
be
attained
the
moral
law
or
the
rule
by
which
an
action
takes
place
without
any
object
accordingly
rational
or
intelligent
action
proceeds
by
a
rule
laid
down
in
accordance
with
the
object
as
it
is
understood
instinctive
action
proceeds
by
a
rule
without
an
understanding
of
the
object
of
it
moral
action
proceeds
by
a
rule
without
any
object
at
all
is
the
aggregate
of
rules
in
accordance
with
which
all
my
knowledge
that
is
to
say
the
whole
world
of
experience
necessarily
proceeds
in
the
same
manner
is
the
aggregate
of
rules
in
accordance
with
which
all
my
action
necessarily
proceeds
if
it
meets
with
no
obstruction
hence
it
seems
to
me
that
instinct
may
most
appropriately
be
called
for
like
theoretical
reason
it
determines
the
of
all
experience
the
moral
law
on
the
other
hand
is
only
one
aspect
of
better
the
aspect
which
it
presents
from
the
point
of
view
of
instinct
this
better
consciousness
is
something
lying
beyond
all
experience
that
is
beyond
all
reason
whether
of
the
theoretical
or
the
practical
kind
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
whilst
it
is
in
virtue
of
the
mysterious
union
of
it
and
reason
in
the
same
individual
that
the
better
consciousness
comes
into
conflict
with
reason
leaving
the
individual
to
choose
between
the
two
in
any
conflict
between
the
better
consciousness
and
reason
if
the
individual
decides
for
reason
should
it
be
theoretical
reason
he
becomes
a
narrow
pedantic
philistine
should
it
be
practical
a
rascal
if
he
decides
for
the
better
consciousness
we
can
make
no
further
positive
affirmation
about
him
for
if
we
were
to
do
so
we
should
find
ourselves
in
the
realm
of
reason
and
as
it
is
only
what
takes
place
within
this
realm
that
we
can
speak
of
at
all
it
follows
that
we
can
not
speak
of
the
better
consciousness
except
in
negative
terms
this
shows
us
how
it
is
that
reason
is
hindered
and
obstructed
that
is
suppressed
in
favour
of
and
in
favour
of
now
the
better
consciousness
is
neither
theoretical
nor
practical
for
these
are
distinctions
that
only
apply
to
reason
but
if
the
individual
is
in
the
act
of
choosing
the
better
consciousness
appears
to
him
in
the
aspect
which
it
assumes
in
vanquishing
and
overcoming
the
practical
reason
or
instinct
to
use
the
common
word
it
appears
to
him
as
an
imperative
command
an
it
so
appears
to
him
i
say
in
other
words
that
is
the
shape
which
it
takes
for
the
theoretical
reason
which
renders
all
things
into
objects
and
ideas
but
in
so
far
as
the
better
consciousness
desires
to
vanquish
and
overcome
the
theoretical
reason
it
takes
no
shape
at
all
on
the
simple
ground
that
as
it
comes
into
play
the
theoretical
reason
is
suppressed
and
becomes
the
mere
servant
of
the
better
consciousness
that
is
why
genius
can
never
give
any
account
of
its
own
works
in
the
morality
of
action
the
legal
principle
that
both
sides
are
to
be
heard
must
not
be
allowed
to
apply
in
other
words
the
claims
of
self
and
the
senses
must
not
be
urged
nay
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
the
pure
will
has
found
expression
the
case
is
closed
audienda
altera
the
lower
animals
are
not
endowed
with
moral
freedom
probably
this
is
not
because
they
show
no
trace
of
the
better
consciousness
which
in
us
is
manifested
as
morality
or
nothing
analogous
to
it
for
if
that
were
so
the
lower
animals
which
are
in
so
many
respects
like
ourselves
in
outward
appearance
that
we
regard
man
as
a
species
of
animal
would
possess
some
entirely
different
from
our
own
and
actually
be
in
their
essential
and
inmost
nature
something
quite
other
than
ourselves
this
is
a
contention
which
is
obviously
refuted
by
the
thoroughly
malignant
and
inherently
vicious
character
of
certain
animals
such
as
the
crocodile
the
hyaena
the
scorpion
the
snake
and
the
gentle
affectionate
and
contented
character
of
others
such
as
the
dog
here
as
in
the
case
of
men
the
character
as
it
is
manifested
must
rest
upon
something
that
is
above
and
beyond
time
for
as
jacob
böhme
says
is
a
power
in
every
animal
which
is
indestructible
and
the
spirit
of
the
world
draws
it
into
itself
against
the
final
separation
at
the
last
therefore
we
can
not
call
the
lower
animals
free
and
the
reason
why
we
can
not
do
so
is
that
they
are
wanting
in
a
faculty
which
is
profoundly
subordinate
to
the
better
consciousness
in
its
highest
phase
i
mean
reason
reason
is
the
faculty
of
supreme
comprehension
the
idea
of
totality
how
reason
manifests
itself
in
the
theoretical
sphere
kant
has
shown
and
it
does
the
same
in
the
practical
it
makes
us
capable
of
observing
and
surveying
the
whole
of
our
life
thought
and
action
in
continual
connection
and
therefore
of
acting
according
to
general
maxims
whether
those
maxims
originate
in
the
understanding
as
prudential
rules
or
in
the
better
consciousness
as
moral
laws
footnote
if
any
desire
or
passion
is
aroused
in
us
we
and
in
the
same
way
the
lower
animals
are
for
the
moment
filled
with
this
desire
we
are
all
anger
all
lust
all
fear
and
in
such
moments
neither
the
better
consciousness
can
speak
nor
the
understanding
consider
the
consequences
but
in
our
case
reason
allows
us
even
at
that
moment
to
see
our
actions
and
our
life
as
an
unbroken
chain
a
chain
which
connects
our
earlier
resolutions
or
it
may
be
the
future
consequences
of
our
action
with
the
moment
of
passion
which
now
fills
our
whole
consciousness
it
shows
us
the
identity
of
our
person
even
when
that
person
is
exposed
to
influences
of
the
most
varied
kind
and
thereby
we
are
enabled
to
act
according
to
maxims
the
lower
animal
is
wanting
in
this
faculty
the
passion
which
seizes
it
completely
dominates
it
and
can
be
checked
only
by
another
passion
anger
for
instance
or
lust
by
fear
even
though
the
vision
that
terrifies
does
not
appeal
to
the
senses
but
is
present
in
the
animal
only
as
a
dim
memory
and
imagination
men
therefore
may
be
called
irrational
if
like
the
lower
animals
they
allow
themselves
to
be
determined
by
the
moment
so
far
however
is
reason
from
being
the
source
of
morality
that
it
is
reason
alone
which
makes
us
capable
of
being
rascals
which
the
lower
animals
can
not
be
it
is
reason
which
enables
us
to
form
an
evil
resolution
and
to
keep
it
when
the
provocation
to
evil
is
removed
it
enables
us
for
example
to
nurse
vengeance
although
at
the
moment
that
we
have
an
opportunity
of
fulfilling
our
resolution
the
better
consciousness
may
manifest
itself
as
love
or
charity
it
is
by
force
of
reason
in
pursuance
of
some
evil
maxim
that
we
act
against
it
thus
goethe
says
that
a
man
may
use
his
reason
only
for
the
purpose
of
being
more
bestial
than
any
beast
hat
vernunft
doch
braucht
er
sie
allein
um
theirischer
als
jedes
thier
zu
for
not
only
do
we
like
the
beasts
satisfy
the
desires
of
the
moment
but
we
refine
upon
them
and
stimulate
them
in
order
to
prepare
the
desire
for
the
satisfaction
whenever
we
think
that
we
perceive
a
trace
of
reason
in
the
lower
animals
it
fills
us
with
surprise
now
our
surprise
is
not
excited
by
the
good
and
affectionate
disposition
which
some
of
them
exhibit
we
recognise
that
as
something
other
than
reason
but
by
some
action
in
them
which
seems
to
be
determined
not
by
the
impression
of
the
moment
but
by
a
resolution
previously
made
and
kept
elephants
for
instance
are
reported
to
have
taken
premeditated
revenge
for
insults
long
after
they
were
suffered
lions
to
have
requited
benefits
on
an
opportunity
tardily
offered
the
truth
of
such
stories
has
however
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
question
what
do
we
mean
by
reason
but
they
enable
us
to
decide
whether
in
the
lower
animals
there
is
any
trace
of
anything
that
we
can
call
reason
kant
not
only
declares
that
all
our
moral
sentiments
originate
in
reason
but
he
lays
down
that
reason
my
sense
of
the
is
a
condition
of
moral
action
as
he
holds
that
for
an
action
to
be
virtuous
and
meritorious
it
must
be
done
in
accordance
with
maxims
and
not
spring
from
a
resolve
taken
under
some
momentary
impression
but
in
both
contentions
he
is
wrong
if
i
resolve
to
take
vengeance
on
some
one
and
when
an
opportunity
offers
the
better
consciousness
in
the
form
of
love
and
humanity
speaks
its
word
and
i
am
influenced
by
it
rather
than
by
my
evil
resolution
this
is
a
virtuous
act
for
it
is
a
manifestation
of
the
better
consciousness
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
a
very
virtuous
man
in
whom
the
better
consciousness
is
so
continuously
active
that
it
is
never
silent
and
never
allows
his
passions
to
get
a
complete
hold
of
him
by
such
consciousness
he
is
subject
to
a
direct
control
instead
of
being
guided
indirectly
through
the
medium
of
reason
by
means
of
maxims
and
moral
principles
that
is
why
a
man
may
have
weak
reasoning
powers
and
a
weak
understanding
and
yet
have
a
high
sense
of
morality
and
be
eminently
good
for
the
most
important
element
in
a
man
depends
as
little
on
intellectual
as
it
does
on
physical
strength

ethical
reflections
the
philosophers
of
the
ancient
world
united
in
a
single
conception
a
great
many
things
that
had
no
connection
with
one
another
of
this
every
dialogue
of
plato
furnishes
abundant
examples
the
greatest
and
worst
confusion
of
this
kind
is
that
between
ethics
and
politics
the
state
and
the
kingdom
of
god
or
the
moral
law
are
so
entirely
different
in
their
character
that
the
former
is
a
parody
of
the
latter
a
bitter
mockery
at
the
absence
of
it
compared
with
the
moral
law
the
state
is
a
crutch
instead
of
a
limb
an
automaton
instead
of
a
man
the
of
stands
in
close
connection
with
human
freedom
it
is
as
it
were
an
abuse
of
that
freedom
instead
of
using
his
freedom
to
fulfil
the
moral
law
a
man
employs
his
power
of
voluntarily
undergoing
any
feeling
of
pain
of
overcoming
any
momentary
impression
in
order
that
he
may
assert
his
whatever
be
the
object
to
which
he
directs
it
as
he
thereby
shows
that
unlike
the
lower
animals
he
has
thoughts
which
go
beyond
the
welfare
of
his
body
and
whatever
makes
for
that
welfare
it
has
come
about
that
the
principle
of
honour
is
often
confused
with
virtue
they
are
regarded
as
if
they
were
twins
but
wrongly
for
although
the
principle
of
honour
is
something
which
distinguishes
man
from
the
lower
animals
it
is
not
in
itself
anything
that
raises
him
above
them
taken
as
an
end
and
aim
it
is
as
dark
a
delusion
as
any
other
aim
that
springs
from
self
used
as
a
means
or
casually
it
may
be
productive
of
good
but
even
that
is
good
which
is
vain
and
frivolous
it
is
the
misuse
of
freedom
the
employment
of
it
as
a
weapon
for
overcoming
the
world
of
feeling
that
makes
man
so
infinitely
more
terrible
than
the
lower
animals
for
they
do
only
what
momentary
instinct
bids
them
while
man
acts
by
ideas
and
his
ideas
may
entail
universal
ruin
before
they
are
satisfied
there
is
another
circumstance
which
helps
to
promote
the
notion
that
honour
and
virtue
are
connected
a
man
who
can
do
what
he
wants
to
do
shows
that
he
can
also
do
it
if
what
he
wants
to
do
is
a
virtuous
act
but
that
those
of
our
actions
which
we
are
ourselves
obliged
to
regard
with
contempt
are
also
regarded
with
contempt
by
other
people
serves
more
than
anything
that
i
have
here
mentioned
to
establish
the
connection
thus
it
often
happens
that
a
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
the
one
kind
of
contempt
is
unwilling
to
undergo
the
other
but
when
we
are
called
upon
to
choose
between
our
own
approval
and
the
censure
as
may
occur
in
complicated
and
mistaken
circumstances
what
becomes
of
the
principle
of
honour
then
two
characteristic
examples
of
the
principle
of
honour
are
to
be
found
in
shakespeare
part
act
sc
a
pirate
is
anxious
to
murder
his
captive
instead
of
accepting
like
others
a
ransom
for
him
because
in
taking
his
captive
he
lost
an
eye
and
his
own
honour
and
that
of
his
forefathers
would
in
his
opinion
be
stained
if
he
were
to
allow
his
revenge
to
be
bought
off
as
though
he
were
a
mere
trader
the
prisoner
on
the
other
hand
who
is
the
duke
of
suffolk
prefers
to
have
his
head
grace
a
pole
than
to
uncover
it
to
such
a
low
fellow
as
a
pirate
by
approaching
him
to
ask
for
mercy
just
as
civic
honour
in
other
words
the
opinion
that
we
deserve
to
be
trusted
is
the
palladium
of
those
whose
endeavour
it
is
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
on
the
path
of
honourable
business
so
knightly
honour
in
other
words
the
opinion
that
we
are
men
to
be
feared
is
the
palladium
of
those
who
aim
at
going
through
life
on
the
path
of
violence
and
so
it
was
that
knightly
honour
arose
among
the
and
other
knights
of
the
middle
ages
a
theoretical
philosopher
is
one
who
can
supply
in
the
shape
of
ideas
for
the
reason
a
copy
of
the
presentations
of
experience
just
as
what
the
painter
sees
he
can
reproduce
on
canvas
the
sculptor
in
marble
the
poet
in
pictures
for
the
imagination
though
they
are
pictures
which
he
supplies
only
in
sowing
the
ideas
from
which
they
sprang
a
practical
philosopher
on
the
other
hand
is
one
who
contrarily
deduces
his
action
from
ideas
the
theoretical
philosopher
transforms
life
into
ideas
the
practical
philosopher
transforms
ideas
into
life
he
acts
therefore
in
a
thoroughly
reasonable
manner
he
is
consistent
regular
deliberate
he
is
never
hasty
or
passionate
he
never
allows
himself
to
be
influenced
by
the
impression
of
the
moment
and
indeed
when
we
find
ourselves
among
those
full
presentations
of
experience
or
real
objects
to
which
the
body
belongs
since
the
body
is
only
an
objectified
will
the
shape
which
the
will
assumes
in
the
material
world
it
is
difficult
to
let
our
bodies
be
guided
not
by
those
presentations
but
by
a
mere
image
of
them
by
cold
colourless
ideas
which
are
related
to
experience
as
the
shadow
of
orcus
to
life
and
yet
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
avoid
doing
things
of
which
we
may
have
to
repent
the
theoretical
philosopher
enriches
the
domain
of
reason
by
adding
to
it
the
practical
philosopher
draws
upon
it
and
makes
it
serve
him
according
to
kant
the
truth
of
experience
is
only
a
hypothetical
truth
if
the
suppositions
which
underlie
all
the
intimations
of
experience
subject
object
time
space
and
causality
were
removed
none
of
those
intimations
would
contain
a
word
of
truth
in
other
words
experience
is
only
a
phenomenon
it
is
not
knowledge
of
the
if
we
find
something
in
our
own
conduct
at
which
we
are
secretly
pleased
although
we
can
not
reconcile
it
with
experience
seeing
that
if
we
were
to
follow
the
guidance
of
experience
we
should
have
to
do
precisely
the
opposite
we
must
not
allow
this
to
put
us
out
otherwise
we
should
be
ascribing
an
authority
to
experience
which
it
does
not
deserve
for
all
that
it
teaches
rests
upon
a
mere
supposition
this
is
the
general
tendency
of
the
kantian
ethics
innocence
is
in
its
very
nature
stupid
it
is
stupid
because
the
aim
of
life
i
use
the
expression
only
figuratively
and
i
could
just
as
well
speak
of
the
essence
of
life
or
of
the
world
is
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
our
own
bad
will
so
that
our
will
may
become
an
object
for
us
and
that
we
may
undergo
an
inward
conversion
our
body
is
itself
our
will
objectified
it
is
one
of
the
first
and
foremost
of
objects
and
the
deeds
that
we
accomplish
for
the
sake
of
the
body
show
us
the
evil
inherent
in
our
will
in
the
state
of
innocence
where
there
is
no
evil
because
there
is
no
experience
man
is
as
it
were
only
an
apparatus
for
living
and
the
object
for
which
the
apparatus
exists
is
not
yet
disclosed
an
empty
form
of
life
like
this
a
stage
untenanted
is
in
itself
like
the
real
world
null
and
void
and
as
it
can
attain
a
meaning
only
by
action
by
error
by
knowledge
by
the
convulsions
of
the
will
it
wears
a
character
of
insipid
stupidity
a
golden
age
of
innocence
a
paradise
is
a
notion
that
is
stupid
and
unmeaning
and
for
that
very
reason
in
no
way
worthy
of
any
respect
the
first
criminal
and
murderer
cain
who
acquired
a
knowledge
of
guilt
and
through
guilt
acquired
a
knowledge
of
virtue
by
repentance
and
so
came
to
understand
the
meaning
of
life
is
a
tragical
figure
more
significant
and
almost
more
respectable
than
all
the
innocent
fools
in
the
world
put
together
if
i
had
to
write
about
i
should
say
i
know
the
esteemed
public
for
which
i
have
the
honour
to
write
far
too
well
to
dare
to
give
utterance
to
my
opinion
about
this
virtue
personally
i
am
quite
content
to
be
modest
and
to
apply
myself
to
this
virtue
with
the
utmost
possible
circumspection
but
one
thing
i
shall
never
admit
that
i
have
ever
required
modesty
of
any
man
and
any
statement
to
that
effect
i
repel
as
a
slander
the
paltry
character
of
most
men
compels
the
few
who
have
any
merit
or
genius
to
behave
as
though
they
did
not
know
their
own
value
and
consequently
did
not
know
other
people
want
of
value
for
it
is
only
on
this
condition
that
the
mob
acquiesces
in
tolerating
merit
a
virtue
has
been
made
out
of
this
necessity
and
it
is
called
modesty
it
is
a
piece
of
hypocrisy
to
be
excused
only
because
other
people
are
so
paltry
that
they
must
be
treated
with
indulgence
human
misery
may
affect
us
in
two
ways
and
we
may
be
in
one
of
two
opposite
moods
in
regard
to
it
in
one
of
them
this
misery
is
immediately
present
to
us
we
feel
it
in
our
own
person
in
our
own
will
which
imbued
with
violent
desires
is
everywhere
broken
and
this
is
the
process
which
constitutes
suffering
the
result
is
that
the
will
increases
in
violence
as
is
shown
in
all
cases
of
passion
and
emotion
and
this
increasing
violence
comes
to
a
stop
only
when
the
will
turns
and
gives
way
to
complete
resignation
in
other
words
is
redeemed
the
man
who
is
entirely
dominated
by
this
mood
will
regard
any
prosperity
which
he
may
see
in
others
with
envy
and
any
suffering
with
no
sympathy
in
the
opposite
mood
human
misery
is
present
to
us
only
as
a
fact
of
knowledge
that
is
to
say
indirectly
we
are
mainly
engaged
in
looking
at
the
sufferings
of
others
and
our
attention
is
withdrawn
from
our
own
it
is
in
their
person
that
we
become
aware
of
human
misery
we
are
filled
with
sympathy
and
the
result
of
this
mood
is
general
benevolence
philanthropy
all
envy
vanishes
and
instead
of
feeling
it
we
are
rejoiced
when
we
see
one
of
our
tormented
experience
any
pleasure
or
relief
after
the
same
fashion
we
may
be
in
one
of
two
opposite
moods
in
regard
to
human
baseness
and
depravity
in
the
one
we
perceive
this
baseness
indirectly
in
others
out
of
this
mood
arise
indignation
hatred
and
contempt
of
mankind
in
the
other
we
perceive
it
directly
in
ourselves
out
of
it
there
arises
humiliation
nay
contrition
in
order
to
judge
the
moral
value
of
a
man
it
is
very
important
to
observe
which
of
these
four
moods
predominate
in
him
they
go
in
pairs
one
out
of
each
division
in
very
excellent
characters
the
second
mood
of
each
division
will
predominate
the
categorical
imperative
or
absolute
command
is
a
contradiction
every
command
is
conditional
what
is
unconditional
and
necessary
is
a
such
as
is
presented
by
the
laws
of
nature
it
is
quite
true
that
the
moral
law
is
entirely
conditional
there
is
a
world
and
a
view
of
life
in
which
it
has
neither
validity
nor
significance
that
world
is
properly
speaking
the
real
world
in
which
as
individuals
we
live
for
every
regard
paid
to
morality
is
a
denial
of
that
world
and
of
our
individual
life
in
it
it
is
a
view
of
the
world
however
which
does
not
go
beyond
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
and
the
opposite
view
proceeds
by
the
intuition
of
ideas
if
a
man
is
under
the
influence
of
two
opposite
but
very
strong
motives
a
and
b
and
i
am
greatly
concerned
that
he
should
choose
a
but
still
more
that
he
should
never
be
untrue
to
his
choice
and
by
changing
his
mind
betray
me
or
the
like
it
will
not
do
for
me
to
say
anything
that
might
hinder
the
motive
b
from
having
its
full
effect
upon
him
and
only
emphasise
a
for
then
i
should
never
be
able
to
reckon
on
his
decision
what
i
have
to
do
is
rather
to
put
both
motives
before
him
at
the
same
time
in
as
vivid
and
clear
a
way
as
possible
so
that
they
may
work
upon
him
with
their
whole
force
the
choice
that
he
then
makes
is
the
decision
of
his
inmost
nature
and
stands
firm
to
all
eternity
in
saying
will
do
he
has
said
must
do
i
have
got
at
his
will
and
i
can
rely
upon
its
working
as
steadily
as
one
of
the
forces
of
nature
it
is
as
certain
as
fire
kindles
and
water
wets
that
he
will
act
according
to
the
motive
which
has
proved
to
be
stronger
for
him
insight
and
knowledge
may
be
attained
and
lost
again
they
may
be
changed
or
improved
or
destroyed
but
will
can
not
be
changed
that
is
why
apprehend
i
perceive
i
is
subject
to
alteration
and
uncertainty
pronounced
on
a
right
apprehension
of
motive
is
as
firm
as
nature
itself
the
difficulty
however
lies
in
getting
at
a
right
apprehension
a
man
apprehension
of
motive
may
change
or
be
corrected
or
perverted
and
on
the
other
hand
his
circumstances
may
undergo
an
alteration
a
man
should
exercise
an
almost
boundless
toleration
and
placability
because
if
he
is
capricious
enough
to
refuse
to
forgive
a
single
individual
for
the
meanness
or
evil
that
lies
at
his
door
it
is
doing
the
rest
of
the
world
a
quite
unmerited
honour
but
at
the
same
time
the
man
who
is
every
one
friend
is
no
friend
it
is
quite
obvious
what
sort
of
friendship
it
is
which
we
hold
out
to
the
human
race
and
to
which
it
is
open
to
almost
every
man
to
return
no
matter
what
he
may
have
done
with
the
ancients
was
one
of
the
chief
elements
in
morality
but
friendship
is
only
limitation
and
partiality
it
is
the
restriction
to
one
individual
of
what
is
the
due
of
all
mankind
namely
the
recognition
that
a
man
own
nature
and
that
of
mankind
are
identical
at
most
it
is
a
compromise
between
this
recognition
and
selfishness
a
lie
always
has
its
origin
in
the
desire
to
extend
the
dominion
of
one
own
will
over
other
individuals
and
to
deny
their
will
in
order
the
better
to
affirm
one
own
consequently
a
lie
is
in
its
very
nature
the
product
of
injustice
malevolence
and
villainy
that
is
why
truth
sincerity
candour
and
rectitude
are
at
once
recognised
and
valued
as
praiseworthy
and
noble
qualities
because
we
presume
that
the
man
who
exhibits
them
entertains
no
sentiments
of
injustice
or
malice
and
therefore
stands
in
no
need
of
concealing
such
sentiments
he
who
is
open
cherishes
nothing
that
is
bad
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
courage
which
springs
from
the
same
source
as
what
i
mean
is
that
the
man
is
almost
as
clearly
conscious
that
he
exists
in
other
individuals
as
in
himself
i
have
often
shown
how
this
feeling
gives
rise
to
it
also
gives
rise
to
courage
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
man
who
possesses
this
feeling
cares
less
for
his
own
individual
existence
as
he
lives
almost
as
much
in
the
general
existence
of
all
creatures
accordingly
he
is
little
concerned
for
his
own
life
and
its
belongings
this
is
by
no
means
the
sole
source
of
courage
for
it
is
a
phenomenon
due
to
various
causes
but
it
is
the
noblest
kind
of
courage
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
its
origin
it
is
associated
with
great
gentleness
and
patience
men
of
this
kind
are
usually
irresistible
to
women
all
general
rules
and
precepts
fail
because
they
proceed
from
the
false
assumption
that
men
are
constituted
wholly
or
almost
wholly
alike
an
assumption
which
the
philosophy
of
helvetius
expressly
makes
whereas
the
truth
is
that
the
original
difference
between
individuals
in
intellect
and
morality
is
immeasurable
the
question
as
to
whether
morality
is
something
real
is
the
question
whether
a
to
egoism
actually
exists
as
egoism
restricts
concern
for
welfare
to
a
single
individual
the
man
own
self
the
would
have
to
extend
it
to
all
other
individuals
it
is
only
because
the
will
is
above
and
beyond
time
that
the
stings
of
conscience
are
ineradicable
and
do
not
like
other
pains
gradually
wear
away
no
an
evil
deed
weighs
on
the
conscience
years
afterwards
as
heavily
as
if
it
had
been
freshly
committed
character
is
innate
and
conduct
is
merely
its
manifestation
the
occasion
for
great
misdeeds
comes
seldom
strong
keep
us
back
our
disposition
is
revealed
to
ourselves
by
our
desires
thoughts
emotions
when
it
remains
unknown
to
others
reflecting
on
all
this
we
might
suppose
it
possible
for
a
man
to
possess
in
some
sort
an
innate
evil
conscience
without
ever
having
done
anything
very
bad
do
to
others
what
you
would
like
done
to
this
is
perhaps
one
of
those
arguments
that
prove
or
rather
ask
too
much
for
a
prisoner
might
address
it
to
a
judge
stupid
people
are
generally
malicious
for
the
very
same
reason
as
the
ugly
and
the
deformed
similarly
genius
and
sanctity
are
akin
however
a
saint
may
be
he
will
nevertheless
have
a
dash
of
genius
in
him
and
however
many
errors
of
temperament
or
of
actual
character
a
genius
may
possess
he
will
still
exhibit
a
certain
nobility
of
disposition
by
which
he
shows
his
kinship
with
the
saint
the
great
difference
between
law
without
and
law
within
between
the
state
and
the
kingdom
of
god
is
very
clear
it
is
the
business
to
see
that
one
should
have
justice
done
to
it
regards
men
as
passive
beings
and
therefore
takes
no
account
of
anything
but
their
actions
the
moral
law
on
the
other
hand
is
concerned
that
one
should
do
it
regards
men
as
active
and
looks
to
the
will
rather
than
the
deed
to
prove
that
this
is
the
true
distinction
let
the
reader
consider
what
would
happen
if
he
were
to
say
conversely
that
it
is
the
state
business
that
every
one
should
do
justice
and
the
business
of
the
moral
law
that
every
one
should
have
justice
done
to
him
the
absurdity
is
obvious
as
an
example
of
the
distinction
let
me
take
the
case
of
a
debtor
and
a
creditor
disputing
about
a
debt
which
the
former
denies
a
lawyer
and
a
moralist
are
present
and
show
a
lively
interest
in
the
matter
both
desire
that
the
dispute
should
end
in
the
same
way
although
what
they
want
is
by
no
means
the
same
the
lawyer
says
want
this
man
to
get
back
what
belongs
to
and
the
moralist
want
that
man
to
do
his
it
is
with
the
will
alone
that
morality
is
concerned
whether
external
force
hinders
or
fails
to
hinder
the
will
from
working
does
not
in
the
least
matter
for
morality
the
external
world
is
real
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
able
or
unable
to
lead
and
influence
the
will
as
soon
as
the
will
is
determined
that
is
as
soon
as
a
resolve
is
taken
the
external
world
and
its
events
are
of
no
further
moment
and
practical
do
not
exist
for
if
the
events
of
the
world
had
any
such
reality
that
is
to
say
if
they
possessed
a
significance
in
themselves
or
any
other
than
that
derived
from
the
will
which
is
affected
by
them
what
a
grievance
it
would
be
that
all
these
events
lie
in
the
realm
of
chance
and
error
it
is
however
just
this
which
proves
that
the
important
thing
is
not
what
happens
but
what
is
willed
accordingly
let
the
incidents
of
life
be
left
to
the
play
of
chance
and
error
to
demonstrate
to
man
that
he
is
as
chaff
before
the
wind
the
state
concerns
itself
only
with
the
incidents
with
what
happens
nothing
else
has
any
reality
for
it
i
may
dwell
upon
thoughts
of
murder
and
poison
as
much
as
i
please
the
state
does
not
forbid
me
so
long
as
the
axe
and
rope
control
my
will
and
prevent
it
from
becoming
action
ethics
asks
what
are
the
duties
towards
others
which
justice
imposes
upon
us
in
other
words
what
must
i
render
the
law
of
nature
asks
what
need
i
not
submit
to
from
others
that
is
what
must
i
suffer
the
question
is
put
not
that
i
may
do
no
injustice
but
that
i
may
not
do
more
than
every
man
must
do
if
he
is
to
safeguard
his
existence
and
than
every
man
will
approve
being
done
in
order
that
he
may
be
treated
in
the
same
way
himself
and
further
that
i
may
not
do
more
than
society
will
permit
me
to
do
the
same
answer
will
serve
for
both
questions
just
as
the
same
straight
line
can
be
drawn
from
either
of
two
opposite
directions
namely
by
opposing
forces
or
again
as
the
angle
can
give
the
sine
or
the
sine
the
angle
it
has
been
said
that
the
historian
is
an
inverted
prophet
in
the
same
way
it
may
be
said
that
a
teacher
of
law
is
an
inverted
moralist
a
teacher
of
the
duties
of
justice
or
that
politics
are
inverted
ethics
if
we
exclude
the
thought
that
ethics
also
teaches
the
duty
of
benevolence
magnanimity
love
and
so
on
the
state
is
the
gordian
knot
that
is
cut
instead
of
being
untied
it
is
egg
which
is
made
to
stand
by
being
broken
instead
of
balanced
as
though
the
business
in
question
were
to
make
it
stand
rather
than
to
balance
it
in
this
respect
the
state
is
like
the
man
who
thinks
that
he
can
produce
fine
weather
by
making
the
barometer
go
up
the
of
our
age
tell
us
that
it
is
the
object
of
the
state
to
promote
the
moral
aims
of
mankind
this
is
not
true
it
is
rather
the
contrary
which
is
true
the
aim
for
which
mankind
exists
the
expression
is
parabolic
is
not
that
a
man
should
act
in
such
and
such
a
manner
for
all
things
that
have
actually
been
done
are
in
themselves
matters
of
indifference
no
the
aim
is
that
the
will
of
which
every
man
is
a
complete
specimen
nay
is
the
very
will
itself
should
turn
whither
it
needs
to
turn
that
the
man
himself
the
union
of
thought
and
will
should
perceive
what
this
will
is
and
what
horrors
it
contains
that
he
should
show
the
reflection
of
himself
in
his
own
deeds
in
the
abomination
of
them
the
state
which
is
wholly
concerned
with
the
general
welfare
checks
the
manifestation
of
the
bad
will
but
in
no
wise
checks
the
will
itself
the
attempt
would
be
impossible
it
is
because
the
state
checks
the
manifestation
of
his
will
that
a
man
very
seldom
sees
the
whole
abomination
of
his
nature
in
the
mirror
of
his
deeds
or
does
the
reader
actually
suppose
there
are
no
people
in
the
world
as
bad
as
robespierre
napoleon
or
other
murderers
does
he
fail
to
see
that
there
are
many
who
would
act
like
them
if
only
they
could
many
a
criminal
dies
more
quietly
on
the
scaffold
than
many
a
in
the
arms
of
his
family
the
one
has
perceived
what
his
will
is
and
has
discarded
it
the
other
has
not
been
able
to
discard
it
because
he
has
never
been
able
to
perceive
what
it
is
the
aim
of
the
state
is
to
produce
a
fool
paradise
and
this
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
true
aim
of
life
namely
to
attain
a
knowledge
of
what
the
will
in
its
horrible
nature
really
is
napoleon
was
not
really
worse
than
many
not
to
say
most
men
he
was
possessed
of
the
very
ordinary
egoism
that
seeks
its
welfare
at
the
expense
of
others
what
distinguished
him
was
merely
the
greater
power
he
had
of
satisfying
his
will
and
greater
intelligence
reason
and
courage
added
to
which
chance
gave
him
a
favourable
scope
for
his
operations
by
means
of
all
this
he
did
for
his
egoism
what
a
thousand
other
men
would
like
to
do
for
theirs
but
can
not
every
feeble
lad
who
by
little
acts
of
villainy
gains
a
small
advantage
for
himself
by
putting
others
to
some
disadvantage
although
it
may
be
equally
small
is
just
as
bad
as
napoleon
those
who
fancy
that
retribution
comes
after
death
would
demand
that
napoleon
should
by
unutterable
torments
pay
the
penalty
for
all
the
numberless
calamities
that
he
caused
but
he
is
no
more
culpable
than
all
those
who
possess
the
same
will
unaccompanied
by
the
same
power
the
circumstance
that
in
his
case
this
extraordinary
power
was
added
allowed
him
to
reveal
the
whole
wickedness
of
the
human
will
and
the
sufferings
of
his
age
as
the
necessary
obverse
of
the
medal
reveal
the
misery
which
is
inextricably
bound
up
with
this
bad
will
it
is
the
general
manipulation
of
this
will
that
constitutes
the
world
but
it
is
precisely
that
it
should
be
understood
how
inextricably
the
will
to
live
is
bound
up
with
and
is
really
one
and
the
same
as
this
unspeakable
misery
that
is
the
world
aim
and
purpose
and
it
is
an
aim
and
purpose
which
the
appearance
of
napoleon
did
much
to
assist
not
to
be
an
unmeaning
fools
paradise
but
a
tragedy
in
which
the
will
to
live
understands
itself
and
yields
that
is
the
object
for
which
the
world
exists
napoleon
is
only
an
enormous
mirror
of
the
will
to
live
the
difference
between
the
man
who
causes
suffering
and
the
man
who
suffers
it
is
only
phenomenal
it
is
all
a
will
to
live
identical
with
great
suffering
and
it
is
only
by
understanding
this
that
the
will
can
mend
and
end
what
chiefly
distinguishes
ancient
from
modern
times
is
that
in
ancient
times
to
use
napoleon
expression
it
was
affairs
that
reigned
paroles
aux
in
modern
times
this
is
not
so
what
i
mean
is
that
in
ancient
times
the
character
of
public
life
of
the
state
and
of
religion
as
well
as
of
private
life
was
a
strenuous
affirmation
of
the
will
to
live
in
modern
times
it
is
a
denial
of
this
will
for
such
is
the
character
of
christianity
but
now
while
on
the
one
hand
that
denial
has
suffered
some
abatement
even
in
public
opinion
because
it
is
too
repugnant
to
human
character
on
the
other
what
is
publicly
denied
is
secretly
affirmed
hence
it
is
that
we
see
half
measures
and
falsehood
everywhere
and
that
is
why
modern
times
look
so
small
beside
antiquity
the
structure
of
human
society
is
like
a
pendulum
swinging
between
two
impulses
two
evils
in
polar
opposition
and
the
further
it
gets
from
the
one
the
nearer
it
approaches
the
other
from
this
the
reader
might
hit
on
the
thought
that
if
it
were
exactly
midway
between
the
two
it
would
be
right
far
from
it
for
these
two
evils
are
by
no
means
equally
bad
and
dangerous
the
former
is
incomparably
less
to
be
feared
its
ills
exist
in
the
main
only
as
possibilities
and
if
they
come
at
all
it
is
only
one
among
millions
that
they
touch
but
with
anarchy
possibility
and
actuality
are
inseparable
its
blows
fall
on
every
man
every
day
therefore
every
constitution
should
be
a
nearer
approach
to
a
despotism
than
to
anarchy
nay
it
must
contain
a
small
possibility
of
despotism
