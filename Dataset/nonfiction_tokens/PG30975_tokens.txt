prefatory
note
to
the
reader
if
he
who
causes
two
blades
of
grass
to
grow
where
but
one
grew
before
is
a
benefactor
of
his
race
he
is
not
less
so
who
imparts
to
millions
a
knowledge
of
the
methods
by
which
it
is
done
the
last
half
century
has
been
the
era
of
experiments
and
writing
on
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
the
result
has
been
the
acquisition
of
more
knowledge
on
the
subjects
embraced
than
the
world
had
attained
in
all
its
previous
history
that
knowledge
is
scattered
through
many
volumes
of
numerous
periodicals
and
books
and
interspersed
with
many
theories
and
much
speculation
that
can
never
be
valuable
in
practice
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
presented
it
confuses
rather
than
aids
the
great
mass
of
cultivators
hence
the
prejudice
against
provided
established
facts
only
are
presented
they
are
none
the
worse
for
being
printed
the
object
of
this
volume
is
to
condense
and
present
in
an
intelligible
form
all
important
established
facts
in
the
science
of
the
author
claims
originality
as
to
the
discovery
of
facts
and
principles
in
but
few
cases
during
ten
years
of
preparatory
study
for
this
work
he
has
sought
the
rewards
of
industry
in
sifting
out
the
certain
and
the
useful
from
the
hypothetical
and
the
fanciful
and
the
results
of
judicious
discrimination
between
fallacy
and
just
reasoning
in
support
of
theories
this
volume
is
designed
to
be
a
complete
manual
for
all
but
amateur
cultivators
while
it
is
believed
that
he
who
follows
its
directions
will
be
certain
of
success
it
is
not
intended
to
disparage
the
merits
of
other
works
but
to
encourage
and
extend
their
perusal
we
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
to
young
culturists
to
keep
themselves
well
posted
in
this
kind
of
literature
and
give
to
every
discovery
and
invention
in
this
science
a
fair
trial
not
on
a
large
scale
so
as
to
sink
money
in
fruitless
experiments
but
sufficient
to
afford
a
sure
test
of
their
real
value
to
no
class
of
men
is
study
more
important
than
to
it
is
believed
that
the
directions
here
given
if
followed
will
save
millions
of
dollars
annually
to
that
class
of
cultivators
who
can
least
afford
to
waste
time
and
money
in
experimenting
with
beginners
it
is
important
to
be
successful
at
first
which
is
impossible
without
availing
themselves
of
the
experience
of
others
while
we
thus
aim
to
give
our
volume
this
exclusively
practical
form
and
utilitarian
character
we
do
not
undervalue
the
labors
of
amateur
cultivators
a
meed
of
praise
is
due
to
those
who
are
willing
to
spend
time
and
money
in
experiments
by
which
great
truths
are
evolved
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
perfection
is
not
claimed
for
this
volume
but
the
author
hopes
nothing
will
be
found
here
that
is
untrue
a
fear
of
inserting
errors
may
have
induced
us
to
omit
some
things
that
may
yet
prove
valuable
if
anything
seems
to
be
at
variance
with
a
cultivator
observation
in
a
given
locality
he
will
discover
in
our
general
principles
on
climate
soil
and
location
that
it
is
a
natural
result
as
far
as
we
has
been
our
motto
it
is
hoped
the
form
is
most
convenient
all
is
arranged
under
one
alphabet
with
a
complete
index
the
author
has
consulted
many
intelligent
cultivators
and
writers
who
without
exception
approve
his
plan
all
agree
in
saying
that
it
is
designed
to
fill
a
place
not
occupied
by
any
other
single
volume
in
the
language
it
is
impossible
without
cumbering
the
volume
to
give
suitable
credit
to
the
authors
and
persons
consulted
suffice
it
to
say
the
author
has
carefully
studied
all
the
works
mentioned
in
this
volume
and
availed
himself
of
a
great
variety
of
verbal
suggestions
by
scientific
and
practical
men
if
this
work
shall
in
any
good
degree
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
intended
it
will
amply
reward
the
author
for
an
amount
of
labor
experiment
observation
and
study
appreciable

this
is
the
art
of
successfully
changing
fruits
or
plants
from
one
climate
to
another
removal
to
a
colder
climate
should
be
effected
in
the
spring
and
to
a
warmer
one
in
the
fall
this
may
be
done
by
scions
or
seeds
by
seeds
is
better
in
all
cases
in
which
they
will
produce
the
same
varieties
very
few
imported
apple
or
pear
trees
are
valuable
in
this
country
while
our
finest
varieties
perfectly
adapted
to
our
climate
were
raised
from
seeds
of
foreign
fruits
and
their
descendants
the
same
is
true
of
the
extremes
of
this
country
baldwin
forty
or
fifty
years
old
are
perfectly
hardy
in
the
colder
parts
of
new
england
while
the
same
imported
from
warmer
sections
of
the
union
fail
in
severe
winters
this
fact
has
given
many
new
localities
the
reputation
of
being
poor
when
we
remove
to
a
similar
climate
in
a
new
country
they
flourish
well
and
we
call
it
a
good
remove
trees
from
the
same
nursery
to
a
different
climate
and
soil
and
they
are
not
hardy
and
vigorous
and
we
call
it
a
poor
these
two
localities
may
be
equally
good
for
fruit
with
suitable
care
in
acclimating
the
tree
and
preparing
the
soil
thus
the
rich
prairies
of
central
illinois
are
often
said
not
to
be
adapted
to
fruit
give
time
to
raise
fruits
from
the
seed
and
to
apply
the
principles
of
acclimation
and
those
rich
prairies
will
be
among
the
great
regions
of
the
world
two
things
are
essential
to
successful
on
all
the
alluvial
soils
of
the
northwest
raise
from
seed
and
prune
closely
and
short
and
thus
put
back
and
strengthen
the
trees
for
the
first
ten
years
and
no
more
complaints
will
be
heard
the
peach
has
been
gradually
acclimated
until
transplanted
from
perpetual
summer
it
successfully
endures
a
temperature
of
degrees
below
zero
this
prince
of
fruits
will
yet
be
successfully
grown
even
beyond
the
northern
limits
of
minnesota
many
vegetables
may
also
be
grown
in
very
different
climates
by
annually
importing
the
seed
from
localities
where
they
naturally
flourish
sweet
potatoes
are
thus
grown
abundantly
in
massachusetts
we
wonder
this
subject
has
received
so
little
attention
we
commend
these
brief
hints
to
the
earnest
consideration
of
all
practical
cultivators
hoping
they
may
be
of
great
value
in
the
results
to
which
they
may
lead
almonds
almonds
are
natives
of
several
parts
of
asia
and
africa
they
perfectly
resemble
the
peach
in
all
but
the
fruit
the
peach
and
almond
grow
well
budded
into
each
other
in
france
are
preferred
for
the
peach
their
cultivation
and
propagation
are
in
all
respects
the
same
as
the
peach
long
hard
shell
this
is
the
best
for
cultivation
in
western
and
middle
states
and
in
all
cold
regions
very
ornamental
common
sweet
productive
in
middle
states
but
not
so
good
as
the
first
ladies
thin
shell
fruit
large
long
and
sweet
the
very
best
variety
but
not
so
hardy
as
the
first
two
grows
well
in
warm
locations
with
slight
protection
in
winter
the
bitter
large
with
very
ornamental
leaves
and
blossoms
fruit
bitter
and
yielding
that
deadly
poison
prussic
acid
peach
almond
so
called
from
having
a
pulp
equal
to
a
poor
peach
not
hardy
in
northern
climates
other
varieties
are
named
but
are
of
no
consequence
to
the
practical
cultivator
two
varieties
of
ornamental
almonds
are
very
beautiful
in
spring
the
large
double
flowering
and
the
dwarf
flowering
but
we
regard
quite
as
ornamental
and
the
ripe
peaches
much
more
so
and
so
prefer
to
cultivate
them
almonds
are
extensively
cultivated
in
the
south
of
europe
especially
in
portugal
as
an
article
of
commerce
they
will
grow
equally
well
in
this
country
but
labor
is
so
cheap
in
europe
that
american
cultivators
can
not
compete
with
it
in
the
almond
market
but
every
one
owning
land
should
cultivate
a
few
as
a
family
luxury
apples
the
original
of
all
our
apples
was
the
wild
european
crab
we
have
in
this
country
several
native
crabs
larger
and
better
than
the
european
but
they
have
not
yet
as
we
are
aware
been
developed
into
fine
apples
are
hardy
and
doing
well
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
trees
however
are
thought
to
last
only
about
fifty
years
an
imported
from
england
produced
fruit
in
connecticut
at
the
age
of
two
hundred
and
eight
years
the
apple
is
the
most
valuable
of
all
fruits
the
peach
the
best
pears
the
strawberries
and
others
are
all
delicious
in
their
day
but
apples
are
adapted
to
a
greater
variety
of
uses
and
are
in
perfection
all
the
year
the
earliest
may
be
used
in
june
and
the
latest
may
be
kept
until
that
time
next
year
as
an
article
of
food
they
are
very
valuable
on
account
of
both
their
nutritive
and
medicinal
qualities
as
a
gentle
laxative
they
are
invaluable
for
children
who
should
always
be
allowed
to
eat
ripe
apples
as
they
please
when
they
can
be
afforded
children
will
not
long
be
inclined
to
eat
ripe
fruit
to
their
injury
an
almost
exclusive
diet
of
baked
sweet
apples
and
milk
is
recorded
as
having
cured
chronic
cases
of
consumption
and
other
diseases
caused
by
too
rich
food
let
dyspeptics
vary
the
mode
of
preparing
and
using
an
apple
diet
until
it
agrees
with
them
and
many
aggravated
cases
may
be
cured
without
medicine
it
is
strange
how
the
idea
has
gained
so
much
currency
that
apples
although
a
pleasant
luxury
are
not
sufficiently
nutritious
for
a
valuable
article
of
diet
there
is
no
other
fruit
or
vegetable
in
general
use
that
contains
such
a
proportion
of
nutriment
it
has
been
ascertained
in
germany
by
a
long
course
of
experiments
that
men
will
perform
more
labor
endure
more
fatigue
and
be
more
healthy
on
an
apple
diet
than
on
that
universal
indispensable
for
the
poor
the
potato
apples
are
more
valuable
than
potatoes
for
food
they
are
equally
valuable
as
food
for
fowls
swine
sheep
cattle
and
horses
hogs
have
been
well
fattened
on
apples
alone
cooked
with
other
vegetables
and
mixed
with
a
little
ground
grain
or
bran
they
are
an
economical
food
for
fattening
pork
or
beef
sweet
or
apples
fed
to
neat
stock
or
horses
will
prevent
disease
and
keep
the
animals
in
fine
condition
for
human
food
they
may
be
cooked
in
a
greater
variety
of
ways
than
almost
any
other
article
is
valuable
for
some
uses
it
makes
the
best
vinegar
in
general
use
and
when
well
made
and
bottled
is
better
than
most
of
our
wines
for
invalids
or
boiled
cider
which
is
cider
boiled
down
until
it
will
not
ferment
is
excellent
in
cookery
is
highly
esteemed
in
many
families
dried
apples
are
an
important
article
of
commerce
green
apples
are
also
exported
to
most
parts
of
the
world
notwithstanding
the
increased
attention
to
their
cultivation
during
the
last
their
market
value
is
steadily
increasing
and
doubtless
will
be
for
the
best
varieties
for
the
next
five
hundred
years
it
does
not
cost
more
than
five
or
six
cents
per
bushel
to
raise
apples
hence
they
are
one
of
the
most
profitable
crops
a
farmer
can
raise
no
farm
therefore
is
complete
without
a
good
orchard
the
man
who
owns
but
five
acres
of
land
should
have
at
least
two
acres
in
apples
will
succeed
well
on
any
soil
that
will
produce
good
cabbages
potatoes
or
indian
corn
land
needs
as
much
manure
and
care
for
as
for
potatoes
rough
hillsides
and
broken
lands
unsuitable
for
general
cultivation
may
be
made
very
valuable
in
orchards
it
must
be
enriched
if
not
originally
so
and
kept
clean
about
the
trees
on
no
crop
does
good
culture
pay
better
many
suppose
that
an
being
a
great
grower
will
take
care
of
itself
after
having
attained
a
moderate
size
whoever
observes
the
great
and
rapid
growth
of
must
see
that
when
the
ground
is
nearly
covered
with
them
they
must
make
a
great
draft
on
the
soil
to
secure
health
and
increased
value
the
deficiency
must
be
supplied
in
manure
and
cultivation
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
fruit
depend
mainly
on
the
condition
of
the
land
the
kinds
and
proportions
of
manures
best
for
an
are
important
practical
questions
we
give
a
chemical
analysis
of
the
ashes

are
indispensable
on
an
old
orchard
they
will
improve
the
fruit
one
half
both
in
quantity
and
quality
this
is
done
mainly
by
seeds
budding
and
grafting
the
best
method
is
by
common
on
all
stocks
large
enough
and
by
whip
or
tongue
grafting
on
all
others
see
under
article
grafting
grafting
into
the
sycamore
is
recommended
by
some
the
scions
are
said
to
grow
profusely
and
to
bear
early
and
abundantly
but
they
are
apt
to
be
killed
by
cold
winters
we
do
not
recommend
it
almost
everything
does
best
budded
or
grafted
into
vigorous
stocks
of
its
own
nature
as
it
is
termed
that
is
cutting
up
roots
into
pieces
three
or
four
inches
long
and
putting
a
scion
into
each
has
been
a
matter
of
much
discussion
and
diversity
of
opinion
it
is
certainly
a
means
of
most
rapidly
multiplying
a
given
variety
and
is
therefore
profitable
to
the
nurseryman
for
ourselves
we
should
prefer
trees
grafted
just
above
or
at
the
ground
using
the
whole
stock
for
one
tree
we
do
not
however
undertake
to
settle
this
controverted
point
our
minds
are
fixed
against
it
others
must
do
as
they
please
propagation
by
seed
is
thought
to
be
entirely
uncertain
because
as
is
supposed
the
seeds
will
not
reproduce
their
own
varieties
we
consider
this
far
from
being
an
established
fact
when
grafts
are
put
into
large
trees
high
up
from
the
ground
their
fruit
may
be
somewhat
modified
by
the
stock
there
is
also
a
slight
tendency
in
the
seeds
of
all
grafts
to
return
to
the
varieties
from
which
they
descended
but
we
believe
the
general
rule
to
be
that
the
seeds
of
grafts
put
in
at
the
ground
and
standing
alone
will
generally
produce
the
same
varieties
of
fruit
the
most
prominent
obstacle
in
the
way
of
this
reproduction
is
the
presence
of
other
varieties
which
mix
in
the
blossom
the
planting
of
seeds
from
any
mixed
orchard
can
never
settle
this
question
because
they
are
never
pure
propagation
by
seeds
then
is
an
inconvenient
method
only
to
be
resorted
to
for
purposes
of
acclimation
but
it
is
so
seldom
we
have
a
good
bearing
so
far
removed
from
others
as
not
to
be
affected
by
the
blossoms
that
we
generally
get
from
seeds
a
modification
of
varieties
raising
suitable
stocks
for
grafting
is
done
by
planting
seeds
in
drills
thirty
inches
apart
and
keeping
clear
of
weeds
until
they
are
large
enough
to
graft
the
soil
should
be
made
very
rich
to
save
time
in
their
growth
land
where
grew
the
previous
year
is
the
best
if
kept
clear
of
weeds
on
rich
deep
soil
from
one
to
two
thirds
of
them
will
be
large
enough
for
after
the
first
year
growth
the
pomice
from
the
is
often
planted
it
is
better
to
separate
the
seeds
and
plant
them
with
a
they
will
then
be
in
straight
narrow
rows
allowing
the
cultivator
and
hoe
to
pass
close
by
them
and
thus
save
two
thirds
of
the
cost
of
cultivation
the
question
of
keeping
seeds
dry
or
moist
until
planting
is
one
of
some
importance
most
seeds
are
better
for
being
kept
slightly
moist
until
planted
but
with
the
apple
it
makes
no
difference
keep
dry
and
spread
as
they
are
apt
to
heat
freezing
them
is
not
of
the
slightest
importance
if
you
plant
pomice
put
in
a
little
lime
or
ashes
to
counteract
the
acid
for
pull
the
seedlings
that
are
of
suitable
size
cut
off
the
tops
eight
inches
from
the
root
and
pack
in
moist
sand
in
a
cellar
that
will
not
freeze
after
grafting
tie
them
up
in
bunches
and
pack
in
tight
boxes
of
moist
sand
or
sawdust
this
is
fully
treated
elsewhere
in
this
work
we
give
under
each
fruit
only
what
is
peculiar
to
that
species
in
mild
climates
transplant
in
the
fall
and
in
cold
in
the
spring
must
never
be
done
until
the
soil
has
become
dry
enough
to
be
made
fine
a
soil
is
the
great
essential
of
successful
transplanting
trees
for
should
always
be
taken
up
before
the
commencement
of
vegetation
but
in
very
wet
springs
this
occurs
before
the
ground
becomes
sufficiently
dry
it
is
then
best
to
take
up
the
trees
and
heel
them
in
and
keep
them
until
the
soil
is
suitable
the
place
for
an
should
be
made
larger
than
for
any
other
tree
because
its
roots
are
like
its
branches
the
earth
should
be
thrown
out
to
the
depth
of
twenty
inches
and
four
or
five
feet
square
for
an
tree
this
however
will
not
do
on
a
heavy
clay
subsoil
for
it
would
form
a
basin
to
hold
water
and
injure
the
tree
a
ditch
as
low
as
the
bottom
of
the
holes
should
extend
from
tree
to
tree
and
running
out
of
the
orchard
constructed
in
the
usual
method
of
drains
and
whatever
be
the
subsoil
the
trees
will
flourish
the
usual
compost
to
manure
the
trees
in
transplanting
will
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
bottom
of
these
places
for
should
be
thrown
a
plenty
of
cobblestones
with
a
few
sods
and
a
little
decaying
wood
and
coarse
manure
we
know
of
nothing
so
good
under
an
as
small
stones
the
tree
will
always
be
the
larger
and
thriftier
for
it
this
is
in
a
degree
beneficial
to
other
fruits
but
peculiarly
so
to
the
apple
for
small
trees
usually
do
best
large
trees
are
often
transplanted
with
the
hope
of
having
an
abundance
of
fruit
earlier
this
usually
defeats
the
object
the
large
trees
will
bear
a
little
fruit
earlier
than
the
small
ones
but
the
injury
by
removal
is
so
much
greater
that
the
small
stocky
trees
come
into
full
regular
bearing
much
the
soonest
from
five
to
eight
feet
high
is
often
most
convenient
for
culture
but
wherever
we
can
take
care
of
them
it
is
better
to
set
out
smaller
trees
they
will
do
better
for
years
a
suitable
drain
extending
through
the
orchard
under
each
row
of
trees
will
make
a
good
orchard
on
low
wet
land
at
the
time
of
injured
roots
should
be
removed
as
in
the
general
directions
under
transplanting
but
the
idea
of
cutting
off
most
of
the
top
is
a
very
serious
error
when
large
trees
are
transplanted
which
must
necessarily
lose
many
of
their
roots
in
removal
a
corresponding
portion
of
the
top
must
be
separated
but
in
no
other
case
the
leaves
are
the
lungs
of
the
tree
how
shall
it
have
vitality
if
most
of
them
are
removed
it
is
like
destroying
one
lung
and
half
of
the
other
and
then
expect
a
man
to
be
in
vigorous
health
we
have
often
seen
the
most
of
two
years
growth
of
trees
lost
by
such
reckless
pruning
if
the
roots
are
tolerably
whole
and
sound
leave
the
top
so
a
needs
to
be
trimmed
much
closer
when
transplanted
because
it
has
so
many
more
buds
to
throw
out
leaves
this
is
quite
as
beneficial
to
as
to
all
transplanted
trees
well
done
it
preserves
a
regularity
of
moisture
that
almost
insures
the
life
of
the
tree
the
tops
should
be
kept
open
and
exposed
to
the
sun
the
cross
limbs
cut
out
and
everything
removed
that
shows
decided
symptoms
of
decay
the
productiveness
of
depends
very
much
upon
pruning
very
sparingly
and
judiciously
there
are
two
ways
to
keep
an
open
top
one
is
to
allow
many
large
limbs
to
grow
and
cut
out
most
of
the
small
ones
thus
leaving
a
large
collection
of
bare
poles
without
anything
on
which
the
fruit
can
grow
the
other
method
is
to
allow
few
limbs
to
grow
large
and
keep
them
well
covered
with
small
twigs
which
always
bear
the
fruit
the
latter
method
will
produce
two
or
three
times
as
much
fruit
as
the
former
the
head
of
an
should
be
formed
at
a
height
that
will
allow
a
team
to
pass
around
under
its
branches
in
a
orchard
that
is
designed
to
cover
the
ground
the
trees
should
be
two
rods
feet
apart
when
it
is
designed
always
to
cultivate
the
ground
and
land
is
plenty
set
them
fifty
or
sixty
feet
apart
you
will
be
likely
always
to
have
fine
fruit
and
a
crop
on
the
land
beside
our
recommendation
to
every
one
is
to
set
out
all
orchards
of
whatever
fruit
so
as
to
have
them
cover
the
whole
ground
when
in
maturity
among
dwarf
pears
peaches
or
quinces
may
be
set
which
will
be
profitable
before
the
apples
need
all
the
ground
a
cultivator
may
have
a
part
of
his
orchard
bear
one
year
and
the
remainder
the
next
or
he
may
have
them
all
bear
every
year
there
are
two
reasons
why
a
tree
bears
full
this
year
and
will
not
bear
the
next
one
is
it
is
allowed
to
have
such
a
superabundance
of
fruit
to
mature
this
year
that
it
has
no
strength
to
mature
for
the
next
and
hence
a
barren
year
the
other
reason
is
a
want
of
proper
culture
and
the
specific
manures
for
the
apple
manure
highly
keep
off
the
insects
cultivate
well
and
do
not
allow
too
much
to
remain
on
the
trees
one
season
and
you
will
have
a
good
crop
every
year
but
if
one
would
let
his
trees
take
the
natural
course
but
wishes
to
change
the
bearing
year
of
half
of
his
orchard
he
can
accomplish
it
by
removing
the
blossoms
or
young
fruit
from
a
part
of
his
trees
on
the
bearing
year
and
those
trees
having
no
fruit
to
mature
will
put
forth
an
abundance
of
buds
for
fruit
the
following
season
thus
the
will
be
changed
without
lessening
the
productiveness
go
through
a
in
what
is
called
the
seasons
and
you
will
find
some
orchards
and
some
trees
very
full
of
fruit
trees
of
the
same
variety
in
another
orchard
near
by
will
have
very
little
fruit
this
shows
that
the
bearing
season
is
a
matter
of
mere
habit
in
all
except
what
is
determined
by
late
frosts
this
fact
may
be
turned
to
great
pecuniary
value
by
producing
an
abundance
of
apples
every
year
and
an
should
be
often
plowed
but
not
too
deep
among
the
roots
when
not
actually
under
the
plow
it
should
be
pastured
with
fowls
calves
or
sheep
swine
are
recommended
as
they
will
eat
all
the
apples
that
fall
prematurely
and
with
them
the
worms
that
made
them
fall
but
we
have
often
seen
hogs
by
their
rooting
and
rubbing
kill
the
trees
better
to
pick
up
the
apples
that
fall
too
early
and
give
them
to
the
swine
turkeys
and
hens
in
an
orchard
will
do
much
to
destroy
the
various
insects
they
may
be
removed
for
a
short
time
when
they
begin
to
peck
the
ripening
fruit
orchards
pastured
by
sheep
are
said
not
to
be
infested
with
caterpillars
sheep
pastured
and
salted
under

enrich
the
soil
and
in
those
elements
peculiarly
beneficial
there
are
several
of
these
that
are
quite
destructive
when
not
properly
guarded
against
two
things
are
necessary
and
united
and
thoroughly
performed
they
afford
a
remedy
or
a
preventive
for
most
of
the
depredations
of
all
insects
keep
the
trees
well
cleared
of
all
rough
loose
bark
which
affords
so
many
for
insects
wash
the
trunks
and
large
limbs
of
the
trees
twice
between
the
of
may
and
the
of
august

a
ley
of
or
dissolved
potash

bear
it
strong
enough
to
kill
some
of
the
finest
cherries

you
add

any

very
offensive
article
it
will
be
still
better
the
insect
that
produces
this
worm

its
egg
in
the
of
the
young
apple

egg
makes
a
worm

passes
down
about
the
core
and
ruins
the
fruit

so
affected

fall
prematurely

should
be
picked
up
and
fed
to

this
done
every
day
during
their
falling
which
does
not
last
a
great
while
will
remedy
the
evil
in
two
seasons
the
worm
that
crawls
from
the
fallen
apple
gets
into
crevices
in
rough
bark
and
spins
his
cocoon
in
which
he
remains

a

care
enough
to
attend
to
it
the
best
remedy
is
to
bind
a
handful
of
straw
around
the
tree
two
feet
from
the
ground
tied
on
with
one
band
and
the
ends
allowed
to
stand
out
from
the
tree
the
females
who
can
not
fly
but
only
ascend
the
trunk
by
crawling
will
get
up
under
the
straw
and
may
easily
be
killed
by
striking
a
covered
mallet
on
the
straw
and
against
the
tree
below
the
band
this
should
be
attended
to
every
day
during
the
short
season
of
their
ascent
and
all
will
be
destroyed
burn
the
straw
about
the
last
of
may
but
those
who
are
too
indolent
or
busy
to
do
this
often
till
their
season
is
past
may
melt
over
a
hot
fire
and
smear
bandages
of
cloth
or
leather
previously
put
tight
around
the
tree
this
will
prevent
the
female
moth
from
crossing
and
reaching
the
limbs
tar
is
used
but
is
better
as
weather
will
not
injure
it
as
it
will
tar
so
as
to
allow
the
moth
to
pass
over
put
this
on
early
and
well
and
let
it
remain
till
the
last
of
may
but
the
first
the
process
of
killing
them
is
far
the
best
all
fruit
designed
to
be
kept
even
for
a
few
weeks
should
be
picked
and
not
shaken
off
and
laid
not
dropped
into
a
basket
and
with
equal
care
put
into
the
barrels
in
which
it
is
to
be
kept
or
transported
the
barrel
should
be
slightly
shaken
and
filled
entirely
full
let
it
stand
open
two
days
to
allow
the
fruit
to
sweat
and
throw
off
the
excessive
moisture
then
head
up
tight
and
keep
in
a
cool
open
shed
until
freezing
weather
then
keep
where
they
can
occasionally
have
good
air
and
in
as
cool
a
place
as
possible
without
danger
of
freezing
of
all
the
methods
of
keeping
apples
on
shelves
buried
as
potatoes
in
various
other
articles
as
chaff
sawdust
this
is
on
the
whole
the
best
and
cheapest
wrapping
the
apples
in
paper
before
putting
them
into
the
barrels
may
be
an
improvement
apples
gathered
just
before
hard
frosts
or
as
they
are
beginning
to
ripen
but
before
many
have
fallen
from
the
trees
and
packed
as
above
and
the
barrels
laid
on
their
sides
in
a
good
dry
dark
cellar
where
air
can
occasionally
be
admitted
can
be
kept
in
perfection
from
six
to
eight
weeks
after
the
ordinary
time
for
their
decay
apples
for
cider
or
other
immediate
use
may
be
shaken
off
upon
mats
or
blankets
spread
under
the
tree
for
that
purpose
they
are
not
quite
so
valuable
but
it
saves
times
in
gathering
are
exceedingly
numerous
and
uncertain
cole
estimates
that
two
millions
of
varieties
have
been
produced
in
the
single
state
of
maine
and
that
thousands
of
kinds
may
there
be
found
superior
to
those
generally
recommended
in
the
the
minute
description
of
fruits
is
not
of
the
least
use
to
one
out
of
ten
thousand
cultivators
the
best
pomologists
differ
in
the
names
and
descriptions
of
the
various
fruits
some
varieties
have
as
many
as
synonyms
of
what
use
then
is
the
minute
description
of
the
hundred
and
varieties
of
cole
american
or
of
the
vast
numbers
described
by
downing
elliott
barry
and
hooper
the
best
pear
we
saw
in
illinois
could
not
be
identified
in
elliott
by
a
practical
we
had
in
our
orchard
in
ohio
a
single
producing
a
large
yield
of
one
of
the
very
best
apples
we
ever
saw
it
was
called
natural
beauty
we
could
not
learn
from
the
what
it
was
we
took
it
to
an
amateur
cultivator
of
thirty
years
experience
and
he
could
not
identify
it
this
is
a
fair
view
of
the
condition
of
the
nomenclature
of
fruits
the
london
experimental
gardens
are
doing
much
to
systemize
it
and
the
most
scientific
growers
are
congratulating
them
on
their
success
but
it
never
can
be
any
better
than
it
is
now
varieties
will
increase
more
and
more
rapidly
and
synonyms
will
be
multiplied
annually
and
the
modification
of
varieties
by
stocks
manures
climates
and
location
will
render
it
more
and
more
confused
we
can
depend
only
upon
our
nurserymen
to
collect
all
improved
varieties
and
where
we
do
not
see
the
for
ourselves
trust
the
nurseryman
description
of
the
general
qualities
of
fruit
seldom
indeed
will
a
cultivator
buy
and
set
out
his
orchard
and
master
the
descriptions
in
the
and
after
his
trees
come
into
bearing
minutely
try
them
by
all
the
marks
to
see
whether
he
has
been
cheated
and
if
so
take
up
the
trees
and
put
out
others
to
go
the
same
round
again
perhaps
with
no
better
success
hence
if
possible
let
planters
get
trees
from
a
nursery
so
near
at
hand
that
they
may
know
the
quality
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
from
which
the
grafts
are
taken
get
the
most
popular
in
their
vicinity
and
always
secure
a
few
scions
from
any
extraordinary
apple
they
may
chance
to
taste
it
is
well
also
to
deal
only
with
the
most
honorable
nurserymen
remember
that
varieties
will
not
do
alike
well
in
all
localities
many
need
acclimation
every
extensive
cultivator
should
keep
seedlings
growing
with
a
view
to
new
varieties
or
modifications
of
old
ones
adapted
to
his
locality
we
did
think
of
describing
minutely
a
few
of
the
best
varieties
adapted
to
the
different
seasons
of
the
year
but
we
can
see
no
advantage
it
would
be
to
the
great
mass
of
cultivators
for
whom
this
book
is
designed
those
who
wish
to
acquaint
themselves
with
those
descriptions
will
purchase

the
best

with

we

carefully
examined
the
varieties
recommended
by

by
kirtland
and
elliott
by
barry
and
by
the
national
convention
of
and
find
a
general
agreement
on

main

there
are
some
differences
of
opinion
but
they
are
minor
they
have
left
out

and
added
some
as
a
matter
of

all
this
only
goes
to
show
the
established
character
of

main
varieties
out
of

these
select
a

of
those
named
in

of
the
lists

you
will
have
all
that
ever
need

six
might
be
still
better
yet
in

you
will
find

not
named

that

they
are
very
fine
rhode

fail
in

while
in

they

now
it
is
contrary
to
all
laws
of
vegetation
and
climate
that
a
given
fruit
should
be
good
in
one
county
and
useless
in
the
next
if
they
have
an
equal
chance
in
each
place

suitable

it

one

fail

parallel

a
man
may
happen
to
plant
a

it
does
well
another
chances
to
plant
one
upon
a
soil
of
a
different
character
and
it
does
not
succeed
it
is
then
proclaimed
that
fruit
succeeds
well
in
one
locality
and
is
useless
in
another
near
by
and
in
the
same
latitude
the
truth
is
had
the
latter
supplied
calcareous
substances
to
his
deficient
soil
as
he
might
easily
have
done
in
bones
plaster
lime
the
fruit
would
have
done
equally
well
in
both
cases
we
should
like
to
see
this
subject
discussed
as
it
never
has
been
in
any
work
that
has
come
under
our

it
would
redeem
many
a

bad
reputation

apricot
this
is
a
fruit
about
between
a
peach
and
a
plum
the
stone
is
like
the
plum
and
the
flesh
rather
more
like
the
peach
it
is
esteemed
principally
because
it
comes
earlier
in
the
season
than
anything
else
of
the
kind
it
is
used
as
a
for
preserving
drying
and
various
purposes
in

it
does
well
on

grafts
on
plums
are
much
better
than
on
the
peach
the
latter
seldom
produce
good
hardy
thrifty
trees
although
many
persist
in
trying
them
the
apricot
is
a
favorite
tree
for
espalier
training
against
walls
and
fences
in
small
yards
where
it
bears
luxuriantly
it
also
makes
a
good
handsome
standard
tree
for
open
cultivation
it
is
as
much
exposed
to
depredations
from
curculio
as
the
plum
and
must
be
treated
in
the
same
way
cultivation
same
as
peach
it
produces
its
fruit
like
the
peach
only
on

it

and
fancy
they
are

to
be
in
the
blossoms
as
they
bloom
very
early
otherwise
they
are
always
very
productive
they
are
ornamental

every
garden
should
have
half
a
dozen
artichoke
there
are
two
plants
known
by
this
name
the
jerusalem
artichoke
so
called
not
from
jerusalem
in
palestine
but
a
corruption
of
the
italian
name
which
signifies
the
sunflower
the
tubers
are
only
used
for
pickling
they
make
a
very
indigestible
pickle
and
the
plant
is
injurious
to
the
garden
so
they
had
better
not
be
raised
the
artichoke
proper
grows
something
like
a
thistle
bearing
certain
heads
that
at
a
particular
stage
of
their
growth
are
fine
for
food
the
soil
should
be
prepared
as
for
asparagus
only
fifteen
inches
deep
will
do
well
the
plot
of
ground
should
be
where
the
water
will
not
stand
on
it
at
any
time
in
the
winter
as
it
will
on
most
level
gardens
this
will
kill
the
roots
when
a
new
bed
is
made
with
slips
from
old
plants
carefully
separate
vigorous
shoots
remove
superfluous
leaves
plant
five
inches
deep
in
rows
five
feet
apart
and
two
feet
apart
in
the
rows
keep
very
clean
of
weeds
the
first
year
some
pretty
good
though
not
heads
will
be
produced
plant
fresh
beds
each
year
and
you
will
have
good
heads
from
july
to
november
small
heads
will
grow
out
along
the
stalk
like
the
sunflower
remove
most
of
these
small
ones
when
they
are
about
the
size
of
hens
eggs
and
the
others
will
grow
large
when
the
scales
begin
to
diverge
but
before
the
blossoms
come
out
is
the
time
to
cut
them
for
use
lay
brush
over
them
to
prevent
suffocation
and
cover
with
straw
in
winter
to
protect
from
severest
cold
too
much
warmth
however
is
more
injurious
than
frost
much
like
asparagus
remove
from
each
plant
all
the
stocks
but
two
or
three
of
the
best
those
removed
are
good
for
a
new
bed
a
bed
properly
made
will
last
four
or
five
years
to
save
seed
bend
down
a
few
good
heads
so
as
to
prevent
water
from
standing
in
them
tie
them
to
a
stake
until
the
seed
is
matured
but
like
early
york
cabbage
imported
seed
is
better
the
usual
way
of
serving
them
is
the
full
heads
boiled
in
italy
the
small
heads
are
cut
up
with
oil
salt
and
pepper
this
vegetable
would
be
a
valuable
accession
to
american
kitchen
gardens
ashes
are
one
of
the
best
applications
to
the
soil
for
almost
all
plants
leeched
ashes
are
a
valuable
manure
but
not
equal
to
unleached
few
articles
about
a
house
or
farm
should
be
saved
with
greater
care
be
as
choice
of
them
as
of
your
small
change
they
are
worth
three
times
as
much
on
the
land
as
they
can
be
sold
for
other
purposes
on
corn
at
first
hoeing
they
are
nearly
equal
to
plaster
on
onions
and
vines
they
promote
the
growth
and
keep
off
the
insects
sprinkle
on
dry
when
plants
are
damp
but
not
too
wet
do
not
put
wet
ashes
on
plants
or
water
while
the
ashes
are
on
it
will
kill
them
mix
ashes
and
plaster
with
other
manures
and
their
power
will
be
greatly
increased
mixed
in
manure
of
they
accelerate
the
heat
on
sour
land
they
are
equal
to
lime
for
correcting
the
acidity
asparagus
this
is
a
universal
favorite
in
the
vegetable
garden
by
the
application
of
sand
and
compost
the
soil
should
be
kept
loose
to
allow
the
sprouts
to
spring
easily
from
the
crowns
propagation
is
best
effected
by
seed
transplanting
after
one
year
growth
older
roots
divided
and
transplanted
are
of
some
value
but
not
equal
to
young
roots
nor
will
they
last
as
long
of
the
for
an
is
most
important
to
success
dig
a
trench
on
one
edge
of
the
plat
designed
for
the
bed
and
the
length
of
it
eighteen
inches
wide
and
two
feet
deep
put
in
the
bottom
one
foot
of
good
manure
and
tread
down
then
spade
eighteen
inches
more
by
the
side
of
and
as
deep
as
the
other
throwing
the
soil
upon
the
manure
in
the
trench
fill
with
manure
and
proceed
as
before
and
so
until
the
whole
plat
has
been
trenched
then
wheel
the
earth
from
the
first
ditch
to
the
other
side
and
fill
into
the
last
trench
thus
making
all
level
if
there
is
danger
that
water
will
stand
in
the
bottom
drain
by
a
blind
ditch
if
this
is
objected
to
as
too
expensive
let
it
be
remembered
that
such
a
bed
with
a
little
annual
will
be
good
for
twenty
years
which
is
the
age
at
which
begin
to
deteriorate
then
a
new
bed
should
be
ready
to
take
its
place
mark
the
plat
into
beds
five
feet
wide
leaving
paths
two
feet
wide
between
them
in
each
bed
put
four
rows
lengthwise
which
will
be
just
fifteen
inches
apart
and
set
plants
fifteen
inches
apart
in
the
row
dig
a
trench
six
inches
wide
and
six
inches
deep
for
each
row
put
an
inch
of
rich
mould
in
the
bottom
set
the
plants
on
the
mould
with
the
roots
spread
naturally
with
the
ends
pointing
a
little
downward
be
very
particular
about
the
position
of
the
roots
fill
the
trench
and
round
it
up
a
little
with
soil
and
fine
manure
the
bed
is
then
perfect
and
will
improve
for
many
years
in
the
fall
after
the
frost
has
killed
the
stalks
cut
them
down
and
burn
them
on
the
bed
cover
the
bed
with
fine
rotted
manure
to
the
depth
of
two
inches
and
one
salt
to
each
square
rod
as
soon
as
frost
is
out
in
spring
with
a
fork
work
the
into
the
soil
to
the
depth
of
four
inches
and
stir
the
soil
to
the
depth
of
eight
inches
between
the
rows
using
care
not
to
touch
the
crowns
of
the
roots
with
the
fork
should
never
be
performed
until
the
third
year
set
out
the
plants
when
one
year
old
let
them
grow
one
year
in
the
bed
and
the
next
year
they
will
be
fit
to
cut
cut
all
the
shoots
at
a
suitable
age
up
to
the
last
days
of
june
the
shoots
should
be
regularly
cut
just
below
the
surface
when
they
are
four
or
six
inches
high
if
you
are
tempted
to
cut
after
the
of
june
leave
two
or
three
thrifty
shoots
to
each
root
to
grow
up
for
seed
or
you
will
weaken
the
plants
and
they
will
die
in
winter
this
is
the
reason
why
so
many
vacancies
are
seen
in
many
asparagus
beds
this
plant
may
be
forced
in
hotbeds
so
as
to
yield
an
abundance
of
good
shoots
long
before
they
will
start
in
the
open
air
affording
an
early
luxury
to
those
who
can
afford
it
this
vegetable
is
equal
or
superior
to
green
peas
and
by
taking
all
the
pains
recommended
above
in
the
beginning
an
abundance
can
be
raised
for
twenty
years
on
the
same
bed
at
a
very
trifling
cost
early
radishes
and
other
vegetables
can
be
raised
between
the
rows
without
any
harm
to
the
asparagus
balm
this
is
a
medicinal
plant
very
useful
and
easily
raised
a
strong
infusion
of
the
leaves
drank
freely
for
some
time
by
a
nervous
hypochondriacal
person
is
perhaps
better
than
any
other
medicine
it
is
also
good
in
flatulency
and
fevers

barberries
a
prickly
shrub
from
five
to
ten
feet
high
growing
wild
in
this
country
and
in
europe
on
poor
hard
soils
or
in
moist
situations
by
walls
stones
or
fences
its
is
by
seeds
suckers
or
offshoots
this
shrub
is
used
for
jellies
tarts
pickles
preserves
made
of
equal
parts
of
barberry
and
sweet
apples
or
of
fine
are
very
superior
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
shrubs
for
hedge
the
bark
has
much
of
the
tannin
principle
and
with
the
wood
is
used
for
coloring
yellow
shrub
blossoms
and
fruit
are
quite
ornamental
forming
a
beautiful
hedge
but
rather
inclined
to
spread
will
do
well
on
any
land
and
in
any
situation
the
discussion
in
new
england
about
its
blasting
contiguous
fields
of
grain
is
about
as
sensible
as
the
old
witchcraft
mania
every
garden
should
have
two
or
three
barley
does
best
on
land
which
was
hoed
the
previous
year
if
properly
tilled
such
land
is
rich
free
from
weeds
and
easily
pulverized
sod
plowed
deep
in
the
fall
rolled
early
in
the
spring
well
harrowed
the
seed
sown
and
harrowed
in
and
all
rolled
level
will
produce
a
good
crop
two
bushels
of
seed
should
be
sowed
on
an
acre
unless
the
land
be
very
rich
in
that
case
one
less
essential
to
a
good
crop
is
rain
about
the
time
of
heading
and
filling
hence
early
sowing
is
always
surest
in
many
parts
of
the
country
it
is
of
little
use
to
sow
barley
unless
it
be
gotten
in
very
early
in
not
more
than
one
season
in
twelve
can
you
get
a
good
crop
of
barley
from
late
sowing
in
all
the
middle
and
western
states
barley
is
more
favorably
affected
than
any
other
grain
by
soaking
hours
before
sowing
and
mixing
with
dry
ashes
a
weak
solution
of
nitre
is
best
for
soaking
the
seed
are
two
four
and
six
rowed
the
grows
the
tallest
and
is
most
conveniently
harvested
it
is
controverted
whether
the
variety
yields
the
largest
crop
to
the
acre
if
the
weather
be
dry
and
the
worms
attack
the
young
plants
rolling
when
two
or
three
inches
high
with
a
heavy
roller
will
save
and
increase
the
crop
rolling
is
a
great
help
to
the
harvesting
as
it
levels
the
surface
should
always
be
attended
to
just
as
it
turns
but
by
all
means
before
the
straw
becomes
dry
if
it
stands
up
cut
with
cradle
or
reaper
and
bind
if
lodged
cut
with
a
scythe
and
cure
in
small
cocks
like
clover
standing
until
very
ripe
or
lying
scattered
until
quite
dry
is
very
wasteful
are
all
the
way
from
fifteen
to
seventy
bushels
to
the
acre
according
to
season
and
cultivation
reasonable
care
will
secure
an
average
annual
crop
of
or
fifty
bushels
per
acre
which
makes
it
a
profitable
crop
while
the
demand
continues
it
is
a
good
crop
for
ground
feed
for
all
animals
the
beards
being
a
little
troublesome
when
fed
whole
the
straw
is
one
of
the
very
best
for
animals
barley
requires
the
use
of
the
land
only
ninety
days
leaving
it
in
good
condition
for
for
malting
and
for
food
for
men
and
beasts
it
makes
handsome
flour
and
good
bread
hulled
it
is
a
better
article
of
food
than
rice
it
succeeds
well
on
land
not
stiff
and
tenacious
enough
for
wheat
or
moist
and
cool
enough
for
oats
if
farmers
should
raise
only
for
malt
the
nation
would
become
drunk
and
poor
on
beer
and
the
market
would
be
ruined
but
raised
as
food
it
is
one
of
the
most
profitable
agricultural
products
barns
a
barn
should
always
front
the
north
the
yard
for
stock
should
be
on
the
south
side
with
tight
fences
for
protection
on
the
east
and
west
as
this
is
designed
for
winter
use
it
is
a
great
saving
of
comfort
to
the
creatures
the
should
be
hollowed
out
by
excavation
until
four
or
five
feet
lower
in
the
centre
than
on
the
edges
the
border
should
be
nearly
level
inclining
slightly
toward
the
centre
to
allow
the
liquid
in
the
yard
to
run
into
it
for
purposes
of
manure
the
front
of
a
barn
should
be
on
the
summit
of
a
small
rise
of
ground
to
allow
water
to
run
away
from
the
door
to
prevent
mud
in
hilly
countries
it
is
very
convenient
to
build
barns
by
hills
so
as
to
allow
hay
and
grain
to
be
drawn
in
near
the
top
and
be
thrown
down
instead
of
being
pitched
up
these
general
principles
are
sufficient
for
all
ordinary
barns
those
who
are
able
to
build
expensive
barns
had
better
build
them
circular
eight
or
sixteen
square
and
one
hundred
feet
in
diameter
the
lower
part
to
top
of
stable
of
stone
let
the
stable
extend
all
around
next
to
the
wall
and
a
floor
over
the
stable
that
teams
may
be
driven
all
around
to
pitch
into
the
bays
and
upon
the
mows
and
scaffolds
at
every
point
thus
teams
may
go
round
and
out
the
door
at
which
they
entered
such
a
floor
will
accommodate
several
teams
at
the
same
time
the
cellar
should
be
in
the
centre
surrounded
by
the
stable
such
a
cellar
would
never
freeze
and
would
hold
roots
enough
for
one
hundred
head
of
cattle
which
the
stable
would
easily
accommodate
let
the
mangers
be
around
next
the
cellar
for
convenience
of
feeding
such
a
barn
would
be
more
convenient
for
a
dairy
of
one
hundred
cows
or
for
of
cattle
than
any
other
form
it
would
cost
no
more
than
many
barns
in
western
new
york
that
are
not
half
as
convenient
beans
these
are
divided
into
two
classes
pole
and
bush
beans
they
are
subdivided
into
many
varieties
we
omit
the
english
or
as
being
less
valuable
for
any
purpose
than
our
beans
or
peas
pole
beans
are
troublesome
to
raise
and
are
only
grown
on
account
of
excellence
of
quality
and
to
have
successive
gatherings
from
the
same
vines
pole
beans
are
only
used
for
horticultural
purposes
for
general
culture
there
are
three
varieties
of
white
small
medium
and
large
of
all
known
beans
we
prefer
the
medium
white
the
china
bean
white
with
a
red
face
is
an
early
variety
all
ripen
nearly
at
the
same
time
it
cooks
almost
as
soon
as
a
potato
and
is
good
for
the
table
but
it
is
less
productive
and
less
saleable
because
not
wholly
white
for
planting
among
corn
as
for
a
very
late
crop
this
bean
is
valuable
because
it
matures
in
so
short
a
time
good
beans
may
be
raised
among
corn
without
injury
to
the
this
can
only
be
done
when
it
is
designed
to
cultivate
the
corn
but
one
way
many
fail
in
attempts
to
grow
beans
among
corn
by
planting
them
at
first
hoeing
the
corn
having
so
much
the
start
will
shade
the
beans
and
nearly
destroy
them
but
plant
at
the
same
time
of
the
corn
and
they
will
mature
before
the
corn
will
shade
them
much
and
not
be
in
the
way
even
of
the
ordinary
crop
of
pumpkins
but
land
in
this
way
at
any
time
is
of
very
doubtful
utility
a
separate
plat
of
ground
for
each
crop
in
nearly
all
cases
is
the
most
economical
to
raise
a
good
crop
of
beans
prepare
the
soil
as
thoroughly
as
for
any
other
crop
beans
will
mature
on
land
so
poor
and
hard
as
to
be
almost
worthless
for
other
crops
but
a
rich
mellow
soil
is
as
good
for
beans
as
anything
else
though
not
so
indispensable
drill
in
with
a
planter
as
near
together
as
possible
and
allow
a
cultivator
to
pass
between
them
one
bushel
to
the
acre
on
ordinary
land
and
three
fourths
of
a
bushel
on
very
rich
land
is
about
the
quantity
of
seed
requisite
hoe
and
cultivate
them
while
young
late
cultivation
is
useless
more
so
than
on
most
other
crops
beans
should
not
be
much
hilled
in
hoeing
and
should
never
be
worked
when
wet
all
plants
with
a
rough
stalk
like
the
bean
potato
and
vine
are
greatly
injured
sometimes
ruined
by
having
the
earth
stirred
around
them
when
they
are
wet
or
even
damp
beans
are
usually
pulled
this
should
be
done
when
the
latest
pods
are
but
not
dry
place
them
in
small
bunches
on
the
ground
with
the
roots
up
if
the
weather
be
dry
they
need
not
be
moved
until
time
to
draw
them
in
if
the
weather
be
damp
they
should
be
stacked
loosely
in
small
stacks
around
poles
and
covered
with
straw
on
the
top
to
shed
rain
always
haul
in
when
very
dry
avoid
stacking
if
possible
for
they
are
always
wasted
rapidly
by
moving
in
drawing
in
keep
the
rack
under
them
covered
with
blankets
to
save
those
that
shell
in
pulling
beans
be
sure
and
take
hold
below
the
pods
otherwise
the
pods
will
crack
and
although
no
harm
appears
then
to
be
done
yet
when
they
dry
every
pod
that
has
been
squeezed
by
pulling
will
turn
wrong
side
out
and
the
contents
be
wasted
if
your
beans
are
part
ripe
and
the
remainder
green
and
it
is
necessary
to
pull
them
to
save
the
early
ones
or
guard
against
frost
when
the
ripe
ones
are
dry
thrash
them
lightly
this
will
shell
all
the
ripe
ones
and
none
of
the
green
ones
put
the
straw
upon
a
scaffold
and
thrash
again
in
winter
thus
you
will
save
all
and
have
beautiful
beans
should
always
be
kept
dry
for
sheep
in
winter
it
is
equal
to
hay
there
are
many
varieties
a
few
of
which
only
should
be
cultivated
having
the
best
there
is
no
object
in
raising
an
inferior
quality
the
best
early
is
the
early
mohawk
it
will
stand
a
pretty
smart
without
injury
comes
early
and
is
good
early
yellow
early
black
and
quaker
or
are
also
early
and
good
refugee
or
are
the
best
known
have
a
round
crisp
full
succulent
pod
come
as
soon
as
the
mohawks
are
out
of
the
way
and
are
very
productive
planted
in
august
they
are
excellent
until
frost
the
very
best
for
pickling
for
an
early
we
recommend
the
china
the
white
kidney
and
numerous
other
varieties
are
less
certain
and
productive
are
numerous
the
true
lima
very
large
greenish
when
ripe
and
dry
is
the
richest
bean
known
is
nearly
as
good
in
winter
cooked
in
the
same
way
as
when
shelled
green
they
are
very
productive
continuing
in
blossom
till
killed
by
frost
in
warm
countries
they
grow
for
years
making
a
tree
or
growing
like
a
large
grapevine
the
london
horticultural
called
also
speckled
cranberry
and
wild
goose
is
a
very
rich
variety
the
only
objection
is
the
difficulty
of
shelling
one
only
can
be
removed
at
once
because
of
the
tenderness
of
the
pod
the
carolina
or
butter
bean
often
passes
for
the
lima
it
has
similar
pods
the
bean
is
of
similar
shape
but
always
white
instead
of
greenish
like
the
lima
and
smaller
earlier
and
of
inferior
quality
the
scarlet
runner
formerly
only
grown
as
an
ornament
on
account
of
its
great
profusion
of
scarlet
blossoms
continuing
until
frost
is
a
very
productive
variety
pods
very
large
and
very
succulent
making
an
excellent
a
rich
variety
when
dry
but
objectionable
on
account
of
their
dark
color
the
red
and
the
white
cranberries
dutch
caseknife
and
many
other
varieties
have
good
qualities
but
are
inferior
to
those
mentioned
above

be
forwarded
in

put
on

a

better
than
a

nearly
twice

has
been
pursued
with
interest
from
remote

at

the
number
of
treatises
on
this
subject
before
his
time
at
between
five
and
six
hundred
as
that
was
two
hundred
and
eight
years
ago
the
number
has
probably
increased
to
two
thousand
or
more
we
have
some
knowledge
of
the
character
of
these
early
works
as
far
back
as
democritus
four
hundred
and
sixty
years
before
the
christian
era
the
great
men
of
antiquity
gave
particular
attention
to
study
and
writing
on
the
among

richardson
langstroth
and
a
host
of
others
for
the
first
two
thousand
years
from
the
date
of
these
works
the
bee
was
treated
mainly
as
a
curious
insect
rather
than
as
a
source
of
profit
and
luxury
to
man
and
although
palestine
was
eulogized
as
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
before
the
hebrews
took
possession
of
it
yet
the
science
of
was
wholly
unknown
in
the
earliest
attention
to
bees
they
were
supposed
to
originate
in
the
concentrated
aroma
of
the
sweetest
and
most
beautiful
flowers
virgil
and
others
of
his
time
supposed
them
to
come
from
the
carcasses
of
dead
animals
but
the
remarkable
experiments
of
huber
sixty
years
ago
developed
many
facts
respecting
their
origin
and
economy
subsequent
observers
have
added
still
more
to
the
stock
of
our
knowledge
respecting
these
wonderful
creatures
the
different
stages
of
growth
from
the
minute
egg
of
the
queen
to
a
full
grown
bee
and
the
precise
time
occupied
by
each
are
well
established
the
three
classes
of
bees
in
every
perfect
colony
and
the
offices
of
each
their
mechanical
skill
in
constructing
the
different
sized
and
shaped
cells
for
honey
for
raising
drones
workers
and
queens
all
differing
according
to
the
purposes
for
which
they
are
intended
the
wars
of
the
queens
and
their
sovereignty
over
their
respective
colonies
the
methods
by
which
will
raise
a
young
queen
when
the
old
one
is
destroyed
out
of
the
larvae
of
common
bees
the
peculiar
construction
and
situation
of
the
queen
cells
and
above
all
the
royal
jelly
differing
from
everything
else
in
the
hive
which
they
manufacture
for
the
food
of
young
queens
the
manner
in
which
they
ventilate
their
hives
by
a
swift
motion
of
their
wings
causing
the
buzzing
noise
they
make
in
a
summer
evening
their
method
of
repairing
broken
comb
and
building
fortifications
before
their
entrances
at
certain
times
to
keep
out
the
sphinx
all
these
curious
matters
are
treated
fully
in
many
of
our
works
on
bees
but
we
must
forego
the
pleasure
of
presenting
these
at
length
it
being
our
sole
object
to
enable
all
who
follow
our
directions
so
to
manage
bees
as
to
render
them
profitable
in
preparing
the
brief
directions
that
follow
we
have
most
carefully
studied
all
the
works
american
and
foreign
to
which
we
could
get
access
between
this
article
and
the
best
of
those
works
there
will
be
found
a
general
agreement
except
as
it
respects
beehives
we
present
views
of
hives
that
we
are
not
aware
have
ever
been
written
the
original
idea
or
new
principle
which
consists
in
constructing
the
hive
with
the
entrance
near
the
top
was
suggested
to
us
by
samuel
pierce
of
troy
who
is
the
great
american
inventor
of
and
stoves
we
have
carefully
considered
the
principle
in
its
various
relations
to
the
habits
of
the
bee
and
believe
it
correct
to
most
of
our
late
works
on
we
have
one
serious
objection
it
is
that
they
bear
on
their
face
the
evidence
of
having
been
written
to
make
money
by
promoting
the
sale
of
some
patent
hive
these
works
all
have
a
little
in
common
that
is
interesting
the
remainder
seems
designed
to
oppose
some
former
patent
and
commend
a
new
one
they
thus
swell
their
volumes
to
a
troublesome
and
expensive
size
with
that
which
is
of
no
use
to
practical
men
a
work
made
to
fight
a
patent
or
to
sell
one
can
not
be
reliable
the
requisites
to
successful
are
the
following
always
have
large
strong
swarms
such
only
are
able
successfully
to
contend
with
their
enemies
this
is
done
by
uniting
weak
swarms
or
sending
back
a
young
feeble
swarm
when
it
comes
out
as
herein
after
directed
use
hives
in
too
large
hives
bees
find
it
difficult
to
guard
their
territories
they
also
store
up
more
honey
than
they
need
and
yield
less
to
the
cultivator
the
main
box
should
be
one
foot
square
by
fifteen
inches
high
make
hives
of
new
boards
plane
smooth
and
paint
white
on
the
outside
the
usual
direction
is
to
leave
the
inside
rough
to
aid
in
holding
up
the
honey
but
to
plane
the
inside
edges
so
as
to
make
close
joints
we
counsel
to
plane
the
inside
of
the
hive
smooth
and
draw
a
fine
saw
lightly
length
wise
of
the
boards
to
make
the
comb
adhere
this
will
be
a
great
saving
of
the
time
of
bees
when
it
is
worth
the
most
in
gathering
honey
they
always
carry
out
all
the
sawdust
from
the
inside
of
their
hives
better
save
their
time
by
planing
it
off
to
prevent
robberies
among
bees
when
a
weak
colony
is
attacked
close
their
entrances
so
that
but
one
bee
can
pass
at
once
and
they
will
then
take
care
of
themselves
to
prevent
a
disposition
to
pillage
place
all
your
hives
in
actual
contact
on
the
sides
and
make
a
communication
between
them
but
not
large
enough
to
allow
bees
to
pass
this
will
give
the
same
scent
to
the
whole
and
make
them
feel
like
one
family
bees
distinguish
strangers
only
by
the
smell
hence
so
connected
they
will
not
quarrel
or
pillage
comb
is
usually
regarded
better
for
not
being
more
than
two
or
three
years
old
the
usual
theory
is
that
cells
fill
up
by
repeated
use
and
becoming
smaller
render
the
bees
raised
in
them
diminutive
this
is
not
probable
as
a
known
habit
of
the
bee
is
to
clean
out
the
cells
before
reusing
them
huber
demonstrated
that
bees
raised
in
which
are
always
larger
than
for
workers
grew
no
larger
than
in
their
own
natural
cells
and
as
bees
build
their
cells
the
right
size
at
first
it
is
probable
they
keep
them
so
quinby
assures
us
that
bees
have
been
grown
twenty
years
in
the
same
comb
and
that
the
last
were
as
large
as
the
first
but
for
other
reasons
it
is
better
to
change
the
comb
in
all
ordinary
cases
it
is
better
to
transfer
the
swarm
to
a
new
hive
every
third
year
many
think
it
best
to
use
hives
composed
of
three
sections
seven
and
a
half
inches
deep
each
screwed
together
with
strips
of
wood
on
the
sides
and
the
top
screwed
on
that
it
may
easily
be
removed
thick
paper
or
muslin
should
be
pasted
around
on
the
places
of
intersection
to
guard
against
enemies
the
two
lower
sections
only
allowed
to
contain
bees
the
upper
one
being
designed
for
the
to
be
removed
each
spring
after
two
years
old
the
lower
section
is
taken
out
and
a
new
one
put
on
the
top
the
cover
of
the
old
one
having
been
first
removed
this
is
the
old
pyramidal
beehive
which
is
the
title
of
a
treatise
on
bees
by
ducouedic
translated
from
the
french
and
abridged
by
silas
dinsmore
in
this
has
recently
been
revived
and
patented
as
a
new
thing
we
think
with
quinby
that
these
hives
are
too
expensive
and
too
complicated
and
that
the
great
mass
of
cultivators
will
succeed
best
with
hives
of
simple
construction
allowing
bees
to
swarm
in
their
own
time
and
way
is
better
than
all
artificial
multiplication
of
colonies
if
there
are
no
small
trees
near
the
apiary
place
bushes
upon
which
the
bees
will
usually
light
when
they
come
out
if
they
seem
determined
to
go
away
without
lighting
throw
sand
or
dust
among
them
this
produces
confusion
and
causes
them
to
settle
near
the
practice
of
ringing
bells
and
drumming
on
tin
is
usually
ridiculed
but
we
believe
it
to
be
useful
and
that
on
philosophic
principles
the
object
to
be
secured
is
to
confuse
the
swarm
and
drown
the
voice
of
the
queen
the
bees
move
only
with
their
queen
hence
if
anything
prevents
them
from
hearing
her
confusion
follows
and
the
swarm
lights
therefore
any
noise
among
them
may
answer
the
purpose
and
save
the
swarm
to
hive
bees
place
them
on
a
clean
white
cloth
and
set
the
hive
over
them
raised
an
inch
or
two
by
blocks
under
the
corners
it
is
said
that
a
little
sweetened
water
or
honey
applied
to
the
inside
of
the
hive
will
incline
the
bees
to
remain
the
best
preparation
is
to
fasten
a
piece
of
new
white
comb
on
the
top
of
the
inside
of
the
hive
this
is
done
by
dipping
the
end
of
a
piece
of
comb
in
melted
beeswax
and
sticking
it
to
the
top
bees
should
never
be
allowed
to
send
off
more
than
two
colonies
in
one
season
to
restrict
them
to
one
is
still
better
excessive
swarming
is
a
precursor
of
destruction
rather
than
an
evidence
as
usually
regarded
of
prosperity
a
given
number
of
bees
will
make
far
less
honey
in
two
hives
than
in
one
unless
they
are
so
numerous
as
greatly
to
crowd
the
hive
when
a
late
swarm
comes
out
take
away
the
queen
and
they
will
immediately
return
any
one
may
easily
find
the
queen
she
is
always
in
the
centre
of
the
bunch
into
which
the
swarm
collects
on
lighting
if
they
form
two
or
three
clusters
it
is
because
they
have
that
number
of
queens
then
all
the
queens
should
be
destroyed
the
following
cuts
of
the
three
classes
of
bees
will
enable
one
to
distinguish
the
queen
illustration
working
bee
queen
drone
the
queen
is
sometimes
but
not
always
larger
than
the
common
bee
but
her
body
is
always
longer
and
blackish
above
and
yellowish
underneath
to
unite
any
two
swarms
together
turn
the
hive
you
wish
to
empty
and
place
the
one
into
which
you
would
have
them
go
on
the
top
of
the
other
with
their
mouths
together
then
tie
a
cloth
around
at
the
place
of
intersection
to
prevent
the
egress
of
the
bees
gently
rap
the
lower
hive
on
all
sides
near
the
bottom
gradually
rising
until
you
reach
the
top
of
the
lower
hive
and
all
the
bees
will
go
into
the
upper
one
in
the
same
way
it
is
easy
to
remove
a
colony
into
a
new
hive
whenever
you
think
they
need
changing
this
should
be
performed
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
need
occupy
no
more
than
half
an
hour
the
hive
should
then
be
put
in
its
place
uniting
weak
new
swarms
may
be
done
whenever
they
come
out
but
changing
a
swarm
from
an
old
hive
to
a
new
one
should
be
performed
as
early
as
the
middle
of
june
if
moths
get
in
change
hives
at
any
time
when
it
is
warm
enough
for
bees
to
work
and
give
them
all
the
honey
in
their
old
hive
if
you
discover
moths
too
late
for
the
bees
to
build
comb
in
a
new
hive
take
the
queen
from
the
hive
infested
with
moths
and
place
it
where
the
bees
will
unite
with
another
colony
and
feed
them
all
the
honey
from
the
deserted
hive
this
or
the
destruction
of
the
bees
and
saving
the
honey
is
always
necessary
when
are
in
possession
unless
they
are
so
near
the
bottom
that
all
the
comb
around
them
may
be
cut
out
bees
are
fond
of
salt
always
keep
some
on
a
board
near
them
they
also
need
water
if
a
rivulet
runs
near
the
apiary
it
is
well
if
not
place
water
in
shallow
pans
with
pebbles
in
them
on
which
the
bees
can
stand
to
drink
change
the
water
daily
it
is
too
late
to
speak
of
the
improvidence
of
killing
bees
to
get
their
honey
use
boxes
of
any
size
or
construction
you
choose
in
common
hives
boxes
should
be
attached
to
the
sides
and
not
placed
on
the
top
it
is
a
wasteful
tax
upon
the
time
and
strength
of
loaded
bees
to
make
them
travel
through
the
whole
length
of
the
hive
into
boxes
on
the
top
place
boxes
as
near
as
possible
to
their
entrance
or
below
that
entrance
bees
should
be
kept
out
of
the
boxes
until
they
have
pretty
well
filled
the
hive
or
they
may
begin
to
raise
young
bees
in
the
boxes
successfully
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
matters
in
two
evils
are
to
be
guarded
against
dampness
and
suffocation
excessive
dampness
sometimes
causes
frost
about
the
entrance
that
fills
it
up
and
suffocation
ensues
sometimes
snow
falls
or
is
blown
over
the
entrance
and
the
bees
die
in
a
few
hours
for
the
want
of
air
many
large
colonies
with
plenty
of
honey
are
thus
destroyed
dampness
is
very
injurious
to
bees
on
other
accounts
in
a
good
there
is
no
danger
from
snow
and
little
from
dampness
bees
not
having
honey
enough
for
winter
should
be
fed
in
pleasant
fall
weather
after
they
have
nearly
completed
the
labors
of
the
season
weighing
hives
is
unnecessary
a
moderate
degree
of
judgment
will
determine
whether
a
swarm
has
a
sufficient
store
for
winter
if
not
feed
them
never
give
bees
dry
sugar
they
take
up
their
food
as
an
elephant
does
water
in
his
trunk
it
therefore
should
be
in
a
liquid
form
boil
good
sugar
for
ten
minutes
in
ale
or
beer
leaving
it
about
as
thick
as
honey
put
it
in
a
feed
trough
which
should
be
fasten
together
thin
slats
one
fourth
of
an
inch
apart
so
as
to
fit
the
inside
of
the
feed
trough
and
lie
on
the
surface
of
the
liquid
so
as
to
rise
and
fall
with
it
put
this
in
a
box
and
attach
it
to
the
hive
as
for
taking
and
the
bees
will
work
it
all
up
put
it
tempts
other
bees
and
may
lead
to
quarrels
and
robbery
it
is
not
generally
known
that
a
good
swarm
of
bees
may
be
destroyed
by
feeding
them
plenty
of
honey
early
in
the
spring
they
carry
it
in
and
fill
up
their
empty
cells
and
leave
no
room
for
raising
young
bees
hence
the
whole
is
ruined
for
want
of
inhabitants
to
take
the
places
of
those
that
get
destroyed
or
die
of
age
to
winter
bees
well
utterly
exclude
the
light
during
all
the
cold
weather
until
it
becomes
so
warm
that
they
will
not
get
so
chilled
when
out
that
they
can
not
return
intense
cold
is
not
injurious
to
bees
provided
they
are
kept
in
the
hive
and
are
dry
a
large
swarm
will
not
eat
two
pounds
of
honey
during
the
whole
cold
winter
if
kept
from
the
light
when
tempted
out
every
warm
day
they
come
into
the
sunshine
and
empty
themselves
and
return
to
consume
large
quantities
of
honey
kept
in
the
dark
they
are
nearly
torpid
eat
but
a
mere
trifle
and
winter
well
whatever
your
hive
or
house
then
keep
your
bees
entirely
from
the
light
in
cold
weather
this
is
the
only
reason
why
bees
keep
so
well
in
a
dark
dry
cellar
or
buried
in
the
ground
with
something
around
them
to
preserve
them
from
moisture
and
a
conductor
through
the
surface
to
admit
fresh
air
it
is
not
because
it
keeps
out
the
cold
but
because
it
excludes
the
light
and
renders
the
bees
inactive
gilmore
patent
is
a
great
improvement
on
this
account
of
the
diseases
of
bees
such
as
dysentery
we
shall
not
treat
all
that
can
profitably
be
done
to
remedy
these
evils
is
secured
by
salt
water
and
food
as
given
above
but
the
great
question
in
is
how
to
prevent
the
depredation
of
the
to
this
subject
much
study
has
been
given
and
respecting
it
many
theories
have
been
advanced
the
following
suggestions
are
to
us
the
most
satisfactory
the
miller
that
deposites
the
egg
which
soon
changes
to
the
worm
so
destructive
in
the
beehive
commences
to
fly
about
at
dark
in
almost
every
they
are
seen
about
the
lights
in
the
evening
they
are
still
during
all
the
day
they
are
remarkably
attracted
by
lights
in
the
evening
hence
our
first
rule
place
a
teasaucer
of
melted
lard
or
oil
with
a
piece
of
cotton
flannel
for
a
wick
in
or
near
the
apiary
at
dusk
light
it
and
allow
it
to
burn
till
near
morning
expiring
before
daylight
this
done
every
night
during
the
month
of
june
will
be
very
effectual
keep
grass
and
weeds
away
from
the
immediate
vicinity
of
your
apiary
let
the
ground
be
kept
clean
and
smooth
this
destroys
many
of
the
of
the
miller
and
forces
him
away
to
spend
the
day
this
precaution
has
many
other
advantages
keep
large
strong
colonies
they
will
be
able
to
guard
their
territories
and
contend
with
this
and
all
other
enemies
never
have
any
opening
in
a
beehive
near
the
bottom
during
the
season
of
millers
see
beehive
let
the
openings
be
so
small
that
only
one
or
two
bees
can
pass
at
once
to
accommodate
the
bees
increase
the
number
of
openings
millers
will
seldom
enter
among
a
strong
swarm
with
such
openings
all
around
the
bottom
it
should
be
so
tight
that
no
crevice
can
be
found
in
which
a
miller
can
deposite
an
egg
better
plaster
around
closely
with
some
substance
the
place
of
contact
between
the
hive
and
the
board
on
which
it
stands
and
keep
it
entirely
tight
during
the
time
in
which
the
millers
are
active
if
through
negligence
worms
have
got
into
a
hive
examine
it
at
once
and
if
they
are
near
the
bottom
only
within
sight
and
reach
cut
out
the
comb
around
them
and
remove
them
from
the
hive
if
this
is
not
practicable
transfer
the
swarm
to
a
new
hive
or
unite
it
with
another
without
delay
the
great
remedy
for
the
moth
is
in
the
right
construction
of
a
beehive
whatever
the
form
of
the
hive
you
use
have
the
entrance
within
three
or
four
inches
of
the
top
millers
are
afraid
of
bees
they
will
not
go
among
them
unless
they
are
in
a
weak
dispirited
condition
they
steal
into
the
hive
when
the
bees
are
quiet
up
among
the
comb
or
when
they
hang
out
in
warm
weather
but
are
still
and
quiet
if
the
hive
be
open
on
all
sides
as
is
so
often
recommended
the
miller
enters
on
some
side
where
the
bees
are
not
now
bees
are
apt
to
go
to
the
upper
part
of
the
hive
and
comb
and
leave
the
lower
part
and
entrance
exposed
if
the
entrance
be
at
the
upper
part
the
bees
will
fill
it
and
be
all
about
it
a
bee
can
easily
pass
through
a
cluster
of
bees
and
enter
or
leave
a
hive
but
a
miller
will
never
undertake
it
this
then
will
be
a
perfect
safeguard
against
the
depredations
of
the
moth
this
hive
is
better
on
every
account
moisture
rises
in
a
hive
open
only
at
the
bottom
it
is
likely
to
rise
to
the
top
of
the
hive
and
injure
the
bees
with
the
opening
near
the
top
it
easily
escapes
the
objection
that
would
be
soonest
raised
to
this
suggestion
is
that
bees
need
a
good
circulation
of
fresh
air
and
such
a
hive
would
not
favor
it
to
this
we
reply
a
hive
open
near
the
top
secures
the
best
possible
air
to
the
swarm
any
foul
air
has
opportunity
freely
to
escape
that
peculiar
humming
heard
in
a
hive
in
hot
weather
is
produced
by
a
certain
motion
of
the
wings
of
the
bees
designed
to
expel
vitiated
air
and
admit
the
pure
by
keeping
up
a
current
in
the
daytime
when
the
weather
is
hot
you
will
see
a
few
bees
near
the
entrance
on
the
outside
and
hear
others
within
performing
this
service
and
when
fatigued
others
take
their
place
this
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
in
all
the
habits
and
instincts
of
bees
they
thus
keep
a
pure
atmosphere
in
a
crowded
hive
in
hot
weather
now
it
would
require
much
less
fanning
to
expel
bad
air
from
a
hive
open
at
the
top
than
from
one
where
all
that
air
had
to
be
forced
down
through
an
opening
at
the
bottom
this
theory
is
sustained
by
the
natural
habits
of
bees
in
their
wild
state
wild
bees
that
select
their
own
abodes
are
found
in
trees
and
crevices
of
rocks
they
usually
build
their
combs
from
their
entrance
and
their
abode
is
at
the
bottom
they
have
no
air
only
what
is
admitted
at
their
entrance
near
the
top
of
their
dwelling
and
with
no
current
of
air
only
what
they
choose
to
produce
by
fanning
the
purest
atmosphere
in
any
room
is
where
it
enters
and
passes
out
at
the
top
in
such
a
room
only
does
the
external
atmosphere
circulate
naturally
it
is
on
the
same
principle
that
bees
keep
better
buried
than
in
any
other
way
provided
only
they
are
kept
dry
yet
they
are
in
a
place
except
the
small
conductor
to
the
atmosphere
above
them
the
old
pyramidal
beehive
of
ducouedic
with
three
sections
one
above
the
other
allowing
the
removal
of
the
lower
one
each
spring
and
the
placing
of
a
new
one
on
the
top
thus
changing
the
comb
so
that
none
shall
ever
be
more
than
two
years
old
with
the
opening
always
within
three
or
four
inches
of
the
top
is
the
best
of
the
patent
hives
we
prefer
plain
simple
hives
the
general
adoption
of
this
principle
whatever
hives
are
used
would
be
a
new
era
in
the
science
of
no
beehive
should
ever
be
exposed
to
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
in
a
beehouse
a
hive
standing
alone
with
a
free
circulation
of
air
on
every
side
will
not
be
seriously
injured
by
the
sun
but
when
the
rays
are
intercepted
by
walls
or
boards
in
the
rear
and
on
the
sides
they
are
very
disastrous
other
hints
such
as
clearing
off
occasionally
in
all
seasons
except
in
the
cold
of
winter
the
bottom
board
are
matters
upon
which
we
need
not
dwell
no
cultivator
would
think
of
neglecting
them
let
no
one
be
alarmed
at
finding
dead
bees
on
the
bottom
when
clearing
out
a
hive
bees
live
only
from
five
to
seven
months
and
their
places
are
then
supplied
with
young
ones
the
above
suggestions
followed
and
a
little
care
taken
in
cultivating
the
fruits
grains
and
grasses
that
yield
the
best
flowers
for
bees
secure
uniform
in
raising
honey
this
is
one
of
the
finest
luxuries
and
what
is
a
great
desideratum
it
is
within
the
easy
reach
of
every
poor
family
even
in
all
the
rural
districts
of
the
land
good
honey
good
vegetables
and
good
fruit
like
rain
and
sunshine
may
be
the
property
of
all
the
design
of
this
volume
is
to
enable
the
poor
and
the
unlearned
to
enjoy
these
things
in
abundance
with
only
that
amount
of
care
and
labor
necessary
to
give
them
a
zest
beets
of
this
excellent
root
there
are
quite
a
number
of
varieties
yields
most
for
and
is
the
great
beet
for
feeding
to
domestic
animals
not
generally
used
for
the
table
french
sugar
or
amber
beet
is
good
for
both
in
quality
and
yield
but
it
is
not
equal
to
the
wurtzel
early
early
dwarf
blood
early
white
scarcity
and
long
blood
are
among
the
leading
garden
varieties
of
all
the
beets
three
only
need
be
cultivated
in
this
country
the
wurtzel
for
feeding
and
the
early
blood
and
long
blood
for
the
table
the
early
blood
is
the
best
through
the
whole
season
comes
early
and
can
be
easily
kept
so
as
to
be
good
for
the
table
in
the
spring
the
long
blood
is
later
and
very
much
esteemed
beets
may
be
easily
forwarded
in
hotbeds
sow
seed
early
and
transplant
in
garden
as
soon
as
the
soil
is
warm
enough
to
promote
their
growth
when
well
done
the
removal
retards
their
growth
but
little
young
beets
are
universally
esteemed
to
have
them
of
excellent
quality
during
all
the
winter
it
is
only
necessary
to
plant
on
the
last
days
of
july
if
the
weather
be
dry
water
well
so
as
to
get
them
up
and
they
will
attain
the
size
and
age
at
which
they
are
most
valued
keep
them
in
the
cellar
for
use
as
other
beets
they
will
keep
as
well
as
old
ones
make
the
soil
very
mellow
fifteen
to
eighteen
inches
deep
soil
having
a
little
sand
in
its
composition
is
always
best
even
very
sandy
land
is
good
if
it
be
sufficiently
enriched
choose
land
on
which
water
will
not
stand
in
a
wet
season
beets
endure
drought
better
than
extreme
wet
having
made
the
surface
perfectly
mellow
and
free
from
clods
weeds
and
stones
sow
in
drills
with
a
machine
for
the
purpose
two
feet
apart
this
is
wide
enough
for
a
small
cultivator
to
pass
between
them
after
planting
roll
the
surface
smooth
and
level
this
will
greatly
facilitate
early
cultivation
on
a
rough
surface
you
can
not
cultivate
small
plants
without
destroying
many
of
them
hence
the
necessity
of
straight
rows
and
thorough
rolling
the
english
books
recommend
planting
this
and
other
roots
on
ridges
for
their
climate
it
is
good
but
for
ours
it
is
bad
they
have
to
guard
against
too
much
moisture
and
we
against
drought
hence
they
should
plant
on
ridges
and
we
on
an
even
surface
to
get
the
largest
crop
plow
a
deep
furrow
for
each
row
put
in
plenty
of
good
manure
cover
it
with
the
plow
and
level
the
surface
and
plant
over
the
manure
when
well
growing
they
should
be
thinned
to
six
or
eight
inches
in
the
row
often
stirring
the
earth
while
they
are
young
is
of
great
benefit
the
quality
and
quantity
of
a
depend
much
upon
the
rapidity
of
its
growth
slow
growth
gives
harder
roots
of
worse
flavor
as
well
as
a
stinted
crop
should
be
done
just
before
severe
frosts
they
will
grow
until
frost
comes
however
early
they
were
planted
or
whatever
size
they
may
have
attained
they
grow
as
rapidly
after
light
frosts
as
at
any
time
in
the
season
but
very
severe
frosts
expose
them
to
rot
during
winter
for
table
use
is
usually
done
by
putting
in
boxes
with
moist
sand
or
the
mould
in
which
they
grew
this
excludes
air
and
if
kept
a
little
moist
will
preserve
them
perfectly
roots
are
always
better
buried
below
frost
on
a
dry
knoll
where
water
will
not
stand
in
the
pits
but
in
cold
climates
it
is
necessary
to
have
some
in
the
cellar
for
winter
use
the
common
method
of
burying
beets
and
turnips
and
all
other
roots
is
well
understood
the
only
requisites
are
a
dry
location
secured
from
frost
straw
next
the
roots
a
covering
of
earth
not
too
deep
while
the
weather
is
yet
mild
as
it
grows
cold
put
on
another
covering
of
straw
and
over
it
a
foot
of
earth
as
it
becomes
very
cold
put
on
a
load
or
two
of
barnyard
manure
this
will
save
them
beyond
the
power
of
the
coldest
winter
vast
quantities
of
roots
buried
outdoor
are
destroyed
annually
by
frost
and
there
is
no
need
of
ever
losing
a
bushel
you
they
would
not
freeze
is
not
half
as
good
as
spending
two
hours
time
in
covering
so
that
you
they
can
not
freeze
there
is
hardly
a
more
provoking
piece
of
carelessness
in
the
whole
range
of
domestic
economy
than
the
needless
loss
of
so
many
edible
roots
by
frost
table
of
beets
is
everywhere
known
their
value
for
feeding
animals
is
not
duly
appreciated
in
this
country
no
one
who
keeps
domestic
animals
or
fowls
should
fail
to
raise
a
it
is
one
of
the
surest
crops
grown
it
is
never
destroyed
by
insects
and
drought
affects
it
but
very
little
on
good
soil
beets
produce
an
enormous
weight
to
the
acre
the
lower
leaves
may
be
stripped
off
twice
during
the
season
to
feed
to
cows
or
other
stock
without
injury
to
the
crop
cows
will
give
more
milk
for
fifteen
days
fed
on
this
root
alone
than
on
any
other
feed
they
then
begin
to
get
too
fat
and
decline
in
milk
hence
they
should
be
fed
beets
and
hay
or
other
food
in
about
equal
parts
on
which
they
will
do
better
than
in
any
other
way
horses
do
better
on
equal
parts
of
beet
and
hay
than
on
ordinary
hay
and
grain
horses
fed
thus
will
fatten
needing
only
the
addition
of
a
little
ground
grain
when
working
hard
plenty
of
beets
with
a
little
other
food
makes
cows
give
milk
as
well
as
in
summer
raw
beets
cut
fine
with
a
little
milk
will
fatten
hogs
as
fast
as
boiled
potatoes
all
fowls
are
fond
of
them
chopped
fine
and
mixed
with
other
food
sheep
also
are
fond
of
them
they
are
very
valuable
to
ewes
in
the
spring
when
lambs
come
when
they
especially
need
succulent
food
the
free
use
of
this
root
by
english
farmers
is
an
important
reason
of
their
great
success
in
raising
fine
sheep
and
lambs
they
promote
the
health
of
animals
and
none
ever
tire
of
them
as
it
needs
no
cooking
it
is
the
cheapest
food
of
the
root
kind
beets
will
keep
longer
and
in
better
condition
than
any
other
root
they
never
give
any
disagreeable
flavor
to
milk
it
is
considered
established
now
that
four
pounds
of
beet
equal
in
nourishment
five
pounds
of
carrot
every
large
feeder
should
have
a
cellar
beyond
the
reach
of
frosts
and
of
large
dimensions
accessible
at
all
times
in

we
insist
upon

nor
do
they
always
exhibit
good
judgment
in

blackberry
this

grows
wild
in
great

in
many
parts

it

the
common
wild
found
by
fences
especially
in
the
margin
of
forests
in
most
parts
of
the
united
sates
is
very
valuable
for
cultivation
in
gardens
coming
in
after
the
red
raspberry
and
ripening
in
succession
until
the
blackberry
commences
it
is
highly
esteemed
cultivated
with
little
animal
manure
but
plenty
of
sawdust
old
leaves
wood
chips
and
coarse
litter
it
improves
very
much
from
its
wild
state
fruit
is
all
borne
on
bushes
of
the
previous
year
growth
hence
after
they
have
done
bearing
cut
away
the
old
bushes
to
secure
the
greatest
yield
on
rich
land
cut
off
the
tops
of
the
shoots
rising
for
next
year
fruit
when
they
are
four
or
five
feet
high
the
result
will
be
strong
shoots
from
behind
all
the
leaves
on
the
upper
part
of
the
stalk
each
of
which
will
bear
nearly
as
much
fruit
as
would
the
whole
have
done
without
clipping
a
dozen
of
these
would
occupy
but
a
small
place
in
a
border
or
by
a
wall
not
an
american
garden
should
be
found
without
them
bones
bones
are
one
of
the
most
valuable
manures
they
yield
the
phosphates
in
large
measure
on
all
land
needing
lime
they
are
very
valuable
the
heads
about
butchers
shops
will
bear
a
transportation
of
twenty
miles
to
put
upon
meadows
break
them
with
the
head
of
an
axe
and
pound
them
into
the
sod
even
with
the
surface
they
add
greatly
to
the
products
of
a
meadow
ground
they
make
one
of
the
best
manures
of
commerce
a
cheap
method
for
the
farmer
is
to
deposite
a
load
of
and
on
that
a
load
of
bones
and
alternate
each
till
he
has
used
up
all
his
bones
cover
the
last
load
of
bones
deep
with
manure
it
will
make
a
splendid
hotbed
and
the
fermentation
of
the
manure
will
dissolve
or
pulverize
the
bones
and
the
heap
will
become
one
mass
of
the
most
valuable
manure
especially
for
roots
and
vines
and
all
vegetables
requiring
a
rich
fine
manure
borecole
or
kale
there
are
some
fifteen
or
twenty
kinds

in
this
country
cultivate
as
cabbage
in
portions
of
the
middle
states
they
will
stand
the
frosts
of
winter
well
without
much
protection
further
north
they
need
protection
with
a
little
brush
and
straw
during
severe
frosts
those
grown
on
rather
hard
land
are
better
for
winter
being
less
succulent
they
endure
cold
better
cut
them
off
for
use
whenever
you
choose
they
do
not
head
like
cabbage
they
have
full
bunches
of
curled
leaves
cut
off
so
as
to
include
all
not
over
eight
inches
long
in
winter
after
having
been
pretty
well
exposed
to
the
frost
they
are
very
fine
set
out
the
stumps
early
in
spring
and
they
will
yield
a
profusion
of
delicious
sprouts
this
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
many
of
our
kitchen
gardens
broccoli
this
may
be
regarded
as
a
late
flowering
species
of
cauliflower
it
should
be
planted
and
treated
as

and
fine
heads
will
be
formed
in
the
middle

in

at
the

much
earlier
according
to

broccoli
broom
corn
cultivated
like
other
corn
only
that
this
is
more
generally
planted
in
drills
three
feet
apart
and
six
inches
in
the
drill
it
yields
more
weight
of
better
corn
to
the
acre
than
to
have
it
nearer
the
great
fault
in
raising
this
crop
is
getting
it
too
thick
the
brush
is
of
corn
cut
while
yet
so
green
that
the
seed
is
useless
but
the
brush
is
stronger
and
will
make
better
brooms
for
wear
when
the
corn
is
allowed
to
stand
until
the
seed
is
hard
though
not
till
the
brush
is
dry
the
land
should
be
rich
this
is
a
hard
exhausting
crop
for
the
soil
to
harvest
bend
down
two
feet
from
the
ground
two
rows
allowing
them
so
to
fall
across
each
other
as
to
expose
all
the
heads
cut
off
the
heads
with
six
or
eight
inches
of
the
stalk
and
place
them
on
top
of
the
bent
rows
to
dry
in
a
week
in
dry
weather
they
will
be
well
cured
and
should
be
then
spread
thin
under
cover
in
plenty
of
air
there
is
no
worse
article
to
heat
and
mould
in
large
crops
they
usually
take
off
the
seed
before
curing
it
is
much
lighter
to
handle
and
less
bulky
it
may
be
done
then
or
in
winter
as
you
prefer
the
seed
is
removed
on
a
cylinder
eighteen
inches
long
and
two
and
a
half
feet
in
diameter
having
two
hundred
wrought
nails
with
their
points
projecting
it
is
turned
by
a
crank
like
a
fanning
mill
the
corn
is
held
in
a
convenient
handful
like
flax
on
a
hatchel
where
large
quantities
are
to
be
cleaned
of
the
seed
power
is
used
to
turn
the
machine
ground
or
boiled
the
seed
makes
good
feed
for
most
animals
dry
it
has
too
hard
a
shell
fowls
with
access
to
plenty
of
gravel
do
well
on
it
is
not
a
very
profitable
crop
except
to
those
who
manufacture
their
own
corn
into
brooms
there
is
much
labor
about
it
and
considerable
hazard
of
injuring
the
crop
by
the
inexperienced
hence
young
farmers
had
generally
better
let
it
alone
there
are
two
varieties
they
may
be
forms
of
growth
from
peculiar
habits
of
culture
one
short
with
a
large
stiff
brush
running
up
through
the
middle
with
short
branches
to
the
top
called
it
is
of
no
value
the
other
is
a
long
fine
brush
the
middle
being
no
coarser
than
the
outside
it
should
be
planted
with
a
to
make
the
rows
straight
and
narrow
for
the
convenience
of
cultivation
harrowing
with
a
span
of
horses
with
a
drag
one
front
tooth
out
as
soon
as
the
corn
is
up
is
beneficial
to
the
crop
brussels
sprouts
this
is
a
species
of
cabbage
a
long
stem
runs
up
on
which
grow
numerous
in
miniature
the
centre
head
is
small
and
of
little
use
and
the
large
leaves
drop
off
early
it
will
grow
among
almost
anything
else
without
injury
to
either
it
is
raised
from
seed
like
cabbage
and
cultivated
in
all
respects
the
same
eighteen
inches
apart
each
way
is
a
proper
distance
as
the
plant
spreads
but
little
good
either
as
a
cabbage
or
when
very
small
as
greens
they
are
good
even
after
very
hard
frosts
by
forwarding
in
hotbed
in
the
spring
and
by
planting
late
ones
for
winter
they
may
be
had
most
of
the
year
if
they
are
disposed
to
run
to
seed
too
early
it
may
be
prevented
by
pulling
up
and
setting
out
again
in
the
shade
save
seed
as
from
cabbage
but
use
great
caution
that
they
are
not
near
enough
to
receive
the
farina
from
any
of
the
rest
of
the
buckthorn
this
is
the
most
valuable
of
the
thorn
tribe
for
hedge
in
this
country
it
never
suffers
from
those
enemies
that
destroy
so
much
of
the
hawthorn
this
is
also
used
for
dyeing
and
for
medicine
buckwheat
this
will
grow
well
on
almost
any
soil
even
that
too
poor
for
most
other
crops
will
yield
very
good
buckwheat
though
rich
land
is
better
for
this
as
for
all
other
crops
the
heat
of
summer
is
apt
to
blast
it
when
filling
hence
in
the
middle
states
it
is
not
best
to
sow
it
until
into
july
it
fills
well
in
cool
moist
weather
and
is
quite
a
sure
crop
if
sowed
at
the
right
time
on
poor
land
one
bushel
of
seed
is
required
for
an
acre
while
half
a
bushel
is
sufficient
on
rich
land
where
stalks
grow
large
the
blossoms
yield
to
the
very
large
quantities
of
honey
much
inferior
to
that
made
of
white
clover
it
may
be
readily
distinguished
in
the
comb
by
its
dark
color
and
peculiar
flavor
ground
it
is
good
for
most
animals
and
for
fowls
unground
mixed
with
other
grain
it
remains
long
in
land
but
it
is
a
weed
easily
killed
with
the
hoe
or
a
farmer
may
set
apart
a
small
field
for
an
annual
crop
keeping
up
the
land
by
the
application
of
three
pecks
of
plaster
per
acre
each
year
it
is
very
popular
as
human
food
and
always
made
into
pancakes
the
free
use
of
it
is
said
to
promote
eruptive
diseases
the
india
buckwheat
is
more
productive
but
of
poorer
quality
the
bran
is
the
best
article
known
to
mix
with
and

into
radish
beds
to
promote

and
kill

budding
this
is
usually
given
under
the
article
on
peaches
but
as
it
is
a
general
subject
it
should
be
in
a
separate
article
reserving
what
is
peculiar
to
the
different
fruits
to
be
noticed
under
their
respective
heads
illustration
budding
budding
small
trees
should
usually
be
performed
very
near
the
ground
and
on
a
smooth
place
any
sharp
will
do
but
a
regular
budding
knife
now
for
sale
in
most
is
preferable
cut
through
the
bark
in
the
form
of
a
horizontal
crescent
in
the
cut
split
the
bark
down
from
the
cut
three
fourths
of
an
inch
and
with
the
of
the
knife
raise
the
corners
and
edges
of
the
bark
select
a
vigorous
shoot
of
this
year
growth
but
having
buds
well
matured
select
a
bud
that
bids
fairest
to
be
a
as
will
fail
insert
the
knife
half
an
inch
below
the
bud
and
cut
upward
in
a
straight
line
severing
the
bark
and
a
thin
piece
of
the
wood
to
one
half
inch
above
the
bud
and
let
the
knife
run
out
you
then
have
a
bud
ready
for
insertion
in
cut
the
english
method
is
to
remove
the
wood
from
the
bud
before
inserting
it
this
is
attended
with
danger
to
the
vitality
of
the
bud
and
is
therefore
less
certain
of
success
and
it
is
no
better
when
it
does
succeed
hence
american
authorities
favor
inserting
the
bud
with
the
wood
remaining
insert
the
lower
end
of
this
slip
between
the
two
edges
of
the
bark
passing
the
bud
down
between
those
edges
until
the
top
of
the
slip
comes
below
the
horizontal
cut
and
remaining
contiguous
to
it
if
the
bud
slip
be
too
long
after
it
is
sufficiently
pressed
down
cut
off
the
top
so
as
to
make
a
good
fit
with
the
bark
above
the
cut
in
cut
the
lower
end
of
the
bud
will
have
raised
the
split
bark
a
little
more
to
make
room
for
itself
and
thus
will
set
very
close
to
the
stalk
tie
the
bud
in
with
a
soft
ligature
commence
at
the
bottom
of
the
split
and
wind
closely
until
the
whole
wound
is
covered
leaving
only
the
bud
exposed
in
cut
it
is
more
convenient
to
commence
at
the
top
but
it
is
less
certain
to
confine
the
slip
opposite
the
bud
in
close
contact
with
the
stalk
this
is
indispensable
to
success
we
have
often
seen
buds
adhere
well
at
the
bottom
but
stand
out
from
the
stalk
and
thus
be
ruined
of
take
thrifty
vigorous
shoots
of
this
growth
with
buds
cut
off
the
leaves
one
half
inch
from
the
stalks
in
cut
wrap
them
in
moist
moss
or
grass
or
put
them
in
sawdust
or
bury
them
one
foot
in
the
ground
the
best
yet
known
is
the
inside
bark
of
the
linden
or
american
basswood
in
june
when
the
bark
slips
easily
strip
it
from
the
tree
remove
the
coarse
outside
immerse
the
inside
bark
in
water
for
twenty
days
the
fibres
will
then
easily
separate
and
become
soft
and
pliable
as
satin
ribbon
cut
it
into
convenient
lengths
say
one
foot
and
lay
them
away
in
a
dry
state
in
which
they
will
keep
for
years
this
will
afford
good
ties

many
uses

the
is
best
after

days
the
bands
should
be
loosened
and
retied
then
if
the

is
dried
it
is
spoiled

they
will
all
be

the

draw
the

off
at
once
if
you
use

from
a

not
fully
grown
very
few
of

make
good
butter
without
keeping
everything
about
the
dairy
perfectly
clean
and
sweet
milk
should
never
stand
more
than
three
inches
deep
in
the
pans
to
raise
the
best
and
most
cream
it
should
be
set
in
an
airy
room
containing
nothing
else
butter
and
milk
will
collect
and
retain
the
flavor
of
any
other
substance
near
them
more
readily
than
anything
else
hence
milk
set
in
a
cellar
containing
onions
or
in
a
room
with
new
cheese
makes
butter
highly
flavored
with
those
articles
is
an
important
matter
it
should
be
regular
at
from
fifty
to
degrees
of
fahrenheit
thermometer
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
be
exact
in
this
matter
but
come
as
near
it
as
possible
this
can
be
well
regulated
in
a
good
cool
cellar
into
which
air
can
be
plentifully
admitted
at
pleasure
those
who
are
so
situated
that
their
can
stand
over
a
spring
with
pure
water
running
over
its
stone
floor
are
favored
those
who
will
take
pains
to
lay
ice
in
their
in
very
warm
weather
will
find
it
pay
largely
in
the
quality
and
quantity
of
their
butter
those
who
will
not
follow
either
of
the
above
directions
must
be
content
to
make
less
butter
and
of
rather
inferior
quality
out
of
the
same
quantity
of
milk
should
be
attended
to
when
the
milk
has
soured
just
enough
to
have
a
little
of
it
curdle
on
the
bottom
of
the
pan
if
it
should
nearly
all
curdle
it
would
not
be
a
serious
injury
unless
it
should
become
old
if
you
have
not
conveniences
for
keeping
milk
sufficiently
warm
in
cold
weather
place
it
over
the
stove
at
once
when
drawn
and
give
it
a
scalding
heat
and
the
cream
will
rise
in
a
much
shorter
space
of
time
and
more
plentifully
milk
should
be
strained
and
set
as
soon
as
possible
after
being
drawn
from
the
cow
and
with
the
least
possible
agitation
the
unpleasant
flavor
imparted
to
milk
from
the
food
of
the
cows
such
as
turnips
or
leeks
may
be
at
once
removed
by
adding
to
the
milk
before
straining
one
eighth
of
its
quantity
of
boiling
water
or
two
ounces
of
nitre
boiled
in
one
quart
of
water
and
bottled
and
a
small
teacupful
put
in
twelve
quarts
of
milk
will
answer
the
same
purpose
should
be
performed
with
great
care
experiments
have
demonstrated
that
the
last
drawn
from
a
cow
yields
from
six
to
sixteen
times
as
large
a
quantity
of
better
cream
than
that
first
drawn
careless
milking
will
make
the
quantity
of
butter
less
and
the
quality
inferior
while
it
dries
up
the
cows
there
are
probably
millions
of
cows
now
in
the
united
states
that
are
indifferent
milkers
from
this
very
cause
quick
and
clean
milking
from
the
time
they
first
came
in
would
have
made
them
worth
twice
as
much
for
butter
and
milk
as
they
are
now
always
milk
as
quickly
as
possible
and
without
stopping
after
you
commence
and
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
same
hour
of
the
day
leaving
a
teacupful
or
even
half
that
quantity
in
milking
each
cow
will
very
materially
lessen
the
products
of
the
dairy
and
seriously
injure
the
cows
for
future
use
great
milkers
will
yield
considerable
more
by
having
it
drawn
three
times
per
day
the
quantity
of
milk
given
by
a
cow
will
never
injure
her
provided
she
be
well
fed
as
it
takes
food
to
make
meat
so
it
does
also
to
make
milk
you
can
never
get
something
for
nothing
the
best
breeds
of
swine
cattle
or
fowls
can
not
be
fattened
without
being
well
fed
so
the
best
cows
will
never
give
large
messes
of
milk
unless
they
are
largely
fed
this
is
entirely
a
mechanical
process
the
agitation
of
the
cream
dashes
the
oily
globules
in
the
cream
against
each
other
and
they
remain
together
and
grow
larger
until
the
butter
is
what
the
dairy
woman
calls
gathered
the
butter
in
the
milk
when
drawn
from
the
cow
is
the
same
as
when
on
the
table
only
it
is
in
the
milk
in
the
form
of
very
small
globes
churning
brings
them
together
the
object
then
to
be
secured
by
any
form
of
a
churn
is
agitation
or
dashing
and
beating
together
of
the
should
be
from
sixty
to
degrees
perhaps
is
best
this
had
better
always
be
determined
by
a
thermometer
immersed
in
it
many
churns
have
been
invented
and
patented
and
every
new
one
is
of
course
the
best
a
cylinder
is
usually
preferred
as
the
best
form
for
a
churn
and
the
churning
is
performed
by
turning
a
crank
an
oblong
square
box
is
far
better
than
a
cylinder
in
churning
in
a
cylinder
it
may
often
occur
that
the
cream
moves
round
in
a
body
with
the
dasher
and
so
is
but
slightly
agitated
but
change
that
cylinder
into
an
oblong
square
and
the
cream
is
so
dashed
against
the
corners
of
the
box
that
a
most
rapid
agitation
is
the
result
and
the
churning
is
finished
in
a
short
space
of
time
any
person
of
a
little
mechanical
genius
can
construct
a
churn
equal
to
any
in
use
and
at
a
trifling
expense
it
is
well
to
make
a
churn
double
leaving
an
inch
between
the
two
into
which
cold
or
warm
water
can
be
poured
to
regulate
the
temperature
of
the
cream
this
would
be
a
great
saving
of
time
and
patience
in
churning
those
who
use
the
churns
with
dashes
can
most
conveniently
warm
or
cool
their
cream
by
placing
the
churn
containing
it
in
a
tub
of
cold
or
boiling
water
as
the
case
may
require
until
it
comes
to
the
temperature
of
sixty
or
seventy
degrees
to
make
butter
of
extra
quality
for
the
fair
or
for
a
luxury
on
your
own
table
set
only
one
third
of
the
milk
and
that
the
last
drawn
from
the
cow
the
scotch
so
celebrated
for
making
butter
of
more
marrowy
richness
than
any
other
first
let
the
calves
draw
half
or
two
thirds
of
the
milk
and
then
take
the
remainder
this
makes
the
finest
butter
in
the
world
depends
upon
the
treatment
immediately
after
churning
success
depends
upon
getting
the
buttermilk
all
out
and
putting
in
all
the
salt
you
put
in
at
all
immediately
say
within
ten
minutes
after
churning
some
accomplish
this
by
washing
and
others
by
working
it
being
much
opposed
to
putting
in
a
drop
of
water
those
who
use
water
in
their
butter
and
those
who
do
not
are
equally
confident
of
the
superiority
of
their
own
method
but
all
good
agree
that
the
less
you
work
butter
and
still
remove
all
the
milk
the
better
it
will
be
and
the
more
you
are
obliged
to
work
it
the
more
gluey
and
therefore
the
poorer
the
quality
very
good
butter
is
made
by
immediately
working
all
the
milk
out
and
salting
thoroughly
working
the
salt
into
every
part
without
the
use
of
water
butter
the
next
day
after
churning
should
be
nothing
more
than
nicely
forming
it
into
rolls
without
any
further
working
or
any
more
salt
an
error
that
spoils
more
butter
than
any
other
is
that
of
doing
very
little
with
butter
when
it
first
comes
out
of
the
churn
because
it
must
be
gone
through
with
the
next
day
many
do
not
know
why
their
butter
has
different
colors
in
the
same
mass
some
white
and
some
quite
yellow
and
all
shades
between
the
reason
always
is
putting
in
the
salt
immediately
on
churning
but
neglecting
to
incorporate
that
salt
into
every
part
of
the
mass
equally
thus
where
there
is
most
salt
there
will
be
one
color
and
where
less
another
another
evil
is
when
the
salt
is
thus
put
in
carelessly
while
much
buttermilk
remains
that
salt
dissolves
and
when
the
butter
is
worked
over
the
next
day
the
salt
is
mostly
worked
out
with
the
milk
or
water
left
in
the
previous
day
the
addition
of
more
salt
then
will
not
save
it
it
has
received
an
injury
by
retaining
the
milk
or
water
for
hours
from
which
no
future
treatment
will
enable
it
to
recover
we
recommend
washing
as
preferable
it
has
the
following
advantages
it
cools
butter
quickly
in
warm
weather
bringing
it
at
once
into
a
situation
to
be
properly
worked
and
salted
the
buttermilk
is
also
removed
more
speedily
than
in
any
other
way
this
is
a
great
object
it
removes
the
milk
with
less
working
and
consequently
with
less
injury
than
the
other
method
these
three
advantages
cooling
in
hot
weather
expelling
the
milk
in
the
shortest
time
and
working
the
butter
the
least
lead
us
to
prefer
using
water
by
one
hundred
per
cent
we
have
for
years
used
butter
that
has
been
made
in
this
way
and
never
tasted
better
butter
made
in
this
way
in
summer
will
keep
well
till
next
summer
to
our
certain
knowledge
immediately
after
churning
pour
off
all
the
milk
and
put
in
half
a
pailful
of
water
more
or
less
according
to
quantity
agitate
the
whole
with
the
dasher
and
pour
off
the
water
repeat
this
once
or
twice
until
the
water
runs
off
clear
without
any
coloring
from
the
milk
and
nearly
all
the
buttermilk
is
out
this
can
all
be
done
in
five
minutes
after
churning
press
out
the
very
little
water
that
will
remain
and
put
in
all
the
salt
the
butter
will
require
and
work
it
thoroughly
into
every
part
all
this
need
occupy
no
more
than
ten
minutes
and
the
butter
is
set
away
for
putting
up
in
rolls
or
packing
down
in
jars
the
next
day
such
butter
would
keep
tied
up
in
a
bag
and
hung
in
a
good
airy
place
best
to
put
it
down
in
a
jar
packed
close
put
a
cloth
over
top
and
cover
with
half
an
inch
of
fine
salt
the
only
difficulty
in
keeping
butter
grows
out
of
failure
to
get
out
all
the
milk
and
thoroughly
salt
every
particle
within
fifteen
minutes
after
churning
speedy
removal
of
buttermilk
and
water
and
speedy
salting
will
make
any
butter
keep
this
subject
is
so
important
as
good
butter
is
such
a
luxury
on
every
table
that
we
recapitulate
the
essentials
of
good
butter
making
keep
everything
sweet
and
clean
and
well
dried
in
the
sun
milk
the
cows
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
same
hour
and
draw
the
milk
very
quickly
and
very
clean
set
the
milk
in
pans
three
inches
deep
in
good
air
removed
from
anything
that
might
give
it
an
unpleasant
flavor
and
where
it
will
be
at
a
temperature
of
fifty
to
sixty
degrees
churn
the
cream
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
get
out
the
buttermilk
and
salt
thoroughly
within
fifteen
minutes
after
churning
either
with
water
or
without
as
you
prefer
mix
the
salt
thoroughly
in
every
particle
put
up
in
balls
or
pack
closely
in
jars
the
next
day
remember
to
work
the
butter
as
little
as
possible
in
removing
the
milk
the
more
it
is
worked
the
more
will
it
be
like
salve
or
oil
and
the
poorer
the
quality
hence
it
is
better
to
wash
it
with
cold
water
because
you
can
wash
out
the
buttermilk
with
much
less
working
of
the
butter
to
make
the
best
possible
quality
of
butter
use
only
one
third
of
the
milk
of
the
cows
at
each
milking
and
that
the
last
drawn
in
the
winter
when
cream
does
not
get
sufficiently
sour
put
in
a
little
or
calves
rennet
if
too
white
put
in
a
little
of
the
juice
of

to
give
it
a
yellow
hue
butternut
this
is
a
rich
pleasant
nut
but
contains
rather
too
much
oil
for
health
the
oil
obtained
by
compression
is
fine
for
clocks
the
root
like
the
branches
are
and
hence
injurious
to
the
land
about
them
two
or
three
trees
on
some
corner
not
desired
for
cultivation
or
in
the
street
will
be
sufficient
a
rough
piece
of
ground
not
suitable
for
cultivation
might
be
occupied
by
an
orchard

and
be
profitable
for
market
and
as
a
family
luxury
the
bark
is
often
used
as
a
coloring
substance
cabbage
the
best
catalogues
of
seeds
enumerate
over
twenty
varieties
beside
the
cauliflowers
borecoles
a
few
are
superior
and
should
therefore
be
cultivated
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
early
york
is
best
for
early
use
it
is
earlier
than
any
other
and
with
proper
treatment
nearly
every
plant
will
form
a
small
compact
solid
head
tender
and
of
delicious
flavor
no
garden
is
complete
without
it
early

and
early
sugarloaf
come
next
in
season
to
the
early

producing
much
larger
heads
large
york
is
a
good
variety
maturing
later
than
the
preceding
and
before
the
late
drumheads
large
drumhead
late
drumhead
or
large
flat
dutch
are
the
best
for
winter
and
spring
use
there
are
many
varieties
under
these
names
so
that
cultivators
often
get
disappointed
in
purchasing
seeds
it
is
now
difficult
to
describe
cabbages
intelligibly
every
worthless
hybrid
goes
under
some
excellent
name
a
dutch
cabbage
with
a
short
stem
and
very
small
at
the
ground
is
the
best
with
which
we
are
acquainted
of
this
variety
the
seed
of
which
was
brought
from
germany
we
have
raised
solid
heads
larger
than
a
half
bushel
while
others
called
good
standing
by
their
side
did
not
grow
to
more
than
half
that
size
this
variety
may
be
distinguished
by
the
purple
on
the
top
of
the
grown
head
and
by
the
decided
purple
of
the
young
plants
resembling
the
red
dutch
though
not
of
quite
so
deep
a
color
red
dutch
having
a
very
hard
small
head
deep
purple
throughout
is
the
very
best
for
pickling
every
garden
should
have
a
few
they
are
also
good
for
ordinary
purposes
green
curled
savoy
when
well
grown
is
a
good
variety
the
the
large
scotch
for
feeding
and
others
are
enumerated
and
described
but
are
inferior
to
the
above
it
is
useless
to
endeavor
to
grow
cabbages
on
any
but
the
best
of
soil
plant
corn
on
poor
land
and
it
will
mature
and
yield
a
small
crop
plant
cabbages
on
similar
soil
and
you
will
get
nothing
but
a
few
leaves
for
cattle
therefore
if
your
land
designed
for
cabbages
be
not
already
very
rich
put
a
load
of
on
each
square
rod
cabbages
are
a
very
exhausting
crop
the
soil
should
be
worked
fully
eighteen
inches
deep
and
have
manure
well
mixed
with
the
whole
the
best
preparation
we
ever
made
was
by
not
subsoiling
but
plowing
twice
with
similar
plows
put
on
a
good
coat
of
manure
and
plow
with
two
teams
in
the
same
furrow
one
plow
gauged
so
as
to
turn
a
light
furrow
and
the
other
a
very
deep
one
throwing
it
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
first
when
the
first
plow
comes
round
it
will
throw
the
light
furrow
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
one
this
repeated
over
the
whole
plot
will
stir
the
soil
sixteen
or
eighteen
inches
deep
and
put
from
four
to
six
inches
of
the
top
manure
and
all
in
the
bottom
under
the
other
we
have
done
this
admirably
with
one
plow
changing
the
gauge
of
the
clevis
every
time
round
and
going
twice
in
a
furrow
this
is
the
best
way
for
those
who
use
but
one
team
in
plowing
it
is
worth
much
more
than
the
additional
time
required
in
plowing
enrich
the
surface
a
little
with
fine
manure
and
you
have
land
in
the
best
possible
condition
for
cabbages
this
is
a
fine
preparation
for
onions
and
other
garden
vegetables
and
for
all
kinds
of
berries
subsoiling
is
good
but
is
better
in
all
cases
where
you
can
afford
to
enrich
the
surface
after
this
deep
plowing
the
alluvial
soils
of
the
west
need
no
enriching
after
land
so
level
or
having
so
hard
a
subsoil
as
to
allow
water
to
stand
on
it
in
a
wet
season
is
not
good
for
cabbages
they
also
suffer
more
than
most
crops
from
drought
one
of
the
most
important
offices
of
plenty
of
manure
is
its
control
of
the
moisture
land
well
manured
does
not
so
soon
feel
the
effects
of
drought
one
of
the
best
means
of
preserving
moisture
about
the
roots
of
cabbages
is
to
put
a
little
manure
in
the
bottom
of
the
holes
when
transplanting
put
it
six
inches
below
the
surface
manure
from
a
spent
hotbed
is
excellent
for
this
purpose
it
is
in
the
best
condition
about
the
time
for
transplanting
cabbages
it
is
then
very
wet
and
has
a
wonderful
power
of
retaining
the
moisture
manure
from
the
containing
is
very
good
if
the
manure
be
too
dry
pour
in
water
and
cover
immediately
set
the
plant
in
the
soil
over
the
manure
the
roots
extending
down
into
it
with
a
little
fine
mould
mixed
in
it
and
it
will
retain
moisture
through
a
severe
drought
no
further
watering
will
be
necessary
and
not
one
out
of
of
all
your
plants
will
fail
to
make
a
good
head
in
climates
subject
to
drought
in
summer
cabbages
should
be
set
out
earlier
they
require
more
time
in
dry
weather
than
in
wet
should
they
incline
to
crack
open
from
too
rapid
growth
raise
them
a
little
and
push
them
down
again
this
will
break
some
roots
and
so
loosen
the
remainder
that
the
growth
will
be
checked
and
the
heads
saved
winter
cabbages
should
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
ground
as
long
as
possible
without
danger
of
freezing
in
the
question
of
transplanting
and
of
sowing
the
seed
in
the
places
where
they
are
designed
to
head
has
been
much
controverted
we
have
succeeded
well
in
both
ways
but
prefer
transplanting
it
gives
opportunity
to
stir
the
ground
deep
and
keep
down
weeds
and
thus
preserve
moisture
until
summer
when
it
is
time
to
transplant
it
also
makes
shorter
smaller
and
straighter
stems
which
is
favorable
to
a
larger
growth
of
heads
sow
seed
on
poor
land
the
plants
will
be
straighter
more
hardy
and
less
affected
by
insects
seed
for
early
spring
cabbages
should
be
sown
on
poor
soil
in
september
or
october
if
inclined
to
get
too
forward
transplant
once
or
twice
late
in
fall
set
them
close
together
lay
poles
in
forks
of
limbs
put
down
for
the
purpose
and
cover
with
straw
as
a
protection
from
severe
frost
the
poles
are
to
prevent
the
covering
from
lying
on
the
plants
for
winter
or
spring
use
is
best
done
by
plowing
a
furrow
on
land
where
water
will
not
stand
and
placing
the
heads
in
the
furrow
with
the
roots
up
cover
with
earth
from
three
to
six
inches
deep
letting
the
roots
protrude
the
large
leaves
will
convey
all
the
water
off
from
the
heads
and
they
will
come
out
as
fresh
and
good
as
in
the
fall
if
you
wish
some
more
easily
accessible
for
winter
use
set
them
in
the
cellar
in
a
small
trench
in
which
a
little
water
should
be
kept
and
they
will
not
only
be
preserved
fresh
but
will
grow
all
winter
if
the
cellar
be
free
from
frost
they
are
also
well
preserved
put
in
trenches
eighteen
inches
deep
out
door
with
a
little
good
soil
in
the
bottom
and
protected
with
poles
and
straw
as
directed
for
winter
plants
cabbages
that
have
scarcely
any
heads
in
the
fall
so
treated
will
grow
all
winter
and
come
out
good
tender
fresh
heads
in
spring
this
is
usually
done
in
wet
weather
if
it
be
so
wet
as
to
render
the
soil
muddy
by
stirring
it
injures
the
plants
this
may
be
successfully
done
in
dry
weather
not
excessively
hot
have
a
basin
of
water
in
which
dip
the
root
and
shake
it
so
as
to
wash
off
all
the
earth
from
the
that
adheres
to
it
put
the
plant
in
its
place
at
once
and
the
soil
in
which
it
is
to
grow
takes
hold
of
the
roots
readily
and
nearly
every
one
will
live
transplant
with
your
hand
a
transplanting
trowel
a
stick
or
a
dibble
made
of
a
one
foot
long
sharpened
off
abruptly
and
the
eye
left
on
for
a
handle
put
the
plant
in
its
place
thrust
the
dibble
down
at
a
sharp
angle
with
the
plant
and
below
it
and
move
it
up
to
it
the
soil
will
thus
be
pressed
close
around
the
roots
leaving
no
open
space
and
the
plant
will
grow
do
not
leave
the
roots
so
long
that
they
will
be
doubled
up
in
transplanting
better
cut
off
the
ends
large
cabbages
should
be
three
feet
apart
each
way
and
in
perfectly
straight
rows
this
saves
expense
in
cultivating
as
it
can
be
done
with
a
horse
the
usual
objections
of
farmers
to
gardening
on
account
of
the
time
required
to
hoe
and
weed
would
be
remedied
by
planting
in
long
straight
rows
at
suitable
distances
apart
to
allow
the
free
use
of
horse
cultivator
and
plow
in
cultivating
thus
beets
carrots
cabbages
onions
are
almost
as
easily
raised
as
corn
an
easy
method
of
raising
good
cabbages
is
on
greensward
put
on
a
good
dressing
of
manure
plow
once
and
turn
over
handsomely
roll
level
and
harrow
very
mellow
on
the
top
without
disturbing
the
turf
below
make
places
for
planting
seeds
at
the
bottom
of
the
turf
a
little
stirring
of
the
surface
and
destruction
of
the
few
weeds
that
will
grow
will
be
all
the
further
care
necessary
the
roots
will
extend
under
the
sod
in
the
manure
below
it
and
will
there
find
plenty
of
moisture
even
when
the
surface
is
quite
dry
and
will
grow
profusely
nothing
is
more
difficult
in
cabbage
culture
than
raising
pure
seed
nothing
hybridizes
worse
and
in
nothing
else
is
the
effect
worse
it
must
not
be
raised
in
the
same
garden
with
anything
else
of
the
cabbage
or
turnip
kind
they
will
mix
in
the
blossoms
and
the
worse
will
prevail
raise
seeds
only
from
the
best
heads
and
only
one
variety
break
off
all
the
lower
shoots
allowing
only
a
few
of
the
best
to
mature
seeds
raised
from
stumps
from
which
the
head
has
been
removed
for
use
will
incline
the
leaves
to
grow
down
as
we
often
see
instead
of
closing
up
into
heads
calves
the
best
method
of
raising
calves
is
of
much
importance
it
controls
the
value
and
beauty
of
grown
cattle
stint
the
growth
of
a
calf
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
recover
from
it
much
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
breed
of
cattle
and
some
are
very
highly
recommended
it
is
true
that
the
breed
of
stock
has
much
to
do
with
its
excellence
it
is
equally
true
that
the
care
taken
with
calves
and
young
cattle
has
quite
as
much
to
do
with
it
we
can
take
any
common
breed
and
by
great
care
in
raising
have
quite
as
good
cattle
for
market
or
use
as
can
another
who
has
the
best
breed
in
the
world
but
keeps
them
indifferently
but
good
breeds
and
good
keeping
make
splendid
animals
and
will
constantly
improve
them
the
old
adage
anything
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
is
nowhere
more
true
than
in
the
care
of
calves
we
shall
not
pause
to
present
the
various
and
contradictory
methods
of
raising
calves
that
are
presented
in
the
numerous
books
on
the
subject
that
have
come
under
our
observation
various
preparations
of
oatmeal
and
every
variety
of
ground
feed
sometimes
mixed
up
with
gin
or
some
kind
of
cheap
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
calves
quiet
are
recommended
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
these
would
be
of
no
practical
benefit
to
our
readers
the
following
brief
directions
are
sufficient
seldom
raise
late
calves
their
place
is
in
the
butcher
shop
after
they
are
five
weeks
old
raise
only
those
calves
that
are
well
formed
straight
back
small
neck
not
very
tall
and
a
good
expression
of
countenance
are
the
best
marks
let
every
calf
suck
its
dam
two
days
it
is
for
the
health
of
the
calf
and
the
good
of
the
cow
to
fatten
a
calf
let
it
suck
one
half
the
milk
for
two
weeks
three
fourths
the
third
and
the
whole
the
fourth
continue
it
another
week
and
the
veal
will
be
better
but
we
think
it
preferable
to
take
calves
off
from
the
cow
after
two
days
feed
them
the
milk
warm
from
the
cow
and
give
them
some
warm
food
at
noon
feed
three
times
a
day
they
will
fatten
faster
it
also
gives
opportunity
to
put
oatmeal
in
their
food
after
the
second
week
which
will
improve
the
veal
and
give
you
a
little
milk
if
you
desire
it
our
first
method
is
easier
and
our
last
better
for
fattening
calves
to
raise
calves
for
stock
take
them
from
the
cows
after
the
second
day
feed
them
half
the
milk
if
the
cow
gives
a
reasonable
quantity
for
the
first
two
weeks
begin
then
to
put
in
a
little
oatmeal
after
two
weeks
more
give
one
fourth
of
the
milk
and
increase
the
quantity
of
meal
when
the
calf
is
eight
or
ten
weeks
old
feed
it
only
on
meal
and
such
skimmed
milk
sour
milk
or
buttermilk
as
you
may
have
to
spare
this
is
the
course
when
the
object
is
to
save
milk
if
not
let
the
calf
have
the
whole
with
such
addition
of
meal
as
you
think
desirable
the
easiest
way
to
raise
calves
when
you
do
not
desire
the
milk
for
the
family
or
dairy
is
to
let
them
run
with
the
cows
and
have
all
the
milk
when
they
please
others
let
them
suck
a
part
of
the
milk
and
feed
them
with
meal
besides
this
is
difficult
if
you
milk
your
own
share
first
you
will
leave
much
less
for
the
calf
than
you
suppose
if
he
gets
his
portion
first
he
will
be
sure
to
get
a
part
of
yours
also
this
can
only
be
well
done
by
allowing
the
calf
to
suck
all
the
udders
but
not
clean
the
remainder
being
the
last
of
the
milk
will
make
the
best
of
butter
but
it
is
difficult
to
regulate
it
as
you
please
and
more
difficult
to
feed
a
calf
properly
that
sucks
than
one
that
depends
wholly
upon
what
you
feed
him
hence
it
is
preferable
to
feed
all
your
calves
whether
for
veal
or
stock
a
little
oilcake
pulverized
is
a
valuable
addition
and
the
coarse
flour
of
wheat
are
good
for
calves
but
not
equal
to
oatmeal
good
calves
have
been
raised
on
gruels
made
of
these
meals
without
any
milk
after
the
first
two
weeks
in
winter
feed
chopped
roots
and
meal
mixed
with
plenty
of
hay
and
pure
water
and
always
from
a
month
old
give
salt
twice
a
week
if
calves
are
inclined
to
purge
or
scour
as
the
farmers
call
it
put
a
little
rennet
in
their
food
if
they
are
costive
put
in
a
little
melted
lard
or
some
kind
of
inoffensive
oil
these
will
prove
effectual
remedies
there
is
however
very
little
danger
of
disease
to
calves
well
regularly
and
properly
fed
as
above
fat
calves
are
not
apt
to
have
lice
but
should
such
a
thing
occur
washing
in
is
a
speedy
and
perfect
remedy
during
cold
nights
in
fall
and
all
of
the
first
winter
calves
should
be
shut
up
in
a
warm
dry
place
keep
them
curried
clean
the
cold
and
wet
of
the
first
winter
are
very
injurious
after
they
are
a
year
old
they
will
give
very
little
trouble
the
great
difficulty
with
calves
is
a
want
of
enough
to
eat
they
should
not
only
be
kept
growing
but
fat
all
the
first
year
they
will
then
make
fine
healthy
and
profitable
animals
chalk
or
dry
yellow
loam
placed
within
their
reach
is
very
useful
they
will
eat
of
it
enough
to
correct
the
excessive
acidity
of
their
stomachs
the
operation
of
changing
calves
into
oxen
should
be
performed
before
they
are
twenty
days
old
it
will
then
be
only
slightly
injurious
cans
these
are
much
used
for
preserving
fruits
and
vegetables
there
are
a
number
of
patent
articles
said
to
work
well
they
are
in
our
opinion
more
expensive
and
more
likely
to
fail
in
inexperienced
hands
than
those
that
an
ordinary
tinman
can
readily
make
the
best
invention
for
general
use
is
that
that
is
most
simple
cans
should
be
made
in
cylindrical
form
with
an
orifice
in
the
top
large
enough
to
admit
whatever
you
wish
to
preserve
and
should
contain
about
two
quarts
fill
the
cans
and
solder
on
the
top
leaving
an
opening
as
large
as
a
from
which
steam
may
escape
set
the
cans
in
water
nearly
to
their
tops
and
gradually
increase
the
heat
under
them
until
the
water
begins
to
boil
take
out
the
cans
drop
solder
on
the
opening
and
all
will
be
this
operation
requires
at
least
three
hours
as
the
heating
must
be
moderate
you
may
preserve
in
glass
bottles
filling
and
putting
in
a
cork
very
tight
and
well
tied
and
gradually
heating
as
above
this
will
require
four
hours
as
glass
will
be
in
danger
of
bursting
by
too
rapid
heating
but
for
tomatoes
or
anything
that
you
have
no
objection
to
boiling
and
seasoning
before
preserving
the
best
way
is
to
prepare
and
cook
as
for
the
table
putting
in
only
pepper
and
salt
and
fill
cans
while
the
mass
is
boiling
and
with
a
that
you
can
get
at
any
druggist
laid
around
the
orifice
place
the
cover
upon
it
the
heat
will
melt
the
wax
and
when
it
cools
the
cover
will
be
fastened
and
all
will
be
this
will
require
no
process
of
slow
boiling
set
the
cans
or
bottles
in
a
cool
cellar
and
whatever
they
contain
may
be
taken
out
at
the
end
of
a
year
as
good
as
when
put
in
the
last
method
is
the
best
and
most
simple
of
all
the
whole
principle
of
preserving
is
to
make
the
cans
carrots
these
are
cultivated
for
the
table
and
for
food
for
animals
boiled
and
pickled
or
eaten
with
an
ordinary
boiled
dish
they
are
esteemed
they
are
really
excellent
in
soups
as
a
root
for
animals
they
are
very
valuable
they
are
often
preferred
to
beets
this
is
a
mistake
four
pounds
of
beet
are
equal
to
five
pounds
of
carrot
for
feeding
to
domestic
animals
work
the
soil
for
carrots
very
deep
make
it
very
rich
with
stable
manure
with
a
mixture
of
lime
harrow
fine
and
mellow
and
roll
entirely
smooth
plant
with
a
that
the
rows
may
be
straight
rows
two
feet
apart
will
allow
a
horse
and
small
cultivator
to
pass
between
them
planted
one
foot
apart
and
cultivated
with
a
horse
and
a
cultivator
that
will
take
three
rows
at
once
they
will
yield
much
more
to
the
acre
and
may
be
cultivated
at
a
moderate
expense
exceeding
but
a
little
that
of
ordinary
sow
as
early
as
convenient
as
the
longer
time
they
have
the
larger
will
be
the
product
they
grow
until
hard
frosts
whenever
you
may
sow
them
there
are
several
varieties
but
the
long
orange
is
the
only
one
that
it
is
ever
best
to
grow
it
is
richer
than
the
white
and
yields
as
well
the
earlier
sorts
are
no
better
as
the
carrot
may
be
used
at
any
stage
of
its
growth
they
should
be
kept
in
the
ground
as
long
as
it
is
safe
they
will
stand
hard
frosts
but
if
too
much
frozen
they
are
inclined
to
rot
in
winter
dig
in
fair
weather
dry
in
the
sun
and
keep
dry
it
is
the
best
of
all
root
crops
except
the
beet
all
animals
will
eat
it
freely
while
they
have
to
acquire
a
taste
for
the
beet
cauliflower
the
two
varieties
known
in
this
country
are
the
english
and
the
french
distinguished
also
as
early
and
late
the
french
only
is
suitable
for
cultivation
here
especially
in
the
colder
regions
as
it
is
earlier
this
is
cultivated
in
every
way
like
cabbage
in
several
respects
it
is
preferable
to
cabbage
it
has
a
more
pleasant
flavor
and
is
more
easy
of
digestion
it
is
excellent
for
pickling
seeds
may
be
raised
in
the
same
way
and
with
the
same
precautions
as
cabbage
but
it
is
generally
imported
celery
this
is
one
of
the
finest
of
our
table
vegetables
eaten
raw
with
salt
or
in
soups
sow
seed
early
in
spring
in
open
ground
or
sow
in
hotbeds
if
you
wish
it
very
early
when
the
plants
are
six
inches
high
they
should
be
transplanted
in
trenches
eighteen
inches
deep
containing
six
inches
of
manure
or
compost
this
should
be
well
watered
and
fine
mould
mixed
with
it
and
the
plants
placed
in
it
eight
inches
apart
the
trenches
should
be
from
four
to
six
feet
apart
if
the
weather
be
warm
and
sun
bright
at
the
time
of
transplanting
a
board
laid
lengthwise
over
the
top
of
the
trench
will
afford
perfect
protection
as
the
plants
grow
draw
the
earth
up
to
them
not
allowing
it
to
separate
the
leaves
do
this
two
or
three
times
during
the
season
and
the
stalks
will
be
beautifully
bleached
heavy
loam
is
much
better
than
sand
for
winter
is
best
done
by
taking
up
late
in
the
fall
cutting
the
small
roots
off
and
rounding
down
to
a
point
the
large
root
removing
the
coarse
useless
leaves
and
placing
in
a
trench
at
an
angle
of
degrees
so
that
six
inches
of
the
upper
end
of
the
leaves
will
be
above
the
surface
cover
with
soil
and
place
poles
over
and
cover
with
straw
and
in
a
very
cold
climate
cover
with
earth
keep
out
the
water
the
end
can
be
opened
to
take
it
out
whenever
you
please
and
it
will
be
as
fresh
as
in
the
fall
this
is
better
than
the
methods
of
keeping
in
the
cellar
it
is
more
certain
and
keeps
the
celery
in
perfect
condition
cheese
the
methods
of
differ
materially
in
different
countries
and
in
different
parts
of
the
same
country
it
is
also
so
much
a
matter
of
experience
and
observation
that
we
recommend
to
beginners
to
visit
and
get
instructions
from
practical
makers
but
we
give
the
following
more
general
outlines
leaving
our
readers
to
learn
all
further
details
as
recommended
above
rennet
or
the
calf
stomach
is
used
as
nature
agent
to
turn
the
milk
or
to
curdle
it
without
having
it
sour
there
are
many
fanciful
ways
of
preparing
the
rennet
putting
in
sweet
herbs
but
the
ordinary
plain
method
is
quite
sufficient
which
is
to
steep
it
in
cold
salt
water
the
milk
should
be
set
at
once
on
coming
from
the
cow
setting
it
too
hot
or
cooling
it
with
cold
water
inclines
the
cheese
to
heave
too
much
rennet
gives
it
a
strong
unpleasant
smell
and
taste
break
the
curd
as
fine
as
possible
with
the
hand
or
dish
or
better
with
a
regular
with
three
blades
this
is
especially
important
in
making
large
cheeses
small
ones
need
less
care
in
this
respect
if
the
curd
be
too
soft
scald
it
with
very
hot
whey
or
water
if
it
be
hard
use
a
little
more
than
whey
it
should
stand
a
few
minutes
in
this
whey
and
then
be
separated
and
the
curd
put
into
the
making
it
heaped
full
and
pressed
hard
with
the
hand
spread
a
cloth
over
it
and
turn
it
out
wash
the
hoop
and
put
back
the
cheese
with
the
cloth
between
the
curd
and
the
hoop
and
put
it
in
the
press
after
a
few
hours
take
it
out
wash
the
cloth
and
put
it
again
around
the
cheese
and
return
it
to
the
press
after
seven
or
eight
hours
more
take
it
out
again
pare
off
the
edges
if
they
need
it
and
rub
salt
all
over
it
as
much
as
it
will
take
in
this
is
the
best
way
of
salting
cheese
the
moisture
in
it
at
this
stage
will
cause
it
to
absorb
just
about
as
much
salt
as
will
be
agreeable
return
it
to
the
press
in
the
hoop
without
the
cloth
let
it
stand
in
the
press
over
night
in
the
morning
turn
it
in
the
hoop
and
continue
it
in
the
press
until
the
next
morning
place
it
upon
the
shelf
in
the
and
turn
it
every
day
or
at
least
every
other
day
if
the
weather
be
hot
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
should
be
shut
if
cool
they
should
be
open
to
admit
air
the
richest
is
supposed
to
be
about
that
of
beeswax
this
is
produced
by
annotta
or
otter
rubbed
into
the
milk
at
the
time
of
setting
when
warm
from
the
cow
or
if
the
milk
has
stood
till
cold
after
it
has
been
warmed
cold
milk
must
before
setting
be
warmed
to
about
blood
or
milk
heat
this
coloring
process
has
no
virtue
but
in
its
influence
on
the
looks
of
the
cheese
sage
cheese
is
colored
by
the
juice
of
pounded
put
into
the
fine
curd
before
it
is
put
in
the
hoop
this
is
the
reason
of
its
appearing
in
streaks
as
it
would
not
do
if
put
into
the
milk
like
the
annotta
when
the
cheese
is
ten
days
old
it
should
be
soaked
in
cold
whey
until
the
rind
becomes
soft
and
then
scraped
smooth
with
a
then
rinse
and
wipe
and
dry
it
and
return
it
to
the
and
turn
it
often
until
dry
enough
for
market
rich
cheeses
are
apt
to
spread
in
warm
weather
this
is
prevented
by
sewing
them
in
common
cheap
cotton
exactly
fitting
some
persons
are
very
fond
of
skippery
cheese
but
few
however
like
meat
and
milk
together
especially
if
the
meat
be
alive
hence
to
remove
skippers
from
cheese
into
which
they
have
intruded
is
quite
desirable
the
following
method
is
effectual
wrap
up
the
cheese
in
thin
paper
through
which
moisture
will
readily
strike
dig
a
hole
two
feet
deep
in
pure
earth
and
bury
the
cheese
in
hours
every
skipper
will
be
on
the
outside
brush
them
off
and
keep
the
cheese
from
the
flies
and
you
will
have
no
further
trouble
a
mixture
of
spanish
brown
and
butter
rubbed
on
the
outside
of
a
cheese
frequently
gives
that
yellow
coating
so
often
witnessed
and
exerts
some
influence
in
preserving
it
the
rank
and
putrid
taste
sometimes
observed
in
cheese
may
be
prevented
by
putting
a
spoonful
of
salt
in
the
bottom
of
each
pan
before
straining
the
milk
it
will
also
preserve
the
milk
in
hot
weather
and
give
more
curd
an
english
cheese
called
stilton
cheese
from
the
name
of
the
place
most
celebrated
for
making
it
is
a
superior
article
made
in
the
following
way
put
the
cream
of
the
night
milk
with
the
milk
remove
the
curd
with
the
least
possible
disturbance
and
without
breaking
drain
and
gradually
dry
it
in
a
sieve
compress
it
gradually
until
it
becomes
firm
put
it
in
a
wooden
hop
on
a
board
to
dry
gradually
it
should
be
often
turned
between
binders
top
and
bottom
to
be
tightened
as
the
cheese
grows
smaller
this
makes
the
finest
cheese
known
as
the
size
makes
no
difference
it
can
be
made
by
a
person
having
but
one
cow
to
preserve
cheese
keep
it
from
flies
and
in
a
place
not
so
damp
as
to
cause
mould
of
there
is
a
great
variety
each
maker
will
select
the
one
which
he
considers
best
or
most
convenient
within
his
reach
in
some
places
as
on
the
western
reserve
in
ohio
one
establishment
makes
all
the
cheese
for
the
neighborhood
buying
the
curd
from
all
the
families
around
in
such
places
they
have
their
own
methods
which
they
have
understood
by
all
their
customers
cherry
cherries
are
among
our
first
luxuries
in
the
line
of
fruits
we
have
cultivated
varieties
ripening
in
succession
throughout
the
cherry
season
there
is
no
necessity
for
cultivating
the
common
red
and
very
acid
cherry
except
in
climates
too
vigorous
for
the
more
tender
cultivated
varieties
the
cherry
is
an
ornamental
tree
making
a
beautiful
shade
besides
the
luxury
of
its
fruit
it
is
one
of
the
most
suitable
trees
we
have
for
the
roadside
it
ought
to
be
extensively
planted
by
the
highways
throughout
all
our
rural
districts
as
it
is
in
some
parts
of
europe
in
northern
germany
the
highways
are
avenues
shaded
with
for
distances
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
together
these
trees
have
been
planted
by
direction
of
the
princes
and
afford
shade
and
refreshment
to
the
weary
pedestrian
who
is
always
at
liberty
to
eat
as
much
of
the
fruit
as
he
pleases
this
is
eminently
worthy
of
imitation
in
our
own
country
extremes
of
cold
and
heat
are
not
favorable
to
the
cherry
hence
cool
places
must
be
selected
in
hot
countries
and
warm
locations
in
cold
regions
very
much
however
can
be
done
by
acclimation
it
will
probably
yet
naturalize
the
cherry
throughout
the
continent
a
deep
and
moderately
rich
loam
is
the
best
soil
for
the
cherry
very
rich
soil
causes
too
rapid
growth
which
makes
the
tree
tender
it
will
bear
more
moisture
than
the
grape
or
peach
and
requires
less
than
the
apple
or
pear
it
will
endure
very
dry
situations
tolerably
well
while
in
very
wet
ones
it
will
soon
perish
is
generally
by
budding
small
trees
near
the
ground
the
best
stocks
are
those
raised
from
the
seeds
of
the
common
black
mazzard
it
makes
a
more
thrifty
tree
than
any
other
the
tree
grows
very
large
and
bears
an
abundance
of
medium
black
fruit
smallest
at
the
blossom
end
and
having
seeds
very
large
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
fruit
in
white
gardening
for
the
south
it
is
stated
that
the
common
morello
of
that
region
does
better
by
far
for
seedling
stocks
for
budding
than
the
mazzard
use
then
the
mazzard
for
the
north
and
the
mahaleb
or
common
morello
for
the
south
pick
them
when
ripe
let
them
stand
two
or
three
days
till
the
pulp
decays
enough
to
separate
easily
from
the
seed
by
washing
immediately
plant
the
seeds
in
rows
where
you
wish
them
to
grow
this
is
better
than
keeping
them
over
winter
in
sand
as
a
little
neglect
in
spring
will
spoil
them
they
are
so
tender
when
they
begin
to
germinate
keep
them
clean
of
weeds
the
next
spring
set
them
in
rows
ten
inches
or
a
foot
apart
placing
the
different
sizes
by
themselves
that
large
ones
need
not
overshadow
small
ones
and
prevent
their
growth
in
the
following
august
or
on
the
last
of
july
bud
them
near
the
ground
the
stocks
are
to
be
headed
back
the
following
spring
and
the
bud
will
make
five
or
six
feet
of
growth
the
same
season
the
seldom
needs
pruning
further
than
to
pinch
off
any
little
shoots
that
may
come
out
in
a
wrong
place
and
they
will
be
very
few
and
cut
away
dead
branches
any
removal
of
large
limbs
will
produce
gum
which
is
apt
to
end
in
decay
and
finally
in
the
death
of
the
tree
whatever
pruning
you
must
do
do
it
in
the
hottest
summer
weather
and
the
wounds
will
dry
and
prevent
the
exudation
of
gum
trees
are
generally
trained
horizontally
some
however
are
trained
as
espaliers
against
walls
and
in
fan
shape
when
once
the
form
is
perfected
as
given
under
training
nothing
is
necessary
but
to
cut
off
twice
in
each
season
about
six
weeks
apart
in
the
most
growing
time
all
other
shoots
that
come
out
within
four
inches
of
their
base
new
shoots
will
be
constantly
springing
and
the
tree
will
keep
its
shape
and
bear
excellent
fruit
trees
so
trained
are
usually
in
warm
locations
and
where
they
can
be
easily
protected
in
winter
hence
this
is
adapted
to
the
finer
and
more
tender
varieties
the
varieties

numerous

rapidly

that
a
degree
of

disappointment
the
rich
alluvial
soils
of
the
west
are
regarded
unfavorable
to
the
cherry
we
know
from
observation
and
experience
that
the
common
red
cherry
does
exceedingly
well
there
while
the
best
cultivated
are
apt
to
suffer
much
from
the
winters
one
reason
is
the
common
cherry
is
a
hardy
tree
while
the
cultivated
is
more
thrifty
and
therefore
more
tender
we
give
the
following
as
a
of
raising
the
cultivated
cherries
in
great
perfection
on
all
the
rich
prairies
of
the
west
it
is
all
included
in
dry
locations
and
slight
dry
locations
it
is
known
that
the
rich
alluvial
soils
of
the
west
are
remarkable
for
retaining
water
in
winter
on
level
and
even
high
prairie
land
water
will
stand
in
winter
and
thoroughly
saturate
the
soil
and
freeze
up
this
is
very
destructive
to
the
tender
porous
root
of
the
how
shall
such
locations
be
made
dry
and
these
evils
prevented
by
carting
on
gravel
and
sand
put
two
or
three
loads
of
sand
or
gravel
or
both
in
the
shape
of
a
slight
mound
for
each
there
should
first
be
a
slight
excavation
that
the
sand
and
gravel
may
be
about
half
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
soil
and
half
above
it
this
will
so
elevate
the
tree
that
no
water
can
stand
around
it
and
none
can
stand
in
the
gravel
and
sand
below
it
the
freezing
of
such
soil
will
not
be
injurious
to
the
roots
of
the
tree
is
to
prevent
too
rapid
growth
such
growth
is
always
more
tender
and
susceptible
of
injury
from
sudden
and
severe
freezing
see
puts
back
the
growth
and
throws
the
sap
into
the
lateral
twigs
thus
maturing
the
wood
already
grown
instead
of
producing
new
wood
so
young
and
tender
that
it
will
die
in
winter
and
spread
decay
through
the
whole
tree
with
the
cherry
must
only
be
done
with
small
twigs
cultivators
will
see
at
a
glance
that
this
method
will
certainly
succeed
in
all
the
west
and
southwest
it
is
considered
difficult
to
raise
cherries
at
the
south
the
hot
sun
destroys
the
trees
plant
in
the
coolest
situations
where
there
is
a
little
shade
from
other
trees
though
not
too
near
or
from
buildings
cut
them
back
so
as
to
cause
shoots
near
the
ground
and
then
as
the
peach
so
as
to
keep
the
whole
covered
with
leaves
to
shade
the
trunk
and
large
limbs
and
perfect
success
will
crown
your
efforts
but
in
all
and
of
remove
the
limbs
when
very
small
charcoal
there
are
but
few
who
realize
the
value
of
charcoal
applied
to
the
soil
whoever
will
observe
fields
where
coal
has
been
burned
will
see
that
grass
or
grain
about
the
bed
of
the
former
pits
will
be
earlier
and
much
more
luxuriant
than
in
any
other
portion
of
the
field
this
difference
is
discernible
for
twenty
years
it
is
the
best
known
agent
for
absorbing
any
noxious
matter
in
the
soil
or
in
the
moisture
about
the
roots
of
the
trees
no
should
be
planted
without
a
few
quarts
of
pulverized
charcoal
in
the
soil
this
would
also
prove
highly
beneficial
to
on
land
where
they
might
be
exposed
to
too
much
moisture
its
color
also
renders
it
an
excellent
application
to
the
surface
of
hills
of
vines
it
is
quite
effectual
against
the
ravages
of
insects
and
so
absorbs
the
rays
of
the
sun
as
to
promote
a
rapid
growth
of
the
plants
chestnuts
are
among
our
best
nuts
if
not
allowed
to
get
too
dry
when
dried
hard
they
are
rather
indigestible
the
tree
grows
well
in
most
parts
of
the
united
states
provided
the
soil
be
light
sand
or
dry
gravel
if
the
soil
be
not
suitable
every
man
may
have
a
at
a
trifling
expense
haul
ten
or
fifteen
loads
of
sand
upon
a
square
rod
and
plant
a
tree
in
it
and
it
will
flourish
well
five
or
six
trees
would
afford
the
children
in
a
family
a
great
luxury
annually
the
blossoms
appear
so
very
late
that
they
are
seldom
cut
off
by
the
frost
the
second
growth
is
also
decidedly
ornamental
cider
the
usual
careless
way
of
making
cider
in
which
is
used
all
kinds
of
apples
even
frozen
and
decayed
ones
and
without
any
reference
to
their
ripeness
without
straining
and
neglecting
all
means
of
regulating
the
fermentation
is
too
well
known
this
is
the
more
general
practice
throughout
the
country
but
it
makes
cider
only
fit
for
vinegar
although
it
is
used
for
general
purposes
we
give
the
most
approved
method
of
making
and
keeping
cider
that
is
better
for
invalids
than
any
of
our
adulterated
wines
and
this
is
the
character
of
nearly
all
our
imported
wines
our
domestic
wines
and
bottled
cider
should
take
the
place
of
all
others
select
apples
best
suited
for
cider
and
gather
them
at
the
commencement
of
hard
frosts
let
them
lie
a
few
days
until
they
become
ripe
and
soft
then
throw
out
all
decayed
and
immature
fruit
grind
fine
and
uniform
let
the
pulp
remain
in
the
vat
two
days
it
will
increase
the
saccharine
principle
and
improve
the
color
put
into
the
press
in
dry
straw
and
strain
the
juice
into
clean
casks
place
the
casks
in
an
open
shed
or
cellar
if
it
be
cold
weather
give
plenty
of
air
and
leave
the
bung
out
as
the
froth
works
out
of
the
bung
fill
up
every
day
or
two
with
some
of
the
same
pressing
kept
for
the
purpose
in
three
weeks
or
less
this
rising
will
cease
and
the
bung
should
be
put
in
loose
and
after
three
days
driven
in
tight
leave
a
small
near
the
bung
in
a
cool
cellar
the
fermentation
will
cease
in
two
days
this
is
known
by
the
clearness
of
the
liquor
the
thick
scum
that
rises
and
the
cessation
of
the
escape
of
air
draw
off
the
clear
cider
into
a
clean
cask
if
it
remains
quiet
it
may
stand
till
spring
a
gill
of
fine
charcoal
added
to
a
barrel
will
secure
this
end
and
prevent
fermentation
from
going
too
far
but
if
a
scum
collects
on
the
surface
and
the
fermentation
continues
rack
it
off
again
at
once
then
drive
the
tight
rack
it
off
again
in
early
spring
if
not
perfectly
clear
dissolve
three
quarters
of
an
ounce
of
isinglass
in
cider
and
put
it
in
the
barrel
and
it
will
soon
be
perfectly
fine
bottle
between
this
and
the
last
of
may
fill
the
bottles
within
an
inch
of
the
bottom
of
the
cork
and
allow
them
to
stand
an
hour
then
drive
the
cork
lay
them
in
dry
sand
in
boxes
in
a
cool
cellar
and
the
cider
will
improve
by
age
and
is
better
for
the
sick
than
imported
wines
citrons
are
only
used
for
preserving
their
appearance
and
growth
resemble
in
all
respects
the
watermelon
planted
near
the
latter
they
utterly
ruin
them
making
them
more
citron
than
melon
they
are
injurious
to
most
other
contiguous
vines
they
are
to
be
planted
and
cultivated
like
the
watermelon
are
very
fine
preserved
but
we
think
the
outside
removing
the
rind
of
a
watermelon
better
and
should
not
regret
to
know
that
not
another
citron
was
ever
to
be
raised
clover
the
only
varieties
successfully
cultivated
in
this
country
are
the
red
and
the
white
red
clovers
are
divided
into
large
medium
and
small
the
white
is
all
alike
the
clover
of
hungary
is
an
excellent
productive
variety
enduring
successfully
almost
any
degree
of
drought
but
in
all
the
colder
parts
of
this
country
it
so
badly
as
to
render
it
unprofitable
clover
makes
good
pastures
being
nutritious
and
early
and
rapid
growing
makes
fair
hay
though
inferior
to
timothy
or
white
clover
is
unsuitable
for
hay
it
shrinks
so
much
in
drying
that
it
is
very
unproductive
it
is
the
best
of
all
grasses
for
sheep
pasture
and
its
blossoms
afford
in
abundance
the
best
of
honey
red
clover
plowed
in
even
when
is
an
excellent
fertilizer
it
begins
to
be
regarded
in
western
new
york
as
productive
of
the
weevil
so
destructive
to
wheat
further
observation
is
necessary
to
settle
this
question
hay
is
too
dusty
for
horses
and
too
wasteful
for
cattle
the
stalks
are
so
large
a
proportion
and
so
slightly
nutritious
that
it
is
unprofitable
even
as
it
is
best
to
cultivate
clover
mainly
for
pastures
and
as
a
fertilizer
sowing
clover
and
timothy
together
for
hay
is
much
practised
the
first
year
it
will
be
nearly
all
clover
and
the
second
year
mostly
timothy
but
sown
together
they
are
not
good
for
hay
because
they
do
not
mature
within
ten
or
fifteen
days
of
the
same
time
but
for
those
who
are
determined
to
make
hay
out
of
red
clover
the
following
directions
for
curing
may
be
valuable
mow
when
dry
spread
at
once
and
let
it
wilt
thoroughly
then
put
up
into
small
cocks
not
rolled
but
one
fork
full
upon
another
until
high
enough
it
will
then
shed
water
but
when
rolled
up
water
will
run
down
through
let
it
stand
till
thoroughly
dried
and
then
draw
into
the
barn
it
will
be
bright
and
sweet
another
method
is
to
cut
when
free
from
dew
or
rain
spread
even
and
allow
it
to
wilt
and
the
leaves
and
smaller
parts
to
dry
then
draw
into
the
barn
putting
alternate
loads
of
clover
and
dry
straw
into
the
mow
salting
the
clover
very
lightly
the
clover
is
sometimes
put
in
when
quite
green
and
salted
sufficiently
to
preserve
it
it
is
injurious
to
cattle
by
compelling
them
to
eat
more
salt
than
they
need
cattle
will
eat
but
little
salt
in
winter
when
it
stands
within
their
reach
too
much
salt
in
hay
compels
them
to
eat
more
which
engenders
disease
clover
cured
as
above
makes
the
best
possible
if
great
care
be
used
to
prevent
excessive
salting
saving
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
the
large
red
clover
is
too
late
a
variety
to
produce
seed
on
a
second
crop
the
same
season
as
do
the
medium
and
small
the
first
growth
must
be
allowed
to
ripen
cut
when
the
heads
are
generally
dead
but
before
it
has
begun
to
shell
the
medium
and
small
red
clovers
will
produce
a
good
crop
of
seed
from
second
growth
if
it
be
not
too
dry
immediately
after
mowing
cut
when
the
heads
generally
are
dry
rake
into
small
winrows
at
once
and
soon
put
it
in
small
bunches
and
let
it
stand
until
very
dry
and
then
draw
in
raking
and
stirring
after
it
becomes
dry
will
waste
one
half
of
it
coffee
bean
this
grows
in
a
pod
somewhat
resembling
the
pea
easily
raised
as
other
beans
and
is
very
productive
browned
and
ground
it
is
used
as
a
substitute
for
coffee
by
many
persons
it
is
much
esteemed
if
this
and
the
orange
carrot
were
adopted
extensively
instead
of
coffee
it
would
afford
a
great
relief
to
the
health
as
well
as
the
pockets
of
the
american
people
corn
this
is
the
most
valuable
of
all
american
products
of
the
soil
not
excepting
wheat
or
cotton
it
is
used
for
human
food
all
over
the
world
and
there
is
no
domestic
animal
or
fowl
whose
habits
require
grain
whether
whole
or
ground
that
is
not
fond
of
it
it
is
easily
raised
and
is
a
sure
and
abundant
crop
in
all
latitudes
south
of
degrees
north
the
varieties
are
few
and
principally
local
the
soil
can
not
be
made
too
rich
for
corn
it
should
be
planted
in
rows
each
way
to
allow
cultivating
both
ways
with
a
horse
the
distance
of
rows
apart
has
been
a
subject
of
some
differences
of
opinion
there
is
a
disposition
to
crowd
it
too
near
together
in
western
new
york
where
much
attention
has
been
given
to
it
the
usual
distance
is
three
and
one
half
feet
each
way
others
plant
four
feet
apart
on
all
land
we
have
ever
seen
we
believe
four
feet
apart
each
way
with
four
or
five
stalks
in
a
hill
will
produce
the
largest
yield
it
lets
in
the
sun
sufficiently
around
every
hill
and
the
proportion
of
ears
to
the
stalks
will
be
larger
than
in
any
other
distance
planting
with
a
span
of
horses
and
a
planter
on
which
a
man
can
ride
and
plant
two
rows
at
once
is
the
easiest
and
most
expeditious
we
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
harrowing
corn
as
soon
as
it
comes
out
of
the
ground
it
increases
the
crop
and
saves
much
expense
in
cultivating
all
planters
should
know
that
indian
corn
is
one
of
those
plants
which
will
come
to
maturity
at
a
certain
age
whether
it
be
large
or
small
hence
anything
that
will
increase
the
growth
while
young
will
add
to
the
product
corn
neglected
when
small
receives
thereby
an
injury
from
which
it
will
never
recover
may
help
it
but
never
can
fully
restore
it
if
there
are
small
weeds
the
harrowing
will
destroy
them
and
give
all
the
strength
of
the
soil
to
the
young
corn
if
there
are
no
weeds
the
effect
of
the
harrowing
will
be
to
give
the
young
plants
twice
as
large
a
growth
in
the
first
two
weeks
as
they
would
make
without
it
harrow
with
a
drag
with
the
front
tooth
out
that
the
remaining
teeth
may
go
each
side
of
the
row
use
two
horses
allowing
the
row
to
stand
between
them
let
the
run
as
near
the
corn
as
possible
never
plant
corn
until
the
soil
has
become
warm
enough
to
make
it
come
up
quickly
and
grow
rapidly
if
you
feed
corn
to
cattle
whole
feed
it
with
the
husks
on
as
it
will
compel
them
to
chew
it
better
and
will
thus
be
a
great
saving
crib
corn
only
when
very
dry
and
avoid
the
western
and
southern
method
of
leaving
cribs
uncovered
the
corn
thus
becomes
less
valuable
for
any
use
a
little
plaster
or
applied
to
corn
on
first
coming
up
and
again
when
six
inches
high
will
abundantly
repay
cost
and
labor
it
will
pay
even
on
the
of
the
west
and
is
quite
essential
on
the
poorer
soils
of
the
east
and
north
it
had
better
never
be
neglected
the
crop
will
weigh
more
to
the
acre
by
allowing
it
to
stand
as
it
grew
until
thoroughly
dry
the
next
larger
crop
is
when
the
stalks
are
cut
off
above
the
ear
called
topping
after
it
has
become
glazed
still
a
little
less
will
be
the
product
when
it
is
cut
up
at
the
ground
while
the
leaves
are
yet
quite
green
the
two
latter
methods
are
adapted
for
the
purpose
of
saving
fodder
in
good
condition
for
cattle
intelligent
farmers
regard
the
fodder
of
much
more
value
than
the
decrease
in
the
weight
of
the
grain
corn
thus
cut
up
and
fed
without
husking
is
the
best
possible
way
for
cattle
on
a
large
scale
and
where
corn
is
abundant
to
save
the
whole
swine
should
follow
the
cattle
changing
yards
once
a
week
should
be
gathered
from
the
first
ripe
large
ears
before
frost
and
while
the
general
crop
is
yet
green
select
ears
above
the
average
size
that
are
well
filled
out
to
the
end
and
your
corn
will
improve
from
year
to
year
take
your
seed
indiscriminately
from
the
crib
at
and
your
corn
will
deteriorate
the
largest
and
best
ears
ripen
neither
first
nor
last
hence
select
the
largest
ears
before
all
is
ripe
and
reject
the
small
earliest
ears
soaking
seed
hours
and
then
rolling
in
plaster
before
planting
is
recommended
it
is
conveniently
practised
only
where
you
plant
by
hand
soaking
without
rolling
in
plaster
is
good
if
you
plant
in
a
wet
time
but
if
in
a
dry
time
it
is
absolutely
injurious
once
in
a
while
there
occurs
quite
a
general
failure
of
to
come
up
farmers
say
that
their
corn
looks
as
fair
as
ever
but
does
not
vegetate
well
when
this
is
general
there
is
a
remedy
that
every
farmer
can
successfully
apply
the
difficulty
is
not
as
we
have
often
heard
asserted
from
the
intense
cold
of
the
winter
it
is
sometimes
the
result
of
cold
wet
weather
after
planting
but
we
do
not
believe
that
such
would
be
the
effect
with
good
seed
on
land
the
difficulty
is
the
fall
was
very
wet
and
the
seed
was
allowed
to
stand
out
and
get
thoroughly
soaked
when
it
was
gathered
it
was
damp
and
the
intense
cold
of
winter
destroyed
its
vitality
without
injuring
its
appearance
there
is
no
degree
of
cold
in
a
latitude
where
corn
will
grow
that
will
injure
the
seed
if
it
be
gathered
dry
and
kept
so
our
rules
for
saving
seed
given
above
will
always
remedy
this
evil
this
is
perhaps
the
most
profitable
of
all
green
crops
for
soiling
cattle
sown
on
clean
mellow
land
it
will
produce
an
enormous
weight
of
good
green
fodder
suitable
for
summer
and
early
fall
feeding
of
cows
just
at
a
time
when
dry
weather
has
nearly
destroyed
their
pastures
well
cured
is
better
for
than
the
best
of
hay
cut
fine
and
mixed
with
ground
feed
it
is
excellent
for
cattle
and
horses
it
is
best
preserved
in
small
stacks
or
large
shocks
that
will
perfectly
dry
through
the
tops
and
leaves
removed
while
green
are
very
fine
cotton
no
product
of
the
soil
is
more
useful
than
this
to
this
country
alone
we
give
the
highest
value
to
indian
corn
but
in
usefulness
to
the
whole
world
corn
must
yield
the
palm
to
cotton
it
employs
more
hands
and
capital
in
manufacturing
and
enters
more
largely
into
the
clothing
of
mankind
than
any
other
article
the
history
of
cotton
and
the
and
of
the
manufacture
of
cotton
goods
is
exceedingly
interesting
the
eminence
of
great
britain
as
the
first
commercial
nation
of
the
world
is
due
in
no
small
degree
to
her
cotton
manufactures
and
the
influence
of
this
great
staple
american
product
upon
all
the
interests
of
this
country
social
and
political
civil
and
religious
is
universally
felt
and
acknowledged
the
of
the
south
at
certain
stages
of
growth
and
especially
when
in
bloom
present
scenes
of
beauty
unsurpassed
by
any
other
growing
crop
it
does
not
come
within
our
design
in
this
work
to
give
a
very
extended
view
of
cotton
culture
this
business
in
the
united
states
is
confined
principally
to
a
particular
class
of
men
known
as
planters
they
cultivate
it
on
a
large
scale
having
the
control
of
large
means
such
men
seek
knowledge
of
those
of
their
own
class
and
would
hardly
condescend
to
listen
to
an
essay
on
their
peculiar
business
written
by
a
northern
man
not
experienced
in
planting
and
yet
an
article
not
covering
more
than
ten
pages
of
this
volume
might
be
written
condensing
in
a
clear
manner
all
that
is
established
in
this
branch
of
american
industry
as
found
in
the
publications
of
the
south
such
an
article
well
written
by
a
man
who
would
be
regarded
good
authority
would
be
of
vast
pecuniary
value
to
the
south
whoever
carefully
reads
southern
agricultural
papers
and
turner
manual
will
see
a
great
conflict
of
opinions
on
the
subject
and
yet
a
presentation
of
many
facts
that
one
thoroughly
conversant
with
soil
culture
in
general
would
see
to
be
true
and
important
the
embodiment
of
these
facts
and
principles
in
a
brief
plain
article
that
would
be
received
and
practised
would
add
value
to
the
annual
cotton
crop
that
would
be
counted
by
millions
what
better
service
can
some
southern
gentleman
do
for
his
own
chosen
and
favorite
region
than
to
write
such
an
article
we
give
the
following
brief
view
of
the
whole
subject
not
presuming
to
teach
what
they
are
supposed
to
understand
much
better
than
we
do
but
to
throw
out
some
thoughts
that
may
be
suggestive
of
improvements
that
others
may
mature
and
carry
out
and
to
lead
young
men
just
commencing
the
business
of
planting
to
look
about
and
see
if
they
may
not
make
some
improvements
upon
what
they
behold
around
them
this
will
not
fail
of
being
interesting
to
northern
men
most
of
whom
know
nothing
of
the
or
the
modes
of
its
cultivation
it
is
interesting
too
that
some
of
the
most
essential
points
are
in
perfect
accordance
with
the
great
principles
of
soil
culture
throughout
the
world
there
are
three
species
of
cotton
and
herbaceous
cotton
the
is
cultivated
to
considerable
extent
in
northern
africa
and
produces
a
fair
staple
of
cotton
for
commerce
being
produced
on
trees
from
ten
to
feet
high
it
is
not
so
easily
gathered
the
is
cultivated
in
various
parts
of
the
world
particularly
in
asia
and
south
america
growing
in
the
form
of
small
bushes
it
is
convenient
and
the
staple
is
fair
but
these
are
both
inferior
to
the
herbaceous
cotton
this
is
an
herb
growing
annually
like
corn
a
number
of
feet
in
height
more
or
less
according
to
soil
and
season
and
producing
the
best
known
cotton
under
these
species
there
are
many
varieties
we
need
speak
only
of
the
varieties
of
herbaceous
cotton
writers
vary
in
their
estimates
of
varieties
some
say
there
are
eight
and
others
put
them
as
high
as
one
hundred
this
is
a
question
of
no
practical
moment
the
cotton
called
also
long
staple
on
account
of
its
very
long
silky
fibres
is
the
finest
cotton
known
its
name
arose
from
the
fact
of
its
production
in
greatest
perfection
on
the
low
sandy
islands
near
the
coasts
of
some
of
the
southern
states
it
does
well
on
low
land
near
the
seashore
the
saltness
and
humidity
of
such
locations
seem
peculiarly
favorable
to
its
greatest
perfection
it
yields
about
half
as
much
as
the
short
staple
called
mexican
and
petit
gulf
cotton
and
known
in
commerce
as
upland
cotton
but
the
or
long
staple
sells
for
three
or
four
times
as
much
per
pound
and
hence
is
most
profitable
to
the
planter
in
all
regions
where
it
will
flourish
well
the
mexican
is
very
productive
on
most
soils
and
is
easily
gathered
and
prepared
for
market
there
are
quite
a
number
of
other
varieties
as
banana
pitt
prolific
multibolus
mammoth
the
is
highly
commended
as
are
some
of
the
others
named
they
have
had
quite
a
run
among
most
of
these
varieties
are
the
improved
mexican
it
is
well
to
get
seed
frequently
from
a
distance
but
any
extravagant
prices
are
unwise
improvement
of
is
an
important
part
of
its
most
profitable
culture
while
much
said
about
it
by
interested
parties
is
doubtless
mere
humbug
yet
there
is
great
importance
to
be
attached
to
improvement
of
seed
this
is
true
of
all
agricultural
products
and
no
less
so
of
cotton
than
of
others
two
things
only
are
essential
to
constant
improvement
in
and
select
from
the
best
quality
producing
the
largest
yield
and
maturing
early
pick
it
before
much
rain
has
fallen
on
it
after
ripening
dry
it
thoroughly
before
ginning
and
dry
it
very
thoroughly
after
it
is
clear
of
the
fibre
before
putting
it
in
bulk
without
extra
care
in
drying
has
moisture
enough
to
make
it
heat
in
bulk
by
which
its
germinating
power
is
greatly
impaired
it
is
this
and
the
effects
of
fall
rains
that
causes
seed
to
trouble
planters
so
seriously
by
not
coming
up
this
makes
it
difficult
to
obtain
good
even
stands
and
causes
much
loss
by
diminished
crops
care
in
these
respects
would
add
many
pounds
to
the
acre
in
most
of
the
land
the
soil
for
on
all
land
not
having
a
porous
subsoil
plow
very
deep
it
gives
opportunity
for
the
long
of
the
plant
to
penetrate
deep
and
guard
against
excessive
drought
the
usual
custom
is
to
lay
the
ground
into
beds
elevated
a
little
in
the
middle
and
a
depression
between
them
in
which
excessive
moisture
may
run
off
also
to
increase
the
action
of
the
sun
and
air
the
surface
of
the
soil
to
be
planted
should
be
made
very
fine
and
smooth
this
is
true
of
everything
planted
it
should
be
in
soil
it
comes
up
more
readily
and
evenly
soil
left
in
coarse
lumps
or
particles
gives
the
air
too
much
action
on
the
germinating
seeds
and
young
plants
and
retards
and
stints
their
growth
deep
plowing
guards
alike
against
too
much
or
too
little
moisture
too
much
water
has
room
to
sink
away
from
the
surface
and
allow
it
to
dry
speedily
it
also
forms
a
sort
of
reservoir
to
hold
water
for
use
in
a
drought
the
seed
should
be
planted
in
as
straight
a
line
as
possible
from
three
and
a
half
to
five
and
a
half
feet
apart
one
way
and
from
fourteen
to
inches
the
other
according
to
the
quality
of
the
land
and
the
growth
of
the
variety
planted
rich
lands
will
not
bear
the
plants
so
close
as
the
poor
many
are
great
losers
by
not
securing
plants
enough
on
the
ground
straight
lines
greatly
facilitate
culture
as
it
can
mostly
be
done
with
the
plow
or
cultivator
turning
land
over
deep
just
before
planting
is
the
best
known
remedy
for
the
it
is
said
to
put
them
back
until
the
plants
grow
beyond
their
reach
the
best
planters
generally
cover
with
a
piece
of
plank
drawn
over
the
furrow
in
which
the
seed
is
dropped
it
would
be
far
better
to
roll
it
as
some
few
planters
do
the
effect
on
the
early
vegetation
of
the
seed
and
rapid
growth
of
the
young
plant
would
be
very
great
on
the
general
principles
given
on
rolling
the
object
of
cultivation
is
to
keep
down
the
grass
which
is
the
great
enemy
of
the
cotton
plowing
the
last
thing
before
planting
aids
this
by
giving
the
cotton
quite
as
early
a
start
as
the
weeds
or
grass
cultivate
early
and
the
grass
will
be
easily
covered
and
killed
always
plant
when
it
will
come
up
speedily
and
grow
rapidly
this
is
better
than
very
early
planting
and
certainly
much
better
than
very
late
thin
out
to
one
in
a
place
as
early
as
the
plants
are
out
of
danger
of
dying
gathering
should
commence
as
soon
as
bolls
enough
are
in
right
condition
to
allow
a
hand
to
gather
forty
pounds
per
day
it
is
better
and
cheaper
than
to
risk
the
injury
from
rains
after
the
crop
is
ripe
perhaps
this
is
at
the
present
time
the
greatest
question
for
the
application
of
all
the
most
approved
principles
and
agents
of
fertilization
would
do
more
for
the
interests
of
the
cotton
crop
than
anything
else
are
sometimes
said
to
run
down
so
as
to
render
it
necessary
to
abandon
portions
of
the
land
and
select
new
instead
of
this
land
may
not
only
be
kept
up
with
proper
manuring
but
made
to
yield
larger
crops
from
year
to
year
the
following
analysis
of
the
ash
of
the
will
indicate
the
wants
of
the
soil
in
which
it
grows
potash
lime
magnesia
chloride
phosphoric
acid
sulphuric
acid
silica
this
analysis
shows
that
the
soil
for
cotton
needs
much
lime
bones
or
and
besides
the
ordinary
and
compost
manures
all
the
preparations
and
applications
of
manures
specified
in
this
work
under
the
head
of
manures
are
applicable
to
cotton
the
usual
recommendations
of
rotation
in
crops
is
perhaps
more
important
in
cotton
culture
than
anywhere
else
judicious
fallowing
on
principles
adapted
to
a
southern
climate
is
another
great
means
of
keeping
up
and
improving
the
land
this
is
also
the
only
effectual
means
of
guarding
against
the
numerous
enemies
and
diseases
of
the
the
health
of
the
plants
is
secured
and
they
are
made
to
outstrip
their
enemies
only
by
the
fertility
and
fine
tilth
of
the
soil
in
which
they
grow
this
is
confirmed
on
every
hand
by
the
correspondence
of
the
most
intelligent
planters
of
the
south
let
go
into
a
thorough
system
of
fertilization
of
their
soils
and
attend
personally
to
the
improvement
of
their
by
selection
as
recommended
above
and
the
result
will
be
an
addition
of
one
eighth
or
one
fourth
to
the
products
of
cotton
in
the
united
states
without
adding
another
acre
to
the
area
under
cultivation
when
this
comes
to
be
understood
men
of
small
means
will
cultivate
a
little
cotton
by
their
own
individual
labor
as
the
poorer
men
do
corn
and
other
agricultural
products
and
thus
improve
their
condition
the
above
suggestions
are
the
conclusions
to
which
we
come
from
a
thorough
examination
of
what
has
been
published
to
the
world
on
this
subject
we
recommend
the
careful
perusal
of
the
manual
by
turner
published
by
saxton
and
new
york
and
increased
attention
to
the
subject
by
the
intelligent
educated
and
practical
men
with
whom
the
regions
abound
cows
the
cow
occupies
the
first
place
among
domestic
animals
in
value
to
the
american
people
not
excepting
even
the
horse
from
the
original
stock
still
kept
as
a
curiosity
on
the
grounds
of
some
english
noblemen
cattle
have
been
greatly
improved
by
care
in
breeding
and
feeding
those
wild
animals
are
still
beautiful
but
only
about
one
third
of
the
weight
of
the
ordinary
improved
cattle
and
not
more
than
one
fourth
that
of
the
improving
the
breed
of
cattle
is
a
subject
by
itself
demanding
a
separate
treatise
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
we
should
go
into
it
at
length
in
a
work
like
this
but
so
much
depends
upon
the
cow
that
we
can
hardly
write
an
article
on
her
without
giving
those
general
principles
that
lie
at
the
foundation
of
all
improvement
in
cattle
the
few
suggestions
that
follow
if
heeded
would
be
worth
many
times
the
value
of
this
book
to
any
farmer
not
already
familiar
with
the
facts
the
cow
affects
all
other
stock
in
two
ways
first
the
form
of
calves
and
consequently
of
grown
cattle
is
affected
as
much
by
the
cow
as
by
the
bull
the
quality
and
quantity
of
her
milk
also
has
a
great
influence
upon
the
early
growth
of
all
neat
stock
cattle
are
usually
named
from
their
horns
as
short
horns
it
is
a
means
of
distinction
like
a
name
but
not
expressive
of
quality
the
leading
marks
of
a
good
cow
are
medium
height
for
her
weight
small
neck
straight
and
wide
back
wide
breast
giving
room
for
healthy
action
of
the
lungs
heavy
and
soft
skin
with
fine
hair
skin
yellowish
with
much
dandruff
above
the
bag
behind
a
smart
countenance
is
also
expressive
of
good
qualities
there
is
as
much
difference
in
the
eyes
and
expression
of
cattle
as
of
men
select
only
such
cows
to
raise
stock
from
and
allow
them
to
go
to
no
bull
that
has
not
good
marks
and
is
not
of
a
superior
form
another
important
matter
is
to
avoid
breeding
in
and
in
this
is
injurious
in
all
domestic
animals
and
fowls
always
have
the
cow
and
the
bull
from
different
regions
attention
to
this
would
constantly
improve
any
breed
we
have
and
by
improving
the
size
of
cattle
and
milking
qualities
of
cows
would
add
vast
amounts
to
the
wealth
of
farmers
without
the
necessity
of
purchasing
at
a
great
price
any
of
the
cattle
we
have
observed
in
our
article
on
calves
that
abundant
feeding
during
the
first
year
has
much
to
do
with
the
excellence
of
stock
unite
with
these
regularity
in
feeding
watering
and
salting
keeping
dry
and
warm
in
stormy
cold
weather
and
well
curried
and
clean
and
a
farmer
stock
will
be
much
more
profitable
to
him
but
this
brief
mention
of
the
general
principles
must
suffice
while
we
give
all
the
further
space
we
can
occupy
with
this
article
to
the
infallible
marks
of
the
milking
qualities
of
m
francis
guenon
of
france
has
published
a
treatise
in
which
he
shows
by
external
marks
alone
the
quality
and
quantity
of
milk
of
any
cow
and
the
length
of
time
she
will
continue
to
give
milk
these
marks
are
so
plain
that
they
are
applicable
to
calves
but
a
few
weeks
old
as
well
as
to
cows
whoever
will
take
a
little
pains
to
understand
this
can
know
when
he
proposes
to
buy
a
cow
how
much
milk
she
will
give
with
proper
feed
and
treatment
the
quality
of
her
milk
and
the
length
of
time
she
will
give
milk
after
having
been
gotten
with
calf
if
the
farmer
has
some
of
which
he
proposes
to
send
to
the
butcher
and
others
to
raise
he
may
know
which
will
make
poor
milkers
and
which
good
ones
and
raise
the
good
and
kill
the
poor
thus
he
may
see
a
calf
that
his
neighbor
is
going
to
slaughter
and
from
these
external
marks
he
may
discover
that
it
would
make
one
of
the
best
milking
cows
of
the
neighborhood
it
would
then
pay
to
buy
and
raise
it
though
he
might
have
to
kill
and
throw
away
his
own
which
he
could
see
would
make
a
poor
cow
if
raised
thus
all
extraordinary
milkers
would
be
raised
and
all
poor
ones
be
slaughtered
this
alone
would
improve
the
whole
stock
of
the
country
per
cent
in
as
many
years
attention
has
been
called
to
this
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
by
new
york
a
paper
that
always
takes
a
deep
interest
in
whatever
will
advance
the
great
industrial
interests
of
the
whole
people
and
yet
this
announcement
will
be
new
to
a
vast
number
of
farmers
into
whose
hands
this
volume
will
fall
to
many
it
will
be
utterly
incredible
especially
when
we
inform
them
that
the
indications
are
mainly
the
growth
of
the
hair
on
the
cow
behind
from
the
roots
of
the
teats
upward
impossible
many
a
practical
man
will
say
but
that
same
man
will
acknowledge
that
a
bull
has
a
different
color
different
neck
and

growing
upward
from

destitute

a
very
small
one
is
ever
a
good
milker
every
cow
having
a
scanty
growth
of
coarse
hair
in

mark
will
only
give
poor
watery
milk
and
every
cow
having
a
thick
growth
of
fine
hair
on
the
escutcheon
or
surface
where
it
ascends
and
considerable
dandruff
will
always
give
good
rich
milk
and
be
good
for
butter
and
cheese
every
cow
on
which
this
mark
is
small
will
give
but
little
milk
and
dry
up
soon
after
getting
with
calf
and
is
not
fit
to
be
kept
observe
these
brief
rules
and
milk
your
cows
certain
hours
every
milk
without
stopping
and
not
leaving
a
drop
and
you
never
will
have
a
poor
cow
on
your
farm
and
at
least
per
cent
will
be
added
to
the
value
of
the
ordinary
dairy
that
is
made
up
of
cows
purchased
or
raised
in
the
usual
way
if
your
cows
udders
swell
after
calving
wash
them
in
aconite
made
weak
with
water
it
is
very
good
for
taking
out

common
remedies
are
known

creature
gets
choked
pour
into
the
throat
half
a
pint

by
rubbing
the

curry
your

parts
of
both
hemispheres
in
england
and
on
the
continents
of
europe
and
asia
native
cranberries
are
inferior
in
size
and
quality
to
the
american
our
own
have
also
been
greatly
improved
by
cultivation
they
have
become
an
important
article
of
commerce
and
find
a
ready
sale
at
high
prices
in
all
the
leading
markets
of
the
country
their
successful
cultivation
therefore
deserves
attention
as
really
as
that
of
other
fruits
eastwood
has
written
a
volume
on
the
subject
which
probably
contains
all
the
facts
already
established
together
with
many
opinions
of
scientific
and
practical
cultivators
the
work
is
valuable
but
much
less
so
than
it
would
have
been
had
the
author
put
into
a
few
pages
the
important
facts
and
left
out
all
speculations
and
diversities
of
opinion
the
objection
to
most
of
this
kind
of
literature
is
the
intermixture
of
facts
and
valuable
suggestions
with
so
much
that
is
not
only
useless
but
absolutely
pernicious
by
the
confusion
it
creates
we
think
the
following
directions
for
the
cultivation
of
the
cranberry
are
complete
according
to
our
present
knowledge
it
is
universally
agreed
that
is
the
best
not
from
the
beach
of
the
ocean
barely
but
of
lakes
ponds
or
rivers
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
saline
quality
that
may
be
in
sand
from
the
beach
of
the
sea
is
particularly
useful
it
is
the
cleanness
of
the
sand
on
which
account
it
is
less
calculated
to
promote
a
growth
of
weeds
and
allows
a
free
passage
of
moisture
toward
the
surface
hence
white
sand
is
preferable
and
the
cleaner
the
better
whoever
has
a
moist
meadow
in
the
soil
of
which
there
is
considerable
sand
has
a
good
place
for
a
cranberry
bed
if
you
have
not
a
sand
meadow
select
a
plat
of
ground
as
moist
as
any
you
have
upon
which
water
will
not
stand
unless
you
confine
it
there
and
draw
on
sand
to
the
depth
of
four
or
six
inches
having
first
removed
any
grass
or
that
may
be
in
danger
of
coming
up
as
weeds
to
choke
the
vines
if
you
make
the
ground
mellow
below
and
then
put
on
the
sand
you
will
have
a
bed
that
will
give
you
but
little
further
trouble
peat
soils
will
do
if
you
take
off
the
top
and
expose
to
the
weather
frosts
and
rains
one
year
before
planting
the
first
year
peat
will
dry
and
crack
so
as
to
destroy
young
cranberry
vines
but
after
one
winter
frost
it
becomes
pulverized
and
will
not
again
bake
hence
it
is
next
to
sand
for
a
cranberry
bed
the
shore
of
a
body
of
water
or
of
a
small
pond
is
best
if
it
be
not
too
much
exposed
to
violent
action
of
wind
and
waves
land
that
retains
much
moisture
within
a
foot
of
the
surface
but
which
does
not
become
stagnant
is
very
valuable
the
bottoms
of
small
ponds
that
can
be
drained
off
are
very
good
any
land
that
can
be
flowed
with
water
at
pleasure
is
good
by
flooding
the
blossoms
are
kept
back
till
late
spring
frosts
are
gone
any
upland
can
be
prepared
as
above
but
if
it
be
a
very
dry
soil
it
must
have
a
liberal
supply
of
water
during
dry
weather
or
success
may
not
be
expected
there
are
several
methods
sod
planting
consists
in
preparing
the
land
and
then
cutting
out
square
sods
containing
vines
and
setting
them
at
the
distances
apart
you
desire
this
was
the
general
method
but
it
is
objectionable
on
account
of
the
weeds
that
will
grow
out
of
the
sod
and
choke
the
vines
this
method
is
improved
by
tearing
away
the
sod
leaving
the
roots
naked
and
then
planting
another
method
is
to
cut
off
a
vigorous
shoot
and
plant
the
middle
of
it
with
each
end
protruding
from
the
soil
two
or
three
inches
apart
roots
will
come
out
by
all
the
leaves
that
are
buried
and
promote
the
springing
of
many
new
vines
and
thus
the
early
matting
of
the
bed
which
is
very
desirable
others
take
short
slips
and
thrust
four
or
five
of
them
together
down
into
the
soil
as
they
do
slips
of
currant
bushes
thus
making
a
hill
of
as
many
plants
and
yet
another
method
is
to
cut
up
the
vines
into
pieces
of
two
or
three
inches
in
length
and
broad
cast
them
on
mellow
soil
and
harrow
them
in
as
wheat
others
bury
the
short
pieces
in
drills
in
either
case
they
will
soon
mat
the
whole
ground
if
the
land
be
not
weedy
the
best
plan
for
small
beds
is
probably
the
middle
planting
distances
apart
depend
upon
your
design
in
cultivating
if
your
soil
is
such
that
so
many
weeds
will
grow
as
to
require
cultivating
with
a
horse
or
much
hoeing
four
feet
one
way
and
two
the
other
is
the
best
better
have
land
so
well
covered
with
clean
sand
that
very
few
weeds
will
grow
and
no
cultivation
be
needed
then
set
vines
one
foot
apart
and
very
soon
the
whole
ground
will
be
perfectly
matted
and
will
need
very
little
care
for
years
for
two
or
three
years
pull
out
the
weeds
by
hand
and
the
ground
will
be
covered
and
need
nothing
more
there
are
three
principal
ones
of
the
lowland
species
the
bell
the
bugle
and
the
cherry
cranberries
these
are
named
from
their
shape
probably
the
cherry
is
the
best
being
the
size
shape
and
color
of
the
cultivated
red
cherries
there
has
recently
been
discovered
an
upland
variety
on
the
shores
of
lake
superior
that
bids
fair
to
be
as
hardy
and
productive
as
the
common
currant
on
all
poor
hard
and
even
very
dry
uplands
it
does
remarkably
well
it
grows
extensively
in
the
northern
part
of
the
british
provinces
the
fruit
is
smaller
than
the
other
varieties
but
is
delicious
beautiful
in
color
and
very
abundant
it
will
probably
be
one
of
our
great
and
universal
luxuries
and
unhealthy
by
this
cultivators
denote
those
that
bear
well
and
those
that
do
not
and
yet
the
unhealthy
or
those
that
bear
the
least
are
the
larger
and
varieties
it
is
difficult
to
describe
them
so
that
an
unpractised
eye
would
know
them
from
each
other
the
best
way
to
be
sure
of
getting
the
right
kind
is
to
purchase
of
a
man
you
can
trust
or
visit
the
beds
when
the
fruit
is
in
perfection
and
witness
where
the
crop
is
abundant
mark
it
and
let
it
remain
until
you
are
ready
to
plant
this
is
always
best
done
in
the
spring
or
from
may
to
june
is
performed
by
hand
or
with
a
is
best
for
the
vines
but
is
more
expensive
if
a
rake
be
used
it
will
draw
out
some
small
runners
and
retard
the
growth
of
young
vines
but
it
is
such
a
saving
of
expense
it
had
better
be
used
and
always
drawn
the
same
way
the
fruit
should
be
cleared
of
leaves
and
decayed
berries
and
if
intended
for
a
near
market
be
packed
dry
in
barrels
if
to
be
transported
far
put
them
in
small
casks
say
with
good
water
they
may
thus
be
carried
around
the
globe
in
good
condition
to
keep
well
they
should
not
be
exposed
to
fall
frosts
and
should
not
be
picked
before
ripe
a
little
practice
and
at
first
on
a
small
scale
may
enable
american
cultivators
of
the
soil
generally
to
have
good
cranberry
beds
much
of
the
practical
part
of
this
can
only
be
learned
by
experience
the
above
suggestions
will
save
much
loss
and
discouragement
are
worms
that
attack
the
leaves
and
another
species
that
attack
the
berries
there
are
only
two
remedies
proposed
fire
and
water
if
you
can
flood
your
beds
you
will
destroy
them
if
not
take
a
time
not
very
dry
so
as
to
endanger
burning
the
roots
and
burn
over
your
so
as
to
consume
all
the
vines
next
season
new
vines
will
grow
up
free
from
worms
cucumbers
there
are
quite
a
number
of
varieties
but
a
few
only
deserve
attention
the
best
for
all
uses
is
the
early
cluster
a
great
bearer
of
firm
tender
brittle
fruit
early
frame
long
white
turkey
and
long
green
turkey
are
rather
beautiful
but
not
prolific
varieties
long
prickly
is
very
good
for
pickles
and
fills
a
cask
rapidly
but
is
by
no
means
so
pleasant
as
the
early
cluster
the
short
prickly
and
white
spined
are
considerably
used
the
west
india
or
small
gherkin
is
used
only
for
pickling
and
is
considered
fine
but
we
regard
all
these
inferior
to
the
early
cluster
should
be
made
very
rich
with
compost
and
vegetable
mould
with
a
liberal
application
of
sand
all
vines
do
better
in
a
sandy
soil
plant
in
the
open
air
only
after
the
weather
has
become
quite
warm
an
effort
to
get
early
cucumbers
by
early
planting
is
usually
a
failure
seeds
decay
or
having
come
up
after
a
long
while
they
grow
slowly
and
vines
and
fruit
are
apt
to
be
imperfect
six
feet
apart
each
way
is
the
best
distance
and
after
the
plants
get
out
of
the
way
of
insects
and
become
well
established
two
vines
in
each
hill
is
better
than
more
the
fruit
will
be
better
and
more
abundant
and
they
will
bear
much
longer
than
when
vines
are
left
to
grow
very
thick
they
need
water
in
dry
weather
see
watering
the
first
week
in
july
is
the
best
time
to
plant
for
pickling
in
a
warm
dry
climate
cucumbers
do
better
a
little
shaded
but
not
too
much
planted
among
young
or
in
alternate
rows
with
corn
they
do
well
if
allowed
to
run
up
bushes
like
peas
they
produce
more
and
better
fruit
forcing
for
an
early
crop
is
often
done
by
digging
a
hole
in
the
ground
two
feet
deep
and
two
feet
square
and
filling
with
hot
manure
stamped
down
well
and
covered
with
six
inches
of
fine
mould
put
around
a
frame
and
cover
with
glass
at
an
angle
of
degrees
to
the
sun
plant
one
hundred
seeds
on
the
two
feet
square
when
they
come
up
put
two
plants
in
a
pot
set
in
a
regular
hotbed
and
keep
well
watered
and
aired
until
the
weather
be
warm
enough
to
transplant
in
the
open
air
then
remove
from
the
pots
without
breaking
the
ball
of
earth
and
plant
six
feet
apart
four
plants
left
in
the
original
hill
will
bear
earlier
than
those
that
have
been
removed
to
get
a
large
quantity
of
very
early
ones
plant
a
corresponding
number
of
hills
with
the
two
feet
of
manure
as
above
whenever
the
weather
becomes
hot
they
will
need
to
be
well
watered
or
they
will
dry
up
all
forced
should
have
the
main
runner
cut
off
after
the
second
rough
leaf
appears
this
brings
fruit
earlier
and
twice
as
abundant
on
transplanting
cucumbers
or
any
other
vines
cover
them
wholly
from
the
sun
for
three
days
or
if
the
weather
be
dry
for
a
whole
week
we
once
thought
melons
and
cucumbers
very
difficult
to
transplant
successfully
but
we
ascertained
the
only
difficulty
to
be
the
want
of
sufficient
water
and
shade
when
roots
and
soil
were
so
dry
that
the
dirt
all
fell
off
we
have
transplanted
with
perfect
success
but
for
a
week
the
plants
appeared
to
be
ruined
we
kept
them
covered
and
well
watered
and
they
revived
and
made
a
great
crop
much
earlier
than
seeds
planted
at
the
same
time
protection
of
plants
from
insects
has
been
a
subject
of
much
study
and
many
experiments
ashes
and
lime
and
various
decoctions
and
offensive
mixtures
have
been
recommended
we
discard
them
all
as
both
troublesome
and
ineffectual
our
experience
is
most
decidedly
in
favor
of
fencing
each
hill
of
all
vines
to
keep
off
insects
a
box
a
foot
square
and
fifteen
inches
high
the
lower
edge
set
in
the
soil
will
usually
prove
effectual
put
over
a
pane
of
glass
and
it
will
be
more
sure
and
increase
the
warmth
and
consequently
the
growth
of
the
plants
put
millinet
over
the
boxes
instead
of
glass
and
not
a
hill
will
be
lost
if
a
cutworm
chances
to
be
fenced
in
he
will
show
himself
by
cutting
off
a
plant
search
him
out
and
kill
him
and
all
will
be
safe
such
boxes
well
taken
care
of
will
last
for
ten
years
this
then
is
a
cheap
as
well
as
effectual
method
cucumbers
are
a
cooling
healthy
article
of
diet
used
in
reasonable
quantities
they
should
be
sliced
into
cold
water
taken
out
and
put
in
sharp
vinegar
with
pepper
and
salt
ripe
cucumbers
make
one
of
the
best
of
pickles
for
directions
in
making
we
refer
to
the
if
you
have
room
near
your
back
door
for
one
large
hill
of
cucumbers
you
may
obtain
a
remarkable
growth
dig
down
deep
enough
to
set
in
an
old
barrel
with
head
and
bottom
out
leaving
the
top
even
with
the
surface
fill
with
manure
from
the
stable
well
trod
down
in
fine
rich
mould
around
on
the
outside
of
the
barrel
plant
twenty
or
thirty
put
a
pail
of
water
in
the
barrel
every
day
the
water
comes
up
through
the
soil
to
the
roots
of
the
plants
bringing
with
it
the
stimulus
of
the
manure
and
the
effect
is
wonderful
a
large
barrel
has
been
filled
with
pickles
from
one
such
hill
if
bushes
be
put
up
to
support
the
vines
it
is
still
better
neglect
to
pour
in
water
and
they
will
dry
up
but
continue
to
water
them
and
they
will
bear
till
frost
in
autumn
currants
these
are
among
the
very
best
of
all
the
small
fruits
immensely
productive
in
all
locations
and
adapted
to
a
great
variety
of
uses
and
hang
long
on
the
bushes
after
ripening
there
is
quite
a
number
of
varieties
some
of
which
are
probably
the
mere
result
of
cultivation
of
others
well
known
the
common
red
is
too
well
known
to
need
description
very
acid
and
always
remarkably
productive
in
all
soils
and
situations
the
size
and
quality
of
the
fruit
are
affected
by
location
and
culture
the
native
currants
as
found
in
the
north
of
europe
are
small
and
inferior
but
all
excellent
modern
varieties
have
sprung
from
them
by
cultivation
in
working
these
important
changes
the
dutch
and
french
gardeners
have
been
the
chief
agents
hence
our
names
red
and
white
dutch
currants
the
common
red
and
the
common
white
are
still
cultivated
in
the
great
majority
of
american
gardens
and
yet
they
are
not
worthy
to
be
named
with
the
white
dutch
and
the
red
dutch
which
may
easily
be
obtained
by
every
cultivator
these
two
varieties
are
all
that
ever
need
be
cultivated
long
lists
of
currants
are
described
in
many
of
the
the
result
as
in
all
such
cases
is
confusion
and
loss
to
the
mass
of
growers
we
will
not
even
give
the
list
the
common
red
and
the
white
currants
are
greatly
improved
by
cultivation
but
the
dutch
have
longer
bunches
of
larger
fruit
the
lower
ones
in
the
stem
holding
their
size
much
better
than
common
currants
the
stems
are
usually
full
and
perfect
and
the
fruit
less
acid
and
more
pleasant
a
new
variety
called
the
cherry
currant
on
account
of
its
large
size
is
now
considerably
grown
a
few
bushes
for
variety
and
for
their
beautiful
appearance
may
be
well
enough
but
it
is
not
a
very
good
bearer
and
therefore
is
not
so
profitable
as
the
dutch
the
attractor
is
a
new
french
variety
said
to
be
valuable
early
red
has
the
single
virtue
of
ripening
a
few
days
earlier
than
the
others
the
victoria
is
perhaps
the
latest
of
all
currants
hanging
on
the
bushes
fully
two
weeks
longer
than
others
the
white
grape
the
red
grape
and
the
transparent
are
all
good
and
beautiful
the
utilitarian
will
cultivate
the
red
dutch
and
the
white
dutch
as
his
main
crop
with
two
or
three
of
the
others
for
a
variety
the
amateur
will
get
all
the
varieties
and
amuse
himself
by
comparing
their
qualities
and
trying
his
skill
at
modifying
them
as
these
efforts
have
resulted
in
past
time
in
the
production
of
our
best
varieties
so
they
may
in
future
in
something
far
better
than
we
yet
have
there
is
no
probability
that
any
of
our
fruits
have
reached
the
acme
of
perfection
the
common
black
or
english
black
currant
has
long
been
cultivated
a
jam
made
of
it
is
valuable
for
sore
throat
the
highest
medical
authority
pronounces
black
currant
wine
the
best
in
many
cases
of
sickness
of
any
wine
known
the
black
naples
possesses
the
same
virtues
and
being
a
much
larger
fruit
and
more
productive
should
take
the
place
of
the
english
black
and
exclude
it
from
all
gardens
should
be
set
four
feet
apart
each
way
and
the
whole
ground
thoroughly
mulched
it
keeps
down
all
weeds
and
grass
saving
all
further
labor
in
cultivation
and
greatly
increases
the
size
and
quantity
of
the
fruit
on
nothing
does
mulching
pay
better
see
article
mulching
any
good
is
suitable
for
currants
on
the
north
side
of
a
wall
or
building
or
in
the
shade
of
trees
they
will
be
considerably
later
the
same
effect
may
be
produced
by
covering
bushes
a
part
of
the
time
with
blankets
or
mats
some
are
retarded
by
this
means
so
as
to
be
in
perfection
after
others
are
gone
thus
the
currant
that
naturally
comes
to
perfection
about
midsummer
is
preserved
on
the
bushes
until
october
many
cultivate
currants
in
the
tree
form
allowing
no
sprouts
from
the
roots
and
no
branches
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
ground
this
object
is
secured
by
cutting
from
the
slip
you
are
to
plant
from
which
to
raise
a
bush
all
the
lower
buds
to
within
two
or
three
of
the
top
and
then
pinching
off
at
once
all
shoots
that
may
start
out
of
the
stem
below
this
makes
beautiful
little
shrubs
but
the
top
is
apt
to
be
broken
off
by
the
wind
and
they
must
be
replaced
by
new
ones
every
four
or
five
years
downing
strongly
recommends
it
but
we
can
not
do
so
let
bushes
grow
in
the
natural
way
removing
all
old
decaying
branches
and
all
suckers
that
rise
too
far
from
the
and
keep
the
clusters
of
bushes
and
leaves
thin
enough
to
allow
the
sun
free
access
and
prevent
continued
moisture
in
wet
weather
which
will
rot
the
fruit
and
you
will
find
it
the
cheapest
and
best
we
have
seen
quite
as
large
and
as
fine
fruit
grow
on
such
bushes
that
we
knew
to
be
more
than
twenty
years
old
as
we
ever
saw
of
the
same
variety
when
cultivated
in
the
tree
form
dairy
for
cheese
the
dairy
should
contain
three
rooms
one
for
setting
the
milk
with
suitable
boilers
next
a
in
which
the
cheese
should
be
salted
as
given
under

the
third

in
all
climates
a

be
made
as
tight
as
possible
thick
stone
walls

best
windows
should
be
on
two
sides
north
and
west
but
not
on
opposite
sides
so
as
to
create
a
draught
this
is
no
better
for
cheese
or
butter
and
is
always
dangerous
to
the
operator
let
all
persons
who
would
enjoy
good
health
avoid
a
draught
of
air
as
they
would
an
arrow
if
your
can
be
shaded
on
the
east
south
and
west
by
trees
and
have
only
a
northern
exposure
it
will
aid
you
much
in
guarding
against
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
windows
should
be
fitted
closely
and
covered
with
on
the
outside
so
as
to
exclude
all
flies
a
dairy
for
butter
needs
but
two
rooms
and
a
cool
dry
cellar
with
windows
in
north
and
west
the
first
room
should
be
for
setting
and
skimming
the
milk
and
the
other
for
churning
and
working
the
butter
and
scalding
and
cleaning
the
utensils
if
your
can
be
a

and
a
little
water
passing
over
it
you
will
find
it
a
great
benefit
the
shade
situation
of
windows
avoiding
a
current
should
be
the
same
as
in
the
to
prevent
the
taste
of
turnips
or
other
food
of
cows
in
milk
and
butter
put
one
quart
of
hot
water
into
eight
quarts
of
the
milk
just
drawn
from
the
cow
and
strain
it
at
once
it
has
been
recently
declared
by
intelligent
farmers
that
if
you
feed
the
turnips
to
cows
immediately
after
milking
the
next
milking
twelve
hours
after
feeding
the
roots
will
be
free
from
their
taste
or
odor
the
easiest
remedy
is
the
boiling
water
declension
of
fruits
that
there
are
instances
of
decided
decline
in
the
quality
of
fruits
is
certain
but
on
the
causes
of
those
changes
pomologists
do
not
agree
one
theory
is
that
fruits
like
animals
and
vegetables
of
former
ages
may
decline
and
finally
become
extinct
should
this
theory
be
established
the
declension
would
be
so
gradual
that
a
century
would
make
no
perceptible
change
but
we
do
not
credit
the
theory
even
as
applied
to
former
geological
periods
in
the
history
of
our
globe
the
changes
of
past
ages
as
revealed
in
geology
have
been
brought
about
not
gradually
but
by
great
convulsions
of
nature
such
as
volcanoes
or
the
deluge
that
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
the
old
order
of
things
and
in
a
new
creation
the
true
theory
of
this
declension
of
varieties
of
fruits
is
that
it
is
the
result
of
repeated
budding
upon
unhealthy
stocks
and
of
neglect
and
improper
cultivation
apply
the
specific
manures
that
is
those
particularly
demanded
by
a
given
fruit
prune
properly
mulch
well
and
bud
or
graft
only
on
healthy
seedling
stocks
of
the
same
kind
and
instead
of
declension
we
may
expect
our
best
fruits
to
improve
constantly
in
quality
and
quantity
dill
an
herb
native
in
the
south
of
europe
and
on
the
cape
of
good
hope
it
is
grown
particularly
at
the
south
as
a
medicinal
herb
the
leaves
are
sometimes
used
for
culinary
purposes
but
it
is
principally
cultivated
for
its
sharp
aromatic
seed
used
for
flatulence
and
colic
in
infants
and
put
into
pickled
cucumbers
to
heighten
the
flavor
the
seeds
may
be
sown
early
in
the
spring
or
at
the
time
of
ripening
a
light
soil
is
best
clear
of
weeds
and
thin
in
the
rows
are
the
conditions
of
success
drains
drains
are
of
two
kinds
and
the
latter
are
simply
open
ditches
to
carry
off
that
might
otherwise
stand
long
enough
to
destroy
the
prospective
crop
these
are
frequently
useful
along
at
the
foot
of
hills
when
they
should
be
proportioned
to
the
extent
of
the
surface
above
them
they
are
also
very
useful
on
low
level
properly
constructed
they
will
reclaim
low
swamps
and
make
them
excellent
land
millions
of
acres
of
land
in
the
united
states
as
good
as
any
we
have
are
lying
useless
and
spreading
pestilence
around
that
by
this
simple
method
of
ditching
might
be
turned
to
most
profitable
account
the
direction
of
these
drains
should
be
determined
by
the
shape
of
the
land
to
be
drained
by
them
straight
whenever
they
will
answer
the
purpose
but
crooked
when
they
will
do
better
on
low
and
very
level
land
they
should
be
not
more
than
five
rods
apart
they
should
be
three
times
as
wide
at
the
top
as
they
are
at
the
bottom
and
as
deep
as
the
width
at
the
top
made
so
slanting
the
sides
will
not
fall
in
they
should
be
so
shaped
as
to
allow
only
a
very
gentle
flow
of
the
water
if
it
flows
too
rapidly
it
will
wash
down
the
sides
and
obstruct
the
ditch
and
waste
the
land
excavations
for
are
made
in
the
same
way
only
the
top
need
not
be
so
much
wider
than
the
bottom
it
would
be
a
waste
of
labor
in
excavating
a
useless
quantity
of
earth
there
are
four
methods
of
filling
up
the
ditch
with
brush
with
small
stones
thrown
in
promiscuously
with
a
throat
laid
in
the
bottom
and
filled
with
small
stones
and
with
a
throat
made
of
tile
from
the
pottery
in
all
cases
that
with
which
the
ditch
is
filled
must
not
come
so
near
the
surface
as
to
be
reached
by
the
plow
brush
put
in
green
and
covered
with
straw
or
leaves
will
answer
a
good
purpose
for
several
years
and
may
be
used
where
small
stones
can
not
easily
be
obtained
the
tile
is
more
expensive
than
either
of
the
others
and
not
so
good
as
the
stones
it
is
so
tight
that
the
water
does
not
enter
it
so
readily
and
if
by
any
chance
dirt
gets
into
the
throat
it
obstructs
it
and
there
is
no
other
channel
through
which
the
water
can
pass
off
small
stones
thrown
in
promiscuously
serve
a
good
purpose
for
a
long
time
if
they
be
covered
with
straw
or
cornstalks
before
the
earth
is
put
in
but
the
best
method
is
to
make
a
throat
six
inches
square
in
the
bottom
of
the
drain
laying
the
large
stones
over
the
top
of
it
and
filling
in
the
small
stones
above
and
covering
with
straw
the
water
will
find
its
way
into
the
throat
through
the
numerous
openings
and
if
the
throat
should
ever
be
filled
the
water
could
still
pass
off
between
the
small
stones
above
such
drains
will
last
many
years
and
add
one
half
to
the
products
of
all
wet
springy
land
the
earth
over
the
new
drain
should
be
six
inches
higher
than
the
surface
of
the
field
that
when
well
settled
it
may
be
level
leave
no
places
open
for
to
run
in
that
would
soon
fill
up
and
ruin
a
drain
drains
made
to
carry
off
are
often
useless
by
being
in
a
wrong
location
springs
come
out
near
the
foot
of
rising
ground
just
where
they
come
out
should
be
the
location
of
the
drain
which
would
then
carry
off
the
water
and
prevent
it
from
saturating
and
chilling
the
soil
in
the
field
below
many
persons
locate
their
ditch
down
in
the
centre
of
the
wet
level
below
the
rise
of
ground
this
is
of
no
use
to
the
surface
above
to
the
point
where
the
water
springs
locate
the
drain
just
at
the
point
where
the
land
begins
to
be
unduly
wet
on
very
wet
level
land
a
small
drain
may
also
be
needed
below
the
first
and
main
one
the
cost
of
a
covered
drain
as
described
above
will
be
from
fifty
to
cents
per
rod
and
an
uncovered
one
will
cost
from
twenty
to
thirty
cents
when
you
have
low
swamps
to
drain
you
can
realize
more
than
the
cost
of
draining
by
carting
the
excavations
upon
other
land
or
into
the
barnyard
as
material
for
compost
perhaps
no
expenditure
on
land
needing
it
pays
so
well
as
thorough
draining
it
is
important
for
all
on
low
land
to
put
a
drain
through
under
each
row
of
trees
it
is
indispensable
to
cherries
and
highly
favorable
to
all
other
fruits
ducks
there
are
a
number
of
varieties
the
wild
black
spanish
the
and
the
ordinary
little
duck
of
the
farmyard
are
all
good
the
common
duck
is
the
only
one
we
recommend
for
the
american
a
close
pasture
including
a
rivulet
or
a
small
stream
of
water
affords
facilities
for
raising
ducks
at
a
cheap
rate
from
one
hundred
to
one
thousand
ducks
may
be
raised
in
such
an
enclosure
of
an
acre
or
two
quite
profitably
if
there
is
plenty
of
grass
they
will
still
need
a
little
grain
in
the
winter
the
cheapest
feed
is
beets
or
potatoes
cut
fine
with
a
very
little
grain
each
duck
well
kept
will
lay
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
eggs
larger
than
hen
eggs
and
about
as
good
for
cooking
purposes
they
may
be
picked
as
geese
for
live
feathers
though
not
quite
so
frequently
the
feathers
will
nearly
pay
for
keeping
leaving
the
eggs
and
increase
as
profit
dwarfing
this
has
some
advantages
in
its
application
to
it
will
enable
the
cultivator
to
raise
more
fruit
on
a
small
plat
of
ground
to
get
fruit
much
earlier
than
from
standard
trees
and
sometimes
with
high
cultivation
the
fruit
will
be
larger
dwarfing
is
done
by
grafting
into
small
stocks
almost
all
fruits
have
such
kinds
grafting
into
other
stocks
as
the
pear
into
the
foreign
quince
is
a
very
effectual
method
the
paradise
stock
for
the
apple
the
canada
and
other
stocks
for
the
plum
the
dwarf
wild
cherry
of
europe
and
the
mahaleb
for
cherries
dwarfs
produced
by
grafting
upon
other
stocks
are
compared
with
standards
of
the
same
varieties
they
should
only
be
used
to
economize
room
to
test
varieties
and
produce
fruit
while
standards
are
coming
into
bearing
better
and
much
dwarfs
may
be
produced
by
frequent
transplanting
thorough
trimming
of
the
roots
and
repeated
the
fruit
on
such
dwarfs
must
be
well
thinned
out
when
young
or
it
will
be
smaller
than
is
natural
the
effect
of
heading
in
is
to
cause
the
sap
to
mature
an
abundance
of
this
will
tax
the
tree
too
much
unless
they
be
well
thinned
out
is
an
effectual
method
of
dwarfing
see
pruning
dwarfing
by
repeated
transplanting
and
thorough
will
not
render
the
trees
very
and
in
many
situations
it
is
profitable
the
same
is
true
of
the
dwarf
pear
on
the
quince
all
other
dwarfing
is
more
for
the
amateur
than
the
utilitarian
early
fruits
and
vegetables
are
often
considered
a
great
luxury
and
always
command
a
high
price
early
vegetables
are
secured
by
hotbeds
and
the
various
methods
of
forcing
as
given
under
the
different
species
early
fruits
are
obtained
by
dwarfing
as
given
on
that
subject
location
soil
and
mode
of
cultivation
also
have
much
to
do
with
it
warm
location
soil
often
stirred
and
kept
moist
will
materially
shorten
the
time
of
the
maturity
of
fruits
and
vegetables
seeds
imported
from
the
north
where
seasons
are
shorter
will
mature
earlier
another
means
of
hastening
maturity
is
to
plant
successively
from
year
to
year
the
very
first
that
ripens
this
tends
to
dwarf
in
proportion
as
the
time
of
maturity
is
hastened
in
this
way
such
dwarfs
as
the
little
canada
corn
that
will
mature
at
the
south
in
six
weeks
have
been
produced
various
early
plants
as
tomatoes
cabbages
peppers
and
may
be
started
in
boxes
or
in
the
house
planted
in
february
here
or
in
january
in
the
south
they
will
grow
as
well
as
and
acquire
considerable
size
before
it
is
time
to
place
them
in
the
open
ground
this
is
convenient
for
those
who
have
no
hotbeds
they
must
be
kept
from
frost
and
occasionally
set
out
in
a
warm
day
to
harden
and
they
will
do
well

the

ornamental
the
large

is
one
of
the
greatest
luxuries
of
the
vegetable
garden
plant

at
the
time
of
planting

set
out
in
land
made
very
rich
with
and

feet
and

half
apart
each
way
kept
clean
and
earthed
up
a
little
and
the
bugs
kept
off
while
the
plants
are
small
they
will
produce
an
abundance
of
fruit
there
are
two
varieties
of
the
purple
growing
sometimes
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
the
bearing
smaller
long
fruit
but
a
large
quantity
and
considerably
earlier
than
the
large
many
do
not
like
them
at
first
but
after
tasting
a
few
times
almost
all
persons
become
very
fond
of
them
if
not
properly
cooked
they
are
not
at
all
palatable
although
it
belongs
to
the
yet
to
save
this
excellent
plant
from
condemnation
we
give
a
recipe
for
cooking
it
it
is
fit
for
use
from
one
third
grown
until
the
seeds
begin
to
turn
without
paring
cut
the
fruit
into
slices
one
third
of
an
inch
thick
put
it
in
a
little
water
with
plenty
of
salt
and
let
it
stand
over
night
or
six
hours
at
least
take
it
out
and
fry
very
soft
and
brown
in
butter
or
fresh
lard
if
not
fried
soft
and
brown
it
is
disagreeable
salt
ashes
and
bonedust
or
superphosphate
of
lime
are
the
best
manures
as
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
fruit
is
made

of
the
quality
of
eggs
you
can
always
judge
correctly
by
looking
at
them
toward
the
light
if
they
are
translucent
they
are
good
if
they
look
dark
they
are
old
or
you
may
get

only
paid

many
methods
for
preserving
eggs
are
recommended
packed
away
in
fine
salt
they
will
keep
but
like
salt
meat
have
not
the
same
flavor
as
fresh
set
them
on
their
small
ends
in
a
tight
cask
and
fill
it
with
pure
and
they
will
keep
but
it
changes
their
flavor
this
however
is
a
very
common
method
the
best
way
known
to
us
is
to
pack
fresh
eggs
down
in
indian
meal
allowing
no
two
to
touch
each
other
keep
very
dry
in
a
cool
cellar
and
they
will
remain
for
months
unchanged
elderberry
this

the

among
the

in

it

the
wine
is
so
entirely
superior

that
it

endive
this
is
a
sow
from
july
to
september
according
to
latitude
it
should
come
into
maturity
at
the
time
of
the
first
smart
frosts
to
get
beautiful
white
tender
bunches
they
should
be
tied
up
when
the
leaves
are
about
six
inches
long
when
frost
comes
protect
by
covering
in
very
cold
climates
place
it
in
the
cellar
with
the
roots
in
moist
earth
and
it
will
keep
for
a
long
time
it
will
not
be
extensively
used
in
this
country
for
soups
and
stews
as
it
is
in
europe
and
but
few
of
the
american
people
care
much
about
this

for
those
who
have
and

will
prefer
the
other
finer

there
are
two
varieties
of
endive
cultivated
in
this
country
which
is
the
most
common
and
used
principally
as
a
salad
the
or
batavian
has
thicker
leaves
and
large
heads
and
is
principally
used
in
stews
and
soups
still
another
variety
called
which
is
used
to
some
extent
in
europe
as
a
but
is
cultivated
mainly
for
the
root
it
is
dried
and
ground
to
mix
with
coffee
some
consider
it
quite
as
good
this
is
more
cultivated
at
the
south
than
at
the
north
their
winters
are
much
better
adapted
to
it
the
medicinal
virtues
of
this
plant
are
nearly
equal
to
those
of
the
dandelion
when
it
is
bleached
by
tying
or
earthing
up
the
bitterness
is
removed
and
the
taste
is
pleasant
this
must
be
done
when
the
plants
are
dry
or
they
will
rot
plant
them
in
a

place
and
in

possible
at

and
fatten
better
by
being
fed
almost
but
not
quite
as
much

giving

to
lie
by
them
is
poor
economy
always
let
them
eat
it
all
up
and
desire
a
little
more
at
the
same
time
let
it
be
remembered
that
creatures
kept
very
poorly
for
a
considerable
time
especially
while
young
will
never
fully
recover
from
it
this
is
often
done
under
the
idea
of
keeping
them
cheap
but
it
is
dear
keeping
they
never
can
make
as
fine
animals
afterward
all
grains
and
vegetables
except
beets
and
turnips
are
better
for
being
boiled
or
steamed
the
increased
value
is
much
more
than
the
cost
of
cooking
provided
persons
are
not
so
careless
as
to
allow
food
to
be
injured
by
standing
after
cooking
cooking
is
supposed
to
add
one
fourth
to
the
value
of
food
grinding
dry
grains
adds
nearly
as
much
to
their
value
as
feed
for
animals
as
cooking
if
you
neither
grind
nor
boil
hard
grain
for

it
will
pay
well
to
soak
it
somewhat
soft
before

fences
these
are
matters
of
great
importance
to
the
farmers
of
the
whole
country
but
especially
to
those
on
the
prairies
of
the
west
in
all
localities
where
stone
can
be
obtained
from
the
fields
or
quarry
the
best
and
cheapest
fence
is
a
stone
wall
if
the
stones
are
flat
make
the
wall
two
feet
thick
at
bottom
and
one
at
top
five
feet
high
if
the
stones
are
very
irregular
the
wall
should
be
thicker
stone
walls
should
have
transverse
rows
of
shingles
boards
or
split
sticks
about
half
an
inch
thick
laid
in
the
wall
at
suitable
distances
if
stones
are
quite
flat
three
rows
are
desirable
one
two
the
next
three
and
the
other
four
feet
from
the
ground
if
the
wall
is
made
of
rough
stones
it
will
require
one
more
course
of
sticks
leaving
them
only
a
foot
apart
the
sticks
should
be
of
such
lengths
as
to
come
out
just
even
with
the
wall
on
each
side
the
lower
courses
will
be
longer
than
the
upper
ones
these
sticks
are
to
keep
the
wall
from
falling
down
dig
a
ditch
one
foot
deep
two
feet
from
the
wall
and
throw
the
earth
excavated
up
against
the
wall
and
the
water
will
run
off
and
prevent
heaving
by
frost
and
such
a
wall
will
need
the
merest
trifle
of
attention
during
a
generation
and
will
last
for
centuries
a
cord
of
stones
will
make
one
rod
we
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
this
kind
of
fence
in
all
places
where
stones
can
be
obtained
reasonably
the
pieces
of
wood
laid
in
a
wall
will
keep
well
for
thirty
years
when
they
will
need
replacing
next
to
stone
is
a
good
board
fence
well
made
and
of
good
materials
it
is
durable
and
always
in
its
place
hence
it
is
a
cheap
fence
of
the
various
styles
of
picket
and
other
fancy
fences
for
front
yards
it
is
more
the
province
of
the
architect
or
the
mechanic
to
treat
styles
vary
and
are
constantly
increasing
in
number
the
great
point
to
be
secured
in
all
such
to
render
them
most
durable
is
to
have
the
smallest
possible
points
of
contact
a
picket
fence
with
horizontal
base
should
never
have
the
pickets
standing
on
the
base
board
they
should
be
separated
from
one
quarter
to
one
half
an
inch
a
good
style
for
villages
is
a
cap
water
tight
and
wide
enough
to
cover
the
ends
of
the
posts
and
pickets
with
a
neat
little
cornice
it
looks
well
and
is
very
durable
in
all
localities
where
timber
is
not
too
valuable
a
cheap
and
substantial
fence
is
made
of
split
rails
the
crooked
with
stakes
and
riders
is
well
known
also
that
with
upright
stakes
and
caps
which
is
decidedly
preferable
it
will
stand
much
longer
and
the
stakes
are
out
of
the
way
no
farmer
should
ever
risk
his
crop
with
a
without
stakes
but
the
best
of
all
is
that
made
of
posts
and
rails
the
rails
are
put
in
as
bars
but
so
firmly
that
the
fence
can
not
be
taken
down
without
commencing
at
the
end
where
cedar
or
locust
posts
and
oak
or
cedar
rails
can
be
obtained
a
fence
may
be
made
that
will
not
get
out
of
repair
for
years
no
creature
can
tear
it
down
for
human
hands
can
not
take
it
down
without
tools
or
without
commencing
at
the
end
this
is
considered
expensive
but
as
the
farmer
may
prepare
his
posts
and
rails
in
winter
and
it
will
require
no
attention
to
keep
it
up
and
is
very
durable
and
perfectly
effectual
against
cattle
it
is
an
economical
fence
for
hedges
see
that
article
fennel
this
is
a
hardy
perennial
plant
of
southern
europe
and
belongs
to
both
the
culinary
and
the
medicinal
departments
it
grows
well
on
almost
any
soil
and
is
propagated
by
seeds
offshoots
or
by
parting
the
roots
it
is
much
inclined
to
spread
a
few
roots
kept
within
reasonable
bounds
are
enough
for
a
family
it
is
much
used
in
europe
for
soups

and
garnishes
the
italians
treat
it
as
celery
in
this
country
it
is
mostly
used
medicinally
it
is

very
beneficial

colic
figs
illustration
this
fruit
is
native
in
the
warmer
parts
of
asia
hence
the
cold
winters
of
the
middle
northern
and
western
states
and
of
canada
would
destroy
the
trees
in
the
open
air
without
protection
but
as
the
trees
are
shrubs
they
may
easily
be
protected
either
in
cellars
greenhouses
or
the
open
air
and
uncovered
or
planted
out
in
the
beginning
of
warm
weather
frequent
removals
and
transplantings
injure
the
fig
less
than
any
other
fruit
and
our
summers
are
long
enough
to
produce
large
crops
of
excellent
figs
in
new
england
they
are
raised
in
tubs
set
out
of
the
cellar
in
spring
and
produce
largely
south
of
virginia
the
fig
is
hardy
and
may
be
cultivated
with
profit
in
the
open
air
the
best
method
of
raising
all
kinds
of
fruit
in
climates
where
the
winters
are
too
cold
for
them
is
to
build
a
wall
twelve
feet
high
on
one
side
and
six
feet
on
the
other
with
the
ends
closed
and
cover
it
with
glass
facing
the
south
this
should
only
be
kept
warm
enough
to
prevent
freezing
which
would
require
only
a
small
outlay
men
of
moderate
means
might
thus
have
oranges
lemons
figs
of
their
own
raising
in
all
except
our
coldest
latitudes
such
fruits
might
be
raised
at
a
profit
the
best
is
a
deep
rich
loam
with
a
dry
subsoil

by
layers
and

some

that
they

this
is
true
of

and
hence
our
decision
in
this
work
not
to
attempt
to
describe

with
a

to
their

great
and
regular
bearer
only
when
the

makes
too
strong
a
growth
as
it
is
somewhat
apt
to
do
the
remedy
is
cut
off
on
the

of
november
the
roots
to
half
the
length
of
the
branches
from

and
occasionally

a
little
and
the

and
not

off
the
ripening
of
the
fruit
may
be
hastened
and
perfected
by
putting
a
drop
of
oil
in
the
of
each
fig
this
is
done
by
dipping
the
end
of
a
straw
in
oil
and
then
putting
it
into
the
end
of
the
fruit
this
is
extensively
practised
in

compost
containing
a
pretty
liberal
proportion

is
the
best

for

fish
the
cultivation
of
fish
is
attracting
much
attention
in
this
country
and
in
europe
the
study
and
experiments
of
scientific
and
practical
men
have
established
important
facts
upon
this
subject
fish
may
be
successfully
cultivated
wherever
water
can
be
conveniently
obtained
the
creeks
ponds
and
small
rivers
of
our
land
may
be
well
stocked
with
fish
fish
may
be
raised
as
a
source
of
profit
and
luxury
with
as
much
ease
and
certainty
and
at
a
much
less
expense
than
fowls
this
is
so
important
to
the
whole
people
that
it
demands
the
earnest
attention
of
our
state
authorities
as
it
has
engaged
that
of
the
government
of
france
the
species
of
fish
best
adapted
to
artificial
culture
in
particular
climates
and
in
different
kinds
of
water
have
been
ascertained
a
man
may
know
what
fish
to
put
in
his
waters
as
well
as
what
crops
to
put
on
his
land
or
what
stocks
on
his
farm
the
following
brief
synopsis
of
the
best
methods
of
cultivation
will
be
sufficient
to
insure
success
the
first
requisite
is
suitable
water
for
hatching
eggs
that
have
been
artificially
fecundated
and
for
the
occupancy
of
fish
of
different
ages
and
for
different
species
of
fish
fish
of
different
ages
are
much
inclined
to
destroy
each
other
for
food
and
hence
in
order
to
multiply
them
most
rapidly
they
should
be
kept
in
separate
ponds
until
considerably
grown
when
they
will
take
care
of
themselves
a
spring
sending
forth
a
rivulet
of
clear
water
and
not
subject
to
overflow
in
freshets
is
the
best
location
clear
cool
water
is
essential
to
the
trout
while
some
other
fish
will
do
well
in
warm
and
even
roily
water
the
rivulet
running
from
the
spring
should
be
made
to
form
a
succession
of
ponds
three
or
four
in
number
these
ponds
should
be
connected
with
flumes
made
of
plank
if
the
space
they
must
occupy
be
small
make
the
flumes
zigzag
to
increase
their
length
put
across
those
flumes
once
in
four
or
five
feet
a
piece
of
plank
half
as
high
as
the
sides
of
the
flume
with
a
notch
cut
in
the
centre
of
the
top
that
the
fish
may
easily
pass
over
this
will
afford
a
succession
of
little
falls
in
which
the
trout
very
much
delights
these
different
ponds
are
for
the
occupancy
of
fish
of
different
ages
one
age
only
inhabiting
one
pond
the
flumes
should
have
four
inches
of
fine
and
coarse
gravel
in
the
bottom
making
the
most
perfect
although
you
would
not
wish
the
to
deposite
her
eggs
in
the
natural
way
but
will
extrude
them
by
the
hand
as
hereinafter
directed
yet
they
must
have
these
natural
conveniences
or
they
will
not
incline
to
spawn
at
all
at
the
upper
end
of
each
of
these
flumes
separating
the
ponds
there
should
be
a
gate
of
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
fish
from
one
pond
to
the
other
also
one
at
the
outlet
of
the
lower
pond
to
prevent
egress
of
the
fish
these
must
all
be
so
arranged
that
freshets
will
not
connect
them
all
together
when
trout
are
about
to
spawn
in
their
natural
waters
they
select
a
gravelly
margin
and
remove
from
a
circle
of
about
one
foot
or
two
feet
in
diameter
all
the
sediment
leaving
only
clean
gravel
among
which
they
deposite
their
eggs
where
they
are
hatched
they
want
running
water
of
three
or
four
inches
in
depth
for
this
purpose
a
male
and
female
occupy
each
nest
if
left
to
themselves
they
will
gradually
increase
but
so
many
of
their
eggs
fail
of
being
fecundated
and
so
many
are
destroyed
before
they
hatch
by
enemies
and
by
the
collection
of
sediment
in
the
nest
that
the
number
of
young
fish
is
small
compared
with
the
whole
number
of
eggs
deposited
artificial
spawning
fecundation
and
hatching
are
far
more
productive
the
process
is
simple
and
easy
when
the
first
begins
to
deposite
her
eggs
catch
her
with
a
small
net
it
can
not
be
done
with
bait
for
fish
will
bite
nothing
at
the
time
of
spawning
we
recollect
often
when
a
boy
of
trying
to
catch
trout
out
of
the
brooks
in
october
where
we
could
see
large
beautiful
fish
lying
lazily
in
the
places
from
which
we
had
caught
many
in
the
summer
and
put
our
bait
carefully
on
every
side
of
them
and
they
would
not
bite
then
we
knew
not
the
cause
since
studying
the
habits
of
fish
we
have
learned
that
they
never
will
bite
while
spawning
with
trout
this
is
done
from
the
to
the
of
october
some
few
spawning
till
the
last
of
november
having
caught
two
fish
male
and
female
take
the
female
in
one
hand
and
press
her
abdomen
gently
with
the
other
hand
gradually
moving
it
downward
and
the
eggs
will
be
easily
extruded
and
should
fall
into
an
earthen
vessel
of
pure
water
then
take
the
and
go
through
the
same
process
which
will
press
out
the
spermatic
fluid
which
should
be
allowed
to
fall
into
the
same
vessel
with
the
eggs
stir
up
the
whole
together
and
after
it
has
stood
fifteen
minutes
pour
off
the
water
put
in
more
and
stir
it
up
and
let
it
stand
as
before
this
having
been
done
three
times
the
eggs
will
be
thoroughly
fecundated
and
are
ready
to
be
deposited
in
the
nests
for
hatching
if
the
fish
are
caught
before
the
time
of
beginning
to
spawn
the
eggs
and
the
spermatic
fluid
will
not
be
mature
and
will
be
only
extruded
by
hard
pressing
and
failing
to
be
fecundated
the
eggs
will
perish
the
fluid
from
one
male
will
fecundate
the
eggs
of
half
a
dozen
females
these
eggs
may
be
hatched
in
the
flumes
described
above
though
are
preferable
the
old
fish
can
be
returned
to
the
water
and
may
live
many
years
and
produce
thousands
of
fish
these
fish
carefully
treated
and
fed
will
become
so
tame
as
to
eat
out
of
your
hand
like
the
naiad
queen
of
professors
ackley
and
garlick
of
cleveland
ohio
among
all
the
hatching
apparatus
we
have
seen
described
we
regard
that
of
the
above
professors
at
cleveland
the
best
to
these
gentlemen
the
country
is
much
indebted
for
the
knowledge
derived
from
their
zeal
and
success
in
fish
culture
at
the
head
of
a
spring
they
built
a
house
eight
by
twelve
feet
in
the
end
of
the
house
toward
the
spring
they
made
a
tank
four
feet
wide
eight
feet
long
and
two
feet
deep
this
was
made
of
plank
water
enters
the
tank
through
a
hole
near
the
top
and
escapes
through
a
similar
one
at
the
other
end
and
is
received
into
a
series
of
ten
successive
boxes
each
one
a
little
lower
than
the
preceding
one
these
boxes
were
eighteen
inches
long
eight
inches
wide
and
six
inches
deep
these
were
filled
to
the
depth
of
two
inches
with
clean
sand
and
gravel
the
impregnated
eggs
were
scattered
among
the
gravel
care
being
exercised
not
to
have
them
in
piles
or
masses
clean
water
is
necessary
as
the
sediment
deposited
by
impure
water
is
very
destructive
to
the
eggs
if
it
be
seen
to
be
collecting
it
should
be
removed
by
agitating
the
water
with
a
or
soft
brush
and
allowing
it
to
run
off
continue
this
till
it
runs
clear
but
there
is
a
method
of
preventing
impurities
in
that
will
be
always
effectual
just
around
on
the
upper
side
of
the
spring
make
a
tight
fence
two
feet
high
and
it
will
turn
aside
and
cause
to
run
around
the
spring
all
the
water
that
may
flow
down
the
rise
above
in
time
of
rains
the
house
being
near
the
head
there
will
not
water
enough
get
into
the
spring
in
any
storm
to
roil
the
water
on
the
side
of
the
boxes
where
the
water
escapes
should
be
so
fine
as
not
to
allow
the
eggs
to
pass
through
such
an
apparatus
will
be
perfect
this
great
care
is
only
necessary
for
trout
all
other
fish
worthy
of
cultivation
will
only
need
on
the
margin
of
their
pond
a
convenient
hatching
apparatus
is
a
number
of
fine
enough
not
to
allow
the
eggs
to
pass
through
set
in
a
flume
of
clear
running
water
the
method
of
gehen
and
remy
the
great
of
france
whose
efforts
and
discoveries
have
contributed
more
to
this
science
than
those
of
any
if
not
of
all
other
men
was
to
place
the
eggs
in
of
about
one
foot
in
diameter
having
a
lid
over
them
the
top
and
sides
of
the
boxes
pierced
with
small
holes
smooth
on
the
inside
these
boxes
were
partly
filled
with
clean
sand
and
gravel
and
set
in
clear
running
water
costa
method
at
the
college
of
france
is
to
arrange
boxes
in
the
form
of
steps
the
top
one
being
supplied
with
water
by
a
fountain
and
that
passing
from
one
to
the
other
through
all
the
series
and
the
eggs
placed
on
instead
of
gravel
another
very
simple
method
may
be
arranged
in
the
house
it
is
a
reservoir
a
barrel
or
cask
set
perhaps
two
and
a
half
feet
from
the
floor
and
a
little
hatching
trough
a
few
inches
lower
into
which
water
gradually
runs
through
a
faucet
from
the
reservoir
this
water
running
through
the
escapes
into
a
tub
a
little
below
whatever
plan
be
adopted
great
care
is
necessary
in
preventing
sediment
from
depositing
cleanliness
is
a
principal
condition
of
success
the
eggs
of
the
trout
thus
fecundated
and
deposited
in
october
or
november
will
hatch
in
the
spring
young
trout
need
no
feeding
for
a
month
after
leaving
the
egg
there
is
a
small
bladder
or
vesicle
under
the
fore
part
of
the
body
when
they
first
come
out
from
which
they
derive
their
sustenance
after
this
disappears
or
at
the
end
of
about
a
month
they
should
be
fed
in
very
small
quantities
too
much
will
leave
a
portion
to
decay
on
the
bottom
and
injure
the
water
the
best
possible
food
except
the
is
lean
flesh
of
animals
boiled
and
hashed
fine
for
the
young
fish
the
flesh
of
other
kinds
of
fish
when
they
are
plenty
and
not
very
valuable
would
be
very
good
these
young
fish
should
be
kept
in
the
first
pond
until
a
year
old
then
let
them
into
the
second
pond
closing
the
gate
after
them
to
make
room
for
another
brood
in
the
first
pond
the
next
year
let
them
into
the
third
and
those
into
the
second
that
are
now
in
the
first
and
so
on
till
the
fourth
in
the
last
pond
those
of
different
ages
will
all
be
large
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves
but
sometimes
a
trout
two
years
old
is
said
to
swallow
one
a
year
old
but
when
they
get
to
be
three
or
four
years
old
this
sort
of
cannibalism
ceases
these
principles
can
be
carried
out
in
small
streams
by
constructing
gates
to
keep
sections
separate
and
by
forming
banks
and
waste
ways
for
water
with
wire
gates
so
high
that
the
water
will
not
overflow
in
freshets
and
carry
the
fish
away
in
taking
trout
use
or
the
fly
a
fine
small
line
is
best
they
are
very
shy
the
following
is
a
list
of
other
fish
beside
the
trout
that
are
well
worthy
of
cultivation
when
full
grown
this
fish
is
from
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
in
length
one
of
the
better
fish
for
the
table
and
profitable
to
raise
in
a
pond
covering
not
less
than
half
an
acre
chub
being
a
very
prolific
little
fish
may
be
kept
in
the
same
pond
as
food
for
the
black
bass
and
other
large
fish
they
are
very
fond
of
them
minnows
are
the
best
bait
for
these
fish
though
they
will
bite
a
trolling
hook
of
any
ordinary
kind
you
may
raise
them
as
given
for
the
trout
above
or
allow
them
to
deposite
their
eggs
in
spawn
beds
of
their
own
selection
in
their
pond
they
will
do
well
in
water
less
pure
than
is
demanded
for
the
trout
not
so
large
as
the
black
bass
seldom
weighs
more
than
two
pounds
one
of
the
best
for
food
thrives
well
in
small
ponds
requires
the
same
treatment
as
the
preceding
spawns
in
may
and
hatches
soon
easily
caught
as
he
is
a
great
biter
at
almost
any
bait
bass
or
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
bass
kind
and
as
a
panfish
highly
esteemed
it
prefers
sluggish
water
and
hence
is
well
adapted
to
small
artificial
ponds
spawns
in
may
may
be
treated
as
the
preceding
bites
the
well
and
several
other
kinds
of
bait
a
small
fish
seldom
reaching
a
pound
in
weight
but
is
fine
and
very
easily
raised
in
small
ponds
of
any
kind
of
water
spawns
in
may
and
may
be
treated
in
all
respects
as
the
rest
of
the
bass
family
only
it
will
flourish
well
in
quite
small
ponds
is
one
of
the
best
of
fish
weighs
from
three
to
fifteen
pounds
suitable
only
for
large
ponds
spawns
early
in
the
spring
in
the
marshy
edges
of
sluggish
water
the
eggs
may
be
procured
and
treated
as
the
trout
only
cold
running
water
is
not
necessary
best
caught
by
trolling
it
is
not
a
good
fish
to
raise
with
others
as
it
is
apt
to
eat
them
up
is
everywhere
well
known
as
a
beautiful
little
fish
and
good
for
the
table
at
all
seasons
when
the
water
is
cool
perfectly
hardy
and
adapted
to
sluggish
waters
it
is
one
of
the
best
for
artificial
ponds
treat
like
all
the
preceding
or
allowed
to
take
its
own
course
in
the
pond
it
will
increase
rapidly
rarely
weighs
more
than
half
a
pound
but
is
a
good
this
and
the
grass
bass
and
yellow
perch
may
be
put
together
in
the
same
pond
may
be
cultivated
with
great
success
in
almost
any
water
but
we
are
so
prejudiced
against
them
never
consenting
to
taste
one
that
we
can
not
speak
in
their
favor
of
the
methods
of
introducing
fish
into
our
rivers
and
creeks
from
which
they
have
nearly
all
been
taken
by
the
fishermen
it
is
not
our
design
to
treat
that
subject
may
be
found
fully
presented
in
treatises
on
fish
culture
and
should
command
the
immediate
attention
of
the
authorities
in
all
the
states
we
have
here
given
all
that
is
necessary
to
success
among
the
masses
all
over
the
land
there
is
hardly
a
township
in
the
united
states
or
british
provinces
where
good
might
not
be
constructed
so
as
to
be
a
source
of
profit
and
luxury
to
the
inhabitants
fish
are
so
certainly
and
easily
raised
that
the
practice
of
cultivating
them
should
be
universally
adopted
transporting
fish
alive
is
somewhat
hazardous
especially
if
they
be
of
considerable
size
the
difficulty
is
greatly
lessened
by
keeping
ice
in
the
water
with
the
fish
change
water
twice
a
day
and
keep
ice
in
it
and
you
may
safely
transport
fish
around
the
globe
eggs
of
fish
are
best
transported
in
boxes
six
inches
square
filled
with
alternate
layers
of
sand
and
eggs
scattered
over
when
full
make
quite
wet
and
fasten
on
the
cover
other
methods
are
adopted
which
will
be
easily
learned
of
those
engaged
in
the
trade
flax
change
the
seed
every
season
this
will
greatly
increase
the
quantity
and
improve
the
quality
in
nothing
else
is
it
more
important
in
ireland
the
great
country
of
the
world
they
always
sow
foreign
seed
when
it
can
be
procured
american
seed
is
preferred
and
brings
the
highest
price
experiments
with
different
seeds
on
varieties
of
soils
are
much
needed
changing
from
all
the
soils
and
latitudes
of
our
country
would
be
useful
the
general
rule
however
as
with
all
seeds
is
to
change
from
colder
to
warmer
regions
the
best
are
strong
alluvial
soils
any
soil
good
for
a
garden
is
good
for
flax
as
much
clay
as
will
allow
soil
soon
to
become
dry
and
easily
to
be
made
mellow
is
desirable
black
loam
with
hard
poor
is
also
good
mellow
friable
soils
are
not
more
important
to
any
other
crop
than
to
flax
land
must
not
be
worked
when
too
wet
the
land
should
be
rich
from
a
previous
year
manuring
salt
lime
ashes
and
plaster
are
good
applications
to
flax
after
it
has
come
up
on
light
soil
with
bad
tillage
when
the
flax
was
so
poor
that
the
cultivator
was
about
to
plow
it
up
the
application
of
three
bushels
of
plaster
in
the
morning
when
the
dew
was
on
produced
a
larger
yield
of
better
flax
from
an
acre
than
adjoining
growers
got
from
two
acres
of
their
best
land
flowers
floriculture
is
an
employment
appropriate
to
all
classes
ages
and
conditions
no
yard
connected
with
a
dwelling
is
complete
without
a
the
cultivation
of
flowers
is
eminently
promotive
of
health
refinement
of
manners
and
good
taste
constant
familiarity
with
the
most
exquisite
beauties
of
nature
must
refine
the
feelings
and
produce
gentleness
of
spirit
association
with
flowers
should
be
a
part
of
every
child
education
their
cultivation
is
suitable
for
children
and
young
ladies
in
all
the
walks
of
life
and
bouquets
in
are
injurious
their
influence
on
the
atmosphere
of
the
rooms
is
unhealthy
but
the
cultivation
of
flowers
in
the
garden
or
yard
is
in
every
way
beneficial
we
earnestly
recommend
increased
attention
to
flowers
by
the
whole
american
people
the
necessary
limits
of
our
article
will
allow
us
to
do
but
little
more
than
to
call
attention
to
the
subject
those
who
become
interested
will
seek
information
from
some
of
the
numerous
works
devoted
exclusively
to
ornamental
flowers
flowers
should
be
planted
on
rather
level
land
that
the
rains
may
not
wash
off
the
seeds
and
fine
mould
choose
a
southern
or
eastern
exposure
whenever
practicable
avoid
as
much
as
possible
planting
in
the
shade
should
be
a
deep
rich
mould
neither
too
wet
nor
too
dry
and
should
be
enriched
with
a
little
compost
every
year
the
is
a
most
important
matter
in
cultivating
flowers
many
fail
to
come
up
solely
on
account
of
improper
planting
the
seeds
of
most
flowers
are
very
fine
and
delicate
planted
in
coarse
earth
they
will
not
vegetate
planted
near
the
surface
in
a
dry
time
they
usually
perish
it
is
best
to
cover
all
small
by
sifting
fine
mould
upon
them
and
if
the
weather
does
not
do
it
use
artificial
means
to
keep
the
soil
suitably
moist
until
the
seeds
are
fairly
up
stir
the
soil
gently
often
and
keep
out
all
weeds
it
is
always
best
to
plant
the
seeds
in
rows
or
hills
with
small
stakes
to
indicate
their
location
you
can
then
stir
the
ground
freely
without
destroying
them
flowers
usually
need
more
watering
than
most
other
plants
the
usual
application
of
water
to
the
leaves
by
using
a
sprinkler
is
injurious
it
may
be
better
than
no
watering
at
all
but
is
the
worst
way
to
apply
water
make
a
basin
in
the
soil
near
the
plants
and
fill
it
with
water
the
selection
of
suitable
varieties
for
a
small
is
quite
important
we
shall
only
mention
a
brief
list
those
who
would
make
this
more
of
a
study
are
recommended
to
study
book
of
which
is
quite
as
complete
for
american
cultivators
as
anything
we
have
the
principal
divisions
are
bulbous
flowering
roots
flowering
shrubs
and
flowering
herbs
annual
biennial
and
perennial
the
first
blossoming
and
dying
the
year
they
are
sown
the
second
blossoming
and
dying
the
second
year
without
having
blossomed
the
first
the
last
blossoming
and
the
top
dying
down
and
coming
up
the
next
spring
for
a
series
of
years
flowering
these
need
considerable
sand
in
their
soil
they
should
be
taken
up
after
the
foliage
is
all
dead
and
if
they
are
hardy
put
the
soil
in
good
condition
and
dry
the
bulbs
and
reset
them
and
let
them
remain
through
the
winter
they
may
need
slight
protection
by
spreading
coarse
straw
manure
or
over
them
late
in
the
fall
but
all
the
more
tender
bulbs
do
better
kept
in
sand
until
early
spring
the
best
list
with
which
we
are
acquainted
for
a
small
garden
is
the
following
the
lilies
the
tulips
gladiolas
hyacinths
feraria
tigrida
crocus
narcissus
and
jonquils
the
following
is
a
select
small
list
roses
as
large
a
variety
as
you
please
out
of
the
hundreds
known
flowering
almond
indigo
shrub
wahoo
or
the
althea
snowball
lilac

the

or
venitian

honeysuckle
cherry
the
list
of
beautiful
herbaceous
flowers
is
very
lengthy
we
give
only
a
few
of
those
most
easily
raised
and
most
showy
the
list
is
designed
only
to
aid
the
inquiries
of
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
them
superb

the

fowls
we
are
glad
to
believe
that
hen
that
has
prevailed
so
extensively
during
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
has
considerably
abated
after
all
the
extravagant
notions
about
the
profits
of
hens
shall
have
passed
away
the
truth
will
be
seen
to
be
about
the
following
every
farmer
who
has
considerable
waste
grain
about
and
plenty
more
to
supply
the
deficiency
when
the
fowls
shall
have
gathered
up
all
the
scatterings
had
better
keep
a
hundred
hens
if
he
has
sand
and
gravel
and
and
lime
for
shells
within
their
reach
and
plenty
of
fresh
water
they
will
do
well
without
much
further
care
in
mild
weather
in
cold
weather
in
winter
keep
not
more
than
forty
hens
together
in
a
tight
warm
place
well
ventilated
give
them
their
usual
food
with
burnt
bones
pounded
fine
and
mixed
with
mush
given
warm
with
occasionally
a
little
animal
food
and
boiled
vegetables
and
they
will
lay
more
than
in
summer
they
will
lay
all
winter
without
being
inclined
to
set
every
family
who
will
treat
them
as
above
may
profitably
keep
one
or
two
dozen
through
the
winter
most
persons
who
undertake
with
a
few
acres
of
land
to
keep
fowls
as
a
business
will
lose
by
it
a
few
only
of
the
most
experienced
and
careful
can
make
money
by
it
it
may
be
cheapest
for
some
persons
to
raise
a
few
chickens
for
their
own
use
although
they
cost
them
more
than
the
though
it
would
not
be
best
to
raise
chickens
in
that
way
to
sell
but
some
one
raised
the
chickens
in
market
for
the
and
why
not
i
because
they
raised
a
few
that
got
fat
on
waste
grain
and
you
must
buy
grain
for
yours
and
give
more
for
it
than
you
can
get
for
your
chickens
whoever
would
make
money
by
raising
fowls
on
a
large
scale
must
first
serve
some
kind
of
an
apprenticeship
at
it
as
in
all
other
business
get
this
experience
and
learn
by
experiment
the
cheapest
and
most
profitable
food
and
keep
from
five
hundred
to
a
thousand
fowls
and
a
reasonable
though
not
large
profit
may
be
realized
for
boiled
vegetables
and
beets
cut
very
fine
with
a
little
meal
mixed
in
are
a
good
and
cheap
feed
when
keeping
fowls
in
warm
weather
keep
no
more
than
fifty
together
and
them
on
not
less
than
one
fourth
of
an
acre
of
land
the
expensive
and
artificial
nests
are
mostly
humbugs
have
many
places
of
concealment
about
where
they
can
make
their
nests
as
they
please
when
a
hen
begins
to
set
remove
her
nest
and
all
to
a
yard
to
which
layers
have
no
access
and
you
need
have
no
difficulty
with
her
set
a
hen
near
the
ground
in
a
dry
place
on
fifteen
fresh
eggs
all
put
under
her
at
once
and
they
will
hatch
about
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
twenty
days
old
hens
of
the
common
kind
are
best
to
set
let
them
have
their
own
way
in
everything
but
running
in
the
wet
with
their
young
chickens
and
that
they
will
not
be
much
inclined
to
do
if
they
are
well
fed
much
is
said
about
the
diseases
of
fowls
and
their
remedies
we
have
very
little
confidence
in
any
of
it
sick
chickens
will
die
they
get
time
spent
in
doctoring
them
does
not
generally
pay
wormwood
and
tansy
growing
or
gathered
and
scattered
or
steeped
and
sprinkled
about
the
premises
occupied
by
hens
will
protect
them
from
small
vermin
never
give
them
anything
salt
or
sour
unless
it
be
sour
milk
the
eggs
of
ducks
turkeys
or
geese
may
be
hatched
under
hens
time
thirty
days
hence
if
put
under
with
hens
eggs
they
must
be
set
ten
days
earlier
that
they
may
all
hatch
at
once
fattening
chickens
may
be
well
done
in
six
days
by
feeding
rice
boiled
rather
soft
in
sweet
skimmed
milk
fed
plentifully
three
times
a
day
feed
these
in
pans
well
cleaned
before
each
meal
and
give
only
what
they
will
eat
up
at
once
and
desire
a
very
little
more
put
a
little
pounded
charcoal
within
their
reach
and
a
little
milk
or
clear
water
this
makes
the
most
beautiful
meal
at
a
low
price
never
feed
a
chicken
for
sixteen
or
hours
before
killing
it
or
this
has
been
matter
of
much
speculation
the
result
has
been
what
was
probably
a
main
object
the
sale
of
many
fowls
and
eggs
at
exorbitant
prices
when
chickens
have
sold
at
fifty
dollars
per
pair
and
eggs
at
six
dollars
a
dozen
some
persons
must
have
made
money
while
others
lost
it
yet
there
is
some
choice
in
the
breed
of
hens
the
kind
makes
less
difference
as
far
as
flesh
is
concerned
than
is
usually
imagined
it
requires
about
a
given
quantity
of
grain
to
make
a
certain
amount
of
flesh
large
fowls
give
us
much
larger
weight
of
flesh
than
small
ones
but
they
also
eat
a
much
larger
quantity
of
grain
large
fowls
are
certainly
large
eaters
the
three
best
layers
are
the
black
polands
the
malayas
and
the
shanghaes
by
crossing
with
the
common
fowl
are
better
for
this
country
than
either
of
the
above
pure
fowls
are
generally
improved
by
frequent
crossing
the
best
we
have
ever
had
for
their
flesh
we
produced
by
putting
a
black
poland
rooster
with
common
hens
they
grew
larger
than
either
and
their
flesh
was
very
fine
shanghaes
and
shanghaes
have
proved
permanently
the
best
layers
we
have
ever
had
early
pullets
make
great
fall
and
winter
layers
and
late
chickens
are
great
layers
in
the
spring
when
older
ones
wish
to
set
ducks
we
have
considered
in
a
separate
article
we
shall
do
the
same
with
turkeys
killing
dressing
and
preparing
all
fowls
for
market
will
be
treated
under
the
head
of
poultry
geese
will
also
be
considered
in
another
place
we
should
give
drawings
of
aviaries
but
we
consider
these
generally
worse
than
useless
as
they
are
usually
constructed
an
airy
place
for
summer
and
a
warm
room
for
winter
poles
with
on
for
roosts
and
plenty
of
feed
and
water
sand
gravel
and
lime
will
give
abundant
success
fruit
the
value
of
fruit
is
not
fully
appreciated
in
this
country
as
an
article
of
diet
nothing
is
more
natural
and
healthy
the
creator
gave
this
to
man
for
food
when
human
nature
physically
was
in
its
normal
condition
and
why
meats
have
since
been
allowed
i
know
not
unless
it
be
the
reason
why
moses
allowed
divorce
in
certain
cases
although
it
was
not
so
in
the
beginning
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
why
the
stomach
upon
the
healthy
condition
of
which
all
physical
mental
and
moral
functions
so
materially
depend
should
be
made
the
receptacle
of
dead
animals
and
especially
those
so
long
dead
as
much
of
the
meat
offered
in
market
it
would
puzzle
a
philosopher
to
tell
but
we
will
not
write
an
elaborate
article
on
the
healthfulness
of
a
diet
composed
mainly
of
milk
fruits
and
vegetables
suffice
it
to
say
that
experience
and
observation
as
well
as
analysis
and
physiology
unite
in
demonstrating
that
ripe
fruits
contain
virtues
that
go
far
toward
preventing
the
ordinary
diseases
of
men
they
are
good
plain
or
cooked
and
for
sick
or
well
persons
except
in
extreme
cases
they
regulate
the
bowels
and
control
the
secretions
better
than
any
other
article
of
food
they
are
so
highly
nutritious
that
they
sustain
nature
under
arduous
toil
better
than
either
meat
fine
bread
or
the
irish
potato
with
proper
care
the
fruits
are
cheaper
than
any
other
article
of
food
they
can
be
raised
cheaper
than
corn
or
potatoes
they
may
be
enjoyed
all
the
year
are
profitable
for
market
and
for
food
for
animals
fruitfulness
it
in
often
grow
luxuriantly
but
bear
no
fruit
or
very
little
in
nearly
all
cases
the
evil
may
be
remedied
one
remedy
is
shortening
in
this
is
done
by
cutting
off
half
the
present
year
growth
in
july
this
checks
the
tendency
of
the
sap
to
promote
so
large
a
growth
and
forces
it
to
mature
for
the
next
season
another
effectual
means
is
to
bend
down
all
the
principal
branches
and
tie
them
down
this
has
a
great
influence
in
checking
excessive
growth
and
forming
frequent
transplanting
has
a
tendency
also
to
induce
fruitfulness
root
pruning
is
one
of
best
of
securing
this
object
lay
bare
the
upper
roots
and
cut
off
all
the
larger
ones
two
feet
from
the
tree
this
will
check
excessive
formation
of
wood
and
foliage
render
the
wood
firm
and
the
organic
matter
of
the
sap
will
form
abundance
of
these
methods
will
produce
fruit
in
abundance
on
nineteen
twentieths
of
barren
or
garden
the
garden
has
been
the
most
delightful
abode
of
man
ever
since
his
creation
before
and
since
the
fall
one
of
the
most
pleasant
pastimes
for
ladies
and
children
is
gardening
the
flower
vegetable
and
fruit
departments
are
all
pleasant
and
healthful
of
a
garden
is
important
this
varies
with
climates
in
a
cold
country
the
warmest
exposures
are
best
and
in
a
hot
climate
select
the
coolest
a
garden
combining
both
is
the
best
possible
the
warmest
exposure
is
good
for
early
vegetables
and
the
cooler
and
more
shady
for
the
main
crop
much
can
be
done
to
regulate
this
by
fences
and
buildings
they
will
be
warm
and
early
on
one
side
and
cool
and
late
on
the
other
a
rich
loam
is
always
best
to
convert
stiff
clay
or
light
sand
and
gravel
into
a
good
loam
is
an
easy
matter
on
so
small
a
plat
as
is
usually
devoted
to
a
garden
draw
an
abundance
of
sand
on
plow
deep
and
mix
well
and
one
winter
frost
will
so
pulverize
the
whole
that
it
will
be
in
excellent
condition
in
warm
climates
the
incorporation
of
the
sand
with
the
clay
is
effected
by
frequent
plowing
and
rains
on
sand
and
gravel
draw
plenty
of
clay
and
loam
if
it
can
be
easily
procured
thus
it
is
easy
to
form
a
good
friable
retentive
loam
adapted
to
every
variety
of
decayed
wood
and
are
excellent
for
manure
well
but
remember
that
it
is
possible
to
overfeed
the
soil
of
a
garden
so
as
to
render
it
unproductive
deep
plowing
or
spading
is
very
important
it
is
the
best
possible
remedy
for
excessive
drought
or
unusual
rains
the
water
will
not
stand
on
the
surface
when
it
first
falls
and
will
be
retained
long
in
the
soil
for
the
use
of
the
plants
the
soil
should
be
very
mellow
plowing
or
spading
too
early
in
hope
of
getting
earlier
vegetables
is
often
a
failure
the
earlier
the
better
if
you
can
pulverize
the
soil
otherwise
not
plowing
when
covered
with
a
heavy
dew
or
when
it
rains
gently
is
equal
to
a
good
coat
of
manure
a
garden
should
be
on
level
land
well
drained
if
much
inclined
rains
will
wash
off
the
best
of
the
soil
and
destroy
many
seeds
and
plants
no
weeds
should
be
allowed
to
grow
to
any
considerable
size
in
a
garden
early
and
frequent
hoeings
are
important
to
success
directions
for
the
cultivation
of
each
garden
vegetable
and
fruit
are
given
under
each
of
those
articles
respectively
methods
of
gardening
at
the
south
and
the
north
vary
but
little
in
the
main
articles
at
the
north
we
have
to
guard
against
too
much
cool
weather
and
at
the
south
against
too
much
heat
some
vegetables
that
need
planting
on
ridges
in
the
north
to
obtain
more
sun
and
heat
should
be
planted
on
level
land
at
the
south
to
guard
against
too
much
heat
and
drought
besides
this
the
main
difference
is
in
the
time
of
planting
which
varies
more
or
less
with
every
degree
of
latitude
or
every
five
hundred
feet
of
elevation
have
no
in
your
vegetable
or
fruit
garden
unless
it
may
be
a
few
on
the
and
these
had
better
be
by
themselves
the
plan
of
a
garden
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
depends
much
upon
its
size
and
necessary
situation
we
prefer
ornamental
shrubs
in
front
of
the
house
the
flowers
adjoining
it
and
passing
the
windows
of
those
rooms
that
are
constantly
occupied
and
the
in
the
rear
of
the
flowers
while
the
should
be
at
the
right
or
left
of
the
fruit
and
in
the
rear
of
the
kitchen
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
should
be
the
larger
extending
back
as
far
as
the
fruit
and
vegetable
garden
and
in
the
rear
of
it
the
and
other
the
best
fence
is
of
good
wrought
iron
sharp
and
strong
enough
to
exclude
all
intruders
when
this
can
not
be
afforded
a
good
hedge
made
of
the
plants
best
adapted
to
hedges
in
your
latitude
is
preferred
next
to
this
a
good
tight
all
should
have
alleys
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
within
four
rods
of
each
other
to
afford
space
for
carting
on
manures
a
of
one
acre
should
have
such
an
alley
through
the
centre
each
way
with
a
place
in
the
end
opposite
the
entrance
to
turn
around
a
arbor
or
one
rod
from
the
fence
on
all
sides
should
be
an
alley
four
or
five
feet
wide
other
small
alleys
as
convenience
or
taste
may
require
the
usual
way
is
to
sink
the
alleys
three
or
four
inches
below
the
level
of
the
beds
and
cover
with
gravel
tanbark
shells
we
strongly
recommend
raising
the
alleys
in
their
middle
at
least
four
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
beds
the
paths
are
always
neater
and
the
moisture
is
retained
for
the
use
of
the
plants
excessive
rains
can
be
allowed
to
pass
off
this
making
alleys
low
for
water
is
a
great
mistake
in

garlic
this
is
a
hardy
perennial
plant
from
the
south
of
europe
and
has
been
in
cultivation
as
a
garden
vegetable
for
hundreds
of
years
it
is
cultivated
as
the
onion
and
needs
much
ashes
bonedust
and
lime
in
the
soil
it
is
much
esteemed
in
some
countries
in
soups
it
is
but
little
used
in
the
united
states
it
is
used
at
the
south
as
a
medicinal
herb
we
know
of
no
important
use
of
garlic
for
which
onions
will
not
answer
as
well
and
therefore
do
not
recommend
garlic
as
an
american
garden
vegetable
those
who
wish
to
cultivate
it
will
pursue
the
same
course
as
in
raising
onions
from
sets
this
will
always
be
successful
gathering
fruits
this
is
almost
as
important
as
proper
cultivation
this
is
especially
true
of
the
pear
many
cultivators
raise
inferior
pears
from
trees
of
the
very
best
varieties
for
want
of
a
correct
knowledge
of
the
best
methods
of
gathering
preserving
and
ripening
the
fruit
complete
directions
will
be
found
under
each
fruit
geese
farmers
usually
are
opposed
to
keeping
geese
believing
them
to
destroy
more
than
they
are
worth
if
you
have
a
suitable
place
to
keep
them
they
may
be
profitable
they
should
have
a
pasture
with
a
fence
they
can
not
pass
enclosing
a
spring
pond
or
stream
they
do
better
to
have
a
little
grain
the
year
round
this
with
plenty
of
grass
in
summer
and
cut
roots
in
winter
will
keep
them
in
fine
condition
the
feathers
will
pay
the
cost
of
keeping
leaving
the
increase
and
feathers
of
the
young
as
profit
on
an
acre
or
two
one
hundred
geese
may
be
kept
and
if
the
proportion
of
males
and
females
be
right
they
will
yield
a

each
gooseberry
this
is
a
native
of
the
north
of
europe
and
asia
from
which
all
our
fine
varieties
have
been
produced
by
cultivation
our
own
native
varieties
are
not
known
to
have
produced
any
very
desirable
ones
probably
the
zeal
of
the
lancashire
weavers
in
england
will
surpass
all
that
americans
will
do
for
the
next
century
in
gooseberry
culture
they
publish
a
small
book
annually
giving
an
account
of
new
varieties
the
last
catalogue
of
the
london
horticultural
society
mentions
one
hundred
and
varieties
as
worthy
of
cultivation
a
few
only
should
receive
attention
among
us
gooseberries
delight
in
cool
and
rather
moist
situations
they
do
not
flourish
so
naturally
south
of
philadelphia
though
they
grow
well
in
all
the
mountainous
regions
and
may
produce
fair
fruit
in
many
cool
moist
situations
deep
mulching
is
very
beneficial
it
preserves
the
moisture
and
protects
from
excessive
heat
the
land
must
be
trenched
and
manured
deep
in
november
cut
out
one
half
of
the
top
both
old
and
new
wood
and
a
good
crop
of
fine
fruit
may
be
expected
each
year
for
five
or
six
years
when
new

very
open

as
not
exposed
to
mildew
we
recommend
spreading
dry
straw
or
fine
charcoal
on
the
surface
under
the
bushes
as
a
perfect
remedy
if
the
top
be
not
left
too
thick
there
is
no
necessity
for
mildew
on
gooseberries
the
fall
is
much
the
best
season
for
trimming
though
early
spring
will
do
varieties
are
divided
into
red
green
white
and
yellow
these
are
subdivided
into

are
all
we
think
that
need
be
cultivated
many
more
varieties
nearly
equalling
the
above
may
be
selected
but
we
are
not

that
any

thus
you
have

his
list
includes
most
of
those
we
have
recommended
above
the
varieties
are
less
important
than
in
most
fruits
provided
only
you
get
the
large
varieties
of
english
gooseberry
proper
cultivation
will
insure
success
whoever
cultivates
only
tolerably
well
the
houghton

will
be
sure
to
raise
good
berries
free
from

grafting
this
is
one
of
the
leading
methods
of
obtaining
such
fruits
as
we
wish
on
stocks
of
such
habits
of
growth
and
degrees
of
hardiness
as
we
may
desire
the
stock
will
control
in
some
degree
the
growth
of
the
scion
but
leave
the
fruit
mainly
to
its
habits
on
its
original
tree
the
advantages
of
grafting
are
principally
the
following
good
varieties
may
be
propagated
very
rapidly
a
single
tree
may
produce
a
thousand
annually
for
a
series
of
years
large
trees
of
worthless
fruit
may
be
changed
into
any
variety
we
please
and
in
a
very
short
time
bear
abundantly
fruits
not
easily
multiplied
in
any
other
way
can
be
rapidly
increased
by
grafting
early
bearing
of
seedlings
can
be
secured
by
grafting
on
bearing
trees
tender
and
exotic
varieties
may
be
acclimated
by
grafting
into
indigenous
stocks
fruit
can
be
raised
on
an
uncongenial
soil
by
grafting
into
stocks
adapted
to
that
soil
several
varieties
may
be
produced
on
the
same
tree
for
ornament
or
economy
of
room
dwarfs
of
any
variety
may
be
produced
by
grafting
on
dwarf
stocks
and
we
may
thus
grow
many
trees
on
a
small
space
a
variety
may
be
made
to
form
a
large
top
by
grafting
into
large
stocks
we
are
enabled
to
carry
varieties
to
any
part
of
the
world
at
a
cheap
rate
as
the
scions
properly
done
up
may
safely
be
carried
around
the
globe
of
grafts
may
be
made
to
live
put
in
in
any
month
of
the
year
but
the
beginning
of
the
opening
of
the
buds
in
spring
is
the
preferable
season
stone
fruits
should
be
budded
and
all
fruits
may
be
made
to
do
well
budded
budding
is
usually
only
practised
on
small
trees
while
grafting
may
be
performed
on
trees
of
any
size
and
preserving
mature
shoots
of
the
previous
growth
are
best
those
of
the
year
before
will
also
do
they
may
be
cut
at
any
time
from
november
to
time
of
setting
perhaps
the
month
of
february
is
best
they
may
be
well
preserved
in
moist
sawdust
in
tight
boxes
the
more
there
are
together
the
better
they
will
keep
they
keep
better
by
being
cut
a
little
below
the
beginning
of
the
last
growth
but
it
is
more
injurious
to
the
tree
they
may
be
kept
well
in
fine
sand
moist
and
cool
too
much
moisture
is
always
injurious
put
the
lower
ends
in
shallow
water
and
they
will
look
very
fine
but
not
one
of
them
will
live
scions
cut
in
the
fall
and
buried
six
inches
deep
in
yellow
loam
or
fine
sand
will
keep
well
till
next
spring
there
are
several
methods
of
grafting
only
two
of
which
deserve
particular
attention
these
are
and
tongue
or
splice
grafting
see
figures
illustration
illustration
is
performed
in
most
cases
when
scions
are
grafted
upon
stocks
much
larger
than
themselves
it
is
too
well
known
to
need
particular
description
tools
should
be
sharp
and
it
should
be
performed
before
the
bark
slips
so
easily
as
to
be
started
by
splitting
the
stock
it
endangers
the
growth
of
the
scions
the
requisite
to
success
in
all
grafting
is
to
have
some
point
of
actual
contact
between
the
inside
barks
of
both
the
scion
and
the
stock
this
is
more
certainly
secured
by
causing
the
scion
to
stand
at
a
slight
angle
with
the
stock
is
generally
used
in
grafting
on
small
stocks
seedlings
or
roots
with
a
sharp
knife
cut
off
the
scion
slanting
down
and
the
stock
slanting
up
split
each
in
the
centre
and
push
one
in
to
the
other
until
the
barks
meet
and
wind
with
thick
paper
or
thin
muslin
with
grafting
wax
on
one
side
this
is
generally
used
in
the
question
of
has
excited
considerable
discussion
recently
many
suppose
it
to
produce
unhealthy
trees
and
that
retaining
the
variety
is
less
certain
than
by
other
modes
is
a
cheap
and
rapid
means
of
multiplying
trees
and
hence
is
greatly
prized
by
nursery
men
practical
cultivators
of
illinois
have
assured
us
that
it
is
impossible
to
produce
good
rhode
island
greenings
in
that
state
by
that
they
will
not
produce
the
same
variety
we
see
no
principle
upon
which
they
should
fail
but
will
not
undertake
to
settle
this
important
question
for
ourselves
we
prefer
to
use
one
whole
stock
for
each
tree
cutting
it
off
at
the
ground
and
grafting
there

it
is
to
be
pressed

the
wound
made
by
sawing
and
splitting
the
limb
and
close
around
the
scions
so
as
to
exclude

and

clay

often
used
for
grafting

not

grapes
those
cultivated
so
extensively
in
europe
were
natives
of
persia
showing
that
they
may
be
acclimated
far
from
their
native
home
foreign
grapes
are
not
suitable
for
culture
in
this
country
except
a
very
few
varieties
which
do
well
in
the
southern
states
the
native
grapes
of
this
country
have
produced
some
excellent
varieties
which
are
now
in
general
cultivation
others
are
beginning
to
attract
notice
and
seedlings
will
probably
multiply
rapidly
and
great
improvements
in
our
native
grapes
may
be
expected
the
subject
of
deserves
attention
to
all
palates
the
grape
is
delicious
it
is
not
only
one
of
the
most
palatable
articles
of
diet
but
is
more
highly
medicinal
than
any
other
fruit
it
is
the
natural
source
of
pure
wine
pure
wine
made
of
grapes
is
only
to
be
procured
in
this
country
by
domestic
manufacture
probably
not
one
out
of
a
thousand
gallons
of
imported
wines
sold
as
pure
contains
a
drop
of
the
juice
of
the
grape
they
are
manufactured
of
poisonous
drugs
and
ardent
spirits
generally
common
whiskey
a
french
chemist
discovered
a
method
of
imitating
fermented
liquor
without
fermentation
and
distilled
spirits
without
distillation
his
process
has
been
published
in
this
country
in
book
form
and
by
subscription
and
while
those
books
are
unknown
in
the
bookstores
they
are
generally
possessed
by
prominent
liquor
dealers
and
the
practice
of
those
secret
arts
is
terribly
dangerous
to
the
community
antecedent
to
this
chemical
manufacture
of
poisonous
liquors
such
a
disease
as
was
unknown
thus
the
frenchman
discovery
filled
the
pockets
with
cash
and
the
land
with
mourning
over
frequent
deaths
by
a
disease
the
horror
of
which
is
equalled
only
by
hydrophobia
in
all
should
give
up
the
use
of
everything
purporting
to
be
imported
wines
or
liquors
wine
should
not
be
used
as
a
common
beverage
by
the
healthy
the
best
medical
authority
in
the
world
has
pronounced
it
absolutely
injurious
but
in
many
cases
of
sickness
especially
in
convalescence
from
fevers
it
is
one
of
the
very
best
articles
that
can
be
used
hence
a
pure
article
of
domestic
manufacture
should
be
accessible
to
all
the
sick
see
our
article
on
wine
the
luxury
of
good
grapes
can
be
enjoyed
by
every
family
in
the
land
who
have
a
yard
twenty
feet
square
in
the
cities
almost
every
house
may
have
a
grapevine
or
two
where
nothing
else
would
grow
allow
a
vine
to
run
up
in
the
rear
of
the

and
over
the
roof
of
a
wing
or
raised
two
feet
above
the

often
grown
in

some
climates
and
soils
are
much
better
suited
to
than
others
but
we
have
varieties
that
will
flourish
wherever
indian
corn
will
mature
for
vineyards
the
sides
of
hills
are
usually
chosen
sometimes
for
the
purpose
of
a
warm
exposure
but
generally
to
secure
the
most
perfect
drainage
a
northern
exposure
is
preferable
for
all
varieties
adapted
to
the
climate
to
mature
late
varieties
choose
a
southern
or
eastern
exposure
gravelly
with
a
little
sand
on
a
dry
subsoil
is
preferable
though
good
grapes
may
be
grown
upon
any
land
upon
which
water
will
not
stand
grapes
always
need
much
lime
if
the
vineyard
is
not
located
on
calcareous
soil
lime
must
be
liberally
supplied
especially
for
a
dry
subsoil
or
thorough

is
indispensable
to
successful
we
prefer
level

wherever
thorough

is
practicable
choice
grapes
are
propagated
by
grafts
layers
or
cuttings
new
ones
are
produced
from

the
more
kinds
that
are
cultivated
together
the
greater
will
be
the

a

crossed
with
a
large
one
or
an

or
kept
in

till
spring
in
the
fall
cover
up
the
young

the
second

the
young

should
be
set
in
the
places
where
they
are
designed
to
remain
by
efforts
to
get
new
varieties
we
may
adapt
them
to
every
latitude
from
the

these

a
month
later
fasten
down
with
pegs
having
a
hook
to
hold
the
vine
and
cover
up
with
earth
they
will
take
root
freely
at
the
joints
and
may
be
removed
in
autumn
or
spring
if
you
put
down
wood
too
late
or
do
not
keep
it
covered
with
moist
earth
it
will
fail
otherwise
it
is
always
sure
may
be
from
any
wood
you
have
to
spare
and
should
be
about
a

long
having
two

at
an
angle
of
degrees
one
bud
and
two
thirds
of
the

a
little
shade
and
moisture
will
cause
nearly
all
to

the

so
buried
as
to
have

and
preserved
as
scions
for
grafting
cuttings
made
in

are
less
sure
to

is
much
more
injurious
to

the
average
yield
of
wine
per

throughout
the
country
is
estimated
at
two
hundred

this
means
the
fine
foreign
varieties
may
be
brought
to
perfection
in
our
high
latitudes
with
most
of
the
best
kinds
this
can
be
done
by
solar
heat
alone
a
house
covered
with

at
an
angle
of
degrees
facing
the

will
answer
the
purpose
with
a
slight
artificial

the
finest
varieties
may
be
perfected
and
others
forwarded
so
as
to
have
fine

at
most
seasons
of
the
year
the
vines
are
planted
on
the
outside
of
the
grapehouse
and
allowed
to
pass
in
through
an
aperture
two
feet
from
the

one
hundred
feet
long
and

wide
filled
mainly
with
black

with
a
few
other
choice

would
afford
a
great
luxury
and
prove
a
profitable
investment
from
one
such
house
near
a
large
city
a
careful
cultivator
may
realize
a
thousand
dollars
per
annum
native
and
even
hardy
varieties
are
often
greatly
improved
by
cultivation
under
glass
or
by
a
little
protection
in
winter
the
isabella
grape
is
hardy
and
productive
in
western
new
york
in
we
noticed
a
vine
that
had
been
laid
down
in
a
dry
place
and
covered
slightly
with
earth
in
autumn
the
fruit
was
more
abundant
and
one
fourth
larger
than
that
on
a
similar
vine
by
its
side
that
had
remained
on
the
trellis
during
winter
this
shows
the
value
of
protection
even
to
hardy
vines
there
are
many
methods
and
the
question
of
preference
depends
upon
the
location
of
the
vines
the
space
they
may
occupy
and
the
taste
of
the
cultivator
there
are
four
principal
systems
the
cane
or
renewal
system
spur
system
and
spiral
or
hoop
training
the
renewal
system
we
prefer
for
trellises
put
posts
firmly
in
the
ground
eight
feet
apart
allowing
them
to
be
seven
feet
above
ground
after
they
are
set
put
slats
of
wood
or
wire
across
these
a
foot
apart
commencing
a
foot
above
the
ground
set
vines
eight
feet
apart
let
the
vines
be
composed
of
two
branches
coming
out
near
the
ground
these
can
be
formed
by
cutting
off
a
young
vine
near
the
ground
and
training
two
of
the
shoots
that
will
spring
from
the
bottom
these
two
vines
should
be
bent
down
in
opposite
directions
and
tied
horizontally
to
the
lower
slat
of
the
trellis
cut
these
off
so
as
to
have
them
meet
similar
vines
from
the
next
root
upright
shoots
from
these
will
extend
to
the
top
of
the
trellis
and
it
is
then
covered
and
the
work
is
complete
after
these
upright
canes
have
borne
cut
off
every
alternate
one
two
or
three
inches
from
its
base
and
train
up
the
strongest
shoot
for
a
bearer
next
year
thus
cut
off
and
train
new
alternate
ones
every
year
and
the
vine
will
be
constantly
renewing
and
be
in
the
most
productive
state
keep
the
vines
clipped
at
the
top
of
the
trellis
and
the
sap
will
mature
strong
buds
for
next
year
fruit
we
regard
this
the
most
effectual
of
all
training
the
principle
of
renewal
can
be
applied
to
any
form
of
vine
and
eminently
promotes
fruitfulness
many
complain
that
their
vines
though
liberally
pruned
do
not
bear
well
the
difficulty
may
be
that
the
new
wood
is
principally
removed
while
the
old
is
left
to
throw
out
shoots
bearing
abundance
of
foliage
and
little
fruit
more
of
the
old
wood
removed
and
more
of
the
young
saved
would
have
produced
less
vines
and
much
more
fruit
is
the
most
important
part
of
successful
mistakes
on
this
subject
are
very
injurious
let
vines
grow
in
their
own
way
and
you
will
have
much
wood
and
foliage
and
very
little
poor
fruit
some
cut
off
the
shoots
in
summer
just
above
the
fruit
and
remove
most
of
the
leaves
around
it
to
expose
the
fruit
to
the
sun
this
often
proves
to
be
a
ruinous
mistake
the
sap
ascends
to
the
leaves
and
there
amalgamates
with
what
they
absorb
from
the
atmosphere
and
thus
forms
food
for
the
vine
and
fruit
it
is
the
leaves
and
not
the
fruit
which
need
the
sun
the
leaves
are
the
lungs
upon
the
action
of
which
the
life
and
health
of
the
fruit
depend
blight
of
the
leaves
destroys
the
fruit
and
a
frequent
repetition
of
it
destroys
the
vine
should
not
be
pruned
at
all
until
three
years
old
as
it
retards
the
growth
of
the
roots
and
thus
weakens
the
vines
older
vines
should
be
freely
pruned
in
november
or
december
pruned
in
winter
they
bleed
in
the
spring
and
pruned
in
the
spring
they
will
bleed
tender
vines
not
protected
may
have
an
excess
of
wood
left
in
the
fall
to
allow
for
what
may
perish
in
winter
in
this
case
cut
away
the
dead
and
surplus
wood
in
spring
but
never
until
the
leaves
are
well
developed
so
as
to
prevent
bleeding
necessary
is
of
much
importance
remove
no
leaves
except
the
ends
of
branches
that
have
already
made
as
much
wood
as
they
can
mature
in
the
middle
states
this
should
be
done
about
the
last
of
july
and
at
the
south
a
month
earlier
weak
lateral
branches
that
bear
no
fruit
may
be
removed
but
not
all
of
them
for
it
is
on
the
wood
of
this
year
growth
that
the
fruit
will
be
found
the
following
season
old
wood
does
not
send
out
wood
in
spring
that
will
bear
fruit
the
same
season
that
wood
will
bear
fruit
next
season
if
allowed
to
remain
whoever
observes
will
notice
that
grapes
grow
on
young
shoots
of
the
same
season
but
they
are
shoots
from
wood
of
the
previous
year
growth
and
not
from
old
wood
many
suppose
if
they
trim
their
vines
very
closely
as
the
old
vines
send
forth
abundance
of
new
wood
and
it
is
new
wood
on
which
the
fruit
grows
of
course
they
will
have
abundance
of
grapes
and
they
are
disappointed
by
a
failure
the
explanation
of
the
whole
is
fruit
grows
on
new
wood
from
wood
of
previous
year
growth
and
not
from
old
vines
hence
in
lessening
a
vine
remove
old
wood
this
is
the
renewal
system
whatever
the
form
of
the
vine
and
is
the
whole
secret
of
successful
pruning
this
accounts
for
the
great
success
of
the
germans
in
producing
such
quantities
of
grapes
on
low
vines
in
their
best
vineyards
they
do
not
allow
their
vines
to
grow
more
than
six
or
seven
feet
high
and
yet
they
produce
abundantly
for
many
years
they
so
prune
as
to
have
plenty
of
last
year
wood
for
the
production
of
fruit
the
current
season
after
this
has
borne
fruit
they
remove
it
to
make
room
for
the
young
wood
that
will
produce
the
next
season
this
principle
is
applicable
to
vines
of
any
shape
or
size
you
may
choose
to
form
the
removal
in
summer
of
excessive
growth
and
shortening
the
ends
of
those
you
design
to
retain
throws
the
strength
of
the
vine
into
the
fruit
and
to
perfect
the
wood
already
formed
liberal
is
necessary
to
induce
the
formation
of
new
wood
the
next
season
for
bearing
the
following
year
parts
that
grow
late
do
not
mature
sufficiently
to
bear
fruit
the
next
season
hence
cut
off
the
ends
in
summer
and
let
what
remains
have
the
benefit
of
all
the
sap
of
the
grape
is
disposed
to
excessive
bearing
which
weakens
the
vine
and
injures
the
quality
of
the
fruit
liberal
pruning
in
autumn
does
much
to
remedy
this
evil
by
not
leaving
room
for
an
excessive
amount
of
fruit
hence
when
you
have
a
plenty
of
wood
cut
off
the
ends
so
as
to
leave
spurs
with
two
buds
or
at
the
most
only
four
when
too
much
fruit
sets
remove
it
very
early
before
the
juices
of
the
vine
have
been
wasted
upon
it
a
vine
cut
or
wounded
in
spring
will
bleed
profusely
sheet
or
two
or
three
thicknesses
of
a
bladder

and
bound

prevent
the
bleeding
is
very
destructive
in
confined
locations
without
a
good
circulation
of
air
sulphur
and
quicklime
separate
or
combined
dug
into
the
soil
around
the
vines
is
a
preventive
straw
or
litter
of
any
kind
spread
thick
under
the
vines
is
perhaps
the
best
remedy
the
action
of
it
is
in
every
way
beneficial
the
rosebug
spanworm
great
greenworm
and
many
other
insects
infest
grapevines
and
do
much
injury
the
large
worms
are
most
easily
destroyed
by
hand
the
small
insects
by
or
by
snuff
sprinkled
over
profusely
when
the
vines
are
wet
the
various
applications
recommended
in
this
work
for
the
destruction
of
insects
are
useful
on
the
grapevine
the
principle
is
to
apply
something
offensive
to
the
insects
without
being
injurious
to
the
vines
packed
in
sawdust
or
always
thoroughly
dried
by
heat
they
will
keep
well
until
spring
another
method
is
packing
them
in
or
wadding
the
latter
is
best
or
put
them
in
baskets
holding
no
more
than
four
or
five
quarts
cover
tight
with
cotton
and
hang
up
in
a
cool
airy
place
and
they
will
long
remain
in
good
condition
in
shallow
boxes
six
inches
deep
put
a
sheet
of
wadding
and
on
it
a
layer
of
bunches
of
grapes
not
allowed
to
touch
each
other
on
the
top
of
the
grapes
put
another
sheet
of
cotton
and
then
another
layer
of
grapes
and
so
the
third
covering
the
last
with
cotton
and
put
the
cover
on
tight
and
keep
in
a
cool
place
this
is
the
most
successful
method
a
new
method
is
to
suspend
hoops
by
three
cords
like
a
and
hang
the
bunches
of
grapes
all
around
it
as
near
as
possible
without
touching
on
little
wire
hooks
passing
through
the
lower
ends
of
the
clusters
allowing
the
stem
end
to
be
suspended
and
the
grapes
hang
away
from
each
other
and
if
the
place
be
not
damp
enough
to
mould
them
and
not
dry
enough
to
cause
them
to
shrivel
they
keep
exceedingly
well
it
requires
more
care
and
judgment
than
the
other
methods
a
very
cool
situation
without
freezing
is
essential
in
all
cases
it
is
also
necessary
to
remove
all
broken
or
immature
grapes
from
the
clusters
you
would
preserve
are
very
numerous
and
their
nomenclature
is
confused
as
that
of
other
fruits
it
is
utterly
useless
to
cultivate
foreign
grapes
in
the
open
air
in
this
country
they
succeed
very
imperfectly
even
in
the
southern
states
but
for
cultivation
under
glass
they
are
preferable
to
any
of
our
own
the
following
foreign

however
seriously
affected

an
evil
incident
to
the
heat
and
humidity
of
the
climate
it
being
very
warm
the
dews
and
rains
incline
the
fruit
to
decay
we
think
the
evil
may
be
prevented
by
two
very
simple
means
keep
the
vines
very
open
that
they
may
dry
very
soon
after
rain
and
train
them
to
trellises
from
six
to
ten
feet
high
and
over
the
top
put
a
coping
of
boards
in
the
shape
of
a
roof
extending
eighteen
inches
on
each
side
of
the
trellis
it
will
prevent
the
rain
and
heavy
dews
from
falling
on
the
grapes
and
is
said
to
preserve
them
perfectly
this
arrangement
is
about
equal
in
a
warm
climate
to
cold

there
is
a

of
varieties

not
suitable
for

culture
on
the
comparative

of
different

there
is
a

of
opinions
the
best
course
for
the

is
having
the

therewith
to

sir
john
sinclair
says
there
are
two
hundred
and
fifteen
grasses
cultivated
in
great

we
shall
notice
a
very
few
of
them
with
a
view
to
their
comparative

vernal
small
growth
yield
of
hay
light
for
pastures
it
is
very
early
and
grows
quickly
after
being
cropped
and
is
excellent
for
grows
well
on
almost
any
soil
but
most
naturally
on
high
meadows
it
grows
in
great
abundance
in
massachusetts
early
like
the
preceding
but
more
productive
and
more
nutritious
it
is
one
of
the
five
or
six
kinds
usually
sown
together
in
english
pastures
best
for
sheep
and
horses
of
the
united
states
cows
are
fond
of
it
in
england
it
is
taking
the
place
of
clovers
and
about
philadelphia
it
is
supplanting
timothy
it
is
earlier
and
therefore
better
to
mix
with
clover
for
hay
as
they
mature
at
the
same
time
grows
well
in
the
shade
and
on
both
loams
and
sands
springs
rapidly
after
being
cropped
colonel
powell
one
of
the
best
american
farmers
says
it
produces
more
pasture
than
any
other
grass
he
has
seen
in
this
country
two
bushels
of
seed
are
sown
on
an
acre
a
valuable
grass
deserving
increased
attention
it
will
produce
three
crops
in
a
season
grows
four
or
five
feet
high
and
should
be
cut
for
hay
when
in
blossom
of
all
grasses
it
is
the
earliest
and
best
for
green
fodder
cut
in
blossom
it
contains
more
nutriment
than
any
other
known
grass
grows
well
by
the
sides
of
ditches
and
is
well
adapted
to
wet
bogs
as
by
its
rapid
growth
it
keeps
down
coarse
noxious
grass
and
weeds
this
is
extensively
cultivated
in
scotland
and
in
the
north
of
england
it
is
mixed
with
clover
respecting
its
comparative
value
there
is
a
diversity
of
opinion
some
do
not
speak
well
of
it
clover
and
white
see
article
clover
this
yields
much
more
green
feed
at
a
single
crop
than
any
other
grass
for
soiling
cattle
it
is
one
of
the
best
and
may
be
cut
twice
as
often
as
red
clover
this
makes
a
good
crop
soon
after
time
for
planting
corn
common
corn
or
and
later
evergreen
sweet
corn
are
the
best
for
soiling
cattle
but
for
early
soiling
use
lucern
or
some
other
large
grass
lucern
needs
clean
land
or
cultivation
at
first
as
young
plants
are
tender
the
runs
down
very
deep
hence
hard
clay
or
wet
soils
are
not
favorable
it
stands
the
cold
in
latitudes
forty
to
degrees
in
this
country
better
than
red
clover
this
is
a
hungarian
variety
biennial
but
resows
itself
several
years
in
succession
on
good
clean
land
its
yield
of
hay
and
seed
is
abundant
needs
a
deep
dry
soil
and
stands
a
drought
better
than
any
other
grass
to
plow
in
as
a
fertilizer
or
for
soiling
cattle
it
is
valuable
wherever
it
will
flourish
adapted
to
calcareous
or
chalky
soils
considered
one
of
the
best
plants
ever
introduced
into
england
but
in
new
england
it
proves
almost
a
failure
it
requires
more
cool
moisture
and
less
frost
in
england
and
in
new
england
this
is
the
most
valuable
of
all
the
grasses
and
wherever
it
will
thrive
well
should
never
be
superseded
by
anything
else
for
hay
it
should
be
cut
when
the
seed
has
begun
to
harden
but
before
it
begins
to
shell
and
never
in
the
blossom
let
every
farmer
remember
that
timothy
cut
in
the
seed
contains
twice
as
much
nutriment
as
when
cut
in
the
blossom
hence
it
is
not
worth
more
than
half
as
much
for
hay
sown
among
clover
as
when
sown
by
itself
as
it
must
be
cut
too
early
to
avoid
losing
the
clover
we
can
not
find
this
described
in
agricultural
books
but
we
have
been
familiar
with
it
for
years
and
can
not
find
a
new
york
or
new
england
farmer
who
does
not
know
it
well
and
prize
it
highly
for
low
moist
rich
meadows
the
red
top
is
the
best
for
hay
of
any
known
grass
it
yields
abundantly
and
may
be
cut
at
any
time
from
july
to
last
of
september
the
hay
is
better
for
cattle
than
timothy
many
intelligent
gentlemen
insist
that
it
is
the
most
healthy
hay
for
horses
after
all
that
has
been
written
on
the
various
grasses
we
regard
it
best
for
farmers
throughout
the
continent
to
cultivate
only
the
following
for
early
pastures
and
pastures
through
the
season
and
for
lowland
pastures
and
for
hay
and
for
the
shade
of
to
be
plowed
in
as
fertilizers
and
for
soiling
cattle
and
time
of
sowing
is
important
some
prefer
the
fall
and
others
the
spring
fall
sowing
should
be
very
early
or
very
late
early
sowing
will
give
the
young
plants
strength
to
endure
the
frosts
of
winter
which
would
kill
late
sown
but
sow
so
late
that
it
will
not
vegetate
until
spring
and
it
will
come
up
early
and
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
droughts
of
summer
sown
late
in
the
spring
will
always
fail
except
when
followed
by
a
very
wet
season
sow
timothy
with
fall
grain
or
late
in
the
fall
or
on
a
light
snow
toward
the
close
of
winter
do
not
sow
clover
in
the
fall
as
the
young
plants
will
generally
fail
in
the
cold
winter
sow
it
on
the
last
light
snow
of
winter
and
it
will
always
succeed
roll
the
land
in
spring
on
which
you
have
sown
in
the
last
of
winter
it
will
benefit
the
grain
and
cause
the
to
catch
well
and
get
an
earlier
and
more
rapid
growth
let
all
who
would
not
lose
their
seed
and
labor
remember
that
not
sown
so
as
to
form
good
roots
before
the
frosts
of
winter
or
the
drought
of
summer
will
be
lost
the
plants
will
be
killed
sown
in
the
fall
one
peck
to
the
acre
will
produce
a
good
crop
the
next
season
greenhouse
greenhouses
vary
as
much
in
style
and
cost
as
dwellings
the
simplest
is
any
tight
enclosure
covered
with
a
glass
roof
at
an
angle
of
degrees
facing
the
south
and
kept
warm
by
artificial
heat
the
temperature
is
not
allowed
to
be
lower
than
forty
nor
higher
than
seventy
degrees
of
fahrenheit
this
will
keep
plants
growing
and
make
them
blossom
and
affords
a
good
place
for
starting
plants
to
be
transplanted
to
hotbeds
and
finally
to
the
vegetable
garden
after
frosts
are
over
there
is
but
one
main
danger
in
greenhouse
culture
and
that
is
obviated
by
a
little
care
it
is
allowing
the
air
to
become
too
much
heated
for
the
health
of
the
plants
they
require
but
little
heat
but
need
it
regularly
some
greenhouses
are
warmed
by
stoves
and
serve
a
good
purpose
others
have
a
stove
set
in
a
flue
which
is
built
in
the
wall
gradually
rising
until
it
has
passed
around
two
or
three
sides
of
the
building
place
three
or
four
pans
over
this
flue
at
different
points
and
keep
them
filled
with
water
the
fire
in
the
flue
will
heat
the
water
and
impart
both
warmth
and
humidity
to
the
atmosphere
which
is
very
favorable
to
the
health
and
growth
of
plants
such
a
house
is
favorable
to
the
growth
of
tender
exotic
fruits
and
plants
a
similar
house
without
any
artificial
heat
affords
an
excellent
place
for
the
cultivation
of
the
finest
varieties
of
foreign
grapes
gypsum
or
plaster
of
paris
the
fertilizing
properties
of
this
article
were
discovered
by
a
german
laborer
in
a
quarry
who
observed
the
increased
luxuriance
of
the
grass
by
his
path
when
the
dust
fell
from
his
shoes
and
clothes
this
led
to
experiments
which
demonstrated
its
fertilizing
power
with
the
protracted
controversies
on
gypsum
we
have
nothing
to
do
certain
important
facts
are
established
which
are
valuable
to
agriculturists
gypsum
is
valuable
as
an
application
to
the
soil
at
from
three
fourths
to
one
and
a
quarter
bushels
to
the
acre
on
poor
land
for
a
flax
crop
three
bushels
per
acre
applied
after
the
plants
were
up
and
when
wet
produced
a
great
crop
it
should
be
applied
only
once
in
two
years
or
in
very
small
quantities
every
year
applied
as
a
it
will
do
no
good
until
a
considerable
quantity
of
rain
has
fallen
upon
it
if
it
be
applied
in
the
spring
and
the
summer
prove
a
dry
one
its
greatest
effect
will
be
felt
the
next
season
its
most
marked
effects
are
on
poor
soils
on
land
already
rich
it
seems
to
produce
but
little
effect
on
dry
sandy
or
gravelly
soils
it
will
increase
a
clover
crop
from
one
fourth
to
two
thirds
sowed
among
clover
and
immediately
plowed
in
it
acts
powerfully
plants
of
large
leaves
feel
its
influence
much
more
than
those
with
small
ones
hence
its
excellence
on
clover
potatoes
and
vines
some
soils
contain
enough
plaster
already
the
farmer
must
determine
by
analysis
or
experiment
on
the
compost
heap
it
is
valuable
in
small
quantities
it
is
also
useful
on
all
long
coarse
or
fresh
manures
of
the
previous
winter
seeds
rolled
in
it
before
planting
vegetate
sooner
and
stronger
mixed
with
an
equal
quantity
of
ashes
and
a
little
lime
and
applied
to
any
crop
immediately
after
hoeing
or
when
just
coming
up
it
adds
materially
to
its
growth
it
is
better
to
apply
it
twice
on
first
coming
up
and
immediately
after
first
hoeing
small
quantities
are
best
it
will
ten
times
repay
the
cost
and
labor
upland
pastures
and
meadows
except
clay
soils
are
greatly
benefited
by
it
a
method
of
sowing
plaster
on
fields
of
grass
or
grain
is
to
sow
out
of
a
wagon
driven
slowly
through
the
field
the
driver
being
guided
by
his
former
tracks
while
two
men
sow
out
of
the
wagon
it
is
customary
to
put
plaster
and
ashes
mixed
around
the
hills
of
corn
or
throw
it
upon
the
plants
sown
on
the
field
of
hoed
or
hill
crops
its
effects
are
much
greater
than
when
only
put
on
the
hill
it
should
be
sown
equally
over
the
whole
ground
harrowing
the
very
liberal
use
of
the
harrow
is
one
of
the
principal
requisites
of
successful
farming
no
other
single
tool
does
so
much
to
pulverize
the
soil
as
the
harrow
a
full
crop
can
only
be
raised
on
a
fine
mellow
soil
seeds
planted
in
soil
left
coarse
and
uneven
will
vegetate
unevenly
grow
unequally
ripen
at
different
times
and
produce
unequal
quantities
many
farmers
insist
that
it
is
a
mere
notion
without
reason
to
harrow
land
four
or
five
times
and
roll
it
once
or
twice
not
one
in
five
hundred
believes
in
the
full
utility
of
such
a
thorough
working
of
the
soil
coarse
lumpy
soils
expose
the
seeds
and
roots
of
young
plants
to
drought
and
to
too
strong
action
of
the
atmosphere
see

on

sandy
and

land
whenever
you
please
if
you
work

the
effects
of
it
during
the
whole
season
harrow
land
the
first
time
the
same
way
it
was
plowed
the
form
of
a
harrow
is
of
no
importance
except
avoiding
the
butterfly
drag
that
seldom
works
well
the
square
harrow
with
thirty
teeth
is
usually
preferred
every
farmer
should
have
a
drag
also
corn
potatoes
peas
and
other
crops
that
are
planted
in
straight
rows
should
be
harrowed
just
after
coming
up
with
a
drag
drawn
by
two
horses
the
front
teeth
should
be
taken
out
that
the
row
may
pass
between
the
teeth
as
well
as
between
the
horses
such
a
cultivation
will
do
more
good
than
any
other
single
subsequent
one
it
stirs
the
whole
surface
pulverizing
the
soil
keeps
it
mellow
and
moist
and
destroys
the
weeds
and
all
at
the
best
possible
time
for
the
benefit
of
the
crop
no
other
form
of
cultivation
is
so
good
for
a
young
crop
try
two
acres
one
in
the
usual
way
and
the
other
by
harrowing
as
we
recommend
when
it
first
comes
up

you
will
never
after
neglect

all
your
hoed
crops
hay
farmers
differ
in
their
modes
of
making
and
preserving
hay
the
following
directions
for
timothy
and
clover
are
applicable
to
all
grasses
suitable
for
hay
as
they
are
all
divided
into
two
classes
and
the
or
grasses
proper
the
principles
involved
in
these
directions
may
be
considered
comparatively
well
settled
and
they
are
sufficient
for
all
purposes
cut
clover
when
half
the
blossoms
are
dried
and
the
other
half
in
full
bloom
cut
later
the
stalks
are
so
dried
that
they
are
of
much
less
value
cut
earlier
it
is
so
immature
as
to
be
of
small
value
for
hay
in
case
of
great
growth
and
lodging
down
clover
may
be
cut
earlier
as
it
is
better
to
save
hay
of
less
value
than
to
lose
the
whole
to
cure
clover
for
hay
spread
it
evenly
immediately
after
the
scythe
let
it
thoroughly
wilt
but
not
dry
rake
it
up
before
any
of
the
leaves
are
dry
so
as
to
break
and
put
it
in
small
cocks
such
as
a
man
can
pitch
upon
a
cart
at
once
or
twice
with
a
fork
this
should
be
on
and
not
up
from
a
winrow
in
the
former
case
it
will
shed
nearly
all
the
water
and
the
latter
method
suffers
the
rain
to
run
down
through
the
whole
unless
the
weather
be
very
wet
clover
will
cure
in
this
way
without
opening
until
time
to
haul
it
in
and
will
retain
its
beautiful
green
color
almost
equal
to
that
of
england
and
germany
cured
in
the
shade
which
at
two
or
three
years
old
appears
almost
as
bright
as
though
not
cured
at
all
if
the
weather
be
quite
wet
cut
clover
when
free
from
dew
or
rain
wilt
it
at
once
and
draw
it
in
put
as
much
as
possible
in
thin
layers
on
scaffolds
and
under
cover
to
cure
in
the
shade
put
the
remainder
in
alternate
layers
with
equal
quantities
of
dry
straw
with
one
peck
of
salt
to
a
ton
a
ton
may
bear
half
a
bushel
of
salt
less
is
better
and
more
is
injurious
to
stock
by
compelling
them
to
eat
too
much
salt
the
most
beautiful
and
palatable
clover
hay
is
that
cured
in
the
shade
on
scaffolds
and
afterward
mowed
away
timothy
should
never
be
cut
until
the
seed
is
far
enough
advanced
to
grow
careful
experiments
have
shown
that
cut
in
the
blossom
the
hay
will
contain
only
about
one
half
as
much
nutriment
as
when
cut
in
the
seed
but
before
it
commences
shelling
cure
as
clover
but
in
twice
as
large
cocks
and
never
salt
unless
compelled
to
draw
in
when
damp

too

the
question

country
so
much

in

parts
of
which
there
is
such
a
wanton

to
successful

the

are
not
equally
good
for

in
all
parts
of

there
are

we
consider
it

consequently
too
expensive
for

in

the

lower
parts
of
the

may
be
preserved
however
by
setting
them
out
for
a
hedge
on

ground
instead
of
ridges
as

plowing
a

three
feet
from

drain
off
surplus
water
mulch
thoroughly
in
the
fall
and
thus
protect
from
frost
until
they
have
been
set
in
the
hedge
for
three
years
and
they
may
succeed
and
make
a
good
live

to
raise

we
should
have

the

was

eminently

the
mistaken
notion
that

be

four

they

some
sow
a

crowd
them
in

labor
cutting
it
ten
days
before
it
is
ripe
or
allowing
it
to
stand
two
weeks
after
will
not
materially
injure
it
hemp
is
pulled
or
cut
cutting
as
near
the
ground
as
possible
is
the
better
method
the

on
the

and
cured
bound
up
in
convenient
handfuls
and
shocked
up
and
bound
around

it
is
an
improvement
to
shake
off
the
leaves
well
before
shocking
up
if
stacked
after
a
while
and
allowed
to
remain
for
a
year
the
improvement
in
the

is
worth
more
than
the
loss
of
time
there
are
two
methods
of
rotting
one
by
spreading
out
on
and
the
other
by
immersing
in
water
the
latter
is
much
the
preferable
mode
the
question
of
sufficient
rotting
is
determined
by
trial
hemp
is
broken
and
cleaned
like
flax
the
stalks
need
to
be
well
aired
and
dried
in
the
sun
to
facilitate
the
operation
extremes
in
price
have
been
from
three
to
eight
dollars
per
hundred
pounds
five
dollars
renders
it
a
very
profitable
crop
thorough
rotting
good
cleaning
and
neat
order
are
the
conditions
of
obtaining
the
first
market
price
an
acre
produces
from
six
hundred
to
one
thousand
pounds
of
lint
an
average
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
to
each
foot
of
height
of
the
stalks
hemp
exhausts
the
soil
but
a
mere
trifle
if
at
all
the
seventeenth
successive
crop
on
the
same
land
having
proved
the
best
nothing
leaves
the
land
in
better
condition
for
other
crops
it
kills
all
the
weeds
and
leaves
the
surface
smooth
and
even
hoeing
much
depends
upon
the
proper
and
timely
use
of
the
hoe
never
let
weeds
press
you
hoe
at
proper
times
and
you
never
will
have
any
large
weeds
as
soon
as
vegetables
are
up
so
that
you
can
do
it
safely
hoe
them
the
more
frequent
the
hoeing
while
plants
are
young
the
larger
will
be
the
crop
premium
crops
are
always
hoed
very
frequently
hoeing
cabbages
corn
and
similar
smooth
plants
when
it
rains
slightly
is
nearly
equal
to
a
coat
of
manure
but
beans
potatoes
and
vines
and
whatever
has
a
rough
stalk
are
much
injured
by
stirring
the
ground
about
them
while
they
are
wet
or
even
much
damp
we
have
known
promising
crops
of
vines
nearly
destroyed
by
hoeing
when
wet
hoeing
near
the
roots
of
vines
after
they
have
formed
runners
one
or
two
feet
long
will
also
nearly
ruin
them
the
same
is
true
of
onions
hoe
near
them
cutting
off
the
lateral
roots
and
you
will
lessen
the
crop
one
half
in
hoeing
make
no

high
hilling

originated
in

where
their

hops
these
are
native
in

found
growing
spontaneously
by

four
cuttings

many

on
account
of
being

less

deprives
the

to
be
kept
clean
of

by
hoeing
them
with
the

fall
of
the

to
prevent

put
a
large
shovelful
of
good
manure
on
the
top
of
each
hill
each
spring
before
the
hops
are
opened
spread
on
each
acre
eight
cords
of
manure
coarse
straw
manure
is
preferable
plow
both

when
in

beginning
of
august
open
the
hops
every
spring
by
the
middle
of
may
at
the
south
by
the
last
of

this
is
done
by
making
four
furrows
between
the
rows
turning
them
from
the
hills
the
earth
is
then
removed
from
the
roots
with
a

and
all
the
running
roots
cut
in
with
a
sharp
knife
within
two
inches
of
the
main

the
tops
of
the
main

must
also
be
cut
in
and
covered
with
earth
two
inches
deep
set
the

on

first
springing
of
the

on
a
pole
and
no
pole
more
than
sixteen
feet

neglect
this
and
multiply
poles
and
crowd
them
with

and
you
will
get
very
few
hops
select
the
most
thrifty
vines
for
the
poles
and
destroy
all
the
others
watch
them
during
the
summer
that
they
do
not
blow
down
from
the

they
must
be
picked
as
soon
as
they

that
bleeding
may

the
most

all
be
of

the
following
description
with

abbreviation
of
the
process
of
curing
by
william
blanchard
is
perhaps
as
complete
as
anything
that
can
be
obtained
much
depends
upon
having
a
kiln
for
the
convenience
of
putting
the
hops
on
the
kiln
a
side
hill
is
generally
chosen
for
its
situation
it
should
be
a

it
should

two
feet
square
at

and
at

eight
feet

is
deemed
a
convenient
size
on
the
top
of
the

sills
are
laid
having
joists
let
into

as
for
laying

three
fourths
of
an
inch
over
which
a
thin
linen
cloth
is
spread
and
nailed
at
the
edges
to
the
sills
a
board
about
twelve
inches
wide
is
set
up
on
each
side
of
the
kiln
on
the
inner
edge
of
the
sill
to
form
a
bin
to
receive
the
hops
fifty
pounds
after
they
are
dry
is
all
such
a
kiln
will
hold
at
once
the
larger
the
stones
made
use
of
in
the
construction
of
the
kiln
the
better
as
it
will
give
a
more
steady
and
dense
heat
the
inside
of
the
kiln
should
be
well
plastered
with
mortar
to
make
it
charcoal
is
the
best
fuel
heat
the
kiln
well
before
putting
on
the
hops
keep
a
steady
and
regular
heat
while
drying
hops
must
not
remain
in
bulk
long
after
being
picked
as
they
will
heat
and
spoil
do
not
stir
them
while
drying
after
they
are
thoroughly
dry
remove
them
into
a
dry
room
and
lay
in
heaps
and
not
stir
unless
they
are
gathering
dampness
that
will
change
their
color
then
spread
them
this
will
only
occur
when
they
have
not
been
properly
dried
they
are
bagged
by
laying
cloth
into
a
box
so
made
that
it
can
be
removed
and
give
opportunity
to
sew
up
the
bag
while
in
the
press
the
hops
are
pressed
in
by
a
screw
in
bulk
they
will
sweat
a
little
which
will
begin
to
subside
in
about
eight
days
at
which
time
they
should
be
bagged
if
they
sweat
much
and
begin
to
change
their
color
they
must
be
dried
before
bagging
the
best
size
for
bags
is
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
weight
in
a
bag
about
five
feet
long
common
or
bags
are
best
extensive
build
houses
over
the
kiln
that
they
may
be
able
to
use
them
in
wet
weather
in
this
case
keep
the
doors
open
as
much
as
possible
without
letting
in
the
rain
dried
without
sufficient
air
their
color
is
changed
and
their
quality
and
injured
these
houses
are
made
much
larger
than
the
kiln
in
many
instances
for
the
convenience
of
storing
and
bagging
the
hops
when
dry
in
this
case
tight
partitions
should
separate
the
storerooms
from
the
kiln
to
avoid
dampness
from
the
drying
hops
the
form
of
manuring
recommended
is
contrary
to
the
old
practice
of
putting
a
little
manure
only
in
the
hill
that
practice
exposed
vines
to
decay
and
destruction
by
worms
and
this
does
not
our

also
produces

equal

horse
this
noble
animal
is
in
general
use
and
everywhere
highly
prized
by
the
last
census
we
see
that
there
are
two
thirds
as
many
horses
as
cows
in
the
united
states
horses
and
over
six
millions
of
cows
but
valuable
as
is
the
horse
he
suffers
much
ill
treatment
and
neglect
from
his
master
to
give
a
history
of
the
horse
the
various
breeds
of
different
countries
and
the
efforts
to
improve
them
would
be
interesting
did
it
fall
within
the
limits
of
our
design
the
patronage
of
the
kings
and
nobility
of
england
has
done
much
to
elevate
the
horse
to
his
present
standard
of
excellence
it
has
now
become
the
custom
for
intelligent
gentlemen
in
rural
districts
in
all
enlightened
countries
to
give
much
attention
to
the
improvement
of
horses
unfortunately
some
of
that
enthusiasm
is
perverted
to
the
channel
of
a
practice
alike
injurious
to
horses
and
the
morals
of
men
a
few
brief
hints
are
all
we
have
space
for
where
a
volume
would
be
interesting
and
useful
the
farmer
should
exercise
constant
care
to
improve
the
breed
of
his
horses
it
pays
best
to
raise
good
horses
this
depends
upon
the
qualities
of
the
dam
and
sire
and
upon
proper
feed
and
care
this
is
a
subject
that
farmers
should
carefully
study
from
books
and
from
their
own
observation
the
most
important
matter
in
raising
horses
is
care
in
working
and
feeding
nineteen
out
of
twenty
of
all
sick
horses
are
made
so
by
bad
treatment
the
prevention
of
disease
is
better
than
cure
steady
and
even
hard
work
will
not
injure
a
horse
that
is
well
and
regularly
fed
but
a
few
moments
of
crowding
a
horse
speed
or
of
an
unnatural
strain
on
his
strength
may
ruin
him
let
it
always
be
remembered
that
it
is
speed
and
not
heavy
loads
that
most
injures
a
horse
a
mile
an
hour
too
fast
will
soon
run
down
your
horse
a
horse
fed
with
grain
or
watered
when
warm
is
liable
to
be
foundered
and
if
not
so
fed
as
actually
to
be
foundered
he
will
gradually
grow
stiff
horses
are
liable
to
take
cold
by
any
unreasonable
exposure
to
the
weather
in
the
same
circumstances
as
men
and
the
effects
on
health
and
comfort
are
very
similar
a
horse
having
become
warm
by
driving
should
never
stand
a
minute
without
a
blanket
when
a
man
goes
from
a
heated
room
or
in
a
perspiration
into
inclement
weather
he
takes
cold
the
moment
the
cold
or
storm
strikes
him
in
a
few
moments
the
effects
on
the
pores
of
the
body
are
such
that
there
is
no
particular
exposure
it
is
so
with
a
horse
he
takes
cold
when
you
are
only
going
to
allow
him
to
stand
but
a
minute
and
during
that
time
you
leave
him
uncovered
if
you
are
under
the
necessity
of
doing
an
unusual
day
work
with
a
horse
do
not
feed
him
heavily
on
that
day
unusual
feed
the
day
before
and
the
day
after
will
do
him
good
but
on
the
day
of
excessive
work
it
injures
him
never
feed
horses
too
much
they
will
often
eat
one
third
more
than
is
good
for
their
health
keep
the
bottom
of
the
trough
in
which
you
feed
your
horses
grain
plastered
over
with
a
mixture
of
equal
parts
of
salt
and
ashes
that
they
may
eat
a
little
of
it
when
they
please
when
the
water
of
your
horse
becomes
thick
and
yellowish
or
whitish
give
him
a
piece
of
rosin
as
large
as
a
walnut
pulverized
and
put
in
his
grain
if
a
horse
has
the
heaves
give
him
no
hay
or
oats
corn
ground
or
soaked
should
be
his
only
grain
and
green
in
summer
and
cornstalks
cut
fine
with
a
little
warm
water
on
them
mixed
with
meal
should
constitute
his
only
food
all
except
a
few
of
the
most
confirmed
and
cases
of
heaves
are
by
this
course
of
feeding
and
that
relief
is
permanent
as
long
as
the
feed
is
continued
and
it
frequently
effects
a
cure
so
radical
that
the
disease
will
not
return
on
a
change
of
food
to
bring
up
horses
that
have
had
hard
usage
and
poor
feed
and
to
secure
growth
in
colts
feed
them
milk
the
milk
of
a
is
not
more
profitably
used
in
any
other
way
than
fed
to
horses
and
colts
give
them
no
water
for
two
or
three
days
and
they
will
readily
learn
to
drink
all
the
sour
thick
milk
you
will
give
them
colts
will
grow
faster
on
milk
than
on
any
other
food
horses
should
be
often
rubbed
down
and
kept
clean
and
when
put
in
the
stable
wet
they
should
be
rubbed
dry
it
is
very
essential
to
the
health
of
a
horse
that
he
have
pure
air
stables
in
this
country
are
usually
airy
enough
but
if
the
stable
be
tight
it
should
be
well
ventilated
the
gases
from
a
wet
stable
floor
are
injurious
disinfecting
agents
are
good
remedies
a
little
spread
over
a
is
very
useful
these
brief
directions
followed
will
prevent
most
of
the
diseases
to
which
horses
are
subject
or
in
case
a
horse
be
attacked
he
will
have
the
disease
lightly
as
temperate
men
do
epidemics
horseradish
this
is
regarded
a
healthy
condiment
especially
in
the
spring
of
the
year
grated
with
a
little
vinegar
it
may
be
eaten
with
any
food
you
choose
small

esteemed
in
mangoes
when
steeped
in
vinegar
for
two
weeks
it
is
said
effectually
to
remove
freckles
from
the
face
any
pieces
of
the
roots
will
grow
in
any
good
larger

better

may
be
produced
by
trenching

two
feet
deep
and
putting
in

will
save
the
most
tender

will
speedily
recover

no
matter
how
far
the
points
lap
houses
it
is
not
our
design
to
give
an
extended
view
of
rural
architecture
but
this
work
can
not
be
complete
without
a
brief
notice
of
and
a
few
plans
for
such
buildings
adapted
to
the
wants
of
those
possessing
limited
means
we
hope
these
directions
and
plans
will
prove
important
aids
in
getting
up
cheap
yet
convenient
and
beautiful
country
residences
especially
in
all
the
newer
parts
of
the
country
our
reading
on
rural
architecture
and
an
extensive
observation
in
many
states
of

have
made
us
acquainted
with
nothing
combining

and
utility
better
than

how
far

uncertain
by

a
method
of
effecting
a

when
you
have
a
tree
that
it
is
difficult
to
propagate
in
the

you
may

stock
vigorous

may
by
this

be

so
also
may
a
tree
be
prolonged
beyond
its

age
as

by
inarching
young
shoots
we
can
only
recommend
this
to
the
curious
experimenter
who
has
little
else
to
do
insects
these
are
the
natural
enemies
of
fruits
and
plants
and
to
prevent
their
depredations
requires
much
care
there
is
no
universal
remedy
birds
and
young
fowls
especially
ducks
and
chickens
are
useful
in
a
garden
the
ducks
must
not
be
kept
there
too
long
they
will
appropriate
a
little
to
their
own
use
but
will
save
much
more
for
the
proprietor
insects
have
their
peculiar
tastes
for
particular
fruits
and
plants
of
which
we
have
treated
under
those
heads
respectively
success
in
many
branches
of
horticulture
and
pomology
depends
upon
attention
to
the
habits
of
insects
the
most
general
remedy
is
to
wash
trees
or
plants
with
a
strong
decoction
of
some
offensive
herb
or
with
soapsuds
tobacco
is
very
useful
for
this
purpose
iron

it
has
been
ascertained
by
analysis
that
iron
enters
largely
into
the
composition
of
the
pear
iron
filings
spread
under
them
or
worked
into
the
soil
increases
the
growth
of
and
improves
the
quality
of
the
fruit
irrigation
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
matters
that
can
engage
the
attention
of
agriculturists
of
the
present
day
a
stream
of
water
that
may
be
caused
to
flow
gently
over
a
field
or
different
parts
of
a
farm
at
pleasure
is
a
mine
of
wealth
plants
receive
their
food
from
the
air
and
water
we
shall
discuss
this
more
fully
when
treating
of
manures
a
poor
porous
sandy
or
gravelly
soil
usually
produces
a
fine
crop
in
a
wet
season
that
is
an
addition
to
the
soil
of
nothing
but
water
hence
all
springs
and
streams
can
be
turned
to
great
account
on
a
farm
or
garden
watering
gardens
by
hand
or
with
a
will
often
pay
better
than
any
other
expenditure
on
the
land
employing
a
man
in
a
dry
season
to
spend
his
whole
time
in
watering
five
acres
of
garden
of
berries
and
vegetables
as
cabbages
vines
onions
and
potatoes
will
pay
a
very
large
profit
strawberries
will
bear
twice
as
much
and
twice
as
long
for
daily
watering
after
they
begin
to
bud
for
blossoms
until
the
fruit
is
gone
it
is
a
necessary
caution
not
to
water
irregularly
and
only
occasionally
in
a
dry
season
better
not
commence
than
to
leave
off
or
neglect
it
in
a
dry
time
before
a
rain
read
further
in
our
article
on
watering
labels
it
is
important
on
many
accounts
to
have
and
shrubs
well
labelled
many
labels
have
been
invented
we
prefer
cole
as
given
in
his

to
any
other
take
a
piece
of
sound
pine
or

a
sharp

so
up
to

loosely
by
a
small
copper
or
brass
wire
transported
to
any

they
will
not
be

end
and
written
on
with
a
sharp
awl
and
narrow
at
the
other
end
to
be
bent
around
a

will
answer
a
pretty
good
purpose
any
soft
wood
made
smooth
and
a
little
white
paint
applied
and
written
on
with
a
good
pencil
will
preserve
the

for
a
long
time
fasten
with
small
wire
there
are
many
labels
but
we
know
none
preferable
to
the
above
by
all
means
make
labels
accurate
and
permanent
otherwise
great
losses
may
occur
by
budding
or
grafting
from
wrong
varieties
landscape
gardens
these
deserve
much
more
attention
than
they
receive
in
this
country
on
most
farms
land
enough
is
lying
waste
to
make
a
picturesque
landscape
at
a
small
expense
trees
planted
weeds
destroyed
grass
cultivated
and
paths
made
according
to
the
most
approved
rules
of
carelessness
would
secure
this
object
with
a
wealthy
man
the
omission
of
such
a
park
about
his
dwelling
is
hardly
pardonable
landscape
gardening
is
an
extensive
subject
we
can
only
give
a
few
of
the
most
general
simple
rules
that
may
be
practised
without
the
possession
of
very
large
means
place
the
house
some
distance
from
the
main
street
make
the
leading
to
the
house
at
least
twelve
feet
wide
and
do
not
allow
it
to
extend
in
a
straight
line
but
in
gentle
curves
around
clusters
of
trees
and
plats
of
grass
apparently
rendering
the
curves
necessary
have
no
large
trees
directly
in
front
of
the
house
plant
trees
of
the
thickest
and
greenest
foliage
near
the
house
and
those
of
more
open
tops
at
a
greater
distance
standard
pear
and
handsome
cherry
trees
do
well
planted
among
the
forest
trees
clusters
of
them
at
suitable
distances
are
not
only
beautiful
but
they
bear
exceedingly
well
they
are
well
protected
by
the
forest
trees
and
standing
alone
are
injured
less
by
insects
never
set
trees
in
a
landscape
garden
in
straight
rows
nor
trees
of
similar
size
and
form
together
nature
never
does
so
let
none
of
the
walks
be
straight
lines
but
curves
meandering
among
trees
and
grass
if
there
be
any
water
in
the
vicinity
let
there
be
an
open
space
giving
a
fair
view
of
it
from
the
house
if
you
have
a
stream
make
rustic
bridges
over
it
the
plainer
the
better
here
and
there
have
rustic
arbors
attached
to
all
this
should
be
three
other
gardens
one
of
flowers
another
of
vegetables
and
the
third
of
fruits
these
three
should
never
grow
together
ruin
vegetables
and
injure
flowers
and
flowers
in
a
vegetable
garden
are
mere
weeds
a
separate
plat
for
each
is
the
correct
rule
both
for
beauty
and
profit
all
this
need
require
but
little
time
and
expense
all
landholders
can
at
a
moderate
cost
live
amid
scenes
of
perpetual
beauty
while
the
rich
may
spend
as
much
money
in
this
way
as
they
choose
layering
this
is
a
method
of
propagation
by
bending
down
a
branch
and
fastening
it
under
the
soil
leaving
the
upper
end
projecting
until
it
takes
root
cut
half
way
through
the
branch
so
as
to
raise
the
top
and
fasten
it
at
the
point
where
it
is
cut
in
a
trench
with
a
stick
thrust
into
the
ground
over
it
nearly
horizontally
or
with
a
stick
having
a
hook
made
by
cutting
off
a
limb
cover
well
with
soil
and
mulch
it
and
water
when
dry
this
done
in
the
spring
in
august
the
branch
will
be
well
rooted
and
may
be
cut
away
from
the
parent
stalk
this
is
important
in
any
tree
or
shrub
like
the
snowball
difficult
to
propagate
by
slips
or
grafting
laying
in
trees
dig
a
trench
where
water
will
not
stand
and
lay
the
trees
in
at
an
angle
of
degrees
and
cover
the
roots
and
lower
part
very
closely
with
earth
in
this
way
they
may
be
well
preserved
through
the
winter
if
buried
so
deep
that
the
will
not
freeze
which
is
always
injurious
to
trees
that
have
been
removed
from
their
original
soil
such
freezing
is
always
destructive
to
trees
out
of
the
ground
small
trees
and
seedlings
may
be
covered
entirely
to
be
kept
through
the
winter
put
coarse
straw
manure
on
the
earth
over
trees
large
enough
for
setting
that
are
to
be
preserved
heeled
in
during
winter
and
straw
or
over
the
tops
during
the
coldest
weather
and
they
will
come
out
perfect
in
the
spring
if
not
ready
to
set
out
your
trees
at
once
you
may
preserve
them
in
perfect
condition
to
very
late
in
spring
in
this
way
by
raising
them
once
to
check
vegetation
and
putting
them
back
and
shading
their
stems
and
mulching
the
roots
after
the
commencement
of
warm
weather
trees
may
thus
be
preserved
in
better
condition
for
transplanting
than
those
left
in
the
nursery
and
they
will
make
a
larger
growth
the
first
season
leeks
these
are
said
to
be
natives
of
switzerland
we
think
this
doubtful
as
they
are
an
article
of
daily
food
in
egypt
and
were
so
highly
esteemed
there
centuries
ago
as
to
become
an
object
of
worship
they
are
used
as
a
to
give
a
flavor
to
soups
and
stews
they
are
not
bulbous
like
onions
but
have
a
long
stem
which
is
principally
used
they
are
transplanted
very
deep
so
as
to
obtain
a
long
white
neck
the
ends
of
the
roots
are
to
be
cut
off
when
transplanted
and
they
should
be
set
in
rows
a
foot
apart
and
from
four
to
six
inches
in
the
row
there
are
several
varieties
distinguished
mainly
by
the
width
of
the
leaves
the
or
the
and
the
we
know
no
use
of
leeks
for
which
onions
would
not
be
equally
good
and
hence
do
not
recommend
their
cultivation
lemon
this
is
the
finest
acid
fruit
grown
and
belongs
to
warm
climates
but
by
getting
good
budded
trees
from
the
south
and
setting
in
protected
from
severe
frosts
we
may
grow
lemons
in
abundance
at
the
north
by
a
system
of
acclimation
and
protection
we
anticipate
seeing
oranges
and
other
southern
fruits
grown
at
the
north
as
a
domestic
luxury
and
perhaps
at
a
profit
for
market
the
houses
necessary
for
protection
may
be
worth
more
for
other
purposes
than
their
cost
and
care
without
interfering
with
their
use
for
orange
and
lemon
culture
lettuce
the
varieties
are
numerous
and
most
of
them
do
well
on
very
rich
land
well
hoed
only
two
kinds
of
need
be
cultivated
the
and
the
the
has
a
very
thick
and
tender
leaf
continuing
to
be
excellent
up
to
midsummer
from
one
sowing
and
if
not
allowed
to
stand
nearer
together
than
six
inches
it
will
produce
fine
heads
the
brown
lettuce
is
very
large
and
very
good
there
are
other
earlier
kinds
and
many
others
that
form
large
heads
but
we
can
get
the
above
kinds
early
by
sowing
in
a
hotbed
and
transplanting
or
by
sowing
so
as
to
have
plants
get
of
considerable
size
in
the
fall
and
protect
by
covering
in
winter
these
will
be
suitable
for
the
table
early
in
the
spring
lettuce
does
better
for
transplanting
it
forms
larger
heads
than
in
the
original
bed
and
is
a
little
later
make
the
soil
very
rich
with
lettuce
is
more
affected
by
the
quality
of
the
soil
than
most
other
vegetables
this
is
a
pleasant
and
healthy
article
of
food
in
spring
and
early
summer
licorice
this
is
a
hardy
plant
from
southern
europe
the
root
in
substance
or
the
extracted
dried
juice
is
much
used
needs
a
deep
rich
soil
it
is
propagated
by
cuttings
of
roots
set
out
in
land
in
rows
three
feet
apart
and
one
foot
in
the
row
small
vegetables
may
be
grown
among
the
plants
the
first
year
afterward
keep
clear
of
weeds
and
manure
every
autumn
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
after
the
leaves
are
dead
take
up
the
roots
and
dry
them
thoroughly
this
does
well
at
the
south
a
few
roots
are
sufficient
for
a
family
and
the
demand
will
not
be
sufficient
to
require
its
culture
very
extensively
as
an
article
of
commerce
the
low
price
of
labor
in
southern
europe
enables
them
to
supply
the
demand
cheaper
than
can
be
afforded
in
this
country
lime
this
is
a
valuable
application
to
the
soil
for
wheat
it
is
very
important
except
on
soil
containing
a
large
proportion
of
calcareous
matter
usually
and
applied
as
a
or
plowed
or
harrowed
in
its
effects
are
important
on
moist
sour
land
producing
wild
grass
it
corrects
the
acidity
introduces
other
grass
and
prepares
the
soil
for
cultivation
on
hard
stiff
lands
it
has
a
tendency
to
make
them
friable
and
keep
them
in
a
mellow
condition
thus
saving
more
than
its
cost
in
the
labor
of
cultivation
very
valuable
in
a
compost
heap
so
much
may
be
applied
as
to
burn
the
soil
and
prove
injurious
it
will
not
do
as
a
substitute
for
everything
else

on
manures
lime
a
fruit
resembling
the
lemon
growing
in
the
same
climate
but
of
smaller
size
it
is
used
for
the
same
purposes
as
the
lemon
but
is
not
so
valuable
preserved
green
it
is
highly
esteemed
it
is
cultivated
as
the
orange
and
lemon
needing
the
same
protection
in
cold
climates
to
preserve
all
these
from
destruction
by
insects
wash
them
in
a
strong
decoction
of
bitter
or
offensive
herbs
or
with
tobacco
is
very
effectual
these
remedies
are
useful
on
all
location
this
is
important
to
everything
we
cultivate
but
as
everything
can
not
have
the
best
location
we
should
study
it
with
reference
to
those
things
most
affected
by
it
especially
fruits
fruits
escape
late
frosts
when
growing
near

peaches
are
very
liable
to
destruction
by
late
frosts
we
have
seen
them
all
frozen
through
in
one
night
and
turned
black
the
next
day
in
the
month
of
may
after
they
had
grown
to
the
size
of
one
season
when
there
were
no
peaches
in
any
other
locality
within
a
hundred
miles
we
knew
an
orchard
on
a
kentucky
hill
so
high
and
steep
that
it
took
miles
of
winding
around
the
hill
to
ascend
it
with
a
team
those
trees
were
perfectly
loaded
with
peaches
that
sold
on
the
tree
at
four
dollars
per
bushel
and
in
cincinnati
market
at
seven
to
eight
dollars
in
ohio
kentucky
and

there
are
such
hills
that
may
be
turned
to
more
valuable
account
than
any
of
the
rest
of
their

that
are
not

considered
good
for

is
true

grow
on
them
all
every
year
it
will
soon
be
a
great
object
with
american
farmers
to
cultivate
in
all
locations
to
which
they
are
adapted
even
in
this
new
world
we
shall
soon
be
dependent
on
cultivated
timber
for
and
building
purposes
our
native
forests
are
rapidly
disappearing
while
demand
for
timber
is
as
rapidly
increasing
probably
no
other
tree
is
so
profitable
for
cultivation
in
this
country
as
the
locust
it
is
of
rapid
growth
and
hard
and
durable
and
adapted
to
many
uses
the
locust
is
not
so
durable
as
the
native
as
found
in
parts
of
ohio
but
cut
at
a
suitable
age
and
at
the
right
season
of
the
year
it
is
as
durable
as
white
cedar
and
much
more
valuable
the
profits
of
the
culture
would
be
great
an
acre
of
fifteen
or
twenty
years
old
would
be
worth
fifteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
dollars
the
expense
of
growing
it
aside
from
the
use
of
the
land
would
be
trifling
the
grove
would
afford
a
good
place
for
fowls
while
the
blossoms
would
be
nearly
equal
to
white
clover
for
honey
the
limbs
would
make
excellent
wood
and
the
ground
would
need
no
planting
for
a
second
growth
fortunate
will
be
the
men
on
the
prairies
of
the
west
and
along
the
railroads
and
rivers
of
the
land
who
shall
early
plant
fields
of
locust
the
profits
of
it
will
greatly
exceed
the
increase
in
the
value
of
the
land
manures
soils
manures
and
preparing
the
soil
plowing
harrowing
are
the
three
great
subjects
in
any
good
agricultural
work
we
shall
treat
this
subject
under
the
following
divisions
the
substances
of
which
manures
are
composed
preparation
and
saving
of
manures
time
and
modes
of
application
the
principles
of
their
action
upon
plants
manures
are
of
two
classes
called
putrescent
and
fossil
the
putrescent
are
composed
of
decayed
or
decaying
vegetable
and
animal
substances
the
fossil
are
those
dug
from
the
earth
as
lime
marl
and
gypsum
all
vegetable
substances
not
useful
for
other
purposes
are
valuable
for
manure
rotten
wood
leaves
straw
and
all
the
vegetable
parts
of
stable
manure
and
any
spoiled
vegetables
or
grain
are
all
valuable
at
the
south
their
immense
quantities
of
are
a
mine
of
wealth
if
properly
prepared
and
applied
as
manure
animal
manures
consist
of
the
animal
parts
of
stable
manure
dry
and
liquid
parts
of
bones
brine
spoiled
meat
kitchen
slops
soapsuds
and
all
dead
animals
in
decaying
these
substances
all
pass
through
a
process
of
fermentation
left
exposed
without
suitable
care
they
become
unhealthy
and
offensive
it
is
probable
that
a
large
share
of
the
diseases
suffered
in
the
rural
districts
are
caused
by
these
impurities
and
the
impossibility
of
keeping
large
cities
free
from
these
substances
is
the
cause
of
their
increased
mortality
in
the
country
a
little
timely
caution
and
labor
in
removing
these
substances
and
regulating
their
fermentation
would
save
much
sickness
while
the
labor
would
pay
a
larger
profit
than
any
other
performed
on
the
soil
no
manures
should
be
allowed
to
ferment
or
decay
without
being
mixed
or
covered
with
enough
common
earth
sand
peat
or
muck
to
retain
all
the
gases
and
exhalations
of
such
putrescence
the
smallest
quantity
that
will
answer
is
one
load
of
earth
to
two
of
the
decaying
substances
the
proportions
reversed
would
be
better
put
one
bushel
of
lime
to
two
loads
two
quarts
of
ground
plaster
and
half
a
bushel
of
ashes
and
you
have
the
very
best
compost
heap
the
following
are
brief
general
rules
for
the
preparation
of
manures
it
is
always
most
economical
to
feed
cattle
in
the
stable
or
under
cover
and
never
have
manure
exposed
to
the
weather
but
if
cattle
must
be
fed
outdoor
let
them
be
fed
in
a
yard
lowest
in
the
centre
that
the
liquids
and
washings
may
run
into
the
centre
and
be
absorbed
by
straw
and
litter
put
manure
on
the
land
or
into
heaps
for
compost
before
very
warm
weather
always
feed
sheep
under
cover
and
keep
their
manure
from
rain
heap
it
together
with
earth
in
the
spring
or
apply
it
to
the
soil
at
once
manure
thrown
out
of
a
stable
should
be
kept
under
cover
out
of
the
rain
and
not
allowed
to
heat
in
winter
its
best
qualities
are
evaporated
by
fermentation
in
the
yard
manures
often
rained
on
in
winter
or
left
in
large
piles
without
intermixture
of
earth
lime
plaster
and
ashes
will
ferment
and
waste
construct
your
stables
so
that
the
liquid
manure
will
run
into
a
vat
filled
with
earth
muck
is
best
experiments
have
shown
that
the
liquid
manures
are
at
least
one
sixth
better
than
the
solid
a
gentleman
dug
a
pit
feet
square
and
four
feet
deep
and
walled
it
in
on
all
sides
he
filled
his
vat
from
a
cultivated
field
and
so
constructed
his
sewers
from
the
stables
adjoining
that
the
urine
saturated
the
whole
he
kept
fourteen
head
of
cattle
there
for
five
months
allowing
none
but
the
liquid
part
of
the
manure
to
pass
into
the
vat
he
spread
forty
loads
of
this
on
an
acre
for
ten
years
he
tried
equal
quantities
of
this
and
well
rotted
and
prepared
side
by
side
in
the
same
field
and
obtained
great
crops
but
in
no
stage
of
their
growth
could
he
see
that
crops
on
the
land
manured
from
the
stable
were
any
better
than
those
that
had
received
only
the
soil
from
the
vat
the
latter
were
quite
as
good
as
the
former
the
contents
of
his
vat
manured
seven
acres
or
half
an
acre
to
each
creature
stabled
the
result
is
proof
that
one
cow
discharges
urine
sufficient
in
five
months
to
manure
abundantly
half
an
acre
of
land
save
the
solid
manure
equally
well
and
a
cow
will
make
manure
enough
in
five
or
six
months
to
increase
a
crop
sufficiently
to
pay
for
herself
it
is
certainly
safe
to
say
that
a
careful
man
can
make
the
manure
of
a
cow
pay
for
her
body
every
year
is
not
this
an
important
branch
of
farming
operations
few
pay
sufficient
attention
to
it
fowls
should
roost
where
their
droppings
may
be
mixed
with
common
garden
soil
or
loam
the
manure
from
each
fowl
carefully
saved
and
judiciously
applied
will
pay
for
its
body
twice
a
year
the
hogstye
may
be
very
productive
of
manure
one
fourth
better
than
that
from
the
stable
connected
with
your
hogpen
have
a
yard
fifteen
feet
square
for
every
five
hogs
let
that
yard
have
no
floor
throw
the
straw
out
of
their
frequently
to
make
room
for
new
throw
into
the
yard
also
all
sorts
of
weeds
refuse
vegetables
peapods
also
the
dirt
that
will
naturally
accumulate
in
the
backyard
of
a
dwelling
including
sawdust
fine
chips
cleanings
of
cellars
scrapings
of
ditches
and
occasionally
a
load
of
loam
muck
or
clay
and
six
loads
of
manure
to
each
hog
may
be
made
that
will
prove
far
better
than
any
stable
manure
it
has
been
known
to
produce
fifty
bushels
of
corn
to
the
acre
when
produced
but
forty
bushels
old
wood
brush
and
chips
should
never
be
allowed
to
remain
on
uncultivated
useless
land
wood
throws
out
the
same
amount
of
heat
in
decaying
as
it
does
when
consumed
as
fuel
the
action
of
that
heat
on
the
soil
is
highly
beneficial
retaining
it
long
in
a
mellow
state
hence
all
wood
too
old
to
be
of
value
for
any
other
purpose
should
be
put
in
heaps
covered
up
till
decomposed
and
then
applied
to
the
soil
as
other
manures
for
potatoes
or
vines
but
especially
melons
it
is
preferable
to
any
other
manure
nothing
is
so
good
for
muskmelons
as
old
chips
from
the
woodyard
leaves
of
fruit
and
forest
trees
are
also
very
good
blood
and
offal
of
animals
hair
hoofs
bones
horns
refuse
feathers
woollen
rags
mud
from
sewers
rivers
roads
swamps
or
ponds
turf
ashes
old
brine
soapsuds
all
kinds
of
fish
oyster
and
clam
shells
all
are
valuable
and
no
part
of
them
should
ever
be
thrown
away
or
wasted
they
are
all
good
in
compost
heaps
or
applied
directly
to
the
soil
bones
are
best
ground
but
may
be
used
whole
pounded
or
chemically
dissolved
or
mixed
with
alternate
layers
of
fresh
they
will
be
decomposed
by
the
fermentation
of
the
manure
see
bones
perhaps
there
is
as
much
imprudence
in
wasting
manures
as
in
any
part
of
american
domestic
economy
one
who
leaves
his
stock
without
care
and
so
exposed
to
the
weather
as
to
lose
half
of
them
and
injure
the
others
is
not
fit
to
be
a
farmer
yet
many
waste
manure
that
would
produce
plants
for
man
and
beast
of
far
more
value
than
the
loss
of
stock
complained
of
and
yet
no
one
notices
it
it
is
a
matter
of
course
exciting
no
surprise
wastefulness
in
a
family
if
it
be
of
bread
flour
or
meat
is
considered
wicked
and
impoverishing
while
ten
times
that
amount
may
be
wasted
in
manures
that
would
enrich
the
soil
and
excite
little
or
no
disapprobation
we
hope
the
agricultural
periodicals
will
keep
this
subject
before
the
people
until
these
mines
of
wealth
will
no
longer
be
neglected
or
wasted
of
is
a
subject
that
has
been
much
discussed
and
respecting
which
intelligent
agriculturists
differ
materially
some
apply
them
extensively
as
a
for
grass
lands
this
does
much
good
but
probably
one
half
of
their
virtues
is
lost
by
washing
rains
and
by
evaporation
a
better
way
is
not
to
keep
land
down
in
grass
long
at
a
time
and
when
under
the
plow
manure
thoroughly
we
knew
a
piece
of
light
land
that
annually
produced
half
a
ton
of
hay
per
acre
the
owner
plowed
it
up
raised
a
crop
put
a
moderate
quantity
of
and
ten
loads
of
leached
ashes
to
the
acre
we
saw
it
in
haying
time
the
third
season
after
it
had
been
manured
and
subsoiled
and
seeded
down
and
they
were
then
taking
fully
three
tons
of
timothy
hay
from
an
acre
which
was
the
quantity
it
had
yielded
three
years
in
succession
without
any
if
a
of
manure
is
to
be
applied
harrow
the
land
quite
thoroughly
and
always
apply
the
manure
in
the
fall
it
is
worth
twice
as
much
as
when
applied
in
the
spring
the
rains
and
snows
of
winter
cause
it
to
sink
into
the
soil
while
the
heat
of
spring
and
summer
evaporate
it
a
mixture
of
plaster
lime
ashes
and
a
very
little
salt
sowed
on
meadows
immediately
after
haying
secures
a
good
growth
of
feed
much
sooner
than
it
will
come
on
other
meadows
it
also
increases
quite
considerably
the
hay
crop
of
the
following
season
it
is
a
universal
rule
not
to
allow
manure
to
lie
long
on
the
surface
to
which
it
is
applied
before
plowing
in
place
manure
in
heaps
as
large
as
will
be
convenient
for
spreading
and
spread
it
just
before
the
plow
never
spread
manure
one
day
to
be
plowed
in
the
next
when
manuring
in
the
hill
have
the
planters
follow
the
in
manuring
potatoes
in
the
hill
drop
the
potatoes
and
put
the
manure
on
them
and
cover
at
once
in
a
dry
season
the
yield
will
be
double
that
of
those
planted
in
the
usual
way
for
fall
grains
plow
in
the
manure
just
before
sowing
the
seed
this
is
better
than
plowing
it
in
under
the
sod
if
the
land
be
not
sod
land
and
you
can
plow
the
manure
in
only
deep
enough
to
cover
it
and
then
just
before
sowing
the
seed
plow
again
very
deep
the
effect
is
excellent
apply
manure
to
land
in
the
fall
or
just
after
harvest
and
plow
it
in
let
the
land
remain
till
spring
and
then
plow
deep
and
you
get
the
best
possible
effect
on
an
onion
crop
manure
does
the
most
good
on
the
surface
on
those
raised
from
sets
or
on
any
onions
after
they
get
large
enough
to
give
room
put
fine
manure
enough
to
keep
down
all
weeds
and
it
will
double
the
crop
gypsum
is
better
sowed
than
in
any
other
way
mixed
with
a
little
lime
and
salt
or
and
salt
the
effect
on
corn
is
better
than
from
either
alone
to
hoed
crops
apply
these
articles
twice
and
always
by
sowing
and
not
by
putting
it
around
or
upon
the
hills
the
effect
is
much
greater
sowed
besides
the
labor
that
is
saved
in
applying
guano
do
not
allow
it
to
come
in
contact
with
the
plants
as
it
is
apt
to
destroy
them
it
only
remains
to
consider
the
principles
on
which
manure
acts
upon
soils
and
produces
growth
in
plants
the
action
of
manure
on
the
soil
by
which
it
is
enabled
to
retain
and
appropriate
moisture
constitutes
its
main
if
not
its
whole
benefit
it
may
afford
a
stimulus
to
the
roots
of
plants
even
the
specific
manures
that
are
supposed
to
supply
organic
matter
to
particular
plants
may
impart
their
benefits
by
their
action
upon
the
air
and
water
facts
are
certainly
at
hand
to
show
that
the
great
and
leading
benefits
of
manures
are
in
their
control
of
moisture
and
where
that
control
is
not
needed
plants
get
a
great
growth
on
what
we
call
poor
soil
no
manures
either
fossil
or
putrescent
afford
any
considerable
food
for
plants
vegetation
receives
its
growth
mainly
from
water
and
from
the
atmosphere
facts
in
support
of
this
theory
are
abundant
a
trial
was
made
to
ascertain
whence
comes
the
matter
of
which
a
tree
is
composed
a
quantity
of
earth
was
weighed
and
then
put
into
a
tight
vessel
a
willow
shrub
was
also
weighed
and
planted
in
that
earth
and
the
vessel
covered
with
perforated
tin
to
keep
out
the
dust
for
a
year
and
a
half
it
was
supplied
only
with
pure
water
the
tree
was
then
taken
out
and
found
by
weight
to
have
gained
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
the
earth
was
then
as
before
and
weighed
and
its
weight
was
found
to
be
only
two
ounces
less
than
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
before
when
it
was
deposited
there
the
tree
then
must
have
received
its
growth
not
from
the
soil
but
from
the
water
or
the
atmosphere
or
both
another
fact
take
a
load
of
manure
dry
it
thoroughly
and
weigh
it
then
moisten
it
and
apply
it
to
the
soil
and
it
will
increase
the
weight
of
vegetation
from
ten
to
thirty
or
forty
times
its
own
weight
when
dry
and
yet
most
of
that
manure
may
still
be
found
in
the
soil
hence
it
can
only
feed
plants
in
a
very
limited
degree
its
action
must
be
on
air
and
water
or
the
control
it
gives
the
soil
over
those
elements
it
is
also
matter
of
common
observation
that
soil
well
manured
will
continue
moist
for
a
long
time
after
similar
land
by
its
side
but
which
has
not
been
manured
is
dried
up
hard
coarse
soils
dry
up
very
quickly
while
soft
mellow
and
friable
ones
will
endure
a
long
drought
the
gases
and
moisture
generated
by
the
decomposition
of
manures
produce
this
mellow
state
hence
the
necessity
of
having
that
decomposition
take
place
under
the
soil
or
of
plowing
in
the
manure
another
important
fact
bearing
on
this
question
is
that
what
are
regarded
very
poor
soils
such
as
light
sandy
or
gravelly
land
will
produce
good
crops
in
a
season
remarkable
for
the
frequency
of
showers
on
such
soils
crops
are
from
twice
to
four
times
as
large
in
a
wet
season
as
in
a
dry
and
yet
there
is
an
addition
of
nothing
but
moisture
and
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
have
it
stand
and
become
stagnant
among
the
roots
of
the
plants
yet
another
evidence
is
in
the
strength
of
clay
soils
a
hard
clay
is
very
unproductive
but
so
disintegrated
that
plants
can
grow
in
it
it
produces
a
great
crop
this
is
because
clay
is
of
so
close
a
texture
that
when
mixed
with
manure
turf
sand
or
muck
although
friable
it
retains
more
moisture
than
sand
or
ordinary
loam
this
is
the
reason
of
the
superior
fertility
of
land
annually
overflowed
with
water
as
egypt
in
the
vicinity
of
the
nile
it
is
not
that
the
nile
brings
down
deposites
from
the
mountains
of
the
moon
so
rich
above
all
that
is
in
the
valleys
below
the
entire
weight
of
all
that
a
river
deposites
on
ten
acres
would
not
equal
in
weight
the
increased
vegetation
of
a
single
acre
the
cause
of
the
increased
fertility
is
the
fact
that
the
deposite
is
so
fine
that
it
prevents
rapid
evaporation
and
thus
causes
the
soil
to
retain
moisture
for
the
large
growth
and
maturity
of
the
plants
one
more
evidence
is
found
on
our
sandy
pine
plains
our
common
as
beech
maple
elm
or
linden
will
not
flourish
there
such
land
will
produce
comparatively
no
corn
oats
or
wheat
but
rye
that
stands
drought
better
than
any
other
grain
grows
tolerably
well
but
such
plains
always
produce
an
enormous
growth
of
pine
timber
hardly
equalled
in
the
number
of
cords
to
the
acre
by
the
land
of
the
river
bottoms
why
is
this
does
a
maple
need
so
much
more
food
than
a
pine
or
is
it
in
the
habits
of
the
trees
it
is
not
in
the
richness
or
poverty
of
the
soil
but
in
the
adaptation
of
the
trees
to
reach
and
appropriate
moisture
the
roots
of
the
maple
and
beech
spread
out
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
it
being
a
light
porous
sandy
soil
it
does
not
retain
moisture
enough
to
promote
their
growth
but
whoever
notices
a
that
has
been
turned
up
from
the
roots
by
the
wind
will
see
that
the
roots
run
down
almost
perpendicularly
ten
or
fifteen
feet
into
the
sand
there
they
find
plenty
of
moisture
and
hence
their
great
growth
this
principle
explains
the
comparative
productiveness
of
all
soils
a
soil
composed
of
light
muck
or
a
kind
of
will
dry
up
soon
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
rapid
evaporation
hence
it
is
always
unproductive
for
want
of
suitable
moisture
mix
with
it
clay
to
render
its
texture
more
firm
and
it
will
retain
the
moisture
and
be
very
productive
clay
alone
is
too
solid
to
retain
moisture
it
runs
off
as
from
a
brick
mix
sand
with
it
and
it
becomes
mellow
and
retains
moisture
and
produces
great
growth
sand
allows
so
free
and
rapid
an
evaporation
that
it
is
unproductive
we
say
it
leaches
and
is
hungry
and
so
it
is
because
it
has
little
power
to
retain
water
our
manures
do
it
good
only
as
they
are
calculated
to
aid
it
in
controlling
moisture
if
we
apply
a
light
manure
as
we
would
to
clay
it
is
comparatively
useless
it
adds
no
firmness
to
the
texture
of
the
soil
and
hence
does
not
increase
its
capacity
for
controlling
water
on
such
land
the
only
good
that
manure
does
is
while
decomposition
is
taking
place
in
the
soil
it
renders
it
more
moist
and
hence
more
productive
apply
clay
to
such
a
soil
and
it
will
increase
its
firmness
and
consequent
capacity
of
retaining
and
appropriating
moisture
and
thus
render
it
highly
valuable
dry
straw
manure
is
sometimes
said
to
dry
up
land
and
ruin
crops
so
of
turf
in
a
dry
season
in
a
wet
season
they
greatly
increase
the
growth
of
crops
now
they
contain
just
as
much
food
for
plants
in
one
season
as
another
hence
a
soil
too
easily
impervious
to
the
atmosphere
will
be
a
poor
soil
that
is
will
produce
poorly
simply
because
it
has
no
power
to
retain
the
necessary
moisture
we
suppose
these
facts
and
reasons
to
establish
our
theory
that
the
principal
benefit
of
manures
and
of
mixing
different
soils
is
in
the
control
they
give
over
the
moisture
and
the
atmosphere
hence
the
greatly
increased
crop
of
clover
from
the
application
of
three
quarters
of
a
bushel
of
plaster
to
an
acre
the
increased
weight
of
clover
on
five
square
rods
would
outweigh
the
plaster
applied
and
still
that
plaster
remains
in
almost
its
full
weight
on
the
soil
this
principle
explains
the
benefit
of
mulching
trees
plants
or
vegetables
this
is
the
best
means
of
preserving
trees
the
first
year
after
transplanting
and
of
securing
a
great
growth
of
any
kind
of
shrubs
or
plants
this
may
be
done
with
common
straw
or
leaves
now
wherein
is
their
utility
not
in
the
nourishment
they
afford
the
plants
but
in
the
fact
that
mulching
so
covers
the
surface
as
to
prevent
rapid
evaporation
in
such
cases
it
is
the
more
abundant
moisture
that
secures
the
greater
growth
hence
the
first
study
of
a
soil
culturist
should
be
to
ascertain
how
he
shall
so
mix
and
manage
the
materials
at
his
command
as
to
cause
them
to
retain
moisture
for
the
longest
time
without
leaving
water
to
stand
about
the
roots
of
his
plants
on
this
depends
the
whole
importance
of
deep
plowing
and
ditching
on
this
theory
we
may
also
account
for
the
fact
that
certain
plants
prefer
a
certain
kind
of
manure
to
all
others
it
is
that
those
plants
act
in
a
certain
manner
on
the
soil
requiring
a
specific
action
of
manure
to
enable
it
to
appropriate
moisture
and
tax
the
atmosphere
for
their
growth
this
theory
explains
why
too
much
manure
is
bad
not
because
we
give
too
much
food
to
plants
but
because
excess
of
manure
dries
up
the
land
but
whatever
theory
we
adopt
we
all
agree
in
the
utility
of
fertilizers
and
the
experience
of
practical
farmers
is
of
more
value
in
aiding
us
to
reach
right
conclusions
than
all
chemical
essays
on
the
subject
that
have
ever
been
written
marl
this
is
one
of
the
best
distributed
and
most
universal
fertilizers
marl
proper
contains
nearly
equal
proportions
of
clay
and
lime
is
spoken
of
in
which
sand
and
lime
are
the
main
ingredients
are
to
be
applied
to
sandy
and
gravelly
soils
and
to
clayey
soils
are
very
valuable
and
seldom
contain
clay
marls
may
easily
be
known
even
by
those
not
at
all
acquainted
with
chemistry
apply
any
mineral
acid
or
even
very
strong
vinegar
and
if
it
be
a
marl
an
effervescence
will
at
once
be
observed
this
effect
is
produced
by
acid
upon
lime
marjorum
there
are
two
varieties
in
cultivation
the
an
annual
herb
and
the
a
hardy
perennial
they
are
grown
and
used
as
summer
savory
used
green
or
dried
for
winter
they
give
a
sweet
aromatic
flavor
to
soups
stews
and
dressings
the
cultivation
is
in
all
respects
like
other
of
the
kind
whether
for
medicinal
or
culinary
purposes
melons
there
are
two
species
musk
and
water
melons
which
are
subdivided
into
many
varieties
of
each
these
are
among
the
most
delicious
of
all
the
products
of
the
garden
a
little
use
makes
all
persons
very
fond
of
them
the
climate
of
the
middle
and
southern
states
is
well
adapted
to
raising
melons
much
better
than
the
same
latitudes
in
europe
the
following
brief
directions
will
insure
success
in
their
cultivation
a
light
rich
soil
is
always
desirable
there
should
always
be
a
little
sand
in
the
composition
of
soil
for
melons
if
not
there
naturally
supply
it
it
will
always
pay
the
warm
sands
of
long
island
and
new
jersey
are
the
best
possible
for
melons
especially
for
it
may
be
well
to
trench
deep
for
the
hills
and
mix
in
a
little
manure
and
cover
it
with
fine
mould
a
quantity
of
manure
left
in
bulk
under
the
hills
will
dry
them
up
at
the
worst
possible
time
when
you
plant
only
a
few
in
a
garden
mulch
your
with
chips
or
sawdust
from
the
or
leaves
and
decayed
wood
from
the
forest
and
you
will
get
a
great
growth
they
will
grow
luxuriantly
in
a
pile
of
chips
with
a
little
soil
in
a
where
hardly
any
other
plant
would
flourish
the
does
best
in
almost
pure
sand
if
it
be
enriched
with
liquid
or
some
other
of
the
finer
manures
plant
six
feet
apart
and
nine
feet
each
way
when
the
plants
become
established
never
leave
more
than
two
or
three
in
a
hill
the
product
will
be
greatly
increased
in
number
and
size
by
picking
off
the
end
bud
of
the
first
runners
when
they
show
their
this
causes
them
to
throw
out
many
strong
lateral
vines
which
will
produce
abundantly
the
attacks
of
striped
bugs
so
well
known
as
the
enemies
of
vines
and
also
of
the
black
fleas
or
hoppers
very
minute
but
quite
destructive
to
tender
vines
when
first
up
may
be
prevented
says
downing
by
sprinkling
near
the
plants
a
little
guano
as
but
a
small
portion
of
cultivators
will
have
it
or
can
obtain
it
we
recommend
to
put
many
seeds
in
a
hill
to
provide
for
the
depredations
of
the
bugs
and
sprinkle
offensive
articles
around
them
these
will
not
always
be
effectual
we
have
recommended
elsewhere
to
fence
each
hill
as
the
most
effectual
method
a
box
with
gauze
or
a
pane
of
glass
over
the
top
is
a
certain
remedy
in
every
case
it
also
greatly
promotes
the
growth
of
the
young
vines
this
is
equally
effectual
against
the
cutworm
and
all
other
insects
and
as
the
boxes
will
last
a
dozen
years
or
so
we
should
use
them
if
we
had
ten
acres
of
melons
but
by
early
and
late
planting
and
watchfulness
and
replanting
you
will
succeed
without
protection
an
excessive
quantity
of
does
not
increase
the
growth
especially
of
plaster
bonedust
and
ashes
are
good
applications
is
the
best
of
all
the
seeds
should
be
soaked
two
days
and
planted
an
inch
deep
on
broad
hills
raised
in
the
centre
four
inches
above
the
level
of
the
bed
that
water
may
not
stand
around
them
planted
low
they
sometimes
perish
in
a
few
hours
in
a
hot
sun
after
a
rain
hoe
them
often
but
never
when
they
are
wet
and
never
hoe
near
them
after
they
have
commenced
running
the
roots
spread
about
as
much
as
the
vines
and
hoeing
deep
near
them
cuts
off
the
roots
and
materially
injures
them
many
a
promising
plat
of
melons
has
been
ruined
by
stirring
the
soil
when
they
were
wet
and
hoeing
around
them
after
they
had
begun
to
run
in
walking
among
melons
great
harm
is
done
by
stepping
on
the
ends
of
vines
no
one
should
be
allowed
among
melons
but
the
one
who
hoes
or
picks
them
many
are
lost
by
drought
after
great
care
we
have
often
used
an
effectual
remedy
it
consists
in
turning
up
the
vines
if
they
have
begun
to
run
before
the
drought
and
putting
around
each
hill
from
a
peck
to
half
a
bushel
of
wet
well
rotted
manure
that
from
a
spent
hotbed
is
excellent
for
this
purpose
and
hoe
from
a
distance
between
the
hills
and
cover
the
manure
an
inch
or
two
deep
with
fine
mould
lay
down
the
vines
and
saturate
the
hill
with
water
and
they
will
hardly
get
dry
again
during
the
season
a
little
judicious
watering
will
give
you
a
great
crop
in
the
most
severe
drought
of
the
these
are
numerous
and
the
nomenclature
uncertain
the
london
horticultural
society
catalogue
enumerates
seventy
most
of
them
are
of
no
use
to
any
one
two
or
three
of
the
best
are
sufficient
there
are
three
general
classes
of
the
as
the
citron
and
nutmeg
as
the
cantelope
or
long
yellow
and
the
last
is
the
finest
of
all
but
is
too
tender
for
general
cultivation
with
us
requiring
much
care
and
very
warm
seasons
the
are
very
large
but
much
inferior
in
quality
to
either
of
the
others
the
are
for
this
whole
country
the
nutmeg
has
long
been
celebrated
but
it
being
much
smaller
than
the
citron
and
in
no
way
superior
in
quality
we
think
the
latter
the
best
for
all
american
gardens
the
following
are
enumerated
in
white
gardening
for
the
south
as
adapted
to
the
latitude
of
the
southern
states
and
these
are
doubtless
all
fine
and
would
do
well
at
the
north
with
suitable
care
and
protection
catalogue
is
nearly
the
same
with
a
very
few
additions
of
are
also
numerous
and

uncertain
the
best

however
are
well
known
the
most
choice
are
the

is
a
fine
little

the

skin
separate
like
an
orange
these
varieties
will
all
do
well
with
care
to
preserve
any
one
of
them
it
must
be
grown
at
some
distance
from
other
varieties
all
should
be
far
removed
from

which
resemble
them

hybrids
partaking
of
the
qualities
of
both

often
very
fine
we
raised
a
cross
between
the
cantelope
and
the

was
excellent
seeds
of
most

better

being
two

as
they
produce
less

more

melons
are
a
luxury
that

to
the
two
preceding
mulching
this
is
placing
around
plants
or
trees
coarse
manure
or
litter
of
any
kind
to
keep
down
weeds
and
prevent
too
rapid
evaporation
of
moisture
all
straw
corn
stalks
old
weeds
or
stubble
forest
leaves
seaweeds
old
wood
sawdust
old
tanbark
chips
are
good
for
mulching
any
tree
taken
up
and
planted
with
reasonable
care
and
well
mulched
and
watered
will
live
one
of
fifty
need
not
die
cover
the
loose
earth
deep
enough
to
prevent
the
springing
of
weeds
put
a
little
earth
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
manure
leaving
it
dishing
about
the
tree
fill
that
occasionally
with
water
and
you
will
get
a
good
growth
even
in
a
dry
season
plant
gooseberries
or
currants
and
mulch
the
whole
ground
between
the
bushes
and
give
them
no
other
cultivation
and
the
berries
will
grow
nearly
twice
as
large
as
the
same
varieties
standing
neglected
to
grow
up
to
weeds
in
the
usual
way
mulching
with
clean
dry
straw
or
with
charcoal
is
a
preventive
of
mildew
it
is
the
easiest
method
of
taking
care
of
strawberries
after
they
are
in
blossom
the
vines
will
bear
much
more
and
finer
fruit
and
it
will
be
clean
and
neat
mulching
vines
is
a
great
means
of
insuring
a
crop
every
crop
that
can
be
mulched
will
be
greatly
benefited
by
it
hence
all
the
straw
and
litter
that
can
be
saved
is
money
in
the
pocket
for
mulching
alone
it
is
worth
five
times
as
much
as
it
can
be
sold
for
burning
or
in
any
way
destroying
cobs
cornstalks
stubble
old
straw
or
decaying
wood
is
extravagant
wastefulness
mushrooms
are
vegetables
growing
up
in
old
pastures
or
on
land
mulched
and
the
straw
partly
covered
with
soil
they
are
also
cultivated
in
beds
for
the
purpose
picked
at
the
right
stage
they
are
a
fine
article
of
diet
almost
equalling
oysters
the
use
of
the
wild
ones
however
is
attended
with
some
danger
for
the
want
of
knowledge
of
the
varieties
or
of
the
difference
between
the
genuine
mushroom
and
the
toadstools
that
so
much
resemble
them
persons
have
been
poisoned
unto
death
by
eating
toadstools
instead
of
mushrooms
when
of
middle
size
mushrooms
are
distinguished
by
the
fine
pink
or
flesh
color
of
their
gills
and
by
their
pleasant
smell
in
a
more
advanced
stage
the
gills
become
of
a
chocolate
color
they
are
then
apt
to
be
confounded
with
injurious
kinds
the
toadstool
that
most
resembles
the
true
mushroom
is
slimy
to
the
touch
and
rather
disagreeable
to
the
smell
the
noxious
kind
grows
in
the
borders
of
woods
while
the
mushroom
only
grows
in
the
open
field
it
is
better
however
not
to
eat
them
unless
gathered
by
a
practised
hand
so
as
to
be
sure
of
no
mistake
with
the
help
of
one
accustomed
to
gathering
them
you
will
learn
in
a
few
moments
so
as
to
be
accurate
and
safe
prepare
a
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
hothouse
or
in
the
absence
of
that
in
a
warm
dry
cellar
the
first
of
october
is
the
best
time
make
the
bed
four
feet
wide
and
as
long
as
you
require
it
should
be
one
foot
high
perpendicularly
at
the
edges
and
sloping
toward
the
middle
it
should
be
of
well
forked
and
put
in
compact
and
even
so
as
to
settle
all
alike
cover
it
with
long
straw
to
preserve
heat
and
the
exhalations
that
would
rise
at
the
end
of
ten
days
the
heat
will
be
such
as
to
allow
you
to
remove
the
straw
and
put
an
inch
of
good
mould
over
the
top
of
the
bed
on
this
put
the
spawn
or
seed
of
the
mushroom
in
rows
of
six
inches
apart
the
spawn
are
white
fibres
found
in
old
pastures
where
mushrooms
grow
or
in
old
spent
hotbeds
and
sometimes
under
old
stable
floors
the
warmth
of
the
bed
will
produce
mushrooms
plentifully
for
a
considerable
time
if
the
production
diminishes
and
nearly
ceases
it
may
be
renewed
by
removing
the
mould
and
putting
on
good
to
the
depth
of
twelve
inches
and
covering
and
planting
as
before
and
the
production
will
be
plentiful

of
weeks

are
two
kinds

of

the
white
mustard
is
cultivated
in
this
country
principally
for
greens
and
sometimes
for
a
small
salad
like
the
cress
it
may
be
sown
at
any
time
from
opening
of
spring
to
the
beginning
of
autumn
but
sown
in
hot
weather
the
bed
must
be
shaded
the
spaniards
prefer
the
white
mustard
for
grinding
for
table
use
because
of
its
mildness
and
its
whiter
flour
white
being
much
larger
than

new

that

is
a
matter
of
common
observation
but
the
manner
of
their
production
has
given
rise
to
much
diversity
of
opinion
the
theory
that
they
are
the
results
of
replanting
from
the
seeds
of
successive
generations
of
the
same
tree
is
called
the
van
mons
theory
after
van
mons
of
belgium
who
devoted
many
years
of
close
study
and
application
to
the
improvement
of
fruit
especially
of
pears
by
this
method
his
directions
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
plant
seeds
from
any
good
variety
of
fruit
let
those
seedlings
stand
without
grafting
until
they
bear
take
the
first
fruit
from
the
best
of
those
seedlings
and
plant
it
and
produce
other
seedlings
and
so
on
the
peach
and
plum
are
said
to
reach
a
high
state
of
excellence
in
the
third
generation
while
the
pear
requires
the
fifth
seeds
from
old
trees
are
said
to
have
a
great
tendency
to
return
to
their
wild
origin
while
those
of
young
improving
trees
will
more
generally
produce
a
better
fruit
the
seeds
from
a
graft
from
a
young
tree
does
not
produce
a
better
than
itself
the
succession
must
be
of
seedlings
this
theory
requires
long
practice
and
is
exposed
to
interruptions
by
the
crosses
that
will
necessarily
occur
between
different
trees
in
blossom
and
we
have
in
so
many
cases
had
a
fruit
of
great
perfection
arise
from
a
single
planting
of
seed
from
some
known
variety
that
we
must
conclude
the
improvement
to
be
produced
by
some
other
principle
than
that
of
the
van
mons
theory
the
evidence
is
in
favor
of
the
opinion
that
new
varieties
of
fruit
arise
from
in
the
blossoms
of
different
kinds
and
that
the
improvement
of
the
qualities
of
any
given
variety
is
the
result
of
cultivation
some
of
the
best
plums
we
have
are
known
to
have
been
the
product
of
fertilizing
the
blossoms
of
one
tree
from
the
pollen
of
another
this
is
constantly
taking
place
with
our
fruits
and
is
consequent
upon
our
mixed
orchards
let
this
be
attended
to
artificially
by
covering
branches
with
gauze
to
prevent
the
fertilization
by
bees
and
winds
and
make
the
cross
between
any
two
varieties
you
choose
and
the
results
may
prove
highly
beneficial
the
amateur
cultivator
may
render
essential
service
to
pomology
by
this
practice
we
know
that
all
our
choice
fruits
have
come
from
those
not
fit
for
use
it
is
not
improved
cultivation
of
the
old
barely
but
the
production
of
new
varieties
the
subject
of
further
improvement
therefore
demands
careful
study
and
practice
the
seeds
of
established
varieties
planted
at
once
without
drying
will
often
reproduce
the
same
we
are
not
certain
but
they
generally
would
if
not
affected
by
blossoms
of
contiguous
trees
nursery
of
this
subject
we
can
only
give
the
general
outlines
this
department
of
is
so
distinct
that
the
few
who
engage
in
it
as
a
business
are
expected
to
make
it
an
especial
study
in
a
work
like
this
it
is
only
desirable
to
give
those
general
principles
that
will
enable
the
cultivator
of
the
soil
to
raise
such
trees
as
he
may
desire
on
his
own
premises
these
directions
may
be
considered
reliable
and
as
far
as
they
go
are
applicable
to
all
nurseries
this
is
the
first
point
demanding
attention
if
a
piece
of
land
containing
a
variety
of
soils
can
be
selected
it
will
prove
beneficial
as
different
trees
require
different
soils
for
their
greatest
perfection
a
situation
through
which
a
rivulet
may
run
or
in
which
a
pond
may
be
constructed
fed
by
a
spring
or
hydrant
is
of
great
value
for
watering
the
situation
of
the
nursery
as
it
respects
shade
or
exposure
is
also
important
trees
should
generally
be
as
much
exposed
to
the
elements
in
the
nursery
as
they
will
be
when
transplanted
in
the
orchard
trees
removed
from
shaded
situations
to
the
open
field
will
be
stinted
in
growth
for
some
time
and
may
be
permanently
injured
never
allow
your
nursery
to
be
shaded
by
large
trees
bearing
trees
designed
to
show
the
quality
of
your
fruit
should
occupy
a
place
by
themselves
a
theory
that
has
had
many
adherents
is
that
trees
raised
on
poorer
and
harder
land
than
that
they
will
occupy
in
the
orchard
will
grow
more
vigorously
and
do
better
than
those
transplanted
from
better
to
worse
soil
thus
trees
have
often
been
preferred
from
high
hard
hills
to
transplant
in
good
loam
or
alluvium
on
the
same
principle
a
calf
or
colt
should
be
more
healthy
and
make
a
better
creature
for
having
been
nearly
starved
for
the
first
year
or
two
neither
of
these
is
true
give
as
great
a
growth
as
possible
while
young
without
producing
too
tender
and
spongy
wood
for
cold
winters
it
is
only
desirable
to
check
the
early
growth
of
on
the
rich
prairies
of
the
west
and
that
should
be
done
not
by
the
poverty
of
the
soil
but
by
or
this
prevents
a
spongy
tender
growth
that
is
apt
to
be
injured
by
their
trying
winds
trees
that
are
brought
from
a
colder
to
a
warmer
region
always
do
better
of
the
it
should
be
made
quite
rich
with
lime
and
and
cultivated
in
a
the
previous
year
any
roots
except
potatoes
those
left
in
the
ground
will
come
up
so
early
and
vigorous
in
the
spring
that
you
can
not
eradicate
them
without
destroying
many
of
your
young
seedlings
the
land
should
be
worked
very
deep
by
subsoiling
or
better
with
by
which
the
manure
and
are
put
in
the
bottom
as
manure
always
works
up
the
effect
will
be
excellent
buckwheat
is
good
to
precede
a
nursery
it
shades
the
ground
so
densely
as
to
protect
it
from
the
scorching
sun
and
effectually
destroy
all
weeds
trees
planted
on
land
prepared
by
see
our
article
on
plowing
will
make
one
third
greater
growth
in
a
given
time
than
those
on
land
prepared
in
the
ordinary
way
in
if
the
subsoil
be
very
poor
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
a
of
manure
worked
in
with
a
cultivator
thorough
draining
is
also
very
essential
to
a
nursery
of
the
general
practice
is
to
plant
in
the
fall
at
any
time
before
the
ground
freezes
the
better
way
is
to
keep
seeds
in
moist
sand
or
dry
and
spread
thin
until
spring
and
plant
as
early
as
the
ground
will
allow
freezing
is
of
no
use
seeds
had
better
be
frozen
to
open
the
stones
and
give
them
an
opportunity
to
germinate
the
advantage
of
is
the
ground
can
be
put
in
much
better
condition
and
the
seeds
will
start
quite
as
early
as
the
weeds
and
much
labor
may
be
saved
in
tending
of
plant
with
a
drill
that
will
run
about
an
inch
deep
putting
the
seeds
in
straight
rows
not
more
than
an
inch
wide
and
two
and
a
half
feet
apart
this
will
allow
the
use
of
a
small
horse
and
cultivator
which
will
destroy
nearly
all
the
weeds
use
a
or
hoe
across
the
rows
among
the
seedlings
and
very
little
weeding
will
be
necessary
it
is
not
more
than
one
fourth
of
the
ordinary
work
to
keep
a
nursery
clean
in
this
way
two
thirds
of
those
thus
planted
and
cultivated
will
be
large
enough
for
the
first
season
and
for
the
second
when
your
seedlings
are
six
inches
high
if
you
thoroughly
mulch
them
with
fine
straw
or
manure
you
will
be
troubled
with
no
more
weeds
and
your
trees
will
get
a
strong
growth
for
pull
up
those
of
suitable
size
very
late
in
the
fall
cut
off
the
tops
eight
inches
from
the
root
and
pack
in
boxes
in
moist
sand
and
keep
in
a
cellar
that
does
not
freeze
graft
in
winter
and
repack
them
in
the
boxes
with
moist
sand
sawdust
or
moss
and
keep
them
until
time
to
transplant
in
spring
they
should
not
be
wet
but
only
slightly
moist
in
the
spring
plant
them
in
rows
three
feet
apart
and
ten
inches
in
the
row
the
second
year
if
they
are
not
wanted
in
market
they
should
be
taken
up
and
reset
in
rows
four
feet
apart
and
two
feet
in
the
row
cut
off
the
ends
of
large
roots
to
encourage
the
growth
of
numerous
fibrous
roots
large
that
have
not
been
transplanted
are
of
little
value
for
the
orchard
being
nearly
destitute
of
fibrous
roots
but
large
trees
even
of
bearing
size
when
transplanted
in
the
orchard
do
quite
as
well
as
small
ones
provided
they
have
been
several
times
transplanted
in
the
nursery
this
produces
many
fibrous
roots
upon
which
the
health
and
life
of
the
tree
depend
in
many
regions
great
care
must
be
taken
to
prevent
destruction
of
young
trees
by
this
is
done
by
selecting
locations
and
by
constructing
or
removing
fences
to
allow
the
snow
to
blow
off
treading
it
down
as
it
falls
is
also
very
useful
both
in
protecting
the
trees
from
breaking
down
by
the
settling
of
drifts
in
a
thaw
and
from
the
depredations
of
mice
under
the
snow
trees
should
be
taken
up
from
the
nursery
with
the
least
possible
injury
to
the
roots
do
not
leave
them
exposed
to
the
air
for
an
hour
not
even
in
a
cloudy
day
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
cover
the
roots
with
mats
straw
or
earth
protect
also
from
frosts
many
trees
are
ruined
by
exposure
to
air
and
frost
of
which
the
nurseryman
is
very
careful
in
all
other
respects
for
transportation
they
should
be
closely
packed
in
moist
straw
and
wound
in
straw
or
mats
firmly
tied
and
kept
moist
trees
cared
for
and
packed
in
this
way
may
be
transported
thousands
of
miles
and
kept
for
two
months
without
injury
nuts
more
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
nuts
would
add
materially
to
our
domestic
luxuries
there
are
so
many
nuts
in
market
that
are
the
spontaneous
productions
of
other
countries
or
raised
where
labor
is
cheap
that
we
can
not
afford
to
raise
them
as
an
article
of
commerce
but
a
few
trees
of
the
various
kinds
would
be
a
great
addition
to
every
country
residence
we
could
always
be
certain
that
our
nuts
were
fresh
and
good
a
small
piece
of
ground
devoted
to
nuts
and
occupied
by
fowls
would
be
pleasant
and
profitable
english
walnuts
do
well
here
we
have
varieties
of
hickory
nuts
native
in
this
country
which
to
our
taste
are
not
surpassed
by
any
other
chestnuts
are
easily
grown

filberts
peanuts
growing
in

and
even
our
little
forest
beechnuts
are
easily
raised
the
dwarf
chestnut
of
the
middle
and
southern
states
is
decidedly
ornamental
in
a
fruit
garden
its
qualities
are
in
all
respects
like
the
common
chestnut
only
the
fruit
is
but
half
the
size
and
the
tree
grows
from
five
to
ten
feet
high
in
all
our
landscape
gardens
and
in
all
places
where
we
retain
forest
trees
for
ornamental
purposes
it
is
better
to
cultivate
trees
that
will
bear
good
nuts
the
varieties
of
trees
interspersed
with
evergreens
make
a
beautiful
appearance
oaks
raising
on
a
large
scale
will
soon
be
demanded
in
this
country
in
some
sections
we
have
immense
quantities
of
native
oaks
but
they
are
fast
disappearing
and
the
present
expense
of
transporting
the
timber
to
places
where
it
is
needed
is
much
greater
than
would
be
the
cost
of
raising
it
a
million
of
acres
of
oaks
ought
to
be
planted
within
the
next
five
years
a
crop
of
white
oak
of
only
years
growth
would
be
very
valuable
and
or
fifty
acres
of
forty
years
growth
would
be
worth
a
handsome
fortune
especially
in
the
west
on
all
the
bluffs
in
the
west
they
grow
well
and
on
the
prairies
they
will
do
even
better
after
they
have
been
cultivated
a
few
years
the
application
of
a
little
common
salt
on
rich
alluvial
soils
is
a
great
advantage
in
growing
timber
preserve
acorns
in
moist
sand
during
winter
and
plant
in
the
spring
in
rows
six
feet
apart
to
give
opportunity
for
other
crops
among
them
for
a
year
or
two
to
encourage
good
cultivation
plant
a
foot
apart
in
the
row
that
in
thinning
out
good
straight
trees
may
be
left
at
three
or
four
years
old
thin
to
four
feet
in
the
rows
afterward
only
remove
as
appears
absolutely
necessary
trim
straight
and
smooth
the
question
of
transplanting
is
important
shall
we
plant
thick
as
in
a
nursery
and
then
transplant
or
shall
we
plant
where
they
are
to
grow
in
the
object
is
to
get
a
low
full
and
spreading
top
of
horizontal
branches
that
will
bear
much
fruit
this
is
eminently
promoted
by
transplanting
and
but
in
raising
timber
the
object
is
to
get
trees
of
long
straight
bodies
with
the
fewest
possible
low
branches
such
are
the
native
trees
of
the
forest
this
is
best
promoted
by
planting
thick
never
transplanting
and
keeping
all
the
lower
limbs
well
trimmed
off
these
directions
are
for
raising
timber
on
good
tillable
land
such
groves
may
be
good
for
pastures
and
for
for
a
long
time
beside
this
we
have
large
areas
of
rough
land
that
will
not
soon
be
brought
into
cultivation
for
other
purposes
fine
timber
may
be
grown
on
such
land
with
no
care
but
trimming
oats
this
is
one
of
the
great
staple
agricultural
products
of
all
regions
sufficiently
moist
and
cool
for
their
successful
growth
oatmeal
makes
the
most
wholesome
bread
ever
eaten
by
man
for
all
horses
except
those
having
the
heaves
oats
are
the
best
grain
to
such
horses
they
should
never
be
fed
corn
soaked
or
ground
is
best
they
are
valuable
for
all
domestic
animals
and
fowls
these
are
numerous
those
called
yield
the
largest
crops
but
of
these
there
are
several
varieties
the
genuine
oats
are
tall
heavy
the
most
productive
of
any
known
oats
and
other
new
varieties
are
coming
into
notice
most
of
these
are
the
siberian
under
other
names
and
perhaps
slightly
modified
by
location
and
culture
the
scotch
oats
and
those
usually
cultivated
will
yield
only
about
two
thirds
as
much
per
acre
as
the
true
siberian
the
same
difference
is
apparent
in
the
growth
of
straw
oats
will
produce
something
on
poor
land
with
bad
tillage
but
repay
thorough
fertilization
and
tillage
as
well
as
most
other
crops
enrich
the
land
work
it
deep
and
thoroughly
and
roll
after
harrowing
moist
cool
situations
are
much
preferable
for
oats
hence
success
in
warm
climates
depends
upon
very
early
sowing
oats
sowed
as
late
as
the
first
of
july
in
latitude
and
further
north
will
mature
yet
all
late
oats
even
with
large
straw
and
handsome
heads
will
be
found
to
be
only
from
one
half
to
two
thirds
filled
in
proportion
to
the
lateness
of
sowing
the
entire
of
an
depend
upon
harvest
as
soon
as
the
grain
begins
to
harden
and
the
straw
to
turn
yellow
allowed
to
get
quite
ripe
they
shell
badly
and
the
straw
becomes
useless
except
for
manure
cut
with
reaper
or
cradle
and
bind
all
grain
so
cut
is
more
easily
handled
thrashed
and
fed
mow
no
grain
that
is
not
so
lodged
down
that
a
cradle
or
reaper
can
not
be
used
the
straw
of
oats
cut
quite
green
is
nearly
as
good
as
hay
okra
a
valuable
garden
plant
easily
propagated
by
seeds
it
is
excellent
in
cookery
as
a
sauce
its
ripe
seeds
used
as
coffee
very
much
resemble
the
genuine
article
the
green
pods
are
much
used
in
the
west
indies
in
soups
and
pickles
plant
at
the
usual
time
of
in
rows
four
feet
apart
two
or
three
seeds
in
a
place
eight
inches
apart
in
the
row
leave
but
one
in
a
place
after
they
get
a
few
inches
high
and
hoe
as
peas
and
the
crop
will
be
abundant
olives
these
are
natives
of
asia
but
have
beyond
date
been
extensively
cultivated
in
southern
europe
is
an
important
article
of
commerce
in
most
countries
its
use
in
all
kinds
of
cookery
in
countries
where
it
flourishes
renders
olives
as
important
to
the
mass
of
the
people
as
cows
are
in
new
england
it
should
be
a
staple
product
of
the
southern
states
to
which
it
is
eminently
adapted
it
is
hardy
further
north
than
the
orange
with
protection
it
may
be
cultivated
with
the
orange
and
lemon
all
over
the
country

a
greater
age
than
any
other
an
italian
near
terni
is
believed
to
have
stood
since
the
days
of
pliny
once
set
out
the
trees
require
very
little
attention
and
they
flourish
well
on
the
most
rocky
lands
that
are
utterly
useless
for
any
other
purpose
calcareous
soils
are
most
favorable
to
their
growth
they
are
propagated
by
suckers
seeds
or
by
little
eggs
that
grow
on
the
main
stalk
and
are
easily
detached
by
a
knife
and
planted
as
potatoes
or
corn
olives
will
bear
at
four
or
five
years
from
the
seed
they
bear
with
great
regularity
and
yield
fifteen
or
twenty
pounds
of
oil
per
annum
to
each
tree
there
are
several
varieties
plantations
now
growing
at
the
south
are
very
promising
onions
of
this
garden
vegetable
there
are
quite
a
number
of
varieties
large
one
of
the
most
valuable
large
and
profitable
keeping
better
than
any
other
the
handsomest
variety
excellent
for
pickling
brings
the
highest
price
of
all
but
is
not
quite
so
good
a
keeper
as
the
red
or
yellow
and
does
not
yield
as
well
white
a
larger
white
onion
often
taken
for
the
true
it
is
a
good
variety
the
preceding
are
all
raised
from
the
black
seed
growing
on
the
top
egg
so
called
from
its
size
and
shape
on
good
rich
soil
the
average
size
may
be
that
of
a
which
it
resembles
in
form
it
is
of
a
color
and
more
mild
in
flavor
than
any
other
they
are
usually
raised
by
sowing
the
black
seed
very
thick
to
form
sets
for
next
year
those
sets
put
out
early
will
form
large
onions
for
early
market
that
will
sell
more
readily
than
any
other
offered
top
so
called
because
the
seed
consists
of
small
onions
growing
on
the
top
of
the
stalks
in
place
of
the
black
seed
of
other
onions
these
are
good
for
early
use
grow
large
but
are
poor
keepers
hill
or
potato
of
these
there
are
several
kinds
most
of
which
are
unworthy
of
cultivation
the
is
the
only
valuable
variety
the
small
onions
for
sets
grow
in
the
ground
from
the
same
roots
by
the
side
of
the
main
onion
some
of
these
grow
large
enough
for
cooking
the
main
onion
is
the
earliest
known
grows
large
and
has
a
mild
pleasant
flavor
they
will
mature
at
a
certain
season
whatever
time
you
plant
them
hence
they
must
be
planted
very
early
to
produce
a
good
crop
we
have
planted
them
on
good
ground
so
late
as
to
get
little
more
than
the
seed
they
are
fine
for
summer
and
fall
use
but
keep
poorly
the
foregoing
are
all
that
are
necessary
they
can
all
be
brought
forward
by
early
planting
of
sets
raised
the
previous
season
by
sowing
the
black
seed
so
thick
that
they
can
not
grow
larger
than
peas
or
small
cherries
good
sandy
loam
and
black
muck
are
the
best
soils
for
onions
any
good
garden
soil
may
be
made
to
produce
large
crops
good
well
rotted
and
leached
ashes
are
the
best
the
theory
of
shallow
plowing
and
treading
down
is
incorrect
the
roots
of
onions
are
numerous
and
long
the
land
should
be
and
thoroughly
pulverized
the
only
objection
to
a
very
mellow
is
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
seed
up
this
is
obviated
by
rolling
after
sowing
which
packs
the
mould
around
the
seed
so
as
to
retain
moisture
and
insure
vegetation
fine
manure
mixed
in
the
surface
of
the
soil
for
onions
is
highly
beneficial
on
no
other
crop
does
manure
on
the
surface
do
so
much
good
mulching
the
whole
bed
as
soon
as
the
plants
are
large
enough
is
in
the
highest
degree
beneficial
both
in
promoting
growth
and
keeping
down
weeds
an
must
be
made
very
smooth
and
level
to
favor
very
early
hoeing
without
destroying
the
small
plants
all
that
come
up
small
are
tended
with
less
than
half
the
expense
if
the
surface
be
made
very
smooth
and
level
never
divide
your
into
small
beds
but
sow
the
longest
way
in
straight
narrow
rows
eighteen
inches
apart
for
convenience
of
weeding
and
hoeing
cultivate
while
very
young
and
work
the
soil
toward
the
rows
so
as
to
hill
up
the
plants
this
should
be
removed
after
they
begin
to
form
large
bulbs
breaking
down
the
tops
to
induce
them
to
bottom
is
a
fallacy
it
will
lessen
the
crop
rich
soil
deep
plowing
thorough
pulverizing
early
sowing
and
frequent
hoeings
will
insure
success
our
system
of
is
the
best
for
this
crop
they
will
do
equally
well
some
say
improve
for
twenty
years
on
the
same
bed
work
the
tops
into
the
soil
where
the
plants
grow
let
the
rows
be
very
narrow
and
very
straight
and
you
will
save
half
the
ordinary
expense
of
cultivation
gather
and
preserve
you
should
house
them
when
very
dry
a
day
exposure
to
a
warm
autumn
sun
is
very
beneficial
keep
them
in
an
open
barn
or
shed
until
there
is
danger
of
frost
a
warm
damp
cellar
always
ruins
them
keep
them
through
winter
in
the
coolest
dry
place
possible
without
severe
freezing
once
freezing
is
not
injurious
but
frequent
freezing
and
thawing
ruins
them
they
are
very
finely
preserved
braided
into
strings
and
hung
in
a
cool
dry
room

covers
a
variety
of
species
of
the

it
flourishes
well
on

and
all
along

of

it

if
protected
from
sudden
thawing
in
southern
europe
they
are
grown
abundantly
by
being
protected
by
a
shed
of
boards
they
may
become
perfectly
hardy
as
far
north
as
philadelphia
and
by
a
thorough
system
of
acclimation
and
a
little
winter
protection
they
may
be
grown
abundantly
in

state
of

to
have
been
discovered
in

one
of
the
largest

the
finest
of
all
oranges
and
the
tree
the
best
bearer
oranges
are
propagated
by
budding
and
cultivated
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
peach
orchards
an
orchard
is
a
plat
of
ground
large
or
small
occupied
by
trees
for
the
purpose
of
bearing
fruit
the
main
directions
for
orchard
culture
are
given
under
the
respective
fruits
any
soil
good
for
vegetables
or
grains
is
suitable
for
orchards
any
land
where
excessive
moisture
will
not
stand
to
the
injury
of
the
trees
may
be
adapted
to
any
of
the
fruits
set
pears
on
the
heaviest
land
peaches
on
the
lightest
and
the
other
fruits
on
the
intermediate
qualities
although
peaches
will
do
quite
well
on
light
soil
yet
they
do
better
on
a
rich
deep
loam
or
alluvium
when
it
is
desirable
to
set
out
an
orchard
on
land
originally
too
wet
a
blind
ditch
must
pass
under
each
row
extending
out
of
the
orchard
and
the
place
where
each
tree
is
to
stand
should
be
raised
a
foot
above
the
level
around
it
is
also
important
a
southern
or
eastern
exposure
is
preferable
in
all
latitudes
where
the
transitions
from
summer
to
winter
and
from
winter
to
summer
are
so
sudden
as
to
allow
but
little
alternate
thawing
and
freezing
this
would
therefore
be
the
rule
in
high
latitudes
in
climates
of
long

a
northern

trees
may
be
made
to
start
and
blossom
later
in
the
spring
by
snow
and
ice
about
them
well
pressed
down
in
winter
and
covered
with
straw
this
will
prevent
the
first
warm

and
cause
them
to
be
a
little
later
but
surer
and
better
ground
for
an
orchard
is
of
great
importance
plant
two
orchards
one
on
land
that
has
been
subsoiled
very
deep
and
the
other
upon
that
plowed
in
the
ordinary
way
and
for
ten
years
the
difference
will
be
discernable
as
far
as
you
can
distinguish
the
trees
in
the
two
orchards
of
all
kinds
are
good
for
orchards
except
coarse
stable
manure
which
should
be
composted
a
bushel
of
fine
charcoal
thoroughly
mixed
in
the
soil
in
which
you
set
a
will
exert
a
very
beneficial
influence
for
a
dozen
years
orchards
should
be
cultivated
every
alternate
three
successive
years
and
the
rest
of
the
time
be
kept
in
grass
just
about
the
trees
the
ground
should
be
kept
loose
and
free
from
weeds
and
grass
this
may
be
done
by
spading
and
hoeing
but
better
by
thorough
mulching
apples
feet
pears
twenty
feet
peaches
and
plums
sixteen
feet
pruning
destroying
insects
and
all
other
matters
bearing
on
successful
fruit

are
treated
under
the
several
fruits
oxen
every
farmer
who
can
afford
to
keep
two
teams
should
have
a
pair
of
oxen
for
many
uses
on
a
farm
they
are
preferable
to
horses
especially
for
clearing
up
new
land
oxen
to
be
most
valuable
should
be
large
well
matched
ruly
and
not
very
fat
they
should
be
kept
in
good
heart
by
the
quality
of
their
food
fast
walking
is
one
of
the
best
qualities
in
both
horses
and
oxen
for
all
working
purposes
provided
they
are
judiciously
used
and
not
overloaded
well
built
strong
animals
are
best
for
work
working
oxen
should
be
turned
out
for
beef
at
eight
or
nine
years
old
break
oxen
commence
when
they
are
very
young
put
calves
into
yokes
frequently
until
they
will
readily
yield
to
your
wishes
yoke
them
often
and
tie
their
tails
together
to
prevent
them
from
turning
the
yoke
and
injuring
themselves
if
left
without
training
until
they
are
three
or
four
years
old
they
will
improve
every
opportunity
to
run
away
to
the
danger
and
damage
of
proprietor
and
driver
it
is
quite
an
art
to
learn
oxen
to
back
a
load
place
them
before
a
vehicle
in
a
locality
descending
in
the
rear
as
it
rolls
down
hill
they
will
easily
learn
to
follow
backward
then
try
them
on
level
ground
then
accustom
them
to
back
up
hill
and
finally
to
back
a
load
almost
as
heavy
as
they
can
draw
breaking
vicious
animals
is
always
best
done
by
gentleness
we
have
known
vicious
horses
whipped
severely
and
in
every
way
treated
harshly
and
finally
given
up
as
useless
we
have
seen
those
same
horses
in
other
hands
brought
to
be
regular
gentle
and
safe
as
could
be
desired
by
mild
means
without
a
blow
or
harsh
word
oxen
should
be
driven
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
and
without
much
use
of
the
goad
the
usual
manner
of
driving
by
whipping
and
bawling
to
the
annoyance
of
the
whole
neighborhood
and
until
the
driver
becomes
hoarse
with
his
perpetual
screams
is
one
of
the
most
pernicious
habits
on
a
farm
oxen
will
grow
lazy
and
insensible
under
threat
or
scream
or
goad
driven
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
without
confusion
by
rapid
commands
and
no
whoa
put
in
unless
you
wish
them
to
stand
still
oxen
may
be
made
more
useful
on
a
farm
than
horses
their
gears
are
cheap
and
never
in
the
way
they
can
draw
more
and
in
worse
places
than
horses
and
it
costs
less
to
keep
them
the
various
methods
of
drawing
with
head
or
horns
in
vogue
in
other
countries
need
not
be
discussed
here
as
the
american
people
will
not
probably
change
their
yoke
and
bows
for
any
other
method
feed
oxen
as
other
animals
regularly
both
in
time
and
quantity
curry
them
often
and
thoroughly
it
improves
their
looks
health
and
temper
and
attaches
them
to
their
owner
parsley
this
is
a
hardy
biennial
highly
prized
as
a
garnish
and
as
a
for
flavoring
soups
and
boiled
dishes
the
variety
is
used
for
the
table
as
carrots
or
parsnips
the
principal
varieties
are
the
the
the
single
very
hardy
and
the
used
as
an
edible
root
the
is
well
known
easily
obtained
and
suitable
for
all
purposes
those
who
desire
the
roots
instead
of
parsnips
should
cultivate
the
hamburgh
or
it
needs
the
same
treatment
as
beets
seed
should
always
be
of
the
previous
year
growth
or
it
may
not
vegetate
it
is
four
or
five
weeks
in
coming
up
unless
it
be
soaked
twelve
hours
in
a
little
when
it
will
vegetate
in
two
weeks
by
cutting
the
leaves
close
even
and
regular
a
succession
of
fine
leaves
may
be
had
for
a
whole
year
from
the
same
plants
when
they
will
go
to
seed
and
new
ones
should
take
their
place
in
cold
climates
they
should
be
covered
in
winter
with
straw
or
litter
the
siberian
is
cultivated
in
the
field
sown
with
grass
or
the
small
grains
it
is
said
to
prevent
the
disease
called
in
sheep
and
is
good
for
surfeited
horses
the
should
not
be
sowed
in
an
excessively
rich
soil
as
it
produces
an
undue
proportion
of
tops
parsnips
english
authors
speak
of
but
one
variety
of
this
root
in
cultivation
in
england
the
french
have
three
the
the
and
the
the
first
runs
down
in
rich
mellow
soil
to
the
depth
of
four
feet
and
grows
from
six
to
sixteen
inches
in
circumference
the
lisbonaise
is
shorter
and
larger
round
the
siam
is
smaller
than
the
others
of
a
yellowish
color
and
of
excellent
quality
we
are
not
aware
that
our
little
carrot
so
early
and
good
is
included
in
the
french
varieties
we
cultivate
only
the
and
a
common
large
variety
both
are
good
for
the
table
and
as
food
for
animals
they
need
a
light
deep
rich
soil
a
sandy
loam
is
best
as
for
all
roots
seed
kept
over
one
season
seldom
vegetates
should
be
soaked
a
day
or
two
and
sown
in
straight
rows
covered
an
inch
deep
and
the
rows
slightly
rolled
it
is
much
better
with
this
and
the
carrot
to
sow
in
the
same
rows
they
come
up
so
soon
that
they
protect
the
parsnips
and
carrots
from
too
hot
a
sun
while
tender
and
also
serve
to
mark
the
rows
so
that
they
may
be
hoed
early
without
danger
of
destroying
the
young
plants
parsnips
may
be
grown
many
years
on
the
same
bed
without
deterioration
provided
a
little
decomposed
manure
or
compost
be
annually
added
fresh
manure
is
good
if
it
be
buried
a
foot
deep
the
yield
will
be
greater
if
thinned
to
eight
inches
apart
rows
two
feet
apart
and
the
plants
six
inches
in
the
row
are
most
suitable
in
they
will
grow
till
frost
comes
and
are
better
for
the
table
when
allowed
to
stand
in
the
ground
through
the
winter
they
may
be
dug
and
preserved
as
other
roots
parsnips
contain
more
sugar
than
any
other
edible
root
and
are
therefore
worth
more
per
bushel
for
food
all
domestic
animals
and
fowls
fatten
on
them
very
rapidly
and
their
flesh
is
peculiarly
pleasant
fed
to
cows
they
increase
the
quantity
of
milk
and
impart
a
beautiful
color
and
agreeable
flavor
to
the
butter
it
is
superior
to
the
beet
that
we
have
so
highly
recommended
elsewhere
in
all
respects
except
one
it
is
less
easily
tended
and
harvested
still
they
should
be
cultivated
on
every
farm
where
cattle
hogs
or
fowls
are
kept
pastures
these
are
very
important
to
all
who
keep
domestic
animals
the
following
brief
directions
for
successful
pasturing
are
essential
it
is
very
poor
economy
to
have
all
your
in
one
field
or
to
put
all
your
animals
together
pasture
fields
in
rotation
two
weeks
each
allowing
rest
and
growth
for
six
weeks
first
horned
cattle
next
horses
then
sheep
horses
feed
closer
than
cattle
and
sheep
closer
than
horses
each
also
eats
something
that
the
others
do
not
relish
pasturing
land
with
sheep
thickens
the
grass
on
the
ground
for
the
kinds
of
grass
preferable
for
pastures
see
our
article
on
plaster
sown
on
pastures
containing
clover
materially
increases
their
growth
a
little
lime
plaster
and
common
salt
sown
on
any
pasture
will
prove
very
beneficial
streams
or
springs
in
pastures
double
their
value
the
idea
that
creatures
need
no
water
when
feeding
on
green
grass
is
a
mistake
every
pasture
without
a
spring
or
stream
should
have
a
well
cattle
in
a
pasture
in
warm
weather
need
shade
it
is
usual
to
advise
the
growth
of
trees
in
the
borders
or
scattered
over
the
whole
field
sheds
are
much
better
trees
absorb
the
moisture
stint
the
growth
of
the
grass
and
injure
its
quality
a
pasture
containing
many
trees
is
not
worth
more
than
half
price
it
will
keep
about
half
as
much
stock
and
keep
them
poorly
bushes
which
so
often
occupy
pastures
should
be
grubbed
up
and
by
all
means
destroyed
so
should
all
thistles
briers
and
large
weeds
hogs
and
geese
should
be
kept
in
no
pastures
but
their
own
never
turn
into
pastures
when
the
ground
is
very
soft
and
wet
in
the
spring
the
tread
of
the
creatures
will
destroy
much
of
the
turf
creatures
in
pasture
should
be
salted
twice
a
week
the
age
of
grass
to
make
the
best
feed
for
animals
is
often
mistaken
most
suppose
that
young
and
tender
grass
is
preferable
this
is
far
from
correct
grass
that
is
headed
out
and
in
which
the
seed
has
begun
to
mature
is
far
more
nutritious
as
every
farmer
can
ascertain
by
easy
experiments
tall
grass
approaching
maturity
will
fatten
cattle
much
faster
than
the
most
tender
young
growth
pasturing
land
enriches
it
it
is
well
to
mow
pastures
and
pasture
meadows
occasionally
though
few
meadows
and
pastures
should
lie
long
without
plowing
of
manure
on
all
are
valuable
better
applied
in
the
fall
than
in
the
spring
evaporation
is
less
and
it
has
opportunity
to
soak
into
the
soil
peas
these
are
sown
in
the
field
and
garden
as
a
peas
and
oats
are
sown
together
and
make
good
ground
or
soaked
feed
for
horses
or
for
fattening
animals
early
peas
and
large
marrowfats
are
frequently
sown
broadcast
on
rich
clean
land
near
large
cities
to
produce
green
peas
for
market
it
does
not
pay
as
well
as
to
sow
in
rows
three
feet
apart
and
cultivate
with
a
horse
all
peas
for
picking
while
green
are
more
convenient
when
bushed
they
may
produce
nearly
as
well
when
allowed
to
grow
in
the
natural
way
but
can
not
be
picked
as
easily
and
the
second
crop
is
less
and
inferior
from
the
injury
to
the
vines
by
the
first
picking
early
kent
peas
the
best
early
variety
mature
so
nearly
at
the
same
time
that
the
vines
may
be
pulled
up
at
once
all
other
peas
had
better
be
bushed
that
they
may
be
easily
picked
and
that
the
later
ones
may
mature
bushes
need
not
be
set
so
close
as
usual
a
good
bush
put
firmly
in
the
ground
to
enable
it
to
resist
the
wind
once
in
two
and
a
half
feet
is
quite
sufficient
those
clinging
to
the
bushes
will
hold
up
the
others
to
bush
peas
in
this
way
is
but
little
work
and
pays
well
it
is
often
said
that
does
no
good
on
peas
are
neither
better
nor
more
abundant
for
its
use
we
think
this
utterly
a
mistake
we
have
often
raised
twice
the
quantity
on
a
row
well
manured
that
grew
on
another
row
by
its
side
where
no
manure
had
been
applied
if
peas
be
sowed
thick
on
land
the
crop
will
be
small
it
is
from
this
fact
that
the
idea
has
gained
currency
they
are
generally
planted
too
thick
on
rich
land
peas
planted
six
inches
deep
will
produce
nearly
twice
as
much
as
those
covered
but
an
inch
plowing
in
peas
and
leveling
the
surface
is
one
of
the
best
methods
of
planting
to
get
an
early
crop
in
a
cold
climate
they
may
be
forced
in
hotbeds
or
planted
in
a
warm
exposure
very
early
and
protected
by
covering
when
the
weather
is
cold
at
the
south
it
is
best
to
plant
so
as
to
secure
a
considerable
growth
in
the
fall
and
protect
by
covering
with
straw
during
cold
weather
the
only
known
remedy
for
the
bugs
that
are
so
common
in
peas
is
late
sowing
in
latitude
peas
sown
as
late
as
the
of
june
will
have
no
bugs
bugs
in
may
be
killed
by
putting
the
peas
into
hot
water
for
a
quarter
of
a
minute
plant
immediately
and
they
will
come
up
sooner
and
do
well
seed
imported
from
the
more
northern
parts
of
canada
have
no
bugs
it
is
probably
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
season
of
their
growth
but
late
peas
are
often
much
injured
by
mildew
this
is
supposed
to
be
caused
by
too
little
moisture
in
the
ground
and
too
much
and
too
cool
in
the
atmosphere
in
dew
or
rain
liberal
watering
then
would
prevent
it
are
numerous
two
are
quite
sufficient
the
earliest
we
have
ever
been
able
to
obtain
ripen
nearly
all
at
once
moderate
bearers
but
of
the
very
best
quality
this
variety
of
pea
is
the
only
garden
vegetable
with
which
we
are
acquainted
that
produces
more
and
better
fruit
for
being
sowed
quite
thick
the
other
variety
that
we
recommend
is
the
these
should
not
stand
nearer
together
on
rich
land
than
three
or
four
inches
and
always
be
bushed
there
are
many
other
varieties
of
both
late
and
early
peas
but
we
regard
them
inferior
to
these
white
gardening
for
the
south
mentions
landreth
extra
early
prince
albert
champion
knight
tall
marrow
and
new
mammoth
whoever
wishes
a
greater
variety
can
get
any
of
these
under
new
names
the
large
blue
imperial
is
a
rich
pea
like
many
of
the
dwarfs
both
of
the
large
and
small
but
is
very
unproductive
we
advise
all
to
select
the
best
they
can
find
and
plant
but
two
kinds
late
and
early
plant
at
intervals
to
get
a
succession
of
crops
but
very
late
peas
in
our
dry
climate
amount
to
but
little
without
almost
daily
watering
peach
this
native
of
persia
is
one
of
the
most
healthy
and
fruits
in
its
native
state
it
was
hardly
suitable
for
eating
resembling
an
almond
more
than
our
present
fine
peaches
perhaps
no
other
fruit
exhibits
so
wide
a
difference
in
the
products
of
seeds
from
the
same
tree
all
the
fine
varieties
are
what
we
call
chance
products
of
seeds
not
one
out
of
a
thousand
of
which
deserved
further
cultivation
the
prevailing
opinion
is
that
planting
the
seeds
is
not
a
certain
method
of
propagating
a
given
variety
hence
the
general
practice
of
budding
which
see
others
assert
that
there
are
permanent
varieties
that
usually
produce
the
same
from
the
seed
when
not
allowed
to
mix
in
the
blossoms
some
prefer
to
raise
the
trees
for
their
from
seed
thinking
them
and
more
healthy
whole
peaches
planted
when
taken
from
the
tree
or
the
pits
planted
before
having
become
dry
are
said
to
be
much
more
certain
to
produce
the
same
fruit
we
know
an
instance
in
which
the
fruit
of
an
early
crawford
peach
thus
planted
could
not
be
distinguished
from
those
that
grew
on
a
budded
tree
in
the
same
orchard
one
of
the
difficulties
in
reproducing
the
same
from
seed
is
the
great
difficulty
in
getting
the
seed
of
any
variety
pure
we
everywhere
have
so
many
varieties
of
in
the
same
orchard
that
the
seeds
of
no
one
can
be
pure
they
mix
in
the
blossoms
on
this
account
the
surest
method
of
perpetuating
a

the
following
directions
though
brief
are
complete
dry
the
pits
in
the
shade
put
them
away
till
the
last
of
winter
then
soak
them
two
days
in
water
and
spread
them
on
some
place
in
the
garden
where
water
will
not
stand
and
cover
them
an
inch
deep
with
wet
sand
and
leave
them
to
freeze
when
about
time
to
plant
them
which
is
early
time
take
them
up
and
select
all
those
that
are
opened
by
the
frost
and
that
are
beginning
to
germinate
and
plant
in
rows
four
feet
apart
and
one
foot
in
the
row
these
will
grow
and
be
ready
for
budding
considerably
earlier
than
those
not
opened
by
frost
crack
the
others
on
a
wooden
block
by
striking
their
with
a
hammer
you
thus
avoid
injury
to
the
germ
that
is
endangered
by
striking

plant
these
in
rows
like
the
others
but
only
six
inches
apart
in
the
row
as
they
will
not
all
germinate
plant
them
on
rich
soil
covering
an
inch
or
two
deep
keep
them
clear
of
weeds
and
they
will
be
ready
for
budding
from
august
to
september
according
to
latitude
or
season
in
a
dry
season
when
everything
matures
early
budding
must
not
be
deferred
as
long
as
in
a
wet
season
for
full
directions
for
budding
see
our
article
on
that
subject
perhaps
no
other
suffers
so
much
from
transplanting
when
too
large
this
should
always
be
done
after
one
year
growth
from
the
bud
the
best
time
for
transplanting
is
the
spring
in
northern
latitudes
subject
to
hard
frosts
and
in
autumn
in
warmer
climates
and
all
intelligent
are
aware
that
these
exert
a
great
influence
upon
the
size
quality
and
quantity
of
all
varieties
of
fruits
an
accurate
description
of
a
variety
in
one
climate
will
not
always
identify
it
in
another
some
few
varieties
are
nearly
permanent
and
universal
but
most
are
adapted
to
particular
localities
and
need
a
process
of
acclimation
to
adapt
them
to
other
soils
and
situations
light
sandy
soils
are
usually
regarded
best
for
the
peach
it
is
only
so
because
nineteen
out
of
twenty
cultivators
will
not
take
pains
to
suitably
prepare
other
soils
some
of
the
best
peaches
we
have
ever
seen
grew
on
the
richest
illinois
prairie
and
others
on
the
limestone
bluffs
of
the
ohio
river
thorough
drainage
is
indispensable
for
the
peach
on
all
but
very
light
porous
soils
with
such
drainage
peaches
will
do
best
on
soil
best
adapted
to
growing
corn
and
potatoes
bones
bonedust
lime
ashes
and
charcoal
are
the
best
applications
to
the
soil
of
a
whoever
grows
peaches
should
put
at
least
half
a
bushel
of
fine
charcoal
in
the
earth
in
which
he
sets
each
tree
mix
it
well
with
the
soil
and
the
tree
will
grow
better
and
the
fruit
be
larger
and
finer
for
a
dozen
years
any
good
soil
well
drained
and
manured
with
these
articles
will
produce
great
crops
of
peaches
for
the
location
of
see
our
general
remarks
on
location
of
but
we
would
repeat
here
the
direction
to
choose
a
northern
exposure
in
climates
subject
to
late
frosts
elevations
are
always
favorable
as
are
also
the
shores
of
all
bodies
of
water
in
our
remarks
on
location
we
have
shown
by
facts
the
great
value
of
hills
so
high
as
to
be
useless
for
any
other
purpose
between
pittsburgh
and
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
river
there
are
enough
high
elevations
now
useless
to
supply
all
the
cities
within
fifty
miles
of
the
rivers
down
to
new
orleans
with
the
best
of
peaches
every
year
in
no
year
will
they
ever
be
cut
off
by
frost
on
those
hills
warm
exposures
with
a
little
winter
protection
will
secure
good
peaches
in
climates
not
adapted
to
them
in
some
parts
of
france
they
grow
large
quantities
for
market
by
training
them
against
walls
where
they
do
not
flourish
in
the
open
field
by
this
practice
and
by
enclosures
and
acclimation
the
growth
of
this
excellent
fruit
may
be
extended
to
the
coldest
parts
of
the
united
states
should
be
performed
with
care
as
in
the
case
of
all
other
every
injured
root
should
be
cut
off
smooth
from
the
under
side
slanting
out
from
the
tree
leave
the
roots
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
position
in
which
they
were
before
set
the
tree
an
inch
lower
than
it
stood
in
the
nursery
it
saves
the
danger
of
the
roots
getting
uncovered
and
of
too
strong
action
of
the
atmosphere
on
the
roots
in
a
soil
so
loose
the
opposite
is
often
recommended
to
allow
the
tree
in
its
new
location
to
stand
an
inch
or
two
higher
than
before
but
we
are
sure
from
repeated
trials
that
it
is
wrong
shake
the
fine
earth
as
closely
around
the
roots
as
possible
mulch
well
and
pour
on
a
pailful
of
tepid
water
if
it
be
rather
a
dry
time
and
the
tree
will
be
sure
to
live
and
make
a
good
growth
the
first
year
when
a
is
transplanted
after
one
year
growth
from
the
bud
it
should
have
the
top
cut
off
within
eighteen
inches
or
two
feet
of
the
ground
and
all
the
limbs
cut
off
at
half
their
length
this
will
induce
the
formation
of
a
full
large
head
a
low
head
is
always
best
on
a
is
perhaps
the
most
important
matter
in
successful
peach
culture
the
fruit
is
borne
wholly
on
wood
of
the
previous
growth
hence
a
tree
that
has
the
most
of
that
growth
in
a
mature
state
and
properly
situated
will
bear
the
most
and
the
finest
fruit
a
tree
left
to
its
natural
state
with
no
pruning
but
of
a
few
of
the
lower
limbs
from
the
main
trunk
will
soon
exhibit
a
collection
of
long
naked
limbs
without
foliage
except
near
their
extremities
see
the
cut
overleaf
in
this
case
fruit
will
be
too
thick
on
what
little
bearing
wood
there
is
and
it
should
be
thinned
but
very
few
cultivators
even
attend
to
that
the
fruit
is
consequently
small
and
it
weakens
the
growth
of
the
young
wood
above
for
next
year
fruiting
and
thus
tree
and
fruit
are
perpetually
deteriorating
observe
a
shoot
of
young
peachwood
you
will
see
near
its
base
on
the
middle
there
are
many
and
on
the
top
again
the
tendency
of
sap
is
to
the
extremity
hence
the
upper
will
put
out
at
once
and
for
their
growth
and
the
maturity
of
the
excessive
fruit
on
the
middle
the
power
of
the
sap
is
so
far
exhausted
that
the
at
the
base
do
not
grow
hence
when
the
fruit
is
removed
nothing
is
left
below
the
terminal
shoots
but
a
bare
pole
this
is
the
condition
in
which
we
find
most
for
this
there
is
a
certain
preventive
it
consists
in
shortening
in
by
cutting
off
in
the
month
of
september
from
a
third
to
a
half
of
the
current
season
growth
if
the
top
be
large
cut
off
one
half
the
length
of
the
new
wood
if
it
be
less
vigorous
and
rank
and
you
fear
you
will
not
have
room
for
a
fair
crop
of
peaches
cut
off
but
one
third
this
is
sometimes
recommended
to
be
done
in
the
spring
for
forming
a
head
in
a
young
tree
the
spring
is
better
but
to
mature
the
wood
and
increase
the
quantity
and
improve
the
quality
of
the
fruit
september
is
much
the
best
such
shortening
in
early
in
september
directs
the
sap
to
maturing
the
wood
already
formed
and
developing
instead
of
promoting
the
growth
of
an
undue
quantity
of
young
and
tender
wood
to
be
destroyed
by
the
winter
or
to
hinder
the
growth
of
the
fruit
of
the
next
season
this
process
with
these
young
shoots
is
most
easily
performed
with
pruning
shears
with
wooden
handles
of
a
length
suited
to
the
height
of
the
tree
illustration
neglected
illustration
but
a
work
to
precede
this
annual
is
the
original
formation
of
a
head
to
a
take
a
tree
a
year
old
from
the
bud
and
cut
it
down
to
within
two
and
a
half
feet
from
the
ground
below
that
numerous
strong
shoots
will
come
out
select
three
vigorous
ones
and
let
them
grow
as
they
please
carefully
pinching
off
all
the
rest
in
the
fall
you
will
have
a
tree
of
three
good
strong
branches
in
the
next
spring
cut
off
these
three
branches
one
half
below
these
cuts
branches
will
start
freely
select
one
vigorous
shoot
to
continue
the
limb
and
another
to
form
a
new
branch
check
the
growth
of
the
shoots
below
by
cutting
off
their
ends
but
do
not
rub
them
off
as
they
will
form
fruit
branches
at
the
close
of
the
season
you
will
have
a
tree
with
six
main
branches
and
some
small
ones
for
fruit
on
the
older
wood
repeat
this
process
the
third
year
and
you
have
a
tree
with
twelve
main
branches
and
plenty
smaller
ones
for
fruit
all
these
small
branches
on
the
old
wood
should
be
shortened
in
half
their
length
to
cause
the
near
their
base
to
start
so
as
to
produce
large
numbers
of
young
shoots
continue
this
as
long
as
you
please
and
make
just
as
large
a
head
and
just
such
a
form
as
you
may
wish
being
careful
only
to
control
the
shape
of
the
top
so
as
to
let
the
sun
and
air
freely
into
every
part
trees
thus
trained
may
be
planted
thick
enough
to
allow
four
hundred
to
stand
on
an
acre
and
will
bear
an
abundance
of
the
finest
fruit
and
all
low
enough
to
be
easily
picked
this
method
of
training
is
much
better
than
allowing
the
tree
to
shoot
out
on
all
sides
from
the
ground
in
that
case
the
branches
are
apt
to
split
down
and
perish
this
system
of
freely
every
year
preserves
the
life
and
health
of
the
tree
remarkably
many
of
the
finest
in
france
are
from
thirty
to
sixty
years
old
and
some
a
hundred
we
may
in
this
country
have
live
fifty
years
in
the
most
healthy
bearing
condition
by
trimming
in
this
way
and
carrying
out
fully
this
system
some
have
more
than
a
foot
in
diameter
bearing
the
very
best
of
fruit
it
is
sheer
neglect
that
causes
our
to
perish
after
having
borne
from
three
to
six
years
let
every
man
who
plants
a
remember
that
this
system
of
training
will
make
his
tree
live
long
be
healthy
grow
vigorously
and
bear
abundantly
of
have
been
a
matter
of
much
speculation
the
result
is
that
the
hope
of
the
is
mainly
in
preventives
is
usually
regarded
as
a
disease
imagination
has
invented
many
causes
of
this
evil
some
suppose
it
to
be
produced
by
small
insects
others
that
it
is
in
the
seed
again
it
is
ascribed
to
the
atmosphere
it
has
been
supposed
to
be
propagated
in
many
ways
by
trimming
a
healthy
tree
with
a
knife
that
had
been
used
on
a
diseased
one
by
contagion
in
the
atmostphere
as
the
measles
or
by
impregnation
from
the
pollen
through
the
agency
of
winds
or
bees
by
the
migration
of
small
insects
or
by
planting
diseased
seeds
or
budding
from
diseased
trees
this
great
diversity
of
opinion
leaves
room
to
doubt
whether
the
yellows
in
be
a
disease
at
all
or
only
a
symptom
of
general
decay
the
symptoms
as
given
in
all
the
are
only
such
as
would
be
natural
from
decay
and
death
of
the
tree
from
any
cause
whatever
this
may
result
from
neglect
to
supply
the
soil
with
suitable
manures
and
to
trim
trees
properly
and
especially
from
this
view
of
the
case
is
more
probable
from
the
fact
that
none
pretend
to
have
found
a
remedy
all
advise
to
remove
the
tree
thus
affected
at
once
root
and
branch
we
have
seen
the
following
treatment
of
such
trees
tried
with
marked
success
cut
off
a
large
share
of
the
top
as
when
you
would
renew
an
old
neglected
tree
lay
the
large
roots
bare
making
a
sort
of
basin
around
the
body
of
the
tree
and
pour
in
three
pailfuls
of
water
the
tree
will
start
anew
and
do
well
this
is
an
excellent
application
to
an
old
failing
the
sure
preventive
of
the
yellows
is
planting
seeds
of
healthy
trees
budding
from
the
most
vigorous
well
supplying
appropriate
manures
and
general
good
cultivation
is
another
evil
among
occurring
before
the
leaves
are
fully
grown
and
causing
them
to
fall
off
after
two
or
three
weeks
other
leaves
will
put
out
but
the
fruit
is
destroyed
and
the
general
health
of
the
tree
injured
elliott
says
the
curl
of
the
leaf
is
produced
by
the
punctures
of
small
insects
one
kind
of
curled
leaf
is
but
not
this
but
we
have
no
doubt
that
barry
theory
is
the
correct
one
that
it
is
the
effect
of
sudden
changes
of
the
weather
we
have
noticed
the
curled
leaf
in
orchards
where
the
trees
were
so
close
together
as
to
guard
each
other
on
the
side
where
the
cold
wind
struck
them
we
noticed
they
were
badly
affected
while
on
the
warm
side
and
in
the
centre
where
they
were
protected
by
the
others
they
exhibited
very
few
signs
of
the
curl
in
western
new
york
unusual
cold
east
winds
always
produce
the
curled
leaves
on
trees
much
exposed
hence
the
only
remedy
is
the
best
protection
you
can
give
by
location
is
a
minute
fungus
growing
on
the
ends
of
tender
shoots
of
certain
varieties
checking
their
growth
and
producing
other
bad
effects
syringe
the
trees
with
a
weak
solution
of
nitre
one
ounce
in
a
gallon
of
water
which
will
destroy
the
fungus
and
invigorate
the
tree
has
been
the
great
enemy
of
the
since
about
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
female
insect
that
produces
the
worms
deposites
her
eggs
under
rough
bark
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
this
is
done
mostly
in
july
but
occasionally
from
june
to
october
the
eggs
are
laid
in
small
punctures
and
covered
with
a
greenish
glue
in
a
few
days
they
come
out
a
small
white
worm
and
eat
through
the
bark
where
it
is
tender
just
at
or
a
little
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
eat
under
the
bark
between
that
and
the
wood
and
consuming
a
little
of
each
they
frequently
girdle
the
tree
as
they
grow
larger
they
perforate
the
solid
wood
when
about
a
year
old
they
make
a
cocoon
just
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
change
into
a
chrysalis
state
and
shortly
come
out
a
winged
insect
to
deposite
fresh
eggs
but
the
practical
part
of
all
this
is
the
keep
the
ground
clean
around
the
trees
and
rub
off
frequently
all
the
rough
bark
place
around
each
tree
half
a
peck
of
lime
and
the
borer
will
not
attack
it
this
should
be
placed
there
on
the
first
of
may
and
be
spread
over
the
ground
on
the
first
of
october
refuse
from
the
or
any
other
offensive
substance
as
salt
and
ashes
will
answer
the
same
purpose
we
should
recommend
the
annual
cultivation
of
a
small
piece
of
ground
in
tobacco
for
use
around
we
have
found
it
very
successful
against
the
borer
and
it
is
an
excellent
manure
applied
two
or
three
times
during
the
season
it
proves
a
perfect
remedy
and
is
in
no
way
injurious
as
an
excessive
quantity
of
lime
might
be
there
are
several
varieties
which
cause
the
leaves
to
curl
and
prematurely
fall
this
kind
of
curled
leaf
differs
from
the
one
described
as
the
result
of
sudden
changes
and
cold
wind
that
appears
general
wherever
the
cold
wind
strikes
the
tree
while
this
only
affects
a
few
leaves
occasionally
and
those
surrounded
by
healthy
leaves
the
remedy
is
to
syringe
them
with
offensive
mixtures
as
or
sprinkle
them
when
wet
with

his

the

quite
as

induced

to
the
great
injury
of

nearly
unanimous
in
discarding

as
stocks
for

the
difficulty
in
raising
seedling
is
the
failure
of
the

a
remedy
for
this
is
never

allow

plant
as
soon
as
taken
from

the

is
the
best
time
for
planting

more

the

will
succeed
well

do

be
utterly
discarded
for
producing

and
are
recommended
setting
out
properly
is
of
very
great
importance
the
requisites
are
to
have
the
ground
in
good
condition
from
manure
on
the
crop
of
the
last
season
and
thoroughly
subsoiled
and

in

heavy
land

it
be
well

standing
in

soil
about
them
is
utterly
ruinous
well
transplanted
on
moderately
rich
land
well
subsoiled
and
well
drained
will
almost
always
succeed
by
observing
the
following
brief
directions
any
cultivator
may
have
just
such
shaped
tops
on
his
as
he
desires
cut
short
any
shoots
that
are
too
vigorous
that
those
around
them
may
get
their
share
of
the
sap
and
thus
be
enabled
to
make
a
proportionate
growth
after
trees
have
come
into
bearing
symmetry
in
the
form
of
their
heads
may
be
promoted
by
pinching
off
all
the
fruit
on
the
weak
branches
and
allowing
all
on
the
strong
ones
to
mature
those
two
simple
methods
removing
the
fruit
from
too
vigorous
shoots
and
cutting
in
others
half
or
their
length
will
enable
one
to
form
just
such
heads
as
he
pleases
and
will
prove
the
best
preventives
of
diseases
there
are
many
insects
that
infest
in
the
same
manner
as
they
do
apples
and
are
to
be
destroyed
in
the
same
way
the
slugs
on
the
leaves
are
often
quite
annoying
these
are
worms
nearly
half
an
inch
long
and
tapering
from
head
to
tail
like
a
tadpole
ashes
or
quicklime
sprinkled
over
the
leaves
when
they
are
wet
with
dew
or
rain
is
an
effectual
remedy
this
has
been
confounded
with
the
blight
though
they
are
very
different
in
early
summer
when
the
shoots
are
in
most
vigorous
growth
you
will
notice
that
the
leaves
on
the
ends
of
branches
turn
brown
and
very
soon
die
and
become
black
this
is
caused
by
a
worm
from
an
egg
deposited
just
behind
or
below
a
bud
by
an
insect
the
egg
hatches
and
the
worm
perforates
the
bark
into
the
wood
and
commits
his
depredations
there
preventing
the
healthy
flow
of
the
sap
which
kills
the
twig
above
soon
after
the
shoot
dies
the
worm
comes
out
in
the
form
of
a
winged
insect
and
seeks
a
location
to
deposite
its
eggs
preparatory
to
new
depredations
the
remedy
is
to
cut
off
the
shoots
affected
at
once
and
burn
them
the
does
not
affect
the
tree
far
below
the
location
of
the
worm
watch
your
trees
closely
and
cut
off
all
affected
parts
as
soon
as
they
appear
and
burn
them
immediately
and
you
will
soon
destroy
all
the
insects
but
very
soon
after
the
appearance
of
the
blight
they
leave
the
limb
hence
a
little
delay
will
render
your
efforts
useless
these
insects
often
commit
the
same
depredations
on
apple
and
we
had
an
orchard
in
ohio
seriously
affected
by
them
we
know
no
remedy
but
destruction
as
above
is
a
much
more
serious
difficulty
its
nature
and
origin
are
now
pretty
well
settled
in
every
tree
there
are
two
currents
of
sap
one
passes
up
through
the
outer
wood
to
be
digested
by
the
leaves
the
other
passing
down
in
the
inner
bark
deposites
new
wood
to
increase
the
size
of
the
tree
now
in
a
late
growth
of
this
kind
of
wood
the
process
is
rapidly
going
on
at
the
approach
of
cold
weather
and
the
descending
sap
is
suddenly
frozen
in
this
tender
bark
and
growing
wood
this
sudden
freezing
poisons
the
sap
and
renders
the
tree
diseased
the
blight
will
show
itself
in
its
worst
form
in
the
most
rapid
growing
season
of
early
summer
though
the
disease
commenced
with
the
severe
frosts
of
the
previous
autumn
its
presence
may
be
known
by
a
thick
clammy
sap
that
will
exude
in
winter
or
spring
pruning
and
in
the
discoloration
of
the
inner
bark
and
peth
of
the
branches
on
limbs
badly
affected
on
one
side
the
bark
will
turn
black
and
shrivel
up
but
its
effects
in
the
death
of
the
branches
only
occur
when
the
growth
of
the
tree
demands
the
rapid
descent
of
the
sap
then
the
poisoned
sap
which
was
arrested
the
previous
fall
in
its
downward
passage
is
diluted
and
sent
through
the
tree
and
when
it
is
abundant
the
whole
tree
is
poisoned
and
destroyed
in
a
few
days
in
others
more
slightly
affected
it
only
destroys
a
limb
or
a
small
portion
of
the
top
another
effect
of
this
of
sap
and
growing
wood
is
to
rupture
the
and
thus
prevent
the
inner
bark
from
performing
its
functions
this
theory
is
so
well
established
that
an
intelligent
observer
can
predict
in
the
fall
a
the
following
summer
if
the
summer
be
cool
and
the
fall
warm
and
damp
closed
by
sudden
cold
the
blight
will
be
troublesome
the
next
season
because
the
plentiful
downward
flow
of
sap
and
rapid
growth
of
wood
were
arrested
by
sudden
freezing
if
the
summer
is
favorable
and
the
wood
matures
well
before
cold
weather
the
blight
will
not
appear
this
is
of
the
utmost
practical
moment
to
the
anything
in
soil
situation
or
pruning
that
favors
early
maturity
of
wood
will
serve
as
a
preventive
of
blight
hence
cool
moist
situations
are
not
favorable
in
climates
subject
to
sudden
and
severe
cold
weather
in
autumn
and
which
always
induce
early
maturity
of
wood
are
of
vast
importance
they
will
almost
always
prevent
blight
if
in
spite
of
you
your
will
make
a
late
luxuriant
growth
cut
off
one
half
of
the
most
vigorous
shoots
before
hard
freezing
and
you
will
check
the
flow
of
sap
by
removing
the
leaves
and
shoots
that
control
it
and
save
your
trees
if
blight
makes
its
appearance
cut
off
at
once
all
the
parts
affected
the
effects
will
be
visible
in
the
wood
and
inner
bark
far
below
the
external
apparent
injury
remove
the
whole
injured
part
or
it
will
poison
the
rest
of
the
tree
when
this
frozen
sap
is
extensive
it
poisons
and
destroys
the
whole
tree
when
slight
the
tree
often
wholly
recovers
if
a
spot
of
black
shrivelled
bark
appears
shave
it
off
deep
enough
to
remove
the
affected
parts
and
cover
the
wound
with
remove
all
affected
limbs
these
are
the
only
remedies
but
the
practice
of
pruning
both
roots
and
branches
will
prove
a
certain
preventive
a
tree
growing
in
grass
where
it
grows
more
slowly
and
matures
earlier
in
the
season
will
escape
this
blight
while
one
growing
in
very
rich
garden
soil
and
continuing
to
grow
until
cold
weather
will
suffer
severely
the
effects
on
orchards
in
different
soils
and
localities
everywhere
confirm
this
theory
a
little
care
then
will
prevent
this
evil
which
has
sometimes
been
so
great
as
to
discourage
attempts
at
raising
pears
in
some
localities
some
of
the
finer
varieties
of
pears
as
the
virgalieu
are
ruined
by
cracking
on
the
trees
before
ripening
applications
of
ashes
salt
charcoal
and
clay
on
light
lands
will
remedy
this
evil
all
had
better
occupy
as
little
ground
as
is
consistent
with
a
healthy
vigorous
growth
they
are
manured
and
well
cultivated
at
a
much
less
expense
the
trees
protect
each
other
against
inclement
weather
the
fruit
is
more
easily
harvested
and
it
is
a
great
saving
of
land
as
nothing
else
can
be
profitably
grown
in
an
orchard
of
large
the
two
kinds
of
dwarf
and
standard
may
be
planted
together
closely
and
be
profitable
for
early
and
abundant
bearing
the
plan
given
on
the
next
page
of
a
recommended
in
cole
fruit
book
is
the
best
we
have
seen
in
the
plan
the
trees
on
designed
for
standards
occupy
the
large
black
spots
where
the
lines
intersect
they
are
feet
apart
the
small
spots
indicate
the
position
of
on
quince
stocks
of
these
there
are
three
on
each
square
rod
an
acre
then
would
have
forty
standard
trees
and
four
hundred
and
eighty
dwarfs
the
latter
will
come
into
early
bearing
and
be
profitable
long
before
the
former
will
produce
any
fruit
this
will
induce
and
repay
thorough
cultivation
they
should
be
headed
in
and
finally
removed
as
the
standards
need
more
room
one
acre
carefully
cultivated
in
this
way
will
afford
an
income
sufficient
for

the

is

some
of

as
possible
excluded
from

ones

plowing
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
matters
in
when
how
and
how
much
shall
we
plow
are
the
three
questions
involving
the
whole
when
should
plowing
be
done
as
it
respects
wet
or
dry
plow
sandy
or
gravelly
land
whenever
you
are
ready
it
will
neither
be
hard
when
dry
nor
injured
by
being
plowed
when
very
wet
good
loams
may
be
plowed
at
all
times
except
when
excessively
wet
clays
can
only
be
worked
profitably
when
neither
excessively
wet
or
dry
plowing
land
in
a
warm
rain
is
almost
equal
to
a
coat
of
manure
plowing
in
a
light
snow
in
the
spring
will
injure
it
the
whole
season
we
have
noticed
a
marked
difference
in
corn
growing
but
a
rod
apart
on
land
where
snow
was
plowed
in
and
the
other
plowed
two
or
three
days
later
after
the
snow
was
gone
this
difference
was
noticeable
in
the
rows
throughout
the
entire
field
spring
or
fall
plowing
is
a
question
that
has
been
much
discussed
is
better
plowed
in
the
fall
the
action
of
winter
rains
and
frosts
on
the
turf
is
beneficial
the
same
is
true
of
land
trenched
deep
where
much
of
the
hard
poor
subsoil
is
brought
to
the
surface
it
is
benefited
by
winter
exposure
other
cultivated
fields
are
injured
by
unless
it
be
very
early
all
is
much
benefited
by
being
plowed
as
soon
as
the
grain
is
taken
off
the
weeds
and
stubble
plowed
under
will
be
decomposed
by
the
warm
weather
and
rains
and
benefit
the
soil
almost
as
much
as
an
ordinary
coat
of
manure
plowed
late
such
action
does
not
take
place
and
the
surface
is
injured
by
hence
do
all
the
possible
but
plow
nothing
in
the
fall
but
how
shall
we
plow
all
land
should
be
subsoiled
except
that
having
a
light
porous
subsoil
one
deep
plowing
on
such
land
is
sufficient
subsoiling
is
done
by
using
two
teams
at
once
one
with
a
common
plow
running
deep
and
the
other
with
a
with
no
and
which
will
consequently
stir
and
disintegrate
the
earth
to
the
depth
at
which
it
runs
without
throwing
it
to
the
surface
the
next
will
cover
up
this
loosened
subsoil
in
this
way
land
may
be
plowed
eighteen
inches
deep
to
the
great
benefit
of
any
crop
grown
on
it
if
the
surface
be
well
manured
this
method
of
plowing
will
place
the
manure
between
the
first
furrow
and
the
subsoil
and
increase
its
value
such
plowing
is
very
valuable
on
land
for
young
there
is
another
method
which
we
denominate
which
is
more
beneficial
than
ordinary
subsoiling
it
is
performed
by
two
common
plows
one
following
in
the
furrow
of
the
other
the
first
furrow
need
not
be
very
deep
let
the
furrow
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
be
as
deep
as
possible
and
thrown
out
upon
the
surface
the
next
furrow
will
throw
the
surface
and
manure
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
furrow
the
next
furrow
will
cover
this
and
manure
very
deep
and
as
manure
always
works
up
it
will
impregnate
the
whole
this
for
berries
nurseries
or
young
orchards
is
the
best
form
of
plowing
that
we
have
ever
tried
it
may
be
done
with
one
team
by
simply
changing
the
gauge
of
the
clevis
every
time
round
gauging
it
light
for
the
first
furrow
and
deep
for
the
second
we
once
prepared
a
plat
in
this
way
with
one
team
on
which
cabbages
made
a
remarkable
growth
even
in
a
dry
season
still
a
farther
improvement
would
be
a
light
coat
of
fine
manure
on
the
surface
all
furrows
in
every
description
of
plowing
should
be
near
enough
together
to
move
the
whole
leaving
no
hard
places
between
them
the
usual
cut
and
cover
system
to
get
over
a
large
area
in
a
day
is
miserable
economy
the
more
evenly
and
flatly
land
can
be
turned
over
in
plowing
the
better
it
will
be
it
retards
the
growth
of
weeds
and
secures
a
better
action
upon
substances
plowed
under
an
exception
to
deep
plowing
is
in
breaking
up
the
original
prairies
of
the
west
they
have
to
be
broken
with
plows
kept
sharp
as
a
knife
and
not
more
than
two
inches
deep
the
grass
then
dies
and
the
sod
rots
but
plowed
deep
the
grass
comes
up
through
the
turf
and
will
prove
troublesome
for
two
or
three
years
it
must
also
be
broken
at
a
certain
season
of
the
year
to
insure
success
it
may
be
profitably
done
for
two
months
after
the
grass
gets
a
good
start
in
the
spring
is
it
best
to
plow
land
once
or
thoroughly
subsoiled
and
well
turned
over
is
better
than
more
land
once
plowed
so
as
to
disintegrate
the
whole
to
the
depth
of
the
furrow
will
produce
more
and
require
less
care
than
the
same
would
do
if
once
or
twice
excessive
plowing
is
a
positive
injury
all
land
should
be
broken
up
once
in
three
or
four
years
and
not
kept
longer
than
that
under
the
plow
at
one
time
some
farmers
keep
land
perpetually
in
grass
refusing
to
have
a
plow
touch
it
on
any
condition
they
see
wrong
tillage
produce
barrenness
but
by
this
practice
they
are
great
losers
they
never
get
over
one
half
the
hay
or
pasturage
that
could
be
obtained
by
frequent
tillage
and
manuring
and
a
rotation
of
crops
plum
this
is
one
of
our
best
fruits
but
suffers
more
from
enemies
than
any
other
is
by
seeds
or
layers
budding
or
grafting
seeds
from
trees
not
exposed
to
mixture
with
other
varieties
in
the
blossom
will
produce
the
same
hence
this
is
the
best
method
of
propagating
a
given
variety
standing
alone
but
for
most
situations
budding
is
preferable
to
any
other
method
this
should
be
performed
earlier
than
on
the
peach
the
plum
matures
earlier
and
hence
should
be
budded
about
the
last
of
july
or
first
of
august
bud
on
the
north
side
of
the
tree
to
avoid
the
hot
sun
and
tie
more
tightly
than
in
budding
other
trees
bud
the
second
year
from
the
seed
grafting
should
be
resorted
to
only
when
buds
have
failed
and
there
is
a
prospect
that
the
trees
will
be
too
large
for
budding
another
season
the
common
wild
plums
make
good
stocks
if
grafted
at
the
ground
thoroughly
mulch
all
will
succeed
but
should
never
be
practised
in
all
grafting
of
plums
put
the
graft
in
at
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
cover
with
sawdust
or
mould
leaving
but
one
bud
on
the
graft
exposed
all
soils
are
good
for
the
plum
provided
they
be
thoroughly
drained
and
properly
fertilized
hard
soils
are
recommended
as
being
almost
proof
against
the
curculio
that
a
soil
affording
a
rather
hard
smooth
surface
will
afford
less
burrows
for
curculio
and
consequently
lessen
their
ravages
is
no
doubt
true
but
it
is
not
a
perfect
remedy
and
on
other
accounts
such
a
soil
is
no
better
a
good
firm
loam
is
best
plums
will
do
well
also
on
light
land
but
are
more
exposed
to
injury
from
the
curculio
the
plum
being
perfectly
hardy
we
recommend
transplanting
in
autumn
shorten
in
the
top
cut
off
considerable
of
the
and
the
ends
of
the
long
roots
transplant
well
and
mulch
so
thoroughly
as
to
prevent
too
strong
action
of
the
frost
on
the
roots
and
they
will
start
early
and
do
well
twelve
feet
apart
for
small
varieties
and
twenty
feet
for
larger
growers
are
the
distances
usually
recommended
we
think
a
rod
apart
each
way
will
do
well
for
all
varieties
once
started
in
a
regular
growth
in
such
a
shape
as
you
desire
no
further
pruning
will
be
necessary
but
occasionally
a
too
luxuriant
shoot
and
removing
diseased
and
cross
limbs
on
rich
western
lands
and
in
warm
southern
climes
young
must
be
and
or
they
will
be
unfruitful
and
unhealthy
should
be
done
in
august
in
the
following
manner
in
case
of
a
tree
ten
feet
high
take
a
sharp
spade
and
in
a
circle
around
the
tree
two
feet
from
the
trunk
making
the
circle
four
feet
in
diameter
cut
off
all
the
roots
within
reach
in
smaller
trees
make
the
circle
smaller
and
in
larger
ones
larger
at
the
same
time
shorten
in
the
current
year
growth
by
cutting
off
one
half
the
length
of
all
the
principal
shoots
this
will
give
vigor
symmetry
and
fruitfulness
and
prove
a
valuable
preventive
of
disease

always
have

cultivation
from

and
with

and

of

the

this

the
most
valuable
of
all
esculent
roots
supposed
to
be
a
native
of
south
america
it
is
called
the
irish
potato
because
it
was
grown
extensively
first
in
ireland
it
was
first
planted
on
the
estate
of
sir
walter
raleigh
in
it
was
introduced
into
england
in
it
has
been
represented
as
having
been
introduced
into
england
from
virginia
as
early
as
but
attracted
no
attention
and
for
two
centuries
formed
no
considerable
part
of
british
agriculture
it
has
become
naturalized
in
all
temperate
regions
and
in
many
locations
in
high
latitudes
in
tropical
climates
it
flourishes
on
the
mountains
at
an
elevation
sufficient
to
secure
a
cool
atmosphere
cool
moist
regions
as
ireland
and
the
northern
parts
of
the
united
states
are
most
favorable
for
potatoes
in
warm
climates
the
potato
grows
less
luxuriantly
yields
much
less
and
is
liable
to
be
ruined
by
a
second
growth
in
the
latitude
of
southern
ohio
a
severe
drought
while
the
tubers
are
small
followed
by
considerable
rain
causes
the
young
potatoes
to
sprout
and
send
up
fresh
shoots
and
often
make
a
very
luxuriant
growth
of
tops
to
the
complete
ruin
of
the
tubers
this
is
called
second
growth
in
cooler
climates
this
second
growth
simply
makes
prongs
on
the
tubers
thus
injuring
the
appearance
and
quality
but
increasing
the
crop
the
only
preventive
is
watering
regularly
in
a
dry
time
this
can
be
done
advantageously
in
a
garden

on

small

by
annually
planting

ever
takes
place
from

this
can
only
be
done
in

consequently
appear
in

always
plant
ripe

them
whole
selecting
small
potatoes
for
seed
and
cutting
them
up
and
planting
mere
eyes
and
pearings
as
some
do
has
done
much
to
injure
the
health

the

left

in

probably
our

varieties
had
such
an
origin
raising
new
varieties
requires
much
care
and
patience
keep
each
one
separate
plant
only
the
best
and
then
you
must
wait
four
or
five
years
to
determine
whether
out
of
a
thousand
you
have
one
good
variety
these
are
numerous
those
best
adapted
to
one
locality
are
often
inferior
in
another
that
excellent
potato
the
carter
so
firm
in

inferior
in

the
neshannock
or
common
mercer
produces
a
larger
yield
in
illinois
than
in
the
eastern
states
but
of
a
slightly
inferior
quality
most
seeds
do
better
transported
from
a
colder
to
a
warmer
climate
but
with
the
potato
the
reverse
is
true
the
best
potatoes
of
ireland
are
usually
inferior
in
the
warmer
latitudes
of
this
country
in
ordering
potatoes
for
seed
it
is
better
to
describe
the
quality
than
to
order
by
the
name
we
omit
any
list
of
even
the
best
varieties
they
are
known
by
different
names
and
are
not
equally
good
in
all
localities
and
all
varieties
are
scattered
over
the
whole
country
very
soon
by
dealers
and
through
the
agency
of
agricultural
societies
and
periodicals
different
varieties
should
be
kept
separate
as
they
look
better
for
market
and
no
two
will
cook
in
precisely
the
same
time
the
large
potatoes
and
plant
them
from
a
small
eye
or
a
small
potato
to
the
largest
they
will
vegetate
equally
well
and
in
a
wet
cool
season
the
small
seed
will
produce
nearly
as
good
a
crop
as
the
large
but
the
large
seed
matures
earlier
and
in
a
dry
season
produces
a
much
larger
crop
the
moisture
in
a
large
potato
decaying
in
the
hill
is
of
great
use
to
the
growing
plants
in
a
dry
season
it
is
also
generally
conceded
that
potatoes
growing
from
cut
seed
are
more
liable
to
be
affected
by
the
rot
of
seed
per
the
practices
of
farmers
vary
from
five
to
twenty
bushels
it
takes
a
less
number
of
bushels
per
acre
when
the
seed
is
cut
the
quantity
is
also
affected
by
the
size
of
the
seed
the
larger
the
potatoes
the
more
will
it
take
to
seed
an
acre
plentiful
but
not
excessive
seeding
is
best
it
is
a
universal
fact
that
you
can
never
get
something
for
nothing
hence
light
seeding
will
bring
a
light
yield
we
think
it
best
to
put
one
potato
in
a
place
and
make
the
rows
three
feet
apart
each
way
we
think
they
yield
better
than
at
any
other
distances
or
in
any
other
way
we
have
often
tried
drills
and
found
them
more
trouble
with
no
greater
yield
the
soil
should
be
disintegrated
to
the
depth
of
sixteen
inches
and
the
potatoes
planted
four
inches
deep
and
cultivated
with
subsoil
plow
and
other
suitable
tools
in
a
manner
to
leave
the
surface
nearly
flat
hilling
up
potatoes
never
does
any
good
we
advise
always
to
harrow
the
crop
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
appear
through
the
soil
any
good
rich
garden
soil
is
good
for
this
crop
provided
it
be
well
drained
potatoes
like
moisture
but
are
ruined
by
having
water
stand
in
the
soil
new
land
and
newly
old
pastures
are
best
all
the
usual
fertilizers
are
good
for
potatoes
but
especially
ashes
and
plaster
the
application
above
all
others
for
potatoes
is
potash
dissolve
it
in
water
making
it
quite
weak
and
saturate
your
other
manures
with
it
and
the
effect
will
always
be
marked
the
tops
contain
a
great
deal
of
potash
and
should
always
be
plowed
in
and
decay
in
the
soil
where
they
grow
otherwise
they
will
rapidly
exhaust
the
land
it
is
supposed
that
nothing
will
do
more
to
restore
the
former
vigor
and
health
of
the
potato
than
a
liberal
application
of
potash
in
the
soil
in
which
they
grow
the
crop
will
be
much
increased
in
a
dry
season
by
manuring
in
the
hill
dropping
the
potato
first
and
putting
the
manure
on
the
top
of
it
and
the
usual
with
hoe
or
are
well
known
and
do
well
when
the
crop
is
not
large
but
for
those
who
grow
potatoes
for
market
it
is
better
to
employ
the
plow
in
digging
modern
inventions
for
this
purpose
can
everywhere
be
found
in
the
agricultural
warehouses
potatoes
are
well
preserved
in
a
good
cool
cellar
in
boxes
or
barrels
and
are
better
for
being
covered
with
moist
sand
the
usual
method
of
burying
them
outdoor
is
effectual
and
safe
if
they
be
covered
beyond
the
reach
of
frost
and
have
a
small
airhole
at
the
apex
filled
with
straw
potato
this
is
altogether
atmospherical
a
new
piece
of
land
was
cleared
for
potatoes
in
the
middle
was
a
close
muck
on
a
coarse
gravelly
subsoil
in
the
lowest
place
a
ditch
was
dug
to
carry
off
the
superabundance
of
water
from
that
ditch
the
coarse
gravel
was
thrown
out
on
one
side
and
suffered
to
remain
at
considerable
depth
only
two
or
three
rods
distant
on
one
side
the
plat
extended
over
a
knoll
of
loose
sand
potatoes
were
planted
from
the
same
seed
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
manner
on
these
three
kinds
of
land
side
by
side
they
were
all
tended
alike
needing
little
hoeing
or
care
the
land
being
new
the
rot
prevailed
badly
that
season
on
digging
the
potatoes
it
was
found
that
in
the
coarse
gravel
where
the
air
could
circulate
almost
as
freely
as
in
a
pile
of
all
the
potatoes
were
rotten
on
the
muck
which
was
unlike
a
very
fine
and
tight
almost
impervious
to
the
atmosphere
they
were
nearly
all
sound
on
the
sand
which
was
quite
open
but
tighter
than
the
gravel
part
were
decayed
and
the
rest
sound
their
condition
was
graduated
entirely
by
the
condition
of
the
soil
it
is
an
apparent
objection
to
this
theory
that
when
the
rot
prevails
the
best
potatoes
are
raised
on
light
sandy
soils
it
is
said
that
they
are
open
to
the
action
of
air
to
this
it
is
replied
that
whether
they
rot
or
not
in
sandy
soils
depends
on
the
kind
of
sand
on
some
sand
they
rot
very
badly
on
others
hardly
at
all
sandy
soils
differ
very
materially
some
are
almost
pure
silex
while
others
are
filled
with
a
fine
dust
and
although
apparently
loose
are
much
more
nearly
impervious
to
the
air
than
heavier
soils
on
the
former
nearly
all
will
decay
and
on
the
latter
most
will
be
preserved
look
at
the
immense
potato
crops
near
rochester
on
sandy
land
we
have
personally
examined
it
and
find
it
to
be
filled
with
dust
that
excludes
the
air
and
saves
the
potato
from
rot
why
then
is
a
heavy
clay
useless
for
potatoes
is
not
clay
a
very
tight
soil
unbroken
it
is
but
when
plowed
it
is
always
left
in
larger
particles
than
other
land
it
is
but
seldom
pulverized
the
spaces
between
the
particles
are
all
open
to
the
free
action
of
the
air
hence
instead
of
being
close
it
is
one
of
the
most
open
of
all
our
soils
this
confirms
the
theory
the
influence
of
manuring
land
is
still
another
confirmation
we
are
directed
not
to
manure
our
land
for
potatoes
when
the
disease
prevails
it
is
said
we
can
raise
no
sound
potatoes
on
rich
land
when
the
rot
is
abroad
this
is
an
error
the
richness
of
the
soil
does
not
promote
the
disease
but
if
any
kind
of
manure
be
applied
that
from
its
bulk
and
coarseness
keeps
the
soil
open
to
the
air
the
potatoes
will
rot
but
fertilize
to
the
highest
extent
in
any
way
that
does
not
make
the
soil
too
open
and
let
in
the
air
and
the
crop
will
be
greatly
increased
with
perfect
safety
thus
this
theory
like
every
truth
perfectly
fits
in
all
its
bearings
there
is
then
no
perfect
remedy
for
the
disease
but
in
the
power
of
him
who
can
purify
the
atmosphere
numerous
remedies
and
preventives
have
been
recommended
by
those
who
suppose
they
have
tried
them
with
success
but
in
other
localities
and
soils
all
their
remedies
have
failed
as
will
all
others
that
will
yet
be
discovered
a
careful
examination
of
the
texture
of
the
soils
upon
the
principles
here
indicated
and
a
repetition
of
their
experiments
will
show
the
discoverers
that
their
success
depended
upon
their
soils
while
others
failed
in
using
the
same
remedies
on
other
soils
the
practical
uses
of
this
theory
are
obvious
when
the
disease
is
abroad
we
should
select
soil
that
excludes
as
much
as
possible
the
atmosphere
and
plant
on
all
land
not
liable
to
have
water
stand
on
the
subsoil
do
not
be
deceived
into
the
belief
that
all
sandy
land
will
bear
good
potatoes
in
the
seasons
when
the
disease
prevails
the
worst
rot
we
ever
had
was
in
on
very
sandy
land
this
year
we
have
witnessed
the
worst
rot
in
open
sand
and
gravel
add
to
this
great
care
in
preserving
the
health
of
the
tubers
plant
very
early
only
whole
potatoes
and
of
mature
growth
thoroughly
ripe
apply
a
little
salt
and
lime
plaster
rather
plentifully
and
potash
or
plenty
of
and
you
will
succeed
in
the
worst
of
seasons
preserving
fruits
the
essentials
in
preserving
fruits
berries
and
vegetables
during
the
whole
year
are
a
total
exclusion
from
atmospheric
action
and
in
some
vegetables
a
strong
action
of
heat
we
have
a
variety
of
patent
cans
and
several
processes
are
recommended
the
patent
cans
serve
a
good
purpose
but
for
general
use
are
inferior
to
those
ordinarily
made
by
the
tinman
the
patent
articles
are
only
good
for
one
year
and
are
used
with
greater
difficulty
by
the
unskilful
the
ordinary
tin
cans
made
in
the
form
of
a
cylinder
with
an
orifice
in
the
top
large
enough
to
admit
whatever
you
would
preserve
will
last
ten
years
with
careful
usage
and
they
are
so
simple
that
no
mistakes
need
be
made
it
is
usually
recommended
to
solder
on
the
cover
which
is
simply
a
square
piece
of
tin
large
enough
to
cover
the
orifice
soldering
may
be
best
for
those
cans
that
are
to
be
transported
a
long
distance
but
it
is
troublesome
and
is
entirely
unnecessary
for
domestic
use
a
little
which
any
apothecary
can
make
at
a
cheap
rate
laid
on
the
top
of
the
can
when
hot
will
melt
and
the
cover
placed
upon
it
will
adhere
and
cause
it
to
be
all
articles
that
do
not
part
with
their
aroma
by
being
cooked
may
be
perfectly
preserved
in
such
cans
by
putting
them
in
when
boiling
seasoned
to
your
taste
and
putting
on
the
covers
at
once
the
cans
should
be
full
and
set
in
a
cool
place
and
the
articles
will
remain
in
a
perfect
state
for
a
year
the
finest
articles
of
fruit
as
peaches
and
strawberries
may
be
preserved
so
as
to
retain
all
their
peculiar
aroma
by
putting
them
into
such
cans
filled
with
a
sirup
of
pure
sugar
and
placing
the
cans
so
filled
in
a
kettle
of
water
and
raising
it
to
a
boiling
heat
and
then
putting
on
the
cover
as
above
the
heat
expels
the
air
and
the
cover
and
wax
keep
it
out
stone
jugs
are
used
for
the
same
purposes
but
are
not
sufficiently
tight
to
keep
out
the
air
unless
well
painted
after
having
become
cold
glass
bottles
are
excellent
but
in
using
glass
or
stone
ware
the
corks
must
be
put
in
and
tied
at
the
commencement
leaving
a
small
aperture
for
the
escape
of
steam
and
the
process
of
raising
the
water
to
a
boiling
heat
must
be
gradual
requiring
three
or
four
hours
or
the
bottles
will
be
broken
by
sudden
expansion
make
the
corks
by
covering
with
on
taking
from
the
boiling
water
some
vegetables
as
peas
beans
cauliflowers
need
considerable
boiling
in
order
to
perfect
preservation
tin
cans
may
stand
in
the
water
and
boil
an
hour
or
two
if
you
choose
and
then
be
sealed
the
bottles
should
be
corked
tight
have
the
cork
tied
in
and
then
be
immersed
and
boil
for
an
hour
take
them
out
and
dip
the
cork
and

of
the
bottles
in
and
all
will
be
safe
by
one
of
these
processes
exclusion
of
the
atmosphere
and
thorough
boiling
we
may
preserve
any
fruit
or
vegetable
so
as
to
have
an
abundance
nearly
as
good
as
the
fresh
in
its
season
the
whole
year
and
that
at
a
trifling
expense
all
fruits
and
vegetables
may
also
be
preserved
by
drying
by
being
properly
dried
the
original
aroma
can
be
mostly
retained
the
essentials
in
properly
drying
are
artificial
heat
and
free
circulation
of
the
air
about
the
drying
articles
fruit
dried
in
the
sun
is
not
nearly
so
fine
as
that
dried
by
artificial
heat
an
oven
from
which
bread
has
just
been
taken
is
suitable
for
this
purpose
but
a
is
better
a
tight
room
with
a
stove
in
the
bottom
and
the
fruit
in
shallow
drawers
put
in
from
the
outside
serves
a
good
purpose
construct
the
room
so
as
to
give
a
draft
the
heated
air
passing
out
at
the
top
and
the
process
of
drying
will
be
greatly
facilitated
and
the
more
rapid
the
process
without
cooking
the
fruit
the
better
will
be
its
quality
this
process
is
applicable
to
all
kinds
of
vegetables
roots
as
beets
carrots
parsnips
or
potatoes
should
be
sliced
before
drying
the
object
in
drying
the
latter
articles
would
be
to
afford
the
luxury
of
good
vegetables
for
armies
and
ships
crews
in
distant
regions
and
in
climates
where
they
are
not
grown
milk
can
be
condensed
and
preserved
for
a
long
time
and
being
greatly
reduced
in
quantity
it
is
easily
transported
it
is
not
generally
known
in
the
country
that
gail
borden
of
new
york
has
invented
a
method
of
condensing
milk
fresh
from
the
cow
so
that
it
will
perfectly
retain
all
its
excellences
including
the
cream
and
by
being
sealed
up
in
tin
cans
as
above
may
be
kept
for
many
months
the
milk
and
the
process
of
condensation
have
been
scientifically
examined
by
the
new
york
academy
of
medicine
and
pronounced
perfect
and
of
great
value
to
the
world
we
have
used
the
condensed
milk
which
was
more
than
a
month
old
it
had
been
kept
in
a
tin
can
without
sealing
and
without
ice
but
in
a
cool
place
it
was
sweet
and
good
differing
in
no
respect
from
fresh
milk
from
the
cow
except
that
the
heat
employed
in
condensing
it
gave
it
the
taste
of
boiled
milk
if
kept
in
a
warm
place
and
exposed
to
the
atmosphere
it
may
sour
nearly
as
soon
as
other
milk
but
it
may
be
sealed
up
and
kept
cool
so
as
to
be
good
for
a
long
time
the
condensation
is
accomplished
by
simple
evaporation
of
the
watery
part
in
pans
in
vacuo
no
substance
whatever
is
put
into
the
milk
four
gallons
of
fresh
milk
are
condensed
into
one
when
wanted
for
use
the
quantity
desired
is
put
into
twice
the
quantity
of
water
which
makes
good
cream
for
coffee
or
one
part
to
four
of
water
makes
good
new
milk
and
one
part
to
five
or
six
makes
a
better
milk
than
that
usually
sold
in
cities
steamers
now
lay
in
a
supply
for
a
voyage
to
liverpool
and
return
and
on
arrival
in
new
york
the
milk
is
as
good
as
when
taken
on
board
the
advantages
will
be
numerous
such
milk
will
be
among
regular
supplies
for
armies
and
navies
and
for
all
shipping
to
distant
countries
all
cities
and
villages
may
have
pure
cheap
milk
as
the
condensation
will
render
transportation
so
cheap
that
milk
can
be
sent
from
any
part
of
the
country
where
it
is
most
plenty
and
cheapest
the
process
is
patented
but
will
be
granted
to
others
at
reasonable
rates
by
borden
and
eventually
it
will
become
general
when
farmers
can
condense
and
lay
by
in
the
season
when
it
is
abundant
milk
for
use
in
the
winter
when
cows
are
dry
this
will
make
milk
abundant
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
plenty
wherever
we
choose
to
carry
it
it
will
also
save
the
lives
of
thousands
of
children
in
cities
that
are
fed
on
unwholesome
milk
or
poisonous
mixtures
there
is
no
temptation
to
adulterate
such
milk
for
the
process
of
condensation
is
cheaper
than
any
mixture
that
could
be
passed
preserving
hams
is
effectually
done
by
either
of
the
following
methods
after
well
curing
and
smoking
sew
them
up
in
a
bag
of
cotton
cloth
fitting
closely
and
dip
them
into
a
tub
of
nearly
as
thick
as
cream
and
hang
up
in
a
cool
room
this
is
a
good
method
though
they
will
sometimes
mould
the
other
process
and
the
one
we
most
recommend
is
to
put
well
cured
and
smoked
hams
in
a
cask
or
box
with
very
fine
charcoal
put
in
a
layer
of
charcoal
and
then
one
of
hams
cover
with
another
layer
of
coal
and
then
of
hams
and
so
on
until
the
cask
is
full
or
all
your
hams
are
deposited
no
mould
will
appear
and
no
insect
will
touch
them
this
method
is
perfect
another
process
involving
the
same
principles
as
the
preceding
is
to
wrap
the
hams
in
muslin
and
bury
them
in
salt
the
muslin
keeps
the
salt
from
striking
in
and
the
salt
prevents
mould
and
insects
pumpkin
there
are
some
five
or
six
varieties
in
cultivation
loudon

six
and

has
five
the
number
is
increasing
and
names
becoming
uncertain
certain
varieties
are
called
pumpkins
by
some
and
squashes
by
others
the

it
has
doubtless
been
kept
through
several
years
without

pumpkins
will
grow
on
any
good
rich
soil
but
best
on
new
land
and
in
a
wet

do
best
alone
but
will
grow

this
is
a
root
eaten
only
raw

the
roots
are
more
tender

be
cleared
of
weeds
and
the
ground
stirred
before
the
plants
would
otherwise
be
discernible
and
also
shade
the
germinating
seeds
and
the
young
plants
from
destruction
from
a
hot
sun
the
radishes
may
be
pulled
out
when
the
main
crop
needs
the
ground
and
sun
for
this
purpose
the
scarlet
variety
is
used
because
the
long
root
loosens
the
soil
in
pulling
and
as
the
crown
stands
so
much
above
the
surface
they
may
be
crushed
down
with
a
small
roller
and
thus
destroyed
without
the
labor
of
pulling
sowing
among
and
cultivating
early
with
a
an
acre
of
roots
can
be
raised
with
about
the
same
labor
as
an
acre
of
corn
raspberry
the
common
black
raspberry
we
have
noticed
elsewhere
as
one
of
the
most
profitable
in
cultivation
the
other
varieties
worthy
of
general
cultivation
are
the
franconia
the
fastollf
the
red
and
the
white
or
yellow
antwerp
any
good
is
suitable
for
raspberries
it
should
be
worked
deep
and
have
decayed
wood
and
leaves
mixed
with
barnyard
manure
and
in
all
but
very
cold
latitudes
raspberries
should
be
planted
where
they
may
be
a
little
shaded
none
of
the
finer
old
varieties
produce
a
good
crop
of
fruit
without
the
canes
may
live
without
it
but
will
bear
but
little
fruit
the
best
method
of
protection
is
to
bend
down
the
canes
at
the
beginning
of
winter
before
the
ground
freezes
and
cover
them
lightly
with
the
soil
around
them
they
should
first
have
some
manure
put
around
the
canes
stools
should
be
four
feet
apart
and
have
about
five
or
six
canes
in
a
stool
cut
away
the
rest
the
best
of
all
manures
for
raspberries
is
said
to
be
spent
put
it
around
in
the
fall
to
the
depth
of
two
inches
work
it
into
the
soil
in
the
spring
and
put
around
fresh
to
the
same
depth
the
varieties
for
general
cultivation
are
few
the
common
black
is
one
of
the
best
the
common
wild
american
red
native
in
all
the
middle
and
eastern
states
is
greatly
improved
by
cultivation
as
it
is
perfectly
hardy
and
a
great
and
early
bearer
it
should
have
a
place
in
every
collection
the
franconia
is
a
fine
fruit
and
among
those
generally
cultivated
occupies
the
first
place
the
yellow
antwerp
is
and
but
too
soft
for
a
general
the
same
is
true
of
the
fastollf
the
red
antwerp
is
good
but
quite
inferior
to
the
new
red
antwerp
or
hudson
river
antwerp
the
ohio
evergreen
is
a
new
variety
hardy
prolific
and
a
long
bearer
fine
fruit
in
considerable
quantities
having
been
picked
on
the
of
november
on
this
account
it
should
be
in
every
garden
there
are
two
kinds
of
red
raspberries
brought
to
notice
by
lewis
allen
of
black
rock
that
deserve
extensive
cultivation
if
they
warrant
his
recommendation
allen
says
he
has
cultivated
them
for
a
number
of
years
and
with
no
winter
protection
they
have
borne
a
large
crop
of
excellent
fruit
every
year
pronounced
by
dealers
in
buffalo
market
superior
to
any
other
variety
should
these
varieties
prove
equally
good
elsewhere
they
deserve
a
place
in
every
garden
in
the
land
rhubarb
there
are
several
varieties
of
rhubarb
now
in
cultivation
victoria
mammoth
and
scotch
all
of
which
if
they
be
really
distinct
are
fine
and
large
under
proper
culture
there
is
much
of
the
old
inferior
kind
which
generally
affords
only
small
short
leaves
and
which
is
of
no
value
compared
with
the
large
varieties
the
method
of
growing
is
very
simple
and
yet
the
value
of
the
plant
depends
mainly
on
right
cultivation
propagation
is
by
seeds
or
by
dividing
the
roots
by
seed
is
preferable
the
idea
that
the
largest
kinds
will
not
produce
seed
is
incorrect
we
raised
four
or
five
quarts
of
seed
from
a
single
plant
of
the
largest
variety
in
one
season
young
plants
are
suitable
for
transplanting
after
the
first
year
growth
they
should
be
set
three
feet
apart
each
way
the
soil
should
be
thoroughly
enriched
and
trenched
two
feet
deep
with
plenty
of
manure
in
the
bottom
and
mixed
in
all
the
soil
plant
the
crowns
two
or
three
inches
below
the
surface
to
allow
stirring
the
ground
in
the
spring
without
injury
after
this
they
will
only
want
enriching
with
manure
in
rather
liberal
quantities
worked
in
with
a
fork
in
the
fall
or
spring
covering
up
with
manure
in
the
fall
is
good
those
who
raise
the
largest
leaves
lay
bare
the
crowns
in
spring
and
with
a
sharp
knife
remove
all
the
smaller
the
leaves
will
be
greatly
reduced
in
number
but
increased
in
size
we
have
often
seen
a
single
stem
of
a
leaf
that
weighed
a
full
pound
the
roots
live
many
years
we
know
a
single
root
in
lawrence
county
from
which
we
ate
pies
and
tarts
years
ago
and
which
is
now
so
vigorous
as
to
yield
more
than
a
supply
for
two
families
through
the
season
the
only
care
it
has
ever
had
has
been
liberal
supplies
of
manure
the
seed
stocks
have
generally
been
broken
off
they
should
always
be
unless
you
wish
to
raise
seed
then
save
one
or
two
of
the
strongest
new
crowns
come
out
on
the
sides
from
year
to
year
until
each
plant
will
cover
a
considerable
space
the
one
mentioned
as
being
years
old
has
never
been
moved
during
the
whole
time
it
is
not
the
giant
kind
but
the
leaves
are
large
and
long
rhubarb
has
a
better
flavor
and
requires
much
less
sugar
by
blanching
this
is
best
done
by
placing
an
old
barrel
without
a
bottom
over
the
hill
as
it
begins
to
grow
the
leaves
will
grow
long
with
white
tender
stems
use
it
when
the
leaves
are
half
or
full
grown
as
you
please
rice
this
in
its
value
to
the
world
as
an
article
of
food
is
next
to
indian
corn
it
is
the
main
article
of
diet
for
one
third
of
the
human
race
it
is
produced
only
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
and
its
cultivation
is
so
simple
and
easy
and
so
much
a
department
of
agriculture
by
itself
that
we
omit
directions
for
growing
it
the
ravages
of
the
so
destructive
to
rice
lying
in
bulk
are
prevented
by
the
application
of
common
salt
at
the
rate
of
half
a
pound
to
the
bushel
rocks
we
frequently
find
on
some
of
our
best
land
large
boulders
very
hard
and
too
large
to
be
removed
with
any
team
we
can
command
and
which
would
be
in
the
way
in
any
place
to
which
we
might
remove
them
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
them
when
it
can
be
afforded
is
to
burn
or
blast
them
into
pieces
small
enough
to
be
easily
handled
when
this
can
not
be
afforded
the
best
method
is
to
make
an
excavation
by
the
side
of
them
deep
enough
to
let
them
sink
below
the
reach
of
the
plow
and
allow
them
to
fall
in
being
careful
not
to
get
caught
by
them
roller
this
is
quite
as
indispensable
to
good
farming
and
gardening
as
any
other
tool
it
serves
a
great
variety
of
useful
purposes
the
first
is
to
pulverize
soils
no
man
can
get
a
full
crop
on
a
soil
not
made
fine
on
the
surface
however
rich
that
soil
may
be
it
is
often
the
case
that
land
needs
rolling
two
or
three
times
before
the
last
harrowing
and
sowing
the
seed
another
purpose
is
on
all
light
soils
to
place
the
soil
close
around
the
seeds
after
they
have
been
covered
when
this
is
not
done
seeds
will
vegetate
very
unevenly
and
in
dry
weather
some
of
them
not
at
all
another
advantage
of
rolling
a
is
the
greater
facility
and
economy
with
which
it
can
be
harvested
it
makes
a
level
smooth
surface
sinking
small
stones
out
of
the
way
of
the
scythe
or
reaper
rolling
makes
catch
when
sown
with
a
all
beds
of
small
seeds
as
onions
beets
carrots
parsnips
should
be
rolled
after
planting
it
will
so
smooth
the
surface
that
hoeing
and
cultivating
can
be
done
without
injury
to
the
plants
the
rows
are
also
much
more
easily
seen
while
the
plants
are
young
any
crop
will
grow
better
and
larger
by
not
being
too
much
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
on
its
roots
when
the
soil
is
coarse
part
of
the
seeds
and
roots
are
greatly
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
and
this
exposure
is
very
irregular
the
roller
so
crushes
the
lumps
and
fills
up
the
openings
in
the
soil
as
to
cause
the
atmosphere
to
act
regularly
on
the
whole
crop
few
farmers
stop
to
think
that
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
on
their
soils
is
fifteen
pounds
weight
on
every
square
inch
and
that
hence
the
air
must
penetrate
to
a
considerable
depth
into
the
soil
and
where
the
soil
is
coarse
the
air
enters
too
freely
and
acts
too
powerfully
for
the
good
of
the
plants
rollers
are
made
of
wood
iron
or
freestone
for
most
purposes
wood
is
best
a
log
made
true
and
even
or
better
narrow
plank
nailed
on
cylindrical
ends
are
the
usual
forms
from
eighteen
inches
to
three
feet
in
diameter
is
the
better
size
iron
or
stone
rollers
in
sections
are
best
for
pulverizing
soil
disposed
to
cake
from
being
annually
overflowed
with
water
or
from
other
causes
root
crops
it
is
important
that
american
farmers
learn
to
attach
much
greater
importance
to
the
culture
of
roots
the
potato
is
the
best
of
all
roots
for
feeding
but
as
the
yield
has
become
so
light
in
most
localities
and
the
demand
for
it
for
human
food
has
so
greatly
increased
it
will
no
longer
be
grown
extensively
as
food
for
animals
farmers
must
therefore
turn
their
attention
to
beets
carrots
and
parsnips
reasonable
tillage
will
produce
one
thousand
bushels
to
the
acre
of
beets
and
carrots
and
two
hundred
more
of
parsnips
these
roots
raw
or
cooked
are
valuable
for
all
domestic
animals
a
horse
will
do
better
on
part
oats
and
part
carrots
or
beets
than
upon
clear
oats
for
milch
cows
young
stock
and
fattening
cattle
and
for
sheep
and
fowls
they
are
highly
valuable
with
the
facilities
now
enjoyed
they
may
be
raised
at
a
cheap
rate
plant
scarlet
in
the
rows
to
shade
the
vegetating
seed
and
young
plants
and
to
mark
the
rows
to
facilitate
clearing
and
stirring
the
ground
while
the
plants
are
very
young
and
using
the
most
approved
and
the
same
amount
of
food
can
not
be
grown
at
the
same
price
in
any
other
crops
saffron
this
is
a
medicinal
herb
as
easily
grown
as
a
bean
or
sunflower
it
is
principally
used
in
eruptive
diseases
to
induce
moisture
of
the
skin
and
keep
the
eruption
out
sow
in
any
good
soil
in
rows
eighteen
inches
apart

this
is
a

grown
its
value
for
medicinal
and
culinary
purposes

well
known
it
is

or
by
dividing

raise
new
plants
once
in
three
or
four
years
plants
may
be
renovated
by
certain
culture
and
care
but
it
is
better
to
grow
new
ones
cut
the

two
or
three
times
in
the
season
and
dry
quickly
and
put
away
in
paper
bags
or
better
pulverize

cork
up
in
glass
bottles
this
is
the
best
method
of
preserving
all

for
domestic
use
salsify
or
vegetable
oyster
this
is
a
hardy
biennial
vegetable
resembling
a
small
parsnip
and
as
easily
grown
when
properly
cooked
its
flavor
resembles
the
oyster
whence
its
name
sow
and
cultivate
as
parsnips
or
carrots
it
is
suitable
for
use
from
november
to
may
it
is
better
for
being
allowed
to
remain
in
the
ground
until
wanted
for
use
though
it
may
be
well
kept
in
moist
sand
in
the
cellar
care
is
necessary
in
saving
seed
as
it
shells
and
blows
away
like
thistle
seed
as
soon
as
ripe
it
must
be
sown
quite
thick
on
account
of
its
proneness
not
to
vegetate
it
should
be
more
extensively
cultivated
scraping
land
this
is
a
process
needed
only
on
land
that
has
not
been
under
cultivation
long
enough
to
become
level
all
new
land
has
many
knolls
of
greater
or
less
size
as
soon
as
the
roots
are
out
sufficiently
to
allow
it
the
knolls
should
be
plowed
and
leveled
with
a
common
scraper
most
farmers
neglect
it
as
injurious
to
the
soil
and
too
expensive
but
when
we
consider
that
rough
land
never
gets
well
plowed
and
that
the
gradual
wearing
away
of
the
knolls
will
continue
their
unproductiveness
for
a
number
of
years
it
will
be
seen
that
the
cheapest
way
is
to
plow
and
scrape
the
land
level
at
once
and
thoroughly
manure
the
places
from
which
the
soil
has
been
scraped
seeds
the
best
of
everything
should
be
saved
for
seed
peas
beans
corn
tomatoes
should
not
be
gathered
promiscuously
finally
preserving
the
last
that
matures
for
seed
leave
some
of
the
finest
and
earliest
stocks
and
from
them
save
seed
not
from
the
first
or
the
last
that
matures
but
from
the
earliest
that
grows
large
and
fair
save
from
those
that
grow
largest
but
near
the
root
gather
all
seeds
as
soon
as
mature
as
remaining
exposed
to
the
weather
is
unfavorable
to

dry
in

not
too
near
a
stove
or
fire
keep
in
paper
bags

in
a
dry
airy
place
beyond
the
reach
of
mice
trying
the
quality
of
seeds
is
important
as
it
may
save
loss
and
disappointment
from
sowing
seeds
that
will
not
vegetate
a
little
cotton
wool
or
moss
in
a
tumbler
containing
a
little
water
and
placed
in
a
warm
room
will
afford
a
good
means
of
testing
seeds
seeds
placed
on
that
wool
will
vegetate
sooner
than
they
would
do
in
the
soil
but
a
more
speedy
and
generally
sure
method
is
by
putting
a
few
seeds
on
the
top
of
a
hot
stove
if
they
are
good
they
will
crack
like
corn
in
parching
otherwise
they
will
burn
without
noise
and
with
very
little
motion
the
improvement
or
declension
of
fruits
grains
and
vegetables
depend
very
materially
upon
the
manner
of
gathering
and
preserving
seeds
gather
promiscuously
and
late
and
keep
without
care
and
rapid
declension
will
be
the
result
gather
the
earliest
and
best
and
plant
only
the
very
best
of
that
saved
and
constant
improvement
will
be
secured
sheep
these
are
the
most
profitable
of
all
domestic
animals
the
original
cost
is
trifling
and
the
expense
of
raising
and
keeping
is
so
light
and
the
sale
of
meat
tallow
hide
and
wool
is
so
ready
that
is
always
profitable
so
important
has
this
always
been
considered
that
in
all
ages
of
the
world
there
have
been
shepherds
whose
sole
business
it
has
been
to
tend
their
flocks
were
the
flesh
of
sheep
and
lambs
more
extensively
substituted
for
that
of
swine
in
this
country
it
would
be
equally
healthy
and
economical
american
farmers
do
not
attach
to
half
the
importance
it
deserves
we
recommend
a
thorough
study
of
the
subject
in
the
use
of
the
facilities
afforded
by
the
writings
of
practical
men
we
can
only
give
the
outlines
of
the
subject
in
a
work
like
this
a
theory
has
been
scientifically
established
by
peter
a
brown
ll
of
philadelphia
in
which
it
is
shown
that
all
sheep
are
divided
into
two
species
and
these
species
crossed
produce
sheep
that
bear
both
wool
and
hair
as
the
two
never
change
the
hair
makes
blankets
that
will
not
shrink
the
wool
is
good
for
making
fulled
cloth
blankets
made
from
the
fleeces
of
sheep
that
are
the
product
of
the
cross
of
these
two
species
will
shrink
in
some
places
and
not
in
others
just
as
the
hair
or
wool
prevails
it
is
also
true
that
the
sheep
delight
in
low
moist
situations
and
while
the
sheep
does
best
on
high
airy
and
dry
land
these
fleeces
all
pass
as
wool
but
the
microscope
shows
a
marked
and
permanent
difference
and
one
can
easily
learn
to
distinguish
it
at
once
by
the
touch
and
with
the
naked
eye
this
is
thrown
out
here
to
induce
a
thorough
examination
of
the
whole
subject
there
are
three
staples
of
wool
short
three
inches
long
middling
five
inches
and
long
eight
inches
varieties
of
sheep
are
numerous
we
shall
only
mention
a
few
the
question
of
the
best
breeds
has
been
warmly
controverted
we
have
no
disposition
to
try
to
settle
it
the
question
of
the
best
variety
must
depend
upon
locality
and
design
if
the
wool
is
the
object
then
the
vermont
merino
for
the
north
and
the
pure
saxony
for
the
south
are
evidently
the
best
if
located
near
large
cities
where
the
flesh
is
the
main
object
then
the
breeds
are
much
preferable
among
those
much
esteemed
we
note
the
following
the
mature
young
and
the
flesh
will
vary
in
weight
from
fifteen
to
thirty
pounds
per
quarter
the

less
hardy
than
the
cotswold
but
heavier
weighing
from
to
pounds
per
quarter
the
improved
by
a
cross
with
the
leicester
is
considered
valuable
the

one
of
the
very
best

in
england
fat
ewes
average
twenty
pounds
per
quarter
and
wethers
from
thirty
to
pounds
the
and
varieties
of
the
down
sheep
are
all
highly
esteemed
the
are
very
valuable
an
ordinary
fleece
weighs
from
three
to
five
pounds
joseph
beers
of
new
jersey
had
one
that
sheared
thirteen
pounds
at
one
time
and
the
live
weight
of
the
sheep
was
pounds
there
are
and
much
esteemed
in
vermont
and
elsewhere
the
average
weight
of
a
flock
of
ewes
of
french
merinoes
after
shearing
was
pounds
their
fleeces
averaged
twelve
pounds
and
eight
ounces
the
fleece
of
one
buck
of
the
same
flock
weighed
twenty
pounds
and
twelve
ounces
illustration
the
french
merino
ram
the
are
smaller
but
produce
beautiful
fleeces
in
a
flock
of
nineteen
ewes
the
average
weight
of
fleece
was
seven
pounds
and
ten
ounces
and
that
of
the
buck
weighed
ten
and
a
half
pounds
a
large
flock
of
yielded
an
average
of
a
little
over
five
pounds
of
wool
all
these
varieties
are
valuable
for
wool
the
wool
of
the
pure
saxony
sheep
however
is
best
the
called
also
shanghae
and
broadtail
is
a
breed
of
great
promise
for
mutton
their
fleece
is
a
fine
silky
hair
making
fine
blankets
that
will
not
shrink
but
not
good
for
fulled
cloths
the
ewes
are
remarkably
prolific
producing
sometimes
five
lambs
at
a
time
and
often
twice
a
year
one
ewe
bore
seven
lambs
in
one
year
all
living
and
being
healthy
the
flesh
is
of
the
highest
quality
this
may
stand
at
the
head
of
all
our
sheep
as
a
market
animal
the
cross
of
this
with
our
common
sheep
has
proved
fine
they
need
to
be
further
tested
in
this
country
a
new
kind
of
sheep
has
also
been
imported
from
africa
within
a
few
years
a
variety
unknown
to
naturalists
but
having
some
points
in
common
with
the
tartar
sheep
of
there
are
several
that
have
been
very
troublesome
but
which
experience
has
enabled
us
to
cure
is
often
very
injurious
a
little
common
soot
from
the
chimney
or
pulverized
charcoal
is
a
sure
remedy
mix
it
with
water
not
so
thick
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
swallow
and
give
a
teaspoonful
every
two
hours
and
relief
will
soon
be
experienced
in
the
is
a
disease
caused
by
long
exposure
to
wet
and
cold
this
is
prevented
by
a
small
blanket
on
the
back
of
the
sheep
the
wool
on
the
backs
of
sheep
will
be
seen
to
be
often
parted
exposing
the
skin
water
falling
on
the
back
will
penetrate
the
wool
and
run
down
and
wet
and
chill
the
whole
body
a
small
cotton
blanket
fifteen
inches
wide
and
long
enough
to
reach
from
the
neck
to
the
tail
fastened
to
its
place
by
tying
to
the
wool
and
painted
on
the
outside
will
cause
all
the
water
to
run
off
saving
the
health
of
the
sheep
and
causing
him
to
require
less
food
in
the
cold
wet
season
every
sheep
should
have
such
a
blanket
they
would
cost
three
or
four
cents
each
and
be
worth
many
times
their
cost
in
the
saving
of
feed
for
the
animals
the
more
comfortable
an
animal
is
the
less
food
will
he
require
applying
tar
above
the
noses
of
sheep
at
shearing
that
they
may
be
compelled
to
smell
it
and
eat
a
little
for
a
long
time
is
considered
favorable
to
their
general
health
and
a
preventive
of
rot
the
in
cattle
sheep
and
hogs
is
a
prevalent
disease
boys
walking
the
path
barefoot
where
such
diseased
animals
frequently
pass
may
contract
the
disease
this
is
always
cured
by
washing
in
blue
vitriol
most
cases
are
cured
by
one
application
and
the
most
confirmed
by
two
or
three
make
a
narrow
passage
where
only
one
animal
can
pass
at
once
put
in
a
trough
twelve
feet
long
twelve
inches
wide
and
as
many
deep
put
in
that
fifty
pounds
of
blue
vitriol
and
fill
with
water
throwing
a
little
straw
over
the
top
cause
the
diseased
animals
to
pass
through
that
and
they
will
be
cured
this
is
thought
to
be
an
invariable
remedy
if
sheep
do
not
appear
healthy
on
lowland
pasture
give
them
small
quantities
of
fine
charcoal
and
salt
and
they
will
be
as
healthy
as
on
the
hills
a
little
salt
for
sheep
is
useful
during
the
whole
year
the
health
of
sheep
is
injured
more
in
fall
than
at
any
other
season
they
are
very
apt
to
be
neglected
at
the
beginning
of
winter
they
grow
poor
rapidly
when
their
green
feed
first
fails
a
little
hay
and
grain
and
a
few
roots
then
will
keep
them
up
prevent
disease
and
make
it
less
expensive
to
keep
them
through
the
winter
feed
in
racks
or
troughs
when
they
can
not
get
their
food
under
foot
and
as
far
as
practicable
under
shelter
and
in
a
warm
place
it
is
much
cheaper
and
keeps
the
sheep
much
more
healthy
they
should
have
fresh
water
where
they
can
drink
two
or
three
times
a
day
salt
mixed
with
and
pulverized
charcoal
should
also
be
constantly
within
their
reach
a
few
beets
carrots
or
parsnips
are
always
valuable
some
green
feed
is
very
essential
for
ewes
for
some
time
before
the
yeaning
season
corn
is
good
for
fattening
sheep
but
for
increasing
the
wool
it
is
not
half
as
valuable
as
beans
good
is
better
than
hay
is
excellent
the
product
of
one
and
a
half
acres
of
land
sowed
with
corn
will
winter
in
fine
condition
one
hundred
sheep
the
corn
sowed
the
of
june
and
cut
up
after
it
has
begun
to
lose
its
weight
slightly
and
shocked
up
closely
bound
round
the
top
with
straw
and
then
allowed
to
stand
till
wanted
for
feeding
to
have
healthy
sheep
do
not
use
a
ram
under
two
or
over
six
or
seven
years
old
and
raise
no
lambs
from
unhealthy
ewes
or
rams
the
expense
of
keeping
sheep
as
all
other
animals
is
much
less
when
they
are
kept
warm
much
feed
is
wasted
in
keeping
up
animal
heat
which
would
be
saved
by
warm
quarters
is
better
than
any
other
except
that
of
fowls
no
other
parts
with
its
qualities
by
exposure
so
slowly
some
farmers
save
all
labor
of
carting
and
spreading
by
having
movable
wire
fences
and
putting
their
sheep
on
one
acre
for
a
few
days
and
then
removing
to
another
one
hundred
sheep
may
thus
be
made
to
manure
an
acre
of
land
in
ten
days
better
than
any
ordinary
dressing
of
other
manure
we
should
prefer
carefully
collecting
and
saving
it
under
cover
mixed
with
muck
or
loam
and
apply
where
and
when
we
choose
keeping
a
suitable
number
of
sheep
on
a
farm
is
very
important
in
keeping
up
the
farm
a
farm
devoted
to
grain
or
vegetables
without
a
suitable
number
of
animals
usually
runs
down
the
time
when
lambs
should
be
allowed
to
come
is
important
we
much
prefer
letting
them
come
when
they
please
if
we
have
warm
quarters
and
can
take
a
little
extra
care
of
them
this
will
give
a
larger
growth
and
furnish
large
lambs
for
market
at
a
season
of
the
year
when
they
are
most
desired
and
bring
the
greatest
price
for
those
who
will
not
take
the
necessary
pains
let
them
come
when
the
weather
has
become
warm
and
grass
plenty
sometimes
a
ewe
loses
her
lamb
and
you
wish
her
to
raise
one
of
another
ewe
that
has
two
to
make
a
ewe
own
lamb
take
off
the
skin
of
her
dead
lamb
and
bind
it
on
to
the
other
lamb
and
she
will
smell
it
and
own
the
lamb
after
which
the
skin
may
be
removed
is
a
subject
to
which
farmers
should
give
increased
attention
until
the
average
weight
of
sheep
in
the
united
states
shall
become
one
third
greater
than
at
present
and
until
there
shall
be
ten
sheep

one

all
we
have
at
present
shepherdia

this
is
an
ornamental
shrub
growing
from
six
to
fifteen
feet
high
bearing
a
roundish
red
fruit
much
esteemed
for
preserves
trees
are
of
two
kinds
male
and
female
one
bearing
staminate
and
the
other
pistillate
flowers
hence
no
fruit
can
be
grown
without
setting
out
the

in
pairs
from
six
to
fifteen
feet
apart
if
you
set

you
will

soils
the
nature
and
management
of
soils
must
be
measurably
understood
by
any
one
who
would
be
a
thorough
cultivator
the
productive
power
of
a
soil
depends
much
upon
the
character
of
the
subsoil
a
gravelly
subsoil
is
on
the
whole
the
best
a
thin
soil
lying
on
a
cold
clay
subsoil
the
hardpan
of
the
east
and
the
crowfish
clay
of
the
west
however
rich
it
may
be
will
be
unproductive
while
the
same
soil
on
a
gravelly
subsoil
would
produce
abundantly
the
best
soils
for
all
purposes
are
the
brown
or
plowed
in
wet
weather
they
do
not
make
mortar
and
in
dry
weather
they
will
not
break
in
clods
and
russet
moulds
are
considered
the
next
best
the
worst
are
the
or
the
alluvial
soils
of
the
western
prairies
are
an
exception
to
all
other
soils
possessing
under
proper
treatment
great
powers
of
production
soils
do
not
to
any
considerable
extent
afford
food
for
plants
a
has
been
known
to
gain
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
weight
without
exhausting
more
than
two
or
three
ounces
of
the
soil
and
even
that
might
have
been
wasted
in
drying
and
weighing
in
our
article
on
manures
we
have
shown
that
it
is
the
texture
of
soils
and
their
power
to
control
moisture
and
heat
that
renders
them
productive
hence
no
soil
can
be
poor
that
is
stirred
deep
and
kept
in
a
friable
condition
without
being
too
open
and
porous
and
no
soil
can
be
good
that
is
hard
and
not
retentive
of
moisture
without
having
water
stand
upon
it
hence
the
great
secret
of
successful
farming
is
such
a
mixture
of
the
soils
and
of
fertilizers
with
the
soil
as
shall
keep
it
friable
and
moist
and
such
thorough
drainage
as
will
prevent
water
from
standing
so
as
to
become
stagnant
and
to
unduly
chill
the
roots
of
growing
plants
nature
has
provided
near
at
hand
all
that
is
essential
to
productiveness
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
properly
mix
them
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
an
acre
of
land
now
under
cultivation
in
the
united
states
in
a
latitude
where
corn
will
grow
on
which
we
can
not
raise
a
hundred
bushels
of
shelled
indian
corn
without
applying
anything
but
what
may
be
raised
out
of
that
soil
and
procured
in
the
shape
of
manure
by
animals
in
consuming
that
product
the
poorest
farm
in
america
may
be
brought
up
to
a
state
of
great
fertility
without
applying
one
dollar
worth
of
any
foreign
substance
plow
turn
under
all
the
green
substances
possible
and
feed
out
the
products
on
the
farm
and
apply
the
manure
and
mix
opposite
soils
that
may
be
found
in
different
localities
three
years
will
secure
great
productiveness
and
the
same
course
will
increase
its
value
from
year
to
year
without
cost
three
things
only
are
essential
to
convert
poor
land
into
the
best
deep
and
thorough
stirring
and
pulverization
suitable
draining
and
thorough
mixture
of
soils
of
different
qualities
and
the
incorporation
of
such
animal
and
vegetable
substances
as
can
be
produced
on
the
land
itself
we
would
not
declare
against
foreign
manures
but
insist
that
the
necessary
ingredients
are
found
or
may
be
manufactured
near
at
hand
the
philosophy
of
deep
plowing
and
thorough
pulverization
is
obvious
a
fine
soil
will
retain
and
appropriate
moisture
in
an
eminent
degree
on
the
principle
of
capillary
attraction
or
as
a
sponge
or
a
piece
of
loaf
sugar
will
take
up
water
there
is
also
room
for
excess
of
water
to
sink
away
from
the
surface
and
return
again
when
needed
it
also
affords
room
for
the
roots
of
plants
such
a
soil
also
receives
moisture
from
the
atmosphere
the
atmosphere
also
contains
much
water
and
more
in
the
heat
of
summer
than
at
any
other
time
the
air
also
with
a
constant
pressure
of
fifteen
pounds
to
the
square
inch
enters
to
a
considerable
depth
into
the
soil
and
the
deeper
it
is
stirred
and
the
more
thoroughly
it
is
pulverized
the
more
it
will
enter
in
coming
in
contact
with
the
cool
moisture
below
it
is
condensed
and
waters
the
soil
on
the
principle
that
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
in
a
warm
room
has
large
drops
of
water
on
the
outside
that
water
is
a
mere
condensation
of
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
the
cool
subsoil
acts
in
the
same
way
upon
the
atmosphere
at
night
a
deeply
disintegrated
soil
also
seldom
washes
by
rain
and
coarse
land
sends
off
the
water
after
a
slight
rain
while
and
thoroughly
pulverized
land
retains
it
the
philosophy
of
manures
involves
the
same
principles
all
the
fertilizers
act
upon
soils
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
them
fine
and
open
an
immense
surface
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
and
form
large
reservoirs
for
moisture
through
their
innumerable
fine
pores
draining
is
to
carry
off
an
excess
of
water
that
would
stand
on
an
unfavorable
subsoil
that
water
on
undrained
land
causes
two
evils
it
stagnates
and
renders
plants
unhealthy
and
it
is
too
cool
rendering
land
what
we
call
cold
thus
the
deeper
you
plow
land
and
the
finer
you
make
it
the
warmer
it
will
be
and
the
more
perfectly
it
will
control
moisture
mixing
soils
by
subsoiling
trenching
and
deep
plowing
and
by
carting
on
foreign
substances
is
wholly
on
this
principle
sand
that
drifts
about
with
the
wind
is
too
light
to
retain
moisture
and
needs
clay
carted
on
by
this
means
the
poorest
white
sand
has
often
been
converted
into
the
most
productive
soil
definite
rules
for
this
mixture
of
soils
can
not
be
safely
given
the
rules
must
differ
in
different
localities
and
circumstances
it
must
therefore
be
determined
by
experiment
analyzing
soils
is
sometimes
of
use
but
usually
has
too
much
importance
attached
we
do
not
advise
farmers
to
study
it
let
them
try
applications
and
mixtures
at
first
on
a
small
scale
they
will
soon
learn
what
is
best
on
their
farms
and
may
then
proceed
without
loss
some
lands
are
of
such
a
character
that
the
carting
on
and
suitably
mixing
the
substances
in
which
they
are
deficient
may
cost
as
much
as
it
did
to
clear
the
land
of
its
original
forest
but
it
will
pay
well
for
a
long
series
of
years
so
well
are
we
persuaded
of
the
utility
and
correctness
of
these
brief
hints
that
in
selecting
a
farm
we
should
regard
the
location
more
than
the
quality
of
the
soil
the
latter
we
could
mend
easily
while
we
should
find
it
difficult
to
move
our
farm
to
a
more
favorable
location
poor
land
near
a
city
or
large
town
or
on
some
great
thoroughfare
we
should
much
prefer
to
good
land
far
removed
from
market
or
in
an
unpleasant
location
spinage
or
spinach
both
these
names
are
correct
the
former
is
the
general
one
among
americans
this
plant
is
used
in
soups
but
more
generally
boiled
alone
and
served
as
greens
in
the
spring
of
the
year
this
is
one
of
the
most
wholesome
vegetables
by
sowing
at
different
times
we
may
have
it
at
any
season
of
the
year
but
it
is
more
tender
and
succulent
in
the
spring
the
male
and
female
flowers
are
produced
on
separate
plants
the
male
blossoms
are
in
long
terminal
spikes
and
the
female
in
clusters
close
at
the
stalk
on
each
joint
the
two
best
are
the
or
and
the
or
there
are
three
others
the
patience
the
or
and
the
the
first
two
are
sufficient
sow
in
august
and
september
for
winter
and
spring
use
and
in
spring
for
summer
sow
in
rich
soil
in
drills
eighteen
inches
apart
thin
to
three
inches
in
the
row
and
when
large
enough
for
use
remove
every
other
one
leaving
them
six
inches
apart
to
raise
seed
have
male
plants
at
convenient
distances
say
one
in
two
or
three
feet
when
they
have
done
blossoming
remove
the
male
plants
giving
all
the
room
to
the
others
for
perfecting
the
seed
success
depends
upon
very
rich
soil
and
plenty
of
moisture
squash
there
are
several
varieties
of
both
summer
and
winter
squashes
all
the
summer
varieties
have
a
hard
shell
when
matured
they
are
usually
eaten
entire
outside
seeds
and
all
while
young
and
tender
from
one
quarter
to
almost
full
grown
they
are
also
used
as
a
fall
and
winter
squash
rejecting
the
shell
and
that
portion
of
the
inside
which
contains
the
seeds
the
and
both
and
are
the
principal
summer
squashes
the
finest
is
the
the
best
winter
varieties
are
the
and
or
potato
the
latter
is
the
best
known
cultivate
as
melons
but
leave
only
two
plants
in
a
hill
they
do
best
on
new
land
varieties
should
be
grown
far
apart
and
far
removed
from
pumpkins
as
they
mix
very
easily
and
at
a
great
distance
bugs
eat
them
worse
than
any
other
garden
vegetable
the
only
sure
remedy
is
the
box
covered
with
gauze
or
glass
as
they
are
great
runners
they
do
better
with
their
ends
clipped
off
used
as
a
vegetable
for
the
table
and
in
the
same
manner
as
pumpkins
for
pies
strawberry
none
of
our
small
fruits
are
more
esteemed
or
more
easily
raised
and
yet
none
more
frequently
fails
failures
always
result
from
carelessness
or
the
want
of
a
little
knowledge
of
the
best
methods
of
cultivation
we
omit
much
that
might
be
said
of
the
history
and
uses
of
the
strawberry
and
confine
ourselves
to
a
few
brief
directions
which
if
strictly
followed
will
render
every
cultivator
uniformly
successful
no
one
need
ever
fail
of
growing
a
good
crop
of
strawberries
in
we
saw
plats
of
strawberries
in
illinois
in
the
cultivation
of
which
much
money
had
been
expended
and
which
were
remarkably
promising
when
in
blossom
but
which
did
not
yield
the
cultivators
five
dollars
worth
of
fruit
in
the
language
of
the
proprietors
they
blasted
strawberries
never
blast
but
for
the
want
of
fertilizers
at
suitable
distances
they
may
not
fill
there
are
but
three
causes
of
failure
want
of
fertilizers
excessive
drought
and
allowing
the
vines
to
become
too
thick
of
most
of
our
best
varieties
the
blossoms
are
of
two
kinds
pistillate
and
staminate
or
male
and
female
and
they
are
essential
to
each
other
the
pistillate
plants
bear
the
fruit
and
the
staminates
are
the
fertilizers
without
which
the
pistillates
will
be
fruitless
there
are
three
kinds
of
blossom
pistillate
staminate
and
perfect
as
seen
in
the
cut
illustration
perfect
blossom
staminate
blossom
pistillate
blossom
the
first
is
perfect
that
is
has
both
the
stamens
and
pistils
well
developed
this
will
produce
a
fair
crop
of
fruit
without
the
presence
of
any
other
variety
the
second
has
the
stamens
large
while
the
pistils
the
apparently
small
green
strawberry
in
the
centre
are
not
sufficiently
developed
to
produce
fruit
such
plants
seldom
bear
more
than
a
few
berries
the
third
has
pistils
in
abundance
but
is
destitute
of
stamens
and
hence
will
not
bear
alone
the
two
latter
are
to
be
placed
near
each
other
to
render
them
productive
they
may
be
readily
distinguished
when
in
blossom
it
is
always
safe
to
cultivate
the
hermaphrodite
plants
that
is
those
producing
perfect
blossoms
but
the
pistillates
and
staminates
in
due
proportions
produce
the
largest
crops
and
finer
fruit
much
has
been
said
against
high
fertilization
with
animal
manures
and
in
favor
of
vegetable
mould
only
we
feel
entirely
satisfied
that
the
largest
crops
of
strawberries
are
grown
on
land
highly
manured
with
common
barnyard
manure
to
plant
and
manure
a
begin
on
one
side
and
dig
a
trench
eighteen
inches
deep
from
two
to
three
feet
is
much
better
and
as
wide
put
six
inches
of
common
manure
in
the
bottom
dig
another
trench
as
deep
and
place
the
soil
upon
the
manure
in
the
first
trench
fill
the
last
with
manure
as
the
first
and
so
on
over
the
whole
plat
manure
the
surface
lightly
with
very
fine
manure
and
is
usually
better
in
the
month
of
august
if
done
at
that
season
and
it
be
not
too
dry
the
plants
will
get
such
a
growth
the
same
season
as
to
produce
quite
a
good
crop
of
fruit
the
next
season
planted
as
early
in
the
spring
as
it
will
do
to
stir
the
soil
they
are
more
sure
to
grow
and
yield
a
very
few
berries
the
first
season
and
very
abundantly
the
next
if
you
would
cultivate
in
hills
put
them
two
feet
apart
each
way
if
otherwise
two
feet
one
way
and
one
foot
the
other
cut
off
the
roots
to
two
or
three
inches
in
length
and
remove
all
the
dead
leaves
dip
them
in
mud
which
is
a
great
means
of
causing
them
to
grow
and
set
them
in
fine
mould
the
crown
one
inch
below
the
level
of
the
soil
around
and
leave
it
in
a
slight
basin
and
water
it
unless
the
weather
be
damp
many
plants
are
lost
from
not
being
set
low
enough
to
escape
drought
the
basin
will
hold
water
and
nearly
every
plant
will
grow
excessive
water
will
destroy
them
set
out
three
or
four
rows
of
pistillate
plants
and
then
one
of
the
staminates
or
fertilizers
some
set
them
out
in
beds
and
allow
them
to
cover
the
whole
ground
and
cultivate
by
spading
up
the
bed
in
alternate
sections
of
eighteen
inches
or
two
feet
each
year
turning
under
in
the
spring
that
portion
that
bore
fruit
the
previous
season
which
has
long
been
recommended
by
good
authority
this
was
the
lamented
downing
method
we
think
rows
preferable
for
this
reason
the
young
plants
formed
by
the
runners
are
less
vigorous
after
the
first
hence
the
tendency
is
to
deterioration
by
this
mode
of
culture
and
this
method
does
not
afford
so
good
an
opportunity
for
stirring
the
soil
around
the
plants
as
planting
in
rows
this
stirring
the
soil
is
a
great
means
of
protecting
from
drought
and
securing
the
most
vigorous
growth
deep
subsoiling
between
the
rows
early
in
the
spring
or
after
fruiting
is
valuable
hence
we
always
advise
to
cultivate
in
hills
two
feet
apart
each
way
and
renew
them
after
they
have
borne
two
or
at
most
three
crops
hermaphrodites
are
best
for
cultivation
in
beds
many
do
well
the
first
year
of
their
bearing
but
are
almost
useless
afterward
the
cultivator
says
they
all
run
to
vines
in
such
cases
they
overlook
the
fact
that
the
staminate
plants
grow
altogether
the
fastest
because
their
strength
goes
to
support
foliage
in
the
absence
of
fruit
while
bearing
vines
require
much
of
their
strength
to
mature
the
fruit
hence
if
they
are
allowed
to
run
together
the
second
or
at
most
the
third
year
the
fertilizers
will
monopolize
the
ground
and
prevent
fruiting
this
is
the
greatest
cause
of
failure
of
a
crop
next
to
a
want
of
both
kinds
of
plants
this
is
the
origin
of
fears
of
having
land
too
rich
it
is
said
it
all
runs
to
vines
without
fruit
this
is
because
the
wrong
vines
have
intruded
the
staminates
have
overcome
the
pistillates
we
reject
the
whole
theory
of
the
luxuriance
of
the
vines
preventing
the
production
of
fruit
the
larger
the
vines
the
more
fruit
provided
only
the
vines
are
bearers
and
not
too
thick
hence
this
invariable
rule
have
fertilizers
within
five
feet
and
never
allow
the
two
kinds
to
run
manures
should
be
applied
in
august
well
spaded
in
applying
in
the
spring
to
increase
the
crop
for
that
season
is
like
feeding
chickens
in
the
morning
to
fatten
them
for
dinner
it
is
too
late
fertilizing
in
august
is
a
good
preparation
for
a
large
crop
for
the
next
season
in
all
freezing
climates
should
be
covered
late
in
the
fall
with
or
straw
to
protect
from
the
severity
of
winter
and
enrich
the
land
by
what
can
be
dug
into
the
soil
in
spring
rotten
wood
fine
chips
sawdust
are
all
good
for
a
fall
after
well
hoeing
and
weeding
in
spring
until
appear
just
before
the
blossoms
open
cover
the
bed
thoroughly
with
spent
tanbark
sawdust
or
fine
straw
this
will
keep
down
weeds
preserve
moisture
in
the
soil
enrich
the
ground
and
protect
the
fruit
from
injury
by
rains
and
in
part
from
worms
and
insects
this
should
never
be
omitted
are
numerous
and
from
the
ease
with
which
they
are
raised
from
seed
will
rapidly
increase
it
is
so
frequent
to
have
blossoms
fertilized
by
pollen
from
several
different
varieties
some
of
the
most
marked
varieties
are
known
in
different
parts
of
the
country
by
very
different
names
hence
we
advise
cultivators
to
select
the
best
in
their
locality
every

we
repeat
our
recommendation
to
select
the
best
you
can
find
near

the
following
rules
will
insure
success
make
the
ground
very
rich
put
fertilizers
within
five
feet
of
each
other
and
never
allow
different
kinds
to
run
together
cover
the
ground
two
inches
deep
with
sawdust
or
fine
straw
just
before
the
blossoms
open
is
best
never
allow
the
vines
to
become
very
thick
but
thin
them
out
water
every
day
from
the
appearance
of
the
blossoms
until
done
gathering
the
fruit
this
increases
the
crop
largely
and
at
the
south
has
continued
the
vines
in
bearing
until
november
daily
watering
will
prolong
the
bearing
season
greatly
in
all
climates
and
greatly
increase
the
crop
protect
in
winter
by
a
slight
covering
of
coarse
straw
or
cornstalks
to
get
a
late
crop
keep
the
vines
covered
deep
with
straw
you
can
retard
their
maturity
two
weeks
and
daily
watering
will
prolong
it
for
weeks
apply
twice
in
the
fall
and
once
in
the
spring
a
solution
of
potash
one
pound
in
two
pails
of
water
or
two
pounds
in
a
barrel
of
water
in
which
has

the
best
general
applications
to
the
soil
in
preparing
the

are
lime
charcoal

to
two
of

three
of

sugar
there
have
until
recently
been
but
two
general
sources
of
our
supply
of
sugar
the
of
the
south
and
the
of
the
north
will
not
be
extensively
manufactured
in

we
now
have
added

and
surely
and
much
in
the
same
way
of
the
methods
of
making
sugar
from
the
old
of
the
south
we
need
give
no
account
it
is
not
an
article
of
general
domestic
manufacture
it
is
made
on
a
large
scale
on
plantations
and
is
in
itself
simple
and
easily
learned
by
the
few
who
become
the
process
of
manufacturing
sugar
from
the
is
very
simple
and
everywhere
known
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
our
are
being
so
extensively
destroyed
and
that
those
we
pretend
to
keep
for
are
so
unmercifully
hacked
up
in
the
process
of
extracting
the
sap
to
so
tap
the
trees
as
to
do
them
the
least
possible
injury
is
a
matter
of
much
importance
whether
it
should
be
done
by
boring
and
plugging
up
with
green
after
the
season
is
over
or
be
done
by
cutting
a
small
gash
with
an
axe
and
leaving
open
has
been
a
disputed
point
many
prefer
the
axe
and
think
the
tree
will
be
less
blackened
in
the
wood
and
will
last
longer
provided
it
be
judiciously
performed
cut
a
small
smooth
gash
one
year
tap
the
tree
low
and
another
high
and
on
alternate
sides
scatter
the
wounds
made
from
year
to
year
as
much
as
possible
another
process
of
tapping
is
now
most
popular
with
all
who
have
tried
it
bore
into
the
tree
half
an
inch
with
a
bit
not
larger
than
an
inch
slanting
slightly

standing

or
water
may
not
blacken
the
wood
make
the
spout

the

over
a
semicircular
groove
in
a
stick
of
hard
wood
and
place
an
iron
rod
on
it
lengthwise
over
the
groove
slight
blows
with
a
hammer
will
bend
it
these
can
be
driven
into
the

below
the

they

not

deepen
it
a
little
by
boring
again
or
by
taking
out
a
small
piece
with
a
gouge
this
process
will
injure
the
trees
less
than
any
other
the
spouts
will
be
cheaper
than
wooden

last
twenty
years

cost
only
about
cents

and
with
good

last
twenty
years
a
crook
in
the

will
make
a
good
place
to

a
hole
bored
in
the
ear
of
other
buckets
will
answer
the
same
purpose
in
all
windy
situations
the
bucket
must
be
near
the
end
of
the
spout

great
care
to
keep
all
vessels
used
clean
and
sweet
and
not
burn
the
sugar
in
finishing
it
will
enable
any
one
to
succeed
in
making
good
the
various
forms
in
which
it
is
put
up
and
the
manner
of
draining
are
familiar
to
all
makers
it
is
only
necessary
to
add
that
there
are
few
small
farms
on
which
the
will
grow
where
there
might
not
be
raised
two
or
three
hundred
maples
within
fifteen
or
twenty
years
that
would
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
comfort
and
value
of
the
farm
on
the
highway
as
or
on
the
side
of
lots
they
would
be
very
ornamental
and
profitable
without
doing
injury
we
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
raising
always
cultivate
trees
that
will
bear
fruit
yield
sugar
or
be
good
for
timber
sorgho
or
chinese
is
raised
much
as
indian
corn
only
it
will
bear
some
ten
or
twelve
stalks
in
a
hill
instead
of
three
or
four
in
all
parts
of
our
continent
it
produces
enormous
crops
of
stalks
the
trials
thus
far
indicate
that
the
quantity
of
saccharine
matter
it
contains
is
not
quite
equal
to
that
of
the
common
but
with
the
necessary
facilities
for
manufacturing
it
makes
quite
as
good
sugar
and
as
fine
sirups
as
the
other
cane
suitable
machinery
that
need
not
be
expensive
owned
by
a
neighborhood
of
farmers
may
enable
all
northern
men
where
other
cane
will
not
grow
to
make
their
own
sugar
cheaper
than
to
buy
but
it
will
be
made
probably
by
large
establishments
as
other
sugar
we
give
no
method
of
making
it
the
subject
is
so
new
that
every
method
of
manufacture
finds
its
way
into
all
the
newspapers
and
what
might
appear
the
best
would
be
quite
antiquated
we
have
seen
as
fine
sugars
and
sirups
of
all
the
different
grades
made
from
this
new
cane
as
any
others
we
have
ever
tasted
the
question
is
settled
that
imphee
and
sorgho
will
make
good
sugar
in
abundance
a
few
years
will
place
such
sugars
among
the
great
staple
products
of
the
country
this
is
a
hardy
annual
raised
from
seed
on
any
good
soil
with
no
care
but
keeping
free
from
weeds
the
seed
is
small
and
may
not
vegetate
well
in
dry
warm
weather
without
a
little
shade
or
regular
watering
its
use
for
culinary
and
medicinal
purposes
is
well
known
gather

nearly
ripe
keep

for
the
benefit
of
persons
who
keep
those
sprightly
pets
called
fleas
we
mention
the
fact
that
dry
leaves
put
in
the
straw

will
expel
those

sunflower
this
large
hardy
annual
plant
would
be
considered
very
beautiful
were
it
not
so
common
three
quarts
of
clear
beautiful
oil
are
expressed
from
a
bushel
of
the
seed
in
the
same
way
as
the
seed
in
small
quantities
is
good
for
fowls
it
may
be
grown
with
less
labor
than
corn
sweet
potato
this
is
a
southern
plant
but
is
now
being
acclimated
in
northern
latitudes
good
sweet
potatoes
are
now
grown
in
the
colder
parts
of
vermont
wisconsin
and
minnesota
there
are
many
varieties
and
they
are
increasing
by
seedlings
not
long
since
they
were
said
to
bear
no
seed
but
recently
in
different
parts
of
the
country
seeds
have
been
found
and
new
varieties
grown
from
them
certain
varieties
are
best
in
different
localities
they
will
always
find
their
way
through
growers
of
plants
the
process
of
growing
is
simple
but
must
be
carefully
followed
to
insure
success
plant
the
seed
potatoes
in
a
moderate
hotbed
at
the
time
when
grass
begins
to
start
freely
keep
well
watered
and
do
not
allow
them
to
get
too
warm
an
hour
will
cause
them
all
to
decay
the
heat
when
it
begins
to
rise
too
high
is
at
once
checked
by
a
thorough
drenching
with
cold
water
if
too
low
the
heat
is
raised
by
a
tight
cover
in
a
warm
sun
and
by
watering
with
warm
water
water
them
every
day
after
they
are
up
the
sprouts
when
six
inches
high
are
pulled
off
from
the
potato
and
set
out
as
this
should
be
done
as
soon
as
all
danger
of
frost
has
ceased
the
same
potatoes
will
sprout
as
many
times
as
they
are
pulled
off
sweet
potatoes
need
much
sun
and
warmth
they
are
therefore
planted
on
round
hills
or
better
on
ridges
which
may
be
principally
thrown
up
with
a
plow
and
made
from
a
foot
to
eighteen
inches
high
set
the
plants
in
the
top
about
fifteen
inches
or
two
feet
apart
keep
clear
of
weeds
making
the
hill
or
ridge
a
little
larger
by
each
hoeing
the
tops
being
long
running
vines
will
soon
cover
the
ground
they
produce
better
tubers
for
throwing
the
vines
in
a
twist
up
over
the
top
of
the
rows
they
will
take
root
at
each
joint
of
vine
when
undisturbed
which
roots
will
draw
from
the
main
tuber
these
roots
would
be
as
good
and
large
as
any
if
they
had
time
hence
at
the
south
one
half
of
the
crop
is
grown
from
sets
from
cuttings
of
the
ends
of
the
vines
at
the
north
where
seasons
are
short
these
joints
must
be
prevented
by
throwing
up
as
above
or
loosening
from
taking
root
the
tubers
will
need
all
the
strength
the
plant
and
tuber
are
tender
and
a
little
frost
will
kill
the
vines
and
cause
the
potatoes
to
decay
they
may
be
kept
for
use
until
january
by
packing
when
dug
in
a
warm
day
in
the
soil
in
which
they
grew
kept
through
winter
packed
in
straw
or
chaff
in
boxes
that
will
contain
about
two
or
three
bushels
each
and
kept
in
a
room
with
a
fire
the
room
should
be
at
a
temperature
of
from
forty
to
sixty
degrees
is
best
though
seventy
will
not
destroy
them
more
or
less
will
cause
them
to
decay
the
boxes
may
be
placed
one
upon
another
but
should
be
left
open
that
their
moisture
may
evaporate
dry
sand
sifted
over
and
close
among
them
will
preserve
them
free
circulation
of
air
is
indispensable
it
is
usually
cheapest
to
buy
the
plants
of
those
who
make
a
business
of
raising
them
they
are
very
hardy
may
be
transported
one
thousand
miles
and
do
just
as
well
to
transplant
with
perfect
safety
in
a
dry
time
after
the
plant
has
been
put
in
its
place
pour
in
a
pint
of
water
and
cover
it
with
a
little
dry
soil
to
prevent
baking
and
not
one
out
of
fifty
will
perish
these
few
brief
directions
will
enable
any
one
to
be
successful
wherever
corn
will
grow
a
new
variety
has
just
been
brought
into
alabama
from
peru
that
is
pronounced
superior
to
all
others
a
prodigious
bearer
even
on
poor
sandy
land
and
far
more
hardy
than
other
varieties
the
root
retaining
its
excellence
as
it
came
out
of
the
ground
till
the
following
may
swine
hogs
are
evil
in
their
propensities
mischievous
and
filthy
in
their
habits
and
yet
profitable
to
the
farmer
every
farmer
should
keep
a
few
in
proportion
to
the
refuse
grain
and
various
slops
that
his
establishment
may
afford
buying
hogs
and
then
purchasing
grain
on
which
to
fatten
them
in
the
usual
way
is
the
poorest
economy
such
pork
is
often
made
to
cost
from
twelve
to
twenty
cents
per
pound
there
are
many
breeds
of
swine
highly
recommended
some
of
the
varieties
of
the
chinese
are
the
most
prolific
and
have
the
greatest
tendency
to
fattening
of
any
known
they
have
formed
the
basis
of
the
great
improvements
in
the
breeds
in
great
britain
farmers
will
be
able
to
select
the
best
breed
from
their
own
knowledge
and
observation
better
than
from
any
directions
we
can
give
them
every
new
variety
will
be
introduced
by
dealers
and
farmers
must
be
cautious
how
they
accept
their
representations
of
swine
for
it
is
most
profitable
and
least
troublesome
to
keep
over
winter
no
swine
but
breeding
sows
to
have
pigs
early
in
spring
to
kill
in
autumn
of
any
of
the
good
breeds
they
can
be
made
to
weigh
from
to
pounds
by
the
proper
time
for
killing
the
practice
of
keeping
swine
till
eighteen
or
months
old
and
only
fattening
them
late
in
the
fall
and
beginning
of
winter
is
very
unprofitable
it
is
best
to
give
pigs
about
what
they
will
eat
from
the
time
of
beginning
to
feed
them
until
they
are
slaughtered
this
is
in
every
way
most
economical
it
secures
fattening
in
the
hot
weather
in
summer
when
pork
can
be
made
faster
and
cheaper
than
at
any
other
time
many
farmers
begin
to
fatten
their
pork
after
the
season
in
which
it
can
most
rapidly
and
cheaply
be
done
hogs
having
been
kept
poor
on
being
fed
freely
for
fattening
become
cloyed
and
much
time
is
lost
while
those
that
always
have
had
what
they
would
eat
of
good
wholesome
food
always
have
a
good
appetite
for
as
much
as
they
need
and
not
root
over
and
injure
more
for
they
do
better
shut
up
in
a
pen
but
where
they
can
get
access
to
the
ground
all
edible
roots
are
good
and
all
the
grains
but
grain
should
be
ground
or
soaked
it
pays
well
to
cook
all
food
for
swine
boiled
potatoes
carrots
beets
and
parsnips
are
all
good
ground
feed
should
be
mixed
with
cooked
vegetables
the
disposition
that
swine
have
to
root
deep
in
the
ground
indicates
the
want
of
something
not
found
in
sufficient
quantities
in
their
ordinary
food
numerous
experiments
show
that
that
deficiency
is
abundantly
supplied
by
having
charcoal
within
their
reach
the
stories
of
fattening
pork
wholly
on
charcoal
which
we
find
in
the
books
we
do
not
credit
but
that
small
quantities
of
it
are
uniformly
healthy
for
swine
is
an
established
fact
the
question
of
sour
food
has
many
respectable
advocates
cultivators
and
writers
take
different
sides
of
the
question
based
as
they
say
upon
their
and
noted
experiments
one
affirming
that
fermented
food
is
superior
and
others
that
it
has
done
his
hogs
positive
injury
this
discrepancy
grows
out
of
not
carefully
distinguishing
the
different
kinds
of
fermentation
the
sweet
the
vinous
the
acid
and
the
putrid
the
first
makes
excellent
food
the
second
will
do
quite
well
the
third
is
injurious
and
the
last
absolutely
poisonous
as
it
requires
much
care
and
observation
to
get
this
right
and
mistakes
are
easy
it
is
best
to
take
the
sure
method
give
them
food
in
a
natural
state
ground
and
either
cooked
or
fed
raw
either
will
make
good
pork
at
a
reasonable
cost
but
cooked
food
is
preferable
sows
are
prevented
from
destroying
their
young
by
quiet
plenty
of
food
and
little
animal
food
and
but
a
very
little
straw
in
a
dry
pen
or
washing
the
pig
backs
with
a
strong
decoction
of
aloes
tobacco
this
is
a
plant
abhorred
by
everything
but
man
and
the
its
use
for
chewing
and
snuffing
is
happily
becoming
more
and
more
offensive
to
refined
society
and
we
hope
it
may
after
a
long
struggle
go
out
of
use
for
those
who
will
cultivate
it
as
an
article
of
commerce
the
following
brief
directions
are
sufficient
burn
over
a
small
bed
on
which
sow
the
seed
early
in
march
when
the
leaves
are
as
large
as
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
transplant
them
in
deep
rich
soil
or
on
new
land
in
rows
three
feet
apart
each
way
or
four
feet
one
way
and
two
the
other
tend
as
cabbage
it
is
necessary
twice
in
the
season
to
destroy
by
hand
the
large
green
worms
that
feed
on
this
plant
when
the
plants
are
from
two
and
a
half
to
three
and
a
half
feet
high
according
to
the
richness
of
the
soil
on
which
they
grow
pick
out
the
head
or
except
in
the
few
plants
you
would
have
go
to
seed
pinch
off
also
the
suckers
or
shoots
behind
the
leaves
as
they
come
out
when
the
leaves
are
full
grown
and
begin
to
ripen
which
is
known
by
the
small
dusky
spots
appearing
on
the
leaves
cut
up
the
stalks
and
lay
them
down
singly
to
wilt
when
they
are
thoroughly
wilted
lay
them
together
that
they
may
sweat
for
hours
then
hang
them
up
in
a
tolerably
tight
room
to
dry
hang
across
poles
one
on
each
side
a
sharp
stick
put
through
the
but
of
the
stalks
and
laid
over
the
pole
leaving
one
stalk
on
each
side
is
a
very
good
method
when
it
becomes
well
dried
pick
off
the
leaves
and
tie
the
stems
together
in
small
bunches
and
pack
away
in
hogsheads
or
boxes
in
a
dry
place
we
recommend
to
every
agriculturist
to
cultivate
a
little
tobacco
not
for
himself
or
others
to
chew
snuff
or
smoke
but
to
use
in
destroying
insects
a
strong
decoction
used
in
washing
animals
will
destroy
lice
on
horses
and
cattle
and
ticks
on
sheep
applied
to
plants
or
trees
will
effectually
destroy
all
insects
with
which
they
may
be
infested
boil
or
stalks
or
the
of
the
until
you
make
a
strong
decoction
and
apply
with
a
syringe
or
in
any
other
way
and
it
will
prove
more
effectual
than
anything
else
known
stalks
or
leaves
laid
around
in
the
month
of
may
will
protect
them
from
the
attacks
of
the
borer
this
is
also
a
good
manure
for
tomato
this
vegetable
is
well
known
and
has
recently
come
to
be
generally
esteemed
it
can
always
be
grown
without
failure
and
more
easily
and
at
one
fourth
of
the
cost
of
potatoes
its
use
for
cooking
eating
raw
and
pickling
in
various
forms
is
known
to
all
there
are
several
varieties
the
best
of
all
is
the
large
red
not
the
largest
but
the
smooth
ones
although
smaller
they
contain
more
and
are
much
more
conveniently
used
than
the
very
large
rough
or
scolloped
variety
the
large
yellow
are
less
liable
to
decay
on
the
vines
and
have
less
of
the
tomato
taste
the
small
both
red
and
yellow
and
the
pear
or
are
good
for
preserving
as
a
common
sweetmeat
and
for
pickling
whole
they
should
be
started
in
early
hotbed
in
february
in
the
middle
states
and
transplanted
after
frosts
are
over
in
rows
eight
feet
apart
each
way
that
distance
will
leave
none
too
much
room
for
letting
in
the
sun
and
for
the
convenience
of
picking
they
will
mature
on
the
poorest
land
but
the
amount
of
the
crop
is
graduated
altogether
by
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
the
care
given
them
they
will
produce
frequently
a
bushel
to
a
vine
lying
on
the
ground
but
they
ripen
better
and
as
the
vines
are
not
injured
by
picking
the
early
ones
they
will
produce
more
by
being
trained
up
a
few
sticks
to
hold
them
up
at
first
and
let
them
break
down
over
them
later
is
of
no
use
train
them
and
tie
up
all
the
principal
bunches
and
they
will
be
greatly
benefited
thereby
tied
to
slats
or
any
board
fence
in
a
kind
of
form
they
do
very
well
in
all
cities
and
villages
enough
for
a
large
family
can
be
grown

go
into

agricultural

there
are
constant
changes
and
improvements
and
they
are
introduced
at
once

the
whole

we
also
wish
to
avoid
all
participation
in
the
controversies
respecting
the
merits
of
various
new
inventions
we
have
several
forms
of
cultivators
drills
and
drainers
various
formed
plows

possess
different
degrees
of
merit

have
their

never
lay
them
down

in

proper

and
always
clean
them
before

facilitate
and
cheapen
cultivation
and
increase
the
yield
of

money
paid
out
for
such
tools
is
well
expended
training
this
is
a
matter
that
has
received
much
attention
from
all
the
influence
of
different
modes
of
training
and
pruning
is
very
great
on
the
bearing
qualities
of
trees
the
peculiarities
demanded
by
the
various
vines
and
bushes
are
given
under
these
articles
respectively
we
give
here
only
some
general
principles
the
health
beauty
and
profit
of
most
depend
upon
judicious
pruning
and
training
the
following
are
the
general
objects
to
secure
regular
growth
and
prevent
deformities
and
thus
promote
the
health
of
trees
to
secure
a
sufficient
number
of
shoots
and
in
right
locations
and
to
throw
sufficient
sap
into
those
shoots
to
enable
them
to
mature
the
fruit
with
a
certain
amount
of
pruning
you
may
double
the
quantity
of
fruit
or
destroy
half
that
the
trees
would
have
produced
if
not
trained
at
all
one
half
of
the
fruit
of
any
orchard
depends
upon
correct
pruning
it
also
has
a
great
influence
upon
the
quality
of
fruit
the
cherry
is
almost
the
only
that
throws
out
nearly
the
right
number
of
branches
and
in
the
right
places
it
needs
a
very
little
direction
while
young
and
afterward
only
the
removal
of
decaying
branches
the
quince
needs
considerable
trimming
at
first
but
the
head
once
formed
it
will
need
very
little
next
comes
the
plum
needing
perhaps
a
little
more
pruning
than
the
cherry
or
quince
but
much
less
than
the
other
fruits
the
plum
is
apt
to
throw
out
strong
branches
in
some
directions
quite
out
of
proportion
with
the
rest
of
the
top
such
need
shortening
in
to
distribute
the
sap
equally
through
the
tree
and
thus
produce
a
symmetrical
form
this
is
all
the
trimming
necessary
the
roots
of
a
are
usually
stronger
than
the
top
and
absorb
more
than
the
leaves
can
digest
hence
some
of
its
diseases
the
natural
remedy
would
be
and
leaving
the
top
in
its
natural
state
except
the
disproportioned
branches
removing
much
of
the
top
of
a
would
ordinarily
prove
injurious
the
apple
needs
considerable
pruning
but
not
of
the
spurs
and
which
bear
the
fruit
but
of
limbs
that
grow
too
thick
and
of
disproportioned
luxuriance
see
under
apple
so
the
pear
must
be
often
slightly
pruned
to
check
the
too
vigorous
growth
and
encourage
the
too
tardy
the
peach
must
be
so
pruned
as
to
prevent
the
long
bare
poles
so
often
seen
and
to
secure
annually
the
growth
of
a
large
number
of
shoots
for
next
year
bearing
and
to
check
the
flow
of
the
sap
by
cutting
off
the
ends
of
the
growing
young
shoots
so
as
to
cause
the
formation
on
each
of
a
few
vigorous
so
pruned
will
be
healthy
and
do
well
for
fifty
years
and
produce
a
larger
number
of
better
peaches
than
will
grow
on
trees
left
in
the
usual
way
by
a
system
of
pruning
that
will
equalize
the
growth
and
strength
the
bearing
will
be
general
on
all
the
branches
of
the
tree
this
will
make
the
fruit
more
abundant
and
of
better
quality
the
following
six
principles
first
stated
by
dubreuil
of
france
and
since
presented
to
the
american
people
in
barry
and
still
later
in
elliott
will
guide
any
attentive
cultivator
into
the
correct
method
of
pruning
and
training
the
vigor
of
a
tree
subject
to
pruning
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
equal
distribution
of
sap
in
all
its
branches
the
sap
acts
with
greater
force
and
produces
more
vigorous
growth
on
a
branch
pruned
short
than
on
one
pruned
long
the
sap
tending
always
to
the
extremities
causes
the
terminal
shoots
to
push
with
more
vigor
than
the
laterals
the
more
the
sap
is
obstructed
in
its
circulation
the
more
likely
it
will
be
to
produce
the
leaves
serve
to
prepare
the
sap
for
the
nourishment
of
the
tree
and
to
aid
in
the
formation
of
therefore
trees
deprived
of
their
foliage
are
liable
to
perish
and
they
are
injured
in
proportion
to
their
defoliation
when
the
buds
of
any
shoot
or
branch
do
not
develop
before
the
age
of
two
years
they
can
only
be
forced
into
activity
by
very
close
pruning
and
this
will
often
fail
especially
in
the
peach
observe
the
foregoing
and
never
cut
large
limbs
from
any
tree
except
in
grafting
an
old
tree
and
then
only
graft
a
part
of
the
top
in
one
year
especially
in
the
pear
and
of
old
neglected
to
renew
the
top
and
any
careful
cultivator
can
raise
an
orchard
of
healthy
beautiful
and
profitable
trees

are
different
forms
of
training
that
have
gone
the
rounds

horizontal

another
form
contributing

are
valuable
for
fruits
that
need
winter
protection

they
are
also
very
ornamental

enable
us
to
cultivate
much
fruit

a
small

all
these
forms
of
training
increase
largely

recommended

transplanting
trees
should
be
transplanted
in
spring
in
cold
climates
and
in
autumn
in
warm
regions
the
top
should
be
lessened
about
as
much
as
the
roots
have
been
by
removal
cutting
off
so
large
a
part
of
the
top
as
we
often
see
is
greatly
injurious
trees
frequently
lose
one
or
two
growth
by
being
excessively
trimmed
when
transplanted
the
leaves
are
the
lungs
of
the
tree
and
how
can
it
grow
if
they
are
mostly
removed
all
injured
roots
should
be
cut
off
smoothly
on
the
lower
side
slant
out
from
the
tree
and
just
above
the
point
of
injury
places
for
the
trees
should
be
prepared
as
given
under
the
different
fruits
and
the
trees
set
firmly
in
them
an
inch
lower
than
they
stood
in
the
nursery
the
great
point
is
to
get
the
fine
mould
very
close
around
all
the
roots
leaving
them
in
the
most
natural
position
trees
dipped
in
a
bucket
of
soil
or
clay
and
water
thick
enough
to
form
a
coat
like
paint
just
at
the
time
of
transplanting
are
said
to
be
less
liable
to
die
every
transplanted
tree
should
have
a
stake
and
be
thoroughly
mulched
trees
properly
transplanted
will
grow
much
faster
and
bear
a
year
or
two
earlier

those
that
have
been
carelessly
set
out
for
further
remarks
on
this
important
matter
see
under
the
different
fruits
turnip
this
is
one
of
the
great
root
crops
of
england
and
to
considerable
extent
in
this
country
for
feeding
purposes
we
think
it
should
be
displaced
mostly
by
beets
carrots
and
parsnips
they
are
more
nutritious
as
easily
raised
and
more
conveniently
fed
the
rutabaga
is
a
productive
variety
and
possesses
a
good
deal
of
nutriment
the
essentials
in
raising
good
turnips
of
most
varieties
are
very
rich
soil
worked
deep
and
finely
pulverized
they
should
stand
in
rows
two
feet
apart
and
one
foot
apart
in
the
rows
they
may
be
mainly
tended
with
a
small
cultivator
or
english
turnips
are
extensively
grown
as
a
second
crop
on
wheat
stubble
the
soil
is
highly
enriched
and
the
seed
sown
in
rows
to
allow
cultivation
the
best
method
however
is
to
turn
over
old
greensward
say
june
and
yard
cattle
or
sheep
on
it
till
july
and
then
harrow
thoroughly
and
sow
the
seed
broadcast
the
yield
will
usually
be
large
and
they
will
need
very
little
weeding
if
it
is
not
convenient
to
yard
cattle
on
the
apply
fifteen
double
wagon
loads
of
fine
manure
with
a
few
bushels
of
lime
to
the
acre
and
the
crop
will
be
large
the
usual
time
of
sowing
turnips
is
from
the
to
the
of
july
we
think
the
yield
is
larger
when
sown
by
the
middle
of
june
the
only
way
to
get
good
early
turnips
is
to
sow
them
very
early
the
flat
or
common
field
turnip
is
easily
grown
on
new
land
or
on
any
rich
soil
tolerably
free
from
weeds
and
not
infested
with
worms
wheat
this
is
the
most
highly
esteemed
of
all
grains
and
has
more
enemies
and
is
more
affected
in
its
growth
by
the
weather
than
any
other
it
has
engaged
more
attention
in
the
study
and
writings
of
agriculturists
than
all
other
cereals
the
outlines
only
of
the
results
of
the
vast
field
of
investigation
and
experiment
on
can
be
presented
here
there
are
doubts
respecting
the
origin
of
wheat
the
more
general
and
probable
theory
is
that
it
is
the
product
of
the
cultivation
for
a
series
of
years
of
a
species
of
grass
called
√¶gilops
this
is
indigenous
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
in
those
countries
which
from
time
immemorial
have
been
the
sources
of
our
wheat
no
one
has
ever
found
wild
wheat
in
any
country
it
would
be
as
strange
as
a
wild
cabbage
or
turnip
but
the
practical
question
is
how
can
wheat
be
most
surely
and
profitably
grown
the
first
requisite
is
a
suitable
soil
a
clay
or
limestone
soil
is
usually
considered
best
as
there
is
much
lime
in
such
soil
is
better
than
light
sand
or
some
of
the
poorer
loams
but
the
large
yields
of
wheat
on
the
western
prairies
and
on
the
rich
alluvial
soils
of
california
shows
that
the
best
of
wheat
may
grow
on
other
than
clay
lands
the
truth
of
the
matter
respecting
soils
for
wheat
is
that
any
soil
good
for
corn
potatoes
or
a
garden
may
with
proper
tillage
produce
the
best
of
wheat
experience
in
england
and
in
all
the
old
countries
on
the
continent
of
europe
shows
us
that
old
land
may
be
made
to
yield
as
large
crops
of
wheat
as
the
virgin
soil
of
the
new
world
the
production
of
wheat
at
suitable
intervals
for
a
century
on
the
same
land
need
not
lessen
its
power
to
produce
good
wheat
in
large
quantities
wheat
is
a
plant
demanding
a
rich
soil
worked
deep
and
not
too
wet
these
three
things
will
produce
a
good
crop
on
any
land
we
say
to
all
farmers
raise
wheat
on
any
land
that
you
can
afford
to
prepare
first
if
your
land
has
not
a
dry
subsoil
underdrain
it
thoroughly
water
standing
in
the
soil
and
becoming
cold
or
stagnant
is
very
injurious
to
wheat
drainage
is
hardly
more
essential
to
any
other
crop
than
this
next
plow
deep
subsoiling
on
most
lands
is
very
important
to
wheat
manure
highly
and
put
the
manure
between
the
soil
and
the
subsoil
this
attracts
the
roots
deep
into
the
soil
which
is
the
greatest
protection
against
and
the
effects
of
excessive
drought
render
the
surface
of
the
soil
as
fine
as
possible
a
soil
is
as
essential
for
wheat
as
for
onions
coarse
lumpy
soils
are
so
open
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
as
to
render
the
growth
unequal
and
cause
the
roots
of
the
plant
to
grow
too
near
the
surface
for
dry
weather
or
the
cold
of
winter
always
apply
lime
to
unless
it
be
a
limestone
soil
not
too
much
at
once
but
a
few
bushels
to
the
acre

no
other
crop

dissolved
potash

pay
so
well
as
on
wheat
sowing
the
seed
is
next
in
importance
the
three
questions
in
sowing
are
the
manner
the
depth
and
the
quantity
shall
it
be
drilled
or
sowed
broadcast
broadcast
sowing
requires
more
seed
and
is
liable
to
be
less
evenly
covered
hence
we
should
prefer
drilling
the
depth
of
the
seed
is
to
be
determined
by
the
texture
of
the
soil
careful
experiments
have
shown
that
on
clay
land
there
is
no
perceptible
difference
in
the
growth
of
the
plants
at
any
of
the
stages
in
seed
sown
at
any
depth
from
a
slight
covering
to
three
or
four
inches
at
a
greater
depth
it
comes
up
less
regularly
and
in
every
way
is
in
a
worse
condition
but
on
a
light
soil
it
is
no
doubt
best
to
plant
it
from
four
to
six
inches
deep
on
very
loose
soils
as
muck
land
and
alluvial
soils
the
roots
of
the
plants
grow
too
near
the
surface
and
are
exposed
to
being
thrown
out
by
winter
frosts
and
destroyed
the
remedy
is
deep
sowing
and
thorough
rolling
the
quantity
of
seed
now
more
generally
sown
is
from
five
pecks
to
two
bushels
per
acre
rich
land
will
not
bear
so
much
seed
as
the
poorer
it
will
grow
so
thick
as
to
render
the
straw
tender
and
expose
it
to
lodge
and
ruin
the
crop
wheat
tillers
or
thickens
up
at
the
bottom
making
many
stalks
from
a
single
seed
quite
as
much
as
any
other
grain
hence
we
believe
that
if
it
be
sown
at
a
proper
time
on
very
rich
land
three
pecks
to
the
acre
would
be
better
than
more
such
sowing
would
make
more
vigorous
plants
with
much
stronger
roots
which
would
withstand
cold
and
unfavorable
weather
better
than
any
other
we
should
still
more
strongly
recommend
another
form
of
sowing
practised
by
some
european
cultivators
with
great
success
it
is
to
drill
in
wheat
in
rows
two
feet
apart
and
give
it
a
spring
cultivation
this
gives
great
strength
to
the
plants
destroys
the
weeds
promotes
rapid
growth
by
stirring
the
soil
and
favors
tillering
so
that
the
rows
will
meet
and
give
a
great
growth
we
doubt
not
this
will
yet
be
extensively
adopted
in
this
country
all
had
better
be
rolled
after
sowing
and
light
lands
with
a
very
heavy
roller
light
sandy
land
having
a
little
clay
mixed
in
as
recommended
under
soils
well
manured
the
seed
planted
six
inches
deep
and
the
whole
rolled
with
a
heavy
roller
will
bear
great
crops
of
wheat
as
it
respects
fall
or
spring
wheat
no
positive
directions
can
be
given
adapted
to
all
climates
in
many
localities
it
is
of
little
use
to
sow
winter
wheat
as
it
is
very
uncertain
in
other
localities
winter
wheat
almost
always
succeeds
best
this
question
then
must
be
determined
by
circumstances
the
time
of
sowing
winter
wheat
varies
in
different
climates
according
as
it
may
be
exposed
to
depredations
of
worms
and
insects
in
the
fall
farmers
are
not
liable
to
mistake
in
this
matter
spring
wheat
in
all
climates
should
be
sowed
very
early
it
is
hardly
possible
in
all
the
middle
and
northern
states
to
prepare
the
ground
in
spring
and
get
in
wheat
in
suitable
season
the
yield
of
a
crop
of
spring
wheat
depends
materially
upon
the
growth
in
the
cool
and
moist
weather
of
spring
when
it
spreads
and
its
roots
get
a
strong
hold
before
the
hot
weather
that
hurries
up
the
stalks
and
ears
to
maturity
hence
plow
in
the
fall
and
harrow
in
the
wheat
as
early
as
possible
in
the
spring
of
wheat
are
numerous
and
uncertain
in
the
state
of
maine
an
intelligent
cultivator
in
recommended
java
wheat
as
having
a
very
stiff
straw
and
producing
a
very
heavy
yield
the
mediterranean
wheat
is
also
a
favorite
variety
club
wheat
has
also
had
a
great
run
and
is
now
very
popular
at
the
west
but
of
varieties
no
one
can
be
confident
we
notice
in
the
discussions
of
the
best
agriculturists
of
england
and
scotland
that
they
have
doubts
of
the
proper
names
of
some
of
the
best
varieties
in
a
certain
rich
part
of
illinois
we
know
an
unusually
popular
wheat
sold
at
high
prices
for
seed
under
the
name
of
as
being
much
better
than
the
ordinary
club
we
happened
to
learn
that
it
was
nothing
but
common
club
wheat
sown
on
rather
low
ground
where
it
happened
to
grow
very
fair
that
season
it
is
only
occasionally
that
such
tricks
are
successfully
played
but
it
is
true
that
many
varieties
are
the
result
of
extra
good
or
chance
cultivation
the
celebrated
chidham
wheat
named
from
a
place
where
it
was
successfully
grown
was
also
called
hedge
wheat
because
a
head
found
growing
in
a
hedge
was
supposed
to
be
the
origin
of
it
now
it
is
not
probable
that
that
head
was
the
only
one
of
the
kind
in
all
the
country
and
it
would
by
no
means
be
identified
in
all
localities
and
as
all
wheat
is
the
result
of
the
cultivation
of
the
√¶gilops
or
some
other
wild
grass
it
shows
us
that
varieties
may
be
produced
by
cultivation
great
importance
is
therefore
to
be
attached
to
frequently
changing
seed
especially
bringing
it
from
colder
into
warmer
climates
and
changing
from
one
soil
to
a
very
different
one
thus
seed
raised
on
hard
hills
is
highly
valuable
for
alluvial
soils
thus
the
efforts
to
introduce
so
many
new
varieties
from
the
dominions
of
the
sultan
will
prove
of
vast
advantage
to
wheat
culture
in
america
so
let
us
be
constantly
importing
the
best
from
great
britain
and
the
british
provinces
and
from
california
and
all
the
extremes
of
our
own
country
such
wheats
are
worth
more
for
seeds
than
others
but
any
extravagant
prices
for
seed
wheat
under
the
idea
of
almost
miraculous
powers
of
production
are
unwise
it
would
be
useless
to
go
into
a
more
extended
notice
of
varieties
as
some
do
best
in
certain
localities
and
all
are
rapidly
spread
through
the
dealers
and
by
the
influence
of
agricultural
periodicals
the
best
time
to
harvest
wheat
is
when
the
straw
below
the
head
has
turned
yellow
and
the
grain
is
so
far
out
of
the
milk
as
not
to
be
easily
mashed
between
the
fingers
but
before
it
has
become
hard
the
grain
is
heavier
and
of
better
quality
and
wastes
far
less
in
harvesting
than
when
allowed
to
ripen
and
dry
standing
in
the
field
drying
in
good
shocks
is
far
better
than
drying
before
cut
some
have
gone
to
extremes
in
early
cutting
and
harvested
their
wheat
while
in
the
milk
and
suffered
serious
loss
in
its
weight
we
sometimes
have
rain
in
harvest
which
causes
all
the
wheat
in
a
large
region
to
grow
before
getting
it
dry
enough
to
house
a
remedy
is
to
go
right
on
and
cut
your
wheat
rain
or
shine
and
put
it
up
without
binding
in
large
cocks
of
from
three
to
five
bushels
packing
together
as
close
as
possible
however
wet
and
cover
the
centre
with
a
bundle
of
wheat
to
shed
rain
it
will
dry
out
without
growing
and
although
the
straw
will
be
somewhat
mouldy
the
grain
will
be
perfectly
good
even
when
it
has
been
so
wet
as
to
make
the
top
of
the
shocks
perfectly
green
with
grown
wheat
this
process
is
of
great
value
in
a
wet
season
to
prepare
for
sowing
soak
it
for
a
day
or
two
in
very
strong
brine
skim
off
all
that
rises
remove
the
grain
from
the
brine
and
while
wet
sift
on
lime
until
it
slightly
coats
the
whole
grain
put
on
a
little
plaster
to
render
the
sowing
more
pleasant
to
the
hand
wheat
will
lie
in
this
condition
for
days
without
injury
so
prepared
it
will
exhibit
a
marked
superiority
in
the
growing
crop
of
wheat
are
numerous
and
various
remedies
are
proposed
the
is
sometimes
very
destructive
wheat
planted
with
a
drill
with
a
heavy
roller
behind
each
tooth
will
not
suffer
by
them
they
will
only
work
in
the
mellow
ground
between
the
drills
drive
over
a
field
of
wheat
exposed
to
injury
from
with
a
common
and
you
will
notice
a
marked
difference
wherever
the
cartwheel
passed
over
the
wheat
remains
unharmed
by
the
while
on
either
side
much
of
it
will
be
destroyed
but
the
or
weevil
is
the
great
enemy
rendering
the
cultivation
of
wheat
in
some
localities
useless
one
precaution
is
to
get
the
wheat
forward
so
early
and
fast
as
to
have
it
out
of
the
way
before
they
destroy
it
this
is
often
done
by
early
sowing
high
fertilization
and
warm
land
sometimes
wheat
is
too
late
for
them
and
then
a
good
crop
is
secured
but
this
can
only
be
relied
on
in
cool
moist
climates
our
hot
dry
seasons
are
not
suitable
for
wheat
late
enough
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
weevil
the
great
remedy
for
this
enemy
is
his
destruction
burning
the
chaff
at
thrashing
is
useless
for
this
purpose
the
worm
has
entered
the
ground
to
remain
for
the
winter
before
the
wheat
is
harvested
we
know
of
but
one
way
to
kill
the
weevil
and
that
is
by
insect
lamps
or
torches
in
the
field
in
the
evening
the
flies
are
inactive
until
evening
when
from
dusk
till
eight
or
nine
they
deposite
their
eggs
in
the
blossoms
and
chaff
of
the
wheat
now
it
is
ascertained
that
this
fly
like
many
other
insects
will
fly
several
rods
to
a
light
torches
at
equal
distances
in
a
lot
of
wheat
would
be
near
enough
nearly
all
the
flies
in
a
field
would
fly
to
them
in
half
an
hour
these
need
be
lighted
only
on
pleasant
evenings
as
weevils
will
not
work
in
wind
or
rain
and
they
only
commit
their
depredations
during
the
time
the
wheat
is
in
blossom
let
racks
or
holders
of
some
kind
be
put
up
on
ten
acres
of
wheat
and
have
put
in
them
and
ignited
after
the
manner
of
night
fishermen
and
let
this
be
done
a
few
nights
during
the
blossoming
season
of
wheat
and
the
fly
will
be
destroyed
and
the
crop
saved
in
the
worst
that
ever
occurred
in
the
absence
of
some
other
light
can
be
devised
as
balls
of
rags
dipped
in
turpentine
and
sulphur
as
in
a
torchlight
procession
something
can
be
devised
that
will
burn
brilliantly
for
an
hour
this
will
not
cost
fifty
cents
an
acre
during
the
and
will
prove
almost
a
perfect
remedy
rust
in
wheat
is
only
avoided
by
getting
your
wheat
to
maturity
before
the
rust
strikes
it
if
it
is
nearly
mature
and
the
rust
strikes
it
cut
it
and
shock
it
up

the
shortest
time
possible
wheat
is
a
great
subject
in
agriculture
on
which
many
volumes
have
been
written
and
on
which
it
is
customary
to
write
long
articles
we
trust
the
recapitulation
of
what
we
have
said

more
valuable

wine
we
have
elsewhere
stated
that
our
only
hope
for
pure
wine
in
this
country
is
in
domestic
manufacture
we
shall
here
give
two
recipes
that
will
insure
better
articles
than
are
now
offered
under
the
name
of
imported
wines
this
as
usually
manufactured
is
a
mere
cordial
rather
than
a
wine
the
following
recipe
gathered
from
the
is
all
that
need
be
desired
on
making
wine
from
currants
cherries
and
most
berries
that
are
not
too
sweet
take
clean
ripe
currants
and
pass
them
between
two
rollers
or
in
some
other
way
crush
them
put
them
in
a
strong
bag
and
under
a
screw
or
weight
and
the
juice
will
be
easily
expressed
to
each
quart
of
this
juice
add
three
pounds
of
loaf
sugar
no
other
sugar
will
do
and
water
enough
to
make
a
gallon
or
in
a
cask
that
will
hold
thirty
gallons
put
thirty
quarts
of
the
juice
ninety
pounds
of
the
sugar
and
fill
to
the
bung
with
water
put
in
the
bung
and
roll
the
cask
until
you
can
not
hear
the
sugar
moving
on
the
inside
of
the
barrel
when
it
will
all
be
dissolved
next
day
roll
it
again
and
place
it
in
a
cellar
of
very
even
temperature
and
leave
the
bung
out
to
allow
fermentation
this
will
commence
in
two
or
three
days
and
continue
for
a
few
weeks
its
presence
may
be
known
by
a
slight
noise
like
that
of
soda
water
which
may
be
heard
by
placing
the
ear
at
the
bung
hole
when
this
ceases
drive
the
bung
tight
and
let
it
stand
six
months
when
the
wine
may
be
drawn
off
and
bottled
and
will
be
perfectly
clear
and
not
too
sweet
no
alcohol
should
be
added
putting
in
brandies
or
other
spirituous
liquors
prevents
the
fermentation
of
wine
leaving
the
mixture
a
mere
cordial
the
use
of
any
but
sugar
is
always
injurious
and
yet
many
will
persist
in
using
it
because
it
is
cheaper
the
reason
for
discarding
for
all
but
sugar
may
be
easily
understood
common
sugar
contains
one
half
of
one
per
cent
of
gum
that
becomes
fetid
on
being
dissolved
in
water
the
quantity
of
this
gum
in
the
sugar
for
a
barrel
of
wine
is
considerable
enough
to
give
a
bad
flavor
to
the
wine
this
is
avoided
by
using
sugar
which
contains
no
gum
this
recipe
is
equally
good
for
cherry
wine
the
following
recipe
for
making
produces
an
article
that
the
best
judges
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
have
pronounced
equal
to
any
imported
wine
its
excellence
has
made
quite
a
market
for
elderberries
in
new
york
these
berries
are
so
easily
grown
and
the
wine
so
excellent
that
their
growth
will
be
encouraged
throughout
the
country
it
is
not
only
an
exceedingly
palatable
wine
but
is
better
for
the
sick
than
any
other
known
to
every
quart
of
the
berries
put
a
quart
of
water
and
boil
for
half
an
hour
bruise
them
from
the
skin
and
strain
and
to
every
gallon
of
the
juice
add
three
pounds
of
sugar
and
one
quarter
of
an
ounce
of
cream
of
tartar
and
boil
for
half
an
hour
take
a
clean
cask
and
put
in
it
one
pound
of
raisins
to
every
three
gallons
of
the
wine
and
a
slice
of
toasted
bread
covered
over
with
good
yeast
when
the
wine
has
become
quite
cool
put
it
into
the
cask
and
place
it
in
a
room
of
even
temperature
to
ferment
when
the
fermentation
has
fully
ceased
put
the
bung
in
tight
no
brandy
or
alcohol
of
any
kind
will
be
necessary
any
one
following
this
recipe
will
be
surprised
at
the
excellence
of
the
wine
that
will
be
the
result
of
there
are
several
varieties
whose
peculiarities
are
determined
mainly
by
the
process
of
manufacturing
a
full
treatment
of
the
subject
would
require
a
volume
the
following
brief
directions
will
insure
success
in
making
the
most
desirable
grape
wines
let
the
grapes
become
thoroughly
ripe
before
gathering
to
increase
their
saccharine
qualities
and
make
a
stronger
wine
all
fruits
make
much
better
wine
for
being
fully
ripe
cut
the
bunches
with
a
sharp
knife
and
move
carefully
to
avoid
bruising
spread
them
in
a
dry
shade
to
evaporate
excessive
moisture
assort
the
grapes
before
using
removing
all
decayed
green
or
broken
ones
using
only
perfect
berries
mash
the
grapes
with
a
beater
in
a
tub
or
by
passing
them
through
a
the
wine
was
the
ancient
method
of
mashing
the
grapes
not
now
practised
except
in
some
parts
of
europe
to
make
light
wines
put
them
at
once
into
press
as
apple
pomace
in
a
to
make
wines
let
the
pomace
stand
from
four
to
hours
before
pressing
they
will
be
dark
in
proportion
to
the
length
of
time
the
pomace
stands
to
make
wines
resembling
the
austere
wines
of
france
and
spain
let
the
pomace
stand
until
the
first
fermentation
is
over
called
fermenting
in
the
skin
the
must
or
is
to
be
put
into
casks
the
larger
the
better
but
only
one
pressing
should
be
put
into
one
cask
put
in
a
cellar
of
even
temperature
not
lower
than
fifty
nor
higher
than
degrees
of
fahrenheit
and
where
there
is
plenty
of
air
prepare
the
cask
by
burning
in
it
a
strip
of
paper
or
muslin
dipped
in
melted
sulphur
and
suspended
by
a
wire
across
the
fermentation
commences
very
soon
and
will
be
completed
within
a
few
days
or
weeks
according
to
the
temperature
its
completion
is
marked
by
the
cessation
of
the
escape
of
gas
no
sugar
brandy
or
any
other
substance
should
be
added
to
the
to
make
good
wine
they
are
all
adulterations
the
wine
having
settled
after
this
fermentation
may
be
racked
off
into
clean
casks
prepared
as
before
a
second
fermentation
will
take
place
in
the
spring
it
should
not
be
bottled
until
after
this
second
fermentation
as
its
expansion
will
break
the
glass
while
in
the
casks
they
should
always
be
kept
full
being
occasionally
filled
from
a
small
cask
kept
for
the
purpose
when
this
fermentation
ceases
bottle
and
cork
tight
and
lay
the
bottles
on
their
sides
in
a
cool
cellar
the
wine
will
improve
with
age
sometimes
it
remains
on
the
lees
without
racking
and
is
drawn
off
and
bottled
frequently
the
wine
does
not
become
wholly
clear
and
needs
fining
various
substances
are
used
for
this
purpose
as
charcoal
starch
rice
milk
the
best
of
these
substances
is
charcoal
or
the
white
of
eggs
and
milk
add
by
degrees
according
to
the
foulness
of
the
wine
an
ounce
of
charcoal
to
a
barrel
of
wine
is
an
ordinary
quantity
or
a
pint
of
milk
with
the
white
of
four
eggs
more
or
less
according
to
the
state
of
the
wine
of
germany
may
be
made
as
follows
take
good
catawba
or
isabella
grapes
and
pound
or
grind
them
so
as
to
crush
every
seed
and
leave
them
in
that
state
for
hours
fumigate
the
cask
by
burning
strips
of
muslin
dipped
in
sulphur
as
in
the
preceding
recipe
strain
or
press
out
the
juice
into
the
cask
filling
it
and
keeping
it
that
impurities
may
run
out
of
the
bung
during
fermentation
in
the
spring
prepare
another
cask
in
the
same
way
and
rack
it
off
into
that
when
a
year
old
bottle
it
and
it
is
fit
for
use
sweeter
wines
than
any
of
the
above
are
made
by
adding
sugar
to
the
must
before
fermentation
it
should
be
sugar
and
still
it
is
an
adulteration
woodlands
one
of
the
greatest
errors
of
american
farmers
is
their
neglect
to
cultivate
groves
of
trees
for
woodlands
in
all
suitable
places
our
primeval
forests
have
been
wantonly
destroyed
and
the
country
is
not
yet
old
enough
to
feel
the
full
force
of
neglecting
to
replenish
them
by
new
groves
in
suitable
localities
on
the
points
of
hills
rough
stony
places
sides
of
steep
hills
ravines
that
can
not
be
cultivated
and
by
the
side
of
all
the
highways
of
the
land
trees
should
be
cultivated
in
some
places
but
in
most
places
the
advantages
would
be
manifold
they
would
afford
shade
for
cattle
groves
for
birds
which
would
destroy
the
worms
they
would
break
off
the
cold
winds
from
crops
cattle
and
dwellings
would
greatly
enrich
the
soil
by
their
annual
foliage
afford
abundance
of
fuel
at
the
cheapest
rates
give
much
good
timber
provide
for
fine
and
be
the
greatest
ornaments
of
the
rural
districts
only
think
of
the
comfort
and
beauty
of
fifty
miles
square
in
which
not
a
street
could
be
found
which
had
not
trees
on
each
side
not
more
than
twelve
feet
apart
when
such
trees
should
become
twenty
years
old
the
pedestrian
or
the
carriage
could
move
all
day
in
the
shade
listening
to
the
music
of
the
birds
and
inhaling
the
aroma
of
the
foliage
or
flowers
to
every
owner
or
occupant
of
the
soil
we
say
plant
trees
poultry
fattening
and
preparing
poultry
for
the
market
are
important
items
in
rural
economy
plenty
of
sweet
food
and
pure
water
given
at
regular
times
and
the
fowls
not
allowed
to
wander
are
the
requisites
of
successful
fattening
the
best
feed
for
fattening
fowls
is
next
to
this
is
three
things
are
essential
in
food
for
fattening
animals
and
substances
of
all
the
grains
ordinarily
fed
contains
these
in
the
best
proportions
and
next
to
this
comes
yellow
indian
corn
meal
fat
is
good
but
must
be
given
in
a
hard
form
as
in
mutton
or
beef
suet
rice
boiled
in
sweet
milk
fed
for
a
day
or
two
before
killing
fowls
is
said
to
render
the
flesh
of
a
white
delicate
color
at
least
one
third
of
the
value
of
poultry
in
the
market
depends
upon
properly
preparing
and
transporting
it
do
not
feed
fowls
at
all
for
hours
before
killing
them
kill
by
cutting
the
jugular
vein
with
a
sharp
just
under
the
sides
of
the
head
and
hang
them
up
to
bleed
pick
carefully
and
very
clean
without
tearing
the
skin
and
without
scalding
singe
slightly
if
need
be
dip
in
hot
water
for
three
or
four
seconds
and
in
cold
water
half
a
minute
do
not
open
the
breast
at
all
but
remove
the
entrails
from
the
hind
opening
leaving
the
gizzard
in
its
place
put
no
water
in
but
wipe
out
the
blood
with
a
dry
cloth
leaving
the
entrails
in
is
injurious
tending
to
sour
the
meat
and
taint
it
with
their
flavor
do
not
allow
your
poultry
to
freeze
by
any
means
for
transporting
to
a
distant
market
pack
in
shallow
boxes
never
containing
over
three
hundred
pounds
each
and
in
clean
straw
without
chaff
or
dust
and
in
such
a
manner
that
no
two
fowls
will
touch
each
other
geese
and
ducks
look
better
with
the
heads
cut
off
but
all
fowls
having
their
heads
removed
must
have
the
skin
drawn
down
and
tightly
tied
over
the
end
of
the
neck
bone
this
will
preserve
them
well
and
give
a
good
appearance
to
preserve
fowls
for
a
long
time
in
a
perfectly
sweet
condition
for
family
use
fill
them
half
full
or
more
with
pulverized
charcoal
which
will
act
as
an
absorbent
and
prevent
every
particle
of
taint
