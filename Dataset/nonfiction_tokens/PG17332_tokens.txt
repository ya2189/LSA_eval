ideal

in

of

louis
in
egypt
the
mamluks
the
traditional
history
of
the
christian
church
has
generally
maintained
that
the
crusades
were
due
solely
to
religious
influence
and
sprang
from
ideal
and
moral
motives
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
warriors
who
went
out
to
the
east
were
religious
enthusiasts
prompted
by
the
pious
longings
of
their
hearts
and
peter
the
hermit
it
was
claimed
had
received
a
divine
message
to
call
christendom
to
arms
to
preach
a
crusade
against
the
unbelievers
and
take
possession
of
the
holy
sepulchre
that
such
ideal
reasons
should
be
attributed
to
a
war
like
the
crusades
of
a
wide
and
influence
on
the
political
and
intellectual
development
of
mediæval
europe
is
not
at
all
surprising
in
the
history
of
humanity
there
have
been
few
wars
in
which
the
combatants
on
both
sides
were
not
convinced
that
they
had
drawn
their
swords
for
some
noble
purpose
for
the
cause
of
right
and
justice
that
the
motives
prompting
the
vast
display
of
arms
witnessed
during
the
crusades
that
the
wanderings
of
those
crowds
to
the
east
during
two
centuries
and
the
cruelties
committed
by
the
saintly
warriors
on
their
way
to
the
holy
sepulchre
should
be
attributed
exclusively
to
ideal
and
religious
sources
is
therefore
quite
natural
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
there
was
a
religious
factor
in
the
crusades
but
that
the
religious
motive
was
not
the
sole
incentive
has
now
been
agreed
upon
by
impartial
historians
and
in
so
far
as
the
motives
animating
the
crusaders
were
religious
motives
we
are
to
look
to
powerful
influences
which
gradually
made
themselves
felt
from
without
the
ecclesiastical
organisations
it
was
by
no
means
a
movement
which
the
church
alone
had
called
into
being
on
the
contrary
only
when
the
movement
had
grown
ripe
did
gregory
vii
hasten
to
take
steps
to
enable
the
church
to
control
it
the
idea
of
a
crusade
for
the
glory
of
religion
had
not
sprung
from
the
tenets
of
christianity
it
was
given
to
mediaeval
europe
by
the
muhammedans
history
can
hardly
boast
of
another
example
of
so
gigantic
a
conquest
during
so
short
a
period
as
that
gained
by
the
first
adherents
of
islam
like
the
fiery
wind
of
the
desert
they
had
broken
from
their
retreats
animated
by
the
promises
of
the
prophet
and
spread
the
new
doctrine
far
and
wide
in
the
scimitar
of
the
saracens
enclosed
an
area
as
large
as
the
roman
empire
under
the
cæsars
barely
forty
years
elapsed
after
the
death
of
the
prophet
when
the
armies
of
islam
reached
the
atlantic
okba
the
wild
and
gallant
leader
rode
into
the
sea
on
the
western
shore
of
africa
and
whilst
the
seething
waves
reached
to
the
saddle
of
his
camel
he
exclaimed
i
call
thee
as
witness
that
i
should
have
carried
the
knowledge
of
thy
name
still
farther
if
these
waves
threatening
to
swallow
me
would
not
have
prevented
me
from
doing
not
long
after
this
the
flag
of
the
crescent
was
waving
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
chinese
mountains
in
the
saracens
under
general
tarik
crossed
the
straits
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
atlantic
and
landed
on
the
rock
which
has
since
been
called
after
him
hill
of
tarik
jebel
or
gibraltar
spain
was
invaded
and
captured
by
the
moslems
for
awhile
it
seemed
as
if
on
the
other
side
of
the
garonne
the
crescent
would
also
supplant
the
cross
and
only
the
victory
of
charles
martel
in
put
a
stop
to
the
wave
of
muhammedan
conquest
thus
in
a
brief
period
muhammedanism
spread
from
the
nile
valley
to
the
mediterranean
trenchant
argument
was
the
sword
he
gave
a
distinct
command
to
his
followers
to
convince
the
infidels
of
the
power
of
truth
on
the
sword
is
a
surer
argument
than
books
he
said
accordingly
the
koran
ordered
war
against
unbelievers
sword
is
the
key
to
heaven
and
hell
a
drop
of
blood
shed
in
the
cause
of
allah
a
night
spent
in
arms
is
of
more
avail
than
two
months
of
fasting
and
prayer
whoever
falls
in
battle
his
sins
are
forgiven
and
at
the
day
of
judgment
his
limbs
shall
be
supplied
with
the
wings
of
angels
and
before
the
battle
commenced
the
commanders
reminded
the
warriors
of
the
beautiful
celestial
houris
who
awaited
the
heroes
slain
in
battle
at
the
gates
of
paradise
the
first
efforts
having
been
crowned
with
success
the
moslems
soon
became
convinced
of
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
that
allah
had
given
them
the
world
and
wished
them
to
subdue
all
unbelievers
under
the
caliph
omar
the
arabs
had
become
a
community
of
warriors
whose
mission
it
was
to
conquer
and
plunder
all
civilised
and
cultured
lands
and
to
unfurl
the
banner
of
the
crescent
they
believed
that
is
under
the
shadow
of
the
in
this
belief
the
followers
of
muhammed
engaged
in
battle
without
fear
or
anxiety
spurred
to
great
deeds
reckless
in
the
face
of
danger
happy
to
die
and
pass
to
the
delights
of
paradise
the
became
an
armed
propaganda
pleasing
to
allah
it
was
however
a
form
of
propaganda
quite
unknown
and
amazing
to
christendom
in
the
course
of
two
centuries
the
crescent
had
supplanted
the
cross
of
what
avail
was
the
peaceful
preaching
if
province
after
province
and
country
after
country
were
taken
possession
of
by
the
new
religion
that
forced
its
way
by
means
of
fire
and
sword
was
it
not
natural
that
christian
europe
should
conceive
the
idea
of
doing
for
their
religion
what
the
moslems
did
for
islam
and
that
following
the
example
of
moslems
in
their
war
christians
should
emulate
them
in
the
crusades
it
must
not
be
forgotten
also
that
the
arabs
almost
from
the
first
appearance
of
muhammedanism
were
under
the
refining
and
elevating
influences
of
art
and
science
while
the
rest
of
europe
was
in
the
midnight
of
the
dark
ages
the
moorish
universities
of
spain
were
the
beacon
of
the
revival
of
learning
the
christian
teacher
was
still
manipulating
the
bones
of
the
saints
when
the
arab
physician
was
practising
surgery
the
monachal
schools
and
monasteries
in
italy
france
and
germany
were
still
grappling
with
poor
scholastic
knowledge
when
arab
scholars
were
well
advanced
in
the
study
of
aristotle
and
plato
stimulated
by
their
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
ptolemy
and
euclid
galenus
and
hippocrates
they
extended
their
researches
into
the
dominions
of
astronomy
mathematics
and
medicine

the
religious
orders
of
the
knights
a
product
of
the
crusades
found
their
antitype
in
similar
organisations
of
the
moslems
orders
that
had
exactly
the
same
tendencies
and
regulations
such
an
order
established
for
the
spread
of
islam
and
the
protection
of
its
followers
was
that
of
the
raabites
or
in
the
pyrenean
peninsula
these
knights
made
a
vow
to
carry
throughout
their
lives
arms
in
defence
of
the
faith
they
led
an
austere
existence
were
not
allowed
to
fly
in
battle
but
were
compelled
either
to
conquer
or
fall
like
the
templars
or
the
hospital
knights
their
whole
endeavour
was
to
gain
universal
dominion
for
their
religion
the
relation
existing
between
the
moslems
and
the
christians
before
the
crusades
was
much
closer
than
is
generally
imagined
moslem
soldiers
often
fought
in
the
ranks
of
the
christian
armies
and
it
was
by
no
means
rare
to
see
a
christian
ruler
call
upon
moslem
warriors
to
assist
him
against
his
adversary
pope
gregory
rescued
rome
from
the
hands
of
his
imperial
opponent
henry
of
germany
only
with
the
aid
of
the
saracen
soldiers
when
therefore
the
influence
of
muhammedanism
began
to
assert
itself
throughout
the
south
of
europe
it
was
natural
that
in
a
crude
and
stirring
age
when
strife
was
the
dominant
passion
of
the
people
the
idea
of
a
holy
war
in
the
cause
of
faith
was
one
in
which
christian
europe
was
ready
to
take
an
example
from
the
followers
of
islam
the
political
economical
and
social
state
of
affairs
the
misery
and
suffering
of
the
people
and
even
the
hierarchy
and
the
ascetic
spirit
of
the
time
certainly
made
the
minds
of
the
people
accessible
to
the
idea
of
war
the
spirit
of
unrest
was
pervasive
and
the
time
was
ripe
but
the
influence
of
islam
was
a
prominent
factor
in
giving
to
it
an
entirely
religious
aspect
but
even
in
the
means
employed
to
incite
the
christian
warriors
and
the
manner
in
which
the
crusades
were
carried
on
there
is
a
great
similarity
between
the
christian
and
the
muhammedan
procedure
the
church
when
espousing
the
cause
of
the
crusader
did
exactly
what
muhammed
had
done
when
he
preached
a
holy
war
the
church
addressed
itself
to
the
weaknesses
and
passions
of
human
nature
fallen
in
battle
the
moslem
so
he
was
told
would
be
admitted
be
he
victor
or
vanquished
to
the
joys
of
paradise
the
same
prospect
animated
the
crusader
and
made
him
brave
danger
and
die
joyfully
in
defence
of
christianity
them
kill
the
enemy
or
die
to
submit
to
die
for
christ
or
to
cause
one
of
his
enemies
to
die
is
naught
but
glory
said
saint
bernard
eloquently
vividly
and
in
glowing
colours
were
the
riches
that
awaited
the
warriors
in
the
far
east
described
immense
spoil
would
be
taken
from
the
unbelievers
preachers
did
not
even
shrink
from
extolling
the
beauty
of
the
women
in
the
lands
to
be
conquered
this
fact
recalls
promise
to
his
believers
that
they
would
meet
the
houris
in
the
life
after
death
to
the
material
sensual
allurements
the
church
added
spiritual
blessings
and
eternal
rewards
guaranteed
to
those
who
took
the
red
cross
during
the
crusades
the
christians
did
their
utmost
to
copy
the
cruelties
of
the
moslems
that
contempt
for
human
life
that
entire
absence
of
mercy
and
the
sense
of
pity
which
is
familiar
in
all
countries
where
islam
has
gained
sway
is
characteristic
also
of
the
crusades
although
the
narrative
of
the
crusades
belongs
rather
to
the
history
of
europe
than
of
any
one
country
it
is
so
closely
intertwined
with
the
history
of
egypt
at
this
period
that
some
digression
is
necessary
about
twenty
years
after
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
by
the
turks
in
the
holy
sepulchre
was
visited
by
a
hermit
of
the
name
of
peter
a
native
of
amiens
in
the
province
of
picardy
france
his
resentment
and
sympathy
were
excited
by
his
own
injuries
and
the
oppression
of
the
christian
name
he
mingled
his
tears
with
those
of
the
patriarch
and
earnestly
inquired
if
no
hope
of
relief
from
the
greek
emperors
of
the
east
could
be
entertained
the
patriarch
exposed
the
vices
and
weakness
of
the
successors
of
constantine
will
rouse
exclaimed
the
hermit
martial
nations
of
europe
in
your
cause
and
europe
was
obedient
to
the
call
of
the
hermit
the
astonished
patriarch
dismissed
him
with
epistles
of
credit
and
complaint
and
no
sooner
did
he
land
at
bari
than
peter
hastened
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
roman
pontiff
pope
urban
ii
received
him
as
a
prophet
applauded
his
glorious
design
promised
to
support
it
in
a
general
council
and
encouraged
him
to
proclaim
the
deliverance
of
the
holy
land
invigorated
by
the
approbation
of
the
pontiff
this
zealous
missionary
traversed
with
speed
and
success
the
provinces
of
italy
and
france
he
preached
to
innumerable
crowds
in
the
churches
the
streets
and
the
highways
the
hermit
entered
with
equal
confidence
the
palace
and
the
cottage
and
the
people
of
all
classes
were
impetuously
moved
by
his
call
to
repentance
and

city

besieged
by
the
crusaders
and
it
surrendered
to
them
after
forty
days
twice
did
new
expeditions
arrive
from
egypt
and
attempt
to
retake
the
city
but
with
disastrous
results
and
further
expeditions
were
impossible
for
some
time
owing
to
the
internal
disorders
in
egypt
mustali
died
after
a
reign
of
about
four
years
and
some
historians
record
as
a
truly
remarkable
circumstance
that
he
was
a
sunnite
by
creed
although
he
represented
a
shiite
dynasty
the
next
ruler
was
the
son
of
mustali
and
conducted
the
government
until
he
became
of
age
to
govern
his
first
act
was
to
put
to
death
under
the
internal
condition
of
egypt
continued
unsatisfactory
and
the
crusaders
who
had
been
very
successful
in
capturing
the
towns
of
syria
were
only
deterred
from
an
advance
on
egypt
by
the
death
of
their
leader
baldwin
in
some
of
the
surviving
partisans
of
it
is
said
put
to
death
and
a
son
of

of
affairs
and
appointed

grandson
of

as

whose
name
was
abu
ali
ahmed
perished
in
a
popular
tumult
the
new
caliph
had
great
trouble
with
his
next
three
viziers
and
at
length
abolished
the
office
altogether
after
reigning
twenty
years
he
was
succeeded
by
his
licentious
son
dhafir
whose
faults
led
to
his
death
at
the
hand
of
his
vizier
for
the
ensuing
six
years
the
supreme
power
in
egypt
was
mainly
the
bone
of
contention
between
rival
viziers
although
a
boy
of
five
was
nominally
elected
caliph
on
the
death
of
dhafir
was
worsted
by
his
rival
tataë
and
fled
to
syria
with
a
large
sum

had
been
opened

to
raise
the

of
an
enormous
sum
of
money
but
before
these
conditions
had
been
fulfilled
the
approach
of
the
syrian
army
induced
amaury
to
retreat
in
haste
shirkuh
and
saladin
entered
the
capital
in
great
state
and
were
received
with
honour
by
the
caliph
and
with
obsequiousness
by
shawir
who
was
contriving
a
plot
which
was
fortunately
discovered
and
for
which
he
paid
with
his
life
shirkuh
was
then
appointed
vizier
by
but
dying
very
shortly
he
was
succeeded
in
that
dignity
by
his
nephew
saladin
saladin
inaugurated
his
reign
with
a
series
of
brilliant
successes
egypt
once
again
took
an
important
place
among
the
nations
and
by
the
wars
of
saladin
it
became
the
nucleus
of
a
great
empire
military
glory
was
never
the
sole
aim
of
saladin
and
his
successors
they
continued
to
extend
to
letters
and
the
arts
their
willing
patronage
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
this
were
felt
upon
the
civilisation
of
the
country
though
ruler
of
egypt
saladin
gained
his
greatest
renown
by
his
campaigns
against
the
crusaders
in
syria
the
inability
of
nur
son
ismail
to
govern
the
syrian
dominions
became
an
excuse
for
occupation
of
syria
as
guardian
of
the
young
prince
and
once
having
assumed
this
function
he
remained
in
fact
the
master
of
syria
he
continued
to
consolidate
his
power
in
these
parts
until
the
crusaders
under
philip
count
of
flanders
laid
siege
to
antioch
saladin
now
went
out
to
meet
them
with
the
egyptian
army
and
fought
the
fierce
battle
of
ascalon
which
proved
to
be
disastrous
to
himself
his
army
being
totally
defeated
and
his
life
endangered
after
this
however
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
gain
certain
minor
advantages
and
continued
to
hold
his
own
until
a
famine
broke
out
in
palestine
which
compelled
him
to
come
to
terms
with
the
crusaders
and
two
years
later
a
truce
was
concluded
with
the
king
of
jerusalem
and
saladin
returned
to
egypt
in
the
year
he
again
entered
syria
and
made
war
on
the
seljukide
sultan
of
anatolia
and
on
leon
king
of
armenia
both
of
whom
he
forced
to
come
to
terms
soon
after
his
return
saladin
again
left
egypt
to
prosecute
a
war
with
the
crusaders
since
it
was
plain
that
neither
side
was
desirous
of
remaining
at
peace
through
an
incident
which
had
just
occurred
the
wrath
of
the
crusaders
had
been
kindled
a
vessel
bearing
fifteen
hundred
pilgrims
had
been
wrecked
near
damietta
and
its
passengers
captured
when
the
king
of
jerusalem
remonstrated
saladin
replied
by
complaining
of
the
constant
inroads
made
by
renaud
de
châtillon
this
restless
warrior
undertook
an
expedition
against
eyleh
and
for
this
purpose
constructed
boats
at
kerak
and
conveyed
them
on
camels
to
the
sea
but
this
flotilla
was
repulsed
and
the
siege
was
raised
by
a
fleet
sent
thither
by
the
brother
of
saladin
and
his
viceroy
a
second
expedition
against
eyleh
was
still
more
unfortunate
to
the
franks
who
were
defeated
and
taken
prisoners
on
this
occasion
the
captives
were
slain
in
the
valley
of
mina
saladin
then
threatened
kerak
encamped
at
tiberias
and
ravaged
the
territory
of
the
franks
he
next
made
a
futile
attempt
to
take
beirut
he
was
more
successful
in
a
campaign
against
mesopotamia
which
he
reduced
to
submission
with
the
exception
of
mosul
while
absent
here
the
crusaders
did
little
except
undertake
several
forays
and
saladin
at
length
returned
towards
palestine
winning
many
victories
and
conquering
aleppo
on
the
way
he
next
ravaged
samaria
and
at
last
received
the
fealty
of
the
lord
of
mosul
though
he
did
not
succeed
in
actually
conquering
the
city
in
the
year
war
broke
out
again
between
saladin
and
the
christian
hosts
the
sultan
had
respected
a
truce
which
he
had
made
with
baldwin
the
leper
king
of
jerusalem
but
the
restless
renaud
who
had
previously
attacked
eyleh
had
broken
through
its
stipulations
his
plunder
of
a
rich
caravan
enraged
saladin
who
forthwith
sent
out
orders
to
all
his
vassals
and
lieutenants
to
prepare
for
a
holy
war
in
the
year
he
marched
from
damascus
to
kerak
where
he
laid
close
siege
to
renaud
at
the
same
time
a
large
body
of
cavalry
was
sent
on
towards
nazareth
under
his
son
they
were
met
by
knights
hospitallers
and
templars
aided
by
a
few
hundred
inspired
by
the
heroic
jacques
de
maillé
marshal
of
the
temple
they
defied
the
large
saracen
army
in
the
conflict
which
ensued
the
crusaders
immortalised
themselves
by
fighting
until
only
three
of
their
number
were
left
alive
who
after
the
conflict
was
over
managed
to
escape
soon
after
this
saladin
himself
approached
with
a
great
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
and
the
christians
with
all
their
forces
hastened
to
meet
him
upon
the
shores
of
lake
tiberias
the
result
of
this
battle
proved
to
be
the
most
disastrous
defeat
which
the
christians
had
yet
suffered
they
were
weakened
by
thirst
and
on
the
second
day
of
the
conflict
a
part
of
their
troops
fled
but
the
knights
nevertheless
continued
to
make
a
heroic
defence
until
they
were
overwhelmed
by
numbers
and
forced
to
flee
to
the
hills
of
hittûn
a
great
number
of
crusaders
fell
in
this
conflict
and
guy
de
lusignan
king
of
jerusalem
and
his
brother
renaud
de
châtillon
were
among
the
prisoners
of
war
the
number
of
those
taken
was
very
great
and
saladin
left
an
indelible
stain
upon
a
reign
otherwise
renowned
for
mercy
and
humanity
by
allowing
the
prisoners
to
be
massacred

the
great
clemency
of
saladin
is
chronicled
on
this
occasion
by
christian
historians
but
the
same
was
an
offence
to
many
of
the
moslems
and
is
but
little
referred
to
by
their
historians
tyre
was
now
again
besieged
and
was
on
the
point
of
capture
when
the
besieged
were
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
conrad
son
of
the
marquis
of
monferrat
the
defence
was
now
fought
with
such
vigour
that
saladin
abandoned
it
and
made
an
attack
upon
tripoli
but
with
no
better
success
although
he
succeeded
in
forcing
bohemond
prince
of
antioch
and
ruler
of
tripoli
to
submit
on
terms
favourable
to
himself
after
this
saladin
took
part
in
the
defence
of
the
siege
of
acre
which
called
forth
deeds
of
gallantry
and
heroism
on
both
sides
and
which
lasted
for
two
years
during
which
it
roused
the
interest
of
the
whole
of
the
christian
world
the
invading
army
were
in
time
reinforced
by
the
redoubtable
richard
coeur
de
lion
king
of
england
and
philip
ii
of
france
and
breaking
down
all
opposition
they
captured
the
city
and
floated
upon
its
walls
the
banners
of
the
cross
in
the
year
unfortunately
for
the
good
name
of
the
christians
an
act
of
ferocious
barbarity
marred
the
lustre
of
their
triumph
for
moslems
were
cut
down
in
cold
blood
in
consequence
of
the
failure
of
saladin
to
fulfil
the
terms
of
the
capitulation
and
the
palliative
plea
that
the
massacre
was
perpetrated
in
the
heat
of
the
assault
can
scarcely
be
urged
in
extenuation
of
this
enormity
while
many
historians
have
laid
the
blame
on
king
richard
the
historian
michaud
believes
it
rather
to
have
been
decided
on
in
a
council
of
the
chiefs
of
the
crusade
after
a
period
of
rest
and
debauchery
the
army
of
the
crusaders
led
on
by
king
richard
began
to
march
towards
jerusalem
saladin
harassed
his
advance
and
rendered
the
strongholds
on
the
way
defenceless
and
ravaged
the
whole
country
richard
was
nevertheless
ever
victorious
his
great
personal
bravery
struck
terror
into
the
moslems
and
he
won
an
important
victory
over
them
at
arsûr
dissensions
now
broke
out
among
chiefs
of
the
crusaders
and
richard
himself
proved
to
be
a
very
uncertain
leader
in
regard
to
the
strategy
of
the
campaign
so
serious
were
these
drawbacks
that
the
ultimate
aim
of
the
enterprise
was
thereby
frustrated
and
the
crusaders
never
attained
to
their
great
object
which
was
the
of
jerusalem
at
the
time
when
the
christian
armies
were
in
possession
of
all
the
cities
along
the
coast
from
jaffa
to
tyre
and
the
hosts
of
saladin
were
seriously
disorganised
a
treaty
was
concluded
and
king
richard
sailed
back
on
the
return
journey
to
england
the
glory
acquired
by
saladin
and
the
famous
campaigns
of
richard
cour
de
lion
have
rendered
the
third
crusade
the
most
memorable
in
history
and
the
exploits
of
the
heroes
on
both
sides
shed
a
lustre
on
the
arms
of
both
moslems
and
christians
saladin
died
about
a
year
after
the
conclusion
of
this
peace
at
damascus
at
the
age
of
with
less
rashness
and
bravery
than
richard
saladin
possessed
a
firmer
character
and
one
far
better
calculated
to
carry
on
a
religious
war
he
paid
more
attention
to
the
results
of
his
enterprises
more
master
of
himself
he
was
more
fit
to
command
others
when
mounting
the
throne
of
the
atabegs
saladin
obeyed
rather
his
destiny
than
his
inclinations
but
when
once
firmly
seated
he
was
governed
by
only
two
passions
that
of
reigning
and
that
of
securing
the
triumph
of
the
koran
on
all
other
subjects
he
was
moderate
and
when
a
kingdom
or
the
glory
of
the
prophet
was
not
in
question
the
son
of
ayyub
was
admired
as
the
most
just
and
mild
of
muhammedans
the
stern
devotion
and
ardent
fanaticism
that
made
him
take
up
arms
against
the
christians
only
rendered
him
cruel
and
barbarous
in
one
single
instance
he
displayed
the
virtues
of
peace
amidst
the
horrors
of
war
the
bosom
of
the
camps
says
an
oriental
poet
covered
the
nations
with
the
wings
of
his
justice
and
poured
upon
his
cities
the
plenteous
showers
of
his
during
his
reign
many
remarkable
public
works
were
executed
the
muhammedans
always
governed
by
fear
were
astonished
that
a
sovereign
could
inspire
them
with
so
much
love
and
followed
him
with
joy
to
battle
his
generosity
his
clemency
and
particularly
his
respect
for
an
oath
were
often
the
subjects
of
admiration
to
the
christians
whom
he
rendered
so
miserable
by
his
victories
and
of
whose
power
in

he
had
completed

fearing
that
he
might
become
too
powerful
forced
him
to
conclude

the
only
advantage
he
obtained
was
that
he
regained

the
southern
part
of

beirut
he
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
still
later
he
permitted
several
attacks
of
the
christians
such
as
the
devastation
of
the
town
fuah
situated
on
the
rosetta
arm
of
the
nile
to
pass
unnoticed
and
even
bought
peace
at
the
expense
of
the
districts
of

had
formerly
belonged
to
him
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
he
acted
upon
the
offensive
against
the
regent
john
of

and
even
then
he
contented
himself
with
slight
advantages

concluded

thirty
years

pope
honorius
iii
had
successfully
aroused
the
zeal
of
the
western
nations
for
a
new
crusade
numerous
and
pilgrims
among
whom
were
king
andreas
of

and
duke
leopold
of

landed
at
acre
in
and
king
john
of
jerusalem
led
them
against
the
moslems
hastened
from
egypt
to
the
scene
of
action
but
was
forced
to
retreat
to
damascus
and
to
give
up
the
whole
of
the
southern
district
with
the
exception
of
the
holy
town
to
be
plundered
by
the
christians
in
the
following
spring
whilst
was
in
syria
a
christian
fleet
sailed
to
damietta
and
besieged
the
town
the
attacking
forces
were
composed
of
germans
and
hungarians
who
had
embarked
at
spalato
on
the
adriatic
for
jean
where
they
spent
a
year
in
unfortunate
expeditions
and
quarrels
with
the
christians
of
syria
they
were
joined
by
a
fleet
of
three
hundred
boats
furnished
by
north
germans
and
frisians
who
leaving
the
banks
of
the
rhine
had
journeyed
there
by
way
of
the
straits
of
gibraltar
prolonging
the
journey
by
a
fighting
in
portugal
the
christians
then
in
palestine
had
persuaded
the
crusaders
to
begin
with
an
attack
on
egypt
and
they
had
therefore
chosen
to
land
at
damietta
this
was
a
large
commercial
town
to
the
east
of
one
of
the
arms
of
the
nile
which
was
defended
by
three
walls
and
a
large
tower
built
on
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
nile
from
which
started
the
chains
that
barred
the
river
the
frisian
sailors
constructed
a
castle
of
wood
which
was
placed
between
the
masts
of
two
ships
and
from
which
the
crusaders
were
able
to
leap
to
the
tower
and
thus
they
were
able
to
blockade
and
starve
the
town
the
siege
was
long
and
an
epidemic
breaking
out
among
the
besiegers
carried
off
a
sixth
of
their
number
the
sultan
tried
to
succour
the
besieged
by
floating
down
the
stream
corpses
of
camels
which
were
stuffed
with
provisions
but
the
christians
captured
them
he
then
offered
to
give
the
crusaders
on
condition
they
would
depart
the
true
cross
and
all
he
possessed
of
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
but
pelagius
the
papal
legate
a
spanish
monk
who
had
himself
named
rejected
the
offer
was
so
stunned
by
the
news
of
the
success
of
the
christians
that
he
died
a
few
days
after
august
however
was
not
discouraged
he
not
only
defended
damietta
but
also
harassed
the
enemy
in
their
own
camp
by
means
of
hordes
of
bedouins
not
until
he
was
forced
by
a
conspiracy
of
his
troops
in
favour
of
his
brother
to
fly
to
cairo
did
the
christians
succeed
in
getting
across
the
nile
and
completely
surrounding
damietta
order
was
soon
restored
in
egypt
owing
to
the
arrival
of
prince
muzzain
who
had
taken
over
the
government
of
damascus
on
the
death
of
his
father
the
rebels
were
chastised
and
both
brothers
proceeded
towards
damietta
they
could
not
succeed
however
in
raising
the
siege
and
the
garrison
diminished
daily
through
hunger
sickness
and
constant
attacks
and
the
fortress
soon
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
crusaders
almost
without
a
blow
november
the
crusaders
pillaged
the
town
taking
from
it
four
hundred
thousand
gold
pieces
the
italians
also
settled
there
and
made
it
the
seat
of
their
commerce
with
egypt
this
conquest
caused
excitement
in
europe
and
the
pope
called
pelagius
second

public
fountain
cairo
if
the
franks
had
been
more
at
peace
among
themselves
they
might
easily
have
pushed
forward
to
cairo
after
the
fall
of
damietta
but
the
greatest
discontent
prevailed
between
the
papal
legate
pelagius
and
king
john
of
brienne
so
that
the
latter
soon
after
left
egypt
while
pelagius
was
forced
to
wait
for
reinforcements
before
he
could
get
away
from
damietta
meanwhile
reinforced
his
army
with
the
help
of
the
friendly
syrian
princes
and
by
destroying
the
channels
and
dams
of
the
nile
canals
so
endangered
the
christian
camp
that
they
were
soon
forced
to
sue
for
peace
and
offered
to
quit
damietta
on
the
condition
of
an
unmolested
retreat
equally
anxious
for
peace
accepted
these
conditions
august
scarcely
had
the
æyubites
thus
warded
off
the
threatening
danger
when
they
proceeded
to
fall
out
among
themselves
after
the
death
of
who
in
the
end
was
generally
regarded
as
overlord
a
new
war
broke
out
in
march
between
his
son
who
was
reigning
in
egypt
and
his
brother
ayyub
who
occupied
damascus
ayyub
conquered
egypt
but
in
his
absence
his
uncle
ismail
prince
of
balbek
seized
upon
damascus
and
made
a
league
with
the
franks
in
palestine
and
several
of
the
syrian
princes
through
this
unnatural
league
ismail
however
estranged
not
only
the
moslem
inhabitants
of
syria
but
also
his
own
army
part
of
the
army
deserted
in
consequence
to
ayyub
who
was
thus
enabled
easily
to
subdue
the
allied
army
another
coalition
was
formed
against
him
a
few
years
later
and
this
time
of
kerak
was
one
of
the
allies
ayyub
sent
a
strong
army
of
egyptians
negroes
and
mamluks
under
the
future
sultan
beybars
to
syria
the
syrian
troops
fought
unwillingly
against
their
in
the
opposite
ranks
and
the
wild
who
had
also
joined
the
ranks
inspired
them
with
terror
so
that
they
deserted
the
field
of
battle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
gaza
october
the
christians
left
to
themselves
were
not
in
a
position
to
resist
the
attacks
and
the
egyptians
made
themselves
masters
of
jerusalem
and
hebron
and
in
the
following
year
obtained
damascus
balbek
ascalon
and
tiberias
in
ayyub
came
again
into
syria
in
order
to
chastise
prince
of
aleppo
who
had
seized
upon
hemessa
when
he
heard
of
the
coming
crusaders
under
saint
louis
to
this
end
he
made
peace
with
the
natives
of
aleppo
and
returned
to
jerusalem
in
order
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
defence
the
pilgrims
however
succeeded
in
landing
for
emir
fakhr
the
egyptian
commander
had
taken
to
flight
after
a
short
skirmish
and
the
fortress
was
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
june
ayyub
now
established
a
firm
footing
in
the
town
of
cairo
which
his
father
had
founded
in
a
district
intersected
by
canals
and
harassed
the
christian
camp
with
his
light
cavalry
louis
was
expecting
reinforcements
but
they
did
not
arrive
until
the
inundations
of
the
nile
made
any
advance
into
the
interior
almost
impossible
at
last
on
the
of
december
the
christian
army
arrived
at
the
canal
of
ashmum
tanah
which
alone
separated
them
from
the
town
of
mansuria
the
egyptians
were
now
commanded
by
emir
fakhr
ayyub
had
died
a
month
before
but
his
wife
shejret
kept
his
death
a
secret
until
his
son
turan
shah
should
arrive
from
mesopotamia
fakhr
did
everything
in
his
power
to
retrieve
his
former
error
he
attacked
the
christians
when
they
were
engaged
in
building
a
dam
across
the
canal
hindering
their
work
on
the
southern
bank
with
his
destroying
their
towers
with
greek
fire
and
when
in
spite
of
all
discouragements
their
toilsome
work
was
nearly
finished
he
rendered
it
useless
by
digging
out
a
new
basin
into
which
he
conducted
the
water
of
the
ashmum
canal
on
the
of
february
the
french
crossed
the
canal
but
instead
of
collecting
there
as
the
king
had
commanded
so
as
to
attack
the
enemy
several
troops
pressed
forward
against
the
egyptians
and
many
including
the
count
of
artois
the
brother
were
killed
by
the
valiant
enemy
under
beybars
the
battle
remained
long
undecided
for
the
egyptians
had
barricaded
cairo
so
well
that
it
could
only
be
stormed
at
the
cost
of
many
lives
and
after
the
capture
the
army
needed
rest
the
egyptians
took
advantage
of
this
delay
to
bring
a
fleet
up
in
the
rear
of
the
egyptian
ships
which
in
combination
with
the
fleet
stationed
near
mansuria
attacked
and
completely
destroyed
them
as
soon
as
they
were
masters
of
the
nile
the
egyptians
landed
troops
below
the
christian
camp
which
was
thus
completely
cut
off
from
damietta
and
soon
suffered
the
greatest
hardships
from
lack
of
provisions
under
these
circumstances
louis
opened
negotiations
with
turan
shah
and
when
these
proved
fruitless
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
return
to
damietta
although
they
began
their
retreat
by
night
they
did
not
thus
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
egyptians
the
fugitives
were
overtaken
on
the
following
morning
and
so
shut
in
by
the
enemy
that
resistance
was
impossible
a
large
portion
of
the
army
was
cut
to
pieces
in
spite
of
their
surrender
the
rest
together
with
the
king
and
his
brother
were
taken
prisoners
and
brought
in
triumph
to
cairo
turan
shah
treated
the
king
with
consideration
and
hastened
to
conclude
peace
with
the
bahritic
mamluks
so
called
because
they
had
been
brought
up
on
the
nile
bahr
on
the
island
rhodha
as
soon
as
the
ransom
money
of
his
prisoners
was
assured
the
bahrites
grumbled
at
this
peace
because
it
left
the
christians
in
palestine
in
possession
of
their
towns
and
they
forthwith
murdered
turan
shah
with
the
help
of
shejret
whom
he
had
maltreated
may
after
turan
death
his
mother
was
proclaimed
sultana
and
the
mamluk
aibek
became
general
of
the
army
later
when
the
caliph
of
baghdad
revolted
against
the
rule
of
a
woman
aibek
assumed
the
title
of
sultan
and
married
shejret
he
ruled
again
after
some
time
in
the
name
of
a
young
descendant
of
kamil
so
as
to
be
able
to
fight
against
the
ayyubids
in
syria
who
with
at
their
head
had
taken
possession
of
damascus
with
an
appearance
of
right
a
battle
took
place
between
aibek
and
the
syrians
february
which
was
decided
in
favour
of
aibek
in
consequence
of
the
treachery
of
the
turks
under
nasir
aibek
again
assumed
the
title
of
sultan
after
the
victory
but
was
soon
after
to
be
murdered
by
the
mamluks
who
were
unwilling
to
be
subject
to
any
control
he
anticipated
their
plot
however
and
slew
their
leader
the
emir
aktai
putting
his
followers
to
flight
he
then
demanded
the
diploma
of
investiture
and
the
insignia
of
his
office
from
the
caliph
and
also
pressed
the
prince
of
mosul
to
grant
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
his
own
wife
unable
to
endure
such
perfidy
had
him
murdered
in
his
bath
april

when
beybars
first
ascended
the
throne
he
assumed
the
name
of
sultan
kahir
the
but
afterwards
when
he
was
informed
that
this
name
had
always
brought
misfortune
to
its
bearer
he
changed
it
to
that
of
sultan
zahir
the
glorious
now
that
he
was
absolute
master
of

egypt
beybars
tried
to
obliterate
the
remembrance
of
the
misdeeds
he
had
formerly
been
guilty
of
by
means
of
undertakings
for
the
general
good
and
for
the
furtherance
of
religion
he
had
the
mosques
repaired

great
and
small
built
and
established
a
regular
post
between
cairo
and
damascus
in
order
to
obtain
a
semblance
of
legitimacy
since
he
was
but
a
usurper
beybars
recognised
a
nominal
descendant
of
the
house
of
abbas
as
caliph
who
in
the
proper
course
of
things
ought
to
invest
him
with
the
dominions
of
syria
and
egypt
beybars
bade
his
governors
receive
this
descendant
of
the
house
of
the
prophet
with
all
suitable
marks
of
honour
and
invited
him
to
come
to
egypt
when
he
approached
the
capital
the
sultan
himself
went
out

meet
him
followed

vizier
the
chief
cadi

the
chief
emirs

notabilities
of

town
even
the
jews
and
christians
had
to
take
part
in
the
procession
carrying
respectively
the
tora
and
the
gospel
the
caliph
made
his
entrance
into
cairo
with
the
greatest
pomp
rode
through
the
town
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
and
proceeded
to
the
citadel
where
beybars
had
appointed
him
a
magnificent
dwelling
some
days
afterwards
the
caliph
had
a
reception
of
the
chief
cadi
the
most
celebrated
theologians
and
lawyers
of
egypt
and
many
notables
of
the
capital
the
arabs
who
formed
his
escort
and
an
eunuch
from
baghdad
testified
to
the
identity
of
the
person
the
chief
cadi
recognised
their
assertion
as
valid
and
was
the
first
to
do
homage
to
him
as
caliph
thereupon
the
sultan
arose
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
him
and
swore
to
uphold
both
the
written
laws
of
the
koran
and
those
of
tradition
to
advance
the
good
and
hinder
the
evil
to
fight
zealously
for
the
protection
of
the
faith
only
to
impose
lawful
taxes
and
to
apply
the
taxes
only
to
lawful
purposes
after
the
sultan
had
finished
homage
was
done
by
the
sheiks
the
emirs
and
the
other
chief
officers
of
the
kingdom
the
caliph
invested
the
sultan
with
power
over
all
the
kingdoms
subject
to
islam
as
well
as
over
all
future
conquests
whereupon
the
people
of
all
classes
were
admitted
to
do
homage
likewise
then
command
was
sent

to
do

important

one
or
other
of

either
imprisoned

executed

merciless
but
he
proceeded
even
more
shamelessly
against
malik
mughith
prince
of
kerak
and
shaubek
whom
he
feared
so
much
as
one
of
the
bravest
descendants
of
the
house
of
ayyub
that
he
stamped
himself
publicly
as
a
perjured
assassin
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
beybars
had
at
first
without
any
declaration
of
war
in
fact
without
any
notification
of
it
in
egypt
suddenly
sent
a
detachment
of
troops
under
the
leadership
of
emir
bedr
aidimri
which
took
the
fortress
shaubek
by
surprise
and
placed
the
emir
saif
bilban
in
it
as
governor
in
the
next
year
in
order
to
win
over
mughith
he
liberated
his
son
aziz
whom
kotuz
had
captured
at
damascus
and
imprisoned
at
cairo
he
also
assured
mughith
of
his
friendly
intentions
towards
him
and
repeatedly
urged
him
to
arrange
a
meeting
did
not
trust
beybars
and
invented
all
kinds
of
reasons
not
to
accept
his
invitations
beybars
resolved
at
last
to
calm
the
fears
of
his
intended
victim
by
means
of
a
written
oath
the
fears
of
mughith
however
were
not
allayed
and
he
hesitated
to
fall
in
with
the
wish
of
the
sultan
and
to
appear
at
his
court
the
following
year
when
the
sultan
came
to
syria
and
again
urged
a
meeting
he
was
at
a
loss
for
an
excuse
and
was
forced
either
to
acknowledge
his
mistrust
or
risk
everything
he
sent
his
mother
first
to
gaza
where
she
was
received
with
the
greatest
friendliness
by
the
sultan
and
sent
back
laden
with
costly
presents
on
her
return
to
kerak
corrupted
by
the
hospitality
and
generosity
of
the
sultan
she
persuaded
her
son
to
wait
on
him
as
did
also
his
ambassador
alamjad
with
equal
zeal
finally
he
set
out
from
kerak
when
he
had
made
his
troops
do
homage
to
his
son
on
a
visit
to
the
sultan
who
wras
then
in
tur
the
sultan
rode
out
to
meet
him
as
far
as
beisan
malik
mughith
wished
to
dismount
when
he
perceived
the
sultan
but
he
would
not
permit
this
and
rode
beside
mughith
till
he
reached
his
own
tent
here
he
was
separated
from
his
followers
thrown
into
chains
and
brought
into
the
citadel
of
cairo
in
order
to
palliate
this
crime
the
sultan
made
public
the
correspondence
of
the
prince
of
kerak
with
the
mongols
which
it
was
thought
would
stamp
the
former
as
a
traitor
to
islam
the
judges
whom
he
brought
with
him
and
amongst
whom
we
find
the
celebrated
historian
ibn
khallikan
who
was
then
chief
judge
of
damascus
declared
him
guilty
but
we
only
have
historical
proof
of
the
sending
of
his
son
into
camp
to
beg
that
his
province
might
be
spared
at
a
time
when
all
the
princes
of
syria
seized
with
panic
threw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
mongolian
general
be
that
as
it
may
he
none
the
less
committed
a
piece
of
treachery
since
he
had
sworn
not
to
call
him
to
account
for
his
former
crimes
beybars
hoped
now
that
he
had
disposed
of
malik
mughith
that
the
fortress
kerak
would
immediately
surrender
to
his
emissary
emir
bedr
beisari
but
the
governor
of
the
fortress
feared
to
trust
the
promises
of
a
perjurer
and
offered
resistance
beybars
therefore
set
out
for
syria
with
all
the
necessary
siege
apparatus
constructed
by
the
best
engineers
of
egypt
and
syria
the
garrison
saw
the
impossibility
of
a
long
resistance
and
capitulated
the
son
of
malik
mughith
a
boy
of
twelve
was
honoured
as
prince
and
taken
to
egypt
as
also
family
his
emirs
and
officials
were
treated
with
consideration
but
the
prince
was
later
thrown
into
prison
nothing
certain
is
known
with
regard
to
the
death
of
mughith
according
to
some
reports
because
he
offended
the
wife
of
beybars
when
as
a
wandering
mamluk
he
once
was
staying
with
him
he
was
delivered
over
to
the
wives
and
was
put
to
death
by
them
another
account
says
that
he
died
of
hunger
in
prison
after
the
conquest
of
shekif
the
sultan
made
an
attack
on
the
province
of
tripoli
because
prince
governor
of
antioch
and
tripoli
was
his
bitterest
enemy
and
the
truest
ally
of
the
mongolians
and
had
moreover
at
the
time
of
attack
on
syria
made
himself
master
of
several
places
which
till
then
had
belonged
to
the
mussulmans
the
whole
land
was
wasted
all
the
houses
destroyed
all
christians
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
troops
were
murdered
and
several
strongholds
in
the
mountains
conquered
laden
with
rich
booty
the
moslem
army
set
out
for
hemessa
from
here
beybars
proceeded
towards
hamah
and
divided
the
army
into
three
divisions
one
division
under
the
emir
bedr
khaznadar
treasurer
was
to
take
the
direction
of
suwaidiya
the
port
of
antioch
the
second
under
emir
izz
ighan
struck
the
route
towards
the
third
which
he
led
himself
proceeded
in
a
straight
line
over
apamaa
and
schoghr
towards
antioch
which
was
the
for
the
two
other
emirs
and
would
so
be
shut
in
from
the
north
the
west
and
the
south
on
the
may
the
sultan
found
himself
in
front
of
the
town
which
contained
a
population
of
over
one
hundred
thousand
fighting
soon
ensued
between
the
outposts
of
the
sultan
and
the
constable
who
advanced
against
him
at
the
head
of
the
militia
the
latter
was
defeated
and
the
constable
himself
taken
prisoner
on
the
of
ramadhan
the
whole
army
had
united
and
preparations
were
made
for
the
siege
meanwhile
the
sultan
had
already
attempted
to
persuade
the
imprisoned
constable
to
return
to
the
town
and
enduce
them
to
surrender
and
to
leave
his
own
son
behind
as
a
hostage
but
when
several
days
had
passed
in
fruitless
discussions
at
last
the
sultan
gave
the
word
for
the
attack
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
christians
the
walls
were
scaled
on
the
same
day
and
the
garrison
retired
thereupon
into
the
citadel
the
inhabitants
were
massacred
or
taken
prisoner
and
all
the
houses
plundered
no
one
could
escape
for
beybars
had
blocked
all
the
entrances
on
the
next
day
the
garrison
women
and
children
included
which
numbered
eight
thousand
surrendered
on
account
of
lack
of
water
and
meal
the
chiefs
apparently
made
their
escape
during
the
confusion
and
fled
into
the
mountains
the
garrison
only
saved
their
lives
by
surrendering
beybars
had
them
chained
and
distributed
as
slaves
amongst
his
troops
he
then
had
the
other
prisoners
and
the
rest
of
the
booty
brought
together
and
proceeded
with
the
lawful
distribution
when
everything
had
been
settled
the
citadel
was
set
on
fire
but
the
conflagration
was
so
great
that
the
whole
town
was
consumed
beybars
died
soon
after
his
return
from
asia
minor
july
according
to
some
reports
his
death
was
occasioned
by
a
violent
fever
other
accounts
say
that
he
died
in
consequence
of
a
poison
which
he
had
prepared
for
an
ayyubid
and
which
he
accidentally
took
himself
he
had
designated
the
eldest
of
his
sons
as
his
successor
under
the
name
of
and
in
order
to
give
him
a
strong
support
he
had
married
him
to
the
daughter
of
the
emir
kilawun
one
of
his
best
and
most
influential
generals
in
spite
of
all
this
however
was
not
able
to
maintain
himself
on
the
throne
for
any
length
of
time
kilawun
conspired
against
his
master
and
was
soon
able
to
ascend
the
throne
under
the
title
of
his
fame
as
a
warrior
was
already
established
and
he
added
to
his
successes
during
his
ten
reign
his
first
task
was
to
quell
disturbances
in
syria
and
he
despatched
an
army
thither
and
captured
damascus
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
he
took
the
field
in
person
against
a
large
force
of
tatars
defeated
them
and
raised
the
siege
of
rahabah
eight
years
later
he
laid
siege
to
tripoli
then
rich
and
flourishing
after
two
centuries
of
christian
occupation
and
the
town
was
taken
and
its
inhabitants
killed
other
expeditions
were
undertaken
against
nubia
but
the
nubians
after
they
had
been
twice
defeated
appear
to
have
themselves
illustration
court
in
the
moristan
of
the
kilawun
the
fortress
of
acre
was
at
this
time
the
only
important
stronghold
still
retained
by
the
christians
and
for
its
conquest
kilawun
was
making
preparations
when
he
died
on
the
of
november
kilawun
says
the
modern
historian
weil
has
been
unduly
praised
by
historians
most
of
whom
lived
in
the
reign
of
his
son
he
was
certainly
not
so
bloodthirsty
as
beybars
and
he
also
oppressed
his
subjects
less
he
too
cared
more
for
the
increase
and
establishment
of
his
kingdom
than
for
justice
and
good
faith
he
held
no
agreement
sacred
if
he
could
get
any
advantage
by
breaking
it
as
was
shown
by
his
behaviour
towards
the
crusaders
and
the
descendants
of
beybars
the
most
beautiful
monument
which
he
left
behind
him
was
a
huge
building
outside
cairo
which
included
a
hospital
a
school
and
his
own
tomb
the
hospital
was
so
large
that
every
disease
had
a
special
room
allotted
to
it
there
were
also
apartments
for
women
and
large
storerooms
for
provisions
and
medical
requirements
and
a
large
auditorium
in
which
the
head
doctor
delivered
his
lectures
on
medicine
the
expenses
were
so
great
for
even
people
of
wealth
were
taken
without
compensation
that
special
administrators
were
appointed
to
oversee
and
keep
an
account
of
the
necessary
outlay
besides
these
officers
several
stewards
and
overseers
were
appointed
to
control
the
revenues
devoted
to
the
hospital
by
different
institutions
under
the
dome
of
the
tomb
the
koran
and
traditional
charters
were
taught
and
both
teachers
and
scholars
received
their
payment
from
the
state
a
large
adjacent
hall
contained
a
library
of
many
works
on
the
koran
tradition
language
medicine
practical
theology
jurisprudence
and
literature
and
was
kept
in
good
condition
by
a
special
librarian
and
six
officials
the
school
building
contained
four
for
the
teachers
of
the
islamite
schools
and
in
addition
to
these
a
school
for
children
into
which
sixty
poor
orphans
were
received
without
any
charge
and
provided
with
board
lodging
and
clothes
khalil
the
son
of
kilawun
who
succeeded
him
with
the
title
of

able
to
begin
operations
in
the
spring
of
against
acre
and
on
the
of
may
after
an
obstinate
resistance
the
town
was
taken
by
storm
those
who
could
not
escape
by
water
were
either
cut
down
or
taken
prisoner
the
town
was
plundered
then
burnt
and
the
fortifications
razed

such

which
were
still
in
the
hands
of
the
christians
offered
no
resistance
and
were
either
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
or

the
enemy
now
that
he
had
cleared

of
the
crusaders
turned
his
arms
against
the
mongols
and
their
vassals
he
began
with
the
storming
of
kalat
a
fortress
on
the
upper
euphrates
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bireh
the
possession
of
which
was
important
both
for
the
defence
of
northern
syria
and
for
attacks
on
armenia
and
asia
minor
in
spite
of
many
pompous
declarations
that
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
greater
conquests
in
asia
minor
and

he
retired
as
soon
as
the
ilkhan
kaikhatu
sent
a
strong
detachment
of
troops
against
him
later
on
he
threatened
the
prince
of
with
war
and
obliged
him
to
hand
over
certain
border
towns
he
also
exchanged
some
threatening
letters
with
kaikhatu
but
neither
reigned
long
enough
to
make
these
threats
good
for
kaikhatu
was
soon
after
dethroned
by
baidu
and
baidu
in
his
turn
by
gazan
after
many
civil
wars
which
had
continually
hindered
him
from
carrying

whilst
hunting
by

regent

whom
he
had
threatend
to
turn
out
of
his
office
kara
sonkor
lajin
and
some
of
the
other
emirs
had
conspired
with
baidara
in
the
hope
that
when
once
the
deed
was
accomplished
all
the
chiefs
in
the
kingdom
would
applaud
their
action
since
had
slain
and
imprisoned
many
influential
emirs
and
was
generally
denounced
as
an
irreligious
man
who
transgressed
not
only
against
the
laws
of
islam
but
also
against
those
of
nature
baidara
however
immediately
proceeded
to
mount
the
throne
and
a
strong
party
with
the
emir
ketboga
at
its
head
was
formed
against
him
ketboga
called
upon
mamluks
to
take
vengeance
pursued
the
rebels
and
killed
baidara
he
then
returned
to
cairo
and
after
long
negotiations
with
the
governor
of
the
capital
muhammed
a
younger
brother
of
was
proclaimed
sultan
with
the
title
of
muhammed
occupies
such
an
important
place
in
the
history
of
these
times
that
the
other
moslem
princes
may
easily
be
grouped
around
him
he
was
only
nine
years
old
when
he
was
summoned
to
be
ruler
of
the
kingdom
of
the
mamluks
naturally
he
was
the
sultan
only
in
name
and
the
real
power
lay
in
the
hands
of
ketboga
and
vizier
shujai
these
two
lived
in
perfect
harmony
so
long
as
they
were
merely
occupied
with
the
pursuit
of
their
rivals
not
only
the
friends
and
followers
of
murderer
but
also
the
innocent
of
because
he
had
treated
them
with
contempt
and
was
in
possession
of
riches
for
which
they
were
greedy
he
shared
the
fate
of
the
assassins
for
in
spite
of
the
intercession
of
the
ladies
of
the
royal
harem
he
ended
his
life
on
the
gallows
but
as
soon
as
the
two
rulers
had
got
rid
of
their
enemies
and
appeased
their
own
avarice
their
peaceful
union
was
at
an
end
for
each
wished
to
have
complete
control
over
the
sultan
shujai
had
the
mamluks
of
the
late
sultan
on
his
side
while
ketboga
who
was
a
mongol
by
birth
had
with
him
all
the
mongols
and
kurds
who
had
settled
in
the
kingdom
during
reign
a
mongol
warned
ketboga
against
shujai
who
had
made
all
necessary
preparations
to
throw
his
rival
into
prison
and
he
immediately
was
attacked
by
ketboga
and
defeated
after
several
attempts
ambition
was
not
yet
fulfilled
although
he
was
now
supreme
ruler
he
first
demanded
homage
as
regent
as
he
met
with
no
opposition
he
conceived
the
idea
of
setting
the
sultan
nasir
aside
and
he
hoped
to
carry
out
his
plan
with
the
assistance
of
lajin
and
kara
sonkor
murderers
and
their
numerous
following
he
had
the
pardon
of
these
two
emirs
proclaimed
whereupon
they
left
their
and
joined
ketboga
for
it
was
to
their
interest
also
that
the
sultan
should
be
put
out
of
the
way
this
was
a
complete
success
december
but
in
spite
of
these
plans
reign
was
both
unfortunate
and
brief
the
old
emirs
were
vexed
with
him
because
he
raised
his
own
mamluks
to
the
highest
posts
of
honour
and
the
clergy
were
displeased
because
he
received
favourably
a
number
of
mongols
although
they
were
heathens
the
people
blamed
him
for
the
severe
famine
which
visited
egypt
and
syria
and
which
was
followed
by
a
terrible
pestilence
several
emirs
with
lajin
again
at
their
head
conspired
against
him
and
forced
their
way
into
his
tent
while
he
was
on
the
way
to
syria
overpowering
the
guard
they
attempted
to
get
possession
of
his
person
he
managed
to
escape
however
and
so
saved
his
life
and
liberty
but
lajin
obtained
possession
of
the
throne
with
the
agreement
of
the
other
emirs
in
spite
of
his
advantages
both
as
man
and
as
pious
moslem
and
in
spite
of
his
brilliant
victories
over
the
princes
of
armenia
lajin
was
murdered
together
with
his
successor
and
nasir
who
was
then
living
in
kerak
was
recalled
as
sultan
january
nasir
was
still
too
young
to
reign
alone
he
had
to
let
himself
be
ruled
by
the
emirs
who
had
already
assumed
a
kind
of
regency
before
his
return
at
the
head
of
these
emirs
stood
sellar
and
beybars
jashingir
distrust
and
uneasiness
existed
between
these
two
one
of
whom
was
regent
and
the
other
prefect
of
the
palace
for
each
wanted
to
assume
the
chief
power
but
soon
their
private
intrigues
were
put
into
the
background
by
a
common
danger
the
ilkhan
gazan
was
actively
preparing
for
war
against
the
mamluk
kingdom
because
the
governor
of
aleppo
had
fallen
upon
mardin
a
town
belonging
to
the
mongols
and
brutally
maltreated
the
inhabitants
also
because
the
refugees
from
egypt
and
syria
assured
him
that
the
moment
was
favourable
for
extending
his
dominion
over
these
lands
the
internal
history
of
egypt
at
this
period
offers
nothing
but
tedious
strifes
between
different
emirs
and
specially
between
the
two
most
powerful
beybars
and
sellar
who
would
have
often
brought
it
to
open
warfare
had
not
their
friends
and
followers
intervened
they
agreed
however
on
one
point
namely
to
keep
the
sultan
as
long
as
possible
from
taking
over
the
reins
of
government
and
to
keep
him
as
secluded
as
possible
in
order
to
deprive
him
of
all
influence
whilst
sellar
was
wasting
immense
sums
the
sultan
was
in
fact
almost
starving
when
sellar
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
he
paid
the
debts
of
all
the
moslems
who
had
retired
to
this
town
he
further
distributed
ten
thousand
malters
of
fruit
amongst
the
poor
people
in
the
town
and
so
much
money
and
provisions
that
they
were
able
to
live
on
it
for
a
whole
year
he
also
treated
the
inhabitants
of
medina
and
jiddah
in
an
equally
generous
way
the
sultan
who
was
hunting
in
lower
egypt
at
the
same
time

was

so
long
that
he
succumbed
under
his
torments
in
the
year
when
nasir
was
years
old
though
still
treated
as
a
child

attempted
with
the
help
of
the
emir
bektimur
who
commanded
the
mamluks
in
the
palace
to
seize
the
persons
of
his
oppressors
the
plan
failed
for
they
had
their
spies
everywhere
and
the
only
result
was
that
the
faithful
servants
were
banished
to
syria
and
the
sultan
himself
was
more
oppressed
than
ever
it
was
two
years
before
he
succeeded
in
deceiving
his
tyrants
he
expressed
the
wish
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
this
was
granted
as
the
emirs
saw
nothing
dangerous
in
it
and
moreover
as
a
religious
duty
it
could
not
be
resisted
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
fortress
kerak
with
the
help
of
those
soldiers
in
his
escort
who
were
devoted
to
his
cause
and
having
deceived
the
governor
by
means
of
false
letters
he
obtained
possession
of
the
fortress
and
immediately
declared
his
independence
of
the
guardianship
of
sellar
and
beybars
sellar
and
beybars
on
hearing
this
immediately
summoned
the
sultan
to
return
to
cairo
but
even
before
they
received
his
answer
they
realised
that
their
rule
was
over
and
that
either
they
must
quit
the
field
or
nasir
must
be
dethroned
after
long
consideration
amongst
themselves
they
proceeded
to
the
choice
of
another
sultan
and
the
choice
fell
on
beybars
april
beybars
accepted
the
proffered
throne
on
the
condition
that
sellar
also
retained
his
place
he
confirmed
the
other
emirs
also
in
their
offices
hoping
thereby
to
gain
their
support

the

of
government
met
with
no
resistance
in
egypt
where
the
majority
of
the
emirs
had
long
been
dependent
on
beybars
and
sellar
in
syria
on
the
other
hand
the
emirs
acting
as
governors
refused
to
acknowledge
beybars
partly
from
devotion
to
race
and
partly
because
the
choice
had
been
made
without
their
consent
only
akush
governor
of
damascus
who
was
an
old
friend
of
beybars

him
a

took
the
oath

allegiance
the

with
the
governors

and

called
upon
nasir
to
join
them
and
with
the
help
of
his
other
followers
to
reconquer
egypt
the
cunning
sultan
who
saw
that
the
time
for
open
resistance
had
not
yet
arrived
since
egypt
was
as
yet
too
unanimous
and
damascus
also
had
joined
the
enemy
advised
them
to
deceive
beybars
and
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
which
they
could
break
later
as
having
been
obtained
by
force
he
himself
feigned
to
submit
to
the
new
government
and
even
had
the
prayers
carried
on
from
the
chancel
in
name
beybars
was
deceived
although
he
knew
with
certainty
that
nasir
carried
on
a
lively
intercourse
with
the
discontented
emirs
he
relied
chiefly
on
akush
who
kept
a
strict
watch
over
movements
the
spies
of
akush
however
were
open
to
corruption
and
they
failed
later
to
take
steps
to
render
nasir
harmless
at
the
right
moment
beybars
believed
nasir
to
be
still
in
kerak
when
he
was
well
on
the
way
to
damascus
and
when
he
finally
received
news
of
this
the
rebellion
had
already
gone
so
far
that
some
of
the
troops
who
had
been
sent
out
against
the
sultan
had
already
deserted
to
his
side
the
only
possible
way
of
allaying
the
storm
was
for
beybars
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
joining
forces
with
akush
to
offer
battle
to
nasir
the
necessary
courage
and
resolution
failed
him
instead
of
having
recourse
to
the
sword
he
applied
to
the
caliph
who
declared
nasir
an
exile
and
summoned
all
believers
to
listen
to
the
sultan
beybars
whom
he
had
consecrated
and
to
take
part
in
the
war
against
the
rebel
nasir
but
the
summons
of
the
caliph
which
was
read
in
all
the
chancels
had
not
the
slightest
effect
the
belief
in
the
caliph
had
long
disappeared
except
in
so
far
as
he
was
considered
a
tool
of
the
sultan
on
whom
he
depended
even
party
mocked
the
declaration
and
wherever
it
was
read
manifestations
were
made
in
favour
of
the
exile
beybars
also
was
now
deserted
by
sellar
and
he
at
length
was
obliged
to
resign
beybars
was
then
seized
and
throttled
by
nasir
and
sellar
was
starved
to
death
nasir
who
now
came
to
the
throne
had
grown
suspicious
and
treacherous
on
account
of
the
many
hardships
and
betrayals
endured
by
him
during
his
youth
he
was
however
favourable
to
the
christians
and
to
such
an
extent
that
he
received
anonymous
letters
reproaching
him
for
allowing
moslems
to
be
oppressed
by
christian
officials
he
found
them
to
be
experienced
in
financial
matters
for
in
spite
of
all
decrees
they
had
never
ceased
to
hold
secretaryships
in
different
states
they
were
moreover
more
unscrupulous
than
born
muhammedans
who
always
had
more
respect
for
law
custom
and
public
opinion
certainly
the
sultan
considered
the
ministers
in
whom
he
placed
great
confidence
less
dangerous
if
they
were
since
he
was
their
only
support
whereas
comrades
in
religion
could
always
find
plenty
of
support
and
might
easily
betray
him
nasir
died
on
the
of
june
at
about
years
of
age
after
a
reign
of
years
his
rule
which
did
not
actually
begin
until
he
mounted
the
throne
for
the
third
time
lasted
years
during
this
period
he
was
absolute
ruler
in
the
strongest
sense
of
the
word
every
important
affair
was
decided
by
him
alone
the
emirs
had
to
refer
all
matters
to
him
and
were
a
constant
source
of
suspicion
and
oversight
they
might
not
speak
to
each
other
in
his
presence
nor
visit
each
other
without
his
consent
the
mildest
punishment
for
breaking
such
decrees
was
banishment
to
syria
nasir
inspired
them
with
fear
rather
than
with
love
and
respect
and
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
his
illness
was
incurable
no
one
paid
any
further
attention
to
him
he
died
as
a
pious
moslem
and
repentant
sinner
in
the
presence
of
some
of
his
servants
his
burial
which
took
place
by
night
was
attended
by
a
few
emirs
and
only
one
wax
candle
and
one
lamp
were
carried
before
the
bier
as
one
of
his
biographers

remarks
the
rich
sultan
whose
dominion
had
extended
from
the
borders
of
abyssinia
to
asia
minor
and
up
the
euphrates
as
far
as

and
the
father
of

nasir
was
the
last
sultan
who
ruled
over
the
bahritic
mamluk
kingdom
with
a
firm
hand
after
his
death
we
read
of
one
insurrection
after
another
and
the
sultans
were
either
deposed
or
became
mere
slaves
of
the
emirs
abu
bekr
whom
nasir
had
appointed
his
successor
did
not
hold
his
own
for
quite
two
months
because
he
maltreated
the
discontented
emirs
and
put
his
favourites
in
their
places
an
insurrection
with
the
emir
kausun
at
its
head
was
formed
against
him
he
was
dethroned
and
his
brother
kujuk
was
proclaimed
sultan
in
his
stead
the
dethroned
sultan
was
banished
to
upper
egypt
whither
his
elder
brother
ahmed
should
have
been
brought
ahmed
however
refused
to
leave
his
fortress
of
kerak
and
finding
support
among
the
syrian
emirs
he
conspired
against
kausun
who
was
at
this
moment
threatened
also
with
an
insurrection
in
cairo
after
several
bloody
battles
kausun
was
forced
to
yield
and
ahmed
was
proclaimed
sultan
january
ahmed
however
preferred
a
quiet
peaceful
life
to
the
dangerous
post
of
sultan
and
not
until
he
had
received
the
most
solemn
oaths
of
allegiance
did
he
proceed
to
his
capital
where
he
arrived
quite
unexpectedly
so
that
no
festivities
had
been
prepared
after
some
time
he
had
all
the
syrian
emirs
arrested
by
his
because
they
tried
to
usurp
his
powers
he
then
appointed
a
regent
and
himself
returned
to
kerak
taking
with
him
everything
he
had
found
in
the
palace
and
there
he
remained
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
the
faithful
emirs
and
lived
simply
for
his
own
pleasure
the
natural
consequence
of
all
this
was
deposition
in
june
his
brother
ismail
a
youth
of
seventeen
years
sent
troops
to
kerak
to
demand
an
oath
of
allegiance
from
ahmed
but
they
could
effect
nothing
as
the
fortress
was
well
fortified
and
provisioned
and
moreover
many
of
the
emirs
both
in
syria
and
egypt
were
still
in
league
with
ahmed
not
until
fresh
troops
had
been
sent
and
ahmed
himself
betrayed
did
they
succeed
in
taking
the
fortress
and
ahmed
was
put
to
death
in
death
made
such
a
deep
impression
upon
the
weak
sultan
that
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
depression
which
gradually
increased
until
he
died

in
spite
of
all
he
had
many
admirers
who
overlooked
his
misdeeds

cruelty

he
was
a

shed
streams

his
avarice

too
appointed

also
soon
grasped

many
insurrections

turned

resolved

he
despatched
several
ships

object
in

they
landed
at

having
burnt
the
ships
in
the
harbour
and
plundered
the
town
they
returned
home
the
favourable

much
encouraged
the
sultan

year
he
sent
out
a
large
fleet
from
alexandria

landed
in
famagosta
this
town
soon
surrendered
and
the
troops
proceeded
to
plunder
the
neighbouring
places

defeated
all
the
troops
which
prince
henry
of
lusignan
sent
out
against
them

they
had
advanced

took
this
fortress

a
few
fighting
the
moslem

was
however
forced
to
retreat
but
the
cypriots
scattered
instead
of
pursuing
the
enemy
and
the
mamluks
seeing
this
renewed
their
attack
slew
many
christians

took
the
king
prisoner
the

then
capitulated
whereupon
the
egyptian

returned
to

the
captive

were
received
with
great
jubilation
the
king
of
cyprus
after
submitting
to
the
greatest
humiliations
was
asked
what
ransom
he
could
pay
he
replied
that
he
possessed
nothing
but
his
life
and
stuck
to
this
answer
although
threatened
with
death
meanwhile
venetian
and
other
european
merchants
negotiated
for
the
ransom
money

the
sultan
finally
contented
himself
with
two
hundred
thousand
dinars

was
not
set
at
liberty

as

cyprus
meanwhile
messengers
arrived
from
the
queen
offering
a
higher
tribute
and
inal
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
his
emirs
to
acknowledge
charlotte
as
queen
and
to
hand
james
over
to
her
ambassadors
but
as
soon
as
the
ambassadors
had
left
the
a
tumult
arose
the
people
declared
that
the
sultan
had
only
the
advantage
of
the
franks
especially
of
prince
louis
of
savoy
in
view
and
they
soon
took
such
a
threatening
attitude
that
inal
was
forced
to
declare
himself
for
james
again
and
renew
his
former
preparations
in
august
an
egyptian
fleet
bore
james
to
cyprus

obtained

declared
themselves
on

side

as
soon

had
taken

no

he
dismissed

in

was

exhorted

this
he
could
not

the
five
hundred
french

came

island
on

days
after

this
sight
filled

city

with
consternation
the
following
day
june
the
french
troops
landed
on
the
island
and
completely
invested
valetta
which
contained
a
population
of
nearly
thirty
thousand
souls
and
was
even
then
one
of
the
strongest
fortresses
in

the
inhabitants
were
dismayed

clamoured
for
surrender
and
the
grand
master
who
possessed
little
energy
and
recollected
the
generosity
of
the
conqueror
of
rivoli
at
mantua
hoping
to
save
his
interest
from
shipwreck
released
one
of
the
french
knights
whom
he
had
thrown
into
prison
when
they
refused
to
fight
against
their
countrymen
and
sent
him
to
bonaparte
to
negotiate
a
treaty
was
soon
concluded
by
which
the
knights
of
malta
gave
up
to
france
the
sovereignty
of
malta
and
the
dependent
islands
thus
france
gained
possession
of
the
best
harbour
in
the
mediterranean
and
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
world
it
required
the
ascendency
of
bonaparte
to
obtain
it
without
fighting
and
it
necessitated
also
the
risk
of
losing
some
precious
days
with
the
english
in
pursuit
of
him
the
french
fleet
weighed
anchor
on
the
of
june
after
a
stay
of
ten
days
the
essential
point
now
was
not
to
fall
in
with
the
english
nelson
having
refitted
at
the
islands
of
pierre
had
returned
on
june
to
toulon
but
the
french
squadron
had
been
gone
twelve
days
he
had
run
from
toulon
to
the
roads
of
and
from
the
roads
of
tagliamon
to
naples
where
he
had
arrived
on
june
at
the
very
moment
when
bonaparte
was
leaving
malta
learning
that
the
french
had
been
seen
off
malta
he
followed
determined
to
attack
them
if
he
could
overtake
them
at
one
moment
the
english
squadron
was
only
a
few
leagues
distant
from
the
immense
french
convoy
and
neither
party
was
aware
of
it
nelson
supposing
that
the
french
were
bound
for
egypt
made
sail
for
alexandria
and
arrived
there
before
them
at
not
finding
them
he
flew
to
the
dardanelles
to
seek
them
there
by
a
singular
fate
it
was
not
till
two
days
afterwards
that
the
french
expedition
came
in
sight
of
alexandria
on
the
of
july
which
was
very
nearly
six
weeks
since
it
sailed
from
toulon
bonaparte
immediately
sent
on
shore
for
the
french
consul
he
learned
that
the
english
had
made
their
appearance
two
days
before
and
supposing
them
to
be
not
far
off
he
resolved
that
very
moment
to
attempt
a
landing
it
was
impossible
to
enter
the
harbour
of
alexandria
for
the
place
appeared
disposed
to
defend
itself
it
became
necessary
therefore
to
land
at
some
distance
on
the
neighbouring
coast
at
an
inlet
called
the
creek
of
the
marabou
the
wind
blew
violently
and
the
sea
broke
with
fury
over
the
reefs
on
the
shore
it
was
near
the
close
of
the
day
but
bonaparte
gave
the
signal
and
resolved
to
go
on
shore
immediately
he
was
the
first
to
disembark
and
with
great
difficulty
four
or
five
thousand
men
were
landed
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
the
following
night
bonaparte
resolved
to
march
forthwith
for
alexandria
in
order
to
surprise
the
place
and
to
prevent
the
turks
from
making
preparations
for
defence
the
troops
instantly
commenced
their
march
not
a
horse
was
yet
landed
the
staff
of
bonaparte
and
caffarelli
himself
notwithstanding
his
wooden
leg
had
to
walk
four
or
five
leagues
over
the
sands
and
came
at
daybreak
within
sight
of
alexandria
that
ancient
city
no
longer
possessed
its
magnificent
edifices
its
innumerable
houses
and
its
immense
population
of
it
was
in
ruins
the
turks
the
wealthy
egyptians
the
european
merchants
dwelt
in
the
modern
town
which
was
the
only
part
preserved
a
few
arabs
lived
among
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
city
an
old
wall
flanked
by
towers
enclosed
the
new
and
the
old
town
and
all
around
extended
those
sands
which
in
egypt
are
sure
to
advance
wherever
civilisation
recedes
the
four
thousand
french
led
by
bonaparte
arrived
there
at
daybreak
upon
this
sandy
beach
they
met
with
arabs
only
who
after
firing
a
few
fled
to
the
desert
napoleon
divided
his
men
into
three
columns
bon
with
the
first
column
marched
on
the
right
towards
the
rosetta
gate
kléber
with
the
second
marched
in
the
centre
towards
the
gate
of
the
catacombs
the
arabs
and
the
turks
excellent
soldiers
behind
a
wall
kept
up
a
steady
fire
but
the
french
mounted
with
ladders
and
got
over
the
old
wall
kléber
was
the
first
who
fell
seriously
wounded
on
the
forehead
the
arabs
were
driven
from
ruin
to
ruin
as
far
as
the
new
town
and
the
combat
seemed
likely
to
be
continued
from
street
to
street
and
to
become
sanguinary
when
a
turkish
captain
served
as
a
mediator
for
negotiating
an
arrangement
bonaparte
declared
that
he
had
not
come
to
ravage
the
country
or
to
wrest
it
from
its
ruler
but
merely
to
deliver
it
from
the
domination
of
the
mamluks
and
to
revenge
the
outrages
which
they
had
committed
against
france
he
promised
that
the
authorities
of
the
country
should
be
upheld
that
the
ceremonies
of
religion
should
continue
to
be
performed
as
before
that
property
should
be
respected
on
these
conditions
the
resistance
ceased
and
the
french
were
masters
of
alexandria
meanwhile
the
remainder
of
the
army
had
landed
it
was
immediately
necessary
to
decide
where
to
place
the
squadron
safely
whether
in
the
harbour
or
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
roads
to
form
at
alexandria
an
administration
adapted
to
the
manners
of
the
country
and
also
to
devise
a
plan
of
invasion
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
egypt
at
this
period
the
population
of
egypt
was
like

covered

nations

the
conquerors
of

on

arrival
of

the
kopts
amounted
at
most
to
two
hundred
thousand
poor
despised
brutalised
they
had
devoted
themselves
like
all
the
proscribed
classes
to
the
most
ignoble
occupations
the
arabs
formed
almost
the
entire
mass
of
the
population
their
condition
was
infinitely
varied
some
were
of
high
birth
carrying
back
their
pedigree
to
muhammed
himself
and
some
were
landed
proprietors
possessing
traces
of
arabian
knowledge
and
combining
with
nobility
the
functions
of
the
priesthood
and
the
magistracy
who
under

were

the

in

they
represented
the
country
when
its
tyrants
wished
to
address
themselves
to
it
in
the
mosques
they
formed
a
kind
of
university
in
which
they
taught
the
religion
and
the
morality
of
the
koran
and
a
little
philosophy
and
jurisprudence
the
great

constituted
the
foremost

body
in

east
next
to
these
grandees
came
the
smaller
landholders
composing
the
second
and
more
numerous
class
of
the
arabs
then
the
great
mass
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
sunk
into
the
state
of
absolute
helots
these
last
were
hired
peasants
or
fellahs
who
cultivated
the
land
and
lived
in
abject
poverty
there
was
also
a
class
of
arabs
namely
the
bedouins
or
rovers
who
would
never
attach
themselves
to
the
soil
but
were
the
children
of
the
desert
these
wandering
arabs
divided
into
tribes
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
numbered
nearly
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
and
could
furnish
from
twenty
to
thousand
horse
they
were
brave

fit
only
to
harass
the
enemy
not
to
fight
him
the
third
and
last
race
was
that
of
the
turks
but
it
was
not
more
numerous
than
the
kopts
amounting
to
about
two
hundred
thousand
souls
at
most
and
was
divided
into
turks
and
mamluks
the
turks
were
nearly
all
enrolled
in
the
list
of
janizaries
but
it
is
well
known
that
they
frequently
had
their
names
inscribed
in
those
lists
that
they
might
enjoy
the
privileges
of
janizaries
and
that
a
very
small
number
of
them
were
really
in
the
service
very
few
of
them
composed
the
military
force
of
the
pasha
this
pasha
sent
from
constantinople
was
the
representative
in
egypt
but
escorted
by
only
a
few
janizaries
he
found
his
authority
invalidated
by
the
very
precautions
which
sultan
selim
had
formerly
taken
to
preserve
it
that
sultan
judging
that
egypt
was
likely
from
its
remoteness
to
throw
off
the
dominion
of
constantinople
and
that
a
clever
and
ambitious
pasha
might
create
there
an
independent
empire
had
as
we
have

devised
a
plan
to
frustrate
such
a
motive
should
it
exist
by
instituting
a
mamluk
soldiery
but
it
was
the
mamluks
and
not
the
pasha
who
rendered
themselves
independent
of
constantinople
and
the
masters
of
egypt
egypt
was
at
this
time
an
absolute
feudality
like
that
of
europe
in
the
middle
ages
it
exhibited
at
once
a
conquered
people
a
conquering
soldiery
in
rebellion
against
its
sovereign
and
lastly
an
ancient
degenerate
class
who
served
and
were
in
the
pay
of
the
strongest
two
beys
superior
to
the
rest
ruled
egypt
the
one
ibrahim
bey
wealthy
crafty
and
powerful
the
other
murad
bey
intrepid
valiant
and
full
of
ardour
they
had
agreed
upon
a
sort
of
division
of
authority
by
which
ibrahim
bey
had
the
civil
and
murad
bey
the
military
power
it
was
the
business
of
the
latter
to
fight
he
excelled
in
it
and
he
possessed
the
affection
of
the
who
were
all
eager
to
follow
him
bonaparte
immediately
perceived
the
line
of
policy
which
he
had
to
pursue
in
egypt
he
must
in
the
first
place
wrest
that
country
from
its
real
masters
the
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
fight
them
and
to
destroy
them
by
arms
and
by
policy
he
had
moreover
strong
reasons
to
urge
against
them
for
they
had
never
ceased
to
the
french
as
for
the
porte
it
was
requisite
that
he
should
not
appear
to
attack
its
sovereignty
but
affect
on
the
contrary
to
respect
it
in
the
state
to
which
it
was
reduced
that
sovereignty
was
not
to
be
dreaded
and
he
could
treat
with
the
porte
either
for
the
cession
of
egypt
by
granting
certain
advantages
elsewhere
or
for
a
partition
of
authority
in
which
there
would
be
nothing
detrimental
for
the
french
in
leaving
the
pasha
at
cairo
and
transferring
to
themselves
the
power
of
the
mamluks
would
not
occasion
much
regret
as
for
the
inhabitants
in
order
to
make
sure
of
their
attachment
it
would
be
requisite
to
win
over
the
arab
population
by
respecting
the
sheikhs
by
flattering
their
old
pride
by
increasing
their
power
by
encouraging
their
secret
desire
for
the
of
their
ancient
glories
bonaparte
reckoned
upon
ruling
the
land
and
attaching
it
entirely
to
him
by
afterwards
sparing
persons
and
property
among
a
people
accustomed
to
consider
conquest
as
conferring
a
right
to
murder
pillage
and
devastate
he
would
create
a
sentiment
that
would
be
most
advantageous
to
the
french
army
if
furthermore
the
french
were
to
respect
women
and
the
prophet
the
conquest
of
hearts
would
be
as
firmly
secured
as
that
of
the
soil
napoleon
conducted
himself
agreeably
to
these
conclusions
which
were
equally
just
and
profound
he
immediately
made
his
plans
for
establishing
the
french
authority
at
alexandria
and
for
quitting
the
delta
and
gaining
possession
of
cairo
the
capital
of
egypt
it
was
the
month
of
july
the
nile
was
about
to
inundate
the
country
he
was
anxious
to
reach
cairo
before
the
inundation
and
to
employ
the
time
during
which
it
should
last
in
establishing
himself
there
he
ordered
everything
at
alexandria
to
be
left
in
the
same
state
as
formerly
that
the
religious
exercises
should
be
continued
and
that
justice
should
be
administered
as
before
by
the
cadis
his
intention
was
merely
to
possess
himself
of
the
rights
of
the
mamluks
and
to
appoint
a
commissioner
to
levy
the
accustomed
imposts
he
caused
a
divan
or
municipal
council
composed
of
the
sheikhs
and
principal
persons
of
alexandria
to
be
formed
in
order
to
consult
them
on
all
the
measures
which
the
french
authority
would
have
to
take
he
left
three
thousand
men
in
garrison
in
alexandria
and
gave
the
command
of
it
to
kléber
whose
wound
was
liable
to
keep
him
in
a
state
of
inactivity
for
a
month
or
two
he
directed
a
young
frenchman
of
extraordinary
merit
and
who
gave
promise
of
becoming
a
great
engineer
to
put
alexandria
in
a
state
of
defence
and
to
construct
there
all
the
necessary
works
this
was
colonel
cretin
who
in
a
short
time
and
at
a
small
expense
executed
superb
works
at
alexandria
bonaparte
then
ordered
the
fleet
to
be
put
in
a
place
of
security
it
was
a
question
whether
the
large
ships
could
enter
the
port
of
alexandria
a
commission
of
naval
officers
was
appointed
to
sound
the
harbour
and
make
a
report
meanwhile
the
fleet
was
anchored
in
the
road
of
abukir
and
bonaparte
ordered
brueys
to
see
to
it
that
this
question
should
be
speedily
decided
and
to
proceed
to
corfu
if
it
should
be
ascertained
that
the
ships
could
not
enter
the
harbour
of
alexandria
after
he
had
attended
to
all
these
matters
he
made
preparations
for
marching
a
considerable
flotilla
laden
with
provisions
artillery
ammunition
and
baggage
was
to
run
along
the
coast
to
the
rosetta
mouth
enter
the
nile
and
ascend
the
river
at
the
same
time
as
the
french
army
he
then
set
out
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
which
after
leaving
the
two
garrisons
in
malta
and
alexandria
was
about
thirty
thousand
strong
he
had
ordered
his
flotilla
to
proceed
as
high
as
ramanieh
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
there
he
purposed
to
join
it
and
to
proceed
up
the
nile
parallel
with
it
in
order
to
quit
the
delta
and
to
reach
upper
egypt
or
bahireh
there
were
two
roads
from
alexandria
to
ramanieh
one
through
an
inhabited
country
along
the
and
the
nile
and
the
other
shorter
and
as
the
bird
flies
but
across
the
desert
of
damanhour
bonaparte
without
hesitation
chose
the
shorter
it
was
of
consequence
that
he
should
reach
cairo
as
speedily
as
possible
marched
with
the
advanced
guard
and
the
main
body
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
few
leagues
they
started
on
the
of
july
when
the
soldiers
found
themselves
amidst
this
boundless
plain
with
a
shifting
sand
beneath
their
feet
a
scorching
sun
over
their
heads
without
water
without
shade
with
nothing
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
but
rare
clumps
of
seeing
no
living
creatures
but
small
troops
of
arab
horsemen
who
appeared
and
disappeared
at
the
horizon
and
sometimes
concealed
themselves
behind
to
murder
the
laggards
they
were
profoundly
dejected
they
found
all
the
wells
which
at
intervals
border
the
road
through
the
desert
destroyed
by
the
arabs
there
were
left
only
a
few
drops
of
brackish
water
wholly
insufficient
for
quenching
their
thirst
illustration
street
dogs
they
had
been
informed
that
they
should
find
refreshments
at
damanhour
but
they
met
with
nothing
there
but
miserable
huts
and
could
procure
neither
bread
nor
wine
only
lentils
in
great
abundance
and
a
little
water
they
were
obliged
to
proceed
again
into
the
desert
bonaparte
saw
the
brave
lannes
and
murat
take
off
their
hats
dash
them
on
the
sand
and
trample
them
under
foot
he
however
overawed
all
his
presence
imposed
silence
and
sometimes
restored
cheerfulness
the
soldiers
would
not
impute
their
sufferings
to
him
but
grew
angry
with
those
who
took
pleasure
in
observing
the
country
on
seeing
the
men
of
science
stop
to
examine
the
slightest
ruins
they
said
they
should
not
have
been
there
but
for
them
and
revenged
themselves
with
witticisms
after
their
fashion
caffarelli
in
particular
brave
as
a
grenadier
and
inquisitive
as
a
scholar
was
considered
by
them
as
the
man
who
had
deceived
the
general
and
drawn
him
into
this
distant
country
as
he
had
lost
a
leg
on
the
rhine
they
said
for
his
part
laughs
at
this
he
has
one
foot
in
at
last
after
severe
hardships
endured
at
first
with
impatience
and
afterwards
with
gaiety
and
fortitude
they
reached
the
nile
on
the
of
july
after
a
march
of
four
days
at
the
sight
of
the
nile
and
of
the
water
so
much
longed
for
the
soldiers
flung
themselves
into
it
and
bathing
in
its
waves
forgot
their
fatigues
division
which
from
the
had
become
the
saw
two
or
three
hundred
mamluks
galloping
before
it
whom
they
dispersed
by
a
few
volleys
of
grape
these
were
the
first
that
had
been
seen
which
warned
the
french
that
they
would
speedily
fall
in
with
the
hostile
army
the
brave
murad
bey
having
received
the
intelligence
of
the
arrival
of
bonaparte
was
actually
collecting
his
forces
around
cairo
until
they
should
have
assembled
he
was
hovering
with
a
thousand
horse
about
the
army
in
order
to
watch
its
march
the
army
waited
at
ramanieh
for
the
arrival
of
the
flotilla
it
rested
till
july
and
set
out
on
the
same
day
for
chebreiss
murad
bey
was
waiting
there
with
his
mamluks
the
flotilla
which
had
set
out
first
and
preceded
the
army
found
itself
engaged
before
it
could
be
supported
murad
bey
had
a
flotilla
also
and
from
the
shore
he
joined
his
fire
to
that
of
his
light
egyptian
vessels
the
french
flotilla
had
to
sustain
a
very
severe
combat
perrée
a
naval
officer
who
commanded
it
displayed
extraordinary
courage
he
was
supported
by
the
cavalry
who
had
come
dismounted
to
egypt
and
who
until
they
could
equip
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
mamluks
had
taken
their
passage
by
water
two
gunboats
were
retaken
from
the
enemy
and
perrée
was
repulsed
at
that
moment
the
army
came
up
it
was
composed
of
five
divisions
and
had
not
yet
been
in
action
with
its
singular
enemies
to
swiftness
and
the
charge
of
horse
and
to
it
would
be
necessary
to
oppose
the
immobility
of
the
his
long
bayonet
and
masses
presenting
a
front
on
every
side
bonaparte
formed
his
five
divisions
into
five
squares
in
the
centre
of
which
were
placed
the
baggage
and
the
staff
the
artillery
was
at
the
angles
the
five
divisions
flanked

another
murad
bey
flung
upon
these
living
citadels
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
intrepid
horse
who
bearing
down
with
loud
shouts
and
at
full
gallop
discharging
their
pistols
and
then
drawing
their
formidable
sabres
threw
themselves
upon
the
front
of
the
squares
encountering
everywhere
a
hedge
of
bayonets
and
a
tremendous
fire
they
hovered
about
the
french
ranks
fell
before
them
or
scampered
off
in
the
plain
at
the
utmost
speed
of
their
horses
murad
bey
after
losing
a
few
of
his
bravest
men
retired
for
the
purpose
of
proceeding
to
the
point
of
the
delta
and
awaiting
them
near
cairo
at
the
head
of
all
his
forces
this
action
was
sufficient
to
familiarise
the
army
with
this
new
kind
of
enemy
and
to
suggest
to
bonaparte
the
kind
of
tactics
which
he
ought
to
employ
with
them
he
pursued
his
march
towards
cairo
and
the
flotilla
ascended
the
nile
abreast
of
the
army
it
marched
without
intermission
during
the
following
days
and
although
the
soldiers
had
fresh
hardships
to
endure
they
kept
close
to
the
nile
and
could
bathe
every
night
in
its
waters
the
army
now
approached
cairo
where
the
decisive
battle
was
to
be
fought
murad
bey
had
collected
here
the
greater
part
of
his
mamluks
nearly
ten
thousand
in
number
and
they
were
attended
by
double
the
number
of
fellahs
to
whom
arms
were
given
and
who
were
obliged
to
fight
behind
the
intrenchments
he
had
also
assembled
some
thousands
of
janizaries
or
spahis
dependent
on
the
pasha
who
notwithstanding
letter
of
conciliation
had
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
join
his
oppressors
murad
bey
had
made
preparations
for
defence
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
great
capital
cairo
is
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
on
the
opposite
bank
murad
bey
had
pitched
his
tent
in
a
long
plain
extending
from
the
river
to
the
pyramids
of
gizeh
on
the
of
july
the
french
army
set
itself
in
motion
before
daybreak
as
they
approached
they
saw
the
minarets
of
cairo
shooting
up
they
saw
the
pyramids
increase
in
height
they
saw
the
swarming
multitude
which
guarded
embabeh
they
saw
the
glistening
arms
of
ten
thousand
horsemen
resplendent
with
gold
and
steel
and
forming
an
immense
line
illustration
gathering
dates
the
face
of
bonaparte
beamed
with
enthusiasm
he
began
to
gallop
before
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
and
pointing
to
the
pyramids
he
exclaimed
that
from
the
summit
of
those
pyramids
forty
centuries
have
their
eyes
fixed
upon
in
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
as
it
was
called
the
force
of
sixty
thousand
men
was
almost
completely
annihilated
the
mamluks
bewildered
by
european
tactics
impaled
themselves
upon
the
bayonets
of
the
french
squares
fifteen
thousand
men
of
all
arms
fell
upon
the
field
the
battle
had
cost
the
french
scarcely
a
hundred
killed
and
wounded
for
if
defeat
is
terrible
for
broken
squares
the
loss
is
insignificant
for
victorious
squares
the
mamluks
had
lost
their
best
horsemen
by
fire
or
water
their
forces
were
dispersed
and
the
possession
of
cairo
secured
the
capital
was
in
extraordinary
agitation
it
contained
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
many
of
whom
were
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
excesses
and
intending
to
profit
by
the
tumult
to
pillage
the
rich
palaces
of
the
beys
the
french
flotilla
however
had
not
yet
ascended
the
nile
and
there
was
no
means
of
crossing
to
take
possession
of
cairo
some
french
traders
who
happened
to
be
there
were
sent
to
bonaparte
by
the
sheikhs
to
arrange
concerning
the
occupation
of
the
city
he
procured
a
few
light
boats
or
djerms
and
sent
across
the
river
a
detachment
of
troops
which
at
once
restored
tranquillity
and
secured
persons
and
property
from
the
fury
of
the
populace
bonaparte
established
his
headquarters
at
gizeh
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
where
murad
bey
had
an
imposing
residence
a
considerable
store
of
provisions
was
found
both
at
gizeh
and
at
embabeh
and
the
soldiers
could
make
amends
for
their
long
privations
no
sooner
had
he
settled
in
cairo
than
he
hastened
to
pursue
the
same
policy
which
he
had
already
adopted
at
alexandria
and
by
which
he
hoped
to
gain
the
country
the
essential
point
was
to
obtain
from
the
sheikhs
of
the
mosque
of
a
declaration
in
favour
of
the
french
it
corresponded
to
a
papal
bull
among
christians
on
this
occasion
bonaparte
exerted
his
utmost
address
and
was
completely
successful
the
great
sheikhs
issued
the
desired
declaration
and
exhorted
the
egyptians
to
submit
to
the
envoy
of
god
who
reverenced
the
prophet
and
who
had
come
to
deliver
his
children
from
the
tyranny
of
the
mamluks
bonaparte
established
a
divan
at
cairo
as
he
had
done
at
alexandria
composed
of
the
principal
sheikhs
and
the
most
distinguished
inhabitants
this
divan
or
municipal
council
was
intended
to
serve
him
in
gaining
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
by
consulting
it
and
learning
from
it
all
the
details
of
the
internal
administration
it
was
agreed
that
similar
assemblies
should
be
established
in
all
the
provinces
and
that
these
subordinate
divans
should
send
deputies
to
the
divan
of
cairo
which
would
thus
be
the
great
national
divan
bonaparte
resolved
to
leave
the
administration
of
justice
to
the
cadis
in
execution
of
his
scheme
of
succeeding
to
the
rights
of
the
mamluks
he
seized
their
property
and
caused
the
taxes
previously
imposed
to
continue
to
be
levied
for
the
benefit
of
the
french
army
for
this
purpose
it
was
requisite
that
he
should
have
the
kopts
at
his
disposal
he
omitted
nothing
to
attach
them
to
him
holding
out
hopes
to
them
of
an
amelioration
of
their
condition
he
sent
generals
with
detachments
down
the
nile
to
complete
the
occupation
of
the
delta
which
the
army
had
merely
traversed
and
sent
others
towards
the
upper
nile
to
take
possession
of
middle
egypt
desaix
was
placed
with
a
division
at
the
entrance
of
upper
egypt
which
he
was
to
conquer
from
murad
bey
as
soon
as
the
waters
of
the
nile
should
subside
in
the
autumn
each
of
the
generals
furnished
with
detailed
instructions
was
to
repeat
in
the
country
what
had
been
done
at
alexandria
and
at
cairo

bonaparte
was
also
attentive
to
keep
up
the
relations
with
the
neighbouring
countries
in
order
to
uphold
and
to
appropriate
to
himself
the
rich

appointed

an
officer
annually
chosen
at

protect

wrote
to

to
inform

that
the

was
appointed

as
well
as

and
damascus
to
assure
them
of
the
good
disposition
of

towards

were
struck
by
the
character
of
the
young
conqueror
they
could
not
comprehend
how
it
was
that
the
mortal
who
wielded
the
thunderbolt
should
be
so
merciful
they
called
him
the
worthy
son
of
the
prophet

praise

carrying
out
his
policy
of
conciliating
the
natives
was
present
at
the
nile
festival
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
in
egypt
it
was
on
the
of
august
that
this
festival
was
held
bonaparte
had
ordered
the
whole
army
to
be
under
arms
and
had
drawn
it
up
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
an
immense
concourse
of
people
had
assembled
who
beheld
with
joy
the
brave
man
of
the
west
attending
their
festivals
it
was
by
such
means
that
the
young
general
as
profound
a
politician
as
he
was
a
great
captain
contrived
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
people
while
he
flattered
their
prejudices
for
the
moment
he
laboured
to
diffuse
among
them
the
light
of
science
by
the
creation
of
the
celebrated
institute
of
egypt
he
collected
the
men
of
science
and
the
artists
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
associating
with
them
some
of
the
best
educated
of
his
officers
established
the
institute
to
which
he
appropriated
a
revenue
and
one
of
the
most
spacious
palaces
in
cairo
the
conquest
of
the
provinces
of
lower
and
middle
egypt
had
been
effected
without
difficulty
and
had
cost
only
a
few
skirmishes
with
the
arabs
a
forced
march
upon
belbeys
had
been
sufficient
to
drive
ibrahim
bey
into
syria
where
desaix
awaited
the
autumn
for
wresting
upper
egypt
from
murad
bey
who
had
retired
thither
with
the
wrecks
of
his
army
fortune
was
meanwhile
preparing
for
bonaparte
the
most
terrible
of
all
reverses
on
leaving
alexandria
he
had
earnestly
recommended
to
admiral
brueys
to
secure
his
squadron
from
the
english
either
by
taking
it
into
the
harbour
of
alexandria
or
by
proceeding
with
it
to
corfu
and
he
had
particularly
enjoined
him
not
to
leave
it
in
the
road
of
abukir
for
it
was
much
better
to
fall
in
with
an
enemy
when
under
sail
than
to
receive
him
at
anchor
a
warm
discussion
had
arisen
on
the
question
whether
the
ships
of
and
guns
could
be
carried
into
the
harbour
of
alexandria
as
to
the
smaller
ships
there
was
no
doubt
but
the
larger
would
require
lightening
so
much
as
to
enable
them
to
draw
three
feet
less
water
for
this
purpose
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
out
their
guns
or
to
construct
floats
on
such
conditions
admiral
brueys
resolved
not
to
take
his
squadron
into
the
harbour
the
time
which
he
spent
either
in
sounding
the
channels
to
the
harbour
or
in
waiting
for
news
from
cairo
caused
his
own
destruction
admiral
brueys
was
moored
in
the
road
of
abukir
this
road
is
a
very
regular
semicircle
and
his
thirteen
ships
formed
a
line
parallel
to
the
shore
and
so
disposed
that
he
believed
no
british
ship
could
pass
between
him
and
the
shore
if
an
attack
were
made
nelson
after
visiting
the
archipelago
and
returning
to
the
adriatic
naples
and
sicily
had
at
length
obtained
the
certain
knowledge
of
the
landing
of
the
french
at
alexandria
he
immediately
steered
in
that
direction
in
order
to
seek
and
put
to
flight
their
squadron
he
sent
a
frigate
to
look
out
for
it
and
to
reconnoitre
its
position
the
english
frigate
having
made
her
observations
rejoined
nelson
who
being
informed
of
all
the
particulars
immediately
stood
in
for
abukir
and
arrived
there
august
at
about
six
in
the
evening
admiral
brueys
was
at
dinner
he
immediately
ordered
the
signal
for
battle
to
be
given
but
so
unprepared
was
the
squadron
to
receive
the
enemy
that
the
hammocks
were
not
stowed
away
on
board
any
of
the
ships
and
part
of
the
crews
were
on
shore
the
admiral
despatched
officers
to
send
the
seamen
on
board
and
to
demand
part
of
those
who
were
in
the
transports
he
had
no
conception
that
nelson
would
dare
to
attack
him
the
same
evening
and
conceived
that
he
should
have
time
to
receive
the
reinforcements
for
which
he
had
applied
nelson
resolved
to
attack
immediately
and
to
push
in
between
the
french
ships
and
the
shore
at
all
hazards
this
time
said
he
shall
have
gained
a
peerage
or
westminster
the
number
of
vessels
was
equal
on
both
sides
namely
thirteen
ships
of
war
the
engagement
lasted
upwards
of
fifteen
hours
all
the
crews
performed
prodigies
of
valour
the
brave
captain
du
had
two
of
his
limbs
shot
off
he
ordered
snuff
to
be
brought
him
and
remained
on
his
and
like
brueys
waited
till
a
despatched
him
the
entire
french
squadron
excepting
the
two
ships
and
two
frigates
carried
off
by
villeneuve
was
destroyed
nelson
had
suffered
so
severely
that
he
could
not
pursue
the
fugitives
such
was
the
famous
battle
of
abukir
the
most
disastrous
that
the
french
had
ever
sustained
and
involved
the
most
consequences
the
fleet
which
had
carried
the
french
to
egypt
which
might
have
served
to
succour
or
to
recruit
them
which
was
to
second
their
movements
on
the
coast
of
syria
had
there
been
any
to
execute
which
was
to
overawe
the
porte
to
force
it
to
put
up
with
false
reasoning
and
to
oblige
it
to
wink
at
the
invasion
of
egypt
which
finally
in
case
of
reverses
was
to
convey
the
french
back
to
their
country
that
fleet
was
destroyed
the
french
ships
were
burned
the
news
of
this
disaster
spread
rapidly
in
egypt
and
for
a
moment
filled
the
army
with
despair
bonaparte
received
the
tidings
with
imperturbable
composure
he
said
must
die
in
this
country
or
get
out
of
it
as
great
as
the
he
wrote
to
kléber
will
oblige
us
to
do
greater
things
than
we
intended
we
must
hold
ourselves
in
the
great
soul
of
kléber
was
worthy
of
this
language
replied
kléber
must
do
great
things
i
am
preparing
my
the
courage
of
these
men
supported
the
army
and
restored
its
confidence
bonaparte
strove
to
divert
the
thoughts
of
the
soldiers
by
various
expeditions
and
soon
made
them
forget
this
disaster
on
the
festival
of
the
foundation
of
the
republic
he
endeavoured
to
give
a
new
stimulus
to
their
imagination
he
engraved
on
pillar
the
names
of
the
first
forty
soldiers
slain
in
egypt
they
were
the
forty
who
had
fallen
in
the
attack
on
alexandria
and
the
names
of
these
men
sprung
from
the
villages
of
france
were
thus
associated
with
the
immortality
of
pompey
and
alexander
bonaparte
after
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
found
himself
master
of
egypt
he
began
to
establish
himself
there
and
sent
his
generals
into
the
provinces
to
complete
their
conquest
desaix
placed
at
the
entrance
of
upper
egypt
with
a
division
of
about
three
thousand
men
was
directed
to
reduce
the
remnants
of
murad
force
in
that
province
it
was
in
the
preceding
year
october
at
the
moment
when
the
inundation
was
over
that
desaix
had
commenced
his
expedition
the
enemy
had
retired
before
him
and
did
not
wait
for
him
till
he
reached
sediman
there
on
october
desaix
fought
a
sanguinary
battle
with
the
desperate
remainder
of
murad
forces
two
thousand
french
had
to
combat
with
four
thousand
mamluks
and
eight
thousand
fellahs
intrenched
in
the
village
of
sediman
the
battle
was
conducted
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
the
pyramids
and
like
all
those
fought
in
egypt
the
fellahs
were
behind
the
walls
of
the
village
and
the
horse
in
the
plain
the
field
of
battle
was
thickly
strewn
with
slain
the
french
lost
three
hundred
men
desaix
continued
his
march
during
the
whole
winter
and
after
a
series
of
actions
reduced
upper
egypt
as
far
as
the
cataracts
he
made
himself
equally
feared
for
his
bravery
and
beloved
for
his
clemency
in
cairo
bonaparte
had
been
named
sultan

had
meanwhile
marched
to
belbeys
to
drive
ibrahim

he
had
collected
by
the
way
the
wrecks
of
the
caravan
of
mecca
plundered
by
the
arabs
returning
to
cairo
he
continued
to
establish
there
an
entirely
french
administration
thus
passed
the
winter
between
and
in
the
expectation
of
important
events
during
this
interval
bonaparte
received
intelligence
of
the
declaration
of
war
by
the
porte
and
of
the
preparations
which
it
was
making
against
him
with
the
aid
of
the
english
two
armies
were
being
formed
one
at
rhodes
the
other
in
syria
these
two
armies
were
to
act
simultaneously
in
the
spring
of
the
one
by
landing
at
abukir
near
alexandria
the
other
by
crossing
the
desert
which
separates
syria
from
egypt
bonaparte
was
instantly
aware
of
his
position
and
determined
as
was
his
custom
to
disconcert
the
enemy
and
to
forestall
any
offensive
movement
by
a
sudden
attack
he
could
not
cross
the
desert
which
parts
egypt
from
syria
in
summer
and
he
resolved
to
avail
himself
of
the
winter
for
destroying
the
assemblages
of
troops
forming
at
acre
at
damascus
and
in
the
principal
towns

far
as
the
fort
of
el
arish
which
is
the
key
to
egypt
on
the
side
next
to
syria
bonaparte
resolved
to
act
immediately
he
was
in
communication
with
the
tribes
of
the
lebanon
the
druses
christian
tribes
the
mutualis
and
schismatic
muhammedans
offered
him
assistance
and
ardently
wished
for
his
coming
by
a
sudden
assault
on
jaffa
acre
and
some
other
badly
fortified
places
he
might
in
a
short
time
gain
possession
of

add
this
fine
conquest
to
that
of
egypt
make
himself
master
of

he
was
of
the
nile
and
thus
command

bonaparte
commenced
his
march
very
early
in
february
at
the
head
of
and
divisions
about
thirteen
thousand
strong
he
arrived
before
the
fort
el
arish
on
february
and
after
a
slight
resistance
the
garrison
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
to
the
number
of
thirteen
hundred
men
ibrahim
bey
having
attempted
to
relieve
it
was
put
to
flight
and
after
a
severe
march
across
the
desert
they
reached
gaza
they
took
that
place
in
the
sight
of
djezzar
pasha
and
found
there
as
in
the
fort
of
el
arish
a
great
quantity
of
ammunition
and
provisions
from
gaza
the
army
proceeded
to
jaffa
the
ancient
joppa
where
it
arrived
on
march
this
place
was
surrounded
by
a
massive
wall
flanked
by
towers
and
it
contained
a
garrison
of
four
thousand
men
bonaparte
caused
a
breach
to
be
battered
in
the
wall
and
then
summoned
the
commandant
who
only
answered
by
cutting
off
the
head
of
the
messenger
the
assault
was
made
and
the
place
stormed
with
extraordinary
intrepidity
and
given
up
for
thirty
hours
to
pillage
and
massacre
here
too
was
found
a
considerable
quantity
of
artillery
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
there
were
some
thousands
of
prisoners
whom
the
general
could
not
despatch
to
egypt
because
he
had
not
the
ordinary
means
for
escorting
them
and
he
would
not
send
them
back
to
the
enemy
to
swell
their
ranks
bonaparte
decided
on
a
terrible
measure
the
most
cruel
act
of
his
life
transported
into
a
barbarous
country
he
had
adopted
its
manners
and
he
ordered
all
the
prisoners
to
be
put
to
death
the
army
consummated
with
obedience
but
with
a
sort
of
horror
the
execution
that
was
commanded
bonaparte
then
advanced
upon
jean
the
ancient
ptolemais
situated
at
the
foot
of
mount
carmel
it
was
the
only
place
that
could
now
stop
him
if
he
could
make
himself
master
of
this
fortress
syria
would
be
his
but
the
ferocious
djezzar
had
shut
himself
up
there
with
all
his
wealth
and
a
strong
garrison
and
he
also
reckoned
upon
support
from
sir
sidney
smith
then
cruising
off
that
coast
who
supplied
him
with
engineers
artillerymen
and
ammunition
it
was
probable
moreover
that
he
would
be
soon
relieved
by
the
turkish
army
collected
in
syria
which
was
advancing
from
damascus
to
cross
the
jordan
bonaparte
hastened
to
attack
the
place
in
hopes
of
taking
it
as
he
had
done
jaffa
before
it
was
reinforced
with
fresh
troops
and
before
the
english
had
time
to
improve
its
defences
the
trenches
were
immediately
opened
the
siege
artillery
sent
by
sea
from
alexandria
had
been
intercepted
by
sir
sidney
smith
who
captured
seven
vessels
out
of
the
nine
a
breach
was
effected
and
dispositions
were
made
for
the
assault
but
the
men
were
stopped
by
a
counterscarp
and
a
ditch
they
immediately
set
about
mining
the
operation
was
carried
on
under
the
fire
of
all
the
ramparts
and
of
the
fine
artillery
which
sir
sidney
smith
had
taken
from
the
french
the
mine
was
exploded
on
april
and
blew
up
only
a
portion
of
the
counterscarp

had
received
a
reinforcement
of
several
thousand
men
a
great
number
of
gunners
trained
after
the
european
fashion
and
immense
supplies
it
was
a
siege
on
a
large
scale
to
be
carried
on
with
thirteen
thousand
men
almost
entirely
destitute
of
artillery
it
was
necessary
to
open
a
new
mine
to
blow
up
the
entire
counterscarp
and
to
commence
another
covered
way
bonaparte
now
ordered
division
to
oppose
the
passage
of
the
jordan
by
the
army
coming
from
damascus
the
enemy
was
commanded
by
abd
allah

numbered
about
thousand
men

twelve
thousand

desperate
battle

been
before
acre
it
had
sustained
considerable
losses
and
it
would
have
been
imprudent
to
expose
it
to
more
the
plague
was
in
acre
and
the
army
had
caught
the
contagion
at
jaffa
the
season
for
landing
troops
approached
and
the
arrival
of
a
turkish
army
near
the
mouths
of
the
nile
was
expected
by
persisting
longer
bonaparte
was
liable
to
weaken
himself
to
such
a
degree
as
not
to
be
able
to
repulse
new
enemies
the
main
point
of
his
plan
was
effected
since
he
had
rendered
the
enemy
in
that
quarter
incapable
of
acting
he
now
commenced
his
march
to
recross
the
desert
bonaparte
at
length
reached
egypt
after
an
expedition
of
nearly
three
months
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
return
for
the
spirit
of
insurrection
had
spread
throughout
the
whole
delta
his
presence
produced
everywhere
submission
and
tranquillity
he
gave
orders
for
magnificent
festivities
at
cairo
to
celebrate
his
triumphs
in
syria
he
had
to
curb
not
only
the
inhabitants
but
his
own
generals
and
the
army
itself
a
deep
discontent
pervaded
it
they
had
been
for
a
whole
year
in
egypt
it
was
now
the
month
of
june
and
they
were
still
ignorant
of
what
was
passing
in
europe
and
of
the
disasters
of
france
they
merely
knew
that
the
continent
was
in
confusion
and
that
a
new
war
was
inevitable
bonaparte
impatiently
waited
for
further
particulars
that
he
might
decide
what
course
to
pursue
and
return
in
case
of
need
to
the
first
theatre
of
his
exploits
but
he
hoped
first
to
destroy
the
second
turkish
army
assembled
at
rhodes
the
very
speedy
landing
of
which
was
announced
this
army
put
on
board
numerous
transports
and
escorted
by
sir
sidney
squadron
appeared
on
july
in
sight
of
alexandria
and
came
to
anchor
in
the
road
of
abukir
where
the
french
squadron
had
been
destroyed
the
point
chosen
by
the
english
for
landing
was
the
peninsula
which
commands
the
entrance
to
the
road
and
bears
the
same
name
the
turks
landed
with
great
boldness
attacked
the
intrenchments
sword
in
hand
carried
them
and
made
themselves
masters
of
the
village
of
abukir
putting
to
death
the
garrison
the
village
being
taken
it
was
impossible
for
the
fort
to
hold
out
and
it
was
obliged
to
surrender
marmont
who
commanded
at
alexandria
left
the
city
at
the
head
of
twelve
hundred
men
to
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
troops
at
abukir
but
learning
that
the
turks
had
landed
in
considerable
numbers
he
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
throw
them
into
the
sea
by
a
bold
attack
and
returned
to
alexandria
leaving
them
to
establish
themselves
quietly
in
the
peninsula
of
abukir
illustration
cairo
from
the
left
bank
of
the
nile
the
turks
amounted
to
nearly
eighteen
thousand
infantry
they
had
no
cavalry
for
they
had
not
brought
more
than
three
hundred
horses
but
they
expected
the
arrival
of
murad
bey
who
was
to
leave
upper
egypt
skirt
the
desert
cross
the
oases
and
throw
himself
into
abukir
with
two
or
three
thousand
mamluks
when
bonaparte
was
informed
of
the
particulars
of
the
landing
he
immediately
left
cairo
and
made
from
that
city
to
alexandria
one
of
those
extraordinary
marches
of
which
he
had
given
so
many
examples
in
italy
he
took
with
him
the
divisions
of
lannes
bon
and
murat
he
had
ordered
desaix
to
evacuate
upper
egypt
and
kleber
and
régnier
who
were
in
the
delta
to
approach
abukir
he
had
chosen
the
point
of
birket
midway
between
alexandria
and
abukir
at
which
to
concentrate
his
forces
and
to
manouvre
according
to
circumstances
he
was
afraid
that
an
english
army
had
landed
with
the
turks
the
next
day
the
he
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
peninsula
bonaparte
made
his
dispositions
with
his
usual
promptitude
and
decision
he
ordered
general
d
with
some
battalions
to
march
to
the
hill
on
the
left
where
the
one
thousand
turks
were
posted
lannes
to
march
to
that
on
the
right
where
the
two
thousand
others
were
and
murat
who
was
at
the
centre
to
make
the
cavalry
file
on
the
rear
of
the
two
hills
marched
to
the
hill
on
the
left
and
boldly
ascended
it
murat
caused
it
to
be
turned
by
a
squadron
the
turks
at
sight
of
this
quitted
their
post
and
fell
in
with
the
cavalry
which
cut
them
to
pieces
and
drove
them
into
the
sea
into
which
they
chose
rather
to
throw
themselves
than
to
surrender
precisely
the
same
thing
was
done
on
the
right
lannes
attacked
the
two
thousand
janizaries
murat
turned
them
cut
them
in
pieces
and
drove
them
into
the
sea
and
lannes
then
moved
towards
the
centre
formed
by
a
village
and
attacked
it
in
front
the
turks
there
defended
themselves
bravely
reckoning
upon
assistance
from
the
second
line
a
column
did
in
fact
advance
from
the
camp
of
abukir
but
murat
who
had
already
filed
upon
the
rear
of
the
village
fell
sword
in
hand
upon
this
column
and
drove
it
back
into
abukir
infantry
and
that
of
lannes
entered
the
village
at
the
charge
step
driving
the
turks
out
of
it
who
were
pushed
in
all
directions
and
who
obstinately
refusing
to
surrender
had
no
retreat
but
the
sea
in
which
they
were
drowned
from
four
to
five
thousand
had
already
perished
in
this
manner
the
first
line
was
carried
object
was
accomplished
he
immediately
followed
up
his
success
with
desperate
fighting
to
complete
his
victory
on
the
moment
the
turks
affrighted
fled
on
all
sides
and
a
horrible
carnage
was
made
among
them
they
were
pursued
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
thrust
into
the
sea
more
than
twelve
thousand
corpses
were
floating
in
the
bay
of
abukir
and
two
or
three
thousand
more
had
perished
by
the
fire
or
by
the
sword
the
rest
shut
up
in
the
fort
had
no
rescue
but
the
clemency
of
the
conqueror
such
was
that
extraordinary
battle
in
which
a
hostile
army
was
entirely
destroyed
thus
either
by
the
expedition
to
syria
or
by
the
battle
of
abukir
egypt
was
delivered
at
least
for
a
time
from
the
forces
of
the
porte
having
arrived
in
the
summer
before
the
inundation
bonaparte
had
employed
the
first
moments
in
gaining
possession
of
alexandria
and
the
capital
which
he
had
secured
by
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
in
the
autumn
after
the
inundation
he
had
completed
the
conquest
of
the
delta
and
consigned
that
of
upper
egypt
to
desaix
in
the
winter
he
had
undertaken
the
expedition
to
syria
and
destroyed
turkish
army
at
mount
tabor
he
had
now
in
the
second
summer
just
destroyed
the
second
army
of
the
porte
at
abukir
the
time
had
thus
been
well
spent
and
while
victory
was
forsaking
in
europe
the
banners
of
france
she
adhered
to
them
in
africa
and
asia
the
tricolour
waved
triumphant
over
the
nile
and
the
jordan
and
over
the
places
which
were
the
cradle
of
the
christian
religion
bonaparte
was
as
yet
ignorant
of
what
was
passing
in
france
none
of
the
despatches
from
the
directory
or
from
his
brothers
had
reached
him
and
he
was
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
with
a
view
to
obtaining
some
intelligence
he
ordered
brigs
to
cruise
about
to
stop
all
merchantmen
and
to
gain
from
them
information
of
the
occurrences
in
europe
he
sent
to
the
turkish
fleet
a
flag
of
truce
which
under
the
pretext
of
negotiating
an
exchange
of
prisoners
was
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
news
sir
sidney
smith
stopped
this
messenger
treated
him
exceedingly
well
and
perceiving
that
bonaparte
was
ignorant
of
the
disasters
of
france
took
a
spiteful
pleasure
in
sending
him
a
packet
of
newspapers
the
messenger
returned
and
delivered
the
packet
to
bonaparte
the
latter
spent
the
whole
night
in
devouring
the
contents
of
those
papers
and
informing
himself
of
what
was
passing
in
his
own
country
his
determination
was
immediately
taken
and
he
resolved
to
embark
secretly
for
europe
and
on
august
taking
with
him
berthier
lannes
murât
andréossy
marmont
berthollet
and
monge
and
escorted
by
some
of
his
guides
he
proceeded
to
a
retired
spot
on
the
beach
where
boats
were
awaiting
them
they
got
into
them
and
went
on
board
the
frigates
and
they
set
sail
immediately
that
by
daylight
they
might
be
out
of
sight
of
the
english
cruisers
unfortunately
it
fell
calm
fearful
of
being
surprised
some
were
for
returning
to
alexandria
but
bonaparte
resolved
to
proceed
quiet
said
he
shall
pass
in
like
cæsar
he
reckoned
upon
his
fortune
menou
who
alone
had
been
initiated
into
the
secret
made
known
in
alexandria
the
departure
of
general
bonaparte
and
the
appointment
which
he
had
made
of
general
kléber
to
succeed
him
this
intelligence
caused
a
painful
surprise
throughout
the
army
the
most
opprobrious
epithets
were
applied
to
this
departure
they
did
not
consider
that
irresistible
impulse
of
patriotism
and
ambition
which
on
the
news
of
the
disasters
of
the
republic
had
urged
him
to
return
to
france
they
perceived
only
the
forlorn
state
in
which
he
had
left
the
unfortunate
army
which
had
felt
sufficient
confidence
in
his
genius
to
follow
him
kléber
was
not
fond
of
general
bonaparte
and
endured
his
ascendency
with
a
sort
of
impatience
and
now
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
quitted
the
banks
of
the
rhine
for
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
chief
command
did
not
counterbalance
the
necessity
of
remaining
in
egypt
for
he
took
no
pleasure
in
commanding
illustration
statue
of
general
kleber
at
strasburg
kléber
however
was
the
most
popular
of
the
generals
among
the
soldiery
his
name
was
hailed
by
them
with
entire
confidence
and
somewhat
cheered
them
for
the
loss
of
the
illustrious
commander
who
had
just
left
them
he
returned
to
cairo
assumed
the
command
with
a
sort
of
ostentation
and
took
possession
of
the
fine
arabian
mansion
which
his
predecessor
had
occupied
in
the
ezbekieh
place
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
solicitudes
of
the
chief
command
which
were
insupportable
to
him
the
new
dangers
with
which
the
turks
and
the
english
threatened
egypt
and
the
grief
of
exile
which
was
general
filled
his
soul
with
the
most
gloomy
discouragement
kléber
together
with
poussielgue
the
administrator
of
the
army
at
once
prepared
and
addressed
despatches
to
the
directory
placing
the
condition
of
the
troops
the
finances
and
the
number
of
the
enemy
in
the
most
melancholy
light
these
despatches
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
and
the
duplicate
reports
found
their
way
into
the
hands
of
bonaparte
himself
bonaparte
had
left
instructions
with
kléber
to
meet
every
possible
contingency
during
his
absence
even
to
the
necessity
of
an
evacuation
of
egypt
am
going
to
france
said
he
as
a
private
man
or
as
a
public
man
i
will
get
reinforcement
sent
to
you
but
if
by
next
spring
he
was
writing
in
august
you
have
received
no
supplies
no
instructions
if
the
plague
has
carried
off
more
than
fifteen
hundred
men
independently
of
losses
by
war
if
a
considerable
force
which
you
should
be
incapable
of
resisting
presses
you
hard
negotiate
with
the
vizier
consent
even
if
it
must
be
so
to
an
evacuation
subject
to
one
condition
that
of
referring
to
the
french
government
and
meanwhile
continue
to
occupy
you
will
thus
have
gained
time
and
it
is
impossible
that
during
the
interval
you
should
not
have
received
the
instructions
were
very
sound
but
the
case
foreseen
was
far
from
being
realised
at
the
time
when
kléber
determined
to
negotiate
for
the
evacuation
of
egypt
murad
bey
disheartened
was
a
fugitive
in
upper
egypt
with
a
few
mamluks
ibrahim
bey
who
under
the
government
of
the
mamluks
shared
the
sovereignty
with
him
was
then
in
lower
egypt
towards
the
frontier
of
he
had
four
hundred
horse
djezzar
pasha
was
shut
up
in
jean
and
so
far
from
preparing
a
reinforcement
of
men
for
the
army
of
the
grand
vizier
he
viewed
on
the
contrary
with
high
displeasure
the
approach
of
a
fresh
turkish
army
now
that
his
pashalik
was
delivered
from
the
french
as
for
the
grand
vizier
he
was
not
yet
across
the
taurus
the
english
had
their
troops
at
mahon
and
were
not
at
this
moment
aggressive
at
side
was
general
menou
who
viewed
everything
under
the
most
favourable
colours
and
believed
the
french
to
be
invincible
in
egypt
and
regarded
the
expedition
as
the
commencement
of
a
near
and
momentous
revolution
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
kléber
and
menou
were
both
honest
upright
men
but
one
wanted
to
leave
egypt
the
other
to
stay
in
it
the
clearest
and
most
authentic
returns
conveyed
to
them
totally
contrary
significations
misery
and
ruin
to
one
abundance
and
success
to
the
other
in
september
desaix
having
completed
the
conquest
and
subjugation
of
upper
egypt
had
left
two
movable
columns
for
the
pursuit
of
murad
bey
to
whom
he
had
offered
peace
on
condition
of
his
becoming
a
vassal
of
france
he
then
returned
to
cairo
by
the
order
of
kléber
who
wished
to
make
use
of
his
name
in
those
negotiations
into
which
he
was
about
to
enter
during
these
proceedings
the
army
of
the
grand
vizier
so
long
announced
was
slowly
advancing
sir
sidney
smith
who
convoyed
with
his
squadron
the
turkish
troops
destined
to
be
transported
by
sea
had
just
arrived
off
with
eight
thousand
janizaries
and
on
the
first
of
november
the
landing
of
the
first
division
of
four
thousand
janizaries
was
effected
at
the
first
tidings
of
this
disembarkation
kléber
had
despatched
desaix
with
a
column
of
three
thousand
men
but
the
latter
uselessly
sent
to
damietta
had
found
the
victory
won
the
turkish
division
having
been
completely
destroyed
by
general
verdier
and
the
french
filled
with
unbounded
confidence
this
brilliant
achievement
ought
to
have
served
to
encourage
kléber
unfortunately
he
was
swayed
at
once
by
his
own
lack
of
confidence
and
that
of
the
army
in
this
disposition
of
mind
kléber
had
sent
one
of
his
officers
to
the
vizier
who
had
entered
syria
to
make
new
overtures
of
peace
general
bonaparte
with
a
view
to
embroiling
the
vizier
with
the
english
had
previously
entertained
the
idea
of
setting
on
foot
negotiations
which
on
his
part
were
nothing
more
than
a
feint
his
overtures
had
been
received
with
great
distrust
and
pride
kléber
advances
met
with
a
favourable
reception
through
the
influence
of
sir
sidney
smith
who
was
preparing
to
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
affairs
of
egypt
this
officer
had
largely
contributed
to
prevent
the
success
of
the
siege
of
jean
he
was
proud
of
it
and
had
devised
a
de
by
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
weakness
to
wrest
from
the
french
their
valuable
conquest
with
this
view
he
had
disposed
the
grand
vizier
to
listen
to
the
overtures
of
kléber
kléber
on
his
part
despatched
desaix
and
poussielgue
as
negotiators
to
sir
sidney
smith
for
since
the
english
were
masters
of
the
sea
he
wished
to
induce
them
to
take
part
in
the
negotiation
so
that
the
return
to
france
might
be
rendered
possible
sir
sidney
manifested
a
disposition
to
enter
into
arrangements
acting
as
plenipotentiary
of
his
britannic
majesty
and
attributing
to
himself
a
power
which
he
had
ceased
to
hold
since
the
arrival
of
lord
elgin
as
ambassador
at
constantinople
poussielgue
was
an
advocate
for
evacuation
desaix
just
the
reverse
the
conditions
proposed
by
kléber
were
unreasonable
not
that
they
were
an
exorbitant
equivalent
for
what
was
given
up
in
giving
up
egypt
but
because
they
were
not
feasible
sir
sidney
made
kléber
sensible
of
this
officers
treating
for
a
mere
suspension
of
arms
could
not
include
topics
of
vast
extent
in
their
negotiation
such
as
the
demand
for
the
possession
of
the
venetian
islands
and
the
annulment
of
the
triple
alliance
but
it
was
urgently
necessary
to
settle

the

of

secondly
a

soon

had
actually
arrived
before
the
fort
of
el
arish
the
first
french
post
on
the
frontiers
of

and
had
summoned
it
to
surrender
the

in
fact
had
been
going
on
for
a
fortnight
on
board
while
floating
at
the
pleasure
of
the
winds
off
the
coasts
of
syria
and
egypt
the
parties
had
said
all
they
had
to
say
and
the
negotiations
could
not
be
continued
to
any
useful
purpose
without
the
concurrence
of
the
grand
vizier
sir
sidney
availing
himself
of
a
favourable
moment
pushed
off
in
a
boat
which
landed
him
on
the
coast
after
incurring
some
danger
and
ordered
the
captain
of
to
meet
him
in
the
port
of
jaffa
where
poussielgue
and
desaix
were
to
be
put
ashore
if
the
conferences
were
to
be
transferred
to
the
camp
of
the
grand
vizier
at
the
moment
when
the
english
commodore
reached
the
camp
a
horrible
event
had
occurred
at
el
arish
the
grand
vizier
had
collected
around
him
an
army
of
seventy
or
eighty
thousand
fanatic
mussulmans
the
turks
were
joined
by
the
mamluks
ibrahim
bey
who
had
some
time
before
retired
to
syria
and
murad
bey
who
had
descended
by
a
long
circuit
from
the
cataracts
to
the
environs
of
suez
had
become
the
auxiliaries
of
their
former
adversaries
the
english
had
made
for
this
army
a
sort
of
drawn
by
mules
the
fort
of
el
arish
before
which
the
turks
were
at
this
moment
was
according
to
the
declaration
of
general
bonaparte
one
of
the
two
keys
of
egypt
alexandria
was
the

the
turkish
having
reached
el
arish
colonel
douglas
an
english
officer
in
the
service
of
turkey
summoned
cazals
the
commandant
to
surrender
the
culpable
sentiments
which
the
officers
had
too
much
encouraged
in
the
army
then
burst
forth
the
soldiers
in
the
garrison
at
el
arish
vehemently
longing
like
their
comrades
to
leave
egypt
declared
to
the
commandant
that
they
would
not
fight
and
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
surrender
the
fort
illustration
a
modern
fanatic
the
gallant
cazals
indignantly
refused
and
a
struggle
with
the
turks
ensued
during
this
contest
the
recreants
who
insisted
on
surrendering
threw
ropes
to
the
turks
these
ferocious
enemies
once
hoisted
up
into
the
fort
rushed
sword
in
hand
upon
those
who
had
given
them
admission
into
the
fort

slaughtered
a
great
number
of
them
the

brought
back
to

defending
themselves
with

to

humane
and
distinguished

was
now
the
of
december
the
letter
written
by
sir
sidney
smith
to
the
grand
vizier
to
propose
to
him
a
suspension
of
arms
had
not
reached
him
in
time
to
prevent
the
melancholy
catastrophe
at
el
arish
sir
sidney
smith
was
a
man
of
generous
feelings
this
barbarous
massacre
of
a
french
garrison
horrified
him
and
above
all
it
made
him
fearful
of
the
rupture
of
the
negotiations
he
lost
no
time
in
sending
explanations
to
kléber
both
in
his
own
name
and
that
of
the
grand
vizier
and
he
added
the
formal
assurance
that
all
hostility
should
cease
during
the
negotiations
kléber
when
informed
of
the
massacre
of
el
arish
did
not
manifest
as
much
indignation
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
was
aware
that
if
he
was
too
warm
upon
that
subject
all
the
negotiations
might
be
broken
off
he
was
more
urgent
than
ever
for
a
suspension
of
arms
and
at
the
same
time
by
way
of
precaution
and
to
be
nearer
to
the
theatre
of
the
conferences
he
left
cairo
and
transferred
his
headquarters
to
salahieh
on
the
very
border
of
the
desert
two
march
from
el
arish
in
the
meantime
desaix

able
to
land
at
gaza
till
the

to
reach
el
arish
before
the
the
evacuation
and
its
conditions
soon
became
the
sole
subject
of
negotiation
after
long
discussions
it
was
agreed
that
all
hostility
should
cease
for
three
months
that
those
three
months
should
be
employed
by
the
vizier
in
collecting
in
the
ports
of
rosetta
abukir
and
alexandria
the
vessels
requisite
for
the
conveyance
of
the
french
army
by
general
kléber
in
evacuating
the
upper
nile
cairo
and
the
contiguous
provinces
and
in
concentrating
his
troops
about
the
point
of
embarkation
that
the
french
should
depart
with
the
honours
of
war
that
they
should
cease
to
impose
contributions
but
that
in
return
the
french
army
should
receive
three
thousand
purses
equivalent
at
that
time
to
three
million
francs
and
representing
the
sum
necessary
for
its
subsistence
during
the

and
the
passage

of
katieh
salahieh

the
belbeys

of

to
be
given
up
ten
days
after
the
ratification

forty
days
after
the
terms
of
the
convention
being
arranged
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
sign
it
kléber
who
had
a
vague
feeling
of
his
fault
determined
in
order
to
cover
it
to
assemble
a
council
of
war
to
which
all
the
generals
of
the
army
were
summoned
the
council
met
on
the
of

the
minutes
of
it
still

desaix
although
deeply
grieved
was
swept
along
by
the
torrent
of
popular
opinion
gave
way
to
it
himself
and
affixed
his
signature
on
the
of
january
to
the
convention
of
el
arish
meanwhile
preparations
were
being
made
for
departure
sir
sidney
smith
had
returned
to
his
ship
the
vizier
advanced
and
took
possession
consecutively
of
the
entrenched
positions
of
katieh
salahieh
and
belbeys
which
kléber
in
haste
to
execute
the
convention
faithfully
delivered
up
to
him
kléber
returned
to
cairo
to
make
his
preparations
for
departure
to
call
in
the
troops
that
were
guarding
upper
egypt
to
concentrate
his
army
and
then
to
direct
it
upon
alexandria
and
rosetta
at
the
time
stipulated
for
embarkation
while
these
events
were
occurring
in
egypt
the
english
cabinet
had
received
advice
of
the
overtures
made
by
general
kléber
to
the
grand
vizier
and
to
sir
sidney
smith
believing
that
the
french
army
was
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
it
lost
no
time
in
sending
off
an
express
order
not
to
grant
any
capitulation
unless
they
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
of
war
these
orders
despatched
from
london
on
the
of
december
reached
admiral
keith
in
the
island
of
minorca
in
the
first
days
of
january
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
admiral
hastened
to
forward
to
sir
sidney
smith
the
instructions
which
he
had
just
received
from
the
government
he
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
kléber
to
express
his
mortification
to
apprise
him
honestly
of
what
was
passing
to
advise
him
to
suspend
immediately
the
delivery
of
the
egyptian
fortresses
to
the
grand
vizier
and
to
conjure
him
to
wait
for
fresh
orders
from
england
before
he
took
any
definite
resolutions
unfortunately
when
these
advices
from
sir
sidney
arrived
at
cairo
the
french
army
had
already
executed
in
part
the
treaty
of
el
arish
kléber
instantly
countermanded
all
the
orders
previously
given
to
the
army
he
brought
back
from
lower
egypt
to
cairo
part
of
the
troops
that
had
already
descended
the
nile
he
ordered
his
stores
to
be
sent
up
again
he
urged
the
division
of
upper
egypt
to
make
haste
to
rejoin
him
and
gave
notice
to
the
grand
vizier
to
suspend
his
march
towards
cairo
otherwise
he
should
immediately
commence
hostilities
the
grand
vizier
replied
that
the
convention
of
el
arish
was
signed
that
it
must
be
executed
that
in
consequence
he
should
advance
towards
the
capital
at
the
same
instant
an
officer
sent
from
minorca
with
a
letter
from
lord
keith
to
kléber
arrived
at
the
headquarters
kléber
fired
with
indignation
at
the
demand
for
surrender
caused
lord
letter
to
be
inserted
in
the
order
of
the
day
adding
to
it
these
few
words
to
such
insults
there
is
no
other
answer
than
victory
prepare
for
agents
from
sir
sidney
had
hastened
up
to
interpose
between
the
french
and
the
turks
and
to
make
fresh
proposals
of
accommodation
letters
they
said
had
just
been
written
to
london
and
when
the
convention
of
el
arish
was
known
there
it
would
be
ratified
to
a
certainty
in
this
situation
it
would
not
be
right
to
suspend
hostilities
and
wait
to
this
the
grand
vizier
and
kléber
consented
but
on
conditions
that
were
irreconcilable
the
grand
vizier
insisted
that
cairo
should
be
given
up
to
him
kléber
on
the
contrary
that
the
vizier
should
fall
back
to
the
frontier
under
these
conditions
fighting
was
the
only
resource
on
the
of
march
in
the
plain
of
heliopolis
ten
thousand
soldiers
by
superiority
in
discipline
and
courage
dispersed
seventy
or
eighty
thousand
foes
kléber
gave
orders
for
the
pursuit
on
the
following
day
when
he
had
ascertained
with
his
own
eyes
that
the
turkish
army
had
disappeared
he
resolved
to
return
and
reduce
the
towns
of
lower
egypt
and
cairo
in
particular
to
their
duty
he
arrived
at
cairo
on
the
of
march
important
events
had
occurred
there
since
his
departure
the
population
of
that
great
city
which
numbered
nearly
three
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
fickle
inflammable
inclined
to
change
had
followed
the
suggestions
of
turkish
emissaries
and
fallen
upon
the
french
the
moment
they
heard
the
cannon
at
heliopolis
pouring
forth
outside
the
walls
during
the
battle
and
seeing
and
ibrahim
bey
with
some
thousand
horse
and
janizaries
they
supposed
them
to
be
the
conquerors
taking
good
care
not
to
undeceive
the
inhabitants
the
turks
affirmed
that
the
grand
vizier
had
gained
a
complete
victory
and
that
the
french
were
exterminated
at
these
tidings
fifty
thousand
men
had
risen
in
cairo
at
bulak
and
at
gizeh
and
cairo
became
a
scene
of
plunder
rapine
and
murder
illustration
citadel
of
cairo
during
these
transactions
general
friant
arrived
detached
from
belbeys
and
lastly
kléber
himself
though
conqueror
of
the
grand
army
kléber
had
a
serious
difficulty
to
surmount
to
subdue
an
immense
city
peopled
by
three
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
partly
in
a
state
of
revolt
occupied
by
twenty
thousand
turks
and
built
in
the
oriental
style
that
is
to
say
having
narrow
streets
divided
into
piles
of
masonry
which
were
real
fortresses
these
edifices
receiving
light
from
within
and
exhibiting
without
nothing
but
lofty
walls
had
terraces
instead
of
roofs
from
which
the
insurgents
poured
a
downward
and
destructive
fire
add
to
this
that
the
turks
were
masters
of
the
whole
city
excepting
the
citadel
and
the
square
of
ezbekieh
which
in
a
manner
they
had
blockaded
by
closing
the
streets
that
ran
into
it
with
embattled
walls
in
this
situation
kléber
showed
as
much
prudence
as
he
had
just
shown
energy
in
the
field
he
resolved
to
gain
time
and
to
let
the
insurrection
wear
itself
out
the
insurgents
could
not
fail
at
length
to
be
undeceived
respecting
the
general
state
of
things
in
egypt
and
to
learn
that
the
french
were
everywhere
victorious
and
the
army
dispersed
turks
ibrahim
mamluks
and
the
arab
population
of
cairo
could
not
agree
together
long
for
all
these
reasons
kléber
thought
it
advisable
to
temporise
and
to
negotiate
while
he
was
gaining
time
he
completed
his
treaty
of
alliance
with
murad
bey
he
granted
to
him
the
province
of
under
the
supremacy
of
france
on
condition
of
paying
a
tribute
equivalent
to
a
considerable
part
of
the
imposts
of
that
province
murad
bey
engaged
moreover
to
fight
for
the
french
and
the
french
engaged
if
they
should
ever
quit
the
country
to
facilitate
for
him
the
occupation
of
egypt
murad
bey
faithfully
adhered
to
the
treaty
which
he
had
just
signed
and
began
by
driving
from
upper
egypt
a
turkish
corps
which
had
occupied
it
the
insurgents
of
cairo
obstinately
refused
to
capitulate
and
an
attack
by
main
force
was
therefore
indispensable
for
completing
the
reduction
of
the
city
during
which
several
thousand
turks
mamluks
and
insurgents
were
killed
and
four
thousand
houses
were
destroyed
by
fire
thus
terminated
that
sanguinary
struggle
which
had
commenced
with
the
battle
of
heliopolis
on
the
of
march
and
which
ended
on
the
of
april
with
the
departure
of
the
last
lieutenants
of
the
vizier
after
fighting
between
twenty
thousand
french
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
whole
force
of
the
ottoman
empire
seconded
by
the
revolt
of
the
egyptian
towns
in
the
delta
all
the
towns
had
returned
to
a
state
of
complete
submission
murad
bey
had
driven
from
upper
egypt
the
turkish
detachment
of
dervish
pasha
the
vanquished
everywhere
trembled
before
the
conqueror
and
expected
a
terrible
chastisement
kléber
who
was
humane
and
wise
took
good
care
not
to
repay
cruelties
with
cruelties
the
egyptians
were
persuaded
that
they
should
be
treated
harshly
they
conceived
that
the
loss
of
life
and
property
would
atone
for
the
crime
of
those
who
had
risen
in
revolt
kléber
called
them
together
assumed
at
first
a
stern
look
but
afterwards
pardoned
them
merely
imposing
a
contribution
on
the
insurgent
villages
cairo
paid
ten
million
francs
a
burden
far
from
onerous
for
so
large
a
city
and
the
inhabitants
considered
themselves
as
most
fortunate
to
get
off
so
easily
eight
millions
more
were
imposed
upon
the
rebel
towns
of
lower
egypt
the
army
proud
of
its
victories
confident
in
its
strength
knowing
that
general
bonaparte
was
at
the
head
of
the
government
ceased
to
doubt
that
it
would
soon
receive
reinforcements
kléber
had
in
the
plain
of
heliopolis
made
the
noblest
amends
for
his
momentary
faults
he
entered
upon
a
second
conquest
showing
clemency
and
humanity
on
all
sides
and
everywhere
he
laboured
hard
to
encourage
the
arts
and
industries
and
agriculture
he
assembled
the
administrators
of
the
army
the
persons
best
acquainted
with
the
country
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
organisation
of
the
finances
of
the
colony
he
restored
the
collection
of
the
direct
contributions
to
the
kopts
to
whom
it
had
formerly
been
entrusted
and
imposed
some
new
duties
and
taxes
on
articles
of
consumption
he
gave
orders
for
the
completion
of
the
forts
constructing
around
cairo
and
set
men
to
work
at
those
of
lesbeh
damietta
burlos
and
rosetta
situated
on

pressed
forward
the
works
of
alexandria
and
imparted
fresh
activity
to
the
scientific
researches
of
the
institute
of
egypt
and
a
valuable
mass
of
information
was
embodied
in
the
great
french
work
the
de
from
the
cataracts
to
the
mouths
of
the
nile
everything
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
solid
and
durable
establishment
two
months
afterwards
the
caravans
of
syria
arabia
and
darfur
began
to
appear
again
at
cairo
but
a
deplorable
event
snatched
away
general
kléber
in
the
midst
of
his
exploits
and
of
his
judicious
government
he
was
assassinated
in
the
garden
of
his
palace
by
a
young
man
a
native
of
aleppo
named
suleiman
who
was
a
prey
to
extravagant
fanaticism
with
death
egypt
was
lost
for

menou
who
succeeded
him
was
very
far
beneath
such
a
task
the
english
offered
to
make
good
the
convention
of
el
arish
but
menou
refused
and
england
prepared
for
an
invasion
after
attempting
vainly
to

the
turks
sir
ralph
abercrombie
who
had
been
appointed
as
british
commissioner
landed
with
the
english
army
alone
at
abukir
after
fierce
skirmishing
the
french
and
english
met
on
the
plains
of
alexandria
in
the
frightful
conflict
which
ensued
sir
ralph
abercrombie
was
slain
but
the
battle
ended
with
the
retreat
of
the
french
damietta
surrendered
on

the
french
were
now
divided
while

he

movements

he

of

if
we
consider
the
events
of
his
life
and
the
diverse
roads
by
which
he
reached
the
apogee
of
his
fortunes
reviewing
the
scenes
now
sombre
now
magnificent
of
that
remarkable
fate
we
obtain
a
complete
picture
of
egypt
itself
seen
from
the
most
intimate
real
and
striking
point
of
view
according
to
the
most
authentic
accounts
mehemet
ali
was
born
in
at
cavala
a
seaport
in
turkey
in
europe
he
was
yet
very
young
when
he
lost
his
father
ibrahim
agha
and
soon
after
this
misfortune
his
uncle
and
sole
remaining
relative
was
beheaded
by
order
of
the
porte
left
an
orphan
mehemet
ali
was
adopted
by
the
tchorbadji
of
praousta
an
old
friend
of
his
father
who
brought
him
up
with
his
own
son
the
boy
spent
his
early
youth
in
the
discharge
of
unimportant
military
duties
where
however
he
frequently
found
opportunity
to
display
his
intelligence
and
courage
he
was
even
able
to
render
many
services
to
his
protector
in
the
collecting
of
taxes
which
was
always
a
difficult
matter
in
turkey
and
occasionally
necessitated
a
regular
military
expedition
anxious
to
reward
mehemet
for
all
his
services
and
also
doubtless
desirous
of
a
still
closer
connection
the
aged
tchorbadji
married
him
to
his
daughter
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
young
success
he
was
then
eighteen
years
old
dealings
with
a
french
merchant
of
cavala
had
inspired
him
with
a
taste
for
commerce
and
devoting
himself
to
it
he
speculated
with
much
success
chiefly
in
tobacco
the
richest
product
of
his
country
this
period
of
his
life
was
not
without
its
influence
upon
egypt
for
we
know
how
strenuously
the
pasha
endeavoured
to
develop
the
commercial
and
manufacturing
industries
the
french
invasion
surprised
him
in
the
midst
of
these
peaceful
occupations
the
porte
having
raised
an
army
in
macedonia
ordered
the
tchorbadji
to
furnish
a
contingent
of
three
hundred
men
who
entrusted
the
command
of
this
small
force
to
his
son
ali
agha
appointing
mehemet
ali
whose
merit
and
courage
he
fully
appreciated
as
his
lieutenant
the
macedonain
recruits
rejoined
the
forces
of
the
and
landed
with
the
grand
vizier
at
abukir
where
was
fought
that
battle
which
resulted
in
victory
for
france
and
the
complete
defeat
of
the
army
completely
demoralised
by
this
overthrow
ali
agha
left
mehemet
ali
in
command
of
his
troops
and
quitted
the
army
it
is
well
to
consider
in
a
brief
survey
the
state
of
the
country
at
the
moment
when
the
incapacity
of
general
menou
compelled
the
french
to
withdraw
from
egypt
arrayed
against
each
other
were
the
troops
of
the
sultan
numbering
four
thousand
albanians
and
those
forces
sent
from
england
under
the
command
of
admiral
keith
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
were
the
mamluks
striving
for
supremacy
and
it
was
a
question
whether
this
powerful
force
would
once
more
rule
egypt
as
before
the
french
invasion
or
whether
the
country
would
again
fall
under
the
dominion
of
the
porte
there
was
occasion
for
anxiety
among
the
mamluks
themselves
their
two
principal
beys
and
muhammed
instead
of
strengthening
their
forces
by
acting
in
concert
as
murad
bey
and
ibrahim
bey
had
done
before
the
french
occupation
permitted
their
rivalry
for
power
so
completely
to
absorb
them
that
it
was
finally
the
means
of
encompassing
their
ruin
and
that
of
their
party
the
first
pasha
invested
with
the
viceroyalty
of
egypt
after
the
departure
of
the
french
troops
was
muhammed
khusurf
who
faithfully
served
the
porte
his
government
was
able
and
zealous
but
the
measures
he
employed
against
his
haughty
antagonists
lacked
the
lofty
intelligence
indispensable
to
so
difficult
a
task
muhammed
khusurf
whose
rivalry
with
mehemet
ali
had
for
some
years
attracted
european
attention
found
himself
at
last
face
to
face
with
his
future
opponent
mehemet
ali
by
dint
of
hard
work
and
the
many
important
services
rendered
to
his
country
had
passed
through
successive
stages
of
promotion
to
the
rank
of
serchime
which
gave
him
the
command
of
three
or
four
thousand
albanians
foreseeing
his
opportunity
he
had
employed
himself
in
secretly
strengthening
his
influence
over
his
subordinates
he
allied
himself
with
the
opened
the
gates
of
cairo
to
them
and
joining
marched
against
khusurf
he
pursued
the
viceroy
to
damietta
taking
possession
of
the
town
conducted
his
prisoner
to
cairo
where
he
placed
him
in
the
custody
of
the
aged
ibrahim
bey
the
nestor
of
the
mamluks
at
this
moment
the
second
mamluk
bey
muhammed
returned
from
england
whither
he
had
accompanied
the
british
to
demand
protection
when
they
evacuated
alexandria
in
march
of
the
same
year
and
landed
at
abukir
this
arrival
filled
bardisi
with
the
gravest
anxiety
for
muhammed
was
his
equal
in
station
and
would
share
his
power
even
if
he
did
not
deprive
him
of
the
position
he
had
recently
acquired
through
his
own
efforts
these
fears
were
but
too
well
founded
whilst
bardisi
was
securing
his
position
by
warfare
had
gained
the
protection
of
england
and
as
its
price
had
pledged
himself
to
much
that
would
compromise
the
future
of
egypt
far
from
openly
joining
one
or
other
of
the
rival
parties
mehemet
ali
contented
himself
with
fanning
the
flame
of
their
rivalry
the
rank
of
albanian
captain
which
gave
him
the
air
of
a
subaltern
greatly
facilitated
the
part
he
intended
to
play
he
worked
quietly
and
with
unending
perseverance
flattering
the
ambitions
of
some
feeding
the
resentment
of
others
winning
the
with
soft
words
overcoming
the
strong

his
own
strength
presiding
over
all
the
revolutions
in
cairo
upholding
the
cause
of
the
pashas
when
the
mamluks
needed
support
and
when
the
pasha
had
acquired
a
certain
amount
of
power
uniting
himself
with
the
mamluk
against
his
allies
of
yesterday
above
all
neglecting
nothing
which
could
secure
him
the
support
of
the
people
and
making
use
for
this
end
of
the
sheikhs
and
oulemas
whom
he
conciliated
some
by
religious
appearances
others
by
his
apparent
desire
for
the
public
good
he
thus
maintained
his
position
during
the
numerous
changes
brought
about
by
the
respective
parties
at
length
in
the
beginning
of
march
as
the
people
were
beginning
to
weary
of
disturbances
as
violent
as
they
were
frequent
mehemet
ali
promised
the
sheikhs
to
restore
peace
and
order
if
they
would
assure
him
their
and
influence
he
then
incited
a
revolt
against
the
oulemas
besieged
kourshyd
pasha
in
the
citadel
made
himself
master
of
cairo
in
the
space
of
a
few
days
and
finished
his
work
by
expelling
the
mamluks
the
albanians
and
oulemas
completely
carried
away
by
his
valour
and
manouvres
proclaimed
him
pasha
immediately
always
prudent
and
anxious
to
establish
his
claims
upon
the
favour
of
the
porte
mehemet
ali
feigned
to
refuse
after
considerable
hesitation
which
gave
way
before
some
costly
gifts
or
possibly
on
consideration
of
the
difficulties
hitherto
experienced
in
establishing
the
authority
of
the
pashas
the
turkish
government
determined
to
confirm
the
choice
of
the
egyptian
people
mehemet
ali
received
therefore
the
firman
of
investiture
on
july
but
during
the
ensuing
seven
months
he
governed
in
lower
egypt
only
alexandria
still
being
under
the
authority
of
an
officer
delegated
by
the
sultan
as
for
upper
egypt
it
had
remained
the
appanage
of
the
mamluk
beys
who
had
contrived
to
retain
possession
of
the
saïd
mehemet
ali
had
no
sooner
been
proclaimed
than
elfi
who
had
reorganised
his
party
in
upper
egypt
did
all
in
his
power
to
overthrow
the
new
pasha
he
first
offered
to
assist
kourshyd
to
regain
his
former
position
he
promised
his
allegiance
to
the
porte
on
condition
of
the
dismissal
of
mehemet
ali
and
then
turned
his
attention
to
england
he
found
difficulty
in
obtaining
her
concurrence
by
promising
to
give
up
the
chief
ports
of
egypt
these
negotiations
suspended
the
first
time
by
the
french
consul
at
alexandria
with
the
pasha
were
again
renewed
some
time
after
through
the
influence
of
the
english
ambassador
who
in
the
name
of
his
country
demanded
the
of
the
mamluks
guaranteeing
the
fidelity
of
elfi
the
porte
at
once
sent
a
fleet
to
egypt
bearing
a
firman
appointing
mehemet
ali
to
the
pashalic
of
salonica
at
this
juncture
the
viceroy
feeling
sure
of
the
support
of
the
sheikhs
who
had
assisted
him
to
his
present
position
only
sought
to
temporise
he
soon
received
the
further
support
of
the
mamluk
beys
of
party
who
forgot
their
personal
grievances
in
the
desire
to
be
revenged
upon
the
common
foe
at
the
same
time
french
mamluks
urged
thereto
by
drovetti
deserted
the
ranks
of
adherents
and
joined
mehemet
ali
the
pasha
of
egypt
possessed
a
zealous
partisan
in
the
french
ambassador
at
constantinople
the
latter
perceiving
that
the
secession
of
the
mamluks
made
the
regaining
of
their
former
power
an
absolute
impossibility
pleaded
the
cause
of
mehemet
ali
with
the
porte
and
obtained
a
firman
his
viceroyalty
on
condition
of
his
payment
of
an
annual
tribute
of
about
the
power
of
mehemet
ali
was
beginning
to
be
more
firmly
established
and
the
almost
simultaneous
deaths
of
and
muhammed
november
and
january
seemed
to
promise
a
peaceful
future
when
on
march
the
english
displeased
at
his
reconciliation
with
the
porte
arrived
in
egypt
their
forces
numbered
some
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
and
it
was
the
intention
to
stir
up
the
mamluks
and
render
them
every
assistance
a
detachment
of
the
english
forces
led
by
general
fraser
took
possession
of
alexandria
which
the
english
occupied
for
six
months
without
being
able
to
attempt
any
other
enterprise
the
remainder
of
the
troops
were
cut
to
pieces
at
rosetta
by
a
small
contingent
of
albanians
thus
ended
the
expedition
the
viceroy
who
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
had
displayed
really
oriental
cruelty
and
sent
more
than
a
thousand
heads
of
english
soldiers
to
cairo
to
decorate
rumlieh
finished
his
operations
by
an
act
of
european
generosity
and
delivered
up
his
prisoners
without
demanding
ransom
the
plan
of
defence
adopted
by
the
pasha
was
the
work
of
drovetti
to
whom
consequently
is
due
some
of
the
glory
of
this
rapid
triumph
mehemet
ali
having
nothing
further
to
fear
from
the
english
who
evacuated
egypt
in
september
began
to
give
scope
to
his
ambitious
schemes
when
the
easily
disturbed
policy
of
the
porte
saw
fit
to
send
the
wily
pasha
against
the
wahabis
who
threatened
to
invade
the
holy
places
before
obeying
these
injunctions
the
viceroy
deemed
it
wise
previous
to
engaging
in
a
campaign
so
perilous
to
ensure
egypt
against
the
dangers
with
which
in
the
absence
of
the
forces
she
would
be
menaced
illustration
mosque
of
mehemit

but
egypt
had
no
more
powerful
enemies
than
the
mamluks
who
since
had
kept
the
country
in
a
constant
state
of
agitation
mehemet
ali
therefore
determined
to
put
an
end
to
this
civil
war
root
and
branch
and
to
exterminate
completely
this
formidable
adversary
he
did
not
hesitate
in
the
choice
of
means
war
would
not
have
succeeded
murder
therefore
was
the
only
alternative
and
the
viceroy
adopted
this
horrible
means
of
accomplishing
his
designs
he
invited
the
entire
corps
to
a
banquet
which
he
proposed
to
give
in
the
citadel
palace
in
honour
of
the
departure
of
tussun
pasha
for
mecca
this
palace
is
built
upon
a
rock
and
is
reached
by
perpendicular
paths
on
may
the
day
fixed
upon
for
the
festivity
mehemet
ali
received
his
guests
in
great
splendour
and
with
a
cordiality
calculated
to
dispel
any
suspicions
the
mamluks
might
have
entertained
at
the
conclusion
of
the
banquet
as
they
were
returning
home
they
were
fired
upon
in
the
narrow
pass
where
retreat
and
resistance
were
perfectly
impossible
thus
after
having
defeated
the
bravest
troops
in
the
world
they
died
obscurely
ingloriously
and
unable
to
defend
themselves
hassan
bey
brother
of
the
celebrated
elfi
spurred
his
horse
to
a
gallop
rode
over
the
parapets
and
fell
bruised
and
bleeding
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
where
some
arabs
saved
him
from
certain
death
by
aiding
his
flight
the
few
who
escaped
massacre
took
refuge
in
syria
or
dongola
whilst
this
horrible
drama
was
being
enacted
in
cairo
similar
scenes
were
taking
place
in
those
provinces
whose
governors
had
received
stringent
commands
to
butcher
every
remaining
mamluk
in
egypt
thus
nearly
all
perished
and
that
famous
corps
was
destroyed
for
ever
although
mehemet
ali
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
intentions
which
had
prompted
the
porte
to
organise
the
expedition
against
the
wahabis
he
hastened
to
prepare
for
this
lengthy
war
mehemet
himself
was
in
command
of
an
army
in
the
hedjaz
when
latif
pasha
arrived
bearing
a
firman
of
investiture
to
the
pashalic
of
egypt
luckily
mehemet
ali
on
his
departure
had
left
behind
him
as
vekyl
a
trustworthy
man
devoted
to
his
interests
namely
mehemet
bey
this
faithful
minister
pretended
to
favour
the
claims
of
latif
pasha
and
then
arrested
him
and
had
him
publicly
executed
from
this
moment
the
real
reign
of
mehemet
ali
begins
possessed
of
a
fertile
country
he
promptly
began
to
consider
the
ways
and
means
of
improving
the
deplorable
state
of
its
finances
and
to
grasp
all
the
resources
which
agriculture
and
commerce
could
yield
for
the
realisation
of
his
ambitious
schemes
nothing
must
be
neglected
in
the
government
of
a
country
for
so
many
years
the
scene
of
incessant
warfare
the
labourer
must
be
made
to
return
to
the
field
he
had
deserted
during
the
time
of
trouble
political
and
civil
order
must
be
reestablished
so
as
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
and
secure
the
resumption
of
long
abandoned
industries
the
most
important
matter
was
to
restrain
the
depredations
of
the
bedouins
and
to
assure
the
obedience
of
these
hitherto
unsubdued
tribes
he
kept
their
sheikhs
as
hostages
at
the
same
time
he
checked
the
delinquencies
of
the
kopts
in
whose
hands
the
government
of
the
territories
had
been
from
time
immemorial
a
sure
and
certain
peace
thus
having
been
ensured
to
the
interior
of
the
country
the
pasha
turned
his
attention
to
another
enterprise
the
accomplishment
of
which
is
always
somewhat
difficult
after
a
lengthy
crisis
he
wished
to
encourage
and
regulate
the
payment
of
taxes
without
hindering
the
financial
operations
of
private
individuals
to
this
end
he
the
custom
of
receiving
tribute
in
kind
and
to
support
the
payment
of
this
tribute
he
organised
the
export
trade
a
thousand
vessels
built
at
his
own
expense
ploughed
the
waters
of
the
nile
in
all
directions
and
conveyed
egyptian
produce
to
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
where
huge
warehouses
stored
the
goods
destined
for
foreign
countries
mehemet
ali
preserved
a
continual
intercourse
with
foreign
merchants
and
the
country
owed
many
fortunate
innovations
to
these
relations
agriculture
was
enriched
by
several
productions
hitherto
unknown
a
frenchman
jumel
introduced
improvements
in
the
production
of
cotton
whilst
drovetti
the
tried
friend
helped
to
further
the
establishment
of
manufactories
by
his
advice
and
great
experience
of
men
and

despatched
as
much
as
seven
million
of
cereals
every
year
and
more
than
six
hundred
thousand
bales
of
cotton
in
return
european
gold
flowed
into
the
treasury
of
this
industrious
pasha
and
the
revenues
of
egypt
which
hitherto
had
never
exceeded
were
more
than
doubled
in
the
very
slight
success
which
mehemet
ali
had
obtained
when
commanding
the
irregular
forces
during
the
expedition
against
the
wahabis
decided
him
to
put
a
idea
into
execution
namely
to
organise
an
army
on
european
lines
henceforth
this
became
the
sole
occupation
of
the
enterprising
pasha
and
the
exclusive
goal
of
his
perseverance
the
was
proclaimed
in
the
month
of
july
and
all
the
troops
were
ordered
to
model
themselves
after
the
pattern
of
the
french
army
this
large
undertaking
which
in
had
cost
selim
iii
his
life
proved
almost
as
fatal
to
mehemet
ali
a
terrible
insurrection
broke
out
amongst
the
alien
soldiers
who
principally
composed
the
army
the
infuriated
troops
rose
against
the
tyrant
and
the
unbeliever
the
palace
was
pillaged
and
the
pasha
had
scarcely
time
to
seek
the
shelter
of
his
citadel
his
only
means
of
saving
his
life
and
recovering
his
authority
was
solemnly
to
promise
to
abandon
his
plan
mehemet
ali
therefore
deferred
his
military
schemes
and
awaited
the
opportunity
to
test
its
success
upon
the
natives
who
would
be
far
more
easily
managed
than
the
excitable
strangers
brought
up
as
they
were
on
the
old
traditions
of
the
okaz
and
the
mamluks
the
war
which
still
raged
in
arabia
gave
him
the
means
of
ridding
himself
of
the
most
indomitable
men
whom
he
despatched
to
hedjaz
under
the
command
of
ibrahim
pasha
his
eldest
son
now
came
success
to
console
mehemet
ali
for
the
failure
of
his
reformatory
plans
after
a
long
series
of
disasters
ibrahim
succeeded
in
the
year
in
taking
abd
allah
the
chief
of
the
wahabis
prisoner
he
sent
him
to
the
great
pasha
a
name
often
applied
to
mehemet
ali
in
egypt
at
cairo
bearing
a
portion
of
the
jewels
taken
from
the
temple
at
mecca
the
unfortunate
man
was
then
taken
to
constantinople
where
his
punishment
bore
testimony
to
the
victory
rather
than
the
clemency
of
his
conquerors
in
reward
for
his
services
the
sultan
sent
ibrahim
a
mantle
of
honour
and
named
him
pasha
of
egypt
which
title
conferred
on
him
the
highest
rank
among
the
viziers
and
pashas
and
even
placed
him
above
his
own
father
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
turkish
empire
at
the
same
time
mehemet
ali
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
khan
an
attribute
of
the
ottomans
and
the
greatest
distinction
obtainable
for
a
pasha
inasmuch
as
it
was
formerly
exclusively
reserved
for
the
sovereigns
of
the
crimea
illustration
the
cotton
plant
after
destroying
daryeh
the
capital
of
nedj
mehemet
ali
conceived
the
idea
of
extending
his
possessions
in
the
interior
of
africa
and
of
subduing
the
country
of
the
negroes
where
he
hoped
to
find
much
treasure
he
accordingly
sent
his
son
ishmail
pasha
with
five
thousand
men
upon
this
expedition
which
ended
most
disastrously
with
the
murder
of
ishmail
and
his
guard
by
melek
nemr
and
the
destruction
of
the
remainder
of
his
forces

year

the
impossibility
of
putting
down

greek

his
pride
sufficiently
to
ask

of

mehemet
was
now
in
possession
of
a
army
and
a
fleet
which
were
placed
at
the
service
of
the
sultan
who
promised
him
in
return
the
sovereignty
of
crete
the
pashalic
of
syria
and
possibly
the
reversion
of
morea
for
his
son
ibrahim
the
greeks
deceived
by
their
easy
successes
over
the
undisciplined
turkish
hosts
failed
to
realise
the
greatness
of
the
danger
which
threatened
them
the
egyptian
fleet
managed
without
serious
opposition
to
enter
the
archipelago
and
in
december
ibrahim
to
whom
mehemet
ali
had
entrusted
the
supreme
command
of
the
expedition
established
his
base
in
crete
within
striking
distance
of
the
greek
mainland
the
following
february
he
landed
with
four
thousand
regular
infantry
and
five
hundred
cavalry
at
modon
in
the
south
of
morea
the
greeks
were
utterly
unable
to
hold
their
own
against
the
fellaheen
of
ibrahim
bey
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
whole
of
the
peloponnesus
with
the
exception
of
a
few
strongholds
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
invader
and
the
report
was
spread
that
ibrahim
intended
to
deport
the
greek
population
and
the
country
with
moslem
negroes
and
arabs
the
only
barrier
opposed
to
the
entire
extinction
of
the
greek
population
was
their
single
stronghold
of
missolonghi
which
was
now
besieged
by
rashid
pasha
and
the
turks
if
ibrahim
had
joined
his
forces
with
the
besieging
army
of
the
turks
missolonghi
could
hardly
have
resisted
their
combined
attack
and
the
greek
race
would
have
been
in
danger
of
suffering
annihilation
meanwhile
the
great
powers
of
europe
were
seriously
concerned
with
this
threatened
destruction
of
the
greeks
england
proposed
a
joint
intervention
in
defence
of
greece
on
the
part
of
the
powers
but
russia
desired
to
act
alone
a
huge
army
was
gradually
concentrated
upon
the
turkish
frontier
the
greek
leaders
now
offered
to
place
greece
under
british
protection
and
the
duke
of
wellington
was
sent
to
petersburg
to
arrange
the
terms
of
the
proposed
joint
intervention
a
protocol
was
signed
at
petersburg
april
whereby
england
and
russia
pledged
themselves
to
cooperate
in
preventing
any
further
agression
a
more
definite
agreement
was
reached
in
september
aiming
at
the
cutting
off
of
ibrahim
in
morea
by
a
united
european
fleet
thus
forcing
the
turks
and
egyptians
to
terms
on
july
a
treaty
was
signed
at
london
between
england
france
and
russia
which
empowered
the
french
and
english
admirals
at
smyrna
to
part
the
combatants
by
peaceful
means
if
possible
and
if
not
by
force
admiral
codrington
at
once
sailed
to
nauplia
the
greeks
were
willing
to
accept
an
armistice
but
the
turks
scorned
the
offer
at
about
this
time
an
egyptian
fleet
of
vessels
sailed
from
alexandria
and
joined
the
ottoman
fleet
in
the
bay
of
navarino
september
five
days
later
admiral
codrington
arrived
and
informed
the
turkish
admiral
that
any
attempt
to
leave
the
bay
would
be
resisted
by
force
french
vessels
had
also
arrived
and
ibrahim
agreed
not
to
leave
the
bay
without
consulting
the
sultan
a
greek
flotilla
having
destroyed
a
turkish
flotilla
ibrahim
took
this
as
a
breach
of
the
convention
and
sailed
out
to
sea
but
codrington
succeeded
in
turning
him
back
ibrahim
now
received
instructions
from
the
porte
to
the
effect
that
he
should
defy
the
powers
a
new
ultimatum
was
at
once
presented
and
the
allied
fleet
of
the
european
powers
entered
the
bay
of
navarino
the
fleet
was
disposed
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
without
further
parleying
as
the
fleet
of
the
english
and
their
allies
approached
the
turks
and
egyptians
began
to
fire
and
a
battle
ensued
apparently
without
plan
on
either
side
the
conflict
soon
became
general
and
admiral
codrington
in
the
opened
a
broadside
upon
the
egyptian
admiral
and
quickly
reduced
his
vessel
to
a
wreck
other
vessels
in
rapid
succession
shared
the
same
fate
and
the
conflict
raged
with
great
fury
for
four
hours
when
the
smoke
cleared
off
the
turks
and
egyptians
had
disappeared
and
the
bay
was
strewn
with
fragments
of
their
ships
illustration
a
distinguished
egyptian
jew
admiral
codrington
now
made
a
demonstration
before
alexandria
and
mehemet
ali
gladly
withdrew
his
forces
from
with
such
a
dangerous
ally
as
the
sultan
had
proved
himself
to
be
before
the
french
expedition
bound
for
the
morea
had
arrived
all
the
egyptian
forces

been
withdrawn
from

the
french
only
arrived

treaty

chief
ambition
had
always
been
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
regeneration
in
the
east
in
morea
he
had
failed
through
european
intervention
he
felt
that
his
nearer
neighbour
syria
which
he
had
long
coveted
would
be
an
easier
conquest
and
he
made
the
punishment
of
abdullah
pasha
of
acre
against
whom
he
had
many
grievances
his
excuse
to
the
porte
in
reality
it
was
a
case
of
attacking
or
being
attacked
through
a
firman
of
the
divan
of
constantinople
which
had
been
published
officially
to
the
european
powers
he
knew
that
his
secret
relations
with
mustapha
pasha
of
scodra
had
become
known
he
knew
also
that
letters
had
been
intercepted
in
which
he
offered
this
pasha
money
troops
and
ammunition
while
engaging
himself
to
march
on
the
capital
of
the
empire
and
that
these
letters
were
now
in
the
hand
of
the
sultan
mahmud
he
wras
also
informed
that
the
porte
was
preparing
to
send
a
formidable
army
to
egypt
and
his
sound
instinct
taught
him
what
to
do
in
this
position
ibrahim
pasha
was
appointed
of
the
invading
army
which
was
composed
of
six
regiments
of
infantry
four
of
cavalry
forty
and
many
provisions
artillery
and
ammunition
were
on

the
thousands
of

for
departure
when
cholera
broke
out
coming
from
india
after
having
touched
along
the
coasts
of
the
persian
gulf
it
had
penetrated
into
the
caravan
to

the
heat
and
dearth
of
water
had
given
it
fresh
intensity
it
raged
in

holy
town

down
twenty
thousand
victims

touched
at
jeddah

zambo
where
its
effects
were
very
dire
passing
through

it
decimated
the
population
and
in
august
it
reached
cairo
and
spread
to
upper
and

egypt
the
army
did
not
escape
the
common
scourge
and
when
about
to
invade
syria
was
overtaken
by
the
epidemic
five
thousand
out
of
ninety
thousand
perished
all
preparations
for
the
expedition
were
abandoned
until
a
more
temperate
season
improved
the
sanitary
conditions
about
the
beginning
of
october
the
viceroy
gave
orders
to
his
son
to
prepare
for
departure
and
on
november
the
troops
started
for
el
arish
the
general
of
the
army
ibrahim
pasha
went
to
alexandria
whence
he
embarked
with
his
staff
and
some
troops
for
landing
uniting
at

the
army
marched
on
gaza

took
possession
of
that
town
dispersing
some
soldiers

pasha

it
turned
to

it
met
with
no
resistance
the
turkish
garrison
having
already
evacuated
the
town
at
this
time
the
army
which
had
sailed
from
alexandria
was
cruising
about
the
port
of
jaffa
and
ibrahim
pasha
landed
there
and
took
over
the
command
of
the
army
which
advanced
slowly
on
jean
seizing
caiffa
to
facilitate
the
anchoring
of
the
fleet
which
had
landed
provisions

and
all
kinds
of
ammunition
after

many
valiant

since
the
repulse
of
napoleon
had
passed
for
all

impregnable
abdullah
pasha
evinced
a
desire
to
be
taken
to
egypt
and
he
landed
at
alexandria
where
he
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
viceroy
who
complimented
him
on
his
defence
hostile
in
everything
to
mehemet
ali
the
porte
seized
every
opportunity
of
injuring
him
when
sultan

learned
of
the
victory
of
the
troops
in
syria
he
sent
one
of
his
first
officers
to
enquire
the
reason
of
this
invasion
the
viceroy
alleged
grievances
against
the
pasha
of
acre
to
which
his
highness
replied
that
he
alone
had
the
right
to
punish
his
subjects
the
eyes
of
europe
were
now
fixed
upon
the
levant
where
a
novel
struggle
was
going
on
between
vassal
and
suzerain
authority
and
liberty
were
again
opposing
each
other
the
powers
watched
the
struggle
with
intense
interest
the
viceroy
protested
against
bearing
the
cost
of
the
war
and
demanded
the
investiture
of
syria
mehemet
ali
was
then
declared
a
rebel
and
a
firman
was
issued
against
him
in
support
of

excommunication
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
advanced
across

the

forbade

into

for
it
feared
that
the
viceroy
might
find
a
support
whose
strength
it
knew
only
too
well
but
the
viceroy
had
no
need
of
this
for
his
former
connections
with

put
him
in

then
marched
in
three
columns
on
horns
the
battle
of
horns
july
demonstrated
the
vast
superiority
of
the
egyptian
troops
on
both
sides
there
were
about
thirty
thousand
regular
soldiers
but
the
egyptians
were
the
better
organised
the
better
disciplined
and
the
more
practised
in
the
arts
of
war
when
it
is
remembered
that
at
horns
the
turks
lost
two
thousand
men
killed
and
taken
prisoners
while
the
egyptian
casualties
were
only
killed
and
wounded
one
is
not
astonished
at
the
enthusiasm
with
which
ibrahim
pasha
wrote
after
the
battle
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
of
such
troops
would
cause
me
no
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
beaten
pashas
were
so
struck
with
terror
that
in
their
flight
they
abandoned
sixteen
more
pieces
of
artillery
and
all
the
ammunition
they
had
managed
to
save
from
their
defeat
they
fled
as
if
they
could
not
put
sufficient
distance
between
themselves
and
their
redoubtable
enemy
this
battle
foretold
the
result
of
the
syrian
campaign
the
population
of
syria
seemed
to
call
for
the
domination
of
the
conqueror
the
viceroy
protested
his
submission
to
the
porte
and
his
desire
for
peace
and
meanwhile
ibrahim
pasha
marched
forward
the
porte
counted
on
its
fleet
to
guard
the
dardanelles
but
it
needed
an
army
and
a
commander
to
oppose
ibrahim
pasha
who
again
defeated
the
turks
at
he
then
advanced
towards
the
plains
of
anatolia
where
he
met
rashid
pasha
it
was
now
december
and
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
a
thick
fog
the
armies
opened
fire
on
each
other
on
december
with
the
town
of
koniah
in
the
background
the
grand
vizier
was
at
the
head
of
close
on
sixty
thousand
men
while
the
egyptian
army
only
comprised
thirty
thousand
including
the
bedouins
the
fighting
had
continued
for
about
six
hours
when
rashid
pasha
was
taken
prisoner
the
news
of
his
capture
spread
along
the
turkish
lines
and
threw
them
into
disorder
and
the
egyptians
remained
masters
of
the
field
with
twenty
pieces
of
mounted
cannon
and
some
baggage
the
turks
had
lost
only
five
hundred
men
while
the
egyptian
losses
were
but
two
hundred
the
battle
of
koniah
was
the
last
act
in
the
syrian
drama
the
throne
was
shaken
and
its
fall
might
involve
great
changes
in
the
politics
of
the
world
ibrahim
pasha
was
only
three
journey
from
the
bosphorus
and
the
way
was
open
to
him
with
no
turkish
army
to
fight

mehemet
ali
had
a
powerful
party
and
if
the
west
did
not
interfere
the
ottoman
empire
was
at
an
end
however
european
diplomacy
considered
that
in
spite
of
its
weakness
it
should
still
weigh
in
the
balance
of
the

trembling
in
the

of
his

sultan
mahmud
cried
for
help

heard
the
call
this
was
the
power
that
either
from
sympathy
or
ambition
was
the
most
inclined
to
come
to
his
aid
the
emperor
nicholas
had
offered
assistance
in
a
letter
brought
to
the
sultan
by
the
russian
general
mouravieff
and
a
russian
squadron
appeared
in
the
bosphorus
with
eight
thousand
men
for
disembarkment
the
russians
however
agreed
not
to
set
foot
on
shore
unless
mehemet
ali
should
refuse
the
conditions
that
were
being
proposed
to
him
the
viceroy
refused
the
conditions
which
limited
his
possessions
to
the
pashalics
of
acre
tripoli
and
seyd
and
which
seemed
to
him
incompatible
with
the
glory
won
by
his
arms
the
sultan
did
not
wish
to
give
up
syria
but
that
province
was
no
longer
his
the
sword
of
ibrahim
had
severed
the
last
bonds
that
fastened
it
to
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
yield
it
as
well
as
the
district
of
andama
on
his
side
the
viceroy
acknowledged
himself
a
vassal
of
the
porte
and
agreed
to
make
an
annual
payment
of
the
monies
he
received
from
the
pashas
of
syria
this
peace
was
concluded
on
may
and
was
called
the
peace
of
kutayeh
after
the
place
where
ibrahim
signed
it
it
was
impossible
that
the
convention
of
kutayeh
should
be
more
than
an
armistice
the
pasha
benefited
by
it
too
greatly
not
to
desire
further
advantages
and
the
sultan
had
lost
so
much
that
he
must
needs
make
some
attempt
at
recovery
annoyance
was
caused
by
the
fact
and
nature
of
the
dispossession
rather
than
by
its
material
extent
the
descendant
of
the
ever
implacable
in
his
hatreds
who
had
allowed
syria
the
cradle
of
his
race
to
be
wrested
from
him
now
awaited
the
hour
of
vengeance
mehemet
ali
knew
himself
to
be
strong
enough
to
carry
a
sceptre
ably
and
he
realised
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
his
numerous
pashalics
to
pass
out
of
his
family
henceforth
his
mind
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
independence
and
the
rights
of

this
untimely
demise
at

spared
him

the
political
history
of
mehemet
ali
was
now
at
an
end
all
the
results
good
or
bad
of
his
career
had
reached
fulfilment
as
a
vanquished
conqueror
he
had
been
able
to
remain
firm
in
the

of
catastrophe
his
fatherly
ideas
and
feelings
had
been
his
salvation
had
he
been
absolutely
heroic
he
would
have
considered
it
a
duty
for
his
courage
and
his
sake
to
carry
the
struggle
on
to
the
bitter
end
and
to
perish
in
the
whirlpool
he
had
raised
he
showed
that
he
desired
to
act
thus
but
in
his
interests
he
refrained
and
this
was
we
believe
the
only
influence
of
importance
which
made
him
give
way
it
is
true
that
there
was
not
much
difference
between
a
throne
crumbling
to
ruins
or
one
built
thereon
such
as
it
was
however
it
seemed
firmly
secured
to
his
children
and
it
was
for
them
to
strengthen
the
foundations
the
pasha
considered
this
a
fitting
reward
for
his
labours
as
for
himself
he
was
over
seventy
years
of
age
and
ready
to
lay
down
his
burdens

took
account
of
the

of
any
undertaking
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
difficulties
surmounted
in

and
this
characteristic
made
him
commit

to
treat
men
as

which
he
put

his
lively

his
freedom

he
knew
so
well
how

captivated
his

was

itself
to
the

who
surrounded

were

made
one
great
mistake
with

his

reproach
him

that
is
with

profited
by
the
leisure

an
easier

important
work
the

enterprise

weak
in

this
was
well
for
egypt
as

representative
was
able
to
hold
in

his
silent
hostility
to
western
civilisation
such
guardianship
is
useful
when
exercised
over
a
prince
like
abbas
pasha
but
it
tends
to
become
troublesome
and
baneful
when
it
attempts
to
interfere

an
active
and
enlightened
sovereign
animated
by
just
and
generous
intentions

also

him
a

of

of
which
he
gave
proof
from
the
moment
of
his
accession

was
imbued

give

to

and

aims
he
had
not
however
the
strength
of
character
nor
the
health
necessary
to
meet
the
serious
difficulties
involved
in
such
a
task
and
he
will
be
chiefly
remembered
by
his
abolition
of
the
more
grinding
government
monopolies
and
for
the
concession
of
the
suez
canal
after

was
born
on

being
the
second
of

three
sons
of

of

at

major
at

and
when
ahmed
the
eldest
son
of
ibrahim
died
in
ismail
became
the
heir
to
his
uncle
said
he
had
been
employed
after
his
return
to
egypt
on
missions
to
the
sovereign
pontiff
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
and
the
sultan
of
turkey
in
the
year
he
was
despatched
with
an
army
of
men
to
quell
an
insurrection
in
the
sudan
which
undertaking
he
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
on
ascending
the
throne
he
was
much
gratified
to
find
that
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
cotton
resulting
from
the
civil
war
in
america
the
revenues
had
very
considerably
increased
from
the
export
of
the
egyptian
cotton
at
this
date
the
cotton
crop
was
worth
instead
of
which
was
the
normal
value
of
the
egyptian
output
it
was
a
very
serious
misfortune
to
egypt
that
during
his
sojourn
abroad
ismail
had
learned
many
luxurious
ways
and
had
also
discovered
that
european
nations
were
accustomed
to
make
free
use
of
their
credit
in
raising
sums
of
money
for
their
immediate
advantage
from
this
moment
ismail
started
upon
a
career
which
gave
to
egypt
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
fictitious
grandeur
and
which
made
him
one
of
the
most
rulers
among
the
cabinets
and
peoples
of
the
european
countries
he
began
by
transferring
his
own
private
debts
to
the
state
and
thereafter
looked
upon
egypt
merely
as
his
private
estate
and
himself
as
the
sovereign
landholder
without
any
sense
of
his
responsibility
to
the
egyptians
themselves
he
increased
his
own
fame
throughout
europe
in
the
sumptuous
fashion
of
a
spendthrift
millionaire
he
deemed
it
necessary
for
his
fame
that
egypt
should
possess
institutions
modelled
upon
those
of
european
countries
and
he
applied
himself
with
energy
to
achieve
this
and
without
any
stint
of
expense
by
burdening
posterity
for
centuries
to
come
ismail
during
the
two
decades
subsequent
to
his
accession
always
had
a
supply
of
ready
money
with
which
to
dazzle
european
guests
during
his
entire
reign
egypt
swarmed
with
financiers
and
schemers
of
every
description
to
whom
the
complacent
ismail
lent
an
only
too
willing
ear
in
the
year
in
return
for
an
increase
of
tribute

obtained
from
the
sultan

its

and
hollow
magnificence
moved
towards
the
one
inevitable
result
of

the
price
of
all
the
transient
splendour
was
the
surrender
by
slow
degrees
of
the
sovereignty
and
independence
of
egypt
itself
the

withdrawn
their

themselves

and
the

contracted

all
progress
in
the
later
history
of

has
originated
in
the
desire
of
the
european
powers
to
see
egypt
in
a
position
capable
of
meeting
her
indebtedness
to
foreign
bondholders
in
so
far
as
the
cry
raised

a
protest
against
forcing

assumed
indebtedness
which
was
at

four
times
greater
than
anything
they
had
actually
received
no
movement
was
ever
more
just

righteous
than
the
protest
of

against
foreign
control
a
movement
which

associated
with
the

egypt
after

of
heroic
struggles

modelled
his
career
upon
that
of
his
illustrious
grandfather
rather
than
that
of
napoleon
with
which
it
shows
many
striking
parallels
it
is
probable
that
the
advantage
secured
to
egypt
through

becoming

the

egypt
to
understand
how
this
came
to
pass
it
is
necessary
to
review
the
account
of
the
financial
embarrassments
of
ismail
in
twelve
years
he
had
extracted
more
than
from
the
fellaheen
in
taxes
he
had
borrowed
another
from
europe
at
the
same
time
of
which
nominal
sum
he
probably
received
in
cash
the
loans
were
ostensibly
contracted
for
public
works
possibly
ten
per
cent
of
the
borrowed
money
was
profitably
laid
out
the
railways
were
extended
upper
egypt
was
studded
with
sugar
factories
most
of
them
doomed
to
failure
and
certain
roads
and
gardens
were
made
about
the
city
of
cairo
the
remainder
of
this
enormous
sum
of
money
was
spent
in
purchasing
a
change
in
the
law
of
succession
and
the
new
title
of
khédive
in
disastrous
abyssinian
campaigns
in
multiplying
shoddy
palaces
and
in
personal
extravagance
which
combined
oriental
profusion
with
the
worst
taste
of
the
second
empire
useless
works
engaged
the
corvee
the
fellaheen
were
evicted
from
vast
tracts
which
became
estates
and
their
crops
cattle
and
even
seed
were
taken
from
them
by
the
so
that
they
died
by
hundreds
when
a
low
nile
afflicted
the
land
the
only
persons
who
flourished
in
time
were
foreign
speculators
and
adventurers
of
the
lowest
type
as
these
conditions
became
more
serious
the
khédive
attempted
to
find
some
means
of
protection
against
the
he
adopted
a
suggestion
of
the
wise
nubar
pasha
and
instituted
the
mixed
tribunals
for
adjudging
civil
cases
between
natives
and
foreigners
the
powers
agreed
to
the
establishment
of
these
tribunals
and
intended
to
enforce
the
decisions
of
the
courts
even
in
case
that
ismail
himself
were
the
delinquent
when
later
the
khédive
repudiated
the
mixed
tribunals
this
action
precipitated
his
fall
it
became
increasingly
difficult
for
the
khédive
to
meet
his
accumulated
obligations
the
price
of
cotton
had
fallen
after
the
close
of
the
american
war
and
there
was
less
response
from
the
impoverished
people
to
the
which
in
was
still
more
strictly
enforced
and
soon
this
enforcement
by
the
mixed
tribunal
of
debts
due
to
foreigners
by
an
agricultural
population
who
lived
by
borrowing
and
were
accustomed
to
settle
their
debts
by
haggling
aggravated
the
misery
of
the
fellaheen
and
led
to
that
universal
despair
which
was
to
give
strength
and
significance
to
the
arabist
revolt
it
was
no
uncommon
procedure
for
the
levantine
to
accompany
the
into
the
provinces
with
a
chest
of
money

paid
the
taxes
of
the
assembled
and
destitute
fellaheen

in
return
were
obliged
to
give
mortgages
on
their
crops

be

a
state
of
wild
confusion

the
financial
situation
the
minister

pasha
sadeck
was
now
arrested
and
banished
to
dongola
there
was
an
immediate
prospect

by

france
commissioners
were
appointed
to
constitute
a
caisse

interest
due

the
great
mass
of
the
debt
was
then
unified
but
the
goschen
and
joubert
arrangement
was
found
to
be
too
severe
for
the
impoverished
country
a
low
nile
and
a
famine
resulted
in
a
demand
for
an
investigation
into
the
administration
and
the
following
year
ismail
was
obliged
to
authorise
a
commission
of
inquiry
the
waste
extravagance
and
wholesale
extortion
from
the
peasantry
revealed
by
this
report
made
a
deep
impression
upon
europe
and
ismail
was
forced
to
disgorge
the
estates
which
he
had
received
from
the
fellaheen
in
the
meantime
the
khédive
was
not
inactive
in
taking
measures
to
prevent
the
advent
of
a
confirmed
foreign
control
he
created
a
constitutional
ministry
upon
whom
the
responsibility
rested
for
the
different
branches
of
the
administration
he
likewise
fomented
an
outburst
of
feeling
among
the
moslems
against
the
foreign
element
in
the
constitutional
ministry
this
was
intended
to
strengthen
the
element
in
the
government
and
ismail
thus
hoped
to
demonstrate
to
the
european
powers
the
uselessness
of
attempting
to
subordinate
the
egyptians
to
foreign
methods
of
finance
and
control
ismail
subsequently
dismissed
the
ministry
and
soon
afterwards
the
controllers
themselves
knowing
well
the
jealousy
which
existed
between
england
and
france
he
believed
that
there
was
a
chance
that
he
might
successfully
play
off
one
power
against
the
other
if
the
moslems
had
not
been
so
severely
oppressed
by
taxation
and
ismail
had
acted
with
courage
and
firmness
it
is
probable
that
he
might
have
held
his
own
and
egypt
might
have
refused
to
again
accept
the
dual
control
bismarck
now
intervened
and
hinted
to
the
sultan
that
he
would
receive
the
support
of
the
powers
and
abdul
hamid
immediately
sent
a
telegram
to
the
egyptian
government
that
ismail
pasha
was
deposed
from
the
khedivate
at
this
moment
his
courage
gave
way

surrendered
his
throne

and

to

there
were
now
two
parties
in

the

movement
was
of
the
least

the
number
and
quality
of
the
circassians
had
deteriorated
but
they
still
held
the
most
important
posts
the
fellaheen
officers
under
arabi
who
had
been
brought
to
protest
against
reductions
in
the
military
establishment
now
claimed
that
the
circassians
should
make
way
for
the
egyptians
together
with
this
military
dissatisfaction
was
also
a
strong
civil
movement
towards
national
reform
which
included
a
number
of
serious
and
sensible
administrative
reforms

pasha
was
the
leader
of
the
national
party
and
had
hopes
of
convincing
people
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
but
many
influences
some
good
and
some
bad
were
at
work
simultaneously
to
divert
him
from
constitutional
methods
towards
making
his
appeal
to
the
violent
and
fanatical
element
just
at
this
time

divergence
between
english
and

views

the
control

unprogressive
turks
england
aimed
at
the
maintenance
of
the
much
talked
of
integrity
of
the
ottoman
empire
the
french
premier
gambetta
was
determined
that
there
should
be
no
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
turks
he
drafted
the
in
january
and
induced
lord
granville
the
english
foreign
secretary
to
give
his
assent
this
note
contained
the
first
distinct
threat
of
foreign
intervention
the
result
was
a
genuine
and
spontaneous
outburst
of
moslem
feeling
all
parties
united
to
protest
against
foreign
intervention
joined
by
the
fellaheen
who
now
saw
an
opportunity
of
freeing
themselves
from
foreign
usurers
to
whom
they
had
become
so
unjustly
indebted

gambetta
was
replaced
by
the
hesitating
freycinet
who
looked
upon
the
intervention
with
alarm
and
upon
germany
with
suspicion
england
was
thus
at
the
last
moment
left
to
act
alone
past
experience
had
taught
her
that
the
destiny
of
egypt
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
dominant
of
the
mediterranean
and
that
egypt
must
not
be
neglected
by
the
masters
of

after
a
vain
attempt
to
bring
about
mediation
through

of

it
was
discovered
that
the
nationalist
party
was
too
little
under
control
to
be
utilised
in
any
further
negotiations
ahmed
arabi
pasha
had
greatly
increased
his
influence
and
had
finally
been
appointed
minister
of

on
the
of
june
there
was
serious
rioting
in
which
many
greeks
and
maltese
four
englishmen
and
six
frenchmen
were
slain
arabi
now
stepped
forward
to
preserve
order
being
at
this
moment
practically
the
dictator
of
egypt
while
endeavouring
to
maintain
order
he
also
threw
up
earthworks
to
protect
the
harbour
of
alexandria
and
trained
the
guns
upon
the
british
fleet
the
admiral
in
charge
sir
beauchamp
seymour
who
was
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
channel
squadron
sent
word
to
the
egyptians
to
cease
the
construction
of
fortifications
the
request
was
not
fully
assented
to
although
it
was
reinforced
by
an
order
from
the
porte
an
ultimatum
was
presented
on
july
commanding
arabia
to
surrender
the
forts
the
terms
were
refused
and
eight
ships
and
five
gunboats
prepared
for
action
on
the
following
day
at
the
same
time
the
french
fleet
retired
upon
port
said
the
first
shot
was
fired
on
july
at
seven
in
the
morning
by
the
alexandrians
and
in
reply
an
iron
hail
rained
upon
the
forts
of
the
egyptians
from
the
guns
of
the
british
fleet
troops
fought
well
and
aimed
correctly
but
their
missiles
were
incapable
of
penetrating
the
armour
of
the
ironclads
one
fort
after
another
was
silenced
lord
charles
beresford
in
command
of
the
gunboat
led
a
brilliant
attack
upon
fort
marabout
the
firing
on
the
next
day
and
a
flag
of
truce
was
soon
displayed
after
some
unsatisfactory
parleying
the
bombardment
was
resumed
and
when
a
second
flag
of
truce
was
unfurled
it
was
discovered
that
arabi
pasha
had
retreated
to
fourteen
miles
away
from
alexandria
on
his
departure
the
city
was
given
over
to
plunder
and
destruction
the
convicts
escaped
from
the
prison
and
joining
forces
with
the
arabs
looted
and
burned
the
european
quarters
two
thousand
persons
mostly
greeks
and
levantines
were
slain
and
an
enormous
quantity
of
property
destroyed
admiral
seymour
then
sent
a
body
of
sailors
on
land
who
patrolled
the
streets
and
shot
down
the
looters
and
order
was
thus
finally
restored
in
alexandria
the
khédive
who
was
forced
to
fly
for
his
life
to
an
english
steamer
was
reinstated
in
the
palace
under
an
escort
of
seven
hundred
marines
the
british
admiral
was
afterwards
severely
criticised
for
not
having
put
a
stop
to
the
rioting
before
it
assumed
such
serious
proportions

now
increased

a
proclamation
dismissing
arabi
from

service

enforce
the
submission
of

important
victory

at
and

were

anxious
to
win
a
decisive
victory

was
sending
from

regulars
of

number
were

seventy
guns
and
they
were
also
aided
by
bedouins
though
well
situated
the
army
of
arabi
was
taken
by
surprise
and
the
following
day
in
response
to
the
various
flanking
movements
of

british
directed
by

the
egyptian
government
wished
to
try
arabi
as
a
rebel

a
secret

it
was
generally
believed
that
this
would
have
meant
a
death

vigorous
protest
in
favour
of
an

personally
contributed
to
the
defence

led
to
the
commutation

was
offered

however
refused

finally
determined
upon
independent
action

the
officials
through

the
two
governments
had
hitherto
exercised

a

was
appointed

was
not
allowed
to
take

the
outline
of

adjustment
was
given
in

circular
note
addressed
by

declared
that

was

a
religious
insurrection
which
had
originated
two
years
previously
was
forced
upon
the
notice
of
the
government
it
has
already
been
related
that
the
ismailian
sect
of
the
muhammedans
had
introduced
the
doctrine
of
a
coming
messiah
or
mahdi
who
was
to
be
the
last
of
the
imans
and
the
incarnation
of
the
universal
soul
not
a
few
impostors
had
exploited
this
doctrine
to
their
own
advantage
and
some
of
the
arabian
tribes
were
firmly
convinced
that
the
mahdi
had
come
and
that
the
mahdis
who
had
appeared
to
their
kinsmen
elsewhere
were
merely
clever
charlatans
in
the
year
muhammed
ahmet
a
religious
leader
among
the
moslem
arabs
in
the
central
african
provinces
of
kordofan
and
darfur
proclaimed
himself
as
the
mahdi
and
called
upon
the
muhammedans
to
initiate
a
holy
war
the
continued
advances
were
rendered
possible
by
the
precarious
state
of
affairs

started
up

struck
across

were
decoyed
into

after
three
fighting
his
whole
army
was
annihilated

withdraw
from

it
was
decided
that
the
western
provinces
of
kordofan
and

should
be
abandoned
but
that
important
centres
like
khartum
on
the
nile
should
be
preserved
at

for
a
time

all
the
egyptian

were
to
congregate

the
revolting
arab
tribes
called
by
the
general
name

would
not
come
to
friendly
terms
with

then
in
time
it
was
decided
that
khartum
itself
and
every
other
locality
in

sudan
should
be
entirely
relinquished
except
the
ports
of

to
make
terms
with

and
prepare

eventualities
the
evacuation
of
this
place
was
almost
immediately
decided
upon
by
the
british
cabinet
and
gordon
arrived
on
february
but
being
unsupported
by
european
troops
he
found
the
position
an
exceedingly
difficult
one
to
maintain

scorned
his
overtures

was
daily
closing

landed

later
on
was
fought
the
battle
of

during
which
a
body
of

rushed
the

broke
up

were
on

they
managed
to
recover
the
lost

scatter

general
situation
was
now
extremely
critical
it
was
hoped
that
an

might
advance
from

and
then
ascend

delays
in

autumn
of

army
under

were
organised
to
make
a
rush
across

desert
on
the
of

came
up
with
the
enemy
and
fought
the
decisive

were
mown
down
by
rifles
and
as
soon
as
they
were
within
short
range
immediately
after
the
battle
sir
charles

determined
to
use
the
egyptian
flotilla
to
make
an
immediate

were
protected
and
a
small
relief
force
started
on

they
came
in

of
khartum
on
the
but
were
fired
upon
from
every
side
at
this
moment
a
native
called
from
the
bank
that
the
city
had
fallen
and
that
the
heroic
gordon
had
been
killed
a
history
of
egypt
would
be
incomplete
without
some
account
of
that
leader
whose
bravery
humanitarian
views
and
understanding
of

oriental
character
have
made
him
famous
among

fresh
from
his
laurels
won
in
the
service
of

journeyed
to

up

to
take
up

he
laboured
with
incessant
energy

to
secure
the
welfare

he
established
a
series
of
egyptian

along

abyssinian
frontier
and
made
a
survey
of

returning
to

delay
he
was
appointed

in
is
one
of
the
greatest
tragedies
of

supported
neither
by

nor
by
the
english
army
of
a
different
religion
from
all
his
followers
pressed
on
all
sides
by
the
forces
gordon
gallantly
kept
his
few
faithful
followers
at
his
side
and
with
incessant
activity
and
heroism
protected
the
remaining
egyptian
colonists
of
the
cities
along
the
nile
over
which
he
still
held
control
he
had
called
upon
the
british
government
to
send

across
the
desert
from

berber
but
this
request
had
been
denied
him

then
fell
and
he
was
cut
off
to

many
hundred
miles
of

nearly
a
month
before

had
written
on

that

he
could
have
successfully
kept
up
the
defence
as
his
army
had
been
starving
since
the
of

it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
he
managed
to
hold
out
till
january
the
on
this
date
two
days
before
the
relief
expedition
approached
the
troops
attacked
khartum
and
finding
men
too
weak
to
fight
the
defences
were
cut
down

was
killed
by
a
shot
at
the
head
of
the
steps
of
the

upon
learning
of
the
death
of
gordon
the
relief

retreated
finding
that
the
object
of

had
proved
to

a

it
was
a
source
of
much
gratification
that

met
with
a
fearful
disaster
in
fighting
against

at
the
battle
of
adowa
on
march
they
were
holding
kassala
within
the

then
went
on

mission
to

where
he
found
the
italians
anxious
to

thereupon
made
an
agreement
whereby
the
egyptians
should
occupy
the
place
which
was
accordingly
accomplished
under

on

day
disagreements
among

made
its
final
advance
upon
khartum
there
were
ten
thousand
british
troops
and
fifteen
thousand
egyptians
the
forces
were
concentrated
at
wady
hamed
sixty
miles
above
omdurman
from
which
point
they
bombarded
the
city
with
shells
filled
with
deadly
lyddite
and
the
mosque
and

of
the
late
mahdi
were
destroyed
at

within
four
miles
of

they
saw
the
whole
army

of
from
forty
to
fifty
thousand
men
advancing
to
confront
them
from
behind
the

in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
with

resting
upon
the
banks
of

river
at
intervals
along
the
whole
line
of
the
army
were
and
maxims
and
the
gunboats
were
within
reach
to
aid
in
shelling
the
enemy
the
british
soldiers
then
built

their
egyptian
allies
dug
defensive
trenches
on
the
front
and

dervishes
came
on
in
great
strength
but
when
the
maxims
the
and
the
repeating
rifles
opened
fire
upon
them
at
a
comparatively
close
range
a
frightful
havoc
was
the
result
all
who
remained
to
fight
were
immediately
shot
down
and
the
whole
field
was
cleared
in
fifteen
minutes
the
dervishes
retreated
behind
the
hills
and
were
joined
by
fresh
forces
general
macdonald
in
making
a
detour
with
a
body
of
lancers
was
suddenly
beset
by
two
thousand
dervish
riflemen
who
fiercely
charged
him
on
three
sides
quickly
forming
a
square
he
succeeded
by
desperate
efforts
in
repelling
the
enemy
until
he
was
reinforced
by
kitchener
who
perceived
his
desperate
situation
the
calif
then
attacked
the
extreme
left
wing
of
the
army
but
was
again
driven
off
the
were
now
in
a
position
to
deliver
the
main
attack
upon
the
dervish
defences
the
troops
of
the
califa
fought
with
heroic
bravery
fearlessly
advancing
within
range
of
the
fire
but
each
time
they
were
mown
down
by
the
cross
fire
of
the
maxims
and
rifles
vast
numbers
were
slain
and
some
divisions
of
the
dervishes
suffered
complete
annihilation
they
left
ten
thousand
dead
upon
the
field
and
ten
thousand
wounded
the
rest
fled
in
all
directions
a
scattered
and
straggling
force
with
the
califa
himself
the
lost
but
two
thousand
men
few
prisoners
were
taken
for
in
almost
every
instance
the
dervishes
refused
to
surrender
and
even
when
wounded
used
their
swords
and
spears
against
the
rescuers
of
the
ambulance
corps
all
the
fighting
was
over
by
midday
and
in
the
afternoon
general
kitchener
entered
omdurman
and
the
army
encamped
in
the
vicinity
slatin
bey
was
duly
installed
as
governor
in
the
name
of
the
egyptian
khédive
the
european
prisoners
of
the
califa
were
now
released
and
on
sunday
the
of
september
the
sirdar
and
all
his
army
held
a
solemn
service
in
memory
of
general
gordon
near
the
spot
where
he
was
killed
bodies
of
men
were
now
sent
out
on
all
sides
to
pacify
the
country
and
the
sirdar
who
had
been
elevated
to
the
peerage
as
lord
kitchener
of
khartum
started
on
an
expedition
up
the
nile
in
a
gunboat
in
order
to
settle
the
difficult
question
arising
from
the
occupation
of
pashoda
by
a
french
corps
under
major
marchand
the
ability
and
strategy
of
this
french
commander
were
of
a
very
high
order
the
general
plan
of
the
expedition
had
been
in
accord
with
french
military
traditions
based
upon
former
attempts
in
india
and
america
to
separate
the
british
colonial
dominions
or
to
block
the
way
to
their
extension
by
establishing
a
series
of
military
outposts
or
forts
at
certain
strategic
points
chosen
for
this
purpose
had
the
french
designs
under
desaix
in
india
or
of
the
army
of
occupation
in
the
mississippi
valley
in
the
eighteenth
century
been
supported
by
a
powerful
fleet
there
is
no
doubt
that
british
colonisation
would
have
suffered
a
severe
setback
if
major
marchand
remained
in
fashoda
the
route
to
all
the
upper
regions
of
the
nile
would
be
cut
off
from
any
english
or
egyptian
enterprise
accordingly
lord
kitchener
ran
the
risk
of
grave
international
complications
by
advancing
upon
fashoda
to
meet
major
marchand
fortunately
a
temporary
agreement
was
entered
upon
that
the
home
governments
should
decide
the
question
at
issue
and
lord
kitchener
then
hoisted
the
flag
south
of
the
french
settlement
and
the
officers
fraternised
over
glasses
of
champagne
it
is
now
believed
that
russia
would
have
aided
france
if
it
had
come
to
a
war
but
the
french
government
thought
the
affair
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
an
international
struggle
over
the
retention
of
fashoda
and
the
respective
spheres
of
influence
of
france
and
great
britain
were
finally
agreed
upon
early
in
the
following
year
by
the
niger
convention
which
left
the
whole
of
the
provinces
under
british
protection
as
far
south
as
the
equatorial
lakes
and
as
far
west
as
the
border
line
between
darfur
and
wadai
the
calif
was
subsequently
pursued
from
place
to
place
in
the
desert
and
was
at
length
overtaken
by
colonel
wingate
at
om
dubreikat
the
dervish
leader
fought
a
desperate
fight
and
refusing
to
fly
was
slain
with
all
his
personal
followers
on
november
the
total
cost
of
these
campaigns
had
been
incredibly
small
not
amounting
in
all
to
the
total
of
and
the
railroad
the
cost
of
which
is
here
included
in
the
expenditure
is
of
permanent
value
to
egypt
after
the
of
khartum
it
was
again
as
in
time
made
the
seat
of
government
the
dervish
capital
having
been
located
across
the
nile
at
omdurman
for
a
memorial
to
gordon
was
enthusiastically
raised
in
england
the
memorial
took
the
practical
form
of
an
educational
establishment
for
the
natives
of
the
sudan
the
of
which
was
laid
by
lord
cromer
in
january
the
school
is
intended
to
be
exclusively
for
muhammedans
and
only
the
moslem
religion
is
to
be
taught
within
its
walls
though
the
mahdism
of
which
the
late
califa
had
been
the
leading
spirit
had
degenerated
into
a
struggle
of
versus
civilisation
the
calif
at
least
showed
conspicuous
courage
in
the
manner
in
which
he
faced
his
death
for
the
last
twenty
years
during
which
the
revolts
of
the
dervishes
had
troubled
the
outlying
provinces
of
the
egyptian
dominions
trade
had
been
almost
at
a
standstill
large
numbers
of
blacks
had
been
enslaved
an
equal
number
probably
had
been
slaughtered
and
whole
regions
depopulated
the
total
population
was
cut
down
during
these
years
to
of
what
it
previously
had
been
and
it
was
of
vital
importance
to
egypt
to
reconquer
all
the
lost
provinces
which
lay
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
nile
if
the
prosperity
of
egypt
is
to
rest
upon
a
sound
basis
and
not
be
subjected
to
periodic
overthrow
at
the
hands
of
the
hostile
inhabitants
of
the
south
it
is
essential
that
the
upper
nile
should
be
under
the
control
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
egypt
is
the
gift
of
the
nile
and
the
entire
population
of
egypt
is
dependent
upon
this
river
to
secure
prosperity
for
the
country
and
to
develop
egyptian
resources
to
the
fullest
extent
the
rulers
of
egypt
must
also
be
the
rulers
of
the
nile
when
the
expedition
under
kitchener
set
out
to
reconquer
the
sudan
the
development
of
egypt
had
been
progressing
in
all
directions
at
a
rapid
rate
having
greater
interests
to
defend
less
indebtedness
to
meet
and
greater
facilities
for
meeting
the
taxes
due
the
home
government
no
less
than
the
foreign
bondholders
the
time
was
ripe
in
which
to
take
that
great
step
towards
securing
the
prosperity
of
egypt
in
the
future
by
finally
destroying
the
community
of
slaveholders
which
under
the
sanction
of
mahdism
brutally
tyrannised
over

population

the
english
have
been
engaged
in
persevering
efforts
at
reform
in
every
branch
of
the
administration
the
reforms
which
they
instituted
in
the
different
departments
of
the
army
finance
public
works

popular
the

found
out
that
they
could
not
use
methods
of
extortion
the
upper
classes
the
pashas
and
the
wealthy
landowners
also
discovered
that
they
were
not
at
liberty
to
do
as
they
pleased
and
that
the
english
inspectors

irrigation
strictly
regulated

has
since
been
fully
demonstrated
that
the
curtailing
of
their
privilege
to
make
use

when
and
how
they
chose
is
more
than
compensated

improved
conditions

ten

now
nearly
eleven

boundaries

egypt
has
always
been
a
very
populous
country
by
the
effort
to
expand
this
area
of
irrigation
the
way
was
prepared
for
a
considerable
increase
in
the
total
population
there
are
sections
of
this
land
where
the
density
of
the
population
averages
from
seven
to
eight
hundred
or
even
a
thousand
persons
to
the
square
mile
in
early
times
the
population
was
still
greater
as
the
irrigation
area
was
increased
by
the
great
reservoir
of
lake
mceris
when
omar
made
a
census
there
were
to
be
found
six
million
kopts
exclusive
of
the
aged
the
young
and
the
women
and
three
hundred
thousand
greeks
this
would
imply
even
at
that
decadent
period
a
total
population
of
fifteen
million
the
increased
prosperity
shown
by
the
railroads
is
most
satisfactory
two
hundred
and
twelve
miles
of
new
railroad
have
been
constructed
and
an
enormous
development
of
the
railroad

telegraph
business
has
resulted
since
the
year
railroad
development
has
been
very
rapid
and
with
the
line

amounted
in
to
some
two
thousand

sudan
railway
it
is
intended
ultimately
to
extend
a
railroad
system
through
the

of
africa
from
cairo
to
capetown
great
progress
has
been
made
in
all
departments
of
public
works
hundreds
of
agricultural
roads
have
been
built
and
the
mileage
of
canals

has
been
largely
increased

the
very
great
benefit

quantity

doubled

price

reduced

forty
per

the
tonnage
of

issued
to

under

appearance

the
most
serious
obstacle
to
the
progress

has
been
the
authority
of
the
mixed
administrations
the
chief
of
which

profligate

were

the

folly
of
the

lavish

was
now
demonstrated

the

precedent
immediately
vetoed
the

england
then
made

to
egypt
which
both
aided
the
egyptian
government
and
greatly
strengthened
her
hold
upon
egypt
by
means
of
this
timely
assistance
egypt
was
enabled
successfully
to
pass
through
the
period
of
increased
expenditure
incurred
by
the
reconquest
of
the
sudan
during
the
lifetime
of
khedive
tewfik
who
owed
his
throne
to
the
british
occupation
there
had
been
little
or
no
disagreement
between
the
british
and
egyptian
authorities
in
the
year
sir
henry
drummond
wolff
prepared
a
convention
in
accordance
with
which
england
promised
to
leave
egypt
within
three
years
from
that
date
at
the
last
moment
the
sultan
urged
by
france
and
russia
refused
to
sign
it
and
the
occupation
which
these
two
powers
would
not
agree
to
legalise
even
for
a
period
of
three
years
was
now
less
likely
than
ever
to
terminate
the
following
year
tewfik
dismissed
nubar
pasha
who
had
by
the
advice
of
the
foreign
powers
stood
in
the
way
of
reforms
planned
by
the
english
officials
tewfik
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
abbas
hilmi
pasha
called
officially
abbas
ii
he
was
born
in
and
was
barely
of
age
according
to
turkish
law
which
fixes
magistracy
at
eighteen
years
of
age
in
the
case
of
the
succession
to
the
throne
he
came
directly
from
the
college
at
vienna
to
cairo
where
his
accession
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
and
the
firman
confirming
him
in
all
the
powers
privileges
and
territorial
rights
which
his
father
had
enjoyed
was
read
from
the
steps
of
the
palace
in
abdin
square
for
some
time
the
new
khédive
did
not
cooperate
with
cordiality
with
great
britain
he
was
young
and
eager
to
exercise
his
power
his
throne
had
not
been
saved
for
him
by
the
british
as
his
had
been
and
he
was
surrounded
by
intriguers
who
were
scheming
always
for
their
own
advantage
he
at
first
appeared
almost
as
unprogressive
as
his
abbas
but
he
later
learned
to
understand
the
importance
of
british
counsels
during
his
visit
to
england
in
he
frankly
acknowledged
the
great
good
which
england
had
done
in
egypt
and
declared
himself
ready
to
cooperate
with
the
officials
administering
british
affairs
this
friendliness
was
a
great
change
from
the
disposition
which
he
had
shown
in
previous
years
during
the
dispute
between
himself
and
sir
evelyn
baring
regarding
the
appointment
of
egyptian
officials
the
controversy
at
one
time
indicated
a
grave
crisis
and
it
is
reported
that
on
one
occasion
the
british
agent
ordered
the
army
to
make
a
demonstration
before
the
palace
and
pointed
out
to
the
young
ruler
the
folly
of
forcing
events
which
would
inevitably
lead
to
his
dethronement
the
tension
was
gradually
relaxed
and
compromises
brought
about
which
resulted
in
harmony
between
the
khédive
and
the
british
policy
of
administration
and
no
one
rejoiced
more
than
abbas
hilmi
over
the
victory
of
omdurman
illustration
bazar

agricultural
interests
are
dearer
to

the
only
explanation
which
has
been
given
to

is
that
there
are

the

nearly
all
this

has
been
covered
by
the
sediment
of
the

from
the
earliest
times
there
have
been
numerous
distinct
branches
or
channels
of
the
river
running
out
by
separate
openings
into
the
sea
as
several
of
these
branches
have
been
tapped
to
a
great
extent
for
irrigation
all
except
two
have
ceased
to
be
true
outlets
of
the

in
the
greek
period
there
were
seven
mouths
and
several
greek
or
the
two
remaining
mouths
are
those
of
rosetta
and
damietta
and
these
were
always
the
most
important
of
the
number
they
branched

the
fork
has
gradually
shifted

lower

triangular
space
enclosed
by
these
two

called
by
the

twofold
purpose
of
reclaiming
many
thousand
acres
of
waste
land
and
of
regulating
the
discharge
and
the
navigation
through
the
delta
the
idea
was
originated
by
a
frenchman
in
his
service
named
linant
bey
this
engineer
desired
to
alter
the
course
of
the
river
and
build
a
weir
at
a
point
farther
to
the
north
where
the
contour
of
land
seemed
to
favour
the
design
more
than
that
of
the
present
locality
mehemet
ali
thought
his
plans
too
costly
and
accepted
in
preference
those
of
mougel
bey
unexpected
difficulties
were
encountered
from
the
very
beginning
mehemet
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
hurry
the
work
and
mougel
bey
had
only
made
a
beginning
when
an
exceptionally
high
nile
carried
away
all
the
lime
in
the
concrete
base
mehemet
ali
did
not
live
to
see
the
completion
of
this
work
the
object
could
it
have
been
realised
was
to
hold
up
the
waters
of
the
nile
during
the
eight
months
of
the
ebb
and
thus
keep
them
on
a
level
with
the
soil
and
at
the
same
time
to
supply
lower
egypt
with
an
amount
of
water
equal
to
that
which
came
down
during
it
was
hoped
to
cover
the
very
large
expenditure
by
the
additional
land
which
it
was
expected
would
come
under
irrigation
and
by
doing
away
with
the
primitive
and
setting
free
for
productive
enterprise
the
numerous
army
of
the
agricultural
labourers
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
time
in
slowly
raising
up
buckets
of
water
from
the
nile
and
pouring
them
into
the
irrigating
channels

was
never
what
it
was

to
be
after
the

it
ceased
to
be
of
any
practical
utility
and
was
merely
an
impediment

the

it
proved
to
be
of
the
greatest
advantage
in
saving
labour
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of

a

and
in
the
irrigation
and
navigation
facilities
that
had
been
contemplated
as
among
the
benefits
which
would
naturally
accrue
from
its
successful
completion

with
the

seaward
at
the
estuary
of
the
mississippi
and
the

the
advance
of
the
nile
seaward
is
very
slow
this
is
accounted
for
by
the
geological
theory
that
the
delta
of
the
nile
is
gradually
sinking
if
this
is
so
the
tendency
of
the
periodical
deposit
to
raise
the
level
of
the
delta
will
be
counteracted
by
the
annual
subsidence
these
phenomena
account
for
the
gradual
burial
of
egyptian
monuments
under
the
sand
although
the
actual
level
of
the
sea
above
what
it
formerly
was
is
quite
unappreciable
the
periodical
rise
in
the
nile
recurring
as
regularly
as
the
revolutions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
necessarily
remained
an
unsolved
mystery
to
the
ancients
for
until
the
discovery
of
the
tropical
regions
with
their
mountainous
lakes
and
deluging
rains
it
was
impossible
to
learn
the
occasion
of
this
increase
it
is
now
known
that
the
blue
nile
flowing
out
of
the
mountainous
parts
of
abyssinia
is
the
sole
cause
of
the
periodic
overflow
of
the
nile
without
the
tropical
rains
of
the
ethiopian
tablelands
there
would
be
no
great
rise
nor
any
fertilising
deposits
without
the
white
nile
which
runs
steadily
from
the
perennial
reservoirs
of
the
great
central
african
lakes
the
lower
nile
would
assume
the
character
of
an
intermittent
wady
such
as
the
neighbouring
khor
baraka
periodically
flushed
by
the
discharge
of
the
torrential
downpours
from
abyssinia
though
there
is
a
periodical
increase
in
the
flow
of
the
upper
waters
of
the
white
nile
yet
the
effect
of
this
lower
down
is
minimised
by
the
dense
quantities
of
vegetable
drift
which
combining
with
the
forest
of
aquatic
growth
forms
those
vast
barriers
known
by
the
name
of
which
not
only
arrest
navigation
but
are
able
to
dam
up
large
bodies
of
water
the
sudd
it
is
supposed
stopped

advance
of
the
roman
centurions
who
were
sent
up
the
nile
in
the
days
of
nero
sir
samuel
baker
was
the
one
who
first
pointed
out
the
great
disadvantage
of
allowing
the
vegetable
matter
to
accumulate
both
to
merchants
and
to
those
who
were
employed
to
suppress

innumerable

at

part
of

customarily
float
a
marsh

extent

been
formed

all
appearance
as

narrates
the
white
nile
had
disappeared

through
fifty
miles

urged
the
khédive
to
reopen

nile
the
work
was
successfully
undertaken
by
ishmail
ayub
pasha
and
the
white
nile
became
clear
for
large
vessels
when

reached

is
practically
impossible
to
keep
the

rebel
dervishes

the
nile
was
completely
blocked

the
alarming
failure
of

generally
attributed
to
this
blockade

placed
at
the
disposal

white
nile

accumulation

the

the
exception

when
it
happens

most
disastrous
the

effected
by

absorption
the
first
lands
to
be
affected
are
not
those
which
are
nearest
to
the
dyke
but
those
which
are
of
the
lowest
level

percolating

this
underground
moisture
is
what
is
counted
upon

it
is
fed
by

the

are
of

in

egypt
is
the
mahmudiyeh
canal
connecting
alexandria
with
the
rosetta
branch
and
following
the
same
direction
as
an
ancient
canal
which
preceded
it
mehemet
ali
constructed
this
canal
which
is
about
fifty
miles
long
and
one
hundred
feet
broad
it
is
believed
that
twelve
thousand
labourers
perished
during
its
construction
between
the
rosetta
and
the
damietta
branches
of

there
are
other

from

east
of

are
other
canals
occupying
the
ancient
of

branches
of

of
the

who
executed
this
work
under
the
caliph
in
order
to
bring
water
into
the
province
of
sharkiyah
this
last
canal
is
connected
with
the
remains
of
the
one
which
in
ancient
times
joined
the
nile
with
the
red
sea
after
falling
into
neglect
it
has
again
in
part
been
restored
and
much
increased

canal
further
mention
may
also
be
made
of
the
great
canal
called
the
or
river
joseph
which
is
important
enough
to
be
classed
as
a
ramification
of
the
nile
itself
as
has
been
mentioned
this
water
way
runs
parallel
with
the
nile
on
the
west
side
below
cairo
for
about
miles
to
farshut

is
the
most
important
irrigation
canal
in

it
is
a

of
canals

than
one

tradition
states
that
this
canal
was
repaired
by
the
celebrated
saladin
another
tradition
relating
that
the
canal
existed
in
the
time
of
the
pharaohs
has
recently
been
proved
to
be
correct
egypt
possesses
not
only
the
greatest
natural
water
way
in
the
world
but
also
the
greatest
artificial
water
way
the
suez
canal
before
the
opening
of
this
canal
there
were
in
the
past
other
canals
which
afforded
communication
between
the
red
sea
and
the
mediterranean
these
ancient
canals
differed
in
one
respect
from
the
suez
canal
since
they
were
all
fed
by
the
fresh
waters
of
the
nile
one
of
these
still
remains
in
use
and
is
called
the
fresh
water
canal
according
to
aristotle
strabo
and
pliny
sesostris
was
the
first
to
conceive
and
carry
out
the
idea
of
a
water
connection
between
the
two
seas
by
means
of
the
pelusiac
branch
of
the
nile
from
avaris
to
bubastis
and
by
rendering
navigable
the
irrigation
canal
which
already
existed
between
bubastis
and
heroopolis
it
is
believed
by
some
that
the
fragment
bearing
the
oval
of
ramses
ii
found
near
the
course
of
the
present
canal
affords
confirmation
of
this
assertion
the
first
authentic
account
of
the
carrying
out
of
the
conception
of
an
water
way
is
to
be
found
in
the
time
of
pharaoh
necho
about
the
year
herodotus
records
of
necho
that
he
was
first
to
attempt
the
construction
of
the
canal
to
the
red
this
canal
tapped
the
nile
at
bubastis
near
zagazig
and
followed
closely
the
line
of
modern
wady
canal
to
heroopolis
the
site
of
which
lies
in
the
neighbourhood
of
toussun
and
serapeum
between
the
bitter
lakes
and
lake
tinseh
at
that
date
the
red
sea
reached
much
farther
inland
than
it
does
now
and
was
called
in
the
upper
portion
the
heroopolite
gulf
the
expanse
of
brackish
water
now
known
as
the
bitter
lakes
was
then
in
all
probability
directly
connected
with
the
red
sea
the
length
of
this
canal
according
to
pliny
was
miles
or
about
english
miles
this
length
allowing
for
the
sinuosity
of
the
valley
traversed
agrees
with
the
distance
between
the
site
of
old
bubastis
and
the
present
head
of
the
bitter
lakes
the
length
given
by
herodotus
of
more
than
one
thousand
stadia
miles
must
be
understood
to
include
the
whole
distance
between
the
two
seas
both
by
the
nile
and
by
the
canal
herodotus
relates
that
it
cost
the
lives
of
men
to
cut
the
canal
he
says
that
the
undertaking
was
abandoned
because
of
a
warning
from
an
oracle
that
the
barbarians
alone
meaning
the
persians
would
benefit
by
the
success
of
the
enterprise
illustration
hieroglyphic
record
of
an
ancient
canal
the
true
reason
for
relinquishing
the
plan
probably
was
that
the
egyptians
believed
the
red
sea
to
have
been
higher
in
altitude
than
the
nile
they
feared
that
if
the
canal
were
opened
between
the
nile
and
the
red
sea
the
salt
water
would
flow
in
and
make
the
waters
of
the
nile
brackish
this
explanation
would
indicate
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
locks
and
sluices
on
the
part
of
the
egyptians
the
work
of
necho
was
continued
by
darius
the
son
of
hystaspes
the
natural
channel
of
communication
between
the
heroopolite
gulf
and
the
red
sea
had
begun
to
fill
up
with
silt
even
in
the
time
of
necho
and
a
hundred
years
later
in
the
time
of
darius
was
completely
blocked
so
that
it
had
to
be
entirely
cleaned
out
to
render
it
navigable
the
traces
of
this
canal
can
still
be
plainly
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shaluf
near
the
south
end
of
the
bitter
lakes
the
present
canal
was
also
made
to
follow
its
course
for
some
distance
between
that
point
and
suez
persian
monuments
have
been
found
by
lepsius
in
the
neighbourhood
commemorating
the
work
of
darius
on
one
of
these
the
name
of
darius
is
written
in
the
persian
cuneiform
characters
and
on
a
cartouche
in
the
egyptian
form
until
this
date
it
therefore
appears
that
ships
sailed
up
the
pelusiac
branch
of
the
nile
to
bubastis
and
thence
along
the
canal
to
heroopolis
where
the
cargoes
were
transhipped
to
the
red
sea
this
inconvenient
transfer
of
cargoes
was
remedied
by
the
next
egyptian
sovereign
who
bestowed
much
care
on
the
water
connection
between
the
two
seas
ptolemy
philadelphus
in
addition
to
cleaning
out
and
thoroughly
restoring
the
two
canals
joined
the
canal
with
the
heroopolite
gulf
by
means
of
a
lock
and
sluices
which
permitted
the
passage
of
vessels
and
were
effective
in
preventing
the
salt
water
from
mingling
with
the
fresh
water
at
the
point
where
the
canal
joined
the
heroopolite
gulf
to
the
red
sea
ptolemy
founded
the
town
of
arsinoë
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
modern
suez
the
line
of
communication
between
the
two
seas
was
impassable
during
the
reign
of
cleopatra
it
is
believed
by
some
that
it
was
restored
during
the
reign
of
the
roman
emperor
trajan
during
this
period
the
pelusiac
branch
of
the
nile
was
very
low
the
water
having
almost
completely
deserted
this
formerly
course
if
trajan
therefore
undertook
to
reopen
the
water
way
he
must
have
tapped
the
nile
much
higher
up
in
order
to
reach
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
the
old
canal
near
cairo
which
elsewhere
joined
the
line
of
the
former
canal
on
the
way
to
the
bitter
lakes
was
once
called
trajanus
and
from
this
it
has
been
inferred
that
trajan
was
really
the
builder
and
that
during
his
reign
this
canal
was
cleaned
and
rendered
navigable
as
there
is
no
further
evidence
than
the
name
to
prove
that
trajan
undertook
so
important
an
enterprise
the
was
probably
constructed
during
the
arabic
period
when
amr
had
conquered
egypt
according
to
another
account
the
caliph
omar
ordered
him
to
ship
rich
supplies
of
grain
to
mecca
and
medina
because
during
the
pilgrimages
these
cities
and
often
the
whole
of
hedjaz
suffered
severely
from
famine
as
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
send
large
quantities
of
provisions
across
the
desert
on
the
backs
of
camels
it
is
supposed
that
to
facilitate
this
transportation
omar
ordered
the
construction
of
the
canal
from
a
point
near
cairo
to
the
head
of
the
red
sea
on
account
of
his
forethought
in
thus
providing
for
the
pilgrims
to
the
hedjaz
omar
received
the
title
of
of
the
emir
which
thenceforth
was
adopted
by
his
successors
in
the
caliphate
one
hundred
and
years
after
this
time
the
second
caliph
of
the
abbasid
dynasty
is
said
to
have
closed
the
canal
to
prevent
supplies
from
being
shipped
to
one
of
the
descendants
of
ali
who
had
revolted
at
medina
since
that
time
it
is
probable
that
it
has
never
been
reopened
although
there
is
a
report
that
the
sultan
hakim
rendered
it
available
for
the
passage
of
boats
in
the
year
after
which
it
was
neglected
and
became
choked
with
sand
while
not
thereafter
used
for
navigation
there
were
parts
which
during
the
time
of
the
annual
inundation
of
the
nile
were
filled
with
water
until
mehemet
ali
prevented
this
the
parts
filled
during
the
inundation
extended
as
far
as
sheykh
hanaydik
near
toussun
and
the
bitter
lakes
the
old
canal
which
left
the
nile
at
cairo
had
long
ceased
to
flow
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
the
still
more
ancient
canal
from
the
neighbourhood
of
bubastis
now
known
as
the
wady
canal
extended
only
a
few
miles
in
the
direction
of
the
isthmus
as
far
as
kassassin
during
the
construction
of
the
suez
canal
the
need
of
supplying
the
labourers
with
fresh
water
was
imperative
the
company
therefore
determined
in
to
prolong
the
canal
from
kassassin
to
the
centre
of
the
isthmus
and
in
the
year
they
brought
the
canal
as
far
as
suez
in
one
or
two
places
the
bed
of
the
old
canal
was
cleared
out
and
made
to
serve
the
new
canal
the
level
of
the
canal
is
about
twenty
feet
above
that
of
the
suez

it
joins
at

the
difference
of

between
it

remedied
by

was
the
first
in

to
take
up
the
subject
of

connection
between
the
two

in
he
examined
the
traces
of
the
old
canal

and
ordered
monsieur
lepère
to
survey
the
isthmus
and
prepare
a
project
for
uniting
the
two
seas
by
a
direct
canal
the
result
of
this
french
labours
was
to
discover
a
supposed
difference
of
thirty
feet
between
the
red
sea
at
high
tide
and
the
mediterranean
at
low
tide
as
this
inequality
of
level
seemed
to
preclude
the
idea
of
a
direct
maritime
canal
a
compromise
was
recommended
owing
to
the
exertions
of
lieutenant
waghorn
the
route
through
egypt
for
the
transmission
of
the
mails
between
england
and
india
was
determined
upon
in

oriental

established
a
service
of
steamers
between
england
and
alexandria
and
between
suez
and
india
in
spite
of
this
endeavour
nothing
was
actually
accomplished
with
regard
to
a
canal
until
when
a
mixed
commission
was
appointed
to
enquire
into
the
subject
this
commission
entirely
exploded
the
error
into
which
lepère
had
fallen
in
reporting
a
difference
of
level
between
the
two
seas
a
plan
was
projected
in
by
linant
bey
and
mougel
bey
under
the
superintendence
of
de
who
had
already
received
a
firman
of
concession
from

this
plan
recommended
a
direct
canal
between
suez
and
pelusium
which
should
pass
through
the
bitter

end

to
the
centre
of
the
isthmus
and
thence
through

was
also
proposed
this
project
was
in
submitted
to
an
international
commission
company
composed
of
representatives
from
england
france
italy
the
netherlands
austria
prussia
and
spain
and
the
following
modification
was
suggested
that
the
line
of
the
canal
to
the
north
should
be
slightly
altered
and
brought
to
a
point
seventeen
and
a
half
miles
west
of
pelusium
this
change
being
determined
upon
from
the
fact
that
the
water
at
this
point
was
from
to
thirty
feet
deep
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
coast
whereas
at
pelusium
this
depth
of
water
was
only
to
be
found
at
a
distance
of
five
miles
from
the
coast
it
was
suggested
that
the
plan
for
locks
be
abolished
and
the
length
of
the
jetties
at
suez
and
port
said
be
diminished
various
other
details
of
a
minor
character
were
determined
and
this
project
was
finally
accepted
and
carried
through
by
the

obtained

by

meanwhile
the

under
the
influence
of

secretary
endeavoured
for
various
political
reasons
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
enterprise

so
far
succeeded

this
unworthy
attempt

prevent

finding
that

was
formally
commenced

this
was
followed
by
the
establishment
of
working

in

parts
of
the
isthmus
although
the
first
steps
were
thus
taken
incredible
difficulties
prevented

from
pushing
forward

his
work
towards
the
close
of

the
principal
work
done
in
was
the
continuation

point
a

arose
which
threatened
to
stop
the
work
altogether
among
the
articles
of
the
concession
of
was
one
providing
that
of
the
workmen
on
the
canal
should
be
egyptians
said
pasha
consented
to
furnish
these
workmen
by
conscription
from
different
parts
of
egypt
and
the
company
agreed
to
pay
them
at
a
rate
equal
to
about
less
than
was
given
for
similar
work
in
europe
and
more
than
they
received
in
their
own
country
and
to
provide
them
with
food
dwellings
etc
in
principle
this
was
the
or
forced
labour
the
fellaheen
were
taken
away
from
their
homes
and
set
to
work
at
the
canal
though
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
as
well
treated
and
better
paid
than
at
home
the
injustice
and
impolicy
of
this
clause
had
always
been
insisted
upon
to
the
sultan
by
the
english
government
and
when
ismail
pasha
became
viceroy
in
the
year
he
saw
that
the
constant
drain
upon
the
working
population
required
to
keep
twenty
thousand
fresh
labourers
monthly
for
the
canal
was
a
loss
to
the
country
for
which
nothing
could
compensate
in
the
early
part
of
he
refused
to
continue
to
send
the
monthly
contingent
and
the
work
was
almost
stopped
by
the
consent
of
all
the
parties
the
subjects
in
dispute
were
submitted
to
the
arbitrage
of
the
french
emperor
napoleon
who
decided
that
the
two
concessions
of
and
being
in
the
nature
of
a
contract
and
binding
on
both
parties
the
egyptian
government
should
pay
an
indemnity
equal
to
the
fellah
labour
and
for
the
resumption
of
the
lands
originally
granted
two
hundred
metres
only
being
retained
on
each
side
of
the
canal
for
the
erection
of
workshops
the
deposit
of
soil
and
for
the
canal
and
the
right
of
levying
tolls
on
it
the
egyptian
government
undertook
to
keep
it
in
repair
and
navigable
and
to
allow
the
company
free
use
of
it
for
any
purpose
the
sum
total
of
these
payments
amounted
to
and
was
to
be
paid
in
sixteen
instalments
from
to
the
company
now
proceeded
to
replace
by
machinery
the
manual
labour
and
thanks
to
the
energy
and
ingenuity
of
the
principal
contractors
borel
and
lavalley
that
which
seemed
first
of
all
to
threaten
destruction
to
the
enterprise
now
led
to
its
ultimate
success
without
the
machinery
thus
called
into
action
it
is
probable
that
the
canal
would
never
have
been
completed
when
it
was
the
ingenuity
displayed
in
the
invention
of
this
machinery
and
its
application
to
this
vast
undertaking
constituted
one
of
the
chief
glories
in
the
enterprise
of
de
lesseps
the
work
now
proceeded
without
interruption
of
any
kind
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
became
evident
that
more
money
would
be
needed
and
a
subscription
was
opened
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
by
means
of
one
hundred
dollar
shares
issued
at
a
share
and
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
five
dollars
a
share
when
more
money
was
needed
in
the
government
agreed
to
renounce
the
interest
on
the
shares
held
by
it
for
years
and
more
bonds
were
issued
by
help
of
these
subventions
and
loans
the
work
was
pushed
onward
with
great
vigour
the
sceptical
were
gradually
losing
their
scepticism
and
all
the
world
was
awakening
to
see
what
an
immense
advantage
to
civilisation
the
triumph
of
de
engineering
enterprise
would
be
illustration
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
the
great
frenchman
had
shown
consummate
skill
as
an
organiser
but
still
more
perhaps
as
an
astute
diplomatist
who
knew
how
to
upset
the
machinations
of
his
numerous
and
powerful
opponents
by
judicious
of
policy
by
the
beginning
of
the
great
labours
of
the
company
had
very
nearly
reached
their
completion
the
waters
flowing
from
the
mediterranean
first
entered
into
the
bitter
lakes
on
march
ismail
pasha
was
present
to
watch
the
initial
success
of
the
grand
undertaking
and
predicted
that
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
the
canal
would
be
open
to
the
ships
of
all
the
world
the
first
steamer
which
made
the
passage
was
one
which
carried
de
lesseps
on
board
and
which
steamed
the
whole
length
of
the
canal
september
in
an
interval
of
fifteen
hours
this
was
a
great
triumph
for
the
intrepid
and
persevering
engineer
whose
enterprise
had
been
scoffed
at
by
many
men
of
the
greatest
european
fame
and
the
completion
of
which
had
been
delayed
by
incredible
obstacles
arising
from
jealousy
or
want
of
funds
by
this
time
the
unworthy
tactics
of
the
former
palmerston
ministry
of
great
britain
in
opposition
to
a
scheme
of
such
universal
helpfulness
to
commerce
had
been
succeeded
by
an
official
interest
in
the
success
of
the
enterprise
which
grew
from
sentiment
in
the
first
instance
to
a
willingness
later
to
buy
up
all
the
shares
held
by
the
egyptian
government
de
lesseps
gave
formal
notice
early
in
september
that
the
canal
would
be
opened
for
navigation
on
november
the
khédive
made
costly
preparations
in
order
that
the
event
might
become
an
international
celebration
invitations
were
sent
to
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
the
sultan
refused
to
be
present
but
the
empress
eugenie
accepted
the
invitation
in
the
name
of
the
french
people
the
austrian
emperor
the
prussian
crown
prince
and
prince
amadeus
of
italy
also
took
part
in
the
festivity
the
initial
ceremony
was
on
november
at
port
said
emperor
francis
joseph
landed
at
midday
and
was
received
with
pomp
and
magnificence
by
the
khedive
ismail
there
were
splendid
decorations
in
the
streets
and
triumphal
arches
were
raised
meanwhile
salutes
were
exchanged
between
the
batteries
and
the
ships
of
war
in
the
harbour
at
night
there
were
gorgeous
illuminations
and
fireworks
the
khédive
gave
a
grand
ball
on
his
own
yacht
at
which
the
emperor
of
austria
and
all
the
distinguished
guests
were
in
attendance
the
french
empress
then
arrived
in
alexandria
and
was
received
by
ismail
and
francis
joseph
with
salutes
of
guns
and
the
acclamations
of
the
people
the
next
day
the
french
imperial
yacht
aigle
with
the
empress
on
board
proceeded
to
steam
up
the
canal
being
followed
by
forty
vessels
they
reached
ismailia
after
eight
hours
and
a
half
and
were
there
met
by
vessels
coming
from
the
south
end
at
suez
on
november
the
fleet
of
steamers
led
by
the
french
imperial
yacht
set
out
for
suez
they
anchored
overnight
at
the
bitter
lakes
and
on
november
the
whole
fleet
of
steamers
arrived
at
suez
and
entered
the
red
sea
the
empress
accompanied
by
the
visiting
fleet
returned
on
november
and
reached
the
mediterranean
on
the
england
the
country
which
more
than
any
other
had
opposed
the
progress
of
the
canal
derived
more
benefit
than
any
other
country
from
its
completion
in
the
british
government
bought
shares
from
the
khédive
for
a
sum
of
nearly
and
at
the
present
time
the
value
of
these
shares
has
risen
more
than
fourfold
by
this
acquisition
the
british
government
became
the
largest
shareholder
of
the
shipping
which
avails
itself
of
this
route
to
the
east
which
is
shorter
by
six
thousand
miles
than
any
other
about
eighty
per
cent
is
british
in
of
ships
with
a
grain
tonnage
of
as
many
as
of
tons
were
british
extensive
works
were
undertaken
in
for
the
widening
of
the
canal
illuminated
buoys
and
electric
lights
have
been
introduced
to
facilitate
the
night
traffic
so
that
proceeding
continuously
instead
of
stopping
overnight
ships
can
now
pass
through
in
less
than
twenty
hours
in
place
of
the
or
forty
hours
which
were
formerly
taken
to
effect
the
passage
these
greater
facilities
postponed
the
need
of
discussing
the
project
for
running
a
parallel
canal
to
the
east
which
some
time
ago
was
thought
to
be
an
impending
necessity
on
account
of
the
blockage
of
the
canal
by
the
number
of
vessels
passing
through
its
course
by
the
convention
of
the
canal
had
acquired
an
international
character
both
the
water
way
itself
and
the
isthmus
for
three
miles
on
either
side
were
declared
neutral
territory
exempt
from
blockade
fortification
or
military
occupation
of
any
kind
the
passage
is
to
remain
open
for
all
time
to
ships
of
all
nations
whether
they
are
or
merchantmen
or
liners
or
whether
the
country
to
which
they
belong
is
engaged
in
war
or
enjoying
peace
within
this
convention
was
included
the
canal
which
supplies
drinking
water
to
ismailia
and
port
said
and
all
the
floating
population
about
the
banks
of
the
suez
canal
on
april
by
the
terms
of
a
new
colonial
treaty
it
has
been
jointly
agreed
that
the
provisions
of
the
convention
of
shall
remain
in
force
for
the
next
thirty
years
egypt
was
the
scene
of
the
earliest
of
all
advances
in
engineering
science
the
system
of
irrigation
which
originated
in
the
days
of
the
oldest
egyptian
dynasties
has
remained
practically
the
same
through
all
the
intervening
centuries
until
very
recent
times
during
every
period
of
vigorous
government
the
rulers
of
egypt
paid
special
attention
to
irrigation
canals
and
sluices
through
which
the
flood
waters
could
be
brought
to
some
hitherto
uncultivated
area
the
famous
barrage
projected
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
only
rendered
efficient
for
what
it
was
intended
since
the
british
occupation
made
very
little
alteration
in
the
actual
supply
of
water
during
the
seasons
of
low
water
in
the
nile
the
most
serious
problem
is
how
to
ward
off
the
periodical
famine
years
of
which
there
has
been
record
from
the
earliest
ages
and
of
which
the
book
of
genesis
has
left
an
account
in
the
history
of
joseph
and
the
seven
years
of
plenty
and
seven
years
of
famine
without
creating
such
a
vast
reservoir
in
the
upper
waters
of
the
nile
that
the
storage
there
retained
can
be
available
in
years
of
low
water
to
fill
the
river
to
its
accustomed
level
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
the
calamity
occasioned
by
leaving
many
districts
of
egypt
without
cultivation
for
one
or
more
seasons
with
the
desire
of
accomplishing
this
sir
benjamin
baker
the
leading
authority
on
engineering
works
in
egypt
prepared
a
scheme
for
reserving
a
vast
storage
of
water
in
upper
egypt
at
aswan
it
was
also
decided
to
follow
up
the
enterprise
with
another
to
be
undertaken
at
assiut
on
february
the
khédive
approved
of
a
contract
with
john
aird
and
company
which
settled
the
question
of
the
nile
reservoir
and
the
scheme
for
the
great
dam
at
aswan
the
government
was
able
to
start
the
undertaking
without
any
preliminary
outlay
it
was
agreed
that
the
company
should
receive
the
sum
of
a
year
for
a
period
of
thirty
years
aswan
six
hundred
miles
south
of
cairo
was
selected
as
an
advantageous
site
because
the
nile
at
that
place
flows
over
a
granite
bed
and
is
shut
in
on
either
side
by
granite
rocks
which
when
the
course
of
the
river
is
barred
would
form
the
shores
of
the
artificial
irrigation
lake
before
this
work
started
there
had
been
a
long
controversy
as
to
the
effect
produced
by
the
rising
waters
upon
the
renowned
temple
on
the
isle
of
philæ
lord
leighton
the
president
of
the
royal
academy
had
vigorously
protested
against
allowing
the
destruction
of
this
famous
ancient
ruin
in
the
modification
of
the
plans
caused
by
this
protest
it
was
hoped
that
no
serious
harm
would
result
to
this
relic
of
ancient
egyptian
religion
and
art
illustration
approach
to
philae
the
enterprise
was
put
through
with
great
rapidity
the
project
fully
realising
the
designs
of
its
inaugurators
by
aid
of
this
great
structure
square
miles
have
been
added
to
the
area
of
the
miles
hitherto
subject
to
cultivation
its
value
to
the
country
is
at
the
least
worth
the
dam
extends
for
one
and
a
quarter
miles
and
possesses
openings
each
of
which
is
feet
high
and
will
altogether
allow
the
outpour
of
fifteen
thousand
tons
of
water
per
second
navigation
up
and
down
the
nile
has
not
been
impeded
since
by
a
chain
of
four
locks
vessels
are
able
to
pass
up
and
down
the
river
each
lock
is
feet
long
and
feet
wide
during
the
gates
of
the
dam
are
open
while
the
flood
is
subsiding
the
gates
are
gradually
closed
and
thus
in
a
long
season
of
low
water
the
reservoir
is
gradually
filled
up
for
use
through
a
system
of
canals
whereby
the
waters
can
be
drawn
off
for
irrigation
and
the
main
flow
of
the
nile
can
be
increased
the
lake
thus
formed
is
nearly
three
times
the
superficial
area
of
lake
geneva
in
switzerland
and
the
waters
are
held
back
for
a
distance
of
miles
up
the
course
of
the
river
the
reservoir
is
filled
during
the
months
of
january
and
february
and
from
april
to
the
end
of
august
the
water
is
let
out
for
irrigation
purposes
from
the
bottom
of
the
reservoir
thus
enabling
the
sediment
which
is
of
such
value
to
be
carried
out
through
the
sluices
four
or
five
waterings
are
allowed
to
percolate
from
it
to
the
various
regions
which
are
thus
brought
under
cultivation
and
besides
this
the
main
supply
of
the
river
itself
is
artificially
increased
at
the
same
time
the
dam
has
been
constructed
of
granite
ashlar
taken
from
quarries
near
aswan
these
quarries
are
the
very
same
from
which
the
ancient
obelisks
were
hewn
the
amount
of
rock
used
was
about
one
million
tons
in
weight
in
building
the
dam
it
was
found
to
be
very
difficult
to
lay
the
foundation
since
the
bottom
of
the
river
proved
to
be
unsound
although
in
the
preliminary
reports
it
had
been
declared
to
be
of
solid
granite
in
some
instances
it
was
found
necessary
to
dig
down
for
forty
feet
in
order
to
lay
a
perfectly
secure
foundation
on
which
the
heavy
wall
could
be
superimposed
this
required
much
additional
labour
and
great
risk
and
damage
was
encountered
during
the
progress
of
the
work
at
the
date
of
the
impending
rise
of
the
waters
of
the
nile
rubble
dams
were
raised
to
ward
off
the
waters
from
the
point
where
it
was
necessary
to
excavate
the
holes
were
gradually
filled
with
solid
blocks
of
granite
then
the
base
of
the
structure
one
hundred
feet
in
width
was
laid
and
the
massive
piers
capable
of
resisting
the
immense
pressure
of
the
water
during
the
height
of
the
floods
were
raised
and
the
whole
edifice
was
at
length
completed
with
great
rapidity
by
the
aid
of
many
thousand
workmen
just
before
the
rise
in
the
nile
occurred
the
official
opening
of
the
dam
took
place
on
the
of
december
the
dam
at
aswan
is
the
greatest
irrigation
project
ever
yet
undertaken
but
is
by
no
means
the
last
one
likely
to
be
executed
in
relation
to
the
waters
of
the
nile
a
smaller
dam
is
to
be
constructed
at
assiut
in
order
to
supply
a
system
of
irrigation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
and
also
to
carry
water
across
to
thousands
of
acres
between
this
region
and
cairo
this
project
is
planned
somewhat
after
the
design
of
the
barrage
which
is
below
cairo
it
is
impossible
to
forecast
what
engineering
skill
may
have
in
store
for
the
future
of
egypt
one
may
hope
at
least
that
the
most
prosperous
days
of
the
pharaohs
the
ptolemies
and
the
romans
will
be
reproduced
once
more
for
the
modern
egyptians
as
an
outcome
of
the
wise
administration
which
has
originated
through
the
occupation
of
the
country
by
the
english
as
an
international
trust
held
for
civilisation
by
aid
of
british
initiative
egypt
now
controls
a
vast
empire
in
equatorial
africa
and
the
sudan
and
the
great
water
ways
of
this
immense
territory
are
being
gradually
brought
under
such
control
that
the
maximum
advantage
to
all
the
population
will
be
the
necessary
result
the
whole
nile
is
now
opened
to
commerce
the
british
have
guaranteed
equal
rights
and
what
has
been
called
the
policy
of
the
door
for
the
commerce
of
all
nations
the
history
of
the
modern
exploration
of
the
nile
is
closely
associated
with
the
history
of
egypt
in
modern
times
the
men
who
first
visited
egypt
and
ascended
the
nile
valley
were
in
almost
every
case
the
early
egyptians
were
familiar
perhaps
with
the
nile
as
far
as
khartum
and
with
the
blue
nile
up
to
its
source
in
lake
tsana
but
they
showed
little
or
no
interest
in
exploring
the
white
nile
in
herodotus
entered
egypt
and
ascended
the
nile
as
far
as
the
first
cataract
he
then
learned
many
things
about
its
upper
waters
and
made
enquiries
about
the
territories
which
lay
beyond
he
heard
that
the
source
was
unknown
that
there
was
a
centre
of
civilisation
in
a
city
of
the
ethiopians
in
the
bend
of
the
nile
at
meroë
merawi
of
but
about
the
regions
beyond
he
was
unable
to
learn
anything
eratosthenes
the
earliest
geographer
of
whom
we
have
record
was
born
in
at
cyrene
north
africa
from
the
information
he
gathered
and
edited
he
sketched
a
nearly
correct
route
of
the
nile
to
khartum
he
also
inserted
the
two
abyssinian
affluents
and
suggested
that
lakes
were
the
source
of
the
river
when
rome
extended
her
domains
over
egypt
in
the
interest
of
the
romans
was
aroused
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
discovery
of
the
source
of
the
nile
strabo
set
out
with
ælius
gallus
the
roman
governor
of
egypt
on
a
journey
of
exploration
up
the
nile
as
far
as
philæ
at
the
first
cataract
about
greek
explorers
by
the
names
of
bion
dalion
and
were
engaged
in
active
exploration
of
the
nile
above
the
first
cataract
and
perhaps
south
of
khartum
according
to
the
account
of
pliny
the
elder
writing
in
the
emperor
nero
in
sent
an
expedition
up
the
nile
and
its
members
journeyed
as
far
as
the
modern
fashoda
and
perhaps
even
beyond
the
white
nile
their
advance
was
impeded
by
the
sudd
and
after
writing
discouraging
reports
their
attempt
was
abandoned
among
the
greek
merchants
who
traded
on
the
east
african
coast
was
one
named
diogenes
who
had
been
informed
by
an
arab
that
by
a
journey
one
could
gain
access
to
a
chain
of
great
lakes
two
of
which
were
the
headwaters
of
the
white
nile
they
also
said
that
there
was
a
mountain
range
named
from
its
brilliant
appearance
the
mountains
of
the
moon
he
was
informed
that
the
nile
formed
from
the
two
head
streams
flowed
through
marshes
until
it
united
with
the
blue
nile
and
then
it
flowed
on
until
it
entered
into
regions
diogenes
reported
this
to
a
syrian
geographer
named
marinus
of
tyre
who
wrote
of
it
in
his
during
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
the
writings
of
marinus
disappeared
it
is
supposed
when
the
alexandrian
library
was
scattered
but
luckily
gladius
ptolemy
quoted
them
and
thus
they
have
been
preserved
for
us
ptolemy
wrote
in
the
first
clearly
intelligible
account
of
the
origin
of
the
white
nile
the
two
lakes
victoria
and
albert
nyanza
and
the
mountains
of
the
moon
but
no
less
than
years
elapsed
before
justice
could
be
done
to
this
ancient
geographer
and
his
account
verified
it
was
sir
henry
stanley
who
discovered
the
ruwanzori
mountain
range
corresponding
to
the
classical
mountains
of
the
moon
and
who
thus
justified
view
of
the
topography
of
africa
for
many
years
after
ptolemy
the
work
of
exploring
the
sources
of
the
nile
was
entirely
discontinued
and
the
solution
of
the
problem
was
still
wrapped
in
impenetrable
mystery
the
first
modern
explorer
of
any
consequence
who
came
from
great
britain
was
a
scotchman
named
bruce
in
he
travelled
through
many
ports
of
northern
africa
and
visited
the
levant
and
subsequently
syria
and
palestine
wherever
he
went
he
drew
sketches
of
antiquities
which
are
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
landing
in
africa
in
he
went
up
the
nile
as
far
as
aswan
from
there
he
travelled
to
the
red
sea
and
reached
jiddah
the
port
of
hajas
he
then
returned
to
africa
stopping
at
massawra
and
from
there
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
abyssinia
the
emperor
received
him
with
favour
and
suffered
him
to
reach
the
blue
nile
which
to
the
mind
of
bruce
had
always
been
considered
as
the
main
stream
of
the
nile
having
determined
the
latitude
and
longitude
he
went
down
the
blue
nile
as
far
as
the
site
of
khartum
where
the
waters
of
the
white
nile
join
with
those
of
the
blue
nile
he
next
proceeded
to
berber
and
crossed
the
desert
to
korosko
returning
after
a
three
journey
in
the
year
in
journeying
through
france
many
learned
men
took
a
great
interest
in
the
story
of
his
explorations
but
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
to
hear
that
he
had
not
been
the
first
to
reach
the
sources
of
the
blue
nile
partly
for
this
reason
he
delayed
publishing
his
travels
for
seventeen
years
after
his
return
bruce
was
a
truthful
and
accurate
writer
but
nevertheless
his
book
was
received
on
all
sides
with
incredulity
although
received
at
the
british
court
he
was
not
given
any
special
honours
or
decorations
he
first
pointed
out
the
great
importance
to
england
of
controlling
the
egyptian
route
to
india
and
he
also
secured
for
english
merchants
a
concession
on
the
red
sea
in
john
ludwig
burckhardt
of
swiss
nationality
the
first
among
europeans
made
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
and
then
travelled
up
the
nile
to
korosko
after
which
he
crossed
the
desert
to
berber
and
shendy
his
death
occurred
after
his
return
to
cairo
and
he
left
a
valuable
collection
of
oriental
manuscripts
to
the
university
of
cambridge
england
which
were
published
after
his
death
in
a
belgian
named
adolphe
lisiant
ascended
the
white
nile
to
within
miles
of
khartum
the
expedition
which
he
led
was
aided
by
an
english
society
called
the
association
which
became
afterwards
a
part
of
the
royal
geographical
society
many
explorers
visited
the
white
nile
between
and
in
john
pethrick
a
welshman
explored
the
nile
for
coal
and
precious
metals
in
the
interest
of
mehemet
ali
after
the
death
of
this
pasha
pethrick
visited
in
kordofan
as
a
trader
and
remained
there
for
five
years
in
he
ventured
upon
an
enterprise
relating
to
the
ivory
trade
for
this
purpose
he
travelled
backwards
and
forwards
upon
the
white
nile
and
the
for
a
period
of
six
years
reaching
some
of
the
important
affluents
of
the
the
jur
and
the
jalo
or
the
rol
returning
to
england
he
was
commissioned
to
undertake
a
relief
expedition
to
help
captains
speke
and
grant
who
had
set
out
upon
their
journey
of
exploration
and
in
the
year
he
returned
to
central
africa
interest
in
the
deterred
him
from
following
the
directions
under
which
he
had
been
sent
out
namely
to
bring
relief
to
speke
and
grant
sir
samuel
baker
anticipated
him
in
relieving
the
expedition
and
this
so
angered
speke
that
he
attempted
to
have
pethrick
deprived
of
his
consular
position
pethrick
died
in
when
lieutenant
richard
francis
burton
had
completed
his
famous
journey
through
hedjaz
to
the
sacred
city
of
mecca
he
called
at
the
port
of
aden
at
the
southwest
extremity
of
arabia
while
there
he
made
friends
with
the
authorities
and
persuaded
them
to
allow
him
to
penetrate
africa
through
somaliland
which
is
situated
to
the
southwest
of
abyssinia
he
hoped
by
an
overland
journey
westbound
to
strike
the
nile
at
its
headwaters
john
speke
accompanied
burton
on
his
journey
and
thus
gained
his
first
experience
of
african
exploration
unfortunately
this
expedition
was
not
a
success
for
the
somali
were
so
suspicious
of
the
object
of
the
travellers
that
they
forced
them
to
return
to
the
coast
illustraton
the
main
stream
of
the
nile
once
more
in
the
same
party
started
farther
south
from
zanzibar
hearing
of
a
great
inland
lake
they
pressed
forwards
to
make
an
exploration
but
were
prevented
by
the
masai
tribes
burton
was
now
laid
up
with
fever
and
speke
formed
a
large
party
and
crossed
the
unyamivezi
and
usukuma
on
july
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
cross
one
of
the
bays
of
the
southern
half
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
they
struck
northwards
and
on
august
gained
sight
of
the
open
waters
of
the
great
lake
speke
did
not
realise
the
vast
area
of
the
lake
at
this
time
and
put
down
its
width
at
about
one
hundred
miles
as
he
had
promised
burton
to
return
at
a
certain
date
he
went
back
to
the
coast
burton
however
was
unreasonable
enough
to
be
displeased
with
discovery
and
the
two
fell
into
strained
relations
on
arriving
at
the
coast
speke
at
once
went
back
to
england
and
there
raised
funds
to
make
a
longer
and
more
complete
exploration
he
was
naturally
anxious
to
learn
more
about
the
great
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
continent
and
besides
this
he
thought
that
he
could
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
scientific
world
that
this
vast
basin
of
water
was
the
source
of
the
white
nile
captain
james
a
grant
asked
leave
to
accompany
speke
and
became
his
efficient
lieutenant
grant
was
a
good
shot
a
matter
of
importance
for
it
was
almost
certain
that
the
party
would
have
to
confront
the
danger
of
being
surrounded
by
wild
beasts
and
hostile
natives
he
was
also
a
good
geologist
and
painted
well
in
and
proved
himself
to
be
a
capable
lieutenant
to
the
leader
of
the
party
the
indian
government
sent
the
expedition
a
quantity
of
ammunition
and
surveying
instruments
the
party
started
from
zanzibar
for
the
interior
in
october
at
usugara
they
were
detained
by
the
illness
of
captain
grant
and
some
of
the
hottentot
retainers
a
number
of
the
instruments
were
now
sent
back
in
order
to
lighten
the
burdens
and
among
other
things
was
returned
the
cumbrous
photographic
apparatus
which
was
the
only
kind
in
use
in
the
sixties
at
ugogo
serious
trouble
arose
with
the
native
chiefs
who
demanded
tolls
from
the
party
many
of
the
remaining
porters
here
deserted
and
others
were
frightened
by
the
hostility
of
the
local
tribes
when
at
length
they
reached
the
unyamivezi
most
of
the
beasts
of
burden
had
died
and
half
of
the
stores
they
had
intended
to
bring
with
them
were
found
to
have
been
stolen
by
the
natives
the
arabs
here
told
speke
that
there
was
another
lake
besides
the
victoria
whose
waters
according
to
some
were
reported
to
be
salty
fierce
internecine
wars
were
now
being
waged
between
the
tribes
of
the
locality
which
made
any
thought
of
progress
so
long
as
they
lasted
an
impossibility
speke
having
successfully
endeavoured
to
negotiate
a
peace
between
the
chief
mouwa
and
the
arabs
of
the
region
resolved
upon
the
bold
enterprise
of
pushing
on
without
grant
and
the
supplies
towards
buzina
the
nearest
country
ruled
by
bahima
chiefs
the
venture
however
was
a
fruitless
one
and
he
bravely
struggled
to
reach
usui
in
this
he
succeeded
remaining
there
till
october
when
he
went
through
the
region
of
the
suwaroras
who
demanded
excessive
tolls
for
permission
to
pass
through
their
territory
proceeding
into
the
wilderness
they
were
met
by
envoys
from
rumanika
a
king
whose
court
they
intended
to
visit
and
who
had
heard
in
advance
of
their
impending
journey
the
messengers
of
the
king
received
them
well
and
brought
them
to
the
court
rumanika
now
desired
them
to
remain
at
his
capital
until
he
had
sent
word
before
them
that
the
party
intended
to
go
to
uganda
grant
about
this
time
was
laid
up
with
an
ulcerated
leg
and
when
the
time
came
for
moving
forward
speke
was
obliged
to
set
out
for
uganda
alone
which
place
he
entered
on
january
he
became
a
close
friend
of
the
royal
family
and
the
chief
men
and
his
beard
was
a
constant
source
of
admiration
and
conversation
the
illness
of
grant
prevented
him
from
joining
the
party
at
uganda
till
the
end
of
may
and
on
july
of
the
same
year
after
many
delays
they
obtained
leave
from
the
king
to
leave
uganda
by
july
the
speke
had
reached
the
ripon
falls
where
the
victoria
nyanza
branch
of
the
nile
flows
out
of
the
great
lake
at
the
head
of
napoleon
gulf
these
falls
were
called
after
the
marquis
of
ripon
who
was
then
the
president
of
the
royal
geographical
society
at
this
time
grant
still
convalescent
was
moving
by
a
more
direct
route
towards
ungaro
speke
met
him
again
on
the
way
thither
and
they
finished
their
journey
together
after
suffering
vexatious
impositions
from
the
monarch
speke
asked
leave
to
go
and
visit
a
new
lake
which
the
natives
called
lutanzige
but
was
refused
permission
he
then
sent
bombay
his
servant
and
interlocutor
along
the
course
of
the
nile
towards
the
outposts
of
pethrick
the
messenger
returned
with
hopeful
news
that
there
was
a
clear
course
open
to
them
in
that
direction
the
whole
party
then
journeyed
down
the
kafu
river
to
the
point
where
it
enters
the
nile
on
the
way
thither
they
came
to
the
karuma
falls
and
were
obliged
to
march
across
swampy
ground
finally
they
met
a
sudanese
black
named
who
was
dressed
like
an
egyptian
and
who
spoke
arabic
muhammed
first
of
all
told
them
that
he
had
come
from
pethrick
but
it
was
later
discovered
that
he
was
in
the
employment
of
doctor
bono
a
trader
from
malta
the
sudanese
was
not
anxious
that
the
party
should
proceed
and
told
them
stories
about
the
impossibility
of
ascending
the
river
at
that
time
during
the
month
of
december
it
was
difficult
to
dissuade
speke
however
and
on
january
he
set
out
for
a
place
which
is
now
called
affudu
there
the
party
paused
for
awhile
in
order
to
kill
enough
game
to
feed
the
native
servants
on
the
of
february
having
forced
some
of
the
natives
into
their
service
as
porters
they
descended
the
nile
to
its
confluence
with
the
asua
river
they
next
crossed
this
river
and
proceeded
onwards
to
the
nile
rapids
and
from
thence
skirted
the
borders
of
the
bari
country
on
february
they
made
an
entrance
into
gondokoro
where
the
whole
party
was
filled
with
joy
to
meet
sir
samuel
baker
who
had
arrived
there
on
the
way
out
to
relieve
them
they
all
advanced
together
to
khartum
after
which
speke
and
grant
returned
to
england
in
the
spring
of
thus
was
the
task
of
the
discovery
of
the
sources
of
the
nile
which
had
baffled
the
seekers
for
many
centuries
at
length
completed
speke
was
received
by
the
prince
of
wales
king
edward
vii
but
the
satisfaction
of
being
allowed
to
place
an
additional
motto
on
his
was
the
only
recognition
which
he
received
for
his
services
as
a
result
of
discoveries
the
victoria
nyanza
took
its
place
on
the
maps
of
africa
and
a
fair
conception
had
been
obtained
of
the
size
and
shape
of
lake
albert
nyanza
illustration
the
ferry
at
old
cairo
the
whole
course
of
the
white
nile
was
also
revealed
with
more
or
less
accuracy
and
all
the
mysterious
surmises
as
to
the
great
flow
of
the
nile
from
some
unknown
headwaters
of
enormous
extent
were
now
solved
it
was
only
necessary
to
fill
in
the
details
of
the
map
in
regard
to
the
great
lakes
and
the
rivers
which
flowed
into
them
and
further
to
investigate
the
extensive
territory
between
the
lakes
and
the
egyptian
settlements
to
the
north
sir
samuel
baker
was
the
man
who
more
than
any
other
helped
to
supply
the
details
of
the
work
already
accomplished
from
cairo
he
started
on
a
journey
up
the
course
of
the
nile
when
he
had
reached
berber
he
chose
the
course
of
the
or
blue
nile
the
branch
which
receives
the
floods
of
water
from
the
abyssinian
he
travelled
up
the
western
frontier
of
abyssinia
proceeding
as
far
as
the
river
rahad
a
river
flowing
into
the
blue
nile
from
the
egyptian
side
from
this
point
baker
turned
backwards
towards
khartum
which
he
reached
in
june
where
he
made
a
stay
of
some
duration
he
now
made
up
his
mind
to
search
for
speke
and
went
up
the
white
nile
as
far
as
gondokoro
where
the
meeting
with
speke
took
place
baker
left
this
place
march
but
met
with
almost
insuperable
obstacles
in
trying
to
make
further
advance
the
porters
deserted
the
camels
died
and
the
ammunition
and
the
presents
intended
to
ease
the
way
through
the
territory
of
native
princes
had
to
be
all
abandoned
thus
disencumbered
his
party
ascended
the
white
nile
until
they
reached
the
victoria
affluent
the
bauyno
tribes
now
prevented
his
intended
advance
to
the
albert
nyanza
baker
however
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
well
received
by
the
chieftain
kamurasi
and
as
he
was
at
this
moment
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
fever
the
friendliness
of
this
central
african
chieftain
was
probably
the
means
of
saving
his
life
the
king
graciously
received
present
of
a
gun
and
then
sent
him
onward
with
two
guides
and
three
hundred
men
the
party
now
managed
to
push
their
way
to
the
shores
of
the
albert
nyanza
they
first
arrived
at
a
place
called
mbakovia
situated
near
the
coast
and
on
march
they
saw
for
the
first
time
the
great
lake
itself
which
they
now
named
the
albert
nyanza
after
a
short
stay
at
mbakovia
they
proceeded
along
the
coast
of
the
lake
until
they
reached
magungo
where
the
victoria
branch
of
the
nile
flows
into
the
albert
nyanza
continuing
the
journey
up
the
source
of
the
victoria
nile
they
discovered
the
murchison
falls
when
they
set
out
for
the
karuma
falls
the
porters
deserted
and
after
many
desperate
adventures
they
at
length
returned
to
khartum
in
may
baker
then
went
on
to
berber
and
crossed
the
desert
to
suakin
on
the
red
sea
he
returned
to
england
late
in
the
year
and
was
received
with
honour
and
decorated
by
the
queen
with
a
knighthood
in
the
year
baker
entered
the
service
of
the
egyptian
government
and
was
commissioned
by
the
viceroy
to
subdue
the
regions
of
equatorial
africa
and
annex
them
to
the
egyptian
empire
to
succeed
in
this
enterprise
he
waged
many
a
war
with
african
tribes
like
the
boni
on
several
occasions
these
conflicts
had
been
forced
upon
him
on
other
occasions
baker
pasha
was
the
aggressor
owing
to
his
fixed
determination
to
extend
on
all
sides
the
limits
of
the
egyptian
sudan
with
all
the
rulers
however
who
treated
him
well
he
remained
on
terms
of
loyalty
and
friendship
and
in
time
he
inspired
them
with
respect
for
his
fairness
and
liberality
baker
pasha
scattered
the
on
all
sides
and
for
the
time
being
effectually
broke
up
their
power
the
of
the
sudan
were
of
arab
nationality
and
were
in
the
habit
of
advancing
farther
year
by
year
upon
the
villages
of
the
defenceless
africans
and
spreading
their
ravages
into
the
heart
of
africa
they
always
attacked
the
less
warlike
tribes
and
upon
breaking
into
a
negro
settlement
would
carry
off
the
whole
population
except
the
aged
or
sick
the
slaves
were
herded
together
in
vast
numbers
by
help
of
logs
of
wood
sawn
in
two
with
holes
cut
large
enough
to
enclose
the
neck
of
a
slave
and
the
two
sides
of
the
log
afterwards
securely
fastened
again
thereby
yoking
together
a
row
of
these
unfortunate
beings
every
year
out
of
five
hundred
thousand
or
more
slaves
at
least
half
the
number
the
markets
for
the
slaves
were
the
cities
of
the
muhammedans
all
through
north
africa
syria
turkey
and
persia
the
hardships
to
the
slaves
were
for
the
most
part
endured
on
the
long
journey
to
cairo
or
when
the
trade
was
suppressed
there
to
points
north
of
the
sudan
such
as
tripoli
or
certain
ports
on
the
red
sea
those
who
were
hardy
enough
to
reach
the
were
usually
well
treated
by
their
muhammedan
masters
during
the
time
of
baker
administration
while
he
was
pursuing
the
and
establishing
egyptian
outposts
the
whole
course
of
the
nile
from
the
great
lakes
became
well
known
to
the
civilised
world
though
after
this
period
baker
pasha
did
not
make
any
further
voyages
of
discovery
into
unknown
parts
during
the
years
of
and
an
adventurous
dutch
lady
of
fortune
miss
alexandrine
tinné
journeyed
up
the
nile
as
far
as
gondokoro
and
in
she
commenced
to
organise
a
daring
expedition
to
find
the
source
of
the

explore
the
territory
between
the

basin
and
lake

she
started
from

and
ascended
the
as
far
as
the
affluent
she
then
crossed
overland
as
far
as
the
jur
and
kosango
rivers
and
reached
the
mountains
on
the
outlying
districts
of
the
country
here
the
members
of
the
expedition
suffered
from
fever
and
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
were
they
able
to
return
to
khartum
where
they
arrived
in
july
in
miss
tinné
started
for
lake
chad
from
tripoli
with
the
intention
of
closing
in
upon
the
nile
from
the
eastern
sources
of
the
affluents
of
the

was
waylaid
by
the
fierce

in
the
sixties
georg
schweinfurth
a
native
of
riga
in
the
baltic
provinces
of
russia
set
out
to
explore
nubia
upper
egypt
and
abyssinia
for
botanical
purposes
subsequently
the
royal
academy
of
science
in
berlin
equipped
him
for
an
expedition
to
explore
the
region
of
the
he
entered
the
sudan
by
suakin
on
the
red
sea
and
crossed
the
desert
to
berber
reaching
khartum
on
november
the
following
january
he
set
out
along
the
course
of
the
white
nile
passed
getina
and
examined
the
vegetation
sudd
which
had
drifted
down
from
all
the
affluents
of
the
white
nile
he
prolonged
his
stay
for
three
years
on
the
solely
absorbed
in
scientific
studies
and
unlike
his
predecessors
he
was
unconcerned
with
reforms
and
attempts
to
suppress
the
schweinfurth
penetrated
so
far
into
the
heart
of
africa
that
he
reached
the
congo
basin
and
explored
the
upper
waters
of
the
welle
river
and
on
his
return
to
europe
he
published
a
work
in
called
heart
of
in
this
book
he
tried
to
demonstrate
that
the
area
of
the
victoria
nyanza
was
taken
up
by
a
chain
of
five
lakes
about
this
time
in
the
same
year
the
famous
henry
morton
stanley
returned
to
london
from
his
adventurous
discovery
and
relief
of
david
livingstone
the
distinguished
missionary
and
explorer
died
not
long
afterwards
and
the
fame
of
his
brilliant
discoveries
and
heroic
life
aroused
great
sympathy
and
interest
in
african
exploration
the
great
river
which
livingstone
had
explored
was
believed
by
him
to
have
been
the
nile
but
was
more
correctly
thought
by
others
to
have
been
the
congo
river
on
account
of
the
interest
aroused
in
livingstone
the
york
and
the
of
london
decided
to
send
stanley
on
a
fully
equipped
expedition
to
solve
the
many
problems
relating
to
the
heart
of
africa
about
which
the
civilised
world
was
still
in
the
dark
stanley
chose
the
route
of
zanzibar
and
landing
there
he
went
up
the
course
of
the
river
and
crossed
the
country
to
the
victoria
nyanza
by
the
way
of
unyamwezi
he
reached
the
lake
by
the
end
of
february
on
march
the
he
set
out
to
explore
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
mapped
the
whole
region
including
its
bays
islands
and
archipelagoes
with
a
considerable
amount
of
accuracy
he
also
examined
napoleon
gulf
and
reached
as
far
as
ripon
falls
at
which
point
the
waters
of
the
lake
flow
towards
the
albert
nyanza
he
then
verified
the
accuracy
of
supposition
that
the
victoria
nyanza
really
was
the
main
source
of
the
white
nile
stanley
set
out
from
uganda
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
travelled
across
the
country
to
the
congo
about
the
same
time
three
english
surveyors
colonels
purdy
colston
and
sidney
enser
made
several
topographical
reports
on
much
of
the
territory
between
the
the
shari
and
the
nile
later
on
in
general

of

khédive
to
navigate
and
to
explore

albert
nyanza
in
the
following
year
colonel
mason
an
american
surveyed
the
lake
of
which
he
made
an
accurate
topographical
chart
in
the
year
ravenstein
an
eminent
geographer
made
some
valuable
surveys
of
eastern
equatorial
africa
which
had
the
effect
of
inciting
the
royal
geographical
society
to
send
out
in
an
expedition
under
joseph
thomson
a
brilliant
young
african
explorer
in
order
to
find
out
a
direct
route
to
the
victoria
nyanza
thomson
set
out
from
momhasa
early
in
the
year
but
he
never
succeeded
in
realising
the
purpose
of
his
mission
emin
pasha
as
we
have
seen
was
the
governor
appointed
by
the
khédive
to
rule
the
egyptian
equatorial
provinces
he
made
a
few
discoveries
such
as
the
semliki
river
which
was
called
by
him
divern
whilst
he
was
engaged
in
travelling
through
the
district
the
revolt
of
the
mahdi
occurred
and
emin
pasha
was
isolated
from
the
outer
world
in
the
year
doctor
junker
returned
to
europe
from
emin
and
roused
great
interest
by
his
account
of
the
adventures
of
the
pasha
whom
most
people
had
believed
to
have
died
but
whom
they
now
learned
had
set
up
an
independent
sovereignty
in
the
heart
of
africa
awaiting
anxiously
the
advent
of
a
relief
expedition
then
henry
stanley
volunteered
to
go
out
on
a
relief
expedition
to
bring
emin
pasha
home
stanley
avoided
the
route
through
the
german
colony
on
the
east
and
started
upon
his
ever
memorable
relief
expedition
by
the
congo
route
the
veteran
adventurer
succeeded
in
relieving
emin
pasha
and
furthermore
he
discovered
the
mountains
of
the
moon
called
by
the
natives
ruwenjori
on
may
he
also
traced
to
its
sources
the
semliki

is
a
wonderful
piece
of
sculpture
known
as
the
rosetta
stone
a
glance
at
its
graven
surface
suffices
to
show
that
three
sets
of
inscriptions
are
recorded
there
the
upper
one
occupying
about
of
the
surface
is
a
pictured
scroll
made
up
of
chains
of
those
strange
outlines
of
serpents
hawks
lions
and
so
on
which
are
recognised
even
by
the
least
initiated
as
hieroglyphics
the
middle
inscription
made
up
of
lines
angles
and
one
might
suppose
to
be
a
sort
of
abbreviated
or
shorthand
hieroglyphic
the
third
or
lower
inscription
is
manifestly
greek
obviously
a
thing
of
words
if
the
screeds
above
be
also
made
of
words
only
the
elect
have
any
way
of
proving
the
fact
fortunately
however
even
the
least
scholarly
observer
is
left
in
no
doubt
as
to
the
real
import
of
the
thing
he
sees
for
an
obliging
english
label
tells
us
that
these
three
inscriptions
are
renderings
of
the
same
message
and
that
this
message
is
a
of
the
priests
of
memphis
conferring
divine
honours
on
ptolemy
epiphanes
king
of
egypt
the
label
goes
on
to
state
that
the
upper
transcription
of
which
unfortunately
only
parts
of
the
last
dozen
lines
or
so
remain
the
slab
being
broken
is
in
egyptian
language
in
hieroglyphics
or
writing
of
the
the
second
inscription
in
the
same
language
demotic
or
the
writing
of
the
and
the
third
the
greek
language
and
then
comes
a
brief
biography
of
the
rosetta
stone
itself
as
follows
stone
was
found
by
the
french
in
among
the
ruins
of
fort
julian
near
the
rosetta
mouth
of
the
nile
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
british
by
the
treaty
of
alexandria
and
was
deposited
in
the
british
museum
in
the
year
there
is
a
whole
volume
of
history
in
that
brief
inscription
and
a
bitter
sting
thrown
in
if
the
reader
chance
to
be
a
frenchman
yet
the
facts
involved
could
scarcely
be
suggested
more
modestly
they
are
recorded
much
more
bluntly
in
a
graven
inscription
on
the
side
of
the
stone
which
runs
in
egypt
by
the
british
army
no
frenchman
could
read
those
words
without
a
sinking
of
the
heart
the
value
of
the
rosetta
stone
depended
on
the
fact
that
it
gave
promise
even
when
originally
inspected
of
furnishing
a
key
to
the
mystery
of
the
hieroglyphics
for
two
thousand
years
the
secret
of
these
strange
markings
had
been
forgotten
nowhere
in
the
world
quite
as
little
in
egypt
as
elsewhere
had
any
man
the
slightest
clue
to
their
meaning
there
were
even
those
who
doubted
whether
these
droll
picturings
really
had
any
specific
meaning
questioning
whether
they
were
not
merely
vague
symbols
of
esoteric
religious
import
and
nothing
more
and
it
was
the
rosetta
stone
that
gave
the
answer
to
these
doubters
and
restored
to
the
world
a
lost
language
and
a
forgotten
literature
the
trustees
of
the
british
museum
recognised
that
the
problem
of
the
rosetta
stone
was
one
on
which
the
scientists
of
the
world
might
well
exhaust
their
ingenuity
and
they
promptly
published
a
carefully
lithographed
copy
of
the
entire
inscription
so
that
foreign
scholarship
had
equal
opportunity
with
british
to
try
to
solve
the
riddle
how
difficult
a
riddle
it
was
even
with
this
key
in
hand
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
though
scholars
of
all
nations
brought
their
ingenuity
to
bear
upon
it
nothing
more
was
accomplished
for
a
dozen
years
than
to
give
authority
to
three
or
four
guesses
regarding
the
nature
of
the
upper
inscriptions
which
as
it
afterwards
proved
were
quite
incorrect
and
altogether
misleading
this
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
show
that
ordinary
scholarship
might
have
studied
the
rosetta
stone
till
the
end
of
time
without
getting
far
on
the
track
of
its
secrets
the
key
was
there
but
to
apply
it
required
the
inspired
insight
that
is
to
say
the
shrewd
guessing
power
of
genius
the
man
who
undertook
the
task
had
perhaps
the
keenest
scientific
imagination
and
the
most
versatile
profundity
of
knowledge
of
his
generation
one
is
tempted
to
say
of
any
generation
for
he
was
none
other
than
the
extraordinary
thomas
young
the
demonstrator
of
the
vibratory
nature
of
light
young
had
his
attention
called
to
the
rosetta
stone
by
accident
and
his
usual
rapacity
for
knowledge
at
once
led
him
to
speculate
as
to
the
possible
aid
this
inscription
might
give
in
the
solution
of
egyptian
problems
resolving
at
once
to
attempt
the
solution
himself
he
set
to
work
to
learn
koptic
which
was
rightly
believed
to
represent
the
nearest
existing
approach
to
the
ancient
egyptian
language
his
amazing
facility
in
the
acquisition
of
languages
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
that
within
a
year
of
his
first
efforts
he
had
mastered
koptic
and
assured
himself
that
the
ancient
egyptian
language
was
really
similar
to
it
and
had
even
made
a
tentative
attempt
at
the
translation
of
the
egyptian
scroll
his
results
were
only
tentative
to
be
sure
yet
they
constituted
the
very
beginnings
of
our
knowledge
regarding
the
meaning
of
hieroglyphics
just
how
far
they
carried
has
been
a
subject
of
ardent
controversy
ever
since
not
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
specific
facts
what
is
questioned
is
the
exact
importance
of
these
facts
for
it
is
undeniable
that
young
did
not
complete
and
perfect
the
discovery
and
as
always
in
such
matters
there
is
opportunity
for
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
share
of
credit
due
to
each
of
the
workers
who
entered
into
the
discovery
specific
discoveries
were
these
that
many
of
the
pictures
of
the
hieroglyphics
stand
for
the
names
of
the
objects
actually
delineated
that
other
pictures
are
sometimes
only
symbolic
that
plural
numbers
are
represented
by
repetition
that
numerals
are
represented
by
dashes
that
hieroglyphics
may
read
either
from
the
right
or
from
the
left
but
always
from
the
direction
in
which
the
animals
and
human
figures
face
that
proper
names
are
surrounded
by
a
graven
oval
ring
making
what
he
called
a
cartouche
that
the
cartouches
of
the
preserved
portion
of
the
rosetta
stone
stand
for
the
name
of
ptolemy
alone
that
the
presence
of
a
female
figure
after
such
cartouches
in
other
inscriptions
always
denotes
the
female
sex
that
within
the
cartouches
the
hieroglyphic
symbols
have
a
positively
phonetic
value
either
alphabetic
or
syllabic
and
that
several
different
characters
may
have
the
same
phonetic
value
just
what
these
phonetic
values
are
doctor
young
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
fourteen
characters
representing
nine
sounds
six
of
which
are
accepted
as
correctly
representing
the
letters
to
which
he
ascribed
them
and
the
three
others
as
being
correct
regarding
their
essential
or
consonantal
element
it
is
clear
therefore
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
thus
far
and
on
the
very
verge
of
complete
discovery
but
unfortunately
he
failed
to
take
the
next
step
which
would
have
been
to
realise
that
the
same
phonetic
values
given
the
alphabetic
characters
within
the
cartouches
were
often
ascribed
to
them
also
when
used
in
the
general
text
of
an
inscription
in
other
words
that
the
use
of
an
alphabet
was
not
confined
to
proper
names
this
was
the
great
secret
which
young
missed
but
which
his
french
successor
jean
françois
champollion
working
on
the
foundation
that
young
had
laid
was
enabled
to
ferret
out
illustration
jean
francois
champollion
initial
studies
of
the
rosetta
stone
were
made
in
his
later
publications
bore
date
of
first
announcement
of
results
came
in
his
second
and
more
important
one
in
by
this
time
through
study
of
the
cartouches
of
other
inscriptions
he
had
made
out
almost
the
complete
alphabet
and
the
of
the
was
practically
solved
he
proved
that
the
egyptians
had
developed
a
relatively
complete
alphabet
mostly
neglecting
the
vowels
as
early
semitic
alphabets
did
also
centuries
before
the
phoenicians
were
heard
of
in
history
even
this
statement
however
must
in
a
measure
be
modified
these
pictures
are
letters
and
something
more
some
of
them
are
purely
alphabetical
in
character
and
some
are
symbolic
in
another
way
some
characters
represent
syllables
others
stand
sometimes
as
mere
representatives
of
sounds
and
again
in
a
more
extended
sense
as
representatives
of
things
such
as
all
hieroglyphics
doubtless
were
in
the
beginning
in
a
word
this
is
an
alphabet
but
not
a
perfected
alphabet
such
as
modern
nations
generally
use
the
word
is
applied
as
we
have
seen
to
various
forms
of
picture
writing
but
the
original
interpretation
which
the
greeks
who
invented
it
put
upon
the
word
was
the
of
the
egyptians
the
earliest
greek
travellers
who
went
to
egypt
when
that
country
was
finally
opened
up
to
the
outside
world
must
have
noticed
the
strange
picture
scrolls
everywhere
to
be
seen
there
on
the
temple
walls
on
obelisks
on
statues
and
as
well
as
on
papyrus
rolls
which
were
obviously
intended
to
serve
the
purpose
of
handing
down
records
of
events
to
future
generations
it
is
now
known
that
this
writing
of
the
egyptians
was
of
a
most
extraordinary
compound
character
part
of
its
pictures
are
used
as
direct
representations
of
the
objects
presented
here
are
some
examples
illustration
page

again
the
picture
of
an
object
becomes
an
ideograph
as
in
the
following
instances
here
the
sacred
ibis
or
the
sacred
bull
symbolises
the
soul
the
bee
stands
for
honey
the
eyes
for
the
verb
yet
again
these
pictures
may
stand
neither
as
pictures
of
things
nor
as
ideographs
but
as
having
the
phonetic
value
of
a
syllable
such
syllabic
signs
may
be
used
either
singly
as
above
or
in
combination
as
illustrated
below
but
one
other
stage
of
evolution
is
possible
namely
the
use
of
signs
with
a
purely
alphabetical
significance
the
egyptians
made
this
step
also
and
their
strangely
conglomerate
writing
makes
use
of
the
following
alphabet
illustration
page
image
in
a
word
then
the
egyptian
writing
has
passed
through
all
the
stages
of
development
from
the
purely
pictorial
to
the
alphabetical
but
with
this
strange
qualification
that
while
advancing
to
the
later
stages
it
retains
the
use
of
crude
earlier
forms
as
canon
taylor
has
graphically
phrased
it
the
egyptian
writing
is
a
completed
structure
but
one
from
which
the
scaffolding
has
not
been
removed
the
next
step
would
have
been
to
remove
the
now
useless
scaffolding
leaving
a
purely
alphabetical
writing
as
the
completed
structure
looking
at
the
matter
from
the
modern
standpoint
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
so
intelligent
a
people
as
the
egyptians
should
have
failed
to
make
this
advance
yet
the
facts
stand
that
as
early
as
the
time
of
the
pyramid
builders
say
four
thousand
years
the
egyptians
had
made
the
wonderful
analysis
of
sounds
without
which
the
invention
of
an
alphabet
would
be
impossible
the
latest
word
on
the
subject
of
the
origin
of
the
alphabet
takes
back
some
of
the
primitive
phonetic
signs
to
prehistoric
times
among
these
prehistoric
signs
are
the
letters
a
e
i
o
u
v
f
and
they
had
set
aside
certain
of
their
hieroglyphic
symbols
and
given
them
alphabetical
significance
they
had
learned
to
write
their
words
with
the
use
of
this
alphabet
and
it
would
seem
as
if
in
the
course
of
a
few
generations
they
must
come
to
see
how
unnecessary
was
the
cruder
form
of
which
this
alphabet
would
naturally
supplant
but
in
point
of
fact
they
never
did
come
to
a
realisation
of
this
seemingly
simple
proposition
generation
after
generation
and
century
after
century
they
continued
to
use
their
same
cumbersome
complex
writing
and
it
remained
for
an
outside
nation
to
prove
that
an
alphabet
pure
and
simple
was
capable
of
fulfilling
all
the
conditions
of
a
written
language
thus
in
practice
there
are
found
in
the
hieroglyphics
the
strangest
combinations
of
ideographs
syllabic
signs
and
alphabetical
signs
or
true
letters
used
together
indiscriminately
it
was
for
example
not
at
all
unusual
after
spelling
a
word
syllabically
or
alphabetically
to
introduce
a
figure
giving
the
idea
of
the
thing
intended
and
then
even
to
supplement
this
with
a
determinative
sign
or
figure
illustration
determinative
signs
here
queften
monkey
is
spelled
out
in
full
but
the
picture
of
a
monkey
is
added
as
a
determinative
second
qenu
cavalry
after
being
spelled
is
made
unequivocal
by
the
introduction
of
a
picture
of
a
horse

elaborately
has
pictures
of
wings
added
and
fourth
tatu
quadrupeds
after
being
spelled
has
a
picture
of
a
quadruped
and
then
the
picture
of
a
hide
which
is
the
usual
determinative
of
a
quadruped
followed
by
three
dashes
to
indicate
the
plural
number
another
illustration
of
the
plural
number
is
seen
in
the
sign
pau
on
page
where
the
plural
is
indicated
in
the
same
manner
these
determinatives
are
in
themselves
so
interesting
as
illustrations
of
the
association
of
ideas
that
it
is
worth
while
to
add
a
few
more
examples
the
word
pet
which
signifies
heaven
and
which
has
also
the
meaning
up
or
even
is
represented
primarily
by
what
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
conventionalised
picture
of
the
covering
to
the
earth
but
this
picture
used
as
a
determinative
is
curiously
modified
in
the
expression
of
other
ideas
as
it
symbolises
evening
when
a
closed
flower
is
added
and
night
when
a
star
hangs
in
the
sky
and
rain
or
tempest
when
a
series
of
zigzag
lines
which
by
themselves
represent
water
are
appended
illustration
hieroglyphics
as
aids
to
memory
such
pictures
are
obviously
of
advantage
but
this
advantage
in
the
modern
view
is
outweighed
by
the
cumbrousness
of
the
system
of
writing
as
a
whole
why
was
such
a
complex
system
retained
chiefly
no
doubt
because
the
egyptians
like
all
other
highly
developed
peoples
were
conservatives
they
held
to
their
old
method
after
a
better
one
had
been
invented
but
this
inherent
conservatism
was
enormously
aided
no
doubt
by
the
fact
that
the
egyptian
language
like
the
chinese
has
many
words
that
have
a
varied
significance
making
it
seem
necessary
or
at
least
highly
desirable
either
to
spell
such
words
with
different
signs
or
having
spelled
them
in
the
same
way
to
introduce
the
varied
determinatives
here
are
some
examples
of
discrimination
between
words
of
the
same
sound
by
the
use
of
different
signs
illustration
hieroglyphics
here
it
will
be
observed
exactly
the
same
expedient
is
adopted
which
we
still
retain
when
we
discriminate
between
words
of
the
same
sound
by
different
spelling
as
to
two
too
whole
hole
through
threw
etc
but
the
more
usual
egyptian
method
was
to
resort
to
the
determinatives
the
result
seems
to
us
most
extraordinary
after
what
has
been
said
the
following
examples
will
explain
themselves
illustration
hieroglyphics
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
great
mass
of
people
in
egypt
were
never
able
to
write
at
all
had
they
been
accustomed
to
do
so
the
egyptians
would
have
been
a
nation

artists

the
case
stands

remarkable

in
egyptian
paleography
in
what
is
known
as
the
we
reach
signs
which
seem
to
be
disconnected
from
the
known
hieroglyphs
and
we
are
probably
touching
on
the
system
of
geometrical
signs
used
from
prehistoric
to
roman
times
in
egypt
and
also
in
other
countries
around
the
mediterranean
the
information
regarding
the
alphabet
here
given
is
derived
from
the
eighteenth
memoir
of
the
egypt
exploration
fund
how
far
these
signs
are
originally
due
to
geometrical
invention
or
how
far
due
to
corruption
of
some
picture
we
can
not
say
but
in
any
case
they
stood
so
detached
from
the
hieroglyphic
writing
and
its
hieratic
and
demotic
derivations
that
they
must
be
treated
as
a
separate
system
for
the
present
the
best
course
is
to
show
here
the
similarity
of
forms
between
these
marks
and
those
known
in
egypt
in
earlier
and
later
times
adding
the
similar
forms
in
the
karian
and
spanish
alphabets
the
usage
of
such
forms
in
the
same
country
from
about
down
to
or
later
shows
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
definite
system
and
it
seems
impossible
to
separate
that
used
in
in
egypt
from
the
similar
forms
found
in
other
lands
connected
with
egypt
from
down
to
later
times
we
may
find
many
of
these
also
in
the
kretan
inscriptions
long
before
the
only
conclusion
then
seems
to
be
that
a
great
body
of
signs
or
a
was
in
use
around
the
mediterranean
for
several
thousand
years
whether
these
signs
were
ideographic
or
syllabic
or
alphabetic
in
the
early
stages
we
do
not
know
certainly
they
were
alphabetic
in
the
later
stage
and
the
identity
of
most
of
the
signs
in
asia
minor
and
spain
shows
them
to
belong
to
a
system
with
commonly
received
values
in
the
later
times
what
then
becomes
of
the
phoenician
legend
of
the
alphabet
certainly
the
phoenician
letters
were
familiar
long
before
the
rise
of
phoenician
influence
what
is
really
due
to
the
phoenicians
seems
to
have
been
the
selection
of
a
short
series
only
half
the
amount
of
the
surviving
alphabets
for
numerical
purposes
as
a
e
i
n
p
illustration
table
of
comparative
symbols
this
usage
would
soon
render
these
signs
as
invariable
in
order
as
our
own
numbers
and
force
the
use
of
them
on
all
countries
with
which
the
phoenicians
traded
hence
before
long
these
signs
drove
out
of
use
all
others
except
in
the
less
changed
civilisations
of
asia
minor
and
spain
according
to
our
modern
authorities
this
exactly
explains
the
phenomena
of
the
early
greek
alphabets
many
in
variety
and
so
diverse
that
each
has
to
be
learned
separately
and
yet
entirely
uniform
in
order
each
tribe
had
its
own
signs
for
certain
sounds
varying
a
good
deal
yet
all
had
to
follow
a
fixed
numerical
system
certainly
all
did
not
learn
their
forms
from
an
independent
phoenician
alphabet
unknown
to
them
before
it
was
selected
the
work
of
young
and
champollion
says
doctor
williams
gives
a
new
interest
to
the
mass
of
records
in
the
form
of
graven
inscriptions
and
papyrus
rolls
and
cases
and
wrappings
which
abound
in
egypt
but
which
hitherto
had
served
no
better
purpose
for
centuries
than
to
excite
without
satisfying
the
curiosity
of
the
traveller
history
of
the
art
of
writing
portfolio
plate
now
these
strange
records
so
long
enigmatic
could
be
read
and
within
the
past
fifty
years
a
vast
literature
of
translations
of
these
egyptian
records
has
been
given
to
the
world
it
was
early
discovered
that
the
hieroglyphic
character
was
not
reserved
solely
for
sacred
inscriptions
as
the
greeks
had
supposed
in
naming
it
indeed
the
inscription
of
the
rosetta
stone
sufficiently
dispelled
that
illusion
but
no
one
perhaps
was
prepared
for
the
revelations
that
were
soon
made
as
to
the
extent
of
range
of
these
various
inscriptions
and
the
strictly
literary
character
of
some
of
them
a
large
proportion
of
these
inscriptions
are
to
be
sure
religious
in
character
but
there
are
other
extensive
inscriptions
such
as
those
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
karnak
that
are
strictly
historical
telling
of
the
warlike
deeds
of
such
mighty
kings
as
thûtmosis
iii
and
ramses
ii
again
there
are
documents
which
belong
to
the
domain
of
pure
and
simple
of
these
the
best
known
example
is
the
now
famous
of
two
the
prototype
of
the
short
story
up
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
no
egyptologist
had
discovered
that
the
personages
who
lie
in
their
in
our
great
museums
ever
read
or
composed
romance
their
literature
as
far
as
recovered
was
of
an
eminently
serious
nature
hymns
to
the
divinities
epic
poems
writings
on
magic
and
science
business
letters
but
no
stories
in
however
an
englishwoman
elizabeth
sent
de
rougé
at
paris
a
papyrus
she
had
purchased
in
italy
and
whose
contents
she
was
anxious
to
know
thus
was
the
tale
of
the
brought
to
light
and
for
twelve
years
it
remained
our
sole
specimen
of
a
species
of
literature
which
is
now
constantly
being
added
to
this
remarkable
papyrus
dates
from
the
thirteenth
century
and
was
the
work
of
anna
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
his
age
indeed
it
is
to
him
that
we
are
indebted
for
a
large
portion
of
the
egyptian
literature
that
has
been
preserved
to
us
this
particular
work
was
executed
for
seti
son
of
meneptah
and
grandson
of
ramses
ii
of
the
nineteenth
dynasty
while
he
was
yet
crown
prince
the
tale
itself
is
clearly
formed
of
two
parts
the
first
up
to
the
to
the
valley
of
the
cedar
gives
a
really
excellent
picture
of
the
life
and
habits
of
the
peasant
dwelling
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
civilisation
and
moral
conditions
it
describes
are
distinctly
egyptian
were
it
not
for
such
details
as
the
words
spoken
by
the
cows
and
the
miraculous
appearance
of
the
body
of
water
between
the
two
brothers
we
might
say
the
ancient
egyptians
were
strict
realists
in
their
theory
of
fiction
but
the
second
part
leads
us
through
marvels
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
vivid
of
imaginations
it
is
possible
therefore
that
the
tale
as
we
have
it
was
originally
two
separate
stories
the
main
theme
of
the
story
has
occupied
a
great
deal
of
attention
its
analogy
to
the
biblical
narrative
of
joseph
and
wife
comes
at
once
into
the
mind
but
there
is
just
as
close
a
similarity
in
the
greek
tales
where
the
hero
is
killed
or
his
life
endangered
for
having
scorned
the
guilty
love
of
a
woman
as
in
the
stories
of
hippolytus
peleus
bellerophon
and
the
son
of
glaucus
not
to
mention
the
extraordinary
adventure
of
amgiad
and
assad
sons
of
prince
kamaralzaman
in
the
and
one
the
religions
of
greece
and
western
asia
likewise
contain
myths
that
can
be
compared
almost
point
for
point
with
the
tale
of
the
two
brothers
in
phrygia
for
example
atyo
scorns
the
love
of
the
goddess
cybele
as
does
bata
the
love
of
wife
like
bata
again
he
mutilates
himself
and
is
transformed
into
a
pine
instead
of
a
persea
tree
are
we
therefore
to
seek
for
the
common
origin
of
all
the
myths
and
romance
in
the
tragedy
of
anpu
and
bata
that
was
current
we
know
not
how
long
before
the
days
of
king
seti
of
one
thing
we
may
be
sure
of
this
particular
type
the
egyptian
tale
is
by
far
the
oldest
that
we
possess
and
if
we
may
not
look
to
the
valley
of
the
nile
as
the
original
home
of
the
popular
tale
we
may
justly
regard
it
as
the
locality
where
it
was
earliest
naturalised
and
assumed
a
true
literary
form
analogies
to
the
second
part
of
the
tale
are
even
more
numerous
and
curious
they
are
to
be
found
everywhere
in
france
italy
germany
hungary
in
russia
and
all
slavonic
countries
roumania
peloponnesia
in
asia
minor
abyssinia
and
even
india
of
late
years
an
accumulation
of
the
literature
of
every
age
of
egyptian
history
has
either
been
brought
to
light
or
for
the
first
time
studied
from
a
wider
point
of
view
than
was
formerly
possible
in
making
a
few
typical
selections
from
the
mass
of
this
new
material
none
perhaps
are
more
worthy
of
note
than
some
of
the
which
have
been
translated
into
german
from
egyptian
in
liebespoesie
der
alten
ægypten
by
max
muller
this
is
a
very
careful
edition
of
the
on
the
recto
or
upper
surface
of
the
harris
papyrus
and
of
similar
lyrics
from
turin
gizeh
and
paris
the
introduction
contains
an
account
of
egyptian
notions
of
love
and
marriage
gathered
from
hieroglyphic
and
demotic
sources
and
a
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
forms
of
egyptian
verse
its
rhythm
and
accent
the
interesting
of
the
harper
which
is
found
on
the
same
harris
papyrus
is
also
fully
edited
and
collated
with
the
parallel
texts
from
the
theban
tombs
and
compared
with
other
writings
dealing
with
death
from
the
agnostic
point
of
view
the
following
extracts
are
translated
from
the
german
i
will

down
within

for
i
am
sick
with
wrongs

my
neighbours

in
to
visit

with
them
cometh
my
sister
she
will
make
fun
of
the
physicians
she
knoweth

the
lucky
doorkeeper

of
my

her

the

of

as
its
portals

so
oft
as
the

then
is
my
sister
angry
o

but
set
as
the
gatekeeper
i
should
cause
her
to

then
i
should

in

upon

the
most
ardent
interest
that
has
been
manifested
in
the
egyptian
records
had
its
origin
in
the
desire
to
find
evidence
corroborative
of
the
hebrew
accounts
of
the
egyptian
captivity
of
the
jewish
people
the
egyptian
being
at
last
unlocked
it
was
hoped
that
much
new
light
would
be
thrown
on
hebrew
history
but
the
hope
proved
illusive
after
ardent
researches
of
hosts
of
fervid
seekers
for
half
a
century
scarcely
a
word
of
reference
to
the
hebrews
has
been
found
among
the
egyptian
records
the
only
inscription
relating
directly
to
the
israelites
will
be
found
described
in
chapter
vii
if
depicted
at
all
the
hebrew
captives
are
simply
grouped
with
other
subordinate
peoples
not
even
considered
worthy
of
the
dignity
of
names
nor
is
this
strange
when
one
reflects
on
the
subordinate
position
which
the
hebrews
held
in
the
ancient
world
in
historical
as
in
other
matter
much
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
and
a
series
of
events
that
seemed
from
the
hebrew
standpoint
might
very
well
be
thought
too
insignificant
for
record
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
great
nation
like
the
egyptians
but
the
pen
wrought
a
conquest
for
the
hebrews
in
succeeding
generations
that
their
swords
never
achieved
and
thanks
to
their
literature
succeeding
generations
have
cast
historical
perspective
to
the
winds
in
viewing
them
indeed
such
are
the
strange
mutations
of
time
that
had
any
scribe
of
ancient
egypt
seen
fit
to
scrawl
a
dozen
words
about
the
despised
israelite
captives
and
had
this
monument
been
preserved
it
would
have
outweighed
in
value
in
the
opinion
of
europe
all
the
historical
records
of
thûtmosis
ramses
and
their
kin
that
have
come
down
to
us
but
seemingly
no
scribe
ever
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
make
such
an
effort
it
has
just
been
noted
that
the
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
are
by
no
means
restricted
to
sacred
subjects
nevertheless
the
most
widely
known
book
of
the
egyptians
was
as
might
be
expected
one
associated
with
the
funeral
rites
that
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
thoughts
of
the
dwellers
by
the
nile
this
is
the
document
known
as
chapters
of
the
by
day
or
as
it
is
more
commonly
interpreted
book
of
the
it
is
a
veritable
book
in
scope
inasmuch
as
the
closely
written
papyrus
roll
on
which
it
is
enscrolled
measures
sometimes
seventy
feet
in
length
it
is
virtually
the
bible
of
the
egyptians
and
as
in
the
case
of
the
sacred
books
of
other
nations
its
exact
origin
is
obscure
the
earliest
known
copy
is
to
be
found
not
on
a
papyrus
roll
but
upon
the
walls
of
the
chamber
of
the
pyramid
at
saqqâra
near
cairo
the
discovery
of
this
particular
recension
of
book
of
the
was
made
by
lepsius
its
date
is
no
one
supposes
however
that
this
date
marks
the
time
of
the
origin
of
book
of
the
on
the
contrary
it
is
held
by
competent
authority
that
the
earliest
chapters
essentially
unmodified
had
been
in
existence
at
least
a
thousand
years
before
this
and
quite
possibly
for
a
much
longer
time
numerous
copies
of
this
work
in
whole
or
in
part
have
been
preserved
either
on
the
walls
of
temples
on
papyrus
rolls
or
upon
the
cases
of
mummies
these
copies
are
of
various
epochs
from
the
fourth
millennium
as
just
mentioned
to
the
late
roman
period
about
the
fourth
century
throughout
this
period
of
about
four
thousand
years
the
essential
character
of
the
book
remained
unchanged
it
is
true
that
no
two
copies
that
have
been
preserved
are
exactly
identical
in
all
their
parts
there
are
various
omissions
and
repetitions
that
seem
to
indicate
that
the
book
was
not
written
by
any
one
person
or
in
any
one
epoch
but
that
it
was
originally
a
set
of
traditions
quite
possibly
handed
down
for
a
long
period
by
word
of
mouth
before
being
put
into
writing
in
this
regard
as
in
many
others
this
sacred
book
of
the
egyptians
is
closely
comparable
to
the
sacred
books
of
other
nations
it
differs
however
in
one
important
regard
from
these
others
in
that
it
was
never
authoritatively
pronounced
upon
and
crystallised
into
a
fixed
unalterable
shape
from
first
to
last
apparently
the
individual
scribe
was
at
liberty
to
omit
such
portions
as
he
chose
and
even
to
modify
somewhat
the
exact
form
of
expression
in
making
a
copy
of
the
sacred
book
even
in
this
regard
however
the
anomaly
is
not
so
great
as
might
at
first
sight
appear
for
it
must
be
recalled
that
even
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
were
not
given
final
and
authoritative
shape
until
a
period
almost
exactly
coeval
with
that
in
which
the
egyptian
of
the
ceased
to
be
used
at
all
a
peculiar
feature
of
book
of
the
dead
and
one
that
gives
it
still
greater
interest
is
the
fact
that
from
an
early
day
it
was
the
custom
to
illustrate
it
with
graphic
pictures
in
colour
in
fact
taken
as
a
whole
book
of
the
gives
a
very
fair
delineation
of
the
progress
of
egyptian
art
from
the
fourth
millennium
to
its
climax
in
the
eighteenth
dynasty
and
throughout
the
period
of
its
decline
and
this
applies
not
merely
to
the
pictures
proper
but
to
the
forms
of
the
hieroglyphic
letters
themselves
for
it
requires
but
the
most
cursory
inspection
to
show
that
these
give
opportunity
for
no
small
artistic
skill
as
to
the
ideas
preserved
in
book
of
the
dead
it
is
sufficient
here
to
note
that
they
deal
largely
with
the
condition
of
the
human
being
after
death
implying
in
the
most
explicit
way
a
firm
and
unwavering
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
egyptian
believed
most
fully
that
by
his
works
a
man
would
be
known
and
judged
after
death
his
religion
was
essentially
a
religion
of
deeds
and
the
code
of
morals
according
to
which
these
deeds
were
adjudged
has
been
said
by
doctor
budge
the
famous
translator
of
book
of
the
dead
to
be
grandest
and
most

the

ancient
record
of
american
interest
in
accompanying
army
of
invasion
in
egypt
was
a
band
of
savants
representative
of
every
art
and
science
through
whom
the
conqueror
hoped
to
make
known
the
topography
and
antiquities
of
egypt
to
the
european
world
the
result
of
their
researches
was
the
famous
work
called
de
published
under
the
direction
of
the
french
academy
in
volumes
of
text
and
twelve
volumes
of
plates
through
this
magnificent
production
the
western
world
received
its
first
initiation
into
the
mysteries
of
the
wonderful
civilisation
which
had
flourished
so
many
centuries
ago
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
egypt
has
continued
to
yield
an
harvest
of
antiquities
which
owing
to
the
dry
climate
and
the
sand
in
which
they
have
been
buried
are
many
of
them
in
a
marvellous
state
of
preservation
from
the
correlation
of
these
discoveries
the
new
science
of
egyptology
has
sprung
which
has
many
different
branches
relating
either
to
hieroglyphics
chronology
or
archaeology
proper
the
earliest
and
most
helpful
of
all
the
discoveries
was
that
of
the
famous
rosetta
stone
found
by
a
french
artillery
officer
in
while
soldiers
were
excavating
preparatory
to
erecting
fortifications
at
fort
julien
the
deciphering
of
its
trilingual
inscriptions
was
the
greatest
literary
feat
of
modern
times
in
which
thomas
young
and
champollion
share
almost
equal
honours
jean
françois
champollion
is
perhaps
the
most
famous
of
the
early
students
of
egyptian
hieroglyphs
after
writing
his
hiératique
des
anciens
at
paris
he
produced
in
in
two
volumes
his
du
système
hiéroglyphique
des
anciens
égyptiens
on
which
his
fame
largely
depends
as
he
was
the
first
to
furnish
any
practical
system
of
deciphering
the
symbolic
writing
which
was
to
disclose
to
the
waiting
world
egyptian
history
literature
and
civilisation
champollion
wrote
many
other
works
relating
to
egypt
and
may
truly
be
considered
the
pioneer
of
modern
egyptology
while
much
of
his
work
has
been
superseded
by
more
recent
investigations
he
was
so
imbued
with
the
scientific
spirit
that
he
was
enabled
securely
to
lay
the
foundation
of
all
the
work
which
followed
illustration
the
great
hall
of
abydos
the
distinguished
french
savant
augustus
mariette
began
his
remarkable
excavations
in
egypt
in
the
year
the
series
of
discoveries
inaugurated
by
him
lasted
until
the
year
mariette
made
an
discovery
when
he
unearthed
the
famous
serapeum
which
had
once
been
the
of
the
sacred
bulls
of
memphis
which
the
geographer
strabo
records
had
been
covered
over
by
the
drifting
sands
of
the
desert
even
in
the
days
of
augustus
illustration
propylon
at
denderah
the
serapeum
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sphinx
and
on
account
of
its
great
height
remained
in
part
above
the
ground
and
was
visible
to
all
while
everything
else
in
the
neighbourhood
except
the
great
pyramid
of
khûfûi
was
totally
buried
under
the
sand
mariette
worked
his
way
along
the
passage
between
the
great
sphinx
and
the
other
lesser
sphinxes
which
lay
concealed
in
the
vicinity
and
thus
gradually
came
to
the
opening
of
the
serapeum
in
november
his
labours
were
crowned
with
brilliant
success
he
discovered
tombs
of
apis
dating
from
the
eighteenth
dynasty
until
as
late
as
the
reign
of
cleopatra
he
likewise
found
here
many
figures
images
ancient
egyptian
ornaments
and
amulets
and
memorial
stones
erected
by
the
devout
worshippers
of
antiquity
fortunately
for
egyptian
archæology
and
history
nearly
all
the
monuments
here
discovered
were
dated
and
were
thus
of
the
highest
value
in
settling
the
dates
of
dynasties
and
of
the
reigns
of
individual
monarchs
mariette
afterwards
discovered
a
splendid
temple
in
the
same
place
which
he
proved
to
have
been
the
famous
shrine
of
the
god
he
was
soon
appointed
by
the
egyptian
viceroy
said
pasha
as
director
of
the
new
museum
of
antiquities
which
was
then
placed
at
bulak
in
the
vicinity
of
cairo
awaiting
the
completion
of
a
more
substantial
building
at
gizeh
he
obtained
permission
to
make
researches
in
every
part
of
egypt
and
with
varying
success
he
excavated
in
as
many
as
localities
in
some
of
the
researches
undertaken
by
his
direction
it
is
to
be
feared
that
many
invaluable
relics
of
antiquity
may
have
been
destroyed
through
the
carelessness
of
the
workmen
this
is
to
be
accounted
for
from
the
fact
that
mariette
was
not
always
able
to
be
present
and
the
workmen
naturally
had
no
personal
interest
in
preserving
every
relic
and
fragment
from
the
past
it
is
also
to
be
regretted
that
he
left
no
full
account
of
the
work
which
he
undertook
and
for
this
reason
much
of
it
had
to
be
gone
over
again
by
more
modern
explorers
in
the
delta
excavations
were
made
at
sais
bubastis
and
elsewhere
mariette
also
discovered
the
temple
of
tanis
and
many
curious
sphinxes
which
probably
belong
to
the
twelfth
dynasty
and
represent
its
kings
he
further
continued
the
labours
of
lepsius
about
the
necropolis
of
memphis
and
saqqâra
here
several
hundred
tombs
were
discovered
with
the
many
inscriptions
and
figures
which
these
contained
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
findings
a
superb
example
of
egyptian
art
is
the
statue
called
by
the
arabs
village
chief
which
is
now
in
the
museum
at
bulak
mariette
followed
out
his
researches
on
the
site
of
the
sacred
city
of
abydos
here
he
discovered
the
temple
of
seti
of
the
nineteenth
dynasty

mariette
discovered
eight
hundred
tombs
belonging
for
the
most
part
to
the
middle
kingdom
at
denderah
he
discovered
the
famous
ptolemaic
temple
of
hâthor
the
goddess
of
love
and
his
accounts
of
these
discoveries
make
up
a
large
volume
continuing
his
labours
he
excavated
much
of
the
site
of
ancient
thebes
and
the
temple
of
karnak
and
south
of
thebes
the
temple
of
at
edfu
mariette
found
the
temple
of
horus
built
during
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
whose
roof
formed
the
foundation
of
an
arab
village
after
persevering
excavations
the
whole
magnificent
plan
of
the
temple
stood
uncovered
with
all
its
columns
inscriptions
and
carvings
nearly
intact
in
connection
with
the
architecture
of
the
ancient
egyptian
tombs
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
there
was
a
development
of
architectural
style
in
the
formation
of
egyptian
columns
not
dissimilar
in
its
evolution
to
that
which
is
visible
in
the
case
of
the
greek
and
roman
columns
the
earliest
egyptian
column
appears
to
have
been
of
a
strictly
geometrical
character
this
developed
into
a
column
resembling
the
doric
order
a
second
class
of
egyptian
column
was
based
upon
plant
forms
probably
derived
from
the
practice
of
using
reeds
in
the
construction
of
mud
huts
the
chief
botanical
form
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
that
of
the
lotus
a
more
advanced
type
of
decoration
utilised
the
goddess
hâthor
for
the
support
of
the
superincumbent
weight
and
has
its
analogy
in
the
decadent
caraytides
of
late
roman
times
owing
to
friendship
with
the
viceroy
he
was
able
to
guard
his
right
to
excavate
with
strict
exclusiveness
he
was
accustomed
to
allow
other
scholars
the
right
to
examine
localities
where
he
had
been
the
first
one
to
make
the
researches
but
he
would
not
even
allow
the
famous
egyptologist
also
his
great
friend
heinrich
brugsch
to
make
excavations
in
new
places
after
his
death
conditions
were
somewhat
altered
although
the
general
directorship
of
the
excavations
was
still
given
exclusively
to
frenchmen
the
successors
of
mariette
bey
were
gaston
maspero
grébault
de
morgan
and
victor
laret
but
as
time
went
on
savants
of
other
nationalities
were
allowed
to
explore
with
certain
reservations
maspero
founded
an
archaeological
mission
in
cairo
in
and
placed
at
its
head
in
successive
order
mm
lebebure
grébault
and
bouriant
the
first
of
all
to
translate
complete
egyptian
books
and
entire
inscriptions
was
emanuel
de
rougé
who
exerted
a
great
influence
upon
an
illustrious
galaxy
of
french
savants
who
followed
more
or
less
closely
the
example
set
by
him
among
these
translators
we
may
enumerate
mariette
charles
deveria
pierret
maspero
himself
and
revillout
who
has
proved
himself
to
be
the
greatest
demotic
scholar
of
france
england
is
also
represented
by
scholars
of
note
among
whom
may
be
mentioned
samuel
birch
he
was
a
scholar
of
recognised
profundity
and
also
of
remarkable
versatility
one
of
the
most
important
editorial
tasks
of
doctor
birch
was
a
series
known
as
records
of
the
past
which
consisted
of
translations
from
egyptian
and
records
doctor
birch
himself
contributed
several
volumes
to
this
series
he
had
also
the
added
distinction
of
being
the
first
translator
of
the
egyptian
of
the
another
english
authority
was
sir
gardner
wilkinson
who
wrote
several
important
works
on
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
ancient
egyptians
wilkinson
was
born
in
and
died
in
whoever
would
know
the
egyptian
as
he
was
in
manner
and
custom
should
peruse
the
pages
of
his
egyptian
works
his
account
of
the
ancient
has
been
the
chief
source
of
information
on
the
subject
german
scholars
have
done
especially
valuable
work
in
the
translation
of
texts
from
the
egyptian
temples
and
in
pointing
out
the
relation
between
these
texts
and
historical
events
foremost
among
practical
german
archaeologists
is
karl
richard
lepsius
who
was
born
in
at
naumburg
prussia
and
died
in
at
berlin
in
his
maturer
years
he
had
a
professorship
in
berlin
he
made
excursions
to
egypt
in
an
official
capacity
and
familiarised
himself
at
first
hand
with
the
monuments
and
records
that
were
his
the
letters
of
lepsius
from
egypt
and
nubia
were
more
popular
than
his
other
writings
and
were
translated
into
english
and
widely
read
another
famous
german
who
was
interested
in
the
study
of
egyptology
was
baron
christian
bunsen
from
early
youth
he
showed
the
instincts
of
a
scholar
but
was
prevented
for
many
years
from
leading
a
life
owing
to
his
active
duties
in
the
diplomatic
service
for
prussia
at
rome
and
london
during
the
years
bunsen
brought
out
the
famous
work
called
place
in
universal
history
which
brugsch
deemed
to
have
contributed
more
than
any
other
work
in
popularising
the
subject
of
egyptology
heinrich
carl
brugsch
was
born
at
berlin
in
and
died
there
in
like
bunsen
he
was
a
diplomatist
and
a
scholar
he
entered
the
service
of
the
egyptian
government
and
merited
the
titles
of
bey
and
subsequently
of
pasha
he
became
known
as
one
of
the
foremost
of
egyptologists
and
was
the
greatest
authority
of
his
day
on
egyptian
writing
he
wrote
a
work
of
standard
authority
translated
into
english
under
the
title
of
history
of
egypt
under
the
the
chronology
of
egypt
now
in
use
is
still
based
upon
the
system
created
by
brugsch
which
though
confessedly
artificial
nevertheless
is
able
to
meet
the
difficulties
of
the
subject
better
than
any
other
yet
devised
among
distinguished
german
egyptologists
must
be
mentioned
georg
moritz
ebers
he
is
best
known
by
his
novels
whose
subjects
are
taken
from
the
history
of
ancient
egypt
perhaps
the
most
popular
being
egyptian
besides
these
popular
novels
and
a
valuable
description
of
egypt
ebers
also
made
personal
explorations
in
the
country
and
discovered
at
thebes
the
great
medical
papyrus
which
is
called
the
papyrus
ebers
this
remarkable
document
to
which
he
devoted
so
much
labour
is
our
chief
source
of
information
regarding
the
practice
of
medicine
as
it
existed
and
would
alone
keep
the
name
of
ebers
alive
among
egyptologists
the
leading
german
egyptologist
of
is
adolf
erman
who
was
born
at
berlin
in
he
is
the
worthy
successor
to
brugsch
in
the
chair
of
egyptology
at
the
university
of
berlin
and
is
director
of
the
berlin
egyptian
museum
his
writings
have
had
to
do
mainly
with
grammatical
and
literary
investigations
his
editions
of
the
of
old
are
models
of
scholarly
interpretation
they
give
the
original
hieratic
text
with
translation
into
egyptian
hieroglyphics
into
latin
and
into
german
doctor
erman
has
not
however
confined
his
labours
to
this
strictly
scholarly
type
of
work
but
has
also
written
a
distinctly
popular
book
on
the
life
of
the
ancient
egyptians
which
is
the
most
complete
work
that
has
appeared
since
the
writings
of
wilkinson
the
memorable
speech
of
erman
delivered
on
the
occasion
of
his
election
as
a
member
of
the
berlin
academy
sets
forth
clearly
the
progress
made
in
the
science
of
egyptology
and
tendencies
on
that
occasion
he
said
of
our
older
complain
that
we
of
the
younger
generation
are
depriving
egyptology
of
all
its
charm
and
that
out
of
a
delightful
science
abounding
in
startling
discoveries
we
have
made
a
philological
study
with
strange
phonetic
laws
and
a
wretched
syntax
there
is
doubtless
truth
in
this
complaint
but
it
should
be
urged
against
the
natural
growth
of
the
science
and
not
against
the
personal
influence
of
individuals
or
its
development
the
state
through
which
egyptology
is
now
passing
is
one
from
which
no
science
escapes
it
is
a
reaction
against
the
enthusiasm
and
the
rapid
advance
of
its
early
days
can
well
understand
to
outsiders
it
may
seem
as
though
we
had
only
retrograded
during
later
years
where
are
the
good
old
times
when
every
text
could
be
translated
and
understood
alas
a
better
comprehension
of
the
grammar
has
revealed
on
every
side
difficulties
and
impediments
of
which
hitherto
nothing
had
been
suspected
moreover
the
number
of
ascertained
words
in
the
vocabulary
is
continually
diminishing
while
the
host
of
the
unknown
increases
for
we
no
longer
arrive
at
the
meaning
by
the
way
of
audacious
etymologies
and
still
more
audacious
guesses
have
yet
to
travel
for
many
years
on
the
arduous
path
of
empirical
research
before
we
can
attain
to
an
adequate
dictionary
there
is
indeed
an
exceptional
reward
which
beckons
us
on
to
the
same
goal
namely
that
we
shall
then
be
able
to
assign
to
egyptian
its
place
among
the
languages
of
western
asia
and
of
africa
at
present
we
do
well
to
let
this
great
question
alone
as
in
the
linguistic
department
of
egyptology
so
it
is
in
every
other
section
of
the
subject
the
egyptian
religion
seemed
intelligently
and
systematically
rounded
off
when
each
god
was
held
to
be
the
incarnation
of
some
power
of
nature
now
we
comprehend
that
we
had
better
reserve
our
verdict
on
this
matter
until
we
know
the
facts
and
the
history
of
the
religion
and
how
far
we
are
from
knowing
them
is
proved
to
us
by
every
text
the
texts
are
full
of
allusions
to
the
deeds
and
fortunes
of
the
gods
but
only
a
very
small
number
of
these
allusions
are
intelligible
to
us
time
has
gone
by
in
which
it
was
thought
possible
to
furnish
the
chronology
of
egyptian
history
and
in
which
that
history
was
supposed
to
be
known
because
the
succession
of
the
most
powerful
kings
had
been
ascertained
to
us
the
history
of
egypt
has
become
something
altogether
different
it
comprises
the
history
of
her
civilisation
her
art
and
her
administration
and
we
rejoice
in
the
prospect
that
one
day
it
may
be
possible
in
that
land
to
trace
the
development
of
a
nation
throughout
five
thousand
years
by
means
of
its
own
monuments
and
records
but
we
also
know
that
the
realisation
of
this
dream
must
be
the
work
of
many
generations
texts
which
lead
us
out
of
ancient
egypt
into
the
period
were
deciphered
with
the
acumen
of
genius
more
than
half
a
century
ago
by
heinrich
brugsch
but
these
also
appear
to
us
in
a
new
light
as
being
full
of
unexpected
difficulties
and
in
apparent
disagreement
with
both
the
older
and
the
later
forms
of
the
language
in
this
important
department
we
must
not
shrink
from
a
revision
of
past
work
will
not
further
illustrate
this
theme
but
the
case
is
the
same
in
every
branch
of
egyptology
in
each
the
day
of
rapid
results
is
at
an
end
and
the
monotonous
time
of
special
studies
has
begun
hence
i
would
beg
the
academy
not
to
expect
sensational
discoveries
from
their
new
associate
i
can
only
offer
what
brings
to
light
and
that
is
discoveries
yet
in
the
process
of
time
they
will
lead
us
to
those
very
ends
which
seemed
so
nearly
attainable
to
our
the
german
school
may
perhaps
be
said
to
have
devoted
its
time
especially
to
labours
upon
egyptian
grammar
and
philology
while
the
french
school
is
better
known
for
its
excellent
work
on
the
history
and
archaeology
of
ancient
egypt
on
these
topics
the
leading
authority
among
all
the
scholars
of
is
the
eminent
frenchman
professor
gaston
maspero
author
of
the
first
nine
volumes
of
the
present
work
he
was
born
at
paris
june
he
is
a
member
of
the
french
institute
and
was
formerly
professor
of
egyptian
archeology
and
ethnology
in
the
collège
de
france
and
more
recently
director
of
the
egyptian
museum
at
bulak
his
writings
cover
the
entire
field
of
oriental
antiquity
in
this
field
maspero
has
no
peer
among
egyptologists
of
the
present
or
the
past
he
possesses
an
eminent
gift
of
style
and
his
works
afford
a
rare
combination
of
the
qualities
of
authority
scientific
accuracy
and
of
popular
readableness
some
extraordinary
treasures
from
tombs
were
discovered
in
the
year
at
that
date
arabs
often
hawked
about
in
the
streets
what
purported
to
be
genuine
works
of
antiquity
many
of
these
were
in
reality
imitations
but
professor
maspero
in
this
year
secured
from
an
arab
a
funeral
papyrus
of
phtahhotpû
and
after
considerable
trouble
he
was
able
to
locate
the
tomb
in
thebes
from
which
the
treasure
had
been
taken
brugsch
now
excavated
the
cave
which
was
found
to
be
the
place
where
a
quantity
of
valuable
treasures
had
been
secreted
probably
at
the
time
of
the
sacking
of
thebes
by
the
assyrians
six
thousand
objects
were
secured
and
they
included
mummies
of
kings
queens
princes
and
high
priests
and
five
papyri
among
which
was
the
funeral
papyrus
of
queen
makeru
of
the
twentieth
dynasty
the
had
been
opened
by
the
arabs
who
had
taken
out
the
mummies
and
in
some
instances
replaced
the
wrong
ones
many
mummies
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
dynasties
had
been
removed
to
this
cave
probably
for
safety
on
account
of
its
secrecy
out
of
the
mummies
found
here
seven
were
of
kings
nine
of
queens
and
princesses
and
several
more
of
persons
of
distinction
the
place
of
concealment
was
situated
at
a
turn
of
a
cliff

managed
successfully
to
identify

king
phtahhotpû
and

in
the
year
the
egypt
exploration
fund
was
founded
for
the
purpose
of
accurate
historical
investigation
in
egypt
the
first
work
undertaken
was
on
a
mound
called
the
in
the
this
place
was
discovered
to
be
the
site
of
the
ancient
pithom
a
supposed
to
have
been
built
by
the
israelites
for
pharaoh
in
the
greek
and
roman
period
the
same
place
had
been
called
hereopolis
naville
also
discovered
succoth
the
first
of
the
israelites
while
fleeing
from
their
oppressor
and
an
inscription
with
the
word
which
he
judged
to
be
the
pihahiroth
of
the
book
of
exodus
the
next
season
the
site
of
zoan
of
the
bible
was
explored
a
village
now
termed
san
professor
flinders
petrie
started
work
where
a
rim
of
red
granite
stood
up
upon
one
of
the
many
mounds
in
the
neighbourhood
the
site
of
the
ancient
city
had
been
here
and
the
granite
rim
was
on
the
site
of
a
temple
the
latter
had
two
enclosure
walls
one
of
which
had
been
built
of
bricks
and
was
of
extreme
antiquity
the
other
was
built
of
bricks
of
eight
times
the
size
and
weight
of
modern
bricks
and
the
wall
was
of
very
great
strength
had
been
built
in
the
locality
and
coins
and
potsherds
discovered
these
remains
professor
petrie
found
to
belong
to
periods
between
the
sixth
and
dynasties
stones
were
found
in
the
vicinity
with
the
cartouche
of
king
papi
from
one
of
the
earliest
dynasties
there
were
also
red
granite
statues
of
ahmenemhâît
and
a
black
granite
statue
of
kind
usirtasen
and
of
king
ahmenemhâît
and
a
torso
of
king
usirtasen
ii
was
found
cut
from
stone
together
with
a
vast
number
of
relics
of
other
monarchs
parts
of
a
giant
statue
of
king
ramses
ii
were
discovered
which
must
have
been
feet
in
height
before
it
was
broken
the
great
toe
alone
measuring
eighteen
inches
across
and
the
weight
of
the
statue
estimated
to
be
about
tons
in
addition
to
these
relics
of
ancient
monarchs
a
large
number
of
antiquities
were
discovered
with
remains
of
objects
for
domestic
use
in
ancient
egyptian
society
the
explorations
conducted
at
tanis
during
brought
to
light
objects
mainly
of
the
ptolemaic
period
because
a
lower
level
had
not
at
that
period
been
reached
but
here
many
invaluable
relics
of
ptolemaic
arts
were
unearthed
the
results
of
researches
were
published
at
this
date
bearing
upon
the
great
pyramid
accurate
measurements
had
been
undertaken
by
professor
petrie
who
was
able
to
prove
that
during
one
epoch
systematic
but
unavailing
efforts
had
been
made
to
destroy
these
great
structures
professor
maspero
discovered
among
the
hills
of
thebes
an
important
tomb
of
the
eleventh
dynasty
which
threw
light
upon
obscure
portions
of
egyptian
history
and
contained
texts
of
the
of
the
the
following
year
he
discovered
the
necropolis
of
khemnis
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kekhrneen
a
provincial
town
in
upper
egypt
built
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
panopolis
the
remains
were
all
in
a
state
of
perfect
preservation
in
july
professor
maspero
secured
permission
from
the
egyptian
government
to
buy
from
the
natives
the
property
which
they
held
on
the
site
of
the
great
temple
at
luxor
and
to
prevent
any
further
work
of
destruction
these
orders
however
were
not
carried
out
till
early
in
when
maspero
began
excavating
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
workmen
he
first
unearthed
the
sanctuary
of
amenhôthes
with
its
massive
roof
he
brought
to
light
the
great
central
colonnade
and
discovered
a
portico
of
ramses
and
many
colossi
which
were
either
still
erect
or
else
had
fallen
on
the
ground
the
columns
of
amenhôthes
iii
were
next
explored
which
were
found
to
be
among
the
most
beautiful
of
all
specimens
of
egyptian
architecture
it
is
believed
that
luxor
will
prove
to
have
been
a
locality
of
almost
as
great
a
beauty
as
karnak
during
the
season
of
professor
petrie
started
excavations
at
the
modern
nehireh
which
he
learned
was
the
site
of
the
ancient
naucratis
here
many
greek
inscriptions
were
found
the
investigations
on
this
site
were
continued
in
the
season
of
illustration
ruins
at
luxor
this
city
was
one
of
great
importance
and
a
commercial
mart
during
the
reign
of
ahmosis
although
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
commodus
it
had
wholly
disappeared
two
temples
of
apollo
were
discovered
one
of
which
was
built
from
limestone
in
the
seventh
century
and
the
other
was
of
white
marble
beautifully
decorated
and
dating
from
the
fifth
century
magnificent
libation
bowls
were
also
discovered
here
some
of
which
had
been
dedicated
to
hera
others
to
zeus
and
others
to
aphrodite
the
lines
of
the
ancient
streets
were
traced
and
a
storehouse
or
granary
of
the
ancient
egyptians
was
unearthed
also
many
greek
coins
besides
these
were
discovered
votive
deposits
cups
of
porcelain
alabaster
jugs
limestone
mortars
and
trowels
chisels
knives
and
hoes
much
light
was
thrown
by
these
discoveries
on
the
progress
of
the
ceramic
arts
and
many
links
uniting
the
greek
pottery
with
the
egyptian
pottery
were
here
for
the
first
time
traced
it
was
learned
that
the
greeks
were
the
pupils
of
the
egyptians
but
that
they
idealised
the
work
of
their
masters
and
brought
into
it
freer
conceptions
of
beauty
and
of
proportion
naville
was
engaged
about
this
time
in
controversies
as
to
the
true
site
of
this
ancient
pithom
he
also
made
in
a
search
for
the
site
of
goshen
he
believed
he
had
identified
this
when
he
discovered
at
saft
an
inscription
dedicated
to
the
gods
of
kes
which
naville
identified
with
kesem
the
name
used
in
the
septuagint
for
goshen
others
however
disagree
and
locate
the
site
of
goshen
at
a
place
called
fakoos
twelve
miles
north
of
the
explorations
of
started
under
the
direction
of
professor
flinders
petrie
llewellen
griffith
and
ernest
gardiner
gardiner
set
out
in
the
direction
of
naucratis
and
petrie
and
griffith
proceeded
to
explore
the
site
of
tanis
the
mound
at
which
they
worked
like
many
other
localities
of
modern
and
ancient
egypt
has
been
known
by
a
variety
of
names
it
is
called
tel
farum
or
the
mound
of
the
pharaoh
tel
bedawi
the
mound
of
the
bedouins
and
tel
nebesheh
after
the
name
of
the
village
upon
this
site
there
are
remains
here
of
an
ancient
cemetery
and
of
two
ancient
towns
and
a
temple
the
cemetery
was
found
to
be
unlike
those
of
memphis
thebes
or
abydos
it
contained
many
small
chambers
and
groups
of
chambers
irregularly
placed
about
a
sandy
plain
these
were
built
mostly
of
brick
but
there
were
other
and
larger
ones
built
of
limestone
a
black
granite
altar
of
the
reign
of
ahmenemhait
ii
was
discovered
and
thrones
of
royal
statues
of
the
twelfth
dynasty
here
were
also
found
a
statue
of
harpocrates
a
portion
of
a
statue
of
phtah
with
an
inscription
of
ramses
a
sphinx
and
tombs
of
the
twentieth
century
containing
many
small
relics
of
antiquity
professor
petrie
went
on
from
here
to
the
site
of
tell
defenneh
the
tahpanhes
of
the
bible
called
taphne
in
the
version
of
the
septuagint
this
proved
to
be
the
remains
of
the
earliest
greek
settlement
in
egypt
and
contains
no
remains
from
a
later
period
than
the
dynasty
it
was
here
that
psammeticus
established
a
colony
of
the
carian
and
ionian
mercenaries
by
whose
aid
this
monarch
had
won
the
throne
and
this
greek
city
had
been
built
as
one
out
of
three
fortresses
to
prevent
the
incursions
of
the
arabians
and
syrians
the
city
of
tahpanhes
or
taphne
is
referred
to
in
the
book
of
jeremiah
there
were
found
on
this
site
the
remains
of
a
vast
pile
of
brick
buildings
which
could
be
seen
in
outline
from
a
great
distance
across
the
plains
the
arabs
called
this
kasr
el
bin
el
yahudi
that
is
castle
of
the
this
was
found
to
have
been
a
fort
and
it
contained
a
stele
with
a
record
of
the
garrison
which
had
been
stationed
there
pieces
of
ancient
armour
and
arms
were
also
found
in
the
neighbourhood
there
was
likewise
a
royal
on
this
site
and
all
the
principal
parts
of
the
settlement
were
found
to
have
been
surrounded
by
a
wall
fifty
feet
thick
which
enclosed
an
area
of
three
thousand
feet
in
length
and
one
thousand
in
breadth
the
gate
on
the
north
opened
towards
the
pelusiac
canal
and
the
south
looked
out
upon
the
ancient
military
road
which
led
up
from
egypt
to
syria
pottery
some
exquisitely
wrought
scale
armour
very
light
but
overlapping
six
times
were
unearthed
within
this
enclosure
there
were
also
greek
vases
and
other
greek
remains
dating
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
reign
of
ahmosis
who
had
subsequently
sent
the
greeks
away
and
prevented
them
from
trading
in
egypt
since
this
greek
colony
came
to
an
end
in
the
year
and
as
the
locality
was
no
longer
frequented
by
greek
soldiers
or
merchants
it
is
possible
to
set
an
exact
term
to
the
period
of
greek
art
which
these
antiquities
represent
the
greek
pottery
here
is
so
unlike
that
of
naucratis
and
of
other
places
that
it
seems
to
be
well
ascertained
that
it
must
have
been
all
manufactured
at
defenneh
itself
outside
the
buildings
of
the
kasr
petrie
discovered
a
large
pavement
resting
upon
the
sands
and
this
discovery
was
of
value
in
explaining
a
certain
passage
of
the
chapter
of
jeremiah
translated
from
the
revised
version
as
follows
came
the
word
of
the
lord
to
jeremiah
in
tahpanhes
saying
take
great
stones
in
thine
hand
and
hide
them
in
the
mortar
of
the
which
is
at
the
entry
of
house
in
tahpanhes
in
the
sight
of
the
men
of
judah
johannan
and
the
captains
who
had
gone
to
egypt
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
send
and
take
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
set
his
throne
upon
these
stones
that
i
have
hid
and
he
shall
spread
his
royal
pavilion
over
them
and
he
shall
come
and
smite
the
land
of
an
alternate
reading
for
is
the
pavement
or
square
the
pavement
which
jeremiah
described
was
evidently
the
one
which
petrie
discovered
though
he
was
not
able
at
the
time
to
discover
the
stones
which
according
to
jeremiah
had
been
inserted
in
the
mortar
outside
the
camp
wall
was
further
discovered
the
remains
of
a
large
settlement
strewn
on
all
sides
with
bits
of
pottery
and
jewelry
and
a
great
number
of
weights
during
this
season
maspero
carried
on
researches
at
luxor
and
proceeded
to
excavate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
great
sphinx
there
are
many
egyptian
pictures
which
represent
the
sphinx
in
its
entirety
down
to
the
paws
but
the
lower
parts
had
for
centuries
been
buried
in
the
accumulations
of
sand
which
had
covered
up
all
of
the
ancient
site
it
had
previously
been
supposed
that
the
sphinx
had
been
hewn
out
of
a
solid
mass
of
rock
resembling
an
immense
boulder
professor
excavations
enabled
him
not
only
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
old
egyptian
paintings
of
the
sphinx
but
also
to
show
that
a
vast
amphitheatre
had
been
hewn
out
of
the
rock
round
the
sphinx
which
was
not
therefore
sculptured
from
a
projecting
rock
since
the
upper
rim
of
this
basin
was
about
on
the
same
level
with
the
head
of
the
figure
it
became
evident
that
the
ancient
sculptors
had
cut
the
rock
away
on
all
sides
and
had
subsequently
left
the
sphinx
isolated
as
it
is
at
the
present
day
maspero
dug
down
during
this
season
to
a
depth
of
thirty
yards
in
the
vicinity
professor
last
official
act
as
of
the
excavations
and
antiquities
of
egypt
was
his
examination
of
the
mummy
of
ramses
ii
found
in
in
the
presence
of
the
khédive
and
other
high
dignitaries
the
mummy
of
this
great
conqueror
was
well
preserved
revealing
a
giant
frame
and
a
face
expressive
of
sovereign
majesty
indomitable
will
and
the
pride
of
the
egyptian
king
of
kings
he
then
unbandaged
the
mummy
of
nofritari
wife
of
king
ahmosis
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
beside
which
in
the
same
sarcophagus
had
been
discovered
the
mummy
of
ramses
itt
the
physiognomy
of
this
monarch
is
more
refined
and
intellectual
than
that
of
his
warlike
predecessor
nor
was
his
frame
built
upon
the
same
colossal
plan
the
height
of
the
body
was
less
and
the
shoulders
not
so
wide
in
the
same
season
maspero
also
discovered
an
ancient
egyptian
romance
inscribed
on
limestone
near
the
tomb
of
sinûhît
at
thebes
a
fragment
on
papyrus
had
been
preserved
at
the
berlin
museum
but
the
whole
romance
was
now
decipherable
professor
maspero
resigned
his
office
of
directorship
on
june
and
was
succeeded
in
the
superintendency
of
excavations
and
egyptian
archeology
by
eugene
grébault
in
the
same
month
grébault
started
upon
the
work
of
unbandaging
the
mummy
of
the
theban
king
sekenenra
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
it
was
under
this
monarch
that
a
revolt
against
the
hyksôs
or
shepherd
kings
had
originated
in
the
course
of
which
the
asiatics
were
expelled
from
egypt
the
history
of
this
king
has
always
been
considered
legendary
but
from
the
signs
of
wounds
present
in
the
mummy
it
is
certain
that
he
had
died
in
battle
in
the
same
season
the
mummy
of
seti
was
unbandaged
and
also
that
of
an
anonymous
prince
the
next
season
the
work
of
clearing
away
the
sand
from
around
the
great
sphinx
was
vigorously
prosecuted
by
grébault
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
chest
the
paws
the
altar
and
plateau
were
all
made
visible
flights
of
steps
were
unearthed
and
finally
accurate
measurements
were
taken
of
the
great
figures
the
height
from
the
lowest
of
the
steps
was
found
to
be
one
hundred
feet
and
the
space
between
the
paws
was
found
to
be
feet
long
and
ten
feet
wide
here
there
was
formerly
an
altar
and
a
stele
of
thûtmosis
iv
was
discovered
recording
a
dream
in
which
he
was
ordered
to
clear
away
the
sand
that
even
then
was
gathering
round
the
site
of
the
sphinx
naville
and
llewellen
griffiths
explored
during
the
season
of
the
mound
of
the
mound
of
the
jew
the
site
is
probably
that
on
which
was
once
built
the
city
that
ptolemy
philadelphus
allowed
the
jews
to
construct
the
remains
of
a
statue
of
the
goddess
bast
to
which
there
is
a
reference
in
josephus
was
also
found
here
the
discovery
of
tablets
of
definitely
jewish
origin
make
it
clear
that
the
modern
name
had
been
given
to
the
place
for
some
reason
connected
with
the
colony
thus
proved
to
have
once
been
settled
there
naville
also
made
researches
at
tel
basta
the
site
of
the
bubastis
of
the
greeks
the
pi
beseth
of
the
bible
and
the
pi
bast
of
the
egyptians
which
was
formerly
the
centre
of
worship
of
the
goddess
pasht
and
her
sacred
animal
the
cat
the
whole
plan
of
the
ancient
temple
was
soon
disclosed
the
general
outline
of
which
bears
much
resemblance
to
that
of
the
great
temple
of
san
in
the
division
which
naville
called
the
festival
hall
were
numerous
black
and
red
statues
inscribed
with
the
name
of
ramses
but
many
of
which
were
probably
not
really
erected
by
this
monarch
here
there
was
also
found
a
standing
statue
of
the
governor
of
ethiopia
a
priest
and
priestess
of
the
dynasty
and
many
other
monuments
of
the
greatest
historical
interest
the
hall
itself
was
built
of
red
granite
another
hall
which
naville
called
the
hall
possessed
a
colonnade
of
such
beauty
that
it
would
seem
to
justify
the
statement
of
herodotus
that
the
temple
of
bubastis
was
one
of
the
finest
in
egypt
the
columns
were
either
splendid
red
granite
monoliths
with
or
capitals
or
a
head
of
hâthor
from
which
fell
two
long
locks
these
columns
probably
belonged
to
the
twelfth
dynasty
in
what
naville
called
the
occurs
the
name
nephthorheb
or
nectanebo
of
the
thirtieth
dynasty
the
relics
of
this
remarkable
temple
thus
cover
a
period
from
the
sixth
to
the
thirtieth
dynasties
some
years
during
this
season
professor
petrie
made
important
discoveries
in
relation
to
the
obscure
hyksôs
dominion
in
egypt
many
representations
of
these
shepherd
kings
were
found
and
from
their
physiognomy
it
was
judged
that
they
were
not
semites
but
rather
mongols
or
tatars
who
probably
came
from
the
same
part
of
asia
as
the
mongul
hordes
of
genghis
khan
early
in
excavations
were
resumed
on
the
site
of
the
great
temple
of
bubastis
by
edouard
naville
li
griffiths
and
the
count
the
investigation
again
yielded
the
usual
crop
of
antiquities
that
was
now
always
expected
from
the
exploration
of
the
famous
sites
a
third
hall
was
discovered
which
had
been
built
in
the
time
of
osorkon
of
red
granite
inlaid
with
sculptured
slabs
there
were
also
many
other
monuments
and
remains
of
the
monarchs
together
with
much
valuable
evidence
relating
to
the
rule
of
the
hyksôs
petrie
brought
to
london
many
beautiful
ptolemaic
and
roman
portraits
which
he
had
discovered
in
a
vast
cemetery
near
the
pyramid
which
bears
the
name
of
king
ahmenemhâît
iii
the
portraits
are
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
and
are
invaluable
as
illustrative
of
the
features
manners
and
customs
of
the
greek
and
roman
periods
in
egyptian
history
his
researches
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fayum
at
this
time
commenced
to
bear
fruit
and
many
questions
were
answered
regarding
the
ancient
lake
mceris
it
was
in
this
season
also
that
the
ever
memorable
excavations
conducted
at
were
first
begun
this
place
is
situated
in
upper
egypt
on
the
site
of
the
capital
which
had
been
built
by
ahmenhotpû
iv
here
were
discovered
many
clay
tablets
in
cuneiform
characters
containing
documents
in
the
babylonian
language
these
were
found
in
the
tomb
of
a
royal
scribe
the
list
contained
a
quantity
of
correspondence
from
the
kings
or
rulers
of
palestine
syria
mesopotamia
and
babylonia
to
ahmenhotpû
iii
and
iv
there
were
egyptian
garrisons
in
those
days
in
palestine
and
they
were
accustomed
to
keep
their
royal
masters
well
informed
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
country
among
other
cities
mentioned
are
byblos
smyrna
appo
or
acre
megiddo
and
ashpelon
during
this
season
many
relics
of
early
christian
art
were
discovered
in
many
cases
a
pagan
picture
had
been
in
part
painted
over
and
thus
given
a
christian
significance
two
figures
of
isis
suckling
horus
are
with
slight
alterations
made
to
represent
the
virgin
and
the
child
a
of
george
slaying
the
dragon
was
discovered
which
closely
resembled
that
of
horus
slaying
set
during
the
following
season
of
petrie
resumed
his
excavations
round
the
pyramid
of
hawara
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
site
of
the
famous
labyrinth
work
had
been
begun
here
in
the
season
previous
and
it
was
now
to
be
crowned
with
great
success
all
the
underground
passages
and
secret
chambers
under
the
pyramid
were
examined
and
the
inscriptions
discovered
of
king
ahmenemhâît
iii
prove
that
this
was
without
doubt
the
pyramid
of
the
monarch
of
that
name
it
was
discovered
that
the
romans
had
broken
into
the
recesses
of
these
secret
chambers
and
many
broken
roman
were
unearthed
later
professor
petrie
examined
the
pyramid
of
illahûn
which
stands
at
the
gate
of
the
fayum
it
is
probable
that
this
was
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
locks
which
regulated
the
flow
of
the
nile
into
lake
moris
many
of
the
antiquities
here
discovered
bore
inscriptions
of
king
usirtasen
and
in
the
same
locality
was
discovered
the
site
of
an
early
christian
cemetery
dating
from
the
fifth
or
sixth
centuries
a
few
miles
from
illahûn
the
same
indefatigable
explorer
discovered
the
remains
of
another
town
belonging
to
the
eighteenth
or
nineteenth
dynasties
a
wall
once
surrounded
the
town
and
beyond
the
wall
was
a
necropolis
the
place
is
now
called
tell
gurah
and
the
relics
give
inscriptions
of
thûtmosis
iii
or
tûtankhamon
and
of
horemheb
in
the
same
season
of
miss
amelia
edwards
who
had
been
sent
out
by
the
egypt
exploration
fund
brought
to
a
conclusion
the
excavations
which
had
been
carried
on
for
several
seasons
at
bubastis
it
was
discovered
that
the
temple
itself
dated
back
to
the
reign
of
the
famous
khûfûi
kheops
the
builder
of
the
great
pyramid
since
an
inscription
with
his
name
on
it
was
discovered
together
with
one
inscribed
to
king
khafrî
chephren
the
monuments
discovered
on
this
site
were
for
the
most
part
shipped
to
europe
and
america
the

from
the
ancient
termuther
illustration
the
lotus
flower
nymphaea
lotus
specimens
recovered
from
here
date
from
the
fourth
to
the
dynasties
and
the
relics
from
termuther
are
from
the
last
period
of
the
ptolemies
early
in
professor
petrie
made
his
exhaustive
examination
of
the
pyramid
of
which
he
declared
to
be
the
earliest
of
all
dated
egyptian
pyramids
and
probably
the
oldest
dated
building
in
the
world
its
builder
was
snofrui
of
the
third
dynasty
and
joined
with
it
and
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
was
the
pyramid
temple
built
at
the
same
period
from
forty
to
sixty
feet
of
rubbish
had
accumulated
around
the
buildings
and
had
to
be
removed
the
front
of
the
temple
was
thirty
feet
wide
and
nine
feet
high
and
a
door
was
discovered
at
the
south
end
a
wide
doorway
leads
to
the
open
court
built
on
the
side
of
the
pyramid
in
the
centre
of
the
court
stands
the
altar
of
offerings
where
there
is
also
an
inscribed
obelisk
thirteen
feet
high
the
walls
of
the
temple
are
all
marked
with
of
visitors
who
belonged
to
the
twelfth
and
eighteenth
dynasties
a
statuette
was
found
dedicated
to
the
gods
of
the
town
by
a
woman
the
tombs
at
this
place
had
been
rifled
in
ancient
times
but
many
skeletons
of
people
who
had
been
buried
in
a
crouching
attitude
were
discovered
and
petrie
considered
that
these
belonged
to
a
different
race
from
that
which
was
accustomed
to
bury
the
dead
recumbent
a
quantity
of
pottery
was
also
unearthed
dating
from
the
fourth
century
the
method
by
which
the
plan
of
a
pyramid
was
laid
out
by
the
ancient
egyptians
was
discovered
in
this
excavation
and
the
designs
show
considerable
mechanical
ingenuity
in
their
execution
and
afford
a
perfect
system
for
maintaining
the
symmetry
of
the
building
itself
no
matter
how
uneven
the
ground
on
which
it
was
to
be
built
in
the
spring
of
naville
started
an
excavation
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
heracleopolis
magna
at
a
place
now
named
hanassieh
he
found
here
many
roman
and
koptic
remains
and
further
discovered
the
vestibule
of
an
ancient
egyptian
temple
there
were
six
columns
on
which
ramses
ii
was
represented
as
offering
gifts
the
name
of
menephtah
was
also
noticed
and
the
architraves
above
the
columns
were
seen
to
be
cut
with
cartouches
of
usirtasen
ii
of
the
twelfth
dynasty
this
temple
was
probably
one
of
those
to
the
service
of
which
ramses
ii
donated
some
slaves
as
is
described
in
one
of
the
papyri
of
the
harris
collection
a
stone
was
discovered
by
wilborn
at
luxor
recording
a
period
of
seven
successive
failure
of
the
nile
to
overflow
and
the
efforts
made
by
a
certain
sorcerer
named
chit
net
to
remove
the
calamity
during
the
season
of
professor
petrie
and
quibell
discovered
homes
belonging
to
paleolithic
man
on
a
plateau
four
thousand
feet
above
the
nile
thirty
miles
south
of
thebes
there
are
many
large
and
beautifully
worked
flints
their
great
antiquity
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
they
are
deeply
stained
whereas
in
the
same
locality
there
are
other
flints
of
an
age
of
five
thousand
years
which
show
no
traces
of
stains
close
by
this
site
was
discovered
the
abundant
remains
of
a
hitherto
unknown
race
this
race
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
true
egyptians
although
their
relics
are
invariably
found
with
those
of
the
egyptians
of
the
fourth
twelfth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
dynasties
petrie
declares
these
men
to
have
been
tall
and
powerful
with
strong
features
a
hooked
nose
a
long
pointed
beard
and
brown
wavy
hair
they
were
not
related
to
the
negroes
but
rather
to
the
amorites
or
libyans
the
bodies
in
these
tombs
are
not
mummified
but
are
contracted
though
laid
in
an
opposite
direction
from
those
discovered
at
medum
the
graves
are
open
square
pits
roofed
over
with
beams
of
wood
this
ancient
race
used
forked
for
chasing
the
gazelle
and
their
beautiful
flints
were
found
to
be
like
those
belonging
to
an
excellent
collection
already
existing
in
the
ashmolean
museum
of
oxford
they
also
made
an
abundant
use
of
copper
for
adzes
harpoons
for
spearing
fish
and
needles
for
sewing
garments
they
used
pottery
abundantly
and
its
variety
is
remarkable
no
less
than
the
quality
which
unlike
the
egyptian
was
all
and
never
fashioned
by
aid
of
the
wheel
they
entered
egypt
about
and
were
probably
of
the
white
libyan
race
and
possibly
may
have
been
the
foreigners
who
overthrew
the
old
egyptian
empire
the
discovery
of
the
name
of
in
an
egyptian
inscription
was
in
a
sense
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
event
of
the
year
in
archæology
it
was
first
laid
before
the
public
by
professor
petrie
and
was
treated
by
in
a
communication
to
the
berlin
academy
and
by

the
name
occurs
in
an
inscription
dated
in
the
fifth
year
of
merenptah
the
successor
of
ramses
and
often
supposed
to
be
the
pharaoh
of
the
exodus
it
is
there
written
with
the
determinative
of
a
people
not
of
a
city
or
country
and
reads
in
our
conventional
transliteration
but
in
reality
agrees
very
closely
to
the
hebrew
the

form
no
conclusion
from
these
statements
as
to
the
relation
in
which
the
israelites
stood
to
pharaoh
and
to
egypt
except
that
they
are
represented
as
having
been
powerless
it
is
pretty
clear
however
from
the
context
that
they
were
then
in
palestine
or
at
least
in
syria
steindorff
suggests
that
they
may
have
entered
syria
from
chaldæa
during
the
disturbed
times
in
egypt
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
and
connects
them
with
the
movements
of
the
khabiri
hebrews
mentioned
in
the
tablets
on
the
other
hand
it
is
of
course
possible
as
professor
petrie
points
out
that
this
reference
to
the
israelites
may
have
some
connection
with
the

the

which
two

many

were

a
new
light
is
thrown
upon
some
of
the
departments
of
greek
literature
by
a
papyrus
which
contains
on
one
side
a
prose
mime
in
two
scenes
a
work
of
the
school
of
sophron
having
points
of
resemblance
to
the
fifth
mime
of
herondas
while
on
the
other
side
is
an
amusing
farce
partly
in
prose
partly
in
verse
the
scene
is
laid
on
the
shores
of
the
indian
ocean
and
the
plot
turns
upon
the
rescue
of
a
greek
maiden
from
the
hands
of
barbarians
who
speak
a
language
with
elements
apparently
derived
from
prakrit
this
is
a
peculiarly
interesting
suggestion
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
in
the
british
museum
an
unpublished
fragment
which
for
some
time
was
considered
by
doctor
budge
to
be
a
species
of
egyptian
stenography
but
which
has
also
been
suggested
to
be
in
pehlevi

the

an

on

the
branch
in
in

and
in
both
there
and
at
hibeh
with
the
result
that
a
very
large
collection
of
ptolemaic
papyri
was
obtained
in
the
winter
of
after
finishing
their
work
at
hibeh
they
returned
to
oxyrrhynchos
here
was
found
a
fragment
of
a
collection
of
sayings
of
jesus
similar
in
style
to
the
discovered
at
oxyrrhynchos
in
as
in
that
papyrus
the
separate
sayings
are
introduced
by
the
words
saith
and
are
for
the
most
part
unrecorded
elsewhere
though
some
which
are
found
in
the
gospels
kingdom
of
god
is
within
and
that
are
first
shall
be
last
and
the
last
shall
be
occur
here
in
different
surroundings
six
sayings
are
preserved
unfortunately
in
an
imperfect
condition
but
the
new
papyrus
supplies
more
evidence
concerning
its
origin
than
was
the
case
with
its
predecessor
for
it
contains
an
introductory
paragraph
stating
that
what
follows
consisted
of
words
which
jesus
the
living
lord
to
two
of
his
disciples
and
moreover
one
of
the
uncanonical
sayings
is
already
extant
in
part
the
conclusion
of
it
that
wonders
shall
reign
and
he
that
reigns
shall
rest
being
quoted
by
clement
of
alexandria
from
the
gospel
according
to
the
hebrews
it
is
indeed
possible
that
this
gospel
was
the
source
from
which
all
this
second
series
of
was
derived
or
they
or
some
of
them
may
perhaps
have
been
taken
from
the
gospel
according
to
the
egyptians
to
which
professor
harnack
and
others
have
referred
the
found
in
but
the
discoverers
are
disposed
to
regard
both
series
as
collections
of
sayings
currently
ascribed
to
our
lord
rather
than
as
extracts
from
any
one

for

in

seem
to
increase
with
the
years
of
labour
in
the

of
professor
petrie
and
his
zealous
helpers
began
their
investigation
of
the
royal
tombs
of
the
first
dynasty
at
abydos
commenting
on
this
undertaking
professor
petrie
writes
might
have
seemed
a
fruitless
and
thankless
task
to
work
at
abydos
after
it
had
been
ransacked
by
mariette
and
had
been
for
the
last
four
years
in
the
hands
of
the
mission
amélineau
my
only
reason
was
that
the
extreme
importance
of
results
from
there
led
to
a
wish
to
ascertain
everything
possible
about
the
early
royal
tombs
after
they
were
done
with
by
others
and
to
search
even
for
fragments
of
the
pottery
to
work
at
abydos
had
been
my
aim
for
years
past
but
it
was
only
after
it
was
abandoned
by
the
mission
amélineau
that
at
last
on
my
fourth
application
for
it
i
was
permitted
to
rescue
for
historical
study
the
results
that
are
here
shown
is
more
disheartening
than
being
obliged
to
gather
results
out
of
the
fraction
left
behind
by
past
plunderers
in
these
royal
tombs
there
had
been
not
only
the
plundering
of
the
precious
metals
and
the
larger
valuables
by
the
wreckers
of
early
ages
there
was
after
that
the
systematic
destruction
of
monuments
by
the
vile
fanaticism
of
the
kopts
which
crushed
everything
beautiful
and
everything
noble
that
mere
greed
had
spared
and
worst
of
all
for
history
came
the
active
search
in
the
last
four
years
for
everything
that
could
have
a
value
in
the
eyes
of
purchasers
or
be
sold
for
profit
regardless
of
its
source
a
search
in
which
whatever
was
not
removed
was
deliberately
and
avowedly
destroyed
in
order
to
enhance
the
intended
profits
of
european
speculators
the
results
are
therefore
only
the
remains
which
have
escaped
the
lust
of
gold
the
fury
of
fanaticism
and
the
greed
of
speculators
in
this
ransacked
spot
rich
harvest
of
history
has
come
from
the
site
which
was
said
to
be
exhausted

in
place
of
the
disordered
confusion
of
names
without
any
historical
connection
which
was
all
that
was

from
the
we
now
have
the
complete
sequence
of
kings
from
the
middle
of
the
dynasty
before
mena
to
probably
the
close
of
the
second

and
we
can
trace
in
detail
the
fluctuations
of
art
throughout
these
at
the
time
when

mena
is
the
first
king
on
the
fragmentary
list
of
manetho
and
the
general
accuracy
of
manetho
was
supported
by
the
accounts
of
herodotus
and
other
ancient
writers
for
several
centuries
these
accounts
were
accepted
as
the
basis
of
authentic
history
with
the
rise
of
the
science
of
egyptology
however
search
began
to
be
made
for
some
corroboration
of
the
actual
existence
of
mena
and
this
was
found
in
the
inscriptions
of
a
temple
wall
at
abydos
which
places
mena
at
the
head
of
the
first
dynasty
and
allowing
for
differences
of
language
the
records
of
manetho
relating
to
the
earlier
dynasty
were
established
mena
was
therefore
accepted
as
the
first
king
of
the
first
dynasty
up
to
the
very
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
a
result
of
professor
petrie
recent
investigations
however
he
has
been
enabled
to
carry
back
the
line
of
the
early
kings
for
three
or
four
generations
the
royal
tombs
at
abydos
lie
closely
together
in
a
compact
group
on
a
site
raised
slightly
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
plain
so
that
the
tombs
could
never
be
flooded
each
of
the
royal
tombs
is
a
large
square
pit
lined
with
brickwork
close
around
it
on
its
own
level
or
higher
up
there
are
generally
small
chambers
in
rows
in
which
were
buried
the
domestics
of
the
king
each
reign
adopted
some
variety
in
the
mode
of
burial
but
they
all
follow
the
type
of
the
prehistoric
burials
more
or
less
developed
the
plain
square
pit
like
those
in
which
the
predynastic
people
were
buried

the
tomb
it
is
surrounded
in
the
earlier
examples

zer

the
careful
manner

were
supervised
under

first

enables
the
modern
egyptologist
by
a
skilful
piecing
together
of
evidence
to
reconstruct
an
almost
perfect
picture
of
the
life
of
egypt
at
the
dawn
of
civilisation
one
of
our
most
valuable
sources
of
information
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
building
the
walls
of
the
royal
tombs
there
were
deposited
in
certain
parts
within
the
walls
objects
now
technically
known
as
we
do
not
know
whether
in
selecting
these
objects
the
ancient
egyptian
had
regard
to
what
he
considered
their
intrinsic
value
or
whether
as
was
most
probable
it
was
some
religious
motive
that
prompted
his
action
often
the
objects
thus
deposited
come
under
the
designation
of
pottery
although
the
vases
were
sometimes
shaped
of
stone
and
not
of
clay
within
such
vases
all
kinds
of
objects
were
preserved
the
jar
or
vase
was
closed
with
a
lump
of
clay
either
flat
or
conical
and
the
clay
was
impressed
while
wet
with
a
seal
a
detailed
and
elaborate
examination
of
the
relative
positions
of
the
tombs
their
dimensions
and
the
objects
found
in
them
compared
with
the
various
fragments
of
historical
records
of
the
early
dynasties
enables
us
to
reconstruct
the
exact
order
of
these
ancient
rulers
this
sequence
is

ka
and
zeser
were
possibly
brothers

following

computed
by

the
dates
of
some
of
these
kings
are
illustration

thus
we
have
reconstructed
the
list
of
thinite
kings
before
mena
so
far
as
the
facts
allow
and
perhaps
so
far
as
we
are
ever
likely
to
ascertain
them
the
facts
about
the
second
dynasty
the
kings
after
qa
must
now
be
studied
in
the
tomb
of
perabsen
it
was
found
that
there
were
buried
with
him
vases
of
three
other
kings
which
are
therefore
his
predecessors
their
names
are
hotepahaui
raneb
and
neteren
and
it
is
certain
that
raneb
preceded
neteren
as
the
latter
had
defaced
and
a
vase
of
the
former
as
on
statue
no
cairo
museum
these
three
names
are
in
the
above
order
and
as
the
succession
of
two
of
them
is
now
proved
it
is
only
reasonable
to
accept
them
in
this
order
from
all
the
available
facts
it
seems
that
we
ought
to
restore
the
dynasty
thus

the
oldest
tomb
that
we
can
definitely
assign
is
that

the
tomb
of

is
a
pit

the

the

with
the

which
filled
it
largely
consisted
of
cylinder
jars
like
the
later
prehistoric
form
and
these
had
many
inscriptions
on
them
written
in
ink
with
a
brush
most
of
which
showed
the
name
of
ka
in
the
usual
panelled
frame
there
can
therefore
be
no
doubt
of
the
attribution
of
this
tomb
the
tomb
b
is
perhaps
that
of
king
zeser
who
seems
to
have
been
a
successor
of
ka
it
is
of
the
same
construction
as
that
of
ka
the
tomb
b
appears
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
great
tombs
by
its
easternmost
position
and
the
objects
of
narmer
point
to
this
as
his
tomb
in
both
the
thickness
and
the
batter
of
the
walls
there
is
a
care
shown
in
proportioning
the
strength
of
the
ends
and
the
sides
the
tomb
b
is
probably
that
of
king
sma
its
walls
are
not
quite
so
thick
being
fifty
inches
at
the
end
the
in
the
floor
suggest
that
there
were
five
on
the
long
side
and
one
in
the
middle
of
each
end
as
in
the
tomb
of
narmer
but
along
the
sides
are
holes
for
roofing
beams
near
the
top
of
the
wall
these
roof
beams
do
not
at
all
accord
with
the
posts
and
this
proves
that
here
at
least
the
posts
were
for
backing
a
wooden
chamber
inside
the
brick
chamber
if
this
be
the
case
here
it
was
probably
also
true
in
tomb
and
hence
these
brick
tombs
were
only
the
protective
shell
around
a
wooden
chamber
which
contained
the
burial
this
same
system
is
known
in
the
first
dynasty
tombs
and
we
see
here
the
source
of
the
chambered
tombs
of
zer
and
zet
before
the
age
of
mena
the
space
around
the
wood
chamber
was
used
for
dropping
in
offerings
between
the
framing
posts
and
then
after
mena
separate
brick
chambers
were
made
around
the
wooden
chamber
in

while
the

notable
that

that
we
have
to
study
here
and
not
its

the

chamber
has
been
built
of
wood

the
brick
cells
around
it
were
built
subsequently
against
the
wooden
chamber

show

the
cast

a

three
narrow

parallel

and
a
short
cross

all
probably
the
places
of

which
supported

besides
these
there
was
till
recently
a
great
mass
of
carbonised
wood
along
the
north
side
of
the
floor
this
was
probably
part
of
the
flooring
of
the
tomb
which
beneath
the
woodwork
was
covered
with
a
layer
of
bricks
which
lay
on
clean
sand
but
all
the
middle
of
the
tomb
had
been
cleared
to
the
native
marl
for
building
the
osiris
shrine
of
which
some
fragments
of
sculpture
in
hard
limestone
are
now
all
that
remain
a
strange
feature
here
is
that
of
the
red
recesses
such
as
were
also
found
in

the
large

are
on
the
west

in

on

no
meaning
can
yet
be
assigned
to
these
except
as
to
the
cells
of

like
the
false

in
spite
of
the
plundering
of
the
tombs
in
various
ages
the
work
of

fund
was
so
thorough
that
not
a
few
gold
objects
have
been
found
in
the
course
of
recent
excavations
by
far
the
most
important
discovery
of
recent
years
was
that
of
some
jewelry
in
the
tomb
of
king
zer
the
story
of
this
find
is
so
entertaining
and
illustrates
so
admirably
the
method
of
the
modern
scientific
explorer
that
we
give
the
account
of
it
in
professor
own
words
my
workmen
were
clearing
the
tomb
they
noticed
among
the
rubbish
which
they
were
moving
a
piece
of
the
arm
of
a
mummy
in
its
wrappings
it
lay
in
a
broken
hole
in
the
north
wall
of
the
tomb
the
party
of
four
who
found
it
looked
into
the
end
of
the
wrappings
and
saw
a
large
gold
bead
the
rosette
in
the
second
bracelet
they
did
not
yield
to
the
natural
wish
to
search
further
or
to
remove
it
but
laid
the
arm
down
where
found
it
until
mace
should
come
and
verify
it
nothing
but
obtaining
the
complete
confidence
of
the
workmen
and
paying
them
for
all
they
find
could
ever
make
them
deal
with
valuables
in
this
careful
manner
on
seeing
it
mace
told
them
to
bring
it
to
our
huts
intact
and
i
received
it
quite
undisturbed
in
the
evening
the
most
intelligent
of
the
party
was
summoned
as
a
witness
of
the
opening
of
the
wrappings
so
that
there
should
be
no
suspicion
that
i
had
not
dealt
fairly
with
the
men
i
then
cut
open
the
linen
bandages
and
found
to
our
great
surprise
the
four
bracelets
of
gold
and
jewelry
the
verification
of
the
exact
order
of
threading
occupied
an
hour
or
two
working
with
a
magnifier
my
wife
and
mace
assisting
when
recorded
the
gold
was
put
in
the
scales
and
weighed
against
sovereigns
before
the
workman
who
saw
everything
rather
more
than
the
value
of
gold
was
given
to
the
men
and
thus
we
ensured
their
and
honesty

illustration
tomb
of
zet
circa
the
first
question
about
these
great
tombs
is
how
they
were
covered
over
some
have
said
that
such
spaces
could
not
be
roofed
and
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
almost
impossible
but
the
actual
beams
found
yet
remaining
in
the
tombs
are
as
long
as
the
widths
of
the
tombs
and
therefore
timber
of
such
sizes
could
be
procured
in
the
tomb
of
qa
the
holes
for
the
beams
yet
remain
in
the
walls
and
even
the
cast
of
the
end
of
a
beam
and
in
the
tombs
of
merneit
azab
and
are
posts
and
pilasters
to
help
in
supporting
a
roof
the
clear
span
of
the
chamber
of
zet
is
inches
or
if
the
beams
were
carried
on
a
wooden
lining
as
seems
likely
it
is
quite
practicable
to
roof
over
these
great
chambers
up
to
spans
of
twenty
feet
the
wood
of
such
lengths
was
actually
used
and
if
spaced
out
over
only
a
quarter
of
the
area
the
beams
would
carry
their
load
with
full
safety
any
boarding
mats
or
straw
laid
over
the
beams
would
not
increase
the
load
that
there
was
a
mass
of
sand
laid
over
the
tomb
is
strongly
shown
by
the
retaining
wall
around
the
top
this
wall
is
roughly
built
and
not
intended
to
be
a
visible
feature
the
outside
is
daubed
with
mud
plaster
and
has
a
considerable
slope
the
inside
is
left
quite
rough
with
bricks
in
and
out
turning
now
to
the
floor
the
basis
of
it
is
mud
plastering
which
was
whitewashed
on
that
were
laid
beams
around
the
sides
and
one
down
the
middle
these
beams
were
placed
before
the
mud
floor
was
hard
and
have
sunk
about
inch
into
it
on
the
beams
a
ledge
was
recessed
and
on
this
ledge
the
edges
of
the
flooring
planks
rested
such
planks
would
not
bend
in
the
middle
by
a
man
standing
on
them
and
therefore
made
a
sound
floor
over
the
planks
was
laid
a
coat
of
mud
plaster
this
construction
doubtless
shows
what
was
the
mode
of
flooring
the
palaces
and
large
houses
of
the
early
egyptians
in
order
to
keep
off
the
damp
of
the
ground
in
the
nile
valley
for
common
houses
a
basis
of
pottery
jars
turned
mouth
down
was
used
for
the
same
purpose
a
very
striking
example
of
this
method
was
unearthed
at
koptos
the
sides
of
the
great
central
chamber
of
zet
are
not
clear
in
arrangement
the
brick
cross
walls
which
subdivide
them
into
separate
cells
have
no
finished
faces
on
their
ends
all
the
wall
faces
are
plastered
and
whitewashed
but
the
ends
of
the
cross
walls
are
rough
bricks
all
irregularly
in
and
out
moreover
the
bricks
project
forward
irregularly
over
the
beam
line
it
seems
then
that
there
was
an
upright
timber
lining
to
the
chamber
against
which
the
cross
walls
were
built
the
walls
thus
having
rough
ends
projecting
over
the
beams
the
footing
of
this
upright
plank
lining
is
indicated
by
a
groove
left
along
the
western
floor
beam
between
the
ledge
on
the
beam
and
the
side
of
the
flooring
planks
thus
we
reach
a
wooden
chamber
lined
with
upright
planks
which
stood
out
from
the
wall
or
from
the
backs
of
the
beams
how
the
side
chambers
were
entered
is
not
shown
whether
there
was
a
door
to
each
or
not
but
as
they
were
intended
to
be
for
ever
closed
and
as
the
chambers
in
two
corners
were
shut
off
by
brickwork
all
round
it
seems
likely
that
all
the
side
chambers
were
equally
closed
and
thus
after
the
slain
domestics
and
offerings
were
deposited
in
them
and
the
king
in
the
centre
hall
the
roof
would
be
permanently
placed
over
the
whole
the
height
of
the
chamber
is
proved
by
the
cast
of
straw
which
formed
part
of
the
roofing
and
which
comes
at
the
top
of
the
course
of
headers
on
edge
which
copes
the
wall
all
around
the
chamber
over
this
straw
there
was
laid
one
course
of
bricks
a
little
recessed
and
beyond
that
is
the
wide
ledge
all
round
before
reaching
the
retaining
wall
the
height
of
the
main
chamber
was
inches
from
the
floor
level
having
examined
the
central
chamber
the
chambers
at
the
sides
should
be
next
considered
the
cross
walls
were
built
after
the
main
brick
outside
was
finished
and
plastered
the
deep
recesses
coloured
red
on
the
north
side
were
built
in
the
construction
where
the
top
is
preserved
entire
as
in
a
side
chamber
on
the
north
it
is
seen
that
the
roofing
of
the
recess
was
upheld
by
building
in
a
board
about
an
inch
thick
the
shallow
recesses
along
the
south
side
were
merely
made
in
the
plastering
and
even
in
the
secondary
plastering
after
the
cross
walls
were
built
all
of
these
recesses
except
that
at
the
were
coloured
due
to
mixing
burnt
ochre
with
the
white
the
tomb
of
merneit
was
not
at
first
suspected
to
exist
as
it
had
no
accumulation
of
pottery
over
it
and
the
whole
ground
had
been
pitted
all
over
by
the
mission
amélineau
making
without
revealing
the
chambers
or
the
plan
as
soon
however
as
petrie
began
systematically
to
clear
the
ground
the
scheme
of
a
large
central
chamber
with
eight
long
chambers
for
offerings
around
it
and
a
line
of
private
tombs
enclosing
it
stood
apparent
the
central
chamber
is
very
accurately
built
with
vertical
sides
parallel
to
less
than
an
inch
it
is
about
feet
wide
and
thirty
feet
long
or
practically
the
same
as
the
chamber
of
zet
around
the
chamber
are
walls
to
inches
thick
and
beyond
them
a
girdle
of
long
narrow
chambers
inches
wide
and
to
inches
long

these

and
no

a
few
yards
distant
from
the
chambers
full
of

is
a
line
of
private
graves
almost
surrounding
the
royal
tomb
this
line
has
an
interruption
at
the
south
end
of
the
west
side
similar
to
the
interruption
of
the
retaining
wall

it

therefore
that
the

approached
it
from
that
direction
the
chamber
of
the
tomb
of
merneit
shows
signs
of
burning
on
both
the
walls
and
the
floor
a
small
piece
of
wood
yet
remaining
indicates
that
it
also
had
a
wooden
floor
like
the
other
tombs
against
the
walls
stand
pilasters
of
brick

although
these
are
not
at
present
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
whole
height
of
the
wall
they
originally
reached
to
the
top
these
pilasters
are
entirely
additions
to
the
first
building
they
stand
against
the
plastering
and
upon
a
loose
layer
of
sand
and
pebbles
about
four
inches
thick
thus
it
is
clear
that
they
belonged
to
the
subsequent
stage
of
the
fitting
of
a
roof
to
the
chamber
the
holes
that
are
shown
in
the
floor
are
apparently
connected
with
the
construction
as
they
are
not
in
the

that

then
roughly
hammered
out

the

the

the
reading

therefore
difficult

the

has
been
closed
with
rough
brick
walling
at
the
top
it
is
curiously
turned
askew
as
if
to
avoid
some
obstacle
but
the
chambers
of
the
tomb
of
den
do
not
come
near
its
direction
after
nine
steps
the
straight
passage
is
reached

then
a
limestone
portcullis

the

moreover
backed
up
by
a
buttress
of

in
five
steps
behind

all
this
shows
that
the
rest
of
the
passage
must
have
been
roofed
in
so
deeply
that
entry
from

was
not
the
obvious
course
the

to
have

timber
sides
some
detail
yet
remains
of
the
wooden
floor
the
roofing
is
distinct
in
this
tomb
and
it
is
evident
that
there
was
an
axial
beam
and
that
the
side
beam
only
went
half
across
the
chamber
this
is
the
only
tomb
with
the
awkward
feature
of
an
axial
doorway
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
beam
was
placed
out
of
the
axis
to
accommodate
it
the
tomb
of
perabsen
shows
a
great
change
in
form
since
the
earlier
series
a
new
dynasty
with
new
ideas
had
succeeded
the
great
founders
of
the
monarchy
the
three
reigns
had
passed
by
before
we
can
again
see
here
the
system
of
the
tombs
even
the
national
worship
was
changed
and
set
had
become
prominent
the
type
of
tomb
which
had
been
developed
under
azab
and
qa
seems
to
have
given
way
to
the
earlier
pattern
of
zer
and
zet
in
this
tomb
of
perabsen
we
see
the
same
row
of
small
cells
separated
by
cross
walls
like
those
of
the
early
kings
but
in
place
of
a
wooden
central
chamber
there
is
a
brick

a
free
passage

left
around
it
communicating
with
the

what
was
the
form
of
the
south
side
of
that
chamber
can
not
now
be
traced
as
if
any
wall
existed
it
is
now
entirely
destroyed
the
entirely
new
feature
is
the
continuous
passage
around
the

perhaps
the
object
of
this
was
to

to
add
to
the

the
greater

built
of
freshly

mud
bricks
which
have
yielded
with
the
pressure
and
flowed
out
sideways
until
the

are
often
double
their
original
breadth
it
was
only
owing
to
this
flow
of
the
walls
over
the
objects
in
the
chambers
that
so
many
valuable
things
were
found
perfect

in

the
most
important

two

these

hence
we
must
figure
to
ourselves
two
great
steles
standing
up

on

east
of
the
tomb
and
this
is
exactly
in

with
the
next
period

we

snofrui

two
great
steles
and
an
altar
between
them

the
east
of

rahotep

two
great
steles

most
interesting
work
at
abydos
was
commenced
in
november
in
the
previous
season
a
part
of
the
early
town
of
abydos
had
been
excavated
and
it
was
found
that
its
period
began
at
the
close
of
the
prehistoric
age
and
extended
over
the
first
few
dynasties
the
connection
between
the
prehistoric
scale
and
historic
reigns
was
thus
settled
the
position
of
this
town
was
close
behind
the
site
of
the
old
temples
of
abydos
and
within
the
great
enclosure
of
the
twelfth
dynasty
which
stands
about
half
a
mile
north
of
the
later
temples
of
seti
and
ramses
ii
this
early
town
being
behind
the
temples
or
more
into
the
sandy
edge
of
the
desert
was
higher
up
the
ground
gently
sloping
from
the
cultivated
land
upward
as
a
sandy
plain
until
it
reaches
the
foot
of
the
hills
a
couple
of
miles
back
the
broad
result
of
these
new
excavations
is
that
ten
different
temples
can
be
traced
on
the
same
ground
though
of
about
twenty
feet
difference
of
level
each
temple
built
on
the
ruins
of
that
which
preceded
it
quite
regardless
of
the
work
of
the
earlier
kings
in
such
a
clearance
it
was
impossible
to
preserve
all
the
structures
had
petrie
and
his
companions
avoided
moving
the
foundations
of
the
dynasty
they
could
never
have
seen
much
of
the
earlier
work
had
they
left
the
paving
of
the
twelfth
dynasty
in
place

must
have
sacrificed

also
had
they
only
worked
the
higher
levels
and
left
the
rest
the
inflow
of
high
nile
would
have
formed
a
pond
which
would
have
so
rotted
the
ground
that
deeper
work
could
not
have
been
carried
on
in
the
future
the
only
course
therefore
was
to
plan
everything
fully
and
remove
whatever
stood
in
the
way
of
more
complete
exploration
all
striking
pieces
of
construction
such
as
the
stone
gateways
of
papi
were
left
untouched
and
work
carried
on
to
deep
levels
around
them
in
this
way
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
site
was
bristling
with
pieces
of
wall
and
blocks
of
stonework
rising
ten
or
fifteen
feet
above
the
low

clearances
as
the
excavations
progressed
there
was
an
incessant
need
of
planning
and
recording
all
the
constructions
professor
petrie
always
went
about
with
a
large
and
a
trowel
in
his
pocket
and
spent
much
time
in
cutting
innumerable
sections
and
tracing
out
the
lines
of
the
bricks
the
top
and
base
level
of
each
piece
of
wall
had
to
be
marked
on
it
and
the
levels
could
then
be
measured
off
to
fixed
points
an
outline
of
some
of
the
principal
buildings
is
given
to

the
general
nature
of
the
site
of

abydos
this
plan
is
not
intended
to
show
all
periods
nor
the
whole
work
of
any
one
age
but
only
a
selection
which
will
avoid
confusion
the
great
outer
wall
on
the
plan
was
probably
first
built
by
usirtasen
the
bricks
of
the
oldest
parts
of
it
are
the
same
size
as
bricks
of
his
foundation
deposits
and
it
rests
upon
town
ruins
of
the
old
kingdom
but
this
wall
has
been
so
often
broken
and
repaired
that
a
complete
study
of
it
would
be
a
heavy
task
some
parts
rest
on
nineteenth
dynasty
building
and
even
roman
patchwork
is
seen
its
general
character
is
shown
with
alternating
portions
the
first
set
consisting
of
towers
of
brickwork
built
in
concave
foundations
and
then
connecting
walls
between
formed
in
straight
courses
the
purpose
of
this
construction
has
long
been
a
puzzle
the
alternate
concave
and
straight
courses
are
the
natural
result
of
building
isolated
masses
on
a
concave
bed
like
all
egyptian
houses
and
then
connecting
them
by
intermediate
walls
the
hard
face
across
the
wall
and
the
joint
to
prevent
the
spread
of
scaling
are
the
essential
advantages
of
this
construction
the

it

it

then
to
begin
with
usirtasen
whose

it
runs
through

to
have
been
kept
up
by
thûtmosis

built
a
wall
with
granite

it

also
by
ramses

the

strangely
shaped
pottery
bowl
similar
in
shape
to
a
stone
bowl
of
the
same
period
but
otherwise
unknown
in
antiquity
this
bowl
may
be
regarded
as
a
freak
of
the
workman
rather
than
as
having
any
particular
value
along
the
line
of
evolution
of
pottery
forms
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
bowls
of
this
form
have
been
quite
recently
made
by
the
modern
english
potters
in
south
devonshire
as
the
result
of
the
inventive
fancy
of
a
village
workman
during
the
course
of
the
excavations
at
abydos
many
thousands
of
fragments
of
pottery
were
collected
illustration
ivory
comb
those
that
appeared
to
be
of
historic
value
were
sorted
and
classified
and
as
a
result
of
minute
and
extended
labours
it
is
now
possible
for
the
reader
to
see
at
a
glance
the
principal
types
of
egyptian
pottery
from
prehistoric
times
and
to
view
their
relationship
as

an
unbroken
series

to
the
chronological
notation
devised
by

some
of

used
by
the
earlier
prehistoric

pottery
marks
a
typical
instance
of
these
pottery
marks
is
shown
in
the
illustration
these
signs
appear
to
be
distinctly
of
the
time
of
and
the
fortified
enclosure
around
the
name
may
refer
to
the
tomb
as
the
eternal
fortress
of
the
king
these
marks
can
be
roughly
classified
into
types
according
to
the
skill
with
which
they
were
drawn
the
first
example
illustrates
the
more
careful
workmanship
and
the
others
show
more
degraded
forms
in
which
the
outline
of
the
hawk
and
the
signs
in
the
cartouche
become
gradually
more
debased
it
is
tolerably
certain
that
what
are
known
as
the
mediterranean
alphabets
were
derived
from
a
selection
of
the
signs
used
in
these

marks

an

by
accident
in

the

was
so
wet

the
bones
were
mostly
dissolved

only
fragments
of
the
skull
crushed
under
an
inverted

here
but
since
there
is
no
museum
in

where
such
a

be
placed
it
was
sent
to

be
arranged

description

come
to
light
in
such
considerable
quantities
during
the
past
few
years
that
their
study
became
a
special
branch
of
egyptology
as
to
the
earliest
sealings
it
was
not
until
the
time
of
den
that
a
broad
uniformity
of
style
was
established
the
seals
of
the
second
dynasty
are
generally
of
a
smaller
style
and
more
elaborately
worked
than
those
of
the
first
dynasty
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
conclude
that
the
later
seals
were
made
in
stone

metal

than
in

shows
a
very
fair
type
of
the
figuring
of
men
and
animals
at
the
time
of
the
first
dynasty
as
a
survival
of
the
prehistoric
manner
of
engraving
here
then
at
the
very
dawn
of
history
we
find
a
spirited
depiction
of
the
human
form
for
rude
though
it
is
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
it
is
a
representation
of
the
human
figure
and
stiff
and
ungainly
though
the
action
of
the
drawing
be
there
can
be
no

to
the
progressive
movement

the
