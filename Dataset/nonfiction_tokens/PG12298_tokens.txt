the
grand
cañon
of
the
colorado
by
john
muir
happy
nowadays
is
the
tourist
with
wonders
new
and
old
spread
invitingly
open
before
him
and
a
host
of
able
workers
as
his
slaves
making
everything
easy
padding
plush
about
him
grading
roads
for
him
boring
tunnels
moving
hills
out
of
his
way
eager
like
the
devil
to
show
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
their
glory
and
foolishness
spiritualizing
travel
for
him
with
lightning
and
steam
abolishing
space
and
time
and
almost
everything
else
little
children
and
tender
pulpy
people
as
well
as
explorers
may
now
go
almost
everywhere
in
smooth
comfort
cross
oceans
and
deserts
scarce
accessible
to
fishes
and
birds
and
dragged
by
steel
horses
go
up
high
mountains
riding
gloriously
beneath
starry
showers
of
sparks
ascending
like
elijah
in
a
whirlwind
and
chariot
of
fire
first
of
the
wonders
of
the
great
west
to
be
brought
within
reach
of
the
tourist
were
the
yosemite
and
the
big
trees
on
the
completion
of
the
first
transcontinental
railway
next
came
the
yellowstone
and
icy
alaska
by
the
northern
roads
and
last
the
grand
cañon
of
the
colorado
which
naturally
the
hardest
to
reach
has
now
become
by
a
branch
of
the
santa
fé
the
most
accessible
of
all
of
course
with
this
wonderful
extension
of
steel
ways
through
our
wilderness
there
is
loss
as
well
as
gain
nearly
all
railroads
are
bordered
by
belts
of
desolation
the
finest
wilderness
perishes
as
if
stricken
with
pestilence
bird
and
beast
people
if
not
the
dryads
are
frightened
from
the
groves
too
often
the
groves
also
vanish
leaving
nothing
but
ashes
fortunately
nature
has
a
few
big
places
beyond
power
to
ocean
the
two
icy
ends
of
the
globe
and
the
grand
cañon
when
i
first
heard
of
the
santa
fé
trains
running
to
the
edge
of
the
grand
cañon
of
arizona
i
was
troubled
with
thoughts
of
the
disenchantment
likely
to
follow
but
last
winter
when
i
saw
those
trains
crawling
along
through
the
pines
of
the
cocanini
forest
and
close
up
to
the
brink
of
the
chasm
at
bright
angel
i
was
glad
to
discover
that
in
the
presence
of
such
stupendous
scenery
they
are
nothing
the
locomotives
and
trains
are
mere
beetles
and
caterpillars
and
the
noise
they
make
is
as
little
disturbing
as
the
hooting
of
an
owl
in
the
lonely
woods
in
a
dry
hot
monotonous
forested
plateau
seemingly
boundless
you
come
suddenly
and
without
warning
upon
the
abrupt
edge
of
a
gigantic
sunken
landscape
of
the
wildest
most
multitudinous
features
and
those
features
sharp
and
angular
are
made
out
of
flat
beds
of
limestone
and
sandstone
forming
a
spiry
jagged
gloriously
colored
countersunk
in
a
level
gray
plain
it
is
a
hard
job
to
sketch
it
even
in
scrawniest
outline
and
try
as
i
may
not
in
the
least
sparing
myself
i
can
not
tell
the
hundredth
part
of
the
wonders
of
its
gorges
alcoves
cloisters
and
amphitheaters
of
vast
sweep
and
depth
carved
in
its
magnificent
walls
the
throng
of
great
architectural
rocks
it
contains
resembling
castles
cathedrals
temples
and
palaces
towered
and
spired
and
painted
some
of
them
nearly
a
mile
high
yet
beneath
feet
all
this
however
is
less
difficult
than
to
give
any
idea
of
the
impression
of
wild
primeval
beauty
and
power
one
receives
in
merely
gazing
from
its
brink
the
view
down
the
gulf
of
color
and
over
the
rim
of
its
wonderful
wall
more
than
any
other
view
i
know
leads
us
to
think
of
our
earth
as
a
star
with
stars
swimming
in
light
every
radiant
spire
pointing
the
way
to
the
heavens
but
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
what
the
cañon
is
or
what
impression
it
makes
from
descriptions
or
pictures
however
good
naturally
it
is
untellable
even
to
those
who
have
seen
something
perhaps
a
little
like
it
on
a
small
scale
in
this
same
plateau
region
most
extravagant
expectations
are
indefinitely
surpassed
though
one
expect
much
from
what
is
said
of
it
as
biggest
chasm
on
big
is
it
that
all
other
big
things
the
yellowstone
the
pyramids
chicago
would
be
lost
if
tumbled
into
naturally
enough
illustrations
as
to
size
are
sought
for
among
other
cañons
like
or
unlike
it
with
the
common
result
of
worse
confounding
confusion
the
prudent
keep
silence
it
was
once
said
that
the
cañon
could
put
a
dozen
yosemites
in
its
vest
the
justly
famous
grand
cañon
of
the
yellowstone
is
like
the
colorado
gorgeously
colored
and
abruptly
countersunk
in
a
plateau
and
both
are
mainly
the
work
of
water
but
the
cañon
is
more
than
a
thousand
times
larger
and
as
a
score
or
two
new
buildings
of
ordinary
size
would
not
appreciably
change
the
general
view
of
a
great
city
so
hundreds
of
yellowstones
might
be
eroded
in
the
sides
of
the
colorado
cañon
without
noticeably
augmenting
its
size
or
the
richness
of
its
sculpture
but
it
is
not
true
that
the
great
yosemite
rocks
would
be
thus
lost
or
hidden
nothing
of
their
kind
in
the
world
so
far
as
i
know
rivals
el
capitan
and
tissiack
much
less
dwarfs
or
in
any
way
belittles
them
none
of
the
sandstone
or
limestone
precipices
of
the
cañon
that
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
approaches
in
smooth
flawless
strength
and
grandeur
the
granite
face
of
el
capitan
or
the
tenaya
side
of
rest
these
colossal
cliffs
types
of
permanence
are
about
three
thousand
and
six
thousand
feet
high
those
of
the
cañon
that
are
sheer
are
about
half
as
high
and
are
types
of
fleeting
change
while
tissiack
noblest
of
mountain
buildings
far
from
being
overshadowed
or
lost
in
this
rosy
spiry
cañon
company
would
draw
every
eye
and
in
serene
majesty
them
she
would
take
her
temple
palace
or
tower
nevertheless
a
noted
writer
comparing
the
grand
cañon
in
a
general
way
with
the
glacial
yosemite
says
the
the
lovely
yosemite
dumped
down
into
the
wilderness
of
gorges
and
mountains
it
would
take
a
guide
who
knew
of
its
existence
a
long
time
to
find
this
is
striking
and
shows
up
well
above
the
levels
of
commonplace
description
but
it
is
confusing
and
has
the
fatal
fault
of
not
being
true
as
well
try
to
describe
an
eagle
by
putting
a
lark
in
it
the
the
lovely
lark
dumped
down
the
red
royal
gorge
of
the
eagle
it
would
be
hard
to
each
in
its
own
place
is
better
singing
at
gate
and
sailing
the
sky
with
the
clouds
every
feature
of
big
face
is
beautiful
and
hollow
wrinkle
furrow
and
line
this
is
the
main
master
furrow
of
its
kind
on
our
continent
incomparably
greater
and
more
impressive
than
any
other
yet
discovered
or
likely
to
be
discovered
now
that
all
the
great
rivers
have
been
traced
to
their
heads
the
colorado
river
rises
in
the
heart
of
the
continent
on
the
dividing
ranges
and
ridges
between
the
two
oceans
drains
thousands
of
snowy
mountains
through
narrow
or
spacious
valleys
and
thence
through
cañons
of
every
color
and
deep
all
of
which
seem
to
be
represented
in
this
one
grand
cañon
of
cañons
it
is
very
hard
to
give
anything
like
an
adequate
conception
of
its
size
much
more
of
its
color
its
vast
the
wealth
of
ornate
architectural
buildings
that
fill
it
or
most
of
all
the
tremendous
impression
it
makes
according
to
major
powell
it
is
about
two
hundred
and
seventeen
miles
long
from
five
to
fifteen
miles
wide
from
rim
to
rim
and
from
about
five
thousand
to
six
thousand
feet
deep
so
tremendous
a
chasm
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
wonders
even
if
like
ordinary
cañons
cut
in
sedimentary
rocks
it
were
empty
and
its
walls
were
simple
but
instead
of
being
plain
the
walls
are
so
deeply
and
elaborately
carved
into
all
sorts
of
cirques
amphitheaters
and
were
you
to
trace
the
rim
closely
around
on
both
sides
your
journey
would
be
nearly
a
thousand
miles
long
into
all
these
recesses
the
level
continuous
beds
of
rock
in
ledges
and
benches
with
their
various
colors
run
like
broad
ribbons
marvelously
beautiful
and
effective
even
at
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
and
the
vast
space
these
glorious
walls
inclose
instead
of
being
empty
is
crowded
with
gigantic
architectural
rock
forms
gorgeously
colored
and
adorned
with
towers
and
spires
like
works
of
art
looking
down
from
this
level
plateau
we
are
more
impressed
with
a
feeling
of
being
on
the
top
of
everything
than
when
looking
from
the
summit
of
a
mountain
from
side
to
side
of
the
vast
gulf
temples
palaces
towers
and
spires
come
soaring
up
in
thick
array
half
a
mile
or
nearly
a
mile
above
their
sunken
hidden
bases
some
to
a
level
with
our
standpoint
but
none
higher
and
in
the
inspiring
morning
light
all
are
so
fresh
and
that
they
seem
as
if
like
the
crimson
of
the
california
woods
they
had
just
sprung
up
hatched
by
the
warm
brooding
motherly
weather
in
trying
to
describe
the
great
pines
and
sequoias
of
the
sierra
i
have
often
thought
that
if
one
of
those
trees
could
be
set
by
itself
in
some
city
park
its
grandeur
might
there
be
impressively
realized
while
in
its
home
forests
where
all
magnitudes
are
great
the
weary
satiated
traveler
sees
none
of
them
truly
it
is
so
with
these
majestic
rock
structures
though
mere
residual
masses
of
the
plateau
they
are
dowered
with
the
grandeur
and
repose
of
mountains
together
with
the
finely
chiseled
carving
and
modeling
of
temples
and
palaces
and
often
to
a
considerable
extent
with
their
symmetry
some
closely
observed
look
like
ruins
but
even
these
stand
plumb
and
true
and
show
architectural
forms
loaded
with
lines
strictly
regular
and
decorative
and
all
are
arrayed
in
colors
that
storms
and
time
seem
only
to
brighten
they
are
not
placed
in
regular
rows
in
line
with
the
river
but
through
ither
as
the
scotch
say
in
lavish
exuberant
crowds
as
if
nature
in
wildest
extravagance
held
her
bravest
structures
as
common
as
yonder
stands
a
spiry
cathedral
nearly
five
thousand
feet
in
height
nobly
symmetrical
with
sheer
buttressed
walls
and
arched
doors
and
windows
as
richly
finished
and
decorated
with
sculptures
as
the
great
rock
temples
of
india
or
egypt
beside
it
rises
a
huge
castle
with
arched
gateway
turrets
ramparts
and
to
right
and
left
palaces
obelisks
and
pyramids
fairly
fill
the
gulf
all
colossal
and
all
lavishly
painted
and
carved
here
and
there
a
structure
may
be
seen
or
one
imperfectly
domed
but
the
prevailing
style
is
ornate
gothic
with
many
hints
of
egyptian
and
indian
throughout
this
vast
extent
of
wild
own
capital
seem
to
be
no
ordinary
dwellings
all
look
like
grand
and
important
public
structures
except
perhaps
some
of
the
lower
pyramids
and
covered
with
talus
like
loosely
set
tents
with
hollow
sagging
sides
the
roofs
often
have
disintegrated
rocks
heaped
and
draggled
over
them
but
in
the
main
the
masonry
is
firm
and
laid
in
regular
courses
as
if
done
by
square
and
rule
nevertheless
they
are
ever
changing
their
tops
are
now
a
dome
now
a
flat
table
or
a
spire
as
harder
or
softer
strata
are
reached
in
their
slow
degradation
while
the
sides
with
all
their
fine
moldings
are
being
steadily
undermined
and
eaten
away
but
no
essential
change
in
style
or
color
is
thus
effected
from
century
to
century
they
stand
the
same
what
seems
confusion
among
the
rough
crags
nearest
one
comes
to
order
as
soon
as
the
main
plan
of
the
various
structures
appears
every
building
however
complicated
and
laden
with
ornamental
lines
is
at
one
with
itself
and
every
one
of
its
neighbors
for
the
same
characteristic
controlling
belts
of
color
and
solid
strata
extend
with
wonderful
constancy
for
very
great
distances
and
pass
through
and
give
style
to
thousands
of
separate
structures
however
their
smaller
characters
may
vary
of
all
the
various
kinds
of
ornamental
work
displayed
tracery
on
moldings
arches
pinnacles
is
more
admirably
effective
or
charms
more
than
the
webs
of
taluses
marvelously
extensive
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
waste
or
excess
they
cover
roofs
and
and
the
base
of
every
cliff
belt
each
spire
and
pyramid
and
massy
towering
temple
and
in
beautiful
continuous
lines
go
sweeping
along
the
great
walls
in
and
out
around
all
the
intricate
system
of
amphitheaters
cirques
and
scallops
into
which
they
are
sculptured
from
one
point
hundreds
of
miles
of
this
fairy
embroidery
may
be
traced
it
is
all
so
fine
and
orderly
that
it
would
seem
that
not
only
had
the
clouds
and
streams
been
kept
harmoniously
busy
in
the
making
of
it
but
that
every
raindrop
sent
like
a
bullet
to
a
mark
had
been
the
subject
of
a
separate
thought
so
sure
is
the
outcome
of
beauty
through
the
stormy
centuries
surely
nowhere
else
are
there
illustrations
so
striking
of
the
natural
beauty
of
desolation
and
death
so
many
of
own
mountain
buildings
wasting
in
glory
of
high
desert
to
dust
see
how
steadfast
in
beauty
they
all
are
in
their
going
look
again
and
again
how
the
rough
dusty
boulders
and
sand
of
disintegration
from
the
upper
ledges
wreathe
in
beauty
the
next
and
next
below
with
these
wonderful
taluses
and
how
the
colors
are
finer
the
faster
the
waste
we
oftentimes
see
nature
giving
beauty
for
ashes
in
the
flowers
of
a
prairie
after
fire
here
the
very
dust
and
ashes
are
beautiful
gazing
across
the
mighty
chasm
we
at
last
discover
that
it
is
not
its
great
depth
nor
length
nor
yet
these
wonderful
buildings
that
most
impresses
us
it
is
its
immense
width
sharply
defined
by
precipitous
walls
plunging
suddenly
down
from
a
flat
plain
declaring
in
terms
instantly
apprehended
that
the
vast
gulf
is
a
gash
in
the
once
unbroken
plateau
made
by
slow
orderly
erosion
and
removal
of
huge
beds
of
rocks
other
valleys
of
erosion
are
as
great
all
their
dimensions
some
are
greater
none
of
these
produces
an
effect
on
the
imagination
at
once
so
quick
and
profound
coming
without
study
given
at
a
glance
therefore
by
far
the
greatest
and
most
influential
feature
of
this
view
from
bright
angel
or
any
other
of
the
cañon
views
is
the
opposite
wall
of
the
one
beneath
our
feet
we
see
only
fragmentary
sections
in
cirques
and
amphitheaters
and
on
the
sides
of
the
outjutting
promontories
between
them
while
the
other
though
far
distant
is
beheld
in
all
its
glory
of
color
and
noble
one
supreme
beauty
and
wonder
to
which
the
eye
is
ever
turning
for
while
charming
with
its
beauty
it
tells
the
story
of
the
stupendous
erosion
of
the
foundation
of
the
unspeakable
impression
made
on
everybody
it
seems
a
gigantic
statement
for
even
nature
to
make
all
in
one
mighty
stone
word
apprehended
at
once
like
a
burst
of
light
celestial
color
its
natural
vesture
coming
in
glory
to
mind
and
heart
as
to
a
home
prepared
for
it
from
the
very
beginning
wildness
so
godful
cosmic
primeval
bestows
a
new
sense
of
beauty
and
size
not
even
from
high
mountains
does
the
world
seem
so
wide
so
like
a
star
in
glory
of
light
on
its
way
through
the
heavens
i
have
observed
of
all
sorts
getting
first
views
of
yosemites
glaciers
while
mountain
ranges
etc
mixed
with
the
enthusiasm
which
such
scenery
naturally
excites
there
is
often
weak
gushing
and
many
splutter
aloud
like
little
waterfalls
here
for
a
few
moments
at
least
there
is
silence
and
all
are
in
dead
earnest
as
if
awed
and
hushed
by
an
until
the
cook
cries
or
the
are
ready
then
the
poor
unfortunates
slaves
of
regular
habits
turn
quickly
away
gasping
and
muttering
as
if
wondering
where
they
had
been
and
what
had
enchanted
them
roads
have
been
made
from
bright
angel
hotel
through
the
cocanini
forest
to
the
ends
of
outstanding
promontories
commanding
extensive
views
up
and
down
the
cañon
the
nearest
of
them
three
or
four
miles
east
and
west
are

few

and
the

at

by

makes

little

it
is
a
vast
wilderness
of
rocks
in
a
sea
of
light
colored
and
glowing
like
oak
and
maple
woods
in
autumn
when
the
is
richest
i
have
just
said
that
it
is
impossible
to
learn
what
the

is
like
from
descriptions
and

and
descriptions
present
magnificent
views
not
only
of
the
cañon

of
all
the
grand
region
round
about
it
and

are
wonderfully
good
surely
faithful
and
loving
skill
can
go
no

in
putting
the
multitudinous
decorated

on
paper

the
the
living
rejoicing
chanting
morning
and
evening
in
chorus
to
heaven
whose
brush
or
pencil
however
lovingly
inspired
can
give
us
these
and
if
paint
is
of
no
effect
what
hope
lies
in
only
this
some
may
be
incited
by
it
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
no
other
range
of
mountainous
of
anything
like
the
same
extent
have
i
seen
that
is
so
strangely
boldly
lavishly
colored
the
famous
yellowstone
cañon
below
the
falls
comes
to
mind
but
wonderful
as
it
is
and
well
deserved
as
is
its
fame
compared
with
this
it
is
only
a
bright
rainbow
ribbon
at
the
roots
of
the
pines
each
of
the
series
of
level
continuous
beds
of
carboniferous
rocks
of
the
cañon
has
as
we
have
seen
its
own
characteristic
color
the
summit
are
pale
yellow
next
below
these
are
the
beautiful
sandstones
next
there
are
a
thousand
feet
of
brilliant
red
sandstones
and
below
these
the
red
wall
limestones
over
two
thousand
feet
thick
rich
massy
red
the
greatest
and
most
influential
of
the
series
and
forming
the
main
between
these
are
many
beds
the
prevailing
colors
are
wonderfully
deep
and
clear
changing
and
blending
with
varying
intensity
from
hour
to
hour
day
to
day
season
to
season
throbbing
wavering
glowing
responding
to
every
passing
cloud
or
storm
a
world
of
color
in
itself
now
burning
in
separate
rainbow
bars
streaked
and
blotched
with
shade
now
glowing
in
one
smooth
ethereal
radiance
like
the
alpenglow
uniting
the
rocky
world
with
the
heavens
the
dawn
as
in
all
the
pure
dry
desert
country
is
ineffably
beautiful
and
when
the
first
level
sunbeams
sting
the
domes
and
spires
with
what
a
burst
of
power
the
big
wild
days
begin
the
dead
and
the
living
rocks
and
hearts
alike
awake
and
sing
the
song
of
creation
all
the
massy
headlands
and
salient
angles
of
the
walls
and
the
multitudinous
temples
and
palaces
seem
to
catch
the
light
at
once
and
cast
thick
black
shadows
athwart
hollow
and
gorge
bringing
out
details
as
well
as
the
main
massive
features
of
the
architecture
while
all
the
rocks
as
if
wild
with
life
throb
and
quiver
and
glow
in
the
glorious
sunburst
rejoicing
every
rock
temple
then
becomes
a
temple
of
music
every
spire
and
pinnacle
an
angel
of
light
and
song
shouting
color
halleluiahs
as
the
day
draws
to
a
close
shadows
wondrous
black
and
thick
like
those
of
the
morning
fill
up
the
wall
hollows
while
the
glowing
rocks
their
rough
angles
burned
off
seem
soft
and
hot
to
the
heart
as
they
stand
submerged
in
purple
haze
which
now
fills
the
cañon
like
a
sea
still
deeper
richer
more
divine
grow
the
great
walls
and
temples
until
in
the
supreme
flaming
glory
of
sunset
the
whole
cañon
is
transfigured
as
if
all
the
life
and
light
of
centuries
of
sunshine
stored
up
and
condensed
in
the
rocks
was
now
being
poured
forth
as
from
one
glorious
fountain
flooding
both
earth
and
sky
strange
to
say
in
the
full
white
effulgence
of
the
midday
hours
the
bright
colors
grow
dim
and
terrestrial
in
common
gray
haze
and
the
rocks
after
the
manner
of
mountains
seem
to
crouch
and
drowse
and
shrink
to
less
than
half
their
real
stature
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
one
as
if
not
at
home
but
it
is
fine
to
see
how
quickly
they
come
to
life
and
grow
radiant
and
communicative
as
soon
as
a
band
of
white
clouds
come
floating
by
as
if
shouting
for
joy
they
seem
to
spring
up
to
meet
them
in
hearty
salutation
eager
to
touch
them
and
beg
their
blessings
it
is
just
in
the
midst
of
these
dull
midday
hours
that
the
cañon
clouds
are
born
a
good
full
of
lightning
and
rain
on
its
way
to
its
work
on
a
sunny
desert
day
is
a
glorious
object
across
the
cañon
opposite
the
hotel
is
a
little
tributary
of
the
colorado
called
bright
angel
creek
a
still
better
deserves
the
name
of
the
desert
in
bright
plumage
carrying
cool
shade
and
living
water
to
countless
animals
and
plants
ready
to
perish
noble
in
form
and
gesture
seeming
able
for
anything
pouring
floods
from
its
alabaster
fountains
as
if
some
had
broken
to
every
gulch
and
gorge
on
its
favorite
ground
is
given
a
passionate
torrent
roaring
replying
to
the
rejoicing
tons
in
weight
hurrying
away
as
if
frightened
showing
something
of
the
way
grand
cañon
work
is
done
most
of
the
fertile
summer
clouds
of
the
cañon
are
of
this
sort
massive
swelling
cumuli
growing
rapidly
displaying
delicious
tones
of
purple
and
gray
in
the
hollows
of
their
bosses
showering
favored
areas
of
the
heated
landscape
and
vanishing
in
an
hour
or
two
some
busy
and
glide
with
beautiful
motion
along
the
middle
of
the
cañon
in
flocks
turning
aside
here
and
there
lingering
as
if
studying
the
needs
of
particular
spots
exploring
peering
into
hollows
like
birds
seeking
or
hovering
aloft
on
outspread
wings
they
scan
all
the
red
wilderness
dispensing
their
blessings
of
cool
shadows
and
rain
where
the
need
is
the
greatest
refreshing
the
rocks
their
offspring
as
well
as
the
vegetation
continuing
their
sculpture
deepening
gorges
and
sharpening
peaks
sometimes
blending
all
together
they
weave
a
ceiling
from
rim
to
rim
perhaps
opening
a
window
here
and
there
for
sunshine
to
stream
through
suddenly
lighting
some
palace
or
temple
and
making
it
flare
in
the
rain
as
if
on
fire
sometimes
as
one
sits
gazing
from
a
high
jutting
promontory
the
sky
all
clear
showing
not
the
slightest
wisp
or
penciling
a
bright
band
of
cumuli
will
appear
suddenly
coming
up
the
cañon
in
single
file
as
if
tracing
a
trail
passing
in
review
each
in
turn
darting
its
lances
and
dropping
its
shower
making
a
row
of
little
vertical
rivers
in
the
air
above
the
big
brown
one
others
seem
to
grow
from
mere
points
and
fly
high
above
the
cañon
yet
following
its
course
for
a
long
time
noiseless
as
if
hunting
then
suddenly
darting
lightning
at
unseen
marks
and
hurrying
on
or
they
loiter
here
and
there
as
if
idle
like
laborers
out
of
work
waiting
to
be
hired
half
a
dozen
or
more
showers
may
oftentimes
be
seen
falling
at
once
while
far
the
greater
part
of
the
sky
is
in
sunshine
and
not
a
raindrop
comes
nigh
one
these
from
as
many
separate
clouds
looking
like
wisps
of
long
hair
may
vary
greatly
in
effects
the
pale
faint
streaks
are
showers
that
fail
to
reach
the
ground
being
evaporated
on
the
way
down
through
the
dry
thirsty
air
like
streams
in
deserts
many
on
the
other
hand
which
in
the
distance
seem
insignificant
are
really
heavy
rain
however
local
these
are
the
gray
wisps
well
zigzagged
with
lightning
the
darker
ones
are
torrent
rain
which
on
broad
steep
slopes
of
favorable
conformation
give
rise
to
and
wonderful
is
the
commotion
they
cause
the
gorges
and
gulches
below
them
usually
dry
break
out
in
loud
uproar
with
a
sudden
downrush
of
muddy
floods
down
they
all
go
in
one
simultaneous
gush
roaring
like
lions
rudely
awakened
each
of
the
tawny
brood
actually
kicking
up
a
dust
at
the
first
onset
during
the
winter
months
snow
falls
over
all
the
high
plateau
usually
to
a
considerable
depth
whitening
the
rim
and
the
roofs
of
the
cañon
buildings
but
last
winter
when
i
arrived
at
bright
angel
in
the
middle
of
january
there
was
no
snow
in
sight
and
the
ground
was
dry
greatly
to
my
disappointment
for
i
had
made
the
trip
mainly
to
see
the
cañon
in
its
winter
garb
soothingly
i
was
informed
that
this
was
an
exceptional
season
and
that
the
good
snow
might
arrive
at
any
time
after
waiting
a
few
days
i
gladly
hailed
a
cloud
coming
grandly
on
from
the
west
in
big
promising
blackness
very
unlike
the
white
sailors
of
the
summer
skies
under
the
lee
of
a
with
another
i
watched
its
movements
as
it
took
possession
of
the
cañon
and
all
the
adjacent
region
in
sight
trailing
its
gray
fringes
over
the
spiry
tops
of
the
great
temples
and
towers
it
gradually
settled
lower
embracing
them
all
with
ineffable
kindness
and
gentleness
of
touch
and
fondled
the
little
cedars
and
pines
as
they
quivered
eagerly
in
the
wind
like
young
birds
begging
their
mothers
to
feed
them
the
first
flakes
and
crystals
began
to
fly
about
noon
sweeping
straight
up
the
middle
of
the
cañon
and
swirling
in
magnificent
eddies
along
the
sides
gradually
the
hearty
swarms
closed
their
ranks
and
all
the
cañon
was
lost
in
gray
gloom
except
a
short
section
of
the
wall
and
a
few
trees
beside
us
which
looked
glad
with
snow
in
their
needles
and
about
their
feet
as
they
leaned
out
over
the
gulf
suddenly
the
storm
opened
with
magical
effect
to
the
north
over
the
cañon
of
bright
angel
creek
inclosing
a
sunlit
mass
of
the
cañon
architecture
spanned
by
great
white
concentric
arches
of
cloud
like
the
bows
of
a
silvery
aurora
above
these
and
a
little
back
of
them
was
a
series
of
upboiling
purple
clouds
and
high
above
all
in
the
background
a
range
of
noble
cumuli
towered
aloft
like
mountains
their
pure
pearl
bosses
flooded
with
sunshine
the
whole
noble
picture
calmly
glowing
was
framed
in
thick
gray
gloom
which
soon
closed
over
it
and
the
storm
went
on
opening
and
closing
until
night
covered
all
two
days
later
when
we
were
on
a
jutting
point
about
eighteen
miles
east
of
bright
angel
and
one
thousand
feet
higher
we
enjoyed
another
storm
of
equal
glory
as
to
cloud
effects
though
only
a
few
inches
of
snow
fell
before
the
storm
began
we
had
a
magnificent
view
of
this
grander
upper
part
of
the
cañon
and
also
of
the
cocanini
forest
and
painted
desert
the
march
of
the
clouds
with
their
flying
over
this
sublime
landscape
was
unspeakably
glorious
and
so
also
was
the
breaking
up
of
the
storm
next
mingling
of
rock
sunshine
and
cloud
most
tourists
make
out
to
be
in
a
hurry
even
here
therefore
their
few
days
or
hours
would
be
best
spent
on
the
promontories
nearest
the
hotel
yet
a
surprising
number
go
down
the
bright
angel
trail
to
the
brink
of
the
inner
gloomy
granite
gorge
overlooking
the
river
deep
cañons
attract
like
high
mountains
the
deeper
they
are
the
more
surely
are
we
drawn
into
them
on
foot
of
course
there
is
no
danger
whatever
and
with
ordinary
precautions
but
little
on
animals
in
comfortable
tourist
faith
unthinking
unfearing
down
go
men
women
and
children
on
whatever
is
offered
horse
mule
or
burro
as
if
saying
with
jean
paul
nothing
but
without
reason
for
these
cañon
trails
down
the
stairways
of
the
gods
are
less
dangerous
than
they
seem
less
dangerous
than
home
stairs
the
guides
are
cautious
and
so
are
the
experienced
beasts
the
scrawniest
rosinantes
and
mules
cling
hard
to
the
rocks
endwise
or
sidewise
like
lizards
or
ants
from
terrace
to
terrace
climate
to
climate
down
one
creeps
in
sun
and
shade
through
gorge
and
gully
and
grassy
ravine
and
after
a
long
scramble
on
foot
at
last
beneath
the
mighty
cliffs
one
comes
to
the
grand
roaring
river
to
the
mountaineer
the
depth
of
the
cañon
from
five
thousand
to
six
thousand
feet
will
not
seem
so
very
wonderful
for
he
has
often
explored
others
that
are
about
as
deep
but
the
most
experienced
will
be
but
the
vast
extent
of
strange
countersunk
scenery
the
multitude
of
huge
rock
monuments
of
painted
masonry
built
up
in
regular
courses
towering
above
beneath
and
round
about
him
by
the
bright
angel
trail
the
last
fifteen
hundred
feet
of
the
descent
to
the
river
has
to
be
made
afoot
down
the
gorge
of
indian
garden
creek
most
of
the
visitors
do
not
like
this
part
and
are
content
to
stop
at
the
end
of
the
and
look
down
on
the
flood
from
the
edge
of
the
indian
garden
plateau
by
the
new
hance
trail
excepting
a
few
daringly
steep
spots
you
can
ride
all
the
way
to
the
river
where
there
is
a
good
spacious
in
a
this
trail
built
by
brave
hance
begins
on
the
highest
part
of
the
rim
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
the
head
of
bright
angel
trail
and
the
descent
is
a
little
over
six
thousand
feet
through
a
wonderful
variety
of
climate
and
life
often
late
in
the
fall
when
frosty
winds
are
blowing
and
snow
is
flying
at
one
end
of
the
trail
tender
plants
are
blooming
in
balmy
summer
weather
at
the
other
the
trip
down
and
up
can
be
made
afoot
easily
in
a
day
in
this
way
one
is
free
to
observe
the
scenery
and
vegetation
instead
of
merely
clinging
to
his
animal
and
watching
its
steps
but
all
who
have
time
should
go
prepared
to
camp
awhile
on
the
riverbank
to
rest
and
learn
something
about
the
plants
and
animals
and
the
mighty
flood
roaring
past
in
cool
shady
amphitheaters
at
the
head
of
the
trail
there
are
groves
of
white
silver
fir
and
douglas
spruce
with
ferns
and
saxifrages
that
recall
snowy
mountains
below
these
yellow
pine
juniper
ash
maple
berberis
cowania
spiraea
dwarf
oak
and
other
small
shrubs
and
trees
in
dry
gulches
and
on
taluses
and
crags
are
sparsely
scattered
yuccas
cactuses
agave
etc
where
springs
gush
from
the
rocks
there
are
willow
thickets
grassy
flats
and
bright
flowery
gardens
and
in
the
hottest
recesses
the
delicate
abronia
mesquit
woody
compositae
and
arborescent
cactuses
the
most
striking
and
characteristic
part
of
this
widely
varied
vegetation
are
the
leafless
plants
with
beautiful
flowers
and
fruit
in
every
way
able
and
admirable
while
grimly
defending
themselves
with
innumerable
barbed
spears
they
offer
both
food
and
drink
to
man
and
beast
their
juicy
globes
and
disks
and
fluted
cylindrical
columns
are
almost
the
only
desert
wells
that
never
go
dry
and
they
always

by
the

it
is
a
picturesque

of

about

thrust
through
its

almost
every
desert
bird
and
beast
come
to
it
to
be
fed
to
civilized
people
from
corn
and
cattle
and
countries
the
cañon
at
first
sight
seems
as
uninhabitable
as
a
glacier
crevasse
utterly
silent
and
barren
nevertheless
it
is
the
home
of
a
multitude
of
our
men
as
well
as
animals
and
plants
centuries
ago
it
was
inhabited
by
tribes
of
indians
who
long
before
columbus
saw
america
built
thousands
of
stone
houses
in
its
crags
and
large
ones
some
of
them
several
stories
high
with
hundreds
of
rooms
on
the
mesas
of
the
adjacent
regions
their
almost
numberless
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
cañon
scattered
along
both
sides
from
top
to
bottom
and
throughout
its
entire
length
built
of
stone
and
mortar
in
seams
and
fissures
like
nests
or
on
isolated
ridges
and
peaks
the
ruins
of
larger
buildings
are
found
on
open
spots
by
the
river
but
most
of
them
aloft
on
the
brink
of
the
wildest
giddiest
precipices
sites
evidently
chosen
for
safety
from
enemies
and
seemingly
accessible
only
to
the
birds
of
the
air
many
caves
were
also
used
as
as
were
mere
seams
on
formed
by
unequal
weathering
and
with
or
without
outer
or
side
walls
and
some
of
them
were
covered
with
colored
pictures
of
animals
the
most
interesting
of
these
had
pathetic
little
strips
of
garden
on
narrow
terraces
where
could
be
carried
to
romantic
of
but
eloquent
of
hard
times
in
recesses
along
the
river
and
on
the
first
plateau
flats
above
its
gorge
were
fields
and
gardens
of
considerable
size
where
may
still
be
traced
some
of
these
ancient
gardens
are
still
cultivated
by
indians
descendants
of
cliff
dwellers
who
raise
corn
squashes
melons
potatoes
to
reinforce
the
produce
of
the
many
wild
plants
nuts
beans
berries
yucca
and
cactus
fruits
grass
and
sunflower
seeds
and
the
flesh
of
animals
deer
rabbits
lizards
etc
the
cañon
indians
i
have
met
here
seem
to
be
living
much
as
did
their
ancestors
though
not
now
driven
into
rock
dens
they
are
able
erect
men
with
commanding
eyes
which
nothing
that
they
wish
to
see
can
escape
they
are
never
in
a
hurry
have
a
strikingly
measured
deliberate
bearish
manner
of
moving
the
limbs
and
turning
the
head
are
capable
of
enduring
weather
thirst
hunger
and
and
are
blessed
with
stomachs
which
triumph
over
everything
the
wilderness
may
offer
evidently
their
lives
are
not
bitter
the
largest
of
the
cañon
animals
one
is
likely
to
see
is
the
wild
sheep
or
rocky
mountain
bighorn
a
most
admirable
beast
with
limbs
that
never
fail
at
home
on
the
most
precipices
acquainted
with
all
the
springs
and
passes
and
jumpable
places
in
the
sheer
ribbon
cliffs
bounding
from
crag
to
crag
in
easy
grace
and
confidence
of
strength
his
great
horns
held
high
above
his
shoulders
wild
red
blood
beating
and
hissing
through
every
fiber
of
him
like
the
wind
through
a
quivering
mountain
pine
deer
also
are
occasionally
met
in
the
cañon
making
their
way
to
the
river
when
the
wells
of
the
plateau
are
dry
along
the
short
spring
streams
beavers
are
still
busy
as
is
shown
by
the
and
willow
timber
they
have
cut
and
peeled
found
in
all
the
river
in
the
most
barren
cliffs
and
gulches
there
dwell
a
multitude
of
lesser
animals
happy
little
gophers
skunks
rabbits
bob
cats
and
many
others
gathering
food
or
dozing
in
their
dens
lizards
too
of
every
kind
and
color
are
here
enjoying
life
on
the
hot
cliffs
and
making
the
brightest
of
them
brighter
nor
is
there
any
lack
of
feathered
people
the
golden
eagle
may
be
seen
and
the
osprey
hawks
jays
the
and
cheery
familiar
grosbeak
robin
bluebird
thrush
and
many
warblers
sailing
the
sky
and
enlivening
the
rocks
and
bushes
through
all
the
cañon
wilderness
here
at
river
camp
or
a
few
miles
above
it
brave
powell
and
his
brave
men
passed
their
first
night
in
the
cañon
on
their
adventurous
voyage
of
discovery
years
ago
they
faced
a
thousand
dangers
open
or
hidden
now
in
their
boats
gladly
sliding
down
swift
smooth
reaches
now
rolled
over
and
over
in
surges
of
rough
roaring
cataracts
sucked
under
in
eddies
swimming
like
beavers
tossed
and
beaten
like
castaway
undaunted
doing
their
work
through
it
all
after
a
month
of
this
they
floated
smoothly
out
of
the
dark
gloomy
roaring
abyss
into
light
and
safety
two
hundred
miles
below
as
the
flood
rushes
past
us
with
desert
mud
we
naturally
think
of
its
sources
its
countless
silvery
branches
outspread
on
thousands
of
snowy
mountains
along
the
crest
of
the
continent
and
the
life
of
them
the
beauty
of
them
their
history
and
romance
its
topmost
springs
are
far
north
and
east
in
wyoming
and
colorado
on
the
snowy
wind
river
front
park
and
sawatch
ranges
dividing
the
two
ocean
waters
and
the
elk
wasatch
uinta
and
innumerable
spurs
streaked
with
streams
made
famous
by
early
explorers
and
hunters
it
is
a
river
of
du

san

yampa
dolores
gunnison
cotchetopa
uncompahgre
eagle
and
roaring
rivers
the
green
and
the
grand
and
scores
of
others
with
branches
innumerable
as
mad
and
glad
a
band
as
ever
sang
on
mountains
descending
in
glory
of
foam
and
spray
from
and
glaciers
through
their
rocky
channels
then
all
emerging
from
dark
balsam
and
pine
woods
and
coming
together
they
meander
through
wide
sunny
park
valleys
and
at
length
enter
the
great
plateau
and
flow
in
deep
cañons
the
beginning
of
the
system
culminating
in
this
grand
cañon
of
cañons
our
warm
cañon
camp
is
also
a
good
place
to
give
a
thought
to
the
glaciers
which
still
exist
at
the
heads
of
the
highest
tributaries
some
of
them
are
of
considerable
size
especially
those
on
the
wind
river
and
sawatch
ranges
in
wyoming
and
colorado
they
are
remnants
of
a
vast
system
of
glaciers
which
recently
covered
the
upper
part
of
the
colorado
basin
sculptured
its
peaks
ridges
and
valleys
to
their
present
forms
and
extended
far
out
over
the
plateau
far
i
can
not
now
say
it
appears
therefore
that
however
old
the
main
trunk
of
the
colorado
may
be
all
its
upper
branches
and
the
landscapes
they
flow
through
are
scarce
at
all
changed
as
yet
in
any
important
feature
since
they
first
came
to
light
at
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
the
grand
colorado
plateau
of
which
the
grand
cañon
is
only
one
of
its
features
extends
with
a
breadth
of
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
flanks
of
the
wasatch
and
park
mountains
to
the
south
of
the
san
francisco
peaks
immediately
to
the
north
of
the
deepest
part
of
the
cañon
it
rises
in
a
series
of
subordinate
plateaus
diversified
with
green
meadows
marshes
bogs
ponds
forests
and
grovy
park
valleys
a
favorite
indian
inhabited
by
elk
deer
beaver
etc
but
far
the
greater
part
of
the
plateau
is
good
sound
desert
rocky
sandy
or
fluffy
with
loose
ashes
and
dust
dissected
in
some
places
into
a
labyrinth
of
chasms
like
cracks
in
a
dry
or
the
narrow
slit
crevasses
of
glaciers
with
dotted
with
volcanoes
and
beautiful
buttes
and
lined
with
long
continuous
escarpments
vast
bed
of
sediments
of
an
ancient
still
nearly
as
level
as
when
first
laid
down
after
being
heaved
into
the
sky
a
mile
or
two
high
walking
quietly
about
in
the
alleys
and
byways
of
the
grand
cañon
city
we
learn
something
of
the
way
it
was
made
and
all
must
admire
effects
so
great
from
means
apparently
so
simple
rain
striking
light
or
heavier
in
streams
with
many
rest
sundays
soft
air
and
light
gentle
sappers
and
miners
toiling
forever
the
big
river
sawing
the
plateau
asunder
carrying
away
the
eroded
and
ground
waste
and
exposing
the
edges
of
the
strata
to
the
weather
rain
torrents
sawing
and
alleys
exposing
the
strata
in
the
same
way
in
hundreds
of
sections
the
softer
less
resisting
beds
weathering
and
receding
faster
thus
undermining
the
harder
beds
which
fall
not
only
in
small
weathered
particles
but
in
heavy
masses
assisted
down
from
time
to
time
by
kindly
earthquakes
rain
torrents
rushing
the
fallen
material
to
the
river
keeping
the
wall
rocks
constantly
exposed
thus
the
cañon
grows
wider
and
deeper
so
also
do
the
and
amphitheaters
while
secondary
gorges
and
cirques
gradually
isolate
masses
of
the
promontories
forming
new
buildings
all
of
which
are
being
weathered
and
pulled
and
shaken
down
while
being
built
showing
destruction
and
creation
as
one
we
see
the
proudest
temples
and
palaces
in
stateliest
attitudes
wearing
their
sheets
of
detritus
as
royal
robes
shedding
off
showers
of
red
and
yellow
stones
like
trees
in
autumn
shedding
their
leaves
going
to
dust
like
beautiful
days
to
night
proclaiming
as
with
the
tongues
of
angels
the
natural
beauty
of
death
every
building
is
seen
to
be
a
remnant
of
once
continuous
beds
of
and
slime
on
the
floor
of
an
ancient
sea
and
filled
with
the
remains
of
animals
and
that
every
particle
of
the
sandstones
and
limestones
of
these
wonderful
structures
was
derived
from
other
landscapes
weathered
and
rolled
and
ground
in
the
storms
and
streams
of
other
ages
and
when
we
examine
the
escarpments
hills
buttes
and
other
monumental
masses
of
the
plateau
on
either
side
of
the
cañon
we
discover
that
an
amount
of
material
has
been
carried
off
in
the
general
denudation
of
the
region
compared
with
which
even
that
carried
away
in
the
making
of
the
grand
cañon
is
as
nothing
thus
each
wonder
in
sight
becomes
a
window
through
which
other
wonders
come
to
view
in
no
other
part
of
this
continent
are
the
wonders
of
geology
the
records
of
the
auld
lang
syne
more
widely
opened
or
displayed
in
higher
piles
the
whole
cañon
is
a
mine
of
fossils
in
which
five
thousand
feet
of
horizontal
strata
are
exposed
in
regular
succession
over
more
than
a
thousand
square
miles
of
and
on
the
adjacent
plateau
region
there
is
another
series
of
beds
twice
as
thick
forming
a
grand
geological
collection
of
stone
books
covering
thousands
of
miles
of
shelving
tier
on
tier
conveniently
arranged
for
the
student
and
with
what
wonderful
scriptures
are
their
pages
forms
of
successive
floras
and
faunas
lavishly
illustrated
with
colored
drawings
carrying
us
back
into
the
midst
of
the
life
of
a
past
infinitely
remote
and
as
we
go
on
and
on
studying
this
old
old
life
in
the
light
of
the
life
beating
warmly
about
us
we
enrich
and
lengthen
our
own
