without
feeling
that
it
is
a
valuable
contribution

controversy

post
a
remarkable
series

religious
meditations

treat
the
great
questions

mall
iii
iv
v
preface
in
the
first
series
of
these
meditations
i
gave
a
summary
of
the
facts
and
dogmas
which
constitute
as
i
think
the
foundation
and
the
essence
of
the
christian
religion
in
the
next
series
i
retraced
the
reawakening
of
faith
and
of
christian
life
during
the
nineteenth
century
in
france
both
amongst
romanists
and
protestants
with
christianity
thus
reanimated
and
resuscitated
amongst
us
after
having
passed
through
one
of
its
most
violent
trials
i
confronted
the
principal
philosophical
systems
which
in
these
days
reject
and
combat
it
rationalism
positivism
pantheism
materialism
scepticism
i
essayed
to
determine
the
fundamental
error
which
seems
to
me
to
characterize
each
of
those
systems
and
to
have
always
rendered
them
inadequate
to
the
office
either
of
satisfying
or
explaining
man
nature
and
destiny
vi
that
series
of
my
meditations
i
concluded
with
these
words
why
is
it
that
christianity
in
spite
of
all
the
attacks
which
it
has
had
to
undergo
and
all
the
ordeals
through
which
it
has
been
made
to
pass
has
for
eighteen
centuries
satisfied
infinitely
better
the
spontaneous
instincts
and
invincible
cravings
of
humanity
is
it
not
because
it
is
pure
from
the
errors
which
vitiate
the
different
systems
of
philosophy
just
passed
in
review
because
it
fills
up
the
void
that
those
systems
either
create
or
leave
in
the
human
soul
because
in
short
it
conducts
man
nigher
to
the
fountain
of
light

meditations

eighth
meditation
impiety
recklessness
perplexity
p
far
from
wishing
to
elude
any
of
the
difficulties
of
this
question
i
would
now
set
christianity
in
contact
with
the
ideas
and
forces
that
seem
most
contrary
to
it
and
with
three
of
them
more
especially
liberty
independent
morality
and
science
vii
assertions
are
running
the
tour
of
the
world
that
christianity
can
accommodate
itself
neither
to
liberty
nor
science
that
morality
is
essentially
distinct
and
separate
from
religious
faith
all
this
i
hold
to
be
false
and
highly
prejudicial
to
the
very
cause
of
liberty
of
morality
and
of
science
which
those
who
give
utterance
to
such
assertions
affect
to
serve
i
believe
christianity
and
liberty
to
be
not
only
compatible
with
each
other
but
necessary
to
each
other
i
regard
morality
as
naturally
and
intimately
united
to
religion
i
am
convinced
that
christianity
and
science
need
not
make
any
mutual
sacrifices
that
neither
has
anything
to
fear
from
the
other
this
i
establish
in
the
first
three
meditations
of
the
present
series
i
then
enter
into
the
peculiar
domain
of
christianity
and
determine
what
in
the
presence
of
liberty
of
philosophical
morality
and
of
human
science
is
the
principle
and
what
the
bearing
of
christian
ignorance
and
of
christian
faith
viii
i
finally
apply
to
ideas
their
natural
and
inevitable
law
the
law
which
obliges
them
to
express
themselves
in
facts
i
interrogate
theory
thus
transformed
into
practice
and
i
show
that
christianity
alone
supports
this
test
victoriously
christian
life
becomes
a
forcible
demonstration
of
the
legitimacy
of
christian
faith
with
these
three
meditations
the
present
series
concludes
but
to
complete
my
undertaking
a
final
and
capital
question
the
historical
question
remains
to
be
treated
not
that
i
think
of
retracing
the
history
of
christianity
throughout
the
whole
of
its
course
such
a
design
is
far
from
my
thoughts
i
neither
can
nor
wish
to
do
more
than
to
demonstrate
the
grand
historical
facts
which
in
my
opinion
are
in
christianity
the
stamp
of
a
divine
origin
and
of
a
divine
influence
upon
the
development
and
destiny
of
the
human
race
of
these
facts
the
following
is
a
summary
the
authority
of
the
sacred
books
the
primitive
foundation
of
christianity
the
christian
faith
persistent
from
age
to
age
ix
the
church
of
christ
persistent
also
from
age
to
age
romanism
and
protestantism
the
different
antichristian
crises
their
character
and
their
issue
it
is
upon
these
grand
facts
and
the
questions
which
they
suggest
that
historical
criticism
has
in
our
days
exercised
itself
with
ardour
as
it
is
continuing
to
do
science
severe
and
daring
no
invention
of
our
epoch
but
beyond
all
doubt
one
of
its
glories
if
after
concluding
this
final
series
of
my
meditations
i
shall
have
succeeded
in
appreciating
at
their
real
value
the
exigencies
made
and
the
results
obtained
by
historical
criticism
where
it
has
applied
itself
to
the
history
of
christianity
i
shall
have
realised
the
object
which
i
proposed
to
myself
on
voluntarily
entering
upon
this
solemn
and
laborious
study
where
i
meet
with
so
much
that
is
obscure
and
so
many
quicksands
x
but
as
i
draw
near
the
close
a
scruple
seizes
me
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
to
persist
obstinately
in
casting
such
a
work
into
the
midst
of
the
events
and
the
practical
problems
which
are
agitating
the
whole
civilized
world
and
which
are
demanding
their
instant
solution
what
good
result
can
i
expect
from
studying
the
past
history
of
the
christian
religion
in
my
country
or
even
speculating
upon
its
future
prospects
when
the
actual
condition
of
the
present
generation
and
the
lot
of
that
which
is
to
succeed
it
on
the
stage
are
subject
to
so
many
troubles
and
plunged
in
such
darkness
the
more
narrowly
i
scrutinize
generations
the
honour
and
the
destiny
of
which
i
have
so
much
at
heart
for
my
children
form
part
of
them
the
more
am
i
struck
and
disquieted
by
two
facts
on
the
one
side
the
general
sentiment
of
fatigue
and
incertitude
manifesting
itself
in
society
and
in
individuals
on
the
other
side
not
merely
the
grandeur
but
the
unusual
complexity
of
the
questions
agitated
xi
i
fear
that
in
her
lassitude
and
in
her
sceptical
vacillations
france
may
not
render
an
exact
account
to
herself
of
the
problems
and
perils
scattered
over
her
path
of
their
number
their
gravity
and
their
intimate
connexion
i
fear
that
from
not
having
an
accurate
conception
of
what
her
burthen
is
and
from
not
having
the
courage
at
once
to
weigh
it
well
the
moment
when
she
will
have
to
bear
it
will
come
upon
her
with
the
necessary
forces
unmustered
and
the
necessary
resolutions
unformed
almost
every
great
epoch
in
history
has
been
devoted
to
some
question
if
not
an
exclusive
one
at
least
one
dominant
both
in
events
and
opinions
and
around
which
the
varying
opinions
and
the
efforts
of
men
were
concentrated
not
to
go
farther
back
than
the
era
of
modern
history
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
question
of
the
unity
of
religion
and
of
its
reform
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
question
of
pure
monarchy
with
its
conquests
abroad
and
administration
at
home
in
the
eighteenth
century
that
of
the
operation
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
such
have
been
in
france
the
different
points
on
which
ideas
have
culminated
the
different
objects
which
each
social
movement
had
specially
in
view
xii
the
systems
of
the
day
although
opposed
were
clear
the
struggles
ardent
but
well
defined
men
walked
in
those
days
on
high
roads
they
did
not
wander
about
in
the
infinite
complications
of
a
labyrinth
and
it
is
in
a
very
labyrinth
of
questions
and
of
ideas
of
essays
and
events
diverse
in
character
confused
incoherent
contradictory
in
which
in
these
days
the
civilized
world
is
plunged
i
do
not
pretend
to
seize
the
clue
to
the
labyrinth
i
propose
but
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
chaos
first
i
turn
my
eyes
to
the
external
situation
and
relations
of
the
states
of
christendom
and
consider
the
questions
which
concern
the
boundaries
of
territories
and
the
distribution
of
populations
between
distinct
and
independent
nations
formerly
these
questions
were
all
reducible
to
one
the
aggrandizement
or
the
weakening
of
these
different
states
and
the
maintenance
or
the
disturbance
of
that
balance
of
forces
which
was
called
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
xiii
war
and
diplomacy
conquests
and
treaties
discussed
and
settled
this
supreme
question
of
which
grotius
expounded
the
theory
and
ancillon
wrote
the
history
now
we
are
no
longer
in
a
situation
so
simple
what
a
complication
of
ideas
what
ideas
novel
and
start
up
in
these
days
to
embarrass
the
course
and
entangle
the
relations
of
states
the
question
of
races
the
question
of
nationalities
the
question
of
little
states
and
of
great
political
unities
the
question
of
popular
sovereignty
and
of
its
rights
beyond
the
limits
of
nations
as
well
as
in
their
midst
all
these
problems
arise
and
cast
into
the
shade
as
a
routine
which
has
served
its
turn
the
old
public
right
and
the
maxims
of
the
equilibrium
of
europe
in
their
place
seeking
themselves
to
impose
rules
for
regulating
the
territorial
organizations
and
the
external
relations
of
states
xiv
not
that
the
old
traditional
policy
of
europe
does
not
mingle
itself
with
and
exercise
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
new
ideas
and
questions
which
invade
us
however
intellectual
theories
and
ambitions
may
change
the
passions
and
interests
of
men
are
permanent
war
and
the
right
of
conquest
have
made
good
their
old
pretensions
and
this
before
our
very
eyes
without
any
respect
for
the
principle
of
nationalities
and
of
races
a
principle
nevertheless
inscribed
upon
the
very
standards
which
the
conquerors
bore
prussia
has
aggrandized
herself
in
the
name
of
german
unity
and
at
the
very
moment
excluded
from
participating
in
the
common
affairs
of
germany
the
seven
or
eight
millions
of
germans
who
form
part
of
the
empire
of
austria
prussia
seized
the
petty
german
republic
of
frankfort
evidently
against
the
will
of
its
sovereign
people
and
danish
schleswick
does
not
yet
form
part
of
the
political
group
to
the
class
of
which
she
belongs
by
similarity
of
national
origin
and
of
language
even
while
sheltering
themselves
under
the
ægis
of
some
general
idea
selfish
interests
and
rude
violence
have
not
ceased
to
play
a
great
part
in
the
events
which
are
passing
before
us
and
if
the
ambition
of
frederick
the
second
was
not
more
legitimate
it
was
at
least
more
logical
than
that
of
his
successors
xv
i
am
far
from
meaning
to
deny
that
the
new
ideas
which
men
follow
and
the
desires
which
they
evince
contain
a
certain
part
of
truth
or
to
affirm
that
they
have
not
a
right
to
a
certain
share
of
influence
the
identity
of
origin
and
of
race
the
possession
in
common
of
a
single
name
and
of
one
language
have
a
moral
value
very
capable
of
becoming
itself
a
political
force
of
this
fair
and
prudent
statesmanship
is
bound
to
hold
account
but
policy
becomes
chimerical
and
dangerous
when
it
attributes
to
these
new
ideas
and
these
aspirations
a
supreme
authority
and
right
to
dominion
and
what
shocks
all
experience
and
common
sense
is
to
reject
as
out
of
date
and
no
longer
applicable
maxims
which
were
the
foundation
of
the
public
law
of
nations
and
which
up
to
the
present
time
have
presided
over
the
relations
of
states
xvi
the
equilibrium
of
europe
the
long
duration
of
territorial
agglomerations
the
right
of
small
states
to
exist
and
be
independent
the
ancient
titles
to
government
and
the
respect
for
ancient
treaties
all
these
elements
of
european
order
have
not
succumbed
neither
were
they
bound
to
succumb
to
the
theory
of
nationalities
and
the
fashionable
doctrine
of
great
political
unities
what
would
not
be
said
and
what
would
not
be
said
with
justice
if
france
had
proclaimed
that
as
belgium
and
western
switzerland
speak
french
that
as
their
populations
have
both
in
origin
and
manners
great
affinities
with
our
fellow
countrymen
in
french
flanders
and
in
the
principal
of
national
unity
requires
their
incorporation
with
france
prince
metternich
was
wrong
to
say
that
italy
was
a
mere
geographical
expression
there
are
certainly
between
the
nations
of
italy
historical
bonds
both
intellectual
and
moral
which
draw
them
towards
one
another
and
repel
from
their
territories
all
foreign
domination
xvii
but
this
relationship
which
may
and
ought
to
be
a
principle
of
union
did
not
impose
upon
italy
the
form
of
political
unity
and
the
of
a
confederation
of
states
might
have
been
established
in
the
peninsula
and
yet
its
liberation
from
the
foreigner
might
have
been
secured
and
a
satisfaction
might
have
been
procured
along
our
own
frontier
of
the
alps
in
the
interests
of
our
own
security
and
of
that
of
europe
for
the
preservation
of
the
equilibrium
of
power
as
soon
as
we
look
at
the
question
with
serious
attention
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
any
general
application
of
the
principle
of
nationalities
or
of
that
of
the
great
political
unities
would
throw
the
civilized
world
into
such
a
confusion
and
fermentation
as
would
be
equally
compromising
to
the
internal
liberties
of
nations
and
to
the
preservation
of
peace
between
the
different
states
xviii
what
if
i
had
to
sound
the
consequences
of
another
principle
the
sovereign
authority
which
men
also
seek
in
these
days
to
set
up
the
right
i
mean
of
populations
or
of
some
part
of
a
population
to
dissolve
the
state
with
which
they
are
connected
and
to
range
themselves
under
another
state
or
to
constitute
themselves
into
new
and
independent
states
what
would
become
of
the
existence
or
even
of
the
very
name
of
country
if
it
also
were
thus
left
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
fluctuating
wills
of
men
and
the
special
interests
of
such
or
such
of
its
members
there
is
in
the
destiny
of
men
whether
of
generations
or
individuals
a
great
part
which
they
have
no
share
in
deciding
or
disposing
of
a
man
does
not
choose
his
family
neither
does
he
select
his
country
it
is
the
natural
state
of
man
to
live
in
the
place
where
he
is
born
in
the
society
where
is
his
cradle
the
cases
are
infinitely
rare
which
can
permit
of
the
bonds
being
rent
asunder
by
which
man
is
attached
to
the
soil
the
citizen
to
the
state
which
can
justify
his
leaving
the
bosom
of
his
country
to
order
to
separate
himself
from
it
absolutely
and
to
strive
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
country
xix
we
have
just
been
spectators
of
such
an
attempt
we
have
seen
some
of
the
states
which
form
the
nation
of
the
united
states
of
america
abjure
this
union
and
erect
themselves
into
an
independent
confederation
wherefore
in
order
to
maintain
in
their
bosom
the
institution
of
slavery
by
what
right
by
the
right
it
is
said
of
every
people
or
portion
of
a
people
to
change
its
government
at
discretion
the
states
which
remained
faithful
to
the
ancient
american
confederation
denied
the
principle
and
combatted
the
attempt
they
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
federal
union
and
in
abolishing
slavery
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
that
they
had
both
right
and
reason
on
their
side
many
years
before
the
struggle
commenced
one
of
the
most
eminent
men
in
the
united
states
eminent
by
his
character
as
well
as
his
talents
a
faithful
representative
of
the
interests
of
the
states
of
the
south
and
an
avowed
apologist
for
negro
slavery
calhoun
did
me
the
honour
of
transmitting
to
me
all
that
he
had
written
and
said
upon
the
subject
xx
i
was
struck
by
the
frank
and
earnest
language
with
which
he
expressed
his
convictions
but
no
less
by
the
futility
of
the
efforts
which
he
made
to
justify
upon
general
considerations
and
by
historical
necessities
the
fact
of
slavery
in
his
country
he
would
never
have
dared
to
paint
it
in
its
actual
and
living
reality
as
beecher
stowe
has
done
in
her
romances
of
uncle
tom
cabin
and
of
dred
which
have
everywhere
excited
so
much
sympathy
and
emotion
i
became
every
day
more
and
more
convinced
that
there
was
here
a
radical
iniquity
and
a
social
wound
of
which
it
was
at
last
time
to
efface
the
shame
and
to
conjure
the
danger
it
was
with
the
motive
of
maintaining
the
system
of
slavery
that
the
states
of
the
south
undertook
to
break
up
the
great
american
state
which
was
their
country
motive
detestable
for
a
deplorable
act
our
epoch
so
unfortunate
in
many
respects
has
in
my
opinion
been
fortunate
in
this
that
it
produced
a
republic
the
greatest
of
all
republics
of
ancient
or
of
modern
times
which
has
afforded
us
the
example
of
an
uncompromising
resistance
to
an
illegitimate
popular
desire
and
of
an
unflinching
respect
for
the
tutelary
principles
of
the
life
of
states
xxi
so
far
of
the
territorial
questions
and
those
which
concern
the
external
relations
of
nations
let
me
now
speculate
upon
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
those
which
involve
domestic
order
and
the
organization
of
government
i
meet
here
with
the
same
confusion
the
same
complications
the
same
fluctuations
between
ideas
and
essays
incoherent
or
inconsistent
at
the
base
as
at
the
summit
of
society
the
monarchy
and
the
republic
are
in
collision
the
monarchy
reigns
in
events
the
republic
ferments
in
opinions
the
proposition
is
now
universally
received
that
society
has
the
right
not
only
to
see
clearly
and
to
intervene
in
its
own
government
but
to
see
so
clearly
and
to
intervene
in
such
a
manner
as
to
justify
the
expression
that
it
governs
itself
xxii
the
constitutional
monarchy
and
the
republic
profess
each
to
attain
this
object
the
one
by
a
national
representation
by
the
monarch
inviolability
and
his
ministry
responsibility
the
other
by
universal
suffrage
and
the
periodical
elections
of
the
great
representatives
of
public
power
but
neither
the
constitutional
monarchy
nor
the
republic
has
as
yet
succeeded
amongst
us
in
obtaining
firm
possession
of
opinions
and
of
events
of
public
confidence
and
of
durable
power
after
and
in
spite
of
years
of
prosperity
of
peace
and
of
liberty
the
constitutional
power
fell
the
republic
accepted
on
its
sudden
appearance
as
the
form
of
government
which
as
was
affirmed
divided
us
least
after
a
few
months
of
turbulent
and
sterile
anarchy
fell
also
in
the
place
of
the
constitutional
monarchy
and
of
the
republic
there
arose
another
form
of
government
a
mixture
of
dictatorship
and
of
republic
a
sort
of
personal
government
combined
with
universal
suffrage
will
the
essay
have
greater
success
events
will
decide
xxiii
in
the
meantime
let
us
be
sincere
with
ourselves
the
cause
of
so
many
painful
and
abortive
attempts
resides
rather
in
the
disposition
of
the
people
of
france
than
in
the
acts
of
its
governments
our
revolutionary
existence
since
our
ambitious
aspirings
and
disappointments
both
equally
immense
have
left
us
at
once
very
excited
and
very
fatigued
full
of
impatience
at
the
same
time
as
of
incertitude
we
know
not
very
well
what
we
think
or
what
we
would
have
our
ideas
are
perplexed
and
confused
our
wills
vacillating
and
feeble
our
minds
have
no
fixed
points
our
conduct
no
determined
objects
we
often
yield
ourselves
up
readily
against
our
better
judgment
nay
against
our
very
wish
to
whatever
power
extends
its
hand
to
seize
us
but
soon
very
soon
we
evince
towards
that
power
not
a
whit
less
exigency
or
unfairness
as
soon
as
we
feel
ourselves
rid
of
our
most
urgent
cause
for
disquietude
our
discontent
is
as
precipitate
as
was
our
submission
in
the
hour
of
peril
we
are
again
disposed
to
be
quarrelsome
and
demand
instant
action
in
the
midst
even
of
our
doubts
and
hesitation
our
revolutions
have
taught
us
the
lesson
neither
of
resistance
nor
of
patience
yet
these
are
virtues
without
which
it
is
idle
to
propose
to
found
any
free
government
xxiv
i
pass
from
political
questions
to
social
questions
and
from
the
state
of
our
political
institutions
to
that
of
the
relations
existent
between
the
different
parts
of
society
i
say
the
to
avoid
saying
for
we
can
not
hear
the
word
class
pronounced
without
thinking
that
we
are
threatened
with
the
of
privileges
and
exclusions
of
that
entire
with
its
narrow
compartments
and
inseparable
barriers
within
which
men
were
formerly
enclosed
and
ranked
according
to
their
origin
their
name
their
religion
or
whatever
other
factitious
or
accidental
qualification
they
might
possess
in
effect
this
has
fallen
fallen
completely
and
definitively
all
legal
barriers
have
disappeared
all
careers
are
open
all
labour
free
by
individual
merit
and
by
labour
every
man
may
aspire
to
everything
and
examples
abound
in
confirmation
of
the
principle
xxv
this
was
the
great
work
the
great
conquest
of
we
celebrate
it
unceasingly
and
we
have
often
the
air
of
forgetting
that
it
ever
occurred
the
different
ancient
classes
are
still
full
of
jealousy
of
distrust
and
of
restless
irritation
because
they
have
to
struggle
for
influence
in
the
midst
of
liberty
they
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
still
risking
life
and
limb
in
defence
of
their
situation
and
of
their
right
the
restoration
was
attacked
and
undermined
on
account
it
was
said
of
the
evils
that
the
had
to
endure
and
the
risks
which
it
had
to
run
at
the
hands
of
the
nobles
under
the
government
of
july
the
working
classes
were
told
incessantly
that
they
were
the
victims
of
the
privileges
and
of
the
tyranny
of
the
middle
classes
facts
and
actual
events
gave
singularly
the
lie
to
such
assertions
with
what
effect
in
the
hurry
of
passions
and
the
intoxication
of
thought
men
appealed
to
theories
which
had
been
already
often
produced
on
the
stage
of
the
world
theories
which
have
only
served
to
agitate
never
to
satisfy
it
xxvi
landed
property
and
capital
labour
and
wages
the
artificial
distribution
of
the
means
of
material
happiness
amongst
men
have
served
sometimes
as
the
subjects
of
unjust
recrimination
sometimes
of
chimerical
expectations
attacks
were
made
upon
things
which
the
assailants
had
no
right
to
take
and
promises
were
made
to
give
things
which
the
promisers
had
not
the
power
to
give
i
have
heard
it
remarked
by
men
who
are
good
observers
that
this
malady
of
the
mind
is
decreasing
and
that
even
amongst
the
labouring
classes
themselves
false
notions
as
to
the
conflict
of
capital
and
labour
as
to
the
artificial
settlement
of
wages
and
the
intervention
of
the
state
in
the
distribution
of
the
material
means
of
existence
are
in
discredit
and
that
the
ambitious
aspirings
of
the
people
although
continuing
to
be
very
democratic
have
ceased
to
assume
the
form
of
socialism
xxvii
i
ardently
wish
it
were
so
the
passionate
feelings
which
find
their
field
in
facts
affecting
the
sphere
of
material
subsistence
are
the
rudest
the
most
rebellious
and
the
most
recalcitrant
to
the
principles
of
the
moral
order
it
is
easier
to
deal
with
the
aspirings
of
political
ambition
than
with
the
ardent
cravings
for
physical
advantages
but
i
fear
i
confess
that
errors
such
as
those
which
presented
themselves
under
the
names
of
socialism
and
communism
and
which
recently
made
so
much
noise
are
not
so
discarded
as
we
might
hope
them
to
be
that
they
are
actually
without
a
mouthpiece
is
not
a
sufficient
proof
of
their
defeat
materialism
and
the
evil
instincts
to
which
it
leads
or
from
which
it
springs
have
penetrated
very
far
amongst
us
and
a
long
period
of
social
and
moral
progress
in
the
midst
of
a
society
which
has
been
well
ordered
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
surmount
this
danger
several
years
ago
i
put
to
a
great
manufacturer
of
manchester
who
had
been
mayor
of
that
immense
centre
of
industry
the
following
question
what
amongst
you
is
the
proportion
between
the
laborious
and
workmen
who
live
respectably
in
their
homes
set
aside
money
in
the
savings
bank
and
apply
for
books
at
the
people
library
and
the
idle
and
disorderly
workmen
who
pass
their
time
at
taverns
and
only
work
so
much
as
is
necessary
to
furnish
them
with
the
means
of
subsistence
xxviii
after
a
moment
reflection
he
replied
the
former
are
of
the
whole
number
after
congratulating
him
i
added
allow
me
to
put
one
more
question
if
you
had
amongst
you
great
disorders
seditious
assemblages
and
riots
what
would
be
the
result
with
us
sir
he
said
without
hesitation
the
honest
men
are
braver
than
the
ones
i
congratulated
him
this
time
still
more
in
these
questions
i
had
touched
the
root
of
the
evil
which
afflicts
us
it
is
to
their
shortcomings
in
morality
to
their
disorderly
lives
that
we
must
attribute
the
favour
with
which
the
working
classes
receive
the
fallacious
theories
that
menace
social
order
the
condition
of
these
classes
is
hard
and
full
of
distressing
accidents
whoever
regards
it
closely
and
with
a
little
fairness
and
sympathy
can
not
fail
to
be
deeply
moved
by
all
the
sufferings
which
they
have
to
support
the
privations
from
which
they
have
no
chance
of
escape
and
the
efforts
which
they
must
make
to
ensure
themselves
a
living
at
best
monotonous
and
full
of
hazard
xxix
the
happy
ones
of
the
earth
feel
sometimes
alarm
and
irritation
when
they
hear
from
the
pulpit
descriptions
purer
and
more
true
to
the
life
than
are
to
be
met
with
in
philanthropical
novels
of
the
precarious
state
and
distresses
of
the
lower
orders
beyond
doubt
from
pictures
of
this
nature
should
be
scrupulously
excluded
everything
that
would
seem
to
excite
sentiments
of
hostility
or
that
would
set
one
class
against
another
still
as
the
upper
classes
must
resign
themselves
to
the
spectacle
it
devolves
more
especially
upon
christian
painters
to
place
it
before
them
xxx
nothing
but
strong
moral
convictions
and
the
habits
of
well
living
amongst
the
labouring
classes
can
furnish
them
with
efficacious
means
of
struggling
against
the
temptations
and
resisting
the
ambitious
yearnings
suggested
to
them
by
the
spectacle
of
the
world
which
surrounds
them
a
world
now
at
length
transparent
to
all
a
world
of
which
the
stir
the
noise
the
accidents
the
adventures
penetrate
with
rapidity
even
to
the
workshops
of
our
cities
and
the
remotest
recesses
of
our
villages
what
influence
shall
protect
the
masses
of
the
people
from
the
irritating
and
demoralizing
effect
of
such
a
sight
unless
it
be
the
influence
of
religious
principles
the
moral
discipline
which
religion
maintains
and
the
moral
serenity
which
religion
diffuses
over
the
rudest
existences
and
the
lives
subjected
to
the
greatest
privations
and
it
is
precisely
religious
belief
and
religious
discipline
christian
faith
and
christian
law
which
are
now
being
attacked
and
undermined
and
this
far
more
in
the
obscurer
classes
than
in
the
brilliant
regions
of
society
xxxi
these
attacks
are
of
a
general
although
of
diverse
nature
and
of
unequal
violence
they
occur
in
the
bosom
of
roman
catholicism
of
protestantism
and
of
scientific
philosophy
some
are
direct
open
impetuous
others
indirect
and
full
of
reserves
and
of
a
tenderness
sometimes
affected
sometimes
sincere
christianity
counts
amongst
its
enemies
fanatics
who
persecute
it
in
the
name
of
reason
and
of
liberty
as
well
as
adversaries
who
criticise
it
with
moderation
and
prudence
the
latter
admit
its
practical
deservings
are
distressed
by
the
wounds
which
they
inflict
and
in
the
very
act
of
dealing
their
blows
seek
to
lessen
their
force
this
diversity
of
attack
is
a
proof
of
the
trouble
of
the
incertitude
and
of
the
incoherence
which
reign
in
opinions
both
upon
religious
questions
and
upon
questions
which
are
only
simply
political
and
social
many
they
are
who
would
be
inclined
to
save
such
or
such
a
portion
of
the
edifice
which
they
are
battering
and
seeking
to
destroy
but
the
upshot
is
that
all
these
blows
are
telling
upon
the
same
point
and
are
concurring
to
produce
the
same
effect
it
is
the
christian
religion
which
receives
them
all
it
is
the
right
and
the
empire
of
christ
which
in
the
world
learned
and
unlearned
is
subjected
to
doubt
and
exposed
to
peril
xxxii
i
have
touched
upon
all
the
great
questions
which
are
agitating
the
human
mind
and
human
societies
questions
of
public
right
questions
of
political
organization
questions
of
social
institutions
questions
of
religious
belief
everywhere
i
encounter
two
facts
facts
everywhere
the
same
a
great
complication
and
a
great
incertitude
in
man
opinions
and
in
his
efforts
nothing
is
simple
no
one
decided
problems
of
every
kind
doubts
of
every
kind
weigh
upon
the
thoughts
of
men
and
oppress
their
wills
their
ambitious
aspirings
are
varied
immense
but
everywhere
they
hesitate
they
may
be
likened
to
travellers
already
exhausted
with
fatigue
yet
feebly
driving
to
feel
their
way
through
a
labyrinth
are
we
then
to
infer
that
we
are
living
in
an
era
of
decay
and
impotence
that
we
have
nothing
ourselves
to
do
nothing
to
hope
for
in
this
situation
so
complicated
and
so
obscure
that
we
have
only
to
wait
until
our
lot
is
decided
by
that
sovereign
power
called
by
some
providence
by
others
fate
xxxiii
i
am
far
from
thinking
so
of
the
men
distinguished
by
singleness
of
views
and
strength
of
convictions
whom
i
have
known
i
consider
the
marshal
gouvion
in
these
respects
the
most
remarkable
he
was
one
day
detailing
his
reasons
for
disapproving
of
the
system
of
a
royal
or
imperial
guard
or
of
privileged
corps
in
an
army
few
said
he
are
really
brave
the
best
thing
to
be
done
is
to
disseminate
them
in
the
ranks
where
each
singly
by
his
presence
and
example
will
make
eight
or
ten
more
brave
men
around
him
i
am
no
judge
as
to
the
value
of
the
marshal
maxim
in
a
military
sense
i
do
not
believe
it
to
be
invariably
true
or
always
applicable
in
the
political
sense
there
are
epochs
at
which
in
order
to
further
the
progress
of
which
a
nation
stands
in
need
to
withdraw
it
from
its
embarrassments
or
to
rouse
it
from
its
apathy
the
most
urgent
thing
to
be
done
and
the
plan
the
most
efficacious
is
to
form
in
its
bosom
picked
bodies
of
men
the
number
is
immaterial
and
then
to
incorporate
with
them
others
possessing
distinguished
qualities
and
animated
by
the
same
spirit
decided
in
their
opinions
and
resolute
in
their
action
single
of
purpose
and
full
of
confidence
these
would
soon
attract
to
themselves
as
associates
many
others
who
would
never
without
such
impulse
begin
to
move
in
the
same
path
xxxiv
we
are
i
believe
at
an
era
which
calls
for
such
a
mode
of
influencing
society
and
which
authorises
us
to
expect
success
if
we
adopt
it
i
can
never
be
accused
of
ignoring
or
extenuating
the
evil
which
torments
us
upon
all
the
points
which
i
have
just
indicated
the
rights
of
nations
the
civil
organization
of
society
and
its
economy
moral
and
religious
belief
in
all
these
directions
an
evil
wind
is
blowing
an
evil
current
is
hurrying
away
a
part
of
french
society
and
it
is
my
constant
design
so
to
arouse
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
and
its
good
sense
as
to
make
them
attentive
to
the
existence
of
the
ill
and
solicitous
for
its
removal
xxxv
but
at
the
side
of
this
fact
so
deplorable
and
so
full
of
peril
a
fact
of
contrary
and
salutary
nature
is
occurring
and
developing
itself
a
good
wind
there
also
is
which
is
blowing
a
good
current
which
is
impelling
us
forwards
at
the
same
time
that
violent
and
revolutionary
theories
are
being
diffused
the
principles
of
legal
order
and
of
liberties
serving
mutually
to
control
and
check
one
another
are
proclaimed
and
maintained
the
maxims
and
the
sentiments
of
the
spirit
of
peace
are
heard
at
least
as
loudly
pronounced

in

matter

the
good

of

the
life
of
nations
is
neither
easier
nor

mixed
with
good

assuredly
in

what

in

of
its
sorrows
the

what
in

object
can

to
be
the
conduct
of

men
who
have
it
at

to
second
the
good
current
and
to
stem
the
evil
current
which
have
both
set
in

we

free

the
two

i
have
no
intention
here
to
speak
of
political
liberties
in
the
abstract
and
of
their
necessity
either
to
a
country
in
order
to
guarantee
to
it
a

to

the

footnote
it
is
solely
because
of
its
influence
upon
that
ill
of
our
epoch
the
complication
of
questions
and
the
hesitations
of
opinion
that
i
speak
here
of
political
liberty
i
regard
it
as
one
of
the
two
great
remedies
against
this

of

february
xl
when
all
questions
are
agitated
pell
mell
and
all
minds
are
perplexed
the
first
salutary
result
consequent
upon
liberty
is
that
it
sets
all
opinions
and
all
intentions
in
contact
and
in
conflict
at
first
and
for
a
time
this
simultaneous
invasion
of
so
many
complex
facts
and
of
so
many
diverse
and
contrary
ideas
does
but
add
to
the
perplexity
of
the
questions
and
to
the
confusion
of
minds
but
little
by
little
and
quickly
too
provided
liberty
endures
the
winnowing
process
produces
its
effect
upon
the
questions
and
light
penetrates
into
the
understandings
the
different
facts
and
problems
which
these
facts
suggest
are
set
in
turn
in
their
place
and
valued
only
for
as
much
as
they
are
worth
actors
and
spectators
grow
accustomed
to
them
all
and
begin
to
form
more
precise
conceptions
of
them
little
by
little
order
takes
the
place
of
confusion
opinions
define
and
classify
themselves
and
instead
of
the
fermentation
of
opinions
in
a
chaotic
confusion
we
have
a
contest
in
regular
form
and
upon
intelligible
issues
i
repeat
that
a
result
so
salutary
can
not
be
obtained
unless
upon
the
condition
of
a
liberty
universal
real
and
durable
partial
or
transitory
it
would
serve
only
to
aggravate
the
perturbation
and
to
unsettle
opinions
still
more
xli
political
liberty
has
a
second
effect
one
perhaps
still
more
important
it
forces
all
questions
to
submit
to
the
test
of
practical
experiment
as
long
as
the
liberty
is
only
in
the
thought
it
is
vain
and
intemperate
everything
seems
permitted
and
everything
possible
to
those
who
are
not
responsible
for
the
effects
of
an
act
man
thought
intoxicated
with
itself
runs
riot
in
the
vagueness
of
infinite
space
and
time
but
when
to
liberty
of
thought
is
superadded
political
liberty
when
instead
of
treating
questions
speculatively
they
have
to
be
virtually
solved
when
men
are
charged
as
real
actors
to
transform
into
facts
their
own
opinions
or
those
of
the
spectators
who
are
looking
on
then
it
is
that
the
human
mind
making
its
own
strength
the
object
of
its
reflection
and
examination
is
driven
to
the
admission
that
it
does
not
dispose
at
its
own
will
of
the
world
and
that
even
in
order
to
satisfy
itself
it
must
confine
itself
to
the
limits
imposed
by
good
sense
by
justice
and
by
possibility
then
it
is
that
it
learns
to
govern
itself
and
to
hold
itself
responsible
for
its
acts
responsibility
engenders
discretion
but
is
itself
engendered
by
liberty
alone
xlii
our
own
times
have
furnished
us
with
three
great
examples
of
the
salutary
empire
exercised
by
political
liberty
in
furnishing
an
escape
from
the
embarrassment
of
situations
and
in
solving
questions
the
most
different
i
might
say
the
most
contrary
in
their
nature
we
have
only
to
cast
our
eyes
over
the
contemporary
histories
of
england
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
of
france
herself
to
discover
their
examples
and
their
authority
as
precedents
from
to
england
was
engaged
in
struggles
first
against
the
spirit
of
revolution
and
then
against
that
termed
by
benjamin
constant
the
spirit
of
usurpation
and
of
conquest
with
what
forces
and
with
what
arms
did
england
support
these
two
formidable
struggles
with
the
forces
and
the
arms
of
political
liberty
xliii
it
was
by
the
elections
by
publicity
by
discussions
continued
in
the
midst
of
the
energetic
manifestations
of
all
the
parties
it
was
by
appeals
to
public
sentiments
and
opinions
it
was
by
setting
in
action
all
the
springs
of
a
free
and
representative
government
that
england
succeeded
in
her
resistance
to
the
most
potent
revolutionary
and
military
movement
which
ever
agitated
europe
that
struggle
over
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
during
which
the
presiding
policy
prolonged
its
tenure
of
office
by
pursuing
a
pacific
course
england
entered
upon
quite
a
different
path
sometimes
under
the
government
of
liberals
sometimes
of
conservatives
the
policy
of
reform
took
the
place
of
the
policy
of
resistance
and
since
it
is
in
this
path
that
england
is
progressing
it
is
in
favour
of
innovations
sometimes
prudent
sometimes
daring
and
sometimes
perhaps
improvident
that
she
is
exerting
to
the
utmost
all
the
forces
of
the
country
all
the
strength
of
its
government
political
liberty
has
in
turn
and
with
similar
efficacy
served
the
cause
and
assured
the
success
at
one
time
of
a
policy
of
resistance
at
another
of
that
of
progress
xliv
the
united
states
of
america
have
been
subjected
to
a
still
ruder
trial
their
government
has
had
to
struggle
against
the
insurrection
of
a
notable
portion
of
their
people
and
against
a
civil
war
entered
upon
in
the
name
of
a
principle
popular
independence
the
central
power
of
the
confederation
has
resisted
an
insurrection
radically
illegitimate
which
was
entered
upon
to
maintain
the
slavery
of
a
part
of
the
human
race
it
defended
the
national
existence
of
the
state
against
the
attempts
which
were
made
to
dislocate
it
and
which
were
founded
upon
the
same
motive
and
after
a
civil
war
which
endured
four
years
in
the
course
of
which
each
side
was
prodigal
of
efforts
and
sacrifices
and
displayed
an
equal
energy
the
policy
of
resistance
triumphed
by
the
medium
of
a
republican
power
and
the
liberal
idea
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
vanquished
the
revolutionary
idea
of
the
right
of
insurrection
xlv
it
is
to
political
liberty
and
to
the
potent
force
of
the
institutions
and
manners
founded
under
her
influence
that
this
victory
of
the
great
right
of
humanity
was
due
and
the
war
once
over
the
civil
of
american
society
resumed
its
action
still
stormy
and
perilous
but
free
from
every
anarchical
usurpation
or
military
tyranny
newer
to
france
its
principles
less
understood
by
it
and
not
so
well
applied
political
liberty
has
not
on
these
accounts
remained
without
producing
there
some
fruits
in
and
in
france
passed
through
two
revolutions
one
of
which
had
been
preceded
by
sixteen
the
other
by
eighteen
years
of
civil
liberty
neither
of
the
in
operation
immediately
previous
to
each
revolution
sufficed
to
prevent
it
but
they
greatly
changed
its
character
and
weakened
its
effects
in
thanks
to
the
instantaneous
intervention
of
the
public
authorities
which
owed
their
existence
to
the
previous
a
regular
government
was
promptly
established
and
a
new
constitutional
monarchy
succeeded
to
that
which
had
just
fallen
xlvi
on
the
instant
it
set
itself
in
opposition
to
the
revolutionary
movement
which
had
given
it
birth
but
the
principle
of
respect
for
the
law
and
for
liberty
exercised
as
yet
so
incomplete
and
feeble
an
empire
upon
men
minds
that
the
anarchical
fermentation
of
opinions
prolonged
themselves
even
after
the
victory
the
doctrine
of
religious
liberty
in
particular
was
more
than
once
lost
sight
of
and
violated
in
february
the
funeral
ceremonies
in
the
church
of
saint
germain
celebrated
in
commemoration
of
the
duke
de
berri
who
had
been
assassinated
eleven
years
previously
was
not
allowed
to
be
tranquilly
celebrated
a
violent
and
riotous
mob
sacked
the
archiepiscopal
palace
of
paris
and
was
the
cause
of
the
church
which
had
furnished
them
with
a
pretext
for
violence
being
closed
for
many
months
xlvii
in
on
the
contrary
during
a
revolutionary
crisis
which
set
men
passions
far
more
furiously
in
movement
and
which
was
more
profound
than
that
of
neither
the
liberty
of
religion
nor
the
peace
of
the
churches
was
disturbed
the
ruling
authorities
were
exposed
to
anarchy
for
a
longer
period
but
the
rights
of
the
individual
were
respected
and
he
might
affirm
himself
free
even
in
the
midst
of
the
public
troubles
and
perils
years
of
civil
liberty
have
not
disappeared
with
the
governments
which
were
then
in
force
without
leaving
their
traces
their
traditions
and
their
examples
have
evidently
exercised
a
salutary
influence
both
upon
the
last
revolution
and
upon
the
reaction
which
put
an
end
to
it
that
this
influence
may
still
surmount
the
great
trials
through
which
governments
and
people
may
have
both
to
pass
two
things
are
necessary
the
one
is
that
civil
liberty
should
form
real
citizens
that
nations
as
well
as
governments
should
learn
to
make
use
of
their
rights
and
to
submit
to
the
limits
imposed
by
their
laws
the
other
is
that
each
country
and
ruling
power
at
the
same
time
that
they
are
culling
the
fruits
of
civil
liberty
should
accept
its
inconveniences
and
its
perils
xlviii
a
free
government
is
not
exempt
from
either
vices
or
dangers
it
does
not
dispense
men
from
the
necessity
of
contemplating
with
resignation
the
imperfection
of
every
work
of
man
as
well
as
of
every
human
situation
free
institutions
are
not
of
themselves
enough
they
leave
room
to
nations
for
what
do
i
say
they
demand
from
them
great
activity
and
much
responsibility
if
nations
strive
to
elude
their
part
of
responsibility
and
omit
to
exercise
their
share
of
action
free
institutions
become
idle
words
they
are
no
longer
anything
but
a
without
the
picture
a
drama
written
not
represented
in
which
the
actors
fail
to
assume
their
parts
or
to
to
produce
the
it
is
the
absolute
necessity
of
this
of
the
public
in
the
life
of
free
government
which
gives
so
capital
an
importance
to
the
popular
beliefs
moral
and
religious
xlix
when
i
say
beliefs
moral
and
religious
i
attach
to
the
word
a
sense
at
once
the
largest
and
most
positive
these
beliefs
may
have
different
dogmas
and
different
internal
organizations
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
believe
that
romanists
are
necessarily
hostile
to
civil
liberty
or
that
the
doctrine
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
impels
protestants
inevitably
to
anarchy
what
is
indispensable
is
that
in
their
diversity
the
beliefs
styled
moral
and
religious
should
be
beliefs
really
moral
and
religious
beliefs
which
recognize
and
attest
that
man
is
naturally
moral
and
religious
and
which
assign
to
man
something
essentially
to
distinguish
him
from
the
material
world
in
the
midst
of
which
he
lives
in
short
a
soul
nations
animated
by
such
beliefs
are
the
only
ones
which
accept
really
under
a
free
a
large
share
both
of
its
responsibility
and
of
its
active
duties
it
is
only
when
so
animated
that
they
give
consequently
to
civil
liberty
the
potent
support
of
which
it
stands
in
need
for
it
is
only
then
that
they
seriously
believe
in
the
existence
of
moral
liberty
the
world
has
seen
more
than
once
how
feeble
and
precarious
an
affection
men
feel
for
liberty
when
they
no
longer
believe
in
the
human
soul
and
with
what
a
tame
complacency
when
they
regard
themselves
as
an
ephemeral
combination
of
material
elements
they
submit
to
the
empire
of
the
material
forces
which
assail
them
l
many
in
these
days
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
enough
in
a
free
country
if
religious
beliefs
are
freely
practised
by
those
who
profess
them
and
externally
respected
by
others
and
that
all
which
can
be
expected
from
them
is
an
indirect
influence
in
favour
of
the
maintenance
of
order
but
this
is
a
complete
misapprehension
of
the
great
facts
of
nature
and
of
human
society
there
are
two
things
which
never
fail
finally
to
prove
incompatible
liberty
and
falsehood
whether
from
prudence
or
in
tenderness
for
the
opinions
of
those
who
surround
him
a
man
isolated
in
position
may
preserve
silence
or
may
utter
even
a
falsehood
as
to
what
he
thinks
and
believes
respecting
the
supreme
questions
concerning
man
nature
and
man
destiny
this
is
possible
for
such
cases
are
seen
a
single
isolated
individual
is
so
paltry
a
thing
and
passes
so
quickly
that
his
silence
or
his
falsehood
can
exercise
but
little
influence
upon
the
vast
ocean
of
society
in
which
he
is
plunged
but
the
falsehood
or
the
silence
of
a
free
people
from
feelings
of
respect
or
of
prudence
can

their
opinions
and
their
sentiments
concerning
the
supreme
questions
of
humanity
manifest
themselves
necessarily
and
carry
with
them
in
such
manifestation
their
natural
and
logical
consequences
li
to
engage
a
free
people

with

and

to
refrain
from
contesting
perhaps
even
to
reduce
to
practice
moral
and
religious
beliefs
in
which
it
does
not
itself
believe
is
to
give
to
it
not
only
a
very
discreditable
but
a
very
impracticable
counsel
liberty
in
the
domain
of
civil
society
calls
for
and
infallibly
induces
veracity
in
the
region
of
the
intellect
a
free
country
can
never
escape
in
its
public
and
practical
life
from
the
effectual
influence
of
any
ideas
whether
moral
or
immoral
religious
or
irreligious
which
may
happen
to
be
fermenting
and
spreading
themselves
abroad
in
the
minds
of
the
people
lii
i
leave
generalities
and
call
things
by
their
proper
names
in
all
that
i
have
just
said
respecting
beliefs
moral
and
religious
it
is
of
christianity
that
i
am
thinking
that
christianity
on
the
one
hand
is
necessary
to
the
firm
establishment
of
civil
liberty
amongst
us
and
on
the
other
hand
is
very
reconcilable
with
the
principles
and
the
rights
of
modern
society
is
what
i
have
at
heart
to
establish
in
the
series
of
meditations
which
i
am
now
publishing
i
do
not
deceive
myself
by
imagining
that
it
will
be
an
easy
task
to
effect
this
reconciliation
and
to
restore
at
the
present
day
to
christianity
the
object
of
so
many
attacks
that
influence
of
which
the
interests
most
dear
to
us
liberty
as
well
as
order
stand
equally
in
need
still
i
believe
that
success
is
not
only
here
possible
but
infallible
i
was
speaking
just
now
of
two
contrary
currents
which
had
set
in
in
the
domain
of
intellect
as
well
as
of
politics
and
which
lead
to
the
formation
of
groups
profoundly
different
conservatives
and
revolutionists
liberals
and
radicals
spiritualists
and
materialists
christians
and
disbelievers
liii
no
one
of
these
groups
really
represents
a
dominant
party
in
france
amidst
them
and
around
them
there
is
a
scattered
and
hesitating
population
sometimes
heedless
sometimes
anxious
vacillating
alternately
between
innovations
and
its
traditions
wearied
of
its
agitations
and
of
its
doubt
and
not
seeing
clearly
the
quarter
from
which
shall
come
that
government
of
truth
of
liberty
and
of
order
which
is
to
give
repose
to
thoughts
and
life
and
enable
him
again
to
rise
in
this
confused
and
wavering
multitude
there
are
to
be
found
men
whose
ways
of
thinking
whose
desires
and
sometimes
whose
tastes
are
to
appearance
very
decided
but
whose
opinions
or
wills
are
in
reality
neither
clear
determined
nor
pronounced
we
have
here
a
vast
field
open
to
all
the
winds
accessible
to
every
labourer
a
field
ever
fertile
and
although
harassed
by
various
and
incoherent
attempts
still
a
field
only
demanding
good
seed
to
bear
an
abundant
harvest
if
we
sound
the
depths
of
french
society
in
all
directions
and
study
it
in
all
its
elements
and
under
all
its
aspects
we
shall
find
it
to
be
as
i
have
here
described
it
liv
above
and
below
in
all
classes
and
parties
amongst
the
powerful
and
the
humble
the
learned
and
ignorant
we
shall
find
everywhere
on
one
side
groups
of
persons
of
resolute
purposes
devoting
their
activity
to
the
service
of
opinions
and
causes
the
most
contrary
on
the
other
a
wavering
vacillating
crowd
in
search
of
a
path
to
follow
and
impelled
perhaps
in
the
most
different
directions
upon
this
population
it
is
that
we
must
act
it
is
amongst
them
that
there
are
immense
and
decisive
conquests
to
make
good
aspirations
moral
and
religious
instincts
those
necessary
preliminaries
to
faith
in
christ
are
by
no
means
wanting
but
to
conduct
them
to
their
goal
to
transform
them
into
positive
and
effectual
convictions
we
must
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
general
character
of
this
population
we
must
be
of
our
time
and
speak
its
language
an
adequate
satisfaction
must
be
offered
and
a
necessary
confidence
must
be
inspired
before
we
can
expect
that
a
population
anxious
to
ensure
the
rights
and
the
interests
of
its
new
life
should
give
in
return
its
soul
lv
it
is
not
a
complacent
indulgence
that
i
am
counselling
it
is
not
concessions
that
i
ask
from
the
contemporary
defenders
of
christianity
what
their
mission
demands
is
that
they
should
know
that
they
should
comprehend
that
they
should
love
the
society
to
which
they
are
addressing
themselves
and
that
they
should
zealously
occupy
themselves
with
it
to
rally
it
under
their
banner
not
to
cast
it
prostrate
or
to
humiliate
it
under
their
blows
not
only
must
their
work
have
this
character
but
when
it
has
it
prospers
and
the
nineteenth
century
has
seen
instances
of
such
success
i
shall
only
cite
two
which
occurred
at
different
epochs
and
in
which
the
modes
of
action
were
different
why
did
chateaubriand
and
the
father
lacordaire
exercise
upon
their
times
and
especially
upon
the
youth
of
their
times
so
extraordinary
an
influence
lvi
first
because
the
awakening
of
christianity
which
they
provoked
was
a
thing
in
harmony
with
the
popular
instincts
but
also
because
in
the
midst
of
the
religious
reaction
of
which
they
were
the
organs
they
each
of
them
by
degrees
and
by
different
processes
respectively
inspired
the
france
of
their
days
with
the
sentiment
that
they
were
its
children
and
its
friends
that
they
shared
its
new
aspirations
that
they
accepted
its
political
transformation
and
that
it
was
not
in
order
to
reconstitute
it
on
its
ancient
basis
that
they
wished
it
to
be
christian
they
more
than
once
astounded
disquieted
even
shocked
their
country
the
one
by
his
political
career
the
other
by
his
monastic
zeal
still
their
popularity
continued
and
they
influenced
it
the
one
by
causing
christianity
to
resume
her
place
in
the
modern
literatures
of
france
the
other
notwithstanding
his
having
in
france
the
monastic
orders
the
reason
of
this
is
that
in
spite
of
the
prejudices
which
it
entertained
against
them
and
the
opinions
in
which
it
differed
from
them
france
felt
itself
understood
and
honoured
by
them
it
rejoiced
in
their
glory
because
it
believed
in
their
sympathy
lvii
men
such
as
de
chateaubriand
and
the
father
lacordaire
are
rare
but
the
spirit
which
animated
them
the
comprehension
of
their
age
and
country
which
distinguished
them
did
not
die
with
them
nor
are
they
without
successors
in
their
work
of
religion
and
patriotism
beyond
a
doubt
the
faith
of
christ
and
the
church
of
rome
have
in
our
days
had
no
champion
more
eloquent
and
more
liberal
than
de
montalembert
and
worthily
the
father
hyacinthe
occupies
the
pulpit
from
which
once
resounded
the
voice
of
the
father
lacordaire
at
the
side
of
these
names
already
more
than
once
cited
by
me
i
see
others
start
up
of
a
different
origin
and
with
a
different
physiognomy
but
devoted
to
the
same
cause
and
to
the
same
work
lviii
at
the
very
moment
at
which
i
am
terminating
these
meditations
two
compositions
meet
my
eye
published
by
men
neither
of
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
know
men
very
different
in
position
and
in
ideas
the
one
a
romanist
the
other
a
protestant
the
one
a
great
prelate
in
his
church
the
other
a
simple
pastor
in
his
both
firm
christians
and
both
sympathizers
with
the
instincts
the
aspirations
and
the
moral
and
intellectual
ideas
prevalent
in
the
present
state
of
french
society
both
having
the
resolution
and
the
ability
required
in
order
to
present
christianity
to
frenchmen
under
the
form
and
in
the
language
most
proper
to
make
it
penetrate
the
soul
the
one
is
monseigneur
darboy
the
archbishop
of
paris
the
other
decoppel
pastor
at
alais
the
former
has
just
addressed
to
the
clergy
of
his
diocese
lent
pastoral
letter
upon
the
truth

on
the
of

pastoral
letter
was
published
at

of
february

this
report
was
published
at
toulouse
by
the
society
for
the
publication
of
religious
books
lix
i
was
struck
in
spite
of
their
diversity
by
the
substantially
analogous
character
of
these
two
documents
and
i
cite
them
here
because
i
would
set
in
a
clear
light
the
great
fact
which
each
reveals
that
a
general
and
contemporaneous
work
is
now
being
prosecuted
in
order
to
maintain
and
reestablish
the
harmony
between
the
christianity
of
former
ages
and
the
spirit
of
the
present
century
a
work
of
which
the
mission
is
to
solve
as
far
as
the
solution
can
rest
with
man
the
question
whether
our
epoch
is
christian
religion
says
the
archbishop
of
paris
is
a
fact
that
was
contemporary
with
primitive
man
a
fact
present
in
all
ages
ever
paramount
ever
visible
although
not
everywhere
to
the
same
degree
never
was
there
wanting
in
the
world
a
voice
to
remind
man
of
the
truths
of
religion
whether
it
proceeded
from
the
tent
of
the
patriarch
the
synagogue
of
the
jew
or
the
church
of
the
catholic
whether
it
was
heard
in
the
whisperings
of
a
simple
and
upright
conscience
or
emanated
from
legislators
or
prophet
raised
up
by
heaven
or
was
the
voice
of
god
himself
incarnate
constituting
himself
the
preceptor
and
the
model
of
his
creatures
humanity
was
never
so
imperfect
as
that
these
lofty
lessons
did
not
draw
forth
from
the
generously
faithful
responses
more
or
less
unanimous
lx
heathen
nations
their
history
proves
it
have
preserved
something
of
these
hopes
and
of
the
religious
dogmas
connected
with
them
the
grandsons
of
noah
in
dispersing
in
the
plains
of
sennaar
convey
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
the
traditions
which
they
received
from
their
grandsire
and
which
are
the
common
patrimony
of
the
human
race
doubtless
these
traditions
are
gradually
altered
and
deformed
by
the
vain
intermixtures
of
fables
which
owe
their
origin
to
the
dreamers
of
the
far
east
and
to
the
poets
of
greece
and
of
rome
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
and
particularly
of
those
who
are
its
superiors
and
its
governors
the
grand
features
of
the
truth
are
readily
distinguishable
thus
the
existence
of
god
and
the
action
of
providence
the
distinction
of
good
and
of
evil
the
original
fall
of
man
and
the
necessity
for
an
atonement
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
rewards
and
punishments
of
another
life
all
these
doctrines
more
or
less
disfigured
it
is
true
live
in
the
depths
of
the
conscience
of
the
people
lxi
even
pagans
have
their
souls
by
nature
christian
which
testify
in
favour
of
justice
and
virtue
and
if
pagans
are
to
be
condemned
says
paul
it
is
not
for
having
ignored
god
but
for
having
neglected
to
serve
him
and
to
glorify
him
at
an
era
nearer
to
ourselves
three
centuries
ago
a
sorrowful
work
was
accomplished
theological
disputes
led
to
religious
wars
and
by
a
tearing
asunder
of
ties
which
it
is
impossible
too
much
to
deplore
europe
divided
itself
into
catholics
and
protestants
but
in
spite
of
this
fatal
resolution
it
remained
christian
although
not
in
the
same
degree
their
political
charters
and
institutions
their
civil
laws
and
social
habits
breathe
all
of
christianity
and
the
character
of
their
baptism
remains
stamped
upon
their
foreheads
which
it
for
ever
ennobles
lxii
and
now
this
fact
which
is
the
common
work
of
so
many
generations
made
up
of
beliefs
expressed
in
every
kind
of
manner
and
sometimes
practised
even
to
heroism
written
in
books
sacred
and
profane
engraved
on
marble
and
on
brass
in
institutions
and
in
laws
in
the
mind
and
in
the
heart
of
nations
this
fact
what
is
its
moral
value
and
what
its
bearing
are
we
to
be
told
that
it
is
purely
natural
the
spontaneous
production
of
our
habits
the
simple
result
of
our
instincts
and
so
to
say
an
irrepressible
necessity
of
mankind
even
in
this
case
it
is
divine
as
divine
as
our
nature
itself
which
was
directly
created
by
god
and
so
we
must
recognise
and
respect
religion
as
a
thing
true
necessary
and
divine
it
is
reason
it
is
common
sense
which
tells
us
this
but
there
is
more
than
that
my
very
dear
brethren
this
fact
as
it
presents
itself
so
general
and
so
constant
is
not
merely
the
common
work
of
the
races
of
mankind
our
nature
left
to
its
own
resources
and
its
proper
energy
is
incapable
of
producing
it
and
of
continuing
it
with
a
brilliancy
that
so
endures
and
with
a
force
which
renews
itself
every
day
lxiii
it
is
also
it
is
more
especially
the
providential
and
prodigious
effect
of
a
cause
to
which
all
of
us
are
subject
men
and
nations
and
which
here
shows
itself
that
it
is
so
by
giving
to
its
effects
a
supernatural
character
supernatural
means
were
necessary
that
is
to
say
a
continual
action
of
god
always
in
relation
to
the
varying
exigencies
of
each
different
age
and
the
constant
requirements
of
humanity
in
order
that
the
person
of
the
revealer
having
disappeared
and
his
direct
action
being
no
longer
visible
his
teachings
his
spirit
and
his
institutions
should
be
maintained
in
the
world
in
a
manner
authentic
infallible
and
triumphant
in
a
single
word
there
was
necessary
a
perpetual
assistance
of
god
accrediting
the
mission
of
his
envoys
by
extraordinary
facts
facts
of
a
superhuman
power
miraculously
protecting
their
work
against
the
consequences
of
the
weaknesses
of
some
and
of
the
perversity
of
others
intervening
with
supernatural
to
enable
the
mission
to
develop
itself
amongst
nations
incessantly
to
act
more
and
more
efficaciously
upon
them
in
spite
of
their
shortcomings
and
their
revolts
and
to
aid
them
and
to
support
them
in
their
religious
and
predestined
course
lxiv
this
paramount
action
this
divine
action
is
manifested
in
the
highest
degree
in
religion
after
the
miracles
and
the
prophecies
of
ancient
times
after
the
jewish
nation
whose
history
is
a
prophecy
and
one
unceasing
miracle
christianity
appears
with
signs
so
supernatural
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
deceive
ourselves
miraculous
agency
appears
at
every
turn
the
saviour
and
what
he
affirms
concerning
himself
his
discourses
his
character
and
his
actions
the
difficulties
of
his
undertaking
the
marvels
of
wisdom
and
sanctity
which
he
accomplished
finally
the
survival
and
the
development
of
his
work
through
centuries
everything
here
forces
us
to
recur
to
the
fact
of
the
direct
intervention
of
god
sole
possible
means
of
finding
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
such
grand
results

thus
associated
with
the
whole
life
of
the
human
race
the
principle
of
the
supernatural
and
miraculous
as
well
as
the
dogmas
of
christianity
proclaimed
aloud
but
without
controversy
without
any
appeal
made
to
any
external
or
exclusive
dominion
homage
rendered
to
the
right
of
the
conscience
simple
and
upright
at
the
same
time
as
to
the
biblical
traditions
and
to
the
authority
of
the
church
when
i
affirm
that
all
this
is
here
am
i
not
justified
in
also
affirming
that
christianity
is
here
presented
under
an
aspect
the
least
likely
to
shock
opponents
the
most
proper
to
rally
the
minds
of
the
hesitating
is
it
not
in
effect
on
the
part
of
a
prince
of
the
church
of
rome
the
acceptance
and
pursuit
of
that
great
work
of
harmony
between
the
christian
religion
and
modern
society
which
is
manifesting
itself
in
so
many
analogous
manners
and
under
banners
so
very
diverse
lxvii
the
pastor
of
alais
chooses
a
subject
more
limited
but
is
more
vivid
in
thought
and
more
incisive
in
manner
than
the
archbishop
of
paris
it
is
not
the
general
history
of
christianity
which
he
traces
it
is
its
actual
state
its
religious
bias
and
requirements
in
the
nineteenth
century
which
he
observes
and
describes
his
report
is
no
work
of
philosophy
but
is
penetrated
and
animated
throughout
by
a
real
liberalism
he
does
not
go
in
search
of
polemics
on
the
contrary
he
recommends
little
use
to
be
made
of
them
but
when
the
occasion
or
the
necessity
is
there
he
does
not
evade
it
but
enters
upon
the
arena
unhesitatingly
and
without
compromise
there
are
he
says
exigencies
upon
which
all
men
concur
in
insisting
and
these
depend
upon
the
general
state
of
men
minds
in
our
epoch
each
age
has
its
ideas
and
its
sentiments
its
prejudices
and
its
doubts
a
certain
moral
physiognomy
which
the
preacher
encounters
more
or
less
in
our
congregations
lxviii
our
auditors
perhaps
we
are
too
prone
to
forget
this
do
not
live
isolated
from
their
contemporaries
they
are
of
their
time
they
inhale
its
intellectual
and
moral
atmosphere
they
follow
its
movement
they
share
in
its
shortcomings
and
in
its
aspirations
we
may
indeed
affirm
that
now
more
than
ever
men
are
of
their
time
thanks
to
the
rapidity
with
which
ideas
circulate
and
diffuse
themselves
although
men
read
less
in
france
than
in
many
other
countries
they
read
more
than
they
did
formerly
in
france
for
good
or
for
evil
there
are
influences
at
work
which
have
to
be
taken
into
account
one
of
our
first
duties
as
preachers
is
then
to
know
our
age
to
be
attentive
to
every
symptom
which
can
reveal
to
us
its
spirit
and
its
tendencies
to
neglect
this
duty
is
to
expose
ourselves
to
the
risk
of
addressing
so
to
say
fictitious
auditors
that
is
men
who
neither
have
the
ideas
nor
feel
the
sentiments
nor
think
of
the
objections
which
we
attribute
to
them
lxix
in
the
midst
of
the
discordant
voices
heard
it
is
easy
alas
to
distinguish
one
high
above
the
others
it
is
that
of
incredulity
not
as
in
the
last
century
marked
by
a
raillery
or
levity
but
by
an
earnestness
and
a
high
tone
occasionally
even
by
a
certain
melancholy
and
being
for
these
very
reasons
more
seductive
it
is
in
favour
of
the
progress
of
liberty
of
the
dignity
of
the
soul
that
is
to
say
of
everything
which
is
noblest
and
most
sacred
to
man
that
that
voice
addresses
our
generation
and
invites
it
to
bid
for
ever
adieu
to
the
faith
of
its
infancy
these
sad
words
which
pretend
to
toll
the
knell
of
christianity
express
but
too
faithfully
the
incredulity
dominant
in
the
elevated
regions
of
science
and
of
thought
whence
it
is
diffused
over
all
the
classes
of
society
it
is
impossible
to
deceive
ourselves
we
are
now
in
presence
of
a
fresh
and
a
great
conspiracy
not
only
against
the
faith
of
christ
but
against
every
religious
faith
the
leaders
of
incredulity
proclaim
aloud
that
the
cycle
of
religions
is
definitively
closed
and
that
we
have
once
for
all
to
efface
god
from
our
thoughts
and
from
our
lives
just
as
if
god
were
an
obsolete
hypothesis
with
which
modern
science
has
nothing
to
do
lxx
this
atheism
is
so
much
the
more
dangerous
and
contagious
in
these
days
that
it
does
not
appear
in
the
shape
of
a
mere
revolt
or
falling
off
of
the
mind
but
as
a
generous
doctrine
having
for
objects
the
enfranchisement
of
nations
and
their
delivery
from
the
yoke
of
priests
and
of
tyrants
who
it
is
supposed
are
combined
in
order
to
prey
upon
them
one
of
its
principal
adepts
guillaume
marr
exclaimed
a
few
years
ago
faith
in
a
personal
and
living
god
is
the
origin
the
fundamental
cause
of
the
miserable
state
of
society
in
which
we
exist
the
idea
of
a
god
is
the
of
the
arch
of
the
decayed
and
civilization
away
with
it
the
true
road
to
liberty
equality
and
happiness
is
atheism
there
is
no
hope
for
the
earth
so
long
as
man
shall
cling
to
heaven
by
even
a
thread
let
nothing
henceforth
stand
in
the
way
of
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
human
understanding
let
us
teach
man
that
he
has
no
other
god
than
himself
that
he
is
himself
the
alpha
and
omega
of
all
things
the
being
paramount
and
the
reality
most
real
lxxi
thus
contemporary
atheism
seeks
to
conquer
the
masses
by
their
weak
side
by
their
democratical
and
liberal
instincts
this
is
not
a
mere
system
it
is
a
powerful
party
which
has
its
lecturers
its
newspapers
its
associations
its
congresses
and
its
propaganda
a
man
of
earnest
meaning
pearson
estimated
at
copies
the
number
of
publications
avowedly
atheistical
which
appeared
in
england
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
it
is
not
only
in
england
that
atheism
is
raising
its
head
it
is
in
france
germany
and
italy
far
from
me
the
idea
of
setting
in
the
same
category
our
radical
reformers
and
the
disbelievers
and
free
thinkers
who
seek
to
destroy
every
faith
and
all
religion
let
us
hope
that
the
former
never
will
go
so
far
as
these
lxxii
but
definitively
they
openly
extend
to
them
a
sympathizing
hand
they
greet
their
writings
with
marked
favour
and
say
it
we
must
when
they
go
so
far
as
to
deny
the
supernatural
stripping
thus
christianity
of
every
divine
authority
or
when
merely
they
proclaim
the
unimportance
of
dogmas
to
a
religious
life
they
are
making
common
cause
with
atheism
and
working
without
suspecting
that
they
are
doing
so
at
the
same
work
of
destruction
but
although
we
have
all
this
to
deplore
how
many
subjects
have
we
for
hope
and
encouragement
moments
of
crisis
are
the
most
painful
but
they
are
not
the
least
fruitful
sow
we
do
indeed
with
tears
what
matters
after
all
that
no
hymn
of
triumph
attends
our
harvest
the
thing
essential
is
that
we
sow
behold
how
magnificently
the
ground
is
in
many
respects
prepared
for
the
christian
preacher
the
mere
fact
that
religious
questions
are
the
fashion
of
the
day
gives
us
an
immense
advantage
and
one
by
which
we
may
profit
is
it
not
very
encouraging
to
know
that
in
discussing
such
subjects
we
are
answering
to
serious
demands
of
general
interest
lxxiii
the
contest
which
divides
our
churches
has
been
certainly
hurtful
to
the
growth
of
piety
but
has
it
not
also
shaken
many
a
soul
from
its
torpor
has
it
not
impelled
many
persons
to
search
after
the
truth
who
were
before
indifferent
is
it
not
better
to
have
to
address
ourselves
to
souls
troubled
if
only
by
doubt
than
to
souls
plunged
in
the
heavy
torpor
of
indifference
after
all
our
age
has
its
grandeur
let
us
not
underrate
it
we
are
not
to
imitate
that
ready
and
vulgar
pessimism
which
sees
everything
dressed
in
the
livery
of
woe
and
which
delights
to
note
the
vices
and
shortcomings
of
an
epoch
without
admitting
the
virtue
to
which
it
can
lay
just
claim
or
its
generous
aspirations
it
is
certain
that
even
where
rejecting
the
dogmas
of
christianity
our
age
has
made
immense
progress
in
the
social
application
of
christianity
and
especially
in
philanthropy
the
age
passionately
loves
liberty
equality
tolerance
and
peace
it
insists
upon
respect
for
all
consciences
it
dreams
of
the
union
of
all
nations
it
occupies
itself
with
the
material
happiness
and
the
amelioration
of
all
classes
in
society
lxxiv
not
so
rich
as
other
ages
in
men
of
a
high
temper
of
character
men
really
original
our
age
has
nevertheless
contributed
more
than
others
perhaps
to
the
general
awakening
of
men
to
their
rights
as
individuals
and
of
and
consequently
to
the
sentiment
of
personal
responsibility
here
assuredly
we
have
noble
tendencies
precious
for
the
preachers
of
the
gospel
let
us
feel
no
dread
for
this
breath
of
liberalism
which
is
passing
over
nations
liberty
rightly
understood
leads
to
the
gospel
as
the
gospel
leads
to
liberty
and
now
what
have
we
to
say
to
this
age
so
tormented
what
ought
we
to
say
to
these
souls
who
have
confidence
in
us
and
who
demand
from
us
light
and
peace
how
often
has
this
question
overwhelmed
the
gospel
preacher
with
the
sentiment
of
his
weakness
and
insufficiency
how
often
has
it
made
him
prostrate
himself
in
his
agony
at
the
feet
of
the
lord
how
often
torn
from
him
the
cry
of
the
prophet
lord
god
behold
i
can
not
speak
for
i
am
a
child
lxxv
let
christian
science
proceed
with
its
work
she
has
assuredly
much
to
do
in
these
days
in
the
teeth
of
the
affirmations
of
positivism
and
of
materialism
let
her
make
her
own
affirmation
hers
the
task
to
show
that
the
biblical
dogmas
respecting
the
origin
of
the
world
and
of
man
are
infinitely
more
rational
and
more
scientific
than
all
that
in
these
days
men
seek
to
substitute
in
their
place
hers
the
task
to
prove
that
the
supernatural
far
from
being
antagonistic
to
the
science
of
nature
is
as
much
called
for
by
nature
as
by
the
sentiment
of
religion
itself
let
christian
philosophy
also
accomplish
her
task
hers
it
is
to
establish
the
profound
harmony
which
exists
between
reason
and
faith
hers
to
show
that
the
systems
by
which
men
seek
to
replace
christianity
present
to
the
thought
as
many
difficulties
if
not
more
than
any
which
follow
from
the
evangelical
dogmas

hers
the
task
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
philosophy
with
the
materials
furnished
by
revelation
and
by
the
christian
conscience

christian
literature
equally
accomplish
her
mission
let
her
spread
the
truth
by
the
means
infinitely
diverse
which
the
progress
of
the
press
has
placed
at
her
disposal
let
her
make
herself
popular
let
her
put
on
all
forms
to
combat
error
let
her
oppose
journal
to
journal

to
review

if
it
must
be
so
novel
to
novel
let
her
make
herself
everything
to
everybody
and
follow
the
adversary
upon
every
field
and
seize
all
his
arms
and
for
us
preachers
what
have
we
to
do
what
this
day
is
our
special
mission
in
the
special
position
in
which
god
has
placed
us

come
to
this

particular
object
of

study
and
of
his
report
made
by
him
to

conference
of
nérac
decoppel
enters
as
to
the
mission
and
actual
work
of
the
preachers
into
details
which
although
they
are
full
of
life
and
evince
the
greatest
practical
knowledge
apply
more
especially
to
the
protestant
churches
of
france
finally
he
reverts
to
the
general
question
of
christianity
by
a
concluding
remark
of
general
application
but
announcing
a
truth
of
both
practical
and
urgent
importance
for
all
the
christian
churches
what
is
most
essential
says
he
is
not
so
much
to
defend
christianity
as
to
present
it
to
our
age
not
as
an
enemy
that
comes
to
anathematize
and
to
combat
it
but
as
a
friend
that
comes
to
raise
it
and
save
it
beyond
a
doubt
we
must
not
fear
to
lay
stress
upon
christian
truth
and
to
present
it
with
its
most
salient
angles
and
its
austerest
face
in
advance
but
with
anathemas
and
declamations
we
must
have
done
what
most
is
necessary
is
that
we
address
a
word
of
sympathy
to
the
age
we
must
show
to
it
christianity
i
do
not
say
so
much
in
the
aspect
fitted
to
inspire
love
as
in
the
aspect
in
which
it
is
loving

paul
at
athens
he
does
not
consider
himself
bound
to
confound
the
idolatry
of
his
auditors
he
does
quite
the
contrary
he
knows
how
to
find
in
their
idolatry
itself
a
for
the
gospel
let
us
do
as
he
did
let
us
strive
we
also
to
find
these
those
keystones
upon
which
the
edifice
of
faith
may
in
these
days
be
made
safely
repose
it
is
more
especially
true
in
our
country
that
christianity
is
not
known
for
what
it
is
and
the
remark
applies
not
only
to
the
lower
classes
of
society
but
even
to
the
educated
classes
so
that
when
they
attack
christianity
it
is
as
it
were
an
attack
upon
a
thing
unknown
the
age
is
liberal
let
us
show
it
that
the
gospel
is
still
more
liberal
and
that
its
liberality
is
of
the
genuine
kind
the
age
loves
science
and
demands
a
rational
faith
let
us
show
it
that
faith
is
sovereign
reason
and
can
not
but
profit
by
every
conquest
achieved
by
science
lxxix
the
age
aspires
to
make
progress
in
every
branch
of
human
activity
let
us
show
it
that
all
genuine
progress
is
contained
in
the
principles
of
the
gospel
i
make
no
more
citations
i
neither
examine
nor
discuss
any
of
the
particular
ideas
or
phrases
or
words
which
these
two
documents
contain
i
would
solely
draw
attention
to
their
main
and
common
characteristic
these
writings
are
not
only
christian
but
uncompromisingly
christian
at
the
same
time
they
aim
at
leading
christianity
and
modern
society
to
understand
each
other
to
accept
each
other
mutually
and
freely
and
to
exercise
the
one
upon
the
other
such
an
action
as
shall
be
salutary
to
both
the
authors
are
not
authors
or
orators
or
amateurs
in
religion
or
in
philosophy
they
are
ecclesiastics
by
profession
belonging
to
different
churches
who
are
entering
upon
this
war
regarded
by
each
both
as
legitimate
and
necessary
who
are
labouring
to
draw
to
it
the
populations
placed
naturally
under
their
influence
and
are
hoping
without
doubt
that
their
efforts
will
be
successful
lxxx
i
think
that
they
are
right
both
in
their
hope
and
their
endeavours
and
knowing
that
outside
of
the
groups
of
persons
pledged
to
particular
opinions
or
sides
in
the
contests
of
religion
and
politics
there
exists
a
vast
population
uncertain
and
vacillating
now
indifferent
now
anxious
upon
the
subject
of
religious
questions
and
the
relations
of
christianity
to
modern
society
i
think
that
this
population
which
is
in
effect
france
is
capable
of
feeling
religious
emotions
of
being
informed
and
brought
back
to
the
great
beliefs
of
christianity
as
well
as
to
a
sentiment
of
the
natural
and
necessary
agreement
between
christian
faith
and
the
principles
of
public
liberty
the
profound
desire
which
i
feel
and
the
hope
from
which
i
will
not
part
of
this
great
result
have
induced
me
to
give
still
greater
development
to
these
meditations
and
to
risk
them
amidst
the
events
the
issue
of
which
is
obscure
which
are
now
crowding
upon
each
other
and
amidst
questions
passions
and
interests
to
which
such
subjects
are
all
very
strange
lxxxi
the
more
i
consider
the
matter
the
more
i
feel
persuaded
that
france
is
not
so
little
busied
as
she
would
appear
to
be
with
religious
questions
and
that
in
the
midst
of
her
languor
and
fluctuations
she
has
a
secret
sentiment
of
their
imperishable
grandeur
and
their
practical
importance
if
this
as
i
think
is
at
bottom
the
public
disposition
i
may
consider
myself
well

meditations
on
christianity
in
its
relation
to
the
actual
state
of
society
and
opinion
first
meditation
christianity
and
liberty
the
passionate
longing
both
of
men
and
of
nations
in
these
days
for
liberty
and
equality
is
a
fact
not
only
evident
but
dominant
in
modern
civilization
sometimes
this
desire
has
for
its
object
liberty
only
sometimes
equality
only
sometimes
both
simultaneously
sometimes
the
desire
is
at
once
intelligent
and
respectable
sometimes
nothing
more
than
a
blind
and
impulse
sometimes
the
feeling
displays
itself
in
revolutions
in
which
it
develops
itself
in
all
its
intensity
sometimes
it
fades
away
and
subsides
amidst
the
reactions
which
those
very
revolutions
have
by
their
calamities
and
excesses
called
forth
at
one
time
men
vaunt
that
the
problem
is
solved
at
another
they
are
discouraged
and
pronounce
it
to
be
insolvable
but
whether
they
vaunt
or
are
discouraged
the
passionate
desire
continues
to
exist
and
the
problem
ever
reappears
such
a
state
of
opinion
may
be
applauded
or
may
be
deplored
it
may
have
incense
showered
upon
it
or
it
may
be
visited
with
malediction
but
to
escape
from
it
is
an
impossibility
it
remains
a
trial
which
humanity
is
condemned
to
pass
through
it
furnishes
it
with
a
task
which
it
is
bound
to
perform
but
it
is
not
only
this
fact
and
this
problem
with
which
our
epoch
has
to
deal
at
their
side
there
is
another
not
less
important
the
solution
of
which
also
falls
within
the
mission
of
the
age
many
of
the
friends
of
liberty
and
equality
regard
christianity
and
especially
roman
catholicism
as
their
greatest
enemy
in
his
moments
of
perverseness
and
angry
waywardness
voltaire
so
treated
it
thousands
of
men
not
only
men
of
intelligence
but
a
multitude
of
others
obscure
enough
still
not
deficient
in
activity
speak
and
act
under
the
empire
of
the
same
idea
at
one
time
brutal
at
another
hypocritical
the
sentiment
is
at
once
ardent
and
is
it
well
founded
is
christianity
after
all
the
obstacle
to
the
progress
of
liberty
and
of
equality
or
is
it
not
on
the
contrary
rather
true
that
both
already
owe
much
to
christianity
and
that
both
require
its
sanction
and
its
support
to
ensure
their
legitimate
and
durable
triumph
the
great
question
of
the
century
remains
in
suspense
and
social
order
in
peril
so
long
as
that
other
question
is
not
solved
i

at
every
step
in
the
gospels
words
such
as
these
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
shall
gain

whole

man

in

his

the
dominant
idea
in
the
gospels
is
the
infinite
worth
of
the
human
soul
of
every
human
soul
jesus
came
to
influence
and
to
save
souls
all
souls
without
exception
souls
of
the
powerful
and
of
the
obscure
of
the
rich
and
poor
learned
and
ignorant
happy
or
afflicted
the
condition
and
the
salvation
of
souls
is
the
foundation
of
the
christian
religion
the
human
soul
is
no
mere
word
no
mere
abstraction
no
mere
hypothesis
the
soul
is
the
human
being
himself
the
individual
being
who
feels
and
thinks
enjoys
and
suffers
wills
and
acts
who
observes
and
knows
himself
in
the
complexity
of
his
actual
condition
and
to
whom
his
destiny
in
remote
futurity
is
an
object
of
present
solicitude
to
those
who
confound
soul
and
body
and
see
in
man
only
a
product
an
ephemeral
form
of
matter
i
have
nothing
to
say
what
have
they
to
do
with
the
words
of
the
gospel
with
the
immense
value
attached
to
a
fugitive
shadow
deceived
according
to
them
as
to
its
own
reality
and
only
appearing
to
lose
itself
forthwith
in
nonentity
it
is
spiritualists
and
christians
who
speak
with
propriety
when
they
discourse
in
grand
and
elevated
tones
of
the
human
soul
and
if
they
so
discourse
it
is
because
they
see
in
every
human
soul
a
true
being
a
real
and
individual
man
with
the
grandeur
of
man
nature
and
of
man
destiny
what
constitutes
the
essential
worth
of
the
human
being
of
every
human
being
is
that
he
is
free
to
act
or
not
to
act
and
that
he
is
morally
responsible
how
he
acts
man
believes
essentially
in
the
distinction
of
moral
good
and
evil
and
in
the
obligation
which
this
entails
he
believes
that
he
is
at
liberty
to
act
up
to
it
or
not
as
he
pleases
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
use
which
he
makes
of
his
liberty
it
is
because
such
is
the
nature
of
man
whether
his
own
conduct
is
in
conformity
to
it
or
not
that
the
gospel
exalts
man
so
nigh
and
accords
to
him
so
sublime
a
destiny
philosophers
christian
and
too
have
made
great
efforts
in
my
opinion
efforts
to
solve
the
problem
of
man
liberty
in
relation
to
god
prescience
the
gospel
recognises
and
proclaims
human
liberty
without
troubling
itself
about
the
problem
of
philosophy
the
christian
religion
entirely
rests
upon
the
fact
which
it
assumes
that
man
is
a
free
and
responsible
being
man
liberty
is
the
point
from
which
christianity
starts
in
all
that
she
says
to
humanity
and
in
every
command
that
she
gives
to
humanity
christianity
then
is
essentially
liberal
in
favour
of
all
men
and
of
them
as
men
by
her
elementary
and
fundamental
idea
of
man
nature
she
founds
his
liberty
upon
the
most
solid
basis
and
the
broadest
right
that
human
thought
can
conceive
the
most
daring
of
the
writers
on
public
law
never
carried
to
so
high
a
point
as
the
gospel
has
done
either
the
native
universal
dignity
of
man
nature
or
the
consequences
derivable
from
this
fact
christianity
does
not
confine
itself
to
this
after
having
laid
down
the
principle
of
liberty
it
gives
to
it
the
practical
sanction
which
liberty
requires
it
establishes
the
right
of
resistance
to
oppression
the
priests
and
the
chiefs
of
the
synagogue
at
jerusalem
commanded
them
peter
and
john
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
but
peter

john
answered
them
and
said

hearken

acts
xiv
it
is
the
peculiar
characteristic
and
honour
of
christianity
that
it
derives
both
the
right
of
resistance
to
oppression
and
the
principle
of
even
liberty
itself
not
from
the
temporal
and
transitory
interests
of
earthly
life
but
from
the
moral
and
eternal
interests
of
the
soul
at
the
same
time
that
it
affirms
the
principle
of
liberty
and
proclaims
its
consequences
it
equally
affirms
and
proclaims
the
principles
and
rights
of
authority
i
have
referred
to
this
upon
another
occasion
when
jesus
made
that
reply
to
the
question
of
the
pharisees
whether
it
was
permissible
or
not
to
pay
tribute
to
caesar
render
unto
cæsar
the
things
which
are
cæsar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
he
established
in
principle
the
distinction
between
the
religious
life
and
civil
life
between
the
church
and
the
state
cæsar
has
no
right
to
intervene
with
his
laws
and
material
force
between
the
soul
of
man
and
his
god
and
on
his
side
the
faithful
worshipper
of
god
is
bound
to
fulfil
towards
cæsar
the
duties
which
the
necessity
of
the
maintenance
of

meditations
upon
the
essence
of
christianity
london
it
was
by
affirming
and
defending
religious
liberty
the
highest
and
proudest
of
all
liberties
that
modern
civilization
commenced
the
principle
and
right
of
liberty
once
deeply
rooted
in
the
soul
the
flower
and
the
fruit
of
this
potent
germ
have
strongly
developed
themselves
in
the
course
of
ages
and
expanded
with
more
or
less
of
promptitude
and
fecundity
according
as
the
seasons
were
favourable
or
unfavourable
but
upon
the
whole
history
has
confirmed
the
gospel
of
all
the
religions
which
have
appeared
in
the
world
christianity
is
the
only
one
which
conquered
by
means
of
liberty
and
which
was
founded
upon
liberty
the
only
one
which
has
been
able
to
assume
and
keep
her
place
amidst
the
greatest
diversity
of
social
institutions
and
which
in
them
all
as
exigencies
required
accepted
and
supported
at
one
time
authority
at
another
liberty
even
if
i
wished
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
in
this
place
to
refer
to
more
than
the
general
and
evident
facts
of
history
if
i
remount
to
the
origins
of
the
different
religions
i
observe
that
christianity
was
the
only
one
which
did
not
appeal
to
force
she
was
the
only
one
which
did
not
employ
force
to
issue
forth
from
her
cradle
and
to
grow
during
more
than
three
centuries
she
alone
combated
and
conquered
her
adversaries
by
vanquishing
souls
in
the
name
of
truth
and
by
the
arms
of
truth
if
i
interrogate
the
results
i
find
that
three
great
religious
establishments
paganism
bouddhism
and
mahometanism
have
held
and
with
christianity
still
hold
a
great
place
in
the
world
paganism
after
some
fair
but
brief
moments
of
progress
attained
to
nothing
but
the
anarchy
of
the
greek
and
roman
republics
and
the
despotic
decay
of
the
roman
empire
bouddhism
did
nothing
but
generate
the
fantastic
superstitions
and
the
enervating
abstractions
of
a
pantheistic
mythology
amidst
the
immobility
of
the
castes
and
the
stagnation
of
absolute
power
mahometanism
carried
into
every
quarter
to
which
she
penetrated
only
the
yoke
of
force
the
incurable
animosity
of
races
the
sterility
of
conquest
christianity
alone
accepted
the
spirit
of
liberty
and
progress
where
she
found
it
already
existing
in
the
soul
of
man
and
in
human
societies
and
where
she
did
not
find
it
she
awakened
it
let
me
not
be
accused
of
forgetting
that
since
the
triumph
of
christianity
oppressive
tyrannies
and
odious
persecutions
have
occurred
in
different
christian
societies
in
the
name
of
the
christian
faith
no
one
more
than
i
deplores
and
detests
such
facts
they
were
the
work
of
the
sins
of
men
not
of
the
principles
of
christianity
which
far
from
authorising
them
condemns
them
water
from
the
purest
source
is
changed
and
polluted
in
its
course
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
after
it
has
been
exposed
to
the
stormy
atmospheric
influences
in
creating
man
free
god
left
him
a
part
and
a
share
in
his
own
destiny
and
in
the
events
which
determine
it
christianity
emanating
from
god
marks
out
and
combats
uncompromisingly
all
evil
desires
and
bad
motives
all
the
excesses
and
all
the
weaknesses
of
man
selfishness
she
has
not
destroyed
them
she
did
not
at
once
restore
innocence
to
man
nor
make
him
a
present
of
virtue
he
is
bound
to
labour
in
the
work
of
his
own
control
and
of
his
own
reformation
the
gospel
is
a
mirror
in
which
if
he
looks
at
himself
he
may
it
is
true
behold
the
stains
upon
his
soul
and
upon
his
life
but
those
stains
proceed
from
himself
and
not
from
the
mirror
which
only
enables
him
to
see
them
when
we
lay
to
the
charge
of
the
christian
religion
the
fatal
errors
the
unlawful
passions
and
actions
which
have
appeared
under
its
name
in
the
history
of
christian
societies
we
acquit
without
reason
men
whether
princes
or
nations
learned
or
ignorant
of
the
responsibility
that
weighs
upon
them
we
ignore
what
christianity
commands
and
what
she
forbids
we
demand
from
her
that
which
she
has
not
promised
of
history
thus
far
i
now
confine
myself
to
the
present
epoch
and
to
the
problems
which
the
actual
relations
of
christianity
to
liberty
present
what
are
the
principal
obstacles
at
the
present
day
in
the
way
of
the
establishment
of
a
real
and
lasting
liberty
and
what
are
the
means
within
our
reach
to
surmount
them
in
other
terms
which
express
my
meaning
more
exactly
what
are
our
infirmities
to
retard
what
our
strength
to
accelerate
the
establishment
of
a
free
government
is
christianity
an
obstacle
to
us
in
this
work
or
a
help
an
ill
or
a
remedy
it
is
with
a
profound
feeling
of
sadness
that
i
see
eminent
men
men
truly
christian
incessantly
depicting
in
the
most
sombre
colours
society
as
it
now
exists
and
representing
it
as
only
a
prey
to
political
and
moral
diseases
now
acute
now
indolent
as
deprived
thereby
of
all
title
to
respect
and
of
all
hope
of
amelioration
incapacitated
at
one
time
for
orderly
life
at
another
for
liberty
as
for
straightforward
attacks
upon
our
vices
and
failings
our
errors
and
shortcomings
i
complain
not
of
them
however
violent
nations
as
well
as
individuals
require
to
be
often
admonished
frankly
and
with
severity
the
rudeness
which
shakes
them
is
more
salutary
than
the
indulgence
which
cradles
them
to
sleep
but
what
i
regret
and
deplore
in
the
attitude
and
in
the
language
of
these
worthy
christian
censors
is
not
that
they
scrupulously
and
unsparingly
expose
prevalent
evils
our
bad
propensities
and
our
foolish
pretensions
but
that
they
ignore
what
good
there
is
in
us
the
progress
which
we
make
and
the
just
and
salutary
results
to
which
we
are
tending
the
simultaneous
presence
the
profound
intermixture
of
good
and
evil
of
virtue
and
vice
of
wisdom
and
folly
is
the
chronic
sore
of
man
and
of
human
societies
this
is
no
new
fact
no
evil
which
we
are
the
first
to
endure
and
for
which
we
are
the
first
to
be
responsible
it
is
the
old
condition
of
the
world
as
it
appears
from
the
constant
testimony
of
history
each
of
its
ages
has
incurred
and
has
merited
reproaches
not
the
same
but
at
least
as
serious
as
those
laid
to
the
charge
of
our
age
and
if
we
were
suddenly
transported
to
any
other
epoch
of
the
past
it
matters
not
to
which
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
we
would
not
willingly
accept
that
epoch
in
exchange
for
our
own
nor
should
we
even
very
much
like
to
contemplate
the
spectacle
severity
is
well
but
justice
is
due
to
different
periods
and
different
conditions
of
society
in
the
last
hundred
years
we
have
gained
more
both
in
morality
and
in
common
sense
than
we
have
ever
forgotten
and
here
i
am
met
by
a
question
respecting
which
i
will
explain
my
view
unreservedly
and
at
once
society
in
france
has
reached
its
actual
condition
only
by
a
progressive
effort
an
advance
more
or
less
perceptible
more
or
less
rapid
but
not
without
numerous
interruptions
and
vicissitudes
it
has
sought
to
escape
in
turn
from
the
feudal
system
from
the
pretensions
and
the
selfish
contests
of
the
great
nobles
from
the
predominance
of
the
court
from
arbitrariness
from
the
improvidence
and
caprices
of
absolute
power
national
unity
civil
equality
and
political
liberty
have
been
throughout
the
whole
course
of
our
history
the
objects
of
our
aim
and
desire
our
greatest
thinkers
the
actors
on
the
stage
of
our
politics
the
nation
itself
with
its
tendency
dimly
marked
yet
powerful
have
constantly
proceeded
in
this
direction
and
towards
this
object
the
revolution
of
was
the
most
violent
and
most
serious
explosion
of
this
incessant
travail
of
france
was
it
pregnant
with
fruitful
consequences
or
is
the
issue
to
be
now
deplored
france
believed
that
she
had
then
gained
a
great
victory
not
only
for
herself
but
for
all
mankind
did
she
deceive
herself
have
we
been
for
so
many
centuries
proceeding
in
a
good
road
or
in
a
bad
road
towards
success
or
towards
delusion
are
we
progressing
or
are
we
declining
it
is
a
question
upon
which
eminent
men
and
men
whose
opinions
are
entitled
to
every
respect
are
at
the
present
day
not
all
of
the
same
opinion
for
whereas
some
persist
in
a
cry
of
triumph
others
give
but
utterance
to
gloomy
and
alarming
prognostics
i
have
some
right
to
say
that
no
one
is
more
struck
more
shocked
than
i
am
by
the
crimes
faults
errors
and
follies
both
of
opinion
and
action
generated
by
this
french
revolution
i
never
hesitated
openly
to
characterise
them
as
in
my
opinion
they
deserved
indeed
the
severe
contests
through
which
i
have
had
to
pass
in
my
public
career
may
perhaps
in
some
degree
have
originated
in
my
sincerity
upon
this
subject
i
had
to
confront
many
prejudices
and
to
wound
much
i
regret
no
sentiment
which
i
felt
and
i
retract
no
language
which
i
used
but
in
spite
of
the
strong
opinions
which
have
been
attributed
to
me
i
was
and
still
am
convinced
that
upon
the
whole
whatever
the
evil
which
that
revolution
occasioned
and
is
occasioning
it
nevertheless
served
the
good
cause
both
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
i
believe
that
france
and
the
world
will
gain
by
it
more
than
they
suffered
or
are
suffering
and
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
all
our
trials
still
in
an
æra
of
progress
and
not
at
the
commencement
of
a
decline
i
derive
motives
for
my
optimism
upon
this
subject
in
the
sphere
of
ideas
as
well
as
in
that
of
facts
theoretically
the
principles
of
contain
a
large
share
of
truth
truth
pregnant
of
consequence
truth
superior
to
the
share
of
error
which
they
contain
and
which
is
nevertheless
large
historically
the
tendency
and
the
travail
of
opinion
which
have
been
for
centuries
a
source
to
france
of
incontestable
progress
in
the
way
of
justice
liberty
and
social
happiness
can
not
have
become
all
of
a
sudden
a
cause
of
decline
practically
in
spite
of
all
its
ills
and
all
its
shortcomings
the
present
century
has
no
cause
to
dread
a
comparison
with
past
centuries
there
never
has
been
any
epoch
in
the
history
of
french
society
in
which
it
would
have
bettered
its
condition
by
halting
or
to
which
it
should
wish
to
return
i
revert
to
my
question
what
perils
what
obstacles
do
our
social
institutions
and
our
manners
oppose
to
the
establishment
of
liberty
with
effect
and
upon
a
lasting
footing
is
christianity
of
a
nature
to
stand
us
in
good
stead
or
to
hurt
us
in
such
a
work
all
earnest
men
all
men
at
the
present
day
whether
they
are
conservatives
or
liberals
christians
or
catholics
or
protestants
are
unanimous
in
deploring
the
preponderance
of
material
interests
the
thirst
for
physical
and
vulgar
pleasures
and
the
habits
of
selfishness
and
effeminacy
which
they
generate
they
are
right
we
have
indeed
here
an
evil
greater
when
we
consider
what
is
the
mission
of
our
epoch
than
perhaps
even
those
believe
it
to
be
who
deplore
it
the
emperor
napoleon
said
in
a
phrase
marked
by
all
the
clear
and
forcible
colouring
of
his
habitual
language
i
do
not
fear
conspirators
who
rise
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
who
can
not
do
without
a
fresh

there
is
no
question
of
conspirators
here
and
for
the
soul
to
be
vigorous
it
is
not
essential
that
the
care
of
the
person
should
be
neglected
what
concerns
those
who
would
be
free
whether
individuals

is
that
they
should
not
have
their
attention
essentially
absorbed
by
considerations
affecting
merely
their
material
prosperity
or
their
petty
personal
comforts
they
have
especially
to
guard
themselves
against
selfishness
and
epicureanism
whether
his
tastes
be
refined
or
gross
the
epicurean
does
not
readily
resign
himself
to
make
either
effort
or
sacrifice
but
he
is
not
difficult
to
content
if
he
is
permitted
to
enjoy
his
pleasures
and
his
repose
selfishness
even
where
it
is
sober
and

is
a
cold
and
sterile
passion
it
owes
its
empire
to
its
success
in
enervating
and
lowering
a
man
nature
liberty
calls
for
a
character
of
more
strength
higher
aspirations
greater
power
of
resistance
a
state
of
soul
offering
freer
action
to
moral
sympathy
and
disinterested
motives
it
is
precisely
here
that
christianity
can
supply
modern
society
with
that
of
which
it
stands
in
need
christianity
teaches
all
men
the
great
and
the
small
the
rich
and
the
poor
not
to
devote
all
their
lives
to
material
things
she
summons
them
to
more
elevated
regions
and
whilst
she
inspires
them
with
a
purer
ambition
she
opens
to
them
a
fairer
hope
even
of
happiness
the
christian
whether
his
station
be
powerful
or
humble
and
his
aspirations
ambitious
or
modest
can
never
find
an
exclusive
object
of
attention
or
an
exclusive
motive
to
action
even
in
that
principle
of
interest
which
politicians
using
the
word
in
its
best
sense
vainly
imagine
to
be
a
panacea
man
whether
towards
his
or
on
his
own
account
has
another
object
to
pursue
other
laws
to
accomplish
other
sentiments
to
display
and
to
satisfy
he
can
neither
be
an
epicurean
nor
an
egotist
this
is
the
first
and
the
greatest
of
the
services
which
christianity
can
and
does
render
in
our
days
to
every
society
which
aspires
to
liberty
i
proceed
to
mention
a
second
service
there
is
no
liberty
without
a
large
measure
of
license
they
are
dreamers
who
hope
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
one
without
incurring
the
risk
and
undergoing
the
inconveniences
of
the
other
they
too
are
dreamers
who
believe
that
license
will
ever
be
effectually
repressed
by
penalties
courts
of
justice
or
measures
of
police
two
things
are
certain
the
one
is
that
it
is
idle
to
attempt
to
repress
license
completely
in
a
free
country
the
other
that
the
moral
and
preventive
forces
of
society
itself
are
alone
to
be
relied
upon
both
by
governments
and
nations
to
enable
them
to
support
that
license
which
they
can
not
suppress
christianity
is
the
most
efficacious
the
most
popular
and
the
most
approved
of
these
forces
it
is
efficacious
against
license
for
two
reasons
and
in
two
ways
in
principle
christianity
maintains
to
authority
its
right
and
its
rank
intact
without
humbling
it
before
liberty
christianity
yet
recognises
the
rights
of
liberty
and
demands
that
these
should
be
admitted
in
fact
christianity
inspires
men
with
a
sentiment
with
which
authority
can
not
dispense
respect
the
absence
of
respect
is
the
most
serious
danger
to
which
authority
is
exposed
authority
suffers
much
more
from
insult
than
from
attack
it
is
precisely
to
the
task
of
systematically
insulting
and
debasing
authority
that
its
most
ardent
opponents
in
our
days
address
themselves
with
most
passion
and
with
most
art
there
exist
licentious
turbulent
and
insolent
persons
in
christian
societies
just
as
such
exist
in
other
societies
but
christian
principles
and
christian
habits
make
and
maintain
friends
to
order
in
the
great
mass
of
the
people
as
well
as
in
the
higher
classes
friends
to
order
who
respect
order
both
in
law
and
in
morals
men
whom
licentious
and
insulting
conduct
shock
as
much
as
they
terrify
and
who
equally
free
appeal
in
their
own
favour
to
the
maxims
and
the
arms
of
liberty
history
supplies
us
on
this
subject
with
conclusive
examples
the
nations
of
christendom
are
the
only
nations
to
which
license
has
not
brought
as
a
final
consequence
anarchy
and
despotism
the
only
nations
which
although
they
have
on
different
occasions
and
by
salutary
reactions
experienced
the
excesses
both
of
power
and
of
liberty
have
not
succumbed
under
them
morally
and
politically
neither
the
states
of
pagan
antiquity
nor
those
of
the
east
whether
bouddhist
or
mussulman
have
stood
such
trials
these
have
had
their
days
of
healthy
vigour
and
even
of
glory
but
when
the
evils
which
license
or
tyranny
generated
have
once
come
upon
them
they
have
fallen
irretrievably
and
all
their
subsequent
history
has
merely
been
that
of
a
decline
more
or
less
rapid
more
or
less
stormy
more
or
less
apathetic
it
is
the
honour
of
the
christian
religion
that
it
has
within
it
that
which
can
cure
states
of
their
maladies
as
well
as
individuals
of
their
errors
and
that
by
the
belief
which
it
generates
and
the
sentiments
which
it
inspires
it
has
already
more
than
once
furnished
sometimes
to
the
friends
of
order
and
sometimes
to
the
friends
of
liberty
a
refuge
in
their
reverses
as
well
as
strength
to
recover
lost
ground
it
would
be
as
imprudent
as
ungrateful
in
these
days
for
the
friends
of
liberty
to
ignore
this
grand
fact
and
its
salutary
admonishment
they
are
called
to
a
work
much
more
difficult
than
any
that
they
have
hitherto
had
to
accomplish
their
task
is
no
longer
merely
to
search
after
guarantees
for
liberty
against
the
encroachments
of
power
or
the
accidental
and
transient
ebullition
of
license
they
have
to
reconcile
the
normal
and
constitutional
dominion
of
democracy
with
liberty
and
with
the
regular
action
and
permanence
of
liberty
until
modern
times
political
liberty
wherever
it
has
existed
has
been
the
result
of
the
simultaneous
presence
and
of
the
conflict
of
different
forces
of
society
no
one
of
them
strong
enough
to
rule
alone
but
each
too
weak
to
resist
efficaciously
the
attack
of
the
others
at
one
time
the
crown
at
another
the
aristocracy
at
another
the
church
each
previously
powerful
and
independent
have
lived
side
by
side
with
democracy
when
democracy
has
had
limits
and
restrictions
imposed
upon
its
power
and
success
but
at
the
present
day
there
are
amongst
us
no
distinct
surviving
influences
which
are
powerful
enough
to
play
a
similar
part
in
society
and
in
the
government
the
crown
the
aristocracy
and
the
church
are
no
longer
anything
but
frail
wrecks
of
the
past
or
instruments
created
by
the
democracy
and
indebted
to
it
for
a
borrowed
force
is
this
to
be
henceforth
the
permanent
condition
of
human
society
or
is
it
only
a
phase
more
or
less
transitory
of
a
series
of
ages
and
of
revolutions
which
fresh
ages
and
fresh
revolutions
will
hereafter
profoundly
modify
futurity
must
decide
in
any
case
it
is
only
under
the
exclusive
dominion
of
a
single
force
democracy
that
in
these
days
free
institutions
can
be
founded
that
every
dominant
force
when
single
is
tempted
to
commit
abuses
and
to
become
tyrannical
is
a
truth
so
much
in
accordance
with
the
lessons
of
experience
and
with
the
conclusions
of
reason
that
no
pains
need
be
taken
to
insist
upon
it
not
to
speak
of
the
dangerous
acclivity
upon
which
democracy
in
common
with
all
other
forces
is
placed
it
has
peculiar
characteristics
which
are
not
of
a
nature
to
set
the
friends
of
liberty
at
their
ease
democracy
derives
its
origin
and
power
from
the
right
of
every
human
will
and
from
the
majority
of
human
wills
truth
and
error
press
so
very
closely
upon
each
other
in
this
system
that
liberty
is
placed
in
a
position
of
great
peril
man
volition
is
entitled
to
every
respect
but
it
is
not
all
its
law
to
itself
nor
is
it
in
itself
essentially
a
law
at
all
it
is
bound
to
another
law
which
does
not
emanate
from
itself
and
which
comes
to
it
from
a
higher
source
than
man
and
which
it
is
as
unable
to
abrogate
as
it
was
to
create
the
law
paramount
is
the
moral
law
the
law
laid
down
by
god
to
which
all
wills
of
men
whatever
their
number
are
bound
to
submit
democracy
essentially
busied
with
the
wills
of
men
is
always
inclined
to
attribute
to
them
the
character
and
the
rights
of
divine
law
man
occupies
so
much
space
in
this
form
of
government
and
has
so
elevated
a
position
there
that
he
easily
forgets
god
easily
takes
himself
for
god
the
result
is
a
sort
of
political
polytheism
which
unless
it
appeals
to
a
gross
material
arbitrament
and
to
the
majority
of
human
wills
is
incapable
of
arriving
at
that
unity
of
law
and
of
action
with
which
no
society
or
government
can
dispense
i
do
not
say
that
the
individual
man
and
that
numbers
of
men
are
the
only
principles
but
i
do
say
that
they
are
principles
characteristic
of
democracy
it
is
against
the
absolute
dominion
of
these
two
principles
that
democracy
has
in
the
interest
of
its
own
honour
and
of
its
own
safety
to
be
incessantly
admonished
and
defended
a
royal
sage
enjoined
that
he
should
be
saluted
every
morning
with
the
words
remember
thou
art
man
this
sublime
and
prudent
admonition
is
no
less
needful
for
democracy
than
for
royalty
and
it
is
precisely
the
salutary
service
which
is
rendered
to
it
by
christianity
in
christianity
there
is
a
light
a
voice
a
law
a
history
which
does
not
come
from
man
but
which
without
offending
his
dignity
sets
him
in
his
proper
place
no
belief
no
institution
exalts
man
dignity
so
highly
and
at
the
same
time
so
effectually
represses
his
arrogance
the
more
democratic
a
society
is
the
more
it
is
important
that
this
double
effect
shall
take
place
within
it
christianity
alone
has
this
virtue
i
am
aware
of
the
capital
objection
made
to
its
empire
the
physic
without
the
physicians
exclaimed
rousseau
in
a
sally
against
medical
men
but
the
expression
shows
nevertheless
how
little
he
was
disposed
to
forget
that
it
is
possible
for
medicine
to
be
good
and
salutary
how
often
have
i
heard
men
of
intelligence
and
men
in
all
other
respects
very
worthy
of
consideration
exclaim
let
me
have
religion
without
the
priests
i
am
a
christian
but
no
friend
of
the
clergy
i
am
far
from
seeking
to
leave
this
difficulty
unnoticed
or
to
elude
it
it
is
a
difficulty
of
the
gravest
nature
not
in
essence
but
in
the
actual
circumstances
and
state
of
opinions
at
the
present
day
as
a
protestant
it
does
not
concern
me
the
clergy
is
not
amongst
protestants
the
object
of
any
such
uneasiness
one
of
the
best
results
in
my
opinion
of
the
reformation
of
the
century
whether
regarded
as
lutheran
or
calvinistic
as
anglican
or
as
the
work
of
other
dissidents
in
religion
is
that
it
strongly
cemented
the
union
between
the
ecclesiastics
and
the
general
religious
community
between
the
spiritual
and
the
lay
members
of
the
church
the
reformation
produced
this
effect
first
by
authorising
the
clergy
to
marry
and
to
enter
into
the
relations
which
a
life
of
family
brings
with
it
and
secondly
by
giving
to
the
laity
a
share
in
the
government
of
the
church
the
partition
was
not
always
judicious
or
equitable
at
one
time
the
clergy
at
another
the
laity
have
been
transported
from
their
natural
places
and
injured
in
their
legitimate
rights
but
the
relations
between
the
two
classes
ceased
to
present
the
appearance
of
either
absolutism
on
the
one
hand
or
of
entire
subordination
on
the
other
the
laity
obtained
a
voice
and
influence
in
the
affairs
of
the
flock
the
priests
although
remaining
religious
pastors
and
religious
magistrates
ceased
to
be
spiritual
masters
this
organisation
has
led
to
the
two
social
institutions
combining
themselves
in
a
variety
of
ways
at
one
time
the
civil
power
has
invaded
the
government
of
the
religious
society
and
deprived
the
clergy
not
merely
of
empire
but
of
independence
at
another
time
the
two
forms
of
society
the
state
and
the
church
have
regulated
by
treaty
the
terms
of
their
mutual
relations
whereas
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
two
forms
of
society
have
been
entirely
separated
and
have
mutually
recovered
their
independence
elsewhere
as
amongst
the
quakers
and
the
moravians
all
ecclesiastical
authority
and
orders
of
priesthood
have
been
abolished
and
laymen
have
lived
in
the
isolation
each
of
his
individual
conscience
obedient
only
to
its
spontaneous
impulses
but
amidst
all
this
diversity
it
is
the
fundamental
characteristic
of
the
churches
and
of
the
sects
which
issued
from
the
reform
of
the
century
that
priests
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
the
necessary
and
sovereign
mediators
between
god
and
man
soul
nor
the
sole
rulers
of
religious
society
it
is
particularly
by
virtue
of
this
principle
that
the
distinction
between
civil
life
and
religious
life
has
become
an
efficacious
and
a
consecrated
doctrine
and
that
liberty
has
resumed
its
right
and
become
an
active
influence
in
religious
society
itself
but
amongst
roman
catholic
nations
priests
are
the
objects
of
a
persistent
distrust
which
has
been
the
fruitful
source
of
much
calamity
to
christianity
history
forbids
surprise
the
roman
catholic
clergy
has
often
presented
the
spectacle
of
ambition
and
passion
of
mundane
and
selfish
interests
strangely
intermixed
with
faith
and
with
earnest
zeal
for
the
furtherance
of
their
religious
mission
serious
ills
and
grave
abuses
have
resulted
therefrom
in
the
relation
of
church
to
state
and
of
priests
to
their
flocks
and
even
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
itself
these
are
facts
almost
as
undisputed
as
they
are
indisputable
in
proof
of
them
the
testimony
not
only
of
its
adversaries
but
of
the
holiest
members
of
the
church
of
rome
itself
may
be
invoked
nothing
is
more
natural
and
indeed
more
inevitable
than
that
this
should
have
led
and
should
still
lead
not
only
to
towards
priests
but
to
their
being
regarded
as
proper
subjects
for
attack
it
is
not
however
on
that
account
less
certain
that
such
an
attack
is
in
our
days
and
as
society
is
at
present
constituted
unjust
silly
and
inopportune
as
injurious
to
state
as
to
church
to
liberty
as
to
religion
there
may
be
injustice
and
ingratitude
to
institutions
as
well
as
to
individuals
from
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
during
the
rudest
and
most
sombre
ages
of
modern
history
the
catholic
clergy
whether
as
popes
bishops
monastic
orders
or
simple
priests
in
the
midst
of
their
selfish
pretensions
and
ambitious
usurpations
displayed
and
expended
treasures
of
intellect
courage
and
perseverance
in
order
to
affirm
and
protect
the
immaterial
and
moral
interests
of
humanity
they
did
not
on
all
occasions
accept
their
mission
to
its
full
extent
they
did
not
maintain
the
christian
religion
in
all
its
breadth
and
in
all
its
evangelical
disinterestedness
they
had
their
share
in
the
acts
of
violence
iniquity
and
tyranny
of
the
different
masters
of
society
for
the
time
being
they
often
made
liberty
pay
dearly
for
the
services
which
they
rendered
to
civilization
but
when
liberty
has
become
one
of
the
conquests
of
that
very
civilization
the
proof
as
well
as
the
guarantee
for
its
further
progress
there
is
injustice
and
ingratitude
in
forgetting
what
part
the
roman
catholic
clergy
effected
towards
the
constitution
of
that
society
the
ultimate
result
of
which
has
been
so
glorious
the
injustice
is
the
greater
that
it
is
now
inopportune
and
useless
from
the
acrimony
the
anger
and
alarm
which
characterise
the
attacks
directed
at
roman
catholicism
and
its
priests
we
might
suppose
that
the
inquisition
was
at
our
gates
that
rome
was
making
a
perilous
onslaught
upon
our
civil
and
religious
liberties
and
that
we
need
to
deploy
all
our
force
and
all
our
passions
to
repulse
the
domination
of
the
court
of
rome
and
of
its
army
was
there
ever
so
strange
a
perversion
of
facts
for
a
century
past
on
which
side
has
been
the
movement
and
the
aggression
is
it
not
evidently
the
spirit
of
religious
and
political
liberty
which
has
now
the
initiative
the
impulsive
onward
movement
the
defensive
is
the
natural
and
enforced
situation
of
the
roman
catholic
church
romanism
is
much
more
menaced
much
more
attacked
by
public
opinion
in
these
days
than
our
liberties
are
menaced
or
attacked
by
her
the
supreme
power
in
the
church
of
rome
the
papacy
does
indeed
maintain
in
principle
certain
maxims
and
certain
traditions
irreconcileable
with
the
actual
state
of
opinion
and
society
it
continues
to
condemn
authoritatively
some
of
the
essential
principles
of
modern
civilization
in
all
earnestness
yet
with
every
feeling
of
respect
i
shall
here
make
at
once
use
of
my
right
both
as
a
protestant
and
as
the
citizen
of
a
free
country
to
declare
my
profound
conviction
that
this
systematic
persistence
however
conscientious
and
dignified
it
may
be
shows
a
great
want
of
religious
foresight
as
well
as
of
political
prudence
i
think
that
romanism
without
abdication
and
without
renouncing
anything
that
is
vitally
essential
to
itself
might
assume
a
position
in
harmony
with
the
moral
and
social
state
in
these
days
and
with
the
conditions
also
vitally
essential
to
the
existence
of
such
state
i
may
add
that
so
long
as
the
government
of
the
romish
church
shall
not
have
accepted
and
accomplished
this
work
of
conciliation
conciliation
real
and
profound
the
friends
of
liberty
will
be
justified
in
keeping
themselves
on
the
alert
and
in
maintaining
a
reserve
towards
it
as
representing
themselves
those
moral
and
liberal
principles
which
it
disavows
but
let
them
not
attribute
to
this
disavowal
a
greater
importance
than
it
deserves
let
them
watch
the
ecclesiastical
power
which
utters
it
without
alarm
it
has
in
it
nothing
very
menacing
nothing
that
opposes
any
effectual
barrier
to
the
march
of
events
liberalism
is
not
the
less
victorious
in
these
days
and
not
the
less
advancing
many
faults
have
been
committed
and
many
probably
will
continue
to
be
committed
as
has
already
been
the
case
we
shall
have
perhaps
many
a
barrier
opposed
in
our
path
many
a
reactionary
movement
to
endure
but
the
general
onward
impulse
will
nevertheless
be
the
same
and
the
final
result
the
conquest
of
liberty
religious
civil
and
political
not
the
less
a
certainty
this
is
no
mere
philosophical
aspiration
it
is
already
history
there
have
been
many
vicissitudes
in
france
and
many
a
crisis
of
different
kinds
during
the
last
hundred
years
in
the
struggle
between
liberalism
and
roman
catholicism
the
former
has
often
committed
errors
made
mistakes
by
which
romanism
has
adroitly
profited
but
at
every
reverse
romanism
has
recognised
her
own
defeat
and
accepted
some
part
of
its
consequences
the
constituent
assembly
by
the
civil
organisation
of
the
clergy
the
national
convention
by
its
proscriptions
had
endeavoured
the
one
to
enslave
the
other
to
abolish
the
catholic
church
the
great
master
of
the
revolution
napoleon
raised
it
up
again
by
the
concordat
of
but
the
concordat
at
the
same
time
consecrated
many
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
liberal
regime
and
the
catholic
church
of
rome
consecrated
napoleon
and
signed
the
concordat
even
whilst
protesting
against
some
of
its
consequences
at
the
restoration
some
wished
to
discuss
again
the
question
of
the
concordat
and
to
the
relation
between
church
and
state
upon
their
ancient
foundations
but
the
attempt
encountered
in
the
ranks
of
the
royalists
themselves
a
decisive
resistance
and
totally
failed
under
the
government
of
roman
catholicism
regained
its
ground
and
resumed
fresh
vigour
by
both
using
the
name
of
liberty
and
claiming
its
right
when
the
republic
again
appeared
in
roman
catholicism
treated
it
with
as
much
tenderness
as
it
experienced
itself
from
the
republic
i
pause
before
the
actual
relations
of
the
church
of
rome
to
the
new
empire
rome
has
paid
a
dear
price
for
all
that
she
has
received
from
the
empire
but
even
here
she
showed
and
appears
disposed
still
to
show
a
large
measure
of
patience
and
resignation
she
is
right
one
fact
particularly
arrests
my
attention
in
the
course
of
this
stormy
history
in
the
midst
of
her
reverses
and
her
concessions
roman
catholicism
has
displayed
rare
and
energetic
virtues
of
fidelity
and
independence
she
has
opposed
to
the
bloody
persecution
of
terrorism
the
inexhaustible
blood
of
her
martyrs
bishops
priests
monks
men
and
women
that
clergy
of
france
once
so
vacillating
in
faith
and
so
mundane
in
morals
bore
their
cross
with
an
indomitable
sentiment
of
christian
honour
the
despotism
of
the
emperor
napoleon
encountered
in
the
person
of
pope
pius
in
some
cardinals
and
some
bishops
a
passive
but
firm
resistance
which
neither
the
power
of
the
despot
nor
the
contagious
servility
of
their
contemporaries
could
surmount
and
again
in
these
days
who
can
fail
to
perceive
with
what
activity
and
devotedness
with
what
sacrifices
and
efficacy
roman
catholicism
by
the
mere
force
of
its
native
energy
upholds
the
cause
of
its
chief
and
of
itself
if
civil
society
had
defended
its
liberties
and
its
dignities
as
the
church
of
rome
defends
hers
liberalism
in
france
would
be
farther
advanced
on
its
road
and
towards
its
object
but
let
not
romanists
deceive
themselves
one
can
not
make
use
of
liberty
without
being
forced
to
enter
into
an
engagement
and
compromise
with
liberty
one
can
not
appeal
to
liberty
without
doing
homage
to
her
she
lays
her
hand
upon
those
to
whom
she
lends
her
aid
the
great
fact
which
i
before
invoked
the
work
of
reconciliation
between
modern
society
and
roman
catholicism
is
more
advanced
than
those
believe
who
still
stand
aloof
from
it
and
oppose
it
this
is
proved
by
two
facts
in
the
very
bosom
of
roman
catholicism
and
from
amongst
its
most
zealous
defenders
that
group
of
liberal
catholics
was
formed
which
has
played
and
which
continues
to
play
so
active
a
part
in
struggling
for
the
liberties
of
their
church
and
for
the
rights
of
their
chief
these
are
at
once
the
ornaments
of
then
church
and
its
intellectual
sword
and
the
publication
which
supports
their
views
the
correspondant
is
next
to
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
the
periodical
which
meets
with
most
success
and
has
the
greatest
circulation
passing
from
this
brilliant
group
to
the
more
modest
ranks
of
the
roman
catholic
clergy
i
ask
what
is
the
disposition
the
attitude
the
conduct
of
those
faithful
and
humble
priests
who
exercise
the
christian
ministry
in
our
provinces
and
in
the
inferior
quarters
of
our
cities
they
have
not
always
all
the
science
all
the
mental
culture
which
one
might
desire
but
whilst
adhering
to
catholic
faith
and
giving
the
example
of
christian
lives
they
live
in
the
midst
of
the
people
they
know
it
they
understand
it
they
are
aware
what
the
conditions
are
which
permit
them
to
live
with
and
to
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
people
they
enter
by
degrees
into
its
sentiments
and
its
instincts
without
premeditation
almost
without
perceiving
it
they
become
each
day
more
and
more
men
of
their
time
and
country
more
familiar
with
the
ideas
and
liberal
tendencies
of
modern
society
thus
at
the
two
poles
of
roman
catholicism
in
its
most
elevated
ranks
and
in
its
popular
militia
the
same
result
is
obtained
in
the
one
case
by
men
of
enlightened
views
and
of
superior
ability
and
in
the
other
case
by
men
of
good
sense
and
honesty
of
purpose
and
thus
in
the
roman
church
those
moral
and
political
principles
of
make
their
way
which
form
the
basis
of
the
new
social
edifice
of
its
laws
and
of
its
liberties
i
do
not
dispute
neither
do
i
attack
i
record
facts
as
i
observe
and
appreciate
them
and
in
my
opinion
with
reference
to
french
institutions
for
i
speak
only
of
france
the
essential
consequences
from
these
facts
as
far
as
they
bear
upon
the
relations
of
christianity
to
liberty
are
as
follows
i
have
here
not
a
word
to
say
respecting
the
protestant
church
in
france
the
questions
which
have
agitated
her
for
some
time
past
are
questions
of
faith
and
internal
discipline
entirely
aloof
from
any
incertitude
or
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
rights
of
conscience
or
of
religious
society
in
their
relations
to
civil
society
protestantism
in
france
whether
orthodox
or
not
adopts
and
upholds
the
largest
maxims
as
to
religious
liberty
and
as
to
the
guarantee
for
it
in
the
separation
of
religious
life
from
civil
life
the
most
zealous
liberals
have
nothing
more
in
this
respect
to
demand
from
even
the
most
orthodox
protestants
these
are
indeed
of
their
church
the
most
urgent
in
claiming
for
religious
society
the
right
to
have
its
internal
autonomy
and
to
stand
independently
of
the
state
it
is
on
the
contrary
roman
catholics
and
the
advocates
of
the
essential
principles
of
modern
society
who
most
dispute
about
the
general
question
of
liberty
the
more
i
reflect
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
henceforth
this
question
can
only
be
seriously
and
efficaciously
dealt
with
in
one
of
two
ways
the
one
is
by
the
alliance
of
church
and
state
on
conditions
which
whilst
distinguishing
civil
life
from
religious
life
shall
guarantee
to
individuals
religious
liberty
in
civil
society
and
to
the
church
itself
its
internal
autonomy
in
matters
of
faith
and
of
religious
discipline
the
other
solution
is
the
complete
separation
of
church
and
state
and
their
mutual
independence
that
the
church
prefers
the
system
of
an
alliance
with
the
state
to
that
of
the
church
liberty
and
isolation
from
the
state
i
well
understand
she
is
right
alliance
with
the
state
is
to
her
a
sign
of
strength
a
means
of
influence
a
pledge
for
her
dignity
and
her
stability
the
complete
separation
of
the
two
societies
leaves
religious
institutions
and
particularly
their
clergy
in
a
fluctuating
and
precarious
situation
a
system
essentially
democratic
it
rather
places
the
ecclesiastical
magistracy
under
the
opinions
and
wills
of
its
lay
members
than
these
under
the
influence
of
the
religious
authorities
this
system
is
especially
alien
to
the
origin
the
fundamental
principle
and
the
hierarchy
of
the
roman
catholic
church
it
is
impossible
for
this
church
to
accept
it
unless
urgently
demanded
by
the
interests
of
moral
authority
independence
and
liberty
but
let
not
the
roman
catholic
church
misapprehend
an
alliance
of
church
with
state
has
also
conditions
without
which
a
church
would
vainly
expect
any
advantage
for
the
alliance
to
be
serious
and
effectual
there
must
be
between
church
and
state
a
large
measure
of
harmony
as
to
the
essential
principles
of
the
religious
society
and
of
the
civil
society
which
the
church
and
the
state
respectively
represent
if
the
two
societies
and
those
who
govern
them
do
not
mutually
admit
their
respective
principles
if
they
disavow
each
other
incessantly
and
carry
on
in
the
bosom
of
their
alliance
a
war
open
or
secret
all
the
good
effect
of
such
alliance
disappears
and
the
alliance
itself
is
soon
compromised
the
treaties
concluded
at
different
epochs
under
the
name
of
concordats
between
chambers
and
states
in
different
countries
of
christendom
have
only
been
possible
and
efficacious
because
there
was
a
great
basis
of
harmony
in
the
fundamental
institutions
of
the
two
contracting
parties
they
differed
upon
some
points
they
had
reciprocally
to
make
concessions
and
grant
guarantees
but
taken
altogether
they
approved
of
each
other
and
were
sincere
in
supporting
each
other
peace
was
the
point
from
which
their
alliance
started
and
the
dissentiments
which
existed
on
each
side
had
no
reference
to
any
vital
questions
it
suffices
for
us
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
history
of
catholicism
in
france
of
the
anglican
church
in
england
of
the
lutheran
church
in
germany
and
in
sweden
to
acknowledge
this
truth
and
what
is
occurring
and
forming
matter
of
negotiation
in
our
days
in
italy
and
in
austria
upon
the
subject
of
the
relations
of
the
church
with
the
state
furnishes
a
further
striking
confirmation
in
an
age
of
liberty
of
publicity
and
of
continual
discussion
when
it
is
possible
for
anything
to
be
thought
or
said
and
for
any
opinion
to
be
maintained
or
attacked
it
is
more
than
ever
indispensable
that
any
treaty
between
church
and
state
should
be
serious
and
sincere
that
is
to
say
that
the
two
contracting
parties
should
recognise
and
accept
in
each
other
without
equivocation
and
without
subterfuge
the
character
which
each
really
possesses
this
is
the
only
condition
upon
which
an
alliance
can
be
real
becoming
and
advantageous
in
presence
of
the
undisguised
movements
and
the
ever
recurring
and
daring
ventures
of
liberty
a
policy
of
reticence
and
procrastination
obscure
and
dim
reservations
inconsistent
expedients
and
secret
warfare
is
no
longer
practicable
such
policy
far
from
lending
any
help
discredits
and
weakens
the
power
which
places
its
trust
in
it
as
for
me
i
believe
that
the
catholic
church
if
not
without
endangering
her
habits
at
least
without
endangering
her
essential
principles
has
it
in
her
power
to
set
herself
at
peace
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
modern
society
and
of
actual
civil
governments
but
should
she
either
not
wish
or
not
know
how
to
march
towards
this
object
and
to
obtain
it
let
her
not
give
way
to
any
illusion
alliance
with
the
state
would
be
rather
a
source
of
weakness
and
of
peril
to
her
than
an
advantage
and
she
would
only
eventually
be
driven
to
seek
a
refuge
in
the
system
of
separation
and
complete
independence
as
for
the
state
the
system
which
separates
the
two
societies
would
free
it
from
many
a
burthen
and
much
embarrassment
but
it
would
cause
her
other
embarrassments
and
lead
to
the
loss
of
many
advantages
it
is
convenient
to
discourse
of
the
principle
of
a
free
church
in
a
free
country
but
after
the
long
alliance
which
has
existed
between
them
it
is
easier
to
proclaim
such
principle
than
to
apply
it
not
only
is
it
impossible
to
divorce
church
from
state
without
violently
wrenching
asunder
previous
bonds
but
more
lasting
consequences
ensue
once
disengaged
from
every
connection
with
the
civil
power
ministers
of
religion
busy
themselves
no
longer
about
the
interests
of
civil
society
their
thoughts
are
exclusively
absorbed
by
questions
of
religion
and
its
affairs
governments
have
long
been
accustomed
to
derive
and
derive
at
the
present
day
a
moral
influence
of
great
value
from
an
alliance
with
the
church
but
this
influence
supposes
one
condition
which
is
not
only
especially
important
in
our
days
but
of
capital
importance
in
the
actual
state
of
opinion
and
of
manners
no
good
results
can
be
politically
looked
for
from
the
alliance
if
the
civil
power
do
not
abstain
from
all
interference
in
questions
purely
religious
the
complete
independence
of
the
church
and
of
its
chiefs
in
matters
of
faith
and
of
religious
discipline
is
the
only
condition
which
can
justify
their
giving
their
indirect
support
to
the
state
government
and
which
can
purge
their
support
of
all
impure
motives
the
alliance
of
the
two
powers
could
formerly
in
a
certain
degree
with
no
inconsiderable
confusion
in
their
respective
attributes
and
a
somewhat
earnest
claim
on
the
part
of
each
to
domineer
over
the
other
nothing
similar
can
occur
at
the
present
day
neither
church
nor
state
can
any
longer
be
the
master
or
the
servant
of
the
other
let
neither
princes
nor
priests
deceive
themselves
their
reciprocal
independence
and
their
uncontested
empire
each
in
its
own
province
can
alone
give
to
their
alliance
the
dignity
which
the
alliance
requires
if
it
is
to
be
real
efficacious
and
lasting
every
road
leads
me
to
the
same
point
to
every
question
the
facts
give
me
the
same
answer
liberty
has
need
of
christianity
christianity
has
need
of
liberty
as
modern
society
demands
to
be
free
the
religion
of
christ
is
its
most
necessary
ally
christianity
and
civil
society
have
mutually
i
admit
it
a
grave
feeling
of
disquietude
and
distrust
but
this
disquietude
and
distrust
are
not
natural
and
inevitable
results
of
principles
essential
to
civil
society
and
religious
society
of
any
compulsory
relations
existing
between
them
they
spring
from
the
faults
which
the
two
institutions
have
committed
towards
each
other
and
from
the
contest
which
each
has
forced
upon
the
other
liberty
alone
can
effectually
combat
such
sentiments
which
have
become
habitual
and
traditional
to
dissipate
them
entirely
something
besides
liberty
is
requisite
but
without
liberty
neither
religious
society
nor
civil
society
will
obtain
their
legitimate
objects
these
objects
being
peace
in
their
relations
to
each
other
and
the
moral
progress
of
man
and
of
the
state
whether
allied
with
or
independent
of
the
church
second
meditation
christianity
and
morality
two
attempts
are
now
being
simultaneously
made
of
different
characters
although
of
the
same
origin
and
tendency
seriously
minded
men
who
persist
in
believing
and
calling
themselves
christians
are
labouring
to
separate
christian
morals
from
christian
dogmas
and
although
they
make
jesus
their
moral
idea
of
humanity
are
stripping
him
of
his
miracles
and
divinity
others
who
declare
openly
that
they
are
no
christians
endeavour
to
separate
morality
in
the
abstract
from
religion
in
the
abstract
and
place
the
source
of
morality
as
well
as
its
authority
in
human
nature
and
in
it
alone
on
the
one
side
we
find
a
christian
morality
independent
of
christian
faith
on
the
other
a
morality
independent
of
all
religious
belief
either
natural
or
revealed
these
two
doctrines
are
in
our
days
proclaimed
and
propagated
with
ardour
i
frankly
admit
that
their
defenders
are
sincere
in
adopting
and
upholding
them
and
that
they
do
so
in
the
name
of
truth
alone
in
philosophy
as
in
politics
i
believe
error
and
honest
intentions
to
be
more
general
than
falsehood
and
evil
design
moreover
who
would
discuss
convictions
unless
himself
convinced
that
they
are
serious
and
earnest
opinions
founded
on
interested
or
hypocritical
motives
are
not
worth
the
honour
of
a
discussion
they
merit
only
to
be
attacked
and
unmasked
in
the
name
of
truth
alone
i
combat
the
two
doctrines
to
which
i
have
alluded
and
which
some
now
strive
to
accredit
the
true
cause
of
this
twofold
attempt
is
the
incredulity
and
the
scepticism
which
prevail
with
regard
to
religion
are
numerous
few
deists
are
quite
sure
of
their
belief
and
of
its
efficacy
a
necessity
for
morality
is
felt
to
exist
its
right
to
regulate
the
actions
of
man
is
acknowledged
it
is
in
order
to
preserve
to
it
its
integrity
and
its
force
that
efforts
are
made
to
separate
it
from
religion
from
all
religious
creeds
all
of
which
it
is
here
assumed
are
either
ruined
or
tottering
thus
independent
morality
is
as
it
were
a
raft
offered
to
the
human
soul
and
to
human
society
to
save
their
vessel
from
being
wrecked
the
idea
is
false
the
attempt
of
evil
consequence
they
who
flatter
themselves
that
they
can
leave
christian
morality
standing
after
wrenching
it
from
christian
dogmas
and
they
who
believe
it
possible
to
preserve
morality
after
detaching
it
from
religion
err
alike
for
they
fail
to
recognise
the
essential
facts
of
human
nature
and
of
human
society
both
doctrines
are
derived
from
an
inexact
and
incomplete
observation
of
these
facts
i
have
already
stated
in
these
meditations
what
i
think
of
the
isolation
of
christian
morality
from
christianity
and
the
reason
why
i
reject
it
at
present
i
apply
myself
to
the
idea
of
independent
morality
and
in
the
name
of
a
psychology
pure
at
once
and
severe
i
affirm
that
there
exists
an
intimate
legitimate
and
necessary
union
between
morality
and
religion
a
preliminary
observation
occurs
to
me
those
who
adopt
the
theory
of
an
independent
morality
start
from
the
idea
that
there
is
a
moral
law
strange
to
and
superior
to
all
interested
motives
to
all
selfish
passions
these
rank
duty
above
and
treat
it
as
independent
of
every
other
motive
of
action
i
am
far
from
contesting
this
principle
with
them
but
they
forget
that
it
been
and
still
strongly
contested
contested
by
both
ancient
and
modern
philosophers
some
have
considered
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
the
satisfaction
of
individual
interests
as
the
right
and
legitimate
aims
of
human
life
others
have
placed
the
rule
of
man
conduct
not
in
personal
interests
but
in
general
utility
in
the
common
welfare
of
all
mankind
others
have
thought
that
they
could
perceive
the
origin
and
the
guarantee
for
morals
in
the
sympathy
of
human
sentiments
the
moral
and
obligatory
law
or
duty
is
far
from
being
the
recognised
and
generally
accepted
basis
of
morality
systems
the
most
varied
have
arisen
and
are
incessantly
forming
themselves
with
respect
to
the
principles
of
morals
as
with
respect
to
other
great
questions
of
our
nature
and
the
human
understanding
fluctuates
no
less
in
this
corner
of
the
philosophic
arena
than
in
the
others
let
the
moralists
of
the
new
school
not
deceive
themselves
in
proclaiming
morality
to
be
independent
of
religion
they
mean
to
give
it
one
fixed
basis
the
same
for
all
and
they
believe
that
they
succeed
in
the
attempt
they
deceive
themselves
morality
thus
isolated
remains
as
much
as
ever
a
prey
to
the
disputes
of
man
i
pass
over
this
grave
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
defenders
of
the
system
and
i
examine
the
system
itself
let
us
see
if
it
is
the
faithful
and
full
expression
of
human
morality
if
it
contains
all
the
facts
which
constitute
its
natural
and
essential
elements
these
facts
i
sum
up
as
follows
the
distinction
between
moral
good
and
evil
the
obligation
of
doing
good
and
avoiding
evil
the
faculty
of
accomplishing
or
not
this
obligation
in
brief
and
philosophic
terms
the
moral
law
duty
and
liberty
these
are
the
natural
primitive
and
universal
facts
which
constitute
human
morality
it
is
by
reason
and
by
virtue
of
these
facts
that
man
is
a
moral
being
i
have
not
here
to
enter
into
a
discussion
of
these
same
facts
i
do
not
occupy
myself
at
this
moment
with
systems
which
disregard
or
deny
them
in
whole
or
in
part
all
the
three
facts
or
any
one
of
the
three
the
partisans
of
the
system
of
independent
morality
admit
them
all
as
i
do
the
question
between
them
and
myself
is
this
whether
or
not
whilst
rendering
homage
to
the
true
principle
of
morality
they
fully
comprehend
its
signification
and
accept
its
results
it
is
the
characteristic
and
the
honour
of
man
that
he
is
not
satisfied
with
merely
gathering
facts
which
relate
either
to
himself
or
to
the
external
world
but
that
he
seeks
to
know
their
origin
and
object
their
import
and
bearing
in
morals
as
in
physics
statistics
are
only
the
point
from
which
science
sets
out
it
is
only
after
having
well
observed
facts
and
having
verified
them
that
we
have
to
discuss
the
questions
which
they
raise
and
the
further
ultimate
facts
which
the
facts
already
ascertained
contain
and
reveal
the
fact
of
human
morality
such
as
i
have
just
described
it
in
its
three
constituent
elements
the
moral
law
duty
and
liberty
can
not
fail
to
suggest
these
two
questions
whence
proceeds
the
moral
law
and
whence
is
its
authority
what
is
the
sense
and
what
the
ultimate
result
to
the
moral
being
himself
of
the
fulfilment
or
violation
of
his
duty
that
is
to
say
of
the
use
which
he
makes
of
his
liberty
no
philosophical
system
can
either
suppress
or
elude
these
questions
they
present
themselves
to
the
mind
of
man
as
soon
as
he
directs
his
attention
to
the
moral
character
of
man
nature
i
propose
to
consider
in
succession
the
three
constituent
elements
of
this
great
truth
so
as
to
determine
rightly
its
source
and
bearing
moral
law
has
neither
been
invented
by
man
nor
does
it
spring
from
any
human
convention
man
by
acknowledging
it
admits
that
he
has
not
created
it
that
he
can
not
abolish
or
change
it
political
and
civil
laws
are
diverse
and
ever
varying
they
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
time
place
social
circumstances
or
human
will
when
men
adopt
or
reject
them
they
do
so
with
the
feeling
that
they
are
the
masters
of
them
to
deal
with
them
accordingly
as
their
interests
or
their
fancies
suggest
but
when
a
law
presents
itself
to
them
in
the
form
of
a
moral
law
they
feel
that
this
is
not
dependent
on
them
that
it
takes
its
source
and
derives
its
authority
elsewhere
than
from
their
own
opinion
or
volition
they
may
mistake
in
rendering
or
in
refusing
homage
to
a
particular
precept
of
conduct
they
may
attach
to
laws
a
moral
value
which
they
do
not
intrinsically
possess
or
pass
unnoticed
the
really
moral
character
of
another
law
and
the
obligations
which
it
imposes
upon
them
but
wherever
they
believe
that
they
perceive
the
character
of
a
moral
law
they
bow
before
it
as
before
something
which
does
not
emanate
from
them
and
before
a
power
of
a
different
nature
from
man
the
moral
law
no
more
belongs
to
the
general
mechanism
of
the
world
than
to
the
invention
of
man
it
has
none
of
the
characteristics
that
mark
the
laws
of
physical
order
none
of
the
results
which
follow
from
them
it
is
by
no
means
inherent
in
the
forms
or
combinations
of
matter
it
does
not
govern
the
relations
or
movements
of
bodies
obligatory
and
fixed
as
fate
it
addresses
itself
solely
to
that
intelligent
and
free
being
of
whom
pascal
said
in
his
grand
language
if
the
universe
were
to
crush
him
still
man
would
be
more
noble
than
that
which
destroyed
him
because
he
knows
that
he
dies
and
of
the
advantage
that
the
universe
has
over
him
the
universe
knows
nothing
man
does
much
more
than
know
that
he
dies
it
happens
sometimes
that
he
encounters
death
voluntarily
that
he
chooses
to
die
in
obedience
to
the
moral
law
it
is
the
law
of
liberty
what
mean
these
words
law
of
liberty
how
does
this
law
called
duty
come
to
establish
itself
in
the
human
mind
and
command
man
liberty
to
respect
it
some
essay
to
found
duty
upon
right
and
to
derive
its
authority
solely
from
the
independence
and
dignity
of
humanity
man
it
is
said
feels
and
knows
that
he
is
a
free
agent
as
such
it
is
his
right
that
no
human
being
shall
attack
his
independence
or
his
dignity
he
finds
in
every
other
human
being
the
same
nature
and
therefore
the
same
right
as
he
possesses
himself
thus
mutual
right
is
derived
from
individual
right
and
duty
is
nothing
but
the
right
which
it
is
recognised
that
another
possesses

the

melancholy
pleasure
of
citing
upon

a
few
words
of
a
person
whose
mind
and

were
united
to

and
who
in
a
modest
essay
threw
over
this
important
subject
a
flood
of
light
as
vivid
as
it
is
pure
the
word
right
brings
with
it
the
idea
of
a
relation
to
something
as
every
right
is
an
application
of
a
moral
law
to
the
different
relations
of
society
there
exists
not
a
right
of
which
society
is
not
the
occasion
a
right
is
only
the
moral
power
of
an
individual
over
the
liberty
of
another
a
power
attributed
to
him
by
virtue
of
the
moral
law
which
regulates
the
relations
of
men
with
one
another
duty
is
the
sole
basis
of
right
did
there
exist
no

there
would
exist
no

there
is
no
claim
of
a

which
does
not
affirm
a
duty
to
be
its
source
duty
applied
as
a
rule
to
govern
the
relations
of
man
to
man
constitutes
justice
justice
can
not
exist
without
duty
a
thing
is
neither
just
nor
unjust
as
far
as
regards
the
being
who
has
not
had
the
duty
prescribed
to
him
of
distinguishing
between
them
ideas
of
right
are
as
essential
to
men
as
ideas
of
duty
for
if
the
idea
of
duty
is
the
social
bond
the
means
of
peace
and
of
union
amongst
mankind
the
idea
of
right
constitutes
the
arms
offensive
and
defensive
which
society
gives
to
men
for
reciprocal
use
every
man
has
a
consciousness
of
his
own
rights
which
aids
him
to
keep
others
in
the
line
of
their
duty
but
rights
only
so
far
aid
him
to
do
this
as
the
duty
upon
which
they
are
founded
is
known
and
respected
for
with
regard
to
that
man
who
ignores
his
duty
the
man
who
has
a
right
has
absolutely
nothing
right
is
a
moral
power
producing
its
effects
without
the
help
of
physical
force
if
he
who
has
both
right
and
power
must
employ
the
power
to
enforce
his
right
it
is
no
longer
his
right
which
triumphs
it
is
his
power
his
right
remains
to
him
to
justify
the
employment
of
force
but
it
is
not
his
right
which
has
made
his
cause
triumph
thus
it
is
that
the
idea
of
duty
is
the
basis
of
society
and
is
at
the
same
time
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
right
an
idea
which
in
its
turn
contributes
also
to
the
stability
of
society
to
found
society
upon
the
sole
idea
of
duty
is
to
deprive
society
of
one
of
its
most
powerful
means
of
defence
and
of
development
to
strip
the
tree
of
the

serve
to
give
it
at
once
strength
and
amplitude
to

upon
the

this

commit

the

occupying
an

in

to
which
the
notion
of

is
completely
strange
is
it
on

of
the

it
as
their

it
by

their

is
no
more
an
explanation
of
sympathy
than
of
duty
i
am
touching
upon
the
source
of
their
error
if
they
make
the
principle
of
human
morality
consist
in
a
right
emanating
from
man
liberty
and
man
intelligence
it
is
that
they
see
in
man
only
a
free
and
intelligent
being
strange
ignorance
and
mutilation
of
man
nature
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
a
free
and
intelligent
being
man
is
a
being
dependent
and
subject
he
is
dependent
in
the
material
order
upon
a
power
superior
to
his
own
and
subject
in
the
moral
order
to
a
law
which
he
did
not
make
which
he
can
not
change
which
he
is
forced
to
admit
even
whilst
he
is
free
not
to
obey
it
a
law
from
which
he
can
not
withdraw
himself
without
troubling
his
soul
and
endangering
his
future
morality
in
a
sense
is
in
effect
independent
it
is
essentially
independent
of
man
man
the
free
agent
man
is
its
subject
morality
is
truly
the
law
of
liberty
of
action
liberty
is
not
an
isolated
fact
which
exhausts
itself
by
working
its
own
completion
and
which
once
accomplished
remains
without
further
consequences
to
liberty
is
attached
responsibility
when
the
human
being
giving
effect
to
his
free
will
resolves
and
acts
he
feels
that
he
is
responsible
for
his
resolution
and
his
act
the
laws
of
society
declare
this
to
him
in
express
terms
for
they
punish
him
if
they
judge
his
act
to
be
criminal
not
merely
because
they
find
his
act
to
be
hurtful
but
because
they
find
it
to
be
morally
culpable
for
were
its
author
pronounced
to
be
mad
or
his
mind
or
volition
recognised
as
unsound
the
laws
of
society
would
acquit
him
and
if
a
culprit
escape
legal
punishment
he
does
not
escape
from
the
internal
punishment
of
remorse
without
speaking
of
penal
laws
remorse
is
at
once
the
proof
and
the
sanction
of
moral
responsibility
possible
it
is
that
all
remorse
may
be
lulled
to
sleep
in
the
mind
of
the
hardened
offender
but
there
are
a
thousand
instances
to
prove
that
it
may
be
always
reawakened
neither
in
good
nor
in
evil
is
man
nature
entirely
effaced
repentance
sometimes
hides
itself
in
recesses
so
profound
that
to
penetrate
thither
is
impossible
except
for
the
soul
which
feels
repentance
even
when
seeking
to
escape
from
it
as
liberty
supposes
responsibility
so
responsibility
supposes
an
idea
of
merit
or
of
demerit
attaching
naturally
to
the
use
made
of
liberty
i
set
aside
here
all
the
questions
in
my
opinion
ill
put
and
wrongly
solved
by
theologians
upon
this
subject
of
merit
or
demerit
according
to
the
general
sentiment
and
common
sense
of
all
mankind
there
is
merit
for
a
man
in
the
accomplishment
of
moral
law
there
is
demerit
in
its
violation
it
is
a
fact
recognised
and
proclaimed
even
in
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
incidents
of
human
life
as
well
as
in
the
political
organisation
of
society
and
in
the
problems
which
concern
the
eternal
future
however
the
recompense
or
the
punishment
may
be
accelerated
or
delayed
whatever
its
nature
or
its
measure
the
moral
career
of
a
man
is
not
complete
nor
the
moral
order
established
until
the
responsibility
inherent
in
his
liberty
has
received
its
complement
and
arrived
at
its
end
in
the
just
appreciation
and
equitable
return
made
to
him
for
his
merits
or
demerits
thus
far
i
have
spoken
of
independent
morality
i
have
scrupulously
confined
myself
to
studying
moral
facts
as
nature
and
man
nature
alone
presents
them
to
us
i
have
considered
and
described
them
as
they
are
in
themselves
entirely
apart
from
every
other
element
and
every
other
consideration
those
moral
facts
are
briefly
as
follows
the
distinction
between
moral
good
and
moral
evil
the
moral
law
the
duty
of
doing
good
and
avoiding
evil
moral
liberty
moral
responsibility
moral
merit
and
demerit
these
are
i
admit
facts
which
man
recognises
in
himself
as
the
proper
and
intimate
characteristics
of
his
own
nature
but
these
truths
once
recognised
and
determined
what
is
their
import
are
they
facts
isolated
in
human
nature
as
they
are
in
psychology
or
have
they
anterior
causes
and
necessary
consequences
are
they
or
do
they
contain
and
reveal
other
truths
which
form
their
complement
and
their
sanction
the
human
mind
can
not
elude
this
question
i
have
established
that
the
moral
law
is
not
of
human
invention
that
it
does
not
exist
merely
by
man
agreement
that
it
is
not
one
of
those
laws
of
fate
by
which
the
material
world
is
governed
it
is
the
law
of
the
intellectual
world
of
the
free
world
a
law
superior
to
that
world
which
by
recognising
it
as
law
recognises
itself
at
the
same
time
both
as
free
and
subject
who
is
the
author
of
that
law
who
imposes
it
upon
man
upon
man
of
whom
it
is
not
the
work
and
whom
it
governs
without
enslaving
who
placed
it
above
this
world
where
the
present
life
is
passed
evidently
there
must
be
a
superior
power
from
which
the
moral
law
emanates
and
of
which
it
is
a
revelation
with
the
good
sense
which
his
frivolity
and
his
cynicism
made
him
so
oft
forget
voltaire
said
speaking
of
the
material
world
and
the
order
reigning
in
it
je
ne
puis
songer
que
cette
horloge

et

i
can
not
think
this
clock
exists
and
never
had
a
maker
in
the
moral
world
we
have
to
do
with
something
far
different
from
a
clock
nor
are
we
in
the
presence
of
a
machine
constructed
regulated
once
for
all
the
law
of
order
that
is
to
say
the
moral
law
is
incessantly
in
contact
with
man
free
agency
man
does
homage
to
the
law
which
he
is
yet
at
liberty
to
accomplish
or
to
violate
the
law
is
a
manifestation
of
the
supreme
legislator
of
whose
thought
and
will
it
is
the
expression
god
moral
sovereign
and
man
free
subject
are
both
contained
in
the
fact
of
the
moral
law
in
this
fact
alone
kant
found
god
he
erred
in
not
also
finding
god
elsewhere
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
it
is
in
the
moral
law
the
rule
of
human
liberty
that
god
shows
himself
to
man
most
directly
most
clearly
most
undeniably
just
as
the
moral
law
without
a
sovereign
legislator
to
impose
it
upon
man
is
an
incomplete
and
inexplicable
fact
a
river
without
source
just
so
the
moral
responsibility
of
the
free
agent
man
without
a
supreme
judge
to
apply
it
is
an
incomplete
and
inexplicable
fact
a
source
without
outlet
which
runs
and
loses
itself
no
one
can
tell
whither
just
as
the
moral
law
reveals
the
moral
legislator
just
so
does
moral
responsibility
reveal
the
moral
judge
just
as
the
moral
law
is
no
law
of
human
invention
just
so
human
judgments
rendered
in
the
name
of
moral
responsibility
are
hardly
ever
the
judgments
perfectly
true
and
just
which
such
responsibility
expects
and
calls
for
god
is
contained
in
the
moral
law
as
its
primal
author
and
in
moral
responsibility
as
its
definitive
judge
the
moral
system
that
is
the
empire
of
the
moral
law
is
incomprehensible
and
impossible
if
there
is
no
god
there
not
only
to
establish
it
in
a
region
above
and
paramount
to
man
free
agency
but
to
establish
it
when
troubled
by
man
conduct
as
a
free
agent
thus
the
moral
truths
inherent
in
and
proper
to
the
human
nature
that
is
the
distinction
between
moral
good
and
moral
evil
moral
obligation
moral
responsibility
moral
merit
and
demerit
are
necessarily
and
intimately
connected
with
the
truths
of
religion
for
instance
with
god
moral
legislator
god
moral
spectator
god
moral
judge
thus
morality
is
naturally
and
essentially
connected
with
religion
morality
is
it
is
true
a
thing
special
and
distinct
in
the
ensemble
of
man
nature
and
of
man
life
but
it
is
in
no
respect
independent
of
the
ensemble
to
which
it
belongs
it
has
its
particular
place
in
that
ensemble
but
it
is
only
in
that
ensemble
that
its
existence
is
reasonable
thence
only
that
it
derives
its
source
and
its
authority
morals
may
in
the
order
of
science
be
separately
observed
and
described
but
in
the
order
of
actuality
morality
is
inseparable
from
religion
what
would
be
said
of
a
physiologist
if
he
maintained
that
the
heart
is
independent
of
the
brain
because
those
two
organs
are
distinct
organs
which
are
closely
united
and
indispensable
to
each
other
in
the
unity
of
the
human
being
the
spectacle
of
the
world
leads
us
to
the
same
result
as
the
study
of
man
and
reads
us
the
same
lesson
history
confirms
psychology
what
is
the
great
action
which
makes
itself
most
remarkable
upon
the
stage
of
human
societies
the
constant
struggle
of
good
with
evil
of

with
unjust
in
this
struggle
what
shocking
disorders
what
iniquity
perpetrated
how
frequent
an
interregnum
in
the
empire
of
the
moral
law
and
of
justice
and
what
vicissitudes
there
at
one
time
the
moral
decree
is
expected
in
vain
and
the
human
conscience
remains
painfully
troubled
by
the
successes
of
vice
and
of

at
another
time
contrary
to
all

in

very

victorious

its
masters
marcus
aurelius
after
having
consecrated
his
life
to
the
search

law
dies
in
profound
sadness
beneath
his
tent
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
sad
on
account
of
his
wife
sad
on
account
of
his
son
and
of
the
future
of
that
world
which
he
had
governed
and
which
was
only
to
be
renewed
and
regenerated
by
those
christians
whom
he
had
persecuted
everything
is
incomplete
imperfect
incoherent
obscure
contradictory
in
this
vast
conflict
of
men
and
actions
called
history
and
providence
the
personification
of
eternal
wisdom
and
justice
sometimes
manifests
itself
there
with
and
sometimes
remains
there
inert
and
veiled
beneath
the
most
sombre
mysteries
is
such
the
normal
definitive
state
of
the
universe
shall
truth
shall
justice
never
assume
there
more
space
than
they
now
occupy
when
shall
light
dawn
upon
the
darkness
who
restore
order
to
this
chaos
man
evidently
is
insufficient
to
the
task
in
the
world
as
in
individual
man
the
moral
principle
is
still
mutilated
and
too
infirm
for
its
mission
unless
it
is
intimately
united
to
the
religious
principle
morality
can
as
little
dispense
with
god
in
the
life
of
the
human
race
as
in
that
of
the
individual
man
in
these
days
more
than
ever
morality
has
need
of
god
i
am
far
from
thinking
ill
of
my
country
or
of
my
age
i
believe
that
they
progress
that
they
have
a
future
but
humanity
is
exposed
to
a
rude
trial
on
one
side
we
have
been
witnesses
to
events
of
the
most
contradictory
character
everything
in
the
world
of
opinion
has
been
questioned
everything
in
that
of
facts
has
been
shaken
overthrown
raised
up
again
left
tottering
oppressed
by
this
spectacle
what
remains
to
men
minds
more
than
feeble
convictions
dim
hopes
on
the
other
side
in
the
midst
of
this
universal
shock
of
minds
science
and
man
power
over
the
surrounding
world
have
been
prodigiously
extended
and
confirmed
light
has
shone
more
and
more
brightly
upon
the
material
world
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
becoming
paler
and
paler
declining
more
and
more
in
the
moral
world
we
have
plucked
and
are
still
plucking
more
actively
than
ever
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
whereas
the
rules
of
human
conduct
the
laws
of
good
and
of
evil
have
become
indistinct
in
our
thought
man
remains
divided
between
pride
and
doubt
intoxicated
by
his
power
and
disquieted
by
his
weakness
soul
how
perturbed
human
morality
how
endangered
thus
far
i
have
treated
the
subject
with
far
more
reserve
and
indulgence
for
the
opinions
of
others
than
i
intended
i
have
limited
myself
to
the
bounds
assigned
to
the
question
by
the
advocates
of
the
theory
of
independent
morality
themselves
i
have
done
nothing
more
than
set
in
broad
daylight
the
intimate
natural
and
necessary
connection
of
morals
with
religion
of
man
moral
being
with
god
moral
sovereign
i
am
only
at
the
threshold
of
the
truth
it
is
not
merely
to
religion
in
general
that
morality
pertains
it
is
not
merely
the
idea
of
god
of
which
it
has
need
it
requires
the
constant
presence
of
god
his
unceasing
action
upon
the
human
soul
it
is
from
christianity
alone
that
morality
can
now
derive
the
clearness
force
and
security
indispensable
for
the
exercise
of
its
empire
and
it
is
not
for
her
practical
utility
it
is
for
her
truth
her
intrinsic
value
that
i
hold
christianity
to
be
necessary
to
the
human
soul
and
to
human
societies
it
is
because
she
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
man
moral
nature
and
because
she
has
been
already
tested
in
man
history
that
christianity
is
the
faithful
expression
of
the
moral
law
and
the
legitimate
master
of
the
moral
being
the
first
and
the
incomparable
characteristic
of
christianity
is
the
extent
i
should
rather
say
the
immensity
of
her
moral
ambition
the
moral
system
established
by
christ
has
often
been
contrasted
with
the
reforms
aimed
at
by
great
men
whose
endeavour
it
also
was
to
fix
moral
laws
for
man
conduct
and
to
secure
their
empire
over
him
jesus
has
been
compared
to
confucius
zoroaster
socrates
mahomet
the
comparison
is
singularly
inappropriate
and
superficial
the
wisest
the
most
illustrious
of
these
moral
reformers
even
the
most
powerful
understood
and
accomplished
at
best
but
a
very
limited
and
incomplete
work
sometimes
they
only
sought
to
place
in
a
clear
light
the
rational
principles
of
morality
sometimes
they
gave
to
their
disciples
addressing
themselves
to
these
alone
rules
for
conduct
in
conformity
with
rational
principles
of
morality
they
taught
a
doctrine
or
established
rules
for
discipline
they
founded
schools
or
sects
the
christian
work
was
something
quite
different
jesus
was
not
a
philosopher
who
entered
into
discussions
with
his
disciples
and
instructed
them
in
moral
science
nor
a
chief
who
grouped
around
him
a
certain
number
of
adepts
and
subjected
them
to
certain
special
rules
which
distinguish
nay
sever
them
from
the
mass
of
mankind
jesus
expounds
no
doctrine
sets
up
no
system
of
discipline
and
organises
no
particular
society
he
penetrates
to
the
bottom
of
the
human
soul
of
every
soul
he
lays
bare
the
moral
disease
of
humanity
and
of
every
man
and
he
commands
his
disciples
with
authority
to
apply
the
cure
first
to
themselves
and
then
to
all
men
save
your
soul
for
what
would
it
profit
a
man
to
gain
the
whole
world
if
he
lose
his
own
soul
go
and
preach
to
all
nations
what
philosopher
what
reformer
ever
conceived
an
idea
so
ambitious
so
vast
ever
undertook
to
solve
so
completely
so
universally
the
moral
problem
of
man
nature
and
man
destiny
and
this
was
no
chimerical
ambition
the
mission
of
christ
has
been
pursued
and
is
still
being
pursued
in
the
world
its
onward
movement
often
crossed
interrupted
altered
never
hopelessly
arrested
and
during
the
first
three
centuries
of
christianity
it
was
in
the
name
and
solely
with
the
arms
of
faith
and
of
liberty
that
she
commenced
her
enterprise
of
vanquishing
man
and
the
world
and
in
these
days
after
the
lapse
of
nineteen
centuries
in
spite
of
the
intermixture
of
error
of
crime
and
evil
it
is
with
the
same
arms
and
with
them
alone
that
christianity
in
the
name
of
faith
and
of
liberty
and
exposed
to
fresh
and
violent
attacks
resumes
in
the
moral
world
the
same
task
and
promises
herself
fresh
success
without
attempting
indeed
to
sound
them
to
their
depths
let
me
at
least
indicate
the
causes
of
this
indomitable
vitality
of
the
christian
religion
and
show
why
the
hope
is
well
founded
which
she
entertains
in
the
midst
of
her
trials
of
the
moral
philosophers
almost
all
are
either
bitter
censors
cold
observers
or
flatterers
of
human
nature
some
of
them
proclaim
that
man
is
naturally
good
and
that
his
vices
are
solely
due
to
the
bad
institutions
of
society
some
again
regard
and
as
the
only
springs
of
human
actions
others
describe
the
errors
and
foibles
of
man
with
a
careful
sagacity
and
yet
a
sagacity
that
does
not
indispose
them
to
jeer
and
mock
at
them
as
if
they
were
actors
in
a
drama
both
amused
themselves
and
amusing
the
spectators
how
different
the
regard
and
the
sentiment
of
jesus
when
contemplating
man
how
serious
that
regard
how
profound
how
pregnant
with
effect
that
sentiment
no
illusion
no
indifference
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
man
full
he
knows
it
to
be
of
evil
and
at
the
same
time
of
good
inclined
to
revolt
against
the
moral
law
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
not
incapable
of
obeying
it
he
sees
in
man
the
original
sin
source
of
the
troubles
and
of
the
perils
of
his
soul
he
does
not
regard
the
evil
as
incurable
he
contemplates
it
with
an
emotion
at
once
severe
and
tender
and
he
attacks
it
with
a
resolution
superior
to
every
discouragement
and
prepared
for
every
sacrifice
why
should
i
not
simply
employ
christian
terms
the
most
genuine
of
any
as
well
as
the
most
impressive
jesus
lays
bare
the
sin
without
reserve
and
without
reserve
devotes
himself
to
the
sinner
salvation
what
philosopher
ever
comprehended
man
so
well
and
loved
him
so
well
even
whilst
judging
him
so
freely
and
so
austerely
jesus
does
not
occupy
himself
less
with
man
futurity
than
with
man
nature
at
the
same
time
that
he
lays
down
in
all
its
rigour
the
principle
of
the
moral
law
the
pure
accomplishment
of
duty
he
forgets
not
that
man
has
need
of
happiness
and
thirsts
after
happiness
after
a
happiness
pure
and
lasting
he
opens
to
virtue
the
prospect
of
its
attainment
he
holds
out
a
hope
foreign
to
all
worldly
objects
hope
of
an
ideal
happiness
inaccessible
to
the
curiosity
of
man
mind
but
apt
to
satisfy
the
aspirations
of
his
soul
and
not
as
it
were
a
conquest
to
be
effected
by
merit
nor
the
acquittal
of
a
debt
but
a
recompense
to
be
accorded
to
the
virtuous
efforts
of
man
by
the
equitable
benevolence
of
god
the
christian
religion
at
the
same
time
that
it
compels
man
during
this
life
to
constant
and
laborious
exertion
has
in
store
for
him
if
only
he
labour
in
accordance
to
the
law
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
promises
of
eternal
life
thus
jesus
knows
human
nature
entirely
and
satisfies
it
he
keeps
simultaneously
in
view
man
duties
and
his
necessities
his
weaknesses
and
his
merits
he
does
not
allow
the
curtain
to
fall
upon
the
rude
scenes
of
life
and
the
sad
spectacles
of
the
world
without
any
he
has
a
prospect
and
a
futurity
and
a
satisfaction
for
man
superior
to
his
trials
and
superior
to
his
disappointments
in
what
manner
does
jesus
attain
this
result
how
does
he
touch
all
the
chords
of
man
soul
and
respond
to
all
its
appeals
by
the
intimate
union
of
morality
with
religion
of
the
moral
law
with
moral
responsibility
sole
view
complete
at
once
and
definitive
of
the
nature
and
destiny
of
humanity
sole
efficacious
solution
of
the
problems
which
weigh
upon
the
thought
and
life
of
man
i
say
the
sole
efficacious
solution
efficacy
is
in
truth
the
peculiar
the
essential
characteristic
of
christianity
however
the
ambition
of
philosophy
is
it
is
infinitely
less
so
than
that
of
religion
the
ambition
of
philosophers
is
purely
scientific
they
study
observe
discuss
their
labours
produce
systems
schools
the
christian
religion
is
a
practical
work
not
a
scientific
study
at
the
base
of
its
dogmas
and
of
its
precepts
there
is
certainly
a
philosophy
and
in
my
opinion
the
true
philosophy
but
this
philosophy
is
only
the
point
from
which
christianity
departs
not
its
object
the
object
is
to
induce
the
human
soul
to
govern
itself
according
to
the
divine
law
and
to
attain
this
object
it
deals
with
man
nature
as
it
is
in
its
entirety
with
all
its
different
elements
all
its
sublime
aspirations
there
to
borrow
the
language
of
strategy
we
see
the
basis
of
operation
of
christianity
the
basis
upon
which
it
enters
upon
its
moral
struggle
and
upon
which
it
undertakes
to
ensure
the
triumph
in
man
of
good
over
evil
and
to
procure
the
salvation
of
man
by
his
reformation
when
i
published
two
years
ago
the
second
series
of
these
meditations
the
subject
of
which
is
the
actual
state
of
the
christian
religion
i
essayed
to
characterise
therein
the
fundamental
errors
of
the
different
philosophical
systems
which
combat
it
i
sent
according
to
my
custom
the
volume
to
my
companion
in
life
and
my
at
the
institute
cousin
with
whom
notwithstanding
our
differences
of
opinion
i
maintained
always
very
friendly
relations
on
the
june
he
wrote
to
me
from
the
sorbonne
the
following
letter
my
dear
friend
as
soon
as
i
received
your
book
i
hastened
to
read
it
and
i
tell
you
very
sincerely
that
i
am
very
content
with
it
the
little
difference
between
our
opinions
which
you
have
not
pretended
to
conceal
are
inevitable
because
they
are
the
consequence
of
a
general
dissimilarity
in
the
manner
in
which
we
form
our
conceptions
of
the
nature
of
philosophy
and
of
the
nature
of
religion
these
two
great
powers
may
and
ought
to
be
in
accord
still
they
are
different
to
religion
belongs
an
influence
of
an
elevated
and
universal
kind
to
philosophy
an
influence
more
restricted
and
still
very
elevated
the
one
addresses
itself
to
the
entire
soul
comprising
in
it
the
imagination
the
other
only
addresses
itself
to
the
reason
the
first
sets
out
from
mysteries
without
which
there
is
no
religion
the
second
sets
out
from
clear
and
distinct
ideas
as
has
been
said
both
by
descartes
and
by
bossuet
this
distinction
is
the
foundation
of
my
philosophy
and
of
my
religion
and
this
distinction
is
also
in
my
view
the
principle
of
their
harmony
to
confound
them
is
i
think
an
infallible
mode
of
confusing
them
each
by
the
other
as
malebranche
has
done
to
absorb
philosophy
in
religion
gave
in
pascal
the
result
of
a
faith
full
of
contradiction
and
of
anguish
to
absorb
religion
in
philosophy
is
an
extravagant
enterprise
of
which
sound
philosophy
must
disapprove
to
admit
them
both
each
in
its
place
is
truth
grandeur
and
peace
hence
you
perceive
the
reason
of
our
differences
of
opinion
which
are
no
more
hurtful
to
our
union
than
they
are
to
our
old
and
sincere
friendship
i
replied
to
him
on
the
of
june
i
count
as
well
as
you
my
dear
friend
upon
our
dissentiments
not
being
hurtful
to
our
old
and
sincere
friendship
and
i
feel
the
more
pleasure
in
so
counting
because
independently
of
our
particular
and
petty
dissentiments
there
is
as
you
say
between
us
a
general
a
profound
difference
of
opinion
i
think
as
you
do
that
philosophy
is
not
to
be
confounded
or
absorbed
in
religion
nor
religion
in
philosophy
i
regard
them
both
as
free
in
their
manifestations
and
in
their
influence
but
i
do
not
found
their
distinction
or
their
accord
upon
the
same
grounds
as
you
do
to
me
philosophy
is
but
a
science
that
is
the
work
of
man
limited
in
its
sphere
and
reach
as
is
man
mind
itself
religion
in
its
principle
and
its
history
is
of
divine
origin
and
institution
the
one
springs
from
man
avidity
of
knowledge
the
other
is
the
light
coming
from
god
shines
upon
every
man
that
comes
into
the
world
and
which
god
continues
to
maintain
and
to
shed
over
the
world
according
to
his
impenetrable
designs
by
the
act
general
or
special
of
his
free
will
i
will
not
say
more
we
know
both
of
us
how
far
our
opinions
are
in
the
same
road
and
where
is
the
point
of
divergence
i
had
left
paris
when
i
received
cousin
letter
he
was
at
cannes
when
i
returned
to
paris
we
never
saw
each
other
afterwards
he
has
preceded
me
to
that
region
where
light
is
shed
upon
the
mysteries
of
this
life
but
in
our
last
correspondence
we
had
each
touched
in
a
few
words
upon
the
knot
of
the
whole
question
it
is
this
what
are
the
points
of
resemblance
and
what
of
difference
between
religion
and
science
between
christianity
and
philosophy
although
cousin
and
i
agreed
as
to
the
reciprocal
rights
of
these
two
influences
to
liberty
of
action
we
entertained
different
sentiments
as
to
their
origin
and
their
nature
and
consequently
as
to
the
boundaries
of
their
empire
and
the
character
of
their
mission
third
meditation
christianity
and
science
it
is
the
faith
of
christians
and
the
point
from
which
christianity
starts
that
the
scriptures
which
render
an
account
of
its
origin
its
dogmas
and
its
precepts
are
divinely
inspired
not
that
christians
understand
by
these
words
that
divine
action
upon
the
mind
of
man
so
often
called
inspiration
and
of
which
cicero
said
no
one
has
ever
been
a
great
man
without
some
divine
inspiration
footnote
and
of
which
plato
was
thinking
when
he
said
it
is
not
by
art
that
they
make
these
noble
poems
but
because

the
inspiration
of
the
holy
book
of
christianity
is
quite
a
different
thing
it
is
special
and
supernatural
there
is
divine
inspiration
in
all
the
great
works
of
man
these
books
are
a
work
directly
and
personally
inspired
by
god
they
affirm
this
themselves
the
language
used
by
jesus
in
the
gospels
incessantly
implies
it
and
in
numerous
passages
the
epistles
of
peter
and
paul
as
well
as
the
acts
of
the
apostles
declare
it
positively

to

chosen
by

to
them

his

vol

this
christian
principle
of
the
special
and
divine
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
was
not
originally
taken
in
so
narrow
an
acceptation
as
in
later
times
in
the
first
ages
of
the
christian
era
the
christians
of
the
school
of
plato
whilst
carefully
distinguishing
the
inspiration
of
the
sacred
volumes
from
the
inspiration
of
the
great
poets
strove
to
determine
the
process
common
to
these
two
kinds
of
inspiration
and
to
explain
one
by
the
other
it
is
not
by
any
effect
of
nature
nor
by
any
human
faculty
says
justin
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
men
to
know
things
so
grand
and
so
divine
it
is
by
the
grace
which
descends
from
on
high
upon
the
saints
they
have
no
need
for
any
art
to
be
revealed
to
them
pure
themselves
they
must
offer
themselves
to
the
action
of
the
divine
spirit
in
order
that
the
divine
bow
descending
itself
from
heaven
and
making
use
of
the
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
musician
does
of
the
chords
of
a
harp
or

may
unfold
to
us
the
knowledge
of
things
divine
i
think
says
athenagoras
that
you
are
not
ignorant
of
moses
or
of
isaiah
or
of
the
other
prophets
who
being
turned
aside
from
any
process
of
individual
reasoning
and
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
proclaimed
aloud
that
which
echoed
within
them
the
holy
spirit
employing
them
and
attaching
itself
to
them
as
the
player
adds
to
his
flute
the
breath
which
makes
it
discourse
its
music
questions
soon
began
to
be
agitated
in
christendom
as
to
which
of
the
religious
books
in
circulation
were
really
inspired
and
as
to
which
did
not
possess
this
divine
characteristic
hence
proceeded
disputes
in
respect
to
the
apocryphal
books
and
the
formation
of
the
canon
or
collection
of
the
holy
scriptures
but
even
in
the
very
books
received
by
all
as
divinely
inspired
great
christian
doctors
not
merely
origen
but
jerome
and
augustin
discovered
grammatical
errors
and
faults
which
it
was
impossible
to
attribute
to
divine
inspiration
and
they
distinguished
with
greater
or
less
exactness
the
inspiration
of
god
from
the
imperfection
of
man
jerome
points
out
solecisms
in
the
epistles
of
paul
and
augustin
says
in
speaking
of
john
i
venture
to
say
that
john
perhaps
has
not
spoken
of
the
thing
as
it
really
was
but
only
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
speak
for
he
is
a
man
and
he
speaks
of
god
inspired
no
doubt
by
god
but
still
a
man
when
we
meet
with
such
diversity
of
expressions
although
not
in
themselves
contradictory
used
by
the
evangelists
we
should
regard
in
the
words
of
each
only
the
intent
with
which
the
words
are
pronounced
and
not
like
wretched
cavillers
attach
an
idea
of
truth
to
the
external
form
of
the
letter
for
we
must
seek
the
very
spirit
not
only
in
all
the
words
but
in
everything
else
which
serve
as
symptoms
of
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
it
was
in
the
presence
and
in
spite
of
these
discussions
of
this
explanation
and
of
this
free
criticism
that
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
was
nevertheless
upheld
in
the
fourth
century
as
the
common
and
positive
faith
of
christians
i
pass
by
the
twelve
following
centuries
a
long
period
full
of
darkness
but
yet
with
flashes
of
light
silent
yet
full
of
uproar
full
of

and
oppression
period
beginning
with
the
invasion
of
the
barbarians
and
terminating
with
the
renaissance
that
period
in
short
which
taken
together
is
called
the
middle
age
i
transport
myself
at
once
to
the
sixteenth
century
that
epoch
of
political
struggles
when
men
reduced
to
systems
and
reasoned
upon
the
different
elements
of
moral
and
social
institutions
for
they
had
ever
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
been
fermenting
in
europe
which
although
so
small
was
yet
destined
to
conquer
and
civilize
that
globe
termed
by
us
the
world
striving
to
discover
what
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
and
events
had
become
of
the
principle
of
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
sacred
books
that
base
of
the
religious
faith
and
rule
of
christian
societies
i
find
that
this
question
had
received
two
solutions
one
in
the
name
of
the
church
of
rome
by
its
representative
the
council
of
trent
the
other
in
the
name
of

churches
by
their
great
founders
and
teachers
the
council
of

receives
all
the
books
both
of
the
old
and
of
the
new
testament
since
the
same
god
is
the
author
of
each
surrounds
them
with
the
same
respect
and
with
an
equally
pious
reverence
inserts
in

the

anathematises

god
does

so
elevated
so
pure
so
strange
to
imperfection
so
untroubled
by
any
human
nature
so
immutable
and
serene
in
the
plenitude

divine
nature
so
really
god
in

in

mythology
as
he
is
presented
to
us
in

bible
on
the
other
hand
in
no
nation
in
no
historical
narrative
or
document
does
man
show
himself
more
violent
and
ruder
more
brutal
more
cruel
more
prompt
to
ingratitude
and
more
rebellious
to
his
god
than
he
is
amongst

hebrews
nowhere
else
and
in
no
history
is
the
distance
so
great
between
the
divine
sphere
and
the
human
region
between
the
sovereign
and
the
subject
still
israel
never
entirely
separates
itself
from
god
and
in
spite
of
vices
and
excesses
israel
returns
to
god
and
recognises
his
law
and
empire
even
whilst
incessantly
violating
them
nowhere
on
the
other
hand
does
god
appear
in
his
turn
so
occupied
with
man
does
he
at
once
exact
so
much
from
him
and
yet
evince
so
much
sympathy
for
him
he
does
not
change
him
suddenly
by
any
act
of
his
sovereign
will
he
is
a
witness
to
all
his
imperfections
all
his
weaknesses
and
all
his
errors
nevertheless
he
abandons
him
not
he
holds
ever
steadily
before
him
the
torch
of
heavenly
light
and
never
omits
to
interest
himself
in
his
destiny
the
religious
and
moral
idea
is
ever
present

dominant
nowhere
else
have
the
business

one

sublimity
the

to

certain
place
his

him

which
he
is
placed
with
all
his
barbarism
and
imperfections
i
proceed
therefore
to
consider
some
of
the
particular
examples
presented
by
the
scriptures
which
make
this
great
truth
so
evident
as
to
be
incontestable
i
open
the
book
of
genesis
and
read
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
god
did
tempt
abraham
and
said
unto
him
abraham
and
he
said
behold
here
i
am
and
he
said
take
now
thy
son
thine
only
son
isaac
whom
thou
lovest
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
moriah
and
offer
him
there
for
a
upon
one
of
the
mountains
which
i
will
tell
thee
of
and
abraham
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
ass
and
took
two
of
his
young
men
with
him
and
isaac
his
son
and
clave
the
wood
for
the
and
rose
up
and
went
unto
the
place
of
which
god
had
told
him
then
on
the
third
day
abraham
lift
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
place
afar
off
and
abraham
said
unto
his
young
men
abide
ye
here
with
the
ass
and
i
and
the
lad
will
go
yonder
and
worship
and
come
again
to
you
and
abraham
took
the
wood
of
the
and
laid
it
upon
isaac
his
son
and
he
took
the
fire
in
his
hand
and
a
knife
and
they
went
both
of
them
together
and
isaac
spake
unto
abraham
his
father
and
said
my
father
and
he
said
here
am
i
my
son
and
he
said
behold
the
fire
and
the
wood
but
where
is
the
lamb
for
a
and
abraham
said
my
son
god
will
provide
himself
a
lamb
for
a
so
they
went
both
of
them
together
and
they
came
to
the
place
which
god
had
told
him
of
and
abraham
built
an
altar
there
and
laid
the
wood
in
order
and
bound
isaac
his
son
and
laid
him
on
the
altar
upon
the
wood
and
abraham
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
took
the
knife
to
slay
his
son
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
called
unto
him
out
of
heaven
and
said
abraham
abraham
and
he
said
here
am
i
and
he
said
lay
not
thine
hand
upon
the
lad
neither
do
thou
any
thing
unto
him
for
now
i
know
that
thou
fearest
god
seeing
thou
hast
not
withheld
thy
son
thine
only
son
from
me
and
abraham
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
behind
him
a
ram
caught
in
a
thicket
by
his
horns
and
abraham
went
and
took
the
ram
and
offered
him
up
for
a
in
the
stead
of
his
son
a
man
who
by
his
enlightened
views
and
the
elevation
of
his
mind
as
well
as
by
his
faithfulness
as
a
follower
of
christ
is
an
honour
to
the
church
which
he
serves
arthur
stanley
dean
of
westminster
explains
and
characterises
in
these
terms
the
biblical
truths
to
which
i
am
referring
there
have
been
he
says
in
almost
all
ancient
forms
of
religion
and
also
in
some
of
more
modern
date
two
strong
tendencies
each
in
itself
springing
from
the
best
and
purest
feelings
of
humanity
yet
each
if
carried
into
the
extremes
suggested
by
passion
or
by
logic
incompatible
with
the
other
and
with
its
own
highest
purpose
one
is
the
craving
to
please
or
to
propitiate
or
to
communicate
with
the
powers
above
us
by
surrendering
some
object
near
and
dear
to
ourselves
this
is
the
source
of
all
sacrifice
the
other
is
the
profound
moral
instinct
that
the
creator
of
the
world
can
not
be
pleased
or
propitiated
or
approached
by
any
other
means
than
a
pure
life
and
good
deeds
on
the
exaggeration
on
the
contact
on
the
collision
of
these
two
tendencies
have
turned
some
of
the
chief
difficulties
of
evangelical
history
the
earliest
of
them
we
are
about
to
witness
in
the
life
of
abraham
the
sacrifice
the
resignation
of
the
will
in
the
father
and
the
son
was
accepted
the
literal
sacrifice
of
the
act
was
repelled
the
great
principle
was
proclaimed
that
mercy
was
better
than
sacrifice
that
the
sacrifice
of
self
is
the
highest
and
holiest
offering
that
god
can
receive
we
have
a
proverb
which
tells
us
that
man
extremity
is
god
opportunity

abraham
was
upon
the
point
of
accomplishing
an
act
which
even
in
the
presence
of
virtuous
motives
and
a
divine
command
has
been
forbidden
and
is
held
accursed
by
the
subsequent
revelation
and
the
sentiments
of
all
whom
it
has
enlightened
at
this
moment
the
hand
of
abraham
is
stayed
and
patriarchal
religion
is
saved
from
the
antagonism
of
a
conflict
between
the
rigour
of
the
hebrew
law
and
the
merciful
dispensation
of
the
gospel
the
sentiment
which
dean
stanley
expresses
has
my
full
concurrence
but
i
go
still
further
and
maintain
that
there
is
in
the
pathetic
narrative
of
abraham
sacrifice
something
more
than
he
points
out
this
interposition
of
god
in
order
to
arrest
the
very
act
which
he
has
required
is
in
accord
with
the
general
doctrine
of
the
bible
expressly
condemning
human
sacrifices
footnote
but
abraham
as
well
as
several
other
examples
prove
how
such
sacrifices
continued
to
exist
in
the
ferocious
traditions
and
manners
not
only
of
several
nations
of
semitic
origin
but
even
of
the
hebrews
themselves
god
intent
is
to
try
abraham
and
he
pauses
as
soon
as
abraham
obedience
to
the
divine
order
is
beyond
doubt
abraham
does
not
hesitate
to
execute
the
divine
command
he
expresses
no
surprise
at
it
the
sacrifice
of
isaac
is
prepared
and
very
nearly
consummated
as
an
event
almost
of
course
here
we
have
man
in
the
grossest
and
blindest
condition
of
barbarism
in
the
presence
of
god
in
whom
as
sovereign
he
believes

be

to

to

in

the
following
fundamental
characteristic
of
biblical
history
the

man
although

in

in

i
prefer
seeking
for
proofs
in
support
of
my
conviction
in
a
comparison
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
in
the
light
which
christianity
sheds
upon
the
hebrew
revelation
which
it
does
not
contradict

to
which
it
applies
a
movement
of
progress
i
say
progress
progress
immense
infinitely
grander
than
imagination
could
ever
have
conceived

at
the

time
the
character
of
the
divine
work
remaining
absolutely
the
same
it
is
no
longer
as
in
the
old

the
stormy
combat
the
continuous
struggle
of
god
and
of
man
in
the
events
of
the
world
and
in
the
life
of
the
people
god
no
longer
interposes
in
the

testament
to
warn
or
direct
to
raise
up
or
humble
to
recompense
or
to
punish
man
in
this

decides
no

the

still
god
god
in
jesus
christ
with
all
his
sublimity

and
he
only
occupies

fills
the
place
he
appears
there
under
a
different
aspect
in
his
human
form
he
is
weakness
itself
intended
and
destined
to
become
the
very
type
of
humility

of
suffering
the
voluntary
victim
who
expiates

in
the

his
miseries
it

as
he
was

in
all
the
splendour

his
power

own

of
this

throughout

it
he
manifests
it
unceasingly
by
actions
and
by
words
sometimes
by
natural
effects
sometimes
by
miracles
and
yet
how
different
what
a
range
in
the
object
and
the
bearing
of
his
actions
and
of
his
words
in
the
old
testament
the
scene
concentrates
itself
upon
a
corner
of
the
world
a
single
people
a
petty
nation
separated
by
god
from
the
rest
of
the
world
in
order
to
withdraw
it
from
the
contagion
of
idolatry
but
now
it
is
for
the
whole

as

that
the
god
of
the

manifests
himself
and
speaks
it
is
over
the
whole
of
humanity
that
he
spreads
his
light
and
orders
his
servants
to
extend

does
more
much
more
that
divine
light
which
jesus
comes
to
spread
over
the
whole
world
although
it
continues
to
emanate
from
the
same
fountain
becomes
more
complete
and
more
pure
jesus
is
the
first
to
recognise
the
fact
that
the
ancient
law
although
issuing
from
god
bears
here
and
there
traces
of
human
errors
and
passions
i
am
not
come
says
he
to
abolish
the
law
but
to
fulfil
it
how
fulfil
it
by
removing
the
errors
with
which
it
had
become
intermixed
owing
to
the
imperfect
nature
of
the
men
of
the
time
and
of
the
place
at
which
it
appeared
and
by
filling
up
the
gaps
which
that
imperfection
had
entailed
he
disentangles
the
ancient
law
from
every
human
element
and
brings
it
back
to
its
one
divine
element
its
one
pure

perfect
source

have
the
domain
of
the
mind
of
man
left
to
itself
and
to
itself
alone
they
are
the
fruits
assiduously
cultivated
and
slowly
acquired
by
the
laborious
exertions
of
the
human
intellect
during
a
succession
of
ages
if
then
you
meet
in
scriptural
texts
not
treating
of
acts
declared
miraculous
terms
and
assertions
apparently
repugnant
to
facts
recognised
as
truths
in
these
different
sciences
feel
no
disquietude
it
is
not
there
that
god
has
set
up
his
divine
torch
it
is
not
there
that
god
has
spoken
the
language
is
the
language
of
the
men
of
the
different
epochs
men
who
speak
according
to
the
measure
of
their
knowledge
or
of
their
ignorance
the
language
which
they
are
obliged
to
speak
in
order
to
be
understood
by
their
contemporaries
i
feel
surprised
that
men
should
require
to
be
told
this
so
simple
so
clear
is
it
in
matters
of
religion
and
of
morality
there
have
always
existed
and
in
every
place
there
have
existed
spontaneous
instincts
aspirations
and
ideas
common
to
all
men
which
lead
them
to
employ
a
similar
language
a
language
comprehended
and
received
by
all
who
hear
it
whatever
in
other
respects
may
be
their
inequality
in
attainments
and
civilization
whereas
in
matters
purely
scientific
we
find
nothing
at
all
like
this
men
in
the
mass
see
and
speak
of
these
not
as
they
are
to
the
eye
of
science
but
according
to
their
appearances
and
so
men
comprehend
or
do
not
comprehend
them
hear
them
or
do
not
hear
them
according
to
the
degree
of
scientific
knowledge
or
of
ignorance
prevalent
at
the
time
and
place
at
which
they
live
what
would
the
hebrews
in
the
desert
or
the
jews
about
the
person
of
christ
or
the
savages
of
the
pacific
have
said
to
his
missionaries
if
they
had
been
told
that
it
is
the
earth
which
turns
round
the
sun
that
its
shape
is
that
of
a
spheroid
that
it
is
habitable
and
inhabited
at
opposite
points
of
its
circumference
what
is
more
natural
what
more
inevitable
than
that
the
language
of
the
scriptures
should
agree
with
the
scientific
imperfection
of
men
upon
all
these
matters
even
where
that
language
is
full
of
divine
inspiration
as
to
the
religious
or
moral
law
of
humanity
no
one
honours
science
more
than
i
do
no
one
feels
a
greater
admiration
for
it
it
is
a
mission
that
man
has
to
perform
and
it
is
one
of
his
glories
but
it
has
no
place
in
the
relation
of
man
with
god
and
in
the
action
of
god
upon
man
god
is
no
sublime
no
mighty
doctor
who
reveals
truths
of
science
to
man
to
give
him
the
noble
pleasure
of
contemplating
them
or
of
publishing
them
he
has
left
such
researches
to
labours
purely
human
the
work
of
god
is
more
complex
and
grander
it
is
essentially
practical
that
of
which
man
every
man
stands
in
need
that
after
which
he
thirsts
that
which
all
mankind
asks
of
god
simple
as
well
as
learned
is
to
be
enlightened
as
to
the
religious
and
moral
truths
which
are
to
regulate
his
soul
and
his
life
and
to
decide
his
lot
in
eternity
it
is
to
all
mankind
that
god
responds
it
is
to
the
salvation
of
all
men
that
the
scripture
applies
itself
a
celebrated
philosopher
a
man
of
a
mind
lofty
and
sincere

one
of
the
most
lost
of
the
great
lost

the
human
intelligence

to

philosophical
souls
who
even
from
the
moment
when
their
life
in
this
world
ceases

in
god
are
consequently
exempt
from
death
for
death
deprives
them
only
of
that
which
is
of
no
value
but
those
dim
and
feeble
souls
upon
which
reason
hardly
gleams
at
all
those
souls
made
up
entirely
so
to
say
of
empty
imaginings
and
passions
perish
almost
entirely
and
death
instead
of
coming
to
them
as
a
simple
accident
penetrates
to
the
very
bottom
of
their
being
the
soul
of
the
sage
on
the
contrary
can
not
be
more
than
barely
troubled
possessing
by
a
sort
of
eternal
necessity
the
consciousness
of
itself
and
of
god
and
of
things
as
they
really
are
it

christian

when
i
use
the
term
christian
ignorance
i
would
not
have
either
the
sense
which
i
attach
to
the
expression
or
the
intention
with
which
i
use
it
misunderstood
i
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
denied
to
man
to
make
any
use
of
his
intelligence
to
exercise
any
right
to
inquire
freely
after
truth
or
after
any
kind
of
truth
is
the
field
which
is
open
to
the
human
mind
limited
in
extent
is
the
mind
itself
of
limited
reach
is
there
a
difference
of
degree
in
human
knowledge
according
as
the
objects
are
different
to
which
it
is
applied
these
are
questions
all
of
them
fundamentally
contained
in
the
words
christian
ignorance
and
of
these
questions
it
is
my
aim
to
offer
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
right
solution
i
am
in
the
presence
of
four
sciences
and
of
six
schools
or
systems
which
have
made
are
making
and
will
always
continue
to
make
much
noise
in
the
world
the
sciences
are
physiology
psychology
ontology
and
theology
the
systems
to
which
these
sciences
have
given
birth
are
materialism
positivism
scepticism
spiritualism
scientific
theology
mystical
theology
i
am
far
from
meaning
to
discuss
here
the
principles
of
these
systems
or
to
attempt
to
determine
their
value
it
would
be
to
undertake
the
task
of
examining
all
philosophy
and
all
philosophies
i
mean
to
touch
only
upon
one
of
the
special
questions
which
furnish
in
our
days
matter
of
debate
between
christianity
and
these
different
schools
it
is
thus
and
thus
only
that
i
can
clearly
establish
the
sense
which
i
attach
to
the
words
christian
ignorance
and
determine
at
the
same
time
their
bearing
and
their
limitation
i
have
and
for
very
simple
reasons
little
to
say
respecting
the
first
three
systems
to
which
i
have
just
referred
materialism
positivism
scepticism
by
its
denial
of
the
distinction
of
the
soul
and
the
body
of
mind
and
matter
materialism
rejects
psychology
and
arrives
as
far
as
ontology
is
concerned
only
at
atheism
or
at
pantheism
of
the
four
great
philosophical
sciences
physiology
is
the
only
one
with
which
materialism
has
any
concern
amongst
positivists
some
the
more
eminent
admit
it
is
true
the
reality
of
objects
or
to
speak
more
exactly
the
reality
of
the
domain
of
psychology
and
of
ontology
but
in
admitting
it
they
declare
it
to
be
inaccessible
to
the
human
mind
inaccessible
says
littré
not
null
or
it
is
an
ocean
which
washes
our
shore
and
for
which
we
have
neither
bark
nor
sail

strange
to
those
three

for
it
to
be
necessary
that
i
should
discuss
with
them
the
source
bearing
and
legitimacy
of
that
which
i
term
christian

it
is
only
with
spiritualists
with
scientific
theologians
and
with
mystic
theologians
that
it
is
possible
to
discuss
this
question
of
christian
ignorance
for
the
three
schools
to
which
they
belong
are
the
only
ones
which
in
the
same
way
as
christianity
itself
does
open
to
the
human
mind
the
domain
of
the
four
sciences
physiology
psychology

and
which
recognise
the
right
of
the
human
mind
there
to
search
after
truth
and
the
possibility
of
its
being
there
discovered
when
i
speak
of
spiritualists
a
preliminary
remark
is
indispensable
christianity
is
as
spiritualistic
not
to
say
more
so
than
spiritualism
itself
it
is
not
then
with
spiritualism
in
general
and
with
all
spiritualists
without
distinction
that
christians
have
to
deal
in
the
question
of
christian
ignorance
as
it
has
in
other
questions
the
discussion
here
lies
between
christianity
and
rationalistic
spiritualism
alone
and
not
only
between
rationalism
and
christian
ignorance
but
also
between
rationalistic
science
and
christian
science
rationalistic
spiritualism
admits
the
reality
of
psychology
of
ontology
and
of
theology
just
as
it
does
that
of
physiology
it
admits
that
these
different
sciences
owe
their
birth
and
development
necessarily
to
the
spectacle
of
the
universe
of
men
and
of
things
and
have
for
their
object
the
solution
of
the
questions
which
this
spectacle
suggests
but
this
great
fact
once
admitted
rationalism
places
in
psychology
and
in
psychology
alone
the
and
the
fulcrum
of
ontology
and
of
theology
it
only
admits
in
these
two
sciences
results
to
which
the
human
mind
attains
by
its
own
unaided
efforts
that
is
to
say
by
way
of
observation
and
of
reasoning
it
recognises
for
human
knowledge
with
respect
to
ontology
and
theology
no
source
other
than
human
reason
christianity
opens
to
ontology
and
theology
a
larger
sphere
and
other
sources
of
knowledge
besides
the
psychological
facts
supplied
to
these
two
sciences
by
observation
and
reasoning
it
recognises
historical
facts
as
truths
not
only
which
they
are
bound
themselves
to
admit
but
which
they
have
a
right
to
demand
that
others
shall
admit
christianity
does
not
make
the
human
mind
the
sole
object
of
its
belief
it
believes
also
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
finds
in
that
history
facts
to
the
truth
of
which
centuries
and
the
traditions
of
centuries
have
testified
which
it
therefore
holds

is

to
hold
as
well
proved

as
certain

i
am
here
met
by

fundamental
objection
made

authority
they
are

to
make

back

is
substantially
governed

thus

in

of
all
the
efforts

is
in
ultimate
analysis
nothing
more
than
atheism
the
systematic
opponents
of

must
submit
to
this
consequence
most
of
them
i

certain
are
far
from
being
disposed
to
accept
it

would
indeed
repudiate
it
with
the
most
honourable
perseverance
vain
efforts
driven

practical
consequences
of

a

would
soon
make
themselves
evident
in

condition
of
humanity
there
is
a
second
necessity
to
which
the
systematic
opponents
of
the
supernatural
must
make
up
their
minds
they
must
affirm
that
the
laws
proclaimed
by
them
as
general
laws
laws
immanent
and
permanent
in
what
they
call
nature
are
in
effect
the
essential
laws
of
all
nature
of
the
entire
universe
and
of
all
the
beings
whose
seeds
are
there
sown
they
would
have
no
right
to
reject
absolutely
facts
as
supernatural
if
they
were
not
supernatural
of
necessity
and
everywhere
if
in
short
they
were
anywhere
in
harmony
with
laws
of

other
than
the
laws

this
hardly
perceptible
corner
of
nature
which
is
the
residence
of
man

the

of

who
will
venture
to
affirm
that
they
can
not
be
changed
or
suspended
even
there
where
they
reign
is
human
science
ready
to
maintain
that
the
laws
which
she
discovers
from
her
infinitely
small
observatory
are
in

place

flight
of

marches
with

their

to
reach
us
whereas
the

of
our
own

reaches
us
in
a
few
minutes
i
am
not

touched
by
the
labours
and
the
discoveries
of
the
great
modern
physiologists
who
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
bichat
observe
and
note
even
in
their
minutest
and
most
obscure
details
the
different
phenomena
which
life
in
the
midst
of

presents

when
i
have
rendered
homage
to
these
triumphs
of
human
science
i
compare
them
with
the
reality
of
things
with
this
universe
infinitely
great
and
infinitely
minute
which
man
makes
his
study
and
i
can
not
prevent
the
reflection
that
the
universe
contains
infinitely
more
objects
than
man
mind
attains
to
and
infinitely
more
secrets
than
it
discovers

dare
to
affirm
that

beyond
which
no
more

what
physiologist
what
naturalist
will
affirm
that
all
those
worlds
have
living
inhabitants
and
that
if
so
those
inhabitants
must
have
the
same
form
and
be
subject
to
the
same
conditions
and
laws
as
govern
the
inhabitants
of
this
globe
our
science
becomes
very
modest
when
set
side
by
side
with
our
ignorance
even
in
the
matters
appropriate
to
science
and
however
extensive
and
various
the
conquests
of
the
human
mind
may
be
the
universe
is
infinitely
vaster
and
more
varied
than
is
either
the
genius
or
the
strength
of
its
vain
conqueror
knowing
this
and
without
ceasing
to
admire
the
works
of
human
science
christian
ignorance
bows
humbly
before
that
work
of
god
which
outstrips
and
surpasses
immeasurably
every
attainment
of
man
thus
on
two
sides
and
by
two
different
processes
christianity
has
a
higher
point
of
view
and
penetrates
further
into
the
reality
of
things
than
rationalistic
spiritualism
on
the
one
side
by
allowing
its
place
to
historic
facts
which
are
the
life
of
mankind
as
well
as
to
psychological
facts
which
are
the
life
of
man
soul
christianity
gives
to
christian
science
a
deeper
a
broader
foundation
than
rationalistic
science
supplies
on
the
other
side
christianity
admits
both
with
greater
grandeur
and
with
more
modesty
than
rationalism
the
unfathomable
immensity
of
the
universe
as
well
as
the
infinite
diversity
of
its
possible
laws
and
by
the
avowal
of
a
christian
ignorance
it
places
itself
at
least
at
the
most
elevated
point
to
view
the
spectacle
of
which
human
science
can
not
traverse
or
measure
the
extent
it
is
in
the
presence
of
another
rival
i
do
not
say
of
another
adversary
that
i
have
now
to
set
christian
ignorance
i
begin
by
asking
learned
theologians
to
forgive
the
freedom
of
my
thoughts
and
of
my
speech
i
feel
for
them
a
sincere
sentiment
of
respect
let
me
say
brotherly
respect
for
in
the
question
to
which
i
address
myself
i
am
now
to
deal
with
christians
but
actuated
by
the
same
feeling
as
that
which
influenced
me
when
i
was
before
speaking
of
the
relation
of
the
sacred
writings
to
human
science
i
must
declare
my
profound
conviction
that
the
subject
which
is
here
being
treated
is
of
pressing
interest
to
christian
religion
in
the
great
struggle
in
which
it
is
engaged
the
christian
religion
is
founded
upon
facts
upon
an
uninterrupted
series
of
facts
recorded
in
documents
which
exist
whether
the
authenticity
or
the
authority
of
any
part
of
these
documents
the
reality
or
even
the
possibility
of
any
of
the
facts
which
they
contain
is
admitted
or
contested
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
christianity
is
not
as
greek
paganism
was
a
poetical
mythology
attributed
to
fabulous
times
as
the
religion
of
zoroaster
was
a
personification
of
the
great
forces
and
of
the
great
phenomena
of
nature
or
as
the
writings
of
confucius
were
a
collection
of
philosophical
meditations
and
of
moral
precepts
and
counsels
for
the
use
of
wise
and
simple
of
princes
and
subjects
i
am
far
from
contesting
that
poetry
and
philosophy
human
imagination
and
human
meditation
have
their
share
in
the
books
which
form
the
documents
of
christianity
it
is
at
the
same
time
incontestable
however
that
the
peculiar
and
essential
characteristic
of
christianity
from
its
very
origin
down
to
its
latest
development
is
that
it
is
historical
we
behold
the
christian
religion
starting
to
life
living
traversing
centuries
growing
great
and
independent
just
as
we
behold
civil
society
doing
in
a
series
of
facts
which
succeed
to
one
another
and
are
different
from
one
another
christianity
is
not
merely
a
religious
doctrine
it
is
the
history
of
the
events
wherein
have
been
manifested
the
relations
of
god
to
man
and
the
action
of
god
upon
the
destinies
of
mankind
in
proportion
to
the
vigour
with
which
these
events
have
developed
and
spread
themselves
the
human
mind
has
been
exposed
to
two
temptations
which
constitute
at
once
its
honour
and
its
peril
the
temptation
of
explanation
and
that
of
controversy
what
an
undertaking
to
explain
god
his
relation
to
man
the
means
and
the
process
of
his
action
upon
man
even
when
he
essays
to
study
and
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
god
in
whom
he
believes
man
vision
is
troubled
by
the
dazzling
light
his
thought
exhausts
itself
loses
itself
in
the
vain
effort
to
attain
by
means
of
comparisons
and
figures
of
all
kinds
to
the
divine
person
he
conceives
that
person
he
affirms
that
person
he
contemplates
that
person
and
yet
that
person
he
can
not
know
can
not
explain
the
nearer
he
feels
himself
to
god
the
more
does
man
cast
his
eyes
down
the
more
lowly
does
he
incline
himself
to
adore
where
he
can
not
pretend
to
observe
even
the
very
presence
of
god
does
not
aid
man
in
attaining
to
the
science
of
god
what
then
the
result
where
he
would
seek
closely
to
follow
the
agency
of
god
in
the
facts
in
which
he
only
sees
him
imperfectly
where
he
attempts
to
carry
the
torch
of
human
science
into
the
depths
of
the
secrets
of
divine
action
i
here
enter
into
the
domain
which
christianity
ignores
two
examples
will
fully
suffice
i
hope
to
make
my
meaning
clear
the
divinity
of
jesus
god
incarnation
in
jesus
jesus
god
and
man
these
are
the
truths
admitted
proclaimed
incessantly
repeated
in
different
forms
by
the
gospels
and
the
primitive
documents
of
christianity
i
have
already
said
footnote
that
it
is
the
fact
itself
of
the
incarnation
which
constitutes
the
christian
faith
and
which
rises
above
all
definitions
and
all
theological
controversies
to
disregard
this
fact
to
deny
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
is
to
deny
to
overthrow
the
christian
religion
which
would
never
have
been
what
it
is
and
would
never
have
accomplished
what
it
has
but
that
the
divine
incarnation
was
its
principle
and
jesus
christ
god
and
man
its
author

have
not
confined
themselves
to
the

of

have

to

mode

of

in

in
the

had
here
essayed
to
construct
a

of
religion
and
of

history
the

the
acts
of
the

and
the
epistles
as
unanimously
and
persistently
as
they
have
proclaimed

contain
and
proclaim
another
great
truth
of
christianity
the
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
and
their
combined
action
upon
the
human
soul
the
trinity
is
written
in
the
new
testament
where
it
takes
its
place
in
the
history
and
in
the
faith
of
christ
from
their
very
beginning
here
again
men
have
refused
to
restrict
themselves
to
history
or
to
a
belief
in
history
they
have
essayed
to
determine
the
elements
and
to
explain
the
quomodo
of
the
religions
truth
in
other
words
to
transform
history
into
science
hence
all
the
controversies
all
the
contests
all
the
authoritative
decisions
which
have
pretended
to
fix
the
nature
rank
and
relations
of
the
three
divine
persons
or
the
manner
of
the
one
god
existence
and
action
in
the

i

into
none
of
these
controversies
i
examine
none
of
the
doctrines
and
decisions
which
those
controversies
have
either
originated
or
disputed
i
now
only
seek
to
determine
their
essential
character
it
is
the
transition
from
divine
truth
to
human
science
it
is
theology
the
offspring
more
or
less
legitimate
of
religion
when
i
say
its
offspring
more
or
less
legitimate
and
speak
of
theological
science
in
these
guarded
terms
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
design
to
say
openly
all
that
i
think
upon
the
subject
the
scientific
theology
of
christianity
commands
often
my
admiration
always
my
respect
in
their
effort
to
explain
the
grand
facts
of
the
old
and
new
testament
its
writers
have
addressed
themselves
to
a
glorious
task
they
have
in
pursuing
it
fallen
upon
and
thrown
light
upon
sublime
truths
they
have
engaged
for
the
cause
of
christianity
in
formidable
contests
they
have
lent
a
moral
influence
often
pregnant
of
effect
to
the
institutions
and
authorised
teachers
of
christ
religion
but
their
efforts
have
been
even
more
ambitious
than
energetic
more
compromising
than
efficacious
they
have
even
with
the
words
unceasingly
in
their
mouths
shown
an
ignorance
of
the
limits
of
human
science
the
christian
religion
is
a
miracle
the
miraculous
work
of
god
this
was
the
point
from
which
they
started
their
fundamental
datum
forgetting
what
they
have
so
affirmed
they
have
sought
and
they
have
thought
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
the
divine
truth
by
explaining
it
they
have
obscured
and
changed
it
by
an
intermixture
of
man
work
man
can
recognise
as
realities
the
facts
which
are
at
the
same
time
both
christian
dogmas
and
christian
mysteries
man
can
recognise
his
own
subjection
to
them
but
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
make
of
them
a
science
bossuet
also
essayed
to
fathom
the
trinity
in
the
midst
of
his
explanations
and
of
his
comparisons
he
stops
short
and
exclaims
i
do
not
know
who
can
vaunt
that
he
understands
that
perfectly
or
who
can
satisfy
himself
as
to
what
the
modes
of
being
can
add
to
being
or
as
to
whence
arises
their
distinction
in
the
unity
and
the
identity
which
they
have
with
the

itself

this

thus
after
this
final
effort
of
his
genius
it
was
in
christian

that
the
last

take

is
not

that

attempts
of
scientific

painfully
shows

serious
danger
pride

pride
of
the
science
which
dares
to
believe
that
it
has
penetrated
the
secrets
of

scientific
theology
has
had
the
greatest

its
doctors
have
had
to
defend
not

their

their

their

and
this
simultaneously
those
whose

were
the
most
logical
have
generally
been
the
most
tyrannical

in
this
respect
fully
confirms
what
independently
of

might
fairly
be
presumed
namely
that
supposing
the

christian
ignorance
is
far
more
naturally
and
readily
inclined
to
moderation
and
charity
than
theological
science

it
is
not

the
scientific
theologians
whose
ambition
and
efforts
have
led
them
to
mount
beyond
the
sphere
of
human

others
there
are
who
fall
in
a
different
manner
into
the

error
and
the

peril
the
mystic
theologians
ask
for
light
as
to
the
relations
of
god
to
man
not
from
dialectics
and
reasoning
but
from
sentiment
and
inspiration
they
admit
between
god
and
man
a
direct
and
mysterious
communication
which
in
certain
cases
and
upon
certain
conditions
conveys
to
the
human
being
divine
revelations
of
a
character
personal
and
individual
with

approach
the
questions

concern

awarded
by

themselves
that
they

which
the
solution

what
more

and
trembling
curiosity
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
of
our

destiny
whoever
believes
really
in
god
can
not
fail
to
believe
himself
under
the
eye
and
in
the
power
of
god
how
indeed
would
it
be
possible
for
him
to
admit
that
his
creator
is
indifferent
and
powerless
there
are
it
may
be
added
very
few
who
at
certain
moments
and
under
certain
circumstances
have
not
felt
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
their
being
a
stirring
an
impulsion
not
proceeding
from
themselves
nor
from
the
world
around
them
inexplicable
to
them
except
as
proceeding
from
a
superior
source
and
power
who
of
us
has
not
in
the
course
of
his
life
been
sometimes
aware
of
a
design
foreign
to
his
own
volition
his
own
forecast
conducting
him
to
an
end
which
he
did
not
forecast
and
finally
in
the
infinite
number
of
prayers
rising
to
god
from
the
midst
of
human
misery
and
suffering
are
there
not
some
to
which
the
event
brings
satisfaction
just
as
there
are
others
with
respect
to
which
the
contrary
is
the
case
hence
the
problems
of
the
divine
grace
the
divine
providence
the
efficacy
of
prayer
no
doubt
the
desire
is
very
natural
which
passionately
aspires
to
solve
problems
so
grand
and
which
in
the
hope
to
do
so
strives
to
rise
to
a
direct
and
personal
communication
with
their
divine
author
but
the
more
natural
the
desire
the
more
profound
the
error
no
doubt
god
acts
upon
us
upon
our
soul
and
upon
our
destiny
by
his
providence
and
by
his
grace
no
doubt
he
hears
and
listens
to
our
prayers
but
it
is
not
given
to
us
to
foresee
his
action
and
his
answer
nor
to
appreciate
them
in
their
motives
and
their
effects
the
ways
of
god
are
not
our
ways
whether
general
problems
are
submitted
to
man
intelligence
or
questions
touching
him
personally
trouble
his
soul
whether
the
doctors
of
theology
construct
systems
or
the
mystic
theologians
fall
into
ecstasies
we
see
in
all
these
cases
that
man
has
arrived
at
limits
which
oppose
an
effectual
barrier
to
his
scientific
vision
and
which
no
transports
of
piety
will
ever
enable
him
to
overleap
beyond
those
limits
the
condition
imposed
by
god
upon
man
is
confidence
in
spite
of
ignorance
or
in
other
words
christian
ignorance
which
is
gage
at
once
for
his
wisdom
his
charity

liberty
fifth
meditation
christian
faith
forty
years
ago
upon
the
appearance
of
a
work
of
the
abbé
bautain
entitled
the
morality
of
the
gospel
compared
with
the
morality
of
the
philosophers
i
published
in
the
revue
française
an
essay
upon
that
state
of
the
human
soul
which
is
called
faith
upon
the
different
intellectual
facts
which
it
expresses
and
the
different
ways
by
which
man
attains
to
it
although
my
special
subject
at
present
is
no
longer
faith
in
its
abstract
sense
but
of
faith
in
christ
it
is
not
foreign
to
my
purpose
to
lay
before
readers
in
the
year
some
passages
which
appeared
in
my
essay
in
for
notwithstanding
the
imperfection
of
the
essay
referred
to
i
have
not
ceased
to
regard
it
as
founded
on
just
reasoning
it
serves
as
a
for
that
meditation
upon
christian
faith
which
i
now
give
to
the
press
by
the
word
faith
is
commonly
understood
a
certain
belief
in
facts
or
dogmas
of
a
special
nature
in
facts
or
dogmas
of
religion
this
word
indeed
has
only
this
meaning
when
in
speaking
of
the
term
is
used
alone
and
absolutely
this
however
is
neither
its
sole
meaning
nor
its
fundamental
meaning
it
has
a
still
more
extended
sense
from
which
its
religious
sense
is
derived
expressions
like
the
following
are
met
with
i
have
full
in
your
words
this
man
has
in
himself
in
his
strength
in
his
fortune
this
employment
of
the
word
in
secular
matters
so
to
say
occurs
more
frequently
in
the
present
day
it
is
however
no
recent
invention
and
religious
ideas
have
never
been
so
exclusively
its
sphere
that
the
word
faith
has
not
had
also
other
significations
attached
to
it
it
appears
then
by
the
usages
of
common
speech
and
popular
opinion
that
the
word
designates
a
certain
internal
condition
of
the
person
who
believes
and
not
merely
a
certain
species
of
belief
that
it
refers
to
the
nature
itself
of
the
conviction
not
to
its
object
that
this
word
was
nevertheless
in
its
origin
and
still
is
more
generally
applied
to
those
kinds
of
belief
termed
religious
what
then
in
its
special
and
ordinary
application
to
religious
belief
are
the
variations
which
have
taken
place
in
its
meaning
and
which
are
taking
place
every
day
men
engaged
in
teaching
and
preaching
a
religion
a
doctrine
a
religious
reform
sometimes
whilst
appealing
to
the
whole
energy
of
the
human
mind
in
its
state
of
liberty
succeed
in
producing
in
their
disciples
an
entire
profound
and
powerful
conviction
of
the
truth
of
their
teaching
this
conviction
is
called
a
name
which
neither
masters
and
disciples
will
repudiate
nor
even
their
adversaries
disallow
faith
then
is
only
a
profound
and
imperious
conviction
of
the
truth
of
a
dogma
of
religion
it
matters
little
whether
the
conviction
has
been
acquired
by
way
of
reasoning
or
has
been
generated
by
controversy
or
by
free
and
rigorous
examination
that
which
gives
to
it
its
character
and
entitles
it
to
the
name
of
is
its
energy
is
the
empire
which
that
energy
gives
to
it
over
the
whole
man
such
at
every
time
was
the
faith
of
the
great
reformers
and
more
especially
in
the
sixteenth
century
such
the
faith
of
their
most
illustrious
disciples
of
calvin
after
luther
and
knox
after
calvin
the
same
men
have
preached
the
same
doctrine
to
persons
whom
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
convince
by
the
use
of
reasoning
by
an
appeal
to
examination
or
to
science
to
women
and
crowds
of
persons
incapable
alike
of
laborious
study
and
of
lengthened
reflection
they
spoke
to
the
imagination
to
the
moral
affections
where
the
persons
whom
they
addressed
were
prone
to
feel
emotion
and
to
believe
in
consequence
of
emotion
they
gave
the
name
of
to
the
result
of
their
action
just
as
they
had
done
so
to
the
result
of
the
process
essentially
intellectual
of
which
i
was
before
speaking
faith
thus
instilled
was
a
religious
conviction
not
acquired
by
reasoning
and
deriving
its
origin
in
human
sensibility
this
is
the
idea
of
faith
as
entertained
by
the
mystic
sects
appeals
to
human
sensibility
and
human
emotion
have
not
always
sufficed
to
generate
faith
another
spring
of
human
influence
has
been
resorted
to
and
men
have
been
commanded
to
adhere
to
practices
and
to
form
habits
man
must
sooner
or
later
attach
ideas
to
the
acts
which
are
habitual
to
him
and
attribute
a
meaning
to
that
which
produces
in
him
a
constant
effect
the
mind
was
led
to
the
belief
of
the
principles
which
had
given
birth
to
certain
practices
and
habits
a
new
kind
of
faith
appeared
it
had
for
its
principle
and
dominant
characteristic
the
submission
of
the
mind
to
an
authority
invested
with
the
right
at
once
to
govern
man
life
and
to
regulate
his
thought
finally
faith
has
not
everywhere
nor
constantly
been
generated
in
the
human
mind
either
by
the
free
exercise
of
the
intelligence
or
by
appeals
to
sensibility
or
by
the
formation
of
habits
it
was
then
said
that
faith
was
incommunicable
that
it
was
not
in
man
power
to
impart
faith
or
to
acquire
it
by
any
exertion
of
his
own
that
for
this
purpose
god
intervention
and
the
action
of
his
grace
were
necessary
divine
grace
became
thus
the
preliminary
condition
of
faith
and
its
definitive
character
the
word
has
consequently
in
turn
expressed
a
conviction
acquired
by
the
free
efforts
of
the
human
intelligence
a
conviction
acquired
by
way
of
the
sensibility
and
without
the
concurrence
of
the
reason
and
often
even
against
its
authority
a
conviction
acquired
by
long
submission
to
a
power
invested
with
a
power
from
on
high
to
command
conviction
a
conviction
induced
by
supernatural
means
by
divine
grace
what
in
the
midst
of
this
variety
of
sources
from
which
it
may
emanate
is
the
essential
and
invariable
character
of
faith
what
is
the
state
of
the
soul
in
which
faith
reigns
when
we
consider
it
independently
of
its
origin
and
of
its
object
two
kinds
of
belief
exist
in
man
the
one
i
will
not
call
it
innate
for
this
is
an
inexact
and
justly
criticised
expression
but
a
belief
natural
and
spontaneous
which
springs
up
and
establishes
itself
in
the
mind
of
man
if
not
without
his
being
aware
of
it
at
least
without
the
help
of
any
reflection
or
volition
on
his
part
by
the
development
alone
of
his
nature
and
the
influence
of
that
external
world
in
the
midst
of
which
his
life
is
passed
the
other
kind
of
belief
is
the
result
of
laborious
examination
and
reflection
the
fruit
of
voluntary
study
and
of
the
power
possessed
by
man
either
to
concentrate
all
his
faculties
upon
a
certain
object
with
the
design
of
mastering
it
or
to
direct
the
thought
inwards
and
realise
what
is
there
taking
place
to
render
an
account
thereof
to
himself
and
thus
to
acquire
by
an
act
of
volition
and
of
reflection
a
knowledge
which
he
did
not
before
possess
although
the
facts
which
form
its
object
nevertheless
existed
as
facts
external
and
which
he
might
see
by
his
eyes
or
as
facts
which
were
taking
place
within
him
of
these
two
kinds
of
belief
which
merits
the
name
of
it
seems
at
first
sight
that
the
name
is
perfectly
suitable
to
that
kind
of
belief
which
i
have
termed
natural
and
spontaneous
such
belief
is
exempt
from
doubt
and
disquietude
it
directs
man
in
his
judgment
in
his
actions
and
with
an
empire
which
he
dreams
neither
of
eluding
nor
contesting
it
is
ingenuous
unhesitating
practical
sovereign
who
would
not
recognise
in
it
the
characteristics
of
faith
has
in
effect
two
characters
but
it
has
at
the
same
time
others
which
belief
natural
and
spontaneous
has
not
almost
unnoticed
by
the
man
who
is
yet
guided
by
it
this
natural
and
spontaneous
belief
is
to
him
as
it
were
a
law
from
without
which
he
has
received
not
accepted
which
he
obeys
by
instinct
without
having
given
it
any
intimate
and
personal
assent
it
suffices
for
the
exigencies
of
his
life
it
guides
him
admonishes
him
impels
him
or
checks
him
but
without
so
to
say
any
concurrence
on
his
own
part
without
giving
birth
in
him
to
the
sentiment
that
any
active
energetic
or
powerful
principle
is
stirring
within
him
without
procuring
him
the
profound
joy
of
contemplating
loving
adoring
the
truth
which
reigns
over
him
on
the
contrary
has
this
power
faith
is
not
science
neither
is
it
ignorance
the
mind
which
faith
penetrates
has
never
yet
perhaps
rendered
a
true
account
to
itself
of
that
in
which
it
has
faith
and
perhaps
never
will
do
so
but
the
mind
is
nevertheless
certain
of
it
to
the
mind
it
is
present
living
it
is
no
longer
a
general
belief
a
law
of
human
nature
which
governs
the
moral
man
as
the
law
of
gravitation
governs
bodies
it
is
a
personal
conviction
a
truth
which
the
moral
man
has
made
his
own
by
force
of
contemplation
of
voluntary
obedience
and
love
henceforth
this
truth
does
much
more
than
suffice
to
his
life
it
satisfies
his
soul
it
does
much
more
than
direct
him
it
enlightens
him
how
many
for
instance
live
under
the
empire
of
a
natural
and
instinctive
belief
that
moral
good
and
moral
evil
exist
without
our
being
able
to
affirm
that
they
have
in
them
such
belief
is
in
them
as
it
were
a
master
undisputed
to
whom
nevertheless
they
render
no
homage
whom
they
obey
without
seeing
and
without
loving
but
if
a
circumstance
a
cause
however
trivial
revealing
so
to
say
the
conscience
to
itself
should
attract
and
fix
their
attention
upon
this
distinction
between
moral
good
and
evil
which
is
a
spontaneous
law
of
their
nature
should
they
knowingly
acknowledge
and
accept
it
as
their
legitimate
master
should
their
intelligence
honour
itself
by
comprehending
it
and
their
liberty
do
itself
honour
by
obeying
it
should
they
feel
their
soul
as
it
were
the
sanctuary
of
a
sacred
law
as
the
focus
into
which
this
truth
concentrates
and
establishes
itself
in
order
thence
to
diffuse
its
rays
of
light
this
is
no
longer
simple
natural
belief
it
is
faith
then
does
not
exclusively
consist
of
either
of
the
two
kinds
of
belief
which
at
first
sight
seem
to
share
between
them
the
soul
of
man
it
partakes
at
once
of
natural
and
spontaneous
belief
and
of
the
belief
which
is
the
fruit
of
reflection
and
science
yet
it
differs
from
each
like
the
latter
it
is
individual
and
intimate
like
the
former
confidant
active
dominant
considered
in
itself
independently
of
all
comparison
with
any
other
particular
and
analogous
state
of
the
intellect
faith
is
the
full
security
of
man
in
the
possession
of
his
belief
as
absolved
from
effort
as
exempt
from
doubt
the
path
which
the
mind
has
pursued
in
arriving
at
it
is
obliterated
and
a
sentiment
only
is
left
behind
of
the
natural
and
harmony
between
the
mind
of
man
and
the
truth
itself
to
the
man
whose
mind
faith
penetrates
his
intelligence
and
his
volition
present
no
longer
any
problems
for
solution
as
to
the
things
which
are
the
objects
of
his
faith
he
feels
himself
in
full
possession
of
the
truth
to
light
and
to
guide
him
on
his
way
and
in
full
possession
of
himself
to
act
according
to
the
truth
as
faith
has
internal
characteristics
which
are
peculiar
to
it
it
has
also
with
some
strange
and
rare
exceptions
external
conditions
which
are
necessary
to
it
it
is
distinguishable
from
other
modes
of
human
belief
not
only
by
its
nature
but
by
its
object
up
to
a
certain
point
these
conditions
may
be
determined
and
perceived
although
imperfectly
according
to
the
nature
itself
of
that
state
of
the
soul
and
of
its
effects
a
belief
may
be
so
entire
and
sure
of
itself
that
no
further
effort
of
the
intellect
seems
necessary
and
the
believer
wholly
absorbed
in
the
truth
which
in
his
judgment
he
possesses
may
lose
all
memory
of
the
way
by
which
he
arrived
at
it
a
conviction
may
be
so
forcible
as
to
become
master
of
his
every
action
as
well
as
of
every
impulse
of
his
mind
and
may
imperatively
force
and
morally
oblige
him
to
submit
all
things
to
its
empire
a
state
this
of
the
intellect
which
is
the
fruit
perhaps
not
merely
of
the
exercise
of
the
intelligence
but
of
a
strong
emotion
of
a
long
obedience
to
certain
practices
and
in
the
midst
of
which
all
the
three
great
faculties
of
man
the
sensibility
the
intelligence
and
the
will
are
simultaneously
in
activity
and
simultaneously
satisfied
where
all
this
is
the
case
the
occasion
which
has
induced
such
a
situation
of
the
soul
had
need
be
one
worthy
of
the
soul
and
of
its
situation
the
subject
with
which
it
is
so
occupied
had
need
be
one
which
embraces
the
entire
man
which
sets
in
play
all
his
faculties
responding
to
all
the
requirements
of
his
moral
nature
it
has
a
right
in
return
to
all
his
devotedness
the
characteristics
of
ideas
proper
to
become
really
a
faith
would
seem
to
be
intellectual
beauty
and
practical
importance
an
idea
which
should
present
itself
to
the
mind
as
true
without
at
the
same
time
striking
it
by
the
extent
or
the
gravity
of
its
consequences
might
produce
certitude
but
the
name
of
would
not
be
suitably
applied
to
it
nor
would
the
practical
merit
or
the
immediate
utility
of
an
idea
suffice
of
itself
to
generate
faith
to
do
so
it
must
also
attract
it
must
also
take
possession
of
the
human
mind
by
the
pure
beauty
of
truth
in
other
words
in
order
that
a
simple
belief
whether
instinctive
or
arising
from
reflection
may
become
faith
the
thing
believed
must
be
of
a
nature
to
procure
to
man
the
united
joys
of
contemplation
and
of
activity
to
awaken
in
him
the
twofold
sentiment
that
it
is
of
lofty
origin
and
of
potent
influence
his
idea
must
be
such
as
that
he
shall
be
induced
to
regard
it
as
a
medium
between
the
ideal
world
and
the
real
world
as
a
missionary
charged
to
model
the
one
upon
the
other
and
to
unite
them
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
name
of
faith
is
used
almost
exclusively
to
characterise
religious
beliefs
no
other
belief
possesses
in
so
high
a
degree
the
two
characteristics
footnote
which
provoke
the
development
of
faith
footnote
intellectual
beauty
and
practical
importance
many
principles
of
science
are
beautiful
and
fruitful
in
useful
applications
political
theories
may
strike
the
mind
by
the
elevation
of
the
ideas
which
they
embody
and
by
the
grandeur
of
their
results
the
doctrines
of
a
pure
morality
are
still
more
surely
and
more
commonly
invested
with
this
double
power
nor
have
these
kinds
of
belief
failed
sometimes
to
generate
faith
in
the
human
soul
still
to
receive
a
clear
and
profound
impression
at
one
time
of
their
intellectual
beauty
at
another
of
their
practical
importance
a
certain
measure
of
science
and
of
sagacity
or
a
certain
turn
for
public
life
or
for
politics
as
the
case
may
require
is
almost
always
necessary
and
this
does
not
belong
to
all
men
nor
to
every
epoch
religious
belief
on
the
contrary
has
no
need
of
such
resources
it
carries
in
itself
and
in
its
very
nature
infallible
means
of
effect
having
once
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
man
however
limited
and
undeveloped
in
other
respects
his
intelligence
may
be
or
however
rude
and
low
his
condition
it
seems
to
him
a
truth
at
once
sublime
and
usual
a
truth
which
addresses
itself
to
him
as
an
habitant
of
this
earth
and
at
the
same
time
which
opens
to
him
access
to
those
lofty
regions
to
those
treasures
of
intellectual
life
which
without
the
light
of
faith
he
would
have
never
known
it
has
for
him
the
charm
of
the
purest
truth
and
exercises
over
him
the
empire
of
the
most
powerful
interest
can
it
astonish
us
that
the
belief
once
existent
its
transition
to
a
state
of
should
be
so
rapid
and
so
general
but
it
is
precisely
on
account
of
its
instinctive
tendency
to
transform
itself
into
faith
and
into
a
faith
of
extraordinary
energy
that
religious
belief
has
need
to
continue
always
free
and
always
subject
to
the
tests
which
liberty
has
the
right
to
impose
legitimate
faith
that
is
as
we
understand
it
the
faith
which
does
not
deceive
itself
as
to
its
objects
and
which
addresses
itself
really
to
the
truth
is
beyond
contradiction
the
loftiest
condition
to
which
the
human
mind
in
its
present
state
can
attain
for
it
is
that
state
in
which
man
feels
his
moral
nature
fully
satisfied
in
which
he
gives
himself
up
entirely
to
the
mission
prescribed
to
him
by
his
thought
but
a
faith
may
be
illegitimate
it
is
possible
for
this
state
of
the
soul
to
be
produced
by
error
the
chance
of
error
experience
proves
this
at
every
step
is
even
here
greater
the
more
the
different
routes
which
lead
to
faith
are
multiplied
and
the
more
its
effects
are
energetic
man
may
be
led
astray
in
his
faith
by
his
sentiments
by
his
habits
by
the
empire
of
moral
affections
or
of
external
circumstances
as
well
as
by
the
defect
or
the
abuse
of
his
intellectual
faculties
for
his
faith
may
spring
from
any
of
these
various
sources
nevertheless
faith
once
there
it
is
daring
and
ambitious
it
passionately
aspires
to
diffuse
itself
to
usurp
to
reign
and
constitute
itself
the
law
of
opinions
and
facts
not
only
is
faith
ambitious
it
is
strong
it
possesses
it
displays
in
support
of
its
pretensions
and
its
designs
an
energy
an
address
a
perseverance
which
are
almost
always
wanting
to
opinions
simply
scientific
so
that
for
this
mode
and
degree
of
conviction
and
belief
far
more
than
for
any
other
there
is
chance
of
the
individual
falling
into
error
and
of
society
falling
under
oppression
for
these
perils

not

his

a

against

if

consider
this
essay
or
psychological
portrait
shall
i
rather
call

with

i
am
immediately
struck
by
two
features
as
characterising
it
on
the
one
side
the
ideas
and
the
facts
upon
which
christian

is
founded
have
evidently
that
twofold
merit
of
intellectual
beauty
and
of
practical
importance
which
has
both
the
right
and
the
power
to
compel
faith
on
the
other
side
christian
faith
may
originate
in

does
originate
in
sources
the
most
diverse
in
study
and
rational
meditation
in
sentiment
in
authority
in
an
appeal
to
the
divine
grace
what
grander
and
more
impressive
to
the
mind
of
man
than
the
principles
of
christian
faith
regarded
as
a
whole
god
and
man
incessantly
present
the
one
to
the
other
in
the
life
of
each
man
as
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
what
more
grave
and
more
momentous
regarded
from
a
practical
point
of
view
in
the
present
hour
it
is
peace
to
the
soul
of
man
peace
to
his
life
in
the
future
it
is
his
destiny
throughout
eternity
the
diversity
of
the
sources
of
christian
faith
is
not
less
evident
than
its
intellectual
beauty
and
its
practical
importance
beyond
a
doubt
the
christian
faith
of
the
chancellor
de
of
pascal
of
bossuet
of
fénelon
of
luther
of
calvin
of
newton
of
euler
of
chalmers
was
as
much
the
fruit
of
reflection
and
of
learning
was
as
freely
meditated
and
adopted
as
the
scepticism
of
montaigne
and
of
bayle
as
the
sensualism
of
hobbes
and
the
pantheism
of
spinoza
it
is
equally
certain
that
all
christian
communities
roman
catholic
or
protestant
have
had
their
mystics
their
eminent
and
sincere
believers
whose
faith
was
illumed
and
fed
by
sensibility
and
imagination
in
the
former
case
in
the
emotions
and
practices
of
fervent
piety
in
the
latter
in
empassioned
transports
and
strivings
after
a
direct
communication
with
god
and
with
christ
as
for
the
faith
founded
upon
authority
the
church
of
rome
has
presented
the
most
extraordinary
example
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
if
protestantism
has
caused
the
faith
of
individuals
to
make
great
strides
in
the
direction
of
liberty
it
has
nevertheless
taken
for
its
fixed
basis
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
sacred
book
and
has
thus
ensured
a
great
importance
and
very
efficacious
influence
to
the
principle
of
authority
having
thus
placed
christian
faith
in
its
true
point
of
view
and
assigned
to
it
its
just
rank
in
the
history
of
the
human
soul
let
us
see
whence
arises
the
contest
in
which
that
faith
is
engaged
with
natural
religion
and
with
religious
philosophy
what
is
the
principle
of
this
contest
and
what
its
character
here
we
are
met
by
that
question
the
question
which
has
been
agitated
during
nineteen
centuries
and
to
which
all
the
intellect
of
modern
times
has
applied
itself
is
the
christian
faith
in
contradiction
to
human
reason
some
affirm
that
a
contest
between
the
two
is
natural
and
inevitable
of
these
there
are
who
tell
us
that
reason
should
give
way
to
faith
and
again
others
who
say
that
faith
should
yield
to
reason
whereas
on
the
contrary
there
are
those
also
who
deny
that
such
contest
is
inevitable
and
who
maintain
that
faith
and
reason
as
they
ought
to
do
may
both
live
in
peace
with
each
other
in
my
opinion
the
difference
between
christian
faith
and
that
which
is
styled
natural
religion
or
religious
philosophy
is
profound
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
between
the
two
has
been
rightly
put
or
that
the
character
of
their
opposition
has
been
rightly
defined
to
discover
what
in
effect
this
character
is
i
address
myself
first
to
the
philosophers
we
know
how
descartes
began
his
great
philosophical
inquiries
to
what
state
he
brought
his
mind
in
order
to
enter
upon
his
task
i
persuaded
myself
says
he
that
i
could
not
do
better
with
respect
to
the
opinions
which
up
to
that
time
i
had
entertained
than
to
begin
by
ridding
myself
of
them
entirely
in
order
then
either
to
replace
them
by
better
opinions
or
to
return
to
the
old
ones
if
i
should
find
them
on
examination
to
conform
to
the
standard
of
reason
then
proceeding
to
determine
the
precepts
to
be
followed
by
him
in
this
recasting
of
all
his
opinions
by
such
standard
my
first
principle
said
he
was
never
to
accept
anything
as
true
unless
i
could
evidently
recognise
its
truth
in
other
words
to
avoid
carefully
any
precipitate
judgment
to
allow
my
mind
to
follow
no
bias
and
not
to
comprise
anything
in
its
judgments
but
what
presented
itself
so
clearly
and
so
distinctly
to
my
mind
as
to
leave
me
no
room
for
doubt

more
than
a
century
after
descartes
condillac
wishing
to
trace
to
its
source
the
origin
of
human
knowledge
and
to
write
the
history
of
its
progressive
development
did
far
more
than
obliterate
from
his
mind
its
primitive
ideas
he
began
his
labours
by
curtailing
the
human
mind
of
a
great
part
of
its
proper
proportions
he
reduced
man
to
the
primitive
condition
of
a
statue
leaving
to
it
no
other
faculty
than
the
sensation
and
then
he
fancied
he
could
derive
from
sensations
all
man
ideas
all
his
knowledge
in
fact
the
entire
man
himself
thus
these
two
great
systems
spiritualism
and
sensualism
have
their
very
commencement
each
in
an
arbitrary
assumption
descartes
effacing
from
the
human
mind
all
that
it
has
learnt
to
know
or
to
believe
solely
by
its
spontaneous
activity
and
by
the
natural
course
of
human
life
has
treated
the
mind
as
a
and
to
fill
up
the
void
which
he
has
so
made
he
does
not
admit
anything
there
unless
it
presents
itself
so
clearly
and
so
distinctly
to
his
mind
as
to
leave
him
no
room
to
doubt
respecting
it
condillac
on
the
other
hand
suppresses
not
only
all
that
which
man
has
learnt
spontaneously
and
without
reflection
but
the
man
himself
leaving
in
the
place
of
man
a
statue
sentient
it
is
true
but
only
sentient
and
with
this
statue
and
his
sensations
alone
he
undertakes
to
reconstruct
the
man
the
entire
man
with
all
the
developments
of
his
nature
and
of
his
thought
i
see
nothing
in
either
of
these
processes
more
than
a
starting
point
entirely
fictitious
a
false
step
made
at
the
very
commencement
of
philosophy
in
short
a
mere
hypothesis
descartes
rendered
admirable
services
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
of
intellectual
sincerity
condillac
contributed
to
the
progress
of
the
method
which
i
shall
call
the
method
of
anatomy
and
scientific
dissection
applied
both
to
the
human
mind
and
to
the
material
world
but
from
their
very
commencement
both
these
philosophers
threw
themselves
out
of
the
high
road
the
straight
road
of
philosophy
each
from
the
very
commencement
substituted
a
mere
hypothesis
in
the
place
of
an
exact
and
complete
appreciation
of
facts
it
is
far
from
my
intention
to
discuss
either
of
these
two
systems
i
am
content
to
put
aside
the
two
hypotheses
the
of
descartes
and
the
statue
of
condillac
and
i
proceed
my
way
lighted
by
the
facts
as
they
are
naturally
produced
in
the
history
of
the
mind
of
man
to
inquire
what
is
the
cause
and
what
the
import
of
the
struggle
which
is
taking
place
between
rationalistic
religious
philosophy
and
christian
faith
the
true
point
of
departure
of
this
history
and
the
first
of
the
facts
which
show
themselves
there
is
the
of
man
and
the
universe
spectator
and
spectacle
the
one
confronting
the
other
the
and
the
the
subject
and
the
object
in
the
language
of
philosophy
i
hasten
to
say
that
i
repudiate
absolutely
the
different
systems
pantheism
whether
materialistic
or
idealistic
scepticism
whether
idealistic
or
absolute
which
refuse
to
admit
this
primary
fact
deny
the
reality
of
the
external
world
or
the
legitimacy
of
the
knowledge
of
it
which
the
understanding
acquires
see
only
illusions
in
the
relations
of
man
to
the
universe
or
absorb
man
and
the
universe
together
in
the
confusion
and
the
obscure
darkness
of
a
pretended
identity
i
do
not
dream
of
here
discussing
these
different
systems
if
i
engaged
in
such
discussion
i
should
have
to
deal
with
something
very
different
from
the
question
to
which
i
am
applying
myself
at
this
moment
here
i
have
only
to
do
with
rationalistic
spiritualism
this
form
of
spiritualism
has
so
much
in
common
with
christianity
that
it
admits
the
reality
and
the
distinction
of
the
and
of
the
of
the
subject
and
the
object
of
the
spectator
and
the
spectacle
of
spirit
and
matter
of
man
and
the
universe
for
rationalistic
spiritualists
as
well
as
for
christians
this
is
the
great
fact
in
the
midst
of
which
and
under
the
empire
of
which
man
intelligence
is
developed
life
passed
man
is
there
passive
active
and
witness
all
simultaneously
as
spectator
he
receives
impressions
from
the
spectacle
which
both
prompt
him
to
act
and
which
stir
his
being
from
within
he
is
witness
both
to
what
is
passing
within
himself
and
to
what
is
passing
without
himself
notwithstanding
the
diversity
and
the
mobility
of
the
impressions
which
he
receives
from
without
and
of
the
acts
which
he
originates
himself
he
has
a
consciousness
of
his
own
personal
and
permanent
existence
and
also
the
consciousness
of
existences
other
than
his
own
he
knows
not
by
the
way
of
reasoning
or
hypothesis
but
by
instinctive
and
immediate
intuition
that
which
although
it
is
not
himself
yet
acts
upon
himself
as
something
coming
from
himself
man
discovers
the
external
world
as
he
becomes
aware
of
himself
by
the
intercommunication
which
takes
place
between
them
and
which
nevertheless
shows
him
how
distinct
from
himself
is
that
external
world
he
observes
and
notes
both
what
takes
place
without
him
and
within
him
the
results
of
this
observation
he
terms
facts
nor
are
they
for
him
vain
appearances
creations
merely
of
his
thought
or
volition
they
are
manifestations
to
him
of
realities
independent
of
himself
and
yet
to
which
he
stands
in
relation
they
are
bonds
of
union
in
which
he
feels
that
he
is
highly
interested
not
merely
as
any
curious
spectator
might
be
but
as
a
real
being
interested
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
science
but
interested
as
one
whose
very
destiny
is
therein
involved
amongst
these
facts
in
their
nature
so
numerous
and
so
diverse
i
only
select
those
which
concern
the
religious
instincts
of
man
or
the
questions
which
they
suggest
i
admit
two
kinds
of
these
first
the
spontaneous
and
common
religious
beliefs
which
mankind
professes
although
under
very
different
forms
and
in
very
different
degrees
secondly
the
theories
and
systems
of
philosophy
emanating
from
and
promulgated
by
philosophers
in
order
to
bring
under
discussion
the
popular
religious
opinions
and
to
resolve
the
questions
which
they
involve
on
the
one
side
is
the
natural
and
instinctive
religion
of
humanity
on
the
other
is
human
science
which
when
it
addresses
itself
to
the
task
of
disengaging
natural
religion
from
every
system
of
mythology
is
called
religious
philosophy
are
there
in
the
nature
and
in
the
religious
history
of
men
no
other
great
facts
besides
these
instincts
of
humanity
and
these
systems
of
human
science
natural
religion
with
its
mythologies
and
religious
philosophy
with
its
systems
are
these
all
the
religious
aid
accorded
to
man
to
enlighten
him
upon
subjects
of
religion
to
the
question
thus
formalised
rationalistic
spiritualism
says
yes
whereas
christian
faith
replies
no
in
addition
to
the
facts
to
which
i
have
just
referred
the
instinctive
beliefs
of
mankind
and
the
systemised
doctrines
of
human
science
concerning
religion
the
christian
faith
admits
and
proclaims
another
great
religious
fact
the
real
and
active
presence
of
god
in
the
life
of
man
and
in
the
history
of
humanity
what
the
christian
faith
affirms
is
that
the
real
and
active
presence
of
god
in
man
life
amidst
the
mysteries
of
providence
of
prayer
and
of
grace
and
the
real
and
active

in
the
history
of
the
human
race
amidst
the
mysteries
of
revelation
of
inspiration
of
the
incarnation
and
of
the
redemption
do
not
constitute
simply
a
poetical
mythology
are
not
merely
hypotheses
of
philosophy
but
are
psychological
and
historic
facts
which
human
science
can
not
explain
but
which
it
nevertheless
can
nay
is
bound
to
recognise
not
philosophers
only
but
the
whole
human
race
believers
and
disbelievers
are
placed
in
the
same
permanent
position
in
which
all
originally
stood
that
is
to
say
man
stands
always
confronting
the
universe
man
always
at
once
spectator
and
actor
greedy
to
know
and
comprehend
the
spectacle
on
which
he
is
looking
and
of
which
he
himself
forms
part
the
spectacle
is
immense
infinite
the
spectator
petty
imperfect
ephemeral
diverse
and
with
limited
powers
of

accordingly
as
he
is
situated
accordingly
as

disposed

his

reaches
he
sees

greater

less
distance

with
a
vision
more

accurate
all
that
the
spectacle
presents
he
observes
more

completely
more

exactly
the
facts
which
are
occurring
there
hence
the
differences
of
opinion
amongst
mankind
who
are
they
amongst
them
who
succeed
best
in
appreciating
and
in
describing
these
facts
without
altering
their
character
or
omitting
any
this
is
the
fundamental
question
the
question
antecedent
to
and
which
governs
all
the
others
the
contest
then
between
christians
and
is
not
a
contest
between
faith
and
reason
reason
occupies
a
place
and
a
large
place
in
the
faith
of
christians
they
attain
to
faith
as
well
by
reason
as
by
sentiment
or
authority
nor
is
there
at
the
same
time
in
the
negations
or
the
doubts
of
as
much
reflection
and
as
much
accurate
observation
as
they
themselves
suppose
are
christians
right
in
affirming
not
only
the
existence
of
god
but
his
real
and
active
presence
in
the
life
of
man
and
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
are
these
psychological
and
historic
facts
which
reason
and
science
are
bound
to
admit
or
are
the
deists
who
are
not
christians
justified
in
denying
these
facts
and
in
limiting
god
to
existence
alone
and
in
treating
him
as
subject
to
the
general
and
permanent
laws
assigned
to
all
other
existences
as
far
as
christianity
and
rationalistic
spiritualism
are
concerned
this
is

real
question
at
issue
having
pointed
out

source
of

of

indicate

evince

right

of

and
the
rational
consequences
of

these
spiritualists
deceive
themselves
they
do
not
attain
to
god
himself
they
only
attain
to
the
idea
of
god
what
they
establish
is
the
admissibility
of
the
intellectual
idea
not
the
presence
of
a
real
being
in
rejecting
the
psychological
and
historical
facts
upon
which
christianity
is
founded
that
is
to
say
the
relations
free
and
unintermitted
of
god
with
man
whether
in
the
individual
life
of
each
man
or
in
the
history
of
the
mankind
rationalistic
spiritualism
deprives
itself
of
direct
and
positive
evidence
to
prove
god
existence
it
places
a
human
argument
in
the
place
of
the
divine
manifestation
and
a
scientific
work
of
man
in
the
place
of
the
real
action
of

in
an
excellent
book
justly
entitled
by
him
idea
of
god
another
contemporary
philosopher
caro
has
valiantly
and
with
brilliant
success
defended
this
idea
against
the
different
systems
which
reject
or
distort
it
and
not
limiting
himself
to
polemics
he
has
concluded
his
work
by
a
forcible
and
clear
enunciation
of
his
own
thought
it
is
the
living
god
the
intelligent
god
whom
we
defend
against
the
god
of
naturalism
who
would
not
be
more
than
a
law
of
geometry
or
a
blind
force
against
the
god
of
hegel
who
would
not
be
more
than
an
indeterminate
being
an
origin
and
a
commencement
of
things
or
an
absolute
mind
result
at
once
and
product
of
the
world
against
the
god
of
the
new
idealists
who
to
save
his
divinity
strip
him
of
his
reality
we
affirm
in
opposition
to
all
these
subtle
and
hazardous
conceptions
that
a
supposed
perfect
being
unless
he
had
an
existence
would
not
be
perfect
that
a
mere
ideal
of
the
mind
is
not
a
god
that
if
he
is
not
a
substance
he
is
but
a
conception
a
pure
category
of
spirit
a
creation
and
dependence
upon
man
thought
which
in
ceasing
to
exist
annihilates
its
god
that
if
he
is
not
cause
he
is
the
most
useless
of
beings
and
if
he
is
cause
he
is
mind
supreme
for
were
he
not
so
he
would
be
nothing
but
an
unconscious
and
necessary
agent
a
blind
spring
of
the
world
inferior
to
what
he
produces
since
in
the
organic
matter
that
emanates
from
him
an
intelligence
displays
itself
of
which
he
would
possess
nothing
and
since
too
in
man
is
manifested
a
divine
reason
another
remark
and
we
have
done
with
our
definition
this
living
god
this
god
intelligent
is
also
a
god
that
loves
a
god
that
loved
not
would
not
be
worthy
of
being
adored
we
do
not
adore
a
law
however
simple
it
may
be
however
fruitful
in
consequence
we
do
not
adore
a
force
if
it
be
blind
however
potent
however
universal
it
may
be
nor
an
ideal
however
pure
it
may
be
if
it
be
only
an
abstraction
we
only
adore
a
being
who
is
living
perfection
the
perfection
of
reality
in
its
highest
forms
of
mind
and
love
every
other
adoration
implies
a
contradiction
if
the
object
is
a
pure
abstraction
idolatry
if
the
object
be
the
substance
of
the
universe
or
humanity
this
is
god
as
he
appears
to
reason
and
as
the
religious
conscience
of
humanity
will
have
him
this
is
your
god

it

caro
has
not
carried
his

still
higher

rationalistic

the
spectacle
of

of
man
in

causes
to

at

stops

there
because
it

it

every

philosophers
pride
themselves
upon

upon

the
neglect

every

consideration
they
are
right
in
one
sense
for
the
knowledge
of

of
truth
as
it
is
in
itself
is
that
which
the
human
mind
proposes
to
itself
as
its
object
and
is
the
only
thing
which
can
satisfy
it
if
man
pretends
to
it
it
is
his
right
and
his
honour
to
do
so
whatever
the
object
of
his
study
the
mind
does
not
halt
or
rest
until
it
believes
that
it
has
attained
to
the
truth
this
is
no
privilege
of
philosophers
neither
are
they
the
only
ones
for
whom
truth
is
a
law
all
men
have
a
right
to
live
under
its
empire
whether
as
to
facts
or
ideas
no
one
not
even
those
who
affect
most
disdain
for
theory
would
venture
to
lay
down
the
principle
that
we
should
be
indifferent
whether
we
are
essentially
in
the
right
and
that
practically
there
is
no
difference
between
truth
and
error
but
by
what
signs
is
truth
recognisable
are
there
no
other
than
the
affirmations
of
that
inquisitive
spectator
named
the
human
mind
is
it
only
by
language
by
reasoning
and
by
discussion
that
the
truth
of
an
idea
and
of
a
doctrine
manifests
and
proves
itself
to
such
a
pretension
if
advanced
i
hesitate
not
to
reply
with
a
denial
and
in
doing
so
to
repeat
what
i
have
just
said
every
doctrine
religious
moral
or
political
has
to
submit
to
a
test
the
practical
application
the
idea
transformed
into
reality
the
thought
made
the
life
these
are
the
most
certain
signs
of
an
idea
being
intrinsically
true
these
too
are
proofs
of
its
reasonable
legitimacy
which
it
is
bound
to
give
there
is
a
radical
difference
between
the
material
world
and
the
intellectual
world
the
laws
which
regulate
and
maintain
order
in
the
material
world
are
independent
of
man
of
both
his
thought
and
his
volition
it
matters
not
that
he
knows
these
laws
or
is
ignorant
of
them
they
do
not
the
less
exist
and
govern
man
has
no
power
to
change
arrest
or
suspend
their
operation
he
can
not
influence
them
galileo

it

galileo
as

been
ignorant

the

the
contest
between
the

was

perfectly
indifferent

of

man
error
is
absolutely
without

or

in
the
intellectual

it
is
otherwise
here
man
is

spectator
he
is
an
actor
an
actor
free
or
not
to
act
to
act
with

he
thinks
and
he
wills
and
so
contributes
to
the
facts
which
take
place
in
the
world
he
knows
or
is
ignorant
of
the
laws
he
respects
or
violates
the
laws
which
preside
here

which
do
not
preside
here
as

external
to

faults

severer

no

these

christianity
has
now
been
subjected
to
this
test
for
nineteen
centuries
it
is
subject
to
it
at
this
moment
it
will
continue
ever
to
be
so
i
need
not
say
that
i
do
not
propose
to
retrace
here
the
narrative
of
the
manner
in
which
it
has
supported
and
surmounted
that
test
that
would
be
to
write
the
history
of
christianity
i
confine
myself
on
the
contrary
to
a
single
small
part
of
this
history
the
most
modest
part
the
least
pretending
and
shall
endeavour
to
bare
a
little
to
the
view
what
christianity
when
it
has
been
put
into
practice
what
christian
faith
after
it
has
become
christian
life
has
in
the
different
situations
of
man
life
accomplished
and
is
every
day
accomplishing
for
the
ennoblement
of
his
nature
and
the
furtherance
of
his
ultimate
destiny
three
words
of
inscribed
upon
the
banners
of
the
french
revolution
constituted
its
force
the
rights
of
man
as
man
rights
by
this
title
alone
by
virtue
alone
of
his
humanity
three
other
words
equality
have
served
as
a
commentary
upon
the
three
former
it
is
in
the
name
of
these
two
maxims
that
the
french
revolution
is
making
the
tour
of
the
world
they
are
the
sources
of
the
good
and
the
evil
the
movements
in
advance
as
well
as
the
ruinous
calamities
of
our
time
and
of
an
unknown
future
whilst
all
of
true
and
good
that
these
two
maxims
contain
is
christian
and
was
proclaimed
by
christianity
all
that
they
have
of
false
and
fatal
is
condemned
and
expressly
repudiated
by
christianity
not
only
in
this
terrible
confusion
does
christianity
proclaim
in
principle
the
part
that
is
good
and
condemn
in
principle
the
part
that
is
evil
but
christianity
alone
in
point
of
fact
has
the
necessary
authority
and
moral
force
to
suppress
the
evil
without
at
the
same
time
causing
the
good
also
to
perish
it
is
a
subject
to
us
in
these
days
of
pride
and
of
a
pride
that
is
just
that
we
have
at
last
begun
to
consider
man
himself
the
individual
man
his
existence
and
his
personal
liberty
his
rights
and
the
guarantees
of
his
rights
as
the
essential
objects
of
social
institutions
we
have
at
last
emerged
from
the
rut
of
pagan
antiquity
glorious
at
once
and
rude
where
the
individual
made
wholly
subordinate
was
sacrificed
to
the
state
where
man
was
regarded
simply
as
citizen
and
thousands
of
human
creatures
were
degraded
and
treated
as
cyphers
in
favour
of
a
single
class
men
are
no
longer
numbered
as
jews
and
gentiles
romans
and
barbarians
freemen
and
slaves
christianity
first
not
only
proclaimed
but
put
into
practice
this
important
truth
the
right
of
every
man
as
man
the
worth
of
the
human
soul
and
of
the
human
person
irrespectively
of
his
situation
in
life
constitute
the
the
fundamental
idea
the
dominant
precept
of
the
christian
religion
it
was
in
effect
in
religious
society
in
the
rising
christian
church
that
this
principle
was
first
proclaimed
and
first
put
into
practice
christianity
treated
the
relation
of
man
to
god
as
the
chief
concern
of
man
life
and
religious
liberty
as
the
chief
of
human
liberties
it
was
in
the
presence
of
god
that
christians
admitted
the
equal
importance
of
every
soul
as
it
was
amongst
christians
themselves
that
they
greeted
each
other
as
brethren
and
that
fraternity
engendered
charity
but
although
sprung
from
a
source
so
elevated
and
applied
at
first
upon
a
stage
so
small
the
christian
idea
was
not
on
that
account
less
potent
or
less
fruitful
in
spite
of
obstacles
and
reverses
it
maintained
itself
and
diffused
itself
through
centuries
and
over
distant
countries
it
made
constant
efforts
to
penetrate
civil
society
at
the
epochs
of
the
history
of
christendom
which
are
most
to
be
deplored
in
the
midst
of
the
oppressions
and
the
iniquities
which
have
brought
desolation
upon
it
daring
voices
have
never
been
wanting
at
one
time
it
was
the
voice
of
the
christian
church
itself
directed
against
the
masters
of
the
earth
at
another
a
voice
issuing
from
the
bosom
of
the
church
itself
full
of
generous
protestations
against
the
disorders
and
acts
of
violence
which
were
taking
place
in
its
own
bosom
jesus
god
and
man
having
raised
man
before
god
man
never
afterwards
entirely
humiliated
and
degraded
himself
before
any
human
tyranny
in
the
presence
of
the
greatest
inequalities
of
earthly
power
the
appellation
never
ceased
to
be
echoed
in
christian
society
and
even
at
this
day
after
all
the
progress
which
equality
has
made
in
civil
society
it
is
only
in
religious
societies
and
in
christian
churches
that
men
hear
themselves
greeted
as
the
christian
faith
has
not
only
exercised
a
political
influence
in
the
state
by
changing
the
relations
in
which
individuals
stand
to
the
political
authorities
or
in
which
the
different
classes
stand
to
one
another
it
has
also
introduced
a
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
primary
natural
and
imperishable
association
called
family
there
also
it
has
caused
to
disappear
at
one
time
the
despotism
of
husband
and
father
at
another
the
degradation
of
wife
and
the
brutal
or
licentious
independence
of
children
if
we
give
ourselves
the
trouble
to
compare
the
christian
family
as
religion
laws
and
morals
have
made
it
with
the
family
of
antiquity
which
was
most
strongly
constituted
namely
the
roman
family
we
shall
not
need
to
examine
long
before
we
discern
clearly
on
which
side
order
really
is
on
which
side
the
just
appreciation
of
natural
sentiments
the
respect
for
right
and
liberty
i
have
said
that
at
the
same
time
that
christianity
proclaims
and
puts
in
practice
all
that
is
true
and
healthy
in
the
popular
maxims
of
our
times
man
rights
and
liberty
his
equality
and
fraternity
it
condemns
and
rejects
all
that
they
contain
of
false
and
deplorable
there
is
one
very
striking
fact
in
the
history
of
the
foundation
of
christianity
a
fact
traceable
not
merely
in
the
records
of
a
few
years
but
through
three
centuries
christianity
began
with
resisting
absolute
power
and
with
laying
claim
to
liberty
of
conscience
it
owed
its
establishment
to
the
same
cause
in
the
roman
world
no
one
any
longer
made
even
a
show
of
resistance
every
kind
of
oppression
was
in
force
every
claim
to
freedom
abandoned
the
christians
again
raised
high
the
banner
of
right
and
of
resistance
in
the
name
of
right
but
never
did
they
raise
their
banner
to
encourage
revolt
or
attacks
upon
authority
they
undertook
the
defence
of
liberty
against
tyranny
and
never
made
appeals
to
insurrection
against
authority
martyrdom
not
murder
such
is
the
sum
of
the
history
of
christianity
from
the
day
of
its
birth
in
the
manger
of
jesus
to
the
day

it
mounted
the
throne
of
constantine
the
reason
of
this
is
that
from
the
time
when
christianity
was
yet
in
its
cradle
and
even
afterwards
when
it
was
struggling
to
conquer
its
liberty
liberty
was
not
an
exclusive
idea
for
christians
either
in
their
doctrines
or
their
lives
they
recognised
respected
and
proclaimed
with
equal
solicitude
both
principles
upon
which
the
moral
order
of
the
world
reposes
authority
and
liberty
they
never
in
any
respect
sacrificed
the
one
to
the
other
nor
humiliated
the
one
in
the
presence
of
the
other
masters
and
disciples
all
referred
power
to
its
true
source
and
did
homage
to
its
right
at
the
same
time
that
they
maintained
their
own
right
against
power
when
jesus
spoke
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
for
he
taught
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as

the
development
in
them
of
human
intelligence

their
career
was
short

these
two
brilliant

did
not

in

agitate

christianity
has
proved
infinitely
healthier
and
more
sound
she
has
made
herself
an
incessant
subject
of
study

has
shifted

place

to

herself
she
has
before
her
over
the

a
future
immense
and
full
of
promise
this
she
owes
to
her
origin
she
was
born
in
the
manger
of
jesus
there
is
at
present
a
disposition
amongst
earnest
and
enlightened
men
to
recognise
it
is
true
the
services
which
christianity
has
rendered
to
the
world
but
to
attribute
them
only
to
the
morality
of
christianity
they
laud
to
the
sky
the
moral
character
of
jesus
and
his
moral
precepts
but
they
repudiate
nay
deplore
the
dogmas
with
which
in
the
christian
faith
christian
morality
is
combined
and
incorporated
they
demand
that
the
morality
be
separated
from
it
and
be
presented
to
man
without
anything
but
its
intellectual
beauty
and
practical
excellence
although
not
disputing
that
there
is
somewhat
of
human
in
the
origin
and
empire
of
morality
i
have
established
in
this
volume
of
meditations
that
it
is
necessarily
allied
to
religious
belief
and
that
when
separated
from
its
divine
source
and
viewed
apart
from
that
which
gives
it
sanction
it
is
incomplete
illogical
and
powerless
a
branch
without
root
and
without
fruit
i
go
farther
now
and
express
my
meaning
fully
not
only
is
christian
morality
intimately
connected
with
christian
faith
as
the
christian
faith
is
itself
connected
with
christian
dogmas
but
christian
morals
christian
faith
and
christian
dogmas
have
taken
their
origin
and
derived
their
force
at
a
source
still
higher
and
in
an
authority
still
more
decisive
christianity
did
not
begin
it
did
not
rise
upon
the
world
as
one
body
of
doctrines
or
code
of
precepts
from
its
first
step
it
was
a
truth
strange
to
the
ordinary
course
of
human
affairs
and
superior
to
them
a
fact
divine
and
an
act
divine
it
was
as
such
and
by
its
character
as
such
that
sometimes
all
at
once
and
sometimes
gradually
it
struck
men
as
by
a
blow
and
vanquished
them
at
first
the
rude
and
simple
then
the
great
and
learned
publicans
and
emperors
the
disciples
of
plato
and
the
fishermen
of
the
sea
of
gennesareth
at
different
moments
and
for
different
motives
all
of
them
saw
in
the
cradle
and
the
rapid
extent
of
infant
christianity
a
sublime
and
superhuman
fact
a
god
present
and
acting
in
and
by
jesus
some
recognised
and
adored
him
at
the
very
moment
of
his
appearing
others
observed
him
with
troubled
and
angry
feelings
but
in
proportion
as
the
truth
developed
itself
even
those
who
detested
him
doubted
if
they
were
right
in
doubting
the
council
and
all
the
senate
of
the
children
of
israel
had
caused
peter
and
the
other
apostles
to
be
placed
in
prison
and
took
counsel
to
have
them
put
to
death
then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
council
a
pharisee
named
gamaliel
a
doctor
of
the
law
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
people
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
space
and
said
unto
them
ye
men
of
israel
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
men
for
before

rose
up
theudas
boasting
himself
to
be
somebody
to
whom
a
number
of
men
about
four
hundred
joined
themselves
who
was
slain
and
all
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
scattered

brought
to

this

rose
up
judas
of
galilee
in

days
of

drew
away
much
people
after
him
he
also
perished
and
all
even
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
dispersed
and
now
i
say
unto
you
refrain
from
these
men
and
let
them
alone
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
men
it
will
come
to
nought

if

can

anonymous
author
has
expressed
in
a
very
short
preface
his
intention
in
writing
this
volume
as
well
as
its
fundamental
ideas
those
who
feel
says
he
dissatisfied
with
the
current
conceptions
of
christ
if
they
can
not
rest
content
without
a
definite
opinion
may
find
it
necessary
to
do
what
to
persons
not
so
dissatisfied
it
seems
audacious
and
perilous
to
do
they
may
be
obliged
to
reconsider
the
whole
subject
from
the
beginning
and
placing
themselves
in
imagination
at
the
time
when
he
whom
we
call
christ
bore
no
such
name
but
was
simply
as
luke
describes
him
a
young
man
of
promise
popular
with
those
who
knew
him
and
appearing
to
enjoy
the
divine
favour
to
trace
his
biography
from
point
to
point
and
accept
those
conclusions
about
him
not
which
church
doctors
or
even
apostles
have
sealed
with
their
authority
but
which
the
facts
themselves
critically
weighed
appear
to
warrant
this
is
what
the
present
writer
undertook
to
do
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
own
mind
and
because
after
reading
a
good
many
books
on
christ
he
felt
still
constrained
to
confess
that
there
was
no
historical
character
whose
motives
objects
and
feelings
remained
so
incomprehensible
to
him
the
inquiry
which
proved
serviceable
to
himself
may
chance
to
be
useful
to
others
what
is
now
published
is
a
fragment
no
theological
questions
whatever
are
here
discussed
christ
as
the
creator
of
modern
theology
and
religion
will
make
the
subject
of
another
volume
which
however
the
author
does
not
hope
to
publish
for
some
time
to
come
in
the
meanwhile
he
has
endeavoured
to
furnish
an
answer
to
the
question
was
christ
object
in
founding
the
society
which
is
called
by
his
name
and
how
is
it
adapted
to
attain
that
object
on
merely
considering
even
after
a
first
perusal
the
brief
words
which
i
have
here
extracted
it
is
i
think
impossible
not
to
perceive
how
much
there
is
that
is
artificial
and
embarrassed
i
had
almost
said
how
much
there
is
that
is
false
not
only
in
the
position
in
which
the
author
has
placed
himself
at
the
very
outset
but
in
the
special
intentions
which
he
avows
to
study
the
life
and
the
aim
of
the
life
of
christ
without
considering
him
as
the
creator
of
modern
theology
and
religion
to
defer
all
examination
and
conclusion
upon
this
last
subject
to
aspire
to
know
the
person
and
the
mind
of
christ
after
thus
separating
him
from
his
work
to
inquire
what
he
meant
to
accomplish
when
living
without
considering
what
he
in
effect
accomplished
in
the
ages
which
followed
his
passage
through
the
world
to
treat
him
in
short
and
to
examine
him
as
we
should
treat
and
examine
a
person
unknown
to
us
a
fossil
man
so
to
say
of
which
the
features
might
be
traceable
in
some
contemporary
document
showing
that
he
once
existed
but
who
has
left
no
other
trace
to
supply
us
with
argument
or
proof
of
what
he
intended
or
what
he
performed
this
undoubtedly
is
a
strange
manner
of
proceeding
one
which
holds
out
very
little
chance
of
an
accurate
and
true
comprehension
of
the
immense
fact
called
christianity
thus
mutilated
in
its
very
cradle
christianity
of
which
the
writer
limits
himself
to
a
bare
search
after
the
germ
in
the
nascent
thought
of
its
owner
whereas
it
might
have
been
observed
and
its
nature
verified
in
its
positive
and
vast
development
this
is
a
species
of
decomposition
of
which
the
great
facts
of
history
and
morality
do
not
admit
we
are
not
here
like
anatomists
describing
the
autopsy
of
a
corpse
to
know
and
comprehend
such
facts
really
we
must
study
them
in
their
different
elements
and
in
all
the
development
of
their
life
they
form
a
drama
in
which
we
are
actors
not
a
manuscript
which
we
are
deciphering
i
can
easily
understand
how
the
anonymous
writer
of
the
ecce
homo
came
to
conceive
the
idea
of
his
book
and
to
confine
it
within
the
limits
which
he
has
himself
assigned
i
can
also
understand
his
motives
like
all
his
contemporaries
he
is
placed
and
lives
in
presence
of
the
grave
questions
agitated
in
these
days
respecting
christianity
and
its
author
what
was
christ
a
man
or
very
god
or
god
and
man
at
once
how
did
the
divine
nature
and
the
human
nature
manifest
themselves
in
him
did
he
really
effect
the
miracles
assigned
to
him
can
there
be
such
things
as
miracles
what
are
we
to
understand
by
the
supernatural
is
god
a
real
being
personal
and
free
existing
and
accomplishing
his
works
in
a
region
beyond
that
which
we
style
nature
christianity
and
the
life
of
its
founder
inevitably
suggest
all
these
questions
which
in
our
days
occupy
and
violently
agitate
men
minds
the
anonymous
author
of
the
ecce
homo
did
not
wish
to
enter
upon
them
nay
it
was
his
aim
to
study
and
comprehend
christ
without
touching
them
at
all
is
it
because
upon
these
grave
problems
he
entertains
himself
no
positive
and
decided
opinions
or
because
he
wished
to
a
certain
extent
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
state
of
opinion
of
some
of
his
contemporaries
and
to
treat
christ
as
those
speak
of
him
who
only
see
in
him
a
man
who
regard
christianity
as
a
fact
not
supernatural
owing
its
origin
like
other
natural
facts
to
the
sole
and
proper
force
of
mankind
upon
this
i
can
form
no
opinion
i
neither
know
the
anonymous
author
of
the
ecce
homo
nor
the
motives
which
actuate
him
what
is
certain
is
that
he
is
quite
right
in
entitling
his
book
ecce
homo
for
it
is
only
the
man
christ
that
he
has
proposed
to
study
and
it
is
by
studying
the
man
christ
that
he
has
proposed
to
explain
christianity
i
do
not
know
if
after
having
written
his
book
he
was
aware
of
the
result
to
which
it
leads
but
the
result
is
in
effect
a
strange
one
it
is
condemnatory
and
destructive
of
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
book
it
demonstrates
by
a
sincere
and
honest
although
an
incomplete
and
superficial
study
of
the
facts
the
impossibility
of
explaining
either
christ
by
the
human
nature
alone
or
the
christian
religion
by
any
merely
natural
operations
of
humanity
the
work
is
divided
into
two
parts
and
contains
altogether
chapters
the
first
part
is
devoted
to
the
study
of
christ
personally
his
peculiar
character
his
manner
of
dealing
with
men
the
mission
which
he
proposed
to
himself
to
accomplish
the
nature
of
the
society
which
he
sought
to
found
and
the
authority
which
he
counted
upon
exercising
in
the
second
part
the
christian
society
itself
its
points
of
resemblance
to
the
systems
of
philosophy
and
its
points
of
difference
therefrom
its
fundamental
principles
and
positive
laws
and
the
habits
and
sentiments
which
are
developed
by
those
laws
all
become
in
turn
the
objects
of
the
author
observations
and
descriptions
observations
often
profound
descriptions
often
exact
and
striking
although
somewhat
minute
and
lengthy
everywhere
however
there
breathes
forth
a
sentiment
unquestionably
moral
and
full
of
the
gentlest
sympathy
for
humanity
all
this
gives
to
the
work
a
real
attractiveness
in
spite
of
the
vagueness
of
the
ideas
which
reign
there
and
in
spite
of
the
perceptible
incertitude
of
the
author
conclusions
upon
the
solemn
questions
which
he
approaches
but
upon
which
he
does
not
enter
i
have
no
intention
of
saying
more
i
have
not
to
render
an
account
in
detail
of
this
book
or
to
discuss
any
of
the
opinions
or
assertions
upon
which
i
may
not
agree
with
him
my
aim
is
only
to
determine
the
character
of
his
work
and
to
show
plainly
first
its
tendency
and
then
its
insufficiency
there
precisely
is
his
originality
in
setting
out
and
dealing
with
the
subject
of
the
purely
human
nature
both
of
christ
and
of
christianity
he
seems
not
far
from
participating
the
opinions
of
rationalistic
criticism
but
the
more
he
advances
the
farther
he
departs
from
the
goal
at
which
the
rationalists
arrive
he
appears
predisposed
in
their
favour
the
process
of
his
thought
seems
often
to
conform
to
theirs
his
conclusions
are
not
clearly
contrary
but
in
effect
under
the
empire
either
of
his
instincts
or
under
the
influence
of
his
historical
and
moral
studies
he
is
more
christian
than
he
appears
perhaps
even
more
so
than
he
believes
himself
to
be
and
if
the
firm
doctrines
of
christianity
find
in
him
no
sure
and
declared
defender
neither
do
they
encounter
in
him
the
consistent
hostility
of
a
severe
logician
or
the
indifferentism
of
a
mere
sceptic
there
are
several
passages
of
this
remarkable
work
which
are
particularly
distinguished
by
these
characteristics
to
these
i
feel
pleasure
in
referring
the
reader
they
are
in
both
parts
of
the
book
that
is
to
say
in
the
first
part
chapter
fifth
entitled
and
chapter
ninth
footnote
entitled
on
the
nature
of
society
in
the
second
part
chapter
tenth
entitled
legislation
compared
with
philosophic
and
chapter
the
eleventh
christian
footnote
a
perusal
of
these
passages
will
if
i
do
not
deceive
myself
fully
justify
the
impression
which
the
work
has
made
upon
me
and
satisfy
the
reader
that
i
am
right
in
what
i
have
said
of
the
author
inconsistency
with
respect
to
religion

without
expressly
referring
to
any
other
passages
i
simply
remark
that
there
are
in
this
book
ideas
expressed
and
particular
assertions
made
which
suggest
numerous
questions
and
call
for
many
observations
i
find
in
the
entire
volume
a
singular
mixture
of
plain
and
practical
common
sense
with
a
subtlety
sometimes
tinctured
with
piety
and
sometimes
with
philosophy
there
reigns
in
it
upon
the
nature
of
man
and
of
human
societies
an
intellectual
elevation
both
moral
and
religious
which
embarrasses
and
obscures
itself
in
a
long
and
painful
process
of
refinements
it
bears
the
impress
of
a
grandeur
of
thought
and
of
sentiment
without
presenting
them
however
in
a
form
sufficiently
simple
and
vivid
but
i
have
no
idea
of
examining
or
discussing
here
in
detail
this
remarkable
work
my
aim
is
only
to
make
the
result
clear
to
the
reader
to
which
i
have
already
referred
and
indeed
it
appears
incontestable
the
author
aim
has
been
to
study
and
portray
the
human
part
of
christ
the
human
part
of
his
doctrine
as
well
as
of
his
life
he
has
declared
this
to
be
his
aim
by
entitling
his
book
ecce
homo
and
by
saying
that
he
deferred
to
another
volume
every
theological
question
every
study
of
christ
as
the
creator
of
theology
and
of
modern
religion
he
has
already
done
much
more
than
he
is
aware
the
striking
inference
from
his
first
volume
being
that
there
was
in
christ
much
more
than
man
and
that
if
he
had
been
but
man
however
superior
we
may
picture
his
nature
to
be
to
that
of
ordinary
humanity
the
work
of
christianity
such
as
it
in
fact
was
and
is
would
have
been
to
him
a
thing
not
only
which
he
could
not
have
accomplished
but
which
he
could
not
even
have
conceived
the
end
