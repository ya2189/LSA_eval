a

paris
upon
the
whole
the
institution
if
wisely
conducted
is
capable
of
bearing
fruit
and
ought
to
do
so
and
the
laboring
population
of
paris
should
be
grateful
to
the
municipal
council
for
the
six
million
francs
that
our
ediles
have
so
generously
voted
for
making
this
interesting
work
a
success
on
seeing
the
precautions
perhaps
necessary
that
the
laborer
now
takes
against
the
capitalist
we
can
not
help
instituting
a
comparison
with
the
antique
and
solid
organization
of
labor
that
formerly
governed
the
trades
unions
each
corporation
possessed
a
syndic
charged
with
watching
over
the
management
of
affairs
and
over
the
receipts
and
the
use
of
the
common
resources
these
syndics
were
appointed
for
two
years
and
had
to
make
annually
at
least
four
visits
to
all
the
masters
in
order
to
learn
how
the
laborers
were
treated
and
paid
and
how
loyally
the
regulations
of
the
corporation
were
observed
they
rendered
an
account
of
this
to
the
first
assembly
of
the
community
and
cited
all
the
masters
in
fault
evidently
the
new
labor
exchange
will
not
cause
a
revival
of
these
old
ways
of
doing
things
which
perhaps
may
have
had
something
of
good
in
them
but
we
may
hope
that
laborers
will
find
in
it
protection
against
those
who
would
require
of
them
an
excess
of
work
as
well
as
against
those
who
would
preach
idleness

revolt

a

by

the
controlling
motive
and

purpose
of
the

newspaper
are
financial
profit
one
is
now
and
then
founded
and
conducted
even
at
a
loss
to
serve
party
social
religious
or
other
ends
but
where
the
primary
intent
is
unselfish
there
remains
hope
for
monetary
gain
the
first
newspapers
never
dreamed
of
teaching
or
influencing
men
but
were
made
to
collect
news
and
entertainment
and
deal
in
them
as
in
any
other
commodity
but
because
this
was
the
work
of
intelligence
upon
intelligence
and
because
of
conditions
inherent
in
this
kind
of
business
it
soon
took
higher
form
and
service
and
came
into
responsibilities
of
which
in
its
origin
it
had
taken
no
thought
wingate
views
and

gives
the
opinions
of
the
leading
editors
and
publishers
of
fifteen
years
ago
upon
this
point
of
newspaper
motive
and
work
the
first
notable
utterance
was
by
whitelaw
reid
who
said
the
idea
and
object
of
the
modern
daily
newspaper
are
to
collect
and
give
news
with
the
promptest
and
best
elucidation
and
discussion
thereof
that
is
the
selling
of
these
in
the
open
market
primarily
a
merchant
of
news
substantially
and
distinctly
the

ideas

the

is
fat
with
discussion
by
these
and
other
eminent
newspaper
men
as
to
the
motives
methods
and
ethics
of
their
profession
disclosing
high
ideals
and
genuine
seeking
of
good
for
all
the
world
but
the
whole
of
it
at
last
rests
upon
primary
motives
and
controlling
principles
in
nowise
different
or
better
or
worse
than
those
of

so
that
taking
publications
in
the
lump
it
is
neither
untrue
nor
ungenerous
nor
when
fully
considered
is
it
surprising
to
say
that
the
doing
fact
and
fancy
are
collected
reported
discussed
scandalized
condemned

and
turned
back
upon
the

as

merchandise
the
force
and
reach
of
this
controlling
motive
elude
the
reckoning
of
the
closest
observation
and
ripest
experience
but
as
somewhat
measuring
its
strength
and
pervasiveness
hear
and
for
a
moment
think
of
these
facts
and
figures
the
american
newspaper
directory
for
accepted
as
the
standard
compiler
and
analyst
of
newspaper
statistics
gives
as
the
number
of
regularly
issued
publications
in
the
united
states
and
territories
then
when
we
know
that
these
have
an
aggregate
circulation
for
each
separate
issue
not
for
each
week
or
month
or
for
a
year
but
for
each
separate
issue
of
each
individual
publication
a
total
of
copies
many
of
them
repeating
themselves
each
day
some
each
alternate
day
some
each
third
day
and
the
remainder
each
week
month
or
quarter
and
that
in
a
single
year
they
produce
copies
knowing
though
dimly
realizing
this
tremendous
output
we
have
some
faint
impression
of
the
numerical
strength
of
this
mighty
force
which
holds
close
relation
to
and
bears
strong
influence
upon
life
thought
and
work
and
which
measured
by
its
units
is
as
the
june
leaves
on

trees

its
vast
aggregate
almost
inconceivable

never
i
am
to
speak
to
you
of
the
business
end
of
the
american
newspaper
that
is
of
the
work
of
the
publisher
department
not
the
editor
at
the
outset
i
am
confronted
with
divisions
and
subdivisions
of
the
subject
so
many
and
so
far
reaching
that
right
regard
for
time
compels
the
merest
generalization
but
as
best
i
can
and
as
briefly
as
i
can
i
shall
speak
upon
the
topic
under
three
general
divisions
the
personal
and
material
forces
which
make
the
newspaper
the
sources
of
revenue
from
the
joint
working
of
these
forces
the
direct
office
bearing
and
influence
of
these
forces
it
is
but
natural
that
the
general
public
has
limited
idea
of
the
personality
and
mechanism
of
the
publication
business
for
much
of
its
movement
is
at
night
and
there
is
separation
and
isolation
of
departments
as
well
as
complicated
relation
of
the
several
parts
to
the
whole
not
many
years
ago
a
very
few
men
and
boys
could
edit
print
and
distribute
the
most
important
of
newspapers
where
now
hundreds
are
necessary
parts
in
a
tremendous
complexity
but
even
of
the
nearly
publications
in
the
united
states
more
than
are
of
that
class
which
in
all
their
departments
are
operated
by
from
two
to
four
or
five
persons
and
which
furnish
scant
remuneration
even
for
these
among
the
thin
populations
and
in
the
remote
regions
are
thousands
of
weekly
papers
and
you
may
spell
the
weekly
either
with
a
double
or
an
where
there
are
two
men
and
a
boy
one
of
whom
does
a
little
writing
and
much
scissoring
loafing
among
the
corner
groceries
and
worse
begging
for
subscribers
for
advertisements
and
occasionally
and
indiscriminatingly
thrashing
or
being
thrashed
by
the
esteemed
contemporary
or
the
outraged
citizen
the
second
of
whom
sets
the
type
reads
the
proofs
corrects
them
more
or
less
makes
the
rollers
works
the
old
hand
press
and
curses
the
editor
and
the
boy
impartially
and
the
third
of
whom
sweeps
the
office
weekly
or
monthly
inks
the
forms
and
sometimes
pis
them
carries
the
papers
and
does
generally
the
humble
and
diversified
works
of
the
devil
while
between
the
three
the
whole
thing
periodically
goes
to
the
level
pretty
sure
to
be
reached
now
and
then
by
papers
of
this
class
yet
there
are
many
of
these
country
papers

are
useful

the
linotype
machine
for
all
its
typesetting
except
the
displayed
advertisements
and
other
papers
are
using
it
for
a
portion
of
their
work
while
still
others
are
using
the
rogers
and
various
machines
of
which
there
are
already
six
or
more
it
seems
probable
that
within
the
early
future
newspaper
composition
will
very
generally
be
done
by
machinery
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
many
of
my
hearers
this
evening
know
little
or
nothing
of
the
processes
of
the
printer
art
and
that
some
exposition
of
it
may
interest
a
considerable
portion
of
this
audience
the
vast
number
of
these
little
messengers
of
thought
which
are
required
in
a
single
modern
daily
newspaper
is
little
known
to
newspaper
readers
set
in
the
manner
of
ordinary
reading
a
column
of
the
new
york
contains
pieces
counting
head
lines
leads
and
so
on
while
if
set
solidly
in
its
type
there
are
pieces
in
one
column
or
about
in
a
page
or
about
in
one
of
its
ordinary
issues
a
sunday
issue
of
the
new
york
contains
nearly
if
not
quite
distinct
types
and
other
pieces
of
metal
each
of
which
must
be
separately
handled
between
thumb
and
finger
twice
once
put
into
the
case
and
once
taken
out
of
it
each
issue
of
the
paper
no
one
inexperienced
in
this
delicate
work
has
the
slightest
conception
of
the
intensity
of
attention
fixity
of
eye
deftness
of
touch
readiness
of
intelligence
exhaustion
of
vitality
and
destruction
of
brain
and
nerve
which
enters
into
the
daily
newspaper
from
alone
each
type
is
marked
upon
one
side
by
slight
nicks
by
sight
and
touch
of
which
the
compositor
is
guided
in
rapidly
placing
them
right
side
up
in
the
line
they
are
taken
one
by
one
between
thumb
and
forefinger
while
the
mind
not
only
spells
out
each
word
but
is
always
carrying
phrases
and
whole
sentences
ahead
of
the
fingers
and
each
letter
syllable
and
word
is
set
in
its
order
in
lines
in
the
composing
stick
each
line
being
spaced
out
in
the
stick
so
as
to
exactly
fit
the
column
width
this
process
being
repeated
until
the
stick
is
full
then
the
stickful
is
emptied
upon
a
galley
then
when
the
page
or
the
paper
is
up
as
the
printers
phrase
it
the
galleys
are
collected
and
the
foreman
makes
up
the
pages
article
by
article
as
they
come
to
us
in
the
printed
paper
the
preliminary
processes
of
printing
proofs
from
the
galleys
reading
them
by
the
proof
readers
who
mark
the
errors
and
making
the
corrections
by
the
compositors
each
one
correcting
his
own
work
having
been
quietly
and
swiftly
going
on
all
the
while
the
page
is
made
up
on
a
portable
slab
of
iron
upon
which
it
is
sent
to
the
stereotyping
room
there
wet
stereotyping
paper
several
sheets
in
thickness
is
laid
over
the
page
and
this
almost
pulpy
paper
is
rapidly
and
dexterously
beaten
evenly
all
over
with
stiff
hair
brushes
until
the
soft
paper
is
pressed
down
into
all
the
interstices
between
the
type
then
this
is
covered
with
blankets
and
the
whole
is
placed
upon
a
steam
chest
where
it
is
subjected
to
heat
and
pressure
until
the
wet
paper
becomes
perfectly
dry
then
this
dried
and
hardened
paper
called
a
matrix
is
placed
in
a
circular
mould
and
melted
stereotype
metal
is
poured
in
and
cooled
resulting
in
the
circular
plate
which
is
rapidly
carried
to
the
press
room
clamped
upon
its
cylinder
and
when
all
the
cylinders
are
filled
page
by
page
in
proper
sequence
the
pressman
gives
the
signal
the
burr
and
whirr
begin
and
men
and
scarcely
less
sentient
machines
enter
upon
their
swift
race
for
the
early
trains
as
a
matter
of
general
interest
it
may
be
remarked
that
this
whole
process
of
stereotyping
a
page
from
the
time
the
type
leaves
the
composing
room
until
the
plate
is
clamped
upon
the
press
averages
fifteen
minutes
and
that
cases
are
upon
record
when
the
complex
task
has
been
accomplished
in
eleven
minutes
the
paper
is
brought
from
the
mill
tightly
rolled
upon
wooden
or
iron
cores
some
presses
take
paper
the
narrow
way
of
the
paper
rolls
for
which
average
between
and
pounds
others
work
upon
paper
of
double
the
width
of
two
pages
that
is
four
pages
wide
and
then
the
rolls
are
sometimes
as
wide
as
six
feet
and
have
an
average
weight
of
pounds
each
roll
from
which
the
new
york
is
printed
contains
an
unbroken
sheet
feet
miles
long
a
few
hours
before
the
paper
is
to
be
printed
an
iron
shaft
having
journal
ends
is
passed
through
the
core
the
roll
is
placed
in
a
frame
where
it
may
revolve
the
end
of
the
sheet
is
grasped
by
steel
fingers
and
the
roll
is
unwound
at
a
speed
of
from
to
miles
an
hour
while
a
spray
of
water
plays
evenly
across
its
width
so
that
the
entire
sheet
is
unrolled
dampened
for
the
better
taking
of
the
impression
to
be
made
upon
it
and
firmly
rewound
all
in
twenty
minutes
each
of
these
rolls
will
make
about
copies
of
the
when
all
is
ready
paper
and
stereotyped
pages
in
place
and
all
adjustments
carefully
attended
to
the
almost
thinking
machine
starts
at
the
pressman
touch
and
with
well
nigh
incredible
speed
prints
places
sheet
within
sheet
pastes
the
parts
together
cuts
folds
and
counts
out
the
completed
papers
with
an
accuracy
and
constancy
beyond
the
power
of
human
eye
and
hand
the
printing
press
has
held
its
own
in
the
rapid
advance
of
that
wonderful
evolution
which
within
the
last
half
century
in
every
phase
of
thought
and
in
every
movement
of
material
forces
placed
under
the
dominion
of
men
has
almost
made
one
of
our
years
the
equivalent
of
one
of
the
old
centuries
within
average
recollection
the
single
cylinder
printing
machine
run
by
hand
or
steam
and
able
under
best
conditions
to
print
one
side
of
a
thousand
sheets
in
one
hour
was
the
marvel
of
mankind
in
one
such
that
we
started
in
an
eastern
ohio
town
drew
such
crowds
of
wondering
that
we
were
obliged
to
bar
the
open
doorway
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
which
would
allow
the
astonishing
thing
to
work
at
all
in
the
united
states
alone
five
millions
of
dollars
are
invested
in
the
building
of
printing
presses
many
of
which
by
slightest
violence
to
figure
of
speech
do
think
and
speak
inspiration
was
not
wholly
a
thing
of
ages
for
if
ever
men
received
into
brain
and
worked
out
through
hand
the
divine
touch
then
were
hoe
and
scott
and
campbell
taught
of
god
under
existing
conditions
newspapers
of
any
importance
in
the
smaller
cities
use
one
and
sometimes
two
presses
capable
of
producing
from
to
complete
eight
page
papers
each
hour
each
machine
costing
from
to
papers
of
the
second
class
in
the
large
cities
use
treble
or
quadruple
this
press
capacity
while
the
great
papers
in
the
four
or
five
leading
cities
have
machinery
plants
of
from
four
to
ten
presses
of
greatest
capacity
costing
from
to
each
and
able
to
produce
papers
of
the
different
numbers
of
pages
required
at
a
speed
of
from
to
four
page
sheets
or
of
from
to
eight
ten
or
twelve
page
sheets
per
hour
each
paper
complete
as
you
receive
it
at
your
breakfast
table
printed
pasted
cut
and
folded
and
the
entire
product
for
the
day
accurately
counted
in
lots
of
tens
fifties
hundreds
or
thousands
as
may
be
required
for
instantaneous
delivery
while
as
if
to
illustrate
and
emphasize
the
ever
upward
trend
of
public
demand
for
the
day
news
quick
and
inclusive
hoe
are
now
building
machines
capable
of
producing
in
all
completeness
four
page
papers
each
hour
all
this
tremendous
combination
of
brain
nerve
muscle
material
machinery
and
capital
depends
for
its
movement
and
remuneration
upon
but
two
sources
of
income
circulation
and
advertisements
the
unit
measurements
of
which
are
infinitesimal
for
the
most
part
represented
by
wholesale
prices
from
a
cent
to
two
cents
per
copy
for
the
daily
newspaper
and
in
like
proportion
for
the
weeklies
and
monthlies
and
by
from
of
a
cent
to
one
cent
per
line
per
thousand
of
circulation
for
advertising
space
verily
in
a
certain
and
large
sense
the
vast
publishing
interests
rest
upon
drops
of
water
and
grains
of
sand
under
right
conditions
no
kind
of
business
or
property
is
more
valuable
and
yet
no
basis
of
values
is
more
intangible
nothing
in
all
trade
or
commerce
is
so
difficult
to
establish
or
more
environed
by
competitions
and
yet
once
established
almost
nothing
save
interior
dry
rot
can
pull
it
down
it
depends
upon
the
judgment
and
favor
of
the
million
yet
instances
are
few
where
any
external
force
has
seriously
and
permanently
impaired
it
about
two
hundred
years
have
gone
since
the
publication
of
the
first
number
of
the
first
american
newspaper
it
was
a
monthly
called
occurrences
both
foreign
and
first
printed
september
by
richard
pierce
and
founded
by
benjamin
harris
at
that
time
public
favor
did
seem
to
control
newspaper
interests
for
that
first
paper
aroused
antagonism
and
it
was
almost
immediately
suppressed
by
the
authorities
only
one
copy
of
it
is
now
in
existence
and
that
is
in
london
the
first
newspaper

country
was
the

continued

really
as
we
understand
it
is
not
a

obviously
there
is
and
must
be
ceaseless
incisive
and
merciless
competition
in
securing

holding
circulations
as
well
as
in
the
outward
statements
made
of
individual
circulations
to
those
who
purchase

space
in
this
as
in
all
other
forms
of
enterprise
there
are
honest
and
methods

there
are
the
methods
of
the
the
trickster
and
the
liar
the
vastly
greater
number
of
publications
secure
and
hold
their
clientage
by
making
the
best
possible
goods
pushing
them
upon
public
patronage
by
aggressive
and
means
and
selling
at
the
lowest
price
consistent
with
excellence
of
product
and
fairness
alike
to
producer
and
consumer
but
of
the
baser
sort
there
are
always
enough
to
make
rugged
paths
for
those
who
walk
uprightly
and
to
contribute
to
instability
of
values
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
to
flooding
the
country
with
publications
which
the
home
and
the
world
would
be
better
without
every
great
city
has
more
of
the
rightly
made
and
rightly
sold
papers
than
of
the
other
sort
and
the
business
man
the
working
man
the
professional
man
the
family
no
matter
of
what
taste
or
political
faith
or
economic
bias
or
social
status
or
financial
plenty
or
paucity
can
have
the
daily
visits
of
newspapers
which
are
able
brilliant
comprehensive
clean
and
honest
but
all
the
time
these
men
and
families
will
have
pressed
upon
their
attention
and
patronage
by
every
device
and
artifice
of
the
energetic
and
more
or
less
unscrupulous
publisher
other
papers
equally
able
and
brilliant
and
comprehensive
but
bringing
also
their
burden
of
needless
sensationalism
and
mendacity
undue
expansion
of
all
manner
of
scandal
amplification
of
every
detail
and
kind
of
crime
and
every
phase
of
covert
innuendo
or
open
attack
upon
official
doing
and
private
character
the
whole
infernal
mass
procured
and
stimulated
and
broadcast
among
the
people
by
the
business
end
of
it
with
the
one
and
only
intent
of
securing
and
holding
circulation
take
a
representative
and
pertinent
example
eight
years
ago
there
were
in
new
york
ten
or
eleven
standard
newspapers
as
ably
and
inclusively
edited
and
as
energetically
and
successfully
conducted
as
they
are
now
even
at
their
worst
they
were
decently
mindful
of
life
proprieties
and
moralities
and
they
throve
by
legitimate
sale
of
the
most
and
best
news
and
the
best
possible
elucidation
and
discussion
thereof
the
father
could
bring
the
paper
of
his
choice
to
his
breakfast
table
with
no
fear
that
his
own
moral
sense
and
might
be
outraged
or
that
the
face
of
his
wife
might
be
crimsoned
and
the
minds
of
his
children
befouled
but
there
came
from
out
of
the
west
new
men
and
new
forces
quick
to
see
the
larger
opportunity
opened
in
the
very
center
of
five
millions
of
people
and
almost
in
a
night
came
the
metamorphosis
of
the
old
world
into
the
new
it
was
deftly
given
out
that
existing
conditions
were
inadequate
to
the
better
deserts
of
the
knickerbocker
the
and
the
yankee
and
that
a
new
purveyor
of
more
highly
seasoned
news
and
a
more
doughty
champion
of
their
rights
and
interests
was
hither
from
the
land
of
life
and
movement
at
two
cents
per
copy
there
was
a
panic
in
new
york
newspaper
counting
rooms
and
prices
tumbled
in
two
days
from
the
three
and
four
cents
of
fair
profit
to
the
two
and
three
cents
of
bare
cost
or
less
the
new
factors
in
demoralization
cared
nothing
for
competition
in
prices
or
legitimate
goods
for
they
had
other
ideas
of
coddling
the
dear
people
ready
to
their
purpose
lay
disintegrated
liberty
waiting
for
a
rock
upon
which
to
plant
her
feet
and
raise
her
torch
and
the
new
combination
between
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
waiting
and
ready
for
access
to
the
pockets
of
the
public
was
only
too
ready
to
set
up
liberty
and
itself
at
one
stroke
if
only
the
joint
operation
could
be
done
without
expense
to
itself
the
people
said
what
wonderful
enterprise
what
a
generous
spirit
the
combination
with
tongue
in
cheek
and
finger
laid
alongside
nose
said
to
itself
as
it
saw
its
circulation
spring
in
one
bound
from
five
figures
into
six
verily
we
got
there
for
these
on
the
hudson
are
greater
gudgeons
than
are
they
on
the
mississippi
from
then
until
now
with
an
outward
semblance
and
constant
pretense
of
serving
the
people
with
blare
of
trumpet
and
rattle
of
drum
with
finding
stanley
who
never
had
been
lost
with
scurrying
peripatetic
petticoats
around
the
globe
with
all
manner
of
unprofessional
and
illegitimate
devices
with
contests
and
with
all
manner
of
schemes
without
limit
in
number
kind
or
degree
with
every
cunningly
devised
form
of
appeal
to
curiosity
and
cupidity
from
then
until
now
that
combination
has
been
struggling
to
hold
and
has
held
an
audience
of
the
undiscriminating
and
the
unthinking
but
further
and
worse
a
instinct
of
has
led
other
papers
to
follow
somewhat
at
a
distance
in
this
demoralizing
race
none
of
them
has
gone
to
such
lengths
but
the
tendency
to
literary
mental
and
moral
dissipation
induced
by
a
hitherto
unknown
form
of
competition
has
swerved
and
largely
recast
the
methods
of
every
new
york
daily
save
only
the
and
post
while
the
converse
side
of
securing
business
clientage
is
illustrated
in
a
way
that
would
be
amusing
if
it
were
not
pathetic
by
that
abnormal
and

the

so
the
fine
art
of
telling
truth
without

is
a
live
and
perennial
study
in
many
counting
rooms
discussing
the
circulation
question
not
long
ago
with
the
head
of
a
leading
religious
paper
he
told
me
that
the
number
of
copies
he
printed
was
a
thing
that
he
never
stated
definitely
because
the
publishers
of
the
other
religious
newspapers
lied
so
about
their
circulations
that
he
would
do
himself
injustice
if
he
were
to
tell
the
truth
about
his
own
the
secular
papers
should
set
an
example
for
their
religious
brethren
but
they
do
not
for
from
many
of
them
there
is
lying
systematic
persistent
and
more
or
less
colossal
not
long
ago
within
a
few
days
of
each
other
three
men
who
were
simultaneously
employed
on
a
certain
paper
told
me
their
circulation
too
one
of
them
put
it
at
the
second
at
and
the
third
at
and
each
of
them
lied
for
their
lying
was
so
diversified
and
entertaining
that
i
felt
a
real
interest
in
securing
the
truth
and
so
i
took
some
trouble
to
ask
the
pressman
about
it
he
told
me
confidentially
that
it
was
and
he
lied
by
this
time
my
interest
was
so
heightened
that
i
told
my
personal
friend
the
publisher
about
the
inartistic
and
incoherent
mendacity
of
his
subordinates
whereupon
he
laughingly
showed
me
his
circulation
book
which
clearly
and
i
have
no
doubt
truthfully
exhibited

unsold
copies
nominally
sold
but
sooner
or
later
returned

finally
sold
to

and
all
that
sort
of
thing
one
prints
a
large
extra
issue
on
a
certain
day
for
some
business
corporation
which
has
its
own
purpose
to
serve
by
publication
of
an
article
in
its
own
interest
whereby
many
thousands
of
copies
are
added
to
that
day
normal
output
and
he
makes
the
exceptional
number
for
that
day
serve
as
the
exponent
of
his
circulation
until
good
fortune
brings
him
a
similar
and
possibly
larger
order
and
his
circulation
is
reported
as
still
increasing

struck
a
mark
of
the
day
after
cleveland
was

that
has
been
the
implied
measure
of
circulation
for
the
last
six
years

campaign
or
a
great

crisis
or
some
other

factor

gained
does

duty
in
the
eyes
of
the

until
another
flood
tide
sweeps
him
to
a
greater
transient
height
these
are
types
of
the
competitions
of
the
circulation
liar
at
this
very
hour
there
are
four
daily
newspapers
each
of
which
has
the
largest
circulation
in
the
united
states
of
the
nearly
american
publications
only
furnish
detailed
open
and
entirely
trustworthy
statements
of
circulation
as
to
the
general
public
this
is
no
great
matter
but
to
the
vast
number
of
business
men
who
buy
the
real
or
fancied
publicity
afforded
by
newspaper
advertising
it
is
of
exceeding
importance
that
the
large
buyers
of
advertising
space
are
not
more
and
oftener
swindled
is
because
they
understand
the
circulation
extravaganza
and
buy
space
according
to
their
understanding
the
time
is
coming
and
it
should
come
soon
when
newspaper
circulations
shall
be
open
to
the
same
inspection
and
publicity
as
is
now
the
case
with
banks
and
insurance
companies
and
when
the
circulation
liar
and
swindler
shall
be
amenable
to
the
same
law
and
liable
to
the
same
penalty
as
stands
against
and
is
visited
upon
any

new

in
the
may
number
of
the
i
furnished
some
contribution
to
the
treatment
of
hay
fever
i
reported
therein
a
favorable
result
in
the
treatment
of
this
mysterious
disease
in
the
experience
of
my
last
year
cases
my
experience
of
this
year
is
far
more
gratifying
and
worthy
of
receiving
a
wide
publicity
i
treated
six
cases
in
all
four
of
which
have
been
habitual
for
years
to
hay
fever
proper
without
complications
while
the
other
two
used
to
have
the
disease
aggravated
with
reflex
asthma
and
bronchial
catarrh
i
succeeded
in
preventing
the
outbreak
of
the
disease
in
every
individual
case
the
treatment
i
applied
was
very
simple
and
consisted
of
the
following
from
the
fact
that
i
had
known
all
my
patients
from
previous
years
i
ordered
them
to
my
office
two
weeks
before
the
usual
onset
of
the
disease
i
advised
them
to
irrigate
the
nose
with
a
warm
solution
of
chloride
of
sodium
four
times
a
day
morning
noon
evening
and
on
retiring
and
a
few
minutes
after
the
cleansing
of
the
parts
had
the
nares
thoroughly
sprayed
with
peroxide
of
hydrogen
and
glycerin
half
and
half
those
subject
to
a
conjunctivitis
i
prescribed
a
two
per
cent
solution
of
boric
acid
as
a
at
this
period
no
internal
medication
was
given
but
three
days
previous
to
the
usual
onset
of
the
disease
i
prescribed
phenacetin
and
salol
five
grains
of
each
three
times
a
day
on
the
respective
expected
days
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
the
members
concerned
successively
who
have
been
in
the
habit
of
getting
the
disease
almost
invariably
at
a
certain
date
no
hay
fever
symptoms
appeared
though
everyone
had
been
the
victim
of
the
disease
for
a
great
number
of
years
varying
from
five
to
nineteen
years
standing
it
is
that
this
treatment
was
kept
up
all
through
the
season
and
as
no
symptoms
developed
the
applications
were
reduced
toward
the
termination
to
twice
and
once
a
day
the
internal
medication
however
was
stopped
after
the
expiration
of
the
first
week
and
all
the
patients
could
attend
to
their
various
respective
vocations
something
they
never
have
been
able
to
do
in
previous
years
in
two
cases
though
no
nasal
symptoms
developed
about
two
weeks
after
the
calculated
onset
slight
symptoms
of
asthma
made
their
appearance
however
i
could
easily
suppress
them
at
this
time
with
the
aid
of
the
hand
atomizer
and
ozonizer
a
very
ingenious
little
apparatus
of
which
i
gave
a
thorough
description
in
my
last
article
i
used
the
ozone
inhalations
every
four
hours
in
connection
with
the
internal
administration
of
the
following
prescription
rx
iodide
of
ammonia
fl
ex
quebracho
fl
ex
grindelia
robusta
tr
lobelia
tr
belladonna
syr
pruni
ad
teaspoonful
three
or
more
times
during
hours
however
toward
the
end
of
the
fourth
week
especially
in
one
case
a
stout
gentleman
very
grave
asthmatic
symptoms
developed
which
compelled
me
to
apply
chapman
spinal
ice
bag
as
well
as
resort
to
the
internal
administration
of
large
doses
of
codeine
during
the
paroxysm
with
the
most
beneficial
result
i
gave
also
oxygen
inhalations
a
fair
trial
in
the
two
cases
i
find
them
to
act
very
soothingly
in
the
simple
asthma
facilitating
respiration
after
a
few
minutes
but
during
the
paroxysmal
stage
they
can
not
be
utilized
for
the
reason
that
respiration
is
short
and
rapid
and
does
not
permit
of
a
control
in
the
quantity
of
the
gas
to
be
inhaled
consequently
it
is
either
of
little
use
as
a
remedy
or
if
too
much
is
taken
a
disagreeable
headache
will
be
the
consequence
during
the
catarrhal
stage
which
however
was
very
mild
compared
with
last
year
i
derived
great
benefit
from
the
administration
of
codeine
in
combination
with
terpine
hydrate
in
the
pill
form
the
codeine
has
the
advantage
over
all
other
opium
preparations
that
it
does
not
affect
the
digestive
organs
and
still
acts
in
a
soothing
manner
while
during
last
year
sickness
my
patients
lost
from
ten
to
twenty
pounds
of
their
bodily
weight
this
year
but
one
lost
eight
pounds
and
the
other
five
pounds
as
the
etiology
of
this
troublesome
disease
is
yet
enveloped
in
obscurity
we
may
fairly
conclude
by
the
success
of
my
treatment
if
it
should
meet
with
the
confirmation
of
the
profession
that
the
much
pretended
sensitive
area
situated
according
to
sajous
at
the
posterior
end
of
the
inferior
turbinated
bones
and
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
septum
or
according
to
john
mackenzie
who
locates
this
area
at
the
anterior
extremity
of
the
inferior
turbinated
bone
need
not
necessarily
be
removed
or
destroyed
by
cautery
in
order
to
accomplish
a
cure
of
hay
fever
proper
i
examined
my
patients
twice
a
week
and
the
closest
rhinoscopical
exploration
would
not
reveal
the
slightest
pathological
change
in
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
nares
now
what
is
the
etiological
factor
of
the
disease
is
it
a
specific
germ
conveyed
by
the
air
to
the
parts
and
minoris
deposited
at
the
pretended
area
or
is
the
germinal
matter
present
in
the
nasal
mucous
membrane
with
certain
persons
and
requires
only
at
a
certain
time
and
under
certain
conditions
physiological
stimulation
to
manifest
periodical
pathological
changes
which
give
rise
to
the
train
of
symptoms
called
hay
fever
dropping
all
hypothetical
reasoning
i
think
some
outside
vegetable
germ
is
causing
the
disease
in
those
predisposed
and
peroxide
of
hydrogen
acts
on
them
as
it
does
on
the
pus
corpuscles
drives
them
out
when
and
wherever
it
finds
them
i
hope
the
profession
will
give
this
new
measure
a
thorough
trial
and
report
their
the
source
of
chinese
ginger
in
the
kew
for
january
an
interesting
account
is
given
of
the
identification
of
the
plant
yielding
the
rhizome
employed
to
make
the
chinese
preserved
ginger
as
long
ago
as
percival
wright
of
trinity
college
dublin
called
the
attention
of
thiselton
dyer
to
the
fact
that
the
preserved
ginger
has
very
much
larger
rhizomes
than
and
that
it
was
quite
improbable
that
it
was
the
product
of
that
plant
the
difficulty
in
identifying
the
plant
arose
from
the
fact
that
like
many
others
cultivated
for
the
root
or
tuber
it
rarely
flowers
the
first
flowering
plant
was
sent
to
kew
from
jamaica
by
harris
the
superintendent
of
the
hope
garden
there
during
the
past
year
the
plant
has
flowered
both
at
dominica
in
the
west
indies
and
in
the
botanic
garden
at
ford
the
director
of
the
botanic
garden
at
has
identified
the
plant
as
the
source
of
the
greater
or
java
galangal
root
of
commerce
watson
of
kew
appears
to
have
been
the
first
to
suggest
that
the
chinese
ginger
plant
is
probably
a
species
of
and
possibly
identical
with
the
siam
ginger
plant
which
was
described
by
sir
hooker
in
the
tab
in
as
a
new
species
under
the
name
of
baker
in
working
up
the
scitamineæ
for
the
flora
of
british
india
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
is
not
distinct
from
the
willd
the
siam
and
chinese
gingers
are
therefore
identical

are

the
nature
of

has
long
engrossed
the
attention
of
the

their
engineers

necessity
is
forcing
them
from
discussion

action

the
subject
is
of
sufficient
interest
to
the

reader
to
devote
some
space
to
its
consideration
the
most
important
problem
however
which
the
works
to
be
undertaken
and
which
must
of
necessity
be
soon
commenced
will
have
to
solve
is
not
one
of
wharf
accommodation
or
of
increased
facilities
of
commerce
it
is
the
better
disposal
of
the
sewage
of
the
city
the
system
in
use
at
present
being
inadequate
and
growing
more
and
more
imperfect
as
the
city
and
its
population
increase
during
the
early
days
of
chicago
and
indeed
long
after
the
sewage
question
was
treated
with
primitive
simplicity
and
with
a
complete
disregard
of
sanitary
laws
the
river
and
the
lake
in
front
of
the
city
were
close
at
hand
and
convenient
to
receive
all
the
discharge
from
the
drains
that
flowed
into
them
but
this
condition
of
things
had
to
come
to
an
end
for
the
lake
supplied
the
population
with
water
and
it
became
too
contaminated
for
use
to
obtain
even
this
temporary
relief
involved
much
of
the
ground
level
of
the
city
being
raised
to
a
height
of
above
low
water
a
great
undertaking
carried
out
a
number
of
years
ago
to
obtain
an
adequate
supply
of
pure
water
chesborough
the
city
engineer
adopted
the
ingenious
plan
of
driving
a
long
tunnel
beneath
the
bed
of
the
lake
connected
at
the
outer
end
to
an
inlet
tower
built
in
the
water
and
on
shore
to
pumping
engines
this
plan
proved
so
successful
that
it
is
now
being
repeated
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
a
much
longer
tunnel
to
meet
the
increased
demands
of
the
large
population
but
to
improve
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
city
has
been
a
much
more
difficult
undertaking
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
extract
from
an
official
report
the
present
sanitary
condition
calls
loudly
for
relief

pollution
of
the
desplaines
and
the

indescribable
the
spewing
of
the

contents
into
the

constantly
discharging
therein
clouds
the
source
of
water
supply
the
lake
with
contamination
relief
to
chicago
and
equity
to
her
neighbors
is
a
necessity
of
the
early
future
to
make
this
quotation
clear
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
actual
condition
of
the
chicago
sewage
question
long
before
the
present
metropolis
had
arrived
at
the
title
and
dignity
of
a
city
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
a
waterway
between
lake
michigan
and
the
illinois
river
and
thence
to
the
mississippi
was
well
understood
the
scheme
was
in
fact
considered
of
sufficient
importance
to
call
for
legislation
as
early
as
in
which
year
an
act
was
passed
authorizing
the
construction
of
a
canal
having
this
object
it
was
not
commenced
however
till
and
was
opened
to
navigation
in
the
spring
of
this
canal
extended
from
chicago
to
la
salle
a
distance
of
miles
and
it
had
a
fall
of
to
low
water
in
the
illinois
river
see
fig
it
was
only
a
small
affair
deep
and
wide
on
the
surface
the
locks
were
long
and
wide
the
summit
level
which
was
only
above
the
lake
was
miles
in
length
this
limited
waterway
remained
in
use
for
a
number
of
years
until
in
fact
the
growth
of
chicago
rendered
it
impossible
to
allow
the
sewage
to
flow
any
longer
into
the
lake
in
the
state
of
illinois
sanctioned
widening
and
lowering
the
canal
so
that
it
should
flow
by
gravity
from
lake
michigan
the
enlargement
was
completed
in
by
the
city
of
chicago
and
the
sewage
was
then
discharged
toward
the
illinois
river
but
the
flow
was
insufficient
and
in
the
state
called
on
the
city
to
supplement
the
flow
by
pumping
water
into
the
canal
illustration

in

delivering
gallons

minute
were
set
to
work
and
remedied
the
evil
for
a
time
so
far
as
the
city
of
chicago
was
concerned
but
the
large
discharge
of
sewage
through
the
sluggish
current
of
the
canal
and
into
the
illinois
river
proved
a
serious
and
nuisance
to
the
inhabitants
in
the
adjoining
districts
to
enlarge
the
existing
canal
increase
the
volume
and
speed
of
its
discharge
and
to
alter
the
levels
so
that
there
shall
be
a
relatively
rapid
stream
flowing
at
all
times
from
lake
michigan
appears
the
only
practical
means
of
affording
relief
to
the
city
and
immunity
to
other
towns
and
villages
lying
along
the
route
of
the
stream
the
physical
nature
of
the
country
is
well
suited
for
carrying
out
such
a
project
on
a
scale
far
larger
than
that
required
for
sewage
purposes
and
works
thus
carried

to

erie
which
then
became
the
outlet
for

the

dredging

would
make
and
maintain
ultimately
a
similar
depth
as
it
appears
recognized
that
the
sewage
channel
of
chicago
must
be
deep
and
as
provision
is
now
being
made
all
over
the
great
lake
system
for

drawing

a
comparatively
small
additional

would
provide

claimed
that
by
the
of

chicago
municipality

the

to
advance
a

could
be
made
from

joliet
extended
thence
to
utica
deep
and
from
there
to

deep
that
such
a
work
would
vastly
enhance
the
commerce
not

of
chicago
but
of
the
whole
section
of
the
country
through
which
the
canal
would
pass
admits
of
but
little
doubt
and
probably
the
outlay
would
be
justified
by
results
similar
to
those
achieved
with
other
great
canal
works
and
rectified

in

it
may
be
mentioned
by
way
of
comparison
that
the
traffic
on
the
suez
canal
during
the
year
was
tons
one
very
interesting
point
in
connection
with
this
work
is
the
effect
that
the
diversion
of
so
large
a
body
of
water
from
the
lakes
will
have
upon
their
at
least
cubic
feet
a
second
would
be
taken
from
lake
michigan
and
find
its
way
into
the
mississippi
this
is
approximately
per
cent
of
the
total
amount
that
now
passes
through
the
clair

and
thence
over

and
the
discharge
from
them

area
above

superior
huron
and

the
average
variation
in
level
of
the
lakes
is
from
in
to
in
during
the
year
and
the
range
in
evaporation
from
year
to
year
is
also
very
considerable
thus
the
evaporation
per
second
on
huron
and
michigan
as
given
in
the
table
above
is
nearly
but
the
figures
for
another
year
show
nearly
per
second
which
would
represent
a
difference
of
in
in
water
level
as
a
discharge
of
cubic
feet
a
second
into
the
new
canal
would
lower
the
level
of
these
two
lakes
by
in
in
a
year
it
follows
that
the
difference
between
a
year
of
maximum
and
one
of
minimum
evaporation
is
more
than
twice
as
great
as
would
be
required
for
the
canal
and
even
under
the
most
unfavorable
conditions
the
volume
taken
from
the
whole
chain
of
lakes
would
not
lower
them
an
inch
when
the
variations
in
level
due
to
different
causes
rain
wind
and
evaporation
being
the
chief
are
taken
into
consideration
the
effect
of
cubic
feet
a
second
abstracted
would
probably
not
be
noticeable
that
this
would
be
so
is
the
opinion
after
careful
investigation
of
many
eminent
american
engineers
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
similar
unanimity
of
opinion
as
to
the
advantages
that
would
be
obtained
in
the
condition
of
the
mississippi
by
adding
to
it
a
tributary
of

importance

burnham
he
was
the
oldest
turbine
wheel
manufacturer
living
having
been
actually
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
turbines
since
he
first
made
and
sold
the
french
jonval
turbine
which
was
then
the
best
turbine
made
but
being
complicated
in
construction
it
soon
wore
out
and
leaked
from
the
experience
he
had
from
this
wheel
he
invented
and
patented
his
improved
jonval
turbine
which
was
very
simply
constructed
and
yielded
a
greater
percentage
of
power
than
the
french
jonval
turbines
hundreds
of
these
improved
wheels
which
were
put
in
operation
between
the
years
and
are
still
in
use
we
show
no
cut
of
this
wheel
but
it
had
four
chutes
instead
of
six
as
shown
in
march
patent
the
first
wheel
inch
made
after
the
patent
was
granted
was
sold
to
brightwell
davis
farmville
and
put
into
their
flour
mill
under
six
feet
head
in
brightwell
davis
sold
their
mill
to
scott
davis
afterward
davis
owned
and
operated
the
mill
and
put
in
one
patent
new
turbine
in
the
farmville
mill
company
bought
and
remodeled
the
mill
to
roller
process
and
required
more
power
than
the
old
jonval
turbine
and
new
turbine
would
yield
and
on
sold
the
farmville
mill
company
two
inch
new
improved
standard
turbines
to
displace
the
two
old
wheels
in
he
commenced
experimenting
with
different
forms
of
buckets
and
chutes
and
used
six
chutes
instead
of
four
as
first
made
and
was
granted
patent
march
this
addition
of
chutes
proved
beneficial
as
the
wheel
worked
better
with
the
gates
partly
opened
than
it
did
with
four
chutes
his
next
invention
was
granted
him
which
he
called
improved
central
and
vertical
discharge
turbine
this
improvement
consisted
in
making
the
guide
blade
straight
on
the
outside
instead
of
rounding
as
then
made
by
all
others
from
inner
point
back
to
bolt
or
gudgeon
and
thick
enough
at
the
latter
point
to
let
water
pass
without
being
obstructed
by
said
bolt
and
the
arrangement
for
shifting
the
water
guides
two
wheels
of
this
pattern
were
built
and
put
into
operation
but
they
soon
commenced
leaking
water
and
became
troublesome
on
account
of
the
many
small
pieces
of
castings
and
bolts
and
were
abandoned
as
worthless
there
are
several
manufacturers
of
this
style
of
wheel
that
advertise
them
as
simple
and
durable
such
a
complicated
case
with
twelve
chutes
can
not
be
made
to
operate
unless
by
a
large
number
of
castings
bolts
and
studs
with
these
adjustable
water
guides
one
of
the
objects
was
obtained
admitting
the
water
to
the
wheel
through
chutes
corresponding
in
height
to
the
outer
edge
of
buckets
exposed
but
not
placing
the
water
against
the
face
of
the
buckets
at
right
angles
with
the
center
of
the
wheel
except
when
the
guide
blades
were
full
opened
for
as
the
guides
are
changed
so
is
the
current
of
the
water
likewise
changed
after
making
several
differently
constructed
wheels
and
testing
them
a
number
of
times
he
selected
the
best
one
and
obtained
a
patent
for
it
march
and
called
it
new
turbine
which
he
still
further
improved
and
patented
may
this
new
turbine
consisted
of
the
former
improved
jonval
wheel
hub
and
buckets
with
a
new
circular
case
and
new
form
of
chutes
having
a
register
gate
entirely
surrounding
the
case
and
having
apertures
corresponding
to
those
in
the
case
for
admitting
water
to
the
wheel
this
register
gate
was
moved
by
means
of
a
segment
and
pinion
this
new
turbine
soon
gained
for
itself
a
reputation
enjoyed
by
no
other
water
wheel
it
was
selected
by
the
united
states
patent
office
and
put
at
work
in
room
to
run
a
pump
which
forces
water
to
the
top
of
the
building
it
was
likewise
selected
by
the
japan
commission
when
they
were
in
this
country
to
select
samples
of
our
best
machines
he
continued
making
the
patent
and
improved
in
new
turbine
but
a
few
years
for
as
long
as
he
could
detect
a
defect
in
the
wheel
case
or
gate
he
continued
improving
and
simplifying
them
and
in
he
erected
a
very
complete
testing
flume
also
made
a
very
sensitive
dynamometer
it
having
a
combination
screw
for
tightening
the
friction
band
which
required
turns
to
make
one
inch
and
commenced
making
and
experimenting
with
different
constructed
turbines
he
made
five
different
wheels
and
made
over
a
hundred
tests
before
he
was
satisfied
application
was
then
made
for
a
patent
which
was
granted
march
for
his
standard
turbine
this
standard
turbine
was
a
combination
of
his
former
improvements
with
the
cover
extending
over
top
of
the
gate
to
prevent
it
from
tilting
and
an
eccentric
wheel
working
in
cam
yoke
to
open
and
close
the
gate
thousands
of
standard
turbines
are
working
and
giving
the
best
satisfaction
and
we
venture
to
say
that
not
one
of
the
standard
turbines
has
been
displaced
by
any
other
make
of
turbine
which
gave
better
results
for
the
water
used
in
he
again
commenced
experimenting
to
find
out
how
much
water
could
be
put
through
a
wheel
of
given
diameter
after
making
and
testing
several
wheels
it
was
found
that
the
amount
of
water
with
full
gate
drawn
named
in
tables
found
in
burnham
latest
catalogue
for
each
size
wheel
yielded
per
cent
and
that
the
water
used
with
gate
drawn
yielded
the
same
percentage
or
with
gate
per
gate
and
gate
per
cent
a
patent
for
the
mechanism
was
applied
for
and
granted
march
and
named
burnham
improved
standard
turbine
it
was
found
that
the
brackets
with
brass
rollers
attached
to
prevent
the
gate
from
rising
and
tilting
and
rubbing
the
curb
soon
wore
and
allowed
the
gate
to
rub
against
the
curb
and
he
experimented
with
several
devices
of
gate
arms
while
so
engaged
he
found
that
the
great
weight
of
water
on
the
top
of
the
cover
sprang
it
causing
the
sleeve
bearing
on
the
under
side
of
the
cover
to
be
thrown
out
of
place
and
the
gate
pressed
so
hard
against
the
case
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
move
it
and
after
thoroughly
testing
with
the
different
devices
of
gate
arms
application
was
made
and
patent
granted
for
adjustable
gate
arms
also
for
the
new
worm
gate
gearing
may
and
named
burham
new
improved
standard
turbine
this
he
improved
and
patented
may
to
run
on
horizontal
shaft
in
the
year
he
had
two
patents
granted
him
for
improvement
in
water
wheels
but
never
had
any
wheels
built
of
that
pattern
after
completing
and
patents
granted
for
his
new
improved
standard
turbine
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
often
remarked
i
can
not
improve
on
my
register
gate
turbine
any
more
as
it
is
as
near
perfection
as
can
be
made
and
he
was
fully
convinced
for
the
past
year
he
was
experimenting
with
a
cylinder
gate
turbine
and
patent
was
granted
previously
he
had
made
a
wheel
which
was
tested
at
holyoke
testing
flume
and
gave
fair
results
and
at
the
time
of
his
demise
he
was
having
made
a
new
runner
for
the
cylinder
gate
turbine
which
we
will
complete
and
have
tested
his
idea
was
to
have
us
manufacture
and
sell
register
and
cylinder
gate
turbines
his
inventive
powers
were
not
confined
to
water
wheels
for
on
patents
were
granted
him
for
automatic
steam
engine
governor
and
lubricating
device
we
also
remember
in
the
year
or
when
his
mind
was
occupied
with
his
standard
turbine
he
was
hindered
by
some
device
used
now
on
locomotives
of
the
present
construction
what
it
was
we
are
unable
to
say
but
when
draughting
at
his
water
wheel
would
conflict
the
two
and
by
his
invitation
we
wrote
to
a
prominent
locomotive
builder
and
had
him
examine
the
drawings
which
he
had
not
fully
completed
and
sold
same
to
him
of
this
we
only
have
a
faint
recollection
but
do
recollect
his
saying
well
that
is
off
my
mind
now
and
i
can
devote
it
to
the
finishing
of
my
new
wheel
alternate
current
condensers
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
physical
society
london
james
swinburne
read
a
paper
on
alternate
current
condensers
it
is
he
said
generally
assumed
that
there
is
no
difficulty
in
making
commercial
condensers
for
high
pressure
alternating
currents
the
first
difficulty
is
insulation
for
the
dielectric
must
be
very
thin
else
the
volume
of
the
condenser
is
too
great
some
dielectrics
mm
thick
can
be
made
to
stand
up
to
volts
when
in
small
pieces
but
in
complete
condensers
a
much
greater
margin
must
be
allowed
another
difficulty
arises
from
absorption
and
whenever
this
occurs
the
apparent
capacity
is
greater
than
the
calculated
supposing
the
fibers
of
paper
in
a
paper
condenser
to
be
conductors
embedded
in
insulating
hydrocarbon
then
every
time
the
condenser
is
charged
the
fibers
have
their
ends
at
different
potentials
so
a
current
passes
to
equalize
them
and
energy
is
lost
this
current
increases
the
capacity
one
condenser
made
of
paper
boiled
in
ozokerite
took
an
abnormally
large
current
and
heated
rapidly
at
a
high
temperature
it
gave
off
water
and
the
power
wasted
and
current
taken
gradually
decreased
when
a
thin
plate
of
mica
is
put
between
tin
foils
it
heats
excessively
and
the
fall
of
potential
over
the
air

separating
the
mica
and
foil
is
great
enough
to
cause
disruptive
discharge
to
the
surface
of
the
mica
there
appears
to
be
a
luminous
layer
of
minute
sparks
under
the
foils
and
there
is
a
strong
smell
of
ozone
in
a
dielectric
which
heats
there
may
be
three
kinds
of
conduction
metallic
when
an
ordinary
conductor
is
embedded
in
an
insulator
disruptive
as
probably
occurs
in
the
case
of
mica
and
electrolytic
which
might
occur
in
glass
in
a
transparent
dielectric
the
conduction
must
be
either
electrolytic
or
disruptive
otherwise
light
vibrations
would
be
damped
the
dielectric
loss
in
a
cable
may
be
serious
calculating
from
the
waste
in
a
condenser
made
of
paper
soaked
in
hot
ozokerite
the
loss
in
one
of
the
deptford
mains
came
out
watts
another
effect
observed
at
deptford
is
a
rise
of
pressure
in
the
mains
there
is
as
yet
no
authoritative
statement
as
to
exactly
what
happens
and
it
is
generally
assumed
that
the
effect
depends
on
the
relation
of
capacity
to
and
is
a
sort
of
resonator
action
this
would
need
a
large
and
a
small
change
of
speed
would
stop
the
effect
the
following
explanation
is
suggested
when
a
condenser
is
put
on
a
dynamo
the
condenser
current
leads
relatively
to
the
electromotive
force
and
therefore
strengthens
the
field
magnets
and
increases
the
pressure
illustration
and
are
large
transformers
and
are
small
transformers
or
voltmeters
and
the
numbers
represent
their
conversion
ratios
in
order
to
test
this
the
following
experiment
was
made
for
the
author
by
bourne
a
gramme
alternator
was
coupled
to
the
low
pressure
coil
of
a
transformer
and
a
hot
wire
voltmeter
put
across
the
primary
circuit
on
putting
a
condenser
on
the
high
pressure
circuit
the
voltmeter
wire
fused
the
possibility
of
making
an
alternator
excite
itself
like
a
series
machine
by
putting
a
condenser
on
it
was
pointed
out
perry
said
it
would
seem
possible
to
obtain
energy
from
an
alternator
without
exciting
the
magnets
independently
the
field
being
altogether
due
to
the
armature
currents
swinburne
remarked
that
this
could
be
done
by
making
the
rotating
magnets
a
mass
of
iron
sir
thomson
thought
swinburne
estimate
of
the
loss
in
the
deptford
mains
was
rather
high
he
himself
had
calculated
the
power
spent
in
charging
them
and
found
it
to
be
about
horse
power
and
although
a
considerable
fraction
might
be
lost
it
would
not
amount
to
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
glass
condensers
heated
and
inquired
whether
this
heating
was
due
to
flashes
passing
between
the
foil
and
the
glass
trotter
said
ferranti
informed
him
that
the
capacity
of
his
mains
was
about
microfarad
per
mile
thus
making
microfarads
for
the
seven
miles
the
heaping
up
of
the
potential
only
took
place
when
transformers
were
used
and
not
when
the
dynamos
were
connected
direct
in
the
former
case
the
increase
of
volts
was
proportional
to
the
length
of
main
used
and
at
deptford
gave
at
london
blakesley
described
a
simple
method
of
determining
the
loss
of
power
in
a
condenser
by
the
use
of
three
electrodynamometers
one
of
which
has
its
coils
separate
of
these
coils
one
is
put
in
the
condenser
circuit
and
the
other
in
series
with
a
resistance
r
shutting
the
condenser
if
be
the
reading
of
a
dynamometer
in
the
shunt
circuit
and
that
of
the
divided
dynamometer
the
power
lost
is
given
by
r
where
b
and
c
are
the
constants
of
the
instruments
on
which
and
are
the
respective
readings
thompson
asked
if
swinburne
had
found
any
dielectric
which
had
no
absorption
so
far
as
he
was
aware
pure
quartz
crystal
was
the
only
substance
forbes
said
hopkinson
had
found
a
glass
which
showed
none
sir
william
thomson
referring
to
the
same
subject
said
that
many
years
ago
he
made
some
tests
on
glass
bottles
which
showed
no
appreciable
absorption
sulphuric
acid
was
used
for
the
coatings
and
he
found
them
to
be
completely
discharged
by
an
instantaneous
contact
of
two
balls
the
duration
of
contact
would
according
to
some
remarkable
mathematical
work
done
by
hertz
in
be
about
second
and
even
this
short
time
sufficed
to
discharge
them
completely
on
the
other
hand
leyden
jars
with
tinfoil
coatings
showed
considerable
absorption
and
this
he
thought
due
to
want
of
close
contact
between
the
foil
and
the
glass
to
test
this
he
suggested
that
mercury
coatings
be
tried
kapp
considered
the
loss
of
power
in
condensers
due
to
two
causes
first
that
due
to
the
charge
soaking
in
and
second
to
imperfect
elasticity
of
the
dielectric
speaking
of
the
extraordinary
rise
of
pressure
on
the
deptford
mains
he
said
he
had
observed
similar
effects
with
other
cables
in
his
experiments
the
sparking
distance
of
a
volt
transformer
was
increased
from
of
an
inch
to
inch
by
connecting
the
cables
to
its
terminals
no
difference
was
detected
between
the
sparking
distances
at
the
two
ends
of
the
cable
nor
was
any
rise
of
pressure
observed
when
the
cables
were
joined
direct
on
the
dynamo
in
his
opinion
the
rise
was
due
to
some
kind
of
resonance
and
would
be
a
maximum
for
some
particular
frequency
mordey
mentioned
a
peculiar
phenomenon
observed
in
the
manufacture
of
his
alternators
each
coil
he
said
was
tested
to
double
the
pressure
of
the
completed
dynamo
but
when
they
were
all
fitted
together
their
insulation
broke
down
at
the
same
volts
the
difficulty
had
been
overcome
by
making
the
separate
coils
to
stand
much
higher
pressures
rucker
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
dielectrics
alter
in
volume
under
electric
stress
and
said
that
if
the
material
was
imperfectly
elastic
some
loss
would
result
the
president
said
that
as
some
doubt
existed
as
to
what
ferranti
had
actually
observed
he
would
illustrate
the
arrangements
by
a
diagram
speaking
of
condensers
he
said
he
had
recently
tried
lead
plates
in
water
to
get
large
capacities
but
so
far
had
not
been
successful
swinburne
in
replying
said
he
had
not
made
a
perfect
condenser
yet
for
although
he
had
some
which
did
not
heat
much
they
made
a
great
noise
he
did
not
see
how
the
rise
of
pressure
observed
by
ferranti
and
kapp
could
be
due
to
resonance
kapp
experiment
was
not
conclusive
for
the
length
of
spark
is
not
an
accurate
measure
of
electromotive
force
as
regards
mordey
observation
he
thought
the
action
explicable
on
the
theory
of
the
leading
condenser
current
acting
on
the
field
magnets
the
same
explanation
is
also
applicable
to
the
deptford
case
for
when
the
dynamo
is
direct
on
the
condenser
current
is
about
amperes
and
this
exerts
only
a
small
influence
on
the
strongly
magnetized
magnets
when
transformers
are
used
the
field
magnets
are
weak
while
the
condenser
current
rises
to
amperes
blakesley
method
of
determining
losses
was
he
said
inapplicable
except
where
the
currents
were
sine
functions
of
the
time
and
consequently
could
not
be
used
to
determine
loss

to

we
will
now
proceed
to
give
a
few
particulars
regarding
the
companies
having
cables
from
europe
to
america
the
most
important
company
is
the
telegraph
company
whose
history
is
inseparably
connected
with
that
of
the
trials
and
struggles
of
the
pioneers
of
cable
laying
its
history
begins
in
when
tebets
an
american
and
gisborne
an
english
engineer
formed
the
electric
telegraph
company
of
newfoundland
and
laid
down
twelve
miles
of
cable
between
cape
breton
and
nova
scotia
this
company
was
shortly
afterward
dissolved
and
its
property
transferred
to
the
telegraphic
company
of
new
york
newfoundland
and
london
founded
by
cyrus
field
and
who
in
obtained
an
extension
of
the
monopoly
from
the
government
to
lay
cables
a
cable
miles
long
was
laid
between
cape
breton
and
newfoundland
field
then
came
to
england
and
floated
an
english
company
which
amalgamated
with
the
american
one
under
the
title
of
the
atlantic
telegraph
company
the
story
of
the
laying
of
the
atlantic
cables
of
and
their
success
and
failures
has
often
been
told
so
we
need
not
go
into
any
details
it
may
be
noted
however
that
communication
was
first
established
between
valentia
and
newfoundland
on
august
but
the
cable
ceased
to
transmit
signals
on
september
following
during
that
period
messages
had
been
sent
from
valentia
and
two
hundred
and
from
newfoundland
at
the
present
time
the
ten
atlantic
cables
now
convey
about
ten
thousand
messages
daily
between
the
two
continents
the
losses
attending
the
laying
of
the
cable
resulted
in
the
financial
ruin
of
the
atlantic
company
and
its
amalgamation
with
the
in
the
great
eastern
successfully
laid
the
first
cable
for
the
new
company
and
with
the
assistance
of
other
vessels
succeeded
in
picking

the
broken
end
of
the
cable
and
completing
its

it
itself
starts
a

and
coutances
france
and
a
word
now
as
to
the
instruments
used
for
the
transmission
of
messages
those
for
cables
are
of
two
kinds
the
mirror
galvanometer
and
the
siphon
recorder
both
the
product
of
sir
wm
thomson
great
inventive
genius
when
the
and
other
short
cables
were
first
worked
it
was
found
that
the
ordinary
needle
instrument
in
use
on
land
lines
was
not
sufficiently
sensitive
to
be
affected
trustworthily
by
the
ordinary
current
it
was
possible
to
send
through
a
cable
either
the
current
must
be
increased
in
strength
or
the
instruments
used
must
be
more
sensitive
the
latter
alternative
was
chosen
and
the
mirror
galvanometer
was
the
result
the
principle
on
which
this
instrument
works
may
be
briefly
described
thus
the
transmitted
current
of
electricity
causes
the
deflection
of
a
small
magnet
to
which
is
attached
a
mirror
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
a
beam
of
light
is
reflected
from
a
properly
arranged
lamp
by
the
mirror
on
to
a
paper
scale
the
dots
and
dashes
of
the
morse
code
are
indicated
by
the
motions
of
the
spot
of
light
to
the
right
and
left
respectively
of
the
center
of
the
scale
the
mirror
galvanometer
is
now
almost
entirely
superseded
by
the
siphon
recorder
this
is
a
somewhat
complicated
apparatus
with
the
details
of
which
we
need
not
trouble
our
readers
suffice
it
for
us
to
explain
that
a
suspended
coil
is
made
to
communicate
its
motions
by
means
of
fine
silk
fibers
to
a
very
fine
glass
siphon
one
end
of
which
dips
into
an
insulated
metallic
vessel
containing
ink
while
the
other
extremity
rests
when
no
current
is
passing
just
over
the
center
of
a
paper
ribbon
when
the
instrument
is
in
use
the
ink
is
driven
out
of
the
siphon
in
small
drops
by
means
of
an
electrical
arrangement
and
the
ribbon
underneath
is
at
the
same
time
caused
to
pass
underneath
its
point
by
means
of
clockwork
if
a
current
be
now
sent
through
the
line
the
siphon
will
move
above
or
below
the
central
line
thus
giving
a
permanent
record
of
the
message
which
the
mirror
instrument
does
not
the
waves
written
by
the
siphon
above
the
central
line
corresponding
to
the
dots
of
the
morse
code
and
the
waves
underneath
corresponding
to
the
dashes
the
cost
of
the
transmission
of
a
cablegram
varies
from
one
shilling
per
word
the
rate
to
new
york
and
east
of
the
mississippi
to
ten
shillings
and
seven
pence
per
word
the
rate
to
new
zealand
in
order
to
minimize
that
cost
as
much
as
possible
the
use
of
codes
whereby
one
word
is
made
to
do
duty
for
a
lengthy
phrase
is
much
resorted
to
of
course
those
code
messages
form
a
series
of
words
having
no
apparent
relation
to
each
other
but
occasionally
queer
sentences
result
from
the
chance
grouping
of
the
code
words
thus
a
certain
tea
firm
was
once
astonished
to
receive
from
its
agent
abroad
the
startling
code
message
unboiled
babies
detested
suppose
we
now
follow
the
adventures
of
a
few
cablegrams
in
their
travels
over
the
world
a
message
to
india
from

by

requires
to
be

eight

at
the

messages
from
london
to
new
york
are
transmitted
only
twice
at
the
irish
or
cornwall
stations
and
at
the
stations
in
canada
owing
to
the
great
competition
for
the
american
traffic
the
service
between
london
liverpool
and
glasgow
and
new
york
is
said
to
be
much
superior
to
that
between
any
two
towns
in
britain
the
cables
are
extensively
used
by
stock
brokers
and
it
is
a
common
occurrence
for
one
to
send
a
message
and
receive
a
reply
within
five
minutes
during
breakages
in
cables
messages
have
sometimes
to
take
very
circuitous
routes
for
instance
during
the
two
days
three
years
ago
that
a
tremendous
storm
committed
such
havoc
among
the
telegraph
wires
around
london
cutting
off
all
communication
with
the
lines
connected
with
the
channel
cables
at
dover
lowestoft
it
was
of
common
occurrence
for
london
merchants
to
communicate
with
paris
through
new
york
the
cablegram
leaving
london
going
north
to
holyhead
and
ireland
across
the
atlantic
to
new
york
and
back
pierre
to
brest
and
thence
on
to
paris
a
total
distance
of
about
seven
thousand
miles
three
years
ago
when
the
great
blizzard
cut
off
all
communication
between
new
york
and
boston
messages
were
accepted
in
new
york
sent
to
this
country
and
thence
back
to
boston
some
time
ago
the
cables
between
madeira
and
vincent
were
out
of
order
cutting
off
communication
by
the
direct
route
to
brazil
and
a
message
to
reach
rio
janeiro
had
to
pass
through
ireland
canada
united
states
to
galveston
thence
to
vera
cruz
guatemala
nicaragua
panama
ecuador
peru
chili
from
valparaiso
across
the
andes
through
the
argentine
republic
to
buenos
ayres
and
thence
by
east
coast
cables
to
rio
janeiro
the
message
having
traversed
a
distance
of
about
twelve
thousand
miles
and
having
passed
through
cables
and
some
very
long
land
lines
instead
of
passing
had
it
been
possible
to
have
sent
it
by
the
direct
route
over
one
short
land
line
and
six
cables
in
all
under
six
thousand
miles
perhaps
some
of
our
readers
may
remember
having
read
in
the
newspapers
of
the
result
of
last
year
derby
having
been
sent
from
epsom
to
new
york
in
fifteen
seconds
and
may
be
interested
to
know
how
it
was
done
a
wire
was
laid
from
near
the
winning
post
on
the
race
course
to
the
cable
company
office
in
london
and
an
operator
was
at
the
instrument
ready
to
signal
the
two
or
three
letters
previously
arranged
upon
for
each
horse
immediately
the
winner
had
passed
the
post
when
the
race
began
the
cable
company
suspended
work
on
all
the
lines
from
london
to
new
york
and
kept
operators
at
the
irish
and
nova
scotian
stations
ready
to
transmit
the
letters
representing
the
winning
horse
immediately
and
without
having
the
message
written
out
in
the
usual
way
when
the
race
was
finished
the
operator
at
epsom
at
once
sent
the
letters
representing
the
winner
and
before
he
had
finished
the
third
letter
the
operator
in
london
had
started
the
first
one
to
ireland
the
clerk
in
ireland
immediately
on
bearing
the
first
signal
from
london
passed
it
on
to
nova
scotia
from
whence
it
was
again
passed
on
to
new
york
the
result
being
that
the
name
of
the
winner
was
actually
known
in
new
york
before
the
horses
had
pulled
up
after
passing
the
judge
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
such
information
could
be
transmitted
such
a
great
distance
in
fifteen
seconds
but
when
we
get
behind
the
scenes
and
see
exactly
how
it
is
accomplished
and
see
how
the
labor
and
time
of
signaling
can
be
economized
we
can
easily
realize
the
fact
the
humors
of
telegraphic
mistakes
have
often
been
described
we
will
conclude
by
giving
only
one
example
a
louis
merchant
had
gone
to
new
york
on
business
and
while
there
received
a
telegram
from
the
family
doctor
which
ran
your
wife
has
had
a
child
if
we
can
keep
her
from
having
another
all
will
be
well
as
the
little
stranger
had
not
been
expected
further
inquiry
was
made
and
elicited
the
fact
that
his
wife
had
simply
had
a
chill
this
important
difference
having
been
caused
simply
by
the
omission

this

is
of
interest
since
it
is
the
one
in
which
i
was
first
able
to
perceive
how
in
my
earlier
results
i
always
obtained
a
positive
charge
from
an
idle
pole
placed
in
the
direct
stream
from
the
negative
pole
having
got
so
far
it
was
easy
to
devise
a
form
of
apparatus
that
completely
verified
the
theory
and
at
the
same
time
threw
considerably
more
light
upon
the
subject
fig

c
is
such
a
tube
and
in
this
model
i
have
endeavored
to
show
the
electrical
state
of
it
at
a
high
vacuum
by
marking
a
number
of
and
signs
the
exhaustion
has
been
carried
to
millimeter
or

and
you
see
that
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
positive
pole
and
extending
almost
to
the
negative
the
tube
is
strongly
electrified
with
positive

the
negative
atoms
shooting
out
from
the

in
a

an

is
placed
in

position
shown
at

of
positive

negative
molecules
are
about
equal
and
no
decided
current
will
pass
from
it
through
the
galvanometer
to
earth
this
is
the
point
but
if
we
imagine
the
idle
pole
to
be
as
at
fig

then
the
positively
electrified
molecules
greatly
preponderate
over
the

is
shown
if
the

that
it

almost

to
get

actually

now
proceed
to
show
the
change
in

moving

not
succeeded
in

even
the

degree
of
exhaustion
which
my
pump
will
produce
the
subject
requires
further
investigation
and
like
other
residual
phenomena
these
discrepancies
promise
a
rich
harvest
of
future
discoveries
to
the
experimental
philosopher

as
the
waste

often
proved
the

valuable
bodies
properties
of
radiant

one
of
the
most
characteristic
attributes
of
radiant

whence
its
name
is
that
it
moves
in
approximately
straight
lines
and
in
a
direction
almost
normal
to
the
surface
of
the
electrode
if
we
keep
the
induction
current
passing
continuously
through
a
vacuum
tube
in
the

direction
we
can
imagine
two
ways
in
which
the
action
proceeds
either
the
supply
of
gaseous
molecules
at
the
surface
of
the
negative
pole
must
run
short
and
the
phenomena
come
to
an
end
or
the
molecules
must
find
some
means
of
getting
back
i
will
show
you
an
experiment
which
reveals
the
molecules
in
the
very
act
of
returning

a

from

at

time
a

for
itself

as

an
experiment

show
that
so
far
the
theory
is
right

view
of
the
state

is
advanced

as

has
set
himself
vigorously
to
the
task
of
opposing
my
conclusions
apart
from
my
desire
to
keep
controversial
matter
out
of
an
address
of
this
sort
time
would
not
permit
me
to
discuss
the
points
raised
by
my
critic
i
will
therefore
only
observe
in
passing
that
puluj
has
no
authority
for
linking
my
theory
of
a
fourth
state
of
matter
with
the
highly
transcendental
doctrine
of
four
dimensional
space
reference
has
already
been
made
to
the
mistaken
supposition
that
i
have
pronounced
the
thickness
of
the
dark
space
in
a
highly
exhausted
tube
through
which
an
induction
spark
is
passed
to
be
identical
with
the
natural
mean
free
path
of
the
molecules
of
gas
at
that
exhaustion
i
could
quote
numerous
passages
from
my
writings
to
show
that
what
i
meant
and
said
was
the
mean
free
path
as
amplified
and
modified
by
the
electrification
in
this
view
i
am
supported
by
schuster
who
in
a
passage
quoted
below
distinctly
admits
that
the
mean
free
path
of
an
electrified
molecule
may
differ
from
that
of
one
in
its
ordinary
state
footnote
the
thickness
of
the
dark
space
surrounding
the
negative
pole
is
the
measure
of
the
mean
length
of
the
path
of
the
gaseous
molecules
between
successive
collisions
the
electrified
molecules
are
projected
from
the
negative
pole
with
enormous
velocity
varying
however
with
the
degree
of
exhaustion
and
intensity
of
the
induction
part
par
the
extra
velocity
with
which
the
molecules
rebound
from
the
excited
negative
pole
keeps
back
the
more
slowly
moving
molecules
which
are
advancing
toward
the
pole
the
conflict
occurs
at
the
boundary
of
the
dark
space
where
the
luminous
margin
bears
witness
to
the
energy
of
the
part

here
then
we
see
the
induction
spark
actually
illuminating
the
lines
of
molecular
pressure

the
excitement

entirely
or
partially
changes
into

irregular
vibration
in

it
is
also
probable
that
the
absolute
velocity
of
the
molecules
is
increased
so
as
to
make
the
mean
velocity
with
which
they
leave
the
negative
pole
greater
than
that
of
ordinary
gaseous
part

footnote
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
extent
of
the
dark
space
represents
the
mean
free
path
of
the

it
has
been
pointed
out
by
others
that
the
extent
of
the
dark
space
is
really
considerably
greater
than
the
mean
free
path
of
the
molecules
calculated
according
to
the
ordinary
way
my
measurements
make
it
nearly
twenty
times
as
great
this
however
is
not
in
itself
a
fatal
objection
for
as
we
have
seen
the
mean
free
path
of
an
ion
may
be
different
from
that

the
great
difference
between
puluj
and
me
lies
in
his
statement
that
the
matter
which
fills
the
dark

consists
of
mechanical
detached
particles
of
the
electrodes
which
are
charged

attributes
all

i
from

in

energetically
to
my

radiant

then
proposes
in
its
stead
the
misleading
term
radiant

i
say
misleading
for
while
both
his
and
my
definitions
equally
admit
the
existence
of
radiant

he
drags
in
the
hypothesis
that
the
radiant

is
actually
the
disintegrated
material
of

puluj
declares
that
the
phenomena
i
have
described
in

vacua
are
produced
by
his
irregularly
shaped
lumps
of
radiant
electrode
matter
my
contention
is
that
they
are
produced
by
radiant
matter
of
the
residual
molecules
of
gas
were
it
not
that
in
this
case
we
can
turn

experimental
evidence
i
would
not
mention
the
subject
to
you
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
controversial
matter
must
have
no
place
therefore
i
content
myself
at
present
by
showing
a
few
novel
experiments
which
demonstratively
prove
my
case
let
me
first
deal
with
the
radiant
electrode
hypothesis
some
metals
it
is
well
known
such
as
silver
gold
or
platinum
when
used
for
the
negative
electrode
in
a
vacuum
tube
volatilize
more
or
less
rapidly
coating
any
object
in
their
neighborhood
with
a
very
even
film
on
this
depends
the
well
known
method
of
electrically
preparing
small
mirrors
etc
aluminum
however
seems
exempt
from
this
volatility
hence
and
for
other
reasons
it
is
generally
used
for
electrodes
if
then
the
phenomena
in
a
high
vacuum
are
due
to
the
electrode
matter
the
more
volatile
the
metal
used
the
greater
should
be
the
effect
footnote
in
a
valuable
paper
read
before
the
royal
society
november
by
professors
liveing
and
dewar
on
finely
divided
metallic
dust
thrown
off
the
surface
of
various
electrodes
in
vacuum
tubes
they
find
not
only
that
dust
however
fine
suspended
in
a
gas
will
not
act
like
gaseous
matter
in
becoming
luminous
with
its
characteristic
spectrum
in
an
electric
discharge
but
that
it
is
driven
with
extraordinary
rapidity
out
of
the
course
of
the
discharge
here
is
a
tube

with
two
negative
electrodes
aa
so
placed
as
to
protect
two
luminous
spots
on
the
phosphorescent
glass
of
the
tube
one
electrode
a
is
of
pure
silver
a
volatile
metal
the
other
a
is
of
aluminum
practically
a
quantity
of
electrode
matter
will
be
shot
off
from
the
silver
pole
and
practically
none
from
the
aluminum
pole
but
you
see
that
in
each
case
the
phosphorescence
cc
is
identical
had
the
radiant
electrode
matter
been
the
active
agent
the
more
intense
phosphorescence
would
proceed
from
the
more
volatile
pole

so
as
to
drive
off

upon

on

table
the
results

examination
the
identity

of
silver

aluminum
in
the

and
the
of

in
themselves

condemn

a
set
of

that
to
my
mind
puts
the
matter
wholly
beyond
doubt
the

contain
no
inside

the
residual
gaseous
molecules

them

passing

phenomenon

i
now

you
see
the

rotate
rapidly
reversing

as
i
reverse
the
current
here
is
an
apparatus
fig
which
shows
that
the
residual
gaseous
molecules
when
brought
to
a
focus
produce
heat
it
consists
of
a
glass
tube
with
a
bulb
blown
at
one
end
and
a
small
bundle
of
carbon
wool
c
fixed
in
the
center

exhausted

a
pressure
of

or
the
negative

a
is
formed
by
coating
part
of
the
outside

the
bulb
with
silver

it
is
in
such
a
position
that
the
focus
of

falls

the
carbon
wool
the
positive

is
an
outer
coating

other
end

tube
i
pass
the

those
who
are
close
may
see
the
bright
sparks
of
carbon
raised
to
incandescence
by
the
impact
of
the
molecular
stream
you
thus
have
seen
that
all
the
old
radiant
matter
effects
can
be
produced
in
tubes
containing
no
metallic
electrodes
to
volatilize
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
sides
of
the
tube
in
contact
with
the
outside
poles
become
electrodes
in
this
case
and
that
particles
of
the
glass
itself
may
be
torn
off
and
projected
across
and
so
produce
the
effects
this
is
a
strong
argument
which
fortunately
can
be
tested
by
experiment
in
the
case
of
this

therefore
particles
are
torn
off

projected

cause
phosphorescence
these
particles

not
be

glass

yttria

the
spot

phosphorescent

not
be
the

see

is
no
such
indication
the
glass
phosphoresces

its
usual
blue
glow

evidence

witnessing
these

i
think
you
will
agree
i
am
justified
in
adhering
to
my
original
theory
that
the
phenomena
are
caused
by
the
radiant
matter
of
the
residual
gaseous
molecules
and
certainly
not
by
the
particles
of
the
negative
electrode
phosphorescence
in
high
vacua
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
the
molecular
motions
rendered
visible
in
a
vacuum
tube
are
not
the
motions
of
molecules
under
ordinary
conditions
but
are
compounded
of
these
ordinary
or
kinetic
motions
and
the
extra
motion
due
to
the
electrical
impetus
experiments
show
that
in
such
tubes
a
few
molecules
may
traverse
more
than
a
hundred
times
the
free
path
with
a
correspondingly
increased
velocity
until
they
are
arrested
by
collisions
indeed
the
molecular
free
path
may
vary
in
one
and
the
same
tube
and
at
one
and
the
same
degree
of
exhaustion
very
many
bodies
such
as
ruby
diamond
emerald
alumina
yttria
samaria
and
a
large
class
of
earthy
oxides
and
sulphides
phosphoresce
in
vacuum
tubes
when
placed
in
the
path
of
the
stream
of
electrified
molecules
proceeding
from
the
negative
pole
the
composition
of
the
gaseous
residue
present
does
not
affect
phosphorescence
thus
the
earth
yttria
phosphoresces
well
in
the
residual
vacua

atmospherical

oxygen
nitrogen
carbonic
anhydride
hydrogen
iodine

the
point
of
maximum
phosphorescence
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
lies
on
the
margin
of
the
dark

the
diagram
fig
shows
approximately
the
degree
of
phosphorescence
in
different
parts
of
a
tube

an
internal
pressure

on

you
see
the
positive

and
the
position
inside
the
dark
space
at
which
phosphorescence
does
not
occur
the
height
of
the
curve
represents
the
degree
of
phosphorescence
the
most
decisive
effects
of
phosphorescence
are
reached
by
making
the
tube
so
large
that
the
walls
are
outside
the
dark
space
while
the
material
submitted
to
experiment
is
placed
just
at
the
edge
of
the
dark
space
hitherto
i
have
spoken
only
of
the
phosphorescence
of
substances
placed
under
the
negative
pole

from
numerous
experiments
i
find
that
bodies
will
phosphoresce
in
actual
contact
with

this
is
only
a
temporary
phenomenon

ceases
entirely
when
the

pushed
to
a
very
high

the
experiment
is
one
scarcely
possible
to
exhibit
to
an
audience
so
i
must
content
myself
with
describing
it
a
shown
in

a
flat
aluminum
pole
in
the
form
of
a
disk
at

end
both
coated

phosphorescent
yttria
as
the
rarefaction
approaches
about
millimeter
the
surface
of
the
negative
pole
a
becomes
faintly
phosphorescent
on
continuing
the
exhaustion
this
luminosity
rapidly
diminishes
not
only
in
intensity
but
in
extent
contracting
more
and
more
from
the
edge
of
the
disk
until
ultimately
it
is
visible
only
as
a
bright
spot
in
the
center
this
fact
does
not
prop
a
recent
theory
that
as
the
exhaustion
gets
higher
the
discharge
leaves
the
center
of
the
pole
and
takes
place
only
between
the
edge
and
the
walls
of
the
tube

if
the
exhaustion
is
further
pushed
then
at

lectures
recently
delivered
before
the
society
of
arts
london
from
the
of
the
society
by
vivian
lewes
having
now
brought
before
you
the
various
methods
by
which
ordinary
coal
gas
can
be
enriched
so
as
to
give
an
increased
luminosity
to
the
flame
i
wish
now
to
discuss
the
methods
by
which
the
gas
can
be
burnt
in
order
to
yield
the
greatest
amount
of
light
and
also
the
compounds
which
are
produced
during
combustion
in
the
first
lecture
while
discussing
the
theory
of
luminous
flames
i
pointed
out
that
in
an
atmospheric
burner
it
was
not
the
oxygen
of
the
air
introduced
combining
with
and
burning
up
the
hydrocarbons
and
so
preventing
the
separation
of
incandescent
carbon
which
gave
the
flame
but
the
diluting
action
of
the
nitrogen
which
acted
by
increasing
the
temperature
at
which
the
hydrocarbons
are
broken
up
and
carbon
liberated
a
fact
which
was
proved
by
observation
that
heating
the
mixture
of
gas
and
air
again
restored
the
luminosity
of
the
flame
this
experiment
clearly
shows
that
temperature
is
a
most
important
factor
in
the
illuminating
value
of
a
flame
and
this
is
still
further
shown
by
a
study
of
the
action
of
the
diluents
present
in
coal
gas
the
ones
being
far
more
deleterious
than
the
combustible
as
they
not
only
dilute
but
withdraw
heat
anything
which
will
increase
the
temperature
of
the
flame
will
also
increase
the
illuminating
power
provided
of
course
that
the
increase
in
temperature
is
not
obtained
at
the
expense
of
the
too
rapid
combustion
of
the
hydrocarbons
as
has
been
shown
in
the
experiments
relating
to
the
action
of
diluents
on
flame
already
quoted
oxygen
when
added
to
coal
gas
increases
its
illuminating
value
to
a
marked
and
increasing
degree
until
a
certain
percentage
has
been
added
after
which
the
illuminating
power
is
rapidly
decreased
until
the
point
is
reached
when
the
mixture
becomes
explosive
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
added
oxygen
increases
the
temperature
of
the
flame
by
doing
the
work
of
the
air
but
without
the
cooling
and
diluting
action
of
the
nitrogen
when
however
a
certain
proportion
is
added
it
begins
to
burn
up
the
heavy
hydrocarbons
and
although
the
temperature
goes
on
increasing
the
power
is
rapidly
diminished
by
the
diminution
of
the
amount
of
free
carbon
in
the
flame
it
has
been
proposed
to
carburet
and
enrich
poor
coal
gas
by
admixture
with
it
of
an
gas
made
under
tatham
patents
in
which
crude
oils
are
cracked
at
a
comparatively
low
temperature
and
are
there
mixed
with
from
to
per
cent
of
oxygen
gas
oil
gas
made
at
low
temperatures
is
of
little
use
as
an
illuminant
as
it
burns
with
a
smoky
flame
and
does
not
travel
well
but
when
mixed
with
a
certain
amount
of
oxygen
it
gives
a
very
brilliant
white
light
and
no
smoke
while
as
far
as
experiments
have
at
present
gone
its
traveling
powers
are
much
improved
at
first
sight
it
seems
a
dangerous
experiment
to
mix
a
heavy
hydrocarbon
gas
with
oxygen
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
although
hydrogen
and
carbon
monoxide
only
need
to
be
mixed
with
half
their
own
volume
of
oxygen
to
give
a
most
explosive
mixture
yet
as
the
number
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
atoms
in
the
combustible
gas
increase
so
does
the
amount
of
oxygen
needed
to
give
explosion
thus
coal
gas
needs
rather
more
than
its
own
volume
and
ethylene
three
times
its
volume
to
give
the
maximum
explosive
results
while
these
mixtures
begin
to
be
explosive
when
per
cent
of
oxygen
is
mixed
with
hydrogen
or
water
gas
per
cent
with
coal
gas
and
over
per
cent
of
oil
gas
of
the
character
used
it
is
claimed
that
if
this
gas
was
used
as
an
enricher
of
coal
gas
per
cent
of
it
would
increase
the
luminosity
of
gas
by
about
per
cent
oxygen
has
been
obtained
for
some
time
past
from
the
air
on
a
commercial
scale
by
the
brin
process
and
at
the
present
time
there
seems
every
prospect
of
our
being
able
to
obtain
oxygen
at
a
rate
of
about
per
cubic
feet
another
process
by
which
this
important
result
can
also
be
obtained
was
first
introduced
by
tessie
du
mothay
and
has
now
just
been
revived
it
consists
of
passing
alternate
currents
of
steam
and
air
over
sodic
manganate
heated
to
dull
redness
in
an
iron
tube
the
process
has
never
been
commercially
successful
for
the
reason
that
the
contents
of
the
tube
fused
and
flowing
over
the
surface
of
the
iron
rapidly
destroyed
the
tubes
or
retorts
and
also
as
soon
as
fusion
took
place
the
mass
became
so
dense
that
it
had
little
or
no
action
on
the
air
passing
over
it
now
however
this
difficulty
has
been
partly
overcome
by
so
preparing
the
manganate
as
to
prevent
fusion
and
to
keep
it
in
a
spongy
state
which
gives
very
high
results
and
the
substance
being
practically
everlasting
the
cost
of
production
is
extremely
low
it
is
proposed
to
feed
this
by
a
separate
system
of
pipes
to
small
gas
jets
and
by
converting
them
into
practically
oxyhydrogen
blow
pipes
to
raise
solid
masses
of
refractory
material
to
incandescence
and
also
by
supplying
oxygen
in
the
same
way
to
oil
lamps
of
particular
construction
to
obtain
a
very
great
increase
in
illuminating
power
whether
these
methods
of
employing
cheap
oxygen
would
be
successful
or
not
i
do
not
wish
to
discuss
at
the
present
time
but
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
cheap
oxygen
would
be
an
enormous
boon
to
the
gas
manager
as
by
mixing
per
cent
of
oxygen
with
his
coal
gas
before
purification
he
could
not
only
utilize
the
method
so
successfully
introduced
by
valon
at
ramsgate
but
could
also
increase
the
illuminating
value
of
his
gas
in
speaking
of
the
structure
of
flame
i
pointed
out
that
close
to
the
burner
from
which
the
gas
giving
the
flame
is
issuing
a
space
exists
in
which
no
combustion
is
going
on
in
other
words
a
flame
is
never
in
contact
with
the
rim
of
the
burner
this
is
best
seen
when
the
gas
is
turned
low
with
a
batswing
burner
for
instance
turned
so
low
that
only
a
small
flame
is
left
the
space
between
burner
and
flame
will
appear
as
great
as
the
flame
itself
while
if
the
gas
is
mixed
with
an
inert
diluent
like
carbon
dioxide
the
space
can
be
very
much
increased
several
theories
have
been
brought
forward
to
explain
this
phenomenon
but
the
true
one
is
that
the
burner
abstracts
so
much
heat
from
the
flame
at
that
point
that
it
is
unable
to
burn
there
and
this
can
be
proved
by
the
fact
that
where
a
cold
object
touches
the
flame
a
dividing
space
similar
to
that
noticed
between
flame
and
burner
will
always
be
observed
and
the
colder
the
object
and
the
more
diluted
the
gas
the
greater
is
the
observed
space
if
a
cold
metal
wire
or
rod
is
held
in
a
flame
it
causes
an
extinction
of
the
gas
for
some
considerable
space
around
itself
but
as
the
temperature
of
the
rod
rises
this
space
becomes
smaller
and
smaller
until
the
rod
is
heated
to
redness
and
then
the
flame
comes
in
contact
with
the
rod
in
the
same
way
if
the
burner
from
which
the
gas
is
issuing
be
heated
to
redness
the
space
between
burner
and
flame
disappears
it
has
already
been
shown
that
cooling
the
flame
by
an
inert
diluent
reduces
the
illuminating
value
and
finally
renders
it
more
luminous
and
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
points
which
should
be
aimed
at
in
the
construction
of
a
good
gas
burner
in
the
first
place
a
sensible
diminution
in
light
takes
place
when
a
metal
burner
is
employed
and
the
larger
the
surface
and
thickness
of
the
metal
the
worse
will
be
its
action
on
the
illuminating
power
of
the
flame
but
this
cooling
action
is
only
influencing
the
bottom
of
the
flame
so
that
with
a
small
flame
the
total
effect
is
very
great
and
with
a
very
large
flame
almost
the
first
point
therefore
to
attend
to
is
that
the
burner
shall
be
made
of
a
good
in
the
next
place
the
flow
of
the
gas
must
be
regulated
to
the
burner
as
if
you
have
a
pressure
higher
than
that
for
which
the
burner
is
constructed
you
at
once
obtain
a
roaring
flame
and
a
loss
of
illuminating
power
as
the
too
rapid
rush
of
gas
from
the
burner
causes
a
mingling
of
gas
and
air
and
a
consequent
cooling
of
the
flame
the
tap
also
which
regulates
the
flame
is
better
at
a
distance
from
the
burner
than
close
to
it
as
any
constriction
near
the
burner
causes
eddies
which
give
an
unsteady
flame
these
general
principles
govern
all
burners
and
we
will
now
take
the
ordinary
forms
in
detail
in
the
ordinary
flat
flame
burner
given
a
good
material
and
a
well
regulated
gas
supply
little
more
can
be
done
while
burning
it
in
the
ordinary
way
to
increase
its
luminosity
and
it
is
the
large
surface
of
flame
exposed
to
the
cooling
action
of
the
air
which
causes
this
form
of
burner
to
give
the
lowest
service
of
any
per
cubic
foot
of
gas
consumed
much
is
done
moreover
by
faulty
fittings
and
shades
to
reduce
the
already
poor
light
given
out
because
the
power
of
the
flame
largely
depends
upon
its
having
a
well
rounded
base
and
broad
luminous
zone
and
when
a
globe
with
a
narrow
opening
is
used
with
such
a
flame
as
is
done
in
out
of
cases
the
updraught
drags
the
flame
out
of
shape
and
seriously
impairs
its
powers
a
trouble
which
can
be
got
over
by
having
the
globe
with
an
opening
at
the
bottom
not
less
than
inches
in
diameter
and
having
small
shoulders
fixed
to
the
burner
which
draw
out
the
flame
and
protect
the
base
from
the
disturbing
influence
of
draughts
the
argand
burner
differs
from
the
flat
flame
burners
in
that
a
circular
flame
is
employed
the
air
supply
is
regulated
by
a
cylindrical
glass
and
this
form
of
burner
gives
a
better
service
than
the
flat
flame
burner
as
not
only
can
the
supply
of
gas
and
air
be
better
adjusted
but
the
air
being
slightly
warmed
by
the
hot
glass
adds
to
the
temperature
of
the
flame
which
is
also
increased
by
radiation
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
flame
itself
the
chief
loss
of
light
in
such
a
burner
depends
upon
the
fact
that
being
circular
the
light
from
the
inner
surface
has
to
pass
through
the
wall
of
flame
and
careful
photometric
experiments
show
that
the
solid
particles
present
in
the
flame
so
reduce
its
transparency
that
a
loss
amounting
to
about
per
cent
of
light
takes
place
during
its
transmission
the
height
of
the
flame
also
must
be
carefully
adjusted
to
the
size
of
the
flame
as
too
long
a
chimney
by
increasing
the
air
supply
unduly
cools
and
so
lowers
the
illuminating
power
of
the
flame
experiments
with
carbureted
water
gas
gave
the
following
results
with
a
consumption
of
cubic
feet
per
hour
size
of
chimney
height
of
flame
candle
power
x
x
x
x
for
many
years
no
advance
was
made
upon
these
forms
of
burner
but
when
ten
years
ago
it
was
recognized
that
anything
which
cools
the
flame
reduces
its
value
while
anything
which
increases
its
temperature
raises
its
illuminating
power
then
a
change
took
place
in
the
forms
of
burner
in
use
and
the
regenerative
burners
introduced
by
such
men
as
siemens
grimston
and
bower
commenced
what
was
really
a
revolution
in
gas
lighting
by
utilizing
the
heat
contained
in
the
escaping
products
of
combustion
to
raise
the
temperature
of
the
gas
and
air
which
are
to
enter
into
combination
in
the
flame
an
enormous
increase
in
the
temperature
of
the
solid
particles
of
carbon
in
the
flame
is
obtained
and
a
far
greater
and
whiter
light
is
the
result
the
bower
lamp
in
which
at
any
rate
in
the
later
forms
the
flame
burns
between
a
downward
and
an
upward
current
of
air
was
one
of
the
first
produced
and
so
well
has
it
been
kept
up
to
date
that
it
still
holds
its
own
while
as
types
of
the
inverted
cone
regenerative
burner
we
may
also
take
the
cromarty
and
wenham
lights
which
have
been
followed
by
a
host
of
imitators
and
so
closely
are
the
original
types
adhered
to
that
one
begins
seriously
to
wonder
what
the
use
of
the
patent
office
really
is
the
schulke
and
the
last
form
of
siemens
regenerative
burner
however
stand
apart
from
all
the
others
by
dealing
with
flat
and
not
conical
flames
and
in
both
regeneration
is
carried
on
to
a
high
degree
the
only
drawback
to
the
regenerative
burner
is
that
it
is
by
far
the
best
form
of
gas
stove
as
well
as
burner
and
that
the
amount
of
heat
thrown
out
by
the
radiant
solid
matter
in
the
flame
is
under
some
circumstances
an
annoyance
but
on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
forget
that
this
is
the
form
best
adapted
for
overhead
burners
and
that
nearly
every
form
of
regenerative
lamp
can
be
adapted
as
a
ventilating
agent
and
that
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
products
of
combustion
from
the
air
of
the
room
the
great
and
only
serious
objection
to
gas
as
an
illuminant
disappears
when
coal
gas
is
burned
the
hydrogen
is
supposed
to
be
entirely
converted
into
water
vapor
and
the
carbon
to
finally
escape
into
the
air
as
carbon
dioxide
and
if
this
were
so
every
cubic
foot
of
gas
consumed
would
produce
approximately
cubic
foot
of
carbon
dioxide
and
cubic
feet
of
water
vapor
while
the
illuminating
power
yielded
by
the
cubic
foot
of
gas
will
of
course
vary
with
the
kind
of
burner
used
roughly
speaking
the
ordinary
types
of
burner
give
the
following
results
illuminating
products
of
combustion
power
in
per
name
of
burner
candles
per
candle
power
of
gas
consumed
carbon
water
dioxide
vapor
batswing
argand
regenerative
so
that
the
regenerative
forms
of
burner
by
giving
the
greatest
illuminating
power
per
cubic
foot
of
gas
consumed
yield
a
smaller
amount
of
vitiation
to
the
air
per
candle
of
light
emitted
an
ordinary
room
say
x
x
would
not
be
considered
properly
illuminated
unless
the
light
were
at
least
equal
to
candle
power
and
in
the
table
below
the
amount
of
the
oxygen
used
up
and
the
products
of
combustion
formed
by
each
class
of
illuminant
and
burner
in
attaining
this
result
are
given
the
number
of
adults
who
would
exhale
the
same
amount
during
respiration
being
also
stated
from
these
data
it
appears
according
to
rules
by
which
the
degree
of
vitiation
of
the
air
in
any
confined
space
is
measured
by
the
amount
of
oxygen
used
up
and
carbon
dioxide
formed
that
candles
are
the
worst
offenders
against
health
and
comfort
oil
lamps
come
next
and
gas
least
this
however
is
an
assumption
which
practical
experience
does
not
bear
out
discomfort
and
oppression
in
a
room
lighted
by
candles
or
oil
are
less
felt
than
in
one
lighted
by
any
of
the
older
forms
of
gas
burner
and
the
partial
explanation
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
when
a
room
is
illuminated
with
candles
or
oil
people
are
contented
with
a
feebler
and
more
local
light
than
when
using
gas
in
a
room
of
the
size
described
the
inmates
would
be
more
likely
to
use
two
candles
placed
near
their
books
or
on
a
table
than

of

given
off

is

is
a

more
serious
factor
which
has
up

overlooked

that
is
that
an

ever
since
the
structure
of
flame
has
been
noted
and
discussed
it
has
been
accepted
as
a
fact
beyond
dispute
that
the
outer
almost
invisible
zone
which
is
interposed
between
the
air
and
the
luminous
zone
of
the
flame
is
the
area
of
complete
combustion
and
that
here
the
unburnt
remnants
of
the
flame
gases
meeting
the
air
freely
take
up
oxygen
and
are
converted
into
the
comparatively
harmless
products
of
combustion
carbon
dioxide
and
water
vapor
which
only
need
partial
removal
by
any
haphazard
process
of
ventilation
to
keep
the
air
of
the
room
fit
to
support
animal
life
i
have
however
long
doubted
this
fact
and
at
length
by
a
delicate
process
of
analysis
have
been
able
to
confirm
my
suspicions
the
outer
zone
of
a
luminous
flame
is
not
the
zone
of
complete
combustion
it
is
a
zone
in
which
luminosity
is
destroyed
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
it
is
destroyed
in
the
bunsen
burner
that
is
the
air
penetrating
the
flame
so
dilutes
and
cools
down
the
outer
layer
of
incandescent
gas
that
it
is
rendered
while
some
of
the
gas
sinks
below
the
point
at
which
it
is
capable
of
burning
with
the
result
that
considerable
quantities
of
the
products
of
incomplete
combustion
carbon
monoxide
and
acetylene
escape
into
the
air
and
render
it
actively
injurious
i
have
proved
this
by
taking
a
small
platinum
pipe
with
a
circular
loop
on
the
end
the
interior
of
the
loop
being
pierced
with
minute
holes
and
by
making
a
circular
flame
burn
within
the
loop
so
that
the
zone
of
the
flame
just
touched
the
inside
of
the
loop
and
then
by
aspiration
so
gentle
as
not
to
distort
the
shape
of
the
flame
withdrawing
the
gases
escaping
from
the
outer
zone
on
analyzing
these
by
a
delicate
process
which
will
be
described
elsewhere
i
arrived
at
the
following
results
gases
escaping
from
the
outer
zone
of
flame
luminous
bunsen
nitrogen
water
vapor
carbon
dioxide
carbon
monoxide
oxygen
marsh
gas
hydrogen
acetylene
nil
the
gases
leaving
the
luminous
flame
show
that
the
diluting
action
of
the
nitrogen
is
so
great
that
considerable
quantities
even
of
the
highly
inflammable
and
rapidly
burning
hydrogen
escape
combustion
while
the
products
of
incomplete
combustion
are
present
in
sufficient
quantity
to
account
perfectly
for
the
deleterious
effects
of
gas
burners
in
rooms
the
analyses
also
bring
out
very
clearly
the
fact
that
although
the
dilution
of
coal
gas
by
air
in
atmospheric
burners
is
sufficient
to
prevent
the
decomposition
of
the
heavy
hydrocarbons
with
liberation
of
carbon
and
so
destroy
luminosity
yet
the
presence
of
the
extra
supply
of
oxygen
does
make
the
combustion
far
more
perfect
so
that
the
products
of
incomplete
combustion
are
hardly
to
be
found
in
the
escaping
gases
these
experiments
are
of
the
gravest
import
as
they
show
more
clearly
than
has
ever
been
done
before
the
absolute
necessity
for
special
and
perfect
ventilation
where
coal
gas
is
employed
for
the
illumination
of
our
dwelling
rooms
when
coal
gas
was
first
employed
during
the
early
part
of
this
century
as
an
illuminating
agent
the
low
pitch
of
the
old
fashioned
rooms
and
the
excess
of
impurities
in
the
gas
rendered
it
imperative
that
the
products
of
combustion
of
the
gas
should
be
conducted
from
the
apartment
and
for
this
purpose
arrangements
of
tubes
with
funnel
shaped
openings
were
suspended
over
the
burners
the
noxious
gases
were
thus
conveyed
either
to
the
flue
or
open
air
but
this
type
of
ventilator
was
unsightly
in
the
extreme
and
some
few
attempts
were
made
to
replace
it
by
a
more
elegant
arrangement
as
in
the
ventilating
lamp
invented
by
faraday
and
in
the
adaptation
of
the
same
principle
by
rutter
who
strove
for
many
years
to
direct
attention
to
the
necessity
of
removing
the
products
of
combustion
from
the
room
but
with
the
increase
of
the
gas
industry
the
methods
for
purifying
the
coal
gas
became
gradually
more
and
more
perfect
while
the
rooms
in
the
modern
houses
were
made
more
lofty
and
the
products
of
combustion
being
mixed
with
a
larger
volume
of
air
and
not
containing
so
many
deleterious
constituents
became
if
not
much
less
noxious
at
all
events
less
perceptible
to
the
nose
as
soon
as
this
point
was
reached
the
ventilating
tubes
were
discarded
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
air
of
our
dwelling
rooms
has
been
contaminated
by
illuminants
with
hardly
an
effort
to
alleviate
the
effect
produced
upon
health
i
say
hardly
an
effort
for
the
boyle
tried
by
their
concentric
tube
ventilators
to
meet
the
difficulty
while
de
la
garde
and
hammond
have
each
constructed
lamps
more
or
less
on
the
principle
of
the
rutter
lamp
but
either
from
their
being
somewhat
unsightly
or
from
their
diminishing
the
amount
of
light
given
out
none
of
them
have
met
with
any
degree
of
success
in
places
of
public
entertainment
where
large
quantities
of
coal
gas
are
consumed
for
illuminating
purposes
the
absolute
necessity
for
special
ventilation
gave
rise
to
the
sun
burner
with
its
ventilating
shaft
this
however
gives
but
a
very
poor
illuminating
power
per
cubic
foot
of
gas
consumed
due
partly
to
the
cooling
of
the
flame
by
the
current
of
air
produced
and
partly
to
its
distance
from
the
objects
to
be
illuminated
the
great
difficulty
which
in
the
whole
history
of
ventilation
has
opposed
itself
to
the
adoption
of
proper
arrangements
for
removing
the
products
of
combustion
has
been
the
necessity
of
bringing
the
tube
to
carry
off
the
gases
low
down
into
the
room
and
of
incasing
the
burner
in
such
a
way
that
none
of
the
products
should
escape
but
with
the
present
revolution
in
gas
burners
this
necessity
is
entirely
done
away
with
and
the
regenerative
burner
offers
the
means
not
only
of
removing
all
the
products
of
combustion
but
also
of
effecting
thorough
ventilation
of
the
room
itself
as
experiments
made
some
few
years
ago
showed
me
that
a
ventilating
regenerative
burner
burning
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
hour
and
properly
fitted
will
not
only
remove
all
its
own
products
of
combustion
but
also
over
cubic
feet
per
hour
of
the
vitiated
air
from
the
upper
part
of
the
room
i
am
quite
aware
that
many
regenerative
lamp
makers
raise
various
objections
to
fitting
ventilating
lamps
these
being
chiefly
due
to
the
fact
that
it
requires
considerable
trouble
to
fit
them
properly
but
i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
show
the
absolute
necessity
of
some
such
system
and
when
there
is
a
general
demand
for
ventilating
lamps
engineering
skill
will
soon
find
means
to
overcome
any
slight
difficulties
which
exist
having
disposed
in
a
few
words
of
a
subject
which
if
fully
treated
would
occupy
a
long
course
of
lectures
by
itself
i
will
pass
on
to
the
consideration
of
gas
as
at
present
used
as
a
fuel
there
is
no
doubt
that
gas
is
the
most
convenient
and
in
many
ways
one
of
the
best
forms
of
fuel
for
heating
and
cooking
purposes
and
the
efforts
which
all
large
gas
companies
are
now
making
to
popularize
and
increase
the
use
of
gas
for
such
purposes
will
undoubtedly
bear
fruit
in
the
future
but
before
the
day
can
come
for
gas
to
be
used
in
this
way
on
a
large
scale
there
is
one
fact
which
the
gas
manager
and
gas
stove
manufacturer
must
clearly
realize
and
submit
to
and
that
is
that
no
gas
stove
or
gas
water
heater
of
any
construction
should
be
sent
out
or
fitted
without
just
as
great
care
being
taken
to
provide
for
the
carrying
away
of
the
products
of
combustion
as
if
an
ordinary
fuel
range
was
being
fitted
do
not
for
one
moment
allow
yourself
to
be
persuaded
that
because
a
gas
stove
or
geyser
does
not
send
out
a
mass
of
black
smoke
the
products
of
combustion
can
be
neglected
and
with
safety
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
atmosphere
we
are
to
breathe
scarcely
a
winter
passes
but
one
or
more
deaths
are
recorded
from
the
products
of
combustion
given
off
from
various
forms
of
water
heaters
used
in
bath
rooms
scarcely
a
cookery
class
is
given
with
gas
stoves
that
one
or
more
ladies
do
not
have
to
leave
suffering
from
an
intense
headache
and
often
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
and
the
same
cause
which
brings
about
these
extreme
cases
on
a
smaller
scale
causes
such
physical
discomfort
to
many
delicately
organized
persons
that
a
large
class
exist
who
absolutely
and
resolutely
decline
to
have
gas
as
an
illuminant
or
fuel
in
any
of
their
living
rooms
and
if
the
use
of
gas
more
especially
as
fuel
is
to
be
extended
and
if
gas
is
to
hold
its
own
in
the
future
against
such
rivals
as
the
electric
light
then
those
interested
in
gas
and
gas
stoves
must
face
the
problem
and
by
improving
the
methods
of
burning
and
using
gas
do
away
with
the
present
serious
drawbacks
which
exist
to
its
use
the
feeling
has
gradually
been
gaining
ground
in
the
public
mind
that
when
atmospheric
burners
and
other
devices
for
burning
coal
gas
are
employed
for
heating
purposes
certain
deleterious
products
of
incomplete
combustion
find
their
way
into
the
air
and
that
this
takes
place
to
a
considerable
extent
is
shown
by
the
facts
brought
forward
in
a
paper
read
by
william
thomson
before
the
last
meeting
of
the
british
association
thomson
attempted
to
separate
and
determine
the
quantity
of
carbon
monoxide
and
hydrocarbons
present
in
the
flue
gases
from
various
forms
of
gas
stoves
and
burners
but
like
every
other
observer
who
has
attempted
to
solve
this
most
difficult
problem
he
found
it
so
beset
with
difficulties
that
he
had
to
abandon
it
and
contented
himself
with
determining
the
total
amounts
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
escaping
in
an
unburned
condition
experiments
which
showed
that
the
combustion
of
gas
in
stoves
for
heating
purposes
is
much
more
incomplete
than
one
had
been
in
the
habit
of
supposing
but
his
experiments
give
no
clew
as
to
whether
the
incompletely
burned
matter
consisted
of
such
deleterious
gases
as
carbon
monoxide
and
acetylene
or
comparatively
harmless
gases
such
as
marsh
gas
and
hydrogen
after
considerable
work
upon
the
subject
i
have
succeeded
in
doing
this
by
a
very
delicate
process
of
analysis
and
i
now
wish
to
lay
some
of
my
results
before
you
if
a
cold
substance
metal
or
be
placed
in
a
flame
whether
it
be
luminous
or
it
will
be
observed
that
there
is
a
clear
space
in
which
no
combustion
is
taking
place
formed
round
the
cool
surface
and
that
as
the
body
gets
heated
so
this
space
gets
less
and
less
until
when
the
substance
is
at
the
same
temperature
as
the
flame
itself
there
is
contact
between
the
two
moreover
when
a
luminous
flame
is
employed
in
this
experiment
the
space
still
exists
between
the
cool
body
and
the
flame
but
you
also
notice
that
the
luminosity
is
decreased
over
a
still
larger
area
although
the
flame
exists
this
meaning
that
in
immediate
contact
with
the
cold
body
the
temperature
is
so
reduced
that
the
flame
can
not
exist
and
so
is
extinguished
over
a
small
area
while
over
a
still
larger
space
the
temperature
is
so
reduced
that
it
is
not
hot
enough
to
bring
about
decomposition
of
the
heavy
hydrocarbons
with
liberation
of
carbon
to
the
same
extent
as
in
hotter
portions
of
the
flame
now
inasmuch
as
when
water
is
heated
or
boiled
in
an
open
vessel
the
temperature
can
not
rise
above
and
as
the
temperature
of
an
ordinary
flame
is
over
it
is
evident
that
the
burning
gas
can
never
be
in
contact
with
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
or
in
other
words
the
gas
is
put
out
before
combustion
is
completed
and
the
unburned
gas
and
products
of
incomplete
combustion
find
their
way
into
the
air
and
render
it
perfectly
unfit
for
respiration
the
portion
of
the
flame
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
hottest
is
about
half
an
inch
above
the
tip
of
the
inner
zone
of
the
flame
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
most
vessels
containing
water
to
be
heated
are
made
to
impinge
on
the
flame
and
it
is
this
portion
of
the
flame
also
which
is
utilized
for
raising
various
solids
to
a
temperature
at
which
they
radiate
heat
in
order
to
gain
an
insight
into
the
amount
of
contamination
which
the
air
undergoes
when
a
geyser
or
cooking
stove
is
at
work
i
have
determined
the
composition
of
the
products
of
combustion
and
the
unburned
gases
escaping
when
a
vessel
containing
water
at
the
ordinary
temperatures
is
heated
up
to
the
boiling
point
by
a
gas
flame
the
vessel
being
placed
in
the
first
case
half
an
inch
above
the
inner
cone
of
the
flame
and
in
the
second
at
the
extreme
outer
tip
of
the
flame

these
figures
are
of
the
greatest
interest
as
they
show
conclusively
that
the
extreme
top
of
the
bunsen
flame
is
the
only
portion
of
the
flame
which
can
be
used
for
heating
a
solid
substance
without
liberating
deleterious
gases
and
this
corroborates
the
previous
experiment
on
the
gases
in
the
outer
zone
of
a
flame
which
showed
that
the
outer
zone
of
a
bunsen
flame
is
the
only
place
where
complete
combustion
is
approached
moreover
this
sets
at
rest
a
question
which
has
been
over
and
over
again
under
discussion
and
that
is
whether
it
is
better
to
use
a
luminous
or
a
flame
for
heating
purposes
using
a
luminous
flame
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
a
deposit
of
carbon
which
is
kept
by
the
flame
at
a
red
heat
on
its
outer
surface
and
the
carbon
dioxide
formed
by
the
complete
combustion
of
the
carbon
already
burned
up
in
flame
is
reduced
by
this
back
to
carbon
monoxide
so
that
even
in
the
extreme
tip
of
a
luminous
flame
it
is
impossible
to
heat
a
cool
body
without
giving
rise
to
carbon
monoxide
although
acetylene
being
absent
gas
stoves
in
which
small
flat
flame
burners
are
used
have
not
that
subtile
and
penetrating
odor
which
marks
the
ordinary
atmospheric
burner
stove
with
the
combustion
checked
just
at
the
right
spot
for
the
formation
of
the
greatest
volume
of
noxious
products
it
is
the
contact
of
the
body
to
be
heated
with
the
flame
before
combustion
is
complete
which
gives
rise
to
the
greatest
mischief
any
cooling
of
the
flame
extinguishes
a
portion
of
the
flame
and
the
gases
present
in
the
flame
at
the
moment
of

surface

of

where

is

taking

without

i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
show
that
no
gas
stove
geyser
or
gas
cooking
stove
should
be
used
without
ample
and
thorough
means
of
ventilation
being
provided
and
no
trace
of
the
products
of
combustion
should
be
allowed
to
escape
into
the
air
until
this
is
done
the
use
of
improper
forms
of
stoves
will
continue
to
inflict
serious
injury
on
the
health
of
the
people
using
them
and
this
will
gradually
result
in
the
abandonment
of
gas
as
a
fuel
instead
of
as
should
be
the
case
its
coming
into
general
use
the
english
householder
is
far
too
prone
to
accept
what
is
offered
to
him
without
using
his
own
common
sense
and
will
buy
the
article
which
tickles
his
eye
the
most
and
his
pocket
the
least
on
the
bare
assurance
of
the
shopkeeper
who
is
only
anxious
to
sell
but
when
he
finds
that
health
and
comfort
are
in
jeopardy
and
has
discarded
the
gas
stove
it
will
take
years
of
labor
to
convince
him
that
it
was
the
misuse
of
gas
which
caused
the
trouble
already
signs
are
not
wanting
that
the
employers
of
gas
stoves
are
beginning
to
fight
shy
of
them
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
the
gas
managers
of
the
kingdom
will
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
stove
manufacturers
to
give
proper
attention
to
this
all
important
question
so
strongly
do
i
feel
the
importance
of
this
question
to
the
gas
world
and
the
public
that
i
freely
offer
to
analyze
the
products
of
combustion
given
off
by
any
gas
stove
or
water
heater
sent
to
me
at
greenwich
during
the
next
six
months
on
one
condition
and
that
is
that
the
results
good
bad
or
indifferent
will
be
published
in
a
paper
before
this
society
which
has
always
been
in
the
front
when
matters
of
great
sanitary
importance
to
the
public
had
to
be
taken
up
and
if
after
that
the
public
like
to
buy
forms
of
apparatus
which
have
not
been
certified
it
is
their
own
fault
but
i
do
think
that
the
maker
of
any
stove
or
geyser
which
causes
a
death
should
be
put
upon
his
trial
for
manslaughter
in
conclusion
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
what
is
likely
to
be
the
future
of
gas
during
the
next
half
century
the
labor
troubles
bad
as
they
are
and
have
been
will
not
cease
for
many
a
weary
year
the
victims
of
imperfect
education
more
dangerous
than
none
at
all
as
while
destroying
natural
instinct
it
leaves
nothing
in
its
place
will
still
listen
and
be
led
by
the
baneful
influence
of
irresponsible
demagogues
who
care
for
naught
so
long
as
they
can
read
their
own
inflammatory
utterances
in
the
local
press
and
gain
a
temporary
notoriety
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
fools
whose
cause
they
profess
to
serve
the
natural
tendency
of
this
will
be
that
every
contrivance
that
can
will
be
pressed
into
the
gas
manager
service
and
that
although
coal
of
a
poorer
class
than
at
present
used
will
still
be
employed
as
a
source
of
gas
the
present
retort
setting
will
quickly
give
way
to
inclined
retorts
on
the
coze
principle
while
instead
of
the
present
wasteful
method
of
quenching
the
red
hot
coke
it
will
be
shot
direct
into
the
generator
of
the
water
gas
plant
and
the
water
gas
carbureted
with
the
benzene
hydrocarbons
derived
from
the
smoke
of
the
blast
furnace
and
coke
oven
or
from
the
creosote
oil
of
the
tar
distiller
by
the
process
foreshadowed
in
the
concluding
sentences
of
my
last
lecture
it
will
then
be
mixed
with
the
gas
from
the
retorts
and
will
supply
a
far
higher
illuminant
than
we
at
present
possess
in
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
such
as
south
wales
where
gas
coal
is
dear
and
anthracite
and
bastard
coals
are
cheap
water
gas
highly
carbureted
will
entirely
supplant
coal
gas
with
a
saving
of
fifty
per
cent
on
the
prices
now
existing
in
those
districts
while
these
changes
have
been
going
on
and
while
improved
methods
of
manufacture
have
been
tending
to
the
cheapening
of
gas
it
will
have
been
steadily
growing
in
public
favor
as
a
fuel
and
if
in
years
to
come
the
generation
of
electricity
should
have
been
so
cheapened
as
to
allow
it
to
successfully
compete
with
gas
as
an
illuminant
the
gas
works
will
still
be
found
as
busy
as
of
yore
the
holder
of
gas
shares
as
contented
as
for
with
a
desire
for
a
purer
atmosphere
and
a
white
mist
instead
of
a
yellow
fog
gas
will
have
largely
supplanted
coal
as
a
fuel
and
gas
stoves
properly
ventilated
and
free
from
the
reproaches
i
have
hurled
at
them
will
burn
a
gas
far
higher
in
its
heating
power
far
better
in
its
power
of
bearing
illuminating
hydrocarbons
and
free
from
poisonous
constituents
when
the
demand
for
it
arises
hydrogen
gas
can
be
made
as
cheaply
as
water
gas
itself
and
when
time
is
ripe
for
a
fuel
gas
for
use
in
the
house
it
is
hydrogen
and
not
water
gas
which
will
form
its
basis
with
carbureted
water
gas
and
per
cent
of
carbon
monoxide
we
are
still
below
the
limit
of
danger
but
a
pure
water
gas
with
over
per
cent
of
the
same
insidious
element
of
danger
will
never
be
tolerated
in
our
households
already
a
patent
has
been
taken
by
crookes
and
for
purifying
water
gas
from
carbon
monoxide
and
converting
it
mainly
into
hydrogen
by
passing
it
at
a
high
temperature
through
a
mixture
of
lime
and
soda
lime
a
process
which
is
chemically
perfect
as
the
most
expensive
portion
of
the
material
used
could
be
recovered
but
in
the
present
state
of
the
labor
market
it
is
not
practical
as
for
the
making
of
every
cubic
feet
of
gas
fifteen
tons
of
material
would
have
to
be
handled
the
cost
of
labor
alone
being
sufficient
to
prevent
its
being
adopted
moreover
hydrogen
can
be
made
far
cheaper
directly
from
the
earliest
days
of
gas
making
the
manufacture
of
hydrogen
by
the
passage
of
steam
over
iron
has
been
over
and
over
again
mooted
and
attempted
on
a
large
scale
but
several
factors
have
combined
to
render
it
futile
in
the
first
place
for
every
cubic
feet
of
hydrogen
made
under
perfect
theoretical
conditions
never
likely
to
be
obtained
in
practice
lb
of
iron
were
converted
into
the
magnetic
oxide
and
as
there
was
no
ready
sale
for
this
article
this
alone
would
prevent
its
being
used
as
a
cheap
source
of
hydrogen
the
next
point
was
that
when
steam
was
passed
over
the
iron
the
temperature
was
so
rapidly
lowered
that
the
generation
of
gas
could
only
go
on
for
a
very
short
period
while
finally
the
swelling
of
the
mass
in
the
retort
and
fusion
of
some
of
the
magnetic
oxide
into
the
side
renders
the
removal
of
the
spent
material
almost
an
impossibility
these
difficulties
can
however
be
got
over
take
a
fire
clay
retort
six
feet
long
and
a
foot
in
diameter
and
cap
it
with
a
casting
bearing
two
outlet
tubes
closed
by
screw
valves
while
a
similar
tube
leads
from
the
bottom
of
the
retort
inclose
this
retort
by
a
furnace
chamber
of
iron
lined
with
fire
brick
leaving
a
space
of
two
feet
six
inches
round
the
retort
and
connect
the
top
of
the
furnace
chamber
with
one
opening
at
the
top
of
the
upright
retort
while
air
blasts
lead
into
the
bottom
of
the
furnace
chamber
below
rocking
fire
bars
which
start
at
bottom
of
the
retort
and
slope
upward
to
leave
room
for
ash
holes
closed
by
gas
tight
covers
the
retort
is
filled
with
iron
or
steel
borings
alone
if
pure
hydrogen
is
required
or
cast
into
balls
with
pitch
if
a
little
carbon
monoxide
is
not
a
drawback
as
in
foundry
work
the
furnace
chamber
is
now
filled
with
coke
fed
in
through
manholes
or
hoppers
in
the
top
and
the
fuel
being
ignited
the
blast
is
turned
on
and
the
mixture
of
nitrogen
and
carbon
monoxide
passes
over
the
iron
heating
it
to
a
red
heat
while
the
fuel
in
contact
with
the
retort
does
the
same
thing
when
the
fuel
and
retort
full
of
iron
are
at
a
heat
the
air
blast
is
cut
off
and
the
pipe
connecting
the
furnace
and
retort
together
with
the
pipe
in
connection
with
the
bottom
of
the
retort
are
closed
and
steam
superheated
by
passing
through
a
pipe
led
round
the
retort
or
interior
wall
of
the
furnace
is
injected
at
the
bottom
of
the
mass
of
iron
which
decomposes
it
forming
magnetic
oxide
of
iron
and
hydrogen
which
escapes
by
the
second
tube
at
the
top
of
the
retort
and
is
led
away
either
to
a
carbureting
chamber
if
required
for
illumination
or
direct
to
the
gasholder
if
wanted
as
a
fuel
the
mass
of
incandescent
fuel
in
the
furnace
chamber
surrounding
the
retort
keeping
up
the
temperature
of
retort
and
iron
sufficiently
long
to
enable
the
decomposition
to
be
completed
the
hydrogen
and
steam
valves
are
now
closed
and
the
air
blast
turned
on
the
hot
carbon
monoxide
passing
over
the
hot
magnetic
oxide
quickly
reduces
it
down
to
metallic
iron
which
being
in
a
spongy
condition
acts
more
freely
on
the
steam
during
later
makes
than
it
did
at
first
and
being
infusible
at
the
temperature
employed
may
be
used
for
a
practically
unlimited
period
what
more
simple
method
than
this
could
be
desired
here
we
have
the
formation
of
the
most
valuable
of
all
fuel
gases
at
the
cost
of
the
coke
and
steam
used
a
gas
also
which
has
double
the
carrying
power
for
hydrocarbon
vapors
possessed
by
coal
gas
while
its
combustion
gives
rise
to
nothing
but
water
vapor
in
this
course
of
lectures
i
have
left
much
unsaid
and
undone
which
i
should
have
liked
to
have
had
time
to
accomplish
and
if
i
have
been
obliged
to
leave
out
of
consideration
many
important
points
it
is
the
time
at
my
disposal
and
not
my
will
which
is
to
blame
and
now
in
conclusion
i
wish
to
express
my
thanks
to
my
assistants
foster
and
warden
who
have
heartily
with
me
in
much
of
the
work
embodied
in
these
lectures
stereoscopic
projections
the
celebrated
philosopher
bacon
the
founder
of
the
experimental
method
claimed
that
we
see
better
with
one
eye
than
with
two
because
the
attention
is
more
concentrated
and
becomes
profounder
on
looking
in
a
mirror
says
he
we
may
observe
that
if
we
shut
one
eye
the
pupil
of
the
other
dilates
to
this
question
but
why
then
have
we
two
eyes
he
responds
in
order
that
one
may
remain
if
the
other
gets
injured
despite
the
reasoning
of
the
learned
philosopher
we
may
be
permitted
to
believe
that
the
reason
that
we
have
two
eyes
is
for
seeing
better
and
especially
for
perceiving
the
effects
of
perspective
and
the
relief
of
objects
we
have
no
intention
of
setting
forth
here
the
theory
of
binocular
vision
one
simple
experiment
will
permit
any
one
to
see
that
the
real
place
of
an
object
is
poorly
estimated
with
one
eye
seated
before
a
desk
pen
in
hand
suddenly
close
one
eye
and
at
the
same
time
stretch
out
the
arm
in
order
to
dip
the
pen
in
the
inkstand
you
will
fail
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
is
not
in
one
day
that
the
effects
of
binocular
vision
have
been
established
for
the
ancients
made
many
observations
on
the
subject
it
was
in
that
the
celebrated
italian
physicist
porta
was
the
first
to
give
an
accurate
figure
of
two
images
seen
by
each
eye
separately
but
he
desired
no
apparatus
that
permitted
of
reconstituting
the
relief
on
looking
at
them
those
savants
who
after
him
occupied
themselves
with
the
question
treated
it
no
further
than
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
it
was
not
till
that
the
english
physicist
wheatstone
constructed
the
first
stereoscopic
apparatus
permitting
of
seeing
the
relief
on
examining
simultaneously
with
each
of
the
eyes
two
different
images
of
an
object
one
having
the
perspective
that
the
right
eye
perceives
and
the
other
that
the
left
eye
perceives
this
apparatus
is
described
in
almost
all
treatises
on
physics
we
may
merely
recall
the
fact
that
it
operated
by
reflection
that
is
to
say
the
two
images
were
seen
through
the
intermedium
of
two
mirrors
making
an
angle
of
degrees
the
instrument
was
very
cumbersome
and
not
very
practical
another
english
physicist
david
brewster
in
devised
the
stereoscope
that
we
all
know
but
what
is
a
curious
thing
he
could
not
succeed
in
having
it
constructed
in
england
where
it
was
not
at
first
appreciated
it
was
not
till
that
he
brought
it
to
paris
where
it
was
constructed
by
soleil
and
his
duboscq
abbot
moigno
and
the
two
celebrated
opticians
succeeded
not
without
some
difficulty
in
having
it
examined
by
the
savants
but
at
the
great
exposition
of
it
was
remarked
by
the
queen
of
england
and
from
this
moment
soleil
duboscq
succeeded
with
difficulty
only
in
satisfying
the
numerous
orders
that
came
from
all
parts
as
photography
permitted
of
easily
making
identical
images
but
with
different
perspective
it
contributed
greatly
to
the
dissemination
of
the
apparatus
the
stereoscope
such
as
we
know
it
presents
the
inconvenience
of
being
incapable
of
being
used
by
but
one
person
at
once
several
inventors
have
endeavored
to
render
the
stereoscopic
images
visible
to
several
spectators
at
the
same
time
in
claudet
conceived
the
idea
of
projecting
the
two
stereoscopic
images
upon
ground
glass
in
superposing
them
the
relief
was
seen
it
appears
but
we
can
not
very
well
explain
why
the
idea
however
had
no
outcome
because
the
image
being
quite
small
could
be
observed
by
but
three
or
four
persons
at
once
it
was
a
french
physicist
who
toward
the
same
epoch
solved
the
problem
in
a
most
admirable
manner
and
we
can
not
explain
why
his
process
that
required
no
special
apparatus
fell
into
the
desuetude
from
which
molteni
has
just
rescued
it
and
obtained
much
success
illustration
stereoscopic
projections
this
is
in
what
it
consists
the
impression
of
the
relief
appears
when
each
eye
sees
that
one
of
the
two
images
which
presents
the
perspective
that
it
would
perceive
if
it
saw
the
real
object
if
we
take
two
transparent
stereoscopic
images
and
place
each
of
them
in
a
projection
lantern
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
be
superposed
upon
the
screen
we
shall
obtain
thereby
a
single
image
it
will
always
be
a
little
light
and
soft
as
the
superposition
can
not
be
effected
accurately
the
perspective
not
being
the
same
for
each
of
them
it
is
a
question
now
to
make
each
eye
see
the
one
of
the
two
images
proper
to
it
to
this
effect
conceived
the
very
ingenious
idea
of
placing
green
glass
in
the
lantern
in
front
of
the
image
having
the
perspective
of
the
right
eye
and
a
red
glass
in
front
of
the
other
image
as
green
and
red
are
complementary
colors
the
result
was
not
changed
upon
the
screen
there
was
a
little
less
light
that
was
all
but
if
at
this
moment
the
spectator
places
a
green
glass
before
his
right
eye
and
a
red
one
before
his
left
he
will
find
himself
in
the
condition
desired
for
realizing
the
effect
sought
each
eye
will
then
see
only
the
image
responding
to
the
coloration
chosen
and
as
it
is
precisely
the
one
which
has
the
perspective
proper
to
it
the
relief
appears
immediately
the
effect
is
striking
we
perceive
a
diffused
image
upon
the
screen
with
the
naked
eye
but
as
soon
as
we
use
one
special
the
relief
appears
with
as
much
distinctness
as
in
the
best
stereoscope
one
must
not
for
example
reverse
his
for
if
things
being
arranged
as
we
have
said
he
looks
through
a
red
glass
before
his
right
eye
and
through
a
green
one
before
his
left
it
is
the
image
carrying
the
perspective
designed
for
the
right
eye
that
will
be
seen
by
the
left
eye
and
reciprocally
there
is
then
produced
especially
with
certain
images
a
very
curious
effect
of
reversed
perspective
the
background
coming
to
the
front
now
that
photography
is
within
every
one
reach
and
that
many
amateurs
are
making
stereopticon
views
and
own
projection
lanterns
we
are
persuaded
that
the
experiment
will
be
much
more
successful
than
it
formerly
was
an
assemblage
of
persons
all
provided
with
colored
is
quite
curious
to
contemplate
our
engraving
represents
a
stereopticon
seance
and
the
draughtsman
has
well
rendered
the
effect
of
the
two
luminous
and
differently
colored
fascicles
superposed
upon
the
screen
in
a
preceding
note
upon
the
same
subject
hospitalier
remarked
that
upon
combining
these
effects
of
perspective
with
those
of
the
praxinoscope
which
give
the
sensation
of
motion
we
would
obtain
entirely
new
effects
it
would
be
perhaps
complicated
as
to
the
installation
and
especially
as
to
the
making
of
the
images
but
in
certain
special
cases
for
giving
the
effect
of
a
machine
in
motion
for
example
it
might
render
genuine
the
effect
on
fowls
of
nitrogenous
and
carbonaceous
rations

this

condensed
by
permission
from
a
thesis
prepared
for
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
science
in
agriculture
by
james
edward
rice
a
graduate
of
the
class
of
the
work
was
planned
and
wholly
carried
out
in
the
most
careful
manner
by
rice
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
the
director
the
results
have
been
thought
worthy
of
publication
in
the
station
on
july
ten
plymouth
rock
hens
one
year
old
and
as
nearly
as
possible
of
uniform
size
were
selected
from
a
flock
of
at
the
same
time
ten
chickens
hatched
from
the
same
hens
mated
with
a
plymouth
rock
cock
were
similarly
chosen
the
chickens
were
about
six
weeks
old
healthy
and
vigorous
and
of
nearly
the
same
size
up
to
the
time
of
purchase
both
hens
and
chickens
had
full
run
of
the
farm
the
hens
foraged
for
themselves
and
were
given
no
food
the
chickens
had
been
fed
corn
meal
dough
sour
milk
and
table
scraps
a
preliminary
feeding
trial
was
continued
for
days
during
which
time
both
hens
and
chickens
were
confined
all
together
in
a
fairly
well
lighted
and
ventilated
room
and
fed
a
great
variety
of
food
in
order
that
all
should
go
into
the
feeding
trial
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
condition
during
this
preliminary
feeding
both
hens
and
chickens
increased
in
live
weight
the
ten
hens
from
a
total
of
lb

and
laid
eggs
the
chickens
from
a
total
of

shells
and
water
were
kept
constantly
before
the
fowls
basins
which
contained
the
food
and

were
kept
within
a
box
constructed
of
lath
so
arranged
that
the
fowls
could
reach
between
the
slats
and
procure
food
and
drink
without
wasting
or
soiling
july
the
hens
and
chickens
were
each
separated
into

which
lasted
days
they
were
fed
and

once
daily
and
an
account
kept
of
the

the

were

from
the

charged
at
the
previous
feeding
the
hens
and
chickens
fed
a

were
given
daily
all
they
would

the
hens
and

fed
a
carbonaceous

were
given
daily
all
they
would
eat
of
a
ration
of
cracked
maize
and
maize
dough
and
will
be
designated
lot
ii
both
groups
were
given
a
small
amount
of
green
clover
as
long
as
it
lasted
and
afterward
cabbage
for
convenience
the
experiment
was
divided
into
five
periods
of
twenty
five
days
food
consumed
and
increase
in
live
weight
during
the
first
period
all
the
fowls
seemed
in
good
health
except
the
carbonaceous
fed
chickens
they
during
this
as
in
all
succeeding
periods
were
restless
and
peevish
always
moping
or
hunting
for
something
to
eat
though
their
trough
was
filled
when
fed
they
would
greedily
take
a
few
mouthfuls
and
then
with
their
hunger
still
unappeased
would
leave
the
dish
they
always
ate
ravenously
the
green
food
which
was
given
them
as
did
the
hens
and
chickens
of
lot
i
the
hens
of
lot
on
the
contrary
seemed
quite
willing
to
squat
about
the
pen
and
subsist
on
the
maize
diet
and
strangely
enough
cared
little
for
green
food
the
clear
maize
diet
was
accompanied
by
such
ill
effects
that
the
chickens
of
each
lot
after
the
first
period
were
given
daily
each
ounce
of
wheat
and
the
hens
each
one
ounce
the
wheat
was
increased
during
the
fourth
and
fifth
periods
in
the
case
of
the
chickens
to
one
ounce
each
during
the
second
period
one
of
the
chickens
fed
nitrogenous
food
and
during
the
third
period
another
of
the
same
lot
were
taken
ill
and
removed
from
the
experiment
both
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
impacted
crops
as
the
stomach
and
gizzard
in
each
case
were
found
to
be
empty
the
fact
that
the
sick
chickens
disliked
the
nitrogenous
ration
and
since
the
first
period
the
amount
of
food
eaten
by
the
hens
and
chickens
of
lot
i
had
continually
decreased
led
to
the
belief
that
their
food
might
be
too
nitrogenous
and
as
during
the
last
days
of
the
third
period
one
of
the
hens
in
lot
i
was
also
ill
it
was
decided
to
discontinue
the
use
of
cotton
seed
meal
and
to
use
linseed
meal
instead
the
hen
recovered
soon
after
the
change
in
food
the
supply
of
skim
milk
running
short
in
the
last
two
periods
water
was
used
instead
in
mixing
the
ration
of
the
lots
fed
nitrogenous
food
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
period
of
the
linseed
meal
in
the
ration
of
lot
i
was
removed
and
cotton
seed
meal
substituted
this
combination
seemed
a
happy
one
for
on
this
ration
both
hens
and
chickens
made
large
gains
at
the
end
of
the
experiment
little
difference
could
be
seen
in
the
hens
of
the
two
groups
but
the
two
lots
of
chickens
were
in
striking
contrast
while
the
chickens
fed
on
nitrogenous
food
were
large
plump
healthy
active
and
well
feathered
the
chickens
fed
on
a
carbonaceous
ration
were
in
general
much
smaller
sickly
and
in
several
cases
almost
destitute
of
feathers
two
of
them
had
perfectly
bare
backs
and
so
ravenous
were
they
for
flesh
and
blood
that
they
began
eating
one
another
the
inability
of
the
chickens
fed
on
a
carbonaceous
diet
to
throw
out
new
feathers
and
the
ability
of
the
chickens
fed
on
a
nitrogenous
diet
to
grow
an
enormous
coat
of
feathers
is
a
splendid
illustration
of
the
effect
of
the
composition
of
the
food
in
supplying
certain
requirements
of
animal
growth
it
was
plain
to
see
that
maize
even
when
assisted
by
a
small
amount
of
wheat
and
green
clover
could
not
supply
sufficient
nitrogen
for
the
growth
of
feathers
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
while
both
lots
of
hens
lost
weight
during
the
experiment
the
loss
was
slightly
greater
with
those
fed
nitrogenous
food
but
these
produced
by
far
the
most
eggs
the
chickens
fed
on
nitrogenous
food
just
about
doubled
in
weight
while
those
fed
carbonaceous
food
only
added
about
to
their
weight
production
of
eggs
during
the
first
week
the
carbonaceous
fed
hens
laid
three
eggs
while
the
others
laid
two
the
two
groups
were
therefore
practically
evenly
divided
at
the
start
as
to
the
condition
of
the
laying
stage
at
the
end
of
the
first
period
the
nitrogenous
fed
hens
had
laid
eggs
and
the
carbonaceous
fed
hens
had
laid
twenty
during
the
next
days
the
former
laid
thirty
and
the
latter
six
during
the
third
period
the
former
laid
six
and
the
latter
not
any
from
this
time
on
no
eggs
were
received
from
either
group
the
decline
in
egg
production
was
probably
due
in
large
part
to
the
fact
that
the
hens
began
to
moult
during
the
second
period
and
continued
to
do
so
during
the
rest
of
the
experiment
the
eggs
laid
by
the
nitrogenous
fed
hens
were
of
small
size
having
a
disagreeable

watery
albumen
an

the

were
in

more
advanced

were
uniformly
small
neither

would
seem
from
these
facts
together
with
the
fact
that
during
the

the
nitrogenous

laid
more
than
three
times
as
many
eggs
that
a

stimulates

herbaceous
grafting
my
attention
has
been
called
a
number
of
times
to
the
unsatisfactory
records
and
directions
concerning
the
grafting
of
herbaceous
plants
there
appears
to
have
been
very
little
attention
given
to
the
subject
and
the
scant
discussions
of
it
are
mostly
copied
from
one
author
to
another
a
few
years
ago
i
made
some
attempts
at
herbaceous
grafting
but
it
was
not
until
last
winter
that
experiments
were
seriously
undertaken
the
work
was
put
in
the
hands
of
lochary
as
a
subject
for
a
graduating
thesis
the
experiments
were
undertaken
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
learning
the
best
methods
of
grafting
herbs
but
a
secondary
and
more
important
object
was
the
study
of
the
reciprocal
influences
of
stock
and
cion
particularly
in
relation
to
variegation
and
coloration
this
second
feature
of
the
work
is
still
under
way
in
one
form
or
another
and
we
hope
for
definite
results
in
a
few
years
as
a
matter
of
immediate
advantage
however
herbaceous
grafting
has
its
uses
particularly
in
securing
different
kinds
of
foliage
and
flowers
upon
the
same
plant
there
is
no
difficulty
in
growing
a
half
dozen
kinds
or
colors
on
geraniums
chrysanthemums
or
other
plants
from
one
stock
of
the
respective
species
six
hundred
grafts
were
made
in
our
trials
last
winter
it
was
found
that
the
wood
must
be
somewhat
hardened
to
secure
best
results
the
very
soft
and
flabby
shoots
are
likely
to
be
injured
in
the
operation
of
grafting
and
union
does
not
take
place
readily
vigorous
coleus
stocks
three
months
old
gave
best
results
if
cut
to
within
two
or
three
inches
of
the
pot
and
all
or
nearly
all
the
leaves
removed
from
the
stump
geraniums
being
harder
in
wood
made
good
unions
at
almost
any
place
except
on
the
soft
growing
points
the
stock
must
not
have
ceased
growth
however
most
of
the
leaves
should
be
kept
down
on
the
stock
cions
an
inch
or
two
long
were
usually
taken
from
firm
growing
tips
in
essentially
the
same
manner
as
in
the
making
of
cuttings
sometimes
an
eye
of
the
old
wood
was
used
and
in
most
cases
union
took
place
and
a
new
shoot
arose
from
the
bud
the
leaves
were
usually
partly
removed
from
the
cion
various
styles
of
grafting
were
employed
of
which
the
common
cleft
and
the
veneer
or
side
graft
were
perhaps
the
most
satisfactory
in
most
instances
it
was
only
necessary
to
bind
the
parts
together
snugly
with
bass
or
raffia
in
some
soft
wooded
plants
like
coleus
a
covering
of
common
grafting
wax
over
the
bandage
was
an
advantage
probably
because
it
prevented
the
drying
out
of
the
parts
in
some
cases
however
wax
injured
the
tissues
where
it
overreached
the
bandage
sphagnum
moss
was
used
in
many
cases
tied
in
a
small
mass
about
the
union
but
unless
the
parts
were
well
bandaged
the
cion
sent
roots
into
the
moss
and
did
not
unite
and
in
no
case
did
moss
appear
to
possess
decided
advantages
best
results
were
obtained
by
placing
the
plants
at
once
in
a
propagating
frame
where
a
damp
and
confined
atmosphere
could
be
obtained
in
some
plants
successful
unions
were
made
in
the
open
greenhouse
but
they
were
placed
in
shade
and
kept
sprinkled
for
a
day
after
the
grafts
were
made
the
operation
should
always
be
performed
quickly
to
prevent
flagging
of
the
cions
or
if
the
cions
can
not
be
used
at
once
they
may
be
thrust
into
sand
or
moss
in
the
same
manner
as
cuttings
and
kept
for
several
days
in
one
series
tomato
and
potato
cuttings
which
had
flagged
in
the
cutting
bed
revived
when
grafted
and
cuttings
which
had
been
transported
in
the
mail
for
three
days
grew
readily
but
they
were
in
good
condition
when
received
the
mealy
bugs
were
particularly
troublesome
upon
these
grafted
plants
for
they
delighted
to
crawl
under
the
bandages
and
suck
the
juices
from
the
wounded
surfaces
although
it
is
foreign
to
the
purpose
of
this
note
it
may
be
worth
while
to
mention
a
few
of
the
plants
upon
which
the
experiments
were
made
sections
were
taken
of
many
of
the
grafts
and
microscopic
examinations
made
to
determine
the
extent
of
cell
union
coleuses
of
many
kinds
were
used
with
uniform
success
and
the
cions
of
some
of
them
were
vigorous
a
year
after
being
set
even
iresine
better
known
as
united
with
coleus
and
grew
for
a
time
zonale
geraniums
bloomed
upon
the
common
rose
geranium
tomatoes
upon
potatoes
and
potatoes
upon
tomatoes
grew
well
and
were
transplanted
to
the
open
ground
where
they
grew
flowered
and
fruited
until
killed
by
frost
the
plants
bore
good
tomatoes
above
and
good
potatoes
beneath
even
though
no
sprouts
from
the
potato
stock
were
allowed
to
grow
peppers
united
with
tomatoes
and
tomatoes
united
with
peppers
egg
plants
tomatoes
and
peppers
grew
upon
the
european
husk
tomato
or
alkekengi
peppers
and
egg
plants
united
with
each
other
reciprocally
a
coleus
cion
was
placed
upon
a
tomato
plant
and
was
simply
bound
with
raffia
the
cion
remained
green
and
healthy
and
at
the
end
of
days
the
bandage
was
removed
but
it
was
found
that
no
union
had
taken
place
ageratums
united
upon
each
other
with
difficulty
chrysanthemums
united
readily
a
bean
plant
bearing
two
partially
grown
beans
chanced
to
grow
in
a
chrysanthemum
pot
the
stem
bearing
the
pods
was
inarched
into
the
chrysanthemum
union
took
place
readily
but
the
beans
turned
yellow
and
died
pumpkin

cucumbers

muskmelons

another
interesting
feature
of
the
work
was
the
grafting
of
one
fruit
upon
another
as
a
tomato
fruit
upon
a
tomato
fruit
or
a
cucumber
upon
