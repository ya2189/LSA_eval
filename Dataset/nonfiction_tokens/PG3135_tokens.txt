summer
in
a
garden
and
calvin
a
study
of
character
by
charles
dudley
warner
introductory
letter
my
dear
fields
i
did
promise
to
write
an
introduction
to
these
charming
papers
but
an
introduction
what
is
it
a
sort
of
pilaster
put
upon
the
face
of
a
building
for
looks
sake
and
usually
flat
very
flat
sometimes
it
may
be
called
a
caryatid
which
is
as
i
understand
it
a
cruel
device
of
architecture
representing
a
man
or
a
woman
obliged
to
hold
up
upon
his
or
her
head
or
shoulders
a
structure
which
they
did
not
build
and
which
could
stand
just
as
well
without
as
with
them
but
an
introduction
is
more
apt
to
be
a
pillar
such
as
one
may
see
in
baalbec
standing
up
in
the
air
all
alone
with
nothing
on
it
and
with
nothing
for
it
to
do
but
an
introductory
letter
is
different
there
is
in
that
no
formality
no
assumption
of
function
no
awkward
propriety
or
dignity
to
be
sustained
a
letter
at
the
opening
of
a
book
may
be
only
a
footpath
leading
the
curious
to
a
favorable
point
of
observation
and
then
leaving
them
to
wander
as
they
will
sluggards
have
been
sent
to
the
ant
for
wisdom
but
writers
might
better
be
sent
to
the
spider
not
because
he
works
all
night
and
watches
all
day
but
because
he
works
unconsciously
he
dare
not
even
bring
his
work
before
his
own
eyes
but
keeps
it
behind
him
as
if
too
much
knowledge
of
what
one
is
doing
would
spoil
the
delicacy
and
modesty
of
one
work
almost
all
graceful
and
fanciful
work
is
born
like
a
dream
that
comes
noiselessly
and
tarries
silently
and
goes
as
a
bubble
bursts
and
yet
somewhere
work
must
come
in
real
work
inness
the
best
american
painter
of
nature
in
her
moods
of
real
human
feeling
once
said
man
can
do
anything
in
art
unless
he
has
intuitions
but
between
whiles
one
must
work
hard
in
collecting
the
materials
out
of
which
intuitions
are
the
truth
could
not
be
hit
off
better
knowledge
is
the
soil
and
intuitions
are
the
flowers
which
grow
up
out
of
it
the
soil
must
be
well
enriched
and
worked
it
is
very
plain
or
will
be
to
those
who
read
these
papers
now
gathered
up
into
this
book
as
into
a
chariot
for
a
race
that
the
author
has
long
employed
his
eyes
his
ears
and
his
understanding
in
observing
and
considering
the
facts
of
nature
and
in
weaving
curious
analogies
being
an
editor
of
one
of
the
oldest
daily
in
new
england
and
obliged
to
fill
its
columns
day
after
day
as
the
village
mill
is
obliged
to
render
every
day
so
many
sacks
of
flour
or
of
meal
to
its
hungry
customers
it
naturally
occurred
to
him
not
write
something
which
i
myself
as
well
as
my
readers
shall
enjoy
the
market
gives
them
facts
enough
politics
lies
enough
art
affectations
enough
criminal
news
horrors
enough
fashion
more
than
enough
of
vanity
upon
vanity
and
vexation
of
purse
why
should
they
not
have
some
of
those
wandering
and
joyous
fancies
which
solace
my
hours
the
suggestion
ripened
into
execution
men
and
women
read
and
wanted
more
these
garden
letters
began
to
blossom
every
week
and
many
hands
were
glad
to
gather
pleasure
from
them
a
sign
it
was
of
wisdom
in
our
feverish
days
it
is
a
sign
of
health
or
of
convalescence
that
men
love
gentle
pleasure
and
enjoyments
that
do
not
rush
or
roar
but
distill
as
the
dew
the
love
of
rural
life
the
habit
of
finding
enjoyment
in
familiar
things
that
susceptibility
to
nature
which
keeps
the
nerve
gently
thrilled
in
her
homliest
nooks
and
by
her
commonest
sounds
is
worth
a
thousand
fortunes
of
money
or
its
equivalents
every
book
which
interprets
the
secret
lore
of
fields
and
gardens
every
essay
that
brings
men
nearer
to
the
understanding
of
the
mysteries
which
every
tree
whispers
every
brook
murmurs
every
weed
even
hints
is
a
contribution
to
the
wealth
and
the
happiness
of
our
kind
and
if
the
lines
of
the
writer
shall
be
traced
in
quaint
characters
and
be
filled
with
a
grave
humor
or
break
out
at
times
into
merriment
all
this
will
be
no
presumption
against
their
wisdom
or
his
goodness
is
the
oak
less
strong
and
tough
because
the
mosses
and
stick
in
all
manner
of
grotesque
sketches
along
its
bark
now
truly
one
may
not
learn
from
this
little
book
either
divinity
or
horticulture
but
if
he
gets
a
pure
happiness
and
a
tendency
to
repeat
the
happiness
from
the
simple
stores
of
nature
he
will
gain
from
our
friend
garden
what
adam
lost
in
his
and
what
neither
philosophy
nor
divinity
has
always
been
able
to
restore
wherefore
thanking
you
for
listening
to
a
former
letter
which
begged
you
to
consider
whether
these
curious
and
ingenious
papers
that
go
winding
about
like
a
path
between
the
garden
and
the
field
might
not
be
given
in
to
your
million
readers
i
remain
yours
to
command
in
everything
but
the
writing
of
an
introduction
henry
ward
beecher
by
way
of
dedication
my
dear
polly
when
a
few
of
these
papers
had
appeared
in
courant
i
was
encouraged
to
continue
them
by
hearing
that
they
had
at
least
one
reader
who
read
them
with
the
serious
mind
from
which
alone
profit
is
to
be
expected
it
was
a
maiden
lady
who
i
am
sure
was
no
more
to
blame
for
her
singleness
than
for
her
age
and
she
looked
to
these
honest
sketches
of
experience
for
that
aid
which
the
professional
agricultural
papers
could
not
give
in
the
management
of
the
little
bit
of
garden
which
she
called
her
own
she
may
have
been
my
only
disciple
and
i
confess
that
the
thought
of
her
yielding
a
simple
faith
to
what
a
gainsaying
world
may
have
regarded
with
levity
has
contributed
much
to
give
an
increased
practical
turn
to
my
reports
of
what
i
know
about
gardening
the
thought
that
i
had
misled
a
lady
whose
age
is
not
her
only
singularity
who
looked
to
me
for
advice
which
should
be
not
at
all
the
fanciful
product
of
the
garden
of
gull
would
give
me
great
pain
i
trust
that
her
autumn
is
a
peaceful
one
and
undisturbed
by
either
the
humorous
or
the
satirical
side
of
nature
you
know
that
this
attempt
to
tell
the
truth
about
one
of
the
most
fascinating
occupations
in
the
world
has
not
been
without
its
dangers
i
have
received
anonymous
letters
some
of
them
were
murderously
spelled
others
were
missives
in
such
elegant
phrase
and
dress
that
danger
was
only
to
be
apprehended
in
them
by
one
skilled
in
the
mysteries
of
medieval
poisoning
when
death
flew
on
the
wings
of
a
perfume
one
lady
whose
entreaty
that
i
should
pause
had
something
of
command
in
it
wrote
that
my
strictures
on
had
so
inflamed
her
husband
zeal
that
in
her
absence
in
the
country
he
had
rooted
up
all
her
beds
of
portulaca
a
sort
of
cousin
of
the
fat
weed
and
utterly
cast
it
out
it
is
however
to
be
expected
that
retributive
justice
would
visit
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
of
an
offending
family
this
is
only
another
proof
of
the
wide
sweep
of
moral
forces
i
suppose
that
it
is
as
necessary
in
the
vegetable
world
as
it
is
elsewhere
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
evil
in
offering
you
the
fruit
of
my
garden
which
has
been
gathered
from
week
to
week
without
much
reference
to
the
progress
of
the
crops
or
the
drought
i
desire
to
acknowledge
an
influence
which
has
lent
half
the
charm
to
my
labor
if
i
were
in
a
court
of
justice
or
injustice
under
oath
i
should
not
like
to
say
that
either
in
the
wooing
days
of
spring
or
under
the
suns
of
the
summer
solstice
you
had
been
either
with
hoe
rake
or
miniature
spade
of
the
least
use
in
the
garden
but
your
suggestions
have
been
invaluable
and
whenever
used
have
been
paid
for
your
horticultural
inquiries
have
been
of
a
nature
to
astonish
the
vegetable
world
if
it
listened
and
were
a
constant
inspiration
to
research
there
was
almost
nothing
that
you
did
not
wish
to
know
and
this
added
to
what
i
wished
to
know
made
a
boundless
field
for
discovery
what
might
have
become
of
the
garden
if
your
advice
had
been
followed
a
good
providence
only
knows
but
i
never
worked
there
without
a
consciousness
that
you
might
at
any
moment
come
down
the
walk
under
the
bestowing
glances
of
approval
that
were
none
the
worse
for
not
being
critical
exercising
a
sort
of
superintendence
that
elevated
gardening
into
a
fine
art
expressing
a
wonder
that
was
as
complimentary
to
me
as
it
was
to
nature
bringing
an
atmosphere
which
made
the
garden
a
region
of
romance
the
soil
of
which
was
set
apart
for
fruits
native
to
climes
unseen
it
was
this
bright
presence
that
filled
the
garden
as
it
did
the
summer
with
light
and
now
leaves
upon
it
that
tender
play
of
color
and
bloom
which
is
called
among
the
alps
the
nook
farm
hartford
october
preliminary
the
love
of
dirt
is
among
the
earliest
of
passions
as
it
is
the
latest
gratify
one
of
our
first
and
best
instincts
so
long
as
we
are
dirty
we
are
pure
fondness
for
the
ground
comes
back
to
a
man
after
he
has
run
the
round
of
pleasure
and
business
eaten
dirt
and
sown
drifted
about
the
world
and
taken
the
wind
of
all
its
moods
the
love
of
digging
in
the
ground
or
of
looking
on
while
he
pays
another
to
dig
is
as
sure
to
come
back
to
him
as
he
is
sure
at
last
to
go
under
the
ground
and
stay
there
to
own
a
bit
of
ground
to
scratch
it
with
a
hoe
to
plant
seeds
and
watch
their
renewal
of
life
this
is
the
commonest
delight
of
the
race
the
most
satisfactory
thing
a
man
can
do
when
cicero
writes
of
the
pleasures
of
old
age
that
of
agriculture
is
chief
among
them
nunc
ad
voluptates
agricolarum
quibus
ego
incredibiliter
delector
quae
nec
ulla
impediuntur
senectute
et
mihi
ad
sapientis
vitam
proxime
videntur
i
am
driven
to
latin
because
new
york
editors
have
exhausted
the
english
language
in
the
praising
of
spring
and
especially
of
the
month
of
may
let
us
celebrate
the
soil
most
men
toil
that
they
may
own
a
piece
of
it
they
measure
their
success
in
life
by
their
ability
to
buy
it
it
is
alike
the
passion
of
the
parvenu
and
the
pride
of
the
aristocrat
broad
acres
are
a
patent
of
nobility
and
no
man
but
feels
more
of
a
man
in
the
world
if
he
have
a
bit
of
ground
that
he
can
call
his
own
however
small
it
is
on
the
surface
it
is
four
thousand
miles
deep
and
that
is
a
very
handsome
property
and
there
is
a
great
pleasure
in
working
in
the
soil
apart
from
the
ownership
of
it
the
man
who
has
planted
a
garden
feels
that
he
has
done
something
for
the
good
of
the
world
he
belongs
to
the
producers
it
is
a
pleasure
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
toil
if
it
be
nothing
more
than
a
head
of
lettuce
or
an
ear
of
corn
one
cultivates
a
lawn
even
with
great
satisfaction
for
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
than
grass
and
turf
in
our
latitude
the
tropics
may
have
their
delights
but
they
have
not
turf
and
the
world
without
turf
is
a
dreary
desert
the
original
garden
of
eden
could
not
have
had
such
turf
as
one
sees
in
england
the
teutonic
races
all
love
turf
they
emigrate
in
the
line
of
its
growth
to
dig
in
the
mellow
dig
moderately
for
all
pleasure
should
be
taken
sparingly
is
a
great
thing
one
gets
strength
out
of
the
ground
as
often
as
one
really
touches
it
with
a
hoe
antaeus
this
is
a
classical
article
was
no
doubt
an
agriculturist
and
such
a
as
hercules
could
do
anything
with
him
till
he
got
him
to
lay
down
his
spade
and
quit
the
soil
it
is
not
simply
beets
and
potatoes
and
corn
and
that
one
raises
in
his
garden
it
is
the
average
of
human
life
there
is
life
in
the
ground
it
goes
into
the
seeds
and
it
also
when
it
is
stirred
up
goes
into
the
man
who
stirs
it
the
hot
sun
on
his
back
as
he
bends
to
his
shovel
and
hoe
or
contemplatively
rakes
the
warm
and
fragrant
loam
is
better
than
much
medicine
the
buds
are
coming
out
on
the
bushes
round
about
the
blossoms
of
the
fruit
trees
begin
to
show
the
blood
is
running
up
the
grapevines
in
streams
you
can
smell
the
wild
flowers
on
the
near
bank
and
the
birds
are
flying
and
glancing
and
singing
everywhere
to
the
open
kitchen
door
comes
the
busy
housewife
to
shake
a
white
something
and
stands
a
moment
to
look
quite
transfixed
by
the
delightful
sights
and
sounds
hoeing
in
the
garden
on
a
bright
soft
may
day
when
you
are
not
obliged
to
is
nearly
equal
to
the
delight
of
going
trouting
blessed
be
agriculture
if
one
does
not
have
too
much
of
it
all
literature
is
fragrant
with
it
in
a
gentlemanly
way
at
the
foot
of
the
charming
hills
of
tivoli
horace
not
he
of
chappaqua
had
a
sunny
farm
it
was
in
sight
of
hadrian
villa
who
did
landscape
gardening
on
an
extensive
scale
and
probably
did
not
get
half
as
much
comfort
out
of
it
as
horace
did
from
his
more
simply
tilled
acres
we
trust
that
horace
did
a
little
hoeing
and
farming
himself
and
that
his
verse
is
not
all
fraudulent
sentiment
in
order
to
enjoy
agriculture
you
do
not
want
too
much
of
it
and
you
want
to
be
poor
enough
to
have
a
little
inducement
to
work
moderately
yourself
hoe
while
it
is
spring
and
enjoy
the
best
anticipations
it
is
not
much
matter
if
things
do
not
turn
out
well
first
week
under
this
modest
title
i
purpose
to
write
a
series
of
papers
some
of
which
will
be
like
many
papers
of
with
nothing
vital
in
them
on
the
subject
of
gardening
holding
that
no
man
has
any
right
to
keep
valuable
knowledge
to
himself
and
hoping
that
those
who
come
after
me
except
and
that
sort
of
person
will
find
profit
in
the
perusal
of
my
experience
as
my
knowledge
is
constantly
increasing
there
is
likely
to
be
no
end
to
these
papers
they
will
pursue
no
orderly
system
of
agriculture
or
horticulture
but
range
from
topic
to
topic
according
to
the
weather
and
the
progress
of
the
weeds
which
may
drive
me
from
one
corner
of
the
garden
to
the
other
the
principal
value
of
a
private
garden
is
not
understood
it
is
not
to
give
the
possessor
vegetables
or
fruit
that
can
be
better
and
cheaper
done
by
the
but
to
teach
him
patience
and
philosophy
and
the
higher
virtues
hope
deferred
and
expectations
blighted
leading
directly
to
resignation
and
sometimes
to
alienation
the
garden
thus
becomes
a
moral
agent
a
test
of
character
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
i
shall
keep
this
central
truth
in
mind
in
these
articles
i
mean
to
have
a
moral
garden
if
it
is
not
a
productive
one
one
that
shall
teach
o
my
brothers
o
my
sisters
the
great
lessons
of
life
the
first
pleasant
thing
about
a
garden
in
this
latitude
is
that
you
never
know
when
to
set
it
going
if
you
want
anything
to
come
to
maturity
early
you
must
start
it
in
a
if
you
put
it
out
early
the
chances
are
all
in
favor
of
getting
it
nipped
with
frost
for
the
thermometer
will
be
deg
one
day
and
go
below
deg
the
night
of
the
day
following
and
if
you
do
not
set
out
plants
or
sow
seeds
early
you
fret
continually
knowing
that
your
vegetables
will
be
late
and
that
while
jones
has
early
peas
you
will
be
watching
your
pods
this
keeps
you
in
a
state
of
mind
when
you
have
planted
anything
early
you
are
doubtful
whether
to
desire
to
see
it
above
ground
or
not
if
a
hot
day
comes
you
long
to
see
the
young
plants
but
when
a
cold
north
wind
brings
frost
you
tremble
lest
the
seeds
have
burst
their
bands
your
spring
is
passed
in
anxious
doubts
and
fears
which
are
usually
realized
and
so
a
great
moral
discipline
is
worked
out
for
you
now
there
is
my
corn
two
or
three
inches
high
this
of
may
and
apparently
having
no
fear
of
a
frost
i
was
hoeing
it
this
morning
for
the
first
time
it
is
not
well
usually
to
hoe
corn
until
about
the
of
may
when
polly
came
out
to
look
at
the
lima
beans
she
seemed
to
think
the
poles
had
come
up
beautifully
i
thought
they
did
look
well
they
are
a
fine
set
of
poles
large
and
well
grown
and
stand
straight
they
were
inexpensive
too
the
cheapness
came
about
from
my
cutting
them
on
another
man
land
and
he
did
not
know
it
i
have
not
examined
this
transaction
in
the
moral
light
of
gardening
but
i
know
people
in
this
country
take
great
liberties
at
the
polls
polly
noticed
that
the
beans
had
not
themselves
come
up
in
any
proper
sense
but
that
the
dirt
had
got
off
from
them
leaving
them
uncovered
she
thought
it
would
be
well
to
sprinkle
a
slight
layer
of
dirt
over
them
and
i
indulgently
consented
it
occurred
to
me
when
she
had
gone
that
beans
always
come
up
that
way
wrong
end
first
and
that
what
they
wanted
was
light
and
not
dirt
woman
always
did
from
the
first
make
a
muss
in
a
garden
i
inherited
with
my
garden
a
large
patch
of
raspberries
splendid
berry
the
raspberry
when
the
strawberry
has
gone
this
patch
has
grown
into
such
a
defiant
attitude
that
you
could
not
get
within
several
feet
of
it
its
stalks
were
enormous
in
size
and
cast
out
long
prickly
arms
in
all
directions
but
the
bushes
were
pretty
much
all
dead
i
have
walked
into
them
a
good
deal
with
a
but
it
is
very
much
like
fighting
original
sin
the
variety
is
one
that
i
can
recommend
i
think
it
is
called
brinckley
orange
it
is
exceedingly
prolific
and
has
enormous
stalks
the
fruit
is
also
said
to
be
good
but
that
does
not
matter
so
much
as
the
plant
does
not
often
bear
in
this
region
the
stalks
seem
to
be
biennial
institutions
and
as
they
get
about
their
growth
one
year
and
bear
the
next
year
and
then
die
and
the
winters
here
nearly
always
kill
them
unless
you
take
them
into
the
house
which
is
inconvenient
if
you
have
a
family
of
small
children
it
is
very
difficult
to
induce
the
plant
to
flower
and
fruit
this
is
the
greatest
objection
there
is
to
this
sort
of
raspberry
i
think
of
keeping
these
for
discipline
and
setting
out
some
others
more
hardy
sorts
for
fruit
second
week
next
to
deciding
when
to
start
your
garden
the
most
important
matter
is
what
to
put
in
it
it
is
difficult
to
decide
what
to
order
for
dinner
on
a
given
day
how
much
more
oppressive
is
it
to
order
in
a
lump
an
endless
vista
of
dinners
so
to
speak
for
unless
your
garden
is
a
boundless
prairie
and
mine
seems
to
me
to
be
that
when
i
hoe
it
on
hot
days
you
must
make
a
selection
from
the
great
variety
of
vegetables
of
those
you
will
raise
in
it
and
you
feel
rather
bound
to
supply
your
own
table
from
your
own
garden
and
to
eat
only
as
you
have
sown
i
hold
that
no
man
has
a
right
whatever
his
sex
of
course
to
have
a
garden
to
his
own
selfish
uses
he
ought
not
to
please
himself
but
every
man
to
please
his
neighbor
i
tried
to
have
a
garden
that
would
give
general
moral
satisfaction
it
seemed
to
me
that
nobody
could
object
to
potatoes
a
most
useful
vegetable
and
i
began
to
plant
them
freely
but
there
was
a
chorus
of
protest
against
them
do
want
to
take
up
your
ground
with
potatoes
the
neighbors
said
can
buy
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
avoid
doing
is
buying
things
you
want
is
the
perishable
things
that
you
can
not
get
fresh
in
the
what
kind
of
perishable
things
a
horticulturist
of
eminence
wanted
me
to
sow
lines
of
and
raspberries
right
over
where
i
had
put
my
potatoes
in
drills
i
had
about
five
hundred
in
another
part
of
my
garden
but
this
wanted
me
to
turn
my
whole
patch
into
vines
and
runners
i
suppose
i
could
raise
strawberries
enough
for
all
my
neighbors
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
do
it
i
had
a
little
space
prepared
for
melons
muskmelons
which
i
showed
to
an
experienced
friend
are
not
going
to
waste
your
ground
on
muskmelons
he
asked
rarely
ripen
in
this
climate
thoroughly
before
he
had
tried
for
years
without
luck
i
resolved
to
not
go
into
such
a
foolish
experiment
but
the
next
day
another
neighbor
happened
in
i
see
you
are
going
to
have
melons
my
family
would
rather
give
up
anything
else
in
the
garden
than
of
the
nutmeg
variety
they
are
the
most
grateful
things
we
have
on
the
so
there
it
was
there
was
no
compromise
it
was
melons
or
no
melons
and
somebody
offended
in
any
case
i
half
resolved
to
plant
them
a
little
late
so
that
they
would
and
they
would
but
i
had
the
same
difficulty
about
which
i
detest
and
squash
which
i
tolerate
and
parsnips
and
the
whole
round
of
green
things
i
have
pretty
much
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
have
got
to
put
your
foot
down
in
gardening
if
i
had
actually
taken
counsel
of
my
friends
i
should
not
have
had
a
thing
growing
in
the
garden
but
weeds
and
besides
while
you
are
waiting
nature
does
not
wait
her
mind
is
made
up
she
knows
just
what
she
will
raise
and
she
has
an
infinite
variety
of
early
and
late
the
most
humiliating
thing
to
me
about
a
garden
is
the
lesson
it
teaches
of
the
inferiority
of
man
nature
is
prompt
decided
inexhaustible
she
thrusts
up
her
plants
with
a
vigor
and
freedom
that
i
admire
and
the
more
worthless
the
plant
the
more
rapid
and
splendid
its
growth
she
is
at
it
early
and
late
and
all
night
never
tiring
nor
showing
the
least
sign
of
exhaustion
gardening
is
the
price
of
liberty
is
a
motto
that
i
should
put
over
the
gateway
of
my
garden
if
i
had
a
gate
and
yet
it
is
not
wholly
true
for
there
is
no
liberty
in
gardening
the
man
who
undertakes
a
garden
is
relentlessly
pursued
he
felicitates
himself
that
when
he
gets
it
once
planted
he
will
have
a
season
of
rest
and
of
enjoyment
in
the
sprouting
and
growing
of
his
seeds
it
is
a
green
anticipation
he
has
planted
a
seed
that
will
keep
him
awake
nights
drive
rest
from
his
bones
and
sleep
from
his
pillow
hardly
is
the
garden
planted
when
he
must
begin
to
hoe
it
the
weeds
have
sprung
up
all
over
it
in
a
night
they
shine
and
wave
in
redundant
life
the
docks
have
almost
gone
to
seed
and
their
roots
go
deeper
than
conscience
talk
about
the
london
docks
the
roots
of
these
are
like
the
sources
of
the
aryan
race
and
the
weeds
are
not
all
i
awake
in
the
morning
and
a
thriving
garden
will
wake
a
person
up
two
hours
before
he
ought
to
be
out
of
bed
and
think
of
the
the
leaves
like
fine
owing
to
black
bugs
that
skip
around
and
ca
be
caught
somebody
ought
to
get
up
before
the
dew
is
off
why
do
the
dew
stay
on
till
after
a
reasonable
breakfast
and
sprinkle
soot
on
the
leaves
i
wonder
if
it
is
soot
is
so
much
blacker
than
the
bugs
that
they
are
disgusted
and
go
away
you
ca
get
up
too
early
if
you
have
a
garden
you
must
be
early
due
yourself
if
you
get
ahead
of
the
bugs
i
think
that
on
the
whole
it
would
be
best
to
sit
up
all
night
and
sleep
daytimes
things
appear
to
go
on
in
the
night
in
the
garden
uncommonly
it
would
be
less
trouble
to
stay
up
than
it
is
to
get
up
so
early
i
have
been
setting
out
some
new
raspberries
two
sorts
a
silver
and
a
gold
color
how
fine
they
will
look
on
the
table
next
year
in
a
dish
the
cream
being
in
a
ditto
pitcher
i
set
them
four
and
five
feet
apart
i
set
my
strawberries
pretty
well
apart
also
the
reason
is
to
give
room
for
the
cows
to
run
through
when
they
break
into
the
garden
as
they
do
sometimes
a
cow
needs
a
broader
track
than
a
locomotive
and
she
generally
makes
one
i
am
sometimes
astonished
to
see
how
big
a
space
in
a
her
foot
will
cover
the
raspberries
are
called
doolittle
and
golden
cap
i
do
like
the
name
of
the
first
variety
and
if
they
do
much
shall
change
it
to
silver
top
you
never
can
tell
what
a
thing
named
doolittle
will
do
the
one
in
the
senate
changed
color
and
got
sour
they
ripen
badly
either
mildew
or
rot
on
the
bush
they
are
apt
to
johnsonize
rot
on
the
stem
i
shall
watch
the
doolittles
third
week
i
believe
that
i
have
found
if
not
original
sin
at
least
vegetable
total
depravity
in
my
garden
and
it
was
there
before
i
went
into
it
it
is
the
bunch
or
joint
or
snakegrass
whatever
it
is
called
as
i
do
not
know
the
names
of
all
the
weeds
and
plants
i
have
to
do
as
adam
did
in
his
garden
name
things
as
i
find
them
this
grass
has
a
slender
beautiful
stalk
and
when
you
cut
it
down
or
pull
up
a
long
root
of
it
you
fancy
it
is
got
rid
of
but
in
a
day
or
two
it
will
come
up
in
the
same
spot
in
half
a
dozen
vigorous
blades
cutting
down
and
pulling
up
is
what
it
thrives
on
extermination
rather
helps
it
if
you
follow
a
slender
white
root
it
will
be
found
to
run
under
the
ground
until
it
meets
another
slender
white
root
and
you
will
soon
unearth
a
network
of
them
with
a
knot
somewhere
sending
out
dozens
of
healthy
shoots
every
joint
prepared
to
be
an
independent
life
and
plant
the
only
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
take
one
part
hoe
and
two
parts
fingers
and
carefully
dig
it
out
not
leaving
a
joint
anywhere
it
will
take
a
little
time
say
all
summer
to
dig
out
thoroughly
a
small
patch
but
if
you
once
dig
it
out
and
keep
it
out
you
will
have
no
further
trouble
i
have
said
it
was
total
depravity
here
it
is
if
you
attempt
to
pull
up
and
root
out
any
sin
in
you
which
shows
on
the
surface
if
it
does
not
show
you
do
not
care
for
it
you
may
have
noticed
how
it
runs
into
an
interior
network
of
sins
and
an
branch
of
them
roots
somewhere
and
that
you
can
not
pull
out
one
without
making
a
general
internal
disturbance
and
rooting
up
your
whole
being
i
suppose
it
is
less
trouble
to
quietly
cut
them
off
at
the
top
say
once
a
week
on
sunday
when
you
put
on
your
religious
clothes
and
face
so
that
no
one
will
see
them
and
not
try
to
eradicate
the
network
within
this
moral
vegetable
figure
is
at
the
service
of
any
clergyman
who
will
have
the
manliness
to
come
forward
and
help
me
at
a
hoeing
on
my
potatoes
none
but
the
orthodox
need
apply
i
however
believe
in
the
intellectual
if
not
the
moral
qualities
of
vegetables
and
especially
weeds
there
was
a
worthless
vine
that
or
who
started
up
about
midway
between
a
and
a
row
of
some
three
feet
from
each
but
a
little
nearer
the
trellis
when
it
came
out
of
the
ground
it
looked
around
to
see
what
it
should
do
the
trellis
was
already
occupied
the
was
empty
there
was
evidently
a
little
the
best
chance
of
light
air
and
sole
proprietorship
on
the
pole
and
the
vine
started
for
the
pole
and
began
to
climb
it
with
determination
here
was
as
distinct
an
act
of
choice
of
reason
as
a
boy
exercises
when
he
goes
into
a
forest
and
looking
about
decides
which
tree
he
will
climb
and
besides
how
did
the
vine
know
enough
to
travel
in
exactly
the
right
direction
three
feet
to
find
what
it
wanted
this
is
intellect
the
weeds
on
the
other
hand
have
hateful
moral
qualities
to
cut
down
a
weed
is
therefore
to
do
a
moral
action
i
feel
as
if
i
were
destroying
sin
my
hoe
becomes
an
instrument
of
retributive
justice
i
am
an
apostle
of
nature
this
view
of
the
matter
lends
a
dignity
to
the
art
of
hoeing
which
nothing
else
does
and
lifts
it
into
the
region
of
ethics
hoeing
becomes
not
a
pastime
but
a
duty
and
you
get
to
regard
it
so
as
the
days
and
the
weeds
lengthen
nevertheless
what
a
man
needs
in
gardening
is
a
back
with
a
hinge
in
it
the
hoe
is
an
ingenious
instrument
calculated
to
call
out
a
great
deal
of
strength
at
a
great
disadvantage
the
striped
bug
has
come
the
saddest
of
the
year
he
is
a
moral
at
that
he
is
unpleasant
in
two
ways
he
burrows
in
the
ground
so
that
you
can
not
find
him
and
he
flies
away
so
that
you
can
not
catch
him
he
is
rather
handsome
as
bugs
go
but
utterly
dastardly
in
that
he
gnaws
the
stem
of
the
plant
close
to
the
ground
and
ruins
it
without
any
apparent
advantage
to
himself
i
find
him
on
the
hills
of
cucumbers
perhaps
it
will
be
a
and
we
shall
not
want
any
the
squashes
small
loss
and
the
melons
which
never
ripen
the
best
way
to
deal
with
the
striped
bug
is
to
sit
down
by
the
hills
and
patiently
watch
for
him
if
you
are
spry
you
can
annoy
him
this
however
takes
time
it
takes
all
day
and
part
of
the
night
for
he
flieth
in
darkness
and
wasteth
at
noonday
if
you
get
up
before
the
dew
is
off
the
plants
it
goes
off
very
early
you
can
sprinkle
soot
on
the
plant
soot
is
my
panacea
if
i
can
get
the
disease
of
a
plant
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
soot
i
am
all
right
and
soot
is
unpleasant
to
the
bug
but
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
set
a
toad
to
catch
the
bugs
the
toad
at
once
establishes
the
most
intimate
relations
with
the
bug
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
such
unity
among
the
lower
animals
the
difficulty
is
to
make
the
toad
stay
and
watch
the
hill
if
you
know
your
toad
it
is
all
right
if
you
do
not
you
must
build
a
tight
fence
round
the
plants
which
the
toad
can
not
jump
over
this
however
introduces
a
new
element
i
find
that
i
have
a
zoological
garden
on
my
hands
it
is
an
unexpected
result
of
my
little
enterprise
which
never
aspired
to
the
completeness
of
the
paris
des
fourth
week
orthodoxy
is
at
a
low
ebb
only
two
clergymen
accepted
my
offer
to
come
and
help
hoe
my
potatoes
for
the
privilege
of
using
my
vegetable
figure
about
the
or
as
some
call
it
and
those
two
did
not
bring
hoes
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
disposition
to
hoe
among
our
educated
clergy
i
am
bound
to
say
that
these
two
however
sat
and
watched
my
vigorous
combats
with
the
weeds
and
talked
most
beautifully
about
the
application
of
the
figure
as
for
instance
when
a
fault
or
sin
showed
on
the
surface
of
a
man
whether
if
you
dug
down
you
would
find
that
it
ran
back
and
into
the
original
organic
bunch
of
original
sin
within
the
man
the
only
other
clergyman
who
came
was
from
out
of
town
a
half
universalist
who
said
he
would
give
twenty
cents
for
my
figure
he
said
that
the
was
not
in
my
garden
originally
that
it
sneaked
in
under
the
sod
and
that
it
could
be
entirely
rooted
out
with
industry
and
patience
i
asked
the
man
to
take
my
hoe
and
try
it
but
he
said
he
had
time
and
went
away
but
jubilate
i
have
got
my
garden
all
hoed
the
first
time
i
feel
as
if
i
had
put
down
the
rebellion
only
there
are
guerrillas
left
here
and
there
about
the
borders
and
in
corners
unsubdued
forrest
docks
and
quantrell
grass
and
beauregard
this
first
hoeing
is
a
gigantic
task
it
is
your
first
trial
of
strength
with
the
forces
of
nature
several
times
in
its
progress
i
was
tempted
to
do
as
adam
did
who
abandoned
his
garden
on
account
of
the
weeds
how
much
my
mind
seems
to
run
upon
adam
as
if
there
had
been
only
two
really
moral
gardens
adam
and
mine
the
only
drawback
to
my
rejoicing
over
the
finishing
of
the
first
hoeing
is
that
the
garden
now
wants
hoeing
the
second
time
i
suppose
if
my
garden
were
planted
in
a
perfect
circle
and
i
started
round
it
with
a
hoe
i
should
never
see
an
opportunity
to
rest
the
fact
is
that
gardening
is
the
old
fable
of
perpetual
labor
and
i
for
one
can
never
forgive
adam
sisyphus
or
whoever
it
was
who
let
in
the
roots
of
discord
i
had
pictured
myself
sitting
at
eve
with
my
family
in
the
shade
of
twilight
contemplating
a
garden
hoed
alas
it
is
a
dream
not
to
be
realized
in
this
world
my
mind
has
been
turned
to
the
subject
of
fruit
and
shade
trees
in
a
garden
there
are
those
who
say
that
trees
shade
the
garden
too
much
and
interfere
with
the
growth
of
the
vegetables
there
may
be
something
in
this
but
when
i
go
down
the
potato
rows
the
rays
of
the
sun
glancing
upon
my
shining
blade
the
sweat
pouring
from
my
face
i
should
be
grateful
for
shade
what
is
a
garden
for
the
pleasure
of
man
i
should
take
much
more
pleasure
in
a
shady
garden
am
i
to
be
sacrificed
broiled
roasted
for
the
sake
of
the
increased
vigor
of
a
few
vegetables
the
thing
is
perfectly
absurd
if
i
were
rich
i
think
i
would
have
my
garden
covered
with
an
awning
so
that
it
would
be
comfortable
to
work
in
it
it
might
roll
up
and
be
removable
as
the
great
awning
of
the
roman
coliseum
was
not
like
the
boston
one
which
went
off
in
a
high
wind
another
very
good
way
to
do
and
probably
not
so
expensive
as
the
awning
would
be
to
have
four
persons
of
foreign
birth
carry
a
sort
of
canopy
over
you
as
you
hoed
and
there
might
be
a
person
at
each
end
of
the
row
with
some
cool
and
refreshing
drink
agriculture
is
still
in
a
very
barbarous
stage
i
hope
to
live
yet
to
see
the
day
when
i
can
do
my
gardening
as
tragedy
is
done
to
slow
and
soothing
music
and
attended
by
some
of
the
comforts
i
have
named
these
things
come
so
forcibly
into
my
mind
sometimes
as
i
work
that
perhaps
when
a
wandering
breeze
lifts
my
straw
hat
or
a
bird
lights
on
a
near
and
shakes
out
a
summer
song
i
almost
expect
to
find
the
cooling
drink
and
the
hospitable
entertainment
at
the
end
of
the
row
but
i
never
do
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
turn
round
and
hoe
back
to
the
other
end
speaking
of
those
yellow
i
think
i
disheartened
them
by
covering
the
plants
so
deep
with
soot
and
that
they
could
not
find
them
and
i
am
in
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
see
the
plants
again
but
i
have
heard
of
another
defense
against
the
bugs
put
a
fine
over
each
hill
which
will
keep
out
the
bugs
and
admit
the
rain
i
should
say
that
these
screens
would
not
cost
much
more
than
the
melons
you
would
be
likely
to
get
from
the
vines
if
you
bought
them
but
then
think
of
the
moral
satisfaction
of
watching
the
bugs
hovering
over
the
screen
seeing
but
unable
to
reach
the
tender
plants
within
that
is
worth
paying
for
i
left
my
own
garden
yesterday
and
went
over
to
where
polly
was
getting
the
weeds
out
of
one
of
her
she
was
working
away
at
the
bed
with
a
little
hoe
whether
women
ought
to
have
the
ballot
or
not
and
i
have
a
decided
opinion
on
that
point
which
i
should
here
plainly
give
did
i
not
fear
that
it
would
injure
my
agricultural
influence
am
compelled
to
say
that
this
was
rather
helpless
hoeing
it
was
patient
conscientious
even
pathetic
hoeing
but
it
was
neither
effective
nor
finished
when
completed
the
bed
looked
somewhat
as
if
a
hen
had
scratched
it
there
was
that
touching
unevenness
about
it
i
think
no
one
could
look
at
it
and
not
be
affected
to
be
sure
polly
smoothed
it
off
with
a
rake
and
asked
me
if
it
was
nice
and
i
said
it
was
it
was
not
a
favorable
time
for
me
to
explain
the
difference
between
puttering
hoeing
and
the
broad
free
sweep
of
the
instrument
which
kills
the
weeds
spares
the
plants
and
loosens
the
soil
without
leaving
it
in
holes
and
hills
but
after
all
as
life
is
constituted
i
think
more
of
polly
honest
and
anxious
care
of
her
plants
than
of
the
most
finished
gardening
in
the
world
fifth
week
i
left
my
garden
for
a
week
just
at
the
close
of
the
dry
spell
a
season
of
rain
immediately
set
in
and
when
i
returned
the
transformation
was
wonderful
in
one
week
every
vegetable
had
fairly
jumped
forward
the
tomatoes
which
i
left
slender
plants
eaten
of
bugs
and
debating
whether
they
would
go
backward
or
forward
had
become
stout
and
lusty
with
thick
stems
and
dark
leaves
and
some
of
them
had
blossomed
the
corn
waved
like
that
which
grows
so
rank
out
of
the
mixture
at
waterloo
the
squashes
i
will
not
speak
of
the
squashes
the
most
remarkable
growth
was
the
asparagus
there
was
not
a
spear
above
ground
when
i
went
away
and
now
it
had
sprung
up
and
gone
to
seed
and
there
were
stalks
higher
than
my
head
i
am
entirely
aware
of
the
value
of
words
and
of
moral
obligations
when
i
say
that
the
asparagus
had
grown
six
feet
in
seven
days
i
expect
and
wish
to
be
believed
i
am
a
little
particular
about
the
statement
for
if
there
is
any
prize
offered
for
asparagus
at
the
next
agricultural
fair
i
wish
to
compete
speed
to
govern
what
i
claim
is
the
fastest
asparagus
as
for
eating
purposes
i
have
seen
better
a
neighbor
of
mine
who
looked
in
at
the
growth
of
the
bed
said
he
be
but
i
told
him
there
was
no
use
of
affirming
now
he
might
keep
his
oath
till
i
wanted
it
on
the
asparagus
affidavit
in
order
to
have
this
sort
of
asparagus
you
want
to
manure
heavily
in
the
early
spring
fork
it
in
and
that
sounds
technical
with
a
thick
layer
of
chloride
of
sodium
if
you
can
not
get
that
common
salt
will
do
and
the
neighbors
will
never
notice
whether
it
is
the
orthodox
na
cl
or
not
i
scarcely
dare
trust
myself
to
speak
of
the
weeds
they
grow
as
if
the
devil
was
in
them
i
know
a
lady
a
member
of
the
church
and
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
considering
the
subject
condition
of
that
class
who
says
that
the
weeds
work
on
her
to
that
extent
that
in
going
through
her
garden
she
has
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
the
ten
commandments
in
anything
like
an
unfractured
condition
i
asked
her
which
one
but
she
said
all
of
them
one
felt
like
breaking
the
whole
lot
the
sort
of
weed
which
i
most
hate
if
i
can
be
said
to
hate
anything
which
grows
in
my
own
garden
is
the
a
fat
spreading
greasy
thing
and
the
most
propagatious
it
is
not
my
fault
if
the
word
is
not
in
the
dictionary
plant
i
know
i
saw
a
chinaman
who
came
over
with
a
returned
missionary
and
pretended
to
be
converted
boil
a
lot
of
it
in
a
pot
stir
in
eggs
and
mix
and
eat
it
with
relish
likee
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
keep
the
chinamen
on
when
they
come
to
do
our
gardening
i
only
fear
they
will
cultivate
it
at
the
expense
of
the
strawberries
and
melons
who
can
say
that
other
weeds
which
we
despise
may
not
be
the
favorite
food
of
some
remote
people
or
tribe
we
ought
to
abate
our
conceit
it
is
possible
that
we
destroy
in
our
gardens
that
which
is
really
of
most
value
in
some
other
place
perhaps
in
like
manner
our
faults
and
vices
are
virtues
in
some
remote
planet
i
can
not
see
however
that
this
thought
is
of
the
slightest
value
to
us
here
any
more
than
weeds
are
there
is
another
subject
which
is
forced
upon
my
notice
i
like
neighbors
and
i
like
chickens
but
i
do
not
think
they
ought
to
be
united
near
a
garden
neighbors
hens
in
your
garden
are
an
annoyance
even
if
they
did
not
scratch
up
the
corn
and
peck
the
strawberries
and
eat
the
tomatoes
it
is
not
pleasant
to
see
them
straddling
about
in
their
jerky
speculative
manner
picking
inquisitively
here
and
there
it
is
of
no
use
to
tell
the
neighbor
that
his
hens
eat
your
tomatoes
it
makes
no
impression
on
him
for
the
tomatoes
are
not
his
the
best
way
is
to
casually
remark
to
him
that
he
has
a
fine
lot
of
chickens
pretty
well
grown
and
that
you
like
spring
chickens
broiled
he
will
take
them
away
at
once
the
neighbors
small
children
are
also
out
of
place
in
your
garden
in
strawberry
and
currant
time
i
hope
i
appreciate
the
value
of
children
we
should
soon
come
to
nothing
without
them
though
the
shakers
have
the
best
gardens
in
the
world
without
them
the
common
school
would
languish
but
the
problem
is
what
to
do
with
them
in
a
garden
for
they
are
not
good
to
eat
and
there
is
a
law
against
making
away
with
them
the
law
is
not
very
well
enforced
it
is
true
for
people
do
thin
them
out
with
constant
dosing
paregoric
and
and
scanty
clothing
but
i
for
one
feel
that
it
would
not
be
right
aside
from
the
law
to
take
the
life
even
of
the
smallest
child
for
the
sake
of
a
little
fruit
more
or
less
in
the
garden
i
may
be
wrong
but
these
are
my
sentiments
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
them
when
we
come
as
bryant
says
in
his
to
leave
the
circus
of
this
life
and
join
that
innumerable
caravan
which
moves
it
will
be
some
satisfaction
to
us
that
we
have
never
in
the
way
of
gardening
disposed
of
even
the
humblest
child
unnecessarily
my
plan
would
be
to
put
them
into
more
thoroughly
and
to
give
the
an
agricultural
turn
teaching
the
children
the
sacredness
of
vegetables
i
think
that
our
do
not
sufficiently
impress
upon
children
the
danger
from
snakes
and
otherwise
of
going
into
the
neighbors
gardens
sixth
week
somebody
has
sent
me
a
new
sort
of
hoe
with
the
wish
that
i
should
speak
favorably
of
it
if
i
can
consistently
i
willingly
do
so
but
with
the
understanding
that
i
am
to
be
at
liberty
to
speak
just
as
courteously
of
any
other
hoe
which
i
may
receive
if
i
understand
religious
morals
this
is
the
position
of
the
religious
press
with
regard
to
bitters
and
in
some
cases
the
responsibility
of
such
a
recommendation
is
shifted
upon
the
wife
of
the
editor
or
polly
says
she
is
entirely
willing
to
make
a
certificate
accompanied
with
an
affidavit
with
regard
to
this
hoe
but
her
habit
of
sitting
about
the
garden
walk
on
an
inverted
while
i
hoe
some
what
destroys
the
practical
value
of
her
testimony
as
to
this
hoe
i
do
not
mind
saying
that
it
has
changed
my
view
of
the
desirableness
and
value
of
human
life
it
has
in
fact
made
life
a
holiday
to
me
it
is
made
on
the
principle
that
man
is
an
upright
sensible
reasonable
being
and
not
a
groveling
wretch
it
does
away
with
the
necessity
of
the
hinge
in
the
back
the
handle
is
seven
and
a
half
feet
long
there
are
two
narrow
blades
sharp
on
both
edges
which
come
together
at
an
obtuse
angle
in
front
and
as
you
walk
along
with
this
hoe
before
you
pushing
and
pulling
with
a
gentle
motion
the
weeds
fall
at
every
thrust
and
withdrawal
and
the
slaughter
is
immediate
and
widespread
when
i
got
this
hoe
i
was
troubled
with
sleepless
mornings
pains
in
the
back
kleptomania
with
regard
to
new
weeders
when
i
went
into
my
garden
i
was
always
sure
to
see
something
in
this
disordered
state
of
mind
and
body
i
got
this
hoe
the
morning
after
a
day
of
using
it
i
slept
perfectly
and
late
i
regained
my
respect
for
the
eighth
commandment
after
two
doses
of
the
hoe
in
the
garden
the
weeds
entirely
disappeared
trying
it
a
third
morning
i
was
obliged
to
throw
it
over
the
fence
in
order
to
save
from
destruction
the
green
things
that
ought
to
grow
in
the
garden
of
course
this
is
figurative
language
what
i
mean
is
that
the
fascination
of
using
this
hoe
is
such
that
you
are
sorely
tempted
to
employ
it
upon
your
vegetables
after
the
weeds
are
laid
low
and
must
hastily
withdraw
it
to
avoid
unpleasant
results
i
make
this
explanation
because
i
intend
to
put
nothing
into
these
agricultural
papers
that
will
not
bear
the
strictest
scientific
investigation
nothing
that
the
youngest
child
can
not
understand
and
cry
for
nothing
that
the
oldest
and
wisest
men
will
not
need
to
study
with
care
i
need
not
add
that
the
care
of
a
garden
with
this
hoe
becomes
the
merest
pastime
i
would
not
be
without
one
for
a
single
night
the
only
danger
is
that
you
may
rather
make
an
idol
of
the
hoe
and
somewhat
neglect
your
garden
in
explaining
it
and
fooling
about
with
it
i
almost
think
that
with
one
of
these
in
the
hands
of
an
ordinary
you
might
see
at
night
where
he
had
been
working
let
us
have
peas
i
have
been
a
zealous
advocate
of
the
birds
i
have
rejoiced
in
their
multiplication
i
have
endured
their
concerts
at
four
in
the
morning
without
a
murmur
let
them
come
i
said
and
eat
the
worms
in
order
that
we
later
may
enjoy
the
foliage
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
we
have
a
cat
a
magnificent
animal
of
the
sex
which
votes
but
not
a
so
large
and
powerful
that
if
he
were
in
the
army
he
would
be
called
long
tom
he
is
a
cat
of
fine
disposition
the
most
irreproachable
morals
i
ever
saw
thrown
away
in
a
cat
and
a
splendid
hunter
he
spends
his
nights
not
in
social
dissipation
but
in
gathering
in
rats
mice
and
also
birds
when
he
first
brought
me
a
bird
i
told
him
that
it
was
wrong
and
tried
to
convince
him
while
he
was
eating
it
that
he
was
doing
wrong
for
he
is
a
reasonable
cat
and
understands
pretty
much
everything
except
the
binomial
theorem
and
the
time
down
the
cycloidal
arc
but
with
no
effect
the
killing
of
birds
went
on
to
my
great
regret
and
shame
the
other
day
i
went
to
my
garden
to
get
a
mess
of
peas
i
had
seen
the
day
before
that
they
were
just
ready
to
pick
how
i
had
lined
the
ground
planted
hoed
bushed
them
the
bushes
were
very
fine
seven
feet
high
and
of
good
wood
how
i
had
delighted
in
the
growing
the
blowing
the
podding
what
a
touching
thought
it
was
that
they
had
all
podded
for
me
when
i
went
to
pick
them
i
found
the
pods
all
split
open
and
the
peas
gone
the
dear
little
birds
who
are
so
fond
of
the
strawberries
had
eaten
them
all
perhaps
there
were
left
as
many
as
i
planted
i
did
not
count
them
i
made
a
rapid
estimate
of
the
cost
of
the
seed
the
interest
of
the
ground
the
price
of
labor
the
value
of
the
bushes
the
anxiety
of
weeks
of
watchfulness
i
looked
about
me
on
the
face
of
nature
the
wind
blew
from
the
south
so
soft
and
treacherous
a
thrush
sang
in
the
woods
so
deceitfully
all
nature
seemed
fair
but
who
was
to
give
me
back
my
peas
the
fowls
of
the
air
have
peas
but
what
has
man
i
went
into
the
house
i
called
calvin
that
is
the
name
of
our
cat
given
him
on
account
of
his
gravity
morality
and
uprightness
we
never
familiarly
call
him
john
i
petted
calvin
i
lavished
upon
him
an
enthusiastic
fondness
i
told
him
that
he
had
no
fault
that
the
one
action
that
i
had
called
a
vice
was
an
heroic
exhibition
of
regard
for
my
interests
i
bade
him
go
and
do
likewise
continually
i
now
saw
how
much
better
instinct
is
than
mere
unguided
reason
calvin
knew
if
he
had
put
his
opinion
into
english
instead
of
his
native
catalogue
it
would
have
been
need
not
teach
your
grandmother
to
suck
it
was
only
the
round
of
nature
the
worms
eat
a
noxious
something
in
the
ground
the
birds
eat
the
worms
calvin
eats
the
birds
we
eat
no
we
do
not
eat
calvin
there
the
chain
stops
when
you
ascend
the
scale
of
being
and
come
to
an
animal
that
is
like
ourselves
inedible
you
have
arrived
at
a
result
where
you
can
rest
let
us
respect
the
cat
he
completes
an
edible
chain
i
have
little
heart
to
discuss
methods
of
raising
peas
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
can
have
an
iron
peabush
a
sort
of
trellis
through
which
i
could
discharge
electricity
at
frequent
intervals
and
electrify
the
birds
to
death
when
they
alight
for
they
stand
upon
my
beautiful
brush
in
order
to
pick
out
the
peas
an
apparatus
of
this
kind
with
an
operator
would
cost
however
about
as
much
as
the
peas
a
neighbor
suggests
that
i
might
put
up
a
scarecrow
near
the
vines
which
would
keep
the
birds
away
i
am
doubtful
about
it
the
birds
are
too
much
accustomed
to
seeing
a
person
in
poor
clothes
in
the
garden
to
care
much
for
that
another
neighbor
suggests
that
the
birds
do
not
open
the
pods
that
a
sort
of
blast
apt
to
come
after
rain
splits
the
pods
and
the
birds
then
eat
the
peas
it
may
be
so
there
seems
to
be
complete
unity
of
action
between
the
blast
and
the
birds
but
good
neighbors
kind
friends
i
desire
that
you
will
not
increase
by
talk
a
disappointment
which
you
can
not
assuage
seventh
week
a
garden
is
an
awful
responsibility
you
never
know
what
you
may
be
aiding
to
grow
in
it
i
heard
a
sermon
not
long
ago
in
which
the
preacher
said
that
the
christian
at
the
moment
of
his
becoming
one
was
as
perfect
a
christian
as
he
would
be
if
he
grew
to
be
an
archangel
that
is
that
he
would
not
change
thereafter
at
all
but
only
develop
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
good
theology
or
not
and
i
hesitate
to
support
it
by
an
illustration
from
my
garden
especially
as
i
do
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
propagating
error
and
i
do
not
care
to
give
away
these
theological
comparisons
to
clergymen
who
make
me
so
little
return
in
the
way
of
labor
but
i
find
in
dissecting
a
that
hidden
in
the
center
of
it
is
a
perfect
miniature
with
the
peas
all
in
it
as
perfect
a
as
it
will
ever
be
only
it
is
as
tiny
as
a
chatelaine
ornament
maize
and
some
other
things
show
the
same
precocity
this
confirmation
of
the
theologic
theory
is
startling
and
sets
me
meditating
upon
the
moral
possibilities
of
my
garden
i
may
find
in
it
yet
the
cosmic
egg
and
speaking
of
moral
things
i
am
half
determined
to
petition
the
ecumenical
council
to
issue
a
bull
of
excommunication
against
of
all
the
forms
which
has
taken
in
this
world
i
think
that
is
about
the
worst
in
the
middle
ages
the
monks
in
bernard
ascetic
community
at
clairvaux
excommunicated
a
vineyard
which
a
less
rigid
monk
had
planted
near
so
that
it
bore
nothing
in
a
bishop
of
laon
excommunicated
the
caterpillars
in
his
diocese
and
the
following
year
bernard
excommunicated
the
flies
in
the
monastery
of
foigny
and
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
pronounced
the
dread
sentence
against
the
rats
of
autun
macon
and
lyons
these
examples
are
sufficient
precedents
it
will
be
well
for
the
council
however
not
to
publish
the
bull
either
just
before
or
just
after
a
rain
for
nothing
can
kill
this
pestilent
heresy
when
the
ground
is
wet
it
is
the
time
of
festivals
polly
says
we
ought
to
have
one
a
she
says
they
are
perfectly
delightful
it
is
so
nice
to
get
people
together
this
hot
weather
they
create
such
a
good
feeling
i
myself
am
very
fond
of
festivals
i
always
go
when
i
can
consistently
besides
the
strawberries
there
are
ice
creams
and
cake
and
lemonade
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
one
always
feels
so
well
the
next
day
after
such
a
diet
but
as
social
reunions
if
there
are
good
things
to
eat
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
and
they
are
very
profitable
if
you
have
a
good
object
i
agreed
that
we
ought
to
have
a
festival
but
i
did
not
know
what
object
to
devote
it
to
we
are
not
in
need
of
an
organ
nor
of
any
i
do
not
know
that
they
use
now
as
much
as
they
used
to
when
preachers
had
to
have
something
soft
to
pound
so
that
they
would
not
hurt
their
fists
i
suggested
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
flannels
for
next
winter
but
polly
says
that
will
not
do
at
all
you
must
have
some
charitable
object
something
that
appeals
to
a
vast
sense
of
something
something
that
it
will
be
right
to
get
up
lotteries
and
that
sort
of
thing
for
i
suggest
a
festival
for
the
benefit
of
my
garden
and
this
seems
feasible
in
order
to
make
everything
pass
off
pleasantly
invited
guests
will
bring
or
send
their
own
strawberries
and
cream
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
sell
to
them
at
a
slight
advance
there
are
a
great
many
improvements
which
the
garden
needs
among
them
a
so
that
the
neighbors
children
can
hear
when
i
tell
them
to
get
a
little
farther
off
from
the
i
should
also
like
a
selection
from
the
ten
commandments
in
big
letters
posted
up
conspicuously
and
a
few
traps
that
will
detain
but
not
maim
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
can
not
read
but
what
is
most
important
is
that
the
ladies
should
crochet
nets
to
cover
over
the
strawberries
a
festival
ought
to
produce
nets
enough
to
cover
my
entire
beds
and
i
can
think
of
no
other
method
of
preserving
the
berries
from
the
birds
next
year
i
wonder
how
many
strawberries
it
would
need
for
a
festival
and
whether
they
would
cost
more
than
the
nets
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
as
the
summer
goes
on
with
the
inequality
of
man
fight
with
nature
especially
in
a
civilized
state
in
savagery
it
does
not
much
matter
for
one
does
not
take
a
square
hold
and
put
out
his
strength
but
rather
accommodates
himself
to
the
situation
and
takes
what
he
can
get
without
raising
any
dust
or
putting
himself
into
everlasting
opposition
but
the
minute
he
begins
to
clear
a
spot
larger
than
he
needs
to
sleep
in
for
a
night
and
to
try
to
have
his
own
way
in
the
least
nature
is
at
once
up
and
vigilant
and
contests
him
at
every
step
with
all
her
ingenuity
and
unwearied
vigor
this
talk
of
subduing
nature
is
pretty
much
nonsense
i
do
not
intend
to
surrender
in
the
midst
of
the
summer
campaign
yet
i
can
not
but
think
how
much
more
peaceful
my
relations
would
now
be
with
the
primal
forces
if
i
had
let
nature
make
the
garden
according
to
her
own
notion
this
is
written
with
the
thermometer
at
ninety
degrees
and
the
weeds
starting
up
with
a
freshness
and
vigor
as
if
they
had
just
thought
of
it
for
the
first
time
and
had
not
been
cut
down
and
dragged
out
every
other
day
since
the
snow
went
off
we
have
got
down
the
forests
and
exterminated
savage
beasts
but
nature
is
no
more
subdued
than
before
she
only
changes
her
tactics
uses
smaller
guns
so
to
speak
she
reenforces
herself
with
a
variety
of
bugs
worms
and
vermin
and
weeds
unknown
to
the
savage
state
in
order
to
make
war
upon
the
things
of
our
planting
and
calls
in
the
fowls
of
the
air
just
as
we
think
the
battle
is
won
to
snatch
away
the
booty
when
one
gets
almost
weary
of
the
struggle
she
is
as
fresh
as
at
the
beginning
just
in
fact
ready
for
the
fray
i
for
my
part
begin
to
appreciate
the
value
of
frost
and
snow
for
they
give
the
husbandman
a
little
peace
and
enable
him
for
a
season
to
contemplate
his
incessant
foe
subdued
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
tropical
people
where
nature
never
goes
to
sleep
give
it
up
and
sit
in
lazy
acquiescence
here
i
have
been
working
all
the
season
to
make
a
piece
of
lawn
it
had
to
be
graded
and
sowed
and
rolled
and
i
have
been
shaving
it
like
a
barber
when
it
was
soft
everything
had
a
tendency
to
go
on
to
it
cows
and
especially
wandering
hackmen
hackmen
who
are
a
product
of
civilization
know
a
lawn
when
they
see
it
they
rather
have
a
fancy
for
it
and
always
try
to
drive
so
as
to
cut
the
sharp
borders
of
it
and
leave
the
marks
of
their
wheels
in
deep
ruts
of
ruined
turf
the
other
morning
i
had
just
been
running
the
mower
over
the
lawn
and
stood
regarding
its
smoothness
when
i
noticed
one
two
three
puffs
of
fresh
earth
in
it
and
hastening
thither
i
found
that
the
mole
had
arrived
to
complete
the
work
of
the
hackmen
in
a
he
had
rooted
up
the
ground
like
a
pig
i
found
his
i
waited
for
him
with
a
spade
he
did
not
appear
but
the
next
time
i
passed
by
he
had
ridged
the
ground
in
all
directions
a
smooth
beautiful
animal
with
fur
like
silk
if
you
could
only
catch
him
he
appears
to
enjoy
the
lawn
as
much
as
the
hackmen
did
he
does
not
care
how
smooth
it
is
he
is
constantly
mining
and
ridging
it
up
i
am
not
sure
but
he
could
be
countermined
i
have
half
a
mind
to
put
powder
in
here
and
there
and
blow
the
whole
thing
into
the
air
some
folks
set
traps
for
the
mole
but
my
moles
never
seem
to
go
twice
in
the
same
place
i
am
not
sure
but
it
would
bother
them
to
sow
the
lawn
with
interlacing
the
botanical
name
of
which
somebody
writes
me
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
the
devil
has
a
botanical
name
which
would
worry
them
if
it
is
as
difficult
for
them
to
get
through
it
as
it
is
for
me
i
do
not
speak
of
this
mole
in
any
tone
of
complaint
he
is
only
a
part
of
the
untiring
resources
which
nature
brings
against
the
humble
gardener
i
desire
to
write
nothing
against
him
which
i
should
wish
to
recall
at
the
last
nothing
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
that
beautiful
saying
of
the
dying
boy
had
no
which
dying
he
was
sorry
he
had
eighth
week
my
garden
has
been
visited
by
a
high
official
person
president
was
here
just
before
the
fourth
getting
his
mind
quiet
for
that
event
by
a
few
days
of
retirement
staying
with
a
friend
at
the
head
of
our
street
and
i
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
come
down
our
way
sunday
afternoon
and
take
a
plain
simple
look
at
my
garden
eat
a
little
lemon
and
and
drink
a
glass
of
native
i
thought
of
putting
up
over
my
gate
to
the
nation
gardener
but
i
hate
nonsense
and
did
do
it
i
however
hoed
diligently
on
saturday
what
weeds
i
could
remove
i
buried
so
that
everything
would
look
all
right
the
borders
of
my
drive
were
trimmed
with
scissors
and
everything
that
could
offend
the
eye
of
the
great
was
hustled
out
of
the
way
in
relating
this
interview
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
not
responsible
for
anything
that
the
president
said
nor
is
he
either
he
is
not
a
great
speaker
but
whatever
he
says
has
an
esoteric
and
an
exoteric
meaning
and
some
of
his
remarks
about
my
vegetables
went
very
deep
i
said
nothing
to
him
whatever
about
politics
at
which
he
seemed
a
good
deal
surprised
he
said
it
was
the
first
garden
he
had
ever
been
in
with
a
man
when
the
talk
was
not
of
appointments
i
told
him
that
this
was
purely
vegetable
after
which
he
seemed
more
at
his
ease
and
in
fact
delighted
with
everything
he
saw
he
was
much
interested
in
my
asked
what
varieties
i
had
and
requested
me
to
send
him
some
seed
he
said
the
seed
was
as
difficult
to
raise
as
an
appropriation
for
the
domingo
business
the
playful
bean
seemed
also
to
please
him
and
he
said
he
had
never
seen
such
impressive
corn
and
potatoes
at
this
time
of
year
that
it
was
to
him
an
unexpected
pleasure
and
one
of
the
choicest
memories
that
he
should
take
away
with
him
of
his
visit
to
new
england
n
that
corn
and
those
potatoes
which
general
looked
at
i
will
sell
for
seed
at
five
dollars
an
ear
and
one
dollar
a
potato
need
not
apply
knowing
the
president
great
desire
for
peas
i
kept
him
from
that
part
of
the
garden
where
the
vines
grow
but
they
could
not
be
concealed
those
who
say
that
the
president
is
not
a
man
easily
moved
are
knaves
or
fools
when
he
saw
my
ravaged
by
the
birds
he
burst
into
tears
a
man
of
war
he
knows
the
value
of
peas
i
told
him
they
were
an
excellent
sort
champion
of
as
quick
as
a
flash
he
said
do
you
call
them
reverdy
johnson
it
was
a
very
clever
but
i
changed
the
subject
the
sight
of
my
squashes
with
stalks
as
big
as
restored
the
president
to
his
usual
spirits
he
said
the
summer
squash
was
the
most
ludicrous
vegetable
he
knew
it
was
nearly
all
leaf
and
blow
with
only
a
sickly
fruit
after
a
mighty
fuss
it
reminded
him
of
the
member
of
congress
from
but
i
hastened
to
change
the
subject
as
we
walked
along
the
keen
eye
of
the
president
rested
upon
some
handsome
sprays
of
which
must
have
grown
up
since
saturday
night
it
was
most
fortunate
for
it
led
his
excellency
to
speak
of
the
chinese
problem
he
said
he
had
been
struck
with
one
coupling
of
the
chinese
and
the
in
one
of
my
agricultural
papers
and
it
had
a
significance
more
than
i
had
probably
supposed
he
had
made
the
chinese
problem
a
special
study
he
said
that
i
was
right
in
saying
that
was
the
natural
food
of
the
chinaman
and
that
where
the
was
there
would
the
chinaman
be
also
for
his
part
he
welcomed
the
chinese
emigration
we
needed
the
chinaman
in
our
gardens
to
eat
the
and
he
thought
the
whole
problem
solved
by
this
simple
consideration
to
get
rid
of
rats
and
he
said
was
a
necessity
of
our
civilization
he
did
not
care
so
much
about
the
he
did
not
think
that
the
little
chinese
shoes
that
he
had
seen
would
be
of
service
in
the
army
but
the
was
quite
another
affair
we
want
to
make
a
garden
of
our
whole
country
the
hoe
in
the
hands
of
a
man
truly
great
he
was
pleased
to
say
was
mightier
than
the
pen
he
presumed
that
general
had
never
taken
into
consideration
the
or
he
would
not
assume
the
position
he
does
with
regard
to
the
chinese
emigration
he
would
let
the
chinese
come
even
if
had
to
leave
i
thought
he
was
going
to
say
but
i
changed
the
subject
during
our
entire
garden
interview
operatically
speaking
the
the
president
was
not
smoking
i
do
not
know
how
the
impression
arose
that
he
tobacco
in
any
form
for
i
have
seen
him
several
times
and
he
was
not
smoking
indeed
i
offered
him
a
connecticut
six
but
he
wittily
said
that
he
did
not
like
a
weed
in
a
garden
a
remark
which
i
took
to
have
a
personal
political
bearing
and
changed
the
subject
the
president
was
a
good
deal
surprised
at
the
method
and
fine
appearance
of
my
garden
and
to
learn
that
i
had
the
sole
care
of
it
he
asked
me
if
i
pursued
an
original
course
or
whether
i
got
my
ideas
from
writers
on
the
subject
i
told
him
that
i
had
had
no
time
to
read
anything
on
the
subject
since
i
began
to
hoe
except
from
which
i
got
my
ideas
of
landscape
gardening
and
that
i
had
worked
the
garden
entirely
according
to
my
own
notions
except
that
i
had
borne
in
mind
his
injunction
fight
it
out
on
this
line
the
president
stopped
me
abruptly
and
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
repeat
that
remark
he
thought
he
had
heard
it
before
indeed
he
deeply
regretted
that
he
had
ever
made
it
sometimes
he
said
after
hearing
it
in
speeches
and
coming
across
it
in
resolutions
and
reading
it
in
newspapers
and
having
it
dropped
jocularly
by
facetious
politicians
who
were
boring
him
for
an
office
about
times
a
day
say
for
a
month
it
would
get
to
running
through
his
head
like
the
song
which
sings
in
the
house
until
it
did
seem
as
if
he
should
go
distracted
he
said
no
man
could
stand
that
kind
of
sentence
hammering
on
his
brain
for
years
the
president
was
so
much
pleased
with
my
management
of
the
garden
that
he
offered
me
at
least
i
so
understood
him
the
position
of
head
gardener
at
the
white
house
to
have
care
of
the
exotics
i
told
him
that
i
thanked
him
but
that
i
did
not
desire
any
foreign
appointment
i
had
resolved
when
the
administration
came
in
not
to
take
an
appointment
and
i
had
kept
my
resolution
as
to
any
home
office
i
was
poor
but
honest
and
of
course
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
take
one
the
president
mused
a
moment
and
then
smiled
and
said
he
would
see
what
could
be
done
for
me
i
did
not
change
the
subject
but
nothing
further
was
said
by
general
the
president
is
a
great
talker
contrary
to
the
general
impression
but
i
think
he
appreciated
his
quiet
hour
in
my
garden
he
said
it
carried
him
back
to
his
youth
farther
than
anything
he
had
seen
lately
he
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
time
when
he
could
again
have
his
private
garden
grow
his
own
lettuce
and
tomatoes
and
not
have
to
get
so
much
from
congress
the
chair
in
which
the
president
sat
while
declining
to
take
a
glass
of
lager
i
have
had
destroyed
in
order
that
no
one
may
sit
in
it
it
was
the
only
way
to
save
it
if
i
may
so
speak
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
keep
it
from
use
by
any
precautions
there
are
people
who
would
have
sat
in
it
if
the
seat
had
been
set
with
iron
spikes
such
is
the
adoration
of
station
ninth
week
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
moral
qualities
of
vegetables
and
contemplate
forming
a
science
which
shall
rank
with
comparative
anatomy
and
comparative
philology
the
science
of
comparative
vegetable
morality
we
live
in
an
age
of
protoplasm
and
if
is
essentially
the
same
in
all
forms
of
life
i
purpose
to
begin
early
and
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
plants
for
which
i
am
responsible
i
will
not
associate
with
any
vegetable
which
is
disreputable
or
has
not
some
quality
that
can
contribute
to
my
moral
growth
i
do
not
care
to
be
seen
much
with
the
squashes
or
the
fortunately
i
can
cut
down
any
sorts
i
do
not
like
with
the
hoe
and
probably
commit
no
more
sin
in
so
doing
than
the
christians
did
in
hewing
down
the
jews
in
the
middle
ages
this
matter
of
vegetable
rank
has
not
been
at
all
studied
as
it
should
be
why
do
we
respect
some
vegetables
and
despise
others
when
all
of
them
come
to
an
equal
honor
or
ignominy
on
the
table
the
bean
is
a
graceful
confiding
engaging
vine
but
you
never
can
put
beans
into
poetry
nor
into
the
highest
sort
of
prose
there
is
no
dignity
in
the
bean
corn
which
in
my
garden
grows
alongside
the
bean
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
with
no
affectation
of
superiority
is
however
the
child
of
song
it
waves
in
all
literature
but
mix
it
with
beans
and
its
high
tone
is
gone
succotash
is
vulgar
it
is
the
bean
in
it
the
bean
is
a
vulgar
vegetable
without
culture
or
any
flavor
of
high
society
among
vegetables
then
there
is
the
cool
cucumber
like
so
many
people
good
for
nothing
when
it
is
ripe
and
the
wildness
has
gone
out
of
it
how
inferior
in
quality
it
is
to
the
melon
which
grows
upon
a
similar
vine
is
of
a
like
watery
consistency
but
is
not
half
so
valuable
the
cucumber
is
a
sort
of
low
comedian
in
a
company
where
the
melon
is
a
minor
gentleman
i
might
also
contrast
the
celery
with
the
potato
the
associations
are
as
opposite
as
the
of
the
duchess
and
the
cabin
of
the
peasant
i
admire
the
potato
both
in
vine
and
blossom
but
it
is
not
aristocratic
i
began
digging
my
potatoes
by
the
way
about
the
of
july
and
i
fancy
i
have
discovered
the
right
way
to
do
it
i
treat
the
potato
just
as
i
would
a
cow
i
do
not
pull
them
up
and
shake
them
out
and
destroy
them
but
i
dig
carefully
at
the
side
of
the
hill
remove
the
fruit
which
is
grown
leaving
the
vine
undisturbed
and
my
theory
is
that
it
will
go
on
bearing
and
submitting
to
my
exactions
until
the
frost
cuts
it
down
it
is
a
game
that
one
would
not
undertake
with
a
vegetable
of
tone
the
lettuce
is
to
me
a
most
interesting
study
lettuce
is
like
conversation
it
must
be
fresh
and
crisp
so
sparkling
that
you
scarcely
notice
the
bitter
in
it
lettuce
like
most
talkers
is
however
apt
to
run
rapidly
to
seed
blessed
is
that
sort
which
comes
to
a
head
and
so
remains
like
a
few
people
i
know
growing
more
solid
and
satisfactory
and
tender
at
the
same
time
and
whiter
at
the
center
and
crisp
in
their
maturity
lettuce
like
conversation
requires
a
good
deal
of
oil
to
avoid
friction
and
keep
the
company
smooth
a
pinch
of
attic
salt
a
dash
of
pepper
a
quantity
of
mustard
and
vinegar
by
all
means
but
so
mixed
that
you
will
notice
no
sharp
contrasts
and
a
trifle
of
sugar
you
can
put
anything
and
the
more
things
the
better
into
salad
as
into
a
conversation
but
everything
depends
upon
the
skill
of
mixing
i
feel
that
i
am
in
the
best
society
when
i
am
with
lettuce
it
is
in
the
select
circle
of
vegetables
the
tomato
appears
well
on
the
table
but
you
do
not
want
to
ask
its
origin
it
is
a
most
agreeable
parvenu
of
course
i
have
said
nothing
about
the
berries
they
live
in
another
and
more
ideal
region
except
perhaps
the
currant
here
we
see
that
even
among
berries
there
are
degrees
of
breeding
the
currant
is
well
enough
clear
as
truth
and
exquisite
in
color
but
i
ask
you
to
notice
how
far
it
is
from
the
exclusive
hauteur
of
the
aristocratic
strawberry
and
the
native
refinement
of
the
quietly
elegant
raspberry
i
do
not
know
that
chemistry
searching
for
protoplasm
is
able
to
discover
the
tendency
of
vegetables
it
can
only
be
found
out
by
outward
observation
i
confess
that
i
am
suspicious
of
the
bean
for
instance
there
are
signs
in
it
of
an
unregulated
life
i
put
up
the
most
attractive
sort
of
poles
for
my
limas
they
stand
high
and
straight
like
in
my
theological
garden
lifted
up
and
some
of
them
have
even
budded
like
aaron
rod
no
in
a
new
england
village
was
ever
better
fitted
to
draw
to
it
the
rising
generation
on
sunday
than
those
poles
to
lift
up
my
beans
towards
heaven
some
of
them
did
run
up
the
sticks
seven
feet
and
then
straggled
off
into
the
air
in
a
wanton
manner
but
more
than
half
of
them
went
gallivanting
off
to
the
neighboring
and
wound
their
tendrils
with
the
tendrils
of
the
grape
with
a
disregard
of
the
proprieties
of
life
which
is
a
satire
upon
human
nature
and
the
grape
is
morally
no
better
i
think
the
ancients
who
were
not
troubled
with
the
recondite
mystery
of
protoplasm
were
right
in
the
mythic
union
of
bacchus
and
venus
talk
about
the
darwinian
theory
of
development
and
the
principle
of
natural
selection
i
should
like
to
see
a
garden
let
to
run
in
accordance
with
it
if
i
had
left
my
vegetables
and
weeds
to
a
free
fight
in
which
the
strongest
specimens
only
should
come
to
maturity
and
the
weaker
go
to
the
wall
i
can
clearly
see
that
i
should
have
had
a
pretty
mess
of
it
it
would
have
been
a
scene
of
passion
and
license
and
brutality
the
would
have
strangled
the
strawberry
the
upright
corn
which
has
now
ears
to
hear
the
guilty
beating
of
the
hearts
of
the
children
who
steal
the
raspberries
would
have
been
dragged
to
the
earth
by
the
wandering
bean
the
would
have
left
no
place
for
the
potatoes
under
ground
and
the
tomatoes
would
have
been
swamped
by
the
lusty
weeds
with
a
firm
hand
i
have
had
to
make
my
own
nothing
will
so
well
bear
watching
as
a
garden
except
a
family
of
children
next
door
their
power
of
selection
beats
mine
if
they
could
read
half
as
well
as
they
can
steal
awhile
away
i
should
put
up
a
notice
beware
there
is
protoplasm
but
i
suppose
it
would
have
no
effect
i
believe
they
would
eat
protoplasm
as
quick
as
anything
else
ripe
or
green
i
wonder
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
considerable
cholera
is
the
only
thing
that
would
let
my
apples
and
pears
ripen
of
course
i
do
not
care
for
the
fruit
but
i
do
not
want
to
take
the
responsibility
of
letting
so
much
full
of
crude
and
even
wicked
tendencies
pass
into
the
composition
of
the
neighbors
children
some
of
whom
may
be
as
immortal
as
there
ought
to
be
a
public
meeting
about
this
and
resolutions
and
perhaps
a
clambake
at
least
it
ought
to
be
put
into
the
catechism
and
put
in
strong
tenth
week
i
think
i
have
discovered
the
way
to
keep
peas
from
the
birds
i
tried
the
scarecrow
plan
in
a
way
which
i
thought
would
outwit
the
shrewdest
bird
the
brain
of
the
bird
is
not
large
but
it
is
all
concentrated
on
one
object
and
that
is
the
attempt
to
elude
the
devices
of
modern
civilization
which
injure
his
chances
of
food
i
knew
that
if
i
put
up
a
complete
stuffed
man
the
bird
would
detect
the
imitation
at
once
the
perfection
of
the
thing
would
show
him
that
it
was
a
trick
people
always
overdo
the
matter
when
they
attempt
deception
i
therefore
hung
some
loose
garments
of
a
bright
color
upon
a
and
set
them
up
among
the
vines
the
supposition
was
that
the
bird
would
think
there
was
an
effort
to
trap
him
that
there
was
a
man
behind
holding
up
these
garments
and
would
sing
as
he
kept
at
a
distance
ca
catch
me
with
any
such
double
the
bird
would
know
or
think
he
knew
that
i
would
not
hang
up
such
a
scare
in
the
expectation
that
it
would
pass
for
a
man
and
deceive
a
bird
and
he
would
therefore
look
for
a
deeper
plot
i
expected
to
outwit
the
bird
by
a
duplicity
that
was
simplicity
itself
i
may
have
the
sagacity
and
reasoning
power
of
the
bird
at
any
rate
i
did
the
amount
of
peas
i
should
gather
but
my
game
was
only
half
played
in
another
part
of
the
garden
were
other
peas
growing
and
blowing
i
took
good
care
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
bird
by
any
scarecrow
whatever
i
left
the
old
scarecrow
conspicuously
flaunting
above
the
old
vines
and
by
this
means
i
hope
to
keep
the
attention
of
the
birds
confined
to
that
side
of
the
garden
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
the
true
use
of
a
scarecrow
it
is
a
lure
and
not
a
warning
if
you
wish
to
save
men
from
any
particular
vice
set
up
a
tremendous
cry
of
warning
about
some
other
and
they
will
all
give
their
special
efforts
to
the
one
to
which
attention
is
called
this
profound
truth
is
about
the
only
thing
i
have
yet
realized
out
of
my
however
the
garden
does
begin
to
yield
i
know
of
nothing
that
makes
one
feel
more
complacent
in
these
july
days
than
to
have
his
vegetables
from
his
own
garden
what
an
effect
it
has
on
the
and
the
butcher
it
is
a
kind
of
declaration
of
independence
the
shows
me
his
peas
and
beets
and
tomatoes
and
supposes
he
shall
send
me
out
some
with
the
meat
i
thank
you
i
say
carelessly
am
raising
my
own
this
whereas
i
have
been
wont
to
remark
vegetables
look
a
little
wilted
this
weather
i
now
say
a
fine
lot
of
vegetables
you
got
when
a
man
is
not
going
to
buy
he
can
afford
to
be
generous
to
raise
his
own
vegetables
makes
a
person
feel
somehow
more
liberal
i
think
the
butcher
is
touched
by
the
influence
and
cuts
off
a
better
roast
for
me
the
butcher
is
my
friend
when
he
sees
that
i
am
not
wholly
dependent
on
him
it
is
at
home
however
that
the
effect
is
most
marked
though
sometimes
in
a
way
that
i
had
not
expected
i
have
never
read
of
any
roman
supper
that
seemed
to
me
equal
to
a
dinner
of
my
own
vegetables
when
everything
on
the
table
is
the
product
of
my
own
labor
except
the
clams
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
raise
yet
and
the
chickens
which
have
withdrawn
from
the
garden
just
when
they
were
most
attractive
it
is
strange
what
a
taste
you
suddenly
have
for
things
you
never
liked
before
the
squash
has
always
been
to
me
a
dish
of
contempt
but
i
eat
it
now
as
if
it
were
my
best
friend
i
never
cared
for
the
beet
or
the
bean
but
i
fancy
now
that
i
could
eat
them
all
tops
and
all
so
completely
have
they
been
transformed
by
the
soil
in
which
they
grew
i
think
the
squash
is
less
squashy
and
the
beet
has
a
deeper
hue
of
rose
for
my
care
of
them
i
had
begun
to
nurse
a
good
deal
of
pride
in
presiding
over
a
table
whereon
was
the
fruit
of
my
honest
industry
but
woman
john
stuart
mill
is
right
when
he
says
that
we
do
not
know
anything
about
women
six
thousand
years
is
as
one
day
with
them
i
thought
i
had
something
to
do
with
those
vegetables
but
when
i
saw
polly
seated
at
her
side
of
the
table
presiding
over
the
new
and
susceptible
vegetables
flanked
by
the
squash
and
the
beans
and
smiling
upon
the
green
corn
and
the
new
potatoes
as
cool
as
the
cucumbers
which
lay
sliced
in
ice
before
her
and
when
she
began
to
dispense
the
fresh
dishes
i
saw
at
once
that
the
day
of
my
destiny
was
over
you
would
have
thought
that
she
owned
all
the
vegetables
and
had
raised
them
all
from
their
earliest
years
such
quiet
vegetable
airs
such
gracious
appropriation
at
length
i
said
do
you
know
who
planted
that
squash
or
those
squashes
i
yes
perhaps
james
did
plant
them
to
a
certain
extent
but
who
hoed
them
did
i
said
in
the
most
sarcastic
manner
and
i
suppose
we
put
on
the
sackcloth
and
ashes
when
the
striped
bug
came
at
four
and
we
watched
the
tender
leaves
and
watered
night
and
morning
the
feeble
plants
tell
you
polly
said
i
uncorking
the
bordeaux
raspberry
vinegar
is
not
a
pea
here
that
does
not
represent
a
drop
of
moisture
wrung
from
my
brow
not
a
beet
that
does
not
stand
for
a
not
a
squash
that
has
not
caused
me
untold
anxiety
and
i
did
hope
but
i
will
say
no
in
this
sort
of
family
discussion
will
say
no
is
the
most
effective
thing
you
can
close
up
with
i
am
not
an
alarmist
i
hope
i
am
as
cool
as
anybody
this
hot
summer
but
i
am
quite
ready
to
say
to
polly
or
any
other
woman
can
have
the
ballot
only
leave
me
the
vegetables
or
what
is
more
important
the
consciousness
of
power
in
i
see
how
it
is
woman
is
now
supreme
in
the
house
she
already
stretches
out
her
hand
to
grasp
the
garden
she
will
gradually
control
everything
woman
is
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
cunning
creatures
who
have
ever
mingled
in
human
affairs
i
understand
those
women
who
say
they
do
want
the
ballot
they
purpose
to
hold
the
real
power
while
we
go
through
the
mockery
of
making
laws
they
want
the
power
without
the
responsibility
suppose
my
squash
had
not
come
up
or
my
beans
as
they
threatened
at
one
time
had
gone
the
wrong
way
where
would
i
have
been
we
are
to
be
held
to
all
the
responsibilities
woman
takes
the
lead
in
all
the
departments
leaving
us
politics
only
and
what
is
politics
let
me
raise
the
vegetables
of
a
nation
says
polly
and
i
care
not
who
makes
its
politics
here
i
sat
at
the
table
armed
with
the
ballot
but
really
powerless
among
my
own
vegetables
while
we
are
being
amused
by
the
ballot
woman
is
quietly
taking
things
into
her
own
hands
eleventh
week
perhaps
after
all
it
is
not
what
you
get
out
of
a
garden
but
what
you
put
into
it
that
is
the
most
remunerative
what
is
a
man
a
question
frequently
asked
and
never
so
far
as
i
know
satisfactorily
answered
he
commonly
spends
his
seventy
years
if
so
many
are
given
him
in
getting
ready
to
enjoy
himself
how
many
hours
how
many
minutes
does
one
get
of
that
pure
content
which
is
happiness
i
do
not
mean
laziness
which
is
always
discontent
but
that
serene
enjoyment
in
which
all
the
natural
senses
have
easy
play
and
the
unnatural
ones
have
a
holiday
there
is
probably
nothing
that
has
such
a
tranquilizing
effect
and
leads
into
such
content
as
gardening
by
gardening
i
do
not
mean
that
insane
desire
to
raise
vegetables
which
some
have
but
the
philosophical
occupation
of
contact
with
the
earth
and
companionship
with
gently
growing
things
and
patient
processes
that
exercise
which
soothes
the
spirit
and
develops
the
deltoid
muscles
in
half
an
hour
i
can
hoe
myself
right
away
from
this
world
as
we
commonly
see
it
into
a
large
place
where
there
are
no
obstacles
what
an
occupation
it
is
for
thought
the
mind
broods
like
a
hen
on
eggs
the
trouble
is
that
you
are
not
thinking
about
anything
but
are
really
vegetating
like
the
plants
around
you
i
begin
to
know
what
the
joy
of
the
is
in
running
up
the
trellis
which
is
similar
to
that
of
the
squirrel
in
running
up
a
tree
we
all
have
something
in
our
nature
that
requires
contact
with
the
earth
in
the
solitude
of
one
gets
into
a
sort
of
communion
with
the
vegetable
life
which
makes
the
old
mythology
possible
for
instance
i
can
believe
that
the
dryads
are
plenty
this
summer
my
garden
is
like
an
almost
all
the
moisture
it
has
had
in
weeks
has
been
the
sweat
of
honest
industry
the
pleasure
of
gardening
in
these
days
when
the
thermometer
is
at
ninety
is
one
that
i
fear
i
shall
not
be
able
to
make
intelligible
to
my
readers
many
of
whom
do
not
appreciate
the
delight
of
soaking
in
the
sunshine
i
suppose
that
the
sun
going
through
a
man
as
it
will
on
such
a
day
takes
out
of
him
rheumatism
consumption
and
every
other
disease
except
sudden
death
from
but
aside
from
this
there
is
an
odor
from
the
evergreens
the
hedges
the
various
plants
and
vines
that
is
only
expressed
and
set
afloat
at
a
high
temperature
which
is
delicious
and
hot
as
it
may
be
a
little
breeze
will
come
at
intervals
which
can
be
heard
in
the
treetops
and
which
is
an
unobtrusive
benediction
i
hear
a
quail
or
two
whistling
in
the
ravine
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
fragmentary
conversation
going
on
among
the
birds
even
on
the
warmest
days
the
companionship
of
calvin
also
counts
for
a
good
deal
he
usually
attends
me
unless
i
work
too
long
in
one
place
sitting
down
on
the
turf
displaying
the
ermine
of
his
breast
and
watching
my
movements
with
great
intelligence
he
has
a
feline
and
genuine
love
for
the
beauties
of
nature
and
will
establish
himself
where
there
is
a
good
view
and
look
on
it
for
hours
he
always
accompanies
us
when
we
go
to
gather
the
vegetables
seeming
to
be
desirous
to
know
what
we
are
to
have
for
dinner
he
is
a
connoisseur
in
the
garden
being
fond
of
almost
all
the
vegetables
except
the
cucumber
a
dietetic
hint
to
man
i
believe
it
is
also
said
that
the
pig
will
not
eat
tobacco
these
are
important
facts
it
is
singular
however
that
those
who
hold
up
the
pigs
as
models
to
us
never
hold
us
up
as
models
to
the
pigs
i
wish
i
knew
as
much
about
natural
history
and
the
habits
of
animals
as
calvin
does
he
is
the
closest
observer
i
ever
saw
and
there
are
few
species
of
animals
on
the
place
that
he
has
not
analyzed
i
think
he
has
to
use
a
euphemism
very
applicable
to
him
got
outside
of
every
one
of
them
except
the
toad
to
the
toad
he
is
entirely
indifferent
but
i
presume
he
knows
that
the
toad
is
the
most
useful
animal
in
the
garden
i
think
the
agricultural
society
ought
to
offer
a
prize
for
the
finest
toad
when
polly
comes
to
sit
in
the
shade
near
my
to
shell
peas
calvin
is
always
lying
near
in
apparent
obliviousness
but
not
the
slightest
unusual
sound
can
be
made
in
the
bushes
that
he
is
not
alert
and
prepared
to
investigate
the
cause
of
it
it
is
this
habit
of
observation
so
cultivated
which
has
given
him
such
a
trained
mind
and
made
him
so
philosophical
it
is
within
the
capacity
of
even
the
humblest
of
us
to
attain
this
and
speaking
of
the
philosophical
temper
there
is
no
class
of
men
whose
society
is
more
to
be
desired
for
this
quality
than
that
of
plumbers
they
are
the
most
agreeable
men
i
know
and
the
boys
in
the
business
begin
to
be
agreeable
very
early
i
suspect
the
secret
of
it
is
that
they
are
agreeable
by
the
hour
in
the
driest
days
my
fountain
became
disabled
the
pipe
was
stopped
up
a
couple
of
plumbers
with
the
implements
of
their
craft
came
out
to
view
the
situation
there
was
a
good
deal
of
difference
of
opinion
about
where
the
stoppage
was
i
found
the
plumbers
perfectly
willing
to
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
talk
by
the
hour
some
of
their
guesses
and
remarks
were
exceedingly
ingenious
and
their
general
observations
on
other
subjects
were
excellent
in
their
way
and
could
hardly
have
been
better
if
they
had
been
made
by
the
job
the
work
dragged
a
little
as
it
is
apt
to
do
by
the
hour
the
plumbers
had
occasion
to
make
me
several
visits
sometimes
they
would
find
upon
arrival
that
they
had
forgotten
some
indispensable
tool
and
one
would
go
back
to
the
shop
a
mile
and
a
half
after
it
and
his
comrade
would
await
his
return
with
the
most
exemplary
patience
and
sit
down
and
talk
always
by
the
hour
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
a
habit
to
have
something
wanted
at
the
shop
they
seemed
to
me
very
good
workmen
and
always
willing
to
stop
and
talk
about
the
job
or
anything
else
when
i
went
near
them
nor
had
they
any
of
that
impetuous
hurry
that
is
said
to
be
the
bane
of
our
american
civilization
to
their
credit
be
it
said
that
i
never
observed
anything
of
it
in
them
they
can
afford
to
wait
two
of
them
will
sometimes
wait
nearly
half
a
day
while
a
comrade
goes
for
a
tool
they
are
patient
and
philosophical
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
meet
such
men
one
only
wishes
there
was
some
work
he
could
do
for
them
by
the
hour
there
ought
to
be
reciprocity
i
think
they
have
very
nearly
solved
the
problem
of
life
it
is
to
work
for
other
people
never
for
yourself
and
get
your
pay
by
the
hour
you
then
have
no
anxiety
and
little
work
if
you
do
things
by
the
job
you
are
perpetually
driven
the
hours
are
scourges
if
you
work
by
the
hour
you
gently
sail
on
the
stream
of
time
which
is
always
bearing
you
on
to
the
haven
of
pay
whether
you
make
any
effort
or
not
working
by
the
hour
tends
to
make
one
moral
a
plumber
working
by
the
job
trying
to
unscrew
a
rusty
refractory
nut
in
a
cramped
position
where
the
tongs
continually
slipped
off
would
swear
but
i
never
heard
one
of
them
swear
or
exhibit
the
least
impatience
at
such
a
vexation
working
by
the
hour
nothing
can
move
a
man
who
is
paid
by
the
hour
how
sweet
the
flight
of
time
seems
to
his
calm
mind
twelfth
week
horace
greeley
the
introduction
of
whose
name
confers
an
honor
upon
this
page
although
i
ought
to
say
that
it
is
used
entirely
without
his
consent
is
my
sole
authority
in
agriculture
in
politics
i
do
not
dare
to
follow
him
but
in
agriculture
he
is
irresistible
when
therefore
i
find
him
advising
western
farmers
not
to
hill
up
their
corn
i
think
that
his
advice
must
be
political
you
must
hill
up
your
corn
people
always
have
hilled
up
their
corn
it
would
take
a
constitutional
amendment
to
change
the
practice
that
has
pertained
ever
since
maize
was
raised
will
stand
the
drought
better
says
greeley
the
ground
is
left
i
have
corn
in
my
garden
ten
and
twelve
feet
high
strong
and
lusty
standing
the
drought
like
a
grenadier
and
it
is
hilled
in
advising
this
radical
change
greeley
evidently
has
a
political
purpose
he
might
just
as
well
say
that
you
should
not
hill
beans
when
everybody
knows
that
a
of
is
one
of
the
most
expressive
symbols
of
disparagement
when
i
become
too
lazy
to
hill
my
corn
i
too
shall
go
into
politics
i
am
satisfied
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
cultivate
i
set
a
little
of
it
one
side
and
gave
it
some
extra
care
it
did
not
thrive
as
well
as
that
which
i
was
fighting
the
fact
is
there
is
a
spirit
of
moral
perversity
in
the
plant
which
makes
it
grow
the
more
the
more
it
is
interfered
with
i
am
satisfied
of
that
i
doubt
if
any
one
has
raised
more
this
year
than
i
have
and
my
warfare
with
it
has
been
continual
neither
of
us
has
slept
much
if
you
combat
it
it
will
grow
to
use
an
expression
that
will
be
understood
by
many
like
the
devil
i
have
a
neighbor
a
good
christian
man
benevolent
and
a
person
of
good
judgment
he
planted
next
to
me
an
acre
of
turnips
recently
a
few
days
after
he
went
to
look
at
his
crop
and
he
found
the
entire
ground
covered
with
a
thick
and
luxurious
carpet
of
with
a
worked
in
here
and
there
as
an
ornament
i
have
seldom
seen
so
thrifty
a
field
i
advised
my
neighbor
next
time
to
sow
and
then
he
might
get
a
few
turnips
i
wish
there
was
more
demand
in
our
city
markets
for
as
a
salad
i
can
recommend
it
it
does
not
take
a
great
man
to
soon
discover
that
in
raising
anything
the
greater
part
of
the
plants
goes
into
stalk
and
leaf
and
the
fruit
is
a
most
inconsiderable
portion
i
plant
and
hoe
a
hill
of
corn
it
grows
green
and
stout
and
waves
its
broad
leaves
high
in
the
air
and
is
months
in
perfecting
itself
and
then
yields
us
not
enough
for
a
dinner
it
grows
because
it
delights
to
do
so
to
take
the
juices
out
of
my
ground
to
absorb
my
fertilizers
to
wax
luxuriant
and
disport
itself
in
the
summer
air
and
with
very
little
thought
of
making
any
return
to
me
i
might
go
all
through
my
garden
and
fruit
trees
with
a
similar
result
i
have
heard
of
places
where
there
was
very
little
land
to
the
acre
it
is
universally
true
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
vegetable
show
and
fuss
for
the
result
produced
i
do
not
complain
of
this
one
can
not
expect
vegetables
to
be
better
than
men
and
they
make
a
great
deal
of
ostentatious
splurge
and
many
of
them
come
to
no
result
at
last
usually
the
more
show
of
leaf
and
wood
the
less
fruit
this
melancholy
reflection
is
thrown
in
here
in
order
to
make
seem
cheerful
in
comparison
one
of
the
minor
pleasures
of
life
is
that
of
controlling
vegetable
activity
and
aggressions
with
the
vigorous
and
rapid
growth
is
however
a
necessity
to
the
sport
to
prune
feeble
plants
and
shrubs
is
like
acting
the
part
of
to
a
sickly
orphan
you
must
feel
the
blood
of
nature
bound
under
your
hand
and
get
the
thrill
of
its
life
in
your
nerves
to
control
and
culture
a
strong
thrifty
plant
in
this
way
is
like
steering
a
ship
under
full
headway
or
driving
a
locomotive
with
your
hand
on
the
lever
or
pulling
the
reins
over
a
fast
horse
when
his
blood
and
tail
are
up
i
do
not
understand
by
the
way
the
pleasure
of
the
jockey
in
setting
up
the
tail
of
the
horse
artificially
if
i
had
a
horse
with
a
tail
not
able
to
sit
up
i
should
feed
the
horse
and
curry
him
into
good
spirits
and
let
him
set
up
his
own
tail
when
i
see
a
poor
spiritless
horse
going
by
with
an
artificially
tail
it
is
only
a
signal
of
distress
i
desire
to
be
surrounded
only
by
healthy
vigorous
plants
and
trees
which
require
constant
and
management
merely
to
cut
away
dead
branches
is
like
perpetual
attendance
at
a
funeral
and
puts
one
in
low
spirits
i
want
to
have
a
garden
and
orchard
rise
up
and
meet
me
every
morning
with
the
request
to
on
i
respect
old
age
but
an
old
hoary
with
mossy
bark
is
a
melancholy
spectacle
i
suppose
the
time
has
come
when
i
am
expected
to
say
something
about
fertilizers
all
agriculturists
do
when
you
plant
you
think
you
can
not
fertilize
too
much
when
you
get
the
bills
for
the
manure
you
think
you
can
not
fertilize
too
little
of
course
you
do
not
expect
to
get
the
value
of
the
manure
back
in
fruits
and
vegetables
but
something
is
due
to
science
to
chemistry
in
particular
you
must
have
a
knowledge
of
soils
must
have
your
soil
analyzed
and
then
go
into
a
course
of
experiments
to
find
what
it
needs
it
needs
analyzing
that
i
am
clear
about
everything
needs
that
you
had
better
have
the
soil
analyzed
before
you
buy
if
there
is
in
it
let
it
alone
see
if
it
is
a
soil
that
requires
much
hoeing
and
how
fine
it
will
get
if
there
is
no
rain
for
two
months
but
when
you
come
to
fertilizing
if
i
understand
the
agricultural
authorities
you
open
a
pit
that
will
ultimately
swallow
you
up
farm
and
all
it
is
the
great
subject
of
modern
times
how
to
fertilize
without
ruinous
expense
how
in
short
not
to
starve
the
earth
to
death
while
we
get
our
living
out
of
it
practically
the
business
is
hardly
to
the
taste
of
a
person
of
a
poetic
turn
of
mind
the
details
of
fertilizing
are
not
agreeable
michael
angelo
who
tried
every
art
and
nearly
every
trade
never
gave
his
mind
to
fertilizing
it
is
much
pleasanter
and
easier
to
fertilize
with
a
pen
as
the
agricultural
writers
do
than
with
a
fork
and
this
leads
me
to
say
that
in
carrying
on
a
garden
yourself
you
must
have
a
gardener
that
is
a
man
to
do
the
heavy
and
unpleasant
work
to
such
a
man
i
say
in
language
used
by
demosthenes
to
the
athenians
and
which
is
my
advice
to
all
gardeners
fertilize
fertilize
thirteenth
week
i
find
that
gardening
has
unsurpassed
advantages
for
the
study
of
natural
history
and
some
scientific
facts
have
come
under
my
own
observation
which
can
not
fail
to
interest
naturalists
and
in
about
the
same
degree
much
for
instance
has
been
written
about
the
toad
an
animal
without
which
no
garden
would
be
complete
but
little
account
has
been
made
of
his
value
the
beauty
of
his
eye
alone
has
been
dwelt
on
and
little
has
been
said
of
his
mouth
and
its
important
function
as
a
fly
and
bug
trap
his
habits
and
even
his
origin
have
been
misunderstood
why
as
an
illustration
are
toads
so
plenty
after
a
all
my
life
long
no
one
has
been
able
to
answer
me
that
question
why
after
a
heavy
shower
and
in
the
midst
of
it
do
such
multitudes
of
toads
especially
little
ones
hop
about
on
the
for
many
years
i
believed
that
they
rained
down
and
i
suppose
many
people
think
so
still
they
are
so
small
and
they
come
in
such
numbers
only
in
the
shower
that
the
supposition
is
not
a
violent
one
as
toads
after
a
shower
is
one
of
our
best
proverbs
i
asked
an
explanation
this
of
a
thoughtful
woman
indeed
a
leader
in
the
great
movement
to
have
all
the
toads
hop
in
any
direction
without
any
distinction
of
sex
or
religion
her
reply
was
that
the
toads
come
out
during
the
shower
to
get
water
this
however
is
not
the
fact
i
have
discovered
that
they
come
out
not
to
get
water
i
deluged
a
dry
the
other
night
with
pailful
after
pailful
of
water
instantly
the
toads
came
out
of
their
holes
in
the
dirt
by
tens
and
twenties
and
fifties
to
escape
death
by
drowning
the
big
ones
fled
away
in
a
ridiculous
streak
of
hopping
and
the
little
ones
sprang
about
in
the
wildest
confusion
the
toad
is
just
like
any
other
land
animal
when
his
house
is
full
of
water
he
quits
it
these
facts
with
the
drawings
of
the
water
and
the
toads
are
at
the
service
of
the
distinguished
scientists
of
albany
in
new
york
who
were
so
much
impressed
by
the
cardiff
giant
the
domestic
cow
is
another
animal
whose
ways
i
have
a
chance
to
study
and
also
to
obliterate
in
the
garden
one
of
my
neighbors
has
a
cow
but
no
land
and
he
seems
desirous
to
pasture
her
on
the
surface
of
the
land
of
other
people
a
very
reasonable
desire
the
man
proposed
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
cut
the
grass
from
my
grounds
for
his
cow
i
knew
the
cow
having
often
had
her
in
my
garden
knew
her
gait
and
the
size
of
her
feet
which
struck
me
as
a
little
large
for
the
size
of
the
body
having
no
cow
myself
but
acquaintance
with
my
neighbor
i
told
him
that
i
thought
it
would
be
fair
for
him
to
have
the
grass
he
was
therefore
to
keep
the
grass
nicely
cut
and
to
keep
his
cow
at
home
i
waited
some
time
after
the
grass
needed
cutting
and
as
my
neighbor
did
not
appear
i
hired
it
cut
no
sooner
was
it
done
than
he
promptly
appeared
and
raked
up
most
of
it
and
carried
it
away
he
had
evidently
been
waiting
that
opportunity
when
the
grass
grew
again
the
neighbor
did
not
appear
with
his
scythe
but
one
morning
i
found
the
cow
tethered
on
the
sward
hitched
near
the
a
short
distance
from
the
house
this
seemed
to
be
the
man
idea
of
the
best
way
to
cut
the
grass
i
disliked
to
have
the
cow
there
because
i
knew
her
inclination
to
pull
up
the
stake
and
transfer
her
field
of
mowing
to
the
garden
but
especially
because
of
her
voice
she
has
the
most
melancholy
i
ever
heard
it
is
like
the
wail
of
one
uninfallible
excommunicated
and
lost
it
is
a
most
distressing
perpetual
reminder
of
the
brevity
of
life
and
the
shortness
of
feed
it
is
unpleasant
to
the
family
we
sometimes
hear
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night
breaking
the
silence
like
a
suggestion
of
coming
calamity
it
is
as
bad
as
the
howling
of
a
dog
at
a
funeral
i
told
the
man
about
it
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
cow
voice
i
then
told
him
to
take
her
away
and
he
did
at
intervals
shifting
her
to
different
parts
of
the
grounds
in
my
absence
so
that
the
desolate
voice
would
startle
us
from
unexpected
quarters
if
i
were
to
unhitch
the
cow
and
turn
her
loose
i
knew
where
she
would
go
if
i
were
to
lead
her
away
the
question
was
where
for
i
did
not
fancy
leading
a
cow
about
till
i
could
find
somebody
who
was
willing
to
pasture
her
to
this
dilemma
had
my
excellent
neighbor
reduced
me
but
i
found
him
one
sunday
morning
a
day
when
it
would
not
do
to
get
angry
tying
his
cow
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
beast
all
the
time
going
on
in
that
abominable
voice
i
told
the
man
that
i
could
not
have
the
cow
in
the
grounds
he
said
right
boss
but
he
did
not
go
away
i
asked
him
to
clear
out
the
man
who
is
a
french
sympathizer
from
the
republic
of
ireland
kept
his
temper
perfectly
he
said
he
was
doing
anything
just
feeding
his
cow
a
bit
he
make
me
the
least
trouble
in
the
world
i
reminded
him
that
he
had
been
told
again
and
again
not
to
come
here
that
he
might
have
all
the
grass
but
he
should
not
bring
his
cow
upon
the
premises
the
imperturbable
man
assented
to
everything
that
i
said
and
kept
on
feeding
his
cow
before
i
got
him
to
go
to
fresh
scenes
and
pastures
new
the
sabbath
was
almost
broken
but
it
was
saved
by
one
thing
it
is
difficult
to
be
emphatic
when
no
one
is
emphatic
on
the
other
side
the
man
and
his
cow
have
taught
me
a
great
lesson
which
i
shall
recall
when
i
keep
a
cow
i
can
recommend
this
cow
if
anybody
wants
one
as
a
steady
boarder
whose
keeping
will
cost
the
owner
little
but
if
her
milk
is
at
all
like
her
voice
those
who
drink
it
are
on
the
straight
road
to
lunacy
i
think
i
have
said
that
we
have
a
we
keep
quails
or
try
to
in
the
thickly
wooded
bushed
and
brushed
ravine
this
bird
is
a
great
favorite
with
us
dead
or
alive
on
account
of
its
tasteful
plumage
its
tender
flesh
its
domestic
virtues
and
its
pleasant
piping
besides
although
i
appreciate
toads
and
cows
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
like
to
have
a
more
in
the
english
style
and
we
did
for
in
july
while
the
was
on
and
the
young
quails
were
coming
on
we
were
awakened
one
morning
by
firing
close
at
hand
my
first
thought
was
that
war
was
declared
but
as
i
should
never
pay
much
attention
to
war
declared
at
that
time
in
the
morning
i
went
to
sleep
again
but
the
occurrence
was
repeated
and
not
only
early
in
the
morning
but
at
night
there
was
calling
of
dogs
breaking
down
of
brush
and
firing
of
guns
it
is
hardly
pleasant
to
have
guns
fired
in
the
direction
of
the
house
at
your
own
quails
the
hunters
could
be
sometimes
seen
but
never
caught
their
best
time
was
about
sunrise
but
before
one
could
dress
and
get
to
the
front
they
would
retire
one
morning
about
four
i
heard
the
battle
renewed
i
sprang
up
but
not
in
arms
and
went
to
a
window
polly
like
another
damozel
flew
to
another
window
blessed
damozel
leaned
out
from
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
and
reconnoitered
from
behind
the
blinds
wonder
was
not
yet
quite
gone
from
that
still
look
of
hers
when
an
armed
man
and
a
legged
dog
appeared
in
the
opening
i
was
vigilantly
watching
him
now
she
spoke
through
the
still
you
afraid
to
speak
to
him
asked
polly
not
exactly
spoke
as
when
the
stars
sang
in
their
spheres
by
this
inquiry
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
till
bar
i
leaned
on
was
warm
and
cried
there
what
are
you
doing
out
he
do
shoot
you
called
out
polly
from
the
other
window
suddenly
going
on
another
tack
i
explained
that
a
sportsman
would
not
be
likely
to
shoot
a
gentleman
in
his
own
house
with
so
long
as
quails
were
to
be
had
have
no
business
here
what
are
you
after
i
repeated
for
a
lost
hen
said
the
man
as
he
strode
away
the
reply
was
so
satisfactory
and
conclusive
that
i
shut
the
blinds
and
went
to
bed
but
one
evening
i
overhauled
one
of
the
poachers
hearing
his
dog
in
the
thicket
i
rushed
through
the
brush
and
came
in
sight
of
the
hunter
as
he
was
retreating
down
the
road
he
came
to
a
halt
and
we
had
some
conversation
in
a
high
key
of
course
i
threatened
to
prosecute
him
i
believe
that
is
the
thing
to
do
in
such
cases
but
how
i
was
to
do
it
when
i
did
not
know
his
name
or
ancestry
and
could
see
his
face
never
occurred
to
me
i
remember
now
that
a
farmer
once
proposed
to
prosecute
me
when
i
was
fishing
in
a
on
his
farm
and
asked
my
name
for
that
purpose
he
said
he
should
smile
to
see
me
prosecute
him
ca
do
it
there
ai
no
notice
up
about
this
view
of
the
common
law
impressed
me
and
i
said
these
are
private
h
was
all
his
response
you
ca
argue
much
with
a
man
who
has
a
gun
in
his
hands
when
you
have
none
besides
it
might
be
a
for
aught
i
knew
i
gave
it
up
and
we
separated
there
is
this
disadvantage
about
having
a
game
preserve
attached
to
your
garden
it
makes
life
too
lively
fourteenth
week
in
these
golden
latter
august
days
nature
has
come
to
a
serene
equilibrium
having
flowered
and
fruited
she
is
enjoying
herself
i
can
see
how
things
are
going
it
is
a
business
after
this
but
for
the
time
being
it
is
like
swinging
in
a
hammock
such
a
delicious
air
such
a
graceful
repose
i
take
off
my
hat
as
i
stroll
into
the
garden
and
look
about
and
it
does
seem
as
if
nature
had
sounded
a
truce
i
did
ask
for
it
i
went
out
with
a
hoe
but
the
serene
sweetness
disarms
me
thrice
is
he
armed
who
has
a
hoe
with
a
double
blade
yet
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
appear
in
such
a
belligerent
fashion
with
this
terrible
mitrailleuse
of
gardening
the
tomatoes
are
getting
tired
of
ripening
and
are
beginning
to
go
into
a
worthless
condition
green
the
cucumbers
cumber
the
ground
great
yellow
objects
no
more
to
be
compared
to
the
crisp
beauty
of
their
youth
than
is
the
fat
swine
of
the
sty
to
the
clean
little
pig
the
having
covered
themselves
with
delicate
are
now
ready
to
leave
the
vine
i
know
they
are
ripe
if
they
come
easily
off
the
stem
moral
you
can
tell
when
people
are
ripe
by
their
willingness
to
let
go
richness
and
ripeness
are
not
exactly
the
same
the
rich
are
apt
to
hang
to
the
stem
with
tenacity
i
have
nothing
against
the
rich
if
i
were
not
virtuous
i
should
like
to
be
rich
but
we
can
not
have
everything
as
the
man
said
when
he
was
down
with
and
cholera
and
the
yellow
fever
came
into
the
neighborhood
now
the
grapes
soaked
in
this
liquid
gold
called
air
begin
to
turn
mindful
of
the
injunction
turn
or
the
clusters
under
the
leaves
are
getting
quite
purple
but
look
better
than
they
taste
i
think
there
is
no
danger
but
they
will
be
gathered
as
soon
as
they
are
ripe
one
of
the
blessings
of
having
an
open
garden
is
that
i
do
not
have
to
watch
my
fruit
a
dozen
youngsters
do
that
and
let
it
waste
no
time
after
it
matures
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
grow
a
variety
of
grape
like
the
explosive
bullets
that
should
explode
in
the
stomach
the
vine
would
make
such
a
nice
border
for
the
garden
a
masked
battery
of
grape
the
pears
too
are
getting
russet
and
heavy
and
here
and
there
amid
the
shining
leaves
one
gleams
as
ruddy
as
the
cheek
of
the
nutbrown
maid
the
flemish
beauties
come
off
readily
from
the
stem
if
i
take
them
in
my
hand
they
say
all
kinds
of
beauty
come
off
by
handling
the
garden
is
peace
as
much
as
if
it
were
an
empire
even
the
man
cow
lies
down
under
the
tree
where
the
man
has
tied
her
with
such
an
air
of
contentment
that
i
have
small
desire
to
disturb
her
she
is
chewing
my
cud
as
if
it
were
hers
well
eat
on
and
chew
on
melancholy
brute
i
have
not
the
heart
to
tell
the
man
to
take
you
away
and
it
would
do
no
good
if
i
had
he
would
do
it
the
man
has
not
a
taking
way
munch
on
ruminant
creature
the
frost
will
soon
come
the
grass
will
be
brown
i
will
be
charitable
while
this
blessed
lull
continues
for
our
benevolences
must
soon
be
turned
to
other
and
more
distant
objects
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
jews
the
education
of
theological
young
men
in
the
west
and
the
like
i
do
not
know
that
these
appearances
are
deceitful
but
i
sufficiently
know
that
this
is
a
wicked
world
to
be
glad
that
i
have
taken
it
on
shares
in
fact
i
could
not
pick
the
pears
alone
not
to
speak
of
eating
them
when
i
climb
the
trees
and
throw
down
the
dusky
fruit
polly
catches
it
in
her
apron
nearly
always
however
letting
go
when
it
drops
the
fall
is
so
sudden
the
sun
gets
in
her
face
and
every
time
a
pear
comes
down
it
is
a
surprise
like
having
a
tooth
out
she
says
i
could
hold
an
apron
better
than
that
but
the
sentence
is
not
finished
it
is
useless
to
finish
that
sort
of
a
sentence
in
this
delicious
weather
besides
conversation
is
dangerous
as
for
instance
towards
evening
i
am
preparing
a
bed
for
a
sowing
of
turnips
not
that
i
like
turnips
in
the
least
but
this
is
the
season
to
sow
them
polly
comes
out
and
extemporizes
her
usual
seat
to
about
matters
while
i
work
i
well
know
that
something
is
coming
is
a
rotation
of
crops
is
it
i
have
rotated
the
lettuce
off
and
expect
to
rotate
the
turnips
in
it
is
a
political
it
a
shame
that
the
tomatoes
are
all
getting
ripe
at
once
what
a
lot
of
squashes
i
wish
we
had
an
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
any
more
than
i
am
helping
i
thank
i
wonder
what
all
this
is
about
you
think
we
could
sell
some
strawberries
next
year
all
means
sell
anything
we
shall
no
doubt
get
rich
out
of
this
be
and
now
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
and
polly
unfolds
a
small
scheme
of
benevolence
which
is
not
quite
enough
to
break
me
and
is
really
to
be
executed
in
an
economical
manner
that
be
nice
yes
and
where
is
the
money
to
come
from
thought
we
had
agreed
to
sell
the
but
i
think
we
would
make
more
money
if
we
sold
the
plants
said
polly
concluding
the
whole
matter
am
going
to
do
and
having
thus
me
polly
goes
away
and
i
put
in
the
quite
thick
determined
to
raise
enough
to
sell
but
not
even
this
mercenary
thought
can
ruffle
my
mind
as
i
rake
off
the
loamy
bed
i
notice
however
that
the
spring
smell
has
gone
out
of
the
dirt
that
went
into
the
first
crop
in
this
peaceful
unison
with
yielding
nature
i
was
a
little
taken
aback
to
find
that
a
new
enemy
had
turned
up
the
celery
had
just
rubbed
through
the
fiery
scorching
of
the
drought
and
stood
a
faint
chance
to
grow
when
i
noticed
on
the
green
leaves
a
big
worm
called
i
believe
the
but
i
do
know
who
called
him
i
am
sure
i
did
not
it
was
almost
ludicrous
that
he
should
turn
up
here
just
at
the
end
of
the
season
when
i
supposed
that
my
war
with
the
living
animals
was
over
yet
he
was
no
doubt
predestinated
for
he
went
to
work
as
cheerfully
as
if
he
had
arrived
in
june
when
everything
was
fresh
and
vigorous
it
beats
me
nature
does
i
doubt
not
that
if
i
were
to
leave
my
garden
now
for
a
week
it
would
know
me
on
my
return
the
patch
i
scratched
over
for
the
turnips
and
left
as
clean
as
earth
is
already
full
of
ambitious
which
grows
with
all
the
confidence
of
youth
and
the
skill
of
old
age
it
beats
the
serpent
as
an
emblem
of
immortality
while
all
the
others
of
us
in
the
garden
rest
and
sit
in
comfort
a
moment
upon
the
summit
of
the
summer
it
is
as
rampant
and
vicious
as
ever
it
accepts
no
armistice
fifteenth
week
it
is
said
that
absence
conquers
all
things
love
included
but
it
has
a
contrary
effect
on
a
garden
i
was
absent
for
two
or
three
weeks
i
left
my
garden
a
paradise
as
paradises
go
in
this
protoplastic
world
and
when
i
returned
the
trail
of
the
serpent
was
over
it
all
so
to
speak
this
is
in
addition
to
the
actual
snakes
in
it
which
are
large
enough
to
strangle
children
of
average
size
i
asked
polly
if
she
had
seen
to
the
garden
while
i
was
away
and
she
said
she
had
i
found
that
all
the
melons
had
been
seen
to
and
the
early
grapes
and
pears
the
green
worm
had
also
seen
to
about
half
the
celery
and
a
large
flock
of
apparently
perfectly
domesticated
chickens
were
roaming
over
the
ground
gossiping
in
the
hot
september
sun
and
picking
up
any
odd
trifle
that
might
be
left
on
the
whole
the
garden
could
not
have
been
better
seen
to
though
it
would
take
a
sharp
eye
to
see
the
amid
the
rampant
grass
and
weeds
the
new
for
one
thing
had
taken
advantage
of
my
absence
every
one
of
them
had
sent
out
as
many
scarlet
runners
as
an
indian
tribe
has
some
of
them
had
blossomed
and
a
few
had
gone
so
far
as
to
bear
ripe
berries
long
fruit
hanging
like
the
of
an
east
indian
bride
i
could
not
but
admire
the
persistence
of
these
zealous
plants
which
seemed
determined
to
propagate
themselves
both
by
seeds
and
roots
and
make
sure
of
immortality
in
some
way
even
the
colfax
variety
was
as
ambitious
as
the
others
after
having
seen
the
declining
letter
of
colfax
i
did
not
suppose
that
this
vine
would
run
any
more
and
intended
to
root
it
out
but
one
can
never
say
what
these
politicians
mean
and
i
shall
let
this
variety
grow
until
after
the
next
election
at
least
although
i
hear
that
the
fruit
is
small
and
rather
sour
if
there
is
any
variety
of
strawberries
that
really
declines
to
run
and
devotes
itself
to
a
private
life
of
i
should
like
to
get
it
i
may
mention
here
since
we
are
on
politics
that
the
doolittle
raspberries
had
sprawled
all
over
the
so
true
is
it
that
politics
makes
strange
bedfellows
but
another
enemy
had
come
into
the
strawberries
which
after
all
that
has
been
said
in
these
papers
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
but
does
the
preacher
in
the
pulpit
sunday
after
sunday
year
after
year
shrink
from
speaking
of
sin
i
refer
of
course
to
the
greatest
enemy
of
mankind
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
it
i
should
think
that
this
was
the
tenth
crop
of
the
season
and
it
was
as
good
as
the
first
i
see
no
reason
why
our
northern
soil
is
not
as
prolific
as
that
of
the
tropics
and
will
not
produce
as
many
crops
in
the
year
the
mistake
we
make
is
in
trying
to
force
things
that
are
not
natural
to
it
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
we
turn
our
attention
to
we
can
beat
the
world
i
had
no
idea
until
recently
how
generally
this
simple
and
thrifty
plant
is
feared
and
hated
far
beyond
what
i
had
regarded
as
the
bounds
of
civilization
it
is
held
as
one
of
the
mysteries
of
a
fallen
world
accompanying
the
home
missionary
on
his
wanderings
and
preceding
the
footsteps
of
the
tract
society
i
was
not
long
ago
in
the
adirondacks
we
had
built
a
camp
for
the
night
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
high
up
on
john
brook
and
near
the
foot
of
mount
marcy
i
can
see
the
lovely
spot
now
it
was
on
the
bank
of
the
crystal
rocky
stream
at
the
foot
of
high
and
slender
falls
which
poured
into
a
broad
amber
basin
out
of
this
basin
we
had
just
taken
trout
enough
for
our
supper
which
had
been
killed
and
roasted
over
the
fire
on
sharp
sticks
and
eaten
before
they
had
an
opportunity
to
feel
the
chill
of
this
deceitful
world
we
were
lying
under
the
hut
of
on
fragrant
talking
after
supper
in
front
of
us
was
a
huge
fire
of
birchlogs
and
over
it
we
could
see
the
top
of
the
falls
glistening
in
the
moonlight
and
the
roar
of
the
falls
and
the
brawling
of
the
stream
near
us
filled
all
the
ancient
woods
it
was
a
scene
upon
which
one
would
think
no
thought
of
sin
could
enter
we
were
talking
with
old
phelps
the
guide
old
phelps
is
at
once
guide
philosopher
and
friend
he
knows
the
woods
and
streams
and
mountains
and
their
savage
inhabitants
as
well
as
we
know
all
our
rich
relations
and
what
they
are
doing
and
in
lonely
and
he
has
thought
out
and
solved
most
of
the
problems
of
life
as
he
stands
in
his
he
is
as
grizzly
as
an
old
and
he
speaks
in
a
high
falsetto
voice
which
would
be
invaluable
to
a
boatswain
in
a
storm
at
sea
we
had
been
talking
of
all
subjects
about
which
rational
men
are
interested
bears
panthers
trapping
the
habits
of
trout
the
tariff
the
internal
revenue
to
wit
the
injustice
of
laying
such
a
tax
on
tobacco
and
none
on
dogs
ai
no
dog
in
the
united
states
says
the
guide
at
the
top
of
his
voice
earns
his
the
adventists
the
gorner
grat
horace
greeley
religion
the
propagation
of
seeds
in
the
wilderness
as
for
instance
where
were
the
seeds
lying
for
ages
that
spring
up
into
certain
plants
and
flowers
as
soon
as
a
spot
is
cleared
anywhere
in
the
most
remote
forest
and
why
does
a
growth
of
always
come
up
after
a
growth
of
pine
has
been
removed
in
short
we
had
pretty
nearly
reached
a
solution
of
many
mysteries
when
phelps
suddenly
exclaimed
with
uncommon
energy
there
one
thing
that
beats
me
that
we
asked
with
undisguised
curiosity
he
replied
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
has
come
to
one
door
in
life
which
is
hopelessly
shut
and
from
which
he
retires
in
despair
it
comes
from
i
do
know
nor
what
to
do
with
it
it
in
my
garden
and
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
it
beats
about
the
guide
had
no
theory
and
no
hope
a
feeling
of
awe
came
over
me
as
we
lay
there
at
midnight
hushed
by
the
sound
of
the
stream
and
the
rising
wind
in
the
then
man
can
go
nowhere
that
will
not
attend
him
though
he
camp
on
the
upper
au
sable
or
penetrate
the
forest
where
rolls
the
allegash
and
hear
no
sound
save
his
own
allegations
he
will
not
escape
it
it
has
entered
the
happy
valley
of
keene
although
there
is
yet
no
church
there
and
only
a
feeble
school
part
of
the
year
sin
travels
faster
than
they
that
ride
in
chariots
i
take
my
hoe
and
begin
but
i
feel
that
i
am
warring
against
something
whose
roots
take
hold
on
by
the
time
a
man
gets
to
be
eighty
he
learns
that
he
is
compassed
by
limitations
and
that
there
has
been
a
natural
boundary
set
to
his
individual
powers
as
he
goes
on
in
life
he
begins
to
doubt
his
ability
to
destroy
all
evil
and
to
reform
all
abuses
and
to
suspect
that
there
will
be
much
left
to
do
after
he
has
done
i
stepped
into
my
garden
in
the
spring
not
doubting
that
i
should
be
easily
master
of
the
weeds
i
have
simply
learned
that
an
institution
which
is
at
least
six
thousand
years
old
and
i
believe
six
millions
is
not
to
be
put
down
in
one
season
i
have
been
digging
my
potatoes
if
anybody
cares
to
know
it
i
planted
them
in
what
are
called
rose
the
rows
a
little
less
than
three
feet
apart
but
the
vines
came
to
an
early
close
in
the
drought
digging
potatoes
is
a
pleasant
soothing
occupation
but
not
poetical
it
is
good
for
the
mind
unless
they
are
too
small
as
many
of
mine
are
when
it
begets
a
want
of
gratitude
to
the
bountiful
earth
what
small
potatoes
we
all
are
compared
with
what
we
might
be
we
do
plow
deep
enough
any
of
us
for
one
thing
i
shall
put
in
the
plow
next
year
and
give
the
tubers
room
enough
i
think
they
felt
the
lack
of
it
this
year
many
of
them
seemed
ashamed
to
come
out
so
small
there
is
great
pleasure
in
turning
out
the
fellows
into
the
sunshine
of
a
royal
september
day
and
seeing
them
glisten
as
they
lie
thickly
strewn
on
the
warm
soil
life
has
few
such
moments
but
then
they
must
be
picked
up
the
in
this
world
is
always
the
unpleasant
part
of
it
sixteenth
week
i
do
not
hold
myself
bound
to
answer
the
question
does
gardening
pay
it
is
so
difficult
to
define
what
is
meant
by
paying
there
is
a
popular
notion
that
unless
a
thing
pays
you
had
better
let
it
alone
and
i
may
say
that
there
is
a
public
opinion
that
will
not
let
a
man
or
woman
continue
in
the
indulgence
of
a
fancy
that
does
not
pay
and
public
opinion
is
stronger
than
the
legislature
and
nearly
as
strong
as
the
ten
commandments
i
therefore
yield
to
popular
clamor
when
i
discuss
the
profit
of
my
garden
as
i
look
at
it
you
might
as
well
ask
does
a
sunset
pay
i
know
that
a
sunset
is
commonly
looked
on
as
a
cheap
entertainment
but
it
is
really
one
of
the
most
expensive
it
is
true
that
we
can
all
have
front
seats
and
we
do
not
exactly
need
to
dress
for
it
as
we
do
for
the
opera
but
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
to
be
enjoyed
are
rather
dear
among
them
i
should
name
a
good
suit
of
clothes
including
some
trifling
ornament
not
including
back
hair
for
one
sex
or
the
parting
of
it
in
the
middle
for
the
other
i
should
add
also
a
good
dinner
well
cooked
and
digestible
and
the
cost
of
a
fair
education
extended
perhaps
through
generations
in
which
sensibility
and
love
of
beauty
grew
what
i
mean
is
that
if
a
man
is
hungry
and
naked
and
half
a
savage
or
with
the
love
of
beauty
undeveloped
in
him
a
sunset
is
thrown
away
on
him
so
that
it
appears
that
the
conditions
of
the
enjoyment
of
a
sunset
are
as
costly
as
anything
in
our
civilization
of
course
there
is
no
such
thing
as
absolute
value
in
this
world
you
can
only
estimate
what
a
thing
is
worth
to
you
does
gardening
in
a
city
pay
you
might
as
well
ask
if
it
pays
to
keep
hens
or
a
or
to
wear
a
gold
ring
or
to
keep
your
lawn
cut
or
your
hair
cut
it
is
as
you
like
it
in
a
certain
sense
it
is
a
sort
of
profanation
to
consider
if
my
garden
pays
or
to
set
a
upon
my
delight
in
it
i
fear
that
you
could
not
put
it
in
money
job
had
the
right
idea
in
his
mind
when
he
asked
there
any
taste
in
the
white
of
an
egg
suppose
there
is
not
what
shall
i
set
a
price
upon
the
tender
asparagus
or
the
crisp
lettuce
which
made
the
sweet
spring
a
reality
shall
i
turn
into
merchandise
the
red
strawberry
the
pale
green
pea
the
raspberry
the
sanguinary
beet
that
the
tomato
and
the
corn
which
did
not
waste
its
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
but
after
flowing
in
a
sweet
rill
through
all
our
summer
life
mingled
at
last
with
the
engaging
bean
in
a
pool
of
succotash
shall
i
compute
in
figures
what
daily
freshness
and
health
and
delight
the
garden
yields
let
alone
the
large
crop
of
anticipation
i
gathered
as
soon
as
the
first
seeds
got
above
ground
i
appeal
to
any
gardening
man
of
sound
mind
if
that
which
pays
him
best
in
gardening
is
not
that
which
he
can
not
show
in
his
yet
i
yield
to
public
opinion
when
i
proceed
to
make
such
a
balance
and
i
do
it
with
the
utmost
confidence
in
figures
i
select
as
a
representative
vegetable
in
order
to
estimate
the
cost
of
gardening
the
potato
in
my
statement
i
shall
not
include
the
interest
on
the
value
of
the
land
i
throw
in
the
land
because
it
would
otherwise
have
stood
idle
the
thing
generally
raised
on
city
land
is
taxes
i
therefore
make
the
following
statement
of
the
cost
and
income
of
my
a
part
of
it
estimated
in
connection
with
other
garden
labor
i
have
tried
to
make
it
so
as
to
satisfy
the
collector
plowing
seed
manure
assistance
in
planting
and
digging
days
labor
of
self
in
planting
hoeing
digging
picking
up
days
at
cents
total
cost
two
thousand
five
hundred
mealy
potatoes
at
cents
small
potatoes
given
to
neighbor
pig
total
return
balance
profit
in
cellar
some
of
these
items
need
explanation
i
have
charged
nothing
for
my
own
time
waiting
for
the
potatoes
to
grow
my
time
in
hoeing
fighting
weeds
is
put
in
at
five
days
it
may
have
been
a
little
more
nor
have
i
put
in
anything
for
cooling
drinks
while
hoeing
i
leave
this
out
from
principle
because
i
always
recommend
water
to
others
i
had
some
difficulty
in
fixing
the
rate
of
my
own
wages
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
an
opportunity
of
paying
what
i
thought
labor
was
worth
and
i
determined
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
for
once
i
figured
it
right
down
to
european
prices
seventeen
cents
a
day
for
unskilled
labor
of
course
i
boarded
myself
i
ought
to
say
that
i
fixed
the
wages
after
the
work
was
done
or
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
do
as
some
masons
did
who
worked
for
me
at
four
dollars
a
day
they
lay
in
the
shade
and
slept
the
sleep
of
honest
toil
full
half
the
time
at
least
all
the
time
i
was
away
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
when
the
wages
of
mechanics
are
raised
to
eight
and
ten
dollars
a
day
the
workmen
will
not
come
at
all
they
will
merely
send
their
cards
i
do
not
see
any
possible
fault
in
the
above
figures
i
ought
to
say
that
i
deferred
putting
a
value
on
the
potatoes
until
i
had
footed
up
the
debit
column
this
is
always
the
safest
way
to
do
i
had
bushels
i
roughly
estimated
that
there
are
one
hundred
good
ones
to
the
bushel
making
my
own
market
price
i
asked
two
cents
apiece
for
them
this
i
should
have
considered
dirt
cheap
last
june
when
i
was
going
down
the
rows
with
the
hoe
if
any
one
thinks
that
two
cents
each
is
high
let
him
try
to
raise
them
nature
is
i
intend
to
be
complimentary
in
saying
so
she
shows
it
in
little
things
i
have
mentioned
my
attempt
to
put
in
a
few
modest
turnips
near
the
close
of
the
season
i
sowed
the
seeds
by
the
way
in
the
most
liberal
manner
into
three
or
four
short
rows
i
presume
i
put
enough
to
sow
an
acre
and
they
all
came
up
came
up
as
thick
as
grass
as
crowded
and
useless
as
babies
in
a
chinese
village
of
course
they
had
to
be
thinned
out
that
is
pretty
much
all
pulled
up
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
for
it
takes
a
conscientious
man
some
time
to
decide
which
are
the
best
and
healthiest
plants
to
spare
after
all
i
spared
too
many
that
is
the
great
danger
everywhere
in
this
world
it
may
not
be
in
the
next
things
are
too
thick
we
lose
all
in
grasping
for
too
much
the
scotch
say
that
no
man
ought
to
thin
out
his
own
turnips
because
he
will
not
sacrifice
enough
to
leave
room
for
the
remainder
to
grow
he
should
get
his
neighbor
who
does
not
care
for
the
plants
to
do
it
but
this
is
mere
talk
and
aside
from
the
point
if
there
is
anything
i
desire
to
avoid
in
these
agricultural
papers
it
is
digression
i
did
think
that
putting
in
these
turnips
so
late
in
the
season
when
general
activity
has
ceased
and
in
a
remote
part
of
the
garden
they
would
pass
unnoticed
but
nature
never
even
winks
as
i
can
see
the
tender
blades
were
scarcely
out
of
the
ground
when
she
sent
a
small
black
fly
which
seemed
to
have
been
born
and
held
in
reserve
for
this
purpose
to
cut
the
leaves
they
speedily
made
of
the
whole
bed
thus
everything
appears
to
have
its
special
enemy
except
perhaps
p
y
nothing
ever
troubles
that
did
the
concord
grape
ever
come
to
more
luscious
perfection
than
this
year
or
yield
so
abundantly
the
golden
sunshine
has
passed
into
them
and
distended
their
purple
skins
almost
to
bursting
such
heavy
clusters
such
bloom
such
sweetness
such
meat
and
drink
in
their
round
globes
what
a
fine
fellow
bacchus
would
have
been
if
he
had
only
signed
the
pledge
when
he
was
a
young
man
i
have
taken
off
clusters
that
were
as
compact
and
almost
as
large
as
the
black
hamburgs
it
is
slow
work
picking
them
i
do
not
see
how
the
gatherers
for
the
vintage
ever
get
off
enough
it
takes
so
long
to
disentangle
the
bunches
from
the
leaves
and
the
interlacing
vines
and
the
supporting
tendrils
and
then
i
like
to
hold
up
each
bunch
and
look
at
it
in
the
sunlight
and
get
the
fragrance
and
the
bloom
of
it
and
show
it
to
polly
who
is
making
herself
useful
as
taster
and
companion
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
before
dropping
it
into
the
basket
but
we
have
other
company
the
robin
the
most
knowing
and
greedy
bird
out
of
paradise
i
trust
he
will
always
be
kept
out
has
discovered
that
the
is
uncommonly
good
and
has
come
back
with
his
whole
tribe
and
family
larger
than
it
was
in
he
knows
the
ripest
bunches
as
well
as
anybody
and
tries
them
all
if
he
would
take
a
whole
bunch
here
and
there
say
half
the
number
and
be
off
with
it
i
should
not
so
much
care
but
he
will
not
he
pecks
away
at
all
the
bunches
and
spoils
as
many
as
he
can
it
is
time
he
went
south
there
is
no
prettier
sight
to
my
eye
than
a
gardener
on
a
ladder
in
his
in
these
golden
days
selecting
the
heaviest
clusters
of
grapes
and
handing
them
down
to
one
and
another
of
a
group
of
neighbors
and
friends
who
stand
under
the
shade
of
the
leaves
flecked
with
the
sunlight
and
cry
sweet
nice
ones
and
the
like
remarks
encouraging
to
the
man
on
the
ladder
it
is
great
pleasure
to
see
people
eat
grapes
moral
i
have
no
doubt
that
grapes
taste
best
in
other
mouths
it
is
an
old
notion
that
it
is
easier
to
be
generous
than
to
be
stingy
i
am
convinced
that
the
majority
of
people
would
be
generous
from
selfish
motives
if
they
had
the
opportunity
philosophical
nothing
shows
one
who
his
friends
are
like
prosperity
and
ripe
fruit
i
had
a
good
friend
in
the
country
whom
i
almost
never
visited
except
in
by
your
fruits
you
shall
know
them
seventeenth
week
i
like
to
go
into
the
garden
these
warm
latter
days
and
muse
to
muse
is
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
not
think
of
anything
i
am
not
sure
but
goodness
comes
out
of
people
who
bask
in
the
sun
as
it
does
out
of
a
sweet
apple
roasted
before
the
fire
the
late
september
and
october
sun
of
this
latitude
is
something
like
the
sun
of
extreme
lower
italy
you
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
it
and
apparently
soak
a
winter
supply
into
the
system
if
one
only
could
take
in
his
winter
fuel
in
this
way
the
next
great
discovery
will
very
likely
be
the
conservation
of
sunlight
in
the
correlation
of
forces
i
look
to
see
the
day
when
the
superfluous
sunshine
will
be
utilized
as
for
instance
that
which
has
burned
up
my
celery
this
year
will
be
converted
into
a
force
to
work
the
garden
this
sitting
in
the
sun
amid
the
evidences
of
a
ripe
year
is
the
easiest
part
of
gardening
i
have
experienced
but
what
a
combat
has
gone
on
here
what
vegetable
passions
have
run
the
whole
gamut
of
ambition
selfishness
greed
of
place
fruition
satiety
and
now
rest
here
in
the
truce
of
exhaustion
what
a
if
one
may
look
upon
it
so
the
corn
has
lost
its
ammunition
and
stacked
arms
in
a
slovenly
militia
sort
of
style
the
ground
vines
are
torn
trampled
and
withered
and
the
ungathered
cucumbers
worthless
melons
and
golden
squashes
lie
about
like
the
spent
bombs
and
exploded
shells
of
a
so
the
lay
on
the
sandy
plain
before
fort
fisher
after
the
capture
so
the
great
grassy
meadow
at
munich
any
morning
during
the
october
fest
is
strewn
with
empty
beermugs
history
constantly
repeats
itself
there
is
a
large
crop
of
moral
reflections
in
my
garden
which
anybody
is
at
liberty
to
gather
who
passes
this
way
i
have
tried
to
get
in
anything
that
offered
temptation
to
sin
there
would
be
no
thieves
if
there
was
nothing
to
steal
and
i
suppose
in
the
thieves
catechism
the
provider
is
as
bad
as
the
thief
and
probably
i
am
to
blame
for
leaving
out
a
few
winter
pears
which
some
predatory
boy
carried
off
on
sunday
at
first
i
was
angry
and
said
i
should
like
to
have
caught
the
urchin
in
the
act
but
on
second
thought
i
was
glad
i
did
not
the
interview
could
not
have
been
pleasant
i
should
have
known
what
to
do
with
him
the
chances
are
that
he
would
have
escaped
away
with
his
pockets
full
and
jibed
at
me
from
a
safe
distance
and
if
i
had
got
my
hands
on
him
i
should
have
been
still
more
embarrassed
if
i
had
flogged
him
he
would
have
got
over
it
a
good
deal
sooner
than
i
should
that
sort
of
boy
does
not
mind
castigation
any
more
than
he
does
tearing
his
trousers
in
the
briers
if
i
had
treated
him
with
kindness
and
conciliated
him
with
grapes
showing
him
the
enormity
of
his
offense
i
suppose
he
would
have
come
the
next
night
and
taken
the
remainder
of
the
grapes
the
truth
is
that
the
public
morality
is
lax
on
the
subject
of
fruit
if
anybody
puts
arsenic
or
gunpowder
into
his
watermelons
he
is
universally
denounced
as
a
stingy
old
murderer
by
the
community
a
great
many
people
regard
growing
fruit
as
lawful
prey
who
would
not
think
of
breaking
into
your
cellar
to
take
it
i
found
a
man
once
in
my
early
in
the
season
when
we
were
waiting
for
a
dishful
to
ripen
upon
inquiring
what
he
was
about
he
said
he
was
only
eating
some
and
the
operation
seemed
to
be
so
natural
and
simple
that
i
disliked
to
disturb
him
and
i
am
not
very
sure
that
one
has
a
right
to
the
whole
of
an
abundant
crop
of
fruit
until
he
has
gathered
it
at
least
in
a
city
garden
one
might
as
well
conform
his
theory
to
the
practice
of
the
community
as
for
children
and
it
sometimes
looks
as
if
the
chief
products
of
my
garden
were
small
boys
and
hens
it
is
admitted
that
they
are
barbarians
there
is
no
exception
among
them
to
this
condition
of
barbarism
this
is
not
to
say
that
they
are
not
attractive
for
they
have
the
virtues
as
well
as
the
vices
of
a
primitive
people
it
is
held
by
some
naturalists
that
the
child
is
only
a
zoophyte
with
a
stomach
and
feelers
radiating
from
it
in
search
of
something
to
fill
it
it
is
true
that
a
child
is
always
hungry
all
over
but
he
is
also
curious
all
over
and
his
curiosity
is
excited
about
as
early
as
his
hunger
he
immediately
begins
to
put
out
his
moral
feelers
into
the
unknown
and
the
infinite
to
discover
what
sort
of
an
existence
this
is
into
which
he
has
come
his
imagination
is
quite
as
hungry
as
his
stomach
and
again
and
again
it
is
stronger
than
his
other
appetites
you
can
easily
engage
his
imagination
in
a
story
which
will
make
him
forget
his
dinner
he
is
credulous
and
superstitious
and
open
to
all
wonder
in
this
he
is
exactly
like
the
savage
races
both
gorge
themselves
on
the
marvelous
and
all
the
unknown
is
marvelous
to
them
i
know
the
general
impression
is
that
children
must
be
governed
through
their
stomachs
i
think
they
can
be
controlled
quite
as
well
through
their
curiosity
that
being
the
more
craving
and
imperious
of
the
two
i
have
seen
children
follow
about
a
person
who
told
them
stories
and
interested
them
with
his
charming
talk
as
greedily
as
if
his
pockets
had
been
full
of
perhaps
this
fact
has
no
practical
relation
to
gardening
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
i
should
paper
the
outside
of
my
high
board
fence
with
the
leaves
of
arabian
nights
it
would
afford
me
a
good
deal
of
protection
more
in
fact
than
spikes
in
the
top
which
tear
trousers
and
encourage
profanity
but
do
not
save
much
fruit
a
spiked
fence
is
a
challenge
to
any
boy
of
spirit
but
if
the
fence
were
papered
with
would
he
not
stop
to
read
them
until
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
climb
into
the
garden
i
do
know
human
nature
is
vicious
the
boy
might
regard
the
picture
of
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
only
as
an
advertisement
of
what
was
over
the
fence
i
begin
to
find
that
the
problem
of
raising
fruit
is
nothing
to
that
of
getting
it
after
it
has
matured
so
long
as
the
law
just
in
many
respects
is
in
force
against
shooting
birds
and
small
boys
the
gardener
may
sow
in
tears
and
reap
in
vain
the
power
of
a
boy
is
to
me
something
fearful
consider
what
he
can
do
you
buy
and
set
out
a
choice
you
enrich
the
earth
for
it
you
train
and
trim
it
and
vanquish
the
borer
and
watch
its
slow
growth
at
length
it
rewards
your
care
by
producing
two
or
three
pears
which
you
cut
up
and
divide
in
the
family
declaring
the
flavor
of
the
bit
you
eat
to
be
something
extraordinary
the
next
year
the
little
tree
blossoms
full
and
sets
well
and
in
the
autumn
has
on
its
slender
drooping
limbs
half
a
bushel
of
fruit
daily
growing
more
delicious
in
the
sun
you
show
it
to
your
friends
reading
to
them
the
french
name
which
you
can
never
remember
on
the
label
and
you
take
an
honest
pride
in
the
successful
fruit
of
long
care
that
night
your
pears
shall
be
required
of
you
by
a
boy
along
comes
an
irresponsible
urchin
who
has
not
been
growing
much
longer
than
the
tree
with
not
cents
worth
of
clothing
on
him
and
in
five
minutes
takes
off
every
pear
and
retires
into
safe
obscurity
in
five
minutes
the
remorseless
boy
has
undone
your
work
of
years
and
with
the
easy
nonchalance
i
doubt
not
of
any
agent
of
fate
in
whose
path
nothing
is
sacred
or
safe
and
it
is
not
of
much
consequence
the
boy
goes
on
his
way
to
congress
or
to
state
prison
in
either
place
he
will
be
accused
of
stealing
perhaps
wrongfully
you
learn
in
time
that
it
is
better
to
have
had
pears
and
lost
them
than
not
to
have
had
pears
at
all
you
come
to
know
that
the
least
and
rarest
part
of
the
pleasure
of
raising
fruit
is
the
vulgar
eating
it
you
recall
your
delight
in
conversing
with
the
nurseryman
and
looking
at
his
illustrated
catalogues
where
all
the
pears
are
drawn
perfect
in
form
and
of
extra
size
and
at
that
exact
moment
between
ripeness
and
decay
which
it
is
so
impossible
to
hit
in
practice
fruit
can
not
be
raised
on
this
earth
to
taste
as
you
imagine
those
pears
would
taste
for
years
you
have
this
pleasure
unalloyed
by
any
disenchanting
reality
how
you
watch
the
tender
twigs
in
spring
and
the
freshly
forming
bark
hovering
about
the
healthy
growing
tree
with
your
many
a
sunny
morning
that
is
happiness
then
if
you
know
it
you
are
drinking
the
very
wine
of
life
and
when
the
sweet
juices
of
the
earth
mount
the
limbs
and
flow
down
the
tender
stem
ripening
and
reddening
the
pendent
fruit
you
feel
that
you
somehow
stand
at
the
source
of
things
and
have
no
unimportant
share
in
the
processes
of
nature
enter
at
this
moment
boy
the
destroyer
whose
office
is
that
of
preserver
as
well
for
though
he
removes
the
fruit
from
your
sight
it
remains
in
your
memory
immortally
ripe
and
desirable
the
gardener
needs
all
these
consolations
of
a
high
philosophy
eighteenth
week
regrets
are
idle
yet
history
is
one
long
regret
everything
might
have
turned
out
so
differently
if
ravaillac
had
not
been
imprisoned
for
debt
he
would
not
have
stabbed
henry
of
navarre
if
william
of
orange
had
escaped
assassination
by
philip
emissaries
if
france
had
followed
the
french
calvin
and
embraced
protestant
calvinism
as
it
came
very
near
doing
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
if
the
continental
ammunition
had
not
given
out
at
bunker
hill
if
blucher
had
not
at
waterloo
the
lesson
is
that
things
do
not
come
up
unless
they
are
planted
when
you
go
behind
the
historical
scenery
you
find
there
is
a
rope
and
pulley
to
effect
every
transformation
which
has
astonished
you
it
was
the
rascality
of
a
minister
and
a
contractor
five
years
before
that
lost
the
battle
and
the
cause
of
the
defeat
was
worthless
ammunition
i
should
like
to
know
how
many
wars
have
been
caused
by
fits
of
indigestion
and
how
many
more
dynasties
have
been
upset
by
the
love
of
woman
than
by
the
hate
of
man
it
is
only
because
we
are
ill
informed
that
anything
surprises
us
and
we
are
disappointed
because
we
expect
that
for
which
we
have
not
provided
i
had
too
vague
expectations
of
what
my
garden
would
do
of
itself
a
garden
ought
to
produce
one
everything
just
as
a
business
ought
to
support
a
man
and
a
house
ought
to
keep
itself
we
had
a
convention
lately
to
resolve
that
the
house
should
keep
itself
but
it
wo
there
has
been
a
lively
time
in
our
garden
this
summer
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
very
little
to
show
for
it
it
has
been
a
terrible
campaign
but
where
is
the
indemnity
where
are
all
and
lorraine
it
is
true
that
we
have
lived
on
the
country
but
we
desire
besides
the
fruits
of
the
war
there
are
no
onions
for
one
thing
i
am
quite
ashamed
to
take
people
into
my
garden
and
have
them
notice
the
absence
of
onions
it
is
very
marked
in
onion
is
strength
and
a
garden
without
it
lacks
flavor
the
onion
in
its
satin
wrappings
is
among
the
most
beautiful
of
vegetables
and
it
is
the
only
one
that
represents
the
essence
of
things
it
can
almost
be
said
to
have
a
soul
you
take
off
coat
after
coat
and
the
onion
is
still
there
and
when
the
last
one
is
removed
who
dare
say
that
the
onion
itself
is
destroyed
though
you
can
weep
over
its
departed
spirit
if
there
is
any
one
thing
on
this
fallen
earth
that
the
angels
in
heaven
weep
over
more
than
another
it
is
the
onion
i
know
that
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
prejudice
against
the
onion
but
i
think
there
is
rather
a
cowardice
in
regard
to
it
i
doubt
not
that
all
men
and
women
love
the
onion
but
few
confess
their
love
affection
for
it
is
concealed
good
are
as
shy
of
owning
it
as
they
are
of
talking
about
religion
some
people
have
days
on
which
they
eat
onions
what
you
might
call
or
their
the
act
is
in
the
nature
of
a
religious
ceremony
an
eleusinian
mystery
not
a
breath
of
it
must
get
abroad
on
that
day
they
see
no
company
they
deny
the
kiss
of
greeting
to
the
dearest
friend
they
retire
within
themselves
and
hold
communion
with
one
of
the
most
pungent
and
penetrating
manifestations
of
the
moral
vegetable
world
happy
is
said
to
be
the
family
which
can
eat
onions
together
they
are
for
the
time
being
separate
from
the
world
and
have
a
harmony
of
aspiration
there
is
a
hint
here
for
the
reformers
let
them
become
apostles
of
the
onion
let
them
eat
and
preach
it
to
their
fellows
and
circulate
tracts
of
it
in
the
form
of
seeds
in
the
onion
is
the
hope
of
universal
brotherhood
if
all
men
will
eat
onions
at
all
times
they
will
come
into
a
universal
sympathy
look
at
italy
i
hope
i
am
not
mistaken
as
to
the
cause
of
her
unity
it
was
the
reds
who
preached
the
gospel
which
made
it
possible
all
the
reds
of
europe
all
the
sworn
devotees
of
the
mystic
mary
ann
eat
of
the
common
vegetable
their
oaths
are
strong
with
it
it
is
the
food
also
of
the
common
people
of
italy
all
the
social
atmosphere
of
that
delicious
land
is
laden
with
it
its
odor
is
a
practical
democracy
in
the
churches
all
are
alike
there
is
one
faith
one
smell
the
entrance
of
victor
emanuel
into
rome
is
only
the
pompous
proclamation
of
a
unity
which
garlic
had
already
accomplished
and
yet
we
who
boast
of
our
democracy
eat
onions
in
secret
i
now
see
that
i
have
left
out
many
of
the
most
moral
elements
neither
onions
parsnips
carrots
nor
cabbages
are
here
i
have
never
seen
a
garden
in
the
autumn
before
without
the
uncouth
cabbage
in
it
but
my
garden
gives
the
impression
of
a
garden
without
a
head
the
cabbage
is
the
rose
of
holland
i
admire
the
force
by
which
it
compacts
its
crisp
leaves
into
a
solid
head
the
secret
of
it
would
be
priceless
to
the
world
we
should
see
less
expansive
foreheads
with
nothing
within
even
the
largest
cabbages
are
not
always
the
best
but
i
mention
these
things
not
from
any
sympathy
i
have
with
the
vegetables
named
but
to
show
how
hard
it
is
to
go
contrary
to
the
expectations
of
society
society
expects
every
man
to
have
certain
things
in
his
garden
not
to
raise
cabbage
is
as
if
one
had
no
pew
in
church
perhaps
we
shall
come
some
day
to
free
churches
and
free
gardens
when
i
can
show
my
neighbor
through
my
tired
garden
at
the
end
of
the
season
when
skies
are
overcast
and
brown
leaves
are
swirling
down
and
not
mind
if
he
does
raise
his
eyebrows
when
he
observes
i
see
you
have
none
of
this
and
of
at
present
we
want
the
moral
courage
to
plant
only
what
we
need
to
spend
only
what
will
bring
us
peace
regardless
of
what
is
going
on
over
the
fence
we
are
half
ruined
by
conformity
but
we
should
be
wholly
ruined
without
it
and
i
presume
i
shall
make
a
garden
next
year
that
will
be
as
popular
as
possible
and
this
brings
me
to
what
i
see
may
be
a
crisis
in
life
i
begin
to
feel
the
temptation
of
experiment
agriculture
horticulture
floriculture
these
are
vast
fields
into
which
one
may
wander
away
and
never
be
seen
more
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
simple
thing
this
gardening
but
it
opens
up
astonishingly
it
is
like
the
infinite
possibilities
in
polly
sometimes
says
to
me
wish
you
would
call
at
bobbin
and
match
that
skein
of
worsted
for
me
when
you
are
in
time
was
i
used
to
accept
such
a
commission
with
alacrity
and
i
went
to
bobbin
and
asked
one
of
his
young
men
with
easy
indifference
to
give
me
some
of
that
the
young
man
who
is
as
handsome
a
young
man
as
ever
i
looked
at
and
who
appears
to
own
the
shop
and
whose
suave
superciliousness
would
be
worth
everything
to
a
cabinet
minister
who
wanted
to
repel
applicants
for
place
says
have
an
ounce
i
have
sent
to
paris
and
i
expect
it
every
day
i
have
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
getting
that
shade
in
my
to
think
that
he
is
in
communication
with
paris
and
perhaps
with
persia
respect
for
such
a
being
gives
place
to
awe
i
go
to
another
shop
holding
fast
to
my
scarlet
clew
there
i
am
shown
a
heap
of
stuff
with
more
colors
and
shades
than
i
had
supposed
existed
in
all
the
world
what
a
blaze
of
distraction
i
have
been
told
to
get
as
near
the
shade
as
i
could
and
so
i
compare
and
contrast
till
the
whole
thing
seems
to
me
about
of
one
color
but
i
can
settle
my
mind
on
nothing
the
affair
assumes
a
high
degree
of
importance
i
am
satisfied
with
nothing
but
perfection
i
do
know
what
may
happen
if
the
shade
is
not
matched
i
go
to
another
shop
and
another
and
another
at
last
a
pretty
girl
who
could
make
any
customer
believe
that
green
is
blue
matches
the
shade
in
a
minute
i
buy
five
cents
worth
that
was
the
order
women
are
the
most
economical
persons
that
ever
were
i
have
spent
two
hours
in
this
business
but
who
shall
say
they
were
wasted
when
i
take
the
stuff
home
and
polly
says
it
is
a
perfect
match
and
looks
so
pleased
and
holds
it
up
with
the
work
at
arm
length
and
turns
her
head
one
side
and
then
takes
her
needle
and
works
it
in
working
in
i
can
see
my
own
obligingness
and
amiability
with
every
stitch
five
cents
is
dirt
cheap
for
such
a
pleasure
the
things
i
may
do
in
my
garden
multiply
on
my
vision
how
fascinating
have
the
catalogues
of
the
nurserymen
become
can
i
raise
all
those
beautiful
varieties
each
one
of
which
is
preferable
to
the
other
shall
i
try
all
the
kinds
of
grapes
and
all
the
sorts
of
pears
i
have
already
fifteen
varieties
of
strawberries
vines
and
i
have
no
idea
that
i
have
hit
the
right
one
must
i
subscribe
to
all
the
magazines
and
weekly
papers
which
offer
premiums
of
the
best
vines
oh
that
all
the
strawberries
were
rolled
into
one
that
i
could
inclose
all
its
lusciousness
in
one
bite
oh
for
the
good
old
days
when
a
strawberry
was
a
strawberry
and
there
was
no
perplexity
about
it
there
are
more
berries
now
than
churches
and
no
one
knows
what
to
believe
i
have
seen
gardens
which
were
all
experiment
given
over
to
every
new
thing
and
which
produced
little
or
nothing
to
the
owners
except
the
pleasure
of
expectation
people
grow
at
great
expense
of
time
and
money
which
never
yield
them
more
than
four
pears
to
the
tree
the
fashions
of
ladies
bonnets
are
nothing
to
the
fashions
of
nurserymen
he
who
attempts
to
follow
them
has
a
business
for
life
but
his
life
may
be
short
if
i
enter
upon
this
wide
field
of
horticultural
experiment
i
shall
leave
peace
behind
and
i
may
expect
the
ground
to
open
and
swallow
me
and
all
my
fortune
may
heaven
keep
me
to
the
old
roots
and
herbs
of
my
forefathers
perhaps
in
the
world
of
modern
reforms
this
is
not
possible
but
i
intend
now
to
cultivate
only
the
standard
things
and
learn
to
talk
knowingly
of
the
rest
of
course
one
must
keep
up
a
reputation
i
have
seen
people
greatly
enjoy
themselves
and
elevate
themselves
in
their
own
esteem
in
a
wise
and
critical
talk
about
all
the
choice
wines
while
they
were
sipping
a
decoction
the
original
cost
of
which
bore
no
relation
to
the
price
of
grapes
nineteenth
week
the
closing
scenes
are
not
necessarily
funereal
a
garden
should
be
got
ready
for
winter
as
well
as
for
summer
when
one
goes
into
he
wants
everything
neat
and
trim
expecting
high
winds
we
bring
everything
into
close
reef
some
men
there
are
who
never
shave
if
they
are
so
absurd
as
ever
to
shave
except
when
they
go
abroad
and
who
do
not
take
care
to
wear
polished
boots
in
the
bosoms
of
their
families
i
like
a
man
who
shaves
next
to
one
who
does
shave
to
satisfy
his
own
conscience
and
not
for
display
and
who
dresses
as
neatly
at
home
as
he
does
anywhere
such
a
man
will
be
likely
to
put
his
garden
in
complete
order
before
the
snow
comes
so
that
its
last
days
shall
not
present
a
scene
of
melancholy
ruin
and
decay
i
confess
that
after
such
an
exhausting
campaign
i
felt
a
great
temptation
to
retire
and
call
it
a
drawn
engagement
but
better
counsels
prevailed
i
determined
that
the
weeds
should
not
sleep
on
the
field
of
battle
i
routed
them
out
and
leveled
their
works
i
am
master
of
the
situation
if
i
have
made
a
desert
i
at
least
have
peace
but
it
is
not
quite
a
desert
the
strawberries
the
raspberries
the
celery
the
turnips
wave
green
above
the
clean
earth
with
no
enemy
in
sight
in
these
golden
october
days
no
work
is
more
fascinating
than
this
getting
ready
for
spring
the
sun
is
no
longer
a
burning
enemy
but
a
friend
illuminating
all
the
open
space
and
warming
the
mellow
soil
and
the
pruning
and
clearing
away
of
rubbish
and
the
fertilizing
go
on
with
something
of
the
hilarity
of
a
wake
rather
than
the
despondency
of
other
funerals
when
the
wind
begins
to
come
out
of
the
northwest
of
set
purpose
and
to
sweep
the
ground
with
low
and
searching
fierceness
very
different
from
the
roistering
jolly
bluster
of
early
fall
i
have
put
the
strawberries
under
their
coverlet
of
leaves
pruned
the
and
laid
them
under
the
soil
tied
up
the
tender
plants
given
the
fruit
trees
a
good
solid
meal
about
the
roots
and
so
i
turn
away
writing
resurgam
on
the
gatepost
and
calvin
aware
that
the
summer
is
past
and
the
harvest
is
ended
and
that
a
mouse
in
the
kitchen
is
worth
two
birds
gone
south
scampers
away
to
the
house
with
his
tail
in
the
air
and
yet
i
am
not
perfectly
at
rest
in
my
mind
i
know
that
this
is
only
a
truce
until
the
parties
recover
their
exhausted
energies
all
winter
long
the
forces
of
chemistry
will
be
mustering
under
ground
repairing
the
losses
calling
up
the
reserves
getting
new
strength
from
my
bounty
and
making
ready
for
the
spring
campaign
they
will
open
it
before
i
am
ready
while
the
snow
is
scarcely
melted
and
the
ground
is
not
passable
they
will
begin
to
move
on
my
works
and
the
fight
will
commence
yet
how
deceitfully
it
will
open
to
the
music
of
birds
and
the
soft
enchantment
of
the
spring
mornings
i
shall
even
be
permitted
to
win
a
few
skirmishes
the
secret
forces
will
even
wait
for
me
to
plant
and
sow
and
show
my
full
hand
before
they
come
on
in
heavy
and
determined
assault
there
are
already
signs
of
an
internecine
fight
with
the
which
has
intrenched
itself
in
a
considerable
portion
of
my
it
contests
the
ground
inch
by
inch
and
digging
it
out
is
very
much
such
labor
as
eating
a
piece
of
pie
with
the
stones
all
in
it
is
work
too
that
i
know
by
experience
i
shall
have
to
do
alone
every
man
must
eradicate
his
own
the
neighbors
who
have
leisure
to
help
you
in
time
are
all
busy
when
is
most
aggressive
my
visits
are
well
timed
it
is
only
their
hens
which
have
seasons
for
their
own
i
am
told
that
abundant
and
rank
weeds
are
signs
of
a
rich
soil
but
i
have
noticed
that
a
thin
poor
soil
grows
little
but
weeds
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
substratum
is
the
same
and
that
the
only
choice
in
this
world
is
what
kind
of
weeds
you
will
have
i
am
not
much
attracted
by
the
gaunt
flavorless
mullein
and
the
wiry
thistle
of
upland
country
pastures
where
the
grass
is
always
gray
as
if
the
world
were
already
weary
and
sick
of
life
the
awkward
uncouth
wickedness
of
remote
where
culture
has
died
out
after
the
first
crop
is
about
as
disagreeable
as
the
ranker
and
richer
vice
of
city
life
forced
by
artificial
heat
and
the
juices
of
an
overfed
civilization
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
the
whole
the
rich
soil
is
the
best
the
fruit
of
it
has
body
and
flavor
to
what
affluence
does
a
woman
to
take
an
instance
thank
heaven
which
is
common
grow
with
favoring
circumstances
under
the
stimulus
of
the
richest
social
and
intellectual
influences
i
am
aware
that
there
has
been
a
good
deal
said
in
poetry
about
the
fringed
gentian
and
the
harebell
of
rocky
districts
and
waysides
and
i
know
that
it
is
possible
for
maidens
to
bloom
in
very
slight
soil
into
a
grace
and
beauty
yet
the
world
through
they
lack
that
wealth
of
charms
that
tropic
affluence
of
both
person
and
mind
which
higher
and
more
stimulating
culture
brings
the
passion
as
well
as
the
soul
glowing
in
the
rose
neither
persons
nor
plants
are
ever
fully
themselves
until
they
are
cultivated
to
their
highest
i
for
one
have
no
fear
that
society
will
be
too
much
enriched
the
only
question
is
about
keeping
down
the
weeds
and
i
have
learned
by
experience
that
we
need
new
sorts
of
hoes
and
more
disposition
to
use
them
moral
the
difference
between
soil
and
society
is
evident
we
bury
decay
in
the
earth
we
plant
in
it
the
perishing
we
feed
it
with
offensive
refuse
but
nothing
grows
out
of
it
that
is
not
clean
it
gives
us
back
life
and
beauty
for
our
rubbish
society
returns
us
what
we
give
it
pretending
to
reflect
upon
these
things
but
in
reality
watching
the
who
are
pecking
at
the
purple
berries
of
the
woodbine
on
the
south
gable
i
approach
the
house
polly
is
picking
up
chestnuts
on
the
sward
regardless
of
the
high
wind
which
rattles
them
about
her
head
and
upon
the
glass
roof
of
her
the
garden
i
see
is
filled
with
thrifty
plants
which
will
make
it
always
summer
there
the
callas
about
the
fountain
will
be
in
flower
by
christmas
the
plant
appears
to
keep
that
holiday
in
her
secret
heart
all
summer
i
close
the
outer
windows
as
we
go
along
and
congratulate
myself
that
we
are
ready
for
winter
for
the
i
have
no
responsibility
polly
has
entire
charge
of
it
i
am
only
required
to
keep
it
heated
and
not
too
hot
either
to
smoke
it
often
for
the
death
of
the
bugs
to
water
it
once
a
day
to
move
this
and
that
into
the
sun
and
out
of
the
sun
pretty
constantly
but
she
does
all
the
work
we
never
relinquish
that
theory
as
we
pass
around
the
house
i
discover
a
boy
in
the
ravine
filling
a
bag
with
chestnuts
and
hickorynuts
they
are
not
plenty
this
year
and
i
suggest
the
propriety
of
leaving
some
for
us
the
boy
is
a
little
slow
to
take
the
idea
but
he
has
apparently
found
the
picking
poor
and
exhausted
it
for
as
he
turns
away
down
the
glen
he
hails
me
with
i
say
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
some
walnuts
the
coolness
of
this
world
grows
upon
me
it
is
time
to
go
in
and
light
a
on
the
hearth
calvin
the
following
brief
memoir
of
one
of
the
characters
in
this
book
is
added
by
his
friend
in
the
hope
that
the
record
of
an
exemplary
fife
in
an
humble
sphere
may
be
of
some
service
to
the
world
hartford
january
calvin
a
study
of
character
calvin
is
dead
his
life
long
to
him
but
short
for
the
rest
of
us
was
not
marked
by
startling
adventures
but
his
character
was
so
uncommon
and
his
qualities
were
so
worthy
of
imitation
that
i
have
been
asked
by
those
who
personally
knew
him
to
set
down
my
recollections
of
his
career
his
origin
and
ancestry
were
shrouded
in
mystery
even
his
age
was
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture
although
he
was
of
the
maltese
race
i
have
reason
to
suppose
that
he
was
american
by
birth
as
he
certainly
was
in
sympathy
calvin
was
given
to
me
eight
years
ago
by
stowe
but
she
knew
nothing
of
his
age
or
origin
he
walked
into
her
house
one
day
out
of
the
great
unknown
and
became
at
once
at
home
as
if
he
had
been
always
a
friend
of
the
family
he
appeared
to
have
artistic
and
literary
tastes
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
inquired
at
the
door
if
that
was
the
residence
of
the
author
of
tom
cabin
and
upon
being
assured
that
it
was
bad
decided
to
dwell
there
this
is
of
course
fanciful
for
his
antecedents
were
wholly
unknown
but
in
his
time
he
could
hardly
have
been
in
any
household
where
he
would
not
have
heard
talked
about
when
he
came
to
stowe
he
was
as
large
as
he
ever
was
and
apparently
as
old
as
he
ever
became
yet
there
was
in
him
no
appearance
of
age
he
was
in
the
happy
maturity
of
all
his
powers
and
you
would
rather
have
said
that
in
that
maturity
he
had
found
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
and
it
was
as
difficult
to
believe
that
he
would
ever
be
aged
as
it
was
to
imagine
that
he
had
ever
been
in
immature
youth
there
was
in
him
a
mysterious
perpetuity
after
some
years
when
stowe
made
her
winter
home
in
florida
calvin
came
to
live
with
us
from
the
first
moment
he
fell
into
the
ways
of
the
house
and
assumed
a
recognized
position
in
the
family
i
say
recognized
because
after
he
became
known
he
was
always
inquired
for
by
visitors
and
in
the
letters
to
the
other
members
of
the
family
he
always
received
a
message
although
the
least
obtrusive
of
beings
his
individuality
always
made
itself
felt
his
personal
appearance
had
much
to
do
with
this
for
he
was
of
royal
mould
and
had
an
air
of
high
breeding
he
was
large
but
he
had
nothing
of
the
fat
grossness
of
the
celebrated
angora
family
though
powerful
he
was
exquisitely
proportioned
and
as
graceful
in
every
movement
as
a
young
leopard
when
he
stood
up
to
open
a
door
he
opened
all
the
doors
with
latches
he
was
portentously
tall
and
when
stretched
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
he
seemed
too
long
for
this
world
as
indeed
he
was
his
coat
was
the
finest
and
softest
i
have
ever
seen
a
shade
of
quiet
maltese
and
from
his
throat
downward
underneath
to
the
white
tips
of
his
feet
he
wore
the
whitest
and
most
delicate
ermine
and
no
person
was
ever
more
fastidiously
neat
in
his
finely
formed
head
you
saw
something
of
his
aristocratic
character
the
ears
were
small
and
cleanly
cut
there
was
a
tinge
of
pink
in
the
nostrils
his
face
was
handsome
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
exceedingly
intelligent
i
should
call
it
even
a
sweet
expression
if
the
term
were
not
inconsistent
with
his
look
of
alertness
and
sagacity
it
is
difficult
to
convey
a
just
idea
of
his
gayety
in
connection
with
his
dignity
and
gravity
which
his
name
expressed
as
we
know
nothing
of
his
family
of
course
it
will
be
understood
that
calvin
was
his
christian
name
he
had
times
of
relaxation
into
utter
playfulness
delighting
in
a
ball
of
yarn
catching
sportively
at
stray
ribbons
when
his
mistress
was
at
her
toilet
and
pursuing
his
own
tail
with
hilarity
for
lack
of
anything
better
he
could
amuse
himself
by
the
hour
and
he
did
not
care
for
children
perhaps
something
in
his
past
was
present
to
his
memory
he
had
absolutely
no
bad
habits
and
his
disposition
was
perfect
i
never
saw
him
exactly
angry
though
i
have
seen
his
tail
grow
to
an
enormous
size
when
a
strange
cat
appeared
upon
his
lawn
he
disliked
cats
evidently
regarding
them
as
feline
and
treacherous
and
he
had
no
association
with
them
occasionally
there
would
be
heard
a
night
concert
in
the
shrubbery
calvin
would
ask
to
have
the
door
opened
and
then
you
would
hear
a
rush
and
a
and
the
concert
would
explode
and
calvin
would
quietly
come
in
and
resume
his
seat
on
the
hearth
there
was
no
trace
of
anger
in
his
manner
but
he
would
have
any
of
that
about
the
house
he
had
the
rare
virtue
of
magnanimity
although
he
had
fixed
notions
about
his
own
rights
and
extraordinary
persistency
in
getting
them
he
never
showed
temper
at
a
repulse
he
simply
and
firmly
persisted
till
he
had
what
he
wanted
his
diet
was
one
point
his
idea
was
that
of
the
scholars
about
dictionaries
to
the
he
knew
as
well
as
any
one
what
was
in
the
house
and
would
refuse
beef
if
turkey
was
to
be
had
and
if
there
were
oysters
he
would
wait
over
the
turkey
to
see
if
the
oysters
would
not
be
forthcoming
and
yet
he
was
not
a
gross
gourmand
he
would
eat
bread
if
he
saw
me
eating
it
and
thought
he
was
not
being
imposed
on
his
habits
of
feeding
also
were
refined
he
never
used
a
knife
and
he
would
put
up
his
hand
and
draw
the
fork
down
to
his
mouth
as
gracefully
as
a
grown
person
unless
necessity
compelled
he
would
not
eat
in
the
kitchen
but
insisted
upon
his
meals
in
the
and
would
wait
patiently
unless
a
stranger
were
present
and
then
he
was
sure
to
importune
the
visitor
hoping
that
the
latter
was
ignorant
of
the
rule
of
the
house
and
would
give
him
something
they
used
to
say
that
he
preferred
as
his
on
the
floor
a
certain
church
journal
but
this
was
said
by
an
episcopalian
so
far
as
i
know
he
had
no
religious
prejudices
except
that
he
did
not
like
the
association
with
romanists
he
tolerated
the
servants
because
they
belonged
to
the
house
and
would
sometimes
linger
by
the
kitchen
stove
but
the
moment
visitors
came
in
he
arose
opened
the
door
and
marched
into
the
yet
he
enjoyed
the
company
of
his
equals
and
never
withdrew
no
matter
how
many
callers
whom
he
recognized
as
of
his
society
might
come
into
the
calvin
was
fond
of
company
but
he
wanted
to
choose
it
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
was
an
aristocratic
fastidiousness
rather
than
one
of
faith
it
is
so
with
most
people
the
intelligence
of
calvin
was
something
phenomenal
in
his
rank
of
life
he
established
a
method
of
communicating
his
wants
and
even
some
of
his
sentiments
and
he
could
help
himself
in
many
things
there
was
a
furnace
register
in
a
retired
room
where
he
used
to
go
when
he
wished
to
be
alone
that
he
always
opened
when
he
desired
more
heat
but
he
never
shut
it
any
more
than
he
shut
the
door
after
himself
he
could
do
almost
everything
but
speak
and
you
would
declare
sometimes
that
you
could
see
a
pathetic
longing
to
do
that
in
his
intelligent
face
i
have
no
desire
to
overdraw
his
qualities
but
if
there
was
one
thing
in
him
more
noticeable
than
another
it
was
his
fondness
for
nature
he
could
content
himself
for
hours
at
a
low
window
looking
into
the
ravine
and
at
the
great
trees
noting
the
smallest
stir
there
he
delighted
above
all
things
to
accompany
me
walking
about
the
garden
hearing
the
birds
getting
the
smell
of
the
fresh
earth
and
rejoicing
in
the
sunshine
he
followed
me
and
gamboled
like
a
dog
rolling
over
on
the
turf
and
exhibiting
his
delight
in
a
hundred
ways
if
i
worked
he
sat
and
watched
me
or
looked
off
over
the
bank
and
kept
his
ear
open
to
the
twitter
in
the
when
it
stormed
he
was
sure
to
sit
at
the
window
keenly
watching
the
rain
or
the
snow
glancing
up
and
down
at
its
falling
and
a
winter
tempest
always
delighted
him
i
think
he
was
genuinely
fond
of
birds
but
so
far
as
i
know
he
usually
confined
himself
to
one
a
day
he
never
killed
as
some
sportsmen
do
for
the
sake
of
killing
but
only
as
civilized
people
do
from
necessity
he
was
intimate
with
the
who
dwell
in
the
too
intimate
for
almost
every
day
in
the
summer
he
would
bring
in
one
until
he
nearly
discouraged
them
he
was
indeed
a
superb
hunter
and
would
have
been
a
devastating
one
if
his
bump
of
destructiveness
had
not
been
offset
by
a
bump
of
moderation
there
was
very
little
of
the
brutality
of
the
lower
animals
about
him
i
think
he
enjoyed
rats
for
themselves
but
he
knew
his
business
and
for
the
first
few
months
of
his
residence
with
us
he
waged
an
awful
campaign
against
the
horde
and
after
that
his
simple
presence
was
sufficient
to
deter
them
from
coming
on
the
premises
mice
amused
him
but
he
usually
considered
them
too
small
game
to
be
taken
seriously
i
have
seen
him
play
for
an
hour
with
a
mouse
and
then
let
him
go
with
a
royal
condescension
in
this
whole
matter
of
a
living
calvin
was
a
great
contrast
to
the
rapacity
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
i
hesitate
a
little
to
speak
of
his
capacity
for
friendship
and
the
affectionateness
of
his
nature
for
i
know
from
his
own
reserve
that
he
would
not
care
to
have
it
much
talked
about
we
understood
each
other
perfectly
but
we
never
made
any
fuss
about
it
when
i
spoke
his
name
and
snapped
my
fingers
he
came
to
me
when
i
returned
home
at
night
he
was
pretty
sure
to
be
waiting
for
me
near
the
gate
and
would
rise
and
saunter
along
the
walk
as
if
his
being
there
were
purely
accidental
so
shy
was
he
commonly
of
showing
feeling
and
when
i
opened
the
door
he
never
rushed
in
like
a
cat
but
loitered
and
lounged
as
if
he
had
no
intention
of
going
in
but
would
condescend
to
and
yet
the
fact
was
he
knew
dinner
was
ready
and
he
was
bound
to
be
there
he
kept
the
run
of
it
happened
sometimes
during
our
absence
in
the
summer
that
dinner
would
be
early
and
calvin
walking
about
the
grounds
missed
it
and
came
in
late
but
he
never
made
a
mistake
the
second
day
there
was
one
thing
he
never
did
he
never
rushed
through
an
open
doorway
he
never
forgot
his
dignity
if
he
had
asked
to
have
the
door
opened
and
was
eager
to
go
out
he
always
went
deliberately
i
can
see
him
now
standing
on
the
sill
looking
about
at
the
sky
as
if
he
was
thinking
whether
it
were
worth
while
to
take
an
umbrella
until
he
was
near
having
his
tail
shut
in
his
friendship
was
rather
constant
than
demonstrative
when
we
returned
from
an
absence
of
nearly
two
years
calvin
welcomed
us
with
evident
pleasure
but
showed
his
satisfaction
rather
by
tranquil
happiness
than
by
fuming
about
he
had
the
faculty
of
making
us
glad
to
get
home
it
was
his
constancy
that
was
so
attractive
he
liked
companionship
but
he
would
be
petted
or
fussed
over
or
sit
in
any
one
lap
a
moment
he
always
extricated
himself
from
such
familiarity
with
dignity
and
with
no
show
of
temper
if
there
was
any
petting
to
be
done
however
he
chose
to
do
it
often
he
would
sit
looking
at
me
and
then
moved
by
a
delicate
affection
come
and
pull
at
my
coat
and
sleeve
until
he
could
touch
my
face
with
his
nose
and
then
go
away
contented
he
had
a
habit
of
coming
to
my
study
in
the
morning
sitting
quietly
by
my
side
or
on
the
table
for
hours
watching
the
pen
run
over
the
paper
occasionally
swinging
his
tail
round
for
a
blotter
and
then
going
to
sleep
among
the
papers
by
the
inkstand
or
more
rarely
he
would
watch
the
writing
from
a
perch
on
my
shoulder
writing
always
interested
him
and
until
he
understood
it
he
wanted
to
hold
the
pen
he
always
held
himself
in
a
kind
of
reserve
with
his
friend
as
if
he
had
said
us
respect
our
personality
and
not
make
a
of
he
saw
with
emerson
the
risk
of
degrading
it
to
trivial
conveniency
insist
on
rash
personal
relations
with
your
friend
this
touching
and
yet
i
would
not
give
an
unfair
notion
of
his
aloofness
his
fine
sense
of
the
sacredness
of
the
me
and
the
and
at
the
risk
of
not
being
believed
i
will
relate
an
incident
which
was
often
repeated
calvin
had
the
practice
of
passing
a
portion
of
the
night
in
the
contemplation
of
its
beauties
and
would
come
into
our
chamber
over
the
roof
of
the
conservatory
through
the
open
window
summer
and
winter
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
foot
of
my
bed
he
would
do
this
always
exactly
in
this
way
he
never
was
content
to
stay
in
the
chamber
if
we
compelled
him
to
go
upstairs
and
through
the
door
he
had
the
obstinacy
of
general
grant
but
this
is
by
the
way
in
the
morning
he
performed
his
toilet
and
went
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
of
the
family
now
when
the
mistress
was
absent
from
home
and
at
no
other
time
calvin
would
come
in
the
morning
when
the
bell
rang
to
the
head
of
the
bed
put
up
his
feet
and
look
into
my
face
follow
me
about
when
i
rose
at
the
dressing
and
in
many
purring
ways
show
his
fondness
as
if
he
had
plainly
said
know
that
she
has
gone
away
but
i
am
such
was
calvin
in
rare
moments
he
had
his
limitations
whatever
passion
he
had
for
nature
he
had
no
conception
of
art
there
was
sent
to
him
once
a
fine
and
very
expressive
cat
head
in
bronze
by
fremiet
i
placed
it
on
the
floor
he
regarded
it
intently
approached
it
cautiously
and
crouchingly
touched
it
with
his
nose
perceived
the
fraud
turned
away
abruptly
and
never
would
notice
it
afterward
on
the
whole
his
life
was
not
only
a
successful
one
but
a
happy
one
he
never
had
but
one
fear
so
far
as
i
know
he
had
a
mortal
and
a
reasonable
terror
of
plumbers
he
would
never
stay
in
the
house
when
they
were
here
no
coaxing
could
quiet
him
of
course
he
did
share
our
fear
about
their
charges
but
he
must
have
had
some
dreadful
experience
with
them
in
that
portion
of
his
life
which
is
unknown
to
us
a
plumber
was
to
him
the
devil
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
his
scheme
plumbers
were
foreordained
to
do
him
mischief
in
speaking
of
his
worth
it
has
never
occurred
to
me
to
estimate
calvin
by
the
worldly
standard
i
know
that
it
is
customary
now
when
any
one
dies
to
ask
how
much
he
was
worth
and
that
no
obituary
in
the
newspapers
is
considered
complete
without
such
an
estimate
the
plumbers
in
our
house
were
one
day
overheard
to
say
that
say
that
she
says
that
he
says
that
he
would
take
a
hundred
dollars
for
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
i
never
made
such
a
remark
and
that
so
far
as
calvin
was
concerned
there
was
no
purchase
in
money
as
i
look
back
upon
it
calvin
life
seems
to
me
a
fortunate
one
for
it
was
natural
and
unforced
he
ate
when
he
was
hungry
slept
when
he
was
sleepy
and
enjoyed
existence
to
the
very
tips
of
his
toes
and
the
end
of
his
expressive
and
tail
he
delighted
to
roam
about
the
garden
and
stroll
among
the
trees
and
to
lie
on
the
green
grass
and
luxuriate
in
all
the
sweet
influences
of
summer
you
could
never
accuse
him
of
idleness
and
yet
he
knew
the
secret
of
repose
the
poet
who
wrote
so
prettily
of
him
that
his
little
life
was
rounded
with
a
sleep
understated
his
felicity
it
was
rounded
with
a
good
many
his
conscience
never
seemed
to
interfere
with
his
slumbers
in
fact
he
had
good
habits
and
a
contented
mind
i
can
see
him
now
walk
in
at
the
study
door
sit
down
by
my
chair
bring
his
tail
artistically
about
his
feet
and
look
up
at
me
with
unspeakable
happiness
in
his
handsome
face
i
often
thought
that
he
felt
the
dumb
limitation
which
denied
him
the
power
of
language
but
since
he
was
denied
speech
he
scorned
the
inarticulate
mouthings
of
the
lower
animals
the
vulgar
mewing
and
yowling
of
the
cat
species
was
beneath
him
he
sometimes
uttered
a
sort
of
articulate
and
ejaculation
when
he
wished
to
call
attention
to
something
that
he
considered
remarkable
or
to
some
want
of
his
but
he
never
went
whining
about
he
would
sit
for
hours
at
a
closed
window
when
he
desired
to
enter
without
a
murmur
and
when
it
was
opened
he
never
admitted
that
he
had
been
impatient
by
in
though
speech
he
had
not
and
the
unpleasant
kind
of
utterance
given
to
his
race
he
would
not
use
he
had
a
mighty
power
of
purr
to
express
his
measureless
content
with
congenial
society
there
was
in
him
a
musical
organ
with
stops
of
varied
power
and
expression
upon
which
i
have
no
doubt
he
could
have
performed
scarlatti
celebrated
whether
calvin
died
of
old
age
or
was
carried
off
by
one
of
the
diseases
incident
to
youth
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
his
departure
was
as
quiet
as
his
advent
was
mysterious
i
only
know
that
he
appeared
to
us
in
this
world
in
his
perfect
stature
and
beauty
and
that
after
a
time
like
lohengrin
he
withdrew
in
his
illness
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
regretted
than
in
all
his
blameless
life
i
suppose
there
never
was
an
illness
that
had
more
of
dignity
and
sweetness
and
resignation
in
it
it
came
on
gradually
in
a
kind
of
listlessness
and
want
of
appetite
an
alarming
symptom
was
his
preference
for
the
warmth
of
a
to
the
lively
sparkle
of
the
open
woodfire
whatever
pain
he
suffered
he
bore
it
in
silence
and
seemed
only
anxious
not
to
obtrude
his
malady
we
tempted
him
with
the
delicacies
of
the
season
but
it
soon
became
impossible
for
him
to
eat
and
for
two
weeks
he
ate
or
drank
scarcely
anything
sometimes
he
made
an
effort
to
take
something
but
it
was
evident
that
he
made
the
effort
to
please
us
the
neighbors
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
advice
of
neighbors
is
never
good
for
anything
suggested
catnip
he
would
even
smell
it
we
had
the
attendance
of
an
amateur
practitioner
of
medicine
whose
real
office
was
the
cure
of
souls
but
nothing
touched
his
case
he
took
what
was
offered
but
it
was
with
the
air
of
one
to
whom
the
time
for
pellets
was
passed
he
sat
or
lay
day
after
day
almost
motionless
never
once
making
a
display
of
those
vulgar
convulsions
or
contortions
of
pain
which
are
so
disagreeable
to
society
his
favorite
place
was
on
the
brightest
spot
of
a
smyrna
rug
by
the
conservatory
where
the
sunlight
fell
and
he
could
hear
the
fountain
play
if
we
went
to
him
and
exhibited
our
interest
in
his
condition
he
always
purred
in
recognition
of
our
sympathy
and
when
i
spoke
his
name
he
looked
up
with
an
expression
that
said
understand
it
old
fellow
but
it
no
he
was
to
all
who
came
to
visit
him
a
model
of
calmness
and
patience
in
affliction
i
was
absent
from
home
at
the
last
but
heard
by
daily
of
his
failing
condition
and
never
again
saw
him
alive
one
sunny
morning
he
rose
from
his
rug
went
into
the
conservatory
he
was
very
thin
then
walked
around
it
deliberately
looking
at
all
the
plants
he
knew
and
then
went
to
the
in
the
and
stood
a
long
time
looking
out
upon
the
little
field
now
brown
and
sere
and
toward
the
garden
where
perhaps
the
happiest
hours
of
his
life
had
been
spent
it
was
a
last
look
he
turned
and
walked
away
laid
himself
down
upon
the
bright
spot
in
the
rug
and
quietly
died
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
a
little
shock
went
through
the
neighborhood
when
it
was
known
that
calvin
was
dead
so
marked
was
his
individuality
and
his
friends
one
after
another
came
in
to
see
him
there
was
no
sentimental
nonsense
about
his
obsequies
it
was
felt
that
any
parade
would
have
been
distasteful
to
him
john
who
acted
as
undertaker
prepared
a
for
him
and
i
believe
assumed
a
professional
decorum
but
there
may
have
been
the
usual
levity
underneath
for
i
heard
that
he
remarked
in
the
kitchen
that
it
was
the
wake
he
ever
everybody
however
felt
a
fondness
for
calvin
and
regarded
him
with
a
certain
respect
between
him
and
bertha
there
existed
a
great
friendship
and
she
apprehended
his
nature
she
used
to
say
that
sometimes
she
was
afraid
of
him
he
looked
at
her
so
intelligently
she
was
never
certain
that
he
was
what
he
appeared
to
be
when
i
returned
they
had
laid
calvin
on
a
table
in
an
upper
chamber
by
an
open
window
it
was
february
he
reposed
in
a
lined
about
the
edge
with
evergreen
and
at
his
head
stood
a
little
with
flowers
he
lay
with
his
head
tucked
down
in
his
arms
a
favorite
position
of
his
before
the
fire
as
if
asleep
in
the
comfort
of
his
soft
and
exquisite
fur
it
was
the
involuntary
exclamation
of
those
who
saw
him
natural
he
looks
as
for
myself
i
said
nothing
john
buried
him
under
the
twin
one
white
and
the
other
pink
in
a
spot
where
calvin
was
fond
of
lying
and
listening
to
the
hum
of
summer
insects
and
the
twitter
of
birds
perhaps
i
have
failed
to
make
appear
the
individuality
of
character
that
was
so
evident
to
those
who
knew
him
at
any
rate
i
have
set
down
nothing
concerning
him
but
the
literal
truth
he
was
always
a
mystery
i
did
not
know
whence
he
came
i
do
not
know
whither
he
has
gone
i
would
not
weave
one
spray
of
falsehood
in
the
wreath
i
lay
upon
his
grave
