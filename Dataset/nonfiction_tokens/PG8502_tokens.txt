preface
in
preparing
the
material
for
this
book
the
author
has
endeavored
to
arrange
and
discuss
the
subject
matter
in
a
way
to
be
of
the
greatest
service
and
help
to
the
agricultural
student
and
stockman
and
place
at
their
disposal
a
text
and
reference
book
the
general
discussions
at
the
beginning
of
the
different
sections
and
chapters
and
the
discussions
of
the
different
diseases
are
naturally
brief
an
effort
has
been
made
to
conveniently
arrange
the
topics
for
both
practical
and
work
the
chapters
have
been
grouped
under
the
necessary
heads
with
review
questions
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
and
the
book
divided
into
seven
parts
the
chapters
on
diseases
of
the
locomotory
organs
the
teeth
surgical
diseases
and
castration
although
not
commonly
discussed
in
books
of
this
class
the
writer
believes
will
be
of
value
for
reference
and
instructional
work
when
used
as
a
it
will
be
well
for
the
instructor
to
supplement
the
text
with
discussions
the
writer
has
given
special
emphasis
to
the
cause
and
prevention
of
disease
and
not
so
much
to
the
medicinal
treatment
stockmen
are
not
expected
to
practise
the
medicinal
treatment
but
rather
the
preventive
treatment
of
disease
for
this
reason
it
is
not
deemed
advisable
to
give
a
large
number
of
formulas
for
the
preparation
of
medicinal
mixtures
to
be
used
for
the
treatment
of
disease
but
such
treatment
is
suggested
in
the
most
necessary
cases

chapter
i
general
discussion
of
disease
disease
is
the
general
term
for
any
deviation
from
the
normal
or
healthy
condition
of
the
body
the
morbid
processes
that
result
in
either
slight
or
marked
modifications
of
the
normal
condition
are
recognized
by
the
injurious
changes
in
the
structure
or
function
of
the
organ
or
group
of
body
organs
involved
the
increase
in
the
secretion
of
urine
noticeable
in
horses
in
the
late
fall
and
winter
is
caused
by
the
cool
weather
and
the
decrease
in
the
perspiration
if
however
the
increase
in
the
quantity
of
urine
secreted
occurs
independently
of
any
normal
cause
and
is
accompanied
by
an
unthrifty
and
weakened
condition
of
the
animal
it
would
then
characterize
disease
tissues
may
undergo
changes
in
order
to
adapt
themselves
to
different
environments
or
as
a
means
of
protecting
themselves
against
injuries
the
coat
of
a
horse
becomes
heavy
and
appears
rough
if
the
animal
is
exposed
to
severe
cold
a
rough
staring
coat
is
very
common
in
horses
affected
by
disease
the
outer
layer
of
the
skin
becomes
thickened
when
subject
to
pressure
or
friction
from
the
harness
this
change
in
structure
is
purely
protective
and
normal
in
disease
the
deviation
from
normal
must
be
more
permanent
in
character
than
it
is
in
the
examples
mentioned
above
and
in
some
way
prove
injurious
to
the
body
functions
we
may
divide
diseases
into
three
classes
and
have
no
constant
cause
a
variety
of
causes
may
produce
the
same
disease
for
example
acute
indigestion
may
be
caused
by
a
change
of
diet
watering
the
animal
after
feeding
grain
by
exhaustion
and
intestinal
worms
usually
but
one
of
the
animals
in
the
stable
or
herd
is
affected
if
several
are
affected
it
is
because
all
have
been
subject
to
the
same
condition
and
not
because
the
disease
has
spread
from
one
animal
to
another
the
terms
infectious
and
contagious
are
used
in
speaking
of
specific
diseases
much
confusion
exists
in
the
popular
use
of
these
terms
a
disease
is
one
that
may
be
transmitted
by
personal
contact
as
for
example
influenza
glanders
and
as
these
diseases
may
be
produced
by
indirect
contact
with
the
diseased
animal
as
well
as
by
direct
they
are
also
there
are
a
few
germ
diseases
that
are
not
spread
by
the
healthy
animals
coming
in
direct
contact
with
the
diseased
animal
as
for
example
black
leg
and
southern
cattle
fever
these
are
purely
infectious
diseases
infection
is
a
more
comprehensive
term
than
contagion
as
it
may
be
used
in
alluding
to
all
germ
diseases
while
the
use
of
the
term
contagion
is
rightly
limited
to
such
diseases
as
are
produced
principally
through
individual
contact
are
very
common
among
domestic
animals
this
class
of
disease
is
caused
by
insects
and
worms
as
for
example
lice
mites
ticks
flies
and
round
and
flat
worms
that
live
at
the
expense
of
their
hosts
they
may
invade
any
of
the
organs
of
the
body
but
most
commonly
inhabit
the
digestive
tract
and
skin
some
of
the
parasitic
insects
mosquitoes
flies
and
ticks
act
as
secondary
hosts
for
certain
animal
microorganisms
that
they
transmit
to
healthy
individuals
through
the
punctures
or
the
bites
that
they
are
capable
of
producing
in
the
skin
for
convenience
we
may
divide
the
causes
of
disease
into
the
predisposing
or
indirect
and
the
exciting
or
direct
predisposing
are
such
factors
as
tend
to
render
the
body
more
susceptible
to
disease
or
favor
the
presence
of
the
exciting
cause
for
example
an
animal
that
is
narrow
chested
and
lacking
in
the
development
of
the
vital
organs
lodged
in
the
thoracic
cavity
when
exposed
to
the
same
condition
as
the
other
members
of
the
herd
may
contract
disease
while
the
animals
having
better
conformation
do
not
fig
hogs
confined
in
yards
and
pastures
that
are
free
from
filth
and
fed
in
pens
and
on
feeding
floors
that
are
clean
do
not
become
hosts
for
large
numbers
of
parasites
hogs
confined
in
filthy
pens
are
frequently
so
badly
infested
with
lice
and
intestinal
worms
that
their
health
and
thriftiness
are
seriously
interfered
with
in
the
first
case
mentioned
the
predisposition
to
disease
is
in
the
individual
and
in
the
second
case
it
is
in
the
surroundings

exciting
are
the
immediate
causes
of
the
particular
disease
exciting
causes
usually
operate
through
the
environment
with
the
exception
of
the
special
germs
the
most
common
exciting
causes
are
faulty
food
and
faulty
methods
of
feeding
the
following
predisposing
causes
of
disease
may
be
mentioned
is
an
important
factor
in
the
production
of
disease
young
and
immature
animals
are
more
prone
to
attacks
of
infectious
diseases
than
are
old
and
mature
animals
usually
affects
the
young
hogs
in
the
herd
first
while
scours
suppurative
joint
disease
and
infectious
sore
mouth
are
diseases
that
occur
during
the
first
few
days
or
few
weeks
of
the
animal
life
lung
and
intestinal
parasites
are
more
commonly
found
in
the
young
growing
animals
old
animals
are
prone
to
fractures
of
bones
and
degenerative
changes
of
the
body
tissues
as
a
general
rule
the
young
are
more
subject
to
acute
diseases
and
the
old
to
chronic
diseases

insanitary

surroundings
or
are
important
predisposing
factors
a
dark
crowded
poorly
ventilated
stable
lowers
the
animal
vitality
and
renders
it
more
susceptible
to
the
disease
a
few
rods
difference
in
the
location
of
stables
and
yards
may
make
a
marked
difference
in
the
health
of
the
herd
a
dry
protected
site
is
always
preferable
to
one
in
the
open
or
on
low
poorly
drained

little
shelter
but
they
do
need
dry
comfortable
quarters

cold
weather
feed
and
faulty
methods
of

very
common
causes
of
diseases
of
the
digestive
tract
and
the
nervous
system
a
change
from
dry
feed
to
a
green
succulent
ration
is
a
common
cause
of
acute
indigestion
in
both
horses
and
cattle
the
feeding
of
a
heavy
ration
of
grain
to
horses
that
are
accustomed
to
exercise
during
enforced
rest
may
cause
liver

disorders
the
feeding
of

disorders

diagnosis
and
symptoms
of
disease
the
importance
of
recognizing
or
diagnosing
the
seat
and
nature
of
the
morbid
change
occurring
in
an
organ
or
group
of
organs
can
not
be
overestimated
laymen
do
not
comprehend
the
difficulty
or
importance
of
correctly
grouping
the
signs
or
symptoms
of
disease
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
them
to
recognize
the
nature
of
the
disease
in
order
to
be
able
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
many
symptoms
or
signs
of
disease
we
must
possess
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
physiological
functions
of
the
different
organs
of
the
body
we
must
be
familiar
with
the
animal
when
it
is
in
good
health
in
order
to
be
able
to
recognize
any
deviation
from
the
normal
due
to
disease
and
we
must
learn
from
personal
observation
the
different
symptoms
that
characterize
the
different
diseases
stockmen
should
be
able
to
tell
when
any
of
the
animals
in
their
care
are
sick
as
soon
as
the
first
symptom
of
disease
manifests
itself
by
changes
in
the
general
appearance
and
behavior
but
in
order
to
ascertain
the
exact
condition
a
general
and
systematic
examination
is
necessary
the
examiner
whether
he
be
a
layman
or
a
veterinarian
must
observe
the
animal
carefully
noting
the
behavior
appearance
surroundings
and
general
and
local
symptoms
before
making
a
of
the
animal
it
is
well
if
the
examiner
is
not
already
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
case
care
feed
and
surroundings
to
learn
as
much
about
this
from
the
attendant
as
is
possible
inquiry
should
be
made
as
to
the
feeding
the
conditions
under
which
the
animal
has
been
kept
the
length
of
time
it
has
been
sick
its
actions
or
any
other
information
that
may
be
of
assistance
in
forming
the
diagnosis
and
outlining
the
treatment
the
inform
us
regarding
the
condition
of
the
different
groups
of
body
organs
a
careful
study
of
this
group
of
symptoms
enables
us
correctly
to
diagnose
disease
and
inform
ourselves
as
to
the
progress
of
long
severe
affections
these
symptoms
occur
in
connection
with
the
pulse
respirations
body
temperature
skin
and
coat
visible
mucous
membranes
secretions
and
excretions
and
behavior
of
the
animal
local
are
confined
to
a
definite
part
or
organ
swelling
pain
tenderness
and
loss
of
function
are
common
local
symptoms
a
symptom
may
also
be
considered
under
this
head
because
of
its
direct
relation
to
the
seat
of
disease
it
aids
greatly
in
forming
the
diagnosis
other
terms
used
in
describing
symptoms
of
disease
are
which
includes
all
that
can
be
recognized
by
the
person

the
use

of
the
greatest
importance
to

farmer
and

we
are
beginning
to
realize
that
one
of
the
most
important
secrets
of
profitable
and
successful
stock
raising
is
the
prevention
of
disease
that
the
agricultural
colleges
are
doing
a
great
work
in
helping
to
teach
farmers
that
there
are
right
and
wrong
methods
of
feeding
and
caring
for
animals
that
the
practice
of
sanitation
in
caring
for
animals
is
the
cheapest
method
of
treating
disease
and
that
it
is
advisable
to
practise
radical
methods
of
control
when
necessary
in
order
to
rid
the
herd
of
an
infectious
disease
ration
and
the
method
of
feeding
are
not
only
important
in
considering
the
causes
of
diseases
of
the
digestive
tract
but
diseases
of
other
organs
as
well
the
feeding
of
an
excessive
or
insufficient
quantity
of
feed
or
a
ration
that
is
too
concentrated
bulky
and
innutritious
poor
in
quality
or
spoiled
may
produce

impure
water
is
a
common
cause
of

a
deep
well
that
is
closed

does
not
insure

make
a

suitable
to
their
needs
the
selection
of
the
location
the
proportions
the
arrangement
of
the
interior
and
the
lighting
and
ventilation
there
would
be
a
great
saving
in
losses
from
disease
and
the
cost
of
building
in
many
cases
would
be
lessened
your
building
that
you
have
taken
for
your
model
may
not
be
suitable

are
a

that
may
be
used
in
the
prevention
and
control
of

some
of
these
products
such
as

enable
the
owner
to
rid
his
herds
of

bacterins
may
be
used
however
we
must
not
depend
wholly
on
these
agents
in
the
control
of
disease
we
must
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
manner
in
which
the

is
spread
for
without
this
knowledge
we
would
be
unable
to
prevent
its
dissemination
over

medicinal
the
average
stockman

is
more
familiar
with
the
treatment
of
disease
with
drugs
than
he
is
with
the
preventive
measures
just
described
this
statement
does
not
imply
that
a
knowledge
of
medicinal
therapeutics
is
not
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
treatment
of

the
ultimate

of
all

is
both
to
prevent

neither

drugs
administration
of
drugs
may
be
administered
by
the

channels
by

of
the

by
injecting
into
the
rectum
if
the
animal
is
not
too
sick
to
eat
and
the
drug
does
not
possess
an
unpleasant
taste
it
may
be
given
with
the
feed
if
soluble
it
may
be
given
with
the
drinking
water
or
in
any
case
it
may
be
mixed
with
ground
feed
if
this
method
is
to
be
preferred
in
all
cases
the
medicine
must
be
well
mixed
with
the
feed
this
is
especially
important
if
there
are
a
number
of
animals
to
be
treated
as
there
is
more
certainty
of
each
animal
getting
the
proper
dose
and
the
danger
of
overdosing
is
avoided
if
the
young
animal
is
nursing

diseases
of
the
digestive

the
organs
that
form
the
digestive
tract
are
the
mouth
pharynx
oesophagus
stomach
intestines
and
the
annexed
glands
viz
the
salivary
liver
and
pancreas
the
development
of
these
organs
differs
in
the
different
species
of
animals
for
example
solipeds
possess
a
small
simple
stomach
and
capacious
complicated
intestines
just
the
opposite
is
true
of
ruminants
the
different
species
of
ruminants
possess
a
large
complicated
stomach
and
comparatively
simple
intestines
in
swine
we
meet
with
a
more
highly
developed
stomach
than
that
of
solipeds
and
a
more
simple
intestinal
tract
of
all
domestic
animals
the
most
simple
digestive
tract
occurs
in
the
dog
these
variations
in
the
development
of
the
different
organs
of
digestion
together
with
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
feed
and
method
of
feeding
cause
a

in
the

the

of
ruminants
predispose
them
to
diseases
of
this
portion
of
the
digestive
tract
because
of
their
complicated
intestinal

solipeds
are
prone
to
intestinal
disease
diseases
of
the
mouth
general
the
mouth
is
the
first
division
of
the
digestive
tract
it
is
formed
by
the
lips
cheeks
palate
soft
palate
tongue
and
teeth
here
the
feed
is
acted
on
mechanically
it
is
broken
up
by
the
teeth
and
moved
about
until
mixed
with
the
saliva
and
put
into
condition
to
pass
through
the
pharynx
and
along
the
oesophagus
to
the
stomach
the
mechanical
change
that
the
feed
is
subject
to
is
very
imperfect
in
dogs
in
the
horse
it
is
a
slow
thorough
process
although
greedy
feeders
are
not
uncommon
the
first
mastication
in
the
ox
is
three
times
quicker
than
in
horses
but
the
process
of
rumination
is
slow
and
thorough
simple
inflammation
of
the
mouth
is
frequently
met
with
in
horses
ulcerative
or
infectious
inflammation
commonly
occurs
in
young
and
occasionally
in
old
debilitated
animals
this
form
of
sore
mouth
will
be
discussed
along
with
other
infectious
diseases
and
the
following
discussion
will
be
confined
to
the
form
of
the
disease
are
irritation
from
the

irritating
drenches
roughage
that
contains

febrile
or
digestive
disorders
or
any
condition
that
may
interfere
with

may
cause
this
disorder
in
the
latter
cases
the

different
cases
and
species
slight
or
localized
inflammation
of
the

is
usually
overlooked
by
the
attendant
lampas
of

may
be
considered
a
local
inflammation
involving
the

lacerations
of
the
cheek

tongue
by
the
teeth
or
irritating
feed
usually
result
in
a
slight
interference
with
prehension
and
mastication
and
more
or
less
salivation
salivation
from
this
cause
should
not
be
confused
with
salivation
resulting
from
feeding
on
white
clover
in
generalized
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
the
first
symptom
usually
noticed
is
the
inability
to
eat
on
examining
the
mouth
we
find
the
mucous
membrane
inflamed
hot
and
dry
a
part
may
appear
coated
in
a
short
time
the
odor
from
the
mouth
is
fetid
following
this
dry
stage
of
the
inflammation
is
the
period
of
salivation
saliva
dribbles
from
the
mouth
and
in
severe
cases
it
is
mixed
with
white
stringy
shreds
of
epithelium
and
tinged
with
blood
in
less
acute
forms
of
the
disease
we
may
notice
little
blisters
or
vesicles
scattered
over
the
lining
membrane
of
the
lips
cheeks
and
tongue
the
acute
form
of
stomatitis
runs
a
short
course
usually
a
few
days
and
responds
readily
to
treatment
localized
inflammation
caused
by
irritation
from
teeth
or
feeding
irritating
feeds
does
not
respond
so
readily
to
treatment
is
largely
preventive
and
consists
largely
in
removing
the
cause
when
the
mouth
is
inflamed
roughage
should
be
fed
rather
sparingly
and
soft
feeds
such
as
slops
mashes
or
gruels
given
in
place
of
the
regular
diet
plenty
of
clean
drinking
water
should
be
provided
in
the
way
of
medicinal
treatment
antiseptic
and
astringent

are
indicated
a

solution
of
boric
acid
may
be
used
or
a

of
a
high

should
be
thoroughly
irrigated

a
depraved
appetite
is
met
with
in
all
species
of
farm
animals
but
it
is
especially
common
in
ruminants
it
should
not
be
classed
as
a
disease
but
more
correctly
as
a
bad
habit
or
symptom
of
innutrition
or
indigestion
the
animals
affected
seem
to
have
an
irresistible
desire
to
lick
chew
and
swallow
indigestible
and
disgusting
objects
common
of
depraved
appetite
is
the
feeding
of
a
ration
deficient
in
certain
food
elements
a
ration
deficient
in
protein
or
in
salts
is
said
to
cause
this
disorder
lack
of
exercise
or
confinement
innutrition
and
a
depraved
sense
of
taste
may
favor
the
development
of
this
disease
for
example
when
sheep
are
housed
closely
they
may
contract
the
habit
of
chewing
one
another
fleeces
lambs
are
especially
apt
to
contract
this
habit
when
suckling
ewes
that
have
on
their
udders
long
wool
soiled
with
urine
and
faeces
first
is
the
desire
to
chew
lick
or
eat
indigestible
or
filthy
substances
horses
and
cattle
may
stand
and
lick
a
board
for
an
hour
or
more
cattle
may
chew
the
long
hair
from
the
tails
of
horses
sheep
may
nibble
wool
sows
may
within
a
short
time
after
giving
birth
to
their
pigs
kill
and
eat
them
chickens
may
pick
and
eat
feathers
innutrition
may
accompany
the
abnormal
appetite
as
very
frequently
the
affected
animal
shows
a
disposition
to
leave
its
feed
in
order
to
eat
these
injurious
and
innutritions
substances
in
ruminants
the
wool
or
hair
may
form
balls
and
obstruct
the
opening
into
the
third
compartment
causing
chronic
indigestion
and
death
consists
in
the
removal
of
the
cause
feeding
a
ration
that
meets
the
needs
of
the
system
clean
quarters
and
plenty
of
exercise
are
the
most
important
preventive
lines
of
treatment
in
such
cases
medicinal
treatment
saline
and
bitter
tonics
may
be
indicated
it
is
usually
advisable
to
remove
the
affected
animals
from
the
herd
or
flock
in
order
to
prevent
others
from
imitating
them
diseases

the
most
important
digestive
change
in

dangerous
to
the
health
of
the

the
feeding
of

is
highly
injurious
the

stall
that
is
well
bedded
or
a

we
should
stop
working
it
and
remove
the

usually
aggravates
the
case
and
may
cause

composed
of
the
following
organs
mouth
gullet
crop
stomach
gizzard
and
intestines
with
the
two
large
glands
the
liver
and
pancreas
the
digestion
of
the
feed
begins
in
the
crop
here
the
feed
is
held
for
a
short
time
mixed
with
certain
fluids
and
softened
on
reaching
the
stomach
it
becomes
mixed
with
the
digestive
fluid
secreted
by
the
gastric
glands
this
second
digestive
action
consists
in
thoroughly
soaking
the
feed
in
the
gastric
juice
making
it
soft
and
preparing
it
for
maceration
by
the
heavily
muscled
gizzard
following
maceration
it
passes
into
the
intestine
it
is
here
that
the
digestive
action
is
completed
and
absorption
occurs
under
the
conditions
of
domestication
poultry
are
subject
to
a
great
variety
of
intestinal
disorders
diseases
of
the
impaction
and
inflammation
are
the
two
common
diseases
of
the
crop
impacted
are
usually
caused
by
the
feeding
of
too
much
dry
feed
fermentation
of
the
contents
of
the
crop
and
foreign
bodies
that
obstruct
the
opening
from
the
organ
of
the
is
caused
by
excessive
use
of
condiments
in
the
feed
putrid
or
spoiled
feeds
and
eating
caustic
drugs
such
as
lime
and
rat
poison
are
dulness
an
indisposition
to
move
about
drooping
wings
and
efforts
to
eject
gases
and
liquids
the
crop
is
found
greatly
distended
and
either
hard
or
soft
depending
on
the
quantity
of
feed
present
and
the
cause
of
the
distention
if
fermentation
is
present
the
crop
usually
feels
soft
preventive
consists
in
practising
proper
methods
of
feeding
the
of
a
recent
case
consists
in
manipulating
the
mass
of
feed
breaking
it
up
and
forcing
it
upwards
toward
the
mouth
if
difficulty
in
breaking
up
the
mass
is
experienced
it
is
advisable
to
administer
a
tablespoonful
of
castor
oil
to
the
bird
if
the
above
manipulations
are
unsuccessful
an
operation
is
necessary
this
consists
in
making
an
opening
through
the
skin
and
the
wall
of
the
crop
and
removing
the
contents
with
tweezers
the
opening
must
be
closed
with
sutures
the
proper
aseptic
precautions
must
be
observed
in
inflammation
of
the
crop
the
bird
should
be
dieted
for
at
least
one
day
and
one
teaspoonful
of
castor
oil
given
as
a
laxative
acute
and
chronic
the
recognition
of
special
forms
of
indigestion
in
poultry
is
difficult
a
flock
of
poultry
that
is
subject
to
careless
and
indifferent
care
may
not
thrive
and
a
number
of
the
birds
develop
digestive
disorders
this
may
be
indicated
by
an
abnormal
or
depraved
appetite
and
emaciated
condition
constipation
or
diarrhoea
may
occur
in
the
more
severe
cases
the
bird
acts
dull
the
feathers
are
ruffled
and
it
moves
about
very
little
consists
in
removing
the
cause
and
giving
the
flock
a
tonic
mixture
in
the
feed
the
following
mixture
may
be
used
powdered
gentian
and
powdered
ginger
eight
ounces
of
each
glauber
salts
four
ounces
and
sulfate
of
iron
two
ounces
one
ounce
of
the
above
mixture
may
be
given
in
ten
pounds
of
feed
white
diarrhoea
of
young
white
diarrhoea
is
of
the
greatest
economic
importance
to
the
poultryman
the
loss
of
chicks
from
this
disease
is
greater
than
the
combined
loss
resulting
from
all
other
diseases
it
is
stated
by
some
authors
that
not
less
than
fifty
per
cent
of
the
chickens
hatched
die
from
white
diarrhoea
such
a
heavy
as
is
attributed
to
this
disease
can
not
result
from
improper
methods
of
handling
and
insanitary
conditions
before
it
was
proven
that
white
diarrhoea
was
caused
by
specific
germs
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
was
placed
on
such
causes
as
debilitated
breeding
stock
improper
incubation
poorly
ventilated
overcrowded
brooders
too
high
or
too
low
temperatures
and
filth
such
conditions
are
important
predisposing
factors
and
may
in
isolated
cases
result
in
serious
intestinal
disorders
microorganisms

disease
belong
to
both
the
plant

kingdoms
infection
usually
occurs
within

it
is
very
easy
to
differentiate
between
the
infectious
and
the
diarrhoea
in
the
latter
the
percentage
of

affected
is
small
and
the

responds
to

more
readily
than
does
the

the
degree
of

depends
on

v
diseases
of
the
liver
general
the
liver
is
one
of
the
most
important
glands
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
largest
because
of
its
physiological
influence
over
the
functions
of
the
kidneys
intestines
and
body
in
general
and
the
varied
functions
that
it
possesses
it
is
frequently
affected
by
functional
disorders
all
of
the
blood
that
comes
directly
from
the
intestine
is
received
by
the
liver
it
secretes
the
bile
neutralizes
many
of
the
poisonous
substances
and
end
products
of
digestion
that
are
taken
up
by
the
absorbing
vessels
of
the
intestine
and
acts
as
a
storehouse
for
the
glycogen
it
can
be
readily
understood
from
this
brief
statement
of
the
nature
of
the
liver
functions
that
any
functional
disorder
of
the
liver
may
be
far
reaching
in
its
effect
in
many
of
the
diseases
that
involve
other
organs
the
liver
may
be
primarily
affected
it
is
difficult
to
diagnose
functional
disorders
of
the
liver
that
are
responsible
for
a
diseased
condition
of
some
other
body
organ
a
knowledge
of
the
physiology
and
pathology
of
the
liver
is
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
diagnosis
of
this
class
of
disorders
in
the
larger
domestic
animals
symptoms
of
liver
diseases
are
more
obscure
than
in
the
small
animals
in
certain
parasitic
diseases
and
in
mixed
and
specific
infectious
diseases
the
liver
may
show
marked
pathological
changes
common
causes
of

domestic
animals
commonly
live
under
very
unnatural
conditions
ill

do
not
follow
unless
these
conditions
are
so
extreme
as
to
violate
practically
all
of
the
health
laws
pampered
animals
are
especially
prone
to
liver
disorders
the
feeding
of
too
heavy
and
too
concentrated
a
ration
together
with
insufficient
exercise
is
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
disorders
of
the

the
feeding
of
a
ration
that
is
unsuitable
for
that
particular
species
is
a
common
source
of
disease
in
animals
for
example
the
feeding
to
carnivora

up
largely
of
starchy
feed
and
the
feeding
of
a
ration
containing
an
excessive
quantity
of
protein
to
herbivorous
animals
may
result
in
intestinal
liver

prove
highly
injurious
catarrhal

exercise
a

and
plenty
of

as
well
as
preventing

disorders
may
be

of
all
curative
agents
laxatives

such
as

we
prefer
the
administration
of

chapter
vi
diseases
of
the
urinary
organs
general
the
urinary
apparatus
is
composed
of
two
glands
the
kidneys
and
an
excretory
apparatus
that
carries
the
excretion
of
the
kidneys
to
the
outside
the
kidneys
are
situated
in
the
superior
region
of
the
abdominal
cavity
sublumbar
above
the
peritoneum
and
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
median
line
they
are
highly
vascular
glands
somewhat
and
of
a
deep
red
color
these
glands
are
capable
of
removing
from
the
blood
a
fluid
that
is
essentially
different
in
composition
and
which
if
retained
in
the
blood
would
be
harmful
or
poisonous
to
the
body
tissues
the
kidney
excretions
are
carried
from
the
pelvis
of
the
kidneys
by
the
right
and
left
ureters
these
canals
terminate
in
the
bladder
an
reservoir
for
the
urine
this
organ
is
situated
in
the
posterior
portion
of
the
abdominal
cavity
and
at
the
entrance
to
the
pelvic
cavity
posteriorly
it
forms
a
constricted
portion
or
neck
it
is
here
that
the
urethra
originates
this
canal
represents
the
last
division
of
the
excretory
apparatus
in
the
female
the
urethra
is
short
and
terminates
in
the
vulva
in
the
male
it
is
long
and
is
supported
by
the
penis
the
urine
secreted
by
the
kidneys
is
a
body
excretion
and
consists
of
water
organic
matter
and
salts
the
nitrogenous
aromatic
compounds
coloring
matter
and
mucin
form
the
organic
matter
the
nitrogenous
and
aromatic
compounds
are
urea
uric
and
hippuric
acids
benzoic
acid
and
ethereal
sulfates
of
phenol
and
cresol
the
salts
are
sulfates
phosphates
and
chlorides
of
sodium
potassium
calcium
and
magnesium
the
organic
and
inorganic
matter
varies
with
the
ration
the
quantity
of
urine
secreted
within
a
given
time
varies
in
the
different
species
and
at
different
times
in
the
same
individual
in
the
horse
the
quantity
secreted
in
hours
varies
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pints
in
cattle
from
ten
to
forty
pints
in
sheep
from
to
one
and
pints
the
normal
color
of
the
urine
varies
in
the
horse
it
is
yellow
or
in
cattle
and
sheep
yellowish
and
in
the
dog
a
straw
yellow
the
specific
gravity
varies
with
the
quantity
secreted
and
the
ration
fed
when
the
quantity
of
urine
secreted
is
above
the
average
the
specific
gravity
is
usually
low
the
necessity
of
examining
the
in
diseases
of
the
urinary
apparatus
a
careful
examination
of
the
urine
is
very
necessary
in
order
to
be
able
to
form
a
correct
diagnosis
in
domestic
animals
it
is
impractical
to
attempt
to
determine
the
exact
amount
of
urine
passed
within
a
certain
time
but
we
can
make
a
general
estimate
of
the
quantity
passed
by
carefully
observing
the
animal
and
noting
the
condition
of
the
bedding
in
the
stall
the
sample
of
urine
to
be
examined
is
best
taken
from
urine
collected
at
different
periods
during
the
day
we
should
note
its
color
and
consistency
the
different
substances
in
the
urine
can
be
determined
only
by
determining
the
specific
gravity
testing
with
certain
chemical
reagents
and
by
making
a
microscopic
examination
of
the
sediment
normal
urine
from
the
horse
may
be
turbid
or
cloudy
and
more
or
less
slimy
because
of
the
presence
of
mucin
this
is
less
true
of
other
species
in
disease
the
color
of
the
urine
may
be
changed
to
a
pale
yellow
red
or
brown
for
example
in
congestion
of
the
kidneys
the
urine
is
light
in
color
and
rather
transparent
in
southern
cattle
fever
it
may
be
red
and
in
azoturia
it
may
be
brown
excessive
the
horse
is
the
most
common
sufferer
from
excessive
secretion
of
urine
the
most
common
are
musty
feeds
such
as
hay
grain
and
shipped
feeds
new
oats
succulent
feeds
and
acrid
plants
may
sometimes
cause
it
in
the
fall
of
the
year
when
the
season
is
changing
from
warm
to
cool
weather
and
the
horse
eliminates
less
water
from
the
body
by
way
of
the
skin
the
kidneys
may
become
more
active
and
the
quantity
of
urine
secreted
be
greatly
increased
this
however
is
a
normal
physiological
condition
and
should
not
be
confused
with
this
disease
the
first
noted
is
the
frequent
passing
of
a
large
quantity
of
urine
the
animal
drinks
more
water
than
usual
and
the
appetite
is
poor
dulness
and
a
weak
emaciated
condition
are
prominent
symptoms
death
occurs
unless
the
cause
of
the
disease
is
removed
if
the
poisonous
substance
has
been
acting
for
some
time
it
is
difficult
to
cure
the
animal
this
disease
can
be
by
eliminating
spoiled
feeds
from
the
ration
fed
to
animals
in
our
care
early
in
the
attack
the
necessary
attention
to
the
ration
and
the
feeding
of
a
clean
nourishing
ration
is
sufficient
to
correct
the
disease
the
quantity
of
water
drunk
by
the
animal
should
be
limited
complete
rest
is
indicated
laxatives
stimulants
and

congestion
and
inflammation
of
the

commonly
occur
in

pyaemia
and
influenza
the
toxic
effect
of
spoiled
feeds
impure

may
so
irritate

and
nervousness
or
extreme

may
sometimes
cause
a
congestion
of
these
organs
inflammation
of
the

is
a
common
complication
of
azoturia
irritation
from

should
be
included
among
the
causes
of
this

the
vary
in
the
different
stages
of
the
disease
during
the
period
of
active
congestion
the
quantity
of
urine
secreted
is
increased
the
scant
secretion
of
urine
dark
in
color
and
thick
or
turbid
is
suggestive
of
an
inflammation
of
the
kidneys
the
animal
moves
stiffly
the

may
be
arched
urination
is
painful
and
the

is
passed
in
very
small
amounts
the

the
pulse
strong
at
first
but
later
small
and
weak
and
the

temperature
is
elevated
on
making
a
rectal
examination
we
find
the

is
very
unfavorable
death
occurring
in
the

of
cases
in
azoturia
of
horses
and
in

the
inflammation
is
nearly
always
acute
the
color
of

its
high
specific
gravity
and
the
small
quantity
passed
are
valuable
symptoms
to
consider
in
the
recognition
of
this
disease
chronic
inflammation
generally
develops
slowly
and
may
not
give
rise
to
any
very
prominent
symptoms
at
first
preventive
of
nephritis
consists
in
careful
nursing
of
animals
affected
with
acute
infectious
diseases
a
clean
water
supply
and
avoiding
the
feeding
of
spoiled
feeds
the
is
largely
careful
nursing
the
animal
should
be
given
comfortable
quarters
and
complete
rest
chilling
of
the
skin
should
be
especially
guarded
against
by
protecting
the
body
with
heavy
blankets
and
applying
roller
bandages
to
the
limbs
when
necessary
the
diet
must
be
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
increase
the
work
of
the
kidneys
for
the
first
few
days
the
animal
should
receive
very
little
feed
or
water
later
a
sloppy
diet
of
sweet
milk
green
feed
and
mashes
should
be
fed
such
purgatives
as
aloes
and
glauber
salts
are
indicated
at
a
very
early
stage
in
the
disease
we
must
encourage
the
elimination
of
waste
products
by
way
of
the
skin
in
the
larger
animals
by
vigorous
rubbing
blanketing
and
the
administration
of
such
drugs
as
pilocarpine
if
the
animal
becomes
weak
general
and

inflammation
of
the

is
not
an
uncommon
disease
of
horses
it
is
commonly
by
retention
of

calculi
in
the

and
chilling
of
the
body
irritating
drugs
that
are
eliminated
from
the
body
in
the
urine
and
infection
of
the
bladder
by
germs
may
cause
it
are
usually
marked
the
inflammation
is
characterized
by
more
or
less
pain
depending
on
the
degree
of
the
inflammation
and
frequent
passing
of
urine
only
a
small
amount
of
urine
is
passed
at
each
attempt
and
in
severe
inflammation
it
may
contain
pus
or
blood
colicky
pains
sometimes
occur
the
pain
is
usually
manifested
by
a
stiff
straddling
gait
and
tenderness
when
pressure
on
the
bladder
is
made
by
introducing
the
hand
into
the
rectum
or
vagina
and
pressing
over
the
region
of
the
bladder
general
symptoms
such
as
elevation
in
body
temperature
and
irregular
appetite
may
be
manifested
should
be
first
directed
at
removing
the
cause
if
a
cystic
calculus
is
present
in
the
bladder
it
should
be
removed
if
the
retention
of
the
urine
is
caused
by
some
local
condition
and
this
is
very
often
the
case
in
nervous
animals
this
must
first
be
corrected
it
is
best
to
feed
green
and
soft
feeds
such
as
bran
mash
and
chopped
hay
and
if
the
animal
will
take
them
gruels
a
physic
of
castor
or
linseed
oil
should
be
given
occasionally
it
is
very
necessary
that
the
animal
be
kept
quiet
comfortable
clean
quarters
and
a
good
bed
should
be
provided
whenever
necessary
the
animal
should
be
blanketed
the
medicinal
treatment
consists
in
irrigating
the
bladder
with
antiseptic
solutions
and
administering
drugs
that
when
eliminated
by
way
of
the
urine
may
change
its
composition
and
render
it
less

the
following
mixture
may
be
given
potassium
chlorate
two
ounces
salol
ounce
and
powdered
nux
vomica
one

this
mixture
may
be
divided
into
sixteen
powders
one
of
the
powders
should
be
given
with

diseases
of
the
generative
organs
general
the
study
of
the
organs
concerned
with
the
reproduction
of
the
species
is
essential
in
order
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
their
several
functions
it
is
only
through
an
understanding
of
these
functions
that
we
can
prepare
ourselves
to
correctly
recognize
and
successfully
treat
or
prevent
such
diseases
as
may
involve
the
organs
of
generation
a
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
function
of
the
generative
organs
of
the
female
is
of
greater
importance
from
the
standpoint
of
disease
than
is
a
similar
knowledge
of
the
generative
organs
of
the
male
the
female
is
concerned
with
the
complete
reproductive
process
which
may
be
divided
into
four
stages
these
are
and
the
male
is
concerned
only
with
and
of
the
ovum
by
the
spermatozoa
while
the
female
must
protect
and
nourish
the
embryo
and
foetus
until
it
has
become
sufficiently
developed
to
live
independently
of
the
protection
and
nourishment
afforded
it
within
the
womb
when
the
final
stage
of
gestation
is
reached
birth
or
the
act
of
parturition
occurs
genital
organs
of
the
the
female
generative
organs
are
the
ovaries
fallopian
tubules
uterus
vagina
vulva
and
mammary
glands
are
analogous
to
the
testicles
of
the
male
their
function
is
to
secrete
ova
this
pair
of
glands
is
suspended
from
the
superior
region
sublumbar
of
the
abdominal
cavity
by
folds
of
the
lining
membrane
leading
from
the
ovaries
but
connected
with
the
surface
of
these
glands
only
during
the
period
of
oestrum
or

the
fallopian
tubules
their
function
is
to
carry
the
ovum
from
the
ovaries
to
the
uterus

we
may
divide
the
womb
into
three
divisions
cornua
body
and
cervix
the
cornua
or
horns
are
long
and
cylindrical
in
shape
this
portion
of
the
womb
is
greatly
developed
in
animals
like

that
give
birth
to
several
young
in

contains
one
or
several
foetuses
and
the
body
as

more
vascular
the
body
is
short
in
all
domestic
animals
and
connects
the
horns
with
the
cervix

the
latter
is
represented
by

continuous
with
the
vagina
this
passage
is
about
six
inches
long
in
the
larger

the
different
features
that

be
noted
are
the
clitoris
a

does
not
always
follow

of
the
male
and

impotency
in
the
male
and
sterility
in
the
female
frequently
occur
are
quite
varied
a
normal
copulation
may
be
impossible
because
of
injuries
to
and
deformities
of
the
parts
and
tumor
growths
deformed
genital
organs
and
obstructions
of
the
os
by
growths
and
scar
tissue
are
causes
of
sterility
in
the
female
failure
to
breed
is
commonly
caused
by
faulty
methods
of
feeding
and
care
and
insufficient
exercise
may
result
in
the
body
tissues
becoming
loaded
with
fat
this
may
cause
a
temporary
sterility
but
if
persisted
in
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
show
animals
the
sterility
becomes
permanent
because
of
the
genital
glands
failing
to
secrete
ova
and
spermatozoa
or
the
lack
of
vitality
of
the
male
and
female
elements
old
age
and
debility
from
disease
or
poor
care
may
induce
loss
of
sexual
desire
and
an
absence
of
or
weakened
spermatozoa
in
the
seminal
fluid
the
refusal
of
the
male
to
serve
certain
females
is
sometimes
noted
tuberculosis
may
affect
the
ovaries
and
cause
permanent
sterility
in
inflammation
of
the
lining
membrane
of
the
womb
and
vagina
the
secretions
are
abnormal
and
may
collect
in
the
womb
and
the
passages
leading
to
it
these
secretions
destroy
the
vitality
of
the
spermatozoa
and
this
condition
may
be
considered
a
common
cause
of
sterility
in
the
larger
animals
many
vigorous
young
males
are
made
impotent
by
excessive
copulation
the
excessive
use
of
the
male
at
any
time
may
result
in
failure
to
impregnate
a
large
percentage
of
the
females
that
he
serves
barren
females
do
not
become
pregnant
after
frequent
intercourse
with
the
male
young
sterile
females
may
not
come

sometimes
unnatural
periods
of
heat
are
manifested
the
animal
coming
in
heat
frequently
or
remaining
in
heat
for
a
longer
period
than
usual
this
sometimes
occurs
in
tuberculosis
of
the
ovaries
in
chronic
inflammation
of
the
maternal
passage
there
is
more
or
less
discharge
from
the
vulva
both
sexes
may
be
overly
fat
or
weakened
and
debilitated
by
disease
deformity
of
the
generative
organs
and
growths
may
be
found
on
making
an
examination
absence
of
or
lack
of
vitality
of
the
spermatozoa
may
be
determined
by
microscopic
examination
of
the
seminal
fluid
is
largely
preventive
it
is
very
important
that
breeding
animals
be
kept
in
proper
physical
condition
by
avoiding
the
feeding
of
too
heavy
or
too
light
a
ration
and
allowing
them
sufficient
exercise
the
male
is
more
often
affected
by
the
latter
cause

this
is
because
the
average
stockman
does
not
consider
exercise
given
under
the
right
conditions
an
important
factor
in
maintaining
the
vigor
of
the
male
young
males
should
not
be
given
excessive
intercourse
with
the
female
such
practice
is
certain
to
seriously
affect
the
potency
of
the
animal
the
excessive
use
of
the
stallion
can
be
avoided
by
practising
artificial
impregnation
of
a
part
of
the
mares
that
he
is
called
to
serve
sterility
caused
by
growths
and
closure
of
the
os
may
be
corrected
by
an
operation
chronic
inflammation
of
the

should
be
treated
by
irrigating
the
parts
with
a
one
per
cent
warm
water
solution
of
lysol
or
liquor
cresolis
compound
the
parts
should
be

should
be
subjected
to
a
rigid
diet
and
given

following
this
treatment
a
stimulating
ration
may
be
fed
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
the

most
highly
recommended
for
increasing
the

signs
of
the
signs
which
characterize
pregnancy
are
numerous
and
varied
for
convenience
we
may
classify
the
many
signs
of
pregnancy
under
two
heads
probable
and
positive
under
the
head
of
probable
signs
we
may
group
the
following
symptoms
of
pregnancy
cessation
of
heat
changes
in
the
animal
disposition
increase
in
the
volume
of
the
abdomen
and
tendency
to
put
on
fat
the
positive
signs
are
the
change
in
the
volume
of
the
udder
the
secretion
of
milk
the
movement
of
the
foetus
and
presence
of
the
foetus
in
the
womb
as
determined
by
rectal
examination
or
by
the
feel
of
the
abdomen
probable
are
not
reliable
and
should
be
considered
only
in
connection
with
some
positive
sign
persons
who
base
their
opinion
of
the
condition
of
an
animal
that
is
supposed
to
be
pregnant
on
probable
signs
are
frequently
mistaken
it
has
frequently
happened
that
animals
whose
condition
was
not
at
all
certain
have
given
birth
to
young
without
giving
rise
to
what
may
be
termed
characteristic
probable
signs
the
earliest
probable
symptom
is
the
cessation
of
heat
in
the
large
pregnant
animals
irregular
heat
periods
may
occur
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
we
may
safely
consider
the
animal
impregnated
if
several
heat
periods
are
passed
over
it
has
been
generally
observed
that
the
disposition
of
the
pregnant
animal
is
changed
they
become
more
quiet
and
less
nervous
and
irritable
the
tendency
of
pregnant
animals
to
put
on
fat
is
frequently
taken
advantage
of
by
the
stockman
who
may
allow
the
boar
to
run
with
the
herd
during
the
latter
period
of
fattening
the
increase
in
the
volume
of
the
abdomen
may
be
considered
a
sign
of
pregnancy
in
the
small
animals
but
in
the
mare
and
cow
it
can
not
be
depended
on
animals
that
are
pregnant
for
the
first
time
do
not
show
as
great
an
increase
in
the
volume
of
the
abdomen
as
do
animals
that
have
gone
through
successive
pregnant
periods
the
volume
of
the
abdomen
may
vary
greatly
in
the
different
individuals
and
can
not
be
depended
on
as
a
positive
indication
of
pregnancy
during
the
first
of
the
period
of
pregnancy
in
the
larger
domestic
animals
comparatively
early
in
pregnancy
the
presence
of
a
foetus
can
be
determined
by
feeling
the
uterus
through
the
wall
of
the
rectum
in
the
small
domestic
animals
the
feeling
of
the
abdomen
gives
the
best
results
in
the
cow
this
method
of
diagnosis
is
practised
during
the
latter
periods
of
pregnancy
the
examiner
stands
with
his
back
toward
the
animal
head
and
on
the
right
side
of
the
cow
and
the
left
side
of
the
mare
the
palm
of
the
hand
is
applied
against
the
abdominal
wall
about
eight
or
ten
inches
in
front
of
the
stifle
and
just
below
the
flank
moderate
pressure
is
used
and
if
a
hard
voluminous
mass
is
felt
or
if
the
foetus
moves
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
animal
is
pregnant
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
foetus
to
show
some
movement
in
the
morning
or
after
the
animal
drinks
freely
of
cold
water
the
increase
in
the
volume
of
the
udder
occurs
at
a
comparatively
early
period
in
animals
that
are
pregnant
for
the
first
time
the
secretion
of
milk
and
the
dropping
of
the
muscles
of
the
quarters
indicate
that
parturition
is
near
the
abderhalden
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
an
animal
is
pregnant
is
now
practised
hygiene
of
pregnant
pregnant
animals
that
are
confined
in
a
pasture
that
is
free
from
injurious
weeds
and
not
too
rough
or
hilly
and
where
the
animals
have
access
to
clean
water
and
the
necessary
shelter
seldom
suffer
from
an
abnormal
birth
here
they
live
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
for
taking
exercise
securing
a
suitable
diet
and
avoiding
injury
it
may
not
be
possible
in
managing
breeding
animals
to
provide
such
surroundings
at
all
times
but
we
should
observe
every
possible
hygienic
precaution
especially
if
the
animal
has
reached
the
later
periods
of
pregnancy
all
pregnant
animals
are
inclined
to
be
lazy
but
if
permitted
will
take
the
necessary
exercise
pregnant
mares
are
usually
worked
such
exercise
does
no
harm
providing
the
work
is
not
hard
or
of
an
unusual
character
cows
are
usually
subject
to
more
natural
conditions
than
other
domestic
animals
protecting
pregnant
animals
against
injuries
resulting
from
crowding
slipping
and
fighting
is
an
important
part
of
their
care
injuries
from
crowding
together
in
the
sleeping
quarters
and
about
or
through
doors
and
climbing
over
low
partitions
are
common
causes
of
injury
in
pregnant
sows
crowding
together
in
the
stable
or
yard
or
through
doorways
fighting
and
slipping
on
floors
or
icy
places
sometimes
results
in
injury
it
is
rare
however
for
cows
to
abort
from
an
injury
but
parturition
may
not
be
completely
free
from
disagreeable
complications
under
the
conditions
mentioned
retention
of
the
fetal
membranes
is
common
ewes
frequently
suffer
from
too
close
confinement
during
late
winter
sows
are
often
subject
to
the
most
unhygienic
conditions
this
is
shown
in
the
heavy
in
sows
and
pigs
during
the
late
winter
and
early
spring
the
conditions
may
be
such
as
not
to
permit
of
exercise
stormy
snowy
muddy
weather
is
common
at
this
season
of
the
year
persons
caring
for
ewes
and
sows
should
see
that
they
take
sufficient
exercise
it
may
be
necessary
to
drive
them
about
for
a
short
time
each
day
at
such
times
it
may
be
advisable
to
give
them
a
laxative
dose
of
oil
or
give
a
laxative
with
the
feed
when
there
is
any
indication
of
constipation
this
should
be
practised
pregnant
animals
should
be
fed
carefully
we
may
feed
animals
that
are
not
in
this
condition
in
a
careless
fashion
but
if
pregnant
the
feeding
of
a
fattening
ration
or
spoiled
feed
and
sudden
changes
in
the
feed
can
not
be
practised
with
any
degree
of
safety
a
bulky
ration
of
dry
feed
and
drinking
impure
or
too
little
water
may
cause
constipation
acute
indigestion
and
abortion
the
ration
fed
should
contain
the
necessary
inorganic
and
organic
elements
for
the
building
up
of
the
body
tissues
of
the
foetus
at
the
end
of
the
parturition
period
separate
quarters
should
be
provided
the
mare
or
cow
should
be
given
a
comfortable
clean
stall
away
from
the
other
animals
the
ewe
should
be
provided
with
a
warm
room
if
the
weather
is
cold
it
is
always
best
to
give
the
sow
a
separate
pen
that
is
dry
and
clean
and
away
from
the
other
animals
all
danger
from
injury
to
the
mother
and
young
should
be
guarded
against
the
expulsion
of
the
foetus
at
any
time
during
the
period
of
gestation
when
it
is
not
sufficiently
developed
to
live
independently
of
the
mother
is
termed
abortion
abortion
may
be
either
or
accidental
abortion
is
more
commonly
met
with
in
the
mare
and
sow
than
the
infectious
form
in
ruminants
the
opposite
holds
true
causes
of
accidental
are
faulty
methods
of
feeding
and
care
injuries
acute
indigestion
mouldy
spoiled
feeds
chilling
resulting
from
exposure
and
drinking
water
nervousness
brought
on
by
fright
or
excitement
and
general
diseases
are
the
common
causes
of
abortion
is
most
common
in
cows
other
domestic
animals
that
may
be
affected
are
the
mare
sow
and
ewe
is
by
a
specific
germ
the
of
bang
is
the
cause
of
abortion
in
cows
but
the
specific
germ
that
produces
abortion
in
other
species
of
animals
has
not
been
proven
in
this
country
keer
good
giltner
and
others
have
proven
that
the
bang
bacillus
of
abortion
is
infectious
for
other
species
of
animals
and
outbreaks
of
this
disease
have
been
said
to
occur
among
breeding
ewes
pastured
and
fed
on
infected
premises
its
infectiousness
for
the
females
of
other
species
has
never
been
proven
in
natural
outbreaks
the
germs
are
present
in
the
body
of
the
foetus
the
fetal
membranes
the
discharge
from
the
maternal
passages
the
faeces
and
milk
of
aborting
animals
the
male
may
carry
the
infection
in
the
sheath
urethra
and
on
the
penis
the
natural
avenues
of
infection
are
the
maternal
passages
and
digestive
tract
it
is
very
seldom
that
abortion
is
carried
from
one
herd
to
another
by
means
other
than
through
the
breeding
of
animals
free
from
abortion
to
animals
affected
by
this
disease
the
purchase
of
a
bull
or
cow
from
an
infected
herd
and
breeding
them
to
animals
that
are
free
from
disease
is
a
common
method
of
spreading
the
disease
after
serving
the
diseased
animal
the
male
may
carry
the
bacillus
of
abortion
into
the
maternal
passages
of
the
next
cow
he
serves
there
are
numerous
cases
on
record
where
the
bull
was
a
permanent
carrier
of
the
bacillus
abortus
and
infected
nearly
every
animal
served
the
distribution
of
the
disease
in
the
herd
following
the
introduction
of
a
cow
sow
or
ewe
that
has
aborted
before
or
after
being
purchased
takes
place
through
contact
of
the
other
animals
with
the
virus
that
may
be
present
on
the
floor
or
in
the
manure
or
by
taking
the
virus
into
the
digestive
tract
along
with
the
feed
and
drinking
water
experimental
evidence
indicates
the
latter
avenue
of
infection
the
stallion
is
the
most
common
source
of
infectious
abortion
in
mares
an
infected
stallion
may
distribute
the
disease
to
a
large
percentage
of
the
mares
that
he
serves
for
this
reason
nearly
all
of
the
mares
in
a
certain
locality
may
abort
in
case
the
infection
occurs
at
the
time
of
service
the
abortion
usually
takes
place
during
the
first
half
of
the
period
of
pregnancy
cows
that
become
pregnant
without
recovering
from
the
inflammation
of
the
lining
membrane
of
the
genital
tract
may
abort
at
a
very
early
period
mcfadyean
and
stockman
from
the
artificially
inoculated
cases
of
infectious
abortion
in
cows
showed
that
the
period
of
incubation
averaged
days
symptoms
of
accidental
are
extremely
variable
animals
that
abort
during
the
early
periods
of
pregnancy
may
show
so
little
disturbance
that
the
animal
can
be
treated
as
if
nothing
had
happened
during
the
latter
half
of
pregnancy
and
especially
when
the
accident
is
caused
by
an
injury
the
symptoms
are
more
serious
loss
of
appetite
dulness
restlessness
abdominal
pain
and
haemorrhage
are
the
symptoms
commonly
noted
if
the
foetus
is
dead
it
may
be
necessary
to
assist
the
animal
in
expelling
it
in
the
latter
case
death
of
the
mother
may
occur
a
slight
falling
of
the
flanks
swelling
of
the
lips
of
the
vulva
and
a
retention
of
the
fetal
membranes
or
discharge
from
the
vulva
may
be
the
only
symptoms
noted
at
the
time
abortion
occurs
symptoms
of
infectious
vary
in
the
different
periods
of
pregnancy
at
an
early
period
the
foetus
may
be
passed
with
so
little
evidence
of
labor
that
the
animal
pays
little
attention
to
it
the
recurrence
of
heat
may
be
the
first
intimation
of
the
abortion
all
cases
of
abortion
are
followed
by
more
or
less
discharge
from
the
vulva
this
is
especially
true
if
the
fetal
membranes
are
retained
in
such
cases
the
discharge
has
a
very
disagreeable
odor
in
most
cases
the
foetus
is
dead
when
born
alive
it
is
weak
and
puny
and
usually
dies
or
is
destroyed
within
a
few
days
when
the
attendant
fails
to
give
the
animal
the
necessary
attention
or
is
careless
in
his
manipulation
of
the
parts
inflammation
of
the
womb
caused
by
the
decomposition
of
the
retained
membranes
or
the
introduction
of
irritating
germs
on
the
ropes
instruments
and
hands
may
occur
death
commonly
follows
this
complication
it
is
very
important
that
the
infectious
form
be
diagnosed
early
in
the
outbreak
for
all
practical
purposes
we
are
justified
in
diagnosing
infectious
abortion
if
several
animals
in
the
herd
abort
especially
if
it
follows
the
introduction
of
new
animals
methods
of
serum
diagnosis
the
agglutination
and
tests
are
now
used
in
the
diagnosis
of
this
disease
preventive
of
the
accidental
form
consists
in
avoiding
conditions
that
may
result
in
this
accident
pregnant
animals
should
not
be
exposed
to
injuries
from
other
animals
or
from
the
surroundings
animals
which
show
a
predisposition
to
abort
should
not
be
bred
we
should
see
that
all
animals
receive
the
necessary
exercise
and
a
proper
ration
if
the
animal
indicates
by
her
actions
that
abortion
may
take
place
we
should
give
her
comfortable
quiet
quarters
it
is
very
necessary
to
keep
her
quiet
and
if
restless
morphine
may
be
given
a
very
light
diet
should
be
fed
and
constipation
prevented
by
administering
a
laxative
the
necessary
attention
should
be
given
in
case
abortion
occurs
the
enforcement
of
or
is
very
important
in
the
control
of
infectious
abortion
this
is
especially
true
of
breeding
herds
and
dairy
cows
breeders
do
not
recognize
the
importance
of
keeping
their
herds
clean
or
free
from
disease
it
is
a
fact
among
stockmen
that
abortion
and
other
infectious
diseases
have
been
frequently
introduced
into
the
herd
through
the
purchase
of
one
or
more
breeding
animals
because
of
the
prevalence
of
infectious
abortion
among
cows
it
is
advisable
to
subject
newly
purchased
breeding
animals
or
a
cow
that
has
been
bred
outside
of
the
herd
to
a
short
quarantine
period
before
allowing
them
to
mix
with
the
herd
the
breeding
of
cows
from
neighboring
herds
to
the
herd
bull
is
not
a
safe
practice
in
communities
where
there
are
outbreaks
of
this
disease
animals
that
abort
or
show
indications
of
aborting
should
be
quarantined
for
a
period
of
from
two
to
three
months
the
separation
from
the
herd
should
be
so
complete
as
to
eliminate
any
danger
of
carrying
the
disease
to
the
healthy
animals
on
the
clothing
and
farm
tools
if
this
method
of
control
were
practised
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
outbreaks
the
disease
could
be
checked
in
the
large
majority
of
herds
the
foetus
and
membranes
should
be
destroyed
by
burning
in
case
the
animal
does
not
pass
the
fetal
membranes
they
should
be
completely
removed
in
the
cow
it
is
advisable
to
wait
hours
before
doing
this
the
animal
stall
should
be
thoroughly
cleaned
and
disinfected
it
is
very
advisable
to
give
the
entire
stable
a
thorough
disinfecting
for
this
purpose
a
three
or
four
per
cent
water
solution
of
liquor
cresolis
compound
may
be
used
it
is
advisable
to
apply
it
with
a
spray
pump
the
floor
and
feed
troughs
should
be
sprinkled
daily
with
the
disinfectant
all
manure
should
be
removed
to
a
place
where
the
animals
can
not
come
in
contact
with
it
it
is
not
advisable
to
confine
the
cows
to
a
small
yard
the
more
range
they
have
the
easier
it
is
to
control
the
disease
is
very
necessary
in
infectious
abortion
the
mucous
lining
of
the
womb
and
the
passages
leading
to
it
become
inflamed
this
should
be
treated
by
irrigating
the
parts
with
a
warm
water
solution
of
a
disinfectant
that
is
this
treatment
should
be
repeated
daily
for
a
period
of
from
two
to
four
weeks
we
must
be
very
careful
not
to
irritate
the
parts

develops
there
is
a
corresponding
development
of
the
muscular
wall
of

the
last
period
of
pregnancy
is
characterized
by
the
relaxation
of
the
muscles
and
ligaments
that
form
the
pelvic
walls
and
a
relaxation
and
dilation
of
the
maternal
passages
in

degenerative
changes
occur
in
the
structures
that
attach
the
foetus
to
the

the
normal

degeneration
this

irritating

these

and
its
position
are
the
most
important
factors
for
the
veterinarian
and
stockman
to
consider
fig
on
leaving
the

the
foetus
passes
into
the
vagina
and
vulva
this
portion
of
the
maternal
passages
is
situated
in
the
pelvic
cavity
which
continues
the
abdominal
cavity
posteriorly
the
pelvic
walls
are
formed
by
bones
and
ligaments
that
are
covered
by
heavy
muscles
as
previously
mentioned
the
ligaments
and
muscles
relax
toward
the
end
of
pregnancy
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
passage
of
the
foetus
before
entering
the
pelvis
it
is
necessary
for
the
foetus
to
be
forced
through
the
inlet
to
this
cavity
this
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
birth
as
the
bones
that
form
the
framework
of
the
pelvis
completely
enclose
the
entrance
to
it
it
is
only
in
the
young
mother
that
the
pelvic
bones
give
way
slightly
to
the
pressure
on
them
by
the
foetus
it
can
be
readily
understood
that
when
the

is
large
in
proportion
to
the
diameter
of

it
is
difficult

it
may
also
occur
if
the

is

too
fattening
a
ration
and
not
permitted
sufficient
exercise
the
part
of
the
foetus
that
presents
itself
for
entrance
into
the
pelvic
cavity
and
its
position
are
of
the
greatest
importance
in
giving
birth
to
the
young
either
end
of
the
foetus
or
its
middle
portion
may
be
presented
for

the
and
may
be
modified
by
the
position
that
the

assumes
it
may
be
in
a
position
that
places
the
back
or
vertebrae
opposite
the
upper
portion
of
the
inlet
or
the
floor
or
sides
of
the
pelvic
cavity
these
positions
may
be
modified
by
the
position
of
one
or
both
limbs
or
the
head
and
neck
being
directed
forwards
instead
of
backwards
in
the
the
back

the
feet

may
show
three
positions

may
be
opposite
the
upper
walls
of
the
inlet
the
foetus
assuming
a
position
or
it
may
lie
on
either
side
in
order
to
overcome
the
friction
between
the

these

lubricated
by
the

that
escape

is
generally
easy
in

it
may
be

it
is
of
the
greatest
economic
importance
that
special

it
may
be
well
forward

may
be
directed
backwards
or
one
or
more
of
these

may
be
directed
forward
in
such
a
position
as
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
foetus
into
the
pelvic
inlet
sometimes
the
foetus
is
in
a
transverse
position
the
parts
that
present
themselves
at
the

should
be
carefully
examined
and
their
position
determined
the
necessary
assistance
should
then
be
given
any
delay
in

may
result
in
the
death
of

there
is
no
line
of
veterinary
work
that
requires
the
attention
of
a
skilled
veterinarian
more
than
assisting
an
irregular

must
guard
against
infecting
the

by
an
unusually
large

the
forefeet

are
jammed
tightly
in

the
progress
of

maternal
passages
is
retarded

using
sufficient
force
we
may
succeed
in
delivering
the

by
pulling
on
one
limb
until
the
shoulder
has
entered

repeating
this
with
the
opposite
limb
we
are
able

to
injury
it
may
be
necessary
to
change
an
abnormal
presentation
or
position
to
a
normal
presentation
or
as
nearly
normal
as
possible
this
should
be
done
before
any
attempt
is
made
to
remove
the
foetus
following
birth
the
mother
should
not
be
unnecessarily
disturbed
the
quarters
should
be
clean

bedded
and
ventilated
but
free
from
draughts
if
the
parturition
has
been
normal
a
small
quantity
of
easily
digested
feed
may
be
fed
if
weak

feverish
feed
should
be
withheld
for
at

twelve
hours
the

be
rested
for
a
few
weeks
the
young
needs
no
special
attention
if
it
is
strong
and
vigorous
but
if
weak
it
may
be
necessary
to
support
it
while
nursing
or
milk
the
mother
and
feed
it
by
hand
if
the
mother
is
nervous
and
irritable
it
may
be
necessary
to
remove
the
young

a
place
where
she
can
hear

until
a
time
when
she
can
be
induced
to
care

the
principal
attention
required
for
young
pigs
is
protection
against

that
attaches
the

fig
it
is
by
means
of
this
vascular
apparatus
that
the
foetus
is
furnished
with
nourishment
the
fetal
and
maternal
placentas
are
made
up
of
vascular
villi
and
depressions
that
are
separated
only
by
the
thin
walls
of
capillaries
and
a
layer
of
epithelial
cells
this
permits
a
change
of

circulation
the
arrangement
of
the
placenta
differs
in
the
different
species
in

the
villi
are
diffused
in
ruminants
the
villi
are
grouped
at
certain
points
these
vascular
masses
are
termed
cotyledons
the

period
the
attachments
between

placentulae
undergo

separate
this
results
in
contractions
of
the
muscular
wall
of
the

the
expulsion
of

this
complication
is
most
commonly
met
with
in
the

the
of

is
commonly
due
to

the
latter
symptom
is
especially
prominent
if

retention
of
the
fetal
membranes
is
a
very
common
cause
of
leucorrhoea
consists
in
removing
the
fetal
envelopes
before
there
is
any
opportunity
for

this
should
be
practised

animals
from
one
to
hours
in
warm
stables
and
during
the
warm
weather
treatment
should
not
be
postponed
later
than
hours
the
only
successful
method
of
treatment
is
to
introduce
the
hand
and
arm
into
the
uterus
and
break
down
the
attachments
with
the
fingers
in
the
larger
animals
the
use
of
the
arm
must
not
be
interfered
with
by
clothing
every
possible
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
infection
of
the
genital
organs
with
irritating
germs
it
is
advisable
in
most
cases
to
flush
out
the
womb
with
a
one
per

water
solution
of
liquor
cresolis
compound
after
the
removal
of

the
most
serious

extensive
inflammation
this
form
of
inflammation
may
spread
from

diseases
of
the
respiratory
apparatus
general
the
respiratory
apparatus
may
be
divided
into
two
groups
of
organs
anterior
and
posterior
the
anterior
group
the
nasal
cavities
pharynx
and
is
situated
in
the
region
of
the
head
and
neck
the
posterior
group
the
and
is
situated
in
the
chest
or
thoracic
cavity
are
the
anterior
openings
of
the
air
passages
the
nasal
cavities
are
situated
in
the
anterior
region
of
the
head
and
extend
the
entire
length
of
the
face
each
cavity
is
divided
into
three
long
narrow
passages
by
the
two
pairs
of
turbinated
bones
the
lining
membrane
is
the
nasal
mucous
membrane
the
lower
or
respiratory
portion
differing
from
the
upper
in
that
the
latter
possesses
the
nerve
endings
of
the
olfactory
nerve
and
is
the
seat
of
smell
the
five
pairs
of
head
sinuses
communicate
with
the
nasal
cavities
posteriorly
and
near
the
superior
extremity
of
the
nasal
passages
are
two
large
openings
the
guttural
that
open
into
the
pharyngeal
cavity
is
a
somewhat
cavity
the
walls
are
thin
and
formed
by
muscles
and
mucous
membrane
this
is
the
between
the
digestive
and
respiratory
passages
in
the
posterior
portion
of
the
cavity
there
are
two
openings
the
inferior
opening
leads
to
the
larynx
and
the
superior
one
to
the
oesophagus
all
feed
on
its
way
to
the
stomach
must
pass
over
the
opening
into
the
larynx
it
is
impossible
however
for
the
feed
to
enter
this
opening
unless
accidentally
when
the
animal
coughs
the
cartilage
closing
this
opening
is
pressed
shut
by
the
base
of
the
tongue
when
the
bolus
of
feed
is
passed
back
and
into
the
oesophageal
opening
may
be
compared
to
a
box
open
at
both
ends
the
several
cartilages
that
form
it
are
united
by
ligaments
it
is
lined
by
a
mucous
membrane
the
posterior
extremity
is
united
to
the
first
cartilaginous
ring
of
the
trachea
the
anterior
opening
is
closed
by
the
epiglottis
just
within
is
a
opening
that
is
limited
laterally
by
the
folds
of
the
laryngeal
mucous
membrane
the
vocal
chords
is
a
cylindrical
tube
originating
at
the
posterior
extremity
of
the
larynx
and
terminating
within
the
chest
cavity
at
a
point
just
above
the
heart
in
the
right
and
left
bronchial
tubes
it
is
formed
by
a
series
of
cartilaginous
rings
joined
together
at
their
borders
by
ligaments
and
lined
by
a
mucous
membrane
bronchial
resemble
the
trachea
in
structure
they
enter
the
lungs
a
short
distance
from
their
origin
where
they
subdivide
into
branches
and
gradually
decreasing
in
calibre
and
losing
the
cartilaginous
rings
ligaments
and
muscular
layer
until
only
the
thin
mucous
membrane
is
left
they
become
capillary
in
diameter
and
finally
open
into
the
infundibula
of
the
air
cells
of
the
lungs
take
up
all
of
the
space
in
the
thoracic
cavity
not
occupied
by
the
heart
and
oesophagus
this
cavity
resembles
a
cone
in
shape
that
is
cut
obliquely
downwards
and
forward
at
its
base
the
base
is
formed
by
the
diaphragm
which
is
pushed
forward
at
its
middle
it
is
lined
by
the
pleura
a
serous
membrane
that
is
inflected
from
the
wall
over
the
different
organs
within
the
cavity
the
median
folds
of
the
pleura
divide
the
cavity
into
right
and
left
portions
a
second
method
of
describing
the
arrangement
of
the
pleura
is
to
state
that
it
forms
two
sacks
right
and
left
that
enclose
the
lungs
the
lungs
are
the
essential
organs
of
respiration
the
tissue
that
forms
them
is
light
will
float
in
water
is
elastic
and
somewhat
each
lung
is
divided
into
lobes
and
each
lobe
into
a
great
number
of
lobules

the
supporting
connective
tissue
the
lobule
is
the
smallest
division
of
the
lung
and
is
formed
by
capillary
bronchial
tubes
air
cells
and
it
is
here
that
the
external
respiration
or
the
exchange
of
gases
between
the
capillaries
and
the
air
cells
occurs
it
is
agreed
by
all
persons
who
have
investigated
the
subject
that
unventilated
stable
air
is
injurious
to
animals
at
one
time
it
was
believed
that
the
injurious
effects
resulting
from
the
breathing
of
air
charged
with
gases
and
moisture
from
the
expired
air
and
the
surroundings
were
due
to
a
deficiency
in
oxygen
it
is
now
believed
that
the
are
mainly
due
to
the
stagnation
of
air
the
humid
atmosphere
and
the
irritating
gases
emanating
from
the
body
excretions
the
common
impurities
found
in
are
carbonic
and
ammonia
gas
moisture
charged
with
injurious
matter
and
dust
from
the
floor
and
bodies
of
the
animals
as
a
rule
the
more
crowded
and
filthy
the
stable
the
more
impurities
there
are
in
the
air
if
any
of
the
animals
are
affected
with
an
infectious
disease
such
as
tuberculosis
or
glanders
the
moisture
and
dust
may
act
as
carriers
of
the
germs
infectious
diseases
spread
rapidly
in
crowded
poorly
ventilated
stables
the
two
factors
responsible
for
this
rapid
spread
of
disease
are
the
lowered
vitality
of
the
animal
due
to
breathing
the
vitiated
air
and
the
greater
opportunity
for
infection
because
of
the
comparatively
large
number
of
bacteria
present
in
the
air
purpose
of
stable
is
to
replace
the
stable
air
with
purer
air
the
frequency
with
which
the
air
in
the
stable
should
be
changed
depends
on
the
cubic
feet
of
air
space
provided
for
each
animal
and
the
sanitary
conditions
present
the
principal
factor
in
stable
ventilation
is
the
force
of
the
wind
in
cold
weather
it
is
very
difficult
to
properly
ventilate
a
crowded
stable
without
too
much
loss
of
animal
heat
and
creating
draughts
for
practical
purposes
the
of
in
a
stable
can
be
determined
by
the
odor
of
the
air
the
amount
of
moisture
present
and
the
temperature
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
air
within
the
stable
as
pure
as
the
atmosphere
outside
all
dangers
from
injury
by
breathing
impure
air
or
by
draughts
can
be
eliminated

proper
stable
construction

disease
but
in
other
animals
recovery
is
delayed
and
complications
are
more
common
chronic
in
the
horse
the
animal
coughs
frequently
there
is
more
or
less
discharge
from
the
nostrils
and
the
respirations
may
become
labored
when
exercised
the
animal
is
usually
weak
in
poor
flesh
and
unfit
for
work
in
other
cases
symptoms
of
broken
wind
are
noticed
severe
coughing
spells
on
getting
up
from
the
bed
or
on
moving
about
are
characteristic
of
bronchitis
in
hogs
verminous
bronchitis
in
calves
and
lambs
is
characterized
by
severe
spells
of
coughing
difficult
and
labored
breathing
and
a
weak
emaciated
condition
preventive
is
the
same
as
for
colds
in
the
acute
form
the
treatment
consists
largely
in
careful
nursing
properly
ventilated
clean
quarters
that
are
free
from
dust
should
be
provided
the
animal
should
be
covered
with
a
light
or
heavy
blanket
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
stable
and
the
limbs
bandaged
a
light
diet
should
be
fed
for
a
few
days
it
is
advisable
to
give
the
animal
a
physic
of
oil
the
inhalation
of
steam
every
few
hours
during
the
first
few
days
should
be
practised
glycoheroin
may
be
given
three
or
four
times
a
day
animals
affected
with
chronic
bronchitis
should
not
be
exercised
or
worked
we
should
guard
against
their
taking
cold
give
nourishing
feeds
and
a
tonic
if
necessary
congestion
of
the
pulmonary
congestion
is
generally
due
to
overexertion
and
exposure
to
extreme
heat
or
cold
it
may
occur
if
the
animal
is
exercised
when
sick
or
exhausted
hogs
that
are
heated
from
exercise
and
allowed
access
to
cold
water
may
suffer
from
a
congestion
or
engorgement
of
the
lungs
it
may
be
present
at
the
beginning
of
an
attack
of
pneumonia
or
pleurisy
are
difficult
breathing
and
the
animal
fights
for
its
breath
the
body
temperature
may
be
several
degrees
above
the
normal
in
the
mild
form
the
above
symptoms
are
not
so
marked
the
onset
and
course
of
the
disease
are
rapid
recovery
pneumonia
or
death
often
occurring
within
hours
is
not
uncommon
the
discharge
from
the
nostrils
may
be
slightly
tinged
with
blood
or
there
may
be
an
intermittent
discharge
of
blood
from
the
nostrils
or
mouth
the
mucous
membranes
are
pale
the
animal
trembles
and
shows
marked
dyspnoea
preventive
consists
in
using
the
proper
judgment
in
caring
for
and
in
working
or
exercising
animals
this
is
especially
true
if
the
animal
is
affected
with
acute
or
chronic
disease
at
the
very
beginning
bleeding
should
be
practised
hot
blankets
renewed
frequently
and
bandages
to
the
limbs
is
a
very
necessary
part
of
the
treatment
in
case
of
severe
pulmonary
haemorrhage
treatment
is
of
little
use
inflammation
of
the
lungs
is
more
common
in
horses
than
in
any
of
the
other
domestic
animals
the
croupous
form
is
the
most
common
the
inflammation
may
affect
one
or
both
lungs
one
or
more
lobes
or
scattered
lobules
of
lung
tissue
the
inflammation
may
be
acute
subacute
or
chronic
are
very
much
the
same
as
in
other
respiratory
diseases
exposure
to
cold
and
wet
stable
draughts
becoming
chilled
after
perspiring
freely
and
washing
the
animal
with
cold
water
are
the
common
causes
of
pneumonia
inflammation
of
the
lungs
is
especially
apt
to
occur
if
the
animal
is
not
accustomed
to
such
exposure
animals
affected
with
other
respiratory
diseases
are
predisposed
to
pneumonia
drenching
animals
by
way
of
the
nostril
and
irritating
drenches
or
regurgitated
feed
passing
into
the
air
passages
and
lungs
are
the
traumatic
causes
of
pneumonia
vary
in
the
different
forms
of
pneumonia
in
case
pneumonia
occurs
secondarily
the
earliest
symptoms
are
confounded
with
those
of
the
primary
disease
the
first
symptoms
noticed
may
be
a
high
body
temperature
as
indicated
by
chills
and
refusing
to
eat
the
visible
mucous
membranes
are
red
and
congested
the
nostrils
dilated
the
respirations
quickened
and
difficult
the
expired
air
hot
and
the
pulse
beats
accelerated
the
animal
coughs
and
in
the
horse
a
rusty
discharge
may
be
noticed
adhering
to
the
margins
of
the
nostrils
the
horse
refuses
to
lie
down
if
both
lungs
are
inflamed
in
severe
cases
the
expression
of
the
face
indicates
pain
the
respirations
are
labored
the
general
symptoms
aggravated
and
the
animal
stands
with
the
front
feet
spread
apart
cattle
are
inclined
to
lie
down
unless
the
lungs
are
seriously
affected
hogs
like
to
burrow
under
the
litter
course
of
croupous
is
typical
and
unless
it
terminates
fatally
in
the
first
stage
the
periods
of
congestion
hepatization
and
resolution
follow
each
other
in
regular
manner
auscultation
of
the
lungs
is
of
great
value
in
diagnosing
and
watching
the
progress
of
the
disease
it
is
more
difficult
to
determine
the
character
of
the
lung
sounds
in
the
horse
and
cow
than
it
is
in
the
small
animals
this
is
especially
difficult
if
the
animal
is
fat
during
the
period
of
which
lasts
about
a
day
one
can
hear
both
healthy
and
crepitating
sounds
the
period
of
is
characterized
by
an
absence
of
sound
over
the
diseased
area
the
inflammatory
exudates
become
organized
at
the
beginning
of
this
stage
and
the
air
can
not
enter
the
air
cells
this
period
lasts
several
days
marks
the
beginning
of
recovery
or
convalescence
toward
the
end
of
the
second
period
the
inflammatory
exudate
in
the
air
cells
has
begun
to
degenerate
in
the
last
stage
these
exudates
undergo
liquefaction
and
are
absorbed
or
expelled
by
coughing
in
from
seven
days
to
two
weeks
depending
on
the
extent
of
the
inflammation
and
the
general
condition
of
the
animal
the
subacute
the
symptoms
are
mild
and
may
subside
within
a
week
sometimes
form
in
the
lung
of
the
lung
can
be
recognized
by
the
odor
of
the
expired
air
and
the
severity
of
the
symptoms
this
form
of
pneumonia
terminates
fatally
if
the
larger
portion
of
the
lung
tissue
is
inflamed
death
from
asphyxia
may
occur
in
the
second
stage
the
success
in
the
of
pneumonia
depends
largely
on
the
care
properly
ventilated
clean
comfortable
quarters
and
careful
nursing
are
highly
important
large
animals
should
be
given
a
roomy
box
stall
cold
does
not
aggravate
pneumonia
providing
the
animal
body
is
well
protected
with
blankets
and
the
limbs
bandaged
wet
damp
quarters
and
draughts
are
injurious
hogs
should
be
given
plenty
of
bedding
to
burrow
in
a
light
easily
digested
diet
should
be
fed
very
little
roughage
should
be
fed
if
the
animal
does
not
eat
well
it
may
be
given
eggs
and
milk
weak
pulse
beats
should
be
treated
by
giving
digitalis
and
strychnine
counterirritation
to
the
chest
wall
is
indicated
during
convalescence
bitter
tonics
may
be
given
constipation
should
be
treated
by
giving
the
animal
castor
or
linseed
oil
inflammation
of
the
pleura
is
most
common
in
horses
it
occurs
in
all
farm
animals
and
is
frequently
unilateral
there
are
two
forms
of
pleurisy
acute
and
chronic
pleuropneumonia
is
common
when
the
cause
is
a
specific
germ
this
occurs
in
tuberculosis
pleuropneumonia
of
horses
and
pneumococcus
infection
common
are
exposure
to
cold
chilling
winds
draughty
damp
quarters
and
drinking
cold
water
when
perspiring
injuries
to
the
costal
pleura
by
fractured
ribs
and
punctured
wounds
may
cause
it
to
become
inflamed
the
early
symptoms
of
acute
pleurisy
are
chills
rise
in
body
temperature
pain
and
abdominal
breathing
the
most
characteristic
symptom
is
the
ridge
extending
along
the
lower
extremities
of
the
ribs
pleuritic
ridge
the
animal
does
not
stand
still
as
in
pneumonia
but
changes
its
position
occasionally
its
movements
in
many
cases
being
accompanied
by
a
grunt
pressure
on
the
wall
of
the
chest
causes
the
animal
to
flinch
and
show
evidence
of
severe
pain
large
animals
rarely
lie
down
the
cough
is
short
and
painful
on
placing
the
ear
against
the
wall
of
the
chest
and
listening
to
the
respirations
we
are
able
to
hear
friction
sounds
after
a
few
days
effusion
occurs
in
the
pleural
cavity
although
the
animal
may
have
refused
to
eat
up
to
this
time
it
now
appears
greatly
relieved
and
may
offer
to
eat
its
feed
this
relief
may
be
only
temporary
if
the
fluid
exudate
forms
in
sufficient
quantity
to
cause
pressure
on
the
heart
and
lungs
and
interfere
with
their
movement
the
pulse

is
weak
the
respirations
quick
and
labored
the
elbows
are
turned
out
and
the
feet
are
spread
apart
all
of
the
respiratory
muscles
may
be
used
the
expression
of
the
face
may
indicate
threatened
asphyxia
we
may
determine
the
extent
of
the
pleural
exudate
by
auscultation
there
is
no
evidence
of
respiratory
sounds
in
that
portion
of
the

subacute
evidence
of
recovery
is
noted
in
from
four
to
ten
days
very
often
terminates
fatally
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
recovery
takes
place
very
slowly
sometimes
extending
over
a
period
of
several
months
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
horse
to
continue
having
defective
wind
consists
in
good
care
well
ventilated
quarters
and
careful
nursing
the
same
as
recommended
in
the
treatment
of
pneumonia
at
the
very
beginning
the
pain
may
be
relieved
by
the
administration
of
small
doses
of
morphine
if
the
conditions
in
the
stable
permit
a
hot
blanket
that
has
been
dipped
in
hot
water
and
wrung
out
as
dry
as
possible
may
be
applied
to
the
chest
wall
and
covered
with
a
rubber
blanket
this
treatment
should
be
continued
during
the
first
few
days
of
the
inflammation
these
applications
may
be
reinforced
by
occasionally
applying
mustard
paste
to
the
sides
of
the
chest
the
animal
should
be
allowed
to
drink
but
a
limited
amount
of
water
the
feed
must
be
highly
nutritious
milk
and
eggs
should
be
given
if
necessary
a
laxative
dose
of
oil
should
be
given
calomel
aloes
and
digitalis
are
recommended
when
the
effusion
period
approaches
in
order
to
increase
the
elimination
of
fluid
and
lessen
its
entrance
into
the
body
cavity
if
the
amount
of
effusion
is
large
puncture
of
the
thoracic
cavity
with
a
trocar
and
cannula
may
be
practised
this
operation
should
be
performed
carefully
and
all
possible
precautions
used
against
infection
of
the
wound
during
the
later
period
of
the
disease
iodide
of

in
a
way
to

a
number
of
different
diseases
of

diseases
of
the
circulatory
organs
general
the
circulatory
organs
are
the
heart
arteries
veins
and
lymphatics
the
is
the
central
organ
of
the
circulatory
system
fig
its
function
is
to
force
the
blood
through
the
it
is
situated
in
the
thoracic
cavity
between
the
lungs
and
enclosed
by
a
special
fold
of
the
pleura
the
pericardial
sack
there
are
two
kinds
of
arteries
and
veins
the
leave
the
heart
and
carry
the
blood
to
the
many
different
organs
of
the
body
the
return
to
the
heart
and
carry
the
blood
from
the
body
tissues
the
are
small
microscopic
in
size
that
connect
the
arteries
with
the
veins
the
arteries
carry
the
pure
blood
the
opposite
is
true
however
of
the
lesser
or
pulmonary
system
the
pulmonary
artery
carries
the
impure
blood
to
the
lungs
and
the
pulmonary
veins
carry
the
pure
blood
back
from
the
lungs
the
carry
a
transparent
or
slightly
colored
fluid
and
chyle
from
the

the
cellular

portions
of

in
certain
infectious
diseases
the

portion
of
the

may
contain
innumerable
organisms
and
destruction
of
the
blood
cells
occurs
of
tissue
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
the
inflamed
part
undergoes
certain
characteristic
changes
at
the
beginning
there
is
an
increase
in
the
blood
going
to
the
part
this
is
followed
by
a
slowing
of
the
blood
stream
in
the
small
vessels
and
the
collecting
of
the
blood
cells
in
the
capillaries
and
veins
these
circulatory
changes
are
followed
by
the
migration
of
the
blood
cells
and
the
escape
of
the
fluid
portion
of
the
blood
into
the
surrounding
tissue
the
character
of
the
above
circulatory
changes
depends
on
the
extent
of
the
injury
to
the
tissue
this
disturbance
in
domestic
animals
seems
to
be
purely
functional
it
may
occur
independent
of
any
organic
heart
disease
a
highly
nervous
condition
excitement
debility
from
disease
and
the
feeding
of
an
improper
ration
are
the
common
causes
the
heart
beats
are
so
violent
and
tumultuous
as
to
shake
the
body
and
be
noticed
when
standing
near
the
animal
the
heart
sounds

can
be
combined
conveniently
as
the
causes
symptoms
and
treatment
vary
but
little
this
disorder
is
met
with
in
all
species
of
domestic
animals
but
it
is
most
common
in
horses
and
mules
some
writers
state
that
is
more
common
during
the
warm
season
than
it
is
in
the
winter
however
this
does
not
hold
true
in
all
sections
in
the
middle
west
this
disease
is
more
common
in
late
fall
and
winter
is
commonly
by
taking
into
the
body
with
the
feed
and
water
certain
organisms
and
toxins
that
are
capable
of
producing
an
inflammation
of
the
brain
the
infectious
organism
or
toxins
are
taken
up
by
the
absorbing
vessels
of
the
intestines
the
secondary
form
of
the
disease
usually
occurs
in
connection
with
other
diseases
such
as
influenza
tuberculosis
and
acute
pharyngitis
or
as
a
result
of
wound
infection
unhygienic
conditions
as
unsanitary
and
poorly
ventilated
stables
and
filthy
drinking
places
play
a
very
important
part
in
the
production
of
the
simple

acute
form
of
meningitis
sudden
changes
in
the
feed
and
the
feeding
of
rotten
mouldy
feeds
may
cause
it
in

it
may
follow
the
feeding
of

is
manifested
in

complete
loss
of
appetite
paralysis
may
be
the
most
prominent
symptom
the
animal
lies
in
a
natural
position
or
stretched
out
and
lifting
the
head
occasionally
and
moving
the
limbs
but
it
is
unable
to
rise
loss
of
sensibility
may
gradually
progress
until
the
animal
becomes
semiconscious
or
comatose
in
case
the
inflammation
is
acute
and
involves
the
greater
portion
of
the
brain
and
its
coverings
death
occurs
within
a
few
days
occasionally
the
animal
survives
several
weeks
there
are
few
permanent
or
complete
recoveries
principal
lines
of
are
preventive
measures
and
careful
nursing
this
is
one
of
the
diseases
that
can
be
largely
prevented
by
observing
all
possible
sanitary
precautions
in
caring
for
animals
it
is
admitted
by
writers
that
the
greater
majority
of
cases
of
inflammation
of
the
brain
and
its
coverings
are
caused
by
infection
proper
stable
construction
ventilation
and
disposal
of
the
manure
an
occasional
disinfection
of
the
stable
cleaning
and
disinfecting
the
drinking
places
and
water
tanks
and
the
necessary
attention
to
the
ration
greatly
reduce
the
loss
from
this
disease
the
animal
should
be
gotten
into
a
dark
quiet
roomy
stall
that
is
well
bedded
a
swing
may
be
placed
under
a
large
animal
if
it
is
able
to
support
any
of
its
weight
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
nervous
excitement
we
should
do
nothing
to
disturb
it
if
possible
the
position
of
the
animal
that
is
unable
to
get
up
should
be
changed
and
the
bed
kept
clean
and
dry
cold
in
the
form
of
wet
or
ice
packs
should
be
applied
to
the
head
during
the
acute
stage
symptoms
of
excitement
must
be
overcome
by
large
doses
of
sedatives
iodide
of
potassium
and
strychnine
may
help
in
overcoming
the
paralysis
the
bowels
should
be
emptied
by
giving
an
occasional
physic
a
very
light
easily
digested
diet
should
be
fed
partial
or
complete
paralysis
of
the
posterior
portion
of
the
this
disorder
is
especially
common
in
the
small
animals
the
hog
is
most
frequently
affected
following
may
be
mentioned
inflammation
of
the
spinal
cord
commonly
occurs
in
influenza
strangles
and
mixed
infections
constipation
brought
on
by
improper
feeding
and
insufficient
exercise
is
a
predisposing
cause
injuries
such
as
strains
and
blows
in
the
region
of
the
back
may
also
cause
it
compression
of
the
spinal
cord
by
the
vertebrae
is
no
doubt
a
very
common
cause
dislocation
enlargement
of
the
disks
between
the
vertebrae
bony
enlargements
resulting
from
strains
and
injuries
rickets
tuberculosis
and
actinomycosis
and
tumors
commonly
cause
compression
of
the
cord
it
is
rarely
caused
by
parasites
young
fat
animals
are
especially
prone
to
injuries
in
the
region
of
the
back
such
animals
may
suffer
from
malnutrition
of
the
bones
and
complete
fractures
of
the
thigh
bones
may
occur
extreme
heat
from
the
sun
rays
and
close
hot
quarters
are
probable
causes
that
is
most
prominent
is
the
partial
or
complete
loss
of
control
over
the
movements
of
the
hind
parts
the
appetite
may
be
little
interfered
with
the
animal
may
sit
on
the
haunches
with
the
limbs
projecting
forward
or
swing
the
hind
quarters
from
side
to
side
in
walking
or
trotting
irregularity
in
the
animal
movements
is
especially
noticeable
when
turning
or
backing
in
case
the
animal
suffers
pain
the
spine
is
held
rigid
or
arched
and
when
forced
to
move
marked
evidence
of
pain
occurs
there
may
be
a
decrease
or
increase
in
the
sensibility
of
the
part
the
increase
in
sensibility
is
noticed
on
striking
the
muscles
with
the
hand
or
rubbing
the
hair
the
wrong
way
spasmodic
twitching
or
contractions
in
the
muscles
sometimes
occur
there
is
frequent
elevation
of
temperature
the
animal
is
unable
to
pass
urine
or
faeces
or
there
may
be
an
involuntary
passage
of
the
body
excretions
the
outcome
of
this
disease
is
unfavorable
acute
inflammation
of
the
covering
of
the
cord
may
subside
within
a
few
days
cases
that
do
not
recover
within
a
few
weeks
should
be
destroyed
paralysis
of
the
hind
parts
should
not
be
confused
with
rheumatism
azoturia
and
other
disorders
that
may
interfere
with
the
movements
of
the
posterior
portion
of
the
body
is
largely
along
preventive
lines
a
predisposition
toward
rickets
and
injuries
may
be
prevented
by
feeding
a
proper
ration
and
permitting
the
animal
to
take
exercise
the
quarters
and
the
attendant
are
frequently
responsible
for
injuries
if
this
is
the
case
the
rough
handling
of
the
animals
should
be
immediately
corrected
and
any
condition
of
the
quarters
that
favors
the
crowding
or
piling
up
of
animals
should
be
changed
large
animals
may
be
placed
in
swings
if
they
are
able
to
support
a
part
of
their
weight
on
the
hind
limbs
this
is
especially
indicated
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
disorder
small
animals
should
be
given
a
good
bed
a
very
light

general
the
two
layers
that
form
the
skin
are
the
and
the
the
cells
of
the
outer
layer
or
epidermis
are
of
two
kinds
the
superficial
portion
is
formed
by
horny
flattened
cells
and
the
deeper
by
softer
cells
this
layer
of
the
skin
varies
greatly
in
thickness
in
the
different
species
the
derma
is
composed
of
some
muscular
fibres
interwoven
with
the
fibres
it
contains
the
roots
of
the
hair
follicles
sweat
and
oil
glands
the
external
face
which
is
covered
by
the
epidermis
shows
a
multitude
of
little
elevations
these
are
the
vascular
and
nervous
papillae
in
addition
it
shows
openings

and
internal
causes
irritation
to
the
skin
may
be
either
chemical
thermic
or
mechanical
the
internal
causes
may
be
due
to
an
individual
predisposition
together
with
digestive
disturbances
and
the
eating
of
feeds
too
rich
in
protein
in
this
chapter
parasitic
skin
diseases
produced
by
insects
will
not
be
discussed
falling
out
of
the
hair
and
falling
out
of
the
hair
and
feathers
frequently
occurs
independent
of
parasitic
diseases
this
condition
does
not
occur
as
an
independent
disorder
but
as
a
secondary
affection
it
is
due
to
faulty
nutrition
and
irritation
to
the
skin
intestinal
diseases
insufficient
feed
and
feed
of
bad
quality
are
common
causes
animals
that
are
fed
a
heavy
ration
or
that
lie
on
dirty
wet
bedding
frequently
lose
large
patches
of
hair
sheep
that
are
dipped
in
late
fall
and
early
winter
or
exposed
to
wet
cold
weather
may
lose
a
part
of
their
fleece
it
is
not
uncommon
for
animals
toward
the
latter
period
of
pregnancy
or
that
sweat
freely
to
lose
patches
of

heals
of
itself
within
a
few
weeks
preventive
are
of
special
importance
in
sheep
and
horses
this
consists
in
avoiding
conditions
that
may
lead
to
alopecia
and
in
correcting
the
diet
in
horses
the
regions
of
the
mane
and
tail
should
be
washed
with
soap
or
rubbed
with
alcohol
and
spirits
of
camphor
equal
parts
treatment
should
be
persisted
in
for
a
long
period

necessary
urticaria
nettlerash
urticaria
is
characterized
by
roundish
elevations
that
appear
quickly
and
become
scattered
over
a
part
or
the
whole
surface
of
the
skin
they
are
caused
by
an
inflammatory
infiltration
of
the
deeper
layers
of
the
skin
horses
and
hogs
are
most
frequently
affected
of
urticaria
are
irritating
juices
of
certain
plants
secretions
of
flies
ants
and
some
caterpillars
irritating
drugs
scratching
sweating
and
the
action
of
cold
on
a
warm
skin
it
has
been
observed
in
connection
with
the
feeding
of
certain
leguminous
feeds
and
digestive
disturbances
horses
that
are
fat
or
putting
on
flesh
rapidly
seem
to
be
predisposed
to
this
disorder
urticaria
may
occur
in
certain
infectious
diseases
characteristic
is
the
formation
on
the
skin
of
roundish
elevations
or
hives
there
may
be
an
elevation
of
body
temperature
and
partial
loss
of
appetite
small
animals
may
act
restless
and
show
evidence
of
itching
or
pain
this
symptom
is
very
common
in
hogs
the
eruption
may
last
only
a
few
hours
or
a
few
days
or
because
of
the
animal
scratching
or
rubbing
the
part
the
skin
may
become
scabby
and
small
pustules
form
an
important
is
to
avoid
the
use
of
agents
capable
of
irritating
the
skin
and
producing
urticaria
when
treating
parasitic
skin
diseases
it
is
very
advisable
to
give
the
animal
a
saline
cathartic
epsom
or
glauber
salts
the
skin
may
be
washed
with
cold
water
or
a
weak
water
solution
of
permanganate
of
potassium
acne
summer
rash
in
this
skin
disease
the
oil
glands
and
hair
follicles
are
inflamed
and
sometimes
infected
with
pus
germs
this
results
in
skin
eruptions
varying
in
size
from
the
point
of
a
pin
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
diameter
this
inflammation
is
most
prominent
during
the
warm
weather
are
local
irritation
to
the
skin
from
lying
on
filthy
floors
sweating
and
irritation
from
the
harness
according
to
some
writers
pus
germs
are
the
only
cause
the
mechanical
agents
merely
aiding
in
the
production
of
the
infection
the
face
side
of
the
neck
shoulders
back
and
sides
of
the
trunk
and
quarters
are
the
usual
seats
of
disease
the
pimples
or
nodules
may
disappear
within
a
few
weeks
or
persist
throughout
the
warm
season
the
eruption
may
disappear
without
leaving
scars
or
suppuration
occurs
and
small
bald
spots
result
consists
in
removing
the
cause
of
the
disease
and
cleaning
the
skin
with
antiseptic
washes
the
surroundings
of
the
animal
must
be
kept
clean
and
a
good
bed
provided
if
possible
the
horse
should
be
laid
off
from
work
as
soon
as
the
condition
is
noted
washing
the
part
with
a
weak
water
solution
of
permanganate
of
potassium
may
be
practised
daily
fowler
solution
of
arsenic
may
be
given
this
may
be
given
with
the
feed
this
is
an
inflammation
of
the
vascular
capillary
bodies
and
the
superficial
layer
of
the
skin
there
may
be
marked
inflammatory
exudate
causing
the
surface
of
the
skin
to
become
excessively
moist
and
more
or
less
itching
redness
vesicles
and
pustules
may
characterize
the
inflammation
in
the
chronic
form
the
skin
may
become
thickened
and
greatly
changed
in
structure
eczematous
inflammation
of
the
skin
may
occur
in
all
domestic
animals
but
it
is
most
common
in
the
dog
in
the
horse
local
eczema
scratches
is
common
the
most
frequent
is
external
irritation
accumulations
of
filth
on
the
skin
and
continual
wetting
of
the
part
are
common
causes
mechanical
causes
are
rubbing
pressure
the
action
of
the
sun
rays
and
chemical
irritants
internal
causes
such
as
catarrhal
diseases
of
the
stomach
and
weakness
and
emaciation
from
disease
may
act
as
direct
or
predisposing
causes
animals
seem
to
be
predisposed
to
the
disease
vary
in
the
different
species
of
animals
in
the
horse
the
thin
skin
posterior
to
the
fetlock
and
knee
in
front
of
the
hock
and
on
the
under
side
of
the
body
is
most
commonly
inflamed
moisture
and
dirt
seem
to
be
the
most
common
causes
eczema
may
involve
the
skin
covered
by
the
mane
and
tail
in
animals
that
are
not
properly
groomed
and
inclined
to
rub
or
scratch
cattle
may
suffer
from
eczematous
inflammations
in
the
region
of
the
forehead
back
of
neck
and
base
of
tail
a
very
common
form
of
the
disease
involves
the
space
between
the
toes
sheep
frequently
suffer
from
inflammation
of
the
skin
over
the
fetlock
region
the
skin
of
animals
having
long
fleeces
or
heavy
coats
of
hair
that
become
wet
at
a
time
when
there
is
no
opportunity
to
dry
out
quickly
may
become
inflamed
dogs
are
commonly
affected
by
the
acute
and
chronic
forms
of
eczema
eczema
of
swine
is
limited
mostly
to
young
hogs
it
is
rather
rare
excepting
in
hogs
that
are
pasturing
on
certain
kinds
of
clover
and
rape
or
on
muck
lands
the
inflammation
is
accompanied
by
a
marked
tenderness
and
itching
and
the
animal
licks
and
scratches
the
part
this
increases
the
extent
of
the
skin
lesions
the
skin
appears
moist
later
dirty
scabby
and
thickened
cracks
and
pustules
may
form
gangrene
and
sloughing
of
the
skin
may
occur
is
both
preventive
and
curative
cases
of
eczema
caused
by
filth
and
wetness
can
be
prevented
by
giving
the
necessary
attention
to
keeping
the
skin
clean
and
not
allowing
animals
access
to
muddy
filthy
places
keeping
the
bed
clean
and
regulating
the
diet
are
important
preventive
measures
before
the
inflammation
can
be
successfully
treated
the
cause
must
be
removed
in
acute
eczema
it
is
advisable
to
protect
the
part
against
water
filth
and
air
powders
and
ointments
may
be
used
during
the
early
stages
of
the
inflammation
two
parts
boric
acid
four
parts
flour
and
one
part
tannic
acid
may
be
dusted
over
the
moist
surface
one
part
zinc
oxide

vaseline
is
a
useful
ointment
scratching
the
part
should
be
controlled
in
every
case
by
muzzles
collars
and
bandages
dirt
and
scales
may
be
removed
from
the
skin
by
washing
with
cotton
soaked
in
lime
water
or
linseed
oil
the
animal
should
receive
laxative
doses
of
glauber
salts
or
oil
every
few
days
a
simple
easily
digested
ration
should
be
fed
the

examination
of
the
in
examining
and
treating
the
eye
we
should
avoid
rough
and
hasty
manipulation
the
animal
should
be
approached
slowly
it
is
best
for
the
attendant
who
is
familiar
with
the
animal
to
hold
it
for
the
examiner
it
is
advisable
on
approaching
the
animal
to
stroke
its
face
and
in
the
horse
to
brush
its
foretop
away
the
hand
should
be
carried
slowly
to
the
front
of
the
eye
and
the
lids
separated
with
the
fingers
and
thumb
if
we
wish
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
cornea
in
cattle
the
best
view
of
these
parts
can
be
obtained
by
taking
hold
of
the
nose
and
lifting
the
head
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
satisfactory
examination
of
the
eye
outside
of
the
stable
where
the
light
is
coming
from
all
directions
the
most
satisfactory
conditions
under
which
a
general
examination
can
be
made
is
to
stand
the
animal
facing
a
transom
window
or
open
door
we
may
then
look
directly
into
the
eye
and
note
the
condition
of
the
different
refracting
media
the
lens
should
appear
transparent
and
free
from
scars
the
aqueous
humor
free
from
any
cloudiness
or
precipitate
both
pupillary
openings
should
be
the
same
size
and
not
too
small
or
too
large
in
the
bright
light
as
we
look
through
the
pupillary
openings
both
the
lens
and
the
vitreous
humor
should
refract
the
light
properly
and
not
appear
white
or
in
color
the
color
of
the
iris
should
be
noted
if
it
lacks
lustre
or
appears
dull
this
may
indicate
an
inflammation
in
periodic
ophthalmia
in
horses
the
iris
loses
its
lustre
and
becomes
a
color
it
is
very
important
to
note
this
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
iris
we
should
note
in
addition
the
expression
of
the
animal
face
the
position
of
the
ears
and
eyelids
and
manner
of
the
walk
horses
that
have
defective
sight
may
show
a
deep
wrinkle
in
the
upper
eyelid
when
startled
or
looking
directly
at
an
object
animals
that
are
blind
hold
the
ears
in
a
characteristic
position
and
may
stumble
and
walk
over
or
run
into
objects
unless
stopped
the
ophthalmoscope
is
a
very
useful
instrument
for
determining
the
condition
of
the
different
structures
of
the
eyes
when
in
the
hands
of
persons
who
are
trained
in
its
use
this
is
an
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
eyelids
and
covering
the
eyeball
the
two
forms
of
conjunctivitis
common
in
domestic
animals
are
the
and
symptoms
in
the
two
forms
of
conjunctivitis
they
may
be
distinguished
from
each
other
by
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
inflammatory
discharge
in
the
catarrhal
form
there
is
a
discharge
of
tears
and
the
lids
are
held
more
or
less
closed
the
mucous
membrane
is
usually
brick
red
in
color
and
swollen
a
little
later
the
discharge
becomes
heavier
and
adheres
more
to
the
margins
of
the
lids
the
lids
continue
tender
and
the
inflammation
painful
the
surface
of
the
cornea
may
appear
white
and
the
prominent
but
it
is
only
in
the
severe
cases
that
inflammation
of
this
portion
of
the
eye
occurs
in
such
cases
an
elevation
in
body
temperature
may
occur
this
is
especially
true
of
purulent
conjunctivitis
when
primarily
caused
by
an
infectious
agent
in
the
purulent
form
the
discharge
is
heavy
and
is
both
preventive
and
curative
the
first
object
must
be
to
remove
the
cause
irritating
gases
resulting
from
stable
filth
should
be
remedied
by
correcting
the
unsanitary
conditions
in
the
stable
conditions
favoring
injury
to
the
eye
from
foreign
bodies
such
as
chaff
and
a
careless
attendant
should
be
corrected
animals
suffering
from
the
infectious
or
purulent
form
of
inflammation
should
be
separated
from
the
other
animals
foreign
bodies
should
be
removed
promptly
before
they
have
had
an
opportunity
to
set
up
a
serious
inflammation
it
is
necessary
to
confine
the
animal
in
some
way
before
attempting
to
do
this
horses
should
be
twitched
cattle
held
by
the
nose
and
the
head
of
a
small
animal
held
firmly
with
the
hands
it
may
be
necessary
to
cocainize
the
eye
before
the
operator
can
remove
the
foreign
object
with
absorbent
cotton
or
with
forceps
in
case
of
injuries
and
irritation
to
the
lids
by
foreign
bodies
the
eye
may
be
flooded
with
a
three
per
cent
water
solution
of
boric
acid
twice
daily
or
as
often
as
necessary
such
washes
or
lotions
may
be
applied
with
a
small
piece
of
absorbent
cotton
using
a
fresh
piece
each
time
the
eye
is
dressed
a
medicine
dropper
may
also
be
used
a
lotion
containing
silver
nitrate
two
to
four
grains
and
distilled
water
one
ounce
is
useful
in
combating
the
inflammation
this
may
be
applied
twice
daily
irritating
lotions
should
be
avoided
if
possible
in
the
treatment
of

unsoundnesses
and
blemishes
general
the
value
of
a
horse
depends
largely
on
the
condition
of
the
limbs
and
their
ability
to
do
the
work
for
which
they
are
intended
this
fact
is
frequently
overlooked
by
experienced
horsemen
who
give
attention
to
general
conformation
and
action
rather
than
to
soundness
of
limb
diseases
affecting
the
limbs
may
be
classed
as
and
this
classification
is
based
on
the
degree
to
which
the
disease
interferes
or
may
interfere
with
the
work
that
the
animal
is
called
on
to
perform
unsoundnesses
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
part
or
the
use
of
the
animal
for
a
certain
work
blemishes
do
not
such
a
basis
for
the
classification
of
diseases
does
not
enable
us
to
place
certain
diseased
conditions
of
the
limbs
in
the
unsound
or
the
blemish
class
at
all
times
a
curb
may
if
it
produces
lameness
be
classed
as
an
unsoundness
if
it
does
not
cause
the
animal
to
go
lame
and
the
enlargement
on
the
posterior
border
of
the
hock
is
small
it
is
classed
as
a
blemish
a
high
splint
may
place
the
animal
in
the
unsound

the

must
be
careful
and
not
pass
over
any
part
of
a
limb
without
determining
whether
it
is
normal
or
not
he
should
note
any
abnormal
position
that
the
animal
may
take
while
standing
at
rest
every
movement
should
be
watched
closely
as
the
manner
of
favoring
the
part
may
characterize
the
lameness
negative
symptoms
of
lameness
in
a
part
may
at
times
prove
as
valuable
in
forming
a
diagnosis
as
positive
symptoms
the
resting
of
either
of
the
front
feet
when
the
horse
is
standing
at
ease
indicates
that
there
is
some
soreness
in
the
rested
limb
or
placing
one
or
both
feet
well
in
front
of
the
line
of
support
when
the
animal
is
standing
usually
indicates
a
diseased
condition
of
the
feet
it
is
natural
for
a
horse
that
is
standing
in
a
stall
to
rest
the
hindfeet
alternately
when
the
hindfoot
is
rested
because
of
a
soreness
in
some
portion
of
the
limb

may
be
flexed

toe

the
foot
flexed

bearing
practically
no
weight
in

feet
both
feet
may
be
placed
well
in
front
of
the
normal
position
and
the
hindfeet
well
under
the
body
when
examining
a
horse
the
blanket
or
harness
should
be
removed
the
horse
should
have
on
an
open
bridle
or
halter
and
the
attendant
should
give
it
as
much
freedom
of
the
head
as
possible
the
examiner
should
examine
each
limb
carefully
and
note
any
symptom
of
disease
that
may
be
present
the
attendant
should
walk
the
animal
straight
away
from
the
person
making
the
examination
toward
and
past
him
so
that
the
animal
movements
can
be
observed
from
both
sides
from
behind
and
in
front
this
examination
should
be
repeated
with
the
horse
at
a
slow
trot
the
character
of
the
lameness
may
enable
us
to
locate
the
seat
of
the
disease
we
must
first
determine
in
which
limb
the
animal
is
lame
this
part
of
the
diagnosis
is
not
difficult
the
pain
suffered
every
time
weight
is
thrown
on
the
diseased
limb
causes
the
horse
to
step
quickly
and
shift
as
much
of
the
body
weight
as
possible
on
the
well
foot
the
foot
of
the
lame
limb
is
jerked
up
rather
quickly
after
weight
is
thrown
on
it
this
favoring
of
the
part
varies
in
the
different
diseases
when
the
foot
of
the
sound
limb
comes
to
the
ground
more
weight
than
common
is
placed
on
it
if
the
seat
of
the
lameness
is
in
a
front
limb
there
is
a
decided
nodding
or
movement
of
the
head
downward
when
the
weight
is
placed
on
the
well
foot
if
both
forefeet
are
diseased
the
animal
steps
shorter
and
more
quickly
than
common
lameness
in
a
hind
limb
is
characterized
by
more
or
less
dropping
of
the
quarter
of
the
well
limb
when
weight
is
thrown
on
it
and
sometimes
by
a
hitch
or
elevation
of
the
quarter
of
the
diseased
limb
when
it
is
carried
forward
unless
there
are
symptoms
of
present
it
may
be
quite
difficult
to
locate
the
seat
of
lameness
sometimes
local
symptoms
are
misleading
after
the
lameness
has
been
located
in
a
certain
limb
its
movement
must
be
carefully
noted
in
order
to
detect
the
part
favored
if
the
lameness
is
not
characteristic
enough
to
enable
the
examiner
to
locate
the
seat
of
it
it
is
then
necessary
to
put
the
animal
through
some
movement
that
may
emphasize
the
soreness
in
the
part
the
animal
may
show
a
certain
reluctance
to
throw
weight
on
the
limb
when
turned
to
the
right
or
left
moving
the
horse
in
a
small
circle
with
the
lame
limb
on
the
outside
may
cause
the
animal
to
use
the
muscles
of
the
shoulder
more
freely
and
emphasize
any
soreness
that
may
be
present
if
the
lame
limb
is
on

soreness
anywhere
in
the
foot
may
be
increased
because
of
the
extra
weight
thrown
on
this
portion
of

limb
moving
the

the
lighter
breeds
of
horses
are
the
most
frequent
sufferers
because
of
the
greater
strain
thrown
on
the
tendons
of
the
forefeet
inflammation
of
these
tendons
is
far
more
common
than
it
is
in
the
hindfoot
diseased
conditions
of
the
hind
tendons
are
usually
due
to
other
causes
than
strain
the
following
and
should
be
considered
weak
flexor
tendons
and
heavy
bodies
predispose
animals
to
inflammation
of
the
tendons
and
suspensory
ligament
quality
not
size
is
the
factor
to
consider
when
judging
the
strength
of
a
tendon
long
slender
pasterns
increase
the
strain
on
these
structures
and
this
mechanical
strain
is
further
increased
by
low
heels
and
long
toes
the
character
of
the
work
and
the
condition
of
the
road
that
the
animal
travels
over
are
important
factors
to
consider
trotting

running
horses
more
often
suffer
from
injuries
to
tendons
and
ligaments
than
draft
horses
travelling
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
over
an
uneven
road
slipping
and
catching
the
foot
in
a
rut
or
car
track
are
common
causes
bruises
and
wounds
may
result
in
the
tendons

held
in
a
more
upright
position
than

and
it
may
take
advantage
of
any
uneven
place
on
which
to
rest
the

the
local
symptoms
are
quite
prominent
the
tendons
may
be
hot
and
swollen
pressure
may
cause
the
animal
pain
in
chronic
tendinitis
the
tendon
may
be
thickened
and
rough
or
knotty
pain
is
not
a
prominent
symptom
in
this
class
of
cases
shortening
of
the
inflamed
tendon
may
occur
causing
the
animal
to
knuckle
over
rupture
of
one
or
more
of
the
tendons
and
the
suspensory
ligament
can
be
recognized
by
the
abnormal
extension
of
the
pastern
if
the
ruptured
tendon
heals
it
always
results
in
a
thickening
at
the
point
of
the
rupture
that
gives
the
tendons
a
bowed
appearance
this
is
termed
the
lameness
resulting
from
an
inflammation
of
tendons
resembles
that
resulting
from
strains
and
injuries
to
the
fetlock
joint
especially
in
the
region
of
the
sesamoid
bones
inflammation
of
the
sesamoid
bones
differs
slightly
from
the
former
pressure
over
the
posterior
region
of
the
fetlock
may
cause
the
animal
pain
the
lameness
shows
a
tendency
to
disappear
with
rest
and
reappear
when
the
animal
is
again
worked
lameness
is
most
prominent
in
some
cases
when
the
animal
is
first
moved
out
there
may
be
a
lack
of
local
symptoms
such
as
heat
and
swelling
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
bony
enlargement
to
form
on
the
sesamoid
bone
after
a
few
months
or
a
year
the
following
is
recommended
horses
that
have
a
poor
quality
of
tendon
and
weak
fetlocks
and
pasterns
should
not
be
used
for
breeding
purposes
careful
driving
would
prevent
a
large
percentage
of
injuries
to
tendons
the
most
important
treatment
for
all
injuries
due
to
strains
is
rest
in
all
cases
of
severe
strain
to
the
structures
in
this
region
it
is
very
advisable
to
apply
a
plaster
bandage
this
should
be
left
on
for
at
least
two
weeks
when
the
acute
inflammation
has
subsided
counterirritants
may
be
applied
either
cold
or
hot
applications
are
recommended
cold
applications
are
to
be
preferred
at
the
beginning
of
the
inflammation
covering
the
tendons
with
a
cold
bandage
or
with
a
heavy
layer
of
antiphlogistin
is
recommended
the
horse
should
not
be
worked
until
after
the
tendons
have
had
an
opportunity
to
completely
recover
from
the
inflammation
contracted

foals
are
sometimes
unable
to
stand
on
their
front
feet
because
of
the
excessive

colt
may
walk

this
sometimes
results
in
severe
injury
to
the
skin
and
the
underlying
tissues
in
the
mature
horse

not
always
due
to

it
may
occur
as
a
symptom
of
inflammation
of
the
flexor
tendons
ligaments
of
the
fetlock
joint
and
the
articulation
as
well
it
may
be
noticed
in
animals
that
have
or
lameness
the
most
for
this
unsoundness
is
inflammation
of
the
muscles
and
tendons
of
the
flexors
of
the
digit
as
a
result
of
long
standing
or
severe
inflammation
shortening

these
structures
occurs
in
consequence
of
the
contraction
of
the
inflammatory
or
cicatricial
tissue
in
the
newborn
colt
is
commonly
caused
by
a
weakness
or
lack
of
innervation
of
the
extensor
muscle
of
the
digit
judging
from
the
quick
recovery
that
usually
occurs
other
causes
for
this
condition
are
seldom
present
recommended
for
the
colt
is
supporting
the
fetlock
with
a
light
plaster
bandage
this
should
be
applied
very
soon
after
birth
in
order
to
prevent
bruising
of
the
fetlock
a
light
bandage
should
be
applied
to
the
limb
from
the
hoof
to
the
knee
the
colt
is
laid
on
its
side
the
toe
extended
as
much
as
possible
and
the
plaster
bandage
applied
this
should
be
removed
in
about
one
week
and
fresh
bandages
applied
in
about
two
weeks
the
young
animal
is
usually
able
to
walk
on
the
toe
as
soon
as
it
is
able
to
do
this
a
bandage
is
unnecessary
it
is
not
advisable
to
turn

there
is
any
chance
for
the
bandages
to

the
most
valuable
preventive
measures
in
young

the
treatment
for

horses
both

the
most
of

shoeing
and
the
condition
of
the
feet
are
also
important
factors
animals
that
have
a
narrow
chest
or
pelvis
interfere
because
the
legs
are
placed
too
closely
together
turning
in
of
the
knees
or
winging
in
or
out
of
the
feet
or
any
other
defective
conformation
of
the
limbs
that
tends
to
prevent
the
animal
from
moving
the
feet
in

lead
to
serious
interfering
a

an
unbalanced
condition
of
the
foot
and
improper
fitting
of
the
shoes
are
common
causes
for
interfering
in
horses
that
would
otherwise
move
the
feet
in

debility

overwork
may
cause
the
animal
to
interfere
temporarily
an
unbalanced

the
common
causes
for
injuries

no

many
cases
of

could
be
prevented
by
careful
training
and
balancing
of
the
foot
when
the
animal
is
growing

when

after

we
judge
the
age
by
the
degree
of

the
appearance
of

the

illustration
fig
of

there
are
several
different
factors
that
may
cause
the
wear
on
the
teeth
and
the
appearance
of
their
table
surfaces
to
vary
in
the
different
individuals
the
two
factors
that
are
of
the
most
importance
are
the
quality
of
the
teeth
and
the
character
of
feed
soft
teeth
wear
more
quickly
than
hard
teeth
and
the
teeth
of
horses
that
feed
over
closely
cropped
and
sandy
pastures
wear
rapidly
because
of
the
dirt
and
grit
present
on
the
short
grass
this
variation
in
the
wear
is
of
little
importance
to
the
person
who
must
judge
the
age
of
a
horse
that
he
expects
to
purchase
by
the
condition
of
the
teeth
in
reality
a
horse
is
just
as
old
as
the
wear
on
the
teeth
and
his
general
appearance
indicate
in
order
to
stand
severe
work
the
animal
must
be
able
to
masticate
the
feed
and
prepare
it
for
digestion
in
the
stomach
and
intestines
the
degree
of
wear
on
the
molar
teeth
may
be
indicated
by
the
wear
on
the
incisors
the
general
condition
of
the
horse

his
ability
to
stand
hard
work
depend
very
largely
on
the
condition
of
the

very
difficult

age

inflammation
is
a
pathological
condition
of
a

characterized
by
altered

disturbance
of
circulation
and
destructive
and
constructive
changes
in
the
irritated
part
heat
redness
swelling
pain
and
disturbed
function
are
the
symptoms
which
characterize
inflammation
changes
in
the

in
inflammation
are
as
follows
an
increase
in
the

into
the
neighboring

and
transudes
through
the

of
the

inflammation
originating
from
injuries
very
frequently
changes
to
an
infectious
form
through
the

by
bacteria
bruised
tissue
may
become
infected
with
organisms
and
an
abscess
or

become
more
or
less
infected
by
irritating
microorganisms
the
following

increased
heat

an
important
symptom
it
is
due
to
the
increased

because
of
the
pigmented
hairy
skin
of
domestic
animals
redness
is
of
little
value
in
locating
superficial
inflammation
swelling
is
a
valuable
local
symptom
it
is
produced
by
the
inflammatory
exudates
pain
results
from
the
pressure
on
the
sensory
nerves
by
the
inflammatory
swelling
for
example
the
laminae
of
the
foot
are
imprisoned
between
the
horny
wall
and
the
pedal
bone
this
structure
is
well
supplied
with
sensory
nerves
and
when
it
becomes
inflamed
and
swollen
the
tissues
are
subject
to
severe
pressure
and
the
pain
is
severe
inflammation
of
a
tendon
results
in
lameness
of
the
udder
in
suspension
of
milk
secretions
and
of
the

by
interference
with
digestion
of

such
symptoms
may
be
grouped
under
the
head
of

largely
modified
by
the
nature
of
the
tissue
in
which
it
occurs
a
serous
inflammation
is
characterized
by
serous
watery
exudates
this
form
occurs
in
the
serous
membranes
mucous
membranes
and
skin
blisters
on
the
skin
and
inflammation
of
bursae
capped
hock
and
shoe
boil
are
examples
of
this
type
inflammations
such
as
occur
in
pleurisy
and
peritonitis
are
common
chronic
inflammation
commonly
results
in
new
formations
of
tissue
and
it
is
named
according
to
the
character
of
the
new
tissue
formed
as
ossifying
adhesive
and
fibrous
inflammation
bacteria
produce
suppurative
inflammation
such
diseases
as
tuberculosis
glanders
and
are
specific
inflammations
specific
infectious
diseases
may
be
classed
as
generalized
inflammation
as
they
usually
involve
the
entire
body
inflammation
terminates
in
resolution
when
the
serum
is
reabsorbed
by
the
and
lymphatics
the
living
find
their
way
back
into
the
circulation
and
the
dead
cells
disintegrate
and
are
taken
up
by
the
vessels
the
time
required
for
the
tissues
to
return
to
the
normal
varies
from
a
few
hours
to
several
weeks
an
acute
inflammation
may
end
in
the
chronic
form
this
may
then
terminate
in
new
formations
such
as
adhesions
fibrous
thickenings
and
bony
enlargements
severe
inflammation
especially
if
localized
and
superficial
may
result
in

the
following
is
recommended
the

rest
may
be
obtained
in
different
ways
inflamed

the
agents
used
in
the

foreign
bodies
such
as

the
hair
along

it
is
very
often
necessary

remove
the
horns
of
cattle
in
order
to
prevent
their
injuring
or
worrying
certain
individuals
in

this
operation
is
of
greatest
economic
importance
in
dairy
and
feeding
cattle
when
first
practised
the
dehorning
of
mature
cattle
was
condemned
by
some
persons
who
deemed
it
an
inhuman
and
unnecessary
operation
it
is
surely
a
humane
act
to
remove
the
horns
of
cattle
that
are
confined
in
small
yards
and
pastures
and
prevent
them
from
painfully
or
seriously
injuring
one
another
in
most
localities
there
are
men
who
are
well
equipped
to
dehorn
cattle
and
able
to
perform
this
operation
for
a
very
moderate
fee
it
is
not
advisable
to
attempt
to
dehorn
a
number
of
adult
cattle
if
the
operator
is
not
well
equipped
for
the
work
unless
a
dehorning
rack
is
available
for
confining
the
animals
there
is
danger
of
injuring
them
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
saw
off
the
horn
quickly
and
satisfactorily
this
increases
the
pain
that
the
animal
suffers
and
horn
stubs
soon
develop
good
equipment
such
as
a
chute
saw
or
clippers
is
necessary
a
dehorning
chute
should
be
built
of
plank
with
a
good
frame
well
bolted
together
with
stanchion
and
nose
block
for
confining
the
head
most
operators
prefer
a
meat
saw
for
cutting
off
the
horns
it
is
preferable
to
dehorning
shears
as
there
is
danger
of
fracturing
the
frontal
bone
when
removing
the

of
mature
cattle
the
best
form
of
dehorning
shears
have
a
wide

should
be
cut

it
is
usually
unnecessary
to

cotton
may
be

opening
in
order
to
keep
it
in
place
pine
tar
may
be
smeared
over
this
dressing
some
operators
prefer
cauterizing
the
wound
with
a
iron
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
haemorrhage
during
warm
weather
the
wound
should
be
washed
daily
with
a
two
per
cent
water
solution
of
a
coal
tar
disinfectant
until
healing
is
well
advanced
a
very
necessary
is
the
washing
of
the
part
after
two
or
three
days
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
dried
blood
the
opening
at
the
base
of
the
horn
communicates
directly
with
the
frontal
sinus
a
large
cavity
situated
between
the
two
plates
of
the
frontal
bone
sometimes
the
bone
is
slivered
or
the
wound
becomes
infected
and
inflamed
this
may
be
due
to
a
dirty
dehorning
saw
or
getting
dirt
into
the
wound
the
inflammation
may
extend
to
the
sinus
and
a
heavy
discharge
from
the
cavity
occur
this
complication
may
be
prevented
by
placing
the
saw
or
cutters
in
a
disinfectant
when
not
in
use
and
cleaning
and
disinfecting
the
wound
very
carefully
for
a
few
days
after
the
operation
horn
buttons
of
from
a
few
days
to
one
week
of
age
can
be
destroyed
and
the
growth
of
the
horn
prevented
by
applying
caustic
soda
or
potash
to
them
the
method
of
procedure
is
as
follows
clip
away
the
hair
from
around
the
base
of
the
horn
tissue
and
apply
a
little
vaseline
to
the
skin
near
but
not
close
to
the
base
of
the
horn
moisten
the
horn
button
and
rub
it
two
or
three
times
with
the
end
of
the
stick
of
caustic
do
not
allow
the
calf
to
go
out
in
the
rain
for
a
few
days
after
applying
the
caustic
the
horns
of
calves
a
few
weeks
of
age
may
be
removed
with
a
sharp
knife
or
calf
dehorner
this
is
a
common
accident
in
cattle
and
horses
the
object
that
causes
the
choke
may
be
lodged
in
the
pharynx
or
oesophagus
certain
individuals
are
more
prone
to
choke
while
feeding
than
others
this
is
because
of
their
habit
of
eating
greedily
and
swallowing
hastily
without
properly
mixing
the
bolus
with
the
saliva
for
this
reason
choking
occurs
when
the
animal
is
eating
dry
feed
cattle
frequently
become
choked
on
pieces
of
such
food
as
roots
and
apples
that
are
too
large
to
readily
pass
down
the
oesophagus
sharp
objects
taken
in
with
the
food
sometimes
become
lodged
in
the
oesophagus
or
pharynx
differ
in
complete
and
partial
choke
in
the
latter
the
symptoms
are
not
very
characteristic
the
animal
may
stop
feeding
but
shows
very
little
evidence
of
suffering
pain
it
may
be
able
to
swallow
a
little
water
on
attempting
to
drink
a
part
of
the
water
may
be
returned
through
the
nose
the
same
as
in
complete
choke
ineffectual
efforts
to
swallow
salivation
coughing
hurried
respiration
and
an
anxious
expression
of
the
face
occur
in
complete
choke
bloating
may
complicate
this
accident
in
ruminants
after
partial
choke
has
persisted
for
a
day
or
two
the
animal
appears
dejected
or
distressed
pressure
on
the
trachea
by
hard
objects
may
cause
difficult
respiration
mechanical
pneumonia
sometimes
occurs
this
is
due
to
the
food
and
water
that
the
animal
may
attempt
to
swallow
being
returned
to
the
pharynx
and
passed
into
the
air
passages
and
lungs
is
as
follows
animals
that
have
choked
should
not
be
given
access
to
feed
of
any
kind
any
attempt
to
take
food
or
drink
water
may
result
in
pneumonia
it
may
be
necessary
to
drench
the
animal
with
a
very
small
quantity
of
water
for
the
purpose
of
diagnosis
the
most
common
form
of
choke
in
horses
is
that
due
to
accumulation
of
dry
food
in
the
oesophagus
the
administration
of
a
drug
that
stimulates
the
secretion
of
saliva
is
a
very
successful
method
of
relieving
this
form
of
choke
pilocarpine
is
the
drug
commonly
used
cheap
whips
should
not
be
introduced
into
the
oesophagus
for
the
purpose
of
dislodging
the
foreign
body
there
is
always
danger
of
the
whip
becoming
broken
off
and
the
broken
part
lodging
in
the
oesophagus
neither
should
such
rigid
objects
as
a
broom
or
rake
handle
be
introduced
because
of
the
danger
from
serious
injury
to
the
walls
of
the
pharynx
and
oesophagus
the
flexible
probang
which
is
usually
made
of
spiral
wire
covered
with
leather
is
a
very
useful
instrument
to
relieve
choke
when
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
operator
if
the
object
causing
the
choke
is
situated
in
the
neck
portion
of
the
oesophagus
it
may
sometimes
be
moved
forward
or
toward
the
stomach
by
pressure
with
the
fingers
the
castration
of
the
male
is
a
common
operation
in
domestic
animals
the
purpose
of
the
operation
is
to
render
the
animal
more
useful
for
work
or
meat
production
at
which
the
operation
is
performed
varies
in
the
different
species
the
colt
is
usually
castrated
when
he
is
one
year
old
and
the
calf
pig
and
lamb
when
a
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
of
age
it
is
not
advisable
to
castrate
the
young
at
weaning
time
the
operation
and
the
weaning
together
may
temporarily
check
the
growth
of
the
animal
colts
that
are
undeveloped
and
in
poor
flesh
or
affected
with
colt
distemper
should
be
allowed
to
recover
before
they
are
operated
on
in
all
animals
it
is
advisable
to
wait
until
after
they
have
recovered
from
disease
and
become
thrifty
and
strong
the
spring
early
summer
and
fall
are
the
most
suitable
seasons
for
castrating
the
young
it
may
be
practised
during
the
hot
or
cold
months
of
the
year
with
little
danger
from
wound
infection
or
other
complications
providing
the
necessary
can
be
given
preparation
of
the
for
the
operation
by
withholding
all
feed
for
about
twelve
hours
is
very
advisable
if
this
is
practised
the
stomach
and
intestines
are
not
distended
with
feed
and
the
young
are
cleaner
easier
to
handle
and
suffer
less
from
castration
clean
quarters
and
surroundings
are
very
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
operation
instruments
are
sharp
knives
preferably
a
heavy
scalpel
and
a
bistoury
an
emasculator
for
large
and
mature
animals
and
surgeon
needles
and
suture
material
ropes
and
casting
harness
are
frequently
used
for
confining
and
casting
the
large
and
mature
animals
two
clean
pans
or
pails
filled
with
a
two
per
cent
water
solution
of
liquor
cresolis
compositus
or
an
equally
reliable
disinfectant
should
be
provided
for
cleaning
the
scrotum
and
neighboring
parts
and
the
instruments
pieces
of
absorbent
cotton
or
oakum
may
be
used
in
washing
and
cleaning
the
scrotum
the
instruments
should
be
sterilized
in
boiling
water
before
using
a
number
of
pigs
or
are
to
be
castrated
it
is
best
to
confine
them
in
a
small
clean
pen
this
enables
the
attendant
to
catch
them
quickly
and
without
unnecessary
excitement
or
exercise
they
should
be
taken
to
an
adjoining
pen
to
be
castrated
the
scrotum
should
be
washed
with
the
disinfectant
and
the
testicles
pressed
tightly
against
the
scrotal
wall
an
incision
parallel
with
the
middle
line
or
raphe
and
a
little
to
one
side
is
made
through
the
skin
and
the
coverings
of
the
testicle
and
the
testicle
pressed
out
through
the
incision
the
testicle
and
cords
are
then
pulled
well
out
and
the
cord
broken
off
with
a
quick
jerk
and
twist
or
scraped
off
with
a
knife
the
latter
method
is
to
be
preferred
in
large
lambs
if
the
operator
does
not
have
an
emasculator
the
incision
in
the
scrotum
should
be
extended
from
its
base
to
the
lowest
part
in
order
to
secure
perfect
drainage
may
be
castrated
in
the
standing
position
or
when
cast
and
held
on
the
side
the
method
of
operating
is
the
same
as
recommended
for
pigs
and
lambs
castration
of
the
may
be
performed
in
either
the
standing
position
or
when
cast
the
method
of
operating
is
the
same
as
practised
in
the
smaller
animals
with
the
exception
of
cutting
off
the
cord
the
emasculator
is
used
here
this
instrument
crushes
the
stump
of
the
cord
and
prevents
haemorrhage
from
the
cut
ends
of
the
careful
aseptic
precautions
must
be
observed
in
operating
on
colts
as
they
are
very
susceptible
to
wound
infection
and
peritonitis
the
of
the
testicular
cord
are
larger
in
the
adult
animals
and
the
danger
from
haemorrhage
is
greater
than
in
the
young
for
this
reason
it
is
advisable
to
use
an
emasculator
in
castrating
all
mature
animals
complications
following
the
from
the
wound
and
stump
of
cord
is
usually
unimportant
in
the
young
animals
serious
haemorrhage
from
the
vessels
of
the
cord
sometimes
occur
in
the
adult
and
a
persistent
haemorrhage
results
when
a
subcutaneous
vein
is
cut
in
making
the
incision
in
the
scrotum
this
complication
is
not
usually
serious
and
can
be
prevented
and
controlled
by
observing
proper
precautions
in
cutting
off
the
cord
or
by
picking
up
the
cut
ends
of
the
vessel
and
ligating
it
packing
the
scrotal
sack
with
sterile
gauze
or
absorbent
cotton
and
closing
the
incision
with
sutures
may
be
practised
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
this
form
of
haemorrhage
the
packing
should
be
removed
in
about
twelve
hours
infection
of
the
always
follows
castration
if
the
incision
is
small
and
the
operation
is
followed
by
swelling
of
the
neighboring
tissues
the
clotted
blood
wound
secretions
and
pus
become
penned
up
in
the
scrotal
sack
local
blood
poisoning
or
peritonitis
follows
this
is
not
an
uncommon
complication
it
can
be
prevented
by
aseptic
precautions
in
operating
and
insuring
good
drainage
by
extending
the
incision
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
scrotal
sac
the
scrotal
sac
always
contracts
down
and
becomes
more
or
less
swollen
within
a
day
or
two
following
castration
we
must
keep
this
in
mind
when
enlarging
the
opening
and
be
sure
and
make
it
plenty
large
to
permit
the
escape
of
the
infectious
matter
in
castrating
sheep
all
wool
in
the
region
of
the
scrotal
sac
should
be
clipped
off
as
this
interferes
with
drainage
from
the
wound
following
is
almost
as
essential
as
clean
quarters
lack
of
exercise
leads
to
in
the
region
of
the
scrotum
and
the
lips
of
the
incision
may
become
adhered
if
the
animal
is
at
rest
colts
and
all
mature
animals
that
are
confined
in
close
quarters
should
be
examined
within
hours
following
the
operation
and
the
condition
of
the
wound
noted
if
closed
the
hands
should
be
cleaned
and
disinfected
and
the
adhesion
broken
down
with
the
fingers
it
is
best
to
exercise
horses
daily
it
is
unsafe
to
expose
castrated
animals
to
cold
damp
chilly
weather
the
shock
and
soreness
resulting
from
the
operation
render
the
animal
highly
susceptible
to
pleurisy
and
pneumonia
this
is
especially
true
of
young
colts
or
may
complicate
the
operation
this
form
of
hernia
is
quite
frequently
met
with
in
pigs
and
only
occasionally
in
the
other
animals
this
complication
is
usually
overcome
by
practising
what
is
commonly
termed
the
covered
operation
the
pig
is
usually
held
or
hung
up
by
the
hind
legs
a
larger
animal
is
placed
on
its
back
the
hernia
is
reduced
by
manipulating
the
mass
of
intestines
with
the
fingers
so
that
they
drop
back
into
the
abdominal
cavity
the
part
is
carefully
cleaned
and
disinfected
and
an
incision
made
through
the
scrotal
wall
and
the
thin
covering
or
serous
sac
in
which
the
testicle
is
lodged
is
exposed
the
testicle
with
the
cord
and
covering
is
drawn
well
out
of
the
scrotum
and
held
by
an
attendant
the
operator
then
passes
a
needle
carrying
a
strong
silk
thread
through
the
cord
and
covering
below
the
point
where
he
intends
severing
it
the
needle
is
removed
and
the
cord
and
covering
ligated
at
this
point
the
cord
is
then
cut
off
about
an
inch
from
the
ligature
and
the
incision
in
the
scrotum
made
plenty
large
in
order
to
insure
drainage
it
is
very
essential
to
the
success
of
this
operation
that
the
animal
be
dieted
for
twelve
or
eighteen
hours
before
attempting
to
operate
the
consists
in
giving
the
animal
separate
quarters
and
feeding
a
light
diet
or
scirrhous
follow
infection
of
the
wound
usually
with
spores
of
a
certain
fungus
this
complication
more
often
follows
castration
of
cattle
and
pigs
than
of
colts
wrong
methods
of
operating
such
as
leaving
the
stump
of
the
cord
too
long
and
insufficient
drainage
for
the
pus
and
wound
secretions
are
the
factors
that
favor
this
complication
scirrhous
cords
or
fibrous
tumors
should
be
dissected
out
and
removed
before
they
have
become
large
and
begun
breaking
down
castration
of
ridgeling
or
cryptorchid
in
the
ridgeling
animal
one
or
both
of
the
testicles
have
not
descended
into
the
scrotal
sac
and
are
usually
lodged
in
the
inguinal
canal
or
abdominal
cavity
if
the
testicle
is
lodged
in
the
inguinal
canal
the
animal
is
termed
a
flanker
in
yearling
colts
the
testicular
cord
is
sometimes
short
and
the
testicle
is
situated
high
up
in
the
scrotum
and
inguinal
canal
in
examining
a
supposed
cryptorchid
colt
he
should
be
twitched
this
may
cause
the
testicle
to
descend
into
the
scrotum
the
castration
of
a
true
cryptorchid
requires
a
special
operation
when
properly
performed
and
the
animal
given
special
the
operation
is
not
followed
by
any
serious
complications
an
abnormally
large
diseased
testicle
is
sometimes
met
with
that
can
not
be
removed
in
the
usual
way
and
which
complicates
and
increases
the
difficulty
of
operating
the
castration
or
caponizing
of
the
male
chicken
is
commonly
practised
in
certain
localities
this
operation
changes
the
disposition
of
the
cockerel
he
becomes
more
quiet
and
sluggish
never
crows
the
head
is
small
the
comb
and
wattles
cease
growing
and
the
hackle
and
saddle
feathers
become
well
developed
a
capon
always
develops
more
uniformly
and
is
larger
than
the
cockerel
best
time
to
caponize
the
is
when
he
weighs
between
two
or
three
pounds
if
older
and
heavier
the
testicle
becomes
so
large
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
remove
and
the
danger
from
tearing
the
spermatic
artery
and
a
fatal
haemorrhage
resulting
is
greater
there
are
several
kinds
of
they
may
be
purchased
in
sets
each
set
should
contain
an
instrument
for
removing
the
testicle
a
knife
for
making
the
incision
through
the
abdominal
wall
a
sharp
hook
for
tearing
through
the
thin
membrane
spring
spreader
for
holding
the
lips
of
the
incision
apart
a
blunt
probe
for
keeping
the
intestines
out
of
the
way
of
the
operator
and
a
pair
of
tweezers
for
removing
clots
of
blood
the
different
instruments
for
removing
the
testicles
are
a
scoop
spoon
forceps
and
cannula
the
scoop
is
preferred
by
most
operators
is
confined
for
the
operation
by
passing
a
strong
noose
of
cord
around
both
legs
and
a
second
noose
around
the
wings
close
to
the
body
that
have
weights
fastened
to
them
the
cords
pass
through
holes
or
loops
in
a
barrel
or
board
that
is
used
for
an
operating
table
this
holds
the
cockerel
firmly
and
prevents
his
struggling
bird
should
be
for
the
operation
by
withholding
all
feed
and
water
for
a
period
of
hours
or
longer
for
the
purpose
of
emptying
out
the
intestine
the
operator
must
have
a
strong
light
in
order
to
work
quickly
and
safely
direct
sunlight

general
method
of
is
as
follows
the
incision
is
made
between
the
last
two
ribs
and
in
front
of
the
thigh
the
feathers
over
this
region
should
be
removed
and
the
skin
pulled
to
one
side
before
making
the
incision
an
incision
about
one

inches
in
length
is
made
through
the
skin
and
muscles

inserted
the
sharp
hook

are
common
causes
of
skin
diseases
in
domestic
animals
the
diseased
conditions
of
the
skin
and
the
irritation
that
they
may
cause
the
animal
depend
on
the
life
history
and
habits
of
the
parasite
species
that
are
unable
to
live
independently
of
a
host
and
are
permanent
parasites
are
usually
the
most
injurious
to
the
animal
this
is
especially
true
of
parasites
that
are
capable
of
puncturing
the
skin

burrowing
into

temporary
parasites

cause
fatal
forms
of

the
different
methods
of
destroying

are
clipping

scraping
off

by
washing
the
part
infested
with

with
a
two

may
be
practised
for
the
prevention
of
the
the
most
practical
method
of
ridding
cattle
of
this
pest
is
to
destroy
the
larvae
this
can
be
done
by
examining
each
animal
and
locating
the
swelling
or
warble
and
injecting
a
few
drops
of
kerosene
into
the
opening
in
the
skin
a
better
method
is
to
enlarge
the
opening
in
the
skin
with
a
sharp
knife
squeeze
out
the
grub
and
destroy
it
this
should
be
practised
in
late
winter
and
early
spring
the
application
of
pine
tar
to
the
nostrils
of

is
the
most
practical
method

treatment
of
the
preventive
treatment
is
very
important
this
consists
in
carefully
examining
all
animals
or
birds
that
have
been
purchased
recently
and
if
found
to
harbor
lice
excluding
them
from
the
herd

flock
until
after
they
have
been
properly
treated
it
is
impossible
to
rid
animals
of
lice
if
the
quarters
are
thoroughly
cleaned
and
disinfected
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
destroy
lice
that
have
become
scattered
about
by
the
lousy
animals
and
prevent
the
reinfection
of
the
treated
animals
the
best
method
to
use
in
cleaning
the
quarters
is
to
remove
all
litter
and
manure
from
the
stable
or
houses
and
their
immediate
surroundings
it
should
be
burned
or
hauled
to
a
field
or
lot
where
other
animals
can
not
come
in
contact
with
it
for
a
few
months
the
walls
floors

partitions
should
be
sprayed

may
be
scattered
about
the
buildings

the
most
satisfactory
method
of
destroying

bodies
of
animals
is
by
washing

mixture
of
some
reliable
disinfectant

does
not
depend
on
the

probably
dusty

responsible
in
large
degree
for

the
first
symptom
is
a

are
responsible
for
the
mildness
of

the
treatment
that
is
of

importance
is
clean
quarters
and
the
feeding
of
a

that
will
keep
the

term
commonly

these
infectious
diseases
are
by
several
different
species
of
bacteria
that
gain
entrance

by
way
of
wounds
the
bacteria
that
cause
pyaemia
are
transferred
by
the
blood
stream
to
different
organs
and
produce
multiple
abscesses
in
septicaemia
the
bacteria
may
occur
in
immense
numbers
in
the
blood
and
produce
a
general
infection
of
the
tissues
causing

preventive
treatment
consists
in
quarantining

avian
diphtheria
roup
this
infectious
disease
of
poultry
is
especially
common
in
chickens
it
is
characterized
by
a
catarrhal
and
diphtheritic
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membranes
of
the
head
specific
cause
of
has

sick
birds
birds
having
a
mild
form
of
roup
or
that
have
recently
recovered
from
it
are
common
carriers
of
the
disease
the
disease
is
usually
introduced
into
the
flock
by
allowing
birds
exposed
at
poultry
shows
or
recently
purchased
breeding
stock
from
an
infected
flock
to
mix

the
healthy
birds

very
important
factors

usually
the
first
symptoms
noticed
are

the
eyelids
may
become
swollen

membranes
if
the
mouth
is
examined
at
this
time
an
accumulation
of
mucus
and
patches
of
diphtheritic
or
false
membranes
are
found
in
the
acute
form
of
roup
the
false
membranes
and
yellowish
material
accumulate
on
the
different
mucous
membranes
and
interfere
with
vision
breathing
and
digestion
the
affected
bird
becomes
thin
and
weak
the
death
rate
is
very
high
in
this
form
of
the
disease
preventive
consists
in
quarantining
birds
that
have
been
purchased
from
other
flocks
and
that
have
been
exhibited
for
a
period
of
three
weeks
a
careful
examination
of
the
mouth
should
be
made
if
a
catarrhal
discharge
from
the
nostrils
and
false
membranes
is
present
prompt
treatment
should
be
used
a
sick
bird
should
be
held
in
quarantine
for
several
weeks
after
it
has
recovered
and
receive
a
thorough
washing
in
a
two
per
cent
water
solution
of
a
cresol
disinfectant
before
allowing
it
to
mix
with
the
healthy
birds
the
medicinal
treatment
consists
in
removing
the
discharges
from
the
nostrils
and
eyes
with
pledgets
of
absorbent
cotton
that
are
soaked
with
a
four
per
cent
water
solution
of
boric
acid
among
the
common
treatments
mentioned
are
boric
acid
and
calomel
equal
parts
by
weight
blown
into
the
nostrils
and
eyes
with
a
powder
blower
water
solutions
of
boric
acid
potassium
permanganate
and
hydrogen
peroxide
are
recommended
liquid
preparations
are
applied
with
pledgets
of
cotton
oil
cans
or
atomizers
many
recoveries
can
be
obtained
with
careful
treatment
it
is
usually
most
economical
to
kill
the
severely
affected
birds
many
poultrymen
dispose
of
the
entire
flock
as
soon
as
the
disease
makes
its
appearance
and
clean
and
disinfect
the
premises
before
restocking
in
some
sections
the
disease
appears
in
another
form
known
as
contagious
epithelioma
in
which
nodules
form
on
the
skin
along
the
base
of
the
comb
and
other
parts
of
the
head
or
both
forms
may
be
met
with
in
the
same
flock
the
nodules
should
be
treated
with
vaseline
or
glycerine
ointments
containing
two
per

of
any
of
the
common
antiseptics
or
disinfectants

be
used
in
eliminating

this
consists
in
killing

showing
visible
symptoms
moving
the
apparently
healthy
portion
of
the
flock
to
new
quarters
and
wiping

then
allowed
to
stand
empty
for
several
months

should
again
spray
with
a
disinfectant
and
scatter

disinfecting
have
been
thorough
we
