the
french
character
the
american
character
is
now
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
cosmopolitan
of
modern
times
and
a
native
of
this
country
all
things
being
equal
is
likely
to
form
a
less
prescriptive
idea
of
other
nations
than
the
inhabitants
of
countries
whose
neighborhood
and
history
unite
to
bequeathe
and
perpetuate
certain
fixed
notions
before
the
frequent
intercourse
now
existing
between
europe
and
the
united
states
we
derived
our
impressions
of
the
french
people
as
well
as
of
italian
skies
from
english
literature
the
probability
was
that
our
earliest
association
with
the
gallic
race
partook
largely
of
the
ridiculous
all
the
extravagant
anecdotes
of
morbid
miserly
epicurism
strained
courtesy
and
frivolous
absurdity
current
used
to
boast
a
frenchman
as
their
hero
it
was
so
in
novels
plays
and
stories
our
first
personal
acquaintance
often
confirmed
this
prejudice
for
the
chance
was
that
the
one
specimen
of
the
grand
nation
familiar
to
our
childhood
proved
a
poor
who
gained
a
precarious
livelihood
as
a
cook
teacher
or
barber
who
was
profuse
of
smiles
shrugs
bows
and
compliments
prided
himself
on
belle
played
the
fiddle
and
took
snuff
a
more
dignified
view
succeeded
when
we
read
télémaque
so
long
an
initiatory
in
the
study
of
the
language
blended
as
its
crystal
style
was
in
our
imaginations
with
the
pure
and
noble
character
of
fénelon
perhaps
the
next
link
in
the
chain
of
our
estimate
was
supplied
by
the
bust
of
voltaire
whose
withered
sneering
physiognomy
embodies
the
wit
and
indifference
the
soulless
vagabondage
that
forms
the
worst
side
of
the
national
mind
as
patriotic
sentiment
awakened
the
disinterested
enthusiasm
of
lafayette
woven
as
it
is
into
the
record
of
the
struggle
which
gave
birth
to
our
republic
yielded
another
and
more
attractive
element
to
the
fancy
portrait
then
as
our
reading
expanded
came
the
tragic
chronicle
of
the
first
french
revolution
and
the
brilliant
and
dazzling
melodrama
of
napoleon
the
traditions
so
pathetic
and
sublime
of
gifted
women
the
so
exciting
to
a
youthful
temper
of
military
glory
and
thus
by
degrees
we
found
ourselves
bewildered
by
the
most
vivid
contrasts
and
apparently
irreconcilable
traits
until
the
original
idea
of
a
frenchman
expanded
to
the
widest
range
of
associations
from
the
ingenious
devices
of
a
mysterious
to
the
brilliant
manoeuvres
of
the
infinite
female
tact
rare
philosophic
hardihood
inimitable
exquisite
millinery
consummate
generalship
holy
fortitude
refined
profligacy
and
intoxicating
sentiment
ude
napoleon
madame
récamier
pascal
ninon
de
and
rousseau
casual
associations
and
desultory
reading
thus
predispose
us
to
recognize
something
half
comical
and
half
enchanting
in
french
life
and
it
depends
on
accident
when
we
first
visit
paris
which
view
is
confirmed
the
society
of
one
of
those
benign
who
attract
the
sympathy
and
win
the
admiration
of
young
students
may
yield
a
delightful
and
noble
association
to
our
future
reminiscences
or
an
unmodified
experience
of
cynical
hearts
joined
to
scenical
manners
may
leave
us
nothing
to
regret
upon
our
departure
save
the
material
advantages
there
enjoyed
but
whoever
knows
life
in
paris
unrelieved
by
some
consistent
and
individual
purpose
will
find
it
a
succession
of
excitements
temporary
yet
varied
full
of
the
agreeable
yet
barren
of
consecutive
interest
and
satisfactory
results
admirable
as
a
recreative
hygiene
deplorable
as
a
permanent
resource
their
inevitable
consequence
being
a
faith
in
the
external
a
dependence
on
the
immediate
and
a
habit
of
vagrant
which
must
at
last
cloy
and
harden
the
manly
soul
for
this
very
reason
however
the
scenes
characters
and
society
there
exhibited
are
prolific
of
suggestion
to
the
philosophic
mind
in
every
phase
of
life
manners
and

we
see
a
characteristic

in

the
superiority
of
the
french
in
the
minor
philosophy
of
life
was
curiously
exemplified
during
our
revolutionary
war
the
octogenarians
of
rhode
island
used
to
expatiate
on
the
remarkable
difference
between
the
troops
of
france
and
those
of
england
when
quartered
among
them
the
former
speedily
made
a
series
of
little
arrangements
and
fell
naturally
into
a
pleasant
routine
making
the
best
of
everything
adapting
themselves
to
the
ways
and
prejudices
of
the
inhabitants
and
in
a
word
becoming
assimilated
at
once
to
a
new
mode
of
life
and
form
of
society
their
wit
cheerfulness
and
gallantry
are
yet
proverbial
in
that
region
the
english
on
the
other
hand
even
when
in
full
possession
of
the
country
made
but
an
awkward
use
of
their
privileges
were
failed
to
recognize
anything
genial
in
the
habits
and
manners
even
of
the
tory
families
while
the
french
officers
introduced
the
mysteries
of
their
and
brightened
many
a
rustic
household
with
song
anecdote
dance
and
conversation
the
english
complained
of
the

and

and
made
themselves
and
their
hosts
whether
forced
or
voluntary
uncomfortable
they
exhibited
no
tact
or
facility
in
improving
the
resources
at
hand
and
relied
only
on
brute
force
to
win
advantage
we
beheld
the
same
contrast
recently
in
the
crimea
while
exposure
and
impatience
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
brave
islanders
their
gallic
allies
constructed
roads
dug
where
they
could
not
build
a
shelter
and
ingeniously
prepared
various
dishes
from
a
meagre
larder
fighting
off
meantime
chagrin
and
with
as
much
alacrity
as
they
did
cossacks
characterizes
servants
not
less
than
courtiers
the
as
well
as
the
notary
the
composition
of
a
dish
as
well
as
the
drift
of
a
comedy
this
quality
seems
a
result
of
the
conflict
of
intelligences
in
a
state
of
great
material
civilization
nowhere
is
it
more
observable
than
in
paris
life
what
bullyism
is
to
the
english
shrewdness
to
the
yankee
and
intrigue
to
the
italian
is
which
is
a
union
of
insight
and
address
to
the
french
this
normal
attribute
is
another
proof
how
the
economy
of
gallic
life
is
reduced
to
an
art
it
is
the
expression
in

of
rochefoucauld

of

cunning
it
is
favored
by
the
tendency

of

to
understand
what
superior
range
is
afforded
to
such
a
principle
in

it
is
only
requisite
to
consult
the
memoirs
of
a
celebrated
woman

even
an
old

or
picture
of

she
will
not

the
maxims

prevalent

declare

are
the
legitimate
result
of
a
superficial
theory

the
mutual

it
is
a
curious
illustration
at
once
of
the
mobility
and
the
isolation
of
the
french
mind
that
while
it
assimilates
elements
within
its
sphere
which
in
other
nations
are
kept
comparatively
apart
it
rejects
the
process
in
regard
to
foreign
material
thus
in
no

so
interwoven

the
social
history
of
an
epoch
necessarily
includes
the
genius
of
its
statesmanship
and
of
its
letters
because
they
are
identified
with
the
intrigues
and
the
conversation
of
the
period
more
is
to
be
learned
at

lady

than
in

on
the
other
hand
how
few
threads
from
abroad
can
be
found
in
this
mingled
web
of
civic
literary
and
social
life
the
vicinity
of
england
and
the
influx
of
englishmen
have
scarcely
brought
the
ideas
or
the
sentiment
of
that
country
into
nearer
recognition
at

was
the
case
a
century

notwithstanding

occasional
outbreak

anglomania
the

the
best
french

and
the

of
parisians

the
characteristics
of
their
insular
neighbors
than
before
the

the
attempts
to
represent

gross
caricatures
now

apt
at
fusion
within
the
national
egotism
is
as
repugnant
to
assimilation
from

as
ever
the
stock
seems
incapable
of
vital
grafting
as
has
been
remarkably
evidenced
in
all
the
colonial
experiments
of
france
the
excellence
of
the
french
character
intellectually
speaking
consists
in
routine
and
detail
how
well
their
authors
describe
and
their
artists
depict
peculiarities
how
exact
the
evolutions
of
a
french
regiment
and
the
statements
of
a
french
naturalist
how
apt
is
a
parisian
woman
in
raising
gracefully
her
skirts
throwing
on
a
shawl
or
carrying
a
basket
in
loyalty
to
a
method
they
are
unrivalled
in
the
triumph
of
individualities
weak
their
artisans
can
make

to

the

not

much
the

the

for

long
period
the
man
of

was
never
combined
with
the

as
in
england
in
france
speculation
in
government
ran
wild
because
the
thinkers
suddenly
raised
to
influence
in
affairs
had
enjoyed
no
ordeal
of
public
duty
hence
certain
imaginary
fruits
of
liberty
were
sought
and
its
absolute
worth
misunderstood
and
now
that
experience
dearly
bought
has
modified
visionary
and
moulded
practical
theories
how
much
of
the
normal
interest
of
the
french

has
evaporated

eclipsed

of

the
anomalous

there

so
extreme

always
better

than
was
anticipated
now
below
the
level
of

now
far
above

so
unchangeable
in
its
leading
features
that
it
may
be
recognized
by
portraits
drawn
two
or
three
thousand
years
ago
and
yet
so
fickle
in
its
daily
opinions
and
tastes
that
it
becomes
at
last
a
mystery
to
itself
and
is
as
much
astonished
as
strangers
at
the
sight
of
what
it
has
done
naturally
fond
of
home
and
routine
yet
when
once
driven
forth
and
forced
to
adopt
new
customs
ready
to
carry
principles
to
any
lengths
and
to
dare
anything
indocile
by
disposition
but
better
pleased
with
the
arbitrary
and
even
violent
rule
of
a
sovereign

with

under
its

now
fixed
in
hostility

subjection
of

now
so
passionately
wedded

servitude
that

can
not

led
by
a
thread
so
long
as
no
word
of
resistance
is
spoken
wholly
ungovernable
when
the
standard
of
revolt
is
raised
thus
always
deceiving
its
masters
who
fear
it
too
much
or
too
little
never
so
free
that
it
can
not
be
subjugated
never
so
kept
down
that
it

not
break

prone

worship
chance

comedy
is
native
to
french
genius
and
appreciation
it
follows
the
changes
of
social
life
with
marvellous
celerity
it
is
the
best
school
of
the
french
language
and
is
refined
and
subdivided
as
an
art
both
in
degree
and
kind
in
france
more
than
in
any
other
country
the
prolific
authors
in
this
department
and
the
variety
and
richness
of
invention
they
display
as
well
as
the
permanent
attraction
of
the
comic
muse
are
striking
peculiarities
of
the
french
theatre
no
capital
affords
the
material
and
the
audience
requisite
for
such
triumphs
like
paris
and
there
is
always
a
play
of
this
kind
in
vogue
there
wherein
novelty
of
combination
significance
of
dialogue
and
artistic
felicities
quite
unrivalled
elsewhere
are
exhibited
it
is
quite
the
reverse
with
the
serious
drama
in
england
this
is
a
form
of
literature
which
goes
nearest
to
the
normal
facts
and
conditions
of
human
nature
it
teaches
the
highest
and
deepest
lessons
wins
the
most
profound
sympathy
and
is
remarkable
and
interesting
through
its
subtile
and
comprehensive
truth
to
nature
whereas
in
france
the
masters
of
tragic
art
are
but
skilful
reproducers
of
the
classical
drama
french
tragedy
is
essentially
artificial
grafted
on
the
conventionalities
of
a
distant
age
it
gives
scope
either
to
mere
elocutionary
art
or
melodramatic
invention
not
to
the
universal
and
existing
passions
there
is
but
a
slender
opportunity
to
identify
our
sympathies
those
of
modern
civilization
with
what
is
going
on
figures
in
roman
togas
or
grecian
mantles
rehearse
the
sentiments
of
fatalism
the
creed
of
ancient
mythology
or
gallic
rhetoric
in
a
classic
dress
and
these
disguises
so
envelope
the
love
ambition
despair
hate
or
patriotism
that
we
are
always
conscious
of
the
theatrical
and
it
requires
the
extraordinary
gifts
of
a
rachel
to
enlist
other
than
artistic
interest
the
french
have
manuals
for
breathing
and
composing
the
features
to
secure
artistic
effects
they
offer
academic
prizes
for
every
conceivable
achievement

quiets

murmur
about
to
rise
against
interference
with
human
rights
or
usurpation
of
the
national
will
political
interests
of
the
gravest
character
are
treated
with
flippancy
one
writer
calls
the
formation
of
a
new
government

of
whist
and
another
casually
observes
that
les
gouvernements

ont
leur

that
great
principle
of
the
division
of
labor
which
the
english
carry
into
mechanical
and
commercial
affairs
the
french
also
apply
to
the
economy
of
life
and
to
art
but
as
these
latter
interests
are
more
spontaneous
and
unlimited
the
result
is
often
a
perfection
in
detail
and
a
like
deficiency
in
general
effect
thus
there
are
schools
of
painting
in
france
more
distinct
and
apart
than
exist
elsewhere
usually
the
followers
of
such
are
distinguished
for
excellence
in
the
mechanical
aptitudes
of
their
vocation
the
figure
is
admirably
drawn
the
costume
rightly
disposed
and
sometimes
the
degree
of
finish
quite
marvellous
but
usually
this
superiority
is
attained
at
the
expense
of
the
sentiment
of
the
picture
french
historic
art
like
french
life
is
apt
to
be
extravagant
and
melodramatic
or
in
unimportant
particulars
it
often
lacks
moral
harmony
the
grand
simple
true
reflection
of
nature
in
its
nicety
delaroche
who
of
all
french
painters
rose
most
above
the
adventitious
and
gave
himself
to
the
soul
of
art
to
pure
expression
was
for
this
very
reason
thought
by
his
brother
artists
to
be
cold
and
unattractive
there
is
one
sphere
however
where
this
exclusiveness
of
style
and
partition
of
labor
are
productive
of
the
most
felicitous
results
namely
the
minor
drama
in
england
and
america
the
same
theatre
exhibits
opera
melodrama
tragedy
comedy
and
legerdemain
but
in
paris
each
branch
and
element
of
histrionic
art
has
its
separate
temple
its
special
corps
of
actors
and
authors
nay
its
particular
class
of
subjects
hence
their
unrivalled
perfection
ingenuity
science
and
art
are
concentrated
by
thus
assigning
free
and
individual
scope
to
the
dramatic
niceties
and
phases
of
life
of
history
of
genius
and
of
society
at
the
opera
comique
you
find
one
kind
of
musical
creation
at
the
italiens
the
lyrical
drama
of
southern
europe
alone
at
the
variétés
a
unique
order
of
comic
dialogue
and
at
the
porte
martin
yet
another
species
of
play
one
theatre
gives
back
the
identical
tone
of
existing
society
and
current
events
another
deals
with
the
classical
ideas
of
the
past
satire
and
song
the
horrible
and
the
brilliant
the
graceful
and
the
highly
artistic
pictorial
elocutionary
pantomimic
tragic
vocal
statuesque
the
past
and
present
all
the
elements
of
art
and
of
life
find
representation
in
the
plot
the
language
the
sentiment
the
costume
the
music
and
the
scenery
of
the
many
parisian
theatres
yet
how
much
of
this
superiority
is
fugitive
how
little
in
the
whole
dramatic
development
takes
permanent
hold
upon
popular
sympathy
much
of
its
significance
is
purely
local
and
of
its
interest
altogether
temporary
scholars
and
the
higher
classes
can
talk
eloquently
of
corneille
and
racine
the
beaux
and
women
of
the
day
can
repeat
and
enjoy
the
last
hit
of
scribe
or
the
new
of
the
theatre
but
contrast
these
results
with
the
national
love
and
appreciation
of
shakspeare
with
the
permanent
reflection
of
spanish
life
in
lope
de
vega
the
patriotic
aspirations
which
the
young
italian
broods
over
in
the
tragedies
of
alfieri
the
grace
of
movement
the
triumph
of
tact
and
ingenuity
the
devotion
to
conventionalism
either
pedantry
or
the
genius
of
the
hour
also
rules
the
drama
in
paris
with
all
its
brilliancy
entertainment
grace
wit
and
popularity
there
exists
not
a
permanently
vital
and
universally
recognized
type
of
this
greatest
department
of
literature
familiar
and
endeared
alike
to
peasant
and
peer
a
representative
of
humanity
for
all
time
like
the
bard
around
whose
name
and
words
cluster
the
hearts
and
intelligence
from
generation
to
generation
but
nowhere
do
life
and
the
drama
so
trench
upon
each
other
nowhere
is
every
incident
of
experience
so
dramatic
miss
williams
told
the
poet
rogers
that
she
had
seen
men
and
women
waiting
for
admission
at
the
door
of
the
theatre
suddenly
leave
their
station
on
the
passing
of
a
set
of
wretches
going
to
be
guillotined
and
then
having
ascertained
that
none
of
their
relations
or
friends
were
among
them
very
unconcernedly
return
to
the
door
of
the
theatre
a
child
is
born
at
the
opera
comique
during
the
performance
and
it
is
instantly
made
an
event
of
sympathy
and
effect
by
the
audience
a
subscription
is
raised
the
child
named
for
the
dramatic
heroine
of
the
moment
and
the
fortunate
mother
sent
home
in
a
carriage
amid
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
you
are
listening
to
a
play
and
a
copy
of
the
is
thrust
into
your
hand
containing
a
minute
account
of
the
death
of
a
statesman
two
squares
off
whose
name
fills
pages
of
history
or
a
battle
in
the
east
where
some
officer
whom
you
met
two
months
before
on
the
boulevard
has
won
immortal
fame
by
prodigies
of
valor
so
do
the
actualities
and
the
pastimes
the
real
and
the
imaginary
drama
miraculously
interfuse
at
paris
the
comedy
of
life
is
patent
there
and
often
the
spectator
exclaims
avait
bien
arrangé
les
choses
mais
colombine
dérange
tout
the
parisian
females
are
unexceptionably
shod
but
the
agricultural
instruments
now
in
use
in
the
rural
districts
of
france
are
of
a
form
and
mechanism
which
to
a
yankee
farmer
would
seem
antediluvian
the
cooks
gardeners
and
other
have
annually
the
most
graceful
festivals
but
the
traveller
sees
in
the
fields
women
so
bronzed
and
wrinkled
by
toil
and
exposure
that
their
sex
is
hardly
to
be
recognized
when
the
gothamite
passes
along
pearl
or
broad
street
he
beholds
the
daily
spectacle
of
unemployed
carmen
reading
newspapers
there
may
be
said
to
be
no
such
thing
as
popular
literature
in
france
mental
recreation
such
as
the
german
and
scotch
peasantry
enjoy
is
unknown
there
the
art
and
letters
of
the
kingdom
flourished
in
her
court
and
were
cultivated
as
an
aristocratic
element
for
so
long
a
period
that
neither
has
become
domesticated
among
the
lower
classes
we
find
in
them
the
sentiment
of
military
glory
of
religion
in
its
superstitious
phase
of
music
perhaps
of
rustic
festivity
but
not
the
enjoyments
which
spring
from
or
are
associated
with
thought
and
poetic
sympathies
such
as
national
writers
like
burns
inspired
an
exception
comparatively
recent
may
be
found
in
the
popular
appreciation
of
béranger
and
souvestre
there
is
not
a
natural
object
too
beautiful
or
an
occasion
too
solemn
to
arrest
the
french
tendency
to
the
theatrical
even
one
of
their
most
ardent
eulogists
remarks
all
that
can
be
said
against
the
french
sublime
is
this
that
the
grandeur
is
more
in
the
word
than
in
the
thing
the
french
expression
professes
more
than
it
performs
and
old
montaigne
declares
that
lying
is
not
a
vice
among
the
french
a
way
of
both
observations
admit
too
much
and
indicate
an
habitual
departure
from
nature
and
simplicity
as
a
national
trait
who
but
frenchmen
ever
delighted
in
reducing
to
artificial
shapes
the
graceful
forms
of
vegetable
life
or
can
so
far
lay
aside
the
sentiment
of
grief
as
to
engage
in
rhetorical
panegyrics
over
the
fresh
graves
of
departed
friends
compare
the
high
dead
wall
with
its
range
of
the
porches
undecked
by
woodbines
or
jessamine
the
formal
paths
the
proximate
kitchen
stables
and
ungarnished
of
a
french
villa
with
the
hedges
meadows
woodlands
and
trellised
eglantine
of
an
english
and
a
glance
assures
us
that
to
the
former
nation
the
country
is
a
and
not
an
endeared
seclusion
yet
they
romance
in
their
way
on
rural
subjects
la
says
one
of
their
poets
chaque
feuille
qui
tombe
est
une
élégie
toute
through
an
avenue
of
scraggy
poplars
we
approach
a
dilapidated
whose
owner
is
playing
dominoes
at
the
café
of
the
nearest
provincial
town
or
exhausting
the
sparse
revenues
of
the
estate
at
the
theatres
or
balls
of
paris
people
leave
these
for
a
rural
vicinage
only
to
economize
to
hide
chagrin
or
to
die
so
recognized
is
this
indifference
to
nature
and
inaptitude
for
rural
life
in
france
that
when
we
desire
to
express
the
opposite
of
natural
tastes
we
habitually
use
the
word
frenchified
the
idea
which
a
parisian
has
of
a
tree
is
that
of
a
convenient
appendage
to
a
lamp
the
traveller
never
sees
artificial
light
reflected
from
green
leaves
without
thinking
of
his
evening
promenades
in
the
french
capital
or
a
dance
in
the
groves
of
montmorency
the
old
verbal
tyranny
of
the
french
academy
the
painted
wreaths
sold
at
the
colored
plates
of
fashions
powdered
hair
and
rouged
cheeks
typify
and
illustrate
this
irreverent
ambition
to
pervert
nature
and
create
artificial
effects
they
are
but
so
many
forms
of
the
theatrical
instinct
and
proofs
of
the
ascendency
of
meretricious
taste
it
is
this
want
of
loyalty
to
nature
and
insensibility
to
her
unadulterated
charms
which
constitute
the
real
barrier
between
the
gallic
mind
and
that
of
england
and
italy
and
which
explain
the
fervent
protest
of
such
men
as
alfieri
and
coleridge
simplicity
and
earnestness
are
the
normal
traits
of
efficient
character
whether
developed
in
action
or
art
in
sentiment
or
reflection
and
manufactured
verse
vegetation
and
complexions
indicate
a
faith
in
appearances
and
a
divorce
from
reality
which
in
political
interests
tend
to
compromise
to
theory
and
to
acquiescence
in
a
military
and
an
embellished
absolutism
it
is
this
incompleteness
this
comparative
untruth
that
gives
rise
to
the
dissatisfaction
we
feel
in
the
last
analysis
of
french
character
it
is
delusive
the
promise
of
beauty
held
out
by
external
taste
is
unfulfilled
the
fascination
of
manner
bears
a
vastly
undue
proportion
to
the
substantial
kindness
and
trust
which
that
immediate
charm
suggests
just
heaven
exclaims
yorick
for
what
wise
reasons
hast
thou
ordered
it
that
beggary
and
urbanity
which
are
at
such
variance
in
other
countries
should
find
a
way
to
be
at
unity
in
this
the
bearing
of
an
englishman
seldom
awakens
expectation
of
courtesy
or
entertainment
yet
if
vouchsafed
how
to
be
relied
on
is
the
friendship
how
generous
the
hospitality
the
urbane
salutation
with
which
a
frenchman
greets
the
female
passenger
as
she
enters
a
public
conveyance
is
not
followed
by
the
offer
of
his
seat
or
a
slice
of
his
reeking
while
the
roughest
backwoodsman
in
america
who
never
touched
his
hat
or
inclined
his
body
to
a
stranger
will
guard
a
woman
from
insult
and
incommode
himself
to
promote
her
comfort
with
respectful
alacrity
it
is
so
in
literature
how
often
we
eagerly
follow
the
clear
exposition
of
a
subject
in
the
pages
of
a
french
author
to
reach
an
impotent
conclusion
or
suffer
our
sympathies
to
be
enlisted
by
the
admirable
description
of
an
interior
or
a
character
in
one
of
their
novels
to
find
the
plot
which
embodies
them
an
absurd
melodrama
evanescence
is
the
law
of
parisian
felicities
selfishness
the
background
of
french
politeness
sociability
flourishes
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
attachment
we
become
skeptical
almost
in
proportion
as
we
are
attracted
if
we
ask
the
way
we
are
graciously
directed
but
if
we
demand
the
least
sacrifice
we
must
accept
volubility
for
service
thus
the
perpetual
flowering
in
manners
in
philosophy
in
politics
and
in
economy
is
rarely
accompanied
by
fruit
in
either
to
enjoy
paris
we
must
cease
to
be
in
earnest
to
pass
the
time
and
not
to
wrest
from
it
a
blessing
or
a
triumph
is
the
main
object
the
badges
the
gardens
the
smiles
the
agreeable
phrase
the
keen
repartee
the
tempting
dish
the
ingenious
the
pretty
foot
the
elegant
chair
and
becoming
curtain
the
extravagant
gesture
the
pointed
epigram
or
alluring
formula
must
be
taken
as
so
many
agreeabilities
not
for
things
performed
but
imaginatively
promised
the
folly
of
war
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
entire
sense
of
mankind
at
best
it
is
now
deemed
a
painful
necessity
yet
the
most
serious
phase
of
life
in
france
is
military
depth
and
refinement
of
feeling
are
lonely
growths
and
can
no
more
spring
up
in
a
gregarious
and
festal
life
than
trees
in
quicksands
citizenship
is
based
on
consistent
acts
not
on
verbosity
and
brilliant
accompaniments
never
reconcile
strong
hearts
to
the
loss
of
independence
which
some
english
author
has
acutely
declared
the
first
essential
of
a
gentleman
the
civilization
of
france
is
an
artistic
and
scientific
materialism
the
spiritual
element
is
wanting
paris
is
the
theatre
of
nations
we
must
regard
it
as
a
continuous
spectacle
a
boundless
museum
a
place
of
diversion
of
study
not
of
faith
the
deepest
want
and
most
sacred
birthright
of
humanity
the
want
of
directness
the
absence
of
candor
the
of
truth
in
its
broad
and
deep
sense
is
indeed
a
characteristic
phase
of
life
of
expression
and
of
manners

of
this
theatrical
instinct
and
development
herein
may
we
find
a
key
to
the
riddle
of
governmental
vicissitudes
in
france
people
so
easily
satisfied
with
illusions
so
fertile
in
superficial
expedients
are
like
children

savages
in
their
sense
of
what
is
novel
and

and
their
love
of
excitement
and
make
no
such
demands
upon

citizens
instinctively

this

not
been
disciplined

wants

vaguely
realized
accustomed
to
look
out
of
themselves
for
a
law

consult
authority
upon

occasion
to
defer
to
official
sources
for
guidance

detail
of

de
tocqueville
has
remarked
that
in

instance
of
attempted
colonization
they
have
adapted
themselves
to
instead
of
elevating
savage
tribes
they
have
never
gone
through
the
process

inevitable
claim

like
the
hence
their
need
of
a
master
and
the
feeling
of
stability
realized
among
them
only
under
legitimacy
and
despotism
shallow
reasoners
argue
from
the
mere
acknowledgment
of
this
state
of
things
that
it
is
an
ultimate
public
blessing
when
the
man
appears
with
wit
and
will
enough
to
regulate
and
keep
from
chaos
a
society
thus
destitute
of
political
training
but
those
who
look
deeper
know
that
this
political
inefficiency
is
but
the
external
manifestation
or
the
latent
cause
of
more
serious
defects
by
impeding
healthful
development
in
one
way
it
occasions
a
morbid
development
in
another
if
citizenship
in
its
most
free
and
active
privilege
were
enjoyed
there
would
be
less
devotion
to
amusement
a
more
virile
national
character
and
the
sanctities
of
life
would
have
observance
public
spirit
and
a
political
career
are
incentives
to
manly
ambition
to
an
employment
of
mind
and
feeling
that
wins
men
from
trifling
pursuits
and
vain
diversion
they
are
the
national
basis
of
private
usefulness
to
thwart
them
is
to
condemn
humanity
to
perpetual
childhood
to
render
members
of
a
state
machines
the
social
evils
and
kinds
of
crime
in
france
are
referable
in
no
small
degree
to
the
absence
of
great
motives
the
limited
spheres
and
hopeless
routine
involved
in
arbitrary
government
unsustained
by
any
elevated
sentiment
such
a
rule
makes
literature
servile
enterprise
mercenary
and
manners
profligate
all
history
proves
this
it
is
not
therefore
rational
to
infer
from
the
apparent
want
of
ability
in
the
nation
to
take
care
of
its
own
affairs
that
a
military
despotism
is
justifiable
when
the
truth
is
equally
demonstrated
that
such
a
sway
by
indefinitely
postponing
the
chance
to
acquire
the
requisite
training
keeps
down
and
throws
back
the
national
impulse
and
destiny
the
man
who
thus
abuses
power
is
none
the
less
a
traitor
and
a
parricide
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
under
difficulties
and
what
came
of
it
mr
geer
geer
was
unquestionably
asleep
this
certainly
did
not
indicate
a
sufficiently
warm
appreciation
of
geer
social
charms
but
the
enormity
of
the
offence
will
be
greatly
modified
by
a
brief
review
of
the
attending
circumstances
if
you
will
but
consider
that
the
crackling
of
burning
wood
in
a
huge
franklin
stove
is
strongly
soporific
in
its
tendencies
that
the
cushion
of
a
capacious
constructed
and
adjusted
as
if
with
a
single
eye
to
a
delicious
dose
nay
to
a
long
succession
of
doses
is
a
powerful
temptation
to
a
sleepy
soul
that
the
regular
and
it
must
be
confessed
somewhat
monotonous
click
of
only
served
to
measure
without
disturbing
the
silence
and
lastly
that
they
had
been
husband
and
wife
for
thirty
years
you
will
not
cease
to
wonder
that
geer
was
glorious
all
the
ills
of
life
victorious
to
most
men
an
interruption
at
such
a
time
would
have
been
particularly
annoying
but
when
geer
spoke
in
that
way
geer
asleep
or
awake
always
made
a
point
of
hearing
so
he
roused
himself
and
turned
his
round
honest
face
and
placid
blue
eyes
on
the
partner
of
his
bosom
who
went
on
geer
our
ivy
will
be
seventeen
come
fall
possible
replied
geer
who
thunk
it
geer
as
you
may
infer
was
eminently
a
or
rather
a
in
respect
of
irregular
verbs
in
fact
he
tyrannized
over
all
parts
of
speech
wrested
nouns
and
verbs
from
their
original
shape
till
you
could
hardly
recognize
their
distorted
faces
and
committed
that
next
worst
sin
to
murdering
one
mother
namely
murdering
with
an
that
was
absolutely
fascinating
having
delivered
his
opinion
thus
sententiously
he
at
once
subsided
closed
his
placid
eyes
and
retired
into
his
inner
world
of
thought
perhaps
geer
this
time
he
fairly
jumped
from
his
seat
and
cast
about
him
scared
blinking
eyes
geer
how
can
you
sleep
away
your
precious
time
so
sleep
i
i
am
sure
i
was
never
wider
awake
in
my
life
well
then
tell
me
what
i
said
said
eh
eh
something
about
ivy
was
it
and
geer
nervously
twitched
up
the
skirts
of
his
coat
and
replaced
his
awry
cushion
and
began
to
think
that
perhaps
after
all
he
had
been
asleep
but
geer
was
too
much
interested
in
the
subject
of
her
own
cogitations
to
pursue
her
victory
farther
so
she
answered
yes
and
what
is
to
become
of
her
lud
lud
what
the
matter
asked
geer
wildly
matter
why
she
be
seventeen
come
fall
and
does
know
a
thing
o
lud
that
all
that
nothin
and
geer
settled
comfortably
down
into
his
once
more
he
felt
decidedly
relieved
visions
of
smallpox
cholera
and
the
worst
evils
that
he
could
think
of
and
dread
for
his
darling
had
been
conjured
up
by
his
wife
words
and
when
he
found
the
real
state
of
the
case
a
great
burden
which
had
suddenly
fallen
on
his
heart
was
as
suddenly
lifted
but
i
tell
you
it
something
continued
geer
energetically
ivy
is
a
woman
and
has
never
been
ten
miles
from
home
in
her
life
and
to
no
school
but
our
little
district
and
she
as
pairk
a
gal
interrupted
geer
as
any
you
find
in
all
the
ten
miles
round
be
the
other
who
she
will
she
well
enough
in
her
way
replied
geer
in
all
the
humility
of
motherly
pride
and
so
much
the
more
reason
why
she
should
be
let
go
so
there
dingham
sending
his
great
logy
girls
to
miss
seminary
i
wonder
if
he
expects
they
ever
turn
out
anything
and
here
our
ivy
bright
as
a
button
and
you
full
well
able
to
maintain
her
like
a
lady
and
have
done
nothing
but
turn
her
out
to
grass
all
her
life
till
she
fairly
run
wild
i
declare
it
a
shame
she
ought
to
be
sent
to
school
nonsense
sally
nonsense
i
lo
have
no
such
doin
go
off
to
school
what
the
use
havin
her
if
she
ca
stay
at
home
with
us
let
dingham
send
his
gals
to
chiny
if
he
wants
to
all
the
in
the
world
wo
make
equal
to
our
ivy
with
only
her
own
head
i
do
want
her
to
go
to
gettin
up
notions
she
all
gold
now
she
do
need
no
improvin
budge
an
inch
stir
a
step
but
do
consider
geer
the
child
has
got
to
leave
us
some
time
we
ca
have
her
always
why
ca
we
exclaimed
geer
almost
fiercely
sure
enough
why
ca
we
there
nobody
besides
you
and
me
i
suppose
that
thinks
she
pairk
what
john
herricks
and
dan
norris
hangin
round
for
all
the
time
and
they
may
hang
round
till
the
cows
come
home
nary
hair
of
head
shall
they
touch
nary
one
on
em
just
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
the
damsel
in
question
bounded
into
the
room
come
here
ivy
said
the
old
man
your
mother
been
you
says
you
do
know
nothin
ivy
knelt
before
him
rested
her
arms
on
his
knees
and
turned
upon
him
a
pair
of
palpably
roguish
eyes
father
it
an
awful
slander
i
do
know
a
sight
lud
child
yes
i
knew
you
did
no
more
you
do
want
to
marry
john
herricks
do
you
oh
daddy
geer
o
h
h
nor
dan
norris
nor
none
of
never
a
one
father
nor
do
you
ever
think
of
gettin
married
and
slavin
yourself
out
for
nobody
i
plenty
well
able
to
take
care
of
you
as
long
as
i
live
you
never
live
so
happy
as
you
do
at
home
and
you
break
my
heart
to
go
away
ivy
i
never
go
papa
she
pronounced
it
with
the
accent
on
the
first
syllable
indeed
i
never
will
i
never
be
married
as
long
as
i
live
no
more
you
good
child
good
child
and
again
farmer
geer
betook
himself
to
the
depths
of
his
with
the
complacent
consciousness
of
having
faithfully
discharged
his
parental
duties
she
should
not
go
to
school
she
would
not
be
married
she
had
said
she
would
not
and
of
course
she
would
not
of
course
i
shall
not
mused
ivy
as
she
lay
in
her
white
bed
what
could
put
it
into
poor
papa
head
marry
john
herricks
with
his
everlasting
smirk
and
his
diddling
walk
and
take
care
of
all
the
herricks
sisters
and
mothers
and
aunts
and
the
herricks
cows
and
horses
and
pigs
and
hens
and
and
but
ivy
had
kept
her
thoughts
on
her
marriage
longer
than
ever
before
in
her
life
and
ere
she
had
finished
the
inventory
of
john
personal
property
and
real
estate
the
blue
eyes
were
closed
in
the
sweet
sound
sleep
of
youth
and
health
geer
in
her
estimate
of
her
daughter
attainments
was
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
ivy
had
never
been
finished
at
seminary
and
was
consequently
in
a
highly
unfinished
condition
small
latin
and
less
greek
jostled
each
other
in
her
head
german
and
french
italian
and
spanish
were
strange
tongues
to
ivy
she
could
not
dance
nor
play
nor
draw
nor
paint
nor
work
little
dogs
on
footstools
what
then
could
she
do
she
could
climb
a
tree
like
a
squirrel
she
could
walk
across
the
great
beam
in
the
barn
like
a
kitten
in
the
pursuit
of
hens
eggs
she
knew
no
obstacles
from
scaffold
to
scaffold
from
haymow
to
haymow
she
leaped
defiant
she
pulled
out
the
hay
from
under
the
very
noses
of
the
astonished
cows
to
see
if
perchance
some
inexperienced
pullet
might
there
have
deposited
her
golden
treasure
with
all
beasts
she
was
on
the
best
of
terms
the
matronly
and
lazy
old
sheep
she
unceremoniously
hustled
aside
to
administer
consolation
and
caresses
to
the
timid
quaking
lamb
in
the
corner
behind
without
saddle
or
bridle
she
could
ride
a
black
horse
to
banbury
cross
i
do
say
she
actually
did
i
only
say
she
could
and
under
sufficiently
strong
provocation
i
have
no
doubt
she
would
she
knew
where
the
purple
violets
and
the
white
innocence
first
flecked
the
spring
turf
and
where
the
hid
their
mottled
eggs
all
the
little
waddling
downy
goslings
the
feeble
chickens
and
desponding
turkeys
that
broke
the
shell
too
soon
and
shivered
miserably
because
the
spring
sun
was
not
high
enough
in
the
morning
to
warm
them
she
fed
with
pap
and
cherished
in
and
nursed
and
watched
with
eager
happy
eyes
o
blessed
ivy
geer
true
sister
of
charity
thrice
blessed
stepmother
of
a
brood
whose
name
was
legion
from
the
conjugal
and
filial
conversation
which
i
have
faithfully
reported
a
casual
observer
particularly
if
young
and
inexperienced
might
infer
that
the
question
of
miss
ivy
education
was
definitively
settled
and
that
she
was
henceforth
to
remain
under
the
paternal
roof
i
should
myself
have
fallen
into
the
same
error
had
not
a
long
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
female
sex
generated
and
cherished
a
profound
and
mournful
conviction
of
the
truth
of
the
maxim
that
appearances
are
deceitful
a
woman
has
set
her
heart
on
something
and
is
refused
she
pouts
and
sulks
that
is
clouds
and
will
soon
blow
over
she
scolds
storms
and
raves
i
speak
in
a
figure
i
mean
she
does
something
as
much
like
that
as
a
tender
delicate
angelic
woman
can
that
is
thunder
and
only
clears
the
air
she
betakes
herself
to
tears
sobs
and
embroidered
cambric
that
a
shower
and
everything
will
be
greener
and
fresher
after
it
you
may
go
your
ways
one
to
his
farm
another
to
his
merchandise
the
world
will
not
wind
up
its
affairs
just
yet
but
put
the
case
she
goes
on
the
even
tenor
of
her
way
unmoved
beware
beware
trust
her
not
she
is
fooling
thee
thus
geer
who
was
a
thorough
tactician
like
napoleon
she
was
never
more
elated
than
after
a
defeat
before
consulting
her
husband
at
all
she
had
contemplated
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
and
had
deliberately
decided
that
ivy
was
to
go
to
school
the
consent
of
the
senior
partner
of
the
firm
was
a
secondary
matter
which
time
and
judicious
management
would
infallibly
secure
consequently
notwithstanding
the
unpropitious
result
of
their
first
colloquy
she
the
next
day
commenced
preparations
for
ivy
departure
as
unhesitatingly
as
calmly
as
assiduously
as
if
the
day
of
that
departure
had
been
fixed
geer
was
right
she
knew
she
was
all
the
time
she
had
a
sublime
faith
in
herself
she
felt
in
her
soul
the
divine
afflatus
and
pressed
forward
gloriously
to
her
goal
geer
had
as
much
firmness
not
to
say
obstinacy
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
most
men
but
geer
had
more
and
as
launce
outram
hard
beset
so
pathetically
moaned
a
woman
in
the
very
house
has
such
deused
opportunities
so
farmer
geer
grumbled
and
squirmed
and
remonstrated
and
yielded
geer
was
right
she
had
reckoned
without
her
host
her
affairs
were
gliding
down
the
very
appian
way
of
prosperity
in
a
with
footmen
and
outriders
when
presto
they
turned
a
sharp
and
unexpected
corner
and
over
went
the
whole
establishment
into
a
mirier
mire
than
ever
bespattered
slop
to
speak
without
a
parable
when
her
expected
hegira
was
announced
to
miss
mary
ives
geer
that
young
lady
to
the
vexation
of
her
mother
and
the
exultation
of
her
father
expressed
decided
disapprobation
of
the
whole
scheme
as
she
was
the
chief
the
very
hamlet
of
the
play
this
decision
somewhat
interfered
with
geer
plans
all
the
eloquence
of
that
estimable
woman
was
brought
to
bear
on
this
one
point
but
this
one
point
was
invincible
expostulation
and
entreaty
were
alike
vain
neither
ambition
nor
pleasure
could
hold
out
any
allurements
to
ivy
maternal
authority
was
at
length
hinted
at
only
hinted
at
and
the
spoiled
child
declared
that
she
had
not
had
her
own
will
and
way
for
sixteen
years
to
give
up
quietly
in
her
seventeenth
one
last
resort
one
forlorn
hope
one
expedient
which
had
never
failed
to
overcome
her
childish
stubbornness
would
she
grieve
her
parents
so
much
as
to
oppose
this
their
darling
wish
and
ivy
burst
into
tears
and
begged
to
know
if
she
should
show
her
love
to
her
father
and
mother
by
going
away
from
them
this
drove
the
nail
into
her
old
father
heart
and
then
the
little
vixen
clenched
it
by
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
and
sobbing
oh
papa
would
you
turn
your
ivy
out
of
doors
and
break
her
heart
flimsiest
of
fallacies
shallowest
of
sophists
but
she
was
the
only
and
beloved
child
of
his
old
age
so
the
fallacy
passed
unchallenged
the
strong
arms
closed
around
the
naughty
girl
and
the
soothing
voice
murmured
there
there
ivy
do
cry
child
lud
lud
you
be
bothered
no
more
you
lovey
and
the
was
restored
it
is
not
in
the
sea
nor
in
the
strife
we
feel
benumbed
and
wish
to
be
no
more
but
in
the
after
silence
on
the
shore
when
all
is
lost
except
a
little
life
said
one
who
had
breasted
the
stormiest
sea
and
plunged
into
the
fiercest
strife
ivy
who
had
never
read
byron
and
therefore
could
not
be
suspected
of
any
byronical
affectations
felt
it
when
having
gained
her
point
she
sat
down
alone
in
her
own
room
when
her
single
self
had
been
pitted
against
superior
numbers
age
experience
and
parental
authority
all
her
heroism
was
roused
and
she
was
adequate
to
the
emergency
but
her
end
gained
the
excitement
gone
the
sense
of
disobedience
alone
remaining
and
she
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
nay
miserable
mamma
is
right
i
know
i
am
a
little
goose
sobbed
she
the
words
were
mental
intangible
unspoken
the
sobs
physical
palpable
decided
i
never
did
know
anything
and
i
never
shall
and
i
care
if
i
do
i
do
see
any
good
in
knowing
so
much
we
do
have
a
great
while
to
stay
in
the
world
any
way
and
i
do
see
why
we
be
let
alone
and
have
a
good
time
while
we
are
here
and
when
we
get
to
heaven
we
can
take
a
fresh
start
oh
dear
i
never
shall
go
to
heaven
if
i
am
so
bad
and
vex
mamma
but
then
papa
did
care
but
then
he
would
have
liked
me
to
go
to
school
but
there
i
wo
i
wo
i
not
i
study
at
home
oh
dear
i
wish
papa
was
a
great
man
and
knew
everything
and
could
teach
me
well
he
is
just
as
happy
and
just
as
rich
and
everybody
likes
him
just
as
well
as
if
he
knew
the
whole
world
full
and
why
ca
i
do
so
too
rebecca
dingham
indeed
mercy
i
hope
i
never
shall
be
like
her
i
would
rather
not
know
my
a
b
c
what
i
do
there
brownslow
might
teach
me
he
knows
enough
but
dear
me
he
is
as
busy
as
he
can
be
all
day
long
and
squire
merrill
goes
out
of
town
every
day
and
there
dr
mix
to
be
sure
but
he
smells
so
strong
of
paregoric
and
i
do
believe
he
knows
much
either
and
there
nobody
else
in
town
that
knows
any
more
than
anybody
else
and
there
nothing
for
it
but
i
must
go
to
school
if
i
am
ever
to
know
anything
a
renewal
of
sobs
uninterrupted
for
several
minutes
there
mr
clerron
a
sudden
cessation
i
suppose
he
knows
more
than
the
whole
town
tumbled
into
one
and
writes
books
and
mercy
there
no
end
to
his
knowledge
and
he
rich
and
does
everything
he
likes
all
day
long
oh
if
i
only
know
him
i
would
ask
him
straight
off
to
teach
me
i
should
be
scared
to
death
i
a
great
mind
to
ask
him
as
it
is
i
can
tell
him
who
i
am
he
never
will
know
any
other
way
for
he
is
acquainted
with
anybody
they
say
he
is
as
proud
as
lucifer
if
he
were
ten
times
prouder
i
would
rather
ask
him
than
go
to
school
he
might
just
as
well
do
something
as
not
i
am
sure
if
god
had
made
me
him
and
him
me
i
should
be
glad
to
help
him
i
go
straight
to
him
the
first
thing
morning
once
seeing
a
possible
way
out
of
her
difficulties
her
sorrow
vanished
not
quite
so
gayly
as
usual
it
is
true
did
she
sing
about
the
house
that
night
for
she
was
summoning
all
her
powers
to
prepare
an
introductory
speech
to
felix
clerron
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
her
elocutionary
attempts
were
not
quite
satisfactory
to
herself
but
she
was
not
to
be
daunted
and
when
morning
came
she
took
heart
of
grace
slung
her
broadbrimmed
hat
over
her
arm
and
began
her
march
over
the
hills
and
far
away
in
search
of
her
fate
and
did
her
mother
really
let
her
roam
away
alone
on
such
an
errand
to
a
perfect
stranger
humanly
speaking
nothing
was
more
unlikely
than
that
geer
a
prudent
modest
and
sensible
woman
should
give
her
consent
to
such
an
to
use
the
mildest
term
unusual
undertaking
nor
did
she
the
fact
is
her
consent
was
not
asked
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
plan
worse
and
worse
did
the
wilful
girl
go
off
without
leave
without
even
informing
her
parents
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
did
in
writing
a
story
of
real
life
one
can
not
take
that
liberty
with
facts
which
is
quite
proper
not
to
say
indispensable
in
history
science
and
generally
duty
compels
me
to
adhere
closely
to
the
truth
and
for
whatever
of
obloquy
may
be
heaped
upon
me
or
upon
my
ivy
i
shall
find
consolation
in
the
words
of
the
illustrious
harrison
or
perhaps
it
was
the
illustrious
taylor
i
am
not
quite
sure
however
that
it
was
not
the
illustrious
washington
do
right
and
let
the
consequences
take
care
of
themselves
i
am
therefore
obliged
to
say
that
ivy
departure
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
was
entirely
unknown
to
her
respected
and
beloved
parents
but
you
must
remember
that
she
was
an
only
child
and
a
spoiled
child
spoiled
as
only
stern
new
england
puritan
parents
somewhat
advanced
in
years
can
spoil
their
children
i
do
not
defend
ivy
on
the
contrary
notwithstanding
my
regard
for
her
i
hand
her
over
to
the
reprobation
of
an
enlightened
community
and
i
hereby
entreat
all
young
persons
into
whose
hands
this
memoir
may
fall
to
take
warning
by
the
fate
of
poor
ivy
and
never
enter
upon
any
important
undertaking
until
they
have
to
say
the
least
consulted
those
who
are
their
natural
guides
their
warmest
friends
and
their
most
experienced
counsellors
while
i
have
been
writing
this
ivy
geer
light
of
heart
fleet
of
foot
and
firm
of
will
has
passed
over
through
and
across
and
drawn
near
the
domains
of
felix
clerron
esq
light
of
heart
perhaps
i
scarcely
ought
to
say
certainly
that
enterprising
organ
had
never
before
beat
so
furious
a
tattoo
in
breast
as
when
she
stood
hat
in
hand
on
the
steps
of
the
somewhat
stately
dwelling
to
do
her
justice
she
had
intended
to
do
the
penance
of
wearing
her
hat
when
she
should
have
reached
her
destination
but
in
her
excitement
she
quite
forgot
it
so
as
i
said
she
stood
on
the
as
a
royal
maiden
stood
three
hundred
years
before
not
in
the
same
place
with
the
wind
blowing
her
fair
hair
about
her
beautiful
cheeks
there
had
come
to
ivy
from
the
great
gay
world
a
vague
rumor
that
instead
of
knocking
at
a
door
like
a
christian
with
your
own
good
knuckles
for
such
case
made
and
provided
modern
fashion
had
introduced
the
ringing
and
the
dinging
of
the
bells
this
vague
rumor
found
a
local
habitation
when
clerron
came
down
upon
the
village
and
established
himself
his
men
and
women
and
horses
and
cattle
but
as
ivy
stood
on
his
looking
upward
downward
sidewise
with
earnest
peering
gaze
no
bell
and
no
sign
of
bell
was
visible
nothing
unusual
save
a
little
at
the
side
of
the
door
a
thing
which
could
not
be
accounted
for
after
long
and
serious
deliberation
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bell
must
be
inside
and
that
the
knob
was
a
screw
attached
to
it
so
she
tried
to
twist
it
first
one
way
then
the
other
but
twist
it
would
not
in
despair
she
betook
herself
to
her
fingers
and
knocked
nobody
came
twist
again
no
use
knock
again
ditto
then
she
went
down
to
the
gravelled
path
selected
one
of
the
largest
pebbles
took
up
her
station
before
the
door
and
began
to
pound
away
in
a
moment
a
gentleman
in
and
with
a
cigar
between
his
fingers
came
round
the
corner
seeing
her
he
threw
away
his
cigar
lifted
his
velvet
cap
bowed
and
with
a
polite
allow
me
stepped
to
the
door
pulled
the
bell
and
again
passed
out
of
sight
ivy
was
not
so
confused
at
being
detected
in
her
assault
and
battery
on
the
door
of
a
respectable
peaceable
private
gentleman
as
not
to
make
the
silent
reflection
pulled
the
knob
instead
of
twisting
it
how
easy
it
is
to
do
a
thing
if
you
only
know
how
the
summons
was
soon
answered
by
a
black
gnome
and
ivy
was
ushered
into
a
large
room
which
to
her
dazzled
eyes
seemed
delightfully
fresh
and
two
minutes
more
of
waiting
then
a
step
in
the
hall
a
gently
opening
door
and
ivy
felt
rather
than
saw
herself
in
the
presence
of
the
formidable
clerron
a
single
glance
showed
her
that
he
was
the
person
who
had
rung
the
bell
for
her
though
the
gay
had
been
changed
for
a
soberer
suit
clerron
bowed
ivy
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
faltered
forth
i
am
ivy
geer
a
smile
glimmered
behind
the
heavy
beard
and
gleamed
beneath
the
heavy
eyebrows
as
he
answered
i
am
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
but
another
glance
at
the
trembling
form
the
frightened
pale
face
and
quivering
lips
changed
the
smile
into
one
that
was
very
and
even
kind
and
he
added
playfully
i
am
felix
clerron
very
much
at
your
service
you
write
books
and
are
a
very
learned
man
pursued
ivy
hurriedly
never
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
floor
and
never
ceasing
to
twirl
her
there
was
no
possibility
of
supposing
her
guilty
of
committing
a
little
diplomatic
flattery
in
conveying
this
succinct
bit
of
information
she
made
the
assertion
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
a
disagreeable
piece
of
business
on
hand
and
is
determined
to
go
through
with
it
as
soon
as
possible
he
bowed
and
smiled
again
quite
unnecessarily
since
as
i
have
before
remarked
ivy
eyes
were
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
carpet
a
slight
pause
for
breath
and
she
pitched
ahead
again
i
am
very
ignorant
and
i
am
growing
old
i
am
almost
seventeen
i
do
know
anything
to
speak
of
mamma
wishes
me
to
go
to
school
papa
did
not
but
now
he
does
i
wo
go
i
would
rather
be
stupid
all
my
life
long
than
leave
home
but
mamma
is
vexed
and
i
want
to
please
her
and
i
thought
brownslow
is
so
busy
and
you
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
and
know
so
much
i
thought
she
stopped
short
utterly
unable
to
proceed
wonderfully
different
did
this
affair
seem
from
the
one
she
had
planned
the
preceding
evening
my
dear
sir
madam
have
not
we
too
sometimes
found
it
an
easier
thing
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
in
our
own
by
the
ruddy
and
genial
firelight
than
in
broad
day
on
the
world
great
clerron
seeing
ivy
confusion
kindly
came
to
her
aid
and
you
thought
my
superfluous
time
and
wisdom
might
be
transferred
to
you
thus
making
a
more
equal
division
of
property
if
you
would
be
so
good
i
yes
sir
may
i
inquire
how
you
propose
to
effect
such
an
exchange
he
really
did
not
intend
to
be
anything
but
kind
but
the
whole
matter
presented
itself
to
him
in
a
very
ludicrous
light
and
in
endeavoring
to
preserve
proper
gravity
he
became
severe
ivy
to
the
world
still
had
a
secret
feeling
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
tears
that
would
not
be
repressed
glistened
in
her
downcast
eyes
gathered
on
the
long
lashes
dropped
silently
to
the
floor
he
saw
that
she
was
entirely
a
child
ignorant
artless
and
sincere
his
better
feelings
were
roused
and
he
exclaimed
with
real
earnestness
my
dear
young
lady
i
should
rejoice
to
serve
you
in
any
way
i
beg
you
to
believe
his
words
only
hastened
the
catastrophe
which
seems
to
be
always
impending
over
the
weaker
sex
ivy
sobbed
outright
a
perfect
tempest
felix
clerron
looked
on
with
a
bachelor
dismay
what
in
thunder
confound
the
girl
were
his
first
reflections
but
her
utter
abandonment
to
sorrow
melted
his
heart
again
not
a
very
susceptible
heart
either
but
men
especially
bachelors
are
so
the
word
is
found
in
cowper
he
sat
down
by
her
side
stroked
the
hair
from
her
burning
forehead
as
if
she
had
been
six
instead
of
sixteen
and
again
and
again
assured
her
of
his
willingness
to
assist
her
i
must
go
home
whispered
ivy
as
soon
as
she
could
command
or
rather
coax
her
voice
his
hospitality
was
shocked
indeed
you
must
not
till
we
have
at
least
had
a
consultation
tell
me
how
much
you
know
what
have
you
studied
oh
nothing
sir
i
am
very
stupid
ah
we
must
begin
with
the
alphabet
then
blocks
or
a
primer
ivy
smiled
through
her
tears
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
sir
you
do
know
your
letters
perhaps
you
can
even
count
and
spell
your
name
maybe
write
it
pray
enlighten
me
ivy
grew
calm
as
he
became
playful
i
can
cipher
pretty
well
i
have
been
through
greenleaf
large
house
or
meadow
and
the
exact
dimensions
if
you
please
sir
i
understood
you
to
say
you
had
traversed
greenleaf
large
you
did
not
designate
what
he
was
laughing
at
her
now
indeed
but
it
was
open
and
genial
and
she
joined
my
arithmetic
of
course
i
supposed
everybody
knew
that
everybody
calls
it
so
time
is
short
yes
we
are
an
abbreviating
nation
do
you
like
arithmetic
pretty
well
some
parts
of
it
fractions
and
partial
payments
but
i
ca
bear
duodecimals
position
and
such
things
positions
are
occasionally
embarrassing
and
grammar
i
think
it
horrid
it

good
my

excellent
an

saved
you
and
your
friends
from

a
pitfall
shall
we
proceed
to
history
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
who
discovered
america
i
believe
columbus
has
the
credit
of
it
replied
ivy
demurely
i
see
case
goes
strongly
in
his
favor
but
you
reserve
your
judgment
till
further
evidence
i
think
he
was
a
wise
and
good
and
enterprising
man
but
are
rather
skeptical
about
that
san
salvador
story
a
wise
course
never
decide
till
both
sides
have
been
fairly
presented
that
judgeth
a
matter
before
he
heareth
it
it
is
folly
and
shame
unto
him
said
the
wise
man
occasionally
his
is
equally
discreditable
that
is
a
thousand
times
worse

geographia
my
young
friend
what
celebrated
city
has
the
honor
of
concentrating
the
laws
learning
and
literature
of
massachusetts
to
wit
namely
is
its
capital
boston
sir
my
dear
your
geography
has
evidently
been
attended
to
you
have
learned
the
basis
fact
you
have
discovered
the
pivot
on
which
the
world
turns
you
have
dug
down
to
the
granite
the
primitive
unfused
stratum
of
society
the
force
of
learning
can
no
farther
go
armed
with
that
fact
you
may
march
fearlessly
forth
to
do
battle
with
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
ahem
the
king
of
beasts
do
you
think
you
should
like
me
for
a
teacher
i
ca
tell
sir
i
did
not
like
you
as
anything
awhile
ago
but
you
like
me
better
now
you
think
i
improve
on
acquaintance
you
detect
signs
of
a
moral
reformation
no
sir
i
do
like
you
now
i
only
do
dislike
you
so
much
as
i
did
spoken
like
a
or
better
still
like
a
brave
little
yankee
girl
as
you
are
i
am
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
truth
i
foresee
we
shall
get
on
famously
i
was
rather
premature
in
sounding
the
state
of
your
affections
it
must
be
confessed
but
we
shall
be
rare
friends
on
the
whole
you
are
not
particularly
fond
of
books
i
like
some
books
well
enough
but
not
said
ivy
with
a
sigh
and
i
do
see
any
good
in
them
if
it
was
for
mamma
i
never
would
open
one
never
i
would
just
as
soon
be
a
dunce
as
not
i
do
see
anything
very
horrid
in
it
an
opinion
which
obtains
with
a
wonderfully
large
proportion
of
our
population
and
is
applied
in
practice
with
surprising
success
there
is
a
distinction
however
my
dear
young
lady
which
you
must
immediately
learn
to
make
the
dunce
subjective
is
a
very
inoffensive
animal
contented
happy
and
harmless
and
as
you
justly
remark
inspires
no
horror
but
rather
an
amiable
and
genial
the
dunce
objective
on
the
contrary
is
of
an
entirely
different
species
he
is
a
bore
of
the
first
magnitude
a
poisoned
arrow
that
not
only
pierces
but
inflames
a
dull
knife
that
not
only
cuts
but
tears
a
cowardly
little
cur
that
snaps
occasionally
but
snarls
unceasingly
whom
which
and
that
it
becomes
the
duty
of
all
good
citizens
to
sweep
from
the
face
of
the
earth
what
is
the
difference
between
them
how
shall
one
know
which
is
which
the
dunce
subjective
is
the
dunce
from
his
own
point
of
view
the
dunce
with
his
eyes
turned
inward
confining
his
duncehood
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
the
dunce
objective
is
the
dunce
butting
against
his
neighbor
intruding
obtruding
protruding
his
insipid
folly
and
still
more
insipid
wisdom
at
all
times
and
seasons
he
is
a
creature
utterly
devoid
of
shame
he
is
like
milton
angels
in
one
respect
at
least
you
may
thrust
him
through
and
through
with
the
sword
of
your
satire
and
at
the
end
he
shall
be
as
intact
and
integral
as
at
the
beginning
am
i
sufficiently
obvious
it
is
very
obvious
that
i
am
both
according
to
your
definition
it
is
very
obvious
that
you
are
neither
i
beg
to
submit
but
a
sensible
young
girl
with
no
great
quantity
of
the
manufactured
article
perhaps
but
plenty
of
raw
material
capable
of
being
wrought
into
fabric
of
the
finest
quality
do
you
really
think
i
can
learn
asked
ivy
with
a
bright
blush
of
pleasure
demonstrably
certain
as
much
as
if
i
went
to
school
my
dear
miss
as
the
forest
oak
cribbed
confined
with
multitudes
of
its
fellows
grows
stunted
scrubby
and
dwarfed
but
brought
into
the
open
fields
alone
stretches
out
its
arms
to
the
blue
heavens
and
its
roots
to
the
kindly
earth
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
lodge
in
the
branches
thereof
and
men
sit
under
its
shadow
with
great
delight
so
in
a
word
shall
you
under
my
fostering
care
flourish
like
a
green
that
is
if
i
am
to
have
the
honor
yes
sir
i
mean
i
meant
i
was
thinking
as
if
you
were
teaching
me
i
mean
were
going
to
teach
me
which
i
also
mean
if
time
and
the
favoring
gods
allow
and
your
parents
continue
to
wish
it
oh
they
wo
care
wo
care
no
sir
they
will
be
glad
i
think
papa
at
least
will
be
glad
to
have
me
stay
at
home
did
not
they
direct
you
to
come
to
me
ivy
blushed
deeply
and
replied
in
a
low
voice
no
sir
i
knew
mamma
would
not
let
me
come
if
i
asked
her
and
to
prevent
any
sudden
temptation
to
disobedience
and
a
consequent
forfeiture
of
your
peace
of
mind
you
took
time
by
the
forelock
and
came
on
your
own
responsibility
yes
sir
very
ingenious
upon
my
word
an
accomplished
casuist
a
born
jesuit
but
my
dear
miss
geer
i
must
confess
i
have
not
this
happy
feminine
knack
of
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
i
should
prefer
to
consult
your
friends
even
at
the
risk
of
losing
the
pleasure
of
your
society
oh
yes
sir
i
do
care
now
it
is
all
settled
and
so
over
along
and
through
with
light
heart
and
smiling
eyes
tripped
ivy
back
again
to
geer
shelling
peas
in
the
shady
porch
and
to
geer
fanning
himself
with
his
straw
hat
on
the
steps
beside
her
ivy
recounted
the
story
of
her
adventures
geer
was
thunderstruck
at
ivy
temerity
geer
was
lost
in
admiration
of
her
pluck
geer
termed
it
a
chase
geer
declared
ivy
to
be
as
smart
as
a
steel
trap
geer
vetoed
the
whole
plan
geer
did
know
but
when
at
sunset
clerron
rode
over
and
admired
geer
orchard
and
praised
the
points
of
his
durhams
and
begged
a
root
of
geer
scarlet
verbena
and
assured
them
he
should
be
very
glad
to
refresh
his
own
early
studies
and
also
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
the
family
he
knew
very
few
in
the
village
and
if
geer
would
drive
over
when
ivy
came
to
recite
or
perhaps
they
would
rather
he
should
come
to
their
house
oh
no
geer
could
not
think
of
that
just
as
they
pleased
simm
the
housekeeper
would
be
very
glad
of
geer
company
while
miss
ivy
was
reciting
in
case
geer
should
not
wish
to
listen
and
the
house
and
grounds
would
be
shown
by
simm
with
great
pleasure
by
the
way
simm
was
a
thrifty
and
sensible
woman
and
he
was
sure
they
would
be
mutually
when
in
short
all
this
and
much
more
had
been
said
it
was
decided
that
ivy
should
be
regularly
installed
pupil
of
felix
clerron
cries
the
professional
that
and
hound
that
snuffs
a
afar
off
and
anon
there
rises
before
his
eyes
the
vision
of
poor
little
stella
drinking
in
love
and
learning
especially
love
from
the
divine
eyes
of
the
anything
but
divine
swift
of
shirley
the
lioness
the
pantheress
the
leopardess
the
beautiful
fierce
creature
sitting
tamed
quiet
meek
by
the
side
of
louis
moore
her
tutor
and
master
and
of
all
the
legends
of
all
the
ages
wherein
beauty
has
sat
at
the
feet
of
wisdom
and
love
has
crept
in
unawares
and
spoiled
the
lesson
while
as
yet
so
he
cries
she
is
going
the
way
of
all
heroines
the
man
and
the
girl
they
will
fall
in
love
marry
and
live
happily
all
the
rest
of
their
days
of
course
they
will
is
there
any
reason
why
they
should
not
if
any
man
can
show
just
cause
why
they
may
not
lawfully
be
joined
together
let
him
now
speak
or
else
hereafter
forever
hold
his
peace
i
repeat
it
of
course
they
will
you
surely
can
not
suppose
i
should
in
cold
blood
sit
down
to
write
a
story
in
which
nobody
was
to
fall
in
love
or
be
in
love
sir
scoff
as
you
may
love
is
the
one
vital
principle
in
all
romance
not
only
does
your
cheek
flush
and
your
eye
sparkle
till
heart
brain
and
soul
are
all
on
fire
over
the
burning
words
of
some
brontean
pythoness
but
when
you
open
the
last
thrilling
work
of
maggie
marigold
and
are
immediately
submerged
in
a
weak
washy
everlasting
flood
of
insipidity
twaddle
bosh
and
sorrow
you
do
not
shut
the
book
with
a
jerk
why
not
because
in
the
dismal
distance
you
dimly
descry
two
figures
swimming
floating
struggling
towards
each
other
and
a
languid
of
curiosity
detains
you
till
you
have
ascertained
that
after
infinite
distress
adolphus
and
miranda
have
made
one
of
the
very
best
matches
both
well
mated
for
life
she
got
a
fool
for
her
husband
he
got
a
fool
for
his
wife
sir
scoff
as
you
may
love
is
the
one
sunbeam
of
poetry
that
gilds
with
a
softened
splendor
the
hard
bare
outline
of
many
a
prosaic
life
work
work
work
from
weary
chime
to
chime
tramp
behind
the
plough
hammer
on
the
lapstone
beat
the
anvil
drive
the
plane
from
morn
till
dewy
eve
but
when
the
dewy
eve
comes
ah
hesperus
gleams
soft
and
golden
over
the
pinetrees
but
the
star
that
lightens
your
bosom
most
and
gives
to
your
weary
feet
their
speed
abides
in
a
cottage
beyond
the
mead
it
is
useless
to
assert
that
the
subject
is
worn
threadbare
threadbare
it
may
be
to
you
enervated
and
man
of
pleasure
worn
and
hardened
man
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
for
you
i
write
the
fountain
which
leaps
up
fresh
and
living
in
every
new
life
can
never
be
exhausted
till
the
springs
of
all
life
are
dry
tell
me
o
lover
gazing
into
those
tender
eyes
uplifted
to
yours
twining
the
silken
rings
around
your
bronzed
finger
pressing
reverently
the
warm
lips
consecrated
to
you
does
it
abate
one
jot
or
tittle
of
your
happiness
to
know
that
eyes
just
as
tender
curls
just
as
silken
lips
just
as
red
have
stirred
the
hearts
of
men
for
a
thousand
years
love
then
is
a
qua
in
stories
and
if
love
why
not
marriage
what
pleasure
can
a
humane
and
benevolent
man
find
in
separating
two
individuals
whose
chief
perhaps
whose
sole
happiness
consists
in
being
together
for
certain
inscrutable
reasons
divine
benevolence
permits
evil
to
exist
in
the
world
all
who
have
a
taste
for
misery
can
find
it
there
in
exhaustless
quantities
johns
are
every
day
falling
in
love
with
katys
but
marrying
isabels
and
isabels
the
same
we
submit
to
it
because
there
is
no
alternative
and
we
believe
that
good
shall
finally
be
wrought
and
wrested
from
evil
do
for
heaven
sake
let
us
in
mere
wantonness
introduce
into
our
the
work
of
our
own
hand
an
abridged
edition
a
daguerreotype
copy
of
the
world
without
of
which
we
know
so
little
and
so
much
i
always
do
and
always
shall
read
the
last
page
of
a
novel
first
and
if
i
perceive
there
any
indications
that
matters
are
not
coming
out
shipshape
my
reading
invariably
terminates
with
the
last
page
for
the
rest
please
to
remember
that
i
am
not
writing
about
a
princess
of
the
blood
nor
of
the
days
of
the
bold
barons
but
only
the
life
of
a
quiet
little
girl
in
a
quiet
little
town
in
the
eastern
part
of
massachusetts
and
so
far
as
my
experience
and
observation
go
men
and
women
in
the
eastern
part
of
massachusetts
are
not
given
to
thrilling
adventures
hairbreadth
escapes
wonderful
concatenations
of
circumstances
and
blood
and
thunder
generally
but
pursue
the
even
tenor
of
their
way
and
of
their
love
with
a
sober
and
delightful
equanimity
if
you
want
a
plot
go
to
the
children
of
the
abbey
consuelo
and
myriads
of
that
kin
and
help
yourself
as
for
me
i
must
confess
i
hate
plots
i
see
no
pleasure
in
stumbling
blindfolded
through
a
story
unable
to
see
a
yard
ahead
fancying
every
turn
to
be
the
last
and
the
road
to
go
straight
on
to
a
glorious
goal
and
lo
we
are
in
a
more
hopeless
labyrinth
than
ever
i
have
a
sense
of
restraint
i
want
to
breathe
freely
and
ca
i
want
to
have
leisure
to
observe
the
style
the
development
of
character
the
author
tone
of
thought
and
not
be
galloped
through
on
the
back
of
a
breathless
desire
to
know
how
they
are
coming
out
but
my
dear
friend
be
easy
i
will
not
leave
you
in
the
lurch
i
am
not
going
to
marry
my
man
and
woman
out
of
hand
an
obstacle
of
which
i
suppose
you
have
never
heard
an
obstacle
entirely
new
fresh
and
unhackneyed
will
arise
so
i
pray
you
let
patience
have
her
perfect
work
wonderful
was
the
new
world
opened
to
ivy
geer
it
was
as
if
a
corpse
cold
inert
lifeless
had
suddenly
sprung
up
warm
invigorated
informed
with
a
spirit
which
led
her
own
grammar
grammar
which
had
been
a
synonyme
for
all
that
was
dry
irksome
useless
a
beating
of
the
wind
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
grammar
even
assumed
for
her
a
charm
a
wonder
a
glory
she
saw
how
the
great
and
wise
had
shrined
in
fitting
words
their
purity
and
wisdom
and
sorrow
and
suffering
and
penitence
and
how
as
this
generation
passed
away
and
another
came
forth
which
knew
not
god
the
golden
casket
became
dim
and
the
memory
of
its
priceless
gem
faded
away
but
how
at
the
touch
of
a
mighty
wand
the
obedient
lid
flew
back
and
the
thought
sprang
in
an
hour
she
saw
how
love
and
beauty
and
freedom
lay
floating
vaguely
and
aimlessly
in
a
million
minds
till
the
poet
came
and
crystallized
them
into
prismatic
words
tinged
for
each
with
the
color
of
his
own
fancy
and
wrought
into
a
perfect
mosaic
not
for
an
age
but
for
all
time
led
by
a
strong
hand
she
trod
with
reverent
awe
down
the
dim
aisles
of
the
past
and
saw
how
the
soul
of
man
bound
in
its
had
ever
struggled
to
voice
itself
in
words
roaming
in
the
dense
forest
with
the
stern
and
bloody
druid
bounding
over
the
waves
with
the
fierce
pirates
who
supplanted
them
and
in
whose
blue
eyes
and
beneath
whose
fair
locks
gleamed
indeed
the
ferocity
of
the
savage
but
lurked
also
though
unseen
and
unknown
the
tender
chivalry
of
the
english
gentleman
gazing
admiringly
on
the
barbaric
splendor
of
the
whereon
trod
regally
to
the
sound
of
harp
and
viol
the
beauty
and
bravery
of
the
old
norman
nobility
she
delighted
to
see
how
the
our
dear
had
laid
all
the
nations
under
contribution
to
enrich
her
treasury
gathering
from
one
its
strength
from
another
its
stateliness
from
a
third
its
harmony
till
the
harsh
crude
rugged
dialect
of
a
barbarous
horde
became
worthy
to
embody
as
it
does
the
love
the
wisdom
and
the
faith
of
half
a
world
so
grammar
taught
ivy
to
reverence
language
history
in
the
light
of
a
guiding
mind
ceased
to
be
a
bare
record
of
slaughter
and
crime
before
her
eyes
filed
in
a
statelier
pageant
than
they
knew
the
long
procession
of
simple
great
ones
gone
for
ever
and
ever
by
and
the
countless
lesser
ones
whose
names
are
quenched
in
the
darkness
of
a
night
that
shall
know
no
dawn
she
saw
the
great
world
spin
forever
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
but
amid
all
the
change
the
confusion
the
chaos
she
saw
the
finger
of
god
ever
pointing
and
heard
the
sublime
monotone
of
the
divine
voice
ever
saying
to
the
children
of
men
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
and
ivy
thought
she
saw
and
rejoiced
in
the
thought
that
even
when
this
warning
was
unheeded
when
on
the
brow
of
the
mournful
earth
ichabod
ichabod
was
forever
engraven
when
the
first
man
with
his
own
hand
put
from
him
the
cup
of
innocence
and
went
forth
from
the
happy
garden
and
fallen
the
whole
head
sick
and
the
whole
heart
faint
even
then
she
saw
within
him
the
divine
spark
the
leaven
of
life
which
had
power
to
vitalize
and
vivify
what
crime
had
smitten
with
death
though
sea
and
land
teemed
with
strange
perils
though
night
and
day
pursued
him
with
mysterious
terrors
though
the
now
unfriendly
elements
combined
to
check
his
career
still
with
unswerving
purpose
undaunted
courage
she
saw
him
march
constantly
forward
spirits
of
evil
could
not
drive
from
his
heart
the
prescience
of
greatness
and
his
soul
dwelt
calmly
under
the
foreshadow
of
a
mighty
future
and
as
ivy
looked
she
saw
how
the
children
of
men
became
a
great
nation
and
possessed
the
land
far
and
wide
they
delved
into
the
bosom
of
the
pleased
earth
and
brought
forth
the
treasures
of
uncounted
cycles
they
unfolded
the
book
of
the
skies
and
sought
to
read
the
records
thereon
they
plunged
into
the
unknown
and
terrible
ocean
and
decked
their
own
brows
with
the
gems
they
plucked
from
hers
and
when
conquered
nature
had
laid
her
hoards
at
their
feet
their
restless
longings
would
not
be
satisfied
brave
young
spirits
with
the
dew
of
their
youth
fresh
upon
them
set
out
in
quest
of
a
land
beyond
their
ken
over
the
mountains
across
the
seas
through
the
forests
there
came
to
the
ear
of
the
dreaming
girl
the
measured
tramp
of
marching
men
the
softer
footfalls
of
loving
women
the
pattering
of
the
feet
of
little
children
many
a
day
and
many
a
night
she
saw
them
wander
on
towards
the
setting
sun
till
the
unseen
hand
led
them
to
a
fair
and
fruitful
country
that
opened
its
bounteous
arms
in
welcome
broad
rivers
green
fields
laughing
valleys
wooed
them
to
plant
their
household
gods
and
the
foundations
of
europe
were
laid
here
were
sown
the
seeds
of
those
heroic
virtues
which
have
since
leaped
into
luxuriant
life
seeds
of
that
irresistible
power
which
fastened
its
grasp
on
nature
and
forced
her
to
unfold
the
secret
of
her
creation
seeds
of
that
wisdom
which
in
the
light
of
the
unveiled
past
has
read
the
story
of
the
unseen
future
and
still
under
ivy
eye
they
grouped
themselves
some
gathered
on
the
pleasant
hills
of
the
sunny
south
and
the
beauty
of
earth
and
sea
and
sky
passed
into
their
souls
forever
they
caught
the
evanescent
gleam
the
passing
shadow
and
on
unseemly
canvas
limned
it
for
all
time
in
forms
of
unuttered
and
unutterable
loveliness
they
shaped
into
glowing
life
the
phantoms
of
grace
that
were
always
flitting
before
their
enchanted
eyes
and
poured
into
inanimate
marble
their
rapt
and
passionate
souls
they
struck
the
lyre
to
wild
and
stirring
songs
whose
tremulous
echoes
still
linger
along
the
corridors
of
time
some
sought
the
icebound
north
and
grappled
with
dangers
by
field
and
flood
they
hunted
the
wild
dragon
to
his
and
fought
him
at
bay
and
never
quailed
death
in
its
most
fearful
forms
they
met
with
grim
delight
and
chanted
the
glories
of
the
valhalla
waiting
for
heroes
who
should
forever
quaff
the
foaming
pure
and
shining
mead
from
skulls
of
foes
in
battle
slain
some
crossed
the
sea
and
on
that
pale
that
shore
whose
foot
spurns
back
tho
ocean
swelling
tide
they
reared
a
sinewy
and
stalwart
race
whose
morning
encircles
the
world
and
history
taught
ivy
to
reverence
man
but
there
was
one
respect
in
which
ivy
was
both
pupil
and
teacher
never
a
word
of
botany
had
fallen
upon
her
ears
but
through
all
the
unconscious
bliss
of
infancy
childhood
and
girlhood
for
sixteen
happy
years
she
had
lived
among
the
flowers
and
she
knew
their
dear
faces
and
their
names
she
loved
them
with
an
almost
human
love
they
were
to
her
companions
and
friends
she
knew
their
likings
and
dislikings
their
joys
and
sorrows
who
among
them
chose
the
darkest
nooks
of
the
old
woods
and
who
bloomed
only
to
the
brightest
sunlight
who
sent
their
roots
deep
down
among
the
mosses
by
the
brook
and
who
smiled
only
on
the
southern
around
each
she
wove
a
web
of
beautiful
individuality
and
more
than
one
had
received
from
her
a
new
christening
it
is
true
that
when
she
came
to
study
from
a
book
she
made
wry
faces
over
the
long
barbarous
latin
names
which
completely
disguised
her
favorites
and
in
her
heart
deemed
a
great
many
of
the
definitions
quite
superfluous
but
she
had
strong
faith
in
her
teacher
and
when
the
technical
was
laid
aside
for
the
real
then
indeed
her
foot
was
on
her
native
heath
and
her
name
was
macgregor
a
wild
and
merry
chase
she
led
her
grave
instructor
morning
noon
or
night
she
was
always
ready
under
the
blue
sky
breathing
the
pure
air
treading
the
green
turf
familiar
from
her
infancy
she
could
not
be
otherwise
than
happy
but
when
was
superadded
to
this
the
companionship
of
a
mind
vigorous
cultivated
and
refined
she
enjoyed
it
with
a
keen
and
intense
delight
nowhere
else
did
her
soul
so
entirely
unfold
to
the
genial
light
of
this
new
sun
which
had
suddenly
mounted
above
her
horizon
nowhere
else
did
the
freshness
and
fulness
and
splendor
of
life
dilate
her
whole
being
with
a
fine
ecstasy
and
what
was
the
end
of
all
this
just
what
you
would
have
supposed
she
had
led
a
life
of
simple
unbounded
love
and
trust
a
buoyant
elastic
gladness
a
dream
of
sunshine
no
gray
cloud
had
ever
lowered
in
her
sky
no
thunderbolt
smitten
her
joys
no
winter
rain
chilled
her
warmth
only
the
white
fleeciness
of
morning
mist
had
flitted
sometimes
over
her
deepening
the
blue
little
cooling
drops
had
fluttered
down
through
the
leafiness
only
to
span
her
with
a
rainbow
in
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
but
the
time
had
come
from
the
deep
fountains
of
her
heart
the
stone
was
to
be
rolled
away
the
secret
chord
was
to
be
smitten
by
a
a
chord
which
once
stirred
may
never
cease
to
quiver
at
first
ivy
worshipped
very
far
off
her
friend
was
to
her
the
embodiment
of
all
knowledge
and
goodness
and
greatness
she
marvelled
to
see
him
so
at
home
in
what
was
to
her
so
strange
every
word
that
fell
from
his
lips
was
an
oracle
she
secretly
contrasted
him
with
all
the
men
she
had
ever
met
to
the
utter
discomfiture
of
the
latter
washington
the
apostle
paul
and
peter
parley
were
the
only
men
of
the
past
or
present
whom
she
considered
at
all
worthy
to
be
compared
with
him
and
in
fact
if
these
three
men
and
felix
clerron
had
all
stood
before
her
and
offered
each
a
different
opinion
on
any
given
subject
i
have
scarcely
a
doubt
as
to
whose
would
have
commended
itself
to
her
as
combining
the
soundest
practical
wisdom
and
the
highest
christian
benevolence
so
the
summer
passed
on
and
her
shyness
wore
off
and
their
intimacy
became
less
and
less
that
of
teacher
and
pupil
and
more
and
more
that
of
friend
and
friend
with
the
sudden
awakening
of
her
intellectual
nature
there
woke
also
another
power
of
whose
existence
she
had
never
dreamed
it
was
natural
that
in
ranging
the
fields
of
thought
so
lately
opened
to
her
she
should
often
revert
to
him
whose
hand
had
unbarred
the
gates
she
was
therefore
not
startled
that
the
image
of
felix
clerron
was
with
her
when
she
sat
down
and
when
she
rose
up
when
she
went
out
and
when
she
came
in
she
ceased
indeed
to
think
him
she
thought
she
lived
him
her
soul
fed
on
his
life
and
so
and
so
by
a
pleasant
and
flowery
path
there
came
into
ivy
heart
the
old
old
pain
now
the
thing
was
on
this
wise
one
morning
when
she
went
to
recite
she
did
not
find
clerron
in
the
library
where
he
usually
awaited
her
after
spending
a
few
moments
in
looking
over
her
lessons
she
rose
and
was
about
to
pass
to
the
door
to
ring
when
simm
looked
in
and
seeing
ivy
informed
her
that
clerron
was
in
the
garden
and
desired
her
to
come
out
ivy
immediately
followed
simm
into
the
garden
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
was
a
piazza
two
stories
high
along
the
pillars
which
supported
it
a
had
been
constructed
reaching
several
feet
above
the
roof
of
the
piazza
about
this
climbed
a
vigorous
which
not
only
completely
screened
nearly
the
whole
front
of
the
piazza
but
reaching
the
top
of
the
trellis
shot
across
by
the
aid
of
a
few
pieces
of
fine
wire
and
overran
a
part
of
the
roof
of
the
house
thus
the
roof
of
the
piazza
was
the
floor
of
a
beautiful
apartment
whose
walls
and
ceiling
were
broad
rustling
green
leaves
among
which
drooped
now
innumerable
heavy
clusters
of
rich
purple
grapes
from
behind
this
leafy
wall
a
voice
cried
hail
to
thee
my
twining
vine
ivy
turned
and
looked
up
with
the
uncertain
inquiring
smile
we
often
wear
when
conscious
that
though
unseeing
we
are
not
unseen
and
presently
two
hands
parted
the
leaves
far
enough
for
a
very
sunshiny
smile
to
gleam
down
on
the
upturned
face
oh
i
wish
i
could
come
up
there
cried
ivy
clasping
her
hands
with
childish
eagerness
the
wish
is
father
to
the
deed
may
i
be
sure
you
may
but
how
shall
i
get
in
are
you
afraid
to
come
up
the
ladder
no
i
do
mean
that
but
how
shall
i
get
in
where
you
are
after
i
am
up
oh
never
fear
i
draw
you
in
safely
enough
lorful
heart
miss
ivy
what
are
you
going
to
do
cried
simm
in
terror
ivy
was
already
on
the
third
round
of
the
ladder
but
she
stopped
and
answered
hesitatingly
he
said
i
might
he
said
you
might
yes
continued
simm
talking
ivy
but
clerron
with
whom
she
hardly
dared
to
remonstrate
in
a
more
direct
way
and
if
he
said
you
might
throw
yourself
down
vineyard
cliff
it
do
follow
that
you
are
bound
to
do
it
he
goes
into
all
sorts
of
scrapes
himself
but
you
ca
follow
him
but
it
looks
so
nice
up
there
pleaded
ivy
and
i
have
been
twice
as
high
at
home
i
do
mind
it
at
all
if
your
father
chooses
to
let
you
run
the
risk
of
your
life
it
none
of
my
but
i
going
to
have
you
breaking
your
neck
right
under
my
nose
if
you
want
to
get
up
there
i
show
you
the
way
in
the
house
and
you
can
step
right
out
of
the
window
just
wait
till
told
ellen
about
the
dinner
as
simm
disappeared
clerron
said
softly
to
ivy
come
and
in
a
moment
ivy
bounded
up
the
ladder
and
through
an
opening
in
the
vine
and
stood
by
his
side
i
ready
now
miss
ivy
said
simm
reappearing
miss
ivy
where
is
the
child
a
merry
laugh
greeted
her
oh
you
cried
the
old
housekeeper
you
never
die
in
your
bed
not
for
a
good
while
i
hope
answered
clerron
then
he
made
ivy
sit
down
by
him
and
took
from
the
great
basket
the
finest
cluster
of
grapes
is
that
reward
enough
for
coming
coming
into
so
beautiful
a
place
as
this
is
like
what
you
read
yesterday
about
poetry
to
coleridge
own
exceeding
great
reward
and
you
do
want
the
grapes
i
do
know
that
i
have
any
intrinsic
objection
to
them
as
a
free
gift
it
was
only
the
principle
that
i
opposed
very
well
we
will
go
shares
then
you
may
have
half
for
the
free
gift
and
i
will
have
half
for
the
principle
little
tendril
you
look
as
fresh
as
the
morning
do
i
always
i
should
say
there
was
a
more
dew
than
usual
stand
up
and
let
me
survey
you
if
perchance
i
may
discover
the
cause
ivy
rose
made
a
profound
curtsy
and
then
turned
slowly
around
after
the
manner
of
the
revolving
in
a
milliner
window
i
do
know
continued
clerron
when
ivy
after
a
couple
of
revolutions
resumed
her
seat
you
seem
to
be
the
same
i
think
it
must
be
the
frock
i
do
wear
a
frock
i
do
think
it
would
improve
my
style
of
beauty
if
i
did
papa
wears
one
sometimes
and
what
kind
of
a
frock
pray
does
wear
oh
a
horrid
blue
thing
comes
about
down
to
his
knees
made
of
some
kind
of
woollen
stuff
horrid
and
what
name
do
you
give
to
that
white
thing
with
blue
sprigs
in
it
this
yes
this
is
a
dress
no
this
and
your
collar
and
hat
and
shoes
and
sash
are
your
dress
this
is
a
frock
ivy
shook
her
head
doubtfully
you
know
a
great
deal
i
know
so
you
informed
me
once
before
oh
do
mention
that
said
ivy
blushing
and
quickly
added
do
you
know
i
have
discovered
the
reason
why
you
like
me
this
morning
and
every
morning
sir
go
on
what
is
the
reason
it
is
because
i
and
ironed
it
myself
with
my
hands
and
that
you
know
is
the
reason
it
looks
nicer
than
usual
ah
me
i
wish
i
wore
dresses
you
can
if
you
choose
i
suppose
there
is
no
one
to
hinder
you
simpleton
that
is
not
what
you
were
intended
to
say
you
should
have
asked
the
cause
of
so
singular
a
wish
and
then
i
had
a
pretty
little
speech
all
ready
for
you
a
veritable
compliment
it
is
well
i
did
not
ask
then
mamma
does
not
approve
of
compliments
and
perhaps
it
would
have
made
me
vain
incorrigible
why
did
you
not
ask
me
what
the
speech
was
and
thus
give
me
an
opportunity
to
relieve
myself
why
a
body
might
die
of
a
plethora
of
flattery
if
he
had
nobody
but
you
to
discharge
it
against
he
must
take
care
then
that
the
supply
does
not
exceed
the
demand
political
economy
upon
my
word
what
shall
we
have
next
domestic
i
suppose
you
would
like
men
generally
indeed
prefer
it
to
the
other
i
am
told
ah
ivy
ivy
little
you
know
about
men
my
child
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
was
silent
for
some
minutes
ivy
did
not
care
to
interrupt
his
thinking
presently
he
said
ivy
how
old
are
you
i
shall
be
seventeen
the
last
day
of
this
month
a
short
pause
and
then
eighteen
and
then
nineteen
and
then
twenty
in
three
years
you
will
be
twenty
horrid
old
is
it
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
down
upon
her
with
what
ivy
thought
a
curious
kind
of
smile
but
only
said
you
must
not
say
so
much
ivy
grew
rather
tired
of
sitting
silent
and
watching
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
which
hid
every
other
prospect
she
turned
her
face
a
little
so
that
she
could
look
at
him
he
sat
with
folded
arms
looking
straight
ahead
and
she
thought
his
face
wore
a
troubled
expression
she
felt
as
if
she
would
like
very
much
to
smooth
out
the
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
and
run
her
fingers
through
his
hair
as
she
sometimes
did
for
her
father
she
had
a
great
mind
to
ask
him
if
she
should
then
she
reflected
that
it
might
make
him
nervous
then
she
wondered
if
he
had
forgotten
her
lessons
and
how
long
they
were
to
sit
there
determined
at
length
to
have
a
change
of
some
kind
she
said
softly
mr
clerron
he
roused
himself
suddenly
and
stood
up
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
a
headache
no
ivy
but
this
is
not
climbing
the
hill
of
science
is
it
not
so
much
as
it
is
climbing
the
piazza
suppose
we
take
a
vacation
and
investigate
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
yes
sir
i
am
ready
ivy
did
not
fully
understand
the
nature
of
his
proposition
but
if
he
had
proposed
to
put
a
girdle
round
the
earth
in
forty
minutes
she
would
have
said
and
acted
yes
sir
i
am
ready
just
the
same
he
took
up
the
basket
of
grapes
which
he
had
gathered
and
led
the
way
through
the
window
ivy
waited
for
him
at
the
while
he
carried
the
grapes
to
simm
then
he
joined
her
again
and
proposed
to
walk
through
the
woods
a
little
while
before
ivy
went
home
you
must
know
my
docile
pupil
that
i
am
going
to
the
city
on
business
to
be
gone
a
week
or
two
so
as
you
must
perforce
take
a
vacation
then
why
we
may
as
well
begin
to
vacate
today
and
enjoy
it
i
am
sorry
you
are
going
away
you
are
that
is
almost
enough
to
pay
me
for
going
why
are
you
sorry
because
i
shall
not
see
you
for
a
week
and
i
have
become
so
used
to
you
that
somehow
i
do
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
a
day
without
you
and
then
the
cars
may
run
off
the
track
and
kill
you
or
hurt
you
or
you
may
get
the
smallpox
or
a
great
many
things
may
happen
and
suppose
some
of
these
terrible
things
should
happen
the
last
for
instance
what
would
you
do
i
i
should
advise
you
to
send
for
the
doctor
at
once
clerron
laughed
so
you
would
not
come
and
nurse
me
and
take
care
of
me
and
get
me
well
again
no
because
i
should
then
be
in
danger
of
taking
it
myself
and
giving
it
to
papa
and
mamma
besides
they
would
not
let
me
i
am
quite
sure
so
you
love
your
papa
and
mamma
better
than
he
stopped
abruptly
ivy
finished
for
him
better
than
words
can
tell
papa
particularly
mamma
somehow
seems
strong
of
herself
and
do
depend
upon
me
but
papa
oh
you
know
how
he
is
to
me
i
think
if
i
should
die
he
would
die
of
grief
i
have
i
can
not
help
having
a
kind
of
pity
for
him
he
loves
me
so
do
you
always
pity
people
when
they
love
you
very
much
oh
no
of
course
not
besides
nobody
loves
me
enough
to
be
pitied
except
is
it
pleasant
here
how
very
green
it
is
it
looks
just
like
summer
oh
clerron
did
you
see
the
clouds
this
morning
there
were
none
when
i
arose
why
yes
sir
there
was
a
great
heap
of
them
at
sunrise
i
am
not
prepared
to
contradict
you
perhaps
you
were
not
up
at
sunrise
i
have
an
impression
to
that
effect
he
smiled
so
comically
that
ivy
could
not
help
saying
though
she
was
half
afraid
he
might
not
be
pleased
i
wonder
whether
you
are
an
early
riser
yes
my
dear
i
consider
myself
tolerably
early
i
believe
i
have
been
up
every
morning
but
one
this
week
by
nine
ivy
was
her
country
ideas
of
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
received
a
great
shock
as
her
looks
plainly
showed
he
laughed
gayly
at
her
amazed
face
you
do
seem
to
appreciate
me
miss
geer
repeated
ivy
slowly
morning
but
one
and
it
is
tuesday
yes
but
you
know
yesterday
was
a
dark
cloudy
day
and
excellent
for
sleeping
but
clerron
then
you
are
not
more
than
fairly
up
when
i
come
and
when
do
you
write
always
in
the
evening
but
the
evenings
are
so
short
or
have
been
mine
are
not
particularly
so
from
six
to
three
is
about
long
enough
for
one
sitting
i
should
think
so
and
you
must
be
so
tired
not
so
tired
as
you
think
you
now
rising
at
five
or
six
and
running
round
all
day
become
so
tired
that
you
have
to
go
to
bed
by
nine
of
course
you
have
no
time
for
reflection
and
meditation
i
on
the
contrary
take
life
easily
write
in
the
night
when
everything
is
still
and
quiet
take
my
sleep
when
all
the
noise
of
the
is
going
on
and
after
creation
is
fairly
settled
for
the
day
i
rise
leisurely
breakfast
leisurely
take
a
smoke
leisurely
and
leisurely
wait
the
coming
of
my
little
pupil
mr
clerron
well
may
i
tell
you
another
thing
i
do
like
in
you
a
bad
habit
as
many
as
you
please
provided
you
wo
require
me
to
reform
what
is
the
use
of
telling
it
then
but
it
may
be
a
relief
to
you
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
arising
from
doing
your
duty
we
shall
ventilate
our
opinions
and
perhaps
come
to
a
better
understanding
go
on
well
sir
i
wish
you
did
not
smoke
so
much
i
do
smoke
very
much
little
ivy
i
wish
you
would
not
at
all
mamma
thinks
it
is
very
injurious
and
wrong
even
and
papa
says
cigars
are
bad
things
some
of
them
are
outrageous
but
my
dear
granting
your
father
and
mother
and
yourself
to
be
right
do
you
see
i
am
doing
more
to
extirpate
the
evil
than
you
with
all
your
principle
i
exterminate
destroy
and
ruin
them
at
the
rate
of
three
a
day
while
you
i
venture
to
say
never
lifted
a
finger
or
lighted
a
spark
against
them
now
sir
that
is
only
a
way
of
slipping
round
the
question
and
i
really
wish
you
did
not
before
i
knew
you
i
thought
it
was
almost
as
bad
to
smoke
as
it
was
to
steal
i
know
however
now
that
it
can
not
be
still
feminine
logic
i
have
not
studied
logic
yet
still
as
i
was
going
to
say
sir
i
do
like
to
think
of
you
as
being
in
a
kind
of
subjection
to
anything
ivy
seriously
i
am
not
in
subjection
to
a
cigar
i
often
do
smoke
for
months
together
to
prove
it
i
promise
you
i
wo
smoke
for
the
next
two
months
oh
i
am
so
glad
oh
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
and
you
are
not
in
the
least
vexed
that
i
spoke
to
you
about
it
not
in
the
least
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
and
one
thing
more
sir
i
have
been
afraid
of
the
last
few
days
you
know
when
i
first
knew
you
or
before
i
knew
you
i
supposed
you
did
nothing
but
walk
round
and
enjoy
yourself
all
day
but
now
i
know
you
do
work
very
hard
and
i
have
feared
that
you
could
not
well
spare
two
hours
every
day
for
me
particularly
in
the
morning
which
are
almost
always
considered
the
best
but
if
you
like
to
write
in
the
evening
you
would
just
as
soon
i
would
come
in
the
morning
certainly
but
if
two
hours
are
too
much
i
hope
you
wo
at
any
time
hesitate
to
tell
me
i
have
no
claim
on
a
moment
only
my
dear
ivy
geer
pupil
and
friend
be
so
good
as
to
understand
henceforth
that
you
can
not
possibly
come
into
my
house
at
any
time
when
you
are
not
wanted
nor
stay
any
longer
than
i
want
you
nor
say
anything
that
will
not
please
me
well
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
that
but
at
least
remember
that
i
am
always
glad
to
see
you
and
teach
you
and
have
you
with
me
and
that
i
can
never
hope
to
do
you
as
much
good
as
you
do
me
every
day
of
your
blessed
life
oh
mr
clerron
exclaimed
ivy
with
a
great
gush
of
gratitude
and
happiness
do
i
can
i
do
any
good
you
do
and
can
my
tendril
you
supply
an
element
that
was
wanting
in
my
life
you
make
every
day
beautiful
to
me
the
flutter
of
your
robes
among
these
trees
brings
sunshine
into
my
heart
every
morning
i
walk
in
my
garden
as
soon
as
i
am
as
you
say
fairly
up
till
i
see
you
turn
into
the
lane
and
every
day
i
watch
you
till
you
disappear
you
are
fresh
and
truthful
and
natural
and
you
give
me
new
life
and
now
my
dear
little
trembling
benefactor
because
we
are
nearly
through
the
woods
i
can
go
no
farther
with
you
and
because
i
am
going
away
not
to
see
you
again
for
a
week
and
because
i
hope
you
will
be
a
little
lonesome
while
i
am
gone
why
i
think
i
must
let
you
kiss
me
ivy
had
been
looking
intently
into
his
face
with
an
expression
at
first
of
the
most
beaming
tearful
delight
then
gradually
changing
into
waiting
wonder
but
when
his
sentence
finally
closed
she
stood
still
scarcely
able
to
comprehend
he
placed
his
hands
on
her
temples
and
smiling
involuntarily
at
her
blushes
and
embarrassment
half
in
sport
and
half
in
tenderness
bent
her
head
a
little
back
kissed
brow
cheeks
and
lips
whispered
softly
go
now
god
bless
you
for
ever
and
ever
my
darling
and
turning
walked
hastily
down
the
winding
path
as
for
ivy
she
went
home
in
a
dream
blind
and
stunned
with
a
great
joy
to
be
continued
implora
pace
no
more
their
perfume
to
this
dull
pain
brings
short
surcease
but
tell
me
if
ye
know
where
bloom
the
golden
of
peace
leap
winnowing
all
the
air
of
light
ye
wild
wraiths
of
the
waterfall
but
for
that
fabled
fountain
sight
that
giveth
sleep
i
give
you
all
bound
gay
barks
the
bounding
main
shake
all
your
white
wings
to
the
breeze
my
joy
was
erst
the
hurricane
the
plunging
of
the
purple
seas
my
hope
to
find
the
mystic
marge
of
all
strange
lands
the
strange
world
but
bear
me
now
to
yon
still
barge
calm
cradled
by
a
tideless
shore
wild
birds
that
cleave
the
crystal
deeps
with
matins
loud
and
long
oh
not
for
you
my
sick
heart
weeps
its
pulses
time
not
to
your
song
but
know
ye
where
she
hides
her
nest
beneath
what
balmy
dropping
eaves
the
dove
that
bears
on
her
white
breast
the
sacred
green
of
not
when
the
spring
doth
rosy
rise
from
white
foam
of
the
northern
snows
not
when
skies
the
june
in
beauty
glows
but
when
amid
the
templed
hills
deep
drained
from
every
purple
vine
soft
for
her
dying
lips
distils
the
summer
sacramental
wine
while
all
her
woodland
priests
put
on
their
vestures
dipped
in
sacrifice
and
as
golden
bells
far
swung
a
rhythmic
silence
holds
the
skies
what
time
the
softly
wells
from
night
dark
caverns
till
it
sets
in
long
melodious
tidal
swells
toward
the
wide
of
the
west
oh
open
then
my
dungeon
door
let
nature
lead
me
blind
of
eyes
if
haply
i
may
once
more
the
pillars
of
the
steadfast
skies
if
haply
there
may
fall
for
me
some
strange
assurance
in
my
fears
as
he
who
heard
on
galilee
that
stormy
night
in
wondrous
years
the
it
is
i
and
the
foam
of
what
seemed
seas
saw
glory
of
the
kingdom
come
the
footsteps
of
the
prince
of
peace
the
progress
of
the
electric
telegraph
their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth
and
their
words
to
the
end
of

among

here
we

at

every

can

the
lines
of

are
increasing
so
rapidly
that
the
length
in
actual
use
can
not
be
estimated
at
any
moment
with
accuracy
at
the
commencement
of
it
was
stated
that
the
length
in
operation
in
this
country
was
about
miles
at
the
end
of
the
lines
in
operation
or
in
progress
in
the
united
states
amounted
to
in
the
total
number
of
miles
of
wire
in
america
amounted
to
it
is
but
fifteen
years
since
the
first
line
of
electric
telegraph
was
constructed
in
this
country
and
at
the
present
time
there
are
not
less
than
miles
in
successful
operation
on
this
continent
having
over
stations
and
employing
upwards
of
operators
and
clerks
the
number
of
messages
passing
over
all
the
lines
in
this
country
annually
is
estimated
at
upwards
of
producing
a
revenue
of
in
addition
to
which
the
press
pays
for
public
despatches
in
europe
there
are
lines
rivalling
those
in
america
the
electric
wire
extends
under
the
english
channel
the
german
ocean
the
black

also
their
lines
and
the
wires
uniting
the
pacific
and
atlantic
states
will
shortly
meet
at
the
passes
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
electric
telegraph
which
has
made
such
rapid
strides
is
yet
in
its
infancy
the
effect
of
its
future
extension
and
of
new
applications
can
not
be
estimated
when
as
a
means
of
intercourse
at
least
its
network
shall
spread
through
every
village
bringing
all

of

into
the
closest

most
intimate
relations
of

it
has
already
achieved
one
important
national
result
it
has
made
possible
on
this
continent
a
yet
closely
linked
empire
of
states
such
as
our
fathers
never
imagined
the
highest
office
of
the
electric

in
the
future
is
thus
to
be
the
promotion
of

peace

sardinia
has

is
from
ten
to
twelve
miles
on
the
average
and
the
number
of
them
is
about
in
france
the
use
of
the
electric
telegraph
has
rapidly
increased
within
the
last
few
years
in
the
number
of
despatches
transmitted
was
which
produced
francs
in
there
were
despatches
transmitted
producing
francs
during
the
last
four
years
that
is
to
say
since
all
the
chief
towns
in
france
have
been
in
electric
communication
with
paris
and
consequently
with
each
other
there
have
been
sent
by
private
individuals
despatches
which
have
produced
francs
out
of
the
despatches
exchanged
during
the
last
three
months
of
were
with
paris
and
with
the
thirty
most
important
towns
of
france
these
despatches
are
divided
as
to
their
object
or
nature
as
follows
private
and
family

and

sundry
affairs
in
australia
the
electric
telegraph
is
in
constant
use
affording
a
remunerating
revenue
and
the
amount
of
business
has
forced
on
the
government
the
necessity
of
additional
wires
cuba
has
six
hundred
miles
of
wire
in
operation
messages
can
be
transmitted
only
in
spanish
and
the
closest
surveillance
is
maintained
by
the
government
officials
over
all
despatches
offered
for
transmission
from
the
fact
that
no
less
than
a
dozen
errors
occurred
in
a
dispatch
transmitted
by
a
boston
gentleman
from
cardenas
to
havana
we
judge
that
the
telegraphic
apparatus
invented
by
our
american
professor
house
rebels
at
such
petty
tyranny
several
hundred
miles
of
electric
telegraph
have
been
constructed
in
mexico
but
the
unfortunate
condition
of
the
country
for
the
last
few
years
has
precluded
the
possibility
of
maintaining
it
in
working
order
and
it
has
like
everything
else
in
the
land
of
monteznma
gone
to
decay
the
english
and
dutch
governments
have
come
to
an
understanding
upon
a
system
of
cables
which
will
unite
india
and
australia
and
eventually
be
extended
to
china
the
arrangements
between
the
governments
are
that
the
indian
and
imperial
governments
shall
connect
india
with
singapore
that
the
dutch
government
shall
connect
singapore
with
the
southeast
point
of
java
that
the
australian
governments
shall
connect
their
continent
with
java
the
cable
for
the
section
was
to
have
been
laid
during
the
last
month
the
section
is
to
be
laid
this
spring
and
the
connection
with
australia
will
it
is
believed
be
completed
in
the
course
of
next
year
the
red
sea
and
india
telegraph
company
have
announced
the
arrangements
under
which
they
are
prepared
to
transmit
messages
for
the
public
between
alexandria
and
aden
messages
for
australia
and
china
will
be
forwarded
by
post
from
aden
it
is
considered
probable
that
a
direct
communication
with
alexandria
will
be
established
through
constantinople
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
and
then
the
news
from
india
will
reach
london
in
ten
or
eleven
days
a
late
european
steamer
brings
a
report
that
two
russian
engineers
have
proceeded
to
pekin
china
to
make
preparations
for
a
telegraphic
connection
between
that
place
and
the
russian
territory
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
arrangements
will
soon
be
made
at
petersburg
through
private
companies
and
government
subsidies
for
completing
the
line
of
telegraph
from
novgorod
to
the
mouth
of
the
amoor
and
thence
across
the
straits
to
russian
america
in
the
mean
time
a
company
has
already
been
formed
and
incorporated
in
canada
under
the
name
of
the
transmundane
telegraphic
company
which
will
afford
important
aid
in
continuing
the
proposed
line
through
british
america
the
plan
is
to
carry
the
wires
from
the
mouth
of
the
amoor
across
behring
strait
to
and
through
russian
and
british
america
from
victoria
a
branch
will
be
extended
to
san
francisco
and
another
to
canada
the
line
from
san
francisco
to
missouri
is
under
way
and
collins
who
is
engaged
in
the
russian
and
canadian
enterprise
thinks
that
by
the
time
it
is
in
operation
he
shall
have
extended
his
line
to
san
francisco
this
is
unquestionably
the
most
feasible
route
for
telegraphic
communication
between
america
and
europe
and
though
the
longest
by
several
thousand
miles
it
would
afford
the
most
rapid
means
of
communication
owing
to
the
great
superiority
of
aërial
over
subaqueous
lines
no
limit
has
yet
been
found
to
aërial
telegraphing
for
by
inserting
transferrers
into
the
more
extended
circuits
renewed
energy
can
be
attained
and
lines
of
several
thousands
of
miles
in
length
can
be
worked
if
properly
insulated
as
surely
as
those
of
a
hundred
the
lines
between
new
york
and
new
orleans
are
frequently
connected
together
by
means
of
transferrers
and
direct
communication
is
had
over
a
distance
of
more
than
two
thousand
miles
no
perceptible
retardation
of
the
current
takes
place
on
the
contrary
the
lines
so
connected
work
as
successfully
as
when
divided
into
shorter
circuits
this
is
not
the
case
with
subaqueous
lines
the
employment
of
submarine
as
well
as
of
subterranean
conductors
occasions
a
small
retardation
in
the
velocity
of
the
transmitted
electricity
this
retardation
is
not
due
to
the
length
of
the
path
which
the
electric
current
has
to
traverse
since
it
does
not
take
place
with
a
conductor
equally
long
insulated
in
the
air
it
arises
as
faraday
has
demonstrated
from
a
static
reaction
which
is
determined
by
the
introduction
of
a
current
into
a
conductor
well
insulated
but
surrounded
outside
its
insulating
coating
by
a
conducting
body
such
as
or
moist
ground
or
even
simply
by
the
metallic
envelope
of
iron
wires
placed
in
communication
with
the
ground
when
this
conductor
is
presented
to
one
of
the
poles
of
a
battery
the
other
pole
of
which
communicates
with
the
ground
it
becomes
charged
with
static
electricity
like
the
coating
of
a
leyden
jar
electricity
which
is
capable
of
giving
rise
to
a
discharge
current
even
after
the
voltaic
current
has
ceased
to
be
transmitted
professor
wheatstone
experimented
upon
the
cable
intended
to
unite
la
spezia
upon
the
coast
of
piedmont
with
the
island
of
corsica
it
was
one
hundred
and
ten
miles
in
length
and
contained
six
copper
wires
of
an
inch
in
diameter
individually
insulated
and
each
covered
with
a
coating
of
of
an
inch
in
thickness
the
cable
was
coiled
in
a
dry
pit
in
the
yard
with
its
two
ends
accessible
the
ends
of
the
different
wires
could
be
united
so
as
to
make
of
all
these
wires
merely
one
wire
six
hundred
and
sixty
miles
in
length
through
which
the
electric
current
could
circulate
in
the
same
direction
this
current
was
itself
furnished
by
an
insulated
battery
formed
of
one
hundred
and
wheatstone
pairs
equal
to
fifty
of
grove
in
the
first
series
of
experiments
it
was
proved
that
if
one
of
the
ends
of
the
long
wire
whose
other
end
remained
insulated
were
made
to
communicate
with
one
of
the
poles
of
the
battery
the
wire
became
charged
with
the
electricity
of
that
pole
which
so
long
as
it
existed
gave
rise
to
a
current
which
was
made
evident
by
a
galvanometer
but
in
order
to
obtain
this
result
the
second
pole
of
the
battery
must
communicate
with
the
ground
or
with
another
long
wire
similar
to
the
first
in
a
second
series
of
experiments
professor
wheatstone
interposed
three
galvanometers
in
the
middle
and
at
the
ends
of
the
circuit
determining
in
this
manner
the
progress
of
the
current
by
the
order
which
they
followed
in
their
deviation
if
the
two
poles
of
the
battery
were
connected
by
the
long
conductor
of
six
hundred
and
sixty
miles
the
precaution
having
been
taken
to
divide
it
into
two
portions
of
equal
length
it
was
observed
on
connecting
the
two
free
extremities
of
these
two
portions
in
order
to
close
the
circuit
that
the
galvanometer
placed
in
the
middle
was
the
first
to
be
deflected
whilst
the
galvanometers
placed
in
the
vicinity
of
the
poles
were
not
deflected
until
later
by
a
third
series
of
experiments
wheatstone
with
the
galvanometer
has
shown
that
a
continuous
current
may
be
maintained
in
the
circuit
of
the
long
wire
of
an
electric
cable
of
which
one
of
the
ends
is
insulated
whilst
the
other
communicates
with
one
of
the
poles
of
a
battery
whose
other
pole
is
connected
with
the
ground
this
current
is
due
to
the
uniform
and
continual
dispersion
of
the
statical
electricity
with
which
the
wire
is
charged
along
its
whole
length
as
would
happen
to
any
other
conducting
body
placed
in
an
insulating
medium
it
was
owing
to
the
retardation
from
this
cause
that
communication
through
the
atlantic
cable
was
so
exceedingly
slow
and
difficult
and
not
as
many
suppose
because
the
cable
was
defective
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
fault
in
the
cable
discovered
by
varley
before
it
left
queenstown
but
it
was
not
of
so
serious
a
character
as
to
offer
any
substantial
obstacle
to
the
passage
of
the
electric
current
as
everything
pertaining
to
the
actual
operation
of
the
atlantic
cable
has
been
studiously
withheld
from
the
public
until
it
has
come
to
be
seriously
doubted
whether
any
despatches
were
ever
transmitted
through
it
we
presume
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
give
the
actual
of
this
great
wonder
and
mystery
the
only
instrument
which
could
be
used
successfully
in
signalling
through
the
atlantic
cable
was
one
of
peculiar
construction
by
professor
thompson
called
the
marine
galvanometer
in
this
instrument
momentum
and
inertia
are
almost
wholly
avoided
by
the
use
of
a
needle
weighing
only
one
and
a
half
grains
combined
with
a
mirror
reflecting
a
ray
of
light
which
indicates
deflections
with
great
accuracy
by
these
means
a
gradually
increasing
or
decreasing
current
is
at
each
instant
indicated
at
its
due
strength
thus
when
this
galvanometer
is
placed
as
the
receiving
instrument
at
the
end
of
a
long
submarine
cable
the
movement
of
the
spot
of
light
consequent
on
the
completion
of
a
circuit
through
the
battery
cable
and
earth
can
be
so
observed
as
to
furnish
a
curve
representing
very
accurately
the
arrival
of
an
electric
current
lines
representing
successive
signals
at
various
speeds
can
also
be
obtained
and
by
means
of
a
metronome
dots
dashes
successive
can
be
sent
with
nearly
perfect
regularity
by
an
ordinary
morse
key
and
the
corresponding
changes
in
the
current
at
the
receiving
end
of
the
cable
accurately
observed
the
strength
of
the
battery
employed
was
found
to
have
no
influence
on
the
results
curves
given
by
batteries
of
different
strengths
could
be
made
to
coincide
by
simply
drawing
them
to
scales
proportionate
to
the
strengths
of
the
two
currents
it
was
also
found
that
the
same
curve
represented
the
gradual
increase
of
intensity
due
to
the
arrival
of
a
current
and
the
gradual
decrease
due
to
the
ceasing
of
that
current
the
possible
speed
of
signalling
was
found
to
be
very
nearly
proportional
to
the
squares
of
the
lengths
spoken
through
thus
a
speed
which
gave
fifteen
dots
per
minute
in
a
length
of
nautical
miles
reproduced
all
the
effects
given
by
a
speed
of
thirty
dots
in
a
length
of
at
these
speeds
with
ordinary
morse
signals
speaking
would
be
barely
possible
in
the
red
sea
a
speed
of
from
seven
to
eight
words
per
minute
was
attained
in
a
length
of
nautical
miles
mechanical
senders
and
attention
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
contacts
would
materially
increase
the
speed
at
which
signals
of
any
kind
could
be
transmitted
the
best
trained
hand
can
not
equal
the
accuracy
of
mechanism
and
the
slightest
irregularity
causes
the
current
to
rise
or
fall
quite
beyond
the
limits
required
for
distinct
signals
no
important
difference
was
observed
between
signals
sent
by
alternate
reverse
currents
and
those
sent
by
the
more
usual
method
the
amount
of
oscillation
and
the
consequent
distinctness
of
signalling
were
nearly
the
same
in
the
two
cases
an
advantage
in
the
first
signals
sent
is
however
obtained
by
the
use
of
and
halske
submarine
key
by
which
the
cable
is
put
to
earth
immediately
on
signalling
being
interrupted
and
the
wire
thus
kept
at
a
potential
between
the
potentials
of
the
poles
of
two
batteries
employed
and
the
first
signals
become
legible
which
with
the
ordinary
key
would
be
employed
in
charging
the
wire
a
system
of
arbitrary
characters
similar
to
those
used
upon
the
morse
telegraph
was
employed
and
the
letter
to
be
indicated
was
determined
by
the
number
of
oscillations
of
the
needle
as
well
as
by
the
length
of
time
during
which
the
needle
remained
in
one
place
the
operator
who
watched
the
reflection
of
the
deflected
needle
in
the
mirror
had
a
key
communicating
with
a
local
instrument
in
the
office
in
his
hand
which
he
pressed
down
or
raised
as
the
needle
was
deflected
and
another
operator
occupied
himself
in
deciphering
the
characters
thus
produced
upon
the
paper
as
the
operator
at
trinity
bay
had
no
means
of
arresting
the
operations
at
valentia
and
and
as
the
fastest
rate
of
speed
over
the
cable
could
not
exceed
three
words
per
minute
it
will
not
surprise
the
reader
that
the
operators
were
nearly
two
days
in
transmitting
the
queen
despatch
however
notwithstanding
all
the
difficulties
in
the
way
there
were
transmitted
from
ireland
to
newfoundland
through
the
atlantic
cable
between
the
of
august
and
the
of
september
messages
containing
words
and
from
newfoundland
to
ireland
messages
and
words
making
a
total
of
messages
containing
words
among
these
were
the
message
from
the
queen
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
his
reply
the
one
announcing
the
safety
of
the
steamer
europa
her
mails
and
passengers
after
her
collision
with
the
arabia
and
two
messages
for
her
majesty
which
last
effected
a
very
large
saving
to
the
revenue
of
the
english
government
in
liverpool
have
already
been
subscribed
to
the
project
of
completing
or
relaying
the
atlantic
cable
a
contract
has
been
recently
made
by
the
english
government
for
a
cable
to
be
laid
from
falmouth
to
gibraltar
miles
which
is
to
be
ready
in
june
next
this
will
be
succeeded
by
one
from
gibraltar
to
malta
and
alexandria
thus
giving
england
an
independent
line
free
from
continental
difficulties
steamers
were
to
have
left
liverpool
at
the
end
of
the
last
month
with
the
remainder
of
the
cable
to
connect
kurrachee
with
aden
the
cable
to
connect
alexandria
with
england
is
now
to
be
laid
through
the
islands
of
rhodes
and
scio
to
constantinople
and
not
by
way
of
candia
as
previously
intended
it
is
expected
to
be
laid
this
season
hellaniyah
one
of
the
islands
has
been
decided
on
as
a
station
for
the
red
sea
telegraph
the
new
electric
cable
between
malta
and
the
opposite
coast
of
sicily
at
alga
grande
is
safely
laid
two
previous
attempts
had
been
made
but
in
consequence
of
the
late
strong
winds
nothing
could
be
done
the
shore
end
on
the
malta
side
had
been
laid
down
and
connected
with
the
company
offices
before
the
expedition
started
the
outer
end
about
one
mile
off
the
marsamuscetto
harbor
into
which
the
cable
has
been
taken
being
buoyed
ready
to
complete
the
communication
from
shore
to
shore
the
moment
the
cable
was
submerged
the
operation
of
paying
out
the
cable
was
completed
without
the
least
accident
the
of
the
cable
is
of
great
strength
being
able
to
sustain
a
strain
of
ten
or
twelve
tons
without
parting
and
the
shore
ends
are
of
nearly
double
that
strength
the
depth
of
water
throughout
is
within
eighty
fathoms
so
that
if
any
accident
should
ever
occur
it
may
be
remedied
without
much
difficulty
a
great
change
in
the
rates
to
sicily
and
the
italian
states
will
result
from
the
completion
of
this
new
line
a
reduction
in
some
cases
of
per
cent
being
made
a
great
boon
to
the
english
merchants
messages
in
french
english
or
italian
will
be
transmitted
and
we
must
congratulate
the
company
upon
their
success
in
inducing
the
neapolitan
government
to
make
this
concession
and
upon
the
exceedingly
low
tariff
proposed
de
sauty
is
the
electrician
of
this
company
he
will
be
remembered
by
the
reader
as
the
mysterious
operator
at
trinity
bay
from
whom
an
occasional
vague
and
exceedingly
brief
despatch
was
received
in
relation
to
the
working
of
the
cable
nothing
really

electric
telegraphy
in
the
ottoman
empire
has
within
a
few
months
had
a
remarkable
development
several
lines
are
already
in
course
of
construction
a
direct
line
from
varna
to
toultcha
passing
by
baltschik
a
line
from
toultcha
to
odessa
passing
by
reni
and
joining
the
russian
telegraph
at
ismail
the
subaqueous
cable
from
toultcha
to
reni
on
the
danube
is
the
sixth
in
the
ottoman
empire
this
line
which
will
place
constantinople
in
direct
communication
with
odessa
will
not
only
have
the
advantage
of
increasing
and
accelerating
the
communications
but
will
very
considerably
reduce
their
cost
there
is
also
to
be
a
line
from
rodosto
to
enos
and
salonica
and
from
salonica
to
monastir
valona
and
scutari
in
albania
the
line
from
salonica
to
monastir
and
valona
will
be
joined
by
a
submarine
cable
crossing
the
adriatic
to
otranto
and
carried
on
to
naples
it
will
have
the
effect
of
placing
southern
italy
in
communication
with
constantinople
and
also
of
reducing
the
cost
of
messages
a
convention
to
this
effect
has
been
signed
by
a
delegate
of
the
neapolitan
government
and
the
of
the
telegraphic
lines
of
the
ottoman
empire
touching
this
line
to
naples
the
ratification
of
the
two
governments
will
shortly
be
given
to
this
convention
a
line
from
scutari
in
albania
to
and
thence
to
castellastua
passing
round
the
montenegrin
territory
by
a
submarine
cable
this
line
is
already
laid
and
will
begin
working
immediately
on
the
completion
of
the
austrian
lines
to
the
point
where
it
ends
a
line
from
constantinople
to
bagdad
three
sections
of
this
are
being
simultaneously
laid
down
the
first
from
constantinople
to
ismid
angora
yuzgat
and
sivas
the
works
on
this
have
been
already
carried
to
sabanja
between
ismid
and
angora
the
second
section
from
sivas
to
moussoul
the
works
on
this
line
are
in
a
state
of
favorable
preparation
and
the
line
will
be
actively
gone
on
with
the
third
section
from
bagdad
to
moussoul
for
this
also
the
preparations
have
been
made
and
the
works
will
begin
when
the
season
opens
the
materials
being
all
ready
along
the
line
from
bagdad
this
line
will
extend
to
bassora
to
join
a
submarine
cable
to
be
carried
thence
to
british
india
a
projected
line
from
constantinople
to
smyrna
for
this
two
routes
are
thought
of
one
the
shortest
but
most
difficult
would
run
from
constantinople
to
the
dardanelles
adramyti
and
smyrna
the
other
the
longest
but
offering
fewest
difficulties
would
pass
from
constantinople
by
muhalitch
and
maneesa
to
smyrna
a
line
from
mostar
to
mostar
is
already
connected
with
the
austrian
telegraphs
at
metcovich
other
lines
have
been
in
the
mean
time
completed
and
extended
and
will
soon
be
opened
to
the
public
thus
a
third
and
fourth
wire
are
being
laid
on
the
line
from
constantinople
to
rodosto
from
the
latter
point
three
wires
have
been
carried
to
gallipoli
and
the
dardanelles
two
of
which
are
for
messages
from
gallipoli
to
the
dardanelles
and
the
third
is
to
join
the
submarine
cable
connecting
constantinople
candia
syra
and
the
piraeus
the
communications
between
constantinople
and
candia
would
already
have
begun
but
for
an
accident
to
the
engineer
those
with
syra
and
the
piraeus
will
begin
as
soon
as
the
ratification
of
the
convention
entered
into
between
the
ottoman
and
greek
governments
on
this
subject
shall
have
taken
place
the
laying
of
the
cable
between
candia
and
alexandria
which
has
not
yet
succeeded
will
be
resumed
this
spring
thus
after
the
completion
of
these
lines
constantinople
will
be
in
communication
with
nearly
all
the
chief
provinces
and
towns
of
the
empire
with
africa
and
with
europe
by
five
different
channels
by
the
principalities
by
odessa
by
servia
by
dalmatia
and
the
kingdom
of
the
two
sicilies
with
such
a
development
of
the
system
it
will
be
imperatively
necessary
to
increase
the
telegraphic
already
the
number
of
despatches
arriving
every
day
renders
the
service
very
difficult
and
occasions
much
confusion
and
many
grievous
mistakes
nothing
is
easier
than
to
remedy
all
this
by
increasing
the
number
of
the
the
great
distinguishing
feature
of
the
telegraphs
used
in
great
britain
is
that
they
are
of
the
class
known
as
oscillating
telegraphs
that
is
telègraphs
in
which
the
letters
are
denoted
by
the
number
of
motions
to
the
right
or
left
of
a
needle
or
indicator
those
of
france
are
of
the
class
called
dial
telegraphs
in
which
an
index
or
needle
is
carried
around
the
face
of
a
dial
around
the
circumference
of
which
are
placed
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
any
particular
letter
being
designated
by
the
brief
stopping
of
the
needle
a
similar
system
has
been
used
in
prussia
but
recently
the
american
or
recording
instrument
of
professor
morse
has
been
introduced
into
this
as
well
as
every
other
european
country
and
even
in
england
the
national
prejudice
is
gradually
giving
way
and
our
american
system
is
being
introduced
in
america
none
but
recording
instruments
have
ever
been
used
of
these
we
have
many
kinds
but
only
five
are
in
operation
at
present
namely
the
timing
instrument
of
professor
morse
the
printing
of
house
the
synchronous
printing
of
hughes
the
rhythmic
of
bain
and
the
combining
the
essential
parts
of
the
hughes
instrument
with
portions
of
the
house
the
morse
apparatus
is
however
most
generally
used
in
this
country
and
every
other
out
of
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
of
electric
telegraph
now
in
operation
or
in
the
course
of
construction
in
the
world
at
least
two
hundred
thousand
give
the
preference
to
it
although
the
morse
apparatus
is
a
recording
one
yet
for
the
last
six
years
the
operators
in
this
country
have
discontinued
the
use
of
the
paper
and
confined
themselves
to
reading
by
the
ear
which
they
do
with
the
greatest
facility
by
this
means
a
great
saving
is
made
in
the
expense
of
working
the
telegraph
and
far
greater
correctness
insured
as
the
ear
is
found
much
more
reliable
in
comprehending
the
clicks
of
the
instrument
than
the
eye
in
deciphering
the
arbitrary
alphabet
of
dots
and
lines
the
rapidity
of
the
several
instruments
in
use
may
be
given
as

to
a

extent
and
in
cuba
hughes
and
the
combination
instruments
the
three
last
systems
are
american
inventions
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
to
our
country
is
due
the
credit
of
inventing
the
most
rapid
and
the
most
universally
used
telegraphic
systems
but
though
we
surpass
all
other
nations
in
the
value
of
our
electric
apparatus
we
are
far
behind
many
and
indeed
most
countries
in
the
construction
of
our
lines
this
does
not
arise
from
want
of
knowledge
or
of
means
but
from
the
custom
which
obtains
to
a
great
extent
among
all
classes
and
professions
in
this
country
of
providing
something
which
will
answer
for
a
time
instead
of
securing
a
permanent
success
but
to
my
mind
though
i
am
native
here
and
to
the
manner
born
it
is
a
custom
more
honored
it
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
especially
in
building
lines
of
electric
telegraph
where
the
best
are
always
the
cheapest
when
shakspeare
made
puck
promise
to
put
a
girdle
round
about
the
earth
in
forty
minutes
he
undoubtedly
supposed
he
would
thereby
accomplish
a
remarkable
feat
but
when
the
great
line
strait
and
the
amoor
is
completed
and
the
atlantic
cable
is
again
in
operation
we
can
put
an
electric
girdle
round
about
the
earth
before
puck
could
have
time
to
spread
his
wings
in
view
of
what
must
actually
take
place
at
no
distant
day
the
girdling
of
the
earth
by
the
electric
wires
a
singular
question
arises
if
we
send
a
current
of
electricity
east
it
will
lose
hours
in
going
round
the
globe
if
we
send
one
west
it
will
gain
or
in
other
words
will
get
back
to
the
hours
before
it
sets
out
now
if
we
send
a
current
round
the
world
it
will
get
there
twelve
hours
in
advance
of
or
twelve
hours
behind
our
time
according
as
we
send
it
east
or
west
the
question
which
naturally
suggests
itself
therefore
is
what
is
the
time
at
the
antipodes
is
it
or
love
and
friendless
when
you
are
gone
but
jean
you
surely
do
not
mean
that
effie
has
no
claim
on
any
human
creature
beyond
the
universal
one
of
common
charity
i
said
as
she
ceased
and
lay
panting
on
her
pillows
with
her
sunken
eyes
fixed
eagerly
upon
my
own
ay
sir
i
do
for
her
grandfather
has
never
by
word
or
deed
acknowledged
her
or
paid
the
least
heed
to
the
letter
her
poor
mother
sent
him
from
her
dying
bed
seven
years
ago
he
is
a
lone
old
man
and
this
child
is
the
last
of
his
name
yet
he
will
not
see
her
and
cares
little
whether
she
be
dead
or
living
it
a
bitter
shame
sir
and
the
memory
of
it
will
rise
up
before
him
when
he
comes
to
lie
where
i
am
lying
now
and
you
have
kept
the
girl
safe
in
the
shelter
of
your
honest
home
all
these
years
heaven
will
remember
that
and
in
the
great
record
of
good
deeds
will
set
the
name
of
adam
lyndsay
far
below
that
of
poor
jean
burns
i
said
pressing
the
thin
hand
that
had
succored
the
orphan
in
her
need
but
jean
took
no
honor
to
herself
for
that
charity
and
answered
simply
to
my
words
of
commendation
sir
her
mother
was
my
and
when
she
left
that
stern
old
man
for
love
of
walter
home
i
went
too
for
love
of
her
ah
dear
heart
she
had
sore
need
of
me
in
the
weary
wanderings
which
ended
only
when
she
lay
down
by
her
dead
husband
side
and
left
her
bairn
to
me
then
i
came
here
to
cherish
her
among
kind
souls
where
i
was
born
and
here
she
has
grown
up
an
innocent
young
thing
safe
from
the
wicked
world
the
comfort
of
my
life
and
the
one
thing
i
grieve
at
leaving
when
the
time
that
is
drawing
very
near
shall
come
would
not
an
appeal
to
lyndsay
reach
him
now
think
you
might
not
effie
go
to
him
herself
surely
the
sight
of
such
a
winsome
creature
would
touch
his
heart
however
hard
but
jean
rose
up
in
her
bed
crying
almost
fiercely
no
sir
no
my
child
shall
never
go
to
beg
a
shelter
in
that
hard
man
house
i
know
too
well
the
cold
looks
the
cruel
words
that
would
sting
her
high
spirit
and
try
her
heart
as
they
did
her
mother
no
sir
rather
than
that
she
shall
go
with
lady
gower
lady
gower
what
has
she
to
do
with
effie
jean
i
asked
with
increasing
interest
she
will
take
effie
as
her
maid
sir
a
hard
life
for
my
child
but
what
can
i
do
and
jean
keen
glance
seemed
trying
to
read
mine
a
heaven
forbid
i
ejaculated
as
a
vision
of
that
haughty
lady
and
her
three
wild
sons
swept
through
my
mind
i
rose
paced
the
room
in
silence
for
a
little
time
then
took
a
sudden
resolution
and
turning
to
the
bed
exclaimed
jean
i
will
adopt
effie
i
am
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
she
shall
never
feel
the
want
of
one
if
you
will
give
her
to
my
care
to
my
surprise
jean
eager
face
wore
a
look
of
disappointment
as
she
listened
and
with
a
sigh
replied
that
a
kind
thought
sir
and
a
generous
one
but
it
can
not
be
as
you
wish
you
may
be
twice
her
age
but
still
too
young
for
that
how
could
effie
look
into
that
face
of
yours
so
bonnie
sir
for
all
it
is
so
grave
and
seeing
never
a
wrinkle
on
the
forehead
nor
a
white
hair
among
the
black
how
could
she
call
you
father
no
it
will
not
do
though
so
kindly
meant
your
friends
would
laugh
at
you
sir
and
idle
tongues
might
speak
ill
of
my
bairn
then
what
can
i
do
jean
i
asked
regretfully
make
her
your
wife
sir
i
turned
sharply
and
stared
at
the
woman
as
her
abrupt
reply
reached
my
ear
though
trembling
for
the
consequences
of
her
boldly
spoken
wish
jean
did
not
shrink
from
my
astonished
gaze
and
when
i
saw
the
wistfulness
of
that
wan
face
the
smile
died
on
my
lips
checked
by
the
tender
courage
which
had
prompted
the
utterance
of
her
dying
hope
my
good
jean
you
forget
that
effie
is
a
child
and
i
a
moody
solitary
man
with
no
gifts
to
win
a
wife
or
make
home
happy
effie
is
sixteen
sir
a
fair
good
lassie
for
her
years
and
you
ah
sir
may
call
yourself
unfit
for
wife
and
home
but
the
poorest
saddest
creature
in
this
place
knows
that
the
man
whose
hand
is
always
open
whose
heart
is
always
pitiful
is
not
the
one
to
live
alone
but
to
win
and
to
deserve
a
happy
home
and
a
true
wife
oh
sir
forgive
me
if
i
have
been
too
bold
but
my
time
is
short
and
i
love
my
child
so
well
i
can
not
leave
the
desire
of
my
heart
unspoken
for
it
is
my
last
as
the
words
fell
brokenly
from
her
lips
and
tears
streamed
down
her
pallid
cheek
a
great
pity
took
possession
of
me
the
old
longing
to
find
some
solace
for
my
solitary
life
returned
again
and
peace
seemed
to
smile
on
me
from
little
effie
eyes
jean
i
said
give
me
till
to
consider
this
new
thought
i
fear
it
can
not
be
but
i
have
learned
to
love
the
child
too
well
to
see
her
thrust
out
from
the
shelter
of
your
home
to
walk
through
this
evil
world
alone
i
will
consider
your
proposal
and
endeavor
to
devise
some
future
for
the
child
which
shall
set
your
heart
at
rest
but
before
you
urge
this
further
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
not
what
you
think
me
i
am
a
cold
selfish
man
often
gloomy
often
stern
a
most
unfit
guardian
for
a
tender
creature
like
this
little
girl
the
deeds
of
mine
which
you
call
kind
are
not
true
charities
it
frets
me
to
see
pain
and
i
desire
my
ease
above
all
earthly
things
you
are
grateful
for
the
little
i
have
done
for
you
and
deceive
yourself
regarding
my
true
worth
but
of
one
thing
you
may
rest
assured
i
am
an
honest
man
who
holds
his
name
too
high
to
stain
it
with
a
false
word
or
a
dishonorable
deed
i
do
believe
you
sir
jean
answered
eagerly
and
if
i
left
the
child
to
you
i
could
die
this
night
in
peace
indeed
sir
i
never
should
have
dared
to
speak
of
this
but
for
the
belief
that
you
loved
the
girl
what
else
could
i
think
when
you
came
so
often
and
were
so
kind
to
us
i
can
not
blame
you
jean
it
was
my
usual
forgetfulness
of
others
which
so
misled
you
i
was
tired
of
the
world
and
came
hither
to
find
peace
in
solitude
effie
cheered
me
with
her
winsome
ways
and
i
learned
to
look
on
her
as
the
blithe
spirit
whose
artless
wiles
won
me
to
forget
a
bitter
past
and
a
regretful
present
i
paused
and
then
added
with
a
smile
but
in
our
wise
schemes
we
have
overlooked
one
point
effie
does
not
love
me
and
may
decline
the
future
you
desire
me
to
offer
her
a
vivid
hope
lit
those
dim
eyes
as
jean
met
my
smile
with
one
far
brighter
and
joyfully
replied
she
love
you
sir
for
you
have
given
her
the
greatest
happiness
she
has
ever
known
last
night
she
sat
looking
silently
into
the
fire
there
with
a
strange
gloom
on
her
bonnie
face
and
when
i
asked
what
she
was
dreaming
of
she
turned
to
me
with
a
look
of
pain
and
fear
as
if
dismayed
at
some
great
loss
but
she
only
said
is
going
jean
what
shall
i
do
poor
child
she
will
miss
her
friend
and
teacher
when
i
gone
and
i
shall
miss
the
only
human
creature
that
has
seemed
to
care
for
me
for
years
i
sighed
adding
as
i
paused
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
say
nothing
of
this
to
effie
till
i
come
jean
i
went
away
and
far
out
on
the
lonely
moor
sat
down
to
think
like
a
weird
magician
memory
led
me
back
into
the
past
calling
up
the
hopes
and
passions
buried
there
my
childhood
fatherless
and
motherless
but
not
unhappy
for
no
wish
was
ungratified
no
idle
whim
denied
my
boyhood
with
no
shadows
over
it
but
those
my
own
wayward
will
called
up
my
manhood
when
the
great
joy
of
my
life
arose
my
love
for
agnes
a
midsummer
dream
of
bloom
and
bliss
so
and
so
sweet
i
felt
again
the
pang
that
wrung
my
heart
when
she
coldly
gave
me
back
the
pledge
i
thought
so
sacred
and
so
sure
and
the
music
of
her
tolled
the
knell
of
my
lost
love
i
seemed
to
hear
them
still
wafted
across
the
purple
moor
through
the
silence
of
those
fifteen
years
my
life
looked
gray
and
joyless
as
the
wide
waste
lying
hushed
around
me
unblessed
with
the
verdure
of
a
single
hope
a
single
love
and
as
i
looked
down
the
coming
years
my
way
seemed
very
solitary
very
dark
suddenly
a
lark
soared
upward
from
the
heath
cleaving
the
silence
with
its
jubilant
song
the
sleeping
echoes
woke
the
dun
moor
seemed
to
smile
and
the
blithe
music
fell
like
dew
upon
my
gloomy
spirit
wakening
a
new
desire
what
this
bird
is
to
the
moor
might
little
effie
be
to
me
i
thought
within
myself
longing
to
possess
the
cheerful
spirit
which
had
power
to
gladden
me
yes
i
mused
the
old
home
will
seem
more
solitary
now
than
ever
and
if
i
can
not
win
the
lark
song
without
a
golden
fetter
i
will
give
it
one
and
while
it
sings
for
love
of
me
it
shall
not
know
a
want
or
fear
heaven
help
me
i
forgot
the
poor
return
i
made
my
lark
for
the
sweet
liberty
it
lost
all
that
night
i
pondered
the
altered
future
jean
had
laid
before
me
and
the
longer
i
looked
the
fairer
it
seemed
to
grow
wealth
i
cared
nothing
for
the
world
opinion
i
defied
ambition
had
departed
and
passion
i
believed
lay
dead
then
why
should
i
deny
myself
the
consolation
which
seemed
offered
to
me
i
would
accept
it
and
as
i
resolved
the
dawn
looked
in
at
me
fresh
and
fair
as
little
face
i
met
jean
with
a
smile
and
as
she
read
its
significance
aright
there
shone
a
sudden
peace
upon
her
countenance
more
touching
than
her
grateful
words
effie
came
singing
from
the
as
unconscious
of
the
change
which
awaited
her
as
the
flowers
gathered
in
her
plaid
and
crowning
her
bright
hair
i
drew
her
to
my
side
and
in
the
simplest
words
asked
her
if
she
would
go
with
me
when
jean
long
guardianship
was
ended
joy
sorrow
and
surprise
stirred
the
sweet
composure
of
her
face
and
quickened
the
tranquil
beating
of
her
heart
but
as
i
ceased
joy
conquered
grief
and
wonder
for
she
clapped
her
hands
like
a
glad
child
exclaiming
go
with
you
sir
oh
if
you
knew
how
i
long
to
see
the
home
you
have
so
often
pictured
to
me
you
would
never
doubt
my
willingness
to
go
but
effie
you
do
not
understand
are
you
willing
to
go
with
me
as
my
wife
i
said
with
a
secret
sense
of
something
like
remorse
as
i
uttered
that
word
which
once
meant
so
much
to
me
and
now
seemed
such
an
empty
title
to
bestow
on
her
the
flowers
dropped
from
the
loosened
plaid
as
effie
looked
with
a
startled
glance
into
my
face
the
color
left
her
cheeks
and
the
smile
died
on
her
lips
but
a
timid
joy
lit
her
eye
as
she
softly
echoed
my
last
words
your
wife
it
sounds
very
solemn
though
so
sweet
ah
sir
i
am
not
wise
or
good
enough
for
that
a
child
humility
breathed
in
her
speech
but
something
of
a
fervor
shone
in
her
uplifted
countenance
and
sounded
in
the
sudden
tremor
of
her
voice
effie
i
want
you
as
you
are
i
said
no
wiser
dear
no
better
i
want
your
innocent
affection
to
appease
the
hunger
of
an
empty
heart
your
blithe
companionship
to
cheer
my
solitary
home
be
still
a
child
to
me
and
let
me
give
you
the
protection
of
my
name
effie
turned
to
her
old
friend
and
laying
her
young
face
on
the
pillow
close
beside
the
worn
one
grown
so
dear
to
her
asked
in
a
tone
half
pleading
half
regretful
dear
jean
shall
i
go
so
far
away
from
you
and
the
home
you
gave
me
when
i
had
no
other
my
bairn
i
shall
not
be
here
and
it
will
never
seem
like
home
with
old
jean
gone
it
is
the
last
wish
i
shall
ever
know
to
see
you
safe
with
this
good
gentleman
who
loves
my
child
go
dear
heart
and
be
happy
and
heaven
bless
and
keep
you
both
jean
held
her
fast
a
moment
and
then
with
a
whispered
prayer
put
her
gently
away
effie
came
to
me
saying
with
a
look
more
eloquent
than
her
meek
words
sir
i
will
be
your
wife
and
love
you
very
truly
all
my
life
i
drew
the
little
creature
to
my
breast
and
felt
a
tender
pride
in
knowing
she
was
mine
something
in
the
shy
caress
those
soft
arms
gave
touched
my
cold
nature
with
a
generous
warmth
and
the
innocence
of
that
confiding
heart
was
an
appeal
to
all
that
made
my
manhood
worth
possessing
swiftly
those
few
weeks
passed
and
when
old
jean
was
laid
to
her
last
sleep
little
effie
wept
her
grief
away
upon
her
husband
bosom
and
soon
learned
to
smile
in
her
new
english
home
its
gloom
departed
when
she
came
and
for
a
while
it
was
a
very
happy
place
my
bitter
moods
seemed
banished
by
the
magic
of
the
gentle
presence
that
made
sunshine
there
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
fresh
grace
added
to
the
life
so
wearisome
before
i
should
have
been
a
father
to
the
child
watchful
wise
and
tender
but
old
jean
was
right
i
was
too
young
to
feel
a
father
calm
affection
or
to
know
a
father
patient
care
i
should
have
been
her
teacher
striving
to
cultivate
the
nature
given
to
my
care
and
fit
it
for
the
trials
heaven
sends
to
all
i
should
have
been
a
friend
if
nothing
more
and
given
her
those
innocent
delights
that
make
youth
beautiful
and
its
memory
sweet
i
was
a
master
content
to
give
little
while
receiving
all
she
could
bestow
forgetting
her
loneliness
i
fell
back
into
my
old
way
of
life
i
shunned
the
world
because
its
gayeties
had
lost
their
zest
i
did
not
care
to
travel
for
home
now
possessed
a
charm
it
never
had
before
i
knew
there
was
an
eager
face
that
always
brightened
when
i
came
light
feet
that
flew
to
welcome
me
and
hands
that
loved
to
minister
to
every
want
of
mine
even
when
i
sat
engrossed
among
my
books
there
was
a
pleasant
consciousness
that
i
was
the
possessor
of
a
household
sprite
whom
a
look
could
summon
and
a
gesture
banish
i
loved
her
as
i
loved
a
picture
or
a
flower
a
little
better
than
my
horse
and
hound
but
far
less
than
i
loved
my
most
unworthy
self
and
she
always
so
blithe
when
i
was
by
so
diligent
in
studying
my
desires
so
full
of
simple
arts
to
win
my
love
and
prove
her
gratitude
she
never
asked
for
any
boon
and
seemed
content
to
live
alone
with
me
in
that
still
place
so
utterly
unlike
the
home
she
had
left
i
had
not
learned
to
read
that
true
heart
then
i
saw
those
happy
eyes
grow
wistful
when
i
went
leaving
her
alone
i
missed
the
roses
from
her
cheek
faded
for
want
of
gentler
care
and
when
the
buoyant
spirit
which
had
been
her
chiefest
charm
departed
i
fancied
in
my
blindness
that
she
pined
for
the
free
air
of
the
highlands
and
tried
to
win
it
back
by
transient
tenderness
and
costly
gifts
but
i
had
robbed
my
lark
of
heaven
sunshine
and
it
could
not
sing
i
met
agnes
again
she
was
a
widow
and
to
my
eye
seemed
fairer
than
when
i
saw
her
last
and
far
more
kind
some
soft
regret
seemed
shining
on
me
from
those
lustrous
eyes
as
if
she
hoped
to
win
my
pardon
for
that
early
wrong
i
never
could
forget
the
deed
that
darkened
my
best
years
but
the
old
charm
stole
over
me
at
times
and
turning
from
the
meek
child
at
my
feet
i
owned
the
power
of
the
stately
woman
whose
smile
seemed
a
command
i
meant
no
wrong
to
effie
but
looking
on
her
as
a
child
i
forgot
the
higher
claim
i
had
given
her
as
a
wife
and
walking
blindly
on
my
selfish
way
i
crushed
the
little
flower
i
should
have
cherished
in
my
breast
effie
my
old
friend
agnes
vaughan
is
coming
here
so
make
yourself
fair
that
you
may
do
honor
to
my
choice
for
she
desires
to
see
you
and
i
wish
my
scotch
harebell
to
look
lovely
to
this
english
rose
i
said
half
playfully
half
earnestly
as
we
stood
together
looking
out
across
the
flowery
lawn
one
summer
day
do
you
like
me
to
be
pretty
sir
she
answered
with
a
flush
of
pleasure
on
her
upturned
face
i
will
try
to
make
myself
fair
with
the
gifts
you
are
always
heaping
on
me
but
even
then
i
fear
i
shall
not
do
you
honor
nor
please
your
friend
i
am
so
small
and
young
a
careless
reply
was
on
my
lips
but
seeing
what
a
long
way
down
the
little
figure
was
i
drew
it
nearer
saying
with
a
smile
which
i
knew
would
make
an
answering
one
dear
there
must
be
the
bud
before
the
flower
so
never
grieve
for
your
youth
keeps
my
spirit
young
to
me
you
may
be
a
child
forever
but
you
must
learn
to
be
a
stately
little
madam
ventnor
to
my
friends
she
laughed
a
gayer
laugh
than
i
had
heard
for
many
a
day
and
soon
departed
intent
on
keeping
well
the
promise
she
had
given
an
hour
later
as
i
sat
busied
among
my
books
a
little
figure
glided
in
and
stood
before
me
with
its
jewelled
arms
demurely
folded
on
its
breast
it
was
effie
as
i
had
never
seen
her
before
some
new
freak
possessed
her
for
with
her
girlish
dress
she
seemed
to
have
laid
her
girlhood
by
the
brown
locks
were
gathered
up
wreathing
the
small
head
like
a
coronet
aerial
lace
and
silken
vesture
shimmered
in
the
light
and
became
her
well
she
looked
and
moved
a
fairy
queen
stately
and
small
i
watched
her
in
a
silent
maze
for
the
face
with
its
shy
blushes
and
downcast
eyes
did
not
seem
the
childish
one
turned
frankly
to
my
own
an
hour
ago
with
a
sigh
i
looked
up
at
agnes
picture
the
sole
ornament
of
that
room
and
when
i
withdrew
my
gaze
the
blooming
vision
had
departed
i
should
have
followed
it
to
make
my
peace
but
i
fell
into
a
fit
of
bitter
musing
and
forgot
it
till
agnes
voice
sounded
at
my
door
she
came
with
a
brother
and
seemed
eager
to
see
my
young
wife
but
effie
did
not
appear
and
i
excused
her
absence
as
a
girlish
freak
smiling
at
it
with
them
while
i
chafed
inwardly
at
her
neglect
forgetting
that
i
might
have
been
the
cause
pacing
down
the
garden
paths
with
agnes
at
my
side
our
steps
were
arrested
by
a
sudden
sight
of
effie
fast
asleep
among
the
flowers
she
looked
a
flower
herself
lying
with
her
flushed
cheek
pillowed
on
her
arm
sunshine
glittering
on
the
ripples
of
her
hair
and
the
changeful
lustre
of
her
dainty
dress
tears
moistened
her
long
lashes
but
her
lips
smiled
as
if
in
the
blissful
land
of
dreams
she
had
found
some
solace
for
her
grief
a
beauty
worthy
the
awakening
of
any
prince
whispered
alfred
vaughan
pausing
with
admiring
eyes
a
slight
frown
swept
over
agnes
face
but
vanished
as
she
said
with
that
laugh
that
never
seemed
unmusical
before
we
must
pardon
ventnor
seeming
rudeness
if
she
welcomes
us
with
graceful
scenes
like
this
a
whims
are
often
prettier
than
the
world
formal
ways
so
do
not
chide
her
basil
when
she
wakes
i
was
a
proud
man
then
touched
easily
by
trivial
things
pitying
manner
stung
me
and
the
tone
in
which
i
wakened
effie
was
far
harsher
than
it
should
have
been
she
sprang
up
and
with
a
gentle
dignity
most
new
to
me
received
her
guests
and
played
the
part
of
hostess
with
a
grace
that
well
atoned
for
her
offence
agnes
watched
her
silently
as
she
went
before
us
with
young
vaughan
and
even
i
ruffled
as
my
temper
was
felt
a
certain
pride
in
the
loving
creature
who
for
my
sake
conquered
her
timidity
and
strove
to
do
me
honor
but
neither
by
look
nor
word
did
i
show
my
satisfaction
for
agnes
demanded
the
constant
service
of
lips
and
eyes
and
i
was
only
too
ready
to
devote
them
to
the
woman
who
still
felt
her
power
and
dared
to
show
it
all
that
day
i
was
beside
her
forgetful
in
many
ways
of
the
gentle
courtesies
i
owed
the
child
whom
i
had
made
my
wife
i
did
not
see
the
wrong
then
but
others
did
and
the
deference
i
failed
to
show
she
could
ask
of
them
in
the
evening
as
i
stood
near
agnes
while
she
sang
the
songs
we
both
remembered
well
my
eye
fell
on
a
mirror
that
confronted
me
and
in
it
i
saw
effie
bending
forward
with
a
look
that
startled
me
some
strong
emotion
controlled
her
for
with
lips
apart
and
eager
eyes
she
gazed
keenly
at
the
countenances
she
believed
unconscious
of
her
scrutiny
agnes
caught
the
vision
that
had
arrested
the
compliment
upon
my
lips
and
turning
looked
at
effie
with
a
smile
just
touched
with
scorn
the
color
rose
vividly
to
effie
cheek
but
her
eyes
did
not
fall
they
sought
my
face
and
rested
there
a
crossed
my
lips
with
a
sudden
impulse
i
beckoned
and
she
came
with
such
an
altered
countenance
i
fancied
that
i
had
not
seen
aright
at
my
desire
she
sang
the
ballads
she
so
loved
and
in
her
girlish
voice
there
was
an
undertone
of
deeper
melody
than
when
i
heard
them
first
among
her
native
hills
for
the
child
heart
was
ripening
fast
into
the
woman
agnes
went
at
length
and
i
heard
effies
sigh
of
relief
when
we
were
left
alone
but
only
bid
her
go
and
rest
while
i
paced
to
and
fro
still
murmuring
the
refrain
of
agnes
song
the
vaughans
came
often
and
we
went
often
to
them
in
the
they
had
chosen
near
us
on
the
riverbank
i
followed
my
own
wayward
will
and
effie
wistful
eyes
grew
sadder
as
the
weeks
went
by
one
sultry
evening
as
we
strolled
together
on
the
balcony
i
was
seized
with
a
sudden
longing
to
hear
agnes
sing
and
bid
effie
come
with
me
for
a
moonlight
voyage
down
the
river
she
had
been
very
silent
all
the
evening
with
a
pensive
shadow
on
her
face
and
rare
smiles
on
her
lips
but
as
i
spoke
she
paused
abruptly
and
clenching
her
small
hands
turned
upon
me
with
defiant
eyes
crying
almost
fiercely
no
i
will
not
go
to
listen
to
that
woman
songs
i
hate
her
yes
more
than
i
can
tell
for
till
she
came
i
thought
you
loved
me
but
now
you
think
of
her
alone
and
chide
me
when
i
look
unhappy
you
treat
me
like
a
child
but
i
am
not
one
oh
sir
be
more
kind
for
i
have
only
you
to
love
and
as
her
voice
died
in
that
sad
appeal
she
clasped
her
hands
before
her
face
with
such
a
burst
of
tears
that
i
had
no
words
to
answer
her
disturbed
by
the
sudden
passion
of
the
hitherto
meek
girl
i
sat
down
on
the
wide
steps
of
the
balcony
and
essayed
to
draw
her
to
my
knee
hoping
she
would
weep
this
grief
away
as
she
had
often
done
a
lesser
sorrow
but
she
resisted
my
caress
and
standing
erect
before
me
checked
her
tears
saying
in
a
voice
still
trembling
with
resentment
and
reproach
you
promised
jean
to
be
kind
to
me
and
you
are
cruel
for
when
i
ask
for
love
you
give
me
jewels
books
or
flowers
as
you
would
give
a
pettish
child
a
toy
and
go
away
as
if
you
were
weary
of
me
oh
it
is
not
right
sir
and
i
can
not
no
i
will
not
bear
it
if
she
had
spared
reproaches
deserved
though
they
were
and
humbly
pleaded
to
be
loved
i
should
have
been
more
just
and
gentle
but
her
indignant
words
the
sharper
for
their
truth
roused
the
despotic
spirit
of
the
man
and
made
me
sternest
when
i
should
have
been
most
kind
effie
i
said
looking
coldly
up
into
her
troubled
face
i
have
given
you
the
right
to
be
thus
frank
with
me
but
before
you
exercise
that
right
let
me
tell
you
what
may
silence
your
reproaches
and
teach
you
to
know
me
better
i
desired
to
adopt
you
as
my
child
jean
would
not
consent
to
that
but
bid
me
marry
you
and
so
give
you
a
home
and
win
for
myself
a
companion
who
should
make
that
home
less
solitary
i
could
protect
you
in
no
other
way
and
i
married
you
i
meant
it
kindly
effie
for
i
pitied
you
ay
and
loved
you
too
as
i
hoped
i
had
fully
proved
you
have
sir
oh
you
have
but
i
hoped
i
might
in
time
be
more
to
you
than
a
dear
child
sighed
effie
while
softer
tears
flowed
as
she
spoke
effie
i
told
jean
i
was
a
hard
cold
man
and
i
was
one
as
those
words
passed
my
lips
i
told
her
i
was
unfitted
to
make
a
wife
happy
but
she
said
you
would
be
content
with
what
i
could
offer
and
so
i
gave
you
all
i
had
to
bestow
it
was
not
enough
yet
i
can
not
make
it
more
forgive
me
child
and
try
to
bear
your
disappointments
as
i
have
learned
to
bear
mine
effie
bent
suddenly
saying
with
a
look
of
anguish
do
you
regret
that
i
am
your
wife
sir
heaven
knows
i
do
for
i
can
not
make
you
happy
i
answered
mournfully
let
me
go
away
where
i
can
never
grieve
or
trouble
you
again
i
will
indeed
i
will
for
anything
is
easier
to
bear
than
this
oh
jean
why
did
you
leave
me
when
you
went
and
with
that
despairing
cry
effie
stretched
her
arms
into
the
empty
air
as
if
seeking
that
lost
friend
my
anger
melted
and
i
tried
to
soothe
her
saying
gently
as
i
laid
her
cheek
to
mine
my
child
death
alone
must
part
us
two
we
will
be
patient
with
each
other
and
so
may
learn
to
be
happy
yet
a
long
silence
fell
upon
us
both
my
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
thought
of
what
a
different
home
mine
might
have
been
if
agnes
had
been
true
and
effie
god
only
knows
how
sharp
a
conflict
passed
in
that
young
heart
i
could
not
guess
it
till
the
bitter
sequel
of
that
hour
came
a
timid
hand
upon
my
own
aroused
me
and
looking
down
i
met
such
an
altered
face
it
touched
me
like
a
mute
reproach
all
the
passion
bad
died
out
and
a
great
patience
seemed
to
have
arisen
there
it
looked
so
meek
and
wan
i
bent
and
kissed
it
but
no
smile
answered
me
as
effie
humbly
said
forgive
me
sir
and
tell
me
how
i
can
make
you
happier
for
i
am
truly
grateful
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
and
will
try
to
be
a
docile
child
to
you
be
happy
yourself
effie
and
i
shall
be
content
i
am
too
grave
and
old
to
be
a
fit
companion
for
you
dear
you
shall
have
gay
faces
and
young
friends
to
make
this
quiet
place
more
cheerful
i
should
have
thought
of
that
before
dance
sing
be
merry
effie
and
never
let
your
life
be
darkened
by
basil
ventnor
changeful
moods
and
you
she
whispered
looking
up
i
will
sit
among
my
books
or
seek
alone
the
few
friends
i
care
to
see
and
never
mar
your
gayety
with
my
gloomy
presence
dear
we
must
begin
at
once
to
go
our
separate
ways
for
with
so
many
years
between
us
we
can
never
find
the
same
paths
pleasant
very
long
let
me
be
a
father
to
you
and
a
friend
i
can
not
be
a
lover
child
effie
rose
and
went
silently
away
but
soon
came
again
wrapped
in
her
mantle
saying
as
she
looked
down
at
me
with
something
of
her
former
cheerfulness
i
am
good
now
come
and
row
me
down
the
river
it
is
too
beautiful
a
night
to
be
spent
in
tears
and
naughtiness
no
effie
you
shall
never
go
to
vaughan
again
if
you
dislike
her
so
no
friendship
of
mine
need
be
shared
by
you
if
it
gives
you
pain
nothing
shall
pain
me
any
more
she
answered
with
a
patient
sigh
i
will
be
your
merry
girl
again
and
try
to
love
agnes
for
your
sake
ah
do
come
or
i
shall
not
feel
forgiven
smiling
at
her
april
moods
i
obeyed
the
small
hands
clasped
about
my
own
and
through
the
fragrant
linden
walk
went
musing
to
the
silently
we
floated
down
and
at
the
lower
found
alfred
vaughan
just
mooring
his
own
boat
by
him
i
sent
a
message
to
his
sister
while
we
waited
for
her
at
the
shore
effie
stood
above
me
on
the
sloping
bank
and
as
agnes
entered
the
green
vista
of
the
flowery
path
she
turned
and
clung
to
me
with
sudden
fervor
kissed
me
passionately
and
then
stole
silently
into
the
boat
the
moonlight
turned
the
waves
to
silver
and
in
its
magic
rays
the
face
of
my
first
love
grew
young
again
she
sat
before
me
with
in
her
shining
hair
singing
as
she
sang
of
old
while
the
dash
of
falling
oars
kept
time
to
her
low
song
as
we
neared
the
ruined
bridge
whose
single
arch
still
cast
its
heavy
shadow
far
across
the
stream
agnes
bent
toward
me
softly
saying
basil
you
remember
this
how
could
i
forget
that
happy
night
long
years
ago
when
she
and
i
went
floating
down
the
same
bright
stream
two
happy
lovers
just
betrothed
as
she
spoke
it
all
came
back
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
i
forgot
the
silent
figure
sitting
there
behind
me
i
hope
agnes
had
forgotten
too
for
cruel
as
she
was
to
me
i
never
wished
to
think
her
hard
enough
to
hate
that
gentle
child
i
remember
agnes
i
said
with
a
regretful
sigh
my
voyage
has
been
a
lonely
one
since
then
are
you
not
happy
basil
she
asked
with
a
tender
pity
thrilling
her
low
voice
happy
i
echoed
bitterly
how
can
i
be
happy
remembering
what
might
have
been
agnes
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
silently
the
boat
shot
into
the
black
shadow
of
the
arch
a
sudden
eddy
seemed
to
sway
us
slightly
from
our
course
and
the
waves
dashed
sullenly
against
the
gloomy
walls
a
moment
more
and
we
glided
into
calmer
waters
and
unbroken
light
i
looked
up
from
my
task
to
speak
but
the
words
were
frozen
on
my
lips
by
a
cry
from
agnes
who
and
pale
seemed
pointing
to
some
phantom
which
i
could
not
see
i
turned
the
phantom
was
effie
empty
seat
the
shining
stream
grew
dark
before
me
and
a
great
pang
of
remorse
wrung
my
heart
as
that
sight
met
my
eyes
effie
i
cried
with
a
cry
that
rent
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
sent
the
name
ringing
down
the
river
but
nothing
answered
me
and
the
waves
rippled
softly
as
they
hurried
by
far
over
the
wide
stream
went
my
despairing
glance
and
saw
nothing
but
the
lilies
swaying
as
they
slept
and
the
black
arch
where
my
child
went
down
agnes
lay
trembling
at
my
feet
but
i
never
heeded
her
for
dead
voice
sounded
in
my
ear
demanding
the
life
confided
to
my
care
i
listened
benumbed
with
guilty
fear
and
as
if
summoned
by
that
weird
cry
there
came
a
white
flash
through
the
waves
and
effie
face
rose
up
before
me
pallid
and
wild
with
the
agony
of
that
swift
plunge
it
confronted
me
no
cry
for
help
parted
the
pale
lips
but
those
wide
eyes
were
luminous
with
a
love
whose
fire
that
deathful
river
could
not
quench
like
one
in
an
awful
dream
i
gazed
till
the
ripples
closed
above
it
one
instant
the
terror
held
me
the
next
i
was
far
down
in
those
waves
so
silver
fair
above
so
black
and
terrible
below
a
brief
blind
struggle
passed
before
i
grasped
a
tress
of
that
long
hair
then
an
arm
and
then
the
white
shape
with
a
clutch
like
death
as
the
dividing
waters
gave
us
to
the
light
again
agnes
flung
herself
far
over
the
and
drew
my
lifeless
burden
in
i
followed
and
we
laid
it
down
a
piteous
sight
for
human
eyes
to
look
upon
of
that
swift
voyage
home
i
can
remember
nothing
but
the
still
face
on
agnes
breast
the
sight
of
which
nerved
my
dizzy
brain
and
made
my
muscles
iron
for
many
weeks
there
was
a
darkened
chamber
in
my
house
and
anxious
figures
gliding
to
and
fro
wan
with
long
vigils
and
the
fear
of
death
i
often
crept
in
to
look
upon
the
little
figure
lying
there
to
watch
the
feverish
roses
blooming
on
the
wasted
cheek
the
fitful
fire
burning
in
the
unconscious
eyes
to
hear
the
broken
words
so
full
of
pathos
to
my
ear
and
then
to
steal
away
and
struggle
to
forget
my
bird
fluttered
on
the
threshold
of
its
cage
but
love
lured
it
back
for
its
gentle
mission
was
not
yet
fulfilled
the
effie
lay
dead
beneath
the
ripples
of
the
river
but
the
rose
up
from
that
bed
of
suffering
like
one
consecrated
to
life
high
duties
by
the
bitter
baptism
of
that
dark
hour
slender
and
pale
with
serious
eyes
and
quiet
steps
she
moved
through
the
home
which
once
echoed
to
the
glad
voice
and
dancing
feet
of
that
vanished
shape
a
sweet
sobriety
shaded
her
young
face
and
a
meek
smile
sat
upon
her
lips
but
the
old
blithesomeness
was
gone
she
never
claimed
her
childish
place
upon
my
knee
never
tried
the
winsome
wiles
that
used
to
chase
away
my
gloom
never
came
to
pour
her
innocent
delights
and
griefs
into
my
ear
or
bless
me
with
the
frank
affection
which
grew
very
precious
when
i
found
it
lost
docile
as
ever
and
eager
to
gratify
my
lightest
wish
she
left
no
wifely
duty
unfulfilled
always
near
me
if
i
breathed
her
name
but
vanishing
when
i
grew
silent
as
if
her
task
were
done
always
smiling
a
cheerful
farewell
when
i
went
a
quiet
welcome
when
i
came
i
missed
the
april
face
that
once
watched
me
go
the
warm
embrace
that
greeted
me
again
and
at
my
heart
the
sense
of
loss
grew
daily
deeper
as
i
felt
the
growing
change
effie
remembered
the
words
i
had
spoken
on
that
mournful
night
remembered
that
our
paths
must
lie
apart
that
her
husband
was
a
friend
and
nothing
more
she
treasured
every
careless
hint
i
had
given
and
followed
it
most
faithfully
she
gathered
gay
young
friends
about
her
went
out
into
the
brilliant
world
and
i
believed
she
was
content
if
i
had
ever
felt
she
was
a
burden
to
the
selfish
freedom
i
desired
i
was
punished
now
for
i
had
lost
a
blessing
which
no
common
pleasure
could
replace
i
sat
alone
and
no
blithe
voice
made
music
in
the
silence
of
my
room
no
bright
locks
swept
my
shoulder
and
no
soft
caress
assured
me
that
i
was
beloved
i
looked
for
my
household
sprite
in
girlish
garb
with
its
free
hair
and
sunny
eyes
but
found
only
a
fair
woman
graceful
in
rich
attire
crowned
with
my
gifts
and
standing
afar
off
among
her
blooming
peers
i
could
not
guess
the
solitude
of
that
true
heart
nor
see
the
captive
spirit
gazing
at
me
from
those
steadfast
eyes
no
word
of
the
cause
of
that
despairing
deed
passed
effie
lips
and
i
had
no
need
to
ask
it
agnes
was
silent
and
soon
left
us
but
her
brother
was
a
frequent
guest
effie
liked
his
gay
companionship
and
i
denied
her
nothing
nothing
but
the
one
desire
of
her
life
so
that
first
year
passed
and
though
the
ease
and
liberty
i
coveted
were
undisturbed
i
was
not
satisfied
solitude
grew
irksome
and
study
ceased
to
charm
i
tried
old
pleasures
but
they
had
lost
their
zest
renewed
old
friendships
but
they
wearied
me
i
forgot
agnes
and
ceased
to
think
her
fair
i
looked
at
effie
and
sighed
for
my
lost
youth
my
little
wife
grew
very
beautiful
to
me
for
she
was
blooming
fast
into
a
gracious
womanhood
i
felt
a
secret
pride
in
knowing
she
was
mine
and
watched
her
as
i
fancied
a
fond
brother
might
glad
that
she
was
so
good
so
fair
so
much
beloved
i
ceased
to
mourn
the
plaything
i
had
lost
and
something
akin
to
reverence
mingled
with
the
deepening
admiration
of
the
man
gay
guests
had
filled
the
house
with
festal
light
and
sound
one
night
and
when
the
last
bright
figure
had
vanished
from
the
threshold
of
the
door
i
still
stood
there
looking
over
the
lawn
hoping
to
cool
the
fever
of
my
blood
and
case
the
restless
pain
that
haunted
me
i
shut
out
the
keen
air
and
wintry
sky
at
length
and
silently
ascended
to
the
diverted
rooms
above
but
in
the
soft
gloom
of
a
vestibule
my
steps
were
stayed
two
figures
in
a
flowery
alcove
fixed
my
eye
the
light
streamed
full
upon
them
and
the
fragrant
stillness
of
the
air
was
hardly
stirred
by
their
low
tones
effie
was
there
sunk
on
a
low
couch
her
face
bowed
upon
her
hands
and
at
her
side
speaking
with
impassioned
voice
and
ardent
eyes
leaned
alfred
vaughan
the
sight
struck
me
like
a
blow
and
the
sharp
anguish
of
that
moment
proved
how
deeply
i
had
learned
to
love
effie
it
is
a
sinful
tie
that
binds
you
to
that
man
he
does
not
love
you
and
it
should
be
broken
for
this
slavery
will
wear
away
the
life
now
grown
so
dear
to
me
the
words
hot
with
indignant
passion
smote
me
like
a
wintry
blast
but
not
so
coldly
as
the
broken
voice
that
answered
them
he
said
death
alone
must
part
us
two
and
remembering
that
i
can
not
listen
to
another
love
like
a
guilty
ghost
i
stole
away
and
in
the
darkness
of
my
solitary
room
struggled
with
my
bitter
grief
my
newborn
love
i
never
blamed
my
wife
that
wife
who
had
heard
the
tender
name
so
seldom
she
could
scarce
feel
it
hers
i
had
fettered
her
free
heart
forgetting
it
would
one
day
cease
to
be
a
child
i
bade
her
look
upon
me
as
a
father
she
had
learned
the
lesson
well
and
now
what
right
had
i
to
reproach
her
for
listening
to
a
lover
voice
when
her
husband
was
so
cold
what
mattered
it
that
slowly
almost
unconsciously
i
had
learned
to
love
her
with
the
passion
of
a
youth
the
power
of
a
man
i
had
alienated
that
fond
nature
from
my
own
and
now
it
was
too
late
heaven
only
knows
the
bitterness
of
that
hour
i
can
not
tell
it
but
through
the
darkness
of
my
anguish
and
remorse
that
newly
kindled
love
burned
like
a
blessed
fire
and
while
it
tortured
purified
by
its
light
i
saw
the
error
of
my
life
was
written
on
the
actions
of
the
past
and
i
knew
that
my
punishment
was
very
just
with
a
repentant
tears
i
confessed
it
to
my
father
and
he
solaced
me
showed
me
the
path
to
tread
and
made
me
nobler
for
the
blessedness
and
pain
of
that
still
hour
dawn
found
me
an
altered
man
for
in
natures
like
mine
the
rain
of
a
great
sorrow
melts
the
ice
of
years
and
their
hidden
strength
blooms
in
a
late
harvest
of
patience
and
humility
i
resolved
to
break
the
tie
which
bound
poor
effie
to
a
joyless
fate
and
gratitude
for
a
selfish
deed
which
wore
the
guise
of
charity
should
no
longer
mar
her
peace
i
would
atone
for
the
wrong
i
had
done
her
the
suffering
she
had
endured
and
she
should
never
know
that
i
had
guessed
her
tender
secret
nor
learn
the
love
which
made
my
sacrifice
so
bitter
yet
so
just
alfred
came
no
more
and
as
i
watched
the
growing
pallor
of
her
cheek
her
patient
efforts
to
be
cheerful
and
serene
i
honored
that
meek
creature
for
her
constancy
to
what
she
deemed
the
duty
of
her
life
i
did
not
tell
her
my
resolve
at
once
for
i
could
not
give
her
up
so
soon
it
was
a
weak
delay
but
i
had
not
learned
the
beauty
of
a
perfect
and
though
i
clung
to
my
purpose
steadfastly
my
heart
still
cherished
a
desperate
hope
that
i
might
be
spared
this
loss
in
the
midst
of
this
secret
conflict
there
came
a
letter
from
old
adam
lyndsay
asking
to
see
his
daughter
child
for
life
was
waning
slowly
and
he
desired
to
forgive
as
he
hoped
to
be
forgiven
when
the
last
hour
came
the
letter
was
to
me
and
as
i
read
it
i
saw
a
way
i
might
be
spared
the
hard
task
of
telling
effie
she
was
to
be
free
i
feared
my
strength
would
desert
me
and
my
courage
fail
when
looking
on
the
woman
who
was
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
i
tried
to
give
her
back
the
liberty
whose
worth
she
had
learned
to
know
effie
should
go
and
i
would
write
the
words
i
dared
not
speak
she
would
be
in
her
mother
home
free
to
show
her
joy
at
her
release
and
smile
upon
the
lover
she
had
banished
i
went
to
tell
her
for
it
was
i
who
sought
her
now
who
watched
for
her
coming
and
sighed
at
her
departing
steps
i
who
waited
for
her
smile
and
followed
her
with
wistful
eyes
the
child
slighted
affection
was
atoned
for
now
by
my
unseen
devotion
to
the
woman
i
gave
the
letter
and
she
read
it
silently
will
you
go
love
i
asked
as
she
folded
it
yes
the
old
man
has
no
one
to
care
for
him
but
me
and
it
is
so
beautiful
to
be
loved
a
sudden
smile
touched
her
lips
and
a
soft
dew
shone
in
the
shadowy
eyes
which
seemed
looking
into
other
and
tenderer
ones
than
mine
she
could
not
know
how
sadly
i
echoed
those
words
nor
how
i
longed
to
tell
her
of
another
man
who
sighed
to
be
forgiven
you
must
gather
roses
for
these
pale
cheeks
among
the
breezy
moorlands
dear
they
are
not
so
blooming
as
they
were
a
year
ago
jean
would
reproach
me
for
my
want
of
care
i
said
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
though
each
word
seemed
a
farewell
poor
jean
how
long
it
seems
since
she
kissed
them
last
sighed
effie
musing
sadly
as
she
turned
her
my
heart
ached
to
see
how
thin
the
hand
had
grown
and
how
easily
that
little
fetter
would
fall
off
when
i
set
my
captive
lark
at
liberty
i
looked
till
i
dared
look
no
longer
and
then
rose
saying
you
will
write
often
effie
for
i
shall
miss
you
very
much
she
cast
a
quick
look
into
my
face
asking
hurriedly
am
i
to
go
alone
dear
i
have
much
to
do
and
can
not
go
but
you
need
fear
nothing
i
shall
send
ralph
and
mrs
prior
with
you
and
the
journey
is
soon
over
when
will
you
go
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
left
me
since
i
took
her
from
jean
arms
and
i
longed
to
keep
her
always
near
me
but
remembering
the
task
i
had
to
do
i
felt
that
i
must
seem
cold
till
she
knew
all
soon
very
soon
let
me
go
sir
i
long
to
be
away
she
cried
some
swift
emotion
banishing
the
calmness
of
her
usual
manner
as
she
rose
with
eager
eyes
and
a
gesture
full
of
longing
you
shall
go
effie
was
all
i
could
say
and
with
no
word
of
thanks
she
hastened
away
leaving
me
so
calm
without
so
desolate
within
the
same
eagerness
possessed
her
all
that
day
and
the
next
she
went
away
clinging
to
me
at
the
last
as
she
had
clung
that
night
upon
the
as
if
her
grateful
heart
reproached
her
for
the
joy
she
felt
at
leaving
my
unhappy
home
a
few
days
passed
bringing
me
the
comfort
of
a
few
sweet
lines
from
effie
signed
your
child
that
sight
reminded
me
that
if
i
would
do
an
honest
deed
it
should
be
generously
done
i
read
again
the
little
missive
she
had
sent
and
then
i
wrote
the
letter
which
might
be
my
last
with
no
hint
of
my
love
beyond
the
expression
of
sincerest
regard
and
interest
in
her
happiness
no
hint
of
alfred
vaughan
for
i
would
not
wound
her
pride
nor
let
her
dream
that
any
eye
had
seen
the
passion
she
so
silently
surrendered
with
no
reproach
to
me
and
no
shadow
on
the
name
i
had
given
into
her
keeping
heaven
knows
what
it
cost
me
and
heaven
through
the
suffering
of
that
hour
granted
me
an
humbler
spirit
and
a
better
life
it
went
and
i
waited
for
my
fate
as
one
might
wait
for
pardon
or
for
doom
it
came
at
length
a
short
sad
letter
full
of
meek
obedience
to
my
will
of
penitence
for
faults
i
never
knew
and
grateful
prayers
for
my
peace
my
last
hope
died
then
and
for
many
days
i
dwelt
alone
living
over
all
that
happy
year
with
painful
vividness
i
dreamed
again
of
those
fair
days
and
woke
to
curse
the
selfish
blindness
which
had
hidden
my
best
blessing
from
me
till
it
was
forever
lost
how
long
i
should
have
mourned
thus
unavailingly
i
can
not
tell
a
more
sudden
but
far
less
grievous
loss
befell
me
my
fortune
was
nearly
swept
away
in
the
general
ruin
of
a
most
disastrous
year
this
event
roused
me
from
my
despair
and
made
me
strong
again
for
i
must
hoard
what
could
be
saved
for
effie
sake
she
had
known
a
cruel
want
with
me
and
she
must
never
know
another
while
she
bore
my
name
i
looked
my
misfortune
in
the
face
and
ceased
to
feel
it
one
for
the
diminished
fortune
was
still
ample
for
my
darling
dower
and
now
what
need
had
i
of
any
but
the
simplest
home
before
another
month
was
gone
i
was
in
the
quiet
place
henceforth
to
be
mine
alone
and
nothing
now
remained
for
me
to
do
but
to
dissolve
the
bond
that
made
my
effie
mine
sitting
over
the
dim
embers
of
my
solitary
hearth
i
thought
of
this
and
looking
round
the
silent
room
whose
only
ornaments
were
the
things
made
sacred
by
her
use
the
utter
desolation
struck
so
heavily
upon
my
heart
that
i
bowed
my
head
upon
my
folded
arms
and
yielded
to
the
tender
longing
that
could
not
be
repressed
the
bitter
paroxysm
passed
and
raising
my
eyes
the
clearer
for
that
stormy
rain
i
beheld
effie
standing
like
an
answer
to
my
spirit
cry
with
a
great
start
i
regarded
her
saying
at
length
in
a
voice
that
sounded
cold
for
my
heart
leaped
up
to
meet
her
and
yet
must
not
speak
effie
why
are
you
here
and
pale
she
stood
before
me
with
no
sign
of
emotion
but
the
slight
tremor
of
her
frame
and
answered
my
greeting
with
a
sad
humility
i
came
because
i
promised
to
cleave
to
you
through
health
and
sickness
poverty
and
wealth
and
i
must
keep
that
vow
till
you
absolve
me
from
it
forgive
me
but
i
knew
misfortune
had
befallen
you
and
remembering
all
you
had
done
for
me
came
hoping
i
might
comfort
when
other
friends
deserted
you
grateful
to
the
last
i
sighed
low
to
myself
and
though
deeply
touched
replied
with
the
calmness
that
made
my
speech
so
brief
you
owe
me
nothing
effie
and
i
most
earnestly
desired
to
spare
you
this
some
sudden
hope
seemed
born
of
my
regretful
words
for
with
an
eager
glance
she
cried
was
it
that
desire
which
prompted
you
to
part
from
me
did
you
think
i
should
shrink
from
sharing
poverty
with
you
who
gave
me
all
i
own
no
dear
ah
no
i
said
i
knew
your
grateful
spirit
far
too
well
for
that
it
was
because
i
could
not
make
your
happiness
and
yet
had
robbed
you
of
the
right
to
seek
it
with
some
younger
and
some
better
man
basil
what
man
tell
me
for
no
doubt
shall
stand
between
us
now
she
grasped
my
arm
and
her
rapid
words
were
a
command
i
only
answered
alfred
vaughan
effie
covered
up
her
face
crying
as
she
sank
down
at
my
feet
oh
my
fear
my
fear
why
was
i
blind
so
long
i
felt
her
grief
to
my
heart
core
for
my
own
anguish
made
me
pitiful
and
my
love
made
me
strong
i
lifted
up
that
drooping
head
and
laid
it
down
where
it
might
never
rest
again
saying
gently
cheerily
and
with
a
most
sincere
forgetfulness
of
self
my
wife
i
never
cherished
a
harsh
thought
of
you
never
uttered
a
reproach
when
your
affections
turned
from
a
cold
neglectful
guardian
to
find
a
tenderer
i
saw
your
struggles
dear
your
patient
grief
your
silent
sacrifice
and
honored
you
more
truly
than
i
can
tell
effie
i
robbed
you
of
your
liberty
but
i
will
restore
it
making
such
poor
reparation
as
i
can
for
this
long
year
of
pain
and
when
i
see
you
blest
in
a
happier
home
my
keen
remorse
will
be
appeased
as
i
ceased
effie
rose
erect
and
stood
before
me
transformed
from
a
timid
girl
into
an
earnest
woman
some
dormant
power
and
passion
woke
she
turned
on
me
a
countenance
aglow
with
feeling
soul
in
the
eye
heart
on
the
lips
and
in
her
voice
an
energy
that
held
me
mute
i
feared
to
speak
before
she
said
but
now
i
dare
anything
for
i
have
heard
you
call
me
and
seen
that
in
your
face
which
gives
me
hope
basil
the
grief
you
saw
was
not
for
the
loss
of
any
love
but
yours
the
conflict
you
beheld
was
the
daily
struggle
to
subdue
my
longing
spirit
to
your
will
and
the
sacrifice
you
honor
but
the
renunciation
of
all
hope
i
stood
between
you
and
the
woman
whom
you
loved
and
asked
of
death
to
free
me
from
that
cruel
lot
you
gave
me
back
my
life
but
you
withheld
the
gift
that
made
it
worth
possessing
you
desired
to
be
freed
from
the
affection
which
only
wearied
you
and
i
tried
to
conquer
it
but
it
would
not
die
let
me
speak
now
and
then
i
will
be
still
forever
must
our
ways
lie
apart
can
i
never
be
more
to
you
than
now
oh
basil
oh
my
husband
i
have
loved
you
very
truly
from
the
first
shall
i
never
know
the
blessedness
of
a
return
words
could
not
answer
that
appeal
i
gathered
my
life
happiness
close
to
my
breast
and
in
the
silence
of
a
full
heart
felt
that
god
was
very
good
to
me
soon
all
my
pain
and
passion
were
confessed
fast
and
fervently
the
tale
was
told
and
as
the
truth
dawned
on
that
patient
wife
a
tender
peace
transfigured
her
uplifted
countenance
until
to
me
it
seemed
an
face
i
am
a
poor
man
now
i
said
still
holding
that
frail
creature
fast
fearing
to
see
her
vanish
as
her
semblance
had
so
often
done
in
the
long
vigils
i
had
kept
a
poor
man
effie
and
yet
very
rich
for
i
have
my
treasure
back
again
but
i
am
wiser
than
when
we
parted
for
i
have
learned
that
love
is
better
than
a
world
of
wealth
and
victory
over
self
a
nobler
conquest
than
a
continent
dear
i
have
no
home
but
this
can
you
be
happy
here
with
no
fortune
but
the
little
store
set
apart
for
you
and
the
knowledge
that
no
want
shall
touch
you
while
i
live
and
as
i
spoke
i
sighed
remembering
all
i
might
have
done
and
dreading
poverty
for
her
alone
but
with
a
gesture
soft
yet
solemn
effie
laid
her
hands
upon
my
head
as
if
endowing
me
with
blessing
and
with
gift
and
answered
with
her
steadfast
eyes
on
mine
you
gave
me
your
home
when
i
was
homeless
let
me
give
it
back
and
with
it
a
proud
wife
i
too
am
rich
for
that
old
man
is
gone
and
left
me
all
take
it
basil
and
give
me
a
little
love
i
gave
not
little
but
a
long
life
of
devotion
for
the
good
gift
god
had
bestowed
on
me
finding
in
it
a
household
spirit
the
daily
benediction
of
whose
presence
banished
sorrow
selfishness
and
gloom
and
through
the
influence
of
happy
human
love
led
me
to
a
truer
faith
in
the
divine
to
the
muse
whither
albeit
i
follow
fast
in
all
life
circuit
i
but
find
not
where
thou
art
but
where
thou
wast
fleet
beckoner
more
shy
than
wind
i
haunt
the
solitudes
with
soft
brown
silence
carpeted
and
think
to
snare
thee
in
the
woods
peace
i
but
thou
art
fled
i
find
the
rock
where
thou
didst
rest
the
moss
thy
skimming
foot
hath
prest
all
nature
with
thy
parting
thrills
like
branches
after
birds
thy
passage
hill
and
hollow
fills
with
hints
of
virtue
not
their
own
in
dimples
still

deepest

its

and

the
earliest
conception
of
an
auxiliary
motive
power
in
navigation
is
contemporaneous
with
the
first
use
of
the
wind
the
name
of
the
inventor
unrecorded
in
the
is
lost
in
the
lapse
of
ages
the
first
motor
was
undoubtedly
the
hand
next
followed
the
paddle
the
scull
and
the
oar
sails
were
an
introduced
to
play
the
secondary
part
of
an
auxiliary
scarce
was
man
in
possession
of
this
means
of
the
wind
and
resting
his
weary
oar
than
scorning
longer
confinement
to
the
coast
he
boldly
ventured
upon
the
conquest
of
the
main
under
the
same
impulse
the
tiny
skiff
in
which
he
hardly
dared
to
quit
the
bank
was
enlarged
and
made
fit
companion
of
his
distant
emprise
these
footprints
of
the
infant
steps
of
navigation
may
all
still
be
traced
among
the
maritime
tribes
of
the
pacific
from
that
period
sails
became
the
chief
motor
and
the
paddle
and
the
sweep
auxiliaries
which
position
they
still
hold
to
some
extent
even
in
vessels
of
considerable
burden
but
as
the
proportions
of
naval
architecture
enlarged
these
puny
instruments
were
thrown
aside
although
the
importance
and
necessity
of
some
such
auxiliary
in
the
ordinary
exigencies
of
marine
life
have
always
been
felt
and
it
has
long
been
earnestly
sought
from
the
first
successful
application
of
steam
to
navigation
by
fulton
in
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
provide
ships
with
an
auxiliary
motor
but
the
result
has
shown
the
fallacy
of
this
conception
for
more
than
twenty
years
has
advanced
with
giant
strides
overstepping
several
times
the
limits
which
science
had
assigned
it
but
the
by
which
the
agency
of
steam
has
been
applied
forms
so
bad
an
alliance
with
canvas
and
supplies
so
indifferently
the
requirements
of
a
that
it
has
been
impossible
by
this
intermediary
to
render
steam
the
efficient
coadjutor
of
sails
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
steam
so
speedily
took
rank
as
a
primary
motor
upon
the
ocean
for
in
all
the
successful
marine
applications
of
steam
by
means
of
the
paddle
steam
is
the
dominant
power
and
sails
the
accessory
or
almost
superfluous
auxiliary
it
is
the
screw
alone
in
some
of
its
modifications
which
offers
the
means
of
a
successful
and
economical
adaptation
of
steam
to
ships
of
war
or
of
commerce
for
it
is
susceptible
of
a
more
complete
protection
than
the
paddle
and
of
an
easy
and
advantageous
combination
with
canvas
the
in
fact
has
assumed
so
important
a
part
in
all
naval
enterprise
that
it
may
not
be
without
interest
to
trace
briefly
its
rise
and
progress
to
the
consideration
it
now
commands
and
to
review
in
general
terms
the
various
experiments
by
which
the
has
been
brought
to
its
present
high
state
of
efficiency
excelling
for
purposes
of
war
all
other
kinds
of
vessels
as
early
as
john
stevens
of
hoboken
new
jersey
engaged
in
experiments
to
devise
some
means
of
driving
a
vessel
through
the
water
by
applying
the
motive
power
at
the
stern
and
with
a
and
a
defective
boiler
attained
for
short
distances
a
speed
of
seven
knots
and
it
is
surprising
that
with
the
genius
and
determination
so
characteristic
of
his
race
he
should
have
abandoned
the
path
on
which
he
appears
to
have
so
fairly
entered
within
the
last
numerous
attempts
of
a
similar
character
have
been
made
in
europe
and
america
but
although
many
of
the
contrivances
for
this
purpose
were
exceedingly
ingenious
and
the
success
of
some
of
the
experiments
sufficient
one
would
suppose
to
excite
the
interest
of
the
public
and
encourage
perseverance
in
the
undertaking
yet
in
no
instance
were
they
followed
by
any
practical
and
useful
results
until
the
year
when
both
captain
ericsson
and
smith
so
fully
demonstrated
the
speed
and
safety
with
which
vessels
could
be
moved
by
the
as
to
convince
every
intelligent
and
unprejudiced
mind
of
the
importance
of
their
inventions
and
immediately
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
principal
naval
powers
of
the
world
captain
ericsson
is
a
native
of
sweden
but
for
some
years
previous
to
he
had
resided
in
england
where
he
had
become
known
as
an
engineer
and
mechanician
of
distinguished
ability
in
july
he
took
out
a
patent
in
england
for
his
method
of
propelling
vessels
and
during
that
year
the
results
of
his
experiments
with
a
small
boat
were
so
satisfactory
that
in
the
following
year
he
built
a
vessel
feet
long
with
eight
feet
beam
and
drawing
three
feet
of
water
called
the
francis
ogden
in
compliment
to
the
gentleman
then
consul
of
the
united
states
at
liverpool
who
was
the
first
person
to
appreciate
the
merits
of
his
invention
and
to
encourage
him
in
his
efforts
to
perfect
it
this
vessel
was
tried
upon
the
thames
in
april
and
succeeded
admirably
she
made
ten
knots
an
hour
and
towed
the
american
ship
toronto
at
the
rate
of
four
and
a
half
knots
an
hour
and
in
the
following
summer
sir
charles
adam
one
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
sir
william
symonds
the
surveyor
of
the
navy
and
several
other
scientific
gentlemen
and
officers
of
rank
were
towed
by
her
in
the
admiralty
barge
at
the
speed
of
ten
miles
an
hour
notwithstanding
this
demonstration
of
the
powers
of
his
vessel
captain
ericsson
did
not
succeed
in
exciting
the
interest
of
any
of
the
persons
who
witnessed
the
performance
and
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
no
one
of
them
had
the
intelligence
to
perceive
or
the
magnanimity
to
admit
the
importance
of
his
invention
but
fortunately
for
ericsson
and
the
reputation
of
our
country
he
soon
after
met
with
captain
stockton
of
the
united
states
navy
who
at
once
took
the
deepest
interest
in
his
plans
the
result
of
one
experiment
with
ericsson
steamer
was
sufficient
to
convince
a
man
of
stockton
sagacity
of
the
immense
advantages
which
the
new
motor
might
confer
upon
the
commerce
and
upon
the
navy
of
his
country
and
forthwith
he
ordered
an
iron
steamer
to
be
built
and
fitted
with
ericsson
propeller
this
vessel
was
named
the
stockton
and
was
launched
in
july
and
after
being
thoroughly
tested
and
her
success
demonstrated
she
was
sent
under
sail
to
the
united
states
in
april
of
the
next
year
and
was
soon
after
followed
by
captain
ericsson
when
in
consequence
of
the
representations
of
captain
stockton
the
government
ordered
the
princeton
to
be
built
under
ericsson
superintendence
and
to
be
fitted
with
his
propeller
the
princeton
of
tons
was
launched
in
april
and
her
propeller
of
six
blades
of
feet
pitch
and
of
fourteen
feet
diameter
was
driven
by
a
engine
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
all
her
machinery
placed
the
her
was
so
arranged
that
the
upper
parts
could
be
let
into
the
lower
so
as
not
to
be
visible
above
the
rail
and
as
the
anthracite
coal
which
she
used
evolved
no
smoke
she
could
not
at
a
short
distance
be
distinguished
from
a
her
best
speed
under
steam
alone
was
and
under
sail
alone
knots
her
mean
performance
under
steam
and
sail
and
considering
the
imperfect
form
of
boiler
employed
and
the
small
amount
of
fuel
consumed
it
may
be
doubted
if
this
has
since
been
much
excelled
she
worked
and
steered
well
under
canvas
or
steam
alone
or
under
both
combined
was
dry
and
weatherly
but
pitched
heavily
and
was
rather
deficient
in
stability
footnote
for
a
particular
account
of
the
princeton
by
isherwood
see
of
the
franklin
for
june
taking
everything
into
consideration
the
princeton
was
a
most
successful
experiment
and
in
her
day
the
most
efficient
of
her
class
by
her
construction
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
placed
itself
far
in
advance
of
all
the
world
in
the
path
of
naval
improvement
and
it
is
deeply
to
be
regretted
that
it
did
not
avail
itself
of
the
advantage
thus
gained
that
it
did
not
immediately
order
the
construction
of
other
vessels
in
which
successively
the
few
defects
of
the
princeton
might
have
been
corrected
that
it
did
not
persist
in
that
path
of
improvement
into
which
it
had
fortunately
been
directed
instead
of
suffering
our
great
naval
rivals
to
outstrip
us
in
the
race
and
compel
us
at
last
to
resort
to
them
for
instruction
in
that
science
the
very
rudiments
of
which
they
had
learned
from
us
the
success
of
the
princeton
was
followed
by
the
general
adoption
in
america
of
the
when
ericsson
left
england
he
confided
his
interests
to
count
rosen
who
in
placed
an
ericsson
propeller
in
the
french
frigate
pomone
and
soon
afterwards
the
british
admiralty
determined
to
place
it
in
the
amphion
not
only
was
the
performance
of
these
vessels
highly
satisfactory
but
they
were
the
first
ships
in
the
navies
of
europe
in
which
the
great
desideratum
was
secured
of
placing
the
machinery
below
the
ericsson
propeller
having
been
the
first
introduced
into
france
it
was
generally
adopted
but
afterwards
in
consequence
of
the
accounts
of
smith
screw
received
from
england
it
underwent
various
modifications
such
was
the
result
of
ericsson
labors
it
now
remains
to
relate
the
success
of
smith
the
efforts
of
either
had
been
sufficient
to
have
secured
to
navigation
the
inestimable
advantages
of
but
their
rivalry
probably
hastened
the
solution
of
the
problem
in
may
smith
a
farmer
of
hendon
in
england
took
out
a
patent
for
his
and
exhibited
some
experiments
with
it
attached
to
a
model
boat
and
in
the
following
autumn
built
a
boat
of
six
tons
burden
of
ten
and
fitted
with
a
wooden
screw
this
vessel
was
kept
running
upon
the
thames
for
nearly
a
year
and
her
performance
was
so
satisfactory
that
smith
determined
to
try
her
qualities
at
sea
and
in
the
course
of
the
year
he
visited
in
her
several
ports
on
the
coast
of
england
and
proved
that
she
worked
well
in
strong
winds
and
rough
water
these
trials
attracted
much
attention
and
at
last
awakened
the
interest
of
the
admiralty
who
requested
smith
to
try
his
propeller
on
a
larger
vessel
and
the
archimedes
of
ninety
and
tons
built
for
this
purpose
was
launched
in
october
and
made
her
experimental
trip
in
it
was
thought
that
her
performance
would
be
satisfactory
if
she
could
make
four
or
five
knots
an
hour
but
she
made
nearly
ten
in
may
she
went
from
gravesend
to
portsmouth
a
distance
of
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
and
made
the
run
in
twenty
hours
in
april
captain
chappel
and
lloyd
chief
engineer
of
woolwich
dockyard
were
appointed
by
the
admiralty
to
try
a
series
of
experiments
with
her
at
dover
the
numerous
trials
made
under
the
superintendence
of
these
officers
fully
proved
the
efficiency
of
the
new
propeller
and
their
report
was
entirely
favorable
the
archimedes

circumnavigated

under

the
principal
ports
she
afterwards
went
to
oporto
antwerp
and
other
places
and
everywhere
excited
the
admiration
of
engineers
and
seamen
up
to
this
period
the
british
engineers
were
nearly
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
the
use
of
the
screw
involved
a
great
loss
of
power
and
they
had
concluded
that
it
could
not
be
adopted
but
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
resist
the
impressions
made
on
the
public
by
the
demonstration
which
had
been
given
both
by
smith
and
ericsson
and
although
the
engineers
were
still
unwilling
to
admit
the
screw
to
a
comparison
with
the
paddle
it
was
evident
that
their
first
conclusions
regarding
it
were
erroneous
and
thereafter
it
was
viewed
by
them
with
less
disdain
and
spoken
of
more
hopefully
one
of
the
great
objections
by
engineers
to
the
use
of
the
screw
was
their
inability
at
the
time
of
its
introduction
to
construct
properly
a
screw
engine
that
is
to
say
a
horizontal
engine
working
at
a
speed
of
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
revolutions
per
minute
all
their
experience
having
been
in
engines
working
from
ten
to
fifteen
revolutions
per
minute
the
peculiar
mechanical
details
required
in
the
screw
engine
the
necessity
for
accurate
counterbalancing
were
then
unknown
and
had
to
be
learned
from
a
long
succession
of
expensive
failures
in
england
the
first
machines
applied
to
the
screw
were
engines
working
it
by
gearing
there
were
consequently
lost
all
the
advantages
of
the
reduced
cost
bulk
and
weight
of
the
screw
engine
proper
including
for
war
purposes
the
important
feature
of
its
being
placed
below
the
at
first
the
screw
had
not
only
to
contend
with
physical
difficulties
but
to
struggle
against
nearly
universal
prejudice
many
inventors
had
succumbed
to
these
obstacles
and
therefore
too
much
applause
can
not
be
bestowed
upon
those
who
unsustained
by
public
sympathy
and
in
defiance
of
a
prevailing
skepticism
maintained
their
faith
and
courage
unshaken
and
gallantly
persisted
in
their
efforts
until
crowned
with
a
success
ericsson
before
interesting
himself
with
the
screw
was
as
has
been
seen
an
engineer
and
mechanician
of
distinguished
ability
whereas
smith
in
commencing
his
new
vocation
had
all
to
acquire
but
his
first
conception
ericsson
could
rely
upon
the
fertility
of
his
own
genius
was
his
own
draughtsman
and
designed
his
own
engines
accommodating
them
to
the
new
propeller
by
dispensing
with
gearing
and
adapting
them
to
a
speed
of
from
thirty
to
forty
revolutions
a
great
and
bold
advance
for
an
initiative
step
smith
on
the
contrary
not
being
an
engineer
had
to
intrust
the
execution
of
his
plans
to
others
whose
knowledge
of
construction
was
in
the
routine
of
engines
and
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
all
the
earliest
british
were
driven
by
gearing
this
want
of
mechanical
resources
on
the
part
of
smith
added
to
the
difficulties
of
his
career
but
his
resolution
and
perseverance
rose
superior
to
all
obstacles
and
carried
him
to
the
goal
in
triumph
briefly
then
these
were
the
respective
merits
of
smith
and
ericsson
in
the
introduction
of
and
it
is
much
to
their
honor
that
throughout
their
career
no
jealousies
dimmed
the
lustre
of
a
noble
rivalry
such
was
the
origin
of
the
new
motor
the
mighty
engine
by
which
armadas
are
marshalled
in
the
burdens
of
commerce
borne
to
distant
marts
the
impatient
emigrant
transferred
to
the
promised
land
and
by
which
the
breathings
of
affection
the
pangs
of
distress
and
the
sighs
of
love
are
wafted
to
continents
in
consequence
of
the
success
of
the
archimedes
the
admiralty
ordered
the
rattler
to
be
fitted
with
a
screw
and
it
was
no
small
satisfaction
to
find
that
her
engines
could
be
easily
adapted
to
the
new
propeller
she
is
of
tons
and
two
hundred
and
was
launched
in
the
spring
of
being
the
first
in
the
british
navy
in
the
course
of
the
two
succeeding
years
she
was
tried
with
a
great
many
different
screws
and
numerous
experiments
were
made
to
discover
the
length
diameter
pitch
and
number
of
blades
of
the
screw
most
effective
in
all
the
various
conditions
of
wind
and
sea
a
screw
of
two
blades
each
equal
to
part
of
a
convolution
and
of
a
uniform
pitch
was
on
the
whole
found
to
be
the
most
efficient
and
this
is
the
screw
now
adopted
in
most
of
the
ships
of
all
classes
in
the
british
navy
a
propeller
of
very
different
construction
which
had
given
great
results
in
a
ship
of
the
peninsular
and
oriental
steamship
company
and
was
afterwards
exhibited
in
the
docks
at
southampton
here
claims
a
passing
notice
this
propeller
is
so
constructed
as
to
enable
the
engineer
to
regulate
the
speed
of
the
piston
for
pitch
of
the
screw
can
be
increased
or
diminished
at
thus
with
a
fair
wind
by
increasing
the
pitch
without
increasing
the
revolutions
the
full
power
of
the
engine
is
effectually
exerted
in
driving
the
ship
instead
of
consuming
fuel
in
driving
the
engine
to
no
purpose
and
with
a
headwind
by
diminishing
the
pitch
the
engines
are
made
to
do
their
utmost
duty
and
when
the
ship
is
under
canvas
only
the
blades
of
the
propeller
may
be
placed
in
line
with
the
and
thus
offer
little
resistance
another
advantage
claimed
for
this
propeller
known
as
griffith
is
that
in
the
event
of
breaking
a
blade
it
may
be
readily
replaced
by
tipping
the
ship
which
method
merits
careful
consideration
by
engineers
as
does
especially
every
new
propeller
which
promises
a
more
perfect
alliance
with
canvas
to
resume
the
narrative
the
speed
of
the
rattler
was
afterwards
tested
by
a
trial
with
the
alecto
a
steamer
of
equal
power
built
from
the
same
moulds
and
the
result
was
so
favorable
that
the
admiralty
ordered
the
construction
or
conversion
of
vessels
as
and
thus
was
laid
the
foundation
of
the
present
formidable
of
england
the
superiority
which
has
been
asserted
for
the
princeton
was
established
during
the
mexican
war
by
her
performance
before
vera
cruz
as
a
blockading
ship
of
unprecedented
efficiency
which
having
been
displayed
under
the
admiring
observation
of
a
british
squadron
tended
more
than
any
other
single
event
to
confirm
the
admiralty
in
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
experiments
just
related
and
to
decide
them
in
the
adoption
of
the
screw
as
the
best
auxiliary
of
sail
the
best
mechanical
motor
upon
the
ocean
thus
did
england
in
embracing
at
once
the
practical
demonstration
of
the
princeton
display
that
forecast
by
which
she
won
her
ascendency
at
sea
and
the
vigilance
with
which
she
maintains
it
whilst
our
own
government
awaited
in
unbecoming
hesitation
the
results
which
england
more
extended
trials
with
the
screw
might
develop
this
cautious
policy
rather
than
the
bold
and
liberal
course
which
the
maritime
genius
of
the
country
demands
condemned
us
for
long
years
to
inaction
until
at
length
the
absolute
necessity
for
the
renewal
of
a
portion
of
our
naval
force
produced
the
minnesota
class
of
frigates
although
they
developed
little
that
was
absolutely
new
they
are
very
far
from
being
imitations
but
in
model
capacity
equipment
and
above
all
in
their
armament
they
have
challenged
admiration
throughout
the
world
and
called
from
a
distinguished
british
admiral
in
command
the
significant
declaration
that
until
he
had
seen
them
he
had
never
realized
his
ideal
of
a
perfect
a
leading
idea
in
the
conception
of
these
ships
was
to
reduce
the
number
of
from
two
and
three
to
a
single
deck
and
consequently
the
space
in
which
shells
could
be
lodged
this
is
a
consideration
which
must
it
is
believed
sooner
or
later
govern
in
naval
construction
although
france
and
england
long
accustomed
to
measure
the
power
of
ships
by
the
number
of
may
be
more
slow
in
following
our
lead
in
this
respect
than
in
imitating
the
increased
calibre
of
our
ordnance
the
new
classes
of
steamers
preparing
for
sea
of
which
the
hartford
and
iroquois
are
types
promise
to
be
most
efficient
ships
and
to
reflect
much
credit
upon
our
naval
authorities
for
their
bold
yet
judicious
departure
from
traditions
which
had
long
hampered
the
administration
of
this
important
branch
of
the
public
service
although
the
reflection
is
seldom
made
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
much
of
the
reputation
enjoyed
and
of
the
influence
exercised
by
the
united
states
is
due
to
the
efficiency
of
her
navy
and
if
these
are
to
remain
undiminished
then
it
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
that
the
national
ships
should
always
represent
the
highest
advancement
of
science
footnote
a
series
of
experiments
with
the
screw
were
made
on
board
the
dwarf
in
and
on

results

the
efficiency
of
the

having
been
demonstrated
it
was
seen
that
the
next
requirement
for
a
was
to
place
her
machinery
below
the
waterline
and
hence
arose
a
demand
for
an
entirely
new
description
of
engines
which
it
was
clear
would
make
a
great
change
in
all
the
labors
of
the
engineer
and
machinist
such
change
it
was
evident
would
greatly
enhance
the
risk
of
failure
and
therefore
it
was
determined
by
the
admiralty
to
insure
success
in
this
very
difficult
task
by
enlisting
all
the
best
talent
of
the
country
accordingly
for
the
ships
an
equal
number
of
screw
engines
were
ordered
and
as
with
the
constructors
so
with
the
engineers
each
was
required
to
comply
with
certain
conditions
yet
each
was
permitted
to
put
forth
his
own
individuality
and
each
has
illustrated
his
views
of
what
was
required
by
a
distinct
plan
of
engine
the
wise
and
liberal
action
of
the
british
admiralty
which
faltered
at
no
expense
and
made
trial
of
every
improvement
in
machinery
that
gave
assurance
of
good
performance
and
promised
in
any
way
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the

no

than
fourteen

of

are
driven
at
rates
varying
from
fifty
to
revolutions
this
point
is
dwelt
upon
because
it
is
observed
that
many
engineers
find
difficulty
in
freeing
themselves
from
early
impressions
made
by
engines

apprehensions
at
fifty

stand
ready
to
obviate
the
difficulty
by
gearing
which
it
is
hoped
may
not
henceforth
be
adopted
in
our
national
ships
geared
engines
are
much
heavier
than
those
of
direct
connection
and
occupy
more
space
a
great
consideration
in
ships
where
room
for
fuel
is
in
such
demand
besides
making
it
more
difficult
to
place
them
below

a
consideration
which
in
should
be
regarded
of
paramount
importance

the
engines
of

be
as
secure
from
shot
as
her
magazine
experience
has
shown
that
the
apprehensions
entertained
from
the
quick
stroke
of
direct
engines
were
without
foundation
and

will
be

there
was

an
important
defect

be
remedied
namely
the
impediment

to
evolution

presented
by
the

propeller
which
was
accomplished
by
the
invention
of
the

of
a
trunk
or
well
impairs
the
solidity
of
the

it
much
more
vulnerable

its
defences

it

considerable

no
modern
ship
of

is
without
the

of
raising

propeller
and
the
best
opinion
of
commanders
and
engineers
of
that
service
of
longest
experience
in
goes
to
establish
the
conviction
that
for
the
advantages
of
being
able
to
lift
the
propeller
far
more
than
outweigh
the
objections
urged
against
lifting
in
this
connection
we
mention
the
fact
that
all
by
the
wind
have
a
strong
tendency
to
gripe
would
not
this
be
obviated
by
having
a
gate
or
slide
to
fill
out
the
when
the
screw
is
lifted
footnote
might
not
a
metallic
combining
strength
lightness
and
little
resistance
be
introduced
the
best
illustration
of
the
effects
of
a
dragging
propeller
was
afforded
on
the
departure
of
a
russian
squadron
from
cronstadt
bound
to
the
amoor
in
consisting
of
three
sloops
of
war
and
three
schooners
under
the
flag
of
commodore
kouznetsoff
the
vessels
of
each
class
were
built
from
the
same
moulds
and
at
the
time
of
the
experiment
were
of
the
same
draft
and
displacement
on
clearing
the
land
signal
was
made
to
lift
screws
and
make
sail
soon
after
all
the
squadron
reported
the
execution
of
the
order
except
the
voyerada
sloop
which
had
the
misfortune
to
break
a
key
in
the
couplings
and
therefore
could
not
lift
her
screw
every
effort
was
tried
to
get
out
the
key
and
meanwhile
a
very
instructive
example
was
presented
to
the
squadron
of
the
effect
of
a
dragging
propeller
on
the
speed
of
the
vessel
the
circumstances
were
as
follows
the
wind
a
gentle
breeze
right
aft
the
voyerada
carrying
all
sail
but
the
main
course
the
other
two
sloops
holding
way
with
her
with
their
topsails
on
the
cap
and
the
schooners
with
their
peaks
dropped
under
these
conditions
the
voyerada
having
her
fixed
horizontally
could
scarcely
keep
her
position
running
two
and
a
half
and
three
knots
the
voyerada
next
succeeded
in
getting
her
screw
vertical
when
without
any
change
in
the
wind
the
speed
increased
to
four
and
a
half
knots
the
other
sloops
then
mastheaded
their
topsails
and
the
schooners
peaked
their
gaffs
at
length
the
voyerada
succeeded
in
lifting
her
screw
when
immediately
all
the
sloops
under
the
same
canvas
continued
their
course
making
six
to
six
and
a
half
knots
a
better
example
of
the
obstruction
offered
by
a
dragging
propeller
could
not
have
been
afforded
the
shake
to
which
reference
has
been
made
is
the
tremulous
or
vibratory
motion
communicated
to
the
of
the
ship
and
particularly
to
the
stern
by
the
revolution
of
the
propeller
often
opening
the
seams
and
in
old
ships
sometimes
starting
the
butts
and
causing
dangerous
leaks
this
movement
arises
from
two
causes
one
inherent
in
the
screw
the
other
due
to
its
position
in
the
deadwood
the
first
cause
is
the
difference
in
the
propelling
efficiency
of
the
upper
and
lower
blades
when
in
any
other
position
than
horizontal
the
centre
of
pressure
of
the
lower
blade
being
at
a
greater
depth
below
the
surface
than
the
centre
of
pressure
of
the
upper
blade
acts
upon
a
medium
of
greater
resistance
to
displacement
and
the
differential
of
the
pressures
of
the
two
blades
produces
inevitably
a
vibratory
motion
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
this
effect
is
greatly
increased
when
the
clearance
given
to
the
screw
in
the
is
too
small
for
the
reduction
of
the
hydrostatic
pressure
at
the
and
the
increase
of
it
at
the
on
each
passage
of
the
blades
must
be
followed
by
concussion
therefore
if
the
well
or
distance
between
the
posts
be
made
sufficiently
long
in
proportion
to
the
screw
the
shake
due
to
the
latter
cause
can
be
almost
entirely
obviated

by

this
recognition
of
the

desired
to
submit
a
few
general
observations
on
the
french
navy
for
although
upon
every
sea
the
waves
over
ships
proudly
comparing
with
those
under
any
other
flag
it
is
nevertheless
too
commonly
believed
that
the
docks
of
france
are
crowded
and
her
swollen
with
hulks
which
are
but
the
mouldering
mementos
of
the
vast
armaments
hastily
created
during
the
consulate
and
the
empire
an
illusion
most
hazardous
to
our
interests
abroad
and
our
security
at
home
at
the
period
of

of
a
committee
of
inquiry
composed
of
the
most
experienced
and
intelligent
officers
and
distinguished
legislators
had
visited
all
departments
of
the

and
made
the
most
careful
investigations
into
every
branch
of
the
service
upon
the
evidence

obtained
a
report

and
the

of
all

existing

this
report
stamped
on

with
patriotism
and
intelligence
commanded
even
in
the
midst
of

the
support
of
all
parties
the
adhesion
of
every
faction
and
has
since
through
all
changes
in
the
ministry
of
the

formed
the
basis
of
the
action
of
that
department
under
these
auspices
france
has
in
the
last
seven
years
organized
the

composed
of
the
most
modern

worthily
maintains
a

thus
briefly
summing
up
the
forces
of
our
ocean
rivals
we
can
not
avoid
making
some
reflections
suggested
by
the
unpreparedness
of
this
country
to
meet
any
sudden
burst
of
hostility
this
not
only
involves
the
risk
of
national
humiliation
but
paralyzes
our
diplomacy
since
it
deprives
us
of
that
influence
among
the
nations
which
otherwise
from
the
breadth
of
our
territory
the
value
of
our
products
the
activity
of
our
industry
the
importance
of
our
commerce
and
the
extent
of
our
maritime
resources
we
of
right
should
hold
no
country
is
more
interested
than
the
united
states
in
the
maintenance
of
peace
yet
even
on
the
principle
of
economy
we
may
argue
in
favor
of
a
degree
of
preparation
for
war
for
that
calamity
may
best
be
averted
by
taking
from
foreign
powers
the
temptation
to
interfere
with
us
all
history
showing
that
the
justice
and
friendship
of
military
states
are
but
slender
guaranties
for
the
peace
of
a
nation
unprepared
for
attack
it
is
vain
to
talk
of
husbanding
financial
resources
for
war
without
other
preparation
when
once
embarked
in
hostilities
and
in
a
position
to
maintain
our
ground
large
finances
judiciously
used
will
ultimately
command
success
but
no
accumulation
of
funds
can
provide
a
timely
remedy
for
that
weakness
which
can
not
resist
the
first
blow
the
national
safety
should
no
longer
be
left
to
chance
but
be
established
on
a
basis
of
certainty
a
navy
can
not
be
manufactured
nor
a
fortress
built
to
meet
an
emergency
but
should
be
kept
in
considering
the
auxiliary
under
the
views
already
offered
and
in
determining
the
canvas
with
which
she
should
be
supplied
it
will
be
well
to
refer
as
the
best
guide
to
the
fastest
the
class
which
presents
the
greatest
similarity
in
form
to
that
demanded
in
in
these
ships
the
great
length
of
deck
offers
every
facility
for
the
most
advantageous
spread
of
canvas
consequently
the
centre
of
effort
may
he
kept
low
and
the
requisite
power
and
stability
combined
intimately
connected
with
her
is
another
branch
of
the
equipment
of
a
which
requires
the
most
earnest
patient
and
intelligent
consideration
prepared
to
endure
all
the
wear
and
tear
of
a
she
should
at
the
same
time
be
ready
for
transmutation
into
a
namely
when
for
any
urgent
service
her
best
powers
of
steaming
are
required
she
should
be
able
to
divest
herself
speedily
of
yards
and
and
the
special
service
completed
resume
all
her
perfection
as
a
it
would
be
out
of
place
here
to
enter
into
details
of
equipment
in
naval
affairs
nothing
is
improvised
and
a
satisfactory
conclusion
upon
these
points
can
be
arrived
at
only
through
long
experiment
and
perhaps
frequent
disappointment
yet
it
is
not
doubted
that
the
same
ship
may
exhibit
a
handy
and
efficient
rig
develop
a
high
velocity
canvas
and
without
great
power
a
sufficient
speed
under
steam
in
our
navy
away
from
our
own
coast
sail
must
of
necessity
be
the
rule
and
steam
the
reserve
or
special
power
and
without
abandonment
of
our
policy
with
the
depots
of
our
rivals
upon
every
sea
yet
not
a
ton
of
coal
upon
which
we
can
rely
we
should
not
dare
to
send
abroad
a
single
ship
which
whenever
she
gets
up
her
anchor
must
needs
also
get
up
her
steam
fortunately
in
the
creation
of
a
the
united
states
will
not
have
to
encounter
tedious
and
costly
experiments
nor
to
incur
the
risk
of
failure
the
best
form
of
hull
model
of
propeller
and
plan
of
engine
are
already
so
well
established
that
it
is
not
easy
to
fall
into
error
that
which
is
most
to
be
guarded
against
is
the
popular
demand
the
prevailing
mania
for
high
speed
for
which
single
advantage
there
is
such
a
proneness
to
sacrifice
every
other
warlike
quality
that
measure
of
speed
or
power
which
will
enable
a
ship
to
stem
the
currents
of
rivers
to
enter
or
leave
a
port
in
the
face
of
a
moderate
gale
or
to
meet
the
dangers
of
a
should
it
is
conceived
by
many
be
sufficient
and
for
these
exigencies
a
ship
which
with
four
months
supplies
on
board
can
in
calm
weather
and
smooth
water
make
nine
to
ten
knots
under
steam
has
ample
power
this
moderate
rate
is
far
below
the
popular
mark
but
in
considering
this
important
question
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
unlike
the
paddle
the
screw
will
always
coöperate
with
sail
and
that
if
a
ship
would
go
far
under
steam
she
must
be
content
to
go
gently
the
natural
law
regulating
the
speed
of
a
ship
is
that
the
power
requisite
to
propel
her
varies
as
the
cube
of
the
velocity
footnote
the
constructors
and
engineers
of
the
navy
are
unsurpassed
in
professional
art
or
science
and
when
conjoined
with
naval
officers
who
should
always
determine
the
essentials
of
ships
they
are
capable
of
producing
a
that
would
meet
the
requirements
of
all
reasonable
conditions
we
venture
to
say
that
the
failures
with
which
they
have
been
charged
would
be
found
on
investigation
to
be
solely
attributable
to
undue
extraneous
influences
let
it
be
distinctly
understood
what
power
is
here
meant
as
the
power
applied
to
the
propulsion
of
a
vessel
is
only
that
which
acts
upon
her
in
the
direction
of
the
keel
and
as
of
the
gross
indicated
power
developed
by
her
engine
one
portion
is
absorbed
in
working
the
organs
of
its
mechanism
another
in
overcoming
the
friction
of
the
load
while
still
other
proportions
are
expended
in
the
slip
of
the
propeller
and
in
the
friction
of
its
surfaces
on
the
water
only
that
portion
of
the
gross
power
which
remains
is
applied
to
propulsion
and
it
is
this
remainder
which
varies
in
the
ratio
of
the
cube
of
the
speed
hence
a
steamer
that
with
five
hundred
can
make
eight
knots
per
hour
will
require
rather
more
than
one
thousand
to
drive
her
at
the
speed
of
ten
knots
the
law
being
thus
modified
by
the
increased
resistance
consequent
upon
the
greater
weight
of
the
large
engines
and
thus
a
limit
to
speed
is
imposed
depending
upon
the
weight
of
machinery
which
relative
to
her
dimensions
a
ship
can
carry
a
ship
that
at
the
rate
of
ten
knots
under
steam
may
run
twelve
hundred
miles
can
at
the
speed
of
eight
knots
and
with
the
expenditure
of
rather
less
fuel
run
the
distance
of
eighteen
hundred
miles
and
therefore
it
is
many
contend
that
a
for
distant
service
should
not
be
laden
with
large
engines
whose
full
power
can
rarely
be
wanted
and
which
monopolize
so
great
a
space
and
displacement
as
to
render
it
impossible
to
carry
fuel
for
their
proper
development
it
is
true
that
with
large
power
of
engine
the
vessel
may
command
so
long
as
her
coals
last
the
advantage
of
high
speed
and
her
large
cylinders
will
enable
her
by
working
the
steam
very
expansively
to
use
her
fuel
with
great
economy
but
there
still
remains
the
disadvantage
of
the
increased
first
cost
of
the
machinery
and
its
greater
weight
and
bulk
to
be
permanently
carried
whether
used
or
not
and
which
by
increasing
the
displacement
of
the
vessel
proportionally
diminishes
her
speed
the
last
great
improvement
in
connection
with
the
screw
remains
to
be
noticed
namely
lining
the
bushings
and
bearings
with
the
invention
of
penn
of
greenwich
near
london
the
is
introduced
in
the
manner
shown
in
the
drawing
in
connection
therewith
it
must
be
said
that
the
length
and
diameter
of
bearings
has
been
increased
far
beyond
the
proportions
of
former
years
the
brasses
are
bored
out
about
of
an
inch
larger
than
the
shaft
then
the
recesses
are
slotted
out
for
the
reception
of
the
wooden
strips
if
care
be
taken
with
this
part
of
the
operation
any
number
of
strips
can
be
supplied
ready
fitted
and
to
put
in
a
set
of
spare
strips
becomes
a
short
and
simple
operation
illustration
strange
as
it
appears
these
wooden
bearings
are
far
more
durable
than
those
of
metal
and
in
some
ships
they
have
endured
for
years
without
any
perceptible
wear
in
those
parts
which
previously
to
this
invention
had
occasioned
so
much
trouble
and
expense
but
for
this
important
discovery
it
is
thought
by
some
of
the
most
competent
engineers
that
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
abandon
the
use
of
the
screw
in
heavy
ships
the

the
type
of
the

of

and

the
trial
of
this
ship
has
established
the
practicability
of
adapting
a
propeller
to
a
ship
of
the
largest
class
so
as
to
insure
great
speed
and
constitute
a
most
effective
for
certain
purposes
and
in
certain
situations
but
when
the
great
weight
of
the
engines
is
considered
and
the
large
space
they
occupy
in
the
vessel
thereby
diminishing
the
stowage
of
supplies
and
further
that
after
the
coal
is
exhausted
the
ship
has
but
the
sail
of
a
ship
to
rely
upon
it
is
not
easy
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
however
useful
such
a
vessel
may
be
for
short
passages
and
in
those
seas
in
which
her
supplies
of
coal
and
provisions
may
be
constantly
replenished
her
sphere
of
action
must
be
very
limited
and
she
could
not
be
relied
upon
for
the
long
cruises
and
various
services
on
which
an
ordinary
ship
is
employed

a

on
the

of

of
gaining

is

to
sacrifice
a

her
efficiency
in
several
most
important
particulars
in

at
short
distances
from
port
for
the
defence
of

or
harbors
or
the
florida
channel
for
the
speedy
transport
of
troops
to
an
adjacent
coast
or
to
force
a
blockade
such
a
vessel
would
undoubtedly
be
a
most
valuable
addition
to
our
navy
but
her
employment
must
necessarily
be
confined
to
such
circumstances
and
such
situations
for
should
she
unluckily
fall
in
with
an
enemy
squadron
with
her
coal
expended
or
her
machinery
rendered
useless
by
any
of
the
numerous
accidents
to
which
is
so
constantly
exposed
with
her
comparatively
light
rig
and
want
of
stability
in
consequence
of
losing
so
great
a
weight
of
coals
she
would
hardly
prove
a
very
formidable
opponent
therefore
while
admitting
the
importance
and
necessity
of
providing
for
special
service
a
small
class
of
fast
steamers
it
is
submitted
that
the
auxiliary
is
the
description
of
ship
to
which
the
largest
and
best
consideration
should
be
devoted
for
to
the
nation
possessing
the
most
efficient
fleet
of
such
vessels
must
belong
the
dominion
of
the
sea
and
while
their
cost
is
counted
let
it
at
the
same
time
be
remembered
that
their
value
can
be
estimated
only
by
the
character
of
the
service
they
may
render
and
that
their
capacity
for
aggression
abroad
makes
them
the
best
defence
at
home
having
briefly
referred
to
the
various
views
entertained
in
regard
to
the
with
which
the
navy
should
be
furnished
it
will
be
seen
that
a
difference
of
opinion
on
this
important
subject
may
most
reasonably
be
entertained
none
can
doubt
the
advantages
of
celerity
to
a
yet
many
believe
it
would
be
too
dearly
purchased
by
the
sacrifice
of
space
to
such
an
extent
as
would
require
supplies
to
be
often
replenished
as
this
necessity
would
in
war
confine
the
operations
of
the
navy
to
our
own
shores
on
the
other
hand
it
is
admitted
that
without
high
speed
a
ship
of
war
can
not
exercise
many
of
her
most
important
functions
that
she
can
neither
choose
an
engagement
protect
a
convoy
nor
enforce
a
blockade
the
best
experience
affirms
the
policy
of
giving
to
our
cruisers
as
large
steampower
as
is
consistent
with
a
due
development
of
all
other
warlike
qualities
for
what
would
avail
the
superior
armament
of
a
ship
if
the
option
of
fighting
or
flying
remain
with
her
adversary
which
must
be
the
case
when
the
latter
commands
higher
speed
the
introduction
of
improved
ordnance
throwing
heavy
shells
with
great
precision
at
long
ranges
gives
increased
importance
to
celerity
for
in
any
future
victory
should
belong
to
that
flag
having
at
command
a
of
superior
speed
which
may
thereby
be
concentrated
upon
any
point
without
having
been
long
under
fire
may
not
the
command
of
a
maximum
speed
of
thirteen
knots
be
obtained
from
the
machinery
now
employed
for
a
maximum
speed
of
ten
knots
it
evidently
may
and
with
great
economy
too
by
the
simple
introduction
of
artificial
draft
and
the
use
of
steam
of
higher
pressure
when
requiring
the
highest
speed
at
present
in
our
the
boilers
are
proportioned
for
natural
draft
burning
about
twelve
pounds
of
coal
per
square
foot
of
grate
per
hour
and
for
a
of
fifteen
pounds
per
square
inch
if
then
the
boilers
be
proportioned
to
burn
at
the
maximum
with
blowers
say
pounds
of
coal
to
the
square
foot
of
grate
and
to
generate
steam
of
forty
pounds
to
the
square
inch
we
shall
double
the
power
developed
by
the
machinery
and
consequently
derive
from
it
the
same
speed
that
could
be
attained
without
blowers
from
double
the
machinery
while
the
natural
draft
and
the
usual
pressure
of
fifteen
pounds
would
give
sufficient
speed
for
ordinary
service
the
inconvenience
of
the
higher
pressure
with
blowers
could
well
be
endured
for
the
short
and
occasional
periods
during
which
they
would
be
required
to
create
a
perfect
a
ship
with
complete
and
efficient
for
any
service
that
may
be
required
the
endeavor
should
be
made
by
getting
rid
of
every
dispensable
article
of
weight
or
bulk
and
without
reducing
supplies
below
three
months
provisions
and
six
water
to
find
space
and
displacement
for
an
engine
of
sufficient
force
to
drive
her
thirteen
knots
an
hour
together
with
at
least
ten
days
full
consumption
of
fuel
and
this
it
is
believed
might
be
successfully
accomplished
in
ships
of
the
dimensions
of
the
wabash
beginning
with
a
judicious
reduction
of
spare
spars
spare
sails
and
spare
gear
and
by
the
addition
of
blowers
to
their
present
machinery
a
subject
which
should
immediately
receive
the
earnest
consideration
of
a
commission
of
the
most
intelligent
officers
having
fixed
upon
the
proportions
of
hull
and
spars
the
form
of
propeller
and
the
plan
of
engine
a
cautious
discrimination
should
be
exercised
in
multiplying
the
types
of
either
besides
economy
many
other
advantages
would
flow
from
a
judicious
regard
to
similarity
in
build
as
it
would
permit
us
to
relieve
our
ships
of
many
of
the
spare
spars
with
which
they
are
incumbered
and
we
should
probably
not
again
hear
of
suspending
the
operations
of
a
frigate
thousands
of
miles
away
until
a
crank
or
rod
could
be
sent
to
her
because
when
ships
of
the
same
class
are
cruising
together
by
a
careful
distribution
of
spare
spars
and
machinery
among
them
it
is
hardly
probable
that
damage
would
be
sustained
or
loss
of
spars
or
break
down
occur
which
might
not
be
remedied
by
the
resources
of
the
squadron
on
the
other
hand
this
system
not
be
carried
to
a
chinese
extreme
lest
we
follow
too
long
a
false
direction
thus
losing
the
advantage
of
improvements
constantly
being
made
for
such
is
the
change
in
all
things
pertaining
to
maritime
war
that
neither
model
of
hull
plan
of
engine
nor
mould
of
ordnance
is
best
unless
of
the
latest
creation
true
progress
will
be
most
judiciously
sought
in
not
departing
too
suddenly
and
widely
from
the
established
order
white
mice
a
great
many
circumstances
led
me
to
decide
on
leaving
the
convenient
of
silvernail
a
house
correctly
described
as
containing
several
modern
improvements
improperly
as
being
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
all
the
places
of
public
amusement
for
as
the
central
park
of
new
york
is
a
place
of
public
amusement
so
likewise
is
barnum
museum
and
these
two
places
being
at
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
from
each
other
how
could
any
one
house
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
both
but
it
was
not
upon
this
incompatibility
that
any
of
my
objections
were
founded
if
i
have
a
prejudice
it
is
against
being
talked
instead
of
now
silvernail
who
like
the
katydid
of
the
if
small
was
shrill
had
a
way
of
conveying
instructions
to
her
boarders
by
means
of
parables
ostensibly
directed
at
catharine
the
tall
irish
but
in
reality
meant
for
the
ear
of
the
obnoxious
boarder
who
had
lately
transgressed
some
important
statute
of
the
house
made
and
provided
to
meet
a
case
or
cases
a
on
the
stairs
was
usually
the
platform
selected
for
the
delivery
of
a
monologue
in
which
catharine
was
always
assumed
to
be
the
person
addressed
although
i
have
known
instances
in
which
that
excellent
wench
was
at
the
time
of
being
so
conferred
with
in
the
grocery
at
the
corner
about
half
a
block
distant
as
i
could
see
from
the
window
where
i
sat
and
viewed
her
protracting
her
doorway
dalliance
with
jeremiah
tomaters
the
grocer
efficient
young
man
catharine
my
landlady
would
say
in
a
loudish
whisper
close
by
a
malefactor
and
probably
when
catharine
was
yet
far
down
the
street
catharine
who
let
the
water
in
the
bathroom
run
over
just
now
if
the
slippers
he
left
behind
him
jennings
i
declare
boarders
must
be
warned
an
watched
elseways
we
shall
hev
all
in
the
house
afloat
the
stoves
an
somebody
at
moyler
acted
so
and
the
house
was
like
a
roarin
sea
with
the
baby
adrift
in
his
little
cradle
and
the
roaches
round
oh
dear
now
jennings
was
the
serious
boarder
who
lodged
in
the
room
just
over
mine
a
man
who
from
general
indications
had
never
had
a
bath
in
his
life
certainly
he
had
never
troubled
the
waters
in
that
house
i
was
the
supposed
delinquent
and
at
me
the
parable
was
levelled
catharine
whose
was
that
you
found
in
the
door
it
a
mussy
we
was
all
and
in
cold
blood
by
the
light
o
the
moon
jennings
it
must
have
been
to
be
sure
boarders
must
be
warned
and
watched
when
toyler
was
found
in
the
door
of
number
the
boarders
all
went
off
at
daylight
in
an
omnibus
takin
away
custom
and
character
from
the
house
forever
now
jennings
the
serious
boarder
was
always
in
bed
and
asleep
long
before
time
came
round
and
even
supposing
he
ever
let
himself
in
by
means
of
that
mischievous
little
convenience
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
taking
the
door
up
to
bed
with
him
as
of
leaving
the
key
in
it
the
parable
was
intended
for
the
hearing
of
a
young
man
who
occupied
the
room
opposite
mine
and
who
being
connected
with
clubs
came
home
nobody
ever
knew
when
or
in
what
condition
but
had
red
eyes
o
mornings
and
a
general
odor
of
the
convivial
kind
then
again
silvernail
had
a
way
of
being
always
about
the
doors
of
the
rooms
and
a
faculty
as
i
thought
of
hovering
near
several
of
them
at
one
and
the
same
moment
there
are
men
who
will
turn
the
least
promising
circumstance
to
advantage
even
that
of
being
listened
at
through
a
keyhole
while
they
discourse
to
themselves
about
affairs
connected
with
their
most
cherished
and
secret
designs
one
captain
dunnitt
who
lived
in
the
house
before
i
came
adroitly
made
his
account
of
this
eavesdropping
propensity
of
the
landlady
by
settling
his
weekly
bill
with
a
pistol
instead
of
the
dollars
justly
due
he
had
been
a
tragedian
as
well
as
a
captain
and
was
saturated
with
shakspeare
and
other
bards
to
a
far
greater
amount
than
with
money
and
when
his
week
came
round
he
used
to
stride
up
and
down
his
room
with
much
gnashing
of
teeth
and
other
stage
indications
of
distress
finally
settling
down
into
a
chair
before
the
table
on
which
he
would
place
and
replace
a
packet
of
letters
and
a
wisp
of
hair
then
he
would
take
the
little
silver
pistol
from
his
breast
and
after
the
usual
soliloquy
of
to
be
or
not
to
be
or
something
equally
to
the
purpose
would
point
it
at
his
temples
just
as
the
landlady
came
bursting
into
the
room
begging
him
for
all
sakes
not
to
ruin
the
character
of
her
room
and
the
walls
newly
painted
at
that
remorse
would
then
double
up
the
manly
form
of
captain
dunnitt
who
would
fall
on
his
knees
before
the
landlady
his
benefactress
his
better
angel
and
then
arrangements
would
be
entered
into
by
which
he
was
not
to
commit
suicide
for
the
present
but
could
avail
himself
of
the
landlady
indulgence
and
wait
for
that
remittance
which
was
always
coming
but
which
never
came
but
there
were
more
serious
objections
even
than
a
landlady
of
shrill
parables
and
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
to
my
prolonging
the
delights
of
a
residence
at
the
of
silvernail
not
the
least
of
these
was
the
fact
of
its
a
a
community
in
such
communities
from
the
inevitable
intercourse
over
the
social
board
your
circle
of
acquaintance
is
always
liable
to
be
extended
rather
than
improved
in
them
there
is
no
escape
from
the
disinterested
offers
of
those
who
would
be
your
perpetual
friends
i
am
still
under
lasting
obligations
to
a
man
who
at
a
in
which
i
sojourned
for
but
three
days
forced
on
me
a
pipeful
of
an
extremely
choice
and
luxurious
kind
of
tobacco
to
dilate
on
the
properties
of
which
he
came
and
smoked
about
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
it
in
my
room
that
very
evening
and
far
on
into
the
morning
light
his
goodness
is
the
more
impressed
upon
my
memory
because
on
the
same
occasion
he
drank
the
greater
part
of
the
contents
of
a
large
bottle
of
old
croix
rum
which
i
had
just
received
from
a
friend
who
had
imported
it
direct
then
in
communities
one
magnetism
is
as
much
at
fault
as
that
of
a
ship
sailing
up
a
river
whose
shores
are
impregnated
with
iron
elements
i
knew
a
man
who
was
to
the
extent
of
matrimony
by
the
lady
of
the
house
a
widow
and
a
shrew
he
hated
or
at
least
professed
to
hate
her
and
had
ridiculous
stories
about
her
to
no
end
but
she
married
him
and
he
still
lives
another
of
a
rather
unsociable
turn
rejected
the
proffered
civilities
of
all
his
who
ever
came
to
offer
him
rations
of
curious
tobacco
or
to
assist
him
in
performing
a
libation
of
old
and
valuable
hollands
the
only
one
of
the
party
to
whom
he
ever
cottoned
was
the
latest
comer
a
blandulose
kind
of
man
who
smoked
up
all
his
cunning
cigars
made
sad
havoc
among
his
hollanders
of
gin
departed
from
that
house
in
an
unexpected
manner
and
his
friend
best
trousers
in
the
pockets
of
which
he
had
bestowed
that
friend
rarest
gems
and
gold
and
is
now
serving
out
a
term
allotted
to
him
in
the
state
prison
in
recognition
of
the
remarkable
abilities
displayed
by
him
in
the
character
of
what
the
police
call
a
confidence
man
and
yet
there
are
more
objectionable
acquaintances
than
people
who
insist
upon
sharing
with
you
their
friendship
be
they
confidence
men
or
not
i
suppose
we
may
allow
in
these
advanced
times
that
it
is
something
like
magnetism
which
decides
the
question
of
affinity
and
its
reverse
but
in
granting
this
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
observing
that
external
and
palpable
facts
have
a
considerable
effect
in
directing
the
currents
of
magnetism
for
example
and
to
adopt
the
language
of
scientific
men
the
insignificant
circumstance
of
a
person
habituating
himself
to
the
partial
deglutition
of
his
knife
while
partaking
of
food
may
produce
antipathetic
emotions
on
the
part
of
others
whom
prejudice
or
superstition
has
led
to
regard
the
knife
as
an
article
designed
for
cutting
only
this
kind
of
outrage
i
allude
to
merely
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
a
case
in
like
that
of
silvernail
such
rusticities
have
long
since
become
traditional
and
of
the
things
that
have
passed
away
and
indeed
so
particular
was
that
lady
with
regard
to
her
knives
that
had
a
boarder
swallowed
even
a
part
of
one
he
would
undoubtedly
have
heard
the
deed
alluded
to
through
the
keyhole
of
his
on
the
following
day
in
the
form
of
a
parable
having
for
its
hero
the
justified
jennings
our
serious
young
man
if
external
and
palpable
circumstances
then
are
admitted
to
have
a
decided
effect
upon
streams
of
magnetism
i
suppose
we
may
assume
that
they
have
also
a
certain
power
of
determining
impressions
by
themselves
without
the
intervention
of
any
of
the
more
subtile
agencies
whatever
the
granting
of
this
postulate
will
put
me
on
quite
easy
terms
with
regard
to
the
very
positive
objection
entertained
by
me
towards
a
certain
désolé
arcubus
who
by
provision
of
an
immutable
edict
promulgated
by
silvernail
occupied
the
chair
next
mine
at
the
table
of
that
rigid
expounder
of
law
désolé
arcubus
a
young
man
of
some
three
or
four
and
twenty
had
no
special
nationality
about
him
from
which
one
could
guess
how
he
came
by
his
rather
uncommon
names
he
was
reputed
to
be
learned
particularly
in
the
modern
languages
had
a
profusion
of
long
wild
hair
of
a
hue
which
matched
his
complexion
exactly
this
prevalent
tint
being
infused
also
into
the
or
white
of
his
eye
and
in
physical
proportions
was
of
weedy
and
unwholesome
growth
he
was
not
a
young
man
of
cheerful
disposition
on
the
contrary
his
deportment
at
table
where
alone
his
had
any
opportunity
of
observing
him
was
such
as
to
induce
a
very
general
belief
that
his
mind
must
have
been
affected
by
some
terrible
calamity
and
his
presence
indeed
was
looked
upon
as
undesirable
by
many
of
the
guests
whose
health
had
begun
to
suffer
seriously
from
the
manner
in
which
arcubus
used
to
groan
between
his
instalments
of
food
sometimes
in
the
interval
between
the
soup
and
the
solids
he
would
lean
his
elbows
upon
the
table
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
so
that
his
long
sad
hair
swept
the
board
would
abandon
himself
for
a
brief
space
to
private
despondency
until
the
boiled
leg
of
mutton
brought
with
it
a
necessity
for
renewed
action
nor
was
the
social
feeling
of
distrust
of
this
unhappy
young
man
allayed
when
the
party
learned
through
a
boarder
of
detective
instincts
that
désolé
arcubus
was
an
enthusiast
in
scientific
pursuits
and
that
the
romance
of
a
poor
young
man
as
shadowed
out
by
him
was
no
romance
at
all
but
an
unpleasant
reality
toxicology
was
the
branch
of
science
to
which
arcubus
had
for
some
time
past
been
devoting
his
mind
for
fourteen
hours
a
day
he
worked
assiduously
in
the
laboratory
of
an
eminent
analytical
chemist
whose
practice
in
connection
with
the
coroner
was
of
a
flourishing
and
increasing
kind
owing
to
the
growing
taste
for
suicide
and
the
preference
given
to
poisons
over
any
other
means
for
accomplishing
that
irrevocable
wrong
in
this
chamber
of
horrors
a
court
of
which
the
tests
were
the
stern
incorruptible
ordinances
of
nature
he
had
already
gone
steadily
through
a
course
which
gave
him
a
mastery
over
the
secrets
of
the
relative
poisons
with
which
he
laughed
secretly
now
and
played
as
securely
as
a
child
might
with
a
of
whose
thorns
he
had
been
made
aware
but
of
late
his
haggard
features
and
the
start
with
which
he
would
wake
into
life
when
a
guest
haply
plucked
a
flower
from
the
bouquets
on
the
table
or
when
the
handmaiden
came
round
to
him
with
a
dish
of
leguminous
vegetables
could
readily
have
been
traced
by
a
clairvoyant
to
associations
connected
with
the
ghastly
belladonna
and
with
the
deadly
bean
of
ignatius
the
martyr
for
arcubus
had
now
arrived
at
the
investigation
of
the
positive
poisons
a
fact
which
might
have
revealed
itself
to
the
man
of
science
by
the
general
expression
into
which
he
had
settled
down
bodily
while
the
most
casual
observer
might
have
gathered
from
his
incoherent
contributions
to
the
that
some
noxious
drug
was
envenoming
the
cup
of
his
life
he
had
a
way
of
thinking
aloud
and
as
his
thoughts
always
ran
on
the
subject
of
his
studies
the
expression
of
them
sometimes
dovetailed
curiously
with
the
general
conversation
miss
rocket
will
not
come
down
to
dinner
poor
thing
said
silvernail
in
her
choicest
she
has
lost
her
beautiful
angola
kitten
it
slipped
into
the
glass
globe
this
morning
among
the
and
was
drowned
digested
in
water
several
of
its
constituents
are
dissolved
said
arcubus
in
a
husky
voice
looking
wildly
at
the
picture
on
his
plate
you
have
a
for
puddings
i
perceive
madam
remarked
a
smiling
old
gentleman
a
addressing
himself
to
the
hostess
may
i
ask
now
of
what
this
very
excellent
one
is
composed
sulphate
of
lime
potash
oil
resin
extractive
matter
gluten

et
put
in
arcubus
still
following
out
his
train
of
thought
during
the
process
of
evaporation
a
black
substance
is
precipitated
continued
he
and
at
that
very
moment
the
small
colored
boy
running
to
pour
out
some
water
for
the
wild
boarder
who
had
just
arrived
in
an
excited
condition
from
a
rowing
match
caught
his
foot
in
the
carpet
and
came
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
black
oxide
of
mercury
called
per
pursued
arcubus
grappling
with
his
tangled
hair
do
just
try
a
drop
or
two
of
this
hollands
of
mine
in
that
iced
water
it
is
positively
dangerous
to
drink
it
so
said
an
attentive
boarder
to
silvernail
who
certainly
look
warm
absorbs
oxygen
readily
when
brought
to
a
red
heat
said
arcubus
abstractedly
as
he
pulled
at
his
long
fingers
and
made
their
joints
crack
who
is
the
tall
lady
who
dined
here
yesterday
with
miss
rocket
and
talked
so
enthusiastically
about
woman
rights
inquired
the
serious
boarder
of
silvernail
prepared
by
deflagration
in
a
crucible
one
part
of
nitre
with
two
of
powdered
tartar
proceeded
arcubus
what
do
you
think
of
that
sample
of
mixed
tobacco
i
gave
you
to
try
asked
the
wild
boarder
of
another
whom
silvernail
used
to
speak
of
with
fear
and
doubt
when
heated
it
readily
sublimes
in
the
form
of
a
dense
white
vapor
said
arcubus
confidently
disagreeably
affecting
the
nose
and
eyes
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
bring
another
dog
into
the
house
puglock
remonstrated
silvernail
addressing
the
wild
boarder
to
whose
conversation
she
had
been
lending
a
sharp
ear
now
i
must
restrict
the
number
of
dogs
we
have
three
here
already
i
believe
there
is
a
strong
analogy
between
the
virus
injected
into
wounds
made
by
the
teeth
of
a
rabid
dog
and
that
found
in
the
of
venomous
snakes
brought
in
arcubus
diving
his
fork
truculently
into
a
ripe
tomato
this
last
observation
of
arcubus
together
with
the
fact
that
the
blade
of
his
knife
had
manifestly
turned
black
while
all
the
other
blades
at
table
were
as
bright
as
silver
decided
me
i
packed
up
my
portmanteau
and
that
evening
and
having
settled
with
my
wondering
landlady
to
whom
i
accounted
for
my
sudden
departure
by
pleading
expediency
as
to
important
affairs
took
leave
of
that
estimable
widow
and
drove
away
to
a
distant
hotel
from
which
i
sallied
forth
early
next
morning
to
look
for
lodgings
furnished
lodgings
for
single
gentlemen
without
board
for
against
i
had
set
my
face
forever
a
peculiar
feature
of
life
in
lodgings
in
new
york
as
in
other
large
cities
is
the
incomparable
solitude
attainable
in
that
blessed
state
of
deliverance
from
promiscuous
board
one
may
dwell
for
a
twelvemonth
in
lodgings
for
single
gentlemen
without
incurring
the
obligation
of
knowing
by
sight
or
even
by
name
the
lodger
who
occupies
the
very
room
opposite
to
his
on
the
same
landing
fifty
lodgers
may
have
successively
lived
in
those
apartments
during
the
twelve
months
on
the
same
terms
of
perfect
isolation
from
one
who
would
rather
mind
his
own
business
than
make
any
inquiries
regarding
theirs
and
so
it
is
that
of
all
the
which
have
achieved
popularity
in
our
day
none
is
more
faithful
to
the
facts
than
the
one
of
box
and
cox
yet
but
for
the
exigencies
of
the
drama
which
of
course
has
for
its
principal
object
the
development
of
a
plot
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
whatever
for
bringing
box
on
a
footing
of
acquaintance
with
cox
still
less
for
attributing
to
either
of
them
an
idea
of
his
landlady
name
for
several
months
i
lived
contentedly
in
the
house
selected
by
me
up
one
pair
of
stairs
in
a
room
looking
out
into
a
busy
street
a
street
so
narrow
that
the
trees
at
one
side
of
it
whenever
a
reviving
breeze
brought
with
it
a
subject
for
greeting
and
congratulation
shook
hands
in
quite
a
friendly
manner
with
those
at
the
other
to
illustrate
the
isolation
of
a
residence
in
these
lodgings
i
may
as
well
state
that
during
all
the
time
of
my
sojourn
there
i
never
arrived
at
the
knowledge
of
my
landlady
name
it
was
not
graven
upon
the
and
as
a
knowledge
of
it
was
of
no
immediate
consequence
to
any
of
my
occupations
nor
likely
to
be
i
never
asked
about
it
from
the
old
woman
who
kept
the
rooms
in
order
and
to
whom
i
seldom
spoke
except
upon
the
weekly
occasion
of
handing
to
her
the
amount
due
to
the
landlady
with
whom
i
never
had
any
interview
after
the
day
i
agreed
with
her
for
the
lodgings
i
believe
there
was
a
landlord
if
that
be
the
proper
term
to
apply
to
a
man
who
is
the
husband
of
a
landlady
and
nothing
else
from
my
window
i
once
observed
a
man
who
might
have
been
the
landlord
a
man
of
subdued
appearance
accompanying
the
lady
of
the
house
to
church
subsequently
as
i
came
in
one
evening
rather
earlier
than
usual
the
same
person
was
leaning
against
the
railings
by
the
smoking
a
cigar
he
greeted
me
as
i
passed
in
addressing
me
in
an
interrogative
manner
with
one
word
the
only
one
i
ever
heard
him
utter
owasyerelthbin
to
which
as
i
supposed
him
to
be
a
foreigner
unacquainted
with
the
english
tongue
i
replied
at
random
in
the
only
word
of
german
of
which
i
happen
to
be
master
yaw
and
this
was
the
only
communication
i
ever
had
with
people
of
the
house
excepting
occasional
conversations
with
the
old
woman
who
cleaned
the
windows
and
swept
the
floors
while
with
regard
to
a
dozen
or
two
of
lodgers
who
succeeded
each
other
from
time
to
time
in
the
other
disposable
rooms
of
the
house
i
never
saw
one
of
them
nor
was
acquainted
with
them
otherwise
than
by
footstep
and
that
rather
infelicitously
at
one
time
in
the
case
of
something
which
went
either
upon
crutches
or
wooden
legs
and
which
occupied
the
room
immediately
over
mine
this
was
in
charming
contrast
with
life
at
silvernail
in
its
freedom
from
parables
and
from
the
society
of
miss
rocket
guests
likewise
from
that
of
the
serious
and
vicious
boarders
and
above
all
of
the
poisonous
young
man
a
day
came
for
cleaning
my
windows
and
as
it
rained
heavily
i
could
not
give
the
old
woman
a
clear
stage
by
going
out
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
told
her
to
clean
away
and
be
as
lively
as
she
could
while
i
sat
there
and
wrote
lodgers
she
told
me
as
she
polished
up
the
brightening
panes
came
and
went
week
after
week
so
fast
that
she
forgot
one
when
another
came
and
never
knew
any
of
their
names
she
had
an
eye
for
character
though
and
told
me
the
peculiarities
of
some
of
them
in
a
quaint
way
nailing
her
sentences
now
and
then
with
odd
hard
words
put
in
independently
of
the
general
text
and
who
lives
in
the
room
just
under
mine
somebody
who
raises
plants
i
see
unless
the
green
things
on
the
balcony
belong
to
the
house
a
gentleman
as
keeps
emself
quite
emself
lonesome
and
friendless
i
reckon
for
he
looks
but
poorly
plants
out
queer
sasses
in
boxes
all
the
time
and
some
of
on
the
balcoany
itself
guess
he
makes
kinder
tea
of
or
decoctifies
and
who
in
the
room
opposite
on
this
floor
empty
now
two
little
gentlemen
had
it
for
a
fortnight
jews
i
reckon
and
as
like
one
another
as
two
spots
of
dirt
on
this
pane
of
glass
spoke
a
kind
of
tongue
and
was
furriners
i
guess
polyanders
the
vacant
room
would
just
suit
de
vonville
who
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
from
abroad
i
told
him
of
it
and
he
came
in
the
next
day
bag
and
baggage
a
portion
of
which
latter
was
curious
and
uncommon
de
vonville
with
whom
i
had
lived
in
lodgings
two
or
three
years
previously
was
a
belgian
and
a
and
a
man
of
rare
companionable
qualities
besides
professionally
i
believe
he
called
himself
a
naturalist
he
had
already
roamed
over
the
greater
part
of
america
north
and
south
investigating
the
mysteries
of
nature
especially
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
contributing
as
he
went
many
specimens
of
rare
animals
to
the
principal
collections
of
europe
his
latest
adventures
took
him
through
africa
and
the
east
whence
he
brought
to
new
york
a
number
of
living
creatures
of
many
species
all
of
which
however
he
had
shipped
for
havre
before
i
met
him
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
of
the
least
disreputable
kinds
which
he
meant
to
keep
about
him
as
pets
the
most
valued
of
these
treasures
were
a
small
animal
called
a
mangouste
and
a
cage
containing
a
family
of
white
mice
these
white
mice
were
greatly
prized
by
de
vonville
on
account
of
the
rare
manner
in
which
they
were
marked
their
paws
and
muzzles
being
of
a
perfect
jet
black
they
were
quite
tame
and
familiar
but
on
the
approach
of
a
cat
or
any
other
cause
for
alarm
the
whole
family
would
concentrate
their
energies
in
a
very
remarkable
way
into
one
piercing
squeak
the
mangouste
an
animal
somewhat
resembling
a
ferret
but
more
nearly
allied
to
the
nilotic
ichneumon
of
egypt
was
a
marvellously
lithe
and
active
little
creature
perfectly
tame
and
coming
as
readily
as
a
dog
to
his
name
mungo
except
when
overfed
when
he
would
sleep
sometimes
for
hours
rolled
up
at
the
bottom
of
his
cage
or
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
room
there
were
personal
reminiscences
connected
with
mungo
which
rendered
him
particularly
valuable
to
de
vonville
whom
he
had
often
saved
from
the
stings
of
the
noxious
vermin
to
be
encountered
by
those
who
dwell
in
tents
his
instinct
was
for
creeping
things
though
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
dined
contentedly
on
a
brace
of
white
mice
one
piece
of
mischief
he
committed
during
the
few
days
he
was
allowed
to
run
about
the
rooms
he
gnawed
holes
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
doors
through
which
he
could
let
himself
in
and
out
he
used
to
lie
in
the
sun
on
my
table
as
i
sat
reading
and
was
generally
companionable
and
trustworthy
notwithstanding
his
insidious
look
seeing
the
interest
i
took
in
his
small
menagerie
de
vonville
begged
me
to
undertake
the
superintendence
of
it
on
his
being
called
away
for
a
brief
tour
to
baltimore
and
elsewhere
in
pursuance
of
an
engagement
to
deliver
a
course
of
traveller
tales
numerous
were
the
directions
i
had
from
him
as
to
the
diet
and
general
treatment
most
congenial
to
the
constitutions
of
white
mice
and
there
was
implicit
confidence
expressed
that
for
safety
the
mangouste
should
be
kept
strictly
confined
to
his
cage
there
were
parrots
to
be
looked
after
also
including
an
extremely
vituperative
old
macaw
any
verbal
communication
with
whom
laid
the
advancing
party
open
to
all
manner
of
insult
and
objurgation
the
very
first
day
of
my
menagerial
experience
the
mangouste
got
out
of
his
cage
while
i
was
feeding
him
and
glided
away
into
dark
nooks
and
garrets
unknown
i
failed
of
recovering
him
by
a
stalking
process
among
the
giddy
passes
of
the
upper
stairs
nor
did
he
return
that
day
to
my
call
for
i
vociferated
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
the
word
mungo
in
a
manner
that
must
have
led
the
mysterious
inhabitants
of
that
silent
house
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
a
spiritual
medium
inviting
revelations
from
the
shade
of
the
mighty
park
a
hot
clammy
night
no
balmy
essences
arise
from
the
kennels
of
this
hollow
street
in
which
i
live
whatever
comes
from
that
quarter
must
be
malarious
if
anything
the
windows
are
thrown
open
as
far
as
they
were
made
to
be
thrown
and
i
get
as
far
out
of
one
of
them
as
i
safely
can
by
tilting
my
chair
back
and
extending
my
legs
out
into
that
undefined
everywhere
called
the
wide
wide
world
the
only
newspaper
within
reach
of
my
hand
is
one
i
have
already
looked
over
but
i
glance
at
it
again
reading
backwards
from
the
end
an
account
of
a
terrible
poisoning
case
lately
brought
to
light
in
england
which
i
had
already
read
forwards
from
the
beginning
throwing
it
away
from
me
in
disgust
i
reach
out
my
other
hand
for
a
book
the
one
i
lay
hold
of
is
the
melancholy
drama
of
sir
theodosius
boughton
by
insidious
poisoner
killed
i
dashed
it
away
backwards
over
my
head
and
turning
off
the
gas
abandoned
myself
to
the
strange
influences
that
breathed
hotly
upon
me
from
the
clammy
vegetation
festering
in
the
ropy
why
do
civic
choose
the
for
a
to
the
inhabitants
of
towns
nothing
can
be
more
graceful
certainly
than
the
ellipses
arched
by
the
boughs
from
its
taper
stem
few
contrivances
more
umbrageous
than
the
combination
of
its
long
feathery
foliations
into
its
perfection
of
a
parasol
but
there
are
times
in
the
dank
hot
nights
of
midsummer
when
the
ailantus
is
but
a
diluted
of
macassar
tainting
albeit
with
no
deadly
essence
the
muggy
air
that
rocks
its
slumbering
branches
and
rolls
away
thence
along
the
parapets
and
in
at
the
windows
of
the
sleepers
chestnut
it
might
reasonably
be
called
because
of
its
heavy
carrion
smell
which
under
the
influences
of
a
july
night
is
but
too
perceptible
to
the
dwellers
of
streets
where
it
abides
the
tree
at
my
window
was
an
ailantus
of
stately
dimensions
and
bounteous
in
a
proportionate
enormity
of
smell
yet
it
had
never
before
affected
me
so
much
as
on
this
night
when
i
lay
dozing
in
the
ghastly
gloom
sleep
must
have
overcome
me
for
i
had
a
troublous
dream
or
vision
of
which
poison
was
the
predominant
nightmare
a
dream
and
slumber
broken
by
the
convulsive
sensation
which
roused
me
up
as
i
endeavored
in
imagination
to
swallow
at
one
draught
the
contents
of
a
metal
tankard
of
half
and
half
decoction
of
henbane
handed
to
me
on
a
leaden
salver
by
a
with
a
sprig
of
hemlock
in
the
third
buttonhole
of
his
coat
this
lethean
influence
could
hardly
be
that
of
the
alone
what
of
the
plants
on
the
balcony
beneath
the
strange
rooty
coilers
which
the
mysterious
planter
sedulously
fosters
at
the
glooming
of
dusk
with
a
weird
held
forth
in
a
hand
in
a
particular
condition
of
the
nerves
say
when
a
man
feels
shaky
it
takes
but
little
to
convince
him
that
anything
which
may
possibly
not
be
all
right
is
to
a
moral
certainty
all
wrong
to
sleep
another
night
in
that
room
with
the
windows
open
and
who
would
shut
his
windows
in
july
directly
exposed
to
the
exhalations
of
a
rising
forest
of
of
macassar
nurtured
by
the
unwholesome
hand
of
a
mysterious
vegetarian
for
purposes
unavowed
was
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
de
vonville
room
which
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
had
no
fuming
ailantus
by
its
windows
on
which
to
browse
nightmares
of
skunkish
flavor
afforded
a
better
climate
for
a
night
rest
notwithstanding
the
singular
ideas
which
these
travelled
men
especially
naturalists
have
of
comfort
in
a
civilized
sense
he
invariably
slept
on
the
floor
converting
his
room
indeed
into
the
general
semblance
of
a
tent
by
divesting
it
of
all
the
appliances
dear
to
a
christian
gentleman
and
one
who
loves
to
repose
as
such
yet
there
was
comparative
freshness
in
that
apartment
as
i
entered
it
that
night
shutting
the
door
of
mine
after
me
to
prevent
ailantus
and
from
following
in
my
wake
the
little
beasts
were
all
sleeping
tranquilly
in
their
cages
and
the
birds
on
their
perches
rested
quietly
too
excepting
the
old
macaw
who
cursed
me
in
his
sleep
as
i
lit
up
the
gas
but
the
mangouste
had
not
returned
nor
did
i
quite
regret
his
absence
for
the
present
because
although
highly
approving
of
the
culture
of
beasts
be
they
large
or
small
i
have
a
prejudice
against
having
my
jugular
vein
breathed
at
midnight
by
small
animals
of
the
weasel
tribe
an
act
of
which
mungo
probably
would
have
been
incapable
his
relations
do
such
things
however
and
newspapers
recording
appalling
instances
of
it
may
be
found
shutting
the
door
i
turned
the
gas
down
to
a
mere
spark
and
stretched
my
weary
limbs
on
the
mat
which
served
the
travelled
man
for
a
bed
drawing
over
me
a
fabric
which
i
suppose
answers
in
tropical
countries
all
the
purposes
of
the
more
voluminous
of
ours
sleep
soon
came
upon
me
a
heavy
but
unquiet
sleep
in
which
the
same
influences
haunted
me
as
those
i
felt
when
slumbering
at
the
window
the
malaria
from
the
trees
was
there
and
the
planter
of
the
balcony
watering
henbane
and
hellebore
with
boiling
aquafortis
likewise
the
with
his
leaden
salver
and
poisoned
tankard
wearing
an
ophidian
smile
on
his
features
and
a
fresh
sprig
of
hemlock
in
his
third
buttonhole
how
long
i
slept
thus
i
know
not
once
i
had
a
vague
sense
of
the
mangouste
gliding
across
me
but
it
was
only
part
of
a
dream
and
it
was
still
night
black
and
awful
when
i
started
up
in
good
earnest
at
a
piercing
shriek
from
the
united
family
of
white
mice
whose
cage
stood
upon
a
low
stand
about
two
yards
to
the
right
of
where
i
lay
the
sound
which
followed
this
was
one
which
the
man
is
not
likely
to
forget
who
has
once
heard
it
whether
beneath
his
foot
as
he
steps
upon
the
log
in
the
rank
or
under
his
hand
when
about
to
grasp
with
it
a
ledge
of
the
rocks
among
which
he
is
clambering
unknowing
of
the
serpent
dens
with
clenched
teeth
and
hair
that
rustled
like
the
i
rose
and
woke
up
the
obedient
gas
which
flashed
tremulously
on
the
scales
of
an
enormous
rattlesnake
coiled
round
the
mice
cage
tightening
his
folds
as
he
whizzed
his
infernal
warning
and
darting
out
his
lightning
tongue
with
baffled
fury
at
the
trembling
group
in
the
middle
of
the
cage
this
i
saw
by
the
first
flash
grasping
a
sword
from
among
the
weapons
with
which
the
walls
were
studded
i
made
a
pass
to
sever
the
monster
but
the
mangouste
was
quicker
than
i
as
he
darted
upon
the
coils
of
the
serpent
which
in
a
moment
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
a
writhing
headless
mass
in
the
heavy
dreams
which
haunted
me
during
the
sleep
from
which
i
had
just
been
roused
i
had
a
vision
of
the
planter
of
the
balcony
with
a
snake
coiled
round
his
naked
arm
who
so
dull
as
to
require
an
interpreter
for
such
plain
speakings
rushing
i
burst
open
the
door
of
that
person
room
with
one
kick
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
bending
over
a
censer
of
charcoal
knelt
désolé
arcubus
the
of
silvernails
his
features
were
collapsed
and
livid
and
he
held
his
left
arm
which
was
much
swollen
and
discolored
close
over
the
coals
basting
it
wildly
the
while
with
ladlefuls
of
some
hot
liquid
while
he
crammed
into
his
mouth
at
intervals
a
handful
of
of
some
kind
from
a
on
the
floor
beside
him
he
was
rapidly
growing
faint
and
sinking
but
indicated
his
wishes
by
signs
and
one
of
several
strangers
who
now
entered
the
room
continued
the
fomenting
treatment
while
another
ran
for
medical
assistance
there
was
an
open
letter
on
the
table
which
i
had
no
hesitation
in
reading
when
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
threw
light
on
the
matter

cluck
here
was
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
for
his
experiments
in
septic
poisons
arcubus
had
hired
this
apartment
with
its
convenient
balcony
for
the
cultivation
of
his
antidotes
having
prepared
his
decoctions
he
had
this
night
caused
himself
to
be
bitten
by
the
snake
which
disgusted
probably
at
its
services
being
then
rudely
dispensed
with
had
followed
its
guiding
instinct
up
to
the
room
where
the
animals
were
making
its
way
through
the
holes
nibbled
by
the
mangouste
underneath
the
doors
a
cold
shudder
seized
me
when
i
guessed
the
reality
of
the
sense
of
something
gliding
over
me
in
the
night
the
hunger
of
the
reptile
had
steered
him
straight
to
the
cage
of
the
mice
whose
cry
of
agony
at
the
presence
of
the
great
enemy
of
had
fortunately
roused
me
from
my
lethargy
for
the
rattle
of
the
snake
is
but
a
drowsy
sound
and
will
not
awaken
the
sleeper
how
the
mangouste
came
to
appear
on
the
scene
at
the
nick
of
time
i
know
not
he
might
have
come
in
at
the
open
window
or
possibly
had
been
sleeping
since
i
missed
him
among
the
trappings
and
traveller
gear
with
which
the
room
was
lumbered
and
these
were
the
delights
of
lodgings
of
lodgings
without
board
and
who
could
see
the
end
of
it
all
for
if
lurked
on
the
stairs
probably
hydrophobia
was
tied
up
in
the
cupboard
brief
time
i
expended
in
making
my
arrangements
to
quit
having
first
seen
arcubus
carted
away
to
a
hospital
where
by
skilful
treatment
he
slowly
recovered
for
the
mangouste
and
the
mice
the
parrots
and
the
blasphemous
macaw
i
engaged
temporary
board
and
lodging
with
a
man
in
the
neighborhood
telegraphing
de
vonville
that
i
had
departed
from
lodgings
forever
lodgings
for
single
gentlemen
without
board
but
on
leaving
the
house
i
did
not
forget
the
old
woman
whose
last
words
to
me
as
i
tipped
her
with
a
gratuity
were
oracular
forty
long
years
and
more
have
i
lived
in
and
never
before
seen
a
sarpint
it
behooves
all
on
us
now
to
be
watchful
for
what
may
be
coming
next
and
wakeful
circumspectangular
i
live
in
a
hotel
now
a
very
noisy
life
and
fearfully
expensive
but
what
do
you
wish
my
friend
as
the
french
say
in
their
peculiar
idiom
believing
in
the
ancient
egyptians
who
worshipped
the
nilotic
ichneumon
i
have
privately
canonized
his
cousin
the
mangouste
by
the
style
and
title
of
mungo
and
if
ever
surplus
funds
are
discovered
to
my
credit
in
any
solvent
bank
at

unknown
to

i
will
certainly
devote
a

of
them

of
decayed

that

the

four
years

we
struck
our

homeless
babes
we
yearned
our
all

such
a
gift
of
grace
all
heaven
narrowed
down
to
us
in
one
dear
little
face

many
a
pang
we
felt
dear
wife
with
hurt
of
heart
and
ache
all
shut
within
like
clasping
knife
for
christie
sake
i
would
no
tears
might
run
down
her
patient
face
beside
such
happy
pearls
of
heart
as
crown
young

is
a
face
that
looking
up
to
passing
heaven
might
make
an
angel
stop
a
blessing
drop
for
christie
sake
if
love
in
that
child
heart
of
hers
should
breathe
and
break
its
calm
with
trouble
sweet
as
that
which
stirs
the
brooding
buds

at

of
peeping
pearl
glistening
in

their

our

father
if
our

must
mourn
be
merciful
and
kind

if
our
gentle

be
shorn
attemper
thou
the

across
the

guide
our
dove
and
to
thy
bosom
take
with
arm
of
love
and
shield
above
for
christie

we
have
had
sorrows
many
and
strange
poor
christie
i
when
i
gone
some
of
my
words
will
weirdly
change
if
she
read
sadly
on
lightnings
from
what
was
dark
of
old
with
meanings
strange
will
break
of
sorrows
hid
or
dimly
told
for
christie
sake
wife
we
should
still
try
hard
to
win
the
best
for
our
dear
child
and
keep
a
within
when
all
without
grows
wild
as
on
the
winter
graves
the
snow
falls
softly
flake
by
flake
our
love
should
whitely
clothe
our
woe
for
christie
sake
for
one
will
wake
at
midnight
drear
from
out
a
dream
of
death
and
find
no
dear
head
pillowed
near
no
sound
of
peaceful
breath
may
no
weak
wailing
words
arise
no
bitter
thoughts
awake
to
see
the
tears
in
memory
eyes
for
christie
sake
and
there
where
many
crownless
kings
of
earth
a
crown
shall
wear
the
martyrs
who
have
borne
the
pangs
their
palm
at
last
shall
bear
when
with
our
lily
pure
of
sin
our
heavenward
way
we
take
there
may
we
walk
with
welcome
in

christie
sake
the

we
have
often
longed
for
a
sight
of
that
precious
bit
of
aërolite

talismanic
and
bewildering
boulder
to
which
the
lips
of
all
devoted
to
infantile
education
must
be
religiously
pressed
in
vain
have
we
searched
in
the
closet
where
the
headless
dolls
and
tailless
horses
the
collapsed
drum
and
the
torn

are
put
away

privately
climbed
to
the

surreptitiously
invaded

not

it

its
existence
none
the
less
real

the
of
the
scottish
kings

in
westminster

thereupon

in

confessional
tell
us
why
you
kept
back
that
explanation
of
its
dependence
on
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
which
at
professor
cram
finishing
examination
in
your
days
you
so
glibly
recited
before
your
admiring
papa
and

do
you
really
believe
that
the
solar
and
stellar
system
was
arranged
to
accommodate
the
reapers

early
of
the
little
island
of
great
britain
we
think
you
said
angels
when
little
isabel
montgomery
with
her
long
sunny
curls
and
sweet
blue
eyes
was
taken
away
you
made
a
very
touching
application
of
her
decease
to
illustrate
what
all
good
people
were
to
become
in
the
unknown
world
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
scrape
which
followed
the
remark
of
your
downright
eldest
remembering
also
the
departure
of
a
obese
elderly
neighbor

a

so
he
probably
is
but
simmons
two
hundred
pounds
of
earthliness
did
not
suit
your
sentimentality
quite
as
readily
as
the
little
fairy
who
always
wore
such
clean
pantalets
and
never
tore
her
pretty
white
frocks
in
a
game
of
romps
is
beatification
dependent
upon
the
and
what
amount
of
flesh
will
turn
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
del
diavolo
once
upon
a
time
a
little
boy
was
allowed
to
ramble
in
the
woods
being
an
adventurous
little
boy
he
saw
and
coveted
and
also
conquered
in
the
good
old
english
sense
of
the
word
a
pretty
and
its
contents
to
wit
several
shiny
speckled
eggs
he
brought
them
home
for
triumphant
display
he
set
them
out
upon
the
table
and
called
a
family
conclave
to
admire
and
exult
what
was
the
surprise
and
grief
of
the
infant
catiline
to
find
himself
received
not
with
applause
but
horror
he
was
accused
of
robbery
was
threatened
with
solomonic
penalties
was
finally
condemned
to
penance
at
a
upon
dry
bread
and
water
while
his
innocent
brothers
and
sisters
were
regaling
upon
chickens
and
custards
he
was
edified
over
his
scanty
meal
by
melting
descriptions
of
the
returning
to
the
desolated
home
of
her
positive
sorrow
and
her
probable
pining
to
death
and
the
same
little
boy
looking
out
through
the
of
the
saw
his
mother
take
by
the
hand
his
weeping
sister
much
cast
down
by
the
fraternal
wickedness
and
lead
her
to
the
nest
of
another
and
then
and
there
encourage
her
to
perform
the
same
act
of
spoliation
true
the
eggs
were
not
speckled
and
small
but
of
a
very
pretty
white
and
quite
a
handful
for
the
juvenile
fingers
but
the
bereaved
parient
was
not
slender
and
active
in
fact
was
rather
a
tame
confiding
dumpy
and
dull
dame
her
complaints
were
not
touching
but
rather
ludicrous
so
much
so
indeed
as
to
suggest
to
the
human
that
biddy
was
laughing
to
think
what
a
nice
breakfast
little
carrie
would
have
off
her
nice
eggs
the
young
trenck
from
aloft
beholding
could
not
but
stumble
upon
certain
glittering
generalities
as
that
eggs
was
eggs
and
that
the
return
of
them
on
the
fowl
part
in
consideration
of
an
advance
of
corn
was
not
altogether
a
voluntary
barter
quite
in
short
after
the
pattern
of
coolie
apprenticeship
and
thus
the
high
moral
lesson
of
the
morning
was
sadly
shaken
of
course
this
boy
did
not
belong
to
any
of
the
model
mammas
for
whom
we
are
writing
a
large
fragment
of
the
nursery
has
been
made
over
to
have
and
to
hold
to
the
writers
of
the
children
library
we
yawn
over
poetical
justice
in
novels
and
only
tolerate
it
as
an
amusing
absurdity
in
genteel
comedy
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
curtain
rapidly
down
over
the
benedictory
guardian
and
the
fair
who
are
impatient
themselves
to
be
off
to
a
very
different
distribution
of
cakes
and
ale
we
know
that
the
hero
and
the
heroine
walk
complacently
away
in
the
company
of
the
dejected
villain
to
wash
off
their
rouge
and
burnt
cork
and
experience
the
practical
domestic
felicity
which
is
ordered
for
them
on
the
same
principles
as
for
us
who
sit
in
the
pit
and
applaud
if
it
were
not
so
and
if
we
did
not
know
it
to
be
so
and
if
we
did
not
know
that
they
know
that
we
know
it
we
should
perhaps
feel
very
differently
why
must
we
then
be
conscientiously
constrained
to
mark
out
such
a
very
different
plan
for
our
children
at
home
why
is
the
life
of
little
boys
and
girls
in
books
always
pictured
on
the
pattern
we
remember
that
we
were
of
those
good
little
boys
and
girls
quite
as
good
as
that
one
who
saved
his
pennies
for
the
or
that
other
who
hemmed
a
tiny
against
the
nasal
needs
of
a
forlorn
infant
in
burmah
but
we
do
remember
ever
then
or
since
to
have
encountered
any
of
those
delightful
and
mothers
or
those
sensible
and
always
fathers
of
whom
we
read
neither
in
our
own
particularly
pleasant
home
nor
in
any
where
we
went
at
three
to
take
an
early
tea
with
preparatory
barmecidal
rehearsals
on
doll
china
did
we
ever
meet
them
perhaps
they
were
the
progenitors
of
the
authors
of
the
books
thackeray
has
introduced
us
to
sundry
gentlemen
and
ladies
bearing
a
faint
likeness
to
them
but
he
also
permitted
us
to
behold
lady
beckie
crawley
sharpe
boxing
little
rawdon
ears
and
to
meet
hobson
newcome
at
one
of
her
delightful
at
homes
where
runmun
loll
of
east
indian
origin
was
the
lion
of
the
evening
we
could
get
through
five
pages
of
hannah
more
on
a
wet
day
at
the
dreariest
when
the
expected
train
was
telegraphed
as
not
due
under
two
hours
what
have
the
innocent
heirs
of
our
name
done
that
hannah
should
continue
under
numberless
to
cater
for
them
we
know
there
must
have
been
a
large
lump
of
the
conglomerate
probably
kept
in
the
desk
of
our
reverend
instructor
in
the
ways
of
syntax
and
the
dismal
paths
of
numbers
we
have
a
lively
recollection
of
the
countless
tables
of
foreign
coins
which
we
committed
to
memory
and
of
the
provoking
additions
and
subtractions
we
underwent
to
reduce
to
dollars
and
cents
of
the
federal
denomination
the
fortunes
of
a
score
of
rothschilds
but
when
under
the
shadow
of
the
drachenfels
we
attempted
to
reimburse
the
teutonic
waiter
for
a
cup
of
we
were
ignominiously
constrained
to
hold
forth
a
handful
of
coin
and
to
await
the
and
bearded
one
pleasure
as
he
helped
himself
we
have
a
strong
impression
that
we
should
never
have
attained
to
our
present
proud
position
of
being
allowed
to
write
for
and
be
printed
in
the
atlantic
monthly
without
much
previous
polish
through
the
companionship
of
the
fairer
sex
why
was
it
made
a
crime
worthy
of
draconian
sternness
to
address
our
in
the
pleasant
paths
of
learning
why
did
we
behold
the
severe
magister
morum
himself
in
utter
forgetfulness
of
his
own
rule
mingle
in
the
mazy
dance
on
an
evening
occasion
at
which
we
were
allowed
to
sit
up
did
the
girls
of
a
larger
growth
lose
their
dangerous
qualities
on
arriving
at
why
were
our
primary
confiscated
and
our
offending
palms
like
cranmer
visited
with
the
first
penalty
though
we
had
been
obliged
to
walk
blushingly
the
gauntlet
of
fifty
pairs
of
maiden
eyes
and
deliver
to
the
female
principal
of
the
girls
school
across
the
entry
notes
which
we
have
since
but
too
much
reason
to
conclude
bore
no
reference
to
the
affairs
of
the
there
is
a
bit
of
the
always
of
the
nursery
formation
which
we
are
sure
is
discoverable
to
the
true
geologic
eye
in
the
underpinning
of
the
fifth
congregational
society
house
of
worship
then
called
a
now
we
believe
styled
a
church
for
all
sermons
therein
delivered
were
supposed
to
be
for
our
personal
edification
albeit
we
were
not
by
reason
of
our
tender
years
specifically
exposed
to
the
heresies
of
origen
or
pelagius
it
must
have
been
on
some
afternoon
when
we
were
absent
then
that
baxter
delivered
the
discourse
of
which
we
found
a
commentary
written
on
the
of
the
in
our
pew
terribly
tedious
this
is
he
we
have
always
felt
that
a
great
opportunity
was
lost
to
us
we
should
doubtless
have
been
permitted
to
indulge
unchecked
in
the
solution
of
that
lost
mystery
of
our
boyhood
as
to
the
exact
number
of
little
brass
rods
in
the
front
of
the
gallery
to
scratch
our
initials
with
a
pin
upon
the
or
propped
by
the
paternal
arm
to
sweetly
slumber
till
close
no
such
sermon
was
ever
pronounced
in
our
hearing
oh
golden
time
of
youth
precious
season
thus
lost
we
intend
yet
revisiting
that
ancient
and
edifice
and
borrowing
the
keys
of
the
sexton
we
mean
to
revel
in
all
and
sundry
those
delights
of
boyhood
breezy
hour
from
which
we
were
debarred
by
that
untimely
absence
like
the
old
gentleman
who
visited
nightly
van
amburg
exhibition
of
the
feat
in
the
moral
certainty
that
a
single
absence
would
fall
inevitably
upon
the
one
night
when
leo
would
vary
the
programme
by
decapitation
so
we
lost
the
one
afternoon
when
that
dull
discourse
diversified
the
pious
eloquence
of
jotham
baxter
disciple
of
hopkins
and
believer
in
cotton
mather
many
a
refreshing
slumber
has
sealed
our
eyes
under
subsequent
outpourings
of
divinity
but
never
with
that
entire
sense
of
permissible
indulgence
which
then
would
certainly
have
been
ours
why
was
it
except
for
the
that
we
were
always
checked
in
any
notes
and
queries
of
what
we
had
noticed
in
the
sanctuary
why
was
it
wicked
and
deserving
of
a
double
infliction
of
catechism
assembly
for
us
to
have
seen
that
bob
jones
had
a
new
jacket
and
that
he
took
five
marbles
and
a
in
aggravating
display
out
of
its
pockets
while
our
mother
and
sisters
were
enabled
without
let

to
us

all

were
the
consequence
of
those

damaged

disturbed

the

between
the

on

was
about
as
obvious
as
that

must
have
had
a
very
long
road
to
travel
if
it
originated
in
our
nutting

when
we
returned

with
a
ghastly
gash
in
our
the
got
into
our
manual
of
history
for
either
it
or
the
boston
centinel
must
have
made
some
egregious
mistakes

to
the

did

we
have
found
hard
work
to
reconcile
our
faith
as
per
in
the
loveliness
of
those
gentlemen
whom
stress
of
weather
and
a
treacherous
pilot
put
ashore
upon
plymouth
beach
where
they
luckily
found
a
rock
to
step
upon
with
a
certain
sweet
pastoral
called
evangeline
we
found
ourselves
just
after
reading
the
proceedings
of
the
plymouth
monument
association
the
other
day
pondering
over
the
possible
fate
of
the
dutch
colony
of
the
mannahattoes
supposing
that
the
mayflower
had
made
as
was
purposed
the
highlands
of
neversink
instead
of
shankpainter
hill
at
the
end
of
cape
cod
it
was
a
perilous
meditation
for
we
found
our
belief
in
plutarch
lives
the
charter
oak
and
the
existence
of
the
maelström
all
sliding
away
from
under
us
think
we
said
if
new
york
had
been
boston
how
it
would
have
fared
with
the
good
knickerbockers
who
was
our
geographer
why
did
he
insist
upon
our
believing
that
all
french
men
and
women
passed
their
time
in
mutual
bows
and
curchies
and
that
all
italians
were
on
their
knees
to
fat
priests
clean
and
why
did
he
palm
upon
us
that
outrageous
fiction
of
three
kings
like
those
of
cologne
sitting
in
full
ermine
robes
with
gold
crowns
on
their
heads
all
alone
in
a
sort
of
where
the
heat
must
have
been
at
in
the
shade
engaged
in
disparting
poland
we
have
seen
say
a
million
of
frenchmen
and
nearly
the
same
of
italians
since
then
with
a
dozen
or
so
of
kings
and
emperors
but
never
the
faintest
likeness
to
those
deluding
pictures
we
learned
at
the
same
time
by
painful
rote
the
population
of
various
capital
cities
but
we
can
not
find
in
any
gazetteer
neither
in
mcculloch
nor
in
worcester
any
of
the
old
familiar
numbers

in

we
recall
a
sketch
of
a
boy
running
for
life
down
a
slope
of
at
least
just
before
a
snowball
some
five
hundred
times
as
big
as
the
one
our
unitedly
rolled
up
in
the
it
was
a
snowball
round
symmetrical
just
such
a
magnified
copy
of
the
backyard
one
as
might
be
expected
to
follow
a
boy
in
dreams
after
too
much
for
supper
and
that
was
an
avalanche
we
have
stood
since
then
under
the
shadow
of
the
jungfrau
on
the
wengern
alp
at
the
selfsame
spot
where
byron
beheld
the
fall
of
so
many
we
had
the
noble
lord
luck
as
most
people
have
and
saw
dozens
but
not
one
big
snowball
we
believe
there
has
been
reform
since
that
day
thanks
to
the
london
illustrated
news
and
the
penny
magazine
juster
ideas
visit
the
ingenious
youth
of
the
present
age
but
we
solemnly
declare
that
we
grew
up
in
the
belief
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
daily
ushered
to
his
carriage
by
a
long
array
of
bareheaded
and
bowing
menials
and
that
his
official
dress
was
a
cocked
hat
and
we
furthermore
make
affidavit
that
we
supposed
all
the
nobility
of
europe
to
be
in
the
habit
of
driving
over
beggars
and
we
also
depose
and
say
that
we
had
no
other
idea
of
royalty
than
as
continually
clad
in
with
six
peers
in
the
same
with
huge
wigs
as
attendants
all
this
upon
the
faith
of
that
same
was
this
a
pretty
dish
to
set
before
not
a
a
young
republican
who
fancied
himself
the
equal
of
kings
and
lastly
upon
the
same
authority
we
held
that
the
horrible
custom
of
eating
human
flesh
does
not
belong
exclusively
to
any
nation
we
have
seen
we
repeat
men
and
cities
we
have
dined
at
the

from

to

never
yet
upon
any
did
we
encounter

we
repeat

the

or
rather
where
is

not
the
gentle
reader
prepared
to
corroborate
with
many
a
juvenile
reminiscence

by
this

be
prepared
for
our
moral
and
it
is
very
briefly
this
is
it
not
time
to
consider
the
budding
brain
as
entitled
to
fair
play
we
the
dear
people
must
surely
remember
that
it
has
taken
us
much
toil
and
trouble
to
unlearn
many
things
we
know
that
when
we
pen
anything
for
our
coevals
it
is
with
due
attention
to
such
facts
as
we
can
command
that
we
have
a
wholesome
fear
of
criticism
that
if
we
make
blunders
in
our
seamanship
even
though
professedly
some
awful
knickerbocker
stands
by
with
the
marine
dictionary
in
hand
to
pounce
upon
us
but
for
the
poor
little
innocents
at
home
any
rags
of
knowledge
are
good
enough
we
hand
down
to
them
the
platitudes
of
history
which
we
have
carefully
eschewed
we
humbug
their
inexperience
with
the
same
nursery
fables
beneath
whose
leonine
hide
our
matured
vision
detects
the
ears
we
have
been
writing
lightly
enough
but
with
a
purpose
for
absurd
as
may
seem
the
fictions
we
have
sported
with
are
they
not
types
of
many
other
far
more
serious
ones
which
we
cram
down
the
throats
of
our
rising
generation
long
after
we
ourselves
have
begun
to
disbelieve
them
there
is
a
conventional
teaching
which
we
decorously
administer
and
leave
our
pupils
to
disavow
it
when
they
can

chapter
it
was
a
comfort
to
get
to
a
place
with
something
like
society
with
residences
which
had
pretensions
to
elegance
with
people
of
some
breeding
with
a
newspaper
and
stores
to
advertise
in
it
and
with
two
or
three
churches
to
keep
each
other
alive
by
wholesome
agitation
rockland
was
such
a
place
some
of
the
natural
features
of
the
town
have
been
described
already
the
mountain
of
course
was
what
gave
it
its
character
and
redeemed
it
from
wearing
the
commonplace
expression
which
belongs
to
ordinary
beautiful
wild
invested
with
the
mystery
which
belongs
to
untrodden
spaces
and
with
enough
of
terror
to
give
it
dignity
it
had
yet
closer
relations
with
the
town
over
which
it
brooded
than
the
passing
stranger
knew
of
thus
it
made
a
local
climate
by
cutting
off
the
northern
winds
and
holding
the
sun
heat
like
a
which
on
the
northern
side
of
the
mountain
hardly
ever
came
to
fruit
ripened
abundant
crops
in
rockland
but
there
was
still
another
relation
between
the
mountain
and
the
town
at
its
foot
which
strangers
were
not
likely
to
hear
alluded
to
and
which
was
oftener
thought
of
than
spoken
of
by
its
inhabitants
those
forests
hangers
as
white
of

would
have
called
them
sloping
far
upward
and
backward
into
the
distance

always
an
air
of
menace
blended
with
their
wild
beauty
it
seemed
as
if
some
titan
had
thrown
his
shaggy
robe
over
the
bare
precipitous
flanks
of
the
rocky
summit
and
it
might
at
any
moment
slide
like
a
garment
flung
carelessly
on
the
nearest
and
so
sliding
crush
the
village
out
of
being
as
the
rossberg
when
it
tumbled
over
on
the
valley
of
goldau
persons
have
been
known
to
remove
from
the
place
after
a
short
residence
in
it
because
they
were
haunted
day
and
night
by
the
thought
of
this
awful
green
wall
piled
up
into
the
air
over
their
heads
they
would
lie
awake
of
nights
thinking
they
heard
the
muffled
snapping
of
roots
as
if
a
thousand
acres
of
the
were
tugging
to
break
away
like
the
snow
from
a
and
a
hundred
thousand
trees
were
clinging
with
all
their
fibres
to
hold
back
the
soil
just
ready
to
peel
away
and
crash
down
with
all
its
rocks
and
and
yet
by
one
of
those
strange
contradictions
we
are
constantly
finding
in
human
nature
there
were
natives
of
the
town
who
would
come
back
thirty
or
forty
years
after
leaving
it
just
to
nestle
under
this
same
threatening
as
old
men
sun
themselves
against
walls
the
old
dreams
and
legends
of
danger
added
to
the
attraction
if
the
mountain
should
ever
slide
they
had
a
kind
of
feeling
as
if
they
ought
to
be
there
it
was
a
fascination
like
that
which
the
rattlesnake
is
said
to
exert
this
comparison
naturally
suggests
the
recollection
of
that
other
source
of
danger
which
was
an
element
in
the
everyday
life
of
the
rockland
people
the
folks
in
some
of
the
neighboring
towns
had
a
joke
against
them
that
a
rocklander
could
hear
a
rattle
without
saying
the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
it
is
very
true
that
many
a
nervous
old
lady
has
had
a
terrible
start
caused
by
some
mischievous
young
giving
a
sudden
shake
to
one
of
these
noisy
vegetable
products
in
her
immediate
vicinity
yet
strangely
enough
many
persons
missed
the
excitement
of
the
possibility
of
a
fatal
bite
in
other
regions
where
there
were
nothing
but
black
and
green
and
striped
snakes
mean
ophidians
having
the
spite
of
the
nobler
serpent
without
his
venom
poor
crawling
creatures
whom
nature
would
not
trust
with
a
many
natives
of
rockland
did
unquestionably
experience
a
certain
gratification
in
this
infinitesimal
sense
of
danger
it
was
noted
that
the
old
people
retained
their
hearing
longer
than
in
other
places
some
said
it
was
the
softened
climate
but
others
believed
it
was
owing
to
the
habit
of
keeping
their
ears
open
whenever
they
were
walking
through
the
grass
or
in
the
woods
at
any
rate
a
slight
sense
of
danger
is
often
an
agreeable
stimulus
people
sip
their
de
with
a
peculiar
tremulous
pleasure
because
there
is
a
bare
possibility
that
it
may
contain
prussic
acid
enough
to
knock
them
over
in
which
case
they
will
lie
as
dead
as
if
a
had
emptied
itself
into
the
earth
through
their
brain
and
marrow
but
rockland
had
other
features
which
helped
to
give
it
a
special
character
first
of
all
there
was
one
grand
street
which
was
its
chief
glory
elm
street
it
was
called
naturally
enough
for
its
elms
made
a
long
gallery
of
it
through
most
of
its
extent
no
natural
gothic
arch
compares
for
a
moment
with
that
formed
by
two
american
elms
where
their
lofty
jets
of
foliage
shoot
across
each
other
ascending
curves
to
intermingle
their
showery
flakes
of
green
when
one
looks
through
a
long
double
row
of
these
as
in
that
lovely
avenue
which
the
poets
of
yale
remember
so
well
oh
could
the
vista
of
my
life
but
now
as
bright
appear
as
when
i
first
through
temple
street
looked
down
thine
espalier
he
beholds
a
temple
not
built
with
hands
fairer
than
any
minster
with
all
its
clustered
stems
and
flowering
capitals
that
ever
grew
in
stone
nobody
knows
new
england
who
is
not
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
one
of
its
elms
the
elm
comes
nearer
to
having
a
soul
than
any
other
vegetable
creature
among
us
it
loves
man
as
man
loves
it
it
is
modest
and
patient
it
has
a
small
flake
of
a
seed
which
blows
in
everywhere
and
makes
arrangements
for
coming
up
so
in
spring
one
finds
a
crop
of
among
his
carrots
and
parsnips
very
weak
and
small
compared
to
those
succulent
vegetables
the
die
most
of
them
slain
unrecognized
or
unheeded
by
hand
or
hoe
as
meekly
as
herod
innocents
one
of
them
gets
overlooked
perhaps
until
it
has
established
a
kind
of
right
to
stay
three
generations
of
carrot
and
have
passed
away
yourself
among
them
and
now
let
your
look
for
the
feet
of
clean
girth
three
hundred
and
sixty
feet
in
the
line
that
bounds
its
leafy
circle
it
covers
the
boy
with
such
a
canopy
as
neither
oak
nor
linden
ever
lifted
into
the
summer
skies
elm
street
was
the
pride
of
rockland
but
not
only
on
account
of
its
vista
in
this
street
were
most
of
the
great
houses
or
as
it
was
usual
to
call
them
along
this
street
also
the
more
nicely
kept
and
neatly
painted
dwellings
were
chiefly
congregated
it
was
the
correct
thing
for
a
rockland
dignitary
to
have
a
house
in
elm

a
new

with

the
old

of
the

only
on
a
somewhat
grander
scale
is
sir
thomas
place
where
dear
good
watts
said
prayers
for
the
family
and
wrote
those
blessed
hymns
of
his
that
sing
us
into
consciousness
in
our
cradles
and
come
back
to
us
in
sweet
single
verses
between
the
momenta
of
wandering
and
of
stupor
when
we
lie
dying
and
sound
over
us
when
we
can
no
longer
hear
them
bringing
grateful
tears
to
the
hot
aching
eyes
beneath
the
thick
black
veils
and
carrying
the
holy
calm
with
them
which
filled
the
good
man

as
he
prayed
and
sung
under
the
shelter
of
the
old
english
next
to
the
came
the
trim
genteel
houses
which
being
more
gossipy
and
less
nicely
bred
crowded
close
up
to
the
street
instead
of
standing
back
from
it
with
arms
akimbo
like
the
their
little
were
very
commonly
full
of
lilac
and
syringa
and
other
bushes
which
were
allowed
to
smother
the
lower
story
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
light
and
air
so
that
what
with
small
windows
and
small
windowpanes
and
the
darkness
made
by
these
choking
growths
of
shrubbery
the
front
parlors
of
some
of
these
houses
were
the
most
melancholy
places
that
could
be
found
anywhere
among
the
abodes
of
the
living
their
garnishing
was
apt
to
assist
this
impression
carpets
which
always
look
discontented
in
little
rooms
furniture
black
and
shiny
as
beetles
and
with
a
sullen
of
the
kind
called
astral
by
our
imaginative
ancestors
in
the
centre
these
things
were
inevitable
in
set
piles
round
the
lamp
was
ranged
the
current
literature
of
the
day
in
the
form
of
temperance
documents
unbound
numbers
of
one
of
the
unknown
public
magazines
with
steel
engravings
and
the
poems
of
a
distinguished
british
author
whom
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
a
volume
of
sermons
or
a
novel
or
two
or
both
according
to
the
tastes
of
the
family
and
the
good

which
is
always

the
cheapest
and
commonest

of

the
others
according
to
politics
and
other
tendencies
this
intermediate
class
of
houses
wherever
one
finds
them
in
new
england
towns
are
very
apt
to
be
cheerless
and
unsatisfactory
they
have
neither
the
luxury
of
the
nor
the
comfort
of
the
they
are
rarely
kept
at
an
agreeable
temperature
the
has
large
fireplaces
and
generous
chimneys
and
is
open
to
the
sunshine
the
makes
no
pretensions
but
it
has
a
good
warm
kitchen
at
any
rate
and
one
can
be
comfortable
there
with
the
rest
of
the
family
without
fear
and
without
reproach
these
lesser
of
genteel
aspirations
are
much
given
to
patent
subterfuges
of
one
kind
and
another
to
get
heat
without
combustion
the
chilly
parlor
and
the
slippery
seat
take
the
life
out
of
the
warmest
welcome
if
one
would
make
these
places
wholesome
happy
and
cheerful
the
first
precept
would
be
the
dearest
fuel
plenty
of
it
and
let
half

go
up

chimney
if
you

afford
this
try
to
live
in
a
genteel
fashion
but
stick
to
the
ways
of
the
honest
there
were
a
good
many
comfortable
scattered
about
rockland
the
best
of
them
were
something
of
the
following
pattern
which
is
too
often
superseded
of
late
by
a
more
pretentious
but
infinitely
less
pleasing
kind
of
rustic
architecture
a
little
back
from
the
road
seated
directly
on
the
green
sod
rose
a
plain
wooden
building
two
stories
in
front
with
a
long
roof
sloping
backwards
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
ground
this
like
the
is
copied
from
an
old
english
pattern
cottages
of
this
model
may
be
seen
in
lancashire
for
instance
always
with
the
same
honest
homely
look
as
if
their
roofs
acknowledged
their
relationship
to
the
soil
out
of
which
they
sprung
the
walls
were
unpainted
but
turned
by
the
slow
action
of
sun
and
air
and
rain
to
a
quiet
or
an
old
broken
stone
at
the
door
a
pointing
like
a
finger
to
the
heavens
which
the
shining
round
of
water
beneath
looked
up
at
like
a
dark
unsleeping
eye
a
single
large
elm
a
little
at
one
side
a
barn
twice
as
big
as
the
house
a
with
the
white
horns
tossing
above
the
wall
some
fields
in
pasture
or
in
crops
with
low
stone
walls
round
them
a
row
of
beehives
a
with
roots
and
and
and
seedling
onions
and
marigolds
and
and
and
peonies
crowding
in
together
with
southernwood
in
the
borders
and
woodbine
and
hops
and
climbing
as
they
got
a
chance
these
were
the
features
by
which
the
children
remembered
the
when
they
had
grown
to
be
men
such
are
the
recollections
that
come
over
poor
crawling
out
on
reeling
yards
to
reef
topsails
as
their
vessels
stagger
round
the
stormy
cape
and
such
are
the
flitting
images
that
make
the
eyes
of
old
merchants
look
dim
and
dreamy
as
they
sit
in
their
city
palaces
warm
with
the
flush
of
the
red
wave
out
of
which
memory
arises
as
aphrodite
arose
from
the
green
waves
of
the
ocean
two
stood
on
two
eminences
facing
each
other
and
looking
like
a
couple
of
with
their
necks
straight
up
in
the
air
as
if
they
would
flap
their
roofs
the
next
thing
and
crow
out
of
their
upstretched
steeples
and
peck
at
each
other
glass
eyes
with
their
weathercocks
the
first
was
a
good
pattern
of
the
real
new
england
it
was
a
large
barn
with
windows
fronted
by
a
square
tower
crowned
with
a
kind
of
wooden
bell
inverted
and
raised
on
legs
out
of
which
rose
a
slender
spire
with
the
weathercock
at
its
summit
inside
tall
square
pews
with
flapping
seats
and
a
gallery
running
round
three
sides
of
the
building
on
the
fourth
side
the
pulpit
with
a
huge
dusty
hanging
over
it
here
preached
the
reverend
pierrepont
honeywood
successor
after
a
number
of
generations
to
the
office
and
the
parsonage
of
the
reverend
didymus
bean
before
mentioned
but
not
suspected
of
any
of
his
alleged
heresies
he
held
to
the
old
faith
of
the
puritans
and
occasionally
delivered
a
discourse
which
was
considered
by
the
theologians
of
his
parish
to
have
settled
the
whole
matter
fully
and
finally
so
that
now
there
was
a
good
logical
basis
laid
down
for
the
millennium
which
might
begin
at
once
upon
the
platform
of
his
demonstrations
yet
the
reverend
honeywood
was
fonder
of
preaching
plain
practical
sermons
about
the
duties
of
life
and
showing
his
christianity
in
abundant
good
works
among
his
people
it
was
noticed
by
some
few
of
his
flock
not
without
comment
that
the
great
majority
of
his
texts
came
from
the
gospels
and
this
more
and
more
as
he
became
interested
in
various
benevolent
enterprises
which
brought
him
into
relations
with
ministers
and
laymen
of
other
denominations
the
truth
is
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
very
warm
open
and
exceedingly
disposition
and
although
bred
by
a
clerical
father
whose
motto
was
anima
mea
cum
he
exercised
his
human
faculties
in
the
harness
of
his
ancient
faith
with
such
freedom
that
the
straps
of
it
got
so
loose
they
did
not
interfere
greatly
with
the
circulation
of
the
warm
blood
through
his
system
once
in
a
while
he
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
to
come
out
with
a
grand
doctrinal
sermon
and
then
he
would
lapse
away
for
while
into
preaching
on
men
duties
to
each
other
and
to
society
and
hit
hard
perhaps
at
some
of
the
actual
vices
of
the
time
and
place
and
insist
with
such
tenderness
and
eloquence
on
the
great
depth
and
breadth
of
true
christian
love
and
charity
that
his
oldest
deacon
shook
his
head
and
wished
he
had
shown
as
much
interest
when
he
was
preaching
three
sabbaths
back
on
predestination
or
in
his
discourse
against
the
sabellians
but
he
was
sound
in
the
faith
no
doubt
of
that
did
he
not
preside
at
the
council
held
in
the
town
of
tamarack
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
which
expelled
its
clergyman
for
maintaining
heretical
doctrines
as
presiding
officer
he
did
not
vote
to
be
sure
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
all
right
he
had
some
of
the
edwards
blood
in
him
and
that
very
well
let
him
go
wrong
the
on
the
other
and
opposite
summit
was
of
a
more
modern
style
considered
by
many
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
new
england
model
so
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
country
parish
to
pull
down
its
old
which
has
been
preached
in
for
a
hundred
years
or
so
and
put
up
one
of
these
more
elegant
edifices
the
new
building
was
in
what
may
be
called
the
florid
manner
its
pinnacles
and
crockets
and
other
ornaments
were
like
the
body
of
the
building
all
of
pine
wood
an
admirable
material
as
it
is
very
soft
and
easily
worked
and
can
be
painted
of
any
color
desired
inside
the
walls
were
stuccoed
in
imitation
of
stone
first
a
square
then
two
squares
then
another
square
and
so
on
to
represent
the
accidental
differences
of
shade
always
noticeable
in
the
real
stones
of
which
walls
are
built
to
be
sure
the
architect
could
not
help
getting
his
squares
in
almost
as
regular
rhythmical
order
as
those
of
a
but
nobody
can
avoid
doing
things
in
a
systematic
and
serial
way
indeed
people
who
wish
to
plant
trees
in
natural
clumps
know
very
well
that
they
can
not
keep
from
making
regular
lines
and
symmetrical
figures
unless
by
some
trick
or
other
as
that
one
of
throwing
up
into
the
air
a
peck
of
potatoes
and
sticking
in
a
tree
wherever
a
potato
happens
to
fall
the
pews
of
this
were
the
usual
oblong
ones
where
people
sit
close
together
with
a
ledge
before
them
to
support
their
liable
only
to
occasional
contact
with
the
back
of
the
next
pew
heads
or
bonnets
and
a
place
running
under
the
seat
of
that
pew
where
hats
could
be
deposited
always
at
the
risk
of
the
owner
in
case
of
injury
by
boots
or
crickets
in
this
preached
the
reverend
chauncy
fairweather
a
divine
of
the
liberal
school
as
it
is
commonly
called
bred
at
that
famous
college
which
used
to
be
thought
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
to
have
the
monopoly
of
training
young
men
in
the
milder
forms
of
heresy
his
ministrations
were
attended
with
decency
but
not
followed
with
enthusiasm
the
beauty
of
virtue
got
to
be
an
old
story
at
last
the
moral
dignity
of
human
nature
ceased
to
excite
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
after
some
hundred
repetitions
it
grew
to
be
a
dull
business
this
preaching
against
stealing
and
intemperance
while
he
knew
very
well
that
the
thieves
were
prowling
round
orchards
and
empty
houses
instead
of
being
there
to
hear
the
sermon
and
that
the
drunkards
being
rarely
get
little
good
by
the
statistics
and
eloquent
appeals
of
the
preacher
every
now
and
then
however
the
reverend
fairweather
let
off
a
polemic
discourse
against
his
neighbor
opposite
which
waked
his
people
up
a
little
but
it
was
a
languid
congregation
at
best
very
apt
to
stay
away
from
meeting
in
the
afternoon
and
not
at
all
given
to
extra
evening
services
the
minister
unlike
his
rival
of
the
other
side
of
the
way
was
a
and
timid
kind
of
man
he
went
on
preaching
as
he
had
been
taught
to
preach
but
he
bad
misgivings
at
times
there
was
a
little
roman
catholic
church
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
his
own
was
placed
which
he
always
had
to
pass
on
sundays
he
could
never
look
on
the
thronging
multitudes
that
crowded
its
pews
and
aisles
or
knelt
on
its
steps
without
a
longing
to
get
in
among
them
and
go
down
on
his
knees
and
enjoy
that
luxury
of
devotional
contact
which
makes
a
worshipping
throng
as
different
from
the
same
numbers
praying
apart
as
a
bed
of
coals
is
from
a
trail
of
scattered
cinders
oh
if
i
could
but
huddle
in
with
those
poor
laborers
and
he
would
say
to
himself
if
i
could
but
breathe
that
atmosphere
stifling
though
it
be
yet
made
holy
by
ancient
litanies
and
cloudy
with
the
smoke
of
hallowed
incense
for
one
hour
instead
of
droning
over
these
moral
precepts
to
my
congregation
the
intellectual
isolation
of
his
sect
preyed
upon
him
for
of
all
the
terrible
things
to
natures
like
his
the
most
terrible
is
to
belong
to
a
minority
no
person
that
looked
at
his
thin
and
sallow
cheek
his
sunken
and
sad
eye
his
tremulous
lip
his
contracted
forehead
or
who
heard
his
querulous
though
not
unmusical
voice
could
fail
to
see
that
his
life
was
an
uneasy
one
that
he
was
engaged
in
some
inward
conflict
his
dark
melancholic
aspect
contrasted
with
his
seemingly
cheerful
creed
and
was
all
the
more
striking
as
the
worthy
honeywood
professing
a
belief
which
made
him
a
passenger
on
board
a
shipwrecked
planet
was
yet
a
most
and
companionable
gentleman
whose
laugh
on
did
one
as
much
good
to
listen
to
as
the
best
sermon
he
ever
delivered
on
a
sunday
a
few
miles
from
rockland
was
a
pretty
little
episcopal
church
with
a
roof
like
a
wedge
of
cheese
a
square
tower
a
stained
window
and
a
trained
rector
who
read
the
service
with
such
ventral
depth
of
utterance
and
rrreduplication
of
the
rrresonant
letter
that
his
own
mother
would
not
have
known
him
for
her
son
if
the
good
woman
had
not
ironed
his
surplice
and
put
it
on
with
her
own
hands
there
were
two
in
the
place
one
dignified
with
the
name
of
the
mountain
house
somewhat
frequented
by
in
the
summer
months
balconied
boasting
a
distinct
and
spreading
a
of
some
pretensions
the
other
pollard
tahvern
in
the
common
speech
a
building
with
a
once
famous
where
there
was
a
great
smell
of
hay
and
boots
and
pipes
and
all
other
elements
where
games
of
checkers
were
played
on
the
back
of
the
bellows
with
red
and
white
kernels
of
corn
or
with
beans
and
coffee
where
a
man
slept
in
a
at
night
to
wake
up
early
passengers
where
teamsters
came
in
with
whips
and
coarse
frocks
reinforcing
the
bucolic
flavor
of
the
atmosphere
and
male
gossips
sometimes
including
the
squire
of
the
neighboring
gathered
to
exchange
a
question
or
two
about
the
news
and
then
fall
into
that
solemn
state
of
suspended
animation
which
the
temperance
of
modern
days
produce
on
human
beings
as
the
grotta
del
cane
does
on
dogs
in
the
experiments
related
by
travellers
this
used
to
be
famous
for
drinking
and
and
sometimes
fighting
in
old
times
that
was
when
there
were
rows
of
decanters
on
the
shelf
behind
the
bar
and
a
hissing
vessel
of
hot
water
ready
to
make
punch
and
three
or
four
long
irons
clubbed
at
the
end
were
always
lying
in
the
fire
in
the
cold
season
waiting
to
be
plunged
into
sputtering
and
foaming
mugs
of
flip
goodly
compound
speaking
according
to
the
flesh
made
with
beer
and
sugar
and
a
certain
suspicion
of
strong
waters
over
which
a
little
nutmeg
being
grated
and
in
it
the
hot
iron
being

allowed
to
sizzle
there
results
a
peculiar
singed
aroma
which
the
wise
regard
as
a
warning
to
remove
themselves
at
once
out
of
the
reach
of
temptation
but
the
bar
of
pollard
tahvern
no
longer
presented
its
old
attractions
and
the
loggerheads
had
long
disappeared
from
the
fire
in
place
of
the
decanters
were
boxes
containing
lozengers
as
they
were
commonly
called
sticks
of
candy
in
jars
cigars
in
tumblers
a
few
lemons
grown
and
marvellously
shrunken
by
long
exposure
but
still
feebly
suggestive
of
possible
lemonade
the
whole
ornamented
by
festoons
of
yellow
and
blue
cut
on
the
front
shelf
of
the
bar
stood
a
large
pitcher
of
water
and
scattered
about
were
lamps
with
wicks
that
always
wanted
picking
which
burned
red
and
smoked
a
good
deal
and
were
apt
to
go
out
without
any
obvious
cause
leaving
strong
reminiscences
of
the
in
the
circumambient
air
the
common
of
rockland
were
dwarfed
by
the
grandeur
of
the
apollinean
institute
the
master
passed
one
of
them
in
a
walk
he
was
taking
soon
after
his
arrival
at
rockland
he
looked
in
at
the
rows
of
desks
and
recalled
his
late
experiences
he
could
not
help
laughing
as
he
thought
how
neatly
he
had
knocked
the
young
butcher
off
his
pins
little
is
a
dangerous
thing
as
well
as
a
little
he
said
to
himself
only
dangerous
to
the
fellow
you
try
it
on
and
he
cut
him
a
good
stick
and
began
climbing
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
get
a
look
at
that
famous
rattlesnake

the
sunbeam
and
the
shadow
the
virtue
of
the
world
is
not
mainly
in
its
leaders
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
which
follows
there
is
often
something
better
than
in
the
one
that
goes
before
old
generals
wanted
to
take
toulon
but
one
of
their
young
colonels
showed
them
how
the
junior
counsel
has
been
known
not
unfrequently
to
make
a
better
argument
than
his
senior
fellow
if
indeed
he
did
not
make
both
their
arguments
good
ministers
will
tell
you
they
have
parishioners
who
beat
them
in
the
practice
of
the
virtues
a
great
establishment
got
up
on
commercial
principles
like
the
apollinean
institute
might
yet
be
well
carried
on
if
it
happened
to
get
good
teachers
and
when
master
langdon
came
to
see
its
management
he
recognized
that
there
must
be
fidelity
and
intelligence
somewhere
among
the
instructors
it
was
only
necessary
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
fair
open
forehead
the
still
tranquil
eye
of
gentle
habitual
authority
the
sweet
gravity
that
lay
upon
the
lips
to
hear
the
clear
answers
to
the
pupils
questions
to
notice
how
every
request
had
the
force
without
the
form
of
a
command
and
the
young
man
could
not
doubt
that
the
good
genius
of
the
school
stood
before
him
in
the
person
of
helen
darley
it
was
the
old
story
a
poor
dies
and
leaves
a
widow
and
a
daughter
in
old
england
the
daughter
would
have
eaten
the
bitter
bread
of
a
governess
in
some
rich
family
in
new
england
she
must
keep
a
school
so
rising
from
one
sphere
to
another
she
at
length
finds
herself
the
in
the
department
of
instruction
in
silas
peckham
educational
establishment
what
a
miserable
thing
it
is
to
be
poor
she
was
dependent
frail
sensitive
conscientious
she
was
in
the
power
of
a
hard
grasping
trading
educator
who
neither
knew
nor
cared
for
a
tender
woman
sensibilities
but
who
paid
her
and
meant
to
have
his
money
worth
out
of
her
brains
and
as
much
more
than
his
worth
as
he
could
get
she
was
consequently
in
plain
english
overworked
and
an
overworked
woman
is
always
a
sad
sight
sadder
a
great
deal
than
an
overworked
man
because
she
is
so
much
more
fertile
in
capacities
of
suffering
than
a
man
she
has
so
many
varieties
of
headache
sometimes
as
if
jael
were
driving
the
nail
that
killed
sisera
into
her
temples
sometimes
letting
her
work
with
half
her
brain
while
the
other
half
throbs
as
if
it
would
go
to
pieces
sometimes
tightening
round
the
brows
as
if
her
were
luke
iron
crown
and
then
her
neuralgias
and
her
and
her
fits
of
depression
in
which
she
thinks
she
is
nothing
and
less
than
nothing
and
those
paroxysms
which
men
speak
slightingly
of
as
hysterical
convulsions
that
is
all
only
not
commonly
fatal
ones
so
many
trials
which
belong
to
her
fine
and
mobile
structure
that
she
is
always
entitled
to
pity
when
she
is
placed
in
conditions
which
develop
her
nervous
tendencies
the
poor
teacher
work
had
of
course
been
doubled
since
the
departure
of
langdon
predecessor
nobody
knows
what
the
weariness
of
instruction
is
as
soon
as
the
teacher
faculties
begin
to
be
overtasked
but
those
who
have
tried
it
the
of
fresh
pupils
each
new
set
with
its
exhausting
powers
in
full
action
coming
one
after
another
take
out
all
the
reserved
forces
and
faculties
of
resistance
from
the
subject
of
their
draining
process
the
day
work
was
over
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
she
sat
down
tired
and
faint
with
a
great
bundle
of
girls
themes
or
compositions
to
read
over
before
she
could
rest
her
weary
head
on
the
pillow
of
her
narrow
and
forget
for
a
while
the
treadmill
stair
of
labor
she
was
daily
climbing
how
she
dreaded
this
most
forlorn
of
all
a
teacher
tasks
she
was
conscientious
in
her
duties
and
would
insist
on
reading
every
sentence
there
was
no
saying
where
she
might
find
faults
of
grammar
or
bad
spelling
there
might
but
have
been
twenty
or
thirty
of
these
themes
in
the
bundle
before
her
of
course
she
knew
pretty
well
the
leading
sentiments
they
could
contain
that
beauty
was
subject
to
the
accidents
of
time
that
wealth
was
inconstant
and
existence
uncertain
that
virtue
was
its
own
reward
that
youth
exhaled
like
the
from
the
flower
ere
the
sun
had
reached
its
meridian
that
life
was
with
trials
that
the
lessons
of
virtue
instilled
by
our
beloved
teachers
were
to
be
our
guides
through
all
our
future
career
the
imagery
employed
consisted
principally
of
roses
lilies
birds
clouds
and
brooks
with
the
celebrated
comparison
of
wayward
genius
to
a
meteor
who
does
not
know
the
small
slanted
italian
hand
of
these
their
stringing
together
of
the
good
old
traditional
phrases
their
occasional
gushes
of
sentiment
the
profound
estimates
of
the
world
sounding
to
the
old
folks
that
read
them
as
the
experience
of
a
young
one
with
the
chips
of
its
shell
on
its
head
would
sound
to
a
mother
chicken
who
knew
the
great
ocean
with
all
its
typhoons
and
tornadoes
yet
every
now
and
then
one
is
liable
to
be
surprised
with
strange
clairvoyant
flashes
that
can
hardly
be
explained
except
by
the
mysterious
inspiration
which
every
now
and
then
seizes
a
young
girl
and
exalts
her
intelligence
just
as
hysteria
in
other
instances
exalts
the
sensibility
a
little
something
of
that
which
made
joan
of
arc
and
the
burney
girl
who
prophesied
evelina
and
the
davidson
sisters
in
the
midst
of
these
commonplace
exercises
which
miss
darley
read
over
so
carefully
were
two
or
three
that
had
something
of
individual
flavor
about
them
and
here
and
there
there
was
an
image
or
an
epithet
which
showed
the
footprint
of
a
passionate
nature
as
a
fallen
scarlet
feather
marks
the
path
the
wild
flamingo
has
trodden
the
young
lady
teacher
read
them
with
a
certain
indifference
of
manner
as
one
reads
proofs
noting
defects
of
detail
but
not
commonly
arrested
by
the
matters
treated
of
even
miss
charlotte
ann
wood
poem
beginning
how
sweet
at
evening
balmy
hour
did
not
excite
her
she
marked
the
inevitable
false
rhyme
of
cockney
and
yankee
beginners
and
and
tossed
the
verses
on
the
pile
of
those
she
had
finished
she
was
looking
over
some
of
the
last
of
them
in
a
rather
listless
way
for
the
poor
thing
was
getting
sleepy
in
spite
of
herself
when
she
came
to
one
which
seemed
to
rouse
her
attention
and
lifted
her
drooping
lids
she
looked
at
it
a
moment
before
she
would
touch
it
then
she
took
hold
of
it
by
one
corner
and
slid
it
off
from
the
rest
one
would
have
said
she
was
afraid
of
it
or
had
some
undefined
antipathy
which
made
it
hateful
to
her
such
odd
fancies
are
common
enough
in
young
persons
in
her
nervous
state
many
of
these
young
people
will
jump
up
twenty
times
a
day
and
run
to
dabble
the
tips
of
their
fingers
in
water
after
touching
the
most
inoffensive
objects
this
composition
was
written
in
a
singular
long
slender
hand
on
a
kind
of
wavy
ribbed
paper
there
was
something
strangely
suggestive
about
the
look
of
it
but
exactly
of
what
miss
darley
either
could
not
or
did
not
try
to
think
the
subject
of
the
paper
was
the
mountain
the
composition
being
a
sort
of
descriptive
rhapsody
it
showed
a
startling
familiarity
with
some
of
the
savage
scenery
of
the
region
one
would
have
said
that
the
writer
must
have
threaded
its
wildest
solitudes
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
stars
as
well
as
by
day
as
the
teacher
read
on
her
color
changed
and
a
kind
of
tremulous
agitation
came
over
her
there
were
hints
in
this
strange
paper
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
there
was
something
in
its
descriptions
and
imagery
that
recalled
miss
darley
could
not
say
what
but
it
made
her
frightfully
nervous
still
she
could
not
help
reading
till
she
came
to
one
passage
which
so
agitated
her
that
the
tired
and
overwearied
girl
left
her
entirely
she
sobbed
once
or
twice
then
laughed
convulsively
and
flung
herself
on
the
bed
where
she
worked
out
a
set
hysteric
spasm
as
she
best
might
without
anybody
to
rub
her
hands
and
see
that
she
did
not
hurt
herself
she
got
quiet
rose
and
went
to
her
bookcase
took
down
a
volume
of
coleridge
and
read
a
short
time
and
so
to
bed
to
sleep
and
wake
from
time
to
time
with
a
sudden
start
out
of
uneasy
dreams
perhaps
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
what
it
was
in
the
composition
which
set
her
off
into
this
nervous
paroxysm
she
was
in
such
a
state
that
almost
any
slight
agitation
would
have
brought
on
the
attack
and
it
was
the
accident
of
her
transient
excitability
very
probably
which
made
a
trifling
cause
the
seeming
occasion
of
so
much
disturbance
the
theme
was
signed
in
the
same
peculiar
sharp
slender
hand
and
was
of
course
written
by
that
girl
who
had
excited
the
master
curiosity
and
prompted
his
question
as
before
mentioned
the
next
morning
the
looked
pale
and
wearied
naturally
enough
but
she
was
in
her
place
at
the
usual
hour
and
master
langdon
in
his
own
the
girls
had
not
yet
entered
the
schoolroom
you
have
been
ill
i
am
afraid
said
bernard
i
was
not
well
yesterday
she
answered
i
had
a
worry
and
a
kind
of
fright
it
is
so
dreadful
to
have
the
charge
of
all
these
young
souls
and
bodies
every
young
girl
ought
to
walk
locked
close
arm
in
arm
between
two
guardian
angels
sometimes
i
faint
almost
with
the
thought
of
all
that
i
ought
to
do
and
of
my
own
weakness
and
wants
tell
me
are
there
not
natures
born
so
out
of
parallel
with
the
lines
of
natural
law
that
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
can
bring
them
right
bernard
had
speculated
somewhat
as
all
thoughtful
persons
of
his
profession
are
forced
to
do
on
the
innate
organic
tendencies
with
which
individuals
families
and
races
are
born
he
replied
therefore
with
a
smile
as
one
to
whom
the
question
suggested
a
very
familiar
class
of
facts
why
of
course
each
of
us
is
only
of
a
double
column
of
figures
that
goes
back
to
the
first
pair
every
unit
tells
and
some
of
them
are
and
some
if
the
columns
do
add
up
right
it
is
commonly
because
we
ca
make
out
all
the
figures
i
do
mean
to
say
that
something
may
not
be
added
by
nature
to
make
up
for
losses
and
keep
the
race
to
its
average
but
we
are
mainly
nothing
but
the
answer
to
a
long
sum
in
addition
and
subtraction
no
doubt
there
are
people
born
with
impulses
at
every
possible
angle
to
the
parallels
of
nature
as
you
call
them
if
they
happen
to
cut
these
at
right
angles
of
course
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
common
influences
slight
obliquities
are
what
we
have
most
to
do
with
in
education
penitentiaries
and
insane
asylums
take
care
of
most
of
the
i
am
afraid
i
have
put
it
too
much
like
a
professor
and
i
am
only
a
student
you
know
pray
what
set
you
the
next
morning
the
took
to
asking
me
this
any
strange
cases
among
the
scholars
the
meek
teacher
blue
eyes
met
the
luminous
glance
that
came
with
the
question
she
too
was
of
gentle
blood
not
meaning
by
that
that
she
was
of
any
noted
lineage
but
that
she
came
of
a
cultivated
stock
never
rich
but
long
trained
to
intellectual
callings
a
thousand
decencies
amenities
reticences
graces
which
no
one
thinks
of
until
he
misses
them
are
the
traditional
right
of
those
who
spring
from
such
families
and
when
two
persons
of
this
exceptional
breeding
meet
in
the
midst
of
the
common
multitude
they
seek
each
other
company
at
once
by
the
natural
law
of
elective
affinity
it
is
wonderful
how
men
and
women
know
their
peers
if
two
stranger
queens
sole
survivors
of
two
vessels
were
cast
on
a
rock
together
each
would
at
once
address
the
other
as
our
royal
sister
helen
darley
looked
into
the
dark
eyes
of
bernard
langdon
glittering
with
the
light
which
flashed
from
them
with
his
question
not
as
those
foolish
innocent
of
the
small
village
did
she
look
into
them
to
be
fascinated
and
bewildered
but
to
sound
them
with
a
calm
steadfast
purpose
a
gentleman
she
said
to
herself
as
she
read
his
expression
and
his
features
with
a
woman
rapid
but
exhausting
glance
a
lady
he
said
to
himself
as
he
met
her
questioning
look
so
brief
so
quiet
yet
so
assured
as
of
one
whom
necessity
had
taught
to
read
faces
quickly
without
offence
as
children
read
the
faces
of
parents
as
wives
read
the
faces
of
husbands
all
this
was
but
a
few
seconds
work
and
yet
the
main
point
was
settled
if
there
had
been
any
vulgar
curiosity
or
coarseness
of
any
kind
lurking
in
his
expression
she
would
have
detected
it
if
she
had
not
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
so
softly
and
kept
them
there
so
calmly
and
withdrawn
them
so
quietly
he
would
not
have
said
to
himself
she
is
a
for
that
word
meant
a
good
deal
to
the
descendant
of
the
courtly
wentworths
and
the
scholarly
langdons
there
are
strange
people
everywhere
langdon
she
said
and
i
do
think
our
is
an
exception
i
am
glad
you
believe
in
the
force
of
transmitted
tendencies
it
would
break
my
heart
if
i
did
not
think
that
there
are
faults
beyond
the
reach
of
everything
but
god
special
grace
i
should
die
if
i
thought
that
my
negligence
or
incapacity
was
alone
responsible
for
the
errors
and
sins
of
those
i
have
charge
of
yet
there
are
mysteries
i
do
not
know
how
to
account
for
she
looked
all
round
the
and
then
said
in
a
whisper
langdon
we
had
a
girl
that
in
the
school
not
long
ago
worse
than
that
we
had
a
girl
that
tried
to
set
us
on
fire
children
of
good
people
both
of
them
and
we
have
a
girl
now
that
frightens
me
so
the
door
opened
and
three
misses
came
in
to
take
their
seats
three
types
as
it
happened
of
certain
classes
into
which
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to

the
girls
kept
coming
in
one
after
another
or
in
pairs
or
groups
until
the
was
nearly
full
then
there
was
a
little
pause
and
a
light
step
was
heard
in
the
passage
the
eyes
turned
to
the
door
and
the
master
followed
them
in
the
same
direction
a
girl
of
about
seventeen
entered
she
was
tall
and
slender
but
rounded
with
a
peculiar
undulation
of
movement
such
as
one
sometimes
sees
in
perfectly
untutored
whom
nature
the
queen
of
graces
has
taken
in
hand
but
more
commonly
in
connection
with
the
very
highest
breeding
of
the
most
thoroughly
trained
society
she
was
a
splendid
scowling
beauty
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
that
was
always
like
a
surprise
when
her
lips
parted
she
wore
a
checkered
dress
of
a
curious
pattern
and
a
scarf
twisted
a
little
fantastically
about
her
she
went
to
her
seat
which
she
had
moved
a
short
distance
apart
from
the
rest
and
sitting
down
began
playing
listlessly
with
her
gold
chain
as
was
a
common
habit
with
her
coiling
it
and
uncoiling
it
about
her
slender
wrist
and
braiding
it
in
with
her
long
delicate
fingers
presently
she
looked
up
black
piercing
eyes
not
large
a
low
forehead
as
low
as
that
of
clytie
in
the
townley
bust
black
hair
twisted
in
heavy
braids
a
face
that
one
could
not
help
looking
at
for
its
beauty
yet
that
one
wanted
to
look
away
from
for
something
in
its
expression
and
could
not
for
those
diamond
eyes
they
were
fixed
on
the
now
the
latter
turned
her
own
away
and
let
them
wander
over
the
other
scholars
but
they
could
not
help
coming
back
again
for
a
single
glance
at
the
wild
beauty
the
diamond
eyes
were
on
her
still
she
turned
the
leaves
of
several
of
her
books
as
if
in
search
of
some
passage
and
when
she
thought
she
had
waited
long
enough
to
be
safe
once
more
stole
a
quick
look
at
the
dark
girl
the
diamond
eyes
were
still
upon
her
she
put
her
kerchief
to
her
forehead
which
had
grown
slightly
moist
she
sighed
once
almost
shivered
for
she
felt
cold
then
following
some
impulse
which
she
could
not
resist
she
left
her
place
and
went
to
the
young
girl
desk
what
do
you
want
of
me
elsie
venner
it
was
a
strange
question
to
put
for
the
girl
had
not
signified
that
she
wished
the
teacher
to
come
to
her
nothing
she
said
i
thought
i
could
make
you
come
the
girl
spoke
in
a
low
tone
a
kind
of
she
did
not
lisp
yet
her
articulation
of
one
or
two
consonants
was
not
absolutely
perfect
where
did
you
get
that
flower
elsie
said
miss
darley
it
was
a
rare
alpine
flower
which
was
found
only
in
one
spot
among
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
where
it
grew
said
elsie
venner
take
it
the
teacher
could
not
refuse
her
the
girl
touched
hers
as
she
took
it
how
cold
they
were
for
a
girl
of
such
an
organization
the
teacher
went
back
to
her
seat
she
made
an
excuse
for
quitting
the
soon
afterwards
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
fling
the
flower
into
her
fireplace
and
rake
the
ashes
over
it
the
second
was
to
wash
the
tips
of
her
fingers
as
if
she
had
been
another
lady
macbeth
a
poor
overtasked
nervous
creature
we
must
not
think
too
much
of
her
fancies
after
school
was
done
she
finished
the
talk
with
the
master
which
had
been
so
suddenly
interrupted
there
were
things
spoken
of
which
may
prove
interesting
but
there
are
other
matters
we
must
first
attend
to
is
the
religious
want
of
the
age
met
to
answer
this
question
intelligently
we
must
first
glance
at
the
characteristics
of
the
age
it
is
an
age
of
remarkable
activity
there
have
been
industrious
men
in
other
days
there
have
been
nations
of
whom
it
might
be
truly
said
they
were
an
industrious
people
they
lost
no
time
in
idleness
but
their
rate
of
speed
was
low
such
a
people
could
hardly
be
deemed
enterprising
they
might
continue
uncomplainingly
in
their
accustomed
round
of
labors
but
would
lack
impulse
to
attempt
anything
new
circumstances
did
not
compel
them
to
unwonted
efforts
and
their
capabilities
lay
dormant
the
world
was
wide
the
population
comparatively
sparse
and
the
means
of
subsistence
not
difficult
of
attainment
our
age
is
very
unlike
to
that
people
begin
to
crowd
one
another
there
is
competition
the
more
active
and
ingenious
will
have
the
advantage
they
do
have
the
advantage
and
this
fact
is
a
constant
stimulus
it
has
been
operating
for
thirty
years
past
with
power
we
seem
to
be
approaching
a
climax
a
point
beyond
which
flesh
and
blood
can
not
go
the
enterprise
of
the
more
active
spirits
of
our
day
is
astounding
we
begin
to
ask
will
they
stop
at
anything
what
will
they
not
undertake
there
are
a
great
many
unsuccessful
attempts
but
these
are
not
necessarily
observed
they
pass
quietly
into
obscurity
while
we
hasten
to
observe
the
successes
which
are
wonderful
and
so
numerous
as
to
keep
us
ever
on
tiptoe
looking
for
new
wonders
having
seen
the
railways
the
magnetic
telegraph
and
hoe
press
in
full
operation
and
having
been
brought
to
accept
these
as
a
common
measure
of
time
and
motion
we
find
ourselves
indisposed
for
older
usages
we
find
our
age
an
age
of
daring
and
of
doing
we
are
ready
to
discard
the
word
from
our
vocabulary
we
deny
that
anything
is
the
less
probable
because
of
being
unprecedented
for
doing
new
things
we
look
about
for
new
means
being
full
charged
with
the
belief
that
for
all
worthy
or
desirable
ends
there
must
be
adequate
and
available
means
in
this
regard
it
is
an
age
of
unprecedented
faith
of
expectation
of
success
and
we
all
know
the
natural
and
necessary
influence
of
such
an
expectation
sanguine
expectation
lights
up
the
fires
of
genius
invention
is
quickened
for
the
attainment
of
the
highest
speed
and
the
greatest
momentum
in
no
former
age
has
there
been
anything
to
compare
in
rapidity
and
power
of
movement
with
the
achievements
of
this
age
the
relation
of
books
to
men
and
the
sphere
assigned
to
books
are
materially
modified
by
the
characteristics
of
the
age
books
as
books
are
no
longer
a
charm
to
conjure
with
the
few
really
superior
books
have
a
wider
and
greater
influence
than
ever
before
while
the
great
mass
of
common
books
have
less
and
pass
more
easily
into
oblivion
good
books
may
and
must
help
us
but
books
can
not
make
us
men
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
a
power
in
it
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
world
within
us
as
it
stands
related
to
the
world
without
us
is
something
quite
different
from
mere
this
is
an
element
of
influence
not
only
not
confined
to
the
bookmen
but
often
possessed
in
a
transcendent
degree
by
those
whose
devotion
to
books
is
altogether
subordinate
to
other
avocations
our
education
may
be
said
to
bring
the
entire
people
upon
a
common
plane
we
are
no
longer
the
esoteric
and
the
exoteric
we
understand
our
rights
in
the
common
fund
of
sense
and
truth
very
well
we
are
not
very
patient
with
those
who
affect
to
know
better
than
ourselves
what
we
want
and
what
we
ought
to
desire
most
men
are
exceedingly
in
earnest
and
determined
to
be
heard
in
their
own
cause
and
well
able
to
make
themselves
understood
scribes
and
pharisees
compassing
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte
are
a
good
and
bad
type
of
our
activity
in
the
pursuit
of
our
own
ends
innumerable
and
infinitely
varied
are
the
shifts
employed
to
secure
attention
to
effect
the
sale
of
merchandise
and
to
increase
income
nor
are
the
learned
professions
much
behind
the
men
of
merchandise
the
contest
of
life
thickens
competition
for
the
fruits
of
labor
waxes
continually
more
fierce
mother
earth
is
too
moderate
in
her
labors
the
ranks
of
the
producers
suffer
from
desertion
the
plough
is
forsaken
the
patient
ox
is
contemned
silence
seclusion
and
meditation
are
a
memory
of
the
past
the
world
axis
is
changed
there
is
more
heat
in
the
north
the
world
has
advanced
in
our
age
from
a
speed
of
five
miles
an
hour
to
twenty
or
thirty
or
more
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
accruing
from
these
movements
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
fact
that
they
have
greatly
affected
the
position
and
the
relations
of
speakers
and
hearers
the
million
have
been
driven
to
do
so
much
for
themselves
that
they
are
in
no
little
danger
of
jumping
to
the
conclusion
that
they
no
longer
need
teachers
of
religion
a
conclusion
so
fraught
with
mischief
to
the
race
will
not
be
arrested
by
a
pertinacious
adhesion
to
modes
of
preaching
which
men
under
the
training
could
be
made
to
endure
but
which
contrasts
have
rendered
intolerable
it
is
just
here
if
anywhere
that
a
special
backwardness
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
to
meet
the
religious
wants
of
the
age
may
without
injustice
or
unkindness
be
alleged
it
comes
about
very
naturally
the
training
of
the
clergy
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
exigencies
of
the
position
they
are
intended
to
occupy
the
endeavors
of
the
preparatory
schools
are
not
to
be
depreciated
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
say
too
much
of
the
fundamental
importance
of
thoroughness
and
of
minute
accuracy
in
the
rudiments
of
learning
but
that
extreme
zeal
in
this
behalf
has
produced
an
unnatural
divorce
of
the
practical
from
the
critical
it
is
vain
to
deny
the
devotion
to
the
latter
which
is
inaugurated
in
the
preparatory
school
is
by
the
college
inflamed
to
the
utmost
and
the
young
man
reaches
his
climax
when
he
receives
the
appointment
of
valedictorian
that
is
his
end
he
reaches
it
and
we
may
say
it
is
the
death
of
him
he
may
indeed
enter
the
theological
seminary
industriously
resolved
on
more
of
the
same
supremacy
but
in
most
instances
the
great
practical
ends
of
a
life
of
doing
good
have
been
already
lost
from
his
view
and
the
ways
and
means
by
which
alone
such
ends
can
be
reached
have
become
offensive
to
him
the
student
as
he
delights
in
calling
himself
has
become
greatly
more
interested
in
knowledge
than
in
the
people
for
whom
he
is
to
use
his
knowledge
a
certain
unknown
god
an
idol
in
short
quite
unsuspected
whose
name
is
is
installed
in
his
heart
in
the
place
of
the
son
of
god
and
the
man
endures
the
trials
of
his
ministerial
life
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
he
is
a
martyr
for
christ
he
compels
himself
to
be
satisfied
with
a
measure
of
attention
to
his
utterances
which
would
content
no
sane
and
sensible
man
in
any
other
department
of
teaching
he
will
tell
you
that
it
is
one
of
the
inevitable
infelicities
of
his
vocation
that
to
nothing
are
men
such
unwilling
listeners
as
to
religious
truth
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
untrue
for
to
nothing
are
men
so
prepared
to
listen
as
to
religious
truth
properly
presented
in
order
to
a
more
generally
happy
and
successful
prosecution
of
the
duties
of
a
minister
of
christ
a
preliminary
fact
requires
to
be
considered
that
a
man
is
found
or
finds
himself
in
any
calling
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
he
is
fitted
for
that
calling
this
is
just
as
true
of
the
ministry
as
of
any
other
vocation
every
knows
this
the
clergy
seem
to
us
behind
the
age
in
being
astonishingly
blind
to
it
know
that
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
their
number
can
ever
attain
eminent
success
they
know
that
in
a
term
of
twenty
years
men
in
a
hundred
here
and
there
one
develops
a
remarkable
talent
for
the
specific
business
in
which
he
is
engaged
the
discover
that
they
have
a
weary
contest
to
maintain
with
manifold
contingencies
and
combinations
which
no
foresight
can
preclude
the
application
of
this
general
truth
to
their
profession
the
clergy
are
backward
to
perceive
the
consequences
of
this
backwardness
are
very
hurtful
to
their
interests
because
of
this
we
have
an
indefinite
amount
of
puerile
and
undignified
complaint
from
disappointed
men
of
disingenuous
misrepresentation
from
incompetent
men
who
have
entered
upon
labors
they
were
never
fitted
to
accomplish
such
men
undertake
their
labors
in
ways
that
want
and
must
want
the
divine
sanction
and
they
are
tempted
to
ward
off
a
just
verdict
of
unsuitableness
and
of
incompetency
by
bringing
many
and
grievous
charges
against
their
flocks
a
mania
for
a
hankering
for
architectural
splendor
or
for
discursive
and
satirical
preaching
or
for
something
florid
or
profound
these
and
the
like
imputations
have
been
put
forward
as
a
screen
by
many
an
unsuccessful
preacher
who
failed
simply
failed
not
in
selling
horns
or
hides
shirtings
or
sugars
but
failed
to
recommend
christ
and
his
gospel
failed
for
want
of
head
or
heart
or
industry
or
all
three
the
man
who
embarks
his
all
in
hardware
drugs
or
law
runs
the
risk
of
failure
if
his
neighbor
can
rise
earlier
walk
faster
talk
faster
work
harder
and
hold
on
longer
he
will
get
the
avails
that
might
suffice
for
both
this
unalterable
fact
every
accepts
do
you
inquire
to
what
good
purpose
do
you
thrust
the
possibility
of
failure
upon
the
attention
of
the
candidate
for
the
ministry
would
you
utterly
discourage
those
who
are
already
more
alive
to
the
perils
of
their
undertaking
than
we
could
wish
them
we
answer
it
is
no
kindness
to
encourage
men
to
enter
a
ministry
whose
inexorable
requirements
and
whose
incidental
possibilities
they
may
not
look
in
the
face
it
is
no
kindness
to
represent
to
them
that
the
qualities
which
they
possess
to
engage
attention
and
that
their
talents
will
command
respect
or
else
it
will
be
the
fault
of
the
people
men
go
into
business
in
the
face
of
a
possibility
of
failure
through
uncontrollable
circumstances
not
in
defiance
of
an
ascertainable
insufferable
incompetency
they
toil
on
accepting
adversity
with
such
equanimity
as
god
gives
them
so
long
as
they
are
permitted
to
believe
that
their
misfortunes
are
not
chargeable
upon
their
incapacity
or
but
when
it
is
made
apparent
that
they
are
not
in
their
proper
sphere
they
think
it
no
shame
to
say
so
to
withdraw
and
to
apply
their
energies
to
something
suited
to
their
tastes
and
capabilities
and
it
should
be
with
the
ministry
but
as
things
now
are
with
the
conceptions
of
the
ministry
now
entertained
pride
interposes
to
forbid
the
rectification
of
the
most
serious
mistakes
it
is
a
question
of
dignity
and
of
scholarship
whereas
it
should
be
a
question
of
love
to
god
and
man
and
of
real
ability
and
conscious
power
to
bring
them
together
to
reconcile
man
to
god
our
age
is
an
age
of
great
devotion
to
secular
affairs
of
men
who
are
great
in
the
conduct
of
such
affairs
in
every
department
in
life
to
counterbalance
this
our
ministry
must
be
filled
with
an
equally
earnest
devotion
to
god
and
salvation
in
real
ability
our
ministers
ought
to
be
not
a
whit
behind
but
ability
is
not
necessarily
scholarship
though
it
may
and
as
far
as
possible
should
include
that
and
a
great
deal
more
let
it
be
fully
understood
once
for
all
that
we
have
no
disparaging
remark
to
make
of
scholarship
a
man
must
be
foolish
beyond
expression
who
pretends
to
argue
that
the
highest
scholarship
is
less
than
a
most
important
and
almost
indispensable
auxiliary
to
the
minister
of
christ
all
our
concern
in
the
matter
just
here
is
that
it
shall
be
fully
understood
that
piety
and
real
ability
make
the
minister
of
christ
and
not
scholarship
in
the
words
of
augustine
the
heart
makes
the
minister
but
we
may
safely
assume
that
he
meant
the
heart
of
a
really
able
man
otherwise
we
can
accord
but
a
qualified
respect
to
this
remark
the
prevailing
impression
among
the
ministry
appears
to
be
that
the
man
who
can
not
write
an
able
doctrinal
discourse
is
but
an
inferior
man
fit
only
to
preach
in
an
inferior
place
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
gain
to
the
church
if
scholarship
were
only
so
general
that
the
standard
of
the
universities
could
be
applied
and
only
men
allowed
to
enter
the
ministry
no
doubt
those
who
incline
to
this
view
are
quite
honest
and
not
unkindly
in
it
but
those
who
think
this
grievously
misunderstand
the
necessities
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
reading
men
know
where
to
find
better
reading
than
can
possibly
be
furnished
by
any
man
who
is
bound
to
write
two
sermons
weekly
or
even
one
sermon
a
week
and
to
train
any
corps
of
young
men
in
the
expectation
that
any
considerable
fraction
of
them
will
be
able
to
win
and
to
maintain
a
commanding
influence
in
their
parishes
mainly
by
the
weekly
production
of
learned
discourses
is
to
do
them
the
greatest
injury
by
cherishing
expectations
which
never
can
be
realized
why
do
our
educated
men
of
other
professions
so
seldom
and
so
reluctantly
contribute
to
the
addresses
in
our
religious
assemblies
precisely
because
they
understand
the
difficulty
of
meeting
the
popular
expectation
which
is
created
by
the
prevailing
theory
a
theory
which
demands
that
sermons
and
not
only
that
sermons
but
also
that
all
religious
addresses
should
be
chiefly
characterized
as
learned
acute
scholastic
even
an
irish
preacher
is
reported
in
an
edinburgh
paper
as
saying
lately
that
he
had
been
led
to
think
of
his
own
preaching
and
of
that
of
his
brethren
he
saw
very
few
sermons
in
the
new
testament
shaped
after
the
forms
and
fashion
in
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
shape
theirs
he
was
not
aware
of
a
sermon
there
in
which
they
had
a
little
motto
selected
upon
which
a
disquisition
upon
a
particular
subject
was
hung
the
sort
of
sermons
which
the
people
in
his
locality
were
desirous
to
hear
were
sermons
delivered
on
a
large
portion
of
the
word
of
god
carrying
through
the
ideas
as
the
spirit
of
god
had
done
and
it
is
in
part
at
least
because
of
the
prevailing
disregard
of
this
most
reasonable
desire
that
parishes
so
soon
weary
of
their
ministers
it
need
not
discourage
ministers
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
will
be
failures
in
the
ministry
and
a
great
many
failures
among
those
who
rely
for
their
success
mainly
upon
the
weekly
production
of
learned
disquisitions
discouragement
is
not
in
accepting
a
fact
that
accords
with
all
just
theories
of
truth
but
in
adopting
a
theory
which
is
sure
to
be
invalidated
by
the
almost
universal
experience
of
men
in
as
well
as
out
of
the
ministry
a
minister
have
many
falls
in
struggling
up
his
hill
of
difficulty
but
the
lord
will
lift
him
up
and
will
save
him
from
adding
to
the
temperate
grief
proper
to
any
measure
of
the
intolerable
poignancy
that
comes
of
cheating
by
false
pretences
of
assuming
to
do
what
he
knows
or
should
know
that
he
can
not
do
namely
produce
any
considerable
number
of
great
sermons
let
it
then
be
frankly
owned
that
men
very
good
men
very
capable
men
have
failed
in
the
ministry
failed
because
he
did
not
study
because
he
did
not
visit
his
people
because
he
could
not
talk
because
he
was
too
grave
because
he
was
too
frivolous
could
not
or
would
not
control
his
temper
alienated
by
exacting
more
than
he
received
and
all
of
them
because
of
not
having
what
scougal
calls
the
life
of
god
in
the
soul
of
man
it
is
not
worth
while
for
any
man
to
go
into
the
ministry
who
can
not
relish
the
apostle
invitation
running
thus
i
beseech
you
therefore
brethren
by
the
mercies
of
god
that
ye
present
your
bodies
living
holy
acceptable
unto
god
which
is
your
reasonable
service
if
that
seem
not
reasonable
ay
and
exceedingly
inviting
too
better
let
it
alone
all
men
can
not
do
all
things
better
raise
extraordinary
potatoes
than
hammer
out
insignificant
ideas
you
do
not
see
the
connection
you
were
a
man
in
college
and
know
that
you
can
write
better
than
many
a
man
in
a
metropolitan
pulpit
very
likely
but
we
of
the
few
go
to
church
to
be
made
better
men
and
not
by
fine
writing
but
by
significant
ideas
which
may
come
in
a
homely
garb
so
they
be
only
pervaded
with
affectionate
piety
but
which
can
come
to
us
only
from
one
who
has
laid
all
ambitious
on
the
altar
of
god
there
is
a
power
of
persuasion
in
every
minister
who
follows
god
as
a
dear
child
and
who
walks
in
love
as
christ
loved
us
which
the
hardest
heart
can
not
long
resist
which
will
win
the
congregation
however
an
individual
here
and
there
may
be
able
to
harden
himself
against
it
you
think
that
the
great
power
of
the
pulpit
is
in
high
doctrine
presented
with
metaphysical
precision
and
acuteness
we
have
no
disparagement
to
offer
of
your
doctrinal
knowledge
nor
of
your
ability
to
state
it
with
metaphysical
precision
and
acuteness
but
we
know
from
much
experience
that
there
is
a
divine
truth
and
a
fervor
and
power
in
imparting
it
with
which
god
inspires
the
man
who
is
wholly
devoted
to
him
in
comparison
with
which
the
higher
achievements
of
the
man
who
lacks
these
are
trumpery
and
rubbish
many
men
have
failed
in
the
ministry
are
failing
in
the
ministry
every
day
because
their
principal
reliance
has
been
upon
what
they
deem
their
thorough
mastery
of
the
soundest
theories
of
doctrine
and
of
duty
they
were
confident
they
could
administer
to
minds
and
hearts
diseased
the
certain
specific
laid
down
in
the
book
admeasured
to
the
twentieth
part
of
a
scruple
confident
in
their
theoretical
acquisitions
they
could
not
comprehend
the
indispensable
necessity
of
a
large
experience
in
actual
cases
of
mental
malady
and
for
the
want
of
such
experience
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
they
should
be
with
the
souls
they
honestly
desired
to
benefit
can
you
heal
a
with
a
syllogism
there
is
no
dispensing
with
the
precept
and
prescription
weep
with
those
that
weep
be
of
the
same
mind
one
toward
another
theories
of
doctrine
and
of
practice
are
not
without
their
value
but
the
minister
who
is
merely
or
chiefly
a
theorist
whether
in
doctrines
or
in
measures
is
an
adventurer
and
the
chances
against
him
are
as
many
as
the
chances
against
the
precise
similarity
of
any
two
cases
presented
to
his
attention
as
many
as
the
chances
against
the
education
of
any
two
men
of
fifty
years
being
precisely
alike
in
every
particular
and
in
all
their
results
the
soul
problems
are
not
to
be
solved
by
theories
such
was
not
the
practice
of
the
great
physician
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
theories
shirk
that
all
their
affliction
he
was
afflicted
in
his
love
and
in
his
pity
he
redeemed
and
precisely
in
this
way
his
ministers
are
now
to
follow
up
his
practice
our
age
is
growing
less
and
less
tolerant
of
formality
less
and
less
willing
to
accept
metaphysical
disquisition
in
place
of
a
loving
fervent
expansion
of
the
word
of
god
recommended
to
the
understanding
and
to
the
sensibility
by
lively
illustrations
of
spiritual
truth
derived
from
all
the
experience
of
life
from
all
observation
from
all
analogies
in
the
natural
world
in
short
from
every
manner
of
illumination
from
the
heavens
above
from
the
earth
beneath
and
from
the
waters
which
are
under
the
earth
god
is
surely
everywhere
and
hath
made
all
things
and
all
to
testify
of
him
and
the
innumerable
voices
all
agree
together
and
when
this
is
both
understood
and
felt
what
rules
shall
be
given
to
guide
and
control
the
construction
and
the
delivery
of
discourses
shall
we
say
the
people
must
be
brought
back
to
the
endurance
ay
that
is
the
word
of
laborious
ratiocinations
wherein
the
truth
is
diligently
pursued
for
its
own
sake
with
an
ultimate
reference
indeed
to
the
needs
and
uses
of
the
hearer
but
so
remote
as
rarely
to
be
noticed
except
by
that
very
small
fraction
of
any
customary
congregation
who
may
chance
to
have
an
interest
in
such
doings
some
of
whom
watch
the
clergyman
as
they
would
the
entomologist
running
down
a
truth
that
he
may
impale
it
and
add
one
more
specimen
to
his
collection
of
common
and
of
uncommon
bugs
our
neighbors
in
the
south
do
better
than
this
for
they
hunt
with
the
lasso
and
never
throw
the
noose
except
to
capture
something
which
can
be
harnessed
to
the
wheels
of
common
life
no
the
people
are
not
going
back
to
the
endurance
of
any
such
misery
they
have
found
out
that
rhetoric
is
by
no
means
the
one
thing
needful
and
care
far
less
for
the
of
speech
than
for
the
of
a
holy
heart
they
want
a
man
to
speak
less
of
what
he
believes
and
more
of
what
he
feels
the
expectation
of
bringing
the
people
again
to
endure
prolonged
metaphysical
discriminations
spun
out
of
commonplace
minds
cobwebs
to
cloak
their
own
nakedness
and
universal
inaptitude
if
indulged
is
absurdly
indulged
the
whole
church
is
sick
of
such
trifling
she
knows
well
that
it
has
made
her
most
unsavory
to
those
who
might
have
found
their
way
into
the
temples
of
god
or
kept
their
places
there
but
for
the
memory
of
an
immense
amount
of
wearisome
readings
from
the
pulpit
too
often
a
vocabulary
of
words
seldom
or
never
found
out
of
sermons
a
manner
of
speech
which
when
tried
by
the
sure
test
of
natural
animated
conversation
must
be
pronounced
absurd
and
abominable
it
is
a
wonder
of
wonders
that
in
spite
of
such
drawbacks
an
individual
here
and
there
has
been
reclaimed
from
worldliness
to
the
love
and
service
of
god
the
of
the
clergy
most
naturally
lead
them
to
prefer
the
formal
statement
the
studied
elaboration
of
ideas
which
their
own
training
can
not
but
render
facile
and
dear
to
them
and
there
is
here
and
there
a
man
who
in
virtue
of
extraordinary
genius
can
infuse
new
life
into
phrases
a
man
or
two
who
can
for
a
moment
or
for
an
hour
by
the
very
weight
and
excellence
of
their
thoughts
and
because
they
truly
and
deeply
feel
them
arrest
the
age
and
challenge
and
secure
attention
in
spite
of
all
the
infelicities
of
an
antiquated
style
and
an
unearthly
delivery
but
in
this
age
more
than
ever
before
we
are
summoned
to
surrender
our
scholastic
preferences
and
esoteric
honors
to
the
exigencies
of
the
million
and
the
men
of
this
generation
have
without
much
conference
come
with
great
unanimity
to
the
determination
that
they
will
not
long
endure
either
in
or
out
of
the
pulpit
speakers
who
are
dull
and
unaffecting
whether
from
want
of
words
ideas
or
method
and
wisdom
in
the
arrangement
of
them
or
lack
of
sympathies
and
especially
that
they
will
not
endure
dull
declamation
from
the
pulpit
if
any
man
really
wish
to
know
how
he
is
preaching
let
him
imagine
himself
conversing
earnestly
with
an
intelligent
and
highly
gifted
but
uneducated
man
or
woman
in
his
own
parlor
or
with
his
younger
children
would
any
but
an
idiot
keep
on
talking
when
with
half
an
eye
he
might
discern
tedious
wrought
by
himself
upon
the
uncalloused
sensibilities
of
his
hearers
how
long
ought
a
sermon
to
be
as
long
as
you
can
read
in
the
eye
of
of
your
audience
go
if
you
can
not
read
that
you
have
mistaken
your
vocation
you
were
never
called
to
the
ministry
the
secret
of
the
persuasive
power
of
our
favorite
orators
is
in
their
constant
recognition
of
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sensibilities
they
are
acting
upon
their
speech
is
in
effect
an
actual
conversation
in
which
they
are
speaking
for
as
well
as
to
the
audience
and
the
interlocutors
are
made
almost
as
palpably
such
as
at
the
table
of
our
dramatic
autocrat
in
contrast
with
this
the
dull
preacher
falling
below
the
dignity
and
the
privilege
of
his
office
addresses
himself
not
to
living
men
but
to
an
imaginary
sensibility
to
abstract
truth
the
effect
of
this
is
obvious
and
inevitable
it
converts
hearers
into
doubters
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
be
any
such
thing
as
a
religion
worth
recommending
or
possessing
and
preachers
into
complainers
of
the
people
as
indifferent
and
insensible
to
the
truth
a
libel
which
ought
to
render
them
liable
to
fine
and
punishment
truth
is
never
a
matter
of
indifference
or
of
insensibility
to
an
intelligent
nor
even
to
an
unintelligent
audience
however
an
individual
here
and
there
may
contrive
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
sphere
of
its
influence
truth
can
no
more
lose
her
power
than
the
sun
can
lose
his
heat
the
people
under
the
quickening
influences
characteristic
of
our
age
are
awaking
to
the
consciousness
that
on
the
day
which
should
be
the
best
of
all
the
week
they
have
been
defrauded
of
their
right
in
having
solemn
dulness
palmed
upon
them
in
place
of
living
earnest
animated
truth
let
not
ministers
unwisely
overlooking
this
undeniable
fact
defame
the
people
by
alleging
a
growing
facility
in
dissolving
the
pastoral
relation
a
disregard
of
solemn
contracts
a
willingness
to
dismiss
excellent
godly
and
devoted
men
without
other
reason
than
the
indisposition
to
retain
them
be
it
known
to
all
such
that
capable
men
very
department
of
life
were
never
in
such
request
as
at
this
very
hour
and
never
since
the
world
began
was
there
an
audience
so
large
and
so
attentive

more
than
personal
reminiscences
of
a
period
ending
some
or
thirty
years
before
they
wrote
the
one
is
always
careless
the
other
died
too
suddenly
to
give
his
hastily
written
anecdotes
revision
both
must
be
corrected
as
they
may
easily
be
but
have
not
yet
been
by
contemporaneous
authorities
their
errors
are
constantly
repeated
in
the
biographical
articles
upon
beethoven
which
we
find
in
the
encyclopaedias
with
one
exception
the
article
in
the
new
american
published
by
the
appletons
a
life
of
beethoven
founded
upon
a
careful
digest
of
these
writers
combined
with
the
materials
scattered
through
other
publications
even
though
no
original
researches
were
made
was
still
a
desideratum
when
the
very
remarkable
work
upon
mozart
by
the
russian
alexander
oulibichef
appeared
and
aroused
a
singular
excitement
in
the
german
musical
circles
through
the
real
or
supposed
injustice
towards
beethoven
into
which
the
of
the
author
had
led
him
we
had
hopes
that
now
some
one
of
the
great
master
countrymen
would
give
us
something
worthy
of
him
but
the
excitement
expended
itself
in
pamphlets
and
articles
in
periodicals
in
which
as
little
was
done
for
history
as
was
effected
against
the
views
of
oulibichef
another
russian
however
wilhelm
von
lenz
came
to
the
rescue
in
two
works
beethoven
et
ses
trois
styles
vols
petersburg
and
beethoven
eine
kunststudie
vols
cassel
a
very
feeble
champion
this
herr
von
lenz
the
first
of
his
two
works
in
french
rather
of
the
order
consists
principally
of
an
analyse
des
sonates
de
piano
of
beethoven
in
which
these
works
are
indeed
much
talked
about
but
not
analyzed
the
author
an
amateur
has
plenty
of
zeal
but
unluckily
neither
the
musical
knowledge
nor
the
critical
skill
for
his
task
we
mention
this
took
only
because
the
second
volume
closes
with
a
catalogue
critique
chronologique
et
anecdotique
in
which
the
author
has
with
great
industry
and
care
and
for
the
first
time
brought
together
the
principal
historical
notices
of
beethoven
works
scattered
through
the
pages
of
the
books
above
noticed
and
the
fifty
quarto
volumes
of
the
leipziger
allgemeine
musikalische
zeitung
the
first
volume
of
beethoven
eine
kunststudie
is
a
leben
des
meisters
a
mere
sketch
made
up
from
the
same
works
as
the
catalogue
with
a
very
few
additions
from
other
sources
as
a
biographer
lenz
fails
as
signally
as
in
his
capacity
of
critic
much
original
matter
from
one
living
so
far
away
was
not
to
be
expected
but
he
has
made
no
commendable
use
of
the
printed
authorities
which
he
had
at
hand
his
style
is
bombastic
and
feeble
there
is
neither
a
logical
nor
a
chronological
progress
to
his
narrative
moreover
he
is
not
always
trustworthy
even
in
matters
personal
to
himself
at
all
events
a
very
interesting
account
of
a
meeting
between
him
and
mendelssohn
at
the
house
of
moscheles
in
london
apropos
of
nothing
has
called
out
a
letter
from
the
latter
in
a
leipzig
musical
journal
in
which
the
whole
story
is
declared
to
be
without
foundation
in
our
references
to
lenz
we
shall
consider
his
catalogue
and
his
leben
des
meisters
as
complements
to
each
other
and
forming
a
single
work
lenz
beethoven
et
ses
trois
styles
was
avowedly
directed
against
oulibichef
and
called
out
a
reply
from
that
gentleman
with
the
title
beethoven
ses
critiques
et
ses
glossateurs
paris
and
leipzig
in
which
poor
lenz
is
annihilated
but
which
makes
no
pretensions
to
biographical
value
it
contains
indeed
a
sketch
of
the
life
it
is
but
a
sketch
so
highly
colored
such
a
mere
painting
of
beethoven
as
lie
existed
in
the
author
fancy
not
in
real
life
as
to
convey
a
most
false
idea
of
him
and
of
his
fortunes
the
introduction
is
an
admirable
sketch
of
the
progress
of
music
during
the
first
years
of
the
present
century
a
supplement
to
his
famous
view
of
modern
music
in
his
work
upon
mozart
his
analyses
of
such
of
beethoven
works
as
met
his
approbation
are
masterly
and
unrivalled
save
by
certain
articles
from
the
pens
of
hoffmann
and
our
own
writer
dwight
with
the
later
works
of
the
composer
oulibichef
had
no
sympathy
haydn
and
mozart
had
given
him
his
standards
of
perfection
can
forgive
beethoven
when
at
times
he
rises
above
all
forms
and
rules
in
seeking
new
means
of
expression
oulibichef
could
not
but
it
is
not
endless
discussions
of
beethoven
works
which
the
public
at
all
events
our
public
demands
we
wish
his
biography
the
history
of
his
life
what
has
been
given
us
does
but
whet
the
appetite
we
wish
to
have
the
many
original
sources
still
sealed
to
us
explored
and
the
results
of
this
labor
honestly
given
us
none
of
the
writers
have
been
in
a
position
to
do
this
and
their
publications
are
but
materials
for
the
use
of
the
true
biographer
when
he
shall
appear
it
was
therefore
with
a
pleasure
as
great
as
it
was
unexpected
that
we
saw
some
months
since
the
announcement
of
the
volumes
named
at
the
head
of
this
article
they
now
lie
before
us
we
have
given
thorn
a
very
careful
examination
and
shall
now
endeavor
to
do
them
full
justice
granting
them
much
more
space
than
has
yet
been
accorded
to
them
in
any
german
publication
which
has
come
under
our
notice
because
out
of
germany
the
reputation
of
the
author
is
far
greater
than
at
home
whether
upon
the
old
principle
that
the
prophet
is
not
without
honor
we
hope
hereafter
to
make
clear
some
particulars
respecting
marx
may
find
place
here
as
proving
that
from
no
man
perhaps
have
we
the
right
to
expect
so
much
in
a
biography
of
beethoven
as
from
him
we
draw
them
mostly
from
schilling
encyclopädie
der
gesammten

a
work
which
deserves
to
be
better

in

adolph
bernhard
marx
was
born
at
halle
and
like
so
many
of
the
distinguished
musicians
of
recent
times
is
of
jewish
descent
he
studied
at
the
university
of
his
native
city
choosing
the
law
for
his
profession
but
making
music
the
occupation
of
his
leisure
hours
the
contrapuntist
türk
being
his
instructor
in
musical
theory
and
composition
he
türk
soon
saw
whom
he
had
before
him
and
told
marx
at
once
that
he
was
born
to
be
a
musician
soon
after
finishing
his
legal
studies
marx
removed
to
berlin
as
the
place
where
he
could
best
enjoy
the
means
of
artistic
culture
for
one
quite
without
fortune
merely
to
live
in
a
strange
city
demands
great
strength
of
character
but
to
go
farther
and
fit
one
self
for
a
career
and
for
a
position
in
the
future
which
even
under
the
best
auspices
is
of
very
difficult
attainment
and
beside
all
this
to
have
others
dependent
upon
him
for
the
necessaries
of
life
what
a
burden
to
bear
by
a
very
intellectual
system
of
instruction
in
singing
and
in
composition
and
at
a
later
period
by
editing
the
allgemeine
musikzeitung
and
several
theoretical
and
practical
musical
works
he
earned
the
means
of
subsistence
never
was
a
periodical
more
conscientiously
edited
it
was
for
marx
like
an
official
station
and
his
seven
years
upon
that
paper
were
in
fact
a
preparation
for
the
position
of
public
teacher
to
which
in
he
was
appointed
in
the
university
at
berlin
after
having
declined
a
judicial
position
offered
to
him
with
a
fair
salary
in
one
of
the
provinces
honorably
has
he
since
that
period
filled
his
station
however
great
the
pains
which
have
been
taken
in
various
quarters
that
it
should
not
be
said
of
him
post
nummos
the
diploma
of
doctor
of
music
marx
received
from
the
university
at
marburg
and
thereupon
obtained
the
greatest
applause
for
a
course
of
lectures
in
part
strictly
scientific
for
the
musician
and
in
part
upon
the
history
of
music
its
philosophy
etc
also
as
of
the
university
he
has
brought
the
academic
choir
into
such
a
flourishing
state
both
as
to
numbers
and
skill
as
to
be
adequate
to
the
most
difficult
music
again
we
read
we
remember
that
some
time
since
fetis
at
paris
pointed
out
marx
as
the
one
who
had
introduced
the
philosophy
of
kant
into
music
were
this
so
so
much
the
more
credit
to
marx
who
at
that
time
we
are
informed
had
never
studied
the
works
of
the
philosopher
of
königsberg
and
his
basing
music
upon
the
kantian
philosophy
is
therefore
but
a
proof
of
the
profundity
of
his
genius
from
the
same

we
extract

following

we
have
perhaps
quoted
somewhat
too
largely
from
the
article
in
schilling
but
have
thought
so
much
necessary
to
give
the
reader
the
basis
of
the
great
reputation
which
marx
has
particularly
in
england
and
the
united
states
for
singular
as
the
fact
may
appear
we
are
unable
to
recall
the
name
of
any
young
composer
who
has
appeared
and
gained
any
considerable
degree
of
success
since
marx
began
to
teach
whom
he
can
claim
as
his
pupil
most
of
the
younger

are
from
the
schools
of

and

and

professors
marx
reputation
then
is
that
of
an
author
a
writer
upon
music
there
is
one
fact
however
worthy
of
mention
in
regard
to
the
article
from
which
we
have
quoted
which
while
it
exhibits
the
modesty
of
marx
modesty
the
ornament
of
true
greatness
may
or
may
not
add
weight
to
the
extracts
we
have
made
from
it
namely
that
the
article
was
written
for
schilling
by
marx
himself
we
have
then
a
man
of
years
whose
youth
and
early
manhood
fell
in
the
period
of
beethoven
greatest
efforts
and
fame
a
musician
by
profession
and
composer
but
through
the
opposition
of
singers
and
musicians
and
the
scandalous
journalism
of
berlin
forced
from
the
path
of
composition
into
that
of
the
science
and
literature
of
the
art
for
thirty
years
lecturer
on
the
history
and
philosophy
of
music
professor
of
the
art
in
the
first
of
german
universities
a
position
both
social
and
professional
which
gives
him
command
of
all
the
sources
of
information
dweller
in
a
city
which
possesses
one
of
the
finest
musical
libraries
in
the
world
that
too
in
which
the
bulk
of
the
beethoven
papers
are
preserved
a
city
moreover
in
which
more
than
in
any
other
the
more
profound
works
of
the
master
are
studied
and
publicly
performed
certainly
from
no
man
living
have
we
the
right
to
expect
so
much
as
biographer
of
beethoven
as
from
this
man
we
have
no
extravagant
ideas
of
the
value
of
the
of
beethoven
we
are
aware
that
they
seldom
contain
anything
from
the
hand
of
the
master
himself
being
made
up
of
course
of
what
people
had
to
say
to
him
but
one
hundred
and
such
books
though
in
many
cases
but
a
sheet
or
two
of
foolscap
doubled
together
generally
filled
with
mere
scribbling
now
by
his
brother
now
by
the
nephew
then
by
schindler
or
the
old
housekeeper
upon
money
matters
and
domestic
arrangements
but
often
by
artists
poets
and
literary
men
not
only
of
vienna
but
in
some
cases
even
from
england
and
in
one
from
america
must
contain
a
great
mass
of
matter
which
places
one
amidst
those
by
whom
the
master
was
surrounded
makes
one
to
know
his
and
his
and
occasionally
facts
of
high
importance
in
the
study
of
his
character
and
the
circumstances
in
which
he
spent
his
last
years
for
some
twelve
years
these
books
have
been
in
berlin
and
at
the
disposal
of
marx
the
numerous
files
of
musical
periodicals
and
the
mass
of
musical
biography
and
recent
musical
history
preserved
in
the
royal
library
must
be
of
inestimable
value
to
the
writer
on
beethoven
a
value
which
marx
must
fully
appreciate
both
from
his
former
labors
as
editor
and
his
more
recent
onus
as
contributor
of
biographical
articles
to
schilling
encyclopedia
as
we
take
up
this
new
life
of
beethoven
then
the
measure
of
our
expectations
is
the
reputation
of
the
author
plus
the
means
the
materials
at
his
command
and
certainly
the
first
impression
made
by
these
two
goodly
volumes
is
a
very
favorable
one
for
making
due
allowance
for
the
music
scattered
through
them
with
not
too
lavish
a
hand
by
way
of
examples
we
have
still
some
six
hundred
solid
pages
of
reading
matter
space
enough
in
which
to
answer
many
a
vexed
question
clear
up
many
a
dark
point
give
us
the
results
of
widely
extended
researches
and
place
beethoven
the
man
and
the
composer
before
us
in
leben
und
schaffen
in
his
life
and
his
labors
in
the
first
cursory
glance
through
the
work
we
were
struck
by
an
apparent
disproportion
of
space
allotted
to
different
topics
and
have
taken
some
pains
to
examine
to
how
great
an
extent
this
disproportion
really
exists
we
find
that
in
the
first
volume
four
works
the
first
second
and
third
symphonies
and
the
opera
leonore
or
fidelio
occupy
of
the
pages
in
the
second
that
the
other
five
symphonies
and
the
missa
solemnis
fill
out
of
the
pages
bearing
in
mind
that
the
works
of
beethoven
which
have
numbers
not
to
speak
of
the
others
amount
to
and
that
in
some
cases
three
and
even
six
compositions
so
important
as
the
rasoumowsky
quartetts
for
instance
are
included
in
a
single
the
disproportion
really
appears
very
great
we
notice
moreover
that
just
those
works
which
are
most
familiar
to
the
public
which
have
for
thirty
years
or
more
been
subjects
of
discussion
and
which
one
would
naturally
suppose
might
be
dismissed
in
fewest
words
that
these
are
the
works
which
occupy
so
much
space
what
is
there
so
new
to
be
said
of
the
heroic
symphony
that
fifty
pages
should
be
allotted
to
it
while
the
ballet
prometheus
still
strange
to
nearly
every
reader
should
be
dismissed
in
three
we
find
it
also
somewhat
remarkable
that
marx
thinks
it
necessary
to
give
his
own
notions
of
musical
form
to
the
extent
of
nineteen
pages
vol
pp
preparatory
to
his
discussion
of
the
greater
works
of
the
master
and
yet
is
able
to
condense
the
history
of
beethoven
first
years
the
period
in
our
view
the
most
important
in
making
him
what
he
was
in
sixteen
we
have
not
space
to
follow
this
out
farther
and
only
add
that
were
this
work
a
mere
affair
by
an
unknown
writer
we
should
suspect
him
of
drawing
out
the
thread
of
his
verbosity
on
topics
where
materials
are
plenty
and
talk
is
easy
in
preference
to
the
labor
of
original
research
on
points
less
known
in
reading
the
work
carefully
two
points
strike
us
in
relation
to
his
printed
authorities
first
that
the
list
of
those
quoted
by
lenz
in
his
catalogue
and
leben
des
meisters
comprises
nearly
all
those
cited
by
marx
the
principal
additions
being
the
works
of
lenz
oulibichef
and
a
marx
the
latter
of
which
he
exhibits
great
skill
in
finding
and
making
opportunities
to
advertise
and
secondly
that
where
the
russian
writer
through
haste
carelessness
or
the
want
of
means
to
verify
facts
and
correct
errors
falls
into
mistakes
the
berlin
professor
generally
agrees
with
him
as
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
a
gentleman
who
for
nearly
thirty
years
writes
himself
in
any
bill
warrant
quittance
or
obligation
extraordinary
professor
of
a
great
german
university
should
simply
adopt
the
labors
of
an
obscure
russian
writer
without
acknowledgment
we
can
only
suppose
these
resemblances
to
be
coincidences
these
coincidences
are
nevertheless
so
numerous
that
we
may
say
in
general
what
lenz
knew
of
the
history
of
the
man
beethoven
and
his
works
is
known
to
marx
what
was
unknown
to
the
former
is
equally
unknown
to
the
latter
marx
however
occasionally
quotes
passages
from
schindler
wegeler
and
ries
at
length
to
which
lenz
only
gives
references
we
will
note
a
few
of
the
coincidences
between
the
two
writers
here
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
biography
ludwig
van
beethoven
was
born
to
his
father
a
singer
in
the
chapel
of
the
max
archbishop
of
cologne
marx
vol
p
beethoven
was
fourteen
years
old
when
this
elector
came
to
bonn
max
franz
is
confounded
with
max
friedrich
a
singular
mistake
since
wegeler
writes
the
name
in
full
it
may
however
be
a
typographical
error
or
a
on
the
part
of
marx
we
give
him
all
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
unluckily
we
read
on
that
the
archbishop
brother
of
joseph
called
the
protestant
neefe
from
the
theatre
to
the
of
the
electoral
chapel
this
appointment
having
in
fact
been
made
four
years
before
the
brother
of
joseph
ii
had
aught
to
do
with
appointments
in
that
part
of
the
world
lenz
confounds
the
two
electors
in
precisely
the
same
manner
both
lenz
and
marx
relate
the
old
exploded
story
of
the
child
beethoven
and
the
spider
the
former
found
it
in
the
leipziger
allgemeine
musikalische
zeitung
and
probably
had
not
authorities
at
hand
to
correct
it
had
marx
sent
to
the
library
for
arachnologie
the
work
which
he
gives
as
authority
he
would
have
found
that
not
beethoven
but
the
french
violinist
berthaume
was
the
hero
of
the
anecdote
as
indeed
is
also
related
in
encyclopaedia
not
many
pages
after
marx
own
article
on
beethoven
in
that
work
that
lenz
should
misdate
beethoven
visit
to
berlin
is
not
strange
that
marx
a
berliner
should
is
nor
is
it
remarkable
that
lenz
knows
nothing
of
beethoven
years
of
service
as
member
of
the
electoral
orchestra
at
bonn
but
how
marx
should
have
overlooked
it
in
case
he
has
made
researches
into
the
composer
early
history
is
beyond
our
comprehension
schindler
has
mistaken
the
date
of
certain
letters
written
by
beethoven
long
before
he
had
any
personal
intercourse
with
him
the
notes
to
julia
guicciardi
which
he
dates
both
lenz
and
marx
follow
him
in
the
date
both
quote
beethoven
words
that
the
lady
in
question
married
count
gallenberg
before
the
departure
of
the
latter
to
italy
both
coincide
in
overlooking
the
circumstance
related
in
the
leipziger
allgemeine
musikalische
zeitung
that
june
a
grand
performance
of
music
composed
and
directed
by
gallenberg
took
place
at
naples
in
honor
of
joseph
bonaparte
proof
sufficient
that
beethoven
could
not
in
july
of
that
year
have
addressed
the
lady
in
these
terms
mein
engel
mein
alles
mein
ich
both
marx
and
lenz
relate
the
following
anecdote
haydn
meeting
beethoven
praised
the
septett
of
the
latter
upon
which
the
young
man
exclaimed
deprecatingly
ah
it
is
far
from
being
a
to
which
haydn
replied
you
could
not
have
written
for
you
are
an
atheist
that
the
absurdity
of
making
beethoven
then
a
man
of
thirty
and
supposed
to
be
possessed
of
common
sense
hint
at
any
comparison
of
a
piece
of
with
one
of
the
grandest
of
oratorios
and
that
too
to
the
author
himself
should
not
have
struck
marx
is
strange
nor
is
it
less
so
that
in
the
course
of
his
researches
he
has
not
met
with
the
correction
of
the
story
by
the
late
alois
fuchs
of
vienna
in
fact
the
ballet
prometheus
in
which
the
progress
of
man
from
a
state
of
rude
nature
to
the
highest
culture
and
refinement
is
depicted
and
the
creation
were
both
given
for
the
first
time
within
a
few
weeks
of
each
other
the
affinity
of
the
subjects
is
clear
and
the
remark
of
the
young
man
ah
dear
papa
it
is
far
from
being
a
is
only
natural
no
said
haydn
it
is
indeed
not
a
nor
do
i
think
its
author
will
ever
reach
that
in
the
dates
given
by
marx
to
beethoven
compositions
he
generally
coincides
with
lenz
in
his
catalogue
particularly
when
the
latter
is
wrong
and
when
he
differs
from
him
he
is
as
apt
to
be
wrong
as
right
any
person
who
has
both
works
at
command
may
easily
verify
this
remark
but
we
can
not
dwell
longer
on
this
point
of
rufus
choate
the
great
american
by
edward
parker
new
york
mason
brothers
we
think
it
our
duty
to
state
our
judgment
of
this
book
because
it
professes
to
give
personal
reminiscences
by
a
familiar
friend
of
a
remarkable
and
distinguished
man
of
our
own
time
and
country
has
been
much
read
and
discussed
and
has
gained
a
good
deal
of
popularity
of
a
certain
sort
it
therefore
belongs
in
the
literature
of
the
day
perhaps
it
would
have
been
for
the
good
of
some
of
our
readers
if
we
had
done
this
sooner
but
indeed
to
treat
with
entirely
condign
justice
a
book
which
deals
very
freely
and
flippantly
with
the
literary
and
even
the
personal
character
of
one
who
though
an
eminent
and
to
some
extent
a
public
man
was
still
only
yesterday
a
private
gentleman
among
us
a
neighbor
and
a
friend
is
a
matter
of
some
delicacy
by
the
extraordinary
alacrity
with
which
this
book
was
produced
the
author
got
a
little
the
start
of
criticism
perhaps
but
we
should
fail
in
our
duty
as
reviewers
if
he
altogether
escaped
it
in
all
charity
we
are
bound
for
that
matter
to
give
him
the
full
benefit
of
the
speed
he
has
exhibited
in
so
far
as
it
may
serve
to
explain
if
it
can
not
extenuate
the
wretched
manner
in
which
he
has
performed
his
task
for
the
purposes
of
the
bookseller
nothing
could
have
been
happier
than
the
publication
within
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
choate
of
such
a
book
as
this
promised
to
be
throughout
the
country
his
name
had
been
generally
accounted
the
synonyme
of
all
that
was
most
original
mysterious
and
fascinating
in
the
arts
of
the
advocate
and
the
scholar
perhaps
we
have
none
of
us
ever
known
a
man
in
regard
to
whom
a
greater
degree
of
existed
among
his
countrymen
those
who
saw
him
every
day
never
ventured
to
believe
that
they
quite
ever
understood
him
so
various
and
so
peculiar
were
the
aspects
he
exhibited
even
here
at
home
those
who
attempted
to
study
him
were
as
much
perplexed
as
charmed
the
avidity
with
which
a
cheap
book
easily
read
professing
to
give
personal
recollections
of
such
a
man
would
be
seized
upon
by
the
mass
of
reading
people
was
not
overestimated
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
notice
to
discuss
choate
his
eloquence
his
wit
his
scholarship
or
his
personal
characteristics
our
office
is
simply
to
examine
the
manner
of
parker
performing
what
he
set
out
to
perform
our
business
is
with
the
book
not
with
the
subject
of
it
and
in
our
judgment
the
book
is
the
very
worst
that
could
well
be
written
on
such
a
subject
it
is
done
with
bad
taste
bad
judgment
bad
style
it
is
precisely
the
book
to
mortify
and
disgust
choate
admirers
and
to
fix
more
firmly
than
ever
such
unfavorable
notions
of
him
as
may
have
existed
in
the
minds
of
others
parker
does
not
appear
to
have
considered
what
he
undertook
when
he
stepped
so
lightly
into
the
position
of
the
biographer
of
such
a
man
we
will
not
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
a
really
just
and
discriminating
account
of
him
demanded
as
it
certainly
did
much
acuteness
of
perception
and
dexterity
of
delineation
together
with
a
high
degree
of
scholarship
what
we
are
now
specifying
against
the
author
is
that
he
took
no
care
whatever
to
set
any
wise
or
modest
bounds
to
his
enterprise
he
did
not
bear
in
mind
how
much
had
been
as
well
as
how
little
was
about
choate
what
wonderfully
loose
and
idle
notions
of
him
had
got
abroad
how
the
most
essential
and
notable
points
of
his
character
and
genius
had
been
so
clumsily
handled
by
flippant
or
careless
critics
that
the
popular
impression
of
him
was
to
a
great
degree
extravagant
and
absurd
remembering
all
this
and
properly
the
subject
in
which
he
appears
to
have
interested
himself
so
ardently
parker
should
have
applied
to
his
task
a
somewhat
gentle
hand
gratifying
if
that
must
be
done
the
curiosity
of
his
readers
as
far
as
he
safely
could
but
refraining
altogether
from
those
aspects
of
choate
mind
and
character
which
he
must
have
known
could
not
be
intelligently
discussed
in
a
book
so
swiftly
and
lightly
executed
no
such
notion
seems
to
have
occurred
to
him
he
has
rattled
off
his
reminiscences
with
a
confidence
which
may
be
justly
called
indecent
and
impertinent
the
result
is
what
might
have
been
expected
we
have
so
many
pages
of
voluble
superficial
and
exceedingly
tedious
talk
about
choate
and
that
is
the
whole
of
it
for
our
own
part
we
have
been
not
at
all
profited
by
the
reading
and
the
little
amusement
it
has
afforded
us
was
probably
not
exactly
designed
by
the
author
we
would
fain
be
excused
from
the
duty
of
remarking
upon
the
merely
literary
character
of
the
book
but
that
may
not
be
as
we
said
before
the
book
is
somewhere
in
the
literature
of
the
day
and
its
place
must
be
ascertained
the
following
gems
of
rhetoric
it
will
be
useful
for
that
end
to
notice
with
me
as
with
every
young
man
of
a
taste
that
way
he
talked
etc
he
was
always
booked
up
on
all
the
fresh
topics
etc
the
sparkle
and
flash
produced
by
a
battle
of
brains
newspaper
topics
of
erudition
and
magnificence
convulsive
humor
severity
sweetening
all
the
courts
through
which
he
revolved
the
alluding
to
an
unfortunate
female
witness
who
was
a
mother
though
never
married
two
names
chiefs
at
the
bar
not
to
forget
an
extraordinary
quotation
from
the
title
which
the
author
says
he
found
at
the
head
of
one
of
manuscript
plans
for
daily
study
in
these
words
ad
munus
nuper
now
it
must
really
in
justice
be
said
that
to
write
a
biography
of
choate
in
such
a
lingo
as
this
is
an
insult
to
the
subject
we
believe
we
are
fair
with
parker
style
indeed
where
it
is
not
relieved
by
such
barbarisms
as
we
have
quoted
it
purls
along
with
a
certain
weak
smartness
which
is
inexpressibly
tiresome
a
much
more
tolerable
book
however
would
be
spoiled
by
such
arrant
egotism
as
our
author
displays
on
every
page
we
are
never
rid
of
for
a
moment
wherever
choate
is
visible
parker
is
strutting
by
his
side
he
exhibits
indeed
all
the
intrusiveness
of
boswell
without
any
of
that
honest
admiration
of
his
distinguished
friend
which
makes
boswell
positively
respectable
a
single
illustration
of
this
weakness
is
so
apt
that
we
quote
it
choate
said
one
should
write
a
history
of
the
ancient
orators
there
is
no
book
in
all
my
library
where
i
can
find
all
there
is
extant
about
any
ancient
orator
he
earnestly
advised
the
author
to
undertake
it
in
pursuance
of
the
idea
an
article
on
appeared
in
a
review
as
a
beginning
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
the
satisfaction
it
gave
him
saying
it
was
a
new
revelation
to
him
for
he
never
hortensius
before
again
parker
is
continually
assuring
us
in
more
or
less
direct
terms
of
the
intimacy
which
existed
between
himself
and
choate
in
a
matter
of
this
sort
once
telling
is
enough
and
then
it
should
be
done
with
modesty
and
so
as
simply
to
assure
the
reader
of
the
genuineness
of
the
reminiscences
all
beyond
that
is
vulgar
one
more
remark
upon
parker
as
an
author
he
permits
himself
to
speak
of
individuals
of
decided
personal
and
public
dignity
with
quite
too
much
familiarity
this
is
of
course
nothing
more
than
an
offence
against
good
taste
but
it
is
so
prevalent
in
his
pages
that
we
can
not
omit
it
from
anything
like
a
summary
of
the
faults
which
they
display
and
none
of
our
young
authors
actual
or
potential
can
find
anywhere
else
a
more
striking
and
salutary
example
of
the
harm
which
such
a
one
can
do
to
himself
by
indulging
in
this
very
unbecoming
practice
we
have
yet
to
notice
parker
book
in
respect
to
its
success
as
an
attempt
at
biography
we
suppose
he
intended
to
draw
the
portrait
of
a
man
of
wit
eloquence
and
scholarship
he
constantly
assures
us
in
terms
that
choate
such
a
man
an
assurance
which
certainly
was
not
necessary
to
so
extensive
and
brilliant
a
reputation
if
he
had
stopped
there
he
would
at
least
have
done
no
harm
but
the
illustrations
which
he
gives
us
are
so
very
far
from
satisfactory
that
unless
choate
reputation
in
these
particulars
be
surrendered
for
which
we
are
not
quite
prepared
it
must
be
upon
the
ground
that
his
biographer
has
failed
entirely
to
appreciate
him
that
choate
was
for
instance
a
man
of
singularly
keen
and
delicate
wit
everybody
knows
but
we
believe
that
any
brother
advocate
who
ever
sat
at
the
same
courtroom
table
with
him
for
three
days
or
any
cultivated
person
who
ever
passed
an
evening
in
his
company
was
likely
to
hear
from
his
lips
in
that
space
of
time
more
real
wit
than
parker
repeats
in
his
whole
book
a
few
old
jokes
of
his
current
in
court
street
any
time
in
the
last
twenty
years
and
some
odd
and
extravagant
expressions
which
choate
may
have
permitted
himself
to
use
in
the
courtroom
to
divert
a
sullen
juror
such
turns
of
speech
as
certainly
never
thought
were
witty
though
they
raised
the
desired
laugh
at
the
time
to
which
he
resorted
only
as
a
necessary
but
to
himself
unpalatable
part
of
the
business
of
carrying
the
verdict
and
which
he
of
all
men
would
desire
to
have
forgotten
make
up
pretty
much
the
sum
of
illustrations
in
the
matter
of
wit
one
faculty
which
choate
possessed
in
a
remarkable
degree
that
of
ready
elegant
and
telling
quotation
of
which
many
interesting
instances
will
occur
to
every
one
and
which
in
the
hands
of
an
appreciative
biographer
would
have
furnished
a
topic
of
rare
entertainment
parker
scarcely
mentions
as
he
regards
or
at
any
rate
describes
choate
oratory
it
would
seem
to
have
consisted
altogether
in
unearthly
screams
jumping
up
and
down
tangled
hair
sweating
brow
glaring
eyes
etc
upon
these
things
which
his
discriminating
admirers
were
glad
to
overlook
as
mere
matters
of
temperament
and
constitution
and
in
spite
of
which
they
were
charmed
with
his
graceful
and
truly
vigorous
speech
his
biographer
loves
to
dwell
he
has
much
to
say
of
the
length
and
complexity
of
the
sentences
but
nothing
of
the
often
exquisite
elegance
of
their
structure
much
of
the
number
and
size
of
the
words
of
which
they
consisted
nothing
of
the
extreme
delicacy
and
dexterity
of
their
use
the
wonderful
completeness
with
which
they
were
made
to
express
every
particle
of
the
orator
meaning
as
to
choate
scholarship
we
certainly
learn
nothing
satisfactory
from
this
unfortunate
book
in
the
conversations
which
the
author
clumsily
indeed
but
we
are
bound
to
believe
faithfully
details
we
should
expect
to
find
something
of
the
rich
fruitage
of
a
cultivation
in
letters
but
so
poor
a
result
does
parker
show
in
this
part
of
his
work
that
he
drives
us
to
the
dilemma
either
of
placing
choate
in
quite
an
unworthy
rank
as
a
scholar
or
of
concluding
that
in
the
case
of
these
conversations
he
bestowed
upon
his
listener
very
little
of
any
particular
preciousness
or
that
what
else
was
bestowed
was
not
understood
or
remembered
so
as
to
be
recorded
we
can
not
dismiss
this
book
without
noticing
the
extremely
unhappy
treatment
which
the
personal
and
professional
character
of
choate
has
received
at
the
author
hands
that
he
should
have
introduced
into
it
as
he
has
done
such
stories
or
jokes
or
anecdotes
or
whatever
else
they
may
be
called
as
the
commonest
good
taste
or
good
sense
should
have
told
him
to
exclude
we
suppose
ought
in
charity
to
be
attributed
to
mere
uncontrollable
garrulity
but
he
has
also
completely
missed
some
of
the
most
obvious
and
familiar
characteristics
of
choate
and
his
description
of
others
which
he
professes
to
have
perceived
he
spoils
by
unseemly
and
unintelligent
illustration
we
have
not
the
patience
to
follow
him
through
this
part
of
his
performance
it
is
enough
to
say
that
none
who
knew
choate
would
ever
recognize
the
portrait
we
regret
extremely
that
parker
felt
himself
called
upon
to
write
and
print
his
reminiscences
he
has
done
himself
no
credit
whatever
but
that
is
comparatively
a
small
matter
the
book
is
in
every
way
an
injurious
and
indecorous
one
and
if
he
really
respects
the
fame
of
the
distinguished
man
whom
he
has
attempted
to
describe
he
must
agree
with
us
in
the
hope
that
his
own
work
may
be
forgotten
as
soon
as

the
duties
of
an
historian
always
difficult
are
peculiarly
so
when
he
attempts
to
treat
of
recent
events
in
such
a
case
the
historian
whose
mind
is
not
so
warped
by
sympathies
and
antipathies
as
to
make
him
utterly
incompetent
to
his
task
must
possess
a
rare
impartiality
of
judgment
and
extraordinary
keenness
of
insight
all
assisted
by
candid
and
painful
research
to
what
extent
these
qualities
are
united
in
ormsby
we
propose
to
inquire
we
are
at
first
favorably
impressed
ormsby
preface
is
most
striking
uniting
not
only
touching
candor
but
innocence
absolutely
refreshing
the
duties
of
historian
which
we
just
now
called
so
weighty
rest
lightly
upon
his
conscious
strength
the
historian
remarks
that
he
is
aware
that
his
outlines
are
very
imperfect
and
in
many
things
may
be
erroneous
he
has
had
no
access
to
libraries
or
public
documents
and
his
statistics
are
sometimes
given
from
general
recollection
and
are
but
approximations
to
accuracy
but
feeling
that
some
history
of
the
parties
of
this
country
is
needed
he
has
the
temerity
to
offer
this
till
its
place
shall
be
supplied
by
one
more
reliable
and
satisfactory
any
man
apology
for
deficiencies
in
his
book
may
be
accepted
provided
he
be
able
to
make
good
the
suppressed
premise
upon
which
after
all
the
whole
depends
namely
that
there
was
need
of
his
writing
at
all
ormsby
seems
to
think
there
was
but
gives
no
reasons
in
support
of
his
opinion
supposing
it
proved
however
it
might
be
gravely
debated
whether
the
fortunate
owner
of
this
book
would
have
any
advantage
over
the
man
so
unlucky
as
not
to
possess
it
we
have
all
heard
of
the
man
who
planned
a
house
on
so
magnificent
a
scale
that
when
the
porch
was
finished
the
funds
were
found
to
be
nearly
exhausted
and
the
main
body
of
the
house
had
to
be
built
much
smaller
than
the
porch
ormsby
has
avoided
this
error
his
porch
is
half
of
the
whole
structure
his
book
contains
pages
of
these
only
actually
less
than
half
are
devoted
to
porch
or
introductory
matter
this
part
is
richly
studded
with
blunders
of
every
description
and
written
in
language
which
for
copiousness
and
clearness
rivals
the
fertilizing
inundations
of
the
nile
the
decorous
appearance
of
impartiality
necessary
to
an
historian
is
well
preserved
by
such
choice
language
as
crusade
against
the
institutions
and
people
of
the
south
fratricidal
hand
in
sectional
warfare

arouse

and

and
it
is
to
the
stunted
obtuse
bigoted

jaundiced
and

in
the
north
that
seward
and
others
of
his
kidney
address
british
gold
a
favorite
phrase
cant
of
british
philanthropy
etc
ormsby
devotes
some
little
space
to
what
may
be
called
the
legitimate
object
of
his
work
that
is
the
vindication
of
the
distinctive
tariff
policy
of
the
whigs
and
here
advocates
a
good
cause
in
a
singularly
illogical
bungling
way
most
of
his
book
however
is
given
up
to
foolish
invective
against
british
machinations
in
the
united
states
an
idea
which
may
have
been
plausible
in
jefferson
time
but
has
long
been
abandoned
to
minds
of
our
author
calibre
and
to
arguments
against
the
republican
party
which
show
only
that
he
is
entirely
ignorant
of
the
doctrines
of
that
party
and
entirely
incompetent
to
understand
them
if
he
were
not
ignorant
we
can
present
only
a
few
specimens
taken
almost
at
random
from
the
pages
of
this
book
the
author
ignorance
omitting
the
frequent
instances
of
error
in
the
names
may
be
shown
by
his
ranking
johnson
of
kentucky
and
davy
crockett
among
the
eminent
statesmen
of
their
time
he
says
of
clay
when
in
as
a
senator
from
kentucky
he
sustained
adams
in
the
house
for
the
presidency
he
acted
etc
now
henry
clay
was
not
in
the
senate
at
any
time
between
march
and
march
moreover
if
he
had
been
he
could
not
have
voted
for
adams
as
ormsby
would
have
known
had
he
known
anything
of
the
constitution
to
which
he
professes
such
entire
devotion
of
the
missouri
compromise
he
says
it
was
an
arrangement
by
which
the
south
made
concessions
and
gained
nothing
if
we
are
to
adopt
the
principle
that
slavery
is
to
be
fostered
not
discouraged
the
south
did
make
concessions
the
essential
principle
of
the
republican
party
is
that
slavery
is
a
great
evil
and
brings
in
its
train
many
other
evils
and
that
the
legislation
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
be
warped
by
vain
attempts
to
save
the
interest
from
inevitable
disaster
by
systematic
injustice
to
the
other
interests
of
the
country
if
we
adopt
this
view
which
is
admitted
even
by
so
ardent
a
leader
as
senator
mason
of
virginia
to
have
been
the
view
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
then
the
south
gave
up
what
she
never
owned
and
was
paid
for
so
doing
and
taking
either
view
we
must
admit
that
she
has
since
by
the
act
revoked
the
grant
without
refunding
the
pay
ormsby
mentions
the
significant
and
highly
encouraging
fact
that
many
leading
democrats
including
hallett
whose
name
of
course
he
spells
incorrectly
declared
for
protection
in
the
campaign
of
his
taking
courage
from
so
insignificant
a
fact
as
any
of
these
gentlemen
declaring
for
any
serviceable
doctrine
in
a
campaign
shows
ormsby
to
be
by
no
means
intimately
acquainted
with
massachusetts
democracy
it
is
commonly
thought
that
general
taylor
nomination
kept
the
whigs
from
sinking
in
and
that
the
whig
party
died
in
of
trying
to
swallow
the
fugitive
slave
law
but
ormsby
thinks
taylor
hurt
them
and
that
the
baltimore
platform
was
too
he
frequently
alludes
to
garrison
and
phillips
as
republicans
although
nearly
every
other
adult
in
the
country
knows
that
they
are
bitter
opponents
of
that
party
says
that
seward
can
rely
only
upon
the
abolitionists
in
the
north
misunderstands
of
course
the
irrepressible
conflict
says
that
no
northern
editor
ventures
to
speak
or
write
against
personal
liberty
bills
although
probably
not
a
day
passes
without
their
being
assailed
by
a
dozen
in
new
england
alone
that
slaves
never
can
be
carried
into
new
mexico
although
they
have
been
carried
thither
and
slavery
has
even
been
declared
perpetual
by
enactment
of
the
territorial
legislature
and
speaking
of
kansas
that
president
buchanan
best
endeavors
to
secure
the
people
of
that
territory
equal
rights
were
thwarted
by
factionists
in
other
words
factionists
declined
to
admit
kansas
under
the
lecompton
constitution
forced
by
gross
frauds
upon
a
loathing
and
reluctant
people
he
adds
that
no
one
denies
buchanan
eminent
patriotism
and
statesmanship
now
whether
the
president
possesses
these
qualities
or
not
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
great
many
deny
them
to
him
and
so
ormsby
continues
heaping
blunder
upon
blunder
to
a
greater
length
than
we
can
follow
him
on
he
makes
this
following
unorthodox
statement
we
have
a
right
to
hate
and
detest
slavery
and
should
belie
our
natures
were
we
not
to
do
so
elsewhere
however
he
dwells
rapturously
upon
the
happy
lot
of
the
slave
the
apparent
inconsistency
is
explained
on
we
will
not
insult
our
understandings
by
doubting
the
great
enormity
of
so
foul
a
thing
as
human
bondage
in
regard
to
detestation
of
slavery
there
is
no
difference
between
the
people
of
the
north
and
south
but
these
two
people
differ
widely
in
their
feelings
in
regard
to
negro
servitude
oh
that
is
it
then
vast
is
the
difference
between
human
bondage
and
negro
servitude
ormsby
argument
is
aimed
against
the
republicans
accordingly
he
assails
the
abolitionists
now
we
do
not
find
fault
with
him
because
his
arguments
are
pitiably
silly
because
an
intelligent
abolitionist
would
refute
them
instantly
but
because
even
if
they
were
sound
they
have
no
bearing
upon
his
point
they
are
not
only
nonsensical
but
irrelevant
for
the
ignorance
of
the
southerners
says
our
author
we
should
pity
them
and
send
them
our
schoolmasters
who
in
happy
years
past
have
ever
found
a
cordial
reception
exactly
so
in
happy
years
he
then
innocently
asks
is
it
strange
that
the
south
should
think
it
necessary
that
she
should
have
the
ascendency
in
at
least
one
branch
of
the
national
government
oh
no
not
at
all
but
as
republicans
consider
it
necessary
is
it
strange
that
they
should
vote
as
they
think
here
is
a
sample
of
most
eminently
logical
reasoning
the
powerful
efforts
made
by
the
british
government
to
suppress
the
have
been
far
from
successful
the
exportation
of
negroes
from
africa
has
not
been
discontinued
but
the
sufferings
of
the
middle
passage
have
been
increased
twofold
that
an
attempt
to
thwart
by
legislation
the
decrees
of
providence
is
of
but
little
if
murder
were
frequent
in
new
york
and
an
insufficient
force
called
out
to
suppress
it
the
consequence
being
only
more
bloodshed
ormsby
to
be
consistent
would
have
to
say
it
was
not
well
to
try
to
suppress
murder
the
event
showing
it
to
be
only
a
futile
legislative
attempt
to
thwart
the
decrees
of
providence
not
that
any
whig
was
more
in
favor
of
the
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories
by
the
general
government
than
fremont
or
the
best
republican
at
his
back
but
the
idea
of
the
formation
of
a
party
based
on
the
slavery
question
could
not
be
entertained
for
a
moment
by
any
one
imbued
with
genuine
whig
sentiments
pp
there
is
precisely
the
old
argument
of
timid
conservatism
although
its
champions
are
seldom
unskilful
enough
to
advance
it
in
a
form
so
easily
dealt
with
you
may
be
bitterly
opposed
forsooth
to
the
extension
of
slavery
but
you
must
not
organize
or
even
vote
against
it
where
then
is
the
good
of
being
opposed
to
it
the
object
of
all
this
bad
logic
bad
history
and
bad
language
is
to
attack
the
republicans
and
advocate
the
claims
of
modern
democracy
not
the
democracy
of
jefferson
and
silas
wright
but
of
cushing
and
buchanan
and
what
is
the
conclusion
what
is
the
mission
of
the
surviving
whigs
the
existence
of
a
conservative
enlightened
and
patriotic
opposition
party
is
the
necessary
condition
of
the
existence
of
the
democracy
as
a
national
party
the
slightest
reflection
after
even
a
superficial
observation
of
the
condition
of
our
country
will
satisfy
any
candid
person
of
ordinary
ability
that
the
reconstruction
of
the
whig
party
is
indispensable
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
the
democratic
party
though
now
national
if
left
to
the
sole
opposition
of
the
republican
which
is
a
sectional
party
must
inevitably
sooner
or
later
itself
degenerate
into
sectionalism
this
must
be
the
necessary
result
of
such
antagonism
but
a
party
based
upon
intelligence
and
moral
worth
most
of
the
time
be
in
the
minority
of
the
country
and
much
of
the
time
exceedingly
small
this
the
whigs
see
and
readily
accept
the
conditions
of
their
pp
this
then
is
the
banquet
to
which
we
are
invited
the
mission
of
the
resuscitated
whig
party
is
to
be
not
gaining
any
victory
but
being
beaten
by
the
democrats
it
is
important
to
the
nationality
of
the
democratic
party
that
they
have
a
sound
and
national
opposition
for
them
to
defeat
regularly
year
after
year
and
this
want
the
whigs
are
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
supply

all

guiana
and
some
parts
of
central
america
taken
on
a
hasty
tour
during
the
winter
and
spring
of
last
year
its
style
is
by
no
means
so
good
as
that
of
which
trollope
has
shown
himself
the
master
in
his
popular
novels
it
is
disfigured
by
carlylisms
and
other
inelegancies
and
bears
many
marks
of
negligence
and
haste
with
a
little
pains
trollope
might
have
made
his
book
much
better
and
of
much
more
permanent
value
in
spite
of
a
sense
of
real
humor
he
sometimes
falls
into
heavy
attempts
at
smartness
and
fun
and
although
he
has
a
quick
eye
for
the
essential
traits
of
character
he
not
infrequently
runs
into
trivial
details
in
travelling
with
him
one
is
not
quite
certain
whether
his
companion
is
a
gentleman
breakfasts
lunches
and
dinners
hold
a
great
place
in
his
thoughts
he
gives
far
too
much
attention
to
and
the
varieties
of
drinking
and
eating
in
general
he
has
neither
the
ease
nor
the
which
mark
the
thoroughly
man
of
the
world
but
he
is
nevertheless
amusing
and
likable
the
chief
merit
of
his
book
arises
from
the
fact
that
he
has
seen
much
and
many
parts
of
the
world
has
been
a
student
of
life
and
manners
and
thus
has
acquired
skill
in
observation
and
facility
of
comparison
the
conclusions
which
he
draws
from
what
he
sees
may
be
right
or
wrong
but
he
knows
well
how
to
state
what
has
come
to
his
notice
and
his
readers
may
get
from
his
pictures
many
valuable
indications
in
regard
to
men
and
to
social
conditions
whether
they
accept
his
conclusions
or
not
the
state
of
the
british
west
indies
is
one
of
peculiar
interest
at
the
present
day
both
in
a
social
and
an
economical
point
of
view
the
great
questions
opened
by
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
in
these
islands
in
are
not
yet
settled
and
upon
the
solution
of
the
problems
now
being
worked
out
there
depends
not
only
their
own
future
but
also
in
great
measure
the
future
of
all
the
countries
in
which
slavery
still
exists
if
the
results
of
emancipation
prove
on
the
whole
advantageous
both
to
masters
and
slaves
the
question
of
the
universal
and
comparatively
speedy
abolition
of
slavery
would
be
virtually
decided
if
however
it
should
be
shown
that
the
results
in
the
long
run
are
disastrous
both
to
whites
and
blacks
or
to
either
of
these
classes
then
although
no
one
can
doubt
that
slavery
must
sooner
or
later
be
done
away
with
wherever
it
now
exists
the
time
of
its
abolition
may
be
indefinitely
postponed
and
other
means
of
accomplishing
it
must
be
devised
and
adopted
than
those
which
the
example
of
the
west
indies
will
have
proved
injurious
as
in
regard
to
all
matters
which
have
been
vehemently
discussed
the
accounts
in
regard
to
the
effects
of
emancipation
in
the
west
indies
differ
widely
but
the
weight
of
authority
tends
to
show
that
putting
aside
for
the
moment
all
moral
considerations
the
scale
inclines
towards
the
side
of
good
trollope
who
writes
without
prejudice
may
be
taken
as
a
fair
witness
so
far
as
his
opportunities
for
observation
extended
and
as
his
views
will
not
satisfy
the
warm
partisans
of
either
side
it
may
perhaps
be
assumed
that
they
are
in
the
main
correct
in
his
chapter
on
the
black
men
in
jamaica
he
says
i
shall
be
asked
having
said
so
much
whether
i
think
that
emancipation
was
wrong
by
no
means
i
think
that
emancipation
was
clearly
right
but
i
think
that
we
expected
far
too
great
and
far
too
quick
a
result
from
emancipation
these
people
the
negroes
are
a
servile
race
fitted
by
nature
for
the
hardest
physical
work
and
apparently
at
present
fitted
for
little
else
some
thirty
years
since
they
were
in
a
state
where
such
work
was
their
lot
but
their
tasks
were
exacted
from
them
in
a
condition
of
bondage
abhorrent
to
the
feelings
of
the
age
and
opposed
to
the
religion
which
we
practised
for
us
thinking
as
we
did
slavery
was
a
sin
from
that
sin
we
have
cleansed
ourselves
but
the
mere
fact
of
doing
so
has
not
freed
us
from
our
difficulties
nor
was
it
to
be
expected
that
it
should
the
discontinuance
of
a
sin
is
always
the
commencement
of
a
struggle
this
is
well
said
the
negroes
freed
from
the
bondage
of
labor
suddenly
becoming
masters
of
themselves
with
simple
and
easily
satisfied
wants
with
abundant
means
of
subsistence
to
be
procured
at
the
expense
of
the
least
possible
effort
exposed
to
no
competition
from
the
pressure
of
population
and
endowed
by
nature
with
indolent
temperaments
naturally
took
to
leading
idle
and
easy
lives
and
refused
to
work
except
at
their
own
pleasure
they
had
as
a
class
no
desire
of
regular
and
continued
occupation
and
little
sense
of
the
worth
of
work
in
itself
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
this
and
the
blacks
were
little
to
be
blamed
for
it
but
the
world
will
not
advance
unless
men
work
and
any
country
where
there
is
not
a
sufficient
stimulus
for
labor
is
in
the
course
of
decline
the
inevitable
results
followed
in
the
west
indies
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
labor
in
jamaica
the
largest
and
most
important
of
these
british
islands
other
and
widely
different
causes
mistakes
in
legislation
previous
financial
embarrassment
and
especially
the
unwillingness
or
inability
of
the
planters
to
recognize
the
necessities
of
their
altered
position
contributed
to
bring
about
a
condition
of
wretched
adversity
estates
went
out
of
cultivation
expensive
establishments
failed
roads
were
disused
and
the
island
was
full
of
the
signs
of
decay
the
negroes
indeed
were
happy
a
few
work
in
the
course
of
the
year
secured
them
subsistence
and
irregular
labor
for
wages
on
the
plantations
of
their
old
masters
gave
them
the
means
of
gratifying
their
liking
for
dress
and
finery
a
full
generation
has
not
yet
passed
since
the
act
of
emancipation
but
there
are
already
indications
that
this
transitional
condition
is
drawing
to
an
end
a
portion
at
least
of
the
negroes
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
responsibilities
as
well
as
the
privileges
of
liberty
to
seek
employment
for
the
sake
of
raising
themselves
and
their
children
in
the
social
scale
and
to
accumulate
property
they
are
not
merely
free
but
are
becoming
independent
still
the
number
of
those
who
live
from
hand
to
mouth
in
the
indolent
and
useless
possession
of
freedom
is
very
great
in
trollope
opinion
little
is
to
be
expected
from
the
blacks
to
lie
in
the
sun
and
eat
and
yams
is
the
idea
of
being
free
such
freedom
as
that
has
not
been
intended
for
man
in
this
world
and
i
say
that
jamaica
as
it
now
exists
is
still
under
a
devil
ordinance
education
is
a
slow
process
with
the
blacks
but
in
jamaica
as
elsewhere
where
slavery
exists
there
is
a
race
neither
black
nor
white
but
of
mixed
blood
important
in
numbers
and
important
also
from
possessing
a
mingling
of
the
qualities
of
its
progenitors
which
seems
to
fit
it
peculiarly
for
the
prosperous
occupation
of
the
tropics
supposing
this
colored
race
to
have
the
power
of
continuing
itself
through
successive
generations
a
problem
which
is
as
yet
unsolved
it
would
seem
as
if
the
future
of
these
islands
were
mainly
in
its
hands
of
pure
whites
there
are
not
more
than
fifteen
thousand
in
jamaica
of
the
mixed
race
there
are
said
to
be
seventy
thousand
before
the
abolition
of
slavery
their
position
was
one
of
degradation
since
the
abolition
it
has
greatly
improved
they
are
still
looked
upon
with
disdain
by
their
white
brothers
and
sisters
but
they
are
forcing
themselves
into
social
recognition
and
equality
these
people
marry
now
said
a
lady
to
trollope
but
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
never
thought
of
looking
to
that
at
all
there
is
matter
for
reflection
as
well
as
for
satisfaction
in
that
sentence
but
as
yet
the
condition
of
jamaica
is
such
as
may
well
excite
doubt
as
to
the
possibility
of
its
recovery
from
the
misfortunes
under
which
it
has
suffered
misfortunes
due
quite
as
much
to
the
evils
of
preëxisting
slavery
as
to
the
blow
given
to
its
prosperity
by
the
act
of
emancipation
are
englishmen
in
general
aware
asks
trollope
that
half
the
in
jamaica
and
i
believe
more
than
half
the
have
gone
back
into
a
state
of
bush
that
all
this
land
rich
with
the
richest
produce
only
some
thirty
years
since
has
now
fallen
back
into
wilderness
still
if
the
experiment
of
emancipation
be
considered
doubtful
or
disastrous
so
far
as
jamaica
is
concerned
it
can
not
be
esteemed
so
in
regard
to
the
chief
remaining
islands
in
barbadoes
for
instance
there
was
no
for
the
blacks
the
negro
was
obliged
to
work
or
starve
labor
was
consequently
abundant
and
there
is
not
a
rood
of
waste
land
in
the
island
even
here
numerous
as
are
the
negroes
they
certainly
live
an
easier
life
than
that
of
an
english
laborer
earn
their
money
with
more
facility
and
are
more
independent
of
their
masters
in
the
report
made
by
the
governor
of
the
island
in
he
states
so
far
the
success
of
cultivation
by
free
labor
in
barbadoes
is
unquestionable
trinidad
of
which
but
a
comparatively
small
part
has
been
cultivated
and
where
the
negroes
have
displayed
the
same
indisposition
to
labor
as
in
jamaica
is
however
flourishing
its
prosperity
seems
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
during
the
last
few
years
some
ten
or
twelve
thousand
coolies
have
been
brought
from
the
east
indies
and
have
supplied
the
demand
for
labor
in
british
guiana
or
demerara
on
the
main
land
the
same
fact
has
brought
about
a
similar
result
the
emancipated
negro
could
not
be
depended
upon
for
regular
work
he
established
himself
on
his
small
freehold
and
lived
like
theodore
hook
in
idleness
and
ease
but
for
some
years
past
laborers
have
been
brought
in
freely
from
india
and
china
and
the
fertile
colony
is
now
in
a
state
of
abundant
prosperity
trollope
seems
to
us
to
refute
effectually
the
notion
so
far
at
least
as
regards
the
british
west
indies
that
this
cooly
immigration
is
only
slavery
under
another
name
on
their
arrival
in
demerara
he
says
the
coolies
are
distributed
among
the
planters
by
the
governor
to
each
planter
according
to
his
application
his
means
of
providing
for
them
and
his
willingness
and
ability
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
immigration
by
yearly
instalments
footnote
we
quote
from
an
extract
in
an
able
article
in
the
for
april
entitled
west
indies
as
they
were
and
they
are
sent
to
no
estate
till
a
government
officer
shall
have
reported
that
there
are
houses
for
them
to
occupy
there
must
be
a
hospital
for
them
on
the
estate
and
a
regular
doctor
with
a
sufficient
salary
the
rate
of
their
wages
is
stipulated
and
their
hours
of
work
though
the
contract
is
for
five
years
they
can
leave
the
estate
at
the
end
of
the
first
three
transferring
their
services
to
any
other
master
and
at
the
end
of
the
five
years
they
are
entitled
to
a
free
passage
home
the
women
are
coming
now
as
well
as
the
men
and
they
have
learned
to
husband
their
means
and
put
money
together
we
pass
over
the
other
british
west
indies
though
animated
sketches
tempt
us
to
linger
the
main
conclusion
to
which
this
part
of
his
book
leads
is
that
this
question
of
labor
is
the
one
upon
which
the
results
of
emancipation
hinge
unless
moved
by
necessity
the
negro
is
disinclined
to
work
slavery
has
rendered
labor
offensive
to
him
and
his
own
nature
inclines
him
to
idleness
the
pressure
of
population
as
in
barbadoes
may
compel
him
for
his
own
good
to
labor
or
he
may
as
in
demerara
be
superseded
by
other
workmen
if
left
to
himself
his
tendency
seems
to
be
to
sink
into
sensuality
rather
than
to
rise
in
civilization
by
his
own
efforts
the
condition
of
the
mass
of
the
negroes
is
undoubtedly
a
happier
one
than
in
the
days
of
slavery
but
it
may
be
fairly
doubted
whether
emancipation
has
led
to
any
moral
improvement
in
the
race
how
far
a
forced
system
of
labor
for
wages
might
answer
for
the
blacks
how
far
a
regular
and
organized
plan
of
education
might
elevate
them
how
far
the
danger
of
their
relapse
into
barbarism
might
be
obviated
by
preliminary
precautions
are
questions
which
that
country
which
next
undertakes
emancipation
must
solve
for
itself
and
which
the
example
of
the
british
west
indies
will
give
some
of
the
means
for
solving
in
a
satisfactory
manner
mr
trollope
book
is
well
worth
reading
by
those
who
would
prepare
themselves
by
knowledge
and
by
reflection
for
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
advantages
and
the
evils
of
giving
unlimited
freedom
to
a
race
that
has
been
long
enslaved
there
is
less
interest
in
his
account
of
central
america
than
in
the
other
parts
of
his
volume
the
ground
is
more
familiar
to
american
readers
and
some
of
our
own
travellers
have
given
descriptions
of
the
country
far
more
thorough
and
not
less
entertaining
of
cuba
which
he
trusts
may
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
be
some
day
transferred
to
american
keeping
he
says
but
little
and
after
dana
late
excellent
though
hasty
sketches
of
the
island
that
author
must
have
more
than
common
ability
who
can
with
hope
of
success
venture
over
the
same
ground
public
life
of
captain
john
by
james
redpath
with
an
autobiography
of
his
childhood
and
youth
boston
pp
it
would
have
been
well
had
this
book
never
been
written
redpath
has
understood
neither
the
opportunities
opened
to
him
nor
the
responsibilities
laid
upon
him
in
being
permitted
to
write
the
authorized
life
of
john
brown
his
book
in
whatever
light
it
is
viewed
whether
as
the
biography
of
a
remarkable
man
as
an
historic
narrative
of
a
series
of
extraordinary
and
important
events
or
simply
as
a
mere
piece
of
literary
jobwork
is
equally
unsatisfactory
he
has
shown
himself
incompetent
to
appreciate
the
character
of
the
man
whom
he
admires
and
he
has
consequently
done
great
wrong
to
his
memory
there
never
was
more
need
for
a
good
life
of
any
man
than
there
was
for
one
of
john
brown
the
whole
country
was
curious
to
learn
about
him
and
to
be
told
his
story
those
who
thought
the
best
of
him
and
those
who
thought
the
worst
were
alike
desirous
to
know
more
of
him
than
the
newspapers
had
furnished
and
to
become
acquainted
with
the
course
of
his
life
and
the
training
which
had
prepared
him
for
kansas
and
brought
him
to
harper
ferry
whatever
view
be
taken
of
his
character
he
was
a
man
so
remarkable
as
to
be
well
worthy
of
study
in
the
bitter
and
excited
state
of
public
feeling
in
regard
to
him
there
was
but
one
way
in
which
his
life
could
be
properly
told
and
that
way
was
to
allow
him
as
far
as
possible
to
tell
it
in
his
own
words
for
that
part
of
his
life
which
there
were
no
letters
of
his
to
illustrate
his
biographer
should
have
been
content
to
state
facts
in
the
simplest
and
most
careful
manner
entering
into
no
controversy
and
keeping
himself
entirely
out
of
sight
thus
only
could
john
brown
character
produce
its
due
effect
his
letters
from
prison
had
shown
that
he
was
a
master
of
the
homeliest
and
strongest
english
his
words
said
what
they
meant
and
they
were
understood
by
everybody
he
had
found
them
in
the
bible
and
had
been
familiar
with
them
all
his
life
whatever
he
was
he
could
have
told
us
better
than
any
other
man
and
he
was
the
only
man
who
would
have
been
listened
to
with
much
confidence
concerning
himself
redpath
has
very
unfortunately
thought
differently
he
has
not
taken
pains
to
collect
even
all
the
letters
of
john
brown
which
had
been
previously
published
he
has
written
in
the
worst
temper
and
spirit
of
partisanship
so
that
with
every
cautious
reader
doubts
attend
many
statements
which
rest
only
on
his
authority
he
has
thrust
himself
continually
forward
and
he
has
exercised
no
proper
care
in
arranging
his
materials
the
truth
is
that
a
life
of
brown
was
not
now
needed
for
those
who
already
admired
the
stalwart
nature
of
the
man
even
though
they
might
deplore
his
course
for
those
who
had
had
their
hearts
touched
and
stirred
by
his
manliness
his
truth
his
courage
and
his
unwavering
fidelity
to
conscience
and
faith
in
god
but
it
was
greatly
needed
for
that
much
larger
class
the
mass
of
the
northern
community
timidity
had
been
startled
at
his
rash
attempt
whose
sympathy
had
been
more
or
less
awakened
by
his
bearing
and
his
death
but
who
were
and
are
in
a
painful
state
of
perplexity
in
the
endeavor
to
reconcile
their
abhorrence
or
at
least
their
disapproval
of
his
attack
on
virginia
with
their
sense
of
the
admirable
nature
of
the
qualities
he
displayed
it
was
needed
also
for
the
very
large
class
who
received
from
the
newspapers
but
a
confused
and
imperfect
account
of
the
events
which
took
place
in
virginia
from
october
to
december
and
who
according
to
their
political
predilections
condemn
or
applaud
the
course
of
captain
brown
and
above
all
it
was
needed
for
the
men
who
have
disgraced
themselves
by
denying
to
brown
the
possession
of
any
virtues
and
who
have
outstripped
his
southern
enemies
in
applying
to
him
the
most
opprobrious
and
the
falsest
epithets
now
none
of
these
classes
will
book
reach
with
effect
its
tone
is
such
it
is
so
violent
so
extravagant
that
it
will
offend
all
men
even
those
who
have
known
how
to
hold
a
steady
and
clear
opinion
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
of
the
popular
mind
who
have
not
applauded
brown
acts
of
violence
and
have
condemned
his
judgment
but
who
have
nevertheless
honored
what
was
noble
in
him
and
sympathized
with
him
in
his
strong
love
of
liberty
who
while
acknowledging
him
guilty
under
the
law
mourned
that
the
law
should
not
be
tempered
with
mercy
and
who
have
recognized
in
him
at
once
the
excellences
and
the
errors
of
an
enthusiast
those
who
have
most
faithfully
endeavored
to
find
the
truth
concerning
him
though
they
will
obtain
some
interesting
information
from
redpath
book
will
be
the
most
dissatisfied
with
it
it
has
always
been
among
the
offences
of
the
abolitionists
to
abuse
the
force
of
words
and
to
make
exclusive
pretensions
to
virtue
and
the
love
of
liberty
this
book
is
written
in
the
spirit
and
style
of
an
abolition
tract
in
representing
john
brown
as
little
more
than
a
mere
hero
of
the
abolitionists
the
author
has
done
essential
disservice
to
the
cause
of
freedom
and
to
the
memory
of
a
man
who
was
as
free
from
as
he
was
from
personal
ambitions
although
john
brown
character
was
a
simple
one
a
long
time
must
pass
before
it
will
be
generally
understood
and
justice
be
done
to
it
the
passion
and
the
prejudice
which
the
later
acts
of
his
life
have
excited
can
not
die
away
for
years
redpath
has
done
his
best
to
perpetuate
them
in
seasons
of
excitement
and
amid
the
struggles
of
political
contention
the
men
who
use
the
most
extravagant
and
the
most
violent
words
have
for
a
time
the
advantage
but
in
the
long
run
they
damage
whatever
cause
they
may
adopt
and
the
truth
which
their
declamations
have
obscured
or
their
falsehoods
have
violated
finally
asserts
itself
in
our
country
the
worth
and
the
strength
of
temperance
and
moderation
of
speech
seem
to
be
peculiarly
forgotten
words
which
should
stand
for
things
are
too
commonly
used
with
no
respect
to
their
essential
meaning
political
debates
are
embittered
personal
feeling
wounded
the
tone
of
manners
lowered
and
national
character
degraded
by
this
disregard
of
words
as
the
symbol
and
expression
of
truth
moderation
is
brought
into
disrepute
and
justice
fairness
and
honesty
of
opinion
tendered
as
rare
as
they
are
difficult
of
attainment
the
manner
in
which
john
brown
has
been
spoken
of
affords
the
plainest
illustration
of
these
facts
extravagance
in
condemnation
has
been
answered
by
extravagance
in
praise
of
his
life
and
deeds
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
novel
part
of
redpath
book
is
the
letter
written
by
john
brown
in
giving
some
account
of
his
early
life
it
is
in
all
respects
a
remarkable
composition
it
exhibits
the
main
influences
by
which
his
character
was
formed
it
affords
a
key
to
the
history
of
his
life
it
illustrates
the
nature
of
the
social
institutions
under
which
such
a
man
could
grow
up
and
it
shows
his
natural
traits
before
they
had
become
hardened
and
trained
under
the
discipline
of
later
experience
and
circumstance
nothing
has
been
more
marked
in
the
various
exhibitions
of
his
character
as
they
have
come
successively
to
view
than
their
complete
consistency
this
letter
this
account
of
his
youth
squares
perfectly
with
what
we
know
of
his
manhood
the
whole
of
it
should
be
read
by
all
who
would
understand
the
man
with
his
native
faculty
of
command
with
his
mingled
sternness
and
tenderness
with
his
large
heart
his
steadfast
will
the
base
of
his
soul
was
truth
and
the
motive
power
of
his
life
faith
in
the
justice
of
god
he
was
a
man
of
a
rare
type
so
rare
in
our
times
as
to
seem
like
a
man
of
another
age
he
belonged
to
the
same
class
with
the
scottish
covenanters
and
the
english
regicides
he
belonged
to
the
great
company
of
those
who
have
followed
the
footsteps
of
gideon
and
forgot
that
the
armory
of
the
lord
contained
other
weapons
than
the
sword
he
belonged
to
those
who
from
time
to
time
have
adopted
some
cause
the
good
old
cause
and
have
shrunk
from
no
sacrifice
which
it
required
at
their
hands
i
have
now
been
confined
over
a
month
wrote
john
brown
to
his
children
in
one
of
that
most
affecting
series
of
letters
from
his
prison
with
a
good
opportunity
to
look
the
whole
thing
as
fair
in
the
face
as
i
am
capable
of
doing
and
i
now
feel
most
grateful
that
i
am
counted
in
the
least
possible
degree
worthy
to
suffer
for
the
truth
suffering
is
a
gift
not
given
to
every
one
wrote
one
of
the
covenanters
who
was
hanged
in
the
grassmarket
in
edinburgh
in
and
i
desire
to
bless
god
name
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
that
he
has
counted
such
a
poor
thing
as
i
am
worthy
of
the
gift
of
suffering
that
john
brown
was
wrong
in
his
attempt
to
break
up
slavery
by
violence
few
will
deny
but
it
was
a
wrong
committed
by
a
good
man
by
one
who
dreaded
the
vengeance
of
the
almighty
and
forgot
his
his
errors
were
the
result
of
want
of
patience
and
want
of
imagination
and
he
paid
the
penalty
for
them
he
had
faith
in
the
divine
ordering
of
the
affairs
of
this
world
but
he
forgot
that
the
processes
by
which
evils
like
that
of
slavery
are
done
away
are
that
to
be
effectual
they
must
be
slow
that
wrong
is
no
remedy
for
wrong
he
was
an
anachronism
and
met
the
fate
of
all
anachronisms
that
strive
to
stem
and
divert
the
present
current
by
modes
which
the
world
has
outgrown
but
now
that
he
and
those
dearest
to
him
have
so
bitterly
expiated
his
faults
both
charity
and
justice
demand
that
his
virtues
should
be
honored
and
he
himself
mourned
it
will
be
a
gloomy
indication
of
the
poor
low
spirit
of
our
days
if
fear
and
falsehood
if
passion
or
indifference
should
cause
the
lesson
of
john
brown
life
to
be
neglected
or
should
check
a
natural
sympathy
with
the
noble
heart
of
the
old
man
that
lesson
is
not
for
any
one
part
of
the
country
more
than
another
that
sympathy
may
be
given
by
the
south
as
well
as
by
the
north
it
is
not
sympathy
for
his
acts
but
for
the
spirit
of
his
life
and
the
heroism
of
his
death
the
lesson
of
manliness
uprightness
and
courage
which
his
life
teaches
is
to
be
learned
by
us
not
merely
as
lovers
of
liberty
not
as
opponents
of
slavery
but
as
men
who
need
more
manliness
more
uprightness
more
courage
and
simplicity
in
our
common
lives
all
that
is
possible
of
apology
for
john
brown
is
to
be
found
in
his
letters
and
in
his
speech
to
the
court
before
his
sentence
it
is
perhaps
too
soon
to
hope
that
these
letters
and
this
speech
will
be
read
with
candor
and
a
feeling
of
human
brotherhood
by
those
who
now
look
with
abhorrence
or
with
indifference
on
his
memory
but
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
be
held
at
their
true
worth
by
all
as
the
expressions
of
a
large
tender
soul
when
they
will
be
read
with
sympathetic
pity
even
by
those
who
still
find
it
difficult
to
forgive
their
author
for
his
offence
against
society
these
letters
appeal
to
the
better
nature
of
every
man
and
woman
in
america
and
it
will
be
a
sad
thing
if
their
appeal
be
disregarded
we
trust
that
before
long
a
fairer
and
fuller
biography
than
that
by
redpath
will
remove
the
obstacle
which
this
book
now
presents
to
the
general
appreciation
of
the
character
and
life
of
john
brown
by
sydney
dobell
boston
ticknor
fields
many
of
dobell
poems
have
passages
which
are
musical
vigorous
and
peculiar
and
hardly
in
any
part
can
he
be
justly
charged
with
prolonging
an
echo
he
is
not
one
of
the
many
that
infest
the
groves
at
the
foot
of
parnassus
though
portions
of
his
songs
be
wild
fitful
and
incoherent
they
gush
with
the
force
and
feeling
of
a
heart
loyal
to
its
intuitions
and
thus
many
strains
captivate
and
keep
the
tuneful
ear
yet
such
charming
lines
make
conspicuous
the
want
of
that
high
appreciation
of
form
and
proportion
without
which
any
felicity
of
touch
in
the
treatment
of
details
will
only
cause
the
consummate
master
to
grieve
over
glorious
forms
that
have
no
effective
grouping
and
turn
away
from
colors
however
exquisite
that
are
strewn
as
it
were
on
a
palette
rather
than
wrought
into
picture
and
harmonized
to
the
tone
of
life
the
truth
is
that
the
grandly
designing
hand
is
nowhere
completely
visible
in
the
poetry
of
young
england
many
of
her
more
youthful
poets
show
a
mass
of
rich
materials
but
they
appear
to
have
been
upheaved
by
convulsions
us
with
their
splendor
while
like
lava
pouring
from
a
volcano
crater
they
take
no
prescribed
channel
they
flow
into
no
immortal
mould
it
is
this
fiery
gleam
on
the
surface
of
matter
hot
from
chaos
which
the
multitude
honor
as
the
highest
manifestation
of
genius
but
this
is
to
desecrate
a
word
which
implies
constructive
power
of
the
first
order
form
is
its
highest
expression
without
the
shaping
faculty
which
artistically
rounds
to
perfection
no
glitter
of
decoration
nor
even
force
and
fire
of
expression
can
keep
the
work
from
falling
into
ruins
if
the
beautiful
as
goethe
said
includes
in
it
the
good
then
perfect
beauty
alone
is
everlasting
this
is
a
rigorous
rule
for
anything
which
man
has
made
but
it
does
not
try
othello
so
severely
as
balder
and
balder
is
not
utterly
crushed
by
it
there
are
scenes
in
this
drama
and
also
in
the
roman
which
will
not
soon
lose
their
significance
or
easily
melt
out
of
the
memory
good
fight
and
other
by
charles
keade
new
york
harper
brothers
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
youth
named
gerard
a
native
of
tergou
in
holland
loved
margaret
the
daughter
of
peter
a
learned
man
of
the
neighboring
village
of
zevenbergen
expecting
immediate
marriage
their
intimacy
was
restrained
by
no
limits
the
interference
of
gerard
relations
however
separated
them
for
a
time
during
which
the
young
man
visited
rome
and
gained
some
distinction
as
a
transcriber
of
ancient
manuscripts
learning
after
a
while
that
he
was
about
to
return
his
kindred
caused
a
false
report
of
death
to
be
conveyed
to
him
and
by
thus
crushing
all
the
hopes
of
his
young
life
had
the
final
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
take
priestly
orders
which
threw
his
patrimony
into
their
hands
having
broken
two
hearts
and
brought
a
world
of
shame
upon
an
innocent
girl
to
get
it
it
is
only
fair
to
suppose
they
enjoyed
it
with
tranquillity
margaret
left
alone
gave
birth
to
a
child
the
greatness
of
whose
manhood
might
have
softened
the
remembrance
of
her
earlier
sorrows
had
she
lived
to
witness
it
but
she
died
when
he
was
thirteen
years
old
gerard
her
true
husband
who
had
never
rejoined
her
while
living
also
died
within
a
brief
space
the
son
they
left
was
the
famous
erasmus
reade
has
taken
this
little
record
which
would
never
have
become
historical
but
for
the
accidental
consequence
of
the
loves
of
gerard
and
margaret
and
wrought
it
into
a
story
of
exquisite
grace
and
delicacy
a
dead
and
fact
he
has
warmed
it
into
fresh
life
and
given
it
all
the
beauties
with
which
his
brilliant
imagination
could
endow
it
though
shorter
and
simpler
than
most
it
is
certainly
inferior
to
none
of
his
other
works
perhaps
its
simplicity
is
its
first
merit
the
extravagant
peculiarities
of
style
which
overlaid
his
two
longest
books
have
almost
entirely
disappeared
in
this
here
the
narration
is
for
the
most
part
as
unostentatious
as
the
events
are
natural
but
its
power
is
remarkable
although
the
regularity
with
which
the
incidents
follow
one
another
is
such
that
they
may
all
be
anticipated
yet
the
interest
in
them
never
fades
there
is
nothing
startlingly
new
in
the
entire
story
on
the
contrary
it
follows
pretty
closely
the
old
formula
of
troubled
until
the
closing
chapter
when
triumphant
virtue
sets
in
but
this
takes
nothing
from
the
effect
all
is
so
clear
and
vivid
in
description
so
glittering
with
gleams
of
wit
relieved
by
soft
shadows
of
purest
pathos
so
full
of
the
spirit
of
tender
humanity
that
the
reader
finds
no
reason
to
complain
except
that
the
end
is
so
speedily
reached
the
author
has
sacrificed
history
in
his
conclusion
to
satisfy
a
natural
feeling
no
one
will
object
because
the
good
fight
terminates
victoriously
in
the
right
direction
the
parents
of
erasmus
suffered
but
it
would
be
a
pity
if
readers
after
the
lapse
of
four
hundred
years
must
mourn
their
woes
to
the
extent
that
would
inevitably
be
necessary
if
reade
had
not
arranged
it
otherwise
and
his
object
which
was
to
prove
if
proof
were
needed
that
all
human
lives
however
obscure
have
their
own
share
of
romance
is
not
disturbed
by
this
variation
from
the
severity
of
the
chronicle
conducted
by
an
association
of
collegiate
and
professional
students

united
states
and

new

we
are
not
unused
to
the
sight
of
college
periodicals
they
have
commonly
greeted
us
in
the
form
of
monthly
numbers
each
containing
two
or
three
essays
which
sounded
as
if
they
might
have
done
duty
as
themes
a
critical
article
or
two
some
copies
of
verses
and
winding
up
with
a
few
pages
in
fine
print
purporting
to
be
editorial
jaunty
and
jocular
for
the
most
part
and
opulent
in
local
allusions
it
would
he
unnatural
if
these
juvenile
productions
did
not
often
reflect
the
opinions
of
favorite
instructors
and
the
style
of
popular
authors
a
freshman

essay
is
like
the
short
gallop
of
a
colt
on
trial
its
promise
is
what
we
care
for
more
than
its
performance
if
it
had
not
something
of
crudeness
and
imitation
we
should
suspect
the
youth
and
be
disposed
to
examine
him
as
the
british
turfmen
have
been
examining
the
american
colt
umpire

favorite
for
the
next
derby
but
three
or
four
years
study
and
practice
teach
the
young
man
his
paces

that
many
bachelors
of
arts
have
formed
the
style
already
by
which
they
will
hereafter
be
known
in
the
world
of
letters
we
are
always
pleased
therefore
to
look
over
a
college
periodical
even
of
the
humblest
pretensions
the
possibilities
of
its
young
writers
give
an
interest
and
dignity
to
the
least
among
them
which
make
its
slender
presence
welcome
but
here
we
have
offered
us
a
more
formidable
candidate
for
public
favor
than
our
old
friends
the
attenuated
monthlies
the
undergraduate
has
almost
the
dimensions
of
the
north
american
review
and
like
that
promises
to
visit
us
quarterly
it
is
the
first
fruit
of
a
spirited
and
apparently
plan
set
on
foot
by
students
in
yale
college
and
heartily
entered
into
by
those
of
several
other
institutions
its
objects
are
clearly
stilted
in
the
prospectus
and
introduction
they
are
briefly
these
to
record
the
history
promote
the
intellectual
improvement
elevate
the
moral
aims
liberalize
the
views
and
unite
the
sympathies
of
academical
collegiate
and
professional
students
and
their
institutions
the
name
undergraduate
shows
by
whom
it
is
to
be
managed
but
its
contributors
are
and
will
doubtless
continue
to
he
in
part
of
a
more
advanced
standing
there
are
articles
in
the
present
number
which
we
have
read
with
great
interest
and
without
ever
being
reminded
that
they
were
contributed
to
a
students
journal
the
first
paper
for
instance
german
and
travel
is
not
only
well
written
but
full
of
excellent
suggestions
which
show
that
the
writer
has
reached
the
age
of
good
sense
whether
he
count
his
years
by
tens
or
scores
a
voyage
to
labrador
is
a
story
of
scenes
and
experiences
new
to
most
readers
not
less
pleased
were
we
to
have
an
authentic
account
of
the
two
ancient
societies
of
yale
college
brothers
in
unity
and
linonia
rivals
for
almost
a
century
and
still
maintaining
their
protracted
struggle
for
numerical
superiority
articles
like
this
will
interest
all
students
and
many
outside
of
the
the
undergraduate
would
not
treat
us
fairly
if
it
did
not
temper
them
somewhat
as
it
has
done
with
specimens
of
more
distinctly
youthful
character
perhaps
it
might
be
safe
to
lay
it
down
as
a
law
that
the
tenderer
the
age
the
wider
the
subject
and
contrariwise
the
older
the
head
the
more
limited
and
definite
the
probable
range
of
discussion
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
young
man
essay
is
most
likely
to
be
interesting
when
he
writes
about
something
he
has
seen
or
experienced
so
as
to
know
more
about
it
than
his
readers
disquisitions
on
virtue
honesty
shakspeare
human
nature
and
such
large
subjects
are
valuable
chiefly
as
showing
how
the
colts
gallop
on
the
whole
the
undergraduate
is
most
creditable
to
the
enterprise
that
gave
it
birth
and
to
the
young
men
who
have
contributed
to
it
if
we
should
give
any
additional
hints
to
that
just
whispered
it
would
be
that
more
care
should
be
taken
in
looking
over
the
proofs
calvinism
should
not
be
spelt
thackeray
nor
courvoisier
neither
should
traveller
be
spelt
nor
theatre
these
last
provincialisms
particularly
should
not
find
a
place
in
a
journal
meant
for
students
all
over
the
world
and
if
as
we
hope
contributions
shall
hereafter
appear
in
the
new
quarterly
from
any
persons
connected
with
our
neighboring
university
it
should
be
a
condition
that
the
english
standard
of
spelling
should
be
adopted
in
preference
to
any
local
perversions
with
these
suggestions
we
give
a
most
cordial
welcome

periodical

we
trust
will
begin
