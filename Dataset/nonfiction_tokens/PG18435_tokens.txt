foreword
that
the
average
parent
is
blind
to
the
faults
of
its
offspring
is
a
fact
so
obvious
that
in
attempting
to
prove
or
controvert
it
time
and
logic
are
both
wasted
ill
temper
in
a
child
is
alas
too
often
mistaken
for
an
indication
of
genius
and
impudence
is
sometimes
regarded
as
a
sign
of
precocity
the
author
however
has
honestly
striven
to
avoid
this
common
prejudice
this
book
the
child
of
his
brain
and
experience
extending
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
varying
environment
he
frankly
admits
is
not
without
its
faults
is
far
from
perfect
but
he
is
satisfied
that
notwithstanding
its
apparent
shortcomings
it
will
serve
in
a
humble
way
some
useful
purpose
the
recipes
given
in
the
following
pages
represent
the
labor
of
years
their
worth
has
been
demonstrated
not
experimentally
but
by
actual
tests
day
by
day
and
month
by
month
under
dissimilar
and
in
many
instances
not
too
favorable
conditions
one
of
the
pleasures
in
life
to
the
normal
man
is
good
eating
and
if
it
be
true
that
real
happiness
consists
in
making
others
happy
the
author
can
at
least
feel
a
sense
of
gratification
in
the
thought
that
his
attempts
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
the
inner
man
have
not
been
wholly
unappreciated
by
the
many
that
he
has
had
the
pleasure
of
serving
some
of
whom
are
now
his
stanchest
friends
in
fact
it
was
in
response
to
the
insistence
and
encouragement
of
these
friends
that
he
embarked
in
the
rather
hazardous
undertaking
of
offering
this
collection
to
a
discriminating
public
to
snatch
from
his
daily
toil
a
few
moments
here
and
there
in
order
to
arrange
with
some
degree
of
symmetry
not
the
delicacies
that
would
awaken
the
jaded
appetite
of
the
gourmet
but
to
prepare
an
ensemble
that
might
with
equal
grace
adorn
the
home
table
or
banquet
board
has
proven
a
task
of
no
mean
proportions
encouraged
by
his
friends
however
he
persevered
and
this
volume
is
the
results
of
his
effort
if
when
gathered
around
the
festal
board
in
camp
or
by
fireside
on
train
or
ship
trying
out
the
recipes
his
friends
will
pause
retrospectively
and
with
kindly
feelings
think
from
whence
some
of
the
good
things
emanated
the
author
will
feel
amply
compensated
for
the
care
the
thought
the
labor
he
has
expended
in
the
preparation
of
the
book
and
to
those
friends
individually
and
collectively
it
is
therefore
dedicated
sketch
of
my
life
i
was
born
in
murray
county
tennessee
in
a
slave
i
was
given
the
name
of
my
master

two

broke
out
all
the

hints
to
kitchen
maids
it
is
always
necessary
to
keep
your
kitchen
in
the
best
condition
if
a
percolator
is
used
it
should
first
be
put
into
operation
if
the
breakfast
consists
of
grapefruit
cereals
your
cereal
should
be
the
next
article
prepared
if
there
is
no
diningroom
maid
you
can
then
put
your
diningroom
in
order
if
hot
bread
is
to
be
served
including
cakes
that
is
the
next
thing
to
be
prepared
your
gas
range
is
of
course
lighted
and
your
oven
heated
perhaps
you
have
for
breakfast
poached
eggs
on
toast
deerfoot
sausage
or
boiled
ham
one
of
the
above
with
your
other
dishes
is
enough
for
a
person
employed
indoors
when
your
breakfast
gong
is
sounded
put
your
biscuits
eggs
bread
in
the
oven
so
that
they
may
be
ready
to
serve
when
the
family
have
eaten
their
grapefruit
and
cereal
this
is
the
easiest
meal
of
the
three
to
prepare
yesterday
dinner
perhaps
consisted
of
roast
turkey
beef
or
lamb
and
there
is
some
meat
left
over
then
pick
out
one
of
my
receipts
calling
for
minced
or
creamed
meats
baked
or
stuffed
potatoes
are
always
nice
or
there
may
be
cold
potatoes
left
over
that
can
be
mashed
made
into
cakes
and
fried
for
a
roast
beef
dinner
serve
vegetable
soup
as
the
first
course
with
a
relish
of
vegetables
in
season
and
horseradish
or
pickle
unless
you
serve
salad
if
quail
or
ducks
are
to
be
served
for
dinner
an
old
indian
dish
wild
rice
is
very
desirable
prepare
this
rice
as
follows
place
in
a
double
boiler
a
cupful
of
milk
or
cream
to
each
cupful
of
rice
and
add
salt
and
pepper
to
taste
it
requires
a
little
longer
to
cook
than
the
ordinary
rice
but
must
not
be
stirred
if
it
becomes
dry
add
a
little
milk
from
time
to
time
do
not
serve
dishes
at
the
same
meal
that
conflict
for
instance
if
you
have
sliced
tomatoes
do
not
serve
tomato
soup
if
however
you
have
potato
soup
it
would
not
be
out
of
place
to
serve
potatoes
with
your
dinner
fish
should
never
be
served
without
a
salad
of
some
kind

of
hours

more
then
serve
while
many
prefer
steak
fairly
well
done
still
the
great
majority
desire
to
have
it
either
rare
or
certainly
not
overdone
for
those
who
wish
a
steak
well
done
completely
through
and
still
not
to
have
the
outside
crisp
to
a
cinder
it
is
necessary
to
cut
the
steak
possibly
as
thin
as
inch
and
then
the
outside
can
have
that
delicious
and
intense
scorching
which
quickly
prevents
the
escape
of
juices
and
also
gives
the
slightly
burned
taste
which
at
its
perfect
condition
is
the
most
delicious
flavor
from
my
own
preference
that
can
be
given
to
a
steak
by
this
i
do
not
mean
a
steak
burned
to
a
cinder
but
slightly
scorched
over
a
very
hot
fire
rare
broiled
for
those
who
are
fond
of
rare
steak
it
can
be
cut
from
one
inch
to
one
and
inches
in
thickness
and
the
outside
thoroughly
and
quickly
broiled
leaving
the
inside
practically
only
partially
cooked
so
that
the
blood
will
follow
the
knife
and
still
the
steak
has
been
heated
completely
through
and
a
thin
crust
on
either
side
has
been
well
cooked
which
has
formed
the
shell
to
retain
the
juices
frying
to
fry
steak
properly
although
some
claim
it
is
not
proper
to
fry
steak
under
any
circumstances
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
butter
oleo
fat
or
grease
piping
hot
for
two
reasons
first
the
steak
sears
over
quickly
and
the
juices
are
thus
retained
within
the
steak
to
better
advantage
than
by
the
slow
process
of
cooking
but
even
more
important
is
the
fact
that
the
incrustation
thus
formed
not
only
holds
the
juices
within
the
steak
but
prevents
the
fat
from
penetrating
and
making
the
steak
greasy
soggy
and
unattractive
as
a
rule
however
we
must
acknowledge
that
broiled
steak
is
in
varying
degrees
largely
superior
to
fried

the
juice

does
not
make
a
firm
jelly
without

this
means
that
it

not
keep

must
be
eaten
soon
after

but
if
a

will
satisfy
it
can
be
made
and
kept

crush

simmer
the
juice
ten
minutes
heat
the
sugar
and
drop
into
the
boiling
juice
in
a
few
minutes
a
soft
jelly
will
form
this
is
an
extremely
pretty
way
of
serving
cranberries
in
individual
molds
wash
a
quart
of
cranberries
and
put
in
a
porcelain
or
granite
saucepan
sprinkle
over
the
top
of
the
berries
two
cupfuls
of
sugar
and
on

of
the
sugar
pour
one
cupful
cold
water
set
over
the
fire
and
cook
slowly
when
the
berries
break
into
a
boil
cover
just
a
few
moments
not
long
or
the
skins
will
burst
then
uncover
and
cook
until
tender
do
not
strain
but
pour
at
once
into
small
china
molds
this
gives
a
dark
rich
looking
mold
that
is
not
too
acid
and
preserves
the
individuality
of
the
fruit
if
you
wish
to
use
some
of
the
cranberries
in
lieu
of
maraschino
cherries
take
up
some
of
the
most
perfect
