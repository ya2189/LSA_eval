care
of
gas
ranges
in
order
to
get
satisfactory
and
economical
service
and
a
long
life
any
range
or
mechanical
device
must
be
kept
clean
this
applies
to
the
gas
range
as
well
and
we
therefore
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
little
attention
required
is
very
much
worth
while
clean
the
top
the
ovens
and
removable
drip
pan
frequently
clean
broiler
griddle
and
pan
time
it
is
used
if
any
burner
holes
become
clogged
clean
them
out
with
a
piece
of
wire
or
a
hairpin
keep
the
air
inlets
on
the
shutter
at
the
front
of
the
burners
near
the
levers
clear
of
dust
the
suction
at
this
point
draws
the
dust
which
if
allowed
to
accumulate
will
cause
the

to
burn
yellow
or
red
instead
of
blue
more
ranges
rust
out
than
wear
out
to
keep
the
range
free
from
rust
rub
it
very
frequently
with
a
cloth
slightly
oiled
with
any
kind
of
oil
or
grease
except
kerosene
or
one
containing
salt
we
suggest
the
use
of
olive
oil
or
one
of
its
cheaper
substitutes
this
is
done
to
the
best
advantage
while
the
range
is
warm
when
the
burners
become
greasy
remove
and
wash
them
thoroughly
in
soap
and
hot
water
never
black
the
burners
or
top
grates
the
broiler
pan
and
rack
should
be
kept
out
of
the
range
when
oven
is
being
used
or
it
will
rust
warp
or
chip
it
requires
the
same
care
any
kitchen
enamel
ware
does
always
leave
oven
and
broiler
doors
open
for
a
few
minutes
after
lighting
the
oven
burners
and
after
extinguishing
them
this
will
dry
the
inside
of
the
range
and
prevent
rusting
use
of
the
range
with
reasonable
care
gas
is
much
cheaper
for
household
cooking
than
any
other
fuel
every
range
should
be
equipped
with
a
top
burner
lighter
which
is
convenient
and
economical
as
it
is
just
as
easy
to
light
a

as
to
leave
it

never
turn
on
the
gas
until
you
are

it
turn
off
the

as
soon
as
you
are
through

turn
down

in
which
eggs
are
to

cooked
and
break
the

into
this
you
will
also
find
that
the
flour
gives
the
eggs
a
better

shells
when
cooking
if
a
piece
of

can
be

water
and
keeping
in
a
cool
place
the
cooler
the
better
to
prevent
boiling
eggs
from
cracking
the
four
following
suggestions
are
given
in
regard
to
boiling
eggs
use
the
one
best
suited
to
the
purpose
when
boiling
eggs
wet
the
shells
thoroughly
in
cold
water
and
they
will
not
crack
to
prevent
eggs
from
bursting
while
boiling
prick
one
end
of
each
of
the
eggs
with
a
needle
before
placing
them
in
the
water
this
makes
an
outlet
for
the
air
and
keeps
the
shells
from
cracking
if
eggs
which
you
are
about
to
boil
are
cracked
add
a
little
vinegar
to
the
water
and
they
can
then
be
boiled
as
satisfactorily
as
undamaged
ones
a
spoonful
of
salt
should
be
added
to
the
water
in
which
slightly
cracked
eggs
are
boiled
the
salt
will
prevent
the
white
of
the
egg
from
coming
out

when
a
broom
becomes
worn
out
instead
of
throwing
it
away
tie
a
piece
of
felt
or
flannel
cloth
around
the
head
and
make
a
good
floor
polisher
it
will
make
work
much
easier
and
also
keep
linoleum
in
good
condition
footmarks
can
be
rubbed
off
at
any
time
without
stooping
to
clean
a
slender

vase
fasten
a
piece
of
an
old
sponge
onto
a
stick
and
push
it
down
into

vase
this
will
also
be
found
useful
for
cleaning
decanters
and
water
bottles
to
keep
bread
fresh
wash
a
potato
wipe
it
dry
and
put
it
in
your
breadpan
it
will
keep
the
bread
fresh
for
several
days
to
freshen
old
lemons
lemons
that
have
become
old
and
dry
can
be
made
fresh
and
juicy
again
by
putting
them
in
a
pan
of
hot
water
and
keeping
the
water
at
an
even
temperature
for
about
two
hours
a
more
effective
dishcloth
for
cleaning
in
knitting
dishcloths
it
is
a
good
plan
to
put
in
several
rows
of
cord
this
hard
part
of
the
cloth
will
clean
many
surfaces
on
which
it
is
not
advisable
to
use
scouring
soap
or
metal
to
clean
linoleum
use
skimmed
milk
instead
of
water
it
will
keep
it
glossy
and
will
not
rot
it
as

does
a
good
remedy
for
burns
cover
a
soft
cloth
with
a
thick
layer
of
scraped
raw
potato
irish
and
apply
it
to
the
burned
part
the
potato
should
be
renewed
as
often
as
necessary
to
keep
it
moist
for
burns
and
light
scalds
at
once
coat
the
burned
or
scalded
spot
with
mucilage
and
the
smarting
will
cease
almost
instantly
if
the
burn
is
quite
deep
keep
it
covered
with
a
paste
made
of
cold
water
and
flour
do
not
allow
the
paste
to

are
so
fine

they
are
more

the
three
following
suggestions
are
made
with
reference
to
cleaning
with
gasoline
to
take
the
odor
of
gasoline
out
of
freshly
cleaned
garments
use
oil
of
sassafras
in
the
gasoline
to
the
proportion
of
about
five
drops
to
a
quart
of
gasoline
if
a
little
salt
is
added
to
gasoline
which
is
used
for
cleaning
wool
or
silk
material
there
will
be
no
ring
remaining
when
dry
put
about
part
of
vinegar
in
the
water
with
which
you
dampen
the
cloth
when
pressing
an
article
that
has
been
cleaned
with
gasoline
this
will
not
only
remove
the
scent
of
the
gasoline
but
will
prevent
circles
forming
alcohol
for
cleaning
white
kid
articles
pure
alcohol
is
better
than
gasoline
for
cleaning
white
kid
gloves
or
other
white

as
it
dries
quickly
without
the
unpleasant
odor
that
gasoline

shoes
before
scrubbing
with
the
lather
if
new

will
not

rub
them
over
with
half
a

and
leave
until
