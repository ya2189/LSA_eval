to
the
matters
presented
to
his
imperial
majesty
by
the
elector
of
saxony
and
some
princes
and
states
of
the
holy
roman
empire
on
the
subject
and
concerning
causes
pertaining
to
the
christian
orthodox
faith
the
following
christian
reply
can
be
august
confutatio
pontificia
august
as
his
worshipful
imperial
majesty
received
several
days
since
a
confession
of
faith
presented
by
the
elector
the
duke
of
saxony
and
several
princes
and
two
cities
to
which
their
names
were
affixed
with
his
characteristic
zeal
for
the
glory
of
god
the
salvation
of
souls
christian
harmony
and
the
public
peace
he
not
only
himself
read
the
confession
but
also
in
order
that
in
a
matter
of
such
moment
he
might
proceed
the
more
thoroughly
and
seasonably
he
referred
the
aforesaid
confession
to
several
learned
mature
approved
and
honorable
men
of
different
nations
for
their
inspection
and
examination
and
earnestly
directed
and
enjoined
them
to
praise
and
approve
what
in
the
confession
was
said
aright
and
in
accord
with
catholic
doctrine
but
on
the
other
hand
to
note
that
wherein
it
differed
from
the
catholic
church
and
together
with
their
reply
to
present
and
explain
their
judgment
on
each
topic
this
commission
was
executed
aright
and
according
to
order
for
those
learned
men
with
all
care
and
diligence
examined
the
aforesaid
confession
and
committed
to
writing
what
they
thought
on
each
topic
and
thus
presented
a
reply
to
his
imperial
majesty
this
reply
his
worshipful
imperial
majesty
as
becomes
a
christian
emperor
most
accurately
read
and
gave
to
the
other
electors
princes
and
estates
of
the
roman
empire
for
their
perusal
and
examination
which
they
also
approved
as
orthodox
and
in
every
respect
harmonious
with
the
gospel
and
holy
scripture
for
this
reason
after
a
conference
with
the
electors
princes
and
states
above
named
in
order
that
all
dissension
concerning
this
our
orthodox
holy
faith
and
religion
may
be
removed
his
imperial
majesty
has
directed
that
a
declaration
be
made
at
present
as
follows
in
reference
to
the
matters
presented
to
his
imperial
majesty
by
the
elector
of
saxony
and
some
princes
and
states
of
the
holy
roman
empire
on
the
subject
and
concerning
causes
pertaining
to
the
christian
orthodox
faith
the
following
christian
reply
can
be
given
part
i
to
article
i
especially
when
in
the
first
article
they
confess
the
unity
of
the
divine
essence
in
three
persons
according
to
the
decree
of
the
council
of
nice
their
confession
must
be
accepted
since
it
agrees
in
all
respects
with
the
rule
of
faith
and
the
roman
church
for
the
council
of
nice
convened
under
the
emperor
constantine
the
great
has
always
been
regarded
inviolable
whereat
three
hundred
and
eighteen
bishops
eminent
and
venerable
for
holiness
of
life
martyrdom
and
learning
after
investigating
and
diligently
examining
the
holy
scriptures
set
forth
this
article
which
they
here
confess
concerning
the
unity
of
the
essence
and
the
trinity
of
persons
so
too
their
condemnation
of
all
heresies
arising
contrary
to
this
article
must
be
accepted
viz
the
manichaeans
arians
eunomians
valentinians
samosatanes
for
the
holy
catholic
church
has
condemned
these
of
old
to
article
ii
in
the
second
article
we
approve
their
confession
in
common
with
the
catholic
church
that
the
fault
of
origin
is
truly
sin
condemning
and
bringing
eternal
death
upon
those
who
are
not
born
again
by
baptism
and
the
holy
ghost
for
in
this
they
properly
condemn
the
pelagians
both
modern
and
ancient
who
have
been
long
since
condemned
by
the
church
but
the
declaration
of
the
article
that
original
sin
is
that
men
are
born
without
the
fear
of
god
and
without
trust
in
god
is
to
be
entirely
rejected
since
it
is
manifest
to
every
christian
that
to
be
without
the
fear
of
god
and
without
trust
in
god
is
rather
the
actual
guilt
of
an
adult
than
the
offence
of
a
infant
which
does
not
possess
as
yet
the
full
use
of
reason
as
the
lord
says
your
children
which
had
no
knowledge
between
good
and
evil
deut
moreover
the
declaration
is
also
rejected
whereby
they
call
the
fault
of
origin
concupiscence
if
they
mean
thereby
that
concupiscence
is
a
sin
that
remains
sin
in
a
child
even
after
baptism
for
the
apostolic
see
has
already
condemned
two
articles
of
martin
luther
concerning
sin
remaining
in
a
child
after
baptism
and
concerning
the
fomes
of
sin
hindering
a
soul
from
entering
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
if
according
to
the
opinion
of
st
augustine
they
call
the
vice
of
origin
concupiscence
which
in
baptism
ceases
to
be
sin
this
ought
to
be
accepted
since
indeed
according
to
the
declaration
of
paul
we
are
all
born
children
of
wrath
eph
and
in
adam
we
all
have
sinned
to
article
iii
in
the
third
article
there
is
nothing
to
offend
since
the
entire
confession
agrees
with
the
apostles
creed
and
the
right
rule
of
faith
viz
the
son
of
god
became
incarnate
assumed
human
nature
into
the
unity
of
his
person
was
born
of
the
virgin
mary
truly
suffered
was
crucified
died
descended
to
hell
rose
again
on
the
third
day
ascended
to
heaven
and
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
to
article
iv
in
the
fourth
article
the
condemnation
of
the
pelagians
who
thought
that
man
can
merit
eternal
life
by
his
own
powers
without
the
grace
of
god
is
accepted
as
catholic
and
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
councils
for
the
holy
scriptures
expressly
testify
to
this
john
the
baptist
says
a
man
can
receive
nothing
except
it
be
given
him
from
heaven
john
every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
comes
down
from
the
father
of
lights
james
therefore
our
sufficiency
is
of
god
cor
and
christ
says
no
man
can
come
to
me
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
him
john
and
paul
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive
i
cor
for
if
any
one
should
intend
to
disapprove
of
the
merits
that
men
acquire
by
the
assistance
of
divine
grace
he
would
agree
with
the
manichaeans
rather
than
with
the
catholic
church
for
it
is
entirely
contrary
to
holy
scripture
to
deny
that
our
works
are
meritorious
for
paul
says
i
have
fought
a
good
fight
i
have
finished
my
course
i
have
kept
the
faith
henceforth
there
is
laid
up
for
me
a
crown
of
righteousness
which
the
lord
the
righteous
judge
shall
give
me
at
that
day
tim
and
to
the
corinthians
he
wrote
we
must
all
appear
before
the
of
christ
that
every
one
may
receive
the
things
done
in
his
body
according
to
that
he
hath
done
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
cor
for
where
there
are
wages
there
is
merit
the
lord
said
to
abraham
fear
not
abraham
i
am
thy
shield
and
thy
exceeding
great
reward
gen
and
isaiah
says
behold
his
reward
is
with
him
and
his
work
before
him
isa
and
chapter
deal
they
bread
to
the
hungry
and
thy
righteousness
shall
go
before
thee
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
go
before
thee
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
gather
thee
up
so
too
the
lord
to
cain
if
thou
doest
well
shalt
thou
not
be
accepted
so
the
parable
in
the
gospel
declares
that
we
have
been
hired
for
the
lord
vineyard
who
agrees
with
us
for
a
penny
a
day
and
says
call
the
laborers
and
give
them
their
hire
matt
so
paul
knowing
the
mysteries
of
god
says
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
labor
i
cor
nevertheless
all
catholics
confess
that
our
works
of
themselves
have
no
merit
but
that
god
grace
makes
them
worthy
of
eternal
life
thus
john
says
they
shall
walk
with
me
in
white
for
they
are
worthy
rev
and
st
paul
says
to
the
colossians
giving
thanks
unto
the
father
which
hath
made
us
meet
to
be
partakers
of
the
inheritance
of
the
saints
in
light
to
article
in
the
fifth
article
the
statement
that
the
holy
ghost
is
given
by
the
word
and
sacraments
as
by
instruments
is
approved
for
thus
it
is
written
acts
while
peter
yet
spoke
these
words
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
word
and
john
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
holy
ghost
the
mention
however
that
they
here
make
of
faith
is
approved
so
far
as
not
faith
alone
which
some
incorrectly
teach
but
faith
which
worketh
by
love
is
understood
as
the
apostle
teaches
aright
in
gal
for
in
baptism
there
is
an
infusion
not
of
faith
alone
but
also
at
the
same
time
of
hope
and
love
as
pope
alexander
declares
in
the
canon
majores
concerning
baptism
and
its
effect
which
john
the
baptist
also
taught
long
before
saying
luke
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
to
article
vi
their
confession
in
the
sixth
article
that
faith
should
bring
forth
good
fruits
is
acceptable
and
valid
since
faith
without
works
is
dead
james
and
all
scripture
invites
us
to
works
for
the
wise
man
says
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
eccles
and
the
lord
had
respect
to
abel
and
to
his
offering
he
saw
that
abraham
would
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
him
to
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
and
to
do
justice
and
judgment
and
by
myself
have
i
sworn
saith
the
lord
for
because
thou
hast
done
this
thing
i
will
bless
thee
and
multiply
thy
seed
gen
thus
he
regarded
the
fast
of
the
ninevites
jonah
and
the
lamentations
and
tears
of
king
hezekiah
kings
for
this
cause
all
the
faithful
should
follow
the
advice
of
paul
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
gal
for
christ
says
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
john
but
in
the
same
article
their
ascription
of
justification
to
faith
alone
is
diametrically
opposite
the
truth
of
the
gospel
by
which
works
are
not
excluded
because
glory
honor
and
peace
to
every
man
that
worketh
good
rom
why
because
david
ps
christ
matt
and
paul
rom
testify
that
god
will
render
to
every
one
according
to
his
works
besides
christ
says
not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
matt
hence
however
much
one
may
believe
if
he
work
not
what
is
good
he
is
not
a
friend
of
god
ye
are
my
friends
says
christ
if
ye
do
whatsoever
i
command
you
john
on
this
account
their
frequent
ascription
of
justification
to
faith
is
not
admitted
since
it
pertains
to
grace
and
love
for
paul
says
though
i
have
all
faith
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
cor
here
paul
certifies
to
the
princes
and
the
entire
church
that
faith
alone
does
not
justify
accordingly
he
teaches
that
love
is
the
chief
virtue
above
all
these
things
put
on
charity
which
is
the
bond
of
perfectness
neither
are
they
supported
by
the
word
of
christ
when
ye
shall
have
done
all
these
things
say
we
are
unprofitable
servants
luke
for
if
the
doors
ought
to
be
called
unprofitable
how
much
more
fitting
is
it
to
say
to
those
who
only
believe
when
ye
shall
have
believed
all
things
say
we
are
unprofitable
servants
this
word
of
christ
therefore
does
not
extol
faith
without
works
but
teaches
that
our
works
bring
no
profit
to
god
that
no
one
can
be
puffed
up
by
our
works
that
when
contrasted
with
the
divine
reward
our
works
are
of
no
account
and
nothing
thus
paul
says
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
to
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
us
rom
for
faith
and
good
works
are
gifts
of
god
whereby
through
mercy
eternal
life
is
given
so
too
the
citation
at
this
point
from
ambrose
is
in
no
way
pertinent
since
ambrose
is
here
expressed
declaring
his
opinion
concerning
legal
works
for
he
says
without
the
law
but
without
the
law
of
the
sabbath
and
of
circumcision
and
of
revenge
and
this
he
declares
the
more
clearly
on
rom
citing
james
concerning
the
justification
of
abraham
without
legal
works
before
circumcision
for
how
could
ambrose
speak
differently
in
his
comments
from
paul
in
the
text
when
he
says
therefore
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
in
his
sight
therefore
finally
he
does
not
exclude
faith
absolutely
but
says
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
to
article
vii
the
seventh
article
of
the
confession
wherein
it
is
affirmed
that
the
church
is
the
congregation
of
saints
can
not
be
admitted
without
prejudice
to
faith
if
by
this
definition
the
wicked
and
sinners
be
separated
from
the
church
for
in
the
council
of
constance
this
article
was
condemned
among
the
articles
of
john
huss
of
cursed
memory
and
it
plainly
contradicts
the
gospel
for
there
we
read
that
john
the
baptist
compared
the
church
to
a
which
christ
will
cleanse
with
his
fan
and
will
gather
the
wheat
into
his
garner
but
will
burn
the
chaff
with
unquenchable
fire
matt
wherefore
this
article
of
the
confession
is
in
no
way
accepted
although
we
read
in
it
their
confession
that
the
church
is
perpetual
since
here
the
promise
of
christ
has
its
place
who
promises
that
the
spirit
of
truth
will
abide
with
it
forever
john
and
christ
himself
promises
that
he
will
be
with
the
church
alway
unto
the
end
of
the
world
they
are
praised
also
in
that
they
do
not
regard
variety
of
rites
as
separating
unity
of
faith
if
they
speak
of
special
rites
for
to
this
effect
jerome
says
every
province
abounds
in
its
own
sense
of
propriety
but
if
they
extend
this
part
of
the
confession
to
universal
church
rites
tis
also
must
be
utterly
rejected
and
we
must
say
with
paul
we
have
no
such
custom
cor
for
by
all
believers
universal
rites
must
be
observed
augustine
whose
testimony
they
also
use
well
taught
of
januarius
for
we
must
presume
that
such
rites
were
transmitted
from
the
apostles
to
article
viii
the
eighth
article
of
the
confession
concerning
wicked
ministers
of
the
church
and
hypocrites
viz
that
their
wickedness
does
not
injure
the
sacraments
and
the
word
is
accepted
with
the
holy
roman
church
and
the
princes
commend
it
condemning
on
this
topic
the
donatists
and
the
ancient
origenists
who
maintained
that
it
was
unlawful
to
use
the
ministry
of
the
wicked
in
the
church
a
heresy
which
the
waldenses
and
poor
of
lyons
revived
afterwards
john
wicliff
in
england
and
john
huss
in
bohemia
adopted
this
to
article
ix
the
ninth
article
concerning
baptism
viz
that
it
is
necessary
to
salvation
and
that
children
ought
to
be
baptized
is
approved
and
accepted
and
they
are
right
in
condemning
the
anabaptists
a
most
seditious
class
of
men
that
ought
to
be
banished
far
from
the
boundaries
of
the
roman
empire
in
order
that
illustrious
germany
may
not
suffer
again
such
a
destructive
and
sanguinary
commotion
as
she
experienced
five
tears
ago
in
the
slaughter
of
so
many
thousands
to
article
x
the
tenth
article
gives
no
offense
in
its
words
because
they
confess
that
in
the
eucharist
after
the
consecration
lawfully
made
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
are
substantially
and
truly
present
if
only
they
believe
that
the
entire
christ
is
present
under
each
form
so
that
the
blood
of
christ
is
no
less
present
under
the
form
of
bread
by
concomitance
than
it
is
under
the
form
of
the
wine
and
the
reverse
otherwise
in
the
eucharist
the
body
of
christ
is
dead
and
bloodless
contrary
to
paul
because
christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
more
rom
one
matter
is
added
as
very
necessary
to
the
article
of
the
confession
viz
that
they
believe
the
church
rather
than
some
teaching
otherwise
and
incorrectly
that
by
the
almighty
word
of
god
in
the
consecration
of
the
eucharist
the
substance
of
the
bread
is
changed
into
the
body
of
christ
for
thus
in
a
general
council
it
has
been
determined
canon
firmiter
concerning
the
exalted
trinity
and
the
catholic
faith
they
are
praised
therefor
for
condemning
the
capernaites
who
deny
the
truth
of
the
body
and
blood
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
the
eucharist
to
article
xi
the
eleventh
article
their
acknowledgment
that
private
absolution
with
confession
should
be
retained
in
the
church
is
accepted
as
catholic
and
in
harmony
with
our
faith
because
absolution
is
supported
by
the
word
of
christ
for
christ
says
to
his
apostles
john
whosoever
sins
ye
remit
they
are
remitted
unto
them
nevertheless
two
things
must
here
be
required
of
them
one
that
they
compel
an
annual
confession
to
be
observed
by
their
subjects
according
to
the
constitution
canon
omnis
utriusque
concerning
penance
and
remission
and
the
custom
of
the
church
universal
another
that
through
their
preachers
they
cause
their
subjects
to
be
faithfully
admonished
when
they
are
about
to
confess
that
although
they
can
not
state
all
their
sins
individually
nevertheless
a
diligent
examination
of
their
conscience
being
made
they
make
an
entire
confession
of
their
offences
viz
of
all
which
occur
to
their
memory
in
such
investigation
but
in
regard
to
the
rest
that
have
been
forgotten
and
have
escaped
our
mind
it
is
lawful
to
make
a
general
confession
and
to
say
with
the
psalmist
ps
cleanse
me
lord
from
secret
faults
to
article
xii
in
the
twelfth
article
their
confession
that
such
as
have
fallen
may
find
remission
of
sins
at
the
time
when
they
are
converted
and
that
the
church
should
give
absolution
unto
such
as
return
to
repentance
is
commended
since
they
most
justly
condemn
the
novatians
who
deny
that
repentance
can
be
repeated
in
opposition
both
to
the
prophet
who
promises
grace
to
the
sinner
at
whatever
hour
he
shall
mourn
ezek
and
the
merciful
declaration
of
christ
our
saviour
replying
to
peter
that
not
until
seven
times
but
until
seventy
times
seven
in
one
day
he
should
forgive
his
brother
sinning
against
him
matt
but
the
second
part
of
this
article
is
utterly
rejected
for
when
they
ascribe
only
two
parts
to
repentance
they
antagonize
the
entire
church
which
from
the
time
of
the
apostles
has
held
and
believed
that
there
are
three
parts
of
repentance
contrition
confession
and
satisfaction
thus
the
ancient
doctors
origen
cyprian
chrysostom
gregory
augustine
taught
in
attestation
of
the
holy
scriptures
especially
from
kings
concerning
david
chron
concerning
manasseh
ps
etc
therefore
pope
leo
x
of
happy
memory
justly
condemned
this
article
of
luther
who
taught
that
there
are
three
parts
of
repentance
viz
confession
contrition
and
satisfaction
has
no
foundation
in
scripture
or
in
holy
christian
doctors
this
part
of
the
article
therefore
can
in
no
way
be
admitted
so
too
neither
can
that
which
asserts
that
faith
is
the
second
part
of
repentance
since
it
is
known
to
all
that
faith
precedes
repentance
for
unless
one
believes
he
will
not
repent
neither
is
that
part
admitted
which
makes
light
of
pontifical
satisfactions
for
it
is
contrary
to
the
gospel
contrary
to
the
apostles
contrary
to
the
fathers
contrary
to
the
councils
and
contrary
to
the
universal
catholic
church
john
the
baptist
cries
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
matt
paul
teaches
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
uncleanness
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
holiness
rom
he
likewise
preached
to
the
gentiles
that
they
should
repent
and
be
converted
to
god
bringing
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
acts
so
christ
himself
also
began
to
teach
and
preach
repentance
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
matt
afterward
he
commanded
the
apostles
to
pursue
this
mode
of
preaching
and
teaching
luke
and
peter
faithfully
obeyed
him
in
his
first
sermon
acts
so
augustine
also
exhorts
that
every
one
exercise
toward
himself
severity
so
that
being
judged
of
himself
he
shall
not
be
judged
of
the
lord
as
paul
says
cor
pope
leo
surnamed
the
great
said
the
mediator
between
god
and
men
the
man
christ
jesus
gave
to
those
set
over
the
churches
the
authority
to
assign
to
those
who
confess
the
doing
of
penance
and
through
the
door
of
reconciliation
to
admit
to
the
communion
of
the
sacraments
those
who
have
been
cleansed
by
a
salutary
satisfaction
brose
says
the
amount
of
the
penance
must
be
adapted
to
the
trouble
of
the
conscience
hence
divere
penitential
canons
were
appointed
in
the
holy
synod
of
nice
in
accordance
with
the
diversity
of
satisfactions
jovinian
the
heretic
thought
however
that
all
sins
are
equal
and
accordingly
did
not
admit
a
diversity
of
satisfactions
moreover
satisfactions
should
not
be
abolished
in
the
church
contrary
to
the
express
gospel
and
the
decrees
of
councils
and
fathers
but
those
absolved
by
the
priest
ought
to
perform
the
penance
enjoined
following
the
declaration
of
paul
he
gave
himself
for
us
to
redeem
us
from
all
iniquity
and
purify
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people
zealous
of
good
works
tit
christ
thus
made
satisfaction
for
us
that
we
might
be
zealous
of
good
works
fulfilling
the
satisfaction
enjoined
to
article
xiii
the
thirteenth
article
gives
no
offence
but
is
accepted
while
they
say
that
the
sacraments
were
instituted
not
only
to
be
marks
of
profession
among
men
but
rather
to
be
signs
and
testimonies
of
god
will
toward
us
nevertheless
we
must
request
them
that
what
they
here
ascribe
to
the
sacraments
in
general
they
confess
also
specifically
concerning
the
seven
sacraments
of
the
church
and
take
measures
for
the
observance
of
them
by
their
subjects
to
article
xiv
when
in
the
fourteenth
article
they
confess
that
no
one
ought
to
administer
in
the
church
the
word
of
god
and
the
sacraments
unless
he
be
rightly
called
it
ought
to
be
understood
that
he
is
rightly
called
who
is
called
in
accordance
with
the
form
of
law
and
the
ecclesiastical
ordinances
and
decrees
hitherto
observed
everywhere
in
the
christian
world
and
not
according
to
a
jeroboitic
cf
kings
call
or
a
tumult
or
any
other
irregular
intrusion
of
the
people
aaron
was
not
thus
called
therefore
in
this
sense
the
confession
is
received
nevertheless
they
should
be
admonished
to
persevere
therein
and
to
admit
in
their
realms
no
one
either
as
pastor
or
as
preacher
unless
he
be
rightly
called
to
article
xv
in
the
fifteenth
article
their
confession
that
such
ecclesiastical
rites
are
to
be
observed
as
may
be
observed
without
sin
and
are
profitable
for
tranquility
and
good
order
in
the
church
is
accepted
and
they
must
be
admonished
that
the
princes
and
cities
see
to
it
that
the
ecclesiastical
rites
of
the
church
universal
be
observed
in
their
dominions
and
districts
as
well
as
those
which
have
been
kept
devoutly
and
religiously
in
every
province
even
to
us
and
if
any
of
these
have
been
intermitted
that
they
restore
them
and
arrange
determine
and
effectually
enjoin
upon
their
subjects
that
all
things
be
done
in
their
churches
according
to
the
ancient
form
nevertheless
the
appendix
to
this
article
must
be
entirely
removed
since
it
is
false
that
human
ordinances
instituted
to
propitiate
god
and
make
satisfactions
for
sins
are
opposed
to
the
gospel
as
will
be
more
amply
declared
hereafter
concerning
vows
the
choice
of
food
and
the
like
to
article
xvi
the
sixteenth
article
concerning
civil
magistrates
is
received
with
pleasure
as
in
harmony
not
only
with
civil
law
but
also
with
canonical
law
the
gospel
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
universal
norm
of
faith
since
the
apostle
enjoins
that
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
they
that
resist
shall
receive
to
themselves
damnation
rom
and
the
princes
are
praised
for
condemning
the
anabaptists
who
overthrow
all
civil
ordinances
and
prohibit
christians
the
use
of
the
magistracy
and
other
civil
offices
without
which
no
state
is
successfully
administered
to
article
xvii
the
confession
of
the
seventeenth
article
is
received
since
from
the
apostles
creed
and
the
holy
scripture
the
entire
catholic
church
knows
that
christ
will
come
at
the
last
day
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
therefore
they
justly
condemn
here
the
anabaptists
who
think
there
will
be
an
end
of
punishments
to
condemned
men
and
devils
and
imagine
certain
jewish
kingdoms
of
the
godly
before
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
in
this
present
world
the
wicked
being
everywhere
suppressed
to
article
xviii
in
the
eighteenth
article
they
confess
the
power
of
the
free
will
viz
that
it
has
the
power
to
work
a
civil
righteousness
but
that
it
has
not
without
the
holy
ghost
the
virtue
to
work
the
righteousness
of
god
this
confession
is
received
and
approved
for
it
thus
becomes
catholics
to
pursue
the
middle
way
so
as
not
with
the
pelagians
to
ascribe
too
much
to
the
free
will
nor
with
the
godless
manichaeans
to
deny
it
all
liberty
for
both
are
not
without
fault
thus
augustine
says
with
sure
faith
we
believe
and
without
doubt
we
preach
that
a
free
will
exists
in
men
for
it
is
an
inhuman
error
to
deny
the
free
will
in
man
which
every
one
experiences
in
himself
and
is
so
often
asserted
in
the
holy
scriptures
paul
says
having
power
over
his
own
will
cor
of
the
righteous
the
wise
man
says
who
might
offend
and
hath
not
offended
or
done
evil
and
hath
not
done
it
eccles
god
said
to
cain
if
thou
doest
well
shalt
thou
not
be
accepted
and
if
thou
doest
not
well
sin
lieth
at
the
door
and
unto
thee
shall
be
his
desire
and
thou
shalt
rule
over
him
through
the
prophet
isaiah
he
says
if
ye
be
willing
and
obedient
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
but
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel
ye
shall
be
devoured
with
the
sword
this
also
jeremiah
has
briefly
expressed
behold
thou
hast
spoken
and
done
evil
as
thou
couldest
jer
we
add
also
ezek
cast
away
from
you
all
your
transgressions
whereby
ye
have
transgressed
and
make
ye
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
for
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
him
that
dieth
saith
the
lord
god
wherefore
turn
yourselves
and
live
also
paul
the
spirits
of
the
prophets
are
subject
to
the
prophets
cor
likewise
cor
every
man
according
as
he
purposeth
in
his
heart
not
grudgingly
or
of
necessity
finally
christ
overthrew
all
the
manichaeans
with
one
word
when
he
said
ye
have
the
poor
with
you
always
and
whensoever
ye
will
ye
may
do
them
good
mark
and
to
jerusalem
christ
says
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
even
as
a
hen
gathered
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
matt
to
article
xix
the
nineteenth
article
is
likewise
approved
and
accepted
for
god
the
supremely
good
is
not
the
author
of
evils
but
the
rational
and
defectible
will
is
the
cause
of
sin
wherefore
let
no
one
impute
his
midsdeeds
and
crimes
to
god
but
to
himself
according
to
jer
thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee
and
hos
o
israel
thou
hast
destroyed
thyself
but
in
me
is
thy
help
and
david
in
the
spirit
acknowledged
that
god
is
not
one
that
hath
pleasure
in
wickedness
ps
to
article
xx
in
the
twentieth
article
which
does
not
contain
so
much
the
confession
of
the
princes
and
cities
as
the
defense
of
the
preachers
there
is
only
one
thing
that
pertains
to
the
princes
and
cities
viz
concerning
good
works
that
they
do
not
merit
the
remission
of
sins
which
as
it
has
been
rejected
and
disapproved
before
is
also
rejected
and
disapproved
now
for
the
passage
in
daniel
is
very
familiar
redeem
thy
sins
with
alms
dan
and
the
address
of
tobit
to
his
son
alms
do
deliver
from
death
and
suffereth
not
to
come
into
darkness
tobit
and
that
of
christ
give
alms
of
such
things
as
ye
have
and
behold
all
things
are
clean
unto
you
luke
if
works
were
not
meritorious
why
would
the
wise
man
say
god
will
render
a
reward
of
the
labors
of
his
saints
wisd
why
would
peter
so
earnestly
exhort
to
good
works
saying
wherefore
the
rather
brethren
give
diligence
by
good
works
to
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
pet
why
would
paul
have
said
god
is
not
unrighteous
to
forget
your
work
and
labor
of
love
which
ye
have
showed
towards
his
name
heb
nor
by
this
do
we
reject
christ
merit
but
we
know
that
our
works
are
nothing
and
of
no
merit
unless
by
virtue
of
christ
passion
we
know
that
christ
is
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
john
but
christ
as
the
good
shepherd
who
began
to
do
and
teach
acts
has
given
us
an
example
that
as
he
has
done
we
also
should
do
john
he
also
went
through
the
desert
by
the
way
of
good
works
which
all
christians
ought
to
pursue
and
according
to
his
command
bear
the
cross
and
follow
him
matt
he
who
bears
not
the
cross
neither
is
nor
can
be
christ
disciple
that
also
is
true
which
john
says
he
that
saith
he
abideth
in
him
ought
himself
also
so
to
walk
even
as
he
walked
john
moreover
this
opinion
concerning
good
works
was
condemned
and
rejected
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
in
the
time
of
augustine
to
article
xxi
in
the
last
place
they
present
the
article
wherein
they
admit
that
the
memory
of
saints
may
be
set
before
us
that
we
may
follow
their
faith
and
good
works
but
not
that
they
be
invoked
and
aid
be
sought
of
them
it
is
certainly
wonderful
that
the
princes
especially
and
the
cities
have
allowed
this
error
to
be
agitated
in
their
dominions
which
has
been
condemned
so
often
before
in
the
church
since
eleven
hundred
years
ago
jerome
vanquished
in
this
area
the
heretic
vigilantius
long
after
him
arose
the
albigenses
the
poor
men
of
lyons
the
picards
the
cathari
old
and
new
all
of
whom
were
condemned
legitimately
long
ago
wherefore
this
article
of
the
confession
so
frequently
condemned
must
be
utterly
rejected
and
in
harmony
with
the
entire
universal
church
be
condemned
for
in
favor
of
the
invocation
of
saints
we
have
not
only
the
authority
of
the
church
universal
but
also
the
agreement
of
the
holy
fathers
augustine
bernard
jerome
cyprian
chrysostom
basil
and
this
class
of
other
church
teachers
neither
is
the
authority
of
holy
scripture
absent
from
this
catholic
assertion
for
christ
taught
that
the
saints
should
be
honored
if
any
man
serve
me
him
will
my
father
honor
john
if
therefore
god
honors
saints
why
do
not
we
insignificant
men
honor
them
besides
the
lord
was
turned
to
repentance
by
job
when
he
prayed
for
his
friends
job
why
therefore
would
not
god
the
most
pious
who
gave
assent
to
job
do
the
same
to
the
blessed
virgin
when
she
intercedes
we
read
also
in
baruch
o
lord
almighty
thou
god
of
israel
hear
now
the
prayers
of
the
dead
israelites
therefore
the
dead
also
pray
for
us
thus
did
onias
and
jeremiah
in
the
old
testament
for
onias
the
high
priest
was
seen
by
judas
maccabaeus
holding
up
his
hands
and
praying
for
the
whole
body
of
the
jews
afterwards
another
man
appeared
remarkable
both
for
his
age
and
majesty
and
of
great
beauty
about
him
concerning
whom
onias
replied
this
is
a
love
of
the
brethren
and
of
the
people
israel
who
prayeth
much
for
the
people
and
for
the
holy
city
to
wit
jeremiah
the
prophet
macc
besides
we
know
from
the
holy
scriptures
that
the
angels
pray
for
us
why
then
would
we
deny
this
of
the
saints
o
lord
of
hosts
said
the
angels
how
long
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
on
jerusalem
and
on
the
cities
of
judah
against
which
thou
hast
had
indignation
and
the
lord
answered
the
angel
that
talked
with
me
comfortable
words
zech
job
likewise
testifies
if
there
be
an
angel
with
him
speaking
one
among
a
thousand
to
show
unto
man
his
uprightness
he
will
pity
him
and
say
deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
pit
job
this
is
clear
besides
from
the
words
of
that
holy
soul
john
the
evangelist
when
he
says
the
four
beasts
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
each
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odors
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints
rev
and
afterwards
an
angel
stood
at
the
altar
having
a
golden
censer
and
there
was
given
unto
him
much
incense
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
al
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
throne
and
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
came
up
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints
ascended
up
before
god
out
of
the
angel
hand
lastly
cyprian
the
martyr
more
than
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
wrote
to
pope
cornelius
book
i
letter
asking
that
if
any
depart
first
his
prayer
for
our
brethren
and
sisters
may
not
cease
for
if
this
holy
man
had
not
ascertained
that
after
this
life
the
saints
pray
for
the
living
he
would
have
given
exhortation
to
no
purpose
neither
is
their
confession
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
there
is
one
mediator
between
god
and
men
tim
john
for
although
his
imperial
majesty
with
the
entire
church
confesses
that
there
is
one
mediator
of
redemption
nevertheless
the
mediators
of
intercession
are
many
thus
moses
was
both
mediator
and
agent
between
god
and
men
deut
for
he
prayed
for
the
children
of
israel
ex
thus
paul
prayed
for
those
with
whom
he
was
sailing
acts
so
too
he
asked
that
he
be
prayed
for
by
the
romans
rom
by
the
corinthians
cor
and
by
the
colossians
so
while
peter
was
kept
in
prison
prayer
was
made
without
ceasing
of
the
church
unto
god
for
him
acts
christ
therefore
is
our
chief
advocate
and
indeed
the
greatest
but
since
the
saints
are
members
of
christ
cor
and
eph
and
conform
their
will
to
that
of
christ
and
see
that
their
head
christ
prays
for
us
who
can
doubt
that
the
saints
do
the
very
same
thing
which
they
see
christ
doing
with
all
these
things
carefully
considered
we
must
ask
the
princes
and
the
cities
adhering
to
them
that
they
reject
this
part
of
the
confession
and
agree
with
the
holy
universal
and
orthodox
church
and
believe
and
confess
concerning
the
worship
and
intercession
of
saints
what
the
entire
christian
world
believes
and
confesses
and
was
observed
in
all
the
churches
in
the
time
of
augustine
a
christian
people
he
says
celebrates
the
memories
of
martyrs
with
religious
observance
that
it
share
in
their
merits
and
be
aided
by
their
prayers
part
ii
reply
to
the
second
part
of
the
confession
of
lay
communion
under
one
form
as
in
the
confessions
of
the
princes
and
cities
they
enumerate
among
the
abuses
that
laymen
commune
only
under
one
form
and
as
therefore
in
their
dominions
both
forms
are
administered
to
laymen
we
must
reply
according
to
the
custom
of
the
holy
church
that
this
is
incorrectly
enumerated
among
the
abuses
but
that
according
to
the
sanctions
and
statutes
of
the
same
church
it
is
rather
an
abuse
and
disobedience
to
administer
to
laymen
both
forms
for
under
the
one
form
of
bread
the
saints
communed
in
the
primitive
church
of
whom
luke
says
they
continued
steadfastly
in
the
apostles
doctrine
and
fellowship
and
in
breaking
of
bread
acts
here
luke
mentions
bread
alone
likewise
acts
says
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
bread
yea
christ
the
institutor
of
this
most
holy
sacrament
rising
again
from
the
dead
administered
the
eucharist
only
under
one
form
to
the
disciples
going
to
emmaus
where
he
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
and
gave
to
them
and
they
recognized
him
in
the
breaking
of
bread
luke
where
indeed
augustine
chrysostome
theophylact
and
bede
some
of
whom
many
ags
ago
and
not
long
after
the
times
of
the
apostles
affirm
that
it
was
the
eucharist
christ
also
john
very
frequently
mentions
bread
alone
ignatius
a
disciple
of
john
the
evangelist
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
mentions
the
bread
alone
in
the
communion
of
the
eucharist
ambrose
does
likewise
in
his
books
concerning
the
sacraments
speaking
of
the
communion
of
laymen
in
the
council
of
rheims
laymen
were
forbidden
from
bearing
the
sacrament
of
the
body
to
the
sick
and
no
mention
is
there
made
of
the
form
of
wine
hence
it
is
understood
that
the
viaticum
was
given
the
sick
under
only
one
form
the
ancient
penitential
canons
approve
of
this
for
the
council
of
agde
put
a
guilty
priest
into
a
monastery
and
granted
him
only
lay
communion
in
the
council
of
sardica
hosius
prohibits
certain
indiscreet
persons
from
receiving
even
lay
communion
unless
they
finally
repent
there
has
always
been
a
distinction
in
the
church
between
lay
communion
under
one
form
and
priestly
communion
under
both
forms
this
was
beautifully
predicted
in
the
old
testament
concerning
the
descendants
of
eli
it
shall
come
to
pass
says
god
kings
sam
that
everyone
that
is
left
in
thine
house
shall
come
and
crouch
to
him
for
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
morsel
of
bread
and
shall
say
me
i
pray
thee
into
one
of
the
priests
office
vulgate
reads
ad
unam
partem
sacerdotalem
i
may
eat
a
piece
of
bread
here
holy
scripture
clearly
shows
that
the
posterity
of
eli
when
removed
from
the
office
of
the
priesthood
will
seek
to
be
admitted
to
one
sacerdotal
part
to
a
piece
of
bread
so
our
laymen
also
ought
therefore
to
be
content
with
one
sacerdotal
part
the
one
form
for
both
the
roman
pontiffs
and
cardinals
and
all
bishops
and
priests
save
in
the
mass
and
in
the
extreme
hour
of
life
for
a
viaticum
as
it
is
called
in
the
council
of
nice
re
content
with
taking
one
form
which
they
would
not
do
if
they
thought
that
both
forms
would
be
necessary
for
salvation
although
however
both
forms
were
of
old
administered
in
many
churches
to
laymen
for
then
it
was
free
to
commune
under
one
or
under
both
forms
yet
on
account
of
many
dangers
the
custom
of
administering
both
forms
has
ceased
for
when
the
multitude
of
the
people
is
considered
where
there
are
old
and
young
tremulous
and
weak
and
inept
if
great
care
be
not
employed
and
injury
is
done
the
sacrament
by
the
spilling
of
the
liquid
because
of
the
great
multitude
there
would
be
difficulty
also
in
giving
the
chalice
cautiously
for
the
form
of
wine
which
also
when
kept
for
a
long
time
would
sour
and
cause
nausea
or
vomition
to
those
who
would
receive
it
neither
could
it
be
readily
taken
to
the
sick
without
danger
of
spilling
for
these
reasons
and
others
the
churches
in
which
the
custom
had
been
to
give
both
forms
to
laymen
were
induced
undoubtedly
by
impulse
of
the
holy
ghost
to
give
thereafter
but
one
form
from
the
consideration
chiefly
that
the
entire
christ
is
under
each
form
and
is
received
no
less
under
one
form
than
under
two
in
the
council
of
constance
of
such
honorable
renown
a
decree
to
this
effect
appeared
and
so
too
the
synod
of
basle
legitimately
decreed
and
although
it
was
formerly
a
matter
of
freedom
to
use
either
one
or
both
forms
in
the
eucharist
nevertheless
when
the
heresy
arose
which
taught
that
both
forms
were
necessary
the
holy
church
which
is
directed
by
the
holy
ghost
forbade
both
forms
to
laymen
for
thus
the
church
is
sometimes
wont
to
extinguish
heresies
by
contrary
institutions
as
when
some
arose
who
maintained
that
the
eucharist
is
properly
celebrated
only
when
unleavened
bread
is
used
the
church
for
a
while
commanded
that
it
be
administered
with
leavened
bread
and
when
nestorius
wished
to
establish
that
the
perpetual
virgin
mary
was
mother
only
of
christ
not
of
god
the
church
for
a
time
forbade
her
to
be
called
christotokos
mother
of
christ
wherefore
we
must
entreat
the
princes
and
cities
not
to
permit
this
schism
to
be
introduced
into
germany
into
the
roman
empire
or
themselves
to
be
separated
from
the
custom
of
the
church
universal
neither
do
the
arguments
adduced
in
this
article
avail
for
while
christ
indeed
instituted
both
forms
of
the
sacrament
yet
it
is
nowhere
found
in
the
gospel
that
he
enjoined
that
both
forms
be
received
by
the
laity
for
what
is
said
in
matt
drink
ye
all
of
it
was
said
to
the
twelve
apostles
who
were
priests
as
is
manifest
from
mark
where
it
is
said
and
they
all
drank
of
it
this
certainly
was
not
fulfilled
hitherto
with
respect
to
laymen
whence
the
custom
never
existed
throughout
the
entire
church
that
both
forms
were
given
to
laymen
although
it
existed
perhaps
among
the
corinthians
and
carthaginians
and
some
other
churches
as
to
their
reference
to
gelasius
canon
comperimus
of
consecration
dist
if
they
examine
the
document
they
will
find
that
gelasius
speaks
of
priests
and
not
of
laymen
hence
their
declaration
that
the
custom
of
administering
but
one
form
is
contrary
to
divine
law
must
be
rejected
but
most
of
all
the
appendix
to
the
article
must
be
rejected
that
the
procession
with
the
eucharist
must
be
neglected
or
omitted
because
the
sacrament
is
thus
divided
for
they
themselves
know
or
at
least
ought
to
know
that
by
the
christian
faith
christ
has
not
been
divided
but
that
the
entire
christ
is
under
both
forms
and
that
the
gospel
nowhere
forbids
the
division
of
the
sacramental
forms
as
is
done
on
parasceve
holy
or
maundy
thursday
by
the
entire
church
of
the
catholics
although
the
consecration
is
made
by
the
celebrant
in
both
forms
who
also
ought
to
receive
both
therefore
the
princes
and
cities
should
be
admonished
to
pay
customary
reverence
and
due
honor
to
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
our
savior
and
glorifier
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
since
they
believe
and
acknowledge
that
he
is
truly
present
a
matter
which
they
know
has
been
most
religiously
observed
by
their
ancestors
most
christian
princes
ii
of
the
marriage
of
priests
their
enumeration
among
abuses
in
the
second
place
of
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
and
the
manner
in
which
their
priests
marry
and
persuade
others
to
marry
are
verily
matters
worthy
of
astonishment
since
they
call
sacerdotal
celibacy
an
abuse
when
that
which
is
directly
contrary
the
violation
of
celibacy
and
the
illicit
transition
to
marriage
deserves
to
be
called
the
worst
abuse
in
priests
for
that
priests
ought
never
to
marry
aurelius
testifys
in
the
second
council
of
carthage
where
he
says
because
the
apostles
taught
thus
by
example
and
antiquity
itself
has
preserved
it
let
us
also
maintain
it
and
a
little
before
a
canon
to
this
effect
is
read
resolved
that
the
bishops
presbyters
and
deacons
or
those
who
administer
the
sacraments
abstain
as
guardians
of
chastity
from
wives
from
these
words
it
is
clear
that
this
tradition
has
been
received
from
the
apostles
and
not
recently
devised
by
the
church
augustine
following
aurelius
in
the
last
question
concerning
the
old
and
new
testaments
writes
upon
these
words
and
asks
if
perhaps
it
be
said
if
it
is
lawful
and
good
to
marry
why
are
not
priests
permitted
to
have
wives
pope
caliztus
a
holy
man
and
a
martyr
decided
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
that
priest
should
not
marry
the
like
is
read
also
in
the
holy
councils
of
caesarea
neocaesarea
africa
agde
gironne
meaux
and
orleans
thus
the
custom
has
been
observed
from
the
time
of
the
gospel
and
the
apostles
that
one
who
has
been
put
into
the
office
of
priests
has
never
been
permitted
according
to
law
to
marry
it
is
indeed
true
that
on
account
of
lack
of
ministers
of
god
in
the
primitive
church
married
men
were
admitted
to
the
priesthood
as
is
clear
from
the
apostolic
canons
and
the
reply
of
paphnutius
in
the
council
of
nice
nevertheless
those
who
wished
to
contract
marriage
were
compelled
to
do
so
before
receiving
the
subdiaconate
as
we
read
in
the
canon
si
quis
corum
dist
this
custom
of
the
primitive
church
the
greek
church
has
preserved
and
retained
to
this
day
but
when
by
the
grace
of
god
the
church
has
increased
so
that
there
was
no
lack
of
ministers
in
the
church
pope
siricius
eleven
hundred
and
forty
years
ago
undoubtedly
not
without
the
holy
ghost
enjoined
absolute
continence
upon
the
priests
canon
plurimus
dist
an
injunction
which
popes
innocent
leo
the
great
and
gregory
the
great
approved
and
ratified
and
which
the
latin
church
has
everywhere
observed
to
this
day
from
these
facts
it
is
regarded
sufficiently
clear
that
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
is
not
an
abuse
and
that
it
was
approved
by
fathers
so
holy
at
such
a
remote
time
and
was
received
by
the
entire
latin
church
besides
the
priests
of
the
old
law
as
in
the
case
of
zacharias
were
separated
from
their
wives
at
times
when
they
discharged
their
office
and
ministered
in
the
temple
but
since
the
priest
of
the
new
law
ought
always
to
be
engaged
in
the
ministry
it
follows
that
he
ought
always
to
be
continent
furthermore
married
persons
should
not
defraud
one
the
other
of
conjugal
duties
except
for
a
time
that
they
may
give
themselves
to
prayer
cor
but
since
a
priest
ought
always
to
pray
he
ought
always
to
be
continent
besides
paul
says
but
i
would
have
you
without
carefulness
he
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
lord
that
he
may
please
the
lord
but
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
world
how
he
may
please
his
wife
cor
therefore
let
the
priest
who
should
please
god
continually
flee
from
anxiety
for
a
wife
and
not
look
back
with
lot
wife
moreover
sacerdotal
continence
was
foreshadowed
also
in
the
old
testament
for
moses
commanded
those
who
were
to
receive
the
law
not
to
approach
their
wives
until
the
third
day
ex
much
less
therefore
should
the
priests
who
are
about
to
receive
christ
as
our
legislator
lord
and
savior
approach
wives
priests
were
commanded
likewise
to
wear
linen
to
cover
the
shame
of
the
flesh
ex
which
says
beda
was
a
symbol
of
future
continence
among
priests
also
when
ahimelech
was
about
to
give
the
blessed
bread
to
the
servants
of
david
he
asked
first
if
they
had
kept
themselves
from
women
and
david
replied
that
they
had
for
three
days
kings
sam
therefore
they
who
take
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
john
should
always
be
pure
with
respect
to
them
they
who
ate
the
passover
had
their
loins
girded
ex
wherefore
the
priests
who
frequently
eat
christ
our
passover
ought
to
gird
their
loins
by
continence
and
cleanliness
as
the
lord
commands
them
be
ye
clean
he
says
that
bear
the
vessels
of
the
lord
isa
ye
shall
be
holy
for
i
am
holy
lev
therefore
let
priests
serve
god
in
holiness
and
righteousness
all
their
days
luke
hence
the
holy
martyr
cyprian
testifies
that
it
was
revealed
to
him
by
the
lord
and
he
was
most
solemnly
enjoined
to
earnestly
admonish
the
clergy
not
to
occupy
a
domicile
in
common
with
women
hence
since
sacerdotal
continence
has
been
commanded
by
the
pontiffs
and
revealed
by
god
and
promised
to
god
by
the
priest
in
a
special
vow
it
must
not
be
rejected
for
this
is
required
by
the
excellency
of
the
sacrifice
they
offer
the
frequency
of
prayer
and
liberty
and
purity
of
spirit
that
they
care
how
to
please
god
according
to
the
teaching
of
paul
and
because
this
is
manifestly
the
ancient
heresy
of
jovinian
which
the
roman
church
condemned
and
jerome
refuted
in
his
writings
and
augustine
said
that
this
heresy
was
immediately
extinguished
and
did
not
attain
to
the
corruption
and
abuse
of
priests
the
princes
ought
not
to
tolerate
it
to
the
perpetual
shame
and
disgrace
of
the
roman
empire
but
should
rather
conform
themselves
to
the
church
universal
and
not
be
influenced
by
those
things
which
are
suggested
to
them
for
as
to
what
paul
says
cor
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
jerome
replies
that
paul
is
speaking
of
one
who
has
not
made
a
vow
as
athanasius
and
vulgarius
understand
the
declaration
of
paul
if
a
virgin
marry
she
hath
not
sinned
cor
that
here
a
virgin
is
meant
who
has
not
been
consecrated
to
god
so
in
reference
to
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
burn
cor
the
pointed
reply
of
jerome
against
jovinian
is
extant
for
the
same
paul
says
cor
it
is
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
for
a
priest
has
the
intermediate
position
of
neither
marrying
nor
burning
but
of
restraining
himself
by
the
grace
of
god
which
he
obtains
of
god
by
devout
prayer
and
chastising
of
the
flesh
by
fasting
and
vigils
furthermore
when
they
say
that
christ
taught
that
all
men
are
not
fit
for
celibacy
it
is
indeed
true
and
on
this
account
not
all
are
fit
for
the
priesthood
but
let
the
priest
pray
and
he
will
be
ble
to
receive
christ
word
concerning
continence
as
paul
says
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
which
strengtheneth
me
phil
for
continence
is
a
gift
of
god
wisd
besides
when
they
allege
that
this
is
god
ordinance
and
command
jerome
replied
concerning
these
words
a
thousand
years
ago
it
was
necessary
first
to
plant
the
forest
and
that
it
grow
in
order
that
that
might
be
which
could
afterwards
be
cut
down
then
the
command
was
given
concerning
the
procreation
of
offspring
that
the
earth
should
be
replenished
but
since
it
has
been
replenished
so
that
there
is
a
pressure
of
nations
the
commandment
does
not
pertain
in
like
manner
upon
those
able
to
be
continent
in
vain
too
do
they
boast
of
god
express
order
let
them
show
if
they
can
where
god
has
enjoined
priests
to
marry
besides
we
find
in
the
divine
law
that
vows
once
offered
should
be
paid
ps
and
eccles
ps
eccles
why
therefore
do
they
not
observe
this
express
divine
law
they
also
pervert
paul
as
though
he
teaches
that
one
who
is
to
be
chosen
bishop
should
be
married
when
he
says
let
a
bishop
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
which
is
not
to
be
understood
as
though
he
ought
to
be
married
for
then
martin
nicolaus
titus
john
the
evangelist
yea
christ
would
not
have
been
bishops
hence
jerome
explains
the
words
of
paul
that
a
bishop
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
as
meaning
that
he
be
not
a
bigamist
the
truth
of
this
exposition
is
clear
not
only
from
the
authority
of
jerome
which
ought
to
be
great
with
every
catholic
but
also
from
paul
who
writes
concerning
the
selection
of
widows
let
not
a
widow
be
taken
into
the
number
under
three
score
years
having
been
the
wife
of
one
man
tim
lastly
the
citation
of
what
was
done
among
the
germans
is
the
statement
of
a
fact
but
not
of
a
law
for
while
there
was
a
contention
between
the
emperor
henry
iv
and
the
roman
pontiff
and
also
between
his
son
and
the
nobles
of
the
empire
both
divine
and
human
laws
were
equally
confused
so
that
at
the
time
the
laity
rashly
attempted
to
administer
sacred
things
to
use
filth
instead
of
holy
oil
to
baptize
and
to
do
much
else
foreign
to
the
christian
religion
the
clergy
likewise
went
beyond
their
sphere
a
precedent
which
can
not
be
cited
as
law
neither
was
it
regarded
unjust
to
dissolve
sacrilegious
marriages
which
had
been
contracted
to
no
effect
in
opposition
to
vows
and
the
sanction
of
fathers
and
councils
as
even
today
the
marriages
of
priests
with
their
wives
are
not
valid
in
vain
therefore
do
they
complain
that
the
world
is
growing
old
and
that
as
a
remedy
for
infirmity
rigor
should
be
relaxed
for
those
who
are
consecrated
to
god
have
other
remedies
of
infirmities
as
for
instance
let
them
avoid
the
society
of
women
shun
idleness
macerate
the
flesh
by
fasting
and
vigils
keep
the
outward
senses
especially
sight
and
hearing
from
things
forbidden
turn
away
their
eyes
from
beholding
vanity
and
finally
dash
their
little
ones
their
carnal
thoughts
upon
a
rock
and
christ
is
the
rock
suppress
their
passions
and
frequently
and
devoutly
resort
to
god
in
prayer
these
are
undoubtedly
the
most
effectual
remedies
for
incontinence
in
ecclesiastics
and
servants
of
god
paul
said
aright
that
the
doctrine
of
those
who
forbid
marriage
is
a
doctrine
of
demons
such
was
the
doctrine
of
tatian
and
marcoin
whom
augustine
and
jerome
have
mentioned
but
the
church
does
not
thus
forbid
marriage
as
she
even
enumerates
marriage
among
the
seven
sacraments
with
which
however
it
is
consistent
that
on
account
of
their
superior
ministry
she
should
enjoin
upon
ecclesiastics
superior
purity
for
it
is
false
that
there
is
an
express
charge
concerning
contracting
marriage
for
then
john
the
evangelist
james
laurentius
titus
martin
catharine
barbara
would
have
sinned
nor
is
cyprian
influenced
by
these
considerations
to
speak
of
a
virgin
who
had
made
a
solemn
vow
but
of
one
who
had
determined
to
live
continently
as
the
beginning
of
letter
book
i
sufficiently
shows
for
the
judgement
of
augustine
is
very
explicit
it
is
damnable
for
virgins
who
make
a
vow
not
only
to
marry
but
even
to
wish
to
marry
hence
the
abuse
of
marriage
and
the
breaking
of
vows
in
the
clergy
are
not
to
be
tolerated
iii
of
the
mass
whatever
in
this
article
is
stated
concerning
the
most
holy
office
of
the
mass
that
agrees
with
the
holy
roman
and
apostolic
church
is
approved
but
whatever
is
added
that
is
contrary
to
the
observance
of
the
general
and
universal
orthodox
church
is
rejected
because
it
grievously
offends
god
injures
christian
unity
and
occasions
dissensions
tumults
and
seditions
in
the
holy
roman
empire
now
as
to
these
things
which
they
state
in
the
article
first
it
is
displeasing
that
in
opposition
to
the
usage
of
the
entire
roman
church
they
perform
ecclesiastical
rites
not
in
the
roman
but
in
the
german
language
and
this
they
pretend
that
they
do
upon
the
authority
of
paul
who
taught
that
in
the
church
a
language
should
be
used
which
is
understood
by
the
people
cor
but
if
this
were
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
paul
it
would
compel
them
to
perform
the
entire
mass
in
german
which
even
they
do
not
do
but
since
the
priest
is
a
person
belonging
to
the
entire
church
and
not
only
to
his
surroundings
it
is
not
wonderful
that
the
priest
celebrates
the
mass
in
the
latin
language
in
a
latin
church
it
is
profitable
to
the
hearer
however
if
he
hear
the
mass
in
faith
of
the
church
and
experience
teaches
that
among
the
germans
there
has
been
greater
devotion
at
mass
in
christ
believers
who
do
not
understand
the
latin
language
than
in
those
who
today
hear
the
mass
in
german
and
if
the
words
of
the
apostle
be
pondered
it
is
sufficient
that
the
one
replying
occupy
the
place
of
the
unlearned
to
say
amen
the
very
thing
that
the
canons
prescribe
neither
is
it
necessary
that
he
hear
or
understand
all
the
words
of
the
mass
and
even
attend
to
it
intelligently
for
it
is
better
to
understand
and
to
attend
to
its
end
because
the
mass
is
celebrated
in
order
that
the
eucharist
may
be
offered
in
memory
of
christ
passion
and
it
is
an
argument
in
favor
of
this
that
according
to
the
general
opinion
of
the
fathers
the
apostles
and
their
successors
until
the
times
of
the
emperor
hadrian
celebrated
the
mass
in
the
hebrew
language
alone
which
was
indeed
unknown
to
the
christians
especially
the
converted
heathen
but
even
if
the
mass
had
been
celebrated
in
the
primitive
church
in
a
tongue
understood
by
the
people
nevertheless
this
would
not
be
necessary
now
for
many
were
daily
converted
who
were
ignorant
of
the
ceremonies
and
unacquainted
with
the
mysteries
and
hence
it
was
of
advantage
for
them
to
understand
the
words
of
the
office
but
now
catholics
imbibe
from
their
cradles
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
church
whence
they
readily
know
what
should
be
done
at
every
time
in
the
church
moreover
as
to
their
complaints
concerning
the
abuse
of
masses
there
is
none
of
those
who
think
aright
but
does
not
earnestly
desire
that
the
abuses
be
corrected
that
they
who
wait
at
the
altar
live
of
the
altar
is
not
an
abuse
but
pertains
equally
to
both
divine
and
human
who
goeth
a
warfare
any
time
at
his
own
charge
says
paul
do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
temple
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
altar
cor
christ
says
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
luke
but
worthy
of
censure
above
all
things
is
the
discontinuance
of
the
private
mass
in
certain
places
as
though
those
having
fixed
and
prescribed
returns
are
sought
no
less
than
the
public
masses
on
account
of
gain
but
by
this
abrogation
of
masses
the
worship
of
god
is
diminished
honor
is
withdrawn
from
the
saints
the
ultimate
will
of
the
founder
is
overthrown
and
defeated
the
dead
deprived
of
the
rights
due
them
and
the
devotion
of
the
living
withdrawn
and
chilled
therefore
the
abrogation
of
private
masses
can
not
be
conceded
and
tolerated
neither
can
their
assumption
be
sufficiently
understood
that
christ
by
his
passion
has
made
satisfaction
for
original
sin
and
has
instituted
the
mass
for
actual
sin
for
this
has
never
been
heard
by
catholics
and
very
many
who
are
now
asked
most
constantly
deny
that
they
have
so
taught
for
the
mass
does
not
abolish
sins
which
are
destroyed
by
repentance
as
their
peculiar
medicine
but
abolishes
the
punishment
due
sin
supplies
satisfactions
and
confers
increase
of
grace
and
salutary
protection
of
the
living
and
lastly
brings
the
hope
of
divine
consolation
and
aid
to
all
our
wants
and
necessities
again
their
insinuations
that
in
the
mass
christ
is
not
offered
must
be
altogether
rejected
as
condemned
of
old
and
excluded
by
the
faithful
for
augustine
says
this
was
a
very
ancient
heresy
of
the
arians
who
denied
that
in
the
mass
an
oblation
was
made
for
the
living
and
the
dead
for
this
is
opposed
both
to
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
entire
church
for
through
malachi
the
lord
predicted
the
rejection
of
the
jews
the
call
of
the
gentiles
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
evangelical
law
i
have
no
pleasure
in
you
he
saith
neither
will
i
accept
an
offering
at
your
hand
for
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
even
unto
the
going
down
of
the
same
my
name
shall
be
great
among
the
gentiles
and
in
every
place
incense
shall
be
offered
unto
my
name
and
a
pure
offering
mal
but
no
pure
offering
has
already
been
offered
to
god
in
every
place
except
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
altar
of
the
most
pure
eucharist
this
authority
augustine
and
other
catholics
have
used
in
favor
of
the
mass
against
faithless
jews
and
certainly
with
catholic
princes
it
should
have
greater
influence
than
all
objections
of
the
adversaries
besides
in
speaking
of
the
advent
of
the
messiah
the
same
prophet
says
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
levi
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
lord
an
offering
in
righteousness
then
shall
the
offering
of
judah
and
jerusalem
be
pleasant
unto
the
lord
as
in
the
days
of
old
and
as
in
former
years
mal
here
in
the
spirit
the
prophet
foresaw
the
sons
of
levi
evangelical
priests
says
jerome
about
to
offer
sacrifices
not
in
the
blood
of
goats
but
in
righteousness
as
in
the
days
of
old
hence
these
words
are
repeated
by
the
church
in
the
canon
of
the
mass
under
the
influence
of
the
same
spirit
under
whose
influence
they
were
written
by
the
prophet
the
angel
also
said
to
daniel
many
shall
be
purified
and
made
white
and
tried
but
the
wicked
shall
do
wickedly
and
none
of
the
wicked
shall
understand
and
again
the
wise
shall
understand
and
from
the
time
that
the
daily
sacrifices
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
set
up
there
shall
be
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
days
dan
christ
testifies
that
this
prophecy
is
to
be
fulfilled
but
that
it
has
not
been
as
yet
fulfilled
matt
therefore
the
daily
sacrifice
of
christ
will
cease
universally
at
the
advent
of
the
abomination
of
antichrist
just
as
it
has
already
ceased
particularly
in
some
churches
and
thus
will
be
unemployed
in
the
place
of
desolation
viz
when
the
churches
will
be
desolated
in
which
the
canonical
hours
will
not
be
chanted
or
the
masses
celebrated
or
the
sacraments
administered
and
there
will
be
no
altars
no
images
of
saints
no
candles
no
furniture
therefore
all
princes
and
faithful
subjects
of
the
roman
empire
ought
to
be
encouraged
never
to
admit
or
pass
over
anything
that
may
aid
the
preparers
of
antichrist
in
attaining
such
a
degree
of
wickedness
when
the
woman
the
catholic
church
as
john
saw
in
the
spirit
will
flee
into
the
wilderness
where
she
will
have
a
place
prepared
of
god
that
she
may
be
nourished
there
twelve
hundred
and
sixty
days
rev
finally
paul
says
heb
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
god
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins
but
since
the
external
priesthood
has
not
ceased
in
the
new
law
but
has
been
changed
to
a
better
therefore
even
today
the
high
priest
and
the
entire
priesthood
offer
in
the
church
an
external
sacrifice
which
is
only
one
the
eucharist
to
this
topic
that
also
is
applicable
which
is
read
according
to
the
new
translation
in
acts
barnabas
simeon
lucius
of
cyrene
manaen
and
saul
sacrificed
they
offered
an
oblation
which
can
and
ought
justly
to
be
understood
not
of
an
oblation
made
to
idols
but
of
the
mass
since
it
is
called
by
the
greeks
liturgy
and
that
in
the
primitive
church
the
mass
was
a
sacrifice
the
holy
fathers
copiously
testify
and
they
support
this
opinion
for
ignatius
a
pupil
of
john
the
apostle
says
it
is
not
allowable
without
a
bishop
either
to
offer
a
sacrifice
or
to
celebrate
masses
and
irenaeus
a
pupil
of
john
clearly
testifies
that
christ
taught
the
new
oblation
of
the
new
testament
which
the
church
receiving
from
the
apostles
offers
to
god
throughout
the
entire
world
this
bishop
bordering
upon
the
times
of
the
apostles
testifies
that
the
new
evangelical
sacrifice
was
offered
throughout
the
entire
world
origin
cyprian
jerome
chrysostom
augustine
basil
hilary
teach
and
testify
the
same
whose
words
for
brevity
sake
are
omitted
since
therefore
the
catholic
church
throughout
the
entire
christian
world
has
always
taught
held
and
observed
as
it
today
holds
and
observes
the
same
ought
today
to
be
held
and
observed
inviolably
nor
does
paul
in
hebrews
oppose
the
oblation
of
the
mass
when
he
says
that
by
one
offering
we
have
once
been
justified
through
christ
for
paul
is
speaking
of
the
offering
of
a
victim
of
a
bloody
sacrifice
of
a
lamb
slain
viz
upon
the
cross
which
offering
was
indeed
once
made
whereby
all
sacraments
and
even
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
have
their
efficacy
therefore
he
was
offered
but
once
with
the
shedding
of
blood
viz
upon
the
cross
today
he
is
offered
in
the
mass
as
a
peace
making
and
sacramental
victim
then
he
was
offered
in
a
visible
form
capable
of
suffering
today
he
is
offered
in
the
mass
veiled
in
mysteries
incapable
of
suffering
just
as
in
the
old
testament
he
was
sacrificed
typically
and
under
a
figure
finally
the
force
of
the
word
shows
that
the
mass
is
a
sacrifice
since
mass
is
nothing
but
oblation
and
has
received
its
name
from
the
hebrew
word
misbeach
altar
in
greek
thysiasterion
on
account
of
the
oblation
it
has
been
sufficiently
declared
above
that
we
are
justified
not
properly
by
faith
but
by
love
but
if
any
such
statement
be
found
in
the
holy
scriptures
catholics
know
that
it
is
declared
concerning
fides
formata
which
works
by
love
gal
and
because
justification
is
begun
by
faith
because
it
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
heb
neither
is
it
denied
that
the
mass
is
a
memorial
of
christ
passion
and
god
benefits
since
this
is
approved
b
the
figure
of
the
paschal
lamb
that
was
at
the
same
time
a
victim
and
a
memorial
ex
and
is
represented
not
only
by
the
word
and
sacraments
but
also
by
holy
postures
and
vestments
in
the
catholic
church
but
to
the
memory
of
the
victim
the
church
offers
anew
the
eucharist
in
the
mysteries
to
god
the
father
almighty
therefore
the
princes
and
cities
are
not
censured
for
retaining
one
common
mass
in
the
church
provided
they
do
this
according
to
the
sacred
canon
as
observed
by
all
catholics
but
in
abrogating
all
other
masses
they
have
done
what
the
christian
profession
does
not
allow
nor
does
any
one
censure
the
declaration
that
of
old
all
who
were
present
communed
would
that
all
were
so
disposed
as
to
be
prepared
to
partake
of
this
bread
worthily
every
day
but
if
they
regard
one
mass
advantageous
how
much
more
advantageous
would
be
a
number
of
masses
of
which
they
nevertheless
have
unjustly
disapproved
when
all
these
things
are
properly
considered
we
must
ask
them
to
altogether
annul
and
repudiate
this
new
form
of
celebrating
the
mass
that
has
been
devised
and
has
been
already
so
frequently
changed
and
to
resume
the
primitive
form
for
celebrating
it
according
to
the
ancient
rite
and
custom
of
the
churches
of
germany
and
all
christendom
and
to
restore
the
abrogated
masses
according
to
the
ultimate
will
of
their
founders
whereby
they
would
gain
advantage
and
honor
for
themselves
and
peace
and
tranquility
for
all
germany
iv
of
confession
as
to
confession
we
must
adhere
to
the
reply
and
judgement
given
above
in
article
xi
for
the
support
which
they
claim
from
chrysostom
is
false
since
they
pervert
to
sacramental
and
sacerdotal
confession
what
he
says
concerning
public
confession
as
his
words
clearly
indicate
when
in
the
beginning
he
says
i
do
not
tell
thee
to
disclose
thyself
to
the
public
or
to
accuse
thyself
before
others
thus
gratian
and
thus
peter
lombard
replied
three
hundred
years
ago
and
the
explanation
becomes
still
more
manifest
from
other
passages
of
chrysostom
for
in
his
sermon
he
says
of
the
penitent
in
his
heart
is
contrition
in
his
mouth
confession
in
his
entire
work
humility
this
is
perfect
and
fruitful
repentance
does
not
this
most
exactly
display
the
three
parts
of
repentance
so
in
his
tenth
homily
on
matthew
chrysostom
teaches
of
a
fixed
time
for
confession
and
that
after
the
wounds
of
crimes
have
been
opened
they
should
be
healed
penance
intervening
but
how
will
crimes
lie
open
if
they
are
not
disclosed
to
the
priest
by
confession
thus
in
several
passages
chrysostom
himself
refutes
this
opinion
which
jerome
also
overthrows
saying
if
the
serpent
the
devil
have
secretly
bitten
any
one
and
without
the
knowledge
f
another
have
infected
him
with
the
poison
of
sin
if
he
who
has
been
struck
be
silent
and
do
not
repent
and
be
unwilling
to
confess
his
wound
to
his
brother
and
instructor
the
instructor
who
has
a
tongue
wherewith
to
cure
him
will
not
readily
be
able
to
profit
him
for
if
the
sick
man
be
ashamed
to
confess
to
the
physician
the
medicine
is
not
adapted
to
that
of
which
he
is
ignorant
let
the
princes
and
cities
therefore
believe
these
authors
rather
than
a
single
gloss
upon
a
decree
questioned
and
rejected
by
those
who
are
skilled
in
divine
law
wherefore
since
a
full
confession
is
not
to
say
necessary
for
salvation
but
becomes
the
nerve
of
christian
discipline
and
the
entire
obedience
they
must
be
admonished
to
conform
to
the
orthodox
church
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
jerome
this
was
the
heresy
of
the
montanist
who
were
condemned
over
twelve
hundred
years
ago
because
they
were
ashamed
to
confess
their
sins
it
is
not
becoming
therefore
to
adopt
the
error
of
the
wicked
montanus
but
rather
the
rite
of
the
holy
fathers
and
the
entire
church
viz
that
each
one
teach
according
to
the
norm
of
the
orthodox
faith
that
confession
the
chief
treasure
in
the
church
be
made
in
conformity
to
the
rite
kept
among
them
also
in
the
church
of
the
distinction
of
meats
what
they
afterwards
assert
concerning
the
distinction
of
meats
and
like
traditions
of
which
they
seem
to
make
no
account
must
be
rejected
for
we
know
from
the
apostle
that
all
power
is
of
god
and
especially
that
ecclesiastical
power
has
been
given
by
god
for
edification
for
this
reason
from
the
christian
and
devout
heart
of
the
holy
church
the
constitutions
of
the
same
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
should
be
received
as
are
useful
to
the
church
as
well
for
promoting
divine
worship
as
for
restraining
the
lust
of
the
flesh
while
they
enable
us
the
more
readily
to
keep
the
divine
commands
and
when
well
considered
are
found
in
the
holy
scriptures
and
he
who
despises
or
rashly
resists
them
grievously
offends
god
according
to
christ
word
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
me
luke
a
prelate
however
is
despised
when
his
statutes
are
despised
according
to
paul
not
only
when
he
says
he
that
despiseth
despiseth
not
man
but
god
who
hath
also
given
unto
us
his
holy
spirit
thess
but
also
to
the
bishops
take
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
over
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
rule
vulgate
the
church
of
god
acts
if
prelates
therefore
have
the
power
to
rule
they
will
have
the
power
also
to
make
statutes
for
the
salutary
government
of
the
church
and
the
growth
of
subjects
for
the
same
apostle
enjoined
upon
the
corinthians
that
among
them
all
things
should
be
done
in
order
cor
but
this
can
not
be
done
without
laws
on
that
account
he
said
to
the
hebrews
obey
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you
and
submit
yourselves
for
they
watch
for
your
souls
as
they
that
must
give
an
account
heb
here
paul
reckons
not
only
obedience
but
also
the
reason
for
obedience
we
see
that
paul
exercised
this
power
as
in
addition
to
the
gospel
he
prescribed
so
many
laws
concerning
the
choice
of
a
bishop
concerning
widows
concerning
women
that
they
have
their
heads
veiled
that
they
be
silent
in
the
church
and
concerning
even
secular
matters
thess
concerning
civil
courts
cor
and
he
says
to
the
corinthians
very
clearly
but
to
the
rest
speak
i
not
the
lord
cor
and
again
he
says
elsewhere
stand
fast
and
hold
the
traditions
which
ye
have
been
taught
whether
by
word
or
our
epistle
thess
wherefore
the
princes
and
cities
must
be
admonished
to
render
obedience
to
ecclesiastical
statutes
and
constitutions
lest
when
they
withdraw
obedience
that
is
due
god
obedience
may
be
withdrawn
also
from
them
by
their
subjects
as
their
subjects
attempted
in
the
recent
civil
insurrection
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
seduced
by
false
doctrines
most
false
also
is
their
declaration
that
the
righteousness
of
faith
is
obscured
by
such
ordinances
nay
he
is
rather
mad
and
insane
who
would
observe
them
without
faith
for
they
are
given
to
believers
and
not
to
turks
or
ishmaelites
for
what
have
i
to
do
to
judge
them
that
are
without
cor
moreover
in
extolling
here
faith
above
all
things
they
antagonize
paul
as
we
have
said
above
and
do
violence
to
paul
whom
they
pervert
to
evangelical
works
when
he
speaks
of
legal
works
as
all
these
errors
have
been
above
refuted
false
also
is
it
that
ecclesiastical
ordinances
obscure
god
commands
since
they
prepare
man
for
these
as
fasts
suppress
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
help
him
from
falling
into
luxury
false
also
is
it
that
it
is
impossible
to
observe
ordinances
for
the
church
is
not
a
cruel
mother
who
makes
no
exceptions
in
the
celebration
of
festivals
and
in
fasting
and
the
like
furthermore
they
falsely
quote
augustine
in
reply
to
the
inquiries
of
januarius
who
is
diametrically
opposed
to
them
for
in
this
place
he
most
clearly
states
that
what
has
been
universally
delivered
by
the
church
be
also
universally
observed
but
in
indifferent
things
and
those
whose
observance
and
are
free
the
holy
father
augustine
states
that
according
to
the
authority
of
ambrose
the
custom
of
each
church
should
be
observed
when
i
come
back
to
rome
he
says
i
fast
on
the
sabbath
but
when
here
i
do
not
fast
besides
they
do
violence
to
the
scriptures
while
they
endeavor
to
support
their
errors
for
christ
matt
does
not
absolutely
disapprove
of
human
ordinances
but
of
those
only
that
were
opposed
to
the
law
of
god
as
is
clearly
acknowledged
in
mark
here
also
matt
says
why
do
ye
also
transgress
the
commandment
of
god
by
your
tradition
so
paul
forbids
that
any
one
be
judged
in
meat
or
in
drink
or
in
respect
to
the
sabbath
after
the
jewish
manner
for
when
the
church
forbids
meats
it
does
not
judge
them
to
be
unclean
as
the
jews
in
the
synagogue
thought
so
the
declaration
of
christ
concerning
that
which
goeth
into
the
mouth
matt
is
cited
here
without
a
sure
and
true
understanding
of
it
since
its
intention
was
to
remove
the
error
of
the
jews
who
thought
that
food
touched
by
unwashen
hands
becomes
unclean
and
rendered
one
eating
it
unclean
as
is
manifest
from
the
context
nor
does
the
church
bring
back
to
these
observances
moses
with
his
heavy
hands
in
like
manner
they
do
violence
to
paul
for
tim
he
calls
that
a
doctrine
of
demons
that
forbids
meats
as
the
tatianites
marcionites
and
manichaeans
thought
that
meats
were
unclean
as
is
clear
from
the
words
that
follow
when
paul
adds
every
creature
of
god
is
good
but
the
church
does
not
forbid
meats
on
the
ground
that
they
are
evil
or
unclean
but
as
an
easier
way
to
keep
god
commandments
therefore
the
opposite
arguments
fail
if
they
would
preach
the
cross
and
bodily
discipline
and
fasts
that
in
this
way
the
body
be
reduced
to
subjection
their
doctrine
would
be
commendable
but
their
desire
that
these
be
free
is
condemned
and
rejected
as
alien
to
the
faith
and
discipline
of
the
church
nor
does
the
diversity
of
rites
support
them
for
this
is
properly
allowed
in
regard
to
particular
matters
in
order
that
each
individual
province
may
have
its
own
taste
satisfied
as
jerome
says
but
individual
ecclesiastical
rites
should
be
universally
observed
and
special
rites
should
be
observed
each
in
their
own
province
also
they
make
no
mention
of
easter
for
the
roman
pontiffs
reduced
the
asiatics
to
a
uniform
observance
of
easter
with
the
universal
church
in
this
way
irenaeus
must
be
understood
for
without
the
loss
of
faith
some
vigils
of
the
apostles
were
not
celebrated
with
fasting
throughout
gaul
which
germany
nevertheless
observes
in
fasts
the
princes
and
cities
must
also
be
admonished
to
follow
the
decision
of
pope
gregory
for
he
enjoins
that
the
custom
of
each
province
be
observed
if
it
employs
nothing
contrary
to
the
catholic
faith
canon
quoniam
distinct
xii
hence
we
are
not
ignorant
that
there
is
a
various
observance
of
dissimilar
rites
in
unity
of
faith
which
should
be
observed
in
every
province
as
it
has
been
delivered
and
received
from
the
ancients
without
injury
however
to
the
universal
rites
of
the
entire
catholic
church
vi
of
monastic
vows
although
many
and
various
matters
have
been
introduced
in
this
article
by
the
suggestion
of
certain
persons
another
text
cod
reads
preachers
nevertheless
when
all
are
taken
into
consideration
with
mature
thought
since
monastic
vows
have
their
foundation
in
the
holy
scriptures
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
most
holy
men
renowned
and
admirable
by
miracles
have
lived
in
these
religious
orders
with
many
thousand
thousands
and
for
so
many
centuries
their
ordinances
and
rules
of
living
have
been
received
and
approved
throughout
the
entire
christian
world
by
the
catholic
church
it
is
in
no
way
to
be
tolerated
that
vows
are
licentiously
broken
without
any
fear
of
god
for
in
the
old
testament
god
approved
the
vows
of
the
nazarenes
num
and
the
vows
of
the
rechabites
who
neither
drank
wine
or
ate
grapes
jer
while
he
strictly
requires
that
the
vow
once
made
be
paid
deut
it
is
ruin
to
a
man
after
vows
to
retract
prov
the
vows
of
the
just
are
acceptable
prov
god
also
teaches
specifically
through
the
prophet
that
monastic
vows
please
him
for
in
isa
it
is
read
as
follows
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
eunuchs
that
keep
my
sabbath
and
choose
the
things
that
pease
me
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant
even
unto
them
will
i
give
in
mine
house
and
within
my
walls
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
that
of
sons
and
of
daughters
i
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
but
to
what
eunuchs
does
god
make
these
promises
to
those
undoubtedly
whom
christ
praises
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
sake
matt
to
those
undoubtedly
who
denying
their
own
come
after
christ
and
deny
themselves
and
follow
him
luke
so
that
they
are
governed
no
longer
by
their
own
will
but
by
that
of
their
rule
and
superior
in
like
manner
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
apostle
those
virgins
do
better
who
contemning
the
world
and
spurning
its
enticements
vow
and
maintain
virginity
in
monasteries
than
those
who
place
their
necks
beneath
the
matrimonial
burden
for
thus
paul
says
cor
he
that
giveth
her
in
marriage
doeth
well
but
he
that
giveth
her
not
in
marriage
doeth
better
also
concerning
a
widow
he
continues
she
is
happier
if
she
so
abide
after
my
judgment
no
one
is
ignorant
of
the
holiness
of
the
hermit
paul
of
basil
anthony
benedict
bernard
dominic
franciscus
wiliam
augustine
clara
bridget
and
similar
hermits
who
indeed
despised
the
entire
realm
of
the
world
and
all
the
splendor
of
the
age
on
account
of
love
to
our
lord
jesus
christ
moreover
the
heresy
of
the
lampetians
was
condemned
in
most
ancient
times
which
the
heretic
jovinian
attempted
in
vain
to
revive
at
rome
therefore
all
things
must
be
rejected
which
in
this
article
have
been
produced
against
monasticism
viz
that
monasteries
succeeded
vows
of
the
nunneries
it
is
sufficiently
ascertained
that
though
pertaining
to
the
weaker
sex
how
in
most
cloisters
the
holy
nuns
persevered
far
more
constantly
to
vows
once
uttered
even
under
these
princes
and
cities
than
th
majority
of
monks
even
to
this
day
it
has
been
impossible
to
move
them
from
their
holy
purpose
by
any
prayers
blandishments
threats
terrors
difficulties
or
distresses
wherefore
those
matters
are
not
to
be
admitted
which
are
interpreted
unfavorably
since
it
has
been
expressly
declared
in
the
holy
scriptures
that
the
monastic
life
when
kept
with
proper
observance
as
may
by
the
grace
of
god
be
rendered
by
any
monks
merits
eternal
life
and
indeed
christ
has
promised
to
them
a
much
more
bountiful
reward
saying
every
one
that
hath
forsaken
houses
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
name
sake
shall
receive
an
and
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
matt
that
monasteries
as
they
show
were
formerly
literary
schools
is
not
denied
nevertheless
there
is
no
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
these
were
at
first
schools
of
virtues
and
discipline
to
which
literature
was
afterwards
added
but
since
no
one
putting
his
hand
to
the
plough
and
looking
back
is
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
luke
all
marriages
and
breaking
of
vows
by
monks
and
nuns
should
be
regarded
as
condemned
according
to
the
tenor
not
only
of
the
holy
scriptures
but
also
of
the
laws
and
canons
having
damnation
because
they
have
cast
off
their
first
faith
as
paul
says
tim
moreover
that
vows
are
not
contrary
to
the
ordinance
of
god
as
been
declared
with
reference
to
the
second
article
of
the
alleged
abuses
that
they
attempt
to
defend
themselves
by
dispensations
of
the
pope
is
of
no
effect
for
although
the
pope
has
perhaps
made
a
dispensation
for
the
king
of
aragon
who
we
read
returned
to
the
monastery
after
having
had
offspring
or
for
any
other
prince
on
account
of
the
peace
of
the
entire
kingdom
or
province
to
prevent
the
exposure
of
the
entire
kingdom
or
province
to
wars
carnage
pillae
debauchery
conflagrations
murders
nevertheless
in
private
persons
who
abandon
vows
in
apostasy
such
grounds
for
dispensations
can
not
be
urged
for
the
assumption
is
repelled
that
the
vow
concerns
a
matter
that
is
impossible
for
continence
which
so
many
thousands
of
men
and
virgins
have
maintained
is
not
impossible
for
although
the
wise
man
says
wisd
i
knew
that
i
could
not
otherwise
be
continent
unless
god
gave
it
me
nevertheless
christ
promised
to
give
it
seek
he
says
and
ye
shall
find
matt
and
paul
says
god
is
faithful
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempted
above
that
ye
are
able
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
escape
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
it
cor
they
are
also
poor
defenders
of
their
cause
when
they
admit
that
the
violation
of
a
vow
is
irreprehensible
and
it
must
be
declared
that
by
law
such
marriages
are
censured
and
should
be
dissolved
ut
continentiae
xxvii
q
as
also
by
the
ancient
statutes
of
emperors
but
when
they
allege
in
their
favor
nuptiarum
they
accomplish
nothing
for
it
speaks
of
a
simple
not
of
a
religious
vow
which
the
church
observes
also
to
this
day
the
marriages
of
monks
nuns
or
priests
have
therefore
never
been
ratified
futile
also
is
their
statement
that
a
votive
life
is
an
invention
of
men
for
it
has
been
founded
upon
the
holy
scriptures
inspired
into
the
most
holy
fathers
by
the
holy
ghost
nor
does
it
deny
honor
to
christ
since
monks
observe
all
things
for
christ
sake
and
imitate
christ
false
therefore
is
the
judgement
whereby
they
condemn
monastic
service
as
godless
whereas
it
is
most
christian
for
the
monks
have
not
fallen
from
god
grace
as
the
jews
of
whom
paul
speaks
gal
when
they
still
sought
justification
by
the
law
of
moses
but
the
monks
endeavor
to
live
more
nearly
to
the
gospel
that
theymay
merit
eternal
life
therefore
the
allegations
here
made
against
monasticism
are
impious
moreover
the
malicious
charge
that
is
still
further
added
that
those
in
religious
orders
claim
to
be
in
a
state
of
perfection
has
never
been
heard
of
by
them
for
those
in
these
orders
claim
not
for
themselves
a
state
of
perfection
but
only
a
state
in
which
to
acquire
perfection
because
their
regulations
are
instruments
of
perfection
and
not
perfection
itself
in
this
manner
gerson
must
be
received
who
does
not
deny
that
religious
orders
are
states
wherein
to
acquire
perfection
as
he
declares
in
his
treatises
against
the
proprietors
of
the
rule
of
augustine
of
evangelical
counsels
of
perfection
of
heart
and
in
other
places
for
this
reason
the
princes
and
cities
should
be
admonished
to
strive
rather
for
the
reformation
of
the
monasteries
by
their
legitimate
superiors
than
for
their
subversion
rather
for
the
godly
improvement
of
the
monks
than
that
they
be
abolished
as
their
most
religious
ancestors
most
christian
princes
have
done
but
if
they
will
not
believe
holy
and
most
religious
fathers
defending
monastic
vows
let
them
hear
at
least
his
imperial
highness
the
emperor
justinian
in
authentica
de
monachis
coll
ii
vii
of
ecclesiastical
power
although
many
things
are
introduced
here
in
the
topic
of
ecclesiastical
power
with
greater
bitterness
than
is
just
yet
it
must
be
declared
that
to
most
reverend
bishops
and
priests
and
to
the
entire
clergy
all
ecclesiastical
power
is
freely
conceded
that
belongs
to
them
by
law
or
custom
besides
it
is
proper
to
preserve
for
them
all
immunities
privileges
preferments
and
prerogatives
granted
them
by
roman
emperors
and
kings
nor
can
those
things
that
have
been
granted
ecclesiastics
by
imperial
munificence
or
gift
be
allowed
to
be
infringed
by
any
princes
or
any
other
subject
of
the
roman
empire
for
it
is
most
abundantly
proved
that
ecclesiastical
power
in
spiritual
things
has
been
founded
upon
divine
right
of
which
paul
indeed
says
for
though
i
should
boast
somewhat
more
of
our
authority
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
for
edification
and
not
for
your
destruction
cor
and
afterwards
therefore
i
write
these
things
being
absent
lest
being
present
i
should
use
sharpness
according
to
the
power
which
the
lord
hath
given
me
to
edification
and
not
to
destruction
cor
paul
also
displays
his
coercitive
disposition
when
he
says
what
will
ye
shall
i
come
unto
you
with
a
rod
or
in
love
and
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
cor
and
of
judicial
matters
he
writes
to
timothy
against
an
elder
receive
not
an
accusation
but
before
two
or
three
witnesses
tim
from
these
passages
it
is
very
clearly
discerned
that
bishops
have
the
power
not
only
of
the
ministry
of
the
word
of
god
but
also
of
ruling
and
coercitive
correction
in
order
to
direct
subjects
to
the
goal
of
eternal
blessedness
but
for
the
power
of
ruling
there
is
required
the
power
to
judge
to
define
to
discriminate
and
to
decide
what
is
expedient
or
conducive
to
the
aforesaid
goal
in
vain
therefore
and
futile
is
all
that
is
inserted
in
the
present
article
in
opposition
to
the
immunity
of
churches
and
schools
accordingly
all
subjects
of
the
roman
empire
must
be
forbidden
from
bringing
the
clergy
before
a
civil
tribunal
contrary
to
imperial
privileges
that
have
been
conceded
for
pope
clement
the
martyr
says
if
any
of
the
presbyters
have
trouble
with
one
another
let
whatever
it
be
adjusted
before
the
presbyters
of
the
church
hence
constantine
the
great
the
most
christian
emperor
was
unwilling
in
the
holy
council
of
nice
to
give
judgement
even
in
secular
cases
ye
are
gods
he
says
appointed
by
the
true
god
go
settle
the
case
among
yourselves
be
cause
it
is
not
proper
that
we
judge
gods
as
to
what
is
further
repeated
concerning
church
regulations
has
been
sufficiently
replied
to
above
nor
does
christian
liberty
which
they
bring
forth
as
an
argument
avail
them
since
this
is
not
liberty
but
prodigious
license
which
inculcated
on
the
people
excites
them
to
fatal
and
most
dangerous
sedition
for
christian
liberty
is
not
opposed
to
ecclesiastical
usages
since
they
promote
what
is
good
but
it
is
opposed
to
the
servitude
of
the
mosaic
law
and
the
servitude
of
sin
whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
sin
says
christ
john
hence
their
breaking
fasts
their
free
partaking
of
meats
their
neglect
of
canonical
hours
their
omission
of
confession
viz
at
easter
and
their
commission
and
omission
of
similar
things
are
not
a
use
of
liberty
but
an
abuse
thereof
contrary
to
the
warnings
of
paul
who
earnestly
warned
them
saying
brethren
ye
have
been
called
unto
liberty
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
but
by
love
serve
one
another
gal
hence
no
one
ought
to
conceal
his
crimes
under
the
pretext
of
gospel
liberty
which
peter
also
forbade
as
free
and
not
using
your
liberty
for
an
cloak
of
maliciousness
but
as
the
servant
of
god
pet
as
to
what
they
have
added
concerning
abuses
all
the
princes
and
estates
of
the
empire
undoubtedly
know
that
not
even
the
least
is
approved
either
by
his
imperial
majesty
or
by
any
princes
or
any
christian
man
but
that
both
the
princes
and
the
estates
of
the
empire
desire
to
strive
with
a
common
purpose
and
agreement
in
order
that
the
abuses
being
removed
and
reformed
the
excesses
of
both
estates
may
be
either
utterly
abolished
or
reformed
for
the
better
and
that
the
ecclesiastical
estate
which
has
been
weakened
in
many
ways
and
the
christian
religion
which
has
grown
cold
and
relaxed
in
some
may
be
restored
and
renewed
to
its
pristine
glory
and
distinction
to
this
as
is
evident
to
all
his
imperial
majesty
has
thus
far
devoted
the
greatest
care
and
labor
and
kindly
promises
in
the
future
to
employ
for
this
cause
all
his
means
and
zeal
conclusion
from
the
foregoing
viz
the
confession
and
its
reply
since
his
imperial
majesty
perceives
that
the
elector
the
princes
and
the
cities
agree
on
many
points
with
the
catholic
and
roman
church
and
dissent
from
the
godless
dogmas
that
are
disseminated
all
over
germany
and
the
pamphlets
circulated
everywhere
and
that
they
disapprove
of
and
condemn
them
his
holy
imperial
majesty
is
fully
convinced
and
hopes
that
the
result
will
be
that
when
the
elector
princes
and
cities
have
heard
and
understood
this
reply
they
will
agree
with
united
minds
in
regard
to
those
matters
also
in
which
they
perhaps
have
not
agreed
hitherto
with
the
roman
catholic
church
and
that
in
all
other
things
above
mentioned
they
will
obediently
conform
to
the
catholic
and
roman
church
and
the
christian
faith
and
religion
for
such
conduct
on
their
part
his
imperial
majesty
will
be
peculiarly
grateful
and
will
bestow
his
special
favor
upon
them
all
in
common
and
also
as
opportunity
offers
upon
them
individually
for
which
may
god
forbid
if
this
admonition
so
christian
and
indulgent
be
unheeded
the
elector
princes
and
cities
can
judge
that
a
necessary
cause
is
afforded
his
imperial
majesty
that
as
becometh
a
roman
emperor
and
christian
caesar
and
a
defender
and
advocate
of
the
catholic
and
christian
church
he
must
care
for
such
matters
as
the
nature
of
the
charge
committed
to
him
and
his
integrity
of
conscience
require
