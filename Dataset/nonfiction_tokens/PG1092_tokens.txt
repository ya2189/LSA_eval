the
description
of
wales
by
gerald
of
wales
first
preface
to
stephen
langton
archbishop
of
canterbury
i
who
at
the
expense
of
three
labour
arranged
a
short
time
ago
in
three
parts
the
topography
of
ireland
with
a
description
of
its
natural
curiosities
and
who
afterwards
by
two
study
completed
in
two
parts
the
vaticinal
history
of
its
conquest
and
who
by
publishing
the
itinerary
of
the
holy
man
baldwin
through
cambria
prevented
his
laborious
mission
from
perishing
in
obscurity
do
now
propose
in
the
present
little
work
to
give
some
account
of
this
my
native
country
and
to
describe
the
genius
of
its
inhabitants
so
entirely
distinct
from
that
of
other
nations
and
this
production
of
my
industry
i
have
determined
to
dedicate
to
you
illustrious
stephen
archbishop
of
canterbury
as
i
before
ascribed
to
you
my
itinerary
considering
you
as
a
man
no
less
distinguished
by
your
piety
than
conspicuous
for
your
learning
though
so
humble
an
offering
may
possibly
be
unworthy
the
acceptance
of
a
personage
who
from
his
eminence
deserves
to
be
presented
with
works
of
the
greatest
merit
some
indeed
object
to
this
my
undertaking
and
apparently
from
motives
of
affection
compare
me
to
a
painter
who
rich
in
colours
and
like
another
zeuxis
eminent
in
his
art
is
endeavouring
with
all
his
skill
and
industry
to
give
celebrity
to
a
cottage
or
to
some
other
contemptible
object
whilst
the
world
is
anxiously
expecting
from
his
hand
a
temple
or
a
palace
thus
they
wonder
that
i
amidst
the
many
great
and
striking
subjects
which
the
world
presents
should
choose
to
describe
and
to
adorn
with
all
the
graces
of
composition
such
remote
corners
of
the
earth
as
ireland
and
wales
others
again
reproaching
me
with
greater
severity
say
that
the
gifts
which
have
been
bestowed
upon
me
from
above
ought
not
to
be
wasted
upon
these
insignificant
objects
nor
lavished
in
a
vain
display
of
learning
on
the
commendation
of
princes
who
from
their
ignorance
and
want
of
liberality
have
neither
taste
to
appreciate
nor
hearts
to
remunerate
literary
excellence
and
they
further
add
that
every
faculty
which
emanates
from
the
deity
ought
rather
to
be
applied
to
the
illustration
of
celestial
objects
and
to
the
exultation
of
his
glory
from
whose
abundance
all
our
talents
have
been
received
every
faculty
say
they
ought
to
be
employed
in
praising
him
from
whom
as
from
a
perennial
source
every
perfect
gift
is
derived
and
from
whose
bounty
everything
which
is
offered
with
sincerity
obtains
an
ample
reward
but
since
excellent
histories
of
other
countries
have
been
composed
and
published
by
writers
of
eminence
i
have
been
induced
by
the
love
i
bear
to
my
country
and
to
posterity
to
believe
that
i
should
perform
neither
an
useless
nor
an
unacceptable
service
were
i
to
unfold
the
hidden
merits
of
my
native
land
to
rescue
from
obscurity
those
glorious
actions
which
have
been
hitherto
imperfectly
described
and
to
bring
into
repute
by
my
method
of
treating
it
a
subject
till
now
regarded
as
contemptible
what
indeed
could
my
feeble
and
unexercised
efforts
add
to
the
histories
of
the
destruction
of
troy
thebes
or
athens
or
to
the
conquest
of
the
shores
of
latium
besides
to
do
what
has
been
already
done
is
in
fact
to
be
doing
nothing
i
have
therefore
thought
it
more
eligible
to
apply
my
industry
to
the
arrangement
of
the
history
of
my
native
country
hitherto
almost
wholly
overlooked
by
strangers
but
interesting
to
my
relations
and
countrymen
and
from
these
small
beginnings
to
aspire
by
degrees
to
works
of
a
nobler
cast
from
these
inconsiderable
attempts
some
idea
may
be
formed
with
what
success
should
fortune
afford
an
opportunity
i
am
likely
to
treat
matters
of
greater
importance
for
although
some
things
should
be
made
our
principal
objects
whilst
others
ought
not
to
be
wholly
neglected
i
may
surely
be
allowed
to
exercise
the
powers
of
my
youth
as
yet
untaught
and
unexperienced
in
pursuits
of
this
latter
nature
lest
by
habit
i
should
feel
a
pleasure
in
indolence
and
in
sloth
the
parent
of
vice
i
have
therefore
employed
these
studies
as
a
kind
of
introduction
to
the
glorious
treasures
of
that
most
excellent
of
the
sciences
which
alone
deserves
the
name
of
science
which
alone
can
render
us
wise
to
rule
and
to
instruct
mankind
which
alone
the
other
sciences
follow
as
attendants
do
their
queen
laying
therefore
in
my
youth
the
foundations
of
so
noble
a
structure
it
is
my
intention
if
god
will
assist
me
and
prolong
my
life
to
reserve
my
maturer
years
for
composing
a
treatise
upon
so
perfect
so
sacred
a
subject
for
according
to
the
poet
quippe
fides
robustos
exigit
annos
important
concerns
of
faith
require
a
mind
in
its
full
vigour
i
may
be
permitted
to
indulge
myself
for
a
short
time
in
other
pursuits
but
in
this
i
should
wish
not
only
to
continue
but
to
die
but
before
i
enter
on
this
important
subject
i
demand
a
short
interval
to
enable
me
to
lay
before
the
public
my
treatise
on
the
instruction
of
a
prince
which
has
been
so
frequently
promised
as
well
as
the
description
of
wales
which
is
now
before
me
and
the
topography
of
britain
of
all
the
british
writers
gildas
alone
appears
to
me
as
often
as
the
course
of
my
subject
leads
me
to
consult
him
worthy
of
imitation
for
by
committing
to
paper
the
things
which
he
himself
saw
and
knew
and
by
declaring
rather
than
describing
the
desolation
of
his
country
he
has
compiled
a
history
more
remarkable
for
its
truth
than
for
its
elegance
giraldus
therefore
follows
gildas
whom
he
wishes
he
could
copy
in
his
life
and
manners
becoming
an
imitator
of
his
wisdom
rather
than
of
his
his
mind
rather
than
of
his
his
zeal
rather
than
of
his
his
life
rather
than
of
his
language
second
preface
to
the
same
when
amidst
various
literary
pursuits
i
first
applied
my
mind
to
the
compilation
of
history
i
determined
lest
i
should
appear
ungrateful
to
my
native
land
to
describe
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
my
own
country
and
its
adjoining
regions
and
afterwards
under
guidance
to
proceed
to
a
description
of
more
distant
territories
but
since
some
leading
men
whom
we
have
both
seen
and
known
show
so
great
a
contempt
for
literature
that
they
immediately
shut
up
within
their
the
excellent
works
with
which
they
are
presented
and
thus
doom
them
as
it
were
to
a
perpetual
imprisonment
i
entreat
you
illustrious
prelate
to
prevent
the
present
little
work
which
will
shortly
be
delivered
to
you
from
perishing
in
obscurity
and
because
this
as
well
as
my
former
productions
though
of
no
transcendent
merit
may
hereafter
prove
to
many
a
source
of
entertainment
and
instruction
i
entreat
you
generously
to
order
it
to
be
made
public
by
which
it
will
acquire
reputation
and
i
shall
consider
myself
sufficiently
rewarded
for
my
trouble
if
withdrawing
for
a
while
from
your
religious
and
secular
occupations
you
would
kindly
condescend
to
peruse
this
book
or
at
least
give
it
an
attentive
hearing
for
in
times
like
these
when
no
one
remunerates
literary
productions
i
neither
desire
nor
expect
any
other
recompense
not
that
it
would
appear
in
any
way
inconsistent
however
there
exists
among
men
of
rank
a
kind
of
conspiracy
against
authors
if
a
prelate
so
eminently
conspicuous
for
his
virtues
for
his
abilities
both
natural
and
acquired
for
irreproachable
morals
and
for
munificence
should
distinguish
himself
likewise
by
becoming
the
generous
and
sole
patron
of
literature
to
comprise
your
merits
in
a
few
words
the
lines
of
martial
addressed
to
trajan
whilst
serving
under
dioclesian
may
be
deservedly
applied
to
you
debes
quoniam
sub
principe
duro
temporibusque
malis
ausus
es
esse
and
those
also
of
virgil
to
mecænas
which
extol
the
humanity
of
that
great
man
cum
possis
tanto
tam
clarus
amico
te
sensit
nemo
posse
nocere
many
indeed
remonstrate
against
my
proceedings
and
those
particularly
who
call
themselves
my
friends
insist
that
in
consequence
of
my
violent
attachment
to
study
i
pay
no
attention
to
the
concerns
of
the
world
or
to
the
interests
of
my
family
and
that
on
this
account
i
shall
experience
a
delay
in
my
promotion
to
worldly
dignities
that
the
influence
of
authors
both
poets
and
historians
has
long
since
ceased
that
the
respect
paid
to
literature
vanished
with
literary
princes
and
that
in
these
degenerate
days
very
different
paths
lead
to
honours
and
opulence
i
allow
all
this
i
readily
allow
it
and
acquiesce
in
the
truth
for
the
unprincipled
and
covetous
attach
themselves
to
the
court
the
churchmen
to
their
books
and
the
ambitious
to
the
public
offices
but
as
every
man
is
under
the
influence
of
some
darling
passion
so
the
love
of
letters
and
the
study
of
eloquence
have
from
my
infancy
had
for
me
peculiar
charms
of
attraction
impelled
by
this
thirst
for
knowledge
i
have
carried
my
researches
into
the
mysterious
works
of
nature
farther
than
the
generality
of
my
contemporaries
and
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
have
rescued
from
oblivion
the
remarkable
events
of
my
own
times
but
this
object
was
not
to
be
secured
without
an
indefatigable
though
at
the
same
time
an
agreeable
exertion
for
an
accurate
investigation
of
every
particular
is
attended
with
much
difficulty
it
is
difficult
to
produce
an
orderly
account
of
the
investigation
and
discovery
of
truth
it
is
difficult
to
preserve
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
a
connected
relation
unbroken
by
irrelevant
matter
and
it
is
difficult
to
render
the
narration
no
less
elegant
in
the
diction
than
instructive
in
its
matter
for
in
prosecuting
the
series
of
events
the
choice
of
happy
expressions
is
equally
perplexing
as
the
search
after
them
painful
whatever
is
written
requires
the
most
intense
thought
and
every
expression
should
be
carefully
polished
before
it
be
submitted
to
the
public
eye
for
by
exposing
itself
to
the
examination
of
the
present
and
of
future
ages
it
must
necessarily
undergo
the
criticism
not
only
of
the
acute
but
also
of
the
dissatisfied
reader
words
merely
uttered
are
soon
forgotten
and
the
admiration
or
disgust
which
they
occasioned
is
no
more
but
writings
once
published
are
never
lost
and
remain
as
lasting
memorials
either
of
the
glory
or
of
the
disgrace
of
the
author
hence
the
observation
of
seneca
that
the
malicious
attention
of
the
envious
reader
dwells
with
no
less
satisfaction
on
a
faulty
than
on
an
elegant
expression
and
is
as
anxious
to
discover
what
it
may
ridicule
as
what
it
may
commend
as
the
poet
also
observes
enim
citius
meminitque
libentius
illud
quod
quis
deridet
quam
quod
probat
et
among
the
pursuits
therefore
most
worthy
of
commendation
this
holds
by
no
means
the
lowest
rank
for
history
as
the
moral
philosopher
declares
the
record
of
antiquity
the
testimony
of
ages
the
light
of
truth
the
soul
of
memory
the
mistress
of
conduct
and
the
herald
of
ancient
this
study
is
the
more
delightful
as
it
is
more
honourable
to
produce
works
worthy
of
being
quoted
than
to
quote
the
works
of
others
as
it
is
more
desirable
to
be
the
author
of
compositions
which
deserve
to
be
admired
than
to
be
esteemed
a
good
judge
of
the
writings
of
other
men
as
it
is
more
meritorious
to
be
the
just
object
of
other
commendations
than
to
be
considered
an
adept
in
pointing
out
the
merits
of
others
on
these
pleasing
reflections
i
feed
and
regale
myself
for
i
would
rather
resemble
jerome
than
croesus
and
i
prefer
to
riches
themselves
the
man
who
is
capable
of
despising
them
with
these
gratifying
ideas
i
rest
contented
and
delighted
valuing
moderation
more
than
intemperance
and
an
honourable
sufficiency
more
than
superfluity
for
intemperance
and
superfluity
produce
their
own
destruction
but
their
opposite
virtues
never
perish
the
former
vanish
but
the
latter
like
eternity
remain
for
ever

that

have
the

written
in

also
retain
them

to
sylvius
ascanius

from

spring
wales
is
divided
and
distinguished
by
noble
rivers
which
derive
their
source
from
two
ranges
of
mountains
the
ellennith
in

wales
which
the
english
call
moruge
as
being
the
heads
of

or
bogs
and
eryri
in
north
wales
which
they
call
snowdon
or
mountains
of

the
latter
of
which
are
said
to
be
of
so
great
an

also
here
remark

it

to
insert

how

artfully

concerning
the
pleasantness
and
fertility
of
wales
as
the
southern
part
of
wales
near
cardiganshire
but
particularly
pembrokeshire
is
much
pleasanter
on
account
of
its
plains
and
so
north
wales
is
better
defended
by
nature
is
more
productive
of
men
distinguished
for
bodily
strength
and
more
fertile
in
the
nature
of
its
soil
for
as
the
mountains
of
eryri
snowdon
could
supply
pasturage
for
all
the
herds
of
cattle
in
wales
if
collected
together
so
could
the
isle
of
mona
anglesey
provide
a
requisite
quantity
of
corn
for
all
the
inhabitants
on
which
account
there
is
an
old
british
proverb
mam
that
is
is
the
mother
of
merionyth
and
the
land
of
conan
is
the
rudest
and
least
cultivated
region
and
the
least
accessible
the
natives
of
that
part
of
wales
excel
in
the
use
of
long
lances
as
those
of
monmouthshire
are
distinguished
for
their
management
of
the
bow
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
british
language
is
more
delicate
and
richer
in
north
wales
that
country
being
less
intermixed
with
foreigners
many
however
assert
that
the
language
of
cardiganshire
in
south
wales
placed
as
it
were
in
the
middle
and
heart
of
cambria
is
the
most
refined
the
people
of
cornwall
and
the
armoricans
speak
a
language
similar
to
that
of
the
britons
and
from
its
origin
and
near
resemblance
it
is
intelligible
to
the
welsh
in
many
instances
and
almost
in
all
and
although
less
delicate
and
methodical
yet
it
approaches
as
i
judge
more
to
the
ancient
british
idiom
as
in
the
southern
parts
of
england
and
particularly
in
devonshire
the
english
language
seems
less
agreeable
yet
it
bears
more
marks
of
antiquity
the
northern
parts
being
much
corrupted
by
the
irruptions
of
the
danes
and
norwegians
and
adheres
more
strictly
to
the
original
language
and
ancient
mode
of
speaking
a
positive
proof
of
which
may
be
deduced
from
all
the
english
works
of
bede
rhabanus
and
king
alfred
being
written
according
to
this
idiom
chapter
vii
origin
of
the
names
cambria
and
wales
cambria
was
so
called
from
camber
son
of
brutus
for
brutus
descending
from
the
trojans
by
his
grandfather
ascanius
and
father
silvius
led
the
remnant
of
the
trojans
who
had
long
been
detained
in
greece
into
this
western
isle
and
having
reigned
many
years
and
given
his
name
to
the
country
and
people
at
his
death
divided
the
kingdom
of
wales
between
his
three
sons
to
his
eldest
son
locrinus
he
gave
that
part
of
the
island
which
lies
between
the
rivers
humber
and
severn
and
which
from
him
was
called
loegria
to
his
second
son
albanactus
he
gave
the
lands
beyond
the
humber
which
took
from
him
the
name
of
albania
but
to
his
youngest
son
camber
he
bequeathed
all
that
region
which
lies
beyond
the
severn
and
is
called
after
him
cambria
hence
the
country
is
properly
and
truly
called
cambria
and
its
inhabitants
cambrians
or
cambrenses
some
assert
that
their
name
was
derived
from
and
that
is
distorted
greek
on
account
of
the
affinity
of
their
languages
contracted
by
their
long
residence
in
greece
but
this
conjecture
though
plausible
is
not
well
founded
on
truth
the
name
of
wales
was
not
derived
from
wallo
a
general
or
wandolena
the
queen
as
the
fabulous
history
of
geoffrey
arthurius
falsely
maintains
because
neither
of
these
personages
are
to
be
found
amongst
the
welsh
but
it
arose
from
a
barbarian
appellation
the
saxons
when
they
seized
upon
britain
called
this
nation
as
they
did
all
foreigners
wallenses
and
thus
the
barbarous
name
remains
to
the
people
and
their
country
having
discoursed
upon
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
land
the
genealogies
of
the
princes
the
sources
of
the
rivers
and
the
derivation
of
the
names
of
this
country
we
shall
now
consider
the
nature
and
character
of
the
nation
chapter
viii
concerning
the
nature
manners
and
dress
the
boldness
agility
and
courage
of
this
nation
this
people
is
light
and
active
hardy
rather
than
strong
and
entirely
bred
up
to
the
use
of
arms
for
not
only
the
nobles
but
all
the
people
are
trained
to
war
and
when
the
trumpet
sounds
the
alarm
the
husbandman
rushes
as
eagerly
from
his
plough
as
the
courtier
from
his
court
for
here
it
is
not
found
that
as
in
other
places
labor
actus
in

returns
for
in
the

of

and

only

soil
is
once
ploughed
for
oats
and
again
in
the
summer
a
third
time
and
in
winter
for
wheat
almost
all
the
people
live
upon
the
produce
of
their
herds
with
oats
milk
cheese
and
butter
eating
flesh
in
larger
proportions
than
bread
they
pay
no
attention
to
commerce
shipping
or
manufactures
and
suffer
no
interruption
but
by
martial
exercises
they
anxiously
study
the
defence
of
their
country
and
their
liberty
for
these
they
fight
for
these
they
undergo
hardships
and
for
these
willingly
sacrifice
their
lives
they
esteem
it
a
disgrace
to
die
in
bed
an
honour
to
die
in
the
field
of
battle
using
the
expressions
hinc
avertite

nor
is
it
wonderful
if
it
degenerates
for
the
ancestors
of
these
men

æneadæ
rushed
to
arms
in
the
cause
of
liberty
it
is
remarkable
that
this
people
though
unarmed
dares
attack
an
armed
foe
the
infantry
defy
the
cavalry
and
by
their
activity

of

among

circumstances
mentioned
the
following
in
a
certain
part
of

there
was
a
people
called

so
bold
and
ferocious
that
when
unarmed
they
did
not
fear
to
encounter
an
armed
force
being
ready
to
shed
their
blood
in
defence
of
their
country
and
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
renown
which
is
the
more
surprising
as
the
beasts

field

the
whole
face
of

these
desperate
men
could
not

the
stags

minds
are
always
bent
upon
the
defence
of

are

accustomed

they
dedicate

partake
of

meal
and
even
if
they
have
none
or
only
a

scanty
one
they
patiently
wait
till

chapter
x
of
their
hospitality
and
liberality
no
one
of
this
nation
ever
begs
for
the
houses
of
all
are
common
to
all
and
they
consider
liberality
and
hospitality
amongst
the
first
virtues
so
much
does
hospitality
here
rejoice
in
communication
that
it
is
neither
offered
nor
requested
by
travellers
who
on
entering
any
house
only
deliver
up
their
arms
when
water
is
offered
to
them
if
they
suffer
their
feet
to
be
washed
they
are
received
as
guests
for
the
offer
of
water
to
wash
the
feet
is
with
this
nation
an
hospitable
invitation
but
if
they
refuse
the
proffered
service
they
only
wish
for
morning
refreshment
not
lodging
the
young
men
move
about
in
troops
and
families
under
the
direction
of
a
chosen
leader
attached
only
to
arms
and
ease
and
ever
ready
to
stand
forth
in
defence
of
their
country
they
have
free
admittance
into
every
house
as
if
it
were
their
own
those
who
arrive
in
the
morning
are
entertained
till
evening
with
the
conversation
of
young
women
and
the
music
of
the
harp
for
each
house
has
its
young
women
and
harps
allotted
to
this
purpose
two
circumstances
here
deserve
notice
that
as
no
nation
labours
more
under
the
vice
of
jealousy
than
the
irish
so
none
is
more
free
from
it
than
the
welsh
and
in
each
family
the
art
of
playing
on
the
harp
is
held
preferable
to
any
other
learning
in
the
evening
when
no
more
guests
are
expected
the
meal
is
prepared
according
to
the
number
and
dignity
of
the
persons
assembled
and
according
to
the
wealth
of
the
family
who
entertains
the
kitchen
does
not
supply
many
dishes
nor
incitements
to
eating
the
house
is
not
furnished
with
tables
cloths
or
napkins
they
study
nature
more
than
splendour
for
which
reason
the
guests
being
seated
in
threes
instead
of
couples
as
elsewhere
they
place
the
dishes
before
them
all
at
once
upon
rushes
and
fresh
grass
in
large
platters
or
trenchers
they
also
make
use
of
a
thin
and
broad
cake
of
bread
baked
every
day
such
as
in
old
writings
was
called
and
they
sometimes
add
chopped
meat
with
broth
such
a
repast
was
formerly
used
by
the
noble
youth
from
whom
this
nation
boasts
its
descent
and
whose
manners
it
still
partly
imitates
according
to
the
word
of
the
poet
mensas
consumimus
inquit
while
the
family
is
engaged
in
waiting
on
the
guests
the
host
and
hostess
stand
up
paying
unremitting
attention
to
everything
and
take
no
food
till
all
the
company
are
satisfied
that
in
case
of
any
deficiency
it
may
fall
upon
them
a
bed
made
of
rushes
and
covered
with
a
coarse
kind
of
cloth
manufactured
in
the
country
called
is
then
placed
along
the
side
of
the
room
and
they
all
in
common
lie
down
to
sleep
nor
is
their
dress
at
night
different
from
that
by
day
for
at
all
seasons
they
defend
themselves
from
the
cold
only
by
a
thin
cloak
and
tunic
the
fire
continues
to
burn
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
at
their
feet
and
they
receive
much
comfort
from
the
natural
heat
of
the
persons
lying
near
them
but
when
the
under
side
begins
to
be
tired
with
the
hardness
of
the
bed
or
the
upper
one
to
suffer
from
cold
they
immediately
leap
up
and
go
to
the
fire
which
soon
relieves
them
from
both
inconveniences
and
then
returning
to
their
couch
they
expose
alternately
their
sides
to
the
cold
and
to
the
hardness
of
the
bed
chapter
xi
concerning
their
cutting
of
their
hair
their
care
of
their
teeth
and
shaving
of
their
beard
the
men
and
women
cut
their
hair
close
round
to
the
ears
and
eyes
the
women
after
the
manner
of
the
parthians
cover
their
heads
with
a
large
white
veil
folded
together
in
the
form
of
a
crown
both
sexes
exceed
any
other
nation
in
attention
to
their
teeth
which
they
render
like
ivory
by
constantly
rubbing
them
with
green
hazel
and
wiping
with
a
woollen
cloth
for
their
better
preservation
they
abstain
from
hot
meats
and
eat
only
such
as
are
cold
warm
or
temperate
the
men
shave
all
their
beard
except
the
moustaches
this
custom
is
not
recent
but
was
observed
in
ancient
and
remote
ages
as
we
find
in
the
works
of
julius
cæsar
who
says
britons
shave
every
part
of
their
body
except
their
head
and
upper
lip
and
to
render
themselves
more
active
and
avoid
the
fate
of
absalon
in
their
excursions
through
the
woods
they
are
accustomed
to
cut
even
the
hair
from
their
heads
so
that
this
nation
more
than
any
other
shaves
off
all
pilosity
julius
also
adds
that
the
britons
previous
to
an
engagement
anointed
their
faces
with
a
nitrous
ointment
which
gave
them
so
ghastly
and
shining
an
appearance
that
the
enemy
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
them
particularly
if
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
reflected
on
them
chapter
xii
of
their
quickness
and
sharpness
of
understanding
these
people
being
of
a
sharp
and
acute
intellect
and
gifted
with
a
rich
and
powerful
understanding
excel
in
whatever
studies
they
pursue
and
are
more
quick
and
cunning
than
the
other
inhabitants
of
a
western
clime
their
musical
instruments
charm
and
delight
the
ear
with
their
sweetness
are
borne
along
by
such
celerity
and
delicacy
of
modulation
producing
such
a
consonance
from
the
rapidity
of
seemingly
discordant
touches
that
i
shall
briefly
repeat
what
is
set
forth
in
our
irish
topography
on
the
subject
of
the
musical
instruments
of
the
three
nations
it
is
astonishing
that
in
so
complex
and
rapid
a
movement
of
the
fingers
the
musical
proportions
can
be
preserved
and
that
throughout
the
difficult
modulations
on
their
various
instruments
the
harmony
is
completed
with
such
a
sweet
velocity
so
unequal
an
equality
so
discordant
a
concord
as
if
the
chords
sounded
together
fourths
or
fifths
they
always
begin
from
b
flat
and
return
to
the
same
that
the
whole
may
be
completed
under
the
sweetness
of
a
pleasing
sound
they
enter
into
a
movement
and
conclude
it
in
so
delicate
a
manner
and
play
the
little
notes
so
sportively
under
the
blunter
sounds
of
the
base
strings
enlivening
with
wanton
levity
or
communicating
a
deeper
internal
sensation
of
pleasure

those
who
have
skilfully
penetrated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
art
fatigue
rather
than
gratify
the
ears
of
others
who
seeing
do
not
perceive
and
hearing
do
not
understand
and
by
whom
the
finest
music
is
esteemed
no
better
than
a
confused
and
disorderly
noise
and
will
be
heard
with
unwillingness
and
disgust
they
make
use
of
three
instruments
the
harp
the
pipe
and
the
crwth
or
crowd
they
omit
no
part
of
natural
rhetoric

the
management
of
civil
actions
in
quickness
of
invention
disposition
refutation
and
confirmation
in
their
rhymed
songs
and
set
speeches
they
are
so
subtle
and
ingenious
that
they
produce
in
their
native
tongue
ornaments
of
wonderful
and
exquisite
invention
both
in
the
words
and
sentences
hence
arise
those
poets
whom
they
call
bards
of
whom
you
will
find
many
in
this
nation
endowed
with
the
above
faculty
according
to
the
observation
concreti
fuderunt
carmina
but
they
make
use
of
alliteration
in
preference
to
all
other
ornaments
of
rhetoric
and
that
particular
kind
which
joins
by
consonancy
the
first
letters
or
syllables
of
words
so
much
do
the
english
and
welsh
nations
employ
this
ornament
of
words
in
all
exquisite
composition
that
no
sentence
is
esteemed
to
be
elegantly
spoken
no
oration
to
be
otherwise
than
uncouth
and
unrefined
unless
it
be
fully
polished

the

tongue

this
ornament
occurs
not
in

we
know
so
frequently
as
in
the
two

it
is
indeed
surprising
that
the
french
in
other
respects
so
ornamented
should
be
entirely
ignorant
of
this
verbal
elegance
so
much
adopted
in
other
languages
nor
can
i
believe
that
the
english
and
welsh
so
different
and
adverse
to
each
other
could
designedly
have
agreed
in
the
usage
of
this
figure
but
i
should
rather
suppose
that
it
had
grown
habitual
to
both
by
long
custom
as
it
pleases
the
ear
by
a
transition
from
similar
to
similar
sounds

of

in

musical
concerts
they
do
not
sing
in

like
the
inhabitants
of

countries
but
in
many
different
parts
so
that
in
a
company
of
singers
which
one
very
frequently
meets
with
in
wales
you
will
hear
as
many
different
parts
and
voices
as
there
are
performers
who
all
at
length
unite
with
organic
melody
in
one
consonance

the
soft
sweetness
of

in
the
northern
district
of

beyond

with
less
variety

parts

murmuring
in

in

acute
or
treble
neither
of
the
two
nations
has
acquired
this
peculiarity
by
art
but
by
long
habit
which
has
rendered
it
natural
and
familiar
and
the
practice
is
now
so
firmly
rooted
in
them
that
it
is
unusual
to
hear
a
simple
and
single
melody
well
sung
and
what
is
still
more
wonderful
the
children
even
from
their
infancy
sing
in
the
same
manner
as
the
english
in
general
do
not
adopt
this
mode
of
singing
but
only
those
of
the
northern
countries
i
believe
that
it
was
from
the
danes
and
norwegians
by
whom
these
parts
of
the
island
were
more
frequently
invaded
and
held
longer
under

and
which
had

also
was
the
name
of
a
certain

with
whom
it
was
said
each

from

circumstance
arose

of

people
devoutly
entered
the
church

previous
to
an
intended
journey
the
oblations
having
been
made
and
mass
solemnised
a
young
man
came
to
him
in
the
church
and
publicly
declared
himself
to
be
his
son
threw
himself
at
his
feet
and
with
tears
humbly
requested
that
the
truth
of
this
assertion
might
be
ascertained
by
the
trial

the
burning

intelligence
of
this
circumstance
being
conveyed
to

and
his

sons
who

just
gone
out

a
youth
who
was
present
made
this
remark
is
not
wonderful
some
have
brought
gold
and
others
silver
as
offerings
but
this
man
who
had
neither
brought
what
he
had
namely
iron
thus
taunting
him
with
his
poverty
on
mentioning
a
certain
house
that
was
strongly
built
and
almost
impregnable
one
of
the
company
said
house
indeed
is
strong

it
could
never
be

alluding

to

to

fault
with

hostess
for
putting

little
butter
to

whereas
the
accessory
should
be
put
to

thus
by
a
subtle
transposition
of
the
words
converting
the
accessory
into
the
principal
by
making
it
appear
to
abound
in

in

and

even
in
the

the

it

still
retain
the
exterior
fairness
of

inseparable

which
their
confidence
is
derived

three
nations
remnants
of

fled
from

into

parts
of

the
romans
under
æneas
the

under

the
britons
under

from
thence
arose
that
courage
that
nobleness
of
mind
that
ancient
dignity
that
acuteness
of
understanding
and
confidence
of
speech
for
which
these
three
nations
are
so
highly
distinguished

the
britons
from
having
been
detained
longer
in

than
the
other
two
nations
after
the
destruction
of
their
country

concerning

whom
you
will
find
nowhere
else
called
awenddyon

when
consulted
upon
any
doubtful
event
they
roar
out
violently

rendered
beside
themselves
and
become
as
it
were
possessed
by
a
spirit
they
do
not
deliver
the
answer
to
what
is
required
in
a
connected
manner
but
the
person
who
skilfully
observes
them
will
find
after
many
preambles
and
many
nugatory
and
incoherent
though
ornamented
speeches
the
desired
explanation
conveyed
in
some
turn
of
a
word
they
are
then
roused
from
their
ecstasy
as
from
a
deep
sleep
and
as
it
were
by
violence
compelled
to
return
to
their
proper
senses
after
having
answered
the
questions
they
do
not
recover
till
violently
shaken
by
other
people
nor
can
they
remember
the
replies
they
have
given
if
consulted
a
second
or
third
time
upon
the
same
point
they
will
make
use
of
expressions
totally
different
perhaps
they
speak
by
the
means
of
fanatic
and
ignorant
spirits
these
gifts
are
usually
conferred
upon
them
in
dreams
some
seem
to
have
sweet
milk
or
honey
poured
on
their
lips
others
fancy
that
a
written
schedule
is
applied
to
their
mouths
and
on
awaking
they
publicly
declare
that
they
have
received
this
gift
such
is
the
saying
of
esdras
lord
said
unto
me
open
thy
mouth
and
i
opened
my
mouth
and
behold
a
cup
full
of
water

it

my
they
invoke
during
their
prophecies
the
true
and
living
god
and
the
holy
trinity
and
pray
that
they
may
not
by
their
sins
be
prevented
from
finding
the
truth
these
prophets
are
only
found
among
the
britons
descended
from
the
trojans
for
calchas
and
cassandra
endowed
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
openly
foretold
during
the
siege
of
troy
the
destruction
of
that
fine
city
on
which
account
the
high
priest
helenus
influenced
by
the
prophetic
books
of
calchas
and
of
others
who
had
long
before
predicted
the
ruin
of
their
country
in
the
first
year
went
over
to
the
greeks
with
the
sons
of
priam
to
whom
he
was
high
priest
and
was
afterwards
rewarded
in
greece
cassandra
daughter
of
king
priam
every
day
foretold
the
overthrow
of
the
city
but
the
pride
and
presumption
of
the
trojans
prevented
them
from
believing
her
word
even
on
the
very
night
that
the
city
was
betrayed
she
clearly
described
the
treachery
and
the
method
of
it
tales
casus
cassandra
canebat
as
in
the
same
manner
during
the
existence
of
the
kingdom
of
the
britons
both
merlin
caledonius
and
ambrosius
are
said
to
have
foretold
the
destruction
of
their
nation
as
well
as
the
coming
of
the
saxons
and
afterwards
that
of
the
normans
and
i
think
a
circumstance
related
by
aulus
gellius
worth
inserting
in
this
place
on
the
day
that
caius
cæsar
and
cneius
pompey
during
the
civil
war
fought
a
pitched
battle
in
thessalia
a
memorable
event
occurred
in
that
part
of
italy
situated
beyond
the
river
po
a
priest
named
cornelius
honourable
from
his
rank
venerable
for
his
religion
and
holy
in
his
manners
in
an
inspired
moment
proclaimed
has
conquered
and
named
the
day
the
events
the
mutual
attack
and
the
conflicts
of
the
two
armies
whether
such
things
are
exhibited
by
the
spirit
let
the
reader
more
particularly
inquire
i
do
not
assert
they
are
the
acts
of
a
pythonic
or
a
diabolic
spirit
for
as
foreknowledge
is
the
property
of
god
alone
so
is
it
in
his
power
to
confer
knowledge
of
future
events
there
are
differences
of
gifts
says
the
apostle
but
one
and
the
same
spirit
whence
peter
in
his
second
epistle
writes
the
prophecy
came
not
in
the
old
time
by
the
will
of
man
but
men
spake
as
if
they
were
inspired
by
the
holy
ghost
to
the
same
effect
did
the
chaldeans
answer
king
nebuchadonazar
on
the
interpretation
of
his
dream
which
he
wished
to
extort
from
them
is
not
say
they
man
upon
earth
who
can
o
king
satisfactorily
answer
your
question
let
no
king
therefore
however
great
or
potent
make
a
similar
request
to
any
magician
astrologer
or
chaldean
for
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth
and
there
is
none
other
that
can
shew
it
before
the
king
except
the
gods
whose
dwelling
is
not
with
on
this
passage
jerome
remarks
diviners
and
all
the
learned
of
this
world
confess
that
the
prescience
of
future
events
belongs
to
god
alone
the
prophets
therefore
who
foretold
things
to
come
spake
by
the
spirit
of
god
hence
some
persons
object
that
if
they
were
under
the
guidance
of
the
holy
spirit
they
would
sometimes
premise
saith
the
lord
god
or
make
use
of
some
expression
in
the
prophetic
style
and
as
such
a
mode
of
prophesying
is
not
taken
notice
of
by
merlin
and
no
mention
is
made
of
his
sanctity
devotion
or
faith
many
think
that
he
spake
by
a
pythonic
spirit
to
which
i
answer
that
the
spirit
of
prophecy
was
given
not
only
to
the
holy
but
sometimes
to
unbelievers
and
gentiles
to
baal
to
the
sibyls
and
even
to
bad
people
as
to
caiaphas
and
bela
on
which
occasion
origen
says
not
wonder
if
he
whom
ye
have
mentioned
declares
that
the
scribes
and
pharisees
and
doctors
amongst
the
jews
prophesied
concerning
christ
for
caiaphas
said
is
expedient
for
us
that
one
man
die
for
the
people
but
asserts
at
the
same
time
that
because
he
was
high
priest
for
that
year
he
prophesied
let
no
man
therefore
be
lifted
up
if
he
prophesies
if
he
merits
prescience
for
prophecies
shall
fail
tongues
shall
cease
knowledge
shall
vanish
away
and
now
abideth
faith
hope
and
charity
these
three
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
which
never
faileth
but
these
bad
men
not
only
prophesied
but
sometimes
performed
great
miracles
which
others
could
not
accomplish
john
the
baptist
who
was
so
great
a
personage
performed
no
miracle
as
john
the
evangelist
testifies
many
came
to
jesus
and
said
because
john
wrought
no
signs
etc
nor
do
we
hear
that
the
mother
of
god
performed
any
miracle
we
read
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
that
the
sons
of
sheva
cast
out
devils
in
the
name
of
jesus
whom
paul
preached
and
in
matthew
and
luke
we
may
find
these
words
shall
say
unto
me
in
that
day
lord
lord
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works
and
then
i
will
profess
unto
them
i
never
knew
and
in
another
place
john
says
we
saw
a
certain
man
casting
out
devils
in
thy
name
and
forbade
him
because
he
followeth
not
with
but
jesus
said
him
not
no
man
can
do
a
miracle
in
my
name
and
speak
evil
of
me
for
whoever
is
not
against
me
is
for
alexander
of
macedon
a
gentile
traversed
the
caspian
mountains
and
miraculously
confined
ten
tribes
within
their
promontories
where
they
still
remain
and
will
continue
until
the
coming
of
elias
and
enoch
we
read
indeed
the
prophecies
of
merlin
but
hear
nothing
either
of
his
sanctity
or
his
miracles
some
say
that
the
prophets
when
they
prophesied
did
not
become
frantic
as
it
is
affirmed
of
merlin
silvestris
and
others
possessed
whom
we
have
before
mentioned
some
prophesied
by
dreams
visions
and
enigmatical
sayings
as
ezechiel
and
daniel
others
by
acts
and
words
as
noah
in
the
construction
of
the
ark
alluded
to
the
church
abraham
in
the
slaying
of
his
son
to
the
passion
of
christ
and
moses
by
his
speech
when
he
said
prophet
shall
the
lord
god
raise
up
to
you
of
your
brethren
hear
him
meaning
christ
others
have
prophesied
in
a
more
excellent
way
by
the
internal
revelation
and
inspiration
of
the
holy
spirit
as
david
did
when
persecuted
by
saul
saul
heard
that
david
had
fled
to
naioth
which
is
a
hill
in
ramah
and
the
seat
of
the
prophets
he
sent
messengers
to
take
him
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
prophesying
and
samuel
standing
at
their
head
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
the
messengers
of
saul
and
they
also
prophesied
and
he
sent
messengers
a
second
and
again
a
third
time
and
they
also
prophesied
and
saul
enraged
went
thither
also
and
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
him
also
and
he
went
on
and
prophesied
until
he
came
to
naioth
and
he
stripped
off
his
royal
vestments
and
prophesied
with
the
rest
for
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
whilst
david
and
samuel
secretly
observed
what
nor
is
it
wonderful
that
those
persons
who
suddenly
receive
the
spirit
of
god
and
so
signal
a
mark
of
grace
should
for
a
time
seem
alienated
from
their
earthly
state
of
mind
chapter
xvii
their
love
of
high
birth
and
ancient
genealogy
the
welsh
esteem
noble
birth
and
generous
descent
above
all
things
and
are
therefore
more
desirous
of
marrying
into
noble
than
rich
families
even
the
common
people
retain
their
genealogy
and
can
not
only
readily
recount
the
names
of
their
grandfathers
and
but
even
refer
back
to
the
sixth
or
seventh
generation
or
beyond
them
in
this
manner
rhys

of
gruffydd

of

of
tewdwr
son
of
eineon
son
of

son
of
howel
son
of
cadell
son
of
roderic
mawr
and
so
on
being
particularly
attached
to
family
descent
they
revenge
with
vehemence
the
injuries
which
may
tend
to
the
disgrace
of
their
blood
and
being
naturally
of
a
vindictive
and
passionate
disposition
they
are
ever
ready
to
avenge
not
only
recent
but
ancient
affronts
they
neither
inhabit
towns
villages
nor
castles
but
lead
a
solitary
life
in
the
woods
on
the
borders
of
which
they
do
not
erect
sumptuous
palaces
nor
lofty
stone
buildings
but
content
themselves
with
small
huts
made
of
the
boughs
of
trees
twisted
together
constructed
with
little
labour
and
expense
and
sufficient
to
endure
throughout
the
year
they
have
neither
orchards
nor
gardens
but
gladly
eat
the
fruit
of
both
when
given
to
them
the
greater
part
of
their
land
is
laid
down
to
pasturage
little
is
cultivated
a
very
small
quantity
is
ornamented
with
flowers
and
a
still
smaller
is
sown
they
seldom
yoke
less
than
four
oxen
to
their
ploughs
the
driver
walks
before
but
backwards
and
when
he
falls
down

frequently
exposed
to
danger
from
the
refractory
oxen
instead
of

make
use
of
a
piece
of
iron
formed
like
a
knife
with
two
pieces
of
wood
fixed
loosely
and
flexibly
to
the
head
which
they
think
a
more
expeditious
instrument
but
since
irritant

subjecta
fidelibus
their
mode
of
using
it
will
be
better
known
by
inspection
than
by
any
description
the
boats
which
they
employ
in
fishing
or
in
crossing
the
rivers
are
made
of
twigs
not
oblong
nor
pointed
but
almost
round
or
rather
triangular
covered
both
within
and
without
with
raw
hides
when
a
salmon
thrown
into
one
of
these
boats
strikes
it
hard
with
his
tail
he
often
oversets
it
and
endangers
both
the
vessel
and
its
navigator
the
fishermen
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
in
going
to
and
from
the
rivers
carry
these
boats
on
their
shoulders
on
which
occasion
that
famous
dealer
in
fables
bleddercus
who
lived
a
little
before
our
time
thus
mysteriously
said
is
amongst
us
a
people
who
when
they
go
out
in
search
of
prey
carry
their
horses
on
their
backs
to
the
place
of
plunder
in
order
to
catch
their
prey
they
leap
upon
their
horses
and
when
it
is
taken
carry
their
horses
home
again
upon
their
chapter
xviii
of
the
antiquity
of
their
faith
their
love
of
christianity
and
devotion
in
ancient
times
and
about
two
hundred
years
before
the
overthrow
of
britain
the
welsh
were
instructed
and
confirmed
in
the
faith
by
faganus
and
damianus
sent
into
the
island
at
the
request
of
king
lucius
by
pope
eleutherius
and
from
that
period
when
germanus
of
auxerre
and
lupus
of
troyes
came
over
on
account
of
the
corruption
which
had
crept
into
the
island
by
the
invasion
of
the
saxons
but
particularly
with
a
view
of
expelling
the
pelagian
heresy
nothing
heretical
or
contrary
to
the
true
faith
was
to
be
found
amongst
the
natives
but
it
is
said
that
some
parts
of
the
ardent
doctrines
are

the

of

they
prefer

they
pay
the
most
fervent
adoration
to
the

we
observe
that
they
show
a
greater
respect
than
other

to

persons
to
the

of
saints

holy

the

which
they
devoutly
revere

hence
their

at

certain

have
been
appointed
by
the
bishops
in

to
maintain
the
security
of
the

the

extend
their
protection
to

far
as
they
can
go

any

has

preface
having
in
the
former
book
clearly
set
forth
the
character
manners
and
customs
of
the
british
nation
and
having
collected
and
explained
everything
which
could
redound
to
its
credit
or
glory
an
attention
to
order
now
requires
that
in
this
second
part
we
should
employ
our
pen
in
pointing
out
those
particulars
in
which
it
seems
to
transgress
the
line
of
virtue
and
commendation
having
first
obtained
leave
to
speak
the
truth
without
which
history
not
only
loses
its
authority
but
becomes
undeserving
of
its
very
name
for
the
painter
who
professes
to
imitate
nature
loses
his
reputation
if
by
indulging
his
fancy
he
represents
only
those
parts
of
the
subject
which
best
suit
him
since
therefore
no
man
is
born
without
faults
and
he
is
esteemed
the
best
whose
errors
are
the
least
let
the
wise
man
consider
everything
human
as
connected
with
himself
for
in
worldly
affairs
there
is
no
perfect
happiness
under
heaven
evil
borders
upon
good
and
vices
are
confounded
with
virtues
as
the
report
of
good
qualities
is
delightful
to
a
mind
so
the
relation
of
the
contrary
should
not
be
offensive
the
natural
disposition
of
this
nation
might
have
been
corrupted
and
perverted
by
long
exile
and
poverty
for
as
poverty
extinguisheth
many
faults
so
it
often
generates
failings
that
are
contrary
to
virtue
chapter
i
of
the
inconstancy
and
instability
of
this
nation
and
their
want
of
reverence
for
good
faith
and
oaths
these
people
are
no
less
light
in
mind
than
in
body
and
are
by
no
means
to
be
relied
upon
they
are
easily
urged
to
undertake
any
action
and
are
as
easily
checked
from
prosecuting
people
quick
in
action
but
more
stubborn
in
a
bad
than
in
a
good
cause
and
constant
only
in
acts
of
inconstancy
they
pay
no
respect
to
oaths
faith
or
truth
and
so
lightly
do
they
esteem
the
covenant
of
faith
held
so
inviolable
by
other
nations
that
it
is
usual
to
sacrifice
their
faith
for
nothing
by
holding
forth
the
right
hand
not
only
in
serious
and
important
concerns
but
even
on
every
trifling
occasion
and
for
the
confirmation
of
almost
every
common
assertion
they
never
scruple
at
taking
a
false
oath
for
the
sake
of
any
temporary
emolument
or
advantage
so
that
in
civil
and
ecclesiastical
causes
each
party
being
ready
to
swear
whatever
seems
expedient
to
its
purpose
endeavours
both
to
prove
and
defend
although
the
venerable
laws
by
which
oaths
are
deemed
sacred
and
truth
is
honoured
and
respected
by
favouring
the
accused
and
throwing
an
odium
upon
the
accuser
impose
the
burden
of
bringing
proofs
upon
the
latter
but
to
a
people
so
cunning
and
crafty
this
yoke
is
pleasant
and
this
burden
is
light
chapter
ii
their
living
by
plunder
and
disregard
of
the
bonds
of
peace
and
friendship
this
nation
conceives
it
right
to
commit
acts
of
plunder
theft
and
robbery
not
only
against
foreigners
and
hostile
nations
but
even
against
their
own
countrymen
when
an
opportunity
of
attacking
the
enemy
with
advantage
occurs
they
respect
not
the
leagues
of
peace
and
friendship
preferring
base
lucre
to
the
solemn
obligations
of
oaths
and
good
faith
to
which
circumstance
gildas
alludes
in
his
book
concerning
the
overthrow
of
the
britons
actuated
by
the
love
of
truth
and
according
to
the
rules
of
history
not
suppressing
the
vices
of
his
countrymen
are
neither
brave
in
war
nor
faithful
in
but
when
julius
cæsar
great
as
the
world
itself
quæsitis
ostendit
terga
britannis
were
they
not
brave
under
their
leader
cassivellaunus
and
when
belinus
and
brennus
added
the
roman
empire
to
their
conquests
what
were
they
in
the
time
of
constantine
son
of
our
helen
what
in
the
reign
of
aurelius
ambrosius
whom
even
eutropius
commends
what
were
they
in
the
time
of
our
famous
prince
arthur
i
will
not
say
fabulous
on
the
contrary
they
who
were
almost
subdued
by
the
scots
and
picts
often
harassed
with
success
the
auxiliary
roman
legions
and
exclaimed
as
we
learn
from
gildas
barbarians
drove
us
to
the
sea
the
sea
drove
us
again
back
to
the
barbarians
on
one
side
we
were
subdued
on
the
other
drowned
and
here
we
were
put
to
death
were
they
not
says
he
that
time
brave
and
praiseworthy
when
attacked
and
conquered
by
the
saxons
who
originally
had
been
called
in
as
stipendiaries
to
their
assistance
were
they
not
brave
but
the
strongest
argument
made
use
of
by
those
who
accuse
this
nation
of
cowardice
is
that
gildas
a
holy
man
and
a
briton
by
birth
has
handed
down
to
posterity
nothing
remarkable
concerning
them
in
any
of
his
historical
works
we
promise
however
a
solution
of
the
contrary
in
our
british
topography
if
god
grants
us
a
continuance
of
life
as
a
further
proof
it
may
be
necessary
to
add
that
from
the
time
when
that
illustrious
prince
of
the
britons
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
totally
exhausted
the
strength
of
the
country
by
transporting
the
whole
armed
force
beyond
the
seas
that
island
which
had
before
been
so
highly
illustrious
for
its
incomparable
valour
remained
for
many
subsequent
years
destitute
of
men
and
arms
and
exposed
to
the
predatory
attacks
of
pirates
and
robbers
so
distinguished
indeed
were
the
natives
of
this
island
for
their
bravery
that
by
their
prowess
that
king
subdued
almost
all
cisalpine
gaul
and
dared
even
to
make
an
attack
on
the
roman
empire
in
process
of
time
the
britons
recovering
their
population
and
knowledge
of
the
use
of
arms
their
high
and
ancient
character
let
the
different
æras
be
therefore
marked
and
the
historical
accounts
will
accord
with
regard
to
gildas
who
inveighs
so
bitterly
against
his
own
nation
the
britons
affirm
that
highly
irritated
at
the
death
of
his
brother
the
prince
of
albania
whom
king
arthur
had
slain
he
wrote
these
invectives
and
upon
the
same
occasion
threw
into
the
sea
many
excellent
books
in
which
he
had
described
the
actions
of
arthur
and
the
celebrated
deeds
of
his
countrymen
from
which
cause
it
arises
that
no
authentic
account
of
so
great
a
prince
is
any
where
to
be
found
chapter
iii
of
their
deficiency
in
battle
and
base
and
dishonourable
flight
in
war
this
nation
is
very
severe
in
the
first
attack
terrible
by
their
clamour
and
looks
filling
the
air
with
horrid
shouts
and
the
clangour
of
very
long
trumpets
swift
and
rapid
in
their
advances
and
frequent
throwing
of
darts
bold
in
the
first
onset
they
can
not
bear
a
repulse
being
easily
thrown
into
confusion
as
soon
as
they
turn
their
backs
and
they
trust
to
flight
for
safety
without
attempting
to
rally
which
the
poet
thought
reprehensible
in
martial
conflicts
scelus

tantum

and
vitium

the
character
given
to
the
teutones
in
the
roman
history
may
be
applied
to
this
people
their
first
attack
they
are
more
than
men
in
the
second
less
than
their
courage
manifests
itself
chiefly
in
the
retreat
when
they
frequently
return
and
like
the
parthians
shoot
their
arrows
behind
them
and
as
after
success
and
victory
in
battle
even
cowards
boast
of
their
courage
so
after
a
reverse
of
fortune
even
the
bravest
men
are
not
allowed
their
due
claims
of
merit
their
mode
of
fighting
consists
in
chasing
the
enemy
or
in
retreating
this
people
relying
more
on
their
activity
than
on
their
strength
can
not
struggle
for
the
field
of
battle
enter
into
close
engagement
or
endure
long
and
severe
actions
such
as
the
poet
describes
clypeo

umbone
repellitur

ense
minax
ensis
pede
pes
et
cuspide
though
defeated
and
put
to
flight
on
one
day
they
are
ready
to
resume
the
combat
on
the
next
neither
dejected
by
their
loss
nor
by
their
dishonour
and
although
perhaps
they
do
not
display
great
fortitude
in
open
engagements
and
regular
conflicts
yet
they
harass
the
enemy
by
ambuscades
and
nightly
sallies
hence
neither
oppressed
by
hunger
or
cold
nor
fatigued
by
martial
labours
nor
despondent
in
adversity
but
ready
after
a
defeat
to
return
immediately
to
action
and
again
endure
the
dangers
of
war
they
are
as
easy
to
overcome
in
a
single
battle
as
difficult
to
subdue
in
a
protracted
war

this

to
the
digging
up
of
boundary
ditches
removing
the
limits
transgressing
landmarks
and
extending
their
territory
by
every
possible
means
so
great
is
their
disposition
towards
this
common
violence
that
they
scruple
not
to
claim
as
their
hereditary
right
those
lands
which
are
held
under

or
at

on

endeavours

to
exalt
his

his

from
which
cause
great
disturbances
have
frequently
arisen
amongst

terminated
in
the
most
cruel

unjust

are
found
to
be
more
sincere
between
than
between
those
who
are
connected
by
the
natural
ties

it
is
also
remarkable
that
brothers
shew
more
affection
to
one
another
when
dead
than
when
living

they
persecute
the

with

in

their
abstinence
and
parsimony
are
too
severe
so
when
seated
at
another
table
after
a
long
fasting
like
wolves
and
eagles
who
like
them
live
by
plunder
and
are
rarely
satisfied
their
appetite
is
immoderate
they
are
therefore
penurious
in
times
of
scarcity
and
extravagant
in
times
of
plenty
but
no
man
as
in
england
mortgages
his

gratification
of

wish
however
that

chapter

concerning
the
crime
of
incest
and
the
abuse
of

by
succession
and
participation
the
crime
of
incest
hath
so
much
prevailed
not
only
among
the
higher
but
among
the
lower
orders
of
this
people
that
not
having
the
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
they
are
not
ashamed
of
intermarrying
with
their
relations
even
in
the
third
degree
of
consanguinity
they
generally
abuse
these
dispensations
with
a
view
of
appeasing
those
enmities
which
so
often
subsist
between
them
because
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
and
from
their
love
of
high
descent
which
they
so
ardently
affect
and
covet
they
unite
themselves
to
their
own
people
refusing
to
intermarry
with
strangers
and
arrogantly
presuming
on
their
own
superiority
of
blood
and
family
they
do
not
engage
in
marriage
until
they
have
tried
by
previous
cohabitation
the
disposition
and
particularly
the
fecundity
of
the
person
with
whom
they
are
engaged
an
ancient
custom
also
prevails
of
hiring
girls
from
their
parents
at
a
certain
price
and
a
stipulated
penalty
in
case
of
relinquishing
their
connection
their
churches
have
almost
as
many
parsons
and
sharers
as
there
are
principal
men
in
the
parish
the
sons
after
the
decease
of
their
fathers
succeed
to
the
ecclesiastical
benefices
not
by
election
but
by
hereditary
right
possessing
and
polluting
the
sanctuary
of
god
and
if
a
prelate
should
by
chance
presume
to
appoint
or
institute
any
other
person
the
people
would
certainly
revenge
the
injury
upon
the
institutor

instituted

these
two
excesses
of

which
took

summoned
with
a
view
of
putting
an
end
to

it

empire
heard
a
voice
saying
thou
go
to
rebuild
sodom
upon
which
he
altered
his
intention
turned
his
ships
and
standards
towards
byzantium
and
there
fixing
his
seat
of
empire
gave
his
own
propitious
name
to
the
city
the
british
history
informs
us
that
mailgon
king
of
the
britons
and
many
others
were
addicted
to
this
vice
that
enormity
however
had
entirely
ceased
for
so
long
a
time
that
the
recollection
of
it
was
nearly
worn
out
but
since
that
as
if
the
time
of
repentance
was
almost
expired
and
because
the
nation
by
its
warlike
successes
and
acquisition
of
territory
has
in
our
times
unusually
increased
in
population
and
strength
they
boast
in
their
turn
and
most
confidently
and
unanimously
affirm
that
in
a
short
time
their
countrymen
shall
return
to
the
island
and
according
to
the
prophecies
of
merlin
the
nation
and
even
the
name
of
foreigners
shall
be
extinguished
in
the
island
and
the
britons
shall
exult
again
in
their
ancient
name
and
privileges
but
to
me
it
appears
far
otherwise
for
since
animi
rebus
plerumque
secundis
nec
facile
est
æqua
commoda
mente
pati
and
because
habet
unde
suum
paupertas
pascat
amorem
divitiis
alitur
luxuriosus
so
that
their
abstinence
from
that
vice
which
in
their
prosperity
they
could
not
resist
may
be
attributed
more
justly
to
their
poverty
and
state
of
exile
than
to
their
sense
of
virtue
for
they
can
not
be
said
to
have
repented
when
we
see
them
involved
in
such
an
abyss
of
vices
perjury
theft
robbery
rapine
murders
fratricides
adultery
and
incest
and
become
every
day
more
entangled
and
ensnared
in
so
that
the
words
of
the
prophet
hosea
may
be
truly
applied
to
them
is
no
truth
nor
mercy
etc
other
matters
of
which
they
boast
are
more
properly
to
be
attributed
to
the
diligence
and
activity
of
the
norman
kings
than
to
their
own
merits
or
power
for
previous
to
the
coming
of
the
normans
when
the
english
kings
contented
themselves
with
the
sovereignty
of
britain
alone
and
employed
their
whole
military
force
in
the
subjugation
of
this
people
they
almost
wholly
extirpated
them
as
did
king
offa
who
by
a
long
and
extensive
dyke
separated
the
british
from
the
english
ethelfrid
also
who
demolished
the
noble
city
of
legions
and
put
to
death
the
monks
of
the
celebrated
monastery
at
banchor
who
had
been
called
in
to
promote
the
success
of
the
britons
by
their
prayers
and
lastly
harold
who
himself
on
foot
with
an
army
of
infantry
and
conforming
to
the
customary
diet
of
the
country
so
bravely
penetrated
through
every
part
of
wales
that
he
scarcely
left
a
man
alive
in
it
and
as
a
memorial
of
his
signal
victories
many
stones
may
be
found
in
wales
bearing
this
inscription
victor
fuit
harold
to
these
bloody
and
recent
victories
of
the
english
may
be
attributed
the
peaceable
state
of
wales
during
the
reigns
of
the
three
first
norman
kings
when
the
nation
increased
in
population
and
being
taught
the
use
of
arms
and
the
management
of
horses
by
the
english
and
normans
with
whom
they
had
much
intercourse
by
following
the
court
or
by
being
sent
as
hostages
took
advantage
of
the
necessary
attention
which
the
three
succeeding
kings
were
obliged
to
pay
to
their
foreign
possessions
and
once
more
lifting
up
their
crests
recovered
their
lands
and
spurned
the
yoke
that
had
formerly
been
imposed
upon
them
chapter
viii
in
what
manner
this
nation
is
to
be
overcome
the
prince
who
would
wish
to
subdue
this
nation
and
govern
it
peaceably
must
use
this
method
he
must
be
determined
to
apply
a
diligent
and
constant
attention
to
this
purpose
for
one
year
at
least
for
a
people
who
with
a
collected
force
will
not
openly
attack
the
enemy
in
the
field
nor
wait
to
be
besieged
in
castles
is
not
to
be
overcome
at
the
first
onset
but
to
be
worn
out
by
prudent
delay
and
patience
let
him
divide
their
strength
and
by
bribes
and
promises
endeavour
to
stir
up
one
against
the
other
knowing
the
spirit
of
hatred
and
envy
which
generally
prevails
amongst
them
and
in
the
autumn
let
not
only
the
marches
but
also
the
interior
part
of
the
country
be
strongly
fortified
with
castles
provisions
and
confidential
families
in
the
meantime
the
purchase
of
corn
cloth
and
salt
with
which
they
are
usually
supplied
from
england
should
be
strictly
interdicted
and
ships
placed
as
a
guard
on
the
coast
to
prevent
their
importation
of
these
articles
from
ireland
or
the
severn
sea
and
to
facilitate
the
supply
of
his
own
army
afterwards
when
the
severity
of
winter
approaches
when
the
trees
are
void
of
leaves
and
the
mountains
no
longer
afford
they
are
deprived
of
any
hopes
of
plunder
and
harassed
on
every
side
by
the
repeated
attacks
of
the
a
body
of
infantry
penetrate
into
their
woody
and
mountainous
retreats
and
let
these
troops
be
supported
and
relieved
by
others
and
thus
by
frequent
changes
and
replacing
the
men
who
are
either
fatigued
or
slain
in
battle
this
nation
may
be
ultimately
subdued
nor
can
it
be
overcome
without
the
above
precautions
nor
without
great
danger
and
loss
of
men
though
many
of
the
english
hired
troops
may
perish
in
a
day
of
battle
money
will
procure
as
many
or
more
on
the
morrow
for
the
same
service
but
to
the
welsh
who
have
neither
foreign
nor
stipendiary
troops
the
loss
is
for
the
time
irreparable
in
these
matters
therefore
as
an
artificer
is
to
be
trusted
in
his
trade
so
attention
is
to
be
paid
to
the
counsel
of
those
who
having
been
long
conversant
in
similar
concerns
are
become
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
country
and
whom
it
greatly
interests
that
an
enemy
for
whom
during
long
and
frequent
conflicts
they
have
contracted
an
implacable
hatred
should
by
their
assistance
be
either
weakened
or
destroyed
happy
should
i
have
termed
the
borders
of
wales
inhabited
by
the
english
if
their
kings
in
the
government
of
these
parts
and
in
their
military
operations
against
the
enemy
had
rather
employed
the
marchers
and
barons
of
the
country
than
adopted
the
counsels
and
policy
of
the
people
of
anjou
and
the
normans
in
this
as
well
as
in
every
other
military
expedition
either
in
ireland
or
in
wales
the
natives
of
the
marches
from
the
constant
state
of
warfare
in
which
they
are
engaged
and
whose
manners
are
formed
from
the
habits
of
war
are
bold
and
active
skilful
on
horseback
quick
on
foot
not
nice
as
to
their
diet
and
ever
prepared
when
necessity
requires
to
abstain
both
from
corn
and
wine
by
such
men
were
the
first
hostile
attacks
made
upon
wales
as
well
as
ireland
and
by
such
men
alone
can
their
final
conquest
be
accomplished
for
the
flemings
normans
coterells
and
bragmans
are
good
and
soldiers
in
their
own
country
but
the
gallic
soldiery
is
known
to
differ
much
from
the
welsh
and
irish
in
their
country
the
battle
is
on
level
here
on
rough
ground
there
in
an
open
field
here
in
forests
there
they
consider
their
armour
as
an
honour
here
as
a
burden
there
soldiers
are
taken
prisoners
here
they
are
beheaded
there
they
are
ransomed
here
they
are
put
to
death
where
therefore
the
armies
engage
in
a
flat
country
a
heavy
and
complex
armour
made
of
cloth
and
iron
both
protects
and
decorates
the
soldier
but
when
the
engagement
is
in
narrow
defiles
in
woods
or
marshes
where
the
infantry
have
the
advantage
over
the
cavalry
a
light
armour
is
preferable
for
light
arms
afford
sufficient
protection
against
unarmed
men
by
whom
victory
is
either
lost
or
won
at
the
first
onset
where
it
is
necessary
that
an
active
and
retreating
enemy
should
be
overcome
by
a
certain
proportional
quantity
of
moderate
armour
whereas
with
a
more
complex
sort
and
with
high
and
curved
saddles
it
is
difficult
to
dismount
more
so
to
mount
and
with
the
greatest
difficulty
can
such
troops
march
if
required
with
the
infantry
in
order
therefore
that
quæque
locum
teneant
sortita
decenter
we
maintain
it
is
necessary
to
employ
and
strong
troops
against
men
heavily
armed
depending
entirely
upon
their
natural
strength
and
accustomed
to
fight
in
an
open
plain
but
against
and
active
troops
who
prefer
rough
ground
men
accustomed
to
such
conflicts
and
armed
in
a
similar
manner
must
be
employed
but
let
the
cities
and
fortresses
on
the
severn
and
the
whole
territory
on
its
western
banks
towards
wales
occupied
by
the
english
as
well
as
the
provinces
of
shropshire
and
cheshire
which
are
protected
by
powerful
armies
or
by
any
other
special
privileges
and
honourable
independence
rejoice
in
the
provident
bounty
of
their
prince
there
should
be
a
yearly
examination
of
the
warlike
stores
of
the
arms
and
horses
by
good
and
discreet
men
deputed
for
that
purpose
and
who
not
intent
on
its
plunder
and
ruin
interest
themselves
in
the
defence
and
protection
of
their
country
by
these
salutary
measures
the
soldiers
citizens
and
the
whole
mass
of
the
people
being
instructed
and
accustomed
to
the
use
of
arms
liberty
may
be
opposed
by
liberty
and
pride
be
checked
by
pride
for
the
welsh
who
are
neither
worn
out
by
laborious
burdens
nor
molested
by
the
exactions
of
their
lords
are
ever
prompt
to
avenge
an
injury
hence
arise
their
distinguished
bravery
in
the
defence
of
their
country
hence
their
readiness
to
take
up
arms
and
to
rebel
nothing
so
much
excites
encourages
and
invites
the
hearts
of
men
to
probity
as
the
cheerfulness
of
liberty
nothing
so
much
dejects
and
dispirits
them
as
the
oppression
of
servitude
this
portion
of
the
kingdom
protected
by
arms
and
courage
might
be
of
great
use
to
the
prince
not
only
in
these
or
the
adjacent
parts
but
if
necessity
required
in
more
remote
regions
and
although
the
public
treasury
might
receive
a
smaller
annual
revenue
from
these
provinces
yet
the
deficiency
would
be
abundantly
compensated
by
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
and
the
honour
of
its
sovereign
especially
as
the
heavy
and
dangerous
expenses
of
one
military
expedition
into
wales
usually
amount
to
the
whole
income

chapter
ix
in
what
manner
wales
when
conquered
should
be
governed
as
therefore
this
nation
is
to
be
subdued
by
resolution
in
the
manner
proposed
so
when
subdued
its
government
must
be
directed
by
moderation
according
to
the
following
plan
let
the
care
of
it
be
committed
to
a
man
of
a
firm
and
determined
mind
who
during
the
time
of
peace
by
paying
due
obedience
to
the
laws
and
respect
to
the
government
may
render
it
firm
and
stable
for
like
other
nations
in
a
barbarous
state
this
people
although
they
are
strangers
to
the
principles
of
honour
yet
above
all
things
desire
to
be
honoured
and
approve
and
respect
in
others
that
truth
which
they
themselves
do
not
profess
whenever
the
natural
inconstancy
of
their
indisposition
shall
induce
them
to
revolt
let
punishment
instantly
follow
the
offence
but
when
they
shall
have
submitted
themselves
again
to
order
and
made
proper
amends
for
their
faults
as
it
is
the
custom
of
bad
men
to
remember
wrath
after
quarrels
let
their
former
transgression
be
overlooked
and
let
them
enjoy
security
and
respect
as
long
as
they
continue
faithful
thus
by
mild
treatment
they
will
be
invited
to
obedience
and
the
love
of
peace
and
the
thought
of
certain
punishment
will
deter
them
from
rash
attempts
we
have
often
observed
persons
who
confounding
these
matters
by
complaining
of
faults
depressing
for
services
flattering
in
war
plundering
in
peace
despoiling
the
weak
paying
respect
to
revolters
by
thus
rendering
all
things
confused
have
at
length
been
confounded
themselves
besides
as
circumstances
which
are
foreseen
do
less
mischief
and
as
that
state
is
happy
which
thinks
of
war
in
the
time
of
peace
let
the
wise
man
be
upon
his
guard
and
prepared
against
the
approaching
inconveniences
of
war
by
the
construction
of
forts
the
widening
of
passes
through
woods
and
the
providing
of
a
trusty
household
for
those
who
are
cherished
and
sustained
during
the
time
of
peace
are
more
ready
to
come
forward
in
times
of
danger
and
are
more
confidently
to
be
depended
upon
and
as
a
nation
unsubdued
ever
meditates
plots
under
the
disguise
of
friendship
let
not
the
prince
or
his
governor
entrust
the
protection
of
his
camp
or
capital
to
their
fidelity
by
the
examples
of
many
remarkable
men
some
of
whom
have
been
cruelly
put
to
death
and
others
deprived
of
their
castles
and
dignities
through
their
own
neglect
and
want
of
care
we
may
see
that
the
artifices
of
a
crafty
and
subdued
nation
are
much
more
to
be
dreaded
than
their
open
warfare
their
than
their
anger
their
honey
than
their
gall
their
malice
than
their
attack
their
treachery
than
their
aggression
and
their
pretended
friendship
more
than
their
open
enmity
a
prudent
and
provident
man
therefore
should
contemplate
in
the
misfortune
of
others
what
he
ought
himself
to
avoid
correction
taught
by
example
is
harmless
as
ennodius
says
ruin
of
predecessors
instructs
those
who
succeed
and
a
former
miscarriage
becomes
a
future
if
a
prince
should
wish
these
great
designs
to
be
accomplished
without
the
effusion
of
blood
the
marches
as
we
before
mentioned
must
be
put
into
a
state
of
defence
on
all
sides
and
all
intercourse
by
sea
and
land
interdicted
some
of
the
welsh
may
be
stirred
up
to
deadly
feuds
by
means
of
stipends
and
by
transferring
the
property
of
one
person
to
another
and
thus
worn
out
with
hunger
and
a
want
of
the
necessaries
of
life
and
harassed
by
frequent
murders
and
implacable
enmities
they
will
at
last
be
compelled
to
surrender
there
are
three
things
which
ruin
this
nation
and
prevent
its
enjoying
the
satisfaction
of
a
fruitful
progeny
first
because
both
the
natural
and
legitimate
sons
endeavour
to
divide
the
paternal
inheritance
amongst
themselves
from
which
cause
as
we
have
before
observed
continual
fratricides
take
place
secondly
because
the
education
of
their
sons
is
committed
to
the
care
of
the
people
of
the
country
who
on
the
death
of
their
fathers
endeavour
by
all
possible
means
to
exalt
their
pupil
from
whence
arise
murders
conflagrations
and
almost
a
total
destruction
of
the
country
and
thirdly
because
from
the
pride
and
obstinacy
of
their
disposition
they
will
not
like
other
nations
subject
themselves
to
the
dominion
of
one
lord
and
king
chapter
x
in
what
manner
this
nation
may
resist
and
revolt
having
hitherto
so
partially
and
elaborately
spoken
in
favour
of
the
english
and
being
equally
connected
by
birth
with
each
nation
justice
demands
that
we
should
argue
on
both
sides
let
us
therefore
at
the
close
of
our
work
turn
our
attention
towards
the
welsh
and
briefly
but
effectually
instruct
them
in
the
art
of
resistance
if
the
welsh
were
more
commonly
accustomed
to
the
gallic
mode
of
arming
and
depended
more
on
steady
fighting
than
on
their
agility
if
their
princes
were
unanimous
and
inseparable
in
their
defence
or
rather
if
they
had
only
one
prince
and
that
a
good
one
this
nation
situated
in
so
powerful
strong
and
inaccessible
a
country
could
hardly
ever
be
completely
overcome
if
therefore
they
would
be
inseparable
they
would
become
insuperable
being
assisted
by
these
three
circumstances
a
country
well
defended
by
nature
a
people
both
contented
and
accustomed
to
live
upon
little
a
community
whose
nobles
as
well
as
privates
are
instructed
in
the
use
of
arms
and
especially
as
the
english
fight
for
power
the
welsh
for
liberty
the
one
to
procure
gain
the
other
to
avoid
loss
the
english
hirelings
for
money
the
welsh
patriots
for
their
country
the
english
i
say
fight
in
order
to
expel
the
natural
inhabitants
from
the
island
and
secure
to
themselves
the
possession
of
the
whole
but
the
welsh
maintain
the
conflict
that
they
who
have
so
long
enjoyed
the
sovereignty
of
the
whole
kingdom
may
at
least

having

in
