from

out
of
question
you
were
born
in
a
merry
hour
says
don
pedro
to
the
blithesome
heroine
of
much
ado
about
nothing
no

my
lord
answers
beatrice
my
mother
cried
but
then
there
was
a
star
danced
and
under
that
was
i
born
surely
a
star
possibly
venus
must
have
danced
gaily
on
a
certain
night
in
the
year
of
grace
when
the
wife
of
captain
oldfield
gentleman
by
birth
and
royal
guardsman
by
profession
brought
into
the
busy
unfeeling
world
of
london
a
pretty
mite
of
a
girl
was
a
year
of
grace
indeed
for
the
little
stranger
happened
to
be
none
other
than
anne
oldfield
whose
elegance
of
manner
charm
of
voice
and
action
and
loveliness
of
face
would
in
time
make
her
the
most
delightful
comedienne
of
her
day
perhaps
she
found
no
instant
welcome
this
diminutive
maiden
who
came
smiling
into
existence
laden
with
a
message
from
the
sunshine
her
father
was
richer
in
ancestry
than
guineas
and
the
arrival
of
another
daughter
may
have
seemed
an
honour
hardly
worth
the
bestowal
a
but
thalia
laughed
as
well
she
might
and
even
the
stern
features
of
melpomene
relaxed
a
little
in
witnessing
the
birth
of
one
who
would
prove
almost
as
wondrous
in
tragedy
when
she
so
minded
as
she
was
fascinating
in
the
gentler
phases
of
her
art
footnote
a
according
to
edmund
bellchambers
anne
oldfield
would
have
possessed
a
tolerable
fortune
had
not
her
father
a
captain
in
the
army
expended
it
at
a
very
early
period
yet
the
laughter
of
thalia
and
the
unbending
of
her
sister
muse
were
hardly
likely
to
make
much
impression
in
the
oldfield
household
where
money
had
more
admirers
than
mythology
and
so
we
are
not
surprised
to
learn
that
with
the
death
of
the
gallant
captain
this
incomparable
sweet
girl
who
would
ere
long
reconcile
even
a
supercilious
frenchman
to
the
english
stage
had
to
seek
her
living
as
a
seamstress
how
she
sewed
a
bodice
or
hemmed
a
petticoat
we
know
not
nor
do
we
care
it
is
far
more
interesting
to
be
told
that
though
only
in
her
early
teens
the
toiler
with
the
needle
found
her
greatest
recreation
in
reading
beaumont
and
fletcher
plays
the
modern
young
woman
be
her
station
high
or
low
would
take
no
pleasure
in
such
a
literary
occupation
but
in
the
days
of
nance
oldfield
to
con
the
pages
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
was
considered
a
privilege
rather
than
a
duty
then
again
the
little
seamstress
had
a
soul
above
threads
and
thimbles
her
heart
was
with
the
players
and
we
can
imagine
her
running
off
some
idle
afternoon
to
peep
slyly
into
drury
lane
theatre
or
perhaps
walk
over
into
lincoln
inn
fields
where
the
noble
betterton
and
his
companions
had
formed
a
rival
company
the
performance
over
she
hurries
to
the
mitre
tavern
in
market
and
here
she
is
sure
of
a
warm
welcome
as
is
but
natural
since
the
voss
who
rules
the
destinies
of
the
hostelry
is
elder
sister
a
here
the
girl
loves
to
spend
those
rare
moments
of
leisure
reading
aloud
the
comedies
of
long
ago
and
dreaming
of
the
future
and
here
too
it
is
that
dashing
captain
farquhar
listens
in
amazement
as
she
recites
the
scornful
lady
footnote
a
according
to
one
authority
voss
was
anne
aunt
we
adhere
however
to
doran
account
of
the
relationship
george
farquhar
how
his
name
conjures
up
a
vision
of
all
that
is
brilliant
rakish
and
bibulous
in
the
expiring
days
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
easy
to
picture
him
as
he
stands
near
the
congenial
bar
of
the
tavern
entranced
by
the
liquid
tones
and
marvellous
expression
of
nance
youthful
voice
he
has
a
whimsical
face
perhaps
showing
the
rubicund
effects
of
steady
drinking
as
whose
features
did
not
in
those
halcyon
times
of
merry
nights
and
tired
mornings
and
a
general
air
of
loving
the
world
and
its
pleasures
despite
a
secret
suspicion
that
a
bailiff
may
be
lying
in
wait
around
the
corner
his
flowing
wig
may
seem
a
trifle
old
the
embroidery
on
his
once
resplendent
vest
look
sadly
tarnished
and
the
cloth
of
his
skirted
coat
exhibit
the
unmistakable
symptoms
of
age
but
for
all
that
captain
farquhar
stands
forth
an
honourable
gentleman
and
gentleman
george
farquhar
is
both
by
birth
and
bearing
was
he
not
the
son
of
genteel
parents
living
in
the
north
of
ireland
and
did
he
not
receive
a
polite
education
at
the
university
in
dublin
so
polite
indeed
has
his
training
been
that
he
is
already
the
author
of
that
wonderful
love
and
a
bottle
a
comedy
wherein
he
amusingly
holds
the
mirror
up
to
english
vices
including
his
own
and
speaking
of
vices
he
can
now
look
back
to
those
salad
days
when
he
wrote
verses
of
unimpeachable
morality
setting
forth
among
other
sentiments
that
the
pliant
soul
of
erring
youth
is
like
soft
wax
or
moisten
clay
apt
to
receive
all
truth
or
yield
to
tyrant
ill
the
sway
shun
evil
in
your
early
years
and
manhood
may
to
virtue
rise
but
he
who
in
his
youth
appears
a
fool
in
age
will
be
wise
poor
fellow
he
never
will
be
wise
in
the
material
sense
he
will
trip
gracefully
through
life
with
more
brains
and
bonhomie
than
worldly
discretion
yet
eclipsing
many
steadier
companions
by
writing
the
recruiting
officer
and
other
sparkling
plays
not
forgetting
the
inconstant
which
will
last
even
unto
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
at
present
and
is
the
present
rather
than
the
past
or
future
that
most
concerns
the
captain
he
holds
a
commission
in
the
army
which
he
is
foolish
enough
to
relinquish
later
on
and
he
has
come
to
the
very
sensible
conclusion
that
he
is
far
more
at
home
in
the
writing
of
comedies
than
the
acting
therein
for
he
has
been
on
the
stage
and
precipitately
retired
therefrom
after
accidently
wounding
a
fellow
performer
a
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
years
farquhar
will
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
be
mercenary
by
marrying
a
girl
whom
he
supposes
to
be
wealthy
he
will
find
out
his
mistake
and
then
like
the
thoroughbred
that
he
is
will
go
on
cherishing
her
as
though
she
had
brought
him
a
ton
of
when
he
is
dead
and
gone
chetwood
the
veteran
prompter
of
drury
lane
will
tell
us
quaintly
enough
how
it
was
affirm
by
some
of
his
near
acquaintance
his
unfortunate
marriage
shortened
his
days
for
his
wife
by
whom
he
had
two
daughters
through
the
reputation
of
a
great
fortune
trick
him
into
matrimony
this
was
chiefly
the
fault
of
her
love
which
was
so
violent
that
she
was
resolved
to
use
all
arts
to
gain
him
tho
some
husbands
in
such
a
case
would
have
proved
yet
he
was
so
much
charm
with
her
love
and
understanding
that
he
liv
very
happy
with
her
therefore
when
i
say
an
unfortunate
marriage
with
other
circumstances
conducted
to
the
shortening
of
his
days
i
only
mean
that
his
fortune
being
too
slender
to
support
a
family
led
him
into
a
great
many
cares
and
inconveniences
footnote
a
farquhar
was
playing
in
the
indian
emperor
being
cast
for
guyomar
a
character
whose
pleasant
duty
it
is
to
kill
vasquez
the
spanish
general
this
particular
guyomar
forgot
to
change
his
sword
for
a
theatre
foil
and
in
the
subsequent
encounter
gave
vasquez
too
realistic
a
punishment
no
one
would
have
appreciated
the
unconscious
humour
of
assertion
about
some
husbands
more
than
farquhar
himself
one
trembles
to
think
by
the
way
what
a
mere
husband
must
have
been
in
the
reigns
of
william
or
anne
in
the
meantime
we
are
almost
forgetting
young
mistress
oldfield
who
is
still
reading
the
scornful
lady
and
putting
new
life
and
grace
into
lines
which
nowadays
seem
a
bit
academic
and
musty
the
captain
has
not
forgotten
her
however
on
the
contrary
he
is
so
charmed
with
what
he
hears
that
he
makes
some
flimsy
excuse
to
get
into
that
room
behind
the
bar
whence
the
silvery
voice
proceeds
there
he
first
meets
nance
surrounded
by
what
audience
we
know
not
and
is
struck
dumb
at
the
lovely
figure
standing
out
in
bashful
relief
as
it
were
against
a
background
of
wine
bottles
and
ale
tankards
there
is
an
awkward
pause
no
doubt
and
if
the
girl
of
fifteen
comes
to
a
sudden
stop
in
her
recital
farquhar
is
no
less
embarrassed
on
his
part
the
handsome
rosy
face
of
a
strapping
tavern
wench
would
not
have
startled
him
but
he
was
not
gazing
upon
a
bouncing
serving
maid
or
the
hoydenish
daughter
of
a
prosperous
innkeeper
he
beheld
a
creature
in
all
the
gentle
bloom
of
highbred
beauty
tall
and
radiating
a
sort
of
natural
elegance
with
a
expressive
face
to
which
great
speaking
eyes
and
a
mouth
half
pensive
half
smiling
lent
an
air
of
rare
distinction
these
were
the
eyes
which
in
after
years
anne
would
half
close
in
a
roguish
way
as
when
for
instance
she
meditated
a
brilliant
stroke
as
lady
betty
modish
and
then
opening
them
defiantly
would
make
them
glisten
with
the
spirit
of
twinkling
comedy
these
were
the
eyes
too
which
would
shine
forth
such
unutterable
love
when
she
played
cleopatra
that
one
might
well
pardon
the
peccadilloes
of
poor
antony
but
as
yet
there
was
no
thought
of
drooping
eyelids
or
amorous
glances
all
was
natural
and
nothing
more
so
than
the
coyness
of
nance
upon
seeing
the
author
of
love
and
a
bottle
captain
farquhar
had
never
before
beheld
this
seamstress
from
king
street
westminster
but
she
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
handsome
figure
of
one
who
had
drunk
many
a
brimming
glass
at
the
mitre
tavern
thus
when
he
made
bold
to
praise
her
elocution
she
was
not
offended
and
although
she
ignored
his
request
to
continue
the
scornful
lady
anne
proved
sufficiently
mistress
of
the
interruption
to
astonish
the
intruder
by
her
discourse
and
sprightly
wit
that
innate
breeding
of
which
no
amount
of
poverty
could
deprive
her
came
to
the
surface
to
show
that
a
woman
of
quality
is
none
the
worse
for
a
surprise
farquhar
bowing
low
with
a
grace
that
made
his
faded
clothes
seem
the
pink
of
fashion
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
flowery
compliments
which
became
all
the
stronger
when
he
heard
that
the
girl
knew
beaumont
and
fletcher
nearly
by
heart
she
must
have
blushed
looking
prettier
than
ever
as
the
visitor
went
on
and
how
that
young
heart
did
leap
as
he
predicted
for
her
a
glorious
future
on
the
stage
the
stage
the
of
all
her
hopes
the
very
idea
of
acting
filled
her
head
with
a
thousand
bewildering
fancies
and
as
she
told
chetwood
in
after
years
i
longed
to
be
at
it
and
only
wanted
a
little
decent
intreaties
the
decent
intreaties
were
forthcoming
nance
mother
who
evidently
rejoiced
in
a
prophetic
spirit
not
given
to
all
parents
strongly
agreed
with
farquhar
opinion
that
the
young
lady
should
try
a
theatrical
career
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
episode
was
that
captain
vanbrugh
took
an
interest
in
the
jewel
this
was
a
high
honour
vanbrugh
had
not
yet
made
for
himself
a
reputation
as
an
architect
by
building
blenheim
castle
for
the
marlboroughs
nor
had
he
changed
his
title
of
captain
for
sir
john
but
he
was
a
great
man
nevertheless
a
successful
dramatist
and
a
boon
companion
of
christopher
rich
manager
of
drury
lane
when
the
enthusiastic
farquhar
sounded
the
praises
of
anne
oldfield
the
future
sir
john
quickly
repaired
to
the
sign
of
the
mitre
with
which
no
doubt
he
was
already
familiar
and
met
the
young
enchantress
of
that
historic
little
room
behind
the
bar
the
arrival
of
this
second
and
more
distinguished
captain
was
evidently
the
signal
for
a
family
council
we
can
see
them
all
nance
glowing
with
excitement
her
aristocratic
beauty
heightened
by
a
dash
of
natural
colour
quite
different
from
the
rouge
she
might
use
later
voss
sleepy
comfortable
and
well
pleased

of
importance
and
maternal
solicitude
vanbrugh
with
his
smile
and
military
bearing
talks
in
a
fatherly
way
to
the
daughter
is
deeply
impressed
with
her
many
attractions
and
is
not
sorry
to
learn
that
her
ambition
is
all
for
comedy
he
promises
to
use
his
good
offices
with
rich
to
have
her
enrolled
as
a
member
of
the
drury
lane
company
keeps
his
word
too
something
for
a
gentleman
to
do
in
the
year
and
soon
has
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
new
protÃ©gÃ©e
hobnobbing
with
verbruggen
wilks
cibber
and
other
players
of
the
house
while
drawing
fifteen
shillings
a
week
for
the
privilege
to
hobnob
receive
a
few
shillings
and
do
next
to
nothing
on
the
stage
does
not
seem
a
glorious
beginning
for
our
heroine
but
think
of
the
inestimable
luxury
of
brushing
up
against
colley
cibber
this
remarkable
man
who
would
be
in
turn
actor

playwright
and
a
pretty
bad

death
would
put

house

about
a
twelvemonth

mute
and

first
recommended
her

her

part

this
gentle
character
happily
became
that
want
of
confidence
which
is
inseparable
from
young
beginners
who
without
it
seldom
arrive
to
any
excellence
notwithstanding
i
own
i
was
then
so
far
deceiv
in
my
opinion
of
her
that
i
thought
she
had
little
more
in
her
person
that
appeared
necessary
to
the
forming
a
good
actress
for
she
set
out
with
so
extraordinary
a
diffidence
that
it
kept
her
too
despondingly
down
to
a
formal
plain
not
to
say
flat
manner
of
speaking
footnote
a
an
apology
for
the
life
of
colley
cibber
how
strange
it
seems
as
we
peer
back
behind
the
scenes
of
history
to
think
of
a
theatrical
rejoicing
in
an
extraordinary
diffidence
rather
a
cynical
remark
is
it
the
reader
may
ask
well
perhaps
it
is
but
these
are
piping
times
of
advertising
when
even
genius
has
been
known
to
employ
a
press
agent
nance
oldfield
may
have
been
almost
mute
for
a
twelvemonth
yet
more
than
a
few
feminine
novices
anno
domino
would
never
be
content
to
remain
silent
not
only
must
they
make
a
noise
behind
the
footlights
but
they
feel
it
incumbent
to
be
heard
in
the
newspapers
as
well
any
dramatic
editor
could
tell
a
weary
tale
of
the
importunities
of
a
progressive
young
lady
who
wants
to
enlighten
an
aching
public
at
least
six
times
a
week
as
to
the
number
of
her
dresses
the
colour
of
her
hair
and
the
attention
of
her
admirers
there
is
a
blessed
consolation
in
all
this
the
female
with
the
trousseau
the
champagned
locks
and
the
notoriety
lasts
no
longer
than
the
butterfly
and
her
place
is
soon
taken
by
the
girl
who
never
bothers
about
the
paragraphs
because
she
is

my

easily

poor

you
wonder
that

contrived

the
wonder

is
that
she
obtained
any
rÃ´le
whatsoever
let
cibber
continue
the
story
while
he
frankly
confesses
that
even
he
could
form
a
false
estimate
of
a
colleague
it
was
in
this
part
oldfield
surpris
me
into
an
opinion
of
her
having
all
the
innate
powers
of
a
good
actress
though
they
were
yet
but
in
the
bloom
of
what
they
promis
before
she
had
acted
this
part
i
had
so
cold
an
expectation
from
her
abilities
that
she
could
scarce
prevail
with
me
to
rehearse
with
her
the
scenes
she
was
chiefly
concerned
in
with
sir
courtly
which
i
then
acted
however
we
ran
them
over
with
a
mutual
inadvertency
of
one
another
i
careless
as
concluding
that
any
assistance
i
could
give
her
would
be
to
little
or
no
purpose
and
she
mutter
out
her
words
in
a
sort
of
mifty
manner
at
my
low
opinion
of
her
but
when
the
play
came
to
be
acted
she
had
just
occasion
to
triumph
over
the
error
of
my
judgment
by
the
almost
amazement
that
her
unexpected
performance
awak
me
to
so
forward
and
sudden
a
step
into
nature
i
had
never
seen
and
what
made
her
performance
more
valuable
was
that
i
knew
it
all
proceeded
from
her
own
understanding
untaught
and
unassisted
by
any
one
more
experienced
actor
in
the
original

in
pursuance
of
that
method
of
capitalising
every
third
or
fourth
word

any
particular
rhyme

reason
has
spelled
occasion
with
a
big
o
well
he
might
for
it
was
perhaps
the
most
important
occasion
in
all
the
eventful
life
of
oldfield
she
would
win
many
a
more
popular
triumph
in
days
to
come
but
what
were
all
of
them
compared
to
the
honour
of
having
compelled
the
writer
to
admit
that
he
had
blundered
though
this
part
of
leonora
in
itself
was
of
so
little
value
that
when
she
got
more
into
esteem
it
was
one
of
the
several
she
gave
away
to
inferior
actresses
yet
it
was
the
first
as
i
have
observed
that
corrected
my
judgment
of
her
and
confirmed
me
in
a
strong
belief
that
she
could
not
fail
in
very
little

she
was

what
care
we
for
the
prologue
when
the
first
scene
is
on
and
violante
and
leonora
are
confessing
their
respective
love
affairs
as
women
always
do
on
the
stage
leonora
has
a
dragon
of
a
brother
who
would
compel
her
to
marry
that
pink
of
empty
propriety
sir
courtly
but
she
rebels
against
the
admirer
selected
for
her
as
all
young
women
should
in
plays
and
sets
her
heart
upon
another
in
consequence
there
is
trouble
of
the
dear
old
romantic
kind
i
never
stir
out
but
as
they
say
the
devil
does
with
chains
and
torments
leonora
tells

that

oh

no

no

these
twenty
years
the
devil
of

sucked
it
all
out
and
let
verjuice
in
the
roome
these
lines
are
decidedly
unfeminine
and
coarse
as
viewed
from
a
nineteenth
century
standard
and
there
is
nothing
in
them
to
recommend
the
two
girls
to
the
particular
favour
of
the
audience
yet
in
the
case
of
leonora
they
are
given
with
such
rare
spirit
and
the
speaker
with
her
almost
sensuous
charm
and
the
melody
of
that
marvellous
voice
is
so
fascinating
that
the
house
is
suddenly
caught
in
some
entrancing
spell
oldfield
has
burst
upon
it
in
all
the
sudden
glory
of
a
newly
unfolded
flower
and
murmurs
of
admiration
and
surprise
are
heard
on
every
side
more
than
this
queen
anne
whose
thoughts
may
have
been
far
away
with
the
dead
duke
of
gloucester
betrays
a
sudden
interest
in
the
performance
and
thus
sets
the
fashion
for
all
those
around
her
excepting
his
most
sleepy
royal
highness
the
prince
of
denmark
he
dozes
on
twenty
angels
from
heaven
would
not
disturb
him
as
the
play
proceeds
the
curiosity
centres
around
the
new
leonora
so
that
even
the
scene
where
sir
courtly
is
found
making
the
most
elaborate
of
toilets
with
the
assistance
of
a
bevy
of
vocalists
does
not
exert
the
attraction
to
be
found
in
the
presence
of

the
episode
is
all
very
funny

chapter
ii
an
while
anne
oldfield
is
resting
from
her
first
triumph
and
preparing
for
another
let
us
glance
for
a
moment
at
the
theatrical
conditions
which
surround
her
curious
perplexing
conditions
they
are
marking
as
they
do
a
transition
between
the
brilliant
but
generally
filthy
period
of
the
restoration
a
period
in
which
some
of
the
worst
and
some
of
the
best
of
plays
saw
the
light
and
the
time
when
the
punctilio
and
artificial
decency
of
the
age
will
cast
over
the
stage
the
cold
light
of
formality
and
restraint
the
nation
is
but
slowly
recovering
from
the
licentiousness
which
characterised
the
merry
reign
of
charles
that
witty
sceptical
sovereign
who
never
believed
in
the
honesty
of
man
nor
the
virtue
of
frail
woman
the
playwrights
are
recovering
too
yet
if
anything
more
tardily
than
the
people
for
when
a
nasty
cynicism
like
that
pervading
the
old
comedies
is
once
boldly
cultivated
many
a
long
day
must
elapse
ere
it
can
be
replaced
by
a
cleaner
healthier
spirit
charles
has
surely
had
much
to
answer
for
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
a
bar
for
which
he
evidently
felt
a
profound
contempt
and
the
evil
influence
which
he
and
his
court
exerted
on
the
drama
supplies
one
of
the
greatest
blots
on
his
moral
augustus
william
schlegel
that
foreigner
who
studied
the
literature
of
the
english
stage
as
few
britons
have
ever
done
well
pointed
out
that
while
the
puritans
had
brought
republican
principles
and
religious
zeal
into
public
odium
this
monarch
seemed
expressly
born
to
dispel
all
respect
for
the
kingly
dignity
england
was
inundated
with
the
foreign
follies
and
vices
in
his
train
the
court
set
the
fashion
of
the
most
undisguised
immorality
and
this
example
was
the
more
extensively
contagious
as
people
imagined
that
they
showed
their
zeal
for
the
new
order
of
things
by
an
extravagant
way
of
thinking
and
living
the
fanaticism
of
the
republicans
had
been
accompanied
with
true
strictness
of
manners
and
hence
nothing
appeared
more
convenient
than
to
obtain
the
character
of
royalists
by
the
extravagant
inclination
for
all
lawful
and
unlawful
pleasures
the
age
of
louis
xiv
was
nowhere
imitated
with
greater
depravity
the
prevailing
gallantry
at
the
court
of
france
was
not
without
reserve
and
tenderness
of
feeling
they
sinned
if
i
may
so
speak
with
some
degree
of
dignity
and
no
man
ventured
to
attack
what
was
honourable
though
his
own
actions
might
not
exactly
coincide
with
it
the
english
played
a
part
which
was
altogether
unnatural
to
them
they
gave
themselves
heavily
up
to
levity
they
everywhere
confounded
the
coarsest
licentiousness
with
free
mental
vivacity
and
did
not
perceive
that
the
sort
of
grace
which
is
still
compatible
with
depravity
disappears
with
the
last
veil
which
it
throws
off
as
schlegel
goes
on
to
say
we
can
easily
imagine
into
what
direction
the
tastes
of
the
english
people
drifted
under
such
auspices
they
possessed
no
real
knowledge
of
the
fine
arts
and
these
were
merely
favoured
like
other
foreign
fashions
and
inventions
of
luxury
they
neither
felt
a
true
want
of
poetry
nor
had
any
relish
for
it
they
merely
wished
to
be
entertained
in
a
brilliant
and
light
manner
the
theatre
which
in
its
former
simplicity
had
attracted
the
spectators
solely
by
the
excellence
of
the
dramatic
works
and
the
actors
was
now
furnished
out
with
all
the
appendages
with
which
we
are
at
this
day
familiar
but
what
is
gained
in
external
decoration
is
lost
in
internal
worth
in
other
words
the
theatrical
life
and
literature
of
the
restoration
was
morally
rotten
to
the
core
how
that
rottenness
has
been
giving
way
during
the
childhood
of
nance
oldfield
to
what
may
be
styled
a
comparative
decency
need
not
be
described
here
suffice
it
to
explain
that
such
a
change
is
taking
place
and
let
us
accordingly
sing
rejoice
and
give
thanks
for
small
mercies
thalia

ceased

used
the

satirically
but
how
well
it
suited
the
minds
of
many
pious
persons
ranging
all
the
way
from
bishops
to
humble
laymen
who
could
see
nothing
in
the
theatre
excepting
the
prospective
flames
of
the
infernal
regions
clergymen
preached
against
the
playhouse
then
just
as
some
of
them
have
done
since
and
will
continue
so
to
do
until
the
arrival
of
the
millennium
oftentimes
the
criticisms
of
these
gentlemen
had
more
than
a
grain
of
truth
to
make
them
half
justifiable
the
stage
was
still
far
from
pure
in
spite
of
the
improvement
which
was
going
on
steadily
enough
and
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
that
several
of
the
worst
plays
of
the
restoration
could
still
claim
admirers
even
sir
courtly
nice
wherein
occurs
one
of
the
most
indecent
passages
ever
penned

one
of
the
most
suggestive
of
songs

without
a
murmur
congreve
was
pardoned
for
his
breaches
of
decorum
and
dryden
was
looked
upon
as
quite
proper
enough
for
all
purposes
the
of
the
players
could
hardly
be
called
unimpeachable
at
least
in
some
instances
but
the
violations
of
social
rules
were
not
so
open
as
they
had
been
in
the
old
days
here
and
there
a
frail
actress
might
depart
from
the
stony
path
of
virtue
or
an
actor
give
himself
up
to
wine
and
the
dodging
of
bailiffs
yet
the
attending
scandals
were
not
flaunted
in
the
face
of
the
public
in
other
words
there
were
thespians
of
doubtful
reputation
then
just
as
there
are
now
and
these
black
sheep
helped
materially
to
keep
up
against
their
white
brethren
that
remarkable
prejudice
which
has
endured
even
unto
the
present
decade
as
a
class
the
players
had
no
social
position
of
any
kind
although
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
the
men
of
rank
never
hesitated
to
hobnob
with
them
when
like
gamp
they
felt
so
dispoged
even
in
the
enlightened
reign
of
queen
anne
there
existed
among
many
intelligent
persons
the
vague
idea
that
one
who
trod
the
boards
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
vagabond
and
we
are
not
surprised
to
learn
therefore
that
in
a
royal
proclamation
of
the
period
players
and
mountebanks
are
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
as
though
there
was
little
difference
between
them
perhaps
the
artists
to
whom
the
title
of
vagabond
might
be
applied
with
a
certain
degree
of
justice
were
the
strolling
players
who
seem
to
have
been
much
after
the
fashion
of
others
of
their
ilk
before
and
since
barnstormers
they
doubtless
were
living
and
quite
willing
to
go
through
the
whole
gamut
of
tragedy
from
shakespeare
to
dryden
for
the
sake
of
a
good
supper
here
is
a
graphic
picture
of
such
a
band
of
dramatic
drawn
by
dick
steele

from
offending

are
so
far
from
falling

who
in

was

quixote
in

so
highly
provoked

told
them
if
they
would
move
compassion
it
should
be
in
their
own
persons
and
not
in
the
characters
of
distressed
princes

potentates
he
told
them
if
they
were
so
good
at
finding
the
way
to
people
hearts
they
should
do
it
at
the
end

bridges

church
porches

their
proper
vocation

beggars
this
the
justice
says
they
must
expect
since
they
could
not

contented
to
act

such

days
when
noblemen
often
had
their
own
companies
of
actors

were
empowered
to
regulate

these
dramatic

is
curious
that
the

the

royal

the
house
in

in

drury

interior
as
it
appeared
in
its
original
form
before
the
making
of
changes
intended
to
enlarge
the
seating
capacity
it
must
be
observed
then
that
the
area
or
platform
of
the
old
stage
projected
about
four
feet
forwarder
in
a
figure
parallel
to
the
benches
of
the

and
that
the

lower
doors
of
entrance

and

boxes
are

that
where
the
doors
of

now
are

formerly
stood
two
additional

front
to
a
full
set
of
scenes
which
had
then
almost
a
double
effect
in
their
loftiness
and
magnificence
by
this
original
form
the
usual
station
of
the
actors
in
almost
every
scene
was
advanc
at
least
ten
foot
nearer
to
the
audience
than
they
now
can
be
because
not
only
from
the
stage
being
shorten
in
front
but
likewise
from
the
additional
interposition
of
those
stage
boxes
the
actors
in
respect
to
the
spectators
that
fill
them
are
kept
so
much
more
backward
from
the
main
audience
than
they
us
to
be
but
when
the
actors
were
in
possession
of
that
forwarder
space
to
advance
upon
the
voice
was
then
more
in
the
centre
of
the
house
so
that
the
most
distant
ear
had
scarce
the
least
doubt
or
difficulty
in
hearing
what
fell
from
the
weakest
utterance
all
objects
were
thus
drawn
nearer
to
the
sense
every
painted
scene
was
stronger
every
grand

more

every

are
swallowed
up

colley
goes
on
to

that
tho
the
giddy

accepted

bracegirdle
had
a
different
way
of
thinking

desir

good
sense

not
to
be
misled
by
the
insidious
favour

knew
the
stage
was
wide
enough
for
her
success
without
entering
into
any
such
rash
and
invidious
competition
with
barry
and
therefore
wholly
refus
acting
any

properly
belong
to
her

came
the

the

to

with

this
drew
into
his
party

valuable

to
secure
their
unity
enter
with

sort

stand

fall
together

exemplified
by

down

of
great
use

me
when
many
years

came
to
be
a

myself
i
laid
it
down
as
a
settled
maxim
that
no

could
flourish

the
chief
actors
and
the
undertakers
were
at
variance

made
it
a
point

it
was
possible
upon
tolerable
terms
to
keep
the
valuable

in

was

i
do
not

he
tells
us
that
ever
i
made
a
promise
to
any
that
i
did

contain
the
very
spirit

essence
of
that
old

comedy
wherein
the

was
nothing
more
than
a
handsome
rake
and
the
heroine

not
a
straitlaced
puritan

time

honesty
and
virtue
went
for

upon
the
stage
and
the
greatest
honours
were
awarded
to
the
theatrical
prince
charming
who
proved
more
unscrupulous
than
his
fellows
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
careless
husband
is
a
vast
improvement
in
point
of
decency
on
many
of
the
plays
that
preceded
it
and
marks
a
turning
point
in
the
moral
atmosphere
of
those
that
came
after
he
who
now
reads
it
for
the
first
time
says
doran
may
be
surprised
to
hear
that
in
this
comedy
a
really
serious
and
eminently
successful
attempt
to
reform
the
licentiousness
of
the
drama
was
made
by
one
who
had
been
himself
a
great
offender
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
in
lord
morelove
we
have
the
first
lover
in
english
comedy
since
licentiousness
possessed
it
who
is
at
once
a
gentleman

honest
man

we
have
what
was
hitherto
unknown
or
laughed
at
a
virtuous
married
woman
to
go
further
it
may
be
added
that
the
story
points
an
unexceptionable
moral
proving
that
the
best
thing
for
a
husband
to
do
in
this
world
is
to
be
true
to
the
legitimate
companion
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
with
all
this
in
favour
of
the
careless
husband
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
play
if
presented
in
its
original
form
would
not
be
tolerated
by
the
audiences
of
a
the
dialogue
is
often
coarse
and
suggestive
although
for
the
most
part
full
of
sparkle
and
mother
wit
while
the
plot
smacks
of
intrigue
lying
and
adultery
but
it
is
a
fine
work
for
all
that
there
is
a
delightful
flavour
about
it
as
of
old
wine
and
we
feel
in
reading
each
successive
scene
that
we
are
uncorking
a
rare
literary
bottle
of
the
vintage
how
much
of
the
vintage
of
will
stand
equally

uncorking
process

proffers
of
a
genius
i
was
no
longer
at
a
loss
for
support
my
doubts
were
dispell
and
i
had
now
a
new
call
to
finish
it
illustration
robert
wilks
the
painting
john
ellys
and
finish
the
play
cibber
did
casting
nance
for
the
volatile
lady
betty
and
producing
it
under
the
most
brilliant
auspices
the
whole
assignment
of
characters
was
admirable
but
the
first
lady
betty
bursting
upon
the
town
in
sudden
glory
threw
all
her
companions
into
the
shade
never
had
such
a
fine
lady
of
comedy
been
seen
said
the
critics
never
had
an
actress
who
was
not
expected
to
be
in
the
affairs
of
the
quality
displayed
such
gentility
and
evidence
of
being
heaven
knew
how
quite
to
the
manner
born
never
was
woman
so
bubbling
over
with
humour
said
the
people
as
for
colley
he
was
delighted
of
course
but
believing
that
an
honest
confession
is
good
for
the
soul
even
for
the
soul
of
a
poet
laureate
he
has
left
us
the
following
graceful
tribute
to
the
important
part
played
by
the
actress
in
making
the
careless
husband
a
success
whatever
favourable
reception
this
comedy
has
met
with
from
the
publick
it
would
be
unjust
in
me
not
to
place
a
large
share
of
it
to
the
account
of
oldfield
not
only
from
the
uncommon
excellence
of
her
action
but
even
from
her
personal
manner
of
conversing
there
are
many
sentiments
in
the
character
of
lady
betty
modish
that
i
may
almost
say
were
originally
her
own
or
only
dress
with
a
little
more
care
than
when
they
negligently
fell
from
her
lively
humour
here
we
have
a
clue
to
that
vivacity
and
which
distinguished
anne
off
the
stage
as
well
as
on
can
it
be
that
she
rather
than
cibber
suggested
this
dashing
bit
of
dialogue
from
the
comedy
lady
betty
lady
easy
oh
my
dear
i
am
overjoyed
to
see
you
i
am
strangely
happy
i
have
just
received
my
new
scarf
from
london
and
you
are
most
critically
come
to
give
me
your
opinion
of
it
lady
easy
o
your
servant
madame
i
am
a
very
indifferent
judge
you
know
what
is
it
with
sleeves
lady
betty
o
is
impossible
to
tell
you
what
it
is
is
all
extravagance
both
in
mode
and
fancy
my
dear
i
believe
there
six
thousand
yards
of
edging
in
it
then
such
an
enchanting
slope
from
the
elbow
something
so
new
so
lively
so
noble
so
and
charming
but
you
shall
see
it
my
dear
lady
easy
indeed
i
wo
my
dear
i
am
resolv
to
mortify
you
for
being
so
wrongfully
fond
of
a
trifle
lady
betty
nay
now
my
dear
you
are
lady
easy
why
truly
i
am
half
angry
to
see
a
woman
of
your
sense
so
warmly
concerned
in
the
care
of
her
outside
for
when
we
have
taken
our
best
pains
about
it
is
the
beauty
of
the
mind
alone
that
gives
us
lasting
value
lady
betty
oh
my
dear
my
dear
you
have
been
a
married
woman
to
a
fine
purpose
indeed
that
know
so
little
of
the
taste
of
mankind
take
my
word
a
new
fashion
upon
a
fine
woman
is
often
a
greater
proof
of
her
value
than
you
are
aware
of
lady
easy
that
i
ca
comprehend
for
you
see
among
the
men
nothing
more
ridiculous
than
a
new
fashion
those
of
the
first
sense
are
always
the
last
that
come
into
em
lady
betty
that
is
because
the
only
merit
of
a
man
is
his
sense
but
doubtless
the
greatest
value
of
a
woman
is
her
beauty
an
homely
woman
at
the
head
of
a
fashion
would
not
be
allowed
in
it
by
the
men
and
consequently
not
followed
by
the
women
so
that
to
be
successful
in
one
fancy
is
an
evident
sign
of
one
being
admir
and
i
always
take
admiration
for
the
best
proof
of
beauty
as
beauty
certainly
is
the
source
of
power
as
power
in
all
creatures
is
the
height
of
happiness
lady
easy
at
this
rate
you
would
rather
be
thought
beautiful
than
good
lady
betty
as
i
had
rather
command
than
obey
the
wisest
homely
woman
ca
make
a
man
of
sense
of
a
fool
but
the
veryest
fool
of
a
beauty
shall
make
an
ass
of
a
statesman
so
that
in
short
i
see
a
woman
of
spirit
has
any
business
in
this
world
but
to
dress
and
make
the
men
like
her
lady
easy
do
you
suppose
this
is
a
principle
the
men
of
sense
will
admire
you
for
lady
betty
i
do
suppose
that
when
i
suffer
any
man
to
like
my
person
he
sha
dare
to
find
fault
with
my
principle
lady
easy
but
men
of
sense
are
not
so
easilly
humbled
lady
betty
the
easiest
of
any
one
has
ten
thousand
times
the
trouble
with
a
coxcomb
men
of
sense
my
dear
make
the
best
fools
in
the
world
their
sincerity
and
good
breeding
throws
them
so
entirely
into
one
power
and
gives
one
such
an
agreeable
thirst
of
using
them
ill
to
show
that
power
is
impossible
not
to
quench
it
compare
this
bristling
dialogue
with
the
inane
stuff
that
too
often
passes
for
comedy
nowadays
and
one
finds
all
the
difference
between
real
humour
and
flippancy
we
stand
at
the
threshold
of
the
twentieth
century
boastfully
proclaiming
that
we
do
everything
better
than
ever
could
our
ancestors
yet
where
are
the
new
comedies
that
might
hold
a
candle
to
the
careless
husband
the
inconstant
or
the
school
for
scandal
we
may
be
presumptuous
enough
nevertheless
to
hold
up
that
candle
but
the
light
from
it
will
burn
pale
and
dim
when
placed
near
the
golden
glow
of
the
past
would
that
we
could
purify
some
of
the
pieces
and
thus
preserve
them
for
future
generations
of
alas
that
is
impossible
for
to
cleanse
them
with
a
sort
of
moral
soap
and
water
would
destroy
nearly
all
their
delightful
glitter
the
lines
of
lady
betty
must
have
fairly
sizzled
with
the
fire
of
comedy
as
they
fell
from
the
pretty
lips
of
oldfield
no
wonder
that
londoners
thought
the
character
bewitching
no
wonder
that
cibber
wrote
so
enthusiastically
of
the
actress
in
that
wonderful
apology
had
her
birth
plac
her
in
a
higher
rank
of
life
he
notes
perhaps
forgetting
that
her
very
descent
entitled
the
poor
to
a
position
which
poverty
denied
her
she
had
certainly
appear
in
reality
what
in
this
play
she
only
excellently
acted
an
agreeably
gay
woman
of
quality
a
little
too
conscious
of
her
natural
attractions
i
have
often
seen
her
in
private
societies
where
women
of
the
best
rank
might
have
borr
some
part
of
her
behaviour
without
the
least
diminution
of
their
sense
or
dignity
and
this
very
morning
when
i
am
now
writing
at
the
bath
november
the
same
words
were
said
of
her
by
a
lady
of
condition
whose
better
judgment
of
her
personal
merit
in
that
light
has
embolden
me
to
repeat
them
the
best
of
us
have
a
wee
bit
of
snobbishness
buried
deep
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
our
souls
and
colley
who
was
neither
the
best
nor
the
worst
of
humanity
had
this
quality
well
developed
to
see
that
one
has
but
to
read
the
above
quotation
between
the
lines
he
loved
a
lord
as
ardently
as
did
the
next
man
and
he
attached
to
rank
the
same
exaggerated
importance
which
pervades
with
all
the
unwelcome
odour
of
sickening
incense
the
literature
of
his
age
as
macklin
so
well
said
of
him
nature
formed
cibber
for
a
coxcomb
and
it
is
quite
probable
that
he
took
greater
delight
in
being
thought
a
leader
of
fashion
than
a
writer
of
charming
plays
indeed
he
was
careful
to
cultivate
the
society
of
young
noblemen
and
this
he
was
able
to
do
by
virtue
of
his
theatrical
successes
and
more
helpful
still
by
a
levity
of
character
which
stuck
to
him
despite
his
great
earnestness
in
many
directions
perhaps
his
frivolity
and
his
love
of
pleasure
including
the
delights
of
the
gaming
table
may
have
been
half
assumed
perhaps
he
was
only
playing
one
of
his
many
parts
he
certainly
succeeded
in
the
rÃ´le
he
enlivened
the
dissipations
of
many
a
beau
by
his
quaint
conceits
and
flashes
of
humour
and
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
that
he
could
be
the
boon
companion
of
twenty
idle
lords
a
footnote
a
colley
cibber
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
dramatic
autobiographers
is
also
one
of
the
most
amusing
he
flourished
in
wig
and
embroidery
player
poet
and
manager
during
the
augustan
age
of
queen
anne
somewhat
earlier
and
somewhat
later
a
most
egregious
fop
according
to
all
accounts
he
was
but
a
very
pleasant
one
notwithstanding
as
your
fop
of
parts
is
apt
to
be
pope
gained
but
little
in
the
warfare
he
waged
with
him
for
this
plain
reason
that
the
great
poet
accuses
his
adversary
of
dullness
which
was
not
by
any
means
one
of
his
sins
instead
of
selecting
one
of
the
numerous
faults
such
as
pertness
petulance
and
presumption
of
which
he
was
really
mitford
if
he
was
surprised
therefore
that
oldfield
could
act
the
woman
of
fashion
the
lady
of
condition
who
shall
blame
him
a
tavern
does
not
seem
the
proper
school
for
deportment
and
though
one
has
the
bluest
blood
in
christendom
humble
surroundings
may
keep
it
from
flowing
very
freely
still
anne
was
naturally
a
thoroughbred
the
girl
had
a
personal
distinction
which
was
hers
by
right
of
inheritance
and
what
she
lacked
in
elegance
she
was
quick
to
acquire
as
she
grew
into
womanhood
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
the
actress
who
in
after
years
rejuvenated
lady
betty
a
and
made
her
again
a
living
breathing
creature
had
at
one
period
of
her
career
been
a
tavern
girl
abington
it
was
who
seemed
the
very
incarnation
of
aristocracy
and
made
the
audience
forget
that
high
as
she
stood
upon
the
stage
she
had
once
been
almost
in
the
gutter
footnote
a
abington
one
of
the
most
graceful
and
spirited
actresses
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
born
in
shortly
after
the
death
of
oldfield
she
had
the
honour
of
being
the
original
lady
teazle
a
part
which
she
rehearsed
under
the
direction
of
sheridan
and
she
enjoyed
the
further
distinction
of
being
detested
by
garrick
the
latter
said
of
her
she
is
below
the
thought
of
any
honest
man
or
woman
the
same
welcome
anomaly
is
noticed
now
when
the
actresses
who
play
the
women
of
the
hupper
circles
with
the
greatest
delicacy
and
keenness
of
touch
are
frequently
the
products
of
the
lower

middle
class

de
who
trips
lightly
from

blare
of
trumpets

the
excitement
of
her
friends
usually
fails
to
make
a
mark
to
be
sure
several
of
them
have
made
marks
very
black
ones
now
let
us
turn
the
pages
of
the
careless
husband
as
we
scan
them
in
lowndes
british
theatre
and
see
if
we
can
not
extract
some
amusement
therefrom
the
scene
opens
in
the
lodgings
of
sir
charles
easy
who
like
many
other
dramatic
personages
of
the
eighteenth
century
has
a
name
that
signifies
his
character
easy
sir
charles
is
in
every
sense
of
the
word
particularly
easy
as
to
morals
for
the
possession
of
a
lovely
wife
does
not
prevent
him
from
prosecuting
an
amour
with
a
woman
of
quality
lady
graveairs
or
having
a
vulgar
intrigue
with
the
maid
of
his
own
spouse
in
fine
he
is
a
right
amiable
gentleman
according
to
the
curious
standards
of
long
ago
a
very
prince
of
good
fellows
who
in
these
days
would
pass
for
a
cad
we
are
hardly
begun
with
the
comedy
before
we
are
introduced
to
this
paragon
who
enters
just
after
lady
easy
and
the
maid
edging
have
discovered
fresh
proofs
of
his
flirtation
with
lady
graveairs
charles
is
inclined
to
be
philosophical
in
a
blasÃ©
tired
way
and
he
says
how
like
children
do
we
judge
of
happiness
when
i
was
stinted
in
my
fortune
almost
everything
was
a
pleasure
to
me
because
most
things
then
being
out
of
my
reach
i
had
always
the
pleasure
of
hoping
for
now
fortune
in
my
hand
she
as
insipid
as
an
old
acquaintance
it
mighty
silly
faith
just
the
same
thing
by
my
wife
too
i
am
told
she
extremely
handsome
as
though
the
sad
devil
did
know
it
nay
and
have
heard
a
great
many
people
say
she
is
certainly
the
best
woman
in
the
world
why
i
do
know
but
she
may
yet
i
could
never
find
that
her
person
or
good
qualities
gave
me
any
concern
in
my
eye
the
woman
has
no
more
charms
than
my
mother
and
we
may
be
sure
that
sir
charles
had
never
bothered
himself
much
about
the
attractions
of
the
last
named
lady
then
the
fair
edging
comes
to
centre
of
stage
and
the
following
innocent
dialogue
ensues
edging
hum
he
takes
no
notice
of
me
yet
i
let
him
see
i
can
take
as
little
notice
of
him
walks
by
him
gravely
he
turns
her
about
and
holds
her
she
pray
sir
sir
charles
a
pretty
pert
air
that
i
humour
it
what
the
matter
child
are
you
not
well
kiss
me
hussy
edging
no
the
deuce
fetch
me
if
i
do
here
was
a
model
servant
of
course
sir
charles
has
anything
put
thee
out
of
humour
love
edging
no
sir
is
not
worthy
my
being
out
of
humour
at
you
suffer
my
lady
to
huff
me
every
day
as
if
i
were
her
dog
or
had
no
more
concern
with
you
i
declare
i
wo
bear
it
and
she
think
to
huff
me
for
aught
i
know
i
am
as
agreeable
as
she
and
though
she
dares
not
take
any
notice
of
your
baseness
to
her
you
sha
think
to
use
me
so
but
enough
of
this
delectable
conversation
the
picture
which
it
gives
us
is
unpleasant
and
coarse
there
is
about
it
none
of
the
glitter
that
can
make
vice
so
alluring
we
will
also
skip
an
interview
between
sir
charles
and
lady
easy
who
thinks
it
the
part
of
diplomacy
to
hide
her
knowledge
of
her
master
peccadilloes
and
hurry
on
to
the
entrance
of
lord
morelove
our
hero
morelove
who
must
have
been
admirably
played
by
the
fiery
impetuous
powell
is
neither
a
libertine
nor
on
the
other
hand
a
prig
he
is
simply
a
gentlemanly
and
essentially
human
fellow
who
is
consumed
with
an
honest
passion
for
lady
betty
modish
nay
he
would
be
glad
to
marry
the
fine
creature
but
she
has
quarrelled
with
him
and
he
is
now
telling
sir
charles
all
about
it
so
disputing
with
her
about
the
conduct
of
women
i
took
the
liberty
to
tell
her
how
far
i
thought
she
err
in
hers
she
told
me
i
was
rude
and
that
she
would
never
believe
any
man
could
love
a
woman
that
thought
her
in
the
wrong
in
anything
she
had
a
mind
to
rather
exacting
are
you
not
lady
betty
at
least
if
he
dared
to
tell
her
so
this
provok
me
into
her
whole
character
with
as
much
spite
and
civil
malice
as
i
have
seen
her
bestow
upon
a
woman
of
true
beauty
when
the
men
first
toasted
her
a
so
in
the
middle
of
my
wisdom
she
told
me
she
desir
to
be
alone
that
i
would
take
my
odious
proud
heart
along
with
me
and
trouble
her
no
more
i
bow
very
low
and
as
i
left
the
room
i
vow
i
never
wou
and
that
my
proud
heart
should
never
be
humbled
by
the
outside
of
a
fine
woman
about
an
hour
after
i
whipp
into
my
chaise
for
london
and
have
never
seen
her
since
footnote
a
many
of
the
wits
of
the
last
age
will
assert
that
the
word
toast
in
its
present
sense
was
known
among
them
in
their
youth
and
had
its
rise
from
an
accident
at
the
town
of
bath
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
it
happened
that
on
a
public
day
a
celebrated
beauty
of
those
times
was
in
the
cross
bath
and
one
of
the
crowd
of
her
admirers
took
a
glass
of
the
water
in
which
the
fair
one
stood
and
drank
her
health
to
the
company
there
was
in
the
place
a
gay
fellow
half
fuddled
who
offered
to
jump
in
and
swore
though
he
liked
not
the
liquor
he
would
have
the
toast
he
was
opposed
in
his
resolution
yet
this
whim
gave
foundation
to
the
present
honour
which
is
done
to
the
lady
we
mention
in
our
liquors
who
has
ever
since
been
called
a
the
what
a
quaint
circumspect
and
very
ceremonious
affair
must
that
lovers
row
have
been
no
swearing
no
slang
or
loud
talking
but
everything
deliberate
and
in
the
best
of
form
lady
betty
telling
morelove
to
go
about
his
business
and
that
quickly
but
doing
so
with
a
stately
elegance
worthy
of
the
great
barry
the
suitor
bowing
low
with
his
white
hand
pressed
against
that
odious
proud
heart
which
is
gently
breaking
at
the
thought
of
departing
what
a
nice
painting
it
would
make
for
a
watteau
fan
thus
nearly
all
our
characters
have
their
entrances
lady
betty
is
revealed
to
us
through
the
medium
of
the
lively
dialogue
quoted
a
few
pages
back
and
then
there
is
another
stir
in
comes
lord
foppington
otherwise
colley
cibber
in
all
the
vapid
glory
of
fine
clothes
and
a
great
periwig
a
very
prince
of
coxcombs
with
his
soft
smile
and
conscious
air
of
superiority
a
mere
bag
of
vanity
whose
emptiness
is
partly
hidden
by
gorgeous
raiment
gold
embroidery
rings
muff
and
with
what
genteel
condescension
does
he
greet
sir
charles
how
gracefully
nonchalant
is
he
to
my
lord
morelove
my
dear
agreeable
je
pardi
il
y
a
cent
ans
que
je
ne
my
lord
i
am
your
lordship
most
obedient
humble
servant
so
foppington
takes
his
place
in
the
comedy
and
begins
to
play
his
brainless
but
important
part
he
the
disconsolate
morelove
and
the
brilliant
lady
betty
all
meet
at
dinner
with
sir
charles
and
lady
easy
of
course
the
hero
makes
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
regain
the
good
graces
of
his
inamorata
and
of
course
the
coxcomb
carries
on
a
violent
flirtation
with
her
in
the
angry
face
of
his
rival
with
the
meal
over
and
everybody
on
the
this
scene
ensues
enter
foppington
who
has
been
chatting
to
the
ladies
and
who
now
seeks
the
conversation
of
his
host
and
lord
morelove
foppington
nay
sir
charles
let
have
a
little
of
thee
we
have
been
so
chagrin
without
thee
that
stop
my
breath
what
a
bloodcurdling
oath
so
suggestive
of
the
awful
curses
of
our
own
the
ladies
are
gone
half
asleep
to
church
for
want
of
thy
company
sir
charles
that
hard
indeed
while
your
lordship
was
among
is
lady
betty
gone
too
fop
she
was
just
upon
the
wing
but
i
caught
her
by
the
and
she
pretends
to
stay
to
see
if
i
give
it
her
again
or
no
more
death
is
that
i
gave
her
and
the
only
present
she
ever
would
receive
from
me
sir
charles
ask
him
how
he
came
by
it
sir
charles
do
be
uneasy
did
she
give
it
to
you
my
lord
fop
faith
charles
i
ca
say
she
did
or
she
did
not
but
we
were
playing
the
fool
and
i
took
it
pshah
i
ca
tell
thee
in
french
neither
but
horace
touches
it
to
a
nicety
was
direptum
male
our
modern
comedians
seldom
quote
horace
their
humour
is
not
of
the
classic
kind
more
so
but
i
must
bear
it
if
your
lordship
has
a
mind
to
the
box
i
stand
by
you
in
the
keeping
of
it
fop
my
lord
i
passionately
oblig
to
you
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
answer
your
hazarding
so
much
of
the
lady
favour
more
not
at
all
my
lord
is
possible
i
may
not
have
the
same
regard
to
her
frown
that
your
lordship
has
here
a
bit
of
human
nature
morelove
stands
in
awe
of
that
frown
but
he
doth
valiantly
protest
and
that
too
much
that
the
displeasure
of
lady
betty
is
no
more
to
him
than
a
dozen
of
ciphers
fop
that
a
bite
i
am
sure
he
give
a
joint
of
his
little
finger
to
be
as
well
with
her
as
i
am
but
here
she
comes
charles
stand
by
me
must
not
a
man
be
a
vain
coxcomb
now
to
think
this
creature
follow
one
sir
charles
nothing
so
plain
my
lord
fop
flattering
devil
lady
betty
lady
betty
pshah
my
lord
foppington
do
play
the
fool
now
but
give
me
my
sir
charles
help
me
to
take
it
from
him
sir
charles
you
know
i
hate
trouble
madame
lady
betty
pooh
you
make
me
stay
still
prayers
are
half
over
now
fop
if
you
promise
me
not
to
go
to
church
i
give
it
you
lady
betty
i
promise
nothing
at
all
for
positively
i
will
have
it
with
fop
then
comparatively
i
wo
part
with
it
ha
ha
with
lady
betty
o
you
devil
you
have
kill
my
arm
oh
well
if
let
me
have
it
i
give
you
a
better
more
sir
charles
o
charles
that
has
a
view
of
distant
kindness
in
it
fop
nay
now
i
keep
it
superlatively
i
find
there
a
secret
value
in
it
lady
betty
o
dismal
upon
my
word
i
am
only
ashamed
to
give
it
you
do
you
think
i
wou
offer
such
an
odious
fancy
thing
to
anybody
i
had
the
least
value
for
sir
charles
lord
morelove
now
it
comes
a
little
nearer
methinks
it
does
not
seem
to
be
any
kindness
at
all
fop
why
really
madame
upon
second
view
it
has
not
extremely
the
mode
of
a
lady
utensil
are
you
sure
it
never
held
anything
but
snuff
lady
betty
o
you
monster
fop
nay
i
only
ask
because
it
seems
to
me
to
have
very
much
the
air
and
fancy
of
monsieur
smoakandfot
more
i
can
bear
no
more
sir
charles
why
do
then
i
step
into
the
company
and
return
to
your
relief
immediately
more
lady
betty
come
madame
will
your
ladyship
give
me
leave
to
end
the
difference
since
the
slightness
of
the
thing
may
let
you
bestow
it
without
any
mark
of
favour
shall
i
beg
it
of
your
ladyship
lady
betty
o
my
lord
no
body
sooner
i
beg
you
give
it
my
lord
earnestly
lord
foppington
smiling
gives
it
lord
morelove
then
bows
gravely
to
more
only
to
have
the
honour
of
restoring
it
to
your
lordship
and
if
there
be
any
other
trifle
of
mine
your
lordship
has
a
fancy
to
tho
it
were
a
mistress
i
do
know
any
person
in
the
world
who
has
so
good
a
claim
to
my
resignation
in
the
hands
of
powell
cibber
and
oldfield
this
scene
must
have
had
all
the
sparkle
of
champagne
but
let
us
hope
speaking
of
wine
that
the
prince
of
paragons
morelove
was
perfectly
sober
or
shall
we
say
comparatively
sober
for
when
bibulous
george
had
just
a
dash
of
spirits
within
him
and
that
was
nearly
always
there
came
a
roseate
hue
to
his
acting
which
rather
added
to
its
romantic
colour
sometimes
this
colour
was
laid
on
too
garishly
as
the
supply
of
happened
to
be
larger
a
and
sir
john
vanbrugh
has
himself
left
it
on
record
that
powell
as
worthy
came
well
nigh
spoiling
the
original
production
of
the
relapse
i
own
writes
sir
john
the
first
night
this
thing
was
acted
some
indecencies
had
like
to
have
happened
but
it
was
not
my
fault
the
fine
gentleman
of
the
play
drinking
his
mistress
health
in
nantes
brandy
from
six
in
the
morning
to
the
time
he
waddled
up
upon
the
stage
in
the
evening
had
toasted
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
vigour
i
confess
i
once
gave
up
amanda
for
gone
and
am
since
with
all
due
respect
to
rogers
very
sorry
she
escaped
for
i
am
confident
a
certain
lady
let
no
one
take
it
to
herself
that
is
handsome
who
highly
blames
the
play
for
the
barrenness
of
the
conclusion
would
then
have
allowed
it
a
very
natural
close
it
should
be
added
that
the
rogers
herein
mentioned
as
playing
amanda
was
a
capable
tragic
actress
whose
ambition
it
was
to
enact
none
but
virtuous
women
her
own
virtue
but

are
dipping
into
scandal

to
the
folly
of
intoxication

added
the
horrors
of

was
so
hunted
by
the

that
he
usually
walked
the

with

her
fondness
for
virtue
on
the
stage
she
began
to
think
might
persuade
the
world
that
it
had
made
an
impression
on
her
private
life
and
the
appearance
of
it
actually
went
so
far
that
in
an
epilogue
to
an
obscure
play
the
profits
of
which
were
given
to
her
and
wherein
she
acted
a
part
of
impregnable
chastity
she
bespoke
the
favour
of
the
ladies
by
a
protestation
that
in
honour
of
their
goodness
and
virtue
she
would
dedicate
her
unblemished
life
to
their
example
part
of
this
vestal
vow
i
remember
was
contained
in
the
following
verse
study
to
live
the
character
i
play

alas
how
weak
are
the
strongest
works
of
art
when
nature
besieges
cibber
as
for
the
careless
husband
the
more
one
reads
from
it
the
more
cause
is
there
to
regret
the
utter
hopelessness
of
reviving
a
play
so
honeycombed
by
inuendo
how
delightfully
for
instance
would
some
of
the
badinage
between
morelove
and
the
spirited
lady
betty
have
been
treated
in
the
earlier
days
of
the

what

he
looked
upon

a

sole
mission
in

was
to
make
him
rich
in

as

after

performance
of
that
pious
act
betake
themselves
to
the
evil
gentleman
for
aught
he
cared
several
modern
managers
have
been
equally
appreciative
but
it
is
a
comfort
to
reflect
that
a
portion
of
the
fraternity
are
vast
improvements
on
crusty
christopher
who
was
described
by
a
contemporary
as
an
old
snarling
lawyer

graphic
is
this

with
its
vision
of
sly
crafty
christopher
as
he
denies
the
players
their
wages
and
then
hurries
them
off
to
a
neighbouring

get

grudgingly
to
pay

this
loss

profit
they
only
had
such
verbal
accounts

he
thought
proper
to
give
them

true
he
would
sometimes
advance

money
but
not
more
than
he
knew
at
most
could
be
due
to
them
upon
their
bonds
upon
which
whenever
they
were
mutinous
he
would
threaten
to
sue
them
this
was
the

we
danc
in

no

we
were

quite
in

he
had
no
patience

with
the
philistianism

had
that
fatal
fondness
for
paying
extraordinary

it

it

happened
that
cibber
was
one
of
the
men
that
swiney
needed
most
and
while
the
new
manager
of
the
haymarket
apparently
acquiesced
in
the
exception
insisted
on
by
rich
it
was
not
long
before
he
showed
his
hand
it
was
a
better
hand
than
that
of
his
whilom
associate
who
had
been
foolish
enough
to
think
that
he
held
the
trump
card
in
the
game
the
card
in
question
was
a
little
matter
of
two
hundred
pounds
owing
from
swiney
to
rich
and
the
latter
fondly
believed
that
this
loan
would
bind
the
debtor
to
him
as
with
hooks
of
steel
but
we
do
not
love
men
the
more
because
they
chance
to
be
our
creditors
sometimes
indeed
we
love
them
the
less
for
it
and
so
these
two
hundred
pounds
did
not
prevent
the
celt
from
breaking
over
the
traces
of
the
englishman
let
cibber
continue
the
story
the
first
word
i
heard
of
this
transaction
was
by
a
letter
from
swiney
inviting
me
to
make
one
in
the
company
whom
he
hop
i
could
not
but
now
think
the
stronger
party
but
i
confess
i
was
not
a
little
alarm
at
this
revolution
for
i
considered
that
i
knew
of
no
visible
fund
to
support
these
actors
but
their
own
industry
that
all
his
recruits
from
drury
lane
would
want
new
cloathing
and
that
the
warmest
industry
would
be
always
labouring
up
hill
under
so
necessary
an
expence
so
bad
a
situation
and
so
inconvenient
a
theatre
in
fine
master
colley
resolved
that
it
would
be
the
course
of
wisdom
to
stay
at
drury
lane
where
he
seems
to
have
enjoyed
to
an
unusual
degree
the
confidence
of
the
very
manager
whom
afterwards
he
did
not
hesitate
to
abuse
so
when
cibber
came
up
to
london
from
gloucestershire
where
he
had
been
spending
his
vacation
he
returned
to
the
fold
of
his
old
master
but
i
found
our
company
so
thinn
that
it
was
almost
impracticable
to
bring
any
one
tolerable
play
upon
the
stage
when
i
ask
him
where
were
his
actors
and
in
what
manner
he
intended
to
proceed
he
reply
you
trouble
yourself
come
along
and
i
shew
he
then
led
me
about
all
the
in
the
house
and
me
fifty
little
backdoors
dark
closets
and
narrow
passages
in
alterations
and
contrivances
of
which
kind
he
had
busied
his
head
most
part
of
the
vacation
for
he
was
scarce
ever
without
some
notable
joyner
or
a
bricklayer
extraordinary
in
pay
for
twenty
years
and
there
are
so
many
odd
obscure
places
about
a
theatre
that
his
genius
in
was
never
out
of
employment
nor
could
the
most
author
be
more
deaf
to
an
interruption
in
reciting
his
works
than
our
wise
master
was
while
entertaining
me
with
the
improvements
he
had
made
in
his
invisible
architecture
all
which
without
thinking
any
one
part
of
it
necessary
tho
i
seem
to
approve
i
could
not
help
now
and
then
breaking
in
upon
his
delight
with
the
impertinent
question
of
master
where
are
your
this
exhibition
of
a
spirit
so
commonplace
and
inartistic
proved
too
much
for
cibber
perhaps
he
might
have
pardoned
it
had
there
been
no
salary
owing
him
for
your
greatest
apostle
of
the
drama
will
sometimes
do
a
good
deal
of
winking
at
glaring
inconsistencies
when
a
money
pro
looms
up
in
the
distance
here
was
a
case
however
where
the
pro
loomed
not
at
all
and
the
author
of
the
careless
husband
became
correspondingly
disgusted
i
told
him
rich
i
came
to
serve
him
at
a
time
when
many
of
his
best
actors
had
deserted
him
that
he
might
now
have
the
refusal
of
me
but
i
could
not
afford
to
carry
the
compliment
so
far
as
to
lessen
my
income
by
it
that
i
therefore
expected
either
my
casual
pay
to
be
advanced
or
the
payment
of
my
former
sallary
made
certain
for
as
many
days
as
we
had
acted
the
year
before
no
he
was
not
willing
to
alter
his
former
method
but
i
might
chuse
whatever
parts
i
had
a
mind
to
act
of
theirs
who
had
left
him
when
i
found
him
as
i
thought
so
insensible
or
impregnable
i
look
gravely
in
his
face
and
told
him
he
knew
upon
what
terms
i
was
willing
to
serve
him
and
took
my
leave
shortly
after
the
interview
cibber
joined
the
haymarket
company
and
one
result
of
his
defection
was
an
open
quarrel
between
rich
and
swiney
this
season
of
was
a
memorable
one
for
oldfield
she
then
played
for
the
first
time
with
the
chaste
anne
bracegirdle
a
whom
she
quickly
cast
into
the
shade
so
apparent
indeed
was
the
shadow
that
the
elder
of
the
two
retired
from
the
stage
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
in
the
very
prime
of
her
beauty
it
was
a
pathetic
incident
and
yet
the
cloud
had
its
silver
lining
how
often
are
we
called
upon
to
pity
players
who
linger
before
the
footlights
long
after
they
should
have
made
their
exits
instead
of
departing
at
the
right
moment
leaving
behind
them
charming
memories
they
die
by
inches
in
full
view
of
the
audience

work
but
be
that
as
it
may

public
gives
a
sigh

relief
when
the
few
remaining
sparks
of
genius
are
at
last
snuffed
out
when

is
taken
from

he
shuffled
off

we

placidly

never

again
many
a

gets
this
cruel
epitaph
there
was
nothing
superannuated
about
bracegirdle
when
she
made
her
exit

the
actress

displayed
that
comeliness
which
had

tony

black
sparkling

whenever

herself

involuntary

face
having
continually
a
cheerful
aspect

a
fine
set
of
even
white
teeth

that
she
left
the
audience

an
imitation

her
pleasant
countenance

she
saw

a

where
there
would
be
neither

about

efforts
of
colonel
brett
a
a
very
gentleman
from
gloucestershire
whom
cibber
his
warmest
admirer
trots
out
for
our
inspection
in
the
perennial
apology
it
appears
that
sir
thomas
skipwith
who
has
a
share
in
the
drury

patent
becomes
so
disgusted
with
the
antics
of
rich

refusal
to
make
any
accounting
of
the
profits
of
the
house
that
he
presents

the
gift
is
a

one
he
has
passed
many
a

doubtless
thinks

they
persuaded
him
that
he
might
have
a
better
chance
of
fortune
by
throwing
such
accomplishments
into
the
gayer
world
than
by
shutting
them
up

a
figure

is
to

in

hopeful
quest
of

came
this
not
doubting
but
the
fickle
dame
while
he
was
thus
qualified
to
receive
her
might
be
tempted
to
fall
into
his
lap
and
though
possibly
the
charms
of
our
theatrical
nymphs
might
have
their
share
in
drawing
him
thither
yet
in
my
observation
the
most
visible
cause
of
his
first
coming
was
a
more
sincere
passion
he
had
conceived
for
a
fair
perriwig
which
i
then
wore
in
my
first
play
of
the
in
fashion
in
the
year
this
love
affair
would
suggest
what
gilbert
calls
a

Ã

for
a
bashful
young

we
not
to
remember
that
in
anne

periwigs
were
regarded
with
an
enthusiasm
far
too
fervid
to
be
called
platonic
actors
made
it
a
point
to
have
this
indispensable

as
elaborate
as
possible

it
is
even
related

and
wilks
actually
paid
forty
guineas
each
on
the
exorbitant
thatching
of
their
heads
but
let
loquacious
colley
have
his
say
for
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
of
those
days
were
of
a
quite
different
cast
from
the
modern
stamp
and
had
more
of
the
stateliness
of
the
peacock
in
their
mein
than
which
now
seems
to
be
their
highest
emulation

pert
air
of
a
now

contempt
philosophers
may
have
for
a
fine
perriwig
my
friend
who
was
not
to
despise
the
world
but
to
live
in
it
knew
very
well
that
so
material
an
article
of
dress
upon
the
head
of
a
man
of
sense
if
it
became
him
could
never
fail
of
drawing
to
him
a
more
partial
regard
and
benevolence
than
could
possibly
be
hoped
for
in
an
one
brett
expresses
such
an
admiration
for
this
particular
periwig
that
cibber
is
highly
flattered
and
the
two
are
soon
laughing
themselves
into
the
best
of
terms
nay
they
spend
the
night
roistering
over
a
bottle
or
two
of
wine
and
dear
vain
colley
like
many
who
come
after
him
falls
into
the
belief
that
he
is
a
bold
fast
man
with
an
air
of
conscious
rakishness
that
is
charmingly
ridiculous
he
writes
if
it
were
possible
the
relation
of
the
happy
indiscretions
which
passed
between
us
that
night
could
give
the
tenth
part
of
the
pleasure
i
then
received
from
them
i
could
still
repeat
them
with
delight
instead
of
pausing
however
to
relate
those
happy
indiscretions
cibber
prattles
on
in
his
colloquial
way
telling
us
that

the
goodly
offices
of
sir
thomas
skipwith
brett
was
introduced
to
the
divorced
wife
of
the
earl

then
was
the
model
gentleman
to
whom
skipwith
made
over
a
share
in
the
drury
lane
patent
and
through
whose
efforts
the
rival
companies
were
united
in
swiney
according
to
the
orders
of
the
lord
chamberlain
was
to
conduct
the
haymarket
for
operatic
performances
and
the
players
were
all
to
act
at
the
older
house
for
a
time
life
at
the
theatre
went
as
merrily
as
a
marriage
bell
the
public
of
both
high
and
low
degree
crowded
drury
lane
and
every
one
was
happy
excepting
rich
who
saw
with
disgust
that
the
plausible
insinuating
brett
was
fast
overshadowing
him
in
the
management
how
wily
christopher
schemed
and
schemed
and
how
the
gay
colonel
was
finally
compelled
to
relinquish
his
portion
of
the
patent
altogether
are
details
that
need
not
be
set
forth
here
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
as
a
result
of
all
this
intriguing
affairs
at
drury
lane
assumed
an
almost
chaotic
character
nor
was
it
long
before
owen
swiney
entered
into
treaty
with
wilks
dogget
oldfield
and
cibber
who
were
to
come
over
to
the
haymarket
as
the
heads
of
a
new
company
in
this
episode
the
sunny
spirit
of
nance
was
brought
prettily
into
the
foreground
when
oldfield
was
nominated
as
a
joint
sharer
in
our
new
agreement
to
be
made
with
swiney
again
is
the
quotation
from
cibber
dogget
who
had
no
objection
to
her
merit
insisted
that
our
affairs
could
never
be
upon
a
secure
foundation
if
there
was
more
than
one
sex
admitted
to
the
management
of
them
beastly
unchivalrous
dogget
were
you
alive
how
the
new
woman
would
champ
with
rage
he
therefore
hop
that
if
we
offer
oldfield
a
instead
of
a
share
she
would
not
think
herself
slighted
and
oldfield
with
the
affability
which
sat
so
well
upon
her
did
not
think
herself
in
the
least
slighted
she
receiv
it
rather
as
a
favour
than
a
disobligation
her
demands
therefore
were
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
certain
and
a
benefit
clear
of
all
charges
which
were
readily

the
meantime

of

to

extracts
great
comfort
from

published
in
his

by
the

philosophise
when
in

stately

he
gazes
on
his
sword
and
plans
to
admit
the
grim
visitor
whom
the
most
of
us
wish
to
keep
without
our
threshold
until
the
last
fatal
moment
how
those
lines
used
to
thrill
the
classic
hearts
of
our
ancestors
how
barton
booth
who
shook
the
stage
and
made
the
people
stare
could
put
into
this
mild
plea
for
suicide
a
fervour
that
caused
drury
lane
to
ring
with
applause
what
mattered
it
if
the
actor
as
pope
related
wore
a
long
wig
and
flowered
gown
cato
was
none
the
less
himself
for
that
nor
did
booth
elegance
of
delivery
seem
unwelcome
because
his
clothes
pictured
the
dandified
spirit
of
the
eighteenth
century
cato
the
play
is
forgotten
now
but
there
was
magic
in
its
name
in
the
palmy
days
of
its
author
gentle
kindly
joseph
addison
so
potent
was
that
magic
such
vivid
impression
did
the
fate
of
the
grand
old
roman
make
on
more
than
one
mind
when
thus
retold
in
lofty
verse
that
the
tragedy
was
cited
as
a
justification
of
what
cato
did
and
addison
approved
can
not
be
wrong
these
lines
written
on
a
scrap
of
paper
by
eustace
budgell
were
found
shortly
after
the
death
of
that
odd
genius
from
being
an
honoured
contributor
to
the
budgell
descended
to
the
depths
of
infamy
poverty
and
despair
and
so
one
day
he
threw
himself
out
of
a
boat
under
london
bridge
and
the
waters
of
the
thames
closed
over
him
for
ever
he
owed
his
early
prosperity
to
addison
his
cousin
and
by
way
of
gratitude
he
sought
to
throw
upon
his
benefactor
memory
the
odium
of
this
moist
and
melancholy
exit
from
the
world
their
lies
no
odium
nevertheless
where
addison
is
concerned
his
own
life
may
have
been
clouded
towards
the
last
by
the
mists
of
disappointment
but
to
us
admiring
moderns
he
is
all
sunshine
not
the
fiery
sunshine
of
summer
but
the
genial
dignified
light
of
an
autumn
afternoon
when
nature
seems
in
most
reflective
mood
for
there
was
nothing
impetuous
or
ardent
in
the
composition
of
this
philosopher
and
while
he
railed
so
well
at
the
petty
sins
and
vanities
of
the
england
in
which
he
dwelt
the
satire
had
naught
of
venom
malice
or
uncharitableness
nowadays
addison
and
the
go
rolling
down
to
fame
together
an
indivisible
reminder
the
very
essence
indeed
of
the
virtues
peccadilloes
greatness
and
meanness
of
early
eighteenth
century
life
we
may
forget
that
joe
was
quite
a
politician
in
his
prime
we
are
even
loth
to
recall
that
there
was
ever
such
a
play
as
cato
but
so
long
as
the
english
language
has
power
to
charm
the
dear
old
volumes
of
the

stand
out
as
a

forms
the

happy

over
what
portrait
do
we
linger
more
lovingly
than
that
of
the
himself
wherein
there
is
many
a
stroke
of
the
pen
that
brings
addison
in

when
he
tells

the
essayist
had
always
possessed
like
many
other
literary
men
a
secret
longing
to
be
the
author
of
a
prosperous
tragedy
and
in
his
earlier
days
made
bold
to
submit
a
play
to
the
inspection
of
dryden
the
poet
read
it
with
polite
interest
and
on
returning
the
manuscript
to
the
author
expressed
therefor
his
profound
esteem
with
many
apologetic
and
only
regretted
that
in
his
humble
opinion
the
piece
if
placed
upon
the
stage
would
not
meet
with
its
deserved
success
in
other
words
dryden
saw
that
addison
was
sadly
wanting
in
dramatic
instinct
but
was
too
forbearing
to
say
this
in
plain
set
terms
as
for
the
young
man
he
must
have
felt
much
after
the
fashion
of
the
aspiring
writer
who
receives
an
article
back
from
an
unappreciative
magazine
with
a
printed
slip
warning
him
that
the
rejection
of
manuscript
does
not
imply
lack
of
merit
the
whole
thing
being
intended
as
a
moral
cushion
to
break
the
suddenly
descending
spirits
of
the
sender
years
later
the
great
man
was
favoured
with
another
cushion
of
this
sort
by
no
less
a
person
than
his
friend
alexander
pope
whose
august
criticism
he
asked
in
behalf
of
cato
the
major
part
of
the
play
all
of
it
in
fact
excepting
the
last
act
had
been
written
when
addison
first
began
to
fall
under
the
passionate
influence
of
french
tragedy
with
its
tiresome
regularity
of
form
and
attempted
imitation
of
the
classic
drama
a
and
a
powerful
influence
it
was
in
the
days
of
good
queen
anne
so
powerful
verily
that
it
almost
emasculated
the

for
a

was
the
cry

of
the
author

he
put
the

to
a
production
which
was
to
be
famous
for
the

arose

for

place
attention

those

summed
up

to

left
it

days
i
gave
him
my
opinion

he
had

that
he
would
get

thinking

the
piece
was
not
theatrical
enough
some
time
after
addison
said
his
own
opinion
was
the
same
with
mine
but
that
some
particular
friends
of
his
whom
he
could
not
disoblige

on

were

queen

take
herself
to
another

and
the
friends
of
the
hanoverian
succession
grew
sorely
anxious
they
were
filled
with
delight
therefore
on
hearing
that
addison
had
peacefully
slumbering
in
his
desk
a
drama
which
as
maynwaring
explained
was
written
not
for
the
love

to
support
the
old
roman

point

those
who
to
think
liberty
in
danger
and
had
likewise
to
think
that
a

might
preserve
dr

so
it
came
about
that
one
fine
day
the
company
at
drury
lane
began
the
rehearsal
of
cato
under
circumstances
however
which
hardly
pointed
to
a
successful
production
there
appears
to
have
been
some
difficulty
in
the
assignment
of
parts
and
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
at
first
the
players
exercised
their
prerogative
of
growling
a
prerogative
not
calculated
to
dispel
the
doubts
fast
assailing
addison
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
performance
nance
oldfield
made
no
fuss
at
playing
marcia
cato
daughter
for
she
was
ever
disposed
to
be
tractable
but
when
it
came
to
casting
the
noble
roman
himself
the
trouble
began
the
story
runs
that
the
part
was
first
offered
to
cibber
and
that
he
sensibly
refused
it
colley
might
make
a
delightful
fop
but
the
playing
of
dandies
could
hardly
lead
one
up
very
gracefully
to
the
handling
of
cato
next
came
the
suggestion
that
john
mills
a
should
try
the
character
but
fortunately
he
displayed
no
more
enthusiasm
for
it
than
did
cibber
cato
was
too
old
a
person
for
him
to
act
he
said
and
so
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
elderly
hero
afterwards
he
was
cast
for
the
less
important
rÃ´le
of
sempronius
which
proved
in
every
way
a
better
disposition
of
affairs
for
mills
was
a
plodder
rather
than
a
genius
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
actors
to
whom
in
the
present
day
we
apply
the
charitable
word
of
painstaking
an
adjective
which
shows
very
plainly
the
nature
of
the
man
while
it
likewise
allows
the
critic
to
escape
the
charge
of
unkindness
we
all
know
the
painstaking
player
and
always
cheerfully
acknowledge
his
virtues
but
who
shall
blame
us
if
after
giving
him
the
benefit
of
his
earnestness
we
yawn
and
creep
out
into
the
lobby
while
he
holds
the

footnote
a
mills
was
considered
one
of
the
most
useful
actors
that
ever
served
in
a
theatre
but
though
invested
by
the
patronage
of
wilks
with
many
parts
of
the
highest
order
he
had
no
pretensions
to
quit
the
secondary
line
in
which
he
ought
to
have
been
bellchambers
that
mills
sometimes
inspired
this
feeling
of
boredom
may
be
imagined
from
the
way
in
which
his
performance
of
macbeth
was
once
received
to
those
who
remembered
how
magnificently
betterton
had
played
the
part
the
chill
formalism
of
the
new
aspirant
must
have
seemed
presumptuous
and
one
night
the
contrast
proved
too
much
for
a
country
gentleman
possessed
of
more
honesty
than
politeness
after
watching
the
progress
of
the
tragedy
with
growing
indignation
his
feelings
became

at
a
certain
point

go

a
footnote
a
i
recollect
says
bellchambers
an
incident
of
the
same
sort
occurring
at
bristol
where
a
very
indifferent
actor
declaimed
so
long
and
to
such
little
purpose
that
an
honest
farmer
who
sat
in
the
pit
started
up
with
evident
signs
of
disgust
and
waving
his
hand
to
motion
the
speaker
off
cried
out
away
tak
away
and
let
have
another
thus
every
one
must
have
given
a
sigh
of
relief
when
industrious
john
objected
to
the
age
of
cato
every
one
at
least
excepting
wilks
who
had
taken
this
actor
under
his
theatrical
wing
and
sought
to
elevate
him
above
one
far
greater
than
either
of
them
barton
booth
the
fact
was
that
wilks
hid
within
his
breast
the
troublesome
monster
of
jealousy
he
feared
the
rising
genius
of
booth
and
now
that
he
was
part
manager
of
drury
lane
probably
took
pains
to
keep
the
rival
as
much
as
possible
in
the
background
unfortunately
for
this
plan
of
annihilation
the
screen
provided
in
the
commonplace
person
of
mills
proved
entirely
too
flimsy
to
hide
the
coming
man
barton
booth
was
in
many
ways
an
ideal
actor
in
that
he
was
blessed
with
the
poetic
imagination
and
scholarship
to
understand
his
rÃ´les
and
the
tragic
power
to
play
them
he
had
furthermore
a
voice
of
marvellous
resonance
an
aristocratic
bearing
and
a
handsome
face
and
figure
which
were
sure
to
attract
attention
whether
he
appeared
upon
the
stage
or
amid
the
more
genial
confines
of
the
bedford
it
was
to
booth
therefore
that
cato
was
finally
assigned
the
other
masculine
parts
being
handed
over
to
cibber
mills
wilks
powell
ryan
bowman
and
keen
the
latter
was
a
popular
actor
of
majestic
mould
who
used
to
play
the
king
in
hamlet
a
rÃ´le
too
often
left
to
the
mercies
of
mouthers
in
a
fashion
which
would
have
justified
the
loyal
and
historic
gentleman
who
preferred
that
character
to
all
others
in
the
play
as
already
mentioned
marcia
was
to
be
acted

mighty

the
rehearsals
now
went
on
apace
but
evidently
without
much
show
of
enthusiasm
addison
assisted
probably
dispirited
and
nervous
but
outwardly
unruffled
for
he
always
presented
a
front
to
the
honest
dick
steele
looked
on
and
in
that
frank
ingenuous
way
he
told
his
friends
with
perhaps
a
suspicious
flush
on
his
winsome
face
and
a
swimming
gleam
in
his
eyes

he
was

there

he
was
not

merely
to

or
in

he
pottered
around
unceasingly
hobnobbed
with
oldfield
who
now
began
to
take
the
liveliest

in
the

suggested
several
alterations

ventured

portius
the
amiable

unlike
the

amiable
authors
heard
her
objections
with
approval
and
soon
pope
was
again
called
into
consultation
there
was
more
hobnobbing
a
change
of
diction
and
the
rehearsals
continued
then
to

the
climax
of
poetic
condescension
little
alexander
honoured
cato
with
a

prologue
wherein
he
set
forth
archaically
enough

to
wake
the
soul

strokes

to
raise
the

and
to

they

at

came
the
eventful
evening
of
april
when
cato
saw
the
light
the
theatre
was
packed
just
as
steele
promised
that
it
should
be
yet
the
audience
would
have
been
large
had
dick
never
existed
there
were
no
press
agents
to
boom
matters
but
as
it
became
known
that
the
whigs
stood
sponsors
for
the
tragedy
there
was
a
corresponding
desire
to
be
in
either
at
its
triumph
or
its
death
the
result
has
passed
into
history
the
characters
were
for
the
most
part
finely
acted
and
the
play
was
admired
for
its
lofty
sentiments
and
elegance
of
expression
while
the
tories
vied
with
their
enemies
in
enthusiastic
tokens
of
approval
the
whigs
went
to
the
theatre
expecting
to
appropriate
all
of
addison
illusions
to
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
and
what
must
have
been
their
horror
on
finding
that
the
tories
refusing
to
be
discomfited
by
any
of
those
illusions
applauded
as
violently
as
did
the
friends
of
hanover
pope
has
left
us
a
description
of
this
first
night
in
a
letter
to
sir
william
trumbull
cato
he
writes
was
not
so
much
the
wonder
of
rome
in
his
days
as
he
is
of
britain
in
ours
and
though
all
the
foolish
industry
possible
has
been
used
to
make
it
thought
a
party
play
yet
what
the
author
once
said
of
another
may
the
most
properly
in
the
world
be
applied
to
him
on
this
occasion
itself
is
dumb
in
wonder
lost
and
factions
strive
who
shall
applaud
him
most
a
footnote
a
from
addison
poem
of
the
campaign
wherein
the
author
sings
of
the
greatness
of
marlborough
the
numerous
and
violent
claps
of
the
whig
party
on
the
one
side
of
the
theatre
were
echoed
by
the
tories
on
the
other
while
the
author
sweated
behind
the
scenes
with
concern
to
find
their
applause
proceeding
more
from
the
hand
than
the
head
this
was
the
case
too
of
the
prologue
writer
who
was
clapped
into
a
staunch
whig
at
almost
every
two
lines
i
believe
you
have
heard
that
after
all
the
applause
of
the
opposite
faction
my
lord
bolingbroke
sent
for
booth
who
played
cato
into
the
box
between
one
of
the
acts
and
presented
him
with
fifty
guineas
in
acknowledgement
as
he
expressed
it
for
defending
the
cause
of
liberty
so
well
against
a
perpetual
dictator
a
the
whigs
are
unwilling
to
be
distanced
this
way
and
therefore
design
a
present
to
the
same
cato
very
speedily
in
the
meantime
they
are
getting
ready
as
good
a
sentence
as
the
former
on
their
side
so
betwixt
them
it
is
probable
that
cato
as
garth
expressed
it
may
have
something
to
live
upon
after
he
dies
footnote
a
it
is
suggested
by
macaulay
that
lord
bolingbroke
hinted
at
the
attempt
which
marlborough
had
made
to
convert
the
into
a
patent
office
to
be
held

himself

amusing
example

the
stealing
of

the
clever
tories

rÃ´le
did

play
in
this
first
performance
of
cato
that
to
many
in
the
house
the
merits
of
the
actors
must
have
passed
unrecognised
and
yet
those
merits
were
striking
who
could
have
made
a
lovlier
marcia
than
did
nance
and
how
thoroughly
she
must
have
justified
the
passion
of
that
most
virtuous
of
princes
the
sententious
juba
the
character
was
not
worthy
of
her
genius
but
that
did
not
prevent
this
true
artist
from
giving
to
it
all
manner
of
dignity
and
beauty
who
could
help
pitying
her
lover
when
marcia
first
repelled
his
amorous
advances
i
should
be
griev
young
prince
to
think
my
presence
unbent
your
thoughts
and
slacken
to
arms
while
warm
with
slaughter
our
victorious
foe
threatens
aloud
and
calls
you
to
the
field
and
when
marcia
having
sent
away
the
youth
explained
his
air
his
voice
his
looks
and
honest
soul
speak
all
so
movingly
in
his
behalf
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
hear
him
talk
the
apology
came
with
such
delicious
grace
and
plaintiveness
that
the
house
forgot
her
coldness
in
sorrow
for
her
woes
and
barton
booth
his
superb
acting
of
cato
raised
him
to
such
an
airy
pinnacle
of
fame
that
he
soon
became
one
of
the
managers
of
drury
lane
the
other
players
were
evidently
all
more
or
less
effective
barring
cibber
whose
syphax
the
numidian
warrior
who
seeks
the
downfall
of
cato
must
have
made
the
judicious
grieve
indeed
we
can
easily
believe
that
he
used
so
many
grotesque
motions
and
spoke
his
lines
with
such
a
cracked
voice
as
to
win
only
ridicule
and
a
loud
laugh
of
contempt
lord
bolingbroke
gift
of
fifty
guineas
had
a
disturbing
effect
not
only
on
the
whigs
but
on
manager
dogget
as
well
that
worthy
feared
the
success
of
cato
would
cause
booth
to
claim
a
share
in
the
direction
of
drury
lane
as
he
did
of
course
in
a
very
short
time
in
the
hopes
of
shutting
off
all
pretensions
to
this
honour
by
a
paltry
expedient
dogget
thought
that
cibber
wilks
and
himself
as
joint
managers
could
relieve
themselves
of
every
obligation
by
duplicating
the
generosity
of
the
tory
statesman
he
insinuated
to
us
for
he
was
a
staunch
whig
relates
colley
that
this
present
of
fifty
guineas
was
a
sort
of
tory
triumph
which
they
had
no
pretence
to
and
that
for
his
part
he
could
not
bear
that
so
redoubted
a
champion
for
liberty
as
cato
should
be
bought
off
to
the
cause
of
a
contrary
party
he
therefore
in
the
seeming
zeal
of
his
heart
proposed
that
the
managers
themselves
should
make
the
same
present
to
booth
which
had
been
made
him
from
the
boxes
the
day
before
this
he
said
would
recommend
the
equality
and
liberal
spirit
of
our
management
to
the
town
and
might
be
a
means
to
secure
booth
more
firmly
in
our
interest
it
never
having
been
known
that
the
skill
of
the
best
actor
had
received
so
round
a
reward
or
gratuity
in
one
day
before
wilks
who
wanted
nothing
but
abilities
to
be
reduc
to
tell
him
that
it
was
my
opinion
that
booth
would
never
be
made
easy
by
anything
we
could
do
for
him
he
had
a
share
in
the
profits
and
management
and
that
as
he
did
not
want
friends
to
assist
him
whatever
his
merit
might
be
before
every
one
would
think
since
his
acting
of
cato
he
had
now
enough
to

his
pretentions

it

cibber
objections
were
overruled
and
the

night
booth
had
the
fifty
guineas
which
he
receiv
with
a
thankfulness
that
made
wilks
and
dogget
perfectly
easy
insomuch
that
they
for
some
time
to
triumph
in
their
conduct
and
often
endeavour
to
laugh
my
jealousy
out
of
countenance
but
in
the
following
winter
the
game
happened
to
take
a
different
turn
and
then
if
it
had
been
a
laughing
matter
says
colley
i
had
as
strong
an
occasion
to
smile
at
their
former
security
a

a
after
booth
was
admitted
into
the
management
dogget
retired
in
disgust
from
drury
lane
and
brought
suit
against
his
former
associates
he
was
decreed
the
sum
of
for
his
share
in
the
patent
with
allowances
for
interest
i
desir
wrote
cibber
we
might
all
enter
into
an
immediate
treaty
with
booth
upon
the
terms
of
his
admission
dogget
still
sullenly
reply
that
he
had
no
occasion
to
enter
into
any
treaty
wilks
then
to
soften
him
propos
that
if
i
liked
it
dogget
might
undertake
it
himself
i
agreed
no
he
would
not
be
concern
in
it
i
then
offer
the
same
trust
to
wilks
if
dogget
approv
of
it
wilks
said
he
was
not
good
at
making
of
bargains
but
if
i
was
willing
he
would
rather
leave
it
to
me
dogget
at
this
rose
up
and
said
we
might
both
do
as
we
pleas
but
that
nothing
but
the
law
should
make
him
part
with
his
property
and
so
went
out
of
the
room
so
much
for
one
result
of
first
performance
the
play
had
a
run
of
nights
and
as
cunning
as
dogget
was
so
with
the
proposal
that
he
long
that
moment
to
make
booth
the
present
with
his
own
hands
and
though
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
do
it
without
my
consent
had
no
patience
to
ask
it
upon
which
i
turned
to
dogget
with
a
cold
smile
what
a
freezing
polar
expression
cibber
could
put
on
when
he
desired
and
told
him
that
if
booth
could
be
purchas
at
so
cheap
a
rate
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
proofs
of
his
economy
we
had
ever
been
beholden
to
i
therefore
desired
we
might
have
a
little
patience
that
our
doing
it
too
hastily
might
be
only
making
sure
of
an
occasion
to
throw
the
fifty
guineas
away
for
if
we
should
be
obliged
to
do
better
for
him
we
could
never
expect
that
booth
would
think
himself
bound
in
honour
to
refund
them
from
this
little
conversation
we
see
that
art
is
not
always
the
one
beacon
light
of
the
player
or
the
manager
cibber
argued
with
his
natural
shrewdness
but
wilks
would
not
be
convinced
and
began
with
his
usual
freedom
of
speech
to
treat
the
suggestion
as
a
pitiful
evasion
of
their
intended
generosity
but
dogget
who
was
not
so
wide
of
my
meaning
clapping
his
hand
upon
mine
said
with
an
air
of
security
o
do
trouble
yourself
there
must
be
two
words
to
that
bargain
let
me
alone
to
manage
that
matter
wilks
upon
this
dark
discourse
grew
uneasy
as
if
there
were
some
secret
between
us
that
he
was
to
be
left
out
of
therefore
to
avoid
the
shock
of
his
intemperance
i
was
the
town
crowded
to
the
theatre
even
the
good
queen
who
must
have
been
more
or
less
bored
at
the
fuss
bestowed
upon
it
actually
suggested
that
addison
should
dedicate
the
tragedy
to
her
royal
self
to
inscribe
a
work
to
a
sovereign
means
little
or
nothing
in
these
days
of
republicanism
real
or
assumed
but
anne
request
came
as
a
great
compliment
it
was
a
compliment
however
which
had
to
be
dispensed
with
for
addison
had
already
proposed
to
dedicate
to
the
duchess
of
marlborough
and
he
harboured
no
wish
to
mortify
the
aggressive
sarah
now
out
of
favour
with
the
queen
by
acting
upon
the
hint
of
her
friend
and
mistress
so
the
author
diplomatically
ignored
both
horns
of
the
dilemma
or
in
other
words
determined
to
consecrate
his
tragedy
neither
to
queen
nor
duchess
when
june
was
well
nigh
ended
the
drury
lane
players
transplanted
cato
to
the
scholarly
environment
of
oxford
where
as
friend
cibber
tells
us
a
great
deal
of
that
false
flashy
wit
and
forc
humour
which
had
been
the
delight
of
london
was
rated
at
its
bare
intrinsick
value
the
play
was
admirably
suited
to
the
temper
of
a
university
audience
and
its
success
proved
so
great
its
sentiment
so
uplifted
that
sandridge
dean
of
carlisle
wrote
to
barton
booth
expressing
his
wish
that
all
discourses
from
the
pulpit
were
as
instructive
and
edifying
as
pathetic
and
affecting
as
those
provided
by
addison
the
apology
gives
us
an
interesting
account
of
the
favour
accorded
to
cato
above
all
other
modern
plays
by
the
dwellers
in
thoughtful
oxford
the
only
distinguished
merit
allow
to
any
modern
writer
was
to
the
author
of
which
play
being
the
flower
of
a
plant
raised
in
that
learned
garden
for
there
addison
had
his
education
what
favour
may
we
not
suppose
was
due
to
him
from
an
audience
of
brethren
who
from
that
local
relation
to
him
might
naturally
have
a
warmer
pleasure
in
their
benevolence
to
his
fame
but
not
to
give
more
weight
to
this
imaginary
circumstance
than
it
may
bear
the
fact
was
that
on
our
first
day
of
acting
it
our
house
was
in
a
manner
invested
and
entrance
demanded
by
twelve
a
clock
at
noon
and
before
one
it
was
not
wide
enough
for
many
who
came
too
late
for
places
the
same
crowds
continued
for
three
days
together
an
uncommon
curiosity
in
that
place
and
the
death
of
cato
triumphed
over
the
injuries
of
caesar
everywhere
to
conclude
our
reception
at
oxford
whatever
our
merit
might
be
exceeded
our
expectation
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
drury
lane
posted
away
from
oxford
in
a
blaze
of
glory
they
had
actually
behaved
themselves
these
despised
mummers
and
their
contribution
towards
the
repairing
of
a
church
was
almost
sufficient
to
bring
them
within
the
pale

the

fifty
pounds
besides
which
each

had
to
his

one
hundred

which

for

have
made

i
am
from
my
own

thoroughly
convinced
that
wilks
had
no

what
arose
from
the

in

was
trouble

demanded

a
delightful
story
of
dear
old
sir
roger
de
coverley
experience
with
the
distressed
mother
sir
roger
it
appears
confessed
that
he
had
not
seen
a
play
for
twenty
years
and
was
very
anxious
to
know
who
this
distressed
mother
was
and
upon
hearing
that
she
was
hector
widow
he
told
me
that
her
husband
was
a
brave
man
and
that
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
he
had
read
his
life
at
the
end
of
the
dictionary
a
so
the
old
gentleman
accompanied
by
the
captain
sentry
and
a
retinue
of
servants
set
out
in
state
for
drury
lane
and
on
arriving
there
went
into
the
pit
footnote
a
no
as
soon
as
the
house
was
full
and
the
candles
lighted
my
old
friend
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
with
that
pleasure
which
a
mind
seasoned
with
humanity
naturally
feels
in
itself
at
the
sight
of
a
multitude
of
people
who
seem
pleased
with
one
another
and
partake
of
the
same
common
entertainment
i
could
not
but
fancy
to
myself
as
the
old
man
stood
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pit
that
he
made
a
very
proper
centre
to
a
tragic
audience
upon
the
entering
of
pyrrhus
the
knight
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
the
king
of
france
himself
had
a
better
strut
i
was
indeed
very
attentive
to
my
old
friend
remarks
because
i
looked
upon
them
as
a
piece
of
natural
criticism
and
was
well
pleased
to
hear
him
at
the
conclusion
of
almost
every
scene
telling
me
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
play
would
end
one
while
he
appeared
much
concerned
for
andromache
and
a
little
while
after
for
hermione
and
was
extremely
puzzled
to
think
what
would
become
of
pyrrhus
when
sir
roger
saw
andromache
obstinate
refusal
to
her
lovers
importunities
he
whispered
me
in
the
ear
that
he
was
sure
she
would
never
have
him
to
which
he
added
with
a
more
than
ordinary
vehemence
ca
imagine
sir
what
it
is
to
have
to
do
with
a
widow
upon
pyrrhus
threatening
afterwards
to
leave
her
the
knight
shook
his
head
and
muttered
to
himself
do
if
you
can
this
part
dwelt
so
much
upon
my
friend
imagination
that
at
the
close
of
the
third
act
as
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
whispered
me
in
my
ear
widows
sir
are
the
most
perverse
creatures
in
the
world
but
pray
says
he
that
are
a
critic
is
the
play
according
to
your
dramatic
rules
as
you
call
them
should
your
people
in
tragedy
always
talk
to
be
understood
why
there
is
not
a
single
sentence
in
this
play
that
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
act
very
luckily
began
before
i
had
time
to
give
the
old
gentleman
an
answer
says
the
knight
sitting
down
with
great
satisfaction
suppose
we
are
now
to
see
hector
ghost
he
then
renewed
his
attention
and
from
time
to
time
fell
a
praising
the
widow
he
made
indeed
a
little
mistake
as
to
one
of
her
pages
whom
at
his
first
entering
he
took
for
astyanax
but
quickly
set
himself
right
in
that
particular
though
at
the
same
time
he
owned
he
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
seen
the
little
boy
who
says
he
must
needs
be
a
very
fine
child
by
the
account
that
is
given
of
him
upon
hermione
going
off
with
a
menace
to
pyrrhus
the
audience
gave
a
loud
clap
to
which
sir
roger
added
my
word
a
notable
young
baggage
we
can
imagine
sir
roger
going
a
year
later
to
see
oldfield
carry
all
before
her
as
jane
shore
in
nicholas
rowe
play
of
that
name
the
author
had
once
been
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
glacierlike
but
lovely
bracegirdle
at
whose
haughty
shrine
he
long
worshipped
in
the
hopes
that
the
ice
of
her
reserve
might
some
day
melt
and
the
wits
of
the
were
wont
to
say
not
without
a
grain
of
truth
that
when
the
poet
wrote
dramas
to
fit
bracegirdle
as
the
heroine
the
lovers
therein
always
pleaded
his
own
passion
a
now
that
the
charmer
had
left
the
stage
rowe
was
forced
to
entrust
the
title
character
of
jane
shore
to
nance
who
vowed
no
doubt
she
was
thoroughly
bored
at
having
to
walk
once
again
through
a
vale
of
tears
but
she
made
another
triumph
the
author
himself
coached
her
in
the
part
and
helped
to
give
the
production
all
manner
of
success
footnote
a
as
cibber
says
bracegirdle
inspired
the
best
authors
to
write
for
her
and
two
of
them
rowe
and
congreve
when
they
gave
her
a
lover
in
a
play
seem
palpably
to
plead
their
own
passions
and
make
their
private
court
to
her
in
fictitious
characters
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
writing
of
the
tragedy
was
indirectly
due
to
political
disappointment
rowe
had
set
himself
assiduously
to
the
study
of
spanish
with
the
idea
of
securing
from
lord
halifax
a
diplomatic
position
and
his
reward
for
this
energy
was
so
intangible
that
he
soon
gave
up
hopes
of
foreign
travel
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
tribulations
of
jane
in
other
words
the
noble
halifax
merely
expressed
his
satisfaction
that
rowe
could
now
read
don
quixote
in
the
original
thus
nance
played
on
sometimes
in
comedy
and
again
in
tragedy
when
despite
her
customary
objections
the
pages
had
to
drag
her
train
about
it
was
a
train
that
swept
all
before
it
the
speaking
of
trains
and
pages
suggests
the
fact
that
in
old
times
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
tragedy
always
wore
either
in
peculiarity
of
dress
or
pomp
of
surroundings
the
badge
of
greatness
nowadays
a
few
bars
of
romantic
music
to
usher
these
characters
on
the
stage
will
suffice
but
things
were
different
then
our
ancestors
insisted
that
the
aforesaid
should
be
labelled
frilled
and
furbelowed
addison
has
an
interesting
essay
on
the
subject
a
footnote
a
no
but
among
all
our
tragic
artifices
he
says
i
am
the
most
offended
at
those
which
are
made
use
of
to
inspire
us
with
magnificent
ideas
of
the
persons
that
speak
the
ordinary
method
of
making
an
hero
is
to
clap
a
huge
plume
of
feathers
upon
his
head
which
rises
so
very
high
that
there
is
often
a
greater
length
from
his
chin
to
the
top
of
his
head
than
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
one
would
believe
that
we
thought
a
great
man
and
a
tall
man
the
same
thing
this
very
much
embarrasses
the
actor
who
is
forced
to
hold
his
neck
extremely
stiff
and
steady
all
the
while
he
speaks
and
notwithstanding
any
anxieties
which
he
pretends
for
his
mistress
his
country
or
his
friends
one
may
see
by
his
action
that
his
greatest
care
and
concern
is
to
keep
the
plume
of
feathers
from
falling
off
his
head
for
my
own
part
when
i
see
a
man
uttering
his
complaints
under
such
a
mountain
of
feathers
i
am
apt
to
look
upon
him
rather
as
an
unfortunate
lunatic
than
a
distressed
hero
as
these
superfluous
ornaments
upon
the
head
make
a
great
man
a
princess
generally
receives
her
grandeur
from
those
additional
encumbrances
that
fall
into
her
tail
i
mean
the
broad
sweeping
train
that
follows
her
in
all
her
motions
and
finds
constant
employment
for
a
boy
who
stands
behind
her
to
open
and
spread
it
to
advantage
i
do
not
know
how
others
are
affected
at
this
sight
but
i
must
confess
my
eyes
are
wholly
taken
up
with
the
page
part
and
as
for
the
queen
i
am
not
so
attentive
to
any
thing
she
speaks
as
to
the
right
adjusting
of
her
train
lest
it
should
chance
to
trip
up
her
heels
or
incommode
her
as
she
walks
to
and
fro
upon
the
stage
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
very
odd
spectacle
to
see
a
queen
venting
her
passion
in
a
disordered
motion
and
a
little
boy
taking
care
all
the
while
that
they
do
not
ruffle
the
tail
of
her
gown
the
parts
that
the
two
persons
act
on
the
stage
at
the
same
time
are
very
different
the
princess
is
afraid
lest
she
should
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
king
her
father
or
lose
the
hero
her
lover
whilst
her
attendant
is
only
concerned
lest
she
should
entangle
her
feet
in
her
petticoat
in
a
succeeding
paragraph
the
reader
finds
that
a
cherished
custom
the
representing
of
a
vast
army
by
the
employment
of
unpainted
supers
has
at
least
the
sanction
of
age
another
mechanical
method
of
making
great
men
and
adding
dignity
to
kings
and
queens
is
to
accompany
them
with
halberts
and
two
or
three
shifters
of
scenes
with
the
two
make
up
a
complete
body
of
guards
upon
the
english
stage
and
by
the
addition
of
a
few
porters
dressed
in
red
coats
can
represent
above
a
dozen
legions
i
have
sometimes
seen
a
couple
of
armies
drawn
up
together
upon
the
stage
when
the
poet
has
been
disposed
to
do
honour
to
his
generals
it
is
impossible
for
the
reader
imagination
to
multiply
twenty
men
into
such
prodigious
multitudes
or
to
fancy
that
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
soldiers
are
fighting
in

room

fifty
yards

the

often
contribute
to

which
holds
good
now
and
he
ends
his

with
the
belief
that
a
good
poet
will
give
the
reader
a
more
lively
idea
of
an
army
or
a
battle
in
a
description
than
if
he
actually
saw
them
drawn
up
in
squadrons
and
battalions
or
engaged
in
the
confusion
of
a
fight
our
minds
should
be
open
to
great
conceptions
and
inflamed
with
glorious
sentiments
by
what
the
actor
speaks
more
than
by
what
he
appears
can
all
the
trappings
or
equipage
of
a
king
or
hero
give
brutus
half
the
pomp
and
majesty
which
he
receives
from
a
few
lines
in

is
all
very
true
yet
the

will
continue
popular
no

the

the
stupid
sophonisba
of
james
thomson
who
could
write
delightful
poetry
about
nature
without
being
able
to
carry
any
of
that
nature
into
the
art
of
it
was
in
this
artificial
tragedy
that
the
famous
line
occurred
oh
sophonisba
sophonisba
o
which
was
afterwards
parodied
by
oh
jemmy
thomson
jemmy
thomson
oh
and
it
was
in
the
same
compilation
that
cibber
had
the
distinction
of
being
hissed
off
the
stage
the
latter
unlike
oldfield
had
a
sneaking
fondness
for
tragedy
and
when
sophonisba
was
first
read
in
the
green
room
he
appropriated
to
his
own
use
the
dignified
character
of
scipio
his
egotism
and
foolishness
had
their
full
reward
for
two
nights
successively
as
davies
tells
us
cibber
was
as
much
exploded
as
any
bad
actor
could
be
williams
by
desire
of
wilks
made
himself
master
of
the
part
but
he
marching
slowly
in
great
military
distinction
from
the
upper
part
of
the
stage
and
wearing
the
same
dress
as
cibber
was
mistaken
for
him
and
met
with
repeated
hisses
joined
to
the
music
of
notice
ye
of
that
the
is
not
the
invention
of
the
modern
gallery
god
but
as
soon
as
the
audience
were
undeceived
they
converted
their
groans
and
hisses
to
loud
and
long
continued
applause
three
years
later
in
cibber
retired
from
the
stage
with
oldfield
the
picture
was
far
different
she
could
not
make
of
thomson
tragedy
a
success
yet
she
played
sophonisba
one
of
the
last
parts
in
which
she
was
ever
seen
with
a
grandeur
of
effect
that
well
earned
the
undying
gratitude
of
the
author
a
in
after
years
her
old
admirers
were
wont
to
thrill
with
pleasure
as
they
recalled
the
passionate
intensity
she
gave
to
that
line
not
one
base
word
of
carthage
for
thy
soul
as
she
stood
glaring
at
the
astonished
massinissa
footnote
a
oldfield
in
the
character
of
sophonisba
has
excelled
what
even
in
the
fondness
of
an
author
i
could
either
wish
or
imagine
the
grace
dignity
and
happy
variety
of
her
action
have
been
universally
applauded
and
are
truly
thomson
among
those
who
saw
sophonisba
was
chetwood
whose
general
history
of
the
stage
gives
us
many
a
charming
glimpse
of
dead
and
gone
actors
dead
and
gone
nay
rather
let
it
be
said
that
they
still
live
in
the
ever
fresh
and
graphic
pages
of
contemporary
critics
and
thus
refute
the
gentle
pessimism
of
henley
when
he
asks
so
gracefully
where
are
the
passions
they
essayed
and
where
the
tears
they
made
to
flow
where
the
wild
humours
they
portrayed
for
laughing
worlds
to
see
and
know
othello
wrath
and
juliet
woe
sir
peter
whims
and
timon
gall
and
millamant
and
romeo
into
the
night
go
one
and
all
i
was
too
young
says
chetwood
to
view
her
first
dawn
on
the
stage
but
yet
had
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
her
meridian
lustre
a
glow
of
charms
not
to
be
beheld
but
with
a
trembling
eye
which
held
her
influence
till
set
in
night
of
nance
tendency
to
escape
tragic
plays
the
same
writer
tells
us
when
was
revived
it
was
with
much
difficulty
she
was
prevail
upon
to
take
the
part
but
she
perform
it
to
the
utmost
length
of
perfection
and
after
that
she
seem
much
better
reconcil
to
tragedy
what
a
majestical
dignity
in
cleopatra
and
indeed
in
every
part
that
required
it
such
a
finish
figure
on
the
stage
was
never
yet
seen
in
the
fair
penitent
she
was
inimitable
in
the
third
act
with
horatio
when
she
tears
the
letter
with
atoms
thus
thus
let
me
tear
the
vile
detested
falsehood
the
wicked
lying
evidence
of
shame
her
excellent
clear
voice
of
passion
with
manner
and
action
suiting
us
to
make
me
shrink
with
awe
and
seem
to
put
her
monitor
horatio
into
a
mousehole
i
almost
gave
him
up
for
a
troublesome
puppy
and
though
booth
play
the
part
of
lothario
i
could
hardly
lug
him
up
to
the
importance
of
triumphing
over
such
a
finish
piece
of
perfection
that
seemed
to
be
too
much
dignified
to
lose
her
virtue
perhaps
the
reader
may
think
that
this
chapter
like
several
others
is
as
the
said
of
hamlet
too
deuced
full
of
quotation
yet
what
can
give
a
better
picture
of
old
stage
life
than
these
quaint
and
often
eloquent
records
of
the
past
pray
be
lenient
therefore
thou
kindly
critic
if
the
most
faded
books
of
the
theatrical
library
are
taken
down
from
the
dusty
shelf
and
a
few
of
the
neglected
pages
are
printed
once
again
as
these
very
books
seem
all
the
better
in
their
dingy
bindings
so
do
the
old
ideas
the
odd
conceits
the
stories
that
charmed
dead
generations
take
on
a
keener
zest
when
clothed
in
the
formal
language
of
other
days
if
we
want
to
get
that
formal
language
in
all
its
glory
let
us
bring
from
the
library
a
copy
of
some
early
tragedy
shall
we
close
our
eyes
and
choose
one
at
random
well
what
have
we
the
tamerlane
of
our
friend
nicholas
rowe
in
which
is
set
forth
the
story
of
the
generous
emperor
of
tartary
the
very
glass
and
fashion
of
all
conquerors
the
play
is
prefaced
by
a
fulsome
epistle
dedicatory
addressed
to
the
sacred
person
of
the
right
honourable
william
lord
marquis
of
harrington
and
showing
almost
pathetically
how
frequently
the
literary
workers
of
queen
golden
age
were
wont
to
beg
the
influence
of
some
powerful
patron
the
dedication
seems
absolutely
grovelling
when
viewed
from
the
present
standards
but
rowe
and
his
friends
saw
therein
nothing
more
remarkable
than
respectful
homage
to
one
of
the
world
great
men
the
republic
of
letters
was
then
an
empty
name
a
footnote
a
tamerlane
was
brought
out
in
with
betterton
in
the
title
rÃ´le
the
author
of
tamerlane
fears
that
in
thus
calling
attention
to
the
play
he
may
appear
guilty
of
impertinence
and
interruptions
and
he
adds
i
am
sure
it
is
a
reason
why
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
with
this
tragedy
not
but
that
poetry
has
always
been
and
will
still
be
the
entertainment
of
all
wise
men
that
have
any
delicacy
in
their
knowledge
then
after
wasting
a
little
necessary
flattery
on
the
noble
marquis
he
starts
off
into
an
unblushing
eulogy
of
king
william
whose
clemency
was
mirrored
supposedly
by
the
hero
of
the
tragedy
some
people
who
do
me
a
very
great
honour
in
it
have
fancy
that
in
the
person
of
tamerlane
i
have
alluded
to
the
greatest
character
of
the
present
age
i
know
whether
i
ought
not
to
apprehend
a
great
deal
of
danger
from
avowing
a
design
like
that
it
may
be
a
task
indeed
worthy
of
the
greatest
genius
which
this
or
any
other
time
has
produc
but
therefore
i
ought
not
to
stand
the
shock
of
a
parallel
lest
it
should
be
seen
to
my
disadvantage
how
far
the
has
transcended
the
poet
and
so
on
to
turn
the
leaves
of
the
play
after
wading
through
the
slime
of
the
epistle
is
to
find
amusing
proof
of
the
and
at
times
bombastic
expression
which
elicited
such
admiration
from
audiences
of
the
old
do
not
laugh
at
it
reader
you
tolerate
an
equal
amount
of
absurdity
in
modern
melodrama
the

first

are
charmingly
suggestive
of
the
starched
and
stately
past

to

the

just
why
the
orb
of
day
had
to
be
saluted
with
such
frequency
no
one
seemed
able
to
determine
but
the
honour
was
continually
bestowed
to
the
great
edification
of
the
groundlings
when
young
wrote

paid
so
much
attention
to

and
wrote
that
the
author
of

extremely
anxious
to
prevent
the
blushing

any
indecent
object
and
therefore
on
all
such
occasions
he
addresses
himself
to
the
sun
and
desires
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
after
the

to

hear
something
fulsome
about
the
virtues
of
king
william

no
lust
of

the
common
vice
of
kings
no
furious
zeal

to
redress
an

people

to
save
the

from
the
strong
oppressor
is
all
his
end
of
war
and
when
he
draws
the
sword
to
punish
like
relenting
he
seems
unwilling
to
deface
his
kind
a
few
lines
later
and
we
find
one
of
the
characters
drawing
a
parallel
between

augustus
thomas
writing
a
play
wherein
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
brought
into
such
irreverent
contact
with
the
deity
a
footnote
a
yet
it
can
not
be
easily
forgotten
that
a
certain
clergyman
preaching
several
years
ago
at
the
funeral
of
a
rich
man
son
compared
the
poor
boy
to
christ
and
this
very
ecclesiastic
probably
looks
upon
the
stage
as
a
monument
of
sacrilegiousness
but
we
need
not
follow
the
platitudes
of
tamerlane
and
his
companions
nor
weep
at
the
sententious
wickedness
of
bajazet
that
ungrateful
sovereign
typifying
louis

of

and

royal
hater

it
not

strange
to
apply
the

old

noun
so
redolent
of

privacy
to
the
feverish

of

go

approvingly
as
they
pass
from

we
are
that

no
existence
apart
from
the

we
are
pleased
to
applaud

some

that

therefore

full

not

there
is
such

sometimes
in

extreme
indigence
that

could
not
pay
for

so
that
they
have
wandered
together
whole
nights
in

streets

in
these
almost
incredible
scenes
of
distress
we
may
suppose
that
savage
mentioned
many
of
the
anecdotes
with
which
johnson
afterwards
enriched
the
life
of
this
unhappy
companion
and
those
of

told
sir
joshua
reynolds
that
one
night
in

walked
round
james

for

of

they
were
not
at
all
depressed
by
their
situation

in
high
spirits

brimful
of
patriotism
traversed
the

for
several
hours
inveighed
against
the

and
resolved
they
would

their
the
claim
of
savage
that
he
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
countess
of
macclesfield
a
claim
which
he
was
always
asserting
to
the
point
of
coarseness
seems
to
have
been
the
of
this
life
there
never
was
proof
that
the
relationship
which
he
thus
flaunted
really
existed
for
although
the
conduct
of
the
countess
a
was
unpardonable
the
poet
could
never
show
that
he
had
been
the
mysterious
infant
which
had
this

for

the

footnote
a
in
this
johnson
life
of
savage
is
related
that
oldfield
was
very
fond
of
savage
conversation
and
allowed
him
an
annuity
during
her
life
of
these
facts
are
equally
there
was
no
foundation
for
them
that
misfortunes
pleaded
for
pity
and
had
the
desired
effect
on
oldfield
compassion
is
certain
but
she
so
much
disliked
the
man
and
disapproved
his
conduct
that
she
never
admitted
him
to
her
conversation
nor
suffered
him
to
enter
her
house
she
indeed
often
relieved
him
with
such
donations
as
spoke
her
generous
disposition
but
this
was
on
the
solicitation
of
friends
who
frequently
set
his
calamities
before
her
in
the
most
piteous
light
and
from
a
principle
of
humanity
she
became
not
a
little
instrumental
in
saving
his
cibber
lives
of
the
poets
savage
himself
once
turned
player
and
no
one
must
have
been
more
amused
thereat
than
the
oldfield
it
happened
during
the
summer
of
when
the
poet
who
was
in
his
customary
state
of
theatrical
destitution
determined
to
replenish
his
shabby
purse
by
bringing
out
a
tragedy
while
this
play
the
tragedy
of
sir
thomas
overbury
a
was
in
rehearsal
at
drury
lane
colley
cibber
kept
the
author
in
clothes
and
the
laureate
son
theophilus

a
very
young
man
studied

of
somerset
the
principal
actors
were
not
in
london
just
then
it
being
the
off
season
when
the
younger
players
strutted
across
the
classic
boards
of
the
house
and
savage
determined
himself
to
enact
sir
thomas
he
did
so
with
melancholy
results
even
johnson
admits
the
failure
of
so
presumptuous
a
leap
before
the
footlights
for
neither
his
voice
look
nor
gesture
were
such
as
were
expected
on
the
stage
and
he
was
so
much
ashamed
of
having
been
reduced
to
appear
as
a
player
that
he
always
blotted
out
his
name
from
the
list
when
a
copy
of
his
tragedy
was
to
be
shown
to
his
friends
b
footnote
a
savage
with
his
usual
bad
taste
published
this
tragedy
as
the
work
of
richard
savage
of
the
late
earl
footnote
b
in
the
publication
of
his
performance
he
was
more
successful
for
the
rays
of
genius
that
glimmered
in
it
that
glimmered
through
all
the
mists
which
poverty
and
cibber
had
been
able
to
spread
over
it
procured
him
the
notice
and
esteem
of
many
persons
eminent
for
their
rank
their
virtue

of
this
play
acted

the
accumulated
profits
arose
to
an
hundred
pounds
which
he
thought
at
that
time
a
very
large
sum
having
been
never
master
of
so
much
before
in
the
dedication
for
which
he
received
ten
guineas
there
is
nothing
remarkable
the
preface
contains
a
very
liberal
enconium
on
the
blooming
excellence
of
theophilus
cibber
which
savage
could
not
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
see
his
friends
about
to
read
without
snatching
the
play
out
of
their
dr
johnson
what
a
sublime
hypocrite
our
richard
was
to
be
sure
that
he
felt
so
keenly
the
disgrace
of
having
been
reduced
to
appear
as
a
player
was
no
doubt
a
sentiment
intended
for
the
exclusive
ear
of
the
great
lexicographer
whose
prejudice
against
the
stage
and
its
followers
was
strong
to
the
point
of
absurdity
despite
the
qualms
of
the
poet
over
exposing
his
sacred
self
to
the
gaze
of
an
audience
he
had
no
sensitiveness
in
receiving
the
money
of
an
actress
and
he
was
willing
enough
to
have
her
aid
in
another
direction
that
aid
was
cheerfully
given
once
upon
a
time
when
savage
came
dangerously
near
the
scaffold
this
prince
of
scamps
and
wanderer
among
the
beery
precincts
of
happened
to
stroll
one
night
accompanied
by
two
choice
spirits
and
himself
full
of
spirits
into
a
disreputable
near
charing
cross
the
three
men
rudely
pushed
their
way
into
a
parlour
where
some
other
roisterers
were
drinking
the
intrusion
was
naturally
resented
and
as
each
and
every
one
of
the
party
chanced
to
be
better
filled
with
wine
than
with
politeness
a
brawl
was
the
consequence
swords
were
drawn
and
savage
killed
a
sinclair
after
which
drunken
act
he
cut
the
head
of
a
barmaid
who
tried
to
hold
him
then
more
swearing
shrieking
and
a
cry
for
soldiers
a
flight
from
the
and
an
almost
instant
arrest
a
pretty
picture
was
it
not
when
savage
was
put
on
trial
for
his
life
he
pleaded
that
the
killing
of
sinclair
was
done
in
and
his
acquittal
would
probably
have
followed
but
for
the
shrewdness
of
the
prosecution
this
prosecution
was
conducted
by
francis
page
whose
severity
pope
immortalised
in
the
lines
slander
or
poison
dread
from
delia
rage
or
hanging
if
your
judge
be
page
page
surely
understood
human
nature
or
that
portion
of
it
appertaining
to
the
average
jurymen
and
he
disposed
of
defence
by
one
blow
when
he
said
to
the
good
men
and
true
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
are
to
consider
that
savage
is
a
very
great
man
a
much
greater
man
than
you
or
i
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
he
wears
very
fine
clothes
much
finer
clothes
than
you
or
i
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
he
has
abundance
of
money
in
his
pocket
much
more
money
than
you
or
i
gentlemen
of
the
jury
but
gentlemen
of
the
jury
is
it
not
a
very
hard
case
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
savage
should
therefore
kill
you
or
me
gentlemen
of
the
jury
whereupon
the
defendant
began
to
make
a
speech
in
his
own
behalf
but
his
flow
of
eloquence
was
quenched
by
the
judge
and
the
jury
soon
found
savage
as
well
as
gregory
one
of
his
companions
in
the
drunken
broil
to
be
guilty
of
murder
many
influences
were
now
brought
to
bear
on
queen
caroline
consort
of
george
to
secure
a
pardon
for
the
rascal
but
that
good
lady
was
for
a
time
obdurate
she
had
heard
a
few
choice
stories
anent
the
man
and
among
them
one
which
johnson
glosses
over
in
this
way
savage
when
he
had
discovered
his
birth
had
an
incessant
desire
to
speak
to
his
mother
who
always
avoided
him
in
public
and
refused
him
admission
into
her
house
one
evening
walking
as
it
was
his
custom
in
the
street
that
she
inhabited
he
saw
the
door
of
her
house
by
accident
open
he
entered
it
and
finding
no
person
in
the
passage
to
hinder
him
went
upstairs
to
salute
her
she
discovered
him
before
he
entered
her
chamber
alarmed
the
family
with
the
most
distressful
outcries
and
when
she
had
by
her
screams
gathered
them
about
her
ordered
them
to
drive
out
of
the
house
that
villain
who
had
forced
himself
in
upon
her
and
endeavoured
to
murder
her
savage
who
had
attempted
with
the
most
submissive
tenderness
to
soften
her
rage
hearing
her
utter
so
detestable
an
accusation
thought
it
prudent
to
retire
thus
the
queen
refused
to
interfere
until
the
countess
of
hertford
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
imprisoned
poet
in
the
meantime
mistress
oldfield
interceded
with
the
mighty
robert
walpole
and
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
savage
received
the
king
pardon
a
being
thus
left
free
to
continue
the
persecution
of
his
alleged
mother
to
beg
from
friends
and
strangers
alike
and
to
follow
a
mode
of
life
which
scandalised
even
his
kindly
biographer
and
when
oldfield
the
latchets
of
whose
shoes
he
was
not
worthy
to
tie
played
her
last
part
and
passed
away
from
the
earthly
stage
richard
wore
mourning
for
her
as
for
a
mother
but
did
not
celebrate
her
in
elegies
b
because
he
knew
that
too
great
profusion
of
praise
would
only
have
revived
those
faults
which
his
natural
equity
did
not
allow
him
to
think
less
because
they
were
committed
by
one
who
favoured
him
but
of
which
though
his
virtue
would
not
endeavour
to
palliate
them
his
gratitude
would
not
suffer
him
to
prolong
the
memory
or
diffuse
the
censure
footnote
a
march
it
is
cheerful
to
know
that
gregory
also
escaped
hanging
it
was
contended
during
the
trial
and
afterwards
that
the
testimony
against
both
these
defendants
was
more
damning
than
the
facts
warranted
footnote
b
nevertheless
savage
did
write
a
poem
in
honour
although
he
did
not
sign
his
virtuous
name
thereto
the
verses
are
quoted
by
chetwood
chapter
xi
poor
crusty
samuel
what
rot
you
could
write
now
and
then
and
how
you
did
hate
players
and
their
craft
but
may
not
the
bewildered
reader
ask
how
the
aphorisms
of
the
doctor
and
the
disreputable
affairs
of
savage
concern
that
home
life
of
nance
to
which
the
chapter
is
presumably
consecrated
in
answer
the
writer
can
only
cry
peccavi
and
having
done
so
will
sin
boldly
again
by
giving
one
more
anecdote
the
story
concerns
savage
but
steele
is
the
hero
of
it
and
as
winsome
dick
is
always
welcome
we
may
take
leave
of
the
other
dick
in
a
pleasant
way
savage
was
once
desired
by
sir
richard
says
johnson
with
an
air
of
the
utmost
importance
to
come
very
early
to
his
house
the
next
morning
savage
came
as
he
had
promised
found
the
chariot
at
the
door
and
sir
richard
waiting
for
him
and
ready
to
go
out
what
was
intended
and
whither
they
were
to
go
savage
could
not
conjecture
and
was
not
willing
to
inquire
but
immediately
seated
himself
with
sir
richard
the
coachman
was
ordered
to
drive
and
they
hurried
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
hyde
park
corner
where
they
stopped
at
a
petty
tavern
and
retired
to
a
private
room
sir
richard
then
informed
him
that
he
intended
to
publish
a
pamphlet
and
that
he
had
desired
him
to
come
thither
that
he
might
write
for
him
he
soon
sat
down
to
the
work
sir
richard
dictated
and
savage
wrote
till
the
dinner
that
had
been
ordered
was
put
upon
the
table
savage
was
surprised
at
the
meanness
of
the
entertainment
and
after
some
hesitation
ventured
to
ask
for
wine
which
sir
richard
not
without
reluctance
ordered
to
be
brought
they
then
finished
their
dinner
and
proceeded
in
their
pamphlet
which
they
concluded
in
the
afternoon
savage
then
imagined
his
task
over
and
expected
that
sir
richard
would
call
for
the
reckoning
and
return
home
but
his
expectations
deceived
him
for
sir
richard
told
him
that
he
was
without
money
and
that
the
pamphlet
must
be
sold
before
the
dinner
could
be
paid
for
and
savage
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
and
offer
their
new
production
to
sale
for
two
guineas
which
with
some
difficulty
he
obtained
sir
richard
then
returned
home
having
retired
that
day
only
to
avoid
his
creditors
and
composed
the
pamphlet
only
to
discharge
his
reckoning
savage
also
told
johnson
another
merry
tale
of
careless
dick
sir
richard
steele
having
one
day
invited
to
his
house
a
great
number
of
persons
of
the
first
quality
they
were
surprised
at
the
number
of
liveries
which
surrounded
the
table
and
after
dinner
when
wine
and
mirth
had
set
them
free
from
the
observation
of
a
rigid
ceremony
one
of
them
inquired
of
sir
richard
how
such
an
expensive
train
of
domestics
could
be
consistent
with
his
fortune
sir
richard
very
frankly
confessed
that
they
were
fellows
of
whom
he
would
very
willingly
be
rid
and
being
then
asked
why
he
did
not
discharge
them
declared
that
they
were
bailiffs
who
had
introduced
themselves
with
an
execution
and
whom
since
he
could
not
send
them
away
he
had
thought
it
convenient
to
embellish
with
liveries
that
they
might
do
him
credit
while
they
stayed
his
friends
were
diverted
with
the
expedient
and
by
paying
the
debt
discharged
their
attendants
having
obliged
sir
richard
to
promise
that
they
should
never
again
find
him
graced
with
a
retinue
of
the
same
kind
these
little
pleasantries
are
echoes
of
the
halcyon
days
when
steele
thought
savage
a
very
fine
fellow
made
him
an
allowance
and
even
proposed
to
become
the
poet
but
the
recipient
of
all
this
favour
was
caddish
enough
to
ridicule
his
patron
a
kind
friend
mentioned
the
fact
to
sir
richard
and
the
knight
shut
his
doors
on
the
ingrate
let
us
likewise
give
the
fellow
his
chapter
viii
the
mimic
world
we
have
seen
that
oldfield
affected
to
despise
tragedy
and
was
wont
to
suggest
mistress
porter
as
a
lady
better
suited
than
herself
to
the
purposes
of
and
as
the
present
chapter
will
be
devoted
to
a
few
of
nance
contemporaries
let
us
linger
if
only
for
an
instant
over
the
imposing
memory
of
one
whom
cynical
horace
walpole
thought
even
finer
than
garrick
in
certain
scenes
of
passion
this
ornament
to
human
nature
as
a
biographer
warmly
called
the
porter
played
her
first
childish
part
in
a
lord
mayor
pageant
during
the
reign
of
james
appearing
as
the
genius
of
britain
and
incidentally
falling
under
the
august
notice
of
another
genius
of
britain
the
great
betterton
that
worthy
man
regarded
the
little
girl
with
prophetic
eyes
saw
in
her
a
wealth
of
undeveloped
talent
and
was
soon
instructing
the
chit
in
the
mysteries
of
dramatic
art
sometimes
the
revolted
poor
mite
she
should
have
been
in
the
nursery
the
minx
says
some
practical
reader
and
then
noble
thomas
would
give
vent
to
an
awful
threat
she
must
speak
and
act
as
she
was
directed
or
else
horrible

the
child
should
be
thrown
into
the
basket
of

buried
under
one
of
the

which
hid
the
luscious
fruit
and
with
that
punishment
hanging
over
her
the
novice
went
on
learning
and
originating
until
one
day
london
woke
up
to
find
a
new
tragedienne
within
its
boundaries
illustration
mills
porter
mr
cibber
was
a
tragedienne
be
it
added
who
possessed
no
wonderful
charm
of
person
she
was
pleasing
in
figure
and
bearing
but
her
voice
was
naturally
harsh
her
features
did
not
shine
forth
loveliness
and
when
the
scene
wherein
she
walked
called
neither
for
vehemence
of
feeling
nor
melting
tenderness
her
elocution
became
a
monotonous
cadence
a
yet
in
moments
of
dramatic
excitement
or
in
places
where
the
deep
note
of
pathos
had
to
be
sounded
porter
played
with
a
distinction
that
either
thrilled
the
spectator
or
reduced
him
to
the
verge
of
tears
she
threw
cadence
and
monotony
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
or
rather
to
the
four
corners
of
the
stage
and
spoke
with
the
earnestness
of
one
inspired
footnote
a
porter
was
tall
fair
and
easy
and
dignified
in
action
but
she
was
not
handsome
and
her
voice
had
a
small
degree
of
tremor
moreover
she
imitated
or
rather
faultily
exceeded
barry
in
the
habit
of
prolonging
and
toning
her
pronunciation
sometimes
to
a
degree
verging
upon
a
chant
but
whether
it
was
that
the
public
ear
was
at
that
period
accustomed
to
a
or
that
she
threw
off
the
defect
in
the
heat
of
passion
it
is
certain
that
her
general
judgment
and
genius
in
the
highest
bursts
of
tragedy
inspired
enthusiasm
in
all
around
her
and
that
she
was
thought
to
be
alike
mistress
of
the
terrible
and
the
thomas
campbell
as
queen
catherine
porter
was
all
mournful
grace
and
dignity
as
lady
macbeth
she
breathed
of
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
and
in
the
rÃ´le
of
belvidera
she
showed
yet
another
phase
of
her
incomparable
art
i
remember
porter
to
whom
nature
had
been
so
niggard
in
voice
and
face
so
great
in
many
parts
as
lady
macbeth
alicia
in

hermione
in
the
mother
and
many
parts
of
the
kind
that
her
great
action
eloquence
of
look
and
gesture
moved
astonishment
and
yet
i
have
heard
her
declare
she
left
the
action
to
the
possession
of
the
sentiments
in
the
part
she
performed
thus
wrote
chetwood
whose
good
fortune
it
was
to
see
oldfield
and
porter
and
a

surrendered
for

was

the
best

had
been

to
his

her
at

owned
that
he
was
astonished
at
the
genius
and
power
he
saw
struggling
to
make
itself
felt
through
the
burden
of
uncouth
gestures
and
an
ungraceful
and
slovenly
figure
he
was
generous
enough
to

like
porter
ryan
was
a
youthful
disciple
of
betterton
and
was
brought
to
the
notice
of
roscius
in
a
curious
fashion
one
day
when
lacy
had
just
begun
as
a
boy
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
to
court
the
dramatic
muses
he
was
cast
for
the
rÃ´le
of
seyton
the
old
officer
who
attends
on
macbeth
and
was
no
doubt
charmed
with
the
assignment
to
wait
upon
macbeth
in
however
humble
a
capacity
was
in
itself
no
mean
honour
and
when
the
aforesaid
macbeth
would
be
betterton
himself
the
importance
of
the
task
was
that
afternoon
ryan
came
on
the
stage
in
all
the
glory
of
a
wig
imagine
playing
shakespeare
these
days
with
wigs
and
a
smiling
young
face
being
very
much
pleased
with
himself
and
the
world
in
general
to
betterton
who
had
expected
to
see
in
seyton
a
henchman
of
mature
years
and
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
unconscious
of
lacy
existence
the
appearance
of
the
boy
came
as
a
shock
had
the
witches
of
the
tragedy
been
turned
into
beautiful
children
he
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
however
he
gave
the
new
seyton
an
encouraging
look
and
the
stripling
played
the
part
in
a
way
to
earn
the
approbation
of
the
great
actor
after
the
performance
was
over
betterton
scolded
old
downes
the
prompter
for
sending
a
child
to
him
instead
of
a
man
advanced
in
years
this
anecdote
seems
to
show
that
the
art
of
had
not
reached
perfection
in
those
times
for
a
few
strokes
of
the
pencil
should
have
destroyed
the
juvenile
aspect
of
seyton
it
must
not
be
supposed
nevertheless
that
the
decoration
of
the
face
was
unknown
and
an
entry
in
pepys
delightful
diary
proves
that
of
a
certain
kind
flourished
at
the
restoration
to
the
king
house
says
pepys

there
going

with

took

up
into

the

where
nell

sat
down

gave
us

here
i
read
the
questions
to
knipp
while
she
answered
me
through
all
her
part
of
figarys
which
was
acted
but
lord
to
see
how
they
were
both
painted
would
make
a
man
mad
and
did
make
me
loath
them
and
what
base
company
of
men
comes
among
them
and
how
loudly
they
talk
and
how
poor
the
men
are
in

yet
what
a
show
they
make
on

very
observable

in
his
notes
to
cibber
apology
lowe
suggests
the
plausible
theory
that
young
actors
playing
juveniles
did
not
use
any
or
paint
but
went
on
the
stage
with
their
natural
complexion
he
instances
this
paragraph
from
cibber
the
first
thing
that
enters
into
the
head
of
a
young
actor
is
that
of
being
a
heroe
in
this
ambition
i
was
soon
snubb
by
the
insufficiency
of
my
voice
to
which
might
be
added
an
uniform
meagre
person
tho
then
not
with
a
dismal
pale
complexion
to
leave
the
merry
days
of
charles
ii
and
wander
back
to
those
of
queen
anne
it
may
be
said
that
ryan
made
his
first
success
as
the
marcus
in
the
original
production
of
cato
it
was
a
success
rather
added
to
than
otherwise
by
an
adventure
of
which
this
actor
was
the
unfortunate
victim
in
the
run
of
that
celebrated
tragedy
writes
chetwood
he
was
accidently
brought
into
a
fray
with
some
of
our
tritons
on
the
thames
and
in
the
scuffle
a
blow
on
the
nose
was
given
him
by
one
of
these
who
neither
regard
men
or
manners
i
remember
the
same
night
as
he
was
brought
on
the
bier
after
his
suppos
death
in
the
fourth
act
of
the
blood
from
the
real
wound
in
the
face
gush
out
with
violence
that
hurt
had
no
other
effect
than
just
turning
his
nose
a
little
tho
not
to
deformity
yet
some
people
imagine
it
gave
a
very
small
alteration
to
the
tone
of
his
voice
tho
nothing
disagreeable
and
a
very
good
advertisement
it
was
no
doubt
in
later
years
another
accident
befell
ryan
as
he
was
going
home
from
the
theatre
one
night
the
actor
was
attacked
by
a
footpad
and
received
in
his
face
two
bullets
which
broke
a
portion
of
his
jaw
by
the
help
of
a
lamp
again
is
the
quotation
from
chetwood
the
robber
knew
ryan
as
i
have
been
inform
begg
his
pardon
for
his
mistake
and
ran
off
of
this
hurt
too
he
recover
after
a
long
illness
and
play
with
success
as
before
without
any
seeming
alteration
of
voice
or
face
his
royal
highness
upon
this
accident
was
it
the
prince
of
wales
afterwards
george
ii
sent
him
a
handsome
present
and
others
of
the
nobility
copy
the
laudable
example
of
the
second
illustrious
person
in
the
three
kingdoms
this
was
lacy
ryan
who
in
his
time
played
many
different
parts
among
them
iago
hamlet
macduff
captain
plume
and
orestes
he
was
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
great
actor
but
he
well
adorned
the
station
of
theatrical
life
in
which
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
place
him
and
strutted
his
lengthy
hour
upon
the
stage
with
much
satisfaction
to
his
companions
and
the
public
even
when
ryan
had
to
kill
a
bully
in
it
was
a
fellow
named
kelly
who
loved
to
haunt
the
pick
quarrels
with
peaceable
citizens
and
then
half
murder
them
the
world
looked
on
approvingly
and
averred
that
the
player
had
acted
with
his
usual
conscientiousness
another
contemporary
of
nance
was
benjamin
johnson
a
who
achieved
curiously
enough
some
of
his
greatest
successes
in
the
plays
of
his
namesake
the
other
ben
jonson
he
began
life
as
a
scene
painter
but
afterwards
turned
his
attention
to
the
front
rather
than
the
back
of
the
stage
or
as
he
would
humorously
explain
left
the
occupation
to
take
that
of
a
sinner
johnson
seems
to
have
been
a
man
of
the
world
and
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
life
even
though
he
never
passed
through
the
adventures
of
lacy
ryan
when
he
was
born
betterton
dominated
the
boards
when
he
died
garrick
had
become
the
talk
of
london
and
it
is
probable
that
in
his
latter
years
ben
could
tell
many
a
story
of
interesting
experiences
footnote
a
ben
johnson
excelled
greatly
in
all
his
comedies
then
frequently
acted
he
was
of
all
comedians
the
chastest
and
closest
observer
of
nature
johnson
never
seemed
to
know
that
he
was
before
an
audience
he
drew
his
character
as
the
poet
designed
davies
there
was
one
story
at
least
that
this
actor
used
to
relate
with
much
unction
after
a
visit
which
he
once
paid
to
dublin
the
hero
of
the
affair
was
an
irishman
named
baker
who
relieved
the
monotony
of
his
work
as
a
master
pavior
by
acting
sir
john
falstaff
and
other
parts
when
he
was
in
the
streets
overseeing
the
labours
of
his
men
this
usually
rehearsed
one
of
his
characters
muttering
the
lines
gesticulating
and
almost
forgetting
that
he
was
without
the
sacred
walls
of
a
theatre
the
workmen
soon
got
accustomed
to
these
performances
and
everything
proceeded
with
the
utmost
smoothness
until
one
exciting
day
when
baker
chanced
to
be
alone
with
two
new
paviors
these
recruits
countrymen
from
cheshire
were
much
alarmed
at
a
sudden
change
in
the
demeanour
of
their
master
whose
eyes
began
to
roll
and
lips
to
move
under
the
pressure
of
some
strange
emotion
baker
was
merely
rehearsing
falstaff
but
the
two
men
made
up
their
little
minds
that
he
had
lost
his
head
and
they
felt
quite
sure
that
their
employer
was
a
dangerous
lunatic
when
he
gave
them
a
piercing
glance
and
cried
soft
who
are
you
sir
walter
blunt
there
honour
for
you
no
vanity
i
am
as
hot
as
molten
lead
and
as
heavy
too
god
keep
lead
out
of
me
wauns
blunt
enough
to
take
care
of
you
warrant
you
shouted
one
of
the
workmen
who
had
now
recovered
what
he
presumed
to
be
his
wits
and
thereupon
he
and
his
companion
laid
violent
hands
on
baker
a
crowd
soon
gathered
and
despite
the
indignant
cries
of
the
who
declared
he
was
never
more
sane
this
son
of
thespis
was
tied
hand
and
foot
and
carried
home
in
triumph
with
a
howling
mob
for
attendants
that
ended
baker
rehearsal
for
the
nonce
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
when
next
he
essayed
the
lusty
sir
john
he
made
sure
of
an
appreciative
audience
it
is
a
seductive
occupation
to
delve
into
the
lives
of
these
bygone
players
and
there
is
always
temptation
to
tarry
long
and
lovingly
amid
such
chequered
careers
but
like
poor
joe
of
dickens
we
must
keep
moving
on
and
so
leave
johnson
and
baker
for
another
actor
who
waits
to
strut
across
the
stage
of
these
palmy
days
thomas
elrington
is
the
the
same
elrington
who
sought
to
outshine
the
tragic
barton
booth
without
possessing
either
the
genius
or
the
scholarship
of
that
noble
son
of
melpomene
as
a
boy
thomas
was
apprenticed
by
an
impecunious
father
to
an
upholsterer
in
covent
garden
but
he
cared
more
for
the
theatre
than
for
his
trade
and
was
no
doubt
regarded
by
his
employer
as
a
future
candidate
for
the
gallows
i
remember
when
he
was
an
apprentice
relates
chetwood
we
in
several
private
plays
when
we
were
preparing
to
act
or
hannibal
overthrow
after
i
had
wrote
out
my
part
of
massiva
i
carried
him
the
book
of
the
play
to
study
the
part
of
king
masinissa
i
found
him
finishing
a
velvet
cushion
and
gave
him
the
book
but
alas
before
he
could
secrete
it
his
master
a
hot
voluble
frenchman
came
in
upon
us
and
the
book
was
thrust
under
the
velvet
of
the
cushion
his
master
as
usual
rated
him
for
not
working
with
a
why
a
you
not
vark
tom
and
stood
over
him
so
long
that
i
saw
with
some
mortification
the
book
irrecoverably
stitch
up
in
the
cushion
never
to
be
retriev
till
the
cushion
is
worn
to
pieces
poor
tom
cast
many
a
desponding
look
upon
me
when
he
was
finishing
the
fate
of
the
play
while
every
stitch
went
to
both
our
hearts
his
master
observing
our
looks
turn
to
me
and
with
words
that
broke
their
necks
over
each
other
for
haste
abused
both
of
us
the
most
intelligible
of
his
great
number
of
words
were
jack
pudenges
and
the
like
expressions
of
contempt
but
our
play
was
gone
for
ever
another
time
continues
the
biographer
we
were
so
bold
to
attempt
shakespeare
where
our
tom
had
the
part
of
the
ghost
father
to
young
hamlet
his
armour
was
composed
of
pasteboard
neatly
painted
the
frenchman
had
intelligence
of
what
we
were
about
and
to
our
great
surprise
and
mortification
made
one
of
our
audience
the
ghost
in
its
first
appearance
is
dumb
to
horatio
while
these
scenes
past
the
frenchman
only
muttered
between
his
teeth
and
we
were
in
hopes
his
passion
would
subside
but
when
our
ghost
began
his
first
speech
to
hamlet
me
he
replied
me
vil
marke
you
presently
and
without
saying
any
more
beat
our
poor
ghost
off
the
stage
through
the
street
while
every
stroke
on
the
pasteboard
armour
grieved
the
auditors
because
they
did
not
pay
for
their
seats
insomuch
that
three
or
four
ran
after
the
ghost
and
brought
him
back
in
triumph
with
the
avenging
frenchman
at
his
heels
who
would
not
be
appeas
till
our
ghost
promised
him
never
to
commit
the
offence
of
acting
again
a
promise
made
like
many
others
never
to
be
kept
elrington
ultimately
became
a
favourite
player
with
dublin
audiences
and
then
contested
with
booth
in
the
latter
own
ground
of
london
he
never
equalled
the
classic
barton
yet
made
a
success
in
tragedy
and
was
once
asked
to
join
the
forces
of
drury
lane
for
a
term
of
years
he
told
the
managers
that
he
could
not
think
of
permanently
leaving
ireland
where
he
was
so
well
rewarded
for
his
services
and
added
there
is
not
a
gentleman
house
there
to
which
i
am
not
a
welcome
visitor
which
shows
that
an
actor
can
be
a
snob
like
the
worst
of
us
when
elrington
died
two
years
after
the
taking
off
of
oldfield
his
epitaph
was
written
in
these
flattering
lines
thou
best
of
actors
here
interr
no
more
thy
charming
voice
is
heard
this
grave
thy
corse
contains
thy
better
part
which
us
to
move
our
admiration
and
our
love
has
fled
its
sad
remains
tho
there
no
monumental
brass
thy
sacred
relicks
to
encase
thou
wondrous
man
of
art
a
lover
of
the
muse
divine
o
elrington
shall
be
thy
shrine
and
carve
thee
in
his
heart
one
of
elrington
friends
and
artistic
associates
happened
to
be
john
evans
a
player
possessed
of
talent
fatness
and
indolence
as
adventures
seem
to
be
in
order
in
this
chapter
let
us
recall
two
which
occurred
to
this
gentleman
at
a
time
when
he
was
in
high
favour
with
the
irish
the
first
episode
making
a
warlike
prologue
to
the
second
had
for
its
scene
a
tavern
in
the
good
city
of
cork
where
evans
had
been
invited
to
sup
by
some
officers
stationed
in
the
neighbourhood
jack
responded
gladly
to
the
hospitable
suggestion
the
gathering
proved
a
great
success
the
wine
was
circulated
generously
and
many
toasts
were
offered
when
the
actor
was
called
upon
for
a
sentiment
he
proposed
the
health
of
his
gracious
sovereign
anne
whereat
all
in
the
company
were
pleased
with
the
exception
of
one
disloyal
redcoat
whether
the
latter
had
within
him
the
contrariness
which
cometh
with
too
liberal
dalliance
with
the
flowing
bowl
or
whether
he
chanced
to
be
a
jacobite
further
deponent
sayeth
not
but
it
is
at
least
certain
that
the
officer
was
not
pleased
at
the
honour
paid
to
the
queen
whose
uniform
he
was
willing
to
wear
so
malcontent
leaves
the
room
and
then
sends
up
word
to
poor
inoffensive
jack
that
he
will
be
delighted
to
see
that
worthy
below
stairs
whereupon
jack
quietly
steals
away
and
finds
his
antagonist
lurking
behind
a
door
the
soldier
makes
a
lunge
with
his
sword
at
the
player
who
succeeds
in
disarming
the
coward
and
there
the
matter
apparently
stops
but
the
end
was
not
yet
when
evans
went
to
dublin
he
found
that
his
late
challenger
was
circulating
a
lie
which
made
it
appear
that
the
comedian
had
in
somewise
affronted
the
whole
british
army
no
sooner
did
jack
put
his
face
upon
the
stage
than
a
great
clamour
arose
and
it
was
decreed
by
the
bullies
among
the
audience
of
whom
there
are
ever
a
few
in
every
house
that
no
play
should
be
presented
until
the
culprit
had
publicly
begged
pardon
for
a
sin
which
he
never
committed
the
play
was
the
rival
queens
the
part
assigned
to
evans
that
of
alexander
but
was
some
time
before
this
alexander
could
be
induced
to
crave
the
forgiveness
of
the
excitable
dublinites
finally
he
yielded
to
expediency
and
coming
forward
to
the
centre
of
the
stage
expressed
his
contrition
at
this
a
puppy
in
the
pit
cried
out
kneel
you
rascal
and
evans
now
thoroughly
exasperated
tartly
answered
no
you
rascal
i
kneel
to
none
but
god
and
my
queen
then
the
performance
began
a
footnote
a
as
there
were
many
worthy
gentlemen
of
the
army
who
knew
the
whole
affair
the
new
rais
clamour
ceas
and
the
play
went
through
without
any
molestation
and
by
degrees
things
return
to
their
proper
channel
by
this
we
may
see
it
is
some
danger
for
an
actor
to
be
in
the
chetwood
how
chetwood
bubbles
over
with
a
stream
of
anecdote
much
that
he
gives
us
in
his
general
history
of
the
stage
is
only
gossip
yet
what
is
there
more
fascinating
than
about
players
the
gossip
of
the
is
merely
inane
or
else
scandalous
but
shift
the
scene
to
the
theatre
and
a
story
no
longer
bores
it
is
consecrated
by
the
sacrament
of
interest
is
any
apology
necessary
therefore
if
the
quotation
marks
be
again
brought
into
requisition
this
time
the
anecdote
is
of
thomas
griffith
an
excellent
comedian
and
a
harmless
poet
after
his
commencing
actor
he
contracted
a
friendship
with
wilks
which
chain
remained
unbroke
till
the
death
of
that
excellent
comedian
tho
griffith
was
very
young
wilks
took
him
with
him
to
london
from
dublin
and
had
him
entered
for
that
season
at
a
small
salary
the
emperor
being
ordered
on
a
sudden
to
be
played
the
part
of
pizarro
a
spaniard
was
wanting
which
griffith
procured
with
some
difficulty
betterton
being
a
little
indisposed
would
not
venture
out
to
rehearsal
for
fear
of
increasing
his
indisposition
to
the
disappointment
of
the
audience
who
had
not
seen
our
young
stripling
rehearse
but
when
he
came
ready
at
the
entrance
his
ears
were
pierced
with
a
voice
not
familiar
to
him
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
stage
where
he
beheld
the
diminutive
pizarro
with
a
truncheon
as
long
as
himself
his
own
words
he
steps
up
to
downs
the
prompter
and
cry
downs
what
sucking
scaramouch
have
you
sent
on
there
replied
downs
good
enough
for
a
spaniard
the
part
is
small
betterton
return
he
had
made
his
eyebrows
his
whiskers
and
each
whisker
a
line
the
part
would
have
been
two
lines
too
much
for
such
a
monkey
in
buskins
poor
griffith
stood
on
the
stage
near
the
door
and
heard
every
syllable
of
the
short
dialogue
and
by
his
fears
knew
who
was
meant
by
it
but
happy
for
him
he
had
no
more
to
speak
that
scene
when
the
first
act
was
over
by
the
advice
of
downs
he
went
to
make
his
excuse
with
sir
i
had
not
taken
the
part
but
there
was
only
i
alone
out
of
the
play
i
reply
betterton
with
a
smile
art
but
the
tittle
of
an
i
griffith
seeing
him
in
no
ill
humour
told
him
ought
to
be
the
best
figures
on
the
stage
as
nature
had
made
them
like
reply
betterton
it
would
be
a
double
death
to
an
indian
cobbler
to
be
conquer
by
such
a
weazle
of
a
spaniard
as
thou
art
and
after
this
night
let
me
never
see
a
truncheon
in
thy
hand
again
unless
to
stir
the
fire
he
took
his
advice
laid
aside
the
buskin
and
stuck
to
the
sock
in
which
he
made
a
figure
equal
to
most
of
his
contemporaries
our
genius
flutters
with
the
plumes
of
youth
but
observation
wings
to
steddy
truth
no
one
can
resist
telling
another
story
this
time
of
fat
charles
hulet
whose
abilities
were
only
equalled
by
his
corpulence
having
been
apprenticed
to
a
bookseller
he
straightway
proceeded
to
take
a
violent
interest
in
the
drama
and
would
often
while
away
the
evenings
by
spouting
shakespeare
and
other
authors
in
lieu
of
a
company
to
support
him
young
hulet
would
designate
each
chair
in
the
kitchen
to
represent
one
of
the
characters
in
the
play
he
was
reciting
one
night
as
he
was
repeating
the
part
of
alexander
with
his
wooden
representative
of
clytus
an
old
and
coming
to
the
speech
where
the
old
general
is
to
be
kill
this
young
mock
alexander
snatch
a
poker
instead
of
a
javelin
and
threw
it
with
such
strength
against
poor
clytus
that
the
chair
was
kill
upon
the
spot
and
lay
mangled
on
the
floor
the
death
of
clytus
made
a
monstrous
noise
which
disturbed
the
master
in
the
parlour
who
called
out
to
know
the
reason
and
was
answered
by
the
cook
below
sir
but
that
alexander
has
kill
clytus
in
latter
days
hulet
took
great
pride
in
the
sonorous
tones
of
his
voice
and
loved
nothing
more
dearly
than
to
steal
up
behind
a
man
and
startle
the
unsuspecting
one
by
giving
a
very
loud
hem
it
was
a
hem
however
which
helped
to
make
the
actor
for
one
fine
day
he
repeated
the
trick
burst
a
and
died
within
hours
heaven
bless
all
these
merry
vagabonds
we
may
not
always
wish
to
follow
in
their
footsteps
but
we
like
to
keep
near
them
and
pry
into
their
careless
happy
lives
when
the
bohemians
enter
a
we
are
too
virtuous
presumably
to
go
in
likewise
but
we
stand
without
to
get
a
tempting
whiff
of
hot
negus
and
a
snatch
of
some
genial
jest
or
tuneful
song
then
if
our
players
stray
perchance
into
the
gloomy
precincts
of
a
are
we
not
quite
prepared
to
steal
up
to
the
window
and
discover
what
tribute
is
being
paid
to
mine
uncle
and
so
speaking
of
and
negus
and
let
us
end
our
extracts
from
the
invaluable
chetwood
with
this
unconventional
reminiscence
of
another
player
john
thurmond
it
was
a
custom
at
that
time
for
persons
of
the
first
rank
and
distinction
to
give
their
birthday
suits
to
the
most
favoured
actors
i
think
thurmond
was
honoured
by
general
ingolsby
with
his
but
his
finances
being
at
the
last
tide
of
ebb
the
rich
suit
was
put
in
buckle
a
cant
word
for
forty
in
the
hundred
interest
one
night
notice
was
given
that
the
general
would
be
present
with
the
government
at
the
play
and
all
the
performers
on
the
stage
were
preparing
to
dress
out
in
the
suits
presented
the
spouse
of
johnny
as
he
was
commonly
called
try
all
her
arts
to
persuade
holdfast
the
pawnbroker
as
it
fell
out
his
real
name
to
let
go
the
cloaths
for
that
evening
to
be
returned
when
the
play
was
over
but
all
arguments
were
fruitless
nothing
but
the
ready
or
a
pledge
of
full
equal
value
such
people
would
have
despised
a
demosthenes
or
a
cicero
with
all
their
rhetorical
flourishes
if
their
oratorian
gowns
had
been
in
pledge
well
what
must
be
done
the
whole
family
in
confusion
and
all
at
their
disgrace
with
her
glaring
eyes
and
extended
mouth
ready
to
devour
fatal
appearance
at
last
winny
the
wife
that
is
winnifrede
put
on
a
countenance
but
alas
with
a
troubled
heart
stepp
to
a
neighbouring
tavern
and
bespoke
a
very
hot
negus
to
comfort
johnny
in
the
great
part
he
was
to
perform
that
night
begging
to
have
the
silver
tankard
with
the
lid
because
as
she
said
covering
and
the
vehicle
silver
would
retain
heat
longer
than
any
other
metal
the
request
was
comply
with
the
negus
carry
to
the
playhouse
piping
hot
popp
into
a
vile
earthen
mug
the
tankard
travelled
under
her
apron
like
the
persian
ladies
veil
popp
into
the
pawnbroker
hands
in
exchange
for
the
suit
put
on
and
play
its
part
with
the
rest
of
the
wardrobe
when
its
duty
was
over
carried
back
to
remain
in
its
old
depository
the
tankard
return
the
right
road
and
when
the
tide
flowed
with
its
lunar
influence
the
stranded
suit
was
wafted
into
safe
harbour
again
after
paying
a
little
for
docking
which
was
all
the
damage
received
and
chetwood
adds
thus
woman
wit
tho
some
account
it
evil
with
artful
wiles
can
overreach
the
devil
among
such
as
these
good
bad
and
indifferent
moral
and
otherwise
did
mistress
oldfield
pass
what
hours
she
consecrated
to
the
theatre
in
the
early
years
when
merely
a
poor
struggling
postulant
before
the
altar
of
fame
the
girl
must
have
been
more
or
less
intimate
with
her
dramatic
associates
but
as
time
went
on
and
nance
blazed
into
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
the
old
feeling
of
fellowship
may
have
become
weakened
not
that
the
actress
was
in
any
sense
snobbish
rather
let
it
be
said
that
the
circumstances
of
her
celebrity
proved
quite
enough
in
the
course
of
human
affairs
to
separate
her
from
the
other
players
indeed
one
of
her
biographers
relates
that
oldfield
always
went
in
state
to
drury
lane
accompanied
by
two
footmen
and
that
she
seldom
spoke
to
any
one
of
the
actors
a
footnote
a
she
always
went
to
the
house
the
theatre
in
the
same
dress
she
had
worn
at
dinner
in
her
visits
to
the
houses
of
great
people
for
she
was
much
caressed
on
account
of
her
general
merit
and
her
connection
with
churchill
she
used
to
go
to
the
playhouse
in
a
chair
attended
by
two
footmen
she
seldom
spoke
to
any
one
of
the
actors
and
was
allowed
a
sum
of
money
to
buy
her
own
general
biographical
dictionary
nance
may
have
made
her
entry
into
the
amid
royal
auspices
but
who
can
for
a
second
believe
that
she
seldom
spoke
to
any
one
of
the
actors
there
was
in
her
composition
too
much
of
sunshine
to
warrant
any
such
belief
and
then
we
know
that
behind
the
scenes
she
was
ever
affable
and
friendly
if
she
did
not
brook
familiarity
which
comes
of
contempt
and
if
she
moved
about
among
her
companions
with
dignity
then
so
much
the
better
of
nance
sweetness
of
temper
and
sterling
cibber
has
left
us
an
attractive
memory
it
seems
that
when
the
drury
lane
management
determined
to
revive
the
provoked
wife
of
sir
john
vanbrugh
january
colley
suggested
that
wilks
should
take
a
rest
during
the
run
of
the
piece
and
allow
barton
booth
to
play
the
lover
constant
the
idea
did
not
meet
with
wilks
approval
down
dropt
his
brow
and
fur
were
his
features
and
the
became
the
scene
of
a
violent
spat
between
cibber
and
himself
with
oldfield
and
other
members
of
the
company
as
excited
listeners
finally
the
author
of
the
apology
said
are
you
not
every
day
complaining
of
your
being
and
now
upon
the
first
offering
to
ease
you
you
fly
into
a
passion
and
pretend
to
make
that
a
greater
grievance
than
but
sir
if
your
being
in
or
out
of
the
play
is
a
hardship
you
shall
impose
it
upon
yourself
the
part
is
in
your
hand
and
to
us
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
now
whether
you
take
it
or
leave
it
illustration
sir
john
vanbrugh
by
sir
godfrey
kneller
upon
this
wilks
threw
down
the
part
upon
the
table
crossed
his
arms
and
sate
knocking
his
heel
upon
the
floor
as
seeming
to
threaten
most
when
he
said
least
hereupon
booth
generously
yielded
up
the
much
disputed
constant
to
his
rival
with
the
remark
that
for
his
part
he
saw
no
such
great
matter
in
acting
every
day
for
he
believed
it
the
wholsomest
exercise
in
the
world
it
kept
the
spirits
in
motion
and
always
gave
him
a
good
stomach
and
the
elegant
barton
be
it
remembered
was
a
great
eater
here
says
cibber
i
observed
oldfield
began
to
titter
behind
her
fan
but
wilks
being
more
intent
upon
what
booth
had
said
reply
every
one
could
best
feel
for
himself
but
he
did
not
pretend
to
the
strength
of
a
therefore
if
oldfield
would
chuse
anybody
else
to
play
with
her
he
should
be
very
glad
to
be
excus
this
throwing
the
negative
upon
oldfield
was
indeed
a
sure
way
to
save
himself
which
i
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
by
saying
it
was
making
but
an
ill
compliment
to
the
company
to
suppose
there
was
but
one
man
in
it
fit
to
play
an
ordinary
part
with
her
here
oldfield
got
up
and
turning
me
half
round
to
come
forward
said
with
her
usual
frankness
you
are
all
a
parcel
of
fools
to
make
such
a
rout
about
nothing
rightly
judging
that
the
person
most
out
of
humour
would
not
be
more
displeased
at
her
calling
us
all
by
the
same
name
as
she
knew
too
the
best
way
of
ending

ashton
was
it
any
wonder
that
when
dick
steele
aetat
an
officer
of
fusiliers
and
a
merry
vagabond
wanted
to
redeem
his
reputation
by
writing
a
rollicking
comedy
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
satirising
of
the
british
undertaker
for
the
young
man
must
prove
to
the
town
that
he
was
not
the
hypocrite
several
of
his
kind
friends
had
dubbed
him
the
fact
was
that
he
had
been
virtuous
enough
to
write
a
pious
work
entitled
the
christian
hero
which
he
afterwards
published
but
as
he
had
not
grown
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
live
up
to
its
golden
precepts
nay
rather
did
he
continue
to
spend
his
evenings
in
the
taverns
the
author
came
in
for
many
a
taunt
and
sneer
why
did
he
not
practice
what
he
preached
was
the
sarcastic
query
of
his
intimates
yet
there
was
no
thought
of
cant
in
what
the
soldier
had
done
his
design
in
issuing
the
christian
hero
was
as
he
explained
in
after
years
principally
to
fix
upon
his
own
mind
a
strong
impression
of
virtue
and
religion
in
opposition
to
a
stronger
propensity
towards
unwarrantable
pleasures
this
secret
admiration
was
too
weak
he
therefore
printed
the
book
with
his
name
in
hopes
that
a
standing
testimony
against
himself
and
the
eyes
of
the
world
that
is
to
say
of
his
acquaintances
upon
him
in
a
new
light
would
make
him
ashamed
of
understanding
and
seeming
to
feel
what
was
virtuous
and
living
so
contrary
to
life
but
the
man
was
weak
where
the
author
was
willing
and
thus
gay
richard
went
on
living
so
contrary
a
life
with
true
celtic
perversity
and
made
of
himself
anything
but
a
christian
hero
rather
was
he
a
jolly
pagan
with
a
passion
for
his
wine
and
his
and
a
kindly
merry
word
even
for
those
who
twitted
him
upon
his
inconsistency
it
was
plain
therefore
that
he
must
be
some
other
sort
of
hero
and
so
he
evolved
the
brilliant
satire
of
the
funeral
to
enliven
his
character
and
repel
the
sarcasms
of
those
who
abused
him
for
his
declarations
relative
to
religion

the

the

enthusiastic
town
and
the
playwright
arose
from
his
his
and
his
contemplation
of
ideal
christianity
to
find
himself
famous
he
had
opened
a
new
vein
of
satire
and
a
vein
moreover
which
upheld
virtue
and
laughed
to
scorn
hypocrisy
and
vice
that
was
a
moral
which
the
dramatists
of
his
epoch
seldom
taught
a
and
so
the
people
crowded
to
the
theatre
applauded
the
sentiment
of
the
play
guffawed
at
the
keen
wit
of
the
dialogue
and
swore
that
this
young
rascal
steele
was
the
prince
of
bright
fellows

they
went
home
and
revelled
as
before
in
the
funerals
of
their

the

nay
thou

ever
been
my

now
i
reward
thy

oh
how
my
head
runs
my
first
year
out
and
jumps
to
all
the
joys
of
widowhood
if
thirteen
months
hence
a

should
haul
one
to

see
a
what
pleasure
be

my

footman
called
who
kept
a
place
for
that
very
purpose
to
make
a
sudden
insurrection
of
fine
wigs
in
the
pit
and
then
with
a
pretty
sorrow
in
face
and
a
willing
blush
for
being
stared
at
one
ventures
to
look
round
and
bow
to
one
of
one
own
quality

to
a
snug
pretending
fellow
of
no
fortune
thus
scarce
seeing
to
one
that
writes
lampoons
thus
to
one
who
really
loves
thus
to
one
from
box
to
box
thus
looks
differently
and
when
one
has
done
one
part
observe
the
actors
do
theirs
but
with
my
mind
fixed
not
on
those
i
look
at
but
those
that
look
at
me
then
the
serenades
the
lovers
a
query
if
the
theatres
were
patronised
only
by
those
who
looked
solely
at
the
stage
what
would
be
the
size
of
the
audiences
footnote
a
a
widow
kept
herself
at
home
for
six
weeks
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
denied
herself
the
theatre
and
other
public
amusements
for
a
twelvemonth
tat
oh
madam
you
make
my
heart
bound
within
me
i
warrant
you
madam
i
manage
them
all
and
indeed
madam
the
men
are
really
very
silly
creatures
is
no
such
hard
matter
they
rulers
they
governors
i
warrant
you
indeed
widow
ay
tattleaid
they
imagine
themselves
mighty
things
but
government
founded
on
force
only
is
a
brutal
power
we
rule
them
by
their
affections
which
blinds
them
into
belief
that
they
rule
us
or
at
least
are
in
the
government
with
us
but
in
this
nation
our
power
is
absolute
thus
thus
we
sway
her
a
fan
is
both
the
standard
and
the
flag
of
england
i
laugh
to
see
men
go
on
our
errands
strut
in
great
offices
live
in
cares
hazards
and
scandals
to
come
home
and
be
fools
to
us
in
brags
of
their
dispatches
negotiations
and
their
wisdoms

my
good
dear
deceas
use
to
entertain
me

i
to
relieve
myself
from

lisp
some
silly

pat
him

he
shakes
his

this
pleasant
conversation
lord
brumpton
overhears
as
he
does
also
the
inmost
secrets
of
his
lawyer
puzzle
the
latter
gentleman
who
has
studied
hard
to
cheat
his
employer
and
succeeded
is
a
daringly
drawn
satire
on
the
pettifogging
attorney
of
the
period
a
note
the
following
words
of
wisdom
to
the
drawing
of
wills
which
mr
puzzle
addresses
to
his
nephew
footnote
a
of
the
attorney
of
queen
anne
day
ward
wrote
he
an
amphibious
monster
that
partakes
of
two
natures
and
those
contrary
he
a
great
lover
both
of
peace
and
enmity
and
has
no
sooner
set
people
together
by
the
ears
but
is
soliciting
the
law
to
make
an
end
of
the
difference
his
learning
is
commonly
as
little
as
his
honesty
and
his
conscience
much
larger
than
his
green
bag
catch
him
in
what
company
soever
you
will
always
hear
him
stating
of
cases
or
telling
what
notice
my
lord
chancellor
took
of
him
when
he
beg
leave
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
his
counsel
he
always
talks
with
as
great
assurance
as
if
he
understood
what
he
only
pretends
to
know
and
always
wears
a
band
and
in
that
lies
his
gravity
and
wisdom
he
concerns
himself
with
no
justice
but
the
justice
of
a
cause
and
for
making
an
unconscionable
bill
he
outdoes
a
taylor
puzzle
as
for
legacies
they
are
good
or
not
as
i
please
for
let
me
tell
you
a
man
must
take
pen
ink
and
paper
sit
down
by
an
old
fellow
and
pretend
to
take
directions
but
a
true
lawyer
never
makes
any
man
will
but
his
own
and
as
the
priest
of
old
among
us
got
near
the
dying
man
and
gave
all
to
the
church
so
now
the
lawyer
gives
all
to
the
law
clerk
ay
sir
but
priests
then
cheated
the
nation
by
doing
their
offices
in
an
unknown
language
puzzle
true
but
ours
is
a
way
much
surer
for
we
cheat
in
no
language
at
all
but
loll
in
our
own
coaches
eloquent
in
gibberish
and
learned
in
jingle
pull
out
the
parchment
to
the
will
lord
brumpton
there
the
deed
i
made
it
as
long
as
i
could
well
i
hope
to
see
the
day
when
the
indenture
shall
be
the
exact
measure
of
the
land
that
passes
by
it
for
is
a
discouragement
to
the
gown
that
every
ignorant
rogue
of
an
heir
should
in
a
word
or
two
understand
his
father
meaning
and
hold
ten
acres
of
land
by
of
parchment
nay
i
hope
to
see
the
time
when
that
there
is
indeed
some
progress
made
in
shall
be
wholly
affected
and
by
the
improvement
of
the
noble
art
of
tautology
every
inn
in
holborn
an
inn
of
court
let
others
think
of
logic
rhetoric
and
i
know
not
what
impertinence
but
mind
thou
tautology
what
the
first
excellence
in
a
lawyer
tautology
what
the
second
tautology
what
the
third
tautology
as
an
old
pleader
said
of
action
who
shall
say
that
the
tautological
sentiments
of
mr
puzzle
are
not
still
inculcated
nay
the
whole
play
furnishes
a
capital
instance
of
the
truism
that
the
world
changes
but
little
and
furthermore
that
the
mould
of
nigh
two
centuries
can
not
spoil
the
wit
of
sparkling
steele
ah
dick
dick
you
may
have
been
a
sorry
dog
with
your
toasts
and
your
taverns
yet
is
a
thousand
pities
that
a
few
dramatists
of
can
not
drink
inspiration
from
the
same
cups
to
continue
our
cheerful
journey
with
this
unusual
funeral
we
soon
find
ourselves
introduced
to
lord
hardy
the
unjustly
discarded
son
of
brumpton
hardy
is
a
honest
man
of
quality
a
trifle
out
at
elbows
just
now
owing
to
the
stoppage
of
financial
supplies
from
the
paternal
mansion
his
straits
are
oft
severe
and
it
is
fortunate
that
he
has
in
trim
a
faithful
servant
who
knows
so
well
how
to
keep
the
duns
at
bay
why
friend
says
i
trim
is
describing
to
hardy
his
method
of
dealing
with
his
lordship
creditors
how
often
must
i
tell
you
my
lord
is
not
stirring
his
lordship
has
not
slept
well
you
must
come
some
other
time
your
lordship
will
send
for
him
when
you
are
at
leisure
to
look
upon
money
affairs
or
if
they
are
so
saucy
so
impertinent
as
to
press
a
man
of
your
quality
for
their
own
there
are
canes
there
bridewel
there
the
stocks
for
your
ordinary
tradesmen
but
to
an
haughty
thriving
covent
garden
mercer
silk
or
laceman
your
lordship
gives
your
most
humble
service
to
him
hopes
his
wife
is
well
you
have
letters
to
write
or
you
would
see
him
yourself
but
you
desire
he
would
be
with
you
punctually
on
such
a
day
that
is
to
say
the
day
after
you
are
gone
out
of
town
which
shows
very
plainly
that
trim
could
have
earned
large
wages
had
he
lived
in
the
nineteenth
century
these
days
are
not
long
enough
however
to
permit
the
introduction
of
all
the
characters
nor
the
outlining
of
the
entire
story
with
its
brisk
but
this
bit
of
dialogue
which
occurs
after
sable
has
discovered
the
lord
brumpton
is
too
good
to
be
ignored
sable
why
my
lord
you
ca
in
conscience
put
me
off
so
i
must
do
according
to
my
orders
cut
you
up
and
embalm
you
except
you
come
down
a
little
deeper
than
you
talk
of
you
do
consider
the
charges
i
have
been
at
already
lord
brumpton
charges
for
what
sable
first
twenty
guineas
to
my
lady
woman
for
notice
of
your
death
a
fee
i
before
now
known
the
widow
herself
go
halves
in
but
no
matter
for
that
in
the
next
place
ten
pounds
for
watching
you
all
your
long
fit
of
sickness
last
winter
lord
brumpton
watching
me
why
i
had
none
but
my
own
servants
by
turns
sable
i
mean
attending
to
give
notice
of
your
death
i
had
all
your
long
fit
of
sickness
last
winter
at
half
a
crown
a
day
a
fellow
waiting
at
your
gate
to
bring
me
intelligence
but
you
unfortunately
recovered
and
i
lost
all
my
obliging
pains
for
your
service
lord
brumpton
ha
ha
ha
sable
a
very
impudent
fellow
half
a
crown
a
day
to
attend
my
decease
and
dost
thou
reckon
it
to
me
sable
i
have
a
book
at
home
which
i
call
my
where
i
have
every
man
of
quality
age
and
distemper
in
town
and
know
when
you
should
drop
nay
my
lord
if
you
had
reflected
upon
your
mortality
half
so
much
as
poor
i
have
for
you
you
would
not
desire
to
return
to
life
thus
in
short
i
can
not
keep
this
a
secret
under
the
whole
money
i
am
to
have
for
burying
you
of
course
lady
brumpton
is
discomfited
and
disgraced
at
the
end
of
the
play
and
of
course
lord
brumpton
is
reconciled
to
his
son
for
steele
took
care
that
virtue
should
be
rewarded
and
the
moral
code
otherwise
preserved
as
to
her
ladyship
who
has
proved
a
very
entertaining
sort
of
villain
we
shall
take
leave
of
her
in
one
of
the
best
scenes
of
the
comedy

the
names
of
the
visitors
who
have
called
to
leave
their
condolences

smug
old
woman

is
no
enduring
her
affectation
of
youth
but

a
grandchild

so
much
of

great

pitted

my
condolence

are
to
ask
for
me
widow

exquisite
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
surpassing
my
lady
sly
who
pretends
to
have
the
whole
town
for
her
husband
they
are
certainly
coming
oh
no
here
let
me
thus
let
me
sit
and
think
on
her
couch
while
she
is
raving
as
to

the
wretched
disconsolate
as
i
am
alas

of
her
first
lady
but
madam

you
hear
what
the
town
says
of
the
jilt
flirt
the
men
liked
so
much
in
the
park
hark
ye
was
seen
with
him
in
a
hackney
coach
second
lady
impudent
flirt
to
be
found
out
third
lady
but
i
speak
it
only
to
you
fourth
lady
next
nor
i
but
to
no
one
fifth
lady
widow
i
ca
believe
it
nay
i
always
thought
it
madam
widow
sure
is
impossible
the
demure
prim
thing
sure
all
the
world
is
hypocrisy
well
i
thank
my
stars
whatsoever
sufferings
i
have
i
have
none
in
reputation
i
wonder
at
the
men
i
could
never
think
her
handsome
she
has
really
a
good
shape
and
complexion
but
no
mein
and
no
woman
has
the
use
of
her
beauty
without
mein
her
charms
are
dumb
they
want
utterance
but
whither
does
distraction
lead
me
to
talk
of
charms
first
lady
charms
a
chit
a
girl
charms
come
let
us
widows
be
true
to
ourselves
keep
our
countenances
and
our
characters
and
a
fig
for
the
maids
second
lady
ay
since
they
will
set
up
for
our
knowledge
why
should
not
we
for
their
ignorance
third
lady
but
madam
o
sunday
morning
at
church
i
curtsied
to
you
and
looked
at
a
great
fuss
in
a
glaring
light
dress
next
pew
that
strong
masculine
thing
is
a
knight
wife
pretends
to
all
the
tenderness
in
the
world
and
would
fain
put
the
unwieldly
upon
us
for
the
soft
the
languid
she
has
of
a
sudden
left
her
dairy
and
sets
up
for
a
fine
town
lady
calls
her
maid
cisly
her
woman
speaks
to
her
by
her
surname
of
cherryfist
and
her
great
of
nineteen
big
enough
for
a
trooper
is
stripped
into
a
laced
coat
now
mr
page
forsooth
fourth
lady
oh
i
have
seen
her
well
i
heartily
pity
some
people
for
their
wealth
they
might
have
been
unknown
else
you
would
die
madam
to
see
her
and
her
equipage
i
thought
her
horses
were
ashamed
of
their
finery
they
dragged
on
as
if
they
were
all
at
plough
and
a
great
booby
behind
grasp
the
coach
as
if
he
had
never
held
one
fifth
lady
alas
some
people
think
there
is
nothing
but
being
fine
to
be
genteel
but
the
high
prance
of
the
horses
and
the
brisk
insolence
of
the
servants
in
an
equipage
of
quality
are
inimitable
first
lady
now
you
talk
of
an
equipage
i
envy
this
lady
the
beauty
she
will
appear
in
a
mourning
coach
it
will
so
become
her
complexion
i
confess
i
myself
mourned
for
two
years
for
no
other
reason
take
up
that
hood
there
oh
that
fair
face
with
a
veil
take
up
her
widow
fie
fie
ladies
but
i
have
been
told
indeed
black
does
become
second
lady
well
i
take
the
liberty
to
speak
it
there
is
young
nutbrain
has
long
had
i
be
sworn
a
passion
for
this
lady
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
fear
she
dislike
that
is
he
is
younger
than
she
is
third
lady
no
that
no
exception
but
i
tell
you
one
he
is
younger
than
his
brother
widow
talk
not
of
such
affairs
who
could

rather
was
it
the

santlow
that
dancing
bit
of

who
turned
the
heads
of
many
an
amorous

had
enough

contrived

when

however
sprightly

deftly
did
this
charmer
pirouette
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
luxury
of
appearing
as
a
regular
actress
her
first
venture
in
this
direction
was
as
the
eunuch
of
valentinian
wherein
she
donned
boy
attire
and
was
much
more
successful
in
masculine
garb
than
have
been

that
of

the

was
but
a
step
and
a
step
be
it
said
which
for
the
moment
consoled
the
public
for
her
desertion
from
the
ballet
according
to
cibber
santlow
was
the
happiest
incident
in
the
fortune
of
the
play
and
the
laureate
tells
us
that
she
was
then
in
the
full
bloom
of
what
beauty
she
might
pretend
to
b
he
adds
that
before
this
she
had
only
been
admired
as
the
most
excellent
dancer
which
perhaps
might
not
a
little
contribute
to
the
favourable
reception
she
now
met
with
as
an
actress
in
this
character
which
so
happily
suited
her
figure
and
capacity
the
gentle
softness
of
her
voice
the
composed
innocence
of
her
aspect

to

it
might
appear
from
this
remark
of
colley
that
the
santlow
was
not
over
handsome
yet
if
a
picture
taken
from
life
does
not
belie
her
the
dancer
was
most
fair
to
look
upon
this
weak
society
was
the
new
company
recruited
by
william
collier
for
drury

and
wherein
could
be
found
in
addition
to
the

such
players

at
that

it
is
very
evident
that
the
success
of
the
fair
quaker
a
success
made
in
face
of
the
counter
attraction
furnished
by
the
long
trial
of
sacheverel
went
sorely
against
the
grain
with
him
a
the
fact
was
that
things
at
the
hay
market
were
not
flourishing
and
the
prosperity
enjoyed
by
the
drury
lane
comedy
and
the
sacheverel
show
seemed
tantalising
to
bear
footnote
a
shadwell
evidently
had
cibber
in
mind
when
he
wrote
in
the
preface
to
the
fair
quaker
of
deal
this
play
was
written
about
three
years
since
and
put
into
the
hands
of
a
famous
comedian
belonging
to
the
haymarket
playhouse
who
took
care
to
beat
down
the
value
of
it
so
much
as
to
offer
the
author
to
alter
it
fit
to
appear
on
the
stage
on
condition
he
might
have
half
the
profits
of
the
third
day
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
may
pass
for
one
of
his
according
to
custom
the
author
not
agreeing
to
this
reasonable
proposal
it
lay
in
his
hands
till
the
beginning
of
this
winter
when
booth
read
it
and
liked
it
and
persuaded
the
author
that
with
a
little
alteration
it
would
please
the
town
even
in
after
years
colley
grew
bitter
in
thinking
of
the
fair
quaker
and
could
not
help
indulging
in
a
dig
at
its
expense
when
he
came
to
write
the
apology
he
likewise
paid
his
satirical
compliments
to
the
italian
opera
which
was
given
at
the
haymarket
during
the
season
of
on
the
days
when
the
regular
dramatic
company
did
not
appear
the
opera
had
already
proved
a
drawing
attraction
but
at
the
time
here
mentioned
the
popular
interest
in
the
performances
had
fallen
off
and
the
dear
and
ever
fickle
public
of
high
and
low
degree
prefered
either
drury
lane
or
the
trial
of
sacheverel
to
the
artistic
delights
of
music
and
the
drama
at
the
rival
house
and
so
cibber
plaintively
sighs
the
truth
is
that
this
kind
of
entertainment
opera
being
so
entirely
sensual
it
had
no
possibility
of
getting
the
better
of
our
reason
but
by
its
novelty
and
that
novelty
could
never
be
supported
but
by
an
annual
change
of
the
best
voices
which
like
the
finest
flowers
bloom
but
for
a
season
and
when
that
is
over
are
only
dead
nosegays
from
this
natural
cause
we
have
seen
within
these
two
years
even
farinelli
singing
to
an
audience
of
five
and
thirty
pounds
and
yet
if
common
fame
may
be
credited
the
same
voice
so
neglected
in
one
country
has
in
another
had
charms
sufficient
to
make
that
crown
sit
easy
on
the
head
of
a
monarch
which
the
jealousy
of
politicians
who
had
their
views
in
his
keeping
it
fear
without
some
such
extraordinary
amusement
his
satiety
of
empire
might
tempt
him
a
second
time
to
resign
a

a
the
monarch
alluded
to
was
evidently
victor
amadeus
king
of
sardinia
the
tenor
farinelli
whose
real
name
was
carlo
broschi
was
born
in
the
dukedom
of
modena
in
and
died
that
cibber
knew
something
of
the
wrangles
which
inevitably
follow
in
the
wake
of
an
operatic
troupe
may
be
seen
from
the
next
paragraph
there
is
too
in
the
very
species
of
an
italian
singer
such
an
innate
fantastical
pride
and
caprice
that
the
government
of
them
here
at
least
is
almost
impracticable
this
distemper
as
we
were
not
sufficiently
warn
or
apprized
of
threw
our
musical
affairs
into
perplexities
we
knew
not
easily
how
to
get
out
of
there
is
scarce
a
sensible
auditor
in
the
kingdom
that
has
not
since
that
time
had
occasion
to
laugh
at
the
several
instances
of
it
but
what
is
still
more
ridiculous
these
costly
canary
birds
have
sometimes
infested
the
whole
body
of
our
dignified
lovers
of
musick
with
the
same
childish
animosities
it
was
merely
an
illustration
of
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
heavenly
maid
of
music
is
too
often
attended
by
the
handmaiden
of
discord
but
to
continue
ladies
have
been
known
says
colley
to
decline
their
visits
upon
account
of
their
being
of
a
different
musical
party
caesar
and
pompey
made
not
a
warmer

up

musick
by
their
implacable
pretentions
to
superiority
a
and
while
this
greatness
of
soul
is
their
unalterable
virtue
it
will
never
be
practicable
to
make
two
capital
singers
of
the

as
they
should
do
in

no

it
has
already
thrown
after

an
extraordinary
occasion
has
called
a
greater
number
of
their
best
to

the
mischief
they
have
made
has
been
proportionable

upon

when
it
came

what

they
made

excellency

upon
the

it
proved
to
be
as
barbarously
bad
as
if
malice
itself
had
composed
it
it
was
a
pity
no
doubt
that
the
light
of
opera
shone
but
dimly
at

yet
the
ill
wind
which
almost
extinguished
that
light
blew
a
blessing
towards
the
nimble
santlow
for
the
dear
creature
prospered
exceeding
well
as
dorcas
zeal
the
heart
of
the
public
waxed
warm
toward
the
and
so
did
the
cardiac
organ
of
barton
booth
a
few
years
later
booth
married
the
charmer
and
she
having
become
virtuous
and
prim
made
the
remainder
of
his
life
a
bed
of
domestic
roses
and
now
for
the
brief
story
of
booth
dignified
career
barton
came
of
good
english
stock
and
his
father
with
a
true
british
desire
to
rule
the
destinies
of
his
family
mapped
out
a
clerical
life
for
the
boy
but
the
latter
had
no
thought
of
the
pulpit
and
from
the
time
that
he
acted
in
the
andria
of
terence
at
westminster
school
his
hope
was
all
for
the
stage
is
very
easy
to
applaud
that
hope
now
perhaps
his
relations
looked
upon
it
as
a
temptation
offered
by
the
evil
one
when
he
reached
the
mature
age
of
seventeen
and
had
orders
to
begin
his
university
training
what
does
the
youth
do
but
run
away
from
home
and
taking
the
theatrical
bull
by
the
horns
appear
on
the
dublin
boards
he
first
apply
to
betterton
then
to
smith
two
celebrated
actors
says
chetwood
but
they
decently
refused
him
for
fear
of
the
resentment
of
his
family
but
this
did
not
prevent
his
pursuing
the
point
in
view
therefore
he
resolv
for
ireland
and
safely
arrived
in
june
his
first
rudiments
ashbury
a
taught
him
and
his
first
appearance
was
in
the
part
of
oroonoko
where
he
acquitted
himself
so
well
to
a
crowded
audience
that
ashbury
rewarded
him
with
a
present
of
five
guineas
which
was
the
more
acceptable
as
his
last
shilling

settled
his

this

said
to

she
rather
chose
to
give
the
musick
the
preference
of
her
attention
this
indifference
was
so
offensive
to
his
high
heart
that
he
began
to
change
the
tender
into
the
terrible
and
in
short
proceeded
at
last
to
treat
her
in
a
style
too
grossly
insulting
for
the
meanest
female
ear
to
endur
unresented
upon
which
being
beaten
too
far
out
of
her
discretion
she
turn
hastily

him
with
an
angry
look

his
merit
in
so
low
a
regard

himself

of

it
stands
out
in
rather
pleasant

its
even
tenor

prosperity
it
was
free
from
the
vicissitudes
which
have
waylaid
the
paths
of
equally
great
artists
and
the
current
of
his
genius
ran
on
without
a
ripple
save
that
of
sickness
there
was
one
direction
however
wherein
booth
found
variety
and
excitement
and
that
was
in
the
wondrous
diversity
of
parts
which
he
assumed
in
tragedy
his
work
took
a
wide
range
going
all
the
way
from
laertes
to
othello
while
he
sallied
forth
now
and
again
into
the
field
of
comedy
and
emerged
therefrom
with
honour
he
did
not
to
be
sure
distinguish
himself
so
brilliantly
as
a
comedian
as
he
did
in
tragic
garb
yet
he
wooed
thalia
in
a
genteel
way
which
seldom
failed
to
please
nay
it
is
chronicled
that
he
impersonated
falstaff
in
a
fashion
that
amused
even
phlegmatic
queen
anne
but
the
actor
of
long
ago
thought
nothing
of
such
catholicity
in
art
he
often
worked
like
a
horse
that

might

a

match
such
a

perhaps
the
most
annoying
disturbance
which
ever
came
into
theatrical
life
and
not
a
great
disturbance
at
that
was
the
jealousy
which
existed
between
wilks
and
himself
wilks
was
impetuous
bad
tempered
and
crotchety
and
it
is
possible
that
the
envy
was
originally
rather
of
his
own
making
but
be
that
as
it
may
booth
suffered
many
a
pang
from
the
successes
of
the
more
dashing
wilks
and
the
latter
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
thwarting
his
associate
we
remember
how
the
commonplace
mills
was
pushed
forward
with
the
idea
of
hiding
the
genius
of
barton
and
cibber
refers
more
than
once
to
this
policy
of
wilks
and
yet
again
he
writes
booth
himself
when
he
came
to
be
a
manager
would
sometimes
suffer
his
judgment
to
be
blinded
by
his
inclination
to
actors
whom
the
town
seem
to
have
but
an
indifferent
opinion
of
and
thereupon
colley
asks
another
of
his
old
questions
have
we
never
seen
the
same
passions
govern
a
court
how
many
white
staffs
and
great
places
do
we
find
in
our
histories

been
laid
at
the
feet
of
a
monarch
because
they
chose
not
to
give
way
to
a
rival
in
power
or
hold
a
second
place
in
his
favour
how
many
whigs
and
tories
have
changed
their
parties
when
their
good
or
bad
pretentions
have
met
with
a
check
to
their
higher
preferment
the
fact
is
that
there
was
never
any
artistic
sympathy
between
the
two
distinguished
actors
booth
could
play
comedy
and
play
it
quite
well
but
his
soul
was
all
for
tragedy
on
the
other
hand
while
wilks
knew
how
to
tread
the
sombre
paths
of
high
drama
he
even
made
a
creditable
hamlet
the
comedian
looked

at
times
in

respects
except
his
power
to
go
on
the
stage
in
good
health
and
went
among
the
players
for
his
amusement
his
curiosity
drew
him
to

nights
when

acted

characters
in
which

appeared
with
uncommon
lustre
all

admired

the
repeated
bursts
of
applause

he
extorted

but
all
these
petty
heartburnings
and
jealousies
were
buried
in
the
grave
of
wilks
that
incomparable
player
whose
sprightliness
seemed
to
defy
the
grim
tyrant
and
who
could
act
the
lithesome
youth
upon
the
stage
even
though
he
had
to
hobble

when
the
piece
was

last
exit

autumn

on

long
journey

after

illness
during
which
the
great
patient
was
dosed
with
crude
mercury
bled
plastered
blistered
and
otherwise
helped
onward
to
his
death
verily
it
is
a
wonder
that
the
physicians
of
old
did
not
extinguish
the
whole
human
race
the
still
attractive
santlow
or
rather
booth
survived
the
tragedian
and
her
sorrow
may
have
been
assuaged
by
the
remembrance
that
she
was
left
the
sole
heir
of
her
husband
i
have
considered
my
circumstances
wrote
booth
in
his
will
and
finding
upon
a
strict
examination
that
all
i
am
now
possessed
of
does
not
amount
to
of
the
fortune
my
wife
brought
me
on
the
day
of
our
marriage
together
with
the
yearly
additions
and
advantages
since
arising
from
her
laborious
employment
on
the
stage
during
twelve
years
past
i
thought
myself
bound
by
honesty
honour
and
gratitude
due
to
her
constant
affection
not
to
give
away
any
part
of
the
remainder
of
her
fortune
at
my
death
and
with
that
eloquent
stroke
of
the
pen
the
testator
cut
off
with
nothing
a
sister
and
a
brother
whom
he
had
sufficiently
helped
during
his
lifetime
surely
so
noble
an
actor
deserves
an
epitaph
perhaps
none
could
be
more
worthy
than
this
estimate
of
the
man
made
by
aaron
hill
he
had
learning
to
understand
perfectly
whatever
it
was
his
part
to
speak
and
judgment
to
know
how
far
it
agreed
or
disagreed
with
his
character
hence
arose
a
peculiar
grace
which
was
visible
to
every
spectator
tho
few
were
at
the
pains
of
examining
into
the
cause
of
their
pleasure
he
could
soften
or
slide
over
with
a
kind
of
elegant
negligence
the
improprieties
in
a
part
he
acted
while
on
the
contrary
he
would
dwell
with
energy
upon
the
beauties
as
if
he
exerted
a
latent
spirit
which
had
been
kept
back
for
such
an
occasion
that
he
might
alarm
waken
and
transport
to
those
places
only
where
the
dignity
of
his
own
good
sense
could
be
supported
with
that
of
his
author
if
some
players
of
will
take
a
lesson
by
this
description
the
judicious
booth
need
not
have
lived
in
vain
his
soul
like
that
of
the
late
lamented
john
brown
will
go
marching
on
chapter
xi
the
fading
of
a
star
the
life
of
mistress
oldfield
like
that
of
barton
booth
was
cast
in
pleasant
places
yet
the
lady
had
her
little
agitations
and
found
them
no
doubt
rather
an
incentive
to
existence
than
otherwise
take
for
instance
the
excitement
surrounding
the
production
during
the
drury
lane
season
of
of
centlivre
play
the
perplexed
lovers
to
the
lovely
nance
was
entrusted
the
duty
of
speaking
the
epilogue
thereto
wherein
prince
eugene
at
that
time
on
a
visit
to
england
and
the
duke
of
marlborough
were
lauded
in
the
true
spirit
of
ancient
flunkeyism
but
the
animosity
which
politics
doth
breed
ran
high
and
the
first
night
of
the
performance
went
by
without
the
introduction
of
the
eulogy
some
patriots
objected
to
the
sentiments
which
it
contained
and
the
managers
were
cautious
as
for
oldfield
she
might
have
been
cautious
too
and
with
reason
for
she
had
received
letters
threatening
her
with
dire
pains
and
penalties
if
she
spoke
the
offending
words
but
anne
stood
ready
to
deliver
them
at
whatsoever
time
the
patentees
might
name
so
when
the
second
night
of
the
perplexed
lovers
arrived
and
a
special
licence
from
the
lord
chamberlain
had
been
secured
the
actress
came
valiantly
forward
and
spoke
the
epilogue
with
success
perhaps
eugene
of
savoy
thanked
oldfield
let
us
hope
that
he
did
and
it
is
at
least
certain
that
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
play
his
highness
sent
centlivre
an
elaborate
gold
a
footnote
a
speaking
of
the
beau
outfit
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
ashton
says
his
too
was
an
object
of
his
solicitude
though
as
the
habit
of
taking
snuff
had
but
just
come
into
vogue
there
were
no
collections
of
them
and
no
beau
had
ever
dreamed
of
criticizing
a
box
as
did
lord
petersham
as
nice
summer
box
those
of
the
middle
classes
were
chiefly
of
silver
or
or
sometimes
of
or
with
a
stone
in
the
lid
a
beau
would
sometimes
either
have
a
or
the
portrait
of
a
lady
inside
the
lid
and
who
was
the
gratified
centlivre
a
masculine
looking
female
with
a
talent
for
a
tendency
to
appear
in
men
parts
and
last
but
far
from
least
a
nice
little
wen
adorning
her
left
eyelid
she
possessed
other
characteristics
too
but
those
herein
mentioned
are
the
only
ones
which
stand
out
clearly
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
two
centuries
this
doughty
woman
had
been
married
twice
before
she
went
to
windsor
where
she
once
more
entered
into
the
matrimonial
noose
or
rather
again
inveigled
an
unfortunate
into
that
treacherous
device
the
visit
to
the
seat
of
royalty
was
signalised
by
her
acting
of
alexander
the
great
but
from
the
atmosphere
of
kings
and
queens
she
passed
without
a
murmur
to
the
humbler
air
of
a
kitchen
in
other
words
she
married
a
centlivre
chief
cook
to
her
majesty
queen
anne
and
the
pope
would
refer
to
her
later
on
as
the
cook
wife
in
buckingham
court
she
might
indeed
be
a
wife
but
she
knew
how
to
write
with
vivacity
and
produced
many
an
entertaining
play
among
them
were
a
bold
stroke
for
a
wife
and
the
wonder
that
comedy
which
garrick
would
so
relish
in
after
years
the
nature
of
the
aforesaid
wonder
was
explained
in
the
satirical
reflection
of
the
secondary
title
a
woman
keeps
a
secret
and
centlivre
had
this
to
say
in
her
epilogue
upon
the
mooted
question
of
feminine
loquacity
keep
a
secret
says
a
beau
and
sneers
at
some
wit
below
but
faith
if
we
should
tell
but
half
we
know
there
many
a
spruce
young
fellow
in
this
place
wou
never
presume
to
show
his
face
women
are
not
so
weak
what
men
prate
how
many
beaux
have
had
the
fate
from
mama
secrets
their
estate
who
if
her
early
folly
had
made
known
had
rid
behind
the
coach
that
now
their
own
oldfield
received
fresh
cause
for
nervousness
had
she
been
of
a
timid
temperament
when
some
years
later
during
the
season
of
cibber
political
play
of
the
was
brought
out
the
comedy
was
a
blow
aimed
at
the
jacobites
and
the
pretender
who
had
met
with
such
disastrous
treatment
in
the
rebellion
of
and
was
a
laudation
of
the
hanoverian
dynasty
a
footnote
a
the
piece
was
published
and
dedicated
to
george
who
acknowledged
his
sense
of
the
honour
by
paying
to
cibber
the
sum
of
two
hundred
guineas
that
the
good
old
prejudice
against
the
stage
was
still
in
full
force
despite
the
march
of
liberal
ideas
is
clearly
shown
in
the
author
address
to
the
king
your
comedians
sir
are
an
unhappy
society
whom
some
severe
heads
think
wholly
useless
and
others
dangerous
to
the
young
and
innocent
this
comedy
is
therefore
an
attempt
to
remove
that
prejudice
and
to
show
what
honest
and
laudable
uses
may
be
made
of
the
theatre
when
its
performances
keep
close
to
the
true
purposes
of
its
institution
cibber
also
referred
to
himself
as
the
lowest
of
your
subjects
from
the
theatre
and
thus
mirrored
the
servility
of
the
golden
georgian
era
about
this
time
writes
cibber
telling
of
the
play
presentation
jacobitism
had
lately
exerted
itself
by
the
most
unprovoked
rebellion
that
our
histories
have
handed
down
to
us
since
the
norman
conquest
i
therefore
thought
that
to
set
the
authors
and
principles
of
that
desperate
folly
in
a
fair
light
by
allowing
the
mistaken
consciences
of
some
their
best
excuse
and
by
making
the
artful
pretenders
to
conscience
as
ridiculous
as
they
were
ungratefully
wicked
was
a
subject
fit
for
the
honest
satire
of
comedy
and
what
might
if
it
succeeded
do
honour
to
the
stage
by
showing
the
valuable
use
of
it
and
considering
what
numbers
at
that
time
might
come
to
it
as
prejudiced
spectators
it
may
be
allow
that
the
undertaking
was
not
less
hazardous
than
laudable
and
hazardous
the
project
certainly
seemed
for
while
the
uprising
in
the
interests
of
the
pretender
had
been
ostensibly
crushed
the
spirit
of
divine
right
was
as
strong
as
ever
there
were
many
worthy
gentlemen
who
drank
secret
bumpers
to
the
king
over
the
water
and
the
hanoverian
throne
had
as
yet
a
precarious
lodgment
on
english
soil
it
was
expected
therefore
that
these
malcontents
would
have
anything
but
an
appetite
for
the
theatrical
feast
set
before
them
in
the
shape
of
the
and
would
prove
none
the
less
disgusted
because
the
play
happened
to
be
an
adaptation
of
moliÃ¨re
tartuffe
as
the
latter
comedy
depicts
a
crawling
hypocrite
of
the
worst
type
and
is
an
eloquent
sermon
against
sham
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
jacobites
were
not
over
enthusiastic
when
they
learned
that
the
moral
of
tartuffe
was
to
be
applied
to
them
a
footnote
a
tartuffe
according
to
french
tradition
is
a
caricature
of
the
famous
pÃ¨re
la
chaise
confessor
to
louis
quatorze
who
had
a
weakness
for
the
pleasures
of
the
table
including
truffles
tartuffes
after
cibber
day
moliÃ¨re
play
was
again
adapted
into
english
under
the
title
of
the
hypocrite
upon
the
hypocrisy
of
the
french
character
explains
cibber
who
probably
looked
upon
france
papacy
and
the
pretender
as
a
threefold
combination
of
sin
i
engrafted
a
stronger
wickedness
that
of
an
english
popish
priest
lurking
under
the
doctrine
of
our
own
church
to
raise
his
fortune
upon
the
ruin
of
a
worthy
gentleman
whom
his
dissembled
sanctity
had
seduc
into
the
treasonable
cause
of
a
roman
catholick
outlaw
how
this
design
in
the
play
was
executed
i
refer
to
the
readers
of
it
it
can
not
be
mended
by
any
critical
remarks
i
can
make
in
its
favour
let
it
speak
for
itself
the
did
speak
for
itself
too
and
that
in
decided
terms
a
the
production
entailed
the
scorn
of
the
disaffected
and
made
for
cibber
some
lasting
enemies
but
the
friends
of
government
were
strong
cibber
was
lauded
for
his
loyalty
and
the
comedy
achieved
a
triumph
the
vivacity
of
oldfield
acting
as
maria
delighted
all
beholders
and
it
was
further
agreed
that
the
performance
was
well
given
throughout
in
the
cast
were
booth
mills
wilks
cibber
porter
oldfield
and
walker
the
walker
here
mentioned
was
at
that
time
a
very
young
man
not
over
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
and
made
his
first
hit
in
the
when
the
beggars
opera
was
subsequently
brought
out
the
mighty
quin
refused
to
play
the
highwayman
macheath
and
walker
willingly
took
the
part
and
made
therein
the
reputation
of
his
life
but
success
turned
his
unsteady
head
he
follow
bacchus
too
ardently
insomuch
that
his
credit
was
often
drown
upon
the
stage
and
by
degrees
almost
render
him
useless
ungrammatical
but
to
the
point
chetwood
footnote
a
the
success
surpassed
even
expectation
it
raised
against
cibber
a
phalanx
of
implacable
foes
foes
who
howled
at
everything
of
which
he
was
afterwards
the
author
but
it
gained
for
him
his
advancement
to
the
and
an
estimation
which
caused
some
people
to
place
him
for
usefulness
to
the
cause
of
true
religion
on
an
equality
with
the
author
of
the
whole
duty
of
dr
doran
this
walker
was
a
genius
in
a
small
fashion
he
possessed
an
expressive
face
and
manly
figure
with
a
native
buoyancy
and
humour
which
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
the
character
of
macheath
while
he
had
the
further
gift
of
dominating
a
tragic
scene
with
an
assumption
of
tyrannic
fire
which
must
have
been
greatly
admired
by
the
of
his
time
he
could
not
sing
to
be
sure
when
he
graced
the
beggars
opera
but
the
audiences
took
the
will
for
the
deed
applauded
his
gaiety
of
action
and
quickly
pardoned
his
lyric
we
are
equally
lenient
nowadays
to
many
a
comedian
so
called
chetwood
tells
us
that
walker
was
the
supposed
author
of
two
pieces
the
quakers
opera
and
a
tragedy
styled
the
fate
of
villainy
the
latter
it
appears
he
brought
to
ireland
in
the
year
and
prevailed
on
the
proprietors
of
the
dublin
theatre
to
act
it
under
the
title
of
and
loyalty
the
second
night
was
given
out
for
his
benefit
but
not
being
able
to
pay
in
half
the
charge
of
the
common
expences
the
doors
were
order
to
be
kept
shut
but
i
remember
laconically
adds
chetwood
few
people
came
to
ask
the
reason
however
i
fear
this
disappointment
hasten
his
death
for
he
survived
it
but
three
days
dying
in
the
year
of
his
age
a
martyr
to
what
often
stole
from
him
a
good
understanding
he
who
delights
in
drinking
out
of
season
takes
pains
to
drown
his
manly
reason
poor
walker
he
is
not
the
only
actor
who
has
perished
from
a
mixture
of
wine
and
injured
vanity
to
return
to
the
success
of
the
cibber
writes
all
the
reason
i
had
to
think
it
no
bad
performance
was
that
it
was
acted
eighteen
days
running
and
that
the
party
that
were
hurt
by
it
as
i
have
been
told
have
not
been
the
smallest
number
of
my
back
friends
ever
since
but
happy
was
it
for
this
play
that
the
very
subject
was
its
protection
a
few
smiles
of
silent
contempt
were
the
utmost
disgrace
that
on
the
first
day
of
its
appearance
it
was
thought
safe
to
throw
upon
it
as
the
satire
was
chiefly
employ
on
the
enemies
of
the
government
they
were
not
so
hardy
as
to
own
themselves
such

any
higher
disapprobation
or
resentment
a

very
day
that
this
obituary
appeared
cibber
crawled
out
of
the
house
but
convalescent
and
read
the
notice
with
keen
interest
whether
he
was
amused
thereat
or
dubbed
the
joke
a
poor
one
is
a
matter
which
he
does
not
record
but
he
tells
us
that
he
saw
no
use
in
being
thought
to
be
thoroughly
dead
before
his
time
and
therefore
had
a
mind
to
see
whether
the
town
cared
to
have
him
alive
again
so
the
play
of
the
being
to
be
acted
that
day
i
quietly
stole
myself
into
the
part
of
the
chaplain
which
i
had
not
been
seen
in
for
many
years
before
the
surprise
of
the
audience
at
my
unexpected
appearance
on
the
very
day
i
had
been
dead
in
the
news
and
the
paleness
of
my
looks
seem
to
make
it
a
doubt
whether
i
was
not
the
ghost
of
my
real
self
departed
but
when
i
spoke
their
wonder
eas
itself
by
an
applause
which
convinc
me
they
were
then
satisfied
that
my
friend
mist
had
told
a
fib
of
me
now
if
simply
to
have
shown
myself
in
broad
life
and
about
my
business
after
he
had
notoriously
reported
me
dead
can
be
called
a
reply
it
was
the
only
one
which
his
paper
while
alive
ever
drew
from
me
the
jacobites
could
not
interfere
with
the
triumph
of
the
but
they
were
shrewd
enough
to
bide
their
time
that
time
came
as
they
thought
in
when
there
was
unfolded
at
drury
lane
a
comedy
which
became
famous
under
the
title
of
the
provoked
husband
the
rough
draft
of
the
play
was
the
work
of
vanbrugh
now
dead
but
the
dialogue
and
situations
had
been
elaborated
by
cibber
here
was
a
chance
therefore
to
damn
the
latter
writer
and
accordingly
the
malcontents
repaired
to
the
theatre
hissed
the
performance
roundly
and
then
went
home
with
the
comfortable
reflection
that
they
had
gotten
their
revenge
their
revenge
however
was
shortlived
for
the
general
public
liked
the
comedy
and
soon
flocked
to
its
rescue
on
the
first
day
of
provok
husband
says
the
poet
laureate
ten
years
after
the
had
appear
a
powerful
party
not
having
the
fear
of
publick
offence
or
private
injury
before
their
eyes
appeared
most
impetuously
concerned
for
the
demolition
of
it
in
which
they
so
far
succeeded
that
for
some
time
i
gave
it
up
for
lost
and
to
follow
their
blows
in
the
publick
papers
of
the
next
day
it
was
attack
and
triumph
over
as
a
dead
and
damn
piece
a
swinging
criticism
was
made
upon
it
in
general
invective
terms
for
they
disdain
to
trouble
the
world
with
particulars
their
sentence
it
seems
was
proof
enough
of
its
deserving
the
fate
it
had
met
with
but
this
damn
play
was
notwithstanding
acted
nights
together
and
left
off
at
a
receipt
of
upwards
of
a
hundred
and
forty
pounds
which
happened
to
be
more
than
in
fifty
years
before
could
be
then
said
of
any
one
play
whatsoever
the
play
was
saved
and
no
one
contributed
more
importantly
to
that
result
than
did
mistress
oldfield
her
acting
as
the
heroine
lady
townley
was
pronounced
superb
and
though
she
had
now
drifted
into
was
she
not
over
forty
nance
still
seemed
on
the
stage
at
least
the
incarnation
of
youth
and
grace
is
there
not
a
certain
english
actress
now
living
one
who
plays
nance
oldfield
and
suggests
her
as
well
who
defies
the
inroads
of
time
with
equal
carelessness
a
footnote
a
in
the
wearing
of
her
person
she
oldfield
was
particularly
fortunate
her
figure
was
always
improving
to
her
year
but
her
excellence
in
acting
was
never
at
a
stand
and
lady
townley
one
of
her
last
new
parts
was
a
proof
that
she
was
still
able
to
do
more
if
more
could
have
been
done
for
genest
lady
townley
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
glorified
matured
edition
of
lady
betty
modish
and
therefore
a
very
charming
woman
charming
at
least
on
the
boards
of
a
theatre
if
not
upon
the
floor
of
a
real
for
she
has
a
love
of
pleasure
which
can
hardly
be
called
domestic
and
her
unfortunate
husband
who
would
see
more
of
her
is
tempted
to
ask
in
the
very
first
scene
of
the
play
why
did
i
marry
while
she
admits
no
lover
lord
townley
soliloquises
for
my
lady
is
at
least
virtuous
she
thinks
it
a
greater
merit
still
in
her
chastity
not
to
care
for
her
husband
and
while
she
herself
is
solacing
in
one
continual
round
of
cards
and
good
company
he
poor
wretch
is
left
at
large
to
take
care
of
his
own
contentment
is
time
indeed
some
care
were
taken
and
speedily
there
shall
be
yet
let
me
not
be
rash
perhaps
this
disappointment
of
my
heart
may
make
me
too
impatient
and
some
tempers
when
reproach
grow
more
untractable
and
when
lady
townley
all
graces
and
ribbons
and
laces
enters
on
the
scene
my
lord
meekly
asks
going
out
so
soon
after
dinner
madam
lady
lord
my
lord
what
can
i
possibly
do
at
home
lord
what
does
my
sister
lady
grace
do
at
home
lady
why
that
is
to
me
amazing
have
you
ever
any
pleasure
at
home
lord
it
might
be
in
your
power
madam
i
confess
to
make
it
a
little
more
comfortable
to
me
lady
comfortable
and
so
my
good
lord
you
would
really
have
a
woman
of
my
rank
and
spirit
stay
at
home
to
comfort
her
husband
lord
what
notions
of
life
some
men
have
lord
do
you
think
madam
some
ladies
notions
are
full
as
extravagant
lady
yes
my
lord
when
tame
doves
live
cooped
within
the
pen
of
your
precepts
i
do
think
prodigious
indeed
lord
and
when
they
fly
wild
about
this
town
madam
pray
what
must
the
world
think
of
then
lady
oh
this
world
is
not
so
ill
bred
as
to
quarrel
with
any
woman
for
liking
it
lord
nor
am
i
madam
a
husband
so
well
bred
as
to
bear
my
being
so
fond
of
it
in
short
the
life
you
lead
madam
lady
is
to
me
the
pleasantest
life
in
the
world
lord
i
should
not
dispute
your
taste
madam
if
a
woman
had
a
right
to
please
nobody
but
herself
lady
why
whom
would
you
have
her
please
lord
sometimes
her
husband
lady
and
do
you
think
a
husband
under
the
same
obligation
lord
certainly
lady
why
then
we
are
agreed
my
lord
for
if
i
never
go
abroad
till
i
am
weary
of
being
at
home
which
you
know
is
the
case
is
it
not
equally
reasonable
not
to
come
home
till
one
a
weary
of
being
abroad
lord
if
this
be
your
rule
of
life
madam
is
time
to
ask
you
one
serious
question
lady
do
let
it
be
long
acoming
then
for
i
am
in
haste
lord
madam
when
i
am
serious
i
expect
a
serious
answer
lady
before
i
know
the
question
here
we
can
imagine
wilks
who
played
lord
townley
waxing
exceeding
wroth
at
my
lady
lord
pshah
have
i
power
madam
to
make
you
serious
by
intreaty
lady
you
have
lord
and
you
promise
to
answer
me
sincerely
lady
sincerely
lord
now
then
recollect
your
thoughts
and
tell
me
seriously
why
you
married
me
lady
you
insist
upon
truth
you
say
lord
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
it
lady
why
then
my
lord
to
give
you
at
once
a
proof
of
my
obedience
and
sincerity
i
think
i
married
to
take
off
that
restraint
that
lay
upon
my
pleasures
while
i
was
a
single
woman
lord
how
madam
is
any
woman
under
less
restraint
after
marriage
than
before
it
lady
o
my
lord
my
lord
they
are
quite
different
creatures
wives
have
infinite
liberties
in
life
that
would
be
terrible
in
an
unmarried
woman
to
take
lord
name
one
lady
fifty
if
you
please
to
begin
then
in
the
morning
a
married
women
may
have
men
at
her
toilet
invite
them
to
dinner
appoint
them
a
party
in
a
stage
box
at
the
play
engross
the
conversation
there
call
by
their
christian
names
talk
louder
than
the
players
from
thence
jaunt
into
the
city
take
a
frolicksome
supper
at
an
india
house
perhaps
in
her
de
toast
a
pretty
fellow
then
clatter
again
to
this
end
of
the
town
break
with
the
morning
into
an
assembly
crowd
to
the
hazard
table
throw
a
familiar
levant
upon
some
sharp
lurching
man
of
quality
and
if
he
demands
his
money
turn
it
off
with
a
loud
laugh
and
cry
you
owe
it
to
him
to
vex
him
ha
ha
lord
prodigious
it
is
related
that
so
magnificently
did
oldfield
describe
the
pleasures
of
a
woman
of
fashion
that
the
audience
echoed
with
a
different
meaning
lord
townley
comment
and
showered
her
with
plaudits
prodigious
indeed
must
have
been
her
acting
nance
was
even
more
captivating
as
the
comedy
progressed
and
nowhere
did
she
shine
more
brilliantly
it
may
be
supposed
than
in
the
following
scene
lady
townley
well
look
you
my
lord
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
nothing
still
but
about
my
faults
my
faults
an
agreeable
subject
truly
lord
why
madam
if
you
wo
hear
of
them
how
can
i
ever
hope
to
see
you
mend
them
lady
why
i
do
intend
to
mend
them
i
ca
mend
them
you
know
i
have
try
to
do
it
an
hundred
times
and
it
hurts
me
so
i
bear
it
lord
and
i
madam
ca
bear
this
daily
licentious
abuse
of
your
time
and
character
lady
abuse
astonishing
when
the
universe
knows
i
am
never
better
company
than
when
i
am
doing
what
i
have
a
mind
to
but
to
see
this
world
that
men
can
never
get
over
that
silly
spirit
of
contradiction
why
but
last
thursday
now
there
you
wisely
amended
one
of
my
faults
as
you
call
them
you
insisted
upon
my
not
going
to
the
masquerade
and
pray
what
was
the
consequence
was
not
i
as
cross
as
the
devil
all
the
night
after
was
not
i
forc
to
get
company
at
home
and
was
it
not
almost
three
in
the
morning
before
i
was
able
to
come
to
myself
again
and
then
the
fault
is
not
mended
neither
for
next
time
i
shall
only
have
twice
the
inclination
to
go
so
that
all
this
mending
and
mending
you
see
is
but
darning
an
old
ruffle
to
make
it
worse
than
it
was
before
lord
well
the
manner
of
women
living
of
late
is
insupportable
and
one
way
or
other
lady
it
to
be
mended
i
suppose
why
so
it
may
but
then
my
dear
lord
you
must
give
one
time
and
when
things
are
at
worst
you
know
they
may
mend
themselves
ha
ha
lord
madam
i
am
not
in
a
humour
now
to
trifle
lady
why
then
my
lord
one
word
of
fair
argument
to
talk
with
you
your
own
way
now
you
complain
of
my
late
hours
and
i
of
your
early
ones
so
far
we
are
even
you
allow
but
pray
which
gives
us
the
best
figure
in
the
eye
of
the
polite
world
my
active
spirited
three
in
the
morning
or
your
dull
drowsy
eleven
at
night
now
i
think
one
has
the
air
of
a
woman
of
quality
and
of
a
plodding
mechanic
that
goes
to
bed
betimes
that
he
may
rise
early
to
open
his
shop
faugh
lord
fy
fy
madam
is
this
your
way
of
reasoning
is
time
to
wake
you
then
is
not
your
ill
hours
alone
that
disturb
me
but
as
often
the
ill
company
that
occasion
those
ill
hours
lady
sure
i
do
understand
you
now
my
lord
what
ill
company
do
i
keep
lord
why
at
best
women
that
lose
their
money
and
men
that
win
it
or
perhaps
men
that
are
voluntary
bubbles
at
one
game
in
hopes
a
lady
will
give
them
fair
play
at
another
a
then
that
unavoidable
mixture
with
known
rakes
conceal
thieves
and
sharpers
in
embroidery
or
what
to
me
is
still
more
shocking
that
herd
of
familiar
chattering
coxcombs
who
are
so
often
like
monkeys
there
would
be
no
knowing
them
asunder
but
that
their
tails
hang
from
their
head
and
the
monkey
grows
where
it
should
do
footnote
a
women
gambled
as
passionately
as
did
the
men
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
ashton
quotes
the
following
from
the
gaming
lady
she
a
profuse
lady
tho
of
a
miserly
temper
whose
covetous
disposition
is
the
very
cause
of
her
extravagancy
for
the
desire
of
success
wheedles
her
ladyship
to
play
and
the
incident
charges
and
disappointments
that
attend
it
make
her
as
expensive
to
her
husband
as
his
coach
and
six
horses
when
an
unfortunate
night
has
happen
to
empty
her
cabinet
she
has
many
shifts
to
replenish
her
pockets
her
jewels
are
carry
privately
into
lombard
street
and
fortune
is
to
be
tempted
the
next
night
with
another
sum
borrowed
of
my
lady
goldsmith
at
the
extortion
of
a
pawnbroker
and
if
that
fails
then
she
sells
off
her
wardrobe
to
the
great
grief
of
her
maids
stretches
her
credit
amongst
those
she
deals
with
or
makes
her
waiting
woman
dive
into
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
and
lug
out
her
green
net
purse
full
of
old
jacobuses
in
hopes
to
recover
her
losses
by
a
turn
of
fortune
that
she
may
conceal
her
bad
luck
from
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
lady
and
a
husband
must
give
eminent
proof
of
his
sense
that
thinks
their
powder
puffs
dangerous
lord
their
being
fools
madam
is
not
always
the
security
or
if
it
were
fortune
sometimes
gives
them
advantages
might
make
a
thinking
woman
tremble
lady
what
do
you
mean
lord
that
women
sometimes
lose
more
than
they
are
able
to
pay
and
if
a
creditor
be
a
little
pressing
the
lady
may
be
reduced
to
try
if
instead
of
gold
the
gentleman
will
accept
of
a
trinket
lady
my
lord
you
grow
scurrilous
you
make
me
hate
you
have
you
to
know
i
keep
company
with
the
politest
people
in
town
and
the
assemblies
i
frequent
are
full
of
such
lord
so
are
the
churches
now
and
then
lady
my
friends
frequent
them
too
as
well
as
the
assemblies
lord
yes
and
would
do
it
oftener
if
a
groom
of
the
chambers
there
were
allowed
to
furnish
cards
to
the
company
lady
i
see
what
you
drive
at
all
this
while
you
would
lay
an
imputation
on
my
fame
to
cover
your
own
avarice
i
might
take
any
pleasures
i
find
that
were
not
expensive
lord
have
a
care
madam
do
let
me
think
you
only
value
your
chastity
to
make
me
reproachable
for
not
indulging
you
in
everything
else
that
vicious
i
madam
have
a
reputation
too
to
guard
dear
to
me
as
yours
the
follies
of
an
ungoverned
wife
may
make
the
wisest
man
uneasy
but
is
his
own
fault
if
ever
they
make
him
contemptible
lady
my
lord
you
make
a
woman
mad
lord
you
make
a
man
a
fool
lady
if
heaven
has
made
you
otherwise
that
wo
be
in
my
power
lord
whatever
may
be
in
your
inclination
madam
i
prevent
you
making
me
a
beggar
at
least
lady
a
beggar
croesus
i
out
of
patience
i
wo
come
home
till
four
morning
lord
that
may
be
madam
but
i
order
the
doors
to
be
locked
at
twelve
lady
then
i
wo
come
home
till
night
lord
then
madam
you
shall
never
come
home
again
lord
townley
in
the
end
of
course
lady
townley
is
converted
to
the
pleasures
of
domesticity
and
ends
the
comedy
by
saying
so
visible
the
bliss
so
plain
the
way
how
was
it
possible
my
sense
could
stray
but
now
a
convert
to
this
truth
i
come
that
married
happiness
is
never
found
from
home
perhaps
when
oldfield
delivered
these
virtuous
lines
she
thought
to
herself
that
happiness
even
of
the
unmarried
kind
was
never
very
far
away
from
home
but
she
forgot
sentiment
when
she

her

you

she
looks
not

the

may

records
that
lady
townley
was
universally
regarded
as
oldfield
plus
in
acting
she
slided
so
gracefully
into
the
foibles
and
displayed
so
humorously
the
excesses
of
a
fine
woman
too
sensible
of
her
charms
too
confident
in
her
strength
and
led
away
by
her
pleasures
that
no
succeeding
lady
townley
arrived
at
her
many
distinguished
excellencies
in
the
character
a
and
the
writer
goes
on
to
say
that
by
being
a
welcome
and
constant
visitor
to
families
of
distinction
oldfield
acquired
a
graceful
carriage
in
representing
women
of
high
rank
and
expressed
their
sentiments
in
a
manner
so
easy
natural
and
flowing
that
they
appeared
to
be
of
her
own
genuine
utterance
pray
sir
what
is
there
so
remarkable
about

the

the

soon
be
rung
down

ever

the

drury

her
no

health
began
to
follow
in
her
once
careless
path
and
there
were
times
when
the
duties
of
acting
seemed
almost
unbearable
yet
she
was
a
brave
woman
and
kept
a
merry
front
to
the
audience
although
she
was
obliged
on
occasions
to
turn
away
from

left

if

what
auditor

roscommon
among
the
several
artifices
which
are
put
in
practice
by
the
poets
to
fill
the
minds
of
an
audience
with
terror
the
first
place
is
due
to
thunder
and
lightning
which
are
often
made
use
of
at
the
descending
of
a
god
or
the
rising
of
a
ghost
at
the
vanishing
of
a
devil
or
at
the
death
of
a
tyrant
i
have
known
a
bell
introduced
into
several
tragedies
with
good
effect
and
have
seen
the
whole
assembly
in
a
very
great
alarm
all
the
while
it
has
been
ringing
but
there
is
nothing
which
delights
and
terrifies
our
english
theatre
so
much
as
a
ghost
especially
when
he
appears
in
a
bloody
shirt
a
spectre
has
very
often
saved
a
play
though
he
has
done
nothing
but
stalked
across
the
stage
or
rose
through
a
cleft
of
it
and
sunk
again
without
speaking
one
word
there
may
be
a
proper
season
for
these
several
terrors
and
when
they
only
come
in
as
aids
and
assistances
to
the
poet
they
are
not
only
to
be
excused
but
to
be
applauded
thus
the
sounding
of
the
clock
in
venice
preserved
makes
the
hearts
of
the
whole
audience
quake
and
conveys
a
stronger
terror
to
the
mind
than
it
is
possible
for
words
to
do
the
appearance
of
the
ghost
in
hamlet
is
a
masterpiece
in
its
kind
and
wrought
up
with
all
the
circumstances
that
can
create
either
attention
or
horror
the
mind
of
the
reader
is
wonderfully
prepared
for
his
reception
by
the
discourses
that
precede
it
his
dumb
behaviour
at
his
first
entrance
strikes
the
imagination
very
strongly
but
every
time
he
enters
he
is
still
more
terrifying
who
can
read
the
speech
with
which
young
hamlet
accosts
him
without
trembling

the

and

thee
up

what

this

that
thou
dead
corse
again
in
complete
steel
thus
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
making
night
hideous
i
do
not
therefore
find
fault
with
the
artifices
above
mentioned
when
they
are
introduced
with
skill
and
accompanied
by
proportionable
sentiments
and
expressions
in
the
writings
for
the
moving
of
pity
our
principal
machine
is
the
handkerchief
and
indeed
in
our
common
tragedies
we
should
not
know
very
often
that
the
persons
are
in
distress
by
anything
they
say
if
they
did
not
from
time
to
time
apply
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
far
be
it
from
me
to
think
of
banishing
this
instrument
of
sorrow
from
the
stage
i
know
a
tragedy
could
not
subsist
without
it
all
that
i
would
contend
for
is
to
keep
it
from
being
misapplied
in
a
word
i
would
have
the
actor
tongue
sympathise
with
his
eyes
a
disconsolate
mother
with
a
child
in
her
hand
has
frequently
drawn
compassion
from
the
audience
and
has
therefore
gained
a
place
in
several
tragedies
a
modern
writer
that
observed
how
this
had
took
in
other
plays
being
resolved
to
double
the
distress
and
melt
his
audience
twice
as
much
as
those
before
him
had
done
brought
a
princess
upon
the
stage
with
a
little
boy
in
one
hand
and
a
girl
in
the
other
this
too
had
a
very
good
effect
a
third
poet
being
resolved
to
outwrite
all
his
predecessors
a
few
years
ago
introduced
three
children
with
great
success
and
as
i
am
informed
a
young
gentleman
who
is
fully
determined
to
break
the
most
obdurate
hearts
has
a
tragedy
by
him
where
the
first
person
that
appears
upon
the
stage
is
an
afflicted
widow
in
her
mourning
weeds
with
half
a
dozen
fatherless
children
attending
her
like
those
that
usually
hang
about
the
figure
of
charity
thus
several
incidents
that
are
beautiful
in
a
good
writer
become
ridiculous
by
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
bad
one
but
among
all
our
methods
of
moving
pity
or
terror
there
is
none
so
absurd
and
barbarous
and
which
more
exposes
us
to
the
contempt
and
ridicule
of
our
neighbours
than
that
dreadful
butchering
of
one
another
which
is
very
frequent
upon
the
english
stage
to
delight
in
seeing
men
stabbed
poisoned
racked
or
impaled
is
certainly
the
sign
of
a
cruel
temper
and
as
this
is
often
practised
before
the
british
audience
several
french
critics
who
think
these
are
grateful
spectacles
to
us
take
occasion
from
them
to
represent
us
as
a
people
who
delight
in
blood
it
is
indeed
very
odd
to
see
our
stage
strewed
with
carcasses
in
the
last
scenes
of
a
tragedy
and
to
observe
in
the
wardrobe
of
the
playhouse
several
daggers
poniards
wheels
bowls
for
poison
and
many
other
instruments
of
death
murders
and
executions
are
always
transacted
behind
the
scenes
in
the
french
theatre
which
in
general
is
very
agreeable
to
the
manners
of
a
polite
and
civilised
people
but
as
there
are
no
exceptions
to
this
rule
on
the
french
stage
it
leads
them
into
absurdities
almost
as
ridiculous
as
that
which
falls
under
our
present
censure
i
remember
in
the
famous
play
of
corneille
written
upon
the
subject
of
the
horatii
and
curiatii
the
fierce
young
hero
who
had
overcome
the
curiatii
one
after
another
instead
of
being
congratulated
by
his
sister
for
his
victory
being
upbraided
by
her
for
having
slain
her
lover
in
the
height
of
his
passion
and
resentment
kills
her
if
anything
could
extenuate
so
brutal
an
action
it
would
be
the
doing
of
it
on
a
sudden
before
the
sentiments
of
nature
reason
or
manhood
could
take
place
in
him
however
to
avoid
public
bloodshed
as
soon
as
his
passion
is
wrought
to
its
height
he
follows
his
sister
the
whole
length
of
the
stage
and
forbears
killing
her
till
they
are
both
withdrawn
behind
the
scenes
i
must
confess
had
he
murdered
her
before
the
audience
the
indecency
might
have
been
greater
but
as
it
is
it
appears
very
unnatural
and
looks
like
killing
in
cold
blood
to
give
my
opinion
upon
this
case
the
fact
ought
not
to
have
been
represented
but
to
have
been
told
if
there
was
any
occasion
for
it
it
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
reader
to
see
how
sophocles
has
conducted
a
tragedy
under
the
like
delicate
circumstance
orestes
was
in
the
same
condition
with
hamlet
in
shakespeare
his
mother
having
murdered
his
father
and
taken
possession
of
his
kingdom
in
conspiracy
with
her
adulterer
that
young
prince
therefore
being
determined
to
revenge
his
father
death
upon
those
who
filled
his
throne
conveys
himself
by
a
beautiful
stratagem
into
his
mother
apartment
with
a
resolution
to
kill
her
but
because
such
a
spectacle
would
have
been
too
shocking
to
the
audience
this
dreadful
resolution
is
executed
behind
the
scenes
the
mother
is
heard
calling
to
her
son
for
mercy
and
the
son
answering
her
that
she
showed
no
mercy
to
his
father
after
which
she
shrieks
out
that
she
is
wounded
and
by
what
follows
we
find
that
she
is
slain
i
do
not
remember
that
in
any
of
our
plays
there
are
speeches
made
behind
the
scenes
though
there
are
other
instances
of
this
nature
to
be
met
with
in
those
of
the
ancients
and
i
believe
my
reader
will
agree
with
me
that
there
is
something
infinitely
more
affecting
in
this
dreadful
dialogue
between
the
mother
and
her
son
behind
the
scenes
than
could
have
been
in
anything
transacted
before
the
audience
orestes
immediately
after
meets
the
usurper
at
the
entrance
of
his
palace
and
by
a
very
happy
thought
of
the
poet
avoids
killing
him
before
the
audience
by
telling
him
that
he
should
live
some
time
in
his
present
bitterness
of
soul
before
he
would
despatch
him
and
by
ordering
him
to
retire
into
that
part
of
the
palace
where
he
had
slain
his
father
whose
murder
he
would
revenge
in
the
very
same
place
where
it
was
committed
by
this
means
the
poet
observes
that
decency
which
horace
afterwards
established
as
a
rule
of
forbearing
to
commit
parricides
or
unnatural
murders
before
the
audience

ars
poet
ver
let
not
medea

her

and
spill
her

roscommon
the
french
have
therefore
refined
too
much
upon
horace
rule
who
never
designed
to
banish
all
kinds
of
death
from
the
stage
but
only
such
as
had
too
much
horror
in
them
and
which
would
have
a
better
effect
upon
the
audience
when
transacted
behind
the
scenes
i
would
therefore
recommend
to
my
countrymen
the
practice
of
the
ancient
poets
who
were
very
sparing
of
their
public
executions
and
rather
chose
to
perform
them
behind
the
scenes
if
it
could
be
done
with
as
great
an
effect
upon
the
audience
at
the
same
time
i
must
observe
that
though
the
devoted
persons
of
the
tragedy
were
seldom
slain
before
the
audience
which
has
generally
something
ridiculous
in
it
their
bodies
were
often
produced
after
their
death
which
has
always
in
it
something
melancholy
or
terrifying
so
that
the
killing
on
the
stage
does
not
seem
to
have
been
avoided
only
as
an
indecency
but
also
as
an
improbability

through

to

by

to

it
some
of
which
i
could
wish
entirely
rejected
and
the
rest
to
be
used
with
caution

would
be
an
endless
task

consider
comedy

raise

of
this
effect

in

a
broad
and

are
different
characters
sometimes
the
wit
of
a
scene
lies
in
a
and
sometimes
in
a

of
whiskers
a

running
about
the

because
ridicule

delicate
as
compassion

because
the

infinitely
more
numerous
than
those

there
is
a
much
greater

than

greater
indulgence

allowed
them

i
had
the

the

of
sitting
very
near
you
and
your
worthy
friend
sir
roger
at
the
acting
of
the
new
tragedy
which
you
have
in
a
late
paper
or
two
so
justly
recommended
i
was
highly
pleased
with
the
advantageous
situation
fortune
had
given
me
in
placing
me
so
near
two
gentlemen
from
one
of
which
i
was
sure
to
hear
such
reflections
on
the
several
incidents
of
the
play
as
pure
nature
suggested
and
from
the
other
such
as
flowed
from
the
exactest
art
and
judgment
though
i
must
confess
that
my
curiosity
led
me
so
much
to
observe
the
knight
reflections
that
i
was
not
so
well
at
leisure
to
improve
myself
by
yours
nature
i
found
played
her
part
in
the
knight
pretty
well
till
at
the
last
concluding
lines
she
entirely
forsook
him
you
must
know
sir
that
it
is
always
my
custom
when
i
have
been
well
entertained
at
a
new
tragedy
to
make
my
retreat
before
the
facetious
epilogue
enters
not
but
that
those
pieces
are
often
very
well
writ
but
having
paid
down
my
and
made
a
fair
purchase
of
as
much
of
the
pleasing
melancholy
as
the
poet
art
can
afford
me
or
my
own
nature
admit
of
i
am
willing
to
carry
some
of
it
home
with
me
and
can
not
endure
to
be
at
once
tricked
out
of
all
though
by
the
wittiest
dexterity
in
the
world
however
i
kept
my
seat
the
other
night
in
hopes
of
finding
my
own
sentiments
of
this
matter
favoured
by
your
friend
when
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
the
knight
entering
with
equal
pleasure
into
both
parts
and
as
much
satisfied
with
oldfield
gaiety
as
he
had
been
before
with
andromache
greatness
whether
this
were
no
more
than
an
effect
of
the
knight
peculiar
humanity
pleased
to
find
at
last
that
after
all
the
tragical
doings
everything
was
safe
and
well
i
do
not
know
but
for
my
own
part
i
must
confess
i
was
so
dissatisfied
that
i
was
sorry
the
poet
had
saved
andromache
and
could
heartily
have
wished
that
he
had
left
her
upon
the
stage
for
you
can
not
imagine
spectator
the
mischief
she
was
reserved
to
do
me
i
found
my
soul
during
the
action
gradually
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
and
felt
the
exalted
passion
which
all
generous
minds
conceive
at
the
sight
of
virtue
in
distress
the
impression
believe
me
sir
was
so
strong
upon
me
that
i
am
persuaded
if
i
had
been
let
alone
in
it
i
could
at
an
extremity
have
ventured
to
defend
yourself
and
sir
roger
against
half
a
score
of
the
fiercest
mohocks
but
the
ludicrous
epilogue
in
the
close
extinguished
all
my
ardour
and
made
me
look
upon
all
such
noble
achievements
as
downright
silly
and
romantic
what
the
rest
of
the
audience
felt
i
can
not
so
well
tell
for
myself
i
must
declare
that
at
the
end
of
the
play
i
found
my
soul
uniform
and
all
of
a
piece
but
at
the
end
of
the
epilogue
it
was
so
jumbled
together
and
divided
between
jest
and
earnest
that
if
you
will
forgive
me
an
extravagant
fancy
i
will
here
set
it
down
i
could
not
but
fancy
if
my
soul
had
at
that
moment
quitted
my
body
and
descended
to
the
poetical
shades
in
the
posture
it
was
then
in
what
a
strange
figure
it
would
have
made
among
them
they
would
not
have
known
what
to
have
made
of
my
motley
spectre
half
comic
and
half
tragic
all
over
resembling
a
ridiculous
face
that
at
the
same
time
laughs
on
one
side
and
cries
on
the
other
the
only
defence
i
think
i
have
ever
heard
made
for
this
as
it
seems
to
me
the
most
unnatural
tack
of
the
comic
tail
to
the
tragic
head
is
this
that
the
minds
of
the
audience
must
be
refreshed
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
not
sent
away
to
their
own
homes
with
too
dismal
and
melancholy
thoughts
about
them
for
who
knows
the
consequence
of
this
we
are
much
obliged
indeed
to
poets
for
the
great
tenderness
they
express
for
the
safety
of
our
persons
and
heartily
thank
them
for
it
but
if
that
be
all
pray
good
sir
assure
them
that
we
are
none
of
us
like
to
come
to
any
great
harm
and
that
let
them
do
their
best
we
shall
in
all
probability
live
out
the
length
of
our
days
and
frequent
the
theatres
more
than
ever
what
makes
me
more
desirous
to
have
some
reformation
of
this
matter
is
because
of
an
ill
consequence
or
two
attending
it
for
a
great
many
of
our
church
musicians
being
related
to
the
theatre
they
have
in
imitation
of
these
epilogues
introduced
in
their
farewell
voluntaries
a
sort
of
music
quite
foreign
to
the
design
of
to
the
great
prejudice
of
people
those
fingering
gentlemen
should
be
informed
that
they
ought
to
suit
their
airs
to
the
place
and
business
and
that
the
musician
is
obliged
to
keep
to
the
text
as
much
as
the
preacher
for
want
of
this
i
have
found
by
experience
a
great
deal
of
mischief
for
when
the
preacher
has
often
with
great
piety
and
art
enough
handled
his
subject
and
the
judicious
clerk
has
with
the
utmost
diligence
called
out
two
staves
proper
to
the
discourse
and
i
have
found
in
myself
and
in
the
rest
of
the
pew
good
thoughts
and
dispositions
they
have
been
all
in
a
moment
dissipated
by
a
merry
jig
from
the
organ
loft
one
knows
not
what
further
ill
effects
the
epilogues
i
have
been
speaking
of
may
in
time
produce
but
this
i
am
credibly
informed
of
that
paul
lorrain
a
has
resolved
upon
a
very
sudden
reformation
in
his
tragical
dramas
and
that
at

monthly
performance
he
designs
instead

penitential
psalm

an
epilogue
attacked
in

last
paper
which
has
been
so
generally
applauded
by
the
town
and
received
such
honours
as
were
never
before
given
to
any
in
an
english
theatre
the
audience
would
not
permit
oldfield
to
go
off
the
stage
the
first
night
till
she
had
repeated
it
twice
the
second
night
the
noise
of
was
as
loud
as
before
and
she
was
again
obliged
to
speak
it
twice
the
third
night
it
was
called
for
a
second
time
and
in
short
contrary
to
all
other
epilogues
which
are
dropped
after
the
third
representation
of
the
play
this
has
already
been
repeated
nine
times
i
must
own
i
am
the
more
surprised
to
find
this
censure
in
opposition
to
the
whole
town
in
a
paper
which
has
hitherto
been
famous
for
the
candour
of
its
criticisms
i
can
by
no
means
allow
your
melancholy
correspondent
that
the
new
epilogue
is
unnatural
because
it
is
gay
if
i
had
a
mind
to
be
learned
i
could
tell
him
that
the
prologue
and
epilogue
were
real
parts
of
the
ancient
tragedy
but
every
one
knows
that
on
the
british
stage
they
are
distinct
performances
by
themselves
pieces
entirely
detached
from
the
play
and
no
way
essential
to
it
the
moment
the
play
ends
oldfield
is
no
more

oldfield
and
though
the

had
left
andromache
upon
the

as
your
ingenious

oldfield
might
still
have
spoke

we
have
an
instance
of
this
in
a
tragedy
where
there
is
not
only
a
death
but
a
martyrdom
a
catherine
was
there
personated
by
nell
gwyn
she
lies
upon
the
stage
but
upon
those
gentlemen
offering
to
remove
her
body
whose
business
it
is
to
carry
off
the
slain
in
our
english
tragedies
she
breaks
out
into
that
abrupt
beginning
of
what
was
a
very
ludicrous
but
at
the
same
time
thought
a
very
good
epilogue
are
you
mad
you
damn
confounded
dog
i
am
to
rise
and
speak
the
epilogue
footnote
a
tyrannic
love
or
the
royal
martyr
by
dryden
this
diverting
manner
was
always
practised
by
dryden
who
if
he
was
not
the
best
writer
of
tragedies
in
his
time
was
allowed
by
every
one
to
have
the
happiest
turn
for
a
prologue
or
an
epilogue
the
epilogues
to
sebastian
the
of
guise
and
triumphant
are
all
precedents
of
this
nature
i
might
further
justify
this
practice
by
that
excellent
epilogue
which
was
spoken
a
few
years
since
after
the
tragedy
of
and
hippolitus
a
with
a
great
many
others
in
which
the
authors
have
endeavoured
to
make
the
audience
merry
if
they
have
not
all
succeeded
so
well
as
the
writer
of
this
they
have
however
shown
that
it
was
not
for
want
of
good
will
footnote
a
by

neal
i
must
further
observe
that
the
gaiety
of
it
may
be
still
the
more
proper
as
it
is
at
the
end
of
a
french
play
since
every
one
knows
that
nation
who
are
generally
esteemed
to
have
as
polite
a
taste
as
any
in
europe
always
close
their
tragic
entertainments
with
what
they
call
a
which
is
purposely
designed
to
raise
mirth
and
send
away
the
audience
well
pleased
the
same
person
who
has
supported
the
chief
character
in
the
tragedy
very
often
plays
the
principal
part
in
the
so
that
i
have
myself
seen
at
paris
orestes
and
lubin
acted
the
same
night
by
the
same
man
indeed
you
have
yourself
in
a
former
speculation
found
fault
with
very
justly
because
it
breaks
the
tide
of
the
passions
while
they
are
yet
flowing
but
this
is
nothing
at
all
to
the
present
case
where
they
have
already
had
their
full
course
as
the
new
epilogue
is
written
conformably
to
the
practice
of
our
best
poets
so
it
is
not
such
an
one
which
as
the
duke
of
buckingham
says
in
his
might
serve
for
any
other
play
but
wholly
rises
out
of
the
occurrences
of
the
piece
it
was
composed
for
the
only
reason
your
mournful
correspondent
gives
against
this
facetious
epilogue
as
he
calls
it
is
that
he
has
a
mind
to
go
home
melancholy
i
wish
the
gentleman
may
not
be
more
grave
than
wise
for
my
own
part
i
must
confess
i
think
it
very
sufficient
to
have
the
anguish
of
a
fictitious
piece
remain
upon
me
while
it
is
representing
but
i
love
to
be
sent
home
to
bed
in
a
good
humour
if
physibulus
is
however
resolved
to
be
inconsolable
and
not
to
have
his
tears
dried
up
he
need
only
continue
his
old
custom
and
when
he
has
had
his
worth
of
sorrow
slink
out
before
the
epilogue
begins
it
is
pleasant
enough
to
hear
this
tragical
genius
complaining
of
the
great
mischief
andromache
had
done
him
what
was
that
why
she
made
him
laugh
the
poor
gentleman
sufferings
put
me
in
mind
of
harlequin
case
who
was
tickled
to
death
he
tells
us
soon
after
through
a
small
mistake
of
sorrow
for
rage
that
during
the
whole
action
he
was
so
very
sorry
that
he
thinks
he
could
have
attacked
half
a
score
of
the
fiercest
mohawks
in
the
excess
of
his
grief
i
can
not
but
look
upon
it
as
a
happy
accident
that
a
man
who
is
so
in
his
affliction
was
diverted
from
this
fit
of
outrageous
melancholy
the
valour
of
this
gentleman
in
his
distress
brings
to
one
memory
the
knight
of
the
sorrowful
countenance
who
lays
about
him
at
such
an
unmerciful
rate
in
an
old
romance
i
shall
readily
grant
him
that
his
soul
as
he
himself
says
would
have
made
a
very
ridiculous
figure
had
it
quitted
the
body
and
descended
to
the
poetical
shades
in
such
an
encounter
as
to
his
conceit
of
tacking
a
tragic
head
with
a
comic
tail
in
order
to
refresh
the
audience
it
is
such
a
piece
of
jargon
that
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
elegant
writer
makes
a
very
sudden
transition
from
the
playhouse
to
the
church
and
from
thence
to
the
gallows
as
for
what
relates
to
the
church
he
is
of
opinion
that
these
epilogues
have
given
occasion
to
those
merry
jigs
from
the
which
have
dissipated
those
good
thoughts
and
dispositions
he
has
found
in
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
pew
upon
the
singing
of
two
staves
culled
out
by
the
judicious
and
diligent
clerk
he
fetches
his
next
thought
from
tyburn
and
seems
very
apprehensive
lest
there
should
happen

innovations
in

dennis
had
contrived
this
thunder
for
the
advantage
of
his
tragedy
of
appius
and
virginia
the
players
highly
approved
of
it
and
it
is
the
same
that
is
used
at
the
present
day
notwithstanding
the
effect
of
this

the

was
coldy
received

laid

some
nights
after

being
in

at

from

notes
on

do
not
indeed
wonder
that
the
actors
should
be
such
professed
enemies
to
those
among
our
nation
who
are
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
critics
since
it
is
a
rule
among
these
gentlemen
to
fall
upon
a
play
not
because
it
is
ill
written
but
because
it
takes
several
of
them
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
that
whatever
dramatic
performance
has
a
long
run
must
of
necessity
be
good
for
nothing
as
though
the
first
precept
in
poetry
were
not
to
please
whether
this
rule
holds
good
or
not
i
shall
leave
to
the
determination
of
those
who
are
better
judges
than
myself
if
it
does
i
am
sure
it
tends
very
much
to
the
honour
of
those
gentlemen
who
have
established
it
few
of
their
pieces
having
been
disgraced
by
a
run
of
three
days
and
most
of
them
being
so
exquisitely
written
that
the
town
would
never
give
them
more
than
one
night
hearing
i
have
great
esteem
for
a
true
critic
such
as
aristotle
and
longinus
among
the
greeks
horace
and
quintilian
among
the
romans
boileau
and
dacier
among
the
french
but
it
is
our
misfortune
that
some
who
set
up
for
professed
critics
among
us
are
so
stupid
that
they
do
not
know
how
to
put
ten
words
together
with
elegance
or
common
propriety
and
withal
so
illiterate
that
they
have
no
taste
of
the
learned
languages
and
therefore
criticise
upon
old
authors
only
at
second
hand
they
judge
of
them
by
what
others
have
written
and
not
by
any
notions
they
have
of
the
authors
themselves
the
words
unity
action
sentiment
and
diction
pronounced
with
an
air
of
authority
give
them
a
figure
among
unlearned
readers
who
are
apt
to
believe
they
are
very
deep
because
they
are
unintelligible
the
ancient
critics
are
full
of
the
praises
of
their
contemporaries
they
discover
beauties
which
escaped
the
observation
of
the
vulgar
and
very
often
find
out
reasons
for
palliating
and
excusing
such
little
slips
and
oversights
as
were
committed
in
the
writings
of
eminent
authors
on
the
contrary
most
of
the
smatterers
in
criticism
who
appear
among
us
make
it
their
business
to
vilify
and
depreciate
every
new
production
that
gains
applause
to
descry
imaginary
blemishes
and
to
prove
by
farfetched
arguments
that
what
pass
for
beauties
in
any
celebrated
piece
are
faults
and
errors
in
short
the
writings
of
these
critics
compared
with
those
of
the
ancients
are
like
the
works
of
the
sophists
compared
with
those
of
the
old
philosophers
envy
and
cavil
are
the
natural
fruits
of
laziness
and
ignorance
which
was
probably
the
reason
that
in
the
heathen
mythology
momus
is
said
to
be
the
son
of
nox
and
somnus
of
darkness
and
sleep
idle
men
who
have
not
been
at
the
pains
to
accomplish
or
distinguish
themselves
are
very
apt
to
detract
from
others
as
ignorant
men
are
very
subject
to
decry
those
beauties
in
a
celebrated
work
which
they
have
not
eyes
to
discover
many
of
our
sons
of
momus
who
dignify
themselves
by
the
name
of
critics
are
the
genuine
descendants
of
these
two
illustrious
ancestors
they
are
often
led
into
these
numerous
absurdities
in
which
they
daily
instruct
the
people
by
not
considering
that
first
there
is
sometimes
a
greater
judgment
shown
in
deviating
from
the
rules
of
art
than
in
adhering
to
them
and
secondly
that
there
is
more
beauty
in
the
works
of
a
great
genius
who
is
ignorant
of
all
the
rules
of
art
than
in
the
works
of
a
little
genius
who
not
only
knows
but
scrupulously
observes
them
first
we
may
often
take
notice
of
men
who
are
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
the
rules
of
good
writing
and
notwithstanding
choose
to
depart
from
them
on
extraordinary
occasions
i
could
give
instances
out
of
all
the
tragic
writers
of
antiquity
who
have
shown
their
judgment
in
this
particular
and
purposely
receded
from
an
established
rule
of
the
drama
when
it
has
made
way
for
a
much
higher
beauty
than
the
observation
of
such
a
rule
would
have
been
those
who
have
surveyed
the
noblest
pieces
of
architecture
and
statuary
both
ancient
and
modern
know
very
well
that
there
are
frequent
deviations
from
art
in
the
works
of
the
greatest
masters
which
have
produced
a
much
nobler
effect
than
a
more
accurate
and
exact
way
of
proceeding
could
have
done
this
often
arises
from
what
the
italians
call
the
in
these
arts
which
is
what
we
call
the
sublime
in
writing
in
the
next
place
our
critics
do
not
seem
sensible
that
there
is
more
beauty
in
the
works
of
a
great
genius
who
is
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
art
than
in
those
of
a
little
genius
who
knows
and
observes
them
it
is
of
those
men
of
genius
that
terrence
speaks
in
opposition
to
the
little
artificial
cavillers
of
his
time
quorum
aemulari

negligence

consolation

success
of

rule

actors
and
audience
cibber
among
our
many
necessary
reformations
what
not
a
little
preserved
to
us
the
regard
of
our
auditors
was
the
decency
of
our
clear
stage
from
whence
we
had
now
for
many
years
shut
out
those
idle
gentlemen
who
seemed
more
delighted
to
be
pretty
objects
themselves
than
capable
of
any
pleasure
from
the
play
who
took
their
daily
stands
where
they
might
best
elbow
the
actor
and
come
in
for
their
share
of
the
auditor
attention
in
many
a
laboured
scene
of
the
wannest
humour
and
of
the
most
affecting
passion
i
have
seen
the
best
actors
disconcerted
while
these
buzzing
muscatos
have
been
fluttering
round
their
eyes
and
ears
how
was
it
possible
an
actor
so
embarrassed
should
keep
his
impatience
from
entering
into
that
different
temper
which
his
personated
character
might
require
him
to
be
master
of
future
actors
may
perhaps
wish
i
would
set
this
grievance
in
a
stronger
light
and
to
say
the
truth
where
auditors
are
it
can
not
well
be
expected
that
actors
should
be
polite
let
me
therefore
show
how
far
an
artist
in
any
science
is
apt
to
be
hurt
by
any
sort
of
inattention
to
his
performance
while
the
famous
corelli
a
at
rome
was
playing
some
musical
composition
of
his
own
to
a
select
company
in
the
private
apartment
of
his
he
observed
in
the
heighth
of
his
harmony
his
eminence
was
engaging
in
a
detached
conversation
upon
which
he
suddenly
stopt
short
and
gently
laid
down
his
instrument
the
cardinal
surprised
at
the
unexpected
cessation
asked
him
if
a
string
was
broke
to
which
corelli
in
an
honest
conscience
of
what
was
due
to
his
musick
reply
no
sir
i
was
only
afraid
i
enterrupted
business
his
eminence
who
knew
that
a
genius
could
never
shew
itself
to
advantage
where
it
had
not
its
regards
took
this
reproof
in
good
part
and
broke
off
his
conversation
to
hear
the
whole
concerto
played
over
again

another
story
will
let
us
see
what
effect
a
mistaken
offence
of
this
kind
had
upon
the
french
theatre
which
was
told
me
by
a
gentleman
of
the
long
robe
then
at
paris
and
who
was
himself
the
innocent
author
of
it
at
the
tragedy
of
zaire
while
the
celebrated
mademoiselle
gossin
a
was
delivering
a
soliloquy
this
gentleman
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
coughing
which
gave
the
actress
some
surprise
and
interruption
and
his
fit
increasing
she
was
forced
to
stand
silent
so
long
that
it
drew
the
eyes
of
the
uneasy
audience
upon
him
when
a
french
gentleman
leaning
forward
to
him
asked
him
if
this
actress
had
given
him
any
particular
offence
that
he
took
so
publick
an
occasion
to
resent
it
the
english
gentleman
in
the
utmost
surprise
assured
him
so
far
from
it
that
he
was
a
particular
admirer
of
her
performance
that
his
malady
was
his
real
misfortune
and
if
he
apprehended
any
return
of
it
he
would
rather
quit
his
seat
than
disoblige
either
the
actress
or
the
audience

this
publick
decency
in
their
theatre
i
have
myself
seen
carried
so
far
that
a
gentleman
in
their
second
loge
or
being
observed
to
sit
forward
himself
while
a
lady
sate
behind
him
a
loud
number
of
voices
called
out

him

pit

when
the
person
so
offending
either
not
apprehending
the
meaning
of
the
clamour
or
possibly
being
some
john
trott
who
feared
no
man
alive
the
noise
was
continued
for
several
minutes
nor
were
the
actors
though
ready
on
the
stage
suffered
to
begin
the
play
till
this
unbred
person
was
laughed
out
of
his
seat
and
had
placed
the
lady
before
him
whether
this
politeness
observed
at
plays
may
be
owing
to
their
clime
their
complexion
or
their
government
is
of
no
great
consequence
but
if
it
is
to
be
acquired
methinks
it
is
a
pity
our
