so
many
excellent
books
have
been
written
about
that
it
is
perhaps
presumptuous
on
my
part
to
think
that
there
is
room
for
another
vivien
caulfeild
in
his
how
to
ski
and
turns
as
well
as
arnold
lunn
in
his
for
beginners
cross
country
and
alpine
have
covered
all
the
ground
of
the
technique
discovered
up
to
date
what
future
discoveries
and
inventions
may
be
made
requiring
new
books
no
one
knows
as
yet
had
it
not
been
for
the
help
and
coaching
these
two
exponents
of
have
given
to
me
personally
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
enjoy
the
sport
to
the
extent
i
do
now
because
i
should
probably
have
been
content
to
continue
running
across
country
falling
whenever
i
wanted
to
stop
and
using
a
kick
turn
at
the
end
of
my
traverses
their
enthusiasm
and
example
gave
me
new
ideas
of
the
standard
i
wanted
to
attain
and
their
unfailing
kindness
and
advice
helped
me
to
get
nearer
to
it
than
i
could
otherwise
have
done
the
standard
still
lies
away
up
out
of
reach
as
age
undoubtedly
tells
against
the
and
the
perfect
christiania
in
deep
soft
snow
round
trees
growing
close
together
on
a
steep
slope
must
be
done
in
heaven
rather
than
on
earth
by
people
who
are
nearer
fifty
than
forty
much
experience
of
coaching
beginners
convinces
me
that
there
is
still
room
for
a
book
such
as
i
hope
to
make
this
a
book
containing
only
the
simple
answers
to
questions
put
to
me
during
the
last
three
years
when
i
have
been
responsible
for
running
the
in
various
centres
the
object
of
such
coaching
is
to
raise
the
standard
of
british
and
it
is
satisfactory
to
realize
that
other
nations
including
the
swiss
already
marvel
at
the
fair
average
of
our
runners
this
is
specially
remarkable
when
it
is
remembered
that
most
british
runners
can
only
afford
a
bare
fortnight
or
three
winter
holiday
in
the
alps
and
that
they
are
not
always
in
training
when
they
arrive
is
a
sport
which
exercises
every
nerve
and
muscle
as
well
as
lungs
as
is
soon
discovered
during
the
first
feet
climb
or
the
first
fall
in
deep
snow
on
the
nursery
slopes
in
addition
to
my
conviction
that
there
is
room
for
another
book
for
beginners
my
love
of
the
alps
which
have
been
my
home
for
the
greater
part
of
my
life
also
induces
me
to
try
to
show
something
of
the
real
objects
of
namely
getting
to
the
silent
places
which
can
only
be
reached
on
skis
realizing
something
of
the
strength
and
immensity
of
nature
at
her
grimmest
profiting
by
the
wonderful
atmosphere
of
the
mountains
to
say
nothing
of
the
beauty
of
an
alpine
view
on
a
fine
day
the
greatest
pity
is
that
most
british
winter
can
only
go
out
for
christmas
this
is
admittedly
the
worst
time
from
the
point
of
view
of
weather
at
low
altitudes
rain
often
falls
early
in
january
turning
the
snow
into
slush
and
reducing
the
to
despair
after
the
january
the
weather
is
usually
better
and
in
february
the
days
are
longer
and
finer
the
best
time
of
all
for
an
alpine
holiday
is
usually
february
and
early
march
my
advice
to
novices
who
are
not
tied
by
christmas
holidays
is
to
come
out
about
the
january
when
the
hotels
are
less
crowded
the
days
longer
the
snow
more
certain
and
all
the
conditions
more
favourable
some
of
my
own
best
days
have
been
late
in
march
when
the
crocuses
and
gentians
were
already
opening
to
the
sun
on
the
southern
slopes
and
a
soldanella
might
be
found
along
some
tiny
stream
few
experiences
can
equal
a
spring
day
among
the
alps
when
the
wealth
of
flowers
begins
to
show
in
the
valleys
while
masses
of
good
snow
still
lie
on
the
northern
slopes
or
on
the
ridges
above
feet
early
starts
are
necessary
these
days
as
the
sun
blazes
after
but
nothing
can
equal
the
bodily
comfort
and
enjoyed
at
midday
lunching
at
the
top
of
some
peak
or
pass
basking
in
the
blaze
and
imagining
the
run
down
cool
slopes
no
who
has
not
been
out
in
late
february
or
march
realizes
the
joy
and
comfort
of
late
the
hotels
will
remain
open
as
long
as
clients
stay
to
make
it
worth
while
and
all
the
amenities
will
be
kept
up
if
they
are
wanted
in
recommending
places
and
equipment
i
intend
boldly
to
confine
myself
to
the
places
i
have
been
to
and
to
the
equipment
i
have
used
or
of
which
i
have
had
reports
from
people
i
trust
this
is
a
somewhat
risky
determination
as
there
is
great
competition
among
the
various
centres
and
business
firms
which
cater
for
my
reason
is
that
the
endless
advertisements
must
be
extremely
confusing
to
the
novice
who
does
not
know
what
to
believe
and
who
may
sometimes
be
let
down
by
a
glowing
description
of
some
place
or
gear
which
proves
to
be
quite
unsuitable
the
old
hands
will
find
nothing
new
in
this
book
not
even
controversy
about
the
nomenclature
of
turns
or
as
to
which
foot
should
carry
the
weight
in
a
christiania
my
own
view
of
turns
is
that
they
are
a
means
to
an
end
and
not
an
end
in
themselves
and
that
the
who
is
content
to
spend
weeks
on
the
nursery
slopes
perfecting
one
turn
has
wasted
almost
weeks
when
he
might
be
enjoying
what
skis
enable
one
to
reach
among
the
mountains
above
at
the
same
time
every
beginner
should
be
content
to
devote
two
or
three
of
his
first
days
to
the
nursery
slopes
learning
the
elements
of
good
before
dashing
off
on
an
excursion
as
i
know
from
painful
experience
there
is
much
to
unlearn
in
what
one
has
picked
up
by
the
light
of
nature
scrambling
down
a
run
crashing
and
sitting
on
skis
may
be
great
fun
the
first
day
but
is
tiring
and
humiliating
as
time
goes
on
it
is
infinitely
preferable
to
learn
the
knack
of
tidily
and
thereby
keeping
dry
and
in
a
few
days
running
well
enough
thoroughly
to
enjoy
a
day
out
with
its
slow
climb
to
the
top
of
some
peak
or
pass
and
then
the
slide
down
under
control
this
is
where
tests
are
so
valuable
most
people
undoubtedly
enjoy
competition
and
if
the
passing
of
the
turns
is
made
a
necessary
qualification
for
the
timed
run
of
the
class
test
most
beginners
will
determine
to
learn
them
and
then
to
try
the
run
and
having
successfully
passed
that
wear
a
badge
like
may
not
be
a
very
worthy
object
in
itself
but
if
it
encourages
people
to
become
proficient
in
a
beautiful
sport
let
us
give
our
weakness
of
character
free
play
and
achieve
the
results
it
leads
to
the
tests
of
the
federated
ski
clubs
of
great
britain
have
done
more
to
raise
the
standard
of
our
running
than
anything
else
imaginable
the
beginner
is
wise
who
chooses
a
centre
where
the
is
well
organized
and
where
he
can
be
certain
of
getting
coaching
as
well
as
excursions
suited
to
his
standard
as
nothing
is
lonelier
than
going
to
a
place
where
he
is
dependent
on
his
own
initiative
neither
is
anything
more
irksome
to
the
good
runner
than
to
be
asked
to
admit
a
stranger
to
his
party
who
may
keep
him
back
and
spoil
his
run
this
will
be
further
alluded
to
in
the
chapter
on
etiquette
and
if
a
beginner
wishes
to
be
popular
i
advise
him
strongly
to
adhere
to
the
law
a
strict
code
has
been
adopted
mainly
as
a
result
of
the
suffering
from
pertinacious
runners
who
put
their
standard
higher
than
is
admitted
by
others
where
the
is
organized
tests
sort
different
individuals
into
their
different
standards
and
runs
are
planned
accordingly
so
that
the
novice
is
not
and
the
experienced
runner
is
not
hindered
by
too
big
a
party
the
beginner
should
also
choose
a
centre
where
there
is
a
railway
to
help
him
a
great
deal
of
precious
time
and
energy
may
be
wasted
in
a
short
holiday
when
all
climbing
has
to
be
done
on
skis
the
first
runs
are
tiring
enough
without
the
additional
fatigue
of
climbing
and
going
up
in
a
funicular
or
railway
opens
up
numbers
of
runs
which
would
be
far
too

history
of
very
little
is
known
of
the
early
history
of
doctor
henry
hoek
in
his
book
der
schi
gives
a
very
interesting
chapter
tracing
the
use
of
skis
back
to
the
earliest
records
he
thinks
that
skis
were
used
by
central
asian
races
thousands
of
years
and
long
before
they
were
used
in
europe
according
to
his
book
the
word
schi
is
derived
from
the
gothic
skaidan
the
german
scheiden
latin
scindere
and
so
on
all
these
words
mean
split
or
divide
and
might
be
used
to
describe
the
split
wood
of
which
skis
are
made
or
their
action
in
dividing
or
separating
the
snow
through
which
they
pass
doctor
hoek
further
says
that
early
records
show
how
was
a
sport
practised
by
knights
and
he
quotes
rognwald
of
orkney
who
states
that
he
could
run
on
skis
the
swedish
bishop
magnus
writes
in
of
the
way
in
which
the
norwegians
used
skis
for
traversing
country
when
hunting
during
the
swedish
and
norwegian
war
in
the
norwegian
army
included
ski
runners
but
the
use
of
skis
does
not
seem
to
have
come
into
warfare
again
until
the
great
war
of
when
the
swiss
austrians
and
italians
all
used
them
on
the
alpine
frontiers
the
modern
and
fully
recorded
use
of
skis
began
about
when
the
sport
became
really
popular
in
norway
and
a
ski
race
was
run
at
tromso
in
a
ski
club
was
founded
and
in
an
exhibition
was
held
there
the
swedes
also
took
up
as
a
sport
at
about
this
time
but
skis
do
not
seem
to
have
penetrated
into
central
europe
until
after
when
a
french
doctor
tried
them
at
chamounix
in
the
first
introduction
of
skis
into
switzerland
which
i
have
been
able
to
trace
was
by
the
monks
of
bernard
who
obtained
some
pairs
from
norway
in
thinking
that
they
might
be
useful
in
their
work
of
mercy
rescuing
pedestrians
who
were
in
difficulties
on
the
pass
about
colonel
napier
came
to
davos
bringing
with
him
a
norwegian
and
a
pair
of
skis
mythical
tales
were
told
of
the
way
this
man
slid
down
the
slopes
from
châlet
to
hotel
carrying
a
tea
tray
on
his
shoulder
i
have
only
a
vague
recollection
of
seeing
him
perform
but
when
colonel
napier
left
davos
the
same
year
he
gave
the
skis
to
me
to
play
with
they
were
very
similar
to
modern
skis
but
had
a
rigid
binding
made
of
sealskin
with
no
means
of
tightening
or
loosening
it
not
knowing
better
i
used
to
try
to
run
in
gouties
or
rubber
which
slipped
about
inside
the
binding
so
that
i
had
absolutely
no
control
this
did
not
make
much
difference
as
i
knew
nothing
of
the
art
and
only
used
the
skis
as
a
freak
on
days
off
from
tobogganing
i
knew
nothing
of
wax
and
when
the
skis
stuck
they
stuck
and
i
thought
it
a
poor
game
when
they
slid
i
sat
down
and
i
thought
it
a
poorer
game
it
never
entered
my
head
that
i
could
traverse
across
any
slope
and
so
i
always
went
straight
down
and
only
by
a
fluke
did
i
ever
stand
then
tobias
branger
who
was
a
great
sportsman
and
kept
a
sports
shop
at
davos
imported
several
pairs
of
skis
and
practised
the
art
himself
about
this
time
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
and
and
hugh
dobson
took
up
the
game
and
we
spent
many
hours
practising
on
the
slopes
behind
davos
dorf
the
richardson
brothers
who
had
been
to
norway
came
to
davos
about
bringing
with
them
knowledge
of
the
sport
and
soon
gathered
round
them
a
keen
lot
of
disciples
the
davos
english
ski
club
was
formed
and
from
now
on
spread
rapidly
throughout
switzerland
in
the
meantime
ski
clubs
were
also
being
formed
in
the
black
forest
and
other
parts
of
germany
as
well
as
in
austria
doctor
nansen
in
his
book
about
greenland
described
the
use
of
skis
for
arctic
exploration
and
his
accounts
fired
a
great
many
more
people
to
try
the
game
i
advise
anyone
who
wishes
to
know
more
of
the
development
of
ski
running
to
read
doctor
hoek
book
der
schi
published
in
as
he
gives
a
long
account
of
the
first
forming
of
clubs
as
well
as
the
gradual
adoption
of
skis
as
a
means
to
winter
climbing
and
further
a
useful
list
of
the
literature
on
the
subject
after
the
first
beginnings
in
the
swiss
became
energetic
and
enthusiastic
runners
the
children
could
be
seen
on
barrel
staves
with
a
pair
of
old
boots
nailed
to
the
centre
into
which
they
slipped
their
feet
with
their
own
boots
on
it
was
not
a
particularly
graceful
game
in
those
days
runners
armed
themselves
with
poles
some
feet
long
on
which
they
leant
heavily
when
running
downhill
this
school
soon
gave
way
to
the
more
modern
school
which
proved
that
the
carrying
of
two
sticks
was
better
than
one
only
a
great
many
books
on
the
technique
of
followed
each
other
fast
and
furiously
zdarsky
and
lilienfeld
caulfeild
and
lunn
roget
hoeg
and
others
all
contributing
to
the
controversy
on
technique
now
there
are
innumerable
ski
clubs
with
their
own
and
the
sport
is
so
well
launched
not
only
in
europe
but
also
in
australia
new
zealand
east
africa
and
america
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
world
that
there
is
but
little
chance
of
its
ever
again
dying
out
the
british
ski
clubs
include
the
ski
club
of
great
britain
the
british
ski
association
the
alpine
ski
club
and
the
ladies
ski
club
these
are
federated
in
one
council
and
work
harmoniously
together
for
the
furtherance
of
british
this
is
a
very
incomplete
history
but
i
feel
that
it
is
better
to
limit
it
to
a
few
dates
and
to
await
the
publishing
of
a
more
extensive
history
of
in
english
than
now
exists
cost
of
a
holiday
in
winter
the
expenses
of
a
winter
holiday
differ
according
to
the
place
chosen
the
hotel
and
the
organization
to
whose
care
you
commit
yourself
if
any
any
figures
i
quote
are
approximate
and
are
subject
to
change
owing
to
fluctuations
in
exchanges
etc
if
you
go
to
a
large
hotel
with
all
its
luxuries
you
will
pay
anything
from
a
day
upwards
and
this
may
not
include
sports
tax
etc
the
smaller
hotels
will
probably
make
arrangements
for
pension
at
about
francs
or
even
francs
or
less
per
day
but
may
not
be
very
comfortable
and
comfort
is
important
in
winter
it
is
particularly
necessary
that
the
hotel
should
be
well
heated
as
the
drying
of
clothes
is
a
very
important
point
as
i
said
in
my
preface
the
beginner
will
be
wise
who
chooses
a
centre
where
the
sports
are
highly
organized
and
where
he
will
be
certain
to
find
coaching
and
arrangements
made
for
tests
and
runs
as
well
as
a
railway
or
funicular
to
help
with
uphill
work
only
in
such
a
place
can
he
learn
enough
in
a
short
time
to
enable
him
to
begin
to
enjoy
touring
before
he
returns
home
panting
to
come
out
again
and
continue
the
experience
one
joy
of
is
that
you
usually
begin
again
where
you
left
off
and
have
not
to
relearn
what
you
learnt
the
winter
before
having
lived
in
the
alps
off
and
on
for
years
and
having
seen
all
sorts
of
different
ways
of
running
things
i
realized
at
mürren
where
i
first
learnt
to
ski
properly
four
years
ago
how
much
the
beginner
profits
by
going
to
such
a
centre
otherwise
he
may
waste
infinite
time
in
without
skill
and
with
only
half
the
enjoyment
it
is
not
only
at
mürren
that
the
coaching
is
given
though
arnold
lunn
system
of
helping
everyone
originated
there
pontresina
provides
it
also
and
klosters
and
other
places
as
well
but
it
seems
to
me
that
mürren
is
the
mother
of
british
the
cost
of
a
fortnight
at
a
good
hotel
comes
to
about
including
sports
tax
afternoon
tea
and
heating
the
journey
about
return
or
in
addition
this
can
be
reduced
by
travelling
class
in
england
and
switzerland
where
at
any
rate
it
is
quite
possible
to
travel
class
on
any
mountain
railway
in
addition
to
the
expense
of
pension
at
an
hotel
and
of
the
journey
at
least
will
probably
be
required
for
local
railway
fares
subscription
to
entertainment
fund
baths
gratuities
hire
of
skis
lessons
guides
etc
ought
to
cover
a
fortnight
and
three
weeks
and
a
good
deal
less
can
be
reckoned
if
a
smaller
hotel
be
chosen
most
of
the
sports
hotels
will
now
quote
an
inclusive
price
per
day
to
which
at
least
per
cent
should
be
added
to
the
estimate
for
gratuities
to
servants
this
is
the
recognized
scale
at
which
gratuities
are
given
by
most
people
though
they
might
often
amount
to
more
when
any
special
service
has
been
rendered
local
railway
fares
on
mountain
railways
are
high
because
of
the
great
expense
of
keeping
them
open
but
most
of
these
railways
offer
special
sports
tickets
either
for
a
definite
period
as
a
season
ticket
or
for
a
certain
number
of
journeys
for
instance
on
the
muottas
muraigl
funicular
railway
above
pontresina
tickets
single
journey
can
be
obtained
for
the
sum
of
frs
while
the
ordinary
single
fare
is
frs
or
more
than
twice
the
reduced
fare
the
cost
of
equipment
must
be
added
to
the
estimate
but
this
need
not
be
very
great
as
boots
and
gloves
are
the
only
items
which
can
not
usually
be
used
at
home
by
men
trousers
or
breeches
being
an
additional
cost
for
women
people
sometimes
complain
that
a
swiss
winter
holiday
is
very
costly
but
i
believe
it
can
compare
favourably
with
a
golfing
holiday
at
home
is
the
cheapest
possible
sport
if
runners
are
content
to
foot
it
uphill
instead
of
using
railways
or
sledges
during
the
months
of
february
and
march
special
low
terms
can
probably
be
obtained
in
the
hotels
as
they
are
anxious
to
prolong
their
season
and
will
do
anything
they
can
afford
to
induce
british
sportsmen
to
come
out
then
february
and
the
first
half
of
march
are
the
best
time
from
every
point
of
view
so
that
no
one
who
can
take
his
holiday
then
and
who
does
not
want
all
the
gaiety
of
the
social
side
will
regret
going
during
these
months
in
old
days
before
the
war
this
was
fully
appreciated
and
the
season
used
to
last
three
months
instead
of
a
short
six
weeks
as
it
does
now
centres
in
this
chapter
i
propose
only
to
describe
such
of
the
larger
swiss
places
as
i
know
personally
or
by
reputation
there
are
a
great
many
smaller
places
where
equally
good
or
even
better
may
be
found
but
as
my
book
is
meant
mainly
for
beginners
it
seems
preferable
to
adhere
to
the
advice
given
in
the
preface
and
for
me
to
mention
only
such
centres
as
provide
comfort
in
the
hotels
and
good
coaching
and
organization
of
tours
as
well
as
facilities
for
playing
other
games
most
people
when
they
go
to
the
alps
for
their
first
winter
visit
wish
to
try
all
the
different
sports
in
order
to
see
which
they
like
best
and
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
question
but
that
the
sportsman
gets
the
most
out
of
his
holiday
there
may
be
days
when
is
not
possible
or
when
a
few
hours
on
the
rink
or
toboggan
run
offer
a
relief
to
a
stale
ski
runner
it
is
usually
only
the
really
keen
enthusiast
of
some
years
standing
who
can
spend
the
whole
day
waxing
or
oiling
his
skis
or
poring
over
a
map
planning
future
runs
when
choosing
a
place
the
first
objective
is
a
good
supply
of
snow
this
does
not
seem
to
depend
entirely
on
height
though
there
is
more
likelihood
of
finding
it
above
feet
than
below
that
height
above
feet
there
is
less
chance
of
thaw
and
rain
the
bugbears
of
all
winter
sportsmen
who
can
only
go
out
for
the
christmas
holidays
i
have
known
a
winter
when
snow
has
lain
in
one
district
at
feet
and
not
at
feet
in
another
but
this
was
exceptional
the
higher
you
go
the
more
hope
you
have
of
snow
as
a
rule
and
also
of
frost
which
is
so
necessary
to
keep
the
snow
in
good
condition
the
centres
i
recommend
are
mainly
arranged
in
groups
geographically
taking
the
canton
of
graubunden
or
the
grisons
first
because
it
is
the
country
i
love
best
having
spent
most
of
my
early
life
there
the
heights
are
taken
from
murray
handbook
klosters
feet
above
the
sea
this
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
winter
sports
centres
it
is
a
small
village
with
two
large
and
a
few
small
hotels
it
usually
has
good
snow
and
is
protected
from
wind
there
is
plenty
of
sun
but
north
slopes
provide
good
runs
near
the
village
as
well
as
on
the
parsenn
the
rhaetische
railway
helps
runners
to
get
the
maximum
of
downhill
running
for
the
minimum
of
climb
especially
opening
up
the
whole
parsenn
district
to
those
who
want
a
long
day
tour
with
only
some
hours
climb
the
nursery
slopes
are
good
and
there
is
plenty
of
open
ground
near
the
hotels
for
practice
the
is
well
organized
by
the
local
club
and
there
are
ski
instructors
as
well
as
certificated
guides
the
rinks
are
well
kept
and
the
klosters
run
of
old
renown
is
maintained
in
good
condition
for
tobogganing
or
bobbing
there
is
quite
a
good
ski
map
to
be
obtained
locally
but
the
ordnance
map
should
be
used
as
well
skis
can
be
hired
locally
davos
feet
above
the
sea
was
one
of
the
first
places
at
which
winter
sports
began
and
it
still
offers
almost
everything
desired
by
the
ski
runner
the
fact
that
davos
is
much
visited
by
invalids
deters
a
great
many
people
from
going
there
for
fear
of
infection
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
probably
a
good
deal
safer
there
than
in
some
other
places
where
there
may
be
a
few
invalids
but
where
the
same
precautions
regarding
disinfection
may
not
be
taken
two
or
three
hotels
are
kept
open
for
sports
people
only
and
at
these
the
life
is
just
the
same
as
in
all
the
other
centres
davos
is
within
very
easy
reach
by
the
rhaetische
railway
of
all
the
parsenn
runs
the
side
valleys
fluela
dischma
and
sertig
all
offer
innumerable
good
runs
to
the
energetic
runner
who
does
not
object
to
climbing
and
there
are
endless
nursery
slopes
it
is
one
of
the
few
places
whence
tours
can
still
be
planned
over
almost
unlimited
when
a
track
is
a
rare
sight
except
on
the
few
ordinary
short
runs
or
on
the
parsenn
the
local
club
organizes
the
and
good
ski
instructors
and
guides
are
available
the
rinks
are
excellent
and
the
schatzalp
and
klosters
runs
are
maintained
for
bobbing
and
tobogganing
there
is
a
good
ski
map
showing
all
the
runs
round
davos
but
the
ordnance
map
should
be
used
as
well
skis
can
be
hired
locally
arosa
feet
above
the
sea
is
said
to
be
excellent
for
but
i
do
not
know
it
well
there
is
no
railway
to
help
runners
much
invalids
go
there
as
well
as
to
davos
but
the
same
precautions
are
taken
as
at
davos
there
are
rinks
and
a
very
good
run
for
bobbing
and
tobogganing
lenzerheide
about
feet
above
the
sea
has
a
fine
reputation
for
easy
there
is
no
railway
to
help
it
and
all
uphill
work
has
to
be
done
on
skis
i
have
never
been
there
in
but
know
that
a
great
many
runners
speak
well
of
lenzerheide
the
is
organized
and
good
instructors
and
guides
are
available
there
is
probably
a
good
rink
but
of
this
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
in
the
engadine
valley
which
is
also
part
of
graubunden
the
following
centres
can
be
recommended
pontresina
feet
above
the
sea
the
nursery
slopes
are
very
extensive
and
offer
short
runs
to
the
beginner
the
muottas
muraigl
funicular
conveys
runners
up
some
feet
when
after
an
easy
climb
of
one
hour
a
really
good
run
may
be
obtained
back
to
pontresina
the
rhaetische
and
bernina
railways
open
up
a
large
number
of
good
runs
in
the
engadine
valley
and
also
up
the
bernina
and
morteratsch
districts
open
as
well
as
under
safe
conditions
can
be
enjoyed
near
home
and
pontresina
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
places
for
people
who
want
to
perfect
their
running
under
different
conditions
there
are
no
short
afternoon
runs
ending
in
the
village
but
the
railways
enable
people
to
enjoy
all
the
tours
of
the
upper
engadine
the
longer
tours
such
as
those
over
the
kesch
glacier
to
bergün
or
davos
are
unequalled
so
far
as
i
know
having
spent
two
winters
at
pontresina
i
can
recommend
it
from
intimate
knowledge
but
only
for
the
real
beginner
or
for
the
expert
who
wants
amusing
running
it
is
not
the
place
for
who
only
want
a
short
run
between
lunch
and
tea
guides
and
good
instructors
are
available
the
is
organized
and
plenty
of
coaching
is
given
to
members
of
the
public
schools
alpine
sports
club
excellent
rinks
and
short
bobbing
and
tobogganing
runs
are
maintained
a
useful
guide
describing
all
the
runs
in
the
upper
engadine
can
be
obtained
locally
skis
can
be
hired
locally
moritz
feet
above
the
sea
celerina
samaden
are
all
served
by
the
rhaetische
and
bernina
railway
and
have
the
same
facilities
as
pontresina
their
rinks
and
toboggan
runs
are
well
maintained
those
at
moritz
being
of
course
among
the
best
in
switzerland
good
guides
and
ski
instructors
are
available
but
so
far
as
i
know
is
not
in
any
way
organized
for
beginners
in
these
places
skis
can
be
hired
locally
zuoz
feet
above
the
sea
is
also
a
good
centre
further
down
the
inn
valley
there
are
only
two
or
three
hotels
and
the
village
is
quite
unspoilt
it
provides
the
most
wonderful
open
south
slopes
for
and
north
slopes
are
also
within
reach
across
the
valley
zuoz
lies
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
climb
for
the
kesch
runs
and
also
taps
the
country
further
down
the
inn
valley
behind
schuls
so
far
as
i
know
the
is
not
organized
in
any
way
but
guides
are
available
there
are
rinks
but
zuoz
being
still
one
of
the
places
life
would
be
quiet
there
campfer
about
feet
above
the
sea
and
and
silvaplana
about
feet
above
the
sea
lie
further
up
the
inn
valley
beyond
moritz
no
railway
exists
to
help
ski
runners
and
the
slopes
are
somewhat
steep
and
apt
to
be
precipitous
except
in
the
fex
thal
south
of
which
has
lovely
campfer
and
silvaplana
tap
the
country
lying
behind
the
julier
pass
but
as
no
railway
helps
here
the
tours
entail
a
lot
of
climbing
and
a
drive
on
the
way
home
maloja
feet
above
the
sea
lies
at
the
upper
end
of
the
inn
valley
never
having
been
there
in
winter
i
can
not
describe
it
during
that
season
it
is
a
beautiful
place
in
summer
and
may
open
up
a
good
deal
of
country
which
is
not
much
tracked
as
there
is
no
village
and
only
one
large
and
two
small
hotels
the
post
road
runs
zigzagging
down
into
italy
and
is
said
to
provide
a
very
fine
bob
or
toboggan
run
a
rink
is
kept
open
now
that
maloja
is
being
opened
as
a
winter
centre
every
amenity
for
a
winter
holiday
will
probably
be
offered
the
bernese
oberland
is
also
one
of
the
best
districts
in
switzerland
lunn
has
produced
a
very
helpful
guide
to
all
the
tours
and
also
with
the
help
of
herr
gurtner
a
map
using
the
ordnance
map
as
its
basis
so
that
only
one
map
need
be
carried
mürren
feet
above
the
sea
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
centres
for
beginners
as
they
receive
so
much
help
and
there
are
numbers
of
short
runs
aided
by
the
allmendhubel
funicular
which
runs
up
some
feet
above
the
village
from
the
top
of
this
several
short
runs
end
in
the
village
or
on
the
berner
oberland
railway
which
brings
the
tired
novice
home
without
much
effort
the
berner
oberland
and
the
wengern
alp
railways
also
enable
people
to
get
the
best
of
the
scheidegg
runs
down
to
wengen
or
grindelwald
the
is
very
highly
organized
at
mürren
and
beginners
receive
a
great
deal
of
help
and
encouragement
there
are
guides
and
instructors
the
rinks
and
bob
run
are
admittedly
among
the
best
in
switzerland
skis
can
be
hired
locally
wengen
feet
above
the
sea
is
a
lovely
place
with
the
most
beautiful
view
of
the
jungfrau
it
faces
south
but
provides
two
or
three
nice
home
runs
which
remain
in
good
condition
except
for
the
tracks
of
innumerable
runners
the
wengern
alp
railway
is
usually
open
to
the
scheidegg
though
after
a
very
heavy
it
may
take
a
few
days
to
clear
this
enables
people
to
enjoy
all
the
runs
down
to
grindelwald
returning
to
wengen
by
train
the
is
organized
and
there
are
good
guides
and
instructors
rinks
and
a
most
amusing
toboggan
run
provide
for
skis
can
be
hired
locally
grindelwald
feet
above
the
sea
is
too
as
a
summer
resort
to
need
much
description
here
its
main
fault
in
winter
is
that
the
sun
disappears
behind
a
mountain
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
middle
of
the
day
this
ensures
perfect
ice
on
the
rinks
and
does
not
much
affect
the
ski
runner
who
can
climb
beyond
the
shadow
for
lunch
i
can
not
resist
mentioning
my
good
friend
frau
wolther
as
one
of
the
great
attractions
at
grindelwald
drawing
many
a
ski
runner
over
the
scheidegg
from
mürren
and
wengen
frau
wolther
unfailing
welcome
and
hospitality
are
a
great
joy
at
the
end
of
a
hot
wet
run
and
the
fact
that
a
change
of
clothes
can
be
sent
round
by
train
to
her
care
is
a
great
comfort
to
those
coming
from
afar
there
are
plenty
of
short
ski
runs
above
grindelwald
and
the
scheidegg
railway
is
kept
open
as
far
as
alpiglen
to
help
with
the
climb
on
a
long
day
tour
there
are
good
guides
to
be
had
some
of
whom
are
probably
ski
instructors
the
rinks
are
and
both
bob
and
toboggan
runs
are
kept
up
skis
can
be
hired
locally
lauterbrunnen
about
feet
above
the
sea
people
who
know
switzerland
well
may
wonder
why
i
include
lauterbrunnen
in
my
list
but
i
have
often
wondered
equally
why
no
one
makes
it
a
centre
for
though
the
sun
may
not
shine
there
for
long
hours
the
fact
that
it
lies
at
the
junction
of
the
berner
oberland
railway
the
mürren
funicular
and
the
wengern
alp
railway
seems
to
me
to
make
it
a
very
possible
centre
there
are
good
hotels
and
the
herr
gurtners
whose
home
lauterbrunnen
is
may
be
depended
upon
as
two
of
the
best
ski
runners
in
switzerland
and
two
of
the
most
active
pushers
of
to
do
their
utmost
to
help
any
british
runners
who
decide
to
try
lauterbrunnen
all
the
mürren
wengen
and
grindelwald
runs
are
within
easy
reach
of
lauterbrunnen
and
if
the
railways
will
sell
special
tickets
the
cost
of
the
journeys
should
not
be
prohibitive
to
my
mind
the
fact
that
one
could
stop
at
lauterbrunnen
after
a
day
over
the
scheidegg
would
be
a
great
comfort
as
the
last
journey
up
to
mürren
or
wengen
is
apt
to
be
tiresome
after
a
long
run
if
often
repeated
in
any
case
it
seems
to
me
that
runners
might
do
worse
than
write
to
herr
gurtner
at
lauterbrunnen
and
ask
for
particulars
at
any
rate
for
the
christmas
holidays
when
most
of
the
popular
villages
are
very
full
and
the
hotel
rates
are
high
good
guides
are
available
at
lauterbrunnen
kandersteg
feet
above
the
sea
i
have
never
been
there
except
in
summer
when
i
know
it
well
one
great
attraction
about
kandersteg
is
that
it
can
be
reached
by
a
through
train
from
calais
or
boulogne
from
the
point
of
view
i
think
kandersteg
might
be
disappointing
to
the
runner
who
hopes
for
short
runs
there
are
excellent
nursery
slopes
and
the
loetschberg
railway
probably
opens
up
quite
a
lot
of
country
guides
are
obtainable
rinks
and
toboggan
runs
are
maintained
adelboden
feet
above
the
sea
is
said
to
be
an
excellent
centre
but
i
do
not
know
it
personally
having
only
just
been
up
there
in
summer
time
there
is
no
railway
to
help
so
that
all
climbing
has
to
be
done
on
skis
it
is
within
reach
of
very
good
tours
throughout
the
lower
bernese
mountains
the
british
championship
was
held
there
in
which
shows
that
the
is
organized
and
good
guides
are
no
doubt
obtainable
adelboden
being
a
winter
sports
centre
the
rink
and
toboggan
runs
are
probably
excellent
but
never
having
seen
them
i
can
not
vouch
for
them
skis
can
be
hired
locally
saanenmoser
feet
above
the
sea
lies
at
the
top
of
the
low
pass
between
the
simmen
valley
above
zweizimme
and
the
sarine
valley
running
down
to
gstaad
and
chateau
there
is
only
the
one
sports
hotel
and
no
village
it
is
a
most
charming
place
within
reach
of
in
all
directions
among
the
lower
bernese
mountains
the
montreux
oberland
railway
running
down
both
sides
of
the
pass
helps
a
little
by
carrying
ski
runners
home
after
some
long
excursions
but
all
uphill
work
has
to
be
done
on
skis
the
slopes
are
gradual
and
the
saanenmoser
runs
are
perfect
for
people
who
have
learnt
the
elements
of
in
some
active
place
and
who
then
want
to
gain
confidence
by
free
running
over
easy
country
the
was
not
organized
when
i
was
at
saanenmoser
in
and
neither
guides
nor
ski
instructors
were
obtainable
there
was
only
a
tiny
rink
and
no
toboggan
or
bob
runs
skis
can
be
hired
at
gstaad
gstaad
about
feet
above
the
sea
lies
below
saanenmoser
and
is
a
large
village
with
numbers
of
hotels
the
is
very
much
the
same
as
at
saanenmoser
and
the
railway
serves
the
same
purpose
only
helping
runners
a
little
i
have
never
stayed
at
gstaad
but
have
heard
it
well
spoken
of
as
a
winter
sports
centre
offering
all
the
usual
attractions
skis
can
be
hired
locally
i
believe
and
guides
are
obtainable
the
rhone
valley
offers
a
few
centres
which
i
do
not
know
in
winter
among
those
i
have
heard
most
about
the
following
are
outstanding
villars
feet
above
the
sea
is
reached
by
a
railway
from
bex
it
lies
on
slopes
facing
south
and
i
gather
that
the
there
is
somewhat
limited
the
rinks
are
said
to
be
good
and
the
usual
winter
attractions
are
offered
montana
feet
above
the
sea
is
reached
by
a
funicular
railway
from
sierre
like
villars
it
also
lies
on
slopes
facing
almost
south
but
there
seems
to
be
good
among
the
mountains
behind
morgins
in
addition
to
the
above
i
would
mention
morgins
which
i
do
not
know
personally
but
of
which
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
morgins
is
feet
above
the
sea
and
is
particularly
for
its
rinks
which
seem
to
be
the
is
said
to
be
good
but
not
extensive
there
is
no
railway
diablerets
feet
above
the
sea
in
a
valley
going
from
aigle
among
the
mountains
to
the
east
might
be
a
good
centre
for
but
i
only
know
it
in
summer
so
far
as
i
have
heard
it
offers
the
usual
attractions
in
winter
but
there
is
no
railway
to
help
much
in
other
districts
of
switzerland
the
following
places
should
be
mentioned
although
i
have
never
been
to
them
in
winter
time
engelberg
feet
above
the
sea
in
the
stans
valley
near
luzern
is
often
well
spoken
of
as
a
winter
centre
though
it
is
liable
to
thaw
and
shortage
of
snow
from
what
i
know
of
it
in
summer
time
i
should
think
that
most
of
the
surrounding
slopes
are
too
steep
and
precipitous
to
allow
of
much
free
running
but
the
titlis
group
probably
provides
some
open
country
and
there
is
a
short
funicular
above
the
village
there
are
excellent
hotels
and
all
the
usual
attractions
are
offered
andermatt
feet
above
the
sea
lies
in
the
gothard
valley
above
the
tunnel
and
is
easily
reached
in
winter
by
express
trains
stopping
at
goeschinen
whence
a
short
mountain
railway
runs
up
to
andermatt
i
have
only
been
there
in
summer
and
from
what
i
saw
should
imagine
that
andermatt
was
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
wind
the
slopes
all
look
somewhat
steep
and
are
bare
of
forest
so
that
they
might
be
somewhat
dangerous
on
account
of
avalanches
there
is
no
railway
to
help
ski
runners
but
andermatt
might
offer
quite
a
lot
of
good
runs
to
experienced
people
i
know
nothing
of
the
other
attractions
for
the
winter
sportsman
but
have
little
doubt
that
andermatt
which
is
a
place
does
all
it
can
to
satisfy
them
there
are
of
course
innumerable
other
places
which
may
be
good
centres
not
only
in
switzerland
but
also
in
germany
austria
and
the
italian
tyrol
the
jura
mountains
and
places
such
as
splugen
and
schuls
in
graubunden
might
open
up
new
districts
there
is
much
new
country
to
explore
and
i
have
only
picked
out
for
notice
the
few
places
to
which
i
have
been
myself
or
of
which
i
have
heard
from
people
i
trust
my
description
may
not
always
be
appreciated
by
people
who
have
special
affection
for
any
one
centre
but
i
have
only
tried
to
put
forward
my
own
impressions
for
the
guidance
of
any
beginner
who
may
feel
in
a
quandary
as
to
what
place
to
choose
so
much
depends
on
weather
conditions
if
there
is
plenty
of
snow
and
if
the
sun
shines
almost
every
place
is
delightful
if
on
the
other
hand
a
thaw
settles
in
or
fog
descends
on
the
mountains
or
a
blizzard
blows
the
snow
about
or
worst
of
all
if
rain
falls
reducing
the
snow
to
slush
nobody
will
be
satisfied
anywhere
luckily
for
ski
runners
even
a
few
inches
of
wet
snow
will
provide
practice
so
that
they
suffer
less
than
other
winter
sportsmen
when
the
weather
is
unfavourable
one
thing
can
invariably
be
depended
upon
in
switzerland
namely
a
warm
welcome
from
the
hotels
and
every
endeavour
made
to
ensure
the
comfort
and
enjoyment
of
their
clients
no
country
in
the
world
lays
itself
out
more
for
the
satisfaction
of
its
visitors
and
no
holiday
can
beat
a
winter
holiday
among
the
alps
when
the
conditions
are
favourable
and
the
sportsmen
determined
to
enjoy
themselves
footnotes

there
is
apt
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
wind
in
the
whole
engadine
but
its
height
counterbalances
this
by
usually
ensuring
that
there
is
not
a
thaw
even
at
christmas
time
clothing
clothing
should
be
light
smooth
warm
loose
and
when
buttoned
up
it
should
leave
no
gaps
it
is
better
to
wear
several
thin
warm
garments
than
one
thick
one
for
the
simple
reason
that
going
uphill
one
wants
to
peel
to
the
minimum
sitting
on
top
of
a
mountain
or
ridge
in
a
wind
one
wants
to
pile
on
everything
one
possesses
and
going
downhill
one
wants
a
medium
amount
all
of
which
will
button
up
so
that
the
snow
can
not
penetrate
inside
ordinary
country
clothes
will
usually
suffice
for
the
first
season
especially
if
they
are
of
smooth
material
which
will
shake
off
the
snow
men
usually
wear
smooth
wool
or
cotton
gaberdene
coats
and
trousers
and
a
peaked
guide
cap
their
trousers
either
tuck
inside
the
uppers
of
their
boots
and
should
be
sufficiently
long
to
do
so
without
pulling
out
in
a
strained
turn
or
fall
or
they
may
be
buttoned
round
outside
the
boots
or
folded
and
tied
on
with
norwegian
puttees
or
swanks
breeches
and
stockings
may
be
worn
but
long
puttees
should
be
avoided
as
they
constrict
the
muscles
and
stop
the
circulation
thus
tending
to
which
is
a
serious
danger
at
high
altitudes
sweaters
unless
worn
under
a
coat
when
practising
or
running
downhill
are
quite
unsuitable
as
the
snow
gets
into
the
stitches
and
then
melts
and
the
sweater
becomes
a
sponge
and
often
stretches
till
it
is
more
like
a
woman
than
anything
it
was
before
a
suit
should
be
well
provided
with
pockets
all
of
which
should
have
flaps
to
button
over
and
keep
the
snow
out
also
to
keep
the
contents
in
money
and
other
things
carried
loose
are
apt
to
fall
out
in
a
downhill
fall
once
this
winter
when
getting
up
from
a
fall
i
saw
what
looked
like
a
useful
leather
lying
in
the
snow
i
picked
it
up
and
found
it
was
the
bootlace
attached
to
two
which
i
had
been
using
for
a
test
as
one
can
not
tie
one
money
up
with
a
it
is
wise
to
carry
it
safely
and
cheat
the
goatherds
who
may
surely
make
a
profitable
living
out
of
the
various
treasures
lost
by
which
appear
on
the
slopes
after
the
snow
melts
women
need
very
much
the
same
sort
of
clothing
as
men
either
trousers
or
breeches
whichever
they
prefer
these
should
be
made
to
measure
in
order
to
fit
well
and
be
worn
with
braces
to
pull
them
up
thick
stockings
should
be
worn
to
pull
up
over
the
breeches
if
women
would
only
realize
how
sloppy
their
nether
garments
sometimes
look
and
how
really
horrid
breeches
look
hanging
loose
over
silk
stockings
indoors
they
would
surely
be
more
careful
to
study
and
copy
a
man
neat
legs
before
they
venture
into
man
apparel
one
sometimes
sees
women
coats
made
with
innumerable
fancy
buttons
or
tabs
as
decoration
these
only
add
to
the
weight
which
no
one
would
want
to
carry
and
also
look
out
of
place
so
does
fur
trimming
clothes
can
not
be
too
simple
elaboration
is
easily
obtained
by
gloves
scarves
or
swanks
coats
should
be
made
with
a
belt
which
can
be
buckled
tight
before
the
descent
a
sitting
fall
in
soft
snow
is
apt
to
provide
the
runner
with
a
good
dose
of
snow
inside
the
coat
for
the
same
reason
breeches
and
trousers
should
be
cut
somewhat
high
above
the
waist
women
need
just
as
many
pockets
as
men
and
i
strongly
advise
two
large
side
pockets
and
two
smaller
breast
pockets
outside
the
coat
as
well
as
two
inside
breast
pockets
all
with
flaps
to
button
over
a
felt
hat
is
now
usually
worn
by
women
ski
runners
who
find
the
brim
a
comfort
on
sunny
days
while
it
also
protects
the
eyes
when
through
a
blizzard
incidentally
it
helps
to
prevent
snow
from
going
down
the
neck
in
a
fall
a
may
be
required
for
fast
running
boots
are
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
a
ski
runner
outfit
they
must
be
and
large
enough
to
hold
two
pairs
of
socks
in
addition
to
stockings
the
soles
must
be
so
stout
that
they
will
not
buckle
or
bend
under
the
instep
when
the
ski
binding
is
tight
heels
must
be
low
and
should
be
slightly
grooved
at
the
back
to
hold
the
binding
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
most
of
the
boots
sold
in
england
prove
to
be
unsatisfactory
such
firms
as
lillywhite
and
fortnum
mason
which
make
a
study
of
suitable
equipment
may
be
trusted
and
almost
every
swiss
bootmaker
now
sells
trustworthy
boots
for
i
always
buy
my
own
boots
from
och
who
has
shops
at
geneva
montreux
zürich
and
moritz
they
can
be
relied
on
for
at
least
two
or
three
long
seasons
if
one
is
careful
to
oil
the
uppers
with
boot
oil
occasionally
and
never
to
oil
the
soles
except
with
linseed
oil
which
is
said
to
harden
them
on
the
whole
however
the
soles
are
safest
left
untouched
boots
should
never
be
dried
on
a
radiator
or
by
a
fire
personally
i
like
hooks
rather
than
eyelets
and
i
find
that
leather
last
longer
than
others
there
is
much
discussion
as
to
whether
ski
boots
should
have
nails
in
the
soles
or
not
they
tend
to
wear
away
the
aluminium
or
linoleum
plates
fixed
to
the
skis
under
the
foot
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
almost
indispensable
when
skis
are
carried
across
a
hard
steep
slope
or
down
an
icy
path
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
positively
dangerous
to
go
any
real
ski
tour
with
unnailed
boots
unless
crampons
or
spikes
to
fit
on
to
the
heels
be
carried
new
plates
can
easily
be
fitted
to
the
skis
when
nails
have
worn
through
them
but
nothing
can
help
the
down
a
steep
icy
path
or
across
a
hard
frozen
slope
on
smooth
soles
unless
he
carries
special
contrivances
to
fix
to
his
boots
people
are
now
trying
crepe
rubber
soles
but
they
are
not
solid
enough
to
bear
the
strain
of
tight
bindings
unless
fixed
to
the
usual
thick
leather
sole
when
the
whole
becomes
too
thick
for
comfort
my
experience
for
several
winters
with
beginners
is
that
the
soles
of
most
english
boots
buckle
as
soon
as
they
are
subjected
to
the
tight
pull
of
a
leather
binding
few
things
are
more
irritating
to
a
beginner
than
to
find
that
his
binding
will
not
hold
on
his
boot
over
and
over
again
in
a
run
down
his
ski
comes
off
and
he
delays
his
party
by
having
to
stop
and
put
it
on
again
still
it
will
not
hold
even
though
he
ties
it
on
with
string
then
he
realizes
that
his
boot
is
buckling
the
sole
arches
up
under
the
instep
and
the
binding
becoming
loose
slips
off
the
heel
there
is
no
cure
for
this
and
the
only
solution
is
to
use
a
toe
binding
such
as
the
new
or
a
solid
binding
such
as
the
ellessen
or
lilienfeld
instead
of
a
heel
binding
as
most
hired
skis
have
the
huitfeldt
heel
binding
it
is
essential
to
ensure
that
boots
are
of
the
very
best
gloves
are
another
very
important
item
of
clothing
they
should
be
waterproof
this
is
easy
to
say
but
very
difficult
to
obtain
the
rub
of
the
stick
on
the
palm
of
the
hand
tends
to
sodden
almost
any
material
snow
also
gets
inside
during
a
fall
and
then
of
course
even
the
waterproof
glove
comes
home
wet
the
best
gloves
are
paws
made
of
thick
and
lined
with
wool
they
should
have
long
gauntlets
wide
enough
to
pull
up
over
the
sleeves
and
they
should
be
joined
by
a
string
going
round
behind
the
neck
under
the
coat
collar
long
enough
to
allow
of
free
use
of
the
hands
and
this
string
should
have
another
string
joining
it
across
the
chest
it
is
often
necessary
to
slip
off
a
glove
and
if
they
are
not
safely
hung
round
the
neck
they
fall
in
the
snow
which
promptly
runs
inside
or
they
may
be
dropped
and
lost
socks
are
a
matter
for
individual
choice
some
people
like
socks
which
have
many
of
the
qualities
or
disqualities
of
a
hair
shirt
they
are
prickly
and
therefore
perfect
as
a
under
very
cold
conditions
but
far
too
irritating
for
ordinary
wear
i
was
much
amused
in
a
london
shop
last
winter
when
i
heard
a
expert
advising
a
lady
not
to
buy
those
repulsive
socks
when
she
had
bought
what
he
advised
i
said
i
had
come
especially
to
buy
a
repulsive
pair
of
socks
he
immediately
explained
that
he
had
advised
the
lady
not
to
get
them
because
they
only
had
two
pairs
left
and
he
did
not
want
to
sell
them
he
let
me
have
a
pair
and
the
only
time
i
wore
them
i
thought
with
amusement
of
his
advice
and
explanation
the
lady
was
undoubtedly
well
out
of
them
and
i
hope
never
to
use
them
again
some
people
swear
by
them
so
all
tastes
must
be
allowed
for
it
seems
to
me
better
to
wear
two
thin
pairs
of
socks
in
addition
to
stockings
rather
than
one
pair
of
thick
socks
if
these
seem
to
fill
the
toes
of
the
boot
too
much
the
toe
part
of
one
pair
of
socks
can
be
cut
off
the
remainder
being
worn
as
an
anklet
swanks
or
norwegian
puttees
may
be
used
to
tie
the
socks
above
or
over
the
boot
so
as
to
prevent
the
snow
from
getting
inside
or
shooting
anklets
may
also
be
used
granted
that
they
are
large
enough
to
go
over
the
wide
uppers
of
a
ski
boot
as
well
as
the
socks
footgear
for
is
not
elegant
but
as
every
one
wears
the
same
nobody
need
feel
shy
it
is
another
reason
for
buying
in
switzerland
ski
boots
of
the
right
size
bought
in
a
london
shop
look
so
gargantuan
that
people
will
often
insist
on
having
a
smaller
pair
than
is
really
useful
when
the
time
comes
to
wear
them
spare
clothing
should
invariably
be
carried
on
any
run
beyond
the
nursery
slopes
as
in
case
of
an
accident
and
delay
in
fetching
help
a
runner
who
is
hurt
may
be
badly
this
of
course
only
applies
to
high
places
during
the
months
of
december
january
and
early
february
when
the
thermometer
may
often
register
of
frost
or
more
after
the
sun
goes
down
when
choosing
equipment
it
is
wise
therefore
to
remember
spare
clothing
which
should
include
a
cardigan
or
jersey
a
dry
pair
of
woollen
gloves
a
dry
pair
of
socks
or
stockings
a
warm
cap
of
some
sort
to
cover
the
ears
and
a
scarf
all
these
should
be
chosen
for
a
combination
of
warmth
and
lightness
a
is
often
recommended
some
people
carry
a
thin
silk
or
oil
silk
or
even
chamois
leather
or
paper
waistcoat
to
put
on
under
their
coats
when
a
wind
blows
this
is
not
necessary
for
any
but
long
tours
in
midwinter
a
very
useful
coat
specially
made
for
can
be
bought
in
most
swiss
and
is
excellent
the
great
thing
to
remember
about
clothing
for
is
that
climbing
uphill
you
will
probably
get
very
hot
and
perspire
freely
to
stop
in
a
biting
wind
in
this
condition
without
putting
on
spare
clothing
is
obviously
risky
it
is
difficult
to
ski
freely
in
heavy
thick
clothes
so
that
everything
should
be
warm
and
loose
and
made
of
wool
except
perhaps
the
or
the
swiss
coat
which
can
be
worn
over
a
sweater
cotton
or
linen
underclothing
will
probably
soon
be
discarded
but
this
is
a
personal
matter
and
need
not
be
dealt
with
here
equipment
the
minimum
amount
of
equipment
should
be
purchased
before
going
out
the
swiss
shops
are
just
as
well
provided
with
necessities
as
the
british
and
it
is
expensive
to
take
out
heavy
luggage
most
swiss
hotels
will
gladly
store
skis
or
gear
of
any
kind
through
the
summer
and
these
can
be
posted
or
forwarded
by
rail
to
any
place
the
runner
chooses
for
the
following
season
clothing
has
been
dealt
with
in
a
former
chapter
here
i
propose
to
describe
the
equipment
which
i
know
from
experience
to
be
useful
skis
can
be
bought
in
england
or
in
switzerland
one
or
two
english
firms
such
as
lillywhite
which
really
take
pains
to
obtain
the
best
possible
quality
of
goods
may
be
trusted
to
provide
norwegian
skis
but
there
are
also
several
makers
of
good
skis
in
switzerland
skis
should
be
made
either
of
hickory
or
ash
other
woods
such
as
birch
and
walnut
have
been
tried
but
these
do
not
appear
to
make
as
satisfactory
skis
as
hickory
or
ash
hickory
is
heavy
so
that
the
beginner
will
do
well
to
get
ash
skis
in
the
first
instance
their
average
length
should
be
the
height
of
the
runner
with
his
arm
extended
above
his
head
the
tip
of
the
ski
when
standing
upright
being
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
his
fingers
just
able
to
bend
over
it
when
the
novice
becomes
more
proficient
he
may
like
to
try
longer
or
shorter
skis
but
the
average
length
is
best
to
begin
with
good
makers
such
as
bjornsted
in
bern
or
staub
at
zurich
may
be
trusted
to
make
their
skis
right
proportionately
and
the
buyer
need
not
worry
about
their
width
or
depth
so
long
as
the
length
is
right
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
line
of
a
ski
as
there
is
in
a
boat
flat
ones
are
ugly
compared
with
those
which
hump
along
the
centre
but
they
are
also
lighter
it
seems
to
me
wise
for
the
beginner
to
hire
his
first
skis
rather
than
to
buy
them
most
of
the
sports
shops
in
the
different
centres
are
very
obliging
and
will
allow
their
clients
to
try
two
or
three
pairs
of
skis
in
order
to
experience
the
difference
between
them
they
should
not
curve
up
too
abruptly
in
front
and
they
should
be
about
one
inch
apart
in
the
centre
when
laid
flat
one
against
the
other
this
spring
adds
greatly
to
the
comfort
of
running
and
should
be
maintained
by
the
ski
having
a
block
of
wood
between
them
when
put
away
for
the
summer
or
even
when
laid
by
for
two
or
three
days
the
question
of
binding
is
a
very
serious
one
broadly
there
are
three
different
types
toe
bindings
by
which
only
the
toe
of
the
boot
is
attached
to
the
ski
solid
binding
with
a
sole
attached
to
the
ski
leather
heel
bindings
i
have
tried
two
forms
of
toe
bindings
the
and
the
and
gave
them
up
for
the
following
reasons
firstly
i
think
it
a
dangerous
binding
there
is
practically
no
give
at
all
so
that
in
a
bad
fall
when
the
foot
is
twisted
under
one
if
the
ski
does
not
move
the
leg
has
to
give
way
and
may
be
broken
i
think
surgeons
agree
that
there
are
more
accidents
as
a
result
of
wearing
a
binding
than
any
other
so
that
it
seems
to
me
much
better
to
start
with
another
type
of
binding
and
then
go
into
the
later
if
preferred
another
drawback
is
that
as
the
whole
pivotal
pressure
in
a
turn
is
borne
by
the
toe
iron
when
a
binding
is
worn
the
toe
irons
are
always
being
forced
open
not
only
that
but
the
spring
on
the
ski
which
holds
the
hook
on
the
boot
is
so
strong
that
it
tends
to
pull
the
boot
through
the
toe
irons
so
that
gradually
the
boot
gets
longer
and
more
pointed
and
the
spring
no
longer
holds
all
this
criticism
may
be
due
to
prejudice
on
my
part
but
i
have
tried
the
with
enthusiasm
and
only
gave
it
up
because
i
was
convinced
that
a
heel
binding
was
more
satisfactory
since
i
tried
it
two
or
three
new
forms
of
toe
binding
have
been
put
on
the
market
the
simplest
of
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
davos
form
which
is
merely
a
strap
fixed
to
the
ski
with
an
iron
loop
at
the
end
to
fit
into
the
hook
on
the
boot
and
an
ordinary
huitfeldt
spring
buckle
to
fix
it
firmly
solid
bindings
the
commonest
forms
of
these
are
the
ellesen
lilienfeld
and
bilgeri
but
as
i
have
never
tried
any
of
them
i
can
say
nothing
about
them
heel
bindings
there
are
two
main
forms
of
these
the
lap
thong
and
the
huitfeldt
the
lap
thong
is
merely
a
long
strap
of
raw
hide
or
leather
a
loop
is
drawn
through
the
hole
under
the
toe
iron
the
long
end
is
taken
round
the
heel
and
through
the
loop
then
back
round
the
heel
and
through
a
slit
in
the
other
or
short
end
the
long
end
is
then
carried
under
the
foot
and
round
the
instep
and
finally
tied
off
with
a
knot
this
has
been
improved
upon
by
a
ring
and
buckle
being
added
to
save
slitting
the
leather
or
knotting
the
ends
the
huitfeldt
binding
is
a
thick
strap
which
buckles
round
the
whole
foot
and
has
a
strong
spring
to
pull
it
taut
when
the
binding
has
been
slipped
on
to
the
heel
this
is
the
usual
binding
on
hired
skis
i
have
tried
both
these
bindings
and
now
wear
a
scheer
binding
which
is
a
combination
of
the
two
the
long
lap
thong
with
buckles
and
also
a
spring
similar
to
the
one
tightening
a
huitfeldt
binding
the
chief
drawback
to
a
lap
binding
was
that
it
took
time
to
put
on
so
that
fingers
got
very
cold
and
clumsy
when
fitting
it
before
a
run
down
from
a
height
the
trouble
about
a
huitfeldt
binding
is
that
it
is
thick
and
clumsy
and
the
buckles
stick
out
so
that
they
catch
in
the
snow
when
running
the
scheer
binding
avoids
these
drawbacks
it
is
put
on
just
as
easily
as
a
huitfeldt
and
the
thin
thong
lies
so
closely
along
the
boot
that
there
is
nothing
to
catch
in
the
snow
it
is
very
easily
lengthened
or
shortened
when
the
leather
contracts
or
stretches
and
this
is
also
a
great
comfort
this
binding
being
new
may
not
yet
be
obtainable
everywhere
but
it
is
well
worth
trying
to
get
the
huitfeldt
and
scheer
bindings
both
tend
to
give
a
little
in
a
strained
fall
so
that
the
foot
slips
round
and
the
leg
is
usually
saved
toe
irons
pass
through
the
ski
under
the
toes
and
come
up
either
side
to
hold
the
foot
in
place
they
should
be
carefully
fitted
and
with
a
view
to
this
the
boots
should
be
left
overnight
with
the
sports
shop
and
the
skis
fetched
next
day
the
boot
should
lie
quite
straight
along
the
ski
if
the
toe
irons
do
not
fit
properly
the
boot
will
be
on
the
ski
and
too
much
free
play
may
take
place
i
have
often
seen
beginners
take
advantage
of
this
to
stick
their
heels
out
and
off
the
ski
into
the
snow
to
help
them
uphill
or
to
act
as
a
brake
downhill
they
will
rue
it
downhill
however
as
the
foot
should
be
firmly
held
on
the
ski
or
control
will
be
impossible
toe
irons
are
sometimes
made
of
very
soft
metal
these
are
usually
attached
to
skis
hired
out
by
the
sports
shops
in
order
that
they
may
be
easily
fitted
to
the
many
different
shaped
feet
of
the
hirers
when
getting
toe
irons
fitted
to
one
own
skis
it
is
wise
to
ask
for
strong
ones
as
the
soft
irons
give
too
freely
to
the
pivotal
action
of
the
feet
in
turns
and
tend
to
be
constantly
opening
and
becoming
loose
toe
irons
are
often
used
in
conjunction
with
toe
bindings
in
order
to
avoid
the
difficulty
of
the
irons
being
forced
open
by
the
boot
being
pulled
through
by
the
spring
these
irons
have
one
great
fault
they
have
to
be
screwed
on
to
the
ski
and
are
very
cold
under
the
foot
this
may
be
considered
imagination
but
i
believe
it
to
be
true
in
which
case
it
may
be
prejudice
the
toe
irons
are
joined
over
the
toes
by
a
leather
pulled
through
and
buckled
the
irons
should
be
so
high
that
this
strap
does
not
press
at
all
on
the
boot
or
restrict
the
free
play
of
the
toes
the
whole
binding
should
be
so
fitted
that
it
is
possible
to
kneel
down
on
one
skis
foot
plates
are
nailed
on
the
ski
under
the
foot
these
are
usually
made
of
linoleum
or
aluminium
i
prefer
a
thick
plain
aluminium
plate
and
find
that
the
snow
does
not
stick
to
it
when
the
skis
have
been
chosen
sticks
have
to
be
provided
a
pair
of
sticks
should
be
used
one
being
carried
in
each
hand
they
are
usually
made
of
hazel
or
bamboo
the
latter
are
light
but
tend
to
split
i
always
use
hazel
which
are
cheaper
and
very
satisfactory
sticks
should
be
so
long
that
they
reach
to
just
above
the
waist
and
should
not
be
very
heavy
though
strong
sticks
are
necessary
for
all
real
touring
they
should
have
padded
leather
knobs
at
the
tops
as
these
prevent
the
stick
from
slipping
out
of
the
hand
and
being
dropped
during
a
run
as
well
as
saving
the
hand
from
blisters
when
the
stick
is
much
used
in
practising
lifted
stem
or
jump
turns
wooden
knobs
are
often
used
but
these
tend
to
get
coated
with
ice
which
wets
the
glove
and
is
uncomfortable
a
leather
or
webbing
thong
is
passed
through
the
stick
or
nailed
under
the
knob
as
a
loop
to
hang
them
up
by
but
should
never
be
put
round
the
wrist
except
for
uphill
work
as
the
wrist
might
easily
be
broken
in
a
bad
fall
if
the
stick
be
attached
to
it
my
great
idea
is
to
get
rid
of
my
sticks
in
a
fall
as
i
once
impaled
my
leg
on
the
spike
of
my
stick
in
a
somersault
i
was
thankful
that
the
spike
was
a
short
one
and
not
one
of
the
newfangled
aluminium
spikes
which
would
have
penetrated
much
further
and
might
easily
have
done
damage
to
the
bone
only
a
short
spike
is
necessary
just
long
enough
to
go
into
crusted
snow
and
hold
the
discs
round
the
bottom
of
sticks
should
be
large
about
seven
inches
in
diameter
and
they
should
be
loose
so
that
they
will
lie
flat
with
the
ski
when
packed
i
prefer
them
put
on
with
a
thong
which
passes
through
the
stick
and
is
crossed
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
disc
allowing
of
plenty
of
free
play
in
the
disc
by
this
means
the
thong
does
not
cut
where
it
passes
through
the
stick
discs
are
often
made
almost
solid
and
then
fixed
to
the
stick
with
an
iron
hasp
which
is
apt
to
snap
or
to
split
the
stick
sticks
hired
out
with
skis
usually
have
small
discs
and
no
knobs
and
most
beginners
will
soon
wish
to
possess
their
own
pair
which
only
cost
about
twelve
francs
a
word
of
advice
here
keep
your
sticks
in
your
bedroom
even
in
the
best
circles
sticks
sometimes
disappear
and
once
your
own
sticks
go
you
are
tempted
to
take
anybody
else
and
so
the
mischief
goes
on
the
rucksack
is
a
very
important
item
of
equipment
it
should
be
waterproof
and
large
even
if
you
do
not
intend
to
carry
much
nothing
is
more
uncomfortable
than
a
small
full
rucksack
perching
like
a
football
on
one
back
by
the
time
a
packed
lunch
and
a
cardigan
as
well
as
some
spare
gear
is
stuffed
into
the
sack
it
swells
two
outside
pockets
and
one
large
inside
division
are
indispensable
keep
wax
scraper
string
in
one
outside
pocket
ready
to
hand
map
in
the
other
leather
shoulder
straps
are
the
best
as
they
do
not
cut
the
shoulder
in
the
same
way
as
webbing
i
once
hunted
a
great
many
london
shops
in
vain
for
a
rucksack
with
leather
shoulder
straps
they
all
had
thin
webbing
which
soon
turns
into
a
wisp
and
hurts
the
muscles
of
the
shoulder
the
leather
straps
should
finish
on
a
ring
at
the
top
which
should
be
attached
to
the
top
of
the
rucksack
by
a
leather
tab
firmly
sewn
on
this
is
a
much
safer
system
than
running
the
string
which
pulls
up
the
top
of
the
sack
through
the
shoulder
straps
at
the
back
because
the
pull
on
the
string
chafes
it
and
gradually
cuts
through
it
some
experienced
runners
prefer
the
bergans
rucksack
on
an
aluminium
frame
it
is
unquestionably
heavier
than
the
ordinary
sack
but
the
frame
resting
on
the
hips
helps
to
distribute
the
weight
and
it
is
said
to
be
less
tiring
to
carry
another
joy
about
it
is
that
the
frame
keeps
the
sack
off
the
back
so
that
there
is
an
air
space
and
the
usual
poultice
effect
of
an
ordinary
rucksack
is
avoided
there
are
many
different
types
of
rucksack
to
be
had
in
switzerland
they
should
be
waterproof
and
as
the
waterproof
material
is
very
expensive
now
a
good
serviceable
sack
costs
at
least
frs
to
the
better
rucksacks
have
straps
fixed
outside
for
carrying
one
coat
or
possibly
sealskins
sohms
skins
should
be
carried
inside
the
sack
i
advise
people
to
carry
the
various
contents
of
their
sacks
in
different
bags
or
tied
up
in
handkerchiefs
this
may
sound
but
it
is
a
trick
i
learnt
from
swiss
climbers
and
i
am
very
thankful
anyone
who
has
hurriedly
searched
his
sack
for
some
particular
bit
of
gear
knows
the
sort
of
haystack
which
results
while
if
equipment
sealskins
spare
bindings
emergency
rations
mending
outfit
are
all
carried
in
separate
differently
coloured
bundles
inside
the
sack
endless
time
is
saved
this
is
particularly
worth
considering
in
a
blizzard
when
fingers
are
cold
and
nothing
can
be
found
skins
are
used
for
climbing
uphill
on
tour
they
consist
of
long
strips
of
sealskin
which
are
attached
to
the
running
surface
of
the
skis
the
hairs
lying
towards
the
back
of
the
ski
catch
in
the
snow
and
prevent
the
skis
from
slipping
backwards
which
is
a
great
help
and
saving
of
energy
the
skis
can
be
kept
in
good
slipping
condition
with
oil
or
wax
and
when
the
skins
are
taken
off
at
the
top
of
a
run
very
little
further
preparation
is
necessary
there
are
two
forms
of
sealskins
sohms
skins
which
are
attached
to
the
skis
with
wax
those
made
up
on
canvas
with
straps
to
fix
them
to
the
skis
the
latter
can
usually
be
hired
by
the
day
for
about
frs
from
the
local
sports
shop
and
cost
about
frs
to
buy
most
runners
now
use
the
sohms
skins
the
great
gain
being
that
one
can
run
downhill
almost
as
well
when
they
are
still
on
so
that
on
a
tour
with
one
or
two
short
descents
the
skis
may
be
left
on
waxes
are
of
many
kinds
and
some
runners
not
content
with
what
they
buy
prefer
to
mix
their
own
the
waxes
most
used
in
switzerland
are
skiolin
both
hard
and
soft
sohms
with
red
yellow
or
green
label
and
parafine
i
have
found
that
hard
skiolin
ironed
into
the
running
surface
of
the
ski
with
a
hot
iron
provides
a
good
surface
sohms
wax
being
a
climbing
wax
is
apt
to
stick
to
some
kinds
of
snow
and
if
sohms
skins
have
been
used
it
is
wise
to
scrape
all
this
wax
off
before
the
run
down
and
to
polish
the
ski
with
parafine
wax
if
it
needs
a
finish
on
hard
snow
this
is
not
necessary
some
waxes
are
used
as
climbing
wax
instead
of
skins
but
as
different
sorts
are
needed
for
different
types
of
snow
they
complicate
life
almost
more
than
is
worth
while
a
very
good
permanent
surface
on
skis
is
obtained
by
oiling
them
repeatedly
with
linseed
oil
allowing
them
to
dry
thoroughly
between
each
coat
of
oil
this
is
a
somewhat
lengthy
process
and
an
impossible
one
if
the
skis
are
in
daily
use
but
it
is
much
the
best
method
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
season
the
best
sohms
skins
are
dark
grey
or
black
and
they
cost
about
frs
the
leather
surface
should
be
carefully
waxed
with
green
label
sohms
wax
before
starting
on
an
expedition
the
wax
should
be
very
thinly
spread
and
it
is
wise
to
get
this
job
done
at
leisure
overnight
and
to
lay
the
skins
together
with
their
waxed
surfaces
touching
and
to
keep
them
in
a
warm
room
but
not
near
a
heater
or
stove
when
starting
on
an
excursion
wear
the
skins
wound
round
your
body
under
your
coat
so
that
they
remain
warm
and
supple
until
required
then
wax
the
running
surfaces
of
the
skis
with
yellow
label
sohms
wax
as
sparingly
as
possible
it
should
be
spread
smoothly
and
without
lumps
when
putting
on
the
skins
lay
them
along
the
skis
from
the
tip
towards
the
back
and
run
your
thumb
down
the
line
of
the
centre
groove
in
the
ski
while
you
press
the
skin
on
evenly
over
the
whole
ski
new
skins
are
apt
to
shrink
after
use
so
it
is
better
not
to
cut
the
strap
which
slips
over
the
tip
of
the
ski
the
best
plan
is
to
make
a
second
slit
in
this
strap
and
slip
it
on
and
then
if
the
skin
is
still
too
long
turn
the
end
part
up
over
the
ski
at
the
back
sticking
it
on
with
wax
then
when
the
skins
have
been
used
for
two
or
three
days
it
is
easier
to
decide
what
length
the
strap
should
be
having
put
your
skins
on
lay
the
skis
flat
on
the
snow
so
that
the
skins
will
freeze
on
sealskins
must
never
be
dried
by
a
heater
or
stove
as
the
heat
shrivels
them
and
they
are
ruined
when
not
in
use
they
can
be
kept
rolled
up
in
a
bag
and
should
be
carried
in
the
rucksack
rather
than
hanging
on
outside
frozen
skins
are
very
difficult
to
attach
a
scraper
should
invariably
be
carried
when
even
on
the
nursery
slopes
these
are
made
of
aluminium
and
the
best
type
has
a
groove
which
will
fit
into
the
groove
of
the
ski
and
scrape
this
as
well
as
the
flat
surface
as
ice
is
apt
to
adhere
there
also
some
runners
carry
attached
to
their
belt
a
norwegian
hunting
knife
in
its
case
this
is
excellent
for
scraping
the
skis
and
for
any
purpose
for
which
a
strong
knife
may
be
wanted
but
it
always
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
nasty
thing
to
fall
on
a
strong
ordinary
knife
should
invariably
be
carried
the
swiss
military
knife
is
the
best
possible
as
it
seems
to
include
practically
everything
necessary
a
really
good
one
costs
about
frs
or
frs
though
inferior
steel
may
be
had
for
a
great
deal
less
it
should
have
a
ring
and
be
attached
to
the
belt
dark
spectacles
or
goggles
should
be
included
in
equipment
a
mending
outfit
is
often
needed
and
at
least
one
member
of
every
party
going
on
tour
should
carry
something
with
which
to
mend
broken
skis
there
are
many
patterns
of
spare
ski
tip
on
the
market
all
of
which
may
be
useful
in
certain
circumstances
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
wooden
ski
tip
is
the
best
it
is
just
an
ordinary
front
part
of
a
ski
about
two
feet
long
and
planed
off
so
that
it
will
lie
close
to
the
broken
ski
this
is
fixed
on
by
metal
clamps
which
are
made
on
purpose
and
can
be
bought
in
most
winter
sports
shops
holes
at
different
intervals
fitting
the
clamps
which
should
be
put
on
lengthwise
may
be
bored
beforehand
in
the
ski
tip
in
order
to
save
time
when
the
tip
may
be
needed
on
tour
the
gimlet
supplied
with
the
clamps
is
usually
a
poor
one
and
i
always
carry
a
spare
gimlet
a
little
larger
than
is
necessary
as
it
is
difficult
to
make
the
holes
in
exactly
the
right
place
in
a
broken
ski
cold
and
clumsy
hands
have
always
to
be
reckoned
with
when
the
clamps
being
somewhat
roughly
made
are
apt
to
break
so
that
one
should
carry
at
least
five
pairs
in
putting
them
on
take
care
not
to
drop
the
little
square
nut
off
the
bolt
into
powder
snow
as
it
sinks
at
once
and
may
be
irretrievably
lost
other
makes
of
spare
ski
tips
include
one
made
of
cast
aluminium
produced
by
lillywhite
who
will
probably
improve
upon
it
as
at
present
it
seems
to
me
to
be
too
flat
the
method
of
fixing
it
is
however
a
good
one
the
swiss
sports
shops
also
keep
light
tips
made
of
tin
and
copper
which
are
affixed
by
various
methods
but
they
are
usually
too
short
and
thin
to
be
more
than
a
makeshift
if
a
ski
is
broken
near
the
front
the
wooden
ski
tip
when
properly
adjusted
enables
one
to
run
any
distance
quite
comfortably
and
even
permits
of
turns
it
is
clumsy
to
carry
except
in
a
bergans
rucksack
a
long
narrow
pocket
might
be
sewn
diagonally
across
the
back
of
an
ordinary
rucksack
in
which
to
carry
it
but
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
uncomfortable
i
tried
such
a
pocket
vertically
and
found
it
quite
intolerable
and
even
dangerous
in
some
falls
mending
outfit
must
also
include
a
spare
binding
and
a
toe
strap
as
well
as
some
string
and
cord
wire
and
two
or
three
leather
the
best
spare
binding
to
carry
is
a
lap
thong
as
it
is
easier
to
push
through
than
a
huitfeldt
unless
a
thin
single
strap
is
carried
for
the
front
part
of
the
latter
in
any
case
a
bit
of
wire
facilitates
the
pulling
through
of
the
thong
or
strap
an
inexperienced
runner
who
has
not
used
a
lap
thong
should
try
fitting
one
at
home
before
depending
on
it
in
emergency
as
it
is
a
little
tricky
to
put
on
at
first
runners
going
any
distance
on
tour
should
carry
some
sort
of
equipment
it
need
not
be
elaborate
but
should
include
bandages
a
clean
dressing
a
first
field
dressing
is
the
best
and
most
compact
iodine
and
adhesive
plaster
and
some
vaseline
or
boracic
ointment
even
a
scratch
will
go
on
bleeding
on
a
cold
day
and
be
very
tiresome
accidents
are
miraculously
few
and
far
between
in
considering
the
falls
and
the
large
number
of
people
who
ski
but
they
happen
occasionally
and
it
is
as
well
to
be
prepared
the
list
of
gear
could
be
prolonged
to
any
extent
as
what
to
carry
in
my
rucksack
becomes
an
enthralling
hobby
everyone
will
eventually
decide
what
he
thinks
he
ought
to
have
in
order
to
come
home
with
a
free
conscience
after
any
eventuality
another
runner
has
suggested
my
adding
a
pair
of
small
pincers
a
pocket
tool
outfit
matches
or
fusees
an
electric
torch
scissors
weight
has
to
be
considered
as
the
more
the
ski
runner
carries
the
greater
the
effort
but
there
is
undoubtedly
great
satisfaction
in
feeling
that
one
has
everything
which
might
be
helpful
in
any
emergency
if
three
or
four
runners
are
going
together
the
whole
gear
can
be
distributed
among
them
but
this
makes
it
more
necessary
than
ever
for
the
party
to
keep
together
as
a
spare
ski
tip
or
similar
luxury
is
no
use
at
the
bottom
of
a
run
when
the
accident
is
near
the
top
even
if
one
does
not
need
all
the
gear
oneself
it
seems
better
to
be
prepared
to
help
other
people
who
are
in
difficulties
the
following
lists
show
firstly
what
i
think
every
runner
going
several
miles
beyond
home
ought
to
carry
and
secondly
what
a
great
many
runners
carry
in
addition
a
strong
knife
with
corkscrew
leather
punch
tin
opener
etc
a
ski
tip
gimlet
and
mending
outfit
wire
string
and
cord
spare
binding
and
toe
strap
dark
yellow
glasses
triplex
are
safest
siren
or
strong
whistle
emergency
ration
of
some
sort
such
as
chocolate
raisins
dates
spare
clothing
including
cardigan
or
sweater
dry
gloves
dry
socks
scarf
cap
to
cover
ears
equipment
map
wax
and
scraper
some
runners
carry
all
these
things
and
the
following
besides
matches
lantern
folding
or
electric
torch
aneroid
compass
pincers
hammer
brandy
thermos
with
some
hot
drink
a
great
many
people
will
laugh
at
me
for
suggesting
all
this
gear
but
i
do
so
out
of
experience
when
one
has
some
years
with
a
good
many
people
one
looks
back
with
amusement
to
the
number
of
times
when
one
has
been
asked
to
provide
any
of
the
above
people
go
out
without
spare
clothing
food
equipment
repair
outfit
something
happens
and
they
at
once
look
round
to
see
where
they
can
borrow
now
borrowing
is
not
part
of
the
game
and
every
runner
should
be
independent
it
is
easy
when
going
on
tour
to
divide
up
the
gear
so
that
every
member
of
the
party
carries
his
share
it
is
not
necessary
for
each
member
to
carry
the
whole
of
what
i
have
shown
let
each
carry
enough
to
feel
and
let
the
party
carry
enough
not
only
for
their
own
needs
but
also
for
any
other
runner
in
distress
whom
they
may
come
across
should
be
an
unselfish
sport
at
a
certain
centre
one
winter
word
was
brought
in
at
about
by
a
member
of
a
party
of
three
that
one
of
his
companions
was
lying
in
the
forest
about
a
mile
away
with
a
badly
broken
leg
three
runners
dashed
off
from
the
nursery
slopes
with
the
man
who
brought
the
news
to
show
them
the
way
i
posted
a
friend
to
watch
where
they
entered
the
wood
while
two
other
strong
runners
fetched
clothing
and
hot
drinks
in
a
thermos
somebody
else
called
up
the
rettung
chef
and
the
doctor
all
this
help
was
mobilized
within
an
hour
meanwhile
the
man
was
lying
in
the
snow
in
the
wood
with
a
badly
broken
lower
leg
the
sun
had
set
and
the
temperature
very
low
not
one
of
the
party
had
any
spare
clothing
or
gear
of
any
sort
a
sensible
man
who
had
been
one
of
the
first
three
to
go
off
from
the
slopes
told
me
afterwards
that
if
hot
drink
and
clothing
had
not
come
soon
he
was
convinced
that
the
man
would
have
died
as
it
was
he
was
nearly
unconscious
and
his
pulse
had
nearly
stopped
dark
came
on
and
the
doctor
and
the
ambulance
sledge
did
not
arrive
instead
of
going
the
way
the
others
had
disappeared
they
tried
a
route
they
thought
easier
and
took
too
high
a
line
in
the
forest
the
trees
muffled
sound
and
though
both
parties
were
shouting
and
whistling
they
heard
nothing
till
at
about
one
of
the
watchers
heard
a
runner
near
and
went
off
after
him
in
the
dark
and
luckily
found
him
this
man
was
scouting
for
the
doctor
and
sledge
and
finally
brought
them
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
at
by
this
time
some
one
or
two
of
the
watchers
had
gone
home
nearly
frozen
leaving
all
possible
clothing
on
the
injured
man
three
others
stayed
and
rubbed
him
without
intermission
which
probably
saved
his
life
and
limbs
the
doctor
had
brought
a
splint
which
he
put
on
by
light
of
an
electric
torch
and
the
man
was
taken
to
the
station
and
sent
off
at
once
to
the
hospital
now
all
this
happened
within
a
mile
of
home
where
help
was
handy
such
accidents
happening
several
miles
from
home
may
have
far
more
serious
consequences
and
every
ski
runner
who
scoffs
at
the
precautions
of
people
more
fussy
than
themselves
may
very
likely
have
the
life
or
limb
of
someone
else
on
their
mind
when
had
they
been
a
little
more
fussy
they
might
have
saved
it
not
only
that
the
selfish
runner
who
travels
light
may
well
be
a
serious
burden
to
others
and
risk
their
safety
and
comfort
through
his
own
foolhardiness
is
a
game
which
sorts
people
out
and
where
the
character
of
people
like
sailors
who
know
what
it
is
to
face
the
elements
shows
up
well
against
the
civilian
whose
greatest
risk
in
life
at
home
is
crossing
a
street
at
a
busy
hour
people
may
ski
for
years
without
getting
hurt
and
the
experienced
runner
probably
hurts
himself
less
than
the
beginner
yet
it
is
the
experienced
runner
who
carries
the
gear
the
beginner
it
is
who
usually
scoffs
and
takes
risks
not
only
to
himself
but
to
the
people
who
have
to
go
out
to
look
for
him
when
he
is
benighted
or
hurt
care
of
equipment
skis
call
for
a
good
deal
of
attention
if
one
takes
the
game
seriously
people
who
only
come
out
for
a
fortnight
and
who
hire
any
pair
of
skis
which
they
treat
as
they
would
the
floor
of
an
omnibus
have
no
appreciation
of
how
much
attention
skis
need
if
they
are
to
be
really
dependable
in
all
sorts
of
snow
new
skis
should
be
with
two
or
three
coats
of
linseed
oil
which
should
dry
between
each
coat
i
think
hickory
needs
the
oil
just
as
much
as
ash
but
some
people
disagree
with
this
the
oil
hardly
goes
beyond
the
surface
of
the
wood
and
soon
rubs
off
on
hard
snow
but
it
preserves
the
wood
as
well
as
giving
a
slipping
surface
so
long
as
it
lasts
newly
oiled
skis
when
dry
need
very
little
further
attention
for
a
few
days
as
they
will
run
well
over
all
sorts
of
snow
when
there
is
no
time
to
oil
because
the
skis
are
in
daily
use
wax
can
be
ironed
in
most
good
sports
hotels
now
provide
a
bench
with
an
electric
iron
in
a
special
heated
and
lighted
room
where
the
can
work
happily
after
tea
or
on
a
snowy
day
if
no
such
room
be
provided
it
should
be
clamoured
for
because
the
waxing
of
skis
is
a
much
more
difficult
job
without
it
the
patent
iron
para
is
helpful
where
no
electric
iron
is
provided
para
is
an
oblong
perforated
metal
box
with
a
handle
which
screws
in
a
lump
of
meta
solid
spirit
fuel
is
lighted
and
put
inside
and
the
iron
becomes
hot
and
is
rubbed
up
and
down
the
ski
while
wax
is
pressed
against
it
and
dribbled
on
to
the
wood
almost
any
wax
can
be
ironed
in
but
i
think
the
hard
black
skiolin
is
best
for
the
purpose
be
careful
to
wax
the
groove
as
well
as
the
flat
surface
of
the
ski
when
skis
are
put
away
for
the
summer
the
upper
as
well
as
the
running
surfaces
should
be
oiled
or
in
order
to
preserve
the
wood
leather
bindings
may
be
well
oiled
with
special
boot
oil
to
keep
them
supple
skis
should
never
be
kept
in
a
hot
place
as
they
are
apt
to
warp
but
they
should
be
kept
dry
when
put
away
boots
should
never
be
dried
by
a
fire
or
on
a
heater
but
should
be
stored
in
a
cool
place
they
need
occasional
oiling
of
the
uppers
with
some
sort
of
boot
oil
dubbin
may
also
be
used
and
is
good
for
filling
places
such
as
between
the
sole
and
the
upper
the
soles
should
never
be
oiled
except
perhaps
with
linseed
oil
which
hardens
the
leather
i
think
the
wisest
plan
is
to
leave
the
soles
dry
but
if
snow
balls
on
them
they
can
be
waxed
with
ski
wax
this
is
often
specially
necessary
on
the
heel
if
boots
be
put
outside
the
bedroom
every
night
the
porter
will
oil
them
automatically
in
most
good
hotels
sealskins
should
be
wrapped
up
in
newspaper
and
stored
in
a
cool
place
when
put
away
moth
will
ruin
them
if
left
open
and
heat
crumples
them
making
them
useless
a
friend
told
me
that
when
her
seal
skis
webbing
ones
were
ruined
by
being
put
near
a
fire
she
recovered
them
by
soaking
them
in
salad
oil
she
was
certainly
using
them
quite
happily
afterwards
the
elements
of
this
book
does
not
profess
to
be
in
any
way
a
textbook
of
the
technique
of
as
stated
in
the
preface
my
only
idea
in
writing
it
is
to
provide
an
answer
to
a
good
many
questions
which
have
been
asked
me
every
year
anyone
who
deals
with
a
great
many
people
knows
that
there
are
always
some
fifty
stock
questions
which
can
quite
easily
be
answered
by
fifty
stock
answers
what
i
say
in
this
chapter
about
the
first
run
will
be
the
barest
elements
of
ski
running
beginners
should
obtain
either
arnold
lunn
books
or
those
of
vivien
caulfield
and
concentrate
on
the
theory
of
turns
i
have
known
two
or
three
novices
who
though
they
had
never
even
seen
skis
before
by
dint
of
studying
the
technique
in
theory
before
they
came
out
were
able
immediately
to
apply
it
in
practice
most
beginners
find
however
that
the
moment
the
skis
start
sliding
all
theory
is
thrown
to
the
winds
instinct
of
prevails
and
they
sit
down
kind
friends
looking
on
say
that
was
because
you
were
leaning
backwards
you
must
lean
forwards
off
they
start
again
carry
out
the
advice
their
skis
stick
for
some
reason
and
down
they
go
head
foremost
the
most
difficult
fall
of
all
to
get
up
from
and
the
most
aggravating
the
great
thing
is
not
to
do
too
much
the
first
two
days
after
coming
out
the
height
affects
people
more
than
they
realize
at
first
and
great
energy
due
to
the
bracing
air
is
often
followed
by
great
lassitude
most
people
are
not
in
training
and
tries
the
lungs
nerves
and
muscles
of
the
fittest
as
the
whole
system
seems
to
be
brought
into
play
a
few
hours
practice
on
the
nursery
slopes
is
usually
enough
for
the
first
two
or
three
days
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
beginner
seems
to
be
falling
more
than
when
he
first
began
half
or
even
a
whole
day
off
skis
will
produce
wonderful
results
in
better
balance
and
general
fitness
having
chosen
skis
and
ensured
that
the
toe
irons
and
binding
fit
you
go
out
to
some
gentle
slope
of
about
with
soft
snow
if
possible
set
your
skis
at
right
angles
to
or
across
the
fall
of
the
slope
before
putting
them
on
because
skis
are
quite
apt
to
go
off
alone
if
pointing
down
hill
it
is
as
well
to
realize
this
from
the
first
and
to
adopt
the
habit
of
preventing
it
in
the
way
i
suggest
because
many
a
run
has
been
ruined
by
a
ski
descending
alone
to
the
valley
below
leaving
its
owner
to
get
home
as
best
he
can
on
one
leg
even
if
it
only
goes
down
some
or
feet
the
friend
who
goes
after
it
and
brings
it
back
often
has
a
good
deal
to
say
and
you
are
lucky
if
the
ski
has
not
struck
a
rock
or
tree
and
got
broken
in
its
independent
run
it
is
no
good
getting
angry
on
these
occasions
i
once
watched
a
boy
on
a
distant
slope
who
had
been
obliged
to
descend
some
hundreds
of
feet
after
one
of
his
skis
when
he
got
hold
of
it
in
a
temper
he
started
beating
it
with
his
stick
and
continued
doing
so
till
the
stick
nearly
broke
while
on
the
subject
of
runaway
skis
i
may
as
well
warn
you
also
against
a
runaway
rucksack
i
put
mine
down
at
my
feet
on
a
steep
slope
while
i
took
off
my
coat
one
day
and
the
rucksack
started
sliding
slowly
down
below
us
the
party
was
made
up
of
beginners
and
we
had
ropes
on
our
skis
instead
of
skins
so
that
no
one
could
catch
it
up
till
it
stopped
about
feet
below
us
to
add
insult
to
injury
at
the
same
time
somebody
dropped
a
bit
at
the
same
moment
and
this
danced
off
down
into
the
valley
racing
the
rucksack
and
beating
it
hollow
but
to
return
to
the
start
the
skis
are
safely
lying
across
the
slope
and
you
are
going
to
put
them
on
put
on
the
lower
one
first
never
forget
this
because
it
will
often
prevent
a
runaway
ski
if
the
slope
is
very
steep
and
hard
you
should
stick
the
other
ski
upright
in
the
snow
above
you
in
order
that
it
may
remain
well
in
hand
while
you
put
on
the
first
you
will
probably
find
it
impossible
to
put
on
your
skis
with
gloves
on
if
you
lay
these
on
the
snow
they
will
undoubtedly
get
snow
inside
them
the
safest
place
to
put
them
is
one
on
each
stick
stuck
upright
on
either
side
of
you
or
tuck
them
into
your
belt
or
pockets
when
you
have
your
skis
and
gloves
on
and
everything
else
is
hermetically
sealed
you
are
ready
to
start
sliding
or
traversing
slowly
across
the
slope
before
going
straight
down
it
this
will
give
you
time
to
get
the
feeling
of
skis
which
are
clumsy
at
first
slide
one
foot
forward
then
the
other
but
do
not
lift
them
now
try
a
kick
turn
and
come
back
across
the
slopes
to
the
top
and
face
straight
downhill
keep
your
skis
closely
side
by
side
one
foot
leading
by
about
twelve
inches
and
push
yourself
off
with
your
sticks
try
to
imagine
that
the
skis
are
only
a
moving
staircase
and
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
upright
on
them
and
let
them
do
the
rest
if
your
slope
is
only
and
there
is
nothing
steeper
below
you
the
skis
wo
do
much
indeed
in
deep
snow
they
may
refuse
to
move
at
all
in
which
case
try
pushing
yourself
along
with
your
sticks
the
great
thing
is
always
to
want
to
run
faster
than
you
are
going
and
therefore
only
to
choose
slopes
where
you
feel
that
you
can
keep
up
as
fast
as
the
skis
go
it
is
a
mistake
to
start
immediately
down
such
a
steep
slope
that
the
skis
run
away
with
you
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
a
mistake
not
to
increase
the
angle
of
your
slope
as
soon
as
you
can
compete
with
it
stand
upright
press
the
knees
together
and
try
to
feel
that
there
is
a
spring
in
your
knees
let
one
or
other
foot
lead
so
that
if
the
skis
stop
the
front
foot
takes
your
weight
and
prevents
you
plunging
forwards
and
if
the
skis
suddenly
plunge
forward
the
back
foot
is
equally
ready
to
take
the
weight
and
prevents
you
from
sitting
down
whatever
you
do
avoid
the
hideous
position
of
a
runner
who
bends
at
waist
and
knees
with
feet
parallel
and
far
apart
looking
like
a
note
of
interrogation
and
leaving
what
we
call
tracks
by
his
tracks
shall
a
be
judged
look
back
and
see
the
line
you
have
left
if
your
two
feet
have
left
two
tracks
with
more
than
six
inches
apart
in
soft
snow
you
must
not
be
contented
in
a
good
track
the
two
feet
should
leave
one
track
but
some
bindings
make
this
impossible
so
that
unless
you
are
wearing
a
toe
binding
you
need
not
worry
about
a
gap
of
two
or
three
inches
between
your
feet
this
only
applies
to
soft
snow
running
on
hard
or
crusty
snow
it
is
almost
impossible
and
also
dangerous
to
keep
the
feet
together
when
you
have
begun
to
feel
at
home
on
skis
go
off
to
a
much
steeper
slope
and
try
traversing
choose
a
slope
which
has
flattish
ground
below
so
that
you
have
an
easy
and
nothing
to
make
you
nervous
remember
for
your
comfort
that
if
you
go
across
a
slope
leading
with
the
upper
foot
and
with
most
of
your
weight
on
the
lower
foot
standing
upright
and
if
anything
leaning
a
little
outwards
away
from
the
slope
you
can
traverse
across
almost
any
slope
without
difficulty
so
long
as
it
is
not
too
steep
for
the
snow
to
bear
your
weight
without
slipping
itself
nothing
is
more
comforting
to
a
beginner
than
to
realize
this
it
takes
away
the
feeling
of
giddiness
and
gives
confidence
but
it
needs
learning
and
should
be
practised
at
once
the
first
tendency
of
skis
on
a
steepish
slope
is
to
point
more
and
more
downhill
till
finally
having
intimidated
the
beginner
into
allowing
them
to
go
their
own
way
they
plunge
straight
down
and
the
beginner
collapses
to
counteract
this
put
more
weight
on
the
heel
and
less
on
the
toes
while
traversing
this
will
push
the
back
part
of
the
skis
down
and
the
front
part
uphill
across
the
slope
and
if
done
sufficiently
the
skis
will
stop
and
you
have
begun
to
get
some
feeling
of
control
when
traversing
standing
upright
the
inner
edge
of
your
skis
will
bite
into
the
snow
try
leaning
inwards
as
you
will
do
by
instinct
and
you
will
find
your
feet
slipping
away
down
the
slope
and
you
will
gracefully
recline
full
length
against
it
it
is
exactly
the
same
when
walking
across
a
steep
grass
slope
in
summer
most
of
the
slips
are
due
to
leaning
towards
instead
of
away
from
the
slopes
as
you
get
more
confidence
in
your
running
try
lifting
one
ski
off
the
ground
as
you
slide
along
or
even
take
off
one
ski
and
try
running
on
the
other
lifting
a
ski
will
often
save
a
fall
for
instance
if
the
skis
get
crossed
just
lift
the
upper
one
and
put
it
down
beside
the
other
again
while
running
it
is
perfectly
easy
and
yet
i
have
known
people
who
after
weeks
of
practice
dared
not
lift
a
ski
off
the
ground
while
moving
only
because
they
had
never
tried
it
as
routine
practice
whatever
you
do
by
way
of
practice
do
it
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
or
you
will
become
a
right
or
and
it
will
take
ages
for
you
to
feel
equal
confidence
in
either
foot
this
applies
especially
to
turns
beginners
will
often
go
on
practising
a
turn
on
the
right
foot
till
they
can
do
it
and
then
have
to
it
completely
on
the
left
foot
straight
running
downhill
is
mainly
a
question
of
confidence
and
balance
as
said
before
it
is
better
at
first
to
avoid
straight
running
down
a
steep
slope
because
the
skis
may
go
so
fast
that
the
beginner
is
quite
incapable
of
keeping
up
with
them
and
a
fall
at
very
high
speed
is
somewhat
upsetting
and
may
temporarily
shake
your
nerve
choose
a
low
gradient
of
about
or
where
you
can
see
the
which
should
be
on
to
level
ground
or
even
a
gentle
rise
so
that
the
skis
gradually
pull
up
of
their
own
accord
soft
snow
is
the
easiest
and
confidence
may
soon
be
won
in
this
stand
upright
or
bend
the
knees
but
do
not
bend
at
the
waist
you
should
feel
as
though
on
springs
and
you
want
your
weight
should
be
well
forward
over
your
feet
so
that
you
can
keep
up
with
the
skis
standing
in
tube
or
bus
facing
the
way
you
are
going
and
not
holding
on
to
anything
is
very
good
practice
at
home
you
will
notice
that
a
bus
conductor
usually
gives
with
the
movement
of
the
bus
so
that
he
is
prepared
for
whatever
it
does
so
with
look
ahead
and
see
what
the
ground
is
like
and
then
suit
your
balance
to
what
is
likely
to
occur
as
the
ground
rises
or
falls
this
soon
becomes
automatic
but
it
needs
thinking
out
at
first
when
the
snow
is
hard
practise
side
slipping
because
it
will
help
you
out
of
many
difficulties
and
once
you
know
the
feeling
of
it
you
will
find
that
it
replaces
the
downhill
which
is
so
slow
on
hard
snow
it
is
possible
to
go
down
broadside
on
by
merely
standing
on
one
skis
and
turning
one
outer
or
lower
ankle
outwards
and
one
inner
or
upper
ankle
towards
the
other
so
that
the
skis
are
lying
flat
on
the
snow
instead
of
the
edges
biting
into
it
push
off
with
your
stick
from
the
slope
above
you
and
weight
your
heels
or
your
toes
according
to
whether
the
skis
are
sinking
in
front
or
behind
have
confidence
keep
upright
lean
away
from
the
slopes
and
let
your
skis
slide
and
do
blame
me
if
you
suddenly
slide
into
a
soft
patch
of
snow
which
stops
the
skis
dead
and
you
fall
head
downwards
this
is
all
in
the
day
work
if
the
surface
of
the
snow
is
uniformly
hard
you
will
slip
down
without
difficulty
seriously
side
slipping
is
a
huge
help
and
should
be
learned
at
once
caulfield
gives
instructions
which
are
easy
to
follow
in
detail
when
going
uphill
never
try
to
climb
steeper
than
is
easy
if
the
skis
are
slipping
back
you
are
going
too
steep
and
should
turn
off
and
traverse
instead
no
time
is
saved
by
too
steep
a
climb
the
man
who
goes
easily
gets
to
the
top
first
while
the
other
clambers
up
almost
on
all
fours
gets
hot
and
exhausted
and
has
gained
nothing
if
i
am
leading
an
elementary
run
uphill
i
can
soon
pick
out
the
experienced
runners
by
the
line
they
take
and
the
pace
at
which
they
climb
the
puffing
panting
stumbling
people
who
forge
ahead
or
turning
their
ankles
over
their
skis
so
as
to
get
a
grip
with
their
boots
are
not
included
in
my
experienced
runners
another
hint
for
uphill
work
is
that
when
traversing
a
slope
the
skis
should
be
edged
so
that
the
inner
edge
of
the
ski
bites
into
the
slope
a
ski
with
its
whole
surface
flattened
to
the
slope
is
bound
to
slip
especially
on
hard
snow
by
standing
upright
as
you
go
uphill
and
keeping
the
ankles
straight
the
skis
will
be
edged
in
the
right
way
a
quick
way
of
getting
up
a
steep
slope
is
as
you
stand
with
your
skis
horizontal
across
the
slope
lift
the
upper
foot
and
place
it
on
the
slope
a
few
inches
higher
then
lift
the
lower
foot
and
place
it
beside
the
upper
you
will
soon
be
able
to
do
this
while
advancing
across
your
traverse
at
the
same
time
but
it
is
hard
work
and
should
only
be
used
for
short
climbs
is
a
very
good
way
of
climbing
but
should
be
avoided
when
descending
except
when
approaching
a
narrow
gap
in
a
fence
or
crossing
a
stream
where
the
approach
is
steep
i
have
known
a
party
almost
benighted
by
a
beginner
who
had
discovered
the
joys
of
and
proposed
to
descend
some
feet
by
this
safe
method
instead
of
sliding
in
the
proper
way
allowing
eight
inches
to
each
how
many
hours
would
it
take
to
descend
feet
a
further
hint
which
may
be
useful
for
uphill
work
if
the
skis
are
slightly
lifted
at
every
push
forward
they
tend
to
stick
instead
of
sliding
back
always
stand
upright
when
climbing
and
keep
the
weight
well
on
the
heels
people
tend
to
bend
forward
and
this
adds
greatly
to
the
effort
and
the
skis
are
more
likely
to
slip
back
on
long
climbs
sealskins
are
usually
used
on
the
skis
the
hairs
lying
towards
the
rear
stick
into
the
snow
and
prevent
the
back
slip
while
when
the
ski
pushes
forward
they
lie
flat
and
offer
no
resistance
the
best
uphill
track
is
the
one
which
keeps
going
at
the
same
angle
every
good
walker
knows
how
tiring
it
is
to
go
up
and
down
across
country
when
gullies
have
to
be
crossed
it
is
disappointing
having
got
up
a
certain
height
to
lose
all
that
is
gained
by
going
down
again
so
it
is
even
more
with
when
uphill
work
is
really
more
arduous
than
walking
caulfield
gives
a
very
helpful
description
of
a
good
uphill
track
and
skis
tend
to
teach
the
beginner
how
to
keep
the
angle
as
they
slip
so
easily
downwards
the
moment
the
uphill
direction
is
altered
when
going
uphill
make
up
your
mind
what
point
you
want
to
reach
in
the
distance
and
what
line
will
take
you
to
it
most
easily
and
then
go
for
it
steadily
keeping
the
same
angle
all
the
way
so
far
as
is
possible
and
choosing
your
places
for
turns
very
carefully
before
you
reach
them
following
an
experienced
leader
teaches
a
great
deal
about
the
art
of
setting
an
uphill
track
and
the
criticisms
of
the
rest
of
the
party
following
when
the
leader
loses
height
soon
make
one
want
to
avoid
comment
etiquette
in
organized
centres
a
perfectly
good
code
of
etiquette
is
growing
up
as
the
result
of
experience
so
many
novices
pour
out
on
to
the
slopes
with
no
knowledge
of
the
game
that
notices
are
even
posted
on
the
boards
in
the
hotels
giving
a
few
of
the
main
points
of
the
law
one
such
notice
runs
as
follows
ensure
that
you
take
your
own
skis
sticks
etc
when
you
start
out
it
is
wise
to
mark
sticks
and
they
are
safest
kept
in
bedrooms
never
join
a
private
party
unless
invited
only
join
the
advertised
tours
the
test
for
which
you
have
passed
the
slower
mover
has
the
right
of
way
the
faster
mover
must
avoid
him
never
call
fore
achtung
etc
always
offer
help
to
anyone
in
difficulties
keep
with
your
party
they
might
waste
a
lot
of
time
looking
for
you
while
you
run
home
because
you
thought
their
pace
too
slow
never
desert
a
runner
who
for
any
reason
is
unable
to
keep
up
with
a
party
carry
your
own
gear
including
spare
clothing
necessaries
etc
avoid
stepping
on
the
skis
of
another
runner
this
caution
is
especially
necessary
for
uphill
work
remember
that
wherever
you
leave
a
track
others
may
follow
therefore
only
choose
safe
slopes
the
snow
is
liable
to
slip
on
slopes
of
or
more
so
that
these
are
dangerous
is
a
sport
which
can
be
made
dangerous
for
others
if
individuals
do
not
carry
out
the
usual
etiquette
it
may
seem
extraordinary
that
people
should
need
warning
not
to
join
a
private
party
unless
invited
but
it
is
sadly
true
one
day
as
i
was
starting
off
on
a
long
run
a
stranger
came
up
to
me
and
asked
if
she
might
join
us
i
consulted
the
guide
and
he
said
he
already
had
as
many
in
the
party
as
he
could
take
charge
of
i
told
the
lady
this
and
said
i
was
sorry
that
we
could
not
accept
her
companionship
she
at
once
replied
cheerily
oh
then
i
will
follow
you
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
doing
this
switzerland
is
a
free
country
and
there
is
a
right
of
way
anywhere
over
the
mountains
in
winter
we
started
off
and
she
followed
from
that
moment
of
course
we
automatically
became
responsible
for
her
because
one
of
the
laws
is
that
you
never
desert
a
runner
who
is
alone
she
was
a
very
poor
performer
and
fell
a
great
deal
so
that
for
the
whole
six
or
seven
miles
run
we
were
kept
waiting
for
her
of
course
we
were
under
no
real
obligation
to
look
after
her
but
had
we
left
her
and
anything
had
happened
to
her
we
could
never
again
have
held
up
our
heads
as
on
another
occasion
a
runner
made
a
formal
complaint
to
me
about
a
lady
who
joined
his
party
in
this
case
it
was
an
experienced
runner
who
had
presumably
learnt
the
law
and
who
might
have
read
the
notice
on
the
board
first
of
all
she
said
may
i
go
with
you
and
the
somewhat
cold
answer
was
that
the
party
was
complete
then
she
followed
asking
questions
about
the
route
etc
at
every
opportunity
of
course
she
had
finally
to
be
adopted
and
taken
along
much
to
the
boredom
of
the
party
which
was
a
private
one
where
the
is
organized
tests
are
run
and
tours
arranged
for
the
different
standards
this
does
not
apply
so
much
to
or
runners
who
of
course
prefer
to
make
up
their
own
parties
but
at
any
rate
these
are
protected
from
having
the
less
experienced
runner
with
them
except
by
invitation
by
these
means
the
organized
tours
only
take
runners
up
to
the
standard
advertised
and
no
one
need
feel
compunction
at
leaving
members
of
their
party
behind
in
the
village
because
they
know
that
the
elementary
runner
will
also
get
a
chance
of
a
run
yet
even
under
these
arrangements
i
have
found
a
beginner
sitting
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
when
we
have
started
before
dawn
for
a
big
tour
where
are
you
off
to
i
said
thinking
he
was
out
with
a
guide
with
your
party
was
the
reply
what
could
i
do
it
is
not
easy
to
turn
a
person
out
of
a
train
at
on
a
cold
morning
i
said
weakly
did
you
not
see
the
notice
which
said
this
was
a
run
for
runners
only
he
said
yes
but
i
thought
i
could
keep
up
so
there
he
was
and
we
took
him
through
and
though
he
was
very
slow
uphill
and
kept
us
all
back
in
this
case
he
ran
down
without
delaying
us
people
often
put
their
own
capacity
higher
than
do
the
people
they
want
to
run
with
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
be
tactful
again
most
people
would
not
think
it
necessary
to
warn
runners
against
deserting
their
party
yet
they
often
do
and
it
is
not
usually
the
beginner
who
is
the
culprit
here
perhaps
he
can
not
run
quick
enough
to
get
away
i
shall
always
remember
a
run
in
charge
of
a
tour
when
i
was
with
a
lot
of
novices
another
experienced
runner
accompanied
me
officially
to
help
i
chose
what
i
thought
the
easiest
way
to
start
and
he
wanted
to
try
another
route
at
the
top
and
went
off
saying
he
would
join
us
below
a
wood
when
we
reached
the
part
where
i
thought
we
should
rejoin
i
waited
and
shouted
but
he
did
not
appear
so
we
went
on
to
another
post
where
we
had
lunch
and
then
i
began
to
get
anxious
as
this
runner
never
turned
up
anything
might
have
happened
to
him
he
might
have
gone
over
a
rock
or
into
a
tree
or
even
only
be
tied
up
in
one
of
those
tangled
falls
when
it
is
practically
impossible
to
extricate
oneself
it
was
no
good
our
trying
to
look
for
him
then
so
after
about
two
hours
delay
i
took
my
party
down
to
the
valley
and
the
first
person
who
met
us
in
the
village
was
our
lost
companion
he
chaffed
us
for
being
so
late
as
he
had
run
down
very
quickly
and
had
had
his
tea
ages
ago
no
party
going
beyond
the
nursery
slopes
should
consist
of
fewer
than
three
one
to
go
for
help
in
case
of
need
the
other
to
stay
with
the
third
runner
who
may
need
help
needless
to
say
people
who
know
the
mountains
well
go
off
alone
with
impunity
when
i
asked
one
of
these
lonely
runners
what
would
happen
if
he
hurt
himself
and
was
benighted
he
told
me
he
always
carried
sufficient
morphia
to
put
him
out
of
his
agony
in
case
of
need
this
was
no
doubt
all
right
from
his
point
of
view
but
what
of
the
people
who
might
go
out
to
look
for
him
among
the
infinite
possible
runs
with
ski
tracks
in
every
direction
no
sporting
runner
would
ever
refuse
help
to
a
lame
duck
though
pretty
bad
cases
of
selfishness
have
been
recorded
there
is
one
point
which
does
not
always
strike
people
and
that
is
the
danger
of
cutting
a
track
over
a
difficult
place
beginners
will
usually
follow
a
track
instead
of
working
by
their
map
for
instance
on
the
muottas
muraigl
run
at
pontresina
if
once
a
rash
runner
cuts
a
track
straight
across
from
the
restaurant
to
the
valley
crowds
will
probably
follow
it
though
they
may
be
warned
against
it
this
is
a
very
dangerous
slope
under
certain
conditions
as
was
shown
this
winter
when
a
runner
going
along
its
top
was
carried
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
by
the
avalanche
he
started
i
have
one
track
left
on
my
conscience
when
a
few
of
us
went
down
what
might
have
been
a
dangerous
place
under
different
conditions
to
those
we
found
luckily
it
was
not
a
way
most
people
would
have
wished
to
follow
as
it
apparently
led
nowhere
and
hardly
looked
attractive
the
slower
mover
always
has
the
right
of
way
when
so
that
no
runner
ought
to
shout
to
those
ahead
of
him
to
get
out
of
his
way
needless
to
say
this
does
not
apply
to
a
runner
out
of
control
who
may
be
dashing
unwillingly
into
someone
in
front
of
him
when
for
both
their
sakes
a
friendly
warning
is
advisable
it
is
the
business
of
every
to
avoid
obstacles
and
the
slower
mover
may
be
looked
on
as
such
in
just
the
same
way
as
a
rock
or
a
tree
i
was
amused
one
day
at
pontresina
when
a
crowd
of
us
were
going
up
the
village
street
and
met
a
lady
on
skis
being
held
back
as
she
went
downhill
by
two
friends
on
either
side
of
her
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
thought
of
someone
going
down
hill
being
the
slower
mover
in
relation
to
those
climbing
nursery
slopes
are
for
the
practice
of
turns
and
the
individual
who
uses
them
for
straight
running
while
a
lot
of
people
are
practising
is
abhorred
the
same
applies
to
jumps
on
the
nursery
slopes
these
are
so
easily
made
where
other
people
are
not
practising
that
it
is
selfish
to
come
plunging
down
into
a
crowd
of
devotees
to
turns
when
the
nursery
slopes
are
empty
it
is
great
fun
to
practise
straight
running
down
them
and
no
one
will
object
one
jolly
thing
about
ski
runners
is
that
they
seldom
ridicule
one
another
or
laugh
at
falls
in
any
but
a
friendly
way
there
is
great
rivalry
and
daring
to
greater
effort
but
ridicule
is
seldom
heard
perhaps
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
most
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
do
not
throw
stones
everybody
who
tries
to
improve
his
is
bound
to
fall
and
it
is
better
not
to
set
the
fashion
of
laughing
at
others
in
difficulties
there
will
always
be
some
people
who
like
to
look
on
at
tests
as
free
entertainment
without
tax
but
if
they
could
hear
the
comments
on
their
behaviour
and
probably
on
their
own
lack
of
prowess
they
would
soon
give
up
the
habit
anyone
who
is
really
keen
to
get
on
and
who
will
go
on
practising
and
accept
advice
may
be
sure
of
sympathy
and
help
with
all
its
dangers
and
need
for
combined
effort
seems
to
bring
out
the
best
of
people
and
to
produce
the
very
best
spirit
of
goodwill
and
tolerance
going
uphill
in
soft
snow
every
strong
member
should
take
a
turn
at
cutting
the
track
it
is
often
heavy
work
and
an
energetic
leader
may
not
like
to
ask
for
help
the
best
plan
is
to
work
by
time
the
leader
falling
out
at
the
end
of
his
shift
and
letting
the
party
pass
him
till
he
takes
his
position
at
the
rear
and
the
second
man
becomes
the
leader
and
so
on
people
who
are
wise
will
avoid
stepping
on
the
skis
of
the
man
ahead
this
is
often
difficult
as
instinct
makes
one
want
to
go
faster
than
the
person
ahead
just
as
a
wheeler
in
a
tandem
will
usually
try
to
catch
up
the
leader
the
easiest
way
to
avoid
overlapping
is
to
keep
step
push
forward
the
right
foot
when
the
man
ahead
pushes
forward
his
right
foot
and
then
the
left
this
gives
a
rhythm
to
the
uphill
work
which
also
seems
to
minimize
effort
anyone
who
has
experienced
the
irritation
caused
by
his
skis
being
constantly
touched
by
the
runner
behind
while
plodding
uphill
will
learn
to
spare
another
the
same
nuisance
when
running
straight
down
a
steep
slope
make
sure
that
there
is
no
one
ahead
whom
you
might
run
into
and
no
one
below
on
either
side
who
might
traverse
across
the
slope
you
propose
to
run
down
this
is
especially
necessary
in
a
gap
between
trees
another
member
of
your
party
might
be
among
the
trees
below
and
suddenly
come
out
into
the
open
traversing
to
the
other
side
when
straight
running
at
any
speed
only
the
best
ski
runners
can
turn
suddenly
to
avoid
a
difficulty
and
a
nasty
collision
may
occur
if
care
be
not
exercised
when
a
crowd
of
people
are
taking
their
skis
by
train
a
great
deal
of
trouble
may
be
avoided
in
getting
the
mass
of
skis
out
of
the
train
if
these
are
tied
neatly
together
a
pair
of
skis
tied
near
the
tips
and
behind
the
bindings
is
easy
to
handle
while
a
pair
of
skis
put
together
by
slipping
one
through
the
of
the
other
is
a
great
nuisance
skis
piled
together
soon
become
very
like
a
heap
of
spillikins
if
not
carefully
handled
and
a
good
deal
of
damage
may
be
done
to
them
as
well
as
delay
to
the
train
if
are
careless
in
this
small
matter
another
good
plan
is
for
the
to
form
themselves
into
a
queue
and
to
hand
out
all
the
skis
along
the
line
till
they
can
be
easily
distributed
where
there
is
space
the
beginner
is
apt
to
hunt
anxiously
for
his
own
pair
which
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile
and
while
he
pulls
and
tugs
with
but
little
success
other
people
are
waiting
in
vain
for
a
chance
to
get
their
skis
out
this
is
especially
the
case
on
funicular
railways
where
space
is
very
limited
in
the
stations
different
nationalities
travelling
together
add
considerably
to
the
confusion
and
the
railway
officials
are
usually
thankful
to
anyone
who
will
take
charge
and
get
a
line
formed
and
the
skis
handed
out
tidily
these
hints
may
seem
unnecessary
to
a
great
many
people
but
no
matter
i
have
had
so
much
of
my
own
time
wasted
by
this
sort
of
tiresome
lack
of
sense
that
i
venture
to
suggest
a
means
of
saving
time
and
temper
for
others
ski
runners
should
remember
that
sledges
and
pedestrians
have
the
right
of
way
on
a
road
all
the
fields
are
open
to
the
ski
runner
and
he
should
not
monopolize
a
road
in
most
parts
of
switzerland
there
is
a
law
by
which
everyone
has
right
of
way
everywhere
where
the
snow
lies
so
long
as
it
is
not
enclosed
ground
this
was
brought
home
to
my
family
rather
vividly
when
we
lived
at
davos
by
a
shooting
gallery
being
set
up
on
our
land
in
front
of
our
house
we
had
no
power
to
prevent
it
and
there
it
remained
for
the
winter
at
the
same
time
ski
runners
should
respect
the
property
of
other
people
and
here
i
would
like
to
make
two
appeals
to
british
runners
firstly
that
we
will
do
our
best
to
avoid
damaging
young
trees
old
trees
can
probably
look
after
themselves
where
the
is
concerned
as
they
are
usually
stronger
than
he
is
secondly
that
we
should
treat
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
with
as
much
courtesy
as
possible
the
peasant
over
whose
land
we
run
makes
very
little
out
of
the
tourist
business
and
has
other
things
to
think
about
rather
than
sport
he
is
usually
courteous
and
friendly
and
always
ready
to
help
us
when
in
difficulties
let
us
return
his
hospitality
be
treating
him
with
courtesy
school
teachers
have
told
me
that
they
have
great
difficulty
in
persuading
the
children
to
greet
foreigners
because
these
so
seldom
respond
yet
few
things
are
more
pleasant
than
the
friendly
grüsse
or
grüss
gott
or
leb
wohl
with
which
one
is
greeted
by
the
people
of
the
country
we
can
answer
in
english
if
we
do
not
know
how
to
answer
in
german
but
do
let
us
answer
and
thereby
prove
ourselves
as
friendly
as
our
hosts
another
matter
which
is
not
always
understood
by
beginners
on
the
snow
fields
is
that
when
an
alpine
club
or
local
ski
club
hut
is
used
a
fee
should
be
paid
to
the
funds
which
support
the
hut
these
huts
are
expensive
to
build
and
their
upkeep
is
a
great
tax
on
the
clubs
british
runners
can
either
join
the
local
club
when
they
can
use
the
huts
by
day
for
nothing
or
they
can
pay
the
advertised
fee
for
whatever
use
they
make
of
them
a
notice
is
always
posted
in
the
hut
showing
the
various
charges
but
when
no
one
is
there
to
collect
the
money
it
is
left
to
the
honour
of
the
guests
to
pay
it
a
can
be
found
in
all
huts
within
switzerland
proper
but
as
these
boxes
are
not
safe
from
marauders
near
the
frontier
the
ski
runner
has
to
send
the
money
in
by
post
at
the
boval
hut
for
instance
above
the
morteratsch
glacier
a
supply
of
money
order
forms
will
be
found
hanging
near
a
door
all
the
leader
of
the
party
has
to
do
is
to
collect
the
money
from
his
members
take
one
of
the
forms
and
pay
the
money
into
any
post
office
whence
it
is
sent
to
the
of
the
club
huts
should
invariably
be
left
tidy
this
also
is
a
matter
of
honour
the
doors
are
unlocked
always
in
order
that
people
who
may
need
hospitality
in
case
of
distress
can
find
shelter
blankets
can
be
borrowed
wood
is
usually
provided
for
firing
and
there
may
even
be
a
reserve
of
food
all
of
which
should
be
respected
before
the
party
leaves
blankets
should
be
folded
shutters
should
be
shut
snow
swept
out
and
debris
buried
outside
or
what
can
be
used
as
fuel
put
away
tidily
in
the
kitchen
then
the
door
should
be
shut
carefully
and
the
hut
left
the
better
rather
than
the
worse
off
for
having
given
hospitality
snow
and
light
full
descriptions
of
the
different
types
of
snow
which
must
be
negotiated
by
the
will
be
found
in
arnold
lunn
book
alpine
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
therefore
to
describe
the
four
main
types
namely
soft
hard
crust
and
sticky
snow
soft
snow
in
winter
is
the
new
powder
snow
which
is
to
be
found
after
a
fall
or
on
north
slopes
where
sun
and
wind
have
not
spoilt
it
it
is
the
ideal
snow
for
the
luxurious
runner
especially
two
days
after
it
has
fallen
when
it
has
settled
down
and
a
hard
frost
has
converted
it
into
crystal
powder
a
run
through
crystallized
snow
which
tinkles
as
the
skis
cut
through
it
is
beyond
description
even
a
bad
runner
will
find
that
he
can
do
marvels
as
the
snow
seems
literally
to
help
him
in
all
his
experiments
i
have
known
a
day
when
a
blinding
blizzard
has
started
blowing
the
snow
into
my
face
and
i
have
run
fast
along
the
bottom
of
a
valley
with
my
eyes
shut
the
skis
kept
to
the
lowest
line
and
ran
safely
and
steadily
through
this
powder
snow
at
a
low
gradient
it
is
not
suggested
that
blind
running
should
be
indulged
in
as
a
rule
and
i
only
quote
this
case
to
show
how
helpful
is
good
powder
snow
the
telemark
is
the
usual
turn
in
soft
snow
christiania
and
jump
turns
can
also
be
used
by
people
who
are
proficient
and
strong
but
they
require
both
skill
and
strength
soft
snow
is
usually
found
on
north
slopes
or
at
the
bottom
of
shady
valleys
or
even
behind
any
ridge
which
protects
it
from
the
sun
or
wind
also
among
trees
which
shelter
it
tracks
ruin
it
in
time
so
that
it
is
usually
wise
to
sidle
off
the
track
and
try
new
snow
beside
it
luckily
for
the
experienced
runner
most
beginners
usually
behave
rather
like
sheep
preferring
tracks
to
exploring
on
their
own
the
result
is
that
perfect
snow
can
often
be
found
alongside
the
beaten
track
and
when
this
gets
spoilt
it
is
only
necessary
to
go
a
little
further
afield
in
order
to
get
a
good
run
then
as
more
and
more
people
beat
down
the
track
it
becomes
hard
and
very
amusing
running
can
be
had
there
hard
snow
is
of
two
types
a
beaten
track
or
a
hard
crust
where
the
sun
has
melted
the
surface
and
the
frost
at
night
has
frozen
it
so
that
it
will
bear
the
weight
of
the
when
this
is
really
solid
enough
to
allow
of
and
stem
or
christiania
turns
it
is
very
trustworthy
and
easy
to
negotiate
at
first
however
it
intimidates
the
beginner
because
it
is
very
fast
as
time
goes
on
and
he
becomes
accustomed
to
the
skid
and
rattle
of
hard
snow
he
will
find
that
his
horror
turns
into
pleasure
because
he
can
trust
it
the
nursery
slopes
become
hard
after
two
or
three
days
and
will
provide
useful
experience
for
coping
with
such
snow
on
a
run
the
lifted
stem
and
christiania
are
the
best
turns
on
hard
snow
a
telemark
is
apt
to
skid
too
much
crust
is
the
bugbear
of
all
runners
and
is
out
and
away
the
most
difficult
to
tackle
it
may
be
hard
and
then
with
nothing
apparent
on
the
surface
to
warn
you
the
skis
break
through
and
catch
in
the
crust
and
down
you
go
when
crust
is
about
let
someone
else
lead
and
then
profit
by
his
experience
there
are
many
forms
of
crust
all
of
which
may
be
met
on
the
same
run
and
when
wind
has
been
at
work
there
may
be
crust
on
north
slopes
and
not
on
south
after
rain
too
when
the
surface
has
been
soaked
and
a
frost
follows
crust
will
be
found
everywhere
sticky
snow
is
usually
due
to
the
effect
of
the
sun
or
to
fohn
wind
or
thaw
it
is
easily
coped
with
by
proper
waxing
of
the
running
surfaces
but
the
sudden
sticking
of
the
skis
which
have
been
running
well
over
wet
snow
in
the
open
when
they
get
into
cold
powder
snow
under
trees
or
in
shadow
is
very
disconcerting
the
same
is
apt
to
happen
when
people
have
dried
their
skis
in
the
sun
by
sticking
them
on
end
while
lunching
the
sun
not
only
dries
them
but
warms
them
so
that
if
the
first
run
after
lunch
is
in
shadow
and
the
snow
is
cold
the
skis
stick
because
the
warm
surfaces
melt
the
snow
which
immediately
freezes
again
and
adheres
to
the
skis
so
that
they
come
to
an
absolute
standstill
the
only
way
to
avoid
sticking
is
to
keep
the
running
surfaces
of
the
skis
in
good
condition
by
oiling
them
thoroughly
and
to
carry
one
or
two
different
types
of
wax
for
use
according
to
circumstances
the
great
thing
is
to
get
practice
on
all
types
of
snow
and
never
to
mind
it
look
upon
crust
as
a
joke
and
learn
jump
turns
which
are
the
only
safe
turns
for
any
but
the
strongest
runners
some
of
these
can
accomplish
a
telemark
or
or
even
a
christiania
on
every
sort
of
snow
but
most
people
are
content
with
the
jump
turn
on
crust
the
great
trouble
of
this
turn
is
that
it
is
very
tiring
when
a
heavy
rucksack
is
carried
but
knack
and
good
use
of
the
stick
will
help
it
light
is
a
great
factor
in
on
a
fine
day
when
visibility
is
good
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
between
the
rise
and
fall
of
country
ahead
and
therefore
to
be
prepared
for
decrease
or
increase
in
speed
some
days
when
the
sky
is
clouded
it
is
practically
impossible
to
tell
what
is
coming
this
difficulty
is
increased
in
a
narrow
valley
when
the
reflection
of
the
slopes
on
either
side
make
the
whole
surface
look
identical
coloured
glasses
may
help
a
little
but
it
is
better
to
run
slowly
and
to
take
no
risks
on
these
occasions
tracks
help
immensely
as
they
give
the
eye
something
to
follow
rocks
and
trees
also
help
anything
that
breaks
the
surface
of
the
snow
and
shows
up
the
gradient
ahead
falls
falls
what
a
word
when
i
first
thought
of
writing
this
book
it
struck
me
that
the
best
selling
title
would
be
without
falls
but
then
i
remembered
that
i
could
never
look
a
beginner
in
the
face
again
if
knowing
that
he
had
read
my
book
i
saw
him
fall
besides
which
a
ski
runner
who
never
falls
is
probably
but
a
poor
exponent
of
the
sport
when
you
begin
to
run
comfortably
and
can
do
the
turns
at
low
speeds
falls
show
that
you
are
still
trying
to
learn
more
of
the
game
it
is
only
by
trying
new
things
that
a
runner
becomes
really
proficient
and
you
are
almost
certain
to
fall
constantly
as
you
learn
there
is
art
in
falling
on
skis
as
well
as
in
running
and
turning
fall
loose
let
yourself
go
never
try
to
save
yourself
when
once
you
find
the
fall
is
inevitable
and
get
rid
of
your
sticks
you
will
have
the
most
amazing
falls
on
skis
and
nobody
will
listen
to
your
descriptions
of
them
because
they
are
just
as
eager
to
describe
their
own
the
surprising
thing
is
how
little
people
hurt
themselves
knees
and
ankles
go
most
the
strain
on
the
knee
and
ankle
is
very
great
in
some
falls
but
if
you
let
yourself
go
and
relax
your
muscles
as
you
fall
you
will
find
that
even
ankles
and
knees
survive
as
a
rule
i
once
saw
a
really
good
runner
turn
three
somersaults
while
down
a
steep
slope
at
high
speed
in
soft
snow
and
all
the
damage
done
was
two
snapped
moral
do
wear
people
are
so
tangled
up
sometimes
that
they
do
not
know
whether
the
ski
tip
sticking
out
of
the
snow
belongs
to
their
right
or
left
foot
and
they
have
to
dig
with
their
sticks
before
they
can
extricate
themselves
and
sometimes
the
results
of
a
fall
are
so
intricate
that
the
runner
could
never
extricate
himself
but
needs
the
help
of
a
friend
who
will
undo
a
binding
so
as
to
free
him
the
most
curious
fall
i
ever
saw
was
when
a
man
running
down
a
steep
slope
among
trees
ran
into
a
fir
tree
on
the
upper
side
where
the
snow
was
lying
well
up
the
trunk
he
then
fell
head
downwards
into
the
hole
below
the
tree
where
the
snow
had
not
penetrated
and
his
skis
being
caught
in
the
branches
there
he
hung
had
he
been
alone
i
doubt
whether
he
would
ever
have
succeeded
in
getting
free
as
it
was
we
undid
a
binding
quickly
and
no
damage
was
done
not
only
is
there
art
in
falling
but
there
is
a
technique
of
getting
up
before
attempting
to
get
up
arrange
your
skis
so
that
they
are
ready
to
stand
on
suppose
they
are
crossed
below
you
on
a
steep
slope
lie
on
the
slope
raise
the
skis
in
the
air
uncross
them
set
them
parallel
across
the
slope
below
you
facing
the
way
you
want
to
go
and
get
up
this
fall
is
sometimes
used
as
a
turn
and
may
be
very
useful
though
not
considered
the
best
possible
form
if
done
intentionally
never
attempt
to
get
up
on
to
skis
facing
downhill
they
will
only
go
off
with
you
the
moment
you
begin
to
rise
and
then
down
you
flop
again
if
you
fall
head
downwards
down
a
slope
you
still
have
to
get
your
skis
parallel
across
the
slope
below
you
before
you
can
stand
up
and
the
only
thing
to
be
done
is
to
turn
a
somersault
uncrossing
your
skis
in
the
air
if
they
are
crossed
and
getting
them
below
you
and
then
standing
up
all
of
which
is
extremely
easy
but
it
is
very
necessary
to
ensure
that
clothes
are
so
made
that
the
powder
snow
can
not
slip
into
crevices
while
you
are
gambolling
in
this
fashion
the
first
thing
i
do
before
getting
up
from
a
fall
is
to
put
up
my
hands
and
let
the
snow
shake
out
of
my
glove
gauntlets
if
you
are
so
tangled
up
in
a
fall
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
out
just
undo
a
binding
slip
off
a
ski
and
get
up
easily
with
a
free
foot
to
stand
on
and
if
you
see
anyone
else
so
tangled
up
that
he
does
not
begin
to
get
up
immediately
hurry
to
his
assistance
because
his
ankle
or
knee
may
be
in
a
very
strained
position
and
he
may
be
thankful
to
you
for
undoing
a
binding
and
releasing
him
it
is
in
these
falls
that
the
leather
heel
bindings
so
often
prove
better
than
a
rigid
toe
binding
the
leather
will
ease
a
little
or
slip
and
allow
the
foot
to
turn
a
fraction
of
an
inch
so
that
the
strain
is
not
maintained
long
enough
to
cause
real
damage
falls
are
often
half
the
fun
of
and
every
runner
who
is
trying
something
new
will
sometimes
fall
in
the
endeavour
so
never
lose
hope
however
much
you
fall
if
you
have
been
running
rather
well
and
then
get
a
day
when
you
do
nothing
but
only
means
that
you
are
stale
and
that
your
muscles
and
nerves
need
a
rest
this
is
where
the
winter
sportsman
gains
he
can
spend
a
day
on
the
rink
or
curling
or
tobogganing
and
not
feel
that
he
has
wasted
time
never
scoff
at
people
because
they
fall
a
runner
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
run
at
high
speed
using
turns
without
falling
so
he
will
probably
if
he
intends
to
but
no
runner
worth
his
salt
would
always
run
like
this
he
will
always
be
trying
something
more
difficult
turns
at
higher
speed
or
in
difficult
snow
and
consequently
he
will
often
be
seen
to
fall
and
the
beginner
who
scoffs
is
merely
voted
an
ignoramus
here
again
a
runner
will
be
judged
by
his
tracks
look
carefully
at
the
place
where
he
ran
and
try
to
make
out
what
turn
he
was
trying
and
what
the
snow
was
like
and
why
he
fell
you
can
learn
a
great
deal
from
other
people
tracks
falls
in
deep
snow
are
always
a
little
more
risky
than
on
hard
snow
because
there
is
greater
strain
on
muscles
and
ligaments
on
hard
snow
you
get
many
a
bump
and
scratch
but
the
results
are
less
lasting
than
a
torn
ligament
having
got
up
safely
from
your
fall
look
on
the
snow
and
see
what
you
have
dropped
before
starting
off
again
even
pockets
with
flaps
may
allow
of
leakage
it
is
wise
to
tie
your
rucksack
firmly
with
a
strap
round
your
waist
because
if
it
is
loose
anything
heavy
inside
may
give
you
a
nasty
bump
on
the
head
as
you
fall
tests
there
are
three
british
ski
tests
under
the
federal
council
of
british
ski
clubs
in
addition
to
these
different
centres
and
local
clubs
often
set
an
elementary
test
for
beginners
in
order
that
these
may
be
sorted
into
various
standards
for
expeditions
hitherto
the
elementary
test
has
usually
been
a
run
down
a
certain
distance
within
a
time
set
by
the
judges
this
is
not
an
altogether
satisfactory
test
as
the
beginner
who
goes
straight
down
sitting
on
his
skis
may
get
through
while
another
who
conscientiously
tries
to
run
standing
falls
the
whole
time
and
fails
style
might
be
judged
and
the
sitting
candidate
disqualified
but
when
as
often
happens
some
seventy
or
eighty
people
enter
for
an
elementary
test
the
judges
have
their
hands
full
enough
with
starting
and
timing
apart
from
watching
individual
running
critically
as
in
the
test
a
better
way
therefore
is
to
flag
a
line
which
must
be
followed
providing
traverses
across
slopes
which
soon
catch
out
the
sitting
novice
beginners
usually
hate
traversing
because
they
dislike
the
look
of
a
steep
slope
and
do
not
know
how
to
prevent
the
instinctive
pointing
straight
downwards
of
the
skis
they
do
not
realize
yet
that
if
they
would
stand
upright
on
their
skis
while
traversing
and
lead
with
the
upper
foot
while
they
put
their
weight
on
the
lower
foot
and
keep
their
whole
weight
somewhat
on
their
heels
they
will
traverse
quite
easily
at
a
gentle
angle
the
elementary
test
ought
to
be
so
planned
as
to
force
this
type
of
running
another
way
of
running
an
elementary
test
is
for
a
judge
to
lead
at
a
steady
easy
pace
for
an
hour
run
including
both
up
and
downhill
as
well
as
level
running
and
obstacles
the
test
would
be
timed
an
ample
margin
being
allowed
beyond
the
judge
time
all
those
who
finished
within
the
time
would
pass
this
would
probably
not
be
nearly
so
popular
a
test
with
the
candidates
as
the
short
downhill
run
but
it
would
be
a
far
better
test
of
their
capacity
for
touring
the
british
ski
tests
consist
of
the
and
tests
the
regulations
for
which
will
be
found
in
the
ski
year
book
which
can
be
obtained
from
the
hon
secretary
federal
council
of
british
ski
clubs
essex
court
temple
london
they
can
also
be
obtained
from
any
official
representative
of
one
of
the
british
clubs
in
switzerland
and
are
printed
as
an
appendix
at
the
end
of
this
book
in
the
class
test
which
is
the
first
and
which
has
to
be
passed
before
the
runner
can
go
up
for
his
class
there
are
three
parts
part
a
is
a
climb
of
feet
in
not
more
than
hours
and
a
run
down
feet
in
a
time
set
by
the
judges
the
time
may
not
be
less
than
seven
or
more
than
twenty
minutes
it
should
not
be
more
than
minutes
under
good
conditions
men
must
carry
rucksacks
weighing
not
less
than
and
women
lbs
sealskins
may
be
used
for
the
climb
part
b
consists
of
four
consecutive
lifted
on
a
slope
of
to
and
part
c
four
consecutive
telemark
turns
on
a
slope
of
the
same
gradient
parts
b
and
c
are
often
used
as
a
qualifying
test
before
part
a
is
run
in
order
to
limit
the
entries
for
part
a
which
may
otherwise
be
a
very
difficult
test
to
run
when
a
large
field
enters
for
it
candidates
who
enter
for
this
test
should
really
take
pains
to
ensure
that
their
bindings
fit
their
boots
and
that
they
have
everything
necessary
for
a
run
as
well
as
being
up
to
the
standard
speaking
as
a
judge
of
four
years
standing
who
has
run
innumerable
tests
i
may
say
that
it
is
pitiable
to
see
the
number
of
casual
people
who
will
come
up
for
a
test
without
reading
the
regulations
and
without
being
in
any
way
prepared
for
a
climb
few
things
are
more
disagreeable
than
having
to
disqualify
a
candidate
who
turns
up
without
a
rucksack
or
more
miserable
than
having
to
shepherd
down
beginners
who
are
worn
out
by
a
run
for
which
they
are
quite
out
of
training
the
one
comfort
is
that
a
candidate
who
is
pertinacious
and
courageous
enough
to
face
this
test
five
or
six
times
without
passing
and
goes
in
again
is
almost
sure
to
pass
in
the
end
for
the
judge
sake
however
i
strongly
urge
such
a
candidate
to
time
himself
over
similar
runs
with
his
friends
and
to
persist
in
this
until
he
proves
that
he
is
up
to
standard
when
he
will
be
a
very
welcome
candidate
in
the
test
itself
a
course
is
easily
found
by
using
an
aneroid
or
it
may
also
be
worked
off
the
ordnance
map
any
ordinary
watch
with
a
second
hand
will
suffice
for
the
timing
of
one
own
run
some
people
may
think
that
i
am
a
little
harsh
in
my
reasons
for
suggesting
that
beginners
should
not
enter
for
the
running
part
of
the
test
so
lightheartedly
it
is
really
for
their
own
sakes
as
much
as
for
that
of
the
judge
failure
is
very
discouraging
and
i
have
known
people
nerve
quite
upset
by
one
of
these
runs
they
have
tried
to
race
down
and
have
taken
really
nasty
tosses
in
their
rush
while
the
fatigue
of
constant
falling
and
getting
up
out
of
deep
snow
becoming
more
and
more
out
of
breath
in
the
anxiety
to
compete
is
very
bad
for
their
running
i
have
often
wanted
to
hide
my
head
in
shame
when
coming
home
after
such
a
test
with
a
lot
of
people
wet
through
who
have
failed
and
yet
such
is
life
that
many
with
the
first
breath
after
they
finish
exhausted
will
ask
when
the
next
test
takes
place
in
order
that
they
may
compete
again
such
a
candidate
really
does
one
heart
good
tests
have
probably
done
more
than
anything
else
to
improve
the
standard
of
british
running
we
all
have
a
liking
for
competition
and
here
is
our
chance
having
succeeded
in
passing
the
test
we
can
wear
a
badge
and
then
we
have
to
ski
better
in
order
to
prove
worthy
of
it
and
presently
we
see
no
reason
against
qualifying
for
the
test
before
going
home
after
all
the
turns
only
have
to
be
done
on
a
steeper
slope
the
run
can
be
put
off
till
next
winter
and
passed
the
moment
we
come
out
they
say
the
standard
is
rising
higher
and
higher
as
british
ski
runners
become
more
proficient
the
runner
who
passed
a
year
or
two
ago
now
hesitates
to
wear
the
gold
badge
because
he
often
realizes
that
his
speed
and
turns
are
not
good
enough
for
what
is
now
required
judges
of
the
british
ski
tests
may
be
found
in
most
centres
but
as
there
are
very
few
people
the
tests
for
this
class
are
usually
run
in
one
or
two
districts
only
guides
and
ski
instructors
swiss
guides
are
certificated
by
the
swiss
alpine
club
and
are
the
only
people
permitted
by
law
to
guide
parties
among
the
higher
mountains
a
tariff
exists
in
every
district
showing
the
fees
which
these
guides
must
charge
in
addition
to
the
fee
the
client
usually
gives
a
gratuity
and
also
pays
for
the
guide
accommodation
and
provisions
on
the
tour
a
percentage
may
be
added
for
numbers
greater
than
those
provided
for
in
the
tariff
while
on
a
really
difficult
tour
the
guide
will
probably
refuse
to
take
more
than
two
or
three
runners
unless
a
second
guide
or
porter
be
engaged
the
certificated
guides
wear
a
badge
issued
by
the
swiss
alpine
club
and
any
man
wearing
this
may
be
depended
upon
to
be
a
good
fellow
a
careful
guide
and
a
philosopher
and
friend
most
of
them
can
now
ski
well
though
a
few
of
the
older
ones
may
not
be
very
proficient
in
technique
and
may
be
stick
riders
when
on
tour
with
a
guide
he
is
responsible
for
the
safety
of
the
party
and
every
member
should
do
his
best
to
help
him
by
carrying
out
any
instructions
he
may
give
for
their
greater
safety
this
is
not
always
appreciated
by
people
who
do
not
know
the
alps
and
their
unwritten
laws
and
the
guides
complain
somewhat
bitterly
that
they
are
often
put
in
very
difficult
positions
for
instance
on
one
occasion
when
a
party
was
crossing
an
avalanche
slope
the
guide
asked
them
to
go
singly
at
intervals
of
metres
so
that
if
anyone
was
carried
away
the
others
would
not
be
involved
and
could
go
to
his
rescue
one
of
the
party
was
overheard
saying
oh
he
is
only
trying
to
prove
how
careful
he
is
in
order
to
get
a
higher
tip
and
they
were
careless
in
their
carrying
out
of
the
instructions
in
any
case
it
is
discourteous
not
to
do
what
the
guide
prescribes
and
he
is
put
in
a
very
false
position
as
he
is
held
responsible
ski
instructors
belong
to
a
different
category
unless
they
are
also
certificated
guides
which
is
often
the
case
in
some
cantons
such
as
graubünden
the
instructors
have
to
pass
an
examination
showing
their
capacity
to
ski
and
also
to
teach
many
of
them
are
perfectly
beautiful
runners
but
they
should
not
be
pressed
to
conduct
tours
where
glacier
work
or
rock
climbing
is
involved
they
are
not
examined
for
this
and
they
hold
no
credentials
and
if
an
accident
occurs
everyone
is
blamed
there
are
a
great
many
other
runs
they
are
allowed
to
lead
and
they
will
set
as
good
a
course
as
anyone
would
wish
for
before
engaging
a
guide
or
an
instructor
on
the
recommendation
of
the
concierge
get
some
expert
advice
as
to
who
is
the
best
the
secretary
of
the
local
ski
club
would
advise
or
some
good
runner
in
the
neighbourhood
in
some
parts
of
switzerland
the
guides
and
instructors
have
taken
to
touting
for
clients
they
hang
about
the
hotels
and
try
to
induce
the
unwary
to
engage
them
and
to
go
for
tours
for
which
they
are
often
not
fit
the
better
swiss
guides
are
the
first
to
want
the
public
to
discourage
this
type
of
behaviour
as
it
is
doing
a
lot
of
harm
to
their
good
name
when
a
guide
is
engaged
treat
him
as
a
friend
and
trust
him
they
are
usually
a
most
obliging
and
reliable
set
of
men
who
will
do
everything
in
their
power
for
their
clients
such
as
carrying
food
and
spare
clothing
waxing
skis
attaching
skins
and
even
making
terms
in
inns
and
cooking
the
food
in
huts
when
on
tour
their
knowledge
of
the
mountains
and
their
experiences
are
well
worth
probing
and
they
will
usually
talk
willingly
when
kindly
dealt
with
they
are
quick
judges
of
character
and
if
the
younger
ones
are
sometimes
a
little
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
the
people
who
do
not
treat
them
suitably
only
those
people
themselves
can
be
blamed
the
guides
are
never
familiar
though
they
are
very
friendly
and
will
always
do
their
best
for
the
entertainment
of
their
party
they
should
not
be
petted
and
flattered
neither
should
they
be
treated
as
inferiors
a
happy
medium
is
easily
found
which
is
what
the
guide
will
prefer
because
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
has
the
whole
of
the
swiss
characteristics
great
dignity
independence
and
respect
for
wise
people
on
a
long
and
dangerous
tour
the
safety
of
the
party
may
ultimately
depend
upon
the
trust
and
confidence
placed
in
the
guide
in
charge
and
by
him
in
his
clients
and
this
should
be
remembered
in
all
negotiations
these
men
often
have
to
risk
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
the
people
who
employ
them
and
their
staunch
unselfishness
is
a
fine
example
of
human
endeavour
for
the
benefit
of
others
their
fees
may
appear
to
be
high
but
when
everything
is
taken
into
consideration
including
the
shortness
of
their
winter
and
summer
seasons
it
is
soon
realized
that
the
fees
are
not
exorbitant
maps
and
finding
the
way
every
ski
runner
going
across
country
should
carry
a
map
even
on
a
short
run
a
great
deal
can
be
learnt
from
a
map
which
will
prove
useful
later
on
a
longer
run
both
time
and
risk
can
be
saved
by
people
who
run
by
their
map
and
who
know
how
to
avoid
dangerous
places
and
how
to
take
advantage
of
narrow
safe
openings
there
are
different
types
of
maps
to
be
had
in
switzerland
the
best
are
the
official
ordnance
maps
published
by
the
eidg
landestopographie
at
bern
the
mountain
districts
are
produced
at
a
scale
of
centimetre
in
centimetres
or
centimetres
in
one
kilometre
and
large
or
small
sheets
can
be
bought
almost
everywhere
the
gradients
are
clearly
shown
by
contour
lines
the
equidistance
being
metres
or
roughly
feet
the
dotted
contour
lines
when
height
is
marked
some
every
or
ordinary
contour
lines
this
differs
according
to
the
edition
cliff
and
rock
are
shown
grey
while
glacier
contour
lines
are
blue
some
districts
such
as
the
bernese
oberland
have
produced
this
map
with
red
lines
showing
all
the
ski
runs
in
other
places
they
also
provide
maps
but
on
a
different
scale
and
not
as
good
as
the
ordnance
map
all
maps
are
best
when
mounted
on
linen
as
the
weathering
they
receive
on
a
run
may
reduce
a
paper
map
to
pulp
or
rag
it
is
easy
to
work
out
the
distance
of
runs
or
the
gradient
of
slopes
from
the
large
scale
ordnance
map
in
metres
means
that
centimetre
on
the
map
equals
a
run
of
metres
centimetres
equal
a
kilometre
or
metres
kilometres
equal
five
english
miles
therefore
if
a
centimetre
measure
be
carried
the
distances
are
soon
ascertained
with
a
minimum
of
arithmetic
throughout
this
chapter
i
have
taken
the
mathematical
or
map
gradient
and
not
the
engineer
gradient
the
latter
is
generally
used
i
understand
to
measure
the
gradients
of
roads
railways
etc
to
avoid
confusion
when
the
gradient
is
usually
named
by
the
angle
of
the
slope
the
gradient
of
slopes
is
shown
by
the
contour
lines
the
drop
between
each
being
metres
or
approximately
feet
the
table
on
was
got
out
by
commander
merriman
and
has
proved
very
useful
to
me
in
setting
tests
as
well
as
in
judging
whether
slopes
are
comparatively
safe
from
avalanche
or
not
a
slope
showing
eight
contour
lines
in
one
centimetre
works
out
roughly
at
which
is
a
steeper
slope
than
most
people
care
to
take
straight
running
over
unknown
country
anything
steeper
than
this
is
apt
to
avalanche
in
certain
conditions
though
a
slope
should
usually
be
safe
a
slope
may
be
dangerous
under
some
conditions
a
comfortable
slope
is
contour
lines
in
centimetre
or
a
gradient
of
taking
english
measurements
as
in
commander
merriman
scale
contour
lines
in
one
inch
on
the
map
the
beginner
will
probably
content
himself
with
slopes
where
contour
lines
are
shown
in
one
inch
or
a
gradient
of
about
rough
table
of
gradients
assuming
metre
contours
to
be
equal
to
feet
contours
actually
this
is
feet
natural
scale
drop
per
inch
average
angle
gradient
on
map
of
slope
in
up
till
now
i
have
only
been
describing
the
official
ordnance
maps
there
are
several
other
maps
which
may
also
be
useful
the
dufour
maps
are
good
for
direction
and
lie
of
country
but
their
scale
being
in
they
are
not
much
help
for
actual
running
the
local
ski
tour
map
is
useful
to
show
where
the
usual
tours
go
but
can
not
always
be
trusted
for
gradients
or
cliffs
and
rocks
the
pontresina
map
for
instance
though
showing
an
equidistance
of
metres
as
in
the
ordnance
maps
really
has
metres
contour
lines
which
might
be
a
terrible
snare
to
the
unwary
who
would
confidently
run
towards
a
slope
thinking
it
was
about
and
find
that
it
was
nearer
or
an
avalanche
slope
in
a
case
like
this
the
ordnance
map
must
be
used
for
actual
running
while
the
ski
tour
map
is
used
to
show
the
line
to
be
followed
in
some
districts
such
as
the
bernese
oberland
the
ordnance
map
has
been
used
for
the
local
ski
tour
map
and
the
tours
shown
on
it
in
red
this
is
a
great
saving
of
weight
and
money
for
the
runner
who
then
only
has
one
map
to
carry
most
ski
maps
show
dangerous
avalanche
slopes
the
local
summer
map
published
in
most
tourist
centres
in
switzerland
is
not
much
use
to
the
ski
runner
because
it
shows
walks
which
may
be
along
slopes
or
down
cliffs
which
are
perfectly
safe
in
summer
and
very
dangerous
in
winter
i
strongly
advise
all
beginners
who
are
bitten
by
the
joy
of
to
buy
at
any
rate
the
small
local
sheet
of
the
ordnance
map
which
usually
only
costs
frs
or
roughly
and
to
study
it
carefully
noticing
the
contour
lines
on
the
nursery
slopes
and
gradually
realizing
the
gradient
represented
by
the
different
widths
between
them
let
him
also
notice
the
difference
between
a
hill
and
a
hole
on
the
map
this
is
easily
recognized
either
by
the
thin
blue
line
of
a
stream
emerging
from
a
lake
or
by
comparing
the
nearest
heights
shown
on
the
dotted
lines
or
some
marked
point
contours
are
often
puzzling
to
a
beginner
in
map
reading
but
knowledge
of
what
they
represent
may
save
a
party
from
a
weary
climb
back
up
a
place
they
have
gaily
down
thinking
they
could
get
through
but
finding
an
impossible
slope
or
fall
of
rock
which
forced
them
to
retrace
their
steps
before
going
on
tour
even
with
a
guide
it
is
wise
to
study
the
map
with
a
view
to
knowing
where
an
alpine
hut
can
be
found
in
case
of
need
or
where
a
hay
châlet
could
offer
shelter
when
once
the
ski
runner
has
begun
to
appreciate
the
fun
and
interest
of
running
by
a
map
he
will
never
leave
it
behind
and
he
will
be
able
to
enjoy
all
sorts
of
runs
he
would
never
know
of
if
he
were
content
with
the
sheep
habit
of
following
tracks
the
greatest
fun
of
is
in
finding
one
own
way
and
this
one
can
never
hope
to
do
without
a
map
the
following
scale
of
comparative
heights
in
metres
and
feet
may
be
of
use
in
estimating
the
heights
of
points
which
the
ski
runner
wishes
to
reach
metres
equal
feet
approximately
a
compass
is
of
course
useful
when
running
by
map
but
as
precipices
are
apt
to
get
in
the
way
when
running
straight
for
any
given
point
a
compass
can
not
be
trusted
alone
in
the
case
of
fog
it
is
very
difficult
to
avoid
difficulties
and
points
on
the
map
can
only
be
identified
by
the
use
of
an
aneroid
as
well
as
a
compass
set
the
aneroid
at
the
point
you
start
from
and
check
your
heights
by
this
as
you
climb
or
descend
referring
constantly
to
the
map
to
ensure
that
you
are
running
on
the
right
line
it
is
wise
to
practise
this
on
clear
days
in
order
to
get
accustomed
to
running
by
map
compass
and
aneroid
as
the
weather
also
affects
the
aneroid
it
should
be
constantly
reset
at
known
levels
all
this
may
sound
very
confusing
and
most
beginners
will
probably
prefer
to
take
a
guide
who
knows
his
country
well
rather
than
trust
to
elementary
knowledge
in
unknown
country
most
runners
who
go
on
tour
will
find
running
much
more
interesting
however
if
instead
of
following
a
guide
blindly
they
also
watch
the
map
or
get
a
knowledge
of
what
is
good
or
bad
country
to
run
over
there
are
sometimes
cases
also
when
the
party
must
necessarily
divide
and
an
amateur
may
have
to
take
the
lead
over
unknown
country
avalanches
much
has
been
written
on
this
subject
arnold
lunn
in
the
alps
tells
some
extraordinary
stories
about
these
monsters
of
the
mountains
my
father
john
addington
symonds
in
our
life
in
the
swiss
highlands
also
describes
them
there
was
a
very
interesting
article
by
monsieur
krahnstoever
in
the
swiss
ski
club
for
on
the
subject
of
avalanches
in
relation
to
they
are
an
everlasting
nightmare
to
ski
runners
in
high
places
and
beginners
should
at
once
take
care
to
learn
all
they
can
of
in
order
in
so
far
as
possible
to
realize
what
is
safe
and
what
is
dangerous
the
steepness
of
slopes
and
the
condition
of
snow
as
well
as
the
direction
of
wind
are
all
factors
affecting
avalanches
any
slope
whose
gradient
is
more
than
may
be
dangerous
under
certain
conditions
but
it
may
be
generally
accepted
that
most
long
slopes
under
are
comparatively
safe
so
long
as
they
have
not
much
steeper
slopes
immediately
above
or
below
them
new
snow
is
always
apt
to
slip
before
it
has
had
time
to
settle
down
snow
blown
by
wind
into
a
cornice
or
overhanging
lip
at
the
top
of
a
slope
or
on
a
cliff
may
topple
down
and
start
an
avalanche
wet
snow
after
rain
or
a
warm
föhn
wind
becomes
heavy
and
begins
to
slide
a
very
dangerous
condition
is
new
soft
snow
lying
on
a
slope
covered
with
old
hard
snow
trees
or
rocks
sticking
up
through
the
snow
make
such
slopes
safer
as
they
tend
to
prevent
the
snow
from
beginning
to
slip
this
is
why
the
forestry
laws
of
switzerland
are
so
strict
in
some
districts
the
owner
of
a
forest
may
not
cut
a
tree
unless
it
has
been
approved
by
the
government
forester
this
is
to
ensure
that
the
forests
are
maintained
as
a
protection
for
the
villages
in
the
valleys
below
beginners
should
never
go
on
a
tour
without
first
ascertaining
that
the
route
they
propose
to
follow
is
a
safe
one
and
if
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
owing
to
weather
conditions
they
should
put
it
off
for
a
day
or
two
some
runs
are
perfectly
safe
when
the
snow
has
settled
and
a
sharp
frost
has
bound
it
but
they
may
become
dangerous
again
when
a
thaw
sets
in
a
föhn
wind
is
blowing
or
rain
has
fallen
the
ski
runner
himself
may
start
an
avalanche
on
a
slope
where
the
snow
would
lie
safely
if
he
did
not
pass
along
it
the
cutting
of
his
track
breaking
the
continuity
of
the
snow
may
set
it
going
either
above
or
below
him
and
he
will
be
carried
away
with
it
wherever
there
seems
to
be
the
slightest
risk
of
avalanche
the
party
should
separate
and
proceed
in
single
file
at
about
intervals
then
if
a
runner
is
carried
away
the
others
will
be
able
to
go
to
his
assistance
in
some
cases
however
even
this
is
not
sufficient
protection
as
the
whole
slope
may
go
at
once
in
old
days
before
the
railways
had
tunnelled
through
the
passes
we
were
driving
over
the
fluela
above
davos
on
our
way
to
italy
in
march
we
were
in
the
post
consisting
of
some
sledges
and
had
just
left
the
hospiz
when
we
met
the
post
also
consisting
of
a
number
of
sledges
it
took
some
time
to
pass
as
the
track
was
narrow
and
the
horses
floundered
in
the
deep
snow
when
passing
each
other
after
we
had
got
by
and
were
continuing
on
our
way
down
to
süs
we
turned
along
an
outstanding
buttress
of
cliff
and
saw
that
some
two
miles
of
steep
slope
ahead
had
avalanched
the
whole
surface
of
the
snow
had
slipped
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
if
either
of
the
diligences
had
been
on
this
slope
when
it
happened
horses
sledges
and
all
would
have
been
carried
away
this
experience
fixed
avalanche
danger
very
firmly
in
my
mind
and
having
also
seen
several
large
avalanches
falling
as
well
as
the
immense
amount
of
damage
done
to
forests
and
châlets
by
these
insuperable
monsters
i
have
never
wished
to
risk
getting
into
a
large
one
myself
even
a
small
avalanche
is
very
overwhelming
and
a
beginner
who
has
felt
its
effects
soon
realizes
what
it
may
mean
choose
a
short
steep
slope
on
a
day
when
the
snow
is
slipping
and
try
to
get
it
going
once
it
moves
and
entangles
your
legs
and
skis
you
will
feel
the
extraordinary
helplessness
which
results
this
was
one
of
our
games
when
i
was
a
child
without
skis
it
is
possible
to
float
on
top
of
a
baby
avalanche
and
to
enjoy
it
but
with
skis
on
the
feet
soon
become
entangled
and
helplessness
results
the
first
thing
to
do
when
an
avalanche
starts
and
no
escape
is
possible
is
to
get
the
ski
bindings
undone
and
the
feet
free
then
swim
with
arms
and
legs
and
try
to
keep
on
top
if
buried
keep
one
arm
over
nose
and
mouth
so
as
to
keep
air
space
and
push
the
other
arm
up
pointing
the
ski
stick
through
to
the
open
so
that
it
may
show
your
whereabouts
this
is
easy
to
describe
but
probably
not
so
easy
to
carry
out
if
the
occasion
arises
one
of
the
first
books
on
advises
people
to
carry
some
metres
of
red
tape
and
to
let
this
trail
behind
them
when
crossing
dangerous
ground
then
if
overwhelmed
by
an
avalanche
the
red
thread
can
be
picked
up
by
the
search
party
and
the
victim
may
quickly
be
dug
out
i
have
never
met
anyone
who
has
carried
out
this
suggestion
and
do
not
want
the
extra
weight
of
red
tape
in
my
rucksack
but
it
makes
one
think
and
realize
how
much
other
experienced
runners
have
thought
also
the
following
precautions
would
seem
to
me
to
be
better
never
ski
along
or
above
or
below
a
slope
under
doubtful
conditions
never
go
for
a
tour
without
making
sure
beforehand
that
the
route
you
propose
to
follow
is
a
safe
one
always
carry
out
any
instructions
your
guide
or
the
experienced
leader
of
your
party
may
give
if
you
have
any
sudden
doubt
about
the
safety
of
the
slope
you
are
on
make
quickly
for
the
nearest
rocks
sticking
up
if
there
are
trees
near
get
among
them
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
you
can
if
the
snow
begins
to
slip
and
you
see
no
chance
of
quickly
away
from
the
dangerous
place
get
your
skis
off
this
is
where
toe
bindings
may
be
safer
than
heel
bindings
as
they
come
off
quicker
never
follow
a
track
across
a
slope
about
which
you
are
doubtful
thinking
hopefully
that
the
runner
who
cut
it
knew
more
than
yourself
never
cut
a
track
across
a
dangerous
place
at
your
own
risk
if
there
is
the
slightest
chance
of
misleading
another
runner
into
danger
later
remember
that
though
you
yourself
may
be
on
a
safe
slope
the
slope
above
or
below
you
may
be
so
steep
that
the
snow
may
slip
off
by
itself
and
your
slope
may
be
involved
this
applies
equally
to
running
along
the
bottom
of
a
valley
the
slopes
on
either
side
may
be
dangerous
and
if
the
snow
slips
you
will
be
buried
there
are
so
many
perfectly
safe
runs
that
it
is
folly
to
risk
being
killed
by
an
avalanche
when
it
can
easily
be
avoided
by
a
little
forethought
and
common
sense
even
if
you
do
not
mind
the
risk
yourself
think
not
only
of
your
people
waiting
below
but
also
of
the
people
who
have
to
come
and
look
for
your
body
there
have
been
several
cases
where
the
search
party
have
been
overwhelmed
by
a
second
avalanche
while
digging
for
people
carried
away
by
the
first
january
and
march
are
probably
the
most
dangerous
months
from
the
avalanche
point
of
view
in
january
the
fresh
snow
is
apt
to
slide
before
it
has
settled
a
few
days
after
a
new
snowfall
most
of
the
avalanches
will
have
come
down
and
the
ordinary
runs
will
be
safe
again
but
every
snowfall
entails
the
same
risk
there
are
some
slopes
where
the
snow
will
never
stay
in
february
but
unless
a
föhn
wind
or
rain
make
the
snow
heavy
most
slopes
are
pretty
safe
below
a
gradient
of
in
march
when
the
thaw
begins
more
avalanches
will
fall
these
usually
come
down
tracks
and
can
easily
be
avoided
for
this
reason
this
chapter
may
appear
to
be
somewhat
intimidating
but
it
is
better
to
be
safe
than
sorry
very
few
experienced
ski
runners
get
into
avalanches
and
if
ordinary
precautions
are
taken
and
the
advice
of
experts
followed
beginners
need
have
no
fear
the
maps
usually
show
the
more
dangerous
places
but
every
runner
should
keep
his
own
eyes
open
and
learn
all
he
can
of
in
order
to
be
able
to
explore
new
country
as
he
becomes
proficient
accidents
some
people
will
think
that
i
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
dangers
of
considering
the
thousands
of
people
who
ski
every
winter
and
the
extraordinarily
small
number
of
accidents
i
admit
that
i
have
exaggerated
the
dangers
but
i
do
so
quite
deliberately
because
it
is
only
by
realizing
risks
that
they
can
be
avoided
and
my
experience
proves
to
me
that
the
average
man
and
woman
boy
and
girl
have
very
little
appreciation
of
life
lived
up
against
nature
they
set
out
so
lightheartedly
and
often
so
on
an
expedition
without
telling
anyone
where
they
propose
to
go
or
when
they
expect
to
be
home
and
without
having
provided
themselves
with
the
extra
equipment
which
may
prove
to
be
very
necessary
before
the
day
is
finished
while
writing
this
book
i
have
constantly
had
in
mind
centres
above
feet
whence
tours
are
made
among
the
glaciers
and
at
high
levels
where
the
cold
may
be
a
danger
during
the
months
of
january
and
february
much
of
what
i
have
said
of
the
necessity
of
carrying
spare
clothing
in
good
quantity
does
not
apply
so
much
to
places
below
feet
unless
high
tours
are
undertaken
but
wherever
people
ski
there
is
a
possibility
of
accidents
due
to
falls
and
though
these
are
seldom
serious
they
need
attention
when
someone
is
really
lamed
by
knee
or
ankle
becomes
very
difficult
except
to
the
expert
who
can
ski
mainly
on
one
foot
and
walking
through
the
deep
snow
sinking
at
every
step
is
an
agony
so
that
some
form
of
stretcher
becomes
necessary
two
or
better
still
four
skis
tied
together
side
by
side
form
an
excellent
sledge
which
will
travel
straight
downhill
every
easily
it
practically
refuses
to
traverse
a
slope
so
that
the
case
has
to
be
slipped
straight
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
along
the
valley
or
level
below
skis
usually
have
holes
through
the
flat
part
of
the
tip
in
front
a
piece
of
strong
wire
should
be
threaded
through
these
care
being
taken
that
the
skis
lie
parallel
their
whole
length
and
that
the
tips
are
not
drawn
together
too
much
a
stick
must
be
tied
to
the
wire
and
the
ski
tips
to
keep
them
in
position
and
to
take
the
pull
when
the
sledge
is
drawn
along
if
there
are
trees
about
a
branch
can
be
cut
to
serve
this
purpose
if
not
a
ski
stick
must
be
cut
in
half
and
used
it
should
not
project
beyond
the
skis
on
either
side
or
it
will
catch
in
the
snow
the
other
half
of
the
ski
stick
or
another
branch
must
be
tied
across
the
skis
by
the
toe
irons
to
keep
the
skis
parallel
there
also
and
to
give
solidity
to
the
sledge
people
sometimes
tie
a
strap
or
string
round
the
skis
including
their
running
surfaces
forgetting
that
this
will
soon
cut
through
with
the
friction
of
the
snow
to
finish
the
sledge
put
some
fir
branches
on
it
the
bushy
part
of
which
will
make
it
more
comfortable
to
lie
on
the
thick
wood
of
the
branch
part
should
point
towards
the
front
of
the
skis
and
be
fixed
there
if
branches
are
not
available
rucksacks
can
be
used
for
the
injured
person
to
lie
on
he
will
probably
be
more
comfortable
going
downhill
if
he
can
be
laid
downwards
on
the
sledge
to
draw
the
sledge
along
join
a
lap
thong
or
sealskin
or
rope
or
puttee
to
the
outer
ski
tips
and
also
to
the
ends
of
the
stick
across
them
in
order
to
prevent
this
from
pulling
these
skis
forward
too
much
it
is
well
to
tie
a
string
to
the
inner
ski
tips
also
and
join
them
to
the
pulling
rope
another
rope
or
thong
should
be
attached
to
the
stick
and
centre
toe
irons
so
that
this
can
be
held
from
behind
to
prevent
the
sledge
travelling
too
fast
downhill
experienced
runners
will
be
able
to
travel
on
skis
while
getting
this
sledge
down
but
beginners
will
do
well
to
wade
on
foot
especially
the
rear
man
who
has
to
control
the
speed
neither
the
pulling
nor
control
rope
should
be
attached
to
the
body
of
the
person
holding
it
because
a
sudden
jerk
may
pull
him
over
and
the
sledge
be
stopped
suddenly
with
a
jar
to
the
person
hurt
most
club
huts
are
provided
with
excellent
ambulance
sledges
which
may
be
used
and
which
should
be
conscientiously
returned
to
the
rettungschef
of
the
locality
there
is
a
rettungschef
in
every
mountainous
district
whose
duty
it
is
to
help
with
accidents
when
these
are
reported
to
him
he
arranges
to
send
out
guides
and
porters
with
an
ambulance
sledge
to
the
assistance
of
any
party
in
trouble
if
therefore
your
accident
be
a
serious
one
and
you
are
far
from
home
the
wisest
plan
may
be
to
send
one
or
two
of
the
best
runners
down
to
the
nearest
village
for
help
while
the
remainder
stay
with
the
injured
person
for
this
reason
it
is
always
unwise
to
go
out
with
fewer
than
three
in
a
party
five
or
six
are
a
better
number
on
a
long
day
run
remember
the
people
waiting
at
home
and
when
you
have
made
arrangements
for
help
to
go
to
your
party
ring
up
your
friends
and
tell
them
what
has
happened
and
what
you
have
arranged
having
often
seen
the
anxiety
of
relations
and
friends
when
their
party
comes
home
late
i
know
how
important
this
is
even
if
you
are
only
delayed
for
some
small
reason
such
as
a
train
being
late
it
is
kind
to
ring
up
and
this
is
easily
done
as
there
are
telephones
in
almost
every
village
while
on
this
subject
i
would
again
like
to
urge
that
before
going
off
on
an
expedition
of
any
length
the
concierge
and
someone
should
be
told
in
writing
the
destination
the
route
and
the
hour
anticipated
for
return
then
if
the
party
does
not
turn
up
and
no
news
comes
through
a
search
party
can
be
sent
out
with
some
hope
of
finding
them
within
a
reasonable
time
time
is
very
important
in
january
and
february
when
the
weather
is
cold
as
people
can
be
badly
if
benighted
search
parties
are
expensive
luxuries
as
it
is
risky
work
for
the
guides
who
deserve
to
be
well
paid
for
it
i
have
only
once
followed
a
rettungschef
with
his
five
assistants
and
their
ambulance
sledge
and
shall
never
forget
the
pace
at
which
their
lantern
went
ahead
of
us
dancing
like
a
a
runner
had
come
home
at
with
news
that
one
of
the
party
had
hurt
his
knee
some
four
miles
from
home
this
runner
had
already
wisely
rung
up
the
rettungschef
from
the
first
house
he
came
to
and
a
party
of
guides
was
being
collected
i
decided
to
go
out
with
some
friends
in
case
the
accident
was
a
serious
one
and
we
could
bring
the
remainder
of
the
party
home
and
so
save
the
guides
that
duty
they
were
all
beginners
who
were
benighted
we
followed
the
lantern
and
saw
it
stop
and
knew
the
guides
had
reached
the
people
in
trouble
when
we
caught
up
they
already
had
the
patient
looking
like
a
mummy
rolled
up
in
blankets
in
a
canvas
bag
on
the
sledge
i
could
hear
him
choking
over
the
brandy
which
was
being
poured
down
his
throat
he
had
only
hurt
his
knee
but
his
friends
who
were
all
real
novices
had
had
a
wearing
time
getting
him
down
the
way
in
which
the
guides
handled
the
job
filled
me
with
admiration
and
confidence
when
they
found
we
were
ready
to
herd
the
party
home
they
shot
off
with
their
sledge
and
the
lantern
soon
became
a
speck
of
light
in
the
distance
again
i
also
had
a
lantern
that
night
and
found
it
delightful
to
ski
by
but
doubt
whether
anyone
else
profited
much
by
its
light
except
as
a
guide
to
direction
when
a
person
is
hurt
and
helpless
at
a
high
level
in
winter
cold
is
the
most
immediate
danger
and
all
spare
clothing
should
be
piled
on
him
and
his
limbs
should
be
rubbed
to
prevent
when
he
can
not
be
moved
a
fire
might
well
be
lit
if
below
tree
level
where
wood
is
available
because
though
the
lighting
of
fires
is
forbidden
in
the
swiss
forests
a
breach
of
the
law
would
surely
be
overlooked
in
case
of
danger
to
life
the
heat
of
the
fire
would
help
to
keep
the
patient
warm
while
its
light
would
act
as
a
beacon
to
the
search
party
the
following
is
the
code
of
signals
in
use
among
the
alps
alpine
signal
of
a
by
the
waving
of
anything
a
flag
or
stick
with
an
article
of
clothing
attached
six
times
in
a
minute
repeated
after
an
interval
of
one
minute
without
signals
b
by
a
light
flashed
six
times
a
minute
repeated
after
an
interval
of
one
minute
without
signals
c
by
six
sharp
calls
or
whistles
in
the
minute
repeated
after
an
interval
of
one
minute
without
signals
answering
d
anything
waved
a
light
flashed
a
sharp
call
or
whistle
three
times
in
the
minute
repeated
after
an
interval
of
one
minute
without
signals
if
a
ski
runner
does
not
remember
the
exact
signal
any
regular
signal
repeated
a
definite
number
of
times
in
a
minute
with
a
interval
should
prove
sufficient
similarly
if
you
hear
a
signal
repeated
at
short
regular
intervals
you
should
always
suspect
a
call
for
help
an
ordinary
whistle
is
hardly
loud
enough
for
the
sound
to
carry
any
distance
and
a
siren
might
be
better
newspaper
could
be
used
for
a
flare
if
the
party
does
not
possess
a
lantern
or
electric
torch
but
it
would
not
last
long
finally
may
i
suggest
that
everyone
who
takes
up
seriously
and
who
carries
gear
to
be
used
in
emergency
should
be
proficient
in
the
use
of
such
gear
and
not
wait
till
it
is
needed
to
find
out
how
to
fit
it
to
experiment
in
making
an
ambulance
sledge
while
an
injured
person
lies
beside
you
and
when
your
fingers
are
cold
and
people
are
buzzing
round
you
with
suggestions
which
may
or
may
not
be
better
than
your
own
ideas
is
a
bad
plan
it
is
wiser
to
have
made
the
experiment
at
home
and
to
have
got
someone
to
drag
you
down
a
hill
on
the
result
and
then
you
will
know
something
about
it
a
new
game
for
the
nursery
slopes
and
what
fun
for
the
spectators
who
already
think
all
skiers
mad
i
would
like
to
add
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
on
accidents
that
during
the
many
years
i
have
enjoyed
and
with
the
hundreds
of
beginners
i
have
helped
i
have
never
met
with
a
single
really
serious
accident
one
or
two
knees
and
ankles
twisted
and
now
and
then
a
cut
or
severe
bruise
have
been
among
the
worst
cases
i
have
come
across
the
attractions
of
though
some
runners
are
content
merely
to
enjoy
the
actual
practice
of
with
all
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
and
the
various
turns
to
be
perfected
the
greater
proportion
probably
ski
mainly
on
account
of
the
exhilaration
obtained
the
freedom
enjoyed
and
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
places
reached
the
amazing
thing
is
that
skis
were
not
used
sooner
among
the
alps
they
have
already
in
less
than
thirty
years
entirely
altered
the
life
of
the
young
people
in
villages
who
used
to
be
practically
shut
up
during
the
winter
months
but
who
can
now
ski
from
one
place
to
another
on
sundays
and
holidays
enjoying
the
companionship
of
their
friends
and
widening
their
outlook
by
mixing
with
strangers
this
will
probably
have
a
very
good
effect
on
the
population
of
the
high
alps
who
will
be
less
inclined
to
leave
their
homes
in
order
to
get
away
from
the
monotony
of
the
long
winters
so
much
is
this
appreciated
that
is
now
part
of
the
school
curriculum
in
some
districts
often
taking
the
place
of
gymnastics
during
the
winter
it
is
amusing
to
watch
the
classes
of
children
out
on
the
nursery
slopes
with
their
teachers
while
we
foreign
women
are
provided
with
elaborate
costumes
including
breeches
or
trousers
the
little
swiss
girls
ski
in
frocks
and
cotton
pinafores
without
cap
or
hat
and
often
without
gloves
led
by
their
teacher
they
wearily
climb
up
the
slopes
and
then
comes
the
mad
career
home
to
the
midday
meal
twenty
or
thirty
little
girls
all
dashing
down
together
practising
turns
as
they
go
or
making
as
straight
down
as
they
dare
in
their
effort
to
outpace
their
rivals
the
boys
carry
the
sport
still
further
and
most
local
competitions
start
with
a
demonstration
by
the
boys
who
often
do
not
look
more
than
or
years
old
and
who
go
over
the
big
jump
as
straight
as
their
elders
and
usually
a
good
deal
more
gaily
as
they
have
not
begun
to
appreciate
the
dangers
the
smaller
boys
line
the
sides
of
the
jump
and
pour
out
at
the
word
of
the
judge
on
to
the
steep
like
a
lot
of
little
goblins
jumping
on
their
skis
horizontally
to
flatten
away
any
track
or
hole
made
by
a
jumper
who
has
failed
to
jump
perfectly
little
chaps
of
seven
or
eight
run
through
the
woods
on
these
occasions
swanking
their
turns
through
the
trees
and
putting
most
runners
to
shame
by
their
nimbleness
at
pontresina
one
winter
i
was
much
amused
by
one
of
these
small
children
wearing
a
british
test
badge
which
he
must
have
picked
up
i
asked
him
where
he
got
it
but
he
hurried
away
for
fear
i
would
claim
it
and
his
christianias
through
the
big
trees
made
me
very
envious
many
of
the
children
ski
to
school
and
back
getting
endless
practice
all
through
the
winter
months
may
i
here
appeal
to
british
runners
who
may
have
old
skis
even
broken
ones
to
throw
away
to
offer
them
to
the
local
branch
of
the
swiss
ski
club
as
there
is
an
organization
which
mends
them
or
cuts
them
down
for
lending
or
giving
to
the
school
children
who
are
too
poor
to
provide
themselves
with
skis
when
the
beginner
has
learnt
the
elements
of
straight
running
and
turns
and
begins
to
go
off
among
the
mountains
the
real
interest
of
is
begun
with
the
slow
climb
up
in
single
file
first
of
all
through
woods
and
then
out
on
to
the
open
slopes
this
is
usually
a
silent
game
as
breath
is
needed
for
the
climb
and
it
is
dull
work
keeping
up
a
conversation
with
the
back
ahead
sometimes
as
one
inadvertently
steps
on
the
skis
ahead
a
gruff
word
is
flung
back
and
the
trespasser
is
wise
who
stops
pretending
to
attend
to
his
binding
or
to
look
at
the
view
the
view
is
usually
worth
looking
at
too
as
there
is
usually
something
to
see
if
it
is
not
a
distant
view
of
the
great
alps
or
of
the
valley
below
it
is
of
trees
or
rocks
which
if
examined
carefully
usually
show
some
sign
of
life
i
remember
being
snubbed
by
an
ardent
because
i
ventured
to
ask
what
are
those
black
birds
who
wants
to
know
about
birds
when
he
is
was
the
answer
i
did
want
to
know
and
i
found
out
that
they
were
alpine
choughs
and
i
still
want
to
know
when
i
see
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
or
their
tracks
most
of
the
wild
animals
use
old
ski
tracks
as
highways
now
even
finding
it
worth
while
to
follow
the
zigzag
of
an
uphill
traverse
foxes
hares
and
roe
deer
all
use
them
the
roe
deers
feet
showing
so
much
tinier
than
the
chamois
who
leaves
a
deep
rough
track
as
they
usually
run
in
each
other
footsteps
the
hare
track
when
running
is
two
holes
abreast
and
then
two
single
ones
the
fox
runs
rather
like
a
dog
the
squirrel
hops
two
feet
at
a
time
often
leaving
a
slight
ruffle
on
the
snow
as
he
swishes
his
tail
among
the
cembra
trees
in
the
engadine
the
snow
may
be
sprinkled
with
the
nuts
out
of
the
cones
they
are
delicious
eating
being
very
like
the
italian
stone
pine
nut
or
pinelli
and
they
attract
the
squirrels
as
much
as
they
do
the
nutcracker
bird
martens
and
pole
cats
leave
distinct
footmarks
weasels
also
and
these
are
easily
recognized
as
they
usually
start
from
a
hole
under
a
bush
or
a
rock
one
day
when
a
party
of
us
were
silently
traversing
a
slope
above
mürren
a
tiny
brown
ball
came
rolling
down
which
when
picked
up
proved
to
be
the
warm
dead
body
of
a
mouse
looking
up
we
saw
a
weasel
peering
out
of
his
hole
anxious
as
to
the
fate
of
his
dinner
a
mouse
track
also
usually
starts
from
a
tiny
hole
and
the
two
feet
go
abreast
while
the
tail
leaves
a
line
all
the
way
we
nearly
always
see
chamois
and
roe
deer
when
in
the
woods
at
pontresina
as
it
is
a
protected
area
and
they
are
not
shot
and
therefore
become
very
tame
the
chamois
are
driven
down
into
the
woods
in
search
of
the
lichen
which
hangs
like
a
beard
from
the
branches
of
the
cembra
trees
on
muottas
celerina
this
winter
we
saw
four
chamois
below
us
in
the
wood
without
a
word
our
guide
caspar
gras
dashed
down
the
slope
after
them
and
very
nearly
caught
one
round
the
neck
as
they
were
surprised
and
knowing
there
was
a
precipice
beyond
the
scrub
below
them
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
which
way
to
go
the
roe
deer
scrape
away
the
snow
below
the
trees
in
search
of
alpenrose
or
bear
berry
leaves
or
dry
blades
of
grass
they
suffer
more
than
the
chamois
after
a
heavy
snowfall
because
they
are
not
so
strong
and
can
not
scamper
through
it
at
the
beginning
of
this
season
klosters
had
a
snowfall
of
some
two
metres
and
the
roe
deer
were
driven
down
to
the
villages
where
the
peasants
fed
them
in
stables
till
the
weather
improved
four
were
caught
on
the
railway
having
got
on
to
the
line
at
a
crossing
and
being
unable
to
spring
out
over
the
high
banks
of
snow
ibex
are
being
let
loose
in
order
to
them
where
they
were
exterminated
a
few
years
ago
they
can
usually
be
seen
through
the
telescope
at
bernina
hauser
above
pontresina
and
also
opposite
mürren
the
ibex
or
steinbock
is
used
as
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
canton
of
graubünden
and
is
familiar
to
ski
runners
as
the
badge
of
the
local
ski
club
of
zuoz
in
the
engadine
after
some
controversy
eagles
are
being
encouraged
to
increase
having
been
almost
exterminated
we
saw
a
beauty
sailing
over
the
muottas
muraigl
valley
one
day
there
is
even
talk
of
trying
to
get
bear
back
but
the
peasants
obstruct
this
as
they
were
so
destructive
to
sheep
as
a
child
at
davos
i
saw
three
bears
brought
in
dead
by
hunters
and
remember
with
pride
mixed
with
disgust
tasting
a
bear
paw
a
peasant
told
me
of
how
as
a
boy
he
looked
after
the
village
sheep
near
the
silvretta
glacier
and
of
a
bear
who
used
to
come
and
kill
a
sheep
and
then
bury
it
in
the
ice
for
future
eating
ski
runners
shudder
at
the
idea
of
meeting
a
bear
while
on
a
run
but
they
need
not
worry
as
the
bears
roll
up
and
sleep
through
the
winter
so
that
unless
the
took
an
unusually
heavy
fall
into
the
hole
he
would
be
safe
enough
on
the
surface
besides
which
it
is
said
that
a
bear
can
not
traverse
down
a
slope
so
that
the
could
easily
get
away
unless
the
bear
rolled
to
the
bottom
and
then
ran
along
and
waited
for
him
as
there
are
no
bears
in
switzerland
now
perhaps
it
is
waste
of
time
to
start
a
controversy
about
the
best
turn
with
which
to
circumvent
a
bear
cows
are
much
more
dangerous
i
was
pursued
down
the
village
street
at
pontresina
by
a
playful
cow
who
had
been
taken
to
the
pump
to
drink
she
put
down
her
head
and
stuck
up
her
tail
and
i
wasted
no
time
in
pushing
away
from
her
another
animal
which
hibernates
through
the
winter
is
the
marmot
and
i
often
think
of
them
sound
asleep
under
the
snow
as
i
pass
along
the
slopes
of
some
high
valley
they
are
said
to
have
breathing
holes
but
i
have
never
seen
them
unless
this
was
the
explanation
of
some
holes
which
puzzled
me
on
the
schiltgrat
above
mürren
i
was
traversing
uphill
a
long
way
ahead
of
my
party
and
noticed
some
isolated
holes
in
the
snow
very
like
ski
stick
holes
but
with
no
ski
tracks
near
as
i
passed
a
grey
hen
flew
out
of
one
of
the
holes
and
looking
back
i
saw
several
black
cocks
and
grey
hens
flying
away
it
is
more
likely
that
they
had
made
their
own
holes
to
shelter
in
rather
than
that
these
were
marmot
holes
ptarmigan
often
greet
one
on
the
higher
ridges
and
sometimes
a
capercailzie
will
get
up
with
a
noise
which
is
very
apt
to
upset
one
the
choughs
are
persistent
followers
of
a
party
flying
over
one
head
and
chirruping
for
lunch
when
at
last
we
stop
and
take
our
nosebags
out
of
our
rucksacks
they
perch
on
a
cliff
near
and
wait
till
we
move
on
when
they
immediately
fly
down
to
see
what
we
have
left
for
them
i
have
seen
a
paper
which
they
were
unable
to
tear
absolutely
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
their
footmarks
some
eight
feet
in
diameter
how
they
must
have
worried
it
and
each
other
in
their
endeavour
to
get
at
the
contents
at
mürren
a
pair
of
ravens
also
accompany
the
they
take
their
perch
high
up
and
watch
the
many
luncheon
parties
croaking
now
and
then
to
remind
us
of
their
wish
to
share
our
slices
of
beef
and
sausage
these
packed
lunches
are
usually
so
plentiful
that
the
choughs
and
the
ravens
get
a
goodly
feed
the
tidy
who
buries
all
his
paper
and
orange
peel
and
other
debris
will
often
find
next
day
that
the
whole
thing
has
been
dug
up
by
a
fox
at
many
of
the
alpine
huts
the
has
adopted
the
habits
of
the
sparrow
and
is
often
so
tame
that
he
will
almost
take
crumbs
from
one
hand
another
bird
i
love
among
the
alps
is
the
dipper
or
water
ouzel
along
the
snow
banks
of
the
rivers
i
have
often
watched
him
hop
down
into
the
water
and
run
along
the
bottom
picking
up
whatever
his
food
is
among
the
pebbles
surely
most
ski
runners
can
spare
time
to
watch
all
these
little
people
whose
rights
to
the
snow
fields
are
even
greater
than
their
own
very
little
vegetation
shows
in
winter
but
it
is
wonderful
what
a
lot
one
can
find
if
one
looks
carefully
and
it
certainly
makes
more
interesting
to
me
if
i
can
recognize
the
trees
plants
and
seeds
a
very
fair
estimate
can
be
made
of
the
different
heights
by
noticing
what
grows
corn
stops
at
to
feet
though
a
little
rye
may
be
grown
up
to
feet
in
sunny
places
fruit
trees
and
beech
trees
stop
at
about
feet
there
is
one
beech
tree
above
davos
about
feet
above
the
sea
but
it
has
never
succeeded
in
topping
the
huge
boulder
which
shelters
it
from
the
north
the
silver
fir
is
healthy
at
feet
but
is
seldom
found
much
above
that
level
while
the
spruce
or
fir
goes
up
to
feet
and
does
best
there
larches
seem
to
thrive
best
at
about
feet
but
may
be
seen
almost
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
bernina
pass
on
the
south
side
facing
italy
the
cembra
pine
like
a
great
cedar
is
the
finest
tree
in
the
alps
and
does
best
at
feet
to
feet
it
is
also
called
the
arolla
pine
because
of
the
forests
near
that
place
in
the
upper
engadine
almost
all
the
forests
are
of
cembra
and
there
is
one
splendid
old
tree
known
as
the
giant
tree
near
upper
tree
level
on
muottas
celerina
another
group
of
veterans
grows
just
below
the
little
scheidegg
on
the
grindelwald
side
many
of
these
trees
are
said
to
be
or
years
old
and
their
wood
is
much
used
for
panelling
in
graubünden
it
is
recognized
by
the
big
dark
knots
the
panels
are
usually
formed
of
boards
reversed
so
that
the
knots
form
a
symmetrical
pattern
larch
is
also
used
and
is
very
red
while
sycamore
goes
to
the
making
of
tables
and
chairs
in
the
bündner
stübli
good
examples
of
the
modern
use
of
these
woods
may
be
seen
in
the
hotels
vereina
and
silvretta
at
klosters
while
the
museum
at
zurich
contains
beautiful
old
panelled
rooms
from
different
districts
creeping
down
steep
avalanche
slopes
above
feet
we
find
whose
long
branches
form
a
tangle
in
which
to
catch
ski
tips
below
feet
this
pine
will
sometimes
grow
almost
upright
but
never
attains
much
height
alder
may
also
be
a
trap
for
skis
on
an
avalanche
slope
where
it
creeps
downhill
and
provides
a
very
slippery
surface
for
the
snow
i
remember
shooting
down
such
a
slope
about
feet
when
the
snow
slipped
with
me
in
a
safe
place
along
the
rivers
the
alder
grows
into
quite
a
fine
tree
and
if
its
catkins
be
picked
at
christmas
and
are
brought
into
the
warm
house
they
soon
blossom
out
and
spread
their
green
pollen
over
everything
rather
a
nice
way
of
bringing
a
reminder
of
spring
into
one
winter
holiday
birch
and
mountain
ash
grow
happily
up
to
feet
on
sheltered
slopes
but
after
feet
there
are
no
deciduous
trees
except
the
tiny
creeping
willows
buried
deep
under
the
snow
juniper
is
the
most
ubiquitous
shrub
to
be
found
it
seems
to
me
you
get
its
various
types
at
sea
level
in
italy
and
on
the
top
of
mountains
up
to
feet
when
it
pokes
up
through
the
snow
beside
the
alpine
rose
or
on
the
top
of
ridges
when
the
snow
is
blown
away
all
sorts
of
treasures
may
be
recognized
the
creeping
azalea
with
its
wee
evergreen
leaves
which
no
one
thinking
of
the
garden
azaleas
at
home
would
recognize
as
belonging
to
the
same
family
little
primulas
and
saxifrages
sheltering
in
cracks
in
the
rocks
with
nothing
but
bunches
of
brown
leaves
to
show
them
up
or
bastard
box
almost
always
in
flower
on
a
sunny
patch
even
in
midwinter
on
the
lower
slopes
gentians
or
anemone
plants
with
their
buds
waiting
to
open
when
the
soft
wind
or
rain
of
spring
calls
to
them
with
its
whitish
buds
waiting
for
spring
to
colour
them
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
flowers
or
the
seeds
of
or
or
and
of
aconite
or
monkshood
on
their
strong
stems
standing
high
above
the
snow
one
winter
when
at
feet
we
had
no
snow
at
christmas
we
went
flower
hunting
instead
of
and
found
thirty
different
sorts
of
flowers
out
but
this
was
exceptional
and
by
no
means
satisfying
to
the
ski
runner
who
has
come
out
for
the
sport
he
loves
and
not
on
botany
intent
later
when
the
snow
begins
to
melt
on
south
slopes
in
march
the
mass
of
purple
and
white
crocuses
open
to
the
sun
nothing
in
the
whole
world
can
equal
the
mass
of
these
crocuses
they
push
up
as
the
miracle
of
spring
impatiently
thrusting
through
the
snow
melting
holes
for
themselves
the
soldanellas
do
the
same
but
not
till
late
in
march
and
with
them
come
gentians
and
the
whole
glory
of
the
alpine
spring
has
begun
by
this
time
the
has
to
oil
and
put
away
his
skis
or
climb
to
the
glaciers
and
higher
snow
fields
a
wonderful
experience
alternating
between
spring
and
winter
as
he
changes
his
levels
summer
the
only
experience
of
summer
which
i
have
had
is
on
the
jungfrau
joch
about
feet
above
the
sea
the
berner
oberland
and
jungfrau
railways
carry
one
up
from
interlaken
to
the
joch
where
there
is
an
excellent
new
hotel
offering
every
possible
comfort
good
can
be
had
on
the
glaciers
and
i
am
surprised
that
more
people
do
not
come
out
for
practice
during
the
summer
the
two
great
to
this
are
firstly
the
expense
and
secondly
the
difficulty
of
breathing
the
expense
is
unavoidable
because
the
carriage
of
building
materials
food
etc
to
such
a
height
must
necessarily
entail
high
prices
glacier
except
on
the
near
the
joch
also
usually
necessitates
the
employment
of
guides
but
these
are
so
extensive
and
so
safe
that
a
week
could
be
spent
in
practising
without
a
guide
after
the
first
night
on
the
joch
the
feeling
of
breathlessness
is
reduced
and
so
long
as
all
climbing
is
done
slowly
no
bad
effects
need
be
expected
by
people
in
good
health
and
condition
the
jungfrau
joch
can
be
reached
from
london
in
hours
and
keen
runners
could
enjoy
a
week
or
a
fortnight
of
amusing
on
snow
which
lends
itself
particularly
well
to
the
practice
of
all
turns
the
jungfrau
joch
branch
of
the
swiss
ski
club
holds
an
annual
meet
on
the
joch
in
the
month
of
july
which
is
well
attended
by
runners
and
jumpers
from
all
parts
of
switzerland
guides
and
ski
instructors
can
be
found
at
the
joch
people
who
would
prefer
not
to
sleep
at
so
great
a
height
could
stay
at
the
scheidegg
or
eiger
gletscher
at
both
of
which
places
hotels
exist
in
view
of
the
shortness
of
winter
holidays
it
seems
a
pity
that
more
enthusiasts
do
not
profit
by
the
chance
of
practising
which
the
jungfrau
joch
railway
offers
in
summer
time
i
have
twice
spent
two
days
up
there
and
have
enjoyed
them
immensely
the
snow
was
very
different
to
anything
i
ever
met
in
winter
but
also
very
easy
and
filled
me
with
confidence
in
july
and
august
the
crevasses
show
clearly
and
need
not
inspire
anxiety
in
anyone
except
after
a
new
fall
of
snow
which
may
hide
the
smaller
ones
temporarily
again
there
must
be
several
square
miles
of
perfectly
safe
on
the
glaciers
behind
the
joch
which
provide
nursery
slopes
just
as
good
as
anything
found
in
winter
the
gradients
vary
but
it
is
easy
to
find
stretches
of
to
unbroken
by
crevasses
anyone
coming
out
to
ski
on
the
glaciers
in
summer
time
should
bring
with
them
their
own
skis
or
arrange
to
hire
these
at
some
winter
sports
centre
in
the
valleys
they
should
also
be
provided
with
all
the
equipment
they
may
need
a
few
pairs
of
skis
are
kept
for
hiring
purposes
on
the
jungfrau
joch
but
they
are
not
very
good
ones
and
it
would
be
better
not
to
depend
on
them
