clara
swain
first
medical
missionary
to
the
women
of
the
orient
by
robert
hoskins
the
frail
little
mother
of
a
frail
little
daughter
did
not
live
long
enough
to
see
the
fullest
answer
to
her
prayer
that
her
youngest
born
might
grow
up
to
be
a
good
and
useful
woman
for
she
passed
away
before
her
daughter
began
her
medical
career
but
the
prayer
was
not
forgotten
by
him
who
ever
hears
the
cry
of
those
who
call
upon
him
in
faith
clara
was
the
youngest
of
the
ten
children
of
john
and
clarissa
seavey
swain
she
was
born
in
elmira
but
when
she
was
two
years
old
her
parents
returned
to
their
old
home
in
castile
and
here
she
spent
her
early
life
early
life
she
was
not
a
strong
child
and
being
the
youngest
of
a
large
family
naturally
received
much
attention
which
in
after
years
she
concluded
was
not
good
for
her
she
once
described
herself
as
a
puny
little
thing
who
wanted
everything
she
saw
and
thought
she
ought
to
have
it
i
had
a
will
of
my
own
she
said
and
my
mother
found
it
necessary
to
be
very
firm
with
me
at
times
once
i
was
very
rude
to
her
when
she
did
not
give
me
what
i
wanted
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
grieved
she
was
how
lovingly
she
explained
to
me
the
necessity
for
controlling
myself
if
i
would
be
loved
by
those
around
me
she
was
six
years
old
when
this
naughtiness
occurred
i
promised
my
mother
then
she
said
that
i
would
be
a
good
girl
and
that
i
would
ask
god
not
to
let
me
be
naughty
again
she
and
her
sister
hattie
not
quite
two
years
her
elder
loved
out
of
doors
a
great
deal
they
were
very
fond
of
flowers
and
animals
and
hand
in
hand
would
wander
up
and
down
the
street
to
stop
and
admire
the
flowers
in
the
neighboring
gardens
always
mindful
of
their
mother
injunction
never
to
take
a
flower
without
permission
happy
indeed
were
they
when
they
could
bring
home
a
handful
of
wild
flowers
to
their
mother
god
flowers
they
called
them
because
they
did
not
grow
in
anyone
garden
clara
love
for
animals
led
her
to
pat
every
dog
she
met
and
more
than
once
she
caught
a
stray
cat
and
took
it
home
to
pet
it
a
story
is
told
that
seeing
a
lame
chicken
she
wrapped
it
in
her
apron
and
took
it
home
and
bandaged
its
leg
neatly
tending
it
with
such
devotion
that
she
soon
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
it
able
to
run
about
to
seek
its
own
food
the
cousin
who
told
this
story
laughingly
said
she
probably
used
splints
but
of
this
i
am
not
sure
swain
sister
elizabeth
lived
a
mile
out
of
the
village
while
the
home
of
the
swain
family
was
within
the
boundary
line
and
as
the
little
red
was
between
them
the
children
of
both
families
attended
this
school
clara
was
very
fond
of
her
aunt
post
and
often
went
home
with
her
cousins
staying
with
them
days
at
a
time
one
of
these
cousins
now
years
of
age
writes
when
clara
was
seven
years
of
age
she
was
a
very
pleasant
child
always
eager
to
help
someone
she
lived
with
us
off
and
on
until
she
was
twelve
years
old
when
we
moved
to
michigan
she
was
as
much
at
home
with
us
as
in
her
own
home
and
we
were
sorry
to
part
with
her
conversion
when
clara
was
eight
years
old
her
sister
ann
six
years
her
senior
joined
the
methodist
church
and
this
made
a
great
impression
on
her
youthful
mind
the
consistent
life
of
this
sister
and
the
sweet
and
simple
religious
life
of
her
mother
gave
her
many
thoughtful
hours
and
she
asked
one
day
why
am
i
not
a
christian
i
want
to
be
good
too
just
before
she
was
ten
years
old
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
sermon
she
felt
that
she
must
give
herself
to
the
lord
to
be
his
child
forever
there
were
hours
of
darkness
when
she
felt
that
she
was
too
great
a
sinner
to
be
forgiven
but
light
came
at
last
and
she
was
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
she
was
an
accepted
child
of
god
from
her
father
family
she
inherited
a
fund
of
irish
humor
while
her
mother
of
good
old
new
england
blood
inclined
to
quietness
of
spirit
with
earnestness
of
purpose
and
this
blending
of
fun
and
sobriety
caused
the
young
christian
much
perturbation
of
spirit
conscientious
in
the
extreme
she
had
many
an
hour
of
when
she
feared
that
in
the
exuberance
of
youthful
merriment
she
had
cast
a
shadow
on
her
christian
profession
and
caused
sorrow
to
the
heart
of
her
loving
master
then
it
was
that
the
wise
and
tender
mother
helped
her
to
see
that
it
was
the
duty
of
a
christian
though
only
a
child
to
be
cheerful
and
joyous
and
that
it
was
possible
to
please
god
in
her
play
hours
as
well
as
in
attendance
at
church
or
sunday
school
or
prayer
meeting
just
to
be
the
happy
child
that
he
meant
her
to
be
and
to
ask
his
help
to
keep
her
good
and
true
her
school
books
did
not
satisfy
her
mind
and
one
who
knew
her
at
that
time
says
she
frequently
visited
the
neighbors
and
borrowed
books
some
of
which
she
read
over
and
over
again
her
love
for
children
led
her
when
she
was
about
twelve
years
old
to
accept
the
proposal
of
the
wife
of
the
village
merchant
that
she
assist
her
in
the
care
of
her
baby
and
the
money
thus
earned
was
used
to
help
her
with
her
studies
in
clara
sister
ann
went
to
michigan
to
teach
making
her
home
with
the
aunt
post
who
had
been
so
dear
to
the
children
of
the
swain
family
after
two
years
of
teaching
she
was
married
from
her
aunt
home
to
a
worthy
man
who
still
survives
her
before
ann
marriage
clara
had
gone
to
visit
this
aunt
and
was
persuaded
to
stay
and
eventually
she
took
a
small
school
near
the
farm
and
taught
for
a
year
while
she
was
teaching
wrote
one
of
her
cousins
my
mother
broke
her
ankle
and
clara
cared
for
her
almost
a
year
she
was
a
grand
nurse
even
at
that
age
and
was
a
great
comfort
to
us
all
she
was
so
bright
and
cheerful
that
we
were
unwilling
to
have
her
leave
us
her
talent
for
nursing
was
called
into
requisition
soon
after
her
return
to
castile
when
the
children
of
the
presbyterian
minister
the
rev
hurlburt
became
ill
with
typhoid
fever
and
she
was
called
to
assist
in
caring
for
them
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
the
nurse
as
well
as
the
parents
as
one
child
after
another
fell
two
of
the
children
died
and
later
the
father
succumbed
to
the
fatal
illness
the
faithful
nurse
remained
with
the
distracted
widow
and
the
remaining
children
can
cared
for
them
tenderly
as
long
as
they
needed
her
services
in
an
old
and
bible
is
this
inscription
in
her
handwriting
this
is
the
first
bible

ever
owned

was
presented
to
me
by
rev

mrs
hurlburt
the
sumer
of
found
miss
swain
then
years
of
age
teaching
a
few
private
pupils
in
the
village
one
of
her
scholars
of
that
summer
recently
spoke
of
her
loving
interest
in
her
pupils
and
her
care
for
their
welfare
the
following
year
she
went
to
live
with
some
cousins
in
pike
and
attend
the
school
there
swain
had
a
sister
living
in
canandaigua
who
knowing
of
clara
strong
desire
for
invited
her
to
come
there
for
a
year
of
study
in
the
seminary
an
invitation
which
she
gladly
accepted
and
after
a
year
of
close
study
she
obtained
a
position
as
teacher
in
the
primary
department
of
one
of
the
public
schools
clara
was
determined
to
get
an
education
and
make
use
of
it
if
she
could
wrote
one
of
her
cousins
teaching
in
canandaigua
in
the
spring
of
began
an
acquaintance
with
one
who
was
ever
after
one
of
miss

dearest
friends
miss
martha
mcfarland
of
albany
accepted
the
position
of
teacher
in
the
intermediate
department
of
the
school
in
which
miss
swain
was
teaching
and
they
at
once
became
friends
as
miss
swain
aunt
was
soon
to
leave
canandaigua
the
two
friends
secured
a
pleasant
and
for
three
years
they
walked
to
school
together
in
the
morning
and
home
again
in
the
afternoon
bothe
were
and
many
a
delightful
hour
they
spent
on
their
holidays
and
saturday
afternoons
and
whenever
they
could
find
leisure
for
one
of
their
picnic
outings
they
were
both
members
of
the
methodist
church
and
were
constant
in
their
attendance
at
the
sunday
services
and
at
sunday
school
as
well
as
at
the
midweek
prayer
and
and
were
ever
ready
to
help
in
all
forms
of
church
work
through
her
years
of
teaching
miss
swain
showed
the
same
conscientious
spirit
that
was
evidenced
in
her
child
and
school
life
have
i
done
all
i
ought
have
i
been
as
helpful
to
my
pupils
as
i
might
be
she
often
asked
herself
for
a
time
she
taught
a
class
in
sunday
school
and
her
boys
were
impressed
by
her
consistent
life
later
one
of
them
said
we
noticed
that
you
always
went
to
prayer
meeting
so
we
thought
we
would
go
and
see
what
was
in
it
this
class
was
a
joy
to
her
and
her
pleasure
was
great
when
one
and
another
gave
himself
to
the
lord
for
service
miss
swain
was
ready
season
and
out
of
said
one
of
her
friends
one
sunday
evening
when
a
company
of
us
were
together
having
a
sing
she
turned
to
a
young
man
near
her
and
bluntly
asked
are
you
not
a
christian
taken
by
surprise
the
young
man
had
no
answer
ready
and
they
both
went
on
singing
the
rev
hibbard
was
pastor
of
the
methodist
church
in
canandaigua
and
miss
swain
and
her
friend
very
much
enjoyed
an
occasional
visit
to
the
parsonage
where
they
were
always
warmly
welcomed
training
in
the
sanitarium
notwithstanding
her
love
for
children
miss
swain
did
not
find
teaching
altogether
a
delight
the
inattention
of
the
children
and
the
daily
routine
made
her
feel
irritable
she
said
but
she
kept
steadily
on
hoping
in
time
to
carry
out
a
purpose
which
she
had
in
mind
of
some
day
becoming
a
doctor
when
an
opportunity
offered
for
her
to
take
a
position
in
the
castile
sanitarium
under
cordelia
greene
she
gladly
gave
up
teaching
and
entered
upon
a
course
of
training
which
though
sometimes
irksome
proved
more
congenial
than
her
former
occupation
all
the
way
along
her
strong
will
had
availed
to
overcome
obstacles
and
here
during
many
weary
hours
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
she
was
nearing
the
goal
of
her
ambition
she
could
not
have
had
a
more
satisfactory
opportunity
for
the
training
that
she
needed
for
though
greene
exacted
thoroughness
in
every
line
of
work
she
was
so
sympathetic
and
so
ready
to
give
a
word
of
commendation
and
encouragement
that
her
pupil
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accede
to
all
the
requirements
of
her
position
it
was
not
long
before
doctor
and
pupil
became
fast
friends
and
the
congenial
companionship
was
a
pleasure
to
both
i
owe
much
to
cordelia
she
said
many
times
in
after
life
at
the
medical
college
after
three
years
of
study
and
practice
in
the
sanitarium
she
applied
for
admission
to
the
woman
medical
college
in
philadelphia
from
which
she
was
graduated
in
the
spring
of
she
often
spoke
of
the
pleasure
she
had
in
lingering
in
the
park
after
class
hours
on
her
way
to
her
and
of
the
occasional
free
and
intimate
talks
with
certain
of
her
instructors
she
enjoyed
the
sabbath
services
and
had
many
opportunities
of
hearing
some
of
the
celebrated
preachers
of
the
day
the
rev
dana
boardman
seems
to
have
been
a
favorite
with
her
and
she
took
notes
of
several
of
his
sermons
bishop
simpson
christmas
sermon
on
luke
filled
my
heart
with
peace
and
to
all
men
she
notes
a
sermon
by
willett
in
november
on
what
do
ye
more
than
others
matt
and
one
by
mcgowan
on
mark
one
thing
thou
lackest
led
to
much
a
short
time
before
leaving
philadelphia
she
heard
phillips
brooks
preach
from
malachi
a
wonderful
sermon
she
termed
it
and
she
greatly
enjoyed
a
talk
by
him
on
tithing
which
she
determined
to
act
upon
we
have
no
special
record
of
swain
years
of
study
in
the
woman
medical
college
but
we
may
be
sure
that
she
improved
every
opportunity
to
perfect
herself
in
her
chosen
calling
her
instructors
were
her
warm
friends
and
she
corresponded
with
some
of
them
after
she
went
to
india
dean
bodley
in
one
of
her
letters
gave
the
names
of
nine
young
women
in
the
college
who
were
preparing
for
medical
missionary
work
and
swain
made
a
note
of
them
saying
that
she
must
write
to
them
before
their
graduation
two
of
these
ladies
went
to
india
as
medical
missionaries
call
to
service
in
india
the
story
of
swain
call
to
go
to
india
has
been
told
many
times
thomas
who
with
her
husband
had
charge
of
the
girls
orphanage
of
the
methodist
mission
had
long
felt
the
need
of
efficient
medical
aid
for
the
women
and
children
of
india
and
had
been
doing
what
she
could
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
those
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
she
had
even
thought
that
she
would
herself
study
medicine
when
she
should
go
to
america
for
change
and
rest
in
the
meantime
she
was
instructing
a
class
of
the
older
girls
in
the
orphanage
in
physiology
and
hygiene
both
in
english
and
the
vernacular
with
the
hope
that
some
time
they
might
have
regular
medical
training
she
talked
with
native
gentlemen
and
with
english
officials
of
the
great
need
for
intelligent
medical
treatment
for
the
women
and
children
of
the
country
especially
for
those
who
live
in
seclusion
and
of
her
hope
that
a
lady
medical
missionary
might
be
sent
to
india
a
native
gentleman
so
thoroughly
approved
of
the
idea
that
he
offered
to
defray
all
the
expenses
of
a
medical
school
or
class
if
a
lady
physician
could
be
sent
from
america
to
take
charge
of
it
thomas
letter
of
appeal
to
gracey
a
former
missionary
for
her
assistance
in
the
matter
led
gracey
to
inquire
at
the
philadelphia
woman
medical
college
if
a
suitable
person
could
be
found
among
the
graduates
who
would
accept
a
call
from
the
woman
union
missionary
society
of
america
to
go
as
a
medical
missionary
to
india
miss
clara
swain
was
named
as
one
fitted
by
both
professional
acquirements
and
christian
character
for
such
a
position
it
required
much
thought
and
prayer
on
swain
part
before
she
could
signify
her
acceptance
of
the
call
and
during
the
three
months
of
delay
in
giving
her
answer
the
woman
foreign
missionary
society
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
of
which
she
was
a
member
was
organized
naturally
she
preferred
to
go
under
the
auspices
of
her
own
denomination
and
the
union
missionary
society
gracefully
and
generously
accepted
her
decision
confident
that
she
was
obeying
the
call
of
god
she
set
about
her
preparations
for
the
long
journey
before
her
in
a
cheerful
spirit
answering
the
demurs
of
her
friends
with
it
is
god
call
i
must
go
she
was
greatly
cheered
when
she
found
that
miss
isabella
thoburn
whose
brother
now
bishop
thoburn
had
been
some
years
in
india
was
to
be
her
traveling
companion
they
sailed
from
new
york
november
and
arrived
in
bareilly
january
during
the
annual
conference
of
the
methodist
mission
appointment
to
bareilly
the
two
ladies
whose
previous
slight
acquaintance
had
ripened
into
warmest
friendship
during
their
weeks
of
journeying
together
had
hoped
that
they
might
be
associated
together
in
mission
work
but
it
was
not
so
to
be
miss
thoburn
was
appointed
to
educational
work
in
lucknow
and
swain
found
that
she
was
to
remain
in
bareilly
this
appointment
gave
her
the
opportunity
to
begin
her
medical
work
at
once
for
there
were
not
only
the
orphanage
for
which
thomas
had
so
long
desired
efficient
medical
help
but
scores
of
christian
women
who
could
not
go
to
the
city
hospital
in
addition
to
these
there
was
the
class
of
fourteen
intelligent
christian
girls
that
had
for
two
years
been
receiving
excellent
preparatory
training
from
thomas
who
had
fully
believed
that
her
prayer
for
a
lady
doctor
would
be
answered
and
that
these
girls
would
yet
have
the
opportunity
for
the
study
of
medicine
and
thomas
were
well
acquainted
with
several
of
the
wealthy
and
influential
natives
of
the
city
and
thomas
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
introduce
her
doctor
friend
to
these
homes
there
was
no
lack
of
patients
for
the
new
doctor
for
in
addition
to
her
work
in
the
orphanage
and
her
medical
class
calls
to
native
homes
in
the
city
became
more
and
more
frequent
at
the
end
of
the
first
six
weeks
after
her
arrival
in
bareilly
note
book
recorded
one
hundred
and
eight
patients
her
report
to
the
conference
after
a
year
of
such
service
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
gave
the
number
of
patients
prescribed
for
at
the
mission
house
as
twelve
hundred
and
and
of
visits
to
patients
in
their
homes
two
hundred
and
fifty
the
young
women
of
the
medical
class
were
gaining
practice
and
experience
by
caring
for
the
sick
in
the
orphanage
and
the
christian
village
and
sometimes
accompanying
swain
to
visit
her
city
patients
and
they
were
also
becoming
proficient
in
compounding
and
dispensing
medicines
this
class
begun
march
was
graduated
april
having
passed
an
excellent
examination
before
two
civil
surgeons
and
an
american
physician
from
whom
they
received
certificates
entitling
them
to
practice
in
all
ordinary
diseases
the
nawab
gift
the
need
for
a
dispensary
and
hospital
became
daily
more
imperative
and
it
was
opportunely
met
in
the
munificent
gift
of
the
nawab
of
rampore
who
owned
an
estate
adjoining
the
mission
premises
in
bareilly
the
hon
drummond
the
commissioner
of
the
northwest
provinces
was
interested
in
mission
work
especially
in
the
effort
to
help
the
women
of
the
city
and
neighboring
villages
through
medical
aid
and
he
agreed
with
the
missionaries
that
the
nawab
estate
was
just
what
was
needed
to
carry
out
their
plans
he
therefore
arranged
that
thomas
should
go
to
rampore
and
in
a
personal
interview
represent
to
the
nawab
his
desire
to
procure
a
portion
of
his
estate
in
bareilly
which
adjoined
the
mission
property
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
hospital
for
women
accordingly
on
receiving
an
intimation
that
the
nawab
would
receive
them
on
october
and
thomas
and
swain
set
out
for
this
momentous
interview
an
interesting
description
of
this
visit
is
given
in
gracey
book
medical
work
in
foreign
lands
and
in
swain
book
a
glimpse
of
india
thomas
carefully
prepared
hindustani
speech
was
not
finished
before
the
nawab
replied
graciously
take
it
it
is
yours
i
give
it
to
you
with
great
pleasure
for
such
a
purpose
thomas
naively
wrote
we
were
so
amazed
at
the
readiness
and
graciousness
of
the
gift
that
we
nearly
forgot
to
make
our
salaams
and
express
our
thanks
and
gratitude
the
nawab
replied
that
there
were
two
great
merits
in
this
gift
one
for
himself
and
one
for
thomas
for
taking
so
great
interest
in
the
charitable
work
thomas
then
asked
permission
to
found
the
first
hospital
for
women
in
india
in
his
highness
name
to
which
he
replied
you
think
proper
so
do
so
his
highness
mahomed
kallub
ali
khan
bahadur
nawab
of
rampore
has
the
honor
of
making
the
first
generous
contribution
toward
founding
the
woman
hospital
in
his
highness
again
expressed
the
satisfaction
he
felt
in
bestowing
this
gift
and
said
he
would
send
his
general
to
bareilly
on
monday
to
make
out
the
papers
and
put
us
in
formal
possession
of
the
property
before
the
party
left
the
nawab
dominions
the
ladies
were
asked
to
see
a
sick
woman
in
the
tahsildar
house
and
they
found
her
very
ill
indeed
swain
prescribed
for
her
and
for
several
others
who
asked
for
medicines
then
they
returned
to
the
rest
house
to
get
their
breakfast
and
talk
over
the
interview
and
to
thank
god
for
his
great
bounty
to
the
mission
work
thomas
wrote
we
were
bewildered
and
overwhelmed
to
think
that
the
possessions
which
we
had
longed
and
prayed
for
these
many
years
were
ours
the
gift
came
to
us
so
freely
and
in
such
a
way
that
we
could
take
no
credit
to
ourselves
for
having
obtained
it
like
all
god
free
gifts
it
was
given
before
asked
for
no
persuasions
or
arguments
of
ours
would
have
made
any
difference
god
saw
our
need
and
supplied
it
the
estate
consisted
of
forty
acres
of
land
a
fine
old
kothi
or
mansion
and
an
extensive
garden
the
house
needed
repairs
which
were
soon
completed
and
swain
and
miss
sparkes
who
had
been
appointed
to
take
charge
of
the
orphanage
moved
into
their
new
home
january
a
part
of
the
house
was
used
for
a
dispensary
until
other
arrangements
could
be
made
and
then
followed
busy
and
often
weary
days
borne
with
patience
however
for
the
work
was
for
the
master
the
and
dispensary
building
was
completed
in
may
and
the
hospital
buildings
connected
with
it
received
the
first
indoor
patients
january
from
that
time
on
there
was
no
lack
of
occupants
for
the
rooms
in
the
published
collection
of
her
letters
entitled
a
glimpse
of
india
swain
gives
a
graphic
picture
of
the
buildings
their
occupants
and
their
mode
of
life
visits
to
homes
in
the
city
were
continued
and
swain
and
her
assistants
were
fully
occupied
every
day
three
of
the
graduates
of
the
medical
class
were
employed
by
swain
as
bible
women
and
gave
much
assistance
in
the
religious
work
connected
with
the
hospital
first
furlough
the
anxiety
and
the
responsibility
of
the
rapidly
increasing
work
brought
weariness
of
mind
and
body
and
in
march
swain
returned
to
america
for
a
much
needed
rest
this
was
extended
to
the
autumn
of
when
on
september
she
again
sailed
for
india
arriving
in
bombay
november
at
the
conference
held
in
cawnpore
in
january
swain
received
her
appointment
to
bareilly
and
with
gladness
of
heart
took
up
her
old
work
physician
to
the
rani
of
khetri
in
march
swain
received
a
call
to
a
native
state
to
attend
the
wife
of
the
rajah
and
after
two
weeks
of
successful
treatment
she
was
formally
requested
to
remain
as
physician
to
the
rani
and
the
ladies
of
the
palace
after
much
thought
and
prayer
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
lord
will
that
she
should
remain
and
do
what
she
could
for
him
in
this
place
where
there
were
no
christian
influences
so
she
consented
to
the
proposal
on
condition
that
she
and
her
companion
be
allowed
to
carry
on
the
work
as
christians
should
to
this
the
rajah
agreed
and
swain
signed
a
contract
to
remain
two
years
in
the
blue
book
or
administration
report
of
the
khetri
state
the
rajah
wrote
i
can
not
look
back
with
greater
pleasure
or
satisfaction
on
anything
i
have
done
than
on
the
facilities
introduced
by
me
for
rendering
medical
aid
to
the
female
portion
of
my
subjects
it
is
a
patent
fact
that
the
indian
woman
secluded
as
she
is
within
the
four
walls
of
the
zenana
can
not
fully
benefit
by
any
system
of
medicine
and
it
was
not
till
the
generous
efforts
of
lady
dufferin
were
turned
in
this
direction
that
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
richest
and
most
enlightened
indians
enjoyed
a
better
position
than
the
lowest
and
meanest
of
their
fellows
it
therefore
gives
me
genuine
pleasure
to
bring
prominently
to
your
notice
the
existence
of
a
regular
institution
in
this
benighted
portion
of
india
for
the
treatment
of
females
of
all
classes
i
have
employed
a
very
competent
european
lady
doctor
miss
swain
to
attend
on
her
highness
the
rani
sahiba
and
feeling
it
my
duty
to
place
her
advice
and
assistance
within
the
reach
of
all
my
subjects
have
established
a
regular
dispensary
for
women
it
was
opened
june
at
the
expense
of
the
state
and
a
room
in
the
palace
building
appropriated
to
it
until
a
more
convenient
and
suitable
one
could
be
provided
an
allowance
of
rs
per
mensem
is
fixed
for
medicines
and
is
found
for
the
present
to
be
sufficient
the
average
daily
attendance
at
the
dispensary
is
five
under
section
schools
this
report
is
given
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
people
of
my
state
are
beginning
to
evince
greater
interest
in
the
education
of
their
children
than
they
have
done
before
the
greatest
desire
of
her
highness
the
rani
sahiba
was
that
i
should
make
suitable
provision
for
the
education
of
girls
i
accordingly
engaged
a
competent
european
lady
miss
pannell
as
mistress
and
the
khetri
girls
school
was
opened
by
her
highness
in
april
in
the
teeth
of
opposition
from
the
orthodox
portion
of
the
community
as
was
expected
at
first
every
effort
to
teach
these
girls
was
frowned
upon
and
considered
absurd
by
their
relatives
and
friends
this
feeling
however
gradually
gave
place
to
trust
and
confidence
and
the
school
is
now
showing
some
return
for
all
the
time
and
patience
spent
upon
it
the
number
of
pupils
on
the
roll
is
twenty
of
which
three
have
gone
to
their
husband
home
and
three
attend
only
occasionally
the
average
attendance
of
fourteen
girls
has
however
been
regular
great
pains
has
been
taken
to
teach
truthfulness
honesty
and
love
for
one
another
instruction
is
also
given
in
needlework
of
various
kinds
and
other
things
the
knowledge
of
which
is
necessary
for
good
housekeeping
the
improvement
made
by
some
of
the
girls
in
this
direction
may
at
once
be
noticed
by
a
change
in
the
manner
of
doing
nicely
the
little
things
which
go
to
make
up
their
lives
the
school
owes
its
existence
to
the
care
of
her
highness
who
is
much
interested
in
it
in
addition
to
her
school
miss
pannell
was
engaged
to
teach
the
rani
and
some
of
the
court
ladies
swain
and
miss
pannell
were
the
only
christians
in
the
state
but
their
little
sunday
service
conducted
for
their
servants
gained
attention
and
others
asked
to
be
allowed
to
attend
some
becoming
so
much
interested
that
they
procured
bibles
and
testaments
that
they
might
read
the
wonderful
words
themselves
a
supply
of
tracts
and
portions
of
scripture
was
always
on
hand
to
distribute
whenever
and
wherever
the
ladies
felt
they
would
be
appreciated
second
furlough
the
serious
illness
of
one
of
swain
sisters
decided
her
to
return
to
america
and
she
left
khetri
in
march
having
spent
nearly
three
years
in
seed
sowing
as
she
called
it
her
own
health
too
demanded
a
change
and
in
company
with
a
most
congenial
missionary
friend
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
homeland
she
returned
to
india
in
company
with
the
same
congenial
friend
in
time
to
attend
the
north
india
conference
before
going
to
her
khetri
home
miss
pannell
again
accompanying
her
return
to
khetri
the
isolation
of
their
life
in
khetri
had
been
at
times
a
great
trial
to
both
swain
and
miss
pannell
but
they
felt
that
they
were
where
god
wanted
them
to
be
and
bore
their
privations
bravely
however
at
this
time
swain
wrote
after
eighteen
months
of
the
religious
life
of
america
and
the
many
precious
privileges
enjoyed
there
it
seems
harder
to
settle
down
to
the
life
here
i
miss
the
church
services
much
more
than
i
did
when
i
was
here
before
at
another
time
she
wrote
i
have
sometimes
felt
tempted
to
give
up
my
work
here
but
then
the
thought
comes
to
me
that
i
can
do
more
by
remaining
here
and
paying
the
salary
of
a
native
preacher
to
do
what
i
should
never
be
able
to
do
a
second
princess
had
been
born
during
swain
absence
from
khetri
this
occasioned
close
attendance
at
the
palace
as
the
baby
was
delicate
and
swain
had
an
opportunity
for
bible
study
with
the
rani
who
enjoyed
nothing
more
than
an
hour
of
daily
study
of
the
scriptures
the
older
princess
too
was
ready
with
a
new
bible
verse
every
day
and
a
sunday
service
was
held
in
the
rani
apartments
at
which
the
women
of
the
court
and
their
attendants
were
present
the
sunday
bible
class
at
the
home
was
not
neglected
it
increased
in
interest
and
numbers
some
of
the
more
intelligent
of
the
rajah
staff
occasionally
joining
the
company
and
listening
with
interest
to
the
hymns
and
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
the
birth
of
the
prince
and
heir
in
january
was
a
time
of
great
rejoicing
and
much
ceremony
offerings
were
made
to
the
deities
day
after
day
the
poor
were
fed
and
presents
given
to
the
brahmans
the
rani
acknowledged
her
thankfulness
to
god
by
a
donation
in
the
name
of
her
little

old
scenes
in
india
rejoicing
in
the
great
advance
in
numbers
intelligence
and
spirituality

native
christians
and
had
the
great
pleasure
of
meeting
again
the
young
prince
of
khetri
and
his
sisters
now
orphans
and
of
hearing
from
them
of
their
mother

two
friends
should
occupy
rooms
in
her
lovely
cottage
brookside
opposite
the
sanitarium
grounds
where
for
nearly
three
years
they
enjoyed
the
comforts
of
a
home
and
of
congenial
society
though
living
outside
the
institution
they
took
their
meals
with
the
sanitarium
family
and
took
part
in
the
daily
morning
prayer
service
in
the
helpers
and
the
service
for
patients
and
guests
in
the
large
parlors
enjoying
to
the
full
the
spiritual
atmosphere
of
the
place
there
were
quiet
hours
of
delightful
study
in
the
book
which
each
had
made
the
guide
of
her
life
social
afternoons
with
friends
from
different
parts
of
the
country
and
from
over
the
seas
who
were
taking
a
in
the
lovely
village
and
pleasant
evenings
before
the
cheerful
grate
fire
in
swain
room
these
were
made
more
heartsome
one
autumn
because
of
the
presence
of
a
missionary
friend
miss
knowles
from
india
and
of
miss
mcfarland
swain
dear
friend
of
canandaigua
days
who
had
come
to
spend
a
little
time
with
the
one
whose
companionship
had
always
been
a
pleasure
and
whose
correspondence
during
her
absence
from
america
had
been
a
delight
a
glimpse
of
india
relatives
and
friends
of
swain
had
carefully
preserved
many
of
her
letters
and
greene
who
had
long
desired
that
these
letters
should
be
published
conceived
that
the
favorable
time
had
come
and
urged
the
immediate
preparation
of
the
work
the
letters
were
read
extracts
made
compiled
and
edited
and
in
the
summer
of
a
glimpse
of
india
was
given
to
the
public
this
furnished
a
most
interesting
record
of
the
busy
life
of
the
first
medical
missionary
to
the
women
of
the
orient
as
long
as
swain
was
able
she
attended
the
sunday
morning
service
and
the
thursday
evening
prayer
meeting
as
well
as
the
meetings
of
the
missionary
and
the
ladies
aid
societies
of
the
church
when
she
was
no
longer
equal
to
the
walk
to
church
she
and
her
friend
had
regular
sunday
morning
service
in
their
room
with
hymns
scripture
reading
prayer
and
a
sermon
and
were
often
present
in
spirit
at
the
midweek
prayer
meeting
though
their
prayers
and
praises
were
uttered
in
their
room
the
last
year
of
her
life
the
last
year
of
swain
life
was
spent
in
much
weakness
at
times
occasioned
by
an
attack
of
grippe
which
would
not
be
overcome
but
it
was
not
until
the
first
week
in
december
that
she
felt
that
she
could
not
hope
to
get
stronger
when
confined
to
her
bed
she
kept
her
testament
and
psalms
near
her
and
though
seldom
able
to
read
more
than
a
verse
she
enjoyed
the
daily
morning
bible
reading
and
prayer
with
her
friend
loving
attendance
and
the
best
medical
care
were
given
her
but
nought
availed
and
early
christmas
morning
while
sleeping
she
passed
from
earth
to
her
father
home
above
she
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
beautiful
cemetery
at
castile
december
the
prayer
of
the
frail
little
mother
of
a
frail
little
daughter
was
fully
answered
in
this
good
and
useful
life
