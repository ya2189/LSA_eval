in

and
whose
earnestness
and

have

a

to
be

this
book
is
affectionately
inscribed
preface
the
thought
constantly
in
mind
in
the
preparation
of
this
book
has
been
to
furnish
useful
material
in
usable
form
attention
is
invited
to
the
scope
of
the
work
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
not
a
mere
abstract
of
it
but
a
careful
study
of
the
text
is
properly
given
much
space
but
is
not
allowed
a
monopoly
of
it
each
of
our
governmental
institutions
deserves
and
receives
a
share
of
consideration
the
order
of
presentation
beginning
with
the
town
where
the
student
can
observe
the
operations
of
government
and
proceeding
gradually
to
the
consideration
of
government
in
general
is
based
upon
conclusions
reached
during
eighteen
years
of
experience
in
teaching
this
subject
matter
to
be
used
chiefly
for
reference
is
placed
in
the
appendix
attention
is
asked
to
the
amount
of
information
which
by
means
of
tabulations
and
other
modes
of
condensation
is
therein
contained
documents
easily
obtainable
such
as
the
declaration
of
independence
are
omitted
to
make
room
for
typical
and
other
interesting
documents
not
usually
accessible
is
this
book
intended
to
be
an
manual
no
but
it
intended
to
help
students
to
get
an
insight
into
the
way
in
which
public
business
is
carried
on
is
it
designed
as
an
elementary
treatise
on
law
no
but
the
hope
is
indulged
that
the
young
people
who
study
it
will
catch
something
of
the
of

to

kindly

meant
to
be
helpful
for
such
these
words
are
intended
the
local
organizations
are
so
related
that
it
is
advisable
for
all
classes
to
consider
each
of
them
especial
attention
should
however
be
given
to
the
organization
town
village
or
city
in
which
the
school
is
here
considerable
time
can
be
profitably
spent
and
the
matter
in
the
book
may
be
much
amplified
here
must
be
laid
the
basis
of
future
study
certain
typical
instruments
deserve
careful
study
for
a
student
to
have
made
out
understandingly
an
official
bond
for
instance
is
for
him
to
have
gained
greatly
in
intelligence
it
will
be
of
great
advantage
to
the
class
for
the
teacher
to
have
a
complete
set
of
the
papers
whose
forms
are
given
in
appendix
a
these
may
be
obtained
at
almost
any
newspaper
office
at
a
cost
of
about
cents
a
or
series
of
envelopes
in
which
to
file
newspaper
clippings
illustrative
of
the
workings
of
government
may
be
made
very
useful
pupils
should
be
permitted
and
encouraged
to
contribute
one
good
way
to
review
is
for
the
teacher
to
give
out
say
once
in
two
weeks
a
set
of
or
more
questions
each
of
which
may
be
answered
in
a
few
words
have
the
pupils
write
their
answers
and
the
correct
answers
being
given
by
teacher
or
pupils
each
may
mark
his
own
paper
each
pupil
may
thus
discover
where
he
is
strong
and
where
weak
the
questions
given
for
debate
may
be
discussed
by
the
literary
society
or
for
morning
exercises
one
student
may
on
a
certain
day
present
one
side
of
the
argument
and
on
the
following
day
the
negative
may
be
brought
out
by
another
student
a
student
should
not
be
required
to
submit
his
good
name
to
the
chances
of
answering
a
certain
set
of
questions
however
excellent
at
the
examination
when
from
anxiety
or
other
causes
he
may
fall
far
short
of
doing
himself
justice
one
good
plan
is
to
allow
each
student
to
make
up
percent
of
his
record
during
the
progress
of
the
work
by
bringing
in
say
five
carefully
prepared
papers
one
of
these
may
be
a
of
matter
pertaining
to
his
local
organization
another
may
be
an
account
of
a
trial
observed
or
other
governmental
work
which
the
student
may
have
seen
performed
a
third
may
be
a
synopsis
of
the
president
message
the
fourth
a
general
tabulation
of
the
constitution
the
fifth
a
review
of
some
book
on
government
or
a
paper
on
a
subject
of
the
student
own
choice
among
reference
books
every
school
should
have
at
least
the
revised
statutes
of
the
state
and
of
the
united
states
the
legislative
manual
of
the
state
a
good
political
almanac
for
the
current
year
the
congressional
directory
and
alton
among
the
lawmakers
a
teachers
manual
giving
answers
to
the
pertinent
questions
contained
herein
and
many
useful
hints
as
to
the
details
of
teaching
civics
is
published
in
connection
with
this
book
to
students
you
will
notice
in
chapter
one
that
at
the
close
of
nearly
every
paragraph
questions
are
thrown
in
they
are
inserted
to
help
you
cultivate
in
yourself
the
very
valuable
habit
of
rigid
we
are
all
liable
to
assume
too
soon
that
we
have
the
thought
not
to
mar
the
look
of
the
page
the
questions
are
thenceforward
placed
only
at
the
close
of
the
chapters
you
will
soon
discover
that
these
questions
are
so
framed
as
to
require
you
to
read
not
only
on
the
lines
and
them
but
also
right
down
them
even
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
answer
all
of
the
questions
the
information
may
not
be
in
the
book
at
all
you
may
have
to
look
around
a
long
time
for
the
answer
if
you
occasionally
come
to
a
question
which
you
can
neither
answer
nor
dismiss
from
your
mind
be
thankful
for
the
question
and
that
you
are
bright
enough
to
be
affected
in
this
way
you
have
doubtless
discovered
that
some
of
your
best
intellectual
work
your
most
fruitful
study
has
been
done
on
just
such
questions
after
studying
a
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
you
should
be
able
to
answer
these
four
questions
what
does
it
what
does
it
was
the
provision
inserted
how
is
it
carried
into
practical
effect
some
of
the
provisions
should
be
so
thoroughly
committed
to
memory
that
at
any
time
they
may
be
accurately
quoted
the
ability
to
quote
exactly
is
an
accomplishment
well
worth
acquiring
after
you
have
got
through
with
a
line
of
investigation
it
is
a
good
thing
to
make
a
synopsis
of
the
conclusions
reached
hints
are
given
at
appropriate
places
as
to
how
this
may
be
done
but
the
doing
of
it
is
left
to
you
that
you
may
have
the
pleasure
and
profit
resulting
therefrom
finally
without
fretting
yourself
unnecessarily
be
possessed
of
a
noble
dissatisfaction
with
vague
try
to
see
clearly
government
is
so
much
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
you
can
assuredly
understand
much
of
it
if
you
determine
so
to
do
studies
in
civics
preliminary
chapter
government
what
it
is
and
why
it
is
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
study
two
questions
naturally
present
themselves
first
what
is
government
second
why
do
we
have
such
a
thing
these
questions
are
much
easier
to
ask
than
to
answer
the
wisest
men
of
the
ages
have
pondered
upon
them
and
their
answers
have
varied
widely
yet
we
need
not
despair
even
boys
and
girls
can
work
out
moderately
good
answers
if
they
will
approach
the
questions
seriously
and
with
a
determination
to
get
as
near
the
root
of
the
matter
as
possible
beginning
without
attempting
an
exact
definition
of
government
because
we
all
have
a
notion
of
what
it
is
we
notice
that
only
certain
animals
are
among
these
may
be
mentioned
the
ant
the
bee
and
man
the
fox
the
bear
and
the
lion
represent
the
other
class
if
we
should
make
two
lists
including
in
one
all
the
animals
of
the
first
class
and
in
the
other
all
those
of
the
second
class
we
should
make
this
discovery
that
animals
are
those
which
by
nature
live
together
in
companies
while
the
other
class
as
a
rule
live
apart
the
generalization
reached
is
that
gregarious
animals
form
we
would
discover
upon
further
investigation
that
the
greater
the
interdependence
of
the
individuals
the
more
complex
the
government
confining
our
attention
now
to
man
whose
government
is
the
most
complex
we
may
put
our
generalization
into
this
form
man
establishes
government
because
nature
he
is
a
social
this
may
be
taken
as
the
fundamental
reason
let
us
now
proceed
to
trace
the
relation
between
cause
and
effect
in
order
that
people
may
go
from
place
to
place
to
meet
others
for
pleasure
or
business
roads
are
needed
some
of
these
roads
may
cross
streams
too
deep
for
fording
so
bridges
must
be
provided
these
things
are
for
the
good
of
all
they
are
public
needs
and
should
be
provided
by
the
public
but
what
is
every
body
business
is
nobody
business
it
follows
that
the
public
must
appoint
certain
persons
to
look
after
such
things
by
the
act
of
appointing
these
persons
society
becomes
to
that
extent
organized
we
see
then
that
society
organizes
in
order
to
provide
certain
public
improvements
carry
on
certain
public
for
his
own
preservation
man
is
endowed
with
another
quality
namely
selfishness
sometimes
this
is
so
strong
in
a
person
as
to
cause
him
to
disregard
the
rights
of
others
by
experience
man
has
learned
that
person
is
interested
in
seeing
that
conflicting
claims
are
settled
on
a
better
basis
than
that
of
the
relative
strength
of
the
contestants
in
other
words
all
are
interested
in
the
prevalence
of
peace
and
the
rightful
settlement
of
disputes
that
this
work
may
surely
be
done
it
is
obvious
that
society
must
appoint
certain
persons
to
attend
to
it
that
is
society
organizes
establish
communities
take
their
character
from
that
of
the
individuals
composing
them
therefore
communities
are
selfish
a
third
reason
appears
then
for
the
organization
of
society
namely
common
but
this
organization
of
society
is
the
very
thing
that
we
call
government
we
may
therefore
answer
the
two
questions
proposed
at
the
beginning
in
this
way
is
the
organization
of
society
to
carry
on
public
works
to
establish
justice
and
to
provide
for
the
common
the
term
is
also
applied
to
the
body
of
persons
into
whose
hands
is
committed
the
management
of
public
affairs
to
show
that
government
is
a
necessity
to
man
let
us
imagine
a
company
of
several
hundred
men
women
and
children
who
have
left
their
former
home
on
account
of
the
tyranny
of
the
government
so
harshly
have
they
been
treated
that
they
have
ascribed
all
their
misery
to
the
thing
called
government
and
they
resolve
that
they
will
have
none
in
their
new
home
they
discover
an
island
in
the
ocean
which
seems
never
to
have
been
occupied
and
which
appears
a
goodly
land
here
they
resolve
to
settle
they
help
each
other
in
building
the
houses
each
takes
from
the
forest
the
wood
that
he
needs
for
fuel
they
graze
the
cattle
in
a
common
meadow
they
till
a
common
field
and
all
share
in
the
harvest
for
a
time
all
goes
well
but
mutterings
begin
to
be
heard
it
is
found
that
some
are
unwilling
to
do
their
share
of
the
work
it
becomes
manifest
to
the
thoughtful
that
community
of
property
must
be
given
up
and
private
ownership
be
introduced
or
else
that
the
common
work
must
be
regulated
in
the
latter
case
government
is
established
by
the
very
act
of
regulation
they
are
establishing
justice
if
they
resolve
to
adopt
private
ownership
industry
will
diversify
they
will
begin
to
spread
out
over
the
island
and
public
improvements
will
be
needed
such
as
those
specified
above
the
conflict
of
interests
will
soon
necessitate
tribunals
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
and
thus
government
would
in
either
case
inevitably
be
established
a
visit
from
savages
inhabiting
another
island
would
show
the
utility
of
the
organization
for
common
defense
thus
government
seems
a
necessary
consequence
of
man
nature
in
this
country
we
have
the
general
government
and
state
governments
the
latter
acting
chiefly
through
local
organizations
for
obvious
reasons
the
common
defense
is
vested
in
the
general
government
for
reasons
that
will
appear
most
of
the
work
of
public
improvement
and
establishing
justice
is
entrusted
to
the
state
and
local
governments
these
we
shall
now
proceed
to
study
beginning
at
home
would
government
be
necessary
if
man
were
morally
perfect
why
is
this
organization
of
society
called
part
i
government
within
the
state
chapter
i
the
town
why
and
how
organized
officers
town
business
now
instead
of
a
company
going
to
an
island
to
found
new
homes
let
us
think
of
immigrants
to
a
new
part
of
a
state
like
the
people
on
the
island
they
will
need
roads
bridges
and
schools
and
they
will
desire
to
preserve
the
local
peace
hence
they
too
will
need
to
organize
as
a
political
body
since
these
people
are
going
to
meet
at
stated
periods
to
agree
upon
the
amounts
to
be
put
into
public
improvements
and
to
select
officers
to
carry
out
their
wishes
the
territory
covered
by
the
organization
should
not
be
very
large
it
should
be
of
such
a
size
that
every
one
entitled
to
do
so
can
reach
the
place
of
meeting
take
part
in
the
work
thereof
and
return
home
the
same
day
even
if
he
has
no
team
will
anything
be
found
already
done
to
facilitate
matters
yes
those
parts
of
the
state
open
to
settlement
will
be
found
surveyed
into
portions
six
miles
square
these
squares
are
called
in
the
survey
townships
plainly
indicating
that
they
were
meant
by
the
general
government
to
be
convenient
bases
for
the
organization
of
towns
and
they
have
been
so
accepted
draw
a
township
subdivide
it
into
sections
and
number
them
in
accordance
with
the
survey
subdivide
a
section
into
forties
and
describe
each
forty
why
do
we
have
such
divisions
of
a
township
locate
your
farm
what
is
the
difference
between
a
and
a
footnote
in
some
states
the
terms
congressional
township
and
civil
township
are
used
corporate
a
town
is
in
some
respects
like
an
individual
it
can
sue
and
be
sued
it
can
borrow
money
it
can
buy
or
rent
property
needed
for
public
purposes
and
it
can
sell
property
for
which
it
has
no
further
use
because
a
town
can
do
these
things
as
an
individual
can
it
is
called
a
corporation
and
such
powers
are
called
corporate
powers
when
we
say
that
the
town
can
do
these
things
we
mean
of
course
that
the
people
of
the
town
as
a
political
body
can
do
them
through
the
proper
officers
officers
the
town
needs
one
or
more
persons
to
act
for
it
in
its
corporate
capacity
and
to
have
general
charge
of
its
interests
should
there
be
one
or
more
than
one
why
how
many
are
there
every
business
transaction
should
be
recorded
and
the
town
should
have
a
recording
officer
or
secretary
what
is
the
recording
officer
in
this
town
called
what
is
his
name
which
officer
would
naturally
be
the
custodian
of
public
papers
it
takes
money
to
build
bridges
and
to
carry
on

is
in

how

them
differences
about

have
it
duly
signed
and
posted
in

season
present
it
to
the

who
were
elected
at
your

meeting
the
supervisors
after
examining
the
petition
carefully
and
being
sure
that
it
is
in
proper
form
and
that
it
has
been
duly
posted
will
appoint
a
time
and
place
of
hearing
and
give
due
notice
thereof
when
the
day
of
hearing
arrives
they
will
examine
the
proofs
of
the
posting
and
service
of
the
notices
of
hearing
before
proceeding
to
act
upon
the
petition
having
heard
arguments
for
and
against
the
laying
of
the
road
the
supervisors
will
render
their
decision
in
due
form
in
awarding
damages
the
supervisors
will
probably
find
four
classes
of
persons
first
those
to
whom
the
road
is
of
as
much
benefit
as
damage
and
who
admit
the
fact
second
those
who
should
have
damages
and
are
reasonable
in
their
demands
third
those
who
claim
more
damages
than
they
are
in
the
judgment
of
the
supervisors
entitled
to
and
fourth
those
who
from
some
cause
absence
perhaps
do
not
present
any
claim
from
the
first
class
the
supervisors
can
readily
get
a
release
of
damages
with
the
second
they
can
easily
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
damages
to
the
third
and
fourth
they
must
make
an
award
of
damages
let
all
of
these
cases
arise
and
be
taken
care
of
the
supervisors
must
be
careful
to
issue
their
road
order
in
proper
form
and
to
see
that
the
order
together
with
the
petition
notices
affidavits
and
awards
of
damages
are
filed
correctly
and
on
time
the
town
clerk
must
read
the
law
carefully
to
ascertain
his
duty
and
then
perform
it
exactly
see
that
fences
are
ordered
to
be
removed
let
one
of
the
persons
who
feels
himself
aggrieved
by
the
decision
of
the
supervisors
appeal
to
a
proper
court
let
this
be
done
in
due
form
as
each
step
is
taken
let
the
reasons
for
it
be
made
clear
maintaining

the

primitive
modes
of
administering
justice
trial
by
boys
settle
some
matters
about
which
they
can
not
agree
by
tossing
up
a
penny
or
by
drawing
cuts
in
a
game
of
ball
they
determine
first
innings
by
tossing
the
bat
differences
in
a
game
of
marbles
they
settle
by
guessing
odd
or
even
or
by
trying
it
over
to
prove
it
in
all
these
modes
of
adjustment
there
is
an
appeal
to
probably
behind
these
practices
is
the
feeling
that
the
boy
who
ought
to
win
will
somehow
guess
right
this
appealing
to
chance
to
settle
questions
of
fact
is
characteristic
of
society
in
its
primitive
state
modes
of
establishing
justice
similar
in
principle
to
these
boy
practices
prevail
to
this
day
among
superstitious
peoples
they
have
prevailed
even
in
europe
not
only
among
people
of
low
mental
power
but
also
among
the
cultured
greeks
among
our
own
saxon
ancestors
the
following
modes
of
trial
are
known
to
have
been
used
a
person
accused
of
crime
was
required
to
walk
blindfolded
and
barefoot
over
a
piece
of
ground
on
which
hot
ploughshares
lay
at
unequal
distances
or
to
plunge
his
arm
into
hot
water
if
in
either
case
he
escaped
unhurt
he
was
declared
innocent
this
was
called
trial
by
ordeal
the
theory
was
that
providence
would
protect
the
innocent
trial
by
sometimes
boys
settle
their
disputes
by
this
too
was
one
of
the
modes
of
adjudication
prevalent
in
early
times
among
men
trial
by
battle
was
introduced
into
england
by
the
normans
it
was
the
last
and
most
solemn
resort
to
try
titles
to
real
estate
footnote
dole
talks
about
law
p
the
duel
remained
until
recently
and
indeed
yet
remains
in
some
countries
as
a
reminder
of
that
time
and
disputes
between
countries
are
even
now
almost
without
exception
settled
by
an
appeal
to
arms
perhaps
the
thought
is
that
he
is
thrice
armed
that
hath
his
quarrel
just
sometimes
when
one
of
the
boys
is
too
small
to
fight
for
his
rights
another
boy
will
take
his
part
and
fight
in
his
stead
similarly
in
the
trial
by
battle
the
parties
could
fight
personally
or
by
champion
interesting
accounts
of
this
mode
of
trial
are
given
by
green
and
blackstone
and
in
scott
talisman
two
boys
who
have
a
difference
may
leave
it
to
some
other
boy
in
whom
they
both
have
confidence
and
men
did
and
do
settle
disputes
in
a
similar
way
they
call
it
settlement
by
arbitration
a
boy
would
hardly
refer
a
matter
for
decision
to
his
little
brother
why
still
another
common
way
for
two
boys
to
decide
a
question
about
which
they
differ
is
to
leave
it
to
the
boys
some
of
whom
are
knowing
to
the
facts
and
others
not
each
of
the
disputants
tells
his
story
subject
to
more
or
less
interruption
and
calls
upon
other
boys
to
corroborate
his
statements
the
assembled
company
then
decides
the
matter
renders
its
verdict
and
if
necessary
carries
it
into
execution
in
this
procedure
the
boys
are
the
scenes
of
the
or
town
meeting
of
our
saxon
ancestors
let
us
look
at
this
again
to
discover
its
principal
elements
in
the
first
place
we
see
that
boy
in
the
crowd
feels
that
he
has
a
right
to
assist
in
arriving
at
the
decision
that
the
boys
collectively
are
to
settle
the
matter
in
other
words
that
establishment
of
justice
is
a
public
so
our
saxon
forefathers
used
to
come
together
in
the
and
as
a
body
decide
differences
between
man
and
man
the
boys
have
no
special
persons
to
perform
special
duties
that
is
no
court
officers
neither
at
first
did
those
old
saxons
secondly
in
the
the
in
the
case
are
brought
out
by
means
of
so
it
was
in
the
and
so
it
is
in
most
civilized
countries
today
among
those
old
saxons
the
custom
grew
up
of
allowing
the
facts
in
the
case
to
be
determined
by
men
of
the
neighborhood
were
most
intimately
acquainted
with
those
when
they
came
over
to
england
these
saxons
brought
this
custom
with
them
and
from
it
has
been
developed
the
trial
by
jury
the
colonists
of
this
country
most
of
whom
came
from
england
brought
with
them
this
important
element
in
the
establishment
of
justice
and
it
is
found
today
in
nearly
all
the
states
again
when
in
the
the
facts
of
the
case
have
been
established
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
apply
the
rules
of
the
game
to
the
particular
case
the
boys
frequently
invariably
in
difficult
cases
turn
to
some
boy
or
boys
known
to
be
well
versed
in
the
principles
of
the
game
and
defer
to
his
or
their
opinion
and
similarly
in
the
much
deference
was
paid
in
rendering
judgment
to
the
old
men
who
for
many
years
had
helped
to
render
justice
and
who
in
consequence
had
much
knowledge
of
the
customs
unwritten
laws
in
accordance
with
which
decisions
were
rendered
in
this
deference
to
one
or
more
persons
who
are
recognized
as
understanding
the
principles
involved
in
the
case
we
see
the
germ
of
in
our
present
courts
and
finally
a
boy
naturally
reserves
the
right
mentally
or
avowedly
of
from
the
decision
of
the
boys
to
the
teacher
or
his
father
in
case
he
feels
that
he
has
been
unjustly
dealt
with
thus
we
see
that
the
principal
elements
of
the
courts
of
today
the
establishment
of
justice
as
a
public
trust
the
determination
of
the
facts
by
means
of
witnesses
and
a
jury
the
application
of
the
law
by
one
or
more
judges
the
right
of
appeal
to
a
higher
court
are
not
artificial
but
in
the
nature
of
things
we
inherited
them
from
our
primitive
ancestors
and
in
that
sense
they
may
be
said
to
have
been
imposed
upon
us
but
their
naturalness
appears
in
the
fact
that
boys
when
left
to
themselves
introduce
the
same
elements
into
their
changes
made
in
course
of
time
in
the
jury
the
jurors
were
originally
as
has
been
said
persons
acquainted
with
the
facts
after
the
norman
conquest
it
came
about
that
the
jury
consisted
of
twelve
persons
disinterested
and
with
the
facts
probably
the
change
gradually
came
about
from
the
difficulty
of
getting
twelve
men
eligible
to
the
jury
who
knew
of
the
facts
persons
ineligible
to
the
jury
were
then
invited
to
give
it
information
but
not
to
join
it
in
the
verdict
the
next
step
taken
about
was
to
require
these
witnesses
to
give
their
evidence
in
open
court
subject
to
examination
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
however
was
still
merely
supplementary
then
in
the
time
of
queen
anne
about
it
was
decided
that
any
person
who
had
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
case
should
appear
as
a
that
the
jury
should
consist
of
persons
unacquainted
with
the
facts
and
that
the
verdict
should
be
rendered
in
accordance
with
the
evidence
and
so
it
is
to
this
day
both
in
england
and
america
footnote
the
best
history
of
the
jury
system
is
probably
forsyth
it
is
not
true
however
that
a
man
is
disqualified
from
serving
on
a
jury
simply
because
he
has
heard
or
read
of
the
case
and
has
formed
and
expressed
some
impression
in
regard
to
its
merits
if
it
were
the
qualifications
for
jury
service
in
cases
that
attract
great
attention
would
be
ignorance
and
stupidity
the
test
therefore
is
not
whether
the
juryman
is
entirely
ignorant
of
the
case
but
whether
he
has
formed
such
an
opinion
as
would
be
likely
to
prevent
him
from
impartially
weighing
the
evidence
and
returning
a
verdict
in
accordance
therewith

proceedings
in
a

court
i
in
ordinary
civil
actions
a
is
one
having
for
its
object
the
protection
or
enforcement
of
a
private
right
or
the
securing
of
compensation
for
an
infraction
thereof
for
instance
a
suit
brought
to
secure
possession
of
a
horse
or
to
secure
damages
for
a
trespass
is
a
civil
action
the
person
bringing
the
action
is
called
the
the
one
against
whom
it
is
brought
the
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
are
called
the
to
the
action
a
justice
of
the
peace
has
jurisdiction
within
the
county
in
most
civil
actions
when
the
amount
in
controversy
does
not
exceed
a
certain
sum
usually
one
hundred
dollars
see
p
preliminary
to
trial
and
in
bringing
a
civil
action
the
plaintiff
or
his
agent
appears
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
files
a
complaint
in
this
he
states
the
cause
of
the
action
the
justice
then
issues
a
summons
this
is
an
order
to
a
sheriff
or
constable
commanding
him
to
notify
the
defendant
to
appear
before
the
justice
at
a
certain
time
and
place
to
make
answer
to
the
plaintiff
demands
form
on
p
sometimes
on
bringing
an
action
or
during
its
progress
a
writ
of
attachment
is
obtained
to
secure
this
writ
the
creditor
must
make
affidavit
to
the
fact
of
the
debt
and
that
the
debtor
is
disposing
or
preparing
to
dispose
of
his
property
with
intent
to
defraud
him
or
that
the
debtor
is
himself
not
reachable
because
hiding
or
because
of

addition
the
creditor
must
give
a
bond
for
the
costs
of
the
suit
and
for
any
damages
sustained
by
the
defendant
the
justice
then
issues
the
writ
which
commands
the
sheriff
or
constable
to
take
possession
of
and
hold
sufficient
goods
of
the
debtor
and
summon
him
as
defendant
in
the
suit
another
writ
sometimes
used
is
the
writ
of
replevin
to
secure
this
writ
the
plaintiff
must
make
affidavit
that
the
defendant
is
in
wrongful
possession
of
certain
described
personal
property
belonging
to
the
plaintiff
the
plaintiff
then
gives
a
bond
for
the
costs
of
the
suit
and
for
the
return
of
the
property
in
case
he
fails
to
secure
judgment
and
for
the
payment
of
damages
if
the
return
of
the
property
can
not
be
enforced
and
the
justice
issues
the
writ
this
commands
the
sheriff
or
constable
to
take
the
property
described
and
turn
it
over
to
the
plaintiff
and
to
summon
the
defendant
as
before
the
next
step
in
the
process
in
any
of
the
cases
is
the
filing
of
an
answer
by
the
defendant
in
which
he
states
the
grounds
of
his
defense
the
complaint
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
answer
of
the
defendant
constitute
what
are
called
the
pleadings

vii
or

if
the
answer
contains

the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
a
further
pleading
called
the
reply
the
pleadings
contain
simply
a
statement
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
parties
rely
in
support
of
their
case
no
evidence
inference
or
argument
is
permitted
in
them
it
is
a
principle
of
pleading
that
everything
not
denied
is
presumed
to
be
admitted
the
fact
or
facts
asserted
by
one
party
and
denied
by
the
other
constitute
the
issue
if
the
defendant
does
not
make
answer
on
or
before
the
day
appointed
in
the
summons
and
does
not
appear
on
that
day
judgment
may
be
rendered

him

to
appear

loses
the
suit

costs

sufficient
cause
either
party
may
have
the
suit
adjourned
or
postponed
for
a
short
time
on
demand
of
either
party
a
jury
must
be
impaneled
the
jury
usually
consists
of
twelve
persons
but
by
consent
of
the
parties
the
number
may
be
less
the
jury
is
impaneled
as
follows

the

attorney
reads
the

and
makes
an
opening
statement
of
the
facts
which
he
expects
to
prove
the
purpose
of
the
opening
statement
is
to
present
the
salient
points
of
the
case
so
that
the
importance
and
bearing
of
the
testimony
may
be
readily
seen
by
the
jury
the
evidence

the
most
important
rules
of
evidence
are
given
in
chapter
vii
for
the
plaintiff
is
then
introduced
each
witness
after
being
duly
sworn
gives
his
testimony
by
answering
the
questions
of
counsel
after
the
direct
examination
by
the
attorney
the
witness
may
be
by
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
when
the
evidence
for
the
plaintiff
is
all
in
the
attorney
makes
his
opening
statement
and
then
the
witnesses
for
the
defense
are
examined
the
direct
examination
is
now
of
course
conducted
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
by
opposing
counsel
when
all
the
evidence
for
the
defense
has
been
introduced
the
plaintiff
may
offer
evidence
in
rebuttal
that
is
to
contradict
or
disprove
new
matter
adduced
by
the
defense

the
defendant
may
then
introduce
evidence
to
refute

first
brought
out
by
the
rebuttal
the
case
is
now
ready
for
argument
one
attorney
on
each
side
addresses
the
jury
each
tries
to
show
that
the
evidence
adduced
has
proved
the
facts
alleged
in
his
pleadings
and
each
asks
for
a
decision
in
favor
of
his
client
usually
the
side
upon
which
rests
the
burden
of
proof
has
the
closing
argument
counsel
must
confine
themselves
to
the
law
the
admitted
facts
and
the
evidence
the
jury
then
retire
in
care
of
an
officer
to
a
room
set
apart
for
their
use
here
they
deliberate
in
secret
if
after
a
reasonable
time
they
can
not
agree
they
are
discharged
and
the
case
stands
as
if
no
trial
had
taken
place
but
if
they
agree
they
return
to
the
court
room
and
render
their
verdict
this
is
given
by
the
foreman
and
is
assented
to
by
the
rest
after
the
verdict
the
justice
enters
judgment
in

therewith
judgment
may
include
certain
sums
of
money
allowed
to
the
successful
party
in
part
compensation
of
his
expenses
such
allowances
and
certain
court
expenses
are
called
the
costs
after
the
trial
if
the
defeated
party
feels
that
he
has
not
been
justly
dealt
with
he
may
ask
for
a
new
trial
if
this
be
refused
he
may
appeal
his
case
to
a
higher
court
he
must
make
affidavit
that
the
appeal
is
not
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
and
must
give
bonds
to
cover
the
judgment
and
the
costs
of
appeal
the
higher
court
affirms
or
reverses
the
judgment
in
the
latter

a
new
trial
sometimes
the

is
tried
anew
in

in
criminal
actions
justices
of

have
jurisdiction
throughout
their
respective
counties
as

charges

the
punishment
prescribed
by
law
does
not
exceed
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars
or
imprisonment
for
three
months

the

of

specified
above

to
dismiss
them
or
hold
them
for
trial
in
a
court
having
jurisdiction

the
facts
seem
to
warrant

requiring
reckless
persons
to
give
security

keep

trial
preliminary
if
a
crime
has
been
committed
the
sufferer
or
any
one
else
may
appear
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
make
complaint
under
oath
specifying
the
nature
of
the
crime
the
time
of
its
commission
and
the
name
of
the
person
believed
to
have
perpetrated
it
and
requesting
that
he
be
apprehended
for
trial
if
upon
careful
examination
of
the
complainant
and
any
witnesses
whom
he
may
bring
it
appears
that
the
offense
has
probably
been
committed
the
justice
issues
a
warrant
reciting
the
substance
of
the
complaint
and
commanding
an
officer
to
arrest
the
accused
and
produce
him
for
trial
the
officer
arrests
the
accused
brings
him
before
the
justice
and
makes
a
return
of
the
warrant
the
return
is
a
statement
on
the
back
of
the
warrant
telling
how
its
commands
have
been
executed
see
the
accused
is
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
but
if
for
good
cause
it
seems
best
to
postpone
it
the
accused
may
be
released
from
custody
upon
giving
sufficient
bail
for
his
appearance
at
the
time
fixed
for
trial
if
he
can
not
furnish
bail
he
is
committed
to
jail
or
left
in
charge
of
the
officer
one
good
reason
for
postponing
a
trial
is
to
enable
the
parties
to
secure
witnesses
to
this
end
the
justice
issues
subpoenas
but
in
this
case
the
witnesses
must
come
without
the
tender
of
the
fee
the
first
step
in
the
trial
proper
is
to
inform
the
defendant
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
the
accusation
as
stated
in
the
warrant
is
distinctly
read
to
him
by
the
justice
and
he
is
required
to
plead
thereto
if
he
pleads
guilty
conviction
and
sentence
may
follow
at
once
if
he
pleads
not
guilty
the
trial
proceeds
after
the
joining
of
issue
and
before
the
court
proceeds
to
the
examination
of
the
merits
of
the
case
a
jury
is
impaneled
as
in
a
civil
action
a
jury
may
be
waived
by
the
defendant
then
follow
the
taking
of
the
testimony
the
arguments
of
counsel
the
consideration
and
verdict
by
the
jury
the
defendant
is
then
discharged
if
not
guilty
or
sentenced
if
found
guilty
the
penalty
depends
of
course
upon
the
nature
of
the
offense
proceedings
in
examination
need
of
over
crimes
punishable
by
fine
greater
than
or
imprisonment
for
more
than
three
months
a
justice
of
the
peace
usually
has
no
jurisdiction
of
trial
the
action
must
be
tried
in
the
district
court
on
the
indictment
of
a
grand
jury
but
in
the
meantime
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
might
escape
to
prevent
this
the
accused
may
be
arrested
and
examined
by
a
justice
of
the
peace
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
grounds
for
holding
him
for
trial
the
preliminary
proceedings
are
precisely
like
those
in
case
of
a
trial
upon
complaint
duly
made
a
warrant
is
issued
and
the
accused
is
arrested
and
brought
before
the
justice
in
the
presence
of
the
accused
the
magistrate
examines
the
complainant
and
witnesses
in

the
prosecution

in
relation
to
any
matter
connected
with
such
charge
which
may
be
deemed
pertinent
rights
of

a
right

to
have
the
aid
of

may

the
prosecution
the
if
it
appears
upon
examination
that
the
accused
is
innocent
of
the
crime
he
is
discharged
if
his
guilt
seems
probable
he
is
held
to
await
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
case
of
some
offenses
bail
may
be
accepted
but
if
no
suitable
bail
is
offered
or
if
the
offense
is
not
bailable
the
accused
is
committed
to
jail

witnesses
for
the
prosecution
may
be
required
to
give
bonds
for
their
appearance
at
the
trial
or
in
default
thereof
may
be
committed
to
jail
the
justice
makes
a
report
of
the
proceedings
in
the
examination
and
files
it
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
before
which
the
accused
is
bound
to
appear
for
trial
proceedings
for
preventing
crime
but
it
is
better
to
prevent
crime
than
to
punish
it
indeed
one
reason
for
punishing
wrongdoers
is
that
the
fear
of
punishment
may
deter
people
from
committing
crime
as
a
conservator
of
the
public
peace
then
a
justice
may
require
persons
to
give
bonds
for
good
behavior
the
preliminary
proceedings
are
similar
to
those
in
the
case
of
a
trial
the
complaint
warrant
and
return
but
the
complainant
simply
alleges
upon
oath
that
a
crime
against
his
person
or
property
has
been
threatened
the
examination
is
conducted
as
in
case
of
a
criminal
offense
if
upon
examination
there
appears
reason
to
fear
that
the
crime
will
be
committed
by
the
party
complained
of
he
shall
be
required
to
enter
into
recognizance
to
keep
the
peace
failing
in
which
he
shall
be
committed
to
jail
for
the
time
to
be
covered
by
the
surety
said
time
not
to
exceed
six
months
remarks
on
criminal
trials
the
care
for
the
rights
of
the
accused
is
based
upon
the
principle
in
our
law
that
every
man
shall
be
held
innocent
till
guilty
another
principle
is

that

if

no

here
the
danger
is
such
that
all

chapter
the
city
need
a
village
being
one
election
district
has
only
one
polling
place
the
community
may
increase
so
in
numbers
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
have
several
voting
places
for
the
accommodation
of
the
people
these
would
naturally
be
located
in
different
parts
of
the
community
and
to
prevent
fraud
voting
precincts
would
have
to
be
carefully
defined
the
council
would
naturally
be
made
up
of
representatives
from
these
divisions
when
under
this
arrangement
the
voters
assemble
in
different
parts
of
the
community
they
could
not
listen
to
financial
reports
and
vote
taxes
as
they
do
in
the
town
and
the
village
hence
it
would
be
necessary
to
endow
the
council
with
increased
powers
including
the
power
to
levy
taxes
without
the
direct
authorization
of
the
people
the
expenses
for
public
improvements
for
waterworks
sewers
may
take
more
money
than
it
would
be
prudent
to
assess
upon
the
community
for
immediate
payment
in
this
case
it
would
be
desirable
for
the
community
to
have
the
power
to
issue
bonds
again
with
increase
in
population
there
is
an
increase
in
the
number
of
disputes
over
private
rights
and
temptations
to
crime
become
more
numerous
hence
the
need
of
one
or
more
courts
having
jurisdiction
greater
than
that
possessed
by
justices
of
the
peace
the
conditions
necessitate
also
an
increase
in
the
number
and
the
efficiency
of
the
police
and
to
render
the
police
efficient
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
under
the
direction
of
one
man
the
same
one
who
is
responsible
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
ordinances
of
the
council
namely
the
mayor
a
community
organized
to
comply
with
the
foregoing
requirements
divided
into
wards
having
a
council
made
up
of
aldermen
from
those
wards
having
a
council
authorized
to
levy
taxes
at
its
discretion
having
a
municipal
court
having
regularly
employed
police
acting
under
the
direction
of
the
mayor
is
a
city
as
the
term
is
generally
used
in
the
united
states
another
reason
for
establishing
a
city
government
is
frequently
potent
although
unmentioned
the
pride
of
the
community
can
be
thereby
indulged
and
more
citizens
can
have
their
ambition
to
hold
public
office
gratified
how
a
city
may
be
organized
under

small
ones

usually
work
under

the
custom
is
growing
of
organizing
cities
at
first
under

then
if

outgrows
the

grows
so
that

the
county
need
a
county
organization
is
needed
for
the
following
reasons
establish
the
lower
as
we
have
seen
the
organizations
within
the
county
are
established
by
county
officers
but
it
may
properly
be
asked
why
not
have
them
organized
by
the
state
directly
there
are
at
least
three
good
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
too
burdensome
to
the
state
that
is
the
state
would
act
through
the
legislature
and
to
organize
all
the
individual
school
districts
towns
villages
and
cities
would
take
up
too
much
of
the
time
of
the
legislature
in
the
second
place
the
organizing
could
only
be
done
at
certain
times
namely
during
the
session
of
the
legislature
and
in
the
meantime
communities
would
have
to
wait
in
the
third
place
the
records
of
incorporation
would
be
inaccessible
in
case
they
were
needed
for
reference
serve
as
a
medium
between
the
state
and
the
lower
the
state
uses
the
town
village
and
city
to
value
property
for
purposes
of
taxation
and
as
election
districts
but
it
gets
its
taxes
and
its
election
returns
through
the
county
here
again
may
arise
the
question
why
not
send
the
state
taxes
directly
to
the
capital
and
make
election
returns
directly
also
at
least
two
good
reasons
appear
it
would
increase
the
work
and
therefore
the
number
of
officials
at
the
capital
and
if
a
mistake
should
be
made
it
could
not
be
so
easily
discovered
and
corrected
carry
on
public
works
beyond
the
power
of
the
towns
a
desired
local
improvement
may
be
beyond
the
power
of
a
town
either
because
it
is
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
town
or
because
of
its
expense
thus
a
road
may
be
needed
between
two
centers
of
population
villages
or
cities
which
would
run
through
several
towns
while
the
jurisdiction
of
the
towns
individually
extends
only
to
their
own
borders
or
a
bridge
over
a
wide
stream
may
be
needed
which
would
be
too
expensive
for
the
town
in
which
it
is
located
the
road
and
the
bridge
would
better
be
provided
by
the
county
footnote
sometimes
state
aid
is
secured
do
you
think
it
wise
as
a
rule
for
the
state
to
grant
such
aid
and
the
poor
can
generally
be
better
cared
for
by
the
county
than
by
the
individual
towns
for
the
county
can
erect
and
maintain
a
secure
certain
local
officers
not
needed
in
every
town
for
instance
a
register
of
deeds
the
coroner
the
judge
of
probate
the
superintendent
of
schools
in
most
states
and
the
surveyor
serve
as
a
territorial
basis
for
the
apportionment
of
members
of
the
this
is
perhaps
merely
an
incidental
gain
but
its
convenience
in
defining
legislative
districts
is
obvious
make
justice
cheap
and
it
is
well
in
many
ways
as
we
have
seen
to
have
in
every
town
village
and
city
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction
but
to
in
any
generous
or
satisfying
sense
there
should
be
within
the
reach
of
every
citizen
a
court
competent
to
try
difference
between
individuals
regardless
of
the
amount
in
controversy
and
able
to
punish
any
crime
against
the
laws
of
the
state
to
bring
such
a
court
within
the
reach
of
every
one
was
the
original
reason
for
the
establishment
of
the
county
and
remains
today
the
greatest
advantage
derived
from
its
existence
counties
are
established
by
the
state
legislature
in
thinly
settled
parts
of
a
state
the
counties
are
much
larger
than
in
the
populous
parts
a
county
should
be
large
enough
to
make
its
administration
economical
and
yet
small
enough
to
bring
its
seat
of
justice
within
easy
reach
of
every
one
within
its
boundaries

the
ideal
county

the
administration
of
county
affairs
is
in
the
hands
of
the
county
commissioners

supervisors
this
board
is
usually
constructed
on
one
of
two
plans
either
it
consists
of
three

five

being
divided
into
commissioner
districts
or
else
it
is
constituted

several
town
boards

the

establishing
justice
in
the
county
classes
of
there
are
three
general
classes
of
judicial
business
carried
on
in
the
county
probate
business
civil
actions
and
criminal
prosecutions
probate
courts
the
principal
business
and
characteristic
work
of
probate
courts
is
the
settlement
of
the
estates
of
deceased
persons
jurisdiction
extends
in
most
states
over
both
personal
property
and
real
estate
incidentally
probate
courts
appoint
guardians
for
minors
and
others
subject
to
guardianship
and
control
the
conduct
and
settle
the
accounts
of
such
appointees
in
many
states
jurisdiction
wholly
extraneous
to
the
characteristic
work
of
these
courts
is
imposed
upon
them
or
the
probate
business
is
associated
with
other
jurisdiction
in
the
same
court
thus
in
minnesota
the
judge
of
probate
is
petitioned
in
the
organization
of
cities
as
we
have
seen
in
wisconsin
the
county
court
which
has
charge
of
the
probate
business
has
civil
jurisdiction
also
in
illinois
the
county
court
in
addition
to
the
probate
business
has
jurisdiction
in
proceedings
for
the
collection
of
taxes
and
assessments
and
in
kansas
the
probate
court
has
jurisdiction
in
cases
of
procedure
in
case
a
will
has
been
the
proceedings
of
a
probate
court
have
in
view
two
chief
objects
namely
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
deceased
and
to
distribute
the
remainder
of
his
property
among
those
entitled
to
it
in
case
the
deceased
has
left
a
will
the
proceedings
are
as
follows
for
within
a
short
time
usually
thirty
days
after
the
death
of
the
testator
the
executor
or
other
custodian
of
the
will
presents
it
to
the
probate
court
with
a
petition
that
it
be
admitted
to
probate
for
form
of
petition
see
p
to
persons
acting
on
the
petition
the
probate
judge
publishes
in
a
newspaper
a
notice
to
all
persons
interested
in
the
estate
that
at
a
specified
time
action
will
be
taken
on
the
petition
to
afford
all
who
are
interested
an
opportunity
to
be
present
at
the
hearing
the
notice
must
be
published
for
a
prescribed
time
and
in
some
states
each
of
the
heirs
must
if
possible
be
personally
notified
the
at
the
time
specified
in
the
notice
unless
postponement
be
granted
for
cause
the
proofs
of
the
validity
of
the
will
are
presented
it
must
be
shown
that
the
testator
is
dead
that
the
instrument
was
executed
by
him
voluntarily
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
statute
and
while
he
was
of
sound
mind
and
disposing
memory
usually
it
will
be
sufficient
for
the
two
witnesses
to
the
instrument
to
appear
and
testify
to
the
material
facts
if
any
one
interested
in
the
distribution
of
the
property
thinks
that
this
will
should
not
be
accepted
as
the
last
will
and
testament
of
the
deceased
he
should
now
enter
objections
in
case
of
a
contest
the
proceedings
are
about
the
same
as
those
in
a
justice
or
circuit
court
but
there
is
no
jury
in
the
probate
court
nor
is
there
any
plea
except
the
petition
to
if
the
proofs
are
satisfactory
to
the
court
the
will
is
admitted
to
probate
that
is
it
is
accepted
as
true
and
valid
its
validity
is
established
by
a
decree
of
the
court
and
a
certificate
of
the
fact
is
attached
to
the
will
a
copy
of
the
will
is
made
in
a
book
kept
for
the
purpose
the
original
and
all
the
papers
in
the
case
are
filed
and
preserved
by
the
judge
of
probate
see
pp
and
of
letters
the
genuineness
of
the
will
being
established
it
is
now
in
order
to
carry
out
its
provisions
usually
the
testator
designates
in
his
will
the
person
or
persons
whom
he
wishes
to
act
as
his
representative
in
the
settlement
of
the
estate
such
a
person
is
called
an
executor
if
no
person
is
so
named
the
court
appoints
an
administrator
with
the
will
annexed
in
either
case
the
person
derives
his
authority
from
the
court
unless
excused
in
the
will
the
executor
or
administrator
is
required
to
give
bonds
proportioned
to
the
amount
of
the
personal
property
in
the
estate
the
amount
of
bond
being
specified
by
the
court
the
executor
is
then
furnished
with
a
copy
of
the
will
and
with
letters
testamentary
the
authority
granted
by
the
letters
may
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
form
in
the
appendix
p
to
it
is
a
principle
of
law
that
all
just
debts
shall
be
paid
out
of
one
property
before
any
further
disposition
thereof
can
take
effect
in
order
that
all
persons
having
claims
against
the
estate
of
the
deceased
may
have
an
opportunity
to
present
their
accounts
a
time
for
such
presentation
is
designated
by
the
court
and
due
notice
thereof
is
given
usually
by
publication
in
a
newspaper
of
the
in
the
meantime
the
executor
makes
an
inventory
of
the
property
and
appraisers
appointed
for
the
purpose
put
a
value
thereon
the
several
items
of
the
inventory
being
valued
separately
at
the
time
appointed
in
the
notice
the
court
passes
upon
the
claims
of
creditors
since
unscrupulous
persons
are
at
such
times
tempted
to
present
fraudulent
claims
the
judge
exercises
great
care
in
examining
the
accounts
to
facilitate
matters
it
is
required
that
accounts
be
itemized
and
that
they
be
verified
by
oath
debts
are
paid

the
personal
property

in

the

the
initial
step
in

is
the
appointment

work

under

by

executor
in
order
that

the
appointment

as

sustain

action
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
or
rules
which
govern
the
taking
of
evidence
and
the
weighing
of
testimony
may
properly
appear
here
these
rules
are
designed
to
exclude
all
irrelevant
matter
and
to
secure
the
best
proof
that
can
be
had
must
be
that
is
in
general
they
must
be
able
to
understand
the
nature
and
solemnity
of
an
oath
this
will
usually
exclude
children
below
a
certain
age
insane
persons
and
persons
drunk
at
the
time
of
offering
testimony
must
testify
of
their
own
usually
they
are
barred
from
telling
what
they
simply
believe
to
be
the
fact
or
what
they
have
learned
from
hearsay
must
go
to
prove
the
material
allegations
of
the
it
must
be
confined
to
the
question
at
issue
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
evidence
must
not
only
go
to
prove
the
matter
alleged
but
it
must
be
the
not
the
superfluous
matter
what
is
material
and
what
superfluous
will
depend
upon
the
case
thus
if
it
is
alleged
that
a
suit
of
clothes
was
obtained
by
the
defendant
at
a
certain
time
his
obtaining
the
clothes
is
the
material
fact
and
the
time
may
be
superfluous
or
immaterial
but
if
a
note
is
in
controversy
its
date
is
material
as
establishing
its
identity
the
evidence
must
be
the
best
of
which
the
case
is
susceptible
thus
in
case
of
a
written
instrument
the
best
evidence
is
the
instrument
itself
the
next
best
a
copy
of
it
the
next
oral
statement
of
its
contents
and
a
copy
will
not
be
accepted
if
the
original
can
be
produced
burden
of
proof
lies
on
the
in
civil
cases
the
party
affirming
is
usually
the
plaintiff
in
criminal
cases
it
is
the
state
harmonizing
with
this
principle
is
the
constitutional
provision
that
in
criminal
cases
the
accused
shall
not
be
required
to
give
evidence
against
himself
these
are
the
principal
rules
of
evidence
but
they
have
many
applications

volumes
have
been
written
elaborating
them

the
mode
of
selecting
grand

is
in

the

are
three

the
careful
preparation
of
a

selection
by

third
the
summoning

persons
so
chosen
the
number
of
persons
in
the
first
list
is
from
two
to
three
times
the
number
of

the
preparation
of
the
list
is
in
some
states
entrusted
to
the
county
board
in
others
to
jury
commissioners
in
others
to
the
local
boards
the
names
are
reported
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
who
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
makes
the
selection
by

the
summoning
is
done
by
the
sheriff
on
the
first
day
of
the
term
the
court
appoints
one
of
the
jurors
foreman
the
jury
is
then
sworn
and
after
being
charged
by
the
court
retires
to
a
private
room
and
proceeds
to
the
performance
of
its
duty
the
deliberations
of
the
grand

are
conducted
in
secret
it
may
however
summon
and
examine
witnesses
footnote
witnesses
for
the

are
not
usually
examined
by
the
grand

and
may
have
the
advice
of
the
court
or
of
the
county
attorney
the
fact
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
within
the
county
may
be
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
grand
jury
by
any
member
thereof
or
by
any
other
person
if
upon
examination
there
seems
to
be
reason
for
believing
that
it
was
committed
by
the
person
accused
the
county
attorney
is
called
upon
to
frame
a
formal
accusation
against
him
called
an
which
is
endorsed
with
the
words
a
true
bill
and
sent
to
the
court
upon
the
indictment
the
person
accused
is
arrested
and
tried
if
the
evidence
against
the
accused
is
insufficient
to
warrant
indictment
but
yet
his
innocence
is
questionable
the
grand
jury
may
bring
a
against
him
this
is
an
informal
statement
in
writing
addressed
to
the
court

forth
the
offense

stating
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
a
certain
person
named
has
committed

arrested
on
a

examined
before
a

number
of
grand
jurors
specified
by
statute
under
former
practice

jury
numbered

the
concurrence
of

is
bound
to
investigate
the
charge
against
any

held
by
a
justice
to
await
the
action
of
the
grand

also
any
charge
brought
by

to

to
have
been
committed

is
a
body

according
to

the

as
given

in

the
mode
of
selecting
petit
jurors
is
in
general
the
same
as
that
pursued
in
selecting
grand
jurors
the
list
of
persons
qualified
to
serve
is
however
usually
larger
the
selection
by
lot
is
made
thus
slips
of
paper
each
containing
one
of
the
names
are
folded
and
deposited
in
a
box
the
box
is
shaken
and
the
prescribed
number
of
slips
is
drawn
the
persons
whose
names
thus
appear
are
summoned
as
jurors
when
an
action
is
called
for
trial
by
jury
the
clerk
draws
from
the
jury
box
the
ballots
containing
the
names
of
the
jurors
until
the
jury
is
completed
or
the
ballots
exhausted
if
necessary
the
sheriff
under
direction
of
the
court
summons
bystanders
or
others
in
the
county
to
complete
the
jury
such
persons
are
called
to
secure
an
impartial
jury
each
party
may
object
to
or
challenge
a
number
of
the
jurors
the
challenge
may
be
peremptory
or
for
cause
the
peremptory
challenge
as
its
name
implies
is
one
in
which
no
reason
need
be
assigned
the
number
of
such
challenges
must
of
course
be
limited
in
civil
suits
it
is
usually
limited
to
three
by
each
party
in
criminal
cases
the
state
has
usually
two
peremptory
challenges
and
the
defendant
five
if
the
offense
is
punishable
with
death
or
state
prison
for
life
the
state
has
in
minnesota
seven
peremptory
challenges
and
the
defendant
twenty
challenges
for
cause
may
be
either
general
or
particular
a
general
challenge
of
a
proposed
juror
may
be
made
on
the
basis
of
his
incompetency
or
unworthiness
to
act
in
such
capacity
in
action
a
particular
challenge
may
be
based
on
some
bias
in
this
particular
case
which
would
unfit

originally
to

the
relative
importance
of
the
two
organizations
depends
upon
the
influence
to
which
the
state
was
most
strongly
subjected
the
reason
for
the
difference
is
found
in
the
character
and
circumstances
of
the
early
colonists
in
new
england
the
church
was
the
center
of
the
community
the
severity
of
the
climate
and
the
character
of
the
soil
made
it
impracticable
to
cultivate
large
farms
the
colonists
had
come
mainly
from
the
towns
of
england
these
considerations
and
the
presence
of
fierce
and
unfriendly
indians
caused
the
settlers
to
group
themselves
into
compact
settlements
their
self
assertion
prompted
them
and
their
intelligence
enabled
them
to
take
active
part
in
public
affairs
hence
the
importance
of
the
town
in
new
england
in
the
south
the
colonies
were
planted
largely
in
the
interests
of
the
proprietaries
the
leading
spirits
had
been
county
gentlemen
in
england
and
they
naturally
favored
the
county
system
the
mass
of
the
people
were
unaccustomed
and
indifferent
to
direct
participation
in
the
government
again
the
warm
climate
and
fertile
lands
were
favorable
to
large
plantations
and
a
dispersed
population
so
that
the
character
of
the
people
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
lived
were
alike
favorable
to
the
establishment
of
the
county
system
pure
and
simple
to
quote
the
pithy
statement
of
professor
macy
the
southern
county
was
a
modified
english
shire
with
the
towns
left
out
local
government
in
new
england
was
made
up
of
english
towns
with
the
shire
left
out
subsequently
counties
were
formed
in
new
england
for
judicial
purposes
but
the
towns
retained
the
greater
number
of
their
functions
and
in
the
south
the
counties
were
afterwards
subdivided
into
election
and
police
districts
but
the
administrative
power
remained
with
the
county
the
middle
states
divided
the
local
power
between
the
town
and
the
county
migration
is
chiefly
along
the
parallels
of
latitude
and
people
from
habit
and
instinct
organize
new
governments
largely
on
the
plans
to
which
they
are
accustomed
hence
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
in
the
states
formed
south
of
the
line
of
the
ohio
the
county
is
the
principal
division
while
in
the
northwestern
states
the
town
is
the
important
factor
though
in
the
northwest
the
county
is
more
important
than
in
new
england
the
influence
of
the
towns
in
county
affairs
is
generally
maintained
by
the
selection
of
members
of
the
county
board
from
the
several
towns
illinois
is
a
good
example
of
the
truth
of
the
generalizations
at
the
beginning
of
the
preceding
paragraph
the
state
is
very
long
and
reaches
far
to
the
south
the
southern
part
of
the
state
was
settled
first
and
almost
pure
county
government
prevailed
by
and
by
the
northern
part
began
to
settle
and
it
grew
in
population
faster
than
the
southern
part
the
town
was
introduced
and
now
prevails
in
all

few

can
you
see
the
relation
of
these
facts
to
the
generalization

rise
to

theory
of

is
that
of
of
footnote
there
being
a
constant
tendency
to
centralization
this
thought
should
be
emphasized
see
nordhoff
politics
for
young
americans
that
is
we
think
it
best
to
keep
power
as
near
as
possible
to
the
people
if
a
certain
work
can
be
accomplished
fairly
by
individual
enterprise
we
prefer
that
it
be
done
so
rather
than
through
any
governmental
agency
if
work
can
be
done
by
the
town
just
as
well
as
by
the
county
we
assign
it
to
the
town
and
as
between
the
state
and
the
general
government
we
assign
no
duty
to
the
latter
which
can
be
performed
as
well
by
the
former
there
are
many
practical
reasons
among
them
may
be
mentioned
the
following
we
need
the

their
a
constitution
in
the
american
sense
of
the
term
is
a
written
instrument
defining
the
powers
of
government
and
distributing
those
powers
among
the
branches
or
departments
thereof
it
is
the
fundamental
law
the
voice
of
the
people
granting
or
withholding
power
a
primary
purpose
of
the
instrument
is
to
give
form
and
authority
to
the
government
another
is
to
protect
individuals
and
minorities
from
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
each
of
the
states
has
a
constitution
their
in
most
of
the
countries
of
europe
including
england
what
is
called
the
constitution
is
not
written
it
consists
largely
of
the
maxims
of
experience
the
principles
sanctioned
by
custom
when
a
new
political
custom
becomes
prevalent
it
gradually
becomes
recognized
as
part
of
the
constitution
written
constitutions
in
this
country
probably
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
charters
granted
to
the
colonies
and
securing
to
them
privileges
were
in
writing
and
these
written
charters
themselves
grew
out
of
a
practice
prevalent
in
england
of
securing
the
rights
of
towns
and
cities
by
written
charters
wrung
from
the
king
some
general
charters
of
liberties
too
had
been
secured
among
these
may
be
mentioned
the
charter
granted
by
henry
in
the
magna
charta
or
great
charter
wrung
from
king
john
in
and
the
petition
of
right
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
bill
of
rights
secured
in
the
seventeenth
century
some
of
the
charters
granted
to
colonies
were
so
liberal
in
their
terms
that
they
were
adopted
as
constitutions
when
the
colonies
became
states
the
charter
of
connecticut
remained
its
constitution
till
and
even
in
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
people
of
rhode
island
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
up
the
old
charter
for
a
new
constitution
their
the
state
constitutions
are
very
much
alike
in
their
general
characteristics
after
a
preamble
setting
forth
the
purpose
of
the
instrument
they
usually
contain
a
bill
of
rights
intended
to
secure
personal
liberty
and
other
personal
rights
they
then
distribute
the
powers
of
government
among
three
branches
or
departments
and
provide
for
the
organization
and
general
procedure
of
each
then
follow
miscellaneous
provisions
relating
to
franchise
education
amendments
etc
their
usual
we
have
flourished
so
wonderfully
under
our
system
of
government
that
we
naturally
have
a
great
reverence
for
our
national
and
state
constitutions
so
far
has
this
feeling
gone
that
a
large
number
of
people
seem
to
fancy
that
there
is
some
magic
in
the
very
word
constitution
as
a
consequence
state
constitutions
are
usually
too
long
they
contain
too
many
miscellaneous
provisions
most
of
these
relate
to
transient
or
petty
matters
which
if
made
affairs
for
public
action
at
all
should
be
left
to
legislation
changes
in
the
constitution
weaken
our
respect
for
it
rarely
should
anything
go
into
that
great
charter
which
has
not
stood
the
test
of
time
unless
it
has
the
promise
of
endurance
as
a
necessary
safeguard
of
the
rights

of

usually
assert

almost
matters

any

ever
seriously
questioned

the

of
the
claims
there
set
forth

in
enumerating
them
we
are
treading
on

our

hundreds
of
years

power

they
gave
freely

of

against

functions

powers
with
regard
to
law
in
our
government
and
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
all
free
countries
these
powers
are
vested
in
three
sets
of
persons
if
one
person
or
group
of
persons
could
make
the
laws
interpret
them
and
enforce
obedience
to
them
as
interpreted
the
power
of
such
person
or
persons
would
be
unlimited
and
unlimited
power
begets
tyranny
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
constitution
is
to
limit
the
power
of
the
government
within
its
proper
sphere
and
to
prevent
misuse
of
authority
and
this
organization
of
the
government
in
three
departments
each
acting
independently
so
far
as
may
be
and
acting
as
a
check
upon
the
others
is
one
of
the
modes
of
limitation
the
the
and
the
branches
are
called
respectively
the
legislative
the
judicial
and
the
executive
branches
chapter
xii
the
legislative
branch
the
legislature
of
every
state
consists
of
two
chambers
or
houses
the
for
this
is
that
during
colonial
times
most
of
the
legislatures
consisted
of
two
houses
the
governor
council
and
the
representative
assembly
then
on
becoming
states
each
of
the
old
thirteen
except
pennsylvania
organized
bicameral
legislatures
and
the
new
states
being
largely
settled
by
people
from
the
older
states
naturally
followed
their
example
the
structure
of
congress
has
also
had
much
influence
the
to
be
derived
from
having
two
houses
are
numerous
perhaps
the
only
one
which
it
is
necessary
to
mention
here
is
that
it
tends
to
prevent
hasty
legislation
because
under
this
arrangement
a
bill
must
be
considered
at
least
twice
before
passage
as
the
population
of
a
state
is
changeful
the
constitution
does
not
usually
specify
the
number
of
members
to
compose
each
house
this
is
determined
within
certain
limitations
imposed
in
the
constitution
by
the
legislature
itself
a
is
usually
made
every
five
years
after
a
census
by
the
state
or
general
government

number
of
senators
usually
ranges
between
thirty
and
fifty
that
of
representatives
from
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
the
legislature
meets
biennially
in
most
of
the
states
people
are
beginning
to
understand
that
they
may
suffer
from
an
excess
of
legislation
some
of
the
english
kings
used
to
try
to
run
the
government
without
parliament
and
frequent
sessions
of
parliament
were
then
demanded
as
a
protection
to
popular
rights
hence
our
forefathers
instinctively
favored
frequent
sessions
of
the
legislature
but
such
necessity
no
longer
exists
and
for
many
reasons
the
states
have
with
a
few
exceptions
changed
from
annual
to
biennial
sessions
footnote
extra
sessions
may
be
called
by
the
governor
mississippi
has
its
regular
sessions
for
general
legislation
once
in
four
years
and
special
sessions
midway
between
senators
and
representatives
are
both
elected
by
the
people
in
some
cases
the
states
are
divided
into
senatorial
and
representative
districts
in
such
a
way
that
each
elects
one
senator
and
one
representative
the
senate
districts
being
of
course
the
larger
in
other
cases
the
state
is
divided
into
senate
districts
only
and
each
senate
district
chooses
one
senator
and
an
assigned
number
of
representatives
the
former
plan
prevails
in
wisconsin
for
instance
and
the
latter
in
minnesota
the
number
of
representatives
chosen
in
a
senatorial
district
varies
from
one
to
half
a
dozen
dependent
upon
population
illinois
has
a
peculiar
and
it
would
seem
an
excellent
plan
the
state
is
divided
on
the
basis
of
population
into
parts
as
nearly
equal
as
possible
each
of
these
districts
elects
one
senator
and
three
representatives
in
voting
for
representatives
a
person
may
mass
his
three
votes
on
one
candidate
or
give
them
to
two
or
three
the
purpose
is
to
enable
a
party
in
the
minority
to
secure
some
representation
the
length
of
term
of
legislators
usually
depends
upon
the
frequency
of
sessions
the
general
principle
seems
to
be
that
representatives
shall
serve
through
one
session
and
senators
through
two
how
long
then
would
you
expect
the
respective
terms
to
be
in
states

annual
sessions

makes

usually
called

you

unruly

they
may
be

footnote

among

but
in
extreme
cases
they
may
be
expelled
to
prevent
a
partizan
majority
from
trumping
up
charges
and
expelling
members
of
the
opposite
party
it
is
a
common
constitutional
provision
that
the
concurrence
of
of
all
the
members
elected
shall
be
necessary
for
expulsion
house
chooses
its
own
each
house
has
a
presiding
officer
several
secretaries
or
clerks
a
a
postmaster
and
a
chaplain
the
usually
has
a
number
of
assistants
appointed
by
himself
and
there
are
a
number
of
pages
appointed
by
the
presiding
officer
these
however
hardly
count
as
officers
the
only
exception
to
the
rule
enunciated
is
in
those
states
having
a
lieutenant
governor
who
is
president
of
the
senate
even
in
that
case
the
senate
elects
in
case
of
a
vacancy
the
person
so
elected
being
chosen
from
among
their
own
number
and
receiving
usually
the
title
of
president
it
would
hardly
be
possible
for
all
members
to
be
present
every
day
therefore
a
number
less
than
the
whole
should
have
authority
to
act
but
this
number
should
not
be
very
small
the
several
constitutions
fix
the
quorum
for
each
house
usually
at
a
majority
of
the
members
elected
to
it
but
a
smaller
number
has
power
of
adjournment
from
day
to
day
so
that
the
organization
may
not
be
lost
and
it
may
compel
the
attendance
of
absent
members
by
sending
the
after
them
on
the
theory
that
legislators
are
servants
of
the
people
we
would
naturally
expect
the
proceedings
to
be
made
public
and
so
they
are
publicity
is
secured
in
the
following
ways
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
provision
each
house
keeps
a
journal
of
its
proceedings
which
it
publishes
from
time
to
time
usually
every
day
spectators
are
admitted
to
witness
the
daily
sessions
newspaper
reporters
are
admitted
and
are
furnished
facilities
for
making
full
and
accurate
reports
privileges
of
in
order
that
their
constituents
may
not
for
frivolous
or
sinister
reasons
be
deprived
of
their
services
in
the
legislature
the
members
of
each
house
are
from
during
the
session
of
their
respective
houses
and
in
going
to
and
returning
from
the
same
nor
can
civil
suit
be
brought
against
them
during
that
time
but
they
may
be
arrested
for
treason
defined
in
the
constitution
felony
or
breach
of
the
peace
because
if
guilty
they
are
unworthy
of
a
seat
in
the
legislature
and
in
order
that
there
may
be
the
utmost
of
in
the
legislature
that
any
member
who
knows
of
wrong
being
done
may
feel
perfectly
free
to
say
so
the
constitution
of
each
state
provides
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house
they
shall
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place
members
of
the
legislature
receive
for
their
services
a
salary
which
is
sometimes
specified
in
the
constitution
but
which
is
usually
fixed
by
law
in
the
latter
case
no
increase
voted
can
be
in
effect
until
a
new
legislative
term
begins
this
proviso
is
of
course
designed
to
remove
the
temptation
to
increase
the
salary
for
selfish
ends
in
some
countries
no
salary
is
paid
to
legislators
the
theory
being
that
with
the
temptation
of
salary
removed
only
persons
of
public
spirit
will
accept
election
our
argument
is
that
unless
some
remuneration
be
given
many
persons
of
public
spirit
and
possessed
of
capacity
for
public
service
would
be
barred
from
accepting
seats
in
the
legislature
in
other
words
the
state
wants
the
services
of
her
best
citizens
and
does
not
wish
lack
of
wealth
on
the
part
of
any
competent
person
to
stand
in
the
way
on
the
other
hand
that
there
may
be
no
temptation
to
continue
the
sessions
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
the
pay
the
constitution
provides
where
a
salary
is
paid
that
members
shall
not
receive
more
than
a
certain
sum
for
any
regular
session
or
a
certain
other
sum
for
any
extra
session
prohibitions
on
to
secure

no

the
united
states
or
the
state
in
some
states
as
in
minnesota
the
office
of
postmaster
is
excepted
and
in
order
that
legislators
may
be
freed
from
the
temptation
to
create
offices
for
themselves
or
to
increase
the
emoluments
of
any
office
for
their
own
benefit
it
provides
that
no
senator
or

shall
hold
any
office
under
the
state
which
has
been
created
or
the
emoluments
of
which
have
been
increased
during
the
session
of
the

of
which
he
was
a
member

one
year
after
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
in
the

to
be
eligible
to

resided
for
some
time
usually
six
months
or
a
year
immediately
preceding
election
in
the
district
from
which
he
is
chosen
this
last
provision
is
made
to
preclude
people
who
have
not
been
living
in
the
district
and
who
therefore
can
not
know
it
or
be
interested
particularly
in
its
welfare
from
representing
it

being

a
short
term
it
is
more
directly
under
the
control
of

in
the
order

succession
in

in
any

most
usual
plan
is

the
governor
to
make
a
temporary
appointment
until
a

can
be
held
for
an

good
until

the

the
great
the
characteristic
duty
of
the
governor
is
to
see
that
the

are
faithfully
executed
since
this
may
sometimes
require

he
is
made

and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of

senate
most
of
the
important
state
officers
and
boards
as
provided
by
law
the
advice
of
the
senate
is
rarely
if
ever
asked
but
its
consent
must
be
obtained
to
make
any
such
appointment
valid
as
his
duties
continue
through
the
year
and
have
to
do
with
the
whole
state
and
as
he
may
require
the
opinion
in
writing
of
the
principal
officer
in
each
of
the
executive
departments
upon
any
subject
pertaining
to
the
duties
of
their
respective
offices
he
is
supposed
to
know
more
than
any
other
person
about
the
situation
and
needs
of
the
state
as
a
whole
and
it
is
therefore
made
his
duty
to
communicate
by
message
to
each
session
of
the
legislature
such
information
touching
the
affairs
of
the
state
as
he
deems
expedient
the
regular
message
is
sent
at
the
opening
of
the
legislative
session
and
special
messages
at
any
time
during
the
session
as
they
seem
to
be
needed
on
extraordinary
occasions
he
may
convene
the
legislature
in
extra
session
to
place
another
obstruction
in
the
way
of
hasty
legislation

historical
in
order
to
understand
the
government
of
the
united

we
must
examine
its
beginnings
and
antecedents
the
colonies
when
columbus
returned
to
spain
with
his
marvelous
stories
of
the
new
world
expeditions
were
fitted
out
which
soon
filled
the
coffers
of
that
country
with
wealth
from
mexico
central
and
south
america
and
the
west
indies
spain
became
the
wealthiest
nation
of
the
world
other
countries
soon
caught
the
infection
and
expeditions
were
sent
from
france
holland
and
england
the
other
great
commercial
nations
of
western
europe
for
a
long
time
scarcely
any
effort
was
made
to
form
permanent
settlements
and
the
attempts
that
were
by
and
by
made
were
unsuccessful
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
the
territory
now
included
within
the
united
states
remained
unoccupied
except
at
a
few
points
in
the
southern
part
explorations
were
however
pushed
with
vigor
and
many
conflicting
claims
were
based
upon
them
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
permanent
settlements
began
to
be
made
yet
the
increase
in
population
was
for
the
succeeding
hundred
and
fifty
years
very
slow
during
this
time
settlements
were
made
in
the
tropical
part
of
america
by
the
spanish
the
french
founded
settlements
in
canada
and
established
a
chain
of
forts
along
the
ohio
and
mississippi
and
the
english
though
claiming
all
the
land
to
the
pacific
made
settlements
only
along
the
atlantic
the
dutch
and
the
swedes
made
settlements
along
the
hudson
and
about
delaware
bay
respectively
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
swedes
had
been
dispossessed
by
the
dutch
who
in
turn
had
succumbed
to
the
english
and
in
began
the
great
struggle
between
france
and
england
for
the
possession
of
the
mississippi
valley
england
won
and
the
existence
of
the
united
states
as
we
know
and
love
it
became
a
possibility
the
causes
of
the
revolution
the
causes
of
the
revolutionary
war
fall
naturally
into
two
great
classes
the
remote
and
the
immediate
the
remote
among
the
underlying
causes
of
the
war
may
be
mentioned
the
following
location
of
the
they
were
separated
from
the
mother
country
by
a
great
ocean
which
then
seemed
many
times
as
wide
as
it
does
now
communication
was
so
infrequent
that
the
authorities
in
england
could
not
keep
track
of
what
was
going
on
in
america
and
misgovernment
could
flourish
unchecked
because
unknown
and
so
far
away
and
so
differently
circumstanced
from
the
people
in
england
were
the
people
of
the
colonies
that
the
former
could
not
appreciate
the
real
needs
of
the
latter
character
of
the
character
is
the
product
largely
of
ancestry
and
circumstances
the
ancestors
of
these
people
after
a
struggle
lasting
hundreds
of
years
had
established
liberty
in
england
and
intrenched
it
in
guarantees
the
wisest
ever
devised
by
man
from
them
the
colonists
inherited
the
right
of
freedom
from
arbitrary
arrest

giving
bail
in
ordinary

a
speedy
public
trial

the
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed

writ
of
habeas
corpus

and
indeed
of
nearly
all
the
rights
mentioned
in
the
first
ten
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
their
ancestors
had
in
the
war
between
cromwell
and
charles
laid
down
their
lives
to
establish
the
principle
that
taxes
can
be
laid
only
by
the
people
or
by
their
representatives
the
colonists
themselves
had
been
compelled
to
face
difficulties
incident
to
life
in
a
new
country
and
had
developed
the
power
to
act
independently
in
matters
pertaining
to
their
individual
good
and
in
the
management
of
their
several
commonwealths
they
had
gained
considerable
experience
in

affairs

among
the
immediate
causes

may
be
mentioned
french
and
indian
in
the
first
place
this

facilitated
the
union
of
the
colonies
several
attempts
at
union
had
failed
there
were
too
many
opposing
influences
while
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
colonists
were
english
there
were
many
dutch
in
new
york
and
some
swedes
remained
in
delaware
moreover
the
english
themselves
differed
radically
in
politics
those
in
the
south
having
been
royalists
while
those
in
new
england
sympathized
with
cromwell
and
parliament
but
more
serious
than
these
political
differences
were
the
differences
in
religion
the
old
european
quarrels
had
an
echo
here
and
the
catholics
of
maryland
the
episcopalians
of
virginia
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
the
baptists
of
rhode
island
the
lutherans
of

all
had
grievances
to
remember
travel
which
does
so
much
to
broaden
the
mind
and
free
it
from
prejudice
was
both
difficult
and
dangerous
the
french
and
indian
war
bringing
together
men
from
all
the
colonies
was
of
great
service
in
breaking
down
intercolonial
animosities
facing
the
same
dangers
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
battle
and
mingling
with
each
other
around
the
camp
fires
the
men
of
the
several
colonies
came
to
know
each
other
better
and
this
knowledge
ripened
into
affection
the
soldiers
on
their
return
home
did
much
to
disseminate
the
good
feeling
in
the
second
place
the
french

indian
war
by
annihilating
all
the
claims
of
france
to
american
soil
removed
the
principal
enemy
that
had
rendered
the
protection
of
england
necessary
to
the
colonies
in
the
third
place
this
war
gave
the
colonists
an
experience
in
military
affairs
and
a
confidence
in
their
own
powers
which
emboldened
them
to
dare
open
rebellion
and
in
the
fourth
place
this
war
produced
the
debt
which
led
to
the

on

affairs
by

congress
clothed
with
undefined
powers
for
the
general
good
this
congress
had
speaking
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
good
people
of
these
colonies
issued
the
declaration
of
independence
it
had
entered
into
an
alliance
with
france
and
it
had
prosecuted
the
war
almost
to
a
successful
issue
before
it
had
received
any
definite
warrant
for
its
acts
its
acts
were
justified
by
necessity
and
had
their
authority
in
the
common
consent
of
a
majority
of
the
people
during
nearly
all
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
people
of
the
colonies
were
largely
held
together
by
their
fears
the
articles
themselves
their
but
these
were
a
people
of
peace
and
good
order
this
is
shown
in
part
by
the
spirit
and
form
of
the
declaration
of
independence
they
had
no
idea
of
allowing
themselves
to
lapse
or
drift
into
anarchy
they
understood
the
necessity
for
a
permanent
government
accordingly
when
on
the
eleventh
of
june
a
committee
of
congress
was
appointed
to
abolish
one
form
of
government
by
drafting
a
declaration
of
independence
another
committee
was
appointed
to
frame
a
plan
on
which
to
institute
a
new
government
after
more
than
a
month
deliberation
this
committee
reported
its
plan
embodied
in
what
is
called
articles
of
confederation
this
plan
was
discussed
from
time
to
time
and
finally
somewhat
modified
was
agreed
to
by
congress
november
it
was
then
submitted
to
the
states
for
ratification
in
july
the
articles
were
ratified
by
ten

the
states

in
november
and

the
articles
were
not
to

except

as
congress
should
deem
necessary
reasons
for
the
suffering
breeds
caution
every
one
of
the
peculiarities
was
based
upon
distrust
the
people
were
afraid
to
trust
their
delegates
this
is
manifest
in
the
shortness
of
the
term
the
provision
for
recall
the
reserved
right
to
control
the
delegates
by
controlling
their
pay
and
the
limitation
as
to
service
the
states
were
afraid
of
each
other
especially
were
the
small
states
distrustful
of
the
large
ones
this
is
evidenced
in
the
provision
that
each
state
should
have
one
vote
by
this
arrangement
the
states
had
equal
power
in
the
congress
the
people
and
the
states
were
afraid
of
the
general
government
a
central
government
was
a
necessity
but
it
was
given
only
very
limited
powers
the
people
would
not
have
an
executive
officer
because
they
feared
anything
resembling
kingly
rule
they
did
not
dare
to
establish
a
national
judiciary
having
jurisdiction
over
persons
and
property
because
their
experience
with
trials
beyond
the
sea
had
made
them
wary
of
outside
tribunals
it
is
to
be
observed
however
that
with
all
their
distrust
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
their
colonial
or
state
jealousies
and
habits
had
returned
upon
them
notwithstanding
their
specific
statement
in
the
instrument
itself
that
each
state
retains
its
sovereignty
the
instinct
of
nationality
was
yet
strong
enough
to
cause
them
to
continue
in
the
general
government
the
actual
sovereign
powers
thus
the
united
states
alone
could
treat
with
foreign
nations
declare
war
and
make
peace
another
great
sovereign
power
that
of
coining
money
was
unfortunately
shared
by
the
states
their
the
great
defect
in
the
articles
of
confederation
was
that
they
placed
too
little
power
in
the
hands
of
the
general
government
although
congress
possessed
the
right
to
declare
war
it
could
only
apportion
the
quota
of
men
to
each
state
the
states
raised
the
troops
and
so
on
with
the
other
powers
the
government
of
the
united
states
during
the
confederation
period
was
a
name
without
a
body
a
shadow
without
a
substance
an
eminent
statesman
of
the
time
remarked
that
by
this
political
compact
the
continental
congress
have
exclusive
power
for
the
following
purposes
without
being
able
to
execute
one
of
them
they
may
make
and
conclude
treaties
but
they
can
only
recommend
the
observance
of
them
they
may
appoint
ambassadors
but
they
can
not
defray
even
the
expenses
of
their
tables
they
may
borrow
money
on
the
faith
of
the
union
but
they
can
not
pay
a
dollar
they
may
coin
money
but
they
can
not
buy
an
ounce
of
bullion
they
may
make
war
and
determine
what
troops
are
necessary
but
they
can
not
raise
a
single
soldier
in
short
they
may
declare
everything
but
they
can
do
nothing
the
the
history
of
the
confederation
during
the
twelve
years
beyond
which
it
was
not
able
to
maintain
itself
is
the
history
of
the
utter
prostration
throughout
the
whole
country
of
every
public
and
private
interest
of
that
which
was
beyond
all
comparison
the
most
trying
period
of
our
national
and
social
life
for
it
was
the
extreme
weakness
of
the
confederate
government
if
such
it
could
be
called
which
caused
the
war
of
independence
to
drag
its
slow
length
along
through
seven
dreary
years
and
which
but
for
a
providential
concurrence
of
circumstances
in
europe
must
have
prevented
it
from
reaching
any
other
than
a
disastrous
conclusion
when
at
last
peace
was
proclaimed
the
confederate
congress
had
dwindled
down
to
a
feeble
junto
of
about
twenty
persons
and
was
so
degraded
and
demoralized
that
its
decisions
were
hardly
more
respected
than
those
of
any
voluntary
and
irresponsible
association
the
treaties
which
the
confederation
had
made
with
foreign
powers
it
was
forced
to
see
violated
and
treated
with
contempt
by
its
own
members
which
brought
upon
it
distrust
from
its
friends
and
scorn
from
its
enemies
it
had
no
standing
among
the
nations
of
the
world
because
it
had
no
power
to
secure
the
faith
of
its
national
obligations
for
want
of
an
uniform
system
of
duties
and
imposts

discovered

it
was
objected
by
some

that
they
had
no

no
authority

they
certainly
had
no

no

was
the

the
constitution
of
the
united

the
enacting
clause
or
preamble
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
the
preamble
or
enacting
clause
is
very
important
because
it
states
the
purposes
for
which
the
constitution
was
framed
and
is
therefore
a
valuable
aid
in
interpreting
its
provisions
these
words
are
important
because
first
they
recognize
the
people
as
the
source
of
power
second
they
show
that
the
constitution
is
different
in
nature
from
the
articles
of
confederation
the
latter
was
a
compact
between
states
adopted
by
state
legislatures
acting
for
the
states
as
such
the
former
was
ordained
and
established
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
people
acting
as
a
unit
and
the
expression
which
was
inserted
in
the
preamble
after
due
deliberation
is
therefore
an
argument
in
favor
of
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
and
not
a
mere
confederacy
more
perfect
than
under
the
articles
of
confederation
in
which
the
states
were
declared
sovereign
and
independent
the
sovereignty
is
given
by
the
constitution
to
the
general
government
which
is
clothed
with
ample
power
to
maintain
its
independence
at
the
same
time
such
limitations
are
placed
upon
its
power
as
will
prevent
its
becoming
despotic
to
establish
justice
is
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
government
under
the
articles
of
confederation
there
had
been
no
national
judiciary
and
state
courts
often
discriminated
against
foreigners
and
citizens
of
other
states
to
remedy
this
to
establish
justice
throughout
the
land
the
national
judiciary
was
created
by
the
constitution
domestic
tranquillity
means
here
peace
among
the
states
and
within
each
state
the
condition
of
affairs
during
the
confederation
period
had
been
woeful
a
long
war
had
impoverished
the
people
and
unable
to
pay
their
taxes
they
had
in
several
places
broken
out
in
rebellion
each
state
by
commercial
regulations
was
trying
to
better
its
fortunes
even
at
the
expense
of
the
others
these
regulations
and
disputes
about
boundaries
kept
the
states
quarreling
among
themselves
by
transferring
to
the
general
government
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
states
by
giving
it
power
to
enforce
treaties
and
by
creating
a
tribunal
with
authority
to
settle
controversies
between
states
the
framers
of
the
constitution
removed
in
a
large
measure
the
irritating
causes
of
discord
but
to
peace
the
general
government
was
expressly
given
power
to
put
down
insurrections
in
the
states
to
defend
the
country
is
another
of
the
important
duties
of
government
the
united
states
could
do
this
better
than
each
state
could
defend
itself
several
reasons
are
obvious
therefore
the
general
government
was
empowered
to
raise
and
maintain
an
army
and
navy
and
it
thus
became
competent
to
inspire
confidence
at
home
and
respect
abroad
to
promote
the
general
welfare
was
the
great
object
for
which
the
government
was
organized
and
all
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
have
that
in
view
this
expression
was
intended
to
cover
all
those
things
which
a
government
may
properly
do
for
the
good
of
the
people
it
is
very
elastic
as
it
was
intended
to
be
and
has
covered
acts
as
different
as
the
purchase
of
louisiana
and
the
endowment
of
agricultural
colleges
the
granting
of
a
patent
and
the
establishment
of
this
is
a
worthy
climax
to
the
preamble
the
great
struggle
which
began
in
the
mother
country
continued
through
colonial
times
and
culminated
in
the
revolution
had
been
for
liberty
the
love
of
liberty
had
illumined
the
pathway
of
the
pilgrims
crossing
unknown
seas
it
had
glowed
in
the
declaration
of
independence
it
had
warmed
the
hearts
of
the
soldiers
at
valley
forge
liberty
had
now
been
won
the
problem
was
how
to
render
it
secure
the
desired
security
was
to
be
found
only
in
the
formation
of
a
government
having
all
powers
necessary
for
national
sovereignty
and
independence
while
retaining
in
the
states
all
powers
necessary
for
local
chapter

article
the
legislative
branch
section
congress
legislative
powers
herein
granted
shall
be
vested
in
a
congress
of
the
united
states
which
shall
consist
of
a
senate
and
house
of
the
division
of
governmental
functions
among
three
branches
has
already
been
discussed
on
page
the
legislative
branch
comes
first
and
occupies
most
space
in
the
constitution
because
its
framers
regarded
the
legislative
as
the
most
important
branch
and
laws
must
be
before
they
can
be
interpreted
or
executed
the
for
the
creation
of
two
houses
or
chambers
was
that
thus
only
could
the
conflicting
claims
of
the
large
and
small
states
be
reconciled
it
was
in
fact
a
the
first
of
a
series
only
a
few
in
the
convention
thought
at
first
of
having
two
houses
the
plan
being
to
continue
as
under
the
articles
of
confederation
with
one
house
on
the
question
of
apportioning
representatives
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
decided
difference
of
opinion
the
small
states
wished
to
continue
the
principle
of
the
articles
of
confederation
which
gave
the
several
states
equal
power
but
the
large
states
insisted
that
the
power
of
a
state
should
be
proportion
to
its
the
differences
were
finally
settled
by
the
creation
of
two
houses
in
one
of
which
the
states
should
have
equal
power
and
in
the
other
the
representation
should
be
based
upon
population
connecticut
has
the
honor
of
furnishing
this
valuable
compromise
in
her
legislature
representation
in
one
house
was
based
on
population
in
the
other
the
towns
had
equal
representation
among
the
of
having
two
houses
aside
from
that
mentioned
on
page
are
these
it
tends
to
prevent
a
few
popular
leaders
from
carrying
through
laws
not
designed
for
the
common
good
it
secures
a
review
of
any
proposed
measure
by
men
elected
in
different
ways
and
looking
at
it
from
different
standpoints
as
our
congress
is
organized
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
being
elected
by
popular
vote
and
for
a
short
term
are
likely
to
represent
with
considerable
faithfulness
the
wishes
of
the
people
but
the
people
may
be
for
a
time
wrong
as
for
instance
in
the
persecution
of
the
witches
and
senators
who
by
their
mode
of
election
and
length
of
term
are
made
somewhat
independent
can
comparatively
without
fear
do
what
seems
right
even
if
temporarily
unsupported
by
public
opinion
section
house

composition
and
house
of
representatives
shall
be
composed
of
members
chosen
every
second
year
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
and
the
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
so
called
because
it
represents
the
people
the
term
under
the
confederation
had
been
one
year
this
was
too
short
to
permit
any
adequate
study
of
the
subjects
to
be
legislated
upon
this
longer
term
two
years
is
still
short
enough
to
impose
upon
representatives
the
feeling
of
responsibility
the
term
begins
march
at
noon
the
time
covered
by
a
term
is
called
congress
thus
we
speak
of
the
fortieth
congress
meaning
the
fortieth
two
years
of
our
constitutional
existence
the
name
also
applies
to
the
body
constituting
our
national
legislative
department
during
that
time
thus
we
say
that
a
certain
person
is
a
member
of
congress
a
congress
includes
two
regular
sessions
and
any
number
of
extra
sessions
which
the
president
may
see
fit
to
call
or
which
may
be
provided
for
by
law
the
first
regular
session
is
called
the
long
session
because
congress
may
remain
in
session
through
the
summer
if
it
choose
the
second
is
called
the
short
session
because
it
must
end
march
at
noon
expiring
thus
by
limitation
it
lasts
not
more
than
about
three
months
the
word
here
means
each
state
is
divided
by
its
legislature
into
congressional
districts
equal
in
number
to
the
representatives
to
which
it
is
entitled
and
the
people
of
each
district
elect
one
representative
sometimes
when
a
state
has
its
representation
increased
after
a
new
census
the
old
congressional
districts
are
left
for
a
time
undisturbed
and
the
added
representatives
are
elected
at
large
while
the
others
are
chosen
by
districts
as
before
voters
the
qualifications
for
voting
in
any
state
are
fixed
by
the
state
itself
and
different
states
require
different
qualifications
when
the
constitution
was
framed
but
not
now
some
states
required
higher
qualifications
in
voters
for
the
upper
house
of
the
state
legislature
than
in
voters
for
the
lower
so
that
more
persons
could
vote
for
members
of
the
lower
which
is
always
the
most
numerous
branch
than
for
the
higher
desiring
to
make
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
as
popular
as
possible
the
framers
of
the
constitution
determined
that
all
whom
any
state
was
willing
to
trust
to
vote
for
a
member
of
the
lower
house
of
the
state
legislature
the
united
states
could
trust
to
vote

direct

have

laid
only
in
the
revolutionary
war
had
just
been
fought
to
maintain
the
principle
taxation
and
representation
go
hand
in
hand
and
this
provision
was
made
in
harmony
therewith
the
including
of
direct
taxes
was
a
concession
to
the
slaveholding
states
men
women
and
children
apprentices
slaves
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
like
to
use
the
word
slave
and
therefore
used
this
expression
most
of
them
even
the
slaveholders
hoped
that
slavery
would
soon
cease
to
be
in
determining
the
persons
to
be
enumerated
much
difficulty
was
encountered
the
slaveholding
states
wished
the
slaves
counted
as
individuals
claiming
that
they
had
as
much
right
to
be
represented
as
had
women
children
and
other
the
footnote
in
all
the
states
except
massachusetts
slavery
then
existed
but
in
the
northern
states
the
number
of
slaves
was
so
small
that
we
may
call
them
states
thought
that
being
held
as
property
they
should
not
be
counted
at
all
for
purposes
of
representation
this
provision
in
the
constitution
was
the
outcome
another
compromise
called
the
the
prime
purpose
in
taking
the
census
is
to
find
out
the
number
of
people
in
each
state
so
that
representation
may
be
equalized
but
the
census
takers
collect
at
the
same
time
a
vast
amount
of
other
useful
information
upon
the
agriculture
manufactures
commerce
of
the
country
reports
of
the
census
are
published
by
the
government
for
gratuitous
distribution
the
first
meeting
of
congress
was
held
in
and
the
first
census
was
taken
in
to
prevent
the
house
from
becoming
too
large
but
the
population
of
the
united
states
has
constantly
and
rapidly
increased
so
that
the
ratio
of
representation
as
it
is
called
has
been
made
greater
at
each
census
it
now
takes
people
to
secure
a
representative
for
ratio
in
each
decade
see
pages
so
that
even
the
smallest
states
shall
be
represented
vacancies
happen
in
the
representation
from
any
state
the
executive
authority
thereof
shall
issue
writs
of
election
to
fill
such
vacancies
vacancies
usually
happen
through
the
death
or
resignation
of
the
incumbent
but
a
vacancy
may
be
made
by
the
expulsion
of
a
member

by

far
he
has
always
appointed
the

as
the
work
of

largely
shaped
by

it
may
be
fairly
asked
whether
any
one
else
can
so
affect
the
legislation
of
the
country
as
can
the

whether
indeed
he
has
not
too
much
power

have
you
read

to

in
which
a
certain
member
of
the
house

had
been
alluded
to
contemptuously
as
a
young
man
could
one
who
is
not
a
voter
be
elected
to
the
house
is
a
woman
eligible
could
the
state
impose
other
qualifications
than
those
mentioned
in
the
constitution
section
the
senate
senate
of
the
united
states
shall
be
composed
of
two
senators
from
each
state
chosen
by
the
legislature
thereof
for
six
years
and
each
senator
shall
have
one
vote
latin
from
an
old
man
this
dignified
term
seems
a
favorite
being
used
in
many
countries
to
designate
the
upper
house
in
other
countries
a
term
is
used
having
the
same
signification
this
arrangement
will
be
remembered
as
the
concession
made
by
the
large
states
to
the
small
ones
had
the
number
of
senators
been
fixed
at
one
from
each
state
equality
of
power
among
the
states
would
still
have
been
secured
but
sickness
or
accident
might
then
leave
a
state
unrepresented
by
having
two
this
difficulty
is
obviated
the
two
can
consult
about
the
needs
of
their
state
and
the
senate
is
large
enough
to
confer
power
and
encourage
firmness
three
from
each
state
would
bring
no
advantages
which
are
not
now
secured
while
the
senate
would
be
unnecessarily
large
and
expensive
this
mode
of
election
was
fixed
upon
for
two
reasons
first
the
senators
represent
the
state
as
such
and
hence
it
seemed
proper
that
they
should
be
chosen
by
the
body
which
acts
for
the
state
in
its
corporate
capacity
second
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
being
elected
by
the
people
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
elect
the
senators
in
a
different
way
in
order
that
by
representing
different
elements
each
house
might
act
as
a
check
upon
the
other
incidentally
election
by
the
legislature
was
considered
good
because
it
would
serve
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
states
and
the
united
states
the
long
term
gives
dignity
and
independence
to
the
position
of
senator
it
gives
assurance
of
stability
in
the
national
councils
and
tends
to
secure
for
them
confidence
at
home
and
respect
abroad
it
raises
senators
above
the
whims
and
caprices
of
their
constituents
so
that
they
may
consult
their
solid
interests
rather
than
their
immediate
wishes
under
the
confederation
each
state
had
from
two
to
seven
members
of
congress
but
only
one
vote
if
the
delegation
was
equally
divided
on
any
question
or
if
only
one
member
was
present
the
state
lost
its
vote
by
the
present
arrangement
a
state
need
not
go
entirely
unrepresented
on
account
of
the
absence
of
one
of
its
senators
classification
and
after
they
shall
be
assembled
in
consequence
of
the
first
election
they
shall
be
divided
as
equally
as
may
be
into
three
classes
the
seats
of
the
senators
of
the
first
class
shall
be
vacated
at
the
expiration
of
the
second
year
of
the
second
class
at
the
expiration
of
the
fourth
year
and
of
the
third
class
at
the
expiration
of
the
sixth
year
so
that
may
be
chosen
every
second
year
and
if
vacancies
happen
by
resignation
or
otherwise
during
the
recess
of
the
legislature
of
any
state
the
executive
thereof
may
make
temporary
appointments
until
the
next
meeting
of
the
legislature
which
shall
then
fill
such
vacancies
the
object
of
this
division
is
to
secure
for
the
senate
at
all
times
a
large
proportion
of
experienced
members
by
this
arrangement
too
the
senate
becomes
a
permanent
body
ready
at
any
time
to
convene
for
the
consideration
of
treaties
for
the
trial
of
impeachments
or
for
confirming
executive
appointments
only
ten
states
were
represented
when
on
may
this
classification
was
first
made
north
carolina
and
rhode
island
had
not
yet
ratified
the
constitution
and
new
york
senators
had
not
yet
presented
their
credentials
the
twenty
senators
had
on
the
preceding
day
been
grouped
by
name
into
three
classes
two
of
seven
senators
each
and
one
of
six
by
the
drawing
of
three
numbered
slips
of
paper
seven
fell
into
class
seven
into
class
and
six
into
class
with
terms
ending
march
and
respectively
after
the
classification
had
been
fixed
the
two
senators
from
new
york
appeared
one
was
placed
by
lot
in
class
thus
filling
the
classes
and
then
the
other
also
by
lot
in
class
the
two
senators
from
the
next
state
north
carolina
were
therefore
placed
in
the
unfilled
classes
and
since
each
class
holds
for
six
years
and
a
senator
term
expires
with
that
of
his
class
senators
represent
the
state
and
are
elected
by
the
body
which
acts
for
the
state
by
the
legislature
if
in
session
temporarily
by
the
governor
if
it
is
not
person
shall
be
a
senator
who
shall
not
have
attained
to
the
age
of
thirty
years
and
been
nine
years
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
who
shall
not
when
elected
be
an
inhabitant
of
that
state
from
which
he
shall
be
chosen
this
was
also
the
age
for
eligibility
to
the
roman
senate
it
is
five
years
more
than
the
requirement
for
membership
in
the
house
two
years
of
citizenship
more
than
required
of
a
representative
as
the
senate
acts
with
the
president
in
making
treaties
this
requirement
seems
none
too
great
the
propriety
of
this
is
i
presiding
of
the
united
states
shall
be
president
of
the
senate
but
shall
have
no
vote
unless
they
be
equally
divided
this
arrangement
was
made
for
three
reasons
first
it
would
give
the
something
to
do
second
partaking
in
the
executive
business
of
the
senate
would
give
the
excellent
training
for
the
duties
of
the
presidency
in
case
he
should
be
called
thereto
third
the
equality
of
power
among
the
states
would
remain
undisturbed
had
it
been
arranged
that
the
senate
should
choose
its
own
presiding
officer
from
among
its
members
one
state
might
thereby
gain
or
lose
power
in
the
senate
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
senate
for
this
reason
also
he
can
not
take
part
in
debates
nor
can
he
appoint
committees
these
are
elected
by
the
senate
itself
but
for
his
casting
vote
a
might
occur
on
some
important
question
this
might
give
rise
to
dangerous
feuds
or
intrigues
and
create
state
or
national
agitations
other
senate
shall
choose
their
other
officers
and
also
a
president
pro
tempore
in
the
absence
of
the
or
when
he
shall
exercise
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
these
are
similar
to
those
of
the
house
see
p
the
president
is
chosen
from
among
the
senators
being
a
senator
he
can
debate
and
vote
upon
any
question
he
can
not
of
course
give
a
casting
vote
because
that
would
virtually
give
him
two
votes
the
president
serves
during
the
pleasure
of
the
senate
or
until
the
expiration
of
his
senatorial
term
it
is
the
general
practice
for
the
to
vacate
his
chair
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
to
permit
the
senate
to
chose
a
president
so
that
if
during
vacation
the
should
become
president
the
senate
might
not
be
without
a
presiding
officer
until
recently
this
was
quite
important
for
the
president
of
the
senate
was
next
to
the
in
the
succession
to
the
presidency
but
the
succession
has
been
changed
see
p
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachments
when
sitting
for
that
purpose
they
shall
be
on
oath
or
affirmation
when
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
tried
the
chief
justice
shall
preside
and
no
person
shall
be
convicted
without
the
concurrence
of
of
the
members
present
judgement
in
cases
of
impeachment
shall
not
extend
further
than
to
removal
from
office
and
disqualification
to
hold
and
enjoy
any
office
of
honor
trust
or
profit
under
the
united
sates
but
the
party
convicted
shall
nevertheless
be
liable
and
subject
to
indictment
trial
judgment
and
punishment
according
to
law
for
the
mode
of
conducting
impeachments
see
pages
and
to
have
impeachments
tried
by
a
court
of
law
would
be
unwise
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
judges
should
be
kept
free
from
political
contests
in
order
that
they
may
retain
the
proper
judicial
frame
of
mind
in
the
second
place
judges
are
appointed
by
the
executive
who
may
be
the
one
impeached
lastly
a
judge
is
himself
subject
to
impeachment
to
enhance
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
the
british
house
of
lords
when
sitting
as
a
high
court
of
impeachment
is
not
under
oath
but
courts
usually
are
the
having
interest
in
the
result
would
be
disqualified
the
chief
justice
from
the
dignity
of
his
station
and
his
great
experience
in
law
seems
the
fittest
person
to
preside
on
such
a
grave
occasion
except
in
this
single
instance
however
the
presides
in
trials
on
impeachment
in
an
ordinary
court
the
verdict
of
the
jury
must
be
unanimous
to
require
similar
agreement
in
this
case
would
be
to
make
it
next
to
impossible
ever
to
convict
to
allow
a
bare
majority
to
convict
would
be
to
place
too
little
protection
over
a
public
officer
but
for
this
provision
abuses
of
power
might
occur
in
times
of
political
excitement
and
strife
the
question
which
the
senate
settles
is
simply
whether
in
view
of
the
evidence
the
accused
is
or
is
not
worthy
to
hold
public
office
this
provision
was
inserted
to
prevent
an
official
who
had
been
deposed
for
crime
from
pleading
the
principle
that
no
one
can
be
twice
tried

punished

may

compel
the

in

manner
and
under
such
penalties
as
each
house
may
provide
this
means
simply
that
each
house
has
the
power
to
determine
who
are
entitled
to
membership
in
it
this
has
long
been
recognized
in
free
countries
as
a
right
belonging
to
a
legislative
body
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
its
independence
and
purity
even
its
existence
but
when
the
parties
are
nearly
balanced
the
majority
is
tempted
to
seat
its
this
is
the
number
usually
established
as
a
quorum
for
a
deliberative
body
certainly
no
smaller
number
should
have
a
right
to
transact
business
for
that
would
give
too
much
power
to
an
active
minority
and
to
require
more
than
a
majority
would
make
it
possible
for
a
minority
to
prevent
legislation

the
rules
are
intended
to
facilitate
business
by
preventing
confusion
and
unnecessary
delay
they
are
designed
also
to
check
undue
haste
the
rules
of
each

are
based
upon
the
english
parliamentary
practice
as
are
the
rules
of
all
legislative
or
deliberative
bodies
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
see
manuals
of
senate
and
house
it
seems
unlikely
that
even
in
times
of
great
excitement
of
either
house
would
favor
expulsion

judgment
require

this
is
to
give
publicity
to
the
proceedings
of
congress
for
the
benefit
of
both
legislators
and
constituents
this
provision
is
a
valuable
one
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
demagogues
are
sometimes
able
thereby
to
gain
cheap
glory
to
give
still
further
publicity

the
proceedings
spectators

the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
make

preserved
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
number
necessary
to
secure
the
record
is
small
while
this
provision
is
intended
to
protect
the
minority
by
enabling
them
to
impose
responsibility
upon
the
majority
it
is
open
to
abuse
it
is
sometimes
used
by
a
minority

unnecessarily

he
can
be
checked
by
his
house
if
necessary
and
the
offensive
matter
omitted
from

record
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
not
to
shield
cowards
in
speaking
ill
of
persons
who
do
not
deserve
reproach
but
to
protect
members
in
exposing
iniquity
no
matter

the
doers
of
it
may
be
intrenched
in
wealth
or
power
senator
or
representative
shall
during

for
which
he
was
elected
be
appointed
to
any
civil
office
under

authority
of
the
united
states
which
shall
have
been
created
or
the
emoluments
whereof
shall
have
been
increased

no
person
holding
any
office
under
the
united
states
shall
be
a
member
of
either
house
during
his
continuance
in
office
the
obvious
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
remove
from
members
of
congress
the
temptation
to
create
offices
with
large
salaries
for
their
own
benefit
or
to
increase
for
a
similar
reason
the
salaries
of
offices
already
existing
it
was
designed
also
to
secure
congress
from
undue
influence
on
the
part
of
the
president
the
wisdom
of
the
provision
has
however
been
seriously
questioned
as
there
is
a
degree
of
depravity
in
mankind
which
requires
a
certain
degree
of
circumspection
and
distrust
so
there
are
other
qualities
in
human
nature
which
justify
a
certain
portion
of
esteem
and
confidence
republican
government
presupposes
the
existence
of
these
qualities
in
a
higher
form
than
any
other
it
might
well
be
deemed
harsh
to
disqualify
an
individual
from
any
office
clearly
required
by
the
exigencies
of
the
country
simply
because
he
had
done
his
duty
the
chances
of
receiving
an
appointment
to
a
new
office
are
not
so
many
or
so
enticing
as
to
bewilder
many
minds
and
if
they
are
the
aberrations
from
duty
are
so
easily
traced
that
they
rarely
if
ever
escape
the
public
reproaches
and
if
influence
is
to
be
exerted
by
the
executive
for
improper
purposes
it
will
be
quite
as
easy
and
its
operation
less
seen
and
less
suspected
to
give
the
stipulated
patronage
in
another
form

this
was
to
obviate

may
originate
in

the
two
great
purposes
of
giving
the
president
a
negative
upon
legislative
acts
are
to
protect
the
proper
authority
of
the
executive
from
the
encroachments
of
the
congress
and
to
interpose
a
stay
on
hasty
legislation
the
veto
of
the
roman
tribune
was
final
as
is
that
of
almost
every
european
sovereign
today
no
british
king
or
queen
has
vetoed
an
act
of
parliament
in
the
last
hundred
and
eighty
in
norway
if
a
bill
vetoed
by
the
king
passes
three
successive
storthings
it
becomes
a
law
to
secure
a
permanent
record
for
future
reference
this
helps
to
render
members
careful
how
they
vote
this
gives
due
time
for
consideration
but
prevents
the
killing
a
bill
by
ignoring
or
neglecting
it
thus
congress
which
has
the
very
human
failing
of
putting
off
or
postponing
can
not
break
down
the
veto
power
of
the
president
by
pouring
an
avalanche
of
bills
upon
him
within
the
last
few
days
of
the
session
but
the
president
can
easily
kill
any
bill
which
he
does
not
like
if
it
is
presented
within
ten
days
of
the
adjournment
of
congress
simply
by
keeping
it
this
is
called
pocketing
a
bill
or
the
pocket
veto
joint
order
resolution
or
vote
to
which
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
may
be
necessary
except
on
a
question
of
adjournment
shall
be
presented
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
before
the
same
shall
take
effect
shall
be
approved
by
him
or
being
disapproved
by
him
shall
be
repassed
by
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
according
to
the
rules
and
limitations
prescribed
in
the
case
of
a
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
prevent
congress
from
passing
a
law
under
some
other
name
the
resolution
to
adjourn
is
excepted
because
as
we
have
seen
the
time
for
adjournment
is
generally
a
matter
of
agreement
between
the
houses
a
resolution
passed
by
the
two
houses
but
not
intended
to
have
the
force
of
law
such
as
an
agreement
to
do
something
is
called
a
concurrent
resolution
and
does
not
require
the
president
signature
what
is
a
bill

is
meant
by
entering
the
objections
at
large
why
is
there
no
committee
of
ways
and
means
in

how
many
members
in

house
does
it
take
for
the
first
passage
of

many
after
the

does
the
expression
refer
to
the
entire
number
in
a
house
or
to
the
number

three
ways
in
which
a
bill
may
become
a
law
five
ways
in
which
it
may
fail
during
what
time

the
president
the
equivalent
of
an
absolute

a
resolution
merely
expressing
an
of
either
or
both
houses
need
the
president
signature
does
a
resolution
proposing
an
amendment
to
the
constitution

the
president
bound
to
enforce

law

over
his
veto
we
have
now
completed
the
review
of
the
structure
and
organization
of
the
legislative
department
and
it
has
been
shown
that
it
is
admirably
adapted
for
a
wholesome
and
upright
exercise
of
the
powers
confided
to
it
all
the
checks
which
human
ingenuity
has
been
able

devise

the
want
of
power
in
congress
to
impose
taxes
was
perhaps
the
greatest
defect
of
the
articles
of
confederation
therefore
in
the
constitution
this
was
the
first
power
granted
to
congress
as
usually
interpreted
the
phrase
beginning
to
pay
the
debts
is
intended
to
state
the
purposes
for
which
taxes
may
be
levied
but
this
limitation
is
merely
theoretical
for
taxes
are
levied
before
being
expended
this

of

ordinarily
for
congress
to
exercise
this
power
but
in
times
of
war
the
regular
sources
of
income
may
not
be
sufficient
hence
the
necessity
of
this
power
to
provide
for
extraordinary
expenses
it
is
one
of
the
prerogatives
of

of
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
and

the
power
to
regulate

implies
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
for
traffic
and
navigation
and
to
do
such
things
as
are
necessary
to
render
them
safe
it
has
been
interpreted
to
cover
among
other
things
the
imposition
of

the
designation
of
ports
of

the
removal
of

in

and

and

and
the

the
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
should
go
hand
in
hand
with
that
of
regulating
commerce
among
the
states
this
power
had
under
the
confederation
been
in
the
hands
of
the
several
states
their
jealousies
and
rivalries
had
led
to
retaliatory
measures
upon
each
other
this
condition
of
affairs
was
encouraged
by
other
nations
because
they
profited
by
it
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
business
was
terribly
depressed
and
the
bitterness
of
feeling
among
the
states
would
probably
soon
have
disrupted
the
union
therefore
to
insure
domestic
tranquility
and
to
promote
the
general
welfare
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
was
delegated
to
the
general
government
this
control
is
exercised
even
when
the
indians
live
within
the
boundaries
of
a
state
by
placing
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
indians
in
the
hands
of
the
general
government
it
was
hoped
that
uniformity
of
regulations
and
the
strength
of
the
government
would
secure
peace
and
safety

when
metals
were
first
used
as
money
they
were
weighed
and
their
purity
was
determined
by
testing
this

fraud
for
convenience
in
business
transactions
these
are
coined
of
certain
sizes
to
discourage
the
mutilation
of
coins
for
sinister
purposes
they
are
milled
on
the
edges
and
the
stamp
covers
each
face
so
that
the
metal
could
hardly
be
cut
off
without
the
coin
showing
defacement
the
value
is
shown
by
the
stamp
otherwise
foreign
coin
would
become
an
article
of
commerce
and
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
regulate
the
value
of

congress
has
never
exercised

the

may
be

under

denies
that

the
wisdom
of
granting

becomes
apparent
when
we
consider
how
poorly
the
end
might
be
secured

the

is
one
of
the
attributes
of

if
this

were
in
the

of
the

any
one
of
them
could
at
any
time
involve
the
whole
country
in
the
calamities
of
war
against
the
wishes
of
all
the
other
states
with
all
their
fear
of
the
general
government
shown
in
the
character
of
the
articles
of
confederation
the
people
in
framing
that
instrument
saw
the
necessity
of
vesting
this
power
in
the
general
government
in
monarchies
the
power
to
declare
war
is
generally
vested
in
the
executive
but
in
a
republic
it
would
be
dangerous
to
the
interests
and
even
the
liberties
of
the
people
to
entrust
this
power
to
the
president
to
put
the
thought
in
other
words
the
power
to
declare
war
belongs
to
the
sovereign
in
this
country
the
people
are
sovereign
therefore
the
power
to
declare
war
belongs
to
the
people
and
they
act
through
their
representative
body
congress
see
pages
these
are
commissions
granted
to
private
persons
usually
in

of

authorizing
the
bearer
to
pass
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
own
country
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
the
property
of
an
enemy
sometimes
such
a
letter
is
granted
in
times
of
peace
to
redress
a
grievance
to
a
private
citizen
which
the
offending
nation
refuses
to
redress
by
authority
of
such
a
commission
the

individual
may

raise
and
support
armies
but
no
appropriation
of
money
to
that
use
shall
be
for
a
longer
term
than
two
years
this
is
another
sovereign
power
and
would
seem
the
necessary
accompaniment
of
the
power
to
declare
war
under
the
confederation
however
congress
could
only
designate
the
quota
of
men
which
each
state
ought
to
raise
and
the
actual
enlistment
of
men
was
done
by
the
several
states
their
experience
in
carrying
on
the
revolutionary
war
on
that
basis
satisfied
them
that
efficiency
and
economy
would
both
be
secured
by
vesting
this
power
in
the
general
government
but
to
prevent
misuse
of
the
power
this
proviso
was
inserted
as
representatives
are
elected
every
two
years
the
people
can
promptly
check
any
attempt
to
maintain
an
unnecessarily
large
army
in
times
of
peace
a
standing
army
is
dangerous
to
liberty
because
it
is
commanded
by
the
executive
to
whom
it
yields
unquestioning
obedience
armies
obey
while
citizens
comply
with
and
thus
a
large
standing
army
creates
a
out
of
sympathy
with
the
lives
of
citizens
more
than
one
republic
has
been
overthrown
by
a
successful
military
leader
supported
by
a
devoted
army
as
a
matter
of
fact
congress
makes
the
appropriation
annually
the
provide
and
maintain
a
the
navy
is
necessary
to
protect
fisheries
and
commerce
and
in
times
of
war
the
navy
is
needed
to
protect
our
sea
coast
to
transport
soldiers
to
cripple
the
enemy
resources
and
to
render
blockades
effectual
it
will
be
noticed
that
there
is
no
limitation
upon
appropriations
for
the
navy
this
is
for
two
general
reasons
first
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
a
navy
no
nation
was
ever
deprived
of
its
liberty
by
its
navy
second
it
takes
time
to
provide
a
navy
and
it
should
therefore
be
kept
at
all
times
in
a
state
of
efficiency

in
a
soldier
or

and
refusal
to
pay
just
debts
or
any
other
conduct
unbecoming
to
a
gentleman
are
punishable
offenses
in
an
officer
thus
it
is
seen
that
military
law
takes
cognizance
of
offenses
not
usually
noticed
by
civil
law
the
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of

insurrections
and

congress
has
declared
the
militia
to
be
all
citizens
and
those
who
have
declared
their
intention
to
become
such
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
these
constitute
what
is
called
the
unorganized
militia
the
military
companies
and
regiments
formed
by
authority
of
united
states
and
state
laws
constitute
the
organized
militia
one
of
two
policies
we
must
pursue
either
to
maintain
a
large
standing
army
or
to
depend
upon
the
to
meet
emergencies
for
several
reasons
we
prefer
the
latter
that
our
may
be
depended
upon
has
been
demonstrated
on
many
a
battlefield
the
clause
specifies
the
purposes
for
which
the
militia
may
be
called
out
these
are
three
in
number
each
state
may
for
similar
purposes
call
forth
its
own
militia
under
the
laws
of
congress
the
president
is
authorized
in
certain
emergencies
to
issue
the
call
this
he
directs
to
the
governors
of
states
and
those
called
on
are
bound
to
furnish
the
troops
required
on
three
occasions
only
have
the
militia
been
called
out
under
this
clause

the
whisky

to
enforce
the

to

states
respectively
the
appointment
of

and
the

according
to

thus
only
can
the

so
essential
to

this
is
designed
as
a

of
the
right
of

to
have

and
to
control

only
to

directly
until

three
years
the
experiment
was
tried
of
governing
it
as
a

the
territorial
government
in
that
time
ran
in

supervision
of

is
now
in

the

cooley
constitutional
limitations
the
term
is
here
used
in
its
generic
sense
so
as
to
include
bills
of
pains
and
penalties
the
great
objection
to
of
attainder
is
that
they
are
purely
acts
performed
by
a
body
a
legislative
body
may
and
should
try
a
offense
and
render
a
verdict
as
to
the
worthiness
of
the
accused
to
hold
public
office

to
try
him
when
conviction
would
deprive
him
of
any
of
his
personal
rights
life
liberty
or
property
should
be
the
work
of
a
duly
organized
body
this
provision
then
is
directed
not
so
much
against
the
penalty
for
limitations
upon
penalties
are
found
elsewhere
in
the
constitution
as
against
the
mode
of
trial
or
we
may
say
that
it
is
intended
to
prevent
conviction
a
trial
for
in
previous
times
legislative
bodies
had
frequently
punished
political
enemies
without
even
the
form
of
a
trial
or
without
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
their
own
defense
by
passing
against
them
bills
of
attainder
an
post
law
is
literally
one
which
acts
back
upon
a
deed
previously
performed
but
as
here
intended
it
means
a
law
making
such
an
act
either
by
declaring
criminal
that
which
was
not
so
regarded
in
law
when
committed
or
by
increasing
the
penalty
and
applying
it
to
the
act
previously
performed
but
a
law
may
be
passed
making
in
a
sense
some
previous
act
that
is
an
unforseen
but
imperative
necessity
may
call
for
the
doing
of
something
which

the
things
forbidden
by
this
clause
would
if
permitted
render
unsafe
all
those
personal
rights

the
security
of

the
constitution
was
framed

government
founded

this
clause
emphasizes
the
first
sentence
of
clause
three
section
two
of
this
article
it
was
to
prevent
the
taxation
of
the
of
the
not
enumerated
for
representation
and
was
evidently
inserted
as
a
concession
to
the
slave
states
but
the
abolition
of
slavery
takes
from
the
clause
all
force
except
that
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
paragraph
no
capitation
tax
that
is
so
much
has
ever
been
levied
by
the
general
government
duties
on

or
duty
shall
be
laid
on
articles
exported
from
any
this
was
designed
to
prevent
discrimination
against
any
state
or
section
though
the
question
has
never
been
judicially
determined
it
is
generally
understood
that
since
anything
exported
must
be
exported
from
some
state
or
territory
this
clause
prohibits
export
duties
commercial
preference
shall
be
given
by
any
regulation
of
commerce
or
revenue
to
the
ports
of
one
state
over
those
of
another
nor
shall
vessels
bound
to
or
from
one
state

obliged
to

or
pay
duties
in
this
provision
has
the
same
object
in
view
as
that
which
requires
duties
to
be
uniform
the
impartial
treatment
of
the
several
states
it
shows
too
the
fear
felt
by
many
that
the
general
government
show
partiality
the
latter
part
of
the
clause
virtually
establishes
free
trade
among
the
states
care
of
public
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
and
a
regular
statement
and
account
of
the
receipts
and
expenditures
of
all
public
money
shall
he
published
from
time
to
there
are
two
great
purposes
to
be
subserved
by
this
provision
first
to
impose
upon
those
handling
the
money
a
feeling
of
responsibility
and
thus
to
increase
the
probability
of
carefulness
second
to
prevent
the
use
of
public
funds
for
any
purpose
except
those
authorized
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
this
is
in
harmony
with
the
provision
which
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
raise
money
incidentally
too
this
is
a
protector
of
our
liberties
those
who
have
charge
of
the
public
purse
are
appointees
of
the
president
but
for
this
provision
he
might
as
rulers
in
arbitrary
governments
do
use
the
public
treasury
to
accomplish
his
own
private
purposes
and
one
of
these
purposes
might
be
the
overthrow
of
our
liberties
this
thought
undoubtedly
was
a
prominent
one
in
the
minds
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
the
account
of
receipts
and
expenditures
is
reported
to
congress
annually
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
titles
of
no
title
of
nobility
shall
be
granted
by
the
united
states
and
no
person
holding
an
office
of
profit
or
trust
under
them
shall
without
the
consent
of
the
congress
accept
of
any
present
emolument
office
or
title
of
any
kind
whatever
from
any
king
prince
or
foreign
state
this
is
in
harmony
with
the
principle
all
men
are
created
equal
and
while
in
society
there
are
classes
and
grades
based
upon
learning
wealth
we
intend
that
all
shall
be
equal
before
the
law
that
there
shall
be
no
privileged
classes
the
purpose
of
this
is
evident
to
free
public
officers
from
blandishments
which
are
many
times
the
precursors
of
temptations
to
treason
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
was
proposed
in
prohibiting
any
citizen
from
receiving
any
kind
of
office
or
present
from
a
foreign
power
but
it
was
not
ratified

or

or
grant
any
title
of
nobility
otherwise
the
intrigues
of
foreign
nations
would
soon
break
up
the
union
had
the
states
this
power
it
would
be
possible
for
any
one
of
them
to
involve
the
whole
country
in
war
this
provision
secures
the
uniformity
and
reliability
of
our
coinage
a
state
may
borrow
money
and
may
issue
bonds
for
the
purpose
but
these
bonds
are
not
bills
of
credit
because
they
are
not
designed
to
circulate
as
money
the
evils
of
state
issuance
of
bills
of
credit
we
can
not
appreciate
but
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
experienced
them
and
based
this
provision
on
that
bitter
experience
this
has
the
same
general
purpose
as
the
preceding
it
will
be
observed
that
there
is
no
such
prohibition
on
the
united
states
and
the
implied
power
to
emit
bills
of
credit
and
to
make
things
other
than
gold
and
silver
legal
tender
has
been
exercised
forbidden
to
the
states
for
the
same
reason
that
they
are
forbidden
to
the
united
states
the
purpose
is
to
preserve
the
legal
obligation
of
contracts
the
spirit
of
the
provision
is
this
a
contract
which
is
legally
binding
upon
the
parties
at
the
time
and
place
it
is
entered
into
by
them
shall
remain
so
any
law
of
the
states
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
footnote
tiffany
quoted

under
this
provision
many
questions
have
arisen
one
of
them
is
this
may
a

or
bankrupt
laws
it
has
been
decided
by
the

supreme
court
that
a

not

no

to
consumers
quality

in
some
states
there
is

commissioner
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
that
no
substance
is
offered
for
sale
as
butter
which
is
not
butter
and
officers
may
be
appointed
to
inspect
the
weights
and
measures
in
stores
such
officers
may
be
provided
for
without
the
consent
of
congress
but
no
fees
can
be
charged
for
this
service
more
than
are
necessary
to
pay
the
officers
in
other
words
the
offices
can
not
be
made
a
source
of
revenue
to
the
state
this
is
to
free
the
states
from
any
temptation
to
use
the
power
which
might
be
conferred
under
this
clause
for
their
own
gain
to
the
detriment
of
a
sister
state
this
secures
to
congress
the
control
of
the
matter
that
is
a
tax
upon
the
carrying
power
of
a
ship
this
is
in
harmony
with
the
provision
which
forbids
the
states
to
levy
duties
on
imports
this
prohibits
the
keeping
of
a
standing
army
but
each
state
may
have
its
organized
militia
in
the
preceding
clause
the
states
are
forbidden
to
enter
into
treaties
that
is
into
compacts
and
the
prohibition
is
absolute
here
they
are
prohibited
from
entering
into
compacts
unless
permitted
by
congress
for
a
state
to
engage
in
war
would
be
to
embroil
the
country
in
war
but
the
militia
might
be
sent
to
repel
invasion
they
would
however
be
defending
not
the
state
simply
but
also
the
united
states
we
have
thus
passed
through
the
positive
prohibitions
introduced
upon
the
powers
of
the
states
it
will
be
observed
that
they
divide
themselves
into
two
classes
those
which
are
political
in
their
character
as
an
exercise
of
sovereignty
and
those
which
more
especially
regard
the
private
rights
of
individuals
in
the
latter
the
prohibition
is
absolute
and
universal
in
the
former
it
is
sometimes
absolute
and
sometimes
subjected
to
the
consent
of
congress
it
will
at
once
be
perceived
how
full
of
difficulty
and
delicacy
the
task
was
to
reconcile
the
jealous
tenacity
of
the
states
over
their
own
sovereignty
with
the
permanent
security
of
the
national
government
and
the
inviolability
of
private
rights
the
task
has
been
accomplished
with
eminent
success

in

paragraph

chapter
xxiii
article
the
executive
branch
it
seems
to
us
a
matter
of
course
that
after
the
laws
are
made
there
should
be
some
person
or
persons
whose
duty
it
should
be
to
carry
them
into
execution
but
it
will
be
remembered
that
under
the
confederation
there
was
no
executive
department
the
colonists
had
suffered
from
kingly
rule
and
in
forming
their
first
government
after
independence
they
naturally
avoided
anything
having
the
appearance
of
kingliness
after
trying
their
experiment
for
some
years
however
their
sober
second
sense
told
them
that
the
executive
branch
is
a
necessity
and
when
the
convention
assembled
to
revise
the
articles
of
confederation
as
they
at
first
intended
to
do
one
of
the
things
upon
which
there
was
practical
unanimity
of
opinion
was
the
necessity
of
having
the
government
organized
into
three
branches
or
as
they
are
sometimes
called
departments
the
question
in
regard
to
the
executive
branch
was
how
to
organize
it
so
as
to
secure
two
chief
qualities
namely
energy
of
execution
and
safety
to
the
people
the
former
was
fully
appreciated
for
the
weakness
of
execution
during
the
confederation
period
or
the
lack
of
execution
had
impressed
upon
all
thinking
persons
the
necessity
of
more
vigor
in
carrying
out
the
laws
the
experience
during
colonial
days
emphasized
the
necessity
of
surrounding
the
office
with
proper
safeguards
and
among
those
intrusted
with
the
organization
of
a
scheme
of
government
were
many
who
were
well
versed
in
history
men
who
knew
that
the
executive
branch
is
the
one
in
which
lies
the
menace
to
human
liberty
under
these
two
main
divisions
of
the
problem
arose
such
questions
as
how
many
persons
shall
constitute
the
executive
what
shall
the
term
be
how
shall
the
executive
be
chosen
what
powers
other
than
those
which
are
purely
executive
shall
be
vested
in
this
branch
how
shall
this
branch
be
held
responsible
without
crippling
its
efficiency
how
well
the
problem
was
solved
we
shall
find
out
in
our
study
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
pertaining
to
this
branch
section
election
and
service
vestment
of
executive
power
shall
be
vested
in
a
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
he
shall
hold
his
office
during
the
term
of
four
years
and
together
with
the
chosen
for
the
same
term
shall
be
elected
as
follows
this
sentence
answers
the
question
how
many
persons
shall
constitute
the
executive
and
gives
the
official
title
thereof
the
executive
authority
is
vested
in
one
person
for
two
chief
reasons
to
secure
energy
in
execution
and
to
impose
upon
the
executive
a
sense
of
responsibility
if
the
executive
power
were
vested
in
a
number
of
persons
the
differences
and
jealousies
sure
to
arise
and
the
absence
of
responsibility
would
result
in
a
feeble
administration
which
is
but
another
name
for
a
bad
administration
the
term
first
reported
by
the
committee
of
the
whole
was
seven
years
with
the
provision
forbidding
some
of
the
delegates
were
in
favor
of
annual
elections
while
others
thought
that
the
executive
should
be
elected
for
life
or
good
behavior
and
other
terms
varying
from
two
to
ten
years
had
their
advocates
after
much
discussion
the
term
of
four
years
was
agreed
upon
as
a
compromise
and
no
limitation
was
put
upon
the
number
of
terms
for
which
a
person
might
be
elected
in
another
place
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
president
to
recommended
to
congress
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
country
he
should
therefore
have
a
term
long
enough
to
fairly
test
his
policy
and
to
stimulate
him
to
personal
firmness
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
yet
not
so
long
as
to
free
him
from
a
sense
of
responsibility
it
was
thought
that
a
term
of
four
years
would
cover
both
of
the
conditions
mentioned
the
purpose
of
having
a
is
to
provide
a
successor
for
the
president
in
case
of
his
disability
or
death
choosing
the
president
and
number
and
appointment
of
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct
a
number
of
electors
equal
to
the
whole
number
of
senators
and
representatives
to
which
the
state
may
be
entitled
in
the
congress
but
no
senator
or
representative
or
person
holding
an
office
of
trust
or
profit
under
the
united
states
shall
be
appointed
an
three
plans
for
the
election
of
president
and
were
proposed
first
election
by
congress
second
election
by
the
people
third
election
by
persons
chosen
by
the
people
for
that
special
purpose
the
objection
to
the
first
plan
was
that
it
would
rob
the
executive
branch
of
that
independence
which
in
our
plan
of
government
it
is
designed
to
possess
it
would
render
the
executive
branch
in
a
measure
subordinate
to
the
legislative
the
objections
to
the
second
plan
came
from
two
sources
some
of
the
delegates
feared
that
inexperienced
as
they
were
the
people
could
not
be
trusted
to
act
wisely
in
the
choice
of
a
president
that
they
would
be
swayed
by
partizan
feeling
instead
of
acting
with
cool
deliberation
and
the
small
states
feared
that
in
a
popular
election
their
power
would
count
for
little
then
the
compromise
in
the
organization
of
the
congress
was
remembered
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
election
of
the
president
and
should
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
persons
chosen
for
that
special
purpose
and
that
the
number
of
the
electors
from
each
state
should
be
that
of
its
representation
in
congress
this
satisfied
both
parties
those
who
thought
that
the
people
could
not
be
intrusted
with
so
important
a
matter
as
the
choice
of
the
president
hoped
that
this
mode
would
place
the
election
in
the
hands
of
the
wise
men
of
the
several
states
and
the
delegates
from
the
small
states
secured
in
this
all
the
concession
which
they
could
fairly
ask
this
matter
being
settled
the
next
question
was
how
shall
the
electors
be
chosen
there
being
much
difference
of
opinion
on
the
subject
it
was
thought
best
to
let
each
state
choose
its
electors
in
the
way
which
it
might
prefer
naturally
the
modes
of
choosing
electors
varied
in
some
states
the
legislature
chose
them
but
this
mode
soon
became
unpopular
footnote
south
carolina
however
retained
this
mode
until
very
recently
in
some
states
they
were
chosen
by
the
people
on
a
general
ticket
and
in
others
by
the
people
by
congressional
districts
the
last
is
the
fairest
way
because
it
most
nearly
represents
the
wishes
of
the
people
by
electing
on
a
general
ticket
the
party
which
is
in
the
majority
in
any
state
can
elect
of
the
electors
but
for
this
very
reason
the
majority
in
each
state
has
finally
arranged
the
matter
so
that
this
is
now
the
practice
in
nearly
all
the
states
the
present
system
of
nominations
and
pledged
electors
was
undreamed
of
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
they
intended
that
in
the
selection
of
the
president
each
elector
should
be
free
to
vote
according
to
his
own
best
judgment
but
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
electors
simply
register
a
verdict
already
rendered
briefly
the
history
of
the
change
is
this
during
the
administration
of
washington
who
had
been
elected
unanimously
differences
of
opinion
on
questions
of
policy
gave
rise
to
political
parties
to
secure
the
unity
of
action
so
essential
to
success
the
leaders
of
the
respective
parties
by
agreement
among
themselves
designated
as
each
election
approached
persons
whom
they
recommended
for
support
by
electors
of
their
party
gradually
the
recommendation
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
binding
in
the
party
having
no
members
of
congress
to
act
as
leaders
held
a
people
convention
its
nominees
received
a
surprisingly
large
vote
the
popularity
of
this
mode
of
nomination
thus
appearing
the
other
parties
gradually
adopted
it
and
since
it
has
remained
a
recognized
part
of
our
political
machinery
election
of
president
and
electors
shall
meet
in
their
respective
states
and
vote
by

for
two
persons
of
whom
one
at

shall
not
be
an
inhabitant
of
the

with
themselves
and
they
shall
make
a
list
of
all
the
persons
voted
for
and
the
number
of
votes
for
each
which
list
they
shall
sign
and
certify
and
transmit
sealed
to
the
seat
of
the

of
the

directed
to
the

of
the

the

of
the
senate
shall
in
the
presence
of
the
senate
and
house
of

open
all
the

and
the
votes
shall
then
be
counted
the
person
having
the
greatest
number
of

shall
be
president
if
such
number
be
a

of
the
whole

appointed
and
if
there
be
more
than
one
who
have
such
a

and
have
an
equal
number
of

then
the

shall

of

have
a

then
from

highest
on

but
if
there
should
remain
two
or
more
who
have
equal
votes
the
senate
shall
choose
from
them
by
ballot
the
under
this
provision
washington
was
elected
president
twice
and
adams
once
in
the
disputed
election
of
it
was
found
that
this
mode
would
not
do
the
faulty
feature
in
the
plan
is
found
in
the
first
sentence
which
requires
the
electors
to
vote
for
two
persons
for
president
in
this
election
jefferson
and
burr
candidates
of
the
same
party
received
the
same
number
of
votes
and
each
had
a
majority
the
power
to
choose
then
devolved
upon
the
house
of
representatives
there
were
at
that
time
sixteen
states
and
consequently
sixteen
votes
of
these
jefferson
received
eight
burr
six
and
the
remaining
two
were
scattering
as
it
required
nine
votes
to
make
a
majority
no
one
was
elected
the
balloting
was
continued
for
seven
days
ballots
being
taken
on
the
ballot
jefferson
received
ten
votes
to
four
for
burr
jefferson
thus
became
president
and
burr
but
the
consequent
bitterness
of
feeling
was
much
regretted
and
it
was
determined
to
change
slightly
the
mode
of
election
the
changes
consisted
in
having
the
electors
vote
for
one
person
for
president
and
for
a
different
person
for
and
when
the
election
is
thrown
into
the
house
of
representatives
the
selection
is
to
be
made
from
the
highest
instead
of
the
highest
as
originally
the
change
was
made
by
the
twelfth
amendment
passed
in
which
is
here
given
in
full
twelfth
electors
shall
meet
in
their
respective
states
and
vote
by
ballot
for
president
and
one
of
whom
at
least
shall
not
be
an
inhabitant
of
the
same
state
with
themselves
they
shall
name
in
their
ballots
the
person
voted
for
as
president
and
in
distinct
ballots
the
person
voted
for
as
and
they
shall
make
distinct
lists
of
all
persons
voted
for
as
president
and
of
all
persons
voted
for
as
and
of
the
number
of
votes
for
each
which
lists
they
shall
sign
and
certify
and
transmit
sealed
to
the
seat
of
government
of
the
united
states
directed
to
the
president
of
the
senate
the
president
of
the
senate
shall
in
the
presence
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
open
all
the
certificates
and
the
votes
shall
then
be
counted
the
person
having
the
greatest
number
of
votes
for
president
shall
be
president
if
such
number
be
a
majority
of
the
whole
number
of
electors
appointed
and
if
no
person
have
such
majority
then
from
the
persons
having
the
highest
numbers
not
exceeding
three
on
the
list
of
those
voted
for
as
president
the
house
of
representatives
shall
choose
immediately
by
ballot
the
president
but
in
choosing
the
president
the
votes
shall
be
taken
by
states
the
representation
from
each
state
having
one
vote
a
quorum
for
this
purpose
shall
consist
of
a
member
or
members
from
of
the
states
and
a
majority
of
all
the
states
shall
be
necessary
to
a
choice
and
if
the
house
of
representatives
shall
not
choose
a
president
whenever
the
right
of
choice
shall
devolve
upon
them
before
the
fourth
day
of
march
next
following
then
the
shall
act
as
president
as
in
the
case
of
the
death
or
other
constitutional
disability
of
the
person
having
the
greatest
number
of
votes
as
shall
be
the
if
such
number
be
a
majority
of
the
whole
number
of
electors
appointed
and
if
no
person
have
a
majority
then
from
the
two
highest
numbers
on
the
list
the
senate
shall
choose
the
a
quorum
for
the
purpose
shall
consist
of
of
the
whole
number
of
senators
and
a
majority
of
the
whole
number
shall
be
necessary
to
a
choice
but
no
person
constitutionally
ineligible
to
office
of
president
shall
be
eligible
to
that
of
of
the
united
thus
we
see
that
the
president
may
be
elected
in
one
of
two
ways
by
electors
or
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
that
the
may
also
be
elected
in
one
of
two
ways
by
electors
or
by
the
senate
the
mode
of
choosing
the
president
is
regarded
by
many
as
difficult
to
remember
perhaps
making
an
outline
like
the
following
will
aid
the
memory
mode
or
i
the
electors
after
they
are
chosen

this

was
designed
first
to
prevent

second
to
leave

thought
best
in

shown
if

it
may

in

that

the

in
was
the

day
of
the

and
on
that

the
presidential
terms
have
continued
to
begin
qualifications
of
president
and
no
person
except
a
natural
born
citizen
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
this
constitution
shall
be
eligible

neither
shall
any

be
eligible

office
who
shall
not
have
attained
to
the
age
of
years
and
been
fourteen
years
a
resident
within
the

the
importance
of
the
office
is
such
as
in
the
opinion
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
necessitate
this
requirement
and
it
does
not
seem
unjust
to
make
this
limitation
this
exception
was
made
from
a
sense
of
gratitude
to
many
distinguished
persons
who
though
not
native
citizens
had
placed
their
lives
and
fortunes
at
the
service
of
this
country
during
the
revolution
and
who
had
already
become
citizens
of
the
young
republic
this
provision
is
now
of
course
obsolete
age
should
bring
wisdom
the
age
specified
is
great
enough
to
permit
the
passions
of
youth
to
become
moderated
and
the
judgment
matured
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
youngest
president
yet
elected
was
much
older
than
this
minimum
in
monarchies
the
rulers
are
sometimes
children
it
can
not
be
so
with
us
but
a
natural
born
citizen
even
may
live
so
long
in
a
foreign
country
as
to
lose
his
interest
in
his
native
land
this
provision
is
intended
to
preclude
the
election
of
such
persons
to
the
presidency
they
might
seek
it
at
the
instance
of
a
foreign
government
for
sinister
purposes
will
residence
during
fourteen
years
satisfy
the
requirement
commentators
generally
have
expressed
an
affirmative
opinion
based
upon
the
fact
that
james
buchanan
and
others
were
elected
president
on
their
return
from
diplomatic
service
abroad
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
a
person
sent
abroad
to
represent
this
government
not
lose
his
residence
in
this
therefore
the
fact
of
buchanan
being
elected
after
acting
as
our
minister
to
england
has
no
bearing
upon
the
question
on
the
other
hand
the
evident
purpose
of
the
provision
could
hardly
be
satisfied
if
a
boy
a
native
of
this
country
should
live
here
until
fourteen
years
of
age
and
then
spend
the
rest
of
his
years
in
a
foreign
country
and
when
the
matter
is
carefully
considered
it
will
be
seen
that
the
only
fourteen
years
which
will
secure
that
state
of
mind
in
the
candidate
which
is
sought
by
the
provision
are
the
fourteen
years
preceding
again
and
fourteen
equal
a
person
comes
of
age
at
the
fourteen
years
of
added
would
just
make
years
the
minimum
age
required
this
coincidence
could
hardly
have
been
accidental
and
justifies
the
view
expressed
according
to
the
twelfth
amendment
the
qualifications
of
the
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
president
case
of
the
removal
of
the
president
from
office
or
of
his
death
resignation
or
inability
to
discharge
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
said
office
the
same
shall
devolve
on
the
and
the
congress
may
by
law
provide
for
the
case
of
removal
death
resignation
or
inability
both
of
the
president
and
declaring
what
officer
shall
then
act
as
president
and
such
officer
shall
act
accordingly
until
the
disability
be
removed
or
a
president
shall
be
if
no
regular
succession
were
established
there
would
be
danger
of
anarchy
by
an
act
passed
march
congress
provided
that
in
case
of
the
disability
of
both
president
and
the
duties
of
the
office
of
president
should
devolve
upon
the
president
of
the
senate
and
in
case
of
a
vacancy
in
that
office
that
they
should
then
devolve
upon
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
but
when
president
garfield
died
there
was
no
president
of
the
senate
and
no
speaker
of
the
house
so
that
when
arthur
became
president
there
was
no
one
to
succeed
him
in
case
of
his
disability
it
was
then
expected
that
congress
would
devise
another
plan
of
succession
but
it
did
not
when
hendricks
died
there
was
again
no
president
of
the
senate
or
speaker
of
the
house
this
recurrence
of
the
danger
within
four
years
prompted
congress
to
provide
an
order
of
succession
less
liable
to
accident
than
the
one
so
long
in
use
the
succession
was
placed
in
the
cabinet
in
the
following
order
secretary
of
state
secretary
of
the
treasury
secretary
of
war
secretary
of
the
navy
and
secretary
of
the
interior
when
the
or
secretary
becomes
president
he
serves
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
one
very
important
item
in
this
connection
the
constitution
leaves
unprovided
for
namely
who
shall
determine
when
disability
other
than
death
occurs
or
ceases
certainly
the
decision
should
not
be
left
to
those
interested
in
the
succession
no
official
answer
to
this
question
has
yet
been
given
president
president
shall
at
stated
times
receive
for
his
services
a
compensation
which
shall
be
neither
increased
nor
diminished
during
the
period
for
which
he
shall
have
been
elected
and
he
shall
not
receive
within
that
period
any
other
emolument
from
the
united
states
or
any
of
them
otherwise
a
person
of
moderate
means
would
be
debarred
from
accepting
the
position
and
the
country
might
thereby
be
deprived
of
the
services
of
some
man
of
lofty
character
thus
congress
can
neither
bribe
nor
drive
the
president
into
doing
anything
which
he
may
regard
as
unwise
or
wrong
and
on
the
other
hand
the
president
has
no
temptation
to
try
to
undermine
the
virtue
of
congress
for
his
own
pecuniary
benefit
this
provision
has
the
same
purpose
in
view
as
the
last
he
is
thus
secured
in
a
great
measure
against
all
sinister
foreign
influences
and
he
must
be
lost
to
all
just
sense
of
high
duties
of
his
station
if
he
does
not
conduct
himself
with
an
exclusive
devotion

footnote
story
till
the
salary
of
the
president
was
a
year
it
was
then
raised
to
a
year
he
also
has
the
use
of
the
white
house
which
is
furnished
at
national
expense
and
special
appropriations
are
frequently
made
to
cover
special

have
been
able
to
save
anything
out
of
their
salaries

this

usually
administered
by
the

justice
of

it
is
very
simple
pledging
the

to
two
things
only
but
they
are
the
essential
things
taking
the
oath
is
a
part
of
the
inauguration
ceremonies
which
occur
usually
on
the
fourth
of
march
was
there
any
president
under
the
confederation
why
when

how
does
a

first
proposition
in
the
constitutional
convention
was
to
make
the
presidential
term
seven
years
and
limit
a

is
the

plan
better

a

be

study
it
tear
off
beginning
at

all
that

four
differences
between

which
was

change
what

is
the
result
of

the
duties
of
a

of

with
those
of

that

elected
by
a
direct
vote
of
the

that
the
presidential

should

lengthened
and
a

forbidden
section
powers
of
the
president
some
sole
president
shall
be
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
militia
of
the
several
states
when
called
into
the
actual
service
of
the
united
states
he
may
require
the
opinion
in
writing
of
the
principal
officer
in
each
of
the
executive
departments
upon
any
subject
relating
to
the
duties
of
their
respective
offices
and
he
shall
have
power
to
grant
reprieves
and
pardons
for
offenses
against
the
united
states
except
in
cases
of
impeachment
elsewhere
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
president
to
see
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed
the
execution
of
the
law
may
sometimes
require
force
hence
it
seems
proper
that
the
command
of
the
army
should
be
vested
in
him
again
an
army
may
be
necessary
to
defend
the
country
in
order
that
it
may
act
promptly
and
efficiently
it
must
be
directed
by
one
person
and
the
person
whom
we
instinctively
designate
for
the
purpose
is
the
president
the
possession
of
this
power
by
the
president
is
fraught
with
danger
however
unless
surrounded
by
proper
checks
it
might
be
used
to
overturn
our
system
of
government
but
the
president
can
hardly
as
now
situated
misuse
this
power
in
the
first
place
the
general
rules
for
the
management
and
government
of
the
army
are
made
by
congress
in
the
second
place
the
army
is
supported
by
appropriations
made
by
congress
and
these
are
made
for
short
periods
in
the
third
place
congress
could
reduce
or
even
abolish
the
army
if
that
step
seemed
necessary
in
defense
of
our
liberties
in
brief
the
support
and
control
of
the
army
are
in
the
hands
of
congress
the
president
merely
directs
its
movements
thus
far
the
president
has
never
actually
taken
the
field
in
command
of
the
army
he
has
appointed
military
commanders
and
has
simply
given
them
general
directions
which
they
have
carried
out
as
best
they
could
at
any
time
however
if
dissatisfied
with
the
results
he
may
change
the
commander
the
president
can
not
personally
see
to
the
carrying
out
of
all
the
laws
and
yet
he
is
the
one
responsible
for
their
execution
to
assist
him
the
work
is
divided
up
into
parts
and
each
part
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
an
officer
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
and
responsible
to
him
these
persons
constitute
what
is
known
as
the
cabinet
and
all
but
two
have
the
title
secretary
the
one
who
keeps
the
originals
of
the
public
documents
the
great
seal

called
the
secretary
of

is

somewhat
as
the
clerk

district

county

in
addition
he
is
the

is
the
one

whom
you
would
apply
for

the
officer

adviser
of

by
an
act
approved
february
the
department
of
agriculture
was
established
with
appropriate
duties
assigned
to
it
the
practice
of
holding
regular
cabinet
meetings
was
begun
by
jefferson
and
has
continued
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
expediency
ever
since
the
meetings
are
attended
only
by
the
president
his
private
secretary
and
the
cabinet
they
are
held
for
the
purpose
of
consultation
the
president
may
act
upon
the
advice
of
his
cabinet
or
not
as
he
chooses
the
reports
or
opinions
referred
to
in
the
provision
of
the
constitution
now
under
consideration
are
called
for
at
least
once
a
year
and
are
transmitted
to
congress
with
the
president
message
but
they
may
be
called
for
at
any
time
cabinet
officers
are
not
directly
authorized
by
the
constitution
but
provisions
of
this
section
seem
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
president
would
have
such
assistants
this
power
extends
to
military
offenses
as
well
as
to
the
criminal
offenses
of
civilians
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
the
president
has
power
also
to
commute
sentences
and
that
he
may
act
in
the
matter
at
any
time
after
the
offense
is
committed
even
before
the
trial
he
may
also
stop
proceedings
in
any
criminal
case
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
the
exception
in
case
of
impeachment
was
first
made
in
england
to
prevent
the
king
from
shielding
his
ministers
it
is
in
our
constitution
as
a
similar
check
upon
the
president
powers
shared
by
the
shall
have
power
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
make
treaties
provided
that
of
the
senators
present
concur
and
he
shall
nominate
and
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
shall
appoint
ambassadors
other
public
ministers
and
consuls
judges
of
the
supreme
court
and
all
other
officers
of
the
united
states
whose
appointments
are
not
otherwise
herein
provided
for
and
which
shall
be
established
by
law
but
congress
may
by
law
vest
the
appointment
for
such
inferior
officers
as
they
may
think
proper
in
the
president
alone
in
the
courts
of
law
or
in
the
heads
of
departments
the
advice
of
the
senate
is
rarely
if
ever
asked
but
its
consent
must
be
had
in
order
to
make
the
treaties
lawful
for
the
mode
of
making
treaties
see
pp
the
power
to
make
treaties
was
confided
to
the
president
originally
because
it
had
been
the
custom
for
the
executive
to
possess
the
power
but
it
is
defensible
on
other
grounds
some
treaties
need
to
be
considered
secretly
this
could
hardly
be
done
if
congress
were
the
power
but
the
president
and
the
cabinet
can
consider
the
matter
in
secret
then
promptness
is
sometimes
needed
as
in
case
of
a
treaty
to
close
a
war
promptness
may
prevent
useless
loss
of
life
if
congress
had
to
be
summoned
valuable
time
would
be
taken
as
of
the
senators
present
must
agree
to
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
the
president
can
not
misuse
the
power
granted
in
this
provision
when
the
treaty
necessitates
the
raising
of
money
the
house
of
representatives
is
generally
consulted
also
in
fact
if
the
house
opposed
such
a
treaty
it
is
questionable
whether
it
could
be
carried
out
in
each
of
the
three
great
purchases
of
territory
the
president
consulted
congress
before
making
the
purchase
the
nominations
are
made
in
writing
and
the
senate
may
either
confirm
or
reject
the
nominees
the
person
or
persons
confirmed
are
then
appointed
by
the
president
when
a
nominee
is
rejected
the
president
generally
sends
in
a
new
nomination
this
mode
of
appointment
is
thus
defended
by
alexander
hamilton
in
the
the
blame
of
a
bad
nomination
would
fall
upon
the
president
singly
and
absolutely
the
censure
of
rejecting
a
good
one
would
lie
entirely
at
the
door
of
the
senate
aggravated
by
the
consideration
of
their
having
counteracted
the
good
intentions
of
the
executive
if
an
ill
appointment
should
be
made
the
executive
for
nominating
and
the
senate
for
approving
would
participate
though
in
different
degrees
in
the
opprobrium
and
disgrace
it
will
be
noted
in
this
connection
that
while
in
the
state
most
of
the
officers
are
elected
in
the
general
government
all
officers
except
the
president
and
are
appointed
in
washington
administration
the
question
was
raised
can
the
president
remove
officers
without
the
consent
of
congress
and
it
was
decided
that
the
president
can
remove
all
officers
whom
he
can
appoint
judges
who
hold
for
life
are
of
course
excepted
during
johnson
administration
the
power
of
the
president
in
this
direction
was
declared
to
be
exactly
equal
to
his
power
of
appointment
that
is
if
the
consent
of
the
senate
be
necessary
to
an
appointment
it
would
also
be
necessary
for
removal
but
afterwards
the
law
was
amended
so
that
now
the
president
may
suspend
an
officer
until
the
end
of
the
next
session
of
the
senate
and
make
a
temporary
appointment
if
the
senate
does
not
at
its
next
session
confirm
the
nomination
to
fill
the
vacancy
the
old
officer
is
but
if
the
president
is
determined
to
carry
his
point
he
may
immediately
suspend
the
old
officer
again
and
the
rejected
candidate
and
continue
so
to
do
during
the
early
administrations
comparatively
few
removals
were
made
except
where
it
seemed
necessary
for
the
improvement
of
the
public
service
but
andrew
jackson
introduced
into
our
politics
the
proposition
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
which
means
that
the
party
electing
the
president
should
have
all
the
offices
this
view
of
the
case
presents
to
every
public
officer
the
temptation
to
secure
himself
in
place
not
by
meritorious
service
in
the
line
of
his
duty
but
by
activity
in
the
service
of
his
party
the
tendency
is
to
displace
love
of
country
and
devotion
to
duty
and
to
substitute
therefor
subserviency
to
strong
party
leaders
so
crying
has
the
evil
become
that
many
of
the
wisest
and
most
patriotic
men
in
the
country
are
seeking
to
so
far
reform
the
public
service
that
an
officer
may
feel
reasonably
secure
in
his
position
so
long
as
he
performs
his
duties
faithfully
and
that
vacancies
shall
be
filled
by
the
promotion
of
worthy
subordinates
this
is
to
secure
two
objects
first
to
relieve
the
president
of
the
burden
of
appointing
thousands
of
such
officers
and
second
to
place
the
appointment
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
responsible
for
the
work
of
these
subordinates
the
principal
officers
thus
appointed
are
postmasters
having
salaries
less
than
a
year
appointed
by
the
postmaster
general
clerks
messengers
janitors
in
the
several
departments
appointed
by
the
respective
secretaries
the
chiefs
of
bureaus
and
some
of
the
more
important
officers
in
each
department
are
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
the
subordinates
in
each
custom
house
appointed
by
the
collector
thereof
clerks
of
united
states
courts
appointed
by
the
judges
the
united
states
district
attorneys
and
marshals
are
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
the
term
of
appointees
is
four
years
unless
sooner
removed
they
may
be
and
are
removed
however
as
before
said
not
only
for
unfitness
but
also
for
political
reasons
temporary
president
shall
have
power
to
fill
up
all
vacancies
that
may
happen
during
the
recess
of
the
senate
by
granting
commissions
which
shall
expire
at
the
end
of
their
next
this
provision
is
necessary
because
the
senate
is
not
always
in
session
and
it
would
not
pay
to
convene
it
for
the
purpose
of
acting
upon
nominations
every
time
a
vacancy
occurs
the
president
may
wait
however
if
the
case
will
permit
until
the
next
session
of
congress
before
making
an
appointment
section
duties
of
the
president
shall
from
time
to
time
give
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
he
may
on
extraordinary
occasions
convene
both
houses
or
either
of
them
and
in
case
of
disagreement
between
them
with
respect
to
the
time
of
adjournment
he
may
adjourn
them
to
such
time
as
he
shall
think
proper
he
shall
receive

and
other
public
ministers
he
shall
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
shall
commission
all
officers
of
the
united
states
the
president
complies
with
this
provision
by
sending
to
congress
at
the
beginning
of
each
regular
session
his
annual
message
and
at
other
times
as
occasion
demands
he
sends
special
messages
congress
has
been
convened
in
extra
session
by
presidential
proclamation
only
twelve
times
in
all
the
senate
is
frequently
convened
in
extra
session
at
the
close
of
the
regular
session
to
consider
appointments
this
usually
happens
on
the
accession
of
a
new
president
no
occasion
has
ever
arisen
for
the
exercise
of
this
power
in
all
governments
diplomatic
intercourse
with
other
governments
is
carried
on
through
the
executive
department
see
pages
and
by
receiving
an
ambassador
the
country
from
which
he
comes
is
recognized
as
an
independent
sovereignty
a
nation
ambassadors
may
be
rejected
or
dismissed
if
personally
objectionable
to
this
country
if
the
countries
from
which
they
come
are
not
recognized
as
belonging
to
the
sisterhood
of
nations
or
if
the
relations
between
their
country
and
this
become
unfriendly
nations
at
war
with
each
other
do
not
exchange
ambassadors
each
recalls
its
representative
at
the
time
of
declaring
war
our
ambassadors
or
other
public
ministers
may
be
rejected
by
other
nations
for
the
reasons
given
above
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
this
power
or
duty
may
impose
upon
the
president
at
times
grave
responsibility
the
nature
of
this
responsibility
may
be
understood
when
we
remember
the
efforts
made
by
the
confederate
states
to
secure
recognition
of
their
agents
at
the
courts
of
london
and
paris
during
the
civil
war
for
either
country
to
have
recognized
them
would
have
been
to
interrupt
our
friendly
relations
with
that
country
and
might
have
led
to
war
between
it
and
us
see
page
this
is
the
president
most
important
duty
and
it
is
his
duty
to
enforce
the
law

he
believes
in

wisdom

not

the

here
in

and
it

the
judicial
branch
in
the
two
articles
so
far
considered
we
have
studied
about
the
and
the
branches
of
the
government
we
shall
next
examine
the
third
great
branch
the
one
which
and
the
laws
section
organization
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
be
vested
in
one
supreme
court
and
in
such
inferior
courts
as
the
congress
may
from
time
to
time
ordain
and
establish
the
judges
both
of
the
supreme
and
inferior
courts
shall
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior
and
shall
at
stated
times
receive
for
their
services
a
compensation
which
shall
not
be
diminished
during
their
continuance
in
office
the
creation
of
the
supreme
court
a
distinct
coordinate
branch
for
the
final
interpretation
of
law
was
the
of
the
constitution
the
supreme
court
has
no
prototype
in
history
while
the
of
the
supreme
court
is
thus
provided
for
in
the
constitution
the
of
to
constitute
it
was
wisely
left
with
congress
thus
the
organization
may
be
changed
as
circumstances
change
the
supreme
court
at
first
consisted
of
six
justices
as
they
are
called
but
owing
to
the
growth
of
the
country
and
the
consequent
increase
of
labor
to
be
performed
the
number
of
justices
has
been
increased
to
nine
under
this
provision
congress
has
established
three
grades
of
inferior
united
states
courts
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
circuit
courts
and
the
district
courts
the
united
states
is
divided
into
nine
judicial
to
each
of
which
are
assigned
one
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
two
circuit
judges
see
page
these
constitute
what
is
called
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
having
appellate
jurisdiction
in
their
respective
circuits
and
holding
annual
sessions
for
that
purpose
see
page
the
united
states
is
further
subdivided
into
more
than
sixty
judicial
in
each
of
these
districts
at
least
one
session
of
the
circuit
court
and
one
of
the
district
court
is
held
each
year
see
pages
and
a
full
circuit
court
bench
consists
of
a
supreme
court
justice
a
circuit
judge
and
a
district
judge
but
court
may
be
held
by
any
one
or
two
of
them
the
district
court
consists
of
the
district
judge
this
virtually
means
during
life
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
raise
the
judges
above
temptation
to
put
them
in
a
position
where
they
may
feel
safe
in
doing
their
exact
duty
unawed
by
any
outside
power
if
with
this
opportunity
they
prove
unjust
they
may
be
impeached
but
so
far
almost
without
exception
those
who
have
been
honored
with
a
place
on
a
united
states
court
have
proved
worthy
of
their
high
calling
the
purpose
of
this
also
is
to
remove
temptation
from
the
judges
the
salary
of
the
chief
justice
is
a
year
and
that
of
each
associate
justice
this
seems
like
a
generous
amount
but
several
times
a
place
on
the
supreme
bench
has
been
declined
on
the
plea
that
the
nominee
could
not
afford
to
serve
for
the
salary
attached
this
is
to
prevent
the
other
two
branches
from
occupying
a
threatening
attitude
toward
the
judiciary
but
the
salary
may
be
increased
and
the
salary
may
be
reduced
to
take
effect
with
appointments
made
after
the
passage
of
the
law
section
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
all
cases
in
law
and
equity
arising
under
this
constitution
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
treaties
made
or
which
shall
be
made
under
their
authority
to
all
cases
affecting
ambassadors
other
public
ministers
and
consuls
to
all
cases
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party
to
controversies
between
two
or
more
states
between
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state
between
citizens
of
different
states
between
citizens
of
the
same
state
claiming
lands
under
grants
of
different
states
and
between
a
state
or
the
citizens
thereof
and
foreign
states
citizens
or
subjects
the
courts
decide
what
the
law
is
whether
a
specified
law
is
constitutional
or
not
and
what
the
meaning
of
constitutional
provisions
is
but
only
as
these
questions
arise
in
brought
before
them
for
trial
they
do
not
advise
congress
or
the
president
as
to
the
constitutionality
or
unconstitutionally
of
a
law
they
do
not
directly
make
law
but
in
determining
the
meaning
of
certain
laws
and
of
constitutional
provisions
they
may
determine
what
the
law
is
and
thus
they
may
be
said
to
make
law
indirectly
but
sometimes
a
legal
question
or
a
question
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
constitutional
provision
remains
for
a
long
time
unanswered
because
no
involving
the
question
comes
before
the
courts
sometimes
the
law
provides
no
adequate
remedy
for
a
wrong
here
is
the
necessity
for
a
court
of
equity
for
instance
a
sells
his
business
to
b
agreeing
not
to
become
a
rival
but
immediately
reopens
in
the
next
block
b
only
remedy
in
law
is
to
secure
damages
if
this
remedy
is
shown
to
be
inadequate
a
court
of
equity
will
close
a
store
or
if
c
having
contracted
to
do
a
certain
act
for
d
fails
or
declines
to
perform
his
part
the
law
can
only
award
d
damages
equity
will
compel
the
fulfillment
of
the
contract
law
is
curative
equity
is
preventive
see
dole
in
some
states
there
are
separate
courts
of
law
and
of
equity
but
the
provision
under
discussion
gives
the
united
states
courts
jurisdiction
in
cases
both
of
law
and
of
equity
there
are
no
juries
in
equity
cases
and
no
criminal
trials
these
pertain
to
the
whole
united
states
so
cases
arising
under
them
should
be
tried
by
a
national
not
by
a
state
court
thus
showing
respect
for
the
governments
represented
by
them
that
is
to
cases
arising
on
the
high
seas
or
on
navigable
waters
these
matters
according
also
to
i
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
this
provision
is
simply
a
consequence
of
the
two
referred
to
because
then
the
interests
of
the
whole
country
are
at
stake
and
should
not
be
left
to
any
state
because
the
united
states
was
organized
to
insure
domestic
tranquility
this
provision
has
been
modified
by
the
eleventh
amendment
which
reads
as
follows
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
to
any
suit
in
law
or
equity
commenced
or
prosecuted
against
one
of
the
united
states
by
citizens
of
another
state
or
by
citizens
or
subjects
of
any
foreign
state
that
is
if
the
state
is
the
the
suit
may
be
tried
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
compare
clause
claims
of
individuals
against
a
state
if
denied
by
the
auditor
may
be
referred
by
them
to
the
legislature
a
state
can
not
be
sued
by
an
individual
or
corporation
when
a
citizen
is
sued
he
must
be
sued
either
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
or
in
those
of
his
own
state
it
would
be
a
source
of
irritation
to
compel
a
state
to
sue
a
citizen
of
another
state
in
the
courts
of
his
own
state
hence
this
provision
that
such
suits
shall
be
in
the
united
states
court
to
remove
temptation
to
injustice
through
local
prejudice
but
the
suit
is
tried
in
and
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
of
which
the
defendant
is
a
citizen
because
the
states
are
involved
in
the
suit
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
let
either
decide
the
controversy
this
provision
is
not
of
much
importance
now
because
state
boundaries
are
clearly
defined
but
when
the
constitution
was
framed
this
kind
of
question
meant
a
good
deal
the
charters
given
during
colonial
times
were
very
loosely
drawn
and
claims
of
different
colonies
and
proprietors
overlapped
each
other
the
question
of
ownership
had
not
been
settled
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
during
the
formative
or
confederation
period
these
disputes
had
been
a
source
of
much
because
the
general
government
and
not
the
individual
states
has
charge
of
our
foreign
relations
a
foreign
country
holds
the
united
states
responsible
for
the
acts
of
its
citizens
and
only
the
united
states
can
be
looked
to
to
secure
justice

its
citizens
on
the
part
of
foreign
countries

such
trial
shall
be
held
in
the
state
where
said
crimes
shall
have
been
committed
but
when
not
committed
within
any
state
the
trial
shall
be
at
such
place
or
places
as
congress
may
by
law
have
directed
a
trial
by
jury
is
a
trial
by
twelve
men
impartially
selected
this
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
great
bulwarks
of
liberty
civil
cases
may
at
the
desire
of
both
parties
be
tried
by
the
court
only
but
for
criminal
trials
a
jury
is
guaranteed
by
this
provision
in
a
criminal
trial
the
state
or
the
nation
is
the
prosecutor
and
state
or
national
judges
be
tempted
to
decide
unjustly
if
the
matter
were
left
to
them
this
leaves
the
accused
in
better
condition
to
defend
himself
than
if
he
could
be
taken
away
far
from
home
he
is
thus
able
at
the
least
expense
to
bring
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf
in
harmony
with
this
each
state
has
at
least
one
district
court
for
the
trial
of
crimes
against
the
general
government
see
declaration
of
independence
this
provision
is
probably
binding
also
upon
the
states
that
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
one
of
the
territories
in
the
indian
country
in
the
forts
or
arsenals
of
the
united
states
or
upon
the
high
seas
congress
has
specified
courts
for
the
trial
of
such
crimes
those
committed
on
the
high
seas
are
tried
in
the
state
where
the
vessel
arrives
see

section
treason
definition
and
against
the
united
states
shall
consist
only
in
levying
war
against
them
or
in
adhering
to
their
enemies
giving
them
aid
and
comfort
no
person
shall
be
convicted
of
treason
unless
on
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
to
the
same
overt
act
or
on
confession
in
open
court
treason
is
in
essence
a
deliberate
and
violent
breach
of
the
allegiance
due
from
a
citizen
or
subject
to
his
government
being
directed
against
the
powers
that
be
the
government
in
self
defense
is
tempted
to
punish
it
severely
the
more
tyrannical
a
government
is
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
plotted
against
and
the
more
suspicious
it
becomes
if
treason
were
undefined
the
government
might
declare
acts
to
be
treasonable
which
the
people
never
suspected
to
be
so
this
had
occurred
so
many
times
and
good
men
had
so
often
been
sent
on
this
charge
to
an
ignominious
death
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
deemed
it
prudent
to
define
treason
carefully
in
the
fundamental
law
itself
these
provisions
are
taken
from
the
famous
statute
of
edward
iii
which
first
defined
treason
in
england
this
statute
declared
five
things
to
be
treasonable
only
the
third
and
fourth
of
which
are
held
by
our
constitution
to
be
so
an
overt
act
is
an
open
act
not
one
that
is
simply
meditated
or
talked
about
but
one
actually
performed
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
there
must
be
an
actual
levying
of
war
that
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
is
not
treason
but
if
hostilities
have
actually
begun
if
war
has
commenced
all
those
who
perform
any
part
however
minute
or
however
remote
from
the
scene
of
action
and
who
are
leagued
in
the
general
conspiracy
are
to
be
considered
traitors
two
witnesses
at
least
to
the
overt
act
are
required
because
thus
only
can
a
preponderance
of
testimony
be
secured
congress
shall
have
power
to
declare
the
punishment
of
treason
but
no
attainder
of
treason
shall
work
corruption
of
blood
or
forfeiture
except
during
the
life
of
the
person
as
has
been
hinted
the
punishment
of
treason
had
been
very
severe
in
european
countries
not
only
was
the
person
convicted
of
treason
put
to
death
in
the
most
horrible
ways
but
his
property
was
forfeited
and
no
one
could
inherit
property
from
him
or
through
him
thus
not
only
the
person
himself
but
also
his
children
and
his
children
children
were
punished
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
in
the
words
of
madison
to
restrain
congress
from
extending
the
consequences
of
guilt
beyond
the

of

the
necessity
for
this
provision
will
readily
be
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
each
state
has
jurisdiction
only
within
its
own
limits
but
for
this
provision
criminals
would
be
comparatively
free
from
restraint
because
they
could
in
most
cases
get
into
another
state
and
this
would
of
course
tend
to
increase

this
clause
was
inserted
as
a
concession
to
the
states
and
had
special
reference
to
slaves
though
it
also
applied
to
apprentices
and
any
other
persons
who
for
any
reason
might
be
bound
to
service
but
as
slavery
no
longer
exists
and
apprenticeship
and
other
binding
to
service
are
almost
things
of
the
past
this
provision
is
practically
obsolete
section

states
or
parts
of
states
without
the
consent
of
the
legislatures
of
the
states
concerned
as
well
as
of
the
congress
these
few
words
mark
an
era
in
political
history
heretofore
nations
had
acquired
new
territory
merely
to
enlarge
the
extent
of
their
or
subject
states
never
with
a
view
of
uniting
the
acquired
territory
with
the
original
system
allowing
it
equal
political
privileges
but
when
we
look
at
the
matter
carefully
we
shall
see
that
our
government
could
not
consistently
do
otherwise
than
it
did
the
proposition
involved
in
the
revolution
was
that
new
territory
should
either
be
permitted
to
enjoy
equal
privileges
with
the
parent
state
or
it
should
become
independent
but
it
was
not
simply
to
carry
out
a
political
theory
that
this
provision
was
made
it
was
to
solve
a
practical
difficulty
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
united
states
extended
west
to
the
mississippi
river
the
territory
west
of
the
alleghany
mountains
contained
almost
no
inhabitants
and
was
of
course
unorganized
this
territory
became
the
object
of
contention
some
of
the
states
claimed
jurisdiction
over
it
while
others
maintained
that
it
was
not
within
the
limits
of
any
states
and
that
as
it
had
been
secured
by
a
war
waged
by
the
general
government
this
territory
should
be
considered
common
property
to
be
managed
by
the
general
government
the
states
having
claims
upon
the
territory
expressed
a
willingness
to
relinquish
them
upon
the
condition
that
the
territory
should
be
formed
into
states
as
soon
as
the
population
would
warrant
accordingly
before
the
constitution
was
framed
all
these
states
except
north
carolina
and
georgia
had
relinquished
their
claims
and
all
but
a
small
portion
of
the
territory
was
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
government
and
july
that
portion
of
the
country
west
of
pennsylvania
and
north
of
the
ohio
had
been
organized
into
the
northwest
territory
this
act
of
congress
is
generally
known
as
the
ordinance
of
it
was
for
a
long
time
the
model
upon
which
other
territories
were
organized
this
shows
the
fear
entertained
lest
the
general
government
should
try
to
control
a
state
by
threatening
its
existence
vermont
was
claimed
by
both
new
york
and

consented

admission

to
dispose
of

make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
or
other
property
belonging
to

and
nothing
in
this
constitution
shall
be
so
construed
as
to
prejudice
any
claims
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
particular
state
the
power
to
territory
is
not
expressly
granted
in
the
constitution
but
it
is
implied
as
an
act
of
sovereignty
territory
was
acquired
by
the
general
government
before
the
constitution
by
cession
from
states
and
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
it
has
been
acquired
by
purchase
by
discovery
by
conquest
and
by
annexation
the
power
to
of
territory
is
also
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
and
would
have
belonged
to
the
general
government
without
this
provision
but
this
provision
places
the
power
in
the
hands
of
otherwise
land
could
be
sold
by
the
power
under
this
provision
congress
receded
to
virginia
that
portion
of
the
district
of
columbia
south
of
the
potomac
the
power
to
govern
any
territory
which
it
possesses
is
also
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
this
clause
gives
the
power
to
congress
but
any
law
for
the
regulation
of
territories
needs
the
president
signature
the
same
as
any
other
law
it
will
be
remembered
that
north
carolina
and
georgia
had
not
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
relinquished
their
claims
to
certain
territory
lying
outside
of
their
state
limits
this
provision
was
made
as
a
concession
to
them
but
they
afterwards
north
carolina
in
and
georgia
in
ceded
the
disputed
territory
to
the

to

of

against
one
man
or
a
few
men
who
may
try
to
usurp
the
functions
of
the
state
government
by
inference
the
united
states
could
insist
upon
a
republican
form
of
government
even
if
the
people
of
the
state
desired
some
other
happily
no
necessity
for
the
exercise
of
this
power
has
yet
arisen
this
would
have
been
the
duty
of
the
general
government
even
if
this
provision
had
not
been
made
to
defend
the
country
against
invasion
is
one
of
the
principal
duties
of
government
the
government
was
organized
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
to
insure
domestic
tranquillity
was
another
reason
given
for
the
establishment
of
the
constitution
but
lest
the
general
government
should
make
every
little
disturbance
a
pretext
for
interfering
with
the
local
affairs
of
a
state
it
was
provided
that
no
interference
should
occur
until
asked
for
by

secured

therefore
they

this
provision
settles
definitely
and
in
what
would
seem
to
be
unmistakable
terms
the
question
of
supremacy
about
which
so
much
discussion
has
been
carried
on
within
its
sphere
within
the
limitations
placed
upon
it
by

an
act

the

of
the

by

adoption
of
this
constitution

church
of

this
constitution
set
the
example
of
abolishing
religious
tests
for
public
office
and
the
wisdom
of
this
is
so
apparent
that
it
has
been
followed
entirely
or
in
part
by
many
of
the
civilized
nations

chapter
xxix
the
amendments
we
have
now
considered
the
constitution
about
as
it
was
presented
to
the
states
for
ratification
judging
by
our
own
affection
for
the
noble
instrument
we
would
expect
to
learn
that
it
was
ratified
promptly
and
unanimously
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
much
hard
work
was
required
on
the
part
of
its
friends
to
secure
its
ratification
its
every
provision
had
to
be
explained
and
justified
probably
the
most
able
exposition
was
made
by
hamilton
madison
and
jay
in
a
series
of
papers
entitled
the
federalist
one
of
the
greatest
objections
urged
against
the
constitution
was
that
it
did
not
guarantee
sufficiently
the
rights
of
individuals
it
will
be
remembered
in
this
connection
that
the
principal
grievance
against
england
as
expressed
in
the
declaration
of
independence
was
that
personal
rights
had
not
been
respected
and
that
in
consequence
the
first
form
of
government
organized
after
independence
the
articles
of
confederation
gave
the
general
government
no
power
to
reach
individuals
experience
showed
this
to
have
been
a
mistake
and
the
constitution
authorizes
the
general
government
to
execute
its
laws
directly
enabling
it
to
hold
individuals
responsible
on
account
of
this
of
power
many
people
honestly
feared
that
the
new
government
might
trespass
upon
personal
rights
as
england
had
done
and
several
states
at
the
time
of
ratifying
suggested
the
propriety
of
so
amending
the
constitution
as
to
remove
these
fears
in
accordance
with
these
recommendations
amendments
were
proposed
at
the
first
session
of
congress
the
house
of
representatives
proposed
seventeen
to
twelve
of
which
the
senate
agreed
only
ten
however
were
ratified
by
the
legislatures
of
of
the
states
they
are
of
course
the
first
ten
among
those
that
follow
it
was
decided
by
the
same
congress
that
the
amendments
should
not
be
incorporated
into
the
main
body
of
the
constitution
but
should
be
appended
to
it
as
distinct
articles
they
have
however
the
same
force
as
the
original
constitution
article
i
freedom
of
religion
of
speech
and
of
assembly
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
or
grievances
the
chief
purpose
for
which
many
of
the
early
settlers
came
to
america
was
that
they
might
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
conscience
hence
their
descendants
put
among
the
individual
rights
to
be
protected
this
freedom
of
religion
but
this
provision
does
not
authorize
any
one
to
commit
crime
in
the
name
of
religion
the
only
limitation
upon
speech
in
this
country
is
that
the
rights
of
others
be
respected
any
one
may
think
as
he
pleases
upon
any
subject
and
may
freely
express
his
opinion
provided
that
in
doing
so
he
does
not
trespass
upon
the
rights
of
others
it
would
seem
that
under
a
republican
form
of
government
this
right
might
be
assumed
to
be
secure
the
provision
is
meant
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
history
had
shown
the
necessity
of
such
precaution
article
ii
right
to
bear
arms
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
it
should
not
be
the
policy
of
a
republic
to
keep
a
large
standing
army
an
army
is
expensive
it
takes
so
many
men
from
productive
industries
and
it
is
dangerous
to
liberty
it
may
from
its
training
become
the
instrument
of
tyranny
but
a
republic
must
have
defenders
against
foes
foreign
or
domestic
a
militia
may
be
depended
upon
to
fight
with
valor
against
a
foreign
foe

may
at
the
same
time
serve
as
a
check
upon
usurpation

the
grievances

colonies

of

had
been
and
indeed
is
in

countries
to
this
day
a
mode
of

to
be

liberty

in

this
security
is
never
more
attacked
than
in
public
and
private
accusations
it
is
therefore
upon
the
excellence
of
the
criminal

that
chiefly
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
depends
and
lieber
in
his
very
able
work
on
civil
liberty
and
says
a
sound
penal
trial
is
invariably
one
of
the
last
fruits
of
political
civilization
partly
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
subjects
to
elaborate
and
because
it
requires
long
experience
to
find
the
proper
mean
between
a
due
protection
of
the
indicted
person
and
an
equally
due
protection
of
society
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
in
all
spheres
of
action
to
induce
irritated
power
to
limit
itself
besides
the
guarantees
of
the
constitution
lieber
mentions
the
following
as
characteristic
of
a
sound
penal
trial
the
person
to
be
tried
must
be
present
and
of
course
living
every
man
must
be
held
innocent
until
proved
otherwise
the
indictment
must
be
definite
and
the
prisoner
must
be
allowed
reasonable
time
to
prepare
his
defense
the
trial
must
be
oral
there
must
be
law
of
evidence
which
must
exclude
hearsay
evidence
the
judge
must
refrain
from
witnesses
the
verdict
must
be
upon
the
evidence
alone
and
it
must
be
or
guilty
footnote
in
some
countries
the
verdict
may
leave
a
stigma
upon
an
accused
person
against
whom
guilt
can
not
be
proven
of
this
nature
was
the
old
verdict
the
punishment
must
be
in
proportion
to
the
offense
and
in
accordance
with
common
sense
and
justice
and
there
must
be
no
injudicious
pardoning
power
which
is
a
direct
interference
with
the
true
government
of
law
most
if
not
all
but
the
last
of
the
points
mentioned
by
lieber
are
covered
by
that
rich
inheritance
which
we
have
from
england
that
unwritten
constitution

common

the
question
of
how
best
to
regulate
the
pardoning
power
is
still
unsettled
he
may
have
his
trial
at
the
next
term
of

which
is
never
very
remote
but
the
accused
may
at
his
own
request
have
his
trial
postponed
publicity

secured
by
the
keeping
of
official
records
to
which
all
may
have
access

of

to

see

it
is
provided
in
the
body
of
the
constitution
that
criminal
trial
shall
be
by
jury
and
in
the
state
where
the
crime
was
committed
this
amendment
makes
the
further
limitation
that
the
trial
shall
be
in
the
where
the
crime
was
committed
so
a
person
accused
of
crime
can
not
be
put
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
transporting
witnesses
a
great
distance
the
nature
of
the
accusation
is
specified
in
the
and
in
the
indictment
both
of
which
or
certified
copies
of
them
the
accused
has
a
right
to
see
not
only
do
the
witnesses
give
their
evidence
in
the
presence
of
the
accused
but
he
has
also
the
right
to
them
but
for
this
compulsory
process
a
persons
entirely
guiltless
might
be
unable
to
produce
evidence
in
their
own
behalf
the
natural
desire
of
people
to
keep
out
of
trouble
would
keep
some
knowing
the
circumstances
of
the
case
from
giving
their
testimony
and
others
would
be
afraid
to
speak
up
for
one
under
a
cloud
and
with
all
the
power
of
the
government
arrayed
against
him
the
accused
may
plead
his
own
cause
or
he
may
engage
a
lawyer
to
do
it
for
him
if
he
is
too
poor
to
employ
counsel
the
judge
appoints
a
lawyer
to
defend
him
whose
services
are
paid
for
out
of
the
public
treasury
from
the
foregoing
it
will
be
seen
that
great
care
is
exercised
to
give
a
person
accused
of
crime
full
opportunity
to
defend
himself
and
it
must
be
remembered
in
this
connection
that
it
is
a
principle
of
our
jurisprudence
that
burden
of
proof
lies
upon
the
that
is
the
accused
is
to
be
deemed
innocent
until
he
is
guilty
we
prefer
that
a
number
of
guilty
persons
should
escape
punishment
rather
than
that
one
innocent
person
should
suffer

be
borne
in

that
those
who

had
been
abused
in

that

aid
or
comfort

enemies
thereof
but
congress
may
by
a
vote
of
each
house
remove
such

the
primary
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
exclude
from
public
office
those
who
in
the
civil
war
by
entering
the
service
of
the
confederate
states
broke
an
oath
previously
taken

the
persons
whom
it
was
immediately
intended
to
affect
will
soon
all
be
with
the
silent
majority
the
provision
by
being
made
part
of
the
constitution
will
remain
a
warning
to
all
in
the
future
the
disabilities
have
been
removed
from
all
but
a
few
of
those
immediately
referred
to
this
clause
seems
to
put
another
limitation

the

the

had
been
specially
authorized
by
congress
to
grant
amnesty
to
political
offenders
and
in

johnson
continued
to
grant
such
amnesty
denying
the
power
of
congress
to
put
any
limitation
upon
the
president
pardoning
power
but
this
provision
specifically
places
the
power
to
relieve
certain
disabilities
in
the
hands
of

the

is
required
in

divided

into

classes
based
upon
the
number
of
persons
constituting
the
governing
element
as
follows
government
by

by

by

democracy
subdivisions
of
these
classes
may
be
made
as

by
monarchy
hereditary
or
elective
absolute
or
limited
by
the
oligarchy
or
aristocracy
by
the
democracy
or
republic
definitions
and
a
hereditary
monarchy
is
one
in
which
the
succession
is
acquired
by
birth
the
usual
order
being
from
father
to
eldest
son
examples
england
prussia
etc
an
elective
monarchy
is
one
in
which
the
succession
is
by
election
the
term
for
life
example
the
old
german
empire
in
which
the
emperor
was
chosen
by
certain
princes
called
electors
footnote
our
mode
of
electing
a
president
may
have
been
suggested
in
part
by
this
old
practice
an
absolute
monarchy
is
one
in
which
the
three
functions
of
government
as
related
to
law
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
are
all
vested
in
one
person
examples
russia
and
turkey
in
europe
and
most
of
the
countries
of
asia
and
africa
a
limited
monarchy
is
one
in
which
the
sovereign
power
is
confined
chiefly
to
executing
the
laws
framed
and
interpreted
by
other
departments
examples
england
and
most
of
the
other
countries
of
europe
an
oligarchy
is
that
form
of
government
in
which
the
supreme
power
is
vested
in
the
hands
of
a
few
few
example
the
triumvirates
of
rome
an
aristocracy
is
really
a
government
by
the
best
the
select
the
best
this
is
the
sense
in
which
the
word
was
first
used
it
has
come
to
mean
government
by
a
privileged
class
aristocracy
seldom
if
ever
exists
alone
a
democracy
is
that
form
of
government
in
which
the
functions
are
administered
directly
by
the
people
only
the
clerical
or
ministerial
work
being
done
by
officers
and
they
appointed
by
the
people
examples
the
old
german
tribes
some
of
the
states
of
ancient
greece
some
of
the
present
cantons
of
switzerland
the
early
settlements
of
new
england
and
in
a
limited
sense
our
own
school
districts
and
towns
a
republic
is
a
representative
democracy
a
democracy
is
practicable
only
within
a
very
limited
area
when
the
area
grows
large
the
people
must
delegate
much
of
work
of
government
to
representatives
examples
the
united
states
each
state
in
the
union
switzerland
and
most
of
the
countries
of
america
the
origin
of
each
typical
monarchy
and
oligarchy
both
probably
owe
their
existence
to
war
the
successful
chieftain
or
leader
in
war
became
the
king
and
his
retainers
or
followers
became
the
privileged
classes
those
who
were
subdued
either
became
slaves
or
were
simply
the
common
people
democracy
had
its
beginnings
and
flourishes
best
in
times
of
peace
the
people
though
they
had
to
fight
again
and
again
to
secure
recognition
have
really
won
their
right
to
it
by
the
arts
of
peace
the
criteria
of
good
among
the
tests
by
which
the
goodness
or
badness
of
a
government
or
form
of
government
may
be
determined
are
the
following
a
good
government
is
stability
is
the
foundation
of
worthiness
of
character
in
governments
as
well
as
in

the
basis
of
progress
is

one
can
not
grow
wise
or
rich
or
strong
unless
he
can
preserve
at
least
a
part
of
what
he
gains
conduciveness
to

a

anything
to

gives
a
mental

moral
training
otherwise
unattainable

the

mental
development

says
still

salutary
is
the
moral
part
of
the
instruction
afforded
by
the
participation
of
the
private
citizen

even

his

at

principles

maxims
which

for
their
reason

usually

him

work

more
familiarized
than
his

chapter
xxxi
contracts
a
contract
is
an
agreement
between
two
or
more
parties
containing

the
one
hand
an

on
the
other
an
contracts
are

is
one
whose
terms
are

stated
in

an

is
one
whose
terms
are
understood
from
the
circumstances
a
written
contract
is
express
an
oral
contract
may
be
express
or
implied
fundamental
every
one
able
to
contract
is
free
to
enter
into
any
agreement
not
forbidden
by
law
every
such
person
is
bound
to
fulfill
every
legal
contract
that
he
makes
essential
to
a
to
be
binding
however
a
contract
must
be
to
do
a
lawful
most
contracts
are
permitted
by
law
but
a
contract
the
carrying
out
of
which
is
recognized
as
subversive
of
justice
morality
or
the
general
welfare
is
illegal
and
therefore
void
the
thing
contracted
to
be
done
must
be
possible
in
its
that
a
person
finds
it
impossible
the
to
live
up
to
his
contract
should
not
and
does
not
release
him
from
responsibility
the
parties
to
the
agreement
must
be
competent
to
persons
not
able
to
contract
are
minors
lunatics
idiots
and
drunk
people
and
married
women
except
in
some
states
in
relation
to
their
separate
estates
the
purpose
of
this
arrangement
is
to
protect
those
who
can
not
protect
themselves
a
minor
may
however
enforce
a
contract
if
he
chooses
to
do
so
a
contract
with
a
minor
for
the
necessaries
of
life
when
they
are
not
or
can
not
be
furnished
by
a
parent
or
guardian
is
valid
and
any
contract
ratified
by
a
minor
after
coming
of
age
is
binding
upon
him
a
person
unable
to
contract
personally
can
not
contract
through
an
agent
but
he
may
act
as
an
agent
the
parties
to
the
contract
must
assent
to
the
assent
must
be
voluntary
it
may
be
given
by
words
by
acts
or
by
accepting
the
benefits
of
the
offer
if
acceptance
is
by
letter
the
contract
is
complete
when
the
letter
of
acceptance
is
mailed
the
parties
must
assent
to
the
same
thing
assent
imposing
a
new
condition
is
no
assent
the
promise
must
be
for
a
the
law
will
not
compel
a
person
to
give
something
for
nothing
but
the
amount
of
the
consideration
is
usually
unimportant
so
long
as
it
is
reasonable
anything
is
a
consideration
which
is
of
benefit
to
the
person
promising
or
of
loss
or
inconvenience
to
the
other
an
illegal
consideration
is
however
not
a
consideration
nor
is
the
performance
of
a
moral
duty
nor
the
doing
of
what
would
be
a
legal
duty
without
the
promise
in
question
if
the
consideration
fails
the
contract
fails
one
has
no
right
to
sue
on
a
contract
unless
he
has
performed
or
offered
to
perform
his
part
the
contract
must
be
made
without
fraud
may
be
practiced
in
two
ways
by
making
statements
known
to
be
false
or
by
concealing
facts
that
ought
to
be
revealed
but
if
the
parties
meet
on
equal
terms
with
the
same
sources
of
information
and
if
nothing
is

what
it
partnership
is
the
relation
existing
between
persons
who
have
agreed
to
combine
their
property
or
skill
for
the
prosecution
of
a
given
enterprise
and
to
share
the
profits
or
losses
resulting
therefrom
how
partnership
being
a
matter
of
agreement
is
subject
to
the
law
of
contracts
when
the
agreement
is
in
writing
it
is
called
articles
of
copartnership
the
articles
usually
specify
the
parties
and
the
firm
name
the
nature
and
the
location
of
the
business
to
be
carried
on
the
investment
of
each
party
the
basis
for
apportioning
profits
and
losses
and
sometimes
the
duration
of
the
there
are
generally
other
provisions

nature
depending
upon
the
circumstances
as
to
each
other
the
partners
have
the
rights
and
duties
which
they
agree
upon
as
to
third
parties
the
two
most
important
rules
of
law
are
first
that
firm
is
bound
by
the
acts
of
each
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
firm
business
second
member
is
liable
for
all
the
debts
of
the
if
the
duration
of
the
partnership
is
not
specified
it
may
be
dissolved
by
any
partner
at
any
time
if
its
duration
is
specified
it
expires
of
course
by
limitation
or
by
mutual
consent
in
either
case
the
death
of
a
partner
dissolves
the
firm
if
a
partner
becomes
insane
or
acts
fraudulently
the
partnership
may
be
dissolved
by
a
decree
of
the
court
the
sale
of
an
interest
which
must
have
the
consent
of
each
partner

the
partnership

forms
a
new
one

of
that
the
retiring
partners
may
be
freed
from
responsibility
for
new
debts
if
the
dissolution
be
by
sale
of
interest
and
this
is
a
very
common
way
notice
of
the
dissolution
must
be
given
to
the
world
and
special
notice
of
the
fact
must
be
given
to
those
from
whom
the
firm
has
been
in
the
habit
of
buying
limited
in
most
states
what
is
called
a
limited
partnership
may
be
formed
whereby
the
responsibility
of
some
of
the
partners
may
be
limited
to
their
investment
in
the
business
by
this
arrangement
the
private
property
of
the
special
partners
as
they
are
called
can
not
be
taken
for
debts
of
the
firm
in
such
a
case
however
it
is
but
just
and
the
law
therefore
demands
that
notice
of
the
fact
of
limited
responsibility
be
given
and
that
no
appearance
of
responsibility
be
assumed
to
this
end
it
is
required
a
that
the
articles
of
copartnership
be
in
writing
and
that
they
be
published
and
recorded
b
that
the
amount
contributed
by
the
special
partners
be
actually
paid
in
c
that
the
names
of
the
special
partners
do
not
appear
in
the
firm
name
d
that
they
take
no
active
part

corporations
purpose
partnership
enables
a
number
of
persons
as
we
have
seen
to
accomplish
by
combining
their
property
and
skill
what
would
be
unattainable
by
them
acting
individually
but
the
individual
responsibility
involved
in
partnership
and
the
difficulty
of
transferring
interest
render
necessary
some
other
mode
of
combining
capital
for
carrying
on
enterprises
requiring
vast
resources
and
from
their
nature
demanding
long
time
and
freedom
from
interruption
for
their
accomplishment
for
instance
no
one
would
dare
to
assume
personal
responsibility
for
the
debts
of
a
railroad
nor
could
such
an
enterprise
be
managed
if
every
transfer
of
interest
dissolved
the
company
the
desired
limitation
of
responsibility
and
facility
of
transfer
of
interest
are
secured
by
the
formation
of
but
responsibility
there
must
be
or
the
combination
could
transact
no
business
and
responsibility
depends
upon
personality
a
can
not
be
held
responsible
as
this
personality
does
not
exist
aside
from
the
persons
of
those
uniting
their
resources
it
must
be
created
the
creative
power
is
the
legislature
the
personality
created
is
the
corporation
footnote
from
the
latin
corporis
a
body
a
corporation
is
therefore
an
artificial
or
fictitious
person
created
under
general
law
or
by
a
special
act
of
the
legislature
footnote
this
special
act
defining
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
corporation
is
called
its
and
capable
of
acting
within
prescribed
limits
as
if
it
were
a
natural
person
but
beyond
those
limits
incapable
of
acting
at
all
the
persons
who
contribute
to
the
capital

the
corporation

company
receive
certificates
of
stock

is
pieces
of
paper
certifying
that
said
persons
own
so
many
shares
in
the
company
the
capital
be
it
remembered
is
the
property
of
the
corporation
not
of
the
individuals
the
number
of
these
stockholders
may
be
large
or
small
a
dozen
or
a
thousand
the
general
management
of
corporate
business
is
necessarily
entrusted
to
a
small
number
of
persons
called
directors
these
are
elected
by
the
stockholders
each
share
having
one
vote
the
directors
select
from
their
own
number
a
president
a
secretary
and
other
necessary
officers
these
persons
and
the
other
agents
of
the
corporation
carry
out
the
policy
determined
upon
by
the
directors
why
limited
in
the
question
suggests
itself
why
can
a
corporation
do
only
certain
things
the
most
obvious
answer
is
that
this
is
consequent
upon
its
mode
of
creation
being
a
creature
of
the
legislature
it
can
have
only
those
powers
which
are
specifically
or
impliedly
granted
to
it
but
pushing
the
matter
farther
it
may
pertinently
be
asked
why
does
the
legislature
endow
it
with
power
to
do
anything
that
may
properly
be
done
by
a
natural
person
two
reasons
at
least
appear
first
from
the
corporation
standpoint
it
is
a
matter
of
business
prudence
to
have
its
purpose
and
powers
defined
a
to
enable
it
to
secure
subscribers
to
its
stock
as
no
one
would
like
to
risk
his
money
blindly
and
b
because
thus
only
can
the
directors
be
held
to
accountability
second
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
for
whom
the
legislature
acts
the
defining
is
necessary
in
order
that
corporations
may
be
controlled
and
dangerous
combinations
prevented
in
this
connection
it
may
be
noted
that
corporations
are
granted
some
privileges
not
possessed
by
individuals
for
instance
private
property
such
as
land
may
be
taken
even
against
the
wishes
of
the
owner
to
permit
the
building
of
a
railroad
this
can
be
done
however
only
on
the
ground
of
public
good
and
by
giving
the
owner
just
compensation
a
corporation
like
any
other
person
is
responsible
for
any
contracts
that
it
makes
within
its
charter
it
necessarily
acts
entirely
through
agents
hence
the
law
of
agency
has
an
important
bearing
upon
all
contracts
with
a
corporation
debts
incurred
lie
against
the
corporation
not
as
a
rule
against
the
stockholders
individually
sometimes
stockholders
are
by
the
charter
made
liable
to
limited
extent
say
to
an
amount
equal
to
the
par
value
of
their
stock
some
companies
are
incorporated
so
that
they
may
last
forever
others
are
incorporated
for
a
specified
time
the
latter
expire
by
limitation
or
by
becoming
insolvent
a
corporation
of

it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
these
three
devices
are
of
immense
value
to
the
commercial
world
the
first
by
rendering
available
future
resources
and
the
other
two
by
enabling
payments
to
be
made
safely
a
is
an
unconditional
promise
in
writing
to
pay
a
definite
sum
of
money
at
a
certain
time
to
a
specified
person
a
is
an
order
written
by
one
person
and
addressed
to
another
directing
him
to
pay
a
definite
sum
of
money
at
a
certain
time
to
a
specified
third
party
a
is
a
draft
for
immediate
payment
drawn
upon
a
bank
or
banker
in
the
case
of
a
note
the
person
who
promises
to
pay
is
called
the
of
the
note
and
the
person
named
to
be
paid
the
in
the
case
of
a
draft
or
check
the
person
ordering
the
payment
is
called
the
the
person
addressed
the
drawn
or
the
and
the
person
to
be
paid
the
the
payee
in
any
of
these
cases
may
wish
to
transfer
the
paper
to
some
other
person
for
instance
the
holder
of
the
note
may
wish
to
use
the
money
before
it
is
due
or
the
payee
of
a
draft
may
wish
to
realize
without
going
to
the
drawee
in
either
case
the
desired
accommodation
can
be
secured
only
by
selling
the
paper
to
some
one
else
this
ability
to
be
transferred
is
part
of
what
is
meant
by
the
term
but
this
liability
to
have
to
pay
another
person
than
the
one
named
can
not
be
imposed
upon
the
maker
or
drawer
without
his
consent
this
he
gives
by
inserting
after
the
name
of
the
payee
the
words
or
order
or
the
words
or
bearer
in
the
latter
case
whoever
holds
the
paper
when
it
becomes
due
can
collect
upon
it
in
case
the
former
words
are
used
the
paper
can
be
transferred
only
by
of
which
more
anon
a
very
important
characteristic
of
negotiability
is
that
it
enables
a
person
to
grant
to
another
rights
which
he
may
not
himself
possess
to
illustrate
as
between
the
maker
and
the
payee
a
note
is
a
contract
and
is
binding
only
if
it
has
all
the
requisites
of
a
binding
contract
therefore
if
there
was
no
consideration
or
if
the
note
was
obtained
by
fraud
or
by
intimidation
the
payee
knowing
these
facts
has
no
right
to
collect
upon
the
note
and
he
could
not
by
law
compel
payment
but
with
a
third
party
it
is
different
he
sees
only
the
note
and
may
not
presumably
does
not
know
anything
else
about
the
contract
to
compel
him
before
buying
the
note
to
learn
all
the
details
of
its
history
might
be
embarrassing
to
the
parties
even
where
everything
is
all
right
and
would
certainly
delay
perhaps
materially
the
transfer
therefore
to
enable
people
to
keep
their
business
to
themselves
and
to
facilitate
transfers
of
commercial
paper
it
has
seemed
best
not
to
require
this
investigation
the
law
presumes
that
when
a
person
makes
a
transferable
note
he
has
done
so
deliberately
and
if
loss
ensues
it
says
that
he
must
bear
it
rather
than
the
innocent
purchaser
of
his
note
conditions
of
but
this
peculiar
protection
is
given
be
it
observed
only
to
an
if
in
good
faith
in
the
regular
course
of
business
a
person
comes
into
possession
of
commercial
paper
negotiable
in
form
not
yet
mature
and
for
which
he
has
given
a
reasonable
consideration
he
can
collect
on
it
on
the
other
hand
if
he
has
found
the
paper
or
stolen
it
or
if
he
has
bought
it
under
circumstances
calculated
to
raise
a
suspicion
as
to
right
of
the
seller
he
should
not
have
and
will
not
by
law
receive
this
privilege
thus
if
a
man
is
offered
commercial
paper
of
perfectly
responsible
parties
at
its
value
it
would
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
person
offering
it
had
found
or
stolen
it
and
the
buyer
would
obtain
only
the
rights
of
the
person
from
whom
he
bought
or
if
a
note
past
due
is
offered
for
sale
the
presumption
is
that
it
is
paid
or
that
it
is
for
some
reason
uncollectable
and
the
purchaser
would
buy
at
his
peril
in
other
words
there
is
anything
on
the
face
of
the
paper
or
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
warn
the
purchaser
he
buys
at
his
own
and
secures
only
such
rights
as
the
vendor
has
negotiable
paper
with
the
words

if

of

and
his

that
the

to
a
specified
person
an
indorsement
in
blank
consists
simply
of
the
signature
of
the

the
effect
of
the
latter
mode
of

is
to
make
the
paper
payable

responsibility
of
a

being
a
contract
the
maker
of

to
the

has
been
said
only

all
the
requisites
of
a

he
is

innocent
purchaser

it

the

drawn
upon

know
nothing
of
the

he
can
not
be
made
a
party
to
a
contract
without
his
knowledge
and
consent
that
he
may
have
knowledge
of
the
draft
it
must
be
presented
to
him
if
upon
seeing
it
he
is
willing
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
paying
it
when
due
he
signifies
his
willingness
by
writing
across
the
face
of
the
draft
the
word
accepted
with
the
date
of
presentation
and
his
name
the
draft
thereby
becomes
his
unconditional
promise
and
he
becomes
the
principal
debtor
occupying
the
position
of
a
maker
of
a
note
responsibility
of
when
a
person
endorses
any
commercial
paper
he
not
only
expresses
thereby
his
consent
to
the
transfer
of
it
but
he
also
enters
into
a
conditional
contract
with
each
person
who
may
afterward
come
into
possession
of
the
paper
whereby
he
becomes
responsible
for
its
payment
if
the
principal
debtor
fails
to
meet
his
obligation
to
fix
responsibility
upon
an
indorser
payment
must
be
demanded
of
the
principal
debtor
on
the
very
day
when
the
obligation
matures
and
if
payment
is
not
made
notice
of
the
fact
must
be
sent
to
the
indorser
before
the
end
of
the
following
day
responsibility
of
between
the
drawer
and
the
payee
a
draft
is
a
conditional
contract
whereby
the
former
impliedly
agrees
to
pay
the
draft
if
the
person
drawn
upon
does
not
his
obligation
is
that
of
a
surety
or
first
indorser
to
fix
responsibility
upon
the
drawer
the
holder
of
the
draft
must
promptly
present
it
for
acceptance
to
the
person
drawn
upon
then
if
it
is
not
accepted
he
must
immediately
notify
the
drawer
forged
forgery
is
the
fraudulent
making
or
altering
of
a
written
instrument
one
whose
name
is
forged
can
not
be
made
responsible
since
the
act
is
not
his
and
since
money
paid
under
a
mistake
must
be
refunded
a
person
who
deceived
by
the
skill
of
the
forger
should
pay
the
seeming
obligation
would
be
entitled
to
get
his
money
back
but
every
person
is
bound
to
use
reasonable
effort
to
prevent
forgery
thus
if
a
merchant
writes
out
a
note
all
but
the
amount
and
authorizes
a
clerk
to
put
that
in
at
some
other
time
and
the
clerk
inserts
a
larger
sum
any
innocent
purchaser
can
compel
the
merchant
to
pay
the
full
amount
in
some
states
it
is
held
that
a
person
who
leaves
space
in
an
obligation
wherein
the
amount
can
readily
be
raised
is
bound
to
stand
the
loss
caused
by
his
negligence

a
man
may
be
perfectly
willing
to
lend
a
friend
some
money
and
yet
be
unable
to
do
so
he
may
however
in
any
one
of

ways

because
the
contract
between

lacks
consideration
but

be
responsible
to
an
innocent
purchaser
because
there
is
nothing
on
the

paper
to
indicate

appendix
how
some
things
are
done
how
taxes
are
levied
taxes
may
be
defined
as
the
moneys
contributed
by
the
people
to
defray
the
public
expenses
they
are
spoken
of
as
direct
and
indirect
the
former
being
paid
as
taxes
the
latter
as
part
of
the
price
of
a
commodity
within
the
local
and
state
taxes
are
all
direct
they
are
meant
to
be
proportioned
to
a
person
ability
to
pay
in
fact
however
a
tax
is
based
upon
the
value
of
his
the
value
of
such
property
is
estimated
by
local
officers
called
assessors
the
estimates
of
these
officers
are
reviewed
by
the
local
board
and
the
reviewed
estimates
are
again
examined
and
equalized
by
the
county
board
but
assessors
local
boards
and
county
boards
are
all
tempted
to
make
the
estimates
low
to
reduce
their
share
of
taxation
for
the
use
of
the
state
so
a
final
review
is
made
by
the
state
board
of
equalization
the
final
estimates
being
reported
to
the
computing
officer
and
the
various
sums
to
be
raised
having
been
reported
to
him
he
finds
the
of
taxation
computes
the
taxes
and
turns
the
books
over
to
the
collecting
officer
certain
classes
of
property
are
exempt
from
taxation
among
those
usually
exempt
may
be
mentioned
property
owned
by
the
united
states
the
state
or
the
municipal
corporation
church
property
educational
and
charitable
institutions
and
a
certain
amount
of
personal
property
united
states
bonds
can
not
be
taxed
by
the
general
the
sources
of
revenue
to
the
general
government
are
customs
excises
direct
taxes
public
lands
receipts
from
post
offices
patents
copyrights
fines
escheats
the
last
two
classes
can
not
be
called
taxes
as
it
can
not
compel
a
state
to
collect
taxes
for
it
the
general
government
is
practically
barred
on
account
of
expense
from
laying
direct
taxes
so
that
it
is
practically
true
that
national
taxation
is
all
indirect
the
customs
are
duties
on
imports
the
excises
or
internal
revenue
consist
of
taxes
on
tobacco
fermented
and
alcoholic
liquors
a
difficult
though
taxes
have
been
levied
for
untold
centuries
it
is
still
one
of
the
unsolved
problems
how
to
levy
them
so
as
to
be
just
to
all
much
progress
has
been
made
but
entirely
satisfactory
answers
have
not
yet
been
wrought
out
to
the
questions
what
are
the
proper
things
to
tax
for
what
purposes
should
taxes
be
levied
how
the
government
borrows
when
an
individual
wishes
to
borrow
money
he
looks
around
for
some
one
who
has
the
money
to
spare
and
who
has
confidence
enough
in
him
to
let
him
have
it
he
gives
his
note
or
bond
and
gets
the
money
similarly
the
united
states
borrows
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
looks
for
lenders
in
the
of
the
world
consults
great
and
sometimes
advertises
in
newspapers
a
private
borrower
pays
for
the
use
of
the
money
and
similarly
the
debt
of
the
united
states
is
largely
the
notes
called
greenbacks
bear
no
interest
because
being
legal
tender
they
circulate
as
money
as
do
also
the
gold
and
silver
certificates
of
deposit
how
national
banks
are
established
associations
for
carrying
on
the
business
of
banking

be
formed
by
any
number

persons
not
less
than
five
a
signed

of
the

giving
the

and
their
owners
the
minimum
capital
required
is

of
less
than
inhabitants
less

others
such
associations
have
the
usual
corporate
and
banking
powers
in
addition
they
may
issue
their
notes
to
circulate
as
currency
on
the
following
conditions
upon
depositing
with
the
treasurer
registered
bonds
of
the
united
states
to
an
amount
not
less
than
nor
less
than
of
its
capital
the
bank
receives
from
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
blank
notes
of
face
value
not
to
exceed
ninety
per
cent
of
the
par
value
of
the
bonds
these
notes
after
being
signed
by
the
president
and
the
cashier
of
the
bank
may
circulate
as
money
but
are
not
legal
tender
for
private
debts

revised

of
how

one
of
the
things
that
makes
citizenship
desirable
is
the
protection
which
it
secures
this
is
particularly
grateful
when
one
is
in
a
foreign
country
what
a
feeling
of
strength
and
security
one
has
when
far
away
from
home
among

to
know

must

passport
is
an
instrument
in

issued
by
the
secretary
of

and
under
his
seal
informing
the
world
that
the
bearer
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
that
he
travels
under
its
protection
that
passport
is
a
means
of
identification
for
the
bearer
and
secures
to
him
all
the
rights
and
privileges
guaranteed
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
by
treaties
with
the
country
in
which
he
may
be
traveling
passports
as
a
means
of
ingress
or
egress
are
now
required
in
only
a
few
countries
of
europe
for
the
convenience
of
citizens
who
may
have
left
home
without
securing
passports
arrangements
have
been
made
whereby
they
may
be
obtained
from
our
representatives
in
foreign
countries
another
kind
of
passport
is
that
for
american
ships
each
obtains
one
before
leaving
for
a
foreign
port
it
tells
the
nationality
of
the
ship
shows
that
she
is
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
these
are
the
business
representatives
of
the

lands
they
are
the
guardians
of
their
countrymen
against
the
vexations
injuries
and
injustices
of
the
country
where
they
reside
and
they
exercise
certain
police
powers
over
all
the
individuals
of
their
nation
within
their
respective
consulates
the
origin
of
consulates
dates
back
to
the
time
of
the
crusades
they
were
instituted
by
the
great
commercial
cities
of
the
mediterranean
the
pisans
venetians
and
genoese
had
in
various
parts
of
asia
and
they
secured
from
the
princes
of
the
countries
where
these
were
located
the
right
to
have
judges
or
arbitrators
of
their
own
nation
located
at
each
of
these
posts
who
were
privileged
to
settle
disputes
between
citizens
of
these
cities
in
accordance
with
their
own
laws
at
first
then
the
consuls
were
only
arbitrators
in
commercial
matters
but
their
prerogatives
have
increased
until
now
they
are
intrusted
with
the
protection
of
merchants
of
their
country
in
their
relations
with
the
countries
to
which
they
come
to
trade
in
some
countries
such
as
china
japan
siam
and
turkey
our
consuls
are
by
treaty
invested
with
judicial
powers
they
try
and
punish
american
citizens
for
crimes
committed
there
incidentally
it
is
the
duty
of
a
consul
to
provide
for
sick
disabled
or
destitute
american
seamen
and
to
send
them
home
to
the
united
states
to
receive
and
take
care
of
the
personal
property
of
any
american
citizen
who
dies
within
his
consulate
and
to
forward
to
the
secretary
of
state
the
balance
remaining
after
the
necessary
funeral
expenses
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
heirs
see

some
of
the
consular
reports
contain
very
valuable
information
regarding
the
products
and
industries
of
the

reports
can
sometimes
be

preventable
diseases
such
as
diphtheria
typhoid
fever
by
requiring
cleanliness
in

and
alleys
and
against

by
requiring

the
government
also
supports
hospitals
for
the
care
of
the
sick
to
secure
to
each
person
as
good
a
reputation
as
his
character
will
warrant
it
is
made
a
crime
to
make
false
and
malicious
statements
about
any
one
if
spoken
the
malicious
statement
is
called
slander
if
written
or
printed
it
is
called
libel
the
essential
elements
of
these
crimes
are
malice
and
injury
if
a
false
statement
is
made
without
intent
to
injure
it
is
not
slander
and
a
true
statement
injuring
another
must
not
be
made
except
for
a
proper
purpose
this
includes
all
those
rights
guaranteed
in
the

of

of
the
several
constitutions
and
the
right
to

how
elections
are
conducted
the
voters
of
each
state
are
designated
by
the
constitution
thereof
see
page
the
time
of
elections
is
usually
also
a
matter
of
constitutional
provision
the
local
town
village
and
city
elections
are
in
most
if
not
all
of
the
states
held
in
the
spring
probably
because
the
public
improvements
contemplated
are
to
be
made
chiefly
in
the
summer
the
general
elections
are
held
in
the
fall
this
may
be
partly
at
least
in
order
that
the
official
year
may
begin
with
the
calendar
year
towns
villages
and
city
wards
are
the
usual
election
precincts
but
any
of
these
may
be
divided
if
necessary
the
location
of
the
is
determined
by
the
convenience
of
the
voters
each
is
in
charge
of
supervisors
of
election
usually
three
in
towns
and
villages
the
regular
trustees
supervise
the
elections
in
cities
three
persons
for
each
precinct
are
appointed
to
act
by
the
council
or
by
the
mayor
the
supervisors
are
assisted
by
one
or
two
clerks
to
prevent
fraud
it
is
required
that
a
person
shall
have
been
a
resident
of
the
precinct
in
which
he
offers
to
vote
for
at
least
ten
days
in
the
cities
where
population
fluctuates
greatly
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
require
voters
to
register
before
the
day
of
election
that
is
to
enroll
their
names
and
places
of
residence
with
the
officers
of
election
due
notice
of
the
times
and
places
of
registration
and
election
is
given
at
least
ten
days
in
advance
this
is
by
ballot
the
two
chief
reasons
being
to
permit
the
voter
to
express
his
choice
uninfluenced
by
any
one
else
to
facilitate
the
voting
the
voter
hands
to
the
chairman
of
the
supervisors
his
ballot
folded
so
as
to
conceal
the
names
after
ascertaining
from
the
other
supervisors
that
the
name
of
the
person
offering
the
vote
is
registered
or
being
satisfied
in
some
other
way
that
he
is
entitled
to
vote
the
chairman
in
the
presence
of
the
voter
deposits
the
ballot
in
the
box
the
name
is
then
checked
on
the
register
and
enrolled
by
the
clerks
on
the
list
of
persons
who
have
voted
each
name
as
it
is
written
by
the
clerks
is
numbered
and
the
supervisors
in
checking
the
register
do
so
by
writing
the
number
of
the
vote
at
the
close
of
the
polls
therefore
the
number
of
persons
who
have
voted
is
known
the
ballots
are
then
turned
out
of
the
box
upon
a
table
and
without
being
unfolded
are
carefully
counted
to
see
whether
they
correspond
in
number
with
the
records
if
as
once
in
a
while
happens
it
is
found
that
there
are
too
many
ballots
those
in
excess
are
drawn
from
the
pile
by
the
supervisors
and
destroyed
the
ballots
are
then
unfolded
and
the
count
of
the
persons
voted
for
is
carefully
made
and
recorded
these
proceedings
are
all
open
to
the
public
in
local
elections
the
result
of
the
vote
is
read
by
a
clerk
to
those
present
an
abstract
of
the
vote
is
filed
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
corporation
and
a
list
of
the
persons
elected
is
sent
to
the
auditor
clerk
of
the
county
the
names
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
and
the
constables
are
reported
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
general
elections
the
abstract
of
the
vote
is
sent
to
the
county
auditor
he
makes
a
general
abstract
of
the
vote
of
the
county
on
state
officers
members
of
congress
and
presidential
electors
and
sends
it
to
the
state
auditor
he
also
sends
to
the
same
officer
a
list
of
the
persons
elected
to
county
offices
an
abstract
of
the
vote
is
published
in
one
or
more
of
the
county
papers
canvassing
the
persons
composing
these
boards
are
designated
by
statute
the
secretary
of
the
organization
is
always
a
member
he
is
usually
assisted
by
two
or
more
judicial
officers
certificates
of
these
are
furnished
to
by
the
secretary
of
the
organization
certificates
of
members
of
congress
and
presidential
electors
are
signed
by
the
governor
and
the
secretary
of
state
and
are
authenticated
by
the
state
seal
with
all
the
thought
that
has
been
given
to
the
subject
it
is
still
an
unsolved
problem
how
to
secure
a
free
vote
and
a
fair
count
of
the
two
purposes
given
above
to
be
subserved
by
the
use
of
the
ballot
rather
than
by
voting
the
first
is
too
commonly
not
realized
perhaps
the
greatest
danger
to
our
government
is
bribery
or
overawing
of
the
voter
a
remedy
the
main
reliance
for
the
purity
of
the
ballot
must
of
course
be
the
intelligence
and
uprightness
of
the
people
and
he
who
enlightens
and
uplifts
one
or
more
individuals
is
to
that
extent
truly
a
patriot
the
second
reliance
is
the
removal
of
temptation
there
may
be
honor
among
thieves
but
wrong
doing
makes
a
person
suspicious
and
if
the
briber
can
not
see
the
bribed
deposit
his
ballot
he
has
no
good
reason
for
believing
that
he
did
as
directed
in
australia
they
have
a
plan
which
seems
to
obviate
bribery
and
to
have
certain
other
incidental
advantages
the
plan
includes
two
main
features
the
printing
of
ballots
at
state
expense
the
ballots
to
contain
all
the
nominees
of
all
the
parties
and
appropriate
blank
spaces
for
the
insertion
of
other
names
the
secret
preparation
of
the
ballot
by
the
voter
and
his
casting
it
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
only
the
operation
of
the
plan
slightly
modified
as
now
proposed
in
massachusetts
is
briefly
this
in
the
polling
room
as
now
is
the
this
none
but
those
in
the
act
of
voting
and
the
officers
are
allowed
to
approach
as
the
voters
enter
the
enclosed
area
a
stile
numbers
them
and
an
officer
hands
each
a
ballot
containing
the
names
of
all
nominees
the
voter
takes
this
into
a
booth
and
makes
a
cross
in
ink
opposite
the
name
of
each
person
that
he
wishes
to
vote
for
having
thus
prepared
his
ballot
alone
he
deposits
it
in
the
usual
way
the
advantages
promised
by
this
plan
are
obvious
the
printing
of
the
ballots
at
state
expense
would
do
away
with
one
of
the
pretexts
for
bleeding
a
candidate
for
legitimate
expenses
it
would
take
their
occupation
from
the
and
do
away
with
the
deceiving
pasters
the
electors
would
be
freed
from
the
nuisance
of
personal
solicitation
or
dictation
the
would
be
quieter
and
more
orderly
best
of
all
it
would
greatly
minify
the
evils
of
bribery
for
reasons
given
above
the
principle
is
certainly
a
good
one
and
the
machinery
is
worthy
of
the
careful
consideration
of
our
legislators
later
this
system
is
now
used
in
several
states
why
and
how
nominations
are
made
a
political
party
may
be
defined
as
a
number
of
persons
holding
similar
views
in
relation
to
one
or
more
questions
of
public
policy
and
who
through
unity
of
action
seek
to
have
these
views
prevail
the
great
instrument
for
securing
unity
is
the
convention
it
may
be
a
mass
meeting
or
as
is
more
usual
among
the
large
and
parties
a
convention
of
delegates
in
either
case
it
is
be
it
remembered
not
a
part
of
the
elective
machinery
designed
by
the
legislature
but
a
political
device
to
increase
the
chances
of
victory
through
unity
of
purpose
and
action
party
organization
consists
of
committees
town
village
county
state
and
national
the
local
committees
are
chosen
by
the
resident
partisans
the
county
committees
by
the
county
conventions
the
state
committees
by
state
conventions
and
the
national
committee
consisting
usually
of
one
member
from
each
state
by
the
delegates
of
the
respective
states
to
the
national
convention
each
committee
chooses
its
own
chairman
and
secretary
besides
those
mentioned
there
are
district
committees
such
as
committees
committees
whose
members
are
appointed
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
given
above
the
term
of
a
member
is
as
might
be
expected
from
the
close
of
one
regular
convention
to
the
close
of
the
succeeding
one
thus
a
town
committeeman
term
is
one
year
while
that
of
a
national
committeeman
is
four
years
the
mode
of
nominating
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
will
illustrate
the
way
of
making
nominations
in
general
by
practice
each
state
is
entitled
to
twice
as
many
delegates
to
the
national
convention
as
the
number
of
its
presidential
electors
and
each
territory
to
two
delegates
thus
minnesota
being
entitled
to
nine
electors
may
send
eighteen
delegates
and
new
york
having
electors
is
entitled
to
delegates
each
delegate
has
an
alternate
who
acts
in
the
delegate
absence
though
the
popular
election
does
not
take
place
until
november
the
national
conventions
are
usually
held
in
june
or
july
this
is
probably
to
allow
plenty
of
time
for
the
campaign
to
allow
the
machinery
time
to
grind
out
the
delegates
the
national
committee
having
early
determined
upon
the
time
and
place
for
holding
the
convention
issues
its
call
some
months
in
advance
say
in
february
or
march
this
is
published
in
the
newspapers
throughout
the
country
the
next
step
in
the
process
is
the
issuance
of
calls
by
the
several
state
committees
these
are
issued
as
soon
as
practicable
after
that
of
the
national
committee
and
usually
appoint
the
state
convention
for
the
latter
part
of
may
in
some
states
all
of
the
delegates
to
the
national
convention
are
chosen
by
the
state
convention
but
the
number
of
states
is
increasing
and
properly
so
in
which
each
congressional
district
chooses
its
own
two
delegates
leaving
only
the
four
delegates
at
large
to
be
chosen
by
the
state
convention
in
these
states
the
next
step
is
the
call
of
the
district
committee
for
a
convention
slightly
antedating
that
of
the
state
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
district
call
is
announced
the
several
county
committees
issue
their
call
for
county
conventions
to
be
held
shortly
before
the
district
convention
lastly
the
local
committees
issue
their
calls
usually
giving
a
week
or
ten
days
notice
the
local
convention
is
called
a
caucus
then
in
succession
the
local
county
district
state
and
national
conventions
are
held
the
caucuses
send
representatives
to
the
county
conventions
which
in
turn
choose
the
deputations
to
the
district
and
state
conventions
and
these
finally
select
the
delegates
to
the
national
convention
an
equal
number
of
alternates
are
chosen
at
the
same
time
the
state
convention
also
names
the
presidential
electors
to
be
supported
by
the
party
thus
the
national
convention
is
the
first
to
be
called
and
the
last
to
be
held
while
the
caucuses
are
the
last
to
be
called
and
the
first
to
be
held
the
caucuses
are
the
real
for
the
people
the
delegates
from
each
convention
receive
certificates
of
election
signed
by
the
chairman
and
secretary
thereof
these
credentials
are
given
to
prevent
fraud
and
constitute
the
delegates
title
to
seats
in
the
convention
to
which
they
are
sent
the
first
step
taken
in
the
national
convention
after
securing
a
temporary
organization
is
the
appointment
of
a
committee
on
credentials
and
another
on
permanent
organization
by
the
temporary
chairman
when
the
former
committee
reports
it
is
known
who
are
entitled
to
participate
in
the
proceedings
and
when
the
latter
committee
reports
the
convention
almost
invariably
adopts
the
report
and
thereby
perfects
its
organization
a
committee
on
rules
and
one
on
platform
are
then
appointed
the
states
are
then
called
in
alphabetical
order
and
each
one
that
cares
to
presents
to
the
convention
the
name
of
her
favorite
son
thus
in
the
republican
convention
of
when
illinois
was
called
the
name
of
abraham
lincoln
was
presented
and
when
new
york
was
called
the
name
of
william
seward
was
presented
and
so
on
when
the
roll
of
the
states
is
completed
the
balloting
begins
in
the
republican
convention

constitution
amendment
xii
the
constitution
gives
no
directions
as
to
the
manner
of
counting
no
trouble
was
experienced
however
until
the
election
the
result
of
this
election
depended
upon
the
votes
of
three
states
each
of
which
sent
in
two
conflicting
sets
of
certificates
there
being
no
legal
provision
for
the
settlement
of
such
disputes
the
famous
electoral
commission
was
created
to
determine
which
certificates
should
be
counted
it
consisted
of
five
senators
five
representatives
and
five
justices
of
the
supreme
court
the
gravity
of
the
danger
thus
revealed
made
it
obviously
necessary
that
some
general
plan
be
devised
whereby
such
disputes
might
be
obviated
though
consideration
of
the
subject
began
at
once
and
various
measures
were
from
time
to
time
proposed
no
satisfactory
solution
was
presented
until
february
when
the
electoral
count
bill
was
passed
and
received
the
signature
of
the
president
an
outline
of
the
bill

the
new
law
the
electors
do
not
meet
until
the

the
inconsitency
was
remedied
however
by
a
supplementary
act
providing
that
certificates
shall
be
forwarded
as
soon
as
possible
and
authorizing
the
president

science
the
duty
of
extradition
between
the
states
of
this
republic
is
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution
iv
and
the
mode
of
procedure
is
prescribed
by
an
act

passed
in

other
crimes
used
in

constitution
is
generally
interpreted
so
as
to
include
any
offense
against
the
laws

the
state
or
territory
making
the
demand
on
the
question
whether
the
executive
upon
whom
demand
is
made
is
bound
to
comply
the
federal
courts
have
decided
that
his
duty
in
the
matter
is
imperative
that
he
must
deliver
up
the
fugitive
unless
the
accused
shall
also
be
under
prosecution
for
breach
of
the
laws
of
the
state
to
which
he
has
fled
the
procedure
is
this
the
accused
must
be
indicted
in
the
state
in
which
the
crime
was
committed

a
charge
must

issues
to
the
executive

has
gone
a
requisition
for
his
surrender

executive
upon
whom

extradition
is
regarded
as
a
matter
of
comity
and
is
based
upon
special
treaty
in
this
country
power
to
make
such
a
surrender
is
conferred
upon
the
executive
footnote
this
of
course
means
the
president
as
states
can
not
treat
with
foreign
powers
only
where
the
united
states
are
bound
by
treaty
and
have
a
reciprocal
right
to
claim
similar
surrender
from
the
other
power
in
relation
to
the
crimes
for
which
extradition
may
be
demanded
it
may
be
said
in
general
that
they
are
specified
in
the
treaty
and
are
such
offenses
as
are
recognized
as
crimes
by
both
countries
consequently
no
two
treaties
are
exactly
alike
generally
only
things
wrong
in
themselves
not
things
wrong
by
local
prohibition
are
included
offenses
merely
political
are
not
included
and
as
opinions
differ
in
different
countries
on
what
constitutes
a
political
crime
the
surrendering
nation
is
very
properly
made
the
judge
of
this
question
as
a
corollary
to
the
preceding
it
is
a
rule
of
international
law
that
the
surrendered
party
can
be
tried
only
on
the
allegations
for
which
extradition
has
been
accorded

principle

only
general
courts
martial
have
jurisdiction
of
capital
offenses
there
are
two
marked
characteristics
of
courts
martial
first
the
accused
is
tried
not
as
in
a
civil
court
by
his
peers
but
by
his
superiors
second
there
is
no
distinction
between
judge
and
jury
the
officers
comprising
the
court
act
in
both
capacities

determine
the
fact
and
apply
the
law

vote
except
that

the
findings
of

martial
must
in
each
case
be
transmitted
to
the
convening
authority
and
by
it
be
approved
before
being
carried
into
execution
in
time
of

no
sentence

martial
involving

or
the
dismissal

either
in

no

be
carried
into

without
approval
by

jurisdiction
of

service
of

country
why
and
how
territories
are
organized
the
organization
of
territories
in
the
united
states
is
for
two
purposes
to
provide
good
government
while
population
is
sparse
and
to
encourage
their
development
into
commonwealths
and
their
incorporation
into
the
federal
system
as
rapidly
as
possible
see
page
territories
are
organized
by
congress
in
the
organic
act
the
boundaries
of
the
territory
are
defined
and
a
system
of
government
is
established
the
governor
and
the
administrative
and
judicial
officers
are
appointed
by
the
president
but
a
territorial
legislature
is
entrusted
with
limited
powers
subject
to

on
subjects
in

is
interested
but
he
can
not

why
and
how
the
public
lands
are
surveyed
the
public
lands
are
not
meant
to
be
held
forever
by
the
general
government
they
are
designed
to
be
owned
and
occupied
by
american
citizens
to
divide
the
land
into
pieces
and
thus
to
facilitate
the
description
and
the
location
of
any
piece
is
the
principal
purpose
of
the
survey
incidentally
the
portions
six
miles
square
serve
as
bases
for
the
political
divisions
called
towns
and
this
was
part
of
the
original
plan
the
old
thirteen
and
maine
vermont
kentucky
tennessee
and
west
virginia
were
surveyed
in
a
very
irregular
way
lands
were
described
as
bounded
by
lines
running
from
stumps
to
stones
thence
to
a
creek
and
down
the
main
channel
thereof
in
a
committee
of
the
continental
congress
was
appointed
with
thomas
jefferson
as
chairman
to
devise
a
simple
and
uniform
mode
of
surveying
the
public
lands
in
what
was
about
to
be
organized
as
the
northwest
territory
the
most
noticeable
peculiarity
of
the
system
is
that
it
is
rectangular
a
prime
meridian
is
first
determined
then
a
baseline
crossing
it
at
right
angles
then
from
points
on
the
baseline
six
miles
and
multiples
thereof
from
the
meridian
lines
are
run
due
north
and
parallels
to
the
are
run
at
distances
of
six
miles
the
approximate
squares
thus
formed
are
called
townships
the
rows
of
townships
running
north
and
south
are
called
ranges
townships
are
numbered
north
and
south
from
the
ranges
east
and
west
from
the
meridian
the
diagram
on
page
illustrates
the
system
since
meridians
all
terminate
at
the
poles
the
lines
between
ranges
being
meridians
gradually
approach
each
other
as
they
go
northward
the
lines
then
soon
become
so
much
less
than
six
miles
apart
that
a
new
beginning
has
to
be
made
the
parallel
upon
which
this
correction

international

is
a
matter
of
comparatively
recent
origin
and
exists
only
among
the
most
highly
civilized

not

the
enactment

having
no
courts
competent

the
great
purpose

being
to

by
removing

we
shall
first
consider
some
of
the
arrangements
operative
in
times
of
peace
among
individuals
it

that
as

rule
it
is
best
for
each
person
to
mind
his
own
business
similarly
among
nations
by
one
with
the
internal
affairs
of
another
is
a
cardinal
principle
it
is
therefore
a
general
rule
that
a
people
may
adopt
such
form
of
government
as
they
choose
and
that
whenever
they
wish
they
may
amend
or
entirely
alter

it
is
sometimes
a
delicate
question
to
determine
whether
to
recognize
a
community
as
a
nation
or
not
thus
if
a
dependency
is
seeking
to
become
independent
our
personal
sympathies
are
naturally
with
it
and
yet
it
might
be
contrary
to
the
law

unfriendly
act
to

sovereign
power
for
our
government
to
recognize
its
independence

of

colonies
for

political
existence
john
quincy
adams
then
secretary
of
state
formulated
the
proper
rule
of
action
thus
in
every
question
relating
to
the
independence
of
a
nation
two
principles
are
involved
one
of
right
and
the
other
of
fact
the
former
exclusively
depending
upon
the
determination
of
the
nation
itself
and
the
latter
resulting
from
the
successful
execution
of
that
determination
the
government
of
the
united
states
yielded
to
an
obligation
of
duty
of
the
highest
order
by
recognizing
as
independent
states
nations
which
after
deliberately
asserting
their
right
to
that
character
have
maintained
and
established
it
against
all
the
resistance
which
had
been
or
could
be
brought
to
oppose
it
this
recognition
is
the
mere
acknowledgment

in

claim

authorities
because
receiving
the
ambassador
of

equivalent
to
recognizing

without

decline

treaties
are
contracts
between
nations
and
in
international
law
much
resemble
ordinary
contracts
in
municipal
law
for
instance
they
can
be
made
only
by
certain
persons
the
constituted
authorities
of
nations
or
by
persons
specially
deputed
by
them
for
that
purpose
a
treaty
can
not
obligate
to
do
an
unlawful
act
there
must
be
consideration
a
treaty
which
sacrifices
the
interests
of
one
party
is
not
binding
upon
that
party
treaties
obtained
by
fraud
or
force
are
not
binding
footnote
this
from
woolsey
international
law
is
too
good
to
be
omitted
a
contract
is
one
of
the
highest
acts
of
human
it
is
the
will
binding
itself
in
regard
to
the
future
and
surrendering
its
right
to
change
expressed
intention
so
that
it
becomes
morally
and
jurally
a
wrong
to
act
otherwise
it
is
the
act
of
two
parties
in
which
each
or
one
of
the
two
conveys
power
over
himself
to
the
other
in
consideration
of
something
done
or
to
be
done
by
the
other
the
binding
force
of
contracts
is
to
be
deduced
from
the
freedom
and
foresight
of
man
which
would
have
almost
no
sphere
in
society
or
power
of
unless
trust
could
be
excited
trust
lies
at
the
basis
of
society
society
is
essential
for
the
development
of
the
individual
the
individual
could
not
develop
his
free
forethought
unless
an
acknowledged
obligation
made
him
sure
in
regard
to
the
actions
of
others
that
nations
as
well
as
individuals
are
bound
by
contract
will
not
be
doubted
when
we
remember
that
they
have
the
same
properties
of
free
will
and
foresight
that
they
can
have
no
safe
intercourse
otherwise
further
similarity
between
municipal
and
international
law
is
to
be
seen
the
minister
appointed
to
negotiate
the
treaty
is
an
agent
and
his
work
is
subject
to
the
general
law
of
agency
thus
if
he
acts
within
his
instructions
his
principal
the
nation
is
bound
by
what
he
does
and
the
power
is
in
honor
bound
to
ratify
the
treaty
from
this
it
will
properly
be
inferred
that
there
is
an
implied
understanding
that
the
sovereign
or
other
power
intrusted
with
the
making
of
treaties
reserves
the
right
to
accept
or
reject
the
work
of
the
agent

for

it
may
be

war

international
law
assumes
that
there
must

fightings
among
nations
and
endeavors
to
lay
down
rules
by
which
they
shall
be
brought
within
the
limits
of
justice
and
humanity
a
nation
may
wage
war
to
defend
any
right
which
as
a
state
it
is
bound
to
protect
to
redress
wrong
or
to
prevent
injury
for
instance
to
defend
its
own
sovereignty
to
protect
a
citizen
in
his
rights
to
obtain
satisfaction
for
insults
to
its

its

or
its
good
name
for
the
violation
of

conquering

not
now
recognized
as
legitimate
war
between
independent
sovereignties
is
and
ought
to
be
an
way
of
obtaining
justice
even
among
the
ancients
announcements
were
usually
made
before
war
was
begun
the
greeks
sent
a
herald
to
carry
the
news
among
the
romans
the
ceremonies
of
making
known
the
state
of
war
were
very
punctilious
but
formal
declarations
of
war
are
now
falling
into
disuse
not
from
any
intention
of
taking
the
enemy
unawares
but
because
of
the
rapidity
with
which
news
is
now
disseminated
still
a
state
is
in
honor
bound
to
indicate
in
some
way
its
changed
relation
this
is
due
to
the
enemy
and
just
to
its
own
citizens
and
to
neutrals
that
they
may
know
how
to
act
the
enemy
is
usually
informed
by
the
peremptory
dismissal
of
its
ambassador
the
citizens
and
neutrals
by
a
manifesto
of
some
kind
see
between
war
being
an
interruption
of
peaceful
relations
commerce
between
the
citizens
is
at
an
end
is
forbidden
contracts
between
them
then
become
either
impossible
in
their
nature
or
unlawful
and
therefore
void
the
war
is
not
between
the
individual
citizens
of
the
two
countries
it
is
between
the
governments
and
is
waged
by
authorized
agents
the
soldiers
and
sailors
enlisted
for
the
purpose
the
smallest
amount
of
injury
consistent
with
and
the
sad
necessity
of
war
is
to
be
inflicted
passive
citizens
are
not
unnecessarily
to
be
molested
not
all
things
are
fair
in
war
though
ingenuity
may
properly
tax
itself
to
produce
instruments
underhanded
means
such
as
poisoning
springs
or
spreading
a
plague
are
condemned
nor
is
it
now
regarded
as
consistent
with
right
for
a
civilized
nation
to
employ
against
another
persons
accustomed
to
an
inhuman
mode
of
warfare
heralds
and
heralds
bearing
flags
of
truce
are
inviolable
they
must
not
be
molested
spies
unless
in
their
regimentals
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty
if
caught
pirates
and
pirates
acting
under
no
authority
having
no
purpose
to
serve
except
to
enrich
themselves
at
the
expense
of
any
one
else
are
not
protected
by
any
nation
and
may
be
put
to
death
by
any
one
capturing
them
but
privateers
acting
as
an
arm
of
the
government
and
by
its
authority
granted
by
its
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
must
be
treated
as
prisoners
of
war
prisoners
of
prisoners
taken
in
war
were
formerly
the
property
of
their
captors
to
be
used
for
their
pleasure
or
profit
as
slaves
modern
usage
requires
that
they
be
merely
detained
that
they
be
fed
and
sheltered
with
reasonable
comfort
and
not
treated
with
any
unnecessary
harshness
a
common
practice
worthy
of
encouragement
is
that
of
exchanging
prisoners
thus
restoring
them
to
their
own
side
sometimes
too
prisoners
are
released
on
that
is
on
their
word
of
honor
not
to
the
army
if
a
paroled
prisoner
breaks
his
word
in
this
respect
upon
recapture
he
is
liable
to
be
put
to
death
peace
comes
by
treaty
there
is
usually
a
preliminary
treaty
containing
the
general
statement
of
conditions
to
which
both
parties
will
consent
when
all
the
details
have
been
arranged
a
definitive
treaty
is
concluded
treaties
of
peace
go
into
effect
as
between
the
parties
when
they
are
signed
as
between
individuals
of
the
belligerent
nations
when
they
are
notified
rights
and
obligations
of
neutrals
when
intercourse
between
the
countries
of
the
world
was
small
owing
to
lack
of
facilities
the
rights
of
neutrals
were
regarded
as
unimportant
but
intercourse
has
increased
so
enormously
that
no
great
war
can
be
waged
without
interfering
with
the
interests
of
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
the
rights
of
neutrals
are
assuming
more
importance
in
international
law
the
great
obligation
resting
upon
neutrals
is
to
allow
nothing
to
the
belligerents
which
either
would
object
to
as
being
adverse
to
his
interests
what
neutrals
may
the
common
instincts
of
humanity
may
be
complied
with
thus
a
ship
of
war
in
distress
may
run
into
a
neutral
port
soldiers
running
into
neutral
territory
may
be
disarmed
and
then
protected
as
things
it
is
a
breach
of
neutrality
to
lend
money
or
furnish
troops
or
munitions
of
war
to
a
belligerent
or
to
allow
ships
of
war
to
be
built
by
citizens
of
the
neutral
power
within
its
borders
if
it
knows
or
know
that
they
are
to
be
armored
and
used
in
the
service
of
one
of
the
belligerents
citizens
of
neutral
members
of
a
neutral
state
may
lend
money
to
a
belligerent
or
may
go
into
the
army
or
navy
of
a
belligerent
without
breach
of
the
neutrality
of
their
nation
they
may
sell
goods

either
belligerent
a
belligerent
may

a

close
the

of
the

this
is
called
a
blockade
two
things
are
necessary
to
make
a
blockade
valid
due
notice
must
be
given
and
the
blockade
must
be
made
effective

placing
