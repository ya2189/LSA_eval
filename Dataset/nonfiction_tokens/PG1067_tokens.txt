personal
memoirs
of
grant
volume
by
grant
preface
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
there
are
but
few
important
events
in
the
affairs
of
men
brought
about
by
their
own
choice
although
frequently
urged
by
friends
to
write
my
memoirs
i
had
determined
never
to
do
so
nor
to
write
anything
for
publication
at
the
age
of
nearly
i
received
an
injury
from
a
fall
which
confined
me
closely
to
the
house
while
it
did
not
apparently
affect
my
general
health
this
made
study
a
pleasant
pastime
shortly
after
the
rascality
of
a
business
partner
developed
itself
by
the
announcement
of
a
failure
this
was
followed
soon
after
by
universal
depression
of
all
securities
which
seemed
to
threaten
the
extinction
of
a
good
part
of
the
income
still
retained
and
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
the
kindly
act
of
friends
at
this
juncture
the
editor
of
the
century
magazine
asked
me
to
write
a
few
articles
for
him
i
consented
for
the
money
it
gave
me
for
at
that
moment
i
was
living
upon
borrowed
money
the
work
i
found
congenial
and
i
determined
to
continue
it
the
event
is
an
important
one
for
me
for
good
or
evil
i
hope
for
the
former
in
preparing
these
volumes
for
the
public
i
have
entered
upon
the
task
with
the
sincere
desire
to
avoid
doing
injustice
to
any
one
whether
on
the
national
or
confederate
side
other
than
the
unavoidable
injustice
of
not
making
mention
often
where
special
mention
is
due
there
must
be
many
errors
of
omission
in
this
work
because
the
subject
is
too
large
to
be
treated
of
in
two
volumes
in
such
way
as
to
do
justice
to
all
the
officers
and
men
engaged
there
were
thousands
of
instances
during
the
rebellion
of
individual
company
regimental
and
brigade
deeds
of
heroism
which
deserve
special
mention
and
are
not
here
alluded
to
the
troops
engaged
in
them
will
have
to
look
to
the
detailed
reports
of
their
individual
commanders
for
the
full
history
of
those
deeds
the
first
volume
as
well
as
a
portion
of
the
second
was
written
before
i
had
reason
to
suppose
i
was
in
a
critical
condition
of
health
later
i
was
reduced
almost
to
the
point
of
death
and
it
became
impossible
for
me
to
attend
to
anything
for
weeks
i
have
however
somewhat
regained
my
strength
and
am
able
often
to
devote
as
many
hours
a
day
as
a
person
should
devote
to
such
work
i
would
have
more
hope
of
satisfying
the
expectation
of
the
public
if
i
could
have
allowed
myself
more
time
i
have
used
my
best
efforts
with
the
aid
of
my
eldest
son
grant
assisted
by
his
brothers
to
verify
from
the
records
every
statement
of
fact
given
the
comments
are
my
own
and
show
how
i
saw
the
matters
treated
of
whether
others
saw
them
in
the
same
light
or
not
with
these
remarks
i
present
these
volumes
to
the
public
asking
no
favor
but
hoping
they
will
meet
the
approval
of

more
than
forty
years
he

many
years
of
the
time

eldest
son
samuel

and
seventh
from
samuel
mathew

a
few
years
after
their
settlement
in

he
soon
after

with
her
first
husband
had
been
with
him
and
his
first
wife
on
the
ship
mary
and

several

two
or
three
generations
later
i
am
descended
from
both
the
wives
of
mathew
grant
in
the
fifth
descending
generation
my
great
grandfather
noah
grant
and
his
younger
brother
solomon
held
commissions
in
the
english
army
in
in
the
war
against
the
french
and
indians
both
were
killed
that
year
my
grandfather
also
named
noah
was
then
but
nine
years
old
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
after
the
battles
of
concord
and
lexington
he
went
with
a
connecticut
company
to
join
the
continental
army
and
was
present
at
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
he
served
until
the
fall
of
yorktown
or
through
the
entire
revolutionary
war
he
must
however
have
been
on
furlough
part
of
the
time
as
i
believe
most
of
the
soldiers
of
that
period
were
for
he
married
in
connecticut
during
the
war
had
two
children
and
was
a
widower
at
the
close
soon
after
this
he
emigrated
to
westmoreland
county
pennsylvania
and
settled
near
the
town
of
greensburg
in
that
county
he
took
with
him
the
younger
of
his
two
children
peter
grant
the
elder
solomon
remained
with
his
relatives
in
connecticut
until
old
enough
to
do
for
himself
when
he
emigrated
to
the
british
west
indies
not
long
after
his
settlement
in
pennsylvania
my
grandfather
captain
noah
grant
married
a
miss
kelly
and
in
he
emigrated
again
this
time
to
ohio
and
settled
where
the
town
of
deerfield
now
stands
he
had
now
five
children
including
peter
a
son
by
his
first
marriage
my
father
jesse
grant
was
the
second
child
oldest
son
by
the
second
marriage
peter
grant
went
early
to
maysville
kentucky
where
he
was
very
prosperous
married
had
a
family
of
nine
children
and
was
drowned
at
the
mouth
of
the
kanawha
river
virginia
in
being
at
the
time
one
of
the
wealthy
men
of
the
west
my
grandmother
grant
died
in
leaving
seven
children
this
broke
up
the
family
captain
noah
grant
was
not
thrifty
in
the
way
of
laying
up
stores
on
earth
and
after
the
death
of
his
second
wife
he
went
with
the
two
youngest
children
to
live
with
his
son
peter
in
maysville
the
rest
of
the
family
found
homes
in
the
neighborhood
of
deerfield
my
father
in
the
family
of
judge
tod
the
father
of
the
late
governor
tod
of
ohio
his
industry
and
independence
of
character
were
such
that
i
imagine
his
labor
compensated
fully
for
the
expense
of
his
maintenance
there
must
have
been
a
cordiality
in
his
welcome
into
the
tod
family
for
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
looked
upon
judge
tod
and
his
wife
with
all
the
reverence
he
could
have
felt
if
they
had
been
parents
instead
of
benefactors
i
have
often
heard
him
speak
of
tod
as
the
most
admirable
woman
he
had
ever
known
he
remained
with
the
tod
family
only
a
few
years
until
old
enough
to
learn
a
trade
he
went
first
i
believe
with
his
peter
grant
who
though
not
a
tanner
himself
owned
a
tannery
in
maysville
kentucky
here
he
learned
his
trade
and
in
a
few
years
returned
to
deerfield
and
worked
for
and
lived
in
the
family
of
a
brown
the
father
of
john
brown
whose
body
lies
mouldering
in
the
grave
while
his
soul
goes
marching
on
i
have
often
heard
my
father
speak
of
john
brown
particularly
since
the
events
at
harper
ferry
brown
was
a
boy
when
they
lived
in
the
same
house
but
he
knew
him
afterwards
and
regarded
him
as
a
man
of
great
purity
of
character
of
high
moral
and
physical
courage
but
a
fanatic
and
extremist
in
whatever
he
advocated
it
was
certainly
the
act
of
an
insane
man
to
attempt
the
invasion
of
the
south
and
the
overthrow
of
slavery
with
less
than
twenty
men
my
father
set
up
for
himself
in
business
establishing
a
tannery
at
ravenna
the
county
seat
of
portage
county
in
a
few
years
he
removed
from
ravenna
and
set
up
the
same
business
at
point
pleasant
clermont
county
ohio
during
the
minority
of
my
father
the
west
afforded
but
poor
facilities
for
the
most
opulent
of
the
youth
to
acquire
an
education
and
the
majority
were
dependent
almost
exclusively
upon
their
own
exertions
for
whatever
learning
they
obtained
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
his
time
at
school
was
limited
to
six
months
when
he
was
very
young
too
young
indeed
to
learn
much
or
to
appreciate
the
advantages
of
an
education
and
to
a
quarter
schooling
afterwards
probably
while
living
with
judge
tod
but
his
thirst
for
education
was
intense
he
learned
rapidly
and
was
a
constant
reader
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
in
his
eightieth
year
books
were
scarce
in
the
western
reserve
during
his
youth
but
he
read
every
book
he
could
borrow
in
the
neighborhood
where
he
lived
this
scarcity
gave
him
the
early
habit
of
studying
everything
he
read
so
that
when
he
got
through
with
a
book
he
knew
everything
in
it
the
habit
continued
through
life
even
after
reading
the
daily
papers
which
he
never
neglected
he
could
give
all
the
important
information
they
contained
he
made
himself
an
excellent
english
scholar
and
before
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
was
a
constant
contributor
to
western
newspapers
and
was
also
from
that
time
until
he
was
fifty
years
old
an
able
debater
in
the
societies
for
this
purpose
which
were
common
in
the
west
at
that
time
he
always
took
an
active
part
in
politics
but
was
never
a
candidate
for
office
except
i
believe
that
he
was
the
first
mayor
of
georgetown
he
supported
jackson
for
the
presidency
but
he
was
a
whig
a
great
admirer
of
henry
clay
and
never
voted
for
any
other
democrat
for
high
office
after
jackson
my
mother
family
lived
in
montgomery
county
pennsylvania
for
several
generations
i
have
little
information
about
her
ancestors
her
family
took
no
interest
in
genealogy
so
that
my
grandfather
who
died
when
i
was
sixteen
years
old
knew
only
back
to
his
grandfather
on
the
other
side
my
father
took
a
great
interest
in
the
subject
and
in
his
researches
he
found
that
there
was
an
entailed
estate
in
windsor
connecticut
belonging
to
the
family
to
which
his
nephew
lawson
grant
still
living
was
the
heir
he
was
so
much
interested
in
the
subject
that
he
got
his
nephew
to
empower
him
to
act
in
the
matter
and
in
or
when
i
was
a
boy
ten
or
eleven
years
old
he
went
to
windsor
proved
the
title
beyond
dispute
and
perfected
the
claim
of
the
owners
for
a
consideration
three
thousand
dollars
i
think
i
remember
the
circumstance
well
and
remember
too
hearing
him
say
on
his
return
that
he
found
some
widows
living
on
the
property
who
had
little
or
nothing
beyond
their
homes
from
these
he
refused
to
receive
any
recompense
my
mother
father
john
simpson
moved
from
montgomery
county
pennsylvania
to
clermont
county
ohio
about
the
year
taking
with
him
his
four
children
three
daughters
and
one
son
my
mother
hannah
simpson
was
the
third

had
several
children
she
still
lives
in
clermont
county
at
this
writing
october
and
is
over
ninety
ears
of
age
until
her
memory
failed
her
a
few
years
ago
she
thought
the
country
ruined
beyond
recovery
when
the
democratic
party
lost
control
in
her
family
which
was
large
inherited
her
views
with
the
exception
of
one
son
who
settled

was
the
only

and
is
as
active
in
mind
as
ever
he
was
a
supporter
of
the
government
during
the
war

remains
a
firm
believer
that
national
success
by

means
irretrievable
ruin
in
june
my
father
jesse
grant
married
hannah
simpson
i
was
born
on
the
of
april
at
point
pleasant
clermont
county
ohio
in
the
fall
of
we
moved
to
georgetown
the
county
seat
of
brown
the
adjoining
county
east
this
place
remained
my
home
until
at
the
age
of
seventeen
in
i
went
to
west
point
the
schools
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
were
very
indifferent
there
were
no
free
schools
and
none
in
which
the
scholars
were
classified
they
were
all
supported
by
subscription
and
a
single
teacher
who
was
often
a
man
or
a
woman
incapable
of
teaching
much
even
if
they
imparted
all
they
knew
would
have
thirty
or
forty
scholars
male
and
female
from
the
infant
learning
the
a
b
c
up
to
the
young
lady
of
eighteen
and
the
boy
of
twenty
studying
the
highest
branches
taught
the
three
r
reading
i
never
saw
an
algebra
or
other
mathematical
work
higher
than
the
arithmetic
in
georgetown
until
after
i
was
appointed
to
west
point
i
then
bought
a
work
on
algebra
in
cincinnati
but
having
no
teacher
it
was
greek
to
me
my
life
in
georgetown
was
uneventful
from
the
age
of
five
or
six
until
seventeen
i
attended
the
subscription
schools
of
the
village
except
during
the
winters
of
and
the
former
period
was
spent
in
maysville
kentucky
attending
the
school
of
richardson
and
rand
the
latter
in
ripley
ohio
at
a
private
school
i
was
not
studious
in
habit
and
probably
did
not
make
progress
enough
to
compensate
for
the
outlay
for
board
and
tuition
at
all
events
both
winters
were
spent
in
going
over
the
same
old
arithmetic
which
i
knew
every
word
of
before
and
repeating
a
noun
is
the
name
of
a
thing
which
i
had
also
heard
my
georgetown
teachers
repeat
until
i
had
come
to
believe
it
but
i
cast
no
reflections
upon
my
old
teacher
richardson
he
turned
out
bright
scholars
from
his
school
many
of
whom
have
filled
conspicuous
places
in
the
service
of
their
states
two
of
my
contemporaries
there
who
i
believe
never
attended
any
other
institution
of
learning
have
held
seats
in
congress
and
one
if
not
both
other
high
offices
these
are
wadsworth
and
brewster
my
father
was
from
my
earliest
recollection
in
comfortable
circumstances
considering
the
times
his
place
of
residence
and
the
community
in
which
he
lived
mindful
of
his
own
lack
of
facilities
for
acquiring
an
education
his
greatest
desire
in
maturer
years
was
for
the
education
of
his
children
consequently
as
stated
before
i
never
missed
a
quarter
from
school
from
the
time
i
was
old
enough
to
attend
till
the
time
of
leaving
home
this
did
not
exempt
me
from
labor
in
my
early
days
every
one
labored
more
or
less
in
the
region
where
my
youth
was
spent
and
more
in
proportion
to
their
private
means
it
was
only
the
very
poor
who
were
exempt
while
my
father
carried
on
the
manufacture
of
leather
and
worked
at
the
trade
himself
he
owned
and
tilled
considerable
land
i
detested
the
trade
preferring
almost
any
other
labor
but
i
was
fond
of
agriculture
and
of
all
employment
in
which
horses
were
used
we
had
among
other
lands
fifty
acres
of
forest
within
a
mile
of
the
village
in
the
fall
of
the
year
choppers
were
employed
to
cut
enough
wood
to
last
a
when
i
was
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
i
began
hauling
all
the
wood
used
in
the
house
and
shops
i
could
not
load
it
on
the
wagons
of
course
at
that
time
but
i
could
drive
and
the
choppers
would
load
and
some
one
at
the
house
unload
when
about
eleven
years
old
i
was
strong
enough
to
hold
a
plough
from
that
age
until
seventeen
i
did
all
the
work
done
with
horses
such
as
breaking
up
the
land
furrowing
ploughing
corn
and
potatoes
bringing
in
the
crops
when
harvested
hauling
all
the
wood
besides
tending
two
or
three
horses
a
cow
or
two
and
sawing
wood
for
stoves
while
still
attending
school
for
this
i
was
compensated
by
the
fact
that
there
was
never
any
scolding
or
punishing
by
my
parents
no
objection
to
rational
enjoyments
such
as
fishing
going
to
the
creek
a
mile
away
to
swim
in
summer
taking
a
horse
and
visiting
my
grandparents
in
the
adjoining
county
fifteen
miles
off
skating
on
the
ice
in
winter
or
taking
a
horse
and
sleigh
when
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
while
still
quite
young
i
had
visited
cincinnati
miles
away
several
times
alone
also
maysville
kentucky
often
and
once
louisville
the
journey
to
louisville
was
a
big
one
for
a
boy
of
that
day
i
had
also
gone
once
with
a
carriage
to
chilicothe
about
seventy
miles
with
a
neighbor
family
who
were
removing
to
toledo
ohio
and
returned
alone
and
had
gone
once
in
like
manner
to
flat
rock
kentucky
about
seventy
miles
away
on
this
latter
occasion
i
was
fifteen
years
of
age
while
at
flat
rock
at
the
house
of
a
payne
whom
i
was
visiting
with
his
brother
a
neighbor
of
ours
in
georgetown
i
saw
a
very
fine
saddle
horse
which
i
rather
coveted
and
proposed
to
payne
the
owner
to
trade
him
for
one
of
the
two
i
was
driving
payne
hesitated
to
trade
with
a
boy
but
asking
his
brother
about
it
the
latter
told
him
that
it
would
be
all
right
that
i
was
allowed
to
do
as
i
pleased
with
the
horses
i
was
seventy
miles
from
home
with
a
carriage
to
take
back
and
payne
said
he
did
not
know
that
his
horse
had
ever
had
a
collar
on
i
asked
to
have
him
hitched
to
a
farm
wagon
and
we
would
soon
see
whether
he
would
work
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
horse
had
never
worn
harness
before
but
he
showed
no
viciousness
and
i
expressed
a
confidence
that
i
could
manage
him
a
trade
was
at
once
struck
i
receiving
ten
dollars
difference
the
next
day
payne
of
georgetown
and
i
started
on
our
return
we
got
along
very
well
for
a
few
miles
when
we
encountered
a
ferocious
dog
that
frightened
the
horses
and
made
them
run
the
new
animal
kicked
at
every
jump
he
made
i
got
the
horses
stopped
however
before
any
damage
was
done
and
without
running
into
anything
after
giving
them
a
little
rest
to
quiet
their
fears
we
started
again
that
instant
the
new
horse
kicked
and
started
to
run
once
more
the
road
we
were
on
struck
the
turnpike
within
half
a
mile
of
the
point
where
the
second
runaway
commenced
and
there
there
was
an
embankment
twenty
or
more
feet
deep
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pike
i
got
the
horses
stopped
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
my
new
horse
was
terribly
frightened
and
trembled
like
an
aspen
but
he
was
not
half
so
badly
frightened
as
my
companion
payne
who
deserted
me
after
this
last
experience
and
took
passage
on
a
freight
wagon
for
maysville
every
time
i
attempted
to
start
my
new
horse
would
commence
to
kick
i
was
in
quite
a
dilemma
for
a
time
once
in
maysville
i
could
borrow
a
horse
from
an
uncle
who
lived
there
but
i
was
more
than
a
day
travel
from
that
point
finally
i
took
out
my
bandanna
the
style
of
handkerchief
in
universal
use
then
and
with
this
blindfolded
my
horse
in
this
way
i
reached
maysville
safely
the
next
day
no
doubt
much
to
the
surprise
of
my
friend
here
i
borrowed
a
horse
from
my
uncle
and
the
following
day
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
about
half
my
in
georgetown
were
spent
at
the
school
of
john
white
a
north
carolinian
and
the
father
of
chilton
white
who
represented
the
district
in
congress
for
one
term
during
the
rebellion
white
was
always
a
democrat
in
politics
and
chilton
followed
his
father
he
had
two
older
brothers
all
three
being
of
mine
at
their
father
school
who
did
not
go
the
same
way
the
second
brother
died
before
the
rebellion
began
he
was
a
whig
and
afterwards
a
republican
his
oldest
brother
was
a
republican
and
brave
soldier
during
the
rebellion
chilton
is
reported
as
having
told
of
an
earlier
of
mine
as
he
told
the
story
there
was
a
ralston
living
within
a
few
miles
of
the
village
who
owned
a
colt
which
i
very
much
wanted
my
father
had
offered
twenty
dollars
for
it
but
ralston
wanted
i
was
so
anxious
to
have
the
colt
that
after
the
owner
left
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
take
him
at
the
price
demanded
my
father
yielded
but
said
twenty
dollars
was
all
the
horse
was
worth
and
told
me
to
offer
that
price
if
it
was
not
accepted
i
was
to
offer
and
a
half
and
if
that
would
not
get
him
to
give
the
i
at
once
mounted
a
horse
and
went
for
the
colt
when
i
got
to
ralston
house
i
said
to
him
papa
says
i
may
offer
you
twenty
dollars
for
the
colt
but
if
you
wo
take
that
i
am
to
offer
and
a
half
and
if
you
wo
take
that
to
give
you
it
would
not
require
a
connecticut
man
to
guess
the
price
finally
agreed
upon
this
story
is
nearly
true
i
certainly
showed
very
plainly
that
i
had
come
for
the
colt
and
meant
to
have
him
i
could
not
have
been
over
eight
years
old
at
the
time
this
transaction
caused
me
great
the
story
got
out
among
the
boys
of
the
village
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
heard
the
last
of
it
boys
enjoy
the
misery
of
their
companions
at
least
village
boys
in
that
day
did
and
in
later
life
i
have
found
that
all
adults
are
not
free
from
the
peculiarity
i
kept
the
horse
until
he
was
four
years
old
when
he
went
blind
and
i
sold
him
for
twenty
dollars
when
i
went
to
maysville
to
school
in
at
the
age
of
fourteen
i
recognized
my
colt
as
one
of
the
blind
horses
working
on
the
of
the
i
have
describes
enough
of
my
early
life
to
give
an
impression
of
the
whole
i
did
not
like
to
work
but
i
did
as
much
of
it
while
young
as
grown
men
can
be
hired
to
do
in
these
days
and
attended
school
at
the
same
time
i
had
as
many
privileges
as
any
boy
in
the
village
and
probably
more
than
most
of
them
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
having
been
punished
at
home
either
by
scolding
or
by
the
rod
but
at
school
the
case
was
different
the
rod
was
freely
used
there
and
i
was
not
exempt
from
its
influence
i
can
see
john
white
the
school
teacher
now
with
his
long
beech
switch
always
in
his
hand
it
was
not
always
the
same
one
either
switches
were
brought
in
bundles
from
a
beech
wood
near
the
school
house
by
the
boys
for
whose
benefit
they
were
intended
often
a
whole
bundle
would
be
used
up
in
a
single
day
i
never
had
any
hard
feelings
against
my
teacher
either
while
attending
the
school
or
in
later
years
when
reflecting
upon
my
experience
white
was
a
kindhearted
man
and
was
much
respected
by
the
community
in
which
he
lived
he
only
followed
the
universal
custom
of
the
period
and
that
under
which
he
had
received
his
own
education
chapter
ii
west
point
graduation
in
the
winter
of
i
was
attending
school
at
ripley
only
ten
miles
distant
from
georgetown
but
spent
the
christmas
holidays
at
home
during
this
vacation
my
father
received
a
letter
from
the
honorable
thomas
morris
then
united
states
senator
from
ohio
when
he
read
it
he
said
to
me
ulysses
i
believe
you
are
going
to
receive
the
appointment
what
appointment
i
inquired
to
west
point
i
have
applied
for
it
but
i
wo
go
i
said
he
said
he
thought
i
would
and
i
thought
so
too
if
he
did
i
really
had
no
objection
to
going
to
west
point
except
that
i
had
a
very
exalted
idea
of
the
acquirements
necessary
to
get
through
i
did
not
believe
i
possessed
them
and
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
failing
there
had
been
four
boys
from
our
village
or
its
immediate
neighborhood
who
had
been
graduated
from
west
point
and
never
a
failure
of
any
one
appointed
from
georgetown
except
in
the
case
of
the
one
whose
place
i
was
to
take
he
was
the
son
of
bailey
our
nearest
and
most
intimate
neighbor
young
bailey
had
been
appointed
in
finding
before
the
january
examination
following
that
he
could
not
pass
he
resigned
and
went
to
a
private
school
and
remained
there
until
the
following
year
when
he
was
reappointed
before
the
next
examination
he
was
dismissed
bailey
was
a
proud
and
sensitive
man
and
felt
the
failure
of
his
son
so
keenly
that
he
forbade
his
return
home
there
were
no
telegraphs
in
those
days
to
disseminate
news
rapidly
no
railroads
west
of
the
alleghanies
and
but
few
east
and
above
all
there
were
no
reporters
prying
into
other
people
private
affairs
consequently
it
did
not
become
generally
known
that
there
was
a
vacancy
at
west
point
from
our
district
until
i
was
appointed
i
presume
bailey
confided
to
my
mother
the
fact
that
bartlett
had
been
dismissed
and
that
the
doctor
had
forbidden
his
son
return
home
the
honorable
thomas
hamer
one
of
the
ablest
men
ohio
ever
produced
was
our
member
of
congress
at
the
time
and
had
the
right
of
nomination
he
and
my
father
had
been
members
of
the
same
debating
society
where
they
were
generally
pitted
on
opposite
sides
and
intimate
personal
friends
from
their
early
manhood
up
to
a
few
years
before
in
politics
they
differed
hamer
was
a
democrat
while
my
father
was
a
whig
they
had
a
warm
discussion
which
finally
became
angry
over
some
act
of
president
jackson
the
removal
of
the
deposit
of
public
moneys
i
think
after
which
they
never
spoke
until
after
my
appointment
i
know
both
of
them
felt
badly
over
this
estrangement
and
would
have
been
glad
at
any
time
to
come
to
a
reconciliation
but
neither
would
make
the
advance
under
these
circumstances
my
father
would
not
write
to
hamer
for
the
appointment
but
he
wrote
to
thomas
morris
united
states
senator
from
ohio
informing
him
that
there
was
a
vacancy
at
west
point
from
our
district
and
that
he
would
be
glad
if
i
could
be
appointed
to
fill
it
this
letter
i
presume
was
turned
over
to
hamer
and
as
there
was
no
other
applicant
he
cheerfully
appointed
me
this
healed
the
breach
between
the
two
never
after
reopened
besides
the
argument
used
by
my
father
in
favor
of
my
going
to
west
point
that
he
thought
i
would
go
there
was
another
very
strong
inducement
i
had
always
a
great
desire
to
travel
i
was
already
the
best
travelled
boy
in
georgetown
except
the
sons
of
one
man
john
walker
who
had
emigrated
to
texas
with
his
family
and
immigrated
back
as
soon
as
he
could
get
the
means
to
do
so
in
his
short
stay
in
texas
he
acquired
a
very
different
opinion
of
the
country
from
what
one
would
form
going
there
now
i
had
been
east
to
wheeling
virginia
and
north
to
the
western
reserve
in
ohio
west
to
louisville
and
south
to
bourbon
county
kentucky
besides
having
driven
or
ridden
pretty
much
over
the
whole
country
within
fifty
miles
of
home
going
to
west
point
would
give
me
the
opportunity
of
visiting
the
two
great
cities
of
the
continent
philadelphia
and
new
york
this
was
enough
when
these
places
were
visited
i
would
have
been
glad
to
have
had
a
steamboat
or
railroad
collision
or
any
other
accident
happen
by
which
i
might
have
received
a
temporary
injury
sufficient
to
make
me
ineligible
for
a
time
to
enter
the
academy
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
and
i
had
to
face
the
music
georgetown
has
a
remarkable
record
for
a
western
village
it
is
and
has
been
from
its
earliest
existence
a
democratic
town
there
was
probably
no
time
during
the
rebellion
when
if
the
opportunity
could
have
been
afforded
it
would
not
have
voted
for
jefferson
davis
for
president
of
the
united
states
over
lincoln
or
any
other
representative
of
his
party
unless
it
was
immediately
after
some
of
john
morgan
men
in
his
celebrated
raid
through
ohio
spent
a
few
hours
in
the
village
the
rebels
helped
themselves
to
whatever
they
could
find
horses
boots
and
shoes
especially
horses
and
many
ordered
meals
to
be
prepared
for
them
by
the
families
this
was
no
doubt
a
far
pleasanter
duty
for
some
families
than
it
would
have
been
to
render
a
like
service
for
union
soldiers
the
line
between
the
rebel
and
union
element
in
georgetown
was
so
marked
that
it
led
to
divisions
even
in
the
churches
there
were
churches
in
that
part
of
ohio
where
treason
was
preached
regularly
and
where
to
secure
membership
hostility
to
the
government
to
the
war
and
to
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
was
far
more
essential
than
a
belief
in
the
authenticity
or
credibility
of
the
bible
there
were
men
in
georgetown
who
filled
all
the
requirements
for
membership
in
these
churches
yet
this
western
village
with
a
population
including
old
and
young
male
and
female
of
about
one
thousand
about
enough
for
the
organization
of
a
single
regiment
if
all
had
been
men
capable
of
bearing
arms
furnished
the
union
army
four
general
officers
and
one
colonel
west
point
graduates
and
nine
generals
and
field
officers
of
volunteers
that
i
can
think
of
of
the
graduates
from
west
point
all
had
citizenship
elsewhere
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
rebellion
except
possibly
general
kautz
who
had
remained
in
the
army
from
his
graduation
two
of
the
colonels
also
entered
the
service
from
other
localities
the
other
seven
general
mcgroierty
colonels
white
fyffe
loudon
and
marshall
majors
king
and
bailey
were
all
residents
of
georgetown
when
the
war
broke
out
and
all
of
them
who
were
alive
at
the
close
returned
there
major
bailey
was
the
cadet
who
had
preceded
me
at
west
point
he
was
killed
in
west
virginia
in
his
first
engagement
as
far
as
i
know
every
boy
who
has
entered
west
point
from
that
village
since
my
time
has
been
graduated
i
took
passage
on
a
steamer
at
ripley
ohio
for
pittsburg
about
the
middle
of
may
western
boats
at
that
day
did
not
make
regular
trips
at
stated
times
but
would
stop
anywhere
and
for
any
length
of
time
for
passengers
or
freight
i
have
myself
been
detained
two
or
three
days
at
a
place
after
steam
was
up
the
gang
planks
all
but
one
drawn
in
and
after
the
time
advertised
for
starting
had
expired
on
this
occasion
we
had
no
vexatious
delays
and
in
about
three
days
pittsburg
was
reached
from
pittsburg
i
chose
passage
by
the
canal
to
harrisburg
rather
than
by
the
more
expeditious
stage
this
gave
a
better
opportunity
of
enjoying
the
fine
scenery
of
western
pennsylvania
and
i
had
rather
a
dread
of
reaching
my
destination
at
all
at
that
time
the
canal
was
much
patronized
by
travellers
and
with
the
comfortable
packets
of
the
period
no
mode
of
conveyance
could
be
more
pleasant
when
time
was
not
an
object
from
harrisburg
to
philadelphia
there
was
a
railroad
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
except
the
one
on
which
i
had
just
crossed
the
summit
of
the
alleghany
mountains
and
over
which
canal
boats
were
transported
in
travelling
by
the
road
from
harrisburg
i
thought
the
perfection
of
rapid
transit
had
been
reached
we
travelled
at
least
eighteen
miles
an
hour
when
at
full
speed
and
made
the
whole
distance
averaging
probably
as
much
as
twelve
miles
an
hour
this
seemed
like
annihilating
space
i
stopped
five
days
in
philadelphia
saw
about
every
street
in
the
city
attended
the
theatre
visited
girard
college
which
was
then
in
course
of
construction
and
got
reprimanded
from
home
afterwards
for
dallying
by
the
way
so
long
my
sojourn
in
new
york
was
shorter
but
long
enough
to
enable
me
to
see
the
city
very
well
i
reported
at
west
point
on
the
or
of
may
and
about
two
weeks
later
passed
my
examination
for
admission
without
difficulty
very
much
to
my
surprise
a
military
life
had
no
charms
for
me
and
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
staying
in
the
army
even
if
i
should
be
graduated
which
i
did
not
expect
the
encampment
which
preceded
the
commencement
of
academic
studies
was
very
wearisome
and
uninteresting
when
the
of
august
came
the
date
for
breaking
up
camp
and
going
into
barracks
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
at
west
point
always
and
that
if
i
staid
to
graduation
i
would
have
to
remain
always
i
did
not
take
hold
of
my
studies
with
avidity
in
fact
i
rarely
ever
read
over
a
lesson
the
second
time
during
my
entire
cadetship
i
could
not
sit
in
my
room
doing
nothing
there
is
a
fine
library
connected
with
the
academy
from
which
cadets
can
get
books
to
read
in
their
quarters
i
devoted
more
time
to
these
than
to
books
relating
to
the
course
of
studies
much
of
the
time
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
devoted
to
novels
but
not
those
of
a
trashy
sort
i
read
all
of
bulwer
then
published
cooper
marryat
scott
washington
irving
works
lever
and
many
others
that
i
do
not
now
remember
mathematics
was
very
easy
to
me
so
that
when
january
came
i
passed
the
examination
taking
a
good
standing
in
that
branch
in
french
the
only
other
study
at
that
time
in
the
first
year
course
my
standing
was
very
low
in
fact
if
the
class
had
been
turned
the
other
end
foremost
i
should
have
been
near
head
i
never
succeeded
in
getting
squarely
at
either
end
of
my
class
in
any
one
study
during
the
four
years
i
came
near
it
in
french
artillery
infantry
and
cavalry
tactics
and
conduct
early
in
the
session
of
the
congress
which
met
in
december
a
bill
was
discussed
abolishing
the
military
academy
i
saw
in
this
an
honorable
way
to
obtain
a
discharge
and
read
the
debates
with
much
interest
but
with
impatience
at
the
delay
in
taking
action
for
i
was
selfish
enough
to
favor
the
bill
it
never
passed
and
a
year
later
although
the
time
hung
drearily
with
me
i
would
have
been
sorry
to
have
seen
it
succeed
my
idea
then
was
to
get
through
the
course
secure
a
detail
for
a
few
years
as
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
academy
and
afterwards
obtain
a
permanent
position
as
professor
in
some
respectable
college
but
circumstances
always
did
shape
my
course
different
from
my
plans
at
the
end
of
two
years
the
class
received
the
usual
furlough
extending
from
the
close
of
the
june
examination
to
the
of
august
this
i
enjoyed
beyond
any
other
period
of
my
life
my
father
had
sold
out
his
business
in
georgetown
where
my
youth
had
been
spent
and
to
which
my
carried
me
back
as
my
future
home
if
i
should
ever
be
able
to
retire
on
a
competency
he
had
moved
to
bethel
only
twelve
miles
away
in
the
adjoining
county
of
clermont
and
had
bought
a
young
horse
that
had
never
been
in
harness
for
my
special
use
under
the
saddle
during
my
furlough
most
of
my
time
was
spent
among
my
old
these
ten
weeks
were
shorter
than
one
week
at
west
point
persons
acquainted
with
the
academy
know
that
the
corps
of
cadets
is
divided
into
four
companies
for
the
purpose
of
military
exercises
these
companies
are
officered
from
the
cadets
the
superintendent
and
commandant
selecting
the
officers
for
their
military
bearing
and
qualifications
the
adjutant
quartermaster
four
captains
and
twelve
lieutenants
are
taken
from
the
first
or
senior
class
the
sergeants
from
the
second
or
junior
class
and
the
corporals
from
the
third
or
sophomore
class
i
had
not
been
called
out
as
a
corporal
but
when
i
returned
from
furlough
i
found
myself
the
last
but
one
about
my
standing
in
all
the
tactics
of
eighteen
sergeants
the
promotion
was
too
much
for
me
that
year
my
standing
in
the
class
as
shown
by
the
number
of
demerits
of
the
year
was
about
the
same
as
it
was
among
the
sergeants
and
i
was
dropped
and
served
the
fourth
year
as
a
private
during
my
first
year
encampment
general
scott
visited
west
point
and
reviewed
the
cadets
with
his
commanding
figure
his
quite
colossal
size
and
showy
uniform
i
thought
him
the
finest
specimen
of
manhood
my
eyes
had
ever
beheld
and
the
most
to
be
envied
i
could
never
resemble
him
in
appearance
but
i
believe
i
did
have
a
presentiment
for
a
moment
that
some
day
i
should
occupy
his
place
on
review
although
i
had
no
intention
then
of
remaining
in
the
army
my
experience
in
a
ten
years
before
and
the
ridicule
it
caused
me
were
too
fresh
in
my
mind
for
me
to
communicate
this
presentiment
to
even
my
most
intimate
chum
the
next
summer
martin
van
buren
then
president
of
the
united
states
visited
west
point
and
reviewed
the
cadets
he
did
not
impress
me
with
the
awe
which
scott
had
inspired
in
fact
i
regarded
general
scott
and
captain
smith
the
commandant
of
cadets
as
the
two
men
most
to
be
envied
in
the
nation
i
retained
a
high
regard
for
both
up
to
the
day
of
their
death
the
last
two
years
wore
away
more
rapidly
than
the
first
two
but
they
still
seemed
about
five
times
as
long
as
ohio
years
to
me
at
last
all
the
examinations
were
passed
and
the
members
of
the
class
were
called
upon
to
record
their
choice
of
arms
of
service
and
regiments
i
was
anxious
to
enter
the
cavalry
or
dragoons
as
they
were
then
called
but
there
was
only
one
regiment
of
dragoons
in
the
army
at
that
time
and
attached
to
that
besides
the
full
complement
of
officers
there
were
at
least
four
brevet
second
lieutenants
i
recorded
therefore
my
first
choice
dragoons
second
infantry
and
got
the
latter
again
there
was
a
furlough
or
more
properly
speaking
leave
of
absence
for
the
class
were
now
commissioned
officers
this
time
to
the
end
of
september
again
i
went
to
ohio
to
spend
my
vacation
among
my
old
and
again
i
found
a
fine
saddle
horse
purchased
for
my
special
use
besides
a
horse
and
buggy
that
i
could
drive
but
i
was
not
in
a
physical
condition
to
enjoy
myself
quite
as
well
as
on
the
former
occasion
for
six
months
before
graduation
i
had
had
a
desperate
cough
tyler
grip
it
was
called
and
i
was
very
much
reduced
weighing
but
one
hundred
and
seventeen
pounds
just
my
weight
at
entrance
though
i
had
grown
six
inches
in
stature
in
the
mean
time
there
was
consumption
in
my
father
family
two
of
his
brothers
having
died
of
that
disease
which
made
my
symptoms
more
alarming
the
brother
and
sister
next
younger
than
myself
died
during
the
rebellion
of
the
same
disease
and
i
seemed
the
most
promising
subject
for
it
of
the
three
in
having
made
alternate
choice
of
two
different
arms
of
service
with
different
uniforms
i
could
not
get
a
uniform
suit
until
notified
of
my
assignment
i
left
my
measurement
with
a
tailor
with
directions
not
to
make
the
uniform
until
i
notified
him
whether
it
was
to
be
for
infantry
or
dragoons
notice
did
not
reach
me
for
several
weeks
and
then
it
took
at
least
a
week
to
get
the
letter
of
instructions
to
the
tailor
and
two
more
to
make
the
clothes
and
have
them
sent
to
me
this
was
a
time
of
great
suspense
i
was
impatient
to
get
on
my
uniform
and
see
how
it
looked
and
probably
wanted
my
old
particularly
the
girls
to
see
me
in
it
the
conceit
was
knocked
out
of
me
by
two
little
circumstances
that
happened
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
clothes
which
gave
me
a
distaste
for
military
uniform
that
i
never
recovered
from
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
suit
i
donned
it
and
put
off
for
cincinnati
on
horseback
while
i
was
riding
along
a
street
of
that
city
imagining
that
every
one
was
looking
at
me
with
a
feeling
akin
to
mine
when
i
first
saw
general
scott
a
little
urchin
bareheaded
footed
with
dirty
and
ragged
pants
held
up
by
bare
a
single
gallows
that
what
suspenders
were
called
then
and
a
shirt
that
had
not
seen
a
for
weeks
turned
to
me
and
cried
soldier
will
you
work
no
sir
ee
i
sell
my
shirt
first
the
horse
trade
and
its
dire
consequences
were
recalled
to
mind
the
other
circumstance
occurred
at
home
opposite
our
house
in
bethel
stood
the
old
stage
tavern
where
man
and
beast
found
accommodation
the
was
rather
dissipated
but
possessed
of
some
humor
on
my
return
i
found
him
parading
the
streets
and
attending
in
the
stable
barefooted
but
in
a
pair
of
nankeen
pantaloons
just
the
color
of
my
uniform
trousers
with
a
strip
of
white
cotton
sheeting
sewed
down
the
outside
seams
in
imitation
of
mine
the
joke
was
a
huge
one
in
the
mind
of
many
of
the
people
and
was
much
enjoyed
by
them
but
i
did
not
appreciate
it
so
highly
during
the
remainder
of
my
leave
of
absence
my
time
was
spent
in
visiting
friends
in
georgetown
and
cincinnati
and
occasionally
other
towns
in
that
part
of
the
state
chapter
iii
army
life
causes
of
the
mexican
war
camp
salubrity
on
the
of
september
i
reported
for
duty
at
jefferson
barracks
louis
with
the
united
states
infantry
it
was
the
largest
military
post
in
the
country
at
that
time
being
garrisoned
by
sixteen
companies
of
infantry
eight
of
the
regiment
the
remainder
of
the
colonel
steven
kearney
one
of
the
ablest
officers
of
the
day
commanded
the
post
and
under
him
discipline
was
kept
at
a
high
standard
but
without
vexatious
rules
or
regulations
every
drill
and
had
to
be
attended
but
in
the
intervals
officers
were
permitted
to
enjoy
themselves
leaving
the
garrison
and
going
where
they
pleased
without
making
written
application
to
state
where
they
were
going
for
how
long
so
that
they
were
back
for
their
next
duty
it
did
seem
to
me
in
my
early
army
days
that
too
many
of
the
older
officers
when
they
came
to
command
posts
made
it
a
study
to
think
what
orders
they
could
publish
to
annoy
their
subordinates
and
render
them
uncomfortable
i
noticed
however
a
few
years
later
when
the
mexican
war
broke
out
that
most
of
this
class
of
officers
discovered
they
were
possessed
of
disabilities
which
entirely
incapacitated
them
for
active
field
service
they
had
the
moral
courage
to
proclaim
it
too
they
were
right
but
they
did
not
always
give
their
disease
the
right
name
at
west
point
i
had
a
in
the
last
year
of
our
studies
he
was
also
dent
whose
family
resided
some
five
miles
west
of
jefferson
barracks
two
of
his
unmarried
brothers
were
living
at
home
at
that
time
and
as
i
had
taken
with
me
from
ohio
my
horse
saddle
and
bridle
i
soon
found
my
way
out
to
white
haven
the
name
of
the
dent
estate
as
i
found
the
family
congenial
my
visits
became
frequent
there
were
at
home
besides
the
young
men
two
daughters
one
a
school
miss
of
fifteen
the
other
a
girl
of
eight
or
nine
there
was
still
an
older
daughter
of
seventeen
who
had
been
spending
several
years
at
in
louis
but
who
though
through
school
had
not
yet
returned
home
she
was
spending
the
winter
in
the
city
with
connections
the
family
of
colonel
john
well
known
in
louis
in
february
she
returned
to
her
country
home
after
that
i
do
not
know
but
my
visits
became
more
frequent
they
certainly
did
become
more
enjoyable
we
would
often
take
walks
or
go
on
horseback
to
visit
the
neighbors
until
i
became
quite
well
acquainted
in
that
vicinity
sometimes
one
of
the
brothers
would
accompany
us
sometimes
one
of
the
younger
sisters
if
the
infantry
had
remained
at
jefferson
barracks
it
is
possible
even
probable
that
this
life
might
have
continued
for
some
years
without
my
finding
out
that
there
was
anything
serious
the
matter
with
me
but
in
the
following
may
a
circumstance
occurred
which
developed
my
sentiment
so
palpably
that
there
was
no
mistaking
it
the
annexation
of
texas
was
at
this
time
the
subject
of
violent
discussion
in
congress
in
the
press
and
by
individuals
the
administration
of
president
tyler
then
in
power
was
making
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
effect
the
annexation
which
was
indeed
the
great
and
absorbing
question
of
the
day
during
these
discussions
the
greater
part
of
the
single
rifle
regiment
in
the
army
the
dragoons
which
had
been
dismounted
a
year
or
two
before
and
designated
dismounted
rifles
was
stationed
at
fort
jessup
louisiana
some
miles
east
of
the
texas
line
to
observe
the
frontier
about
the
of
may
the
infantry
was
ordered
from
jefferson
barracks
to
louisiana
to
go
into
camp
in
the
neighborhood
of
fort
jessup
and
there
await
further
orders
the
troops
were
embarked
on
steamers
and
were
on
their
way
down
the
mississippi
within
a
few
days
after
the
receipt
of
this
order
about
the
time
they
started
i
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
for
twenty
days
to
go
to
ohio
to
visit
my
parents
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
louis
to
take
a
steamer
for
louisville
or
cincinnati
or
the
first
steamer
going
up
the
ohio
river
to
any
point
before
i
left
louis
orders
were
received
at
jefferson
barracks
for
the
infantry
to
follow
the
a
messenger
was
sent
after
me
to
stop
my
leaving
but
before
he
could
reach
me
i
was
off
totally
ignorant
of
these
events
a
day
or
two
after
my
arrival
at
bethel
i
received
a
letter
from
a
classmate
and
fellow
lieutenant
in
the
informing
me
of
the
circumstances
related
above
and
advising
me
not
to
open
any
letter
post
marked
louis
or
jefferson
barracks
until
the
expiration
of
my
leave
and
saying
that
he
would
pack
up
my
things
and
take
them
along
for
me
his
advice
was
not
necessary
for
no
other
letter
was
sent
to
me
i
now
discovered
that
i
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
get
back
to
jefferson
barracks
and
i
understood
the
reason
without
explanation
from
any
one
my
leave
of
absence
required
me
to
report
for
duty
at
jefferson
barracks
at
the
end
of
twenty
days
i
knew
my
regiment
had
gone
up
the
red
river
but
i
was
not
disposed
to
break
the
letter
of
my
leave
besides
if
i
had
proceeded
to
louisiana
direct
i
could
not
have
reached
there
until
after
the
expiration
of
my
leave
accordingly
at
the
end
of
the
twenty
days
i
reported
for
duty
to
lieutenant
ewell
commanding
at
jefferson
barracks
handing
him
at
the
same
time
my
leave
of
absence
after
noticing
the
phraseology
of
the
order
leaves
of
absence
were
generally
worded
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
will
report
for
duty
with
his
proper
command
he
said
he
would
give
me
an
order
to
join
my
regiment
in
louisiana
i
then
asked
for
a
few
days
leave
before
starting
which
he
readily
granted
this
was
the
same
ewell
who
acquired
considerable
reputation
as
a
confederate
general
during
the
rebellion
he
was
a
man
much
esteemed
and
deservedly
so
in
the
old
army
and
proved
himself
a
gallant
and
efficient
officer
in
two
wars
both
in
my
estimation
unholy
i
immediately
procured
a
horse
and
started
for
the
country
taking
no
baggage
with
me
of
course
there
is
an
insignificant
creek
the
gravois
between
jefferson
barracks
and
the
place
to
which
i
was
going
and
at
that
day
there
was
not
a
bridge
over
it
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
there
is
not
water
enough
in
the
creek
at
ordinary
stages
to
run
a
coffee
mill
and
at
low
water
there
is
none
running
whatever
on
this
occasion
it
had
been
raining
heavily
and
when
the
creek
was
reached
i
found
the
banks
full
to
overflowing
and
the
current
rapid
i
looked
at
it
a
moment
to
consider
what
to
do
one
of
my
superstitions
had
always
been
when
i
started
to
go
any
where
or
to
do
anything
not
to
turn
back
or
stop
until
the
thing
intended
was
accomplished
i
have
frequently
started
to
go
to
places
where
i
had
never
been
and
to
which
i
did
not
know
the
way
depending
upon
making
inquiries
on
the
road
and
if
i
got
past
the
place
without
knowing
it
instead
of
turning
back
i
would
go
on
until
a
road
was
found
turning
in
the
right
direction
take
that
and
come
in
by
the
other
side
so
i
struck
into
the
stream
and
in
an
instant
the
horse
was
swimming
and
i
being
carried
down
by
the
current
i
headed
the
horse
towards
the
other
bank
and
soon
reached
it
wet
through
and
without
other
clothes
on
that
side
of
the
stream
i
went
on
however
to
my
destination
and
borrowed
a
dry
suit
from
my
future
we
were
not
of
the
same
size
but
the
clothes
answered
every
purpose
until
i
got
more
of
my
own
before
i
returned
i
mustered
up
courage
to
make
known
in
the
most
awkward
manner
imaginable
the
discovery
i
had
made
on
learning
that
the
infantry
had
been
ordered
away
from
jefferson
barracks
the
young
lady
afterwards
admitted
that
she
too
although
until
then
she
had
never
looked
upon
me
other
than
as
a
visitor
whose
company
was
agreeable
to
her
had
experienced
a
depression
of
spirits
she
could
not
account
for
when
the
regiment
left
before
separating
it
was
definitely
understood
that
at
a
convenient
time
we
would
join
our
fortunes
and
not
let
the
removal
of
a
regiment
trouble
us
this
was
in
may
it
was
the
of
august
before
the
fulfilment
of
this
agreement
my
duties
kept
me
on
the
frontier
of
louisiana
with
the
army
of
observation
during
the
pendency
of
annexation
and
afterwards
i
was
absent
through
the
war
with
mexico
provoked
by
the
action
of
the
army
if
not
by
the
annexation
itself
during
that
time
there
was
a
constant
correspondence
between
miss
dent
and
myself
but
we
only
met
once
in
the
period
of
four
years
and
three
months
in
may
i
procured
a
leave
for
twenty
days
visited
louis
and
obtained
the
consent
of
the
parents
for
the
union
which
had
not
been
asked
for
before
as
already
stated
it
was
never
my
intention
to
remain
in
the
army
long
but
to
prepare
myself
for
a
professorship
in
some
college
accordingly
soon
after
i
was
settled
at
jefferson
barracks
i
wrote
a
letter
to
professor
church
professor
of
mathematics
at
west
point
requesting
him
to
ask
my
designation
as
his
assistant
when
next
a
detail
had
to
be
made
assistant
professors
at
west
point
are
all
officers
of
the
army
supposed
to
be
selected
for
their
special
fitness
for
the
particular
branch
of
study
they
are
assigned
to
teach
the
answer
from
professor
church
was
entirely
satisfactory
and
no
doubt
i
should
have
been
detailed
a
year
or
two
later
but
for
the
mexican
war
coming
on
accordingly
i
laid
out
for
myself
a
course
of
studies
to
be
pursued
in
garrison
with
regularity
if
not
persistency
i
reviewed
my
west
point
course
of
mathematics
during
the
seven
months
at
jefferson
barracks
and
read
many
valuable
historical
works
besides
an
occasional
novel
to
help
my
memory
i
kept
a
book
in
which
i
would
write
up
from
time
to
time
my
recollections
of
all
i
had
read
since
last
posting
it
when
the
regiment
was
ordered
away
i
being
absent
at
the
time
my
effects
were
packed
up
by
lieutenant
haslett
of
the
infantry
and
taken
along
i
never
saw
my
journal
after
nor
did
i
ever
keep
another
except
for
a
portion
of
the
time
while
travelling
abroad
often
since
a
fear
has
crossed
my
mind
lest
that
book
might
turn
up
yet
and
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
malicious
person
who
would
publish
it
i
know
its
appearance
would
cause
me
as
much
as
my
youthful
or
the
later
rebuke
for
wearing
uniform
clothes
the
infantry
had
selected
camping
grounds
on
the
reservation
at
fort
jessup
about
midway
between
the
red
river
and
the
sabine
our
orders
required
us
to
go
into
camp
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
await
further
instructions
those
authorized
to
do
so
selected
a
place
in
the
pine
woods
between
the
old
town
of
natchitoches
and
grand
ecore
about
three
miles
from
each
and
on
high
ground
back
from
the
river
the
place
was
given
the
name
of
camp
salubrity
and
proved
entitled
to
it
the
camp
was
on
a
high
sandy
pine
ridge
with
spring
branches
in
the
valley
in
front
and
rear
the
springs
furnished
an
abundance
of
cool
pure
water
and
the
ridge
was
above
the
flight
of
mosquitoes
which
abound
in
that
region
in
great
multitudes
and
of
great
voracity
in
the
valley
they
swarmed
in
myriads
but
never
came
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
the
regiment
occupied
this
camp
six
months
before
the
first
death
occurred
and
that
was
caused
by
an
accident
there
was
no
intimation
given
that
the
removal
of
the
and
regiments
of
infantry
to
the
western
border
of
louisiana
was
occasioned
in
any
way
by
the
prospective
annexation
of
texas
but
it
was
generally
understood
that
such
was
the
case
ostensibly
we
were
intended
to
prevent
filibustering
into
texas
but
really
as
a
menace
to
mexico
in
case
she
appeared
to
contemplate
war
generally
the
officers
of
the
army
were
indifferent
whether
the
annexation
was
consummated
or
not
but
not
so
all
of
them
for
myself
i
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
measure
and
to
this
day
regard
the
war
which
resulted
as
one
of
the
most
unjust
ever
waged
by
a
stronger
against
a
weaker
nation
it
was
an
instance
of
a
republic
following
the
bad
example
of
european
monarchies
in
not
considering
justice
in
their
desire
to
acquire
additional
territory
texas
was
originally
a
state
belonging
to
the
republic
of
mexico
it
extended
from
the
sabine
river
on
the
east
to
the
rio
grande
on
the
west
and
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
the
south
and
east
to
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
new
mexico
another
mexican
state
at
that
time
on
the
north
and
west
an
empire
in
territory
it
had
but
a
very
sparse
population
until
settled
by
americans
who
had
received
authority
from
mexico
to
colonize
these
colonists
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
supreme
government
and
introduced
slavery
into
the
state
almost
from
the
start
though
the
constitution
of
mexico
did
not
nor
does
it
now
sanction
that
institution
soon
they
set
up
an
independent
government
of
their
own
and
war
existed
between
texas
and
mexico
in
name
from
that
time
until
when
active
hostilities
very
nearly
ceased
upon
the
capture
of
santa
anna
the
mexican
president
before
long
however
the
same
people
who
with
permission
of
mexico
had
colonized
texas
and
afterwards
set
up
slavery
there
and
then
seceded
as
soon
as
they
felt
strong
enough
to
do
so
offered
themselves
and
the
state
to
the
united
states
and
in
their
offer
was
accepted
the
occupation
separation
and
annexation
were
from
the
inception
of
the
movement
to
its
final
consummation
a
conspiracy
to
acquire
territory
out
of
which
slave
states
might
be
formed
for
the
american
union
even
if
the
annexation
itself
could
be
justified
the
manner
in
which
the
subsequent
war
was
forced
upon
mexico
can
not
the
fact
is
annexationists
wanted
more
territory
than
they
could
possibly
lay
any
claim
to
as
part
of
the
new
acquisition
texas
as
an
independent
state
never
had
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
territory
between
the
nueces
river
and
the
rio
grande
mexico
had
never
recognized
the
independence
of
texas
and
maintained
that
even
if
independent
the
state
had
no
claim
south
of
the
nueces
i
am
aware
that
a
treaty
made
by
the
texans
with
santa
anna
while
he
was
under
duress
ceded
all
the
territory
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
but
he
was
a
prisoner
of
war
when
the
treaty
was
made
and
his
life
was
in
jeopardy
he
knew
too
that
he
deserved
execution
at
the
hands
of
the
texans
if
they
should
ever
capture
him
the
texans
if
they
had
taken
his
life
would
have
only
followed
the
example
set
by
santa
anna
himself
a
few
years
before
when
he
executed
the
entire
garrison
of
the
alamo
and
the
villagers
of
goliad
in
taking
military
possession
of
texas
after
annexation
the
army
of
occupation
under
general
taylor
was
directed
to
occupy
the
disputed
territory
the
army
did
not
stop
at
the
nueces
and
offer
to
negotiate
for
a
settlement
of
the
boundary
question
but
went
beyond
apparently
in
order
to
force
mexico
to
initiate
war
it
is
to
the
credit
of
the
american
nation
however
that
after
conquering
mexico
and
while
practically
holding
the
country
in
our
possession
so
that
we
could
have
retained
the
whole
of
it
or
made
any
terms
we
chose
we
paid
a
round
sum
for
the
additional
territory
taken
more
than
it
was
worth
or
was
likely
to
be
to
mexico
to
us
it
was
an
empire
and
of
incalculable
value
but
it
might
have
been
obtained
by
other
means
the
southern
rebellion
was
largely
the
outgrowth
of
the
mexican
war
nations
like
individuals
are
punished
for
their
transgressions
we
got
our
punishment
in
the
most
sanguinary
and
expensive
war
of
modern
times
the
infantry
went
into
camp
at
salubrity
in
the
month
of
may
with
instructions
as
i
have
said
to
await
further
orders
at
first
officers
and
men
occupied
ordinary
tents
as
the
summer
heat
increased
these
were
covered
by
sheds
to
break
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
summer
was
whiled
away
in
social
enjoyments
among
the
officers
in
visiting
those
stationed
at
and
near
fort
jessup
miles
away
visiting
the
planters
on
the
red
river
and
the
citizens
of
natchitoches
and
grand
ecore
there
was
much
pleasant
intercourse
between
the
inhabitants
and
the
officers
of
the
army
i
retain
very
agreeable
recollections
of
my
stay
at
camp
salubrity
and
of
the
acquaintances
made
there
and
no
doubt
my
feeling
is
shared
by
the
few
officers
living
who
were
there
at
the
time
i
can
call
to
mind
only
two
officers
of
the
infantry
besides
myself
who
were
at
camp
salubrity
with
the
regiment
who
are
now
alive
with
a
war
in
prospect
and
belonging
to
a
regiment
that
had
an
unusual
number
of
officers
detailed
on
special
duty
away
from
the
regiment
my
hopes
of
being
ordered
to
west
point
as
instructor
vanished
at
the
time
of
which
i
now

officers

were
appointed
from
the

of
the

and
did
not
vacate
their
regimental
commissions
until
their
regimental
and
staff
commissions
were
for
the
same
grades
generally
lieutenants
were
appointed
to
captaincies
to

vacancies
in

if
they
should
reach
a

in

before
they

at

in

they
would
elect
which
commission
they
would
retain
in
the

in
at
least
six
line
officers
were
on
duty
in
the
staff
and
therefore
permanently
detached
from
the
regiment
under
these
circumstances
i
gave
up
everything
like
a
special
course
of
reading
and
only
read
thereafter
for
my
own
amusement
and
not
very
much
for
that
until
the
war
was
over
i
kept
a
horse
and
rode
and
staid
out
of
doors
most
of
the
time
by
day
and
entirely
recovered
from
the
cough
which
i
had
carried
from
west
point
and
from
all
indications
of
consumption
i
have
often
thought
that
my
life
was
saved
and
my
health
restored
by
exercise
and
exposure
enforced
by
an
administrative
act
and
a
war
both
of
which
i
disapproved
as
summer
wore
away
and
cool
days
and
colder
nights
came
upon
us
the
tents
e
were
occupying
ceased
to
afford
comfortable
quarters
and
further
orders
not
reaching
us
we
began
to
look
about
to
remedy
the
hardship
men
were
put
to
work
getting
out
timber
to
build
huts
and
in
a
very
short
time
all
were
comfortably
housed
privates
as
well
as
officers
the
outlay
by
the
government
in
accomplishing
this
was
nothing
or
nearly
nothing
the
winter
was
spent
more
agreeably
than
the
summer
had
been
there
were
occasional
parties
given
by
the
planters
along
the
coast
as
the
bottom
lands
on
the
red
river
were
called
the
climate
was
delightful
near
the
close
of
the
short
session
of
congress
of
the
bill
for
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
was
passed
it
reached
president
tyler
on
the
of
march
and
promptly
received
his
approval
when
the
news
reached
us
we
began
to
look
again
for
further
orders
they
did
not
arrive
promptly
and
on
the
of
may
following
i
asked
and
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
for
twenty
days
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
louis
the
object
of
this
visit
has
been
before
stated
early
in
july
the
long
expected
orders
were
received
but
they
only
took
the
regiment
to
new
orleans
barracks
we
reached
there
before
the
middle
of
the
month
and
again
waited
weeks
for
still
further
orders
the
yellow
fever
was
raging
in
new
orleans
during
the
time
we
remained
there
and
the
streets
of
the
city
had
the
appearance
of
a
continuous
sunday
i
recollect
but
one
occasion
when
this
observance
seemed
to
be
broken
by
the
inhabitants
one
morning
about
daylight
i
happened
to
be
awake
and
hearing
the
discharge
of
a
rifle
not
far
off
i
looked
out
to
ascertain
where
the
sound
came
from
i
observed
a
couple
of
clusters
of
men
near
by
and
learned
afterwards
that
it
was
nothing
only
a
couple
of
gentlemen
deciding
a
difference
of
opinion
with
rifles
at
twenty
paces
i
do
not
remember
if
either
was
killed
or
even
hurt
but
no
doubt
the
question
of
difference
was
settled
satisfactorily
and
honorably
in
the
estimation
of
the
parties
engaged
i
do
not
believe
i
ever
would
have
the
courage
to
fight
a
duel
if
any
man
should
wrong
me
to
the
extent
of
my
being
willing
to
kill
him
i
would
not
be
willing
to
give
him
the
choice
of
weapons
with
which
it
should
be
done
and
of
the
time
place
and
distance
separating
us
when
i
executed
him
if
i
should
do
another
such
a
wrong
as
to
justify
him
in
killing
me
i
would
make
any
reasonable
atonement
within
my
power
if
convinced
of
the
wrong
done
i
place
my
opposition
to
duelling
on
higher
grounds
than
here
stated
no
doubt
a
majority
of
the
duels
fought
have
been
for
want
of
moral
courage
on
the
part
of
those
engaged
to
decline
at
camp
salubrity
and
when
we
went
to
new
orleans
barracks
the
infantry
was
commanded
by
colonel
vose
then
an
old
gentleman
who
had
not
commanded
on
drill
for
a
number
of
years
he
was
not
a
man
to
discover
infirmity
in
the
presence
of
danger
it
now
appeared
that
war
was
imminent
and
he
felt
that
it
was
his
duty
to
brush
up
his
tactics
accordingly
when
we
got
settled
down
at
our
new
post
he
took
command
of
the
regiment
at
a
battalion
drill
only
two
or
three
evolutions
had
been
gone
through
when
he
dismissed
the
battalion
and
turning
to
go
to
his
own
quarters
dropped
dead
he
had
not
been
complaining
of
ill
health
but
no
doubt
died
of
heart
disease
he
was
a
most
estimable
man
of
exemplary
habits
and
by
no
means
the
author
of
his
own
disease

in

supplying
transportation
early
in
september
the
regiment
left
new
orleans
for
corpus
christi
now
in
texas
ocean
steamers
were
not
then
common
and
the
passage
was
made
in
sailing
vessels
at
that
time
there
was
not
more
than
three
feet
of
water
in
the
channel
at
the
outlet
of
corpus
christi
bay
the
debarkation
therefore
had
to
take
place
by
small
steamers
and
at
an
island
in
the
channel
called
shell
island
the
ships
anchoring
some
miles
out
from
shore
this
made
the
work
slow
and
as
the
army
was
only
supplied
with
one
or
two
steamers
it
took
a
number
of
days
to
effect
the
landing
of
a
single
regiment
with
its
stores
camp
and
garrison
equipage
etc
there
happened
to
be
pleasant
weather
while
this
was
going
on
but
the
was
so
great
that
when
the
ship
and
steamer
were
on
opposite
sides
of
the
same
wave
they
would
be
at
considerable
distance
apart
the
men
and
baggage
were
let
down
to
a
point
higher
than
the
lower
deck
of
the
steamer
and
when
ship
and
steamer
got
into
the
trough
between
the
waves
and
were
close
together
the
load
would
be
drawn
over
the
steamer
and
rapidly
run
down
until
it
rested
on
the
deck
after
i
had
gone
ashore
and
had
been
on
guard
several
days
at
shell
island
quite
six
miles
from
the
ship
i
had
occasion
for
some
reason
or
other
to
return
on
board
while
on
the
suviah
i
think
that
was
the
name
of
our
vessel
i
heard
a
tremendous
racket
at
the
other
end
of
the
ship
and
much
and
excited
sailor
language
such
as
damn
your
eyes
etc
in
a
moment
or
two
the
captain
who
was
an
excitable
little
man
dying
with
consumption
and
not
weighing
much
over
a
hundred
pounds
came
running
out
carrying
a
sabre
nearly
as
large
and
as
heavy
as
he
was
and
crying
that
his
men
had
mutinied
it
was
necessary
to
sustain
the
captain
without
question
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
sailors
charged
with
mutiny
were
in
irons
i
rather
felt
for
a
time
a
wish
that
i
had
not
gone
aboard
just
then
as
the
men
charged
with
mutiny
submitted
to
being
placed
in
irons
without
resistance
i
always
doubted
if
they
knew
that
they
had
mutinied
until
they
were
told
by
the
time
i
was
ready
to
leave
the
ship
again
i
thought
i
had
learned
enough
of
the
working
of
the
double
and
single
pulley
by
which
passengers
were
let
down
from
the
upper
deck
of
the
ship
to
the
steamer
below
and
determined
to
let
myself
down
without
assistance
without
saying
anything
of
my
intentions
to
any
one
i
mounted
the
railing
and
taking
hold
of
the
centre
rope
just
below
the
upper
block
i
put
one
foot
on
the
hook
below
the
lower
block
and
stepped
off
just
as
i
did
so
some
one
called
out
hold
on
it
was
too
late
i
tried
to
hold
on
with
all
my
might
but
my
heels
went
up
and
my
head
went
down
so
rapidly
that
my
hold
broke
and
i
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
water
some
feet
below
with
such
velocity
that
it
seemed
to
me
i
never
would
stop
when
i
came
to
the
surface
again
being
a
fair
swimmer
and
not
having
lost
my
presence
of
mind
i
swam
around
until
a
bucket
was
let
down
for
me
and
i
was
drawn
up
without
a
scratch
or
injury
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
man
on
board
who
sympathized
with
me
in
the
least
when
they
found
me
uninjured
i
rather
enjoyed
the
joke
myself
the
captain
of
the
suviah
died
of
his
disease
a
few
months
later
and
i
believe
before
the
mutineers
were
tried
i
hope
they
got
clear
because
as
before
stated
i
always
thought
the
mutiny
was
all
in
the
brain
of
a
very
weak
and
sick
man
after
reaching
shore
or
shell
island
the
labor
of
getting
to
corpus
christi
was
slow
and
tedious
there
was
if
my
memory
serves
me
but
one
small
steamer
to
transport
troops
and
baggage
when
the
infantry
arrived
others
were
procured
later
the
distance
from
shell
island
to
corpus
christi
was
some
sixteen
or
eighteen
miles
the
channel
to
the
bay
was
so
shallow
that
the
steamer
small
as
it
was
had
to
be
dragged
over
the
bottom
when
loaded
not
more
than
one
trip
a
day
could
be
effected
later
this
was
remedied
by
deepening
the
channel
and
increasing
the
number
of
vessels
suitable
to
its
navigation
corpus
christi
is
near
the
head
of
the
bay
of
the
same
name
formed
by
the
entrance
of
the
nueces
river
into
and
is
on
the
west
bank
of
that
bay
at
the
time
of
its
first
occupancy
by
united
states
troops
there
was
a
small
mexican
hamlet
there
containing
probably
less
than
one
hundred
souls
there
was
in
addition
a
small
american
trading
post
at
which
goods
were
sold
to
mexican
smugglers
all
goods
were
put
up
in
compact
packages
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
each
suitable
for
loading
on
pack
mules
two
of
these
packages
made
a
load
for
an
ordinary
mexican
mule
and
three
for
the
larger
ones
the
bulk
of
the
trade
was
in
leaf
tobacco
and
domestic
and
calicoes
the
mexicans
had
before
the
arrival
of
the
army
but
little
to
offer
in
exchange
except
silver
the
trade
in
tobacco
was
enormous
considering
the
population
to
be
supplied
almost
every
mexican
above
the
age
of
ten
years
and
many
much
younger
smoked
the
cigarette
nearly
every
mexican
carried
a
pouch
of
leaf
tobacco
powdered
by
rolling
in
the
hands
and
a
roll
of
corn
husks
to
make
wrappers
the
cigarettes
were
made
by
the
smokers
as
they
used
them
up
to
the
time
of
which
i
write
and
for
years
afterwards
i
think
until
the
administration
of
president
juarez
the
cultivation
manufacture
and
sale
of
tobacco
constituted
a
government
monopoly
and
paid
the
bulk
of
the
revenue
collected
from
internal
sources
the
price
was
enormously
high
and
made
successful
smuggling
very
profitable
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
tobacco
is
probably
the
reason
why
everybody
male
and
female
used
it
at
that
time
i
know
from
my
own
experience
that
when
i
was
at
west
point
the
fact
that
tobacco
in
every
form
was
prohibited
and
the
mere
possession
of
the
weed
severely
punished
made
the
majority
of
the
cadets
myself
included
try
to
acquire
the
habit
of
using
it
i
failed
utterly
at
the
time
and
for
many
years
afterward
but
the
majority
accomplished
the
object
of
their
youthful
ambition
under
spanish
rule
mexico
was
prohibited
from
producing
anything
that
the
could
supply
this
rule
excluded
the
cultivation
of
the
grape
olive
and
many
other
articles
to
which
the
soil
and
climate
were
well
adapted
the
country
was
governed
for
revenue
only
and
tobacco
which
can
not
be
raised
in
spain
but
is
indigenous
to
mexico
offered
a
fine
instrumentality
for
securing
this
prime
object
of
government
the
native
population
had
been
in
the
habit
of
using
the
weed
from
a
period
back
of
any
recorded
history
of
this
continent
bad
habits
if
not
restrained
by
law
or
public
opinion
spread
more
rapidly
and
universally
than
good
ones
and
the
spanish
colonists
adopted
the
use
of
tobacco
almost
as
generally
as
the
natives
spain
therefore
in
order
to
secure
the
largest
revenue
from
this
source
prohibited
the
cultivation
except
in
specified
localities
and
in
these
places
farmed
out
the
privilege
at
a
very
high
price
the
tobacco
when
raised
could
only
be
sold
to
the
government
and
the
price
to
the
consumer
was
limited
only
by
the
avarice
of
the
authorities
and
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
pay
all
laws
for
the
government
of
the
country
were
enacted
in
spain
and
the
officers
for
their
execution
were
appointed
by
the
crown
and
sent
out
to
the
new
el
dorado
the
mexicans
had
been
brought
up
ignorant
of
how
to
legislate
or
how
to
rule
when
they
gained
their
independence
after
many
years
of
war
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
adopt
as
their
own
the
laws
then
in
existence
the
only
change
was
that
mexico
became
her
own
executor
of
the
laws
and
the
recipient
of
the
revenues
the
tobacco
tax
yielding
so
large
a
revenue
under
the
law
as
it
stood
was
one
of
the
last
if
not
the
very
last
of
the
obnoxious
imposts
to
be
repealed
now
the
citizens
are
allowed
to
cultivate
any
crops
the
soil
will
yield
tobacco
is
cheap
and
every
quality
can
be
produced
its
use
is
by
no
means
so
general
as
when
i
first
visited
the
country
gradually
the
army
of
occupation
assembled
at
corpus
christi
when
it
was
all
together
it
consisted
of
seven
companies
of
the
regiment
of
dragoons
four
companies
of
light
artillery
five
regiments
of
infantry
the
and
and
one
regiment
of
artillery
acting
as
infantry
not
more
than
three
thousand
men
in
all
general
zachary
taylor
commanded
the
whole
there
were
troops
enough
in
one
body
to
establish
a
drill
and
discipline
sufficient
to
fit
men
and
officers
for
all
they
were
capable
of
in
case
of
battle
the
rank
and
file
were
composed
of
men
who
had
enlisted
in
time
of
peace
to
serve
for
seven
dollars
a
month
and
were
necessarily
inferior
as
material
to
the
average
volunteers
enlisted
later
in
the
war
expressly
to
fight
and
also
to
the
volunteers
in
the
war
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
the
men
engaged
in
the
mexican
war
were
brave
and
the
officers
of
the
regular
army
from
highest
to
lowest
were
educated
in
their
profession
a
more
efficient
army
for
its
number
and
armament
i
do
not
believe
ever
fought
a
battle
than
the
one
commanded
by
general
taylor
in
his
first
two
engagements
on
mexican
or
texan
soil
the
presence
of
united
states
troops
on
the
edge
of
the
disputed
territory
furthest
from
the
mexican
settlements
was
not
sufficient
to
provoke
hostilities
we
were
sent
to
provoke
a
fight
but
it
was
essential
that
mexico
should
commence
it
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
congress
would
declare
war
but
if
mexico
should
attack
our
troops
the
executive
could
announce
whereas
war
exists
by
the
acts
of
and
prosecute
the
contest
with
vigor
once
initiated
there
were
but
few
public
men
who
would
have
the
courage
to
oppose
it
experience
proves
that
the
man
who
obstructs
a
war
in
which
his
nation
is
engaged
no
matter
whether
right
or
wrong
occupies
no
enviable
place
in
life
or
history
better
for
him
individually
to
advocate
war
pestilence
and
famine
than
to
act
as
obstructionist
to
a
war
already
begun
the
history
of
the
defeated
rebel
will
be
honorable
hereafter
compared
with
that
of
the
northern
man
who
aided
him
by
conspiring
against
his
government
while
protected
by
it
the
most
favorable
posthumous
history
the
traitor
can
hope
for
is
oblivion
mexico
showing
no
willingness
to
come
to
the
nueces
to
drive
the
invaders
from
her
soil
it
became
necessary
for
the
invaders
to
approach
to
within
a
convenient
distance
to
be
struck
accordingly
preparations
were
begun
for
moving
the
army
to
the
rio
grande
to
a
point
near
matamoras
it
was
desirable
to
occupy
a
position
near
the
largest
centre
of
population
possible
to
reach
without
absolutely
invading
territory
to
which
we
set
up
no
claim
whatever
the
distance
from
corpus
christi
to
matamoras
is
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
the
country
does
not
abound
in
fresh
water
and
the
length
of
the
marches
had
to
be
regulated
by
the
distance
between
water
supplies
besides
the
streams
there
were
occasional
pools
filled
during
the
rainy
season
some
probably
made
by
the
traders
who
travelled
constantly
between
corpus
christi
and
the
rio
grande
and
some
by
the
buffalo
there
was
not
at
that
time
a
single
habitation
cultivated
field
or
herd
of
domestic
animals
between
corpus
christi
and
matamoras
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
have
a
wagon
train
sufficiently
large
to
transport
the
camp
and
garrison
equipage
officers
baggage
rations
for
the
army
and
part
rations
of
grain
for
the
artillery
horses
and
all
the
animals
taken
from
the
north
where
they
had
been
accustomed
to
having
their
forage
furnished
them
the
army
was
but
indifferently
supplied
with
transportation
wagons
and
harness
could
easily
be
supplied
from
the
north
but
mules
and
horses
could
not
so
readily
be
brought
the
american
traders
and
mexican
smugglers
came
to
the
relief
contracts
were
made
for
mules
at
from
eight
to
eleven
dollars
each
the
smugglers
furnished
the
animals
and
took
their
pay
in
goods
of
the
description
before
mentioned
i
doubt
whether
the
mexicans
received
in
value
from
the
traders
five
dollars
per
head
for
the
animals
they
furnished
and
still
more
whether
they
paid
anything
but
their
own
time
in
procuring
them
such
is
trade
such
is
war
the
government
paid
in
hard
cash
to
the
contractor
the
stipulated
price
between
the
rio
grande
and
the
nueces
there
was
at
that
time
a
large
band
of
wild
horses
feeding
as
numerous
probably
as
the
band
of
buffalo
roaming
further
north
was
before
its
rapid
extermination
commenced
the
mexicans
used
to
capture
these
in
large
numbers
and
bring
them
into
the
american
settlements
and
sell
them
a
picked
animal
could
be
purchased
at
from
eight
to
twelve
dollars
but
taken
at
wholesale
they
could
be
bought
for
dollars
a
dozen
some
of
these
were
purchased
for
the
army
and
answered
a
most
useful
purpose
the
horses
were
generally
very
strong
formed
much
like
the
norman
horse
and
with
very
heavy
manes
and
tails
a
number
of
officers
supplied
themselves
with
these
and
they
generally
rendered
as
useful
service
as
the
northern
animal
in
fact
they
were
much
better
when
grazing
was
the
only
means
of
supplying
forage
there
was
no
need
for
haste
and
some
months
were
consumed
in
the
necessary
preparations
for
a
move
in
the
meantime
the
army
was
engaged
in
all
the
duties
pertaining
to
the
officer
and
the
soldier
twice
that
i
remember
small
trains
were
sent
from
corpus
christi
with
cavalry
escorts
to
san
antonio
and
austin
with
paymasters
and
funds
to
pay
off
small
detachments
of
troops
stationed
at
those
places
general
taylor
encouraged
officers
to
accompany
these
expeditions
i
accompanied
one
of
them
in
december
the
distance
from
corpus
christi
to
san
antonio
was
then
computed
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
now
that
roads
exist
it
is
probably
less
from
san
antonio
to
austin
we
computed
the
distance
at
one
hundred
and
ten
miles
and
from
the
latter
place
back
to
corpus
christi
at
over
two
hundred
miles
i
know
the
distance
now
from
san
antonio
to
austin
is
but
little
over
eighty
miles
so
that
our
computation
was
probably
too
high
there
was
not
at
the
time
an
individual
living
between
corpus
christi
and
san
antonio
until
within
about
thirty
miles
of
the
latter
point
where
there
were
a
few
scattering
mexican
settlements
along
the
san
antonio
river
the
people
in
at
least
one
of
these
hamlets
lived
underground
for
protection
against
the
indians
the
country
abounded
in
game
such
as
deer
and
antelope
with
abundance
of
wild
turkeys
along
the
streams
and
where
there
were
woods
on
the
nueces
about
miles
up
from
corpus
christi
were
a
few
log
cabins
the
remains
of
a
town
called
san
patricio
but
the
inhabitants
had
all
been
massacred
by
the
indians
or
driven
away
san
antonio
was
about
equally
divided
in
population
between
americans
and
mexicans
from
there
to
austin
there
was
not
a
single
residence
except
at
new
braunfels
on
the
guadalupe
river
at
that
point
was
a
settlement
of
germans
who
had
only
that
year
come
into
the
state
at
all
events
they
were
living
in
small
huts
about
such
as
soldiers
would
hastily
construct
for
temporary
occupation
from
austin
to
corpus
christi
there
was
only
a
small
settlement
at
bastrop
with
a
few
farms
along
the
colorado
river
but
after
leaving
that
there
were
no
settlements
except
the
home
of
one
man
with
one
female
slave
at
the
old
town
of
goliad
some
of
the
houses
were
still
standing
goliad
had
been
quite
a
village
for
the
period
and
region
but
some
years
before
there
had
been
a
mexican
massacre
in
which
every
inhabitant
had
been
killed
or
driven
away
this
with
the
massacre
of
the
prisoners
in
the
alamo
san
antonio
about
the
same
time
more
than
three
hundred
men
in
all
furnished
the
strongest
justification
the
texans
had
for
carrying
on
the
war
with
so
much
cruelty
in
fact
from
that
time
until
the
mexican
war
the
hostilities
between
texans
and
mexicans
was
so
great
that
neither
was
safe
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
other
who
might
be
in
superior
numbers
or
possessed
of
superior
arms
the
man
we
found
living
there
seemed
like
an
old
friend
he
had
come
from
near
fort
jessup
louisiana
where
the
officers
of
the
and
infantry
and
the
dragoons
had
known
him
and
his
family
he
had
emigrated
in
advance
of
his
family
to
build
up
a
home
for
them
chapter
trip
to
austin
promotion
to
full
second
lieutenant
army
of
occupation
when
our
party
left
corpus
christi
it
was
quite
large
including
the
cavalry
escort
paymaster
major
dix
his
clerk
and
the
officers
who
like
myself
were
simply
on
leave
but
all
the
officers
on
leave
except
lieutenant
benjamin
afterwards
killed
in
the
valley
of
mexico
lieutenant
now
general
augur
and
myself
concluded
to
spend
their
allotted
time
at
san
antonio
and
return
from
there
we
were
all
to
be
back
at
corpus
christi
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
paymaster
was
detained
in
austin
so
long
that
if
we
had
waited
for
him
we
would
have
exceeded
our
leave
we
concluded
therefore
to
start
back
at
once
with
the
animals
we
had
and
having
to
rely
principally
on
grass
for
their
food
it
was
a
good
six
days
journey
we
had
to
sleep
on
the
prairie
every
night
except
at
goliad
and
possibly
one
night
on
the
colorado
without
shelter
and
with
only
such
food
as
we
carried
with
us
and
prepared
ourselves
the
journey
was
hazardous
on
account
of
indians
and
there
were
white
men
in
texas
whom
i
would
not
have
cared
to
meet
in
a
secluded
place
lieutenant
augur
was
taken
seriously
sick
before
we
reached
goliad
and
at
a
distance
from
any
habitation
to
add
to
the
complication
his
horse
a
mustang
that
had
probably
been
captured
from
the
band
of
wild
horses
before
alluded
to
and
of
undoubted
longevity
at
his
capture
gave
out
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
get
for
ward
to
goliad
to
find
a
shelter
for
our
sick
companion
by
dint
of
patience
and
exceedingly
slow
movements
goliad
was
at
last
reached
and
a
shelter
and
bed
secured
for
our
patient
we
remained
over
a
day
hoping
that
augur
might
recover
sufficiently
to
resume
his
travels
he
did
not
however
and
knowing
that
major
dix
would
be
along
in
a
few
days
with
his
now
empty
and
escort
we
arranged
with
our
louisiana
friend
to
take
the
best
of
care
of
the
sick
lieutenant
until
thus
relieved
and
went
on
i
had
never
been
a
sportsman
in
my
life
had
scarcely
ever
gone
in
search
of
game
and
rarely
seen
any
when
looking
for
it
on
this
trip
there
was
no
minute
of
time
while
travelling
between
san
patricio
and
the
settlements
on
the
san
antonio
river
from
san
antonio
to
austin
and
again
from
the
colorado
river
back
to
san
patricio
when
deer
or
antelope
could
not
be
seen
in
great
numbers
each
officer
carried
a
and
every
evening
after
going
into
camp
some
would
go
out
and
soon
return
with
venison
and
wild
turkeys
enough
for
the
entire
camp
i
however
never
went
out
and
had
no
occasion
to
fire
my
gun
except
being
detained
over
a
day
at
goliad
benjamin
and
i
concluded
to
go
down
to
the
creek
which
was
fringed
with
timber
much
of
it
the
pecan
and
bring
back
a
few
turkeys
we
had
scarcely
reached
the
edge
of
the
timber
when
i
heard
the
flutter
of
wings
overhead
and
in
an
instant
i
saw
two
or
three
turkeys
flying
away
these
were
soon
followed
by
more
then
more
and
more
until
a
flock
of
twenty
or
thirty
had
left
from
just
over
my
head
all
this
time
i
stood
watching
the
turkeys
to
see
where
they
flew
with
my
gun
on
my
shoulder
and
never
once
thought
of
levelling
it
at
the
birds
when
i
had
time
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
a
sportsman
i
was
a
failure
and
went
back
to
the
house
benjamin
remained
out
and
got
as
many
turkeys
as
he
wanted
to
carry
back
after
the
second
night
at
goliad
benjamin
and
i
started
to
make
the
remainder
of
the
journey
alone
we
reached
corpus
christi
just
in
time
to
avoid
absence
without
leave
we
met
no
one
not
even
an
indian
during
the
remainder
of
our
journey
except
at
san
patricio
a
new
settlement
had
been
started
there
in
our
absence
of
three
weeks
induced
possibly
by
the
fact
that
there
were
houses
already
built
while
the
proximity
of
troops
gave
protection
against
the
indians
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
out
from
goliad
we
heard
the
most
unearthly
howling
of
wolves
directly
in
our
front
the
prairie
grass
was
tall
and
we
could
not
see
the
beasts
but
the
sound
indicated
that
they
were
near
to
my
ear
it
appeared
that
there
must
have
been
enough
of
them
to
devour
our
party
horses
and
all
at
a
single
meal
the
part
of
ohio
that
i
hailed
from
was
not
thickly
settled
but
wolves
had
been
driven
out
long
before
i
left
benjamin
was
from
indiana
still
less
populated
where
the
wolf
yet
roamed
over
the
prairies
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
animal
and
the
capacity
of
a
few
to
make
believe
there
was
an
unlimited
number
of
them
he
kept
on
towards
the
noise
unmoved
i
followed
in
his
trail
lacking
moral
courage
to
turn
back
and
join
our
sick
companion
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
benjamin
had
proposed
returning
to
goliad
i
would
not
only
have
seconded
the
motion
but
have
suggested
that
it
was
very
in
us
to
leave
augur
sick
there
in
the
first
place
but
benjamin
did
not
propose
turning
back
when
he
did
speak
it
was
to
ask
grant
how
many
wolves
do
you
think
there
are
in
that
pack
knowing
where
he
was
from
and
suspecting
that
he
thought
i
would
the
number
i
determined
to
show
my
acquaintance
with
the
animal
by
putting
the
estimate
below
what
possibly
could
be
correct
and
answered
oh
about
twenty
very
indifferently
he
smiled
and
rode
on
in
a
minute
we
were
close
upon
them
and
before
they
saw
us
there
were
just
two
of
them
seated
upon
their
haunches
with
their
mouths
close
together
they
had
made
all
the
noise
we
had
been
hearing
for
the
past
ten
minutes
i
have
often
thought
of
this
incident
since
when
i
have
heard
the
noise
of
a
few
disappointed
politicians
who
had
deserted
their
associates
there
are
always
more
of
them
before
they
are
counted
a
week
or
two
before
leaving
corpus
christi
on
this
trip
i
had
been
promoted
from
brevet
infantry
to
full
infantry
frank
gardner
of
the
was
promoted
to
the
in
the
same
orders
we
immediately
made
application
to
be
transferred
so
as
to
get
back
to
our
old
regiments
on
my
return
i
found
that
our
application
had
been
approved
at
washington
while
in
the
infantry
i
was
in
the
company
of
captain
holmes
afterwards
a
in
the
confederate
army
i
never
came
in
contact
with
him
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
nor
did
he
render
any
very
conspicuous
service
in
his
high
rank
my
transfer
carried
me
to
the
company
of
captain
mccall
who
resigned
from
the
army
after
the
mexican
war
and
settled
in
philadelphia
he
was
prompt
however
to
volunteer
when
the
rebellion
broke
out
and
soon
rose
to
the
rank
of
in
the
union
army
i
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
meet
him
after
he
resigned
in
the
old
army
he
was
esteemed
very
highly
as
a
soldier
and
gentleman
our
relations
were
always
most
pleasant
the
preparations
at
corpus
christi
for
an
advance
progressed
as
rapidly
in
the
absence
of
some
twenty
or
more
lieutenants
as
if
we
had
been
there
the
principal
business
consisted
in
securing
mules
and
getting
them
broken
to
harness
the
process
was
slow
but
amusing
the
animals
sold
to
the
government
were
all
young
and
unbroken
even
to
the
saddle
and
were
quite
as
wild
as
the
wild
horses
of
the
prairie
usually
a
number
would
be
brought
in
by
a
company
of
mexicans
partners
in
the
delivery
the
mules
were
first
driven
into
a
stockade
called
a
corral
inclosing
an
acre
or
more
of
ground
the
mexicans
who
were
all
experienced
in
throwing
the
lasso
would
go
into
the
corral
on
horseback
with
their
lassos
attached
to
the
pommels
of
their
saddles
soldiers
detailed
as
teamsters
and
black
smiths
would
also
enter
the
corral
the
former
with
ropes
to
serve
as
halters
the
latter
with
branding
irons
and
a
fire
to
keep
the
irons
heated
a
lasso
was
then
thrown
over
the
neck
of
a
mule
when
he
would
immediately
go
to
the
length
of
his
tether
first
one
end
then
the
other
in
the
air
while
he
was
thus
plunging
and
gyrating
another
lasso
would
be
thrown
by
another
mexican
catching
the
animal
by
a
this
would
bring
the
mule
to
the
ground
when
he
was
seized
and
held
by
the
teamsters
while
the
blacksmith
put
upon
him
with
hot
irons
the
initials
ropes
were
then
put
about
the
neck
with
a
slipnoose
which
would
tighten
around
the
throat
if
pulled
with
a
man
on
each
side
holding
these
ropes
the
mule
was
released
from
his
other
bindings
and
allowed
to
rise
with
more
or
less
difficulty
he
would
be
conducted
to
a
picket
rope
outside
and
fastened
there
the
delivery
of
that
mule
was
then
complete
this
process
was
gone
through
with
every
mule
and
wild
horse
with
the
army
of
occupation
the
method
of
breaking
them
was
less
cruel
and
much
more
amusing
it
is
a
fact
that
where
domestic
animals
are
used
for
specific
purposes
from
generation
to
generation
the
descendants
are
easily
as
a
rule
subdued
to
the
same
uses
at
that
time
in
northern
mexico
the
mule
or
his
ancestors
the
horse
and
the
ass
was
seldom
used
except
for
the
saddle
or
pack
at
all
events
the
corpus
christi
mule
resisted
the
new
use
to
which
he
was
being
put
the
treatment
he
was
subjected
to
in
order
to
overcome
his
prejudices
was
summary
and
effective
the
soldiers
were
principally
foreigners
who
had
enlisted
in
our
large
cities
and
with
the
exception
of
a
chance
drayman
among
them
it
is
not
probable
that
any
of
the
men
who
reported
themselves
as
competent
teamsters
had
ever
driven
a
in
their
lives
or
indeed
that
many
had
had
any
previous
experience
in
driving
any
animal
whatever
to
harness
numbers
together
can
accomplish
what
twice
their
number
acting
individually
could
not
perform
five
mules
were
allotted
to
each
wagon
a
teamster
would
select
at
the
picket
rope
five
animals
of
nearly
the
same
color
and
general
appearance
for
his
team
with
a
full
corps
of
assistants
other
teamsters
he
would
then
proceed
to
get
his
mules
together
in
two
the
men
would
approach
each
animal
selected
avoiding
as
far
as
possible
its
heels
two
ropes
would
be
put
about
the
neck
of
each
animal
with
a
slip
noose
so
that
he
could
be
choked
if
too
unruly
they
were
then
led
out
harnessed
by
force
and
hitched
to
the
wagon
in
the
position
they
had
to
keep
ever
after
two
men
remained
on
either
side
of
the
leader
with
the
lassos
about
its
neck
and
one
man
retained
the
same
restraining
influence
over
each
of
the
others
all
being
ready
the
hold
would
be
slackened
and
the
team
started
the
first
motion
was
generally
five
mules
in
the
air
at
one
time
backs
bowed
hind
feet
extended
to
the
rear
after
repeating
this
movement
a
few
times
the
leaders
would
start
to
run
this
would
bring
the
breeching
tight
against
the
mules
at
the
wheels
which
these
last
seemed
to
regard
as
a
most
unwarrantable
attempt
at
coercion
and
would
resist
by
taking
a
seat
sometimes
going
so
far
as
to
lie
down
in
time
all
were
broken
in
to
do
their
duty
submissively
if
not
cheerfully
but
there
never
was
a
time
during
the
war
when
it
was
safe
to
let
a
mexican
mule
get
entirely
loose
their
drivers
were
all
teamsters
by
the
time
they
got
through
i
recollect
one
case
of
a
mule
that
had
worked
in
a
team
under
the
saddle
not
only
for
some
time
at
corpus
christi
where
he
was
broken
but
all
the
way
to
the
point
opposite
matamoras
then
to
camargo
where
he
got
loose
from
his
fastenings
during
the
night
he
did
not
run
away
at
first
but
staid
in
the
neighborhood
for
a
day
or
two
coming
up
sometimes
to
the
feed
trough
even
but
on
the
approach
of
the
teamster
he
always
got
out
of
the
way
at
last
growing
tired
of
the
constant
effort
to
catch
him
he
disappeared
altogether
nothing
short
of
a
mexican
with
his
lasso
could
have
caught
him
regulations
would
not
have
warranted
the
expenditure
of
a
dollar
in
hiring
a
man
with
a
lasso
to
catch
that
mule
but
they
did
allow
the
expenditure
of
the
mule
on
a
certificate
that
he
had
run
away
without
any
fault
of
the
quartermaster
on
whose
returns
he
was
borne
and
also
the
purchase
of
another
to
take
his
place
i
am
a
competent
witness
for
i
was
regimental
quartermaster
at
the
time
while
at
corpus
christi
all
the
officers
who
had
a
fancy
for
riding
kept
horses
the
animals
cost
but
little
in
the
first
instance
and
when
picketed
they
would
get
their
living
without
any
cost
i
had
three
not
long
before
the
army
moved
but
a
sad
accident
bereft
me
of
them
all
at
one
time
a
colored
boy
who
gave
them
all
the
attention
they
got
besides
looking
after
my
tent
and
that
of
a
and
and
cooking
for
us
all
for
about
eight
dollars
per
month
was
riding
one
to
water
and
leading
the
other
two
the
led
horses
pulled
him
from
his
seat
and
all
three
ran
away
they
never
were
heard
of
afterwards
shortly
after
that
some
one
told
captain
bliss
general
taylor
of
my
misfortune
yes
i
heard
grant
lost
five
or
six
dollars
worth
of
horses
the
other
day
he
replied
that
was
a
slander
they
were
broken
to
the
saddle
when
i
got
them
and
cost
nearly
twenty
dollars
i
never
suspected
the
colored
boy
of
malicious
intent
in
letting
them
get
away
because
if
they
had
not
escaped
he
could
have
had
one
of
them
to
ride
on
the
long
march
then
in
prospect
chapter
vi
advance
of
the
army
crossing
the
colorado
the
rio
grande
at
last
the
preparations
were
complete
and
orders
were
issued
for
the
advance
to
begin
on
the
of
march
general
taylor
had
an
army
of
not
more
than
three
thousand
men
one
battery
the
siege
guns
and
all
the
convalescent
troops
were
sent
on
by
water
to
brazos
santiago
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
a
guard
was
left
back
at
corpus
christi
to
look
after
public
property
and
to
take
care
of
those
who
were
too
sick
to
be
removed
the
remainder
of
the
army
probably
not
more
than
twenty
five
hundred
men
was
divided
into
three
brigades
with
the
cavalry
independent
colonel
twiggs
with
seven
companies
of
dragoons
and
a
battery
of
light
artillery
moved
on
the
he
was
followed
by
the
three
infantry
brigades
with
a
day
interval
between
the
commands
thus
the
rear
brigade
did
not
move
from
corpus
christi
until
the
of
march
in
view
of
the
immense
bodies
of
men
moved
on
the
same
day
over
narrow
roads
through
dense
forests
and
across
large
streams
in
our
late
war
it
seems
strange
now
that
a
body
of
less
than
three
thousand
men
should
have
been
broken
into
four
columns
separated
by
a
march
general
taylor
was
opposed
to
anything
like
plundering
by
the
troops
and
in
this
instance
i
doubt
not
he
looked
upon
the
enemy
as
the
aggrieved
party
and
was
not
willing
to
injure
them
further
than
his
instructions
from
washington
demanded
his
orders
to
the
troops
enjoined
scrupulous
regard
for
the
rights
of
all
peaceable
persons
and
the
payment
of
the
highest
price
for
all
supplies
taken
for
the
use
of
the
army
all
officers
of
foot
regiments
who
had
horses
were
permitted
to
ride
them
on
the
march
when
it
did
not
interfere
with
their
military
duties
as
already
related
having
lost
my
five
or
six
dollars
worth
of
horses
but
a
short
time
before
i
determined
not
to
get
another
but
to
make
the
journey
on
foot
my
company
commander
captain
mccall
had
two
good
american
horses
of
considerably
more
value
in
that
country
where
native
horses
were
cheap
than
they
were
in
the
states
he
used
one
himself
and
wanted
the
other
for
his
servant
he
was
quite
anxious
to
know
whether
i
did
not
intend
to
get
me
another
horse
before
the
march
began
i
told
him
no
i
belonged
to
a
foot
regiment
i
did
not
understand
the
object
of
his
solicitude
at
the
time
but
when
we
were
about
to
start
he
said
there
grant
is
a
horse
for
you
i
found
that
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
his
servant
riding
on
a
long
march
while
his
lieutenant
went
he
had
found
a
mustang
a
old
colt
only
recently
captured
which
had
been
purchased
by
one
of
the
colored
servants
with
the
regiment
for
the
sum
of
three
dollars
it
was
probably
the
only
horse
at
corpus
christi
that
could
have
been
purchased
just
then
for
any
reasonable
price
five
dollars
and
per
cent
advance
induced
the
owner
to
part
with
the
mustang
i
was
sorry
to
take
him
because
i
really
felt
that
belonging
to
a
foot
regiment
it
was
my
duty
to
march
with
the
men
but
i
saw
the
captain
earnestness
in
the
matter
and
accepted
the
horse
for
the
trip
the
day
we
started
was
the
first
time
the
horse
had
ever
been
under
saddle
i
had
however
but
little
difficulty
in
breaking
him
though
for
the
first
day
there
were
frequent
disagreements
between
us
as
to
which
way
we
should
go
and
sometimes
whether
we
should
go
at
all
at
no
time
during
the
day
could
i
choose
exactly
the
part
of
the
column
i
would
march
with
but
after
that
i
had
as
tractable
a
horse
as
any
with
the
army
and
there
was
none
that
stood
the
trip
better
he
never
ate
a
mouthful
of
food
on
the
journey
except
the
grass
he
could
pick
within
the
length
of
his
picket
rope
a
few
days
out
from
corpus
christi
the
immense
herd
of
wild
horses
that
ranged
at
that
time
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
was
seen
directly
in
advance
of
the
head
of
the
column
and
but
a
few
miles
off
it
was
the
very
band
from
which
the
horse
i
was
riding
had
been
captured
but
a
few
weeks
before
the
column
was
halted
for
a
rest
and
a
number
of
officers
myself
among
them
rode
out
two
or
three
miles
to
the
right
to
see
the
extent
of
the
herd
the
country
was
a
rolling
prairie
and
from
the
higher
ground
the
vision
was
obstructed
only
by
the
curvature
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
to
our
right
the
herd
extended
to
the
left
it
extended
equally
there
was
no
estimating
the
number
of
animals
in
it
i
have
no
idea
that
they
could
all
have
been
corralled
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
or
delaware
at
one
time
if
they
had
been
they
would
have
been
so
thick
that
the
pasturage
would
have
given
out
the
first
day
people
who
saw
the
southern
herd
of
buffalo
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
can
appreciate
the
size
of
the
texas
band
of
wild
horses
in
at
the
point
where
the
army
struck
the
little
colorado
river
the
stream
was
quite
wide
and
of
sufficient
depth
for
navigation
the
water
was
brackish
and
the
banks
were
fringed
with
timber
here
the
whole
army
concentrated
before
attempting
to
cross
the
army
was
not
accompanied
by
a
pontoon
train
and
at
that
time
the
troops
were
not
instructed
in
bridge
building
to
add
to
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
the
army
was
here
for
the
first
time
threatened
with
opposition
buglers
concealed
from
our
view
by
the
brush
on
the
opposite
side
sounded
the
assembly
and
other
military
calls
like
the
wolves
before
spoken
of
they
gave
the
impression
that
there
was
a
large
number
of
them
and
that
if
the
troops
were
in
proportion
to
the
noise
they
were
sufficient
to
devour
general
taylor
and
his
army
there
were
probably
but
few
troops
and
those
engaged
principally
in
watching
the
movements
of
the
invader
a
few
of
our
cavalry
dashed
in
and
forded
and
swam
the
stream
and
all
opposition
was
soon
dispersed
i
do
not
remember
that
a
single
shot
was
fired
the
troops
waded
the
stream
which
was
up
to
their
necks
in
the
deepest
part
teams
were
crossed
by
attaching
a
long
rope
to
the
end
of
the
wagon
tongue
passing
it
between
the
two
swing
mules
and
by
the
side
of
the
leader
hitching
his
bridle
as
well
as
the
bridle
of
the
mules
in
rear
to
it
and
carrying
the
end
to
men
on
the
opposite
shore
the
bank
down
to
the
water
was
steep
on
both
sides
a
rope
long
enough
to
cross
the
river
therefore
was
attached
to
the
back
axle
of
the
wagon
and
men
behind
would
hold
the
rope
to
prevent
the
wagon
beating
the
mules
into
the
water
this
latter
rope
also
served
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
end
of
the
forward
one
back
to
be
used
over
again
the
water
was
deep
enough
for
a
short
distance
to
swim
the
little
mexican
mules
which
the
army
was
then
using
but
they
and
the
wagons
were
pulled
through
so
fast
by
the
men
at
the
end
of
the
rope
ahead
that
no
time
was
left
them
to
show
their
obstinacy
in
this
manner
the
artillery
and
transportation
of
the
army
of
occupation
crossed
the
colorado
river
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
march
the
advance
of
the
army
reached
the
rio
grande
and
went
into
camp
near
the
banks
of
the
river
opposite
the
city
of
matamoras
and
almost
under
the
guns
of
a
small
fort
at
the
lower
end
of
the
town
there
was
not
at
that
time
a
single
habitation
from
corpus
christi
until
the
rio
grande
was
reached
the
work
of
fortifying
was
commenced
at
once
the
fort
was
laid
out
by
the
engineers
but
the
work
was
done
by
the
soldiers
under
the
supervision
of
their
officers
the
chief
engineer
retaining
general
directions
the
mexicans
now
became
so
incensed
at
our
near
approach
that
some
of
their
troops
crossed
the
river
above
us
and
made
it
unsafe
for
small
bodies
of
men
to
go
far
beyond
the
limits
of
camp
they
captured
two
companies
of
dragoons
commanded
by
captains
thornton
and
hardee
the
latter
figured
as
a
general
in
the
late
war
on
the
confederate
side
and
was
author
of
the
tactics
first
used
by
both
armies
lieutenant
theodric
porter
of
the
infantry
was
killed
while
out
with
a
small
detachment
and
major
cross
the
assistant
had
also
been
killed
not
far
from
camp
there
was
no
base
of
supplies
nearer
than
point
isabel
on
the
coast
north
of
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and
miles
away
the
enemy
if
the
mexicans
could
be
called
such
at
this
time
when
no
war
had
been
declared
hovered
about
in
such
numbers
that
it
was
not
safe
to
send
a
wagon
train
after
supplies
with
any
escort
that
could
be
spared
i
have
already
said
that
general
taylor
whole
command
on
the
rio
grande
numbered
less
than
three
thousand
men
he
had
however
a
few
more
troops
at
point
isabel
or
brazos
santiago
the
supplies
brought
from
corpus
christi
in
wagons
were
running
short
work
was
therefore
pushed
with
great
vigor
on
the
defences
to
enable
the
minimum
number
of
troops
to
hold
the
fort
all
the
men
who
could
be
employed
were
kept
at
work
from
early
dawn
until
darkness
closed
the
labors
of
the
day
with
all
this
the
fort
was
not
completed
until
the
supplies
grew
so
short
that
further
delay
in
obtaining
more
could
not
be
thought
of
by
the
latter
part
of
april
the
work
was
in
a
partially
defensible
condition
and
the
infantry
major
jacob
brown
commanding
was
marched
in
to
garrison
it
with
some
few
pieces
of
artillery
all
the
supplies
on
hand
with
the
exception
of
enough
to
carry
the
rest
of
the
army
to
point
isabel
were
left
with
the
garrison
and
the
march
was
commenced
with
the
remainder
of
the
command
every
wagon
being
taken
with
the
army
early
on
the
second
day
after
starting
the
force
reached
its
destination
without
opposition
from
the
mexicans
there
was
some
delay
in
getting
supplies
ashore
from
vessels
at
anchor
in
the
open
roadstead

while

was
away

of
his

the
little
garrison
up
the

was
besieged
as
we
lay
in
our
tents
upon
the
the
artillery
at
the
fort
on
the
rio

could
be
distinctly
heard
the
war
had
begun
there
were
no
possible
means
of
obtaining
news
from
the
garrison
and
information
from
outside
could
not
be
otherwise
than
unfavorable
what
general
taylor
feelings
were
during
this
suspense
i
do
not
know
but
for
myself
a
young
who
had
never
heard
a
hostile
gun
before
i
felt
sorry
that
i
had
enlisted
a
great
many
men
when
they
smell
battle
afar
off
chafe
to
get
into
the
fray
when
they
say
so
themselves
they
generally
fail
to
convince
their
hearers
that
they
are
as
anxious
as
they
would
like
to
make
believe
and
as
they
approach
danger
they
become
more
subdued
this
rule
is
not
universal
for
i
have
known
a
few
men
who
were
always
aching
for
a
fight
when
there
was
no
enemy
near
who
were
as
good
as
their
word
when
the
battle
did
come
but
the
number
of
such
men
is
small
on
the
of
may
the
wagons
were
all
loaded
and
general
taylor
started
on
his
return
with
his
army
reinforced
at
point
isabel
but
still
less
than
three
thousand
strong
to
relieve
the
garrison
on
the
rio
grande
the
road
from
point
isabel
to
matamoras
is
over
an
open
rolling
treeless
prairie
until
the
timber
that
borders
the
bank
of
the
rio
grande
is
reached
this
river
like
the
mississippi
flows
through
a
rich
alluvial
valley
in
the
most
meandering
manner
running
towards
all
points
of
the
compass
at
times
within
a
few
miles
formerly
the
river
ran
by
resaca
de
la
palma
some
four
or
five
miles
east
of
the
present
channel
the
old
bed
of
the
river
at
resaca
had
become
filled
at
places
leaving
a
succession
of
little
lakes
the
timber
that
had
formerly
grown
upon
both
banks
and
for
a
considerable
distance
out
was
still
standing
this
timber
was
struck
six
or
eight
miles
out
from
the
besieged
garrison
at
a
point
known
as
palo
alto
tall
trees
or
woods
early
in
the
forenoon
of
the
of
may
as
palo
alto
was
approached
an
army
certainly
outnumbering
our
little
force
was
seen
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
just
in
front
of
the
timber
their
bayonets
and
spearheads
glistened
in
the
sunlight
formidably
the
force
was
composed
largely
of
cavalry
armed
with
lances
where
we
were
the
grass
was
tall
reaching
nearly
to
the
shoulders
of
the
men
very
stiff
and
each
stock
was
pointed
at
the
top
and
hard
and
almost
as
sharp
as
a
general
taylor
halted
his
army
before
the
head
of
column
came
in
range
of
the
artillery
of
the
mexicans
he
then
formed
a
line
of
battle
facing
the
enemy
his
artillery
two
batteries
and
two
iron
guns
drawn
by
oxen
were
placed
in
position
at
intervals
along
the
line
a
battalion
was
thrown
to
the
rear
commanded
by
childs
of
the
artillery
as
reserves
these
preparations
completed
orders
were
given
for
a
platoon
of
each
company
to
stack
arms
and
go
to
a
stream
off
to
the
right
of
the
command
to
fill
their
canteens
and
also
those
of
the
rest
of
their
respective
companies
when
the
men
were
all
back
in
their
places
in
line
the
command
to
advance
was
given
as
i
looked
down
that
long
line
of
about
three
thousand
armed
men
advancing
towards
a
larger
force
also
armed
i
thought
what
a
fearful
responsibility
general
taylor
must
feel
commanding
such
a
host
and
so
far
away
from
friends
the
mexicans
immediately
opened
fire
upon
us
first
with
artillery
and
then
with
infantry
at
first
their
shots
did
not
reach
us
and
the
advance
was
continued
as
we
got
nearer
the
cannon
balls
commenced
going
through
the
ranks
they
hurt
no
one
however
during
this
advance
because
they
would
strike
the
ground
long
before
they
reached
our
line
and
ricochetted
through
the
tall
grass
so
slowly
that
the
men
would
see
them
and
open
ranks
and
let
them
pass
when
we
got
to
a
point
where
the
artillery
could
be
used
with
effect
a
halt
was
called
and
the
battle
opened
on
both
sides
the
infantry
under
general
taylor
was
armed
with
muskets
and
paper
cartridges
charged
with
powder
and
ball
at
the
distance
of
a
few
hundred
yards
a
man
might
fire
at
you
all
day
without
your
finding
it
out
the
artillery
was
generally
brass
guns
throwing
only
solid
shot
but
general
taylor
had
with
him
three
or
four
howitzers
throwing
shell
besides
his
before
spoken
of
that
had
a
long
range
this
made
a
powerful
armament
the
mexicans
were
armed
about
as
we
were
so
far
as
their
infantry
was
concerned
but
their
artillery
only
fired
solid
shot
we
had
greatly
the
advantage
in
this
arm
the
artillery
was
advanced
a
rod
or
two
in
front
of
the
line
and
opened
fire
the
infantry
stood
at
order
arms
as
spectators
watching
the
effect
of
our
shots
upon
the
enemy
and
watching
his
shots
so
as
to
step
out
of
their
way
it
could
be
seen
that
the
and
the
howitzers
did
a
great
deal
of
execution
on
our
side
there
was
little
or
no
loss
while
we
occupied
this
position
during
the
battle
major
ringgold
an
accomplished
and
brave
artillery
officer
was
mortally
wounded
and
lieutenant
luther
also
of
the
artillery
was
struck
during
the
day
several
advances
were
made
and
just
at
dusk
it
became
evident
that
the
mexicans
were
falling
back
we
again
advanced
and
occupied
at
the
close
of
the
battle
substantially
the
ground
held
by
the
enemy
at
the
beginning
in
this
last
move
there
was
a
brisk
fire
upon
our
troops
and
some
execution
was
done
one
passed
through
our
ranks
not
far
from
me
it
took
off
the
head
of
an
enlisted
man
and
the
under
jaw
of
captain
page
of
my
regiment
while
the
splinters
from
the
musket
of
the
killed
soldier
and
his
brains
and
bones
knocked
down
two
or
three
others
including
one
officer
lieutenant
wallen
hurting
them
more
or
less
our
casualties
for
the
day
were
nine
killed
and
wounded
at
the
break
of
day
on
the
the
army
under
taylor
was
ready
to
renew
the
battle
but
an
advance
showed
that
the
enemy
had
entirely
left
our
front
during
the
night
the
chaparral
before
us
was
impenetrable
except
where
there
were
roads
or
trails
with
occasionally
clear
or
bare
spots
of
small
dimensions
a
body
of
men
penetrating
it
might
easily
be
ambushed
it
was
better
to
have
a
few
men
caught
in
this
way
than
the
whole
army
yet
it
was
necessary
that
the
garrison
at
the
river
should
be
relieved
to
get
to
them
the
chaparral
had
to
be
passed
thus
i
assume
general
taylor
reasoned
he
halted
the
army
not
far
in
advance
of
the
ground
occupied
by
the
mexicans
the
day
before
and
selected
captain
smith
of
the
artillery
and
captain
mccall
of
my
company
to
take
one
hundred
and
fifty
picked
men
each
and
find
where
the
enemy
had
gone
this
left
me
in
command
of
the
company
an
honor
and
responsibility
i
thought
very
great
smith
and
mccall
found
no
obstruction
in
the
way
of
their
advance
until
they
came
up
to
the
succession
of
ponds
before
describes
at
resaca
the
mexicans
had
passed
them
and
formed
their
lines
on
the
opposite
bank
this
position
they
had
strengthened
a
little
by
throwing
up
dead
trees
and
brush
in
their
front
and
by
placing
artillery
to
cover
the
approaches
and
open
places
smith
and
mccall
deployed
on
each
side
of
the
road
as
well
as
they
could
and
engaged
the
enemy
at
long
range
word
was
sent
back
and
the
advance
of
the
whole
army
was
at
once
commenced
as
we
came
up
we
were
deployed
in
like
manner
i
was
with
the
right
wing
and
led
my
company
through
the
thicket
wherever
a
penetrable
place
could
be
found
taking
advantage
of
any
clear
spot
that
would
carry
me
towards
the
enemy
at
last
i
got
pretty
close
up
without
knowing
it
the
balls
commenced
to
whistle
very
thick
overhead
cutting
the
limbs
of
the
chaparral
right
and
left
we
could
not
see
the
enemy
so
i
ordered
my
men
to
lie
down
an
order
that
did
not
have
to
be
enforced
we
kept
our
position
until
it
became
evident
that
the
enemy
were
not
firing
at
us
and
then
withdrew
to
find
better
ground
to
advance
upon
by
this
time
some
progress
had
been
made
on
our
left
a
section
of
artillery
had
been
captured
by
the
cavalry
and
some
prisoners
had
been
taken
the
mexicans
were
giving
way
all
along
the
line
and
many
of
them
had
no
doubt
left
early
i
at
last
found
a
clear
space
separating
two
ponds
there
seemed
to
be
a
few
men
in
front
and
i
charged
upon
them
with
my
company
there
was
no
resistance
and
we
captured
a
mexican
colonel
who
had
been
wounded
and
a
few
men
just
as
i
was
sending
them
to
the
rear
with
a
guard
of
two
or
three
men
a
private
came
from
the
front
bringing
back
one
of
our
officers
who
had
been
badly
wounded
in
advance
of
where
i
was
the
ground
had
been
charged
over
before
my
exploit
was
equal
to
that
of
the
soldier
who
boasted
that
he
had
cut
off
the
leg
of
one
of
the
enemy
when
asked
why
he
did
not
cut
off
his
head
he
replied
some
one
had
done
that
before
this
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
but
that
the
battle
of
resaca
de
la
palma
would
have
been
won
just
as
it
was
if
i
had
not
been
there
there
was
no
further
resistance
the
evening
of
the
the
army
was
encamped
on
its
old
ground
near
the
fort
and
the
garrison
was
relieved
the
siege
had
lasted
a
number
of
days
but
the
casualties
were
few
in
number
major
jacob
brown
of
the
infantry
the
commanding
officer
had
been
killed
and
in
his
honor
the
fort
was
named
since
then
a
town
of
considerable
importance
has
sprung
up
on
the
ground
occupied
by
the
fort
and
troops
which
has
also
taken
his
name
the
battles
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
seemed
to
us
engaged
as
pretty
important
affairs
but
we
had
only
a
faint
conception
of
their
magnitude
until
they
were
fought
over
in
the
north
by
the
press
and
the
reports
came
back
to
us
at
the
same
time
or
about
the
same
time
we
learned
that
war
existed
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
by
the
acts
of
the
latter
country
on
learning
this
fact
general
taylor
transferred
our
camps
to
the
south
or
west
bank
of
the
river
and
matamoras
was
occupied
we
then
became
the
army
of
invasion
up
to
this
time
taylor
had
none
but
regular
troops
in
his
command
but
now
that
invasion
had
already
taken
place
volunteers
for
one
year
commenced
arriving
the
army
remained
at
matamoras
until
sufficiently
reinforced
to
warrant
a
movement
into
the
interior
general
taylor
was
not
an
officer
to
trouble
the
administration
much
with
his
demands
but
was
inclined
to
do
the
best
he
could
with
the
means
given
him
he
felt
his
responsibility
as
going
no
further
if
he
had
thought
that
he
was
sent
to
perform
an
impossibility
with
the
means
given
him
he
would
probably
have
informed
the
authorities
of
his
opinion
and
left
them
to
determine
what
should
be
done
if
the
judgment
was
against
him
he
would
have
gone
on
and
done
the
best
he
could
with
the
means
at
hand
without
parading
his
grievance
before
the
public
no
soldier
could
face
either
danger
or
responsibility
more
calmly
than
he
these
are
qualities
more
rarely
found
than
genius
or
physical
courage
general
taylor
never
made
any
great
show
or
parade
either
of
uniform
or
retinue
in
dress
he
was
possibly
too
plain
rarely
wearing
anything
in
the
field
to
indicate
his
rank
or
even
that
he
was
an
officer
but
he
was
known
to
every
soldier
in
his
army
and
was
respected
by
all
i
can
call
to
mind
only
one
instance
when
i
saw
him
in
uniform
and
one
other
when
i
heard
of
his
wearing
it
on
both
occasions
he
was
unfortunate
the
first
was
at
corpus
christi
he
had
concluded
to
review
his
army
before
starting
on
the
march
and
gave
orders
accordingly
colonel
twiggs
was
then
second
in
rank
with
the
army
and
to
him
was
given
the
command
of
the
review
colonel
and
brevet
worth
a
far
different
soldier
from
taylor
in
the
use
of
the
uniform
was
next
to
twiggs
in
rank
and
claimed
superiority
by
virtue
of
his
brevet
rank
when
the
accidents
of
service
threw
them
where
one
or
the
other
had
to
command
worth
declined
to
attend
the
review
as
subordinate
to
twiggs
until
the
question
was
settled
by
the
highest
authority
this
broke
up
the
review
and
the
question
was
referred
to
washington
for
final
decision
general
taylor
was
himself
only
a
colonel
in
real
rank
at
that
time
and
a
by
brevet
he
was
assigned
to
duty
however
by
the
president
with
the
rank
which
his
brevet
gave
him
worth
was
not
so
assigned
but
by
virtue
of
commanding
a
division
he
must
under
the
army
regulations
of
that
day
have
drawn
the
pay
of
his
brevet
rank
the
question
was
submitted
to
washington
and
no
response
was
received
until
after
the
army
had
reached
the
rio
grande
it
was
decided
against
general
worth
who
at
once
tendered
his
resignation
and
left
the
army
going
north
no
doubt
by
the
same
vessel
that
carried
it
this
kept
him
out
of
the
battles
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
either
the
resignation
was
not
accepted
or
general
worth
withdrew
it
before
action
had
been
taken
at
all
events
he
returned
to
the
army
in
time
to
command
his
division
in
the
battle
of
monterey
and
served
with
it
to
the
end
of
the
war
the
second
occasion
on
which
general
taylor
was
said
to
have
donned
his
uniform
was
in
order
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
flag
officer
of
the
naval
squadron
off
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
while
the
army
was
on
that
river
the
flag
officer
sent
word
that
he
would
call
on
the
general
to
pay
his
respects
on
a
certain
day
general
taylor
knowing
that
naval
officers
habitually
wore
all
the
uniform
the
law
allowed
on
all
occasions
of
ceremony
thought
it
would
be
only
civil
to
receive
his
guest
in
the
same
style
his
uniform
was
therefore
got
out
brushed
up
and
put
on
in
advance
of
the
visit
the
flag
officer
knowing
general
taylor
aversion
to
the
wearing
of
the
uniform
and
feeling
that
it
would
be
regarded
as
a
compliment
should
he
meet
him
in
dress
left
off
his
uniform
for
this
occasion
the
meeting
was
said
to
have
been
embarrassing
to
both
and
the
conversation
was
principally
apologetic
the
time
was
whiled
away
pleasantly
enough
at
matamoras
while
we
were
waiting
for
volunteers
it
is
probable
that
all
the
most
important
people
of
the
territory
occupied
by
our
army
left
their
homes
before
we
got
there
but
with
those
remaining
the
best
of
relations
apparently
existed
it
was
the
policy
of
the
commanding
general
to
allow
no
pillaging
no
taking
of
private
property
for
public
or
individual
use
without
satisfactory
compensation
so
that
a
better
market
was
afforded
than
the
people
had
ever
known
before
among
the
troops
that
joined
us
at
matamoras
was
an
ohio
regiment
of
which
thomas
hamer
the
member
of
congress
who
had
given
me
my
appointment
to
west
point
was
major
he
told
me
then
that
he
could
have
had
the
colonelcy
but
that
as
he
knew
he
was
to
be
appointed
a
he
preferred
at
first
to
take
the
lower
grade
i
have
said
before
that
hamer
was
one
of
the
ablest
men
ohio
ever
produced
at
that
time
he
was
in
the
prime
of
life
being
less
than
fifty
years
of
age
and
possessed
an
admirable
physique
promising
long
life
but
he
was
taken
sick
before
monterey
and
died
within
a
few
days
i
have
always
believed
that
had
his
life
been
spared
he
would
have
been
president
of
the
united
states
during
the
term
filled
by
president
pierce
had
hamer
filled
that
office
his
partiality
for
me
was
such
there
is
but
little
doubt
i
should
have
been
appointed
to
one
of
the
staff
corps
of
the
army
the
pay
department
probably
and
would
therefore
now
be
preparing
to
retire
neither
of
these
speculations
is
unreasonable
and
they
are
mentioned
to
show
how
little
men
control
their
own
destiny
reinforcements
having
arrived
in
the
month
of
august
the
movement
commenced
from
matamoras
to
camargo
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
rio
grande
the
line
of
the
rio
grande
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
hold
unless
it
was
intended
to
invade
mexico
from
the
north
in
that
case
the
most
natural
route
to
take
was
the
one
which
general
taylor
selected
it
entered
a
pass
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
at
monterey
through
which
the
main
road
runs
to
the
city
of
mexico
monterey
itself
was
a
good
point
to
hold
even
if
the
line
of
the
rio
grande
covered
all
the
territory
we
desired
to
occupy
at
that
time
it
is
built
on
a
plain
two
thousand
feet
above
tide
water
where
the
air
is
bracing
and
the
situation
healthy
on
the
of
august
the
army
started
for
monterey
leaving
a
small
garrison
at
matamoras
the
troops
with
the
exception
of
the
artillery
cavalry
and
the
brigade
to
which
i
belonged
were
moved
up
the
river
to
camargo
on
steamers
as
there
were
but
two
or
three
of
these
the
boats
had
to
make
a
number
of
trips
before
the
last
of
the
troops
were
up
those
who
marched
did
so
by
the
south
side
of
the
river
garland
of
the
infantry
was
the
brigade
commander
and
on
this
occasion
commanded
the
entire
marching
force
one
day
out
convinced
him
that
marching
by
day
in
that
latitude
in
the
month
of
august
was
not
a
beneficial
sanitary
measure
particularly
for
northern
men
the
order
of
marching
was
changed
and
night
marches
were
substituted
with
the
best
results
when
camargo
was
reached
we
found
a
city
of
tents
outside
the
mexican
hamlet
i
was
detailed
to
act
as
quartermaster
and
commissary
to
the
regiment
the
teams
that
had
proven
abundantly
sufficient
to
transport
all
supplies
from
corpus
christi
to
the
rio
grande
over
the
level
prairies
of
texas
were
entirely
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
the
reinforced
army
in
a
mountainous
country
to
obviate
the
deficiency
pack
mules
were
hired
with
mexicans
to
pack
and
drive
them
i
had
charge
of
the
few
wagons
allotted
to
the
infantry
and
of
the
pack
train
to
supplement
them
there
were
not
men
enough
in
the
army
to
manage
that
train
without
the
help
of
mexicans
who
had
learned
how
as
it
was
the
difficulty
was
great
enough
the
troops
would
take
up
their
march
at
an
early
hour
each
day
after
they
had
started
the
tents
and
cooking
utensils
had
to
be
made
into
packages
so
that
they
could
be
lashed
to
the
backs
of
the
mules
kettles
and
mess
chests
were
inconvenient
articles
to
transport
in
that
way
it
took
several
hours
to
get
ready
to
start
each
morning
and
by
the
time
we
were
ready
some
of
the
mules
first
loaded
would
be
tired
of
standing
so
long
with
their
loads
on
their
backs
sometimes
one
would
start
to
run
bowing
his
back
and
kicking
up
until
he
scattered
his
load
others
would
lie
down
and
try
to
disarrange
their
loads
by
attempting
to
get
on
the
top
of
them
by
rolling
on
them
others
with
for
part
of
their
loads
would
manage
to
run
a
on
one
side
of
a
sapling
while
they
would
take
the
other
i
am
not
aware
of
ever
having
used
a
profane
expletive
in
my
life
but
i
would
have
the
charity
to
excuse
those
who
may
have
done
so
if
they
were
in
charge
of
a
train
of
mexican
pack
mules

was
commenced
on
the
of
september
the
army
was
divided
into
four
columns
separated
from
each
other
by
one
march
the
advance
reached
cerralvo
in
four
days
and
halted
for
the
remainder
of
the
troops
to
come
up
by
the
the
had
arrived
and
the
same
day
the
advance
resumed
its
march
followed
as
before
a
day
separating
the
divisions
the
forward
division
halted
again
at
marin
miles
from
monterey
both
this
place
and
cerralvo
were
nearly
deserted
and
men
women
and
children
were
seen
running
and
scattered
over
the
hills
as
we
approached
but
when
the
people
returned
they
found
all
their
abandoned
property
safe
which
must
have
given
them
a
favorable
opinion
of
los

the
yankees
from

the
movement
was
in
mass
on
the
general
taylor
with

army
was
encamped
at
walnut
springs
within
three
miles
of
monterey
the
town
is
on
a
small
stream
coming
out
of
the
and
is
backed
by
a
range
of
hills
of
moderate
elevation
to
the
north
between
the
city
and
walnut
springs
stretches
an
extensive
plain
on
this
plain
and
entirely
outside
of
the
last
houses
of
the
city
stood
a
strong
fort
enclosed
on
all
sides
to
which
our
army
gave
the
name
of
black
fort
its
guns
commanded
the
approaches
to
the
city
to
the
full
extent
of
their
range
there
were
two
detached
spurs
of
hills
or
mountains
to
the
north
and
northwest
of
the
city
which
were
also
fortified
on
one
of
these
stood
the
bishop
palace
the
road
to
saltillo
leaves
the
upper
or
western
end
of
the
city
under
the
fire
of
the
guns
from
these
heights
the
lower
or
eastern
end
was
defended
by
two
or
three
small
detached
works
armed
with
artillery
and
infantry
to
the
south
was
the
mountain
stream
before

and
back
of
that
the
range
of
the
plaza
in
the
centre
of
the
city
was
the
citadel
properly
speaking
all
the
streets
leading
from
it
were
swept
by
artillery
cannon
being
intrenched
behind
temporary
parapets
the
near
the
plaza
were
converted
into
infantry
fortifications
by
the
use
of
for
parapets
such
were
the
defences
of
monterey
in
september
general

with
a
force
of
certainly
ten

at
walnut
springs
while
the
engineer
officers
under
major
mansfield
a
general
in
the
late
war
commenced
their
reconnoissance
major
mansfield
found
that
it
would
be
practicable
to
get
troops
around
out
of
range
of
the
black
fort
and
the
works
on
the
detached
hills
to
the
of
the
city
to
the
saltillo
road
with
this
road
in
our
possession
the
enemy
would
be
cut
off
from
receiving
further
supplies
if
not
from
all
communication
with
the
interior
general
worth
with
his
division
somewhat
reinforced
was
given
the
task
of
gaining
possession
of
the
saltillo
road
and
of
carrying
the
detached
works
outside
the
city
in
that
quarter
he
started
on
his
march
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
the
divisions
under
generals
butler
and
twiggs
were
drawn
up
to
threaten
the
east
and
north
sides
of
the
city
and
the
works
on
those
fronts
in
support
of
the
movement
under
general
worth
worth
was
regarded
as
the
main
attack
on
monterey
and
all
other
operations
were
in
support
of
it
his
march
this
day
was
uninterrupted
but
the
enemy
was
seen
to
reinforce
heavily
about
the
bishop
palace
and
the
other
outside
fortifications
on
their
left
general
worth
reached
a
defensible
position
just
out
of
range
of
the
enemy
guns
on
the
heights
of
the
city
and
bivouacked
for
the
night
the

officers
with
him
captain
sanders
and
lieutenant
george
meade
afterwards
the
commander
of
the
victorious
national
army
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
made
a
reconnoissance
to
the
saltillo
road
under
cover
of
night
during
the
night
of
the
general
taylor
had
established
a
battery
consisting
of
two
howitzers
and
a
ten
inch
mortar
at
a
point
from
which
they
could
play
upon
black
fort
a
natural
depression
in
the
plain
sufficiently
deep
to
protect
men
standing
in
it
from
the
fire
from
the
fort
was
selected
and
the
battery
established
on
the
crest
nearest
the
enemy
the
infantry
then
consisting
of
but
six
reduced
companies
was
ordered
to
support
the
artillerists
while
they
were
intrenching
themselves
and
their
guns
i
was
regimental
quartermaster
at
the
time
and
was
ordered
to
remain
in
charge
of
camp
and
the
public
property
at
walnut
springs
it
was
supposed
that
the
regiment
would
return
to
its
camp
in
the
morning
the
point
for
establishing
the
siege
battery
was
reached
and
the
work
performed
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
enemy
at
daylight
the
next
morning
fire
was
opened
on
both
sides
and
continued
with
what
seemed
to
me
at
that
day
great
fury
my
curiosity
got
the
better
of
my
judgment
and
i
mounted
a
horse
and
rode
to
the
front
to
see
what
was
going
on
i
had
been
there
but
a
short
time
when
an
order
to
charge
was
given
and
lacking
the
moral
courage
to
return
to
camp
where
i
had
been
ordered
to
stay
i
charged
with
the
regiment
as
soon
as
the
troops
were
out
of
the
depression
they
came
under
the
fire
of
black
fort
as
they
advanced
they
got
under
fire
from
batteries
guarding
the
east
or
lower
end
of
the
city
and
of
musketry
about
of
the
men
engaged
in
the
charge
were
killed
or
wounded
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
we
retreated
to
get
out
of
fire
not
backward
but
eastward
and
perpendicular
to
the
direct
road
running
into
the
city
from
walnut
springs
i
was
i
believe
the
only
person
in
the
infantry
in
the
charge
who
was
on
horseback
when
we
got
to
a
lace
of
safety
the
regiment
halted
and
drew
itself
together
what
was
left
of
it
the
adjutant
of
the
regiment
lieutenant
hoskins
who
was
not
in
robust
health
found
himself
very
much
fatigued
from
running
on
foot
in
the
charge
and
retreat
and
seeing
me
on
horseback
expressed
a
wish
that
he
could
be
mounted
also
i
offered
him
my
horse
and
he
accepted
the
offer
a
few
minutes
later
i
saw
a
soldier
a
quartermaster
man
mounted
not
far
away
i
ran
to
him
took
his
horse
and
was
back
with
the
regiment
in
a
few
minutes
in
a
short
time
we
were
off
again
and
the
next
place
of
safety
from
the
shots
of
the
enemy
that
i
recollect
of
being
in
was
a
field
of
cane
or
corn
to
the
of
the
lower
batteries
the
adjutant
to
whom
i
had
loaned
my
horse
was
killed
and
i
was
designated
to
act
in
his
place
this
charge
was
or
badly
executed
we
belonged
to
the
brigade
commanded
by
garland
and
he
had
received
orders
to
charge
the
lower
batteries
of
the
city
and
carry
them
if
he
could
without
too
much
loss
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
diversion
in
favor
of
worth
who
was
conducting
the
movement
which
it
was
intended
should
be
decisive
by
a
movement
by
the
left
flank
garland
could
have
led
his
men
beyond
the
range
of
the
fire
from
black
fort
and
advanced
towards
the
northeast
angle
of
the
city
as
well
covered
from
fire
as
could
be
expected
there
was
no
undue
loss
of
life
in
reaching
the
lower
end
of
monterey
except
that
sustained
by
garland
command
meanwhile
quitman
brigade
conducted
by
an
officer
of
engineers
had
reached
the
eastern
end
of
the
city
and
was
placed
under
cover
of
the
houses
without
much
loss
colonel
garland
brigade
also
arrived
at
the
suburbs
and
by
the
assistance
of
some
of
our
troops
that
had
reached
from
which
they
could
fire
into
a
little
battery
covering
the
approaches
to
the
lower
end
of
the
city
the
battery
was
speedily
captured
and
its
guns
were
turned
upon
another
work
of
the
enemy
an
entrance
into
the
east
end
of
the
city
was
now
secured
and
the
houses
protected
our
troops
so
long
as
they
were
inactive
on
the
west
general
worth
had
reached
the
saltillo
road
after
some
fighting
but
without
heavy
loss
he
turned
from
his
new
position
and
captured
the
forts
on
both
heights
in
that
quarter
this
gave
him
possession
of
the
upper
or
west
end
of
monterey
troops
from
both
twiggs
and
butler
divisions
were
in
possession
of
the
east
end
of
the
town
but
the
black
fort
to
the
north
of
the
town
and
the
plaza
in
the
centre
were
still
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
our
camps
at
walnut
springs
three
miles
away
were
guarded
by
a
company
from
each
regiment
a
regiment
of
kentucky
volunteers
guarded
the
mortars
and
howitzers
engaged
against
black
fort
practically
monterey
was
invested
there
was
nothing
done
on
the
by
the
united
states
troops
but
the
enemy
kept
up
a
harmless
fire
upon
us
from
black
fort
and
the
batteries
still
in
their
possession
at
the
east
end
of
the
city
during
the
night
they
evacuated
these
so
that
on
the
morning
of
the
we
held
undisputed
possession
of
the
east
end
of
monterey
twiggs
division
was
at
the
lower
end
of
the
city
and
well
covered
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
but
the
streets
leading
to
the
plaza
all
spanish
or
towns
have
near
their
centres
a
square
called
a
plaza
were
commanded
from
all
directions
by
artillery
the
houses
were
and
but
one
or
two
stories
high
and
about
the
plaza
the
roofs
were
manned
with
infantry
the
troops
being
protected
from
our
fire
by
parapets
made
of
all
advances
into
the
city
were
thus
attended
with
much
danger
while
moving
along
streets
which
did
not
lead
to
the
plaza
our
men
were
protected
from
the
fire
and
from
the
view
of
the
enemy
except
at
the
crossings
but
at
these
a
volley
of
musketry
and
a
discharge
of
were
invariably
encountered
the
and
regiments
of
infantry
made
an
advance
nearly
to
the
plaza
in
this
way
and
with
heavy
loss
the
loss
of
the
infantry
in
commissioned
officers
was
especially
severe
there
were
only
five
companies
of
the
regiment
and
not
over
twelve
officers
present
and
five
of
these
officers
were
killed
when
within
a
square
of
the
plaza
this
small
command
ten
companies
in
all
was
brought
to
a
halt
placing
themselves
under
cover
from
the
shots
of
the
enemy
the
men
would
watch
to
detect
a
head
above
the
on
the
neighboring
houses
the
exposure
of
a
single
head
would
bring
a
volley
from
our
soldiers
we
had
not
occupied
this
position
long
when
it
was
discovered
that
our
ammunition
was
growing
low
i
volunteered
to
go
back
to
the
point
we
had
started
from
report
our
position
to
general
twiggs
and
ask
for
ammunition
to
be
forwarded
we
were
at
this
time
occupying
ground
off
from
the
street
in
rear
of
the
houses
my
ride
back
was
an
exposed
one
before
starting
i
adjusted
myself
on
the
side
of
my
horse
furthest
from
the
enemy
and
with
only
one
foot
holding
to
the
cantle
of
the
saddle
and
an
arm
over
the
neck
of
the
horse
exposed
i
started
at
full
run
it
was
only
at
street
crossings
that
my
horse
was
under
fire
but
these
i
crossed
at
such
a
flying
rate
that
generally
i
was
past
and
under
cover
of
the
next
block
of
houses
before
the
enemy
fired
i
got
out
safely
without
a
scratch
at
one
place
on
my
ride
i
saw
a
sentry
walking
in
front
of
a
house
and
stopped
to
inquire
what
he
was
doing
there
finding
that
the
house
was
full
of
wounded
american
officers
and
soldiers
i
dismounted
and
went
in
i
found
there
captain
williams
of
the
engineer
corps
wounded
in
the
head
probably
fatally
and
lieutenant
territt
also
badly
wounded
his
bowels
protruding
from
his
wound
there
were
quite
a
number
of
soldiers
also
promising
them
to
report
their
situation
i
left
readjusted
myself
to
my
horse
recommenced
the
run
and
was
soon
with
the
troops
at
the
east
end
before
ammunition
could
be
collected
the
two
regiments
i
had
been
with
were
seen
returning
running
the
same
gauntlet
in
getting
out
that
they
had
passed
in
going
in
but
with
comparatively
little
loss
the
movement
was
countermanded
and
the
troops
were
withdrawn
the
poor
wounded
officers
and
men
i
had
found
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
during
the
night
and
died
while
this
was
going
on
at
the
east
general
worth
with
a
small
division
of
troops
was
advancing
towards
the
plaza
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
city
he
resorted
to
a
better
expedient
for
getting
to
the
plaza
the
citadel
than
we
did
on
the
east
instead
of
moving
by
the
open
streets
he
advanced
through
the
houses
cutting
passageways
from
one
to
another
without
much
loss
of
life
he
got
so
near

plaza
during
the
night
that
before
morning
ampudia
the
mexican
commander
made
overtures
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
and
garrison
this
stopped
all
further
hostilities
the
terms
of
surrender
were
soon
agreed
upon
the
prisoners
were
paroled
and
permitted
to
take
their
horses
and
personal
property
with
them
my
pity
was
aroused
by
the
sight
of
the
mexican
garrison
of
monterey
marching
out
of
town
as
prisoners
and
no
doubt
the
same
feeling
was
experienced
by
most
of
our
army
who
witnessed
it
many
of
the
prisoners
were
cavalry
armed
with
lances
and
mounted
on
miserable
little
horses
that
did
not
look
as
if
they
could
carry
their
riders
out
of
town
the
men
looked
in
but
little
better
condition
i
thought
how
little
interest
the
men
before
me
had
in
the
results
of
the
war
and
how
little
knowledge
they
had
of
what
it
was
all
about
after
the
surrender
of
the
garrison
of
monterey
a
quiet
camp

had

departure

had
regretted

and

were

protected

a

was
afforded
for

as
the
people
had
never
enjoyed
before
the
educated
and
wealthy
portion
of
the
population
here
as
elsewhere
abandoned
their
homes
and
remained
away
from
them
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
possession
of

siege

of

the
mexican
war
was
a
political
war
and
the
administration
conducting
it
desired
to
make
party
capital
out
of
it
general
scott
was
at
the
head
of
the
army
and
being
a
soldier
of
acknowledged
professional
capacity
his
claim
to
the
command
of
the
forces
in
the
field
was
almost
indisputable
and
does
not
seem
to
have
been
denied
by
president
polk
or
marcy
his
secretary
of
war
scott
was
a
whig
and
the
administration
was
democratic
general
scott
was
also
known
to
have
political
aspirations
and
nothing
so
popularizes
a
candidate
for
high
civil
positions
as
military
victories
it
would
not
do
therefore
to
give
him
command
of
the
army
of
conquest
the
plans
submitted
by
scott
for
a
campaign
in
mexico
were
disapproved
by
the
administration
and
he
replied
in
a
tone
possibly
a
little
disrespectful
to
the
effect
that
if
a
soldier
plans
were
not
to
be
supported
by
the
administration
success
could
not
be
expected
this
was
on
the
of
may
four
days
later
general
scott
was
notified
that
he
need
not
go
to
mexico
general
gaines
was
next
in
rank
but
he
was
too
old
and
feeble
to
take
the
field
colonel
zachary
taylor
a
by
brevet
was
therefore
left
in
command
he
too
was
a
whig
but
was
not
supposed
to
entertain
any
political
ambitions
nor
did
he
but
after
the
fall
of
monterey
his
third
battle
and
third
complete
victory
the
whig
papers
at
home
began
to
speak
of
him
as
the
candidate
of
their
party
for
the
presidency
something
had
to
be
done
to
neutralize
his
growing
popularity
he
could
not
be
relieved
from
duty
in
the
field
where
all
his
battles
had
been
victories
the
design
would
have
been
too
transparent
it
was
finally
decided
to
send
general
scott
to
mexico
in
chief
command
and
to
authorize
him
to
carry
out
his
own
original
plan
that
is
capture
vera
cruz
and
march
upon
the
capital
of
the
country
it
was
no
doubt
supposed
that
scott
ambition
would
lead
him
to
slaughter
taylor
or
destroy
his
chances
for
the
presidency
and
yet
it
was
hoped
that
he
would
not
make
sufficient
capital
himself
to
secure
the
prize
the
administration
had
indeed
a
most
embarrassing
problem
to
solve
it
was
engaged
in
a
war
of
conquest
which
must
be
carried
to
a
successful
issue
or
the
political
object
would
be
unattained
yet
all
the
capable
officers
of
the
requisite
rank
belonged
to
the
opposition
and
the
man
selected
for
his
lack
of
political
ambition
had
himself
become
a
prominent
candidate
for
the
presidency
it
was
necessary
to
destroy
his
chances
promptly
the
problem
was
to
do
this
without
the
loss
of
conquest
and
without
permitting
another
general
of
the
same
political
party
to
acquire
like
popularity
the
fact
is
the
administration
of
polk
made
every
preparation
to
disgrace
scott
or
to
speak
more
correctly
to
drive
him
to
such
desperation
that
he
would
disgrace
himself
general
scott
had
opposed
conquest
by
the
way
of
the
rio
grande
matamoras
and
saltillo
from
the
first
now
that
he
was
in
command
of
all
the
forces
in
mexico
he
withdrew
from
taylor
most
of
his
regular
troops
and
left
him
only
enough
volunteers
as
he
thought
to
hold
the
line
then
in
possession
of
the
invading
army
indeed
scott
did
not
deem
it
important
to
hold
anything
beyond
the
rio
grande
and
authorized
taylor
to
fall
back
to
that
line
if
he
chose
general
taylor
protested
against
the
depletion
of
his
army
and
his
subsequent
movement
upon
buena
vista
would
indicate
that
he
did
not
share
the
views
of
his
chief
in
regard
to
the
unimportance
of
conquest
beyond
the
rio
grande
scott
had
estimated
the
men
and
material
that
would
be
required
to
capture
vera
cruz
and
to
march
on
the
capital
of
the
country
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
in
the
interior
he
was
promised
all
he
asked
and
seemed
to
have
not
only
the
confidence
of
the
president
but
his
sincere
good
wishes
the
promises
were
all
broken
only
about
half
the
troops
were
furnished
that
had
been
pledged
other
war
material
was
withheld
and
scott
had
scarcely
started
for
mexico
before
the
president
undertook
to
supersede
him
by
the
appointment
of
senator
thomas
benton
as
this
being
refused
by
congress
the
president
asked
legislative
authority
to
place
a
junior
over
a
senior
of
the
same
grade
with
the
view
of
appointing
benton
to
the
rank
of
and
then
placing
him
in
command
of
the
army
but
congress
failed
to
accede
to
this
proposition
as
well
and
scott
remained
in
command
but
every
general
appointed
to
serve
under
him
was
politically
opposed
to
the
chief
and
several
were
personally
hostile
general
scott
reached
brazos
santiago
or
point
isabel
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
late
in
december
and
proceeded
at
once
up
the
river
to
camargo
where
he
had
written
general
taylor
to
meet
him
taylor
however
had
gone
to
or
towards
tampico
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
post
there
he
had
started
on
this
march
before
he
was
aware
of
general
scott
being
in
the
country
under
these
circumstances
scott
had
to
issue
his
orders
designating
the
troops
to
be
withdrawn
from
taylor
without
the
personal
consultation
he
had
expected
to
hold
with
his
subordinate
general
taylor
victory
at
buena
vista
february
and
with
an
army
composed
almost
entirely
of
volunteers
who
had
not
been
in
battle
before
and
over
a
vastly
superior
force
numerically
made
his
nomination
for
the
presidency
by
the
whigs
a
foregone
conclusion
he
was
nominated
and
elected
in
i
believe
that
he
sincerely
regretted
this
turn
in
his
fortunes
preferring
the
peace
afforded
by
a
quiet
life
free
from
abuse
to
the
honor
of
filling
the
highest
office
in
the
gift
of
any
people
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
when
general
scott
assumed
command
of
the
army
of
invasion
i
was
in
the
division
of
general
david
twiggs
in
taylor
command
but
under
the
new
orders
my
regiment
was
transferred
to
the
division
of
general
william
worth
in
which
i
served
to
the
close
of
the
war
the
troops
withdrawn
from
taylor
to
form
part
of
the
forces
to
operate
against
vera
cruz
were
assembled
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
preparatory
to
embarkation
for
their
destination
i
found
general
worth
a
different
man
from
any
i
had
before
served
directly
under
he
was
nervous
impatient
and
restless
on
the
march
or
when
important
or
responsible
duty
confronted
him
there
was
not
the
least
reason
for
haste
on
the
march
for
it
was
known
that
it
would
take
weeks
to
assemble
shipping
enough
at
the
point
of
our
embarkation
to
carry
the
army
but
general
worth
moved
his
division
with
a
rapidity
that
would
have
been
commendable
had
he
been
going
to
the
relief
of
a
beleaguered
garrison
the
length
of
the
marches
was
regulated
by
the
distances
between
places
affording
a
supply
of
water
for
the
troops
and
these
distances
were
sometimes
long
and
sometimes
short
general
worth
on
one
occasion
at
least
after
having
made
the
full
distance
intended
for
the
day
and
after
the
troops
were
in
camp
and
preparing
their
food
ordered
tents
struck
and
made
the
march
that
night
which
had
been
intended
for
the
next
day
some
commanders
can
move
troops
so
as
to
get
the
maximum
distance
out
of
them
without
fatigue
while
others
can
wear
them
out
in
a
few
days
without
accomplishing
so
much
general
worth
belonged
to
this
latter
class
he
enjoyed
however
a
fine
reputation
for
his
fighting
qualities
and
thus
attached
his
officers
and
men
to
him
the
army
lay
in
camp
upon
the
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
for
several
weeks
awaiting
the
arrival
of
transports
to
carry
it
to
its
new
field
of
operations
the
transports
were
all
sailing
vessels
the
passage
was
a
tedious
one
and
many
of
the
troops
were
on
shipboard
over
thirty
days
from
the
embarkation
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
to
the
time
of
debarkation
south
of
vera
cruz
the
trip
was
a
comfortless
one
for
officers
and
men
the
transports
used
were
built
for
carrying
freight
and
possessed
but
limited
accommodations
for
passengers
and
the
climate
added
to
the
discomfort
of
all
the
transports
with
troops
were
assembled
in
the
harbor
of
anton
lizardo
some
sixteen
miles
south
of
vera
cruz
as
they
arrived
and
there
awaited
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
bringing
artillery
ammunition
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
from
the
north
with
the
fleet
there
was
a
little
steam
propeller
the
first
vessel
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
probably
the
first
of
its
kind
ever
seen
by
any
one
then
with
the
army
at
that
day
ocean
steamers
were
rare
and
what
there
were
were
sidewheelers
this
little
vessel
going
through
the
fleet
so
fast
so
noiselessly
and
with
its
propeller
under
water
out
of
view
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
i
recollect
that
lieutenant
sidney
smith
of
the
infantry
by
whom
i
happened
to
be
standing
on
the
deck
of
a
vessel
when
this
propeller
was
passing
exclaimed
why
the
thing
looks
as
if
it
was
propelled
by
the
force
of
circumstances
finally
on
the
of
march
the
little
army
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
men
given
scott
to
invade
a
country
with
a
population
of
seven
or
eight
millions
a
mountainous
country
affording
the
greatest
possible
natural
advantages
for
defence
was
all
assembled
and
ready
to
commence
the
perilous
task
of
landing
from
vessels
lying
in
the
open
sea
the
debarkation
took
place
inside
of
the
little
island
of
sacrificios
some
three
miles
south
of
vera
cruz
the
vessels
could
not
get
anywhere
near
shore
so
that
everything
had
to
be
landed
in
lighters
or
general
scott
had
provided
these
before
leaving
the
north
the
breakers
were
sometimes
high
so
that
the
landing
was
tedious
the
men
were
got
ashore
rapidly
because
they
could
wade
when
they
came
to
shallow
water
but
the
camp
and
garrison
equipage
provisions
ammunition
and
all
stores
had
to
be
protected
from
the
salt
water
and
therefore
their
landing
took
several
days
the
mexicans
were
very
kind
to
us
however
and
threw
no
obstacles
in
the
way
of
our
landing
except
an
occasional
shot
from
their
nearest
fort
during
the
debarkation
one
shot
took
off
the
head
of
major
albertis
no
other
i
believe
reached
anywhere
near
the
same
distance
on
the
of
march
the
troops
were
landed
and
the
investment
of
vera
cruz
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
south
of
the
city
to
the
gulf
again
on
the
north
was
soon
and
easily
effected
the
landing
of
stores
was
continued
until
everything
was
got
ashore
vera
cruz
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
and
up
to
was
a
walled
city
the
wall
extended
from
the
water
edge
south
of
the
town
to
the
water
again
on
the
north
there
were
fortifications
at
intervals
along
the
line
and
at
the
angles
in
front
of
the
city
and
on
an
island
half
a
mile
out
in
the
gulf

san

de
ulloa
an
enclosed
fortification
of
large
dimensions
and
great
strength
for
that
period
against
artillery
of
the
present
day
the
land
forts
and
walls
would
prove
elements
of
weakness
rather
than
strength
after
the
invading
army
had
established
their
camps
out
of
range
of
the
fire
from
the
city
batteries
were
established
under
cover
of
night
far
to
the
front
of
the
line
where
the
troops
lay
these
batteries
were
intrenched
and
the
approaches
sufficiently
protected
if
a
sortie
had
been
made
at
any
time
by
the
mexicans
the
men
serving
the
batteries
could
have
been
quickly
reinforced
without
great
exposure
to
the
fire
from
the
main
line
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
capture
the
batteries
or
to
drive
our
troops
away
the
siege
continued
with
brisk
firing
on
our
side
till
the
of
march
by
which
time
a
considerable
breach
had
been
made
in
the
wall
surrounding
the
city
upon
this
general
morales
who
was
governor
of
both
the
city
and
of
san

commenced
a
correspondence
with

scott
looking
to
the
surrender
of
the
town
forts
and
garrison
on
the
vera

and
san

were
occupied
by
army
about
five
thousand
prisoners
and
four
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
besides
large
amounts
of
small
arms
and
ammunition
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victorious
force
the
casualties
on
our
side
during
the
siege
amounted
to
officers
and

killed

scott
and

general
scott
had
less
than
twelve
thousand
men
at
vera
cruz
he
had
been
promised
by
the
administration
a
very
much
larger
force
or
claimed
that
he
had
and
he
was
a
man
of
veracity
twelve
thousand
was
a
very
small
army
with
which
to
penetrate
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
into
an
enemy
country
and
to
besiege
the
capital
a
city
at
that
time
of
largely
over
one
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
then
too
any
line
of
march
that
could
be
selected
led
through
mountain
passes
easily
defended
in
fact
there
were
at
that
time
but
two
roads
from
vera
cruz
to
the
city
of
mexico
that
could
be
taken
by
an
army
one
by
jalapa
and
perote
the
other
by
cordova
and
orizaba
the
two
coming
together
on
the
great
plain
which
extends
to
the
city
of
mexico
after
the
range
of
mountains
is
passed
it
was
very
important
to
get
the
army
away
from
vera
cruz
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
avoid
the
yellow
fever
or
vomito
which
usually
visits
that
city
early
in
the
year
and
is
very
fatal
to
persons
not
acclimated
but
transportation
which
was
expected
from
the
north
was
arriving
very
slowly
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
have
enough
to
supply
the
army
to
jalapa
miles
in
the
interior
and
above
the
fevers
of
the
coast
at
that
point
the
country
is
fertile
and
an
army
of
the
size
of
general
scott
could
subsist
there
for
an
indefinite
period
not
counting
the
sick
the
weak
and
the
garrisons
for
the
captured
city
and
fort
the
moving
column
was
now
less
than
ten

strong
this
force
was
composed
of

the
importance
of
escaping
the
vomito
was
so
great
that
as
soon
as
transportation
enough
could
be
got
together
to
move
a
division
the
advance
was
commenced
on
the
of
april
twiggs
division
started
for
jalapa
he
was
followed
very
soon
by
patterson
with
his
division
general
worth
was
to
bring
up
the
rear
with
his
command
as
soon
as
transportation
enough
was
assembled
to
carry
six
days
rations
for
his
troops
with
the
necessary
ammunition
and
camp
and
garrison
equipage
it
was
the
of
april
before
this
division
left
vera
cruz
the
leading
division
ran
against
the
enemy
at
cerro
gordo
some
fifty
miles
west
on
the
road
to
jalapa
and
went
into
camp
at
plan
del
rio
about
three
miles
from
the
fortifications
general
patterson
reached
plan
del
rio
with
his
division
soon
after
twiggs
arrived
the
two
were
then
secure
against
an
attack
from
santa
anna
who
commanded
the
mexican
forces
at
all
events
they
confronted
the
enemy
without
reinforcements
and
without
molestation
until
the
of
april
general
scott
had
remained
at
vera
cruz
to
hasten
preparations
for
the
field
but
on
the
learning
the
situation
at
the
front
he
hastened
on
to
take
personal
supervision
he
at
once
commenced
his
preparations
for
the
capture
of
the
position
held
by
santa
anna
and
of
the
troops
holding
it
cerro
gordo
is
one
of
the
higher
spurs
of
the
mountains
some
twelve
to
fifteen
miles
east
of
jalapa
and
santa
anna
had
selected
this
point
as
the
easiest
to
defend
against
an
invading
army
the
road
said
to
have
been
built
by
cortez
zigzags
around
the
and
was
defended
at
every
turn
by
artillery
on
either
side
were
deep
chasms
or
mountain
walls
a
direct
attack
along
the
road
was
an
impossibility
a
flank
movement
seemed
equally
impossible
after
the
arrival
of
the
upon
the
scene
reconnoissances
were
sent
out
to
find
or
to
make
a
road
by
which
the
rear
of
the
enemy
works
might
be
reached
without
a
front
attack
these
reconnoissances
were
made
under
the
supervision
of
captain
robert
lee
assisted
by
lieutenants
beauregard
isaac
stevens
z
b
tower
smith
george
mcclellan
and
foster
of
the
corps
of
engineers
all
officers
who
attained
rank
and
fame
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
great
conflict
for
the
preservation
of
the
unity
of
the
nation
the
reconnoissance
was
completed
and
the
labor
of
cutting
out
and
making
roads
by
the
flank
of
the
enemy
was
effected
by
the
of
the
month
this
was
accomplished
without
the
knowledge
of
santa
anna
or
his
army
and
over
ground
where
he
supposed
it
impossible
on
the
same
day
general
scott
issued
his
order
for
the
attack
on
the
the
attack
was
made
as
ordered
and
perhaps
there
was
not
a
battle
of
the
mexican
war
or
of
any
other
where
orders
issued
before
an
engagement
were
nearer
being
a
correct
report
of
what
afterwards
took
place
under
the
supervision
of
the
engineers
roadways
had
been
opened
over
chasms
to
the
right
where
the
walls
were
so
steep
that
men
could
barely
climb
them
animals
could
not
these
had
been
opened
under
cover
of
night
without
attracting
the
notice
of
the
enemy
the
engineers
who
had
directed
the
opening
led
the
way
and
the
troops
followed
artillery
was
let
down
the
steep
slopes
by
hand
the
men
engaged
attaching
a
strong
rope
to
the
rear
axle
and
letting
the
guns
down
a
piece
at
a
time
while
the
men
at
the
ropes
kept
their
ground
on
top
paying
out
gradually
while
a
few
at
the
front
directed
the
course
of
the
piece
in
like
manner
the
guns
were
drawn
by
hand
up
the
opposite
slopes
in
this
way
scott
troops
reached
their
assigned
position
in
rear
of
most
of
the
intrenchments
of
the
enemy
unobserved
the
attack
was
made
the
mexican
reserves
behind
the
works
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
those
occupying
them
surrendered
on
the
left
general
pillow
command
made
a
formidable
demonstration
which
doubtless
held
a
part
of
the
enemy
in
his
front
and
contributed
to
the
victory
i
am
not
pretending
to
give
full
details
of
all
the
battles
fought
but
of
the
portion
that
i
saw
there
were
troops
engaged
on
both
sides
at
other
points
in
which
both
sustained
losses
but
the
battle
was
won
as
here
narrated
the
surprise
of
the
enemy
was
complete
the
victory
overwhelming
some
three
thousand
prisoners
fell
into
scott
hands
also
a
large
amount
of
ordnance
and
ordnance
stores
the
prisoners
were
paroled
the
artillery
parked
and
the
small
arms
and
ammunition
destroyed
the
battle
of
buena
vista
was
probably
very
important
to
the
success
of
general
scott
at
cerro
gordo
and
in
his
entire
campaign
from
vera
cruz
to
the
great
plains
reaching
to
the
city
of
mexico
the
only
army
santa
anna
had
to
protect
his
capital
and
the
mountain
passes
west
of
vera
cruz
was
the
one
he
had
with
him
confronting
general
taylor
it
is
not
likely
that
he
would
have
gone
as
far
north
as
monterey
to
attack
the
united
states
troops
when
he
knew
his
country
was
threatened
with
invasion
further
south
when
taylor
moved
to
saltillo
and
then
advanced
on
to
buena
vista
santa
anna
crossed
the
desert
confronting
the
invading
army
hoping
no
doubt
to
crush
it
and
get
back
in
time
to
meet
general
scott
in
the
mountain
passes
west
of
vera
cruz
his
attack
on
taylor
was
disastrous
to
the
mexican
army
but
notwithstanding
this
he
marched
his
army
to
cerro
gordo
a
distance
not
much
short
of
one
thousand
miles
by
the
line
he
had
to
travel
in
time
to
intrench
himself
well
before
scott
got
there
if
he
had
been
successful
at
buena
vista
his
troops
would
no
doubt
have
made
a
more
stubborn
resistance
at
cerro
gordo
had
the
battle
of
buena
vista
not
been
fought
santa
anna
would
have
had
time
to
move
leisurely
to
meet
the
invader
further
south
and
with
an
army
not
demoralized
nor
depleted
by
defeat
after
the
battle
the
victorious
army
moved
on
to
jalapa
where
it
was
in
a
beautiful
productive
and
healthy
country
far
above
the
fevers
of
the
coast
jalapa
however
is
still
in
the
mountains
and
between
there
and
the
great
plain
the
whole
line
of
the
road
is
easy
of
defence
it
was
important
therefore
to
get
possession
of
the
great
highway
between
the
and
the
capital
up
to
the
point
where
it
leaves
the
mountains
before
the
enemy
could
have
time
to
and
fortify
in
our
front
worth
division
was
selected
to
go
forward
to
secure
this
result
the
division
marched
to
perote
on
the
great
plain
not
far
from
where
the
road
debouches
from
the
mountains
there
is
a
low
strong
fort
on
the
plain
in
front
of
the
town
known
as
the
castle
of
perote
this
however
offered
no
resistance
and
fell
into
our
hands
with
its
armament
general
scott
having
now
only
nine
or
ten
thousand
men
west
of
vera
cruz
and
the
time
of
some
four
thousand
of
them
being
about
to
expire
a
long
delay
was
the
consequence
the
troops
were
in
a
healthy
climate
and
where
they
could
subsist
for
an
indefinite
period
even
if
their
line
back
to
vera
cruz
should
be
cut
off
it
being
ascertained
that
the
men
whose
time
would
expire
before
the
city
of
mexico
could
possibly
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
american
army
would
not
remain
beyond
the
term
for
which
they
had
volunteered
the
determined
to
discharge
them
at
once
for
a
delay
until
the
expiration
of
their
time
would
have
compelled
them
to
pass
through
vera
cruz
during
the
season
of
the
vomito
this
reduced
scott
force
in
the
field
to
about
five
thousand
men
early
in
may
worth
with
his
division
left
perote
and
marched
on
to
puebla
the
roads
were
wide
and
the
country
open
except
through
one
pass
in
a
spur
of
mountains
coming
up
from
the
south
through
which
the
road
runs
notwithstanding
this
the
small
column
was
divided
into
two
bodies
moving
a
day
apart
nothing
occurred
on
the
march
of
special
note
except
that
while
lying
at
the
town
of
amozoque
an
easy
march
east
of
puebla
a
body
of
the
enemy
cavalry
two
or
three
thousand
strong
was
seen
to
our
right
not
more
than
a
mile
away
a
battery
or
two
with
two
or
three
infantry
regiments
was
sent
against
them
and
they
soon
disappeared
on
the
of
may
we
entered
the
city
of
puebla
general
worth
was
in
command
at
puebla
until
the
latter
end
of
may
when
general
scott
arrived
here
as
well
as
on
the
march
up
his
restlessness
particularly
under
responsibilities
showed
itself
during
his
brief
command
he
had
the
enemy
hovering
around
near
the
city
in
vastly
superior
numbers
to
his
own
the
brigade
to
which
i
was
attached
changed
quarters
three
different
times
in
about
a
week
occupying
at
first
quarters
near
the
plaza
in
the
heart
of
the
city
then
at
the
western
entrance
then
at
the
extreme
east
on
one
occasion
general
worth
had
the
troops
in
line
under
arms
all
day
with
three
days
cooked
rations
in
their
haversacks
he
galloped
from
one
command
to
another
proclaiming
the
near
proximity
of
santa
anna
with
an
army
vastly
superior
to
his
own
general
scott
arrived
upon
the
scene
the
latter
part
of
the
month
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
santa
anna
and
his
myriads
there
were
of
course
bodies
of
mounted
mexicans
hovering
around
to
watch
our
movements
and
to
pick
up
stragglers
or
small
bodies
of
troops
if
they
ventured
too
far
out
these
always
withdrew
on
the
approach
of
any
considerable
number
of
our
soldiers
after
the
arrival
of
general
scott
i
was
sent
as
quartermaster
with
a
large
train
of
wagons
back
two
days
march
at
least
to
procure
forage
we
had
less
than
a
thousand
men
as
escort
and
never
thought
of
danger
we
procured
full
loads
for
our
entire
train
at
two
plantations
which
could
easily
have
furnished
as
much
more
there
had
been
great
delay
in
obtaining
the
authority
of
congress
for
the
raising
of
the
troops
asked
for
by
the
administration
a
bill
was
before
the
national
legislature
from
early
in
the
session
of
authorizing
the
creation
of
ten
additional
regiments
for
the
war
to
be
attached
to
the
regular
army
but
it
was
the
middle
of
february
before
it
became
a
law
appointments
of
commissioned
officers
had
then
to
be
made
men
had
to
be
enlisted
the
regiments
equipped
and
the
whole
transported
to
mexico
it
was
august
before
general
scott
received
reinforcement
sufficient
to
warrant
an
advance
his
moving
column
not
even
now
more
than
ten
thousand
strong
was
in
four
divisions
commanded
by
generals
twiggs
worth
pillow
and
quitman
there
was
also
a
cavalry
corps
under
general
harney
composed
of
detachments
of
the
and
dragoons
the
advance
commenced
on
the
of
august
with
division
in
front
the
remaining
three
divisions
followed
with
an
interval
of
a
day
between
the
marches
were
short
to
make
concentration
easier
in
case
of
attack
i
had
now
been
in
battle
with
the
two
leading
commanders
conducting
armies
in
a
foreign
land
the
contrast
between
the
two
was
very
marked
general
taylor
never
wore
uniform
but
dressed
himself
entirely
for
comfort
he
moved
about
the
field
in
which
he
was
operating
to
see
through
his
own
eyes
the
situation
often
he
would
be
without
staff
officers
and
when
he
was
accompanied
by
them
there
was
no
prescribed
order
in
which
they
followed
he
was
very
much
given
to
sit
his
horse
with
both
feet
on
one
side
particularly
on
the
battlefield
general
scott
was
the
reverse
in
all
these
particulars
he
always
wore
all
the
uniform
prescribed
or
allowed
by
law
when
he
inspected
his
lines
word
would
be
sent
to
all
division
and
brigade
commanders
in
advance
notifying
them
of
the
hour
when
the
commanding
general
might
be
expected
this
was
done
so
that
all
the
army
might
be
under
arms
to
salute
their
chief
as
he
passed
on
these
occasions
he
wore
his
dress
uniform
cocked
hat
aiguillettes
sabre
and
spurs
his
staff
proper
besides
all
officers
constructively
on
his
staff
engineers
inspectors
quartermasters
that
could
be
spared
followed
also
in
uniform
and
in
prescribed
order
orders
were
prepared
with
great
care
and
evidently
with
the
view
that
they
should
be
a
history
of
what
followed
in
their
modes
of
expressing
thought
these
two
generals
contrasted
quite
as
strongly
as
in
their
other
characteristics
general
scott
was
precise
in
language
cultivated
a
style
peculiarly
his
own
was
proud
of
his
rhetoric
not
averse
to
speaking
of
himself
often
in
the
third
person
and
he
could
bestow
praise
upon
the
person
he
was
talking
about
without
the
least
embarrassment
taylor
was
not
a
conversationalist
but
on
paper
he
could
put
his
meaning
so
plainly
that
there
could
be
no
mistaking
it
he
knew
how
to
express
what
he
wanted
to
say
in
the
fewest
words
but
would
not
sacrifice
meaning
to
the
construction
of
sentences
but
with
their
opposite
characteristics
both
were
great
and
successful
soldiers
both
were
true
patriotic
and
upright
in
all
their
dealings
both
were
pleasant
to
serve
under
taylor
was
pleasant
to
serve
with
scott
saw
more
through
the
eyes
of
his
staff
officers
than
through
his
own
his
plans
were
deliberately
prepared
and
fully
expressed
in
orders
taylor
saw
for
himself
and
gave
orders
to
meet
the
emergency
without
reference
to
how
they
would
read
in
history

the

at

about
eleven
thousand

above

the

through
this

might
have
been
easily
defended
but
it
was
not

still
nearer

between
the

chalco

are
divided
by
a
narrow
strip
of
land
over
which
the
direct

to

runs
xochimilco
is
also
to
the
left
of

but
at
a
considerable
distance
south
of
it
and
is
connected
with

by
a
narrow

there
is
a

rocky
mound
called
el
penon
on
the
right
of
the
road
springing
up
from
the
low
flat
ground
dividing
the
lakes
this
mound
was
strengthened
by
intrenchments
at
its
base
and
summit
and
rendered
a
direct
attack
impracticable
scott
army
was
rapidly
concentrated
about
ayotla
and
other
points
near
the
eastern
end
of
lake
chalco
reconnoissances
were
made
up
to
within
of

while
engineers
were
seeking
a
route
by
the
south
side
of
lake
chalco
to
flank
the
city
and
come
upon
it
from

was
found
around

side
of

mountain
near
its

where
volcanic

three
miles
from
augustin
tlalpam
on
the
road
to
churubusco
and
the
city
of
mexico
the
ground
on
which
san
antonio
stands
is
completely
in
the
valley
and
the
surface
of
the
land
is
only
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
lakes
and
except
to
the
it
was
cut
up
by
deep
ditches
filled
with
water
to
the
is
the
pedregal
the
volcanic
rock
before
spoken
of
over
which
cavalry
or
artillery
could
not
be
passed
and
infantry
would
make
but
poor
progress
if
confronted
by
an
enemy
from
the
position
occupied
by
garland
brigade
therefore
no
movement
could
be
made
against
the
defences
of
san
antonio
except
to
the
front
and
by
a
narrow
causeway
over
perfectly
level
ground
every
inch
of
which
was
commanded
by
the
enemy
artillery
and
infantry
if
contreras
some
three
miles
west
and
south
should
fall
into
our
hands
troops
from
there
could
move
to
the
right
flank
of
all
the
positions
held
by
the
enemy
between
us
and
the
city
under
these
circumstances
general
scott
directed
the
holding
of
the
front
of
the
enemy
without
making
an
attack
until
further
orders
on
the
of
august
the
day
of
reaching
san
augustin
tlalpam
garland
brigade
secured
a
position
within
easy
range
of
the
advanced
intrenchments
of
san
antonio
but
where
his
troops
were
protected
by
an
artificial
embankment
that
had
been
thrown
up
for
some
other
purpose
than
defense
general
scott
at
once
set
his
engineers
reconnoitring
the
works
about
contreras
and
on
the
movements
were
commenced
to
get
troops
into
positions
from
which
an
assault
could
be
made
upon
the
force
occupying
that
place
the
pedregal
on
the
north
and
and
the
mountain
on
the
south
made
the
passage
by
either
flank
of
the
defences
difficult
for
their
work
stood
exactly
between
those
natural
bulwarks
but
a
road
was
completed
during
the
day
and
night
of
the
and
troops
were
got
to
the
north
and
west
of
the
enemy
this
affair
like
that
of
cerro
gordo
was
an
engagement
in
which
the
officers
of
the
engineer
corps
won
special
distinction
in
fact
in
both
cases
tasks
which
seemed
difficult
at
first
sight
were
made
easier
for
the
troops
that
had
to
execute
them
than
they
would
have
been
on
an
ordinary
field
the
very
strength
of
each
of
these
positions
was
by
the
skill
of
the
engineers
converted
into
a
defence
for
the
assaulting
parties
while
securing
their
positions
for
final
attack
all
the
troops
with
general
scott
in
the
valley
of
mexico
except
a
part
of
the
division
of
general
quitman
at
san
augustin
tlalpam
and
the
brigade
of
garland
worth
division
at
san
antonio
were
engaged
at
the
battle
of
contreras
or
were
on
their
way
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
their
chief
to
reinforce
those
who
were
engaged
the
assault
was
made
on
the
morning
of
the
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
from
the
sound
of
the
advance
the
position
was
in
our
hands
with
many
prisoners
and
large
quantities
of
ordnance
and
other
stores
the
brigade
commanded
by
general
riley
was
from
its
position
the
most
conspicuous
in
the
final
assault
but
all
did
well
volunteers
and
regulars
from
the
point
occupied
by
garland
brigade
we
could
see
the
progress
made
at
contreras
and
the
movement
of
troops
toward
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
enemy
opposing
us
the
mexicans
all
the
way
back
to
the
city
could
see
the
same
thing
and
their
conduct
showed
plainly
that
they
did
not
enjoy
the
sight
we
moved
out
at
once
and
found
them
gone
from
our
immediate
front
clarke
brigade
of
worth
division
now
moved
west
over
the
point
of
the
pedregal
and
after
having
passed
to
the
north
sufficiently
to
clear
san
antonio
turned
east
and
got
on
the
causeway
leading
to
churubusco
and
the
city
of
mexico
when
he
approached
churubusco
his
left
under
colonel
hoffman
attacked
a
at
that
place
and
brought
on
an
engagement
about
an
hour
after
garland
was
ordered
to
advance
directly
along
the
causeway
and
got
up
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
engagement
san
antonio
was
found
evacuated
the
evacuation
having
probably
taken
place
immediately
upon
the
enemy
seeing
the
stars
and
stripes
waving
over
contreras
the
troops
that
had
been
engaged
at
contreras
and
even
then
on
their
way
to
that
were
moved
by
a
causeway
west
of
and
parallel
to
the
one
by
way
of
san
antonio
and
churubusco
it
was
expected
by
the
commanding
general
that
these
troops
would
move
north
sufficiently
far
to
flank
the
enemy
out
of
his
position
at
churubusco
before
turning
east
to
reach
the
san
antonio
road
but
they
did
not
succeed
in
this
and
churubusco
proved
to
be
about
the
severest
battle
fought
in
the
valley
of
mexico
general
scott
coming
upon
the
about
this
juncture
ordered
two
brigades
under
shields
to
move
north
and
turn
the
right
of
the
enemy
this
shields
did
but
not
without
hard
fighting
and
heavy
loss
the
enemy
finally
gave
way
leaving
in
our
hands
prisoners
artillery
and
small
arms
the
balance
of
the
causeway
held
by
the
enemy
up
to
the
very
gates
of
the
city
fell
in
like
manner
i
recollect
at
this
place
that
some
of
the
gunners
who
had
stood
their
ground
were
deserters
from
general
taylor
army
on
the
rio
grande
both
the
strategy
and
tactics
displayed
by
general
scott
in
these
various
engagements
of
the
of
august
were
faultless
as
i
look
upon
them
now
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
as
before
stated
the
work
of
the
engineer
officers
who
made
the
reconnoissances
and
led
the
different
commands
to
their
destinations
was
so
perfect
that
the
chief
was
able
to
give
his
orders
to
his
various
subordinates
with
all
the
precision
he
could
use
on
an
ordinary
march
i
mean
up
to
the
points
from
which
the
attack
was
to
commence
after
that
point
is
reached
the
enemy
often
induces
a
change
of
orders
not
before
contemplated
the
enemy
outside
the
city
outnumbered
our
soldiery
quite
three
to
one
but
they
had
become
so
demoralized
by
the
succession
of
defeats
this
day
that
the
city
of
mexico
could
have
been
entered
without
much
further
bloodshed
in
fact
captain
philip
kearney
afterwards
a
general
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
rode
with
a
squadron
of
cavalry
to
the
very
gates
of
the
city
and
would
no
doubt
have
entered
with
his
little
force
only
at
that
point
he
was
badly
wounded
as
were
several
of
his
officers
he
had
not
heard
the
call
for
a
halt
general
franklin
pierce
had
joined
the
army
in
mexico
at
puebla
a
short
time
before
the
advance
upon
the
capital
commenced
he
had
consequently
not
been
in
any
of
the
engagements
of
the
war
up
to
the
battle
of
contreras
by
an
unfortunate
fall
of
his
horse
on
the
afternoon
of
the
he
was
painfully
injured
the
next
day
when
his
brigade
with
the
other
troops
engaged
on
the
same
field
was
ordered
against
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
enemy
guarding
the
different
points
of
the
road
from
san
augustin
tlalpam
to
the
city
general
pierce
attempted
to
accompany
them
he
was
not
sufficiently
recovered
to
do
so
and
fainted
this
circumstance
gave
rise
to
exceedingly
unfair
and
unjust
criticisms
of
him
when
he
became
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
whatever
general
pierce
qualifications
may
have
been
for
the
presidency
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
courage
i
was
not
a
supporter
of
him
politically
but
i
knew
him
more
intimately
than
i
did
any
other
of
the
volunteer
generals
general
scott
abstained
from
entering
the
city
at
this
time
because
nicholas
trist
the
commissioner
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
was
with
the
army
and
either
he
or
general
scott
thought
probably
both
of
them
that
a
treaty
would
be
more
possible
while
the
mexican
government
was
in
possession
of
the
capital
than
if
it
was
scattered
and
the
capital
in
the
hands
of
an
invader
be
this
as
it
may
we
did
not
enter
at
that
time
the
army
took
up
positions
along
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
south
of
the
city
as
far
west
as
tacubaya
negotiations
were
at
once
entered
into
with
santa
anna
who
was
then
practically
the
government
and
the
immediate
commander
of
all
the
troops
engaged
in
defence
of
the
country
a
truce
was
signed
which
denied
to
either
party
the
right
to
strengthen
its
position
or
to
receive
reinforcements
during
the
continuance
of
the
armistices
but
authorized
general
scott
to
draw
supplies
for
his
army
from
the
city
in
the
meantime
negotiations
were
commenced
at
once
and
were
kept
up
vigorously
between
trist
and
the
commissioners
appointed
on
the
part
of
mexico
until
the
of
september
at
that
time
trist
handed
in
his
ultimatum
texas
was
to
be
given
up
absolutely
by
mexico
and
new
mexico
and
california
ceded
to
the
united
states
for
a
stipulated
sum
to
be
afterwards
determined
i
do
not
suppose
trist
had
any
discretion
whatever
in
regard
to
boundaries
the
war
was
one
of
conquest
in
the
interest
of
an
institution
and
the
probabilities
are
that
private
instructions
were
for
the
acquisition
of
territory
out
of
which
new
states
might
be
carved
at
all
events
the
mexicans
felt
so
outraged
at
the
terms
proposed
that
they
commenced
preparations
for
defence
without
giving
notice
of
the
termination
of
the
armistice
the
terms
of
the
truce
had
been
violated
before
when
teams
had
been
sent
into
the
city
to
bring
out
supplies
for
the
army
the
first
train
entering
the
city
was
very
severely
threatened
by
a
mob
this
however
was
apologized
for
by
the
authorities
and
all
responsibility
for
it
denied
and
thereafter
to
avoid
exciting
the
mexican
people
and
soldiery
our
teams
with
their
escorts
were
sent
in
at
night
when
the
troops
were
in
barracks
and
the
citizens
in
bed
the
circumstance
was
overlooked
and
negotiations
continued
as
soon
as
the
news
reached
general
scott
of
the
second
violation
of
the
armistice
about
the
of
september
he
wrote
a
vigorous
note
to
president
santa
anna
calling
his
attention
to
it
and
receiving
an
unsatisfactory
reply
declared
the
armistice
at
an
end
general
scott
with
worth
division
was
now
occupying
tacubaya
a
village
some
four
miles
of
the
city
of
mexico
and
extending
from
the
base
up
the
for
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
more
than
a
mile
west
and
also
a
little
above
the
plain
stands
molino
del
rey
the
mill
is
a
long
stone
structure
one
story
high
and
several
hundred
feet
in
length
at
the
period
of
which
i
speak
general
scott
supposed
a
portion
of
the
mill
to
be
used
as
a
foundry
for
the
casting
of
guns
this
however
proved
to
be
a
mistake
it
was
valuable
to
the
mexicans
because
of
the
quantity
of
grain
it
contained
the
building
is
flat
roofed
and
a
line
of
over
the
outer
walls
rendered
the
top
quite
a
formidable
defence
for
infantry
chapultepec
is
a
mound
springing
up
from
the
plain
to
the
height
of
probably
three
hundred
feet
and
almost
in
a
direct
line
between
molino
del
rey
and
the
western
part
of
the
city
it
was
fortified
both
on
the
top
and
on
the
rocky
and
precipitous
sides
the
city
of
mexico
is
supplied
with
water
by
two
aqueducts
resting
on
strong
stone
arches
one
of
these
aqueducts
draws
its
supply
of
water
from
a
mountain
stream
coming
into
it
at
or
near
molino
del
rey
and
runs
north
close
to
the
west
base
of
chapultepec
thence
along
the
centre
of
a
wide
road
until
it
reaches
the
road
running
east
into
the
city
by
the
garita
san
cosme
from
which
point
the
aqueduct
and
road
both
run
east
to
the
city
the
second
aqueduct
starts
from
the
east
base
of
chapultepec
where
it
is
fed
by
a
spring
and
runs
to
the
city
this
aqueduct
like
the
other
runs
in
the
middle
of
a
broad
thus
leaving
a
space
on
each
side
the
arches
supporting
the
aqueduct
afforded
protection
for
advancing
troops
as
well
as
to
those
engaged
defensively
at
points
on
the
san
cosme
road
parapets
were
thrown
across
with
an
embrasure
for
a
single
piece
of
artillery
in
each
at
the
point
where
both
road
and
aqueduct
turn
at
right
angles
from
north
to
east
there
was
not
only
one
of
these
parapets
supplied
by
one
gun
and
infantry
supports
but
the
houses
to
the
north
of
the
san

road
facing
south
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
road
back
to

covered
with
infantry
protected
by
parapets
made
of
sandbags
the
roads
leading
to

the

san

and
belen
by
which
these
aqueducts
enter
the
city
were
strongly
intrenched
deep
wide
ditches
filled
with
water
lined
the
sides
of
both
roads
such
were
the
defences
of
the
city
of
mexico
in
september
on
the
routes
over
which
general
scott
entered
prior
to
the
mexican
war
general
scott
had
been
very
partial
to
general
worth
indeed
he
continued
so
up
to
the
close
of
hostilities
but
for
some
reason
worth
had
become
estranged
from
his
chief
scott
evidently
took
this
coldness
somewhat
to
heart
he
did
not
retaliate
however
but
on
the
contrary
showed
every
disposition
to
appease
his
subordinate
it
was
understood
at
the
time
that
he
gave
worth
authority
to
plan
and
execute
the
battle
of
molino
del
rey
without
dictation
or
interference
from
any
one
for
the
very
purpose
of
restoring
their
former
relations
the
effort
failed
and
the
two
generals
remained
ever
after
cold
and
indifferent
towards
each
other
if
not
actually
hostile
the
battle
of
molino
del
rey
was
fought
on
the
of
september
the
night
of
the
worth
sent
for
his
brigade
and
regimental
commanders
with
their
staffs
to
come
to
his
quarters
to
receive
instructions
for
the
morrow
these
orders
contemplated
a
movement
up
to
within
striking
distance
of
the
mills
before
daylight
the
engineers
had
reconnoitred
the
ground
as
well
as
possible
and
had
acquired
all
the
information
necessary
to
base
proper
orders
both
for
approach
and
attack
by
daylight
on
the
morning
of
the
the
troops
to
be
engaged
at
molino
were
all
at
the
places
designated
the
ground
in
front
of
the
mills
to
the
south
was
commanded
by
the
artillery
from
the
summit
of
chapultepec
as
well
as
by
the
lighter
batteries
at
hand
but
a
charge
was
made
and
soon
all
was
over
worth
troops
entered
the
mills
by
every
door
and
the
enemy
beat
a
hasty
retreat
back
to
chapultepec
had
this
victory
been
followed
up
promptly
no
doubt
americans
and
mexicans
would
have
gone
over
the
defences
of
chapultepec
so
near
together
that
the
place
would
have
fallen
into
our
hands
without
further
loss
the
defenders
of
the
works
could
not
have
fired
upon
us
without
endangering
their
own
men
this
was
not
done
and
five
days
later
more
valuable
lives
were
sacrificed
to
carry
works
which
had
been
so
nearly
in
our
possession
on
the
i
do
not
criticise
the
failure
to
capture
chapultepec
at
this
time
the
result
that
followed
the
first
assault
could
not
possibly
have
been
foreseen
and
to
profit
by
the
unexpected
advantage
the
commanding
general
must
have
been
on
the
spot
and
given
the
necessary
instructions
at
the
moment
or
the
troops
must
have
kept
on
without
orders
it
is
always
however
in
order
to
follow
a
retreating
foe
unless
stopped
or
otherwise
directed
the
loss
on
our
side
at
molino
del
rey
was
severe
for
the
numbers
engaged
it
was
especially
so
among
commissioned
officers
i
was
with
the
earliest
of
the
troops
to
enter
the
mills
in
passing
through
to
the
north
side
looking
towards
chapultepec
i
happened
to
notice
that
there
were
armed
mexicans
still
on
top
of
the
building
only
a
few
feet
from
many
of
our
men
not
seeing
any
stairway
or
ladder
reaching
to
the
top
of
the
building
i
took
a
few
soldiers
and
had
a
cart
that
happened
to
be
standing
near
brought
up
and
placing
the
shafts
against
the
wall
and
chocking
the
wheels
so
that
the
cart
could
not
back
used
the
shafts
as
a
sort
of
ladder
extending
to
within
three
or
four
feet
of
the
top
by
this
i
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
building
followed
by
a
few
men
but
found
a
private
soldier
had
preceded
me
by
some
other
way
there
were
still
quite
a
number
of
mexicans
on
the
roof
among
them
a
major
and
five
or
six
officers
of
lower
grades
who
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
away
before
our
troops
occupied
the
building
they
still
had
their
arms
while
the
soldier
before
mentioned
was
walking
as
sentry
guarding
the
prisoners
he
had
surrounded
all
by
himself
i
halted
the
sentinel
received
the
swords
from
the
commissioned
officers
and
proceeded
with
the
assistance
of
the
soldiers
now
with
me
to
disable
the
muskets
by
striking
them
against
the
edge
of
the
wall
and
throw
them
to
the
ground
below
molino
del
rey
was
now
captured
and
the
troops
engaged
with
the
exception
of
an
appropriate
guard
over
the
captured
position
and
property
were
marched
back
to
their
quarters
in
tacubaya
the
engagement
did
not
last
many
minutes
but
the
killed
and
wounded
were
numerous
for
the
number
of
troops
engaged
during
the
night
of
the
batteries
were
established
which
could
play
upon
the
fortifications
of
chapultepec
the
bombardment
commenced
early
on
the
morning
of
the
but
there
was
no
further
engagement
during
this
day
than
that
of
the
artillery
general
scott
assigned
the
capture
of
chapultepec
to
general
pillow
but
did
not
leave
the
details
to
his
judgment
two
assaulting
columns
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
each
composed
of
volunteers
for
the
occasion
were
formed
they
were
commanded
by
captains
mckinzie
and
casey
respectively
the
assault
was
successful
but
bloody
in
later
years
if
not
at
the
time
the
battles
of
molino
del
rey
and
chapultepec
have
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
wholly
unnecessary
when
the
assaults
upon
the
garitas
of
san
cosme
and
belen
were
determined
upon
the
road
running
east
to
the
former
gate
could
have
been
reached
easily
without
an
engagement
by
moving
along
south
of
the
mills
until
west
of
them
sufficiently
far
to
be
out
of
range
thence
north
to
the
road
above
mentioned
or
if
desirable
to
keep
the
two
attacking
columns
nearer
together
the
troops
could
have
been
turned
east
so
as
to
come
on
the
aqueduct
road
out
of
range
of
the
guns
from
chapultepec
in
like
manner
the
troops
designated
to
act
against
belen
could
have
kept
east
of
chapultepec
out
of
range
and
come
on
to
the
aqueduct
also
out
of
range
of
chapultepec
molino
del
rey
and
chapultepec
would
both
have
been
necessarily
evacuated
if
this
course
had
been
pursued
for
they
would
have
been
turned
general
quitman
a
volunteer
from
the
state
of
mississippi
who
stood
well
with
the
army
both
as
a
soldier
and
as
a
man
commanded
the
column
acting
against
belen
general
worth
commanded
the
column
against
san
cosme
when
chapultepec
fell
the
advance
commenced
along
the
two
aqueduct
roads
i
was
on
the
road
to
san
cosme
and
witnessed
most
that
took
place
on
that
route
when
opposition
was
encountered
our
troops
sheltered
themselves
by
keeping
under
the
arches
supporting
the
aqueduct
advancing
an
arch
at
a
time
we
encountered
no
serious
obstruction
until
within
of
the
point
where
the
road
we
were
on
intersects
that
running
east
to
the
city
the
point
where
the
aqueduct
turns
at
a
right
angle
i
have
described
the
defences
of
this
position
before
there
were
but
three
commissioned
officers
besides
myself
that
i
can
now
call
to
mind
with
the
advance
when
the
above
position
was
reached
one
of
these
officers
was
a
lieutenant
semmes
of
the
marine
corps
i
think
captain
gore
and
lieutenant
judah
of
the
infantry
were
the
others
our
progress
was
stopped
for
the
time
by
the
single
piece
of
artillery
at
the
angle
of
the
roads
and
the
infantry
occupying
the
back
from
it
west
of
the
road
from
where
we
were
stood
a
house
occupying
the
angle
made
by
the
san
cosme
road
and
the
road
we
were
moving
upon
a
stone
wall
ran
from
the
house
along
each
of
these
roads
for
a
considerable
distance
and
thence
back
until
it
joined
enclosing
quite
a
yard
about
the
house
i
watched
my
opportunity
and
skipped
across
the
road
and
behind
the
south
wall
proceeding
cautiously
to
the
west
corner
of
the
enclosure
i
peeped
around
and
seeing
nobody
continued
still
cautiously
until
the
road
running
east
and
west
was
reached
i
then
returned
to
the
troops
and
called
for
volunteers
all
that
were
close
to
me
or
that
heard
me
about
a
dozen
offered
their
services
commanding
them
to
carry
their
arms
at
a
trail
i
watched
our
opportunity
and
got
them
across
the
road
and
under
cover
of
the
wall
beyond
before
the
enemy
had
a
shot
at
us
our
men
under
cover
of
the
arches
kept
a
close
watch
on
the
intrenchments
that
crossed
our
path
and
the
beyond
and
whenever
a
head
showed
itself
above
the
parapets
they
would
fire
at
it
our
crossing
was
thus
made
practicable
without
loss
when
we
reached
a
safe
position
i
instructed
my
little
command
again
to
carry
their
arms
at
a
trail
not
to
fire
at
the
enemy
until
they
were
ordered
and
to
move
very
cautiously
following
me
until
the
san
cosme
road
was
reached
we
would
then
be
on
the
flank
of
the
men
serving
the
gun
on
the
road
and
with
no
obstruction
between
us
and
them
when
we
reached
the
corner
of
the
enclosure
before
described
i
saw
some
united
states
troops
pushing
north
through
a
shallow
ditch
near
by
who
had
come
up
since
my
reconnaissance
this
was
the
company
of
captain
horace
brooks
of
the
artillery
acting
as
infantry
i
explained
to
brooks
briefly
what
i
had
discovered
and
what
i
was
about
to
do
he
said
as
i
knew
the
ground
and
he
did
not
i
might
go
on
and
he
would
follow
as
soon
as
we
got
on
the
road
leading
to
the
city
the
troops
serving
the
gun
on
the
parapet
retreated
and
those
on
the
near
by
followed
our
men
went
after
them
in
such
close
pursuit
the
troops
we
had
left
under
the
arches
joining
that
a
second
line
across
the
road
about
between
the
first
and
the
garita
was
carried
no
reinforcements
had
yet
come
up
except
brooks
company
and
the
position
we
had
taken
was
too
advanced
to
be
held
by
so
small
a
force
it
was
given
up
but
retaken
later
in
the
day
with
some
loss
worth
command
gradually
advanced
to
the
front
now
open
to
it
later
in
the
day
in
reconnoitring
i
found
a
church
off
to
the
south
of
the
road
which
looked
to
me
as
if
the
belfry
would
command
the
ground
back
of
the
garita
san
cosme
i
got
an
officer
of
the
voltigeurs
with
a
mountain
howitzer
and
men
to
work
it
to
go
with
me
the
road
being
in
possession
of
the
enemy
we
had
to
take
the
field
to
the
south
to
reach
the
church
this
took
us
over
several
ditches
breast
deep
in
water
and
grown
up
with
water
plants
these
ditches
however
were
not
over
eight
or
ten
feet
in
width
the
howitzer
was
taken
to
pieces
and
carried
by
the
men
to
its
destination
when
i
knocked
for
admission
a
priest
came
to
the
door
who
while
extremely
polite
declined
to
admit
us
with
the
little
spanish
then
at
my
command
i
explained
to
him
that
he
might
save
property
by
opening
the
door
and
he
certainly
would
save
himself
from
becoming
a
prisoner
for
a
time
at
least
and
besides
i
intended
to
go
in
whether
he
consented
or
not
he
began
to
see
his
duty
in
the
same
light
that
i
did
and
opened
the
door
though
he
did
not
look
as
if
it
gave
him
special
pleasure
to
do
so
the
gun
was
carried
to
the
belfry
and
put
together
we
were
not
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
yards
from
san
cosme
the
shots
from
our
little
gun
dropped
in
upon
the
enemy
and
created
great
confusion
why
they
did
not
send
out
a
small
party
and
capture
us
i
do
not
know
we
had
no
infantry
or
other
defences
besides
our
one
gun
the
effect
of
this
gun
upon
the
troops
about
the
gate
of
the
city
was
so
marked
that
general
worth
saw
it
from
his
position
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
sent
a
staff
officer
lieutenant
pemberton
later
commanding
the
defences
of
vicksburg
to
bring
me
to
him
he
expressed
his
gratification
at
the
services
the
howitzer
in
the
church
steeple
was
doing
saying
that
every
shot
was
effective
and
ordered
a
captain
of
voltigeurs
to
report
to
me
with
another
howitzer
to
be
placed
along
with
the
one
already
rendering
so
much
service
i
could
not
tell
the
general
that
there
was
not
room
enough
in
the
steeple
for
another
gun
because
he
probably
would
have
looked
upon
such
a
statement
as
a
contradiction
from
a
second
lieutenant
i
took
the
captain
with
me
but
did
not
use
his
gun
the
night
of
the
of
september
was
spent
by
the
troops
under
general
worth
in
the
houses
near
san
cosme
and
in
line
confronting
the
general
line
of
the
enemy
across
to
belen
the
troops
that
i
was
with
were
in
the
houses
north
of
the
road
leading
into
the
city
and
were
engaged
during
the
night
in
cutting
from
one
house
to
another
towards
the
town
during
the
night
santa
anna
with
his
army
except
the
deserters
left
the
city
he
liberated
all
the
convicts
confined
in
the
town
hoping
no
doubt
that
they
would
inflict
upon
us
some
injury
before
daylight
but
several
hours
after
santa
anna
was
out
of
the
way
the
city
authorities
sent
a
delegation
to
general
scott
to
ask
if
not
demand
an
armistice
respecting
church
property
the
rights
of
citizens
and
the
supremacy
of
the
city
government
in
the
management
of
municipal
affairs
general
scott
declined
to
trammel
himself
with
conditions
but
gave
assurances
that
those
who
chose
to
remain
within
our
lines
would
be
protected
so
long
as
they
behaved
themselves
properly
general
quitman
had
advanced
along
his
line
very
successfully
on
the
so
that
at
night
his
command
occupied
nearly
the
same
position
at
belen
that
worth
troops
did
about
san
cosme
after
the
interview
above
related
between
general
scott
and
the
city
council
orders
were
issued
for
the
cautious
entry
of
both
columns
in
the
morning
the
troops
under
worth
were
to
stop
at
the
alameda
a
park
near
the
west
end
of
the
city
quitman
was
to
go
directly
to
the
plaza
and
take
possession
of
the
palace
a
mass
of
buildings
on
the
east
side
in
which
congress
has
its
sessions
the
national
courts
are
held
the
public
offices
are
all
located
the
president
resides
and
much
room
is
left
for
museums
receptions
etc
this
is
the
building
generally
designated
as
the

the

mexican
soldiers
peace
negotiations
on
entering
the
city
the
troops
were
fired
upon
by
the
released
convicts
and
possibly
by
deserters
and
hostile
citizens
the
streets
were
deserted
and
the
place
presented
the
appearance
of
a
city
of
the
dead
except
for
this
firing
by
unseen
persons
from
windows
and
around
corners
in
this
firing
the
of
my
regiment
garland
was
badly
wounded
lieutenant
sidney
smith
of
the
infantry
was
also
wounded
mortally
he
died
a
few
days
after
and
by
his
death
i
was
promoted
to
the
grade
of
first
lieutenant
i
had
gone
into
the
battle
of
palo
alto
in
may
a
second
lieutenant
and
i
entered
the
city
of
mexico
sixteen
months
later
with
the
same
rank
after
having
been
in
all
the
engagements
possible
for
any
one
man
and
in
a
regiment
that
lost
more
officers
during
the
war
than
it
ever
had
present
at
any
one
engagement
my
regiment
lost
four
commissioned
officers
all
senior
to
me
by
steamboat
explosions
during
the
mexican
war
the
mexicans
were
not
so
discriminating
they
sometimes
picked
off
my
juniors
general
scott
soon
followed
the
troops
into
the
city
in
state
i
wonder
that
he
was
not
fired
upon
but
i
believe
he
was
not
at
all
events
he
was
not
hurt
he
took
quarters
at
first
in
the
halls
of
the
montezumas
and
from
there
issued
his
wise
and
discreet
orders
for
the
government
of
a
conquered
city
and
for
suppressing
the
hostile
acts
of
liberated
convicts
already
spoken
of
orders
which
challenge
the
respect
of
all
who
study
them
lawlessness
was
soon
suppressed
and
the
city
of
mexico
settled
down
into
a
quiet
place
the
people
began
to
make
their
appearance
upon
the
streets
without
fear
of
the
invaders
shortly
afterwards
the
bulk
of
the
troops
were
sent
from
the
city
to
the
villages
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
four
or
five
miles
to
the
south
and
whether
general
scott
approved
of
the
mexican
war
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
brought
about
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
his
orders
to
troops
indicate
only
a
soldierly
spirit
with
probably
a
little
regard
for
the
perpetuation
of
his
own
fame
on
the
other
hand
general
taylor
i
think
indicate
that
he
considered
the
administration
accountable
for
the
war
and
felt
no
responsibility
resting
on
himself
further
than
for
the
faithful
performance
of
his
duties
both
generals
deserve
the
commendations
of
their
countrymen
and
to
live
in
the
grateful
memory
of
this
people
to
the
latest
generation
earlier
in
this
narrative
i
have
stated
that
the
plain
reached
after
passing
the
mountains
east
of
perote
extends
to
the
cities
of
puebla
and
mexico
the
route
travelled
by
the
army
before
reaching
puebla
goes
over
a
pass
in
a
spur
of
mountain
coming
up
from
the
south
this
pass
is
very
susceptible
of
defence
by
a
smaller
against
a
larger
force
again
the
highest
point
of
the
between
vera
cruz
and
the
city
of
mexico
is
over
rio
frio
mountain
which
also
might
have
been
successfully
defended
by
an
inferior
against
a
superior
force
but
by
moving
north
of
the
mountains
and
about
thirty
miles
north
of
puebla
both
of
these
passes
would
have
been
avoided
the
road
from
perote
to
the
city
of
mexico
by
this
latter
route
is
as
level
as
the
prairies
in
our
west
arriving
due
north
from
puebla
troops
could
have
been
detached
to
take
possession
of
that
place
and
then
proceeding
west
with
the
rest
of
the
army
no
mountain
would
have
been
encountered
before
reaching
the
city
of
mexico
it
is
true
this
road
would
have
brought
troops
in
by
guadalupe
a
town
church
and
detached
spur
of
mountain
about
two
miles
north
of
the
capital
all
bearing
the
same
general
name
and
at
this
point
lake
texcoco
comes
near
to
the
mountain
which
was
fortified
both
at
the
base
and
on
the
sides
but
troops
could
have
passed
north
of
the
mountain
and
come
in
only
a
few
miles
to
the
and
so
flanked
the
position
as
they
actually
did
on
the
south
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
this
northern
route
to
the
city
of
mexico
would
have
been
the
better
one
to
have
taken
but
my
later
experience
has
taught
me
two
lessons
first
that
things
are
seen
plainer
after
the
events
have
occurred
second
that
the
most
confident
critics
are
generally
those
who
know
the
least
about
the
matter
criticised
i
know
just
enough
about
the
mexican
war
to
approve
heartily
of
most
of
the
generalship
but
to
differ
with
a
little
of
it
it
is
natural
that
an
important
city
like
puebla
should
not
have
been
passed
with
contempt
it
may
be
natural
that
the
direct
road
to
it
should
have
been
taken
but
it
could
have
been
passed
its
evacuation
insured
and
possession
acquired
without
danger
of
encountering
the
enemy
in
intricate
mountain
defiles
in
this
same
way
the
city
of
mexico
could
have
been
approached
without
any
danger
of
opposition
except
in
the
open
field
but
general
scott
successes
are
an
answer
to
all
criticism
he
invaded
a
populous
country
penetrating
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
into
the
interior
with
a
force
at
no
time
equal
to
of
that
opposed
to
him
he
was
without
a
base
the
enemy
was
always
intrenched
always
on
the
defensive
yet
he
won
every
battle
he
captured
the
capital
and
conquered
the
government
credit
is
due
to
the
troops
engaged
it
is
true
but
the
plans
and
the
strategy
were
the
general
i
had
now
made
marches
and
been
in
battle
under
both
general
scott
and
general
taylor
the
former
divided
his
force
of
men
into
four
columns
starting
a
day
apart
in
moving
from
puebla
to
the
capital
of
the
nation
when
it
was
known
that
an
army
more
than
twice
as
large
as
his
own
stood
ready
to
resist
his
coming
the
road
was
broad
and
the
country
open
except
in
crossing
the
rio
frio
mountain
general
taylor
pursued
the
same
course
in
marching
toward
an
enemy
he
moved
even
in
smaller
bodies
i
never
thought
at
the
time
to
doubt
the
infallibility
of
these
two
generals
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
their
profession
i
supposed
they
moved
in
small
bodies
because
more
men
could
not
be
passed
over
a
single
road
on
the
same
day
with
their
artillery
and
necessary
trains
later
i
found
the
fallacy
of
this
belief
the
rebellion
which
followed
as
a
sequence
to
the
mexican
war
never
could
have
been
suppressed
if
larger
bodies
of
men
could
not
have
been
moved
at
the
same
time
than
was
the
custom
under
scott
and
taylor
the
victories
in
mexico
were
in
every
instance
over
vastly
superior
numbers
there
were
two
reasons
for
this
both
general
scott
and
general
taylor
had
such
armies
as
are
not
often
got
together
at
the
battles
of
palo
alto
and
general
taylor
had
a
small
army
but
it
was
composed
exclusively
of
regular
troops
under
the
best
of
drill
and
discipline
every
officer
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
was
educated
in
his
profession
not
at
west
point
necessarily
but
in
the
camp
in
garrison
and
many
of
them
in
indian
wars
the
rank
and
file
were
probably
inferior
as
material
out
of
which
to
make
an
army
to
the
volunteers
that
participated
in
all
the
later
battles
of
the
war
but
they
were
brave
men
and
then
drill
and
discipline
brought
out
all
there
was
in
them
a
better
army
man
for
man
probably
never
faced
an
enemy
than
the
one
commanded
by
general
taylor
in
the
earliest
two
engagements
of
the
mexican
war
the
volunteers
who
followed
were
of
better
material
but
without
drill
or
discipline
at
the
start
they
were
associated
with
so
many
disciplined
men
and
professionally
educated
officers
that
when
they
went
into
engagements
it
was
with
a
confidence
they
would
not
have
felt
otherwise
they
became
soldiers
themselves
almost
at
once
all
these
conditions
we
would
enjoy
again
in
case
of
war
the
mexican
army
of
that
day
was
hardly
an
organization
the
private
soldier
was
picked
up
from
the
lower
class
of
the
inhabitants
when
wanted
his
consent
was
not
asked
he
was
poorly
clothed
worse
fed
and
seldom
paid
he
was
turned
adrift
when
no
longer
wanted
the
officers
of
the
lower
grades
were
but
little
superior
to
the
men
with
all
this
i
have
seen
as
brave
stands
made
by
some
of
these
men
as
i
have
ever
seen
made
by
soldiers
now
mexico
has
a
standing
army
larger
than
that
of
the
united
states
they
have
a
military
school
modelled
after
west
point
their
officers
are
educated
and
no
doubt
generally
brave
the
mexican
war
of
would
be
an
impossibility
in
this
generation
the
mexicans
have
shown
a
patriotism
which
it
would
be
well
if
we
would
imitate
in
part
but
with
more
regard
to
truth
they
celebrate
the
anniversaries
of
chapultepec
and
molino
del
rey
as
of
very
great
victories
the
anniversaries
are
recognized
as
national
holidays
at
these
two
battles
while
the
united
states
troops
were
victorious
it
was
at
very
great
sacrifice
of
life
compared
with
what
the
mexicans
suffered
the
mexicans
as
on
many
other
occasions
stood
up
as
well
as
any
troops
ever
did
the
trouble
seemed
to
be
the
lack
of
experience
among
the
officers
which
led
them
after
a
certain
time
to
simply
quit
without
being
particularly
whipped
but
because
they
had
fought
enough
their
authorities
of
the
present
day
grow
enthusiastic
over
their
theme
when
telling
of
these
victories
and
speak
with
pride
of
the
large
sum
of
money
they
forced
us
to
pay
in
the
end
with
us
now
twenty
years
after
the
close
of
the
most
stupendous
war
ever
known
we
have
writers
who
profess
devotion
to
the
nation
engaged
in
trying
to
prove
that
the
union
forces
were
not
victorious
practically
they
say
we
were
slashed
around
from
donelson
to
vicksburg
and
to
chattanooga
and
in
the
east
from
gettysburg
to
appomattox
when
the
physical
rebellion
gave
out
from
sheer
exhaustion
there
is
no
difference
in
the
amount
of
romance
in
the
two
stories
i
would
not
have
the
anniversaries
of
our
victories
celebrated
nor
those
of
our
defeats
made
fast
days
and
spent
in
humiliation
and
prayer
but
i
would
like
to
see
truthful
history
written
such
history
will
do
full
credit
to
the
courage
endurance
and
soldierly
ability
of
the
american
citizen
no
matter
what
section
of
the
country
he
hailed
from
or
in
what
ranks
he
fought
the
justice
of
the
cause
which
in
the
end
prevailed
will
i
doubt
not
come
to
be
acknowledged
by
every
citizen
of
the
land
in
time
for
the
present
and
so
long
as
there
are
living
witnesses
of
the
great
war
of
sections
there
will
be
people
who
will
not
be
consoled
for
the
loss
of
a
cause
which
they
believed
to
be
holy
as
time
passes
people
even
of
the
south
will
begin
to
wonder
how
it
was
possible
that
their
ancestors
ever
fought
for
or
justified
institutions
which
acknowledged
the
right
of
property
in
man
after
the
fall
of
the
capital
and
the
dispersal
of
the
government
of
mexico
it
looked
very
much
as
if
military
occupation
of
the
country
for
a
long
time
might
be
necessary
general
scott
at
once
began
the
preparation
of
orders
regulations
and
laws
in
view
of
this
contingency
he
contemplated
making
the
country
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
occupation
without
the
army
becoming
a
perceptible
burden
upon
the
people
his
plan
was
to
levy
a
direct
tax
upon
the
separate
states
and
collect
at
the
ports
left
open
to
trade
a
duty
on
all
imports
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
private
property
had
not
been
taken
either
for
the
use
of
the
army
or
of
individuals
without
full
compensation
this
policy
was
to
be
pursued
there
were
not
troops
enough
in
the
valley
of
mexico
to
occupy
many
points
but
now
that
there
was
no
organized
army
of
the
enemy
of
any
size
reinforcements
could
be
got
from
the
rio
grande
and
there
were
also
new
volunteers
arriving
from
time
to
time
all
by
way
of
vera
cruz
military
possession
was
taken
of
cuernavaca
fifty
miles
south
of
the
city
of
mexico
of
toluca
nearly
as
far
west
and
of
pachuca
a
mining
town
of
great
importance
some
sixty
miles
to
the
vera
cruz
jalapa
orizaba
and
puebla
were
already
in
our
possession
meanwhile
the
mexican
government
had
departed
in
the
person
of
santa
anna
and
it
looked
doubtful
for
a
time
whether
the
united
states
commissioner
trist
would
find
anybody
to
negotiate
with
a
temporary
government
however
was
soon
established
at
queretaro
and
trist
began
negotiations
for
a
conclusion
of
the
war
before
terms
were
finally
agreed
upon
he
was
ordered
back
to
washington
but
general
scott
prevailed
upon
him
to
remain
as
an
arrangement
had
been
so
nearly
reached
and
the
administration
must
approve
his
acts
if
he
succeeded
in
making
such
a
treaty
as
had
been
contemplated
in
his
instructions
the
treaty
was
finally
signed
the
of
february
and
accepted
by
the
government
at
washington
it
is
that
known
as
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
and
secured
to
the
united
states
the
rio
grande
as
the
boundary
of
texas
and
the
whole
territory
then
included
in
new
mexico
and
upper
california
for
the
sum
of
soon
after
entering
the
city
of
mexico
the
opposition
of
generals
pillow
worth
and
colonel
duncan
to
general
scott
became
very
marked
scott
claimed
that
they
had
demanded
of
the
president
his
removal
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
so
or
not
but
i
do
know
of
their
unconcealed
hostility
to
their
chief
at
last
he
placed
them
in
arrest
and
preferred
charges
against
them
of
insubordination
and
disrespect
this
act
brought
on
a
crisis
in
the
career
of
the
general
commanding
he
had
asserted
from
the
beginning
that
the
administration
was
hostile
to
him
that
it
had
failed
in
its
promises
of
men
and
war
material
that
the
president
himself
had
shown
duplicity
if
not
treachery
in
the
endeavor
to
procure
the
appointment
of
benton
and
the
administration
now
gave
open
evidence
of
its
enmity
about
the
middle
of
february
orders
came
convening
a
court
of
inquiry
composed
of
brevet
towson
the
of
the
army
cushing
and
colonel
belknap
to
inquire
into
the
conduct
of
the
accused
and
the
accuser
and
shortly
afterwards
orders
were
received
from
washington
relieving
scott
of
the
command
of
the
army
in
the
field
and
assigning
william
butler
of
kentucky
to
the
place
this
order
also
released
pillow
worth
and
duncan
from
arrest
if
a
change
was
to
be
made
the
selection
of
general
butler
was
agreeable
to
every
one
concerned
so
far
as
i
remember
to
have
heard
expressions
on
the
subject
there
were
many
who
regarded
the
treatment
of
general
scott
as
harsh
and
unjust
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
vanity
of
the
general
had
led
him
to
say
and
do
things
that
afforded
a
plausible
pretext
to
the
administration
for
doing
just
what
it
did
and
what
it
had
wanted
to
do
from
the
start
the
court
tried
the
accuser
quite
as
much
as
the
accused
it
was
adjourned
before
completing
its
labors
to
meet
in
frederick
maryland
general
scott
left
the
country
and
never
after
had
more
than
the
nominal
command
of
the
army
until
early
in
he
certainly
was
not
sustained
in
his
efforts
to
maintain
discipline
in
high
places
the
efforts
to
kill
off
politically
the
two
successful
generals
made
them
both
candidates
for
the
presidency
general
taylor
was
nominated
in
and
was
elected
four
years
later
general
scott
received
the
nomination
but
was
badly
beaten
and
the
party
nominating
him
died
with
his
defeat
chapter

regimental

trip

trip
to
the
caves
of
mexico
the
treaty
of
peace
between
the
two
countries
was
signed
by
the
commissioners
of
each
side
early
in
february
it
took
a
considerable
time
for
it
to
reach
washington
receive
the
approval
of
the
administration
and
be
finally
ratified
by
the
senate
it
was
naturally
supposed
by
the
army
that
there
would
be
no
more
fighting
and
officers
and
men
were
of
course
anxious
to
get
home
but
knowing
there
must
be
delay
they
contented
themselves
as
best
they
could
every
sunday
there
was
a
bull
fight
for
the
amusement
of
those
who
would
pay
their
fifty
cents
i
attended
one
of
them
just
one
not
wishing
to
leave
the
country
without
having
witnessed
the
national
sport
the
sight
to
me
was
sickening
i
could
not
see
how
human
beings
could
enjoy
the
sufferings
of
beasts
and
often
of
men
as
they
seemed
to
do
on
these
occasions
at
these
sports
there
are
usually
from
four
to
six
bulls
sacrificed
the
audience
occupies
seats
around
the
ring
in
which
the
exhibition
is
given
each
seat
but
the
foremost
rising
higher
than
the
one
in
front
so
that
every
one
can
get
a
full
view
of
the
sport
when
all
is
ready
a
bull
is
turned
into
the
ring
three
or
four
men
come
in
mounted
on
the
merest
skeletons
of
horses
blind
or
and
so
weak
that
they
could
not
make
a
sudden
turn
with
their
riders
without
danger
of
falling
down
the
men
are
armed
with
spears
having
a
point
as
sharp
as
a
needle
other
men
enter
the
arena
on
foot
armed
with
red
flags
and
explosives
about
the
size
of
a
musket
cartridge
to
each
of
these
explosives
is
fastened
a
barbed
needle
which
serves
the
purpose
of
attaching
them
to
the
bull
by
running
the
needle
into
the
skin
before
the
animal
is
turned
loose
a
lot
of
these
explosives
are
attached
to
him
the
pain
from
the
pricking
of
the
skin
by
the
needles
is
exasperating
but
when
the
explosions
of
the
cartridges
commence
the
animal
becomes
frantic
as
he
makes
a
lunge
towards
one
horseman
another
runs
a
spear
into
him
he
turns
towards
his
last
tormentor
when
a
man
on
foot
holds
out
a
red
flag
the
bull
rushes
for
this
and
is
allowed
to
take
it
on
his
horns
the
flag
drops
and
covers
the
eyes
of
the
animal
so
that
he
is
at
a
loss
what
to
do
it
is
jerked
from
him
and
the
torment
is
renewed
when
the
animal
is
worked
into
an
uncontrollable
frenzy
the
horsemen
withdraw
and
the
matadores
literally
murderers
enter
armed
with
knives
having
blades
twelve
or
eighteen
inches
long
and
sharp
the
trick
is
to
dodge
an
attack
from
the
animal
and
stab
him
to
the
heart
as
he
passes
if
these
efforts
fail
the
bull
is
finally
lassoed
held
fast
and
killed
by
driving
a
knife
blade
into
the
spinal
column
just
back
of
the
horns
he
is
then
dragged
out
by
horses
or
mules
another
is
let
into
the
ring
and
the
same
performance
is
renewed
on
the
occasion
when
i
was
present
one
of
the
bulls
was
not
turned
aside
by
the
attacks
in
the
rear
the
presentations
of
the
red
flag
but
kept
right
on
and
placing
his
horns
under
the
flanks
of
a
horse
threw
him
and
his
rider
to
the
ground
with
great
force
the
horse
was
killed
and
the
rider
lay
prostrate
as
if
dead
the
bull
was
then
lassoed
and
killed
in
the
manner
above
described
men
came
in
and
carried
the
dead
man
off
in
a
litter
when
the
slaughtered
bull
and
horse
were
dragged
out
a
fresh
bull
was
turned
into
the
ring
conspicuous
among
the
spectators
was
the
man
who
had
been
carried
out
on
a
litter
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
was
only
dead
so
far
as
that
performance
went
but
the
corpse
was
so
lively
that
it
could
not
forego
the
chance
of
witnessing
the
discomfiture
of
some
of
his
brethren
who
might
not
be
so
fortunate
there
was
a
feeling
of
disgust
manifested
by
the
audience
to
find
that
he
had
come
to
life
again
i
confess
that
i
felt
sorry
to
see
the
cruelty
to
the
bull
and
the
horse
i
did
not
stay
for
the
conclusion
of
the
performance
but
while
i
did
stay
there
was
not
a
bull
killed
in
the
prescribed
way
bull
fights
are
now
prohibited
in
the
federal
district
embracing
a
territory
around
the
city
of
mexico
somewhat
larger
than
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
are
not
an
institution
in
any
part
of
the
country
during
one
of
my
recent
visits
to
mexico
bull
fights
were
got
up
in
my
honor
at
puebla
and
at
pachuca
i
was
not
notified
in
advance
so
as
to
be
able
to
decline
and
thus
prevent
the
performance
but
in
both
cases
i
civilly
declined
to
attend
another
amusement
of
the
people
of
mexico
of
that
day
and
one
which
nearly
all
indulged
in
male
and
female
old
and
young
priest
and
layman
was
monte
playing
regular
feast
weeks
were
held
every
year
at
what
was
then
known
as
augustin
tlalpam
eleven
miles
out
of
town
there
were
dealers
to
suit
every
class
and
condition
of
people
in
many
of
the
booths
tlackos
the
copper
coin
of
the
country
four
of
them
making
six
and
a
quarter
cents
of
our
money
were
piled
up
in
great
quantities
with
some
silver
to
accommodate
the
people
who
could
not
bet
more
than
a
few
pennies
at
a
time
in
other
booths
silver
formed
the
bulk
of
the
capital
of
the
bank
with
a
few
doubloons
to
be
changed
if
there
should
be
a
run
of
luck
against
the
bank
in
some
there
was
no
coin
except
gold
here
the
rich
were
said
to
bet
away
their
entire
estates
in
a
single
day
all
this
is
stopped
now
for
myself
i
was
kept
somewhat
busy
during
the
winter
of
my
regiment
was
stationed
in
tacubaya
i
was
regimental
quartermaster
and
commissary
general
scott
had
been
unable
to
get
clothing
for
the
troops
from
the
north
the
men
were
becoming
well
they
needed
clothing
material
had
to
be
purchased
such
as
could
be
obtained
and
people
employed
to
make
it
up
into
yankee
uniforms
a
quartermaster
in
the
city
was
designated
to
attend
to
this
special
duty
but
clothing
was
so
much
needed
that
it
was
seized
as
fast
as
made
up
a
regiment
was
glad
to
get
a
dozen
suits
at
a
time
i
had
to
look
after
this
matter
for
the
infantry
then
our
regimental
fund
had
run
down
and
some
of
the
musicians
in
the
band
had
been
without
their
extra
pay
for
a
number
of
months
the
regimental
bands
at
that
day
were
kept
up
partly
by
pay
from
the
government
and
partly
by
pay
from
the
regimental
fund
there
was
authority
of
law
for
enlisting
a
certain
number
of
men
as
musicians
so
many
could
receive
the
pay
of
officers
of
the
various
grades
and
the
remainder
the
pay
of
privates
this
would
not
secure
a
band
leader
nor
good
players
on
certain
instruments
in
garrison
there
are
various
ways
of
keeping
up
a
regimental
fund
sufficient
to
give
extra
pay
to
musicians
establish
libraries
and
alleys
subscribe
to
magazines
and
furnish
many
extra
comforts
to
the
men
the
best
device
for
supplying
the
fund
is
to
issue
bread
to
the
soldiers
instead
of
flour
the
ration
used
to
be
eighteen
ounces
per
day
of
either
flour
or
bread
and
one
hundred
pounds
of
flour
will
make
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
of
bread
this
saving
was
purchased
by
the
commissary
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
in
the
emergency
the
infantry
was
laboring
under
i
rented
a
bakery
in
the
city
hired
bakers
mexicans
bought
fuel
and
whatever
was
necessary
and
i
also
got
a
contract
from
the
chief
commissary
of
the
army
for
baking
a
large
amount
of
hard
bread
in
two
months
i
made
more
money
for
the
fund
than
my
pay
amounted
to
during
the
entire
war
while
stationed
at
monterey
i
had
relieved
the
post
fund
in
the
same
way
there
however
was
no
profit
except
in
the
saving
of
flour
by
converting
it
into
bread
in
the
spring
of
a
party
of
officers
obtained
leave
to
visit
popocatapetl
the
highest
volcano
in
america
and
to
take
an
escort
i
went
with
the
party
many
of
whom
afterwards
occupied
conspicuous
positions
before
the
country
of
those
who
went
south
and
attained
high
rank
there
was
lieutenant
richard
anderson
who
commanded
a
corps
at
spottsylvania
captain
sibley
a
and
after
the
war
for
a
number
of
years
in
the
employ
of
the
khedive
of
egypt
captain
george
crittenden
a
rebel
general
buckner
who
surrendered
fort
donelson
and
mansfield
lovell
who
commanded
at
new
orleans
before
that
city
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
national
troops
of
those
who
remained
on
our
side
there
were
captain
andrew
porter
lieutenant
stone
and
lieutenant
z
b
tower
there
were
quite
a
number
of
other
officers
whose
names
i
can
not
recollect
at
a
little
village
ozumba
near
the
base
of
popocatapetl
where
we
purposed
to
commence
the
ascent
we
procured
guides
and
two
pack
mules
with
forage
for
our
horses
high
up
on
the
mountain
there
was
a
deserted
house
of
one
room
called
the
vaqueria
which
had
been
occupied
years
before
by
men
in
charge
of
cattle
ranging
on
the
mountain
the
pasturage
up
there
was
very
fine
when
we
saw
it
and
there
were
still
some
cattle
descendants
of
the
former
domestic
herd
which
had
now
become
wild
it
was
possible
to
go
on
horseback
as
far
as
the
vaqueria
though
the
road
was
somewhat
hazardous
in
places
sometimes
it
was
very
narrow
with
a
yawning
precipice
on
one
side
hundreds
of
feet
down
to
a
roaring
mountain
torrent
below
and
almost
perpendicular
walls
on
the
other
side
at
one
of
these
places
one
of
our
mules
loaded
with
two
sacks
of
barley
one
on
each
side
the
two
about
as
big
as
he
was
struck
his
load
against
the
and
was
precipitated
to
the
bottom
the
descent
was
steep
but
not
perpendicular
the
mule
rolled
over
and
over
until
the
bottom
was
reached
and
we
supposed
of
course
the
poor
animal
was
dashed
to
pieces
what
was
our
surprise
not
long
after
we
had
gone
into
bivouac
to
see
the
lost
mule
cargo
and
owner
coming
up
the
ascent
the
load
had
protected
the
animal
from
serious
injury
and
his
owner
had
gone
after
him
and
found
a
way
back
to
the
path
leading
up
to
the
hut
where
we
were
to
stay
the
night
at
the
vaqueria
was
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
i
ever
knew
it
was
very
cold
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
a
little
higher
up
the
rain
ceased
and
snow
began
the
wind
blew
with
great
velocity
the
we
were
in
had
lost
the
roof
entirely
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
it
was
hardly
better
then
a
sieve
there
was
little
or
no
sleep
that
night
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
next
morning
we
started
to
make
the
ascent
to
the
summit
the
wind
continued
to
blow
with
violence
and
the
weather
was
still
cloudy
but
there
was
neither
rain
nor
snow
the
clouds
however
concealed
from
our
view
the
country
below
us
except
at
times
a
momentary
glimpse
could
be
got
through
a
clear
space
between
them
the
wind
carried
the
loose
snow
around
the
in
such
volumes
as
to
make
it
almost
impossible
to
stand
up
against
it
we
labored
on
and
on
until
it
became
evident
that
the
top
could
not
be
reached
before
night
if
at
all
in
such
a
storm
and
we
concluded
to
return
the
descent
was
easy
and
rapid
though
dangerous
until
we
got
below
the
snow
line
at
the
cabin
we
mounted
our
horses
and
by
night
were
at
ozumba
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
the
loss
of
sleep
the
night
before
drove
us
to
bed
early
our
beds
consisted
of
a
place
on
the
with
a
blanket
under
us
soon
all
were
asleep
but
long
before
morning
first
one
and
then
another
of
our
party
began
to
cry
out
with
excruciating
pain
in
the
eyes
not
one
escaped
it
by
morning
the
eyes
of
half
the
party
were
so
swollen
that
they
were
entirely
closed
the
others
suffered
pain
equally
the
feeling
was
about
what
might
be
expected
from
the
prick
of
a
sharp
needle
at
a
white
heat
we
remained
in
quarters
until
the
afternoon
bathing
our
eyes
in
cold
water
this
relieved
us
very
much
and
before
night
the
pain
had
entirely
left
the
swelling
however
continued
and
about
half
the
party
still
had
their
eyes
entirely
closed
but
we
concluded
to
make
a
start
back
those
who
could
see
a
little
leading
the
horses
of
those
who
could
not
see
at
all
we
moved
back
to
the
village
of
ameca
ameca
some
six
miles
and
stopped
again
for
the
night
the
next
morning
all
were
entirely
well
and
free
from
pain
the
weather
was
clear
and
popocatapetl
stood
out
in
all
its
beauty
the
top
looking
as
if
not
a
mile
away
and
inviting
us
to
return
about
half
the
party
were
anxious
to
try
the
ascent
again
and
concluded
to
do
so
the
remainder
i
was
with
the
remainder
concluded
that
we
had
got
all
the
pleasure
there
was
to
be
had
out
of
mountain
climbing
and
that
we
would
visit
the
great
caves
of
mexico
some
ninety
miles
from
where
we
then
were
on
the
road
to
acapulco
the
party
that
ascended
the
mountain
the
second
time
succeeded
in
reaching
the
crater
at
the
top
with
but
little
of
the
labor
they
encountered
in
their
first
attempt
three
of
them
anderson
stone
and
buckner
wrote
accounts
of
their
journey
which
were
published
at
the
time
i
made
no
notes
of
this
excursion
and
have
read
nothing
about
it
since
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
see
the
whole
of
it
as
vividly
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
i
have
been
back
at
ameca
ameca
and
the
village
beyond
twice
in
the
last
five
years
the
scene
had
not
changed
materially
from
my
recollection
of
it
the
party
which
i
was
with
moved
south
down
the
valley
to
the
town
of
cuantla
some
forty
miles
from
ameca
ameca
the
latter
stands
on
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
popocatapetl
at
an
elevation
of
about
eight
thousand
feet
above
tide
water
the
slope
down
is
gradual
as
the
traveller
moves
south
but
one
would
not
judge
that
in
going
to
cuantla
descent
enough
had
been
made
to
occasion
a
material
change
in
the
climate
and
productions
of
the
soil
but
such
is
the
case
in
the
morning
we
left
a
temperate
climate
where
the
cereals
and
fruits
are
those
common
to
the
united
states
we
halted
in
the
evening
in
a
tropical
climate
where
the
orange
and
banana
the
coffee
and
the
were
flourishing
we
had
been
travelling
apparently
on
a
plain
all
day
but
in
the
direction
of
the
flow
of
water
soon
after
the
capture
of
the
city
of
mexico
an
armistice
had
been
agreed
to
designating
the
limits
beyond
which
troops
of
the
respective
armies
were
not
to
go
during
its
continuance
our
party
knew
nothing
about
these
limits
as
we
approached
cuantla
bugles
sounded
the
assembly
and
soldiers
rushed
from
the
in
the
edge
of
the
town
towards
us
our
party
halted
and
i
tied
a
white
pocket
handkerchief
to
a
stick
and
using
it
as
a
flag
of
truce
proceeded
on
to
the
town
captains
sibley
and
porter
followed
a
few
hundred
yards
behind
i
was
detained
at
the
until
a
messenger
could
be
dispatched
to
the
quarters
of
the
commanding
general
who
authorized
that
i
should
be
conducted
to
him
i
had
been
with
the
general
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
two
officers
following
announced
themselves
the
mexican
general
reminded
us
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
truce
for
us
to
be
there
however
as
we
had
no
special
authority
from
our
own
commanding
general
and
as
we
knew
nothing
about
the
terms
of
the
truce
we
were
permitted
to
occupy
a
vacant
house
outside
the
guard
for
the
night
with
the
promise
of
a
guide
to
put
us
on
the
road
to
cuernavaca
the
next
morning
cuernavaca
is
a
town
west
of
guantla
the
country
through
which
we
passed
between
these
two
towns
is
tropical
in
climate
and
productions
and
rich
in
scenery
at
one
point
about
between
the
two
places
the
road
goes
over
a
low
pass
in
the
mountains
in
which
there
is
a
very
quaint
old
town
the
inhabitants
of
which
at
that
day
were
nearly
all
indians
very
few
of
them
even
spoke
spanish
the
houses
were
built
of
stone
and
generally
only
one
story
high
the
streets
were
narrow
and
had
probably
been
paved
before
cortez
visited
the
country
they
had
not
been
graded
but
the
paving
had
been
done
on
the
natural
surface
we
had
with
us
one
vehicle
a
cart
which
was
probably
the
first
wheeled
vehicle
that
had
ever
passed
through
that
town
on
a
hill
overlooking
this
town
stands
the
tomb
of
an
ancient
king
and
it
was
understood
that
the
inhabitants
venerated
this
tomb
very
highly
as
well
as
the
memory
of
the
ruler
who
was
supposed
to
be
buried
in
it
we
ascended
the
mountain
and
surveyed
the
tomb
but
it
showed
no
particular
marks
of
architectural
taste
mechanical
skill
or
advanced
civilization
the
next
day
we
went
into
cuernavaca
after
a
day
rest
at
cuernavaca
our
party
set
out
again
on
the
journey
to
the
great
caves
of
mexico
we
had
proceeded
but
a
few
miles
when
we
were
stopped
as
before
by
a
guard
and
notified
that
the
terms
of
the
existing
armistice
did
not
permit
us
to
go
further
in
that
direction
upon
convincing
the
guard
that
we
were
a
mere
party
of
pleasure
seekers
desirous
of
visiting
the
great
natural
curiosities
of
the
country
which
we
expected
soon
to
leave
we
were
conducted
to
a
large
hacienda
near
by
and
directed
to
remain
there
until
the
commanding
general
of
that
department
could
be
communicated
with
and
his
decision
obtained
as
to
whether
we
should
be
permitted
to
pursue
our
journey
the
guard
promised
to
send
a
messenger
at
once
and
expected
a
reply
by
night
at
night
there
was
no
response
from
the
commanding
general
but
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
sure
he
would
have
a
reply
by
morning
again
in
the
morning
there
was
no
reply
the
second
evening
the
same
thing
happened
and
finally
we
learned
that
the
guard
had
sent
no
message
or
messenger
to
the
department
commander
we
determined
therefore
to
go
on
unless
stopped
by
a
force
sufficient
to
compel
obedience
after
a
few
hours
travel
we
came
to
a
town
where
a
scene
similar
to
the
one
at
cuantia
occurred
the
commanding
officer
sent
a
guide
to
conduct
our
party
around
the
village
and
to
put
us
upon
our
road
again
this
was
the
last
interruption
that
night
we
rested
at
a
large
coffee
plantation
some
eight
miles
from
the
cave
we
were
on
the
way
to
visit
it
must
have
been
a
saturday
night
the
peons
had
been
paid
off
and
spent
part
of
the
night
in
gambling
away
their
scanty
week
earnings
their
coin
was
principally
copper
and
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
man
among
them
who
had
received
as
much
as
cents
in
money
they
were
as
much
excited
however
as
if
they
had
been
staking
thousands
i
recollect
one
poor
fellow
who
had
lost
his
last
tlacko
pulled
off
his
shirt
and
in
the
most
excited
manner
put
that
up
on
the
turn
of
a
card
monte
was
the
game
played
the
place
out
of
doors
near
the
window
of
the
room
occupied
by
the
officers
of
our
party
the
next
morning
we
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
at
an
early
hour
provided
with
guides
candles
and
rockets
we
explored
to
a
distance
of
about
three
miles
from
the
entrance
and
found
a
succession
of
chambers
of
great
dimensions
and
of
great
beauty
when
lit
up
with
our
rockets
stalactites
and
stalagmites
of
all
sizes
were
discovered
some
of
the
former
were
many
feet
in
diameter
and
extended
from
ceiling
to
floor
some
of
the
latter
were
but
a
few
feet
high
from
the
floor
but
the
formation
is
going
on
constantly
and
many
centuries
hence
these
stalagmites
will
extend
to
the
ceiling
and
become
complete
columns
the
stalagmites
were
all
a
little
concave
and
the
cavities
were
filled
with
water
the
water
percolates
through
the
roof
a
drop
at
a
time
often
the
drops
several
minutes
apart
and
more
or
less
charged
with
mineral
matter
evaporation
goes
on
slowly
leaving
the
mineral
behind
this
in
time
makes
the
immense
columns
many
of
them
thousands
of
tons
in
weight
which
serve
to
support
the
roofs
over
the
vast
chambers
i
recollect
that
at
one
point
in
the
cave
one
of
these
columns
is
of
such
huge
proportions
that
there
is
only
a
narrow
passage
left
on
either
side
of
it
some
of
our
party
became
satisfied
with
their
explorations
before
we
had
reached
the
point
to
which
the
guides
were
accustomed
to
take
explorers
and
started
back
without
guides
coming
to
the
large
column
spoken
of
they
followed
it
entirely
around
and
commenced
retracing
their
steps
into
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
when
the
rest
of
us
had
completed
our
explorations
we
started
out
with
our
guides
but
had
not
gone
far
before
we
saw
the
torches
of
an
approaching
party
we
could
not
conceive
who
these
could
be
for
all
of
us
had
come
in
together
and
there
were
none
but
ourselves
at
the
entrance
when
we
started
in
very
soon
we
found
it
was
our
friends
it
took
them
some
time
to
conceive
how
they
had
got
where
they
were
they
were
sure
they
had
kept
straight
on
for
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
had
gone
about
far
enough
to
have
reached

arrival
at
san
francisco
my
experience
in
the
mexican
war
was
of
great
advantage
to
me
afterwards
besides
the
many
practical
lessons
it
taught
the
war
brought
nearly
all
the
officers
of
the
regular
army
together
so
as
to
make
them
personally
acquainted
it
also
brought
them
in
contact
with
volunteers
many
of
whom
served
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
afterwards
then
in
my
particular
case
i
had
been
at
west
point
at
about
the
right
time
to
meet
most
of
the
graduates
who
were
of
a
suitable
age
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
rebellion
to
be
trusted
with
large
commands
graduating
in
i
was
at
the
military
academy
from
one
to
four
years
with
all
cadets
who
graduated
between
and
seven
classes
these
classes
embraced
more
than
fifty
officers
who
afterwards
became
generals
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
rebellion
many
of
them
holding
high
commands
all
the
older
officers
who
became
conspicuous
in
the
rebellion
i
had
also
served
with
and
known
in
mexico
lee
johnston
johnston
holmes
hebert
and
a
number
of
others
on
the
confederate
side
mccall
mansfield
phil
kearney
and
others
on
the
national
side
the
acquaintance
thus
formed
was
of
immense
service
to
me
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
i
mean
what
i
learned
of
the
characters
of
those
to
whom
i
was
afterwards
opposed
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
all
movements
or
even
many
of
them
were
made
with
special
reference
to
the
characteristics
of
the
commander
against
whom
they
were
directed
but
my
appreciation
of
my
enemies
was
certainly
affected
by
this
knowledge
the
natural
disposition
of
most
people
is
to
clothe
a
commander
of
a
large
army
whom
they
do
not
know
with
almost
superhuman
abilities
a
large
part
of
the
national
army
for
instance
and
most
of
the
press
of
the
country
clothed
general
lee
with
just
such
qualities
but
i
had
known
him
personally
and
knew
that
he
was
mortal
and
it
was
just
as
well
that
i
felt
this
the
treaty
of
peace
was
at
last
ratified
and
the
evacuation
of
mexico
by
united
states
troops
was
ordered
early
in
june
the
troops
in
the
city
of
mexico
began
to
move
out
many
of
them
including
the
brigade
to
which
i
belonged
were
assembled
at
jalapa
above
the
vomito
to
await
the
arrival
of
transports
at
vera
cruz
but
with
all
this
precaution
my
regiment
and
others
were
in
camp
on
the
sand
beach
in
a
july
sun
for
about
a
week
before
embarking
while
the
fever
raged
with
great
virulence
in
vera
cruz
not
two
miles
away
i
can
call
to
mind
only
one
person
an
officer
who
died
of
the
disease
my
regiment
was
sent
to
pascagoula
mississippi
to
spend
the
summer
as
soon
as
it
was
settled
in
camp
i
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
for
four
months
and
proceeded
to
louis
on
the
of
august
i
was
married
to
miss
julia
dent
the
lady
of
whom
i
have
before
spoken
we
visited
my
parents
and
relations
in
ohio
and
at
the
end
of
my
leave
proceeded
to
my
post
at
sackett
harbor
new
york
in
april
following
i
was
ordered
to
detroit
michigan
where
two
years
were
spent
with
but
few
important
incidents
the
present
constitution
of
the
state
of
michigan
was
ratified
during
this
time
by
the
terms
of
one
of
its
provisions
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
within
the
state
at
the
time
of
the
ratification
became
citizens
of
michigan
also
during
my
stay
in
detroit
there
was
an
election
for
city
officers
zachariah
chandler
was
the
candidate
of
the
whigs
for
the
office
of
mayor
and
was
elected
although
the
city
was
then
reckoned
democratic
all
the
officers
stationed
there
at
the
time
who
offered
their
votes
were
permitted
to
cast
them
i
did
not
offer
mine
however
as
i
did
not
wish
to
consider
myself
a
citizen
of
michigan
this
was
chandler
first
entry
into
politics
a
career
he
followed
ever
after
with
great
success
and
in
which
he
died
enjoying
the
friendship
esteem
and
love
of
his
countrymen
in
the
spring
of
the
garrison
at
detroit
was
transferred
to
sackett
harbor
and
in
the
following
spring
the
entire
infantry
was
ordered
to
the
pacific
coast
it
was
decided
that
grant
should
visit
my
parents
at
first
for
a
few
months
and
then
remain
with
her
own
family
at
their
louis
home
until
an
opportunity
offered
of
sending
for
her
in
the
month
of
april
the
regiment
was
assembled
at
island
new
york
harbor
and
on
the
of
july
eight
companies
sailed
for
aspinwall
we
numbered
a
little
over
seven
hundred
persons
including
the
families
of
officers
and
soldiers
passage
was
secured
for
us
on
the
old
steamer
ohio
commanded
at
the
time
by
captain
schenck
of
the
navy
it
had
not
been
determined
until
a
day
or
two
before
starting
that
the
infantry
should
go
by
the
ohio
consequently
a
complement
of
passengers
had
already
been
secured
the
addition
of
over
seven
hundred
to
this
list
crowded
the
steamer
most
uncomfortably
especially
for
the
tropics
in
july
in
eight
days
aspinwall
was
reached
at
that
time
the
streets
of
the
town
were
eight
or
ten
inches
under
water
and
foot
passengers
passed
from
place
to
place
on
raised
july
is
at
the
height
of
the
wet
season
on
the
isthmus
at
intervals
the
rain
would
pour
down
in
streams
followed
in
not
many
minutes
by
a
blazing
tropical
sun
these
alternate
changes
from
rain
to
sunshine
were
continuous
in
the
afternoons
i
wondered
how
any
person
could
live
many
months
in
aspinwall
and
wondered
still
more
why
any
one
tried
in
the
summer
of
the
panama
railroad
was
completed
only
to
the
point
where
it
now
crosses
the
chagres
river
from
there
passengers
were
carried
by
boats
to
gorgona
at
which
place
they
took
mules
for
panama
some
miles
further
those
who
travelled
over
the
isthmus
in
those
days
will
remember
that
boats
on
the
chagres
river
were
propelled
by
natives
not
inconveniently
burdened
with
clothing
these
boats
carried
thirty
to
forty
passengers
each
the
crews
consisted
of
six
men
to
a
boat
armed
with
long
poles
there
were
planks
wide
enough
for
a
man
to
walk
on
conveniently
running
along
the
sides
of
each
boat
from
end
to
end
the
men
would
start
from
the
bow
place
one
end
of
their
poles
against
the
river
bottom
brace
their
shoulders
against
the
other
end
and
then
walk
to
the
stern
as
rapidly
as
they
could
in
this
way
from
a
mile
to
a
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
could
be
made
against
the
current
of
the
river
i
as
regimental
quartermaster
had
charge
of
the
public
property
and
had
also
to
look
after
the
transportation
a
contract
had
been
entered
into
with
the
steamship
company
in
new
york
for
the
transportation
of
the
regiment
to
california
including
the
isthmus
transit
a
certain
amount
of
baggage
was
allowed
per
man
and
saddle
animals
were
to
be
furnished
to
commissioned
officers
and
to
all
disabled
persons
the
regiment
with
the
exception
of
one
company
left
as
guards
to
the
public
property
camp
and
garrison
equipage
principally
and
the
soldiers
with
families
took
boats
propelled
as
above
described
for
gorgona
from
this
place
they
marched
to
panama
and
were
soon
comfortably
on
the
steamer
anchored
in
the
bay
some
three
or
four
miles
from
the
town
i
with
one
company
of
troops
and
all
the
soldiers
with
families
all
the
tents
mess
chests
and
camp
kettles
was
sent
to
cruces
a
town
a
few
miles
higher
up
the
chagres
river
than
gorgona
there
i
found
an
impecunious
american
who
had
taken
the
contract
to
furnish
transportation
for
the
regiment
at
a
stipulated
price
per
hundred
pounds
for
the
freight
and
so
much
for
each
saddle
animal
but
when
we
reached
cruces
there
was
not
a
mule
either
for
pack
or
saddle
in
the
place
the
contractor
promised
that
the
animals
should
be
on
hand
in
the
morning
in
the
morning
he
said
that
they
were
on
the
way
from
some
imaginary
place
and
would
arrive
in
the
course
of
the
day
this
went
on
until
i
saw
that
he
could
not
procure
the
animals
at
all
at
the
price
he
had
promised
to
furnish
them
for
the
unusual
number
of
passengers
that
had
come
over
on
the
steamer
and
the
large
amount
of
freight
to
pack
had
created
an
unprecedented
demand
for
mules
some
of
the
passengers
paid
as
high
as
forty
dollars
for
the
use
of
a
mule
to
ride
miles
when
the
mule
would
not
have
sold
for
ten
dollars
in
that
market
at
other
times
meanwhile
the
cholera
had
broken
out
and
men
were
dying
every
hour
to
diminish
the
food
for
the
disease
i
permitted
the
company
detailed
with
me
to
proceed
to
panama
the
captain
and
the
doctors
accompanied
the
men
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
sick
and
the
soldiers
who
had
families
the
regiment
at
panama
was
also
affected
with
the
disease
but
there
were
better
accommodations
for
the
well
on
the
steamer
and
a
hospital
for
those
taken
with
the
disease
on
an
old
hulk
anchored
a
mile
off
there
were
also
hospital
tents
on
shore
on
the
island
of
flamingo
which
stands
in
the
bay
i
was
about
a
week
at
cruces
before
transportation
began
to
come
in
about
of
the
people
with
me
died
either
at
cruces
or
on
the
way
to
panama
there
was
no
agent
of
the
transportation
company
at
cruces
to
consult
or
to
take
the
responsibility
of
procuring
transportation
at
a
price
which
would
secure
it
i
therefore
myself
dismissed
the
contractor
and
made
a
new
contract
with
a
native
at
more
than
double
the
original
price
thus
we
finally
reached
panama
the
steamer
however
could
not
proceed
until
the
cholera
abated
and
the
regiment
was
detained
still
longer
altogether
on
the
isthmus
and
on
the
pacific
side
we
were
delayed
six
weeks
about
of
those
who
left
new
york
harbor
with
the
infantry
on
the
of
july
now
lie
buried
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
or
on
flamingo
island
in
panama
bay
one
amusing
circumstance
occurred
while
we
were
lying
at
anchor
in
panama
bay
in
the
regiment
there
was
a
lieutenant
slaughter
who
was
very
liable
to
it
almost
made
him
sick
to
see
the
wave
of
a
when
the
servants
were
spreading
it
soon
after
his
graduation
slaughter
was
ordered
to
california
and
took
passage
by
a
sailing
vessel
going
around
cape
horn
the
vessel
was
seven
months
making
the
voyage
and
slaughter
was
sick
every
moment
of
the
time
never
more
so
than
while
lying
at
anchor
after
reaching
his
place
of
destination
on
landing
in
california
he
found
orders
which
had
come
by
the
isthmus
notifying
him
of
a
mistake
in
his
assignment
he
should
have
been
ordered
to
the
northern
lakes
he
started
back
by
the
isthmus
route
and
was
sick
all
the
way
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
east
he
was
again
ordered
to
california
this
time
definitely
and
at
this
date
was
making
his
third
trip
he
was
as
sick
as
ever
and
had
been
so
for
more
than
a
month
while
lying
at
anchor
in
the
bay
i
remember
him
well
seated
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
his
chin
between
his
hands
and
looking
the
picture
of
despair
at
last
he
broke
out
i
wish
i
had
taken
my
father
advice
he
wanted
me
to
go
into
the
navy
if
i
had
done
so
i
should
not
have
had
to
go
to
sea
so
much
poor
slaughter
it
was
his
last
sea
voyage
he
was
killed
by
indians
in
oregon
by
the
last
of
august
the
cholera
had
so
abated
that
it
was
deemed
safe
to
start
the
disease
did
not
break
out
again
on
the
way
to
california
and
we
reached

steamers
plied
daily
between

and
gold
from

by

when
these

arrived

there
was

one
wharf
in

in
was
alive
with
people
crowding
to
meet
the
miners
as
they
came
down
to
sell
their
dust
and
to
have
a
time
of
these
some
were
runners
for
hotels
boarding
houses
or
restaurants
others
belonged
to
a
class
of
impecunious
adventurers
of
good
manners
and
good
presence
who
were
ever
on
the
alert
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
people
with
some
ready
means
in
the
hope
of
being
asked
to
take
a
meal
at
a
restaurant
many
were
young
men
of
good
family
good
education
and
gentlemanly
instincts
their
parents
had
been
able
to
support
them
during
their
minority
and
to
give
them
good
educations
but
not
to
maintain
them
afterwards
from
to
there
was
a
rush
of
people
to

the
class

all
thought
that
fortunes
were
to
be
picked
up

realized
more
than
their
most
sanguine
expectations
but
for
one
such
there
were
hundreds
disappointed
many
of
whom
now
fill
unknown
graves
others
died
wrecks
of
their
former
selves
and
many
without
a
vicious
instinct
became
criminals
and
outcasts
many
of
the
real
scenes
in
early
california
life
exceed
in
strangeness
and
interest
any
of
the

products
of
the

of

novelist
those
early
days
in
california
brought

it
was
a
long
way
off
then
and
the
journey
was
expensive
the
fortunate
could
go
by
cape

or
by
the
isthmus
of
panama
but
the
mass
of
pioneers
crossed
the
plains
with
their
this
took
an
entire
summer
they
were
very
lucky
when
they
got
through
with
a
yoke
of
cattle
all
other
means
were
exhausted
in
procuring
the
outfit
on
the
missouri
river
the
immigrant
on
arriving
found
himself
a
stranger
in

strange

from

not
support

at

many
became
discouraged
others
would
take
off
their
coats
and
look
for
a
job
no
matter
what
it
might
be
these
succeeded
as
a
rule
there
were
many
young
men
who
had
studied
professions
before
they
went
to
california
and
who
had
never
done
a

manual
labor
in

situation
at
once
and
went
to
work
to
make
a
start
at
anything
they
could
get
to
do
some
supplied
carpenters
and
masons
with
material
carrying
plank
brick
or
mortar
as
the
case
might
be
others
drove
stages
drays
or
baggage
wagons
until
they
could
do
better
more
became
discouraged
early
and
spent
their
time
looking
up
people
who
would
treat
or
lounging
about
restaurants
and
gambling
houses
where
free
lunches
were
furnished
daily
they
were
welcomed
at
these
places
because
they
often
brought
in
miners
who
proved
good
customers
my
regiment
spent
a
few
weeks
at
benicia
barracks
and
then
was
ordered
to
fort
vancouver
on
the
columbia
river
then
in
oregon
territory
during
the
winter
of
the
territory
was
divided
all
north
of
the
columbia
river
being
taken
from
oregon
to
make
washington
territory
prices
for
all
kinds
of
supplies
were
so
high
on
the
pacific
coast
from
until
at
least
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
officers
of
the
army
to
exist
upon
their
pay
if
it
had
not
been
that
authority
was
given
them
to
purchase
from
the
commissary
such
supplies
as
he
kept
at
new
orleans
wholesale
prices
a
cook
could
not
be
hired
for
the
pay
of
a
captain
the
cook
could
do
better
at
benicia
in
flour
was
cents
per
pound
potatoes
were
cents
beets
turnips
and
cabbage
cents
onions
cents
meat
and
other
articles
in
proportion
in
at
vancouver
vegetables
were
a
little
lower
i
with
three
other
officers
concluded
that
we
would
raise
a
crop
for
ourselves
and
by
selling
the
surplus
realize
something
handsome
i
bought
a
pair
of
horses
that
had
crossed
the
plains
that
summer
and
were
very
poor
they
recuperated
rapidly
however
and
proved
a
good
team
to
break
up
the
ground
with
i
performed
all
the
labor
of
breaking
up
the
ground
while
the
other
officers
planted
the
potatoes
our
crop
was
enormous
luckily
for
us
the
columbia
river
rose
to
a
great
height
from
the
melting
of
the
snow
in
the
mountains
in
june
and
overflowed
and
killed
most
of
our
crop
this
saved
digging
it
up
for
everybody
on
the
pacific
coast
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
conclusion
at
the
same
time
that
agriculture
would
be
profitable
in
more
than
of
the
potatoes
raised
were
permitted
to
rot
in
the
ground
or
had
to
be
thrown
away
the
only
potatoes
we
sold
were
to
our
own
mess
while
i
was
stationed
on
the
pacific
coast
we
were
free
from
indian
wars
there
were
quite
a
number
of
remnants
of
tribes
in
the
vicinity
of
portland
in
oregon
and
of
fort
vancouver
in
washington
territory
they
had
generally
acquired
some
of
the
vices
of
civilization
but
none
of
the
virtues
except
in
individual
cases
the
hudson
bay
company
had
held
the
with
their
trading
posts
for
many
years
before
the
united
states
was
represented
on
the
pacific
coast
they
still
retained
posts
along
the
columbia
river
and
one
at
fort
vancouver
when
i
was
there
their
treatment
of
the
indians
had
brought
out
the
better
qualities
of
the
savages
farming
had
been
undertaken
by
the
company
to
supply
the
indians
with
bread
and
vegetables
they
raised
some
cattle
and
horses
and
they
had
now
taught
the
indians
to
do
the
labor
of
the
farm
and
herd
they
always
compensated
them
for
their
labor
and
always
gave
them
goods
of
uniform
quality
and
at
uniform
price
before
the
advent
of
the
american
the
medium
of
exchange
between
the
indian
and
the
white
man
was
pelts
afterward
it
was
silver
coin
if
an
indian
received
in
the
sale
of
a
horse
a
fifty
dollar
gold
piece
not
an
infrequent
occurrence
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
exchange
it
for
american
half
dollars
these
he
could
count
he
would
then
commence
his
purchases
paying
for
each
article
separately
as
he
got
it
he
would
not
trust
any
one
to
add
up
the
bill
and
pay
it
all
at
once
at
that
day
fifty
dollar
gold
pieces
not
the
issue
of
the
government
were
common
on
the
pacific
coast
they
were
called
slugs
the
indians
along
the
lower
columbia
as
far
as
the
cascades
and
on
the
lower
willamette
died
off
very
fast
during
the
year
i
spent
in
that
section
for
besides
acquiring
the
vices
of
the
white
people
they
had
acquired
also
their
diseases
the
measles
and
the
were
both
amazingly
fatal
in
their
wild
state
before
the
appearance
of
the
white
man
among
them
the
principal
complaints
they
were
subject
to
were
those
produced
by
long
involuntary
fasting
violent
exercise
in
pursuit
of
game
and
instinct
more
than
reason
had
taught
them
a
remedy
for
these
ills
it
was
the
steam
bath
something
like
a
was
built
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
lying
down
bushes
were
stuck
in
the
ground
in
two
rows
about
six
feet
long
and
some
two
or
three
feet
apart
other
bushes
connected
the
rows
at
one
end
the
tops
of
the
bushes
were
drawn
together
to
interlace
and
confined
in
that
position
the
whole
was
then
plastered
over
with
wet
clay
until
every
opening
was
filled
just
inside
the
open
end
of
the
oven
the
floor
was
scooped
out
so
as
to
make
a
hole
that
would
hold
a
bucket
or
two
of
water
these
ovens
were
always
built
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
a
big
spring
or
pool
of
water
when
a
patient
required
a
bath
a
fire
was
built
near
the
oven
and
a
pile
of
stones
put
upon
it
the
cavity
at
the
front
was
then
filled
with
water
when
the
stones
were
sufficiently
heated
the
patient
would
draw
himself
into
the
oven
a
blanket
would
be
thrown
over
the
open
end
and
hot
stones
put
into
the
water
until
the
patient
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
was
then
withdrawn
from
his
steam
bath
and
doused
into
the
cold
stream
near
by
this
treatment
may
have
answered
with
the
early
ailments
of
the
indians
with
the
measles
or
it
would
kill
every
time
during
my
year
on
the
columbia
river
the
exterminated
one
small
remnant
of
a
band
of
indians
entirely
and
reduced
others
materially
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
case
of
recovery
among
them
until
the
doctor
with
the
hudson
bay
company
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
established
a
hospital
nearly
every
case
he
treated
recovered
i
never
myself
saw
the
treatment
described
in
the
preceding
paragraph
but
have
heard
it
described
by
persons
who
have
witnessed
it
the
decimation
among
the
indians
i
knew
of
personally
and
the
hospital
established
for
their
benefit
was
a
hudson
bay
building
not
a
throw
from
my
own
quarters
the
death
of
colonel
bliss
of
the
adjutant
general
department
which
occurred
july
promoted
me
to
the
captaincy
of
a
company
then
stationed
at
humboldt
bay
california
the
notice
reached
me
in
september
of
the
same
year
and
i
very
soon
started
to
join
my
new
command
there
was
no
way
of
reaching
humboldt
at
that
time
except
to
take
passage
on
a
san
francisco
sailing
vessel
going
after
lumber
red
wood
a
species
of
cedar
which
on
the
pacific
coast
takes
the
place
filled
by
white
pine
in
the
east
then
abounded
on
the
banks
of
humboldt
bay
there
were
extensive
engaged
in
preparing
this
lumber
for
the
san
francisco
market
and
sailing
vessels
used
in
getting
it
to
market
furnished
the
only
means
of
communication
between
humboldt
and
the
balance
of
the
world
i
was
obliged
to
remain
in
san
francisco
for
several
days
before
i
found
a
vessel
this
gave
me
a
good
opportunity
of
comparing
the
san
francisco
of
with
that
of
as
before
stated
there
had
been
but
one
wharf
in
front
of
the
city
in
long
wharf
in
the
town
had
grown
out
into
the
bay
beyond
what
was
the
end
of
this
wharf
when
i
first
saw
it
streets
and
houses
had
been
built
out
on
piles
where
the
year
before
the
largest
vessels
visiting
the
port
lay
at
anchor
or
tied
to
the
wharf
there
was
no
filling
under
the
streets
or
houses
san
francisco
presented
the
same
general
appearance
as
the
year
before
that
is
eating
drinking
and
gambling
houses
were
conspicuous
for
their
number
and
publicity
they
were
on
the
first
floor
with
doors
wide
open
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
in
walking
the
streets
the
eye
was
regaled
on
every
block
near
the
water
front
by
the
sight
of
players
at
faro
often
broken
places
were
found
in
the
street
large
enough
to
let
a
man
down
into
the
water
below
i
have
but
little
doubt
that
many
of
the
people
who
went
to
the
pacific
coast
in
the
early
days
of
the
gold
excitement
and
have
never
been
heard
from
since
or
who
were
heard
from
for
a
time
and
then
ceased
to
write
found
watery
graves
beneath
the
houses
or
streets
built
over
san
francisco
bay
besides
the
gambling
in
cards
there
was
gambling
on
a
larger
scale
in
city
lots
these
were
sold
on
change
much
as
stocks
are
now
sold
on
wall
street
cash
at
time
of
purchase
was
always
paid
by
the
broker
but
the
purchaser
had
only
to
put
up
his
margin
he
was
charged
at
the
rate
of
two
or
three
per
cent
a
month
on
the
difference
besides
commissions
the
sand
hills
some
of
them
almost
inaccessible
to
were
surveyed
off
and
mapped
into
fifty
vara
lots
a
vara
being
a
spanish
yard
these
were
sold
at
first
at
very
low
prices
but
were
sold
and
resold
for
higher
prices
until
they
went
up
to
many
thousands
of
dollars
the
brokers
did
a
fine
business
and
so
did
many
such
purchasers
as
were
sharp
enough
to
quit
purchasing
before
the
final
crash
came
as
the
city
grew
the
sand
hills
back
of
the
town
furnished
material
for
filling
up
the
bay
under
the
houses
and
streets
and
still
further
out
the
temporary
houses
first
built
over
the
water
in
the
harbor
soon
gave
way
to
more
solid
structures
the
main
business
part
of
the
city
now
is
on
solid
ground
made
where
vessels
of
the
largest
class
lay
at
anchor
in
the
early
days
i
was
in
san
francisco
again
in
gambling
houses
had
disappeared
from
public
view
the
city
had
become
staid
and
orderly

at
galena
the
coming
crisis
my
family
all
this
while
was
at
the
east
it
consisted
now
of
a
wife
and
two
children
i
saw
no
chance
of
supporting
them
on
the
pacific
coast
out
of
my
pay
as
an
army
officer
i
concluded
therefore
to
resign
and
in
march
applied
for
a
leave
of
absence
until
the
end
of
the
july
following
tendering
my
resignation
to
take
effect
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
left
the
pacific
coast
very
much
attached
to
it
and
with
the
full
expectation
of
making
it
my
future
home
that
expectation
and
that
hope
remained
uppermost
in
my
mind
until
the
bill
was
introduced
into
congress
in
the
winter
of
the
passage
of
that
bill
and
my
promotion
blasted
my
last
hope
of
ever
becoming
a
citizen
of
the
further
west
in
the
late
summer
of
i
rejoined
my
family
to
find
in
it
a
son
whom
i
had
never
seen
born
while
i
was
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
i
was
now
to
commence
at
the
age
of
a
new
struggle
for
our
support
my
wife
had
a
farm
near
louis
to
which
we
went
but
i
had
no
means
to
stock
it
a
house
had
to
be
built
also
i
worked
very
hard
never
losing
a
day
because
of
bad
weather
and
accomplished
the
object
in
a
moderate
way
if
nothing
else
could
be
done
i
would
load
a
cord
of
wood
on
a
wagon
and
take
it
to
the
city
for
sale
i
managed
to
keep
along
very
well
until
when
i
was
attacked
by
fever
and
ague
i
had
suffered
very
severely
and
for
a
long
time
from
this
disease
while
a
boy
in
ohio
it
lasted
now
over
a
year
and
while
it
did
not
keep
me
in
the
house
it
did
interfere
greatly
with
the
amount
of
work
i
was
able
to
perform
in
the
fall
of
i
sold
out
my
stock
crops
and
farming
utensils
at
auction
and
gave
up
farming
in
the
winter
i
established
a
partnership
with
harry
boggs
a
cousin
of
grant
in
the
real
estate
agency
business
i
spent
that
winter
at
louis
myself
but
did
not
take
my
family
into
town
until
the
spring
our
business
might
have
become
prosperous
if
i
had
been
able
to
wait
for
it
to
grow
as
it
was
there
was
no
more
than
one
person
could
attend
to
and
not
enough
to
support
two
families
while
a
citizen
of
louis
and
engaged
in
the
real
estate
agency
business
i
was
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
county
engineer
an
office
of
respectability
and
emolument
which
would
have
been
very
acceptable
to
me
at
that
time
the
incumbent
was
appointed
by
the
county
court
which
consisted
of
five
members
my
opponent
had
the
advantage
of
birth
over
me
he
was
a
citizen
by
adoption
and
carried
off
the
prize
i
now
withdrew
from
the
with
boggs
and
in
may
removed
to
galena
illinois
and
took
a
clerkship
in
my
father
store
while
a
citizen
of
missouri
my
first
opportunity
for
casting
a
vote
at
a
presidential
election
occurred
i
had
been
in
the
army
from
before
attaining
my
majority
and
had
thought
but
little
about
politics
although
i
was
a
whig
by
education
and
a
great
admirer
of
clay
but
the
whig
party
had
ceased
to
exist
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
exercising
the
privilege
of
casting
a
ballot
the
party
had
taken
its
place
but
was
on
the
wane
and
the
republican
party
was
in
a
chaotic
state
and
had
not
yet
received
a
name
it
had
no
existence
in
the
slave
states
except
at
points
on
the
borders
next
to
free
states
in
louis
city
and
county
what
afterwards
became
the
republican
party
was
known
as
the
democracy
led
by
the
honorable
frank
blair
most
of
my
neighbors
had
known
me
as
an
officer
of
the
army
with
whig
proclivities
they
had
been
on
the
same
side
and
on
the
death
of
their
party
many
had
become
or
members
of
the
american
party
there
was
a
lodge
near
my
new
home
and
i
was
invited
to
join
it
i
accepted
the
invitation
was
initiated
attended
a
meeting
just
one
week
later
and
never
went
to
another
afterwards
i
have
no
apologies
to
make
for
having
been
one
week
a
member
of
the
american
party
for
i
still
think
citizens
of
the
united
states
should
have
as
much
protection
as
many
privileges
in
their
native
country
as
those
who
voluntarily
select
it
for
a
home
but
all
secret
political
parties
are
dangerous
to
any
nation
no
matter
how
pure
or
how
patriotic
the
motives
and
principles
which
first
bring
them
together
no
political
party
can
or
ought
to
exist
when
one
of
its
is
opposition
to
freedom
of
thought
and
to
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictate
of
one
own
conscience
or
according
to
the
creed
of
any
religious
denomination
whatever
nevertheless
if
a
sect
sets
up
its
laws
as
binding
above
the
state
laws
wherever
the
two
come
in
conflict
this
claim
must
be
resisted
and
suppressed
at
whatever
cost
up
to
the
mexican
war
there
were
a
few
out
and
out
abolitionists
men
who
carried
their
hostility
to
slavery
into
all
elections
from
those
for
a
justice
of
the
peace
up
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
they
were
noisy
but
not
numerous
but
the
great
majority
of
people
at
the
north
where
slavery
did
not
exist
were
opposed
to
the
institution
and
looked
upon
its
existence
in
any
part
of
the
country
as
unfortunate
they
did
not
hold
the
states
where
slavery
existed
responsible
for
it
and
believed
that
protection
should
be
given
to
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
until
some
satisfactory
way
could
be
reached
to
be
rid
of
the
institution
opposition
to
slavery
was
not
a
creed
of
either
political
party
in
some
sections
more
men
belonged
to
the
democratic
party
and
in
others
to
the
whigs
but
with
the
inauguration
of
the
mexican
war
in
fact
with
the
annexation
of
texas
the
inevitable
conflict
commenced
as
the
time
for
the
presidential
election
of
the
first
at
which
i
had
the
opportunity
of
voting
approached
party
feeling
began
to
run
high
the
republican
party
was
regarded
in
the
south
and
the
border
states
not
only
as
opposed
to
the
extension
of
slavery
but
as
favoring
the
compulsory
abolition
of
the
institution
without
compensation
to
the
owners
the
most
horrible
visions
seemed
to
present
themselves
to
the
minds
of
people
who
one
would
suppose
ought
to
have
known
better
many
educated
and
otherwise
sensible
persons
appeared
to
believe
that
emancipation
meant
social
equality
treason
to
the
government
was
openly
advocated
and
was
not
rebuked
it
was
evident
to
my
mind
that
the
election
of
a
republican
president
in
meant
the
secession
of
all
the
slave
states
and
rebellion
under
these
circumstances
i
preferred
the
success
of
a
candidate
whose
election
would
prevent
or
postpone
secession
to
seeing
the
country
plunged
into
a
war
the
end
of
which
no
man
could
foretell
with
a
democrat
elected
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
slave
states
there
could
be
no
pretext
for
secession
for
four
years
i
very
much
hoped
that
the
passions
of
the
people
would
subside
in
that
time
and
the
catastrophe
be
averted
altogether
if
it
was
not
i
believed
the
country
would
be
better
prepared
to
receive
the
shock
and
to
resist
it
i
therefore
voted
for
james
buchanan
for
president
four
years
later
the
republican
party
was
successful
in
electing
its
candidate
to
the
presidency
the
civilized
world
has
learned
the
consequence
four
millions
of
human
beings
held
as
chattels
have
been
liberated
the
ballot
has
been
given
to
them
the
free
schools
of
the
country
have
been
opened
to
their
children
the
nation
still
lives
and
the
people
are
just
as
free
to
avoid
social
intimacy
with
the
blacks
as
ever
they
were
or
as
they
are
with
white
people
while
living
in
galena
i
was
nominally
only
a
clerk
supporting
myself
and
family
on
a
stipulated
salary
in
reality
my
position
was
different
my
father
had
never
lived
in
galena
himself
but
had
established
my
two
brothers
there
the
one
next
younger
than
myself
in
charge
of
the
business
assisted
by
the
youngest
when
i
went
there
it
was
my
father
intention
to
give
up
all
connection
with
the
business
himself
and
to
establish
his
three
sons
in
it
but
the
brother
who
had
really
built
up
the
business
was
sinking
with
consumption
and
it
was
not
thought
best
to
make
any
change
while
he
was
in
this
condition
he
lived
until
september
when
he
succumbed
to
that
insidious
disease
which
always
flatters
its
victims
into
the
belief
that
they
are
growing
better
up
to
the
close
of
life
a
more
honorable
man
never
transacted
business
in
september
i
was
engaged
in
an
employment
which
required
all
my
attention
elsewhere
during
the
eleven
months
that
i
lived
in
galena
prior
to
the
first
call
for
volunteers
i
had
been
strictly
attentive
to
my
business
and
had
made
but
few
acquaintances
other
than
customers
and
people
engaged
in
the
same
line
with
myself
when
the
election
took
place
in
november
i
had
not
been
a
resident
of
illinois
long
enough
to
gain
citizenship
and
could
not
therefore
vote
i
was
really
glad
of
this
at
the
time
for
my
pledges
would
have
compelled
me
to
vote
for
stephen
douglas
who
had
no
possible
chance
of
election
the
contest
was
really
between
breckinridge
and
lincoln
between
minority
rule
and
rule
by
the
majority
i
wanted
as
between
these
candidates
to
see
lincoln
elected
excitement
ran
high
during
the
canvass
and
processions
enlivened
the
scene
in
the
generally
quiet
streets
of
galena
many
nights
during
the
campaign
i
did
not
parade
with
either
party
but
occasionally
met
with
the
wide
awakes
republicans
in
their
rooms
and
superintended
their
drill
it
was
evident
from
the
time
of
the
chicago
nomination
to
the
close
of
the
canvass
that
the
election
of
the
republican
candidate
would
be
the
signal
for
some
of
the
southern
states
to
secede
i
still
had
hopes
that
the
four
years
which
had
elapsed
since
the
first
nomination
of
a
presidential
candidate
by
a
party
distinctly
opposed
to
slavery
extension
had
given
time
for
the
extreme
sentiment
to
cool
down
for
the
southerners
to
think
well
before
they
took
the
awful
leap
which
they
had
so
vehemently
threatened
but
i
was
mistaken
the
republican
candidate
was
elected
and
solid
substantial
people
of
the
and
i
presume
the
same
order
of
people
throughout
the
entire
north
felt
very
serious
but
determined
after
this
event
it
was
very
much
discussed
whether
the
south
would
carry
out
its
threat
to
secede
and
set
up
a
separate
government
the
of
which
should
be
protection
to
the
divine
institution
of
slavery
for
there
were
people
who
believed
in
the
divinity
of
human
slavery
as
there
are
now
people
who
believe
mormonism
and
polygamy
to
be
ordained
by
the
most
high
we
forgive
them
for
entertaining
such
notions
but
forbid
their
practice
it
was
generally
believed
that
there
would
be
a
flurry
that
some
of
the
extreme
southern
states
would
go
so
far
as
to
pass
ordinances
of
secession
but
the
common
impression
was
that
this
step
was
so
plainly
suicidal
for
the
south
that
the
movement
would
not
spread
over
much
of
the
territory
and
would
not
last
long
doubtless
the
founders
of
our
government
the
majority
of
them
at
least
regarded
the
confederation
of
the
colonies
as
an
experiment
each
colony
considered
itself
a
separate
government
that
the
confederation
was
for
mutual
protection
against
a
foreign
foe
and
the
prevention
of
strife
and
war
among
themselves
if
there
had
been
a
desire
on
the
part
of
any
single
state
to
withdraw
from
the
compact
at
any
time
while
the
number
of
states
was
limited
to
the
original
thirteen
i
do
not
suppose
there
would
have
been
any
to
contest
the
right
no
matter
how
much
the
determination
might
have
been
regretted
the
problem
changed
on
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
by
all
the
colonies
it
changed
still
more
when
amendments
were
added
and
if
the
right
of
any
one
state
to
withdraw
continued
to
exist
at
all
after
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
it
certainly
ceased
on
the
formation
of
new
states
at
least
so
far
as
the
new
states
themselves
were
concerned
it
was
never
possessed
at
all
by
florida
or
the
states
west
of
the
mississippi
all
of
which
were
purchased
by
the
treasury
of
the
entire
nation
texas
and
the
territory
brought
into
the
union
in
consequence
of
annexation
were
purchased
with
both
blood
and
treasure
and
texas
with
a
domain
greater
than
that
of
any
european
state
except
russia
was
permitted
to
retain
as
state
property
all
the
public
lands
within
its
borders
it
would
have
been
ingratitude
and
injustice
of
the
most
flagrant
sort
for
this
state
to
withdraw
from
the
union
after
all
that
had
been
spent
and
done
to
introduce
her
yet
if
separation
had
actually
occurred
texas
must
necessarily
have
gone
with
the
south
both
on
account
of
her
institutions
and
her
geographical
position
secession
was
illogical
as
well
as
impracticable
it
was
revolution
now
the
right
of
revolution
is
an
inherent
one
when
people
are
oppressed
by
their
government
it
is
a
natural
right
they
enjoy
to
relieve
themselves
of
the
oppression
if
they
are
strong
enough
either
by
withdrawal
from
it
or
by
overthrowing
it
and
substituting
a
government
more
acceptable
but
any
people
or
part
of
a
people
who
resort
to
this
remedy
stake
their
lives
their
property
and
every
claim
for
protection
given
by
citizenship
on
the
issue
victory
or
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
conqueror
must
be
the
result
in
the
case
of
the
war
between
the
states
it
would
have
been
the
exact
truth
if
the
south
had
said
we
do
not
want
to
live
with
you
northern
people
any
longer
we
know
our
institution
of
slavery
is
obnoxious
to
you
and
as
you
are
growing
numerically
stronger
than
we
it
may
at
some
time
in
the
future
be
endangered
so
long
as
you
permitted
us
to
control
the
government
and
with
the
aid
of
a
few
friends
at
the
north
to
enact
laws
constituting
your
section
a
guard
against
the
escape
of
our
property
we
were
willing
to
live
with
you
you
have
been
submissive
to
our
rule
heretofore
but
it
looks
now
as
if
you
did
not
intend
to
continue
so
and
we
will
remain
in
the
union
no
longer
instead
of
this
the
seceding
states
cried
lustily
let
us
alone
you
have
no
constitutional
power
to
interfere
with
us
newspapers
and
people
at
the
north
reiterated
the
cry
individuals
might
ignore
the
constitution
but
the
nation
itself
must
not
only
obey
it
but
must
enforce
the
strictest
construction
of
that
instrument
the
construction
put
upon
it
by
the
southerners
themselves
the
fact
is
the
constitution
did
not
apply
to
any
such
contingency
as
the
one
existing
from
to
its
framers
never
dreamed
of
such
a
contingency
occurring
if
they
had
foreseen
it
the
probabilities
are
they
would
have
sanctioned
the
right
of
a
state
or
states
to
withdraw
rather
than
that
there
should
be
war
between
brothers
the
framers
were
wise
in
their
generation
and
wanted
to
do
the
very
best
possible
to
secure
their
own
liberty
and
independence
and
that
also
of
their
descendants
to
the
latest
days
it
is
preposterous
to
suppose
that
the
people
of
one
generation
can
lay
down
the
best
and
only
rules
of
government
for
all
who
are
to
come
after
them
and
under
unforeseen
contingencies
at
the
time
of
the
framing
of
our
constitution
the
only
physical
forces
that
had
been
subdued
and
made
to
serve
man
and
do
his
labor
were
the
currents
in
the
streams
and
in
the
air
we
breathe
rude
machinery
propelled
by
water
power
had
been
invented
sails
to
propel
ships
upon
the
waters
had
been
set
to
catch
the
passing
breeze
but
the
application
of
stream
to
propel
vessels
against
both
wind
and
current
and
machinery
to
do
all
manner
of
work
had
not
been
thought
of
the
instantaneous
transmission
of
messages
around
the
world
by
means
of
electricity
would
probably
at
that
day
have
been
attributed
to
witchcraft
or
a
league
with
the
devil
immaterial
circumstances
had
changed
as
greatly
as
material
ones
we
could
not
and
ought
not
to
be
rigidly
bound
by
the
rules
laid
down
under
circumstances
so
different
for
emergencies
so
utterly
unanticipated
the
fathers
themselves
would
have
been
the
first
to
declare
that
their
prerogatives
were
not
irrevocable
they
would
surely
have
resisted
secession
could
they
have
lived
to
see
the
shape
it
assumed
i
travelled
through
the
northwest
considerably
during
the
winter
of
we
had
customers
in
all
the
little
towns
in
wisconsin
minnesota
and
iowa
these
generally
knew
i
had
been
a
captain
in
the
regular
army
and
had
served
through
the
mexican
war
consequently
wherever
i
stopped
at
night
some
of
the
people
would
come
to
the
where
i
was
and
sit
till
a
late
hour
discussing
the
probabilities
of
the
future
my
own
views
at
that
time
were
like
those
officially
expressed
by
seward
at
a
later
day
that
the
war
would
be
over
in
ninety
days
i
continued
to
entertain
these
views
until
after
the
battle
of
shiloh
i
believe
now
that
there
would
have
been
no
more
battles
at
the
west
after
the
capture
of
fort
donelson
if
all
the
troops
in
that
region
had
been
under
a
single
commander
who
would
have
followed
up
that
victory
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
now
that
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
the
south
would
have
been
opposed
to
secession
in
and
if
there
had
been
a
fair
and
calm
expression
of
opinion
unbiased
by
threats
and
if
the
ballot
of
one
legal
voter
had
counted
for
as
much
as
that
of
any
other
but
there
was
no
calm
discussion
of
the
question
demagogues
who
were
too
old
to
enter
the
army
if
there
should
be
a
war
others
who
entertained
so
high
an
opinion
of
their
own
ability
that
they
did
not
believe
they
could
be
spared
from
the
direction
of
the
affairs
of
state
in
such
an
event
declaimed
vehemently
and
unceasingly
against
the
north
against
its
aggressions
upon
the
south
its
interference
with
southern
rights
etc
they
denounced
the
northerners
as
cowards
poltroons
claimed
that
one
southern
man
was
equal
to
five
northern
men
in
battle
that
if
the
south
would
stand
up
for
its
rights
the
north
would
back
down
jefferson
davis
said
in
a
speech
delivered
at
la
grange
mississippi
before
the
secession
of
that
state
that
he
would
agree
to
drink
all
the
blood
spilled
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
if
there
should
be
a
war
the
young
men
who
would
have
the
fighting
to
do
in
case
of
war
believed
all
these
statements
both
in
regard
to
the
aggressiveness
of
the
north
and
its
cowardice
they
too
cried
out
for
a
separation
from
such
people
the
great
bulk
of
the
legal
voters
of
the
south
were
men
who
owned
no
slaves
their
homes
were
generally
in
the
hills
and
poor
country
their
facilities
for
educating
their
children
even
up
to
the
point
of
reading
and
writing
were
very
limited
their
interest
in
the
contest
was
very
meagre
what
there
was
if
they
had
been
capable
of
seeing
it
was
with
the
north
they
too
needed
emancipation
under
the
old
regime
they
were
looked
down
upon
by
those
who
controlled
all
the
affairs
in
the
interest
of
as
poor
white
trash
who
were
allowed
the
ballot
so
long
as
they
cast
it
according
to
direction
i
am
aware
that
this
last
statement
may
be
disputed
and
individual
testimony
perhaps
adduced
to
show
that
in
days
the
ballot
was
as
untrammelled
in
the
south
as
in
any
section
of
the
country
but
in
the
face
of
any
such
contradiction
i
reassert
the
statement
the
was
not
resorted
to
masked
men
did
not
ride
over
the
country
at
night
intimidating
voters
but
there
was
a
firm
feeling
that
a
class
existed
in
every
state
with
a
sort
of
divine
right
to
control
public
affairs
if
they
could
not
get
this
control
by
one
means
they
must
by
another
the
end
justified
the
means
the
coercion
if
mild
was
complete
there
were
two
political
parties
it
is
true
in
all
the
states
both
strong
in
numbers
and
respectability
but
both
equally
loyal
to
the
institution
which
stood
paramount
in
southern
eyes
to
all
other
institutions
in
state
or
nation
the
were
the
minority
but
governed
both
parties
had
politics
ever
divided
the
and
the
the
majority
would
have
been
obliged
to
yield
or
internecine
war
would
have
been
the
consequence
i
do
not
know
that
the
southern
people
were
to
blame
for
this
condition
of
affairs
there
was
a
time
when
slavery
was
not
profitable
and
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
the
institution
was
confined
almost
exclusively
to
the
territory
where
it
existed
the
states
of
virginia
and
kentucky
came
near
abolishing
slavery
by
their
own
acts
one
state
defeating
the
measure
by
a
tie
vote
and
the
other
only
lacking
one
but
when
the
institution
became
profitable
all
talk
of
its
abolition
ceased
where
it
existed
and
naturally
as
human
nature
is
constituted
arguments
were
adduced
in
its
support
the
probably
had
much
to
do
with
the
justification
of
slavery
the
winter
of
will
be
remembered
by
people
of
as
one
of
great
excitement
south
carolina
promptly
seceded
after
the
result
of
the
presidential
election
was
known
other
southern
states
proposed
to
follow
in
some
of
them
the
union
sentiment
was
so
strong
that
it
had
to
be
suppressed
by
force
maryland
delaware
kentucky
and
missouri
all
slave
states
failed
to
pass
ordinances
of
secession
but
they
were
all
represented
in
the
congress
of
the
confederate
states
the
governor
and
of
missouri
in
jackson
and
reynolds
were
both
supporters
of
the
rebellion
and
took
refuge
with
the
enemy
the
governor
soon
died
and
the
assumed
his
office
issued
proclamations
as
governor
of
the
state
was
recognized
as
such
by
the
confederate
government
and
continued
his
pretensions
until
the
collapse
of
the
rebellion
the
south
claimed
the
sovereignty
of
states
but
claimed
the
right
to
coerce
into
their
confederation
such
states
as
they
wanted
that
is
all
the
states
where
slavery
existed
they
did
not
seem
to
think
this
course
inconsistent
the
fact
is
the
southern
believed
that
in
some
way
the
ownership
of
slaves
conferred
a
sort
of
patent
of
nobility
a
right
to
govern
independent
of
the
interest
or
wishes
of
those
who
did
not
hold
such
property
they
convinced
themselves
first
of
the
divine
origin
of
the
institution
and
next
that
that
particular
institution
was
not
safe
in
the
hands
of
any
body
of
legislators
but
themselves
meanwhile
the
administration
of
president
buchanan
looked
helplessly
on
and
proclaimed
that
the
general
government
had
no
power
to
interfere
that
the
nation
had
no
power
to
save
its
own
life
buchanan
had
in
his
cabinet
two
members
at
least
who
were
as
earnest
to
use
a
mild
term
in
the
cause
of
secession
as
davis
or
any
southern
statesman
one
of
them
floyd
the
secretary
of
war
scattered
the
army
so
that
much
of
it
could
be
captured
when
hostilities
should
commence
and
distributed
the
cannon
and
small
arms
from
northern
arsenals
throughout
the
south
so
as
to
be
on
hand
when
treason
wanted
them
the
navy
was
scattered
in
like
manner
the
president
did
not
prevent
his
cabinet
preparing
for
war
upon
their
government
either
by
destroying
its
resources
or
storing
them
in
the
south
until
a
de
facto
government
was
established
with
jefferson
davis
as
its
president
and
montgomery
alabama
as
the
capital
the
secessionists
had
then
to
leave
the
cabinet
in
their
own
estimation
they
were
aliens
in
the
country
which
had
given
them
birth
loyal
men
were
put
into
their
places
treason
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
was
estopped
but
the
harm
had
already
been
done
the
stable
door
was
locked
after
the
horse
had
been
stolen
during
all
of
the
trying
winter
of
when
the
southerners
were
so
defiant
that
they
would
not
allow
within
their
borders
the
expression
of
a
sentiment
hostile
to
their
views
it
was
a
brave
man
indeed
who
could
stand
up
and
proclaim
his
loyalty
to
the
union
on
the
other
hand
men
at
the
north
prominent
men
proclaimed
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
coerce
the
south
into
submission
to
the
laws
of
the
land
that
if
the
north
undertook
to
raise
armies
to
go
south
these
armies
would
have
to
march
over
the
dead
bodies
of
the
speakers
a
portion
of
the
press
of
the
north
was
constantly
proclaiming
similar
views
when
the
time
arrived
for
the
to
go
to
the
capital
of
the
nation
to
be
sworn
into
office
it
was
deemed
unsafe
for
him
to
travel
not
only
as
a
but
as
any
private
citizen
should
be
allowed
to
do
instead
of
going
in
a
special
car
receiving
the
good
wishes
of
his
constituents
at
all
the
stations
along
the
road
he
was
obliged
to
stop
on
the
way
and
to
be
smuggled
into
the
capital
he
disappeared
from
public
view
on
his
journey
and
the
next
the
country
knew
his
arrival
was
announced
at
the
capital
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
assassinated
if
he
had
attempted
to
travel
openly
throughout
his
journey

of
april

a
national
fort
in

south

was
fired

by

and
a

days
after

confederates
proclaimed

and
thereby
debarred
themselves
of
all

of

we
did
not
admit
the

the

they
debarred
themselves
of

president

issued
his

call
for
troops
and
soon
after
a
proclamation
convening
congress
in
extra
session
the
call
was
for
volunteers
for
ninety
days
service
if
the
shot
fired
at
fort
sumter
was
heard
around
the
world
the
call
of
the
president
for
men
was
heard
throughout
the
northern
states
there
was
not
a
state
in
the
north
of
a
million
of
inhabitants
that
would
not
have
furnished
the
entire
number
faster
than
arms
could
have
been
supplied
to
them
if
it
had
been
necessary
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
call
for
volunteers
reached
galena
posters
were
stuck
up
calling
for
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
at
the
in
the
evening
business
ceased
entirely
all
was
excitement
for
a
time
there
were
no
party
distinctions
all
were
union
men
determined
to
avenge
the
insult
to
the
national
flag
in
the
evening
the
was
packed
although
a
comparative
stranger
i
was
called
upon
to
preside
the
sole
reason
possibly
was
that
i
had
been
in
the
army
and
had
seen
service
with
much
embarrassment
and
some
prompting
i
made
out
to
announce
the
object
of
the
meeting
speeches
were
in
order
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
would
have
been
safe
just
then
to
make
other
than
patriotic
ones
there
was
probably
no
one
in
the
house
however
who
felt
like
making
any
other
the
two
principal
speeches
were
by
b
howard
the
and
a
breckinridge
democrat
at
the
november
election
the
fall
before
and
john
rawlins
an
elector
on
the
douglas
ticket
washburne
with
whom
i
was
not
acquainted
at
that
time
came
in
after
the
meeting
had
been
organized
and
expressed
i
understood
afterwards
a
little
surprise
that
galena
could
not
furnish
a
presiding
officer
for
such
an
occasion
without
taking
a
stranger
he
came
forward
and
was
introduced
and
made
a
speech
appealing
to
the
patriotism
of
the
meeting
after
the
speaking
was
over
volunteers
were
called
for
to
form
a
company
the
quota
of
illinois
had
been
fixed
at
six
regiments
and
it
was
supposed
that
one
company
would
be
as
much
as
would
be
accepted
from
galena
the
company
was
raised
and
the
officers
and
officers
elected
before
the
meeting
adjourned
i
declined
the
captaincy
before
the
balloting
but
announced
that
i
would
aid
the
company
in
every
way
i
could
and
would
be
found
in
the
service
in
some
position
if
there
should
be
a
war
i
never
went
into
our
leather
store
after
that
meeting
to
put
up
a
package
or
do
other
business
the
ladies
of
galena
were
quite
as
patriotic
as
the
men
they
could
not
enlist
but
they
conceived
the
idea
of
sending
their
first
company
to
the
field
uniformed
they
came
to
me
to
get
a
description
of
the
united
states
uniform
for
infantry
subscribed
and
bought
the
material
procured
tailors
to
cut
out
the
garments
and
the
ladies
made
them
up
in
a
few
days
the
company
was
in
uniform
and
ready
to
report
at
the
state
capital
for
assignment
the
men
all
turned
out
the
morning
after
their
enlistment
and
i
took
charge
divided
them
into
squads
and
superintended
their
drill
when
they
were
ready
to
go
to
springfield
i
went
with
them
and
remained
there
until
they
were
assigned
to
a
regiment
there
were
so
many
more
volunteers
than
had
been
called
for
that
the
question
whom
to
accept
was
quite
embarrassing
to
the
governor
richard
yates
the
legislature
was
in
session
at
the
time
however
and
came
to
his
relief
a
law
was
enacted
authorizing
the
governor
to
accept
the
services
of
ten
additional
regiments
one
from
each
congressional
district
for
one
month
to
be
paid
by
the
state
but
pledged
to
go
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
if
there
should
be
a
further
call
during
their
term
even
with
this
relief
the
governor
was
still
very
much
embarrassed
before
the
war
was
over
he
was
like
the
president
when
he
was
taken
with
the
varioloid
at
last
he
had
something
he
could
give
to
all
who
wanted
it
in
time
the
galena
company
was
mustered
into
the
united
states
service
forming
a
part
of
the
illinois
volunteer
infantry
my
duties
i
thought
had
ended
at
springfield
and
i
was
prepared
to
start
home
by
the
evening
train
leaving
at
nine
up
to
that
time
i
do
not
think
i
had
been
introduced
to
governor
yates
or
had
ever
spoken
to
him
i
knew
him
by
sight
however
because
he
was
living
at
the
same
hotel
and
i
often
saw
him
at
table
the
evening
i
was
to
quit
the
capital
i
left
the
supper
room
before
the
governor
and
was
standing
at
the
front
door
when
he
came
out
he
spoke
to
me
calling
me
by
my
old
army
title
captain
and
said
he
understood
that
i
was
about
leaving
the
city
i
answered
that
i
was
he
said
he
would
be
glad
if
i
would
remain
and
call
at
the
executive
office
the
next
morning
i
complied
with
his
request
and
was
asked
to
go
into
the
office
and
render
such
assistance
as
i
could
the
governor
saying
that
my
army
experience
would
be
of
great
service
there
i
accepted
the
proposition
my
old
army
experience
i
found
indeed
of
very
great
service
i
was
no
clerk
nor
had
i
any
capacity
to
become
one
the
only
place
i
ever
found
in
my
life
to
put
a
paper
so
as
to
find
it
again
was
either
a
side
or
the
hands
of
a
clerk
or
secretary
more
careful
than
myself
but
i
had
been
quartermaster
commissary
and
adjutant
in
the
field
the
army
forms
were
familiar
to
me
and
i
could
direct
how
they
should
be
made
out
there
was
a
clerk
in
the
office
of
the
who
supplied
my
deficiencies
the
ease
with
which
the
state
of
illinois
settled
its
accounts
with
the
government
at
the
close
of
the
war
is
evidence
of
the
efficiency
of
loomis
as
an
accountant
on
a
large
scale
he
remained
in
the
office
until
that
time
as
i
have
stated
the
legislature
authorized
the
governor
to
accept
the
services
of
ten
additional
regiments
i
had
charge
of
mustering
these
regiments
into
the
state
service
they
were
assembled
at
the
most
convenient
railroad
centres
in
their
respective
congressional
districts
i
detailed
officers
to
muster
in
a
portion
of
them
but
mustered
three
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
myself
one
of
these
was
to
assemble
at
belleville
some
eighteen
miles
of
louis
when
i
got
there
i
found
that
only
one
or
two
companies
had
arrived
there
was
no
probability
of
the
regiment
coming
together
under
five
days
this
gave
me
a
few
idle
days
which
i
concluded
to
spend
in
louis
there
was
a
considerable
force
of
state
militia
at
camp
jackson
on
the
outskirts
of
louis
at
the
time
there
is
but
little
doubt
that
it
was
the
design
of
governor
claiborn
jackson
to
have
these
troops
ready
to
seize
the
united
states
arsenal
and
the
city
of
louis
why
they
did
not
do
so
i
do
not
know
there
was
but
a
small
garrison
two
companies
i
think
under
captain
lyon
at
the
arsenal
and
but
for
the
timely
services
of
the
hon
blair
i
have
little
doubt
that
louis
would
have
gone
into
rebel
hands
and
with
it
the
arsenal
with
all
its
arms
and
ammunition
blair
was
a
leader
among
the
union
men
of
louis
in
there
was
no
state
government
in
missouri
at
the
time
that
would
sanction
the
raising
of
troops
or
commissioned
officers
to
protect
united
states
property
but
blair
had
probably
procured
some
form
of
authority
from
the
president
to
raise
troops
in
missouri
and
to
muster
them
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
at
all
events
he
did
raise
a
regiment
and
took
command
himself
as
colonel
with
this
force
he
reported
to
captain
lyon
and
placed
himself
and
regiment
under
his
orders
it
was
whispered
that
lyon
thus
reinforced
intended
to
break
up
camp
jackson
and
capture
the
militia
i
went
down
to
the
arsenal
in
the
morning
to
see
the
troops
start
out
i
had
known
lyon
for
two
years
at
west
point
and
in
the
old
army
afterwards
blair
i
knew
very
well
by
sight
i
had
heard
him
speak
in
the
canvass
of
possibly
several
times
but
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
as
the
troops
marched
out
of
the
enclosure
around
the
arsenal
blair
was
on
his
horse
outside
forming
them
into
line
preparatory
to
their
march
i
introduced
myself
to
him
and
had
a
few
moments
conversation
and
expressed
my
sympathy
with
his
purpose
this
was
my
first
personal
acquaintance
with
the
honorable
afterwards
blair
camp
jackson
surrendered
without
a
fight
and
the
garrison
was
marched
down
to
the
arsenal
as
prisoners
of
war
up
to
this
time
the
enemies
of
the
government
in
louis
had
been
bold
and
defiant
while
union
men
were
quiet
but
determined
the
enemies
had
their
in
a
central
and
public
position
on
pine
street
near
fifth
from
which
the
rebel
flag
was
flaunted
boldly
the
union
men
had
a
place
of
meeting
somewhere
in
the
city
i
did
not
know
where
and
i
doubt
whether
they
dared
to
enrage
the
enemies
of
the
government
by
placing
the
national
flag
outside
their
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
capture
of
camp
jackson
reached
the
city
the
condition
of
affairs
was
changed
union
men
became
rampant
aggressive
and
if
you
will
intolerant
they
proclaimed
their
sentiments
boldly
and
were
impatient
at
anything
like
disrespect
for
the
union
the
secessionists
became
quiet
but
were
filled
with
suppressed
rage
they
had
been
playing
the
bully
the
union
men
ordered
the
rebel
flag
taken
down
from
the
building
on
pine
street
the
command
was
given
in
tones
of
authority
and
it
was
taken
down
never
to
be
raised
again
in
louis
i
witnessed
the
scene
i
had
heard
of
the
surrender
of
the
camp
and
that
the
garrison
was
on
its
way
to
the
arsenal
i
had
seen
the
troops
start
out
in
the
morning
and
had
wished
them
success
i
now
determined
to
go
to
the
arsenal
and
await
their
arrival
and
congratulate
them
i
stepped
on
a
car
standing
at
the
corner
of
and
pine
streets
and
saw
a
crowd
of
people
standing
quietly
in
front
of
the
who
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
hauling
down
the
flag
there
were
squads
of
other
people
at
intervals
down
the
street
they
too
were
quiet
but
filled
with
suppressed
rage
and
muttered
their
resentment
at
the
insult
to
what
they
called
their
flag
before
the
car
i
was
in
had
started
a
dapper
little
fellow
he
would
be
called
a
dude
at
this
day
stepped
in
he
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
and
used
adjectives
freely
to
express
his
contempt
for
the
union
and
for
those
who
had
just
perpetrated
such
an
outrage
upon
the
rights
of
a
free
people
there
was
only
one
other
passenger
in
the
car
besides
myself
when
this
young
man
entered
he
evidently
expected
to
find
nothing
but
sympathy
when
he
got
away
from
the
mud
sills
engaged
in
compelling
a
free
people
to
pull
down
a
flag
they
adored
he
turned
to
me
saying
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
a
free
people
ca
choose
their
own
flag
where
i
came
from
if
a
man
dares
to
say
a
word
in
favor
of
the
union
we
hang
him
to
a
limb
of
the
first
tree
we
come
to
i
replied
that
after
all
we
were
not
so
intolerant
in
louis
as
we
might
be
i
had
not
seen
a
single
rebel
hung
yet
nor
heard
of
one
there
were
plenty
of
them
who
ought
to
be
however
the
young
man
subsided
he
was
so
crestfallen
that
i
believe
if
i
had
ordered
him
to
leave
the
car
he
would
have
gone
quietly
out
saying
to
himself
more
yankee
oppression
by
nightfall
the
late
defenders
of
camp
jackson
were
all
within
the
walls
of
the
louis
arsenal
prisoners
of
war
the
next
day
i
left
louis
for
mattoon
illinois
where
i
was
to
muster
in
the
regiment
from
that
congressional
district
this
was
the
illinois
infantry
the
regiment
of
which
i
subsequently
became
colonel
i
mustered
one
regiment
afterwards
when
my
services
for
the
state
were
about
closed
john
pope
was
stationed
at
springfield
as
united
states
mustering
officer
all
the
time
i
was
in
the
state
service
he
was
a
native
of
illinois
and
well
acquainted
with
most
of
the
prominent
men
in
the
state
i
was
a
and
knew
but
few
of
them
while
i
was
on
duty
at
springfield
the
senators
representatives
in
congress
and
the
state
legislators
were
nearly
all
at
the
state
capital
the
only
acquaintance
i
made
among
them
was
with
the
governor
whom
i
was
serving
and
by
chance
with
senator
douglas
the
only
members
of
congress
i
knew
were
washburne
and
philip
foulk
with
the
former
though
he
represented
my
district
and
we
were
citizens
of
the
same
town
i
only
became
acquainted
at
the
meeting
when
the
first
company
of
galena
volunteers
was
raised
foulk
i
had
known
in
louis
when
i
was
a
citizen
of
that
city
i
had
been
three
years
at
west
point
with
pope
and
had
served
with
him
a
short
time
during
the
mexican
war
under
general
taylor
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
during
my
service
with
the
state
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
me
that
i
ought
to
go
into
the
united
states
service
i
told
him
i
intended
to
do
so
if
there
was
a
war
he
spoke
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
public
men
of
the
state
and
said
he
could
get
them
to
recommend
me
for
a
position
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
for
me
i
declined
to
receive
endorsement
for
permission
to
fight
for
my
country
going
home
for
a
day
or
two
soon
after
this
conversation
with
general
pope
i
wrote
from
galena
the
following
letter
to
the
of
the
army
galena
illinois
may
thomas
adjt
washington
sir
having
served
for
fifteen
years
in
the
regular
army
including
four
years
at
west
point
and
feeling
it
the
duty
of
every
one
who
has
been
educated
at
the
government
expense
to
offer
their
services
for
the
support
of
that
government
i
have
the
honor
very
respectfully
to
tender
my
services
until
the
close
of
the
war
in
such
capacity
as
may
be
offered
i
would
say
in
view
of
my
present
age
and
length
of
service
i
feel
myself
competent
to
command
a
regiment
if
the
president
in
his
judgment
should
see
fit
to
intrust
one
to
me
since
the
first
call
of
the
president
i
have
been
serving
on
the
staff
of
the
governor
of
this
state
rendering
such
aid
as
i
could
in
the
organization
of
our
state
militia
and
am
still
engaged
in
that
capacity
a
letter
addressed
to
me
at
springfield
illinois
will
reach
me
i
am
very
respectfully
your
obt
grant
this
letter
failed
to
elicit
an
answer
from
the
of
the
army
i
presume
it
was
hardly
read
by
him
and
certainly
it
could
not
have
been
submitted
to
higher
authority
subsequent
to
the
war
general
badeau
having
heard
of
this
letter
applied
to
the
war
department
for
a
copy
of
it
the
letter
could
not
be
found
and
no
one
recollected
ever
having
seen
it
i
took
no
copy
when
it
was
written
long
after
the
application
of
general
badeau
general
townsend
who
had
become
of
the
army
while
packing
up
papers
preparatory
to
the
removal
of
his
office
found
this
letter
in
some
place
it
had
not
been
destroyed
but
it
had
not
been
regularly
filed
away
i
felt
some
hesitation
in
suggesting
rank
as
high
as
the
colonelcy
of
a
regiment
feeling
somewhat
doubtful
whether
i
would
be
equal
to
the
position
but
i
had
seen
nearly
every
colonel
who
had
been
mustered
in
from
the
state
of
illinois
and
some
from
indiana
and
felt
that
if
they
could
command
a
regiment
properly
and
with
credit
i
could
also
having
but
little
to
do
after
the
muster
of
the
last
of
the
regiments
authorized
by
the
state
legislature
i
asked
and
obtained
of
the
governor
leave
of
absence
for
a
week
to
visit
my
parents
in
covington
kentucky
immediately
opposite
cincinnati
general
mcclellan
had
been
made
a
and
had
his
headquarters
at
cincinnati
in
reality
i
wanted
to
see
him
i
had
known
him
slightly
at
west
point
where
we
served
one
year
together
and
in
the
mexican
war
i
was
in
hopes
that
when
he
saw
me
he
would
offer
me
a
position
on
his
staff
i
called
on
two
successive
days
at
his
office
but
failed
to
see
him
on
either
occasion
and
returned
to
springfield
chapter
xviii
appointed
colonel
of
the
illinois
personnel
of
the
regiment
general
logan
march
to
missouri
movement
against
harris
at
florida
general
pope
in
command
stationed
at
mexico
mo
while
i
was
absent
from
the
state
capital
on
this
occasion
the
president
second
call
for
troops
was
issued
this
time
it
was
for
men
for
three
years
or
the
war
this
brought
into
the
united
states
service
all
the
regiments
then
in
the
state
service
these
had
elected
their
officers
from
highest
to
lowest
and
were
accepted
with
their
organizations
as
they
were
except
in
two
instances
a
chicago
regiment
the
infantry
had
elected
a
very
young
man
to
the
colonelcy
when
it
came
to
taking
the
field
the
regiment
asked
to
have
another
appointed
colonel
and
the
one
they
had
previously
chosen
made
the
regiment
of
infantry
mustered
in
by
me
at
mattoon
refused
to
go
into
the
service
with
the
colonel
of
their
selection
in
any
position
while
i
was
still
absent
governor
yates
appointed
me
colonel
of
this
latter
regiment
a
few
days
after
i
was
in
charge
of
it
and
in
camp
on
the
fair
grounds
near
springfield
my
regiment
was
composed
in
large
part
of
young
men
of
as
good
social
position
as
any
in
their
section
of
the
state
it
embraced
the
sons
of
farmers
lawyers
physicians
politicians
merchants
bankers
and
ministers
and
some
men
of
maturer
years
who
had
filled
such
positions
themselves
there
were
also
men
in
it
who
could
be
led
astray
and
the
colonel
elected
by
the
votes
of
the
regiment
had
proved
to
be
fully
capable
of
developing
all
there
was
in
his
men
of
recklessness
it
was
said
that
he
even
went
so
far
at
times
as
to
take
the
guard
from
their
posts
and
go
with
them
to
the
village
near
by
and
make
a
night
of
it
when
there
came
a
prospect
of
battle
the
regiment
wanted
to
have
some
one
else
to
lead
them
i
found
it
very
hard
work
for
a
few
days
to
bring
all
the
men
into
anything
like
subordination
but
the
great
majority
favored
discipline
and
by
the
application
of
a
little
regular
army
punishment
all
were
reduced
to
as
good
discipline
as
one
could
ask
the
ten
regiments
which
had
volunteered
in
the
state
service
for
thirty
days
it
will
be
remembered
had
done
so
with
a
pledge
to
go
into
the
national
service
if
called
upon
within
that
time
when
they
volunteered
the
government
had
only
called
for
ninety
days
enlistments
men
were
called
now
for
three
years
or
the
war
they
felt
that
this
change
of
period
released
them
from
the
obligation
of
when
i
was
appointed
colonel
the
regiment
was
still
in
the
state
service
about
the
time
they
were
to
be
mustered
into
the
united
states
service
such
of
them
as
would
go
two
members
of
congress
from
the
state
mcclernand
and
logan
appeared
at
the
capital
and
i
was
introduced
to
them
i
had
never
seen
either
of
them
before
but
i
had
read
a
great
deal
about
them
and
particularly
about
logan
in
the
newspapers
both
were
democratic
members
of
congress
and
logan
had
been
elected
from
the
southern
district
of
the
state
where
he
had
a
majority
of
eighteen
thousand
over
his
republican
competitor
his
district
had
been
settled
originally
by
people
from
the
southern
states
and
at
the
breaking
out
of
secession
they
sympathized
with
the
south
at
the
first
outbreak
of
war
some
of
them
joined
the
southern
army
many
others
were
preparing
to
do
so
others
rode
over
the
country
at
night
denouncing
the
union
and
made
it
as
necessary
to
guard
railroad
bridges
over
which
national
troops
had
to
pass
in
southern
illinois
as
it
was
in
kentucky
or
any
of
the
border
slave
states
logan
popularity
in
this
district
was
unbounded
he
knew
almost
enough
of
the
people
in
it
by
their
christian
names
to
form
an
ordinary
congressional
district
as
he
went
in
politics
so
his
district
was
sure
to
go
the
republican
papers
had
been
demanding
that
he
should
announce
where
he
stood
on
the
questions
which
at
that
time
engrossed
the
whole
of
public
thought
some
were
very
bitter
in
their
denunciations
of
his
silence
logan
was
not
a
man
to
be
coerced
into
an
utterance
by
threats
he
did
however
come
out
in
a
speech
before
the
adjournment
of
the
special
session
of
congress
which
was
convened
by
the
president
soon
after
his
inauguration
and
announced
his
undying
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
union
but
i
had
not
happened
to
see
that
speech
so
that
when
i
first
met
logan
my
impressions
were
those
formed
from
reading
denunciations
of
him
mcclernand
on
the
other
hand
had
early
taken
strong
grounds
for
the
maintenance
of
the
union
and
had
been
praised
accordingly
by
the
republican
papers
the
gentlemen
who
presented
these
two
members
of
congress
asked
me
if
i
would
have
any
objections
to
their
addressing
my
regiment
i
hesitated
a
little
before
answering
it
was
but
a
few
days
before
the
time
set
for
mustering
into
the
united
states
service
such
of
the
men
as
were
willing
to
volunteer
for
three
years
or
the
war
i
had
some
doubt
as
to
the
effect
a
speech
from
logan
might
have
but
as
he
was
with
mcclernand
whose
sentiments
on
the
questions
of
the
day
were
well
known
i
gave
my
consent
mcclernand
spoke
first
and
logan
followed
in
a
speech
which
he
has
hardly
equalled
since
for
force
and
eloquence
it
breathed
a
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
union
which
inspired
my
men
to
such
a
point
that
they
would
have
volunteered
to
remain
in
the
army
as
long
as
an
enemy
of
the
country
continued
to
bear
arms
against
it
they
entered
the
united
states
service
almost
to
a
man
general
logan
went
to
his
part
of
the
state
and
gave
his
attention
to
raising
troops
the
very
men
who
at
first
made
it
necessary
to
guard
the
roads
in
southern
illinois
became
the
defenders
of
the
union
logan
entered
the
service
himself
as
colonel
of
a
regiment
and
rapidly
rose
to
the
rank
of
his
district
which
had
promised
at
first
to
give
much
trouble
to
the
government
filled
every
call
made
upon
it
for
troops
without
resorting
to
the
draft
there
was
no
call
made
when
there
were
not
more
volunteers
than
were
asked
for
that
congressional
district
stands
credited
at
the
war
department
with
furnishing
more
men
for
the
army
than
it
was
called
on
to
supply
i
remained
in
springfield
with
my
regiment
until
the
of
july
when
i
was
ordered
to
quincy
illinois
by
that
time
the
regiment
was
in
a
good
state
of
discipline
and
the
officers
and
men
were
well
up
in
the
company
drill
there
was
direct
railroad
communication
between
springfield
and
quincy
but
i
thought
it
would
be
good
preparation
for
the
troops
to
march
there
we
had
no
transportation
for
our
camp
and
garrison
equipage
so
wagons
were
hired
for
the
occasion
and
on
the
of
july
we
started
there
was
no
hurry
but
fair
marches
were
made
every
day
until
the
illinois
river
was
crossed
there
i
was
overtaken
by
a
dispatch
saying
that
the
destination
of
the
regiment
had
been
changed
to
ironton
missouri
and
ordering
me
to
halt
where
i
was
and
await
the
arrival
of
a
steamer
which
had
been
dispatched
up
the
illinois
river
to
take
the
regiment
to
louis
the
boat
when
it
did
come
grounded
on
a
a
few
miles
below
where
we
were
in
camp
we
remained
there
several
days
waiting
to
have
the
boat
get
off
the
bar
but
before
this
occurred
news
came
that
an
illinois
regiment
was
surrounded
by
rebels
at
a
point
on
the
hannibal
and
joe
railroad
some
miles
west
of
palmyra
in
missouri
and
i
was
ordered
to
proceed
with
all
dispatch
to
their
relief
we
took
the
cars
and
reached
quincy
in
a
few
hours
when
i
left
galena
for
the
last
time
to
take
command
of
the
regiment
i
took
with
me
my
oldest
son
frederick
grant
then
a
lad
of
eleven
years
of
age
on
receiving
the
order
to
take
rail
for
quincy
i
wrote
to
grant
to
relieve
what
i
supposed
would
be
her
great
anxiety
for
one
so
young
going
into
danger
that
i
would
send
fred
home
from
quincy
by
river
i
received
a
prompt
letter
in
reply
decidedly
disapproving
my
proposition
and
urging
that
the
lad
should
be
allowed
to
accompany
me
it
came
too
late
fred
was
already
on
his
way
up
the
mississippi
bound
for
dubuque
iowa
from
which
place
there
was
a
railroad
to
galena
my
sensations
as
we
approached
what
i
supposed
might
be
a
field
of
battle
were
anything
but
agreeable
i
had
been
in
all
the
engagements
in
mexico
that
it
was
possible
for
one
person
to
be
in
but
not
in
command
if
some
one
else
had
been
colonel
and
i
had
been
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
felt
any
trepidation
before
we
were
prepared
to
cross
the
mississippi
river
at
quincy
my
anxiety
was
relieved
for
the
men
of
the
besieged
regiment
came
straggling
into
town
i
am
inclined
to
think
both
sides
got
frightened
and
ran
away
i
took
my
regiment
to
palmyra
and
remained
there
for
a
few
days
until
relieved
by
the
illinois
infantry
from
palmyra
i
proceeded
to
salt
river
the
railroad
bridge
over
which
had
been
destroyed
by
the
enemy
colonel
john
palmer
at
that
time
commanded
the
illinois
which
was
acting
as
a
guard
to
workmen
who
were
engaged
in
rebuilding
this
bridge
palmer
was
my
senior
and
commanded
the
two
regiments
as
long
as
we
remained
together
the
bridge
was
finished
in
about
two
weeks
and
i
received
orders
to
move
against
colonel
thomas
harris
who
was
said
to
be
encamped
at
the
little
town
of
florida
some
miles
south
of
where
we
then
were
at
the
time
of
which
i
now
write
we
had
no
transportation
and
the
country
about
salt
river
was
sparsely
settled
so
that
it
took
some
days
to
collect
teams
and
drivers
enough
to
move
the
camp
and
garrison
equipage
of
a
regiment
nearly
a
thousand
strong
together
with
a
supply
of
provision
and
some
ammunition
while
preparations
for
the
move
were
going
on
i
felt
quite
comfortable
but
when
we
got
on
the
road
and
found
every
house
deserted
i
was
anything
but
easy
in
the
miles
we
had
to
march
we
did
not
see
a
person
old
or
young
male
or
female
except
two
horsemen
who
were
on
a
road
that
crossed
ours
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
they
decamped
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
i
kept
my
men
in
the
ranks
and
forbade
their
entering
any
of
the
deserted
houses
or
taking
anything
from
them
we
halted
at
night
on
the
road
and
proceeded
the
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
harris
had
been
encamped
in
a
creek
bottom
for
the
sake
of
being
near
water
the
hills
on
either
side
of
the
creek
extend
to
a
considerable
height
possibly
more
than
a
hundred
feet
as
we
approached
the
brow
of
the
hill
from
which
it
was
expected
we
could
see
harris
camp
and
possibly
find
his
men
ready
formed
to
meet
us
my
heart
kept
getting
higher
and
higher
until
it
felt
to
me
as
though
it
was
in
my
throat
i
would
have
given
anything
then
to
have
been
back
in
illinois
but
i
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
halt
and
consider
what
to
do
i
kept
right
on
when
we
reached
a
point
from
which
the
valley
below
was
in
full
view
i
halted
the
place
where
harris
had
been
encamped
a
few
days
before
was
still
there
and
the
marks
of
a
recent
encampment
were
plainly
visible
but
the
troops
were
gone
my
heart
resumed
its
place
it
occurred
to
me
at
once
that
harris
had
been
as
much
afraid
of
me
as
i
had
been
of
him
this
was
a
view
of
the
question
i
had
never
taken
before
but
it
was
one
i
never
forgot
afterwards
from
that
event
to
the
close
of
the
war
i
never
experienced
trepidation
upon
confronting
an
enemy
though
i
always
felt
more
or
less
anxiety
i
never
forgot
that
he
had
as
much
reason
to
fear
my
forces
as
i
had
his
the
lesson
was
valuable
inquiries
at
the
village
of
florida
divulged
the
fact
that
colonel
harris
learning
of
my
intended
movement
while
my
transportation
was
being
collected
took
time
by
the
forelock
and
left
florida
before
i
had
started
from
salt
river
he
had
increased
the
distance
between
us
by
forty
miles
the
next
day
i
started
back
to
my
old
camp
at
salt
river
bridge
the
citizens
living
on
the
line
of
our
march
had
returned
to
their
houses
after
we
passed
and
finding
everything
in
good
order
nothing
carried
away
they
were
at
their
front
doors
ready
to
greet
us
now
they
had
evidently
been
led
to
believe
that
the
national
troops
carried
death
and
devastation
with
them
wherever
they
went
in
a
short
time
after
our
return
to
salt
river
bridge
i
was
ordered
with
my
regiment
to
the
town
of
mexico
general
pope
was
then
commanding
the
district
embracing
all
of
the
state
of
missouri
between
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
with
his
headquarters
in
the
village
of
mexico
i
was
assigned
to
the
command
of
a
embracing
the
troops
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
some
three
regiments
of
infantry
and
a
section
of
artillery
there
was
one
regiment
encamped
by
the
side
of
mine
i
assumed
command
of
the
whole
and
the
first
night
sent
the
commander
of
the
other
regiment
the
parole
and
countersign
not
wishing
to
be
outdone
in
courtesy
he
immediately
sent
me
the
countersign
for
his
regiment
for
the
night
when
he
was
informed
that
the
countersign
sent
to
him
was
for
use
with
his
regiment
as
well
as
mine
it
was
difficult
to
make
him
understand
that
this
was
not
an
unwarranted
interference
of
one
colonel
over
another
no
doubt
he
attributed
it
for
the
time
to
the
presumption
of
a
graduate
of
west
point
over
a
volunteer
pure
and
simple
but
the
question
was
soon
settled
and
we
had
no
further
trouble
my
arrival
in
mexico
had
been
preceded
by
that
of
two
or
three
regiments
in
which
proper
discipline
had
not
been
maintained
and
the
men
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
houses
without
invitation
and
helping
themselves
to
food
and
drink
or
demanding
them
from
the
occupants
they
carried
their
muskets
while
out
of
camp
and
made
every
man
they
found
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
government
i
at
once
published
orders
prohibiting
the
soldiers
from
going
into
private
houses
unless
invited
by
the
inhabitants
and
from
appropriating
private
property
to
their
own
or
to
government
uses
the
people
were
no
longer
molested
or
made
afraid
i
received
the
most
marked
courtesy
from
the
citizens
of
mexico
as
long
as
i
remained
there
up
to
this
time
my
regiment
had
not
been
carried
in
the
school
of
the
soldier
beyond
the
company
drill
except
that
it
had
received
some
training
on
the
march
from
springfield
to
the
illinois
river
there
was
now
a
good
opportunity
of
exercising
it
in
the
battalion
drill
while
i
was
at
west
point
the
tactics
used
in
the
army
had
been
scott
and
the
musket
the
flint
lock
i
had
never
looked
at
a
copy
of
tactics
from
the
time
of
my
graduation
my
standing
in
that
branch
of
studies
had
been
near
the
foot
of
the
class
in
the
mexican
war
in
the
summer
of
i
had
been
appointed
regimental
quartermaster
and
commissary
and
had
not
been
at
a
battalion
drill
since
the
arms
had
been
changed
since
then
and
hardee
tactics
had
been
adopted
i
got
a
copy
of
tactics
and
studied
one
lesson
intending
to
confine
the
exercise
of
the
first
day
to
the
commands
i
had
thus
learned
by
pursuing
this
course
from
day
to
day
i
thought
i
would
soon
get
through
the
volume
we
were
encamped
just
outside
of
town
on
the
common
among
scattering
suburban
houses
with
enclosed
gardens
and
when
i
got
my
regiment
in
line
and
rode
to
the
front
i
soon
saw
that
if
i
attempted
to
follow
the
lesson
i
had
studied
i
would
have
to
clear
away
some
of
the
houses
and
garden
fences
to
make
room
i
perceived
at
once
however
that
tactics
a
mere
translation
from
the
french
with
hardee
name
attached
was
nothing
more
than
common
sense
and
the
progress
of
the
age
applied
to
scott
system
the
commands
were
abbreviated
and
the
movement
expedited
under
the
old
tactics
almost
every
change
in
the
order
of
march
was
preceded
by
a
halt
then
came
the
change
and
then
the
forward
march
with
the
new
tactics
all
these
changes
could
be
made
while
in
motion
i
found
no
trouble
in
giving
commands
that
would
take
my
regiment
where
i
wanted
it
to
go
and
carry
it
around
all
obstacles
i
do
not
believe
that
the
officers
of
the
regiment
ever
discovered
that
i
had
never
studied
the
tactics
that
i
used
chapter
xix
commissioned
command
at
ironton
jefferson
city
cape
girardeau
general
prentiss
seizure
of
paducah
headquarters
at
cairo
i
had
not
been
in
mexico
many
weeks
when
reading
a
louis
paper
i
found
the
president
had
asked
the
illinois
delegation
in
congress
to
recommend
some
citizens
of
the
state
for
the
position
of
and
that
they
had
unanimously
recommended
me
as
first
on
a
list
of
seven
i
was
very
much
surprised
because
as
i
have
said
my
acquaintance
with
the
congressmen
was
very
limited
and
i
did
not
know
of
anything
i
had
done
to
inspire
such
confidence
the
papers
of
the
next
day
announced
that
my
name
with
three
others
had
been
sent
to
the
senate
and
a
few
days
after
our
confirmation
was
announced
when
appointed
i
at
once
thought
it
proper
that
one
of
my
aides
should
come
from
the
regiment
i
had
been
commanding
and
so
selected
lieutenant
lagow
while
living
in
louis
i
had
had
a
desk
in
the
law
office
of
mcclellan
moody
and
hillyer
difference
in
views
between
the
members
of
the
firm
on
the
questions
of
the
day
and
general
hard
times
in
the
border
cities
had
broken
up
this
firm
hillyer
was
quite
a
young
man
then
in
his
twenties
and
very
brilliant
i
asked
him
to
accept
a
place
on
my
staff
i
also
wanted
to
take
one
man
from
my
new
home
galena
the
canvass
in
the
presidential
campaign
the
fall
before
had
brought
out
a
young
lawyer
by
the
name
of
john
rawlins
who
proved
himself
one
of
the
ablest
speakers
in
the
state
he
was
also
a
candidate
for
elector
on
the
douglas
ticket
when
sumter
was
fired
upon
and
the
integrity
of
the
union
threatened
there
was
no
man
more
ready
to
serve
his
country
than
he
i
wrote
at
once
asking
him
to
accept
the
position
of
assistant
with
the
rank
of
captain
on
my
staff
he
was
about
entering
the
service
as
major
of
a
new
regiment
then
organizing
in
the
part
of
the
state
but
he
threw
this
up
and
accepted
my
offer
neither
hillyer
nor
lagow
proved
to
have
any
particular
taste
or
special
qualifications
for
the
duties
of
the
soldier
and
the
former
resigned
during
the
vicksburg
campaign
the
latter
i
relieved
after
the
battle
of
chattanooga
rawlins
remained
with
me
as
long
as
he
lived
and
rose
to
the
rank
of
brigadier
general
and
to
the
general
of
the
army
an
office
created
for
him
before
the
war
closed
he
was
an
able
man
possessed
of
great
firmness
and
could
say
no
so
emphatically
to
a
request
which
he
thought
should
not
be
granted
that
the
person
he
was
addressing
would
understand
at
once
that
there
was
no
use
of
pressing
the
matter
general
rawlins
was
a
very
useful
officer
in
other
ways
than
this
i
became
very
much
attached
to
him
shortly
after
my
promotion
i
was
ordered
to
ironton
missouri
to
command
a
district
in
that
part
of
the
state
and
took
the
illinois
my
old
regiment
with
me
several
other
regiments
were
ordered
to
the
same
destination
about
the
same
time
ironton
is
on
the
iron
mountain
railroad
about
seventy
miles
south
of
louis
and
situated
among
hills
rising
almost
to
the
dignity
of
mountains
when
i
reached
there
about
the
of
august
colonel
gratz
brown
afterwards
governor
of
missouri
and
in
candidate
was
in
command
some
of
his
troops
were
ninety
days
men
and
their
time
had
expired
some
time
before
the
men
had
no
clothing
but
what
they
had
volunteered
in
and
much
of
this
was
so
worn
that
it
would
hardly
stay
on
general
hardee
the
author
of
the
tactics
i
did
not
study
was
at
greenville
some
miles
further
south
it
was
said
with
five
thousand
confederate
troops
under
these
circumstances
colonel
brown
command
was
very
much
demoralized
a
squadron
of
cavalry
could
have
ridden
into
the
valley
and
captured
the
entire
force
brown
himself
was
gladder
to
see
me
on
that
occasion
than
he
ever
has
been
since
i
relieved
him
and
sent
all
his
men
home
within
a
day
or
two
to
be
mustered
out
of
service
within
ten
days
after
reading
ironton
i
was
prepared
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
enemy
at
greenville
i
sent
a
column
east
out
of
the
valley
we
were
in
with
orders
to
swing
around
to
the
south
and
west
and
come
into
the
greenville
road
ten
miles
south
of
ironton
another
column
marched
on
the
direct
road
and
went
into
camp
at
the
point
designated
for
the
two
columns
to
meet
i
was
to
ride
out
the
next
morning
and
take
personal
command
of
the
movement
my
experience
against
harris
in
northern
missouri
had
inspired
me
with
confidence
but
when
the
evening
train
came
in
it
brought
general
prentiss
with
orders
to
take
command
of
the
district
his
orders
did
not
relieve
me
but
i
knew
that
by
law
i
was
senior
and
at
that
time
even
the
president
did
not
have
the
authority
to
assign
a
junior
to
command
a
senior
of
the
same
grade
i
therefore
gave
general
prentiss
the
situation
of
the
troops
and
the
general
condition
of
affairs
and
started
for
louis
the
same
day
the
movement
against
the
rebels
at
greenville
went
no
further
from
louis
i
was
ordered
to
jefferson
city
the
capital
of
the
state
to
take
command
general
sterling
price
of
the
confederate
army
was
thought
to
be
threatening
the
capital
lexington
chillicothe
and
other
comparatively
large
towns
in
the
central
part
of
missouri
i
found
a
good
many
troops
in
jefferson
city
but
in
the
greatest
confusion
and
no
one
person
knew
where
they
all
were
colonel
mulligan
a
gallant
man
was
in
command
but
he
had
not
been
educated
as
yet
to
his
new
profession
and
did
not
know
how
to
maintain
discipline
i
found
that
volunteers
had
obtained
permission
from
the
department
commander
or
claimed
they
had
to
raise
some
of
them
regiments
some
battalions
some
companies
the
officers
to
be
commissioned
according
to
the
number
of
men
they
brought
into
the
service
there
were
recruiting
stations
all
over
town
with
notices
rudely
lettered
on
boards
over
the
doors
announcing
the
arm
of
service
and
length
of
time
for
which
recruits
at
that
station
would
be
received
the
law
required
all
volunteers
to
serve
for
three
years
or
the
war
but
in
jefferson
city
in
august
they
were
recruited
for
different
periods
and
on
different
conditions
some
were
enlisted
for
six
months
some
for
a
year
some
without
any
condition
as
to
where
they
were
to
serve
others
were
not
to
be
sent
out
of
the
state
the
recruits
were
principally
men
from
regiments
stationed
there
and
already
in
the
service
bound
for
three
years
if
the
war
lasted
that
long
the
city
was
filled
with
union
fugitives
who
had
been
driven
by
guerilla
bands
to
take
refuge
with
the
national
troops
they
were
in
a
deplorable
condition
and
must
have
starved
but
for
the
support
the
government
gave
them
they
had
generally
made
their
escape
with
a
team
or
two
sometimes
a
yoke
of
oxen
with
a
mule
or
a
horse
in
the
lead
a
little
bedding
besides
their
clothing
and
some
food
had
been
thrown
into
the
wagon
all
else
of
their
worldly
goods
were
abandoned
and
appropriated
by
their
former
neighbors
for
the
union
man
in
missouri
who
staid
at
home
during
the
rebellion
if
he
was
not
immediately
under
the
protection
of
the
national
troops
was
at
perpetual
war
with
his
neighbors
i
stopped
the
recruiting
service
and
disposed
the
troops
about
the
outskirts
of
the
city
so
as
to
guard
all
approaches
order
was
soon
restored
i
had
been
at
jefferson
city
but
a
few
days
when
i
was
directed
from
department
headquarters
to
fit
out
an
expedition
to
lexington
booneville
and
chillicothe
in
order
to
take
from
the
banks
in
those
cities
all
the
funds
they
had
and
send
them
to
louis
the
western
army
had
not
yet
been
supplied
with
transportation
it
became
necessary
therefore
to
press
into
the
service
teams
belonging
to
sympathizers
with
the
rebellion
or
to
hire
those
of
union
men
this
afforded
an
opportunity
of
giving
employment
to
such
of
the
refugees
within
our
lines
as
had
teams
suitable
for
our
purposes
they
accepted
the
service
with
alacrity
as
fast
as
troops
could
be
got
off
they
were
moved
west
some
twenty
miles
or
more
in
seven
or
eight
days
from
my
assuming
command
at
jefferson
city
i
had
all
the
troops
except
a
small
garrison
at
an
advanced
position
and
expected
to
join
them
myself
the
next
day
but
my
campaigns
had
not
yet
begun
for
while
seated
at
my
office
door
with
nothing
further
to
do
until
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
front
i
saw
an
officer
of
rank
approaching
who
proved
to
be
colonel
jefferson
davis
i
had
never
met
him
before
but
he
introduced
himself
by
handing
me
an
order
for
him
to
proceed
to
jefferson
city
and
relieve
me
of
the
command
the
orders
directed
that
i
should
report
at
department
headquarters
at
louis
without
delay
to
receive
important
special
instructions
it
was
about
an
hour
before
the
only
regular
train
of
the
day
would
start
i
therefore
turned
over
to
colonel
davis
my
orders
and
hurriedly
stated
to
him
the
progress
that
had
been
made
to
carry
out
the
department
instructions
already
described
i
had
at
that
time
but
one
staff
officer
doing
myself
all
the
detail
work
usually
performed
by
an
in
an
hour
after
being
relieved
from
the
command
i
was
on
my
way
to
louis
leaving
my
single
staff
officer
to
follow
the
next
day
with
our
horses
and
baggage
the
important
special
instructions
which
i
received
the
next
day
assigned
me
to
the
command
of
the
district
of
missouri
embracing
all
the
territory
south
of
louis
in
missouri
as
well
as
all
southern
illinois
at
first
i
was
to
take
personal
command
of
a
combined
expedition
that
had
been
ordered
for
the
capture
of
colonel
jeff
thompson
a
sort
of
independent
or
partisan
commander
who
was
disputing
with
us
the
possession
of
missouri
troops
had
been
ordered
to
move
from
ironton
to
cape
girardeau
sixty
or
seventy
miles
to
the
on
the
mississippi
river
while
the
forces
at
cape
girardeau
had
been
ordered
to
move
to
jacksonville
ten
miles
out
towards
ironton
and
troops
at
cairo
and
bird
point
at
the
junction
of
the
ohio
and
mississippi
rivers
were
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
go
down
the
mississippi
to
belmont
eighteen
miles
below
to
be
moved
west
from
there
when
an
officer
should
come
to
command
them
i
was
the
officer
who
had
been
selected
for
this
purpose
cairo
was
to
become
my
headquarters
when
the
expedition
terminated
in
pursuance
of
my
orders
i
established
my
temporary
headquarters
at
cape
girardeau
and
sent
instructions
to
the
commanding
officer
at
jackson
to
inform
me
of
the
approach
of
general
prentiss
from
ironton
hired
wagons
were
kept
moving
night
and
day
to
take
additional
rations
to
jackson
to
supply
the
troops
when
they
started
from
there
neither
general
prentiss
nor
colonel
marsh
who
commanded
at
jackson
knew
their
destination
i
drew
up
all
the
instructions
for
the
contemplated
move
and
kept
them
in
my
pocket
until
i
should
hear
of
the
junction
of
our
troops
at
jackson
two
or
three
days
after
my
arrival
at
cape
girardeau
word
came
that
general
prentiss
was
approaching
that
place
jackson
i
started
at
once
to
meet
him
there
and
to
give
him
his
orders
as
i
turned
the
first
corner
of
a
street
after
starting
i
saw
a
column
of
cavalry
passing
the
next
street
in
front
of
me
i
turned
and
rode
around
the
block
the
other
way
so
as
to
meet
the
head
of
the
column
i
found
there
general
prentiss
himself
with
a
large
escort
he
had
halted
his
troops
at
jackson
for
the
night
and
had
come
on
himself
to
cape
girardeau
leaving
orders
for
his
command
to
follow
him
in
the
morning
i
gave
the
general
his
orders
which
stopped
him
at
jackson
but
he
was
very
much
aggrieved
at
being
placed
under
another
particularly
as
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
senior
he
had
been
a
brigadier
in
command
at
cairo
while
i
was
mustering
officer
at
springfield
without
any
rank
but
we
were
nominated
at
the
same
time
for
the
united
states
service
and
both
our
commissions
bore
date
may
by
virtue
of
my
former
army
rank
i
was
by
law
the
senior
general
prentiss
failed
to
get
orders
to
his
troops
to
remain
at
jackson
and
the
next
morning
early
they
were
reported
as
approaching
cape
girardeau
i
then
ordered
the
general
very
peremptorily
to
countermarch
his
command
and
take
it
back
to
jackson
he
obeyed
the
order
but
bade
his
command
adieu
when
he
got
them
to
jackson
and
went
to
louis
and
reported
himself
this
broke
up
the
expedition
but
little
harm
was
done
as
jeff
thompson
moved
light
and
had
no
fixed
place
for
even
nominal
headquarters
he
was
as
much
at
home
in
arkansas
as
he
was
in
missouri
and
would
keep
out
of
the
way
of
a
superior
force
prentiss
was
sent
to
another
part
of
the
state
general
prentiss
made
a
great
mistake
on
the
above
occasion
one
that
he
would
not
have
committed
later
in
the
war
when
i
came
to
know
him
better
i
regretted
it
much
in
consequence
of
this
occurrence
he
was
off
duty
in
the
field
when
the
principal
campaign
at
the
west
was
going
on
and
his
juniors
received
promotion
while
he
was
where
none
could
be
obtained
he
would
have
been
next
to
myself
in
rank
in
the
district
of
missouri
by
virtue
of
his
services
in
the
mexican
war
he
was
a
brave
and
very
earnest
soldier
no
man
in
the
service
was
more
sincere
in
his
devotion
to
the
cause
for
which
we
were
battling
none
more
ready
to
make
sacrifices
or
risk
life
in
it
on
the
of
september
i
removed
my
headquarters
to
cairo
and
found
colonel
richard
oglesby
in
command
of
the
post
we
had
never
met
at
least
not
to
my
knowledge
after
my
promotion
i
had
ordered
my
uniform
from
new
york
but
it
had
not
yet
arrived
so
that
i
was
in
citizen
dress
the
colonel
had
his
office
full
of
people
mostly
from
the
neighboring
states
of
missouri
and
kentucky
making
complaints
or
asking
favors
he
evidently
did
not
catch
my
name
when
i
was
presented
for
on
my
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
table
where
he
was
seated
and
writing
the
order
assuming
command
of
the
district
of
missouri
colonel
richard
oglesby
to
command
the
post
at
bird
point
and
handing
it
to
him
he
put
on
an
expression
of
surprise
that
looked
a
little
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
some
one
identify
me
but
he
surrendered
the
office
without
question
the
day
after
i
assumed
command
at
cairo
a
man
came
to
me
who
said
he
was
a
scout
of
general
fremont
he
reported
that
he
had
just
come
from
columbus
a
point
on
the
mississippi
twenty
miles
below
on
the
kentucky
side
and
that
troops
had
started
from
there
or
were
about
to
start
to
seize
paducah
at
the
mouth
of
the
tennessee
there
was
no
time
for
delay
i
reported
by
telegraph
to
the
department
commander
the
information
i
had
received
and
added
that
i
was
taking
steps
to
get
off
that
night
to
be
in
advance
of
the
enemy
in
securing
that
important
point
there
was
a
large
number
of
steamers
lying
at
cairo
and
a
good
many
boatmen
were
staying
in
the
town
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
few
hours
to
get
the
boats
manned
with
coal
aboard
and
steam
up
troops
were
also
designated
to
go
aboard
the
distance
from
cairo
to
paducah
is
about
miles
i
did
not
wish
to
get
there
before
daylight
of
the
and
directed
therefore
that
the
boats
should
lie
at
anchor
out
in
the
stream
until
the
time
to
start
not
having
received
an
answer
to
my
first
dispatch
i
again
telegraphed
to
department
headquarters
that
i
should
start
for
paducah
that
night
unless
i
received
further
orders
hearing
nothing
we
started
before
midnight
and
arrived
early
the
following
morning
anticipating
the
enemy
by
probably
not
over
six
or
eight
hours
it
proved
very
fortunate
that
the
expedition
against
jeff
thompson
had
been
broken
up
had
it
not
been
the
enemy
would
have
seized
paducah
and
fortified
it
to
our
very
great
annoyance
when
the
national
troops
entered
the
town
the
citizens
were
taken
by
surprise
i
never
after
saw
such
consternation
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
people
men
women
and
children
came
out
of
their
doors
looking
pale
and
frightened
at
the
presence
of
the
invader
they
were
expecting
rebel
troops
that
day
in
fact
nearly
four
thousand
men
from
columbus
were
at
that
time
within
ten
or
fifteen
miles
of
paducah
on
their
way
to
occupy
the
place
i
had
but
two
regiments
and
one
battery
with
me
but
the
enemy
did
not
know
this
and
returned
to
columbus
i
stationed
my
troops
at
the
best
points
to
guard
the
roads
leading
into
the
city
left
gunboats
to
guard
the
river
fronts
and
by
noon
was
ready
to
start
on
my
return
to
cairo
before
leaving
however
i
addressed
a
short
printed
proclamation
to
the
citizens
of
paducah
assuring
them
of
our
peaceful
intentions
that
we
had
come
among
them
to
protect
them
against
the
enemies
of
our
country
and
that
all
who
chose
could
continue
their
usual
avocations
with
assurance
of
the
protection
of
the
government
this
was
evidently
a
relief
to
them
but
the
majority
would
have
much
preferred
the
presence
of
the
other
army
i
reinforced
paducah
rapidly
from
the
troops
at
cape
girardeau
and
a
day
or
two
later
general
smith
a
most
accomplished
soldier
reported
at
cairo
and
was
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
post
at
the
mouth
of
the
tennessee
in
a
short
time
it
was
well
fortified
and
a
detachment
was
sent
to
occupy
smithland
at
the
mouth
of
the
cumberland
the
state
government
of
kentucky
at
that
time
was
rebel
in
sentiment
but
wanted
to
preserve
an
armed
neutrality
between
the
north
and
the
south
and
the
governor
really
seemed
to
think
the
state
had
a
perfect
right
to
maintain
a
neutral
position
the
rebels
already
occupied
two
towns
in
the
state
columbus
and
hickman
on
the
mississippi
and
at
the
very
moment
the
national
troops
were
entering
paducah
from
the
ohio
front
general
lloyd
tilghman
a
confederate
with
his
staff
and
a
small
detachment
of
men
were
getting
out
in
the
other
direction
while
as
i
have
already
said
nearly
four
thousand
confederate
troops
were
on
kentucky
soil
on
their
way
to
take
possession
of
the
town
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
governor
and
of
those
who
thought
with
him
this
did
not
justify
the
national
authorities
in
invading
the
soil
of
kentucky
i
informed
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
what
i
was
doing
and
my
action
was
approved
by
the
majority
of
that
body
on
my
return
to
cairo
i
found
authority
from
department
headquarters
for
me
to
take
paducah
if
i
felt
strong
enough
but
very
soon
after
i
was
reprimanded
from
the
same
quarters
for
my
correspondence
with
the
legislature
and
warned
against
a
repetition
of
the
offence
soon
after
i
took
command
at
cairo
general
fremont
entered
into
arrangements
for
the
exchange
of
the
prisoners
captured
at
camp
jackson
in
the
month
of
may
i
received
orders
to
pass
them
through
my
lines
to
columbus
as
they
presented
themselves
with
proper
credentials
quite
a
number
of
these
prisoners
i
had
been
personally
acquainted
with
before
the
war
such
of
them
as
i
had
so
known
were
received
at
my
headquarters
as
old
acquaintances
and
ordinary
routine
business
was
not
disturbed
by
their
presence
on
one
occasion
when
several
were
present
in
my
office
my
intention
to
visit
cape
girardeau
the
next
day
to
inspect
the
troops
at
that
point
was
mentioned
something
transpired
which
postponed
my
trip
but
a
steamer
employed
by
the
government
was
passing
a
point
some
twenty
or
more
miles
above
cairo
the
next
day
when
a
section
of
rebel
artillery
with
proper
escort
brought
her
to
a
major
one
of
those
who
had
been
at
my
headquarters
the
day
before
came
at
once
aboard
and
after
some
search
made
a
direct
demand
for
my
delivery
it
was
hard
to
persuade
him
that
i
was
not
there
this
officer
was
major
barrett
of
louis
i
had
been
acquainted
with
his
family
before
the
war
chapter
xx
general
fremont
in
command
movement
against
belmont
battle
of
belmont
a
narrow
escape
after
the
battle
from
the
occupation
of
paducah
up
to
the
early
part
of
november
nothing
important
occurred
with
the
troops
under
my
command
i
was
reinforced
from
time
to
time
and
the
men
were
drilled
and
disciplined
preparatory
for
the
service
which
was
sure
to
come
by
the
of
november
i
had
not
fewer
than
men
most
of
them
under
good
drill
and
ready
to
meet
any
equal
body
of
men
who
like
themselves
had
not
yet
been
in
an
engagement
they
were
growing
impatient
at
lying
idle
so
long
almost
in
hearing
of
the
guns
of
the
enemy
they
had
volunteered
to
fight
against
i
asked
on
one
or
two
occasions
to
be
allowed
to
move
against
columbus
it
could
have
been
taken
soon
after
the
occupation
of
paducah
but
before
november
it
was
so
strongly
fortified
that
it
would
have
required
a
large
force
and
a
long
siege
to
capture
it
in
the
latter
part
of
october
general
fremont
took
the
field
in
person
and
moved
from
jefferson
city
against
general
sterling
price
who
was
then
in
the
state
of
missouri
with
a
considerable
command
about
the
first
of
november
i
was
directed
from
department
headquarters
to
make
a
demonstration
on
both
sides
of
the
mississippi
river
with
the
view
of
detaining
the
rebels
at
columbus
within
their
lines
before
my
troops
could
be
got
off
i
was
notified
from
the
same
quarter
that
there
were
some
of
the
enemy
on
the
francis
river
about
fifty
miles
west
or
from
cairo
and
was
ordered
to
send
another
force
against
them
i
dispatched
colonel
oglesby
at
once
with
troops
sufficient
to
compete
with
the
reported
number
of
the
enemy
on
the
word
came
from
the
same
source
that
the
rebels
were
about
to
detach
a
large
force
from
columbus
to
be
moved
by
boats
down
the
mississippi
and
up
the
white
river
in
arkansas
in
order
to
reinforce
price
and
i
was
directed
to
prevent
this
movement
if
possible
i
accordingly
sent
a
regiment
from
bird
point
under
colonel
wallace
to
overtake
and
reinforce
oglesby
with
orders
to
march
to
new
madrid
a
point
some
distance
below
columbus
on
the
missouri
side
at
the
same
time
i
directed
general
smith
to
move
all
the
troops
he
could
spare
from
paducah
directly
against
columbus
halting
them
however
a
few
miles
from
the
town
to
await
further
orders
from
me
then
i
gathered
up
all
the
troops
at
cairo
and
fort
holt
except
suitable
guards
and
moved
them
down
the
river
on
steamers
convoyed
by
two
gunboats
accompanying
them
myself
my
force
consisted
of
a
little
over
men
and
embraced
five
regiments
of
infantry
two
guns
and
two
companies
of
cavalry
we
dropped
down
the
river
on
the
to
within
about
six
miles
of
columbus
debarked
a
few
men
on
the
kentucky
side
and
established
pickets
to
connect
with
the
troops
from
paducah
i
had
no
orders
which
contemplated
an
attack
by
the
national
troops
nor
did
i
intend
anything
of
the
kind
when
i
started
out
from
cairo
but
after
we
started
i
saw
that
the
officers
and
men
were
elated
at
the
prospect
of
at
last
having
the
opportunity
of
doing
what
they
had
volunteered
to
do
fight
the
enemies
of
their
country
i
did
not
see
how
i
could
maintain
discipline
or
retain
the
confidence
of
my
command
if
we
should
return
to
cairo
without
an
effort
to
do
something
columbus
besides
being
strongly
fortified
contained
a
garrison
much
more
numerous
than
the
force
i
had
with
me
it
would
not
do
therefore
to
attack
that
point
about
two
on
the
morning
of
the
i
learned
that
the
enemy
was
crossing
troops
from
columbus
to
the
west
bank
to
be
dispatched
presumably
after
oglesby
i
knew
there
was
a
small
camp
of
confederates
at
belmont
immediately
opposite
columbus
and
i
speedily
resolved
to
push
down
the
river
land
on
the
missouri
side
capture
belmont
break
up
the
camp
and
return
accordingly
the
pickets
above
columbus
were
drawn
in
at
once
and
about
daylight
the
boats
moved
out
from
shore
in
an
hour
we
were
debarking
on
the
west
bank
of
the
mississippi
just
out
of
range
of
the
batteries
at
columbus
the
ground
on
the
west
shore
of
the
river
opposite
columbus
is
low
and
in
places
marshy
and
cut
up
with
sloughs
the
soil
is
rich
and
the
timber
large
and
heavy
there
were
some
small
clearings
between
belmont
and
the
point
where
we
landed
but
most
of
the
country
was
covered
with
the
native
forests
we
landed
in
front
of
a
cornfield
when
the
debarkation
commenced
i
took
a
regiment
down
the
river
to
post
it
as
a
guard
against
surprise
at
that
time
i
had
no
staff
officer
who
could
be
trusted
with
that
duty
in
the
woods
at
a
short
distance
below
the
clearing
i
found
a
depression
dry
at
the
time
but
which
at
high
water
became
a
slough
or
bayou
i
placed
the
men
in
the
hollow
gave
them
their
instructions
and
ordered
them
to
remain
there
until
they
were
properly
relieved
these
troops
with
the
gunboats
were
to
protect
our
transports
up
to
this
time
the
enemy
had
evidently
failed
to
divine
our
intentions
from
columbus
they
could
of
course
see
our
gunboats
and
transports
loaded
with
troops
but
the
force
from
paducah
was
threatening
them
from
the
land
side
and
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
if
columbus
was
our
object
we
would
separate
our
troops
by
a
wide
river
they
doubtless
thought
we
meant
to
draw
a
large
force
from
the
east
bank
then
embark
ourselves
land
on
the
east
bank
and
make
a
sudden
assault
on
columbus
before
their
divided
command
could
be
united
about
eight
we
started
from
the
point
of
debarkation
marching
by
the
flank
after
moving
in
this
way
for
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
i
halted
where
there
was
marshy
ground
covered
with
a
heavy
growth
of
timber
in
our
front
and
deployed
a
large
part
of
my
force
as
skirmishers
by
this
time
the
enemy
discovered
that
we
were
moving
upon
belmont
and
sent
out
troops
to
meet
us
soon
after
we
had
started
in
line
his
skirmishers
were
encountered
and
fighting
commenced
this
continued
growing
fiercer
and
fiercer
for
about
four
hours
the
enemy
being
forced
back
gradually
until
he
was
driven
into
his
camp
early
in
this
engagement
my
horse
was
shot
under
me
but
i
got
another
from
one
of
my
staff
and
kept
well
up
with
the
advance
until
the
river
was
reached
the
officers
and
men
engaged
at
belmont
were
then
under
fire
for
the
first
time
veterans
could
not
have
behaved
better
than
they
did
up
to
the
moment
of
reaching
the
rebel
camp
at
this
point
they
became
demoralized
from
their
victory
and
failed
to
reap
its
full
reward
the
enemy
had
been
followed
so
closely
that
when
he
reached
the
clear
ground
on
which
his
camp
was
pitched
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
over
the
river
bank
which
protected
him
from
our
shots
and
from
view
this
precipitate
retreat
at
the
last
moment
enabled
the
national
forces
to
pick
their
way
without
hinderance
through
the
abatis
the
only
artificial
defence
the
enemy
had
the
moment
the
camp
was
reached
our
men
laid
down
their
arms
and
commenced
rummaging
the
tents
to
pick
up
trophies
some
of
the
higher
officers
were
little
better
than
the
privates
they
galloped
about
from
one
cluster
of
men
to
another
and
at
every
halt
delivered
a
short
eulogy
upon
the
union
cause
and
the
achievements
of
the
command
all
this
time
the
troops
we
had
been
engaged
with
for
four
hours
lay
crouched
under
cover
of
the
river
bank
ready
to
come
up
and
surrender
if
summoned
to
do
so
but
finding
that
they
were
not
pursued
they
worked
their
way
up
the
river
and
came
up
on
the
bank
between
us
and
our
transports
i
saw
at
the
same
time
two
steamers
coming
from
the
columbus
side
towards
the
west
shore
above
us
black
or
gray
with
soldiers
from
to
roof
some
of
my
men
were
engaged
in
firing
from
captured
guns
at
empty
steamers
down
the
river
out
of
range
cheering
at
every
shot
i
tried
to
get
them
to
turn
their
guns
upon
the
loaded
steamers
above
and
not
so
far
away
my
efforts
were
in
vain
at
last
i
directed
my
staff
officers
to
set
fire
to
the
camps
this
drew
the
fire
of
the
enemy
guns
located
on
the
heights
of
columbus
they
had
abstained
from
firing
before
probably
because
they
were
afraid
of
hitting
their
own
men
or
they
may
have
supposed
until
the
camp
was
on
fire
that
it
was
still
in
the
possession
of
their
friends
about
this
time
too
the
men
we
had
driven
over
the
bank
were
seen
in
line
up
the
river
between
us
and
our
transports
the
alarm
surrounded
was
given
the
guns
of
the
enemy
and
the
report
of
being
surrounded
brought
officers
and
men
completely
under
control
at
first
some
of
the
officers
seemed
to
think
that
to
be
surrounded
was
to
be
placed
in
a
hopeless
position
where
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
surrender
but
when
i
announced
that
we
had
cut
our
way
in
and
could
cut
our
way
out
just
as
well
it
seemed
a
new
revelation
to
officers
and
soldiers
they
formed
line
rapidly
and
we
started
back
to
our
boats
with
the
men
deployed
as
skirmishers
as
they
had
been
on
entering
camp
the
enemy
was
soon
encountered
but
his
resistance
this
time
was
feeble
again
the
confederates
sought
shelter
under
the
river
banks
we
could
not
stop
however
to
pick
them
up
because
the
troops
we
had
seen
crossing
the
river
had
debarked
by
this
time
and
were
nearer
our
transports
than
we
were
it
would
be
prudent
to
get
them
behind
us
but
we
were
not
again
molested
on
our
way
to
the
boats
from
the
beginning
of
the
fighting
our
wounded
had
been
carried
to
the
houses
at
the
rear
near
the
place
of
debarkation
i
now
set
the
troops
to
bringing
their
wounded
to
the
boats
after
this
had
gone
on
for
some
little
time
i
rode
down
the
road
without
even
a
staff
officer
to
visit
the
guard
i
had
stationed
over
the
approach
to
our
transports
i
knew
the
enemy
had
crossed
over
from
columbus
in
considerable
numbers
and
might
be
expected
to
attack
us
as
we
were
embarking
this
guard
would
be
encountered
first
and
as
they
were
in
a
natural
intrenchment
would
be
able
to
hold
the
enemy
for
a
considerable
time
my
surprise
was
great
to
find
there
was
not
a
single
man
in
the
trench
riding
back
to
the
boat
i
found
the
officer
who
had
commanded
the
guard
and
learned
that
he
had
withdrawn
his
force
when
the
main
body
fell
back
at
first
i
ordered
the
guard
to
return
but
finding
that
it
would
take
some
time
to
get
the
men
together
and
march
them
back
to
their
position
i
countermanded
the
order
then
fearing
that
the
enemy
we
had
seen
crossing
the
river
below
might
be
coming
upon
us
unawares
i
rode
out
in
the
field
to
our
front
still
entirely
alone
to
observe
whether
the
enemy
was
passing
the
field
was
grown
up
with
corn
so
tall
and
thick
as
to
cut
off
the
view
of
even
a
person
on
horseback
except
directly
along
the
rows
even
in
that
direction
owing
to
the
overhanging
blades
of
corn
the
view
was
not
extensive
i
had
not
gone
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
when
i
saw
a
body
of
troops
marching
past
me
not
fifty
yards
away
i
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
my
horse
towards
the
river
and
started
back
first
in
a
walk
and
when
i
thought
myself
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
enemy
as
fast
as
my
horse
could
carry
me
when
at
the
river
bank
i
still
had
to
ride
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
point
where
the
nearest
transport
lay
the
cornfield
in
front
of
our
transports
terminated
at
the
edge
of
a
dense
forest
before
i
got
back
the
enemy
had
entered
this
forest
and
had
opened
a
brisk
fire
upon
the
boats
our
men
with
the
exception
of
details
that
had
gone
to
the
front
after
the
wounded
were
now
either
aboard
the
transports
or
very
near
them
those
who
were
not
aboard
soon
got
there
and
the
boats
pushed
off
i
was
the
only
man
of
the
national
army
between
the
rebels
and
our
transports
the
captain
of
a
boat
that
had
just
pushed
out
but
had
not
started
recognized
me
and
ordered
the
engineer
not
to
start
the
engine
he
then
had
a
plank
run
out
for
me
my
horse
seemed
to
take
in
the
situation
there
was
no
path
down
the
bank
and
every
one
acquainted
with
the
mississippi
river
knows
that
its
banks
in
a
natural
state
do
not
vary
at
any
great
angle
from
the
perpendicular
my
horse
put
his
fore
feet
over
the
bank
without
hesitation
or
urging
and
with
his
hind
feet
well
under
him
slid
down
the
bank
and
trotted
aboard
the
boat
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
away
over
a
single
gang
plank
i
dismounted
and
went
at
once
to
the
upper
deck
the
mississippi
river
was
low
on
the
of
november
so
that
the
banks
were
higher
than
the
heads
of
men
standing
on
the
upper
decks
of
the
steamers
the
rebels
were
some
distance
back
from
the
river
so
that
their
fire
was
high
and
did
us
but
little
harm
our
was
riddled
with
bullets
but
there
were
only
three
men
wounded
on
the
boats
two
of
whom
were
soldiers
when
i
first
went
on
deck
i
entered
the
captain
room
adjoining
the
and
threw
myself
on
a
sofa
i
did
not
keep
that
position
a
moment
but
rose
to
go
out
on
the
deck
to
observe
what
was
going
on
i
had
scarcely
left
when
a
musket
ball
entered
the
room
struck
the
head
of
the
sofa
passed
through
it
and
lodged
in
the
foot
when
the
enemy
opened
fire
on
the
transports
our
gunboats
returned
it
with
vigor
they
were
well
out
in
the
stream
and
some
distance
down
so
that
they
had
to
give
but
very
little
elevation
to
their
guns
to
clear
the
banks
of
the
river
their
position
very
nearly
enfiladed
the
line
of
the
enemy
while
he
was
marching
through
the
cornfield
the
execution
was
very
great
as
we
could
see
at
the
time
and
as
i
afterwards
learned
more
positively
we
were
very
soon
out
of
range
and
went
peacefully
on
our
way
to
cairo
every
man
feeling
that
belmont
was
a
great
victory
and
that
he
had
contributed
his
share
to
it
our
loss
at
belmont
was
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
about
of
our
wounded
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
we
returned
with
prisoners
and
two
guns
and
spiked
four
other
pieces
the
loss
of
the
enemy
as
officially
reported
was
men
killed
wounded
and
missing
we
had
engaged
about
men
exclusive
of
the
guard
left
with
the
transports
the
enemy
had
about
but
this
includes
the
troops
brought
over
from
columbus
who
were
not
engaged
in
the
first
defence
of
belmont
the
two
objects
for
which
the
battle
of
belmont
was
fought
were
fully
accomplished
the
enemy
gave
up
all
idea
of
detaching
troops
from
columbus
his
losses
were
very
heavy
for
that
period
of
the
war
columbus
was
beset
by
people
looking
for
their
wounded
or
dead
kin
to
take
them
home
for
medical
treatment
or
burial
i
learned
later
when
i
had
moved
further
south
that
belmont
had
caused
more
mourning
than
almost
any
other
battle
up
to
that
time
the
national
troops
acquired
a
confidence
in
themselves
at
belmont
that
did
not
desert
them
through
the
war
the
day
after
the
battle
i
met
some
officers
from
general
command
arranged
for
permission
to
bury
our
dead
at
belmont
and
also
commenced
negotiations
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
when
our
men
went
to
bury
their
dead
before
they
were
allowed
to
land
they
were
conducted
below
the
point
where
the
enemy
had
engaged
our
transports
some
of
the
officers
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
field
but
the
request
was
refused
with
the
statement
that
we
had
no
dead
there
while
on
the
i
mentioned
to
an
officer
whom
i
had
known
both
at
west
point
and
in
the
mexican
war
that
i
was
in
the
cornfield
near
their
troops
when
they
passed
that
i
had
been
on
horseback
and
had
worn
a
soldier
overcoat
at
the
time
this
officer
was
on
general
staff
he
said
both
he
and
the
general
had
seen
me
and
that
polk
had
said
to
his
men
there
is
a
yankee
you
may
try
your
marksmanship
on
him
if
you
wish
but
nobody
fired
at
me
belmont
was
severely
criticised
in
the
north
as
a
wholly
unnecessary
battle
barren
of
results
or
the
possibility
of
them
from
the
beginning
if
it
had
not
been
fought
colonel
oglesby
would
probably
have
been
captured
or
destroyed
with
his
three
thousand
men
then
i
should
have
been
culpable
indeed
chapter
xxi
general
halleck
in
command
commanding
the
district
of
cairo
movement
on
fort
henry
capture
of
fort
henry
while
at
cairo
i
had
frequent
opportunities
of
meeting
the
rebel
officers
of
the
columbus
garrison
they
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
coming
up
on
steamers
under
flags
of
truce
on
two
or
three
occasions
i
went
down
in
like
manner
when
one
of
their
boats
was
seen
coming
up
carrying
a
white
flag
a
gun
would
be
fired
from
the
lower
battery
at
fort
holt
throwing
a
shot
across
the
bow
as
a
signal
to
come
no
farther
i
would
then
take
a
steamer
and
with
my
staff
and
occasionally
a
few
other
officers
go
down
to
receive
the
party
there
were
several
officers
among
them
whom
i
had
known
before
both
at
west
point
and
in
mexico
seeing
these
officers
who
had
been
educated
for
the
profession
of
arms
both
at
school
and
in
actual
war
which
is
a
far
more
efficient
training
impressed
me
with
the
great
advantage
the
south
possessed
over
the
north
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
they
had
from
thirty
to
forty
per
cent
of
the
educated
soldiers
of
the
nation
they
had
no
standing
army
and
consequently
these
trained
soldiers
had
to
find
employment
with
the
troops
from
their
own
states
in
this
way
what
there
was
of
military
education
and
training
was
distributed
throughout
their
whole
army
the
whole
loaf
was
leavened
the
north
had
a
great
number
of
educated
and
trained
soldiers
but
the
bulk
of
them
were
still
in
the
army
and
were
retained
generally
with
their
old
commands
and
rank
until
the
war
had
lasted
many
months
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
there
was
what
was
known
as
the
regular
brigade
in
which
from
the
commanding
officer
down
to
the
youngest
second
lieutenant
every
one
was
educated
to
his
profession
so
too
with
many
of
the
batteries
all
the
officers
generally
four
in
number
to
each
were
men
educated
for
their
profession
some
of
these
went
into
battle
at
the
beginning
under
division
commanders
who
were
entirely
without
military
training
this
state
of
affairs
gave
me
an
idea
which
i
expressed
while
at
cairo
that
the
government
ought
to
disband
the
regular
army
with
the
exception
of
the
staff
corps
and
notify
the
disbanded
officers
that
they
would
receive
no
compensation
while
the
war
lasted
except
as
volunteers
the
register
should
be
kept
up
but
the
names
of
all
officers
who
were
not
in
the
volunteer
service
at
the
close
should
be
stricken
from
it
on
the
of
november
two
days
after
the
battle
of
belmont
halleck
superseded
general
fremont
in
command
of
the
department
of
the
missouri
the
limits
of
his
command
took
in
arkansas
and
west
kentucky
east
to
the
cumberland
river
from
the
battle
of
belmont
until
early
in
february
the
troops
under
my
command
did
little
except
prepare
for
the
long
struggle
which
proved
to
be
before
them
the
enemy
at
this
time
occupied
a
line
running
from
the
mississippi
river
at
columbus
to
bowling
green
and
mill
springs
kentucky
each
of
these
positions
was
strongly
fortified
as
were
also
points
on
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
near
the
tennessee
state
line
the
works
on
the
tennessee
were
called
fort
heiman
and
fort
henry
and
that
on
the
cumberland
was
fort
donelson
at
these
points
the
two
rivers
approached
within
eleven
miles
of
each
other
the
lines
of
rifle
pits
at
each
place
extended
back
from
the
water
at
least
two
miles
so
that
the
garrisons
were
in
reality
only
seven
miles
apart
these
positions
were
of
immense
importance
to
the
enemy
and
of
course
correspondingly
important
for
us
to
possess
ourselves
of
with
fort
henry
in
our
hands
we
had
a
navigable
stream
open
to
us
up
to
muscle
shoals
in
alabama
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
strikes
the
tennessee
at
eastport
mississippi
and
follows
close
to
the
banks
of
the
river
up
to
the
shoals
this
road
of
vast
importance
to
the
enemy
would
cease
to
be
of
use
to
them
for
through
traffic
the
moment
fort
henry
became
ours
fort
donelson
was
the
gate
to
nashville
a
place
of
great
military
and
political
importance
and
to
a
rich
country
extending
far
east
in
kentucky
these
two
points
in
our
possession
the
enemy
would
necessarily
be
thrown
back
to
the
memphis
and
charleston
road
or
to
the
boundary
of
the
cotton
states
and
as
before
stated
that
road
would
be
lost
to
them
for
through
communication
the
designation
of
my
command
had
been
changed
after
halleck
arrival
from
the
district
of
missouri
to
the
district
of
cairo
and
the
small
district
commanded
by
general
smith
embracing
the
mouths
of
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
had
been
added
to
my
jurisdiction
early
in
january
i
was
directed
by
general
mcclellan
through
my
department
commander
to
make
a
reconnoissance
in
favor
of
don
carlos
buell
who
commanded
the
department
of
the
ohio
with
headquarters
at
louisville
and
who
was
confronting
general
buckner
with
a
larger
confederate
force
at
bowling
green
it
was
supposed
that
buell
was
about
to
make
some
move
against
the
enemy
and
my
demonstration
was
intended
to
prevent
the
sending
of
troops
from
columbus
fort
henry
or
donelson
to
buckner
i
at
once
ordered
general
smith
to
send
a
force
up
the
west
bank
of
the
tennessee
to
threaten
forts
heiman
and
henry
mcclernand
at
the
same
time
with
a
force
of
men
was
sent
out
into
west
kentucky
threatening
columbus
with
one
column
and
the
tennessee
river
with
another
i
went
with
mcclernand
command
the
weather
was
very
bad
snow
and
rain
fell
the
roads
never
good
in
that
section
were
intolerable
we
were
out
more
than
a
week
splashing
through
the
mud
snow
and
rain
the
men
suffering
very
much
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
accomplished
the
enemy
did
not
send
reinforcements
to
bowling
green
and
general
george
thomas
fought
and
won
the
battle
of
mill
springs
before
we
returned
as
a
result
of
this
expedition
general
smith
reported
that
he
thought
it
practicable
to
capture
fort
heiman
this
fort
stood
on
high
ground
completely
commanding
fort
henry
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
its
possession
by
us
with
the
aid
of
our
gunboats
would
insure
the
capture
of
fort
henry
this
report
of
smith
confirmed
views
i
had
previously
held
that
the
true
line
of
operations
for
us
was
up
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
with
us
there
the
enemy
would
be
compelled
to
fall
back
on
the
east
and
west
entirely
out
of
the
state
of
kentucky
on
the
of
january
before
receiving
orders
for
this
expedition
i
had
asked
permission
of
the
general
commanding
the
department
to
go
to
see
him
at
louis
my
object
was
to
lay
this
plan
of
campaign
before
him
now
that
my
views
had
been
confirmed
by
so
able
a
general
as
smith
i
renewed
my
request
to
go
to
louis
on
what
i
deemed
important
military
business
the
leave
was
granted
but
not
graciously
i
had
known
general
halleck
but
very
slightly
in
the
old
army
not
having
met
him
either
at
west
point
or
during
the
mexican
war
i
was
received
with
so
little
cordiality
that
i
perhaps
stated
the
object
of
my
visit
with
less
clearness
than
i
might
have
done
and
i
had
not
uttered
many
sentences
before
i
was
cut
short
as
if
my
plan
was
preposterous
i
returned
to
cairo
very
much
crestfallen
foote
commanded
the
little
fleet
of
gunboats
then
in
the
neighborhood
of
cairo
and
though
in
another
branch
of
the
service
was
subject
to
the
command
of
general
halleck
he
and
i
consulted
freely
upon
military
matters
and
he
agreed
with
me
perfectly
as
to
the
feasibility
of
the
campaign
up
the
tennessee
notwithstanding
the
rebuff
i
had
received
from
my
immediate
chief
i
therefore
on
the
of
january
renewed
the
suggestion
by
telegraph
that
if
permitted
i
could
take
and
hold
fort
henry
on
the
tennessee
this
time
i
was
backed
by
foote
who
sent
a
similar
dispatch
on
the
i
wrote
fully
in
support
of
the
proposition
on
the
of
february
i
received
full
instructions
from
department
headquarters
to
move
upon
fort
henry
on
the
the
expedition
started
in
february
there
were
quite
a
good
many
steamers
laid
up
at
cairo
for
want
of
employment
the
mississippi
river
being
closed
against
navigation
below
that
point
there
were
also
many
men
in
the
town
whose
occupation
had
been
following
the
river
in
various
capacities
from
captain
down
to
deck
hand
but
there
were
not
enough
of
either
boats
or
men
to
move
at
one
time
the
men
i
proposed
to
take
with
me
up
the
tennessee
i
loaded
the
boats
with
more
than
half
the
force
however
and
sent
general
mcclernand
in
command
i
followed
with
one
of
the
later
boats
and
found
mcclernand
had
stopped
very
properly
nine
miles
below
fort
henry
seven
gunboats
under
foote
had
accompanied
the
advance
the
transports
we
had
with
us
had
to
return
to
paducah
to
bring
up
a
division
from
there
with
general
smith
in
command
before
sending
the
boats
back
i
wanted
to
get
the
troops
as
near
to
the
enemy
as
i
could
without
coming
within
range
of
their
guns
there
was
a
stream
emptying
into
the
tennessee
on
the
east
side
apparently
at
about
long
range
distance
below
the
fort
on
account
of
the
narrow
separating
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
at
that
point
the
stream
must
be
insignificant
at
ordinary
stages
but
when
we
were
there
in
february
it
was
a
torrent
it
would
facilitate
the
investment
of
fort
henry
materially
if
the
troops
could
be
landed
south
of
that
stream
to
test
whether
this
could
be
done
i
boarded
the
gunboat
essex
and
requested
captain
wm
porter
commanding
it
to
approach
the
fort
to
draw
its
fire
after
we
had
gone
some
distance
past
the
mouth
of
the
stream
we
drew
the
fire
of
the
fort
which
fell
much
short
of
us
in
consequence
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
return
and
bring
the
troops
to
the
upper
side
of
the
creek
when
the
enemy
opened
upon
us
with
a
rifled
gun
that
sent
shot
far
beyond
us
and
beyond
the
stream
one
shot
passed
very
near
where
captain
porter
and
i
were
standing
struck
the
deck
near
the
stern
penetrated
and
passed
through
the
cabin
and
so
out
into
the
river
we
immediately
turned
back
and
the
troops
were
debarked
below
the
mouth
of
the
creek
when
the
landing
was
completed
i
returned
with
the
transports
to
paducah
to
hasten
up
the
balance
of
the
troops
i
got
back
on
the
with
the
advance
the
remainder
following
as
rapidly
as
the
steamers
could
carry
them
at
ten
at
night
on
the
the
whole
command
was
not
yet
up
being
anxious
to
commence
operations
as
soon
as
possible
before
the
enemy
could
reinforce
heavily
i
issued
my
orders
for
an
advance
at
on
the
i
felt
sure
that
all
the
troops
would
be
up
by
that
time
fort
henry
occupies
a
bend
in
the
river
which
gave
the
guns
in
the
water
battery
a
direct
fire
down
the
stream
the
camp
outside
the
fort
was
intrenched
with
rifle
pits
and
outworks
two
miles
back
on
the
road
to
donelson
and
dover
the
garrison
of
the
fort
and
camp
was
about
with
strong
reinforcements
from
donelson
halted
some
miles
out
there
were
seventeen
heavy
guns
in
the
fort
the
river
was
very
high
the
banks
being
overflowed
except
where
the
bluffs
come
to
the
water
edge
a
portion
of
the
ground
on
which
fort
henry
stood
was
two
feet
deep
in
water
below
the
water
extended
into
the
woods
several
hundred
yards
back
from
the
bank
on
the
east
side
on
the
west
bank
fort
heiman
stood
on
high
ground
completely
commanding
fort
henry
the
distance
from
fort
henry
to
donelson
is
but
eleven
miles
the
two
positions
were
so
important
to
the
enemy
as
he
saw
his
interest
that
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
reinforcements
would
come
from
every
quarter
from
which
they
could
be
got
prompt
action
on
our
part
was
imperative
the
plan
was
for
the
troops
and
gunboats
to
start
at
the
same
moment
the
troops
were
to
invest
the
garrison
and
the
gunboats
to
attack
the
fort
at
close
quarters
general
smith
was
to
land
a
brigade
of
his
division
on
the
west
bank
during
the
night
of
the
and
get
it
in
rear
of
heiman
at
the
hour
designated
the
troops
and
gunboats
started
general
smith
found
fort
heiman
had
been
evacuated
before
his
men
arrived
the
gunboats
soon
engaged
the
water
batteries
at
very
close
quarters
but
the
troops
which
were
to
invest
fort
henry
were
delayed
for
want
of
roads
as
well
as
by
the
dense
forest
and
the
high
water
in
what
would
in
dry
weather
have
been
unimportant
beds
of
streams
this
delay
made
no
difference
in
the
result
on
our
first
appearance
tilghman
had
sent
his
entire
command
with
the
exception
of
about
one
hundred
men
left
to
man
the
guns
in
the
fort
to
the
outworks
on
the
road
to
dover
and
donelson
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
range
of
the
guns
of
our
navy
and
before
any
attack
on
the
he
had
ordered
them
to
retreat
on
donelson
he
stated
in
his
subsequent
report
that
the
defence
was
intended
solely
to
give
his
troops
time
to
make
their
escape
tilghman
was
captured
with
his
staff
and
ninety
men
as
well
as
the
armament
of
the
fort
the
ammunition
and
whatever
stores
were
there
our
cavalry
pursued
the
retreating
column
towards
donelson
and
picked
up
two
guns
and
a
few
stragglers
but
the
enemy
had
so
much
the
start
that
the
pursuing
force
did
not
get
in
sight
of
any
except
the
stragglers
all
the
gunboats
engaged
were
hit
many
times
the
damage
however
beyond
what
could
be
repaired
by
a
small
expenditure
of
money
was
slight
except
to
the
essex
a
shell
penetrated
the
boiler
of
that
vessel
and
exploded
it
killing
and
wounding
men
nineteen
of
whom
were
soldiers
who
had
been
detailed
to
act
with
the
navy
on
several
occasions
during
the
war
such
details
were
made
when
the
complement
of
men
with
the
navy
was
insufficient
for
the
duty
before
them
after
the
fall
of
fort
henry
captain
phelps
commanding
the

at
my
request
ascended

investment

the

operations

surrender
of

i
informed
the
department
commander
of
our
success
at
fort
henry
and
that
on
the
i
would
take
fort
donelson
but
the
rain
continued
to
fall
so
heavily
that
the
roads
became
impassable
for
artillery
and
wagon
trains
then
too
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
proceed
without
the
gunboats
at
least
it
would
have
been
leaving
behind
a
valuable
part
of
our
available
force
on
the
the
day
after
the
fall
of
fort
henry
i
took
my
staff
and
the
cavalry
a
part
of
one
regiment
and
made
a
reconnoissance
to
within
about
a
mile
of
the
outer
line
of
works
at
donelson
i
had
known
general
pillow
in
mexico
and
judged
that
with
any
force
no
matter
how
small
i
could
march
up
to
within
gunshot
of
any
intrenchments
he
was
given
to
hold
i
said
this
to
the
officers
of
my
staff
at
the
time
i
knew
that
floyd
was
in
command
but
he
was
no
soldier
and
i
judged
that
he
would
yield
to
pillow
pretensions
i
met
as
i
expected
no
opposition
in
making
the
reconnoissance
and
besides
learning
the
topography
of
the
country
on
the
way
and
around
fort
donelson
found
that
there
were
two
roads
available
for
marching
one
leading
to
the
village
of
dover
the
other
to
donelson
fort
donelson
is
two
miles
north
or
down
the
river
from
dover
the
fort
as
it
stood
in
embraced
about
one
hundred
acres
of
land
on
the
east
it
fronted
the
cumberland
to
the
north
it
faced
creek
a
small
stream
which
at
that
time
was
deep
and
wide
because
of
the
from
the
river
on
the
south
was
another
small
stream
or
rather
a
ravine
opening
into
the
cumberland
this
also
was
filled
with
from
the
river
the
fort
stood
on
high
ground
some
of
it
as
much
as
a
hundred
feet
above
the
cumberland
strong
protection
to
the
heavy
guns
in
the
water
batteries
had
been
obtained
by
cutting
away
places
for
them
in
the
bluff
to
the
west
there
was
a
line
of
rifle
pits
some
two
miles
back
from
the
river
at
the
farthest
point
this
line
ran
generally
along
the
crest
of
high
ground
but
in
one
place
crossed
a
ravine
which
opens
into
the
river
between
the
village
and
the
fort
the
ground
inside
and
outside
of
this
intrenched
line
was
very
broken
and
generally
wooded
the
trees
outside
of
the
had
been
cut
down
for
a
considerable
way
out
and
had
been
felled
so
that
their
tops
lay
outwards
from
the
intrenchments
the
limbs
had
been
trimmed
and
pointed
and
thus
formed
an
abatis
in
front
of
the
greater
part
of
the
line
outside
of
this
intrenched
line
and
extending
about
half
the
entire
length
of
it
is
a
ravine
running
north
and
south
and
opening
into
hickman
creek
at
a
point
north
of
the
fort
the
entire
side
of
this
ravine
next
to
the
works
was
one
long
abatis
general
halleck
commenced
his
efforts
in
all
quarters
to
get
reinforcements
to
forward
to
me
immediately
on
my
departure
from
cairo
general
hunter
sent
men
freely
from
kansas
and
a
large
division
under
general
nelson
from
buell
army
was
also
dispatched
orders
went
out
from
the
war
department
to
consolidate
fragments
of
companies
that
were
being
recruited
in
the
western
states
so
as
to
make
full
companies
and
to
consolidate
companies
into
regiments
general
halleck
did
not
approve
or
disapprove
of
my
going
to
fort
donelson
he
said
nothing
whatever
to
me
on
the
subject
he
informed
buell
on
the
that
i
would
march
against
fort
donelson
the
next
day
but
on
the
he
directed
me
to
fortify
fort
henry
strongly
particularly
to
the
land
side
saying
that
he
forwarded
me
intrenching
tools
for
that
purpose
i
received
this
dispatch
in
front
of
fort
donelson
i
was
very
impatient
to
get
to
fort
donelson
because
i
knew
the
importance
of
the
place
to
the
enemy
and
supposed
he
would
reinforce
it
rapidly
i
felt
that
men
on
the
would
be
more
effective
than
a
month
later
i
asked
foote
therefore
to
order
his
gunboats
still
about
cairo
to
proceed
up
the
cumberland
river
and
not
to
wait
for
those
gone
to
eastport
and
florence
but
the
others
got
back
in
time
and
we
started
on
the
i
had
moved
mcclernand
out
a
few
miles
the
night
before
so
as
to
leave
the
road
as
free
as
possible
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
the
first
reinforcement
reached
me
on
transports
it
was
a
brigade
composed
of
six
full
regiments
commanded
by
colonel
thayer
of
nebraska
as
the
gunboats
were
going
around
to
donelson
by
the
tennessee
ohio
and
cumberland
rivers
i
directed
thayer
to
turn
about
and
go
under
their
convoy
i
started
from
fort
henry
with
men
including
eight
batteries
and
part
of
a
regiment
of
cavalry
and
meeting
with
no
obstruction
to
detain
us
the
advance
arrived
in
front
of
the
enemy
by
noon
that
afternoon
and
the
next
day
were
spent
in
taking
up
ground
to
make
the
investment
as
complete
as
possible
general
smith
had
been
directed
to
leave
a
portion
of
his
division
behind
to
guard
forts
henry
and
heiman
he
left
general
lew
wallace
with
men
with
the
remainder
of
his
division
he
occupied
our
left
extending
to
hickman
creek
mcclernand
was
on
the
right
and
covered
the
roads
running
south
and
from
dover
his
right
extended
to
the
up
the
ravine
opening
into
the
cumberland
south
of
the
village
the
troops
were
not
intrenched
but
the
nature
of
the
ground
was
such
that
they
were
just
as
well
protected
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
as
if
had
been
thrown
up
our
line
was
generally
along
the
crest
of
ridges
the
artillery
was
protected
by
being
sunk
in
the
ground
the
men
who
were
not
serving
the
guns
were
perfectly
covered
from
fire
on
taking
position
a
little
back
from
the
crest
the
greatest
suffering
was
from
want
of
shelter
it
was
midwinter
and
during
the
siege
we
had
rain
and
snow
thawing
and
freezing
alternately
it
would
not
do
to
allow
except
far
down
the
hill
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
and
it
would
not
do
to
allow
many
of
the
troops
to
remain
there
at
the
same
time
in
the
march
over
from
fort
henry
numbers
of
the
men
had
thrown
away
their
blankets
and
overcoats
there
was
therefore
much
discomfort
and
absolute
suffering
during
the
and
and
until
the
arrival
of
wallace
and
thayer
on
the
the
national
forces
composed
of
but
men
without
intrenchments
confronted
an
intrenched
army
of
without
conflict
further
than
what
was
brought
on
by
ourselves
only
one
gunboat
had
arrived
there
was
a
little
skirmishing
each
day
brought
on
by
the
movement
of
our
troops
in
securing
commanding
positions
but
there
was
no
actual
fighting
during
this
time
except
once
on
the
in
front
of
mcclernand
command
that
general
had
undertaken
to
capture
a
battery
of
the
enemy
which
was
annoying
his
men
without
orders
or
authority
he
sent
three
regiments
to
make
the
assault
the
battery
was
in
the
main
line
of
the
enemy
which
was
defended
by
his
whole
army
present
of
course
the
assault
was
a
failure
and
of
course
the
loss
on
our
side
was
great
for
the
number
of
men
engaged
in
this
assault
colonel
william
morrison
fell
badly
wounded
up
to
this
time
the
surgeons
with
the
army
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
room
in
the
houses
near
our
line
for
all
the
sick
and
wounded
but
now
hospitals
were
overcrowded
owing
however
to
the
energy
and
skill
of
the
surgeons
the
suffering
was
not
so
great
as
it
might
have
been
the
hospital
arrangements
at
fort
donelson
were
as
complete
as
it
was
possible
to
make
them
considering
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
the
lack
of
tents
in
a
sparsely
settled
country
where
the
houses
were
generally
of
but
one
or
two
rooms
on
the
return
of
captain
walke
to
fort
henry
on
the
i
had
requested
him
to
take
the
vessels
that
had
accompanied
him
on
his
expedition
up
the
tennessee
and
get
possession
of
the
cumberland
as
far
up
towards
donelson
as
possible
he
started
without
delay
taking
however
only
his
own
gunboat
the
carondelet
towed
by
the
steamer
alps
captain
walke
arrived
a
few
miles
below
donelson
on
the
a
little
after
noon
about
the
time
the
advance
of
troops
reached
a
point
within
gunshot
of
the
fort
on
the
land
side
he
engaged
the
water
batteries
at
long
range
on
the
i
informed
him
of
my
arrival
the
day
before
and
of
the
establishment
of
most
of
our
batteries
requesting
him
at
the
same
time
to
attack
again
that
day
so
that
i
might
take
advantage
of
any
diversion
the
attack
was
made
and
many
shots
fell
within
the
fort
creating
some
consternation
as
we
now
know
the
investment
on
the
land
side
was
made
as
complete
as
the
number
of
troops
engaged
would
admit
of
during
the
night
of
the
foote
arrived
with
the
louis
louisville
and
pittsburg
and
the
wooden
gunboats
tyler
and
conestoga
convoying
thayer
brigade
on
the
morning
of
the
thayer
was
landed
wallace
whom
i
had
ordered
over
from
fort
henry
also
arrived
about
the
same
time
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
commanding
a
brigade
belonging
to
the
division
of
general
smith
these
troops
were
now
restored
to
the
division
they
belonged
to
and
general
lew
wallace
was
assigned
to
the
command
of
a
division
composed
of
the
brigade
of
colonel
thayer
and
other
reinforcements
that
arrived
the
same
day
this
new
division
was
assigned
to
the
centre
giving
the
two
flanking
divisions
an
opportunity
to
close
up
and
form
a
stronger
line
the
plan
was
for
the
troops
to
hold
the
enemy
within
his
lines
while
the
gunboats
should
attack
the
water
batteries
at
close
quarters
and
silence
his
guns
if
possible
some
of
the
gunboats
were
to
run
the
batteries
get
above
the
fort
and
above
the
village
of
dover
i
had
ordered
a
reconnoissance
made
with
the
view
of
getting
troops
to
the
river
above
dover
in
case
they
should
be
needed
there
that
position
attained
by
the
gunboats
it
would
have
been
but
a
question
of
time
and
a
very
short
time
too
when
the
garrison
would
have
been
compelled
to
surrender
by
three
in
the
afternoon
of
the
foote
was
ready
and
advanced
upon
the
water
batteries
with
his
entire
fleet
after
coming
in
range
of
the
batteries
of
the
enemy
the
advance
was
slow
but
a
constant
fire
was
delivered
from
every
gun
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
fort
i
occupied
a
position
on
shore
from
which
i
could
see
the
advancing
navy
the
leading
boat
got
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
water
battery
not
further
off
i
think
than
two
hundred
yards
and
i
soon
saw
one
and
then
another
of
them
dropping
down
the
river
visibly
disabled
then
the
whole
fleet
followed
and
the
engagement
closed
for
the
day
the
gunboat
which
foote
was
on
besides
having
been
hit
about
sixty
times
several
of
the
shots
passing
through
near
the
waterline
had
a
shot
enter
the
which
killed
the
pilot
carried
away
the
wheel
and
wounded
the
himself
the
of
another
vessel
were
carried
away
and
she
too
dropped
helplessly
back
two
others
had
their
so
injured
that
they
scarcely
formed
a
protection
to
the
men
at
the
wheel
the
enemy
had
evidently
been
much
demoralized
by
the
assault
but
they
were
jubilant
when
they
saw
the
disabled
vessels
dropping
down
the
river
entirely
out
of
the
control
of
the
men
on
board
of
course
i
only
witnessed
the
falling
back
of
our
gunboats
and
felt
sad
enough
at
the
time
over
the
repulse
subsequent
reports
now
published
show
that
the
enemy
telegraphed
a
great
victory
to
richmond
the
sun
went
down
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
leaving
the
army
confronting
fort
donelson
anything
but
comforted
over
the
prospects
the
weather
had
turned
intensely
cold
the
men
were
without
tents
and
could
not
keep
up
fires
where
most
of
them
had
to
stay
and
as
previously
stated
many
had
thrown
away
their
overcoats
and
blankets
two
of
the
strongest
of
our
gunboats
had
been
disabled
presumably
beyond
the
possibility
of
rendering
any
present
assistance
i
retired
this
night
not
knowing
but
that
i
would
have
to
intrench
my
position
and
bring
up
tents
for
the
men
or
build
huts
under
the
cover
of
the
hills
on
the
morning
of
the
before
it
was
yet
broad
day
a
messenger
from
foote
handed
me
a
note
expressing
a
desire
to
see
me
on
the
and
saying
that
he
had
been
injured
the
day
before
so
much
that
he
could
not
come
himself
to
me
i
at
once
made
my
preparations
for
starting
i
directed
my
to
notify
each
of
the
division
commanders
of
my
absence
and
instruct
them
to
do
nothing
to
bring
on
an
engagement
until
they
received
further
orders
but
to
hold
their
positions
from
the
heavy
rains
that
had
fallen
for
days
and
weeks
preceding
and
from
the
constant
use
of
the
roads
between
the
troops
and
the
landing
four
to
seven
miles
below
these
roads
had
become
cut
up
so
as
to
be
hardly
passable
the
intense
cold
of
the
night
of
the
had
frozen
the
ground
solid
this
made
travel
on
horseback
even
slower
than
through
the
mud
but
i
went
as
fast
as
the
roads
would
allow
when
i
reached
the
fleet
i
found
the
was
anchored
out
in
the
stream
a
small
boat
however
awaited
my
arrival
and
i
was
soon
on
board
with
the
he
explained
to
me
in
short
the
condition
in
which
he
was
left
by
the
engagement
of
the
evening
before
and
suggested
that
i
should
intrench
while
he
returned
to
mound
city
with
his
disabled
boats
expressing
at
the
time
the
belief
that
he
could
have
the
necessary
repairs
made
and
be
back
in
ten
days
i
saw
the
absolute
necessity
of
his
gunboats
going
into
hospital
and
did
not
know
but
i
should
be
forced
to
the
alternative
of
going
through
a
siege
but
the
enemy
relieved
me
from
this
necessity
when
i
left
the
national
line
to
visit
foote
i
had
no
idea
that
there
would
be
any
engagement
on
land
unless
i
brought
it
on
myself
the
conditions
for
battle
were
much
more
favorable
to
us
than
they
had
been
for
the
first
two
days
of
the
investment
from
the
to
the
we
had
but
men
of
all
arms
and
no
gunboats
now
we
had
been
reinforced
by
a
fleet
of
six
naval
vessels
a
large
division
of
troops
under
general
wallace
and
men
brought
over
from
fort
henry
belonging
to
the
division
of
smith
the
enemy
however
had
taken
the
initiative
just
as
i
landed
i
met
captain
hillyer
of
my
staff
white
with
fear
not
for
his
personal
safety
but
for
the
safety
of
the
national
troops
he
said
the
enemy
had
come
out
of
his
lines
in
full
force
and
attacked
and
scattered
mcclernand
division
which
was
in
full
retreat
the
roads
as
i
have
said
were
unfit
for
making
fast
time
but
i
got
to
my
command
as
soon
as
possible
the
attack
had
been
made
on
the
national
right
i
was
some
four
or
five
miles
north
of
our
left
the
line
was
about
three
miles
long
in
reaching
the
point
where
the
disaster
had
occurred
i
had
to
pass
the
divisions
of
smith
and
wallace
i
saw
no
sign
of
excitement
on
the
portion
of
the
line
held
by
smith
wallace
was
nearer
the
scene
of
conflict
and
had
taken
part
in
it
he
had
at
an
opportune
time
sent
thayer
brigade
to
the
support
of
mcclernand
and
thereby
contributed
to
hold
the
enemy
within
his
lines
i
saw
everything
favorable
for
us
along
the
line
of
our
left
and
centre
when
i
came
to
the
right
appearances
were
different
the
enemy
had
come
out
in
full
force
to
cut
his
way
out
and
make
his
escape
division
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
attack
from
this
combined
force
his
men
had
stood
up
gallantly
until
the
ammunition
in
their
gave
out
there
was
abundance
of
ammunition
near
by
lying
on
the
ground
in
boxes
but
at
that
stage
of
the
war
it
was
not
all
of
our
commanders
of
regiments
brigades
or
even
divisions
who
had
been
educated
up
to
the
point
of
seeing
that
their
men
were
constantly
supplied
with
ammunition
during
an
engagement
when
the
men
found
themselves
without
ammunition
they
could
not
stand
up
against
troops
who
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
it
the
division
broke
and
a
portion
fled
but
most
of
the
men
as
they
were
not
pursued
only
fell
back
out
of
range
of
the
fire
of
the
enemy
it
must
have
been
about
this
time
that
thayer
pushed
his
brigade
in
between
the
enemy
and
those
of
our
troops
that
were
without
ammunition
at
all
events
the
enemy
fell
back
within
his
intrenchments
and
was
there
when
i
got
on
the
field
i
saw
the
men
standing
in
knots
talking
in
the
most
excited
manner
no
officer
seemed
to
be
giving
any
directions
the
soldiers
had
their
muskets
but
no
ammunition
while
there
were
tons
of
it
close
at
hand
i
heard
some
of
the
men
say
that
the
enemy
had
come
out
with
knapsacks
and
haversacks
filled
with
rations
they
seemed
to
think
this
indicated
a
determination
on
his
part
to
stay
out
and
fight
just
as
long
as
the
provisions
held
out
i
turned
to
colonel
webster
of
my
staff
who
was
with
me
and
said
some
of
our
men
are
pretty
badly
demoralized
but
the
enemy
must
be
more
so
for
he
has
attempted
to
force
his
way
out
but
has
fallen
back
the
one
who
attacks
first
now
will
be
victorious
and
the
enemy
will
have
to
be
in
a
hurry
if
he
gets
ahead
of
me
i
determined
to
make
the
assault
at
once
on
our
left
it
was
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
enemy
had
started
to
march
out
with
his
entire
force
except
a
few
pickets
and
if
our
attack
could
be
made
on
the
left
before
the
enemy
could
redistribute
his
forces
along
the
line
we
would
find
but
little
opposition
except
from
the
intervening
abatis
i
directed
colonel
webster
to
ride
with
me
and
call
out
to
the
men
as
we
passed
fill
your
quick
and
get
into
line
the
enemy
is
trying
to
escape
and
he
must
not
be
permitted
to
do
so
this
acted
like
a
charm
the
men
only
wanted
some
one
to
give
them
a
command
we
rode
rapidly
to
smith
quarters
when
i
explained
the
situation
to
him
and
directed
him
to
charge
the
enemy
works
in
his
front
with
his
whole
division
saying
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
find
nothing
but
a
very
thin
line
to
contend
with
the
general
was
off
in
an
incredibly
short
time
going
in
advance
himself
to
keep
his
men
from
firing
while
they
were
working
their
way
through
the
abatis
intervening
between
them
and
the
enemy
the
outer
line
of
was
passed
and
the
night
of
the
general
smith
with
much
of
his
division
bivouacked
within
the
lines
of
the
enemy
there
was
now
no
doubt
but
that
the
confederates
must
surrender
or
be
captured
the
next
day
there
seems
from
subsequent
accounts
to
have
been
much
consternation
particularly
among
the
officers
of
high
rank
in
dover
during
the
night
of
the
general
floyd
the
commanding
officer
who
was
a
man
of
talent
enough
for
any
civil
position
was
no
soldier
and
possibly
did
not
possess
the
elements
of
one
he
was
further
unfitted
for
command
for
the
reason
that
his
conscience
must
have
troubled
him
and
made
him
afraid
as
secretary
of
war
he
had
taken
a
solemn
oath
to
maintain
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
to
uphold
the
same
against
all
its
enemies
he
had
betrayed
that
trust
as
secretary
of
war
he
was
reported
through
the
northern
press
to
have
scattered
the
little
army
the
country
had
so
that
the
most
of
it
could
be
picked
up
in
detail
when
secession
occurred
about
a
year
before
leaving
the
cabinet
he
had
removed
arms
from
northern
to
southern
arsenals
he
continued
in
the
cabinet
of
president
buchanan
until
about
the
of
january
while
he
was
working
vigilantly
for
the
establishment
of
a
confederacy
made
out
of
united
states
territory
well
may
he
have
been
afraid
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
national
troops
he
would
no
doubt
have
been
tried
for
misappropriating

not

treason
had
he
been
captured
general
pillow
next
in
command
was
conceited
and
prided
himself
much
on
his
services
in
the
mexican
war
he
telegraphed
to
general
johnston
at
nashville
after
our
men
were
within
the
rebel
and
almost
on
the
eve
of
his
making
his
escape
that
the
southern
troops
had
had
great
success
all
day
johnston
forwarded
the
dispatch
to
richmond
while
the
authorities
at
the
capital
were
reading
it
floyd
and
pillow
were
fugitives
a
council
of
war
was
held
by
the
enemy
at
which
all
agreed
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
hold
out
longer
general
buckner
who
was
third
in
rank
in
the
garrison
but
much
the
most
capable
soldier
seems
to
have
regarded
it
a
duty
to
hold
the
fort
until
the
general
commanding
the
department
johnston
should
get
back
to
his
headquarters
at
nashville
buckner
report
shows
however
that
he
considered
donelson
lost
and
that
any
attempt
to
hold
the
place
longer
would
be
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
command
being
assured
that
johnston
was
already
in
nashville
buckner
too
agreed
that
surrender
was
the
proper
thing
floyd
turned
over
the
command
to
pillow
who
declined
it
it
then
devolved
upon
buckner
who
accepted
the
responsibility
of
the
position
floyd
and
pillow
took
possession
of
all
the
river
transports
at
dover
and
before
morning
both
were
on
their
way
to
nashville
with
the
brigade
formerly
commanded
by
floyd
and
some
other
troops
in
all
about
some
marched
up
the
east
bank
of
the
cumberland
others
went
on
the
steamers
during
the
night
forrest
also
with
his
cavalry
and
some
other
troops
about
a
thousand
in
all
made
their
way
out
passing
between
our
right
and
the
river
they
had
to
ford
or
swim
over
the
in
the
little
creek
just
south
of
dover
before
daylight

brought
to
me
the

upon

of

of

is

no

except

can
be

i
propose
to

upon

i

very
respectfully
your

to
this
i
received
the
following
reply

february
to
brig
grant
army
sir
the
distribution
of
the
forces
under
my
command
incident
to
an
unexpected
change
of
commanders
and
the
overwhelming
force
under
your
command
compel
me
notwithstanding
the
brilliant
success
of
the
confederate
arms
yesterday
to
accept
the
ungenerous
and
unchivalrous
terms
which
you
propose
i
am
sir
your
very
buckner
brig
a
general
buckner
as
soon
as
he
had
dispatched
the
first
of
the
above
letters
sent
word
to
his
different
commanders
on
the
line
of
notifying
them
that
he
had
made
a
proposition
looking
to
the
surrender
of
the
garrison
and
directing
them
to
notify
national
troops
in
their
front
so
that
all
fighting
might
be
prevented
white
flags
were
stuck
at
intervals
along
the
line
of
but
none
over
the
fort
as
soon
as
the
last
letter
from
buckner
was
received
i
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
to
dover
general
wallace
i
found
had
preceded
me
an
hour
or
more
i
presume
that
seeing
white
flags
exposed
in
his
front
he
rode
up
to
see
what
they
meant
and
not
being
fired
upon
or
halted
he
kept
on
until
he
found
himself
at
the
headquarters
of
general
buckner
i
had
been
at
west
point
three
years
with
buckner
and
afterwards
served
with
him
in
the
army
so
that
we
were
quite
well
acquainted
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
which
was
very
friendly
he
said
to
me
that
if
he
had
been
in
command
i
would
not
have
got
up
to
donelson
as
easily
as
i
did
i
told
him
that
if
he
had
been
in
command
i
should
not
have
tried
in
the
way
i
did
i
had
invested
their
lines
with
a
smaller
force
than
they
had
to
defend
them
and
at
the
same
time
had
sent
a
brigade
full
strong
around
by
water
i
had
relied
very
much
upon
their
commander
to
allow
me
to
come
safely
up
to
the
outside
of
their
works
i
asked
general
buckner
about
what
force
he
had
to
surrender
he
replied
that
he
could
not
tell
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
that
all
the
sick
and
weak
had
been
sent
to
nashville
while
we
were
about
fort
henry
that
floyd
and
pillow
had
left
during
the
night
taking
many
men
with
them
and
that
forrest
and
probably
others
had
also
escaped
during
the
preceding
night
the
number
of
casualties
he
could
not
tell
but
he
said
i
would
not
find
fewer
than
nor
more
than
he
asked
permission
to
send
parties
outside
of
the
lines
to
bury
his
dead
who
had
fallen
on
the
when
they
tried
to
get
out
i
gave
directions
that
his
permit
to
pass
our
limits
should
be
recognized
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
privilege
was
abused
but
it
familiarized
our
guards
so
much
with
the
sight
of
confederates
passing
to
and
fro
that
i
have
no
doubt
many
got
beyond
our
pickets
unobserved
and
went
on
the
most
of
the
men
who
went
in
that
way
no
doubt
thought
they
had
had
war
enough
and
left
with
the
intention
of
remaining
out
of
the
army
some
came
to
me
and
asked
permission
to
go
saying
that
they
were
tired
of
the
war
and
would
not
be
caught
in
the
ranks
again
and
i
bade
them
go
the
actual
number
of
confederates
at
fort
donelson
can
never
be
given
with
entire
accuracy
the
largest
number
admitted
by
any
writer
on
the
southern
side
is
by
colonel
preston
johnston
he
gives
the
number
at
but
this
must
be
an
underestimate
the
commissary
general
of
prisoners
reported
having
issued
rations
to
fort
donelson
prisoners
at
cairo
as
they
passed
that
point
general
pillow
reported
the
killed
and
wounded
at
but
he
had
less
opportunity
of
knowing
the
actual
numbers
than
the
officers
of
mcclernand
division
for
most
of
the
killed
and
wounded
fell
outside
their
works
in
front
of
that
division
and
were
buried
or
cared
for
by
buckner
after
the
surrender
and
when
pillow
was
a
fugitive
it
is
known
that
floyd
and
pillow
escaped
during
the
night
of
the
taking
with
them
not
less
than
men
forrest
escaped
with
about
and
others
were
leaving
singly
and
in
squads
all
night
it
is
probable
that
the
confederate
force
at
donelson
on
the
of
february
was
in
round
numbers
on
the
day
fort
donelson
fell
i
had
men
to
confront
the
confederate
lines
and
guard
the
road
four
or
five
miles
to
the
left
over
which
all
our
supplies
had
to
be
drawn
on
wagons
during
the
after
the
surrender
additional
reinforcements
arrived
during
the
siege
general
sherman
had
been
sent
to
smithland
at
the
mouth
of
the
cumberland
river
to
forward
reinforcements
and
supplies
to
me
at
that
time
he
was
my
senior
in
rank
and
there
was
no
authority
of
law
to
assign
a
junior
to
command
a
senior
of
the
same
grade
but
every
boat
that
came
up
with
supplies
or
reinforcements
brought
a
note
of
encouragement
from
sherman
asking
me
to
call
upon
him
for
any
assistance
he
could
render
and
saying
that
if
he
could
be
of
service
at
the
front
i
might
send
for
him
and
he
would
waive
rank

general

the
news
of
the
fall
of
fort

caused
great
delight
all
over
the
north
at
the
south
particularly
in
richmond
the
effect
was
correspondingly
depressing
i
was
promptly
promoted
to
the
grade
of
of
volunteers
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
all
three
of
my
division
commanders
were
promoted
to
the
same
grade
and
the
colonels
who
commanded
brigades
were
made
in
the
volunteer
service
my
chief
who
was
in
louis
telegraphed
his
congratulations
to
general
hunter
in
kansas
for
the
services
he
had
rendered
in
securing
the
fall
of
fort
donelson
by
sending
reinforcements
so
rapidly
to
washington
he
telegraphed
that
the
victory
was
due
to
general
smith
promote
him
he
said
and
the
whole
country
will
applaud
on
the
there
was
published
at
louis
a
formal
order
thanking
foote
and
myself
and
the
forces
under
our
command
for
the
victories
on
the
tennessee
and
the
cumberland
i
received
no
other
recognition
whatever
from
general
halleck
but
general
cullum
his
chief
of
staff
who
was
at
cairo
wrote
me
a
warm
congratulatory
letter
on
his
own
behalf
i
approved
of
general
promotion
highly
as
i
did
all
the
promotions
that
were
made
my
opinion
was
and
still
is
that
immediately
after
the
fall
of
fort
donelson
the
way
was
opened
to
the
national
forces
all
over
the
without
much
resistance
if
one
general
who
would
have
taken
the
responsibility
had
been
in
command
of
all
the
troops
west
of
the
alleghanies
he
could
have
marched
to
chattanooga
corinth
memphis
and
vicksburg
with
the
troops
we
then
had
and
as
volunteering
was
going
on
rapidly
over
the
north
there
would
soon
have
been
force
enough
at
all
these
centres
to
operate
offensively
against
any
body
of
the
enemy
that
might
be
found
near
them
rapid
movements
and
the
acquisition
of
rebellious
territory
would
have
promoted
volunteering
so
that
reinforcements
could
have
been
had
as
fast
as
transportation
could
have
been
obtained
to
carry
them
to
their
destination
on
the
other
hand
there
were
tens
of
thousands
of
strong
young
men
still
at
their
homes
in
the
states
who
had
not
gone
into
the
confederate
army
in
february
and
who
had
no
particular
desire
to
go
if
our
lines
had
been
extended
to
protect
their
homes
many
of
them
never
would
have
gone
providence
ruled
differently
time
was
given
the
enemy
to
collect
armies
and
fortify
his
new
positions
and
twice
afterwards
he
came
near
forcing
his
front
up
to
the
ohio
river
i
promptly
informed
the
department
commander
of
our
success
at
fort
donelson
and
that
the
way
was
open
now
to
clarksville
and
nashville
and
that
unless
i
received
orders
to
the
contrary
i
should
take
clarksville
on
the
and
nashville
about
the
of
march
both
these
places
are
on
the
cumberland
river
above
fort
donelson
as
i
heard
nothing
from
headquarters
on
the
subject
general
smith
was
sent
to
clarksville
at
the
time
designated
and
found
the
place
evacuated
the
capture
of
forts
henry
and
donelson
had
broken
the
line
the
enemy
had
taken
from
columbus
to
bowling
green
and
it
was
known
that
he
was
falling
back
from
the
eastern
point
of
this
line
and
that
buell
was
following
or
at
least
advancing
i
should
have
sent
troops
to
nashville
at
the
time
i
sent
to
clarksville
but
my
transportation
was
limited
and
there
were
many
prisoners
to
be
forwarded
north
none
of
the
reinforcements
from
buell
army
arrived
until
the
of
february
then
general
nelson
came
up
with
orders
to
report
to
me
with
two
brigades
he
having
sent
one
brigade
to
cairo
i
knew
general
buell
was
advancing
on
nashville
from
the
north
and
i
was
advised
by
scouts
that
the
rebels
were
leaving
that
place
and
trying
to
get
out
all
the
supplies
they
could
nashville
was
at
that
time
one
of
the
best
provisioned
posts
in
the
south
i
had
no
use
for
reinforcements
now
and
thinking
buell
would
like
to
have
his
troops
again
i
ordered
nelson
to
proceed
to
nashville
without
debarking
at
fort
donelson
i
sent
a
gunboat
also
as
a
convoy
the
cumberland
river
was
very
high
at
the
time
the
railroad
bridge
at
nashville
had
been
burned
and
all
river
craft
had
been
destroyed
or
would
be
before
the
enemy
left
nashville
is
on
the
west
bank
of
the
cumberland
and
buell
was
approaching
from
the
east
i
thought
the
steamers
carrying
nelson
division
would
be
useful
in
ferrying
the
balance
of
buell
forces
across
i
ordered
nelson
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
buell
as
soon
as
possible
and
if
he
found
him
more
than
two
days
off
from
nashville
to
return
below
the
city
and
await
orders
buell
however
had
already
arrived
in
person
at
edgefield
opposite
nashville
and
mitchell
division
of
his
command
reached
there
the
same
day
nelson
immediately
took
possession
of
the
city
after
nelson
had
gone
and
before
i
had
learned
of
buell
arrival
i
sent
word
to
department
headquarters
that
i
should
go
to
nashville
myself
on
the
if
i
received
no
orders
to
the
contrary
hearing
nothing
i
went
as
i
had
informed
my
superior
officer
i
would
do
on
arriving
at
clarksville
i
saw
a
fleet
of
steamers
at
the
shore
the
same
that
had
taken
nelson
division
and
troops
going
aboard
i
landed
and
called
on
the
commanding
officer
general
smith
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
showed
an
order
he
had
just
received
from
buell
in
these
words
nashville
february
general
smith
commanding
forces
clarksville
general
the
landing
of
a
portion
of
our
troops
contrary
to
my
intentions
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
has
compelled
me
to
hold
this
side
at
every
hazard
if
the
enemy
should
assume
the
offensive
and
i
am
assured
by
reliable
persons
that
in
view
of
my
position
such
is
his
intention
my
force
present
is
altogether
inadequate
consisting
of
only
men
i
have
to
request
you
therefore
to
come
forward
with
all
the
available
force
under
your
command
so
important
do
i
consider
the
occasion
that
i
think
it
necessary
to
give
this
communication
all
the
force
of
orders
and
i
send
four
boats
the
diana
woodford
john
rain
and
autocrat
to
bring
you
up
in
five
or
six
days
my
force
will
probably
be
sufficient
to
relieve
you
very
respectfully
your
buell
the
steamers
will
leave
here
at
general
smith
said
this
order
was
nonsense
but
i
told
him
it
was
better
to
obey
it
the
general
replied
of
course
i
must
obey
and
said
his
men
were
embarking
as
fast
as
they
could
i
went
on
up
to
nashville
and
inspected
the
position
taken
by
nelson
troops
i
did
not
see
buell
during
the
day
and
wrote
him
a
note
saying
that
i
had
been
in
nashville
since
early
morning
and
had
hoped
to
meet
him
on
my
return
to
the
boat
we
met
his
troops
were
still
east
of
the
river
and
the
steamers
that
had
carried
nelson
division
up
were
mostly
at
clarksville
to
bring
smith
division
i
said
to
general
buell
my
information
was
that
the
enemy
was
retreating
as
fast
as
possible
general
buell
said
there
was
fighting
going
on
then
only
ten
or
twelve
miles
away
i
said
quite
probably
nashville
contained
valuable
stores
of
arms
ammunition
and
provisions
and
the
enemy
is
probably
trying
to
carry
away
all
he
can
the
fighting
is
doubtless
with
the
who
are
trying
to
protect
the
trains
they
are
getting
away
with
buell
spoke
very
positively
of
the
danger
nashville
was
in
of
an
attack
from
the
enemy
i
said
in
the
absence
of
positive
information
i
believed
my
information
was
correct
he
responded
that
he
knew
well
i
said
i
do
not
know
but
as
i
came
by
clarksville
general
smith
troops
were
embarking
to
join
you
smith
troops
were
returned
the
same
day
the
enemy
were
trying
to
get
away
from
nashville
and
not
to
return
to
it
at
this
time
general
albert
sidney
johnston
commanded
all
the
confederate
troops
west
of
the
alleghany
mountains
with
the
exception
of
those
in
the
extreme
south
on
the
national
side
the
forces
confronting
him
were
divided
into
at
first
three
then
four
separate
departments
johnston
had
greatly
the
advantage
in
having
supreme
command
over
all
troops
that
could
possibly
be
brought
to
bear
upon
one
point
while
the
forces
similarly
situated
on
the
national
side
divided
into
independent
commands
could
not
be
brought
into
harmonious
action
except
by
orders
from
washington
at
the
beginning
of
johnston
troops
east
of
the
mississippi
occupied
a
line
extending
from
columbus
on
his
left
to
mill
springs
on
his
right
as
we
have
seen
columbus
both
banks
of
the
tennessee
river
the
west
bank
of
the
cumberland
and
bowling
green
all
were
strongly
fortified
mill
springs
was
intrenched
the
national
troops
occupied
no
territory
south
of
the
ohio
except
three
small
garrisons
along
its
bank
and
a
force
thrown
out
from
louisville
to
confront
that
at
bowling
green
johnston
strength
was
no
doubt
numerically
inferior
to
that
of
the
national
troops
but
this
was
compensated
for
by
the
advantage
of
being
sole
commander
of
all
the
confederate
forces
at
the
west
and
of
operating
in
a
country
where
his
friends
would
take
care
of
his
rear
without
any
detail
of
soldiers
but
when
general
george
thomas
moved
upon
the
enemy
at
mill
springs
and
totally
routed
him
inflicting
a
loss
of
some
killed
and
wounded
and
forts
henry
and
heiman
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
national
forces
with
their
armaments
and
about
prisoners
those
losses
seemed
to
dishearten
the
confederate
commander
so
much
that
he
immediately
commenced
a
retreat
from
bowling
green
on
nashville
he
reached
this
latter
place
on
the
of
february
while
donelson
was
still
besieged
buell
followed
with
a
portion
of
the
army
of
the
ohio
but
he
had
to
march
and
did
not
reach
the
east
bank
of
the
cumberland
opposite
nashville
until
the
of
the
month
and
then
with
only
one
division
of
his
army
the
bridge
at
nashville
had
been
destroyed
and
all
boats
removed
or
disabled
so
that
a
small
garrison
could
have
held
the
place
against
any
national
troops
that
could
have
been
brought
against
it
within
ten
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
force
from
bowling
green
johnston
seemed
to
lie
quietly
at
nashville
to
await
the
result
at
fort
donelson
on
which
he
had
staked
the
possession
of
most
of
the
territory
embraced
in
the
states
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
it
is
true
the
two
generals
senior
in
rank
at
fort
donelson
were
sending
him
encouraging
dispatches
even
claiming
great
confederate
victories
up
to
the
night
of
the
when
they
must
have
been
preparing
for
their
individual
escape
johnston
made
a
fatal
mistake
in
intrusting
so
important
a
command
to
floyd
who
he
must
have
known
was
no
soldier
even
if
he
possessed
the
elements
of
one
pillow
presence
as
second
was
also
a
mistake
if
these
officers
had
been
forced
upon
him
and
designated
for
that
particular
command
then
he
should
have
left
nashville
with
a
small
garrison
under
a
trusty
officer
and
with
the
remainder
of
his
force
gone
to
donelson
himself
if
he
had
been
captured
the
result
could
not
have
been
worse
than
it
was
johnston
heart
failed
him
upon
the
first
advance
of
national
troops
he
wrote
to
richmond
on
the
of
february
i
think
the
gunboats
of
the
enemy
will
probably
take
fort
donelson
without
the
necessity
of
employing
their
land
force
in
cooperation
after
the
fall
of
that
place
he
abandoned
nashville
and
chattanooga
without
an
effort
to
save
either
and
fell
back
into
northern
mississippi
where
six
weeks
later
he
was
destined
to
end
his
career
from
the
time
of
leaving
cairo
i
was
singularly
unfortunate
in
not
receiving
dispatches
from
general
halleck
the
order
of
the
of
february
directing
me
to
fortify
fort
henry
strongly
particularly
to
the
land
side
and
saying
that
intrenching
tools
had
been
sent
for
that
purpose
reached
me
after
donelson
was
invested
i
received
nothing
direct
which
indicated
that
the
department
commander
knew
we
were
in
possession
of
donelson
i
was
reporting
regularly
to
the
chief
of
staff
who
had
been
sent
to
cairo
soon
after
the
troops
left
there
to
receive
all
reports
from
the
front
and
to
telegraph
the
substance
to
the
louis
headquarters
cairo
was
at
the
southern
end
of
the
telegraph
wire
another
line
was
started
at
once
from
cairo
to
paducah
and
smithland
at
the
mouths
of
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
respectively
my
dispatches
were
all
sent
to
cairo
by
boat
but
many
of
those
addressed
to
me
were
sent
to
the
operator
at
the
end
of
the
advancing
wire
and
he
failed
to
forward
them
this
operator
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
rebel
he
deserted
his
post
after
a
short
time
and
went
south
taking
his
dispatches
with
him
a
telegram
from
general
mcclellan
to
me
of
february
the
day
of
the
surrender
directing
me
to
report
in
full
the
situation
was
not
received
at
my
headquarters
until
the
of
march
on
the
of
march
i
received
orders
dated
march
to
move
my
command
back
to
fort
henry
leaving
only
a
small
garrison
at
donelson
from
fort
henry
expeditions
were
to
be
sent
against
eastport
mississippi
and
paris
tennessee
we
started
from
donelson
on
the
and
the
same
day
i
was
back
on
the
tennessee
river
on
march
i
also
received
the
following
dispatch
from
general
halleck
grant
fort
henry
you
will
place
smith
in
command
of
expedition
and
remain
yourself
at
fort
henry
why
do
you
not
obey
my
orders
to
report
strength
and
positions
of
your
command
halleck
i
was
surprised
this
was
the
first
intimation
i
had
received
that
general
halleck
had
called
for
information
as
to
the
strength
of
my
command
on
the
he
wrote
to
me
again
your
going
to
nashville
without
authority
and
when
your
presence
with
your
troops
was
of
the
utmost
importance
was
a
matter
of
very
serious
complaint
at
washington
so
much
so
that
i
was
advised
to
arrest
you
on
your
return
this
was
the
first
i
knew
of
his
objecting
to
my
going
to
nashville
that
place
was
not
beyond
the
limits
of
my
command
which
it
had
been
expressly
declared
in
orders
were
not
defined
nashville
is
west
of
the
cumberland
river
and
i
had
sent
troops
that
had
reported
to
me
for
duty
to
occupy
the
place
i
turned
over
the
command
as
directed
and
then
replied
to
general
halleck
courteously
but
asked
to
be
relieved
from
further
duty
under
him
later
i
learned
that
general
halleck
had
been
calling
lustily
for
more
troops
promising
that
he
would
do
something
important
if
he
could
only
be
sufficiently
reinforced
mcclellan
asked
him
what
force
he
then
had
halleck
telegraphed
me
to
supply
the
information
so
far
as
my
command
was
concerned
but
i
received
none
of
his
dispatches
at
last
halleck
reported
to
washington
that
he
had
repeatedly
ordered
me
to
give
the
strength
of
my
force
but
could
get
nothing
out
of
me
that
i
had
gone
to
nashville
beyond
the
limits
of
my
command
without
his
authority
and
that
my
army
was
more
demoralized
by
victory
than
the
army
at
bull
run
had
been
by
defeat
general
mcclellan
on
this
information
ordered
that
i
should
be
relieved
from
duty
and
that
an
investigation
should
be
made
into
any
charges
against
me
he
even
authorized
my
arrest
thus
in
less
than
two
weeks
after
the
victory
at
donelson
the
two
leading
generals
in
the
army
were
in
correspondence
as
to
what
disposition
should
be
made
of
me
and
in
less
than
three
weeks
i
was
virtually
in
arrest
and
without
a
command
on
the
of
march
i
was
restored
to
command
and
on
the
halleck
sent
me
a
copy
of
an
order
from
the
war
department
which
stated
that
accounts
of
my
misbehavior
had
reached
washington
and
directed
him
to
investigate
and
report
the
facts
he
forwarded
also
a
copy
of
a
detailed
dispatch
from
himself
to
washington
entirely
exonerating
me
but
he
did
not
inform
me
that
it
was
his
own
reports
that
had
created
all
the
trouble
on
the
contrary
he
wrote
to
me
instead
of
relieving
you
i
wish
you
as
soon
as
your
new
army
is
in
the
field
to
assume
immediate
command
and
lead
it
to
new
victories
in
consequence
i
felt
very
grateful
to
him
and
supposed
it
was
his
interposition
that
had
set
me
right
with
the
government
i
never
knew
the
truth
until
general
badeau
unearthed
the
facts
in
his
researches
for
his
history
of
my
campaigns
general
halleck
unquestionably
deemed
general
smith
a
much
fitter
officer
for
the
command
of
all
the
forces
in
the
military
district
than
i
was
and
to
render
him
available
for
such
command
desired
his
promotion
to
antedate
mine
and
those
of
the
other
division
commanders
it
is
probable
that
the
general
opinion
was
that
smith
long
services
in
the
army
and
distinguished
deeds
rendered
him
the
more
proper
person
for
such
command
indeed
i
was
rather
inclined
to
this
opinion
myself
at
that
time
and
would
have
served
as
faithfully
under
smith
as
he
had
done
under
me
but
this
did
not
justify
the
dispatches
which
general
halleck
sent
to
washington
or
his
subsequent
concealment
of
them
from
me
when
pretending
to
explain
the
action
of
my
superiors
on
receipt
of
the
order
restoring
me
to
command
i
proceeded
to
savannah
on
the
tennessee
to
which
point
my
troops
had
advanced
general
smith
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
was
unhesitating
in
his
denunciation
of
the
treatment
i
had
received
he
was
on
a
sick
bed
at
the
time
from
which
he
never
came
away
alive
his
death
was
a
severe
loss
to
our
western
army
his
personal
courage
was
unquestioned
his
judgment
and
professional
acquirements
were
unsurpassed
and
he
had
the
confidence
of
those
he
commanded
as
well
as
of
those
over
him

at

while
one
division
was
at

on

bank
about

miles
higher
up
and
the

at

the

was
in
force
at

of
the
two
most
important
railroads
in
the

valley
one
connecting
memphis

leading

states
still
another
railroad
connects

with

in

tennessee
if
we
obtained
possession
of
corinth
the
enemy
would
have
no
railroad
for
the
transportation
of
armies
or
supplies
until
that
running
east
from
vicksburg
was
reached
it
was
the
great
strategic
position
at
the
west
between
the
tennessee
and
the
mississippi
rivers
and
between
nashville
and
vicksburg
i
at
once
put
all
the
troops
at

in
motion
for
pittsburg
landing
knowing
that
the
enemy
was
fortifying
at
corinth
and
collecting
an
army
there
under
johnston
it
was
my
expectation
to
march
against
that
army
as
soon
as
buell
who
had
been
ordered
to
reinforce
me
with
the
army
of
the
ohio
should
arrive
and
the
west

only
about
twenty
miles
from
corinth
and
hamburg
landing
four
miles
further
up
the
river
is
a
mile
or
two
nearer
i
had
not
been
in
command
long
before
i
selected
hamburg
as
the
place
to
put
the
army
of
the
ohio
when
it
arrived
the
roads
from
pittsburg
and
hamburg
to
corinth
converge
some
eight
miles
out
this
disposition
of
the
troops
would
have
given
additional
roads
to
march
over
when
the
advance
commenced
within
supporting
distance
of
each
other
before
i
arrived
at
savannah
sherman
who
had
joined
the
army
of
the
tennessee
and
been
placed
in
command
of
a
division
had
made
an
expedition
on
steamers
convoyed
by
gunboats
to
the
neighborhood
of
eastport
thirty
miles
south
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
railroad
east
of
corinth
the
rains
had
been
so
heavy
for
some
time
before
that
the
had
become
impassable
swamps
sherman
debarked
his
troops
and
started
out
to
accomplish
the
object
of
the
expedition
but
the
river
was
rising
so
rapidly
that
the
up
the
small
tributaries
threatened
to
cut
off
the
possibility
of
getting
back
to
the
boats
and
the
expedition
had
to
return
without
reaching
the
railroad
the
guns
had
to
be
hauled
by
hand
through
the
water
to
get
back
to
the
boats
on
the
of
march
the
army
on
the
tennessee
river
consisted
of
five
divisions
commanded
respectively
by
generals
smith
mcclernand
wallace
hurlbut
and
sherman
general
wallace
was
temporarily
in
command
of
smith
division
general
smith
as
i
have
said
being
confined
to
his
bed
reinforcements
were
arriving
daily
and
as
they
came
up
they
were
organized
first
into
brigades
then
into
a
division
and
the
command
given
to
general
prentiss
who
had
been
ordered
to
report
to
me
general
buell
was
on
his
way
from
nashville
with
veterans
on
the
of
march
he
was
at
columbia
tennessee
miles
from
pittsburg
when
all
reinforcements
should
have
arrived
i
expected
to
take
the
initiative
by
marching
on
corinth
and
had
no
expectation
of
needing
fortifications
though
this
subject
was
taken
into
consideration
mcpherson
my
only
military
engineer
was
directed
to
lay
out
a
line
to
intrench
he
did
so
but
reported
that
it
would
have
to
be
made
in
rear
of
the
line
of
encampment
as
it
then
ran
the
new
line
while
it
would
be
nearer
the
river
was
yet
too
far
away
from
the
tennessee
or
even
from
the
creeks
to
be
easily
supplied
with
water
and
in
case
of
attack
these
creeks
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
fact
is
i
regarded
the
campaign
we
were
engaged
in
as
an
offensive
one
and
had
no
idea
that
the
enemy
would
leave
strong
intrenchments
to
take
the
initiative
when
he
knew
he
would
be
attacked
where
he
was
if
he
remained
this
view
however
did
not
prevent
every
precaution
being
taken
and
every
effort
made
to
keep
advised
of
all
movements
of
the
enemy
johnston
cavalry
meanwhile
had
been
well
out
towards
our
front
and
occasional
encounters
occurred
between
it
and
our
outposts
on
the
of
april
this
cavalry
became
bold
and
approached
our
lines
showing
that
an
advance
of
some
kind
was
contemplated
on
the
johnston
left
corinth
in
force
to
attack
my
army
on
the
his
cavalry
dashed
down
and
captured
a
small
picket
guard
of
six
or
seven
men
stationed
some
five
miles
out
from
pittsburg
on
the
corinth
road
colonel
buckland
sent
relief
to
the
guard
at
once
and
soon
followed
in
person
with
an
entire
regiment
and
general
sherman
followed
buckland
taking
the
remainder
of
a
brigade
the
pursuit
was
kept
up
for
some
three
miles
beyond
the
point
where
the
picket
guard
had
been
captured
and
after
nightfall
sherman
returned
to
camp
and
reported
to
me
by
letter
what
had
occurred
at
this
time
a
large
body
of
the
enemy
was
hovering
to
the
west
of
us
along
the
line
of
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
my
apprehension
was
much
greater
for
the
safety
of
crump
landing
than
it
was
for
pittsburg
i
had
no
apprehension
that
the
enemy
could
really
capture
either
place
but
i
feared
it
was
possible
that
he
might
make
a
rapid
dash
upon
crump
and
destroy
our
transports
and
stores
most
of
which
were
kept
at
that
point
and
then
retreat
before
wallace
could
be
reinforced
lew
wallace
position
i
regarded
as
so
well
chosen
that
he
was
not
removed
at
this
time
i
generally
spent
the
day
at
pittsburg
and
returned
to
savannah
in
the
evening
i
was
intending
to
remove
my
headquarters
to
pittsburg
but
buell
was
expected
daily
and
would
come
in
at
savannah
i
remained
at
this
point
therefore
a
few
days
longer
than
i
otherwise
should
have
done
in
order
to
meet
him
on
his
arrival
the
skirmishing
in
our
front
however
had
been
so
continuous
from
about
the
of
april
that
i
did
not
leave
pittsburg
each
night
until
an
hour
when
i
felt
there
would
be
no
further
danger
before
the
morning
on
friday
the
the
day
of
buckland
advance
i
was
very
much
injured
by
my
horse
falling
with
me
and
on
me
while
i
was
trying
to
get
to
the
front
where
firing
had
been
heard
the
night
was
one
of
impenetrable
darkness
with
rain
pouring
down
in
torrents
nothing
was
visible
to
the
eye
except
as
revealed
by
the
frequent
flashes
of
lightning
under
these
circumstances
i
had
to
trust
to
the
horse
without
guidance
to
keep
the
road
i
had
not
gone
far
however
when
i
met
general
wallace
and
colonel
afterwards
general
mcpherson
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
front
they
said
all
was
quiet
so
far
as
the
enemy
was
concerned
on
the
way
back
to
the
boat
my
horse
feet
slipped
from
under
him
and
he
fell
with
my
leg
under
his
body
the
extreme
softness
of
the
ground
from
the
excessive
rains
of
the
few
preceding
days
no
doubt
saved
me
from
a
severe
injury
and
protracted
lameness
as
it
was
my
ankle
was
very
much
injured
so
much
so
that
my
boot
had
to
be
cut
off
for
two
or
three
days
after
i
was
unable
to
walk
except
with
crutches
on
the
general
nelson
with
a
division
of
buell
army
arrived
at
savannah
and
i
ordered
him
to
move
up
the
east
bank
of
the
river
to
be
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
ferried
over
to
crump
landing
or
pittsburg
as
occasion
required
i
had
learned
that
general
buell
himself
would
be
at
savannah
the
next
day
and
desired
to
meet
me
on
his
arrival
affairs
at
pittsburg
landing
had
been
such
for
several
days
that
i
did
not
want
to
be
away
during
the
day
i
determined
therefore
to
take
a
very
early
breakfast
and
ride
out
to
meet
buell
and
thus
save
time
he
had
arrived
on
the
evening
of
the
but
had
not
advised
me
of
the
fact
and
i
was
not
aware
of
it
until
some
time
after
while
i
was
at
breakfast
however
heavy
firing
was
heard
in
the
direction
of
pittsburg
landing
and
i
hastened
there
sending
a
hurried
note
to
buell
informing
him
of
the
reason
why
i
could
not
meet
him
at
savannah
on
the
way
up
the
river
i
directed
the
to
run
in
close
to
crump
landing
so
that
i
could
communicate
with
general
lew
wallace
i
found
him
waiting
on
a
boat
apparently
expecting
to
see
me
and
i
directed
him
to
get
his
troops
in
line
ready
to
execute
any
orders
he
might
receive
he
replied
that
his
troops
were
already
under
arms
and
prepared
to
move
up
to
that
time
i
had
felt
by
no
means
certain
that
crump
landing
might
not
be
the
point
of
attack
on
reaching
the
front
however
about
eight
i
found
that
the
attack
on
pittsburg
was
unmistakable
and
that
nothing
more
than
a
small
guard
to
protect
our
transports
and
stores
was
needed
at
crump
captain
baxter
a
quartermaster
on
my
staff
was
accordingly
directed
to
go
back
and
order
general
wallace
to
march
immediately
to
pittsburg
by
the
road
nearest
the
river
captain
baxter
made
a
memorandum
of
this
order
about
one
not
hearing
from
wallace
and
being
much
in
need
of
reinforcements
i
sent
two
more
of
my
staff
colonel
mcpherson
and
captain
rowley
to
bring
him
up
with
his
division
they
reported
finding
him
marching
towards
purdy
bethel
or
some
point
west
from
the
river
and
farther
from
pittsburg
by
several
miles
than
when
he
started
the
road
from
his
first
position
to
pittsburg
landing
was
direct
and
near
the
river
between
the
two
points
a
bridge
had
been
built
across
snake
creek
by
our
troops
at
which
wallace
command
had
assisted
expressly
to
enable
the
troops
at
the
two
places
to
support
each
other
in
case
of
need
wallace
did
not
arrive
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
first
day
fight
general
wallace
has
since
claimed
that
the
order
delivered
to
him
by
captain
baxter
was
simply
to
join
the
right
of
the
army
and
that
the
road
over
which
he
marched
would
have
taken
him
to
the
road
from
pittsburg
to
purdy
where
it
crosses
owl
creek
on
the
right
of
sherman
but
this
is
not
where
i
had
ordered
him
nor
where
i
wanted
him
to
go
i
never
could
see
and
do
not
now
see
why
any
order
was
necessary
further
than
to
direct
him
to
come
to
pittsburg
landing
without
specifying
by
what
route
his
was
one
of
three
veteran
divisions
that
had
been
in
battle
and
its
absence
was
severely
felt
later
in
the
war
general
wallace
would
not
have
made
the
mistake
that
he
committed
on
the
of
april
i
presume
his
idea
was
that
by
taking
the
route
he
did
he
would
be
able
to
come
around
on
the
flank
or
rear
of
the
enemy
and
thus
perform
an
act
of
heroism
that
would
redound
to
the
credit
of
his
command
as
well
as
to
the
benefit
of
his
country
some
two
or
three
miles
from
pittsburg
landing
was
a
log
called
shiloh
it
stood
on
the
ridge
which
divides
the
waters
of
snake
and
lick
creeks
the
former
emptying
into
the
tennessee
just
north
of
pittsburg
landing
and
the
latter
south
this
point
was
the
key
to
our
position
and
was
held
by
sherman
his
division
was
at
that
time
wholly
raw
no
part
of
it
ever
having
been
in
an
engagement
but
i
thought
this
deficiency
was
more
than
made
up
by
the
superiority
of
the
commander
mcclernand
was
on
sherman
left
with
troops
that
had
been
engaged
at
forts
henry
and
donelson
and
were
therefore
veterans
so
far
as
western
troops
had
become
such
at
that
stage
of
the
war
next
to
mcclernand
came
prentiss
with
a
raw
division
and
on
the
extreme
left
stuart
with
one
brigade
of
sherman
division
hurlbut
was
in
rear
of
prentiss
massed
and
in
reserve
at
the
time
of
the
onset
the
division
of
general
smith
was
on
the
right
also
in
reserve
general
smith
was
still
sick
in
bed
at
savannah
but
within
hearing
of
our
guns
his
services
would
no
doubt
have
been
of
inestimable
value
had
his
health
permitted
his
presence
the
command
of
his
division
devolved
upon
wallace
a
most
estimable
and
able
officer
a
veteran
too
for
he
had
served
a
year
in
the
mexican
war
and
had
been
with
his
command
at
henry
and
donelson
wallace
was
mortally
wounded
in
the
first
day
engagement
and
with
the
change
of
commanders
thus
necessarily
effected
in
the
heat
of
battle
the
efficiency
of
his
division
was
much
weakened
the
position
of
our
troops
made
a
continuous
line
from
lick
creek
on
the
left
to
owl
creek
a
branch
of
snake
creek
on
the
right
facing
nearly
south
and
possibly
a
little
west
the
water
in
all
these
streams
was
very
high
at
the
time
and
contributed
to
protect
our
flanks
the
enemy
was
compelled
therefore
to
attack
directly
in
front
this
he
did
with
great
vigor
inflicting
heavy
losses
on
the
national
side
but
suffering
much
heavier
on
his
own
the
confederate
assaults
were
made
with
such
a
disregard
of
losses
on
their
own
side
that
our
line
of
tents
soon
fell
into
their
hands
the
ground
on
which
the
battle
was
fought
was
undulating
heavily
timbered
with
scattered
clearings
the
woods
giving
some
protection
to
the
troops
on
both
sides
there
was
also
considerable
underbrush
a
number
of
attempts
were
made
by
the
enemy
to
turn
our
right
flank
where
sherman
was
posted
but
every
effort
was
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
but
the
front
attack
was
kept
up
so
vigorously
that
to
prevent
the
success
of
these
attempts
to
get
on
our
flanks
the
national
troops
were
compelled
several
times
to
take
positions
to
the
rear
nearer
pittsburg
landing
when
the
firing
ceased
at
night
the
national
line
was
all
of
a
mile
in
rear
of
the
position
it
had
occupied
in
the
morning
in
one
of
the
backward
moves
on
the
the
division
commanded
by
general
prentiss
did
not
fall
back
with
the
others
this
left
his
flanks
exposed
and
enabled
the
enemy
to
capture
him
with
about
of
his
officers
and
men
general
badeau
gives
four
of
the
as
about
the
time
this
capture
took
place
he
may
be
right
as
to
the
time
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
hour
was
later
general
prentiss
himself
gave
the
hour
as
five
i
was
with
him
as
i
was
with
each
of
the
division
commanders
that
day
several
times
and
my
recollection
is
that
the
last
time
i
was
with
him
was
about
four
when
his
division
was
standing
up
firmly
and
the
general
was
as
cool
as
if
expecting
victory
but
no
matter
whether
it
was
four
or
later
the
story
that
he
and
his
command
were
surprised
and
captured
in
their
camps
is
without
any
foundation
whatever
if
it
had
been
true
as
currently
reported
at
the
time
and
yet
believed
by
thousands
of
people
that
prentiss
and
his
division
had
been
captured
in
their
beds
there
would
not
have
been
an
struggle
with
the
loss
of
thousands
killed
and
wounded
on
the
confederate
side
with
the
single
exception
of
a
few
minutes
after
the
capture
of
prentiss
a
continuous
and
unbroken
line
was
maintained
all
day
from
snake
creek
or
its
tributaries
on
the
right
to
lick
creek
or
the
tennessee
on
the
left
above
pittsburg
there
was
no
hour
during
the
day
when
there
was
not
heavy
firing
and
generally
hard
fighting
at
some
point
on
the
line
but
seldom
at
all
points
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
case
of
southern
dash
against
northern
pluck
and
endurance
three
of
the
five
divisions
engaged
on
sunday
were
entirely
raw
and
many
of
the
men
had
only
received
their
arms
on
the
way
from
their
states
to
the
field
many
of
them
had
arrived
but
a
day
or
two
before
and
were
hardly
able
to
load
their
muskets
according
to
the
manual
their
officers
were
equally
ignorant
of
their
duties
under
these
circumstances
it
is
not
astonishing
that
many
of
the
regiments
broke
at
the
first
fire
in
two
cases
as
i
now
remember
colonels
led
their
regiments
from
the
field
on
first
hearing
the
whistle
of
the
enemy
bullets
in
these
cases
the
colonels
were
constitutional
cowards
unfit
for
any
military
position
but
not
so
the
officers
and
men
led
out
of
danger
by
them
better
troops
never
went
upon
a
than
many
of
these
officers
and
men
afterwards
proved
themselves
to
be
who
fled
panic
stricken
at
the
first
whistle
of
bullets
and
shell
at
shiloh
during
the
whole
of
sunday
i
was
continuously
engaged
in
passing
from
one
part
of
the
field
to
another
giving
directions
to
division
commanders
in
thus
moving
along
the
line
however
i
never
deemed
it
important
to
stay
long
with
sherman
although
his
troops
were
then
under
fire
for
the
first
time
their
commander
by
his
constant
presence
with
them
inspired
a
confidence
in
officers
and
men
that
enabled
them
to
render
services
on
that
bloody
worthy
of
the
best
of
veterans
mcclernand
was
next
to
sherman
and
the
hardest
fighting
was
in
front
of
these
two
divisions
mcclernand
told
me
on
that
day
the
that
he
profited
much
by
having
so
able
a
commander
supporting
him
a
casualty
to
sherman
that
would
have
taken
him
from
the
field
that
day
would
have
been
a
sad
one
for
the
troops
engaged
at
shiloh
and
how
near
we
came
to
this
on
the
sherman
was
shot
twice
once
in
the
hand
once
in
the
shoulder
the
ball
cutting
his
coat
and
making
a
slight
wound
and
a
third
ball
passed
through
his
hat
in
addition
to
this
he
had
several
horses
shot
during
the
day
the
nature
of
this
battle
was
such
that
cavalry
could
not
be
used
in
front
i
therefore
formed
ours
into
line
in
rear
to
stop
stragglers
of
whom
there
were
many
when
there
would
be
enough
of
them
to
make
a
show
and
after
they
had
recovered
from
their
fright
they
would
be
sent
to
reinforce
some
part
of
the
line
which
needed
support
without
regard
to
their
companies
regiments
or
brigades
on
one
occasion
during
the
day
i
rode
back
as
far
as
the
river
and
met
general
buell
who
had
just
arrived
i
do
not
remember
the
hour
but
at
that
time
there
probably
were
as
many
as
four
or
five
thousand
stragglers
lying
under
cover
of
the
river
bluff
most
of
whom
would
have
been
shot
where
they
lay
without
resistance
before
they
would
have
taken
muskets
and
marched
to
the
front
to
protect
themselves
this
meeting
between
general
buell
and
myself
was
on
the
used
to
run
between
the
landing
and
savannah
it
was
brief
and
related
specially
to
his
getting
his
troops
over
the
river
as
we
left
the
boat
together
buell
attention
was
attracted
by
the
men
lying
under
cover
of
the
river
bank
i
saw
him
berating
them
and
trying
to
shame
them
into
joining
their
regiments
he
even
threatened
them
with
shells
from
the
gunboats
near
by
but
it
was
all
to
no
effect
most
of
these
men
afterward
proved
themselves
as
gallant
as
any
of
those
who
saved
the
battle
from
which
they
had
deserted
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
sight
impressed
general
buell
with
the
idea
that
a
line
of
retreat
would
be
a
good
thing
just
then
if
he
had
come
in
by
the
front
instead
of
through
the
stragglers
in
the
rear
he
would
have
thought
and
felt
differently
could
he
have
come
through
the
confederate
rear
he
would
have
witnessed
there
a
scene
similar
to
that
at
our
own
the
distant
rear
of
an
army
engaged
in
battle
is
not
the
best
place
from
which
to
judge
correctly
what
is
going
on
in
front
later
in
the
war
while
occupying
the
country
between
the
tennessee
and
the
mississippi
i
learned
that
the
panic
in
the
confederate
lines
had
not
differed
much
from
that
within
our
own
some
of
the
country
people
estimated
the
stragglers
from
johnston
army
as
high
as
of
course
this
was
an
exaggeration
the
situation
at
the
close
of
sunday
was
as
follows
along
the
top
of
the
bluff
just
south
of
the
which
stood
at
pittsburg
landing
colonel
webster
of
my
staff
had
arranged
twenty
or
more
pieces
of
artillery
facing
south
or
up
the
river
this
line
of
artillery
was
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
overlooking
a
deep
ravine
opening
into
the
tennessee
hurlbut
with
his
division
intact
was
on
the
right
of
this
artillery
extending
west
and
possibly
a
little
north
mcclernand
came
next
in
the
general
line
looking
more
to
the
west
his
division
was
complete
in
its
organization
and
ready
for
any
duty
sherman
came
next
his
right
extending
to
snake
creek
his
command
like
the
other
two
was
complete
in
its
organization
and
ready
like
its
chief
for
any
service
it
might
be
called
upon
to
render
all
three
divisions
were
as
a
matter
of
course
more
or
less
shattered
and
depleted
in
numbers
from
the
terrible
battle
of
the
day
the
division
of
wallace
as
much
from
the
disorder
arising
from
changes
of
division
and
brigade
commanders
under
heavy
fire
as
from
any
other
cause
had
lost
its
organization
and
did
not
occupy
a
place
in
the
line
as
a
division
prentiss
command
was
gone
as
a
division
many
of
its
members
having
been
killed
wounded
or
captured
but
it
had
rendered
valiant
services
before
its
final
dispersal
and
had
contributed
a
good
share
to
the
defence
of
shiloh
the
right
of
my
line
rested
near
the
bank
of
snake
creek
a
short
distance
above
the
bridge
which
had
been
built
by
the
troops
for
the
purpose
of
connecting
crump
landing
and
pittsburg
landing
sherman
had
posted
some
troops
in
a
and
which
overlooked
both
the
bridge
over
which
wallace
was
expected
and
the
creek
above
that
point
in
this
last
position
sherman
was
frequently
attacked
before
night
but
held
the
point
until
he
voluntarily
abandoned
it
to
advance
in
order
to
make
room
for
lew
wallace
who
came
up
after
dark
there
was
as
i
have
said
a
deep
ravine
in
front
of
our
left
the
tennessee
river
was
very
high
and
there
was
water
to
a
considerable
depth
in
the
ravine
here
the
enemy
made
a
last
desperate
effort
to
turn
our
flank
but
was
repelled
the
gunboats
tyler
and
lexington
gwin
and
shirk
commanding
with
the
artillery
under
webster
aided
the
army
and
effectually
checked
their
further
progress
before
any
of
buell
troops
had
reached
the
west
bank
of
the
tennessee
firing
had
almost
entirely
ceased
anything
like
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
advance
had
absolutely
ceased
there
was
some
artillery
firing
from
an
unseen
enemy
some
of
his
shells
passing
beyond
us
but
i
do
not
remember
that
there
was
the
whistle
of
a
single
heard
as
his
troops
arrived
in
the
dusk
general
buell
marched
several
of
his
regiments
part
way
down
the
face
of
the
hill
where
they
fired
briskly
for
some
minutes
but
i
do
not
think
a
single
man
engaged
in
this
firing
received
an
injury
the
attack
had
spent
its
force
general
lew
wallace
with
effective
men
arrived
after
firing
had
ceased
for
the
day
and
was
placed
on
the
right
thus
night
came
wallace
came
and
the
advance
of
nelson
division
came
but
none
unless
night
in
time
to
be
of
material
service
to
the
gallant
men
who
saved
shiloh
on
that
first
day
against
large
odds
buell
loss
on
the
of
april
was
two
men
killed
and
one
wounded
all
members
of
the
indiana
infantry
the
army
of
the
tennessee
lost
on
that
day
at
least
men
the
presence
of
two
or
three
regiments
of
buell
army
on
the
west
bank
before
firing
ceased
had
not
the
slightest
effect
in
preventing
the
capture
of
pittsburg
landing
so
confident
was
i
before
firing
had
ceased
on
the
that
the
next
day
would
bring
victory
to
our
arms
if
we
could
only
take
the
initiative
that
i
visited
each
division
commander
in
person
before
any
reinforcements
had
reached
the
field
i
directed
them
to
throw
out
heavy
lines
of
skirmishers
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
they
could
see
and
push
them
forward
until
they
found
the
enemy
following
with
their
entire
divisions
in
supporting
distance
and
to
engage
the
enemy
as
soon
as
found
to
sherman
i
told
the
story
of
the
assault
at
fort
donelson
and
said
that
the
same
tactics
would
win
at
shiloh
victory
was
assured
when
wallace
arrived
even
if
there
had
been
no
other
support
i
was
glad
however
to
see
the
reinforcements
of
buell
and
credit
them
with
doing
all
there
was
for
them
to
do
during
the
night
of
the
the
remainder
of
nelson
division
army
crossed
the
river
and
were
ready
to
advance
in
the
morning
forming
the
left
wing
two
other
divisions
crittenden
and
mccook
came
up
the
river
from
savannah
in
the
transports
and
were
on
the
west
bank
early
on
the
buell
commanded
them
in
person
my
command
was
thus
nearly
doubled
in
numbers
and
efficiency
during
the
night
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
our
troops
were
exposed
to
the
storm
without
shelter
i
made
my
headquarters
under
a
tree
a
few
hundred
yards
back
from
the
river
bank
my
ankle
was
so
much
swollen
from
the
fall
of
my
horse
the
friday
night
preceding
and
the
bruise
was
so
painful
that
i
could
get
no
rest
the
drenching
rain
would
have
precluded
the
possibility
of
sleep
without
this
additional
cause
some
time
after
midnight
growing
restive
under
the
storm
and
the
continuous
pain
i
moved
back
to
the
under
the
bank
this
had
been
taken
as
a
hospital
and
all
night
wounded
men
were
being
brought
in
their
wounds
dressed
a
leg
or
an
arm
amputated
as
the
case
might
require
and
everything
being
done
to
save
life
or
alleviate
suffering
the
sight
was
more
unendurable
than
encountering
the
enemy
fire
and
i
returned
to
my
tree
in
the
rain
the
advance
on
the
morning
of
the
developed
the
enemy
in
the
camps
occupied
by
our
troops
before
the
battle
began
more
than
a
mile
back
from
the
most
advanced
position
of
the
confederates
on
the
day
before
it
is
known
now
that
they
had
not
yet
learned
of
the
arrival
of
command
possibly
they
fell
back
so
far
to
get
the
shelter
of
our
tents
during
the
rain
and
also
to
get
away
from
the
shells
that
were
dropped
upon
them
by
the
gunboats
every
fifteen
minutes
during
the
night
the
position
of
the
union
troops
on
the
morning
of
the
was
as
follows
general
lew
wallace
on
the
right
sherman
on
his
left
then
mcclernand
and
then
hurlbut
nelson
of
buell
army
was
on
our
extreme
left
next
to
the
river
crittenden
was
next
in
line
after
nelson
and
on
his
right
mccook
followed
and
formed
the
extreme
right
of
buell
command
my
old
command
thus
formed
the
right
wing
while
the
troops
directly
under
buell
constituted
the
left
wing
of
the
army
these
relative
positions
were
retained
during
the
entire
day
or
until
the
enemy
was
driven
from
the
field
in
a
very
short
time
the
battle
became
general
all
along
the
line
this
day
everything
was
favorable
to
the
union
side
we
had
now
become
the
attacking
party
the
enemy
was
driven
back
all
day
as
we
had
been
the
day
before
until
finally
he
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
the
last
point
held
by
him
was
near
the
road
leading
from
the
landing
to
corinth
on
the
left
of
sherman
and
right
of
mcclernand
about
three
being
near
that
point
and
seeing
that
the
enemy
was
giving
way
everywhere
else
i
gathered
up
a
couple
of
regiments
or
parts
of
regiments
from
troops
near
by
formed
them
in
line
of
battle
and
marched
them
forward
going
in
front
myself
to
prevent
premature
or
firing
at
this
point
there
was
a
clearing
between
us
and
the
enemy
favorable
for
charging
although
exposed
i
knew
the
enemy
were
ready
to
break
and
only
wanted
a
little
encouragement
from
us
to
go
quickly
and
join
their
friends
who
had
started
earlier
after
marching
to
within
i
stopped
and
let
the
troops
pass
the
command
charge
was
given
and
was
executed
with
loud
cheers
and
with
a
run
when
the
last
of
the
enemy
broke

remarks
on
shiloh
during
this
second
day
of
the
battle
i
had
been
moving
from
right
to
left
and
back
to
see
for
myself
the
progress
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
while
riding
with
colonel
mcpherson
and
major
hawkins
then
my
chief
commissary
we
got
beyond
the
left
of
our
troops
we
were
moving
along
the
northern
edge
of
a
clearing
very
leisurely
toward
the
river
above
the
landing
there
did
not
appear
to
be
an
enemy
to
our
right
until
suddenly
a
battery
with
musketry
opened
upon
us
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
the
shells
and
balls
whistled
about
our
ears
very
fast
for
about
a
minute
i
do
not
think
it
took
us
longer
than
that
to
get
out
of
range
and
out
of
sight
in
the
sudden
start
we
made
major
hawkins
lost
his
hat
he
did
not
stop
to
pick
it
up
when
we
arrived
at
a
perfectly
safe
position
we
halted
to
take
an
account
of
damages
mcpherson
horse
was
panting
as
if
ready
to
drop
on
examination
it
was
found
that
a
ball
had
struck
him
forward
of
the
flank
just
back
of
the
saddle
and
had
gone
entirely
through
in
a
few
minutes
the
poor
beast
dropped
dead
he
had
given
no
sign
of
injury
until
we
came
to
a
stop
a
ball
had
struck
the
metal
scabbard
of
my
sword
just
below
the
hilt
and
broken
it
nearly
off
before
the
battle
was
over
it
had
broken
off
entirely
there
were
three
of
us
one
had
lost
a
horse
killed
one
a
hat
and
one
a
all
were
thankful
that
it
was
no
worse
after
the
rain
of
the
night
before
and
the
frequent
and
heavy
rains
for
some
days
previous
the
roads
were
almost
impassable
the
enemy
carrying
his
artillery
and
supply
trains
over
them
in
his
retreat
made
them
still
worse
for
troops
following
i
wanted
to
pursue
but
had
not
the
heart
to
order
the
men
who
had
fought
desperately
for
two
days
lying
in
the
mud
and
rain
whenever
not
fighting
and
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
positively
order
buell
or
any
part
of
his
command
to
pursue
although
the
senior
in
rank
at
the
time
i
had
been
so
only
a
few
weeks
buell
was
and
had
been
for
some
time
past
a
department
commander
while
i
commanded
only
a
district
i
did
not
meet
buell
in
person
until
too
late
to
get
troops
ready
and
pursue
with
effect
but
had
i
seen
him
at
the
moment
of
the
last
charge
i
should
have
at
least
requested
him
to
follow
i
rode
forward
several
miles
the
day
after
the
battle
and
found
that
the
enemy
had
dropped
much
if
not
all
of
their
provisions
some
ammunition
and
the
extra
wheels
of
their
caissons
lightening
their
loads
to
enable
them
to
get
off
their
guns
about
five
miles
out
we
found
their
field
hospital
abandoned
an
immediate
pursuit
must
have
resulted
in
the
capture
of
a
considerable
number
of
prisoners
and
probably
some
guns
shiloh
was
the
severest
battle
fought
at
the
west
during
the
war
and
but
few
in
the
east
equalled
it
for
hard
determined
fighting
i
saw
an
open
field
in
our
possession
on
the
second
day
over
which
the
confederates
had
made
repeated
charges
the
day
before
so
covered
with
dead
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
walk
across
the
clearing
in
any
direction
stepping
on
dead
bodies
without
a
foot
touching
the
ground
on
our
side
national
and
confederate
troops
were
mingled
together
in
about
equal
proportions
but
on
the
remainder
of
the
field
nearly
all
were
confederates
on
one
part
which
had
evidently
not
been
ploughed
for
several
years
probably
because
the
land
was
poor
bushes
had
grown
up
some
to
the
height
of
eight
or
ten
feet
there
was
not
one
of
these
left
standing
unpierced
by
bullets
the
smaller
ones
were
all
cut
down
contrary
to
all
my
experience
up
to
that
time
and
to
the
experience
of
the
army
i
was
then
commanding
we
were
on
the
defensive
we
were
without
intrenchments
or
defensive
advantages
of
any
sort
and
more
than
half
the
army
engaged
the
first
day
was
without
experience
or
even
drill
as
soldiers
the
officers
with
them
except
the
division
commanders
and
possibly
two
or
three
of
the
brigade
commanders
were
equally
inexperienced
in
war
the
result
was
a
union
victory
that
gave
the
men
who
achieved
it
great
confidence
in
themselves
ever
after
the
enemy
fought
bravely
but
they
had
started
out
to
defeat
and
destroy
an
army
and
capture
a
position
they
failed
in
both
with
very
heavy
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
and
must
have
gone
back
discouraged
and
convinced
that
the
yankee
was
not
an
enemy
to
be
despised
after
the
battle
i
gave
verbal
instructions
to
division
commanders
to
let
the
regiments
send
out
parties
to
bury
their
own
dead
and
to
detail
parties
under
commissioned
officers
from
each
division
to
bury
the
confederate
dead
in
their
respective
fronts
and
to
report
the
numbers
so
buried
the
latter
part
of
these
instructions
was
not
carried
out
by
all
but
they
were
by
those
sent
from
sherman
division
and
by
some
of
the
parties
sent
out
by
mcclernand
the
heaviest
loss
sustained
by
the
enemy
was
in
front
of
these
two
divisions
the
criticism
has
often
been
made
that
the
union
troops
should
have
been
intrenched
at
shiloh
up
to
that
time
the
pick
and
spade
had
been
but
little
resorted
to
at
the
west
i
had
however
taken
this
subject
under
consideration
soon
after
command
in
the
field
and
as
already
stated
my
only
military
engineer
reported
unfavorably
besides
this
the
troops
with
me
officers
and
men
needed
discipline
and
drill
more
than
they
did
experience
with
the
pick
shovel
and
axe
reinforcements
were
arriving
almost
daily
composed
of
troops
that
had
been
hastily
thrown
together
into
companies
and
regiments
fragments
of
incomplete
organizations
the
men
and
officers
strangers
to
each
other
under
all
these
circumstances
i
concluded
that
drill
and
discipline
were
worth
more
to
our
men
than
fortifications
general
buell
was
a
brave
intelligent
officer
with
as
much
professional
pride
and
ambition
of
a
commendable
sort
as
i
ever
knew
i
had
been
two
years
at
west
point
with
him
and
had
served
with
him
afterwards
in
garrison
and
in
the
mexican
war
several
years
more
he
was
not
given
in
early
life
or
in
mature
years
to
forming
intimate
acquaintances
he
was
studious
by
habit
and
commanded
the
confidence
and
respect
of
all
who
knew
him
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
perhaps
did
not
distinguish
sufficiently
between
the
volunteer
who
enlisted
for
the
war
and
the
soldier
who
serves
in
time
of
peace
one
system
embraced
men
who
risked
life
for
a
principle
and
often
men
of
social
standing
competence
or
wealth
and
independence
of
character
the
other
includes
as
a
rule
only
men
who
could
not
do
as
well
in
any
other
occupation
general
buell
became
an
object
of
harsh
criticism
later
some
going
so
far
as
to
challenge
his
loyalty
no
one
who
knew
him
ever
believed
him
capable
of
a
dishonorable
act
and
nothing
could
be
more
dishonorable
than
to
accept
high
rank
and
command
in
war
and
then
betray
the
trust
when
i
came
into
command
of
the
army
in
i
requested
the
secretary
of
war
to
restore
general
buell
to
duty
after
the
war
during
the
summer
of
i
travelled
considerably
through
the
north
and
was
everywhere
met
by
large
numbers
of
people
every
one
had
his
opinion
about
the
manner
in
which
the
war
had
been
conducted
who
among
the
generals
had
failed
how
and
why
correspondents
of
the
press
were
ever
on
hand
to
hear
every
word
dropped
and
were
not
always
disposed
to
report
correctly
what
did
not
confirm
their
preconceived
notions
either
about
the
conduct
of
the
war
or
the
individuals
concerned
in
it
the
opportunity
frequently
occurred
for
me
to
defend
general
buell
against
what
i
believed
to
be
most
unjust
charges
on
one
occasion
a
correspondent
put
in
my
mouth
the
very
charge
i
had
so
often
refuted
of
disloyalty
this
brought
from
general
buell
a
very
severe
retort
which
i
saw
in
the
new
york
world
some
time
before
i
received
the
letter
itself
i
could
very
well
understand
his
grievance
at
seeing
untrue
and
disgraceful
charges
apparently
sustained
by
an
officer
who
at
the
time
was
at
the
head
of
the
army
i
replied
to
him
but
not
through
the
press
i
kept
no
copy
of
my
letter
nor
did
i
ever
see
it
in
print
neither
did
i
receive
an
answer
general
albert
sidney
johnston
who
commanded
the
confederate
forces
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
was
disabled
by
a
wound
on
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
this
wound
as
i
understood
afterwards
was
not
necessarily
fatal
or
even
dangerous
but
he
was
a
man
who
would
not
abandon
what
he
deemed
an
important
trust
in
the
face
of
danger
and
consequently
continued
in
the
saddle
commanding
until
so
exhausted
by
the
loss
of
blood
that
he
had
to
be
taken
from
his
horse
and
soon
after
died
the
news
was
not
long
in
reaching
our
side
and
i
suppose
was
quite
an
encouragement
to
the
national
soldiers
i
had
known
johnston
slightly
in
the
mexican
war
and
later
as
an
officer
in
the
regular
army
he
was
a
man
of
high
character
and
ability
his
contemporaries
at
west
point
and
officers
generally
who
came
to
know
him
personally
later
and
who
remained
on
our
side
expected
him
to
prove
the
most
formidable
man
to
meet
that
the
confederacy
would
produce
i
once
wrote
that
nothing
occurred
in
his
brief
command
of
an
army
to
prove
or
disprove
the
high
estimate
that
had
been
placed
upon
his
military
ability
but
after
studying
the
orders
and
dispatches
of
johnston
i
am
compelled
to
materially
modify
my
views
of
that
qualifications
as
a
soldier
my
judgment
now
is
that
he
was
vacillating
and
undecided
in
his
actions
all
the
disasters
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
were
so
discouraging
to
the
authorities
in
richmond
that
jefferson
davis
wrote
an
unofficial
letter
to
johnston
expressing
his
own
anxiety
and
that
of
the
public
and
saying
that
he
had
made
such
defence
as
was
dictated
by
long
friendship
but
that
in
the
absence
of
a
report
he
needed
facts
the
letter
was
not
a
reprimand
in
direct
terms
but
it
was
evidently
as
much
felt
as
though
it
had
been
one
general
johnston
raised
another
army
as
rapidly
as
he
could
and
fortified
or
strongly
intrenched
at
corinth
he
knew
the
national
troops
were
preparing
to
attack
him
in
his
chosen
position
but
he
had
evidently
become
so
disturbed
at
the
results
of
his
operations
that
he
resolved
to
strike
out
in
an
offensive
campaign
which
would
restore
all
that
was
lost
and
if
successful
accomplish
still
more
we
have
the
authority
of
his
son
and
biographer
for
saying
that
his
plan
was
to
attack
the
forces
at
shiloh
and
crush
them
then
to
cross
the
tennessee
and
destroy
the
army
of
buell
and
push
the
war
across
the
ohio
river
the
design
was
a
bold
one
but
we
have
the
same
authority
for
saying
that
in
the
execution
johnston
showed
vacillation
and
indecision
he
left
corinth
on
the
of
april
and
was
not
ready
to
attack
until
the
the
distance
his
army
had
to
march
was
less
than
twenty
miles
beauregard
his
second
in
command
was
opposed
to
the
attack
for
two
reasons
first
he
thought
if
let
alone
the
national
troops
would
attack
the
confederates
in
their
intrenchments
second
we
were
in
ground
of
our
own
choosing
and
would
necessarily
be
intrenched
johnston
not
only
listened
to
the
objection
of
beauregard
to
an
attack
but
held
a
council
of
war
on
the
subject
on
the
morning
of
the
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
was
in
consultation
with
some
of
his
generals
on
the
same
subject
and
still
again
on
the
morning
of
the
during
this
last
consultation
and
before
a
decision
had
been
reached
the
battle
began
by
the
national
troops
opening
fire
on
the
enemy
this
seemed
to
settle
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
to
be
any
battle
of
shiloh
it
also
seems
to
me
to
settle
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
surprise
i
do
not
question
the
personal
courage
of
general
johnston
or
his
ability
but
he
did
not
win
the
distinction
predicted
for
him
by
many
of
his
friends
he
did
prove
that
as
a
general
he
was
general
beauregard
was
next
in
rank
to
johnston
and
succeeded
to
the
command
which
he
retained
to
the
close
of
the
battle
and
during
the
subsequent
retreat
on
corinth
as
well
as
in
the
siege
of
that
place
his
tactics
have
been
severely
criticised
by
confederate
writers
but
i
do
not
believe
his
fallen
chief
could
have
done
any
better
under
the
circumstances
some
of
these
critics
claim
that
shiloh
was
won
when
johnston
fell
and
that
if
he
had
not
fallen
the
army
under
me
would
have
been
annihilated
or
captured
ifs
defeated
the
confederates
at
shiloh
there
is
little
doubt
that
we
would
have
been
disgracefully
beaten
if
all
the
shells
and
bullets
fired
by
us
had
passed
harmlessly
over
the
enemy
and
if
all
of
theirs
had
taken
effect
commanding
generals
are
liable
to
be
killed
during
engagements
and
the
fact
that
when
he
was
shot
johnston
was
leading
a
brigade
to
induce
it
to
make
a
charge
which
had
been
repeatedly
ordered
is
evidence
that
there
was
neither
the
universal
demoralization
on
our
side
nor
the
unbounded
confidence
on
theirs
which
has
been
claimed
there
was
in
fact
no
hour
during
the
day
when
i
doubted
the
eventual
defeat
of
the
enemy
although
i
was
disappointed
that
reinforcements
so
near
at
hand
did
not
arrive
at
an
earlier
hour
the
description
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
given
by
colonel
wm
preston
johnston
is
very
graphic
and
well
told
the
reader
will
imagine
that
he
can
see
each
blow
struck
a
demoralized
and
broken
mob
of
union
soldiers
each
blow
sending
the
enemy
more
demoralized
than
ever
towards
the
tennessee
river
which
was
a
little
more
than
two
miles
away
at
the
beginning
of
the
onset
if
the
reader
does
not
stop
to
inquire
why
with
such
confederate
success
for
more
than
twelve
hours
of
hard
fighting
the
national
troops
were
not
all
killed
captured
or
driven
into
the
river
he
will
regard
the
pen
picture
as
perfect
but
i
witnessed
the
fight
from
the
national
side
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
night
closed
the
contest
i
see
but
little
in
the
description
that
i
can
recognize
the
confederate
troops
fought
well
and
deserve
commendation
enough
for
their
bravery
and
endurance
on
the
of
april
without
detracting
from
their
antagonists
or
claiming
anything
more
than
their
just
dues
the
reports
of
the
enemy
show
that
their
condition
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
was
deplorable
their
losses
in
killed
and
wounded
had
been
very
heavy
and
their
stragglers
had
been
quite
as
numerous
as
on
the
national
side
with
the
difference
that
those
of
the
enemy
left
the
field
entirely
and
were
not
brought
back
to
their
respective
commands
for
many
days
on
the
union
side
but
few
of
the
stragglers
fell
back
further
than
the
landing
on
the
river
and
many
of
these
were
in
line
for
duty
on
the
second
day
the
admissions
of
the
highest
confederate
officers
engaged
at
shiloh
make
the
claim
of
a
victory
for
them
absurd
the
victory
was
not
to
either
party
until
the
battle
was
over
it
was
then
a
union
victory
in
which
the
armies
of
the
tennessee
and
the
ohio
both
participated
but
the
army
of
the
tennessee
fought
the
entire
rebel
army
on
the
and
held
it
at
bay
until
near
night
and
night
alone
closed
the
conflict
and
not
the
three
regiments
of
division
the
confederates
fought
with
courage
at
shiloh
but
the
particular
skill
claimed
i
could
not
and
still
can
not
see
though
there
is
nothing
to
criticise
except
the
claims
put
forward
for
it
since
but
the
confederate
claimants
for
superiority
in
strategy
superiority
in
generalship
and
superiority
in
dash
and
prowess
are
not
so
unjust
to
the
union
troops
engaged
at
shiloh
as
are
many
northern
writers
the
troops
on
both
sides
were
american
and
united
they
need
not
fear
any
foreign
foe
it
is
possible
that
the
southern
man
started
in
with
a
little
more
dash
than
his
northern
brother
but
he
was
correspondingly
less
enduring
the
endeavor
of
the
enemy
on
the
first
day
was
simply
to
hurl
their
men
against
ours
first
at
one
point
then
at
another
sometimes
at
several
points
at
once
this
they
did
with
daring
and
energy
until
at
night
the
rebel
troops
were
worn
out
our
effort
during
the
same
time
was
to
be
prepared
to
resist
assaults
wherever
made
the
object
of
the
confederates
on
the
second
day
was
to
get
away
with
as
much
of
their
army
and
material
as
possible
ours
then
was
to
drive
them
from
our
front
and
to
capture
or
destroy
as
great
a
part
as
possible
of
their
men
and
material
we
were
successful
in
driving
them
back
but
not
so
successful
in
captures
as
if
farther
pursuit
could
have
been
made
as
it
was
we
captured
or
recaptured
on
the
second
day
about
as
much
artillery
as
we
lost
on
the
first
and
leaving
out
the
one
great
capture
of
prentiss
we
took
more
prisoners
on
monday
than
the
enemy
gained
from
us
on
sunday

probably

everybody
who

in

excluding

they
had
fired

was
not

when
we
had
more

but
not
in

wounded
and
missing
of
these

in

army

a
total
loss
of
of
whom
were
killed

and
missing
this
estimate
must
be
incorrect
we
buried
by
actual
count
more
of
the
enemy
dead
in
front
of
the
divisions
of
mcclernand
and
sherman
alone
than
here
reported
and
was
the
estimate
of
the
burial
parties
of
the
whole
field
beauregard
reports
the
confederate
force
on
the
at
over
and
their
total
loss
during
the
two
days
at
and
at
the
same
time
declares
that
he
could
put
only
men
in
battle
on
the
morning
of
the
the
navy
gave
a
hearty
support
to
the
army
at
shiloh
as
indeed
it
always
did
both
before
and
subsequently
when
i
was
in
command
the
nature
of
the
ground
was
such
however
that
on
this
occasion
it
could
do
nothing
in
aid
of
the
troops
until
sundown
on
the
first
day
the
country
was
broken
and
heavily
timbered
cutting
off
all
view
of
the
battle
from
the
river
so
that
friends
would
be
as
much
in
danger
from
fire
from
the
gunboats
as
the
foe
but
about
sundown
when
the
national
troops
were
back
in
their
last
position
the
right
of
the
enemy
was
near
the
river
and
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
two
which
was
delivered
with
vigor
and
effect
after
nightfall
when
firing
had
entirely
ceased
on
land
the
commander
of
the
fleet
informed
himself
approximately
of
the
position
of
our
troops
and
suggested
the
idea
of
dropping
a
shell
within
the
lines
of
the
enemy
every
fifteen
minutes
during
the
night
this
was
done
with
effect
as
is
proved
by
the
confederate
reports
up
to
the
battle
of
shiloh
i
as
well
as
thousands
of
other
citizens
believed
that
the
rebellion
against
the
government
would
collapse
suddenly
and
soon
if
a
decisive
victory
could
be
gained
over
any
of
its
armies
donelson
and
henry
were
such
victories
an
army
of
more
than
men
was
captured
or
destroyed
bowling
green
columbus
and
hickman
kentucky
fell
in
consequence
and
clarksville
and
nashville
tennessee
the
last
two
with
an
immense
amount
of
stores
also
fell
into
our
hands
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
from
their
mouths
to
the
head
of
navigation
were
secured
but
when
confederate
armies
were
collected
which
not
only
attempted
to
hold
a
line
farther
south
from
memphis
to
chattanooga
knoxville
and
on
to
the
atlantic
but
assumed
the
offensive
and
made
such
a
gallant
effort
to
regain
what
had
been
lost
then
indeed
i
gave
up
all
idea
of
saving
the
union
except
by
complete
conquest
up
to
that
time
it
had
been
the
policy
of
our
army
certainly
of
that
portion
commanded
by
me
to
protect
the
property
of
the
citizens
whose
territory
was
invaded
without
regard
to
their
sentiments
whether
union
or
secession
after
this
however
i
regarded
it
as
humane
to
both
sides
to
protect
the
persons
of
those
found
at
their
homes
but
to
consume
everything
that
could
be
used
to
support
or
supply
armies
protection
was
still
continued
over
such
supplies
as
were
within
lines
held
by
us
and
which
we
expected
to
continue
to
hold
but
such
supplies
within
the
reach
of
confederate
armies
i
regarded
as
much
contraband
as
arms
or
ordnance
stores
their
destruction
was
accomplished
without
bloodshed
and
tended
to
the
same
result
as
the
destruction
of
armies
i
continued
this
policy
to
the
close
of
the
war
promiscuous
pillaging
however
was
discouraged
and
punished
instructions
were
always
given
to
take
provisions
and
forage
under
the
direction
of
commissioned
officers
who
should
give
receipts
to
owners
if
at
home
and
turn
the
property
over
to
officers
of
the
quartermaster
or
commissary
departments
to
be
issued
as
if
furnished
from
our
northern
depots
but
much
was
destroyed
without
receipts
to
owners
when
it
could
not
be
brought
within
our
lines
and
would
otherwise
have
gone
to
the
support
of
secession
and
rebellion
this
policy
i
believe
exercised
a
material
influence
in
hastening
the
end
the
battle
of
shiloh
or
pittsburg
landing
has
been
perhaps
less
understood
or
to
state
the
case
more
accurately
more
persistently
misunderstood
than
any
other
engagement
between
national
and
confederate
troops
during
the
entire
rebellion
correct
reports
of
the
battle
have
been
published
notably
by
sherman
badeau
and
in
a
speech
before
a
meeting
of
veterans
by
general
prentiss
but
all
of
these
appeared
long
subsequent
to
the
close
of
the
rebellion
and
after
public
opinion
had
been
most
erroneously
formed
i
myself
made
no
report
to
general
halleck
further
than
was
contained
in
a
letter
written
immediately
after
the
battle
informing
him
that
an
engagement
had
been
fought
and
announcing
the
result
a
few
days
afterwards
general
halleck
moved
his
headquarters
to
pittsburg
landing
and
assumed
command
of
the
troops
in
the
field
although
next
to
him
in
rank
and
nominally
in
command
of
my
old
district
and
army
i
was
ignored
as
much
as
if
i
had
been
at
the
most
distant
point
of
territory
within
my
jurisdiction
and
although
i
was
in
command
of
all
the
troops
engaged
at
shiloh
i
was
not
permitted
to
see
one
of
the
reports
of
general
buell
or
his
subordinates
in
that
battle
until
they
were
published
by
the
war
department
long
after
the
event
for
this
reason
i
never
made
a
full
official
report
of
this
engagement

now
three

the

of
the
ohio
buell
commanding
the
army
of
the
mississippi
pope
commanding
and
the
army
of

the
combined
force
into
the
right
wing
reserve
centre
and
left
wing
george
thomas
who
had
been
in
buell
army
was
transferred
with
his
division
to
the
army
of
the
tennessee
and
given
command
of
the
right
wing
composed
of
all
of
that
army
except
mcclernand
and

mcclernand
was
assigned
to
the

composed
of
his

buell
commanded
the

the
army
of

the
left

the
army
of

i
was
named
second
in
command
of
the
whole
and
was
also
supposed
to
be
in
command
of
the
right
wing
and
reserve
orders
were
given
to
all
the
commanders
engaged
at
shiloh
to
send
in
their
reports
without
delay
to
department
headquarters
those
from
officers
of
the
army
of
the
tennessee
were
sent
through
me
but
from
the
army
of
the
ohio
they
were
sent
by
general
buell
without
passing
through
my
hands
general
halleck
ordered
me
verbally
to
send
in
my
report
but
i
positively
declined
on
the
ground
that
he
had
received
the
reports
of
a
part
of
the
army
engaged
at
shiloh
without
their
coming
through
me
he
admitted
that
my
refusal
was
justifiable
under
the
circumstances
but
explained
that
he
had
wanted
to
get
the
reports
off
before
moving
the
command
and
as
fast
as
a
report
had
come
to
him
he
had
forwarded
it
to
washington
preparations
were
at
once
made
upon
the
arrival
of
the
new
commander
for
an
advance
on
corinth
owl
creek
on
our
right
was
bridged
and
expeditions
were
sent
to
the
and
west
to
ascertain
if
our
position
was
being
threatened
from
those
quarters
the
roads
towards
corinth
were
corduroyed
and
new
ones
made
lateral
roads
were
also
constructed
so
that
in
case
of
necessity
troops
marching
by
different
routes
could
reinforce
each
other
all
commanders
were
cautioned
against
bringing
on
an
engagement
and
informed
in
so
many
words
that
it
would
be
better
to
retreat
than
to
fight
by
the
of
april
all
preparations
were
complete
the
country
west
to
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
had
been
reconnoitred
as
well
as
the
road
to
corinth
as
far
as
monterey
twelve
miles
from
pittsburg
everywhere
small
bodies
of
the
enemy
had
been
encountered
but
they
were
observers
and
not
in
force
to
fight
battles
corinth
mississippi
lies
in
a
direction
from
pittsburg
landing
and
about
nineteen
miles
away
as
the
bird
would
fly
but
probably
by
the
nearest
it
is
about
four
miles
south
of
the
line
dividing
the
states
of
tennessee
and
mississippi
and
at
the
junction
of
the
mississippi
and
chattanooga
railroad
with
the
mobile
and
ohio
road
which
runs
from
columbus
to
mobile
from
pittsburg
to
corinth
the
land
is
rolling
but
at
no
point
reaching
an
elevation
that
makes
high
hills
to
pass
over
in
the
greater
part
of
the
country
was
covered
with
forest
with
intervening
clearings
and
houses
underbrush
was
dense
in
the
low
grounds
along
the
creeks
and
ravines
but
generally
not
so
thick
on
the
high
land
as
to
prevent
men
passing
through
with
ease
there
are
two
small
creeks
running
from
north
of
the
town
and
connecting
some
four
miles
south
where
they
form
bridge
creek
which
empties
into
the
tuscumbia
river
corinth
is
on
the
ridge
between
these
streams
and
is
a
naturally
strong
defensive
position
the
creeks
are
insignificant
in
volume
of
water
but
the
stream
to
the
east
widens
out
in
front
of
the
town
into
a
swamp
impassable
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
on
the
crest
of
the
west
bank
of
this
stream
the
enemy
was
strongly
intrenched
corinth
was
a
valuable
strategic
point
for
the
enemy
to
hold
and
consequently
a
valuable
one
for
us
to
possess
ourselves
of
we
ought
to
have
seized
it
immediately
after
the
fall
of
donelson
and
nashville
when
it
could
have
been
taken
without
a
battle
but
failing
then
it
should
have
been
taken
without
delay
on
the
concentration
of
troops
at
pittsburg
landing
after
the
battle
of
shiloh
in
fact
the
arrival
of
pope
should
not
have
been
awaited
there
was
no
time
from
the
battle
of
shiloh
up
to
the
evacuation
of
corinth
when
the
enemy
would
not
have
left
if
pushed
the
demoralization
among
the
confederates
from
their
defeats
at
henry
and
donelson
their
long
marches
from
bowling
green
columbus
and
nashville
and
their
failure
at
shiloh
in
fact
from
having
been
driven
out
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
was
so
great
that
a
stand
for
the
time
would
have
been
impossible
beauregard
made
strenuous
efforts
to
reinforce
himself
and
partially
succeeded
he
appealed
to
the
people
of
the
for
new
regiments
and
received
a
few
johnston
had
made
efforts
to
reinforce
in
the
same
quarter
before
the
battle
of
shiloh
but
in
a
different
way
he
had
negroes
sent
out
to
him
to
take
the
place
of
teamsters
company
cooks
and
laborers
in
every
capacity
so
as
to
put
all
his
white
men
into
the
ranks
the
people
while
willing
to
send
their
sons
to
the
field
were
not
willing
to
part
with
their
negroes
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
they
probably
wanted
their
blacks
to
raise
supplies
for
the
army
and
for
the
families
left
at
home
beauregard
however
was
reinforced
by
van
dorn
immediately
after
shiloh
with
men
interior
points
less
exposed
were
also
depleted
to
add
to
the
strength
at
corinth
with
these
reinforcements
and
the
new
regiments
beauregard
had
during
the
month
of
may
a
large
force
on
paper
but
probably
not
much
over
effective
men
we
estimated
his
strength
at
our
own
was
in
round
numbers
the
defensible
nature
of
the
ground
at
corinth
and
the
fortifications
made
then
enough
to
maintain
their
position
against
double
that
number
for
an
indefinite
time
but
for
the
demoralization
spoken
of
on
the
of
april
the
grand
army
commenced
its
advance
from
shiloh
upon
corinth
the
movement
was
a
siege
from
the
start
to
the
close
the
national
troops
were
always
behind
intrenchments
except
of
course
the
small
reconnoitring
parties
sent
to
the
front
to
clear
the
way
for
an
advance
even
the
commanders
of
these
parties
were
cautioned
not
to
bring
on
an
engagement
it
is
better
to
retreat
than
to
fight
the
enemy
were
constantly
watching
our
advance
but
as
they
were
simply
observers
there
were
but
few
engagements
that
even
threatened
to
become
battles
all
the
engagements
fought
ought
to
have
served
to
encourage
the
enemy
roads
were
again
made
in
our
front
and
again
corduroyed
a
line
was
intrenched
and
the
troops
were
advanced
to
the
new
position
cross
roads
were
constructed
to
these
new
positions
to
enable
the
troops
to
concentrate
in
case
of
attack
the
national
armies
were
thoroughly
intrenched
all
the
way
from
the
tennessee
river
to
corinth
for
myself
i
was
little
more
than
an
observer
orders
were
sent
direct
to
the
right
wing
or
reserve
ignoring
me
and
advances
were
made
from
one
line
of
intrenchments
to
another
without
notifying
me
my
position
was
so
embarrassing
in
fact
that
i
made
several
applications
during
the
siege
to
be
relieved
general
halleck
kept
his
headquarters
generally
if
not
all
the
time
with
the
right
wing
pope
being
on
the
extreme
left
did
not
see
so
much
of
his
chief
and
consequently
got
loose
as
it
were
at
times
on
the
of
may
he
was
at
seven
mile
creek
with
the
main
body
of
his
command
but
threw
forward
a
division
to
farmington
within
four
miles
of
corinth
his
troops
had
quite
a
little
engagement
at
farmington
on
that
day
but
carried
the
place
with
considerable
loss
to
the
enemy
there
would
then
have
been
no
difficulty
in
advancing
the
centre
and
right
so
as
to
form
a
new
line
well
up
to
the
enemy
but
pope
was
ordered
back
to
conform
with
the
general
line
on
the
of
may
he
moved
again
taking
his
whole
force
to
farmington
and
pushed
out
two
divisions
close
to
the
rebel
line
again
he
was
ordered
back
by
the
of
may
the
centre
and
right
wing
reached
monterey
twelve
miles
out
their
advance
was
slow
from
there
for
they
intrenched
with
every
forward
movement
the
left
wing
moved
up
again
on
the
of
may
and
intrenched
itself
close
to
the
enemy
the
creek
with
the
marsh
before
described
separated
the
two
lines
skirmishers
thirty
feet
apart
could
have
maintained
either
line
at
this
point
our
centre
and
right
were
at
this
time
extended
so
that
the
right
of
the
right
wing
was
probably
five
miles
from
corinth
and
four
from
the
works
in
their
front
the
creek
which
was
a
formidable
obstacle
for
either
side
to
pass
on
our
left
became
a
very
slight
obstacle
on
our
right
here
the
enemy
occupied
two
positions
one
of
them
as
much
as
two
miles
out
from
his
main
line
was
on
a
commanding
elevation
and
defended
by
an
intrenched
battery
with
infantry
supports
a
heavy
wood
intervened
between
this
work
and
the
national
forces
in
rear
to
the
south
there
was
a
clearing
extending
a
mile
or
more
and
south
of
this
clearing
a
which
had
been
and
was
occupied
by
infantry
sherman
division
carried
these
two
positions
with
some
loss
to
himself
but
with
probably
greater
to
the
enemy
on
the
of
may
and
on
that
day
the
investment
of
corinth
was
complete
or
as
complete
as
it
was
ever
made
thomas
right
now
rested
west
of
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
pope
left
commanded
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
east
of
corinth
some
days
before
i
had
suggested
to
the
commanding
general
that
i
thought
if
he
would
move
the
army
of
the
mississippi
at
night
by
the
rear
of
the
centre
and
right
ready
to
advance
at
daylight
pope
would
find
no
natural
obstacle
in
his
front
and
i
believed
no
serious
artificial
one
the
ground
or
works
occupied
by
our
left
could
be
held
by
a
thin
picket
line
owing
to
the
stream
and
swamp
in
front
to
the
right
the
troops
would
have
a
dry
ridge
to
march
over
i
was
silenced
so
quickly
that
i
felt
that
possibly
i
had
suggested
an
unmilitary
movement
later
probably
on
the
of
may
general
logan
whose
command
was
then
on
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
said
to
me
that
the
enemy
had
been
evacuating
for
several
days
and
that
if
allowed
he
could
go
into
corinth
with
his
brigade
trains
of
cars
were
heard
coming
in
and
going
out
of
corinth
constantly
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
engaged
in
various
capacities
on
railroads
before
the
war
claimed
that
they
could
tell
by
putting
their
ears
to
the
rail
not
only
which
way
the
trains
were
moving
but
which
trains
were
loaded
and
which
were
empty
they
said
loaded
trains
had
been
going
out
for
several
days
and
empty
ones
coming
in
subsequent
events
proved
the
correctness
of
their
judgment
beauregard
published
his
orders
for
the
evacuation
of
corinth
on
the
of
may
and
fixed
the
for
the
departure
of
his
troops
and
on
the
of
may
general
halleck
had
his
whole
army
drawn
up
prepared
for
battle
and
announced
in
orders
that
there
was
every
indication
that
our
left
was
to
be
attacked
that
morning
corinth
had
already
been
evacuated
and
the
national
troops
marched
on
and
took
possession
without
opposition
everything
had
been
destroyed
or
carried
away
the
confederate
commander
had
instructed
his
soldiers
to
cheer
on
the
arrival
of
every
train
to
create
the
impression
among
the
yankees
that
reinforcements
were
arriving
there
was
not
a
sick
or
wounded
man
left
by
the
confederates
nor
stores
of
any
kind
some
ammunition
had
been
blown
up
not
removed
but
the
trophies
of
war
were
a
few
quaker
guns
logs
of
about
the
diameter
of
ordinary
cannon
mounted
on
wheels
of
wagons
and
pointed
in
the
most
threatening
manner
towards
us
the
possession
of
corinth
by
the
national
troops
was
of
strategic
importance
but
the
victory
was
barren
in
every
other
particular
it
was
nearly
bloodless
it
is
a
question
whether
the
morale
of
the
confederate
troops
engaged
at
corinth
was
not
improved
by
the
immunity
with
which
they
were
permitted
to
remove
all
public
property
and
then
withdraw
themselves
on
our
side
i
know
officers
and
men
of
the
army
of
the
tennessee
and
i
presume
the
same
is
true
of
those
of
the
other
commands
were
disappointed
at
the
result
they
could
not
see
how
the
mere
occupation
of
places
was
to
close
the
war
while
large
and
effective
rebel
armies
existed
they
believed
that
a
attack
would
at
least
have
partially
destroyed
the
army
defending
corinth
for
myself
i
am
satisfied
that
corinth
could
have
been
captured
in
a
two
days
campaign
commenced
promptly
on
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
after
the
battle
of
shiloh
general
halleck
at
once
commenced
erecting
fortifications
around
corinth
on
a
scale
to
indicate
that
this
one
point
must
be
held
if
it
took
the
whole
national
army
to
do
it
all
commanding
points
two
or
three
miles
to
the
south
and
were
strongly
fortified
it
was
expected
in
case
of
necessity
to
connect
these
forts
by
they
were
laid
out
on
a
scale
that
would
have
required
men
to
fully
man
them
it
was
probably
thought
that
a
final
battle
of
the
war
would
be
fought
at
that
point
these
fortifications
were
never
used
immediately
after
the
occupation
of
corinth
by
the
national
troops
general
pope
was
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
garrison
and
general
buell
soon
followed
buell
was
the
senior
of
the
two
generals
and
commanded
the
entire
column
the
pursuit
was
kept
up
for
some
thirty
miles
but
did
not
result
in
the
capture
of
any
material
of
war
or
prisoners
unless
a
few
stragglers
who
had
fallen
behind
and
were
willing
captives
on
the
of
june
the
pursuing
column
was
all
back
at
corinth
the
army
of
the
tennessee
was
not
engaged
in
any
of
these
movements
the
confederates
were
now
driven
out
of
west
tennessee
and
on
the
of
june
after
a
naval
battle
the
national
forces
took
possession
of
memphis
and
held
the
mississippi
river
from
its
source
to
that
point
the
railroad
from
columbus
to
corinth
was
at
once
put
in
good
condition
and
held
by
us
we
had
garrisons
at
donelson
clarksville
and
nashville
on
the
cumberland
river
and
held
the
tennessee
river
from
its
mouth
to
eastport
new
orleans
and
baton
rouge
had
fallen
into
the
possession
of
the
national
forces
so
that
now
the
confederates
at
the
west
were
narrowed
down
for
all
communication
with
richmond
to
the
single
line
of
road
running
east
from
vicksburg
to
dispossess
them
of
this
therefore
became
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
the
possession
of
the
mississippi
by
us
from
memphis
to
baton
rouge
was
also
a
most
important
object
it
would
be
equal
to
the
amputation
of
a
limb
in
its
weakening
effects
upon
the
enemy
after
the
capture
of
corinth
a
movable
force
of
men
besides
enough
to
hold
all
the
territory
acquired
could
have
been
set
in
motion
for
the
accomplishment
of
any
great
campaign
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
in
addition
to
this
fresh
troops
were
being
raised
to
swell
the
effective
force
but
the
work
of
depletion
commenced
buell
with
the
army
of
the
ohio
was
sent
east
following
the
line
of
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
this
he
was
ordered
to
repair
as
he
advanced
only
to
have
it
destroyed
by
small
guerilla
bands
or
other
troops
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
way
if
he
had
been
sent
directly
to
chattanooga
as
rapidly
as
he
could
march
leaving
two
or
three
divisions
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
from
nashville
forward
he
could
have
arrived
with
but
little
fighting
and
would
have
saved
much
of
the
loss
of
life
which
was
afterwards
incurred
in
gaining
chattanooga
bragg
would
then
not
have
had
time
to
raise
an
army
to
contest
the
possession
of
middle
and
east
tennessee
and
kentucky
the
battles
of
stone
river
and
chickamauga
would
not
necessarily
have
been
fought
burnside
would
not
have
been
besieged
in
knoxville
without
the
power
of
helping
himself
or
escaping
the
battle
of
chattanooga
would
not
have
been
fought
these
are
the
negative
advantages
if
the
term
negative
is
applicable
which
would
probably
have
resulted
from
prompt
movements
after
corinth
fell
into
the
possession
of
the
national
forces
the
positive
results
might
have
been
a
bloodless
advance
to
atlanta
to
vicksburg
or
to
any
other
desired
point
south

my
position
at
corinth
with
a
nominal
command
and
yet
no
command
became
so
unbearable
that
i
asked
permission
of
halleck
to
remove
my
headquarters
to
memphis
i
had
repeatedly
asked
between
the
fall
of
donelson
and
the
evacuation
of
corinth
to
be
relieved
from
duty
under
halleck
but
all
my
applications
were
refused
until
the
occupation
of
the
town
i
then
obtained
permission
to
leave
the
department
but
general
sherman
happened
to
call
on
me
as
i
was
about
starting
and
urged
me
so
strongly
not
to
think
of
going
that
i
concluded
to
remain
my
application
to
be
permitted
to
remove
my
headquarters
to
memphis
was
however
approved
and
on
the
of
june
i
started
for
that
point
with
my
staff
and
a
cavalry
escort
of
only
a
part
of
one
company
there
was
a
detachment
of
two
or
three
companies
going
some
miles
west
to
be
stationed
as
a
guard
to
the
railroad
i
went
under
cover
of
this
escort
to
the
end
of
their
march
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
to
la
grange
with
no
convoy
but
the
few
cavalry
men
i
had
with
me
from
la
grange
to
memphis
the
distance
is
miles
there
were
no
troops
stationed
between
these
two
points
except
a
small
force
guarding
a
working
party
which
was
engaged
in
repairing
the
railroad
not
knowing
where
this
party
would
be
found
i
halted
at
la
grange
general
hurlbut
was
in
command
there
at
the
time
and
had
his
headquarters
tents
pitched
on
the
lawn
of
a
very
commodious
country
house
the
proprietor
was
at
home
and
learning
of
my
arrival
he
invited
general
hurlbut
and
me
to
dine
with
him
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
spent
a
very
pleasant
afternoon
with
my
host
who
was
a
thorough
southern
gentleman
fully
convinced
of
the
justice
of
secession
after
dinner
seated
in
the
capacious
porch
he
entertained
me
with
a
recital
of
the
services
he
was
rendering
the
cause
he
was
too
old
to
be
in
the
ranks
himself
he
must
have
been
quite
seventy
then
but
his
means
enabled
him
to
be
useful
in
other
ways
in
ordinary
times
the
homestead
where
he
was
now
living
produced
the
bread
and
meat
to
supply
the
slaves
on
his
main
plantation
in
the
of
mississippi
now
he
raised
food
and
forage
on
both
places
and
thought
he
would
have
that
year
a
surplus
sufficient
to
feed
three
hundred
families
of
poor
men
who
had
gone
into
the
war
and
left
their
families
dependent
upon
the
patriotism
of
those
better
off
the
crops
around
me
looked
fine
and
i
had
at
the
moment
an
idea
that
about
the
time
they
were
ready
to
be
gathered
the
yankee
troops
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
and
harvest
them
for
the
benefit
of
those
engaged
in
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
instead
of
its
support
i
felt
however
the
greatest
respect
for
the
candor
of
my
host
and
for
his
zeal
in
a
cause
he
thoroughly
believed
in
though
our
views
were
as
wide
apart
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
the
of
june
on
the
road
from
la
grange
to
memphis
was
very
warm
even
for
that
latitude
and
season
with
my
staff
and
small
escort
i
started
at
an
early
hour
and
before
noon
we
arrived
within
twenty
miles
of
memphis
at
this
point
i
saw
a
very
gentleman
seated
at
the
front
of
his
house
a
little
distance
from
the
road
i
let
my
staff
and
escort
ride
ahead
while
i
halted
and
for
an
excuse
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
i
was
invited
at
once
to
dismount
and
come
in
i
found
my
host
very
genial
and
communicative
and
staid
longer
than
i
had
intended
until
the
lady
of
the
house
announced
dinner
and
asked
me
to
join
them
the
host
however
was
not
pressing
so
that
i
declined
the
invitation
and
mounting
my
horse
rode
on
about
a
mile
west
from
where
i
had
been
stopping
a
road
comes
up
from
the
southeast
joining
that
from
la
grange
to
memphis
a
mile
west
of
this
junction
i
found
my
staff
and
escort
halted
and
enjoying
the
shade
of
forest
trees
on
the
lawn
of
a
house
located
several
hundred
feet
back
from
the
road
their
horses
hitched
to
the
fence
along
the
line
of
the
road
i
too
stopped
and
we
remained
there
until
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
and
then
rode
into
memphis
the
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
stopped
twenty
miles
from
memphis
was
a
de
loche
a
man
loyal
to
the
union
he
had
not
pressed
me
to
tarry
longer
with
him
because
in
the
early
part
of
my
visit
a
neighbor
a
smith
had
called
and
on
being
presented
to
me
backed
off
the
porch
as
if
something
had
hit
him
de
loche
knew
that
the
rebel
general
jackson
was
in
that
neighborhood
with
a
detachment
of
cavalry
his
neighbor
was
as
earnest
in
the
southern
cause
as
was
de
loche
in
that
of
the
union
the
exact
location
of
jackson
was
entirely
unknown
to
de
loche
but
he
was
sure
that
his
neighbor
would
know
it
and
would
give
information
of
my
presence
and
this
made
my
stay
unpleasant
to
him
after
the
call
of
smith
i
have
stated
that
a
detachment
of
troops
was
engaged
in
guarding
workmen
who
were
repairing
the
railroad
east
of
memphis
on
the
day
i
entered
memphis
jackson
captured
a
small
herd
of
beef
cattle
which
had
been
sent
east
for
the
troops
so
engaged
the
drovers
were
not
enlisted
men
and
he
released
them
a
day
or
two
after
one
of
these
drovers
came
to
my
headquarters
and
relating
the
circumstances
of
his
capture
said
jackson
was
very
much
disappointed
that
he
had
not
captured
me
that
he
was
six
or
seven
miles
south
of
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
when
he
learned
that
i
was
stopping
at
the
house
of
de
loche
and
had
ridden
with
his
command
to
the
junction
of
the
road
he
was
on
with
that
from
la
grange
and
memphis
where
he
learned
that
i
had
passed
of
an
hour
before
he
thought
it
would
be
useless
to
pursue
with
jaded
horses
a
party
with
so
much
of
a
start
had
he
gone
of
a
mile
farther
he
would
have
found
me
with
my
party
quietly
resting
under
the
shade
of
trees
and
without
even
arms
in
our
hands
with
which
to
defend
ourselves
general
jackson
of
course
did
not
communicate
his
disappointment
at
not
capturing
me
to
a
prisoner
a
young
drover
but
from
the
talk
among
the
soldiers
the
facts
related
were
learned
a
day
or
two
later
de
loche
called
on
me
in
memphis
to
apologize
for
his
apparent
incivility
in
not
insisting
on
my
staying
for
dinner
he
said
that
his
wife
accused
him
of
marked
discourtesy
but
that
after
the
call
of
his
neighbor
he
had
felt
restless
until
i
got
away
i
never
met
general
jackson
before
the
war
nor
during
it
but
have
met
him
since
at
his
very
comfortable
summer
home
at
manitou
springs
colorado
i
reminded
him
of
the
above
incident
and
this
drew
from
him
the
response
that
he
was
thankful
now
he
had
not
captured
me
i
certainly
was
very
thankful
too
my
occupation
of
memphis
as
district
headquarters
did
not
last
long
the
period
however
was
marked
by
a
few
incidents
which
were
novel
to
me
up
to
that
time
i
had
not
occupied
any
place
in
the
south
where
the
citizens
were
at
home
in
any
great
numbers
dover
was
within
the
fortifications
at
fort
donelson
and
as
far
as
i
remember
every
citizen
was
gone
there
were
no
people
living
at
pittsburg
landing
and
but
very
few
at
corinth
memphis
however
was
a
populous
city
and
there
were
many
of
the
citizens
remaining
there
who
were
not
only
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
justice
of
their
cause
but
who
thought
that
even
the
yankee
soldiery
must
entertain
the
same
views
if
they
could
only
be
induced
to
make
an
honest
confession
it
took
hours
of
my
time
every
day
to
listen
to
complaints
and
requests
the
latter
were
generally
reasonable
and
if
so
they
were
granted
but
the
complaints
were
not
always
or
even
often
well
founded
two
instances
will
mark
the
general
character
first
the
officer
who
commanded
at
memphis
immediately
after
the
city
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
national
troops
had
ordered
one
of
the
churches
of
the
city
to
be
opened
to
the
soldiers
army
chaplains
were
authorized
to
occupy
the
pulpit
second
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
confederate
congress
had
passed
a
law
confiscating
all
property
of
alien
enemies
at
the
south
including
the
debts
of
southerners
to
northern
men
in
consequence
of
this
law
when
memphis
was
occupied
the
had
forcibly
collected
all
the
evidences
he
could
obtain
of
such
debts
almost
the
first
complaints
made
to
me
were
these
two
outrages
the
gentleman
who
made
the
complaints
informed
me
first
of
his
own
high
standing
as
a
lawyer
a
citizen
and
a
christian
he
was
a
deacon
in
the
church
which
had
been
defiled
by
the
occupation
of
union
troops
and
by
a
union
chaplain
filling
the
pulpit
he
did
not
use
the
word
defile
but
he
expressed
the
idea
very
clearly
he
asked
that
the
church
be
restored
to
the
former
congregation
i
told
him
that
no
order
had
been
issued
prohibiting
the
congregation
attending
the
church
he
said
of
course
the
congregation
could
not
hear
a
northern
clergyman
who
differed
so
radically
with
them
on
questions
of
government
i
told
him
the
troops
would
continue
to
occupy
that
church
for
the
present
and
that
they
would
not
be
called
upon
to
hear
disloyal
sentiments
proclaimed
from
the
pulpit
this
closed
the
argument
on
the
first
point
then
came
the
second
the
complainant
said
that
he
wanted
the
papers
restored
to
him
which
had
been
surrendered
to
the
under
protest
he
was
a
lawyer
and
before
the
establishment
of
the
confederate
states
government
had
been
the
attorney
for
a
number
of
large
business
houses
at
the
north
that
his
government
had
confiscated
all
debts
due
alien
enemies
and
appointed
commissioners
or
officers
to
collect
such
debts
and
pay
them
over
to
the
government
but
in
his
case
owing
to
his
high
standing
he
had
been
permitted
to
hold
these
claims
for
collection
the
responsible
officials
knowing
that
he
would
account
to
the
government
for
every
dollar
received
he
said
that
his
government
when
it
came
in
possession
of
all
its
territory
would
hold
him
personally
responsible
for
the
claims
he
had
surrendered
to
the
his
impudence
was
so
sublime
that
i
was
rather
amused
than
indignant
i
told
him
however
that
if
he
would
remain
in
memphis
i
did
not
believe
the
confederate
government
would
ever
molest
him
he
left
no
doubt
as
much
amazed
at
my
assurance
as
i
was
at
the
brazenness
of
his
request
on
the
of
july
general
halleck
received
telegraphic
orders
appointing
him
to
the
command
of
all
the
armies
with
headquarters
in
washington
his
instructions
pressed
him
to
proceed
to
his
new
field
of
duty
with
as
little
delay
as
was
consistent
with
the
safety
and
interests
of
his
previous
command
i
was
next
in
rank
and
he
telegraphed
me
the
same
day
to
report
at
department
headquarters
at
corinth
i
was
not
informed
by
the
dispatch
that
my
chief
had
been
ordered
to
a
different
field
and
did
not
know
whether
to
move
my
headquarters
or
not
i
telegraphed
asking
if
i
was
to
take
my
staff
with
me
and
received
word
in
reply
this
place
will
be
your
headquarters
you
can
judge
for
yourself
i
left
memphis
for
my
new
field
without
delay
and
reached
corinth
on
the
of
the
month
general
halleck
remained
until
the
of
july
but
he
was
very
uncommunicative
and
gave
me
no
information
as
to
what
i
had
been
called
to
corinth
for
when
general
halleck
left
to
assume
the
duties
of
i
remained
in
command
of
the
district
of
west
tennessee
practically
i
became
a
department
commander
because
no
one
was
assigned
to
that
position
over
me
and
i
made
my
reports
direct
to
the
but
i
was
not
assigned
to
the
position
of
department
commander
until
the
of
october
general
halleck
while
commanding
the
department
of
the
mississippi
had
had
control
as
far
east
as
a
line
drawn
from
chattanooga
north
my
district
only
embraced
west
tennessee
and
kentucky
west
of
the
cumberland
river
buell
with
the
army
of
the
ohio
had
as
previously
stated
been
ordered
east
towards
chattanooga
with
instructions
to
repair
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
as
he
advanced
troops
had
been
sent
north
by
halleck
along
the
line
of
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
to
put
it
in
repair
as
far
as
columbus
other
troops
were
stationed
on
the
railroad
from
jackson
tennessee
to
grand
junction
and
still
others
on
the
road
west
to
memphis
the
remainder
of
the
magnificent
army
of
men
which
entered
corinth
on
the
of
may
had
now
become
so
scattered
that
i
was
put
entirely
on
the
defensive
in
a
territory
whose
population
was
hostile
to
the
union
one
of
the
first
things
i
had
to
do
was
to
construct
fortifications
at
corinth
better
suited
to
the
garrison
that
could
be
spared
to
man
them
the
structures
that
had
been
built
during
the
months
of
may
and
june
were
left
as
monuments
to
the
skill
of
the
engineer
and
others
were
constructed
in
a
few
days
plainer
in
design
but
suited
to
the
command
available
to
defend
them
i
disposed
the
troops
belonging
to
the
district
in
conformity
with
the
situation
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
forces
at
donelson
clarksville
and
nashville
with
those
at
corinth
and
along
the
railroad
eastward
i
regarded
as
sufficient
for
protection
against
any
attack
from
the
west
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
was
guarded
from
rienzi
south
of
corinth
to
columbus
and
the
mississippi
central
railroad
from
jackson
tennessee
to
bolivar
grand
junction
and
la
grange
on
the
memphis
railroad
were
abandoned
south
of
the
army
of
the
tennessee
and
confronting
it
was
van
dorn
with
a
sufficient
force
to
organize
a
movable
army
of
to
forty
thousand
men
after
being
reinforced
by
price
from
missouri
this
movable
force
could
be
thrown
against
either
corinth
bolivar
or
memphis
and
the
best
that
could
be
done
in
such
event
would
be
to
weaken
the
points
not
threatened
in
order
to
reinforce
the
one
that
was
nothing
could
be
gained
on
the
national
side
by
attacking
elsewhere
because
the
territory
already
occupied
was
as
much
as
the
force
present
could
guard
the
most
anxious
period
of
the
war
to
me
was
during
the
time
the
army
of
the
tennessee
was
guarding
the
territory
acquired
by
the
fall
of
corinth
and
memphis
and
before
i
was
sufficiently
reinforced
to
take
the
offensive
the
enemy
also
had
cavalry
operating
in
our
rear
making
it
necessary
to
guard
every
point
of
the
railroad
back
to
columbus
on
the
security
of
which
we
were
dependent
for
all
our
supplies
headquarters
were
connected
by
telegraph
with
all
points
of
the
command
except
memphis
and
the
mississippi
below
columbus
with
these
points
communication
was
had
by
the
railroad
to
columbus
then
down
the
river
by
boat
to
reinforce
memphis
would
take
three
or
four
days
and
to
get
an
order
there
for
troops
to
move
elsewhere
would
have
taken
at
least
two
days
memphis
therefore
was
practically
isolated
from
the
balance
of
the
command
but
it
was
in
sherman
hands
then
too
the
troops
were
well
intrenched
and
the
gunboats
made
a
valuable
auxiliary
during
the
two
months
after
the
departure
of
general
halleck
there
was
much
fighting
between
small
bodies
of
the
contending
armies
but
these
encounters
were
dwarfed
by
the
magnitude
of
the
main
battles
so
as
to
be
now
almost
forgotten
except
by
those
engaged
in
them
some
of
them
however
estimated
by
the
losses
on
both
sides
in
killed
and
wounded
were
equal
in
hard
fighting
to
most
of
the
battles
of
the
mexican
war
which
attracted
so
much
of
the
attention
of
the
public
when
they
occurred
about
the
of
july
colonel
ross
commanding
at
bolivar
was
threatened
by
a
large
force
of
the
enemy
so
that
he
had
to
be
reinforced
from
jackson
and
corinth
on
the
there
was
skirmishing
on
the
hatchie
river
eight
miles
from
bolivar
on
the
i
learned
from
colonel
sheridan
who
had
been
far
to
the
south
that
bragg
in
person
was
at
rome
georgia
with
his
troops
moving
by
rail
by
way
of
mobile
to
chattanooga
and
his
wagon
train
marching
overland
to
join
him
at
rome
price
was
at
this
time
at
holly
springs
mississippi
with
a
large
force
and
occupied
grand
junction
as
an
outpost
i
proposed
to
the
to
be
permitted
to
drive
him
away
but
was
informed
that
while
i
had
to
judge
for
myself
the
best
use
to
make
of
my
troops
was
not
to
scatter
them
but
hold
them
ready
to
reinforce
buell
the
movement
of
bragg
himself
with
his
wagon
trains
to
chattanooga
across
country
while
his
troops
were
transported
over
a
long
road
to
the
same
destination
without
need
of
guards
except
when
in
my
immediate
front
demonstrates
the
advantage
which
troops
enjoy
while
acting
in
a
country
where
the
people
are
friendly
buell
was
marching
through
a
hostile
region
and
had
to
have
his
communications
thoroughly
guarded
back
to
a
base
of
supplies
more
men
were
required
the
farther
the
national
troops
penetrated
into
the
enemy
country
i
with
an
army
sufficiently
powerful
to
have
destroyed
bragg
was
purely
on
the
defensive
and
accomplishing
no
more
than
to
hold
a
force
far
inferior
to
my
own
on
the
of
august
i
was
ordered
from
washington
to
live
upon
the
country
on
the
resources
of
citizens
hostile
to
the
government
so
far
as
practicable
i
was
also
directed
to
handle
rebels
within
our
lines
without
gloves
to
imprison
them
or
to
expel
them
from
their
homes
and
from
our
lines
i
do
not
recollect
having
arrested
and
confined
a
citizen
not
a
soldier
during
the
entire
rebellion
i
am
aware
that
a
great
many
were
sent
to
northern
prisons
particularly
to
joliet
illinois
by
some
of
my
subordinates
with
the
statement
that
it
was
my
order
i
had
all
such
released
the
moment
i
learned
of
their
arrest
and
finally
sent
a
staff
officer
north
to
release
every
prisoner
who
was
said
to
be
confined
by
my
order
there
were
many
citizens
at
home
who
deserved
punishment
because
they
were
soldiers
when
an
opportunity
was
afforded
to
inflict
an
injury
to
the
national
cause
this
class
was
not
of
the
kind
that
were
apt
to
get
arrested
and
i
deemed
it
better
that
a
few
guilty
men
should
escape
than
that
a
great
many
innocent
ones
should
suffer
on
the
of
august
i
was
ordered
to
send
two
more
divisions
to
buell
they
were
sent
the
same
day
by
way
of
decatur
on
the
colonel
rodney
mason
surrendered
clarksville
with
six
companies
of
his
regiment
colonel
mason
was
one
of
the
officers
who
had
led
their
regiments
off
the
field
at
almost
the
first
fire
of
the
rebels
at
shiloh
he
was
by
nature
and
education
a
gentleman
and
was
terribly
mortified
at
his
action
when
the
battle
was
over
he
came
to
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
have
another
trial
i
felt
great
sympathy
for
him
and
sent
him
with
his
regiment
to
garrison
clarksville
and
donelson
he
selected
clarksville
for
his
headquarters
no
doubt
because
he
regarded
it
as
the
post
of
danger
it
being
nearer
the
enemy
but
when
he
was
summoned
to
surrender
by
a
band
of
guerillas
his
constitutional
weakness
overcame
him
he
inquired
the
number
of
men
the
enemy
had
and
receiving
a
response
indicating
a
force
greater
than
his
own
he
said
if
he
could
be
satisfied
of
that
fact
he
would
surrender
arrangements
were
made
for
him
to
count
the
guerillas
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
enemy
had
the
greater
force
he
surrendered
and
informed
his
subordinate
at
donelson
of
the
fact
advising
him
to
do
the
same
the
guerillas
paroled
their
prisoners
and
moved
upon
donelson
but
the
officer
in
command
at
that
point
marched
out
to
meet
them
and
drove
them
away
among
other
embarrassments
at
the
time
of
which
i
now
write
was
the
fact
that
the
government
wanted
to
get
out
all
the
cotton
possible
from
the
south
and
directed
me
to
give
every
facility
toward
that
end
pay
in
gold
was
authorized
and
stations
on
the
mississippi
river
and
on
the
railroad
in
our
possession
had
to
be
designated
where
cotton
would
be
received
this
opened
to
the
enemy
not
only
the
means
of
converting
cotton
into
money
which
had
a
value
all
over
the
world
and
which
they
so
much
needed
but
it
afforded
them
means
of
obtaining
accurate
and
intelligent
information
in
regard
to
our
position
and
strength
it
was
also
demoralizing
to
the
troops
citizens
obtaining
permits
from
the
treasury
department
had
to
be
protected
within
our
lines
and
given
facilities
to
get
out
cotton
by
which
they
realized
enormous
profits
men
who
had
enlisted
to
fight
the
battles
of
their
country
did
not
like
to
be
engaged
in
protecting
a
traffic
which
went
to
the
support
of
an
enemy
they
had
to
fight
and
the
profits
of
which
went
to
men
who
shared
none
of
their
dangers
on
the
of
august
colonel
leggett
near
bolivar
with
the
and
ohio
volunteer
infantry
was
attacked
by
a
force
supposed
to
be
about
strong
the
enemy
was
driven
away
with
a
loss
of
more
than
one
hundred
men
on
the
of
september
the
bridge
guard
at
medon
was
attacked
by
guerillas
the
guard
held
the
position
until
reinforced
when
the
enemy
were
routed
leaving
about
fifty
of
their
number
on
the
field
dead
or
wounded
our
loss
being
only
two
killed
and
fifteen
wounded
on
the
same
day
colonel
dennis
with
a
force
of
less
than
infantry
and
two
pieces
of
artillery
met
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
in
strong
force
a
few
miles
west
of
medon
and
drove
them
away
with
great
loss
our
troops
buried
of
the
enemy
dead
left
upon
the
field
afterwards
it
was
found
that
all
the
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
the
battlefield
were
turned
into
hospitals
for
the
wounded
our
loss
as
reported
at
the
time
was
killed
and
wounded
on
the
of
september
i
was
ordered
to
send
more
reinforcements
to
buell
jackson
and
bolivar
were
yet
threatened
but
i
sent
the
reinforcements
on
the
i
received
direct
orders
to
send
granger
division
also
to
louisville
kentucky
general
buell
had
left
corinth
about
the
of
june
to
march
upon
chattanooga
bragg
who
had
superseded
beauregard
in
command
sent
one
division
from
tupelo
on
the
of
june
for
the
same
place
this
gave
buell
about
seventeen
days
start
if
he
had
not
been
required
to
repair
the
railroad
as
he
advanced
the
march
could
have
been
made
in
eighteen
days
at
the
outside
and
chattanooga
must
have
been
reached
by
the
national
forces
before
the
rebels
could
have
possibly
got
there
the
road
between
nashville
and
chattanooga
could
easily
have
been
put
in
repair
by
other
troops
so
that
communication
with
the
north
would
have
been
opened
in
a
short
time
after
the
occupation
of
the
place
by
the
national
troops
if
buell
had
been
permitted
to
move
in
the
first
instance
with
the
whole
of
the
army
of
the
ohio
and
that
portion
of
the
army
of
the
mississippi
afterwards
sent
to
him
he
could
have
thrown
four
divisions
from
his
own
command
along
the
line
of
road
to
repair
and
guard
it
granger
division
was
promptly
sent
on
the
of
september
i
was
at
the
station
at
corinth
when
the
troops
reached
that
point
and
found
general
sheridan
with
them
i
expressed
surprise
at
seeing
him
and
said
that
i
had
not
expected
him
to
go
he
showed
decided
disappointment
at
the
prospect
of
being
detained
i
felt
a
little
nettled
at
his
desire
to
get
away
and
did
not
detain
him
sheridan
was
a
first
lieutenant
in
the
regiment
in
which
i
had
served
eleven
years
the
infantry
and
stationed
on
the
pacific
coast
when
the
war
broke
out
he
was
promoted
to
a
captaincy
in
may
and
before
the
close
of
the
year
managed
in
some
way
i
do
not
know
how
to
get
east
he
went
to
missouri
halleck
had
known
him
as
a
very
successful
young
officer
in
managing
campaigns
against
the
indians
on
the
pacific
coast
and
appointed
him
in
missouri
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
supplies
forward
while
sheridan
served
in
that
capacity
but
he
got
into
difficulty
with
his
immediate
superiors
because
of
his
stringent
rules
for
preventing
the
use
of
public
transportation
for
private
purposes
he
asked
to
be
relieved
from
further
duty
in
the
capacity
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
his
request
was
granted
when
general
halleck
took
the
field
in
april
sheridan
was
assigned
to
duty
on
his
staff
during
the
advance
on
corinth
a
vacancy
occurred
in
the
colonelcy
of
the
michigan
cavalry
governor
blair
of
michigan
telegraphed
general
halleck
asking
him
to
suggest
the
name
of
a
professional
soldier
for
the
vacancy
saying
he
would
appoint
a
good
man
without
reference
to
his
state
sheridan
was
named
and
was
so
conspicuously
efficient
that
when
corinth
was
reached
he
was
assigned
to
command
a
cavalry
brigade
in
the
army
of
the
mississippi
he
was
in
command
at
booneville
on
the
of
july
with
two
small
regiments
when
he
was
attacked
by
a
force
full
three
times
as
numerous
as
his
own
by
very
skilful
manoeuvres
and
boldness
of
attack
he
completely
routed
the
enemy
for
this
he
was
made
a
and
became
a
conspicuous
figure
in
the
army
about
corinth
on
this
account
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
leaving
me
his
departure
was
probably
fortunate
for
he
rendered
distinguished
services
in
his
new
field
granger
and
sheridan
reached
louisville
before
buell
got
there
and
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
sheridan
with
his
command
threw
up
works
around
the
railroad
station
for
the
defence
of
troops
as
they
came
from
the
front
chapter
xxviii

danville
there
were
at
corinth

from

and
from

where
the

central
is

general
sherman
commanded
on

right
at

with
two
of
his
brigades
back
at
brownsville
at
the
crossing
of
the
hatchie
river
by
the
memphis
and
ohio
railroad
this
made
the
most
convenient
arrangement
i
could
devise
for
concentrating
all
my
spare
forces
upon
any
threatened
point
all
the
troops
of
the
command
were
within
telegraphic
communication
of
each
other
except
those
under
sherman
by
bringing
a
portion
of
his
command
to
brownsville
from
which
point
there
was
a
railroad
and
telegraph
back
to
memphis
communication
could
be
had
with
that
part
of
my
command
within
a
few
hours
by
the
use
of
couriers
in
case
it
became
necessary
to
reinforce
corinth
by
this
arrangement
all
the
troops
at
bolivar
except
a
small
guard
could
be
sent
by
rail
by
the
way
of
jackson
in
less
than
hours
while
the
troops
from
brownsville
could
march
up
to
bolivar
to
take
their
place
on
the
of
september
i
learned
of
the
advance
of
van
dorn
and
price
apparently
upon
corinth
one
division
was
brought
from
memphis
to
bolivar
to
meet
any
emergency
that
might
arise
from
this
move
of
the
enemy
i
was
much
concerned
because
my
first
duty
after
holding
the
territory
acquired
within
my
command
was
to
prevent
further
reinforcing
of
bragg
in
middle
tennessee
already
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
defeated
the
army
under
general
pope
and
was
invading
maryland
in
the
centre
general
buell
was
on
his
way
to
louisville
and
bragg
marching
parallel
to
him
with
a
large
confederate
force
for
the
ohio
river
i
had
been
constantly
called
upon
to
reinforce
buell
until
at
this
time
my
entire
force
numbered
less
than
men
of
all
arms
this
included
everything
from
cairo
south
within
my
jurisdiction
if
i
too
should
be
driven
back
the
ohio
river
would
become
the
line
dividing
the
belligerents
west
of
the
alleghanies
while
at
the
east
the
line
was
already
farther
north
than
when
hostilities
commenced
at
the
opening
of
the
war
it
is
true
nashville
was
never
given
up
after
its
first
capture
but
it
would
have
been
isolated
and
the
garrison
there
would
have
been
obliged
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
if
the
troops
in
west
tennessee
had
been
compelled
to
fall
back
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
of
the
war
the
line
dividing
the
contestants
at
the
east
was
pushed
north
of
maryland
a
state
that
had
not
seceded
and
at
the
west
beyond
kentucky
another
state
which
had
been
always
loyal
would
have
been
discouraging
indeed
as
it
was
many
loyal
people
despaired
in
the
fall
of
of
ever
saving
the
union
the
administration
at
washington
was
much
concerned
for
the
safety
of
the
cause
it
held
so
dear
but
i
believe
there
was
never
a
day
when
the
president
did
not
think
that
in
some
way
or
other
a
cause
so
just
as
ours
would
come
out
triumphant
up
to
the
of
september
rosecrans
still
had
troops
on
the
railroad
east
of
corinth
but
they
had
all
been
ordered
in
by
the
all
were
in
except
a
small
force
under
colonel
murphy
of
the
wisconsin
he
had
been
detained
to
guard
the
remainder
of
the
stores
which
had
not
yet
been
brought
in
to
corinth
on
the
of

general
sterling
price
entered
iuka
a
town
about
twenty
miles
east
of
corinth
on
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
colonel
murphy
with
a
few
men
was
guarding
the
place
he
made
no
resistance
but
evacuated
the
town
on
the
approach
of
the
enemy
i
was
apprehensive
lest
the
object
of
the
rebels
might
be
to
get
troops
into
tennessee
to
reinforce
bragg
as
it
was
afterwards
ascertained
to
be
the
authorities
at
washington
including
the
of
the
army
were
very
anxious
as
i
have
said
about
affairs
both
in
east
and
middle
tennessee
and
my
anxiety
was
quite
as
great
on
their
account
as
for
any
danger
threatening
my
command
i
had
not
force
enough
at
corinth
to
attack
price
even
by
stripping
everything
and
there
was
danger
that
before
troops
could
be
got
from
other
points
he
might
be
far
on
his
way
across
the
tennessee
to
prevent
this
all
spare
forces
at
bolivar
and
jackson
were
ordered
to
corinth
and
cars
were
concentrated
at
jackson
for
their
transportation
within
hours
from
the
transmission
of
the
order
the
troops
were
at
their
destination
although
there
had
been
a
delay
of
four
hours
resulting
from
the
forward
train
getting
off
the
track
and
stopping
all
the
others
this
gave
a
reinforcement
of
near
men
general
ord
in
command
general
rosecrans
commanded
the
district
of
corinth
with
a
movable
force
of
about
independent
of
the
garrison
deemed
necessary
to
be
left
behind
it
was
known
that
general
van
dorn
was
about
a
four
days
march
south
of
us
with
a
large
force
it
might
have
been
part
of
his
plan
to
attack
at
corinth
price
coming
from
the
east
while
he
came
up
from
the
south
my
desire
was
to
attack
price
before
van
dorn
could
reach
corinth
or
go
to
his
relief
general
rosecrans
had
previously
had
his
headquarters
at
iuka
where
his
command
was
spread
out
along
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
eastward
while
there
he
had
a
most
excellent
map
prepared
showing
all
the
roads
and
streams
in
the
surrounding
country
he
was
also
personally
familiar
with
the
ground
so
that
i
deferred
very
much
to
him
in
my
plans
for
the
approach
we
had
cars
enough
to
transport
all
of
general
ord
command
which
was
to
go
by
rail
to
burnsville
a
point
on
the
road
about
seven
miles
west
of
iuka
from
there
his
troops
were
to
march
by
the
north
side
of
the
railroad
and
attack
price
from
the
while
rosecrans
was
to
move
eastward
from
his
position
south
of
corinth
by
way
of
the
jacinto
road
a
small
force
was
to
hold
the
jacinto
road
where
it
turns
to
the
while
the
main
force
moved
on
the
fulton
road
which
comes
into
iuka
further
east
this
plan
was
suggested
by
rosecrans
bear
creek
a
few
miles
to
the
east
of
the
fulton
road
is
a
formidable
obstacle
to
the
movement
of
troops
in
the
absence
of
bridges
all
of
which
in
september
had
been
destroyed
in
that
vicinity
the
tennessee
to
the
not
many
miles
away
was
also
a
formidable
obstacle
for
an
army
followed
by
a
pursuing
force
ord
was
on
the
and
even
if
a
rebel
movement
had
been
possible
in
that
direction
it
could
have
brought
only
temporary
relief
for
it
would
have
carried
price
army
to
the
rear
of
the
national
forces
and
isolated
it
from
all
support
it
looked
to
me
that
if
price
would
remain
in
iuka
until
we
could
get
there
his
annihilation
was
inevitable
on
the
morning
of
the
of
september
general
ord
moved
by
rail
to
burnsville
and
there
left
the
cars
and
moved
out
to
perform
his
part
of
the
programme
he
was
to
get
as
near
the
enemy
as
possible
during
the
day
and
intrench
himself
so
as
to
hold
his
position
until
the
next
morning
rosecrans
was
to
be
up
by
the
morning
of
the
on
the
two
roads
before
described
and
the
attack
was
to
be
from
all
three
quarters
simultaneously
troops
enough
were
left
at
jacinto
and
rienzi
to
detain
any
cavalry
that
van
dorn
might
send
out
to
make
a
sudden
dash
into
corinth
until
i
could
be
notified
there
was
a
telegraph
wire
along
the
railroad
so
there
would
be
no
delay
in
communication
i
detained
cars
and
locomotives
enough
at
burnsville
to
transport
the
whole
of
command
at
once
and
if
van
dorn
had
moved
against
corinth
instead
of
iuka
i
could
have
thrown
in
reinforcements
to
the
number
of
or
before
he
could
have
arrived
i
remained
at
burnsville
with
a
detachment
of
about
men
from
ord
command
and
communicated
with
my
two
wings
by
courier
ord
met
the
advance
of
the
enemy
soon
after
leaving
burnsville
quite
a
sharp
engagement
ensued
but
he
drove
the
rebels
back
with
considerable
loss
including
one
general
officer
killed
he
maintained
his
position
and
was
ready
to
attack
by
daylight
the
next
morning
i
was
very
much
disappointed
at
receiving
a
dispatch
from
rosecrans
after
midnight
from
jacinto
miles
from
iuka
saying
that
some
of
his
command
had
been
delayed
and
that
the
rear
of
his
column
was
not
yet
up
as
far
as
jacinto
he
said
however
that
he
would
still
be
at
iuka
by
two
the
next
day
i
did
not
believe
this
possible
because
of
the
distance
and
the
condition
of
the
roads
which
was
bad
besides
troops
after
a
forced
march
of
twenty
miles
are
not
in
a
good
condition
for
fighting
the
moment
they
get
through
it
might
do
in
marching
to
relieve
a
beleaguered
garrison
but
not
to
make
an
assault
i
immediately
sent
ord
a
copy
of
rosecrans
dispatch
and
ordered
him
to
be
in
readiness
to
attack
the
moment
he
heard
the
sound
of
guns
to
the
south
or
he
was
instructed
to
notify
his
officers
to
be
on
the
alert
for
any
indications
of
battle
during
the
the
wind
blew
in
the
wrong
direction
to
transmit
sound
either
towards
the
point
where
ord
was
or
to
burnsville
where
i
had
remained
a
couple
of
hours
before
dark
on
the
rosecrans
arrived
with
the
head
of
his
column
at
garnets
the
point
where
the
jacinto
road
to
iuka
leaves
the
road
going
east
he
here
turned
north
without
sending
any
troops
to
the
fulton
road
while
still
moving
in
column
up
the
jacinto
road
he
met
a
force
of
the
enemy
and
had
his
advance
badly
beaten
and
driven
back
upon
the
main
road
in
this
short
engagement
his
loss
was
considerable
for
the
number
engaged
and
one
battery
was
taken
from
him
the
wind
was
still
blowing
hard
and
in
the
wrong
direction
to
transmit
sounds
towards
either
ord
or
me
neither
he
nor
i
nor
any
one
in
either
command
heard
a
gun
that
was
fired
upon
the
after
the
engagement
rosecrans
sent
me
a
dispatch
announcing
the
result
this
was
brought
by
a
courier
there
was
no
road
between
burnsville
and
the
position
then
occupied
by
rosecrans
and
the
country
was
impassable
for
a
man
on
horseback
the
courier
bearing
the
message
was
compelled
to
move
west
nearly
to
jacinto
before
he
found
a
road
leading
to
burnsville
this
made
it
a
late
hour
of
the
night
before
i
learned
of
the
battle
that
had
taken
place
during
the
afternoon
i
at
once
notified
ord
of
the
fact
and
ordered
him
to
attack
early
in
the
morning
the
next
morning
rosecrans
himself
renewed
the
attack
and
went
into
iuka
with
but
little
resistance
ord
also
went
in
according
to
orders
without
hearing
a
gun
from
the
south
of
town
but
supposing
the
troops
coming
from
the
must
be
up
by
that
time
rosecrans
however
had
put
no
troops
upon
the
fulton
road
and
the
enemy
had
taken
advantage
of
this
neglect
and
retreated
by
that
road
during
the
night
word
was
soon
brought
to
me
that
our
troops
were
in
iuka
i
immediately
rode
into
town
and
found
that
the
enemy
was
not
being
pursued
even
by
the
cavalry
i
ordered
pursuit
by
the
whole
of
rosecrans
command
and
went
on
with
him
a
few
miles
in
person
he
followed
only
a
few
miles
after
i
left
him
and
then
went
into
camp
and
the
pursuit
was
continued
no
further
i
was
disappointed
at
the
result
of
the
battle
of
iuka
but
i
had
so
high
an
opinion
of
general
rosecrans
that
i
found
no
fault
at
the
time
chapter
xxix
van
dorn
movements
battle
of
corinth
command
of
the
department
of
the
tennessee
on
the
of
september
general
geo
thomas
was
ordered
east
to
reinforce
buell
this
threw
the
army
at
my
command
still
more
on
the
defensive
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
was
abandoned
except
at
corinth
and
small
forces
were
left
at
chewalla
and
grand
junction
soon
afterwards
the
latter
of
these
two
places
was
given
up
and
bolivar
became
our
most
advanced
position
on
the
mississippi
central
railroad
our
cavalry
was
kept
well
to
the
front
and
frequent
expeditions
were
sent
out
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
enemy
we
were
in
a
country
where
nearly
all
the
people
except
the
negroes
were
hostile
to
us
and
friendly
to
the
cause
we
were
trying
to
suppress
it
was
easy
therefore
for
the
enemy
to
get
early
information
of
our
every
move
we
on
the
contrary
had
to
go
after
our
information
in
force
and
then
often
returned
without
it
on
the
bolivar
was
threatened
by
a
large
force
from
south
of
grand
junction
supposed
to
be
twenty
regiments
of
infantry
with
cavalry
and
artillery
i
reinforced
bolivar
and
went
to
jackson
in
person
to
superintend
the
movement
of
troops
to
whatever
point
the
attack
might
be
made
upon
the
troops
from
corinth
were
brought
up
in
time
to
repel
the
threatened
movement
without
a
battle
our
cavalry
followed
the
enemy
south
of
davis
mills
in
mississippi
on
the
i
found
that
van
dorn
was
apparently
endeavoring
to
strike
the
mississippi
river
above
memphis
at
the
same
time
other
points
within
my
command
were
so
threatened
that
it
was
impossible
to
concentrate
a
force
to
drive
him
away
there
was
at
this
juncture
a
large
union
force
at
helena
arkansas
which
had
it
been
within
my
command
i
could
have
ordered
across
the
river
to
attack
and
break
up
the
mississippi
central
railroad
far
to
the
south
this
would
not
only
have
called
van
dorn
back
but
would
have
compelled
the
retention
of
a
large
rebel
force
far
to
the
south
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
such
raids
on
the
enemy
line
of
supplies
geographical
lines
between
the
commands
during
the
rebellion
were
not
always
well
chosen
or
they
were
too
rigidly
adhered
to
van
dorn
did
not
attempt
to
get
upon
the
line
above
memphis
as
had
apparently
been
his
intention
he
was
simply
covering
a
deeper
design
one
much
more
important
to
his
cause
by
the
of
october
it
was
fully
apparent
that
corinth
was
to
be
attacked
with
great
force
and
determination
and
that
van
dorn
lovell
price
villepigue
and
rust
had
joined
their
strength
for
this
purpose
there
was
some
skirmishing
outside
of
corinth
with
the
advance
of
the
enemy
on
the
the
rebels
massed
in
the
angle
of
the
memphis
and
charleston
and
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroads
and
were
thus
between
the
troops
at
corinth
and
all
possible
reinforcements
any
fresh
troops
for
us
must
come
by
a
circuitous
route
on
the
night
of
the
accordingly
i
ordered
general
mcpherson
who
was
at
jackson
to
join
rosecrans
at
corinth
with
reinforcements
picked
up
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
equal
to
a
brigade
hurlbut
had
been
ordered
from
bolivar
to
march
for
the
same
destination
and
as
van
dorn
was
coming
upon
corinth
from
the
some
of
his
men
fell
in
with
the
advance
of
hurlbut
and
some
skirmishing
ensued
on
the
evening
of
the
on
the
van
dorn
made
a
dashing
attack
hoping
no
doubt
to
capture
rosecrans
before
his
reinforcements
could
come
up
in
that
case
the
enemy
himself
could
have
occupied
the
defences
of
corinth
and
held
at
bay
all
the
union
troops
that
arrived
in
fact
he
could
have
taken
the
offensive
against
the
reinforcements
with
three
or
four
times
their
number
and
still
left
a
sufficient
garrison
in
the
works
about
corinth
to
hold
them
he
came
near
success
some
of
his
troops
penetrating
the
national
lines
at
least
once
but
the
works
that
were
built
after
halleck
departure
enabled
rosecrans
to
hold
his
position
until
the
troops
of
both
mcpherson
and
hurlbut
approached
towards
the
rebel
front
and
rear
the
enemy
was
finally
driven
back
with
great
slaughter
all
their
charges
made
with
great
gallantry
were
repulsed
the
loss
on
our
side
was
heavy
but
nothing
to
compare
with
van
dorn
mcpherson
came
up
with
the
train
of
cars
bearing
his
command
as
close
to
the
enemy
as
was
prudent
debarked
on
the
rebel
flank
and
got
in
to
the
support
of
rosecrans
just
after
the
repulse
his
approach
as
well
as
that
of
hurlbut
was
known
to
the
enemy
and
had
a
moral
effect
general
rosecrans
however
failed
to
follow
up
the
victory
although
i
had
given
specific
orders
in
advance
of
the
battle
for
him
to
pursue
the
moment
the
enemy
was
repelled
he
did
not
do
so
and
i
repeated
the
order
after
the
battle
in
the
first
order
he
was
notified
that
the
force
of
men
which
was
going
to
his
assistance
would
be
in
great
peril
if
the
enemy
was
not
pursued
general
ord
had
joined
hurlbut
on
the
and
being
senior
took
command
of
his
troops
this
force
encountered
the
head
of
van
dorn
retreating
column
just
as
it
was
crossing
the
hatchie
by
a
bridge
some
ten
miles
out
from
corinth
the
bottom
land
here
was
swampy
and
bad
for
the
operations
of
troops
making
a
good
place
to
get
an
enemy
into
ord
attacked
the
troops
that
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
drove
them
back
in
a
panic
many
were
killed
and
others
were
drowned
by
being
pushed
off
the
bridge
in
their
hurried
retreat
ord
followed
and
met
the
main
force
he
was
too
weak
in
numbers
to
assault
but
he
held
the
bridge
and
compelled
the
enemy
to
resume
his
retreat
by
another
bridge
higher
up
the
stream
ord
was
wounded
in
this
engagement
and
the
command
devolved
on
hurlbut
rosecrans
did
not
start
in
pursuit
till
the
morning
of
the
and
then
took
the
wrong
road
moving
in
the
enemy
country
he
travelled
with
a
wagon
train
to
carry
his
provisions
and
munitions
of
war
his
march
was
therefore
slower
than
that
of
the
enemy
who
was
moving
towards
his
supplies
two
or
three
hours
of
pursuit
on
the
day
of
battle
without
anything
except
what
the
men
carried
on
their
persons
would
have
been
worth
more
than
any
pursuit
commenced
the
next
day
could
have
possibly
been
even
when
he
did
start
if
rosecrans
had
followed
the
route
taken
by
the
enemy
he
would
have
come
upon
van
dorn
in
a
swamp
with
a
stream
in
front
and
ord
holding
the
only
bridge
but
he
took
the
road
leading
north
and
towards
chewalla
instead
of
west
and
after
having
marched
as
far
as
the
enemy
had
moved
to
get
to
the
hatchie
he
was
as
far
from
battle
as
when
he
started
hurlbut
had
not
the
numbers
to
meet
any
such
force
as
van
dorn
if
they
had
been
in
any
mood
for
fighting
and
he
might
have
been
in
great
peril
i
now
regarded
the
time
to
accomplish
anything
by
pursuit
as
past
and
after
rosecrans
reached
jonesboro
i
ordered
him
to
return
he
kept
on
to
ripley
however
and
was
persistent
in
wanting
to
go
farther
i
thereupon
ordered
him
to
halt
and
submitted
the
matter
to
the
who
allowed
me
to
exercise
my
judgment
in
the
matter
but
inquired
why
not
pursue
upon
this
i
ordered
rosecrans
back
had
he
gone
much
farther
he
would
have
met
a
greater
force
than
van
dorn
had
at
corinth
and
behind
intrenchments
or
on
chosen
ground
and
the
probabilities
are
he
would
have
lost
his
army
the
battle
of
corinth
was
bloody
our
loss
being
killed
wounded
and
missing
the
enemy
lost
many
more
rosecrans
reported
dead
and
prisoners
we
fought
behind
breastworks
which
accounts
in
some
degree
for
the
disparity
among
the
killed
on
our
side
was
general
hackelman
general
oglesby
was
badly
it
was
for
some
time
supposed
mortally
wounded
i
received
a
congratulatory
letter
from
the
president
which
expressed
also
his
sorrow
for
the
losses
this
battle
was
recognized
by
me
as
being
a
decided
victory
though
not
so
complete
as
i
had
hoped
for
nor
nearly
so
complete
as
i
now
think
was
within
the
easy
grasp
of
the
commanding
officer
at
corinth
since
the
war
it
is
known
that
the
result
as
it
was
was
a
crushing
blow
to
the
enemy
and
felt
by
him
much
more
than
it
was
appreciated
at
the
north
the
battle
relieved
me
from
any
further
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
territory
within
my
jurisdiction
and
soon
after
receiving
reinforcements
i
suggested
to
the
a
forward
movement
against
vicksburg
on
the
of
october
i
learned
of
pemberton
being
in
command
at
holly
springs
and
much
reinforced
by
conscripts
and
troops
from
alabama
and
texas
the
same
day
general
rosecrans
was
relieved
from
duty
with
my
command
and
shortly
after
he
succeeded
buell
in
the
command
of
the
army
in
middle
tennessee
i
was
delighted
at
the
promotion
of
general
rosecrans
to
a
separate
command
because
i
still
believed
that
when
independent
of
an
immediate
superior
the
qualities
which
i
at
that
time
credited
him
with
possessing
would
show
themselves
as
a
subordinate
i
found
that
i
could
not
make
him
do
as
i
wished
and
had
determined
to
relieve
him
from
duty
that
very
day
at
the
close
of
the
operations
just
described
my
force
in
round
numbers
was
of
these
were
in
kentucky
and
illinois
in
memphis
from
mound
city
south
and
at
corinth
general
mcclernand
had
been
authorized
from
washington
to
go
north
and
organize
troops
to
be
used
in
opening
the
mississippi
these
new
levies
with
other
reinforcements
now
began
to
come
in
on
the
of
october
i
was
placed
in
command
of
the
department
of
the
tennessee
reinforcements
continued
to
come
from
the
north
and
by
the
of
november
i
was
prepared
to
take
the
initiative
this
was
a
great
relief
after
the
two
and
a
half
months
of
continued
defence
over
a
large
district
of
country
and
where
nearly
every
citizen
was
an
enemy
ready
to
give
information
of
our
every
move
i
have
described
very
imperfectly
a
few
of
the
battles
and
skirmishes
that
took
place
during
this
time
to
describe
all
would
take
more
space
than
i
can
allot
to
the
purpose
to
make
special
mention
of
all
the
officers
and
troops
who
distinguished
themselves

the
campaign
against

holly
springs
sherman
ordered
to
memphis
sherman
movements
down
the
mississippi
van
dorn
captures
holly
springs
collecting
forage
and
food
vicksburg
was
important
to
the
enemy
because
it
occupied
the
first
high
ground
coming
close
to
the
river
below
memphis
from
there
a
railroad
runs
east
connecting
with
other
roads
leading
to
all
points
of
the
southern
states
a
railroad
also
starts
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
extending
west
as
far
as
shreveport
louisiana
vicksburg
was
the
only
channel
at
the
time
of
the
events
of
which
this
chapter
treats
connecting
the
parts
of
the
confederacy
divided
by
the
mississippi
so
long
as
it
was
held
by
the
enemy
the
free
navigation
of
the
river
was
prevented
hence
its
importance
points
on
the
river
between
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
were
held
as
dependencies
but
their
fall
was
sure
to
follow
the
capture
of
the
former
place
the
campaign
against
vicksburg
commenced
on
the
of
november
as
indicated
in
a
dispatch
to
the
in
the
following
words
i
have
commenced
a
movement
on
grand
junction
with
three
divisions
from
corinth
and
two
from
bolivar
will
leave
here
jackson
tennessee
and
take
command
in
person
if
found
practicable
i
will
go
to
holly
springs
and
may
be
grenada
completing
railroad
and
telegraph
as
i
go
at
this
time
my
command
was
holding
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
from
about
miles
south
of
corinth
north
to
columbus
kentucky
the
mississippi
central
from
bolivar
north
to
its
junction
with
the
mobile
and
ohio
the
memphis
and
charleston
from
corinth
east
to
bear
creek
and
the
mississippi
river
from
cairo
to
memphis
my
entire
command
was
no
more
than
was
necessary
to
hold
these
lines
and
hardly
that
if
kept
on
the
defensive
by
moving
against
the
enemy
and
into
his
unsubdued
or
not
yet
captured
territory
driving
their
army
before
us
these
lines
would
nearly
hold
themselves
thus
affording
a
large
force
for
field
operations
my
moving
force
at
that
time
was
about
men
and
i
estimated
the
enemy
confronting
me
under
pemberton
at
about
the
same
number
general
mcpherson
commanded
my
left
wing
and
general
hamilton
the
centre
while
sherman
was
at
memphis
with
the
right
wing
pemberton
was
fortified
at
the
tallahatchie
but
occupied
holly
springs
and
grand
junction
on
the
mississippi
central
railroad
on
the
we
occupied
grand
junction
and
la
grange
throwing
a
considerable
force
seven
or
eight
miles
south
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
the
road
from
bolivar
forward
was
repaired
and
put
in
running
order
as
the
troops
advanced
up
to
this
time
it
had
been
regarded
as
an
axiom
in
war
that
large
bodies
of
troops
must
operate
from
a
base
of
supplies
which
they
always
covered
and
guarded
in
all
forward
movements
there
was
delay
therefore
in
repairing
the
road
back
and
in
gathering
and
forwarding
supplies
to
the
front
by
my
orders
and
in
accordance
with
previous
instructions
from
washington
all
the
forage
within
reach
was
collected
under
the
supervision
of
the
chief
quartermaster
and
the
provisions
under
the
chief
commissary
receipts
being
given
when
there
was
any
one
to
take
them
the
supplies
in
any
event
to
be
accounted
for
as
government
stores
the
stock
was
bountiful
but
still
it
gave
me
no
idea
of
the
possibility
of
supplying
a
moving
column
in
an
enemy
country
from
the
country
itself
it
was
at
this
point
probably
where
the
first
idea
of
a
bureau
took
its
origin
orders
of
the
government
prohibited
the
expulsion
of
the
negroes
from
the
protection
of
the
army
when
they
came
in
voluntarily
humanity
forbade
allowing
them
to
starve
with
such
an
army
of
them
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
as
had
congregated
about
grand
junction
amounting
to
many
thousands
it
was
impossible
to
advance
there
was
no
special
authority
for
feeding
them
unless
they
were
employed
as
teamsters
cooks
and
pioneers
with
the
army
but
only
young
men
were
suitable
for
such
work
this
labor
would
support
but
a
very
limited
percentage
of
them
the
plantations
were
all
deserted
the
cotton
and
corn
were
ripe
men
women
and
children
above
ten
years
of
age
could
be
employed
in
saving
these
crops
to
do
this
work
with
contrabands
or
to
have
it
done
organization
under
a
competent
chief
was
necessary
on
inquiring
for
such
a
man
chaplain
eaton
now
and
for
many
years
the
very
able
united
states
commissioner
of
education
was
suggested
he
proved
as
efficient
in
that
field
as
he
has
since
done
in
his
present
one
i
gave
him
all
the
assistants
and
guards
he
called
for
we
together
fixed
the
prices
to
be
paid
for
the
negro
labor
whether
rendered
to
the
government
or
to
individuals
the
cotton
was
to
be
picked
from
abandoned
plantations
the
laborers
to
receive
the
stipulated
price
my
recollection
is
twelve
and
a
half
cents
per
pound
for
picking
and
ginning
from
the
quartermaster
he
shipping
the
cotton
north
to
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
citizens
remaining
on
their
plantations
were
allowed
the
privilege
of
having
their
crops
saved
by
freedmen
on
the
same
terms
at
once
the
freedmen
became
the
money
was
not
paid
to
them
directly
but
was
expended
judiciously
and
for
their
benefit
they
gave
me
no
trouble
afterwards
later
the
freedmen
were
engaged
in
cutting
wood
along
the
mississippi
river
to
supply
the
large
number
of
steamers
on
that
stream
a
good
price
was
paid
for
chopping
wood
used
for
the
supply
of
government
steamers
steamers
chartered
and
which
the
government
had
to
supply
with
fuel
those
supplying
their
own
fuel
paid
a
much
higher
price
in
this
way
a
fund
was
created
not
only
sufficient
to
feed
and
clothe
all
old
and
young
male
and
female
but
to
build
them
comfortable
cabins
hospitals
for
the
sick
and
to
supply
them
with
many
comforts
they
had
never
known
before
at
this
stage
of
the
campaign
against
vicksburg
i
was
very
much
disturbed
by
newspaper
rumors
that
general
mcclernand
was
to
have
a
separate
and
independent
command
within
mine
to
operate
against
vicksburg
by
way
of
the
mississippi
river
two
commanders
on
the
same
field
are
always
one
too
many
and
in
this
case
i
did
not
think
the
general
selected
had
either
the
experience
or
the
qualifications
to
fit
him
for
so
important
a
position
i
feared
for
the
safety
of
the
troops
intrusted
to
him
especially
as
he
was
to
raise
new
levies
raw
troops
to
execute
so
important
a
trust
but
on
the
i
received
a
dispatch
from
general
halleck
saying
that
i
had
command
of
all
the
troops
sent
to
my
department
and
authorizing
me
to
fight
the
enemy
where
i
pleased
the
next
day
my
cavalry
was
in
holly
springs
and
the
enemy
fell
back
south
of
the
tallahatchie
holly
springs
i
selected
for
my
depot
of
supplies
and
munitions
of
war
all
of
which
at
that
time
came
by
rail
from
columbus
kentucky
except
the
few
stores
collected
about
la
grange
and
grand
junction
this
was
a
long
line
increasing
in
length
as
we
moved
south
to
maintain
in
an
enemy
country
on
the
of
november
while
i
was
still
at
holly
springs
i
sent
word
to
sherman
to
meet
me
at
columbus
we
were
but
miles
apart
yet
the
most
expeditious
way
for
us
to
meet
was
for
me
to
take
the
rail
to
columbus
and
sherman
a
steamer
for
the
same
place
at
that
meeting
besides
talking
over
my
general
plans
i
gave
him
his
orders
to
join
me
with
two
divisions
and
to
march
them
down
the
mississippi
central
railroad
if
he
could
sherman
who
was
always
prompt
was
up
by
the
to
cottage
hill
ten
miles
north
of
oxford
he
brought
three
divisions
with
him
leaving
a
garrison
of
only
four
regiments
of
infantry
a
couple
of
pieces
of
artillery
and
a
small
detachment
of
cavalry
further
reinforcements
he
knew
were
on
their
way
from
the
north
to
memphis
about
this
time
general
halleck
ordered
troops
from
helena
arkansas
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
was
not
under
my
command
then
to
cut
the
road
in
pemberton
rear
the
expedition
was
under
generals
hovey
and
washburn
and
was
successful
so
far
as
reaching
the
railroad
was
concerned
but
the
damage
done
was
very
slight
and
was
soon
repaired
the
tallahatchie
which
confronted
me
was
very
high
the
railroad
bridge
destroyed
and
pemberton
strongly
fortified
on
the
south
side
a
crossing
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
i
sent
the
cavalry
higher
up
the
stream
and
they
secured
a
crossing
this
caused
the
enemy
to
evacuate
their
position
which
was
possibly
accelerated
by
the
expedition
of
hovey
and
washburn
the
enemy
was
followed
as
far
south
as
oxford
by
the
main
body
of
troops
and
some
seventeen
miles
farther
by
mcpherson
command
here
the
pursuit
was
halted
to
repair
the
railroad
from
the
tallahatchie
northward
in
order
to
bring
up
supplies
the
piles
on
which
the
railroad
bridge
rested
had
been
left
standing
the
work
of
constructing
a
roadway
for
the
troops
was
but
a
short
matter
and
later
rails
were
laid
for
cars
during
the
delay
at
oxford
in
repairing
railroads
i
learned
that
an
expedition
down
the
mississippi
now
was
inevitable
and
desiring
to
have
a
competent
commander
in
charge
i
ordered
sherman
on
the
of
december
back
to
memphis
to
take
charge
the
following
were
his
orders
headquarters
army
corps
department
of
the
tennessee
oxford
mississippi
december
sherman
commanding
right
wing
you
will
proceed
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
to
memphis
tennessee
taking
with
you
one
division
of
your
present
command
on
your
arrival
at
memphis
you
will
assume
command
of
all
the
troops
there
and
that
portion
of
general
curtis
forces
at
present
east
of
the
mississippi
river
and
organize
them
into
brigades
and
divisions
in
your
own
army
as
soon
as
possible
move
with
them
down
the
river
to
the
vicinity
of
vicksburg
and
with
the
of
the
gunboat
fleet
under
command
of
porter
proceed
to
the
reduction
of
that
place
in
such
a
manner
as
circumstances
and
your
own
judgment
may
dictate
the
amount
of
rations
forage
land
transportation
necessary
to
take
will
be
left
entirely
with
yourself
the
quartermaster
at
louis
will
be
instructed
to
send
you
transportation
for
men
should
you
still
find
yourself
deficient
your
quartermaster
will
be
authorized
to
make
up
the
deficiency
from
such
transports
as
may
come
into
the
port
of
memphis
on
arriving
in
memphis
put
yourself
in
communication
with
admiral
porter
and
arrange
with
him
for
his
inform
me
at
the
earliest
practicable
day
of
the
time
when
you
will
embark
and
such
plans
as
may
then
be
matured
i
will
hold
the
forces
here
in
readiness
to
with
you
in
such
manner
as
the
movements
of
the
enemy
may
make
necessary
leave
the
district
of
memphis
in
the
command
of
an
efficient
officer
and
with
a
garrison
of
four
regiments
of
infantry
the
siege
guns
and
whatever
cavalry
may
be
there
grant
this
idea
had
presented
itself
to
my
mind
earlier
for
on
the
of
december
i
asked
halleck
if
it
would
not
be
well
to
hold
the
enemy
south
of
the
yallabusha
and
move
a
force
from
helena
and
memphis
on
vicksburg
on
the
again
i
suggested
from
oxford
to
halleck
that
if
the
helena
troops
were
at
my
command
i
though
it
would
be
possible
to
take
them
and
the
memphis
forces
south
of
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
river
and
thus
secure
vicksburg
and
the
state
of
mississippi
halleck
on
the
same
day
the
of
december
directed
me
not
to
attempt
to
hold
the
country
south
of
the
tallahatchie
but
to
collect
troops
at
memphis
by
the
for
the
vicksburg
expedition
i
sent
sherman
with
two
divisions
at
once
informed
the
of
the
fact
and
asked
whether
i
should
command
the
expedition
down
the
river
myself
or
send
sherman
i
was
authorized
to
do
as
i
though
best
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
object
in
view
i
sent
sherman
and
so
informed
general
halleck
as
stated
my
action
in
sending
sherman
back
was
expedited
by
a
desire
to
get
him
in
command
of
the
forces
separated
from
my
direct
supervision
i
feared
that
delay
might
bring
mcclernand
who
was
his
senior
and
who
had
authority
from
the
president
and
secretary
of
war
to
exercise
that
particular
command
and
independently
i
doubted
mcclernand
fitness
and
i
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
in
forestalling
him
i
was
by
no
means
giving
offence
to
those
whose
authority
to
command
was
above
both
him
and
me
neither
my
orders
to
general
sherman
nor
the
correspondence
between
us
or
between
general
halleck
and
myself
contemplated
at
the
time
my
going
further
south
than
the
yallabusha
pemberton
force
in
my
front
was
the
main
part
of
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
as
the
force
with
me
was
the
defence
of
the
territory
held
by
us
in
west
tennessee
and
kentucky
i
hoped
to
hold
pemberton
in
my
front
while
sherman
should
get
in
his
rear
and
into
vicksburg
the
further
north
the
enemy
could
be
held
the
better
it
was
understood
however
between
general
sherman
and
myself
that
our
movements
were
to
be
if
pemberton
could
not
be
held
away
from
vicksburg
i
was
to
follow
him
but
at
that
time
it
was
not
expected
to
abandon
the
railroad
north
of
the
yallabusha
with
that
point
as
a
secondary
base
of
supplies
the
possibility
of
moving
down
the
yazoo
until
communications
could
be
opened
with
the
mississippi
was
contemplated
it
was
my
intention
and
so
understood
by
sherman
and
his
command
that
if
the
enemy
should
fall
back
i
would
follow
him
even
to
the
gates
of
vicksburg
i
intended
in
such
an
event
to
hold
the
road
to
grenada
on
the
yallabusha
and
cut
loose
from
there
expecting
to
establish
a
new
base
of
supplies
on
the
yazoo
or
at
vicksburg
itself
with
grenada
to
fall
back
upon
in
case
of
failure
it
should
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
i
speak
of
it
had
not
been
demonstrated
that
an
army
could
operate
in
an
enemy
territory
depending
upon
the
country
for
supplies
a
halt
was
called
at
oxford
with
the
advance
seventeen
miles
south
of
there
to
bring
up
the
road
to
the
latter
point
and
to
bring
supplies
of
food
forage
and
munitions
to
the
front
on
the
of
december
i
received
orders
from
washington
to
divide
my
command
into
four
army
corps
with
general
mcclernand
to
command
one
of
them
and
to
be
assigned
to
that
part
of
the
army
which
was
to
operate
down
the
mississippi
this
interfered
with
my
plans
but
probably
resulted
in
my
ultimately
taking
the
command
in
person
mcclernand
was
at
that
time
in
springfield
illinois
the
order
was
obeyed
without
any
delay
dispatches
were
sent
to
him
the
same
day
in
conformity
on
the
general
van
dorn
appeared
at
holly
springs
my
secondary
base
of
supplies
captured
the
garrison
of
men
commanded
by
colonel
murphy
of
the
wisconsin
regiment
and
destroyed
all
our
munitions
of
war
food
and
forage
the
capture
was
a
disgraceful
one
to
the
officer
commanding
but
not
to
the
troops
under
him
at
the
same
time
forrest
got
on
our
line
of
railroad
between
jackson
tennessee
and
columbus
kentucky
doing
much
damage
to
it
this
cut
me
off
from
all
communication
with
the
north
for
more
than
a
week
and
it
was
more
than
two
weeks
before
rations
or
forage
could
be
issued
from
stores
obtained
in
the
regular
way
this
demonstrated
the
impossibility
of
maintaining
so
long
a
line
of
road
over
which
to
draw
supplies
for
an
army
moving
in
an
enemy
country
i
determined
therefore
to
abandon
my
campaign
into
the
interior
with
columbus
as
a
base
and
returned
to
la
grange
and
grand
junction
destroying
the
road
to
my
front
and
repairing
the
road
to
memphis
making
the
mississippi
river
the
line
over
which
to
draw
supplies
pemberton
was
falling
back
at
the
same
time
the
moment
i
received
the
news
of
van
dorn
success
i
sent
the
cavalry
at
the
front
back
to
drive
him
from
the
country
he
had
start
enough
to
move
north
destroying
the
railroad
in
many
places
and
to
attack
several
small
garrisons
intrenched
as
guards
to
the
railroad
all
these
he
found
warned
of
his
coming
and
prepared
to
receive
him
van
dorn
did
not
succeed
in
capturing
a
single
garrison
except
the
one
at
holly
springs
which
was
larger
than
all
the
others
attacked
by
him
put
together
murphy
was
also
warned
of
van
dorn
approach
but
made
no
preparations
to
meet
him
he
did
not
even
notify
his
command
colonel
murphy
was
the
officer
who
two
months
before
had
evacuated
iuka
on
the
approach
of
the
enemy
general
rosecrans
denounced
him
for
the
act
and
desired
to
have
him
tried
and
punished
i
sustained
the
colonel
at
the
time
because
his
command
was
a
small
one
compared
with
that
of
the
enemy
not
as
large
and
i
thought
he
had
done
well
to
get
away
without
falling
into
their
hands
his
leaving
large
stores
to
fall
into
price
possession
i
looked
upon
as
an
oversight
and
excused
it
on
the
ground
of
inexperience
in
military
matters
he
should
however
have
destroyed
them
this
last
surrender
demonstrated
to
my
mind
that
rosecrans
judgment
of
murphy
conduct
at
iuka
was
correct
the
surrender
of
holly
springs
was
most
reprehensible
and
showed
either
the
disloyalty
of
colonel
murphy
to
the
cause
which
he
professed
to
serve
or
gross
cowardice
after
the
war
was
over
i
read
from
the
diary
of
a
lady
who
accompanied
general
pemberton
in
his
retreat
from
the
tallahatchie
that
the
retreat
was
almost
a
panic
the
roads
were
bad
and
it
was
difficult
to
move
the
artillery
and
trains
why
there
should
have
been
a
panic
i
do
not
see
no
expedition
had
yet
started
down
the
mississippi
river
had
i
known
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
enemy
or
the
fact
that
central
mississippi
abounded
so
in
all
army
supplies
i
would
have
been
in
pursuit
of
pemberton
while
his
cavalry
was
destroying
the
roads
in
my
rear
after
sending
cavalry
to
drive
van
dorn
away
my
next
order
was
to
dispatch
all
the
wagons
we
had
under
proper
escort
to
collect
and
bring
in
all
supplies
of
forage
and
food
from
a
region
of
fifteen
miles
east
and
west
of
the
road
from
our
front
back
to
grand
junction
leaving
two
months
supplies
for
the
families
of
those
whose
stores
were
taken
i
was
amazed
at
the
quantity
of
supplies
the
country
afforded
it
showed
that
we
could
have
subsisted
off
the
country
for
two
months
instead
of
two
weeks
without
going
beyond
the
limits
designated
this
taught
me
a
lesson
which
was
taken
advantage
of
later
in
the
campaign
when
our
army
lived
twenty
days
with
the
issue
of
only
five
rations
by
the
commissary
our
loss
of
supplies
was
great
at
holly
springs
but
it
was
more
than
compensated
for
by
those
taken
from
the
country
and
by
the
lesson
taught
the
news
of
the
capture
of
holly
springs
and
the
destruction
of
our
supplies
caused
much
rejoicing
among
the
people
remaining
in
oxford
they
came
with
broad
smiles
on
their
faces
indicating
intense
joy
to
ask
what
i
was
going
to
do
now
without
anything
for
my
soldiers
to
eat
i
told
them
that
i
was
not
disturbed
that
i
had
already
sent
troops
and
wagons
to
collect
all
the
food
and
forage
they
could
find
for
fifteen
miles
on
each
side
of
the
road
countenances
soon
changed
and
so
did
the
inquiry
the
next
was
what
are
we
to
do
my
response
was
that
we
had
endeavored
to
feed
ourselves
from
our
own
northern
resources
while
visiting
them
but
their
friends
in
gray
had
been
uncivil
enough
to
destroy
what
we
had
brought
along
and
it
could
not
be
expected
that
men
with
arms
in
their
hands
would
starve
in
the
midst
of
plenty
i
advised
them
to
emigrate
east
or
west
fifteen
miles
and
assist
in
eating
up
what
we
left

i
was
really
cut
off
from
communication
with
a
great
part
of
my

this

resulted
in

from

arrive
for

the

not
reach
mcclernand
pemberton
got
back
to
vicksburg
before
sherman
got
there
the
rebel
positions
were
on
a
bluff
on
the
yazoo
river
some
miles
above
its
mouth
the
waters
were
high
so
that
the
bottoms
were
generally
overflowed
leaving
only
narrow
causeways
of
dry
land
between
points
of
debarkation
and
the
high
bluffs
these
were
fortified
and
defended
at
all
points
the
rebel
position
was
impregnable
against
any
force
that
could
be
brought
against
its
front
sherman
could
not
use
of
his
force
his
efforts
to
capture
the
city
or
the
high
ground
north
of
it
were
necessarily
unavailing
sherman
attack
was
very
unfortunate
but
i
had
no
opportunity
of
communicating
with
him
after
the
destruction
of
the
road
and
telegraph
to
my
rear
on
the
he
did
not
know
but
what
i
was
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
and
depending
on
him
to
open
a
new
base
of
supplies
for
the
troops
with
me
i
had
before
he
started
from
memphis
directed
him
to
take
with
him
a
few
small
steamers
suitable
for
the
navigation
of
the
yazoo
not
knowing
but
that
i
might
want
them
to
supply
me
after
cutting
loose
from
my
base
at
grenada
on
the
i
removed
my
headquarters
back
to
holly
springs
the
troops
were
drawn
back
gradually
but
without
haste
or
confusion
finding
supplies
abundant
and
no
enemy
following
the
road
was
not
damaged
south
of
holly
springs
by
van
dorn
at
least
not
to
an
extent
to
cause
any
delay
as
i
had
resolved
to
move
headquarters
to
memphis
and
to
repair
the
road
to
that
point
i
remained
at
holly
springs
until
this
work
was
completed
on
the
of
january
the
work
on
the
road
from
holly
springs
to
grand
junction
and
thence
to
memphis
being
completed
i
moved
my
headquarters
to
the
latter
place
during
the
campaign
here
described
the
losses
mostly
captures
were
about
equal
crediting
the
rebels
with
their
holly
springs
capture
which
they
could
not
hold
when
sherman
started
on
his
expedition
down
the
river
he
had
men
taken
from
memphis
and
was
reinforced
by
more
at
helena
arkansas
the
troops
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
had
previously
been
assigned
to
my
command
mcclernand
having
received
the
orders
for
his
assignment
reached
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
on
the
of
january
and
immediately
assumed
command
of
all
the
troops
with
sherman
being
a
part
of
his
own
corps
the
and
all
of
sherman
the
sherman
and
admiral
porter
with
the
fleet
had
withdrawn
from
the
yazoo
after
consultation
they
decided
that
neither
the
army
nor
navy
could
render
service
to
the
cause
where
they
were
and
learning
that
i
had
withdrawn
from
the
interior
of
mississippi
they
determined
to
return
to
the
arkansas
river
and
to
attack
arkansas
post
about
fifty
miles
up
that
stream
and
garrisoned
by
about
five
or
six
thousand
men
sherman
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
this
force
through
a
man
who
had
been
captured
by
the
enemy
with
a
steamer
loaded
with
ammunition
and
other
supplies
intended
for
his
command
the
man
had
made
his
escape
mcclernand
approved
this
move
reluctantly
as
sherman
says
no
obstacle
was
encountered
until
the
gunboats
and
transports
were
within
range
of
the
fort
after
three
days
bombardment
by
the
navy
an
assault
was
made
by
the
troops
and
marines
resulting
in
the
capture
of
the
place
and
in
taking
prisoners
and
guns
i
was
at
first
disposed
to
disapprove
of
this
move
as
an
unnecessary
side
movement
having
no
especial
bearing
upon
the
work
before
us
but
when
the
result
was
understood
i
regarded
it
as
very
important
five
thousand
confederate
troops
left
in
the
rear
might
have
caused
us
much
trouble
and
loss
of
property
while
navigating
the
mississippi
immediately
after
the
reduction
of
arkansas
post
and
the
capture
of
the
garrison
mcclernand
returned
with
his
entire
force
to
napoleon
at
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
from
here
i
received
messages
from
both
sherman
and
admiral
porter
urging
me
to
come
and
take
command
in
person
and
expressing
their
distrust
of
mcclernand
ability
and
fitness
for
so
important
and
intricate
an
expedition
on
the
i
visited
mcclernand
and
his
command
at
napoleon
it
was
here
made
evident
to
me
that
both
the
army
and
navy
were
so
distrustful
of
mcclernand
fitness
to
command
that
while
they
would
do
all
they
could
to
insure
success
this
distrust
was
an
element
of
weakness
it
would
have
been
criminal
to
send
troops
under
these
circumstances
into
such
danger
by
this
time
i
had
received
authority
to
relieve
mcclernand
or
to
assign
any
person
else
to
the
command
of
the
river
expedition
or
to
assume
command
in
person
i
felt
great
embarrassment
about
mcclernand
he
was
the
senior
after
myself
within
the
department
it
would
not
do
with
his
rank
and
ambition
to
assign
a
junior
over
him
nothing
was
left
therefore
but
to
assume
the
command
myself
i
would
have
been
glad
to
put
sherman
in
command
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
what
he
had
failed
in
the
december
before
but
there
seemed
no
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
for
he
was
junior
to
mcclernand
sherman
failure
needs
no
apology
on
the
i
ordered
general
mcclernand
with
the
entire
command
to
young
point
and
milliken
bend
while
i
returned
to
memphis
to
make
all
the
necessary
preparation
for
leaving
the
territory
behind
me
secure
general
hurlbut
with
the
corps
was
left
in
command
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
was
held
while
the
mississippi
central
was
given
up
columbus
was
the
only
point
between
cairo
and
memphis
on
the
river
left
with
a
garrison
all
the
troops
and
guns
from
the
posts
on
the
abandoned
railroad
and
river
were
sent
to
the
front
on
the
of
january
i
arrived
at
young
point
and
assumed
command
the
following
day
general
mcclernand
took
exception
in
a
most
characteristic
way
for
him
his
correspondence
with
me
on
the
subject
was
more
in
the
nature
of
a
reprimand
than
a
protest
it
was
highly
insubordinate
but
i
overlooked
it
as
i
believed
for
the
good
of
the
service
general
mcclernand
was
a
politician
of
very
considerable
prominence
in
his
state
he
was
a
member
of
congress
when
the
secession
war
broke
out
he
belonged
to
that
political
party
which
furnished
all
the
opposition
there
was
to
a
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
war
for
saving
the
union
there
was
no
delay
in
his
declaring
himself
for
the
union
at
all
hazards
and
there
was
no
uncertain
sound
in
his
declaration
of
where
he
stood
in
the
contest
before
the
country
he
also
gave
up
his
seat
in
congress
to
take
the
field
in
defence
of
the
principles
he
had
proclaimed
the
real
work
of
the
campaign
and
siege
of
vicksburg
now
began
the
problem
was
to
secure
a
footing
upon
dry
ground
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
from
which
the
troops
could
operate
against
vicksburg
the
mississippi
river
from
cairo
south
runs
through
a
rich
alluvial
valley
of
many
miles
in
width
bound
on
the
east
by
land
running
from
eighty
up
to
two
or
more
hundred
feet
above
the
river
on
the
west
side
the
highest
land
except
in
a
few
places
is
but
little
above
the
highest
water
through
this
valley
the
river
meanders
in
the
most
tortuous
way
varying
in
direction
to
all
points
of
the
compass
at
places
it
runs
to
the
very
foot
of
the
bluffs
after
leaving
memphis
there
are
no
such
highlands
coming
to
the
water
edge
on
the
east
shore
until
vicksburg
is
reached
the
intervening
land
is
cut
up
by
bayous
filled
from
the
river
in
high
water
many
of
them
navigable
for
steamers
all
of
them
would
be
except
for
overhanging
trees
narrowness
and
tortuous
course
making
it
impossible
to
turn
the
bends
with
vessels
of
any
considerable
length
marching
across
this
country
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
was
impossible
navigating
it
proved
equally
impracticable
the
strategical
way
according
to
the
rule
therefore
would
have
been
to
go
back
to
memphis
establish
that
as
a
base
of
supplies
fortify
it
so
that
the
storehouses
could
be
held
by
a
small
garrison
and
move
from
there
along
the
line
of
railroad
repairing
as
we
advanced
to
the
yallabusha
or
to
jackson
mississippi
at
this
time
the
north
had
become
very
much
discouraged
many
strong
union
men
believed
that
the
war
must
prove
a
failure
the
elections
of
had
gone
against
the
party
which
was
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
to
save
the
union
if
it
took
the
last
man
and
the
last
dollar
voluntary
enlistments
had
ceased
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
north
and
the
draft
had
been
resorted
to
to
fill
up
our
ranks
it
was
my
judgment
at
the
time
that
to
make
a
backward
movement
as
long
as
that
from
vicksburg
to
memphis
would
be
interpreted
by
many
of
those
yet
full
of
hope
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
as
a
defeat
and
that
the
draft
would
be
resisted
desertions
ensue
and
the
power
to
capture
and
punish
deserters
lost
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done
but
to
go
forward
to
a
decisive
victory
this
was
in
my
mind
from
the
moment
i
took
command
in
person
at
young
point
the
winter
of
was
a
noted
one
for
continuous
high
water
in
the
mississippi
and
for
heavy
rains
along
the
lower
river
to
get
dry
land
or
rather
land
above
the
water
to
encamp
the
troops
upon
took
many
miles
of
river
front
we
had
to
occupy
the
levees
and
the
ground
immediately
behind
this
was
so
limited
that
one
corps
the
under
general
mcpherson
was
at
lake
providence
seventy
miles
above
vicksburg
it
was
in
january
the
troops
took
their
position
opposite
vicksburg
the
water
was
very
high
and
the
rains
were
incessant
there
seemed
no
possibility
of
a
land
movement
before
the
end
of
march
or
later
and
it
would
not
do
to
lie
idle
all
this
time
the
effect
would
be
demoralizing
to
the
troops
and
injurious
to
their
health
friends
in
the
north
would
have
grown
more
and
more
discouraged
and
enemies
in
the
same
section
more
and
more
insolent
in
their
gibes
and
denunciation
of
the
cause
and
those
engaged
in
it
i
always
admired
the
south
as
bad
as
i
thought
their
cause
for
the
boldness
with
which
they
silenced
all
opposition
and
all
croaking
by
press
or
by
individuals
within
their
control
war
at
all
times
whether
a
civil
war
between
sections
of
a
common
country
or
between
nations
ought
to
be
avoided
if
possible
with
honor
but
once
entered
into
it
is
too
much
for
human
nature
to
tolerate
an
enemy
within
their
ranks
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
armies
of
the
opposing
section
or
nation
vicksburg
as
stated
before
is
on
the
first
high
land
coming
to
the
river
edge
below
that
on
which
memphis
stands
the
bluff
or
high
land
follows
the
left
bank
of
the
yazoo
for
some
distance
and
continues
in
a
southerly
direction
to
the
mississippi
river
thence
it
runs
along
the
mississippi
to
warrenton
six
miles
below
the
yazoo
river
leaves
the
high
land
a
short
distance
below
haines
bluff
and
empties
into
the
mississippi
nine
miles
above
vicksburg
vicksburg
is
built
on
this
high
land
where
the
mississippi
washes
the
base
of
the
hill
haines
bluff
eleven
miles
from
vicksburg
on
the
yazoo
river
was
strongly
fortified
the
whole
distance
from
there
to
vicksburg
and
thence
to
warrenton
was
also
intrenched
with
batteries
at
suitable
distances
and
connecting
them
from
young
point
the
mississippi
turns
in
a
direction
to
a
point
just
above
the
city
when
it
again
turns
and
runs
leaving
vessels
which
might
attempt
to
run
the
blockade
exposed
to
the
fire
of
batteries
six
miles
below
the
city
before
they
were
in
range
of
the
upper
batteries
since
then
the
river
has
made
a
leaving
what
was
the
peninsula
in
front
of
the
city
an
island
north
of
the
yazoo
was
all
a
marsh
heavily
timbered
cut
up
with
bayous
and
much
overflowed
a
front
attack
was
therefore
impossible
and
was
never
contemplated
certainly
not
by
me
the
problem
then
became
how
to
secure
a
landing
on
high
ground
east
of
the
mississippi
without
an
apparent
retreat
then
commenced
a
series
of
experiments
to
consume
time
and
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
enemy
of
my
troops
and
of
the
public
generally
i
myself
never
felt
great
confidence
that
any
of
the
experiments
resorted
to
would
prove
successful
nevertheless
i
was
always
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
them
in
case
they
did
in
general
thomas
williams
had
come
up
from
new
orleans
and
cut
a
ditch
ten
or
twelve
feet
wide
and
about
as
deep
straight
across
from
young
point
to
the
river
below
the
distance
across
was
a
little
over
a
mile
it
was
williams
expectation
that
when
the
river
rose
it
would
cut
a
navigable
channel
through
but
the
canal
started
in
an
eddy
from
both
ends
and
of
course
it
only
filled
up
with
water
on
the
rise
without
doing
any
execution
in
the
way
of
cutting
lincoln
had
navigated
the
mississippi
in
his
younger
days
and
understood
well
its
tendency
to
change
its
channel
in
places
from
time
to
time
he
set
much
store
accordingly
by
this
canal
general
mcclernand
had
been
therefore
directed
before
i
went
to
young
point
to
push
the
work
of
widening
and
deepening
this
canal
after
my
arrival
the
work
was
diligently
pushed
with
about
men
as
many
as
could
be
used
to
advantage
until
interrupted
by
a
sudden
rise
in
the
river
that
broke
a
dam
at
the
upper
end
which
had
been
put
there
to
keep
the
water
out
until
the
excavation
was
completed
this
was
on
the
of
march
even
if
the
canal
had
proven
a
success
so
far
as
to
be
navigable
for
steamers
it
could
not
have
been
of
much
advantage
to
us
it
runs
in
a
direction
almost
perpendicular
to
the
line
of
bluffs
on
the
opposite
side
or
east
bank
of
the
river
as
soon
as
the
enemy
discovered
what
we
were
doing
he
established
a
battery
commanding
the
canal
throughout
its
length
this
battery
soon
drove
out
our
dredges
two
in
number
which
were
doing
the
work
of
thousands
of
men
had
the
canal
been
completed
it
might
have
proven
of
some
use
in
running
transports
through
under
the
cover
of
night
to
use
below
but
they
would
yet
have
to
run
batteries
though
for
a
much
shorter
distance
while
this
work
was
progressing
we
were
busy
in
other
directions
trying
to
find
an
available
landing
on
high
ground
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
or
to
make
to
get
below
the
city
avoiding
the
batteries
on
the
of
january
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
the
front
i
ordered
general
mcpherson
stationed
with
his
corps
at
lake
providence
to
cut
the
levee
at
that
point
if
successful
in
opening
a
channel
for
navigation
by
this
route
it
would
carry
us
to
the
mississippi
river
through
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
just
above
port
hudson
and
four
hundred
miles
below
vicksburg
by
the
river
lake
providence
is
a
part
of
the
old
bed
of
the
mississippi
about
a
mile
from
the
present
channel
it
is
six
miles
long
and
has
its
outlet
through
bayou
baxter
bayou
macon
and
the
tensas
washita
and
red
rivers
the
last
three
are
navigable
streams
at
all
seasons
bayous
baxter
and
macon
are
narrow
and
tortuous
and
the
banks
are
covered
with
dense
forests
overhanging
the
channel
they
were
also
filled
with
fallen
timber
the
accumulation
of
years
the
land
along
the
mississippi
river
from
memphis
down
is
in
all
instances
highest
next
to
the
river
except
where
the
river
washes
the
bluffs
which
form
the
boundary
of
the
valley
through
which
it
winds
bayou
baxter
as
it
reaches
lower
land
begins
to
spread
out
and
disappears
entirely
in
a
cypress
swamp
before
it
reaches
the
macon
there
was
about
two
feet
of
water
in
this
swamp
at
the
time
to
get
through
it
even
with
vessels
of
the
lightest
draft
it
was
necessary
to
clear
off
a
belt
of
heavy
timber
wide
enough
to
make
a
passage
way
as
the
trees
would
have
to
be
cut
close
to
the
bottom
under
water
it
was
an
undertaking
of
great
magnitude
on
the
of
february
i
visited
general
mcpherson
and
remained
with
him
several
days
the
work
had
not
progressed
so
far
as
to
admit
the
water
from
the
river
into
the
lake
but
the
troops
had
succeeded
in
drawing
a
small
steamer
of
probably
not
over
thirty
tons
capacity
from
the
river
into
the
lake
with
this
we
were
able
to
explore
the
lake
and
bayou
as
far
as
cleared
i
saw
then
that
there
was
scarcely
a
chance
of
this
ever
becoming
a
practicable
route
for
moving
troops
through
an
enemy
country
the
distance
from
lake
providence
to
the
point
where
vessels
going
by
that
route
would
enter
the
mississippi
again
is
about
four
hundred
and
seventy
miles
by
the
main
river
the
distance
would
probably
be
greater
by
the
tortuous
bayous
through
which
this
new
route
would
carry
us
the
enemy
held
port
hudson
below
where
the
red
river
debouches
and
all
the
mississippi
above
to
vicksburg
the
red
river
washita
and
tensas
were
as
has
been
said
all
navigable
streams
on
which
the
enemy
could
throw
small
bodies
of
men
to
obstruct
our
passage
and
pick
off
our
troops
with
their
sharpshooters
i
let
the
work
go
on
believing
employment
was
better
than
idleness
for
the
men
then
too
it
served
as
a
cover
for
other
efforts
which
gave
a
better
prospect
of
success
this
work
was
abandoned
after
the
canal
proved
a
failure
wilson
of
my
staff
was
sent
to
helena
arkansas
to
examine
and
open
a
way
through
moon
lake
and
the
yazoo
pass
if
possible
formerly
there
was
a
route
by
way
of
an
inlet
from
the
mississippi
river
into
moon
lake
a
mile
east
of
the
river
thence
east
through
yazoo
pass
to
coldwater
along
the
latter
to
the
tallahatchie
which
joins
the
yallabusha
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
moon
lake
and
forms
the
yazoo
river
these
were
formerly
navigated
by
steamers
trading
with
the
rich
plantations
along
their
banks
but
the
state
of
mississippi
had
built
a
strong
levee
across
the
inlet
some
years
before
leaving
the
only
entrance
for
vessels
into
this
rich
region
the
one
by
way
of
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
several
hundreds
of
miles
below
on
the
of
february
this
dam
or
levee
was
cut
the
river
being
high
the
rush
of
water
through
the
cut
was
so
great
that
in
a
very
short
time
the
entire
obstruction
was
washed
away
the
bayous
were
soon
filled
and
much
of
the
country
was
overflowed
this
pass
leaves
the
mississippi
river
but
a
few
miles
below
helena
on
the
general
ross
with
his
brigade
of
about
men
on
transports
moved
into
this
new
the
rebels
had
obstructed
the
navigation
of
yazoo
pass
and
the
coldwater
by
felling
trees
into
them
much
of
the
timber
in
this
region
being
of
greater
specific
gravity
than
water
and
being
of
great
size
their
removal
was
a
matter
of
great
labor
but
it
was
finally
accomplished
and
on
the
of
march
ross
found
himself
accompanied
by
two
gunboats
under
the
command
of
watson
smith
confronting
a
fortification
at
greenwood
where
the
tallahatchie
and
yallabusha
unite
and
the
yazoo
begins
the
bends
of
the
rivers
are
such
at
this
point
as
to
almost
form
an
island
scarcely
above
water
at
that
stage
of
the
river
this
island
was
fortified
and
manned
it
was
named
fort
pemberton
after
the
commander
at
vicksburg
no
land
approach
was
accessible
the
troops
therefore
could
render
no
assistance
towards
an
assault
further
than
to
establish
a
battery
on
a
little
piece
of
ground
which
was
discovered
above
water
the
gunboats
however
attacked
on
the
and
again
on
the
of
march
both
efforts
were
failures
and
were
not
renewed
one
gunboat
was
disabled
and
we
lost
six
men
killed
and
wounded
the
loss
of
the
enemy
was
less
fort
pemberton
was
so
little
above
the
water
that
it
was
thought
that
a
rise
of
two
feet
would
drive
the
enemy
out
in
hope
of
enlisting
the
elements
on
our
side
which
had
been
so
much
against
us
up
to
this
time
a
second
cut
was
made
in
the
mississippi
levee
this
time
directly
opposite
helena
or
six
miles
above
the
former
cut
it
did
not
accomplish
the
desired
result
and
ross
with
his
fleet
started
back
on
the
he
met
quinby
with
a
brigade
at
yazoo
pass
quinby
was
the
senior
of
ross
and
assumed
command
he
was
not
satisfied
with
returning
to
his
former
position
without
seeing
for
himself
whether
anything
could
be
accomplished
accordingly
fort
pemberton
was
revisited
by
our
troops
but
an
inspection
was
sufficient
this
time
without
an
attack
quinby
with
his
command
returned
with
but
little
delay
in
the
meantime
i
was
much
exercised
for
the
safety
of
ross
not
knowing
that
quinby
had
been
able
to
join
him
reinforcements
were
of
no
use
in
a
country
covered
with
water
as
they
would
have
to
remain
on
board
of
their
transports
relief
had
to
come
from
another
quarter
so
i
determined
to
get
into
the
yazoo
below
fort
pemberton
steel
bayou
empties
into
the
yazoo
river
between
haines
bluff
and
its
mouth
it
is
narrow
very
tortuous
and
fringed
with
a
very
heavy
growth
of
timber
but
it
is
deep
it
approaches
to
within
one
mile
of
the
mississippi
at
eagle
bend
thirty
miles
above
young
point
steel
bayou
connects
with
black
bayou
black
bayou
with

with
rolling
fork
rolling

with
the
big
sunflower
river
and
the
big
sunflower
with
the
yazoo
river
about
ten
miles
above
bluff
in
a
right
line
but
probably
twenty
or
miles
by
the
winding
of
the
river
all
these
waterways
are
of
about
the
same
nature
so
far
as
navigation
is
concerned
until
the
sunflower
is
reached
this
affords
free
navigation
admiral
porter
explored
this
waterway
as
far
as
deer
creek
on
the
of
march
and
reported
it
navigable
on
the
next
day
he
started
with
five
gunboats
and
four
i
went
with
him
for
some
distance
the
heavy
overhanging
timber
retarded
progress
very
much
as
did
also
the
short
turns
in
so
narrow
a
stream
the
gunboats
however
ploughed
their
way
through
without
other
damage
than
to
their
appearance
the
transports
did
not
fare
so
well
although
they
followed
behind
the
road
was
somewhat
cleared
for
them
by
the
gunboats
in
the
evening
i
returned
to
headquarters
to
hurry
up
reinforcements
sherman
went
in
person
on
the
taking
with
him
stuart
division
of
the
corps
they
took
large
river
transports
to
eagle
bend
on
the
mississippi
where
they
debarked
and
marched
across
to
steel
bayou
where
they
on
the
transports
the
river
steamers
with
their
tall
smokestacks
and
light
guards
extending
out
were
so
much
impeded
that
the
gunboats
got
far
ahead
porter
with
his
fleet
got
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
where
the
sailing
would
have
been
clear
and
free
from
the
obstructions
caused
by
felling
trees
into
the
water
when
he
encountered
rebel
and
his
progress
was
delayed
by
obstructions
in
his
front
he
could
do
nothing
with
gunboats
against
sharpshooters
the
rebels
learning
his
route
had
sent
in
about
men
many
more
than
there
were
sailors
in
the
fleet
sherman
went
back
at
the
request
of
the
admiral
to
clear
out
black
bayou
and
to
hurry
up
reinforcements
which
were
far
behind
on
the
night
of
the
he
received
notice
from
the
admiral
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
and
was
in
imminent
peril
sherman
at
once
returned
through
black
bayou
in
a
canoe
and
passed
on
until
he
met
a
steamer
with
the
last
of
the
reinforcements
he
had
coming
up
they
tried
to
force
their
way
through
black
bayou
with
their
steamer
but
finding
it
slow
and
tedious
work
debarked
and
pushed
forward
on
foot
it
was
night
when
they
landed
and
intensely
dark
there
was
but
a
narrow
strip
of
land
above
water
and
that
was
grown
up
with
underbrush
or
cane
the
troops
lighted
their
way
through
this
with
candles
carried
in
their
hands
for
a
mile
and
a
half
when
they
came
to
an
open
plantation
here
the
troops
rested
until
morning
they
made
miles
from
this
by
noon
the
next
day
and
were
in
time
to
rescue
the
fleet
porter
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
blow
up
the
gunboats
rather
than
have
them
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
more
welcome
visitors
he
probably
never
met
than
the
boys
in
blue
on
this
occasion
the
vessels
were
backed
out
and
returned
to
their
rendezvous
on
the
mississippi
and
thus
ended
in
failure

fourth

the

to
make

miles
above

the
mississippi
levee
cuts
the
supply
of
water
off
from
these
bayous
or
channels
but
all
the
rainfall
behind
the
levee
at
these
points
is
carried
through
these
same
channels
to
the
river
below
in
case
of
a
crevasse
in
this
vicinity
the
water
escaping
would
find
its
outlet
through
the
same
channels
the
dredges
and
laborers
from
the
canal
having
been
driven
out
by
overflow
and
the
enemy
batteries
i
determined
to
open
these
other
channels
if
possible
if
successful
the
effort
would
afford
a
route
away
from
the
enemy
batteries
for
our
transports
there
was
a
good
road
back
of
the
levees
along
these
bayous
to
carry
the
troops
artillery
and
wagon
trains
over
whenever
the
water
receded
a
little
and
after
a
few
days
of
dry
weather
accordingly
with
the
abandonment
of
all
the
other
plans
for
reaching
a
base
heretofore
described
this
new
one
was
undertaken
as
early
as
the
of
february
i
had
written
to
halleck
about
this
route
stating
that
i
thought
it
much
more
practicable
than
the
other
undertaking
the
lake
providence
route
and
that
it
would
have
been
accomplished
with
much
less
labor
if
commenced
before
the
water
had
got
all
over
the
country
the
upper
end
of
these
bayous
being
cut
off
from
a
water
supply
further
than
the
rainfall
back
of
the
levees
was
grown
up
with
dense
timber
for
a
distance
of
several
miles
from
their
source
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
clear
this
out
before
letting
in
the
water
from
the
river
this
work
was
continued
until
the
waters
of
the
river
began
to
recede
and
the
road
to
richmond
louisiana
emerged
from
the
water
one
small
steamer
and
some
barges
were
got
through
this
channel
but
no
further
use
could
be
made
of
it
because
of
the
fall
in
the
river
beyond
this
it
was
no
more
successful
than
the
other
experiments
with
which
the
winter
was
whiled
away
all
these
failures
would
have
been
very
discouraging
if
i
had
expected
much
from
the
efforts
but
i
had
not
from
the
first
the
most
i
hoped
to
accomplish
was
the
passage
of
transports
to
be
used
below
vicksburg
without
exposure
to
the
long
line
of
batteries
defending
that
city
this
long
dreary
and
for
heavy
and
continuous
rains
and
high
water
unprecedented
winter
was
one
of
great
hardship
to
all
engaged
about
vicksburg
the
river
was
higher
than
its
natural
banks
from
december
to
the
following
april
the
war
had
suspended
peaceful
pursuits
in
the
south
further
than
the
production
of
army
supplies
and
in
consequence
the
levees
were
neglected
and
broken
in
many
places
and
the
whole
country
was
covered
with
water
troops
could
scarcely
find
dry
ground
on
which
to
pitch
their
tents
malarial
fevers
broke
out
among
the
men
measles
and
also
attacked
them
the
hospital
arrangements
and
medical
attendance
were
so
perfect
however
that
the
loss
of
life
was
much
less
than
might
have
been
expected
visitors
to
the
camps
went
home
with
dismal
stories
to
relate
northern
papers
came
back
to
the
soldiers
with
these
stories
exaggerated
because
i
would
not
divulge
my
ultimate
plans
to
visitors
they
pronounced
me
idle
incompetent
and
unfit
to
command
men
in
an
emergency
and
clamored
for
my
removal
they
were
not
to
be
satisfied
many
of
them
with
my
simple
removal
but
named
who
my
successor
should
be
mcclernand
fremont
hunter
and
mcclellan
were
all
mentioned
in
this
connection
i
took
no
steps
to
answer
these
complaints
but
continued
to
do
my
duty
as
i
understood
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
every
one
has
his
superstitions
one
of
mine
is
that
in
positions
of
great
responsibility
every
one
should
do
his
duty
to
the
best
of
his
ability
where
assigned
by
competent
authority
without
application
or
the
use
of
influence
to
change
his
position
while
at
cairo
i
had
watched
with
very
great
interest
the
operations
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
looking
upon
that
as
the
main
field
of
the
war
i
had
no
idea
myself
of
ever
having
any
large
command
nor
did
i
suppose
that
i
was
equal
to
one
but
i
had
the
vanity
to
think
that
as
a
cavalry
officer
i
might
succeed
very
well
in
the
command
of
a
brigade
on
one
occasion
in
talking
about
this
to
my
staff
officers
all
of
whom
were
civilians
without
any
military
education
whatever
i
said
that
i
would
give
anything
if
i
were
commanding
a
brigade
of
cavalry
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
i
believed
i
could
do
some
good
captain
hillyer
spoke
up
and
suggested
that
i
make
application
to
be
transferred
there
to
command
the
cavalry
i
then
told
him
that
i
would
cut
my
right
arm
off
first
and
mentioned
this
superstition
in
time
of
war
the
president
being
by
the
constitution
of
the
army
and
navy
is
responsible
for
the
selection
of
commanders
he
should
not
be
embarrassed
in
making
his
selections
i
having
been
selected
my
responsibility
ended
with
my
doing
the
best
i
knew
how
if
i
had
sought
the
place
or
obtained
it
through
personal
or
political
influence
my
belief
is
that
i
would
have
feared
to
undertake
any
plan
of
my
own
conception
and
would
probably
have
awaited
direct
orders
from
my
distant
superiors
persons
obtaining
important
commands
by
application
or
political
influence
are
apt
to
keep
a
written
record
of
complaints
and
predictions
of
defeat
which
are
shown
in
case
of
disaster
somebody
must
be
responsible
for
their
failures
with
all
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
them
both
president
lincoln
and
general
halleck
stood
by
me
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
i
had
never
met
lincoln
but
his
support
was
constant
at
last
the
waters
began
to
recede
the
roads
crossing
the
peninsula
behind
the
levees
of
the
bayous
were
emerging
from
the
waters
the
troops
were
all
concentrated
from
distant
points
at
milliken
bend
preparatory
to
a
final
move
which
was
to
crown
the
long
tedious
and
discouraging
labors
with
success
i
had
had
in
contemplation
the
whole
winter
the
movement
by
land
to
a
point
below
vicksburg
from
which
to
operate
subject
only
to
the
possible
but
not
expected
success
of
some
one
of
the
expedients
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
giving
us
a
different
base
this
could
not
be
undertaken
until
the
waters
receded
i
did
not
therefore
communicate
this
plan
even
to
an
officer
of
my
staff
until
it
was
necessary
to
make
preparations
for
the
start
my
recollection
is
that
admiral
porter
was
the
first
one
to
whom
i
mentioned
it
the
of
the
navy
was
absolutely
essential
to
the
success
even
to
the
contemplation
of
such
an
enterprise
i
had
no
more
authority
to
command
porter
than
he
had
to
command
me
it
was
necessary
to
have
part
of
his
fleet
below
vicksburg
if
the
troops
went
there
steamers
to
use
as
ferries
were
also
essential
the
navy
was
the
only
escort
and
protection
for
these
steamers
all
of
which
in
getting
below
had
to
run
about
fourteen
miles
of
batteries
porter
fell
into
the
plan
at
once
and
suggested
that
he
had
better
superintend
the
preparation
of
the
steamers
selected
to
run
the
batteries
as
sailors
would
probably
understand
the
work
better
than
soldiers
i
was
glad
to
accept
his
proposition
not
only
because
i
admitted
his
argument
but
because
it
would
enable
me
to
keep
from
the
enemy
a
little
longer
our
designs
porter
fleet
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
above
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
entirely
concealed
from
the
enemy
by
the
dense
forests
that
intervened
even
spies
could
not
get
near
him
on
account
of
the
undergrowth
and
overflowed
lands
suspicions
of
some
mysterious
movements
were
aroused
our
river
guards
discovered
one
day
a
small
skiff
moving
quietly
and
mysteriously
up
the
river
near
the
east
shore
from
the
direction
of
vicksburg
towards
the
fleet
on
overhauling
the
boat
they
found
a
small
white
flag
not
much
larger
than
a
handkerchief
set
up
in
the
stern
no
doubt
intended
as
a
flag
of
truce
in
case
of
discovery
the
boat
crew
and
passengers
were
brought
ashore
to
me
the
chief
personage
aboard
proved
to
be
jacob
thompson
secretary
of
the
interior
under
the
administration
of
president
buchanan
after
a
pleasant
conversation
of
half
an
hour
or
more
i
allowed
the
boat
and
crew
passengers
and
all
to
return
to
vicksburg
without
creating
a
suspicion
that
there
was
a
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
the
good
faith
of
thompson
and
his
flag
admiral
porter
proceeded
with
the
preparation
of
the
steamers
for
their
hazardous
passage
of
the
enemy
batteries
the
great
essential
was
to
protect
the
boilers
from
the
enemy
shot
and
to
conceal
the
fires
under
the
boilers
from
view
this
he
accomplished
by
loading
the
steamers
between
the
guards
and
boilers
on
the
boiler
deck
up
to
the
deck
above
with
bales
of
hay
and
cotton
and
the
deck
in
front
of
the
boilers
in
the
same
way
adding
sacks
of
grain
the
hay
and
grain
would
be
wanted
below
and
could
not
be
transported
in
sufficient
quantity
by
the
muddy
roads
over
which
we
expected
to
march
before
this
i
had
been
collecting
from
louis
and
chicago
yawls
and
barges
to
be
used
as
ferries
when
we
got
below
by
the
of
april
porter
was
ready
to
start
on
his
perilous
trip
the
advance
flagship
benton
porter
commanding
started
at
ten
at
night
followed
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
by
the
lafayette
with
a
captured
steamer
the
price
lashed
to
her
side
the
louisville
mound
city
pittsburgh
and
carondelet
all
of
these
being
naval
vessels
next
came
the
transports
forest
queen
silver
wave
and
henry
clay
each
towing
barges
loaded
with
coal
to
be
used
as
fuel
by
the
naval
and
transport
steamers
when
below
the
batteries
the
gunboat
tuscumbia
brought
up
the
rear
soon
after
the
start
a
battery
between
vicksburg
and
warrenton
opened
fire
across
the
intervening
peninsula
followed
by
the
upper
batteries
and
then
by
batteries
all
along
the
line
the
gunboats
ran
up
close
under
the
bluffs
delivering
their
fire
in
return
at
short
distances
probably
without
much
effect
they
were
under
fire
for
more
than
two
hours
and
every
vessel
was
struck
many
times
but
with
little
damage
to
the
gunboats
the
transports
did
not
fare
so
well
the
henry
clay
was
disabled
and
deserted
by
her
crew
soon
after
a
shell
burst
in
the
cotton
packed
about
the
boilers
set
the
vessel
on
fire
and
burned
her
to
the
water
edge
the
burning
mass
however
floated
down
to
carthage
before
grounding
as
did
also
one
of
the
barges
in
tow
the
enemy
were
evidently
expecting
our
fleet
for
they
were
ready
to
light
up
the
river
by
means
of
bonfires
on
the
east
side
and
by
firing
houses
on
the
point
of
land
opposite
the
city
on
the
louisiana
side
the
sight
was
magnificent
but
terrible
i
witnessed
it
from
the
deck
of
a
river
transport
run
out
into
the
middle
of
the
river
and
as
low
down
as
it
was
prudent
to
go
my
mind
was
much
relieved
when
i
learned
that
no
one
on
the
transports
had
been
killed
and
but
few
if
any
wounded
during
the
running
of
the
batteries
men
were
stationed
in
the
holds
of
the
transports
to
partially
stop
with
cotton
that
might
be
made
in
the
hulls
all
damage
was
afterwards
soon
repaired
under
the
direction
of
admiral
porter
the
experiment
of
passing
batteries
had
been
tried
before
this
however
during
the
war
admiral
farragut
had
run
the
batteries
at
port
hudson
with
the
flagship
hartford
and
one
and
visited
me
from
below
vicksburg
the
of
february
admiral
porter
had
sent
the
gunboat
indianola
george
brown
commanding
below
she
met
colonel
ellet
of
the
marine
brigade
below
natchez
on
a
captured
steamer
two
of
the
colonel
fleet
had
previously
run
the
batteries
producing
the
greatest
consternation
among
the
people
along
the
mississippi
from
vicksburg
to
the
red
river
the
indianola
remained
about
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
some
days
and
then
started
up
the
mississippi
the
confederates
soon
raised
the
queen
of
the
west
and
repaired
her
with
this
vessel
and
the
ram
webb
which
they
had
had
for
some
time
in
the
red
river
and
two
other
steamers
they
followed
the
indianola
the
latter
was
encumbered
with
barges
of
coal
in
tow
and
consequently
could
make
but
little
speed
against
the
rapid
current
of
the
mississippi
the
confederate
fleet
overtook
her
just
above
grand
gulf
and
attacked
her
after
dark
on
the
of
february
the
indianola
was
superior
to
all
the
others
in
armament
and
probably
would
have
destroyed
them
or
driven
them
away
but
for
her
encumbrance
as
it
was
she
fought
them
for
an
hour
and
a
half
but
in
the
dark
was
struck
seven
or
eight
times
by
the
ram
and
other
vessels
and
was
finally
disabled
and
reduced
to
a
sinking
condition
the
armament
was
thrown
overboard
and
the
vessel
run
ashore
officers
and
crew
then
surrendered
i
had
started
mcclernand
with
his
corps
of
four
divisions
on
the
of
march
by
way
of
richmond
louisiana
to
new
carthage
hoping
that
he
might
capture
grand
gulf
before
the
balance
of
the
troops
could
get
there
but
the
roads
were
very
bad
scarcely
above
water
yet
some
miles
from
new
carthage
the
levee
to
bayou
vidal
was
broken
in
several
places
overflowing
the
roads
for
the
distance
of
two
miles
boats
were
collected
from
the
surrounding
bayous
and
some
constructed
on
the
spot
from
such
material
as
could
be
collected
to
transport
the
troops
across
the
overflowed
interval
by
the
of
april
mcclernand
had
reached
new
carthage
with
one
division
and
its
artillery
the
latter
ferried
through
the
woods
by
these
boats
on
the
i
visited
new
carthage
in
person
and
saw
that
the
process
of
getting
troops
through
in
the
way
we
were
doing
was
so
tedious
that
a
better
method
must
be
devised
the
water
was
falling
and
in
a
few
days
there
would
not
be
depth
enough
to
use
boats
nor
would
the
land
be
dry
enough
to
march
over
mcclernand
had
already
found
a
new
route
from
smith
plantation
where
the
crevasse
occurred
to
perkins
plantation
eight
to
twelve
miles
below
new
carthage
this
increased
the
march
from
milliken
bend
from
to
nearly
forty
miles
four
bridges
had
to
be
built
across
bayous
two
of
them
each
over
six
hundred
feet
long
making
about
two
thousand
feet
of
bridging
in
all
the
river
falling
made
the
current
in
these
bayous
very
rapid
increasing
the
difficulty
of
building
and
permanently
fastening
these
bridges
but
the
ingenuity
of
the
yankee
soldier
was
equal
to
any
emergency
the
bridges
were
soon
built
of
such
material
as
could
be
found
near
by
and
so
substantial
were
they
that
not
a
single
mishap
occurred
in
crossing
all
the
army
with
artillery
cavalry
and
wagon
trains
except
the
loss
of
one
siege
gun
a
pounder
this
if
my
memory
serves
me

of

march
by
order
of

mcclernand
was
already
below
on
the
mississippi
two
of
divisions
were
put
upon
the
march
immediately
the
third
had
not
yet
arrived
from
lake
providence
it
was
on
its
way
to
milliken
bend
and
was
to
follow
on
arrival
sherman
was
to
follow
mcpherson
two
of
his
divisions
were
at
duckport
and
young
point
and
the
third
under
steele
was
under
orders
to
return
from
greenville
mississippi
where
it
had
been
sent
to
expel
a
rebel
battery
that
had
been
annoying
our
transports
it
had
now
become
evident
that
the
army
could
not
be
rationed
by
a
wagon
train
over
the
single
narrow
and
almost
impassable
road
between
milliken
bend
and
perkins
plantation
accordingly
six
more
steamers
were
protected
as
before
to
run
the
batteries
and
were
loaded
with
supplies
they
took
twelve
barges
in
tow
loaded
also
with
rations
on
the
night
of
the
of
april
they
ran
the
batteries
five
getting
through
more
or
less
disabled
while
one
was
sunk
about
half
the
barges
got
through
with
their
needed
freight
when
it
was
first
proposed
to
run
the
blockade
at
vicksburg
with
river
steamers
there
were
but
two
captains
or
masters
who
were
willing
to
accompany
their
vessels
and
but
one
crew
volunteers
were
called
for
from
the
army
men
who
had
had
experience
in
any
capacity
in
navigating
the
western
rivers
captains
pilots
mates
engineers
and
enough
presented
themselves
to
take
five
times
the
number
of
vessels
we
were
moving
through
this
dangerous
ordeal
most
of
them
were
from
logan
division
composed
generally
of
men
from
the
southern
part
of
illinois
and
from
missouri
all
but
two
of
the
steamers
were
commanded
by
volunteers
from
the
army
and
all
but
one
so
manned
in
this
instance
as
in
all
others
during
the
war
i
found
that
volunteers
could
be
found
in
the
ranks
and
among
the
commissioned
officers
to
meet
every
call
for
aid
whether
mechanical
or

attack
on
grand
gulf
operations
below
vicksburg
on
the
my
headquarters
were
with
the
advance
at
plantation
reconnoissances
were
made
in
boats
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
high
land
on
the
east
shore
of
the
river
where
we
might
land
above
grand
gulf
there
was
none
practicable
accordingly
the
troops
were
set
in
motion
for
hard
times
miles
farther
down
the
river
and
nearly
opposite
grand
gulf
the
loss
of
two
steamers
and
six
barges
reduced
our
transportation
so
that
only
men
could
be
moved
by
water
some
of
the
steamers
that
had
got
below
were
injured
in
their
machinery
so
that
they
were
only
useful
as
barges
towed
by
those
less
severely
injured
all
the
troops
therefore
except
what
could
be
transported
in
one
trip
had
to
march
the
road
lay
west
of
lake
joseph
three
large
bayous
had
to
be
crossed
they
were
rapidly
bridged
in
the
same
manner
as
those
previously
encountered
on
the
mcclernand
corps
was
all
at
hard
times
and
was
following
closely
i
had
determined
to
make
the
attempt
to
effect
a
landing
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
as
soon
as
possible
accordingly
on
the
morning
of
the
mcclernand
was
directed
to
embark
all
the
troops
from
his
corps
that
our
transports
and
barges
could
carry
about
men
were
so
embarked
the
plan
was
to
have
the
navy
silence
the
guns
at
grand
gulf
and
to
have
as
many
men
as
possible
ready
to
debark
in
the
shortest
possible
time
under
cover
of
the
fire
of
the
navy
and
carry
the
works
by
storm
the
following
order
was
issued
perkins
plantation
april
j
mcclernand
commanding
commence
immediately
the
embarkation
of
your
corps
or
so
much
of
it
as
there
is
transportation
for
have
put
aboard
the
artillery
and
every
article
authorized
in
orders
limiting
baggage
except
the
men
and
hold
them
in
readiness
with
their
places
assigned
to
be
moved
at
a
warning
all
the
troops
you
may
have
except
those
ordered
to
remain
behind
send
to
a
point
nearly
opposite
grand
gulf
where
you
see
by
special
orders
of
this
date
general
mcpherson
is
ordered
to
send
one
division
the
plan
of
the
attack
will
be
for
the
navy
to
attack
and
silence
all
the
batteries
commanding
the
river
your
corps
will
be
on
the
river
ready
to
run
to
and
debark
on
the
nearest
eligible
land
below
the
promontory
first
brought
to
view
passing
down
the
river
once
on
shore
have
each
commander
instructed
beforehand
to
form
his
men
the
best
the
ground
will
admit
of
and
take
possession
of
the
most
commanding
points
but
avoid
separating
your
command
so
that
it
can
not
support
itself
the
first
object
is
to
get
a
foothold
where
our
troops
can
maintain
themselves
until
such
time
as
preparations
can
be
made
and
troops
collected
for
a
forward
movement
admiral
porter
has
proposed
to
place
his
boats
in
the
position
indicated
to
you
a
few
days
ago
and
to
bring
over
with
them
such
troops
as
may
be
below
the
city
after
the
guns
of
the
enemy
are
silenced
it
may
be
that
the
enemy
will
occupy
positions
back
from
the
city
out
of
range
of
the
gunboats
so
as
to
make
it
desirable
to
run
past
grand
gulf
and
land
at
rodney
in
case
this
should
prove
the
plan
a
signal
will
be
arranged
and
you
duly
informed
when
the
transports
are
to
start
with
this
view
or
it
may
be
expedient
for
the
boats
to
run
past
but
not
the
men
in
this
case
then
the
transports
would
have
to
be
brought
back
to
where
the
men
could
land
and
move
by
forced
marches
to
below
grand
gulf
rapidly
and
proceed
to
the
latter
place
there
will
be
required
then
three
signals
one
to
indicate
that
the
transports
can
run
down
and
debark
the
troops
at
grand
gulf
one
that
the
transports
can
run
by
without
the
troops
and
the
last
that
the
transports
can
run
by
with
the
troops
on
board
should
the
men
have
to
march
all
baggage
and
artillery
will
be
left
to
run
the
blockade
if
not
already
directed
require
your
men
to
keep
three
days
rations
in
their
haversacks
not
to
be
touched
until
a
movement
commences
grant
at
porter
made
the
attack
with
his
entire
strength
present
eight
gunboats
for
nearly
five
and
a
half
hours
the
attack
was
kept
up
without
silencing
a
single
gun
of
the
enemy
all
this
time
mcclernand
men
were
huddled
together
on
the
transports
in
the
stream
ready
to
attempt
a
landing
if
signalled
i
occupied
a
tug
from
which
i
could
see
the
effect
of
the
battle
on
both
sides
within
range
of
the
enemy
guns
but
a
small
tug
without
armament
was
not
calculated
to
attract
the
fire
of
batteries
while
they
were
being
assailed
themselves
about
one
the
fleet
withdrew
seeing
their
efforts
were
entirely
unavailing
the
enemy
ceased
firing
as
soon
as
we
withdrew
i
immediately
signalled
the
admiral
and
went
aboard
his
ship
the
navy
lost
in
this
engagement
eighteen
killed
and
wounded
a
large
proportion
of
these
were
of
the
crew
of
the
flagship
and
most
of
those
from
a
single
shell
which
penetrated
the
ship
side
and
exploded
between
decks
where
the
men
were
working
their
guns
the
sight
of
the
mangled
and
dying
men
which
met
my
eye
as
i
boarded
the
ship
was
sickening
grand
gulf
is
on
a
high
bluff
where
the
river
runs
at
the
very
foot
of
it
it
is
as
defensible
upon
its
front
as
vicksburg
and
at
that
time
would
have
been
just
as
impossible
to
capture
by
a
front
attack
i
therefore
requested
porter
to
run
the
batteries
with
his
fleet
that
night
and
to
take
charge
of
the
transports
all
of
which
would
be
wanted
below
there
is
a
long
tongue
of
land
from
the
louisiana
side
extending
towards
grand
gulf
made
by
the
river
running
nearly
east
from
about
three
miles
above
and
nearly
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
point
for
about
the
same
distance
below
the
land
was
so
low
and
wet
that
it
would
not
have
been
practicable
to
march
an
army
across
but
for
a
levee
i
had
had
this
explored
before
as
well
as
the
east
bank
below
to
ascertain
if
there
was
a
possible
point
of
debarkation
north
of
rodney
it
was
found
that
the
top
of
the
levee
afforded
a
good
road
to
march
upon
porter
as
was
always
the
case
with
him
not
only
acquiesced
in
the
plan
but
volunteered
to
use
his
entire
fleet
as
transports
i
had
intended
to
make
this
request
but
he
anticipated
me
at
dusk
when
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
enemy
at
grand
gulf
mcclernand
landed
his
command
on
the
west
bank
the
navy
and
transports
ran
the
batteries
successfully
the
troops
marched
across
the
point
of
land
under
cover
of
night
unobserved
by
the
time
it
was
light
the
enemy
saw
our
whole
fleet
ironclads
gunboats
river
steamers
and
barges
quietly
moving
down
the
river
three
miles
below
them
black
or
rather
blue
with
national
troops
when
the
troops
debarked
the
evening
of
the
it
was
expected
that
we
would
have
to
go
to
rodney
about
nine
miles
below
to
find
a
landing
but
that
night
a
colored
man
came
in
who
informed
me
that
a
good
landing
would
be
found
at
bruinsburg
a
few
miles
above
rodney
from
which
point
there
was
a
good
road
leading
to
port
gibson
some
twelve
miles
in
the
interior
the
information
was
found
correct
and
our
landing
was
effected
without
opposition
sherman
had
not
left
his
position
above
vicksburg
yet
on
the
morning
of
the
i
ordered
him
to
create
a
diversion
by
moving
his
corps
up
the
yazoo
and
threatening
an
attack
on
haines
bluff
my
object
was
to
compel
pemberton
to
keep
as
much
force
about
vicksburg
as
i
could
until
i
could
secure
a
good
footing
on
high
land
east
of
the
river
the
move
was
eminently
successful
and
as
we
afterwards
learned
created
great
confusion
about
vicksburg
and
doubts
about
our
real
design
sherman
moved
the
day
of
our
attack
on
grand
gulf
the
with
ten
regiments
of
his
command
and
eight
gunboats
which
porter
had
left
above
vicksburg
he
debarked
his
troops
and
apparently
made
every
preparation
to
attack
the
enemy
while
the
navy
bombarded
the
main
forts
at
haines
bluff
this
move
was
made
without
a
single
casualty
in
either
branch
of
the
service
on
the
first
of
may
sherman
received
orders
from
me
sent
from
hard
times
the
evening
of
the
of
april
to
withdraw
from
the
front
of
haines
bluff
and
follow
mcpherson
with
two
divisions
as
fast
as
he
could
i
had
established
a
depot
of
supplies
at
perkins
plantation
now
that
all
our
gunboats
were
below
grand
gulf
it
was
possible
that
the
enemy
might
fit
out
boats
in
the
big
black
with
improvised
armament
and
attempt
to
destroy
these
supplies
mcpherson
was
at
hard
times
with
a
portion
of
his
corps
and
the
depot
was
protected
by
a
part
of
his
command
the
night
of
the
i
directed
him
to
arm
one
of
the
transports
with
artillery
and
send
it
up
to
perkins
plantation
as
a
guard
and
also
to
have
the
siege
guns
we
had
brought
along
moved
there
and
put
in
position
the
embarkation
below
grand
gulf
took
place
at
de
shroon
louisiana
six
miles
above
bruinsburg
mississippi
early
on
the
morning
of
of
april
mcclernand
corps
and
one
division
of
mcpherson
corps
were
speedily
landed
when
this
was
effected
i
felt
a
degree
of
relief
scarcely
ever
equalled
since
vicksburg
was
not
yet
taken
it
is
true
nor
were
its
defenders
demoralized
by
any
of
our
previous
moves
i
was
now
in
the
country
with
a
vast
river
and
the
stronghold
of
vicksburg
between
me
and
my
base
of
supplies
but
i
was
on
dry
ground
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
with
the
enemy
all
the
campaigns
labors
hardships
and
exposures
from
the
month
of
december
previous
to
this
time
that
had
been
made
and
endured
were
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
one
object
i
had
with
me
the
corps
general
mcclernand
commanding
and
two
brigades
of
logan
division
of
the
corps
general
mcpherson
commanding
in
all
not
more
than
twenty
thousand
men
to
commence
the
campaign
with
these
were
soon
reinforced
by
the
remaining
brigade
of
logan
division
and
crocker
division
of
the
corps
on
the
of
may
i
was
further
reinforced
by
sherman
with
two
divisions
of
his
the
corps
my
total
force
was
then
about
thousand
men
the
enemy
occupied
grand
gulf
haines
bluff
and
jackson
with
a
force
of
nearly
sixty
thousand
men
jackson
is
fifty
miles
east
of
vicksburg
and
is
connected
with
it
by
a
railroad
my
first
problem
was
to
capture
grand
gulf
to
use
as
a
base
bruinsburg
is
two
miles
from
high
ground
the
bottom
at
that
point
is
higher
than
most
of
the
low
land
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
a
good
road
leads
to
the
bluff
it
was
natural
to
expect
the
garrison
from
grand
gulf
to
come
out
to
meet
us
and
prevent
if
they
could
our
reaching
this
solid
base
bayou
pierre
enters
the
mississippi
just
above
bruinsburg
and
as
it
is
a
navigable
stream
and
was
high
at
the
time
in
order
to
intercept
us
they
had
to
go
by
port
gibson
the
nearest
point
where
there
was
a
bridge
to
cross
upon
this
more
than
doubled
the
distance
from
grand
gulf
to
the
high
land
back
of
bruinsburg
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
securing
this
foothold
our
transportation
was
not
sufficient
to
move
all
the
army
across
the
river
at
one
trip
or
even
two
but
the
landing
of
the
corps
and
one
division
of
the
was
effected
during
the
day
april
and
early
evening
mcclernand
was
advanced
as
soon
as
ammunition
and
two
rations
to
last
five
could
be
issued
to
his
men
the
bluffs
were
reached
an
hour
before
sunset
and
mcclernand
was
pushed
on
hoping
to
reach
port
gibson
and
save
the
bridge
spanning
the
bayou
pierre
before
the
enemy
could
get
there
for
crossing
a
stream
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
is
always
difficult
port
gibson
too
is
the
starting
point
of
roads
to
grand
gulf
vicksburg
and
jackson
mcclernand
advance
met
the
enemy
about
five
miles
west
of
port
gibson
at
thompson
plantation
there
was
some
firing
during
the
night
but
nothing
rising
to
the
dignity
of
a
battle
until
daylight
the
enemy
had
taken
a
strong
natural
position
with
most
of
the
grand
gulf
garrison
numbering
about
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
under
general
bowen
his
hope
was
to
hold
me
in
check
until
reinforcements
under
loring
could
reach
him
from
vicksburg
but
loring
did
not
come
in
time
to
render
much
assistance
south
of
port
gibson
two
brigades
of
mcpherson
corps
followed
mcclernand
as
fast
as
rations
and
ammunition
could
be
issued
and
were
ready
to
take
position
upon
the
battlefield
whenever
the
corps
could
be
got
out
of
the
way
the
country
in
this
part
of
mississippi
stands
on
edge
as
it
were
the
roads
running
along
the
ridges
except
when
they
occasionally
pass
from
one
ridge
to
another
where
there
are
no
clearings
the
sides
of
the
hills
are
covered
with
a
very
heavy
growth
of
timber
and
with
undergrowth
and
the
ravines
are
filled
with
vines
and
canebrakes
almost
impenetrable
this
makes
it
easy
for
an
inferior
force
to
delay
if
not
defeat
a
far
superior
one
near
the
point
selected
by
bowen
to
defend
the
road
to
port
gibson
divides
taking
two
ridges
which
do
not
diverge
more
than
a
mile
or
two
at
the
widest
point
these
roads
unite
just
outside
the
town
this
made
it
necessary
for
mcclernand
to
divide
his
force
it
was
not
only
divided
but
it
was
separated
by
a
deep
ravine
of
the
character
above
described
one
flank
could
not
reinforce
the
other
except
by
marching
back
to
the
junction
of
the
roads
mcclernand
put
the
divisions
of
hovey
carr
and
smith
upon
the
branch
and
osterhaus
on
the
left
i
was
on
the
field
by
ten
and
inspected
both
flanks
in
person
on
the
right
the
enemy
if
not
being
pressed
back
was
at
least
not
repulsing
our
advance
on
the
left
however
osterhaus
was
not
faring
so
well
he
had
been
repulsed
with
some
loss
as
soon
as
the
road
could
be
cleared
of
mcclernand
troops
i
ordered
up
mcpherson
who
was
close
upon
the
rear
of
the
corps
with
two
brigades
of
division
this
was
about
noon
i
ordered
him
to
send
one
brigade
general
john
smith
was
selected
to
support
osterhaus
and
to
move
to
the
left
and
flank
the
enemy
out
of
his
position
this
movement
carried
the
brigade
over
a
deep
ravine
to
a
third
ridge
and
when
smith
troops
were
seen
well
through
the
ravine
osterhaus
was
directed
to
renew
his
front
attack
it
was
successful
and
unattended
by
heavy
loss
the
enemy
was
sent
in
full
retreat
on
their
right
and
their
left
followed
before
sunset
while
the
movement
to
our
left
was
going
on
mcclernand
who
was
with
his
right
flank
sent
me
frequent
requests
for
reinforcements
although
the
force
with
him
was
not
being
pressed
i
had
been
upon
the
ground
and
knew
it
did
not
admit
of
his
engaging
all
the
men
he
had
we
followed
up
our
victory
until
night
overtook
us
about
two
miles
from
port
gibson
then
the
troops
went
into
bivouac
for
the
night
chapter

movement
up
the
big
black
battle
of
raymond
we
started
next
morning
for
port
gibson
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
the
road
we
were
soon
in
the
town
and
i
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
enemy
had
not
stopped
to
contest
our
crossing
further
at
the
bridge
which
he
had
burned
the
troops
were
set
to
work
at
once
to
construct
a
bridge
across
the
south
fork
of
the
bayou
pierre
at
this
time
the
water
was
high
and
the
current
rapid
what
might
be
called
a
was
soon
constructed
from
material
obtained
from
wooden
buildings
stables
fences
which
sufficed
for
carrying
the
whole
army
over
safely
colonel
wilson
a
member
of
my
staff
planned
and
superintended
the
construction
of
this
bridge
going
into
the
water
and
working
as
hard
as
any
one
engaged
officers
and
men
generally
joined
in
this
work
when
it
was
finished
the
army
crossed
and
marched
eight
miles
beyond
to
the
north
fork
that
day
one
brigade
of
division
was
sent
down
the
stream
to
occupy
the
attention
of
a
rebel
battery
which
had
been
left
behind
with
infantry
supports
to
prevent
our
repairing
the
burnt
railroad
bridge
two
of
his
brigades
were
sent
up
the
bayou
to
find
a
crossing
and
reach
the
north
fork
to
repair
the
bridge
there
the
enemy
soon
left
when
he
found
we
were
building
a
bridge
elsewhere
before
leaving
port
gibson
we
were
reinforced
by
crocker
division
mcpherson
corps
which
had
crossed
the
mississippi
at
bruinsburg
and
come
up
without
stopping
except
to
get
two
rations
mcpherson
still
had
one
division
west
of
the
mississippi
river
guarding
the
road
from
milliken
bend
to
the
river
below
until
sherman
command
should
relieve
it
on
leaving
bruinsburg
for
the
front
i
left
my
son
frederick
who
had
joined
me
a
few
weeks
before
on
board
one
of
the
gunboats
asleep
and
hoped
to
get
away
without
him
until
after
grand
gulf
should
fall
into
our
hands
but
on
waking
up
he
learned
that
i
had
gone
and
being
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
battle
raging
at
thompson
hill
called
the
battle
of
port
gibson
found
his
way
to
where
i
was
he
had
no
horse
to
ride
at
the
time
and
i
had
no
facilities
for
even
preparing
a
meal
he
therefore
foraged
around
the
best
he
could
until
we
reached
grand
gulf
dana
then
an
officer
of
the
war
department
accompanied
me
on
the
vicksburg
campaign
and
through
a
portion
of
the
siege
he
was
in
the
same
situation
as
fred
so
far
as
transportation
and
mess
arrangements
were
concerned
the
first
time
i
call
to
mind
seeing
either
of
them
after
the
battle
they
were
mounted
on
two
enormous
horses
grown
white
from
age
each
equipped
with
dilapidated
saddles
and
bridles
our
trains
arrived
a
few
days
later
after
which
we
were
all
perfectly
equipped
my
son
accompanied
me
throughout
the
campaign
and
siege
and
caused
no
anxiety
either
to
me
or
to
his
mother
who
was
at
home
he
looked
out
for
himself
and
was
in
every
battle
of
the
campaign
his
age
then
not
quite
thirteen
enabled
him
to
take
in
all
he
saw
and
to
retain
a
recollection
of
it
that
would
not
be
possible
in
more
mature
years
when
the
movement
from
bruinsburg
commenced
we
were
without
a
wagon
train
the
train
still
west
of
the
mississippi
was
carried
around
with
proper
escort
by
a
circuitous
route
from
milliken
bend
to
hard
times
seventy
or
more
miles
below
and
did
not
get
up
for
some
days
after
the
battle
of
port
gibson
my
own
horses
headquarters
transportation
servants
mess
chest
and
everything
except
what
i
had
on
was
with
this
train
general
smith
happened
to
have
an
extra
horse
at
bruinsburg
which
i
borrowed
with
a
without
upholstering
further
than
stirrups
i
had
no
other
for
nearly
a
week
it
was
necessary
to
have
transportation
for
ammunition
provisions
could
be
taken
from
the
country
but
all
the
ammunition
that
can
be
carried
on
the
person
is
soon
exhausted
when
there
is
much
fighting
i
directed
therefore
immediately
on
landing
that
all
the
vehicles
and
draft
animals
whether
horses
mules
or
oxen
in
the
vicinity
should
be
collected
and
loaded
to
their
capacity
with
ammunition
quite
a
train
was
collected
during
the
and
a
motley
train
it
was
in
it
could
be
found
fine
carriages
loaded
nearly
to
the
top
with
boxes
of
cartridges
that
had
been
pitched
in
promiscuously
drawn
by
mules
with
plough
harness
straw
collars
etc
wagons
with
racks
for
carrying
cotton
bales
drawn
by
oxen
and
everything
that
could
be
found
in
the
way
of
transportation
on
a
plantation
either
for
use
or
pleasure
the
making
out
of
provision
returns
was
stopped
for
the
time
no
formalities
were
to
retard
our
progress
until
a
position
was
secured
when
the
time
could
be
spared
to
observe
them
it
was
at
port
gibson
i
first
heard
through
a
southern
paper
of
the
complete
success
of
colonel
grierson
who
was
making
a
raid
through
central
mississippi
he
had
started
from
la
grange
april
with
three
regiments
of
about
men
on
the
he
had
detached
colonel
hatch
with
one
regiment
to
destroy
the
railroad
between
columbus
and
macon
and
then
return
to
la
grange
hatch
had
a
sharp
fight
with
the
enemy
at
columbus
and
retreated
along
the
railroad
destroying
it
at
okalona
and
tupelo
and
arriving
in
la
grange
april
grierson
continued
his
movement
with
about
men
breaking
the
vicksburg
and
meridian
railroad
and
the
new
orleans
and
jackson
railroad
arriving
at
baton
rouge
may
this
raid
was
of
great
importance
for
grierson
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
enemy
from
the
main
movement
against
vicksburg
during
the
night
of
the
of
may
the
bridge
over
the
north
fork
was
repaired
and
the
troops
commenced
crossing
at
five
the
next
morning
before
the
leading
brigade
was
over
it
was
fired
upon
by
the
enemy
from
a
commanding
position
but
they
were
soon
driven
off
it
was
evident
that
the
enemy
was
covering
a
retreat
from
grand
gulf
to
vicksburg
every
commanding
position
from
this
grindstone
crossing
to
ferry
over
the
big
black
was
occupied
by
the
retreating
foe
to
delay
our
progress
mcpherson
however
reached
hankinson
ferry
before
night
seized
the
ferry
boat
and
sent
a
detachment
of
his
command
across
and
several
miles
north
on
the
road
to
vicksburg
when
the
junction
of
the
road
going
to
vicksburg
with
the
road
from
grand
gulf
to
raymond
and
jackson
was
reached
logan
with
his
division
was
turned
to
the
left
towards
grand
gulf
i
went
with
him
a
short
distance
from
this
junction
mcpherson
had
encountered
the
largest
force
yet
met
since
the
battle
of
port
gibson
and
had
a
skirmish
nearly
approaching
a
battle
but
the
road
logan
had
taken
enabled
him
to
come
up
on
the
enemy
right
flank
and
they
soon
gave
way
mcpherson
was
ordered
to
hold
hankinson
ferry
and
the
road
back
to
willow
springs
with
one
division
mcclernand
who
was
now
in
the
rear
was
to
join
in
this
as
well
as
to
guard
the
line
back
down
the
bayou
i
did
not
want
to
take
the
chances
of
having
an
enemy
lurking
in
our
rear
on
the
way
from
the
junction
to
grand
gulf
where
the
road
comes
into
the
one
from
vicksburg
to
the
same
place
six
or
seven
miles
out
i
learned
that
the
last
of
the
enemy
had
retreated
past
that
place
on
their
way
to
vicksburg
i
left
logan
to
make
the
proper
disposition
of
his
troops
for
the
night
while
i
rode
into
the
town
with
an
escort
of
about
twenty
cavalry
admiral
porter
had
already
arrived
with
his
fleet
the
enemy
had
abandoned
his
heavy
guns
and
evacuated
the
place
when
i
reached
grand
gulf
may
i
had
not
been
with
my
baggage
since
the
of
april
and
consequently
had
had
no
change
of
underclothing
no
meal
except
such
as
i
could
pick
up
sometimes
at
other
headquarters
and
no
tent
to
cover
me
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
get
a
bath
borrow
some
fresh
underclothing
from
one
of
the
naval
officers
and
get
a
good
meal
on
the
then
i
wrote
letters
to
the
informing
him
of
our
present
position
dispatches
to
be
telegraphed
from
cairo
orders
to
general
sullivan
commanding
above
vicksburg
and
gave
orders
to
all
my
corps
commanders
about
twelve
at
night
i
was
through
my
work
and
started
for
ferry
arriving
there
before
daylight
while
at
grand
gulf
i
heard
from
banks
who
was
on
the
red
river
and
who
said
that
he
could
not
be
at
port
hudson
before
the
of
may
and
then
with
only
men
up
to
this
time
my
intention
had
been
to
secure
grand
gulf
as
a
base
of
supplies
detach
mcclernand
corps
to
banks
and
with
him
in
the
reduction
of
port
hudson
the
news
from
banks
forced
upon
me
a
different
plan
of
campaign
from
the
one
intended
to
wait
for
his
would
have
detained
me
at
least
a
month
the
reinforcements
would
not
have
reached
ten
thousand
men
after
deducting
casualties
and
necessary
river
guards
at
all
high
points
close
to
the
river
for
over
three
hundred
miles
the
enemy
would
have
strengthened
his
position
and
been
reinforced
by
more
men
than
banks
could
have
brought
i
therefore
determined
to
move
independently
of
banks
cut
loose
from
my
base
destroy
the
rebel
force
in
rear
of
vicksburg
and
invest
or
capture
the
city
grand
gulf
was
accordingly
given
up
as
a
base
and
the
authorities
at
washington
were
notified
i
knew
well
that
halleck
caution
would
lead
him
to
disapprove
of
this
course
but
it
was
the
only
one
that
gave
any
chance
of
success
the
time
it
would
take
to
communicate
with
washington
and
get
a
reply
would
be
so
great
that
i
could
not
be
interfered
with
until
it
was
demonstrated
whether
my
plan
was
practicable
even
sherman
who
afterwards
ignored
bases
of
supplies
other
than
what
were
afforded
by
the
country
while
marching
through
four
states
of
the
confederacy
with
an
army
more
than
twice
as
large
as
mine
at
this
time
wrote
me
from
hankinson
ferry
advising
me
of
the
impossibility
of
supplying
our
army
over
a
single
road
he
urged
me
to
stop
all
troops
till
your
army
is
partially
supplied
with
wagons
and
then
act
as
quick
as
possible
for
this
road
will
be
jammed
as
sure
as
life
to
this
i
replied
i
do
not
calculate
upon
the
possibility
of
supplying
the
army
with
full
rations
from
grand
gulf
i
know
it
will
be
impossible
without
constructing
additional
roads
what
i
do
expect
is
to
get
up
what
rations
of
hard
bread
coffee
and
salt
we
can
and
make
the
country
furnish
the
balance
we
started
from
bruinsburg
with
an
average
of
about
two
days
rations
and
received
no
more
from
our
own
supplies
for
some
days
abundance
was
found
in
the
mean
time
a
delay
would
give
the
enemy
time
to
reinforce
and
fortify
mcclernand
and
mcpherson
commands
were
kept
substantially
as
they
were
on
the
night
of
the
awaiting
supplies
sufficient
to
give
them
three
days
rations
in
haversacks
beef
mutton
poultry
and
forage
were
found
in
abundance
quite
a
quantity
of
bacon
and
molasses
was
also
secured
from
the
country
but
bread
and
coffee
could
not
be
obtained
in
quantity
sufficient
for
all
the
men
every
plantation
however
had
a
run
of
stone
propelled
by
mule
power
to
grind
corn
for
the
owners
and
their
slaves
all
these
were
kept
running
while
we
were
stopping
day
and
night
and
when
we
were
marching
during
the
night
at
all
plantations
covered
by
the
troops
but
the
product
was
taken
by
the
troops
nearest
by
so
that
the
majority
of
the
command
was
destined
to
go
without
bread
until
a
new
base
was
established
on
the
yazoo
above
vicksburg
while
the
troops
were
awaiting
the
arrival
of
rations
i
ordered
reconnoissances
made
by
mcclernand
and
mcpherson
with
the
view
of
leading
the
enemy
to
believe
that
we
intended
to
cross
the
big
black
and
attack
the
city
at
once
on
the
sherman
arrived
at
grand
gulf
and
crossed
his
command
that
night
and
the
next
day
three
days
rations
had
been
brought
up
from
grand
gulf
for
the
advanced
troops
and
were
issued
orders
were
given
for
a
forward
movement
the
next
day
sherman
was
directed
to
order
up
blair
who
had
been
left
behind
to
guard
the
road
from
milliken
bend
to
hard
times
with
two
brigades
the
quartermaster
at
young
point
was
ordered
to
send
two
hundred
wagons
with
blair
and
the
commissary
was
to
load
them
with
hard
bread
coffee
sugar
salt
and
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
salt
meat
on
the
hurlbut
who
had
been
left
at
memphis
was
ordered
to
send
four
regiments
from
his
command
to
milliken
bend
to
relieve
division
and
on
the
he
was
ordered
to
send
lauman
division
in
addition
the
latter
to
join
the
army
in
the
field
the
four
regiments
were
to
be
taken
from
troops
near
the
river
so
that
there
would
be
no
delay
during
the
night
of
the
mcpherson
drew
in
his
troops
north
of
the
big
black
and
was
off
at
an
early
hour
on
the
road
to
jackson
via
rocky
springs
utica
and
raymond
that
night
he
and
mcclernand
were
both
at
rocky
springs
ten
miles
from
hankinson
ferry
mcpherson
remained
there
during
the
while
mcclernand
moved
to
big
sandy
and
sherman
marched
from
grand
gulf
to
hankinson
ferry
the
mcpherson
moved
to
a
point
within
a
few
miles
west
of
utica
mcclernand
and
sherman
remained
where
they
were
on
the
mcpherson
moved
to
utica
sherman
to
big
sandy
mcclernand
was
still
at
big
sandy
the
mcclernand
was
at
five
mile
creek
sherman
at
auburn
mcpherson
five
miles
advanced
from
utica
may
mcclernand
was
at
fourteen
mile
creek
sherman
at
fourteen
mile
creek
mcpherson
at
raymond
after
a
battle
after
mcpherson
crossed
the
big
black
at
hankinson
ferry
vicksburg
could
have
been
approached
and
besieged
by
the
south
side
it
is
not
probable
however
that
pemberton
would
have
permitted
a
close
besiegement
the
broken
nature
of
the
ground
would
have
enabled
him
to
hold
a
strong
defensible
line
from
the
river
south
of
the
city
to
the
big
black
retaining
possession
of
the
railroad
back
to
that
point
it
was
my
plan
therefore
to
get
to
the
railroad
east
of
vicksburg
and
approach
from
that
direction
accordingly
mcpherson
troops
that
had
crossed
the
big
black
were
withdrawn
and
the
movement
east
to
jackson
commenced
as
has
been
stated
before
the
country
is
very
much
broken
and
the
roads
generally
confined
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
the
troops
were
moved
one
sometimes
two
corps
at
a
time
to
reach
designated
points
out
parallel
to
the
railroad
and
only
from
six
to
ten
miles
from
it
corps
was
kept
with
its
left
flank
on
the
big
black
guarding
all
the
crossings
fourteen
mile
creek
a
stream
substantially
parallel
with
the
railroad
was
reached
and
crossings
effected
by
mcclernand
and
sherman
with
slight
loss
mcpherson
was
to
the
right
of
sherman
extending
to
raymond
the
cavalry
was
used
in
this
advance
in
reconnoitring
to
find
the
roads
to
cover
our
advances
and
to
find
the
most
practicable
routes
from
one
command
to
another
so
they
could
support
each
other
in
case
of
an
attack
in
making
this
move
i
estimated
pemberton
movable
force
at
vicksburg
at
about
eighteen
thousand
men
with
smaller
forces
at
haines
bluff
and
jackson
it
would
not
be
possible
for
pemberton
to
attack
me
with
all
his
troops
at
one
place
and
i
determined
to
throw
my
army
between
his
and
fight
him
in
detail
this
was
done
with
success
but
i
found
afterwards
that
i
had
entirely
pemberton
strength
up
to
this
point
our
movements
had
been
made
without
serious
opposition
my
line
was
now
nearly
parallel
with
the
jackson
and
vicksburg
railroad
and
about
seven
miles
south
of
it
the
right
was
at
raymond
eighteen
miles
from
jackson
mcpherson
commanding
sherman
in
the
centre
on
fourteen
mile
creek
his
advance
thrown
across
mcclernand
to
the
left
also
on
fourteen
mile
creek
advance
across
and
his
pickets
within
two
miles
of
edward
station
where
the
enemy
had
concentrated
a
considerable
force
and
where
they
undoubtedly
expected
us
to
attack
mcclernand
left
was
on
the
big
black
in
all
our
moves
up
to
this
time
the
left
had
hugged
the
big
black
closely
and
all
the
ferries
had
been
guarded
to
prevent
the
enemy
throwing
a
force
on
our
rear
mcpherson
encountered
the
enemy
five
thousand
strong
with
two
batteries
under
general
gregg
about
two
miles
out
of
raymond
this
was
about
two
logan
was
in
advance
with
one
of
his
brigades
he
deployed
and
moved
up
to
engage
the
enemy
mcpherson
ordered
the
road
in
rear
to
be
cleared
of
wagons
and
the
balance
of
logan
division
and
crocker
which
was
still
farther
in
rear
to
come
forward
with
all
dispatch
the
order
was
obeyed
with
alacrity
logan
got
his
division
in
position
for
assault
before
crocker
could
get
up
and
attacked
with
vigor
carrying
the
enemy
position
easily
sending
gregg
flying
from
the
field
not
to
appear
against
our
front
again
until
we
met
at
jackson
in
this
battle
mcpherson
lost
killed
wounded
and
missing
nearly
or
quite
all
from
logan
division
the
enemy
loss
was
killed
wounded
besides
taken
prisoners
i
regarded
logan
and
crocker
as
being
as
competent
division
commanders
as
could
be
found
in
or
out
of
the
army
and
both
equal
to
a
much
higher
command
crocker
however
was
dying
of
consumption
when
he
volunteered
his
weak
condition
never
put
him
on
the
sick
report
when
there
was
a
battle
in
prospect
as
long
as
he
could
keep
on
his
feet
he
died
not
long
after
the
close
of
the
rebellion
chapter
xxxv
movement
against
jackson
fall
of
jackson
intercepting
the
enemy
battle
of
champion
hill
when
the
news
reached
me
of
mcpherson
victory
at
raymond
about
sundown
my
position
was
with
sherman
i
decided
at
once
to
turn
the
whole
column
towards
jackson
and
capture
that
place
without
delay
pemberton
was
now
on
my
left
with
as
i
supposed
about
men
in
fact
as
i
learned
afterwards
with
nearly
a
force
was
also
collecting
on
my
right
at
jackson
the
point
where
all
the
railroads
communicating
with
vicksburg
connect
all
the
enemy
supplies
of
men
and
stores
would
come
by
that
point
as
i
hoped
in
the
end
to
besiege
vicksburg
i
must
first
destroy
all
possibility
of
aid
i
therefore
determined
to
move
swiftly
towards
jackson
destroy
or
drive
any
force
in
that
direction
and
then
turn
upon
pemberton
but
by
moving
against
jackson
i
uncovered
my
own
communication
so
i
finally
decided
to
have
none
to
cut
loose
altogether
from
my
base
and
move
my
whole
force
eastward
i
then
had
no
fears
for
my
communications
and
if
i
moved
quickly
enough
could
turn
upon
pemberton
before
he
could
attack
me
in
the
rear
accordingly
all
previous
orders
given
during
the
day
for
movements
on
the
were
annulled
by
new
ones
mcpherson
was
ordered
at
daylight
to
move
on
clinton
ten
miles
from
jackson
sherman
was
notified
of
my
determination
to
capture
jackson
and
work
from
there
westward
he
was
ordered
to
start
at
four
in
the
morning
and
march
to
raymond
mcclernand
was
ordered
to
march
with
three
divisions
by
dillon
to
raymond
one
was
left
to
guard
the
crossing
of
the
big
black
on
the
i
had
received
a
letter
from
banks
on
the
red
river
asking
reinforcements
porter
had
gone
to
his
assistance
with
a
part
of
his
fleet
on
the
and
i
now
wrote
to
him
describing
my
position
and
declining
to
send
any
troops
i
looked
upon
side
movements
as
long
as
the
enemy
held
port
hudson
and
vicksburg
as
a
waste
of
time
and
material
general
joseph
johnston
arrived
at
jackson
in
the
night
of
the
from
tennessee
and
immediately
assumed
command
of
all
the
confederate
troops
in
mississippi
i
knew
he
was
expecting
reinforcements
from
the
south
and
east
on
the
i
had
written
to
general
halleck
information
from
the
other
side
leaves
me
to
believe
the
enemy
are
bringing
forces
from
tullahoma
up
to
this
time
my
troops
had
been
kept
in
supporting
distances
of
each
other
as
far
as
the
nature
of
the
country
would
admit
reconnoissances
were
constantly
made
from
each
corps
to
enable
them
to
acquaint
themselves
with
the
most
practicable
routes
from
one
to
another
in
case
a
union
became
necessary
mcpherson
reached
clinton
with
the
advance
early
on
the
and
immediately
set
to
work
destroying
the
railroad
sherman
advance
reached
raymond
before
the
last
of
mcpherson
command
had
got
out
of
the
town
mcclernand
withdrew
from
the
front
of
the
enemy
at
station
with
much
skill
and
without
loss
and
reached
his
position
for
the
night
in
good
order
on
the
night
of
the
mcpherson
was
ordered
to
march
at
early
dawn
upon
jackson
only
fifteen
miles
away
sherman
was
given
the
same
order
but
he
was
to
move
by
the
direct
road
from
raymond
to
jackson
which
is
south
of
the
road
mcpherson
was
on
and
does
not
approach
within
two
miles
of
it
at
the
point
where
it
crossed
the
line
of
intrenchments
which
at
that
time
defended
the
city
mcclernand
was
ordered
to
move
one
division
of
his
command
to
clinton
one
division
a
few
miles
beyond
mississippi
springs
following
line
and
a
third
to
raymond
he
was
also
directed
to
send
his
siege
guns
four
in
number
with
the
troops
going
by
mississippi
springs
mcclernand
position
was
an
advantageous
one
in
any
event
with
one
division
at
clinton
he
was
in
position
to
reinforce
mcpherson
at
jackson
rapidly
if
it
became
necessary
the
division
beyond
mississippi
springs
was
equally
available
to
reinforce
sherman
the
one
at
raymond
could
take
either
road
he
still
had
two
other
divisions
farther
back
now
that
blair
had
come
up
available
within
a
day
at
jackson
if
this
last
command
should
not
be
wanted
at
jackson
they
were
already
one
day
march
from
there
on
their
way
to
vicksburg
and
on
three
different
roads
leading
to
the
latter
city
but
the
most
important
consideration
in
my
mind
was
to
have
a
force
confronting
pemberton
if
he
should
come
out
to
attack
my
rear
this
i
expected
him
to
do
as
shown
further
on
he
was
directed
by
johnston
to
make
this
very
move
i
notified
general
halleck
that
i
should
attack
the
state
capital
on
the
a
courier
carried
the
dispatch
to
grand
gulf
through
an
unprotected
country
sherman
and
mcpherson
communicated
with
each
other
during
the
night
and
arranged
to
reach
jackson
at
about
the
same
hour
it
rained
in
torrents
during
the
night
of
the
and
the
fore
part
of
the
day
of
the
the
roads
were
intolerable
and
in
some
places
on
sherman
line
where
the
land
was
low
they
were
covered
more
than
a
foot
deep
with
water
but
the
troops
never
murmured
by
nine
crocker
of
corps
who
was
now
in
advance
came
upon
the
enemy
pickets
and
speedily
drove
them
in
upon
the
main
body
they
were
outside
of
the
intrenchments
in
a
strong
position
and
proved
to
be
the
troops
that
had
been
driven
out
of
raymond
johnston
had
been
reinforced
during
the
night
by
georgia
and
south
carolina
regiments
so
that
his
force
amounted
to
eleven
thousand
men
and
he
was
expecting
still
more
sherman
also
came
upon
the
rebel
pickets
some
distance
out
from
the
town
but
speedily
drove
them
in
he
was
now
on
the
south
and
of
jackson
confronting
the
confederates
behind
their
breastworks
while
mcpherson
right
was
nearly
two
miles
north
occupying
a
line
running
north
and
south
across
the
vicksburg
railroad
artillery
was
brought
up
and
reconnoissances
made
preparatory
to
an
assault
mcpherson
brought
up
logan
division
while
he
deployed
crocker
for
the
assault
sherman
made
similar
dispositions
on
the
right
by
eleven
both
were
ready
to
attack
crocker
moved
his
division
forward
preceded
by
a
strong
skirmish
line
these
troops
at
once
encountered
the
enemy
advance
and
drove
it
back
on
the
main
body
when
they
returned
to
their
proper
regiment
and
the
whole
division
charged
routing
the
enemy
completely
and
driving
him
into
this
main
line
this
stand
by
the
enemy
was
made
more
than
two
miles
outside
of
his
main
fortifications
mcpherson
followed
up
with
his
command
until
within
range
of
the
guns
of
the
enemy
from
their
intrenchments
when
he
halted
to
bring
his
troops
into
line
and
reconnoitre
to
determine
the
next
move
it
was
now
about
noon
while
this
was
going
on
sherman
was
confronting
a
rebel
battery
which
enfiladed
the
road
on
which
he
was
marching
the
mississippi
springs
road
and
commanded
a
bridge
spanning
a
stream
over
which
he
had
to
pass
by
detaching
right
and
left
the
stream
was
forced
and
the
enemy
flanked
and
speedily
driven
within
the
main
line
this
brought
our
whole
line
in
front
of
the
enemy
line
of
works
which
was
continuous
on
the
north
west
and
south
sides
from
the
pearl
river
north
of
the
city
to
the
same
river
south
i
was
with
sherman
he
was
confronted
by
a
force
sufficient
to
hold
us
back
appearances
did
not
justify
an
assault
where
we
were
i
had
directed
sherman
to
send
a
force
to
the
right
and
to
reconnoitre
as
far
as
to
the
pearl
river
this
force
tuttle
division
not
returning
i
rode
to
the
right
with
my
staff
and
soon
found
that
the
enemy
had
left
that
part
of
the
line
movement
or
mcpherson
pressure
had
no
doubt
led
johnston
to
order
a
retreat
leaving
only
the
men
at
the
guns
to
retard
us
while
he
was
getting
away
tuttle
had
seen
this
and
passing
through
the
lines
without
resistance
came
up
in
the
rear
of
the
artillerists
confronting
sherman
and
captured
them
with
ten
pieces
of
artillery
i
rode
immediately
to
the
state
house
where
i
was
soon
followed
by
sherman
about
the
same
time
mcpherson
discovered
that
the
enemy
was
leaving
his
front
and
advanced
crocker
who
was
so
close
upon
the
enemy
that
they
could
not
move
their
guns
or
destroy
them
he
captured
seven
guns
and
moving
on
hoisted
the
national
flag
over
the
rebel
capital
of
mississippi
stevenson
brigade
was
sent
to
cut
off
the
rebel
retreat
but
was
too
late
or
not
expeditious
enough
our
loss
in
this
engagement
was
mcpherson
killed
wounded
sherman
killed
and
wounded
and
missing
the
enemy
lost
killed
wounded
and

into
our
hands
and
the

their
containing
a
large
amount
of
commissary
stores
on
this
day
blair
reached
new
auburn
and
joined
mcclernand
division
he
had
with
him
two
hundred
wagons
loaded
with
rations
the
only
commissary
supplies
received
during
the
entire
campaign
i
slept
that
night
in
the
room
that
johnston
was
said
to
have
occupied
the
night
before
about
four
in
the
afternoon
i
sent
for
the
corps
commanders
and
directed
the
dispositions
to
be
made
of
their
troops
sherman
was
to
remain
in
jackson
until
he
destroyed
that
place
as
a
railroad
centre
and
manufacturing
city
of
military
supplies
he
did
the
work
most
effectually
sherman
and
i
went
together
into
a
manufactory
which
had
not
ceased
work
on
account
of
the
battle
nor
for
the
entrance
of
yankee
troops
our
presence
did
not
seem
to
attract
the
attention
of
either
the
manager
or
the
operatives
most
of
whom
were
girls
we
looked
on
for
a
while
to
see
the
tent
cloth
which
they
were
making
roll
out
of
the
looms
with
s
a
woven
in
each
bolt
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
cotton
in
bales
stacked
outside
finally
i
told
sherman
i
thought
they
had
done
work
enough
the
operatives
were
told
they
could
leave
and
take
with
them
what
cloth
they
could
carry
in
a
few
minutes
cotton
and
factory
were
in
a
blaze
the
proprietor
visited
washington
while
i
was
president
to
get
his
pay
for
this
property
claiming
that
it
was
private
he
asked
me
to
give
him
a
statement
of
the
fact
that
his
property
had
been
destroyed
by
national
troops
so
that
he
might
use
it
with
congress
where
he
was
pressing
or
proposed
to
press
his
claim
i
declined
on
the
night
of
the
johnston
sent
the
following
dispatch
to
pemberton
at
edward
station
i
have
lately
arrived
and
learn
that
sherman
is
between
us
with
four
divisions
at
clinton
it
is
important
to
establish
communication
that
you
may
be
reinforced
if
practicable
come
up
in
his
rear
at
once
to
beat
such
a
detachment
would
be
of
immense
value
all
the
troops
you
can
quickly
assemble
should
be
brought
time
is
this
dispatch
was
sent
in
triplicate
by
different
messengers
one
of
the
messengers
happened
to
be
a
loyal
man
who
had
been
expelled
from
memphis
some
months
before
by
hurlbut
for
uttering
disloyal
and
threatening
sentiments
there
was
a
good
deal
of
parade
about
his
expulsion
ostensibly
as
a
warning
to
those
who
entertained
the
sentiments
he
expressed
but
hurlbut
and
the
expelled
man
understood
each
other
he
delivered
his
copy
of
dispatch
to
mcpherson
who
forwarded
it
to
me
receiving
this
dispatch
on
the
i
ordered
mcpherson
to
move
promptly
in
the
morning
back
to
bolton
the
nearest
point
where
johnston
could
reach
the
road
bolton
is
about
twenty
miles
west
of
jackson
i
also
informed
mcclernand
of
the
capture
of
jackson
and
sent
him
the
following
order
it
is
evidently
the
design
of
the
enemy
to
get
north
of
us
and
cross
the
big
black
and
beat
us
into
vicksburg
we
must
not
allow
them
to
do
this
turn
all
your
forces
towards
bolton
station
and
make
all
dispatch
in
getting
there
move
troops
by
the
most
direct
road
from
wherever
they
may
be
on
the
receipt
of
this
order
and
to
blair
i
wrote
their
design
is
evidently
to
cross
the
big
black
and
pass
down
the
peninsula
between
the
big
black
and
yazoo
rivers
we
must
beat
them
turn
your
troops
immediately
to
bolton
take
all
the
trains
with
you
smith
division
and
any
other
troops
now
with
you
will
go
to
the
same
place
if
practicable
take
parallel
roads
so
as
to
divide
your
troops
and
train
johnston
stopped
on
the
canton
road
only
six
miles
north
of
jackson
the
night
of
the
he
sent
from
there
to
pemberton
dispatches
announcing
the
loss
of
jackson
and
the
following
order
as
soon
as
the
reinforcements
are
all
up
they
must
be
united
to
the
rest
of
the
army
i
am
anxious
to
see
a
force
assembled
that
may
be
able
to
inflict
a
heavy
blow
upon
the
enemy
can
grant
supply
himself
from
the
mississippi
can
you
not
cut
him
off
from
it
and
above
all
should
he
be
compelled
to
fall
back
for
want
of
supplies
beat
him
the
concentration
of
my
troops
was
easy
considering
the
character
of
the
country
mcpherson
moved
along
the
road
parallel
with
and
near
the
railroad
mcclernand
command
was
one
division
hovey
on
the
road
mcpherson
had
to
take
but
with
a
start
of
four
miles
one
osterhaus
was
at
raymond
on
a
converging
road
that
intersected
the
other
near
champion
hill
one
carr
had
to
pass
over
the
same
road
with
osterhaus
but
being
back
at
mississippi
springs
would
not
be
detained
by
it
the
fourth
smith
with
blair
division
was
near
auburn
with
a
different
road
to
pass
over
mcclernand
faced
about
and
moved
promptly
his
cavalry
from
raymond
seized
bolton
by
nine
in
the
morning
driving
out
the
enemy
pickets
and
capturing
several
men
the
night
of
the
hovey
was
at
bolton
carr
and
osterhaus
were
about
three
miles
south
but
abreast
facing
west
smith
was
north
of
raymond
with
blair
in
his
rear
mcpherson
command
with
logan
in
front
had
marched
at
seven
and
by
four
reached
hovey
and
went
into
camp
crocker
bivouacked
just
in
hovey
rear
on
the
clinton
road
sherman
with
two
divisions
was
in
jackson
completing
the
destruction
of
roads
bridges
and
military
factories
i
rode
in
person
out
to
clinton
on
my
arrival
i
ordered
mcclernand
to
move
early
in
the
morning
on
edward
station
cautioning
him
to
watch
for
the
enemy
and
not
bring
on
an
engagement
unless
he
felt
very
certain
of
success
i
naturally
expected
that
pemberton
would
endeavor
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
superior
which
i
have
shown
were
to
attack
us
at
clinton
this
indeed
i
knew
he
could
not
do
but
i
felt
sure
he
would
make
the
attempt
to
reach
that
point
it
turned
out
however
that
he
had
decided
his
superior
plans
were
impracticable
and
consequently
determined
to
move
south
from
edward
station
and
get
between
me
and
my
base
i
however
had
no
base
having
abandoned
it
more
than
a
week
before
on
the
pemberton
had
actually
marched
south
from
station
but
the
rains
had
swollen
baker
creek
which
he
had
to
cross
so
much
that
he
could
not
ford
it
and
the
bridges
were
washed
away
this
brought
him
back
to
the
jackson
road
on
which
there
was
a
good
bridge
over
baker
creek
some
of
his
troops
were
marching
until
midnight
to
get
there
receiving
here
early
on
the
a
repetition
of
his
order
to
join
johnston
at
clinton
he
concluded
to
obey
and
sent
a
dispatch
to
his
chief
informing
him
of
the
route
by
which
he
might
be
expected
about
five
in
the
morning
two
men
who
had
been
employed
on
the
jackson
and
vicksburg
railroad
were
brought
to
me
they
reported
that
they
had
passed
through
pemberton
army
in
the
night
and
that
it
was
still
marching
east
they
reported
him
to
have
eighty
regiments
of
infantry
and
ten
batteries
in
all
about
thousand
men
i
had
expected
to
leave
sherman
at
jackson
another
day
in
order
to
complete
his
work
but
getting
the
above
information
i
sent
him
orders
to
move
with
all
dispatch
to
bolton
and
to
put
one
division
with
an
ammunition
train
on
the
road
at
once
with
directions
to
its
commander
to
march
with
all
possible
speed
until
he
came
up
to
our
rear
within
an
hour
after
receiving
this
order
steele
division
was
on
the
road
at
the
same
time
i
dispatched
to
blair
who
was
near
auburn
to
move
with
all
speed
to
edward
station
mcclernand
was
directed
to
embrace
blair
in
his
command
for
the
present
blair
division
was
a
part
of
the
army
corps
sherman
but
as
it
was
on
its
way
to
join
its
corps
it
naturally
struck
our
left
first
now
that
we
had
faced
about
and
were
moving
west
the
corps
when
it
got
up
would
be
on
our
extreme
right
mcpherson
was
directed
to
get
his
trains
out
of
the
way
of
the
troops
and
to
follow
hovey
division
as
closely
as
possible
mcclernand
had
two
roads
about
three
miles
apart
converging
at
station
over
which
to
march
his
troops
hovey
division
of
his
corps
had
the
advance
on
a
third
road
the
clinton
still
farther
north
mcclernand
was
directed
to
move
blair
and
smith
divisions
by
the
southernmost
of
these
roads
and
osterhaus
and
carr
by
the
middle
road
orders
were
to
move
cautiously
with
skirmishers
to
the
front
to
feel
for
the
enemy
smith
division
on
the
most
southern
road
was
the
first
to
encounter
the
enemy
pickets
who
were
speedily
driven
in
osterhaus
on
the
middle
road
hearing
the
firing
pushed
his
skirmishers
forward
found
the
enemy
pickets
and
forced
them
back
to
the
main
line
about
the
same
time
hovey
encountered
the
enemy
on
the
northern
or
direct
wagon
road
from
jackson
to
vicksburg
mcpherson
was
hastening
up
to
join
hovey
but
was
embarrassed
by
hovey
trains
occupying
the
roads
i
was
still
back
at
clinton
mcpherson
sent
me
word
of
the
situation
and
expressed
the
wish
that
i
was
up
by
seven
i
was
on
the
road
and
proceeded
rapidly
to
the
front
ordering
all
trains
that
were
in
front
of
troops
off
the
road
when
i
arrived
hovey
skirmishing
amounted
almost
to
a
battle
mcclernand
was
in
person
on
the
middle
road
and
had
a
shorter
distance
to
march
to
reach
the
enemy
position
than
mcpherson
i
sent
him
word
by
a
staff
officer
to
push
forward
and
attack
these
orders
were
repeated
several
times
without
apparently
expediting
advance
champion
hill
where
pemberton
had
chosen
his
position
to
receive
us
whether
taken
by
accident
or
design
was
well
selected
it
is
one
of
the
highest
points
in
that
section
and
commanded
all
the
ground
in
range
on
the
east
side
of
the
ridge
which
is
quite
precipitous
is
a
ravine
running
first
north
then
westerly
terminating
at
baker
creek
it
was
grown
up
thickly
with
large
trees
and
undergrowth
making
it
difficult
to
penetrate
with
troops
even
when
not
defended
the
ridge
occupied
by
the
enemy
terminated
abruptly
where
the
ravine
turns
westerly
the
left
of
the
enemy
occupied
the
north
end
of
this
ridge
the
bolton
and
edward
station
turns
almost
due
south
at
this
point
and
ascends
the
ridge
which
it
follows
for
about
a
mile
then
turning
west
descends
by
a
gentle
declivity
to
baker
creek
nearly
a
mile
away
on
the
west
side
the
slope
of
the
ridge
is
gradual
and
is
cultivated
from
near
the
summit
to
the
creek
there
was
when
we
were
there
a
narrow
belt
of
timber
near
the
summit
west
of
the
road
from
raymond
there
is
a
direct
road
to
edward
station
some
three
miles
west
of
champion
hill
there
is
one
also
to
bolton
from
this
latter
road
there
is
still
another
leaving
it
about
three
and
a
half
miles
before
reaching
bolton
and
leads
direct
to
the
same
station
it
was
along
these
two
roads
that
three
divisions
of
mcclernand
corps
and
blair
of
sherman
temporarily
under
mcclernand
were
moving
hovey
of
mcclernand
command
was
with
mcpherson
farther
north
on
the
road
from
bolton
direct
to
edward
station
the
middle
road
comes
into
the
northern
road
at
the
point
where
the
latter
turns
to
the
west
and
descends
to
baker
creek
the
southern
road
is
still
several
miles
south
and
does
not
intersect
the
others
until
it
reaches
station
pemberton
lines
covered
all
these
roads
and
faced
east
hovey
line
when
it
first
drove
in
the
enemy
pickets
was
formed
parallel
to
that
of
the
enemy
and
confronted
his
left
by
eleven
the
skirmishing
had
grown
into
a
battle
hovey
alone
before
other
troops
could
be
got
to
assist
him
had
captured
a
battery
of
the
enemy
but
he
was
not
able
to
hold
his
position
and
had
to
abandon
the
artillery
mcpherson
brought
up
his
troops
as
fast
as
possible
logan
in
front
and
posted
them
on
the
right
of
hovey
and
across
the
flank
of
the
enemy
logan
reinforced
hovey
with
one
brigade
from
his
division
with
his
other
two
he
moved
farther
west
to
make
room
for
crocker
who
was
coming
up
as
rapidly
as
the
roads
would
admit
hovey
was
still
being
heavily
pressed
and
was
calling
on
me
for
more
reinforcements
i
ordered
crocker
who
was
now
coming
up
to
send
one
brigade
from
his
division
mcpherson
ordered
two
batteries
to
be
stationed
where
they
nearly
enfiladed
the
enemy
line
and
they
did
good
execution
from
logan
position
now
a
direct
forward
movement
carried
him
over
open
fields
in
rear
of
the
enemy
and
in
a
line
parallel
with
them
he
did
make
exactly
this
move
attacking
however
the
enemy
through
the
belt
of
woods
covering
the
west
slope
of
the
hill
for
a
short
distance
up
to
this
time
i
had
kept
my
position
near
hovey
where
we
were
the
most
heavily
pressed
but
about
noon
i
moved
with
a
part
of
my
staff
by
our
right
around
until
i
came
up
with
logan
himself
i
found
him
near
the
road
leading
down
to
baker
creek
he
was
actually
in
command
of
the
only
road
over
which
the
enemy
could
retreat
hovey
reinforced
by
two
brigades
from
mcpherson
command
confronted
the
enemy
left
crocker
with
two
brigades
covered
their
left
flank
mcclernand
two
hours
before
had
been
within
two
miles
and
a
half
of
their
centre
with
two
divisions
and
the
two
divisions
blair
and
smith
were
confronting
the
rebel
right
ransom
with
a
brigade
of
division
of
the
corps
mcpherson
had
crossed
the
river
at
grand
gulf
a
few
days
before
and
was
coming
up
on
their
right
flank
neither
logan
nor
i
knew
that
we
had
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
just
at
this
juncture
a
messenger
came
from
hovey
asking
for
more
reinforcements
there
were
none
to
spare
i
then
gave
an
order
to
move
mcpherson
command
by
the
left
flank
around
to
hovey
this
uncovered
the
rebel
line
of
retreat
which
was
soon
taken
advantage
of
by
the
enemy
during
all
this
time
hovey
reinforced
as
he
was
by
a
brigade
from
logan
and
another
from
crocker
and
by
crocker
gallantly
coming
up
with
two
other
brigades
on
his
right
had
made
several
assaults
the
last
one
about
the
time
the
road
was
opened
to
the
rear
the
enemy
fled
precipitately
this
was
between
three
and
four
i
rode
forward
or
rather
back
to
where
the
middle
road
intersects
the
north
road
and
found
the
skirmishers
of
carr
division
just
coming
in
osterhaus
was
farther
south
and
soon
after
came
up
with
skirmishers
advanced
in
like
manner
hovey
division
and
mcpherson
two
divisions
with
him
had
marched
and
fought
from
early
dawn
and
were
not
in
the
best
condition
to
follow
the
retreating
foe
i
sent
orders
to
osterhaus
to
pursue
the
enemy
and
to
carr
whom
i
saw
personally
i
explained
the
situation
and
directed
him
to
pursue
vigorously
as
far
as
the
big
black
and
to
cross
it
if
he
could
osterhaus
to
follow
him
the
pursuit
was
continued
until
after
dark
the
battle
of
champion
hill
lasted
about
four
hours
hard
fighting
preceded
by
two
or
three
hours
of
skirmishing
some
of
which
almost
rose
to
the
dignity
of
battle
every
man
of
hovey
division
and
of
mcpherson
two
divisions
was
engaged
during
the
battle
no
other
part
of
my
command
was
engaged
at
all
except
that
as
described
before
osterhaus
and
smith
divisions
had
encountered
the
rebel
advanced
pickets
as
early
as
seven
their
positions
were
admirable
for
advancing
upon
the
enemy
line
mcclernand
with
two
divisions
was
within
a
few
miles
of
the
long
before
noon
and
in
easy
hearing
i
sent
him
repeated
orders
by
staff
officers
fully
competent
to
explain
to
him
the
situation
these
traversed
the
wood
separating
us
without
escort
and
directed
him
to
push
forward
but
he
did
not
come
it
is
true
in
front
of
mcclernand
there
was
a
small
force
of
the
enemy
and
posted
in
a
good
position
behind
a
ravine
obstructing
his
advance
but
if
he
had
moved
to
the
right
by
the
road
my
staff
officers
had
followed
the
enemy
must
either
have
fallen
back
or
been
cut
off
instead
of
this
he
sent
orders
to
hovey
who
belonged
to
his
corps
to
join
on
to
his
right
flank
hovey
was
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
battle
at
the
time
to
obey
the
order
he
would
have
had
to
pull
out
from
the
front
of
the
enemy
and
march
back
as
far
as
mcclernand
had
to
advance
to
get
into
battle
and
substantially
over
the
same
ground
of
course
i
did
not
permit
hovey
to
obey
the
order
of
his
intermediate
superior
we
had
in
this
battle
about
men
absolutely
engaged
this
excludes
those
that
did
not
get
up
all
of
mcclernand
command
except
hovey
our
loss
was
killed
wounded
and
missing
hovey
alone
lost
killed
wounded
and
missing
more
than
of
his
division
had
mcclernand
come
up
with
reasonable
promptness
or
had
i
known
the
ground
as
i
did
afterwards
i
can
not
see
how
pemberton
could
have
escaped
with
any
organized
force
as
it
was
he
lost
over
three
thousand
killed
and
wounded
and
about
three
thousand
captured
in
battle
and
in
pursuit
loring
division
which
was
the
right
of
pemberton
line
was
cut
off
from
the
retreating
army
and
never
got
back
into
vicksburg
pemberton
himself
fell
back
that
night
to
the
big
black
river
his
troops
did
not
stop
before
midnight
and
many
of
them
left
before
the
general
retreat
commenced
and
no
doubt
a
good
part
of
them
returned
to
their
homes
logan
alone
captured
prisoners
and
eleven
guns
hovey
captured
under
fire
and
about
in
all
exclusive
of
sick
and
wounded
whom
he
paroled
thus
making
mcpherson
joined
in
the
advance
as
soon
as
his
men
could
fill
their
leaving
one
brigade
to
guard
our
wounded
the
pursuit
was
continued
as
long
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
the
road
the
night
of
the
of
may
found
mcpherson
command
bivouacked
from
two
to
six
miles
west
of
the
battlefield
along
the
line
of
the
road
to
vicksburg
carr
and
osterhaus
were
at
edward
station
and
blair
was
about
three
miles
hovey
remained
on
the
field
where
his
troops
had
fought
so
bravely
and
bled
so
freely
much
war
material
abandoned
by
the
enemy
was
picked
up
on
the
among
it
thirty
pieces
of
artillery
i
pushed
through
the
advancing
column
with
my
staff
and
kept
in
advance
until
after
night
finding
ourselves
alone
we
stopped
and
took
possession
of
a
vacant
house
as
no
troops
came
up
we
moved
back
a
mile
or
more
until
we
met
the
head
of
the
column
just
going
into
bivouac
on
the
road
we
had
no
tents
so
we
occupied
the
porch
of
a
house
which
had
been
taken
for
a
rebel
hospital
and
which
was
filled
with
wounded
and
dying
who
had
been
brought
from
the
we
had
just
left
while
a
battle
is
raging
one
can
see
his
enemy
mowed
down
by
the
thousand
or
the
ten
thousand
with
great
composure
but
after
the
battle
these
scenes
are
distressing
and
one
is
naturally
disposed
to
do
as
much
to
alleviate
the
suffering
of
an
enemy
as
a
friend
chapter
xxxvi
battle
of
black
river
bridge
crossing
the
big
black
investment
of
vicksburg
assaulting
the
works
we
were
now
assured
of
our
position
between
johnston
and
pemberton
without
a
possibility
of
a
junction
of
their
forces
pemberton
might
have
made
a
night
march
to
the
big
black
crossed
the
bridge
there
and
by
moving
north
on
the
west
side
have
eluded
us
and
finally
returned
to
johnston
but
this
would
have
given
us
vicksburg
it
would
have
been
his
proper
move
however
and
the
one
johnston
would
have
made
had
he
been
in
pemberton
place
in
fact
it
would
have
been
in
conformity
with
johnston
orders
to
pemberton
sherman
left
jackson
with
the
last
of
his
troops
about
noon
on
the
and
reached
bolton
twenty
miles
west
before
halting
his
rear
guard
did
not
get
in
until
two
the
but
renewed
their
march
by
daylight
he
paroled
his
prisoners
at
jackson
and
was
forced
to
leave
his
own
wounded
in
care
of
surgeons
and
attendants
at
bolton
he
was
informed
of
our
victory
he
was
directed
to
commence
the
march
early
next
day
and
to
diverge
from
the
road
he
was
on
to
bridgeport
on
the
big
black
river
some
eleven
miles
above
the
point
where
we
expected
to
find
the
enemy
blair
was
ordered
to
join
him
there
with
the
pontoon
train
as
early
as
possible
this
movement
brought
sherman
corps
together
and
at
a
point
where
i
hoped
a
crossing
of
the
big
black
might
be
effected
and
sherman
corps
used
to
flank
the
enemy
out
of
his
position
in
our
front
thus
opening
a
crossing
for
the
remainder
of
the
army
i
informed
him
that
i
would
endeavor
to
hold
the
enemy
in
my
front
while
he
crossed
the
river
the
advance
division
carr
mcclernand
corps
resumed
the
pursuit
at
three
on
the
followed
closely
by
osterhaus
mcpherson
bringing
up
the
rear
with
his
corps
as
i
expected
the
enemy
was
found
in
position
on
the
big
black
the
point
was
only
six
miles
from
that
where
my
advance
had
rested
for
the
night
and
was
reached
at
an
early
hour
here
the
river
makes
a
turn
to
the
west
and
has
washed
close
up
to
the
high
land
the
east
side
is
a
low
bottom
sometimes
overflowed
at
very
high
water
but
was
cleared
and
in
cultivation
a
bayou
runs
irregularly
across
this
low
land
the
bottom
of
which
however
is
above
the
surface
of
the
big
black
at
ordinary
stages
when
the
river
is
full
water
runs
through
it
converting
the
point
of
land
into
an
island
the
bayou
was
grown
up
with
timber
which
the
enemy
had
felled
into
the
ditch
at
this
time
there
was
a
foot
or
two
of
water
in
it
the
rebels
had
constructed
a
parapet
along
the
inner
bank
of
this
bayou
by
using
cotton
bales
from
the
plantation
close
by
and
throwing
dirt
over
them
the
whole
was
thoroughly
commanded
from
the
height
west
of
the
river
at
the
upper
end
of
the
bayou
there
was
a
strip
of
uncleared
land
which
afforded
a
cover
for
a
portion
of
our
men
division
was
deployed
on
our
right
lawler
brigade
forming
his
extreme
right
and
reaching
through
these
woods
to
the
river
above
division
was
deployed
to
the
left
of
carr
and
covered
the
enemy
entire
front
mcpherson
was
in
column
on
the
road
the
head
close
by
ready
to
come
in
wherever
he
could
be
of
assistance
while
the
troops
were
standing
as
here
described
an
officer
from
staff
came
up
and
presented
me
with
a
letter
from
general
halleck
dated
the
of
may
it
had
been
sent
by
the
way
of
new
orleans
to
banks
to
be
forwarded
to
me
it
ordered
me
to
return
to
grand
gulf
and
to
from
there
with
banks
against
port
hudson
and
then
to
return
with
our
combined
forces
to
besiege
vicksburg
i
told
the
officer
that
the
order
came
too
late
and
that
halleck
would
not
give
it
now
if
he
knew
our
position
the
bearer
of
the
dispatch
insisted
that
i
ought
to
obey
the
order
and
was
giving
arguments
to
support
his
position
when
i
heard
great
cheering
to
the
right
of
our
line
and
looking
in
that
direction
saw
lawler
in
his
shirt
sleeves
leading
a
charge
upon
the
enemy
i
immediately
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
in
the
direction
of
the
charge
and
saw
no
more
of
the
officer
who
delivered
the
dispatch
i
think
not
even
to
this
day
the
assault
was
successful
but
little
resistance
was
made
the
enemy
fled
from
the
west
bank
of
the
river
burning
the
bridge
behind
him
and
leaving
the
men
and
guns
on
the
east
side
to
fall
into
our
hands
many
tried
to
escape
by
swimming
the
river
some
succeeded
and
some
were
drowned
in
the
attempt
eighteen
guns
were
captured
and
prisoners
our
loss
was
killed
wounded
and
missing
the
enemy
probably
lost
but
few
men
except
those
captured
and
drowned
but
for
the
successful
and
complete
destruction
of
the
bridge
i
have
but
little
doubt
that
we
should
have
followed
the
enemy
so
closely
as
to
prevent
his
occupying
his
defences
around
vicksburg
as
the
bridge
was
destroyed
and
the
river
was
high
new
bridges
had
to
be
built
it
was
but
little
after
nine
when
the
capture
took
place
as
soon
as
work
could
be
commenced
orders
were
given
for
the
construction
of
three
bridges
one
was
taken
charge
of
by
lieutenant
hains
of
the
engineer
corps
one
by
general
mcpherson
himself
and
one
by
general
ransom
a
most
gallant
and
intelligent
volunteer
officer
my
recollection
is
that
hains
built
a
raft
bridge
mcpherson
a
pontoon
using
cotton
bales
in
large
numbers
for
pontoons
and
that
ransom
felled
trees
on
opposite
banks
of
the
river
cutting
only
on
one
side
of
the
tree
so
that
they
would
fall
with
their
tops
interlacing
in
the
river
without
the
trees
being
entirely
severed
from
their
stumps
a
bridge
was
then
made
with
these
trees
to
support
the
roadway
lumber
was
taken
from
buildings
cotton
gins
and
wherever
found
for
this
purpose
by
eight
in
the
morning
of
the
all
three
bridges
were
complete
and
the
troops
were
crossing
sherman
reached
bridgeport
about
noon
of
the
and
found
blair
with
the
pontoon
train
already
there
a
few
of
the
enemy
were
intrenched
on
the
west
bank
but
they
made
little
resistance
and
soon
surrendered
two
divisions
were
crossed
that
night
and
the
third
the
following
morning
on
the
i
moved
along
the
vicksburg
road
in
advance
of
the
troops
and
as
soon
as
possible
joined
sherman
my
first
anxiety
was
to
secure
a
base
of
supplies
on
the
yazoo
river
above
vicksburg
sherman
line
of
march
led
him
to
the
very
point
on
walnut
hills
occupied
by
the
enemy
the
december
before
when
he
was
repulsed
sherman
was
equally
anxious
with
myself
our
impatience
led
us
to
move
in
advance
of
the
column
and
well
up
with
the
advanced
skirmishers
there
were
some
detached
works
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
these
were
still
occupied
by
the
enemy
or
else
the
garrison
from
haines
bluff
had
not
all
got
past
on
their
way
to
vicksburg
at
all
events
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
whistled
by
thick
and
fast
for
a
short
time
in
a
few
minutes
sherman
had
the
pleasure
of
looking
down
from
the
spot
coveted
so
much
by
him
the
december
before
on
the
ground
where
his
command
had
lain
so
helpless
for
offensive
action
he
turned
to
me
saying
that
up
to
this
minute
he
had
felt
no
positive
assurance
of
success
this
however
he
said
was
the
end
of
one
of
the
greatest
campaigns
in
history
and
i
ought
to
make
a
report
of
it
at
once
vicksburg
was
not
yet
captured
and
there
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
before
it
was
taken
but
whether
captured
or
not
this
was
a
complete
and
successful
campaign
i
do
not
claim
to
quote
language
but
the
substance
only
my
reason
for
mentioning
this
incident
will
appear
further
on
mcpherson
after
crossing
the
big
black
came
into
the
jackson
and
vicksburg
road
which
sherman
was
on
but
to
his
rear
he
arrived
at
night
near
the
lines
of
the
enemy
and
went
into
camp
mcclernand
moved
by
the
direct
road
near
the
railroad
to
mount
albans
and
then
turned
to
the
left
and
put
his
troops
on
the
road
from
baldwin
ferry
to
vicksburg
this
brought
him
south
of
mcpherson
i
now
had
my
three
corps
up
the
works
built
for
the
defence
of
vicksburg
on
three
roads
one
to
the
north
one
to
the
east
and
one
to
the
of
the
city
by
the
morning
of
the
the
investment
was
as
complete
as
my
limited
number
of
troops
would
allow
sherman
was
on
the
right
and
covered
the
high
ground
from
where
it
overlooked
the
yazoo
as
far
as
his
troops
would
extend
mcpherson
joined
on
to
his
left
and
occupied
ground
on
both
sides
of
the
jackson
road
mcclernand
took
up
the
ground
to
his
left
and
extended
as
far
towards
warrenton
as
he
could
keeping
a
continuous
line
on
the
there
was
constant
skirmishing
with
the
enemy
while
we
were
getting
into
better
position
the
enemy
had
been
much
demoralized
by
his
defeats
at
champion
hill
and
the
big
black
and
i
believed
he
would
not
make
much
effort
to
hold
vicksburg
accordingly
at
two
i
ordered
an
assault
it
resulted
in
securing
more
advanced
positions
for
all
our
troops
where
they
were
fully
covered
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
the
and
were
spent
in
strengthening
our
position
and
in
making
roads
in
rear
of
the
army
from
yazoo
river
or
chickasaw
bayou
most
of
the
army
had
now
been
for
three
weeks
with
only
five
days
rations
issued
by
the
commissary
they
had
an
abundance
of
food
however
but
began
to
feel
the
want
of
bread
i
remember
that
in
passing
around
to
the
left
of
the
line
on
the
a
soldier
recognizing
me
said
in
rather
a
low
voice
but
yet
so
that
i
heard
him
hard
tack
in
a
moment
the
cry
was
taken
up
all
along
the
line
hard
tack
hard
tack
i
told
the
men
nearest
to
me
that
we
had
been
engaged
ever
since
the
arrival
of
the
troops
in
building
a
road
over
which
to
supply
them
with
everything
they
needed
the
cry
was
instantly
changed
to
cheers
by
the
night
of
the
all
the
troops
had
full
rations
issued
to
them
the
bread
and
coffee
were
highly
appreciated
i
now
determined
on
a
second
assault
johnston
was
in
my
rear
only
fifty
miles
away
with
an
army
not
much
inferior
in
numbers
to
the
one
i
had
with
me
and
i
knew
he
was
being
reinforced
there
was
danger
of
his
coming
to
the
assistance
of
pemberton
and
after
all
he
might
defeat
my
anticipations
of
capturing
the
garrison
if
indeed
he
did
not
prevent
the
capture
of
the
city
the
immediate
capture
of
vicksburg
would
save
sending
me
the
reinforcements
which
were
so
much
wanted
elsewhere
and
would
set
free
the
army
under
me
to
drive
johnston
from
the
state
but
the
first
consideration
of
all
was
the
troops
believed
they
could
carry
the
works
in
their
front
and
would
not
have
worked
so
patiently
in
the
trenches
if
they
had
not
been
allowed
to
try
the
attack
was
ordered
to
commence
on
all
parts
of
the

with
a

cannonade
from
every
battery
in
position
all
the
corps
commanders
set
their
time
by
mine
so
that
all
might
open
the
engagement
at
the
same
minute
the
attack
was
gallant
and
portions
of
each
of
the
three
corps
succeeded
in
getting
up
to
the
very
parapets
of
the
enemy
and
in
planting
their
battle
flags
upon
them
but
at
no
place
were
we
able
to
enter
general
mcclernand
reported
that
he
had
gained
the
enemy
intrenchments
at
several
points
and
wanted
reinforcements
i
occupied
a
position
from
which
i
believed
i
could
see
as
well
as
he
what
took
place
in
his
front
and
i
did
not
see
the
success
he
reported
but
his
request
for
reinforcements
being
repeated
i
could
not
ignore
it
and
sent
him
quinby
division
of
the
corps
sherman
and
mcpherson
were
both
ordered
to
renew
their
assaults
as
a
diversion
in
favor
of
mcclernand
this
last
attack
only
served
to
increase
our
casualties
without
giving
any
benefit
whatever
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
our
troops
that
had
reached
the
enemy
line
and
been
obliged
to
remain
there
for
security
all
day
were
withdrawn
and
thus
ended
the
last
assault
upon
vicksburg
chapter
xxxvii
siege
of
vicksburg
i
now
determined
upon
a
regular
siege
to
the
enemy
as
it
were
and
to
incur
no
more
losses
the
experience
of
the
convinced
officers
and
men
that
this
was
best
and
they
went
to
work
on
the
defences
and
approaches
with
a
will
with
the
navy
holding
the
river
the
investment
of
vicksburg
was
complete
as
long
as
we
could
hold
our
position
the
enemy
was
limited
in
supplies
of
food
men
and
munitions
of
war
to
what
they
had
on
hand
these
could
not
last
always
the
crossing
of
troops
at
bruinsburg
commenced
april
on
the
of
may
the
army
was
in
rear
of
vicksburg
on
the
just
twenty
days
after
the
crossing
the
city
was
completely
invested
and
an
assault
had
been
made
five
distinct
battles
besides
continuous
skirmishing
had
been
fought
and
won
by
the

forces
the
capital
of
the
state
had
fallen
and
its
arsenals
military
manufactories
and
everything
useful
for
military
purposes
had
been
destroyed
an
average
of
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
had
been
marched
by
the
troops
engaged
but
five
days
rations
had
been
issued
and
no

over
six
thousand
prisoners
had
been
captured
and
as
many
more
of

had
been
killed
or
wounded

and
had
fallen
into
our
hands
and
four
hundred
miles
of
the

to

had
become
ours
the
union
force
that
had
crossed
the
mississippi

up
to
this
time
was
less
than
thousand

of

only
arrived
in

on
the
roads
between
these
places
over
sixty
thousand
men
they
were
in
their
own
country
where
no
rear
guards
were
necessary
the
country
is
admirable
for
defence
but
difficult
for
the
conduct
of
an
offensive
campaign
all
their
troops
had
to
be
met
we
were
fortunate
to
say
the
least
in
meeting
them
in

had
been
completed
from

and
chickasaw
bayou
around
the

of
the
army
to
enable

to
bring
up

ground
had
been
selected
and
cleared
on
which
the
troops
were
to
be
encamped
and
tents
and
cooking
utensils
were
brought
up
the

had
been
without

from

all
was
now
ready
for
the
pick
and
spade
prentiss
and
hurlbut
were
ordered
to
send
forward
every
man
that
could
be
spared
cavalry
especially
was
wanted
to
watch
the
fords
along
the
big
black
and
to
observe
johnston
i
knew
that
johnston
was
receiving
reinforcements
from
bragg
who
was
confronting
rosecrans
in
tennessee
vicksburg
was
so
important
to
the
enemy
that
i
believed
he
would
make
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
raise
the
siege
even
at
the
risk
of
losing
ground
elsewhere
my
line
was
more
than
fifteen
miles
long
extending
from
haines
bluff
to
vicksburg
thence
to
warrenton
the
line
of
the
enemy
was
about
seven
in
addition
to
this
having
an
enemy
at
canton
and
jackson
in
our
rear
who
was
being
constantly
reinforced
we
required
a
second
line
of
defence
facing
the
other
way
i
had
not
troops
enough
under
my
command
to
man
these
general
halleck
appreciated
the
situation
and
without
being
asked
forwarded
reinforcements
with
all
possible
dispatch
the
ground
about
vicksburg
is
admirable
for
defence
on
the
north
it
is
about
two
hundred
feet
above
the
mississippi
river
at
the
highest
point
and
very
much
cut
up
by
the
washing
rains
the
ravines
were
grown
up
with
cane
and
underbrush
while
the
sides
and
tops
were
covered
with
a
dense
forest
farther
south
the
ground
flattens
out
somewhat
and
was
in
cultivation
but
here
too
it
was
cut
up
by
ravines
and
small
streams
the
enemy
line
of
defence
followed
the
crest
of
a
ridge
from
the
river
north
of
the
city
eastward
then
southerly
around
to
the
jackson
road
full
three
miles
back
of
the
city
thence
in
a
southwesterly
direction
to
the
river
deep
ravines
of
the
description
given
lay
in
front
of
these
defences
as
there
is
a
succession
of
gullies
cut
out
by
rains
along
the
side
of
the
ridge
the
line
was
necessarily
very
irregular
to
follow
each
of
these
spurs
with
intrenchments
so
as
to
command
the
slopes
on
either
side
would
have
lengthened
their
line
very
much
generally
therefore
or
in
many
places
their
line
would
run
from
near
the
head
of
one
gully
nearly
straight
to
the
head
of
another
and
an
outer
work
triangular
in
shape
generally
open
in
the
rear
was
thrown
up
on
the
point
with
a
few
men
in
this
outer
work
they
commanded
the
approaches
to
the
main
line
completely
the
work
to
be
done
to
make
our
position
as
strong
against
the
enemy
as
his
was
against
us
was
very
great
the
problem
was
also
complicated
by
our
wanting
our
line
as
near
that
of
the
enemy
as
possible
we
had
but
four
engineer
officers
with
us
captain
prime
of
the
engineer
corps
was
the
chief
and
the
work
at
the
beginning
was
mainly
directed
by
him
his
health
soon
gave
out
when
he
was
succeeded
by
captain
comstock
also
of
the
engineer
corps
to
provide
assistants
on
such
a
long
line
i
directed
that
all
officers
who
had
graduated
at
west
point
where
they
had
necessarily
to
study
military
engineering
should
in
addition
to
their
other
duties
assist
in
the
work
the
chief
quartermaster
and
the
chief
commissary
were
graduates
the
chief
commissary
now
the
of
the
army
begged
off
however
saying
that
there
was
nothing
in
engineering
that
he
was
good
for
unless
he
would
do
for
a
as
soldiers
require
rations
while
working
in
the
ditches
as
well
as
when
marching
and
fighting
and
as
we
would
be
sure
to
lose
him
if
he
was
used
as
a
i
let
him
off
the
general
is
a
large
man
weighs
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
and
is
not
tall
we
had
no
siege
guns
except
six
pounders
and
there
were
none
at
the
west
to
draw
from
admiral
porter
however
supplied
us
with
a
battery
of
of
large
calibre
and
with
these
and
the
field
artillery
used
in
the
campaign
the
siege
began
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
get
the
artillery
in
batteries
where
they
would
occupy
commanding
positions
then
establish
the
camps
under
cover
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
but
as
near
up
as
possible
and
then
construct
and
covered
ways
to
connect
the
entire
command
by
the
shortest
route
the
enemy
did
not
harass
us
much
while
we
were
constructing
our
batteries
probably
their
artillery
ammunition
was
short
and
their
infantry
was
kept
down
by
our
sharpshooters
who
were
always
on
the
alert
and
ready
to
fire
at
a
head
whenever
it
showed
itself
above
the
rebel
works
in
no
place
were
our
lines
more
than
six
hundred
yards
from
the
enemy
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
cover
our
men
by
something
more
than
the
ordinary
parapet
to
give
additional
protection
sand
bags
were
placed
along
the
tops
of
the
parapets
far
enough
apart
to
make
for
musketry
on
top
of
these
logs
were
put
by
these
means
the
men
were
enabled
to
walk
about
erect
when
off
duty
without
fear
of
annoyance
from
sharpshooters
the
enemy
used
in
their
defence
explosive
no
doubt
thinking
that
bursting
over
our
men
in
the
trenches
they
would
do
some
execution
but
i
do
not
remember
a
single
case
where
a
man
was
injured
by
a
piece
of
one
of
these
shells
when
they
were
hit
and
the
ball
exploded
the
wound
was
terrible
in
these
cases
a
solid
ball
would
have
hit
as
well
their
use
is
barbarous
because
they
produce
increased
suffering
without
any
corresponding
advantage
to
those
using
them
the
enemy
could
not
resort
to
our
method
to
protect
their
men
because
we
had
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
ammunition
to
draw
upon
and
used
it
freely
splinters
from
the
timber
would
have
made
havoc
among
the
men
behind
there
were
no
mortars
with
the
besiegers
except
what
the
navy
had
in
front
of
the
city
but
wooden
ones
were
made
by
taking
logs
of
the
toughest
wood
that
could
be
found
boring
them
out
for
six
or
twelve
pound
shells
and
binding
them
with
strong
iron
bands
these
answered
as
cochorns
and
shells
were
successfully
thrown
from
them
into
the
trenches
of
the
enemy
the
labor
of
building
the
batteries
and
intrenching
was
largely
done
by
the
pioneers
assisted
by
negroes
who
came
within
our
lines
and
who
were
paid
for
their
work
but
details
from
the
troops
had
often
to
be
made
the
work
was
pushed
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
when
an
advanced
position
was
secured
and
covered
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
the
batteries
were
advanced
by
the
of
june
there
were
two
hundred
and
twenty
guns
in
position
mostly
light
besides
a
battery
of
heavy
guns
belonging
to
manned
and
commanded
by
the
navy
we
were
now
as
strong
for
defence
against
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
as
they
were
against
us
but
i
knew
that
johnston
was
in
our
rear
and
was
receiving
constant
reinforcements
from
the
east
he
had
at
this
time
a
larger
force
than
i
had
had
at
any
time
prior
to
the
battle
of
champion
hill
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
union
army
behind
vicksburg
reached
the
north
floods
of
visitors
began
to
pour
in
some
came
to
gratify
curiosity
some
to
see
sons
or
brothers
who
had
passed
through
the
terrible
ordeal
members
of
the
christian
and
sanitary
associations
came
to
minister
to
the
wants
of
the
sick
and
the
wounded
often
those
coming
to
see
a
son
or
brother
would
bring
a
dozen
or
two
of
poultry
they
did
not
know
how
little
the
gift
would
be
appreciated
many
of
the
soldiers
had
lived
so
much
on
chickens
ducks
and
turkeys
without
bread
during
the
march
that
the
sight
of
poultry
if
they
could
get
bacon
almost
took
away
their
appetite
but
the
intention
was
good
among
the
earliest
arrivals
was
the
governor
of
illinois
with
most
of
the
state
officers
i
naturally
wanted
to
show
them
what
there
was
of
most
interest
in
sherman
front
the
ground
was
the
most
broken
and
most
wooded
and
more
was
to
be
seen
without
exposure
i
therefore
took
them
to
sherman
headquarters
and
presented
them
before
starting
out
to
look
at
the
lines
possibly
while
sherman
horse
was
being
saddled
there
were
many
questions
asked
about
the
late
campaign
about
which
the
north
had
been
so
imperfectly
informed
there
was
a
little
knot
around
sherman
and
another
around
me
and
i
heard
sherman
repeating
in
the
most
animated
manner
what
he
had
said
to
me
when
we
first
looked
down
from
walnut
hills
upon
the
land
below
on
the
of
may
adding
grant
is
entitled
to
every
bit
of
the
credit
for
the
campaign
i
opposed
it
i
wrote
him
a
letter
about
it
but
for
this
speech
it
is
not
likely
that
sherman
opposition
would
have
ever
been
heard
of
his
untiring
energy
and
great
efficiency
during
the
campaign
entitle
him
to
a
full
share
of
all
the
credit
due
for
its
success
he
could
not
have
done
more
if
the
plan
had
been
his
own
on
the
of
may
i
sent
blair
division
up
the
yazoo
to
drive
out
a
force
of
the
enemy
supposed
to
be
between
the
big
black
and
the
yazoo
the
country
was
rich
and
full
of
supplies
of
both
food
and
forage
blair
was
instructed
to
take
all
of
it
the
cattle
were
to
be
driven
in
for
the
use
of
our
army
and
the
food
and
forage
to
be
consumed
by
our
troops
or
destroyed
by
fire
all
bridges
were
to
be
destroyed
and
the
roads
rendered
as
nearly
impassable
as
possible
blair
went
miles
and
was
gone
almost
a
week
his
work
was
effectually
done
i
requested
porter
at
this
time
to
send
the
marine
brigade
a
floating
nondescript
force
which
had
been
assigned
to
his
command
and
which
proved
very
useful
up
to
haines
bluff
to
hold
it
until
reinforcements
could
be
sent
on
the
i
also
received
a
letter
from
banks
asking
me
to
reinforce
him
with
ten
thousand
men
at
port
hudson
of
course
i
could
not
comply
with
his
request
nor
did
i
think
he
needed
them
he
was
in
no
danger
of
an
attack
by
the
garrison
in
his
front
and
there
was
no
army
organizing
in
his
rear
to
raise
the
siege
on
the
of
june
a
brigade
from
hurlbut
command
arrived
general
kimball
commanding
it
was
sent
to
mechanicsburg
some
miles
of
haines
bluff
and
about
midway
between
the
big
black
and
the
yazoo
a
brigade
of
blair
division
and
twelve
hundred
cavalry
had
already
on
blair
return
from
the
yazoo
been
sent
to
the
same
place
with
instructions
to
watch
the
crossings
of
the
big
black
river
to
destroy
the
roads
in
his
blair
front
and
to
gather
or
destroy
all
supplies
on
the
of
june
our
little
force
of
colored
and
white
troops
across
the
mississippi
at
milliken
bend
were
attacked
by
about
men
from
richard
taylor
command
with
the
aid
of
the
gunboats
they
were
speedily
repelled
i
sent
mower
brigade
over
with
instructions
to
drive
the
enemy
beyond
the
tensas
bayou
and
we
had
no
further
trouble
in
that
quarter
during
the
siege
this
was
the
first
important
engagement
of
the
war
in
which
colored
troops
were
under
fire
these
men
were
very
raw
having
all
been
enlisted
since
the
beginning
of
the
siege
but
they
behaved
well
on
the
of
june
a
full
division
arrived
from
hurlbut
command
under
general
sooy
smith
it
was
sent
immediately
to
haines
bluff
and
general
washburn
was
assigned
to
the
general
command
at
that
point
on
the
a
strong
division
arrived
from
the
department
of
the
missouri
under
general
herron
which
was
placed
on
our
left
this
cut
off
the
last
possible
chance
of
communication
between
pemberton
and
johnston
as
it
enabled
lauman
to
close
up
on
mcclernand
left
while
herron
intrenched
from
lauman
to
the
water
edge
at
this
point
the
water
recedes
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
high
land
through
this
opening
no
doubt
the
confederate
commanders
had
been
able
to
get
messengers
under
cover
of
night
on
the
general
parke
arrived
with
two
divisions
of
corps
and
was
immediately
dispatched
to
haines
bluff
these
latter
troops
herron
and
parke
were
the
reinforcements
already
spoken
of
sent
by
halleck
in
anticipation
of
their
being
needed
they
arrived
none
too
soon
i
now
had
about
thousand
men
more
than
half
were
disposed
across
the
peninsula
between
the
yazoo
at
haines
bluff
and
the
big
black
with
the
division
of
osterhaus
watching
the
crossings
of
the
latter
river
farther
south
and
west
from
the
crossing
of
the
jackson
road
to
baldwin
ferry
and
below
there
were
eight
roads
leading
into
vicksburg
along
which
and
their
immediate
sides
our
work
was
specially
pushed
and
batteries
advanced
but
no
commanding
point
within
range
of
the
enemy
was
neglected
on
the
i
received
a
letter
from
general
sherman
and
one
on
the
from
general
mcpherson
saying
that
their
respective
commands
had
complained
to
them
of
a
fulsome
congratulatory
order
published
by
general
mcclernand
to
the
corps
which
did
great
injustice
to
the
other
troops
engaged
in
the
campaign
this
order
had
been
sent
north
and
published
and
now
papers
containing
it
had
reached
our
camps
the
order
had
not
been
heard
of
by
me
and
certainly
not
by
troops
outside
of
mcclernand
command
until
brought
in
this
way
i
at
once
wrote
to
mcclernand
directing
him
to
send
me
a
copy
of
this
order
he
did
so
and
i
at
once
relieved
him
from
the
command
of
the
army
corps
and
ordered
him
back
to
springfield
illinois
the
publication
of
his
order
in
the
press
was
in
violation
of
war
department
orders
and
also
of

explosion
of

the

meeting
with
pemberton
negotiations
for
surrender
accepting
the
terms
surrender
of
vicksburg
on
the
of
june
positive
information
was
received
that
johnston
had
crossed
the
big
black
river
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
our
rear
to
raise
the
siege
and
release
pemberton
the
correspondence
between
johnston
and
pemberton
shows
that
all
expectation
of
holding
vicksburg
had
by
this
time
passed
from
johnston
mind
i
immediately
ordered
sherman
to
the
command
of
all
the
forces
from
haines
bluff
to
the
big
black
river
this
amounted
now
to
quite
half
the
troops
about
vicksburg
besides
these
herron
and
smith
divisions
were
ordered
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
reinforce
sherman
haines
bluff
had
been
strongly
fortified
on
the
land
side
and
on
all
commanding
points
from
there
to
the
big
black
at
the
railroad
crossing
batteries
had
been
constructed
the
work
of
connecting
by
where
this
was
not
already
done
was
an
easy
task
for
the
troops
that
were
to
defend
them
we
were
now
looking
west
besieging
pemberton
while
we
were
also
looking
east
to
defend
ourselves
against
an
expected
siege
by
johnston
but
as
against
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
we
were
as
substantially
protected
as
they
were
against
us
where
we
were
looking
east
and
north
we
were
strongly
fortified
and
on
the
defensive
johnston
evidently
took
in
the
situation
and
wisely
i
think
abstained
from
making
an
assault
on
us
because
it
would
simply
have
inflicted
loss
on
both
sides
without
accomplishing
any
result
we
were
strong
enough
to
have
taken
the
offensive
against
him
but
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
take
any
risk
of
losing
our
hold
upon
pemberton
army
while
i
would
have
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
of
defending
ourselves
against
an
attack
by
johnston
from
the
of
may
the
work
of
fortifying
and
pushing
forward
our
position
nearer
to
the
enemy
had
been
steadily
progressing
at
three
points
on
the
jackson
road
in
front
of
leggett
brigade
a
sap
was
run
up
to
the
enemy
parapet
and
by
the
of
june
we
had
it
undermined
and
the
mine
charged
the
enemy
had
countermined
but
did
not
succeed
in
reaching
our
mine
at
this
particular
point
the
hill
on
which
the
rebel
work
stands
rises
abruptly
our
sap
ran
close
up
to
the
outside
of
the
enemy
parapet
in
fact
this
parapet
was
also
our
protection
the
soldiers
of
the
two
sides
occasionally
conversed
pleasantly
across
this
barrier
sometimes
they
exchanged
the
hard
bread
of
the
union
soldiers
for
the
tobacco
of
the
confederates
at
other
times
the
enemy
threw
over
and
often
our
men
catching
them
in
their
hands
returned
them
our
mine
had
been
started
some
distance
back
down
the
hill
consequently
when
it
had
extended
as
far
as
the
parapet
it
was
many
feet
below
it
this
caused
the
failure
of
the
enemy
in
his
search
to
find
and
destroy
it
on
the
of
june
at
three
all
being
ready
the
mine
was
exploded
a
heavy
artillery
fire
all
along
the
line
had
been
ordered
to
open
with
the
explosion
the
effect
was
to
blow
the
top
of
the
hill
off
and
make
a
crater
where
it
stood
the
breach
was
not
sufficient
to
enable
us
to
pass
a
column
of
attack
through
in
fact
the
enemy
having
failed
to
reach
our
mine
had
thrown
up
a
line
farther
back
where
most
of
the
men
guarding
that
point
were
placed
there
were
a
few
men
however
left
at
the
advance
line
and
others
working
in
the
countermine
which
was
still
being
pushed
to
find
ours
all
that
were
there
were
thrown
into
the
air
some
of
them
coming
down
on
our
side
still
alive
i
remember
one
colored
man
who
had
been
under
ground
at
work
when
the
explosion
took
place
who
was
thrown
to
our
side
he
was
not
much
hurt
but
terribly
frightened
some
one
asked
him
how
high
he
had
gone
up
dun
no
massa
but
mile
was
his
reply
general
logan
commanded
at
this
point
and
took
this
colored
man
to
his
quarters
where
he
did
service
to
the
end
of
the
siege
as
soon
as
the
explosion
took
place
the
crater
was
seized
by
two
regiments
of
our
troops
who
were
near
by
under
cover
where
they
had
been
placed
for
the
express
purpose
the
enemy
made
a
desperate
effort
to
expel
them
but
failed
and
soon
retired
behind
the
new
line
from
here
however
they
threw
which
did
some
execution
the
compliment
was
returned
by
our
men
but
not
with
so
much
effect
the
enemy
could
lay
their
grenades
on
the
parapet
which
alone
divided
the
contestants
and
roll
them
down
upon
us
while
from
our
side
they
had
to
be
thrown
over
the
parapet
which
was
at
considerable
elevation
during
the
night
we
made
efforts
to
secure
our
position
in
the
crater
against
the
missiles
of
the
enemy
so
as
to
run
trenches
along
the
outer
base
of
their
parapet
right
and
left
but
the
enemy
continued
throwing
their
grenades
and
brought
boxes
of
field
ammunition
shells
the
fuses
of
which
they
would
light
with
portfires
and
throw
them
by
hand
into
our
ranks
we
found
it
impossible
to
continue
this
work
another
mine
was
consequently
started
which
was
exploded
on
the
of
july
destroying
an
entire
rebel
redan
killing
and
wounding
a
considerable
number
of
its
occupants
and
leaving
an
immense
chasm
where
it
stood
no
attempt
to
charge
was
made
this
time
the
experience
of
the
admonishing
us
our
loss
in
the
first
affair
was
about
thirty
killed
and
wounded
the
enemy
must
have
lost
more
in
the
two
explosions
than
we
did
in
the
first
we
lost
none
in
the
second
from
this
time
forward
the
work
of
mining
and
pushing
our
position
nearer
to
the
enemy
was
prosecuted
with
vigor
and
i
determined
to
explode
no
more
mines
until
we
were
ready
to
explode
a
number
at
different
points
and
assault
immediately
after
we
were
up
now
at
three
different
points
one
in
front
of
each
corps
to
where
only
the
parapet
of
the
enemy
divided
us
at
this
time
an
intercepted
dispatch
from
johnston
to
pemberton
informed
me
that
johnston
intended
to
make
a
determined
attack
upon
us
in
order
to
relieve
the
garrison
at
vicksburg
i
knew
the
garrison
would
make
no
formidable
effort
to
relieve
itself
the
picket
lines
were
so
close
to
each
other
where
there
was
space
enough
between
the
lines
to
post
pickets
that
the
men
could
converse
on
the
of
june
i
was
informed
through
this
means
that
pemberton
was
preparing
to
escape
by
crossing
to
the
louisiana
side
under
cover
of
night
that
he
had
employed
workmen
in
making
boats
for
that
purpose
that
the
men
had
been
canvassed
to
ascertain
if
they
would
make
an
assault
on
the
yankees
to
cut
their
way
out
that
they
had
refused
and
almost
mutinied
because
their
commander
would
not
surrender
and
relieve
their
sufferings
and
had
only
been
pacified
by
the
assurance
that
boats
enough
would
be
finished
in
a
week
to
carry
them
all
over
the
rebel
pickets
also
said
that
houses
in
the
city
had
been
pulled
down
to
get
material
to
build
these
boats
with
afterwards
this
story
was
verified
on
entering
the
city
we
found
a
large
number
of
very
rudely
constructed
boats
all
necessary
steps
were
at
once
taken
to
render
such
an
attempt
abortive
our
pickets
were
doubled
admiral
porter
was
notified
so
that
the
river
might
be
more
closely
watched
material
was
collected
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
to
be
set
on
fire
and
light
up
the
river
if
the
attempt
was
made
and
batteries
were
established
along
the
levee
crossing
the
peninsula
on
the
louisiana
side
had
the
attempt
been
made
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
would
have
been
drowned
or
made
prisoners
on
the
louisiana
side
general
richard
taylor
was
expected
on
the
west
bank
to
in
this
movement
i
believe
but
he
did
not
come
nor
could
he
have
done
so
with
a
force
sufficient
to
be
of
service
the
mississippi
was
now
in
our
possession
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
except
in
the
immediate
front
of
vicksburg
and
of
port
hudson
we
had
nearly
exhausted
the
country
along
a
line
drawn
from
lake
providence
to
opposite
bruinsburg
the
roads
west
were
not
of
a
character
to
draw
supplies
over
for
any
considerable
force
by
the
of
july
our
approaches
had
reached
the
enemy
ditch
at
a
number
of
places
at
ten
points
we
could
move
under
cover
to
within
from
five
to
one
hundred
yards
of
the
enemy
orders
were
given
to
make
all
preparations
for
assault
on
the
of
july
the
debouches
were
ordered
widened
to
afford
easy
egress
while
the
approaches
were
also
to
be
widened
to
admit
the
troops
to
pass
through
four
abreast
plank
and
bags
filled
with
cotton
packed
in
tightly
were
ordered
prepared
to
enable
the
troops
to
cross
the
ditches
on
the
night
of
the
of
july
johnston
was
between
brownsville
and
the
big
black
and
wrote
pemberton
from
there
that
about
the
of
the
month
an
attempt
would
be
made
to
create
a
diversion
to
enable
him
to
cut
his
way
out
pemberton
was
a
prisoner
before
this
message
reached
him
on
july
pemberton
seeing
no
hope
of
outside
relief
addressed
the
following
letter
to
each
of
his
four
division
commanders
unless
the
siege
of
vicksburg
is
raised
or
supplies
are
thrown
in
it
will
become
necessary
very
shortly
to
evacuate
the
place
i
see
no
prospect
of
the
former
and
there
are
many
great
if
not
insuperable
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
latter
you
are
therefore
requested
to
inform
me
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
as
to
the
condition
of
your
troops
and
their
ability
to
make
the
marches
and
undergo
the
fatigues
necessary
to
accomplish
a
successful
evacuation
two
of
his
generals
suggested
surrender
and
the
other
two
practically
did
the
same
they
expressed
the
opinion
that
an
attempt
to
evacuate
would
fail
pemberton
had
previously
got
a
message
to
johnston
suggesting
that
he
should
try
to
negotiate
with
me
for
a
release
of
the
garrison
with
their
arms
johnston
replied
that
it
would
be
a
confession
of
weakness
for
him
to
do
so
but
he
authorized
pemberton
to
use
his
name
in
making
such
an
arrangement
on
the
about
ten
white
flags
appeared
on
a
portion
of
the
rebel
works
hostilities
along
that
part
of
the
line
ceased
at
once
soon
two
persons
were
seen
coming
towards
our
lines
bearing
a
white
flag
they
proved
to
be
general
bowen
a
division
commander
and
colonel
montgomery
to
pemberton
bearing
the
following
letter
to
me
i
have
the
honor
to
propose
an
armistice
for
hours
with
the
view
to
arranging
terms
for
the
capitulation
of
vicksburg
to
this
end
if
agreeable
to
you
i
will
appoint
three
commissioners
to
meet
a
like
number
to
be
named
by
yourself
at
such
place
and
hour
as
you
may
find
convenient
i
make
this
proposition
to
save
the
further
effusion
of
blood
which
must
otherwise
be
shed
to
a
frightful
extent
feeling
myself
fully
able
to
maintain
my
position
for
a
yet
indefinite
period
this
communication
will
be
handed
you
under
a
flag
of
truce
by
john
s
bowen
it
was
a
glorious
sight
to
officers
and
soldiers
on
the
line
where
these
white
flags
were
visible
and
the
news
soon
spread
to
all
parts
of
the
command
the
troops
felt
that
their
long
and
weary
marches
hard
fighting
ceaseless
watching
by
night
and
day
in
a
hot
climate
exposure
to
all
sorts
of
weather
to
diseases
and
worst
of
all
to
the
gibes
of
many
northern
papers
that
came
to
them
saying
all
their
suffering
was
in
vain
that
vicksburg
would
never
be
taken
were
at
last
at
an
end
and
the
union
sure
to
be
saved
bowen
was
received
by
general
smith
and
asked
to
see
me
i
had
been
a
neighbor
of
bowen
in
missouri
and
knew
him
well
and
favorably
before
the
war
but
his
request
was
refused
he
then
suggested
that
i
should
meet
pemberton
to
this
i
sent
a
verbal
message
saying
that
if
pemberton
desired
it
i
would
meet
him
in
front
of
mcpherson
corps
at
three
that
afternoon
i
also
sent
the
following
written
reply
to
pemberton
letter
your
note
of
this
date
is
just
received
proposing
an
armistice
for
several
hours
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
terms
of
capitulation
through
commissioners
to
be
appointed
etc
the
useless
effusion
of
blood
you
propose
stopping
by
this
course
can
be
ended
at
any
time
you
may
choose
by
the
unconditional
surrender
of
the
city
and
garrison
men
who
have
shown
so
much
endurance
and
courage
as
those
now
in
vicksburg
will
always
challenge
the
respect
of
an
adversary
and
i
can
assure
you
will
be
treated
with
all
the
respect
due
to
prisoners
of
war
i
do
not
favor
the
proposition
of
appointing
commissioners
to
arrange
the
terms
of
capitulation
because
i
have
no
terms
other
than
those
indicated
above
at
three
pemberton
appeared
at
the
point
suggested
in
my
verbal
message
accompanied
by
the
same
officers
who
had
borne
his
letter
of
the
morning
generals
ord
mcpherson
logan
and
smith
and
several
officers
of
my
staff
accompanied
me
our
place
of
meeting
was
on
a
hillside
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
rebel
lines
near
by
stood
a
stunted
which
was
made
historical
by
the
event
it
was
but
a
short
time
before
the
last
vestige
of
its
body
root
and
limb
had
disappeared
the
fragments
taken
as
trophies
since
then
the
same
tree
has
furnished
as
many
cords
of
wood
in
the
shape
of
trophies
as
the
true
cross
pemberton
and
i
had
served
in
the
same
division
during
part
of
the
mexican
war
i
knew
him
very
well
therefore
and
greeted
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
he
soon
asked
what
terms
i
proposed
to
give
his
army
if
it
surrendered
my
answer
was
the
same
as
proposed
in
my
reply
to
his
letter
pemberton
then
said
rather
snappishly
the
conference
might
as
well
end
and
turned
abruptly
as
if
to
leave
i
said
very
well
general
bowen
i
saw
was
very
anxious
that
the
surrender
should
be
consummated
his
manner
and
remarks
while
pemberton
and
i
were
talking
showed
this
he
now
proposed
that
he
and
one
of
our
generals
should
have
a
conference
i
had
no
objection
to
this
as
nothing
could
be
made
binding
upon
me
that
they
might
propose
smith
and
bowen
accordingly
had
a
conference
during
which
pemberton
and
i
moving
a
short
distance
away
towards
the
enemy
lines
were
in
conversation
after
a
while
bowen
suggested
that
the
confederate
army
should
be
allowed
to
march
out
with
the
honors
of
war
carrying
their
small
arms
and
field
artillery
this
was
promptly
and
unceremoniously
rejected
the
interview
here
ended
i
agreeing
however
to
send
a
letter
giving
final
terms
by
ten
that
night
word
was
sent
to
admiral
porter
soon
after
the
correspondence
with
pemberton
commenced
so
that
hostilities
might
be
stopped
on
the
part
of
both
army
and
navy
it
was
agreed
on
my
paging
with
pemberton
that
they
should
not
be
renewed
until
our
correspondence
ceased
when
i
returned
to
my
headquarters
i
sent
for
all
the
corps
and
division
commanders
with
the
army
immediately
confronting
vicksburg
half
the
army
was
from
eight
to
twelve
miles
off
waiting
for
johnston
i
informed
them
of
the
contents
of
pemberton
letters
of
my
reply
and
the
substance
of
the
interview
and
that
i
was
ready
to
hear
any
suggestion
but
would
hold
the
power
of
deciding
entirely
in
my
own
hands
this
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
council
of
war
i
ever
held
against
the
general
and
almost
unanimous
judgment
of
the
council
i
sent
the
following
letter
in
conformity
with
agreement
of
this
afternoon
i
will
submit
the
following
proposition
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
of
vicksburg
public
stores
etc
on
your
accepting
the
terms
proposed
i
will
march
in
one
division
as
a
guard
and
take
possession
at
eight
as
soon
as
rolls
can
be
made
out
and
paroles
be
signed
by
officers
and
men
you
will
be
allowed
to
march
out
of
our
lines
the
officers
taking
with
them
their
and
clothing
and
the
field
staff
and
cavalry
officers
one
horse
each
the
rank
and
file
will
be
allowed
all
their
clothing
but
no
other
property
if
these
conditions
are
accepted
any
amount
of
rations
you
may
deem
necessary
can
be
taken
from
the
stores
you
now
have
and
also
the
necessary
cooking
utensils
for
preparing
them
thirty
wagons
also
counting
two
or
mule
teams
as
one
will
be
allowed
to
transport
such
articles
as
can
not
be
carried
along
the
same
conditions
will
be
allowed
to
all
sick
and
wounded
officers
and
soldiers
as
fast
as
they
become
able
to
travel
the
paroles
for
these
latter
must
be
signed
however
whilst
officers
present
are
authorized
to
sign
the
roll
of
prisoners
by
the
terms
of
the
cartel
then
in
force
prisoners
captured
by
either
army
were
required
to
be
forwarded
as
soon
as
possible
to
either
landing
below
dutch
gap
on
the
james
river
or
to
vicksburg
there
to
be
exchanged
or
paroled
until
they
could
be
exchanged
there
was
a
confederate
commissioner
at
vicksburg
authorized
to
make
the
exchange
i
did
not
propose
to
take
him
a
prisoner
but
to
leave
him
free
to
perform
the
functions
of
his
office
had
i
insisted
upon
an
unconditional
surrender
there
would
have
been
over
thirty
thousand
men
to
transport
to
cairo
very
much
to
the
inconvenience
of
the
army
on
the
mississippi
thence
the
prisoners
would
have
had
to
be
transported
by
rail
to
washington
or
baltimore
thence
again
by
steamer
to
aiken
all
at
very
great
expense
at
aiken
they
would
have
had
to
be
paroled
because
the
confederates
did
not
have
union
prisoners
to
give
in
exchange
then
again
pemberton
army
was
largely
composed
of
men
whose
homes
were
in
the
i
knew
many
of
them
were
tired
of
the
war
and
would
get
home
just
as
soon
as
they
could
a
large
number
of
them
had
voluntarily
come
into
our
lines
during
the
siege
and
requested
to
be
sent
north
where
they
could
get
employment
until
the
war
was
over
and
they
could
go
to
their
homes
late
at
night
i
received
the
following
reply
to
my
last
letter
i
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
communication
of
this
date
proposing
terms
of
capitulation
for
this
garrison
and
post
in
the
main
your
terms
are
accepted
but
in
justice
both
to
the
honor
and
spirit
of
my
troops
manifested
in
the
defence
of
vicksburg
i
have
to
submit
the
following
amendments
which
if
acceded
to
by
you
will
perfect
the
agreement
between
us
at
ten
i
propose
to
evacuate
the
works
in
and
around
vicksburg
and
to
surrender
the
city
and
garrison
under
my
command
by
marching
out
with
my
colors
and
arms
stacking
them
in
front
of
my
present
lines
after
which
you
will
take
possession
officers
to
retain
their
and
personal
property
and
the
rights
and
property
of
citizens
to
be
respected
this
was
received
after
midnight
my
reply
was
as
follows
i
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
communication
of
july
the
amendment
proposed
by
you
can
not
be
acceded
to
in
full
it
will
be
necessary
to
furnish
every
officer
and
man
with
a
parole
signed
by
himself
which
with
the
completion
of
the
roll
of
prisoners
will
necessarily
take
some
time
again
i
can
make
no
stipulations
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
citizens
and
their
private
property
while
i
do
not
propose
to
cause
them
any
undue
annoyance
or
loss
i
can
not
consent
to
leave
myself
under
any
restraint
by
stipulations
the
property
which
officers
will
be
allowed
to
take
with
them
will
be
as
stated
in
my
proposition
of
last
evening
that
is
officers
will
be
allowed
their
private
baggage
and
and
mounted
officers
one
horse
each
if
you
mean
by
your
proposition
for
each
brigade
to
march
to
the
front
of
the
lines
now
occupied
by
it
and
stack
arms
at
ten
and
then
return
to
the
inside
and
there
remain
as
prisoners
until
properly
paroled
i
will
make
no
objection
to
it
should
no
notification
be
received
of
your
acceptance
of
my
terms
by
nine
i
shall
regard
them
as
having
been
rejected
and
shall
act
accordingly
should
these
terms
be
accepted
white
flags
should
be
displayed
along
your
lines
to
prevent
such
of
my
troops
as
may
not
have
been
notified
from
firing
upon
your
men
pemberton
promptly
accepted
these
terms
during
the
siege
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
friendly
sparring
between
the
soldiers
of
the
two
armies
on
picket
and
where
the
lines
were
close
together
all
rebels
were
known
as
johnnies
all
union
troops
as
yanks
often
johnny
would
call
well
yank
when
are
you
coming
into
town
the
reply
was
sometimes
we
propose
to
celebrate
the
of
july
there
sometimes
it
would
be
we
always
treat
our
prisoners
with
kindness
and
do
not
want
to
hurt
them
or
we
are
holding
you
as
prisoners
of
war
while
you
are
feeding
yourselves
the
garrison
from
the
commanding
general
down
undoubtedly
expected
an
assault
on
the
fourth
they
knew
from
the
temper
of
their
men
it
would
be
successful
when
made
and
that
would
be
a
greater
humiliation
than
to
surrender
besides
it
would
be
attended
with
severe
loss
to
them
the
vicksburg
paper
which
we
received
regularly
through
the
courtesy
of
the
rebel
pickets
said
prior
to
the
fourth
in
speaking
of
the
yankee
boast
that
they
would
take
dinner
in
vicksburg
that
day
that
the
best
receipt
for
cooking
a
rabbit
was
first
ketch
your
rabbit
the
paper
at
this
time
and
for
some
time
previous
was
printed
on
the
plain
side
of
wall
paper
the
last
number
was
issued
on
the
fourth
and
announced
that
we
had
caught
our
rabbit
i
have
no
doubt
that
pemberton
commenced
his
correspondence
on
the
third
with
a
purpose
first
to
avoid
an
assault
which
he
knew
would
be
successful
and
second
to
prevent
the
capture
taking
place
on
the
great
national
holiday
the
anniversary
of
the
declaration
of
american
independence
holding
out
for
better
terms
as
he
did
he
defeated
his
aim
in
the
latter
particular
at
the
appointed
hour
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
marched
out
of
their
works
and
formed
line
in
front
stacked
arms
and
marched
back
in
good
order
our
whole
army
present
witnessed
this
scene
without
cheering
logan
division
which
had
approached
nearest
the
rebel
works
was
the
first
to
march
in
and
the
flag
of
one
of
the
regiments
of
his
division
was
soon
floating
over
the
our
soldiers
were
no
sooner
inside
the
lines
than
the
two
armies
began
to
fraternize
our
men
had
had
full
rations
from
the
time
the
siege
commenced
to
the
close
the
enemy
had
been
suffering
particularly
towards
the
last
i
myself
saw
our
men
taking
bread
from
their
haversacks
and
giving
it
to
the
enemy
they
had
so
recently
been
engaged
in
starving
out
it
was
accepted
with
avidity
and
with
thanks
pemberton
says
in
his
report
if
it
should
be
asked
why
the
of
july
was
selected
as
the
day
for
surrender
the
answer
is
obvious
i
believed
that
upon
that
day
i
should
obtain
better
terms
well
aware
of
the
vanity
of
our
foe
i
knew
they
would
attach
vast
importance
to
the
entrance
on
the
of
july
into
the
stronghold
of
the
great
river
and
that
to
gratify
their
national
vanity
they
would
yield
then
what
could
not
be
extorted
from
them
at
any
other
time
this
does
not
support
my
view
of
his
reasons
for
selecting
the
day
he
did
for
surrendering
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
his
first
letter
asking
terms
was
received
about
july
it
then
could
hardly
be
expected
that
it
would
take
hours
to
effect
a
surrender
he
knew
that
johnston
was
in
our
rear
for
the
purpose
of
raising
the
siege
and
he
naturally
would
want
to
hold
out
as
long
as
he
could
he
knew
his
men
would
not
resist
an
assault
and
one
was
expected
on
the
fourth
in
our
interview
he
told
me
he
had
rations
enough
to
hold
out
for
some
time
my
recollection
is
two
weeks
it
was
this
statement
that
induced
me
to
insert
in
the
terms
that
he
was
to
draw
rations
for
his
men
from
his
own
supplies
on
the
of
july
general
holmes
with
an
army
of
eight
or
nine
thousand
men
belonging
to
the
department
made
an
attack
upon
helena
arkansas
he
was
totally
defeated
by
general
prentiss
who
was
holding
helena
with
less
than
hundred
soldiers
holmes
reported
his
loss
at
of
which
were
killed
but
as
prentiss
buried
holmes
evidently
understated
his
losses
the
union
loss
was
killed
wounded
and
between
and
missing
this
was
the
last
effort
on
the
part
of
the
confederacy
to
raise
the
siege
of
vicksburg
on
the
third
as
soon
as
negotiations
were
commenced
i
notified
sherman
and
directed
him
to
be
ready
to
take
the
offensive
against
johnston
drive
him
out
of
the
state
and
destroy
his
army
if
he
could
steele
and
ord
were
directed
at
the
same
time
to
be
in
readiness
to
join
sherman
as
soon
as
the
surrender
took
place
of
this
sherman
was
notified
i
rode
into
vicksburg
with
the
troops
and
went
to
the
river
to
exchange
congratulations
with
the
navy
upon
our
joint
victory
at
that
time
i
found
that
many
of
the
citizens
had
been
living
under
ground
the
ridges
upon
which
vicksburg
is
built
and
those
back
to
the
big
black
are
composed
of
a
deep
yellow
clay
of
great
tenacity
where
roads
and
streets
are
cut
through
perpendicular
banks
are
left
and
stand
as
well
as
if
composed
of
stone
the
magazines
of
the
enemy
were
made
by
running
into
this
clay
at
places
where
there
were
deep
cuts
many
citizens
secured
places
of
safety
for
their
families
by
carving
out
rooms
in
these
embankments
a
in
these
cases
would
be
cut
in
a
high
bank
starting
from
the
level
of
the
road
or
street
and
after
running
in
a
few
feet
a
room
of
the
size
required
was
carved
out
of
the
clay
the
dirt
being
removed
by
the
in
some
instances
i
saw
where
two
rooms
were
cut
out
for
a
single
family
with
a
in
the
clay
wall
separating
them
some
of
these
were
carpeted
and
furnished
with
considerable
elaboration
in
these
the
occupants
were
fully
secure
from
the
shells
of
the
navy
which
were
dropped
into
the
city
night
and
dav
without
intermission
i
returned
to
my
old
headquarters
outside
in
the
afternoon
and
did
not
move
into
the
town
until
the
sixth
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
i
sent
captain
wm
dunn
of
my
staff
to
cairo
the
nearest
point
where
the
telegraph
could
be
reached
with
a
dispatch
to
the
it
was
as
follows
the
enemy
surrendered
this
morning
the
only
terms
allowed
is
their
parole
as
prisoners
of
war
this
i
regard
as
a
great
advantage
to
us
at
this
moment
it
saves
probably
several
days
in
the
capture
and
leaves
troops
and
transports
ready
for
immediate
service
sherman
with
a
large
force
moves
immediately
on
johnston
to
drive
him
from
the
state
i
will
send
troops
to
the
relief
of
banks
and
return
the
army
corps
to
burnside
this
news
with
the
victory
at
gettysburg
won
the
same
day
lifted
a
great
load
of
anxiety
from
the
minds
of
the
president
his
cabinet
and
the
loyal
people
all
over
the
north
the
fate
of
the
confederacy
was
sealed
when
vicksburg
fell
much
hard
fighting
was
to
be
done
afterwards
and
many
precious
lives
were
to
be
sacrificed
but
the
morale
was
with
the
supporters
of
the
union
ever
after
i
at
the
same
time
wrote
to
general
banks
informing
him
of
the
fall
and
sending
him
a
copy
of
the
terms
also
saying
i
would
send
him
all
the
troops
he
wanted
to
insure
the
capture
of
the
only
foothold
the
enemy
now
had
on
the
mississippi
river
general
banks
had
a
number
of
copies
of
this
letter
printed
or
at
least
a
synopsis
of
it
and
very
soon
a
copy
fell
into
the
hands
of
general
gardner
who
was
then
in
command
of
port
hudson
gardner
at
once
sent
a
letter
to
the
commander
of
the
national
forces
saying
that
he
had
been
informed
of
the
surrender
of
vicksburg
and
telling
how
the
information
reached
him
he
added
that
if
this
was
true
it
was
useless
for
him
to
hold
out
longer
general
banks
gave
him
assurances
that
vicksburg
had
been
surrendered
and
general
gardner
surrendered
unconditionally
on
the
of
july
port
hudson
with
nearly
prisoners
guns
and
other
stores
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
union
forces
from
that
day
to
the
close
of
the
rebellion
the
mississippi
river
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
remained
in
the
control
of
the
national
troops
pemberton
and
his
army
were
kept
in
vicksburg
until
the
whole
could
be
paroled
the
paroles
were
in
duplicate
by
organization
one
copy
for
each
federals
and
confederates
and
signed
by
the
commanding
officers
of
the
companies
or
regiments
duplicates
were
also
made
for
each
soldier
and
signed
by
each
individually
one
to
be
retained
by
the
soldier
signing
and
one
to
be
retained
by
us
several
hundred
refused
to
sign
their
paroles
preferring
to
be
sent
to
the
north
as
prisoners
to
being
sent
back
to
fight
again
others
again
kept
out
of
the
way
hoping
to
escape
either
alternative
pemberton
appealed
to
me
in
person
to
compel
these
men
to
sign
their
paroles
but
i
declined
it
also
leaked
out
that
many
of
the
men
who
had
signed
their
paroles
intended
to
desert
and
go
to
their
homes
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
our
lines
pemberton
hearing
this
again
appealed
to
me
to
assist
him
he
wanted
arms
for
a
battalion
to
act
as
guards
in
keeping
his
men
together
while
being
marched
to
a
camp
of
instruction
where
he
expected
to
keep
them
until
exchanged
this
request
was
also
declined
it
was
precisely
what
i
expected
and
hoped
that
they
would
do
i
told
him
however
that
i
would
see
that
they
marched
beyond
our
lines
in
good
order
by
the
eleventh
just
one
week
after
the
surrender
the
paroles
were
completed
and
the
confederate
garrison
marched
out
many
deserted
and
fewer
of
them
were
ever
returned
to
the
ranks
to
fight
again
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
surrender
been
unconditional
and
the
prisoners
sent
to
the
james
river
to
be
paroled
as
soon
as
our
troops
took
possession
of
the
city
guards
were
established
along
the
whole
line
of
parapet
from
the
river
above
to
the
river
below
the
prisoners
were
allowed
to
occupy
their
old
camps
behind
the
intrenchments
no
restraint
was
put
upon
them
except
by
their
own
commanders
they
were
rationed
about
as
our
own
men
and
from
our
supplies
the
men
of
the
two
armies
fraternized
as
if
they
had
been
fighting
for
the
same
cause
when
they
passed
out
of
the
works
they
had
so
long
and
so
gallantly
defended
between
lines
of
their
late
antagonists
not
a
cheer
went
up
not
a
remark
was
made
that
would
give
pain
really
i
believe
there
was
a
feeling
of
sadness
just
then
in
the
breasts
of
most
of
the
union
soldiers
at
seeing
the
dejection
of
their
late
antagonists
the
day
before
the
departure
the
following
order
was
issued
paroled
prisoners
will
be
sent
out
of
here
they
will
be
authorized
to
cross
at
the
railroad
bridge
and
move
from
there
to
edward
ferry
and
on
by
way
of
raymond
instruct
the
commands
to
be
orderly
and
quiet
as
these
prisoners
pass
to
make
no
offensive
remarks
and
not
to
harbor
any
who
fall
out
of
ranks
after
they
have
passed
chapter

the

with
its

ordnance

ordnance

and
the
successful

fought
in

to

new

for
the

of
the
cause
of
the

were

the

gained
at

upon
the

day
added
to
their
hopes

the

river
was
entirely
in
the

of

for
the

gave

at

the
army
of

was
driven
out
of
pennsylvania
and
forced
back
to
about
the
same
ground
it
occupied
in
the
army
of
the
tennessee
united
with
the
army
of
the
gulf
dividing
the
confederate
states
completely
the
first
dispatch
i
received
from
the
government
after
the
fall
of
vicksburg
was
in
these
words
i
fear
your
paroling
the
prisoners
at
vicksburg
without
actual
delivery
to
a
proper
agent
as
required
by
the
seventh
article
of
the
cartel
may
be
construed
into
an
absolute
release
and
that
the
men
will
immediately
be
placed
in
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
such
has
been
the
case
elsewhere
if
these
prisoners
have
not
been
allowed
to
depart
you
will
detain
them
until
further
orders
halleck
did
not
know
that
they
had
already
been
delivered
into
the
hands
of
major
watts
confederate
commissioner
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
at
vicksburg
prisoners
were
surrendered
together
with
cannon
about
muskets
and
a
large
amount
of
ammunition
the
of
the
enemy
were
far
superior
to
the
bulk
of
ours
up
to
this
time
our
troops
at
the
west
had
been
limited
to
the
old
united
states
muskets
changed
into
percussion
or
the
belgian
musket
imported
early
in
the
war
almost
as
dangerous
to
the
person
firing
it
as
to
the
one
aimed
at
and
a
few
new
and
improved
arms
these
were
of
many
different
calibers
a
fact
that
caused
much
trouble
in
distributing
ammunition
during
an
engagement
the
enemy
had
generally
new
arms
which
had
run
the
blockade
and
were
of
uniform
caliber
after
the
surrender
i
authorized
all
colonels
whose
regiments
were
armed
with
inferior
muskets
to
place
them
in
the
stack
of
captured
arms
and
replace
them
with
the
latter
a
large
number
of
arms
turned
in
to
the
ordnance
department
as
captured
were
thus
arms
that
had
really
been
used
by
the
union
army
in
the
capture
of
vicksburg
in
this
narrative
i
have
not
made
the
mention
i
should
like
of
officers
dead
and
alive
whose
services
entitle
them
to
special
mention
neither
have
i
made
that
mention
of
the
navy
which
its
services
deserve
suffice
it
to
say
the
close
of
the
siege
of
vicksburg
found
us
with
an
army
unsurpassed
in
proportion
to
its
numbers
taken
as
a
whole
of
officers
and
men
a
military
education
was
acquired
which
no
other
school
could
have
given
men
who
thought
a
company
was
quite
enough
for
them
to
command
properly
at
the
beginning
would
have
made
good
regimental
or
brigade
commanders
most
of
the
brigade
commanders
were
equal
to
the
command
of
a
division
and
one
ransom
would
have
been
equal
to
the
command
of
a
corps
at
least
logan
and
crocker
ended
the
campaign
fitted
to
command
independent
armies
general
blair
joined
me
at
milliken
bend
a
general
without
having
served
in
a
lower
grade
he
commanded
a
division
in
the
campaign
i
had
known
blair
in
missouri
where
i
had
voted
against
him
in
when
he
ran
for
congress
i
knew
him
as
a
frank
positive
and
generous
man
true
to
his
friends
even
to
a
fault
but
always
a
leader
i
dreaded
his
coming
i
knew
from
experience
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
command
two
generals
desiring
to
be
leaders
than
it
was
to
command
one
army
officered
intelligently
and
with
subordination
it
affords
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
record
now
my
agreeable
disappointment
in
respect
to
his
character
there
was
no
man
braver
than
he
nor
was
there
any
who
obeyed
all
orders
of
his
superior
in
rank
with
more
unquestioning
alacrity
he
was
one
man
as
a
soldier
another
as
a
politician
the
navy
under
porter
was
all
it
could
be
during
the
entire
campaign
without
its
assistance
the
campaign
could
not
have
been
successfully
made
with
twice
the
number
of
men
engaged
it
could
not
have
been
made
at
all
in
the
way
it
was
with
any
number
of
men
without
such
assistance
the
most
perfect
harmony
reigned
between
the
two
arms
of
the
service
there
never
was
a
request
made
that
i
am
aware
of
either
of
the
or
any
of
his
subordinates
that
was
not
promptly
complied
with
the
campaign
of
vicksburg
was
suggested
and
developed
by
circumstances
the
elections
of
had
gone
against
the
prosecution
of
the
war
voluntary
enlistments
had
nearly
ceased
and
the
draft
had
been
resorted
to
this
was
resisted
and
a
defeat
or
backward
movement
would
have
made
its
execution
impossible
a
forward
movement
to
a
decisive
victory
was
necessary
accordingly
i
resolved
to
get
below
vicksburg
unite
with
banks
against
port
hudson
make
new
orleans
a
base
and
with
that
base
and
grand
gulf
as
a
starting
point
move
our
combined
forces
against
vicksburg
upon
reaching
grand
gulf
after
running
its
batteries
and
fighting
a
battle
i
received
a
letter
from
banks
informing
me
that
he
could
not
be
at
port
hudson
under
ten
days
and
then
with
only
fifteen
thousand
men
the
time
was
worth
more
than
the
reinforcements
i
therefore
determined
to
push
into
the
interior
of
the
enemy
country
with
a
large
river
behind
us
held
above
and
below
by
the
enemy
rapid
movements
were
essential
to
success
jackson
was
captured
the
day
after
a
new
commander
had
arrived
and
only
a
few
days
before
large
reinforcements
were
expected
a
rapid
movement
west
was
made
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
was
met
in
two
engagements
and
badly
defeated
and
driven
back
into
its
stronghold
and
there
successfully
besieged
it
looks
now
as
though
providence
had
directed
the
course
of
the
campaign
while
the
army
of
the
tennessee
executed
the
decree
upon
the
surrender
of
the
garrison
of
vicksburg
there
were
three
things
that
required
immediate
attention
the
first
was
to
send
a
force
to
drive
the
enemy
from
our
rear
and
out
of
the
state
the
second
was
to
send
reinforcements
to
banks
near
port
hudson
if
necessary
to
complete
the
triumph
of
opening
the
mississippi
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
to
the
free
navigation
of
vessels
bearing
the
stars
and
stripes
the
third
was
to
inform
the
authorities
at
washington
and
the
north
of
the
good
news
to
relieve
their
long
suspense
and
strengthen
their
confidence
in
the
ultimate
success
of
the
cause
they
had
so
much
at
heart
soon
after
negotiations
were
opened
with
general
pemberton
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
i
notified
sherman
whose
troops
extended
from
haines
bluff
on
the
left
to
the
crossing
of
the
vicksburg
and
jackson
road
over
the
big
black
on
the
right
and
directed
him
to
hold
his
command
in
readiness
to
advance
and
drive
the
enemy
from
the
state
as
soon
as
vicksburg
surrendered
steele
and
ord
were
directed
to
be
in
readiness
to
join
sherman
in
his
move
against
general
johnston
and
sherman
was
advised
of
this
also
sherman
moved
promptly
crossing
the
big
black
at
three
different
points
with
as
many
columns
all
concentrating
at
bolton
twenty
miles
west
of
jackson
johnston
heard
of
the
surrender
of
vicksburg
almost
as
soon
as
it
occurred
and
immediately
fell
back
on
jackson
on
the
of
july
sherman
was
within
ten
miles
of
jackson
and
on
the
was
close
up
to
the
defences
of
the
city
and
shelling
the
town
the
siege
was
kept
up
until
the
morning
of
the
when
it
was
found
that
the
enemy
had
evacuated
during
the
night
the
weather
was
very
hot
the
roads
dusty
and
the
water
bad
johnston
destroyed
the
roads
as
he
passed
and
had
so
much
the
start
that
pursuit
was
useless
but
sherman
sent
one
division
steele
to
brandon
fourteen
miles
east
of
jackson
the
national
loss
in
the
second
capture
of
jackson
was
less
than
one
thousand
men
killed
wounded
and
missing
the
confederate
loss
was
probably
less
except
in
captured
more
than
this
number
fell
into
our
hands
as
prisoners
medicines
and
food
were
left
for
the
confederate
wounded
and
sick
who
had
to
be
left
behind
a
large
amount
of
rations
was
issued
to
the
families
that
remained
in
jackson
medicine
and
food
were
also
sent
to
raymond
for
the
destitute
families
as
well
as
the
sick
and
wounded
as
i
thought
it
only
fair
that
we
should
return
to
these
people
some
of
the
articles
we
had
taken
while
marching
through
the
country
i
wrote
to
sherman
impress
upon
the
men
the
importance
of
going
through
the
state
in
an
orderly
manner
abstaining
from
taking
anything
not
absolutely
necessary
for
their
subsistence
while
travelling
they
should
try
to
create
as
favorable
an
impression
as
possible
upon
the
people
provisions
and
forage
when
called
for
by
them
were
issued
to
all
the
people
from
bruinsburg
to
jackson
and
back
to
vicksburg
whose
resources
had
been
taken
for
the
supply
of
our
army
very
large
quantities
of
groceries
and
provisions
were
so
issued
sherman
was
ordered
back
to
vicksburg
and
his
troops
took
much
the
same
position
they
had
occupied
before
from
the
big
black
to
haines
bluff
having
cleaned
up
about
vicksburg
and
captured
or
routed
all
regular
confederate
forces
for
more
than
a
hundred
miles
in
all
directions
i
felt
that
the
troops
that
had
done
so
much
should
be
allowed
to
do
more
before
the
enemy
could
recover
from
the
blow
he
had
received
and
while
important
points
might
be
captured
without
bloodshed
i
suggested
to
the
the
idea
of
a
campaign
against
mobile
starting
from
lake
pontchartrain
halleck
preferred
another
course
the
possession
of
the
by
the
union
forces
seemed
to
possess
more
importance
in
his
mind
than
almost
any
campaign
east
of
the
mississippi
i
am
well
aware
that
the
president
was
very
anxious
to
have
a
foothold
in
texas
to
stop
the
clamor
of
some
of
the
foreign
governments
which
seemed
to
be
seeking
a
pretext
to
interfere
in
the
war
at
least
so
far
as
to
recognize
belligerent
rights
to
the
confederate
states
this
however
could
have
been
easily
done
without
wasting
troops
in
western
louisiana
and
eastern
texas
by
sending
a
garrison
at
once
to
brownsville
on
the
rio
grande
halleck
disapproved
of
my
proposition
to
go
against
mobile
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
settle
down
and
see
myself
put
again
on
the
defensive
as
i
had
been
a
year
before
in
west
tennessee
it
would
have
been
an
easy
thing
to
capture
mobile
at
the
time
i
proposed
to
go
there
having
that
as
a
base
of
operations
troops
could
have
been
thrown
into
the
interior
to
operate
against
general
bragg
army
this
would
necessarily
have
compelled
bragg
to
detach
in
order
to
meet
this
fire
in
his
rear
if
he
had
not
done
this
the
troops
from
mobile
could
have
inflicted
inestimable
damage
upon
much
of
the
country
from
which
his
army
and
lee
were
yet
receiving
their
supplies
i
was
so
much
impressed
with
this
idea
that
i
renewed
my
request
later
in
july
and
again
about
the
of
august
and
proposed
sending
all
the
troops
necessary
asking
only
the
assistance
of
the
navy
to
protect
the
debarkation
of
troops
at
or
near
mobile
i
also
asked
for
a
leave
of
absence
to
visit
new
orleans
particularly
if
my
suggestion
to
move
against
mobile
should
be
approved
both
requests
were
refused
so
far
as
my
experience
with
general
halleck
went
it
was
very
much
easier
for
him
to
refuse
a
favor
than
to
grant
one
but
i
did
not
regard
this
as
a
favor
it
was
simply
in
line
of
duty
though
out
of
my
department
the
having
decided
against
me
the
depletion
of
an
army
which
had
won
a
succession
of
great
victories
commenced
as
had
been
the
case
the
year
before
after
the
fall
of
corinth
when
the
army
was
sent
where
it
would
do
the
least
good
by
orders
i
sent
to
banks
a
force
of
men
returned
the
corps
to
kentucky
and
when
transportation
had
been
collected
started
a
division
of
men
to
schofield
in
missouri
where
price
was
raiding
the
state
i
also
detached
a
brigade
under
ransom
to
natchez
to
garrison
that
place
permanently
this
latter
move
was
quite
fortunate
as
to
the
time
when
ransom
arrived
there
the
enemy
happened
to
have
a
large
number
about
head
of
beef
cattle
there
on
the
way
from
texas
to
feed
the
eastern
armies
and
also
a
large
amount
of
munitions
of
war
which
had
probably
come
through
texas
from
the
rio
grande
and
which
were
on
the
way
to
lee
and
other
armies
in
the
east
the
troops
that
were
left
with
me
around
vicksburg
were
very
busily
and
unpleasantly
employed
in
making
expeditions
against
guerilla
bands
and
small
detachments
of
cavalry
which
infested
the
interior
and
in
destroying
mills
bridges
and
rolling
stock
on
the
railroads
the
guerillas
and
cavalry
were
not
there
to
fight
but
to
annoy
and
therefore
disappeared
on
the
first
approach
of
our
troops
the
country
back
of
vicksburg
was
filled
with
deserters
from
army
and
it
was
reported
many
from
johnston
also
the
men
determined
not
to
fight
again
while
the
war
lasted
those
who
lived
beyond
the
reach
of
the
confederate
army
wanted
to
get
to
their
homes
those
who
did
not
wanted
to
get
north
where
they
could
work
for
their
support
till
the
war
was
over
besides
all
this
there
was
quite
a
peace
feeling
for
the
time
being
among
the
citizens
of
that
part
of
mississippi
but
this
feeling
soon
subsided
it
is
not
probable
that
pemberton
got
off
with
over
of
his
army
to
the
camp
where
he
proposed
taking
them
and
these
were
in
a
demoralized
condition
on
the
of
august
i
further
depleted
my
army
by
sending
the
corps
general
ord
commanding
to
banks
besides
this
i
received
orders
to
with
the
latter
general
in
movements
west
of
the
mississippi
having
received
this
order
i
went
to
new
orleans
to
confer
with
banks
about
the
proposed
movement
all
these
movements
came
to
naught
during
this
visit
i
reviewed
banks
army
a
short
distance
above
carrollton
the
horse
i
rode
was
vicious
and
but
little
used
and
on
my
return
to
new
orleans
ran
away
and
shying
at
a
locomotive
in
the
street
fell
probably
on
me
i
was
rendered
insensible
and
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
found
myself
in
a
hotel
near
by
with
several
doctors
attending
me
my
leg
was
swollen
from
the
knee
to
the
thigh
and
the
swelling
almost
to
the
point
of
bursting
extended
along
the
body
up
to
the
the
pain
was
almost
beyond
endurance
i
lay
at
the
hotel
something
over
a
week
without
being
able
to
turn
myself
in
bed
i
had
a
steamer
stop
at
the
nearest
point
possible
and
was
carried
to
it
on
a
litter
i
was
then
taken
to
vicksburg
where
i
remained
unable
to
move
for
some
time
afterwards
while
i
was
absent
general
sherman
declined
to
assume
command
because
he
said
it
would
confuse
the
records
but
he
let
all
the
orders
be
made
in
my
name
and
was
glad
to
render
any
assistance
he
could
no
orders
were
issued
by
my
staff
certainly
no
important
orders
except
upon
consultation
with
and
approval
of
sherman
on
the
of
september
while
i
was
still
in
new
orleans
halleck
telegraphed
to
me
to
send
all
available
forces
to
memphis
and
thence
to
tuscumbia
to
with
rosecrans
for
the
relief
of
chattanooga
on
the
he
telegraphed
again
for
all
available
forces
to
go
to
rosecrans
this
was
received
on
the
i
was
still
confined
to
my
bed
unable
to
rise
from
it
without
assistance
but
i
at
once
ordered
sherman
to
send
one
division
to
memphis
as
fast
as
transports
could
be
provided
the
division
of
mcpherson
corps
which
had
got
off
and
was
on
the
way
to
join
steele
in
arkansas
was
recalled
and
sent
likewise
to
report
to
hurlbut
at
memphis
hurlbut
was
directed
to
forward
these
two
divisions
with
two
others
from
his
own
corps
at
once
and
also
to
send
any
other
troops
that
might
be
returning
there
halleck
suggested
that
some
good
man
like
sherman
or
mcpherson
should
be
sent
to
memphis
to
take
charge
of
the
troops
going
east
on
this
i
sent
sherman
as
being
i
thought
the
most
suitable
person
for
an
independent
command
and
besides
he
was
entitled
to
it
if
it
had
to
be
given
to
any
one
he
was
directed
to
take
with
him
another
division
of
his
corps
this
left
one
back
but
having
one
of
mcpherson
divisions
he
had
still
the
equivalent
before
the
receipt
by
me
of
these
orders
the
battle
of
chickamauga
had
been
fought
and
rosecrans
forced
back
into
chattanooga
the
administration
as
well
as
the
was
nearly
frantic
at
the
situation
of
affairs
there
charles
dana
an
officer
of
the
war
department
was
sent
to
rosecrans
headquarters
i
do
not
know
what
his
instructions
were
but
he
was
still
in
chattanooga
when
i
arrived
there
at
a
later
period
it
seems
that
halleck
suggested
that
i
should
go
to
nashville
as
soon
as
able
to
move
and
take
general
direction
of
the
troops
moving
from
the
west
i
received
the
following
dispatch
dated
october
it
is
the
wish
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
as
soon
as
general
grant
is
able
he
will
come
to
cairo
and
report
by
telegraph
i
was
still
very
lame
but
started
without
delay
arriving
at
columbus
on
the
i
reported
by
telegraph
your
dispatch
from
cairo
of
the
directing
me
to
report
from
cairo
was
received
at
on
the
left
the
same
day
with
staff
and
headquarters
