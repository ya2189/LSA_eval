the
name
of
handel
suggests
to
most
people
the
sound
of
music
unsurpassed
in
massiveness
and
dignity
and
the
familiar
portraits
of
the
composer
present
us
with
a
man
whose
external
appearance
was
no
less
massive
and
dignified
than
his
music
countless
anecdotes
point
him
out
to
us
as
a
figure
in
the
life
of
london
during
the
reigns
of
queen
anne
and
the
first
two
georges
he
lies
buried
in
westminster
abbey
one
would
expect
every
detail
of
his
life
to
be
known
and
recorded
his
every
private
thought
to
be
revealed
with
the
pellucid
clarity
of
his
immortal
strains
it
is
not
so
to
assemble
the
bare
facts
of
handel
life
is
a
problem
which
has
baffled
the
most
laborious
of
his
biographers
and
his
inward
personality
is
more
mysterious
than
that
of
any
other
great
musician
of
the
last
two
centuries
the
of
the
life
of
the
late
george
frederic
written
by
the
rev
john
mainwaring
in
a
year
after
his
death
is
the
first
example
of
a
whole
book
devoted
to
the
biography
of
a
musician
the
author
had
never
known
handel
himself
he
obtained
his
material
chiefly
from
handel
secretary
john
christopher
smith
the
younger
mainwaring
is
our
only
authority
for
the
story
of
handel
early
life
many
of
his
statements
have
been
proved
to
be
untrue
but
there
is
undoubtedly
a
foundation
of
truth
beneath
most
of
them
however
misleading
either
smith
memory
or
mainwaring
imagination
may
have
been
the
rest
of
our
knowledge
has
to
be
built
up
from
scattered
documents
of
various
kinds
helped
out
by
the
reminiscences
of
burney
and
sir
john
hawkins
for
the
inner
life
of
mozart
and
beethoven
we
can
turn
to
copious
letters
and
other
personal
writings
handel
extant
letters
do
not
amount
to
more
than
about
twenty
in
all
and
it
is
only
rarely
that
they
throw
much
light
on
the
workings
of
his
mind
the
family
of
handel
belonged
originally
to
breslau
the
name
is
found
in
various
forms
it
seems
originally
to
have
been
signifying
trader
but
by
the
time
the
composer
was
born
the
spelling
had
been
adopted
this
is
the
correct
german
form
of
his
name
in
italy
he
wrote
his
name
in
order
to
ensure
its
proper
pronunciation
and
in
england
he
was
known
for
the
same
reason
as
handel
the
handels
of
breslau
had
for
several
generations
been
coppersmiths
valentine
handel
the
composer
grandfather
born
in
migrated
to
halle
where
two
of
his
sons
followed
the
same
trade
his
third
son
george
born
became
a
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
married
the
widow
of
the
barber
to
whom
he
had
been
apprenticed
she
was
twelve
years
older
than
he
was
in
she
died
and
george
handel
although
sixty
years
of
age
married
a
second
wife
within
half
a
year
her
name
was
dorothea
taust
her
father
like
most
of
his
ancestors
was
a
clergyman
her
age
was
her
first
child
born
in
died
at
birth
her
second
born
february
was
baptised
the
following
day
with
the
name
of
george
frederic
the
town
of
halle
had
originally
belonged
to
the
dukes
of
saxony
but
after
the
thirty
years
war
it
was
assigned
to
the
elector
of
brandenburg
george
frederic
handel
was
therefore
born
a
prussian
but
duke
augustus
of
saxony
was
allowed
to
keep
his
court
at
the
moritzburg
in
halle
and
it
was
this
prince
who
made
george
handel
his
personal
surgeon
after
duke
death
in
halle
was
definitely
transferred
to
brandenburg
and
the
new
duke
johann
adolf
took
up
his
residence
at
weissenfels
miles
to
the
of
halle
at
the
time
of
george
frederic
birth
halle
had
relapsed
into
being
a
quiet
provincial
town
the
musical
life
of
germany
in
those
days
was
chiefly
centred
in
the
numerous
small
courts
each
of
which
did
its
best
to
imitate
the
magnificence
of
louis
xiv
at
paris
and
versailles
but
the
seventeenth
century
although
it
produced
very
few
musicians
of
outstanding
greatness
was
a
century
of
restless
musical
activity
throughout
europe
especially
in
the
more
private
and
domestic
branches
of
the
art
the
reformation
had
made
music
the
vehicle
of
personal
devotion
and
the
enormous
output
of
a
peculiarly
intimate
type
of
sacred
music
both
in
germany
and
in
england
shows
that
there
must
have
been
a
keen
demand
for
it
in
protestant
home
life
george
handel
the
surgeon
seems
to
have
hated
music
there
is
no
evidence
that
either
his
wife
or
her
sister
who
shared
their
home
after
her
father
death
in
was
musically
gifted
but
the
mere
fact
of
their
being
the
daughters
of
a
lutheran
pastor
makes
it
probable
that
they
had
had
some
education
in
the
art
we
may
safely
guess
that
the
composer
inherited
his
musical
talents
from
the
taust
family
he
showed
his
inclination
for
music
at
a
very
early
age
with
such
insistence
indeed
that
his
father
forbade
him
to
touch
any
musical
instrument
there
is
a
story
of
his
contriving
to
smuggle
a
clavichord
into
a
garret
without
his
father
knowledge
in
order
to
practise
on
it
while
the
rest
of
the
family
were
asleep
but
for
this
tale
mainwaring
is
our
only
authority
it
is
very
probable
that
old
handel
was
irritated
by
the
sound
of
his
early
efforts
and
regarded
music
as
a
waste
of
time
his
wife
may
perhaps
have
encouraged
the
child
obvious
abilities
taking
care
that
he
made
music
only
in
some
part
of
the
house
where
he
would
not
disturb
his
father
at
the
age
of
seven
he
was
sent
to
the
lutheran
grammar
school
and
he
may
very
likely
have
had
some
instruction
in
singing
while
there
in
any
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
taught
more
than
the
mere
rudiments
of
music
in
childhood
however
severe
his
father
opposition
may
have
been
he
was
between
seven
and
nine
when
his
father
took
him
to
weissenfels
where
he
was
required
to
attend
on
the
duke
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
child
may
have
been
taken
there
several
times
especially
as
a
relative
of
his
was
in
regular
service
in
the
duke
establishment
one
day
he
was
allowed
to
play
on
the
organ
in
the
palace
chapel
the
duke
happened
to
hear
him
made
enquiries
as
to
who
the
player
was
and
at
once
urged
on
the
father
the
duty
of
having
him
properly
trained
for
a
musical
career
old
handel
remained
obstinate
he
was
determined
that
his
son
should
have
a
liberal
education
and
become
a
lawyer
by
his
own
efforts
he
had
raised
himself
to
a
position
of
some
distinction
and
affluence
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
wish
his
son
to
enter
on
life
with
better
advantages
than
he
himself
had
enjoyed
he
at
any
rate
followed
the
advice
of
the
duke
so
far
as
to
place
the
boy
under
the
musical
tuition
of
friedrich
zachow
the
organist
of
the
lutheran
church
at
halle
the
next
episode
in
george
frederic
career
has
considerably
puzzled
his
biographers
mainwaring
asserts
that
in
he
went
to
berlin
where
he
was
presented
to
the
electress
sophia
charlotte
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
ariosti
and
giovanni
battista
buononcini
two
famous
italian
opera
composers
whom
he
was
to
encounter
again
in
london
many
years
later
but
it
is
known
that
ariosti
did
not
arrive
in
berlin
until
the
spring
of
and
buononcini
not
until
and
as
old
handel
died
in
february
his
son
can
not
have
been
in
berlin
later
than
about
the
end
of
if
it
is
true
as
mainwaring
says
that
the
elector
offered
to
send
him
to
italy
an
offer
which
the
father
firmly
refused
to
accept
for
him
if
on
the
other
hand
mainwaring
is
right
in
saying
that
young
handel
went
to
berlin
with
a
view
to
obtaining
a
musical
post
there
it
is
hardly
likely
that
he
should
have
made
the
journey
at
ten
years
of
age
and
while
his
father
was
still
living
it
seems
much
more
probable
that
if
he
ever
did
visit
berlin
it
was
when
he
was
of
an
age
to
form
his
own
judgments
as
to
his
future
career
three
days
before
his
seventeenth
birthday
he
matriculated
as
a
law
student
of
the
university
of
halle
but
music
must
have
been
the
chief
occupation
of
his
time
the
composer
telemann
four
years
his
senior
spoke
of
him
as
being
already
a
musician
of
importance
at
halle
when
he
first
met
him
there
probably
in
in
march
he
was
appointed
organist
at
the
cathedral
although
he
belonged
to
the
lutheran
church
whereas
the
cathedral
was
calvinist
considerable
scandal
had
been
caused
by
the
intemperance
of
the
cathedral
organist
one
leporin
who
was
finally
dismissed
that
handel
should
have
been
given
the
post
at
so
early
an
age
points
to
his
ability
and
trustworthiness
of
character
it
also
suggests
that
efficient
organists
were
rare
among
the
calvinist
musicians
mainwaring
unjustly
credited
zachow
with
leporin
love
of
a
cheerful
glass
and
other
biographers
have
perhaps
for
this
reason
greatly
underrated
zachow
musicianship
zachow
can
not
indeed
be
classed
as
a
great
composer
but
he
was
considerably
more
than
merely
a
sound
average
teacher
for
one
thing
he
possessed
a
large
library
of
music
handel
was
not
only
made
to
master
the
arts
of
counterpoint
and
fugue
but
he
was
also
set
to
study
the
works
of
other
composers
and
to
train
his
sense
of
style
by
writing
music
in
direct
imitation
of
them
in
those
days
there
was
no
possibility
of
buying
all
sorts
of
music
ready
printed
printing
was
expensive
and
generally
clumsy
in
execution
as
well
most
music
was
copied
by
hand
and
a
musician
who
wished
to
acquire
a
library
of
music
generally
did
so
by
borrowing
it
and
copying
it
zachow
employed
handel
to
copy
music
for
him
and
no
doubt
he
copied
a
great
deal
for
himself
although
the
opportunities
for
hearing
music
would
not
be
very
liberal
in
a
town
like
halle
handel
under
zachow
became
a
musician
as
well
as
an
accomplished
one
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
chief
contribution
of
germany
to
the
art
of
music
was
religious
just
as
the
german
hymns
were
her
chief
contribution
to
poetry
in
italy
on
the
other
hand
sacred
music
was
of
minor
importance
as
compared
with
the
development
of
opera
but
in
all
music
italy
led
the
way
and
german
sacred
music
was
constantly
influenced
by
the
italians
with
the
result
that
italian
dramatic
methods
were
often
used
by
german
composers
of
sacred
music
not
with
any
loss
of
seriousness
and
dignity
to
its
character
but
rather
to
the
intenser
expression
of
that
deep
personal
religious
feeling
which
characterised
both
the
poetry
and
the
music
of
the
protestant
nations
zachow
was
well
acquainted
with
the
italian
masters
and
his
own
church
music
shows
a
vivid
dramatic
sense
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
handel
learned
from
him
but
although
church
cantatas
and
organ
music
may
have
sufficed
for
the
majority
of
the
innumerable
worthy
german
musicians
of
those
days
the
form
of
music
which
excited
the
curiosity
and
interest
of
the
livelier
spirits
was
certainly
opera
by
opera
had
established
itself
all
over
italy
supported
mainly
by
the
great
princes
but
at
venice
maintained
on
a
commercial
basis
by
the
citizens
themselves
since
the
first
attempt
at
a
german
opera
was
made
by
heinrich
schütz
at
torgau
ten
years
earlier
vienna
introduced
italian
opera
in
and
generally
speaking
the
catholic
princes
of
germany
who
one
after
another
followed
the
example
of
vienna
preferred
opera
in
italian
protestant
germany
inclined
more
to
opera
in
its
own
language
though
towards
the
end
of
the
century
italian
gradually
gained
the
upper
hand
at
the
more
important
courts
native
german
opera
owed
its
origin
partly
to
the
visit
of
the
english
comedians
early
in
the
century
and
partly
to
the
musical
plays
acted
by
from
the
english
jigs
came
the
use
of
short
popular
songs
and
from
the
school
plays
the
tendency
of
the
early
german
operas
to
be
of
a
more
or
less
sacred
or
edifying
character
handel
friend
the
composer
telemann
tells
us
that
it
was
not
unusual
for
students
from
the
university
of
leipzig
to
go
to
berlin
to
hear
the
italian
opera
which
had
been
established
by
the
electress
sophia
charlotte
in
and
this
suggests
that
handel
visit
to
berlin
may
have
taken
place
in
rather
than
in
his
childhood
but
he
certainly
had
opportunities
for
seeing
operas
nearer
home
there
had
been
many
german
operas
performed
at
halle
itself
during
the
twenty
years
before
birth
and
duke
johann
adolf
opened
an
at
weissenfels
in
in
which
philipp
krieger
produced
german
operas
regularly
for
the
next
thirty
years
there
was
thus
every
reason
for
young
handel
growing
ambitious
to
become
a
composer
for
the
stage
although
we
have
no
evidence
of
his
having
ever
attempted
dramatic
composition
until
he
left
halle
in
the
most
important
of
all
the
north
german
was
that
of
hamburg
where
the
opera
did
not
depend
on
the
patronage
of
a
court
but
was
organised
as
at
venice
as
a
public
entertainment
hamburg
had
attempted
german
opera
as
early
as
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
english
composer
william
brade
was
one
of
those
who
provided
the
music
but
the
real
history
of
the
hamburg
opera
may
be
said
to
begin
with
the
performance
of
theile
and
in
the
newly
built
theatre
in
the
in
when
handel
arrived
in
hamburg
in
the
summer
of
the
biblical
operas
had
long
come
to
an
end
and
the
theatre
was
under
the
management
of
reinhold
keiser
keiser
was
a
musician
of
remarkable
genius
his
father
was
a
disreputable
organist
and
his
mother
a
young
lady
of
noble
family
who
had
been
hastily
married
at
the
age
of
sixteen
born
near
weissenfels
in
he
had
begun
his
operatic
career
at
brunswick
at
the
age
of
eighteen
three
years
later
he
took
over
the
direction
of
the
opera
at
hamburg
where
he
produced
a
large
number
of
operas
composed
by
himself
as
a
composer
keiser
had
a
singular
fluency
of
melody
in
a
style
that
hovers
between
those
of
germany
and
italy
had
he
been
a
man
of
more
solid
character
he
might
have
accomplished
greater
things
but
he
had
inherited
from
his
parents
a
love
of
pleasure
and
debauchery
extravagant
in
his
private
life
he
was
no
less
extravagant
in
his
theatrical
management
and
was
ready
to
provide
his
audiences
with
anything
in
the
way
of
startling
sensation
one
of
his
most
famous
operas
was
on
the
subject
of
störtebeker
a
notorious
highwayman
in
which
murders
were
represented
with
the
most
disgusting
realism
hamburg
was
the
venice
of
the
north
and
like
venice
a
city
of
pleasure
but
its
pleasures
were
often
of
a
coarse
and
licentious
description
life
in
hamburg
was
probably
not
much
unlike
that
of
restoration
london
but
though
keiser
may
well
be
set
beside
purcell
hamburg
had
no
dramatists
to
compare
with
congreve
hardly
even
with
shadwell
jeremy
collier
however
was
far
outdone
in
vituperation
by
the
puritan
clergy
who
not
altogether
without
reason
castigated
the
immorality
of
the
hamburg
stage
handel
seems
to
have
arrived
in
hamburg
in
early
summer
of
for
we
first
hear
of
him
there
on
july
when
he
met
johann
mattheson
in
the
church
of
mary
magdalen
it
seems
to
have
been
a
chance
acquaintance
to
judge
from
mattheson
account
it
stuck
in
mattheson
memory
for
many
years
and
he
remembered
especially
the
boy
who
blew
the
organ
for
handel
and
himself
mattheson
was
four
years
older
than
handel
he
was
one
of
those
precociously
gifted
versatile
attractive
and
rather
vain
young
men
who
are
endowed
with
so
many
talents
that
they
never
achieve
distinction
in
any
branch
of
art
he
is
remembered
now
only
by
the
literary
work
of
his
later
life
in
which
he
shows
himself
as
a
voluminous
pedant
and
an
embittered
critic
he
made
friends
with
handel
on
the
spot
and
took
him
under
his
own
protection
providing
him
with
almost
daily
free
meals
at
his
father
house
he
evidently
regarded
him
as
a
very
simple
and
provincial
young
musician
a
notable
organist
indeed
and
a
master
of
such
learned
devices
as
counterpoint
and
fugue
but
a
dull
composer
turning
out
endless
arias
and
cantatas
with
no
sense
of
the
fashionable
italian
taste
it
was
mattheson
by
his
own
account
who
introduced
handel
to
the
musical
life
of
hamburg
the
opera
was
closed
for
the
summer
and
celebrated
winter
concerts
at
which
the
wealthy
society
of
hamburg
listened
to
the
most
famous
singers
and
regaled
themselves
with
tokay
had
not
yet
begun
but
there
was
no
lack
of
social
distractions
in
which
music
no
doubt
played
its
part
in
august
the
two
friends
made
a
journey
to
lubeck
to
compete
for
the
post
of
organist
at
the
marienkirche
in
succession
to
dietrich
buxtehude
who
was
nearly
seventy
and
ready
to
retire
but
both
buxtehude
and
the
town
council
insisted
that
the
new
organist
should
marry
his
predecessor
daughter
in
order
to
save
the
town
the
necessity
of
providing
for
her
she
was
considerably
older
than
the
two
youthful
candidates
and
they
both
withdrew
in
haste
late
in
life
mattheson
married
the
daughter
of
an
english
clergyman
handel
remained
a
bachelor
to
the
end
of
his
days
it
was
no
doubt
through
mattheson
that
handel
in
the
autumn
entered
the
opera
band
as
a
humble
second
violinist
he
seems
to
have
been
of
a
very
retiring
and
quiet
disposition
although
of
a
dry
humour
opera
management
at
hamburg
was
no
less
precarious
than
it
was
in
london
keiser
could
not
afford
the
italian
singers
patronised
by
the
german
princes
and
his
performances
had
often
to
be
helped
out
by
amateurs
of
all
classes
on
one
occasion
the
failed
him
handel
took
his
place
at
short
notice
and
his
musicianship
was
at
once
recognised
unfortunately
mattheson
whose
chronology
is
always
rather
uncertain
does
not
tell
us
when
this
occurred
in
addition
to
his
duties
in
the
orchestra
handel
earned
a
living
by
teaching
private
pupils
and
through
mattheson
he
was
engaged
by
john
wyche
the
english
envoy
as
to
his
small
son
cyril
early
in
mattheson
went
to
holland
where
he
had
some
success
in
organising
concerts
at
amsterdam
and
was
offered
the
post
of
organist
at
haarlem
he
seems
to
have
had
some
idea
of
seeking
his
fortune
in
england
he
spoke
english
well
and
may
have
had
useful
connexions
in
england
through
john
wyche
but
in
march
handel
wrote
to
him
that
the
hamburg
opera
could
not
get
on
without
him
and
to
hamburg
he
returned
it
soon
must
have
become
clear
to
him
that
handel
was
rapidly
outgrowing
any
need
of
his
condescending
patronage
a
according
to
the
words
of
which
had
been
written
by
postel
an
turned
pietist
had
been
set
to
music
by
handel
and
performed
on
good
friday
with
marked
success
mattheson
arrived
too
late
to
hear
it
but
it
is
significant
that
twenty
years
later
he
published
a
scathing
criticism
of
it
although
it
is
a
work
of
little
importance
in
relation
to
handel
complete
career
and
can
seldom
have
been
performed
a
passion
oratorio
by
keiser
was
produced
at
the
same
time
it
may
well
have
been
that
handel
work
youthful
and
conventional
as
it
is
was
enough
to
arouse
the
jealousy
of
both
keiser
and
mattheson
shortly
after
easter
keiser
began
the
composition
of
a
new
opera
on
a
libretto
by
the
local
poet
feustking
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
found
it
necessary
to
call
in
handel
assistance
and
eventually
left
the
whole
work
to
handel
to
compose
it
was
to
be
produced
in
the
autumn
handel
seems
to
have
consulted
mattheson
over
every
detail
of
the
opera
there
exists
a
complete
score
in
mattheson
handwriting
with
corrections
and
additions
by
handel
mattheson
spent
the
summer
enjoying
a
country
holiday
in
mecklenburg
handel
probably
went
on
with
his
opera
at
hamburg
in
october
just
as
the
opera
season
was
reopening
mattheson
contrived
to
get
himself
engaged
by
sir
cyril
wych
as
tutor
to
his
son
he
also
took
over
the
boy
musical
education
hinting
that
handel
was
dismissed
for
neglect
of
his
duties
in
view
of
handel
strictly
honourable
character
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
he
was
guilty
of
neglect
and
we
may
naturally
suppose
him
to
have
resented
the
loss
of
a
lucrative
appointment
the
first
opera
of
the
autumn
was
not
handel
but
an
opera
by
mattheson
called
mattheson
always
eager
to
exhibit
his
versatility
sang
the
part
of
antony
himself
and
not
content
with
that
came
into
the
orchestra
as
soon
as
antony
had
died
on
the
stage
and
kept
himself
in
view
of
the
audience
by
conducting
at
the
harpsichord
for
several
performances
handel
made
no
objection
and
gave
up
his
seat
to
mattheson
when
the
moment
came
but
on
december
for
some
reason
or
other
he
refused
to
the
surprise
and
indignation
of
the
composer
german
musicians
in
those
days
were
a
quarrelsome
crew
at
the
court
of
stuttgart
the
musicians
were
so
much
given
to
knocking
each
other
on
the
head
with
their
instruments
even
in
the
august
presence
of
his
serene
highness
that
there
was
hardly
one
left
undamaged
it
was
only
to
be
expected
that
the
friends
of
handel
and
mattheson
should
egg
them
on
to
fight
a
duel
in
the
street
luckily
mattheson
sword
broke
on
a
button
of
handel
coat
and
the
duel
ended
on
december
a
town
councillor
effected
a
reconciliation
the
rivals
dined
together
at
mattheson
house
and
went
on
to
the
rehearsal
of
which
was
brought
out
on
january
with
mattheson
as
the
principal
tenor
the
libretto
of
which
was
partly
in
german
and
partly
in
italian
ran
continuously
for
about
twenty
performances
until
february
when
it
was
succeeded
by
another
opera
which
handel
had
hastily
composed
for
the
occasion
in
which
mattheson
sang
the
title
part
was
a
failure
the
music
is
lost
but
the
libretto
survives
and
that
is
enough
to
account
for
the
collapse
the
opera
had
three
performances
only
in
the
very
same
season
keiser
to
music
himself
and
brought
it
out
under
the
title
of
shortly
afterwards
he
did
the
same
with
which
was
performed
in
august
of
the
same
year
although
operas
were
no
more
successful
than
handel
and
his
extravagance
and
mismanagement
forced
him
to
leave
hamburg
for
three
years
in
order
to
avoid
imprisonment
it
is
evident
that
he
had
made
handel
position
in
the
theatre
impossible
handel
withdrew
into
private
life
and
devoted
himself
to
earning
a
living
by
teaching
mattheson
says
that
handel
remained
in
hamburg
until
and
that
he
still
worked
in
the
theatre
but
the
first
of
these
statements
is
certainly
untrue
and
the
second
probably
so
mattheson
himself
left
the
theatre
after
the
failure
of
handel
and
his
friendship
with
handel
seems
to
have
come
to
an
end
about
subsequent
life
in
hamburg
we
know
nothing
until
the
theatre
was
taken
over
by
one
saurbrey
in
the
autumn
of
saurbrey
commissioned
an
opera
from
handel
but
owing
to
the
confusion
in
which
keiser
had
left
the
affairs
of
the
theatre
it
could
not
be
brought
out
until
january
when
it
was
found
to
be
so
long
that
it
had
to
be
divided
into
two
operas
and
both
of
which
were
put
on
the
stage
successively
by
that
time
handel
had
left
hamburg
for
italy
he
evidently
took
little
interest
in
the
production
of
these
works
neither
of
which
has
survived
it
was
during
the
run
of
says
mainwaring
that
handel
made
the
acquaintance
of
prince
gian
gastone
de
medici
son
of
the
grand
duke
cosmo
iii
of
tuscany
mainwaring
date
is
wrong
for
it
is
known
that
gian
gastone
at
that
time
was
in
bohemia
with
his
wife
a
german
princess
to
whom
he
had
been
married
against
his
will
but
it
is
also
known
that
he
was
in
hamburg
for
a
few
months
during
the
winter
of
and
if
he
met
handel
at
that
time
the
rest
of
mainwaring
story
becomes
much
more
credible
than
subsequent
biographers
have
been
willing
to
admit
according
to
mainwaring
handel
became
almost
an
intimate
friend
of
the
prince
they
often
discussed
music
together
and
the
prince
lamented
that
handel
was
unacquainted
with
the
music
and
musical
life
of
italy
handel
confessed
that
he
could
see
nothing
in
italian
music
which
answered
the
high
character
his
highness
had
given
it
on
the
contrary
he
thought
it
so
very
indifferent
that
the
singers
he
said
must
be
angels
to
recommend
it
gian
gastone
urged
him
to
come
to
italy
and
hear
for
himself
intimating
that
if
he
chose
to
return
with
him
no
conveniences
should
be
wanting
handel
declined
the
invitation
but
resolved
to
go
to
italy
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
on
his
own
bottom
gian
gastone
was
a
spendthrift
and
a
profligate
his
moral
reputation
was
of
the
worst
and
he
was
chronically
in
debt
that
however
would
not
make
it
unthinkable
that
after
a
glass
of
wine
he
should
invite
handel
to
come
to
italy
with
him
but
handel
may
well
have
known
enough
about
the
prince
even
then
to
reply
to
the
proposal
with
tactful
evasiveness
from
what
mattheson
says
of
handel
on
his
first
arrival
in
hamburg
it
is
quite
likely
that
he
was
contemptuous
of
italian
opera
music
and
it
is
equally
likely
that
after
the
success
of
his
views
on
italian
opera
underwent
a
change
it
is
obvious
that
hamburg
had
no
further
chances
to
offer
him
and
the
attraction
of
italy
was
at
that
time
so
vivid
to
all
young
german
musicians
that
not
one
of
them
would
have
refused
an
opportunity
of
making
the
journey
the
date
of
handel
departure
from
hamburg
is
unknown
nor
have
we
the
slightest
information
as
to
his
whereabouts
until
we
hear
of
him
at
rome
in
january
chrysander
statement
that
he
spent
christmas
with
his
mother
at
halle
is
manifestly
untrue
mattheson
says
that
he
travelled
to
rome
with
a
herr
von
binitz
but
nothing
is
known
of
this
gentleman
his
most
natural
route
into
italy
would
be
by
the
brenner
the
historic
road
of
all
german
pilgrims
handel
may
well
have
been
glad
to
leave
hamburg
but
hamburg
did
not
forget
him
he
is
mentioned
in
a
theatrical
manifesto
of
as
being
already
beloved
and
celebrated
in
italy
barthold
feind
one
of
the
hamburg
librettists
who
in
translated
handel
called
him
the
incomparable
handel
the
orpheus
of
our
time

from
to
almost
all
of

were
represented

cardinal

london
handel
spent
three
years
in
italy
the
known
facts
about
his
life
there
are
singularly
few
and
his
biographers
have
often
had
to
draw
copiously
on
their
imagination
they
may
perhaps
be
forgiven
for
doing
so
since
they
rightly
sought
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
these
three
years
were
the
most
formative
period
of
handel
personality
as
a
composer
handel
came
to
italy
as
a
german
he
left
italy
an
italian
as
far
as
his
music
was
concerned
and
despite
all
other
influences
italian
was
the
foundation
of
his
musical
language
until
the
end
of
his
life
on
january
a
roman
chronicler
noted
the
arrival
of
a
saxon
an
excellent
player
on
the
harpsichord
and
a
composer
of
music
who
has
displayed
his
ability
in
playing
the
organ
in
the
church
of
john
lateran
to
the
amazement
of
everyone
this
can
hardly
refer
to
anyone
else
than
handel
who
throughout
his
sojourn
in
italy
was
always
known
as
the
saxon
we
owe
the
discovery
of
this
important
document
to
newman
flower
the
next
date
known
to
us
is
that
of
april
on
the
manuscript
of
handel
composed
in
rome
most
biographers
have
however
assumed
that
handel
first
halt
in
italy
would
have
been
made
at
florence
in
view
of
the
fact
that
gian
gastone
medici
is
known
to
have
been
at
florence
from
june
to
november
the
eldest
son
of
the
grand
duke
prince
ferdinand
was
an
enthusiastic
patron
of
music
who
employed
the
best
musicians
of
the
day
to
perform
operas
in
his
magnificent
country
palace
at
pratolino
some
twelve
miles
north
of
florence
it
has
been
suggested
that
handel
first
italian
opera
was
composed
for
ferdinand
and
performed
early
in
but
in
view
of
mr
flower
discovery
this
seems
unlikely
mr
flower
suggests
indeed
that
ferdinand
did
not
take
much
interest
in
handel
otherwise
he
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
go
to
rome
so
soon
this
is
not
impossible
for
we
know
that
ferdinand
found
the
operas
of
alessandro
scarlatti
too
serious
for
his
taste
and
he
may
well
have
thought
even
less
of
music
which
as
we
can
see
from
the
score
of
was
still
very
german
in
style
rome
could
offer
handel
no
opportunities
either
for
composing
operas
or
even
for
hearing
them
pope
clement
x
had
permitted
the
opening
of
a
public
the
teatro
tordinona
in
but
it
was
closed
five
years
later
by
innocent
xi
who
made
every
effort
he
could
to
suppress
opera
both
in
public
and
in
private
innocent

who
became
pope
in
seems
to
have
been
at
first
less
intolerant
for
the
theatre
was
rebuilt
and
a
few
performances
were
given
but
in
he
ordered
its
destruction
on
grounds
of
public
morality
except
for
a
few
performances
of
opera
in
private
in
and
no
operas
were
produced
in
rome
until
deprived
of
opera
the
romans
devoted
themselves
to
oratorio
which
in
musical
style
was
much
the
same
thing
and
to
chamber
music
the
most
generous
patron
of
music
in
rome
was
the
young
cardinal
ottoboni
who
had
been
raised
to
the
purple
in
his
early
twenties
in
he
had
indeed
composed
an
opera
himself
which
was
performed
in
but
he
was
more
competent
as
a
poet
than
as
a
musician
in
alessandro
scarlatti
had
set
a
libretto
of
his
handel
was
no
doubt
recommended
to
him
by
ferdinand
de
medici
and
at
the
cardinal
weekly
musical
parties
he
soon
came
into
contact
with
domenico
scarlatti
as
well
as
with
corelli
and
pasquini
alessandro
scarlatti
had
left
naples
probably
for
political
reasons
in
and
at
the
end
of
ottoboni
had
secured
him
a
subordinate
post
at
the
church
of
santa
maria
maggiore
at
the
same
time
appointing
him
his
private
director
of
music
domenico
was
a
young
man
of
handel
own
age
a
young
eagle
as
his
father
called
him
brilliantly
gifted
and
to
judge
from
thomas
roseingrave
impression
of
him
possessed
of
a
singular
personal
fascination
handel
says
mainwaring
used
often
to
speak
of
this
person
with
great
satisfaction
and
indeed
there
was
reason
for
it
for
besides
his
great
talents
as
an
artist
he
had
the
sweetest
temper
and
the
genteelest
behaviour
we
may
indeed
regard
his
friendship
with
handel
as
safely
authenticated
it
is
just
possible
that
handel
may
have
met
alessandro
scarlatti
at
pratolino
in
the
previous
autumn
as
his
opera
gran
was
produced
there
in
september
he
may
well
have
met
him
between
january
and
april
of
from
april
to
september
alessandro
scarlatti
was
in
urbino
handel
movements
now
become
very
difficult
to
follow
it
seems
probable
that
his
opera
was
performed
at
florence
in
the
autumn
of
mainwaring
says
that
it
was
composed
for
ferdinand
de
medici
but
there
is
no
record
of
any
performance
at
pratolino
as
handel
is
said
to
have
been
presented
to
prince
ernest
augustus
of
hanover
at
venice
he
must
have
been
there
in
october
or
november
as
the
prince
is
known
to
have
spent
only
those
two
months
in
that
city
whether
handel
remained
at
venice
over
christmas
or
whether
he
returned
to
rome
is
uncertain
domenico
scarlatti
is
said
to
have
identified
him
at
venice
at
a
masquerade
by
his
playing
of
the
harpsichord
it
would
be
most
natural
to
suppose
then
that
handel
and
the
two
scarlattis
were
in
venice
together
for
the
production
of
alessandro
two
operas
and
trionfo
della
both
of
which
were
brought
out
at
venice
in
but
as
it
is
not
known
whether
this
took
place
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
such
a
conjecture
during
march
and
april
handel
was
the
guest
of
prince
ruspoli
in
rome
this
has
been
definitely
ascertained
by
mr
flower
prince
ruspoli
was
another
great
roman
patron
of
music
and
scarlatti
frequently
composed
works
for
him
his
was
performed
under
his
auspices
on
march
on
easter
sunday
april
handel
made
a
triumphal
appearance
with
which
was
given
on
a
sumptuous
scale
at
expense
in
the
palazzo
bonelli
which
he
was
occupying
at
the
time
corelli
led
the
orchestra
after
handel
seems
to
have
returned
to
the
patronage
of
cardinal
ottoboni
in
whose
palace
he
produced
a
an
allegorical
cantata
called
trionfa
del
tempo
e
del
which
he
remodelled
fifty
years
afterwards
as
triumph
of
time
and
the
libretto
was
by
cardinal
pamphilij
it
was
the
overture
to
this
work
which
caused
so
much
difficulty
to
corelli
handel
irritated
at
his
lack
of
understanding
snatched
the
violin
from
his
hand
and
played
the
passage
himself
to
show
how
it
should
be
executed
corelli
gentlest
of
souls
took
no
offence
although
years
his
senior
and
the
greatest
violinist
living
but
merely
observed
my
dear
saxon
this
music
is
in
the
french
style
of
which
i
have
no
knowledge
it
has
been
assumed
by
many
biographers
that
handel
attended
the
meetings
of
the
arcadian
academy
and
since
prince
ruspoli
was
a
great
benefactor
to
the
academy
this
is
extremely
probable
although
there
is
no
evidence
for
it
handel
was
not
a
member
of
the
academy
and
various
reasons
for
this
have
been
suggested
such
as
that
he
was
a
foreigner
and
also
too
young
to
be
admitted
it
is
more
probable
that
his
admission
to
that
exclusive
society
was
never
even
contemplated
musicians
were
generally
engaged
professionally
for
the
concerts
of
the
italian
academies
but
very
seldom
admitted
to
the
honour
of
membership
corelli
pasquini
and
alessandro
scarlatti
were
all
admitted
together
in
they
were
the
three
senior
and
most
distinguished
composers
of
the
time
and
as
no
other
musicians
were
then
members
it
may
be
assumed
that
these
elections
constituted
an
exceptional
honour
mainwaring
relates
that
cardinal
pamphili
on
one
occasion
wrote
a
poem
in
honour
of
handel
and
desired
him
to
set
it
to
music
himself
in
this
poem
he
was
compared
to
orpheus
and
exalted
above
the
rank
of
mortals
later
biographers
being
unable
to
trace
any
music
of
handel
to
this
poem
assumed
that
handel
was
too
modest
to
sing
his
own
praises
but
he
was
not
for
the
original
manuscript
of
the
cantata
was
found
by
the
present
writer
in
the
university
library
at
münster
in
westphalia
as
mainwaring
informs
us
handel
is
compared
by
the
poet
whose
name
is
not
given
to
orpheus
and
indeed
exalted
above
him
orpheus
says
the
cardinal
could
move
rocks
and
trees
but
he
could
not
make
them
sing
therefore
thou
art
greater
than
orpheus
for
thou
compellest
my
aged
muse
to
song
the
style
of
both
words
and
music
suggests
that
the
whole
cantata
was
thrown
off
as
mainwaring
suggests
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
this
improvisation
may
well
have
taken
place
at
one
of
the
arcadians
garden
parties
for
there
is
a
account
of
a
similar
improvisation
by
the
poet
zappi
and
the
composer
alessandro
scarlatti
handel
was
by
this
time
fully
accepted
as
one
of
the
leading
musicians
in
italy
for
in
june
he
composed
a
pastoral
galatea
e
for
the
marriage
of
the
duke
of
alvito
at
naples
on
july
it
was
in
july
that
the
austrian
viceroy
of
naples
count
daun
was
succeeded
by
cardinal
grimani
who
towards
the
end
of
the
year
persuaded
alessandro
scarlatti
to
return
to
the
service
of
the
royal
chapel
as
a
good
friend
to
scarlatti
the
cardinal
was
sure
to
interest
himself
in
handel
and
it
was
probably
through
him
that
handel
was
commissioned
to
write
an
opera
for
venice
as
the
grimani
were
a
great
venetian
family
and
owned
the
principal
there
how
long
handel
stayed
at
naples
we
do
not
know
all
that
mainwaring
tells
us
is
that
he
was
taken
up
by
a
spanish
princess
but
as
naples
had
belonged
to
spain
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
spanish
princesses
can
have
been
no
rarities
there
and
it
is
impossible
to
identify
this
lady
from
july
until
december
we
lose
sight
of
handel
entirely
on
december
the
first
night
of
the
carnival
season
his
opera
was
produced
at
venice
the
libretto
was
by
cardinal
grimani
who
had
already
written
other
dramas
for
music
all
produced
like
handel
at
the
teatro
san
giovanni
crisostomo
in
venice
venice
was
the
first
city
which
had
undertaken
opera
on
a
commercial
basis
open
to
the
public
on
payment
whereas
in
other
places
it
depended
for
many
years
on
the
munificence
of
princes
and
nobles
at
venice
there
existed
not
one
theatre
but
several
devoted
to
opera
each
called
after
the
name
of
the
parish
in
which
it
was
situated
and
of
these
the
theatre
of
john
chrysostom
built
by
the
grimani
family
and
still
standing
though
much
remodelled
under
the
name
of
teatro
malibran
was
the
largest
and
most
important
the
inquisition
took
a
more
tolerant
view
of
opera
than
the
pope
a
venetian
preacher
admonished
actors
and
singers
to
remember
that
they
were
abominated
of
god
but
tolerated
by
the
government
by
desire
of
those
who
took
delight
in
their
iniquities
aroused
an
extraordinary
enthusiasm
the
theatre
at
almost
every
pause
resounded
with
shouts
and
acclamations
of
il
taro
sassone
and
other
expressions
of
approbation
too
extravagant
to
be
mentioned
mainwaring
the
title
part
was
sung
by
margherita
durastanti
and
another
singer
who
appeared
in
the
opera
was
boschi
the
famous
bass
both
of
them
were
to
sing
for
handel
in
london
later
on
it
is
fairly
certain
that
boschi
must
have
sung
the
part
of
polyphemus
in
italian
e
at
naples
for
it
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
other
songs
written
for
boschi
whose
voice
was
of
exceptional
range
the
opera
ran
for
nights
after
this
unprecedented
triumph
it
seems
surprising
that
handel
did
not
remain
in
italy
where
he
had
so
many
friends
who
could
ensure
his
success
it
is
probable
that
by
the
time
was
performed
if
not
indeed
long
before
he
had
been
promised
the
post
of
kapellmeister
to
the
court
of
hanover
the
actual
appointment
is
dated
june
but
no
sooner
was
handel
appointed
than
he
at
once
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
went
on
first
to
düsseldorf
and
then
to
london
it
was
probably
the
intention
that
he
should
spend
some
time
in
foreign
travel
before
taking
up
regular
duty
the
three
years
which
handel
spent
in
italy
at
the
most
impressionable
period
of
his
life
fixed
the
characteristics
of
his
style
as
a
composer
and
we
may
well
suppose
that
they
exercised
a
decisive
influence
on
his
personality
and
character
his
youth
had
been
spent
in
the
respectable
environment
of
his
home
at
halle
then
came
the
three
years
at
hamburg
fantastic
and
exciting
yet
despite
all
the
artistic
stimulus
of
keiser
inevitably
sordid
and
provincial
italy
introduced
him
to
an
entirely
different
atmosphere
to
a
life
of
dignity
and
serenity
in
which
a
classical
culture
both
literary
and
artistic
was
the
matured
fruit
of
wealth
leisure
and
good
breeding
that
exquisite
life
found
its
highest
musical
expression
in
alessandro
scarlatti
who
at
that
period
was
incontestably
the
greatest
of
living
musicians
on
his
style
handel
formed
his
own
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
of
all
scarlatti
operas
the
one
which
most
strikingly
foreshadows
the
genius
of
handel
is
which
handel
may
possibly
have
seen
at
venice
in
the
winter
of
the
musical
library
of
handel
english
friend
charles
jennens
contained
a
large
collection
of
scarlatti
manuscripts
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
was
handel
who
brought
them
with
him
from
italy
in
venice
handel
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
prince
ernest
of
hanover
younger
brother
of
the
elector
georg
ludwig
who
was
eventually
to
become
king
of
england
as
george
i
with
prince
ernest
was
baron
kielmansegge
who
for
many
years
afterwards
remained
a
firm
supporter
of
handel
and
another
venetian
acquaintance
was
the
duke
of
manchester
english
ambassador
to
the
republic
of
venice
through
prince
ernest
and
kielmansegge
handel
was
recommended
to
the
court
of
hanover
the
duke
of
manchester
gave
him
a
pressing
invitation
to
england
music
in
hanover
was
under
the
direction
of
an
italian
agostino
steffani
who
was
not
only
a
musician
but
priest
and
diplomatist
as
well
born
at
castelfranco
in
he
was
taken
as
a
boy
to
munich
where
he
studied
music
and
in
entered
the
priesthood
he
produced
several
operas
there
and
about
became
kapellmeister
to
the
court
of
hanover
here
he
was
employed
on
important
diplomatic
business
pope
innocent
xi
made
him
titular
bishop
of
spiga
in
the
west
indies
and
in
he
was
ambassador
at
brussels
in
he
became
the
representative
for
north
germany
and
it
was
doubtless
owing
to
his
heavy
ecclesiastical
duties
that
he
resigned
his
musical
post
in
favour
of
handel
although
hanover
remained
his
chief
place
of
residence
until
his
death
in
he
was
in
rome
in
and
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
he
made
handel
acquaintance
there
but
this
hardly
seems
consistent
with
handel
own
statement
recorded
by
hawkins
in
his
of
when
i
first
arrived
at
hanover
i
was
a
young
man
under
twenty
i
was
acquainted
with
the
merits
of
steffani
and
he
had
heard
of
me
i
understood
somewhat
of
music
and
could
play
pretty
well
on
the
organ
he
received
me
with
great
kindness
and
took
an
early
opportunity
to
introduce
me
to
the
princess
sophia
and
the
elector
son
giving
them
to
understand
that
i
was
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
a
virtuoso
in
music
he
obliged
me
with
instructions
for
my
conduct
and
behaviour
during
my
residence
at
hanover
and
being
called
from
the
city
to
attend
to
matters
of
a
public
concern
he
left
me
in
possession
of
that
favour
and
patronage
which
himself
had
enjoyed
for
a
series
of
years
these
statements
of
handel
seem
in
fact
to
point
to
his
having
visited
hanover
before
he
went
to
italy
possibly
before
he
went
to
hamburg
or
more
probably
during
the
course
of
his
hamburg
period
in
which
case
one
might
conclude
that
the
electress
sophia
had
defrayed
the
cost
of
handel
italian
journey
even
if
handel
made
a
mistake
as
to
his
age
he
clearly
implies
that
his
first
meeting
with
steffani
took
place
in
hanover
at
düsseldorf
handel
was
sure
of
a
warm
welcome
for
the
elector
johann
wilhelm
was
a
close
friend
of
steffani
and
his
wife
was
a
sister
of
ferdinand
and
gian
gastone
de
medici
he
was
a
man
of
extravagant
tastes
and
his
was
maintained
on
the
most
magnificent
scale
but
handel
did
not
stay
there
long
england
was
a
greater
attraction
and
he
arrived
in
london
for
the
first
time
in
the
autumn
of
nothing
is
known
of
handel
early
days
in
london
but
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
he
was
provided
with
letters
of
introduction
to
persons
of
influence
we
meet
him
first
in
the
company
of
heidegger
a
swiss
adventurer
who
achieved
notoriety
through
his
incredible
ugliness
and
from
onwards
was
concerned
in
the
management
of
the
opera
at
the
theatre
in
the
haymarket
through
heidegger
handel
was
introduced
to
mary
granville
then
a
little
girl
of
ten
whom
he
delighted
by
his
performance
on
her
own
spinet
her
uncle
sir
john
stanley
asked
her
if
she
thought
she
should
ever
play
as
well
as
handel
if
i
did
not
think
i
should
she
cried
i
would
burn
my
instrument
mary
granville
who
seven
years
later
married
a
pendarves
and
in
became
the
wife
of
delany
was
for
many
years
one
of
handel
most
faithful
friends
and
supporters
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
the
musical
life
of
london
was
developing
in
a
new
fashion
as
compared
with
what
it
was
in
the
last
twenty
years
of
the
previous
century
the
type
of
english
opera
which
purcell
and
dryden
had
created
came
to
an
end
with
purcell
death
in
italian
music
especially
when
sung
by
italian
singers
was
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
popular
with
london
and
in
thomas
clayton
produced
at
drury
lane
an
opera
called
queen
of
clayton
had
visited
italy
and
had
brought
back
with
him
a
collection
of
italian
songs
he
got
peter
motteux
to
translate
for
him
an
old
italian
opera
libretto
and
adapted
these
songs
to
it
how
much
of
was
clayton
own
work
is
not
known
burney
speaks
of
the
opera
with
nothing
but
contempt
yet
it
seems
to
have
had
some
fair
success
and
was
even
revived
the
following
year
but
clayton
to
a
libretto
by
addison
did
not
survive
three
performances
it
was
followed
by
a
series
of
italian
operas
composed
by
buononcini
scarlatti
and
others
at
first
the
operas
were
in
english
and
sung
by
english
singers
but
gradually
italian
was
introduced
as
at
hamburg
and
in
an
opera
called
the
music
of
which
burney
ascribes
conjecturally
to
buononcini
was
given
in
italian
with
an
entirely
italian
company
the
victory
of
the
italians
was
due
mainly
to
the
marvellous
singing
and
acting
of
nicola
grimaldi
known
as
nicolini
who
first
appeared
in
london
in
scarlatti
and
nicolini
was
not
the
first
who
had
been
heard
in
england
the
famous
siface
had
been
brought
over
by
queen
mary
of
modena
in
but
nicolini
was
the
first
who
appeared
on
the
english
stage
and
it
was
he
who
paved
the
way
for
senesino
farinelli
and
the
rest
and
established
that
annual
season
of
italian
opera
which
is
not
yet
extinct
at
the
time
when
handel
arrived
in
london
the
opera
company
had
migrated
from
drury
lane
to
vanbrugh
new
theatre
in
the
haymarket
where
it
was
under
the
management
of
aaron
hill
an
enterprising
young
man
of
own
age
who
was
ready
to
pursue
any
sort
of
career
that
chance
might
offer
him
whether
in
literature
music
or
business
adventure
we
may
safely
hazard
a
guess
that
it
was
boschi
who
persuaded
hill
to
invite
handel
to
compose
an
opera
for
the
queen
theatre
as
boschi
had
already
sung
in
november
in
an
opera
by
francesco
mancini
in
which
nicolini
delighted
his
audience
in
a
fight
with
a
lion
hill
sketched
a
plot
based
on
tasso
and
an
italian
libretto
was
hastily
provided
by
giacomo
rossi
handel
composing
the
music
at
the
same
time
and
often
overtaking
the
poet
the
music
in
fact
was
completed
in
a
fortnight
and
the
opera
of
was
first
produced
on
the
stage
on
february
to
judge
from
burney
account
of
the
preceding
weeks
of
the
season
coupled
with
this
astonishingly
rapid
collaboration
it
is
probable
that
hill
was
in
a
difficult
situation
from
which
only
a
new
and
strikingly
successful
opera
could
save
him
achieved
the
desired
success
it
did
more
it
established
handel
reputation
in
england
as
a
dramatic
composer
and
set
london
a
new
standard
in
italian
opera
the
previous
italian
operas
had
been
works
of
little
distinction
and
some
of
them
had
even
been
operas
as
they
were
called
put
together
from
songs
by
various
composers
even
scarlatti
and
paled
beside
the
new
opera
of
handel
for
it
had
been
written
as
far
back
as
and
was
in
a
style
which
scarlatti
himself
had
long
abandoned
had
fifteen
performances
in
the
course
of
the
season
it
provoked
bitter
attacks
from
addison
in
the
and
from
steele
in
the
but
everybody
knew
that
addison
vanity
was
wounded
by
the
grotesque
failure
of
and
that
steele
had
interests
in
the
playhouse
it
was
useless
at
that
particular
moment
to
champion
the
cause
of
english
opera
for
england
happened
to
possess
not
a
single
composer
who
was
equal
to
the
task
of
writing
one
the
opera
season
came
to
an
end
in
june
and
handel
left
london
for
germany
he
did
not
go
straight
back
to
hanover
but
stayed
at
düsseldorf
again
where
the
elector
was
evidently
desirous
of
keeping
him
as
long
as
possible
for
the
elector
himself
wrote
more
than
once
to
hanover
to
make
excuses
for
handel
prolonged
absence
from
his
official
duties
handel
may
well
have
felt
that
hanover
was
a
dull
place
as
compared
with
london
there
was
no
opera
and
his
chief
function
was
to
compose
italian
chamber
duets
for
the
princess
caroline
of
ansbach
afterwards
queen
of
england
but
he
may
well
have
taken
pleasure
in
her
service
for
she
was
an
excellent
musician
and
no
mean
singer
in
november
handel
paid
a
visit
to
halle
in
order
to
stand
godfather
to
his
niece
johanna
friderica
michaelsen
the
daughter
of
his
surviving
sister
who
eventually
inherited
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
some
biographers
have
stated
that
handel
had
already
revisited
his
birthplace
in
before
going
to
london
mainwaring
is
their
authority
for
this
but
mainwaring
habitually
confused
dates
and
more
probably
referred
to
the
visit
of
for
which
we
have
the
certain
evidence
of
friderica
michaelsen
baptismal
register
it
is
clear
that
the
alleged
visit
of
was
suggested
merely
by
a
desire
to
make
the
most
of
affection
for
his
mother
which
mainwaring
had
already
emphasised
mainwaring
however
went
beyond
the
truth
in
saying
that
she
had
become
blind
she
did
eventually
lose
her
sight
but
not
until
some
twenty
years
later
handel
appears
to
have
remained
at
hanover
until
the
autumn
of
when
he
obtained
permission
to
go
to
london
again
on
condition
that
he
engaged
to
return
within
a
reasonable
time
mainwaring
what
period
was
to
be
considered
reasonable
we
do
not
know
handel
had
certainly
been
planning
this
london
visit
for
some
time
as
he
was
corresponding
with
friends
in
england
and
was
also
taking
some
trouble
to
improve
his
knowledge
of
the
english
language
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
hankered
after
london
for
london
offered
him
a
society
which
bore
more
resemblance
to
the
world
which
he
had
known
at
rome
the
tradition
of
italian
culture
had
for
generations
been
more
firmly
implanted
in
england
than
anywhere
in
germany
except
perhaps
in
vienna
and
since
those
three
years
in
italy
handel
musical
outlook
had
become
completely
italian
as
his
music
shows
the
few
attempts
which
he
made
at
german
church
music
present
a
curious
contrast
of
style
one
could
hardly
believe
them
to
be
the
work
of
that
handel
whom
we
have
adopted
as
our
own
german
music
at
that
date
was
provincial
italian
music
was
the
music
of
the
great
world
because
it
was
the
music
of
the
theatre
it
was
to
the
theatre
that
handel
looked
forward
and
london
had
what
even
rome
had
not
an
opera
and
an
italian
opera
the
success
of
had
shown
him
that
london
was
the
place
where
he
might
launch
out
into
a
triumphal

the
handelian
type
of
opera
was
the
laughingstock
of
musical
critics
they
wondered
how
any
audiences
could
have
endured
to
sit
through
it
and
why
the
fashionable
society
of
london
should
have
neglected
native
music
for
what
johnson
defined
as
an
exotic
and
irrational
entertainment
the
modern
reader
impression
of
an
italian
opera
of
handel
days
is
a
story
about
some
ancient
or
mediaeval
hero
whose
very
name
is
often
to
most
people
unknown
if
he
happens
to
be
someone
as
famous
as
julius
caesar
the
familiar
episodes
of
his
life
are
sacrificed
to
some
imaginary
and
complicated
intrigue
presented
in
the
form
of
long
and
elaborate
songs
thinly
accompanied
and
separated
by
stretches
of
dreary
recitative
but
in
those
days
persons
of
culture
in
england
as
well
as
in
italy
were
perhaps
more
interested
in
ancient
history
and
in
the
history
of
the
later
roman
empire
than
they
are
now
it
is
significant
that
gibbon
and
made
its
appearance
just
when
the
fashion
for
operas
on
subjects
which
might
have
been
taken
from
its
pages
was
coming
to
an
end
the
conventional
treatment
of
those
subjects
which
makes
all
the
operas
seem
exactly
alike
was
the
result
of
a
certain
literary
reform
which
had
tended
to
standardise
opera
libretti
under
the
influence
of
racine
and
it
was
really
a
movement
towards
dignity
and
dramatic
unity
after
the
monstrous
confusion
of
the
earlier
venetian
operas
as
to
the
conventionality
of
the
music
and
its
forms
of
air
and
recitative
it
can
only
be
said
that
all
serious
italian
music
was
written
in
these
forms
it
was
simply
the
normal
musical
style
of
the
period
and
must
have
been
as
natural
to
its
own
audiences
as
the
style
of
puccini
or
richard
strauss
at
the
present
day
handelian
opera
has
often
been
described
as
a
concert
in
costume
and
burney
writing
as
late
as
both
admits
this
description
and
defends
it
an
opera
at
the
worst
is
still
better
than
a
concert
merely
for
the
ear
or
a
pantomime
entertainment
for
the
eye
supposing
the
articulation
to
be
wholly
unintelligible
we
have
an
excellent
union
of
melody
and
harmony
vocal
as
well
as
instrumental
for
the
ear
and
according
to
sir
richard
steele
account
of
nicolini
action
was
so
significant
that
a
deaf
man
might
go
along
with
him
in
the
sense
of
the
part
he
acted
no
one
will
dispute
but
that
understanding
italian
would
render
our
entertainment
at
an
opera
more
rational
and
more
complete
but
without
that
advantage
let
it
be
remembered
by
the
lovers
of
music
that
an
opera
is
the
to
which
they
can
go
with
this
advantage
over
those
in
still
life
that
to
the
most
perfect
singing
and
effects
of
a
powerful
and
band
are
frequently
added
excellent
acting
splendid
scenes
and
decorations
with
such
dancing
as
a
playhouse
from
its
inferior
prices
is
seldom
able
to
furnish
orchestral
concerts
in
those
days
did
not
exist
concerts
of
any
kind
were
rare
and
the
best
were
to
be
heard
in
that
historic
room
over
thomas
britton
small
coal
shop
in
clerkenwell
where
handel
himself
sometimes
played
on
a
for
the
genuine
musical
enthusiasts
of
london
society
it
was
no
wonder
that
italian
opera
became
fashionable
italian
singers
have
always
been
unrivalled
in
popular
favour
and
in
handel
days
they
were
not
only
something
new
to
england
but
were
the
exponents
of
a
vocal
art
which
admittedly
has
never
been
surpassed
the
theatre
was
new
and
sumptuous
society
was
wealthy
and
at
the
same
time
exclusive
at
the
opera
the
great
world
met
together
as
in
a
sort
of
club
people
went
to
talk
and
to
be
seen
as
well
as
to
see
and
hear
they
do
so
in
certain
still
and
the
queen
theatre
in
the
haymarket
possessed
the
greatest
living
a
greater
even
than
scarlatti
himself
it
was
a
period
when
there
was
still
a
considerable
tradition
of
musicianship
among
the
amateurs
of
english
society
old
countess
granville
known
to
her
younger
relatives
as
the
dragon
who
had
lived
all
through
the
age
of
locke
and
purcell
wrote
at
the
age
of
eighty
to
her
cousin
pendarves
handel
child
friend
mary
granville
in
there
is
i
think
no
accomplishment
so
great
for
a
lady
as
music
for
it
tunes
the
mind
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
the
great
houses
capable
of
appreciating
the
merits
of
handel
or
at
any
rate
of
constituting
themselves
his
enemies
handel
must
have
arrived
in
england
at
least
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
october
for
the
manuscript
of
pastor
the
first
new
opera
which
he
produced
is
dated
at
the
end
londres
ce
octobre
the
was
now
under
the
management
of
owen
macswiney
who
seems
to
have
been
both
incompetent
and
unreliable
pastor
did
not
attract
the
public
and
was
withdrawn
after
six
performances
but
handel
soon
had
another
opera
ready
to
take
its
place
was
finished
on
december
and
brought
out
on
january
it
was
a
opera
closely
modelled
on
with
an
abundance
of
scenic
effects
after
the
second
performance
macswiney
disappeared
leaving
the
singers
unpaid
as
well
as
the
and
the
company
carried
on
the
season
undeterred
and
the
management
was
taken
over
by
heidegger
opera
was
performed
twelve
times
on
the
last
night
for
the
benefit
between
the
acts
he
gave
a
performance
himself
on
the
harpsichord
for
the
moment
however
the
operatic
situation
was
not
encouraging
and
handel
turned
his
thoughts
in
other
directions
he
had
stayed
first
at
the
london
house
of
a
andrews
of
barn
elms
in
surrey
but
he
soon
transferred
himself
to
the
house
of
lord
burlington
in
piccadilly
lord
burlington
was
only
seventeen
years
of
age
but
he
and
his
mother
made
burlington
house
an
artistic
and
literary
centre
comparable
with
the
palaces
of
cardinal
ottoboni
and
prince
ruspoli
at
rome
as
the
libretto
of
is
dedicated
to
him
he
must
have
taken
handel
under
his
patronage
soon
after
his
arrival
in
england
but
the
precise
date
at
which
handel
went
to
live
with
him
is
uncertain
according
to
hawkins
he
stayed
at
burlington
house
for
three
years
meeting
pope
gay
and
arbuthnot
as
well
as
many
other
men
of
the
first
eminence
for
genius
but
gay
does
not
seem
to
have
met
lord
burlington
until
and
pope
mentions
him
first
in
it
is
thought
that
handel
little
opera
may
have
been
written
for
a
private
performance
at
burlington
house
in
and
the
dedication
of
handel
next
opera
indicates
that
the
music
was
composed
within
his
patron
own
walls
one
of
handel
favourite
haunts
in
london
was
paul
cathedral
where
brind
the
organist
often
persuaded
him
to
play
the
organ
after
evening
service
to
the
great
delight
of
the
congregation
he
appears
to
have
made
brind
acquaintance
first
through
young
maurice
greene
then
aged
seventeen
who
had
been
a
chorister
of
paul
and
after
his
voice
broke
in
was
articled
to
brind
as
a
pupil
after
service
was
over
handel
greene
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
choir
would
repair
to
the
queen
arms
tavern
close
by
for
an
evening
of
music
and
musical
conversation
this
friendly
association
with
paul
was
no
doubt
of
great
value
to
handel
in
his
next
musical
undertakings
the
for
queen
anne
and
the
which
celebrated
the
peace
of
utrecht
in
the
queen
patronage
may
very
likely
have
been
obtained
for
him
by
lady
burlington
as
she
was
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
these
two
works
are
important
landmarks
in
handel
career
as
they
were
his
first
compositions
to
english
words
and
his
first
compositions
for
english
ceremonial
occasions
they
marked
him
out
as
the
natural
successor
to
purcell
and
it
is
evident
that
in
each
case
he
took
purcell
similar
composition
as
his
model
up
till
now
he
had
been
a
foreigner
engaged
to
provide
italian
opera
for
the
amusement
of
fashionable
society
with
the
he
became
a
court
musician
to
the
queen
of
england
and
with
the
his
music
entered
paul
the
practical
result
of
the
was
a
pension
of
a
year
conferred
on
him
by
queen
anne
it
is
clear
that
he
now
regarded
england
as
his
permanent
home
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
officially
the
servant
of
the
elector
of
hanover
and
had
undertaken
to
return
thither
within
a
reasonable
time
but
on
august
the
queen
died
and
the
elector
was
proclaimed
king
of
england
when
george
i
came
over
to
his
new
country
handel
did
not
dare
to
show
himself
at
court
and
all
efforts
on
the
part
of
his
friends
to
effect
a
reconciliation
with
the
king
were
in
vain
the
king
went
to
see
his
new
opera
which
came
out
late
in
the
season
of
but
refused
to
pardon
him
until
handel
old
venetian
acquaintance
baron
kielmansegge
now
master
of
the
horse
devised
an
ingenious
expedient
for
surprising
the
king
into
clemency
one
of
the
favourite
amusements
of
london
society
was
to
make
up
a
on
the
thames
with
a
band
of
musicians
in
attendance
pendarves
describes
a
party
of
this
kind
in
july
they
rowed
up
to
richmond
where
they
had
supper
and
were
entertained
all
the
time
by
very
good
music
for
wind
instruments
in
another
barge
baron
kielmansegge
arranged
that
the
king
should
go
for
an
excursion
of
this
kind
and
that
without
his
knowledge
handel
should
conduct
appropriate
music
of
his
own
in
a
barge
that
followed
the
king
as
the
baron
was
often
in
charge
of
the
music
for
such
occasions
this
can
have
been
a
matter
of
no
great
difficulty
in
any
case
it
achieved
the
desired
result
the
king
was
enchanted
with
the
music
and
restored
handel
to
favour
as
mainwaring
tells
this
story
just
before
speaking
of
it
has
generally
been
assumed
that
this
episode
took
place
in
the
summer
of
but
more
recently
it
has
been
ascribed
to
on
the
strength
of
a
long
account
of
a
royal
with
music
by
handel
given
in
the
a
newspaper
of
the
period
this
account
was
copied
by
the
envoy
of
brandenburg
at
the
court
of
james
and
despatched
by
him
to
berlin
the
discovery
of
this
document
has
led
certain
writers
to
cast
doubt
on
mainwaring
story
streatfeild
is
probably
right
in
suggesting
that
mainwaring
story
refers
to
an
earlier
and
that
handel
contributed
music
frequently
for
such
occasions
he
also
points
out
that
the
celebrated
was
not
published
until
and
that
it
may
quite
well
have
been
collected
from
various
aquatic
programmes
hawkins
relates
the
story
of
the
evidently
copying
from
mainwaring
but
hawkins
had
known
handel
personally
and
had
been
supplied
by
him
with
certain
reminiscences
one
of
which
was
unknown
to
mainwaring
according
to
this
anecdote
recorded
by
hawkins
the
reconciliation
with
george
i
was
due
to
the
violinist
geminiani
who
had
composed
a
set
of
sonatas
dedicated
to
baron
kielmansegge
geminiani
was
a
notoriously
difficult
player
to
accompany
and
insisted
on
handel
and
no
other
taking
the
harpsichord
when
he
went
to
play
the
sonatas
to
the
king
mr
flower
in
his
life
of
handel
refuses
all
credit
to
tale
and
takes
the
view
that
the
king
never
had
any
quarrel
with
handel
at
all
in
any
case
it
seems
certain
that
he
confirmed
the
pension
granted
to
him
by
queen
anne
and
added
a
further
a
year
of
his
own
a
few
years
later
handel
received
yet
another
a
year
from
caroline
of
ansbach
now
princess
of
wales
for
teaching
her
daughters
the
harpsichord
so
that
he
enjoyed
a
settled
income
of
a
year
for
the
rest
of
his
life
produced
may
did
not
have
many
performances
as
the
season
ended
on
july
but
it
attracted
considerable
attention
partly
because
that
old
favourite
nicolini
sang
in
it
again
and
also
on
account
of
its
elaborate
staging
there
is
more
enchantment
and
machinery
in
this
opera
says
burney
than
i
have
ever
found
to
be
announced
in
any
other
musical
drama
performed
in
england
during
the
following
season
which
did
not
begin
until
february
both
and
were
revived
but
handel
produced
no
new
opera
the
king
seems
to
have
wished
to
see
nicolini
in
his
older
parts
and
was
revived
as
well
as
other
operas
of
the
days
before
first
arrival
in
england
in
july
at
the
end
of
the
season
george
i
returned
to
hanover
where
he
remained
until
the
end
of
the
year
handel
accompanied
him
but
seems
to
have
had
freedom
to
travel
for
he
visited
hamburg
where
he
avoided
meeting
his
old
friend
mattheson
though
he
corresponded
with
him
from
a
safe
distance
he
also
went
to
halle
where
his
mother
was
still
living
zachow
however
was
dead
and
had
left
his
widow
in
straitened
circumstances
with
an
idle
and
intemperate
son
handel
helped
the
widow
and
continued
to
send
her
money
in
later
years
but
he
eventually
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
useless
to
do
anything
for
the
son
from
halle
he
went
on
to
ansbach
no
doubt
on
some
commission
from
the
princess
of
wales
at
ansbach
he
found
an
old
friend
from
the
university
of
halle
johann
christoph
schmidt
who
was
established
in
a
woollen
business
although
schmidt
was
married
and
had
a
family
he
was
persuaded
by
handel
to
leave
these
behind
at
ansbach
and
to
travel
with
him
to
london
where
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
as
handel
faithful
secretary
and
copyist
his
son
came
over
later
on
and
after
handel
had
provided
for
his
education
assisted
his
father
in
looking
after
handel
during
his
old
age
during
these
six
months
in
germany
handel
reverted
for
a
moment
to
german
music
he
set
what
is
known
as
the
a
sacred
cantata
in
verse
by
the
hamburg
poet
brockes
which
had
already
been
set
once
by
keiser
later
on
it
was
set
to
music
again
by
two
of
handel
former
friends
first
by
telemann
and
then
by
mattheson
little
is
known
about
the
composition
of
this
work
handel
apparently
had
a
copy
made
after
his
return
to
england
and
sent
this
to
mattheson
and
it
was
performed
at
hamburg
in
handel
does
not
seem
to
have
had
it
performed
in
england
he
used
up
the
music
afterwards
for
other
works
chrysander
attributed
to
a
set
of
nine
german
songs
with
violin
to
words
by
brockes
but
there
is
some
difficulty
about
accepting
this
date
for
although
eight
of
the
poems
had
already
been
printed
by
brockes
there
is
one
which
is
found
only
in
the
second
edition
of
the
book
printed
in
the
king
came
back
to
london
in
january
and
it
is
supposed
that
handel
came
with
him
the
opera
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
and
were
once
more
revived
for
nicolini
but
handel
contributed
no
new
work
and
after
the
season
came
to
an
end
in
july
there
was
no
more
italian
opera
in
london
until
it
was
during
this
period
that
handel
became
musical
director
to
the
duke
of
chandos
for
whom
he
composed
works
of
a
character
new
both
to
england
and
to
himself
james
brydges
first
duke
of
chandos
had
built
himself
an
italian
palace
at
canons
near
edgware
in
which
he
must
have
outdone
even
the
magnificent
lord
burlington
in
sumptuousness
and
ostentation
like
a
german
princeling
he
kept
his
choir
and
his
band
of
musicians
though
there
seems
to
be
no
evidence
that
he
was
himself
genuinely
musical
the
chapel
of
the
house
a
florid
italian
baroque
building
with
frescoes
in
the
appropriate
style
by
italian
painters
was
opened
in
and
the
anthem
for
the
occasion
was
no
doubt
one
of
handel
it
is
not
known
what
music
of
handel
was
performed
at
the
duke
private
concerts
but
for
the
services
of
the
chapel
he
composed
the
famous
te
and
the
twelve
here
again
purcell
was
his
model
but
the
style
was
own
a
style
indeed
so
appropriate
to
the
formal
stateliness
of
the
establishment
that
these
works
have
never
become
part
of
the
ordinary
cathedral
repertory
it
was
to
purcell
and
to
some
extent
to
scarlatti
too
that
handel
owed
the
general
plan
of
the
anthems
with
their
orchestral
accompaniments
but
even
purcell
anthems
with
orchestra
had
by
that
time
been
found
too
elaborate
for
general
use
to
the
chandos
period
belongs
also
a
work
which
is
still
one
of
most
popular
compositions
the
english
and
to
words
by
john
gay
it
was
not
a
revision
of
the
which
he
wrote
at
naples
but
an
entirely
new
work
more
important
as
a
landmark
in
handel
development
is
the
masque
of
originally
called
and
about
the
early
history
of
these
works
little
is
known
both
were
intended
to
be
acted
on
the
stage
and
they
were
very
probably
performed
in
this
way
at
canons
the
words
of
were
adapted
from
racine
play
of
the
same
name
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
pope
was
the
author
handel
residence
at
canons
gave
rise
to
two
legends
about
him
which
are
still
so
often
repeated
that
their
absurdity
must
be
mentioned
here
although
they
have
been
known
for
many
years
to
be
baseless
one
is
perpetuated
by
an
inscription
on
the
organ
in
the
church
at
whitchurch
to
the
effect
that
handel
composed
the
oratorio
of
on
this
instrument
handel
was
never
organist
at
whitchurch
the
church
existed
in
his
day
but
it
was
an
entirely
separate
building
from
the
private
chapel
of
the
duke
of
chandos
which
was
pulled
down
with
the
house
the
organ
of
that
chapel
is
now
at
gosport
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
in
any
case
it
was
not
handel
practice
to
compose
his
works
on
an
organ
the
other
and
even
more
popular
legend
is
that
of
the
harmonious
blacksmith
it
was
during
the
canons
period
that
handel
published
his
de
pièces
pour
le
which
had
probably
been
composed
for
the
daughters
of
the
princess
of
wales
and
one
of
these
suites
contains
the
air
and
variations
known
by
that
familiar
title
but
the
air
was
never
called
by
this
name
before
about
that
time
a
young
at
bath
who
had
previously
been
a
blacksmith
apprentice
earned
the
nickname
of
the
harmonious
blacksmith
because
he
was
always
singing
that
particular
tune
somehow
the
name
got
transferred
from
the
singer
to
the
song
and
in
the
story
of
handel
having
been
inspired
to
compose
the
tune
after
hearing
a
blacksmith
at
edgware
produce
musical
notes
from
his
anvil
was
first
put
into
print
in
a
letter
to
not
long
afterwards
an
imaginary
blacksmith
of
edgware
was
invented
and
his
alleged
anvil
sold
by
auction
whether
the
air
is
handel
own
composition
at
all
is
a
matter
of
uncertainty
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
least
unusual
about
any
composer
taking
another
man
air
as
a
theme
for
variations
and
it
has
been
suggested
with
some
plausibility
that
the
tune
is
that
of
an
old
french
song
on
august
handel
sister
dorothea
sophia
died
of
consumption
at
halle
she
was
not
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
the
other
sister
johanna
had
died
in
the
sermon
preached
at
dorothea
funeral
on
august
has
been
preserved
and
tells
us
that
one
of
her
favourite
texts
from
the
bible
which
she
was
often
in
the
habit
of
quoting
was
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
chrysander
suggested
and
we
may
well
believe
that
the
setting
of
these
words
in
given
to
a
female
voice
owed
its
inspiration
to
the
memory
of
dorothea
sophia
handel
was
evidently
much
attached
to
her
to
attend
her
funeral
was
impossible
and
it
was
some
months
before
handel
could
visit
halle
again
but
on
february
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
thanking
him
for
all
the
kindness
which
he
had
shown
to
his
sister
and
promising
to
come
to
halle
as
soon
as
his
engagements
permitted
handel
inability
to
leave
london
before
february
was
due
to
the
fact
that
a
new
scheme
for
the
promotion
of
opera
in
london
was
on
foot
the
first
idea
was
probably
suggested
in
the
circle
of
the
duke
of
chandos
towards
the
end
of
it
was
the
moment
of
the
south
sea
bubble
and
speculation
had
become
the
universal
fashion
to
revive
the
italian
opera
a
company
was
formed
among
members
of
the
nobility
a
capital
of
was
raised
in
shares
of
each
and
the
king
himself
contributed
the
new
venture
was
called
the
royal
academy
of
music
in
imitation
of
the
royale
de
under
which
name
the
paris
opera
was
officially
known
the
french
designation
was
obviously
suggested
by
the
italian
academies
or
literary
and
musical
societies
of
the
period
the
expression
di
is
still
occasionally
used
in
italy
to
signify
a
concert
the
directors
engaged
nicolo
haym
and
paolo
rolli
as
poets
to
provide
libretti
for
the
music
they
naturally
secured
handel
but
also
invited
buononcini
over
from
rome
and
attilio
ariosti
from
berlin
handel
was
sent
at
once
to
dresden
to
select
singers
on
february
he
is
stated
to
have
left
london
for
that
purpose
but
it
is
possible
that
he
may
actually
have
started
later
for
in
his
letter
to
his
dated
february
he
says
i
beg
you
will
not
judge
of
my
desire
to
see
you
by
the
delay
of
my
departure
for
to
my
great
regret
i
find
myself
detained
here
by
important
business
on
which
i
may
say
my
fortune
depends
and
it
has
dragged
on
longer
than
i
expected
i
hope
i
shall
be
at
the
end
of
it
in
a
month
from
now
handel
exact
itinerary
is
difficult
to
establish
we
know
that
he
went
to
düsseldorf
where
he
engaged
the
singer
baldassari
but
whether
this
was
on
the
outward
journey
or
later
in
the
year
is
uncertain
from
the
letter
to
michaelsen
we
should
imagine
that
he
went
to
halle
as
soon
as
possible
the
only
authentic
document
which
gives
us
any
date
is
a
letter
from
count
flemming
a
court
functionary
at
dresden
to
melusine
von
schulenburg
daughter
of
george
i
mistress
the
duchess
of
kendal
who
in
married
lord
chesterfield
melusine
was
a
pupil
of
handel
in
london
the
letter
is
dated
from
dresden
october
the
count
seems
to
have
been
much
offended
by
handel
behaviour
and
suggests
that
he
was
a
little
mad
peu
count
flemming
was
evidently
vain
of
his
own
musicianship
and
this
made
him
feel
all
the
more
hurt
at
handel
obstinate
refusal
to
accept
his
invitations
the
electoral
prince
of
saxony
was
married
about
this
time
to
an
austrian
archduchess
and
the
elector
had
invited
several
of
the
most
famous
italian
singers
headed
by
the
composer
lotti
to
dresden
to
grace
the
occasion
hoping
to
make
contracts
with
them
for
the
winter
season
handel
object
in
dresden
was
to
tempt
these
celebrities
to
london
by
the
offer
of
english
guineas
so
that
he
was
naturally
obliged
to
be
extremely
discreet
in
his
relations
with
the
officials
of
the
court
he
certainly
played
the
harpsichord
at
court
for
in
the
following
february
a
sum
of
ducats
was
paid
to
him
this
however
can
not
indicate
that
he
was
actually
in
dresden
at
that
date
and
may
easily
have
been
a
delayed
payment
for
earlier
services
handel
negotiations
with
the
singers
were
only
moderately
successful
for
he
was
unable
to
secure
anyone
except
signora
durastanti
for
the
opening
of
the
london
opera
even
though
that
was
delayed
until
april
the
others
remained
at
dresden
but
it
is
probable
that
handel
offers
had
not
been
without
their
attractions
for
the
italian
singers
at
dresden
gave
so
much
trouble
to
the
management
that
the
elector
suddenly
dismissed
the
whole
crew
in
february
none
of
them
however
appeared
in
london
before
the
autumn
season
handel
visit
to
halle
this
year
is
of
peculiar
interest
because
of
the
attempt
made
by
bach
to
become
acquainted
with
him
biography
of
bach
is
the
only
authority
for
this
story
bach
in
was
in
the
service
of
the
prince
of
hearing
that
handel
was
in
the
neighbourhood
he
went
over
to
halle
a
distance
of
about
twenty
miles
but
found
that
handel
had
already
departed
for
london
the
exact
date
of
handel
return
is
not
known
but
as
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
shareholders
of
the
opera
on
november
he
may
have
been
in
england
by
that
time
he
was
not
himself
one
of
the
actual
directors
of
the
company
the
only
professional
member
of
the
board
was
heidegger
burney
suggests
that
the
affairs
of
the
company
were
none
too
prosperous
even
before
the
season
began
and
it
is
strange
that
so
long
a
delay
took
place
between
the
first
initiation
of
the
scheme
in
the
winter
of
and
the
first
rise
of
the
curtain
on
april
handel
at
any
rate
must
have
felt
his
own
position
to
be
secure
for
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
took
the
house
at
what
was
then
lower
brook
street
grosvenor
square
where
he
resided
for
the
rest
of
his
life
his
name
appears
first
in
among
the
ratepayers
of
the
parish
of
george
hanover
square
but
not
long
ago
a
lead
cistern
was
found
in
the
house
bearing
his
initials
and
the
date
on
what
terms
he
took
the
house
is
not
known
it
is
not
mentioned
in
his
will
chapter
iv
buononcini

death
of
george
i
beggar
collapse
of
the
academy
the
opening
performance
of
the
royal
academy
of
music
was
undistinguished
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
the
noble
directors
should
have
begun
their
season
with
an
opera
by
porta
a
venetian
composer
who
is
described
in
the
book
of
words
as
servant
to
his
grace
the
duke
of
wharton
the
duke
of
wharton
was
not
one
of
the
directors
the
company
moreover
was
more
english
than
italian
it
included
baldassari
durastanti
and
a
second
woman
called
galerati
together
with
anastasia
robinson
who
afterwards
became
countess
of
peterborough
turner
robinson
wife
of
the
organist
of
westminster
abbey
dennis
and
gordon
ran
for
five
performances
on
april
it
was
succeeded
by
handel
new
opera
in
which
the
same
singers
took
part
except
that
dennis
did
not
appear
and
la
garde
sang
the
part
of
farasmane
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
two
of
the
male
parts
were
taken
by
women
radamisto
durastanti
and
tigrane
galerati
this
looks
as
if
the
management
had
found
it
impossible
to
secure
a
sufficient
number
of
italian
who
probably
demanded
exorbitant
fees
fared
little
better
than
an
enormous
crowd
came
to
the
first
night
and
many
were
turned
away
but
the
opera
was
not
performed
more
than
ten
times
in
the
season
it
was
probably
above
the
heads
of
the
audience
for
it
is
one
of
handel
finest
works
for
the
stage
and
a
great
advance
on
any
of
his
previous
operas
the
only
other
opera
performed
was
by
domenico
scarlatti
which
was
even
less
successful
than
the
others
chrysander
seems
to
suggest
that
scarlatti
came
to
london
with
the
idea
of
being
a
rival
to
handel
but
it
is
much
more
likely
that
handel
himself
persuaded
the
academy
to
invite
the
friend
of
his
youth
the
season
ended
on
june
was
printed
and
was
published
by
handel
himself
at
his
own
house
a
really
serious
rival
to
handel
appeared
in
the
autumn
lord
burlington
had
made
the
acquaintance
in
rome
of
giovanni
buononcini
and
had
heard
his
opera
perhaps
he
had
had
enough
of
handel
after
three
years
of
his
close
company
in
burlington
house
in
any
case
he
probably
thought
himself
a
better
judge
of
music
than
handel
he
secured
buononcini
for
the
academy
and
the
season
opened
on
november
with
the
dedication
to
the
earl
of
burlington
is
signed
by
paolo
rolli
and
no
other
author
name
is
mentioned
but
the
libretto
was
really
by
apostolo
zeno
had
ten
performances
before
christmas
and
twenty
afterwards
was
revived
again
but
buononcini
established
himself
firmly
in
the
favour
of
a
large
party
although
burney
speaks
very
disparagingly
of
the
music
it
is
not
in
the
least
surprising
that
the
opera
attracted
the
public
in
the
first
place
it
had
the
advantage
of
a
magnificent
cast
of
singers
senesino
boschi
berenstadt
berselli
durastanti
salvai
and
galerati
and
this
sudden
blaze
of
vocal
splendour
would
in
itself
have
made
the
success
of
any
opera
especially
of
one
which
opened
the
season
besides
buononcini
music
was
pleasing
and
after
a
far
longer
stage
experience
than
handel
he
naturally
wrote
what
singers
enjoyed
singing
it
must
further
be
added
that
buononcini
himself
was
a
striking
personality
he
had
produced
operas
at
berlin
and
vienna
as
well
as
in
various
italian
cities
and
was
a
man
of
the
world
accustomed
to
the
society
of
courts
besides
buononcini
was
a
stranger
and
a
novelty
handel
was
becoming
an
established
institution
indeed
he
was
well
on
the
way
to
becoming
an
english
composer
the
same
singers
with
the
addition
of
anastasia
robinson
appeared
in
the
season
of
a
curious
experiment
was
tried
in
of
which
the
first
act
was
composed
by
filippo
mattei
the
second
by
buononcini
and
the
third
by
handel
each
act
having
an
overture
and
concluding
chorus
some
biographers
have
supposed
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
trial
of
strength
and
that
the
contest
resulted
in
the
acknowledged
triumph
of
handel
but
burney
is
probably
right
in
saying
that
the
collaboration
was
merely
a
device
to
save
time
in
getting
the
opera
ready
and
burney
further
points
out
that
buononcini
position
remained
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
in
fact
due
to
buononcinci
next
two
operas
and
not
to
handel
that
the
academy
was
able
to
declare
a
dividend
of
seven
per
cent
handel
december
had
a
moderate
success
only
and
against
handel
one
opera
except
for
a
few
performances
of
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
season
buononcini
had
three
works
to
his
credit
the
following
season
brought
handel
better
fortune
and
a
decline
in
the
popularity
of
buononcini
in
november
and
december
and
were
revived
on
january
handel
produced
a
new
opera
with
a
new
singer
francesca
cuzzoni
who
eclipsed
all
the
other
women
singers
completely
until
after
some
years
she
herself
was
driven
into
eclipse
by
her
historic
rival
faustina
bordoni
contains
one
number
at
least
which
is
familiar
to
everyone
who
knows
the
name
of
handel
the
gavotte
at
the
end
of
the
overture
this
spirited
piece
of
music
won
popularity
at
the
outset
and
even
it
is
probably
the
best
known
melody
of
handel
after
the
harmonious
blacksmith
but
the
real
success
of
was
made
by
cuzzoni
how
cuzzoni
came
to
be
engaged
at
the
opera
is
not
clear
handel
can
not
possibly
have
ever
heard
her
sing
it
has
been
suggested
that
she
was
engaged
by
heidegger
she
was
about
and
had
made
her
first
appearance
at
venice
in
after
which
she
sang
in
various
italian
theatres
she
had
a
voice
of
extraordinary
range
beauty
and
agility
she
was
equally
accomplished
both
in
florid
music
and
in
airs
of
a
sustained
and
pathetic
character
and
she
was
never
known
to
sing
out
of
tune
in
appearance
she
was
anything
but
attractive
she
was
short
squat
and
excessively
she
was
uneducated
and
impulsive
and
quarrelsome
her
arrival
in
london
was
delayed
for
some
reason
so
the
management
sent
sandoni
the
second
to
meet
her
probably
at
dover
on
the
way
to
london
they
were
married
sandoni
doubtless
had
an
eye
to
the
money
which
she
was
to
earn
her
first
air
in
falsa
imagine
fixed
her
reputation
as
an
expressive
and
pathetic
singer
burney
she
had
at
first
refused
to
sing
it
on
which
handel
remarked
to
her
madame
je
sais
que
vous
êtes
une
véritable
diablesse
mais
je
vous
ferai
savoir
moi
que
je
suis
béelzebub
le
chef
des
diables
seized
her
round
and
waist
and
threatened
to
throw
her
out
of
the
window
handel
had
similar
trouble
with
gordon
the
english
singer
who
came
in
for
a
small
part
in
which
was
given
on
may
gordon
found
fault
with
handel
method
of
accompanying
and
threatened
to
jump
on
the
harpsichord
oh
replied
handel
let
me
know
when
you
will
do
that
and
i
will
advertise
it
for
i
am
sure
more
people
will
come
to
see
you
jump
than
to
hear
you
sing
two
more
operas
by
buononcini
were
given
but
his
relations
with
the
academy
were
not
very
cordial
he
had
been
taken
up
by
the
marlborough
family
and
was
commissioned
to
compose
the
funeral
anthem
for
the
burial
of
the
great
duke
in
june
on
may
pendarves
informed
her
sister
that
the
young
duchess
had
settled
a
year
for
life
on
buononcini
provided
he
will
compose
any
more
for
the
ungrateful
academy
who
do
not
deserve
he
should
entertain
them
since
they
do
know
how
to
value
his
works
as
they
ought
the
contract
however
seems
not
to
have
been
carried
out
by
the
composer
pendarves
evidently
took
the
news
from
the
day
issue
of
a
weekly
journal
adding
only
the
name
of
the
duchess
which
the
paper
had
suppressed
what
the
paper
tells
us
is
that
the
academy
had
not
engaged
buononcini
for
the
coming
season
senesino
and
cuzzoni
had
made
life
impossible
for
the
other
singers
durastanti
retired
to
the
continent
anastasia
robinson
left
the
stage
and
married
her
old
admirer
lord
peterborough
senesino
and
cuzzoni
however
were
indispensable
to
the
success
of
the
opera
and
probably
the
ridiculous
affectations
of
the
one
and
the
abominable
manners
of
the
other
were
not
without
their
attraction
to
a
public
which
could
enjoy
all
the
pleasure
of
gossiping
about
them
without
having
to
put
up
with
them
at
close
quarters
the
season
of
began
in
november
with
buononcini
and
handel
in
january
a
new
opera
by
attilio
ariosti
was
given
and
ran
for
nine
successive
nights
ariosti
was
never
a
very
troublesome
rival
to
handel
he
was
a
man
of
amiable
character
and
apparently
quite
content
to
remain
aloof
from
the
party
politics
of
the
on
february
handel
produced
his
one
of
his
finest
dramatic
works
it
has
been
revived
with
considerable
success
in
recent
years
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
modern
audiences
are
more
familiar
with
the
episode
of
caesar
and
cleopatra
than
with
the
subjects
of
handel
other
operas
had
the
advantage
of
a
strong
cast
senesino
sang
the
title
part
with
berenstadt
and
boschi
to
support
him
and
the
women
included
cuzzoni
as
well
as
durastanti
and
robinson
who
had
not
yet
quitted
the
opera
company
another
masterpiece
of
handel
inaugurated
the
autumn
season
of
in
october
in
december
appeared
ariosti
in
january
held
the
stage
till
the
production
of
another
handel
opera
which
came
out
on
february
and
ran
for
thirteen
nights
two
more
operas
by
ariosti
and
leonardo
vinci
of
naples
completed
the
season
but
it
was
evidently
handel
who
scored
the
greatest
triumphs
unless
the
honours
should
more
properly
go
to
cuzzoni
as
rodelinda
and
her
brown
silk
gown
trimmed
with
silver
all
the
old
ladies
says
burney
were
scandalised
with
its
vulgarity
and
indecorum
but
the
young
adopted
it
as
a
fashion
so
universally
that
it
seemed
a
national
uniform
for
youth
and
beauty
cuzzoni
created
a
further
sensation
in
the
summer
by
giving
birth
to
a
daughter
pendarves
made
much
fun
of
the
event
it
is
a
mighty
mortification
it
was
not
a
son
sons
and
heirs
ought
to
be
out
of
fashion
when
such
scrubs
shall
pretend
to
be
dissatisfied
at
having
a
daughter
pity
indeed
that
the
noble
name
and
family
of
the
sandonis
should
be
extinct
the
minute
she
was
brought
to
bed
she
sang
la
speranza
a
song
in
revivals
of
and
took
place
in
the
following
season
and
in
march
handel
produced
in
which
the
famous
march
was
heard
for
the
first
time
on
the
rise
of
the
curtain
but
cuzzoni
throne
was
soon
to
be
sharply
contested
ever
since
the
directors
of
the
opera
had
been
trying
to
secure
faustina
bordoni
and
at
last
with
a
promise
of
for
the
season
cuzzoni
received
they
succeeded
faustina
was
born
of
a
patrician
family
at
venice
in
she
had
been
brought
up
under
the
protection
of
alessandro
marcello
brother
of
the
composer
and
had
made
her
debut
at
venice
at
the
age
of
sixteen
she
sang
mostly
at
venice
for
several
years
and
in
she
appeared
there
in
pollaroli
along
with
cuzzoni
herself
she
sang
at
munich
in
and
in
the
summer
of
she
went
to
vienna
where
she
stayed
six
months
enjoying
an
extraordinary
success
nearly
forty
years
afterwards
the
empress
maria
theresa
recalled
with
pride
how
she
herself
at
the
age
of
seven
had
sung
in
an
opera
with
faustina
at
the
end
of
march
she
left
vienna
for
london
where
she
made
her
first
appearance
on
may
in
handel
new
opera
which
had
been
designed
especially
to
show
off
both
faustina
and
cuzzoni
in
parts
of
exactly
equal
importance
and
difficulty
the
immediate
result
was
to
divide
london
society
into
two
parties
young
lady
burlington
and
her
friends
supported
faustina
cuzzoni
admirers
were
led
by
lady
pembroke
lady
walpole
succeeded
in
getting
both
to
sing
at
her
house
neither
would
sing
in
the
presence
of
the
other
but
the
hostess
tactfully
managed
to
draw
first
one
and
then
the
other
out
of
the
while
her
rival
enchanted
the
guests
pendarves
also
contrived
to
be
on
good
terms
with
both
she
heard
cuzzoni
in
november
privately
or
perhaps
at
a
rehearsal
and
writes
my
senses
were
ravished
with
harmony
the
opera
was
expected
to
begin
about
the
middle
of
december
but
i
think
faustina
and
madame
sandoni
cuzzoni
are
not
perfectly
agreed
about
their
parts
the
opening
however
was
delayed
by
the
absence
of
senesino
who
had
gone
to
italy
and
did
not
return
until
fairly
late
in
december
it
was
probably
owing
to
this
fact
that
opera
in
english
was
offered
at
the
theatre
in
lincoln
inn
fields
where
marcantonio
buononcini
first
given
in
london
in
was
revived
by
a
mainly
english
cast
of
singers
pendarves
went
to
see
it
and
her
criticisms
are
significant
for
the
taste
of
the
time
i
ca
say
i
was
much
pleased
with
it
i
liked
it
for
old
acquaintance
sake
but
there
is
not
many
of
the
songs
better
than
ballads
faustina
the
most
agreeable
creature
in
the
world
in
company
dined
with
pendarves
for
a
small
musical
party
on
january
on
the
previous
day
there
was
the
first
rehearsal
of
handel
it
was
the
moment
says
burney
of
handel
greatest
prosperity
and
english
patronage
exhibited
conspicuously
what
burney
called
handel
science
it
was
evidently
considered
to
be
complicated
in
style
though
at
the
same
time
both
pathetic
and
passionate
music
says
burney
was
no
longer
regarded
as
a
mere
soother
of
affliction
or
incitement
to
hilarity
it
could
now
paint
the
passions
in
all
their
various
attitudes
and
those
tones
which
said
nothing
intelligible
to
the
heart
began
to
be
thought
as
insipid
as
those
of
brass
or
tinkling
cymbals
these
words
of
burney
make
one
realise
that
handel
london
operas
must
have
affected
their
audiences
almost
in
the
way
in
which
the
operas
of
wagner
startled
the
audiences
of
the
nineteenth
century
handel
himself
like
wagner
was
steadily
developing
his
own
dramatic
powers
and
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
it
was
only
those
marvellous
singers
of
handel
day
such
as
senesino
cuzzoni
faustina
and
boschi
who
could
inspire
him
to
the
creation
of
such
music
as
they
only
were
competent
to
interpret
was
received
with
respect
and
although
the
partisans
of
the
rival
queens
were
noisy
in
their
applause
no
actual
disturbance
took
place
until
admeto
was
followed
by
buononcini
on
may
on
the
first
night
of
the
new
opera
each
side
did
its
best
to
drown
the
opposite
party
favourite
with
a
chorus
of
catcalls
the
behaviour
of
the
audience
became
more
and
more
disgraceful
as
the
opera
was
repeated
until
on
the
last
night
june
when
the
princess
of
wales
was
present
cuzzoni
and
faustina
delighted
the
sporting
instincts
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
england
by
indulging
in
a
free
fight
on
the
stage
five
days
later
george
i
died
suddenly
at
osnabruck
george
ii
was
crowned
on
october
to
the
music
of
handel
coronation
anthems
the
opera
season
reopened
a
month
later
apparently
the
quarrel
between
cuzzoni
and
faustina
had
been
patched
up
probably
neither
of
them
wanted
to
lose
their
english
contracts
they
appeared
together
in
handel
and
again
in
february
as
well
as
in
april
but
the
battle
seems
to
have
been
won
by
cuzzoni
who
obtained
the
more
important
parts
we
hear
of
no
more
disturbances
the
fact
was
that
the
audiences
were
too
thin
to
be
noisy
pendarves
always
a
devoted
supporter
of
handel
was
pessimistic
from
the
beginning
of
the
season
i
doubt
operas
will
not
survive
longer
than
this
winter
she
wrote
on
november
they
are
now
at
their
last
gasp
the
subscription
is
expired
and
nobody
will
renew
it
the
directors
are
always
squabbling
and
they
have
so
many
divisions
among
themselves
that
i
wonder
they
have
not
broke
up
before
senesino
goes
away
next
winter
and
i
believe
faustina
so
you
see
harmony
is
almost
out
of
fashion
was
revived
on
june
this
was
faustina
last
appearance
and
the
last
night
of
the
royal
academy
of
music
the
opera
was
announced
for
june
but
faustina
declared
herself
indisposed
the
opera
was
shut
up
and
the
company
disbanded
faustina
went
with
senesino
to
paris
and
thence
to
venice
where
cuzzoni
also
made
her
appearance
and
continued
in
the
local
dialect
the
campaign
of
slander
against
faustina
alleged
immoralities
there
were
many
reasons
for
the
collapse
of
the
opera
it
had
been
carried
on
with
reckless
extravagance
and
the
noble
directors
were
in
all
probability
not
very
expert
men
of
business
the
scandalous
behaviour
of
all
concerned
in
may
well
have
caused
a
in
the
subscriptions
pendarves
who
was
a
lady
of
unimpeachable
conduct
continued
to
go
to
the
opera
but
she
was
a
serious
lover
of
music
and
a
personal
friend
of
handel
the
failure
of
the
academy
is
generally
attributed
to
the
success
of
beggar
which
had
been
brought
out
at
lincoln
inn
fields
on
january
and
at
once
took
london
by
storm
a
letter
of
pendarves
dated
january
but
evidently
continued
later
tells
us
that
she
went
to
a
rehearsal
of
i
like
it
extremely
but
the
taste
of
the
town
is
so
depraved
that
nothing
will
be
approved
of
but
the
burlesque
the
entirely
triumphs
over
the
italian
one
even
pendarves
could
not
help
enjoying
it
once
she
had
seen
it
it
is
probable
that
handel
himself
had
contributed
to
the
downfall
of
the
academy
out
of
the
performances
given
between
and
works
obtained
buononcini
and
ariosti
the
great
singers
had
drawn
the
public
to
listen
to
handel
operas
but
it
is
clear
from
many
contemporary
allusions
that
handel
music
was
too
severe
to
be
an
attraction
in
itself
except
to
cultivated
musicians
like
pendarves
the
same
accusations
were
made
against
handel
that
were
made
in
later
years
against
mozart
and
wagner
that
his
operas
were
noisy
and
overloaded
with
learned
accompaniments
the
italian
opera
was
killed
not
so
much
by
the
fact
that
beggar
made
its
conventions
ridiculous
for
its
conventions
could
at
that
time
have
been
ridiculous
only
to
quite
unmusical
people
as
by
the
incontestable
attraction
of
the
new
work
itself
it
was
witty
and
outspoken
with
abundance
of
topical
satire
its
music
consisted
of
the
tunes
that
everybody
knew
and
it
presented
the
public
with
the
irresistible
fascinations
of
lavinia
fenton
who
was
soon
to
become
the
duchess
of
bolton
handel
may
well
have
resented
the
success
of
beggar
but
the
collapse
of
the
academy
was
in
reality
no
great
disaster
for
his
own
interests
in
the
first
place
he
had
done
very
well
out
of
it
from
a
financial
point
of
view
the
noble
directors
might
have
lost
their
money
but
he
had
been
only
their
paid
servant
in
which
capacity
he
had
accumulated
enough
to
invest
no
less
than
of
his
own
in
the
next
operatic
venture
he
obviously
realised
the
strength
of
the
position
which
he
had
built
up
for
himself
both
as
a
composer
and
as
a
man
of
business
the
most
important
result
of
the
academy
career
had
been
to
provide
handel
with
the
opportunity
of
consolidating
his
own
style
as
a
composer
of
musical
drama
like
all
the
court
composers
of
his
age
he
had
provided
whatever
his
patrons
required
chamber
music
water
music
minuets
for
court
balls
church
music
for
royal
ceremonial
but
the
music
on
which
his
own
heart
was
set
was
that

handel
had
by
this
time
definitely
decided
to
make
england
his
home
on
february
he
had
been
naturalised
as
an
english
subject
he
had
every
reason
to
regard
england
as
the
best
place
in
which
to
live
he
enjoyed
the
protection
of
the
german
court
george
ii
and
queen
caroline
gave
him
indeed
a
good
deal
more
encouragement
than
george
i
the
appointments
of
composer
to
the
chapel
royal
and
composer
to
the
court
were
purely
honorary
but
they
strengthened
his
position
as
to
the
he
must
by
now
have
felt
that
he
was
its
unquestioned
autocrat
and
he
could
not
help
being
aware
that
he
was
without
a
rival
in
europe
as
far
as
the
stage
was
concerned
for
old
scarlatti
had
gone
to
his
grave
and
the
younger
generation
had
produced
no
composer
of
such
outstanding
eminence
and
in
england
music
was
generously
rewarded
from
a
material
point
of
view
high
fees
were
paid
not
only
to
singers
but
to
teachers
as
well
and
england
was
also
one
of
the
few
countries
where
was
a
flourishing
business
a
good
proportion
of
handel
savings
must
have
come
from
the
sale
of
his
published
compositions
among
handel
contemporaries
no
other
composer
in
europe
had
so
many
of
his
works
printed
during
his
lifetime
english
society
seemed
always
ready
to
subscribe
for
a
new
musical
work
and
neither
in
paris
nor
in
amsterdam
was
music
so
admirably
engraved
as
in
london
encouraged
by
the
princess
royal
handel
went
into
partnership
with
heidegger
who
had
also
made
his
own
profits
out
of
the
opera
as
well
as
out
of
his
notorious
masquerades
they
leased
the
king
theatre
for
a
period
of
five
years
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
secure
new
singers
and
for
this
purpose
handel
went
to
italy
probably
in
the
autumn
of
heidegger
had
already
tried
to
bring
back
senesino
and
the
two
costly
as
colley
cibber
called
them
but
they
had
had
enough
of
london
and
probably
of
handel
too
little
is
known
of
the
details
of
this
italian
journey
it
has
been
said
that
handel
travelled
with
steffani
but
this
is
impossible
as
steffani
died
at
frankfurt
early
in
the
year
mainwaring
tells
us
that
at
rome
cardinal
colonna
invited
him
to
his
palace
but
that
handel
hearing
that
the
pretender
was
staying
there
prudently
declined
the
invitation
in
engaging
singers
he
seems
to
have
been
perhaps
more
prudent
than
was
desirable
for
his
new
company
did
not
contain
any
very
distinguished
names
in
place
of
senesino
he
obtained
the
bernacchi
his
new
first
woman
was
signora
strada
del
po
who
was
a
fine
singer
but
so
unattractive
in
appearance
that
london
nicknamed
her
the
pig
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
he
also
engaged
a
tenor
annibale
fabri
although
in
those
days
tenors
were
considered
only
fit
for
old
men
parts
of
minor
importance
and
at
naples
were
generally
given
the
parts
of
comic
old
women
fabri
wife
and
another
woman
were
announced
as
good
actresses
of
male
parts
fabri
has
a
tenor
voice
wrote
pendarves
sweet
clear
and
firm
but
not
strong
enough
i
doubt
for
the
stage
he
sings
like
a
gentleman
without
making
faces
and
his
manner
is
particularly
agreeable
perhaps
handel
friendship
with
pendarves
had
given
him
a
sure
insight
into
the
taste
of
english
gentlewomen
in
the
summer
of
handel
paid
a
visit
to
his
mother
at
halle
she
was
then
blind
and
half
paralysed
bach
sent
his
son
friedemann
over
from
leipzig
to
beg
handel
to
come
and
see
him
as
he
was
himself
too
ill
to
make
the
journey
but
handel
not
unnaturally
declined
towards
the
end
of
june
he
passed
through
hanover
and
also
went
to
hamburg
where
he
engaged
a
german
bass
riemschneider
the
opera
season
began
on
december
with
handel
but
it
had
only
a
moderate
success
after
a
few
revivals
of
he
brought
out
a
second
new
opera
on
february
despite
its
many
beauties
it
was
even
less
successful
than
audience
did
not
go
to
the
theatre
to
listen
to
his
music
they
went
to
hear
the
singers
and
bernacchi
who
was
no
longer
a
young
man
was
a
poor
substitute
for
senesino
strada
was
the
only
member
of
the
company
who
interested
the
audience
for
the
next
season
something
better
had
to
be
found
and
through
francis
colman
the
english
envoy
at
florence
senesino
was
persuaded
to
accept
guineas
instead
of
the
that
he
had
received
before
he
opened
the
season
of
on
november
with
his
former
rôle
of
scipio
for
the
moment
handel
remained
in
the
background
the
next
opera
was
a
that
is
an
opera
made
up
of
favourite
songs
from
various
operas
stuck
into
any
convenient
libretto
on
february
there
came
out
the
new
opera
of
handel
which
turned
the
tide
once
more
in
the
composer
favour
later
on
and
were
revived
but
the
season
came
to
an
early
end
on
may
for
the
following
winter
some
changes
were
made
in
the
cast
senesino
and
strada
were
of
course
indispensable
and
the
most
important
new
acquisition
was
montagnana
the
bass
for
whom
handel
was
to
write
some
of
his
most
celebrated
songs
after
revivals
of
and
handel
brought
out
on
january
it
had
only
five
performances
february
had
ten
it
is
remembered
now
by
the
exquisite
song
rendi
sereno
al
ciglio
which
was
sung
by
strada
the
remainder
of
the
season
presented
nothing
of
any
special
interest
until
on
the
last
night
handel
offered
his
subscribers
a
new
type
of
entertainment
in
the
shape
of
and
on
handel
birthday
february
bernard
gates
the
master
of
the
children
of
the
chapel
royal
arranged
a
private
performance
of
which
had
been
neglected
since
its
first
performance
at
canons
some
twelve
years
before
among
the
boys
who
sang
and
acted
in
the
masque
were
beard
who
afterwards
became
handel
favourite
tenor
and
randall
eventually
professor
of
music
in
cambridge
who
took
the
part
of
esther
the
performance
was
repeated
twice
before
a
paying
public
at
the
crown
and
anchor
tavern
where
concerts
were
often
held
and
on
april
a
rival
organisation
advertised
a
further
performance
of
esther
at
the
in
villiers
street
on
this
occasion
it
was
described
as
an
oratorio
or
sacred
drama
and
was
evidently
sung
without
action
princess
anne
wished
to
see
it
on
the
stage
of
the
but
the
bishop
of
london
forbade
a
dramatic
performance
as
the
bishop
ban
was
ultimately
the
cause
of
handel
turning
his
attention
to
oratorio
in
preference
to
opera
it
has
sometimes
been
suggested
that
handel
might
have
created
a
new
type
of
national
english
opera
on
biblical
subjects
if
only
his
lordship
had
not
interfered
in
justice
to
the
bishop
it
has
to
be
pointed
out
that
his
objection
seems
to
have
been
raised
not
against
the
dramatic
presentation
of
bible
stories
for
he
did
not
discountenance
gates
performances
by
the
choristers
at
the
crown
and
anchor
but
against
their
presentation
in
a
regular
theatre
by
professional
opera
singers
such
prejudice
may
be
difficult
to
understand
at
the
present
day
but
even
well
into
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
persons
of
severe
morality
regarded
the
theatre
and
all
who
belonged
thereto
with
stern
disapproval
and
the
notorious
scandals
associated
with
cuzzoni
and
faustina
to
say
nothing
of
heidegger
were
not
likely
to
have
washed
out
the
memory
of
jeremy
denunciations
the
sacred
story
of
an
oratorio
in
english
was
accordingly
announced
for
may
with
the
information
that
there
will
be
no
acting
on
the
stage
but
the
house
will
be
fitted
up
in
a
decent
manner
for
the
audience
the
musick
the
orchestra
to
be
disposed
after
the
manner
of
the
coronation
service
within
a
fortnight
thomas
arne
father
of
the
composer
advertised
a
performance
of
and
at
the
little
theatre
in
the
haymarket
with
all
the
choruses
scenes
machines
and
other
decorations
being
the
first
time
it
was
performed
in
a
theatrical
way
the
laws
of
the
time
gave
no
protection
to
musical
and
dramatic
copyright
handel
could
only
reply
by
giving
a
performance
of
the
work
himself
his
one
advantage
was
that
as
composer
he
could
remodel
the
score
and
make
several
new
additions
to
it
but
he
did
not
have
the
work
acted
it
was
sung
in
costume
with
a
background
of
appropriate
scenery
even
in
this
form
it
obtained
four
performances
senesino
and
strada
took
part
in
it
singing
in
english
such
a
setting
may
appear
strange
to
modern
readers
but
even
if
it
was
a
new
idea
for
england
at
the
time
it
was
a
fairly
well
established
tradition
on
the
continent
and
handel
may
very
likely
have
seen
a
similar
entertainment
in
italy
the
subscribers
to
the
opera
would
see
little
in
it
that
was
incongruous
they
were
accustomed
to
see
singers
in
all
operas
wearing
dresses
that
differed
very
little
from
their
own
and
scenery
which
recalled
their
own
italianate
gardens
and
palaces
handelian
opera
in
any
case
left
little
scope
for
what
most
people
now
call
acting
at
the
same
time
we
may
be
pretty
sure
that
concert
singers
especially
italians
allowed
themselves
far
more
liberty
of
spontaneous
expressive
movement
than
victorian
oratorio
singers
holding
their
in
front
of
them
by
traditional
convention
four
more
performances
of
and
were
given
at
the
in
december
handel
evidently
saw
that
it
would
be
a
sure
attraction
and
were
revived
and
on
january
he
produced
a
new
opera
which
had
ten
performances
with
six
more
later
in
the
season
is
one
of
handel
most
original
operas
he
seems
always
to
have
derived
a
peculiar
inspiration
from
the
poems
of
tasso
and
ariosto
as
in
the
case
of
is
a
thoroughly
romantic
opera
chrysander
even
compares
it
with
those
of
weber
full
of
episodes
of
madness
and
magic
it
is
so
far
removed
from
the
ordinary
conventions
of
its
time
that
we
can
well
imagine
it
to
have
startled
both
its
audiences
and
its
singers
the
affairs
of
the
were
going
badly
and
it
is
probable
that
there
were
considerable
dissension
within
its
walls
it
is
certain
that
relations
between
handel
and
senesino
were
becoming
more
and
more
strained
was
the
last
opera
of
handel
in
which
he
sang
it
seems
fairly
certain
also
that
heidegger
was
none
too
loyal
as
a
partner
heidegger
was
in
a
strong
position
for
he
was
the
actual
owner
of
the
stock
of
scenery
and
other
appurtenances
taken
over
from
the
original
academy
he
seems
to
have
lent
the
theatre
to
buononcini
for
some
performances
of
and
when
the
lease
came
to
an
end
it
was
heidegger
who
left
handel
in
the
lurch
and
allowed
a
rival
organisation
to
secure
it
there
was
too
a
further
reason
for
the
general
hostility
against
handel
encouraged
by
the
success
of
and
he
had
composed
a
new
oratorio
which
was
performed
at
the
on
march
by
the
king
command
for
this
work
prices
were
doubled
tickets
were
a
guinea
each
and
admission
to
the
gallery
half
a
guinea
instead
of
five
shillings
at
the
second
performance
the
normal
prices
were
charged
the
raising
of
prices
for
an
extraordinary
performance
might
well
seem
nothing
unreasonable
but
the
event
came
exactly
at
the
moment
of
the
popular
outcry
against
walpole
excise
bill
and
the
satirists
of
the
day
seized
the
opportunity
of
comparing
handel
with
walpole
handel
was
now
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
in
the
days
of
he
had
been
a
young
man
of
making
friends
with
those
of
his
own
age
or
younger
a
new
attraction
with
all
the
fascination
of
genius
and
youth
in
the
course
of
a
generation
he
had
become
an
established
institution
he
had
made
a
success
he
had
amassed
a
fortune
he
had
secured
to
himself
the
unshaken
confidence
of
the
court
but
he
had
inevitably
made
enemies
the
native
musicians
were
very
naturally
jealous
of
the
foreigner
and
the
numerous
foreign
musicians
in
london
jealous
of
one
who
made
more
money
out
of
the
extravagant
english
than
they
did
themselves
the
italian
singers
found
him
tyrannical
and
society
very
probably
resented
his
rough
manners
society
had
engaged
him
to
provide
music
for
their
entertainment
and
he
took
up
the
attitude
of
expecting
society
to
pay
its
guineas
for
whatever
music
he
chose
to
write
england
one
might
almost
say
had
spoiled
him
for
it
was
only
in
england
that
the
great
bear
as
he
was
sometimes
called
could
go
his
own
way
a
musician
behaving
with
the
complete
disregard
of
public
opinion
which
was
considered
the
exclusive
privilege
of
the
english
nobility
in
any
other
country
he
would
have
been
forced
either
to
pander
to
the
taste
of
a
court
or
to
relapse
into
obscurity
it
was
not
until
after
the
french
revolution
that
a
beethoven
could
display
the
independence
of
handel
in
the
aristocratic
environment
of
vienna
the
english
nobility
having
set
handel
this
example
claimed
their
own
rights
and
organised
a
rival
at
lincoln
inn
fields
they
had
no
difficulty
in
seducing
first
senesino
then
montagnana
and
finally
heidegger
only
strada
remained
faithful
to
handel
buononcini
having
lost
their
favour
they
engaged
as
composer
the
neapolitan
nicolo
porpora
famous
then
as
a
great
trainer
of
singers
and
still
more
famous
in
later
years
as
the
teacher
of
haydn
if
handel
had
the
king
and
queen
on
his
side
the
nobility
could
count
on
the
support
of
frederick
prince
of
wales
who
was
immensely
popular
throughout
the
country
and
was
on
the
worst
possible
terms
with
his
royal
parents
the
opera
of
the
nobility
as
the
new
syndicate
was
called
was
making
its
plans
in
good
time
directly
after
the
end
of
handel
season
in
july
handel
was
invited
to
oxford
for
a
series
of
performances
of
his
works
and
it
was
proposed
to
confer
on
him
the
honorary
degree
of
doctor
of
music
the
holmes
was
a
loyal
hanoverian
and
hoped
by
honouring
handel
to
do
something
to
counteract
the
jacobite
reputation
of
the
university
and
were
performed
as
well
as
the
utrecht
and
and
the
coronation
anthems
handel
further
provided
a
new
oratorio
the
degree
he
refused
to
accept
for
what
reason
has
never
been
explained
various
suggestions
have
been
offered
the
abbé
prevost
who
was
in
england
at
the
time
says
that
he
refused
the
degree
out
of
modesty
later
biographers
have
differed
in
their
views
as
to
whether
modesty
was
one
of
handel
characteristics
others
have
supposed
that
he
refused
to
pay
the
fee
of
that
was
demanded
but
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
fee
should
have
been
demanded
for
an
honorary
degree
although
it
would
naturally
have
been
paid
by
candidates
who
took
the
degree
in
the
normal
way
the
concerts
were
attended
by
large
audiences
many
music
lovers
coming
over
from
eton
and
cambridge
although
there
was
considerable
resentment
at
the
price
of
admission
five
shillings
a
small
amount
compared
with
handel
london
charges
this
handel
festival
at
oxford
is
significant
for
it
shows
that
in
the
space
of
no
more
than
a
year
oratorio
had
begun
to
make
a
wide
appeal
even
outside
london
although
it
was
a
form
of
composition
that
was
new
to
english
audiences
considered
as
a
masque
to
be
acted
might
be
said
to
continue
the
english
traditions
of
the
previous
century
but
there
was
no
precedent
in
england
for
anything
like
in
concert
form
the
only
english
works
which
offered
anything
remotely
like
oratorio
were
the
odes
of
purcell
and
blow
for
the
musicians
festivals
on
cecilia
day
apart
from
the
greater
services
and
anthems
of
purcell
which
were
composed
not
for
entertainment
but
for
liturgical
use
after
the
oxford
concerts
handel
and
schmidt
went
to
italy
to
look
for
singers
they
heard
farinelli
the
most
famous
of
the
century
but
did
not
engage
him
perhaps
his
demands
were
too
high
the
whom
they
did
engage
was
carestini
who
though
less
celebrated
was
at
any
rate
a
singularly
artistic
singer
durastanti
came
back
and
in
place
of
montagnana
handel
contented
himself
with
waltz
a
german
who
is
often
described
as
having
been
handel
cook
burney
at
any
rate
recorded
that
he
was
said
to
have
filled
this
office
but
burney
remembered
him
chiefly
as
a
popular
comic
singer
he
had
sung
polyphemus
in
arne
pirated
performance
of
and
and
owing
to
the
defection
of
montagnana
took
his
place
in
at
oxford
he
had
a
coarse
figure
and
a
still
coarser
voice
burney
handel
opened
his
season
on
october
he
had
already
finished
the
composition
of
a
new
opera
but
it
was
not
brought
out
until
january
the
reason
no
doubt
was
that
an
opera
on
the
same
subject
by
porpora
was
produced
by
the
opera
of
the
nobility
on
december
handel
would
no
doubt
have
heard
that
it
was
in
rehearsal
and
have
postponed
his
own
production
until
he
could
see
how
porpora
was
succeeding
the
two
operas
obtained
the
same
number
of
performances
but
handel
theatre
was
seldom
full
and
many
were
dissatisfied
at
his
giving
them
oratorios
such
as
and
on
opera
nights
these
however
seem
to
have
been
commanded
by
the
king
and
that
in
itself
would
make
them
all
the
more
unpopular
in
march
the
princess
royal
was
married
to
the
prince
of
orange
and
handel
was
commissioned
to
write
a
wedding
anthem
he
also
provided
a
secular
entertainment
in
the
shape
of
in
described
as
a
it
was
not
unlike
a
masque
apollo
and
the
muses
appeared
in
costume
on
mount
parnassus
but
apparently
there
was
no
acting
the
music
was
adapted
from
which
so
far
had
only
been
heard
at
oxford
oratorio
was
also
attempted
by
handel
rival
pendarves
heard
a
work
of
his
at
lincoln
inn
fields
in
march
it
is
a
fine
solemn
piece
of
music
she
wrote
but
i
confess
i
think
the
subject
too
solemn
for
a
theatre
to
have
words
of
piety
made
use
of
only
to
introduce
good
music
is
reversing
what
it
ought
to
be
and
most
of
the
people
that
hear
the
oratorio
make
no
reflection
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
though
god
is
addressed
in
the
most
solemn
manner
needless
to
say
it
was
not
equal
to
handel
oratorio
of
esther
or
deborah
pendarves
was
at
this
time
a
near
neighbour
of
handel
in
lower
brook
street
one
of
her
letters
describes
a
small
musical
party
her
musical
parties
were
always
small
a
month
later
apparently
there
were
not
more
than
ten
guests
including
lord
shaftesbury
who
begged
another
guest
to
bring
him
and
was
admitted
as
being
a
profess
friend
of
handel
the
only
professional
musicians
present
were
handel
and
strada
i
never
was
so
well
entertained
at
an
opera
handel
was
in
the
best
humour
in
the
world
and
played
lessons
and
accompanied
strada
and
all
the
ladies
that
sung
from
seven
o
the
clock
till
eleven
in
such
company
handel
could
evidently
be
more
agreeable
than
on
the
stage
at
rehearsals
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
amateurs
had
no
timidity
about
singing
before
strada
and
that
handel
was
willing
to
accompany
all
of
them
alike
in
july
handel
lease
of
the
king
theatre
came
to
an
end
and
he
found
the
theatre
let
at
once
by
some
means
to
his
rivals
the
opera
of
the
nobility
he
therefore
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
rich
for
the
use
of
his
new
theatre
in
covent
garden
but
his
autumn
season
actually
opened
at
lincoln
inn
fields
on
october
the
probable
reason
for
this
was
that
the
princess
anne
was
spending
the
summer
in
england
and
wished
to
hear
some
of
handel
operas
she
was
a
remarkably
gifted
musician
and
handel
considered
her
to
be
the
best
of
his
pupils
she
not
only
sang
and
played
the
harpsichord
well
but
was
thoroughly
grounded
in
the
theoretical
side
of
music
and
quite
capable
of
composing
a
fugue
according
to
a
dutch
musician
who
became
acquainted
with
her
after
her
marriage
she
came
to
england
on
july
for
a
long
stay
and
at
once
persuaded
handel
to
give
three
additional
performances
of
pastor
which
he
had
revived
that
season
and
were
given
again
for
her
in
october
probably
covent
garden
was
not
quite
ready
for
performances
princess
anne
left
england
on
october
and
her
last
words
at
parting
were
to
beg
lord
hervey
to
do
all
he
could
to
help
handel
the
chief
attraction
to
the
public
at
covent
garden
was
probably
not
handel
but
mlle
sallé
a
french
dancer
who
had
been
engaged
by
rich
the
first
performance
at
the
new
theatre
was
a
ballet
in
order
that
she
might
inaugurate
the
season
which
includes
songs
and
a
chorus
served
as
prologue
to
pastor
the
next
opera
was
a
made
up
by
handel
himself
from
his
own
works
on
january
he
produced
his
ariodante
an
opera
over
which
he
had
spent
the
unusually
long
time
of
ten
weeks
the
score
was
begun
on
august
and
finished
on
october
the
story
is
taken
from
ariosto
and
as
with
orlando
handel
found
that
it
afforded
opportunities
for
his
peculiar
vein
of
romanticism
on
april
he
followed
it
up
with
alcina
again
on
a
subject
from
ariosto
and
one
of
even
more
romantic
character
enchantress
alcina
was
the
model
for
tasso
armida
who
provided
both
lulli
and
gluck
with
one
of
their
most
dramatic
heroines
and
burney
says
with
some
justice
that
handel
alcina
gave
birth
to
all
the
armidas
and
rinaldos
of
modern
times
both
ariodante
and
alcina
contained
a
large
amount
of
ballet
music
and
the
dances
in
alcina
intermingled
with
choruses
in
the
french
manner
are
among
handel
most
attractive
compositions
pendarves
after
the
rehearsal
of
alcina
described
handel
as
himself
a
necromancer
in
the
midst
of
his
own
enchantments
but
he
could
not
prevail
against
the
enchantments
of
farinelli
who
had
been
engaged
by
the
rival
opera
company
there
could
be
no
competing
against
a
combination
that
included
along
with
him
senesino
cuzzoni
and
montagnana
the
one
powerful
that
handel
could
offer
was
oratorio
on
wednesdays
and
fridays
in
lent
when
operas
were
not
allowed
to
be
given
porpora
david
which
the
rival
management
put
on
had
no
chance
against
esther
deborah
and
athaliah
alcina
carried
the
opera
on
to
the
end
of
the
season
the
air
verdi
prati
which
carestini
had
at
first
refused
to
sing
being
encored
at
every
performance
handel
alleged
angry
retort
to
carestini
in
comical
broken
english
has
been
often
quoted
from
burney
but
schoelcher
very
sensibly
observed
that
handel
was
pretty
certain
to
have
conversed
with
carestini
in
italian
the
newspapers
informed
the
world
in
may
that
handel
was
going
to
spend
the
summer
in
germany
his
health
had
been
seriously
undermined
and
it
may
well
have
been
possible
that
he
had
talked
of
taking
a
cure
at
but
on
this
occasion
he
went
no
farther
than
tunbridge
wells
it
was
probably
in
the
earlier
part
of
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
charles
jennens
a
young
man
who
was
eventually
to
play
a
great
part
in
his
life
for
on
july
he
wrote
to
jennens
to
say
that
he
was
just
starting
for
tunbridge
the
letter
is
so
short
that
it
may
be
quoted
here
in
full
for
it
gives
us
a
great
deal
of
interesting
information
london
sir
i
received
your
very
agreeable
letter
with
the
enclosed
oratorio
i
am
just
going
to
tunbridge
yet
what
i
could
read
of
it
in
haste
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
i
shall
have
more
leisure
time
there
to
read
it
with
all
the
attention
it
deserves
there
is
no
certainty
of
any
scheme
for
next
season
but
it
is
probable
that
something
or
other
may
be
done
of
which
i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
give
you
notice
being
extremely
obliged
to
you
for
the
generous
concern
you
show
upon
this
account
the
opera
of
alcina
is
a
writing
out
and
shall
be
sent
according
to
your
direction
it
is
always
a
great
pleasure
to
me
if
i
have
an
opportunity
to
show
the
sincere
respect
with
which
i
have
the
honour
to
be
sir
george
frideric
handel
jennens
was
a
conspicuous
figure
in
the
london
society
of
his
day
at
the
time
of
this
correspondence
he
was
and
unmarried
he
had
inherited
vast
wealth
in
his
youth
and
spent
it
freely
he
was
ostentatious
even
for
an
age
when
extravagance
was
fashionable
but
although
he
was
conceited
and
on
occasions
foolish
he
was
certainly
possessed
of
considerable
intellectual
gifts
and
the
things
which
interested
him
most
in
life
were
literature
music
and
the
fine
arts
the
letter
shows
us
that
he
must
have
admired
sufficiently
to
ask
the
composer
for
a
copy
of
the
score
he
also
seized
the
opportunity
of
offering
him
a
libretto
for
a
new
oratorio
he
had
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
as
a
poet
and
it
is
possible
that
he
foresaw
the
importance
of
the
new
type
of
entertainment
which
handel
was
creating
there
were
plenty
of
italian
poetasters
even
in
london
itself
who
could
put
together
a
conventional
but
english
oratorio
was
still
in
the
making
and
it
was
not
so
easy
to
find
a
literary
framework
for
it
in
any
case
it
was
evident
that
italian
opera
was
a
precarious
enterprise
in
october
the
papers
again
gave
out
that
handel
was
going
to
give
oratorios
and
concerts
at
covent
garden
no
operas
were
announced
and
for
the
time
being
handel
appeared
to
have
abandoned
opera
altogether
he
made
no
move
until
lent
and
then
brought
out
february
which
he
had
set
to
music
in
the
previous
two
months
those
ever
popular
favourites
and
and
followed
it
and
as
in
the
foregoing
season
handel
played
organ
concertos
between
the
acts
of
these
works
it
is
evident
that
as
handel
could
not
secure
the
great
italian
singers
for
his
oratorios
he
felt
obliged
to
offer
his
public
some
other
display
of
virtuosity
and
his
own
performance
on
the
organ
seems
to
have
been
considered
a
very
powerful
attraction
the
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
to
princess
augusta
of
april
provided
him
with
unexpected
opportunities
for
coming
before
the
public
it
seems
to
have
been
at
the
desire
of
the
princess
herself
that
he
undertook
a
short
italian
opera
season
of
eight
performances
which
eventually
was
extended
to
ten
new
opera
for
this
season
in
which
the
chief
singer
was
gizziello
then
making
his
first
appearance
in
england
was
composed
especially
to
celebrate
the
royal
nuptials
and
seems
to
have
finally
converted
the
prince
of
wales
to
the
music
of
handel
he
now
became
a
regular
supporter
of
handel
theatre
with
the
result
that
the
king
promptly
withdrew
his
patronage
as
he
refused
to
be
seen
in
the
same
house
as
the
prince
encouraged
by
this
sign
of
princely
favour
handel
reopened
covent
garden
in
november
with
a
revival
of
followed
by
three
more
new
operas
were
ready
or
nearly
so
handel
seems
to
have
prepared
himself
for
the
winter
in
better
time
than
usual
but
neither
january
nor
february
nor
even
with
its
famous
minuet
may
could
save
handel
from
ruin
the
rival
was
in
no
better
case
handel
was
obliged
to
close
covent
garden
on
june
and
the
haymarket
followed
suit
ten
days
later
opera
at
both
houses
had
been
killed
mainly
by
the
folly
of
party
strife
chapter
vi
bankruptcy
and
paralysis
visit
to
the
last
operas
vauxhall
gardens
handel
borrowings
visit
to
ireland
and
other
oratorios
the
collapse
of
the
opera
left
handel
not
only
bankrupt
but
with
seriously
endangered
health
in
april
it
had
been
announced
that
he
was
indisposed
with
the
rheumatism
from
which
he
made
a
slight
temporary
recovery
but
before
the
season
was
over
it
became
clear
that
he
was
suffering
from
paralysis
his
right
arm
was
become
useless
to
him
says
mainwaring
and
how
greatly
his
senses
were
disordered
at
intervals
for
a
long
time
appeared
from
an
hundred
instances
which
are
better
forgotten
than
recorded
with
some
difficulty
his
medical
advisers
persuaded
him
to
go
to
the
sulphur
bath
of
where
according
to
mainwaring
he
submitted
to
prolonged
and
drastic
treatment
his
cure
was
considered
remarkably
rapid
and
the
nuns
presumably
nursing
sisters
who
heard
him
play
the
organ
within
a
few
hours
of
leaving
his
bath
ascribed
it
to
a
miracle
such
a
conclusion
observes
our
clerical
biographer
in
such
persons
was
natural
enough
it
has
been
asserted
that
during
his
stay
at
aix
handel
composed
a
cantata
for
the
anniversary
of
the
foundation
of
elbing
a
town
in
east
prussia
between
danzig
and
königsberg
a
german
researcher
about
appears
to
have
discovered
documents
at
elbing
mentioning
the
cantata
with
the
name
of
the
poet
and
that
of
a
local
singer
jean
du
grain
who
composed
the
recitatives
handel
of
london
was
said
to
have
composed
the
choruses
no
trace
of
the
music
has
survived
and
there
seems
to
be
no
evidence
whatever
to
connect
this
work
with
handel
visit
to
aix
nor
is
it
possible
to
suggest
any
reason
why
the
authorities
of
this
remote
place
should
have
applied
to
handel
for
a
composition
according
to
mainwaring
handel
stayed
six
weeks
at
aix
the
london
papers
announced
his
return
on
november
the
management
of
the
opera
had
now
been
taken
over
by
heidegger
but
the
death
of
queen
caroline
on
november
caused
all
theatres
to
be
closed
from
that
date
until
the
end
of
december
it
was
announced
in
the
papers
that
the
opera
would
reopen
on
january
with
a
new
oratorio
by
handel
called
but
this
performance
did
not
take
place
and
the
theatre
actually
reopened
on
january
with
his
new
opera
this
opera
was
the
first
work
that
handel
had
undertaken
after
his
return
to
london
but
its
composition
was
interrupted
by
that
of
the
funeral
anthem
for
the
queen
although
she
died
on
november
handel
did
not
receive
the
king
command
to
write
the
anthem
until
december
as
george
ii
was
strangely
undecided
in
making
arrangements
for
the
funeral
it
was
finally
fixed
for
december
and
a
special
organ
was
hurriedly
built
for
it
in
henry
vii
chapel
at
westminster
abbey
handel
anthem
was
performed
by
singers
and
instrumentalists
queen
caroline
had
been
one
of
his
most
faithful
friends
and
his
gratitude
and
affection
for
her
found
utterance
in
music
which
burney
placed
at
the
head
of
all
his
works
for
expression
harmony
and
pleasing
effects
it
was
at
ten
at
night
on
christmas
eve
that
handel
finished
the
score
of
on
boxing
day
he
began
the
composition
of
had
only
six
performances
and
did
not
appear
on
the
stage
until
april
when
it
ran
for
five
nights
only
it
is
remembered
now
if
at
all
by
the
fact
that
the
first
song
in
it
is
the
celebrated
largo
but
the
opera
as
a
whole
is
of
curious
interest
he
was
neither
in
health
prosperity
or
spirits
says
burney
when
it
was
composed
appearances
remain
in
his
foul
score
rough
copy
of
a
mind
disturbed
if
not
diseased
there
are
more
passages
and
even
whole
pages
cancelled
in
this
score
than
in
any
one
of
all
his
former
operas
it
must
be
explained
is
a
comic
opera
and
the
only
comic
opera
that
handel
ever
wrote
what
induced
him
to
attempt
this
style
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
failure
of
earlier
operas
was
largely
due
to
the
success
of
and
of
other
comic
entertainments
which
succeeded
it
and
dragon
of
a
new
type
of
comic
opera
had
arisen
in
italy
too
and
comic
were
first
seen
in
italian
grand
opera
in
london
in
january
although
it
was
not
until
that
a
real
company
of
italian
singers
came
over
to
england
but
what
is
more
important
to
notice
is
that
the
whole
style
of
italian
opera
was
changing
during
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
handel
had
continued
to
develop
his
own
style
based
on
the
grand
manner
of
old
scarlatti
but
handel
operas
were
practically
unknown
outside
london
and
hamburg
in
italy
scarlatti
style
had
already
become
before
his
death
in
and
opera
was
moving
on
towards
the
lighter
and
flimsier
manner
of
galuppi
who
first
came
to
london
in
this
year
of
in
choosing
the
libretto
of
handel
seems
to
have
been
making
a
desperate
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
taste
of
the
day
humour
he
had
in
plenty
one
has
only
to
recall
and
but
the
humour
of
diverting
as
it
is
to
the
modern
historical
student
is
neither
the
musical
nor
the
dramatic
humour
of
the
plot
bears
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
neapolitan
comic
operas
of
vinci
and
pergolesi
but
rather
recalls
the
very
early
operas
based
on
spanish
comedies
composed
by
alessandro
scarlatti
in
the
was
revived
a
few
years
ago
in
germany
considerably
cut
about
and
reduced
to
one
act
in
which
arrangement
it
had
some
success
but
we
can
well
understand
its
complete
failure
on
its
first
london
production
the
only
satisfaction
which
handel
received
in
that
unfortunate
season
of
was
the
proceeds
of
his
benefit
concert
at
the
haymarket
on
march
organised
for
him
by
his
friends
apparently
rather
against
his
own
wish
according
to
burney
the
net
receipts
were
mainwaring
puts
the
figure
at
even
if
we
accept
burney
estimate
the
sum
is
remarkable
and
particularly
so
in
view
of
the
known
hostility
of
a
large
section
of
society
towards
the
composer
it
can
only
be
supposed
that
physical
and
mental
collapse
had
been
grave
enough
to
awaken
a
sense
of
pity
for
his
misfortunes
another
mark
of
popular
appreciation
was
the
erection
of
a
statue
of
handel
executed
by
roubiliac
at
vauxhall
gardens
in
recognition
of
the
pleasure
which
his
music
had
afforded
to
the
frequenters
of
that
famous
resort
this
piece
of
laudable
idolatry
as
burney
calls
it
was
thus
described
by
a
contemporary
journalist
handel
is
represented
in
a
loose
robe
sweeping
the
lyre
and
listening
to
its
sounds
which
a
little
boy
sculptured
at
his
feet
seems
to
be
writing
down
on
the
back
of
a
the
whole
composition
is
in
an
elegant
taste
commissioned
by
an
impresario
who
had
made
a
fortune
out
of
the
use
of
handel
music
it
now
appropriately
adorns
the
vestibule
of
novello
in
wardour
street
charles
jennens
writing
to
his
cousin
lord
guernsey
on
september
remarks
that
handel
head
is
more
full
of
maggots
than
ever
towards
the
end
of
july
he
had
begun
the
composition
of
for
which
jennens
had
provided
the
libretto
three
years
before
it
is
evident
that
handel
intended
to
startle
his
audiences
with
his
new
oratorio
scheme
he
had
ordered
a
new
organ
for
the
theatre
at
a
cost
of
constructed
so
that
he
might
have
a
better
command
of
his
performers
and
he
had
also
acquired
another
instrument
which
jennens
calls
a
tubalcain
in
other
words
a
set
of
bells
played
from
a
keyboard
which
he
intended
to
use
in
the
scene
in
which
the
israelites
welcome
david
after
his
victory
over
the
philistines
it
is
curious
that
handel
should
have
dramatised
the
insanity
of
saul
just
after
he
had
himself
recovered
from
mental
derangement
no
sooner
was
finished
september
than
handel
four
days
later
began
the
composition
of
in
was
first
performed
on
january
and
enjoyed
a
moderate
success
but
april
was
a
failure
even
after
it
had
been
shortened
and
made
more
attractive
by
the
insertion
of
italian
opera
songs
in
is
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
a
strange
and
almost
unaccountable
habit
which
from
about
this
period
began
to
show
itself
in
handel
methods
of
composition
the
incorporation
of
large
quantities
of
music
by
other
composers
samuel
wesley
was
the
first
person
to
draw
attention
to
this
practice
of
handel
though
only
in
a
private
letter
of
in
crotch
in
his
professorial
lectures
at
oxford
named
no
less
than
composers
whom
handel
had
quoted
or
copied
the
researches
of
chrysander
max
seiffert
ebenezer
prout
and
sedley
taylor
eventually
proved
beyond
dispute
that
not
only
but
several
other
works
of
handel
were
largely
made
up
from
the
music
of
other
men
chrysander
maintained
that
handel
began
appropriating
other
men
ideas
as
early
as
for
not
only
and
but
also
and
the
show
obvious
reminiscences
of
keiser
opera
hamburg
these
were
probably
subconscious
like
handel
reminiscences
of
scarlatti
and
others
at
this
period
they
need
not
be
taken
any
more
seriously
than
schubert
frequent
reminiscences
of
beethoven
but
in
and
prout
discovered
quotations
and
adaptations
several
bars
long
from
a
by
graun
which
is
known
to
have
been
composed
not
many
years
before
further
fragments
of
this
were
identified
by
prout
in
and
the
like
incorporates
several
movements
from
a
by
urio
from
this
date
onwards
until
the
end
of
his
career
handel
systematically
drew
upon
the
works
of
other
musicians
there
has
been
much
controversy
over
this
question
and
many
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
away
handel
borrowings
so
as
to
leave
no
moral
stain
on
his
character
which
indeed
by
all
contemporary
accounts
was
scrupulously
upright
sedley
taylor
was
certainly
anxious
to
clear
handel
character
but
still
more
concerned
to
arrive
at
the
exact
truth
and
his
method
of
presenting
the
evidence
throws
a
new
light
on
procedure
he
showed
that
in
most
cases
handel
made
frequent
alterations
in
the
music
which
he
utilised
almost
as
if
stradella
to
cite
one
name
out
of
many
had
been
a
young
pupil
to
whom
he
was
giving
a
lesson
in
composition
a
careful
study
of
these
alterations
suggests
a
reason
for
handel
action
which
seems
not
to
have
occurred
to
any
previous
writer
on
the
subject
no
one
seems
to
have
noticed
hitherto
that
handel
borrowings
begin
in
on
a
small
scale
and
become
more
frequent
in
after
which
they
develop
into
a
regular
habit
it
seems
only
natural
therefore
to
connect
them
with
handel
mental
collapse
it
became
acute
in
the
spring
of
but
it
may
well
have
been
approaching
in
the
previous
year
there
is
no
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
handel
suffered
from
moral
insanity
and
was
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
right
and
wrong
but
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
his
paralytic
stroke
affected
his
brain
in
such
a
way
that
he
may
sometimes
have
had
a
difficulty
in
starting
a
composition
biographers
of
handel
have
more
than
once
drawn
attention
to
phases
in
which
he
seems
to
have
suffered
from
the
inability
to
make
a
definite
decision
indecision
is
a
common
symptom
of
overstrained
nerves
and
anyone
who
has
attempted
musical
composition
or
taught
it
to
students
will
understand
the
hesitation
and
uncertainty
which
often
attends
the
first
writing
down
of
a
musical
theme
although
once
the
initial
idea
has
been
settled
the
continuation
and
development
of
it
may
proceed
without
difficulty
any
musician
who
studies
the
examples
printed
by
sedley
taylor
will
at
once
exclaim
that
for
a
man
of
handel
experience
to
say
nothing
of
his
fertility
or
indeed
of
his
genius
it
would
have
been
far
less
trouble
to
compose
an
original
setting
of
given
words
than
to
adapt
them
so
laboriously
to
music
written
by
someone
else
for
a
totally
different
purpose
but
after
his
attack
of
paralysis
there
may
well
have
been
occasional
moments
when
handel
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
write
down
an
idea
of
his
own
but
may
very
likely
have
found
that
when
once
he
had
an
idea
ready
on
paper
before
him
whether
that
of
another
composer
or
an
old
one
of
his
own
he
could
then
continue
to
compose
and
often
make
alterations
in
the
music
under
his
eyes
which
transformed
it
from
a
commonplace
into
a
masterpiece
in
the
autumn
of
handel
transferred
his
concerts
to
the
smaller
theatre
in
lincoln
inn
fields
where
at
first
there
seemed
some
hope
of
success
on
november
he
produced
his
setting
of
dryden
for
cecilia
it
was
repeated
several
times
and
and
being
added
to
the
programmes
but
a
month
later
an
exceptionally
severe
frost
set
in
the
thames
was
frozen
over
and
for
two
months
it
was
useless
to
open
the
theatre
owing
to
the
impossibility
of
warming
it
adequately
in
february
he
produced
adapted
by
charles
jennens
from
milton
and
to
which
jennens
had
added
a
third
part
of
his
own
but
the
public
whether
from
indifference
to
the
work
or
from
fear
of
the
cold
refused
to
come
to
it
handel
was
once
more
on
the
verge
of
ruin
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
giving
a
performance
of
his
two
most
popular
works
and
for
the
benefit
of
a
new
musical
charity
the
charity
in
which
handel
was
so
keenly
interested
had
been
founded
in
to
assist
impoverished
musicians
and
their
families
it
still
carries
on
its
honourable
work
under
the
title
of
the
royal
society
of
musicians
of
great
britain
the
same
year
saw
the
inauguration
of
another
charitable
institution
which
owed
much
to
the
continued
generosity
of
handel
the
foundling
hospital
like
hogarth
who
was
also
a
benefactor
handel
did
not
confine
his
support
to
an
occasional
gift
but
took
the
warmest
personal
interest
in
the
place
and
eventually
both
he
and
hogarth
were
made
governors
of
it
the
managers
of
the
opera
had
found
themselves
quite
unable
to
continue
productions
on
the
grand
scale
of
former
years
in
the
winter
of
there
had
been
an
insignificant
season
at
covent

it
seems
to
have
been
directed
by
the
italian
composer
pescetti
who
in
the
following
winter
started
concerts
at
the
little
theatre
in
the
haymarket
pendarves
who
during
the
last
few
years
had
not
lived
much
in
london
and
had
thus
dropped
out
of
handel

burney
gives
a
comic
account
of
the
undertaking
the
opera
a
tawdry
expensive
and
meretricious
lady
who
had
been
accustomed
to
high
keeping
was
now
reduced
to
a
very
humble
state
her
establishment
was
not
only
diminished
but
her
servants
reduced
to
pescetti
seems
to
have
been

prime

the
muscovita
her
favourite

and
andreoni
a
servant
for
all
work
concerts
and
formed
the
main
repertory
and
burney
ascribes
such
success
as
they
enjoyed
to
the
fact
that
the
little
theatre
was
a
snug
retreat
in
which
those
who
had
the
courage
to
quit
their
firesides
during
the
great
frost
might
keep
reasonably
warm
handel
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
theatre
but
in
again
rented
the
theatre
in
lincoln
inn
fields
where
on
november
he
revived
in
in
its
original
oratorio
manner
with
the
addition
of
scenes
dresses
and
concertos
on
the
organ
and
several
other
instruments
it
had
but
one
performance
on
the
handel
produced
a
new
opera
or
as
burney
calls
it
an
which
had
no
more
than
two
performances
this
was
on
january
he
brought
out
another
new
opera
which
ran
for
three
nights
is
a
work
of
little
importance
on
the
other
hand
contains
several
very
beautiful
songs
but
burney
notwithstanding
his
admiration
of
it
has
to
admit
that
much
of
it
was
in
the
style
of
handel
youth
and
sometimes
languid
and
antique
to
handel
admirers
such
criticism
may
seem
ridiculous
but
to
his
audiences
of
these
reversions
to
an
earlier
style
would
certainly
have
been
most
unwelcome
was
handel
last
work
for
the
stage
the
glorious
achievements
of
his
youth
and
maturity
had
come
to
a
hopeless
end
his
own
public
had
unjustly
neglected
him
posterity
consigned
his
operas
to
oblivion
at
some
period
during
the
summer
of
handel
received
an
invitation
from
the
fourth
duke
of
devonshire
then
of
ireland
to
go
over
to
dublin
and
give
concerts
there
for
the
benefit
of
the
local
hospitals
it
is
very
probable
that
pendarves
may
have
helped
to
secure
this
engagement
for
handel
she
had
spent
a
year
and
a
half
in
ireland
in
and
her
letters
give
a
lively
account
of
society
in
dublin
matthew
dubourg
an
excellent
violinist
was
at
the
head
of
the
band
and
musical
entertainments
were
frequent
for
to
judge
from
pendarves
descriptions
the
irish
bishops
and
deans
lived
almost
as
magnificently
as
the
cardinals
in
rome
pendarves
was
naturally
a
very
popular
guest
in
dublin
society
she
was
a
remarkably
fine
harpsichord
player
for
an
amateur
and
was
constantly
in
demand
as
a
performer
at
private
parties
there
was
no
one
in
london
or
dublin
who
had
a
more
intelligent
understanding
of
handel
music
and
her
enthusiasm
for
his
works
was
unbounded
she
kept
constantly
in
touch
with
dublin
life
when
in
england
for
she
corresponded
with
dean
swift
and
what
was
more
important
still
she
had
in
made
the
acquaintance
of
delany
an
irish
clergyman
whom
she
was
to
marry
in
handel
did
not
leave
london
until
the
first
week
of
november
during
the
summer
he
had
been
occupied
with
the
composition
of
a
new
oratorio
the
words
for
which
had
been
chosen
and
arranged
by
jennens
apparently
with
a
good
deal
of
assistance
from
his
chaplain
the
rev
pooley
whether
was
composed
with
a
view
to
production
in
dublin
is
not
known
it
was
begun
on
august
and
finished
on
september
a
fortnight
later
he
had
completed
the
first
act
of
on
the
way
to
holyhead
he
stopped
at
chester
where
he
was
obliged
to
stay
several
days
on
account
of
contrary
winds
which
prevented
his
embarking
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
try
over
some
of
the
choruses
of
with
local
and
burney
who
was
at
school
at
chester
gives
an
amusing
account
of
the
little
rehearsal
at
which
handel
was
roused
to
grotesque
fury
by
the
inability
of
the
bass
a
printer
by
trade
to
read
and
with
his
stripes
at
sight
on
november
he
arrived
in
dublin
and
opened
his
season
at
neal
new
in
fishamble
street
on
december
with
a
performance
of
interspersed
with
concertos
a
few
days
later
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
jennens
describing
the
unprecedented
success
which
he
had
enjoyed
dublin
received
him
with
open
arms
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
triumph
the
more
so
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
unusually
good
health
a
series
of
concerts
followed
at
which
various
oratorios
and
other
works
were
performed
on
april
there
was
a
rehearsal
of
open
to
those
who
had
taken
tickets
for
the
first
performance
which
took
place
on
tuesday
april
the
choir
was
provided
by
the
singers
from
the
two
cathedrals
some
of
whom
took
the
male
solo
parts
as
well
the
female
soloists
were
cibber
and
signora
avolio
over
seven
hundred
persons
were
present
and
about
was
divided
between
the
three
charities
the
relief
of
prisoners
mercer
hospital
and
the
charitable
infirmary
was
performed
on
may
and
a
second
performance
of
took
place
on
june
handel
left
ireland
on
august
in
another
letter
to
jennens
he
says
that
his
plans
for
the
winter
are
undecided
for
this
time
september
he
intended
to
continue
his
oratorios
in
ireland
for
some
reason
or
other
this
second
visit
to
ireland
never
took
place
it
was
not
until
february
that
handel
came
before
the
london
public
again
with
which
unlike
most
of
his
oratorios
had
an
immediate
success
he
had
by
this
time
dropped
the
italian
singers
altogether
and
depended
mainly
on
cibber
and
john
beard
a
tenor
who
had
more
sense
of
artistic
style
than
power
of
voice
mr
flower
says
that
his
voice
was
more
powerful
than
sweet
horace
walpole
who
heard
him
said
that
he
had
only
one
note
in
it
and
pendarves
whose
judgment
was
probably
more
trustworthy
said
that
he
had
no
voice
at
all
the
first
london
performance
of
was
given
on
march
but
it
had
no
more
than
two
subsequent
repetitions
this
season
there
were
many
reasons
why
it
should
have
fallen
flat
jennens
himself
was
extremely
dissatisfied
with
it
had
been
a
failure
too
and
it
is
extremely
probable
that
musical
people
accustomed
to
the
italian
opera
were
estranged
by
a
setting
of
bible
words
in
prose
instead
of
a
libretto
in
verse
laid
out
on
more
or
less
dramatic
lines
william
law
had
been
published
in
the
book
makes
frequent
allusions
to
the
frivolity
of
italian
opera
and
is
picked
out
as
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
irreligious
persons
in
john
wesley
first
began
to
preach
in
the
open
air
in
edward
young
achieved
its
extraordinary
popularity
these
three
events
were
all
significant
of
the
religious
movement
that
was
taking
place
among
the
more
cultured
classes
in
england
and
this
movement
undoubtedly
affected
handel
oratorio
concerts
the
were
shocked
at
the
association
of
sacred
subjects
with
the
theatre
those
who
could
combine
religion
with
culture
like
delany
who
was
now
approaching
the
age
of
piety
were
handel
most
earnest
supporters
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
section
of
society
which
preferred
its
culture
unmixed
with
religion
resented
the
attitude
of
the
second
party
even
more
than
that
of
the
first
because
the
second
party
belonged
to
their
own
social
class
and
this
resentment
may
well
have
contributed
to
the
hostility
shown
by
many
social
leaders
toward
handel
and
handel
personal
oddities
were
becoming
rapidly
more
acute
partly
owing
to
increasing
age
and
still
more
owing
to
recurrences
of
paralysis
and
associated
mental
derangement
he
had
another
attack
in
this
very
year
and
were
composed
at
a
more
favourable
moment
and
show
little
use
of
borrowed
material
except
that
incorporates
some
of
handel
own
chamber
duets
the
melodies
of
which
were
more
suitably
illustrative
of
their
original
italian
words
than
of
the
sentences
from
scripture
to
which
he
adapted
them
but
his
next
important
work
the
in
celebration
of
the
victory
at
dettingen
june
begun
in
july
and
performed
on
november
incorporates
no
less
than
nine
movements
from
the
latin
by
urio
already
drawn
upon
for
in
delany
was
all
raptures
and
thought
it
excessively
fine
it
is
curious
that
whereas
the
dettingen
was
largely
based
on
borrowed
material
semele
composed
in
the
previous
month
of
june
should
be
as
far
as
is
at
present
known
entirely
original
the
libretto
had
been
written
by
congreve
in
for
an
opera
and
it
was
only
natural
that
its
theatrical
sense
and
its
literary
grace
and
distinction
should
have
inspired
handel
to
one
of
his
loveliest
works
handel
was
never
quite
at
home
in
the
english
language
but
in
his
later
years
he
seems
to
have
developed
a
feeling
for
english
poetry
more
especially
for
that
of
approximately
his
own
time
but
did
not
attract
the
opera
audience
it
became
increasingly
clear
that
the
opera
party
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
handel
and
were
in
fact
deliberately
doing
all
they
could
to
bring
him
to
ruin
delany
and
a
few
other
great
ladies
remained
faithful
but
they
were
in
a
small
minority
it
was
evidently
the
younger
generation
who
were
in
opposition
delany
alludes
to
them
as
the
goths
the
fine
ladies
the
and
the
ignoramuses
and
seemed
surprised
that
they
allowed
the
oratorio
to
be
performed
without
making
a
disturbance
delany
was
settling
down
to
being
the
wife
of
a
dean
march
fared
no
better
and
handel
himself
was
mightily
out
of
humour
about
it
at
the
rehearsals
the
summer
was
devoted
to
the
composition
of
for
which
jennens
had
supplied
the
libretto
the
collaboration
was
not
altogether
happy
for
although
jennens
had
considerable
sense
of
the
picturesque
and
offered
handel
opportunities
for
what
may
be
called
spectacular
music
on
the
grand
scale
his
literary
style
was
pompous
rhetorical
and
handel
protested
perpetually
against
the
length
of
the
work
for
the
handelian
style
of
composition
naturally
extended
the
prolixity
of
the
words
jennens
greatly
resented
the
musician
criticism
and
insisted
on
printing
the
poem
in
full
when
the
winter
came
handel
produced
nothing
of
importance
until
january
when
he
brought
out
a
secular
oratorio
which
he
had
composed
in
the
summer
during
intervals
when
had
to
be
laid
aside
owing
to
jennens
delays
was
given
on
march
and
were
revived
but
whatever
oratorio
was
given
the
theatre
was
almost
empty
and
the
season
came
to
a
premature
end
on
april
handel
was
again
suffering
from
some
form
of
illness
and
was
unable
to
take
any
part
in
the
performances
although
he
was
present
at
them
lady
shaftesbury
describes
the
great
though
unhappy
handel
dejected
wan
and
dark
sitting
by
not
playing
on
the
harpsichord
and
adds
that
his
light
had
been
spent
in
being
overplied
in
music
cause
hawkins
states
definitely
that
handel
became
blind
in
and
this
date
has
been
generally
accepted
lady
shaftesbury
letter
suggests
that
he
was
already
blind
or
partially
so
as
early
as
march
unless
the
word
light
is
to
be
taken
as
meaning
the
light
of
his
reason
this
interpretation
in
fact
is
confirmed
by
a
later
letter
of
lord
shaftesbury
in
october
in
which
he
says
poor
handel
looks
something
better
i
hope
he
will
entirely
recover
in
due
time
though
he
has
been
a
good
deal
disordered
in
the
head
another
friend
of
handel
william
harris
met
him
in
london
in
august
when
he
seems
at
first
not
to
have
recognised
harris
and
to
have
behaved
with
some
oddity
he
talked
much
of
his
precarious
state
of
health
yet
he
looks
well
enough
it
has
generally
been
stated
that
in
handel
again
became
bankrupt
but
barclay
squire
pointed
out
that
his
name
does
not
occur
in
the
official
lists
of
bankrupts
it
must
be
remembered
that
however
disastrous
his
opera
or
oratorio
seasons
were
he
had
always
his
permanent
pension
of
a
year
to
fall
back
on
and
hawkins
states
that
this
pension
originally
granted
by
queen
anne
and
george
i
was
punctually
paid
throughout
his
life
from
the
end
of
august
london
was
in
a
panic
over
the
jacobite
rebellion
under
the
young
pretender
charles
edward
the
opera
remained
closed
on
account
of
the
prejudice
against
the
papist
italian
singers
at
the
other
theatres
patriotism
expressed
itself
in
appropriate
music
genius
of
england
was
sung
at

britannia
at
another
and
on
november
a
chorus
song
set
by
handel
for
the
of
the
city
of
london
was
sung
by
lowe
at
drury
lane
the
words
suggest
that
the
anonymous
author
was
familiar
with
the
epilogue
to
purcell
handel
music
is
neither
in
his
own
style
nor
in
purcell
but
resembles
the
poorest
sort
of
english
patriotic
song
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
patriotic
poetry
was
well
illustrated
by
an
additional
verse

on
december
the
pretender
began
his
retreat
from
derby
and
panic
was
allayed
handel
seized
the
opportunity
to
compose
and
bring
out
his
about
half
of
which
was
taken
from
in
it
contains
a
quotation
of
rule
britannia
and
the
point
of
the
quotation
is
made
clearer
when
we
know
that
it
was
one
of
the
patriotic
songs
sung
at
the
theatres
during
the
period
of
panic
the
duke
of
cumberland
defeat
of
the
pretender
at
culloden
on
april
finally
disposed
of
the
jacobites
and
handel
made
a
further
contribution
to
the
national
rejoicings
in
a
song
on
the
victory
over
the
rebels
which
was
printed
in
the

britain
in
the
same
month
handel
began
the
composition
of
a
new
oratorio
in
honour
of
the
duke
this
was
for
which
he
had
discovered
a
new
librettist
the
rev
thomas
morell
formerly
fellow
of
king
college
cambridge
morell
has
given
a
lively
account
of
his
collaboration
with
the
great
man
whom
he
did
not
fear
to
criticise
handel
retorts
to
him
have
been
reproduced
as
if
they
were
outbursts
of
righteous
indignation
against
a
snarling
poetaster
but
in
view
of
many
other
records
of
rough
tongue
and
genial
humour
in
which
he
seems
often
to
have
resembled
brahms
we
need
not
take
them
too
seriously
it
is
quite
clear
that
morell
was
more
amused
than
offended
and
the
fact
that
they
continued
to
collaborate
up
to
the
end
of
handel
career
as
a
composer
shows
that
they
must
have
remained
on
completely
friendly
terms
morell
to
judge
from
the
contemporary
portrait
of
him
must
have
been
a
rather
comic
little
figure
with
a
strong
sense
of
humour
he
was
a
scholar
and
something
of
a
musician
too
the
academic
primness
of
his
verses
has
endeared
him
to
all
lovers
of
handel
and
to
no
one
more
than
samuel
butler
they
are
always
admirably
suited
to
their
purpose
neat
and
scholarly
concise
and
direct
with
never
a
word
too
many
they
run
easily
for
a
singer
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
morell
was
acquainted
with
the
works
of
that
great
model
of
all
metastasio
for
his
words
like
metastasio
acquire
an
unexpected
beauty
when
they
are
sung

must
have
felt
himself
fully
restored

health

which

up

system
and
opened

the
relief
produced
by
the
victory
of

had
no
doubt
encouraged
the
general
public
to
spend
more
money
on
entertainments
the

was
a
popular
hero
and
through
the
handel
name
had
come
to
be
associated
with
him
was
naturally
patronised
by
the
court
and
by
the
duke
himself
who
had
made
a
handsome
present
to
morell
in
recognition
of
his
literary
laurels
and
a
new
class
of
enthusiasts
appeared

shape

are
told
who
were
attracted
by
the
glorification
of

of

we
do
not
hear
much
of
the
jewish
community
in
london
in
the
days
of
handel
and
it
can
not
have
been
a
very
large
one
but
they
appear
to
have
been
worth
handel
consideration
it
may
be
mentioned
that
handel
early
librettist
in
london
nicolo
haym
must
have
been
a
jew
to
judge
from
his
name
handel
at
any
rate
was
sufficiently
impressed
to
ask
morell
to
find
another
jewish
subject
for
his
next
oratorio
this
was
produced
the
following
year
the
italian
opera
party
had
this
year
engaged
gluck
as
a
composer
and
he
too
celebrated
the
duke
of
cumberland
achievements
with
an
opera
caduta

which
was
a
complete
failure
it
must
have
been
put
together
in

for
all
of
the
favourite
songs
in
it
published
by
walsh
and
no
other
record
of
the
music
remains
were
taken
from
earlier
operas
of
gluck
in
any
case
they
are
poor
stuff
and
from
burney
description
of
the
singers
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
opera
had
no
success
gluck
called
on
handel
who
told
someone
that
he
knew
no
more
of
counterpoint
than
his
cook
gluck
was
just
under
thirty
handel
just
over
sixty
and
one
can
understand
handel
attitude
in
any
case
he
gave
him
some
plain
and
practical
advice
as
to
how
to
please
an
english
audience
which
was
not
much
use
to
gluck
as
he
never
visited
this
country
again
handel
was
quite
right
in
his
criticism
for
gluck
was
always
very
clumsy
in
his
technique
and
at
any
rate
gluck
found
him
friendly
enough
and
spoke
of
him
forty
years
later
with
the
profoundest
respect
it
is
probable
that
gluck
heard
as
he
was
still
in
london
in
april
a
significant
indication
of
the
new
popularity
which
handel
had
acquired
was
the
production
of
a
at
the
italian
opera
in
november
made
up
chiefly
from
the
operas
of
handel
but
the
experiment
was
not
repeated
in
the
autumn
of
a
company
of
italian
singers
came
over
to
london
they
brought
an
entirely
new
type
of
entertainment
and
after
their
success
handelian
opera
was
buried
for
ever
was
not
one
of
handel
popular
works
march
is
now
pretty
well
forgotten
but
was
a
great
attraction
when
new
mainly
because
it
contained
see
the
conquering
hero
which
was
afterwards
transferred
to
what
the
english
like
is
something
that
they
can
beat
time
to
said
handel
to
gluck
he
agreed
with
hawkins
in
not
caring
very
much
for
it
himself
but
added
you
will
live
to
see
it
a
greater
favourite
with
the
people
than
my
other

from

not
known
who

their
libretti

been
tentatively
ascribed
to
morell

remarkably
successful
perhaps
on
account
of
its
story
which
has
always
been
a
favourite
with
the
painters
of
the
later
renaissance
one
can
understand
lady
shaftesbury
saying
i
believe
it
will
not
insinuate
itself
so
much
into
my
approbation
as
most
of
handel
performances
do
as
it
is
in
the
light
operatic
style
was
a
complete
contrast
with
its
magnificent
scenes
of
oriental
pageantry
the
peace
of
october
had
no
doubt
contributed
as
the
victory
of
culloden
did
to
make
people
more
inclined
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
life
with
beneficial
results
to
the
organisers
of
music
and
drama
the
king
ordered
a
grand
celebration
of
the
event
to
take
place
on
april
and
preparations
for
it
were
begun
as
early
as
the
preceding
november
the
famous
theatrical
architect
servandoni
was
commissioned
to
design
an
elaborate
entertainment
of
fireworks
on
a
colossal
scale
to
be
let
off
in
the
green
park
accompanied
by
the
music
of
handel
the
fireworks
music
was
scored
for
wind
instruments
a
rehearsal
of
it
without
fireworks
was
held
at
vauxhall
gardens
a
week
before
at
half
a
crown
admission
and
it
is
said
to
have
been
attended
by
a
crowd
of
twelve
thousand
persons
at
the
actual
performance
the
fireworks
were
a
disastrous
failure
owing
to
various
accidents
but
handel
music
accompanied
by
the
firing
of
ordnance
was
the
real
event
of
the
evening
a
month
later
handel
repeated
the
music
at
the
foundling
hospital
along
with
selections
from
solomon
and
a
new
work
composed
for
the
occasion
known
as
the
foundling
anthem
his
next
act
of
generosity
was
to
present
the
hospital
with
an
organ
which
he
inaugurated
on
may
with
a
performance
of
messiah
henceforth
the
performance
of
messiah
at
the
foundling
hospital
for
the
benefit
of
the
institution
became
an
annual
event
and
it
was
this
charitable
association
which
really
secured
the
work
its
subsequent
popularity
handel
next
oratorio
theodora
march
came
out
at
a
bad
moment
for
a
series
of
earthquakes
were
being
felt
in
london
with
the
result
that
many
people
took
refuge
in
the
country
and
those
who
stayed
behind
were
reluctant
to
go
to
the
theatre
the
blame
for
the
neglect
which
has
always
overtaken
theodora
has
been
very
unjustly
laid
on
morell
handel
himself
remembering
the
successes
of
judas
and
susanna
observed
to
the
poet
the
jews
will
not
come
to
it
because
it
is
a
christian
story
and
the
ladies
will
not
come
because
it
is
a
virtuous
one
theodora
was
always
handel
favourite
among
his
oratorios
and
he
considered
the
chorus
he
saw
the
lovely
youth
to
be
far
beyond
anything
in
messiah
none
the
less
the
theatre
was
half
empty
when
theodora
was
given
never
mind
said
handel
with
grim
humour
the
music
will
sound
all
the
better
an
old
acquaintance
reappeared
this
year
in
london
in
the
shape
of
cuzzoni
who
had
continued
her
quarrelsome
career
at
venice
vienna
and
stuttgart
an
unsuccessful
benefit
concert
was
given
for
her
at
which
giardini
the
violinist
made
his
first
appearance
in
london
handel
engaged
her
to
sing
in
messiah
at
the
foundling
hospital
but
her
voice
was
gone
she
was
arrested
for
debt
and
bailed
out
by
the
prince
of
wales
after
a
few
years
in
holland
where
she
was
again
in
prison
she
died
in
destitution
at
bologna
in
the
summer
handel
went
to
germany
for
the
last
time
nothing
is
known
of
his
movements
there
beyond
the
fact
that
on
the
journey
out
he
met
with
a
carriage
accident
between
the
hague
and
haarlem
he
was
seriously
injured
but
was
stated
in
a
london
paper
of
august
to
be
out
of
danger
nor
is
it
known
when
he
returned
we
have
no
further
news
of
him
until
in
january
he
began
work
on
jephtha
morell
says
that
he
himself
wrote
jephtha
in
but
as
handel
had
completed
the
first
act
on
february
it
is
probable
that
morell
like
jennens
supplied
him
with
the
words
in
instalments
the
composition
of
the
music
suffered
various
interruptions
owing
to
the
failure
of
handel
eyesight
and
possibly
to
a
return
of
mental
disorder
streatfeild
he
was
able
to
play
the
organ
at
the
foundling
hospital
in
may
and
directly
afterwards
went
for
a
short
visit
to
cheltenham
returning
to
london
on
june
he
resumed
work
on
jephtha
and
finished
it
on
august
it
was
some
time
this
year
the
precise
date
is
unknown
that
he
consulted
samuel
sharp
a
surgeon
of
guy
hospital
who
told
him
that
he
was
suffering
from
gutta
serena
and
that
freedom
from
pain
in
the
visual
organs
was
all
that
he
had
to
hope
for
during
the
remainder
of
his
days
it
was
a
severe
shock
especially
to
a
man
whose
general
physical
and
mental
health
was
already
undermined
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
handel
began
to
give
way
to
periods
of
profound
depression
the
condition
of
eyes
and
of
his
hand
as
well
may
be
clearly
observed
in
the
autograph
of
jephtha
and
it
may
be
noted
that
here
he
again
reverted
to
the
process
of
borrowing
this
time
from
five
masses
by
habermann
a
composer
twenty
years
his
junior
published
in
it
may
well
be
asked
how
handel
acquired
the
original
copies
of
all
the
works
which
he
utilised
in
his
later
years
since
it
is
obvious
that
they
could
not
have
been
well
known
or
easily
available
to
musicians
in
england
a
guess
may
be
hazarded
that
he
obtained
them
through
his
old
friend
telemann
at
hamburg
telemann
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
a
close
friend
of
handel
during
their
student
days
at
halle
whether
they
met
again
in
germany
after
handel
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
london
is
not
known
but
it
is
quite
probable
the
fact
remains
that
handel
was
undoubtedly
in
friendly
correspondence
with
telemann
in
for
in
december
of
that
year
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
him
in
french
thanking
him
for
a
theoretical
work
telemann
appears
to
have
been
a
keen
gardener
and
had
evidently
asked
handel
to
send
him
some
rare
plants
handel
reply
suggests
that
he
was
not
much
interested
in
gardening
himself
but
was
most
anxious
to
do
all
he
could
to
give
telemann
pleasure
another
letter
again
in
french
to
telemann
dated
september
explains
that
handel
had
set
about
procuring
the
plants
when
captain
carsten
of
hamburg
by
whose
ship
he
intended
to
send
them
told
him
that
telemann
was
dead
but
after
another
voyage
to
hamburg
and
back
carsten
brought
the
news
that
telemann
was
alive
and
in
good
health
he
also
brought
a
list
of
the
rare
plants
desired
and
handel
writes
to
say
that
he
has
obtained
almost
all
of
them
and
will
send
them
by
captain
carsten
when
he
sails
for
hamburg
again
in
december
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
mention
of
any
parcel
of
music
in
these
letters
beyond
telemann
system
of
intervals
but
they
suggest
that
they
were
part
of
a
longer
correspondence
telemann
was
keenly
interested
in
contemporary
music
as
his
correspondence
with
graun
shows
he
also
seems
to
have
asked
graun
to
send
him
plants
from
berlin
he
is
the
most
likely
person
to
have
sent
musical
works
of
interest
to
handel
possibly
they
were
sent
on
loan
and
returned
after
handel
had
made
the
extracts
which
are
to
be
seen
in
the
fitzwilliam
museum
at
cambridge
jephtha
was
produced
on
february
handel
oratorios
had
by
now
become
a
lucrative
undertaking
and
it
was
characteristic
of
english
audiences
that
they
came
in
crowds
to
see
handel
playing
the
organ
in
his
blindness
and
enjoy
the
luxury
of
tears
when
beard
sang
total
eclipse
sharp
the
oculist
recommended
handel
to
employ
as
his
assistant
john
stanley
who
had
been
blind
from
early
childhood
and
was
a
singularly
accomplished
organist
handel
burst
out
laughing
sharp
have
you
never
read
the
scriptures
do
you
not
remember
if
the
blind
lead
the
blind
they
both
fall
into
the
ditch
he
underwent
various
operations
but
derived
only
partial
benefit
from
them
during
these
last
years
he
led
a
very
retired
life
but
he
continued
to
play
the
organ
at
his
oratorios
at
first
from
memory
and
later
extemporising
the
solos
in
his
concertos
which
were
always
an
integral
feature
of
his
concerts
the
profits
of
these
were
enormous
and
when
he
died
in
he
left
investments
to
the
extent
of
composition
naturally
became
a
more
difficult
matter
after
blindness
set
in
but
new
songs
were
added
to
many
of
the
oratorios
and
in
he
made
a
complete
revision
of
his
old
italian
cantata
il
trionfo
del
tempo
morell
translated
it
into
english
and
seventeen
new
numbers
were
added
some
of
these
were
new
but
many
were
adapted
from
other
works
of
handel
chiefly
from
parnasso
in
festa
and
there
are
also
borrowings
from
lotti
and
graun
two
choruses
by
graun
had
already
been
utilised
in
the
revision
of
the
italian
version
which
handel
brought
out
in
all
this
time
john
christopher
schmidt
now
known
as
smith
had
been
his
indispensable
factotum
smith
made
fair
copies
of
his
music
and
managed
his
affairs
for
him
though
handel
almost
up
to
the
end
seems
to
have
discussed
his
investments
in
person
with
his
financial
adviser
gael
morris
in
the
city
smith
son
who
had
come
with
his
father
to
london
as
a
child
had
been
educated
under
handel
direction
and
in
became
the
first
organist
of
the
foundling
hospital
in
handel
later
years
it
was
the
son
who
assisted
him
at
the
performances
of
the
oratorios
and
acted
as
his
musical
amanuensis
there
is
a
curious
story
of
a
quarrel
which
took
place
at
tunbridge
wells
about
four
years
before
handel
death
between
the
two
old
men
the
cause
of
it
is
not
known
but
it
is
stated
to
have
been
quite
trivial
old
smith
left
handel
abruptly
and
handel
vowed
he
would
never
see
him
again
the
son
attempted
to
heal
the
breach
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
would
refuse
to
assist
handel
at
his
concerts
any
more
unless
handel
restored
to
his
father
the
legacy
which
after
the
quarrel
he
had
intended
to
leave
to
the
son
young
smith
foresaw
that
he
himself
would
be
accused
of
having
deliberately
alienated
the
affections
of
handel
from
his
father
in
order
to
secure
the
money
for
himself
handel
apparently
yielded
to
some
extent
but
it
is
clear
that
he
was
not
reconciled
to
old
smith
for
a
long
time
about
three
weeks
before
his
death
we
are
told
in
coxe
anecdotes
of
handel
and
smith
published
soon
after
young
smith
death
handel
desired
smith
junior
to
receive
the
sacrament
with
him
smith
asked
him
how
he
could
communicate
when
he
was
not
at
peace
with
the
world
and
especially
when
he
was
at
enmity
with
his
former
friend
who
though
he
might
have
offended
him
once
had
been
faithful
and
affectionate
to
him
for
thirty
years
handel
was
much
affected
by
smith
words
and
the
reconciliation
took
place
religion
had
gained
a
strong
hold
upon
handel
in
his
years
of
suffering
he
spoke
much
to
hawkins
and
others
of
his
delight
in
setting
the
scriptures
to
music
and
he
was
a
regular
worshipper
at
george
hanover
square
his
last
appearance
in
public
was
at
the
performance
of
messiah
on
april
but
at
the
end
of
it
he
was
seized
with
a
fainting
attack
took
to
his
bed
and
died
during
the
night
between
the
and
of
april
he
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
on
the
evening
of
the
the
choirs
of
the
chapel
royal
and
paul
joined
the
abbey
choir
in
singing
the
burial
music
of
croft
and
it
is
said
that
three
thousand
people
were
present
handel
will
executed
june
left
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
his
niece
and
goddaughter
johanna
friderica
floerken
nee
michaelsen
of
gotha
other
relatives
were
also
left
legacies
to
christopher
smith
junior
he
left
besides
his
large
harpsichord
his
chamber
organ
his
portrait
by
denner
and
his
manuscripts
he
had
at
one
time
thought
of
leaving
the
manuscripts
to
the
university
of
oxford
and
having
already
promised
them
to
smith
offered
him
a
legacy
of
if
he
would
resign
all
claim
to
them
smith
refused
and
also
refused
an
offer
of
made
for
them
after
handel
death
by
frederick
the
great
he
kept
them
until
when
he
presented
them
to
george
iii
in
return
for
a
pension
of
a
year
but
he
did
not
hand
over
the
whole
of
the
manuscripts
to
the
king
and
a
large
collection
of
rough
sketches
and
fragments
was
acquired
by
lord
fitzwilliam
who
bequeathed
them
to
the
university
of
cambridge
the
foregoing
pages
will
have
shown
how
singularly
few
are
the
definite
facts
about
handel
life
which
can
be
ascertained
with
any
degree
of
certainty
there
are
a
number
of
portraits
which
give
some
idea
of
his
outward
appearance
but
most
of
them
represent
him
as
a
man
of
middle
age
and
the
anecdotes
of
his
life
and
habits
recorded
by
various
contemporaries
belong
mostly
to
the
same
period
it
is
almost
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
his
private
character
and
his
inward
personality
biographers
of
musicians
often
attempt
to
deduce
their
characters
from
their
musical
works
but
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
such
a
procedure
is
thoroughly
unreliable
portraits
are
notoriously
unsafe
as
guides
to
the
interpretation
of
character
but
if
the
miniature
reproduced
by
mr
flower
as
having
been
painted
in
rome
is
an
authentic
likeness
of
handel
as
a
young
man
and
it
certainly
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
portrait
by
denner
painted
about
or
he
must
have
been
singularly
attractive
in
those
days
it
can
not
have
been
his
musical
abilities
alone
that
won
him
the
immediate
friendship
of
telemann
at
halle
and
mattheson
at
hamburg
and
although
he
seems
from
his
earliest
days
to
have
been
ambitious
and
determined
to
make
a
career
for
himself
his
contemporaries
give
the
impression
that
he
was
retiring
rather
than
in
later
life
he
was
often
described
as
bearish
and
but
this
can
not
have
been
the
case
in
his
youth
or
he
would
never
have
achieved
the
position
which
he
held
in
the
most
cultured
and
distinguished
society
of
rome
and
naples
his
visit
to
italy
must
inevitably
have
been
a
wonderful
education
in
the
humanities
otherwise
he
could
never
have
been
received
as
he
was
on
his
first
visit
to
london
by
the
society
which
most
nearly
resembled
that
of
his
italian
friends
and
patrons
professional
musicians
and
especially
those
connected
with
the
theatre
were
regarded
in
england
as
being
more
or
less
disreputable
unless
they
held
university
degrees
and
posts
of
distinction
handel
moved
among
them
in
his
professional
life
as
was
only
natural
but
his
more
intimate
friendships
seem
throughout
his
career
to
have
been
confined
mainly
to
the
innermost
circle
of
the
amateurs
we
must
not
forget
however
that
it
was
only
persons
of
that
class
whose
letters
and
memoirs
have
come
down
to
us
burney
and
hawkins
at
any
rate
were
well
acquainted
with
the
professional
world
and
their
testimony
tends
to
confirm
that
handel
stood
more
or
less
aloof
from
it
it
was
only
in
later
life
that
he
associated
on
terms
of
friendship
with
such
a
person
as
cibber
the
singer
in
an
age
when
all
were
with
some
truth
regarded
as
centres
of
sexual
promiscuity
it
is
indeed
remarkable
that
not
the
least
evidence
exists
with
one
solitary
exception
that
handel
was
ever
even
alleged
to
have
had
an
illicit
mr
flower
discovered
a
copy
of
mainwaring
biography
with
marginal
notes
said
to
be
in
the
handwriting
of
george
iii
and
there
we
read
handel
was
ever
honest
nay
excessively
polite
but
like
all
men
of
sense
would
talk
all
and
hear
none
and
scorned
the
advice
of
any
but
the
woman
he
loved
but
his
amours
were
rather
of
short
duration
always
within
the
pale
of
his
own
profession
the
of
handel
and
mention
two
occasions
on
which
he
was
said
to
have
become
engaged
to
be
married
or
nearly
so
but
the
writer
is
so
reticent
that
little
faith
can
be
placed
in
his
statement
and
in
any
case
the
published
in
are
not
very
reliable
as
far
as
handel
is
concerned
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
that
there
were
two
handels
one
excessively
polite
which
in
the
language
of
the
eighteenth
century
does
not
mean
that
he
was
servile
and
cringing
but
simply
that
he
behaved
like
a
man
of
good
breeding
as
he
appeared
to
such
people
as
delany
and
the
harris
family
and
the
other
as
he
showed
himself
at
rehearsals
or
in
the
society
of
men
friends
of
more
or
less
his
own
standing
bluntly
outspoken
and
perhaps
at
times
inconsiderate
the
hostility
of
a
large
number
of
social
leaders
may
well
have
been
aroused
in
the
first
instance
by
some
careless
harsh
word
the
figure
of
handel
was
large
says
burney
and
he
was
somewhat
corpulent
and
unwieldy
in
his
motions
but
his
countenance
which
i
remember
as
perfectly
as
that
of
any
man
i
saw
but
yesterday
was
full
of
fire
and
dignity
and
such
as
impressed
ideas
of
superiority
and
genius
he
was
impetuous
rough
and
peremptory
in
his
manners
and
conversation
but
totally
devoid
of
or
malevolence
indeed
there
was
an
original
humour
and
pleasantry
in
his
most
lively
sallies
of
anger
or
impatience
which
with
his
broken
english
were
extremely
risible
his
natural
propensity
to
wit
and
humour
and
happy
manner
of
relating
common
occurrences
in
an
uncommon
way
enabled
him
to
throw
persons
and
things
into
very
ridiculous
attitudes
handel
general
look
was
somewhat
heavy
and
sour
but
when
he
did
smile
it
was
his
sire
the
sun
bursting
out
of
a
black
cloud
there
was
a
sudden
flash
of
intelligence
wit
and
good
humour
beaming
in
his
countenance
which
i
hardly
ever
saw
in
any
other
both
burney
and
hawkins
record
that
outside
his
profession
he
was
said
to
be
ignorant
and
dull
and
the
fact
that
they
are
at
pains
to
defend
him
on
this
charge
shows
that
there
was
apparent
ground
for
it
pepusch
said
of
him
that
he
was
a
good
practical
musician
which
is
what
one
might
well
expect
of
pepusch
whose
devotion
to
antiquarian
learning
aroused
the
amusement
rather
than
the
admiration
of
his
contemporaries
handel
was
at
any
rate
keenly
interested
in
painting
like
corelli
and
the
third
codicil
to
his
will
dated
august
mentions
two
landscapes
by
rembrandt
one
a
view
of
the
rhine
which
he
bequeathed
to
one
of
the
granvilles
from
whom
he
had
received
both
as
a
gift
another
characteristic
of
handel
for
which
his
early
biographers
are
hard
put
to
find
an
excuse
was
his
enormous
appetite
for
food
and
drink
satirised
by
his
once
intimate
friend
the
painter
goupy
in
a
print
called
the
charming
brute
in
which
handel
is
represented
with
the
head
of
a
pig
seated
at
an
organ
with
various
comestibles
disposed
at
his
feet
in
this
connexion
it
may
be
noted
that
for
all
his
gluttony
handel
was
never
accused
of
drunkenness
if
he
exceeded
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
it
was
as
a
gourmet
and
a
connoisseur
yet
it
is
recorded
that
he
never
led
an
extravagant
life
and
apart
from
this
particular
weakness
he
lived
as
simply
in
the
days
of
his
wealth
as
in
those
of
his
poverty
generosity
to
those
in
distress
was
at
all
times
characteristic
of
him
although
handel
became
a
naturalised
british
subject
none
of
his
contemporaries
would
ever
have
dreamed
of
regarding
him
as
an
englishman
or
as
a
composer
of
english
music
burney
account
of
the
commemoration
festival
of
may
be
regarded
as
an
official
panegyric
but
even
in
that
he
goes
no
further
than
to
say
that
handel
though
not
a
native
of
england
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
life
in
the
service
of
its
inhabitants
improving
our
taste
and
introducing
among
us
so
many
species
of
musical
excellence
that
during
more
than
half
a
century
while
sentiment
not
fashion
guided
our
applause
we
neither
wanted
nor
wished
for
any
other
standard
indeed
his
works
were
so
long
the
models
of
perfection
in
this
country
that
they
may
be
said
to
have
formed
our
national
taste
in
the
pages
which
deal
with
the
character
of
handel
as
a
composer
he
says
that
he
united
the
depth
and
elaborate
contrivance
of
his
own
country
with
italian
elegance
and
facility
handel
music
he
holds
was
from
the
first
congenial
to
the
english
temperament
but
he
never
regards
it
as
being
at
all
english
in
style
though
in
other
writings
he
naturally
recognises
the
occasional
indebtedness
of
handel
to
the
influence
of
purcell
it
was
only
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
handel
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
national
institution
his
own
country
for
the
most
part
neglected
his
works
his
operas
were
thought
impossible
to
revive
and
the
oratorios
were
considered
by
most
germans
as
being
too
english
an
opinion
which
the
writer
of
this
book
frequently
heard
expressed
in
germany
some
fifty
years
ago
since
there
has
been
an
astonishing
revival
of
handel
in
germany
beginning
with
the
restoration
to
the
stage
of
his
operas
the
last
works
of
his
which
most
people
would
have
thought
suitable
for
presentation
to
modern
audiences
and
much
energy
has
been
expended
by
german
critics
on
an
attempt
to
demonstrate
the
essentially
germanic
character
both
of
handel
music
and
of
his
personality
the
more
closely
we
study
handel
in
relation
to
his
own
times
and
in
relation
to
the
general
history
of
music
the
clearer
it
becomes
that
goupy
the
caricaturist
was
only
right
when
he
put
into
handel
mouth
the
words
i
am
myself
alone
the
foundation
of
handel
musical
style
was
italian
and
it
was
only
natural
that
this
should
be
the
case
for
in
his
days
italy
dominated
european
music
as
she
did
european
architecture
all
music
in
the
grand
manner
except
in
france
was
italian
in
its
tradition
and
if
ever
there
was
a
composer
who
illustrated
the
grand
manner
throughout
his
life
it
was
handel
france
had
produced
a
grand
manner
of
her
own
though
not
without
an
initial
impulse
from
italy
in
all
other
countries
north
of
the
alps
native
music
was
only
for
the
humbler
classes
of
society
when
handel
condescended
to
it
as
he
did
in
the
political
excitement
of
he
deliberately
adopted
the
musical
style
of
a
tavern
song
handel
serious
music
was
never
written
for
popular
audiences
in
his
later
oratorios
he
sometimes
admittedly
wrote
down
to
the
taste
of
the
middle
classes
but
we
have
the
records
of
his
conversations
with
gluck
hawkins
and
others
to
prove
how
little
respect
he
had
for
that
taste
he
composed
for
the
needs
of
the
moment
and
not
with
a
view
to
immortality
but
he
composed
for
a
society
which
was
cultured
enough
to
desire
even
in
its
entertainments
grace
dignity
and
serenity
if
handel
works
have
for
later
generations
become
a
source
of
joy
and
delight
to
a
very
different
social
class
it
is
because
they
are
the
musical
equivalents
of
those
palaces
and
gardens
of
handel
day
which
are
now
national
monuments
and
open
to
all
comers
we
walk
beneath
their
colonnades
peopling
them
in
imagination
with
the
gracious
and
stately
figures
of
the
past
and
from
the
museum
of
memory
there
arise
the
unheard
strains
of
handel
music
the
heavenly
sphere
turns
round
and
silence
now
is
drown
in
ecstasy
of
sound
how
on
a
sudden
the
still
air
is
charm
as
if
all
harmony

just
