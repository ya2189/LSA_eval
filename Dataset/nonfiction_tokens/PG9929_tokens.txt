charles

it
is
related
that
in
on
the
day
following
the
death
of
the
great
cardinal
mazarin
the
various
officials
of
the
state
approached
their
young
king
louis
xiv
to
whom
shall
we
go
now
for
orders
your
majesty
to
me
answered
louis
and
from
that
date
until
his
death
in
they
had
no
other
master
whether
we
accept
the
tale
as
literal
fact
or
only
as
the
vivid
french
way
of
visualizing
a
truth
we
find
here
the
central
point
of
over
fifty
years
of
european
history
the
two
celebrated
cardinals
richelieu
and
mazarin
had
by
their
strength
and
wisdom
made
france
by
far
the
most
powerful
state
in
europe
moreover
they
had
so
reduced
the
authority
of
the
french
nobility
the
clergy
and
the
courts
of
law
as
to
have
become
practically
absolute
and
untrammelled
in
their
control
of
the
entire
government
now
all
this
enormous
power
both
at
home
and
abroad
over
france
and
over
europe
was
assumed
by
a
young
man
of
i
am
the
state
said
louis
at
a
later
period
of
his
career
he
might
almost
have
said
i
am
europe
looking
as
he
did
only
to
the
europe
that
dominated
and
took
pleasure
in
itself
and
made
life
one
continued
glittering
revel
of
splendor
independent
europe
that
claimed
the
right
of
thinking
for
itself
the
suffering
europe
of
the
peasants
who
starved
and
shed
their
blood
in
helpless
agony
these
were
against
louis
almost
from
the
beginning
and
ever
increasingly
against
him
at
first
the
young
monarch
found
life
very
bright
around
him
his
courtiers
called
him
the
rising
sun
and
his
ambition
was
to
justify
the
title
to
be
what
with
his
enormous
wealth
and
authority
was
scarcely
difficult
the
grand
monarch
he
rushed
into
causeless
war
and
snatched
provinces
from
his
feeble
neighbors
exhausted
germany
and
decaying
spain
he
built
huge
fortresses
along
his
frontiers
and
military
roads
from
end
to
end
of
his
domains
his
court
was
one
continuous
round
of
splendid
entertainments
he
encouraged
literature
or
at
least
pensioned
authors
and
had
them
clustered
around
him
in
what
frenchmen
call
the
augustan
age
of
their
development

the
little
german
princes
of
the

each
of
them
practically
independent
ruler
of
a
tiny
state
could
not
of
course
compete
with
louis
or
defy
him
nor
for
a
time
did
they
attempt
it
his
splendor
dazzled
them
they
were
content
to
imitate
and
each
little
prince
became
a
patron
of
literature
or
giver
of
entertainments
or
builder
of
huge
fortresses
absurdly
disproportioned
to
his
territory
and
his

germany
it
has
been
aptly
said
became
a
mere
tail
to
the
french
kite
its
leaders
feebly
draggling
after
where
louis
soared
never
had
the
common
people
of
europe
or
even
the
nobility
had
less
voice
in
their
own
affairs
it
was
an
age
of
absolute
kingly
power
an
age
of
despotism
england
which
under
cromwell
had
bid
fair
to
take
a
foremost
place
in
europe
sank
under
charles
ii
into
unimportance
its
people
wearied
with
tumult
desired
peace
more
than
aught
else
its
king
experienced
in
adversity
and
long
a
homeless
wanderer
in
france
and
holland
seemed
to
have
but
one
firm
principle
in
life
whatever
happened
he
did
not
intend
as
he
himself
phrased
it
to
go
on
his
travels
again
he
dreaded
and
hated
the
english
parliament
as
all
the
stuarts
had
and
like
his
father
he
avoided
calling
it
together
to
obtain
money
without
its
aid
he
accepted
a
pension
from
the
french
king
thus
england
also
became
a
servitor
of
louis
its
policy
so
far
as
charles
could
mould
it
was
france
policy
if
we
look
for
events
in
the
english
history
of
the
time
we
must
find
them
in
internal
incidents
the
terrible
plague
that
devastated
london
in
the
fire
of
the
following
year
that
checked
the
plague
but
almost
swept
the
city
out
of
existence
we
must
note
the
founding
of
the
royal
society
in
for
the
advancement
of
science
or
look
to
newton

ably
the
combined
assaults
of
the
french
and

but
the
french
armies
overran
almost
her

was
then
that
her
people
talked
of
entering
their
ships
and
sailing
away
together
transporting
their
nation
bodily
to
some
colony
beyond
louis
reach
it
was
then
that
amsterdam
set

dykes

to
whose
pride
and
incompetence
wholly
prevented
him
from

would
naturally
have
made
him
the
leader
of
the
opposition

centre
around

all

leopold
hated

brandenburger
he
hated
the
merchant
dutch
hated
everybody
in
short
who
dared
intrude
upon
the
ancient
order
of

who
refused

the
earlier
career
of
louis
xiv
seems
to
have
been
mainly
influenced
by
his
passion
for
personal
renown
but
he
had
always
been
a
serious
catholic
and
in
his
later
life
his
interest
in
religion
became
a
most
important
factor
in
his
world
the
protestants
of
france
had
for
wellnigh
a
century
held
their
faith
unmolested
safeguarded
by
that
edict
of
nantes
which
had
been
granted
by
henry
iv
a
catholic
at
least
in
name
and
confirmed
by
cardinal
richelieu
a
catholic
by
profession
persuasive
measures
had
indeed
been
frequently
employed
to
win
the
deserters
back
to
the
ancient
church
but
now
under
louis
direction
a
harsher
course
was
attempted
the
celebrated
dragonades
quartered
a
wild
and
licentious
soldiery
in
protestant
localities
in
the
homes
of
protestant
with
special
orders
to
make
themselves
offensive
to
their
hosts
under
this
grim
discouragement
protestantism
seemed
dying
out
of
france
and
at
last
in
louis
encouraged
by
success
took
the
final
step
and
revoked
the
edict
of
nantes
commanding
all
his
subjects
to
accept
catholicism
while
at
the

time
forbidding
any

despite

accession

against

in
the

year
that
protestant
europe
was
thus
assailed
and
terrified
by
the
reviving
spectre
of
religious
persecution
charles

succeeded
him
charles
may
have
been
catholic
at

one
king

many
of

secretly
to
william

for
help
william
was
as
we
have
said
the
centre
of
opposition
to
louis
and
that
began
to
mean
to
catholicism
as
well
also
william
had
married
a
daughter
of

james

had
thus
some
claim
to
interfere
in
the

little

was
so
widespread
that
despite

england
had
only
a

feeble

william

they
had

by
making

must
puff
out
with

who
should
succeed
him
in

had
schemed
that
the
prize
should
go

had
wedded

louis

the

hapsburgs

men
grew

and
died
while
the

charles

louis

one

assumption

of
the
old
monarchy
of
france
the
type
of
polity
which
that
monarchy
embodied
the
principles
of
government
on
which
it
reposed
or
brought
into
play
in
this
reign
attain
their
supreme
expression
and
development
before
louis
xiv
the
french
monarchy
has
evidently
not
attained
its
full
stature
it
is
thwarted
and
limited
by
other
forces
in
the
state
after
him
though
unresisted
from
without
it
manifests
symptoms
of
decay
from
within
it
rapidly
declines
and
totally
disappears
years
after
his
death
but
it
is
not
only
the
most
conspicuous
reign
in
the
history
of
france
it
is
the
most
conspicuous
reign
in
the
history
of
monarchy
in
general
of
the
very
many
kings
whom
history
mentions
who
have
striven
to
exalt
the
monarchical
principle
none
of
them
achieved
a
success
remotely
comparable
to
his
his
two
great
predecessors
in
kingly
ambition
charles
v
and
philip
ii
remained
far
behind
him
in
this
respect
they
may
have
ruled
over
wider
dominions
but
they
never
attained
the
exceptional
position
of
power
and
prestige
which
he
enjoyed
for
more
than
half
a
century
they
never
were
obeyed
so
submissively
at
home
nor
so
dreaded
and
even
respected
abroad
for
louis
xiv
carried
off
that
last
reward
of
complete
success
that
he
for
a
time
silenced
even
envy
and
turned
it
into
admiration
we
who
can
examine
with
cold
scrutiny
the
make
and
composition
of
this
colossus
of
a
french
monarchy
who
can
perceive
how
much
the
brass
and
clay
in
it
exceeded
the
gold
who
know
how
it
afterward
fell
with
a
resounding
ruin
the
last
echoes
of
which
have
scarcely
died
away
have
difficulty
in
realizing
the
fascination
it
exercised
upon
contemporaries
who
witnessed
its
first
setting
up
louis
xiv
reign
was
the
very
triumph
of
commonplace
greatness
of
external
magnificence
and
success
such
as
the
vulgar
among
mankind
can
best
and
most
sincerely
appreciate
had
he
been
a
great
and
profound
ruler
had
he
considered
with
unselfish
meditation
the
real
interests
of
france
had
he
with
wise
insight
discerned
and
followed
the
remote
lines
of
progress
along
which
the
future
of
europe
was
destined
to
move
it
is
lamentably
probable
that
he
would
have
been
misunderstood
in
his
lifetime
and
calumniated
after
his
death
louis
xiv
was
exposed
to
no
such
misconception
his
qualities
were
on
the
surface
visible
and
comprehensible
to
all
and
although
none
of
them
was
brilliant
he
had
several
which
have
a
peculiarly
impressive
effect
when
displayed
in
an
exalted
station
he
was
indefatigably
industrious
worked
on
an
average
eight
hours
a
day
for
years
had
great
tenacity
of
will
that
kind
of
solid
judgment
which
comes
of
slowness
of
brain
and
withal
a
most
majestic
port
and
great
dignity
of
manners
he
had
also
as
much
kindliness
of
nature
as
the
very
great
can
be
expected
to
have
his
temper
was
under
severe
control
and
in
his
earlier
years
at
least
he
had
a
moral
apprehensiveness
greater
than
the
limitations
of
his
intellect
would
have
led
one
to
expect
his
conduct
toward
molière
was
throughout
truly
noble
and
the
more
so
that
he
never
intellectually
appreciated
molière
real
greatness
but
he
must
have
had
great
original
fineness
of
tact
though
it
was
in
the
end
nearly
extinguished
by
adulation
and
incense
his
court
was
an
extraordinary
creation
and
the
greatest
thing
he
achieved
he
made
it
the
microcosm
of
all
that
was
the
most
brilliant
and
prominent
in
france
every
order
of
merit
was
invited
there
and
received
courteous
welcome
to
no
circumstance
did
he
so
much
owe
his
enduring
popularity
by
its
means
he
impressed
into
his
service
that
galaxy
of
great
writers
the
first
and
the
last
classic
authors
of
france
whose
calm
and
serene
lustre
will
forever
illumine
the
epoch
of
his
existence
it
may
even
be
admitted
that
his
share
in
that
lustre
was
not
so
accidental
and
undeserved
as
certain
have
supposed
that
subtle
critic
thinks
he
can
trace
a
marked
rise
even
in
bossuet
style
from
the
moment
he
became
a
courtier
of
louis
xiv
the
king
brought
men
together
placed
them
in
a
position
where
they
were
induced
and
urged
to
bring
their
talents
to
a
focus
his
court
was
alternately
a
gala
and
a
stately
university
if
we
contrast
his
life
with
those
of
his
predecessor
and
successor
with
the
dreary
existence
of
louis
xiii
and
the
crapulous
lifelong
debauch
of
louis
xv
we
become
sensible
that
louis
xiv
was
distinguished
in
no
common
degree
and
when
we
further
reflect
that
much
of
his
home
and
all
of
his
foreign
policy
was
precisely
adapted
to
flatter
in
its
deepest
the
national
spirit
of
france
it
will
not
be
quite
impossible
to
understand
the
reverberation
of
his
fame
but
louis
xiv
reign
has
better
titles
than
the
adulations
of
courtiers
and
the
eulogies
of
wits
and
poets
to
the
attention
of
posterity
it
marks
one
of
the
most
memorable
epochs
in
the
annals
of
mankind
it
stretches
across
history
like
a
great
mountain
range
separating
ancient
france
from
the
france
of
modern
times
on
the
further
slope
are
catholicism
and
feudalism
in
their
various
stages
of
splendor
and
decay
the
france
of
crusade
and
chivalry
of
louis
and
bayard
on
the
hither
side
are
freethought
industry
and
centralization
the
france
of
voltaire
turgot
and
condorcet
when
louis
came
to
the
throne
the
thirty
years
war
still
wanted
six
years
of
its
end
and
the
heat
of
theological
strife
was
at
its
intensest
glow
when
he
died
the
religious
temperature
had
cooled
nearly
to
and
a
new
vegetation
of
science
and
positive
inquiry
was
overspreading
the
world
this
amounts
to
saying
that
his
reign
covers
the
greatest
epoch
of
mental
transition
through
which
the
human
mind
has
hitherto
passed
excepting
the
transition
we
are
witnessing
in
the
day
which
now
is
we
need
but
recall
the
names
of
the
writers
and
thinkers
who
arose
during
louis
xiv
reign
and
shed
their
seminal
ideas
broadcast
upon
the
air
to
realize
how
full
a
period
it
was
both
of
birth
and
decay
of
the
passing
away
of
the
old
and
the
uprising
of
the
new
forms
of
thought
to
mention
only
the
greatest
the
following
are
among
the
chiefs
who
helped
to
transform
the
mental
fabric
of
europe
in
the
age
of
louis
xiv
descartes
newton
leibnitz
locke
boyle
under
these
leaders
the
first
firm
irreversible
advance
was
made
out
of
the
dim
twilight
of
theology
into
the
clear
dawn
of
positive
and
demonstrative
science
inferior
to
these
founders
of
modern
knowledge
but
holding
a
high
rank
as
contributors
to
the
mental
activity
of
the
age
were
pascal
malebranche
spinoza
and
bayle
the
result
of
their
efforts
was
such
a
stride
forward
as
has
no
parallel
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
one
of
the
most
curious
and
significant
proofs
of
it
was
the
spontaneous
extinction
of
the
belief
in
witchcraft
among
the
cultivated
classes
of
europe
as
the
english
historian
of
rationalism
has
so
judiciously
pointed
out
the
superstition
was
not
much
attacked
and
it
was
vigorously
defended
yet
it
died
a
natural
and
quiet
death
from
the
changed
moral
climate
of
the
world
but
the
chief
interest
which
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
offers
to
the
student
of
history
has
yet
to
be
mentioned
it
was
the
great
in
the
history
of
the
french
people
the
triumph
of
the
monarchical
principle
was
so
complete
under
him
independence
and
were
so
effectually
crushed
both
in
localities
and
individuals
that
a
permanent
bent
was
given
to
the
national
mind
a
habit
of
looking
to
the
government
for
all
action
and
initiative
permanently
established
before
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
it
was
a
question
which
might
fairly
be
considered
undecided
whether
the
country
would
be
able
or
not
willing
or
not
to
coöperate
with
its
rulers
in
the
work
of
the
government
and
the
reform
of
abuses
on
more
than
one
occasion
such
coöperation
did
not
seem
entirely
impossible
or
improbable
the
admirable
wisdom
and
moderation
shown
by
the
in
the
of
the
divers
efforts
of
the
parliament
of
paris
to
check
extravagant
expenditure
the
vigorous
struggles
of
the
provincial
assemblies
to
preserve
some
relic
of
their
local
liberties
seemed
to
promise
that
france
would
continue
to
advance
under
the
leadership
indeed
of
the
monarchy
yet
still
retaining
in
large
measure
the
bright
free
independent
spirit
of
old
gaul
the
gaul
of
rabelais
montaigne
and
joinville
after
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
such
coöperation
of
the
ruler
and
the
ruled
became
impossible
the
government
of
france
had
become
a
machine
depending
upon
the
action
of
a
single
spring
spontaneity
in
the
population
at
large
was
extinct
and
whatever
there
was
to
do
must
be
done
by
the
central
authority
as
long
as
the
government
could
correct
abuses
it
was
well
if
it
ceased
to
be
equal
to
this
task
they
must
go
uncorrected
when
at
last
the
reform
of
secular
and
gigantic
abuses
presented
itself
with
imperious
urgency
the
alternative
before
the
monarchy
was
either
to
carry
the
reform
with
a
high
hand
or
perish
in
the
failure
to
do
so
we
know
how
signal
the
failure
was
and
could
not
help
being
under
the
circumstances
and
through
having
placed
the
monarchy
between
these
alternatives
it
is
no
paradox
to
say
that
louis
xiv
was
one
of
the
most
direct
ancestors
of
the
great
revolution
nothing
but
special
conditions
in
the
politics
both
of
europe
and
of
france
can
explain
this
singular
importance
and
prominence
of
louis
xiv
reign
and
we
find
that
both
france
and
europe
were
indeed
in
an
exceptional
position
when
he
ascended
the
throne
the
continent
of
europe
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
still
bleeding
and
prostrate
from
the
effect
of
the
thirty
years
war
when
the
young
louis
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
his
age
was
anointed
king
at
rheims
although
france
had
suffered
terribly
in
that
awful
struggle
she
had
probably
suffered
less
than
any
of
the
combatants
unless
it
be
sweden
it
happened
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
precisely
at
this
moment
when
the
condition
of
europe
was
such
that
an
aggressive
policy
on
the
part
of
france
could
be
only
with
difficulty
resisted
by
her
neighbors
the
power
and
prerogatives
of
the
french
crown
attained
an
expansion
and
preeminence
which
they
had
never
enjoyed
in
the
previous
history
of
the
country
the
schemes
and
hopes
of
philip
the
fair
of
louis
xi
of
henry
iv
and
of
richelieu
had
been
realized
at
last
and
their
efforts
to
throw
off
the
insolent
coercion
of
the
great
feudal
lords
had
been
crowned
with
complete
success
the
monarchy
could
hardly
have
conjectured
how
strong
it
had
become
but
for
the
abortive
resistance
and
hostility
it
met
with
in
the
fronde
the
flames
of
insurrection
which
had
shot
up
forked
and
menacing
fell
back
underground
where
they
smouldered
for
four
generations
yet
to
come
the
kingly
power
soared
single
and
supreme
over
its
prostrate
foes
long
before
louis
xiv
had
shown
any
aptitude
or
disposition
for
authority
he
was
the
object
of
adulation
as
cringing
as
was
ever
offered
to
a
roman
emperor
when
he
returned
from
his
consecration
at
rheims
the
rector
of
the
university
of
paris
at
the
head
of
his
professorial
staff
addressed
the
young
king
in
these
words
we
are
so
dazzled
by
the
new
splendor
which
surrounds
your
majesty
that
we
are
not
ashamed
to
appear
dumfounded
at
the
aspect
of
a
light
so
brilliant
and
so
extraordinary
and
at
the
foot
of
an
engraving
at
the
same
date
he
is
in
so
many
words
called
a
demigod
it
is
evident
that
ample
materials
had
been
prepared
for
what
the
vulgar
consider
a
great
reign
abundant
opportunity
for
an
insolent
and
aggressive
foreign
policy
owing
to
the
condition
of
europe
security
from
remonstrance
or
check
at
home
owing
to
the
condition
of
france
the
temple
is
prepared
for
the
deity
the
priests
stand
by
ready
to
offer
victims
on
the
smoking
altar
the
incense
is
burning
in
anticipation
of
his
advent
on
the
death
of
mazarin
in
he
entered
into
his
own
louis
xiv
never
forgot
the
trials
and
humiliations
to
which
he
and
his
mother
had
been
subjected
during
the
troubles
of
the
fronde
it
has
often
been
remarked
that
rulers
born
in
the
purple
have
seldom
shown
much
efficiency
unless
they
have
been
exposed
to
exceptional
and
as
it
were
artificial
probations
during
their
youth
during
the
first
eleven
years
of
louis
reign
incomparably
the
most
creditable
to
him
we
can
trace
unmistakably
the
influence
of
the
wisdom
and
experience
acquired
in
that
period
of
anxiety
and
defeat
he
then
learned
the
value
of
money
and
the
supreme
benefits
of
a
full
exchequer
he
also
acquired
a
thorough
dread
of
subjection
to
ministers
and
favorites
a
dread
so
deep
that
it
implied
a
consciousness
of
probable
weakness
on
that
side
as
he
went
on
in
life
he
to
a
great
extent
forgot
both
these
valuable
lessons
but
their
influence
was
never
entirely
effaced
to
the
astonishment
of
the
courtiers
and
even
of
his
mother
he
announced
his
intention
of
governing
independently
and
of
looking
after
everything
himself
they
openly
doubted
his
perseverance
you
do
not
know
him
said
mazarin
he
will
begin
rather
late
but
he
will
go
further
than
most
there
is
enough
stuff
in
him
to
make
four
kings
and
an
honest
man
besides
his
first
measures
were
dictated
less
by
great
energy
of
initiative
than
by
absolute
necessity
the
finances
had
fallen
into
such
a
chaos
of
jobbery
and
confusion
that
the
very
existence
of
the
government
depended
upon
a
prompt
and
trenchant
reform
it
was
louis
rare
to
find
beside
him
one
of
the
most
able
and
vigorous
administrators
who
have
ever
lived
colbert
he
had
the
merit
not
a
small
one
in
that
age
of
letting
this
great
minister
invent
and
carry
out
the
most
daring
and
beneficial
measures
of
reform
of
which
he
assumed
all
the
credit
to
himself
the
first
step
was
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
gang
of
financial
plunderers
who
with
fouquet
at
their
head
simply
embezzled
the
bulk
of
the
state
revenues
the
not
only
obtained
the
most
usurious
interest
for
their
loans
but
actually
held
in
mortgage
the
most
productive
sources
of
the
national
taxation
and
not
content
with
that
they
bought
up
at
per
cent
of
their
nominal
value
an
enormous
amount
of
discredited
bills
issued
by
the
government
in
the
time
of
the
fronde
which
they
forced
the
treasury
to
pay
off
at
par
and
this
was
done
with
the
very
money
they
had
just
before
advanced
to
the
government
such
barefaced
plunder
could
not
be
endured
and
colbert
was
the
last
man
to
endure
it
he
not
only
repressed
peculation
but
introduced
a
number
of
practical
improvements
in
the
distribution
and
especially
in
the
mode
of
levying
the
taxes
so
imperfect
were
the
arrangements
connected
with
the
latter
that
it
was
estimated
that
of
millions
paid
by
the
people
only
millions
entered
into
the
coffers
of
the
state
the
almost
instantaneous
effects
of
colbert
measures
the
yawning
deficit
was
changed
into
a
surplus
of
millions
in
less
than
two
years
showed
how
gross
and
flagrant
had
been
the
malversation
preceding
far
more
difficult
and
far
nobler
in
the
order
of
constructive
statesmanship
were
his
vast
schemes
to
endow
france
with
manufactures
with
a
commercial
and
belligerent
navy
with
colonies
besides
his
manifold
reforms
in
the
internal
administration
tariffs
and
customs
between
neighboring
provinces
of
france
the
great
work
of
the
languedoc
canal
in
fact
in
every
part
and
province
of
government
his
success
was
various
but
in
some
cases
really
stupendous
his
creation
of
a
navy
almost
surpasses
belief
in
when
he
first
became
free
to
act
france
possessed
only
thirty
of
all
sizes
at
the
peace
of
nimwegen
in
she
had
acquired
a
fleet
of
one
hundred
twenty
ships
and
in
she
had
got
a
fleet
of
one
hundred
vessels
and
the
increase
was
quite
as
great
in
the
size
and
armament
of
the
individual
ships
as
in
their
number
a
perfect
giant
of
administration
colbert
found
no
labor
too
great
for
his
energies
and
worked
with
unflagging
energy
sixteen
hours
a
day
for
years
it
is
melancholy
to
be
forced
to
add
that
all
this
toil
was
as
good
as
thrown
away
and
that
the
strong
man
went
to
the
grave
through
seeing
too
clearly
that
he
had
labored
in
vain
for
an
ungrateful
egotist
his
great
visions
of
a
prosperous
france
increasing
in
wealth
and
contentment
were
blighted
and
he
closed
his
eyes
upon
scenes
of
improvidence
and
waste
more
injurious
to
the
country
than
the
financial
robbery
which
he
had
combated
in
his
early
days
the
government
was
not
plundered
as
it
had
been
but
itself
was
exhausting
the
very
springs
of
wealth
by
its
impoverishment
of
the
people
boisguillebert
writing
in
only
fifteen
years
after
colbert
death
estimated
the
productive
powers
of
france
to
have
diminished
by
in
the
previous
thirty
years
it
seems
indeed
probable
that
the
almost
magical
rapidity
and
effect
of
colbert
early
reforms
turned
louis
head
and
that
he
was
convinced
that
it
only
depended
on
his
good
pleasure
to
renew
them
to
obtain
the
same
result
he
never
found
as
he
never
deserved
to
find
another
colbert
and
he
stumbled
onward
in
ever
deeper
ruin
to
his
disastrous
end
his
first
breach
of
public
faith
was
his
attack
on
the
spanish
netherlands
under
color
of
certain
pretended
rights
of
the
queen
his
wife
the
infanta
marie
thérèse
although
he
had
renounced
all
claims
in
her
name
at
his
marriage
this
aggression
was
followed
by
his
famous
campaign
in
the
low
countries
when
was
overrun
and
conquered
in
fifteen
days
he
was
stopped
by
the
celebrated
triple
alliance
in
mid
career
he
had
not
yet
been
intoxicated
by
success
and
vanity
colbert
influence
always
exerted
on
the
side
of
peace
was
at
its
height
the
menacing
attitude
of
holland
england
and
sweden
awed
him
and
he
drew
back
his
pride
was
deeply
wounded
and
he
revolved
deep
and
savage
schemes
of
revenge
not
on
england
whose
abject
sovereign
he
knew
could
be
had
whenever
he
chose
to
buy
him
but
on
the
heroic
little
republic
which
had
dared
to
cross
his
victorious
path
his
mingled
contempt
and
rage
against
holland
were
indeed
instinctive
spontaneous
and
in
the
nature
of
things
holland
was
the
living
triumphant
incarnation
of
the
two
things
he
hated
most
the
principle
of
liberty
in
politics
and
the
principle
of
free
inquiry
in
religion
with
a
passion
too
deep
for
hurry
or
carelessness
he
made
his
preparations
the
army
was
submitted
to
a
complete
reorganization
a
change
in
the
weapons
of
the
infantry
was
effected
which
was
as
momentous
in
its
day
as
the
introduction
of
the
rifle
in
ours
the
old
inefficient
firelock
was
replaced
by
the
flint
musket
and
the
rapidity
and
certainty
of
fire
vastly
increased
the
undisciplined
independence
of
the
officers
commanding
regiments
and
companies
was
suppressed
by
the
rigorous
and
methodical
colonel
martinet
whose
name
has
remained
in
other
armies
besides
that
of
france
as
a
synonyme
of
punctilious
exactitude
the
means
of
offence
being
thus
secured
the
next
step
was
to
remove
the
political
difficulties
which
stood
in
the
way
of
louis
schemes
that
is
to
dissolve
sir
temple
diplomatic
masterpiece
the
triple
alliance
the
effeminate
charles
ii
was
bought
over
by
a
large
sum
of
money
and
the
present
of
a
pretty
french
mistress
sweden
also
received
a
subsidy
and
her
schemes
of
aggrandizement
on
continental
germany
were
encouraged
meanwhile
the
illustrious
man
who
ruled
holland
showed
that
kind
of
weakness
which
good
men
often
do
in
the
presence
of
the
unscrupulous
and
wicked
john
de
witt
could
not
be
convinced
of
the
reality
of
nefarious
designs
france
had
ever
been
holland
best
friend
and
he
could
not
believe
that
the
policy
of
henry
iv
of
richelieu
and
mazarin
would
be
suddenly
reversed
by
the
young
king
of
france
he
tried
negotiations
in
which
he
was
amused
by
louis
so
long
as
it
suited
the
latter
purpose
at
last
when
the
king
preparations
were
complete
he
threw
off
the
mask
and
insultingly
told
the
dutch
that
it
was
not
for
hucksters
like
them
and
usurpers
of
authority
not
theirs
to
meddle
with
such
high
matters
then
commenced
one
of
the
brightest
pages
in
the
history
of
national
heroism
at
first
the
dutch
were
overwhelmed
town
after
town
capitulated
without
a
blow
it
seemed
as
if
the
united
provinces
were
going
to
be
subdued
as
had
been
five
years
before
but
louis
xiv
had
been
too
much
intoxicated
by
that
pride
which
goes
before
a
fall
to
retain
any
clearness
of
head
if
indeed
he
ever
had
any
in
military
matters
the
great
condé
with
his
keen
eye
for
attack
at
once
suggested
one
of
those
for
which
he
was
unequalled
among
commanders
seeing
the
dismay
of
the
dutch
he
advised
a
rapid
dash
with
six
thousand
horse
on
amsterdam
it
is
nearly
certain
if
this
advice
had
been
followed
that
the
little
commonwealth
so
precious
to
europe
would
have
been
extinguished
and
that
that
scheme
born
of
heroic
despair
of
transferring
to
batavia
under
new
stars
and
amid
a
strange
vegetation
the
treasure
of
freedom
and
valor
ruined
in
its
old
home
by
the
sardanapalus
of
versailles
might
have
been
put
in
execution
but
it
was
not
to
be
vigilant
as
louis
had
been
in
preparation
he
now
seemed
to
be
as
careless
or
incompetent
in
execution
not
only
he
neglected
the
advice
of
his
best
general
and
wasted
time
but
he
did
his
best
to
drive
his
adversaries
to
despair
and
the
resistance
which
comes
of
despair
they
were
told
by
proclamation
that
the
towns
which
should
try
to
resist
the
forces
of
his
majesty
by
opening
the
dikes
or
by
any
other
means
would
be
punished
with
the
utmost
rigor
and
when
the
frost
should
have
opened
roads
in
all
directions
his
majesty
would
give
no
sort
of
quarter
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
towns
but
would
give
orders
that
their
goods
should
be
plundered
and
their
houses
burned
the
dutch
envoys
headed
by
de
groot
son
of
the
illustrious
grotius
came
to
the
king
camp
to
know
on
what
terms
he
would
make
peace
they
were
refused
audience
by
the
theatrical
warrior
and
told
not
to
return
except
armed
with
full
powers
to
make
any
concessions
he
might
dictate
then
the
hucksters
of
amsterdam
resolved
on
a
deed
of
daring
which
is
one
of
the
most
exalted
among
the
high
traditions
of
the
world
they
opened
the
sluices
and
submerged
the
whole
country
under
water
still
their
position
was
almost
desperate
as
the
winter
frosts
were
nearly
certain
to
restore
a
firm
foothold
to
the
invader
they
came
again
suing
for
peace
offering
maestricht
the
rhine
fortresses
the
whole
of
brabant
the
whole
of
dutch
flanders
and
an
indemnity
of
ten
millions
this
was
proffering
more
than
henry
iv
richelieu
or
mazarin
had
ever
hoped
for
these
terms
were
refused
and
the
refusal
carried
with
it
practically
the
rejection
of
belgium
which
could
not
fail
to
be
soon
absorbed
when
thus
surrounded
by
french
possessions
but
louis
met
these
offers
with
the
spirit
of
an
attila
he
insisted
on
the
concession
of
southern
gueldres
and
the
island
of
bommel
millions
of
indemnity
the
endowment
of
the
catholic
religion
and
an
extraordinary
annual
embassy
charged
to
present
his
majesty
with
a
gold
medal
which
should
set
forth
how
the
dutch
owed
to
him
the
conservation
of
their
liberties
such
vindictive
cruelty
makes
the
mind
run
forward
and
dwell
with
a
glow
of
satisfied
justice
on
the
bitter
days
of
retaliation
and
revenge
which
in
a
future
still
thirty
years
off
will
humble
the
proud
and
pitiless
oppressor
in
the
dust
when
he
shall
be
a
suppliant
and
a
suppliant
in
vain
at
the
feet
of
the
haughty
victors
of
blenheim
ramillies
and
oudenarde
but
louis
mad
career
of
triumph
was
gradually
being
brought
to
a
close
he
had
before
him
not
only
the
waste
of
waters
but
the
iron
will
and
unconquerable
tenacity
of
the
young
prince
of
orange
who
needed
neither
hope
to
made
him
dare
nor
success
to
make
him
persevere
gradually
the
threatened
neighbors
of
france
gathered
together
and
against
her
king
charles
ii
was
forced
to
recede
from
the
french
alliance
by
his
parliament
in
the
military
massacre
went
on
indeed
for
some
years
longer
in
germany
and
the
netherlands
but
the
dutch
republic
was
saved
and
peace
ratified
by
the
treaty
of
nimwegen
after
the
conclusion
of
the
dutch
war
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
enters
on
a
period
of
manifest
decline
the
cost
of
the
war
had
been
tremendous
in
the
expenditure
had
been
one
hundred
ten
millions
and
colbert
had
to
meet
this
with
a
net
revenue
of
millions
the
trade
and
commerce
of
the
country
had
also
suffered
much
during
the
war
with
bitter
grief
the
great
minister
saw
himself
compelled
to
reverse
the
beneficent
policy
of
his
earlier
days
to
add
to
the
tax
on
salt
to
increase
the
burden
of
the
to
create
new
offices
hereditary
employments
in
the
government
to
the
extent
of
three
hundred
millions
augmenting
the
already
monstrous
army
of
superfluous
officials
and
finally
simply
to
borrow
money
at
high
interest
the
new
exactions
had
produced
widespread
misery
in
the
provinces
before
the
war
came
to
an
end
in
the
governor
of
dauphiné
had
written
to
colbert
saying
that
commerce
had
entirely
ceased
in
his
district
and
that
the
larger
part
of
the
people
had
lived
during
the
winter
on
bread
made
from
acorns
and
roots
and
that
at
the
time
of
his
writing
they
were
seen
to
be
eating
the
grass
of
the
fields
and
the
bark
of
trees
the
anguish
produced
at
last
despair
and
rebellion
in
bordeaux
great
excesses
were
committed
by
the
mob
which
were
punished
with
severity
six
thousand
soldiers
were
quartered
in
the
town
and
were
guilty
of
such
disorders
that
the
best
families
emigrated
and
trade
was
ruined
for
a
long
period
but
brittany
witnessed
still
worse
evils
there
also
riots
and
disturbances
had
been
produced
by
the
excessive
pressure
of
the
imposts
an
army
of
five
thousand
men
was
poured
into
the
province
and
inflicted
such
terror
on
the
population
that
the
wretched
peasants
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
soldiers
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
and
exclaimed
the
lively
madame
de
sévigné
gives
us
some
interesting
details
concerning
these
events
in
the
intervals
when
court
scandal
ran
low
and
the
brave
doings
of
madame
de
montespan
suffered
a
temporary
interruption
would
you
like
says
the
lady
to
her
daughter
would
you
like
to
have
news
of
rennes
there
are
still
five
thousand
soldiers
here
as
more
have
come
from
nantes
a
tax
of
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
has
been
laid
upon
the
citizens
and
if
the
money
is
not
forthcoming
in
hours
the
tax
will
be
doubled
and
levied
by
the
soldiers
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
large
street
have
already
been
driven
out
and
banished
and
no
one
may
receive
them
under
pain
of
death
so
that
all
these
poor
wretches
old
men
women
recently
delivered
and
children
were
seen
wandering
in
tears
as
they
left
the
town
not
knowing
whither
to
go
or
where
to
sleep
or
what
to
eat
the
day
before
yesterday
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
riot
was
broken
alive
on
the
wheel
sixty
citizens
have
been
seized
and
the
hanging
will
begin
in
other
letters
she
writes
that
the
tenth
man
had
been
broken
on
the
wheel
and
she
thinks
he
will
be
the
last
and
that
by
dint
of
hanging
it
will
soon
be
left
off
such
was
the
emaciated
france
which
louis
the
great
picked
systematically
to
the
bone
for
the
next
years
he
had
long
ceased
to
be
guided
by
the
patriotic
wisdom
of
the
great
colbert
his
evil
genius
now
was
the
haughty
and
reckless
louvois
who
carefully
abstained
from
imitating
the
noble
and
daring
remonstrances
against
excessive
expenditure
which
colbert
addressed
to
his
master
and
through
which
he
lost
his
influence
at
court
still
with
a
really
heroic
colbert
begged
urged
supplicated
the
king
to
reduce
his
outlay
he
represented
the
misery
of
the
people
all
letters
that
come
from
the
provinces
whether
from
the
intendants
the
and
even
the
bishops
speak
of
it
he
wrote
to
the
king
he
insisted
on
a
reduction
of
the
taille
by
five
or
six
millions
and
surely
it
was
time
when
its
collection
gave
rise
to
such
scenes
as
have
just
been
described
it
was
in
vain
the
king
shut
his
eyes
to
mercy
and
reason
his
gigantic
war
expenditure
when
peace
came
was
only
partially
reduced
for
indeed
he
was
still
at
war
but
with
nature
and
difficulties
of
his
own
making
he
was
building
versailles
transplanting
to
its
arid
sands
whole
groves
of
trees
from
the
depths
of
distant
forests
and
erecting
the
costly
and
fantastic
marvel
of
marli
to
afford
a
supply
of
water
buildings
cost
first
and
last
a
sum
which
would
be
represented
by
about
twenty
million
pounds
the
amount
squandered
on
pensions
was
also
very
great
the
great
colbert
days
were
drawing
to
a
close
and
he
was
very
sad
it
is
related
that
a
friend
on
one
occasion
surprised
him
looking
out
of
a
window
in
his
château
of
sceau
lost
in
thought
and
apparently
gazing
on
the
fields
of
his
own
manor
when
he
came
out
of
his
reverie
his
friend
asked
him
his
thoughts
as
i
look
he
said
on
these
fertile
fields
i
can
not
help
remembering
what
i
have
seen
elsewhere
what
a
rich
country
is
france
if
the
king
enemies
would
let
him
enjoy
peace
it
would
be
possible
to
procure
the
people
that
relief
and
comfort
which
the
great
henry
promised
them
i
could
wish
that
my
projects
had
a
happy
issue
that
abundance
reigned
in
the
kingdom
that
everyone
were
content
in
it
and
that
without
employment
or
dignities
far
from
the
court
and
business
i
saw
the
grass
grow
in
my
home
farm
the
faithful
indefatigable
worker
was
breaking
down
losing
strength
losing
heart
but
still
struggling
on
manfully
to
the
last
it
was
noticed
that
he
sat
down
to
his
work
with
a
sorrowful
despondent
look
and
not
as
had
been
his
wont
rubbing
his
hands
with
the
prospect
of
toil
and
exulting
in
his
almost
superhuman
capacity
for
labor
the
ingratitude
of
the
king
whom
he
had
served
only
too
well
gave
him
the
final
blow
louis
with
truculent
insolence
reproached
him
with
the
frightful
expenses
of
versailles
as
if
they
were
colbert
fault
colbert
who
had
always
urged
the
completion
of
the
louvre
and
the
suppression
of
versailles
at
last
the
foregone
giant
lay
down
to
die
a
tardy
touch
of
feeling
induced
louis
to
write
him
a
letter
he
would
not
read
it
i
will
hear
no
more
about
the
king
he
said
let
him
at
least
allow
me
to
die
in
peace
my
business
now
is
with
the
king
of
kings
if
he
continued
unconsciously
we
may
be
sure
plagiarizing
wolsey
if
i
had
done
for
god
what
i
have
done
for
that
man
my
salvation
would
be
secure
ten
times
over
and
now
i
know
not
what
will
become
of
me
surely
a
tender
and
touching
evidence
of
sweetness
in
the
strong
man
who
had
been
so
readily
accused
of
harshness
by
grasping
courtiers
the
ignorant
ingratitude
of
the
people
was
even
perhaps
more
melancholy
than
the
wilful
ingratitude
of
the
king
the
great
colbert
had
to
be
buried
by
night
lest
his
remains
should
be
insulted
by
the
mob
he
whose
heart
had
bled
for
the
people
sore
anguish
was
rashly
supposed
to
be
the
cause
of
that
anguish
it
was
a
sad
conclusion
to
a
great
life
but
he
would
have
seen
still
sadder
days
if
he
had
lived
the
health
of
the
luxurious
louis
sensibly
declined
after
he
had
passed
his
fortieth
year
in
spite
of
his
robust
appearance
he
had
never
been
really
strong
his
loose
lymphatic
constitution
required
much
support
and
management
but
he
habitually
himself
he
was
indeed
a
gross
and
greedy
glutton
i
have
often
seen
the
king
says
the
duchess
of
orleans
eat
four
platefuls
of
various
soups
a
whole
pheasant
a
partridge
a
large
dish
of
salad
stewed
mutton
with
garlic
two
good
slices
of
ham
a
plate
of
pastry
and
then
fruit
and
sweetmeats
a
most
unwholesome
habit
of
body
was
the
result
an
abscess
formed
in
his
upper
jaw
and
caused
a
perforation
of
the
palate
which
obliged
him
to
be
very
careful
in
drinking
as
the
liquid
was
apt
to
pass
through
the
aperture
and
come
out
by
the
nostrils
he
felt
weak
and
depressed
and
began
to
think
seriously
about
making
his
salvation
his
courtly
priests
and
confessors
had
never
inculcated
any
duties
but
two
that
of
chastity
and
that
of
religious
intolerance
and
he
had
been
very
remiss
in
both
he
now
resolved
to
make
hasty
reparation
the
ample
charms
of
the
haughty
montespan
fascinated
him
no
more
he
tried
a
new
mistress
but
she
did
not
turn
out
well
madame
de
fontanges
was
young
and
exquisitely
pretty
but
a
giddy
presuming
fool
she
moreover
died
shortly
he
was
more
than
ever
disposed
to
make
his
salvation
that
is
to
renounce
the
sins
of
the
flesh
and
to
persecute
his
subjects
the
protestants
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
and
follies
which
history
records
was
too
colossal
a
misdeed
for
the
guilt
of
its
perpetration
to
be
charged
upon
one
man
however
wicked
or
however
powerful
he
may
have
been
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
louis
was
the
exponent
of
conditions
the
visible
representative
of
circumstances
which
he
had
done
nothing
to
create
just
as
he
was
the
strongest
king
france
ever
had
without
having
contributed
himself
to
the
predominance
of
the
monarchy
so
in
the
blind
and
cruel
policy
of
intolerance
which
led
to
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
he
was
the
delegate
and
instrument
of
forces
which
existed
independently
of
him
a
willing
instrument
no
doubt
a
representative
of
sinister
forces
a
chooser
of
the
evil
part
when
mere
inaction
would
have
been
equivalent
to
a
choice
of
the
good
still
it
is
due
to
historic
accuracy
to
point
out
that
had
he
not
been
seconded
by
the
existing
condition
of
france
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
effect
the
evil
he
ultimately
brought
about
louis
reign
continued
thirty
years
after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
years
crowded
with
events
particularly
for
the
military
historian
but
over
the
details
of
which
we
shall
not
linger
on
this
occasion
the
brilliant
reign
becomes
unbearably
wearisome
in
its
final
period
the
monotonous
repetition
of
the
same
faults
and
the
same
crimes
profligate
extravagance
revolting
cruelty
and
tottering
incapacity
is
as
fatiguing
as
it
is
uninstructive
louis
became
a
mere
mummy
embalmed
in
etiquette
the
puppet
of
his
women
and
shavelings
the
misery
in
the
provinces
grew
apace
but
there
was
no
disturbance
france
was
too
prostrate
even
to
groan
in
the
expenditure
amounted
to
two
hundred
forty
millions
and
the
revenue
to
one
hundred
thirteen
millions
but
from
this
no
less
than
millions
had
to
be
deducted
for
various
liabilities
the
government
had
incurred
leaving
only
a
net
income
of
millions
that
is
to
say
the
outlay
was
more
than
six
times
the
income
the
armies
were
neither
paid
nor
fed
the
officers
received
de
which
they
got
cashed
at
a
discount
of
per
cent
the
government
had
anticipated
by
ten
years
its
revenues
from
the
towns
still
this
pale
corpse
of
france
must
needs
be
bled
anew
to
gratify
the
inexorable
jesuits
who
had
again
made
themselves
complete
masters
of
louis
xiv
mind
he
had
lost
his
confessor
père
la
chaise
who
died
in
and
had
replaced
him
by
the
hideous
letellier
a
blind
and
fierce
fanatic
with
a
horrible
squint
and
a
countenance
fit
for
the
gallows
he
would
have
frightened
anyone
says
who
met
him
at
the
corner
of
a
wood
this
repulsive
personage
revived
the
persecution
of
the
protestants
into
a
fiercer
heat
than
ever
and
obtained
from
the
moribund
king
the
edict
of
march
considered
by
competent
judges
the
clear
masterpiece
of
clerical
injustice
and
cruelty
five
months
later
louis
xiv
died
forsaken
by
his
intriguing
wife
his
beloved
bastard
the
due
de
maine
and
his
dreaded
priest
the
french
monarchy
never
recovered
from
the
strain
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
during
the
long
and
exhausting
reign
of
louis
xiv
whether
it
could
have
recovered
in
the
hands
of
a
great
statesman
summoned
in
time
is
a
curious
question
could
frederick
the
great
have
saved
it
had
he
been
louis
xiv
successor
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
he
would
have
adjourned
if
not
have
averted
the
great
catastrophe
of
but
it
is
one
of
the
inseparable
accidents
of
such
a
despotism
as
france
had
fallen
under
that
nothing
but
consummate
genius
can
save
it
from
ruin
and
the
accession
of
genius
to
the
throne
in
such
circumstances
is
a
physiological
impossibility
the
house
of
bourbon
had
become
as
effete
as
the
house
of
valois
in
the
sixteenth
century
as
effete
as
the
merovingians
and
carlovingians
had
become
in
a
previous
age
but
the
strong
chain
of
hereditary
right
bound
up
the
fortunes
of
a
great
empire
with
the
feeble
brain
and
bestial
instincts
of
a
louis
xv
this
was
the
result
of
concentrating
all
the
active
force
of
the
state
in
one
predestined
irremovable
human
being
this
was
the
logical
and
necessary
outcome
of
the
labors
of
philip
augustus
philip
the
fair
of
louis
xi
of
henry
iv
and
richelieu
they
had
reared
the
monarchy
like
a
solitary
obelisk
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
but
it
had
to
stand
or
fall
alone
no
one
was
there
to
help
it
as
no
one
was
there
to
pull
it
down
this
consideration
enables
us
to
pass
into
a
higher
and
more
reposing
order
of
reflection
to
leave
the
sterile
impeachment
of
individual
incapacity
and
rise
to
the
broader
question
and
ask
why
and
how
that
incapacity
was
endowed
with
such
fatal
potency
for
evil
as
it
has
been
well
remarked
the
loss
of
a
battle
may
lead
to
the
loss
of
a
state
but
then
what
are
the
deeper
reasons
which
explain
why
the
loss
of
a
battle
should
lead
to
the
loss
of
a
state
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
louis
xiv
was
an
improvident
and
passionate
ruler
that
louis
xv
was
a
dreary
and
revolting
voluptuary
the
problem
is
rather
this
why
were
improvidence
passion
and
debauchery
in
two
men
able
to
bring
down
in
utter
ruin
one
of
the
greatest
monarchies
the
world
has
ever
seen
in
other
words
what
was
the
cause
of
the
consummate
failure
the
unexampled
collapse
of
the
french
monarchy
no
personal
insufficiency
of
individual
rulers
will
explain
it
and
besides
the
french
monarchy
repeatedly
disposed
of
the
services
of
admirable
rulers
history
has
recorded
few
more
able
kings
than
louis
le
gros
philip
augustus
philip
le
bel
louis
xi
and
henry
iv
few
abler
ministers
than
sully
richelieu
colbert
and
turgot
yet
the
efforts
of
all
these
distinguished
men
resulted
in
leading
the
nation
straight
into
the
most
astounding
catastrophe
in
human
annals
whatever
view
we
take
of
the
revolution
whether
we
regard
it
as
a
blessing
or
as
a
curse
we
must
needs
admit
it
was
a
reaction
of
the
most
violent
kind
a
reaction
contrary
to
the
preceding
action
the
old
monarchy
can
only
claim
to
have
produced
the
revolution
in
the
sense
of
having
provoked
it
as
intemperance
has
been
known
to
produce
sobriety
and
extravagance
parsimony
if
the
led
in
the
result
to
an
abrupt
transition
to
the
modern
era
it
was
only
because
it
had
rendered
the
old
era
so
utterly
execrable
to
mankind
that
escape
in
any
direction
seemed
a
relief
were
it
over
a
precipice
new
york
taken
by
the
english
john
brodhead
for
half
a
century
the
dutch
colony
in
new
york
then
called
new
netherlands
had
developed
under
various
administrations
when
british
conquest
brought
it
under
another
dominion
this
transfer
of
the
government
affected
the
whole
future
of
the
colony
and
of
the
great
state
into
which
it
grew
although
the
original
dutch
influence
has
never
disappeared
from
its
character
and
history
under
peter
stuyvesant
the
last
dutch
governor
the
colony
made
great
progress
he
conciliated
the
indians
agreed
upon
a
boundary
line
with
the
english
colonists
at
hartford
connecticut
and
took
possession
of
the
colony
of
new
sweden
in
delaware
meanwhile
the
english
colonists
in
different
parts
of
north
america
were
carrying
on
illicit
trade
with
the
dutch
at
new
amsterdam
new
york
city
the
english
government
already
jealous
of
the
growing
commerce
of
holland
was
irritated
by
the
loss
of
revenue
and
resolved
in
upon
the
conquest
of
new
netherlands
brodhead
the
historian
of
new
york
recounts
the
steps
of
this
conquest
in
a
manner
which
brings
the
rival
powers
and
their
agents
distinctly
before
us
england
now
determined
boldly
to
rob
holland
of
her
american
province
king
charles
ii
accordingly
sealed
a
patent
granting
to
the
duke
of
york
and
albany
a
large
territory
in
america
comprehending
long
island
and
the

all
the

and

from
the
west
side
of
the
connecticut
river
to
the
east
side
of

this
sweeping
grant
included
the
whole
of

and
a
part
of
the
territory
of
connecticut
which
two
years
before
charles
had
confirmed
to

and
his
associates
the
duke
of

lost
no

in
giving

with
their

intrusted
to

royalist
who
had
served
under
turenne
with
james
and
had
been
made
one
of

of
his
bedchamber
nicolls
was
also
appointed
to

sir
robert
carr
colonel
george

and
samuel
maverick
as
royal
commissioners
to
visit
the
several
colonies
in

these
commissioners
were
furnished
with
detailed
instructions
and
the
new
england
governments
were
required
by
royal
letters
to
join
and
assist
them
vigorously
in
reducing
the
dutch
to
subjection
a
month
after
the
departure
of

the
duke
of

conveyed
to

intelligence
from
boston
that
an
english
expedition
against
new
netherlands
had
sailed
from
portsmouth
was
soon
communicated
to
stuyvesant
by
captain
thomas
willett
and
the
burgomasters
and
of
new
amsterdam
were
summoned
to
assist
the
council
with
their
advice
the
capital
was
ordered
to
be
put
in
a
state
of
defence
guards
to
be
maintained
and
to
be
warned
as
there
was
very
little
powder
at
fort
amsterdam
a
supply
was
demanded
from
new
amstel
and
a
loan
of
five
or
six
thousand
guilders
was
asked
from
rensselaerswyck
the
ships
about
to
sail
for
curaçao
were
stopped
agents
were
sent
to
purchase
provisions
at
new
haven
and
as
the
enemy
was
expected
to
approach
through
long
island
sound
spies
were
sent
to
obtain
intelligence
at
west
chester
and
milford
but
at
the
moment
when
no
precaution
should
have
been
relaxed
a
despatch
from
the
west
india
directors
who
appear
to
have
been
misled
by
advices
from
london
announced
that
no
danger
need
be
apprehended
from
the
english
expedition
as
it
was
sent
out
by
the
king
only
to
settle
the
affairs
of
his
colonies
and
establish
episcopacy
which
would
rather
benefit
the
company
interests
in
new
netherlands
willett
now
retracting
his
previous
statements
a
perilous
confidence
returned
the
curaçao
ships
were
allowed
to
sail
and
stuyvesant
yielded
to
the
solicitation
of
his
council
went
up
the
river
to
look
after
affairs
at
fort
orange
the
english
squadron
had
been
ordered
to
assemble
at
gardiner
island
but
parting
company
in
a
fog
the
guinea
with
nicolls
and
cartwright
on
board
made
cape
cod
and
went
on
to
boston
while
the
other
ships
put
in
at
piscataway
the
commissioners
immediately
demanded
the
assistance
of
massachusetts
but
the
people
of
the
bay
who
feared
perhaps
that
the
king
success
in
reducing
the
dutch
would
enable
him
the
better
to
put
down
his
enemies
in
new
england
were
full
of
excuses
connecticut
however
showed
sufficient
alacrity
and
winthrop
was
desired
to
meet
the
squadron
at
the
west
end
of
long
island
whither
it
would
sail
with
the
first
fair
wind
when
the
truth
of
willett
intelligence
became
confirmed
the
council
sent
an
express
to
recall
stuyvesant
from
fort
orange
hurrying
back
to
the
capital
the
anxious
director
endeavored
to
redeem
the
time
which
had
been
lost
the
municipal
authorities
ordered
of
inhabitants
without
exception
to
labor
every
third
day
at
the
fortifications
organized
a
permanent
guard
forbade
the
brewers
to
malt
any
grain
and
called
on
the
provincial
government
for
artillery
and
ammunition
six
pieces
besides
the
fourteen
previously
allotted
and
a
thousand
pounds
of
powder
were
accordingly
granted
to
the
city
the
colonists
around
fort
orange
pleading
their
own
danger
from
the
savages
could
afford
no
help
but
the
soldiers
of
esopus
were
ordered
to
come
down
after
leaving
a
small
garrison
at
ronduit
in
the
mean
time
the
english
squadron
had
anchored
just
below
the
narrows
in
nyack
bay
between
new
utrecht
and
coney
island
the
mouth
of
the

was
shut
up

and
the

on

seized
stuyvesant
now
despatched
counsellor
de
decker
burgomaster
van
der
grist
and
the
two
domines
megapolensis
with
a
letter
to
the
english
commanders
inquiring
why
they
had
come
and
why
they
continued
at
nyack
without
giving
notice
the
next
morning
which
was
saturday
nicolls
sent
colonel
cartwright
captain
needham
captain
groves
and
thomas
delavall
up
to
fort
amsterdam
with
a
summons
for
the
surrender
of
the
town
situate
on
the
island
and
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
manhatoes
with
all
the
forts
thereunto
belonging
this
summons
was
accompanied
by
a
proclamation
declaring
that
all
who
would
submit
to
his
majesty
government
should
be
protected
in
his
laws
and
justice
and
peaceably
enjoy
their
property
stuyvesant
immediately
called
together
the
council
and
the
burgomasters
but
would
not
allow
the
terms
offered
by
nicolls
to
be
communicated
to
the
people
lest
they
might
insist
on
capitulating
in
a
short
time
several
of
the
burghers
and
city
officers
assembled
at
the
it
was
determined
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
surprising
the
town
but
as
opinion
was
generally
against
protracted
resistance
a
copy
of
the
english
communication
was
asked
from
the
director
on
the
following
monday
the
burgomasters
explained
to
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
the
terms
offered
by
nicolls
but
this
would
not
suffice
a
copy
of
the
paper
itself
must
be
exhibited
stuyvesant
then
went
in
person
to
the
meeting
such
a
course
said
he
would
be
disapproved
of
in
the
fatherland
it
would
discourage
the
people
all
his
efforts
however
were
in
vain
and
the
director
protesting
that
he
should
not
be
held
answerable
for
the
calamitous
consequences
was
obliged
to
yield
to
the
popular
will
nicolls
now
addressed
a
letter
to
winthrop
who
with
other
commissioners
from
new
england
had
joined
the
squadron
authorizing
him
to
assure
stuyvesant
that
if
manhattan
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
king
any
people
from
the
netherlands
may
freely
come
and
plant
there
or
thereabouts
and
such
vessels
of
their
own
country
may
freely
come
thither
and
any
of
them
may
as
freely
return
home
in
vessels
of
their
own
country
visiting
the
city
under
a
flag
of
truce
winthrop
delivered
this
to
stuyvesant
outside
the
fort
and
urged
him
to
surrender
the
director
declined
and
returning
to
the
fort
he
opened
nicolls
letter
before
the
council
and
the
burgomasters
who
desired
that
it
should
be
communicated
as
all
which
regarded
the
public
welfare
ought
to
be
made
public
against
this
stuyvesant
earnestly
remonstrated
and
finding
that
the
burgomasters
continued
firm
in
a
fit
of
passion
he
tore
the
letter
in
pieces
the
citizens
suddenly
ceasing
their
work
at
the
palisades
hurried
to
the
and
sent
three
of
their
numbers
to
the
fort
to
demand
the
letter
in
vain
the
director
hastened
to
pacify
the
burghers
and
urge
them
to
go
on
with
the
fortifications
complaints
and
curses
were
uttered
on
all
sides
against
the
company
misgovernment
resistance
was
declared
to
be
idle
the
letter
the
letter
was
the
general
cry
to
avoid
a
mutiny
stuyvesant
yielded
and
a
copy
made
out
from
the
collected
fragments
was
handed
to
the
burgomasters
in
answer
however
to
nicolls
summons
he
submitted
a
long
justification
of
the
dutch
title
yet
while
protesting
against
any
breach
of
the
peace
between
the
king
and
the
for
the
hinderance
and
prevention
of
all
differences
and
the
spilling
of
innocent
blood
not
only
in
these
parts
but
also
in
europe
he
offered
to
treat
long
island
is
gone
and
lost
the
capital
can
not
hold
out
long
was
the
last
despatch
to
the
lord
majors
of
new
netherlands
which
its
director
sent
off
that
night
in
silence
through
hell
gate
observing
stuyvesant
reluctance
to
surrender
nicolls
directed
captain
hyde
who
commanded
the
squadron
to
reduce
the
fort
two
of
the
ships
accordingly
landed
their
troops
just
below
breuckelen
brooklyn
where
volunteers
from
new
england
and
the
long
island
villages
had
already
encamped
the
other
two
coming
up
with
full
sail
passed
in
front
of
fort
amsterdam
and
anchored
between
it
and
nutten
island
standing
on
one
of
the
angles
of
the
fortress
an
artilleryman
with
a
lighted
match
at
his
side
the
director
watched
their
approach
at
this
moment
the
two
domines
megapolensis
imploring
him
not
to
begin
hostilities
led
stuyvesant
from
the
rampart
who
then
with
a
hundred
of
the
garrison
went
into
the
city
to
resist
the
landing
of
the
english
hoping
on
against
hope
the
director
now
sent
counsellor
de
decker
secretary
van
ruyven
burgomaster
steenwyck
and
schepen
cousseau
with
a
letter
to
nicolls
stating
that
as
he
felt
bound
to
stand
the
storm
he
desired
if
possible
to
arrange
on
accommodation
but
the
english
commander
merely
declared
i
will
speak
with
you
at
manhattan
friends
was
the
answer
will
be
welcome
if
they
come
in
a
friendly
manner
i
shall
come
with
ships
and
soldiers
replied
nicolls
raise
the
white
flag
of
peace
at
the
fort
and
then
something
may
be
considered
when
this
imperious
message
became
known
men
women
and
children
flocked
to
the
director
beseeching
him
to
submit
his
only
answer
was
i
would
rather
be
carried
out
dead
the
next
day
the
city
authorities
the
clergymen
and
the
officers
of
the
burgher
guard
assembling
at
the
at
the
suggestion
of
domine
megapolensis
adopted
a
remonstrance
to
the
director
exhibiting
the
hopeless
situation
of
new
amsterdam
on
all
sides
encompassed
and
hemmed
in
by
enemies
and
protesting
against
any
further
opposition
to
the
will
of
god
besides
the
burgomasters
and
schepens
the
remonstrance
was
signed
by
wilmerdonck
and
of
the
principal
inhabitants
among
whom
was
stuyvesant
own
son
balthazar
at
last
the
director
was
obliged
to
yield
although
there
were
now
fifteen
hundred
souls
in
new
amsterdam
there
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
fifty
men
able
to
bear
arms
besides
the
one
hundred
fifty
regular
soldiers
the
people
had
at
length
refused
to
be
called
out
and
the
regular
troops
were
already
heard
talking
of
where
booty
is
to
be
found
and
where
the
young
women
live
who
wear
gold
chains
the
city
entirely
open
along
both
rivers
was
shut
on
the
northern
side
by
a
breastwork
and
palisades
which
though
sufficient
to
keep
out
the
savages
afforded
no
defence
against
a
military
siege
there
were
scarcely
six
hundred
pounds
of
serviceable
powder
in
store
a
council
of
war
had
reported
fort
amsterdam
untenable
for
though
it
mounted
guns
its
single
wall
of
earth
not
more
than
ten
feet
high
and
four
thick
was
almost
touches
by
the
private
dwellings
clustered
around
and
was
commanded
within
a
by
hills
on
the
north
over
which
ran
the
heereweg
or
broadway
upon
the
faith
of
nicolls
promise
to
deliver
back
the
city
and
fort
in
case
the
difference
of
the
limits
of
this
province
be
agreed
upon
betwixt
his
majesty
of
england
and
the
high
and
mighty
stuyvesant

commissioned

and

jacques
cousseau
to
agree
upon
articles
with
the
english
commander
or
his
representatives
nicolls
on
his
part
appointed
sir
robert
carr
and
colonel
george
cartwright
john
winthrop
and
samuel
willys
of
connecticut
and
thomas
clarke
and
john
pynchon
of
massachusetts
the
reason
why
those
of
boston
and
connecticut
were
joined
afterward
explained
the
royal
commander
was
because
those
two
colonies
should
hold
themselves
the
more
engaged
with
us
if
the
dutch
had
been
overconfident
of
their
strength
at
eight
the
next
morning
which
was
saturday
the
commissioners
on
both
sides
met
at
stuyvesant
bouwery
and
arranged
the
terms
of
capitulation
the
only
difference
which
arose
was
respecting
the
dutch
soldiers
whom
the
english
refused
to
convey
back
to
holland
the
articles
of
capitulation
promised
the
dutch
security
in
their
property
customs
of
inheritance
liberty
of
conscience
and
church
discipline
the
municipal
officers
of
manhattan
were
to
continue
for
the
present
unchanged
and
the
town
was
to
be
allowed
to
choose
deputies
with
free
voices
in
all
public
affairs
owners
of
property
in
fort
orange
might
if
they
pleased
slight
the
fortifications
there
and
enjoy
their
houses
as
people
do
where
there
is
no
fort
for
six
months
there
was
to
be
free
intercourse
with
holland
public
records
were
to
be
respected
the
articles
consented
to
by
nicolls
were
to
be
ratified
by
stuyvesant
the
next
monday
morning
at
eight
and
within
two
hours
afterward
the
fort
and
town
called
new
amsterdam
upon
the
isle
of
manhatoes
were
to
be
delivered
up
and
the
military
officers
and
soldiers
were
to
march
out
with
their
arms
drums
beating
and
colors
flying
and
lighted
matches
on
the
following
monday
morning
at
eight
stuyvesant
at
the
head
of
the
garrison
marched
out
of
fort
amsterdam
with
all
the
honors
of
war
and
led
his
soldiers
down
the
beaver
lane
to
the
whence
they
were
embarked
for
holland
an
english
corporal
guard
at
the
same
time
took
possession
of
the
fort
and
nicolls
and
carr
with
their
two
companies
about
a
hundred
seventy
strong
entered
the
city
while
cartwright
took
possession
of
the
gates
and
the
the
new
england
and
long
island
volunteers
however
were
prudently
kept
at
the
breuckelen
ferry
as
the
citizens
dreaded
most
being
plundered
by
them
the
english
flag
was
hoisted
on
fort
amsterdam
the
name
of
which
was
immediately
changed
to
fort
james
nicolls
was
now
proclaimed
by
the
burgomasters
for
the
duke
of
york
in
compliment
to
whom
he
directed
that
the
city
of
new
amsterdam
should
thenceforth
be
known
as
new
york
to
nicolls
european
eye
the
dutch
metropolis
with
its
earthen
fort
enclosing
a
windmill
and
high
a
prison
and
a
governor
house
and
a
church
above
which
loomed
a
square
tower
its
gallows
and
at
the
river
side
and
its
rows
of
houses
which
hugged
the
citadel
presented
but
a
mean
appearance
yet
before
long
he
described
it
to
the
duke
as
the
best
of
all
his
majesty
towns
in
america
and
assured
his
royal
highness
that
with
proper
management
within
five
years
the
staple
of
america
will
be
drawn
hither
of
which
the
brethren
of
boston
are
very
sensible
the
dutch
frontier
posts
were
thought
of
next
colonel
cartwright
with
captains
thomas
willett
john
manning
thomas
breedon
and
daniel
brodhead
were
sent
to
fort
orange
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
letter
from
nicolls
requiring
la
montagne
and
the
magistrates
and
inhabitants
to
aid
in
prosecuting
his
majesty
interest
against
all
who
should
oppose
a
peaceable
surrender
at
the
same
time
van
rensselaer
was
desired
to
bring
down
his
patent
and
papers
to
the
new
governor
and
likewise
to
observe
cartwright
directions
counsellor
de
decker
however
travelling
up
to
fort
george
ahead
of
the
english
commissioners
endeavored
without
avail
to
excite
the
inhabitants
to
opposition
and
his
conduct
being
judged
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
capitulation
which
he
had
signed
he
was
soon
afterward
ordered
out
of
nicolls
government
the
garrison
quietly
surrendered
and
the
name
of
fort
orange
was
changed
to
that
of
fort
albany
after
the
second
title
of
the
duke
of
york
a
treaty
was
immediately
signed
between
cartwright
and
the
sachems
of
the
iroquois
who
were
promised
the
same
advantages
as
heretofore
they
had
from
the
dutch
and
the
alliance
which
was
thus
renewed
continued
unbroken
until
the
beginning
of
the
american
revolution
it
only
remained
to
reduce
the
south
river
whither
sir
robert
carr
was
sent
with
the
guinea
the
william
and
nicholas
and
all
the
soldiers
which
are
not
in
the
fort
to
the
dutch
he
was
instructed
to
promise
all
their
privileges
only
that
they
change
their
masters
to
the
swedes
he
was
to
remonstrate
their
happy
return
under
a
monarchical
government
to
lord
baltimore
officers
in
maryland
he
was
to
say
that
their
pretended
rights
being
a
doubtful
case
possession
would
be
kept
until
his
majesty
is
informed
and
satisfied
otherwise
a
tedious
voyage
brought
the
expedition
before
new
amstel
the
burghers
and
planters
after
almost
three
days
parley
agreed
to
carr
demands
and
ffob
oothout
with
five
others
signed
articles
of
capitulation
which
promised
large
privileges
but
the
governor
and
soldiery
refusing
the
english
propositions
the
fort
was
stormed
and
plundered
three
of
the
dutch
being
killed
and
ten
wounded
in
violation
of
his
promises
carr
now
exhibited
the
most
disgraceful
rapacity
appropriated
farms
to
himself
his
brother
and
captains
hyde
and
morely
stripped
bare
the
inhabitants
and
sent
the
dutch
soldiers
to
be
sold
as
slaves
in
virginia
to
complete
the
work
a
boat
was
despatched
to
the
city
colony
at
the
horekill
which
was
seized
and
plundered
of
all
its
effects
and
the
marauding
party
even
took
what
belonged
to
the
quacking
society
of
plockhoy
to
a
very
naile
the
reduction
of
new
netherlands
was
now
accomplished
all
that
could
be
further
done
was
to
change
its
name
and
to
glorify
one
of
the
most
bigoted
princes
in
english
history
the
royal
province
was
ordered
to
be
called
new
york
ignorant
of
james
grant
of
new
jersey
to
berkeley
and
carteret
nicolls
gave
to
the
region
west
of
the
hudson
the
name
of
albania
and
to
long
island
that
of
yorkshire
so
as
to
comprehend
all
the
titles
of
the
duke
of
york
the
flag
of
england
was
at
length
triumphantly
displayed
where
for
half
a
century
that
of
holland
had
rightfully
waved
and
from
virginia
to
canada
the
king
of
great
britain
was
acknowledged
as
sovereign
viewed
in
all
its
aspects
the
event
which
gave
to
the
whole
of
that
country
a
unity
in
allegiance
and
to
which
a
misgoverned
people
complacently
submitted
was
as
inevitable
as
it
was
momentous
but
whatever
may
have
been
its
ultimate
consequences
this
treacherous
and
violent
seizure
of
the
territory
and
possessions
of
an
unsuspecting
ally
was
no
less
a
breach
of
private
justice
than
of
public
faith
it
may
indeed
be
affirmed
that
among
all
the
acts
of
selfish
perfidy
which
royal
ingratitude
conceived
and
executed
there
have
been
few
more
characteristic
and
none
more
base

plague
in
london
daniel
defoe
none
of
the
great
visitations
of
disease
that
have
afflicted
europe
within
historic
times
has
wholly
spared
england
but
from
the
time
of
the
black
death
the
country
experienced
no
such
suffering
from
any
epidemic
as
that
which
fell
upon
london
in
that
year
the
great
plague
is
said
to
have
destroyed
the
lives
of
nearly
one
hundred
thousand
people
in
england
capital
the
plague
had
previously
cropped
up
there
every
few
years
from
lack
of
proper
sanitation
at
the
time
of
this
outbreak
the
of
the
city
was
notoriously
impure
in
the
heat
was
uncommonly
severe
pepys
said
that
june
of
that
year
was
the
hottest
day
that
he
had
ever
known
the
plague
of
is
said
however
to
have
been
brought
in
merchandise
directly
from
holland
where
it
had
been
smouldering
for
several
years
its
ravages
in
london
have
often
been
described
and
defoe
found
in
the
calamity
a
subject
for
a
special
story
on
history
probably
he
was
not
more
than
six
years
old
when
the
plague
appeared
but
he
assumes
throughout
the
pose
of
a
respectable
and
religious
householder
of
the
period
all
his
own
recollections
all
the
legends
of
the
time
and
the
parish
records
are
grouped
in
masterly
fashion
to
form
a
single
picture
the
account
has
been
described
as
a
masterpiece
of
verisimilitude
in
the
first
place
a
blazing
star
or
comet
appeared
for
several
months
before
the
plague
as
there
did
the
year
after
a
little
before
the
great
fire
the
old
women
and
the
portion
of
the
other
sex
whom
i
could
almost
call
old
women
too
remarked
especially
afterward
though
not
till
both
those
judgments
were
over
that
those
two
comets
passed
directly
over
the
city
and
that
so
very
near
the
houses
that
it
was
plain
they
imported
something
peculiar
to
the
city
alone
that
the
comet
before
the
pestilence
was
of
a
faint
dull
languid
color
and
its
motion
very
heavy
solemn
and
slow
but
that
the
comet
before
the
fire
was
bright
and
sparkling
or
as
others
said
flaming
and
its
motion
swift
and
furious
and
that
accordingly
one
foretold
a
heavy
judgment
slow
but
severe
terrible
and
frightful
as
the
plague
was
but
the
other
foretold
a
stroke
sudden
swift
and
fiery
like
the
conflagration
nay
so
particular
some
people
were
that
as
they
looked
upon
that
comet
preceding
the
fire
they
fancied
that
they
not
only
saw
it
pass
swiftly
and
fiercely
and
could
perceive
the
motion
with
the
eye
but
they
even
heard
it
that
it
made
a
rushing
mighty
noise
fierce
and
terrible
though
at
a
distance
and
but
just
perceivable
i
saw
both
these
stars
and
i
must
confess
had
so
much
of
the
common
notion
of
such
things
in
my
head
that
i
was
apt
to
look
upon
them
as
the
forerunners
and
warnings
of
god
judgments
and
especially
when
after
the
plague
had
followed
the
first
i
yet
saw
another
of
the
like
kind
i
could
not
but
say
god
had
not
yet
sufficiently
scourged
the
city
but
i
could
not
at
the
same
time
carry
these
things
to
the
height
that
others
did
knowing
too
that
natural
causes
are
assigned
by
the
astronomers
for
such
things
and
that
their
motions
and
even
their
evolutions
are
calculated
or
pretended
to
be
calculated
so
that
they
can
not
be
so
perfectly
called
the
forerunners
or
foretellers
much
less
the
procurers
of
such
events
as
pestilence
war
fire
and
the
like
but
let
my
thoughts
and
the
thoughts
of
the
philosophers
be
or
have
been
what
they
will
these
things
had
a
more
than
ordinary
influence
upon
the
minds
of
the
common
people
and
they
had
almost
universally
melancholy
apprehensions
of
some
dreadful
calamity
and
judgment
coming
upon
the
city
and
this
principally
from
the
sight
of
this
comet
and
the
little
alarm
that
was
given
in
december
by
two
people
dying
in
giles
the
apprehensions
of
the
people
were
likewise
strangely
increased
by
the
error
of
the
times
in
which
i
think
the
people
from
what
principles
i
can
not
imagine
were
more
addicted
to
prophecies
and
astrological
conjurations
dreams
and
old
wives
tales
than
ever
they
were
before
or
since
whether
this
unhappy
temper
was
originally
raised
by
the
follies
of
some
people
who
got
money
by
it
that
is
to
say
by
printing
predictions
and
prognostications
i
know
not
but
certain
it
is
books
frightened
them
terribly
such
as
almanack
gadbury
allogical
predictions
poor
robin
and
the
like
also
several
pretended
religious
books
one
entitled
out
of
her
my
people
lest
you
be
partaker
of
her
another
called
another
and
many
such
all
or
most
part
of
which
foretold
directly
or
covertly
the
ruin
of
the
city
nay
some
were
so
enthusiastically
bold
as
to
run
about
the
streets
with
their
oral
predictions
pretending
they
were
sent
to
preach
to
the
city
and
one
in
particular
who
like
jonah
to
nineveh
cried
in
the
streets
yet
forty
days
and
london
shall
be
destroyed
i
will
not
be
positive
whether
he
said
yet
forty
days
or
yet
a
few
days
another
ran
about
naked
except
a
pair
of
drawers
about
his
waist
crying
day
and
night
as
a
man
that
josephus
mentions
who
cried
woe
to
jerusalem
a
little
before
the
destruction
of
that
city
so
this
poor
naked
creature
cried
o
the
great
and
the
dreadful
god
and
said
no
more
but
repeated
these
words
continually
with
a
voice
and
countenance
full
of
horror
a
swift
pace
and
nobody
could
ever
find
him
to
stop
or
rest
or
take
any
sustenance
at
least
that
ever
i
could
hear
of
i
met
this
poor
creature
several
times
in
the
streets
and
would
have
spoken
to
him
but
he
would
not
enter
into
conversation
with
me
or
anyone
else
but
held
on
his
dismal
cries
continually
these
things
terrified
the
people
to
the
last
degree
and
especially
when
two
or
three
times
as
i
have
mentioned
already
they
found
one
or
two
in
the
bills
dead
of
the
plague
at
giles
the
justices
of
peace
for
middlesex
by
direction
of
the
secretary
of
state
had
begun
to
shut
up
houses
in
the
parishes
of
martin
clement
danes
and
it
was
with
good
success
for
in
several
streets
where
the
plague
broke
out
after
strictly
guarding
the
houses
that
were
infected
and
taking
care
to
bury
those
that
died
immediately
after
they
were
known
to
be
dead
the
plague
ceased
in
those
streets
it
was
also
observed
that
the
plague
decreased
sooner
in
those
parishes
after
they
had
been
visited
in
detail
than
it
did
in
the
parishes
of
bishopsgate
shoreditch
aldgate
whitechapel
stepney
and
others
the
early
care
taken
in
that
manner
being
a
great
check
to
it
this
shutting
up
of
houses
was
a
method
first
taken
as
i
understand
in
the
plague
which
happened
in
on
the
accession
of
king
james
i
to
the
crown
and
the
power
of
shutting
people
up
in
their
own
houses
was
granted
by
an
act
of
parliament
entitled
an
act
for
the
charitable
relief
and
ordering
of
persons
infected
with
the
plague
on
which
act
of
parliament
the
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
of
the
city
of
london
founded
the
order
they
made
at
this
time
june
when
the
numbers
infected
within
the
city
were
but
few
the
last
bill
for
the
parishes
being
but
four
by
these
means
when
there
died
about
one
thousand
a
week
in
the
whole
the
number
in
the
city
was
but
and
the
city
was
more
healthy
in
proportion
than
any
other
place
all
the
time
of
the
infection
these
orders
of
my
lord
mayor
were
published
as
i
have
said
toward
the
end
of
june
they
came
into
operation
from
july
ist
and
were
as
follows
conceived
and
published
by
the
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
of
the
city
of
london
concerning
the
infection
of
the
whereas
in
the
reign
of
our
late
sovereign
king
james
of
happy
memory
an
act
was
made
for
the
charitable
relief
and
ordering
of
persons
infected
with
the
plague
whereby
authority
was
given
to
justices
of
the
peace
mayors
bailiffs
and
other
head
officers
to
appoint
within
their
several
limits
examiners
searchers
watchmen
surgeons
and
and
buriers
for
the
persons
and
places
infected
and
to
minister
unto
them
oaths
for
the
performance
of
their
offices
and
the
same
statute
did
also
authorize
the
giving
of
other
directions
as
unto
them
for
the
present
necessity
should
seem
good
in
their
discretions
it
is
now
upon
special
consideration
thought
very
expedient
for
preventing
and
avoiding
of
infection
of
sickness
if
it
shall
so
please
almighty
god
that
these
officers
be
appointed
and
these
orders
hereafter
duly
observed
then
follow
the
orders
giving
these
officers
instructions
in
detail
and
prescribing
the
extent
and
limits
of
their
several
duties
next
concerning
infected
houses
and
persons
sick
of
the
these
had
reference
to
the
notice
to
be
given
of
the
sickness
sequestration
of
the
sick
airing
the
stuff
shutting
up
of
the
house
burial
of
the
dead
forbidding
infected
stuff
to
be
sold
and
of
persons
leaving
infected
houses
marking
of
infected
houses
and
regulating
hackney
coaches
that
have
been
used
to
convey
infected
persons
lastly
there
followed
for
cleansing
and
keeping
the
streets
and
houses
and
concerning
loose
persons
and
idle
such
as
beggars
plays
feasts
and
signed
sir
john
lawrence
sir
george
waterman
sir
charles
doe
i
need
not
say
that
these
orders
extended
only
to
such
places
as
were
within
the
lord
mayor
jurisdiction
so
it
is
requisite
to
observe
that
the
justices
of
the
peace
within
those
parishes
and
those
places
called
the
hamlets
and
took
the
same
method
as
i
remember
the
orders
for
shutting
up
of
houses
did
not
take
place
so
soon
on
our
side
because
as
i
said
before
the
plague
did
not
reach
the
eastern
parts
of
the
town
at
least
not
begin
to
be
very
violent
till
the
beginning
of
august
now
indeed
it
was
coming
on
amain
for
the
burials
that
same
week
were
in
the
next
adjoining
parishes
thus
the
next
week
to
the
prodigiously
of
increased
as
thus
leonard
shoreditch
botolph
bishopsgate
giles
cripplegate
the
shutting
up
of
houses
was
at
first
considered
a
very
cruel
and
unchristian
thing
and
the
poor
people
so
confined
made
bitter
lamentations
complaints
were
also
daily
brought
to
my
lord
mayor
of
houses
causelessly
and
some
maliciously
shut
up
i
can
not
say
but
upon
inquiry
many
that
complained
so
loudly
were
found
in
a
condition
to
be
continued
and
others
again
inspection
being
made
upon
the
sick
person
on
his
being
content
to
be
carried
to
the
pesthouse
were
released
indeed
many
people
perished
in
these
miserable
confinements
which
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
would
not
have
been
distempered
if
they
had
had
liberty
though
the
plague
was
in
the
house
at
which
the
people
were
at
first
very
clamorous
and
uneasy
and
several
acts
of
violence
were
committed
on
the
men
who
were
set
to
watch
the
houses
so
shut
up
also
several
people
broke
out
by
force
in
many
places
as
i
shall
observe
by
and
by
still
it
was
a
public
good
that
justified
the
private
mischief
and
there
was
no
obtaining
the
least
mitigation
by
any
application
to
magistrates
this
put
the
people
upon
all
manner
of
stratagems
in
order
if
possible
to
get
out
and
it
would
fill
a
little
volume
to
set
down
the
arts
used
by
the
people
of
such
houses
to
shut
the
eyes
of
the
watchmen
who
were
employed
to
deceive
them
and
to
escape
or
break
out
from
them
a
few
incidents
on
this
head
may
prove
not
uninteresting
as
i
went
along
houndsditch
one
morning
about
eight
there
was
a
great
noise
it
is
true
indeed
there
was
not
much
crowd
because
people
were
not
very
free
to
gather
or
to
stay
long
together
but
the
outcry
was
loud
enough
to
prompt
my
curiosity
and
i
called
to
one
that
looked
out
of
a
window
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
a
watchman
it
seems
had
been
employed
to
keep
his
post
at
the
door
of
a
house
which
was
infected
or
said
to
be
infected
and
was
shut
up
he
had
been
there
all
night
for
two
nights
together
as
he
told
his
story
and
the
day
watchman
had
been
there
one
day
and
had
now
come
to
relieve
him
all
this
while
no
noise
had
been
heard
in
the
house
no
light
had
been
seen
they
called
for
nothing
sent
him
no
errands
which
was
the
chief
business
of
the
watchman
neither
had
they
given
him
any
disturbance
as
he
said
from
the
monday
afternoon
when
he
heard
great
crying
and
screaming
in
the
house
which
as
he
supposed
was
occasioned
by
some
of
the
family
dying
just
at
that
time
it
seems
the
night
before
the
as
it
was
called
had
been
stopped
there
and
a
had
been
brought
down
to
the
door
dead
and
the
buriers
or
bearers
as
they
were
called
put
her
into
the
cart
wrapped
only
in
a
green
rug
and
carried
her
away
the
watchman
had
knocked
at
the
door
it
seems
when
he
heard
that
noise
and
crying
as
above
and
nobody
answered
a
great
while
but
at
last
one
looked
out
and
said
with
an
angry
quick
tone
what
do
ye
want
that
ye
make
such
a
knocking
he
answered
i
am
the
watchman
how
do
you
do
what
is
the
matter
the
person
answered
what
is
that
to
you
stop
the
this
it
seems
was
about
one
soon
after
as
the
fellow
said
he
stopped
the
and
then
knocked
again
but
nobody
answered
he
continued
knocking
and
the
bellman
called
out
several
times
bring
out
your
dead
but
nobody
answered
till
the
man
that
drove
the
cart
being
called
to
other
houses
would
stay
no
longer
and
drove
away
the
watchman
knew
not
what
to
make
of
all
this
so
he
let
them
alone
till
the
day
watchman
came
to
relieve
him
giving
him
an
account
of
the
particulars
they
knocked
at
the
door
a
great
while
but
nobody
answered
and
they
observed
that
the
window
or
casement
at
which
the
person
had
looked
out
continued
open
being
up
two
pair
of
stairs
upon
this
the
two
men
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
got
a
long
ladder
and
one
of
them
went
up
to
the
window
and
looked
into
the
room
where
he
saw
a
woman
lying
dead
upon
the
floor
in
a
dismal
manner
having
no
clothes
on
her
but
her
shift
although
he
called
aloud
and
knocked
hard
on
the
floor
with
his
long
staff
yet
nobody
stirred
or
answered
neither
could
he
hear
any
noise
in
the
house
upon
this
he
came
down
again
and
acquainted
his
fellow
who
went
up
also
and
finding
the
case
as
above
they
resolved
either
to
acquaint
the
lord
mayor
or
some
other
magistrate
with
it
the
magistrate
it
seems
upon
the
information
of
the
two
men
ordered
the
house
to
be
broken
open
a
constable
and
other
persons
being
appointed
to
be
present
that
nothing
might
be
plundered
and
accordingly
it
was
so
done
when
nobody
was
found
in
the
house
but
that
young
woman
who
having
been
infected
and
past
recovery
the
rest
had
left
her
to
die
by
herself
everyone
was
gone
having
found
some
way
to
delude
the
watchman
and
to
get
open
the
door
or
get
out
at
some
back
door
or
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
so
that
he
knew
nothing
of
it
and
as
to
those
cries
and
shrieks
which
the
watchman
had
heard
it
was
supposed
they
were
the
passionate
cries
of
the
family
at
the
bitter
parting
which
to
be
sure
it
was
to
them
all
this
being
the
sister
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
many
such
escapes
were
made
out
of
infected
houses
as
particularly
when
the
watchman
was
sent
some
errand
that
is
to
say
for
necessaries
such
as
food
and
physic
to
fetch
physicians
if
they
would
come
or
surgeons
or
nurses
or
to
order
the
and
the
like
now
when
he
went
it
was
his
duty
to
lock
up
the
outer
door
of
the
house
and
take
the
key
away
with
him
but
to
evade
this
and
cheat
the
watchman
people
got
two
or
three
keys
made
to
their
locks
or
they
found
means
to
unscrew
the
locks
open
the
door
and
go
out
as
they
pleased
this
way
of
escape
being
found
out
the
officers
afterward
had
orders
to
padlock
up
the
doors
on
the
outside
and
place
bolts
on
them
as
they
thought
fit
at
another
house
as
i
was
informed
in
the
street
near
aldgate
a
whole
family
was
shut
up
and
locked
in
because
the
maidservant
was
ill
the
master
of
the
house
had
complained
by
his
friends
to
the
next
alderman
and
to
the
lord
mayor
and
had
consented
to
have
the
maid
carried
to
the
pesthouse
but
was
refused
so
the
door
was
marked
with
a
red
cross
a
padlock
on
the
outside
as
above
and
a
watchman
set
to
keep
the
door
according
to
public
order
after
the
master
of
the
house
found
there
was
no
remedy
but
that
he
his
wife
and
his
children
were
to
be
locked
up
with
this
poor
distempered
servant
he
called
to
the
watchman
and
told
him
he
must
go
then
and
fetch
a
nurse
for
them
to
attend
this
poor
girl
for
that
it
would
be
certain
death
to
them
all
to
oblige
them
to
nurse
her
and
that
if
he
would
not
do
this
the
maid
must
perish
either
of
the
distemper
or
be
starved
for
want
of
food
for
he
was
resolved
none
of
his
family
should
go
near
her
and
she
lay
in
the
garret
high
where
she
could
not
cry
out
or
call
to
anybody
for
help
the
watchman
went
and
fetched
a
nurse
as
he
was
appointed
and
brought
her
to
them
the
same
evening
during
this
interval
the
master
of
the
house
took
the
opportunity
of
breaking
a
large
hole
through
his
shop
into
a
stall
where
formerly
a
cobbler
had
sat
before
or
under
his
shop
window
but
the
tenant
as
may
be
supposed
at
such
a
dismal
time
as
that
was
dead
or
removed
and
so
he
had
the
key
in
his
own
keeping
having
made
his
way
into
this
stall
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
the
man
had
been
at
the
door
the
noise
he
was
obliged
to
make
being
such
as
would
have
alarmed
the
watchman
i
say
having
made
his
way
into
this
stall
he
sat
still
till
the
watchman
returned
with
the
nurse
and
all
the
next
day
also
but
the
night
following
having
contrived
to
send
the
watchman
another
trifling
errand
he
conveyed
himself
and
all
his
family
out
of
the
house
and
left
the
nurse
and
the
watchman
to
bury
the
poor
woman
that
is
to
throw
her
into
the
cart
and
take
care
of
the
house
i
could
give
a
great
many
such
stories
as
these
which
in
the
long
course
of
that
dismal
year
i
met
with
that
is
heard
of
and
which
are
very
certain
to
be
true
or
very
near
the
truth
that
is
to
say
true
in
general
for
no
man
could
at
such
a
time
learn
all
the
particulars
there
was
likewise
violence
used
with
the
watchmen
as
was
reported
in
abundance
of
places
and
i
believe
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
visitation
to
the
end
not
less
than
eighteen
or
twenty
of
them
were
killed
or
so
severely
wounded
as
to
be
taken
up
for
dead
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
done
by
the
people
in
the
infected
houses
which
were
shut
up
and
where
they
attempted
to
come
out
and
were
opposed
for
example
not
far
from
coleman
street
they
blowed
up
a
watchman
with
gunpowder
and
burned
the
poor
fellow
dreadfully
and
while
he
made
hideous
cries
and
nobody
would
venture
to
come
near
to
help
him
the
whole
family
that
were
able
to
stir
got
out
at
the
windows
one
story
high
two
that
were
left
sick
calling
out
for
help
care
was
taken
to
give
the
latter
nurses
to
look
after
them
but
the
fugitives
were
not
found
till
after
the
plague
abated
when
they
returned
but
as
nothing
could
be
proved
so
nothing
could
be
done
to
them
it
is
to
be
considered
too
that
as
these
were
prisons
without
bars
or
bolts
which
our
common
prisons
are
furnished
with
so
the
people
let
themselves
down
out
of
their
windows
even
in
the
face
of
the
watchman
bringing
swords
or
pistols
in
their
hands
and
threatening
to
shoot
the
poor
wretch
if
he
stirred
or
called
for
help
in
other
cases
some
had
gardens
and
walls
or
palings
between
them
and
their
neighbors
or
yards
and
back
houses
and
these
by
friendship
and
entreaties
would
get
leave
to
get
over
those
walls
or
palings
and
so
go
out
at
their
neighbors
doors
or
by
giving
money
to
their
servants
get
them
to
let
them
through
in
the
night
so
that
in
short
the
shutting
up
of
houses
was
in
no
wise
to
be
depended
upon
neither
did
it
answer
the
end
at
all
serving
more
to
make
the
people
desperate
and
drive
them
to
violent
extremities
in
their
attempts
to
break
out
but
what
was
still
worse
those
that
did
thus
break
out
spread
the
infection
by
wandering
about
with
the
distemper
upon
them
and
many
that
did
so
were
driven
to
dreadful
exigencies
and
extremities
and
perished
in
the
streets
or
fields
or
dropped
down
with
the
raging
violence
of
the
fever
upon
them
others
wandered
into
the
country
and
went
forward
any
way
as
their
desperation
guided
them
not
knowing
whither
they
went
or
would
go
till
faint
and
tired
the
houses
and
villages
on
the
road
refusing
to
admit
them
to
lodge
whether
infected
or
no
they
perished
by
the
roadside
on
the
other
hand
when
the
plague
at
first
seized
a
family
that
is
to
say
when
any
one
of
the
family
had
gone
out
and
unwarily
or
otherwise
caught
the
distemper
and
brought
it
home
it
was
certainly
known
by
the
family
before
it
was
known
to
the
officers
who
were
appointed
to
examine
into
the
circumstances
of
all
sick
persons
when
they
heard
of
their
being
sick
i
remember
and
while
i
am
writing
this
story
i
think
i
hear
the
very
shrieks
a
certain
lady
had
an
only
daughter
a
young
maiden
about
nineteen
years
old
and
who
was
possessed
of
a
very
considerable
fortune
the
young
woman
her
mother
and
the
maid
had
been
out
for
some
purpose
for
the
house
was
not
shut
up
but
about
two
hours
after
they
came
home
the
young
lady
complained
she
was
not
well
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
she
vomited
and
had
a
violent
pain
in
her
head
pray
god
says
her
mother
in
a
terrible
fright
my
child
has
not
the
distemper
the
pain
in
her
head
increasing
her
mother
ordered
the
bed
to
be
warmed
and
resolved
to
put
her
to
bed
and
prepared
to
give
her
things
to
sweat
which
was
the
ordinary
remedy
to
be
taken
when
the
first
apprehensions
of
the
distemper
began
while
the
bed
was
being
aired
the
mother
undressed
the
young
woman
and
on
looking
over
her
body
with
a
candle
immediately
discovered
the
fatal
tokens
her
mother
not
being
able
to
contain
herself
threw
down
her
candle
and
screeched
out
in
such
a
frightful
manner
that
it
was
enough
to
bring
horror
upon
the
stoutest
heart
in
the
world
overcome
by
fright
she
first
fainted
then
recovered
then
ran
all
over
the
house
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
stairs
like
one
distracted
thus
she
continued
screeching
and
crying
out
for
several
hours
void
of
all
sense
or
at
least
government
of
her
senses
and
as
i
was
told
never
came
thoroughly
to
herself
again
as
to
the
young
maiden
she
was
dead
from
that
moment
for
the
gangrene
which
occasions
the
spots
had
spread
over
her
whole
body
and
she
died
in
less
than
two
hours
but
still
the
mother
continued
crying
out
not
knowing
anything
more
of
her
child
several
hours
after
she
was
dead
i
went
all
the
first
part
of
the
time
freely
about
the
streets
though
not
so
freely
as
to
run
myself
into
apparent
danger
except
when
they
dug
the
great
pit
in
the
of
our
parish
of
aldgate
a
terrible
pit
it
was
and
i
could
not
resist
the
curiosity
to
go
and
see
it
so
far
as
i
could
judge
it
was
about
forty
feet
in
length
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
broad
and
at
the
time
i
first
looked
at
it
about
nine
feet
deep
but
it
was
said
they
dug
it
nearly
twenty
feet
deep
afterward
when
they
could
go
no
deeper
for
the
water
they
had
dug
several
pits
in
another
ground
when
the
distemper
began
to
spread
in
our
parish
and
especially
when
the
began
to
go
about
which
in
our
parish
was
not
till
the
beginning
of
august
into
these
pits
they
had
put
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
bodies
each
then
they
made
larger
holes
wherein
they
buried
all
that
the
cart
brought
in
a
week
which
by
the
middle
to
the
end
of
august
came
to
from
two
hundred
to
four
hundred
a
week
they
could
not
dig
them
larger
because
of
the
order
of
the
magistrates
confining
them
to
leave
no
bodies
within
six
feet
of
the
surface
besides
the
water
coming
on
at
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
feet
they
could
not
well
put
more
in
one
pit
but
now
at
the
beginning
of
september
the
plague
being
at
its
height
and
the
number
of
burials
in
our
parish
increasing
to
more
than
were
ever
buried
in
any
parish
about
london
of
no
larger
extent
they
ordered
this
dreadful
gulf
to
be
dug
for
such
it
was
rather
than
a
pit
they
had
supposed
this
pit
would
have
supplied
them
for
a
month
or
more
when
they
dug
it
and
some
blamed
the
churchwardens
for
suffering
such
a
frightful
thing
telling
them
they
were
making
preparations
to
bury
the
whole
parish
and
the
like
but
time
made
it
appear
the
knew
the
condition
of
the
parish
better
than
they
did
for
the
pit
being
finished
september
i
think
they
began
to
bury
in
it
on
the
and
by
the
which
was
just
two
weeks
they
had
thrown
into
it
one
thousand
one
hundred
fourteen
bodies
when
they
were
obliged
to
fill
it
up
the
bodies
being
within
six
feet
of
the
surface
it
was
about
september
that
my
curiosity
led
or
rather
drove
me
to
go
and
see
this
pit
again
when
there
had
been
about
four
hundred
people
buried
in
it
and
i
was
not
content
to
see
it
in
the
daytime
as
i
had
done
before
for
then
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
see
but
the
loose
earth
for
all
the
bodies
that
were
thrown
in
were
immediately
covered
with
earth
by
those
they
called
the
buriers
but
i
resolved
to
go
in
the
night
and
see
some
of
the
bodies
thrown
in
there
was
a
strict
order
against
people
coming
to
those
pits
and
that
was
only
to
prevent
infection
but
after
some
time
that
order
was
more
necessary
for
people
that
were
infected
and
near
their
end
and
delirious
also
would
run
to
those
pits
wrapped
in
blankets
or
rags
and
throw
themselves
in
and
bury
themselves
i
got
admittance
into
the
by
being
acquainted
with
the
sexton
who
though
he
did
not
refuse
me
at
all
yet
earnestly
persuaded
me
not
to
go
telling
me
very
seriously
for
he
was
a
good
and
sensible
man
that
it
was
indeed
their
business
and
duty
to
run
all
hazards
and
that
in
so
doing
they
might
hope
to
be
preserved
but
that
i
had
no
apparent
call
except
my
own
curiosity
which
he
said
he
believed
i
would
not
pretend
was
sufficient
to
justify
my
exposing
myself
to
infection
i
told
him
i
had
been
pressed
in
my
mind
to
go
and
that
perhaps
it
might
be
an
instructing
sight
that
might
not
be
without
its
uses
nay
says
the
good
man
if
you
will
venture
on
that
score
i
name
of
god
go
in
for
depend
upon
it
be
a
sermon
to
you
it
may
be
the
best
that
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
it
is
a
speaking
sight
says
he
and
has
a
voice
with
it
and
a
loud
one
to
call
us
to
repentance
and
with
that
he
opened
the
door
and
said
go
if
you
will
his
words
had
shocked
my
resolution
a
little
and
i
stood
wavering
for
a
good
while
but
just
at
that
interval
i
saw
two
links
come
over
from
the
end
of
the
minories
and
heard
the
bellman
and
then
appeared
a
so
i
could
no
longer
resist
my
desire
and
went
in
there
was
nobody
that
i
could
perceive
at
first
in
the
or
going
into
it
but
the
buriers
and
the
fellow
that
drove
the
cart
or
rather
led
the
horse
and
cart
but
when
they
came
up
to
the
pit
they
saw
a
man
going
to
and
fro
muffled
up
in
a
brown
cloak
and
making
motions
with
his
hands
under
his
cloak
as
if
he
was
in
a
great
agony
and
the
buriers
immediately
gathered
about
him
supposing
he
was
one
of
those
poor
delirious
or
desperate
creatures
that
used
to
bury
themselves
he
said
nothing
as
he
walked
about
but
two
or
three
times
groaned
very
deeply
and
loud
and
sighed
as
he
would
break
his
heart
when
the
buriers
came
up
to
him
they
soon
found
he
was
neither
a
person
infected
and
desperate
as
i
have
observed
above
nor
a
person
distempered
in
mind
but
one
oppressed
with
a
dreadful
weight
of
grief
indeed
having
his
wife
and
several
of
his
children
in
the
cart
that
had
just
come
in
and
he
followed
it
in
an
agony
and
excess
of
sorrow
he
mourned
heartily
as
it
was
easy
to
see
but
with
a
kind
of
masculine
grief
that
could
not
give
itself
vent
in
tears
and
calmly
desiring
the
buriers
to
let
him
alone
said
he
would
only
see
the
bodies
thrown
in
and
go
away
so
they
left
importuning
him
but
no
sooner
was
the
cart
turned
round
and
the
bodies
shot
into
the
pit
promiscuously
which
was
a
surprise
to
him
for
he
at
least
expected
they
would
have
been
decently
laid
in
though
indeed
he
was
afterward
convinced
that
was
impracticable
i
say
no
sooner
did
he
see
the
sight
but
he
cried
out
aloud
unable
to
contain
himself
i
could
not
hear
what
he
said
but
he
went
backward
and
forward
two
or
three
times
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
buriers
ran
to
him
and
took
him
up
and
in
a
little
while
he
came
to
himself
and
they
led
him
away
to
the
pye
tavern
over
against
the
end
of
houndsditch
where
it
seems
the
man
was
known
and
where
they
took
care
of
him
he
looked
into
the
pit
again
as
he
went
away
but
the
buriers
had
covered
the
bodies
so
immediately
with
throwing
in
the
earth
that
though
there
was
light
enough
for
there
were
lanterns
and
candles
placed
all
night
round
the
sides
of
the
pit
yet
nothing
could
be
seen
this
was
a
mournful
scene
indeed
and
affected
me
almost
as
much
as
the
rest
but
the
other
was
awful
and
full
of
terror
the
cart
had
in
it
sixteen
or
seventeen
bodies
some
were
wrapped
up
in
linen
sheets
some
in
rugs
some
all
but
naked
or
so
loose
that
what
covering
they
had
fell
from
them
in
being
shot
out
of
the
cart
for
coffins
were
not
to
be
had
for
the
prodigious
numbers
that
fell
in
such
a
calamity
as
his
it
was
reported
by
way
of
scandal
upon
the
buriers
that
if
any
corpse
was
delivered
to
them
decently
wrapped
in
a
the
buriers
were
so
wicked
as
to
strip
them
in
the
cart
and
carry
them
quite
naked
to
the
ground
but
as
i
can
not
easily
credit
anything
so
vile
among
christians
and
at
a
time
so
filled
with
terrors
as
that
was
i
can
only
relate
it
and
leave
it
undetermined
i
was
indeed
shocked
at
the
whole
sight
it
almost
overwhelmed
me
and
i
went
away
with
my
heart
full
of
the
most
afflicting
thoughts
such
as
i
can
not
describe
just
at
my
going
out
at
the
and
turning
up
the
street
toward
my
own
house
i
saw
another
cart
with
links
and
a
bellman
going
before
coming
out
of
harrow
alley
in
the
butcher
row
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
and
being
as
i
perceived
very
full
of
dead
bodies
it
went
directly
toward
the
church
i
stood
awhile
but
i
had
no
desire
to
go
back
again
to
see
the
same
dismal
scene
over
again
so
i
went
directly
home
where
i
could
not
but
consider
with
thankfulness
the
risk
i
had
run
here
the
poor
unhappy
gentleman
grief
came
into
my
head
again
and
indeed
i
could
not
but
shed
tears
in
reflecting
upon
it
perhaps
more
than
he
did
himself
but
his
case
lay
so
heavy
upon
my
mind
that
i
could
not
constrain
myself
from
going
again
to
the
pye
tavern
resolving
to
inquire
what
became
of
him
it
was
by
this
time
one
in
the
morning
and
the
poor
gentleman
was
still
there
the
truth
was
the
people
of
the
house
knowing
him
had
kept
him
there
all
the
night
notwithstanding
the
danger
of
being
infected
by
him
though
it
appeared
the
man
was
perfectly
sound
himself
it
is
with
regret
that
i
take
notice
of
this
tavern
the
people
were
civil
mannerly
and
obliging
enough
and
had
till
this
time
kept
their
house
open
and
their
trade
going
on
though
not
so
very
publicly
as
formerly
but
a
dreadful
set
of
fellows
frequented
their
house
who
in
the
midst
of
all
this
horror
met
there
every
night
behaved
with
all
the
revelling
and
roaring
extravagances
as
are
usual
for
such
people
to
do
at
other
times
and
indeed
to
such
an
offensive
degree
that
the
very
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
grew
first
ashamed
and
then
terrified
at
them
they
sat
generally
in
a
room
next
the
street
and
as
they
always
kept
late
hours
so
when
the
came
across
the
street
end
to
go
into
houndsditch
which
was
in
view
of
the
tavern
windows
they
would
frequently
open
the
windows
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
bell
and
look
out
at
them
and
as
they
might
often
hear
sad
lamentations
of
people
in
the
streets
or
at
their
windows
as
the
carts
went
along
they
would
make
their
impudent
mocks
and
jeers
at
them
especially
if
they
heard
the
poor
people
call
upon
god
to
have
mercy
upon
them
as
many
would
do
at
those
times
in
passing
along
the
streets
these
gentlemen
being
something
disturbed
with
the
clatter
of
bringing
the
poor
gentleman
into
the
house
as
above
were
first
angry
and
very
high
with
the
master
of
the
house
for
suffering
such
a
fellow
as
they
called
him
to
be
brought
out
of
the
grave
into
their
house
but
being
answered
that
the
man
was
a
neighbor
and
that
he
was
sound
but
overwhelmed
with
the
calamity
of
his
family
and
the
like
they
turned
their
anger
into
ridiculing
the
man
and
his
sorrow
for
his
wife
and
children
taunting
him
with
want
of
courage
to
leap
into
the
great
pit
and
go
to
heaven
as
they
jeeringly
expressed
it
along
with
them
adding
some
profane
and
blasphemous
expressions
they
were
at
this
vile
work
when
i
came
back
to
the
house
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
though
the
man
sat
still
mute
and
disconsolate
and
their
affronts
could
not
divert
his
sorrow
yet
he
was
both
grieved
and
offended
at
their
words
upon
this
i
gently
reproved
them
being
well
enough
acquainted
with
their
characters
and
not
unknown
in
person
to
two
of
them
they
immediately
fell
upon
me
with
ill
language
and
oaths
asked
me
what
i
did
out
of
my
grave
at
such
a
time
when
so
many
honester
men
were
carried
into
the
and
why
i
was
not
at
home
saying
my
prayers
till
the
came
for
me
i
was
indeed
astonished
at
the
impudence
of
the
men
though
not
at
all
discomposed
at
their
treatment
of
me
however
i
kept
my
temper
i
told
them
that
though
i
defied
them
or
any
man
in
the
world
to
tax
me
with
any
dishonesty
yet
i
acknowledged
that
in
this
terrible
judgment
of
god
many
a
better
than
i
was
swept
away
and
carried
to
his
grave
but
to
answer
their
question
directly
it
was
true
that
i
was
mercifully
preserved
by
that
great
god
whose
name
they
had
blasphemed
and
taken
in
vain
by
cursing
and
swearing
in
a
dreadful
manner
and
that
i
believed
i
was
preserved
in
particular
among
other
ends
of
his
goodness
that
i
might
reprove
them
for
their
audacious
boldness
in
behaving
in
such
a
manner
and
in
such
an
awful
time
as
this
was
especially
for
their
jeering
and
mocking
at
an
honest
gentleman
and
a
neighbor
who
they
saw
was
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
for
the
sufferings
with
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
afflict
his
family
they
received
all
reproof
with
the
utmost
contempt
and
made
the
greatest
mockery
that
was
possible
for
them
to
do
at
me
giving
me
all
the
opprobrious
insolent
scoffs
that
they
could
think
of
for
preaching
to
them
as
they
called
it
which
indeed
grieved
me
rather
than
angered
me
i
went
away
however
blessing
god
in
my
mind
that
i
had
not
spared
them
though
they
had
insulted
me
so
much
they
continued
this
wretched
course
three
or
four
days
after
this
continually
mocking
and
jeering
at
all
that
showed
themselves
religious
or
serious
or
that
were
any
way
us
and
i
was
informed
they
flouted
in
the
same
manner
at
the
good
people
who
notwithstanding
the
contagion
met
at
the
church
fasted
and
prayed
god
to
remove
his
hand
from
them
i
say
they
continued
this
dreadful
course
three
or
four
days
i
think
it
was
no
more
when
one
of
them
particularly
he
who
asked
the
poor
gentleman
what
he
did
out
of
his
grave
was
struck
with
the
plague
and
died
in
a
most
deplorable
manner
and
in
a
word
they
were
every
one
of
them
carried
into
the
great
pit
which
i
have
mentioned
above
before
it
was
quite
filled
up
which
was
not
above
a
fortnight
or
thereabout
great
fire
in
london
john
evelyn
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
merry
monarch
of
whom
one
of
his
ministers
observed
that
he
never
said
a
foolish
thing
and
never
did
a
wise
one
the
calamities
which
happened
eclipsed
the
merriment
of
his
people
if
not
that
of
the
sovereign
himself
in
england
had
not
fully
recovered
from
the
civil
wars
of
she
was
now
at
war
with
the
allied
dutch
and
french
and
was
suffering
from
the
terrible
effects
of
the
great
plague
which
ravaged
london
in
during
september
occurred
a
catastrophe
of
almost
equal
horror
a
fire
which
broke
out
in
a
baker
house
near
the
bridge
spread
on
all
sides
so
rapidly
that
the
people
were
unable
to
extinguish
it
until
of
the
city
had
been
destroyed
evelyn
account
from
his
famous
is
that
of
an
who
took
a
prominent
part
in
dealing
with
the
conflagration
during
which
the
inhabitants
of
london
like
those
of
some
of
our
cities
in
recent
times
were
reduced
to
be
spectators
of
their
own
ruin
besides
suspecting
the
french
and
dutch
of
having
landed
and
as
evelyn
records
of
firing
the
town
people
assigned
various
other
possible
origins
for
the
disaster
charging
it
upon
the
republicans
the
catholics
etc
it
was
obviously
due
as
hume
thought
it
worth
while
to
note
to
the
narrow
streets
the
houses
built
entirely
of
wood
the
dry
season
and
a
strong
east
wind
but
the
fire
says
a
later
writer
though
destroying
so
much
was
most
beneficial
in
thoroughly
eradicating
the
plague
the
fever
dens
in
which
it
continually
lurked
were
burned
and
the
new
houses
which
were
erected
were
far
more
healthy
and
better
arranged
in
the
year
of
our
lord
sept
this
fatal
night
about
ten
began
that
deplorable
fire
near
fish
street
in
london
the
fire
continuing
after
dinner
i
took
coach
with
my
wife
and
son
and
went
to
the
bankside
in
southwark
where
we
beheld
that
dismal
spectacle
the
whole
city
in
dreadful
flames
near
the
all
the
houses
from
the
bridge
all
thames
street
and
upward
toward
cheapside
down
to
the
three
cranes
were
now
consumed
the
fire
having
continued
all
this
night
if
i
may
call
that
night
which
was
as
light
as
day
for
ten
miles
round
about
after
a
dreadful
manner
when
conspiring
with
a
fierce
eastern
wind
in
a
very
dry
season
i
went
on
foot
to
the
same
place
and
saw
the
whole
south
part
of
the
city
burning
from
cheapside
to
the
thames
and
all
along
cornhill
for
it
kindled
back
against
the
wind
as
well
as
forward
tower
street
fenchurch
street
gracechurch
street
and
so
along
to
bainard
castle
and
was
now
taking
hold
of
paul
church
to
which
the
scaffolds
contributed
exceedingly
the
conflagration
was
so
universal
and
the
people
so
astonished
that
from
the
beginning
i
know
not
by
what
despondency
or
fate
they
hardly
stirred
to
quench
it
so
that
there
was
nothing
heard
or
seen
but
crying
out
and
lamentation
running
about
like
distracted
creatures
without
at
all
attempting
to
save
even
their
goods
such
a
strange
consternation
there
was
upon
them
so
as
it
burned
both
in
breadth
and
length
the
churches
public
halls
exchange
hospitals
monuments
and
ornaments
leaping
after
a
prodigious
manner
from
house
to
house
and
street
to
street
at
great
distances
one
from
the
other
for
the
heat
with
a
long
set
of
fair
and
warm
weather
had
even
ignited
the
air
and
prepared
the
materials
to
conceive
the
fire
which
devoured
after
an
incredible
manner
houses
furniture
and
everything
here
we
saw
the
thames
covered
with
goods
floating
all
the
barges
and
boats
laden
with
what
some
had
time
and
courage
to
save
as
on
the
other
the
carts
carrying
out
to
the
fields
which
for
many
miles
were
strewed
with
movables
of
all
sorts
and
tents
erecting
to
shelter
both
people
and
what
goods
they
could
get
away
oh
the
miserable
and
calamitous
spectacle
such
as
haply
the
world
had
not
seen
the
like
since
the
foundation
of
it
nor
be
outdone
till
the
universal
conflagration
all
the
sky
was
of
a
fiery
aspect
like
the
top
of
a
burning
oven
the
light
seen
above
forty
miles
round
about
for
many
nights
god
grant
my
eyes
may
never
behold
the
like
now
seeing
above
ten
thousand
houses
all
in
one
flame
the
noise
and
cracking
and
thunder
of
the
impetuous
flames
the
shrieking
of
women
and
children
the
hurry
of
people
the
fall
of
towers
houses
and
churches
was
like
a
hideous
storm
and
the
air
all
about
so
hot
and
inflamed
that
at
last
one
was
not
able
to
approach
it
so
that
they
were
forced
to
stand
still
and
let
the
flames
burn
on
which
they
did
for
near
two
miles
in
length
and
one
in
breadth
the
clouds
of
smoke
were
dismal
and
reached
upon
computation
near
fifty
miles
in
length
thus
i
left
it
this
afternoon
burning
a
resemblance
of
sodom
or
the
last
day
london
was
but
is
no
more
the
burning
still
rages
and
it
has
now
gotten
as
far
as
the
inner
temple
all
fleet
street
the
old
bailey
ludgate
hill
warwick
lane
newgate
paul
chain
watling
street
now
flaming
and
most
of
it
reduced
to
ashes
the
stones
of
paul
flew
like
granados
the
melting
lead
running
down
the
streets
in
a
stream
and
the
very
pavements
glowing
with
fiery
redness
so
as
no
horse
nor
man
was
able
to
tread
on
them
and
the
demolition
had
stopped
all
the
passages
so
that
no
help
could
be
applied
the
eastern
wind
still
more
impetuously
drove
the
flames
forward
nothing
but
the
almighty
power
of
god
was
able
to
stop
them
for
vain
was
the
help
of
man
it
crossed
toward
whitehall
oh
the
confusion
there
was
then
at
that
court
it
pleased
his
majesty
to
command
me
among
the
rest
to
look
after
the
quenching
of
fetter
lane
and
to
preserve
if
possible
that
part
of
holborn
while
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
took
their
several
posts
for
now
they
began
to
bestir
themselves
and
not
till
now
who
hitherto
had
stood
as
men
intoxicated
with
their
hands
across
and
began
to
consider
that
nothing
was
likely
to
put
a
stop
but
the
blowing
up
of
so
many
houses
might
make
a
wider
gap
than
any
had
yet
been
made
by
the
ordinary
method
of
pulling
them
down
with
engines
this
some
stout
seamen
proposed
early
enough
to
have
saved
nearly
the
whole
city
but
this
some
tenacious
and
avaricious
men
aldermen
would
not
permit
because
their
houses
must
have
been
of
the
first
it
was
therefore
now
commanded
to
be
practised
and
my
concern
being
particularly
for
the
hospital
of
bartholomew
near
smithfield
where
i
had
many
wounded
and
sick
men
made
me
the
more
diligent
to
promote
it
nor
was
my
care
for
the
savoy
less
it
now
pleased
god
by
abating
the
wind
and
by
the
industry
of
the
people
infusing
a
new
spirit
into
them
and
the
fury
of
it
began
sensibly
to
abate
about
noon
so
as
it
came
no
further
than
the
temple
westward
nor
than
the
entrance
of
smithfield
north
but
continued
all
this
day
and
night
so
impetuous
toward
cripplegate
and
the
tower
as
made
us
all
despair
it
also
broke
out
again
in
the
temple
but
the
courage
of
the
multitude
persisting
and
many
houses
being
blown
up
such
gaps
and
desolations
were
soon
made
as
with
the
former
consumption
the
back
fire
did
not
so
vehemently
urge
upon
the
rest
as
formerly
there
was
yet
no
standing
near
the
burning
and
glowing
ruins
by
near
a
furlong
space
the
coal
and
wood
wharfs
and
magazines
of
oil
resin
did
infinite
mischief
so
as
the
invective
which
a
little
before
i
had
dedicated
to
his
majesty
and
published
giving
warning
what
might
probably
be
the
issue
of
suffering
those
shops
to
be
in
the
city
was
looked
on
as
a
prophecy
the
poor
inhabitants
were
dispersed
about
george
fields
and
moorfields
as
far
as
highgate
and
several
miles
in
circle
some
under
tents
some
under
miserable
huts
and
hovels
many
without
a
rag
or
any
necessary
utensils
bed
or
board
who
from
delicateness
riches
and
easy
accommodations
in
stately
and
houses
were
now
reduced
to
extremest
misery
and
poverty
in
this
calamitous
condition
i
returned
with
a
sad
heart
to
my
house
blessing
and
adoring
the
mercy
of
god
to
me
and
mine
who
in
the
midst
of
all
this
ruin
was
like
lot
in
my
little
zoar
safe
and
sound
i
went
this
morning
on
foot
from
whitehall
as
far
as
london
bridge
through
the
late
fleet
street
ludgate
hill
by
paul
cheapside
exchange
bishopsgate
aldersgate
and
out
to
moorfields
thence
through
cornhill
with
extraordinary
difficulty
clambering
over
heaps
of
yet
smoking
rubbish
and
frequently
mistaking
where
i
was
the
ground
under
my
feet
was
so
hot
that
it
even
burned
the
soles
of
my
shoes
in
the
mean
time
his
majesty
got
to
the
tower
by
water
to
demolish
the
houses
about
the
graff
which
being
built
entirely
about
it
had
they
taken
fire
and
attacked
the
white
tower
where
the
magazine
of
powder
lay
would
undoubtedly
not
only
have
beaten
down
and
destroyed
all
the
bridge
but
sunk
and
torn
the
vessels
in
the
river
and
rendered
the
demolition
beyond
all
expression
for
several
miles
about
the
country
at
my
return
i
was
infinitely
concerned
to
find
that
goodly
church
paul
now
a
sad
ruin
and
that
beautiful
portico
or
structure
comparable
to
any
in
europe
as
not
long
before
repaired
by
the
king
now
rent
in
pieces
flakes
of
vast
stones
split
asunder
and
nothing
remaining
entire
but
the
inscription
in
the
architrave
showing
by
whom
it
was
built
which
had
not
one
letter
of
it
defaced
it
was
astonishing
to
see
what
immense
stones
the
heat
had
in
a
manner
calcined
so
that
all
the
ornaments
columns
friezes
and
projectures
of
massy
portland
stone
flew
off
even
to
the
very
roof
where
a
sheet
of
lead
covering
a
great
space
was
totally
melted
the
ruins
of
the
vaulted
roof
falling
broke
into
st
faith
which
being
filled
with
the
magazines
of
books
belonging
to
the
stationers
and
carried
thither
for
safety
they
were
all
consumed
burning
for
a
week
following
it
is
also
observable
that
the
lead
over
the
altar
at
the
east
end
was
untouched
and
among
the
divers
monuments
the
body
of
one
bishop
remained
entire
thus
lay
in
ashes
that
most
venerable
church
one
of
the
most
ancient
pieces
of
early
piety
in
the
christian
world
besides
near
one
hundred
more
the
lead
ironwork
bells
plate
melted
the
exquisitely
wrought
mercer
chapel
the
sumptuous
exchange
the
august
fabric
of
christ
church
all
the
rest
of
the
companies
halls
sumptuous
buildings
arches
all
in
dust
the
fountains
dried
up
and
ruined
while
the
very
waters
remained
boiling
the
of
subterranean
cellars
wells
and
dungeons
formerly
warehouses
still
burning
in
stench
and
dark
clouds
of
smoke
so
that
in
five
or
six
miles
traversing
about
i
did
not
see
one
load
of
timber
consume
nor
many
stones
but
what
were
calcined
white
as
snow
the
people
who
now
walked
about
the
ruins
appeared
like
men
in
a
dismal
desert
or
rather
in
some
great
city
laid
waste
by
a
cruel
enemy
to
which
was
added
the
stench
that
came
from
some
poor
creatures
bodies
beds
etc
sir
thomas
gresham
statue
though
fallen
from
its
niche
in
the
royal
exchange
remained
entire
when
all
those
of
the
kings
since
the
conquest
were
broken
to
pieces
also
the
standard
in
cornhill
and
queen
effigies
with
some
arms
on
ludgate
continued
with
but
little
detriment
while
the
vast
iron
chains
of
the
city
streets
hinges
bars
and
gates
of
prisons
were
many
of
them
melted
and
reduced
to
cinders
by
the
vehement
heat
i
was
not
able
to
pass
through
any
of
the
narrow
streets
but
kept
the
widest
the
ground
and
air
smoke
and
fiery
vapor
continued
so
intense
that
my
hair
was
almost
singed
and
my
feet
insufferably
surheated
the
and
narrower
streets
were
quite
filled
up
with
rubbish
nor
could
one
have
known
where
he
was
but
by
the
ruins
of
some
church
or
hall
that
had
some
remarkable
tower
or
pinnacle
remaining
i
then
went
toward
islington
and
highgate
where
one
might
have
seen
two
hundred
thousand
people
of
all
ranks
and
degrees
dispersed
and
lying
along
by
their
heaps
of
what
they
could
save
from
the
fire
deploring
their
loss
and
though
ready
to
perish
for
hunger
and
destitution
yet
not
asking
one
penny
for
relief
which
to
me
appeared
a
stranger
sight
than
any
i
had
yet
beheld
his
majesty
and
council
indeed
took
all
imaginable
care
for
their
relief
by
proclamation
for
the
country
to
come
in
and
refresh
them
with
provisions
in
the
midst
of
all
this
calamity
and
confusion
there
was
i
know
not
how
an
alarm
begun
that
the
french
and
dutch
with
whom
we
are
now
in
hostility
were
not
only
landed
but
even
entering
the
city
there
was
in
truth
some
days
before
great
suspicion
of
these
two
nations
joining
and
now
that
they
had
been
the
occasion
of
firing
the
town
this
report
did
so
terrify
that
on
a
sudden
there
was
such
an
uproar
and
tumult
that
they
ran
from
their
goods
and
taking
what
weapons
they
could
come
at
they
could
not
be
stopped
from
falling
on
some
of
those
nations
whom
they
casually
met
without
sense
or
reason
the
clamor
and
peril
grew
so
excessive
that
it
made
the
whole
court
amazed
and
they
did
with
infinite
pains
and
great
difficulty
reduce
and
appease
the
people
sending
troops
of
soldiers
and
guards
to
cause
them
to
retire
into
the
fields
again
where
they
were
watched
all
this
night
i
left
them
pretty
quiet
and
came
home
sufficiently
weary
and
broken
their
spirits
thus
a
little
calmed
and
the
affright
abated
they
now
began
to
repair
into
the
suburbs
about
the
city
where
such
as
had
friends
or
opportunity
got
shelter
for
the
present
to
which
his
majesty
proclamation
also
invited
them
discovery
of
gravitation
sir
david
brewster
many
admirers
of
sir
isaac
newton
have
asserted
that
his
was
the
most
gigantic
intellect
ever
bestowed
on
man
he
discovered
the
law
of
gravitation
and
by
it
explained
all
the
broader
phenomena
of
nature
such
as
the
movements
of
the
planets
the
shape
and
revolution
of
the
earth
the
succession
of
the
tides
copernicus
had
asserted
that
the
planets
moved
newton
demonstrated
it
mathematically
his
discoveries
in
optics
were
in
his
own
time
almost
equally
famous
while
in
his
later
life
he
shared
with
leibnitz
the
honor
of
inventing
the
infinitesimal
calculus
a
method
which
lies
at
the
root
of
all
the
intricate
marvels
of
modern
mathematical
science
newton
should
not
however
be
regarded
as
an
isolated
phenomenon
a
genius
but
for
whom
the
world
would
have
remained
in
darkness
his
first
flashing
idea
of
gravitation
deserves
perhaps
to
be
called
an
inspiration
but
in
all
his
other
labors
experimental
as
well
as
mathematical
he
was
but
following
the
spirit
of
the
times
the
love
of
science
was
abroad
and
its
infinite
curiosity
each
of
newton
discoveries
was
claimed
also
by
other
men
who
had
been
working
along
similar
lines
of
the
dispute
over
the
gravitation
theory
sir
david
brewster
the
great
authority
for
the
career
of
newton
gives
some
account
the
controversy
over
the
calculus
was
even
more
bitter
and
prolonged
it
were
well
however
to
disabuse
one
mind
of
the
idea
that
work
was
a
finality
that
it
settled
anything
as
to
why
the
law
of
gravitation
exists
why
bodies
tend
to
come
together
the
philosopher
had
little
suggestion
to
offer
and
the
present
generation
knows
no
more
than
he
before
copernicus
and
newton
men
looked
only
with
their
eyes
and
accepted
the
apparent
movements
of
sun
and
stars
as
real
now
going
one
step
deeper
we
look
with
our
brains
and
see
their
real
movements
which
underlie
appearances
newton
supplied
us
with
the
law
and
rate
of
the
movement
but
not
its
cause
it
is
toward
that
cause
that
great
why
that
science
has
ever
since
been
dimly
groping
in
the
year
when
the
plague
had
driven
newton
from
cambridge
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
garden
at
woolsthrope
and
reflecting
on
the
nature
of
gravity
that
remarkable
power
which
causes
all
bodies
to
descend
toward
the
centre
of
the
earth
as
this
power
is
not
found
to
suffer
any
sensible
diminution
at
the
greatest
distance
from
the
earth
centre
to
which
we
can
reach
being
as
powerful
at
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
as
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
mines
he
conceived
it
highly
probable
that
it
must
extend
much
further
than
was
usually
supposed
no
sooner
had
this
happy
conjecture
occurred
to
his
mind
than
he
considered
what
would
be
the
effect
of
its
extending
as
far
as
the
moon
that
her
motion
must
be
influenced
by
such
a
power
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
and
a
little
reflection
convinced
him
that
it
might
be
sufficient
for
retaining
that
luminary
in
her
orbit
round
the
earth
though
the
force
of
gravity
suffers
no
sensible
diminution
at
those
small
distances
from
the
earth
centre
at
which
we
can
place
ourselves
yet
he
thought
it
very
possible
that
at
the
distance
of
the
moon
it
might
differ
much
in
strength
from
what
it
is
on
the
earth
in
order
to
form
some
estimate
of
the
degree
of
its
diminution
he
considered
that
if
the
moon
be
retained
in
her
orbit
by
the
force
of
gravity
the
primary
planets
must
also
be
carried
round
the
sun
by
the
same
power
and
by
comparing
the
periods
of
the
different
planets
with
their
distances
from
the
sun
he
found
that
if
they
were
retained
in
their
orbits
by
any
power
like
gravity
its
force
must
decrease
in
the
duplicate
proportion
or
as
the
squares
of
their
distances
from
the
sun
in
drawing
this
conclusion
he
supposed
the
planets
to
move
in
orbits
perfectly
circular
and
having
the
sun
in
their
centre
having
thus
obtained
the
law
of
the
force
by
which
the
planets
were
drawn
to
the
sun
his
next
object
was
to
ascertain
if
such
a
force
emanating
from
the
earth
and
directed
to
the
moon
was
sufficient
when
diminished
in
the
duplicate
ratio
of
the
distance
to
retain
her
in
her
orbit
in
performing
this
calculation
it
was
necessary
to
compare
the
space
through
which
heavy
bodies
fall
in
a
second
at
a
given
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
at
its
surface
with
the
space
through
which
the
moon
as
it
were
falls
to
the
earth
in
a
second
of
time
while
revolving
in
a
circular
orbit
being
at
a
distance
from
books
when
he
made
this
computation
he
adopted
the
common
estimate
of
the
earth
diameter
then
in
use
among
geographers
and
navigators
and
supposed
that
each
degree
of
latitude
contained
sixty
english
miles
in
this
way
he
found
that
the
force
which
retains
the
moon
in
her
orbit
as
deduced
from
the
force
which
occasions
the
fall
of
heavy
bodies
to
the
earth
surface
was
greater
than
that
which
is
actually
observed
in
her
circular
orbit
this
difference
threw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
speculations
but
unwilling
to
abandon
what
seemed
to
be
otherwise
so
plausible
he
endeavored
to
account
for
the
difference
of
the
two
forces
by
supposing
that
some
other
cause
must
have
been
united
with
the
force
of
gravity
in
producing
so
great
velocity
of
the
moon
in
her
circular
orbit
as
this
new
cause
however
was
beyond
the
reach
of
observation
he
discontinued
all
further
inquiries
into
the
subject
and
concealed
from
his
friends
the
speculations
in
which
he
had
been
employed
after
his
return
to
cambridge
in
his
attention
was
occupied
with
optical
discoveries
but
he
had
no
sooner
brought
them
to
a
close
than
his
mind
reverted
to
the
great
subject
of
the
planetary
motions
upon
the
death
of
oldenburg
in
august
hooke
was
appointed
secretary
to
the
royal
society
and
as
this
learned
body
had
requested
the
opinion
of
newton
about
a
system
of
physical
astronomy
he
addressed
a
letter
to
hooke
on
november
in
this
letter
he
proposed
a
direct
experiment
for
verifying
the
motion
of
the
earth
by
observing
whether
or
not
bodies
that
fall
from
a
considerable
height
descend
in
a
vertical
direction
for
if
the
earth
were
at
rest
the
body
would
describe
exactly
a
vertical
line
whereas
if
it
revolved
round
its
axis
the
falling
body
must
deviate
from
the
vertical
line
toward
the
east
the
royal
society
attached
great
value
to
the
idea
thus
casually
suggested
and
hooke
was
appointed
to
put
it
to
the
test
of
experiment
being
thus
led
to
consider
the
subject
more
attentively
he
wrote
to
newton
that
wherever
the
direction
of
gravity
was
oblique
to
the
axis
on
which
the
earth
revolved
that
is
in
every
part
of
the
earth
except
the
equator
falling
bodies
should
approach
to
the
equator
and
the
deviation
from
the
vertical
in
place
of
being
exactly
to
the
east
as
newton
maintained
should
be
to
the
southeast
of
the
point
from
which
the
body
began
to
move
newton
acknowledged
that
this
conclusion
was
correct
in
theory
and
hooke
is
said
to
have
given
an
experimental
demonstration
of
it
before
the
royal
society
in
december
newton
had
erroneously
concluded
that
the
path
of
the
falling
body
would
be
a
spiral
but
hooke
on
the
same
occasion
on
which
he
made
the
preceding
experiment
read
a
paper
to
the
society
in
which
he
proved
that
the
path
of
the
body
would
be
an
eccentric
ellipse
and
an
if
the
body
moved
in
a
resisting
medium
this
correction
of
newton
error
and
the
discovery
that
a
projectile
would
move
in
an
elliptical
orbit
when
under
the
influence
of
a
force
varying
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
square
of
the
distance
led
newton
as
he
himself
informs
us
in
his
letter
to
halley
to
discover
the
theorem
by
which
he
afterward
examined
the
ellipsis
and
to
demonstrate
the
celebrated
proposition
that
a
planet
acted
upon
by
an
attractive
force
varying
inversely
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
will
describe
an
elliptical
orbit
in
one
of
whose
the
attractive
force
resides
but
though
newton
had
thus
discovered
the
true
cause
of
all
the
celestial
motions
he
did
not
yet
possess
any
evidence
that
such
a
force
actually
resided
in
the
sun
and
planets
the
failure
of
his
former
attempt
to
identify
the
law
of
falling
bodies
at
the
earth
surface
with
that
which
guided
the
moon
in
her
orbit
threw
a
doubt
over
all
his
speculations
and
prevented
him
from
giving
any
account
of
them
to
the
public
an
accident
however
of
a
very
interesting
nature
induced
him
to
resume
his
former
inquiries
and
enabled
him
to
bring
them
to
a
close
in
june
when
he
was
attending
a
meeting
of
the
royal
society
of
london
the
measurement
of
a
degree
of
the
meridian
executed
by
picard
in
became
the
subject
of
conversation
newton
took
a
memorandum
of
the
result
obtained
by
the
french
astronomer
and
having
deduced
from
it
the
diameter
of
the
earth
he
immediately
resumed
his
calculation
of
and
began
to
repeat
it
with
these
new
data
in
the
progress
of
the
calculation
he
saw
that
the
result
which
he
had
formerly
expected
was
likely
to
be
produced
and
he
was
thrown
into
such
a
state
of
nervous
irritability
that
he
was
unable
to
carry
on
the
calculation
in
this
state
of
mind
he
intrusted
it
to
one
of
his
friends
and
he
had
the
high
satisfaction
of
finding
his
former
views
amply
realized
the
force
of
gravity
which
regulated
the
fall
of
bodies
at
the
earth
surface
when
diminished
as
the
square
of
the
moon
distance
from
the
earth
was
found
to
be
almost
exactly
equal
to
the
centrifugal
force
of
the
moon
as
deduced
from
her
observed
distance
and
velocity
the
influence
of
such
a
result
upon
such
a
mind
may
be
more
easily
conceived
than
described
the
whole
material
universe
was
spread
out
before
him
the
sun
with
all
his
attending
planets
the
planets
with
all
their
satellites
the
comets
wheeling
in
every
direction
in
their
eccentric
orbits
and
the
systems
of
the
fixed
stars
stretching
to
the
remotest
limits
of
space
all
the
varied
and
complicated
movements
of
the
heavens
in
short
must
have
been
at
once
presented
to
his
mind
as
the
necessary
result
of
that
law
which
he
had
established
in
reference
to
the
earth
and
the
moon
after
extending
this
law
to
the
other
bodies
of
the
system
he
composed
a
series
of
propositions
on
the
motion
of
the
primary
planets
about
the
sun
which
were
sent
to
london
about
the
end
of
and
were
soon
afterward
communicated
to
the
royal
society
about
this
period
other
philosophers
had
been
occupied
with
the
same
subject
sir
christopher
wren
had
many
years
before
endeavored
to
explain
the
planetary
motions
by
the
composition
of
a
descent
toward
the
sun
and
an
impressed
motion
but
he
at
length
gave
it
over
not
finding
the
means
of
doing
it
in
january
halley
had
concluded
from
law
of
the
periods
and
distances
that
the
centripetal
force
decreased
in
the
reciprocal
proportion
of
the
squares
of
the
distances
and
having
one
day
met
sir
christopher
wren
and
hooke
the
latter
affirmed
that
he
had
demonstrated
upon
that
principle
all
the
laws
of
the
celestial
motions
halley
confessed
that
his
attempts
were
unsuccessful
and
sir
christopher
in
order
to
encourage
the
inquiry
offered
to
present
a
book
of
forty
shillings
value
to
either
of
the
two
philosophers
who
should
in
the
space
of
two
months
bring
him
a
convincing
demonstration
of
it
hooke
persisted
in
the
declaration
that
he
possessed
the
method
but
avowed
it
to
be
his
intention
to
conceal
it
for
time
he
promised
however
to
show
it
to
sir
christopher
but
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
this
promise
was
never
fulfilled
in
august
halley
went
to
cambridge
for
the
express
purpose
of
consulting
newton
on
this
interesting
subject
newton
assured
him
that
he
had
brought
this
demonstration
to
perfection
and
promised
him
a
copy
of
it
this
copy
was
received
in
november
by
the
doctor
who
made
a
second
visit
to
cambridge
in
order
to
induce
its
author
to
have
it
inserted
in
the
register
book
of
the
society
on
december
halley
announced
to
the
society
that
he
had
seen
at
cambridge
newton
treatise
motu
which
he
had
promised
to
send
to
the
society
to
be
entered
upon
their
register
and
halley
was
desired
to
unite
with
paget
master
of
the
mathematical
school
in
christ
hospital
in
reminding
newton
of
his
promise
for
securing
the
invention
to
himself
till
such
time
as
he
can
be
at
leisure
to
publish
it
on
february
aston
the
secretary
communicated
a
letter
from
newton
in
which
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
enter
in
the
register
his
notions
about
motion
and
his
intentions
to
fit
them
suddenly
for
the
press
the
progress
of
his
work
was
however
interrupted
by
a
visit
of
five
or
six
weeks
which
he
made
in
lincolnshire
but
he
proceeded
with
such
diligence
on
his
return
that
he
was
able
to
transmit
the
manuscript
to
london
before
the
end
of
april
this
manuscript
entitled
naturalis
principia
and
dedicated
to
the
society
was
presented
by
vincent
on
april
when
sir
john
hoskins
the
and
the
particular
friend
of
hooke
was
in
the
chair
vincent
passed
a
just
encomium
on
the
novelty
and
dignity
of
the
subject
and
another
member
added
that
newton
had
carried
the
thing
so
far
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
added
to
these
remarks
the
replied
that
the
method
was
so
much
the
more
to
be
prized
as
it
was
both
invented
and
perfected
at
the
same
time
hooke
took
offence
at
these
remarks
and
blamed
sir
john
for
not
having
mentioned
what
he
had
discovered
to
him
but
the
did
not
seem
to
recollect
any
such
communication
and
the
consequence
of
this
discussion
was
that
these
two
who
till
then
were
the
most
inseparable
cronies
have
since
scarcely
seen
one
another
and
are
utterly
fallen
out
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
meeting
the
society
adjourned
to
the
coffee
house
where
hooke
stated
that
he
not
only
had
made
the
same
discovery
but
had
given
the
first
hint
of
it
to
newton
an
account
of
these
proceedings
was
communicated
to
newton
through
two
different
channels
in
a
letter
dated
may
halley
wrote
to
him
that
hooke
has
some
pretensions
upon
the
invention
of
the
rule
of
the
decrease
of
gravity
being
reciprocally
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
from
the
centre
he
says
you
had
the
notion
from
him
though
he
owns
the
demonstration
of
the
curves
generated
thereby
to
be
wholly
your
own
how
much
of
this
is
so
you
know
best
as
likewise
what
you
have
to
do
in
this
matter
only
hooke
seems
to
expect
you
would
make
some
mention
of
him
in
the
preface
which
it
is
possible
you
may
see
reason
to
prefix
this
communication
from
halley
induced
the
author
on
june
to
address
a
long
letter
to
him
in
which
he
gives
a
minute
and
able
refutation
of
hooke
claims
but
before
this
letter
was
despatched
another
correspondent
who
had
received
his
information
from
one
of
the
members
that
were
present
informed
newton
that
hooke
made
a
great
stir
pretending
that
he
had
all
from
him
and
desiring
they
would
see
that
he
had
justice
done
him
this
fresh
charge
seems
to
have
ruffled
the
tranquillity
of
newton
and
he
accordingly
added
an
angry
and
satirical
postscript
in
which
he
treats
hooke
with
little
ceremony
and
goes
so
far
as
to
conjecture
that
hooke
might
have
acquired
his
knowledge
of
the
law
from
a
letter
of
his
own
to
huygens
directed
to
oldenburg
and
dated
january
my
letter
to
hugenius
was
directed
to
oldenburg
who
used
to
keep
the
originals
his
papers
came
into
possession
hooke
knowing
my
hand
might
have
the
curiosity
to
look
into
that
letter
and
there
take
the
notion
of
comparing
the
forces
of
the
planets
arising
from
their
circular
motion
and
so
what
he
wrote
to
me
afterward
about
the
rate
of
gravity
might
be
nothing
but
the
fruit
of
my
own
garden
in
replying
to
this
letter
halley
assured
him
that
hooke
manner
of
claiming
the
discovery
had
been
represented
to
him
in
worse
colors
than
it
ought
and
that
he
neither
made
public
application
to
the
society
for
justice
nor
pretended
that
you
had
all
from
him
the
effect
of
this
assurance
was
to
make
newton
regret
that
he
had
written
the
angry
postscript
to
his
letter
and
in
replying
to
halley
on
july
he
not
only
expresses
his
regret
but
recounts
the
different
new
ideas
which
he
had
acquired
from
hooke
correspondence
and
suggests
it
as
the
best
method
of
compromising
the
present
dispute
to
add
a
in
which
wren
hooke
and
halley
are
acknowledged
to
have
independently
deduced
the
law
of
gravity
from
the
second
law
of
kepler
at
the
meeting
of
april
at
which
the
manuscript
of
the
was
presented
to
the
royal
society
it
was
agreed
that
the
printing
of
it
should
be
referred
to
the
council
that
a
letter
of
thanks
should
be
written
to
its
author
and
at
a
meeting
of
the
council
on
may
it
was
resolved
that
the
manuscript
should
be
printed
at
the
society
expense
and
that
halley
should
superintend
it
while
going
through
the
press
these
resolutions
were
communicated
by
halley
in
a
letter
dated
may
and
in
newton
reply
on
june
already
mentioned
he
makes
the
following
observations
the
proof
you
sent
me
i
like
very
well
i
designed
the
whole
to
consist
of
three
books
the
second
was
finished
last
summer
being
short
and
only
wants
transcribing
and
drawing
the
cuts
fairly
some
new
propositions
i
have
since
thought
on
which
i
can
as
well
let
alone
the
third
wants
the
theory
of
comets
in
autumn
last
i
spent
two
months
in
calculation
to
no
purpose
for
want
of
a
good
method
which
made
me
afterward
return
to
the
first
book
and
enlarge
it
with
diverse
propositions
some
relating
to
comets
others
to
other
things
found
out
last
winter
the
third
i
now
design
to
suppress
philosophy
is
such
an
impertinently
litigious
lady
that
a
man
had
as
good
be
engaged
in
lawsuits
as
have
to
do
with
her
i
found
it
so
formerly
and
now
i
can
no
sooner
come
near
her
again
but
she
gives
me
warning
the
first
two
books
without
the
third
will
not
so
well
bear
the
title
of
naturalis
principia
and
therefore
i
had
altered
it
to
this
moti
corporum
libri
but
after
second
thoughts
i
retain
the
former
title
help
the
sale
of
the
book
which
i
ought
not
to
diminish
now
is
yours
in
replying
to
this
letter
on
june
halley
regrets
that
our
author
tranquillity
should
have
been
thus
disturbed
by
envious
rivals
and
implores
him
in
the
name
of
the
society
not
to
suppress
the
third
book
i
must
again
beg
you
says
he
not
to
let
your
resentments
run
so
high
as
to
deprive
us
of
your
third
book
wherein
your
applications
of
your
mathematical
doctrine
to
the
theory
of
comets
and
several
curious
experiments
which
as
i
guess
by
what
you
write
ought
to
compose
it
will
undoubtedly
render
it
acceptable
to
those
who
will
call
themselves
philosophers
without
mathematics
which
are
much
the
greater
number
to
these
solicitations
newton
seems
to
have
readily
yielded
his
second
book
was
sent
to
the
society
and
presented
on
march
the
third
book
was
also
transmitted
and
presented
on
april
and
the
whole
work
was
completed
and
published
in
the
month
of
may
such
is
the
brief
account
of
the
publication
of
a
work
which
is
memorable
not
only
in
the
annals
of
one
science
or
of
one
country
but
which
will
form
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
will
ever
be
regarded
as
the
brightest
page
in
the
records
of
human
reason
we
shall
endeavor
to
convey
to
the
reader
some
idea
of
its
contents
and
of
the
brilliant
discoveries
which
it
disseminated
over
europe
the
consists
of
three
books
the
first
and
second
which
occupy
of
the
work
are
entitled
the
motion
of
and
the
third
bears
the
title
the
system
of
the
the
two
first
books
contain
the
mathematical
principles
of
philosophy
namely
the
laws
and
conditions
of
motions
and
forces
and
they
are
illustrated
with
several
philosophical
which
treat
of
some
of
the
most
general
and
points
in
philosophy
such
as
the
density
and
resistance
of
bodies
spaces
void
of
matter
and
the
motion
of
sound
and
light
the
object
of
the
third
book
is
to
deduce
from
these
principles
the
constitution
of
the
system
of
the
world
and
this
book
has
been
drawn
up
in
as
popular
a
style
as
possible
in
order
that
it
may
be
generally
read
the
great
discovery
which
characterizes
the
is
that
of
the
principle
of
universal
gravitation
as
deduced
from
the
motion
of
the
moon
and
from
the
three
great
facts
or
laws
discovered
by
kepler
this
principle
is
every
particle
of
matter
is
attracted
by
or
gravitates
to
every
other
particle
of
matter
with
a
force
inversely
proportional
to
the
squares
of
their
from
the
first
law
of
kepler
namely
the
proportionality
of
the
areas
to
the
times
of
their
revolution
newton
inferred
that
the
force
which
kept
the
planet
in
its
orbit
was
always
directed
to
the
sun
and
from
the
second
law
of
kepler
that
every
planet
moves
in
an
ellipse
with
the
sun
in
one
of
its
foci
he
drew
the
still
more
general
inference
that
the
force
by
which
the
planet
moves
round
that
focus
varies
inversely
as
the
square
of
its
distance
from
the
focus
as
this
law
was
true
in
the
motion
of
satellites
round
their
primary
planets
newton
deduced
the
equality
of
gravity
in
all
the
heavenly
bodies
toward
the
sun
upon
the
supposition
that
they
are
equally
distant
from
its
centre
and
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
bodies
he
succeeded
in
verifying
this
truth
by
numerous
and
accurate
experiments
by
taking
a
more
general
view
of
the
subject
newton
demonstrated
that
a
conic
section
was
the
only
curve
in
which
a
body
could
move
when
acted
upon
by
a
force
varying
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
and
he
established
the
conditions
depending
on
the
velocity
and
the
primitive
position
of
the
body
which
were
requisite
to
make
it
describe
a
circular
an
elliptical
a
parabolic
or
a
hyberbolic
orbit
notwithstanding
the
generality
and
importance
of
these
results
it
still
remained
to
be
determined
whether
the
forces
resided
in
the
centres
of
the
planets
or
belonged
to
each
individual
particle
of
which
they
were
composed
newton
removed
this
uncertainty
by
demonstrating
that
if
a
spherical
body
acts
upon
a
distant
body
with
a
force
varying
as
the
distance
of
this
body
from
the
centre
of
the
sphere
the
same
effect
will
be
produced
as
if
each
of
its
particles
acted
upon
the
distant
body
according
to
the
same
law
and
hence
it
follows
that
the
spheres
whether
they
are
of
uniform
density
or
consist
of
concentric
layers
with
densities
varying
according
to
any
law
whatever
will
act
upon
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
if
their
force
resided
in
their
centres
alone
but
as
the
bodies
of
the
solar
system
are
very
nearly
spherical
they
will
all
act
upon
one
another
and
upon
bodies
placed
on
their
surfaces
as
if
they
were
so
many
centres
of
attraction
and
therefore
we
obtain
the
law
of
gravity
which
subsists
between
spherical
bodies
namely
that
one
sphere
will
act
upon
another
with
a
force
directly
proportional
to
the
quantity
of
matter
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
between
the
centres
of
the
spheres
from
the
equality
of
action
and
reaction
to
which
no
exception
can
be
found
newton
concluded
that
the
sun
gravitated
to
the
planets
and
the
planets
to
their
satellites
and
the
earth
itself
to
the
stone
which
falls
upon
its
surface
and
consequently
that
the
two
mutually
gravitating
bodies
approached
to
one
another
with
velocities
inversely
proportional
to
their
quantities
of
matter
having
established
this
universal
law
newton
was
enabled
not
only
to
determine
the
weight
which
the
same
body
would
have
at
the
surface
of
the
sun
and
the
planets
but
even
to
calculate
the
quantity
of
matter
in
the
sun
and
in
all
the
planets
that
had
satellites
and
even
to
determine
the
density
or
specific
gravity
of
the
matter
of
which
they
were
composed
in
this
way
he
found
that
the
weight
of
the
same
body
would
be
times
greater
at
the
surface
of
the
sun
than
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
that
the
density
of
the
earth
was
four
times
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
the
planets
increasing
in
density
as
they
receded
from
the
centre
of
the
system
if
the
peculiar
genius
of
newton
has
been
displayed
in
his
investigation
of
the
law
of
universal
gravitation
it
shines
with
no
less
lustre
in
the
patience
and
sagacity
with
which
he
traced
the
consequences
of
this
fertile
principle
the
discovery
of
the
spheroidal
form
of
jupiter
by
cassini
had
probably
directed
the
attention
of
newton
to
the
determination
of
its
cause
and
consequently
to
the
investigation
of
the
true
figure
of
the
earth
the
next
subject
to
which
newton
applied
the
principle
of
gravity
was
the
tides
of
the
ocean
the
philosophers
of
all
ages
had
recognized
the
connection
between
the
phenomena
of
the
tides
and
the
position
of
the
moon
the
college
of
jesuits
at
coimbra
and
subsequently
antonio
de
dominis
and
kepler
distinctly
referred
the
tides
to
the
attraction
of
the
waters
of
the
earth
by
the
moon
but
so
imperfect
was
the
explanation
which
was
thus
given
of
the
phenomena
that
galileo
ridiculed
the
idea
of
lunar
attraction
and
substituted
for
it
a
fallacious
explanation
of
his
own
that
the
moon
is
the
principal
cause
of
the
tides
is
obvious
from
the
fact
that
it
is
high
water
at
any
given
place
about
the
time
when
she
is
in
the
meridian
of
that
place
and
that
the
sun
performs
a
secondary
part
in
their
production
may
be
proved
from
the
circumstance
that
the
highest
tides
take
place
when
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
earth
are
in
the
same
straight
line
that
is
when
the
force
of
the
sun
conspires
with
that
of
the
moon
and
that
the
lowest
tides
take
place
when
the
lines
drawn
from
the
sun
and
moon
to
the
earth
are
at
right
angles
to
each
other
that
is
when
the
force
of
the
sun
acts
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
moon
by
comparing
the
spring
and
neap
tides
newton
found
that
the
force
with
which
the
moon
acted
upon
the
waters
of
the
earth
was
to
that
with
which
the
sun
acted
upon
them
as
to
that
the
force
of
the
moon
produced
a
tide
of
feet
that
of
the
sun
one
of
feet
and
both
of
them
combined
one
of
french
feet
a
result
which
in
the
open
sea
does
not
deviate
much
from
observation
having
thus
ascertained
the
force
of
the
moon
on
the
waters
of
our
globe
he
found
that
the
quantity
of
matter
in
the
moon
was
to
that
in
the
earth
as
to
and
the
density
of
the
moon
to
that
of
the
earth
as
to
the
motions
of
the
moon
so
much
within
the
reach
of
our
own
observation
presented
a
fine
field
for
the
application
of
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
the
irregularities
exhibited
in
the
lunar
motions
had
been
known
in
the
time
of
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
tycho
had
discovered
the
great
inequality
called
the
variation
amounting
to
and
depending
on
the
alternate
acceleration
and
retardation
of
the
moon
in
every
quarter
of
a
revolution
and
he
had
also
ascertained
the
existence
of
the
annual
equation
of
these
two
inequalities
newton
gave
a
most
satisfactory
explanation
although
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
comets
were
retained
in
their
orbits
by
the
same
laws
which
regulated
the
motions
of
the
planets
yet
it
was
difficult
to
put
this
opinion
to
the
test
of
observation
the
visibility
of
comets
only
in
a
small
part
of
their
orbits
rendered
it
difficult
to
ascertain
their
distance
and
periodic
times
and
as
their
periods
were
probably
of
great
length
it
was
impossible
to
correct
approximate
results
by
repeated
observations
newton
however
removed
this
difficulty
by
showing
how
to
determine
the
orbit
of
a
comet
namely
the
form
and
position
of
the
orbit
and
the
periodic
time
by
three
observations
by
applying
this
method
to
the
comet
of
he
calculated
the
elements
of
its
orbit
and
from
the
agreement
of
the
computed
places
with
those
which
were
observed
he
justly
inferred
that
the
motions
of
comets
were
regulated
by
the
same
laws
as
those
of
the
planetary
bodies
this
result
was
one
of
great
importance
for
as
the
comets
enter
our
system
in
every
possible
direction
and
at
all
angles
with
the
ecliptic
and
as
a
great
part
of
their
orbits
extends
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
solar
system
it
demonstrated
the
existence
of
gravity
in
spaces
far
removed
beyond
the
planet
and
proved
that
the
law
of
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
squares
of
the
distance
was
true
in
every
possible
direction
and
at
very
remote
distances
from
the
centre
of
our
system
such
is
a
brief
view
of
the
leading
discoveries
which
the
first
announced
to
the
world
the
grandeur
of
the
subjects
of
which
it
treats
the
beautiful
simplicity
of
the
system
which
it
unfolds
the
clear
and
concise
reasoning
by
which
that
system
is
explained
and
the
irresistible
evidence
by
which
it
is
supported
might
have
insured
it
the
warmest
admiration
of
contemporary
mathematicians
and
the
most
welcome
reception
in
all
the
schools
of
philosophy
throughout
europe
this
however
is
not
the
way
in
which
great
truths
are
generally
received
though
the
astronomical
discoveries
of
newton
were
not
assailed
by
the
class
of
ignorant
pretenders
who
attacked
his
optical
writings
yet
they
were
everywhere
resisted
by
the
errors
and
prejudices
which
had
taken
a
deep
hold
even
of
the
strongest
minds
the
philosophy
of
descartes
was
predominant
throughout
europe
appealing
to
the
imagination
and
not
to
the
reason
of
mankind
it
was
quickly
received
into
popular
favor
and
the
same
causes
which
facilitated
its
introduction
extended
its
influence
and
completed
its
dominion
over
the
human
mind
in
explaining
all
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
by
a
system
of
vortices
in
a
fluid
medium
diffused
through
the
universe
descartes
had
seized
upon
an
analogy
of
the
most
alluring
and
deceitful
kind
those
who
had
seen
heavy
bodies
revolving
in
the
eddies
of
a
whirlpool
or
in
the
gyrations
of

circular
motion

no
difficulty
in
conceiving
how
the
planets
might
revolve
round
the
sun
by
an
analogous
movement
the
mind
instantly
grasped
at
an
explanation
of
so
palpable
a
character
and
which
required
for
its
development
neither
the
exercise
of
patient
thought
nor
the
aid
of
mathematical
skill
the
talent
and
perspicuity
with
which
the
cartesian
system
was
expounded
and
the
show
by
which
it
was
sustained
contributed
powerfully
to
its
adoption
while
it
derived
a
still
higher
sanction
from
the
excellent
character
and
the
unaffected
piety
of
its
author
thus
intrenched
as
the
cartesian
system
was
in
the
strongholds
of
the
human
mind
and
fortified
by
its
most
obstinate
prejudices
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
pure
and
sublime
doctrines
of
the
were
distrustfully
received
and
perseveringly
resisted
the
uninstructed
mind
could
not
readily
admit
the
idea
that
the
great
masses
of
the
planets
were
suspended
in
empty
space
and
retained
in
their
orbits
by
an
invisible
influence
residing
in
the
sun
and
even
those
philosophers
who
had
been
accustomed
to
the
rigor
of
true
scientific
research
and
who
possessed
sufficient
mathematical
skill
for
the
examination
of
the
newtonian
doctrines
viewed
them
at
first
as
reviving
the
occult
qualities
of
the
ancient
physics
and
resisted
their
introduction
with
a
pertinacity
which
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
prejudiced
no
doubt
in
favor
of
his
own
metaphysical
views
leibnitz
himself
misapprehended
the
principles
of
the
newtonian
philosophy
and
endeavored
to
demonstrate
the
truths
in
the
by
the
application
of
different
principles
huygens
who
above
all
other
men
was
qualified
to
appreciate
the
new
philosophy
rejected
the
doctrine
of
gravitation
as
existing
between
the
individual
particles
of
matter
and
received
it
only
as
an
attribute
of
the
planetary
masses
john
bernouilli
one
of
the
first
mathematicians
of
his
age
opposed
the
philosophy
of
newton
mairan
in
the
early
part
of
his
life
was
a
strenuous
defender
of
the
system
of
vortices
cassini
and
maraldi
were
quite
ignorant
of
the
and
occupied
themselves
with
the
most
absurd
methods
of
calculating
the
orbits
of
comets
long
after
the
newtonian
method
had
been
established
on
the
most
impregnable
foundation
and
even
fontenelle
a
man
of
liberal
views
and
extensive
information
continued
throughout
the
whole
of
his
life
to
maintain
the
doctrines
of
descartes
the
chevalier
louville
of
paris
had
adopted
the
newtonian
philosophy
before
gravesande
had
introduced
it
into
the
dutch
universities
at
a
somewhat
earlier
period
and
maupertuis
in
consequence
of
a
visit
which
he
paid
to
england
in
became
a
zealous
defender
of
it
but
notwithstanding
these
and
some
other
examples
that
might
be
quoted
we
must
admit
the
truth
of
the
remark
of
voltaire
that
though
newton
survived
the
publication
of
the
more
than
forty
years
yet
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
had
not
above
twenty
followers

of
england

johann
von
archenholz
in
the
seventeenth
century
appeared
a
class
of
rovers
wholly
distinct
from
any
of
their
predecessors
in
the
annals
of
the
world
differing
as
widely
in
their
plans
organizations
and
exploits
as
in
the
principles
that
governed
their
actions
these
adventurers
were
a
piratical
gang
called
buccaneers
or
sometimes
as
in
the
following
narrative
freebooters
who
became
noted
for
their
exploits
in
the
west
indies
and
on
south
american
coasts
the
nucleus
of
this
association
of
pirates
is
traced
to
bands
of
smugglers
english
french
and
dutch
who
carried
on
a
secret
trade
with
the
island
of
santo
domingo
later
they
settled
there
and
on
other
islands
and
after
a
while
began
to
prey
upon
spanish
commerce
in
they
made
their
chief
on
the
island
of
tortuga
in
they
aided
in
the
english
conquest
of
jamaica
and
ten
years
later
settled
the
bahamas
all
these
islands
became
centres
of
their
activities
most
renowned
among
the
leaders
of
the
buccaneers
was
sir
henry
morgan
a
welshman
who
died
in
jamaica
in
for
years
he
carried
stolen
riches
to
england
and
charles
ii
rewarded
him
with
knighthood
having
pillaged
parts
of
cuba
he
took
and
ransomed
puerto
bello
in
colombia
and
maracaibo
in
venezuela
in
morgan
gathered
a
fleet
of
nearly
forty
vessels
and
a
force
of
over
two
thousand
men
for
the
greatest
of
the
exploits
of
the
buccaneers
the
capture
and
plunder
of
the
wealthy
city
of
panama
by
the
end
of
the
century
the
buccaneers
had
become
dispersed
among
contending
european
armies
and
little
more
was
heard
of
them
morgan
plan
of
capturing
panama
was
apparently
attended
with
innumerable
difficulties
the
chief
obstacle
was
the
position
of
that
city
on
the
pacific
coast
at
such
a
great
distance
from
the
caribbean
sea
and
not
an
individual
on
board
the
fleet
was
acquainted
with
the
road
that
led
to
the
goal
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
morgan
determined
in
the
first
instance
to
go
to
the
island
of
catharine
where
the
spaniards
confined
their
criminals
and
thence
to
supply
himself
with
guides
the
passage
was
rapid
morgan
landed
in
that
island
one
thousand
men
who
by
threatening
to
put
to
death
everyone
that
hesitated
for
a
moment
to
surrender
so
terrified
the
spaniards
that
they
speedily
capitulated
it
was
stipulated
that
to
save
at
least
the
honor
of
the
garrison
there
should
be
a
sham
fight
in
consequence
of
this
a
very
sharp
fire
ensued
from
the
forts
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
from
the
ships
but
on
both
sides
the
cannons
discharged
only
powder
further
to
give
a
serious
appearance
to
this
military
comedy
the
governor
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
while
attempting
to
pass
from
fort
jerome
to
another
fort
at
the
beginning
the
crafty
morgan
did
not
rely
too
implicitly
on
this
feint
and
to
provide
for
every
event
he
secretly
ordered
his
soldiers
to
load
their
fusees
with
bullets
but
to
discharge
them
in
the
air
unless
they
perceived
some
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
spaniards
but
his
enemies
adhered
most
faithfully
to
their
capitulation
and
this
mock
engagement
in
which
neither
party
was
sparing
of
powder
was
followed
for
some
time
with
all
the
circumstances
which
could
give
it
the
semblance
of
reality
ten
forts
surrendered
one
after
another
after
sustaining
a
kind
of
siege
or
assault
and
this
series
of
successes
did
not
cost
the
life
of
a
single
man
nor
even
a
scratch
on
the
part
either
of
the
victors
or
of
the
conquered
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
were
shut
up
in
the
great
fort
of
santa
teresa
which
was
built
on
a
steep
rock
and
the
conquerors
who
had
not
taken
any
sustenance
for
hours
declared
a
most
serious
war
against
the
horned
cattle
and
game
of
the
district
in
the
isle
of
constantine
morgan
found
four
hundred
persons
of
both
sexes
one
hundred
ninety
of
whom
were
soldiers
criminals
children
and
negroes
there
were
ten
forts
containing
cannons
which
were
so
defended
in
other
respects
by
nature
that
very
small
garrisons
were
deemed
amply
sufficient
to
protect
them
besides
an
immense
quantity
of
fusees
and
grenades
which
were
at
that
time
much
used
upward
of
three
hundred
quintals
of
gunpowder
were
found
in
the
arsenal
the
whole
of
this
ammunition
was
carried
on
board
the
pirate
ships
the
cannon
which
could
be
of
no
service
to
them
were
spiked
their
carriages
were
burned
and
all
the
forts
demolished
excepting
one
which
the
freebooters
themselves
garrisoned
morgan
selected
three
of
the
criminals
to
serve
him
as
guides
to
panama
these
he
afterward
on
his
return
to
jamaica
set
at
liberty
even
giving
them
a
share
in
the
booty
the
plan
conceived
by
this
intrepid
chieftain
inspired
all
his
companions
in
arms
with
genuine
enthusiasm
it
had
a
character
of
grandeur
and
audacity
that
inflamed
their
courage
how
capable
they
were
of
executing
it
the
subsequent
pages
will
demonstrate
panama
which
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
pacific
ocean
in
the
ninth
degree
of
northern
latitude
was
at
that
time
one
of
the
greatest
as
well
as
most
opulent
cities
in
america
it
contained
two
thousand
large
houses
the
greater
number
of
which
were
very
fine
piles
of
building
and
five
thousand
smaller
dwellings
each
mostly
three
stories
in
height
of
these
a
pretty
considerable
number
were
erected
of
stone
all
the
rest
of
very
elegantly
constructed
and
magnificently
furnished
that
city
was
defended
by
a
rampart
and
was
surrounded
with
walls
it
was
the
emporium
for
the
silver
of
mexico
and
the
gold
of
peru
whence
those
valuable
metals
were
brought
on
the
backs
of
mules
two
thousand
of
which
animals
were
kept
for
this
purpose
only
across
the
isthmus
toward
the
northern
coast
of
the
pacific
a
great
commerce
was
also
carried
on
at
panama
in
negroes
which
trade
was
at
that
time
almost
exclusively
confined
to
the
english
dutch
french
and
danes
with
this
branch
of
commerce
the
italians
were
intimately
acquainted
they
gave
lessons
in
it
to
all
the
rest
of
europe
and
as
two
things
were
necessary
in
which
the
genoese
were
by
no
means
deficient
money
and
address
they
were
chiefly
occupied
in
the
slave
trade
and
supplied
the
provinces
of
peru
and
chile
with
negroes
at
the
period
now
referred
to
the
president
of
panama
was
the
principal
intendant
or
overseer
of
the
civil
department
and
of
all
the
troops
in
the
viceroyalty
of
peru
he
had
in
his
dependency
puerto
bello
and
nata
two
cities
inhabited
by
the
spaniards
together
with
the
towns
of
cruces
panama
capira
and
veragua
the
city
of
panama
had
also
a
bishop
who
was
a
suffragan
of
the
archbishop
of
lima
the
merchants
lived
in
great
opulence
and
their
churches
were
decorated
with
uncommon
magnificence
the
cathedral
was
erected
in
the
italian
style
surmounted
with
a
large
cupola
and
enriched
with
gold
and
silver
ornaments
as
also
were
the
eight
convents
which
this
city
comprised
at
a
small
distance
from
its
walls
there
were
some
small
islands
alike
embellished
by
art
and
by
nature
where
the
richest
inhabitants
had
their
country
houses
from
which
circumstance
they
were
called
the
gardens
of
panama
in
short
everything
concurred
to
render
this
place
important
and
agreeable
here
several
of
the
european
nations
had
palaces
for
carrying
on
their
commerce
and
among
these
were
the
genoese
who
were
held
in
great
credit
and
who
had
vast
warehouses
for
receiving
the
articles
of
their
immense
trade
as
also
a
most
magnificent
edifice
the
principal
houses
were
filled
with
beautiful
paintings
and
the
masterpieces
of
the
arts
which
had
here
been
accumulated
more
from
an
intense
desire
of
being
surrounded
with
all
the
splendor
of
luxury
since
they
possessed
the
means
of
procuring
it
than
from
a
refined
taste
their
superabundance
of
gold
and
silver
had
been
employed
in
obtaining
these
splendid
superfluities
which
were
of
no
value
but
to
gratify
the
vanity
of
their
possessors
such
was
panama
in
when
the
freebooters
selected
it
as
the
object
of
their
bold
attempt
and
as
the
victim
of
their
extravagancies
and
immortalized
their
name
by
reducing
it
to
a
heap
of
ruins
in
the
execution
of
this
design
which
stupefied
the
new
world
they
displayed
equal
prudence
and
cruelty
previous
to
the
adoption
of
any
other
measure
it
was
necessary
that
the
pirates
should
get
possession
of
fort
laurent
which
was
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
river
chagres
with
this
view
morgan
detached
four
ships
with
four
hundred
men
under
the
command
of
the
intrepid
brodely
who
had
happily
succeeded
in
victualling
the
fleet
and
who
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
country
morgan
continued
at
the
island
of
catharine
with
the
rest
of
his
forces
his
plan
was
to
dissemble
his
vast
projects
against
panama
as
long
as
it
was
possible
and
to
cause
the
pillage
of
fort
laurent
to
be
regarded
as
a
common
expedition
to
which
he
would
confine
himself
brodely
discharged
his
commission
with
equal
courage
and
success
that
castle
was
situated
on
a
lofty
mountain
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
was
inaccessible
on
almost
every
side
the
first
attempts
were
fruitless
and
the
freebooters
who
advanced
openly
without
any
other
arms
than
their
fusees
and
sabres
at
first
lost
many
of
their
comrades
for
the
spaniards
not
only
made
use
of
all
their
artillery
and
musketry
against
them
but
were
also
seconded
by
the
indians
that
were
with
them
in
the
fort
and
whose
arrows
were
far
more
fatal
than
the
bullets
the
assailants
saw
their
fall
by
their
side
without
being
able
to
avenge
them
the
danger
of
their
present
situation
and
the
nature
of
their
arms
seemed
to
render
the
enterprise
altogether
impracticable
their
courage
began
to
waver
their
ranks
were
thrown
into
disorder
and
they
already
thought
of
retiring
when
the
provocations
of
the
spaniards
inspired
them
with
new
vigor
you
heretic
dogs
cried
they
in
a
triumphant
tone
you
cursed
english
possessed
by
the
devil
ah
you
will
go
to
panama
will
you
no
no
that
you
shall
not
you
shall
all
bite
the
dust
here
and
all
your
comrades
shall
share
the
same
fate
from
these
insulting
speeches
the
pirates
learned
that
the
design
of
their
expedition
was
discovered
and
from
that
moment
they
determined
to
carry
the
fort
or
die
to
a
man
upon
the
spot
they
immediately
commenced
the
assault
in
defiance
of
the
shower
of
arrows
that
were
discharged
against
them
and
undismayed
by
the
loss
of
their
commander
both
of
whose
legs
had
been
carried
away
by
a
one
of
the
pirates
in
whose
shoulder
an
arrow
was
deeply
fixed
tore
it
out
himself
exclaiming
patience
comrades
an
idea
strikes
me
all
the
spaniards
are
lost
he
tore
some
cotton
out
of
his
pocket
with
which
he
covered
his
ramrod
set
the
cotton
on
fire
and
shot
this
burning
material
in
lieu
of
bullets
at
the
houses
of
the
fort
which
were
covered
with
light
wood
and
the
leaves
of
palm
trees
his
companions
collected
together
the
arrows
which
were
strewed
around
them
upon
the
ground
and
employed
them
in
a
similar
manner
the
effect
of
this
novel
mode
of
attack
was
most
rapid
many
of
the
houses
caught
fire
a
blew
up
the
besieged
being
thus
diverted
from
their
means
of
defence
thought
only
of
stopping
the
progress
of
the
fire
night
came
on
under
cover
of
the
darkness
the
freebooters
attempted
also
to
set
on
fire
the
palisades
which
were
made
of
a
kind
of
wood
that
was
easily
kindled
in
this
attempt
likewise
they
were
crowned
with
success
the
soil
which
the
palisades
supported
fell
down
for
want
of
support
and
filled
up
the
ditch
the
spaniards
nevertheless
continued
to
defend
themselves
with
much
courage
being
animated
by
the
example
of
their
commander
who
fought
till
the
very
moment
he
received
a
mortal
blow
the
garrison
had
throughout
the
use
of
their
cannon
which
kept
up
a
most
violent
fire
but
the
enemy
had
already
made
too
much
progress
to
be
disconcerted
with
it
they
persevered
in
their
attack
until
they
at
length
became
masters
of
the
fort
a
great
number
of
spaniards
finding
themselves
deprived
of
all
resource
precipitated
themselves
from
the
top
of
the
walls
into
the
river
that
they
might
not
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
freebooters
who
made
only
prisoners
and
ten
of
these
were
wounded
men
who
had
concealed
themselves
among
the
dead
in
the
hope
of
escaping
their
ferocious
conquerors
these
men
were
all
that
remained
of
three
hundred
forty
who
had
composed
the
garrison
which
had
shortly
before
been
reënforced
for
the
president
of
panama
having
been
apprised
from
carthagena
of
the
real
object
of
the
pirates
expedition
came
to
encamp
with
hundred
men
in
the
vicinity
of
the
threatened
city
this
information
was
confirmed
to
the
freebooters
after
the
capture
of
the
fort
at
the
same
time
they
learned
that
among
this
body
of
troops
there
were
four
hundred
horsemen
six
hundred
indians
and
two
hundred
the
last
of
whom
being
very
expert
in
hunting
bulls
were
intended
in
case
of
necessity
to
send
two
thousand
of
those
animals
among
the
freebooters
it
is
scarcely
credible
that
brodely
continued
to
command
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
his
wounds
but
he
would
not
by
retiring
compromise
the
advantages
which
he
had
so
dearly
purchased
for
out
of
four
hundred
men
who
had
composed
his
little
army
one
hundred
sixty
had
been
killed
eighty
wounded
and
of
these
eighty
sixty
were
altogether
out
of
the
battle
the
bodies
of
the
french
and
english
were
interred
but
those
of
the
spaniards
were
thrown
down
from
the
top
of
the
fort
and
remained
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
its
walls
brodely
found
much
ammunition
and
abundance
of
provisions
with
which
he
was
the
more
satisfied
as
he
knew
that
the
grand
fleet
was
greatly
in
want
of
both
those
articles
he
caused
the
fort
to
be
rebuilt
as
far
as
was
practicable
in
order
that
he
might
defend
himself
there
in
case
the
spaniards
should
make
a
speedy
attempt
to
retake
it
in
this
situation
he
waited
for
morgan
who
in
a
short
time
appeared
with
his
fleet
as
the
pirates
approached
they
beheld
the
english
flag
flying
on
the
fort
and
abandoned
themselves
to
the
most
tumultuous
joy
and
excessive
drinking
without
dreaming
of
the
dangers
occurring
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
chagres
beneath
whose
waters
there
was
a
sunken
rock
the
coasting
pilots
of
those
latitudes
came
to
their
assistance
but
their
intoxication
and
their
impatience
would
not
permit
them
to
attend
to
the
latter
this
negligence
was
attended
with
most
fatal
consequences
and
cost
them
four
ships
one
of
which
was
the
admiral
vessel
the
crews
however
together
with
their
ladings
were
saved
this
loss
greatly
affected
morgan
who
was
wholly
intent
upon
his
vast
designs
but
who
nevertheless
made
his
entrance
into
laurent
where
he
left
a
garrison
of
five
hundred
men
he
also
detached
from
his
body
of
troops
one
hundred
fifty
men
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
several
spanish
vessels
that
were
in
the
river
the
remainder
of
his
forces
morgan
directed
to
follow
himself
they
carried
but
a
small
supply
of
provisions
not
only
that
his
march
might
not
be
impeded
but
also
because
the
means
of
conveyance
were
very
limited
besides
he
was
apprehensive
lest
he
should
expose
to
famine
the
garrison
he
had
left
in
the
fort
which
did
not
abound
with
provisions
and
was
cut
off
on
every
side
from
receiving
supplies
and
it
was
likewise
necessary
that
he
should
leave
sufficient
for
the
support
of
all
the
prisoners
and
slaves
whose
number
amounted
very
nearly
to
one
thousand
after
all
these
steps
had
been
taken
morgan
briefly
addressed
his
comrades
whom
he
exhorted
to
arm
themselves
with
courage
calculated
to
subdue
every
obstacle
that
they
might
return
to
jamaica
with
an
increase
of
glory
and
riches
sufficient
to
supply
all
their
wants
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
at
length
on
january
he
commenced
his
march
toward
panama
with
a
chosen
body
of
freebooters
who
were
thirteen
hundred
strong
the
greatest
part
of
their
journey
was
performed
by
water
following
the
course
of
the
river
five
vessels
were
laden
with
the
artillery
and
the
troops
were
placed
in
a
very
narrow
compass
on
board
boats
one
reason
why
they
had
brought
only
a
small
quantity
of
provisions
was
because
they
hoped
to
meet
with
a
supply
on
their
route
but
on
the
very
day
of
their
arrival
at
rio
de
los
bravos
the
expectations
of
the
pirates
were
frustrated
at
the
place
where
they
landed
they
literally
found
nothing
the
terror
which
they
everywhere
inspired
had
preceded
them
the
spaniards
had
betaken
themselves
to
flight
and
had
carried
with
them
all
their
cattle
and
even
the
very
last
article
of
their
movables
they
had
cut
the
grain
and
pulse
without
waiting
for
their
maturity
the
roots
of
which
were
even
torn
out
of
the
ground
the
houses
and
stables
were
empty
the
first
day
of
their
voyage
was
spent
in
abstinence
tobacco
affording
them
the
only
gratification
that
was
not
refused
them
the
second
day
was
not
more
prosperous
in
addition
to
the
various
impediments
by
which
their
passage
was
obstructed
want
of
rain
had
rendered
the
waters
of
the
river
very
shallow
and
a
great
number
of
trees
had
fallen
into
it
presenting
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
on
their
arrival
at
the
cruz
de
juan
gallego
they
had
no
other
alternative
left
but
to
abandon
their
boats
and
pursue
their
route
by
land
otherwise
they
must
have
resigned
themselves
to
the
confusion
necessarily
consequent
on
retracing
their
steps
animated
however
by
their
chieftains
they
determined
to
try
the
adventure
on
the
third
day
their
way
led
them
to
a
forest
where
there
was
no
beaten
path
and
the
soil
of
which
was
marshy
but
it
was
indispensably
necessary
that
they
should
leave
this
wretched
passage
in
order
that
they
might
reach
with
incredible
difficulties
indeed
the
town
of
cedro
bueno
for
all
these
excessive
fatigues
they
found
no
indemnification
whatever
there
were
no
provisions
not
even
a
single
head
of
game
these
luckless
adventurers
at
length
saw
themselves
surrounded
by
all
the
horrors
of
famine
many
of
them
were
reduced
to
devour
the
leaves
of
trees
the
majority
were
altogether
destitute
of
sustenance
in
this
state
of
severe
privations
and
with
very
light
clothing
they
passed
the
nights
lying
on
the
shore
benumbed
with
cold
incapable
of
enjoying
even
in
the
smallest
degree
the
solace
of
sleep
and
expecting
with
anxiety
the
return
of
day
their
courage
was
supported
only
with
the
hope
of
meeting
some
bodies
of
spaniards
or
some
groups
of
fugitive
inhabitants
and
consequently
of
finding
provisions
with
an
abundance
of
which
the
latter
never
failed
to
supply
themselves
when
they
abandoned
their
dwellings
further
the
pirates
were
obliged
to
continue
their
route
at
a
small
distance
only
from
the
river
as
they
had
contrived
to
drag
their
canoes
along
with
them
and
whenever
the
water
was
of
sufficient
depth
part
of
the
men
embarked
on
board
them
while
the
remainder
prosecuted
their
journey
by
land
they
were
preceded
a
few
hundred
paces
by
an
advanced
guard
of
thirty
men
under
the
direction
of
a
guide
who
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
country
and
the
strictest
silence
was
observed
in
order
that
they
might
discover
the
ambuscades
of
the
spaniards
and
if
it
were
possible
make
some
of
them
prisoners
on
the
fourth
day
the
freebooters
reached
torna
cavellos
a
kind
of
fortified
place
which
also
had
been
evacuated
the
spaniards
having
carried
away
with
them
everything
that
was
portable
and
consumed
the
rest
by
fire
their
design
was
to
leave
the
pirates
neither
movables
nor
utensils
in
fact
this
was
the
only
resource
left
them
by
which
they
could
reduce
those
formidable
guests
to
such
a
state
of
privation
as
to
compel
them
to
retire
the
only
things
which
had
not
been
burned
or
carried
off
were
some
large
sacks
of
hides
which
were
to
these
freebooters
objects
of
avidity
and
which
had
almost
occasioned
a
bloody
dispute
previously
to
devouring
them
it
was
necessary
to
cut
them
into
pieces
with
all
possible
equity
thus
divided
the
leather
was
cut
into
small
bits
these
were
scraped
and
violently
beaten
between
two
stones
it
was
then
soaked
in
water
in
order
to
become
soft
after
which
it
was
roasted
nor
thus
prepared
could
it
have
been
swallowed
if
they
had
not
taken
most
copious
draughts
of
water
after
this
repast
the
freebooters
resumed
their
route
and
arrived
at
where
also
they
found
an
abandoned
fortress
on
the
fifth
day
they
reached
barbacoas
but
still
no
place
presented
to
their
view
either
man
animal
or
any
kind
of
provisions
whatever
here
likewise
the
spaniards
had
taken
the
precaution
of
carrying
away
or
destroying
everything
that
could
serve
for
food
fortunately
however
they
discovered
in
the
hollow
of
a
rock
two
sacks
of
flour
some
fruit
and
two
large
vessels
filled
with
wine
this
discovery
would
have
transported
with
joy
a
less
numerous
troop
but
to
so
many
famished
men
it
presented
only
very
feeble
resource
morgan
who
did
not
suffer
less
from
hunger
than
the
rest
generously
appropriated
none
of
it
to
his
own
use
but
caused
this
scanty
supply
to
be
distributed
among
those
who
were
just
ready
to
faint
many
indeed
were
almost
dying
these
were
conveyed
on
board
the
boats
the
charge
of
which
was
committed
to
them
while
those
who
had
hitherto
had
the
care
of
the
vessels
were
reunited
to
the
body
that
was
travelling
by
land
their
march
was
very
slow
both
on
account
of
the
extreme
weakness
of
these
men
even
after
the
very
moderate
refreshment
they
had
just
taken
as
well
as
from
the
roughness
and
difficulties
of
the
way
and
during
the
fifth
day
the
pirates
had
no
other
sustenance
but
the
leaves
of
trees
and
the
grass
of
the
meadows
on
the
following
day
the
freebooters
made
still
less
progress
want
of
food
had
totally
exhausted
them
and
they
were
frequently
obliged
to
rest
at
length
they
reached
a
plantation
where
they
found
a
vast
quantity
of
maize
in
a
granary
that
had
just
been
abandoned
what
a
discovery
was
this
to
men
whose
appetites
were
sharpened
by
such
long
protractions
a
great
many
of
them
devoured
the
grains
in
a
raw
state
the
rest
covered
their
shares
with
the
leaves
of
the
and
thus
cooked
or
roasted
the
maize
reinvigorated
by
this
food
they
pursued
their
route
and
on
the
same
day
they
discovered
a
troop
of
indians
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
but
those
savages
betook
themselves
to
flight
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
them
the
cruel
freebooters
fired
on
them
and
killed
some
of
them
the
rest
escaped
exclaiming
come
you
english
dogs
come
into
the
meadow
we
will
there
wait
for
you
to
this
challenge
the
pirates
were
little
tempted
to
answer
their
supply
of
maize
was
exhausted
and
they
were
further
obliged
to
lie
down
in
the
open
air
without
eating
anything
hitherto
in
the
midst
of
privations
the
most
severely
painful
as
well
as
of
the
most
difficult
labors
they
had
evinced
an
inexhaustible
patience
but
at
length
violent
murmurs
arose
morgan
and
his
rash
enterprise
became
the
object
of
their
execrations
a
great
number
of
the
freebooters
were
desirous
of
returning
but
the
rest
although
discontented
declared
that
they
would
rather
perish
than
not
terminate
an
expedition
so
far
advanced
and
which
had
cost
them
so
much
trouble
on
the
following
day
they
crossed
the
river
and
directed
their
march
toward
a
place
which
they
took
for
a
town
or
at
all
events
for
a
village
where
to
their
great
satisfaction
they
thought
they
perceived
at
a
distance
the
smoke
issuing
from
several
chimneys
there
at
last
said
they
we
shall
surely
find
both
men
and
provisions
their
expectations
were
completely
frustrated
not
a
single
individual
appeared
throughout
the
place
they
found
no
other
articles
of
sustenance
but
a
leather
sack
full
of
bread
together
with
a
few
cats
and
dogs
which
were
instantly
killed
and
devoured
the
place
where
they
had
now
arrived
was
the
town
of
cruces
at
which
were
usually
landed
those
commodities
which
were
conveyed
up
the
river
chagres
in
order
to
be
carried
by
land
to
panama
which
was
eight
french
leagues
distant
here
were
some
fine
warehouses
built
of
stone
and
likewise
some
stables
belonging
to
the
king
of
spain
which
at
the
moment
of
the
pirates
arrival
were
the
only
buildings
that
remained
untouched
all
the
inhabitants
having
betaken
themselves
to
flight
after
they
had
set
their
houses
on
fire
every
corner
of
these
royal
buildings
was
ransacked
by
the
freebooters
who
at
length
discovered
seventeen
large
vessels
full
of
peruvian
wine
which
were
immediately
emptied
scarcely
however
had
they
drunk
this
liquor
which
was
to
recruit
their
exhausted
strength
than
they
all
fell
at
first
they
thought
the
wine
was
poisoned
they
were
overwhelmed
with
consternation
and
were
fully
persuaded
that
their
last
hour
was
come
their
terrors
were
unfounded
as
their
sudden
indisposition
was
easily
accounted
for
by
the
nature
of
the
unwholesome
food
they
had
so
recently
taken
by
the
extreme
diminution
of
their
strength
and
the
avidity
with
which
they
had
swallowed
the
wine
in
fact
they
found
themselves
much
better
on
the
following
day
as
morgan
had
been
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
removing
at
this
place
to
a
distance
from
all
his
ships
he
was
obliged
to
land
all
his
men
not
even
excepting
those
who
were
most
exhausted
by
weakness
the
shallops
alone
with
sixty
men
were
sent
to
the
spot
where
his
vessels
and
largest
ships
had
been
left
a
single
shallop
only
was
reserved
to
carry
news
if
occasion
offered
to
the
flotilla
morgan
prohibited
every
man
from
going
alone
to
any
distance
and
even
required
that
they
should
not
make
excursions
in
troops
amounting
to
less
than
a
hundred
men
famine
however
compelled
the
freebooters
to
infringe
this
prohibition
six
of
them
went
out
to
some
distance
in
quest
of
food
the
event
justified
the
foresight
of
their
chieftain
they
were
attacked
by
a
large
body
of
spaniards
and
could
not
without
very
great
difficulty
regain
the
village
they
had
also
the
mortification
to
see
one
of
their
comrades
taken
prisoner
morgan
now
determined
to
prosecute
his
march
after
reviewing
his
he
found
that
they
amounted
to
eleven
hundred
men
as
he
foresaw
that
they
were
apprehensive
lest
their
lost
comrade
should
betray
the
secret
of
their
enterprise
and
the
state
of
their
forces
morgan
made
them
believe
that
he
had
not
been
taken
that
he
had
only
lost
his
way
in
the
woods
but
had
now
returned
to
the
main
body
the
freebooters
were
on
the
eighth
day
of
their
painful
journey
and
nothing
but
the
hope
of
speedily
terminating
their
labors
could
support
them
much
longer
for
they
had
now
ascertained
that
they
were
on
the
way
to
panama
an
advanced
guard
of
two
hundred
men
was
therefore
formed
which
was
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
enemy
they
marched
onward
for
a
whole
day
without
perceiving
any
living
object
whatever
when
suddenly
a
shower
of
three
or
four
thousand
arrows
was
discharged
upon
them
from
the
top
of
a
rock
for
some
minutes
they
were
struck
with
astonishment
no
enemy
presented
himself
to
their
view
they
beheld
around
them
at
their
feet
above
their
heads
nothing
but
steep
rocks
trees
and
abysses
and
without
striking
a
single
blow
they
reckoned
twenty
of
their
comrades
killed
or
wounded
this
unexpected
attack
not
being
continued
they
pursued
their
march
across
a
forest
where
in
a
hollow
way
they
fell
upon
a
large
body
of
indians
who
opposed
their
progress
with
much
valor
in
this
engagement
the
freebooters
were
victorious
though
they
lost
eight
killed
and
ten
wounded
they
made
every
possible
effort
to
catch
some
of
the
fugitives
but
these
fled
away
with
the
velocity
of
stags
across
the
rocks
with
all
the
turnings
and
windings
of
which
they
were
intimately
acquainted
not
a
single
man
fell
into
their
hands
the
indian
chieftain
was
wounded
and
notwithstanding
he
lay
on
the
ground
he
continued
to
fight
most
obstinately
until
he
received
a
mortal
blow
he
wore
a
crown
of
feathers
his
death
made
a
great
impression
on
the
indians
and
was
the
principal
cause
of
their
defeat
the
ground
on
which
they
had
attacked
the
pirates
was
so
favorable
that
one
hundred
men
would
have
been
fully
sufficient
to
have
destroyed
the
whole
troop
of
freebooters
the
latter
availed
themselves
of
the
inconceivable
negligence
of
the
spaniards
in
not
taking
more
effectual
measures
for
the
defence
of
such
an
important
pass
they
exerted
all
possible
diligence
to
make
their
way
out
of
this
labyrinth
of
rocks
where
a
second
attack
of
a
similar
kind
would
have
been
attended
with
consequences
of
the
most
fatal
tendency
to
them
and
to
get
into
an
open
and
level
country
on
the
ninth
day
they
found
themselves
in
a
plain
or
spacious
meadow
entirely
divested
of
trees
so
that
nothing
could
shelter
them
against
the
ardor
of
the
solar
rays
it
rained
however
most
copiously
at
the
moment
of
their
arrival
and
this
circumstance
added
yet
more
to
their
difficulties
in
a
short
time
they
were
wetted
to
their
skins
in
case
of
a
sudden
attack
their
arms
and
ammunition
would
have
afforded
them
but
little
assistance
while
the
spaniards
would
be
able
most
effectively
to
use
their
spears
which
could
not
be
damaged
by
the
rain
no
human
means
could
remedy
this
inconvenience
the
pirates
had
only
to
abandon
themselves
to
their
fate
morgan
most
ardently
desired
that
some
prisoner
might
fall
into
his
hands
from
whose
confessions
either
voluntary
or
involuntary
he
might
obtain
some
information
by
which
to
direct
his
march
with
this
intention
fifty
men
were
detached
in
different
directions
with
a
promised
reward
of
three
hundred
piasters
out
of
the
society
stock
to
the
man
who
should
bring
in
either
a
spaniard
or
an
indian
exclusive
of
the
share
of
booty
to
which
he
should
be
entitled
about
noon
they
ascended
a
steep
hill
from
whose
summit
they
began
to
discover
the
pacific
at
this
sight
which
announced
the
speedy
termination
of
their
miseries
they
were
transported
with
joy
from
the
top
of
this
eminence
they
also
perceived
six
ships
departing
from
panama
and
sailing
toward
the
islands
of
taroga
and
tarogiela
which
were
situated
in
the
vicinity
of
that
city
panama
itself
for
the
present
escaped
their
observation
but
how
was
their
satisfaction
increased
on
beholding
in
a
valley
a
vast
number
of
bulls
cows
horses
and
particularly
of
asses
which
were
under
the
care
of
some
spaniards
who
betook
themselves
to
flight
the
moment
they
saw
the
formidable
pirates
approaching
to
the
latter
no
could
be
more
desirable
they
were
ready
to
faint
with
famine
and
fatigue
the
sustenance
which
they
immediately
devoured
would
contribute
to
give
them
that
strength
which
every
moment
would
become
so
necessary
to
them
and
it
is
altogether
inconceivable
how
the
spaniards
could
abandon
such
a
prey
to
their
famished
enemies
this
want
of
foresight
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
panic
with
which
the
spaniards
were
seized
the
spot
which
had
just
been
deserted
was
occupied
for
some
hours
by
the
freebooters
they
stood
in
great
need
of
rest
and
were
in
much
greater
want
of
provisions
they
rushed
therefore
on
the
animals
that
had
been
left
behind
of
which
they
killed
a
great
number
and
devoured
their
flesh
with
such
avidity
that
the
blood
streamed
in
torrents
from
their
lips
over
the
whole
of
their
bodies
what
could
not
be
consumed
on
the
spot
they
carried
away
with
them
for
morgan
apprehensive
of
an
attack
by
the
flower
of
the
spaniards
troops
allowed
them
only
a
small
space
of
time
for
repose
they
resumed
their
march
but
the
uncertainty
in
which
they
had
so
long
been
involved
was
not
yet
at
an
end
notwithstanding
all
that
chieftain
experience
his
spies
could
not
succeed
in
taking
a
single
prisoner
a
circumstance
which
seems
almost
incredible
in
a
populous
country
and
after
nine
days
march
morgan
was
deprived
of
every
hint
that
was
so
essentially
necessary
to
him
further
the
freebooters
were
utterly
ignorant
how
near
they
were
to
panama
when
from
the
summit
of
a
hill
they
discovered
the
towers
of
that
city
they
could
not
refrain
from
shouting
for
joy
the
air
reëchoed
with
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
they
threw
up
their
caps
in
the
air
vociferating
victory
victory
in
this
place
they
halted
and
pitched
their
camp
with
the
firm
determination
of
attacking
panama
on
the
following
day
at
this
time
the
spaniards
were
in
the
utmost
confusion
the
first
defensive
step
which
they
deemed
it
advisable
to
take
was
to
despatch
fifty
horsemen
for
the
purpose
of
reconnoitring
the
enemy
the
detachment
approached
the
camp
within
and
offered
some
insults
to
the
freebooters
but
speedily
returned
toward
the
city
exclaiming
nos
veromos
you
dogs
we
will
see
you
again
shortly
after
a
second
detachment
of
two
hundred
men
appeared
who
occupied
every
pass
in
order
that
after
the
victory
which
they
considered
as
infallible
not
one
single
pirate
might
escape
the
freebooters
however
beheld
with
the
utmost
concern
the
measures
which
were
adopted
in
order
to
block
them
up
and
previously
to
every
other
consideration
turned
their
attention
toward
their
abundant
supply
of
provision
as
they
were
prohibited
from
kindling
any
fire
they
devoured
the
meat
they
had
brought
with
them
in
a
raw
they
could
not
conceive
how
the
spaniards
could
carry
their
neglect
or
their
fancied
security
to
such
a
length
as
not
to
disturb
that
repose
of
which
they
stood
so
greatly
in
need
nor
how
they
could
allow
them
the
necessary
leisure
for
recruiting
their
exhausted
strength
and
thus
become
the
more
fit
for
battle
they
availed
themselves
of
this
oversight
and
were
perfectly
at
ease
after
they
had
glutted
themselves
with
animal
food
they
lay
down
upon
the
grass
and
slept
quietly
throughout
the
night
the
spaniards
made
their
artillery
roar
without
intermission
in
order
to
display
their
vigilance
on
the
ensuing
day
which
was
the
tenth
of
their
march
january
the
pirates
advanced
at
a
very
early
hour
with
their
military
music
and
took
the
road
leading
to
panama
by
the
advice
however
of
one
of
their
guides
they
quitted
the
main
road
and
went
out
of
the
way
across
a
thick
wood
through
which
there
was
no
footpath
for
this
the
spaniards
were
unprepared
having
confined
themselves
to
the
erection
of
batteries
and
construction
of
redoubts
on
the
highway
they
soon
perceived
the
inutility
of
this
measure
and
were
obliged
to
relinquish
their
guns
in
order
to
oppose
their
enemies
on
the
contrary
side
but
not
being
able
to
take
their
cannons
away
from
their
batteries
they
were
consequently
incapacitated
from
making
use
of
one
part
of
their
defensive
means
after
two
hours
march
the
freebooters
discovered
the
hostile
army
which
was
a
very
fine
one
well
equipped
and
was
advancing
in
battle
array
the
soldiers
were
clad
in
silk
stuffs
and
the
horsemen
were
seated
upon
their
mettlesome
steeds
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
the
president
in
person
took
the
command
of
this
body
of
troops
which
was
of
considerable
importance
both
for
the
country
and
likewise
for
the
forces
supported
there
by
spain
he
marched
against
the
pirates
with
four
regiments
of
the
line
consisting
of
infantry
besides
hundred
of
another
description
four
hundred
horsemen
and
hundred
wild
bulls
under
the
conduct
of
several
hundred
indians
and
negroes
this
army
which
extended
over
the
whole
plain
was
discovered
by
the
pirates
from
the
summit
of
a
small
eminence
and
presented
to
them
a
most
imposing
appearance
insomuch
that
they
were
struck
with
a
kind
of
terror
they
now
began
to
feel
some
anxiety
as
to
the
event
of
an
engagement
with
forces
so
greatly
superior
to
them
in
point
of
numbers
but
they
were
soon
convinced
that
they
must
actually
conquer
or
die
and
encouraged
each
other
to
fight
till
the
very
last
drop
of
their
blood
was
shed
a
determination
this
which
on
the
part
of
these
intrepid
men
was
by
no
means
a
vain
resolution
they
divided
themselves
into
three
bodies
placed
two
hundred
of
their
best
marksmen
in
the
front
and
marched
boldly
against
the
spaniards
who
were
drawn
up
in
order
of
battle
on
a
very
spacious
plain
the
governor
immediately
ordered
the
cavalry
to
charge
the
enemy
and
the
wild
bulls
to
be
at
the
same
time
let
loose
upon
them
but
the
ground
was
unfavorable
for
this
purpose
the
horsemen
encountered
nothing
but
marshes
behind
which
were
posted
the
two
hundred
marksmen
who
kept
up
such
a
continual
and
fire
that
horses
and
men
fell
in
heaps
beneath
their
shots
before
it
was
possible
to
effect
a
retreat
fifty
horsemen
only
escaped
this
formidable
discharge
of
musketry
the
bulls
on
whose
services
they
had
calculated
so
highly
it
became
impracticable
to
drive
among
the
pirates
hence
such
a
confusion
arose
as
to
completely
reverse
the
whole
plan
of
the
battle
the
freebooters
in
consequence
attacked
the
spanish
infantry
with
so
much
the
greater
vigor
they
successively
knelt
on
the
ground
fired
and
rose
up
again
while
those
who
were
on
one
knee
directed
their
fire
against
the
hostile
army
which
began
to
waver
the
pirates
who
continued
standing
rapidly
charged
their
every
man
on
this
occasion
evinced
a
dexterity
and
presence
of
mind
which
decided
the
fate
of
the
battle
almost
every
shot
was
fatal
the
spaniards
nevertheless
continued
to
defend
themselves
with
much
valor
which
proved
of
little
service
against
an
exasperated
enemy
whose
courage
inflamed
by
despair
derived
additional
strength
from
their
successes
at
length
the
spaniards
had
recourse
to
their
last
expedient
the
wild
cattle
were
let
loose
upon
the
rear
of
the
freebooters
the
buccaneers
were
in
their
element
by
their
shouts
they
intimidated
the
bulls
at
the
same
time
waving
flags
before
them
fired
on
the
animals
and
laid
them
all
upon
the
ground
without
exception
the
engagement
lasted
two
hours
and
notwithstanding
the
spaniards
were
so
greatly
superior
both
in
numbers
and
in
arms
it
terminated
entirely
in
favor
of
the
freebooters
the
spaniards
lost
the
chief
part
of
their
cavalry
on
which
they
had
built
their
expectations
of
victory
the
remainder
returned
to
the
charge
repeatedly
but
their
efforts
only
tended
to
render
their
defeat
the
more
complete
a
very
few
horsemen
only
escaped
together
with
some
few
of
the
infantry
who
threw
down
their
arms
to
facilitate
the
rapidity
of
their
flight
six
hundred
spaniards
lay
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
besides
these
they
sustained
a
very
considerable
loss
in
such
as
were
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
among
the
latter
were
some
franciscans
who
had
exposed
themselves
to
the
greatest
dangers
in
order
that
they
might
animate
the
combatants
and
afford
the
last
consolations
of
religion
to
the
dying
they
were
conducted
into
morgan
presence
who
instantly
pronounced
sentence
of
death
upon
them
in
vain
did
these
hapless
priests
implore
that
pity
which
they
might
have
expected
from
a
less
ferocious
enemy
they
were
all
killed
by
many
spaniards
who
were
apprehensive
lest
they
should
be
overtaken
in
their
flight
had
concealed
themselves
in
the
flags
and
rushes
along
the
banks
of
the
river
they
were
mostly
discovered
and
hacked
to
pieces
by
the
merciless
pirates
the
freebooters
task
however
was
by
no
means
completed
they
had
yet
to
take
panama
a
large
and
populous
city
which
was
defended
by
forts
and
batteries
and
into
which
the
governor
had
retired
together
with
the
fugitives
the
conquest
of
this
place
was
the
more
difficult
as
the
pirates
had
dearly
purchased
their
victory
and
their
remaining
forces
were
in
no
respect
adequate
to
encounter
the
difficulties
attending
such
an
enterprise
it
was
however
determined
to
make
an
attempt
morgan
had
just
procured
from
a
wounded
captive
spanish
officer
the
necessary
information
but
he
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
it
would
not
do
to
allow
the
spaniards
time
to
adopt
new
measures
of
defence
the
city
was
therefore
assaulted
on
the
same
day
in
defiance
of
a
formidable
artillery
which
wrought
great
havoc
among
the
freebooters
and
at
the
end
of
three
hours
they
were
in
possession
of
panama
the
capture
of
that
city
was
followed
by
a
general
pillage
morgan
who
dreaded
the
consequence
of
excessive
intoxication
especially
after
his
men
had
suffered
such
a
long
abstinence
prohibited
them
from
drinking
any
wine
under
the
severest
penalties
he
foresaw
that
such
a
prohibition
would
infallibly
be
infringed
unless
it
were
sanctioned
by
an
argument
far
more
powerful
than
the
fear
of
punishment
he
therefore
caused
it
to
be
announced
that
he
had
received
information
that
the
spaniards
had
poisoned
all
their
wine
this
dexterous
falsehood
produced
the
desired
effect
and
for
the
first
time
the
freebooters
were
temperate
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
panama
had
betaken
themselves
to
flight
they
had
embarked
their
women
their
riches
all
their
movables
that
were
of
any
value
and
small
in
bulk
and
had
sent
this
valuable
cargo
to
the
island
of
taroga
the
men
were
dispersed
over
the
country
but
in
sufficiently
great
numbers
to
appear
formidable
to
the
pirates
whose
forces
were
much
diminished
and
who
could
not
expect
any
assistance
from
abroad
they
therefore
continued
constantly
together
and
for
their
greater
security
most
of
them
encamped
without
the
walls
we
have
now
reached
the
time
when
morgan
committed
a
barbarous
and
incomprehensible
action
concerning
which
his
comrades
some
of
whom
were
his
historians
have
given
only
a
very
ambiguous
explanation
notwithstanding
that
all
the
precious
articles
had
been
carried
away
from
panama
there
still
remained
as
in
every
great
european
trading
city
a
vast
number
of
shops
warehouses
and
magazines
filled
with
every
kind
of
merchandise
besides
a
very
great
quantity
of
wrought
and
manufactured
articles
the
productions
of
luxury
and
industry
that
city
contained
immense
stores
of
flour
wine
and
spices
vast
magazines
of
that
metal
which
is
justly
deemed
the
most
valuable
of
all
because
it
is
the
most
useful
extensive
buildings
in
which
were
accumulated
prodigious
stores
of
iron
tools
and
implements
anvils
and
ploughs
which
had
been
received
from
europe
and
were
destined
to
revive
the
spanish
colonies
some
judgment
may
be
formed
respecting
the
value
of
the
articles
only
when
it
is
considered
that
a
quintal
one
hundredweight
of
iron
was
sold
at
panama
for
piasters
about
dollars
all
these
multifarious
articles
so
essentially
necessary
for
furnishing
colonists
with
the
means
of
subsistence
were
it
should
seem
of
no
value
in
the
estimation
of
the
ferocious
morgan
because
he
could
not
carry
them
away
although
by
preserving
them
he
might
have
made
use
of
them
by
demanding
a
specific
ransom
for
them
circumstances
might
also
enable
him
to
derive
some
further
advantages
from
them
but
in
fact
whatever
was
distant
or
uncertain
presented
no
attraction
to
this
barbarian
who
was
eager
to
enjoy
but
more
ardent
to
destroy
he
was
struck
by
one
consideration
only
all
these
bulky
productions
of
art
and
industry
were
for
the
moment
of
no
use
to
the
freebooters
of
what
importance
to
him
was
the
ruin
of
many
thousand
innocent
families
he
consulted
only
the
ferocity
of
his
character
and
without
communicating
his
design
to
any
individual
he
secretly
caused
the
city
to
be
set
on
fire
in
several
places
in
a
few
hours
it
was
almost
entirely
consumed
the
spaniards
that
had
remained
in
panama
as
well
as
the
pirates
themselves
who
were
at
first
ignorant
whence
the
conflagration
proceeded
ran
together
and
united
their
efforts
in
order
to
extinguish
the
flames
they
brought
water
and
pulled
down
houses
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
further
progress
of
that
destructive
element
all
their
exertions
were
fruitless
a
violent
wind
was
blowing
and
in
addition
to
this
circumstance
the
principal
part
of
the
buildings
in
that
city
were
constructed
of
wood
its
finest
houses
together
with
their
valuable
furniture
among
which
was
the
magnificent
palace
belonging
to
the
genoese
the
churches
convents
courthouse
shops
hospitals
pious
foundations
warehouses
loaded
with
sacks
of
flour
nearly
two
hundred
other
warehouses
filled
with
merchandise
all
were
reduced
to
ashes
the
fire
also
consumed
a
great
number
of
animals
horses
mules
and
many
slaves
who
had
concealed
themselves
and
who
were
burned
alive
a
very
few
houses
only
escaped
the
fire
which
continued
burning
upward
of
four
weeks
amid
the
havoc
produced
in
every
quarter
by
the
conflagration
the
freebooters
did
not
neglect
to
pillage
as
much
as
they
possibly
could
by
which
means
they
collected
a
considerable
booty
morgan
seemed
ashamed
of
his
atrocious
act
he
carefully
concealed
that
he
had
ever
executed
it
and
gave
out
that
the
spaniards
themselves
had
set
their
city
on
fire
struggle
of
the
dutch
against

and
england
davies
seldom
has
any
people
held
out
so
heroically
against
overwhelming
numbers
as
did
the
dutch
in
of
the
various
wars
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
that
which
he
carried
on
against
holland
was
one
of
the
most
important
by
its
settlement
at
the
peace
of
nimwegen
the
long
hostilities
between
france
and
holland
and
their
allies
were
brought
to
a
close
and
holland
was
once
more
saved
from
threatened
destruction
louis
having
invaded
the
spanish
netherlands
had
reluctantly
consented
to
the
treaty
of
by
which
he
retained
a
small
part
of
the
low
countries
by
insisting
on
this
treaty
holland
gave
deep
offence
to
the
french
monarch
who
in
began
a
war
of
revenge
against
the
netherlands
where
his
schemes
of
large
acquisition
had
been
thwarted
his
first
attempt
was
to
isolate
holland
and
having
purchased
the
king
of
sweden
he
bribed
charles
ii
of
england
uncle
of
william
of
orange
to
enter
into
a
secret
treaty
against
the
netherlands
the
principal
events
of
the
war
are
narrated
by
davies
who
shows
how
the
old
spirit
of
the
dutch
returned
to
them
in
this
supreme
hour
of
new
peril
to
their
liberties
the
dutch
though
in
defence
of
their
religion
and
liberties
they
had
beaten
the
first
soldiers
in
the
world
were
never
essentially
a
military
nation
and
in
a
long
interval
of
peace
and
devotion
to
the
pursuits
of
commerce
had
rendered
them
quite
unfit
for
warlike
enterprises
the
army
was
entirely
disorganized
the
officers
appointed
by
the
magistrates
of
the
towns
on
the
score
of
relationship
or
party
adherence
without
the
slightest
regard
to
their
efficiency
were
suffered
without
fear
of
punishment
to
keep
the
numbers
of
their
regiments
incomplete
in
order
that
they
might
appropriate
the
pay
of
the
vacancies
while
the
men
independent
and
undisciplined
were
allowed
to
spend
their
time
in
the
pursuit
of
some
gainful
trade
or
peaceful
occupation
instead
of
practising
military
exercises
the
disputes
concerning
the
appointment
of
a
had
impeded
any
fresh
levies
the
recruits
refusing
to
take
the
oath
to
the
states
except
in
conjunction
with
the
prince
of
orange
and
had
induced
many
of
the
best
and
most
experienced
officers
to
take
service
in
the
french
army
the
fortifications
of
the
towns
were
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
no
measures
had
been
adopted
for
the
security
of
the
frontier
such
was
the
state
to
which
party
spirit
had
reduced
a
nation
filled
with
brave
intelligent
and
virtuous
inhabitants
and
governed
by
statesmen
as
able
and
wise
as
the
world
ever
saw
when
the
two
most
powerful
sovereigns
of
europe
declared
war
against
her
the
manifests
were
both
issued
on
the
same
day
that
of
the
king
of
england
is
strongly
marked
by
the
duplicity
which
was
the
distinguishing
characteristic
both
of
himself
and
of
his
court
as
then
constituted
from
the
style
of
the
document
one
might
be
led
to
suppose
that
he
was
forced
into
the
war
with
extreme
reluctance
and
regret
and
only
in
consequence
of
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
redress
by
any
other
means
for
the
deep
injuries
he
had
sustained
he
declared
that
so
far
back
as
the
year
his
parliament
had
complained
of
the
wrongs
and
oppressions
exercised
by
the
dutch
on
his
subjects
in
the
east
indies
and
for
which
they
had
refused
to
make
reparation
by
amicable
means
they
had
openly
refused
him
the
honor
of
the
flag
one
of
the
most
ancient
prerogatives
of
his
crown
had
sought
to
invite
the
king
of
france
to
hostilities
against
him
and
had
insulted
his
person
and
dignity
by
the
abusive
pictures
and
medals
exposed
in
all
their
towns
this
expression
was
understood
to
allude
to
a
medal
complained
of
three
years
before
and
to
a
portrait
of
cornelius
de
witt
in
the
perspective
of
which
was
a
representation
of
the
burning
of
chatham
cornelius
de
witt
being
an
of
dordrecht
the
council
of
that
town
had
with
a
natural
pride
caused
this
picture
to
be
painted
and
hung
up
in
the
the
extreme
sensitiveness
manifested
by
charles
on
this
point
appeared
to
the
states
rather
superfluous
in
a
monarch
whose
own
kingdom
teemed
with
the
most
offensive
truths
relative
to
himself
and
his
government
as
if
determined
that
the
mode
of
commencing
hostilities
should
be
as
lawless
and
unjust
as
the
war
itself
the
court
of
england
several
days
before
the
declaration
was
issued
had
commanded
sir
robert
holmes
to
attack
the
dutch
smyrna
fleet
on
its
return
while
cruising
near
the
isle
of
wight
holmes
met
the
admiral
sprague
by
whom
he
was
informed
of
the
near
approach
of
the
vessels
but
anxious
to
secure
to
himself
the
whole
of
the
booty
estimated
at
near
a
million
and
a
half
of
guilders
he
suffered
sprague
to
sail
away
in
ignorance
of
his
instructions
and
leaving
him
with
no
more
than
nine
frigates
and
three
yachts
his
covetousness
happily
proved
the
salvation
of
the
fleet
after
a
short
encounter
of
two
days
duration
holmes
was
forced
to
retire
having
captured
no
more
than
three
or
four
of
the
more
inconsiderable
ships
while
the
remainder
gained
their
harbors
in
safety
the
king
of
france
appeared
by
the
tenor
of
his
declaration
of
war
to
imagine
that
his
power
and
dignity
entitled
him
to
set
at
naught
alike
the
natural
rights
of
mankind
and
the
law
of
nations
it
resembled
indeed
rather
the
threat
of
a
predatory
incursion
on
the
part
of
a
barbarian
chief
than
the
justification
of
the
taking
up
of
arms
by
a
civilized
government
without
adducing
a
single
cause
of
complaint
he
satisfied
himself
with
declaring
that
the
conduct
of
the
states
had
been
such
as
it
was
not
consistent
with
his
glory
to
endure
any
longer
if
anything
indeed
could
justify
the
arrogant
tone
assumed
by
louis
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
would
have
done
so
an
army
of
one
hundred
twenty
thousand
able
and
troops
commanded
by
condé
and
turenne
and
numbering
in
its
ranks
volunteers
of
the
noblest
families
in
france
eager
to
distinguish
themselves
under
the
eye
of
their
sovereign
funds
lavishly
supplied
by
the
able
minister
of
finance
colbert
with
vast
magazines
of
ammunition
and
every
other
necessary
collected
and
winter
quarters
secured
in
the
neighboring
and
friendly
territories
of
cologne
and
muenster
seemed
means
almost
absurdly
disproportioned
in
magnitude
to
the
end
to
be
attained
at
the
same
time
he
was
but
too
well
informed
of
the
defenceless
condition
of
the
enemy
jan
de
witt
and
the
states
conceived
that
his
first
attempt
would
be
upon
maestricht
the
possession
of
which
he
was
known
to
have
long
coveted
and
that
the
difficulties
of
its
conquest
would
be
sufficient
to
deter
from
further
enterprise
a
monarch
of
whose
military
prowess
no
very
high
idea
was
entertained
and
who
was
supposed
to
be
far
more
enamoured
of
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
war
than
of
its
toils
and
dangers
they
accordingly
fortified
and
provided
maestricht
with
the
utmost
care
leaving
the
frontier
towns
on
the
rhine
in
an
utterly
inefficient
state
of
defence
aware
of
this
fact
louis
commenced
his
operations
on
the
side
of
cleves
and
separating
his
army
into
four
divisions
laid
siege
simultaneously
to
as
many
places
he
himself
summoned
the
town
of
rhynberg
the
duke
of
orleans
sat
down
before
orsay
condé
was
commanded
to
reduce
wesel
and
turenne
burick
all
surrendered
within
a
week
to
give
an
account
of
the
capture
of
the
towns
which
followed
would
be
but
to
heap
example
upon
example
of
cowardice
or
treachery
or
as
they
are
generally
found
together
both
nothing
less
than
entire
unanimity
and
the
most
undaunted
resolution
could
have
enabled
the
dutch
to
resist
the
overwhelming
force
employed
against
them
whereas
the
miserable
effect
of
the
internal
dissensions
of
the
republic
had
been
to
destroy
for
the
time
all
mutual
confidence
in
some
places
the
garrisons
despising
their
incapable
commanders
refused
to
act
or
the
governors
mistrustful
of
their
undisciplined
troops
lost
all
hope
of
prolonging
a
defence
in
others
the
detestation
entertained
by
the
magistrates
toward
the
orange
party
was
so
great
that
preferring
to
submit
to
france
rather
than
to
a
native
stadtholder
they
hastened
to
deliver
up
their
towns
to
the
invader
on
the
other
hand
the
friends
of
the
house
of
orange
looked
not
without
some
complacency
on
the
misfortunes
which
threatened
the
state
and
which
they
hoped
would
reduce
it
to
the
necessity
of
raising
the
prince
to
the
dignities
of
his
family
while
in
those
places
where
the
catholics
were
numerous
the
populace
under
the
guidance
of
the
priests
forced
both
garrisons
and
governments
to
open
their
gates
to
the
sovereign
whom
they
hailed
as
the
restorer
of
their
religion
with
scarcely
a
show
of
opposition
therefore
louis
advanced
to
the
rhine
the
drought
of
the
summer
was
so
excessive
that
this
river
had
become
fordable
in
three
places
which
being
pointed
out
to
the
french
by
some
peasants
of
guelderland
the
king
determined
on
attempting
the
passage
between
schenkenschans
and
arnhem
near
the
tollhuys
a
village
and
tower
about
two
miles
distant
from
the
separation
of
the
branch
of
the
river
called
the
wahal
the
prince
of
orange
who
was
stationed
with
about
thousand
men
at
arnhem
and
along
the
banks
of
the
yssel
instead
of
concentrating
his
forces
to
oppose
the
passage
of
the
enemy
contented
himself
with
detaching
de
montbas
to
guard
the
betuwe
and
to
throw
succors
if
requisite
into
nimwegen
but
this
general
deeming
the
troops
placed
under
his
command
insufficient
for
the
purpose
required
abandoned
his
post
he
was
arrested
and
sent
to
utrecht
but
afterward
allowed
to
escape
immediately
on
the
retreat
of
montbas
the
prince
despatched
general
wurtz
but
still
with
a
vastly
inadequate
force
to
occupy
the
post
at
the
tollhuys
the
french
cuirassiers
led
on
by
the
counts
de
guiche
and
revel
first
waded
into
the
ford
under
the
fire
of
the
artillery
from
the
tower
which
however
as
there
were
no
more
than
seventeen
men
stationed
in
it
was
not
very
formidable
they
were
followed
by
a
number
of
volunteers
and
in
a
short
time
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
passed
over
with
trifling
loss
the
dutch
troops
discouraged
as
well
by
the
unexpectedness
of
the
attempt
as
by
their
own
inferiority
in
number
were
driven
back
after
a
short
skirmish
a
bridge
was
then
thrown
across
the
river
for
the
infantry
and
thus
this
famous
passage
was
accomplished
with
comparative
ease
and
safety
as
the
position
of
the
prince
of
orange
on
the
yssel
which
in
consequence
of
the
drought
was
fordable
throughout
nearly
the
whole
of
its
course
was
now
no
longer
tenable
he
retired
to
utrecht
abandoning
arnhem
to
the
enemy
who
soon
after
received
the
submission
of
nimwegen
and
the
whole
of
guelderland
thiel
and
the
bommel
in
order
to
put
utrecht
into
a
state
of
defence
the
prince
considered
it
necessary
to
burn
down
all
the
suburbs
a
measure
which
when
he
proposed
to
the
states
of
the
province
he
found
them
reluctant
to
comply
with
he
therefore
immediately
quitted
that
city
and
with
the
whole
of
his
forces
made
a
further
retreat
into
holland
thus
left
wholly
unprotected
the
states
of
utrecht
conceived
that
the
only
resource
which
remained
to
them
was
to
mollify
the
conqueror
by
a
speedy
submission
and
accordingly
while
louis
was
yet
at
doesburg
they
sent
deputies
to
tender
to
him
the
keys
of
the
city
and
the
submission
of
the
whole
province
the
king
shortly
after
entered
utrecht
in
triumph
while
the
rather
than
the
arms
of
louis
subdued
guelderland
and
utrecht
his
allies
the
bishops
of
cologne
and
muenster
found
no
more
vigorous
resistance
in
overyssel
oldenzeel
entschede
and
other
small
towns
yielded
at
once
to
their
summons
deventer
though
well
garrisoned
and
amply
provided
was
surrendered
at
once
by
the
municipal
government
who
by
their
exhortations
and
example
induced
that
of
zwol
to
adopt
a
like
disgraceful
course
of
conduct
the
easily
acquired
spoil
was
divided
among
the
captors
the
king
of
france
who
had
furnished
a
subsidy
of
troops
placed
garrisons
in
campen
and
elburg
the
archbishop
of
cologne
retained
deventer
groll
and
breevoort
being
allotted
to
the
bishop
of
muenster
while
zwol
was
held
in
common
the
troops
of
these
warlike
prelates
exercised
everywhere
unbounded
license
and
cruelties
numbers
of
unhappy
families
were
driven
from
their
homes
and
taking
refuge
in
holland
added
to
the
consternation
which
prevailed
there
this
province
was
now
in
imminent
danger
no
barrier
remained
as
it
appeared
to
oppose
the
progress
of
the
enemy
the
army
of
the
prince
had
dwindled
to
about
thirteen
thousand
men
two
of
the
frontier
towns
woerden
and
oudewater
had
solicited
safeguards
from
the
invaders
and
naarden
was
surprised
by
the
count
of
rochefort
had
he
marched
on
at
once
to
muyden
he
might
have
occupied
that
town
also
a
post
of
immense
importance
from
its
situation
as
ships
going
to
amsterdam
must
come
within
reach
of
its
cannon
and
by
means
of
a
sluice
there
the
surrounding
country
may
at
any
time
be
inundated
it
had
been
left
destitute
of
a
garrison
but
the
french
commander
remaining
two
or
three
days
inactive
at
naarden
time
was
afforded
to
john
maurice
of
nassau
to
enter
muyden
with
a
strong
body
of
troops
and
the
chance
thus
lost
was
gone
forever
amazed
at
the
rapid
advances
of
the
invader
and
dispirited
by
the
symptoms
of
daily
increasing
aversion
which
the
great
body
of
the
people
manifested
to
his
government
the
courage
of
jan
de
witt
at
this
crisis
so
entirely
forsook
him
that
he
took
upon
himself
the
disgrace
of
being
the
first
to
propose
to
the
states
of
holland
that
they
should
implore
mercy
from
the
conqueror
the
resolution
was
immediately
adopted
and
by
them
proposed
to
the
where
it
was
passed
with
the
dissentient
voice
only
of
zealand
who
was
of
opinion
that
they
should
treat
simultaneously
with
england
from
whence
that
province
had
to
apprehend
the
principal
danger
a
deputation
was
accordingly
sent
to
louis
at
keppel
near
doesburg
headed
by
de
groot
and
commissioned
to
inquire
upon
what
terms
his
majesty
was
inclined
to
grant
peace
to
the
republic
they
were
answered
by
louvois
that
the
king
was
not
disposed
to
restore
any
of
the
conquests
he
had
made
or
to
enter
into
any
negotiation
unless
the
deputies
were
furnished
with
full
powers
and
instructions
as
to
what
the
states
intended
to
offer
returning
to
the
hague
de
groot
made
his
report
to
the
states
of
holland
and
representing
the
desperate
condition
of
their
affairs
recommended
that
louis
should
be
gratified
with
maestricht
and
all
the
other
towns
of
the
generality
and
that
a
sum
should
be
offered
him
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
war
provided
the
king
would
leave
them
in
possession
of
their
liberty
and
sovereignty
leyden
haarlem
and
most
of
the
other
towns
followed
the
example
of
the
nobles
in
receiving
these
pusillanimous
counsels
with
approbation
amsterdam
however
proved
that
the
spirit
of
the
gueux
was
not
yet
utterly
extinct
in
holland
prevailing
with
four
towns
of
north
holland
to
follow
their
example
the
council
of
amsterdam
refused
to
send
deputies
to
debate
upon
the
question
of
granting
full
powers
to
the
ambassadors
and
made
vigorous
preparations
for
the
defence
of
their
city
they
repaired
the
fortifications
and
strengthened
them
with
considerable
outworks
the
magistrates
themselves
being
the
first
to
sacrifice
their
magnificent
country
houses
in
the
suburbs
for
this
purpose
they
assigned
to
each
of
the
regiments
of
burgher
guards
who
were
ten
thousand
in
number
a
portion
of
the
city
to
watch
took
into
their
pay
as
soldiers
all
those
inhabitants
whom
the
cessation
of
trade
would
throw
out
of
employment
stationed
outlyers
in
the
y
amstel
zuyder
zee
and
pampus
and
cutting
the
dikes
laid
the
country
to
a
great
distance
round
under
water
they
likewise
passed
a
resolution
that
though
all
the
rest
of
holland
should
make
terms
with
the
conqueror
they
would
sustain
the
siege
till
some
friendly
power
should
afford
them
assistance
the
causes
which
combined
to
expose
the
united
provinces
to
these
terrible
disasters
by
land
had
happily
no
influence
on
their
affairs
by
sea
the
fleet
commanded
by
de
ruyter
an
officer
surpassed
by
none
of
any
age
or
nation
in
ability
and
courage
and
of
devoted
fidelity
to
the
present
government
had
been
increased
to
ships
and
frigates
of
war
and
yachts
that
of
the
allies
commanded
by
the
duke
of
york
comprised
after
the
junction
of
the
french
squadron
under
the
count
one
hundred
besides
the
smaller
vessels
sailing
in
quest
of
the
enemy
de
ruyter
discovered
them
lying
in
solebay
evidently
unprepared
for
his
approach
on
this
occasion
was
felt
the
disadvantage
of
intrusting
an
officer
with
the
chief
command
without
at
the
same
time
giving
him
sufficient
authority
to
insure
its
beneficial
exercise
in
consequence
of
the
presence
on
board
of
cornelius
de
witt
the
deputy
of
the
states
de
ruyter
instead
of
ordering
an
immediate
attack
was
obliged
to
call
a
council
of
war
and
thus
gave
the
english
time
to
arrange
themselves
in
order
of
battle
which
they
did
with
astonishing
celerity
the
dutch
advanced
in
three
squadrons
nearly
in
a
line
with
each
other
the
admiral
bankert
on
the
left
to
the
attack
of
the
french
van
gend
on
the
right
with
the
purpose
of
engaging
the
blue
squadron
commanded
by
montague
earl
of
sandwich
while
de
ruyter
in
the
middle
directed
his
course
toward
the
red
flag
of
the
english
and
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
duke
of
york
vessel
said
to
his
pilot
there
is
our
man
the
pilot
instantly
steered
the
ship
right
down
upon
that
of
the
duke
and
a
terrific
broadside
was
returned
with
equal
fury
after
two
hours
incessant
firing
the
english
admiral
retreated
his
ship
being
so
damaged
that
he
was
obliged
to
transfer
his
flag
on
board
the
london
at
the
same
time
braakel
a
captain
who
had
signalized
himself
in
the
burning
of
chatham
with
a
vessel
of
guns
attacked
the
royal
james
of
one
hundred
four
guns
the
ship
of
the
earl
of
sandwich
which
he
boarded
and
fired
montague
refusing
to
surrender
was
drowned
in
the
attempt
to
escape
in
a
boat
on
the
other
hand
van
gend
the
admiral
of
the
squadron
engaged
with
the
earl
was
killed
in
the
beginning
of
the
action
the
contest
was
maintained
with
the
daring
and
steady
valor
characteristic
of
both
nations
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
nightfall
the
french
had
received
instructions
to
keep
aloof
from
the
fight
and
allow
the
two
fleets
to
destroy
each
other
and
these
they
took
care
to
carry
out
to
the
full
thus
the
only
assistance
they
afforded
to
the
english
was
to
prevent
the
dutch
squadron
engaged
in
watching
their
movements
from
acting
an
advantage
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
discouragement
their
behavior
occasioned
among
their
allies
though
both
parties
claimed
the
victory
it
undoubtedly
inclined
in
favor
of
the
dutch
who
sustained
a
loss
somewhat
inferior
to
that
of
their
antagonists
and
had
the
satisfaction
moreover
of
preventing
a
descent
upon
zealand
by
the
combined
fleets
which
was
to
have
been
the
immediate
consequence
of
a
defeat
this
was
however
attempted
about
a
month
after
when
the
disasters
attending
the
arms
of
the
states
by
land
having
induced
them
to
diminish
the
number
of
their
ships
de
ruyter
received
commands
to
remain
in
the
ports
and
avoid
an
engagement
the
whole
of
the
english
fleet
appeared
in
the
texel
provided
with
small
craft
for
the
purpose
of
landing
but
by
a
singular
coincidence
it
happened
that
on
the
very
day
fixed
for
the
attempt
the
water
continued
from
some
unknown
cause
so
low
as
to
render
it
impossible
for
the
vessels
to
approach
the
shore
and
to
impress
the
people
with
the
idea
that
the
ebb
of
the
tide
lasted
for
the
space
of
twelve
hours
immediately
after
a
violent
storm
arose
which
drove
the
enemy
entirely
away
from
the
coasts
the
internal
condition
of
the
united
provinces
was
at
this
time
such
as
to
incite
the
combined
monarchs
no
less
than
their
own
successes
to
treat
them
with
insolence
and
oppression
they
beheld
the
inhabitants
instead
of
uniting
with
one
generous
sentiment
of
patriotism
in
a
firm
and
strenuous
defence
of
their
fatherland
torn
by
dissensions
and
turning
against
each
other
the
rage
which
should
have
been
directed
against
their
enemies
the
divisions
in
every
province
and
town
were
daily
becoming
wider
and
more
embittered
though
both
parties
had
merited
an
equal
share
of
blame
for
the
present
miscarriages
the
people
imputed
them
exclusively
to
the
government
of
jan
de
witt
and
his
adherents
who
they
said
had
betrayed
and
sold
the
country
to
france
and
this
accusation
to
which
their
late
pusillanimous
counsels
gave
but
too
strong
a
color
of
plausibility
the
heads
of
the
orange
party
though
well
aware
of
its
untruth
diligently
sustained
and
propagated
the
ministers
of
the
church
always
influential
and
always
on
the
alert
made
the
pulpits
resound
with
declamations
against
the
treachery
and
incapacity
of
the
present
government
as
the
cause
of
all
the
evils
under
which
they
groaned
and
emphatically
pointed
to
the
elevation
of
the
prince
of
orange
to
the
dignities
of
his
ancestors
as
the
sole
remedy
now
left
them
to
this
measure
de
witt
and
his
brother
were
now
regarded
as
the
only
obstacles
and
so
perverted
had
the
state
of
public
feeling
become
that
the
most
atrocious
crimes
began
to
be
looked
upon
as
meritorious
actions
provided
only
they
tended
to
the
desired
object
of
removing
these
obnoxious
ministers
on
one
occasion
jan
de
witt
having
been
employed
at
the
chamber
of
the
states
to
a
late
hour
of
the
night
was
returning
home
attended
by
a
single
servant
according
to
his
custom
when
he
was
attacked
by
four
assassins
he
defended
himself
for
a
considerable
time
till
having
received
some
severe
wounds
he
fell
and
his
assailants
decamped
leaving
him
for
dead
one
only
james
van
der
graaf
was
arrested
the
other
three
took
refuge
in
the
camp
where
though
the
states
of
holland
earnestly
enjoined
the
prince
of
orange
and
the
other
generals
to
use
diligent
means
for
their
discovery
they
remained
unmolested
till
the
danger
was
passed
van
der
graaf
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death
the
pensionary
was
strongly
solicited
by
his
friends
to
gratify
the
people
by
interceding
for
the
pardon
of
the
criminals
but
he
resolutely
refused
to
adopt
any
such
mode
of
gaining
popularity
impunity
he
said
would
but
increase
the
number
and
boldness
of
such
miscreants
nor
would
he
attempt
to
appease
the
causeless
hatred
of
the
people
against
him
by
an
act
which
he
considered
would
tend
to
endanger
the
life
of
every
member
of
the
government
the
determination
however
just
was
imprudent
the
criminal
an
account
of
whose
last
moments
was
published
by
the
minister
who
attended
him
was
regarded
by
the
populace
as
a
victim
to
the
vengeance
of
jan
de
witt
and
a
martyr
to
the
good
of
his
country
on
the
same
day
a
similar
attempt
was
made
on
the
life
of
his
brother
cornelius
de
witt
at
dordrecht
by
a
like
number
of
assassins
who
endeavored
to
force
their
way
into
his
house
but
were
prevented
by
the
interference
of
a
detachment
of
the
burgher
guard
cornelius
had
already
on
his
return
from
the
fleet
in
consequence
of
impaired
health
been
greeted
with
the
spectacle
of
his
picture
which
had
given
such
umbrage
to
the
king
of
england
cut
into
strips
and
stuck
about
the
town
with
the
head
hanging
upon
the
gallows
these
symptoms
of
tumult
rapidly
increased
in
violence
a
mob
assembling
with
loud
cries
of
boven
de
witten
long
live
the
prince
of
orange
down
with
the
de
witts
surrounded
the
houses
of
the
members
of
the
council
whom
they
forced
to
send
for
the
prince
and
to
pass
an
act
repealing
the
perpetual
edict
declaring
him
stadtholder
and
releasing
him
from
the
oath
he
had
taken
not
to
accept
that
office
while
he
was
having
been
signed
by
all
the
other
members
of
the
council
this
act
was
carried
to
the
house
of
cornelius
de
witt
who
was
confined
to
his
bed
by
sickness
the
populace
at
the
same
time
surrounding
the
house
and
threatening
him
with
death
in
case
of
refusal
he
long
resisted
observing
that
he
had
too
many
balls
falling
around
him
lately
to
fear
death
which
he
would
rather
suffer
than
sign
that
paper
but
the
prayers
and
tears
of
his
wife
and
her
threats
that
if
he
delayed
compliance
she
would
throw
herself
and
her
children
among
the
infuriated
populace
in
the
end
overcame
his
resolution
he
added
to
his
signature
the
letters
vi
but
the
people
informed
by
a
minister
of
their
purport
obliged
him
to
erase
them
similar
commotions
broke
out
at
rotterdam
haarlem
leyden
amsterdam
and
in
other
towns
both
of
holland
and
zealand
where
the
populace
constrained
the
magistrates
by
menace
and
violence
to
the
repeal
of
the
edict
reluctant
to
have
such
a
measure
forced
upon
them
by
tumult
and
sedition
the
states
of
holland
and
zealand
now
unanimously
passed
an
act
revoking
the
perpetual
edict
and
conferring
on
the
prince
of
orange
the
dignity
of
stadtholder
captain
and
of
these
provinces
soon
afterward
cornelius
de
witt
was
thrown
into
prison
and
put
to
the
torture
on
a
false
charge
of
planning
the
assassination
of
the
prince
of
orange
jan
de
witt
visited
his
brother
in
his
agony
and
a
mob
bursting
into
the
jail
seized
upon
both
brothers
as
traitors
and
murdered
them
with
horrid
brutality
from
this
time
the
authority
of
william
became
almost
uncontrolled
in
the
united
provinces
most
of
the
leaders
of
the
louvestein
party
either
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
his
elevation
to
power
in
the
present
emergency
or
unwilling
to
encounter
the
vexation
of
a
fruitless
opposition
acquiesced
in
the
present
state
of
things
many
were
afterward
employed
by
him
and
distinguished
themselves
by
fidelity
and
zeal
in
his
service
the
constant
coöperation
and
participation
in
his
views
also
of
the
pensionary
fagel
gave
him
an
advantage
which
none
of
his
predecessors
had
ever
enjoyed
the
influence
of
the
pensionaries
of
holland
having
hitherto
been
always
opposed
and
forming
a
counterpoise
to
that
of
the
stadtholder
unquestionably
the
dutch
while
thus
parting
with
their
liberties
reaped
in
some
degree
the
benefits
usually
attendant
on
such
a
sacrifice
in
the
increased
firmness
and
activity
of
a
government
conducted
by
a
sole
responsible
head
at
the
time
of
the
embassy
of
peter
de
groot
to
solicit
peace
from
the
king
of
france
the
prince
had
so
far
partaken
of
the
general
dejection
as
to
ask
permission
of
the
states
to
nominate
a
deputy
to
treat
of
his
particular
interests
but
no
sooner
was
he
created
stadtholder
than
he
began
to
adopt
bolder
and
more
spirited
resolutions
for
the
safety
of
a
country
to
which
he
felt
himself
attached
by
new
and
stronger
ties
being
invited
by
the
assembly
of
the
states
to
give
his
opinion
on
the
terms
offered
by
the
allied
monarchs
he
declared
that
their
acceptance
would
entail
upon
them
certain
ruin
and
that
the
very
listening
to
such
was
pernicious
in
the
highest
degree
to
affairs
as
tending
to
disunite
and
dispirit
the
people
he
encouraged
them
to
hope
for
speedy
assistance
from
his
allies
pointed
out
the
resources
which
yet
existed
for
the
support
of
the
war
and
persuaded
them
rather
to
resolve
if
they
were
driven
to
extremity
to
embark
on
board
their
vessels
and
found
a
new
nation
in
the
east
indies
than
accept
the
conditions
at
the
same
time
he
spurned
with
indignation
the
flattering
proposals
made
him
both
by
the
kings
of
france
and
england
for
so
singularly
are
men
appointed
to
work
out
their
own
destiny
these
monarchs
now
vied
with
each
other
and
were
in
fact
principally
instrumental
in
exalting
the
power
and
dignity
of
a
prince
who
ere
long
was
to
hurl
the
brother
of
the
one
from
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
and
prepare
for
the
other
an
old
age
of
vexation
and
disgrace
if
not
to
lay
the
first
foundation
of
the
ruin
of
his
kingdom
in
the
next
century
louis
upon
the
appointment
of
the
prince
to
the
office
of
stadtholder
was
liberal
in
offers
of
honor
and
advantages
to
his
person
and
family
and
among
the
rest
was
one
which
he
considered
could
scarcely
fail
of
its
effect
that
namely
of
making
him
sovereign
of
the
provinces
under
the
protection
of
france
and
england
william
however
was
found
wholly
immovable
on
this
point
declaring
that
he
would
rather
retire
to
his
lands
in
germany
and
spend
his
life
in
hunting
than
sell
his
country
and
liberty
to
france
nor
were
the
dispiriting
representations
made
by
the
english
ambassadors
that
holland
was
utterly
lost
unless
he
consented
to
the
terms
proposed
at
all
more
influential
i
have
thought
of
a
means
he
replied
to
avoid
beholding
the
ruin
of
my
country
to
die
in
the
last
ditch
neither
indeed
was
the
state
of
the
country
though
sufficiently
deplorable
such
as
to
leave
him
no
choice
but
to
become
the
vassal
of
her
haughty
enemies
the
progress
of
the
invader
in
holland
was
effectually
arrested
by
the
state
of
defence
into
which
that
province
had
been
put
imitating
the
noble
example
set
them
by
amsterdam
the
other

by

principal
posts

at
length
finding
his
army
increased
by
the
addition
of

to

men
william
determined
to
infuse
new
vigor
into
the
public
mind
by
the
commencement
of
offensive
hostilities
he
first
formed
the
design
of
surprising
naarden
and
woerden
both
of
which
attempts
however
proved
unsuccessful
he
then
marched
toward
maestricht
captured
and
demolished
the
fort
of
valckenburg
by
which
that
town
was
straitened
and
with
the
view
of
diverting
the
force
of
the
enemy
by
carrying
the
war
into
his
own
territory
advanced
to
the
siege
of
charleroi
but
the
middle
of
winter
having
already
arrived
before
he
commenced
the
enterprise
he
was
soon
after
compelled
by
the
severity
of
the
weather
to
abandon
it
and
retire
to
holland
which
during
his
absence
had
from
the
same
cause
been
exposed
to
imminent
danger
the
duke
of
luxemburg
who
had
been
left
in
command
of
the
forces
in
utrecht
on
the
departure
of
the
king
of
france
for
paris
finding
that
the
ice
with
which
the
was
covered
was
sufficiently
strong
to
bear
the
passage
of
cavalry
marched
with
a
strong
body
of
troops
to
zwammerdam
and
thence
to
bodergrave
both
of
which
were
abandoned
the
purpose
of
the
french
commander
was
to
advance
directly
upon
the
hague
and
to
force
the
states
to
acknowledge
the
sovereignty
of
the
king
of
france
a
measure
which
would
he
conceived
involve
the
immediate
submission
of
the
whole
of
the
provinces
but
happily
his
project
was
defeated
by
a
sudden
thaw
which
obliged
him
to
return
to
utrecht
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
fort
of
nieuwerburg
situated
on
the
dike
which
afforded
the
only
passage
thither
was
deserted
by
the
commander
his
retreat
must
have
been
cut
off
and
his
army
exposed
to
almost
certain
destruction
before
his
departure
luxemburg
revenged
himself
on
the
luckless
villages
he
had
captured
which
he
pillaged
and
burned

the
ground

afterward
tried
for
breach
of
duty
and
executed

the
invaders
on
this
expedition
are
strenuously
denied
by
the
writers
on
the
french
side
their
conduct
in
utrecht
however
which
we
shall
have
occasion
hereafter
to
notice
affords
but
too
ample
evidence
that
there
was
some
truth
in
the
accusations
on
the
other
hand
that
the
dutch
authors
are
guilty
of
exaggeration
may
be
easily
believed
since
one
of
them
gravely
puts
into
the
mouth
of
the
duke
of
luxemburg
the
following
address
to
his
soldiers
go
my
children
plunder
murder
destroy
and
if
it
be
possible
to
commit
yet
greater
cruelties
be
not
negligent
therein
that
i
may
see
i
am
not
deceived
in
my
choice
of
the
flower
of
the
king
troops
though
it
might
well
have
been
feared
that
the
failure
of
all
the
enterprises
of
the
prince
of
orange
would
have
renewed
the
discontents
lately
prevalent
in
the
united
provinces
such
an
effect
was
in
no
degree
produced
the
very
boldness
of
the
designs
it
seemed
had
been
the
cause
of
their
and
argued
a
zeal
and
activity
for
the
public
good
which
inspired
unbounded
confidence
in
his
future
measures
the
appearance
of
renovated
vigor
in
the
united
provinces
moreover
encouraged
surrounding
states
to
make
some
demonstrations
in
their
favor
they
had
wished
to
see
them
humbled
but
not
destroyed
the
emperor
and
princes
of
germany
in
especial
contemplated
with
dread
the
prospect
of
exchanging
the
neighborhood
of
the
inoffensive
and
industrious
people
who
rarely
appeared
to
them
in
any
other
light
than
as
the
dispensers
of
abundance
wealth
and
luxury
for
that
of
an
ambitious
and
unscrupulous
monarch
whose
glory
was
in
destruction
and
from
whose
encroachments
their
boundaries
would
be
for
not
one
moment
safe
though
deeply
imbued
with
these
sentiments
the
elector
of
brandenburg
had
hitherto
been
deterred
from
lending
them
any
assistance
lest
should
they
be
forced
to
make
a
peace
with
the
king
of
france
the
whole
power
and
vengeance
of
that
monarch
might
be
directed
against
himself
he
now
induced
the
emperor
leopold
to
enter
into
an
alliance
with
him
by
virtue
of
which
he
levied
a
force
of
thousand
men
to
be
joined
with
an
equal
number
furnished
by
himself
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
the
advances
of
louis
though
the
secret
treaty
which
the
emperor
had
made
with
france
binding
himself
not
to
afford
aid
to
any
member
of
the
triple
alliance
and
of
which
the
elector
was
in
ignorance
limited
the
employment
of
the
imperial
army
strictly
to
the
protection
of
the
empire
and
consequently
prevented
it
from
marching
at
once
to
the
support
of
the
provinces
its
movement
was
of
considerable
advantage
to
their
affairs
in
calling
off
turenne
from
to
which
he
had
laid
siege
to
the
defence
of
the
places
on
the
rhine
the
bishops
of
muenster
and
cologne
also
whom
the
brave
defence
of
the
garrison
of
groningen
had
forced
to
raise
the
siege
were
under
the
necessity
of
abandoning
both
that
province
and
guelderland
and
hastening
to
the
protection
of
their
own
territories
among
the
benefits
which
the
dutch
anticipated
with
the
utmost
confidence
as
the
consequence
of
the
elevation
of
the
prince
of
orange
to
his
paternal
dignities
was
the
appeasing
the
hostility
of
his
uncle
the
king
of
england
in
this
however
they
were
wholly
deceived
on
the
meeting
of
parliament
in
this
year
the
chancellor
shaftesbury
addressed
the
two
houses
in
a
strain
of
hostile
feeling
to
the
dutch
nation
more
bitter
than
the
court
as
yet
ventured
to
express
he
represented
that
besides
the
personal
indignities
in
the
way
of
pictures
medals
and
other
public
affronts
which
the
king
received
from
the
states
they
came
at
last
to
such
a
height
of
insolence
as
to
deny
him
the
honor
of
the
flag
though
an
undoubted
jewel
of
the
crown
and
disputed
the
king
title
to
it
in
all
the
courts
of
europe
making
great
offers
to
the
french
king
if
he
would
stand
by
them
in
this
particular
but
both
kings
knowing
their
own
interest
resolved
to
join
against
them
who
were
the
common
enemies
of
all
monarchies
but
especially
the
english
their
only
competitor
in
commerce
and
naval
power
and
the
chief
obstacle
to
their
attainment
of
the
dominion
they
aimed
at
a
dominion
as
universal
as
that
of
rome
and
so
intoxicated
were
they
with
that
vast
ambition
that
under
all
their
present
distress
and
danger
they
haughtily
rejected
every
overture
for
a
treaty
or
a
cessation
of
arms
that
the
war
was
a
just
and
necessary
measure
advised
by
the
parliament
itself
from
the
conviction
that
at
any
rate
est
such
a
be
destroyed
and
that
therefore
the
king
may
well
say
it
was
their
war
which
had
never
been
begun
but
that
the
states
refused
him
satisfaction
because
they
believed
him
to
be
in
so
great
want
of
money
that
they
must
sit
down
under
any
affronts
but
the
parliament
always
disinclined
to
the
war
had
now
begun
to
view
it
with
absolute
aversion
and
though
moved
by
the
king
representations
of
the
embarrassed
condition
he
should
be
reduced
to
if
the
supply
were
refused
to
yield
a
subsidy
of
seventy
thousand
pounds
a
month
for
eighteen
months
they
forced
him
to
pay
a
high
price
for
their
complaisance
by
extorting
his
consent
to
the
test
act
by
the
operation
of
this
act
the
duke
of
york
the
inveterate
enemy
of
the
dutch
and
sir
thomas
clifford
the
minister
who
had
the
most
zealously
pushed
forward
the
business
of
the
war
were
forced
to
resign
their
offices
with
the
funds
granted
him
by
parliament
charles
was
enabled
to
complete
the
equipment
of
a
fleet
which
when
joined
to
a
squadron
of
french
ships
under
numbered
one
hundred
fifty
sail
the
prince
of
orange
had
wisely
continued
de
ruyter
in
the
command
of
the
fleet
as
of
the
provinces
with
almost
unlimited
instructions
and
suffered
himself
to
be
wholly
guided
by
him
in
naval
affairs
interfering
only
so
far
as
to
reinstate
tromp
in
the
office
of
admiral
under
the
college
of
amsterdam
and
to
effect
a
perfect
reconciliation
between
him
and
de
ruyter
a
matter
which
the
placable
and
magnanimous
temper
of
the
latter
rendered
of
easy
accomplishment
having
failed
in
a
scheme
of
blocking
up
the
thames
by
means
of
sinking
vessels
in
the
bed
of
that
river
de
ruyter
stationed
himself
at
schooneveldt
with
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
coast
of
zealand
against
a
meditated
descent
of
the
enemy
while
at
anchor
he
descried
the
hostile
fleet
approaching
but
a
calm
succeeded
by
rough
weather
prevented
them
for
some
days
from
coming
to
an
engagement
the
dutch
were
considerably
inferior
in
strength
to
the
allies
the
number
of
their
vessels
being
no
more
than
and
twelve
frigates
of
which
moreover
the
equipages
were
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
seamen
by
no
means
complete
but
this
deficiency
was
more
than
compensated
by
the
spirit
and
conduct
of
their
great
commander
the
weaker
our
fleet
is
observed
de
ruyter
in
answer
to
some
remark
made
to
him
on
the
subject
the
more
confidently
i
expect
a
victory
not
from
our
own
strength
but
from
the
arm
of
the
almighty
under
a
favorable
breeze
the
french
and
english
ships
bore
down
upon
their
unequal
antagonists
in
the
full
expectation
that
they
would
avoid
the
encounter
by
retiring
behind
the
of
flushing
the
dutch
however
firmly
awaited
the
shock
commenced
by
the
squadron
of
french
ships
which
on
this
occasion
had
been
placed
in
the
van
to
avoid
the
imputation
cast
upon
them
in
the
last
battle
they
engaged
with
that
of
tromp
whose
impetuous
firing
compelled
the
french
admiral
to
retire
for
a
time
but
quickly
rallying
he
returned
to
the
charge
with
such
vigor
that
tromp
was
obliged
to
remove
his
flag
on
four
different
vessels
successively
de
ruyter
meanwhile
had
engaged
the
red
squadron
commanded
by
prince
rupert
which
after
a
sharp
contest
he
threw
into
some
disorder
and
succeeded
in
cutting
off
a
considerable
number
of
ships
from
the
remainder
instead
however
of
pursuing
his
advantage
de
ruyter
becoming
aware
of
the
danger
of
his
rival
who
was
now
entirely
surrounded
by
the
enemy
hastened
to
his
rescue
on
seeing
him
approach
tromp
exclaimed
comrades
here
is
our
grandsire
a
pet
name
given
to
de
ruyter
among
the
sailors
coming
to
help
us
so
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
forsake
him
the
generous
aid
was
no
less
effectual
than
well
timed
since
the
enemy
astonished
at
his
unexpected
appearance
fell
back
i
am
pleased
to
see
he
said
that
our
enemies
still
fear
the
seven
provinces
the
name
of
the
vessel
which
carried
his
flag
the
fight
was
continued
with
unremitting
obstinacy
till
darkness
separated
the
combatants
when
the
dutch
found
that
they
had
gained
about
three
miles
upon
their
antagonists
that
the
issue
of
such
a
contest
should
be
doubtful
was
in
itself
equivalent
to
a
victory
on
the
side
of
the
dutch
a
victory
of
which
they
reaped
all
the
advantages
as
well
as
the
glory
since
besides
delivering
their
coasts
from
the
intended
invasion
their
loss
was
so
inconsiderable
that
within
a
week
the
fleet
was
able
to
put
to
sea
in
its
original
numbers
and
strength
another
engagement
fought
with
less
of
energy
and
resolution
on
the
side
of
the
english
than
usually
distinguished
them
terminated
in
their
retreat
toward
the
thames
which
de
ruyter
conceiving
to
be
a
feint
to
draw
the
dutch
fleet
off
their
coasts
he
declined
the
pursuit
the
movement
however
had
its
origin
in
a
far
different
cause
the
english
sailors
fully
participated
in
the
feelings
entertained
by
the
great
body
of
the
nation
who
viewed
the
aggrandizement
of
their
ally
with
jealousy
and
the
undeserved
misfortunes
of
their
enemy
with
pity
and
considered
every
advantage
gained
over
the
dutch
as
a
step
toward
the
completion
of
the
sinister
designs
they
suspected
their
own
sovereign
of
harboring
against
their
religion
and
liberties
they
accordingly
made
no
concealment
of
their
reluctance
to
fight
longer
in
such
a
quarrel
it
was
now
become
evident
to
the
government
that
the
only
mode
of
reconciling
the
people
in
any
degree
to
the
present
state
of
things
was
the
execution
of
some
brilliant
achievement
which
should
flatter
their
national
vanity
and
kindle
their
ambition
or
lead
to
the
acquisition
of
spoil
sufficiently
considerable
to
afford
some
sensible
assistance
in
supporting
the
war
a
descent
on
holland
was
therefore
resolved
on
or
if
that
were
found
impracticable
it
was
proposed
to
intercept
the
indian
fleet
whose
arrival
was
hourly
expected
with
this
view
a
formidable
fleet
of
one
hundred
fifty
sail
made
its
appearance
in
the
texel
and
was
met
by
de
ruyter
about
five
miles
from
the
village
of
the
helder
the
dutch
though
far
inferior
in
number
having
only
vessels
convinced
that
this
struggle
was
to
be
the
most
desperate
and
the
last
prepared
themselves
for
it
as
men
who
had
everything
at
stake
after
a
short
but
inspiring
harangue
de
ruyter
gave
the
signal
for
attack
as
if
with
a
presentiment
that
long
years
would
elapse
before
they
should
again
try
the
strength
of
each
other
arm
the
english
and
dutch
seemed
mutually
determined
to
leave
upon
the
minds
of
their
foes
an
ineffaceable
impression
of
their
skill
and
prowess
all
the
resources
which
ability
could
suggest
or
valor
execute
were
now
employed
each
admiral
engaged
with
the
antagonist
against
whom
it
had
before
been
his
fortune
to
contend
de
ruyter
attached
himself
to
the
squadron
of
prince
rupert
tromp
attacked
sprague
who
commanded
the
blue
flag
while
bankert
was
opposed
to
the
french
the
latter
however
after
a
short
skirmish
on
the
part
of
rear
admiral
martel
who
was
unacquainted
with
the
secret
orders
given
to
the
commander
dropped
off
to
a
distance
nor
could
all
the
signals
made
by
prince
rupert
induce
them
to
take
any
further
share
in
the
fight
bankert
therefore
joined
de
ruyter
who
was
engaged
in
a
terrific
contest
with
the
squadron
of
prince
rupert
the
firing
was
kept
up
for
several
hours
without
cessation
the
discharges
from
the
cannon
of
the
dutch
vessels
being
it
was
said
as
rapid
as
those
of
musketry
and
in
proportion
of
three
to
one
to
those
of
the
enemy
tromp
whose
actions
always
reflected
more
honor
on
his
courage
than
conduct
separated
himself
as
was
his
custom
from
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
and
pressed
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
he
had
sustained
a
continued
cannonading
from
the
vessel
of
sprague
for
upward
of
three
hours
without
a
single
one
of
his
crew
being
wounded
when
de
ruyter
who
had
forced
prince
rupert
to
retire
came
to
his
assistance
the
prince
on
the
other
side
joined
admiral
sprague
and
the
fight
was
renewed
with
increased
ardor
the
vessel
of
tromp
was
so
damaged
that
he
was
obliged
to
remove
his
flag
on
board
of
another
sprague
was
reduced
to
a
similar
necessity
of
quitting
his
ship
the
royal
prince
for
the
george
which
ere
long
was
so
much
disabled
that
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
to
a
third
but
the
boat
in
which
he
was
passing
being
struck
by
a
sank
and
himself
and
several
others
were
drowned
toward
the
close
of
evening
one
english
was
on
fire
and
two
foundered
not
a
single
was
lost
on
the
side
of
the
dutch
but
both
fleets
were
so
much
damaged
as
to
be
unable
to
renew
the
engagement
on
the
next
morning
each
side
as
usual
returned
thanks
for
the
victory
to
which
however
the
english
failed
to
establish
their
claim
neither
by
accomplishing
the
projected
invasion
or
intercepting
the
east
india
fleet
the
whole
of
which
except
one
vessel
reached
the
ports
in
safety
in
the
more
distant
quarters
of
the
world
the
war
was
carried
on
with
various
success
the
french
captured
the
ports
of
trincomalee
in
ceylon
and
thomas
on
the
coast
of
coromandel
which
were
however
recovered
in
the
next
year
and
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
on
curajao
the
english
possessed
themselves
of
the
island
of
tobago
and
seized
four
merchantmen
returning
from
india
but
on
the
other
hand
the
states
admiral
evertson
made
himself
master
of
new
york
and
attacking
the
newfoundland
ships
took
or
destroyed
no
less
than
and
returned
to
holland
laden
with
booty
the
king
of
france
meanwhile
well
satisfied
to
have
secured
at
so
easy
a
rate
a
powerful
diversion
of
the
forces
of
holland
and
the
mutual
enfeebling
of
the
two
most
formidable
maritime
powers
of
europe
cared
little
how
the
affairs
of
his
ally
prospered
so
that
he
had
been
enabled
to
pursue
the
career
of
his
conquests
on
land
marching
in
person
at
the
head
of
his
troops
he
laid
siege
to
maestricht
a
town
famous
for
its
gallant
defence
against
the
duke
of
parma
in
but
which
now
notwithstanding
several
brisk
and
murderous
sallies
capitulated
in
less
than
a
month
with
this
achievement
the
campaign
of
louis
ended
the
progress
of
his
arms
and
the
development
of
his
schemes
of
ambition
had
now
raised
him
up
a
phalanx
of
enemies
such
as
not
even
his
presumption
could
venture
to
despise
he
had
planned
and
executed
his
conquests
in
full
reliance
on
the
cooperation
or
neutrality
of
the
neighboring
powers
and
found
himself
in
no
condition
to
retain
them
in
defiance
of
their
actual
hostility
he
had
from
the
first
been
strongly
advised
by
condé
and
turenne
to
destroy
the
fortifications
of
the
less
important
towns
retaining
so
many
only
of
the
larger
as
to
insure
the
subjection
of
the
provinces
he
had
however
deemed
it
more
consonant
to
his
glory
to
follow
the
advice
of
louvois
in
preserving
all
his
conquests
entire
and
had
thus
been
obliged
to
disperse
a
large
portion
of
his
army
into
garrisons
leaving
the
remainder
thinned
moreover
by
sickness
and
desertion
wholly
insufficient
to
make
head
against
the
increasing
number
of
his
opponents
he
therefore
came
to
the
mortifying
resolution
of
abandoning
the
united
provinces
the
possession
of
which
he

with
so
much
pride
this
auspicious
dawn
of

was
followed
by
the
long
and
ardently
desired
peace
with

of

battle
in
which
as
the
english
declared
themselves
and
the
dutch
had
been
made
the
gladiators
for
the
french
spectators
had
more
than
ever
disgusted
that
nation
with
the
alliance
of
an
ambitious
and
selfish
monarch
who
they
perceived
was
but
gratifying
his
own
rapacity
at
the
expense
of
their
blood
and
treasure
spain
had
threatened
a
rupture
with
england
unless
she
would
consent
to
a
reasonable
peace
and
even
sweden
herself
had
declared
during
the
conferences
at
cologne
that
she
should
be
constrained
to
adopt
a
similar
course
if
the
king
of
france
persisted
in
extending
his
conquests
should
a
war
with
these
nations
occur
the
english
saw
themselves
deprived
of
the
valuable
commerce
they
carried
on
in
their
ports
to
be
transferred
most
probably
to
the
united
provinces
in

to
which
consideration
their
navigation
had
already
sustained
excessive
injury
from
the
privateering
of
the
zealanders
who
had
captured
it
is
said
no
less
than
hundred
english
these
and
various
other
causes
had
provoked
the
parliament
to
use
expressions
of
the
highest
indignation
at
the
measures
of
the
court
and
to
a
peremptory
refusal
of
further
supplies
for
the
war
unless
the
dutch
by
their
obstinacy
in
rejecting
terms
of
peace
should
render
its
continuance
unavoidable
aware
of
this
disposition
the
states
had
addressed
a
letter
to
the
king
which
with
sufficient
adroitness
they
had
contrived
should
arrive
precisely
at
the
meeting
of
parliament
offering
the
king
restitution
of
all
the
places
they
had
gained
during
the
war
and
satisfaction
with
respect
to
the

or
any
other
matter
they
had
not
already
ordered
according
to
his
wishes
this
communication
received
with
feelings
of
extreme
irritation
by
the
court
had
all
the
effect
intended
on
the
house
of
commons
it
was
in
vain
that
the
king
complained
of
the
personal
insults
offered
him
by
the
dutch
in
vain
that
the
chancellor
expatiated
on
their
obstinacy
arrogance
and
enmity
to
the
english
and
that
the
court
party
remonstrated
against
the
imprudence
of
exposing
england
defenceless
to
the
power
of
her
haughty
enemy
the
parliament
persisted
in
refusing
the
solicited
supply
voted
the
standing
army
a
grievance
bitterly
complained
of
the
french

and
resolved
that
his

obviating
the

by
yielding
the
honor
of

manner
they
now
agreed
that
all
their

translated

during
the
early
colonization
of
new
france
in
the
era
of
count
frontenac
a
remarkable
spirit
of
adventure
and
discovery
manifested
itself
in
canada
among
both
clerics
and
laymen
this
enterprise
in
seeking
to
open
up
and
colonize
the
country
indeed
showed
itself
under
each
successive
governor
from
the
first
settlement
of
québec
in
down
to
the
fall
in
of
the
renowned
capital
on
the

in
the
entailed
arduous
labor
full
as
it
was
of
hazard
and
peril
the
pathfinders
of
empire
in
the
new
world
besides
laymen
were
largely
the
jesuit
missionaries
this
spirit
of
adventure
specially
began
to
show
itself
in
the
colony
at
the
period
when
talon
became
intendant
when
the
government
of
new
france
at
the
time
of
louis
xiv
minister
colbert
became
vested
directly
in
the
french
crown
through
talon
instrumentality
the
colony
revived
and
by
his
policy
its
commerce
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
company
of
monopolists
was
in
time
set
free
from
many
of
its
restrictions
before
talon
quitted
the
country
he
took
steps
to
extend
the
dominion
of
france
in
the
new
world
toward
hudson
bay
and
westward
in
the
direction
of
the
great
lakes
in
he
despatched
a
royal
commissioner
to
sault
ste
marie
at
the
foot
of
lake
superior
to
assemble
the
indians
of
the
region
and
induce
them
to
place
themselves
under
the
protection
and
aid
the
commerce
of
the
french
king
while
thus
engaged
the
commissioner
heard
of
the
mississippi
river
from
the
indians
and
talon
intrusted
the
task
of
tracking
its
waters
to
father
marquette
and
to
joliet
a
merchant
of
québec
with
infinite
toil
these
two
adventurous
spirits
reached
the
great
river
they
were
in
search
of
and
explored
it
as
far
south
as
the
arkansas
here
unfriendly
indian
tribes
compelled
them
to
return
without
being
permitted
to
trace
the
mighty
stream
to
its
outlet
this
however
is
supposed
to
have
been
accomplished
in
by
robert
cavalier
sieur
de
la
salle
a
daring
young
frenchman
who
descended
the
mississippi
it
is
currently
believed
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
naming
the
whole
region
louisiana
in
honor
of
louis
xiv
whether
la
salle
actually
explored
the
great
river
to
its
mouth
is
among
historians
still
a
moot
point
it
is
supposed
that
early
in
his
adventures
he
retraced
his
steps
and
returned
to
canada
where
as
well
as
in
france
he
had
numerous
detractors
among
whom
was
de
la
barre
the
then
governor
of
new
france
it
is
known
that
he
was
soon
again
in
québec
to
meet
his
enemies
which
he
did
successfully
after
which
he
proceeded
to
france
here
he
was
royally
received
by
the
king
and
as
a
proof
of
the
confidence
in
him
la
salle
was
intrusted
with
the
command
of
a
colonizing
expedition
which
was
sent
to
louisiana
by
sea
this
expedition
never
reached
its
destination
for
differences
with
the
commander
of
the
vessels
beaujeu
interfered
with
the
direction
of
the
expedition
the
mouths
of
the

it
seems
were
passed
and
the

of

now
dogged
the
footsteps
for
beaujeu
ran
one
of
the
ships
on
the
rocks
and
then
deserted
with
another
la
salle
and
some
of
his
more
trusty
followers
were
left
to
their
fate
which
was
a
cruel
one
for
disease
broke
out
in
the
ranks
and
famine
and
savage
foes
made
havoc
among
the
survivors
his
colony
being
reduced
to

persons
la

set
out
overland
with
sixteen
men
for
canada
to
procure
recruits
on
the
way
his
companions
mutinied
put
la

to
death
and
but
a
handful
of
the
party
reached
canada
the
remainder
perishing
in
the
wilderness
were
we
to
express
in
the
briefest
of
terms
the
motives
which
induced
the
leading
european
races
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
who
came
to
the
americas
we
should
say
that
the
spaniards
went
thither
in
quest
of
gold
the
english
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
civil
and
religious
freedom
the
french
in
view
of
propagating
the
gospel
among
the
aborigines
accordingly
we
find
from
the
beginning
in
the
annals
of
new
france
religious
interests
overlying
all
others
the
members
of
the
society
of
jesus
becoming
discredited
among
the
nations
of
europe
for
their
subserviency
to
power
usually
exalting
the
rights
of
kings
but
at
all
times
inculcating
submission
both
by
kings
and
their
subjects
to
the
roman
pontiffs
individual
jesuits
we
say
whatever
may
have
been
their
demerits
as
members
of
the
confraternity
in
europe
or
in
south
america
did
much
to
redeem
these
by
their
apostolic
labors
in
the
wilderness
of
the
northern
continent
cheerfully
encountering
as
they
did
every
form
of
suffering
braving
the
cruelest
tortures
and
even
welcoming
death
as
the
expected
seal
of
their
martyrdom
for
the
cause
of
christ
and
for
the
advancement
of
civilization
among
barbarous
nations

of

fathers
radiated
in

directions
through

region
inhabited
by

territory
along

and
down

scantily
equipped
as
it
seemed
to
the
worldly
eye
with
a
breviary
around
the
neck
and
a
crucifix
in

the
missionary
set
forth
and
became
a
pioneer
for
the
most
adventurous
secular
explorers
of
the
desert
to
such
our
forefathers
owed
their
best
earliest
knowledge
of
vast
regions
to
whose
savage
inhabitants
they
imparted
the
glad
tidings
of
the
gospel
and
smoothed
the
way
for
native
alliances
with
their
compatriots
of
the
laity
of

such
devotedness
at
once
heroic
and
humble
could
not
but
confound
worldly
philosophy
while
it
has
gained
for
the
members
of
the
order
the
admiration
of
many
protestants
thus
we
have
the
candid
testimony
of
bancroft
the
able
historian
of
the
english
plantations
in
this
continent
that
the
annals
of
missionary
labors
are
inseparably
connected
with
the
origin
of
all
the
establishments
of
french
america
not
a
cape
was
doubled
nor
a
stream
discovered
that
a
jesuit
did
not
show
the
way
on
the
other
hand
there
were
instances
where
secular
explorers
seeking
to
illustrate
their
names
by
great
discoveries
or
to
enrich
themselves
by
traffic
opened
a
way
for
the
of
the

most
celebrated
of
such
were
champlain
nicolet
perrot
joliet
la

la
verendrye

passed
overland
from

the
eastern
atlantic
seaboard

the
chaudifere

descending
the

did
good
service
to
the

preserving
for

the
amity

brave

the

the

attained
a
certainty
that

did
exist
and
they
could
in

trace
its
probable
course
it
appeared
certain
from
the
recent
search
made
for
it
in
northerly
and
eastern
directions
that
its

so
voluminous
as
the

asserted
must
at

find

either
in

of

or
in

talon
who
took
a
strong
interest
in

recommended
captain
poulet
a
skilful
mariner
of
dieppe
to
verify
the
passage
from

to

through

of
magellan
he
induced
de

to
send
joliet
into

where
the
great

yet
unseen
must
take
its
rise
and
follow

reached

the

thus
employed
on
a

which
interested
everyone
at

was
a
man
of
talent
educated
in
the
jesuits
college
of

probably
in
view
of
entering
the
church
but
who
had
gone
into
the
peltry
trade
he
had
travelled
much
in
the
countries
around

and
gained
great
experience
of
the
natives
especially
those
of
the
ottawa
tribes
joliet
and

marquette
set
out
together
in
the
year
the
latter
who
had
lived
among
the
potowatami
indians
as
a
missionary
and
gained
their
affections
was
forewarned
by
them
of
the
perils
they
alleged
which
would
beset
his
steps
in
so
daring
an
enterprise
admonishing
him
and
his
companion
that
the
people
of
the
farther
countries
would
allow
no
stranger
to
pass
through
them
that
travellers
were
always
pillaged
at
the
least
that
the
great
river
swarmed
with
monsters
who
devoured
men
and
that
the
climate
was
so
hot
that
human
flesh
could
not
endure
it
footnote
there
was
some
foundation
for
this
report
as
alligators
abounded
at
that
time
in
the
lower
waters
of
the
river
having
progressed
to
the
farthest
horde
over
the
fox
river
where
père
allouez
was
known
and
the
extremest
point
yet
touched
by
any
european
the
adventurers
found
the
people
of
the
divers
tribes
living
together
in
harmony
the
kikapoos
mascoutins
and
miâmis
they
accorded
the
strangers
a
kind
reception
and
furnished
guides
to
direct
the
party

was
composed
of
nine
persons
in

marquette
with
five
other
whites
and
two

on

they
set
out
bearing
two
light
canoes
on

shoulders
for
crossing
the
narrow
portage
which
separates
the
fox
river
from
that
of

where
the

after
following
a
southerly
takes
a
western
course
here
their
indian
guides
left
them
fearing
to
go
farther
arrived
at
the
lower
wisconsin
they
embarked
and
glided
down
the
stream
which
led
the
travellers
through
a
solitude
they
remarking
that
the
levels
around
them
presented
an
unbroken
expanse
of
luxuriant
herbage
or
forests
of
lofty
trees
their
progress
was
slow
for
it
was
not
till
the
tenth
day
that
they
attained
the
confluence
of
the
wisconsin
and
mississippi
but
the
goal
was
surely
if
tardily
attained
they
were
now
floating
on
the
bosom
of
the
father
of
waters
a
fact
they
at
once
felt
assured
of
and
fairly
committed
themselves
to
the
course
of
the
doubled
current
this
event
constituted
an
epoch
in
american
annals
the
two
canoes
says

with

outspread
under

their
way
impelled
by

along

they
passed
around

otherwhiles
again
their
course
lay
through
the
vast
plains
of
illinois
and
iowa
covered
with
magnificent
woods
or
dotted
with
clumps
of

scattered
about

it
was
not
till

voyagers
had
descended
sixty

of

discovered

signs
of

presence
of

but
at
length
observing
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
a
they
followed
it
for
six
miles
and
arrived
at
a
horde
bourgade
situated
on
a
river
called
by
the
natives
moingona
an
appellation
afterward
corrupted
into
rivière
des
moines
seeing
no
one
the
visitors
hollowed
lustily
and
four
old
men
answered
the
call
bearing
in
hand
the
calumet
of
peace
we
are
illinois
said
the
indians
you
are
our
we
bid
you
welcome
they
had
never
before
seen
any
whites
but
had
heard
mention
of
the
french
and
long
wished
to
form
an
alliance
with
them
against
the
iroquois
whose
hostile
excursions
extended
even
to
their
country
they
were
glad
to
hear
from
joliet
that
the
colonists
had
lately
chastised
those
whom
no
others
could
vanquish
and
feasted
the
visitors
to
manifest
their
gratitude
as
well
as
respect
the
chief
of
the
tribe
with
some
hundreds
of
his
warriors
escorted
the
party
to
their
canoes
and
as
a
mark
of
parting
esteem
he
presented
a
calumet
ornamented
with
feathers
of
various
colors
a
this
held
inviolable
among
the
aborigines
the
voyagers
again
on
their
way
were
forewarned
of
the
confluence
of
the
missouri
with
the
main
stream
by
the
noise
of
its
discharging
waters
forty
leagues
lower
they
reached
the
influx
of
the
ohio
in
the
territory
of
the
chouanows
by
degrees
the
region
they
traversed
changed
its
aspect
instead
of
vast
prairies
the
voyagers
only
saw
thick
forests
around
them
inhabited
by
savages
whose
language
was
to
them
unknown
in
quitting
the
southern
line
of
the
ohio
they
left
the
algonquin
family
of
aborigines
behind
and
had
come
upon
a
region
of
nomads
the
chickasaw
nation
being
here
denizens
of
the
forest
the
dacotas
or
sioux
frequented
the
riverain
lands
in
the
southern
region
watered
by
the
great
flood
thus
interpreters
were
needed
by
the
natives
who
wished
to
parley
from
either
bank
of
the
mississippi
each
speaking
one
of
two
both
distinct
from
those
of
the
hurons
and
algonquins
much
of
the
latter
being
familiar
to
joliet
and
others
of
the
party
continuing
their
descent
the
confluence
of
the
arkansas
with
the
mississippi
was
attained
the
voyagers
were
now
under
the
parallel
of
north
latitude
at
a
point
of
the
reported
to
have
been
previously
reached
from
the
opposite
direction
by
the
celebrated
spanish
mariner
de
soto
here
the
illinois
chief
present
stood
the
party
in
good
stead
for
on
exhibiting
his
ornate
calumet
they
were
treated
with
profuse
kindness
bread
made
of
maize
was
offered
by
the
chief
of
the
horde
located
at
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
of
steel
in
use
by
the
natives
gave
intimation
that
they
traded
with
europeans
and
that
the
spanish
settlements
on
the
bay
of
mexico
were
probably
not
far
off
the
waxing
summer
heats
too
gave
natural
corroboration
to
the
same
inferences
the
party
had
now
in
fact
attained
to
a
region
without
a
winter
unless
as
such
be
reckoned
that
part
of
its
year
known
as
the
rainy
season
it
now
became
expedient
to
call
a
halt
for
the
stored
provisions
were
beginning
to
fail
and
chance
supplies
could
not
be
depended
upon
in
such
a
wilderness
as
the
bold
adventurers
had
already
traversed
and
they
were
still
more
uncertain
as
to
what
treatment
they
might
receive
from
savage
populations
if
they
proceeded
farther
one
thing
was
made
plain
to
their
perceptions
the
mississippi
afforded
no
passage
to
the
east
indian
seas
they
rightly
concluded
also
that
it
found
its
sea
outlet
in
the
bay
of
mexico
not
the
pacific
ocean
they
had
therefore
now
done
enough
to
entitle
them
to
the
grateful
thanks
of
their
compatriots
and
for
the
names
of
their
two
leaders
to
take
a
permanent
place
in
the
annals
of
geographical
discovery
the
task
of
ascending
the
great
river
must
have
been
arduous
and
the
return
voyage
protracted
arrived
at
the
point
where
it
is
joined
by
the
illinois
they
left
it
for
that
stream
which
ascending
for
a
part
of
its
lower
course
père
marquette
elected
to
remain
with
the
natives
of
tribes
located
near
to
its
banks
while
joliet
with
the
rest
of
the
party
passed
overland
to
chicago
thence
he
proceeded
to
québec
and
reported
his
proceedings
to
the
governor
talon
at
that
time
being
in
france
this
duty
he
had
to
perform
orally
having
lost
all
his
papers
when
shooting
the
rapids
of
the
lawrence
above
montreal
he
afterward
drew
up
a
written
report
with
a
tracing
of
his
route
from
memory
the
encouragement
the
intendant
procured
for
the
enterprise
fairly
entitles
him
to
share
its
glory
with
those
who
so
ably
carried
it
out
for
we
can
not
attach
too
much
honor
to
the
memory
of
statesmen
who
turn
to
account
their
opportunities
of
patronizing
useful
adventure
joliet
received
in
property
the
island
of
anticosti
as
a
reward
for
his
western
discoveries
and
for
an
exploratory
voyage
he
made
to
hudson
bay
he
was
also
nominated
and
got
enfeoffed
in
a
seigniory
near
montreal
expecting
to
reap
great
advantage
from
anticosti
as
a
fishing
and
station
he
built
a
fort
thereon
but
after
living
some
time
on
the
island
with
his
family
he
was
obliged
to
abandon
it
his
patronymic
was
adopted
as
the
name
of
a
mountain
situated
near
the
rivère

returned
soon
afterward

resumed
his
missionary
labors
among

then
at

gunpowder
i
can
not

my

you
can

for
your

two
thousand

nation
besides
the

and

present
his
bodily
powers
however
were
now
wellnigh
exhausted
he
decided
to
return
to
mackinac
but
while
coasting
the
lower
shores
of
lake
michigan
feeling
that
his
supreme
hour
was
nigh
he
caused
the
people
in
his
canoe
to
set
him
ashore
having
obtained
for
him
the
shelter
of
a
hut
formed
of
branches
he
there
died
the
death
of
the
righteous
his
companions
interred
his
remains
near
the
river
which
yet
bears
his
name
and
set
up
a
crucifix
to
mark
the
spot
thus
ended
amid
the
solitudes
of
the
western
wilderness
the
valuable
existence
of
one
whose
name
too
little
known
to
his
own
age
will
be
remembered
when
hundreds
of
those
which
however
loudly
sounded
in
the
present
shall
have
passed
into
utter
oblivion

observes
that
according
to
some
authorities
la

some
time
between
the
years
and
descended
the
mississippi
as
far
as
the
arkansas
by
the
river
ohio
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
story
is
a
mere
figment
the
news
of
the
discovery
of
the
mississippi
made
a
great
sensation
in
canada
and
eclipsed
for
a
time
the
interest
attaching
to
other
explorations
of
the
age
which
were
becoming
more
and
more
rife
every
year
every
speculative
mind
was
set
to
work
as
was
usual
on
such
occasions
to
calculate
the
material
advantages
which
might
result
first
to
the
colonists
and
next
to
their
from
access
being
obtained
to
a
second
gigantic
waterway
through
the
territories
of
new
france
serving
as
it
virtually
might
in
times
to
come
as
a
complement

completing

still
as

by

upon

some
persons
had
their
doubts
about

of

therefore
still

committed
to
their

their
most
audacious

impatient
to
seize
every

chance
presented
for
distinguishing
himself

occurred
he
had
been

some
years
in

so
promising

a

of
the

determined
to

both
his

a
young

he
came
to

full
of

had
conceived
of
seeking

by

northern
or
western
passage

set
about
making

for
himself
in

succeeded
in

discerned
in
him
qualities
somewhat
akin
to

with
the
aid
of
de

he
opened
a
factory
for
the
fur
traffic
at
lachine
near

he
gave

said
that
by
ascending
instead
of
descending
that
great

a
means
might
be
found
for

demurred

wonder
hailing
the

so
many
or
men

mind
footnote
some
authors
say
that
he
named
his
vessel
the
griffin
in
honor
of
the
frontenacs
the
supporters
in

were
two
griffins
where
all
is
so
uncertain
in
an
important
matter
a
third
suggestion
may
be
as
near
the
mark
as
the
first
two
as
the
norse

norman
bore
the
raven
for
a
standard
perhaps
la

adopted
the
raven
in
right
of
a
sovereignty
over
the
american
lakes
on
august
the
griffin
equipped
with
seven
guns
and
loaded
with
small
arms
and
goods
entered
lake
erie
when
la

started
for
detroit
which
he
reached
in
safety
after
a
few
days

he
gave
to
the
expansion
of
the
channel
between

huron
the
name
of
lake
ste

traversing
which
on
august
he
entered

five
days
later
he
reached
michilimackinac
after
having
encountered
a
violent
storm
such
as
are
not
unfrequent
in
that
locality
the
aborigines
of
the
country
were
not
less
moved
than
those
of
niagara
had
been
at
the
appearance
of
the
griffin
an
apparition
rendered
terrible
as
well
as
puzzling
when
the
sound
of
her
cannon
boomed
along
the
lake
and
reverberated
from
its
shores
on
attaining
to
the
chapel
of
the
ottawa
tribe
at
the
mission
station
he
landed
and
attended
mass
continuing
his
voyage
some
time
in
september
he
reached
the
baie
des
puants
on
the
western
lake
board
of
michigan
where
he
cast
anchor
so
far
the
first
ship
navigation
of
the
great
canadian
lakes
had
been
a
triumph
but
the
end
was
not
yet
and
it
proved
to
be
disastrous
for
la
salle
hearing
that
his
creditors
had
in
his
absence
confiscated
his
possessions
despatched
the
griffin
loaded
with
peltry
to
niagara
probably
in
view
of
redeeming

of

and

passing
to
joseph
at
the
lower
end
of
lake
michigan
whither
he
had
ordered
that
the
griffin
should
proceed
on
her
proposed
second
voyage
from
niagara
he
laid
the
foundations
of
a
fort
on
the
crest
of
a
steep
height
washed
on
two
sides
by
the
river
of
the
miâmis
and
defended
on
another
side
by
a
deep
ravine
he
set
buoys
at
the
entrance
of
the
stream
for
the
direction
of
the
crew
of
the
anxiously
expected
vessel
upon
whose
safety
depended
in
part
the
continuation
of
his
enterprises
sending
on
some
skilful
hands
to
michilimackinac
to
pilot
her
on
the
lake
the
vessel
not
appearing
and
winter
being
near
he
set
out
for
the
country
of
the
illinois
indians
leaving
a
few
men
in
charge
of
the
fort
and
taking
with
him
the

gabriel
hennepin
and
zenobe
also
some
private

tonti
who
was
likewise
of
the
party
having
rejoined
his
principal
but
without
the

he
was
sent
to
seek
as
he
could
not
find
them
the

thus
constituted
arrived
toward
the
close
of

at
a
deserted

situated
near
the

of
the
illinois

in
the

which
still
bears

without

he
descended
that

as
far
as

called
by
hennepin
pimiteoui
on
the
margin
of
which
he
found
encamped
a
numerous

these

naturally
gentle
yet
turned
unfriendly

at

on

from

at
the
appearance
of

treated
them
with
great

one
of

to
the

of
the

their

these

were
glad
to
learn
that
la

meant
to
form

in
their

the

the

harassed
as
they
were
by

that
the

the

remarked
that
the

formed
the

of
their

with
mats
of

reeds
lined
and
sewed
together
all
those
the

saw
were
tall
robust
in

and
dexterous
with
the

but
the

has
been
stigmatized
by
some
early

as
cowardly
lazy
debauched
and
without

at

four

this

la

interests
were
getting
from
bad

at

but
for
rightly
understanding
the
events
which
at
last
obliged
him
to
abandon
that
post
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
state
of
his
affairs
in
canada
and
to
advert
to
the
jealousies
which
other
traffickers
cherished
regarding
his
monopolizing
projects
in
the
western
regions
of
the
continent
he
came
to
the
colony
as
we
have
seen
a
fortuneless
adventurer
highly
recommended
indeed
while
the
special
protection
he
obtained
from
the
governor
with
the
titular
and
more
solid
favors
he
obtained
at
court
made
him
a
competitor
to
all
other
commercialists
whom
it
was
impossible
to
contend
with
directly
underhand
means
of
opposition
therefore
and
these
not
always
the
fairest
were
put
in
play
to
damage
his
interests
and
if
possible
effect
his
ruin
for
instance
feuds
were
stirred
up
against
him
among
the
savage
tribes
and
inducements
held
out
to
his
own
people
to
desert
him
they
even
induced
the
iroquois
and
the
miâmis
to
take
up
arms
against
the
illinois
his
allies
besides
this
hostility
to
him
within
new
france
he
had
to
face
the
opposition
of
the
colonists
who
resisted
the
realization
of
his
projects
for
nationally
selfish
reasons
thus
they
encouraged
the
iroquois
to
attack

of
the

a
measure
which
greatly
increased
the
difficulties
of
a
position
already
almost
untenable
in
a
word
the
odds
against
him
became
too
great
and
he
was
constrained
to
retire
from
the
high
game
he
wished
to
play
out
which
indeed
was
certainly
to
the
disadvantage
of

with

having
learned
that

persuaded
to
return
again
to
his
former
employment
this
indian
accused
philip
anew
of
being
engaged
in
a
secret
hostile
plot
in
accordance
with
indian
ideas
the
treacherous
informer
was
waylaid
and
killed
three
of
philip
men
suspected
of
having
killed
him
were
arrested
by
the
plymouth
authorities
and
in
accordance
with
english
ideas
were
tried
for
murder
by
a
jury
half
english
half
indians
convicted
upon
very
slender
evidence
and
hanged
philip
retaliated
by
plundering
the
houses
nearest
mount
hope
presently
he
attacked
swanzey
and
killed
several
of
the
inhabitants
plymouth
took
measures
for
raising
a
military
force
the
neighboring
colonies
were
sent
to
for
assistance
thus
by
the
impulse
of
suspicion
on
the
one
side
and
passion
on
the
other
new
england
became
suddenly
engaged
in
a
war
very
disastrous
to
the
colonists
and
utterly
ruinous
to
the
native
tribes
the
lust
of
gain
in
spite
of
all
laws
to
prevent
it
had
partially
furnished
the
indians
with
and
they
were
now
far
more
formidable
enemies
than
they
had
been
in
the
days
of
the
pequots
of
this
the
colonists
hardly
seem
to
have
thought
now
as
then
confident
of
their
superiority
and
comparing
themselves
to
the
lord
chosen
people
driving
the
heathen
out
of
the
land
they
rushed
eagerly
into
the
contest
without
a
single
effort
at
the
preservation
of
peace
indeed
their
pretensions
hardly
admitted
of
it
philip
was
denounced
as
a
rebel
in
arms
against
his
lawful
superiors
with
whom
it
would
be
folly
and
weakness
to
treat
on
any
terms
short
of
absolute
submission
a
body
of
volunteers
horse
and
foot
raised
in
massachusetts
marched
under
major
savage
four
days
after
the
attack
on
swanzey
to
join
the
plymouth
forces
after
one
or
two
slight
skirmishes
they
penetrated
to
the
wampanoag
villages
at
mount
hope
but
found
them
empty
and
deserted
philip
and
his
warriors
conscious
of
their
inferiority
had
abandoned
their
homes
if
the
narragansetts
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
did
not
openly
join
the
wampanoags
they
would
at
least
be
likely
to
afford
shelter
to
their
women
and
children
the
troops
were
therefore
ordered
into
the
narragansett
country
accompanied
by
commissioners
to
demand
assurances
of
peaceful
intentions
and
a
promise
to
deliver
up
all
fugitive
enemies
of
the
colonists
pledges
which
the
narragansetts
felt
themselves
constrained
to
give
arrived
at
taunton
on
their
return
from
the
narragansett
country
news
came
that
philip
and
his
warriors
had
been
discovered
by
church
of
plymouth
colony
collected
in
a
great
swamp
at
pocasset
now
tiverton
the
southern
district
of
the
wampanoag
country
whence
small
parties
sallied
forth
to
burn
and
plunder
the
neighboring
settlements
after
a
march
of
eighteen
miles
having
reached
the
designated
spot
the
soldiers
found
there
a
hundred
wigwams
lately
built
but
empty
and
deserted
the
indians
having
retired
deep
into
the
swamp
the
colonists
followed
but
the
ground
was
soft
the
thicket
was
difficult
to
penetrate
the
companies
were
soon
thrown
into
disorder
each
man
fired
at
every
bush
he
saw
shake
thinking
an
indian
might
lay
concealed
behind
it
and
several
were
thus
wounded
by
their
own
friends
when
night
came
on
the
assailants
retired
with
the
loss
of
sixteen
men
the
swamp
continued
to
be
watched
and
guarded
but
philip
broke
through
not
without
some
loss
and
escaped
into
the
country
of
the
nipmucks
in
the
interior
of
massachusetts
that
tribe
had
already
commenced
hostilities
by
attacking
mendon
they
waylaid
and
killed
captain
hutchinson
a
son
of
the
famous
hutchinson
and
sixteen
out
of
a
party
of
twenty
sent
from
boston
to
brookfield
to
parley
with
them
attacking
brookfield
itself
they
burned
it
except
one
fortified
house
the
inhabitants
were
saved
by
major
willard
who
on
information
of
their
danger
came
with
a
troop
of
horse
from
lancaster
thirty
miles
through
the
woods
to
their
rescue
a
body
of
troops
presently
arrived
from
the
eastward
and
were
stationed
for
some
time
at
brookfield
the
colonists
now
found
that
by
driving
philip
to
extremity
they
had
roused
a
host
of
unexpected
enemies
the
river
indians
anticipating
an
intended
attack
upon
them
joined
the
assailants
deerfield
and
northfield
the
northernmost
towns
on
the
connecticut
river
settled
within
a
few
years
past
were
attacked
and
several
of
the
inhabitants
killed
and
wounded
captain
beers
sent
from
hadley
to
their
relief
with
a
convoy
of
provisions
was
surprised
near
northfield
and
slain
with
twenty
of
his
men
northfield
was
abandoned
and
burned
by
the
indians
the
english
at
first
says
gookin
thought
easily
to
chastise
the
insolent
doings
and
murderous
practice
of
the
heathen
but
it
was
found
another
manner
of
thing
than
was
expected
for
our
men
could
see
no
enemy
to
shoot
at
but
yet
felt
their
bullets
out
of
the
thick
bushes
where
they
lay
in
ambush
the
english
wanted
not
courage
or
resolution
but
could
not
discover
nor
find
an
enemy
to
fight
with
yet
were
galled
by
the
enemy
in
the
arts
of
ambush
and
surprise
with
which
the
indians
were
so
familiar
the
colonists
were
without
practice
it
is
to
the
want
of
this
experience
purchased
at
a
very
dear
rate
in
the
course
of
the
war
that
we
must
ascribe
the
numerous
surprises
and
defeats
from
which
the
colonists
suffered
at
its
commencement
driven
to
the
necessity
of
defensive
warfare
those
in
command
on
the
river
determined
to
establish
a
magazine
and
garrison
at
hadley
captain
lathrop
who
had
been
despatched
from
the
eastward
to
the
assistance
of

sent
with
eighty
men
the

to
guard
the
wagons
intended
to
convey
to
hadley
three
thousand
bushels
of
unthreshed
wheat
the
produce
of

fertile
deerfield
meadows
just
before
arriving
at

near
a
small
stream
still
known
as

brook
under
the
shadow
of
the
abrupt
conical
sugar
loaf
the
southern
termination
of
the
deerfield
mountain
lathrop
fell
into
an
ambush
and
after
a
brave
resistance
perished
there
with
all
his
company
captain
moseley
stationed
at
deerfield
marched
to
his
assistance
but
arrived
too
late
to
help
him
deerfield
was
abandoned
and
burned
by
the
indians
springfield
about
the
same
time
was
set
on
fire
but
was
partially
saved
by
the
arrival
with
troops
from

of
major
treat
successor
to
the
lately
deceased
mason
in
the
chief
command
of

connecticut
forces
an
attack
on
hatfield
was
vigorously
repelled
by
the
garrison
meanwhile
hostilities
were
spreading
the
indians
on
the
merrimac
began
to
attack
the
towns
in
their
vicinity
and
the
whole
of
massachusetts
was
soon
in
the
utmost
alarm
except
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
boston
the
country
still
remained
an
immense
forest
dotted
by
a
few
openings
the
frontier
settlements
could
not
be
defended
against
a
foe
familiar
with
localities
scattered
in
small
parties
skilful
in
concealment
and
watching
with
patience
for
some
unguarded
or
favorable
moment
those
settlements
were
mostly
broken
up
and
the
inhabitants
retiring
toward
boston
spread
everywhere
dread
and
intense
hatred
of
the
bloody
heathen
even
the
praying
indians
and
the
small
dependent
and
tributary
tribes
became
objects
of
suspicion
and
terror
they
had
been
employed
at
first
as
scouts
and
auxiliaries
and
to
good
advantage
but
some
few
less
confirmed
in
the
faith
having
deserted
to
the
enemy
the
whole
body
of
them
were
denounced
as
traitors
eliot
the
apostle
and
gookin
superintendent
of
the
subject
indians
exposed
themselves
to
insults
and
even
to
danger
by
their
efforts
to
stem
this
headlong
fury
to
which
several
of
the
magistrates
opposed
but
a
feeble
resistance
troops
were
sent
to
break
up
the
praying
villages
at
mendon
grafton
and
others
in
that
quarter
the
natick
indians
those
poor
despised
sheep
of
christ
as
gookin
affectionately
calls
them
were
hurried
off
to
deer
island
in
boston
harbor
where
they
suffered
excessively
from
a
severe
winter
a
part
of
the
praying
indians
of
plymouth
colony
were
confined
in
like
manner
on
the
islands
in
plymouth
harbor
not
content
with
realities
sufficiently
frightful
superstition
as
usual
added
bugbears
of
her
own
indian
bows
were
seen
in
the
sky
and
scalps
in
the
moon
the
northern
lights
became
an
object
of
terror
phantom
horsemen
careered
among
the
clouds
or
were
heard
to
gallop
invisible
through
the
air
the
howling
of
wolves
was
turned
into
a
terrible
omen
the
war
was
regarded
as
a
special
judgment
in
punishment
of
prevailing
sins
among
these
sins
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
after
consultation
with
the
elders
enumerated
neglect
in
the
training
of
the
children
of
church
members
pride
in
men
wearing
long
and
curled
hair
excess
in
apparel
naked
breasts
and
arms
and
superfluous
ribbons
the
toleration
of
quakers
hurry
to
leave
meeting
before
blessing
asked
profane
cursing
and
swearing
want
of
respect
for
parents
idleness
extortion
in
shopkeepers
and
mechanics
and
the
riding
from
town
to
town
of
unmarried
men
and
women
under
pretence
of
attending
lectures
a
sinful
custom
tending
to
lewdness
penalties
were
denounced
against
all
these
offences
and
the
persecution
of
the
quakers
was
again
renewed
a
quaker
woman
had
recently
frightened
the
old
south
congregation
in
boston
by
entering
that
clothed
in
sackcloth
with
ashes
on
her
head
her
feet
bare
and
her
face
blackened
intending
to
personify
the
with
which
she
threatened
the
colony
in
punishment
for
its
sins
about
the
time
of
the
first
collision
with
philip
the
tarenteens
or
eastern
indians
had
attacked
the
settlements
in
maine
and
new
hampshire
plundering
and
burning
the
houses
and
massacring
such
of
the
inhabitants
as
fell
into
their
hands
this
sudden
diffusion
of
hostilities
and
vigor
of
attack
from
opposite
quarters
made
the
colonists
believe
that
philip
had
long
been
plotting
and
had
gradually
matured
an
extensive
conspiracy
into
which
most
of
the
tribes
had
deliberately
entered
for
the
extermination
of
the
whites
this
belief
infuriated
the
colonists
and
suggested
some
very
questionable
proceedings
it
seems
however
to
have
originated
like
the
war
itself
from
mere
suspicions
the
same
griefs
pressed
upon
all
the
tribes
and
the
struggle
once
commenced
the
awe
which
the
colonists
inspired
thrown
off
the
greater
part
were
ready
to
join
in
the
contest
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
deliberate
concert
nor
in
fact
were
the
indians
united
had
they
been
so
the
war
would
have
been
far
more
serious
the
connecticut
tribes
proved
faithful
and
that
colony
remained
untouched
uncas
and
ninigret
continued
friendly
even
the
narragansetts
in
spite
of
so
many
former
provocations
had
not
yet
taken
up
arms
but
they
were
strongly
suspected
of
intention
to
do
so
and
were
accused
by
uncas
of
giving
notwithstanding
their
recent
assurances
aid
and
shelter
to
the
hostile
tribes
an
attempt
had
lately
been
made
to
revive
the
union
of
the
new
england
colonies
at
a
meeting
of
commissioners
those
from
plymouth
presented
a
narrative
of
the
origin
and
progress
of
the
present
hostilities
upon
the
strength
of
this
narrative
the
war
was
pronounced
just
and
necessary
and
a
resolution
was
passed
to
carry
it
on
at
the
joint
expense
and
to
raise
for
that
purpose
a
thousand
men
to
be
mounted
dragoons
if
the
narragansetts
were
not
crushed
during
the
winter
it
was
feared
they
might
break
out
openly
hostile
in
the
spring
and
at
a
subsequent
meeting
a
thousand
men
were
ordered
to
be
levied
to
coöperate
in
an
expedition
specially
against
them
the
winter
was
unfavorable
to
the
indians
the
leafless
woods
no
longer
concealed
their
lurking
attacks
the
frozen
surface
of
the
swamps
made
the
indian
fastnesses
accessible
to
the
colonists
the
forces
destined
against
the
narragansetts
six
companies
from
massachusetts
under
major
appleton
two
from
plymouth
under
major
bradford
and
five
from
connecticut
under
major
treat
were
placed
under
the
command
of
josiah
winslow
governor
of
plymouth
since
prince
death
son
of
that
edward
winslow
so
conspicuous
in
the
earlier
history
of
the
colony
the
massachusetts
and
plymouth
forces
marched
to
petasquamscot
on
the
west
shore
of
narragansett
bay
where
they
made
some
forty
prisoners
being
joined
by
the
troops
from
connecticut
and
guided
by
an
indian
deserter
after
a
march
of
fifteen
miles
through
a
deep
snow
they
approached
a
swamp
in
what
is
now
the
town
of
south
kingston
one
of
the
ancient
strongholds
of
the
narragansetts
driving
the
indian
scouts
before
them
and
penetrating
the
swamp
the
colonial
soldiers
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
indian
fort
built
on
a
rising
ground
in
the
morass
a
sort
of
island
of
two
or
three
acres
fortified
by
a
palisade
and
surrounded
by
a
close
hedge
a
rod
thick
there
was
but
one
entrance
quite
narrow
defended
by
a
tree
thrown
across
it
with
a
of
logs
in
front
and
other
on
the
flank
it
was
the
lord
day
but
that
did
not
hinder
the
attack
as
the
captains
advanced
at
the
heads
of
their
companies
the
indians
opened
a
galling
fire
under
which
many
fell
but
the
assailants
pressed
on
and
forced
the
entrance
a
desperate
struggle
ensued
the
colonists
were
once
driven
back
but
they
rallied
and
returned
to
the
charge
and
after
a
fight
became
masters
of
the
fort
fire
was
put
to
the
wigwams
near
six
hundred
in
number
and
all
the
horrors
of
the
pequot
massacre
were
renewed
the
corn
and
other
winter
stores
of
the
indians
were
consumed
and
not
a
few
of
the
old
men
women
and
children
perished
in
the
flames
in
this
bloody
contest
long
remembered
as
the
swamp
fight
the
colonial
loss
was
terribly
severe
six
captains
with
two
hundred
thirty
men
were
killed
or
wounded
and
at
night
in
the
midst
of
a
with
a
march
before
them
the
colonial
soldiers
abandoned
the
fort
of
which
the
indians
resumed
possession
but
their
wigwams
were
burned
their
provisions
destroyed
they
had
no
supplies
for
the
winter
their
loss
was
irreparable
of
those
who
survived
the
fight
many
perished
of
hunger
even
as
a
question
of
policy
this
attack
on
the
narragansetts
was
more
than
doubtful
the
starving
and
infuriated
warriors
scattered
through
the
woods
revenged
themselves
by

swept
the
entire

extremities
of

canochet
the
chief
sachem
said
to
have
been
a
son
of
miantonomoh
but
probably
his
nephew
had
ventured
to
his
old
haunts
to
procure
seed
corn
with
which
to
plant
the
rich
intervals
on
the
connecticut
abandoned
by
the
colonists
taken
prisoner
he
conducted
himself
with
all
that
haughty
firmness
esteemed
by
the
indians
as
the
height
of
magnanimity
being
offered
his
life
on
condition
of
bringing
about
a
peace
he
scorned
the
proposal
his
tribe
would
perish
to
the
last
man
rather
than
become
servants
to
the
english
when
ordered
to
prepare
for
death
he
replied
i
like
it
well
i
shall
die
before
my
heart
is
soft
or
i
shall
have
spoken
anything
unworthy
of
myself
two
indians
were
appointed
to
shoot
him
and
his
head
was
cut
off
and
sent
to
hartford
the
colonists
had
suffered
severely
men
women
and
children
had
perished
by
the
bullets
of
the
indians
or
fled
naked
through
the
wintry
woods
by
the
light
of
their
blazing
houses
leaving
their
goods
and
cattle
a
spoil
to
the
assailants
several
settlements
had
been
destroyed
and
many
more
had
been
abandoned
but
the
oldest
and
wealthiest
remained
untouched
the
indians
on
the
other
hand
had
neither
provisions
nor
ammunition
while
attempting
to
plant
corn
and
catch
fish
at
montague
falls
on
the
connecticut
river
they
were
attacked
with
great
slaughter
by
the
garrison
of
the
lower
towns
led
by
captain
turner
a
boston
baptist
and
at
first
refused
a
commission
on
that
account
but
as
danger
increased
pressed
to
accept
it
yet
this
enterprise
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
as
the
troops
returned
captain
turner
fell
into
an
ambush
and
was
slain
with
men
hadley
was
attacked
on
a
while
the
people
were
at

but
the
indians
were
repulsed
by
the
bravery
of
goffe
one
of
the
fugitive
regicides
long
concealed
in
that
town
seeing
this
venerable
unknown

come
to

by
which
the

were
so
terribly
harassed
just
a
year
after
the
fast
at
the
commencement
of

a

was
observed
for

returned

was
presently
killed
philip
was
watched
and
followed
by
church
who
surprised
his
camp
killed
upward
of
a
hundred
of
his
people
and
took
prisoners
his
wife
and
boy
the
disposal
of
this
child
was
a
subject
of
much
deliberation
several
of
the
elders
were
urgent
for
putting
him
to
death
it
was
finally
resolved
to
send
him
to
bermuda
to
be
sold
into
slavery
a
fate
to
which
many
other
of
the
indian
captives
were
subjected
witamo
shared
the
disasters
of
philip
most
of
her
people
were
killed
or
taken
she
herself
was
drowned
while
crossing
a
river
in
her
flight
but
her
body
was
recovered
and
the
head
cut
off
was
stuck
upon
a
pole
at
taunton
amid
the
jeers
and
scoffs
of
the
colonial
soldiers
and
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
the
indian
prisoners
philip
still
lurked
in
the
swamps
but
was
now
reduced
to
extremity
again
attacked
by
church
he
was
killed
by
one
of
his
own
people
a
deserter
to
the
colonists
his
dead
body
was
beheaded
and
quartered
the
sentence
of
the
english
law
upon
traitors
one
of
his
hands
was
given
to
the
indian
who
had
shot
him
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
a
public
thanksgiving
his
head
was
carried
in
triumph
to
plymouth
the
popular
rage
against
the
indians
was
excessive
death
or
slavery
was
the
penalty
for
all
known
or
suspected
to
have
been
concerned
in
shedding
english
blood
merely
having
been
present
at
the
swamp
fight
was
adjudged
by
the
authorities
of
rhode
island
sufficient
foundation
for
sentence
of
death
and
that
too
notwithstanding
they
had
intimated
an
opinion
that
the
origin
of
the
war
would
not
bear
examination
the
other
captives
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
colonists
were
distributed
among

treacherously
made

some
two
hundred
of

on
a
sunday
fell
upon
two
indian
prisoners
who
had
just
been
brought
in
and
murdered
them
on
the
spot
the
same
ferocious
spirit
of
revenge
which
governed
the
contemporaneous
conduct
of
berkeley
in
virginia
toward
those
concerned
in
bacon
rebellion
swayed
the
authorities
of
new
england
in
their
treatment
of
the
conquered
indians
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
contest
was
over
in
the
south
upward
of
two
thousand
indians
having
been
killed
or
taken
but
some
time
elapsed
before
a
peace
could
be
arranged
with
the
eastern
tribes
whose
haunts
it
was
not
so
easy
to
reach
in
this
short
war
of
hardly
a
year
duration
the
wampanoags
and
narragansetts
had
suffered
the
fate
of
the
pequots
the
niantics
alone
under
the
guidance
of
their
aged
sachem
ninigret
had
escaped
destruction
philip
country
was
annexed
to
plymouth
though
sixty
years
afterward
under
a
royal
order
in
council
it
was
transferred
to
rhode
island
the
narragansett
territory
remained
as
before
under
the
name
of
province
a
bone
of
contention
between
connecticut
rhode
island
the
marquis
of
hamilton
and
the
atherton
claimants
the
niantics
still
retained
their
ancient
seats
along
the
southern
shores
of
narragansett
bay
most
of
the
surviving
narragansetts
the
nipmucks
and
the
river
indians
abandoned
their
country
and
migrated
to
the
north
and
west
such
as
remained
along
with
the
mohegans
and
other
subject
tribes
became
more
than
ever
abject
and
subservient
the
work
of
conversion
was
now
again
renewed
and
after
such
overwhelming
proofs
of
christian
superiority
with
somewhat
greater
success
a
second
edition
of
the
indian
old
testament
which
seems
to
have
been
more
in
demand
than
the
new
was
presently
published
revised
by
eliot
with
the
assistance
of
john
cotton
son
of
the
great
cotton
and
minister
of
plymouth
but
not
an
individual
exists
in
our
day
by
whom
it
can
be
understood
the
fragments
of
the
subject
tribes
broken
in
spirit
lost
the
savage
freedom
and
rude
virtues
of
their
fathers
without
acquiring
the
laborious
industry
of
the
whites
lands
were
assigned
them
in
various
places
which
they
were
prohibited
by
law
from
alienating
but
this
very
provision
though
humanely
intended
operated
to
perpetuate
their
indolence
and
incapacity
some
sought
a
more
congenial
occupation
in
the
whale
fishery
which
presently
began
to
be
carried
on
from
the
islands
of
nantucket
and
martha
vineyard
many
perished
by
enlisting
in
the
military
expeditions
undertaken
in
future
years
against
acadia
and
the
west
indies
the
indians
intermarried
with
the
blacks
and
thus
confirmed
their
degradation
by
associating
themselves
with
another
oppressed
and
unfortunate
race
gradually
they
dwindled
away
a
few
hundred
sailors
and
petty
farmers
of
mixed
blood
as
much
african
as
indian
are
now
the
sole
surviving
representatives
of
the
aboriginal
possessors
of
southern
new
england
on
the
side
of
the
colonists
the
contest
had
also
been
very
disastrous
twelve
or
thirteen
towns
had
been
entirely
ruined
and
many
others
partially
destroyed
six
hundred
houses
had
been
burned
near
a
tenth
part
of
all
in
new
england
twelve
captains
and
more
than
six
hundred
men
in
the
prime
of
life
had
fallen
in
battle
there
was
hardly
a
family
not
in
mourning
the
pecuniary
losses
and
expenses
of
the
war
were
estimated
at
near
a
million
of
dollars
growth
of
prussia
under
the
greatelector
his
victory
at
fehrbellin
thomas
carlyle
it
was
the
of
frederick
william
elector
of
brandenburg
who
is
known
in
history
as
the
great
elector
to
lay
a
firm
foundation
for
prussian
monarchy
under
his
father
george
william
the
tenth
elector
brandenburg
had
lost
much
of
its
former
importance
when
frederick
william
came
into
his
inheritance
in
he
found
a
weak
and
disunited
state
little
more
than
a
group
of
provinces
with
foreign
territories
lying
between
them
and
governed
by
differing
laws
the
great
problem
before
the
elector
was
how
to
become
actual
ruler
of
his
possessions
and
his
first
aim
was
to
weld
them
together
that
he
might
make
himself
absolute
monarch
by
forming
an
army
of
mercenaries
he
established
his
authority
his
whole
life
was
occupied
with
warlike
affairs
he
remained
neutral
during
the
last
stages
of
the
thirty
war
but
was
always
prepared
for
action
he
freed
prussia
from
polish
control
and
drove
the
swedes
from
brandenburg
this
last
was
his
most
famous
success
it
was
won
by
his
victory
over
the
swedes
under
wrangel
at
fehrbellin
carlyle
characteristic
narrative
and
commentary
on
this
and
other
triumphs
of
the
great
elector
place
him
before
the
reader
as
one
of
the
chief
personages
of
the
hohenzollern
race
and
a
leading
actor
in
european
history
brandenburg
had
sunk
very
low
under
the
tenth
elector
in
the
unutterable
troubles
of
the
times
but
it
was
gloriously
raised
up
again
by
his
son
friedrich
wilhelm
who
succeeded
in
this
is
he
whom
they
call
the
great
elector
of
whom
there
is
much
writing
and
celebrating
in
prussian
books
as
for
the
epithet
it
is
not
uncommon
among
petty
german
populations
and
many
times
does
not
mean
too
much
thus
max
of
bavaria
with
his
jesuit
lambkins
and
hyacinths
is
by
bavarians
called
maximilian
the
great
friedrich
wilhelm
both
by
his
intrinsic
qualities
and
the
success
he
met
with
deserves
it
better
than
most
his
success
if
we
look
where
he
started
and
where
he
ended
was
beyond
that
of
any
other
man
in
his
day
he
found
brandenburg
annihilated
and
he
left
brandenburg
sound
and
flourishing
a
great
country
or
already
on
the
way
toward
greatness
undoubtedly
a
most
rapid
active
man
there
was
a
stroke
in
him
swift
as
lightning
well
aimed
mostly
and
of
a
respectable
weight
withal
which
shattered
asunder
a
whole
world
of
impediments
for
him
by
assiduous
repetition
of
it
for
fifty
years
there
hardly
ever
came
to
sovereign
power
a
young
man
of
twenty
under
more
distressing
circumstances
political
significance
brandenburg
had
none
a
mere
protestant
appendage
dragged
about
by
a
papist
kaiser
his
father
prime
minister
was
in
the
interest
of
his
enemies
not
brandenburg
servant
but
austria
the
very
commandants
of
his
fortresses
commandant
of
spandau
more
especially
refused
to
obey
friedrich
wilhelm
on
his
accession
were
bound
to
obey
the
kaiser
in
the
first
place
he
had
to
proceed
softly
as
well
as
swiftly
with
the
most
delicate
hand
to
get
him
of
spandau
by
the
collar
and
put
him
under
lock
and
key
as
a
warning
to
others
for
twenty
years
past
brandenburg
had
been
scoured
by
hostile
armies
which
especially
the
kaiser
part
of
which
committed
outrages
new
in
human
history
in
a
year
or
two
hence
brandenburg
became
again
the
theatre
of
business
austrian
gallas
advancing
thither
again
with
intent
to
shut
up
tortenson
and
his
swedes
in
jutland
where
they
had
been
chastising
old
christian
iv
now
meddlesome
again
for
the
last
time
and
never
a
good
neighbor
to
sweden
gallas
could
by
no
means
do
what
he
intended
on
the
contrary
he
had
to
run
from
tortenson
what
feet
could
do
was
hunted
he
and
his
beautiful
inventors
of
the
marauding
art
till
they
pretty
much
all
died
says
kohler
no
great
loss
to
society
the
death
of
these
artists
but
we
can
fancy
what
their
life
and
especially
what
the
process
of
their
dying
may
have
cost
poor
brandenburg
again
friedrich
wilhelm
aim
in
this
as
in
other
emergencies
was
to
himself
but
for
most
part
dim
to
everybody
else
he
had
to
walk
very
warily
sweden
on
one
hand
of
him
suspicious
kaiser
on
the
other
he
had
to
wear
semblances
to
be
ready
with
evasive
words
and
advance
noiselessly
by
many
circuits
more
delicate
operation
could
not
be
imagined
but
advance
he
did
advance
and
arrive
with
extraordinary
talent
diligence
and
felicity
the
young
man
wound
himself
out
of
this
first
fatal
position
got
those
foreign
armies
pushed
out
of
his
country
and
kept
them
out
his
first
concern
had
been
to
find
some
vestige
of
revenue
to
put
that
upon
a
clear
footing
and
by
loans
or
otherwise
to
scrape
a
little
ready
money
together
on
the
strength
of
which
a
small
body
of
soldiers
could
be
collected
about
him
and
drilled
into
real
ability
to
fight
and
obey
this
as
a
basis
on
this
followed
all
manner
of
things
freedom
from
invasions
as
the
first
thing
he
was
himself
as
appeared
by
and
by
a
fighter
of
the
first
quality
when
it
came
to
that
but
never
was
willing
to
fight
if
he
could
help
it
preferred
rather
to
shift
manoeuvre
and
negotiate
which
he
did
in
a
most
vigilant
adroit
and
masterly
manner
but
by
degrees
he
had
grown
to
have
and
could
maintain
it
an
army
of
thousand
men
among
the
best
troops
then
in
being
with
or
without
his
will
he
was
in
all
the
great
wars
of
his
time
the
time
of
louis
xiv
who
kindled
europe
four
times
over
thrice
in
our
kurfuerst
day
the
kurfuerst
dominions
a
long
straggling
country
reaching
from
memel
to
wesel
could
hardly
keep
out
of
the
way
of
any
war
that
might
rise
he
made
himself
available
never
against
the
good
cause
of
protestantism
and
german
freedom
yet
always
in
the
place
and
way
where
his
own
best
advantage
was
to
be
had
louis
xiv
had
often
much
need
of
him
still
oftener
and
more
pressingly
had
kaiser
leopold
the
little
gentleman
in
scarlet
stockings
with
a
red
feather
in
his
hat
whom
savage
used
to
see
majestically
walking
about
with
austrian
lip
that
said
nothing
at
all
his
thousand
excellent
thrown
in
at
the
right
time
were
often
a
thing
that
could
turn
the
balance
in
great
questions
they
required
to
be
allowed
for
at
a
high
rate
which
he
well
knew
how
to
adjust
himself
for
exacting
and
securing
always
when
the
peace
of
westphalia
concluded
that
conflagration
and
swept
the
ashes
of
it
into
order
again
friedrich
wilhelm
right
to
pommern
was
admitted
by
everybody
and
well
insisted
on
by
himself
but
right
had
to
yield
to
reason
of
state
and
he
could
not
get
it
the
swedes
insisted
on
their
expenses
the
swedes
held
pommern
had
all
along
held
it
in
pawn
they
said
for
their
expenses
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
the
swedes
the
better
half
of
pommern
so
they
call
it
swedish
pomernia
thenceforth
which
lies
next
the
sea
this
with
some
towns
and
cuttings
over
and
above
was
sweden
share
friedrich
wilhelm
had
to
put
up
with
docked
furthermore
of
the
town
of
stettin
and
of
other
valuable
cuttings
in
favor
of
sweden
much
to
friedrich
wilhelm
grief
and
just
anger
could
he
have
helped
it
they
gave
him
three
secularized
bishoprics
magdeburg
halberstadt
minden
with
other
small
remnants
for
compensation
and
he
had
to
be
content
with
these
for
the
present
but
he
never
gave
up
the
idea
of
pommern
much
of
the
effort
of
his
life
was
spent
upon
recovering
thrice
eager
upon
that
whenever
lawful
opportunity
offered
to
no
purpose
then
he
never
could
recover
swedish
pommern
only
his
late
descendants
and
that
by
slowish
degrees
could
recover
it
all
readers
remember
that
burgermeister
of
stettin
with
the
helmet
and
sword
flung
into
the
grave
and
picked
out
again
and
can
judge
whether
brandenburg
got
its
good
luck
quite
by
lying
in
bed
once
and
once
only
he
had
a
voluntary
purpose
toward
war
and
it
remained
a
purpose
only
soon
after
the
peace
of
westphalia
old
the
same
who
got
the
slap
on
the
face
went
into
tyrannous
proceedings
against
the
protestant
part
of
his
subjects
in
who
called
to
friedrich
wilhelm
for
help
friedrich
wilhelm
a
zealous
protestant
made
remonstrances
retaliations
ere
long
the
thought
struck
him
suppose
backed
by
the
dutch
we
threw
out
this
fantastic
old
gentleman
his
papistries
and
pretended
claims
and
self
clear
out
of
it
this
was
friedrich
wilhelm
thought
and
he
suddenly
marched
troops
into
the
territory
with
that
view
but
europe
was
in
alarm
the
dutch
grew
faint
friedrich
wilhelm
saw
it
would
not
do
he
had
a
conference
with
old
young
gentleman
we
remember
how
your
grandfather
made
free
with
us
and
our
august
countenance
nevertheless
we
in
fine
the
statistics
of
treaties
was
increased
by
one
and
there
the
matter
rested
till
calmer
times
in
an
effective
partition
of
these
litigated
territories
was
accomplished
prussia
to
have
the
duchy
of
the
counties
of
mark
and
ravensberg
with
other
patches
and
pertinents
neuburg
what
was
the
better
share
to
have
juelich
duchy
and
berg
duchy
furthermore
if
either
of
the
lines
failed
in
no
sort
was
a
collateral
to
be
admitted
but
brandenburg
was
to
inherit
neuburg
or
neuburg
brandenburg
as
the
case
might
be
a
clear
bargain
this
at
last
and
in
the
times
that
had
come
it
proved
executable
so
far
but
if
the
reader
fancies
the
lawsuit
was
at
last
out
in
this
way
he
will
be
a
simple
reader
in
the
days
of
our
little
fritz
the
line
of
was
evidently
ending
but
that
brandenburg
and
not
a
collateral
should
succeed
it
there
lay
the
quarrel
open
still
as
if
it
had
never
been
shut
and
we
shall
hear
enough
about

way
it

sweden
and

parties
made
their
peace
of
oliva
abbey
of

near
dantzig
may
and
this
of
preussen
was
ratified
in
all
form
among
other
points
no
homage
more
nothing
now
above
ducal
prussia
but
the
heavens
and
great
times
coming
for
it
this
was
one
of
the
successfulest
strokes
of
business
ever
done
by
friedrich
wilhelm
who
had
been
forced
by
sheer
compulsion
to
embark
in
that
big
game
royal
prussia
the
western
prussia
this
too
as
all
newspapers
know
has
in
our
times
gone
the
same
road
as
the
other
which
probably
after
all
it
may
have
had
in
nature
some
tendency
to
do
cut
away
for
reasons
by
the
polish
sword
in
that
battle
of
tannenberg
long
since
and
then
also
for
reasons
cut
back
again
that
is
the
fact
not
unexampled
in
human
history
old
johann
casimir
not
long
after
that
peace
of
oliva
getting
tired
of
his
unruly
polish
chivalry
and
their
ways
abdicated
retired
to
paris
and
lived
much
with
ninon
de
and
her
circle
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
used
to
complain
of
his
polish
chivalry
that
there
was
no
solidity
in
them
nothing
but
outside
glitter
with
tumult
and
anarchic
noise
fatal
want
of
one
essential
talent
the
talent
of
obeying
and
has
been
heard
to
prophesy
that
a
glorious
republic
persisting
in
such
courses
would
arrive
at
results
which
would
surprise
it
onward
from
this
time
friedrich
wilhelm
figures
in
the
world
public
men
watching
his
procedure
kings
anxious
to
secure
him
dutch
printsellers
sticking
up
his
portraits
for
a
public
fighting
hero
had
the
public
known
it
was
not
his
essential
character
though
he
had
to
fight
a
great
deal
he
was
essentially
an
industrial
man
great
in
organizing
regulating
in
constraining
chaotic
heaps
to
become
cosmic
for
him
he
drains
bogs
settles
colonies
in
the
waste
places
of
his
dominions
cuts
canals
unweariedly
encourages
trade
and
work
the
canal
which
still
carries
tonnage
from
the
oder
to
the
spree
is
a
monument
of
his
zeal
in
this
way
creditable
with
the
means
he
had
to
the
poor
french
protestants
in
the
affair
he
was
like
an
empress
benefit
of
heaven
one
helper
appointed
to
whom
the
help
itself
was
profitable
he
munificently
welcomed
them
to
brandenburg
showed
really
a
noble
piety
and
human
as
well
as
judgment
nor
did
brandenburg
and
he
want
their
reward
some
twenty
thousand
nimble
french
souls
evidently
of
the
best
french
quality
found
a
home
there
made
waste
sands
about
berlin
into
gardens
and
in
the
spiritual
brandenburg
too
did
something
of
horticulture
which
is
still
noticeable
certainly
this
elector
was
one
of
the
shiftiest
of
men
not
an
unjust
man
either
a
pious
man
rather
stanch
to
his
protestantism
and
his
bible
not
unjust
by
any
means
nor
on
the
other
hand
by
any
means
in
his
interpretings
of
justice
fairplay
to
myself
always
or
occasionally
even
the
height
of
fairplay
on
the
whole
by
constant
energy
vigilance
adroit
activity
by
an
insight
and
audacity
to
seize
the
passing
fact
by
its
right
handle
he
fought
his
way
well
in
the
world
left
brandenburg
a
flourishing
and
greatly
increased
country
and
his
own
name
famous
enough
a
thickset
stalwart
figure
with
brisk
eyes
and
high
strong
nose
good
bronze
statue
of
him
by
schlueter
once
a
famed
man
still
rides
on
the
long
bridge
at
berlin
and
his
portrait
in
huge
frizzled
wig
is
frequently
met
with
in
german
galleries
collectors
of
dutch
prints
too
know
him
here
a
gallant
little
gentleman
brisk
in
the
smiles
of
youth
with
plumes
with
truncheon
caprioling
on
his
view
of
tents
in
the
distance
there
a
sedate
ponderous
wrinkly
old
man
eyes
slightly
puckered
eyes
than
mouth
a
face
well
plowed
by
time
and
not
found
unfruitful
one
of
the
largest
most
laborious
potent
faces
in
an
ocean
of
circumambient
periwig
to
be
met
with
in
that
century
there
are
many
histories
about
him
too
but
they
are
not
comfortable
to
read
he
also
has
wanted
a
sacred
poet
and
found
only
a
bewildering
dryasdust
his
two
grand
feats
that
dwell
in
the
prussian
memory
are
perhaps
none
of
his
greatest
but
were
of
a
kind
to
strike
the
imagination
they
both
relate
to
what
was
the
central
problem
of
his
life
the
recovery
of
pommern
from
the
swedes
exploit
first
is
the
famed
battle
of
fehrbellin
ferry
of
belleen
fought
on
june
fehrbellin
is
an
inconsiderable
town
still
standing
in
those
peaty
regions
some
miles
northwest
of
berlin
and
had
for
ages
plied
its
poor
ferry
over
the
brown
sluggish
stream
called
rhin
or
rhein
in
those
parts
without
the
least
notice
from
mankind
till
this
fell
out
it
is
a
place
of
pilgrimage
to
patriotic
prussians
ever
since
friedrich
wilhelm
exploit
there
the
matter
went
thus
friedrich
wilhelm
was
fighting
far
south
in
alsace
on
kaiser
side
in
the
louis
xiv
war
that
second
one
which
ended
in
the
treaty
of
nimwegen
doing
his
best
there
when
the
swedes
egged
on
by
louis
xiv
made
war
upon
him
crossed
the
pomeranian
marshes
troop
after
troop
and
invaded
his
brandenburg
territory
with
a
force
which
at
length
amounted
to
sixteen
thousand
men
no
help
for
the
moment
friedrich
wilhelm
could
not
be
spared
from
his
post
the
swedes
who
had
at
first
professed
well
gradually
went
into
plunder
roving
harrying
at
their
own
will
and
a
melancholy
time
they
made
of
it
for
friedrich
wilhelm
and
his
people
lucky
if
temporary
harm
were
all
the
ill
they
were
likely
to
do
lucky
if
he
stood
steady
however
in
his
solid
manner
finishing
the
thing
in
hand
first
since
that
was
feasible
he
then
even
retired
into
to
rest
his
men
and
seemed
to
have
left
the
swedish
sixteen
thousand
autocrats
of
the
situation
who
accordingly
went
storming
about
at
a
great
rate
not
so
however
very
far
indeed
from
so
having
rested
his
men
for
certain
months
friedrich
wilhelm
silently
in
the
first
days
of
june
gets
them
under
march
again
marches
his
cavalry
and
he
as
first
instalment
with
best
speed
from
schweinfurt
which
is
on
the
river
mayn
to
magdeburg
a
distance
of
two
hundred
miles
at
magdeburg
where
he
rests
three
days
waiting
for
the
first
handful
of
foot
and
a
or
two
he
learns
that
the
swedes
are
in
three
parties
wide
asunder
the
middle
party
of
them
within
forty
miles
of
him
probably
stronger
even
this
middle
one
than
his
small
body
of
six
thousand
horse
twelve
hundred
foot
and
three
guns
stronger
but
capable
perhaps
of
being
surprised
of
being
cut
in
pieces
before
the
others
can
come
up
rathenau
is
the
nearest
skirt
of
this
middle
party
thither
goes
the
kurfuerst
softly
swiftly
in
the
june
night
june
gets
into
rathenau
by
brisk
stratagem
tumbles
out
the
swedish
horse
regiment
there
drives
it
back
toward
fehrbellin
he
himself
follows
hard
swift
riding
enough
in
the
summer
night
through
those
damp
havel
lands
in
the
old
hohenzollern
fashion
and
indeed
old
freisack
castle
as
it
chances
freisack
scene
of
dietrich
von
quitzow
and
long
since
is
close
by
follows
hard
we
say
strikes
in
upon
this
midmost
party
nearly
twice
his
number
but
infantry
for
most
part
and
after
fierce
fight
done
with
good
talent
on
both
sides
cuts
it
into
utter
ruin
as
proposed
thereby
he
has
left
the
swedish
army
as
a
mere
head
and
tail
without
body
has
entirely
demolished
the
swedish
army
same
feat
intrinsically
as
that
done
by
cromwell
on
hamilton
and
the
scots
in
it
was
so
to
speak
the
last
visit
sweden
paid
to
brandenburg
or
the
last
of
any
consequence
and
ended
the
domination
of
the
swedes
in
those
quarters
a
thing
justly
to
be
forever
remembered
by
brandenburg
on
a
smallish
modern
scale
the
bannockburn
sempach
marathon
of
brandenburg
exploit
second
was
four
years
later
in
some
sort
a
corollary
to
this
and
a
winding
up
of
the
swedish
business
the
swedes
in
further
prosecution
of
their
louis
xiv
speculation
had
invaded
preussen
this
time
and
were
doing
sad
havoc
there
it
was
in
the
dead
of
winter
christmas
more
than
four
hundred
miles
off
and
the
swedes
to
say
nothing
of
their
own
havoc
were
in
a
case
to
take
koenigsberg
and
ruin
prussia
altogether
if
not
prevented
friedrich
wilhelm
starts
from
berlin
with
the
opening
year
on
his
long
march
the
first
foot
to
follow
at
their
swiftest
he
himself
his
wife
his
louisa
accompanying
as
her
wont
was
travels
toward
the
end
at
the
rate
of
sixty
miles
a
day
he
gets
in
still
in
time
finds
koenigsberg
unscathed
nay
it
is
even
said
the
swedes
are
extensively
falling
sick
having
after
a
long
famine
found
infinite
pigs
near
insterburg
in
those
remote
regions
and
indulged
in
the
fresh
pork
overmuch
i
will
not
describe
the
subsequent
manoeuvres
which
would
interest
nobody
enough
if
i
say
that
on
january
it
had
become
of
the
highest
moment
for
friedrich
wilhelm
to
get
from
carwe
village
near
elbing
on
the
shore
of
the
where
he
was
through
koenigsberg
to
gilge
on
the
where
the
swedes
are
in
a
minimum
of
time
distance
as
the
crow
flies
is
about
a
hundred
miles
road
which
skirts
the
two
wide
shallow
as
we
should
name
them
is
of
rough
quality
and
naturally
circuitous
it
is
ringing

for
days

awakening
the

gloomy
wrapped
in
its

with
its

into

with

of

shooting
across
those

little

which
we
heard
of
in
the
other
or
danish
end
of
the
baltic
twenty
years
ago
when
he
took
islands
without
ships
this
second
exploit
suggested
or
not
by
that
prior
one
of
karl
gustav
on
the

is
still
a
thing
to
be
remembered
by
hohenzollerns
and
prussians
the
swedes
were
beaten
here
on
friedrich

rapid

were
driven
into
disastrous
rapid
retreat
northward
which
they
executed
in
hunger
and
cold
fighting
continually
like

grim

friedrich
wilhelm
sticking
to
their
skirts
holding
by
their
tail
like
an
angry
with

whip
in

a
thing
which
on
the
small
scale
reminds
one
of
napoleon
experiences
not
till
huge
a
hundred
and
years
after
did
i
read
of
such
a
transaction
in
those
parts
the
swedish
invasion
of
preussen
has
gone
utterly
to
ruin
and
this
then
is
the
end
of
sweden
and
its
bad
neighborhood
on
these
shores
where
it
has
tyrannously
sat
on
our
skirts
so
long
swedish
pommern
the
elector
already
had
last
year
coming
toward
it
ever
since
the
exploit
of
fehrbellin
he
had
invaded
swedish
pommern
had
besieged
and
taken
stettin
nay
stralsund
too
where
wallenstein
had
failed
cleared
pommern
altogether
of
its
swedish
guests
who
had
tried
next
in
preussen
with
what
luck
we
see
of
swedish
pommern
the
elector
might
now
say
surely
it
is
mine
again
mine
as
it
long
was
well
won
a
second
time
since
the
first
would
not
do
but
no
louis
xiv
proved
a
gentleman
to
his
swedes
louis
now
that
the
peace
of
nimwegen
had
come
and
only
the
elector
of
brandenburg
was
still
in
harness
said
steadily
though
anxious
enough
to
keep
well
with
the
elector
they
are
my
allies
these
swedes
it
was
on
my
bidding
they
invaded
you
can
i
leave
them
in
such
a
pass
it
must
not
be
so
pommern
had
to
be
given
back
a
miss
which
was
infinitely
grievous
to
friedrich
wilhelm
the
most
victorious
elector
can
not
hit
always
were
his
right
never
so
good
another
miss
which
he
had
to
put
up
with
in
spite
of
his
rights
and
his
good
services
was
that
of
the
silesian
duchies
the
with
liegnitz
had
at

in
come
to
fruit
the
last
duke
of
liegnitz
was
dead

liegnitz
of
brieg
wohlau
are
brandenburg
if
there
were
right
done
but
kaiser
leopold
in
the
scarlet
stockings
will
not
hear
of
nonsense
answers
kaiser
leopold
a
thing
suppressed
at
once
ages
ago
by
imperial
power
flat
of
a
thing
at
this
time
and
you
i
again
bid
you
return
me
your
papers
upon
it
this
latter
act
of
duty
friedrich
wilhelm
would
not
do
but
continued
insisting
jagerndorf
at
least
o
kaiser
of
the
world
said
he
jagerndorf
there
is
no
color
for
your
keeping

to
which
the

again
answers
nonsense

falls

will
have
to
do
without

to
get
him

but
that
he
declined
for
the

his

that

with
his

even
with
this
his
first
wife
whom
he
loved
truly
and
who
truly
loved
him
there
were
scenes
the
lady
having
a
judgment
of
her
own
about
everything
that
passed
and
the
man
being
choleric
withal
sometimes
i
have
heard
he

not
the

it
seems
yet
her
judgment
was
good
and
he
liked
to
have
it
on
the
weightiest
things
though
her
powers
of
silence
might
halt
now
and
then
he
has
been
known
on
occasions
to
run
from

a

matter
was

farewell
thrice

to

in

his
second
wife
dorothea
who
planted
the
lindens
in
berlin
and
did
other
husbandries
fell
far
short
of
louisa
in
many
things
but
not
in
tendency
to
advise
to
remonstrate
and
plaintively
reflect
on
the
finished
and
unalterable
dreadfully
thrifty
lady
moreover
did
much
in
dairy
produce

of
not
to
speak
again
of
that

she
was
thought
to
have
in

an
oblique
manner
ah
i
have
not
my
louisa
now
to
whom
now
shall
i
run
for
advice
or
help
would
the
poor
kurfuerst
at
times
exclaim
he
had
some
trouble
considerable
trouble
now
and
then
with
mutinous
spirits
in
preussen
men
standing
on
antique
prussian
franchises
and
parchments
refusing
to
see
that
the
same
were
now
antiquated
incompatible
nor
to
say
impossible
as
the
new
sovereign
alleged
and
carrying
themselves
very
stiffly
at
times
but
the
hohenzollerns
had
been
used
to
such
things
a
hohenzollern
like
this
one
would
evidently
take
his
measures
soft
but
strong
and
even
stronger
to
the
needful
pitch
with
mutinous
spirits
one
buergermeister
of
koenigsberg
after
much
stroking
on
the
back
was
at
length
seized
in
open
hall
by
electoral
writ
soldiers
having
first
gently
barricaded
the
principal
streets
and
brought
cannon
to
bear
upon
them
this
buergermeister
seized
in
such
brief
way
lay
prisoner
for
life
refusing
to
ask
his
liberty
though
it
was
thought
he
might
have
had
it
on
asking
another
gentleman
a
baron
von
kalkstein
of
old
kin
of
very
high
ways
in
the
provincial
estates
staende
and
elsewhere
got
into
lofty
almost
solitary
opposition

at

into

flatly
refused
to
do
homage
at

accession

for
his
share

to

very
fiercely
in
a

manner

out

in

conclaves

poland
is
our

lord
which
it
was
not
always
and
we
can
not
be
transferred

you
except
by
our
consent
asked
and
given
which
too
had
been
a
little
neglected
on
the
former
occasion
of
transfer
so
that
the
great
elector
knew
not
what
to
do
with
kalkstein
and
at
length
as
the
case
was
pressing
had
him
kidnapped
by
his
embassador
at
warsaw
had
him
rolled
in
a
carpet
there
and
carried
swiftly
in
the
embassador
coach
in
the
form
of
luggage
over
the
frontier
into
his
native
province
there
to
be
judged
and
in
the
end
since
nothing
else
would
serve
him
to
have
the
sentence
executed
and
his
head
cut
off
for
the
case
was
pressing
these
things
especially
this
of
kalkstein
with
a
boisterous
polish
diet
and
parliamentary
eloquence
in
the
rear
of
him
gave
rise
to
criticisms
and
required

on
the
part
of
the
great

his

really
to
have
loved

honored

although
european
settlers
had
occupied
portions
of
the
present
state
of
pennsylvania
for
fifty
years
before
william
penn
arrived
in
that
territory
the
real
foundation
of
the
great
commonwealth
named
after
him
is
justly
dated
from
his
time
penn
was
an
english
friend
or
quaker
and
was
descended
from
a
long
line
of
sailors
he
was
born
in
london
in
his
father
being
admiral
sir
william
penn
of
the
english
navy
the
son
was
educated
at
oxford
university
and
became
a
preacher
of
the
society
of
friends
this
calling
brought
him
into
collision
with
the
authorities
he
was
several
times
arrested
and
for
a
while
was
imprisoned
in
the
tower
for
urging
the
cause
of
freedom
with
importunity
through
the
influence
of
his
family
and
the
growing
weight
of
his
own
character
he
escaped
the
heavier
penalties
inflicted
upon
some
of
his
coreligionists
and
by
the
shrewdness
and
tact
which
he
united
with
spiritual
fervor
he
rapidly
advanced
in
public
position
in
penn
became
part
proprietor
of
west
new
jersey
where
a
colony
of
english
friends
was
settled
five
years
later
through
his
influence
at
court
and
the
aid
of
wealthy
persons
he
was
enabled
to
purchase
a
large
tract
in
east
new
jersey
where
he
designed
to
establish
a
similar
colony
on
a
larger
plan
but
this
project
was
soon
superseded
by
a
much
greater
one
of
which
the
execution
is
here
related
the
interest
of
william
penn
having
been
engaged
for
some
time
in
the
colonization
of
an
american
province
and
the
idea
having
become
familiar
to
his
mind
of
establishing
there
a
christian
home
as
a
refuge
for
friends
and
the
scene
for
a
fair
trial
of
their
principles
he
availed
himself
of
many
favorable
circumstances
to
become
a
proprietary
himself
in
various
negotiations
concerning
new
jersey
he
had
had
a
conspicuous
share
and
the
information
which
his
inquiring
mind
gathered
from
the
adventures
in
the
new
world
gave
him
all
the
knowledge
which
was
requisite
for
his
further
proceedings
though
he
had
personal
enemies
in
high
places
and
the
project
which
he
designed
crossed
the
interests
of
the
duke
of
york
and
of
lord
baltimore
yet
his
court
influence
was
extensive
and
he
knew
how
to
use
it
footnote
afterward
james
ii
he
was
proprietor
of
new
york
and
lord
baltimore
of
maryland
the
favor
of
charles
ii
and
of
his
brother
the
duke
of
york
had
been
sought
by
penn
dying
father
for
his
son
and
freely
promised
but
william
penn
had
a
claim
more
substantial
than
a
royal
promise
of
those
days
the
crown
was
indebted
to
the
estate
of
admiral
penn
for
services
loans
and
interest
to
the
amount
of
sixteen
thousand
pounds
the
exchequer
under
the
convenient
management
of
shaftesbury
would
not
meet
the
claim
penn
who
was
engaged
in
settling
the
estate
of
his
father
petitioned
the
king
in
june
for
a
grant
of
land
in
america
as
a
payment
for
all
these
debts
the
request
was
laid
before
the
privy
council
and
then
before
the
committee
of
trade
and
plantations
penn
success
must
have
been
owing
to
great
interest
made
on
his
behalf
for
both
the
duke
of
york
by
his
attorney
and
lord
baltimore
opposed
him
as
proprietors
of
territory
bounding
on
the
tract
which
he
asked
for
and
as
having
been
already
annoyed
by
the
conflict
of
charters
granted
in
the
new
world
they
were
naturally
unfairly
biassed
the
application
made
to
the
king
succeeded
after
much
debate
the
provisions
in
the
charter
of
lord
baltimore
were
adopted
by
penn
with
slight
alterations
sir
william
jones
objected
to
one
of
the
provisions
which
allowed
a
freedom
from
taxation
and
the
bishop
of
london
as
the
ecclesiastical
supervisor
of

proposed
another
provision

the
preamble

of
the
good
purposes
of

of

the
bounds
of

are
thus
defined
all
that

though
these
boundaries
appear
to
be
given
with
definiteness
and
precision
a
controversy
notwithstanding
arose
at
once
between
penn
and
lord
baltimore
which
outlasted
the
lives
of
both
of
them
and
being
continued
by
their
representatives
was
not
in
fact
closed
until
the
revolutionary

charter
vested
the
perpetual
proprietaryship
of
this
territory
in
william

his
heirs
on

to
receive
those
who
wished
to
transport
themselves
establish
a

to
constitute
municipalities
and
to
carry
on
a

it
required
that
an
agent
of
the
proprietor
should
reside
in
or
near
london
and
provided
for
the
rights
of
the
church
of
england
the
charter
also
disclaimed
all
taxation
except
through
the
proprietor
the
governor
the
assembly
or
parliament
and
covenanted
that
if
any
question
of
arms
or
conditions
should
arise
it
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
proprietor
by
a
declaration
to
the
inhabitants
and
planters
of
pennsylvania
dated
april
the
king
confirmed
the
charter
to
ratify
it
for
all
who
might
intend
to
emigrate
under
it
and
to
require
compliance
from
all
whom
it
concerned
by
a
letter
from
penn
to
his
friend
robert
turner
written
upon
the
day
on
which
the
charter
was
signed
we
learn
that
the
proprietor
designed
to
call
his
territory
new
wales
but
the
a
welshman
opposed
it
penn
then
suggested
sylvania
as
applicable
to
the
forest
region
but
the
secretary
acting
under
instructions
prefixed
penn
to
this
title
the
modest
and
humble
quaker
offered
the
official
twenty
guineas
as
a
bribe
to
leave
off
his
name
failing
again
he
went
to
the
king
and
stated
his
objection
but
the
king
said
he
would
take
the
naming
upon
himself
and
insisted
upon
it
as
doing
honor
to
the
old
admiral
penn
now
resigned
the
charge
of
west
new
jersey
and
devoted
himself
to
the
preliminary
tasks
which
should
make
his
province
available
to
himself
and
others
he
sent
over
in
may
his
cousin
and
secretary
colonel
william
markham
then
only
years
old
to
make
such
arrangements
for
his
own
coming
as
might
be
necessary
this
gentleman
who
acted
as
deputy
carried
over
from
him
a
letter
dated
london
april
addressed
for
the
inhabitants
of
pennsylvania
to
be
read
by
my
deputy
this
was
a
courteous
announcement
of
his
proprietaryship
and
intentions
to
the
dutch
swedes
and
english
who
to
the
number
probably
of
about
three
thousand
were
then
living
within
his
patent
penn
object
being
to
obtain
adventurers
and
settlers
at
once
he
published
account
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
in
america
lately
granted
under
the
great
seal
of
england
to
william
this
was
accompanied
by
a
copy
of
the
charter
and
a
statement
of
the
terms
on
which
the
land
was
to
be
sold
with
judicious
advice
addressed
to
those
who
were
disposed
to
transport
themselves
warning
them
against
mere
fancy
dreams
or
the
desertion
of
friends
and
encouraging
them
by
all
reasonable
expectations
of
success
the
terms
of
sale
were
for
a
hundred
acres
of
land
forty
shillings
purchase
money
and
one
shilling
as
an
annual
this
latter
stipulation
made
in
perfect
fairness
not
unreasonable
in
itself
and
ratified
by
all
who
of
their
own
accord
acceded
to
it
was
as
we
shall
see
an
immediate
cause
of
disaffection
and
has
ever
since
been
the
basis
of
a
calumny
against
the
honored
and
most
estimable
founder
of
pennsylvania
under
date
of
july
penn
published
conditions
or
concessions
to
be
agreed
upon
by
william
penn
proprietary
and
governor
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
and
those
who
may
become
adventurers
and
purchasers
in
the
same
these
conditions
relate
to
dividing
planting
and
building
upon
the
land
saving
and
dealing
with
the
indians
these
documents
were
circulated
and
imparted
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
country
and
its
produce
so
that
purchasers
at
once
appeared
and
penn
went
to
bristol
to
organize
there
a
company
called
the
free
society
of
traders
in
pennsylvania
who
purchased
twenty
thousand
acres
of
land
and
prepared
to
establish
various
trades
in
the
province
yet
further
to
mature
his
plans
and
to
begin
with
a
fair
understanding
among
all
who
might
be
concerned
in
the
enterprise
penn
drew
up
and
submitted
a
sketch
of
the
frame
of
government
providing
for
alterations
with
a
preamble
for
liberty
of
conscience
on
the
basis
of
contracts
and
agreements
thus
made
and
mutually
ratified
three
passenger
ships
two
from
london
and
one
from
bristol
sailed
for
pennsylvania
in
september
one
of
them
made
an
expeditious
passage
another
was
frozen
up
in
the
delaware
and
the
third
driven
to
the
west
indies
was
long
delayed
they
took
over
some
of
the
ornamental
work
of
a
house
for
the
proprietor
the
governor
also
sent
over
three
commissioners
whose
instructions
we
learn
from
the
original
document
addressed
to
them
by
penn
dated
september
these
commissioners
were
william
crispin
john
bezar
and
nathaniel
allen
their
duty
was
that
of
settling
the
colony
penn
refers
them
to
his
cousin
markham
now
on
the
spot
he
instructs
them
to
take
good
care
of
the
people
to
guard
them
from
extortionate
prices
for
commodities
from
the
earlier
inhabitants
to
select
a
site
by
the
river
and
there
to
lay
out
a
town
to
have
his
letter
to
the
indians
read
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
to
make
them
presents
from
him
adding
be
grave
they
love
not
to
be
smiled
upon
and
to
enter
into
a
league
of
amity
with
them
penn
also
instructs
the
commissioners
to
select
a
site
for
his
own
occupancy
and
closes
with
some
good
advice
in
behalf
of
order
and
virtue
these
commissioners
probably
did
not
sail
until
the
latter
part
of
october
as
they
took
with
them
the
letter
to
the
indians
to
which
penn
refers
this
letter
bearing
the
date
october
is
a
beautiful
expression
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
proprietor
he
does
not
address
the
indians
as
heathen
but
as
his
brethren
the
children
of
the
one
father
he
announces
to
them
his
accession
as
far
as
a
royal
title
could
legitimate
it
to
a
government
in
their
country
he
distinguishes
between
himself
and
those
who
had
ill
treated
the
indians
and
pledges
his
love
and
service
about
this
time
william
penn
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
in
london
probably
by
nomination
of
his
friend
john
wallis
one
of
its
founders
and
with
the
hope
that
his
connection
with
the
new
world
would
enable
him
to
advance
its
objects
with
a
caution
which
the
experience
of
former
purchases
rendered
essential
penn
obtained
of
the
duke
of
york
a
release
of
all
his
claims
within
the
patent
his
royal
highness
executed
a
quitclaim
to
william
penn
and
his
heirs
on
august
the
duke
had
executed
in
march
a
ratification
of
his
two
former
grants
of
east
jersey
but
a
certain
fatality
seemed
to
attend
upon
these
transfers
of
ducal
possessions
after
various
conflicts
and
controversies
long
continued
we
may
add
though
by
anticipation
that
the
proprietaryship
of
both
the
jerseys
was
abandoned
and
they
were
surrendered
to
the
crown
under
queen
anne
in
april
penn
also
obtained
of
the
duke
of
york
another
tract
of
land
adjoining
his
patent
this
region
afterward
called
the
territories
and
the
three
lower
counties
now
delaware
had
been
successively
held
by
the
swedes
and
dutch
and
by
the
english
at
new
york
the
duke
confirmed
it
to
william
penn
by
two
deeds
dated
august
the
last
care
on
the
mind
of
william
penn
before
his
embarkation
was
to
prepare
proper
counsel
and
instruction
for
his
wife
and
children
this
he
did
in
the
form
of
a
letter
written
at
worminghurst
august
he
knew
not
that
he
should
ever
see
them
again
and
his
heart
poured
forth
to
them
the
most
touching
utterances
of
affection
but
it
was
not
the
heart
alone
which
indited
the
epistle
it
expressed
the
wisest
counsels
of
prudence
and
discretion
all
the
important
letters
written
by
penn
contain
a
singular
union
of
spiritual
and
worldly
wisdom
indeed
he
thought
these
two
ingredients
to
be
but
one
element
he
urged
economy
filial
love
purity
and
industry
as
well
as
piety
upon
his
children
he
favored
though
he
did
not
insist
upon
their
receiving
his
religious
views
we
may
express
a
passing
regret
that
he
who
could
give
such
advice
to
his
children
should
not
have
had
the
joy
to
leave
behind
him
anyone
who
could
meet
the
not
inordinate
wish
of
his
heart
in
the
mean
while
his
deputy
markham
acting
by
his
instructions
was
providing
him
a
new
home
by
purchasing
for
him
of
the
indians
a
piece
of
land
the
deed
of
which
is
dated
july
and
endorsed
with
a
confirmation
august
and
by
commencing
upon
it
the
erection
which
was
afterward
known
as
pennsbury
manor
all
his
arrangements
being
completed
william
penn
at
the
age
of
well
strong
and
hopeful
of
the
best
results
embarked
for
his
colony
on
board
the
ship
welcome
of
three
hundred
tons
robert
greenaway
master
on
the
last
of
august
while
in
the
downs
he
wrote
a
letter
to
friends
the
unfaithful
and
in
his
native
land
dated
august
and
probably
many
private
letters
he
had
about
one
hundred
mostly
friends
from
his
own
neighborhood
in
sussex
the
vessel
sailed
about
september
and
almost
immediately
the
that
desolating
scourge
of
the
of
those
days
appeared
among
the
passengers
and
thirty
fell
victims
to
it
the
trials
of
that
voyage
told
to
illustrate
the
christian
spirit
which
submissively
encountered
them
were
long
repeated
from
father
to
son
and
from
mother
to
daughter
in
about
six
weeks
the
ship
entered
the
delaware
river
the
old
inhabitants
along
the
shores
which
had
been
settled
by
the
whites
for
about
half
a
century
received
penn
with
equal
respect
and
joy
he
arrived
at
new
castle
on
october
the
day
was
not
commemorated
by
annual
observances
until
the
year
when
a
meeting
for
that
purpose
was
held
at
an
inn
in
laetitia
court
where
penn
had
resided
while
the
ship
and
its
company
went
up
the
river
the
proprietor
on
the
next
day
called
the
inhabitants
who
were
principally
dutch
and
swedes
to
the
where
after
addressing
them
he
assumed
and
received
the
formal
possession
of
the
country
he
renewed
the
commissions
of
the
old
magistrates
who
urged
him
to
unite
the
territories
to
his
government
after
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
authorities
at
new
york
and
long
island
with
a
passing
token
to
his
friends
in
new
jersey
penn
went
to
upland
to
hold
the
first
assembly
which
opened
on
december
nicholas
moore
an
english
lawyer
and
president
of
the
free
society
of
traders
was
made
speaker
after
three
days
peaceful
debate
the
assembly
ratified
with
modifications
the
laws
made
in
england
with
about
a
score
of
new
ones
of
a
local
moral
or
religious
character
in
which
not
only
the
drinking
of
healths
but
the
talking
of
scandal
was
forbidden
by
suggestion
of
his
friend
and
pearson
who
came
from
chester
in
england
penn
substituted
that
name
for
upland
by
an
act
of
union
passed
on
december
the
three
lower
counties
or
the
territories
were
joined
in
the
government
and
the
foreigners
were
naturalized
at
their
own
request
on
his
arrival
penn
had
sent
two
messengers
to
charles
calvert
lord
baltimore
to
propose
a
meeting
and
conference
with
him
about
their
boundaries
on
december
they
met
at
west
river
with
courtesy
and
kindness
but
after
three
days
they
concluded
to
wait
for
the
more
propitious
weather
of
the
coming
year
penn
on
his
way
back
attended
a
religious
meeting
at
a
private
house
and
afterward
an
official
meeting
at
choptank
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
chesapeake
and
reached
chester
again
by
december
where
much
business
engaged
him
about
ships
had
arrived
by
the
close
of
the
year
none
of
them
met
with
disaster
and
all
had
fair
passages
the
found
a
comparatively
easy
sustenance
provisions
were
obtained
at
a
cheap
rate
of
the
indians
and
of
the
older
settlers
but
great
hardships
were
endured
by
some
and
special
providences
are
commemorated
many
found
their
first
shelter
in
caves
scooped
out
in
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
when
these
caves
were
deserted
by
their
first
occupants
the
poor
or
the
vicious
made
them
a
refuge
and
one
of
the
earliest
signs
both
of
prosperity
and
of
corruption
in
the
colony
is
disclosed
in
the
mention
that
these
rude
coverts
of
the
first
devoted
emigrants
soon
became
and
nuisances
in
the
misuse
of
the
depraved
there
has
been
much
discussion
of
late
years
concerning
the
treaty
of
penn
with
the
indians
a
circumstance
which
has
all
the
interest
both
of
fact
and
of
poetry
was
confirmed
by
such
unbroken
testimony
of
tradition
that
history
seemed
to
have
innumerable
records
of
it
in
the
hearts
and
memories
of
each
generation
but
as
there
appears
no
document
or
parchment
of
such
as
to
satisfy
all
inquiries
historical
scepticism
has
ventured
upon
the
absurd
length
of
calling
in
question
the
fact
of
the
treaty
the
historical
society
of
pennsylvania
with
commendable
zeal
has
bestowed
much
labor
upon
the
questions
connected
with
the
treaty
and
the
results
which
have
been
attained
can
scarcely
fail
to
satisfy
a
candid
inquirer
all
claim
to
a
peculiar
distinction
for
william
penn
on
account
of
the
singularity
of
his
just
proceedings
in
this
matter
is
candidly
waived
because
the
swedes
the
dutch
and
the
english
had
previously
dealt
thus
justly
with
the
natives
it
is
in
comparison
with
pizarro
and
cortes
that
the
colonists
of
all
other
nations
in
america
appear
to
an
advantage
but
the
fame
of
william
penn
stands
and
ever
will
stand
preeminent
for
unexceptionable
justice
and
peace
in
his
relations
with
the
natives
penn
had
several
meetings
for
conference
and
treaties
with
the
indians
besides
those
which
he
held
for
the
purchase
of
lands
but
unbroken
and
reverently
cherished
tradition
beyond
all
possibility
of
contradiction
has
designated
one
great
treaty
held
under
a
large
at
shackamaxon
now
kensington
a
treaty
which
voltaire
justly
characterizes
as
never
sworn
to
and
never
broken
in
penn
to
the
free
society
of
traders
dated
august
he
refers
to
his
conferences
with
the
indians
two
deeds
conveying
land
to
him
are
on
record
both
of
which
bear
an
earlier
date
than
this
letter
namely
june
and
july
of
the
same
year
he
had
designed
to
make
a
purchase
in
may
but
having
been
called
off
to
a
conference
with
lord
baltimore
he
postponed
the
business
till
june
the
great
treaty
was
doubtless
unconnected
with
the
purchase
of
land
and
was
simply
a
treaty
of
amity
and
friendship
in
confirmation
of
one
previously
held
by
penn
direction
by
markham
on
the
same
spot
that
being
a
place
which
the
indians
were
wont
to
use
for
this
purpose
it
is
probable
that
the
treaty
was
held
on
the
last
of
november
that
the
delawares
the
mingos
and
other
susquehanna
tribes
formed
a
large
assembly
on
the
occasion
that
written
minutes
of
the
conference
were
made
and
were
in
possession
of
governor
gordon
who
states
nine
conditions
as
belonging
to
them
in
but
are
now
lost
and
that
the
substance
of
the
treaty
is
given
in
penn
to
the
free
these
results
are
satisfactory
and
are
sufficiently
corroborated
by
known
facts
and
documents
the
great
treaty
being
distinct
from
a
land
purchase
is
significantly
distinguished
in
history
and
tradition
the
inventions
of
romance
and
imagination
could
scarcely
gather
round
this
engaging
incident
attractions
surpassing
in
its
own
simple
and
impressive
interest
doubtless
clarkson
has
given
a
fair
representation
of
it
if
we
merely
disconnect
from
his
account
the
statement
that
the
indians
were
armed
and
all
that
confounds
the
treaty
of
friendship
with
the
purchase
of
lands
penn
wore
a
sash
of
silk
around
his
waist
as
the
most
simple
badge
the
pledges
there
given
were
to
hold
their
sanctity
while
the
creeks
and
rivers
run
and
while
the
sun
moon
and
stars
endure
while
the
whites
preserved
in
written
records
the
memory
of
such
covenants
the
indians
had
their
methods
for
perpetuating
in
safe
channels
their
own
relations
they
cherished
in
grateful
regard
they
repeated
to
their
children
and
to
the
whites
the
terms
of
the
great
treaty
the
delawares
called
william
penn
in
their
own
language
though
they
seem
to
have
adopted
the
name
given

he
accordingly

upon

under

walls
on
july
it
was
just
at
the
moment
that
louis

had
captured

at
which
his
army
appeared
ready
to
cross

was
in
alarm
believing
that
an
agreement
existed
between

and

but
it
was
not
so
the
turks
without
giving
france
any
previous
warning
had
of
themselves
made
their
invasion
of
hungary
louis
xiv
was
delighted
at
their
success
but
nevertheless
disposed
if
it
went
too
far
to
check
them
in
order
to
play
the
part
of
saviour
of
christendom
it
was
fortunate
for
the
emperor
leopold
that
he
had
upon
the
frontiers
of
poland
an
ally
of
indomitable
courage
in
king
john
sobieski
and
that
he
found
the
german
princes
loyal
and
prompt
on
this
occasion
contrary
to
their
custom
in
sending
him
succor
moreover
in

charles
of
lorraine
he
met
with
a
skilful
general
to
lead
his
army
consternation
and
confusion
prevailed
however
in
vienna
while
the
emperor
with
his
court
fled
to
linz
many
of
the
inhabitants
followed
him
but
the
rest
when
the
first
moments
of
terror
had
passed
prepared
for
the
defence
and
the
dilatoriness
of
the
turks
who
amused
themselves
with
pillaging
the
environs
and
neighboring
allowed
the
duke
of
lorraine
to
throw
twelve
thousand
men
as
a
garrison
into
the
city
then
as
he
was
unable
with
his
slender
force
to
bar
the
approach
of
the
turkish
army
he
kept
aloof
and
waited
for
the
king
of
poland
leopold

succor
on
all
sides
and
the
pope
made
an
appeal
to
the
piety
of
the
king
of

louis
xiv
on
the
contrary
was
intriguing
throughout
europe
in
order
that
the
christian
princes
should
not
quit
their
attitude
of
repose
and
he
only
offered
to
the
diet
of
ratisbon
the
aid
of
his
arms
on
condition
that
it
should
recognize
the
recent
usurpations
decreed
by
the
famous
chambers
of
reunion
and
that
it
should
elect
his
son
king
of
the
romans
he
reckoned
if
it
should
accept
his
offers
to
determine
the
turks
to
retreat
and
to
effect
a
peace
which
by
bringing
the
imperial
crown
into
his
house
would
have
been
the
for
austria
all
these
combinations
miscarried
through
the
devotedness
of
the
poles
footnote
the
chambers
of
reunion
were
special
courts
established
in
france
by
louis
xiv
these
courts
declared
for
the
annexation
to
france
of
various
territories
along
the
eastern
ed
when
leopold
supplicated
sobieski
to
come
to
his
aid
louis
xiv
tried
to
divert
him
from
it
he
reassured
him
upon
the
projects
of
the
turks
by
a
letter
of
the
sultan
he
made
him
see
his
real
enemies
in
austria
brandenburg
and
that
power
of
the
north
which
the
dutch
gazettes
had
begun
to
call
his
russian
majesty
he
reminded
him
in
fine
that
the
house
of
austria
saved
by
the
french
on
the
day
of
gothard
had
testified
its
gratitude
to
them
by
allowing
the
victors
to
die
of
hunger
and
by
envenoming
their
difference
with
the
porte
but
it
was
all
useless
hatred
of
the
infidels
prevailed
and
the
polish
squadrons
hurried
to
the
deliverance

count
rudiger

himself
alike
bold

defence
the

its
suburbs
spreading
over
the
country
all
round
to
the
distance
of
six
leagues
two
days
afterward
kara
mustapha
opened
the
trenches
and
his
artillery
battered
the
walls
in
order
to
make
a
breach
great
efforts
moreover
were
made
in
digging
mines
with
the
design
of
blowing
up
bastions
or
portions
of
the
wall
so
that
the
city
might
be
carried
by
assault
wherein
the
turks
hoped
to
find
an
immense
booty
but
the
besieged
made
an
obstinate
defence
and
repaired
during
the
night
the
damage
done
on
the
previous
day
during
sixty
days
forty
mines
and
ten
were
exploded
the
turks
delivered
eighteen
assaults
the
besieged
made
sorties
each
inch
of
ground
was
only
obtained
by
dint
of
a
hard
and
long
struggle
in
which
an
equal
stubbornness
both
in
attack
and
defence
was
exhibited
the
hottest
fighting
took
place
at
the
label
bastion
around
which
there
was
not
a
foot
of
ground
that
had
not
been
steeped
in
the
blood
of
friend
or
foe
however
by
degrees
the
turks
gained
a
few
paces
at
the
end
of
august
they
were
lodged
in
the
ditches
of
the
city
and
on
september
they
sprung
a
mine
under
the
bourg
bastion
of
the
city
was
shaken
thereby
and
a
breach
was
rent
in
the
bastion
wide
enough
for
an
assault
to
be
delivered
but
the
enemy
was
repulsed
next
day
the
turks
attacked
it
with
renewed
courage
but
the
valor
of
the
besieged
baffled
the
assailants
on
september
another
mine
was
sprung
under
the
same
bastion
and
the
breach
was
so
wide
that
a
battalion
might
have
entered
it
abreast
the
danger
was
extreme
for
the
garrison
was
exhausted
by
fighting
sickness
and
incessant
labor
the

arrive
at

on
the
when
the
whole
city
was
in
a
stupor
in
the
immediate
expectation
of
an
attack
a
movement
was
observed
in
the
enemy
camp
which
announced
that
succor
was
at
hand
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
christian
army
was
descried
surmounting
the
hill
of
kahlen
and
it
made
its
presence
known
by
a
salvo
of
artillery
john
sobieski
had
arrived
at
the
head
of
a
valiant
army
the
electors
of
saxony
and
of
bavaria
with
many
princes
dukes
and
margraves
of

had
brought
with
them
fresh
troops
charles

might
then
dare
to
march
against
the
moslems
although
he
had
yet
only

men
the
army
of

reached

the

where
it
effected
its
junction
with

had
arrived
there
in
passing
by
hoeflin
on
sunday
september
in
the
earliest
rays
of
a
fine
autumnal
day
the
holy
priest
marco
celebrated
mass
in
the
chapel
of
kahlenberg
and
the
king
of

served
him
during
the
sacrifice
afterward
sobieski
made
his
son
kneel
down
and
dubbed
him
a
knight
in
remembrance
of
the
great
occasion
on
which
he
was
going
to
be
present
then
turning
toward
his
officers
he
reminded
them
of
the
victory
of
choczim
adding
that
the
triumph
they
were
about
to
achieve
under
the
walls
of
vienna
would
not
only
save
a
city
but
christendom
next
morning
the
christian
army
descended
the
hill
of
kahlen
in
order
of
battle
a
salvo
of
five
gave
the
signal
for
the
fight
sobieski
commanded
the
right
wing
the
duke
of
lorraine
the
left
under
whose
orders
served
prince
eugene

then
aged
nineteen
the
elector
of

was
in
the
centre
the
village
of
naussdorf
situated
upon
the
danube
was
attacked
by
the
saxon
and
imperial
troops
which
formed
the
left
wing
and
carried
after
an
obstinate
resistance
toward
noon
the
king
of
poland
having
descended
into
the
plain
with
the
right
wing
at
the
head
of
his
polish
cavalry
attacked
the
innumerable
squadrons
of
turkish
horse
flinging
himself
upon
the
centre
with
all
the
fury
of
a
hurricane
he
spread
confusion
in
their
ranks
but
his
courage
carried
him
too
far
he
was
surrounded
and
was
on
the
point
of
being
overwhelmed
by
numbers
then
shouting
for
aid
the
german
cavalry
which
had
followed
him
charged
the
enemy
at
full
gallop
delivered
the
king
and
soon
put
the
turks
to
flight
on
all
sides
the
right
wing
had
decided
the
victory
by
seven
in
the
evening
the
deliverance
of
vienna
was
achieved
the
bodies
of
more
than
ten
thousand
infidels
strewed
the
field
of
battle
but
all
those
combats
were
mere
preludes
to
the
great
battle
which
must
decide
the
fortune
of
the
war
for
the
turkish
camp
with
its
thousands
of
tents
could
still
be
seen
spreading
around
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
its
artillery
continued
to
play
upon
the
city
the
victorious
was
holding
a
council
of
war
to
decide
whether
to
give
battle
again
on
that
same
day
or
wait
till
the
morrow
to
give
his
troops
an
interval
of
rest
when
a
messenger
came
with
the
announcement
that
the
enemy
appeared
to
be
in
full
flight
and
it
proved
to
be
the
fact
a
panic
had
seized
the
turks
who
fled
in
disorder
abandoning
their
camp
and
baggage
and
soon
even
those
who
were
attacking
the
city
were
seen
in
full
flight
with
the
rest
of
the
army
the
booty
found
in
the
turkish
camp
was
immense
three
hundred
pieces
of
heavy
artillery
five
thousand
tents
that
of

two

also
were

next

sobieski
accompanied
by
the

commanders
traversed
the

desired
to

to
appropriate
it
to
himself

found
in
the
west
an
empire

he
would

subject

the
sultan
himself
and
as
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
all
the
disciplined
troops
of
the
empire
he
looked
upon
his
master
as
a
shadow
denuded
of
strength
and
substance
who
being
very
inferior
in
courage
to
him
could
never
oppose
to
him
an
army
like
that
which
was
under
his
command
for
all
that
concerned
the
emperor
of
germany
he
appeared
still
less
to
be
feared
being
a
prince
bare
and
despoiled
so
soon
as
he
should
have
lost
vienna
it
was
thus
that
kara
mustapha
reasoned
within
himself
already
he
casts
his
eyes
over
the
treasures
which
he
has
in
his
possession
with
the
money
of
the
sultan
he
has
also
brought
his
own
all
that
of
the
german
princes
is
going
to
be
his
for
he
believes
that
it
is
amassed
in
the
city
he
is
besieging
if
he
needs
support
he
reckons
upon
the
different
governors
of
hungary
as
devoted
to
his
interests
these
are
his
creatures
whom
he
has
put
into
their
posts
during
the
seven
years
of
his
vizierate
not
one
of
those
functionaries
dare
offer
an
obstacle
to
the
elevation
of
his
benefactor
ibrahim
pacha
beylerbey
of
buda
keeps
him
in
suspense
by
reason
of
the
influence
that
his
fame
gives
him
over
the
army
and
over
hungary
he
must
be
won
over
before
all
else
as
well
as
the
chief
officers
of
the
janizaries
and
the
spahis
ibrahim
shall
be
made
king
of
hungary
the
different
provinces
comprised
in
that
kingdom
shall
be
divided
into
for
appanage
of
the
spahis
and
all
the
rest
of
the
soldiery
shall
have
establishments
in
the
towns
as
so
many
new
colonies
to
them
shall
be
assigned
the
lands
of
the
old
inhabitants
who
will
be
driven
out
or
reduced
to
slavery
he
reserves
for
himself
the
title
of
sultan
his
share
shall
be
all
germany
as
far
as
the
frontiers
of
france
with
transylvania
and
poland
which
he
intends
to
render
subject
or
at
least
make
tributary
the
year
following
such
are
the
projects
that
cantemir
attributes
to
kara
mustapha
the
intervention
of
sobieski
caused
these
chimerical
plans
quickly
to
vanish
the
emperor
leopold
who
returned
to
vienna
on
september
instead
of
expressing
his
thanks
and
gratitude
to
the
commanders
who
had
rescued
his
capital
received
them
with
the
haughty
and
repulsive
coldness
prescribed
by
the
etiquette
of
the
imperial
court
sobieski
nevertheless
continued
his
services
by
pursuing
the
retreating
turks
awakened
from
his
dream
of
the
grand
vizier
retook
the
road
toward
turkey
directing
his
steps
to
the
raab
where
he
rallied
the
remnants
of
his
army
thence
he
marched
toward
buda
and
attacked
by
the
way
the
styrian
town
of
lilenfeld
he
was
repulsed
by
the
prelate
matthias
kalweis
and
avenged
himself
for
that
fresh
check
by
devastating
lower
styria
he
crossed
the
danube
by
a
bridge
of
boats
at
parkany
but
the
poles
vigorously
disputed
the
passage
with
him
and
he
again
lost
more
than
eight
thousand
men
taken
or
slain
by
the
christians
shortly
after
the
fortress
of
gran
opened
its
gates
to
kara
mustapha
the
grand
vizier
barbarously
put
to
death
the
officers
who
had
signed
the
capitulation
he
threw
upon
his
generals
the
responsibility
of
his
reverses
and
thought
to
stifle
in
blood
the
murmurs
of
his
accusers
the
army
marched
in
disorder
as
though
struck
with
a
panic
terror
kara
mustapha
wished
that
a
jew
whom
he
despatched
to
belgrad
should
be
escorted
by
a
troop
of
horsemen
i
have
no
need
of
an
escort
replied
the
jew
i
have
only
to
wear
my
cap
in
the
german
fashion
and
not
a
turk
will
touch
me
the
enemies
of
the
grand
vizier
however
conspired
to
effect
his
ruin
at
constantinople
and
the
results
of
the
campaign
justified
the
predictions
of
the
party
of
peace
mahomet
iv
enraged
at
these
disasters
sent
his
grand
chamberlain
to
belgrad
with
orders
to
bring
back
the
head
of
the
vizier
it
was
in
fact
brought
to
the
sultan
in
a
silver
dish
monmouth
rebellion
gilbert
burnet
james
ii
was
scarcely
seated
on
the
english
throne
in
when
serious
disturbances
began
in
his
realm
the
king
had
inherited
the
peculiar
traits
of
the
stuarts
his
first
purpose
was
to
overcome
the
parliamentary
power
and
make
himself
absolute
ruler
he
was
likewise
a
roman
catholic
and
one
of
his
objects
was
the
suppression
of
english
protestantism
during
the
first
days
of
his
reign
the
protestant
peasants
in
the
west
of
england
rose
in
revolt
they
supported
the
claims
of
james
fitzroy
duke
of
monmouth
to
the
throne
monmouth
was
the
reputed
illegitimate
son
of
charles
ii
and
lucy
walters
with
other
exiled
malcontents
english
and
scotch
he
had
taken
refuge
in
holland
one
of
those
exiled
was
the
earl
of
argyle
whose
father
had
figured
prominently
on
the
side
of
the
scottish
presbyterians
against
charles
owing
to
national
jealousy
the
english
and
scotch
in
holland
could
not
act
in
unison
but
all
were
determined
to
strike
against
james
two
expeditions
were
planned
one
under
argyle
who
expected
to
find
forces
awaiting
him
in
scotland
the
other
under
monmouth
whose
adherents
were
to
join
him
in
the
west
of
england
argyle
attempt
miscarried
through
disagreement
among
the
leaders
and
the
earl
was
taken
and
beheaded
june
what
befell
the
enterprise
of
monmouth
is
told
by
bishop
burnet
a
contemporary
historian
monmouth
was
executed
july
and
in
the
trials
known
as
the
bloody
assizes
presided
over
by
the
brutal
george
jeffreys
some
three
hundred
of
the
duke
followers
were
condemned
to
death
and
more
than
a
thousand
otherwise
punished
as
soon
as
lord
argyle
sailed
for
scotland
monmouth
set
about
his
design
with
as
much
haste
as
possible
arms
were
brought
and
a
ship
was
freighted
for
bilbao
in
spain
he
pawned
all
his
jewels
but
these
could
not
raise
much
and
no
money
was
sent
to
him
out
of
england
so
he
was
hurried
into
an
invasion
the
whole
company
consisted
but
of
persons
they
were
all
faithful
to
one
another
but
some
spies
whom
shelton
the
new
envoy
set
on
work
sent
him
the
notice
of
a
suspected
ship
sailing
out
of
amsterdam
with
arms
shelton
neither
understood
the
laws
of
holland
nor
advised
with
those
who
did
otherwise
he
would
have
carried
with
him
an
order
from
the
admiralty
of
holland
that
sat
at
the
hague
to
be
made
use
of
as
the
occasion
should
require
when
he
came
to
amsterdam
and
applied
himself
to
the
magistrates
there
desiring
them
to
stop
and
search
the
ship
that
he
named
they
found
the
ship
was
already
sailed
out
of
their
port
and
their
jurisdiction
went
no
further
so
he
was
forced
to
send
to
the
admiralty
at
the
hague
but
those
on
board
hearing
what
he
was
come
for
made
all
possible
haste
and
the
wind
favoring
them
they
got
out
of
the
texel
before
the
order
desired
could
be
brought
from
the
hague
after
a
prosperous
course
the
duke
landed
at
lyme
in
dorsetshire
june
and
he
with
his
small
company
came
ashore
with
some
order
but
with
too
much
daylight
which
discovered
how
few
they
were
the
alarm
was
brought
hot
to
london
where
upon
the
general
report
and
belief
of
the
thing
an
act
of
attainder
passed
both
houses
in
one
day
some
small
opposition
being
made
by
the
earl
of
anglesey
because
the
evidence
did
not
seem
clear
enough
for
so
severe
a
sentence
which
was
grounded
on
the
notoriety
of
the
thing
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
was
set
on
his
head
and
with
that
the
session
of
parliament
ended
which
was
no
small
happiness
to
the
nation
such
a
body
of
men
being
dismissed
with
doing
so
little
hurt
the
duke
of
monmouth
manifesto
was
long
and
full
of
much
black
and
dull
malice
it
charged
the
king
with
the
burning
of
london
the
popish
plot
murder
and
the
earl
of
essex
death
and
to
crown
all
it
was
pretended
that
the
late
king
was
poisoned
by
his
orders
it
was
set
forth
that
the
king
religion
made
him
incapable
of
the
crown
that
three
subsequent
houses
of
commons
had
voted
his
exclusion
the
taking
away
of
the
old
charters
and
all
the
hard
things
done
in
the
last
reign
were
laid
to
his
charge
the
elections
of
the
present
parliament
were
also
set
forth
very
odiously
with
great
indecency
of
style
the
nation
was
also
appealed
to
when
met
in
a
free
parliament
to
judge
of
the
duke
own
pretensions
and
all
sort
of
liberty
both
in
temporals
and
spirituals
was
promised
to
persons
of
all
persuasions
footnote
he
asserted
that
his
mother
had
been
the
lawful
wife
of
his
ed
upon
the
duke
of
monmouth
landing
many
of
the
country
people
came
in
to
join
him
but
very
few
of
the
gentry
he
had
quickly
men
enough
about
him
to
use
all
his
arms
the
duke
of
albemarle
as
lord
lieutenant
of
devonshire
was
sent
down
to
raise
the
militia
and
with
them
to
make
head
against
him
but
their
appeared
very
evident
many
deserted
and
all
were
cold
in
the
service
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
the
whole
country
open
to
him
for
almost
a
fortnight
during
which
time
he
was
very
diligent
in
training
and
animating
his
men
his
own
behavior
was
so
gentle
and
obliging
that
he
was
master
of
all
their
hearts
as
much
as
was
possible
but
he
quickly
found
what
it
was
to
be
at
the
head
of
undisciplined
men
that
knew
nothing
of
war
and
that
were
not
to
be
used
with
rigor
soon
after
their
landing
lord
grey
was
sent
out
with
a
small
party
he
saw
a
few
of
the
militia
and
he
ran
for
it
but
his
men
stood
and
the
militia
ran
from
them
lord
grey
brought
a
false
alarm
that
was
soon
found
to
be
so
for
the
men
whom
their
leader
had
abandoned
came
back
in
good
order
the
duke
of
monmouth
was
struck
with
this
when
he
found
that
the
person
on
whom
he
depended
most
and
for
whom
he
designed
the
command
of
the
horse
had
already
made
himself
infamous
by
his
cowardice
he
intended
to
join
fletcher
with
him
in
that
command
but
an
unhappy
accident
made
it
not
convenient
to
keep
him
longer
about
him
he
sent
him
out
on
another
party
and
he
not
being
yet
furnished
with
a
horse
took
the
horse
of
one
who
had
brought
in
a
great
body
of
men
from
taunton
he
was
not
in
the
way
so
fletcher
not
seeing
him
to
ask
his
leave
thought
that
all
things
were
to
be
in
common
among
them
that
could
advance
the
service
after
fletcher
had
ridden
about
as
he
was
ordered
as
he
returned
the
owner
of
the
horse
he
rode
on
who
was
a
rough
and
man
reproached
him
in
very
injurious
terms
for
taking
out
his
horse
without
his
leave
fletcher
bore
this
longer
than
could
have
been
expected
from
one
of
his
impetuous
temper
but
the
other
persisted
in
giving
him
foul
language
and
offered
a
switch
or
a
cudgel
upon
which
he
discharged
his
pistol
at
him
and
shot
him
dead
he
went
and
gave
the
duke
of
monmouth
an
account
of
this
who
saw
it
was
impossible
to
keep
him
longer
about
him
without
disgusting
and
losing
the
country
people
who
were
coming
in
a
body
to
demand
justice
so
he
advised
him
to
go
aboard
the
ship
and
to
sail
on
to
spain
whither
she
was
bound
by
this
means
he
was
preserved
for
that
time
ferguson
ran
among
the
people
with
all
the
fury
of
an
enraged
man
that
affected
to
pass
for
an
enthusiast
though
all
his
performances
that
way
were
forced
and
dry
the
duke
of
monmouth
great
error
was
that
he
did
not
in
the
first
heat
venture
on
some
hardy
action
and
then
march
either
to
exeter
or
bristol
where
as
he
would
have
found
much
wealth
so
he
would
have
gained
some
reputation
by
it
but
he
lingered
in
exercising
his
men
and
stayed
too
long
in
the
neighborhood
of
lyme
by
this
means
the
king
had
time
both
to
bring
troops
out
of
scotland
after
argyle
was
taken
and
to
send
to
holland
for
the
english
and
scotch
regiments
that
were
in
the
service
of
the
states
which
the
prince
sent
over
very
readily
and
offered
his
own
person
and
a
greater
force
if
it
were
necessary
the
king
received
this
with
great
expressions
of
acknowledgment
and
kindness
it
was
very
visible
that
he
was
much
distracted
in
his
thoughts
and
that
what
appearance
of
courage
soever
he
might
put
on
he
was
inwardly
full
of
apprehensions
and
fears
he
dare
not
accept
of
the
offer
of
assistance
that
the
french
made
him
for
by
that
he
would
have
lost
the
hearts
of
the
english
nation
and
he
had
no
mind
to
be
so
much
obliged
to
the
prince
of
orange
or
to
let
him
into
his
counsels
or
affairs
prince
george
committed
a
great
error
in
not
asking
the
command
of
the
army
for
the
command
how
much
soever
he
might
have
been
bound
to
the
counsels
of
others
would
have
given
him
some
lustre
whereas
his
staying
at
home
in
such
times
of
danger
brought
him
under
much
neglect
the
king
could
not
choose
worse
than
he
did
when
he
gave
the
command
to
the
earl
of
feversham
who
was
a
frenchman
by
birth
and
nephew
to
de
turenne
both
his
brothers
changing
religion
though
he
continued
still
a
protestant
made
that
his
religion
was
not
much
trusted
to
he
was
an
honest
brave
and
man
but
weak
to
a
degree
not
easy
to
be
conceived
and
he
conducted
matters
so
ill
that
every
step
he
made
was
like
to
prove
fatal
to
the
king
service
he
had
no
parties
abroad
he
got
no
intelligence
and
was
almost
surprised
and
like
to
be
defeated
when
he
seemed
to
be
under
no
apprehension
but
was
abed
without
any
care
or
order
so
that
if
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
got
but
a
very
small
number
of
good
soldiers
about
him
the
king
affairs
would
have
fallen
into
great
disorder
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
almost
surprised
lord
feversham
and
all
about
him
while
they
were
abed
he
got
in
between
two
bodies
into
which
the
army
lay
divided
he
now
saw
his
error
in
lingering
so
long
he
began
to
want
bread
and
to
be
so
straitened
that
there
was
a
necessity
of
pushing
for
a
speedy
decision
he
was
so
misled
in
his
march
that
he
lost
an
hour
time
and
when
he
came
near
the
army
there
was
an
inconsiderable
ditch
in
the
passing
which
he
lost
so
much
more
time
that
the
officers
had
leisure
to
rise
and
be
dressed
now
they
had
the
alarm
and
they
put
themselves
in
order
yet
the
duke
of
monmouth
foot
stood
longer
and
fought
better
than
could
have
been
expected
especially
when
the
small
body
of
horse
they
had
ran
upon
the
first
charge
the
blame
of
which
was
cast
on
lord
grey
the
foot
being
thus
forsaken
and
galled
by
the
cannon
did
run
at
last
about
a
thousand
of
them
were
killed
on
the
spot
and
fifteen
hundred
were
taken
prisoners
their
numbers
when
fullest
were
between
five
and
six
thousand
the
duke
of
monmouth
left
the
field
too
soon
for
a
man
of
courage
who
had
such
high
pretensions
for
a
few
days
before
he
had
suffered
himself
to
be
called
king
which
did
him
no
service
even
among
those
that
followed
him
he
rode
toward
dorsetshire
and
when
his
horse
could
carry
him
no
further
he
changed
clothes
with
a
shepherd
and
went
as
far
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
being
accompanied
only
by
a
german
whom
he
had
brought
over
with
him
at
last
when
he
could
go
no
farther
they
lay
down
in
a
field
where
there
was
hay
and
straw
with
which
they
covered
themselves
so
that
they
hoped
to
lie
there
unseen
till
night
parties
went
out
on
all
hands
to
take
prisoners
the
shepherd
was
found
by
lord
lumley
in
the
duke
of
monmouth
clothes
so
this
put
them
on
his
track
and
having
some
dogs
with
them
they
followed
the
scent
and
came
to
the
place
where
the
german
was
first
discovered
and
he
immediately
pointed
to
the
place
where
the
duke
of
monmouth
lay
so
he
was
taken
in
a
very
indecent
dress
and
posture
footnote
this
engagement
took
place
at
ledgemoor
somerset
july
ed
his
body
was
quite
sunk
with
fatigue
and
his
mind
was
now
so
low
that
he
begged
his
life
in
a
manner
that
agreed
ill
with
the
courage
of
the
former
parts
of
it
he
called
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
wrote
to
the
earl
of
feversham
and
both
to
the
queen
and
the
queen
dowager
to
intercede
with
the
king
for
his
life
the
king
temper
as
well
as
his
interest
made
it
so
impossible
to
hope
for
that
that
it
showed
a
great
meanness
in
him
to
ask
it
in
such
terms
as
he
used
in
his
letters
he
was
carried
up
to
whitehall
where
the
king
examined
him
in
person
which
was
thought
very
indecent
since
he
was
resolved
not
to
pardon
him
he
made
new
and
unbecoming
submissions
and
insinuated
a
readiness
to
change
his
religion
for
he
said
the
king
knew
what
his
first
education
was
in
religion
there
were
no
discoveries
to
be
got
from
him
for
the
attempt
was
too
rash
to
be
well
concerted
or
to
be
so
deep
laid
that
many
were
involved
in
the
guilt
of
it
he
was
examined
on
monday
and
orders
were
given
for
his
execution
on
wednesday
footnote
the
duke
of
monmouth
pressed
extremely
that
the
king
would
see
him
whence
the
king
concluded
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
that
he
would
tell
to
nobody
else
but
when
he
found
it
ended
in
nothing
but
lower
submission
than
he
either
expected
or
desired
he
told
him
plainly
he
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
pardon
him
by
having
proclaimed
himself
king
thus
may
the
most
innocent
actions
of
a
man
life
be
sometimes
turned
to
his
ed
turner
and
ken
the
bishops
of
ely
and
of
bath
and
wells
were
ordered
to
wait
on
him
but
he
called
for
tennison
the
bishops
studied
to
convince
him
of
the
sin
of
rebellion
he
answered
he
was
sorry
for
the
blood
that
was
shed
in
it
but
he
did
not
seem
to
repent
of
the
design
yet
he
confessed
that
his
father
had
often
told
him
that
there
was
no
truth
in
the
reports
of
his
having
married
his
mother
this
he
set
under
his
hand
probably
for
his
children
sake
who
were
then
prisoners
in
the
tower
that
so
they
might
not
be
on
his
account
he
showed
a
great
neglect
of
his
duchess
and
her
resentments
for
his
course
of
life
with
lady
wentworth
wrought
so
much
on
her
that
she
seemed
not
to
have
any
of
that
tenderness
left
that
became
her
sex
and
his
present
circumstances
for
when
he
desired
to
speak
privately
with
her
she
would
have
witnesses
to
hear
all
that
passed
to
justify
herself
and
to
preserve
her
family
they
parted
very
coldly
he
only
recommended
to
her
the
rearing
of
their
children
in
the
protestant
religion
the
bishops
continued
still
to
press
on
him
a
deep
sense
of
the
sin
of
rebellion
at
which
he
grew
so
uneasy
that
he
desired
them
to
speak
to
him
of
other
matters
they
next
charged
him
with
the
sin
of
living
with
lady
wentworth
as
he
had
done
in
that
he
justified
himself
he
had
married
his
duchess
too
young
to
give
a
true
consent
he
said
that
lady
was
a
pious
worthy
woman
and
that
he
had
never
lived
so
well
in
all
respects
as
since
his
engagements
with
her
all
the
pains
they
took
to
convince
him
of
the
unlawfulness
of
that
course
of
life
had
no
effect
they
did
certainly
very
well
in
discharging
their
consciences
and
speaking
so
plainly
to
him
but
they
did
very
ill
to
talk
so
much
of
this
matter
and
to
make
it
so
public
as
they
did
for
divines
ought
not
to
repeat
what
they
say
to
dying
penitents
no
more
than
what
the
penitents
say
to
them
by
this
means
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
little
satisfaction
in
them
and
they
had
as
little
in
him
he
was
much
better
pleased
with
tennison
who
did
very
plainly
speak
to
him
with
relation
to
his
public
actings
and
to
his
course
of
life
but
he
did
it
in
a
softer
and
less
peremptory
manner
and
having
said
all
that
he
thought
proper
he
left
those
points
in
which
he
saw
he
could
not
convince
him
to
his
own
conscience
and
turned
to
other
things
fit
to
be
laid
before
a
dying
man
the
duke
begged
one
day
more
of
life
with
such
repeated
earnestness
that
as
the
king
was
much
blamed
for
denying
so
small
a
favor
so
it
gave
occasion
to
others
to
believe
that
he
had
some
hope
from
astrologers
that
if
he
outlived
that
day
he
might
have
a
better
fate
as
long
as
he
fancied
there
was
any
hope
he
was
too
much
unsettled
in
his
mind
to
be
capable
of
anything
but
when
he
saw
all
was
to
no
purpose
and
that
he
must
die
he
complained
a
little
that
his
death
was
hurried
on
so
fast
but
all
on
a
sudden
he
came
into
a
composure
of
mind
that
surprised
those
that
saw
it
there
was
no
affectation
in
it
his
whole
behavior
was
easy
and
calm
not
without
a
decent
cheerfulness
he
prayed
god
to
forgive
all
his
sins
unknown
as
well
as
known
he
seemed
confident
of
the
mercies
of
god
and
that
he
was
going
to
be
happy
with
him
and
he
went
to
the
place
of
execution
on
tower
hill
with
an
air
of
undisturbed
courage
that
was
grave
and
composed
he
said
little
there
only
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
blood
that
was
shed
but
he
had
ever
meant
well
to
the
nation
when
he
saw
the
axe
he
touched
it
and
said
it
was
not
sharp
enough
he
gave
the
hangman
but
half
the
reward
he
intended
and
said
if
he
cut
off
his
head
cleverly
and
not
so
butcherly
as
he
did
the
lord
russel
his
man
would
give
him
the
rest
the
executioner
was
in
great
disorder
trembling
all
over
so
he
gave
him
two
or
three
strokes
without
being
able
to
finish
the
matter
and
then
flung
the
axe
out
of
his
hand
but
the
sheriff
forced
him
to
take
it
up
and
at
three
or
four
more
strokes
he
severed
his
head
from
his
body
and
both
were
presently
buried
in
the
chapel
of
the
tower
thus
lived
and
died
this
unfortunate
young
man
he
had
several
good
qualities
in
him
and
some
that
were
as
bad
he
was
soft
and
gentle
even
to
excess
and
too
easy
to
those
who
had
credit
with
him
he
was
both
sincere
and
and
understood
war
well
but
he
was
too
much
given
to
pleasure
and
to
favorites

no

martin
the
celebrated
historian
of

for
many
years
the

had
been
acting
toward

toward

noose

is
drawn
tighter
and
tighter
till
it
strangles

the

finally
lost
patience
and
their
partial
attempts
at

disavowed
by

most
distinguished
of

been
stifled
in
blood
after
the
truce
of
ratisbon
declarations

decrees
hostile
to

succeeded

with
frightful
rapidity
nothing

was

protestant
ministers
were
prohibited
from
officiating
longer
than
three
years

request

presented
to
the

in
january
each
day
beheld
some
protestant
church
closed
for
contraventions
either
imaginary
or
fraudulently
fabricated
by
persecutors
it
was
enough
that
the
child
of
a
convert
or
a
bastard
all
bastards
were
reputed
catholic
should
enter
a
protestant
church
for
the
exercise

to
be
interdicted
there

demands
against
the
heretics
among
others
for
the
establishment
of
penalties
against
the
converts
who
did
not
fulfil
their
duties
as
catholics
the
penalty
of
death
which
had
been
decreed
against
emigrants
was
commuted
into
perpetual
confinement
in
the
galleys
by
the
request
of
the
clergy
the
first
penalty
had
been
little
more
than
a
threat
the
second
which
confounded
with
the
vilest
miscreants
unfortunates
guilty
of
having
desired
to
flee
from
persecution
was
to
be
applied
in
the
sternest
reality
it

extended
to
protestants
living

foreigners
it

july
august
a
multitude
of
protestant
churches
had
been
demolished
and
the
inhabitants
of
places
where
worship
had
been
suppressed
were
prohibited
from
going
to
churches
in
places
where
it
was
still
permitted
grave
difficulties
resulted
with
respect
to
the
principal
acts
of
civil
life
which
among
protestants
as
among
catholics
owed
their
authenticity
only
to
the
intervention
of
ministers
of
religion
a
decree
in
council
of
september
enacted
that
in
places
deprived
of
the
exercise
of
worship
a
pastor
chosen
by
the
intendant
of
the
generality
should
celebrate
in
the
presence
of
relatives
only
the
marriages
of
reformers
that
their
bans
should
be
published
to
the
congregations
and
the
registries
of
their
marriages
entered
on
the
rolls
of
the
local
court
similar
decrees
had
been
issued
concerning
baptisms
and
burials
hitherto
protestantism
had
been
struck
right
and
left
with
all
kinds
of
weapons
without
any
very
definite
method
these
decrees
seemed
to
indicate
a
definite
plan
that
is
the
suppression
of
external
worship
with
a
certain
tolerance
at
least
provisionally
for
conscience
and
a
kind
of
civil
state
separately
constituted
for
obstinate
protestants
this
plan
had
in
fact
been
debated
in
council
the
king
wrote
madame
de
maintenon
august
has
it
in
mind
to
work
for
the
conversion
of

he
has
frequent
conferences
for
this
purpose
with
le
tellier
and
de
chateauneuf
the
secretary
of
state
charged
with
the
affairs
of
the
reformed
religion
in
which
they
wish
to
persuade
me
to
take
part
de
chateauneuf
has
proposed
means
that
are
unsuitable
things
must
not
be
hastened
is
necessary

not
to
de
louvois
prefers
mild
measures
which
do
not
accord
with
his
nature
and
his
eagerness
to
see
things
ended
the
means
proposed
by
chateauneuf
was
apparently
the
immediate
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
which
was
judged
premature
as
to
the
mildness
of
louvois
it
was
soon
seen
in
operation
louvois
pretended
to
be
moderate
lest
the
king
through
scruples
of
humanity
should
hesitate
to
confer
on
him
the
management
of
the
affair
he
had
his
plan
ready
it
was
to
recur
to
the
salutary
constraint
already
tried
in
by
the
instrumentality
of
soldiers
to
the
dragonade
colbert
was
no
longer
at
hand
to
interpose
obstacles
to
this
louvois
had
persuaded
the
king
that
in
the
moral
situation
of
protestant
communities
it
would
be
enough
to
show
them
the
troops
to
compel
them
to
abjure
the
troops
had
been
shown
therefore
to
the
reformers
of
béarn
the
intendant
of
that
province
foucault
had
come
to
paris
to
concert
with
the
minister
the
management
of
the
enterprise
louvois
could
not
have
found
a
fitter
instrument
than
this
pitiless
and
indefatigable
man
who
had
the
soul
of
an
inquisitor
under
the
garb
of
a
pliant
courtier
on
his
return
from
paris
foucault
seconded
by
the
parliament
of
pau
and
the
clergy
began
by
the
demolition
on
account
of
contraventions
of
fifteen
out
of
twenty
protestant
churches
that
remained
in
béarn
and
the
conversion
of
eleven
hundred
persons
in
two
months
he
then
called
for
the
assistance
of
the
army
to
complete
the
work
promising
to
keep
a
tight
rein
over
the
soldiers
so
that
they
should
do
no
violence
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
allaying
the
scruples
of
the
king
the
troops
were
therefore
concentrated
in
the
cities
and
villages
filled
with
reformers
the
five
remaining
protestant
churches
shared
the
fate
of
the
rest
and
the
pastors
were
banished
some
to
a
distance
of
six
leagues
from
their
demolished
churches
others
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
parliament
of
pau
terror
flew
before
the
soldiers
as
soon
as
the
scarlet
uniforms
and
the
high
caps
of
the
dragoons
were
descried
corporations
whole
cities
sent
their
submission
to
the
intendant
an
almost
universal
panic
chilled
all
hearts
the
mass
of
reformers
signed
or
verbally
accepted
a
confession
of
the
catholic
faith
suffered
themselves
to
be
led
to
the
church
bowed
their
heads
to
the
benediction
of
the
bishop
or
the
missionary
and

celebrated
the
happy
reconciliation
protestants
who
had
hoped
to
find
a
refuge
in
liberty
of
conscience
without
external
worship
saw
this
hope
vanish
foucault
paid
no
attention
to
the
decrees
in
council
that
regulated
the
baptisms
marriages
and
burials
of
protestants
because
he
said
in
a
despatch
to
the
minister
in
the
present
disposition
to
general
and
speedy
conversion
this
would
expose
those
who
waver
and
harden
the
obstinate
the
council
issued
a
new
order
confirmatory
of
the
preceding
ones
and
specially
for
béarn
foucault
according
to
his
own
words
did
not
judge
proper
to
execute
it
this
insolence
went
unpunished
success
justified
everything
before
the
end
of
august
the
thousand
protestants
of
béarn
were
converted
save
a
few
hundred
foucault
in
his
in
which
he
exhibits
his
triumphs

cynicism

confesses
that

distribution
of
money
drew
many
souls
to
the
church
he
does
not
say
how
he
kept
his
promise
of
preventing
the
soldiers
from
doing
any
violence
he
does
not
recount
the
brutalities
the
devastations
the
tortures
resorted
to
against
the
refractory
the
outrages
to
women
nor
how
these
soldiers
took
turns
from
hour
to
hour
to
hinder
their
hosts
from
sleeping
during
entire
weeks
till
these
unfortunates
stupefied
delirious
signed
an
abjuration
the
king
saw
only
the
result
the
resolution
was
taken
to
send
everywhere
these
booted
missionaries
who
had
succeeded
so
well
in
béarn
louvois
sent
on
the
part
of
the
king
july
a
command
to
the
marquis
de
boufflers
their
general
to
lead
them
into
guienne
and
to
quarter
them
all
on
the
reformers
observing
to
endeavor
to
diminish
the
number
of
reformers
in
such
a
manner
that
in
each
community
the
catholics
shall
be
twice
or
three
times
more
numerous
than
they
so
that
when
in
due
time
his
majesty
shall
wish
no
longer
to
permit
the
exercise
of
this
religion
in
his
kingdom
he
may
no
longer
have
to
apprehend
that
the
small
number
that
shall
remain
can
undertake
anything
the
troops
were
to
be
withdrawn
as
fast
as
this
object
should
be
obtained
in
each
place
without
undertaking
to
convert
all
at
once
the
ministers
should
be
driven
out
of
the
country
and
by
no
means
should
they
be
retained
by
force
the
pastors
absent
the
flocks
could
more
easily
be
brought
to
reason
the
soldiers
were
to
commit
no
other
disorders
than
to
levy
daily
twenty
sous
for
each
horseman
or
dragoon
and
ten
sous
for
each
excesses
were
to
be
severely
punished
louvois
in
another
letter
warned
the
general
not
to
yield
to
all
the
suggestions
of
the
ecclesiastics
nor
even
of
the
intendants
they
did
not
calculate
on
being
able
to
proceed
so
rapidly
as
in
béarn
these
instructions
show
precisely
not
what
was
done
but
what
the
king
wished
should
be
done
the
subalterns
sure
of
immunity
in
case
of
success
acted
more
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
louvois
than
according
to
the
words
dictated
by
louis
the
king
when
by
chance
he
heard
that
his
orders
had
been
transcended
rarely
chastised
the
transgressor
lest
it
might
be
said
to
the
reformers
that
his
majesty
disapproves
of
whatsoever
has
been
done
to
convert
them
louis
xiv
therefore
can
not
repudiate
before
history
his
share
of
this
terrible
responsibility
the
result
exceeded
the
hopes
of
the
king
and
of
louvois
guienne
yielded
as
easily
as
béarn
the
church
of
montauban
the
of
the

in
this
region

majority

several
days
of

vexations

were
sixty
thousand

twenty
thousand
in

to
the

the
only
resistance
that
they
deigned
to
notice
here
and
there
was
that
of
certain
provincial
gentlemen
of
simple
and
rigid
habits

disposed
than
the

nobility
to
sacrifice
their
faith
to

dragooned

well
labored
with

marillac
successor
lamoignon
de
basville
aided
by
some
troops
that
foucault
sent
from
béarn
into
poitou
found
nothing
more
to
glean
the
king
even
caused
louvois
to
recommend
that
they
should
not
undertake
to
convert
all
the
reformers
at
once
lest
the
rich
and
powerful
families
who
had
in
their
hands
the
commerce
of
those
regions
should
avail
themselves
of
the
proximity
of

take
flight
september
basville
a
great
administrator
but
harshly
inflexible
was
sent
from
poitou
into
lower
languedoc
in
the
first
part
of
september
in
order
to
coöperate
there
with
the
duke
de
noailles
governor
of
the
province
the
intendant
of
lower
languedoc
although
he
had
zealously
coöperated
in
all
the
restrictive
measures
of
the
reformed
worship
had
asked
for
his
recall
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
that
the
king
was
determined
on
the
employment
of
military
force
convinced
that
this
determination
would
not
be
less
fatal
to
religion
than
to
the
country
he
retired
his
spirit
troubled
for
the
future
the
conversion
of
languedoc
seemed
a
great
undertaking
the
mass
of
protestants
nearly
all
concentrated
in
lower
languedoc
and
in
the
mountainous
regions
adjoining
was
estimated
at
more
than
two
hundred
forty
thousand
souls
these
people
more
ardent
more
constant
than
the
mobile
and
sceptical
gascons
did
not
seem
capable
of
so
easily
abandoning
their
belief
the
result
however
was
the
same
as
elsewhere
nîmes
and
montpellier
followed
the
example
of
montauban
the
quartering
of
a
hundred
soldiers
in
their
houses
quickly
reduced
the
notables
of
nîmes
in
this
diocese
alone
the
principal
centre
of
protestantism
sixty
thousand
souls
abjured
in
three
days
several
of
the
leading
ministers
did
the
same
from
nîmes
the
duc
de
noailles
led
the
troops
into
the
mountains
cévennes
and
gevaudan
submitted
to
invasion
like
the
rest
as
the
armed
mission
advanced
from
valley
to
valley
these
cantons
were
still
under
the
terror
of
the
sanguinary
repressions
of
and
had
been
disarmed
as
far
as
it
was
possible
as
well
as
all
lower
languedoc
noailles
in
the
earlier
part
of
october
wrote
to
louvois
that
he
would
answer
upon
his
head
that
before
the
end
of
november
the
province
would
contain
no
more
huguenots
if
we
are
to
believe
his
letters
prepared
for
the
eyes
of
the
king
everything
must
have
taken
place
with
all
possible
wisdom
and
discipline
but
the
chancellor
in
the
life
of
his
father
the
intendant
teaches
us
what
we
are
to
think
of
it
the
manner
in
which
this
miracle
was
wrought
he
says
the
singular
facts
that
were
recounted
to
us
day
by
day
would
have
sufficed
to
pierce
a
heart
less
religious
than
that
of
my
father
noailles
himself
in
a
confidential
letter
announced
to
louvois
that
he
would
ere
long
send
some
capable
men
to
answer
about
any
matters
which
he
desired
to
know
and
about
which
he
could
not
write
there
was
a
half
tacit
understanding
established
between
the
minister
the
military
chiefs
and
the
intendants
the
king
in
their
opinion
desired
the
end
without
sufficiently
desiring
the
means

limousin
la
rochelle
that
holy
zion
of
the
huguenots
all
yielded
at
the
same
time
louis
was
intoxicated
it
had
sufficed
for
him
to
say
a
word
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
to
make
those
fierce
huguenots
who
had
formerly
worn
out
so
many
armies
and
had
forced
so
many
kings
to
capitulate
before
their
rebellions
fall
at
his
feet
and
the
feet
of
the
church
who
would
henceforth
dare
to
doubt
his
divine
mission
and
his
infallible
genius
not
that
louis
nor
especially
those
that
surrounded
him
precisely
believed
that
terror
produced
the
effects
of
or
that
these
innumerable
conversions
were
sincere
but
they
saw
in
this
the
extinction
of
all
strong
conviction
among
the
heretics
the
moral
exhaustion
of
an
expiring
sect
the
children
at
least
will
be
catholics
if
the
fathers
are
hypocrites
wrote
madame
de
maintenon
at
present
it
was
necessary
to
complete
the
work
and
to
prevent
dangerous
relapses
in
these
subjugated
multitudes
it
was
necessary
to
put
to
flight
as
quickly
as
possible
the
false
pastors
who
might
again
lead
their
old
flocks
astray
and
to
make
the
law
conform
to
the
fact
by
solemnly
revoking
the
concessions
formerly
wrung
by
powerful
and
armed
heresy
from
the
feebleness
of
the
ruling
power
louis
had
long
preserved
some
scruples
about
the
violation
of
engagements
entered
into
by
his
grandfather
henry
iv
but
his
last
doubts
had
been
set
at
rest
several
months
since
by
a
special
council
of
conscience
composed
of
two
theologians
and
two
jurisconsults
who
had
decided
that
he
might
and
should
revoke
the
edict
of
nantes
the
names
of
the
men
who
took
upon
themselves
the
consequences
of
such
a
decision
have
remained
unknown
doubtless
the
confessor
la
chaise
was
one
of
the
theologians
who
was
the
other
the
archbishop
of
paris
harlai
was
not
perhaps
in
sufficient
esteem
on
account
of
his
habits
the
great
name
of
the
bishop
of
meaux
naturally
presents
itself
to
the
mind
but
neither
the
correspondence
of
bossuet
nor
the
documents
relating
to
his
life
throw
any
light
on
this
subject
and
we
know
not
whether
a
direct
and
material
responsibility
must
be
added
to
the
moral
responsibility
with
which
the
maxims
of
bossuet
and
the
spirit
of
his
works
burden
his
memory
after
the
council
of
conscience
the
council
of
the
king
was
convened
for
a
definitive
deliberation
in
the
earlier
part
of
october
some
of
the
ministers
apparently
the
two
colberts
seignelai
and
croissi
insinuated
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
be
precipitate
the
dauphin
a
young
prince
of
who
resembled
in
his
undefined
character
his
grandfather
more
than
his
father
and
who
was
destined
to
remain
always
as
it
were
lost
in
the
splendid
halo
of
louis
the
great
attempted
an
intervention
that
deserves
to
rescue
his
name
from
oblivion
he
represented
from
an
anonymous
memorial
that
had
been
addressed
to
him
the
evening
before
that
it
was
perhaps
to
be
apprehended
that
the
huguenots
might
take
up
arms
that
in
case
they
did
not
dare
to
do
this
a
great
number
would
leave
the
kingdom
which
would
injure
commerce
and
agriculture
and
thereby
even
weaken
the
state
the
king
replied
that
he
had
foreseen
all
and
provided
for
all
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
be
more
painful
to
him
than
to
shed
a
drop
of
the
blood
of
his
subjects
but
that
he
had
armies
and
good
generals
whom
he
would
employ
in
case
of
necessity
against
rebels
who
desired
their
own
destruction
as
to
the
argument
of
interest
he
judged
it
little
worthy
of
consideration
compared
with
the
advantages
of
an
undertaking
that
would
restore
to
religion
its
splendor
to
the
state
its
tranquillity
and
to
authority
all
its
rights
the
suppression
of
the
edict
of
nantes
was
resolved
upon
without
further
opposition
father
la
chaise
and
louvois
according
to
their
ecclesiastical
and
military
correspondence
had
promised
that
it
should
not
even
cost
the
drop
of
blood
of
which
the
king
spoke
the
aged
chancellor
le
tellier
already
a
prey
to
the
malady
that
was
to
bring
him
to
his
grave
drew
up
with
trembling
hand
the
fatal
declaration
which
the
king
signed
october
louis
professed
in
this
preamble
to
do
nothing
but
continue
the
pious
designs
of
his
grandfather
and
his
father
for
the
reunion
of
their
subjects
to
the
church
he
spoke
of
the
perpetual
and
irrevocable
edict
of
henry
iv
as
a
temporary
regulation
our
cares
he
said
since
the
truce
that
we
facilitated
for
this
purpose
have
had
the
effect
that
we
proposed
to
ourselves
since
the
better
and
the
greater
part
of
our
subjects
of
the
reformed
religion
have
embraced
the
catholic
and
inasmuch
as
by
reason
of
this
the
execution
of
the
edict
of
nantes
remains
useless
we
have
judged
that
we
could
not
do
better
in
order
wholly
to
efface
the
memory
of
evils
that
this
false
religion
had
caused
in
our
kingdom
than
entirely
to
revoke
the
said
edict
of
nantes
and
all
that
has
been
done
since
in
favor
of
the
said
religion
the
order
followed
to
demolish
unceasingly
all
the
churches
of
the
said
religion
situated
in
the
kingdom
it
was
forbidden
to
assemble
for
the
exercise
of
the
said
religion
in
any
place
private
house
or
tenement
under
penalty
of
confiscation
of
body
and
goods
all
ministers
of
the
said
religion
who
would
not
be
converted
were
enjoined
to
leave
the
kingdom
in
a
fortnight
and
divers
favors
were
granted
to
those
who
should
be
converted
private
schools
for
instruction
of
children
in
the
said
religion
were
interdicted
children
who
should
be
born
to
those
of
the
said
religion
should
for
the
future
be
baptized
by
the
parish
curates
under
penalty
of
a
fine
of
five
hundred
livres
and
still
more
if
there
were
occasion
to
be
paid
by
the
parents
and
the
children
should
then
be
brought
up
in
the
catholic
religion
a
delay
of
four
months
was
granted
to
fugitive
reformers
to
leave
the
kingdom
and
recover
possession
of
their
property
this
delay
passed
the
property
should
remain
confiscated
it
was
forbidden
anew
to
reformers
to
leave
the
kingdom
under
penalty
of
the
galleys
for
men
and
confiscation
of
body
and
goods
for
women
the
declarations
against
backsliders
were
confirmed
a
last
article
probably
obtained
by
the
representations
of
the
colberts
declared
that
the
reformers
till
it
should
please
god
to
enlighten
them
like
others
should
be
permitted
to
dwell
in
the
kingdom
in
strict
loyalty
to
the
king
to
continue
there
their
commerce
and
enjoy
their
goods
without
being
molested
or
hindered
under
pretext
of
the
said
religion
the
edict
of
revocation
was
sent
in
haste
to
the
governors
and
intendants
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
registered
which
took
place
in
the
parliament
of
paris
october
the
intendants
were
instructed
not
to
allow
the
ministers
who
should
abandon
the
country
to
dispose
of
their
real
estate
or
to
take
with
them
their
children
above
seven
years
of
age
a
monstrous
dismemberment
of
the
family
wrought
by
an
arbitrary
will
that
recognized
neither
natural
nor
civil
rights
the
king
recommended
a
milder
course
toward
noblemen
merchants
and
manufacturers
he
did
not
desire
that
obstinacy
should
be
shown
in
compelling
them
to
be
converted
immediately
without
exception
by
any
considerable
violence
the
tone
of
the
ministerial
instructions
changed
quickly
on
the
reception
of
despatches
announcing
the
effect
of
the
edict
in
the
provinces
this
effect
teaches
us
more
in
regard
to
the
situation
of
the
dragooned
people
than
could
the
most
sinister
narratives
the
edict
which
proscribed
the
reformed
worship
which
interdicted
the
perpetuation
of
the
protestant
religion
by
tearing
from
it
infants
at
their
birth
was
received
as
a
boon
by
protestants
who
remained
faithful
to
their
belief
they
saw
in
the
last
article
of
the
edict
the
end
of
persecution
and
proud
of
having
weathered
the
storm
they
claimed
the
tolerance
that
the
king
promised
them
and
the
removal
of
their
executioners
the
new
converts
who
persuaded
that
the
king
desired
to
force
all
his
subjects
to
profess
his
religion
had
yielded
through
surprise
fear
want
of
constancy
in
suffering
or
through
a
worthier
motive
the
desire
of
saving
their
families
from
the
license
of
the
soldiers
manifested
their
regret
and
their
remorse
and
were
no
longer
willing
to
go
to
mass
all
the
leaders
of
the
dragonades
the
noailles
the
foucaults
the
basvilles
the
marillacs
complained
bitterly
of
a
measure
that
was
useless
to
them
as
to
the
demolition
of
protestant
churches
and
the
prohibition
of
worship
and
very
injurious
as
to
the
progress
of
conversions
they
had
counted
on
rooting
out
the
worship
by
converting
all
the
believers
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
sinned
therefore
in
their
eyes
by
excess
of
moderation
louvois
hastened
to
reassure
them
in
this
respect
and
authorized
them
to
act
as
if
the
last
article
of
the
edict
did
not
exist
his
majesty
he
said
desires
that
the
extremest
rigors
of
the
law
should
be
felt
by
those
who
will
not
make
themselves
of
his
religion
and
those
who
shall
have
the
foolish
glory
of
wishing
to
remain
the
last
must
be
pushed
to
the
last
extremity
let
the
soldiers
he
said
elsewhere
be
allowed
to
live
very
licentiously
november
the
king
however
did
not
mean
it
thus
and
claimed
that
persecution
should
be
conducted
with
method
and
gravity
but
men
do
not
stop
at
pleasure
in
evil
one
abyss
draws
on
another
the
way
had
been
opened
to
brutal
and
cynical
passions
to
the
spirit
of
denunciation
to
low
and
mean
fanaticism
the
infamies
with
which
the
subaltern
agents
polluted
themselves
recoiled
upon
the
chiefs
who
did
not
repress
them
and
on
this
proud
government
that
did
not
blush
to
add
to
the
odium
of
persecution
the
shame
of
faithlessness
the
chiefs
of
the
dragonades
judged
it
necessary
to
restrain
the
bad
converts
by
making
example
of
the
obstinate
hence
arose
an
inundation
of
horrors
in
which
we
see
as
saint
simon
says
the
orthodox
imitating
against
heretics
the
acts
of
pagan
tyrants
against
confessors
and
martyrs
everything
in
fact
was
allowed
the
soldiers
but
rape
and
murder
and
even
this
restriction
was
not
always
respected
besides
many
of
the
unfortunate
died
or
were
maimed
for
life
in
consequence
of
the
treatment
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
and
the
obscene
tortures
inflicted
on
women
differed
little
from
the
last
outrage
but
in
a
perversity
more
refined
all
the
diabolic
inventions
of
the
highwaymen
of
the
middle
ages
to
extort
gold
from
their
captives
were
renewed
here
and
there
to
secure
conversions
the
feet
of
the
victims
were
scorched
they
were
strappadoed
suspended
by
the
feet
young
mothers
were
tied
to
the
bedposts
while
their
infants
at
the
breast
were
writhing
with
hunger
before
their
eyes
from
torture
to
abjuration
and
from
this
to
communion
there
was
often
not
hours
distance
and
their
executioners
were
their
guides
and
witnesses
nearly
all
the
bishops
lent
themselves
to
this
sudden
and
impious
practice
among
the
reformed
whom
nothing
could
shake
those
who
encouraged
others
to
resistance
by
the
influence
of
their
character
or
social
position
were
sent
to
the
bastille
or
other
state
prisons
some
were
entombed
in
subterranean
dungeons
in
those
dark
pits
stifling
or
deadly
cold
invented
by
feudal
barbarism
the
remains
of
animals
in
a
state
of
putrefaction
were
sometimes
thrown
in
after
them
to
redouble
the
horror
the
hospital
of
valence
and
the
tower
of
constance
at
have
preserved
in
protestant
martyrology
a
frightful
renown
the
women
usually
showing
themselves
more
steadfast
than
the
men
the
most
obstinate
were
shut
up
in
convents
infamous
acts
took
place
there
yet
they
were
rare
it
must
be
said
to
the
honor
of
the
sex
often
too
facile
to
the
suggestions
of
fanaticism
that
the
nuns
showed
much
more
humanity
and
true
religion
than
the
priests
and
monks
astonished
to
see
huguenot
women
so
different
from
the
idea
they
had
formed
of
them
they
almost
became
the
protectors
of
victims
that
had
been
given
them
to
torment
the
abduction
of
children
put
the
final
seal
to
the
persecution
the
edict
of
revocation
had
only
declared
that
children
subsequently
born
should
be
brought
up
in
the
catholic
religion
an
edict
of
january
prescribed
that
children
from
five
to
sixteen
years
of
age
should
be
taken
from
their
heretical
relatives
and
put
in
the
hands
of
catholic
relatives
or
if
they
had
none
of
catholics
designated
by
the
judges
the
crimes
that
we
have
just
indicated
might
in
strictness
be
attributed
to
the
passions
of
subaltern
agents
but
this
mighty
outrage
against
the
family
and
nature
must
be
charged
to
the
government
alone
with
the
revocation
the
dragonade
was
extended
two
places
partially
excepted
over
all
france
when
the
great
harvest
had
been
sufficiently
gathered
in
the
south
and
west
the
reapers
were
sent
elsewhere
the
battalions
of
converters
marched
from
province
to
province
till
they
reached
the
northern
frontier
carrying
everywhere
the
same
terror
metz
where
the
protestants
were
numerous
was
particularly
the
theatre
of
abominable
excesses
paris
and
alsace
were
alone
to
a
certain
extent
preserved
louvois
did
not
dare
to
show
such
spectacles
to
the
society
of
versailles
and
paris
the
king
would
not
have
endured
it
the
people
of
paris
demolished
the
protestant
church
of
charenton
an
object
of
their
ancient
animosity
the
ruling
power
weighed
heavily
upon
the
eight
or
nine
thousand
huguenots
who
remained
in
the
capital
and
constrained
of
them
by
intimidation
to
a
feigned
conversion
but
there
were
no
striking
acts
of
violence
except
perhaps
the
banishment
of
thirty
elders
of
the
consistory
to
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
the
soldiers
did
not
make
their
appearance
the
lieutenant
of
police
la
reinie
took
care
to
reassure
the
leading
merchants
and
the
last
article
of
the
edict
of
revocation
was
very
nearly
observed
in
paris
and
its
environs
as
to
lutheran
alsace
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
system
of
the
edict
of
nantes
and
the
french
calvinists
the
treaty
of
westphalia
the
capitulation
of
strasburg
all
the
acts
that
bound
it
to
france
guaranteed
to
it
a
separate
religious
state
an
attempt
was
indeed
made
to
encroach
upon
lutheranism
by
every
means
of
influence
and
by
a
system
of
petty
annoyances
but
direct
attacks
were
limited
to
a
suppression
of
public
worship
in
places
where
the
population
was
catholic
the
political
events
that
soon
disturbed
europe
compelled
the
french
government
to
be
circumspect
toward
the
people
of
this
recently
conquered
frontier
the
converters
indemnified
themselves
at
the
expense
of
another
frontier
population
that
was
not
dependent
on
france
the
vaudois
the
first
offspring
of
the
reformation
had
always
kept
possession
of
the
high
alpine
valleys
on
the
confines
of
piedmont
and
dauphiny
in
spite
of
the
persecutions
that
they
had
repeatedly
endured
from
the
governments
of
france
and
piedmont
the
piedmontese
vaudois
had
their
edict
of
nantes
that
is
liberty
of
worship
in
the
three
valleys
of
martin
la
luzerne
and
la
perouse
when
the
dragonade
invaded
dauphiny
the
vaudois
about
briançon
and
pignerol
took
refuge
in
crowds
with
their
brethren
in
the
valleys
subject
to
piedmont
the
french
government
was
unwilling
to
suffer
them
to
remain
in
this
asylum
the
duke
victor
amadeus
ii
enjoined
the
refugees
to
quit
his
territory
november
the
order
was
imperfectly
executed
and
louis
xiv
demanded
more
the
duke
by
an
edict
of
february
prohibited
the
exercise
of
heretical
worship
and
ordered
the
schools
to
be
closed
under
penalty
of
death
the
ministers
schoolmasters
and
french
refugees
were
to
leave
the
states
of
the
duke
in
a
fortnight
under
the
same
penalty
the
vaudois
responded
by
taking
up
arms
without
reflecting
on
the
immense
force
of
their
oppressors
the
three
valleys
were
assailed
at
the
same
time
by
french
and
piedmontese
troops
the
french
were
commanded
by
the
governor
of
casale
catinat
a
man
of
noble
heart
an
elevated
and
philosophic
mind
who
deplored
his
fatal
mission
and
attempted
to
negotiate
with
the
insurgents
but
catinat
could
neither
persuade
to
submission
these
men
resolved
to
perish
rather
than
renounce
their
faith
nor
restrain
the
fury
of
his
soldiers
exasperated
by
the
vigor
of
the
resistance
the
valleys
of
martin
and
la
perouse
were
captured
and
the
victors
committed
frightful
barbarities
meanwhile
the
piedmontese
after
having
induced
the
mountaineers
who
guarded
the
entrance
of
the
valley
of
la
luzerne
to
lay
down
their
arms
by
false
promises
slaughtered
three
thousand
women
children
and
old
men
at
the
pré
de
la
tour
the
remotest
recesses
of
the
alps
were
searched
a
multitude
of
unfortunates
were
exterminated
singly
more
than
ten
thousand
were
dragged
as
prisoners
to
the
fortresses
of
piedmont
where
most
of
them
died
of
want
a
handful
of
the
bravest
succeeding
in
maintaining
themselves
among
the
rocks
where
they
could
not
be
captured
and
protected
by
the
intervention
of
protestant
powers
and
especially
of
the
swiss
finally
obtained
liberty
to
emigrate
both
for
themselves
and
their
coreligionists
there
has
often
been
seen
in
history
much
greater
bloodshed
than
that
caused
by
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
scenes
of
destruction
planned
more
directly
and
on
a
vaster
scale
by
governments
and
sometimes
the
same
contrast
between
an
advanced
state
of
civilization
and
acts
of
barbarity
but
no
spectacle
wounds
moral
sense
and
humanity
to
the
same
degree
as
this
persecution
carried
on
coldly
and
according
to
abstract
ideas
without
the
excuse
of
struggle
and
danger
without
the
ardent
fever
of
battle
and
revolution
the
very
virtues
of
the
persecutors
are
here
but
an
additional
monstrosity
doubtless
there
is
also
seen
at
a
later
period
among
the
authors
of
another
reign
of
terror
this
same
contrast
that
astounds
and
troubles
the
conscience
of
posterity
but
they
at
least
staked
each
day
their
own
lives
against
the
lives
of
their
adversaries
and
with
their
lives
the
very
existence
of
the
country
involved
in
their
cause
a
million
and
a
half
of
frenchmen
were
in
terror
and
despair
yet
songs
of
victory
resounded
around
louis
the

the
aged

lifted
to
heaven
the
hand
that
had
just
signed
the
revocation
and
parodied
on
the
occasion
of
an
edict
that
recalls
the
times

some
were

up
to

punishment
many
nevertheless
continued
their
perilous
assistance
to

few
betrayed
them
those

whom
the
authority
wished
most
to
retain
in

the
interested
compassion
of

it
is
said
that
the
fugitives
carried
out
of
france
sixty
millions
in
five
years
however
this
may
be
the
loss
of
men
was
much
more
to
be
regretted
than
the
loss
of
money
the
vital
energy
of
france
did
not
cease
for
many
years
to
ooze
away
through
this
ulcer
of
emigration
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
even
approximately
the
number
of
protestants
who
abandoned
their
country
become
to
them
a
barbarous
mother
vauban
estimated
it
at
a
hundred
thousand
from
to
benoit
the
calvinist
historian
of
the
edict
of
nantes
who
published
his
book
in
estimates
it
at
two
hundred
thousand
the
illustrious
refugee
basnage
speaks
vaguely
of
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
others
give
figures
much
more
exaggerated
while
the
duke
of
burgundy
in
the
memoir
that
we
have
cited
above
reduces
the
emigration
to
less
than
thousand
souls
in
the
course
of
twenty
years
but
the
truly
inconceivable
illusions
preserved
by
this
young
prince
concerning
the
moral
and
political
results
of
the
revocation
do
not
allow
us
to
put
confidence
in
his
testimony
he
was
deceived
took
pleasure
in
being
deceived
and
closed
his
ear
to
whomsoever
desired
to
undeceive
him
the
amount
from
two
hundred
thousand
to
two
hundred
fifty
thousand
from
the
revocation
to
the
commencement
of
the
following
century
that
is
to
the
revolt
of
cévennes
seems
most
probable
but
it
is
not
so
much
by
the
quantity
as
by
the
quality
of
the
emigrants
that
the
real
loss
of
france
must
be
measured
france
was
incomparably
more
weakened
than
if
two
hundred
thousand
citizens
had
been
taken
at
hazard
from
the
catholic
mass
of
the
nation
the
protestants
were
very
superior
on
the
average
if
not
to
the
catholic
middle
class
of
paris
and
the
principal
centres
of
french
civilization
at
least
to
the
mass
of
the
people
and
the
emigrants
were
the
best
of
the
protestants
a
multitude
of
useful
men
among
them
many
superior
men
left
a
frightful
void
in
france
and
went
to
swell
the
forces
of
protestant
nations
france
declined
both
by
what
she
lost
and
what
her
rivals
gained
before
nine
thousand
sailors
the
best
in
the
kingdom
as
vauban
says
twelve
thousand
soldiers
six
hundred
officers
had
gone
to
foreign
countries
the
most
skilful
chiefs
and
agents
of
contemporaneous
industry
went
in
multitudes
to
settle
in
foreign
lands
industrial
capacities
less
striking
than
literary
capacities
inflicted
losses
on
france
still
more
felt
and
less
reparable
france
was
rich
enough
in
literary
glory
to
lose
much
without
being
impoverished
such
was
not
the
case
with
respect
to
industry
france
was
to
descend
in
a
few
years
almost
in
a
few
months
from
that
economical
supremacy
which
had
been
conquered
for
her
by
long
efforts
of
a
protective
administration
populous
cities
beheld
the
branches
of
commerce
that
constituted
their
prosperity
rapidly
sinking
by
the
disappearance
of
the
principal
industrial
families
and
these
branches
taking
root
on
the
other
side
of
the
frontiers
thus
fell
never
to
rise
again
the
norman
hat
trade
already
suffering
on
account
of
regulations
that
fettered
the
canadian
fur
trade
other
branches
in
great
number
did
not
disappear
entirely
but
witnessed
the
rise
of
a
formidable
competition
in
foreign
lands
where
they
had
hitherto
remained
unknown
these
were
so
many
outlets
closed
so
many
markets
lost
for
our
exportation
lately
so
flourishing
a
suburb
of
london
spitalfields
was
peopled
with
our
workmen
in
silk
emigrated
from
lyons
and
touraine
which
lost
of
their
looms
the
manufacture
of
french
silk
was
also
established
in
holland
with
cloth
manufacture
etc
many
branches
of
industry
were
transplanted
to
brandenburg
and
twenty
thousand
frenchmen
carried
the
most
refined
arts
of
civilization
to
the
coarse
population
thinly
scattered
among
the
sands
and
firs
of
that
sombre
region
french
refugees
paid
for
the
hospitality
of
the
elector
frederick
by
laying
the
foundation
of
the
high
destinies
of
berlin
which
on
their
arrival
was
still
but
a
small
city
of
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
souls
and
which
thenceforth
took
a
start
which
nothing
was
to
arrest
like
the
hebrews
after
the
fall
of
jerusalem
the
huguenot
exiles
scattered
themselves
over
the
entire
world
some
went
to
ireland
carrying
the
cultivation
of
flax
and
hemp
others
led
by
a
nephew
of
duquesne
founded
a
small
colony
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
france
was
impoverished
not
only
in
frenchmen
who
exiled
themselves
but
in
those
much
more
numerous
who
remained
in
spite
of
themselves
discouraged
ruined
whether
they
openly
resisted
persecution
or
suffered
some
external
observances
of
catholicism
to
be
wrung
from
them
all
having
neither
energy
in
work
nor
security
in
life
it
was
really
the
activity
of
more
than
a
million
of
men
that
france
lost
and
of
the
million
that
produced
most
the
great
enterprise
the
miracle
of
the
reign
therefore
miscarried
the
new
temple
that
louis
had
pretended
to
erect
to
unity
fell
to
ruin
as
it
rose
from
the
ground
and
left
only
an
open
chasm
in
place
of
its
foundation
everything
that
had
been
undertaken
by
the
governing
power
of
france
for
a
century
in
the
direction
of
national
civil
and
territorial
unity
had
gloriously
succeeded
as
soon
as
the
governing
power
left
this
legitimate
field
of
unity
to
invade
the
domain
of
conscience
and
of
human
individuality
it
raised
before
itself
insurmountable
obstacles
it
concerned
itself
in
contests
wherein
it
was
equally
fatal
to
conquer
or
be
conquered
and
gave
the
first
blow
to
the
greatness
of
france
what
a
contrast
between
the
pretensions
of
louis
that
he
could
neither
be
mistaken
nor
deceived
that
he
saw
everything
that
he
accomplished
everything
and
the
illusions
with
which
he
was
surrounded
in
regard
to
the
facility
of
success
and
the
means
employed
the
nothingness
of
absolute
power
and
of
government
by
one
alone
was
thus
revealed
under
the
reign

the
great
king

not
only
did
the
stuart
line
come
to
an
end
but
the
protestant
religion
was
finally
established
in
the
kingdom
by
the
declaration
of
right
upon
which
their
title
rested
it
was
decreed
that
after

death

william
of
orange
was
a
nephew
of
james
ii
he
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
as
leader
of
the
dutch
against
the
invasions
of
louis
xiv
when
the
english
people
tired
of
the
tyranny
of
james
ii
and
also
fearing
that
he
might
be
succeeded
by
a
catholic
decided
to
choose
a
protestant
for
their
sovereign
william
was
married
to
mary
eldest
child
of
james
ii
could
they
have
been
sure
that
she
would
succeed
her
father
the
english
people
would
gladly
have
had
mary
for
their
sole
ruler
though
european
interests
demanded
the
elevation
to
larger
power
of
the
prince
of
orange
as
the
great
antagonist
of
louis
xiv
william
was
accordingly
invited
to
take
possession
of
the
english
throne
conjointly
with
mary
the
prince
of

landed
at
torbay
november
this
revolution
one
of
the
least
violent
in
all
history
is
best
described
by
bishop
burnet
who
accompanied
william
of
orange
from
holland
to
england
and
in
was
made
bishop
of
salisbury
he
is
not
less
eminent
as
the
historian
of
his
time
than
as
a
theologian
and
prelate
of
the
english
church
having
made
his
preparations
for
sailing
william
was
annoyed
by
many
delays
occasioned
by
the
hesitation
of
his
subordinates

william
summoned

in

wholly
modern
way
the
particulars
of
the
formal
accession
of
william
and
mary
gilbert
burnet
all
this
while
the
were
still
riding
at
sea
it
being
a
continued
storm
for
some
weeks
the
prince
sent
out
several
with
orders
to
them
to
come
in
but
they
could
not
come
up
to
them
on
october
there
was
for
six
hours
together
a
most
dreadful
storm
so
that
there
were
few
among
us
that
did
not
conclude
that
the
best
part
of
the
fleet
and
by
consequence
that
the
whole
design
were
lost
many
that
have
passed
for
heroes
yet
showed
then
the
agonies
of
fear
in
their
looks
and
whole
deportment
the
prince
still
retained
his
usual
calmness
and
the
same
tranquillity
of
spirit
that
i
had
observed
in
him
in
his
happiest
days
on
the
it
calmed
a
little
and
our
fleet
came
all
in
to
our
great
joy
the
rudder
of
one
was
broken
and
that
was
all
the
hurt
that
the
storm
had
done
at
last
the
east
wind
came
and
so
hard
a
thing
it
was
to
set
so
vast
a
body
in
motion
that
two
days
of
this
wind
were
lost
before
all
could
be
quite
ready
footnote
william
of
orange
on
november
we
sailed
out
with
the
evening
tide
but
made
little
way
that
night
that
so
our
fleet
might
come
out
and
move
in
order
we
tried
next
day
till
noon
if
it
were
possible
to
sail
northward
but
the
wind
was
so
strong
and
full
in
the
east
that
we
could
not
move
that
way
about
noon
the
signal
was
given
to
steer
westward
this
wind
not
only
diverted
us
from
that
unhappy
course
but
it
kept
the
english
fleet
in
the
river
so
that
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
come
out
though
they
were
come
down
as
far
as
to
the
gunfleet
by
this
means
we
had
the
sea
open
to
us
with
a
fair
wind
and
a
safe
navigation
on
the
we
passed
between
dover
and
calais
and
before
night
came
in
sight
of
the
isle
of
wight
the
next
day
being
the
day
in
which
the
prince
was
both
born
and
married
he
fancied
if
he
could
land
that
day
it
would
look
auspicious
to
the
army
and
animate
the
soldiers
but
we
all
who
considered
that
the
day
following
being
day
our
landing
that
day
might
have
a
good
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
english
nation
were
better
pleased
to
see
that
we
could
land
no
sooner
torbay
was
thought
the
best
place
for
our
great
fleet
to
lie
in
and
it
was
resolved
to
land
the
army
where
it
could
be
best
done
near
it
reckoning
that
being
at
such
a
distance
from
london
we
could
provide
ourselves
with
horses
and
put
everything
in
order
before
the
king
could
march
his
army
toward
us
and
that
we
should
lie
some
time
at
exeter
for
the
refreshing
of
our
men
i
was
in
the
ship
with
the
prince
other
domestics
that
went
in
the
van
of
the
whole
fleet
at
noon
on
the
russel
came
on
board
us
with
the
best
of
all
the
english
pilots
that
they
had
brought
over
he
gave
him
the
steering
of
the
ship
and
ordered
him
to
be
sure
to
sail
so
that
next
morning
we
should
be
short
of
dartmouth
for
it
was
intended
that
some
of
the
ships
should
land
there
and
that
the
rest
should
sail
into
torbay
the
pilot
thought
he
could
not
be
mistaken
in
measuring
our
course
and
believed
that
he
certainly
kept
within
orders
till
the
morning
showed
us
we
were
past
torbay
and
dartmouth
the
wind
though
it
had
abated
much
of
its
first
violence
was
yet
still
full
in
the
east
so
now
it
seemed
necessary
for
us
to
sail
on
to
plymouth
which
must
have
engaged
us
in
a
long
and
tedious
campaign
in
winter
through
a
very
ill
country
nor
were
we
sure
to
be
received
at
plymouth
the
earl
of
bath
who
was
governor
had
sent
by
russel
a
promise
to
the
prince
to
come
and
join
him
yet
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
be
so
forward
as
to
receive
us
at
our
first
coming
the
delays
he
made
afterward
pretending
that
he
was
managing
the
garrison
whereas
he
was
indeed
staying
till
he
saw
how
the
matter
was
likely
to
be
decided
showed
us
how
fatal
it
had
proved
if
we
had
been
forced
to
sail
on
to
plymouth
but
while
russel
was
in
no
small
disorder
after
he
saw
the
pilot
error
upon
which
he
bade
me
go
to
my
prayers
for
all
was
lost
and
as
he
was
ordering
the
boat
to
be
cleared
to
go
aboard
the
prince
on
a
sudden
to
all
our
wonder
it
calmed
a
little
and
then
the
wind
turned
into
the
south
and
a
soft
and
happy
gale
of
wind
carried
in
the
whole
fleet
in
four
hours
time
into
torbay
immediately
as
many
landed
as
conveniently
could
as
soon
as
the
prince
and
marshal
schomberg
got
to
shore
they
were
furnished
with
such
horses
as
the
village
of
broxholme
could
afford
and
rode
up
to
view
the
grounds
which
they
found
as
convenient
as
could
be
imagined
for
the
foot
in
that
season
it
was
not
a
cold
night
otherwise
the
soldiers
who
had
been
kept
warm
aboard
might
have
suffered
much
by
it
as
soon
as
i
landed
i
made
what
haste
i
could
to
the
place
where
the
prince
was
who
took
me
heartily
by
the
hand
and
asked
me
if
i
would
not
now
believe
in
predestination
i
told
him
i
would
never
forget
that
providence
of
god
which
had
appeared
so
signally
on
this
occasion
he
was
cheerfuller
than
ordinary
yet
he
returned
soon
to
his
usual
gravity
the
prince
sent
for
all
the
fishermen
of
the
place
and
asked
them
which
was
the
properest
place
for
landing
his
horse
which
all
apprehended
would
be
a
tedious
business
and
might
hold
some
days
but
next
morning
he
was
showed
a
place
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
village
where
the
ships
could
be
brought
very
near
the
land
against
a
good
shore
and
the
horses
would
not
be
put
to
swim
above
twenty
yards
this
proved
to
be
so
happy
for
our
landing
though
we
came
to
it
by
mere
accident
that
if
we
had
ordered
the
whole
island
round
to
be
sounded
we
could
not
have
found
a
properer
place
for
it
there
was
a
dead
calm
all
that
morning
and
in
three
hours
time
all
our
horse
were
landed
with
as
much
baggage
as
was
necessary
till
we
got
to
exeter
the
artillery
and
heavy
baggage
were
left
aboard
and
ordered
to
topsham
the
seaport
to
exeter
all
that
belonged
to
us
was
so
soon
and
so
happily
landed
that
by
the
next
day
at
noon
we
were
in
full
march
and
marched
four
miles
that
night
we
had
from
thence
twenty
miles
to
exeter
and
we
resolved
to
make
haste
thither
footnote
light
is
thrown
on
this
passage
by
the
following
curious
account
given
in
of
carstares
set
out
along
with
his
highness
in
quality
of
his
domestic
chaplain
and
went
aboard
of
his
own
ship
it
is
well
known
that
upon
their
first
setting
out
from
the
coast
of
holland
the
fleet
was
in
imminent
danger
by
a
violent
tempest
which
obliged
them
to
put
back
for
a
few
days
upon
that
occasion
the
vessel
which
carried
the
prince
and
his
retinue
narrowly
escaped
shipwreck
a
circumstance
which
some
who
were
around
his
person
were
disposed
to
interpret
into
a
bad
omen
of
their
success
among
these
burnet
happening
to
observe
that
it
seemed
predestined
that
they
should
not
set
foot
on
english
ground
the
prince
said
nothing
but
upon
stepping
ashore
at
torbay
in
the
hearing
of
carstares
he
turned
about
to
burnet
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
doctrine
of
predestination
now
cunningham
according
to
the
translation
of
the
latin
of
his
of
says
that
burnet
who
understood
but
little
of
military
affairs
asked
the
prince
of
orange
which
way
he
intended
to
march
and
when
and
desired
to
be
employed
by
him
in
whatever
service
he
should
think
fit
the
prince
only
asked
what
he
now
thought
of
predestination
and
advised
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
busy
to
consult
the
canons
the
bishop
omits
mentioning
the
proximate
cause
of
the
question
and
says
nothing
about
his
declining
the
offer
of
his
services
which
indeed
it
is
not
likely
that
he
did
at
least
so
uncivilly
but
as
we
were
now
happily
landed
and
marching
we
saw
new
and
characters
of
a
favorable
providence
of
god
watching
over
us
we
had
no
sooner
got
thus
disengaged
from
our
fleet
than
a
new
and
great
storm
blew
from
the
west
from
which
our
fleet
being
covered
by
the
land
could
receive
no
prejudice
but
the
king
fleet
had
got
out
as
the
wind
calmed
and
in
pursuit
of
us
was
come
as
far
as
the
isle
of
wight
when
this
contrary
wind
turned
upon
them
they
tried
what
they
could
to
pursue
us
but
they
were
so
shattered
by
some
days
of
this
storm
that
they
were
forced
to
go
into
portsmouth
and
were
no
more
fit
for
service
that
year
this
was
a
greater
happiness
than
we
were
then
aware
of
for
lord
dartmouth
assured
me
some
time
after
that
whatever
stories
we
had
heard
and
believed
either
of
officers
or
seamen
he
was
confident
they
would
all
have
fought
very
heartily
but
now
by
the
immediate
hand
of
heaven
we
were
masters
of
the
sea
without
a
blow
i
never
found
a
disposition
to
superstition
in
my
temper
i
was
rather
inclined
to
be
philosophical
upon
all
occasions
yet
i
must
confess
that
this
strange
ordering
of
the
winds
and
seasons
just
to
change
as
our
affairs
required
it
could
not
but
make
a
deep
impression
on
me
as
well
as
on
all
that
observed
it
those
famous
verses
of
claudian
seemed
to
be
more
applicable
to
the
prince
than
to
him
they
were
made
on
heaven
favorite
for
whom
the
skies
do
fight
and
all
the
winds
conspire
to
guide
thee
right
the
prince
made
haste
to
exeter
where
he
stayed
ten
days
both
for
refreshing
his
troops
and
for
giving
the
country
time
to
show
its
affection
both
the
clergy
and
magistrates
of
exeter
were
very
fearful
and
very
backward
the
bishop
and
the
dean
ran
away
and
the
clergy
stood
off
though
they
were
sent
for
and
very
gently
spoken
to
by
the
prince
the
truth
was
the
doctrines
of
passive
obedience
and
had
been
carried
so
far
and
preached
so
much
that
clergymen
either
could
not
all
on
the
sudden
get
out
of
that
entanglement
into
which
they
had
by
long
thinking
and
speaking
all
one
way
involved
themselves
or
they
were
ashamed
to
make
so
quick
a
turn
yet
care
was
taken
to
protect
them
and
their
houses
everywhere
so
that
no
sort
of
violence
or
rudeness
was
offered
to
any
of
them
the
prince
gave
me
full
authority
to
do
this
and
i
took
so
particular
a
care
of
it
that
we
heard
of
no
complaints
the
army
was
kept
under
such
an
exact
discipline
that
everything
was
paid
for
where
it
was
demanded
though
the
soldiers
were
contented
with
such
moderate
entertainment
that
the
people
generally
asked
but
little
for
what
they
did
eat
we
stayed
a
week
at
exeter
before
any
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
about
came
in
to
the
prince
every
day
some
persons
of
condition
came
from
other
parts
the
first
were
lord
colchester
wharton
the
eldest
sons
of
the
earl
of
rivers
and
lord
wharton
russel
lord
russel
brother
and
the
earl
of
abingdon
the
king
came
down
to
salisbury
and
sent
his
troops
twenty
miles
farther
of
these
three
regiments
of
horse
and
dragoons
were
drawn
on
by
their
officers
lord
cornbury
and
colonel
langston
on
design
to
come
over
to
the
prince
advice
was
sent
to
the
prince
of
this
but
because
these
officers
were
not
sure
of
their
subalterns
the
prince
ordered
a
body
of
his
men
to
advance
and
assist
them
in
case
any
resistance
was
made
they
were
within
twenty
miles
of
exeter
and
within
two
miles
of
the
body
that
the
prince
had
sent
to
join
them
when
a
whisper
ran
about
among
them
that
they
were
betrayed
lord
cornbury
had
not
the
presence
of
mind
that
so
critical
a
thing
required
so
they
fell
in
confusion
and
many
rode
back
yet
one
regiment
came
over
in
a
body
and
with
them
about
a
hundred
of
the
other
two
this
gave
us
great
courage
and
showed
us
that
we
had
not
been
deceived
in
what
was
told
us
of
the
inclinations
of
the
king
army
yet
on
the
other
hand
those
who
studied
to
support
the
king
spirit
by
flatteries
told
him
that
in
this
he
saw
that
he
might
trust
his
army
since
those
who
intended
to
carry
over
those
regiments
were
forced
to
manage
it
with
so
much
artifice
and
dared
not
discover
their
design
either
to
officers
or
soldiers
and
that
as
soon
as
they
perceived
it
the
greater
part
of
them
had
turned
back
the
king
wanted
support
for
his
spirits
sunk
extremely
his
blood
was
in
such
fermentation
that
he
was
bleeding
much
at
the
nose
which
returned
oft
upon
him
every
day
he
sent
many
spies
over
to
us
they
all
took
his
money
and
came
and
joined
themselves
to
the
prince
none
of
them
returning
to
him
so
that
he
had
no
intelligence
brought
him
of
what
the
prince
was
doing
but
what
common
reports
brought
him
which
magnified
our
numbers
and
made
him
think
we
were
coming
near
him
while
we
were
still
at
exeter
he
heard
that
the
city
of
london
was
very
unquiet
news
was
brought
him
that
the
earls
of
devonshire
and
danby
and
lord
lumley
were
drawing
great
bodies
together
and
that
both
york
and
newcastle
had
declared
for
the
prince
lord
delamere
had
raised
a
regiment
in
cheshire
and
the
body
of
the
nation
did
everywhere
discover
their
inclinations
for
the
prince
so
evidently
that
the
king
saw
he
had
nothing
to
trust
to
but
his
army
and
the
among
them
was
so
apparent
that
he
reckoned
he
could
not
depend
on
them
so
that
he
lost
both
heart
and
head
at
once
but
that
which
gave
him
the
last
and
most
confounding
stroke
was
that
lord
churchill
and
the
duke
of
grafton
left
him
and
came
and
joined
the
prince
at
axminster
twenty
miles
on
that
side
of
exeter
after
this
he
could
not
know
on
whom
he
could
depend
the
duke
of
grafton
was
one
of
king
charles
sons
by
the
duchess
of
cleveland
he
had
been
some
time
at
sea
and
was
a
gallant
but
rough
man
he
had
more
spirit
than
anyone
of
that
spurious
race
he
made
answer
to
the
king
about
this
time
that
was
much
talked
of
the
king
took
notice
of
somewhat
in
his
behavior
that
looked
factious
and
he
said
he
was
sure
he
could
not
pretend
to
act
upon
principles
of
conscience
for
he
had
been
so
that
as
he
knew
little
of
religion
so
he
regarded
it
less
but
he
answered
the
king
that
though
he
had
little
conscience
yet
he
was
of
a
party
that
had
conscience
soon
after
that
prince
george
the
duke
of
ormond
and
lord
drumlanerick
the
duke
of
queensbury
eldest
son
left
him
and
came
over
to
the
prince
and
joined
him
when
he
was
come
as
far
as
the
earl
of
bristol
house
at
sherburn
when
the
news
came
to
london
the
princess
was
so
struck
with
the
apprehensions
of
the
king
displeasure
and
of
the
that
it
might
have
that
she
said
to
lady
churchill
that
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
it
and
would
leap
out
of
window
rather
than
venture
on
it
the
bishop
of
london
was
then
lodged
very
secretly
in
suffolk
street
so
lady
churchill
who
knew
where
he
was
went
to
him
and
concerted
with
him
the
method
of
the
princess
withdrawing
from
the
court
the
princess
went
sooner
to
bed
than
ordinary
and
about
midnight
she
went
down
a
back
stairs
from
her
closet
attended
only
by
lady
churchill
in
such
haste
that
they
carried
nothing
with
them
they
were
waited
for
by
the
bishop
of
london
who
carried
them
to
the
earl
of
dorset
whose
lady
furnished
them
with
everything
and
so
they
went
northward
as
far
as
northampton
where
that
earl
attended
on
them
with
all
respect
and
quickly
brought
a
body
of
horse
to
serve
for
a
guard
to
the
princess
and
in
a
little
while
a
small
army
was
formed
about
her
who
chose
to
be
commanded
by
the
bishop
of
london
of
which
he
too
easily
accepted
and
was
by
that
exposed
to
much
censure
footnote
and
berkeley
afterward
lady
fitzharding
the
back
stairs
were
made
a
little
before
for
that
purpose
the
princess
pretended
she
was
out
of
order
upon
some
expostulations
that
had
passed
between
her
and
the
queen
in
a
visit
she
received
from
her
that
night
therefore
said
she
would
not
be
disturbed
till
she
rang
her
bell
next
morning
when
her
servants
had
waited
two
hours
longer
than
her
usual
time
of
rising
they
were
afraid
something
was
the
matter
with
her
and
finding
the
bed
open
and
her
highness
gone
they
ran
screaming
to
my
father
lodgings
which
were
the
next
to
hers
and
told
my
mother
the
princess
was
murdered
by
the
priests
thence
they
went
to
the
queen
and
old
mistress
buss
asked
her
in
a
very
rude
manner
what
she
had
done
with
her
mistress
the
queen
answered
her
very
gravely
she
supposed
their
mistress
was
where
she
liked
to
be
but
did
assure
them
she
knew
nothing
of
her
but
did
not
doubt
they
would
hear
of
her
again
very
soon
which
gave
them
little
satisfaction
upon
which
there
was
a
rumor
all
over
whitehall
that
the
queen
had
made
away
with
the
these
things
put
the
king
in
an
inexpressible
confusion
he
saw
himself
now
forsaken
not
only
by
those
whom
he
had
trusted
and
favored
most
but
even
by
his
own
children
and
the
army
was
in
such
distraction
that
there
was
not
any
one
body
that
seemed
entirely
united
and
firm
to
him
a
foolish
ballad
was
made
at
that
time
treating
the
papists
and
chiefly
the
irish
in
a
very
ridiculous
manner
which
had
a
burden
said
to
be
irish
words
lero
that
made
an
impression
on
the
army
that
can
not
be
well
imagined
by
those
who
saw
it
not
the
whole
army
and
at
last
all
people
both
in
city
and
country
were
singing
it
perpetually
and
perhaps
never
had
so
slight
a
thing
so
great
an
effect
but
now
strange
counsels
were
suggested
to
the
king
and
queen
the
priests
and
all
the
violent
papists
saw
a
treaty
was
now
opened
they
knew
that
they
must
be
the
sacrifice
the
whole
design
of
popery
must
be
given
up
without
any
hope
of
being
able
in
an
age
to
think
of
bringing
it
on
again
severe
laws
would
be
made
against
them
and
all
those
who
intended
to
stick
to
the
king
and
to
preserve
him
would
go
into
those
laws
with
a
particular
zeal
so
that
they
and
their
hopes
must
be
now
given
up
and
sacrificed
forever
they
infused
all
this
into
the
queen
they
said
she
would
certainly
be
impeached
and
witnesses
would
be
set
up
against
her
and
her
son
the
king
mother
had
been
impeached
in
the
long
parliament
and
she
was
to
look
for
nothing
but
violence
so
the
queen
took
up
a
sudden
resolution
of
going
to
france
with
the
child
the
midwife
together
with
all
who
were
assisting
at
the
birth
were
also
carried
over
or
so
disposed
of
that
it
could
never
be
learned
what
became
of
them
afterward
the
queen
prevailed
with
the
king
not
only
to
consent
to
this
but
to
promise
to
go
quickly
after
her
he
was
only
to
stay
a
day
or
two
after
her
in
hope
that
the
shadow
of
authority
that
was
still
left
in
him
might
keep
things
so
quiet
that
she
might
have
an
undisturbed
passage
so
she
went
to
portsmouth
and
thence
in
a
she
went
over
to
france
the
king
resolving
to
follow
her
in
disguise
care
was
also
taken
to
send
all
the
priests
away
the
king
stayed
long
enough
to
get
the
answer
and
when
he
had
read
it
he
said
he
did
not
expect
so
good
terms
he
ordered
the
lord
chancellor
to
come
to
him
next
morning
but
he
had
called
secretly
for
the
great
seal
and
the
next
morning
being
december
about
three
in
the
morning
he
went
away
in
disguise
with
sir
edward
hales
whose
servant
he
seemed
to
be
they
passed
the
river
and
flung
the
great
seal
into
it
which
was
some
months
after
found
by
a
fisherman
near
foxhall
the
king
went
down
to
a
miserable
that
hales
had
provided
for
carrying
them
over
to
france
thus
a
great
king
who
had
yet
a
good
army
and
a
strong
fleet
did
choose
rather
to
abandon
all
than
either
to
expose
himself
to
any
danger
with
that
part
of
the
army
that
was
still
firm
to
him
or
to
stay
and
see
the
issue
of
a
parliament
some
put
this
mean
and
unaccountable
resolution
on
a
want
of
courage
others
thought
it
was
the
effect
of
an
and
of
some
black
thing
under
which
he
could
not
now
support
himself
and
they
who
censured
it
the
most
moderately
said
that
it
showed
that
his
priests
had
more
regard
for
themselves
than
for
him
and
that
he
considered
their
interests
more
than
his
own
and
that
he
chose
rather
to
wander
abroad
with
them
and
to
try
what
he
could
do
by
a
french
force
to
subdue
his
people
than
to
stay
at
home
and
be
shut
up
within
the
bounds
of
law
and
be
brought
under
an
incapacity
of
doing
more
mischief
which
they
saw
was
necessary
to
quiet
those
fears
and
jealousies
for
which
his
bad
government
had
given
so
much
occasion
it
seemed
very
unaccountable
since
he
was
resolved
to
go
that
he
did
not
choose
rather
to
go
in
one
of
his
yachts
or
frigates
than
to
expose
himself
in
so
dangerous
and
ignominious
a
manner
it
was
not
possible
to
put
a
good
construction
on
any
part
of
the
dishonorable
scene
which
he
then
acted
with
this
his
reign
ended
for
this
was
a
plain
deserting
of
his
people
and
exposing
the
nation
to
the
pillage
of
an
army
which
he
had
ordered
the
earl
of
feversham
to
disband
and
the
doing
this
without
paying
them
was
letting
so
many
armed
men
loose
upon
the
nation
who
might
have
done
much
mischief
if
the
execution
of
those
orders
that
he
left
behind
him
had
not
been
stopped
i
shall
continue
the
recital
of
all
that
passed
in
this
till
the
throne
which
he
now
left
empty
was
filled
he
was
not
got
far
when
some
fishermen
of
feversham
who
were
watching
for
such
priests
and
other
delinquents
as
they
fancied
were
making
their
escape
came
up
to
him
and
they
knowing
sir
edward
hales
took
both
the
king
and
him
and
brought
them
to
feversham
the
king
told
them
who
he
was
and
that
flying
about
brought
a
vast
crowd
together
to
look
on
this
astonishing
instance
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
worldly
greatness
when
he
who
had
ruled
three
kingdoms
and
might
have
been
the
arbiter
of
all
europe
was
now
in
such
mean
hands
and
so
low
an
equipage
the
people
of
the
town
were
extremely
disordered
with
this
accident
and
though
for
a
while
they
kept
him
as
a
prisoner
yet
they
quickly
changed
that
into
as
much
respect
as
they
could
possibly
pay
him
here
was
an
accident
that
seemed
of
no
great
consequence
yet
all
the
strugglings
which
that
party
have
made
ever
since
that
time
to
this
day
which
from
him
were
called
afterward
the
jacobites
did
rise
out
of
this
for
if
he
had
got
clear
away
by
all
that
could
be
judged
he
would
not
have
had
a
party
left
all
would
have
agreed
that
here
was
a
desertion
and
that
therefore
the
nation
was
free
and
at
liberty
to
secure
itself
but
that
following
upon
this
gave
them
a
color
to
say
that
he
was
forced
away
and
driven
out
till
now
he
scarce
had
a
party
but
among
the
papists
but
from
this
incident
a
party
grew
up
that
has
been
long
very
active
for
his
interests
footnote
and
desired
they
would
send
to
eastwell
for
the
earl
of
winchelsea
which
sir
basil
dixwell
put
a
stop
to
by
telling
him
surely
they
were
good
enough
to
take
care
of
him
which
occasioned
the
saying
he
found
there
was
more

out
again

finding

look
to
himself

that
he
was
now
exposed
to
the
rage
of
the
people
whom
he
had
provoked
with
so
particular
a
brutality
he
had
disguised
himself
to
make
his
escape

he
fell
into
the
hands
of
some
who
knew
him

was
insulted
by
them

as
much
scorn

rudeness
as
they
could
invent

after
many
hours
tossing
him
about
he
was
carried
to
the
lord
mayor
whom
they
charged
to
commit
him
to
the
tower
which
lord
lucas
had
then
seized
and
in
it
had
declared
for
the
prince
the
lord
mayor
was
so
struck
with
the
terror
of
this
rude
populace
and
with
the
disgrace
of
a
man
who
had
made
all
people
tremble
before
him
that
he
fell
into
fits
upon
it
of
which
he
died
soon
after
upon
the
news
of
the
king
desertion
it
was
proposed
that
the
prince
should
go
on
with
all
possible
haste
to
london
but
that
was
not
advisable
for
the
king
army
lay
so
scattered
through
the
road
all
the
way
to
london
that
it
was
not
fit
for
him
to
advance
faster
than
his
troops
marched
before
him
otherwise
any
resolute
officer
might
have
seized
or
killed
him
though
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
danger
a
great
deal
of
mischief
that
followed
would
have
been
prevented
by
his
speedy
advance
for
now
began
that
turn
to
which
all
the
difficulties
that
did
afterward
disorder
our
affairs
may
be
justly
imputed
two
gentlemen
of
kent
came
to
windsor
the
morning
after
the
prince
came
thither
they
were
addressed
to
me
and
they
told
me
of
the
accident
at
feversham
and
desired
to
know
the
pleasure
upon
it
i
was
affected
with
this
dismal
reverse
of
the
fortune
of
a
great
prince
more
than
i
think
fit
to
express
i
went
immediately
to
benthink
and
wakened
him
and
got
him
to
go
to
the
prince
and
let
him
know
what
had
happened
that
some
order
might
be
presently
given
for
the
security
of
the
king
person
and
for
taking
him
out
of
the
hands
of
a
rude
multitude
who
said
they
would
obey
no
orders
but
such
as
came
from
the
prince
the
prince
ordered
zuylestein
to
go
immediately
to
feversham
and
to
see
the
king
safe
and
at
full
liberty
to
go
whithersoever
he
pleased
but
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
king
being
at
feversham
came
to
london
all
the
indignation
that
people
had
formerly
conceived
against
him
was
turned
to
pity
and
compassion
the
privy
council
met
upon
it
some
moved
that
he
should
be
sent
for
others
said
he
was
king
and
might
send
for
his
guards
and
coaches
as
he
pleased
but
it
became
not
them
to
send
for
him
it
was
left
to
his
general
the
earl
of
feversham
to
do
what
he
thought
best
so
he
went
for
him
with
his
coaches
and
guards
and
as
he
came
back
through
the
city
he
was
welcomed
with
expressions
of
joy
by
great
numbers
so
slight
and
unstable
a
thing
is
a
multitude
and
so
soon
altered
at
his
coming
to
whitehall
he
had
a
great
court
about
him
even
the
papists
crept
out
of
their
and
appeared
at
court
with
much
assurance
the
king
himself
began
to
take
heart
and
both
at
feversham
and
now
at
whitehall
he
talked
in
his
ordinary
high
strain
justifying
all
that
he
had
done
only
he
spoke
a
little
doubtfully
of
the
business
of
magdalen
college
but
when
he
came
to
reflect
on
the
state
of
his
affairs
he
saw
it
was
so
soon
broken
that
nothing
was
now
left
to
deliberate
upon
so
he
sent
the
earl
of
feversham
to
windsor
without
demanding
any
passport
and
ordered
him
to
desire
the
prince
to
come
to
james
to
consult
with
him
of
the
best
way
for
settling
the
nation
when
the
news
of
what
had
passed
at
london
came
to
windsor
the
prince
thought
the
privy
council
had
not
used
him
well
who
after
they
had
sent
to
him
to
take
the
government
upon
him
had
made
this
step
without
consulting
him
now
the
scene
was
altered
and
new
counsels
were
to
be
taken
the
prince
heard
the
opinions
not
only
of
those
who
had
come
along
with
him
but
of
such
of
the
nobility
as
were
now
come
to
him
among
whom
the
marquis
of
halifax
was
one
all
agreed
that
it
was
not
convenient
that
the
king
should
stay
at
whitehall
neither
the
king
nor
the
prince
nor
the
city
could
have
been
safe
if
they
had
been
both
near
one
another
tumults
would
probably
have
arisen
out
of
it
the
guards
and
the
officious
flatterers
of
the
two
courts
would
have
been
unquiet
neighbors
it
was
thought
necessary
to
stick
to
the
point
of
the
king
deserting
his
people
and
not
to
give
up
that
by
entering
upon
any
treaty
with
him
and
since
the
earl
of
feversham
who
had
commanded
the
army
against
the
prince
was
come
without
a
passport
he
was
for
some
days
put
in
arrest
it
was
a
tender
point
now
to
dispose
of
the
king
person
some
proposed
rougher
methods
the
keeping
him
a
prisoner
at
least
till
the
nation
was
settled
and
till
ireland
was
secured
it
was
thought
his
being
kept
in
custody
would
be
such
a
tie
on
all
his
party
as
would
oblige
them
to
submit
and
be
quiet
ireland
was
in
great
danger
and
his
restraint
might
oblige
the
earl
of
tyrconnel
to
deliver
up
the
government
and
to
disarm
the
papists
which
would
preserve
that
kingdom
and
the
protestants
in
it
but
because
it
might
raise
too
much
compassion
and
perhaps
some
disorder
if
the
king
should
be
kept
in
restraint
within
the
kingdom
therefore
the
sending
him
to
breda
was
proposed
the
earl
of
clarendon
pressed
this
vehemently
on
account
of
the
irish
protestants
as
the
king
himself
told
me
for
those
that
gave
their
opinions
in
this
matter
did
it
secretly
and
in
confidence
to
the
prince
the
prince
said
he
could
not
deny
but
that
this
might
be
good
and
wise
advice
but
it
was
that
to
which
he
could
not
hearken
he
was
so
far
satisfied
with
the
grounds
of
this
expedition
that
he
could
act
against
the
king
in
a
fair
and
open
war
but
for
his
person
now
that
he
had
him
in
his
power
he
could
not
put
such
a
hardship
on
him
as
to
make
him
a
prisoner
and
he
knew
the
princess
temper
so
well
that
he
was
sure
she
would
never
bear
it
nor
did
he
know
what
disputes
it
might
raise
or
what
effect
it
might
have
upon
the
parliament
that
was
to
be
called
he
was
firmly
resolved
never
to
suffer
anything
to
be
done
against
his
person
he
saw
it
was
necessary
to
send
him
out
of
london
and
he
would
order
a
guard
to
attend
upon
him
who
should
only
defend
and
protect
his
person
but
not
restrain
him
in
any
sort
a
resolution
was
taken
of
sending
the
lords
halifax
shrewsbury
and
delamere
to
london
who
were
first
to
order
the
english
guards
that
were
about
the
court
to
be
drawn
off
and
sent
to
quarters
out
of
town
and
when
that
was
done
the
count
of
solms
with
the
dutch
guards
was
to
come
and
take
all
the
posts
about
the
court
this
was
obeyed
without
any
resistance
or
disorder
but
not
without
much
murmuring
it
was
midnight
before
all
was
settled
and
then
these
lords
sent
to
the
earl
of
middleton
to
desire
him
to
let
the
king
know
that
they
had
a
message
to
deliver
to
him
from
the
prince
he
went
in
to
the
king
and
sent
them
word
from
him
that
they
might
come
with
it
immediately
they
came
and
found
him
abed
they
told
him
the
necessity
of
affairs
required
that
the
prince
should
come
presently
to
london
and
he
thought
it
would
conduce
to
the
safety
of
the
king
person
and
the
quiet
of
the
town
that
he
should
retire
to
some
house
out
of
town
and
they
proposed
ham
the
king
seemed
much
dejected
and
asked
if
it
must
be
done
immediately
they
told
him
he
might
take
his
rest
first
and
they
added
that
he
should
be
attended
by
a
guard
who
should
only
guard
his
person
but
should
give
him
no
sort
of
disturbance
having
said
this
they
withdrew
the
earl
of
middleton
came
quickly
after
them
and
asked
them
if
it
would
not
do
as
well
if
the
king
should
go
to
rochester
for
since
the
prince
was
not
pleased
with
his
coming
up
from
kent
it
might
be
perhaps
acceptable
to
him
if
he
should
go
thither
again
it
was
very
visible
that
this
was
proposed
in
order
to
a
second
escape
they
promised
to
send
word
immediately
to
the
prince
of
orange
who
lay
that
night
at
sion
within
eight
miles
of
london
he
very
readily
consented
to
it
and
the
king
went
next
day
to
rochester
having
ordered
all
that
which
is
called
the
moving
wardrobe
to
be
sent
before
him
the
count
of
solms
ordering
everything
to
be
done
as
the
king
desired
a
guard
went
with
him
that
left
him
at
full
liberty
and
paid
him
rather
more
respect
than
his
own
guards
had
done
of
late
most
of
that
body
as
it
happened
were
papists
so
when
he
went
to
mass
they
went
in
and
assisted
very
reverently
and
when
they
were
asked
how
they
could
serve
in
an
expedition
that
was
intended
to
destroy
their
own
religion
one
of
them
answered
his
soul
was
god
but
his
sword
was
the
prince
of
orange
the
king
was
so
much
delighted
with
this
answer
that
he
repeated
it
to
all
that
came
about
him
on
the
same
day
the
prince
came
to
james
it
happened
to
be
a
very
rainy
day
and
yet
great
numbers
came
to
see
him
but
after
they
had
stood
long
in
the
wet
he
disappointed
them
for
he
who
loved
neither
shows
nor
shoutings
went
through
the
park
and
even
this
trifle
helped
to
set
people
spirits
on
edge
the
revolution
was
thus
brought
about
with
the
universal
applause
of
the
whole
nation
only
these
last
steps
began
to
raise
a
fermentation
it
was
said
here
was
an
unnatural
thing
to
waken
the
king
out
of
his
sleep
in
his
own
palace
and
to
order
him
to
go
out
of
it
when
he
was
ready
to
submit
to
everything
some
said
he
was
now
a
prisoner
and
remembered
the
saying
of
king
charles
i
that
the
prisons
and
the
graves
of
princes
lay
not
far
distant
from
one
another
the
person
of
the
king
was
now
struck
at
as
well
as
his
government
and
this
specious
undertaking
would
now
appear
to
be
only
a
disguised
and
designed
usurpation
these
things
began
to
work
on
great
numbers
and
the
posting
of
the
dutch
guards
where
the
english
guards
had
been
gave
a
general
disgust
to
the
whole
english
army
they
indeed
hated
the
dutch
besides
on
account
of
the
good
order
and
strict
discipline
they
were
kept
under
which
made
them
to
be
as
much
beloved
by
the
nation
as
they
were
hated
by
the
soldiery
the
nation
had
never
known
such
an
inoffensive
march
of
an
army
and
the
peace
and
order
of
the
suburbs
and
the
freedom
of
markets
in
and
about
london
were
so
carefully
maintained
that
in
no
time
fewer
disorders
had
been
committed
than
were
heard
of
this
winter
none
of
the
papists
or
jacobites
was
insulted
in
any
sort
the
prince
had
ordered
me
as
we
came
along
to
take
care
of
the
papists
and
to
secure
them
from
all
violence
when
he
came
to
london
he
renewed
these
orders
which
i
executed
with
so
much
zeal
and
care
that
i
saw
all
the
complaints
that
were
brought
me
fully
redressed
when
we
came
to
london
i
procured
passports
for
all
that
desired
to
go
beyond
the
sea
two
of
the
popish
bishops
were
put
in
newgate
i
went
thither
in
the
prince
name
i
told
them
the
prince
would
not
take
upon
him
yet
to
give
any
orders
about
prisoners
as
soon
as
he
did
that
they
should
feel
the
effects
of
it
but
in
the
mean
while
i
ordered
them
to
be
well
used
and
to
be
taken
care
of
and
that
their
friends
might
be
admitted
to
come
to
them
so
truly
did
i
pursue
the
principle
of
moderation
even
toward
those
from
whom
nothing
of
that
sort
was
to
be
expected
now
that
the
prince
was
come
all
the
bodies
about
the
town
came
to
welcome
him
the
bishops
came
the
next
day
only
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
though
he
had
once
agreed
to
it
yet
would
not
come
the
clergy
of
london
came
next
the
city
and
a
great
many
other
bodies
came
likewise
and
expressed
a
great
deal
of
joy
for
the
deliverance
wrought
for
them
by
the
prince
means
old
sergeant
maynard
came
with
the
men
of
the
law
he
was
then
near
ninety
and
yet
he
said
the
liveliest
thing
that
was
heard
of
on
that
occasion
the
prince
took
notice
of
his
great
age
and
said
that
he
had
outlived
all
the
men
of
the
law
of
his
time
he
answered
he
had
liked
to
have
outlived
the
law
itself
if
his
highness
had
not
come
over
the
first
thing
to
be
done
after
the
compliments
were
over
was
to
consider
how
the
nation
was
to
be
settled
the
lawyers
were
generally
of
opinion
that
the
prince
ought
to
declare
himself
king
as
henry
vii
had
done
this
they
said
would
put
an
end
to
all
disputes
which
might
otherwise
grow
very
perplexing
and
tedious
and
they
said
he
might
call
a
parliament
which
would
be
a
legal
assembly
if
summoned
by
the
king
in
fact
though
his
title
was
not
yet
recognized
this
was
plainly
contrary
to
his
declaration
by
which
the
settlement
of
the
nation
was
referred
to
a
parliament
such
a
step
would
make
all
that
the
prince
had
hitherto
done
pass
for
an
aspiring
ambition
only
to
raise
himself
and
it
would
disgust
those
who
had
been
hitherto
the
best
affected
to
his
designs
and
make
them
less
concerned
in
the
quarrel
if
instead
of
staying
till
the
nation
should
offer
him
the
crown
he
would
assume
it
as
a
conquest
these
reasons
determined
the
prince
against
that
proposition
he
called
all
the
peers
and
the
members
of
the
three
last
parliaments
that
were
in
town
together
with
some
of
the
citizens
of
london
when
these
met
it
was
told
them
that
in
the
present
distraction
the
prince
desired
their
advice
about
the
best
methods
of
settling
the
nation
it
was
agreed
in
both
these
houses
such
as
they
were
to
make
an
address
to
the
prince
desiring
him
to
take
the
administration
of
the
government
into
his
hands
in
the
the
next
proposition
passed
not
so
unanimously
for
it
being
moved
that
the
prince
should
be
likewise
desired
to
write
missive
letters
to
the
same
effect
and
for
the
same
persons
to
whom
writs
were
issued
out
for
calling
a
parliament
that
so
there
might
be
an
assembly
of
men
in
the
form
of
a
parliament
though
without
writs
under
the
great
seal
such
as
that
was
that
had
called
home
king
charles
ii
to
this
the
earl
of
nottingham
objected
that
such
a
convention
of
the
states
could
be
no
legal
assembly
unless
summoned
by
the
king
writ
therefore
he
moved
that
an
address
might
be
made
to
the
king
to
order
the
writs
to
be
issued
few
were
of
his
mind
the
matter
was
carried
the
other
way
and
orders
were
given
for
those
letters
to
be
sent
round
the
nation
the
king
continued
a
week
at
rochester
and
both
he
himself
and
everybody
else
saw
that
he
was
at
full
liberty
and
that
the
guard
about
him
put
him
under
no
sort
of
restraint
many
that
were
zealous
for
his
interests
went
to
him
and
pressed
him
to
stay
and
to
see
the
issue
of
things
a
party
would
appear
for
him
good
terms
would
be
got
for
him
and
things
would
be
brought
to
a
reasonable
agreement
he
was
much
distracted
between
his
own
inclinations
and
the
importunities
of
his
friends
the
queen
hearing
what
had
happened
writ
a
most
vehement
letter
to
him
pressing
his
coming
over
remembering
him
of
his
promise
which
she
charged
on
him
in
a
very
earnest
if
not
in
an
imperious
strain
this
letter
was
intercepted
i
had
an
account
of
it
from
one
that
read
it
the
prince
ordered
it
to
be
conveyed
to
the
king
and
that
determined
him
so
he
gave
secret
orders
to
prepare
a
vessel
for
him
and
drew
a
paper
which
he
left
on
his
table
reproaching
the
nation
for
their
forsaking
him
he
declared
that
though
he
was
going
to
seek
for
foreign
aid
to
restore
him
to
his
throne
yet
he
would
not
make
use
of
it
to
overthrow
either
the
religion
established
or
the
laws
of
the
land
and
so
he
left
rochester
very
secretly
on
the
last
day
of
this
memorable
year
and
got
safe
over
to
france
traill
the
convention
for
filling
the
vacant
throne
met
on
january
when
halifax
was
chosen
president
in
the
lords
powle
speaker
of
the
commons
a
letter
from
william
read
in
both
houses
informed
their
members
that
he
had
endeavored
to
the
best
of
his
power
to
discharge
the
trust
reposed
in
him
and
that
it
now
rested
with
the
convention
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
firm
security
for
their
religion
laws
and
liberties
the
prince
then
went
on
to
refer
to
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
protestants
in
ireland
and
the
present
state
of
things
abroad
which
obliged
him
to
tell
them
that
next
to
the
danger
of
unreasonable
divisions
among
themselves
nothing
could
be
so
fatal
as
too
great
a
delay
in
their
consultations
and
he
further
intimated
that
as
england
was
already
bound
by
treaty
to
help
the
dutch
in
such
exigencies
as
deprived
of
the
troops
which
he
had
brought
over
and
threatened
with
war
by
louis
xiv
they
might
easily
be
reduced
to
so
he
felt
confident
that
the
cheerful
concurrence
of
the
dutch
in
preserving
this
kingdom
would
meet
with
all
the
returns
of
friendship
from
protestants
and
englishmen
whenever
their
own
condition
should
require
assistance
to
this
the
two
houses
replied
with
an
address
thanking
the
prince
for
his
great
care
in
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
to
this
time
and
formally
continuing
to
him
the
same
commission
recommending
to
his
particular
care
the
present
state
of
ireland
william
answer
to
this
address
was
characteristic
both
of
his
temperament
and
his
preoccupation
my
lords
and
gentlemen
he
said
i
am
glad
that
what
i
have
done
hath
pleased
you
and
since
you
desire
me
to
continue
the
administration
of
affairs
i
am
willing
to
accept
it
i
must
recommend
to
you
the
consideration
of
affairs
abroad
which
makes
it
fit
for
you
to
expedite
your
business
not
only
for
making
a
settlement
at
home
on
a
good
foundation
but
for
the
safety
of
europe
on
the
the
commons
resolved
themselves
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
and
richard
hampden
son
of
the
great
john
was
voted
into
the
chair
the
honor
of
having
been
the
first
to
speak
the
word
which
was
on
everybody
lips
belongs
to
gilbert
dolben
son
of
a
late
archbishop
of
york
who
made
a
long
speech
tending
to
prove
that
the
king
deserting
his
kingdom
without
appointing
any
person
to
administer
the
government
amounted
in
reason
and
judgment
of
law
to
a
demise
sir
robert
howard
one
of
the
members
for
castle
rising
went
a
step
further
and
asserted
that
the
throne
was
vacant
the
extreme
tories
made
a
vain
effort
to
procure
an
adjournment
but
the
combination
against
them
of
whigs
and
their
own
moderates
was
too
strong
for
them
and
after
a
long
and
stormy
debate
the
house
resolved
that
king
james
ii
having
endeavored
to
subvert
the
constitution
by
breaking
the
original
contract
between
the
king
and
people
and
by
the
advice
of
jesuits
and
other
wicked
persons
having
violated
the
fundamental
laws
and
withdrawn
himself
out
of
the
kingdom
has
abdicated
the
government
and
that
the
throne
is
thereby
vacant
this
resolution
was
at
once
sent
up
to
the
lords
before
however
they
could
proceed
to
consider
it
another
message
arrived
from
the
commons
to
the
effect
that
they
had
just
voted
it
inconsistent
with
the
safety
and
welfare
of
this
protestant
nation
to
be
governed
by
a
popish
king
to
this
resolution
the
peers
assented
with
a
readiness
which
showed
in
advance
that
james
had
no
party
in
the
upper
house
and
that
the
utmost
length
to
which
the
tories
in
that
body
were
prepared
to
go
was
to
support
the
proposal
of
a
regency
the
first
resolution
of
the
commons
was
then
put
aside
in
order
that
this
proposal
might
be
discussed
it
was
archbishop
sancroft
plan
who
however
did
not
make
his
appearance
to
advocate
it
and
in
his
absence
it
was
supported
by
rochester
and
nottingham
while
halifax
and
danby
led
the
opposition
to
it
after
a
day
debate
it
was
lost
by
the
narrow
majority
of
two
peers
declaring
in
its
favor
and
against
it
the
lords
then
went
into
committee
on
the
commons
resolution
and
at
once
proceeded
as
was
natural
enough
to
dispute
the
clause
in
its
preamble
which
referred
to
the
original
contract
between
the
king
and
the
people
no
tory
of
course
could
really
have
subscribed
to
the
doctrine
implied
in
these
words
but
it
was
doubtless
as
hard
in
those
days
as
in
these
to
interest
an
assembly
of
english
politicians
in
affirmations
of
abstract
political
principle
and
some
tories
probably
thought
it
not
worth
while
to
multiply
causes
of
dissent
with
the
lower
house
by
attacking
a
purely
academic
recital
of
their
resolution
anyhow
the
numbers
of
the
minority
slightly
fell
off
only
peers
objecting
to
the
phrase
while
voted
that
it
should
stand
the
word
deserted
was
then
substituted
without
a
division
for
the
word
abdicated
and
the
hour
being
late
the
lords
adjourned
the
real
battle
of
course
was
now
at
hand
and
to
anyone
who
assents
to
the
foregoing
criticisms
it
will
be
evident
that
it
was
far
less
of
a
conflict
on
a
point
of
constitutional
principle
and
far
more
of
a
struggle
between
the
parties
of
two
distinct
one
can
not
call
them
rival
claimants
to
the
throne
than
whig
writers
are
accustomed
to
represent
it
it
would
of
course
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
whigs
insisted
on
declaring
the
vacancy
of
the
throne
because
they
wished
to
place
william
on
it
and
that
the
tories
contended
for
a
demise
of
the
crown
because
they
wished
an
english
princess
to
succeed
to
the
throne
rather
than
a
dutch
prince
still
it
is
pretty
certain
that
but
for
this
conflict
of
preferences
the
two
political
parties
who
had
made
so
little
difficulty
of
agreeing
in
the
declaration
that
james
had
ceased
to
reign
would
never
have
found
it
so
hard
to
concur
in
its
almost
necessary
sequence
that
the
throne
was
vacant
the
debate
on
the
last
clause
of
the
resolution
began
and
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
whigs
were
outnumbered
the
peers
who
had
supported
the
proposal
of
a
regency
which
implied
that
the
royal
title
was
still
in
james
were
bound
of
course
to
oppose
the
proposition
that
the
throne
was
vacant
and
they
were
reënforced
by
several
peers
who
held
that
that
title
had
already
devolved
upon
mary
an
attempt
to
compromise
the
dispute
by
omitting
the
words
pronouncing
the
throne
vacant
and
inserting
words
which
merely
proclaimed
the
prince
and
princess
of
orange
king
and
queen
was
rejected
by
votes
to
and
the
original
clause
was
then
put
and
negatived
by
votes
to
thus
amended
by
the
substitution
of
deserted
for
abdicated
and
the
omission
of
the
words
and
that
the
throne
is
thereby
vacant
the
resolution
was
sent
back
to
the
commons
who
instantly
and
without
a
division
disagreed
with
the
amendments
the
situation
was
now
becoming
critical
the
prospect
of
a
deadlock
between
the
two
branches
of
the
convention
threw
london
into
a
ferment
crowds
assembled
in
palace
yard
petitions
were
presented
in
that
tumultuous
fashion
which
converts
supplication
into
menace
to
their
common
credit
however
both
parties
united
in
resistance
to
these
attempts
at
popular
coercion
and
william
himself
interposed
to
enjoin
a
stricter
police
of
the
capital
on
monday
february
the
lords
resolved
to
insist
on
their
amendments
on
the
following
day
the
commons
reaffirmed
their
disagreement
with
them
by
two
hundred
votes
to
one
hundred
a
free
conference
between
the
two
houses
was
then
arranged
and
met
on
the
following
day
but
the
dispute
like
many
another
in
our
political
history
had
meanwhile
been
settled
out
of
court
between
the
date
of
the
peers
vote
and
the
conference
mary
had
communicated
to
danby
her
high
displeasure
at
the
conduct
of
those
who
were
setting
up
her
claims
in
opposition
to
those
of
her
husband
and
william
who
had
previously
maintained
an
unbroken
silence
now
made
unsolicited
a
declaration
of
a
most
important
and
indeed
of
a
conclusive
kind
if
the
convention
he
said
chose
to
adopt
the
plan
of
a
regency
he
had
nothing
to
say
against
it
only
they
must
look
out
for
some
other
person
to
fill
the
office
for
he
himself
would
not
consent
to
do
so
as
to
the
alternative
proposal
of
putting
mary
on
the
throne
and
allowing
him
to
reign
by
her
courtesy
no
man
he
said
can
esteem
a
woman
more
than
i
do
the
princess
but
i
am
so
made
that
i
can
not
think
of
holding
anything
by
apron
strings
nor
can
i
think
it
reasonable
to
have
any
share
in
the
government
unless
it
be
put
in
my
own
person
and
that
for
the
term
of
my
life
if
you
think
fit
to
settle
it
otherwise
i
will
not
oppose
you
but
will
go
back
to
holland
and
meddle
no
more
in
your
affairs
these
few
sentences
of
swept
away
the
clouds
of
intrigue
and
pedantry
as
by
a
wholesome
gust
of
wind
both
political
parties
at
once
perceived
that
there
was
but
one
possible
issue
from
the
situation
the
conference
was
duly
held
and
the
constitutional
question
was
with
great
display
of
now
unnecessary
learning
solemnly
debated
but
the
managers
for
the
two
houses
met
only
to
register
a
foregone
conclusion
the
word
abdicated
was
restored
the
vacancy
of
the
throne
was
voted
by
votes
to
and
it
was
immediately
proposed
and
carried
without
a
division
that
the
prince
and
princess
of
orange
should
be
declared
king
and
queen
of
england
it
now
only
remained
to
give
formal
effect
to
this
resolution
and
in
so
doing
to
settle
the
conditions
whereon
the
crown
which
the
convention
had
now
distinctly
recognized
itself
as
conferring
upon
the
prince
and
princess
should
be
conferred
a
committee
appointed
by
the
commons
to
consider
what
safeguards
should
be
taken
against
the
aggressions
of
future
sovereigns
had
made
a
report
in
which
they
recommended
not
only
a
solemn
enunciation
of
ancient
constitutional
principles
but
the
enactment
of
new
laws
the
commons
however
having
regard
to
the
importance
of
prompt
action
judiciously
resolved
on
carrying
out
only
the
first
part
of
the
programme
they
determined
to
preface
the
tender
of
the
crown
to
william
and
mary
by
a
recital
of
the
royal
encroachments
of
the
past
reigns
and
a
formal
assertion
of
the
constitutional
principles
against
which
such
encroachments
had
offended
this
document
drafted
by
a
committee
of
which
the
celebrated
somers
then
a
scarcely
known
young
advocate
was
the
chairman
was
the
famous
declaration
of
right
the
grievances
which
it
recapitulated
in
its
earlier
portion
were
as
follows
the
royal
pretension
to
dispense
with
and
suspend
laws
without
consent
of
parliament
the
punishment
of
subjects
as
in
the
seven
bishops
case
for
petitioning
the
crown
the
establishment
of
the
illegal
court
of
high
commission
for
ecclesiastical
affairs
the
levy
of
taxes
without
the
consent
of
parliament
the
maintenance
of
a
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
without
the
same
consent
the
disarmament
of
protestants
while
papists
were
both
armed
and
employed
contrary
to
law
the
violation
of
the
freedom
of
election
the
prosecution
in
the
bench
of
suits
only
cognizable
in
parliament
the
return
of
partial
and
corrupt
juries
the
requisition
of
excessive
bail
the
imposition
of
excessive
fines
the
infliction
of
illegal
and
cruel
punishments
the
grants
of
the
estates
of
accused
persons
before
conviction
then
after
solemnly
reaffirming
the
popular
rights
from
which
these
abuses
of
the
prerogative
derogated
the
declaration
goes
on
to
recite
that
having
an
entire
confidence
william
would
preserve
them
from
the
violation
of
the
rights
which
they
have
here
asserted
the
three
estates
do
resolve
that
william
and
mary
prince
and
princess
of
orange
be
and
be
declared
king
and
queen
to
hold
the
crown
and
royal
dignity
to
them
the
said
prince
and
princess
during
their
lives
and
the
life
of
the
survivor
of
them
and
the
sole
and
full
exercise
of
the
royal
power
be
only
in
and
exercised
by
the
said
prince
of
orange
in
the
names
of
the
said
prince
and
princess
during
their
lives
and
after
their
deceases
the
said
crown
and
royal
dignity
of
the
said
kingdoms
and
dominions
to
the
heirs
of
the
body
of
the
said
princess
and
for
default
of
such
issue
to
the
princess
anne
of
denmark
and
the
heirs
of
her
body
and
for
the
default
of
such
issue
to
the
issue
of
the
said
prince
of
orange
then
followed
an
alteration
required
by
the
scrupulous
conscience
of
nottingham

the
terms

oath

he
ruled
alone
until

death
february
he
is
distinguished
among
princes

a
ruler
who
temporarily
laid
aside
the
character
of
royalty
in

to
learn
the
art

governing
better
by
his
travels
under
a

in

he
acquired
fruits

observation
which
proved
of
greater
practical
advantage
in
his
career
than
comes

sovereigns
from
training
in

schools
his
restless
and
inquiring
spirit
was
never
subdued

by

two
sons
feodor

and
six

by
his
second
wife
natalia
narychkine
one
son
who
became
peter

and
two
daughters
as
he
was
twice
married
and
the
kinsmen
of
each
wife
had
according
to
custom
surrounded
the
throne
there
existed
two
factions
in
the
palace
which
were
brought
face
to
face
by
his
death
and
that
of
his
eldest
son
feodor
the
miloslavskis
had
on
their
side
the
claim
of
seniority
the
number
of
royal
children
left
by
maria
and
above
all
the
fact
that
ivan
was
the
elder
of
the
two
surviving
sons
but
unluckily
for
them
ivan
was
notoriously
imbecile
both
in
body
and
mind
on
the
side
of
the
narychkines
was
the
interest
excited
by
the
precocious
intelligence
of
peter
and
the
position
of
legal
head
of
all
the
royal
family
which
according
to
russian
law
gave
to
natalia
narychkine
her
title
of
czarina
dowager
both
factions
had
for
some
time
taken
their
measures
and
recruited
their
partisans
who
should
succeed
feodor
was
it
to
be
the
son
of
the
miloslavski
or
the
son
of
the
narychkine
the
miloslavskis
were
first
defeated
on
legal
grounds
taking
the
incapacity
of
ivan
into
consideration
the
boyars
and
the
patriarch
joachim
proclaimed
the
young
peter
then
nine
years
old
czar
the
narychkines
triumphed
natalia
became
czarina
regent
recalled
from
exile
her
matveef
and
surrounded
herself
by
her
brothers
and
uncles
the
miloslavskis
only
means
of
revenge
lay
in
revolt
but
they
were
without
a
head
for
it
was
impossible
for
ivan
to
take
the
lead
the
eldest
of
his
six
sisters
was
years
of
age
the
youngest
nineteen
the
most
energetic
of
them
was
sophia
who
was
these
six
princesses
saw
themselves
condemned
to
the
dreary
destiny
of
the
russian
and
were
forced
to
renounce
all
hopes
of
marriage
with
no
prospects
but
to
grow
old
in
the
seclusion
of
the
subjected
by
law
to
the
authority
of
a
all
their
youth
had
to
look
forward
to
was
the
cloister
they
however
only
breathed
in
action
and
though
imperial
etiquette
and
byzantine
manners
prejudices
and
traditions
forbade
them
to
appear
in
public
even
byzantine
traditions
offered
them
models
to
follow
had
not
pulcheria
daughter
of
an
emperor
reigned
at
constantinople
in
the
name
of
her
brother
the
incapable
theodosius
had
she
not
contracted
a
nominal
marriage
with
the
brave
marcian
who
was
her
sword
against
the
barbarians
here
was
the
ideal
that
sophia
could
propose
to
herself
to
be
a
a
to
emancipate
herself
from
the
rigorous
laws
of
the
terem
to
force
the
locks
of
the
song
to
raise
the
that
covered
her
face
to
appear
in
public
and
meet
the
looks
of
men
needed
energy
cunning
and
patience
that
could
wait
and
be
content
to
proceed
by
successive
efforts
sophia
first
step
was
to
appear
at
feodor
funeral
though
it
was
not
the
custom
for
any
but
the
widow
and
the
heir
to
be
present
there
her
litter
encountered
that
of
natalia
narychkine
and
her
presence
forced
the
to
retreat
she
surrounded
herself
with
a
court
of
educated
men
who
publicly
praised
her
encouraged
and
excited
her
to
action
simeon
polotski
and
silvester
medviedef
wrote
verses
in
her
honor
recalled
to
her
the
example
of
pulcheria
and
olga
compared
her
to
the
virgin
queen
elizabeth
of
england
and
even
to
semiramis
we
might
think
we
were
listening
to
voltaire
addressing
catharine
ii
they
played
on
her
name
sophia
wisdom
and
declared
she
had
been
endowed
with
the
quality
as
well
as
the
title
polotski
dedicated
to
her
the
of
and
medviedef
his
of
the
holy
the
terem
offered
the
strangest
contrasts
there
acted
they
the
and
the
audience
was
composed
of
the
heterogeneous
assembly
of
popes
monks
nuns
and
old
pensioners
that
formed
the
courts
of
the
ancient
czarinas
in
this
shifting
crowd
there
were
some
useful
instruments
of
intrigue
the
old
pensioners
while
telling
their
rosaries
served
as
emissaries
between
the
palace
and
the
town
carried
messages
and
presents
to
the
turbulent
and
arranged
matters
between
the
czarian
ladies
and
the
soldiers
sinister
rumors
were
skilfully
disseminated
through
moscow
feodor
the
eldest
son
of
alexis
had
died
the
victim
of
conspirators
the
same
lot
was
doubtless
reserved
for
ivan
what
was
to
become
of
the
poor
czarevni
of
the
blood
of
kings
at
last
it
was
publicly
announced
that
a
brother
of
natalia
narychkine
had
seized
the
crown
and
seated
himself
on
the
throne
and
that
ivan
had
been
strangled
love
and
pity
for
the
son
of
alexis
and
the
indignation
excited
by
the
news
of
the
usurpation
immediately
caused
the
people
of
moscow
to
revolt
and
the
ringleaders
cleverly
directed
the
movement
the
tocsin
sounded
from
four
hundred
churches
of
the
holy
city
the
regiments
of
the
streltsi
took
up
arms
and
marched
followed
by
an
immense
crowd
to
the
kremlin
with
drums
beating
matches
lighted
and
dragging
cannon
behind
them
natalia
narychkine
had
only
to
show
herself
on
the
red
staircase
accompanied
by
her
son
peter
and
ivan
who
was
reported
dead
their
mere
appearance
sufficed
to
contradict
all
the
calumnies
the
streltsi
hesitated
seeing
they
had
been
deceived
a
clever
harangue
of
matveef
who
had
formerly
commanded
them
and
the
exhortations
of
the
patriarch
shook
them
further
the
revolt
was
almost
appeased
the
miloslavskis
had
missed
their
aim
for
they
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
putting
to
death
the
people
of
whom
they
were
jealous
footnote
the
streltsi
were
an
ancient
muscovite
guard
composed
of
citizens
rendering
hereditary
military
service
in
the
different
cities
and
fortified
posts
at
this
time
many
of
them
were
ripe
for
revolt
suddenly
prince
michael
dolgorouki
chief
of
the
of
the
streltsi
began
to
insult
the
rioters
in
the
most
violent
language
this
harangue
awoke
their
fury
they
seized
dolgorouki
and
flung
him
from
the
top
of
the
red
staircase
onto
their
pikes
they
stabbed
matveef
under
the
eyes
of
the
czarina
then
they
sacked
the
palace
murdering
all
who
fell
into
their
hands
athanasius
narychkine
a
brother
of
natalia
was
thrown
from
a
window
onto
the
points
of
their
lances
the
following
day
the
recommenced
they
tore
from
the
arms
of
the
czarina
her
father
cyril
and
her
brother
ivan
the
latter
was
tortured
and
sent
into
a
monastery
historians
show
us
sophia
interceded
for
the
victims
on
her
knees
but
an
understanding
between
the
rebels
and
the
czarevna
did
exist
the
streltsi
obeyed
orders
the
following
days
were
consecrated
to
the
purifying
of
the
palace
and
the
administration
and
the
seventh
day
of
the
revolt
they
sent
their
commandant
the
khovanski
to
declare
that
they
would
have
two
czars
ivan
at
the
head
and
peter
as
coadjutor
and
if
this
were
refused
they
would
again
rebel
the
boyars
of
the
deliberated
on
this
proposal
and
the
greater
number
of
the
boyars
were
opposed
to
it
in
russia
the
absolute
power
had
never
been
shared
but
the
orators
of
the
terem
cited
many
examples
both
from
sacred
and
profane
history
pharaoh
and
joseph
arcadius
and
honorius
basil
ii
and
constantine
viii
and
the
best
of
all
the
arguments
were
the
pikes
of
the
streltsi
sophia
had
triumphed
she
reigned
in
the
name
of
her
two
brothers
ivan
and
peter
she
made
a
point
of
showing
herself
in
public
at
processions
solemn
services
and
dedications
of
churches
at
the
ouspienski
sobor
while
her
brothers
occupied
the
place
of
the
czar
she
filled
that
of
the
czarina
only
raised
the
curtains
and
boldly
allowed
herself
to
be
incensed
by
the
patriarch
when
the
challenged
the
heads
of
the
orthodox
church
to
discussion
she
wished
to
preside
and
hold
the
meeting
in
the
open
air
at
the
lobnoe
miesto
on
the
red
place
there
was
however
so
much
opposition
that
she
was
forced
to
call
the
assembly
in
the
palace
of
facets
and
sat
behind
the
throne
of
her
two
brothers
present
though
invisible
the
throne
used
on
those
occasions
is
still
preserved
at
moscow
there
is
an
opening
in
the
back
hidden
by
a
veil
of
silk
and
behind
this
sat
sophia
this
singular
piece
of
furniture
is
the
symbol
of
a
government
previously
unknown
to
russia
composed
of
two
visible
czars
and
one
invisible
sovereign
the
streltsi
however
felt
their
prejudices
against
female
sovereignty
awaken
they
shrank
from
the
contempt
heaped
by
the
czarevna
upon
the
ancient
manners
sophia
had
already
become
in
their
eyes
a
scandalous
person
another
cause
of
misunderstanding
was
the
support
she
gave
to
the
state
church
as
reformed
by
nicon
while
the
streltsi
and
the
greater
part
of
the
people
held
to
the
old
faith
she
had
arrested
certain
old
believers
who
at
the
discussion
in
the
palace
of
facets
had
challenged
the
patriarchs
and
orthodox
prelates
and
she
had
caused
the
ringleader
to
be
executed
khovanski
chief
of
the
streltsi
whether
from
sympathy
with
the
or
whether
he
wished
to
please
his
subordinates
affected
to
share
their
discontent
the
court
no
longer
felt
itself
safe
at
moscow
sophia
took
refuge
with
the
czarina
and
the
two
young
princes
in
the
fortified
monastery
of
troitsa
and
summoned
around
her
the
khovanski
was
invited
to
attend
was
arrested
on
the
way
and
put
to
death
with
his
son
the
streltsi
attempted
a
new
rising
but
with
the
usual
fickleness
of
a
popular
militia
suddenly
passed
from
the
extreme
of
insolence
to
the
extreme
of
humility
they
marched
to
troitsa
this
time
in
the
guise
of
suppliants
with
cords
round
their
necks
carrying
axes
and
blocks
for
the
death
they
expected
the
patriarch
consented
to
intercede
for
them
and
sophia
contented
herself
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
ringleaders
sophia
having
got
rid
of
her
accomplices
governed
by
aid
of
her
two
favorites
chaklovity
the
new
commandant
of
the
streltsi
whom
she
had
drawn
from
obscurity
and
who
was
completely
devoted
to
her
and
prince
vasili
galitsyne
galitsyne
has
become
the
hero
of
a
historic
school
which
opposes
his
genius
to
that
of
peter
the
great
in
the
same
way
as
in
france
henry
duke
of
guise
has
been
exalted
at
the
expense
of
henry
iv
he
was
the
special
favorite
the
intimate
friend
of
sophia
the
director
of
her
foreign
policy
and
her
right
hand
in
military
affairs
sophia
and
galitsyne
labored
to
organize
a
holy
league
between
russia
poland
venice
and
austria
against
the
turks
and
tartars
they
also
tried
to
gain
the
countenance
of
the
catholic
powers
of
the
west
and
in
jacob
dolgorouki
and
jacob
mychetski
disembarked
at
dunkirk
as
envoys
to
the
court
of
louis
xiv
they
were
not
received
very
favorably
the
king
of
france
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
make
war
against
the
turks
he
was
on
the
other
hand
the
ally
of
mahomet
iv
who
was
about
to
besiege
vienna
while
louis
blockaded
luxemburg
the
whole
plan
of
the
campaign
was
however
thrown
out
by
the
intervention
of
russia
and
john
sobieski
in
favor
of
austria
the
russian
ambassadors
received
orders
to
reëmbark
at
havre
without
going
farther
south
the
government
of
the
czarevna
still
persisted
in
its
warlike
projects
in
return
for
an
active
cooperation
against
the
ottomans
poland
had
consented
to
ratify
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
of
androussovo
and
to
sign
a
perpetual
peace
a
hundred
thousand
muscovites
under
the
command
of
prince
galitsyne
and
fifty
thousand
little
russian
cossacks
under
the
orders
of
the
hetman
samoilovitch
marched
against
the
crimea
the
army
suffered
greatly
in
the
southern
steppes
as
the
tartars
had
fired
the
grassy
plains
galitsyne
was
forced
to
return
without
having
encountered
the
enemy
samoilovitch
was
accused
of
treason
deprived
of
his
command
and
sent
to
siberia
and
mazeppa
who
owed
to
samoilovitch
his
appointment
as
and
whose
denunciations
had
chiefly
contributed
to
his
downfall
was
appointed
his
successor
in
the
spring
of
the
muscovite
and
ukranian
armies
commanded
by
galitsyne
and
mazeppa
again
set
out
for
the
crimea
the
second
expedition
was
hardly
more
fortunate
than
the
first
they
got
as
far
as
perekop
and
were
then
obliged
to
retreat
without
even
having
taken
the
fortress
this
double
defeat
did
not
hinder
sophia
from
preparing
for
her
favorite
a
triumphal
entry
into
moscow
in
vain
peter
forbade
her
to
leave
the
palace
she
braved
his
displeasure
and
headed
the
procession
accompanied
by
the
clergy
and
the
images
and
followed
by
the
army
of
the
crimea
admitted
the
generals
to
kiss
her
hand
and
distributed
glasses
of
brandy
among
the
officers
peter
left
moscow
in
anger
and
retired
to
the
village
of
preobrajenskoe
the
foreign
policy
of
the
czarevna
was
marked
by
another
display
of
weakness
by
the
treaty
of
nertchinsk
she
restored
to
the
chinese
empire
the
fertile
regions
of
the
amur
which
had
been
conquered
by
a
handful
of
cossacks
and
razed
the
fortress
of
albazine
where
those
adventurers
had
braved
all
the
forces
of
the
east
on
all
sides
russia
seemed
to
retreat
before
the
barbarians
meanwhile
peter
was
growing
his
precocious
faculties
his
quick
intelligence
and
his
strong
will
awakened
alike
the
hopes
of
his
partisans
and
the
fears
of
his
enemies
as
a
child
he
only
loved
drums
swords
and
muskets
he
learned
history
by
means
of
colored
prints
brought
from
germany
zotof
his
master
whom
he
afterward
made
the
archpope
of
fools
taught
him
to
read
among
the
heroes
held
up
to
him
as
examples
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
ivan
the
terrible
whose
character
and
position
offer
so
much
analogy
to
his
own
when
the
czarevitch
was
tired
of
reading
says
zabieline
zotof
took
the
book
from
his
hand
and
to
amuse
him
would
himself
read
the
great
deeds
of
his
father
alexis
mikhailovitch
and
those
of
the
czar
ivan
vasilievitch
their
campaigns
their
distant
expeditions
their
battles
and
sieges
how
they
endured
fatigues
and
privations
better
than
any
common
soldier
what
benefits
they
had
conferred
on
the
empire
and
how
they
extended
the
frontiers
of
russia
peter
also
learned
latin
german
and
dutch
he
read
much
and
widely
and
learned
a
great
deal
though
without
method
like
ivan
the
terrible
he
was
a
man
he
afterward
complained
of
not
having
been
instructed
according
to
rule
this
was
perhaps
a
good
thing
his
education
like
that
of
ivan
iv
was
neglected
but
at
least
he
was
not
subjected
to
the
enervating
influence
of
the
terem
he
was
not
cast
in
that
dull
mould
which
turned
out
so
many
idiots
in
the
royal
family
he
roamed
at
large
and
wandered
in
the
streets
with
his
comrades
the
streets
of
moscow
at
that
period
were
according
to
zabieline
the
worst
school
of
profligacy
and
debauchery
that
can
be
imagined
but
they
were
on
the
whole
less
bad
for
peter
than
the
palace
he
met
there
something
besides
mere
jesters
he
encountered
new
elements
which
had
as
yet
no
place
in
the
terem
but
contained
the
germ
of
the
regeneration
of
russia
he
came
across
russians
who
if
unscrupulous
were
also
unprejudiced
and
who
could
aid
him
in
his
bold
reform
of
the
ancient
society
he
there
became
acquainted
with
swiss
english
and
german
adventurers
with
lefort
with
gordon
and
with
timmermann
who
initiated
him
into
european
civilization
his
court
was
composed
of
leo
narychkine
of
boris
galitsyne
who
had
undertaken
never
to
flatter
him
of
andrew
matveef
who
had
marked
taste
for
everything
european
and
of
dolgorouki
at
whose
house
he
first
saw
an
astrolabe
he
played
at
soldiers
with
his
young
friends
and
his
grooms
and
formed
them
into
the
battalion
of
playmates
who
manoeuvred
after
the
european
fashion
and
became
the
kernel
of
the
future
regular
army
he
learned
the
elements
of
geometry
and
fortification
and
constructed
small
citadels
which
he
took
or
defended
with
his
young
warriors
in
those
fierce
battles
which
sometimes
counted
their
wounded
or
dead
and
in
which
the
czar
of
russia
was
not
always
spared
an
english
boat
stranded
on
the
shore
of
yaousa
caused
him
to
send
for
franz
timmermann
who
taught
him
to
manage
a
even
with
a
contrary
wind
he
who
formerly
like
a
true
boyar
of
moscow
had
such
a
horror
of
the
water
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
cross
a
bridge
became
a
determined
sailor
he
guided
his
boat
first
on
the
yaousa
then
on
the
lake
of
pereiaslavl
brandt
the
dutchman
built
him
a
whole
flotilla
and
already
in
spite
of
the
terrors
of
his
mother
natalia
peter
dreamed
of
the
sea
the
child
is
amusing
himself
the
courtiers
of
sophia
affected
to
observe
but
these
amusements
disquieted
her
each
day
added
to
the
years
of
peter
seemed
to
bring
her
nearer
to
the
cloister
in
vain
she
proudly
called
herself
autocrat
she
saw
her
stepmother
her
rival
lifting
up
her
head
galitsyne
confined
himself
to
regretting
that
they
had
not
known
better
how
to
profit
by
the
revolution
of
but
chaklovity
who
knew
he
must
fall
with
his
mistress
said
aloud
it
would
be
wiser
to
put
the
czarina
to
death
than
to
be
put
to
death
by
her
sophia
could
only
save
herself
by
seizing
the
throne
but
who
would
help
her
to
take
it
the
streltsi
but
the
result
of
their
last
rising
had
chilled
them
considerably
sophia
herself
while
trying
to
bind
this
formidable
force
had
broken
it
and
the
streltsi
had
not
forgotten
their
chiefs
beheaded
at
troitsa
now
what
did
the
emissaries
of
sophia
propose
to
them
again
to
attack
the
palace
to
put
leo
narychkine
and
other
partisans
of
peter
to
death
to
arrest
his
mother
and
to
expel
the
patriarch
they
trusted
that
peter
and
natalia
would
perish
in
the
tumult
the
streltsi
remained
indifferent
when
sophia
affecting
to
think
her
life
threatened
fled
to
the
dievitchi
monastery
and
sent
them
letters
of
entreaty
if
thy
days
are
in
peril
tranquilly
replied
the
streltsi
there
must
be
an
inquiry
chaklovity
could
hardly
collect
four
hundred
of
them
at
the
kremlin
the
struggle
began
between
moscow
and
preobrajenskoe
the
village
with
the
prophetical
name
the
transfiguration
or
regeneration
two
streltsi
warned
peter
of
the
plots
of
his
sister
and
for
the
second
time
he
sought
an
asylum
at
troitsa
it
was
then
seen
who
was
the
true
czar
all
men
hastened
to
range
themselves
around
him
his
mother
his
armed
squires
the
battalion
of
playmates
the
foreign
officers
and
even
the
streltsi
of
the
regiment
of
soukharef
the
patriarch
also
took
the
side
of
the
czar
and
brought
him
moral
support
as
the
foreign
soldiers
had
brought
him
material
force
the
partisans
of
sophia
were
cold
and
irresolute
the
streltsi
themselves
demanded
that
her
favorite
chaklovity
should
be
surrendered
to
the
czar
she
had
to
implore
the
mediation
of
the
patriarch
chaklovity
was
first
put
to
the
torture
and
made
to
confess
his
plot
against
the
czar
and
then
decapitated
medviedef
was
at
first
only
condemned
to
the
knout
and
banishment
for
heresy
but
he
acknowledged
he
had
intended
to
take
the
place
of
the
patriarch
and
to
marry
sophia
he
was
dishonored
by
being
imprisoned
with
two
sorcerers
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
in
a
cage
and
was
afterward
beheaded
galitsyne
was
deprived
of
his
property
and
exiled
to
poustozersk
sophia
remained
in
the
dievitchi
monastyr
subjected
to
a
hard
captivity
though
ivan
continued
to
reign
conjointly
with
his
brother
yet
peter
who
was
then
only
seventeen
governed
alone
surrounded
by
his
mother
the
narychkines
and
the
dolgoroukis
sophia
had
freed
herself
from
the
seclusion
of
the
terem
as
peter
had
emancipated
himself
from
the
seclusion
of
the
palace
to
roam
the
streets
and
navigate
rivers
both
had
behaved
scandalously
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
time
the
one
haranguing
soldiers
presiding
over
councils
walking
with
her
veil
raised
the
other
using
the
axe
like
a
carpenter
rowing
like
a
cossack
brawling
with
foreign
adventurers
and
fighting
with
his
grooms
in
mimic
battles
but
to
the
one
her
emancipation
was
only
a
means
of
obtaining
power
to
the
other
the
emancipation
of
russia
like
the
emancipation
of
himself
was
the
end
he
wished
the
nation
to
shake
off
the
old
trammels
from
which
he
had
freed
himself
sophia
remained
a
byzantine
peter
aspired
to
be
a
european
in
the
conflict
between
the
czarevna
and
the
czar
progress
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
dievitchi
monastyr
the
first
use
the
czar
made
of
his
liberty
was
to
hasten
to
archangel
there
deaf
to
the
advice
and
prayers
of
his
mother
who
was
astounded
at
this
unexpected
taste
for
salt
water
he
gazed
on
that
sea
which
no
czar
had
ever
looked
on
he
ate
with
the
merchants
and
the
officers
of
foreign
navies
he
breathed
the
air
which
had
come
from
the
west
he
established
a
dockyard
built
boats
dared
the
angry
waves
of
this
unknown
ocean
and
almost
perished
in
a
storm
which
did
not
prevent
the
skipper
peter
alexeievitch
from
again
putting
to
sea
and
bringing
the
dutch
vessels
back
to
the
holy
cape
unhappily
the
white
sea
by
which
since
the
time
of
ivan
iv
the
english
had
entered
russia
is
in
winter
in
order
to
open
permanent
communications
with
the
west
with
civilized
countries
it
was
necessary
for
peter
to
establish
himself
on
the
baltic
or
the
black
sea
now
the
first
belonged
to
the
swedes
and
the
second
to
the
turks
as
the
caspian
did
to
the
persians
who
was
first
to
be
attacked
the
treaties
concluded
with
poland
and
austria
as
well
as
policy
and
religion
urged
the
czar
against
the
turks
and
constantinople
has
always
been
the
point
of
attraction
for
orthodox
russia
peter
shared
the
sentiments
of
his
people
and
had
the
enthusiasm
of
a
crusader
against
the
infidel
notwithstanding
his
ardent
wish
to
travel
in
the
west
he
took
the
resolution
not
to
appear
in
foreign
lands
till
he
could
appear
as
a
victor
twice
had
galitsyne
failed
against
the
crimea
peter
determined
to
attack
the
barbarians
by
the
don
and
besiege
azov
the
army
was
commanded
by
three
generals
golovine
gordon
and
lefort
who
were
to
act
with
the
bombardier
of
the
preobrajenski
regiment
peter
alexeievitch
this
regiment
as
well
as
three
others
which
had
sprung
from
the
amusements
of
preobrajenskoe
the
semenovski
the
botousitski
and
the
regiment
of
lefort
were
the
heart
of
the
expedition
it
failed
because
the
czar
had
no
fleet
with
which
to
invest
azov
by
sea
because
the
new
army
and
its
chiefs
wanted
experience
and
because
jansen
the
german
engineer
by
peter
passed
over
to
the
enemy
after
two
assaults
the
siege
was
raised
this
check
appeared
the
more
grave
because
the
czar
himself
was
with
the
army
because
the
first
attempt
to
turn
from
the
amusements
of
preobrajenskoe
to
serious
warfare
had
failed
and
because
this
failure
would
furnish
arms
against
innovations
against
the
germans
and
the
heretics
against
the
new
tactics
it
might
even
compromise
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
the
work
of
regeneration
although
peter
had
followed
the
example
of
galitsyne
and
entered
moscow
in
triumph
he
felt
he
needed
revenge
he
sent
for
good
officers
from
foreign
countries
artillerymen
arrived
from
holland
and
austria
engineers
from
prussia
and
admiral
lima
from
venice
peter
hurried
on
the
creation
of
a
fleet
with
feverish
impatience
he
built
of
green
wood
galleys
a
hundred
rafts
and
seventeen
hundred
boats
or
barks
all
the
small
ports
of
the
don
were
metamorphosed
into
thousand
workmen
were
assembled
there
from
all
parts
of
the
empire
it
was
like
the
camp
of
boulogne
no
misfortune
neither
the
desertion
of
the
laborers
the
burnings
of
the
nor
even
his
own
illness
could
lessen
his
activity
peter
was
able
to
write
that
following
the
advice
god
gave
to
adam
he
earned
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
at
last
the
marine
caravan
the
russian
armada
descended
the
don
from
the
slopes
of
azov
he
wrote
to
his
sister
natalia
in
obedience
to
thy
counsels
i
do
not
go
to
meet
the
shells
and
balls
it
is
they
who
approach
me
but
tolerably
courteously
footnote
his
mother
died
in
his
brother
ivan
in
azov
was
blockaded
by
sea
and
land
and
a
breach
was
opened
by
the
engineers
preparations
were
being
made
for
a
general
assault
when
the
place
capitulated
the
joy
in
russia
was
great
and
the
streltsi
jealousy
of
the
success
of
foreign
tactics
gave
place
to
their
enthusiasm
as
christians
for
this
victory
over
islamism
which
recalled
those
of
kazan
and
astrakhan
the
effect
produced
on
europe
was
considerable
at
warsaw
the
people
shouted
long
live
the
czar
the
army
entered
moscow
under
triumphal
arches
on
which
were
represented
hercules
trampling
a
pacha
and
two
turks
under
foot
and
mars
throwing
to
the
earth
a
and
two
tartars
admiral

while
peter
promoted
to
the
rank
of
captain
followed
on
foot
jansen
destined
to
the
gibbet
marched
among
the
prisoners
peter
wished
to
profit
by
this
great
success
to
found
the
naval
power
of
russia
by
the
decision
of
the
three
thousand
families
were
established
at
azov
besides
four
hundred
kalmucks
and
a
garrison
of
moscow
streltsi
the
patriarch
the
prelates
and
the
monasteries
taxed
themselves
for
the
construction
of
one
vessel
to
every
eight
thousand
serfs
the
nobles
the
officials
and
the
merchants
were
seized
with
the
fever
of
this
holy
war
and
brought
their
contributions
toward
the
infant
navy
it
was
proposed
to
unite
the
don
and
the
volga
by
means
of
a
canal
a
new
appeal
was
made
to
the
artisans
and
sailors
of
europe
fifty
young
nobles
of
the
court
were
sent
to
venice
england
and
the
low
countries
to
learn
seamanship
and
shipbuilding
but
it
was
necessary
that
the
czar
himself
should
be
able
to
judge
of
the
science
of
his
subjects
he
must
counteract
russian
indolence
and
prejudice
by
the
force
of
a
great
example
and
peter
after
having
begun
his
career
in
the
navy
at
the
rank
of
skipper
and
in
the
army
at
that
of
bombardier
was
to
become
a
carpenter
of
saardam
he
allowed
himself
as
a
reward
for
his
success
at
azov
the
journey
to
the
west
in
admiral
lefort
and
generals
golovine
and
vosnitsyne
prepared
to
depart
for
the
countries
of
the
west
under
the
title
of
the
great
ambassadors
of
the
czar
their
suite
was
composed
of
two
hundred
seventy
persons
young
nobles
soldiers
interpreters
merchants
jesters
and
buffoons
in
the
cortège
was
a
young
man
who
went
by
the
name
of
peter
mikhailof
this
would
render
the
position
of
the
czar
easier
whether
in
his
own
personal
studies
or
in
delicate
negotiations
on
the
journey
to
riga
peter
allowed
himself
to
be
insulted
by
the
governor
but
laid
up
the
recollection
for
future
use
at
koenigsburg
the
prussian
colonel
sternfeld
delivered
to
peter
mikhailof
a
formal
brevet
of
master
of
artillery
the
great
ambassadors
and
their
travelling
companion
were
cordially
received
by
the
courts
of
courland
hanover
and
brandenburg
sophia
charlotte
of
hanover
afterward
queen
of
prussia
has
left
us
some
curious
notes
about
the
czar
then
years
of
age
he
astonished
her
by
the
vivacity
of
his
mind
and
the
promptitude
and
point
of
his
answers
not
less
than
by
the
grossness
of
his
manners
his
bad
habits
at
table
his
wild
timidity
like
that
of
a
badly
child
his
grimaces
and
a
frightful
twitching
which
at
times
convulsed
his
whole
face
peter
had
then
a
beautiful
brown
skin
with
great
piercing
eyes
but
his
features
already
bore
traces
of
toil
and
debauchery
he
must
have
very
good
and
very
bad
points
said
the
young
electress
and
in
this
he
represented
contemporary
russia
if
he
had
received
a
better
education
adds
the
princess
he
would
have
been
an
accomplished
man
the
suite
of
the
czar
were
not
less
surprising
than
their
master
the
muscovites
danced
with
the
court
ladies
and
took
the
stiffening
of
their
corsets
for
their
bones
the
bones
of
these
germans
are
devilish
hard
said
the
czar
leaving
the
great
embassy
on
the
road
peter
travelled
quickly
and
reached
saardam
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
he
took
a
lodging
at
a
blacksmith
procured
himself
a
complete
costume
like
those
worn
by
dutch
workmen
and
began
to
wield
the
axe
he
bargained
for
a
boat
bought
it
and
drank
the
traditional
pint
of
beer
with
its
owner
he
visited
cutleries
ropewalks
and
other
manufactories
and
everywhere
tried
his
hand
at
the
work
in
a
paper
manufactory
he
made
some
paper
however
in
spite
of
the
tradition
he
only
remained
eight
days
at
saardam
at
amsterdam
his
eccentricities
were
no
less
astonishing
he
neither
took
any
rest
himself
nor
allowed
others
to
do
so
he
exhausted
all
his
always
repeating
i
must
see
it
he
inspected
the
most
celebrated
anatomical
collections
engaged
artists
workmen
officers
and
engineers
and
bought
models
of
ships
and
collections
of
naval
laws
and
treaties
he
entered
familiarly
the
houses
of
private
individuals
gained
the
of
the
dutch
by
his
penetrated
into
the
recesses
of
the
shops
and
stalls
and
remained
lost
in
admiration
over
a
dentist
but
amid
all
these
distractions
he
never
lost
sight
of
his
aim
we
labor
he
wrote
to
the
patriarch
adrian
in
order
thoroughly
to
master
the
art
of
the
sea
so
that
having
once
learned
it
we
may
return
to
russia
and
conquer
the
enemies
of
christ
and
free
by
his
grace
the
christians
who
are
oppressed
this
is
what
i
shall
long
for
to
my
last
breath
he
was
vexed
at
making
so
little
progress
in
shipbuilding
but
in
holland
everyone
had
to
learn
by
personal
experience
a
naval
captain
told
him
that
in
england
instruction
was
based
on
principles
and
these
he
could
learn
in
four
months
so
peter
crossed
the
sea
and
spent
three
months
in
london
and
the
neighboring
towns
there
he
took
into
his
service
goldsmiths
and
architects
and
bombardiers
he
then
returned
to
holland
and
his
ship
being
attacked
by
a
violent
tempest
he
reassured
those
who
trembled
for
his
safety
by
the
remark
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
czar
of
russia
who
was
drowned
in
the
north
sea
though
much
occupied
with
his
technical
studies
he
had
not
neglected
policy
he
had
conversed
with
william
iii
but
did
not
visit
france
in
this
tour
for
louis
xiv
says
simon
had
procured
the
postponement
of
his
visit
the
fact
being
that
his
alliance
with
the
emperor
and
his
wars
with
the
turks
were
looked
on
with
disfavor
at
versailles
he
went
to
vienna
to
study
the
military
art
and
dissuaded
leopold
from
making
peace
with
the
sultan
peter
wished
to
conquer
kertch
in
order
to
secure
the
straits
of
ienikale
he
was
preparing
to
go
to
venice
when
vexatious
intelligence
reached
him
from
moscow
the
first
reforms
of
peter
his
first
attempts
against
the
national
prejudices
and
customs
had
raised
him
up
a
crowd
of
enemies
old
russia
did
not
allow
herself
quietly
to
be
set
aside
by
the
bold
innovator
there
was
in
the
interior
a
sullen
and
resolute
resistance
which
sometimes
gave
birth
to
bloody
scenes
the
revolt
of
the
streltsi
the
insurrection
of
astrakhan
the
rebellion
of
the
cossacks
and
later
the
trial
of
his
son
and
first
wife
are
only
episodes
of
the
great
struggle
already
the
priests
were
teaching
that
antichrist
was
born
now
it
had
been
prophesied
that
antichrist
should
be
born
of
an
adulteress
and
peter
was
the
son
of
the
wife
of
alexis
therefore
his
mother
natalia
was
the
false
virgin
the
adulterous
woman
of
the
prophecies
the
increasingly
heavy
taxes
that
weighed
on
the
people
were
another
sign
that
the
time
had
come
others
disgusted
by
the
taste
shown
by
the
czar
for
german
clothes
and
foreign
languages
and
adventures
affirmed
that
he
was
not
the
son
of
alexis
but
of
lefort
the
genevan
or
that
his
father
was
a
german
surgeon
they
were
scandalized
to
see
the
czar
like
another
gregory
otrepief
expose
himself
to
blows
in
his
military
amusements
the
lower
orders
were
indignant
at
the
abolition
of
the
long
beards
and
national
costume
and
the
at
the

anyone
ever
before
seen
a
czar
of
moscow
quit
holy

to
wander
in
the
kingdoms
of
foreigners
who
knew

among

what
dangers
might
he
not
encounter
then
a
singular
legend
was
invented
about
the
travels
of
the
czar
it
was
said
that
he
went
to
stockholm
disguised
as
a
merchant
and
that
the
queen
had
recognized
him
and
had
tried
in
vain
to
capture
him
according
to
another
version
she
had
plunged
him
in
a
dungeon
and
delivered
him
over
to
his
enemies
who
wished
to
put
him
in
a
cask
lined
with
nails
and
throw
him
into
the
sea
he
had
only
been
saved
by
a
streletz
who
had
taken
his
place
some
asserted
that
peter
was
still
kept
there
and
in
the
streltsi
and
raskolniks
of
astrakhan
still
gave
out
that
it
was
a
false
czar
who
had
come
back
to
moscow
the
true
czar
was
a
prisoner
at
stockholm
attached
to
a
stake
in
the
midst
of
this
universal
disturbance
caused
by
the
absence
of
peter
there
were
certain
symptoms
peculiarly
disquieting
the
muscovite
army
grew
more
and
more
hostile
to
the
new
order
of
things
in
peter
had
discovered
a
fresh
conspiracy
having
for
its
object
the
deliverance
of
sophia
and
at
the
very
moment
of
his
departure
from
russia
he
had
to
put
down
a
plot
of
streltsi
and
cossacks
headed
by
colonel
tsykler
those
of
the
streltsi
who
had
been
sent
to
form
the
garrison
of
azov
pined
for
their
wives
their
children
and
the
trades
they
had
left
in
moscow
when
in
the
absence
of
the
czar
they
were
sent
from
azov
to
the
frontiers
of
poland
they
again
began
to
murmur
what
a
fate
is
ours
it
is
the
boyars
who
do
all
the
mischief
for
three
years
they
have
kept
us
from
our
homes
two
hundred
deserted
and
returned
to
moscow
but
the
douma
fearing
their
presence
in
the
already
troubled
capital
expelled
them
by
force
they
brought
back
to
their
regiments
a
letter
of
sophia
you
suffer
she
wrote
later
it
will
become
worse
march
on
moscow
what
is
it
you
wait
for
there
is
no
news
of
the
czar
it
was
repeated
through
the
army
that
the
czar
had
died
in
foreign
lands
and
that
the
boyars
wished
to
put
his
son
alexis
to
death
it
was
necessary
to
march
on
moscow
and
exterminate
the
nobles
the
military
sedition
was
complicated
by
the
religious
fanaticism
of
the
raskolniks
and
the
demagogic
passions
of
the
popular
army
four
regiments
revolted
and
deserted
generals
schein
and
gordon
with
their
regular
troops
hastened
after
them
came
up
with
them
on
the
banks
of
the
iskra
and
tried
to
persuade
them
to
return
to
their
duty
the
streltsi
replied
by
a
petition
setting
forth
all
their
grievances
many
of
them
had
died
during
the
expedition
to
azov
suggested
by
lefort
a
german
a
heretic
they
had
endured
fatiguing
marches
over
burning
plains
their
only
food
being
bad
meat
their
strength
had
been
exhausted
by
severe
tasks
and
they
had
been
banished
to
distant
garrisons
moscow
was
now
a
prey
to
all
sorts
of
horrors
foreigners
had
introduced
the
custom
of
shaving
the
beard
and
smoking
tobacco
it
was
said
that
these
niemtsi
meant
to
seize
the
town
on
this
rumor
the
streltsi
had
arrived
and
also
because
romodanovski
wished
to
disperse
and
put
them
to
the
sword
without
anyone
knowing
why
a
few
were
sufficient
to
scatter
the
rebels
a
large
number
were
arrested
torture
the
gibbet
and
the
dungeon
awaited
the
captives
when
peter
hastened
home
from
vienna
he
decided
that
his
generals
and
his
douma
had
been
too
lenient
he
had
old
grievances
against
the
streltsi
they
had
been
the
army
of
sophia
in
opposition
to
the
army
of
the
czar
he
remembered
the
invasion
of
the
kremlin
the
massacre
of
his
family
her
terrors
in
troitsa
and
the
conspiracies
which
all
but
delayed
his
journey
to
the
west
at
the
very
time
that
he
was
travelling
in
europe
for
the
benefit
of
his
people
these
incorrigible
mutineers
had
forced
him
to
renounce
his
dearest
projects
and
had
stopped
him
on
the
road
to
venice
he
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
by
crushing
his
enemies
and
by
making
the
old
russia
feel
the
weight
of
a
terror
that
would
recall
the
days
of
ivan
iv
the
long
beards
had
been
the
standard
of
revolt
they
should
fall
on
august
he
ordered
all
the
gentlemen
of
his
court
to
shave
themselves
and
himself
applied
the
razor
to
his
great
lords
the
same
day
the
red
place
was
covered
with
gibbets
the
patriarch
adrian
tried
in
vain
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
czar
by
presenting
to
him
the
image
of
the
mother
of
god
why
hast
thou
brought
out
the
holy
icon
exclaimed

czar
retire
and
restore
it
to
its
place

that
i
venerate
god
and
his
mother
as
much
as
thyself
but
know
also
that
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
the
people
and
punish
the
rebels

october
there
arrived
at

first
instalment
of
two
hundred
thirty
prisoners
they
came
in
carts
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
nearly
all
already
broken
by
torture
and
followed
by
their
wives
and
children
who
ran
behind
chanting
a
funeral
wail
their
sentence
was
read
and
they
were
slain

several
officers
to

executioner

austrian
agent
who
as
an
has
left
us
an
authentic
account
of
the
executions
heard
that
five
rebel
heads
had
been
sent
into
the
dust
by
blows
from
an
axe
wielded
by
the
noblest
hand
in
russia
the
terrible
carpenter
of
saardam
worked
and
obliged
his
boyars
to
work
at
this
horrible
employment
seven
other
days
were
employed
in
this
way
a
thousand
victims
were
put
to
death
some
were
broken
on
the
wheel
and
others
died
by
various
modes
of
torture
the
removal
of
the
corpses
was
forbidden
for
five
months
moscow
had
before
its
eyes
the
spectacle
of
the
dead
bodies
hanging
from
the
battlements
of
the
kremlin
and
the
other
ramparts
and
for
five
months
the
streltsi
suspended
to
the
bars
of
sophia
prison
presented
her
the
petition
by
which
they
had
entreated
her
to
reign
two

were
buried

she
herself

after

put

and
stirred
the
new

colonists
to
throw
off
the
stuart
tyranny
represented
by

a
long
step
was
taken
in
the
development
of

the

oak
tradition
whether
or
not
resting

typifies
the
temper
of
that
as
it

ever

itself
in
the
crises
of
patriotic
development
in
this

sir
william
andros
an
englishman
was
colonial
governor
of
new
york
from
to
and
of
new
england
including
new
york
from
to
his
rule
was
on
the
model
dear
to
the
heart
of
his
royal
master
a
harsh
despotism
but
neither
strong
nor
wise
it
was
wretched
misgovernment
and
stupid
blundering
oppression
what
poor
success
andros
had
in
his
attempt
to
force
such
a
rule
upon
people
of
the
english
race
who
had
already
accustomed
themselves
to
a
large
measure
of
independence
and
elliott
account
briefly
but
fully
shows
while
colonies
are
poor
they
are
neglected
by
the
parent
state
when
they
are
able
to
pay
taxes
then
she
is
quite
ready
to
govern
them
she
is
willing
to
appoint
various
dependents
to
important
offices
and
to
allow
the
colonies
to
pay
liberal
salaries
she
likes
also
to
tax
them
to
the
amount
of
the
surplus
production
which
is
transferred
to
the
managers
in
the
surprising
as
this
is
it
is
what
many
call
government
and
is
common
everywhere
england
has
been
no
exception
to
this
and
her
practice
in
new
england
was
of
this
character
till
in
the
year
the
back
of
the
people
was
so
galled
that
it
threw
its
rider
with
violence
at
various
times
attempts
had
been
made
to
destroy
the
massachusetts
charter
at
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
in
the
enemies
of
the
puritans
roused
themselves
all
who
scented
the
breath
of
liberty
in
those
western
gales
all
who
had
been
disappointed
of
fond
hopes
in
those
infant
states
all
who
had
felt
in
new
england
too
the
iron
hand
of
ecclesiastical
tyranny
who
chafed
in
the
religious
manacles
which
there
as
everywhere
else
were
imposed
upon
the
minority
all
united
against
them
and
in
commissioners
were
sent
over
with
extraordinary
powers
the
colony
withstood
them
to
the
best
of
its
ability
but
at
last
in
a
was
issued
and
judgment
was
obtained
in
england
against
the
massachusetts
charter
in
the
quo
warranto
was
brought
over
by
edward
randolph
who
had
been
appointed
collector
of
the
port
of
boston
in
but
had
not
been
allowed
to
act
he
was
the
messenger
of
death
to
the
hopes
of
the
colony
the
deputies
refused
to
appear
in
england
and
plead
and
judgment
was
entered
up
against
them
at
last
in
and
the
charter
was
abrogated
charles
died
and
the
bitter
and
bigoted
james
ii
came
to
the
throne
in
the
colonists
then
had
rumors
that
colonel
kirke
the
fiercest
hater
of
the
nonconformists
in
england
was
coming
over
as
governor
which
filled
them
with
dread
the
colony
now
seemed
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
churchmen
or
worse
than
that
of
the
papists
for
such
was
james
rawson
secretary
of
the
colony
about
this
time
wrote
our
condition
is
awful
joseph
dudley
was
appointed
governor
and
acted
for
a
short
time
but
was
succeeded
by
sir
edmund
andros
who
arrived
december
with
a
commission
from
james
ii
to
take
upon
himself
the
absolute
government
of
all
new
england
andros
was
supposed
to
be
a
bigoted
papist
and
he
certainly
carried
matters
with
a
high
hand
the
poisoned
chalice
of
religious
despotism
which
these
pilgrims
had
commended
to
the
lips
of
roger
williams
the
browns
hutchinson
gorton
clarke
and
the
quakers
was
now
offered
to
their
own
lips
and
the
draught
was
bitter
first
the
press
was
muzzled
then
marriage
was
no
longer
free
the
minister
moody
was
imprisoned
six
months
in
new
hampshire
for
refusing
to
administer
the
communion
to
cranfield
and
others
according
to
the
manner
and
form
set
forth
in
the
of
common
the
congregational
ministers
were
as
mere
laymen
and
danger
menaced
public
worship
and
the
but
this
last
extremity
was
saved
them
by
the
necessity
which
james
was
under
of
securing
the
triumph
of
church
in
protestant
england
the
first
step
toward
which
was
the
proclamation
of
religious
toleration
this
of
course
secured
the
colonists
and
the
pilgrims
were
saved
that
fearful
misery
of
being
driven
out
from
their
own
cherished
altars
andros
carried
things
with
as
high
a
hand
in
massachusetts
as
his
master
did
in
england
absolute
subjection
they
both
insisted
on
besides
the
denial
of
political
and
religious
rights
the
practice
of
arbitrary
taxation
was
asserted
by
andros
and
all
titles
to
lands
were
questioned
in
the
brutal
phrase
of
the
time
it
was
declared
that
the
calf
died
in
the
cow
belly
that
is
having
no
rights
as
a
state
they
had
none
as
individuals
so
fees
fines
and
expenditures
impoverished
the
people
and
enriched
the
officials
all
seemed
lost
in
massachusetts
andros
went
down
to
hartford
in
connecticut
with
his
suite
and
with
sixty
troops
took
possession
of
the
government
there
and
demanded
the
charter
through
the
day
october
the
authorities
remonstrated
and
postponed
when
they
met
andros
again
in
the
evening
the
people
collected
much
excited
there
seemed
no
relief
their
palladium
their
charter
was
demanded
and
before
them
stood
andros
with
soldiers
and
drawn
swords
to
compel
his
demand
there
was
then
no
hope
and
the
roll
of
parchment
the
charter
with
the
great
royal
seal
upon
it
was
brought
forth
and
laid
upon
the
table
in
the
midst
of
the
excited
people
suddenly
without
warning
all
lights
were
extinguished
there
were
darkness
and
silence
followed
by
wonder
movement
and
confusion
what
meant
this
very
unparliamentary
conduct
or
was
it
a
gust
of
wind
which
had
startled
all
lights
were
soon
obtained
and
then
where
is
the
charter
was
the
question
that
went
round
the
assembly
what
means
this
cried
andros
in
anger
but
no
man
knew
where
the
charter
had
disappeared
to
neither
threats
nor
persuasion
brought
it
to
light
what
could
andros
do
clearly
nothing
for
the
authorities
had
done
all
that
could
be
asked
they
had
produced
the
charter
in
the
presence
of
andros
and
now
it
had
disappeared
from
his
presence
he
had
come
upon
a
fool
errand
and
some
sharp
yankee
captain
wadsworth
had
outwitted
him
where
was
the
charter
safely
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
great
oak
at
hartford
on
the
grounds
of
samuel
wyllys
there
it
remained
beyond
the
reach
of
tyranny
the
tree
known
as
the
charter
oak
stood
for
over
a
century
and
a
half
from
that
day
the
indians
had
always
prayed
that
the
tree
might
be
spared
they
have
our
thanks
andros
wrote
on
the
last
page
of
their
records
and
disappeared
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
connecticut
it
was
a
dark
time
for
liberty
in
new
england
and
a
dark
day
for
liberty
in
old
england
for
there
james
ii
and
his
unscrupulous
ministers
were
corruptly
grossly
and
illegally
trampling
down
the
rights
of
manhood
andros
was
doing
it
in
new
england
and
he
found
in
dudley
stoughton
clark
and
others
sons
of
new
england
ready
feet
in
randolph
writes
we
are
as
arbitrary
as
the
great
turk
which
seems
to
have
been
true
the
hearts
of
the
best
men
in
both
countries
sank
within
them
and
they
cried
in
their
discouragement
o
lord
how
long
thus
matters
stood
when
during
the
spring
of
faint
rumors
of
the
landing
of
william
prince
of
orange
in
england
came
from
virginia
could
this
be
true
it
brought
andros
up
to
boston
april
where
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
soldiers
ready
against
surprise
liberty
is
the
most
ardent
wish
of
a
brave
and
noble
people
and
is
too
often
betrayed
by
confidence
in
cultivated
and
designing
and
timid
men
liberty
was
the
wish
of
the
people
of
new
england
and
for
the
want
of
brave
men
then
and
since
then
they
suffered
when
on
april
john
winslow
brought
from
virginia
the
rumor
of
the
english
revolution
and
the
landing
of
the
prince
of
orange
it
went
through
their
blood
like
the
electric
current
and
thrilled
from
the
city
along
the
byways
into
every
home
men
got
on
their
horses
and
rode
onward
to
the
next
house
to
carry
the
tidings
that
the
popish
king
was
down
and
william
was
up
and
that
there
was
hope
through
town
and
country
the
questions
were
eagerly
asked
shall
we
get
our
old
charter
shall
we
regain
our
rights
what
is
there
for
us
to
do
cried
the
people
andros
put
out
a
proclamation
that
all
persons
should
be
in
readiness
to
resist
the
forces
of
the
prince
of
orange
should
they
come
but
the
old
magistrates
and
leaders
silently
prayed
for
his
success
the
people
less
cautious
and
more
determined
said
to
one
another
let
us
do
something
why
not
act
and
this
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
their
hatred
of
andros
and
the
remembrance
to
his
dastardly
oppressions
blazed
into
a
consuming
fire
on
april
wrote
an
onlooker
i
knew
not
anything
of
what
was
intended
until
it
was
begun
yet
being
at
the
north
end
of
the
town
where
i
saw
boys
running
along
the
streets
with
clubs
in
their
hands
encouraging
one
another
to
fight
i
began
to
mistrust
what
was
intended
and
hasting
toward
the
town
dock
i
soon
saw
men
running
for
their
arms
but
before
i
got
to
the
red
lion
i
was
told
that
captain
george
and
the
master
of
the
frigate
were
seized
and
secured
in
colman
house
at
the
north
end
and
when
i
came
to
the
town
dock
i
understood
that
bullivant
and
some
others
were
laid
hold
of
and
then
immediately
the
drums
began
to
beat
and
the
people
hastened
and
ran
some
with
and
some
for
arms
etc
so
it
was
begun
no
one
knew
by
whom
but
men
remembered
yet
their
old
liberties
and
were
ready
to
risk
something
to
regain
them
they
remembered
too
their
present
tyrants
and
longed
to
punish
them
but
in
all
this
men
of
property
took
no
part
they
are
always
timid
it
was
the
mob
that
acted
governor
andros
was
at
the
fort
with
some
soldiers
and
sent
for
the
clergymen
to
come
to
him
who
declined
the
people
and
rallied
together
at
the
town
house
where
old
governor
bradstreet
and
some
other
principal
men
met
to
consult
as
to
what
should
be
done
the
king
frigate
in
the
harbor
ran
up
her
flags
and
the
lieutenant
swore
he
would
die
before
she
should
be
taken
and
he
opened
her
ports
and
ran
out
her
guns
but
captain
george
prisoner
in
boston
sent
him
word
not
to
fire
a
shot
for
the
people
would
tear
him
in
pieces
if
he
did
in
the
afternoon
the
soldiers
and
people
marched
to
the
fort
took
possession
of
a
battery
turned
its
guns
upon
the
fort
and
demanded
its
surrender
they
did
not
wait
for
its
surrender
but
stormed
in
through
the
portholes
and
captain
john
nelson
a
boston
merchant
cried
out
to
andros
i
demand
your
surrender
andros
was
surprised
at
the
anger
of
an
outraged
people
and
knew
not
what
to
do
but
at
last
gave
up
the
fort
and
was
lodged
prisoner
in
mr
house
the
next
day
he
was
forced
to
give
up
the
castle
in
the
harbor
and
the
guns
of
the
battery
from
the
shore
were
brought
to
bear
upon
the
frigate
but
the
captain
prayed
that
she
might
not
be
forced
to
surrender
because
all
the
officers
and
crew
would
lose
their
wages
so
she
was
dismantled
for
present
security
all
through
the
day
people
came
pouring
in
from
the
country
well
armed
and
hot
with
rage
against
andros
and
his
confederates
and
the
cooler
men
trembled
lest
some
unnecessary
violence
might
be
done
so
captain
fisher
of
dedham
led
andros
by
the
collar
of
the
coat
back
to
the
fort
for
safety
on
the
bradstreet
and
other
leading
men
met
and
formed
a
kind
of
provisional
council
they
carefully
abstained
from
resuming
their
old
charter
partly
from
fear
and
partly
from
doubt
and
called
upon
the
towns
to
send
up
deputies
when
these
met
on
may
forty
out
of
were
for
resuming
but
a
majority
of
the
council
opposed
it
and
time
was
spent
in
disputes
but
at
last
the
old
governor
and
magistrates
accepted
the
control
of
affairs
though
they
would
not
consent
to
resume
the
charter
thus
the
moment
for
action
passed
and
the
colony
lost
that
chance
for
reestablishing
its
old
rights
rhode
island
and
connecticut
resumed
their
charters
which
had
never
been
legally
vacated
mr
threat
was
obliged
to
take
again
the
office
of
governor
of
connecticut
when
the
amazing
reports
of
the
revolution
and
seizure
of
the
governor
in
massachusetts
reached
them
they
issued
loyal
addresses
to
william
and
mary
in
which
they
said
great
was
that
day
when
the
lord
who
sitteth
upon
the
floods
did
divide
his
and
your
adversaries
like
the
waters
of
jordan
and
did
begin
to
magnify
you
like
joshua
by
the
deliverance
of
the
english
dominions
from
popery
and
slavery
andros
escaped
but
was
apprehended
at
rhode
island
and
sent
back
to
boston
and
in
february
with
dudley
and
some
others
he
was
sent
away
to
england
increase
mather
the
agent
of
the
massachusetts
bay
colony
with
the
aid
of
friends
in
england
endeavored
to
gain
the
restoration
of
the
old
charter
from
king
william
but
was
unsuccessful
a
new
one
was
granted
which
contained
many
of
the
old
privileges
but
the
king
would
not
grant
them
the
power
of
appointing
their
own
governor
that
power
was
reserved
and
appeals
from
the
colony
courts
to
england
were
allowed
the
governor
and
the
king
both
had
a
veto
upon
all
colonial
legislation
by
it
all
religions
except
the
roman
catholic
were
declared
free
and
plymouth
was
annexed
to
massachusetts
thus
two
important
elements
of
a
free
government
were
lost
to
massachusetts
and
powers
which
had
been
exercised
over
fifty
years
were
for
nigh
a
hundred
years
taken
away
in
connecticut
and
rhode
island
they
continued
to
elect
their
own
rulers
and
to
exercise
all
the
powers
of
government
the
new
charter
was
brought
over
by
sir
william
phipps
the
new
governor
appointed
by
the
king
who
arrived
on
may
thus
ended
the
rule
of
the
theocracy
in
massachusetts
and
from
this
time
forward
the
ministers
and
possessed
no
more
power
than
the
rest
of

first
administration
of
canada
when
the
colony
of
new
france
was
under
the
rule
of
de
la
barre
and
his
successor
the
marquis
de
denonville
montreal
and
its
immediate
vicinity
suffered
from
the
most
terrible
and
bloody
of
all
the
indian
massacres
of
the
colonial
days
the
hatred
of
the
five
nations
for
the
french
stimulated
by
the
british
colonists
of
new
york
under
its
governor
colonel
dongan
was
due
to
french
forays
on
the
seneca
tribes
and
to
the
capture
and
forwarding
to
the
royal
galleys
in
france
of
many
of
the
betrayed
iroquois
chiefs
at
this
period
the
english
on
the
seaboard
began
to
extend
their
trade
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
and
to
divert
commerce
from
the
lawrence
to
the
hudson
this
gave
rise
to
keen
rivalries
between
the
two
european
races
and
led
the
english
to
take
sides
with
the
iroquois
in
their
enmity
to
the
french
the
latter
at
governor
denonville
instigation
sought
to
settle
accounts
summarily
with
the
iroquois
believing
that
the
tribes
of
the
five
nations
could
never
be
conciliated
and
that
it
was
well
to
extirpate
them
at
once
soon
the
governor
put
his
fell
purpose
into
effect
with
a
force
of
two
thousand
men
in
a
fleet
of
canoes
he
entered
the
seneca
country
by
the
genesee
river
and
for
ten
days
ravaged
the
iroquois
homes
and
put
many
of
them
cruelly
to
death
returning
by
the
niagara
river
he
erected
and
garrisoned
a
fort
at
its
mouth
and
then
withdrew
to
québec
a
terrible
revenge
was
taken
on
the
french
colonists
for
these
infamous
acts
as
the
following
article
by
garneau
shows
the
situation
of
the
colonists
of
new
france
during
the
critical
era
of
denonville
administration
was
certainly
anything
but
enviable
they
literally
dwelt
in
the
midst
of
alarms
yet
their
steady
courage
in
facing
perils
and
their
endurance
of
privations
when
unavoidable
were
worthy
of
admiration
a
lively
idea
of
what
they
had
to
resist
or
to
suffer
may
be
found
by
reading
the
more
particular
parts
of
the
despatches
to
paris
for
instance
in
one
of
these
he
wrote
in
reference
to
the
raids
of
the
iroquois
the
savages
are
just
so
many
animals
of
prey
scattered
through
a
vast
forest
whence
they
are
ever
ready
to
issue
to
raven
and
kill
in
the
adjoining
countries
after
their
ravages
to
go
in
pursuit
of
them
is
a
constant
but
almost
bootless
task
they
have
no
settled
place
whither
they
can
be
traced
with
any
certainty
they
must
be
watched
everywhere
and
long
waited
for
with
ready
primed
many
of
their
could
be
reached
only
by
or
by
other
savages
as
our
trackers
but
those
in
our
service
are
few
and
the
native
allies
we
have
are
seldom
trustworthy
they
fear
the
enemy
more
than
they
love
us
and
they
dread
on
their
own
selfish
account
to
drive
the
iroquois
to
extremity
it
has
been
resolved
in
the
present
strait
to
erect
a
fort
in
every
seigniory
as
a
place
of
shelter
for
helpless
people
and
at
times
when
the
open
country
is
overrun
with
ravagers
as
matters
now
stand
the
arable
grounds
lie
wide
apart
and
are
so
begirt
with
bush
that
every
thicket
around
serves
as
a
point
for
attack
by
a
savage
foe
insomuch
that
an
army
broken
up
into
scattered
posts
would
be
needful
to
protect
the
cultivators
of
our
cleared
lands
footnote
letter
to
seignelai
august
nevertheless
at
one
time
hopes
were
entertained
that
more
peaceful
times
were
coming
in
effect
negotiations
with
the
five
nations
were
recommenced
and
the
winter
of
was
passed
in
goings
to
and
fro
between
the
colonial
authorities
and
the
leaders
of
the
iroquois
with
whom
several
conferences
were
holden
a
correspondence
too
was
maintained
by
the
governor
with
colonel
dongan
at
new
york
the
latter
intimating
in
one
of
his
letters
that
he
had
formed
a
league
of
all
the
iroquois
tribes
and
put
arms
in
their
hands
to
enable
them
to
defend
british
colonial
territory
against
all
comers
the
iroquois
confederation
itself
sent
a
deputation
to
canada
which
was
escorted
as
far
as
lake
françois
by
twelve
hundred
warriors
a
significant
demonstration
enough
the
envoys
after
having
put
forward
their
pretensions
with
much
stateliness
and
yet
more
address
said
that
nevertheless
their
people
did
not
mean
to
press
for
all
the
advantages
they
had
the
right
and
the
power
to
demand
they
intimated
that
they
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
colony
that
the
iroquois
could
at
any
time
burn
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
pillage
their
stores
waste
their
crops
and
afterward
easily
raze
the
forts
the
in
reply
to
these
not
quite
unfounded
boastings
and
arrogant
assumptions
said
that
colonel
dongan
claimed
the
iroquois
as
english
subjects
and
admonished
the
deputies
that
if
such
were
the
case
then
they
must
act
according
to
his
orders
which
would
necessarily
be
pacific
france
and
england
not
now
being
at
war
whereupon
the
deputies
responded
as
others
had
done
before
that
the
confederation
formed
an
independent
power
that
it
had
always
resisted
french
as
well
as
english
supremacy
over
its
subjects
and
that
the
coalesced
iroquois
would
be
neutral
or
friends
or
else
enemies
to
one
or
both
at
discretion
for
we
have
never
been
conquered
by
either
of
you
they
said
adding
that
as
they
held
their
country
immediately
from
god
they
acknowledge
no
other
master
it
did
not
appear
however
that
there
was
a
perfect
accordance
among
the
envoys
on
all
points
for
the
deputies
from
onnontaguez
the
onneyouths
and
goyogouins
agreed
to
a
truce
on
conditions
proposed
by
denonville
namely
that
all
the
native
allies
of
the
french
should
be
comprehended
in
the
treaty
they
undertook
that
deputies
others
than
some
of
those
present
should
be
sent
from
the
agniers
and
tsonnouthouan
cantons
who
were
then
to
take
part
in
concluding
a
treaty
that
all
hostilities
should
cease
on
every
side
and
that
the
french
should
be
allowed
to
revictual
undisturbed
the
fort
of
cataracoui
the
truce
having
been
agreed
to
on
those
bases
five
of
the
iroquois
remained
one
for
each
canton
as
hostages
for
its
terms
being
observed
faithfully
notwithstanding
this
precaution
several
roving
bands
of
iroquois
not
advertised
possibly
of
what
was
pending
continued
to
kill
our
people
burn
their
dwellings
and
slaughter
in
different
parts
of
the
colony
for
example
at
françois
at
sorel
at
contrecoeur
and
at
st
ours
these
outrages
however
it
must
be
owned
did
not
long
continue
and
roving
corps
of
savages
either
singly
or
by
concert
drew
off
from
the
invaded
country
and
allowed
its
harassed
people
a
short
at
least
the
native
allies
of
the
french
on
the
other
hand
respected
the
truce
little
more
than
the
iroquois
the
abenaquis
invaded
the
agniers
canton
and
even
penetrated
to
the
english
settlements
scalping
several
persons
the
iroquois
of
the
sault
and
of
la
montagne
did
the
like
but
the
hurons
of
michilimackinac
supposed
to
be
those
most
averse
to
the
war
did
all
they
could
and
most
successfully
too
to
prevent
a
peace
being
signed
while
the
negotiations
were
in
progress
the
machiavel
of
the
wilderness
as
raynal
designates
a
huron
chief
bearing
the
native
name
of
kondiarak
but
better
known
as
le
rat
in
the
colonial
annals
arrived
at
frontenac
kingston
with
a
chosen
band
of
his
tribe
and
became
a
means
of
complicating
yet
more
the
difficulties
of
the
crisis
he
was
the
most
enterprising
brave
and
chief
in
all
north
america
and
as
such
was
one
courted
by
the
governor
in
hopes
of
his
becoming
a
valuable
auxiliary
to
the
french
although
at
first
one
of
their
most
formidable
enemies
he
now
came
prepared
to
battle
in
their
favor
and
eager
to
signalize
himself
in
the
service
of
his
new
masters
the
time
however
as
we
may
well
suppose
was
not
opportune
and
he
was
informed
that
a
treaty
with
the
iroquois
being
far
advanced
and
their
deputies
on
the
way
to
montreal
to
conclude
it
he
would
give
umbrage
to
the
of
canada
should
he
persevere
in
the
hostilities
he
had
been
already
carrying
on
the
rat
was
taken
aback
on
hearing
this
to
him
unwelcome
news
but
took
care
to
hide
his
surprise
and
uttered
no
complaint
yet
was
he
mortally
offended
that
the
french
should
have
gone
so
far
in
the
matter
without
the
concert
of
their
native
allies
and
he
at
once
resolved
to
punish
them
in
his
own
case
for
such
a
marked
slight
he
set
out
secretly
with
his
braves
laid
an
ambuscade
near
famine
cove
for
the
approaching
deputation
of
iroquois
murdered
several
and
made
the
others
his
prisoners
having
done
so
he
secretly
gloried
in
the
act
afterward
saying
that
he
had
killed
the
peace
yet
in
dealing
with
the
captives
he
put
another
and
a
deceptive
face
on
the
matter
for
on
courteously
questioning
them
as
to
the
object
of
their
journey
being
told
that
they
were
peaceful
envoys
he
affected
great
wonder
seeing
that
it
was
denonville
himself
who
had
sent
him
on
purpose
to
waylay
them
to
give
seeming
corroboration
to
his
astounding
assertions
he
set
the
survivors
at
liberty
retaining
one
only
to
replace
one
of
his
men
who
was
killed
by
the
iroquois
in
resisting
the
hurons
attack
leaving
the
deputies
to
follow
what
course
they
thought
fit
he
hastened
with
his
men
to
michilimackinac
where
he
presented
his
prisoner
to
durantaye
who
not
as
yet
officially
informed
perhaps
that
a
truce
existed
with
the
iroquois
consigned
him
to
death
though
he
gave
durantaye
assurance
of
who
he
really
was
but
when
the
victim
appealed
to
the
rat
for
confirmation
of
his
being
an
accredited
envoy
that
unscrupulous
personage
told
him
he
must
be
out
of
his
mind
to
imagine
such
a
thing
this
human
sacrifice
offered
up
the
rat
called
upon
an
aged
iroquois
then
and
long
previously

of

when

was
about
to

out
a
special
messenger
arrived

by

successor

enjoining
the
chiefs
of
the
iroquois
confederation
not
to
treat
with

the
participation
of
his
master

announcing
at

that
the
king
of
great
britain
had
taken
the
iroquois
nations
under
his
protection
concurrently
with
this
step
andros
wrote
to
denonville
that
the
iroquois
territory
was
a
dependency
holden
of
the
british
and
that
he
would
not
permit
its
people
to
treat

conditions

proposed

whether
instructions
sent
from

warranted

polity
pursued
by

or
not
his
injunctions
had
the
effect
of
instantly
stopping
the
negotiations
with
the
iroquois
and
prompting
them
to
recommence
their
vengeful
hostilities

existence
of

but
worse
evils
were
in
store
for
the
latter
days
of
the
denonville
administration
a
period
which
take
it
altogether
was
one
of
the
most
calamitous
which
our
forefathers
passed
through
at
the
time
we
have
now
reached
in
this
history
an
unexpected
as
well
as
unwonted
calm
pervaded
the
country
yet
the
governor
had
been
positively
informed
that
a
desolating
inroad
by
the
collective
iroquois
had
been
arranged
and
that
its
advent
was
imminent
but
as
no
precursive
signs
of
it
appeared
anywhere
to
the
general
eyes
it
was
hoped
that
the
storm
said
to
be
ready
to
burst
might
yet
be
evaded
none
being
able
to
account
for
the
seeming
inaction
of
the
iroquois
the
governor
applied
to
the
jesuits
for
their
opinion
on
the
subject
the
latter
expressed
their
belief
that
those
who
had
brought
intelligence
of
the
evil
intention
of
the
confederacy
had
been
misinformed
as
to
facts
or
else
exaggerated
sinister
probabilities
the
prevailing
calm
was
therefore
dangerous
as
well
as
deceitful
for
it
tended
to
slacken
preparations
which
ought
to
have
been
made
to
lessen
the
apprehensions
of
coming
events
which
threw
no
shadow
before
the
winter
and
the
spring
of
the
year
had
been
passed
in
an
unusually
tranquil
manner
and
the
summer
was
pretty
well
advanced
when
the
storm
long
pent
up
suddenly
fell
on

beautiful
island
of

during

night

silently
on

to

by

thus
dealt

up

against
the
murderers
of

countrymen

sent
them
back

forbade
them
to
stir

opportunities
presented
themselves
for
disposing
of
parties
of
the
barbarians
when
reckless
from
drink
after
their
orgies
or
when
roving
about
in
scattered
parties
feeble
in
number
but
the
positive
orders
to
refrain
from
attacking
them
withheld
the
uplifted
hand
from
striking
in
face
of
a
prohibition
so
authoritative
the
soldiers
and
the
inhabitants
alike
could
only
look
on
and
wait
till
the
savages
should
find
it
convenient
to
retire
some
small
skirmishing

there
was
at
a
few
distant
points
between
the
people
and

their

roasted
at
a

fire

assembled

the
resistance
to

being
little

none
in

overran

most
of
the
inhabitants

met
in
their
passage

their
course
was
marked

they
went

lines
of
flame
their
bands
moved
rapidly
from
one
devoted
tract
to
another
yet
wherever
they
had
to
face
concerted
resistance
which
in
some
cases
at
least
put
a
fitting
obstacle
in
the
way
of
their
intended
ravagings
they
turned
aside
and
sought
an
easier
prey
elsewhere
in
brief
during
ten
entire
weeks
or
more
did
they
wreak
their
wrath
almost
unchecked
upon
the
fairest
region
of
canada

did
not
retire
thence
till
about

coolly
received
their
fire

returning
the
discharge
each
singled
out
his
man

eighteen
of

the

difficult
to
account
for
their
total
unpreparedness

imputing
serious
blame
to
denonville
and
his
subalterns
in
office
that
he
exercised
no
proper
influence

the
first
place
was
evident
and
the
small
use
he
made
of
the
means
he
had
at
his
disposal
when
the
crisis
arrived
was
really
something
to
marvel
at
he
was
plainly
unequal
to
the
occasion
and
his
incapacity
in
every
particular
made
it
quite
impossible
for
his
presence
as
chief
of
the
colony
to
be
endured
any
longer
there
is
little
doubt
that
had
he
not
been

the

importance

account

which

to
find

gates
against

regiment
commanded

together
with
an
account
of

danger
they
incurred
by
such
a
vigorous
measure

implored
immediate
assistance
they
were
accordingly
supplied
with
some
arms
and
ammunition
but
did
not
receive
any
considerable
reënforcement
till
the
middle
of

when

regiments
arrived

under

retreated

it
would
be
imprudent
to
land
the
two
regiments
and
that
the
principal
officers
should
withdraw
themselves
from

inhabitants
of
which
would
obtain

more
favorable
capitulation

officer
was

despatched
to

james
with
proposals

agreed
that

distance

miles
from

notwithstanding
this
preliminary
james
advanced
at
the
head
of
his
troops
but
met
with
such
a
warm
reception
from
the
besieged
that
he
was
fain
to
retire
to
john
town
in
some
disorder
the
inhabitants
and
soldiers
in
garrison
at
londonderry
were
so
incensed
at
the
members
of
the
council
of
war
who
had
resolved
to
abandon
the
place
that
they
threatened
immediate
vengeance
cunningham
and
richards
retired
to
their
ships
and
lundy
locked
himself
in
his
chamber
in
vain
did
walker
and
major
baker
exhort
him
to
maintain
his
government
such
was
his
cowardice
or
treachery
that
he
absolutely
refused
to
be
concerned
in
the
defence
of
the
place
and
he
was
suffered
to
escape
in
disguise
with
a
load
of
matches
on
his
back
but
he
was
afterward
apprehended
in
scotland
from
whence
he
was
sent
to
london
to
answer
for
his
perfidy
or
misconduct
after
his
retreat
the
townsmen
chose
walker
and
major
baker
for
their
governors
with
joint
authority
but
this
office
they
would
not
undertake
until
it
had
been
offered
to
colonel
cunningham
as
the
officer
next
in
command
to
lundy
he
rejected
the
proposal
and
with
richards
returned
to

where
they
were
immediately
cashiered
the
two
new
governors
thus
abandoned
to
their
fate
began
to
prepare
for
a
vigorous
defence
indeed
their
courage
seems
to
have
transcended
the
bounds
of
discretion
for
the
place
was
very
their
cannon
which
did
not
exceed
twenty
pieces
were
wretchedly
mounted
they
had
not
one
engineer
to
direct
their
operations
they
had
a
very
small
number
of
horse
the
garrison
consisted
of
people
unacquainted
with
military
discipline
they
were
destitute
of
provisions
they
were
besieged
by
a
king
in
person
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
army
directed
by
good
officers
and
supplied
with
all
the
necessary
implements
for
a
siege
or
battle
the
town
was
invested
on
april
the
batteries
were
soon
opened
and
several
attacks
were
made
with
great
impetuosity
but
the
besiegers
were
always
repulsed
with
considerable
loss
the
townsmen
gained
divers
advantages
in
repeated
sallies
and
would
have
held
their
enemies
in
the
utmost
contempt
had
they
not
been
afflicted
with
a
contagious
distemper
as
well
as
reduced
to
extremity
by
want
of
provisions
they
were
even
tantalized
in
their
distress
for
they
had
the
mortification
to
see
some
ships
which
had
arrived
with
supplies
from
england
prevented
from
sailing
up
the
river
by
the
batteries
the
enemy
had
raised
on
both
sides
and
a
boom
with
which
they
had
blocked
up
the
channel
at
length
a
reënforcement
arrived
in
the
lough
under
the
command
of
general
kirke
who
had
deserted
his
master
and
been
employed
in
the
service
of
king
william
he
found
means
to
convey
intelligence
to
walker
that
he
had
troops
and
provisions
on
board
for
their
relief
but
found
it
impracticable
to
sail
up
the
river
he
promised
however
that
he
would
land
a
body
of
forces
at
the
inch
and
endeavor
to
make
a
diversion
in
their
favor
when
joined
by
the
troops
at
inniskillen
which
amounted
to
five
thousand
men
including
two
thousand
cavalry
he
said
he
expected
six
thousand
men
from
england
where
they
were
embarked
before
he
set
sail
he
exhorted
them
to
persevere
in
their
courage
and
loyalty
and
assured
them
that
he
would
come
to
their
relief
at
all
hazards
the
assurances
enabled
them
to
bear
their
miseries
a
little
longer
though
their
numbers
daily
diminished
major
baker
dying
his
place
was
filled
by
colonel
michelburn
who
now
acted
as
colleague
to
walker
king
james
having
returned
to
dublin
to
be
present
at
the
parliament
the
command
of
his
army
devolved
to
the
french
general
rosene
who
was
exasperated
by
such
an
obstinate
opposition
by
a
handful
of
militia
he
threatened
to
raze
the
town
to
its
foundations
and
destroy
the
inhabitants
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
unless
they
would
immediately
submit
themselves
to
their
lawful
sovereign
the
governors
treated
his
menaces
with
contempt
and
published
an
order
that
no
person
on
pain
of
death
should
talk
of
surrendering
they
had
now
consumed
the
last
remains
of
their
provisions
and
supported
life
by
eating
the
flesh
of
horses
dogs
cats
rats
mice
and
tallow
starch
and
salted
hides
and
even
this
loathsome
food
began
to
fail
rosene
finding
them
deaf
to
all
his
proposals
threatened
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
all
the
protestants
of
that
county
and
drive
them
under
the
walls
of
londonderry
where
they
should
be
suffered
to
perish
by
famine
the
bishop
of
meath
being
informed
of
this
design
complained
to
king
james
of
the
barbarous
intention
entreating
his
majesty
to
prevent
its
being
put
into
execution
that
prince
assured
him
that
he
had
already
ordered
rosene
to
desist
from
such
proceedings
nevertheless
the
frenchman
executed
his
threats
with
the
utmost
rigor
footnote
james
was
assisted
in
his
attempt
by
a
small
body
of
french
troops
england
having
entered
the
grand
alliance
against
louis
ed
parties
of
dragoons
were
detached
on
this
cruel
service
after
having
stripped
all
the
protestants
for
thirty
miles
round
they
drove
these
unhappy
people
before
them
like
cattle
without
even
sparing
the
enfeebled
old
men
nurses
with
infants
at
their
breasts
and
tender
children
about
four
thousand
of
these
miserable
objects
were
driven
under
the
walls
of
londonderry
this
expedient
far
from
answering
the
purpose
of
rosene
produced
a
quite
contrary
effect
the
besieged
were
so
exasperated
at
this
act
of
inhumanity
that
they
resolved
to
perish
rather
than
submit
to
such
a
barbarian
they
erected
a
gibbet
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
sent
a
message
to
the
french
general
importing
that
they
would
hang
all
the
prisoners
they
had
taken
during
the
siege
unless
the
protestants
whom
they
had
driven
under
the
walls
should
be
immediately
dismissed
this
threat
produced
a
negotiation
in
consequence
of
which
the
protestants
were
released
after
they
had
been
detained
three
days
without
tasting
food
some
hundreds
died
of
famine
or
fatigue
and
those
who
lived
to
return
to
their
own
habitations
found
them
plundered
and
sacked
by
the
papists
so
that
the
greater
number
perished
for
want
or
were
murdered
by
straggling
parties
of
the
enemy
yet
these
very
people
had
for
the
most
part
obtained
protection
from
king
james
to
which
no
respect
was
paid
by
his
general
the
garrison
of
londonderry
was
now
reduced
from
seven
thousand
to
five
thousand
seven
hundred
men
and
these
were
driven
to
such
extremity
of
distress
that
they
began
to
talk
of
killing
the
popish
inhabitants
and
feeding
on
their
bodies
kirke
who
had
hitherto
lain
inactive
ordered
two
ships
laden
with
provisions
to
sail
up
the
river
under
convoy
of
the
dartmouth
frigate
one
of
these
called
the
mountjoy
broke
the
boom
and
all
the
three
after
having
sustained
a
very
hot
fire
from
both
sides
of
the
river
arrived
in
safety
at
the
town
to
the
inexpressible
joy
of
the
inhabitants
the
army
of
james
was
so
dispirited
by
the
success
of
this
enterprise
that
they
abandoned
the
siege
in
the
night
and
retired
with
precipitation
after
having
lost
about
nine
thousand
men
before
the
place
kirke
no
sooner
took
possession
of
the
town
than
walker
was
prevailed
upon
to
embark
for
england
with
an
address
of
thanks
from
the
inhabitants
to
their
majesties
for
the
seasonable
relief
they
had
received
king
james
trusted
so
much
to
the
disputes
in
the
english
parliament
that
he
did
not
believe
his
would
be
able
to
quit
that
kingdom
and
william
had
been
six
days
in
ireland
before
he
received
intimation
of
his
arrival
this
was
no
sooner
known
than
he
left
dublin
under
the
guard
of
the
militia
commanded
by
luttrel
and
with
a
reënforcement
of
six
thousand
infantry
which
he
had
lately
received
from
france
joined
the
rest
of
his
forces
which
now
almost
equalled
william
army
in
number
exclusive
of
about
fifteen
thousand
men
who
remained
in
different
garrisons
he
occupied
a
very
advantageous
post
on
the
bank
of
the
boyne
and
contrary
to
the
advice
of
his
general
officers
resolved
to
stand
battle
they
proposed
to
strengthen
their
garrisons
and
retire
to
the
shannon
to
wait
the
effect
of
the
operations
at
sea
louis
had
promised
to
equip
a
powerful
armament
against
the
english
fleet
and
send
over
a
great
number
of
small
frigates
to
destroy
transports
as
soon
as
their
convoy
should
be
returned
to
england
the
execution
of
this
scheme
was
not
at
all
difficult
and
must
have
proved
fatal
to
the
english
army
for
their
stores
and
ammunition
were
still
on
board
the
ships
sailed
along
the
coast
as
the
troops
advanced
in
their
march
and
there
was
not
one
secure
harbor
into
which
they
could
retire
on
any
emergency
james
however
was
bent
on
hazarding
an
engagement
and
expressed
uncommon
confidence
and
alacrity
besides
the
river
which
was
deep
his
front
was
secured
by
a
morass
and
a
rising
ground
so
that
the
english
army
could
not
attack
him
without
manifest
disadvantage
king
william
marched
up
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
as
he
reconnoitred
their
situation
was
exposed
to
the
fire
of
some
which
the
enemy
purposely
planted
against
his
person
they
killed
a
man
and
two
horses
close
by
him
and
the
second
bullet
rebounding
from
the
earth
grazed
on
his
right
shoulder
so
as
to
carry
off
part
of
his
clothes
and
skin
and
produce
a
considerable
contusion
this
accident
which
he
bore
without
the
least
emotion
created
some
confusion
among
his
attendants
which
the
enemy
perceiving
concluded
he
was
killed
and
shouted
aloud
in
token
of
their
joy
the
whole
camp
resounded
with
acclamation
and
several
squadrons
of
their
horse
were
drawn
down
toward
the
river
as
if
they
intended
to
pass
it
immediately
and
attack
the
english
army
the
report
was
instantly
communicated
from
place
to
place
until
it
reached
dublin
from
thence
it
was
conveyed
to
paris
where
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
french
court
the
people
were
encouraged
to
celebrate
the
event
with
bonfires
and
illuminations
william
rode
along
the
line
to
show
himself
to
the
army
after
this
narrow
escape
at
night
he
called
a
council
of
war
and
declared
his
resolution
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
morning
schomberg
at
first
opposed
his
design
but
finding
the
king
determined
he
advised
that
a
strong
detachment
of
horse
and
foot
should
that
night
pass
the
boyne
at
slane
bridge
and
take
post
between
the
enemy
and
the
pass
at
duleck
that
the
action
might
be
the
more
decisive
this
counsel
being
rejected
the
king
determined
that
early
in
the
morning
douglas
with
the
right
wing
of
the
infantry
and
young
schomberg
with
the
horse
should
pass
at
slane
bridge
while
the
main
body
of
the
foot
should
force
their
passage
at
old
bridge
and
the
left
at
certain
fords
between
the
enemy
camp
and
drogheda
the
duke
perceiving
that
his
advice
was
not
relished
by
the
dutch
generals
retired
to
his
tent
where
the
order
of
battle
being
brought
to
him
he
received
it
with
an
air
of
discontent
saying
it
was
the
first
that
had
ever
been
sent
to
him
in
that
manner
the
proper
dispositions
being
made
william
rode
quite
through
the
army
by
torchlight
and
then
retired
to
his
tent
after
having
given
orders
to
his
soldiers
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
enemy
by
wearing
green
boughs
in
their
hats
during
the
action

ed
at
six
in
the
morning
general
douglas
with
young
schomberg
the
earl
of
portland
and
auverquerque
marched
to
slane
bridge
and
passed
the
river
with
very
little
opposition
when
they
reached
the
farther
bank
they
perceived
the
enemy
drawn
up
in
two
lines
to
a
considerable
number
of
horse
and
foot
with
a
morass
in
their
front
so
that
douglas
was
obliged
to
wait
for
reinforcements
this
being
arrived
the
infantry
was
led
on
to
the
charge
through
the
morass
while
count
schomberg
rode
round
it
with
his
cavalry
to
attack
the
enemy
in
flank
the
irish
instead

waiting
the
assault
faced
about
and
retreated

precipitation

fast

fell
in
among

king
james
however
soon
reënforced
his
left
wing
from
the
centre
and
the
count
was
in
his
turn
obliged
to
send
for
assistance
at
this
juncture
king
william
main
body
consisting
of
the
dutch
guards
the
french
regiments
and
some
battalions
of
english
passed
the
river
which
was
under
a
general
discharge
of
artillery
king
james
had
imprudently
removed
his
cannon
from
the
other
side
but
he
had
posted
a
strong
body
of
musketeers
along
the
bank
behind
hedges
houses
and
some
works
raised
for
the
occasion
these
poured
in
a
close
fire
on
the
english
troops
before
they
reached
the
shore
but
it
produced
very
little
effect
then
the
irish
gave
way
and
some
battalions
landed
without
further
opposition
yet
before
they
could
form
they
were
charged
with
great
impetuosity
by
a
squadron
of
the
enemy
horse
and
a
considerable
body

advanced
from

hillocks
to
attack
those

as
well
as
to
prevent
the
rest
from
reaching
the
shore
his
infantry
turned
their
backs
and
fled
immediately
but
the
horse
charged
with
incredible
fury
both
on
the
bank
and
in
the
river
so
as
to
put
the
unformed
regiments
in
confusion

the

passed
the

at

from

which
had
broken
through

of
the
regiments

were
now
on

were
mistaken
for

allowed
to
gallop
up
to

received
two
severe
wounds
in
the
head

now
sensible

rashly
threw
in

engaged
with

saving
shot
him
dead

the
death
of

wellnigh
proved
fatal
to
the
english

was
immediately
involved
in
tumult

disorder
while
the
infantry
of

james
rallied
and
returned
to
their
posts

a
face

resolution
they
were
just

having
passed
with
the
left
wing
composed
of
the
danish
dutch

horse
advanced
to
attack
them
on

right
they
were
struck
with
such
a
panic
at
his
appearance
that
they
made
a
sudden
halt
and
then
facing
about
retreated
to
the
village
of
dunmore
there
they
made
such
a
vigorous
stand
that
the
dutch
and
danish
horse
though
headed
by
the
king
in
person
recoiled
even
the
inniskillens
gave
way

dismounted
and
lined
the

the
fugitives
were
driven

they
did
such
execution
on

checked

ardor
the

were
broken
had
now
time
to
rally

hamilton
who
had
been
the
life

of
the

during
the
whole
engagement
was
wounded
and
taken
an
incident
which
discouraged
them
to
such
a
degree
that
they
made
no
further
efforts
to
retrieve
the
advantage
they
had
lost
he
was
immediately
brought
to

your

took
no

notice
of

acted
contrary
to
his
engagement
when
he
was
permitted
to
go
to
ireland
on
promise
of
persuading
tyrconnel
to
submit
to
the

government
the
irish
now
abandoned
the
field
with
precipitation
but
the
french
and
swiss
troops
that
acted
as
their
auxiliaries
under
de
lauzun
retreated
in
good
order
after
having
maintained
the
battle
for
some
time
with
intrepidity
and
perseverance
as
king
william
did
not
think
proper
to
pursue
the
enemy
the
carnage
was
not
great
the
irish
lost
a
thousand
five
hundred
men
and
the
english
about
of
that
number
though
the
victory
was
dearly
purchased
considering
the
death
of
the
gallant
duke
of
schomberg
who
fell
in
the
year
of
his
age
after
having
rivalled
the
best
generals
of
that
time
in
military
reputation
he
was
the
descendant
of
a
noble
family
in
the
palatinate
and
his
mother
was
an
englishwoman
daughter
of
lord
dudley
being
obliged
to
leave
his
country
on
account
of
the
troubles
by
which
it
was
agitated
he
commenced
a
soldier
of
fortune
and
served
successively
in
the
armies
of
holland
england
france
portugal
and
brandenburg
he
attained
to
the
dignity
of
mareschal
in

was
courteous
and
humble
in
his
deportment
cool
penetrating
resolute
and
sagacious
nor
was
his
probity
inferior
to
his
courage
this
battle
also
proved
fatal
to
the
barve
caillemote
who
had
followed
the
duke
fortunes
and
commanded
one
of
the
protestant
regiments
after
having
received
a
mortal
wound
he
was
carried
back
through
the
river
by
four
soldiers
and
though
almost
in
the
agonies
of
death
he
with
a
cheerful
countenance
encouraged
those
who
were

to
do
their

the
third
remarkable
person
who
lost
his
life
on
this
occasion
was
walker
the
clergyman
who
had
so
valiantly
defended
londonderry
against
the
whole
army
of
king
james
he
had
been
very
graciously
received
by
king
william
who
gratified
him
with
a
reward
of
five
thousand
pounds
and
a
promise
of
further
favor
but
his
military
genius
still
predominating
he
attended
his
royal
patron
in
this
battle
and
being
shot
died
in
a
few
minutes
the
persons
of
distinction
who
fell
on
the

side

the
lords
dongan

aloof
during

with
some
squadrons
of
horse
and
seeing
victory
declare
against
him
retired
to
dublin
without
having
made
the
least
effort
to
reassemble
his
broken
forces
had
he
possessed
either
spirit
or
conduct
his
army
might
have
been
rallied

from

be
in
a
condition
to
keep
the
field
and
even
to
act
on
the
offensive
for
his
loss
was
inconsiderable
and
the
victor
did
not
attempt
to
molest
his
troops
in
their
retreat
an
omission
which
has
been
charged
to
him
as
a
flagrant
instance
of
misconduct

a
firm
believer
in

he
professed
indeed
to
be
an
adept
in
the
art
of
detecting
witches
an
art
which
became
the
subject
of
several
learned
treatises
one
of
them
from
james
own
royal
pen
during
the
commonwealth
england
had
abounded
with
professional
who
travelled
from
county
to
county
and
occasioned
the
death
of
many
unfortunate
persons
the
fundamentals
of
massachusetts
contained
a
capital
law
against
witchcraft
fortified
by
that
express
declaration
of
scripture
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
yet
among
other
evidences
of
departure
from
ancient
landmarks
and
of
the
propagation
even
to
new
england
of
a
spirit
of
doubt
were
growing
suspicions
as
to
the
reality
of
that
everyday
supernaturalism
which
formed
so
prominent
a
feature
of
the
puritan
theology
the
zeal
of
increase
mather
against
this
rising
incredulity
had
engaged
him
while
the
old
charter
was
still
in
existence
to
publish
a
book
of
in
which
were
enumerated
among
other
things
all
the
supposed
cases
of
witchcraft
which
had
hitherto
occurred
in
new
england
with
arguments
to
prove
their
reality
what
at
that
time
had
given
the
matter
additional
interest
was
the
case
of
a
bewitched
or
haunted
house
at
newbury
an
intelligent
neighbor
who
had
suggested
that
a
mischievous
grandson
of
the
occupant
might
perhaps
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
was
himself
accused
of
witchcraft
and
narrowly
escaped
a
witch
however
the
credulous
townspeople
were
resolved
to
find
and
they
presently
fixed
upon
the
wife
of
the
occupant
as
the
culprit
seventeen
persons
testified
to
mishaps
experienced
in
the
course
of
their
lives
which
they
charitably
chose
to
ascribe
to
the
and
diabolical
practices
of
this
unfortunate
old
woman
on
this
evidence
she
was
found
guilty
by
the
jury
but
the
magistrates
more
enlightened
declined
to
order
her
execution
the
deputies
thereupon
raised
a
loud
complaint
at
this
delay
of
justice
but
the
firmness
of
governor
bradstreet
supported
as
he
was
by
the
moderate
party
and
the
abrogation
of
the
charter
which
speedily
followed
saved
the
woman
life
this
same
struggle
of
opinion
existed
also
in
the
where
the
rising
sect
of
freethinkers
began
to
deny
and
deride
all
diabolical
agencies
nor
was
this
view
confined
to
professed
freethinkers
the
latitudinarian
party
in
the
church
a
rapidly
growing
body
leaned
perceptibly
the
same
way
the
serious
ministers
on
the
other
hand
led
by
richard
baxter
their
acknowledged
head
defended
with
zeal
the
reality
of
witchcraft
and
the
personality
and
agency
of
the
devil
to
deny
which
they
denounced
as
little
short
of
atheism
they
supported
their
opinions
by
the
authority
of
sir
matthew
hale
lord
chief
justice
of
england
as
distinguished
for
piety
as
for
knowledge
of
the
law
under
whose
instructions
two
alleged
witches
at
whose
trials
he
had
presided
shortly
after
the
restoration
had
been
found
guilty
and
executed
the
accounts
of
those
trials
published
in
england
on
occasion
of
this
controversy
and
republished
at
boston
had
tended
to
confirm
the
popular
belief
the
doubts
by
which
mather
had
been
alarmed
were
yet
confined
to
a
few
thinking
men
read
with
a
forward
and
zealous
faith
these
stories
did
not
fail
to
make
a
deep
impression
on
the
popular
imagination
while
andros
was
still
governor
shortly
after
increase
mather
departure
for
england
four
young
children
members
of
a
pious
family
in
boston
the
eldest
a
girl
of
thirteen
the
youngest
a
boy
not
five
had
begun
to
behave
in
a
singular
manner
barking
like
dogs
purring
like
cats
seeming
to
become
deaf
blind
or
dumb
having
their
limbs
strangely
distorted
complaining
that
they
were
pinched
pricked
pulled
or
cut
acting
out
in
fact
the
effects
of
witchcraft
according
to
the
current
notions
of
it
and
the
descriptions
in
the
books
above
referred
to
the
terrified
father
called
in
oakes
a
zealous
leader
of
the
party
presently
sent
to
england
as
joint
agent
with
mather
who
gave
his
opinion
that
the
children
were
bewitched
the
oldest
girl
had
lately
received
a
bitter
scolding
from
an
old
irish
indented
servant
whose
daughter
she
had
accused
of
theft
this
same
old
woman
from
indications
no
doubt
given
by
the
children
was
soon
fixed
upon
as
being
the
witch
the
four
ministers
of
boston
and
another
from
charlestown
having
kept
a
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
at
the
troubled
house
the
youngest
child
was
relieved
but
the
others
more
persevering
and
more
artful
continuing
as
before
the
old
woman
was
presently
arrested
and
charged
with
bewitching
them
she
had
for
a
long
time
been
reputed
a
witch
and
she
even
seems
to
have
flattered
herself
that
she
was
one
indeed
her
answers
were
so
senseless
that
the
magistrates
referred
it
to
the
doctors
to
say
if
she
were
not
crazed
in
her
intellects
on
their
report
of
her
sanity
the
old
woman
was
tried
found
guilty
and
executed
though
increase
mather
was
absent
on
this
interesting
occasion
he
had
a
zealous
representative
in
his
son
cotton
mather
by
the
mother
side
grandson
of
the
great
cotton
a
young
minister
of
a
prodigy
of
learning
eloquence
and
piety
recently
settled
as
colleague
with
his
father
over
boston
north
church
cotton
mather
had
an
extraordinary
memory
stuffed
with
all
sorts
of
learning
his
application
was
equal
to
that
of
a
german
professor
his
lively
imagination
trained
in
the
school
of
puritan
theology
and
nourished
on
the
traditionary
legends
of
new
england
of
which
he
was
a
voracious
and
indiscriminate
collector
was
still
further
stimulated
by
fasts
vigils
prayers
and
meditations
almost
equal
to
those
of
any
catholic
saint
of
a
temperament
ambitious
and
active
he
was
inflamed
with
a
great
desire
of
doing
good
fully
conscious
of
all
his
gifts
and
not
a
little
vain
of
them
like
the
jesuit
missionaries
in
canada
his
contemporaries
he
believed
himself
to
be
often
during
his
devotional
exercises
in
direct
and
personal
communication
with
the
deity
in
every
piece
of
he
saw
a
special
answer
to
his
prayers
in
every
mortification
or
calamity
the
special
personal
malice
of
the
devil
and
his
agents
yet
both
himself
and
his
father
were
occasionally
troubled
with
temptations
to
atheism
doubts
which
they
did
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
to
diabolical
influence
the
secret
consciousness
of
these
doubts
of
their
own
was
perhaps
one
source
of
their
great
impatience
at
the
doubts
of
others
cotton
mather
had
taken
a
very
active
part
in
the
late
case
of
witchcraft
and
that
he
might
study
the
operations
of
diabolical
agency
at
his
leisure
and
thus
be
furnished
with
evidence
and
arguments
to
establish
its
reality
he
took
the
eldest
of
the
bewitched
children
home
to
his
own
house
his
eagerness
to
believe
invited
imposture
his
excessive
vanity
and
strong
prejudices
made
him
easy
game
adroit
and
artful
beyond
her
years
the
girl
fooled
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent
his
ready
pen
was
soon
furnished
with
materials
for
a
story
all
made
up
of
wonders
which
with
some
other
matters
of
the
same
sort
and
a
sermon
preached
on
the
occasion
he
presently
published
under
the
title
of
providences
relating
to
witchcrafts
and
with
a
preface
in
which
he
warned
all
sadducees
that
he
should
regard
their
doubts
for
the
future
as
a
personal
insult
cotton
mather
was
not
the
only
dupe
the
old
heresy
of
the
sensual
sadducees
denying
the
being
of
angels
either
good
or
evil
says
the
recommendatory
preface
to
this
book
signed
by
the
other
four
ministers
of
boston
died
not
with
them
nor
will
it
whilst
men
abandoning
both
faith
and
reason
count
it
their
wisdom
to
credit
nothing
but
what
they
see
or
feel
how
much
this
fond
opinion
hath
gotten
ground
in
this
debauched
age
is
awfully
observable
and
what
a
dangerous
stroke
it
gives
to
settle
men
in
atheism
is
not
hard
to
discern
god
is
therefore
pleased
besides
the
witness
borne
to
this
truth
in
sacred
writ
to
suffer
devils
sometimes
to
do
such
things
in
the
world
as
shall
stop
the
mouths
of
gainsayers
and
extort
a
confession
from
them
they
add
their
testimony
to
the
truth
of
mather
statements
which
they
commend
as
furnishing
clear
information
that
there
is
both
a
god
and
a
devil
and
witchcraft
the
book
was
presently
republished
in
london
with
a
preface
by
baxter
who
pronounced
the
girl
case
so
convincing
that
he
must
be
a
very
obdurate
sadducee
who
would
not
believe
it
mather
sermon
prefixed
to
this
narrative
is
a
curious
specimen
of
fanatical
declamation
witchcraft
he
exclaims
is
a
renouncing
of
god
and
the
advancement
of
a
filthy
devil
into
the
throne
of
the
most
high
witchcraft
is
a
renouncing
of
christ
and
preferring
the
communion
of
a
loathsome
lying
devil
before
all
the
salvation
of
the
lord
redeemer
witchcraft
is
a
siding
with
hell
against
heaven
and
earth
and
therefore
a
witch
is
not
to
be
endured
in
either
of
them
is
a
capital
crime
and
is
to
be
prosecuted
as
a
species
of
devilism
that
would
not
only
deprive
god
and
christ
of
all
his
honor
but
also
plunder
man
of
all
his
comfort
nothing
too
vile
can
be
said
of
nothing
too
hard
can
be
done
to
such
a
horrible
iniquity
as
witchcraft
is
such
declamations
from
such
a
source
giving
voice
and
authority
to
the
popular
superstition
prepared
the
way
for
the
tragedy
that
followed
the
suggestion
however
that
cotton
mather
for
purposes
of
his
own
deliberately
got
up
this
witchcraft
delusion
and
forced
it
upon
a
doubtful
and
hesitating
people
is
utterly
absurd
and
so
is
another
suggestion
a
striking
exhibition
of
partisan
extravagance
that
because
the
case
of
the
four
boston
children
happened
during
the
government
of
andros
therefore
the
responsibility
of
that
affair
rests
on
him
and
not
on
the
people
of
massachusetts
the
irish
woman
was
tried
under
a
massachusetts
law
and
convicted
by
a
massachusetts
jury
and
had
andros
interfered
to
save
her
life
to
the
other
charges
against
him
would
doubtless
have
been
added
that
of
friendship
for
witches
cotton
mather
seems
to
have
acted
in
a
degree
the
part
of
a
demagogue
yet
he
is
not
to
be
classed
with
those
tricky
and
dishonest
men
so
common
in
our
times
who
play
upon
popular
prejudices
which
they
do
not
share
in
the
expectation
of
being
elevated
to
honors
and
office
mather
position
convictions
and
temperament
alike
called
him
to
serve
on
this
occasion
as
the
organ
exponent
and
stimulator
of
the
popular
faith
the
bewitched
girl
as
she
ceased
to
be
an
object
of
popular
attention
seems
to
have
returned
to
her
former
behavior
but
the
seed
had
been
sown
on
fruitful
ground
after
an
interval
of
nearly
four
years
three
young
girls
in
the
family
of
parris
minister
of
salem
village
now
danvers
began
to
exhibit
similar
pranks
as
in
the
boston
case
a
physician
pronounced
them
bewitched
and
tituba
an
old
indian
woman
the
servant
of
parris
who
undertook
by
some
vulgar
rites
to
discover
the
witch
was
rewarded
by
the
girls
with
the
accusation
of
being
herself
the
cause
of
their
sufferings
the
neighboring
ministers
assembled
at
the
house
of
parris
for
fasting
and
prayer
the
village
fasted
and
presently
a
general
fast
was
ordered
throughout
the
colony
the
bewitched
children
thus
rendered
objects
of
universal
sympathy
and
attention
did
not
long
want
imitators
several
other
girls
and
two
or
three
women
of
the
neighborhood
began
to
be
afflicted
in
the
same
way
as
did
also
john
the
indian
husband
of
tituba
warned
it
would
seem
by
the
fate
of
his
wife
parris
took
a
very
active
part
in
discovering
the
witches
so
did
noyes
minister
of
salem
described
as
a
learned
a
charitable
and
a
good
man
a
town
committee
was
soon
formed
for
the
detection
of
the
witches
two
of
the
magistrates
resident
at
salem
entered
with
great
zeal
into
the
matter
the
accusations
confined
at
first
to
tituba
and
two
other
friendless
women
one
crazed
the
other
bedrid
presently
included
two
female
members
of
parris
church
in
which
as
in
so
many
other
churches
there
had
been
some
sharp
dissensions
the
next
sunday
after
this
accusation
parris
preached
from
the
verse
have
i
not
chosen
you
twelve
and
one
is
a
devil
at
the
announcement
of
this
text
the
sister
of
one
of
the
accused
women
rose
and
left
the
she
too
was
accused
immediately
after
and
the
same
fate
soon
overtook
all
who
showed
the
least
disposition
to
resist
the
prevailing
delusion
the
matter
had
now
assumed
so
much
importance
that
the
for
the
provisional
government
was
still
in
operation
proceeded
to
salem
village
with
five
other
magistrates
and
held
a
court
in
the
a
great
crowd
was
present
parris
acted
at
once
as
clerk
and
accuser
producing
the
witnesses
and
taking
down
the
testimony
the
accused
were
held
with
their
arms
extended
and
hands
open
lest
by
the
least
motion
of
their
fingers
they
might
inflict
torments
on
their
victims
who
sometimes
affected
to
be
struck
dumb
and
at
others
to
be
knocked
down
by
the
mere
glance
of
an
eye
they
were
haunted
they
said
by
the
spectres
of
the
accused
who
tendered
them
a
book
and
solicited
them
to
subscribe
a
league
with
the
devil
and
when
they
refused
would
bite
pinch
scratch
choke
burn
twist
prick
pull
and
otherwise
torment
them
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
accused
brought
into
court
the
afflicted
would
seem
to
be
seized
with
a
fit
of
these
torments
from
which
however
they
experienced
instant
relief
when
the
accused
were
compelled
to
touch
them
infallible
proof
to
the
minds
of
the
gaping
assembly
that
these
apparent
sufferings
were
real
and
the
accusations
true
the
theory
was
that
the
touch
conveyed
back
into
the
witch
the
malignant
humors
shot
forth
from
her
eyes
and
learned
references
were
even
made
to
descartes
of
whose
new
philosophy
some
rumors
had
reached
new
england
in
support
of
this
theory
in
the
examinations
at
salem
village
some
very
extraordinary
scenes
occurred
look
there
cried
one
of
the
afflicted
there
is
goody
procter
on
the
beam
this
goody
procter
husband
notwithstanding
the
accusation
against
her
still
took
her
side
and
had
attended
her
to
the
court
in
consequence
of
which
act
of
fidelity
some
of
the
afflicted
began
now
to
cry
out
that
he
too
was
a
wizard
at
the
exclamation
above
cited
many
if
not
all
the
bewitched
had
grievous
fits
question
by
the
court
ann
putnam
who
hurts
you
answer
goodman
procter
and
his
wife
too
then
some
of
the
afflicted
cry
out
there
is
procter
going
to
take
up
pope
feet
and
immediately
her
feet
are
taken
up
question
by
the
court
what
do
you
say
goodman
procter
to
these
things
answer
i
know
not
i
am
innocent
abigail
williams
another
of
the
afflicted
cries
out
there
is
goodman
procter
going
to
mrs
pope
and
immediately
said
pope
falls
into
a
fit
a
magistrate
to
procter
you
see
the
devil
will
deceive
you
the
children
so
all
the
afflicted
were
called
could
see
what
you
were
going
to
do
before
the
woman
was
hurt
i
would
advise
you
to
repentance
for
you
see
the
devil
is
bringing
you
out
abigail
williams
cries
out
again
there
is
goodman
procter
going
to
hurt
goody
bibber
and
immediately
goody
bibber
falls
into
a
fit
abigail
williams
and
ann
putnam
both
made
offer
to
strike
at
elizabeth
procter
but
when
abigail
hand
came
near
it
opened
whereas
it
was
made
up
into
a
fist
before
and
came
down
exceedingly
lightly
as
it
drew
near
to
said
procter
and
at
length
with
open
and
extended
fingers
touched
hood
very
lightly
and
immediately
abigail
cries
out
fingers
my
fingers
my
fingers
burn
and
ann
putnam
takes
on
most
grievously
of
her
head
and
sinks
down
such
was
the
evidence
upon
which
people
were
believed
to
be
witches
and
committed
to
prison
to
be
tried
for
their
lives
yet
let
us
not
hurry
too
much
to
triumph
over
the
past
in
these
days
of
animal
magnetism
have
we
not
ourselves
seen
imposture
as
gross
and
even
in
respectable
quarters
a
headlong
credulity
just
as
precipitate
we
must
consider
also
that
the
judgments
of
our
ancestors
were
disturbed
not
only
by
wonder
but
by
fear
encouraged
by
the
ready
belief
of
the
magistrates
and
the
public
the
afflicted
went
on
enlarging
the
circle
of
their
accusations
which
presently
seemed
to
derive
fresh
corroboration
from
the
confessions
of
some
of
the
accused
tituba
had
been
flogged
into
a
confession
others
yielded
to
a
pressure
more
stringent
than
blows
weak
women
astonished
at
the
charges
and
contortions
of
their
accusers
assured
that
they
were
witches
beyond
all
doubt
and
urged
to
confess
as
the
only
possible
chance
for
their
lives
were
easily
prevailed
upon
to
repeat
any
tales
put
into
their
mouths
their
journeys
through
the
air
on
broomsticks
to
attend
witch
sacraments
a
sort
of
travesty
on
the
christian
ordinance
at
which
the
devil
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
small
black
man
their
signing
the
devil
book
renouncing
their
former
baptism
and
being
baptized
anew
by
the
devil
who
dipped
them
in
wenham
pond
after
the
anabaptist
fashion
called
upon
to
tell
who
were
present
at
these
sacraments
the
confessing
witches
wound
up
with
new
accusations
and
by
the
time
phipps
arrived
in
the
colony
near
a
hundred
persons
were
already
in
prison
the
mischief
was
not
limited
to
salem
an
idea
had
been
taken
up
that
the
bewitched
could
explain
the
causes
of
sickness
and
one
of
them
carried
to
andover
for
that
purpose
had
accused
many
persons
of
witchcraft
and
thrown
the
whole
village
into
the
greatest
commotion
some
persons
also
had
been
accused
in
boston
and
other
towns
it
was
one
of
governor
phipps
first
official
acts
to
order
all
the
prisoners
into
irons
this
restraint
upon
their
motions
might
impede
them
it
was
hoped
in
tormenting
the
afflicted
without
waiting
for
the
meeting
of
the
general
court
to
whom
that
authority
properly
belonged
phipps
hastened
by
advice
of
his
counsel
to
organize
a
special
court
for
the
trial
of
the
witches
stoughton
the
was
appointed
president
but
his
cold
and
hard
temper
his
theological
education
and
unyielding
bigotry
were
ill
qualifications
for
such
an
office
his
associates
six
in
number
were
chiefly
boston
men
possessing
a
high
reputation
for
wisdom
and
piety
among
them
richards
the
late
agent
wait
winthrop
brother
of
winthrop
and
grandson
of
the
former
governor
and
samuel
sewell
the
two
latter
subsequently
in
turn
of
the
province
the
new
court
thus
organized
proceeded
to
salem
and
commenced
operations
by
the
trial
of
an
old
woman
who
had
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
witch
besides
spectral
evidence
that
is
the
tales
of
the
afflicted
a
jury
of
women
appointed
to
make
an
examination
found
upon
her
a
wart
or
excrescence
adjudged
to
be
a
devil
teat
a
number
of
old
stories
were
also
raked
up
of
dead
hens
and
foundered
cattle
and
carts
upset
ascribed
by
the
neighbors
to
her
incantations
on
this
evidence
she
was
brought
in
guilty
and
hanged
a
few
days
after
when
the
court
took
an
adjournment
to
the
end
of
the
month
the
first
general
court
under
the
new
charter
met
meanwhile
and
increase
mather
who
had
returned
in
company
with
phipps
gave
an
account
of
his
agency
from
a
house
not
well
pleased
with
the
loss
of
the
old
charter
he
obtained
a
reluctant
vote
of
thanks
but
he
received
no
compensation
for
four
years
expenses
which
had
pressed
very
heavily
upon
his
narrow
income
after
passing
a
temporary
act
for
continuing
in
force
all
the
old
laws
among
others
the
capital
law
against
witchcraft
an
adjournment
was
had
without
any
objection
or
even
reference
so
far
as
appears
to
the
special
court
for
the
trial
of
the
witches
which
surely
would
have
raised
a
great
outcry
had
it
been
established
for
any
unpopular
purpose
according
to
a
favorite
practice
of
the
old
government
now
put
in
use
for
the
last
time
phipps
requested
the
advice
of
the
elders
as
to
the
proceedings
against
the
witches
the
reply
drawn
up
by
the
hand
of
cotton
mather
acknowledges
with
thankfulness
the
success
which
the
merciful
god
has
given
to
the
sedulous
and
assiduous
endeavors
of
our
honorable
rulers
to
defeat
the
abominable
witchcrafts
which
have
been
committed
in
the
country
humbly
praying
that
the
discovery
of
those
mysterious
and
mischievous
wickednesses
may
be
perfected
it
advises
however
critical
and
exquisite
caution
in
relying
too
much
on
the
devil
authority
that
is
on
spectral
evidence
or
apparent
changes
wrought
in
the
afflicted
by
the
presence
of
the
accused
neither
of
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
ministers
could
be
trusted
as
infallible
proof
yet
it
was
almost
entirely
on
this
sort
of
evidence
that
all
the
subsequent
convictions
were
had
stoughton
unfortunately
had
espoused
the
opinion
certainly
a
plausible
one
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
devil
to
assume
the
appearance
of
an
innocent
man
or
for
persons
not
witches
to
be
spectrally
seen
at
meetings
and
some
of
the
confessing
witches
were
prompt
to
flatter
the
chief
justice
vanity
by
confirming
a
doctrine
so
apt
for
their
purposes
at
the
second
session
of
the
special
court
five
women
were
tried
and
convicted
the
others
were
easily
disposed
of
but
in
the
case
of
rebecca
nurse
one
of
parris
a
woman
hitherto
of
unimpeachable
character
the
jury
at
first
gave
a
verdict
of
acquittal
at
the
announcement
of
this
verdict
the
afflicted
raised
a
great
clamor
the
honored
court
called
the
jury
attention
to
an
exclamation
of
the
prisoner
during
the
trial
expressive
of
surprise
at
seeing
among
the
witnesses
two
of
her
late
why
do
these
testify
against
me
they
used
to
come
among
us
these
two
witnesses
had
turned
confessors
and
these
words
were
construed
by
the
court
as
confirming
their
testimony
of
having
met
the
prisoner
at
witches
meetings
the
unhappy
woman
partially
deaf
listened
to
this
colloquy
in
silence
thus
pressed
by
the
court
and
hearing
no
reply
from
the
prisoner
the
jury
changed
their
verdict
and
pronounced
her
guilty
the
explanations
subsequently
offered
in
her
behalf
were
disregarded
the
governor
indeed
granted
a
reprieve
but
the
salem
committee
procured
its
recall
and
the
unhappy
woman
taken
in
chains
to
the
was
solemnly
excommunicated
and
presently
hanged
with
the
others
at
the
third
session
of
the
court
six
prisoners
were
tried
and
convicted
all
of
whom
were
presently
hanged
except
elizabeth
procter
whose
pregnancy
was
pleaded
in
delay
her
true
and
faithful
husband
in
spite
of
a
letter
to
the
boston
ministers
denouncing
the
falsehood
of
the
witnesses
complaining
that
confessions
had
been
extorted
by
torture
and
begging
for
a
trial
at
boston
or
before
other
judges
was
found
guilty
and
suffered
with
the
rest
another
of
this
unfortunate
company
was
john
willard
employed
as
an
officer
to
arrest
the
accused
but
whose
imprudent
expression
of
some
doubts
on
the
subject
had
caused
him
to
be
accused
also
he
had
fled
but
was
pursued
and
taken
and
was
now
tried
and
executed
his
behavior
and
that
of
procter
at
the
place
of
execution
made
however
a
deep
impression
on
many
minds
a
still
more
remarkable
case
was
that
of
george
burroughs
a
minister
whom
the
incursions
of
the
eastern
indians
had
lately
driven
from
saco
back
to
salem
village
where
he
had
formerly
preached
and
where
he
now
found
among
his
former
parishioners
enemies
more
implacable
even
than
the
indians
it
was
the
misfortune
of
burroughs
to
have
many
enemies
in
part
perhaps
by
his
own
fault
encouragement
was
thus
found
to
accuse
him
some
of
the
witnesses
had
seen
him
at
witches
meetings
others
had
seen
the
apparitions
of
his
dead
wives
which
accused
him
of
cruelty
these
witnesses
with
great
symptoms
of
horror
and
alarm
even
pretended
to
see
these
dead
wives
again
appearing
to
them
in
open
court
though
small
of
size
burroughs
was
remarkably
strong
instances
of
which
were
given
in
proof
that
the
devil
helped
him
stoughton
treated
him
with
cruel
insolence
and
did
his
best
to
confuse
and
confound
him
what
insured
his
condemnation
was
a
paper
he
handed
to
the
jury
an
extract
from
some
author
denying
the
possibility
of
witchcraft
burroughs
speech
from
the
gallows
affected
many
especially
the
fluent
fervency
of
his
prayers
concluding
with
the
lord
prayer
which
no
witch
it
was
thought
could
repeat
correctly
several
indeed
had
been
already
detected
by
some
slight
error
or
mispronunciation
in
attempting
it
the
impression
however
which
burroughs
might
have
produced
was
neutralized
by
cotton
mather
who
appeared
on
horseback
among
the
crowd
and
took
occasion
to
remind
the
people
that
burroughs
though
a
preacher
was
no
ordained
minister
and
that
the
devil
would
sometimes
assume
even
the
garb
of
an
angel
of
light
at
a
fourth
session
of
the
court
six
women
were
tried
and
found
guilty
at
another
session
shortly
after
eight
women
and
one
man
were
convicted
all
of
whom
received
sentence
of
death
an
old
man
of
eighty
who
refused
to
plead
was
pressed
to
death
a
barbarous
infliction
prescribed
by
the
common
law
for
such
cases
ever
since
the
trials
began
it
had
been
evident
that
confession
was
the
only
avenue
to
safety
several
of
those
now
found
guilty
confessed
and
were
reprieved
but
samuel
woodwell
having
retracted
his
confession
along
with
seven
others
who
persisted
in
their
innocence
was
sent
to
execution
the
afflicted
numbered
by
this
time
about
fifty
had
confessed
themselves
witches
and
turned
accusers
twenty
persons
had
already
suffered
death
eight
more
were
under
sentence
the
jails
were
full
of
prisoners
and
new
accusations
were
added
every
day
such
was
the
state
of
things
when
the
court
adjourned
to
the
first
monday
in
november
cotton
mather
employed
this
interval
in
preparing
his
of
the
invisible
containing
an
exulting
account
of
the
late
trials
giving
full
credit
to
the
statements
of
the
afflicted
and
the
confessors
and
vaunting
the
good
effects
of
the
late
executions
in
the
strange
deliverance
of
some
that
had
lain
for
many
years
in
a
most
sad
condition
under
they
knew
not
what
evil
hand
while
the
witch
trials
were
going
on
the
governor
had
hastened
to
pemaquid
and
in
accordance
with
instructions
brought
with
him
from
england
though
at
an
expense
to
the
province
which
caused
loud
complaints
had
built
there
a
strong
stone
fort
colonel
church
had
been
employed
in
the
mean
time
with
four
hundred
men
in
scouring
the
shores
of
the
penobscot
and
the
banks
of
the
kennebec
notwithstanding
some
slight
cautions
about
trusting
too
much
to
spectral
evidence
mather
book
which
professed
to
be
published
at
the
special
request
of
the
governor
was
evidently
intended
to
stimulate
to
further
proceedings
but
before
its
publication
the
reign
of
terror
had
already
reached
such
a
height
as
to
commence
working

even
the
generation
of

in
danger
one
of
the

had
been
implicated
but
two
of
the
confessing

came
to
his
rescue
by
declaring
that
they
had
surreptitiously
carried
his
shape
to
a
witches
meeting
in
order
to
create
a
belief
that
he
was
there
hale
minister
of
beverly

been
very
active
against
the

when
his

after

were

of

is

began
to
throw
out

even
against

the
extraordinary

the
determination
of

to
overlook
the
most
obvious
falsehoods
and
contradictions
on
the
part
of
the
afflicted
and
the
confessors
under
pretence
that
the
devil
took
away
their
memories
and
imposed
upon
their
brain
while

reliance
was
placed
on
their
testimony
to
convict
the

the
partiality
exhibited
in
omitting
to
take
any
notice
of
certain
accusations
the
violent
means
employed
to

amounting
sometimes
to
positive
torture
the
total
disregard
of
retractions
made
voluntarily
and
even
at
the
hazard
of
life
all
these
circumstances
had
impressed
the
attention
of
the
more
rational
part
of
the
community
and
in
this
crisis
of
danger
and
alarm
the
meeting
of
the
general
court
was
most
anxiously
awaited
when
that
body
assembled
a
remonstrance
came
in
from
andover
against
the
condemnation
of
persons
of
good
fame
on
the
testimony
of
children
and
others
under
diabolical
influences
what
action
was
taken
on
this
remonstrance
does
not
appear
the
court
was
chiefly
occupied
in
the
passage
of
a
number
of
acts
embodying
some
of
the
chief
points
of
the
old
civil
and
criminal
laws
of
the
colony
the
capital
punishment
of
witchcraft
was
specially
provided
for
in
the
very
terms
of
the
english
act
of
parliament
heresy
and
blasphemy
were
also
continued
as
capital
offences
by
the
organization
of
the
superior
court
under
the
charter
the
special
commission
for
the
trial
of
witches
was
superseded
but
of
this
superior
court
stoughton
was
appointed
chief
justice
and
three
of
his
four
colleagues
had
sat
with
him
in
the
special
court
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
judges
had
undergone
any
change
of
opinion
but
when
the
new
court
proceeded
to
hold
a
special
term
at
salem
for
the
continuation
of
the
witch
trials
a
decided
alteration
in
public
feeling
became
apparent
six
women
of
andover
renounced
their
confessions
and
sent
in
a
memorial
to
that
effect
of
indictments
laid
before
the
grand
jury
only
were
returned
true
bills
of
the
persons
tried
three
only
were
found
guilty
several
others
were
acquitted
the
first
instances
of
the
sort
since
the
trials
began
the
court
then
proceeded
to
charlestown
where
many
were
in
prison
on
the
same
charge
the
case
of
a
woman
who
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
had
been
reputed
a
witch
was
selected
for
trial
many
witnesses
testified
against
her
but
the
spectral
evidence
had
fallen
into
total
discredit
and
was
not
used
though
as
strong
a
case
was
made
out
as
any
at
salem
the
woman
was
acquitted
with
her
daughter
granddaughter
and
several
others
news
presently
came
of
a
reprieve
for
those
under
sentence
of
death
at
salem
at
which
stoughton
was
so
enraged
that
he
left
the
bench
exclaiming
who
it
is
that
obstructs
the
course
of
justice
i
know
not
the
lord
be
merciful
to
the
country
nor
did
he
again
take
his
seat
during
that
term
at
the
first
session
of
the
superior
court
at
boston
the
grand
jury
though
sent
out
to
reconsider
the
matter
refused
to
find
a
bill
even
against
a
confessing
witch
the
idea
was
already
prevalent
that
some
great
mistakes
had
been
committed
at
salem
the
reality
of
witchcraft
was
still
insisted
upon
as
zealously
as
ever
but
the
impression
was
strong
that
the
devil
had
used
the
afflicted
as
his
instruments
to
occasion
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
on
behalf
of
the
ministers
increase
mather
came
out
with
his
of
conscience
concerning
in
which
while
he
argued
with
great
learning
that
spectral
evidence
was
not
infallible
and
that
the
devil
might
assume
the
shape
of
an
innocent
man
he
yet
strenuously
maintained
as
sufficient
proof
confession
or
the
speaking
such
words
or
the
doing
such
things
as
none
but
such
as
have
familiarity
with
the
devil
ever
did
or
can
do
as
to
such
as
falsely
confessed
themselves
witches
and
were
hanged
in
consequence
mather
thought
that
was
no
more
than
they
deserved
king
william
veto
on
the
witchcraft
act
prevented
any
further
trials
and
presently
by
phipps
order
all
the
prisoners
were
discharged
to
a
similar
veto
massachusetts
owes
it
that
heresy
and
blasphemy
ceased
to
appear
as
capital
crimes
on
her
the
mathers
gave
still
further
proof
of
faith
unshaken
by
discovering
an
afflicted
damsel
in
boston
whom
they
visited
and
prayed
with
and
of
whose
case
cotton
mather
wrote
an
account
circulated
in
manuscript
this
damsel
however
had
the
discretion
to
accuse
nobody
the
spectres
that
beset
her
being
all
veiled
reason
and
at
last
found
an
advocate
in
robert
calef
a
citizen
of
boston
sneered
at
by
cotton
mather
as
a
weaver
who
pretended
to
be
a
merchant
and
afterward
when
he
grew
more
angry
as
a
coal
sent
from
hell
to
blacken
his
character
a
man
however
of
sound
intelligence
and
courageous
spirit
calef
wrote
an
account
also
handed
about
in
manuscript
of
what
had
been
said
and
done
during
a
visitation
of
the
mathers
to
this
afflicted
damsel
an
exposure
of
her
imposture
and
their
credulity
which
so
nettled
cotton
mather
that
he
commenced
a
prosecution
for
slander
against
calef
which
however
he
soon
saw
reason
to
drop
calef
then
addressed
a
series
of
letters
to
mather
and
the
other
boston
ministers
in
which
he
denied
and
ridiculed
the
reality
of
any
such
compacts
with
the
devil
as
were
commonly
believed
in
under
the
name
of
witchcraft
the
witchcraft
spoken
of
in
the
bible
meant
no
more
he
maintained
than
hatred
or
opposition
to
the
word
and
worship
of
god
and
seeking
to
seduce
therefrom
by
some
sign
a
definition
which
he
had
found
in
some
english
writer
on
the
subject
and
which
he
fortified
by
divers
texts
it
was
perhaps
to
furnish
materials
for
a
reply
to
calef
that
a
circular
from
harvard
college
signed
by
increase
mather
as
president
and
by
all
the
neighboring
ministers
as
fellows
invited
reports
of
apparitions
possessions
enchantments
and
all
extraordinary
things
wherein
the
existence
and
agency
of
the
invisible
world
is
more
sensibly
demonstrated
to
be
used
as
some
fit
assembly
of
ministers
might
direct
but
the
invisible
world
was
fast
ceasing
to
be
visible
and
cotton
mather
laments
that
in
ten
years
scarce
five
returns
were
received
to
this
circular
yet
the
idea
of
some
supernatural
visitation
at
salem
was
but
very
slowly
relinquished
being
still
persisted
in
even
by
those
penitent
actors
in
the
scene
who
confessed
and
lamented
their
own
delusion
and
such
were
sewell
one
of
the
judges
noyes
one
of
the
most
active
prosecutors
and
several
of
the
jurymen
who
had
sat
on
the
trials
the
witnesses
upon
whose
testimony
so
many
innocent
persons
had
suffered
were
never
called
to
any
account
when
calef
letters
were
presently
published
in
london
together
with
his
account
of
the
supposed
witchcraft
the
book
was
burned
in
the
college
yard
at
cambridge
by
order
of
increase

the
members
of
the
boston
north
church
came
out
also
with
a
pamphlet
in
defence
of
their
pastors

of
beverly
in
his
inquiry
into
the
nature
of

though
they
admit
there
had
been
a
going
too
far
in
the
affair
at

are
yet
still
as
strenuous
as
ever
for
the
reality
of
witchcraft
nor
were
they
without
support
from
abroad
watts
then
one
of
the
chief
leaders
of
the
english
dissenters
wrote
to
cotton
mather
i
am
persuaded
there
was
much
agency
of
the
devil
in
those
affairs
and
perhaps
there
were
some
real
witches
too
twenty
years
elapsed
before
the
heirs
of
the
victims
and
those
who
had
been
obliged
to
fly
for
their
lives
obtained
some
partial
indemnity
for
their
pecuniary
losses
stoughton
and
cotton
mather
though
they
never
expressed
the
least
regret
or
contrition
for
their
part
in
the
affair
still
maintained
their
places
in
the
public
estimation
just
as
the
trials
were
concluded
stoughton
though
he
held
the
king
commission
as
was
chosen
a
counsellor
a
mark
of
confidence
which
the
theocratic
majority
did
not
choose
to
extend
to
several
of
the
moderate
party
named
in
the
original
appointment
and
to
this
post
he
was
annually
reëlected
as
long
as
he
lived
while
moody
because
he
had
favored
the
escape
of
some
of
the
accused
found
it
necessary
to
resign
his
pastorship
of
the
first
church
of
boston
and
to
return
again
to
portsmouth
yet
we
need
less
wonder
at
the
pertinacity
with
which
this
delusion
was
adhered
to
when
we
find
addison
arguing
for
the
reality
of
witchcraft
at
the
same
time
that
he
refuses
to
believe
in
any
modern
instance
of
it
and
even
blackstone
half
a
century
after
gravely
declaring
that
to
deny
the
possibility
nay
actual
existence
of
witchcraft
and
sorcery
is
at
once
flatly
to
contradict
the
revealed
word
of
god
in
various
passages
both
of
the
old
and
new
testament
establishment
of
the
bank
of
england
john
francis
not
only
did
the
establishment
of
the
bank
of
england
meet
the
demands
of
public
exigency
at
the
time
it
also
created
an
institution
which
was
to
become
vitally
important
in
the
expanding
life
of
the
nation
this
custodian
of
the
public
money
and
manager
of
the
public
debt
of
great
britain
is
now
the
largest
bank
in
the
world
the
only
other
financial
institution
that
could
show
an
equal
record
of
long
stability
was
the
bank
of
amsterdam
which
existed
from
to
the
national
debt
of
england
began
in
when
william
iii
in
order
to
carry
on
the
war
against
france
resorted
to
a
system
of
loans
this
debt
however
was
not
intended
to
be
permanent
but
when
the
bank
of
england
was
established
the
contracting
of
a
permanent
debt
began
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
england
have
been
discussed
by
many
theorists
and
financial
authorities
but
of
the
extraordinary
service
rendered
to
great
britain
by
the
scotchman
william
paterson
originator
of
the
plan
of
the
bank
of
england
there
is
no
question
although
as
francis
shows
the
project
at
first
met
with
opposition
from
many
quarters
the
important
position
assumed
by
england
toward
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
renders
the
absence
of
a
national
bank
somewhat
surprising
under
the
sagacious
government
of
cromwell
the
nation
had
increased
in
commercial
and
political
greatness
and
although
several
projects
were
issued
for
banks
one
of
which
was
to
have
branches
in
every
important
town
throughout
the
country
yet
a
necessity
for
their
formation
not
being
absolutely
felt
the
proposals
were
dismissed
during
the
protectorate
however
parliament
taking
into
consideration
the
rate
of
interest
which
was
higher
in
england
than
abroad
and
that
the
trade
was
thereby
rendered
comparatively
disadvantageous
to
the
english
merchant
reduced
the
legal
rate
from
to
per
and
this
measure
although
it
had
been
carried
by
the
parliament
of
cromwell
almost
every
act
of
which
proved
odious
in
the
eyes
of
the
stuarts
was
nevertheless
confirmed
by
the
legislature
of
charles
ii
in
the
payment
of
interest
had
been
rendered
legal
and
fixed
at
per
cent
in
the
rate
had
been
reduced
to
per
cent
and
with
the
advance
of
commercial
prosperity
it
had
been
found
advisable
to
lower
it
still
further
there
were
many
reasons
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
bank
it
was
necessary
for
the
sake
of
a
secure
paper
currency
it
was
required
for
the
support
of
the
national
credit
it
was
desirable
as
a
method
of
reducing
the
rate
of
interest
paid
by
the
state
a
rate
so
high
that
according
to
anderson
men
were
induced
to
take
their
money
out
of
trade
for
the
sake
of
securing
it
an
operation
big
with
mischief
the
truth
is
that
the
times
required
it
the
theorist
may
prove
to
demonstration
the
perfection
of
his
theory
the
speculator
may
show
the
certainty
of
its
success
but
unless
it
be
a
necessity
called
for
by
the
onward
progress
of
society
it
must
eventually
fall
to
the
ground
that
the
want
of
such
an
establishment
was
felt
is
certain
but
while
such
firms
as
childs
the
books
of
whom
go
back
to
the
year
and
refer
to
prior
documents
hoares
dating
from
and
snows
from
were
able
to
assist
the
public
demand
although
at
the
exorbitant
interest
of
the
period
it
does
not
occasion
so
much
surprise
that
the
attempt
made
to
meet
the
increasing
requirements
of
trade
proved
insufficient
in
sixteen
years
previous
to
the
foundation
of
the
bank
of
england
proposals
for
a
large
model
of
a
bank
were
published
and
in
a
national
bank
of
credit
was
brought
forward
in
a
rare
pamphlet
entitled
credit
or
the
usefullness
and
security
of
the
bank
of
credit
examined
in
a
dialogue
between
a
country
gentleman
and
a
london
this
idea
is
warmly
defended
it
was
however
simply
to
have
one
of
credit
nor
was
it
proposed
to
form
a
bank
of
deposit
although
by
the
following
remark
of
the
country
gentleman
it
is
evident
that
such
an
establishment
on
a
secure
scale
was
desirable
he
says
could
they
not
without
damage
to
themselves
have
secured
the
running
cash
of
the
nobility
gentry
merchants
and
the
traders
of
the
city
and
kingdom
from
all
hazard
which
would
have
been
a
great
benefit
to
all
concerned
who
know
not
where
to
deposit
their
cash
securely
after
much
trouble
this
bank
of
credit
was
established
at
devonshire
house
in
bishopsgate
street
its
object
as
we
have
related
being
principally
to
advance
money
to
tradesmen
and
manufacturers
on
the
security
of
goods
of
the
value
was
lent
on
these
and
bills
for
their
amount
given
to
the
depositor
in
order
to
render
them
current
an
appointed
number
of
persons
in
each
trade
was
formed
into
a
society
to
regulate
commercial
concerns
any
individual
possessed
of
such
bills
might
therefore
obtain
from
this
company
goods
or
merchandise
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
offered
current
coin
the
bank
of
credit
does
not
appear
to
have
flourished
the
machinery
was
too
complicated
and
the
risk
of
depreciation
and
the
value
of
manufactures
too
great
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
such
a
company
to
exist
after
the
bank
of
england
came
with
its
low
discount
and
free
accommodations
the
wild
spirit
of
speculation
that
spirit
which
at
various
periods
has
created
fearful
crises
in
the
commercial
world
commenced
in
the
fever
which
from
time
to
time
has
flushed
the
mind
of
the
moneyed
man
and
given
a
fierce
excitement
to
the
almost
penniless
adventurer
was
then
and
in
the
following
year
in
full
operation
the
great
south
sea
scheme
in
is
ordinarily
considered
the
earliest
display
of
this
reckless
spirit
but
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
equal
ingenuity
and
equal
villany
were
exercised
obscure
men
whose
sole
capital
was
their
enormous
impudence
invented
similar
schemes
promised
similar
advantages
and

the
capitalists
which
were
employed
with
so
much
success
at
a

period
the
want
of

great
banking
association
was
sure
to
be
made
a
pretext
two
land
banks
and
a
london
bank
to
be
managed
by
the
magistrates
with
several
other
proposals
were
therefore
put
promisingly
forward
one
of
these
was
for
another
bank
of
credit
and
a
pamphlet
published
in
under
the
title

some
idea
of
its
nature
if
a
person
desires
money
to

he

it
at

receives

form
written
upon
marble
paper
indenturewise
or
on
other
as
may
be
contrived
to
prevent
counterfeiting
it
was
also
proposed
that
the
government
should
share
the
profits
but
neither
of
the
projects
was
carried
out
the
people
neglected
their
calling
the
legitimate
desire
of

grew
into
a
fierce
and
fatal
spirit

people
amid
the
many
delusive
and
impracticable
schemes
were
two
important
projects
which
have
conferred
great
benefits
on
the
english
people
the

of
these

times

the

it
is
from
such
demands
that
our
chief
institutions
arise
by
precept
we
may
be
taught
their
propriety
by
example
we
may
see
their
advantages
but
until
the
necessity
is
personally
felt
they
are
sure
to
be
neglected
and
men
wonder
at
their
want
of
prescience
and
upbraid
their
shortsightedness
when
with
a
sudden
and
sometimes
startling
success
the
proposal
they
have
slighted
arises
through
the
energy
of
another
william
paterson
one
of
those
men
whose
capacity
is
measured
by
failure
or
success
was
the
originator
of
the
new
bank
and
it
is
perhaps
unfortunate
for
his
fame
that
no
biography
exists
of
this
remarkable
person
as
the
projector
of
the
present
bank
of
scotland
as
the
very
soul
of
the
celebrated
darien
company
and
as
the
founder
of
the
bank
of
england
he
deserves
notice
a
speculator
as
well
as
an
adventurous
man
he
proved
his
belief
in
the
practicability
of
the
darien
scheme
by
accompanying
that
unfortunate
expedition
and
the
formation
of
the
bank
of
england
was
the
object
of
his
desires
and
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
for
a
long
time
previous
to
its
establishment
from
that
political
change
which
had
been
so
justly
termed
the
great
revolution
to
the
establishment
of
the
bank
of
england
the
new
government
had
been
in
constant
difficulties
and
the
ministerial
mode
of
procuring
money
was
degrading
to
a
great
people
the
duties
in
support
of
the
war
waged
for
liberty
and
protestantism
were
required
before
they
were
levied
the
city
corporation
was
usually
applied
to
for
an
advance
interest
which
varied
probably
according
to
the
necessity
of
the
borrower
rather
than
to
the
real
value
of
cash
was
paid
for
the
accommodation
the
officers
of
the
city
went
round
in
their
turn
to
the
separate
wards
and
borrowed
in
smaller
amounts
the
money
they
had
advanced
to
the
state
interest
and
premiums
were
thus
often
paid
to
the
extent
of
and
even
per
in
proportion
to
the
exigency
of
the
case
and
the
trader
found
his
pocket
filled
at
the
expense
of
the
public
paterson
gives
a
graphic
description
the
erection
of
this
famous
bank
not
only
relieved
the
ministerial
managers
from
their
frequent
processions
into
the
city
for
borrowing
of
money
on
the
best
and
nearest
public
securities
at
or
per
cent
per
annum
but
likewise
gave
life
and
currency
to
double
or
treble
the
value
of
its
capital
in
other
branches
of
the
public
credit
and
so
under
god
became
the
principal
means
of
the
success
of
the
campaign
in
as
particularly
in
reducing
the
important
fortress
of
namur
the
first
material
step
toward
the
peace
concluded
in
to
remedy
this
evil
the
bank
of
england
was
projected
and
after
much
labor
william
paterson
aided
by
michael
godfrey
procured
from
government
a
consideration
of
the
proposal
the
king
was
abroad
when
the
scheme
was
laid
before
the
council
but
the
queen
occupied
his
place
here
considerable
opposition
occurred
paterson
found
it
more
difficult
to
procure
consent
than
he
anticipated
and
all
those
who
feared
an
invasion
of
their
interests
united
to
stop
its
progress
the
goldsmith
foresaw
the
destruction
of
his
monopoly
and
he
opposed
it
from
the
tory
foresaw
an
easier
mode
of
gaining
money
for
the
government
he
abhorred
with
a
firmer
hold
on
the
people
for
the
monarch
he
despised
and
his
antagonism
bore
all
the
energy
of
political
partisanship
the
usurer
foresaw
the
destruction
of
his
oppressive
extortion
and
he
resisted
it
with
the
vigor
of
his
craft
the
rich
man
foresaw
his
profits
diminished
on
government
contracts
and
he
vehemently
and
virtuously
opposed
it
on
all
public
principles
loud
therefore
were
the
outcries
and
great
the
exertions
of
all
parties
when
the
bill
was
first
introduced
to
the
house
of
commons
but
outcries
are
vain
and
exertions
futile
in
opposition
to
a
dominant
and
powerful
party
a
majority
had
been
secured
for
the
measure
and
they
who
opposed
its
progress
covered
their
defeat
with
vehement
denunciations
and
vague
prophecies
the
prophets
are
in
their
graves
and
their
predictions
only
survive
in
the
history
of
that
establishment
the
downfall
of
which
they
proclaimed
the
scheme
of
a
national
bank
says
smollett
had
been
recommended
to
the
ministry
for
the
credit
and
security
of
the
government
and
the
increase
of
trade
and
circulation
william
paterson
was
author
of
that
which
was
carried
into
execution
when
it
was
properly
digested
in
the
cabinet
and
a
majority
in
parliament
secured
it
was
introduced
into
the
house
of
commons
the
supporters
said
it
would
rescue
the
nation
out
of
the
hands
of
extortioners
lower
interest
raise
the
value
of
land
revive
public
credit
extend
circulation
improve
commerce
facilitate
the
annual
supplies
and
connect
the
people
more
closely
with
government
the
project
was
violently
opposed
by
a
strong
party
who
affirmed
that
it
would
become
a
monopoly
and
engross
the
whole
of
the
kingdom
that
it
might
be
employed
to
the
worst
purposes
of
arbitrary
power
that
it
would
weaken
commerce
by
tempting
people
to
withdraw
their
money
from
trade
that
brokers
and
jobbers
would
prey
on
their
encourage
fraud
and
gambling
and
corrupt
the
morals
of
the
nation
previous
governments
had
raised
money
with
comparative
ease
because
they
were
legitimate
that
of
william
was
felt
to
be
precarious
it
was
feared
by
the
that
a
similar
convulsion
to
the
one
which
had
borne
him
so
easily
to
the
throne
of
a
great
nation
might
waft
him
back
to
the
shores
of
that
holland
he
so
dearly
loved
thus
the
very
circumstances
which
made
supplies
necessary
also
made
them
scarce
in
addition
to
these
things
his
person
was
unpopular
his
phlegmatic
dutch
habits
contrasted
unfavorably
with
those
of
the
graceful
stuarts
whose
evil
qualities
were
forgotten
in
the
remembrance
of
their
showy
characteristics
neither
his
dutch
followers
nor
his
dutch
manners
were
regarded
with
favor
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
eminently
kingly
capacity
these
things
would
have
proved
as
dangerous
to
the
throne
as
they
tended
to
make
the
sovereign
unpopular
in
a
pamphlet
published
a
few
years
after
the
establishment
of
the
new
corporation
is
the
following
vivid
picture
of
this
monarch
government
in
spite
of
the
most
glorious
prince
and
most
vigilant
general
the
world
has
ever
seen
yet
the
enemy
gained
upon
us
every
year
the
funds
were
run
down
the
credit
jobbed
away
in
change
alley
the
king
and
his
troops
devoured
by
mechanics
and
sold
to
usury
tallies
lay
bundled
up
like
bath
fagots
in
the
hands
of
brokers
and
the
parliament
gave
taxes
levied
funds
but
the
loans
were
at
the
mercy
of
those
men
the
jobbers
and
they
showed
their
mercy
indeed
by
devouring
the
king
and
the
army
the
parliament
and
indeed
the
whole
nation
bringing
their
great
prince
sometimes
to
that
exigence
through
inexpressible
extortions
that
were
put
upon
him
that
he
has
even
gone
into
the
fields
without
his
equipage
nay
even
without
his
army
the
regiments
have
been
unclothed
when
the
king
had
been
in
the
field
and
the
willing
brave
english
spirits
eager
to
honor
their
country
and
follow
such
a
king
have
marched
even
to
battle
without
either
stockings
or
shoes
while
his
servants
have
been
every
day
working
in
exchange
alley
to
get
his
men
money
of
the
even
after
all
the
horrible
demands
of
discount
have
been
allowed
and
at
last
scarce
per
cent
of
the
money
granted
by
parliament
has
come
into
the
hands
of
the
exchequer
and
that
late
too
late
for
service
and
by
driblets
till
the
king
has
been
tired
with
the
delay
this
is
a
strange
picture
beating
even
paterson
account
of
the
processions
in
the
city
and
adds
another
convincing
proof
of
the
necessity
which
then
existed
for
some
establishment
capable
of
advancing
money
at
a
reasonable
rate
on
the
security
of
parliamentary
grants
the
scheme
proposed
by
william
paterson
was
too
important
not
to
meet
with
many
enemies
and
it
appears
from
a
pamphlet
by
godfrey
the
first
that
some
pretended
to
dislike
the
bank
only
for
fear
it
should
disappoint
their
majesties
of
the
supplies
proposed
to
be
raised
that
all
the
several
companies
of
oppressors
are
strangely
alarmed
and
exclaim
at
the
bank
and
seemed
to
have
joined
in
a
confederacy
against
it
that
extortion
usury
and
oppression
were
never
so
attacked
as
they
are
likely
to
be
by
the
bank
that
others
pretend
the
bank
will
join
with
the
prince
to
make
him
absolute
that
the
concern
have
too
good
a
bargain
and
that
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
trade
in
bishop
burners
of
his
own
we
read
an
additional
evidence
of
its
necessity
it
was
visible
that
all
the
enemies
of
the
government
set
themselves
against
it
with
such
a
vehemence
of
zeal
that
this
alone
convinced
all
people
that
they
saw
the
strength
that
our
affairs
would
receive
from
it
i
heard
the
dutch
often
reckon
the
great
advantage
they
had
had
from
their
banks
and
they
concluded
that
as
long
as
england
remained
jealous
of
her
government
a
bank
could
never
be
settled
among
us
nor
gain
credit
among
us
to
support
itself
and
upon
that
they
judged
that
the
superiority
in
trade
must
still
be
on
their
side
all
these
varied
interests
were
vainly
exerted
to
prevent
the
bill
from
receiving
the
royal
sanction
and
the
bank
of
england
founded
on
the
same
principles
which
guarded
the
banks
of
venice
and
genoa
was
incorporated
by
royal
charter
dated
july
from
gilbart
and
principles
of
we
present
the
following
brief
analysis
of
this
important
act
the
act
of
parliament
by
which
the
bank
was
established
is
entitled
act
for
granting
to
their
majesties
several
duties
upon
tonnage
of
ships
and
vessels
and
upon
beer
ale
and
other
liquors
for
securing
certain
recompenses
and
advantages
in
the
said
act
mentioned
to
such
persons
as
shall
voluntarily
advance
the
sum
of
fifteen
hundred
thousand
pounds
toward
carrying
on
the
war
with
france
after
a
variety
of
enactments
relative
to
the
duties
upon
tonnage
of
ships
and
vessels
and
upon
beer
ale
and
other
liquors
the
act
authorizes
the
raising
of
pounds
by
voluntary
subscription
the
subscribers
to
be
formed
into
a
corporation
and
be
styled
governor
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
the
sum
of
pounds
was
also
to
be
raised
by
subscription
and
the
contributors
to
receive
instead
annuities
for
one
two
or
three
lives
toward
the
pounds
no
one
person
was
to
subscribe
more
than
pounds
before
the
first
day
of
july
next
ensuing
nor
at
any
time
more
than
pounds
the
corporation
were
to
lend
their
whole
capital
to
the
government
for
which
they
were
to
receive
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
and
pounds
per
annum
for
management
being
pounds
per
annum
on
the
whole
the
corporation
were
not
allowed
to
borrow
or
owe
more
than
the
amount
of
their
capital
and
if
they
did
so
the
individual
members
became
liable
to
the
creditors
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
their
stock
the
corporation
were
not
to
trade
in
any
wares
or
merchandise
whatever
but
they
were
allowed
to
deal
in
bills
of
exchange
gold
or
silver
bullion
and
to
sell
any
goods
wares
or
merchandise
upon
which
they
had
advanced
money
and
which
had
not
been
redeemed
within
three
months
after
the
time
agreed
upon
the
whole
of
the
subscription
was
filled
in
a
few
days
per
cent
paid
down
and
as
we
have
seen
a
charter
was
issued
on
july
of
which
the
following
are
the
most
important
points
that
the
management
and
government
of
the
corporation
be
admitted
to
the
governor
and
directors
who
shall
be
elected
between
march
and
april
of
each
year
from
among
the
members
of
the
company
duly
qualified
that
no
dividend
shall
at
any
time
be
made
by
the
said
governor
and
company
save
only
out
of
the
interest
profit
or
produce
arising
out
of
the
said
capital
stock
or
fund
or
by
such
dealing
as
is
allowed
by
act
of
parliament
they
must
be
subjects
of
england
or
naturalized
subjects
they
shall
have
in
their
own
name
and
for
their
own
use
severally
the
governor
at
least
pounds
the
pounds
and
each
director
pounds
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
said
corporation
that
thirteen
or
more
of
the
said
governors
or
directors
of
which
the
governor
or
shall
be
always
one
shall
constitute
a
court
of
directors
for
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
company
and
for
the
appointment
of
all
agents
and
servants
which
may
be
necessary
paying
them
such
salaries
as
they
may
consider
reasonable
every
elector
must
have
in
his
own
name
and
for
his
own
use
pounds
or
more
capital
stock
and
can
only
give
one
vote
he
must
if
required
by
any
member
present
take
the
oath
of
stock
or
the
declaration
of
stock
if
it
be
one
of
those
people
called
quakers
four
general
courts
to
be
held
in
every
year
in
the
months
of
september
december
april
and
july
a
general
court
may
be
summoned
at
any
time
upon
the
requisition
of
nine
proprietors
duly
qualified
as
electors
the
majority
of
electors
in
general
courts
have
the
power
to
make
and
constitute
and
ordinances
for
the
government
of
the
corporation
provided
that
such
and
ordinances
be
not
repugnant
to
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
and
be
confirmed
and
approved
according
to
the
statutes
in
such
case
made
and
provided
when
the
payment
was
completed
it
was
handed
into
the
exchequer
and
the
bank
procured
from
other
quarters
the
funds
which
it
required
it
employed
the
same
means
which
the
bankers
had
done
at
the
exchange
with
this
difference
that
the
latter
traded
with
personal
property
while
the
bank
traded
with
the
deposits
of
their
customers
it
was
from
the
circulation
of
a
capital
so
formed
that
the
bank
derived
its
profits
it
is
evident
however
from
the
pamphlet
of
the
first
that
at
this
period
they
allowed
interest
to
their
depositors
and
another
writer
makes
it
a
subject
of
complaint
it
would
be
for
the
general
good
of
trade
if
the
bank
were
restrained
from
allowing
interest
for
running
cash
for
the
ease
of
having
and
per
cent
without

looked
into
the

where
the

says
the

essayist
of
the

and
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
see
the
directors
secretaries
and
clerks
with
all
the
other
members
of
that
wealthy
corporation
ranged
in
their
several
stations
according
to
the
parts
they
hold
in
that
just
and
regular
economy
the
secretaries
and
clerks
altogether
numbered
but
while
their
united
salaries
did
not
exceed
four
thousand
three
hundred
fifty
pounds
but
the
picture
is
a
pleasant
one
and
though
so
much
unlike
present
usages
it
is
doubtful
whether
our
forefathers
did
not
derive
more
benefit
from
intimate
association
with
and
kindly
feelings
toward
their
inferiors
than
their
descendants
receive
from

the
effect
of
the
new

was
almost
immediately
experienced
on
august
in
the
year
of
its
establishment
the
rate
of
discount
on
foreign
bills
was
per

this
was

the

of

the

was
established
in
and
for
that
year
only
was
its
founder
among
those
who
managed
its
proceedings
the
facts
which
led
to
his
departure
from
the
honorable
post
of
director
are
difficult
to
collect
but
it
is
not
at
all
improbable
that
the
character
of
paterson
was
too
speculative
for
those
with
whom
he
was
joined
in
companionship

these

must
be
received
with
caution
accusations
against
a

are
easily
made
and
it
is
rarely
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
the

to
reply
they

a
glowing
and
picturesque
account
on
february
iberville
and
bienville
reached
the
mississippi
when
they
approached
its
mouth
they
were
struck
with
the
gloomy
magnificence
of
the
sight
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
reeds
which
rose
five
or
six
feet
above
the
waters
in
which
they
bathed
their
roots
they
waved
mournfully
under
the
blast
of
the
sharp
wind
of
the
north
shivering
in
its
icy
grasp
as
it
tumbled
rolled
and
gambolled
on
the
pliant
surface
multitudes
of
birds
of
strange
appearance
with
their
elongated
shapes
so
lean
that
they
looked
like
metamorphosed
ghosts
clothed
in
plumage
screamed
in
the
air
as
if
they
were
scared
of
one
another
there
was
something
agonizing
in
their
shrieks
that
was
in
harmony
with
the
desolation
of
the
place
on
every
side
of
the
vessel
monsters
of
the
deep
and
huge
alligators
heaved
themselves
up
heavily
from
their
native
or
favorite
element
and
floating
lazily
on
the
turbid
waters
seemed
to
gaze
at
the
intruders
down
the
river
and
rumbling
over
its
bed
there
came
a
sort
of
low
distant
thunder
was
it
the
voice
of
the
hoary
sire
of
rivers
raised
in
anger
at
the
prospect
of
his
gigantic
volume
of
waters
being
suddenly
absorbed
by
one
mightier
than
he
in
their
progress
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
the
travellers
could
keep
their
bark
free
from
those
enormous
rafts
of
trees
which
the
mississippi
seemed
to
toss
about
in
mad
frolic
a
poet
would
have
thought
that
the
great
river
when
departing
from
the
altitude
of
its
birthplace
and
as
it
rushed
down
to
the
sea
through
three
thousand
miles

in
anticipation
of
a
contest
which
threatened
the
continuation
of
its
existence
flung
its
broad
arms
right
and
left
across
the
continent
and
uprooting
all
its
forests
had
hoarded
them
in
its
bed
as
missiles
to
hurl
at
the
head
of
its
mighty
rival
when
they
should
meet
and
struggle
for
supremacy
when
night
began
to
cast
a
darker
hue
on
a
landscape
on
which
the
imagination
of
dante
would
have
gloated
there
issued
from
that
chaos
of
reeds
such
uncouth
and
unnatural
sounds
as
would
have
saddened
the
gayest
and
appalled
the
most
intrepid
could
this
be
the
mississippi
or
was
it
not
rather
old
avernus
it
was
hideous
indeed
but
hideousness
refined
into
sublimity
filling
the
soul
with
a
sentiment
of
grandeur
nothing
daunted
the
adventurers
kept
steadily
on
their
course
they
knew
that
through
those
dismal
portals
they
were
to
arrive
at
the
most
magnificent
country
in
the
world
they
knew
that
awful
screen
concealed
loveliness
itself
it
was
a
coquettish
freak
of
nature
when
dealing
with
european
curiosity
as
it
came
eagerly
bounding
to
the
atlantic
wave
to
herald
it
through
an
avenue
so
sombre
as
to
cause
the
wonders
of
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
to
burst
with
tenfold
more
force
upon
the
bewildered
gaze
of
those
who
by
the
endurance
of
so
many
perils
and
fatigues
were
to
merit
admittance
into
its
eden
it
was
a
relief
for
the
adventurers
when
after
having
toiled
up
the
river
for
ten
days
they
at
last
arrived
at
the
village

appalling
nature
retraced
his

heroic
unconcern
a

three
thousand

such
difficulties

imagine

slight
swelling
of
the
shore
about
four
acres
square
sloping
gently
to

background

on

bay
thus
this
position
was
fortified
by
nature

the
french
skilfully
availed
themselves
of
these
advantages
the
weakest
point
which
was
on
the
side
of
the

they
strengthened
with
more
care
than
the

connecting
with
a
strong
intrenchment
the
two
ravines
which
ran
to
the

faced

both
at

to
be
within
a
close
proximity

no
better
description
can
be
given
than
to
say
that
the

looked
like
a
funnel
to
which

was
the
lid
not
fitting
closely
however
but
leaving
apertures
for
egress

the
snugness
of

locality
had
tempted
the
french
and
had
induced
them
to
choose
it
as
the
most
favorable
spot

how
deeply

have
been
the
parting
scene
how
many

might
prevent
those
who
remained
in

unknown

from
ever
seeing
again
those
who
through

filled
up

of
companions
when
they
beheld
the
sails
of

fleet
fading
in
the
distance
like
transient
clouds
well
may
it
be
supposed
that
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
their
very
souls
had
been
carried
away
and
that
they
felt
a
momentary
sinking
of
the
heart
when
they
found
themselves
abandoned
and
necessarily
left
to
their
own
resources
scanty
as
they
were
on
a
patch
of
land
between
the
ocean
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
wilderness
which
fancy
peopled
with
every
sort
of
terrors
the
sense
of
their
loneliness
fell
upon
them
like
the
gloom
of
night
darkening
their
hopes
and
filling
their
hearts
with
dismal
apprehensions
but
as
the
country
had
been
ordered
to
be
explored
sauvolle
availed
himself
of
that
circumstance
to
refresh
the
minds
of
his
men
by
the
excitement
of
an
expedition
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
he
therefore
hastened
to
despatch
most
of
them
with
bienville
who
with
a
chief
of
the
bayagoulas
for
his
guide
went
to
visit
the
colapissas
they
inhabited
the
northern
shore
of
lake
pontchartrain
and
their
domains
embraced
the
sites
now
occupied
by
lewisburg
mandeville
and
fontainebleau
that
tribe
numbered
three
hundred
warriors
who
in
their
distant
had
been
engaged
in
frequent
skirmishes
with
some
of
the
british
colonists
in
south
carolina
when
the
french
landed
they
were
informed
that
two
days
previous
the
village
of
the
colapissas
had
been
attacked
by
a
party
of
two
hundred
chickasaws
headed
by
two
englishmen
these
were
the
first
tidings
which
the
french
had
of
their
old
rivals
and
which
proved
to
be
the
harbinger
of
the
incessant
struggle
which
was
to
continue
for
more
than
a
century
between
the
two
races
and
to
terminate
by
the
permanent
occupation
of
louisiana
by
the
bienville
returned
to
the
fort
to
convey
this
important
information
to
sauvolle
after
having
rested
there
for
several
days
he
went
to
the
bay
of
pascagoulas
and
ascended
the
river
which
bears
that
name
and
the
banks
of
which
were
tenanted
by
a
branch
of
the
biloxis
and
by
the
moelobites
encouraged
by
the
friendly
reception
which
he
met
everywhere
he
ventured
farther
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
mobilians
who
entertained
him
with
great
hospitality
bienville
found
them
much
reduced
from
what
they
had
been
and
listened
with
eagerness
to
the
many
tales
of
their
former
power
which
had
been
rapidly
declining
since
the
crushing
blow
they
had
received
from
de
soto
when
iberville
ascended
the
mississippi
the
first
time
he
had
remarked
bayou
plaquemines
and
bayou
chetimachas
the
one
he
called
after
the
fruit
of
certain
trees
which
appeared
to
have
exclusive
possession
of
its
banks
and
the
other
after
the
name
of
the
indians
who
dwelt
in
the
vicinity
he
had
ordered
them
to
be
explored
and
the
indefatigable
bienville
on
his
return
from
mobile
obeyed
the
instructions
left
to
his
brother
and
made
an
accurate
survey
of
these
two
bayous
when
he
was
coming
down
the
river
at
the
distance
of
about
eighteen
miles
below
the
site
where
new
orleans
now
stands
he
met
an
english
vessel
of
sixteen
guns
under
the
command
of
captain
bar
the
english
captain
informed
the
french
that
he
was
examining
the
banks
of
the
river
with
the
intention
of
selecting
a
spot
for
the
foundation
of
a
colony
bienville
told
him
that
louisiana
was
a
dependency
of
canada
that
the
french
had
already
made
several
establishments
on
the
mississippi
and
he
appealed
in
confirmation
of
his
assertions
to
their
own
presence
in
the
river
in
such
small
boats
which
evidently
proved
the
existence
of
some
settlement
close
at
hand
the
englishman
believed
bienville
and
sailed
back
where
this
occurrence
took
place
the
river

a
considerable
bend
and
it
was
from
the
circumstance
which
i
have
related
that
the
spot
received
the
appellation
of
the
english
turn
a
name
which
it
has
retained
to
the
present
day
it
was
not
far
from
that
place
the
atmosphere
of
which
appears
to
be
fraught
with
some
malignant
spell
hostile
to
the
sons
of

that
the
english
who
were
outwitted
by
bienville
in
met
with
a
signal
defeat
in
battle
from
the
americans
in
the
diplomacy
of
bienville
and
the
military
genius
of
jackson
proved
to
them
equally
fatal
when
they
aimed
at
the
possession
of
louisiana
since
the
exploring
expedition
of
la
salle
down
the
mississippi
canadian
hunters
whose
habits
and
intrepidity
fenimore
cooper
has
so
graphically
described
in
the
character
of
used
to
extend
their
roving
excursions
to
the
banks
of
that
river
and
those
holy
missionaries
of
the
church
who
as
the
pioneers
of
religion
have
filled
the
new
world
with
their
sufferings
and
whose
incredible
deeds
in
the
service
of
god
afford
so
many
materials
for
the
most
interesting
of
books
had
come
in
advance
of
the
pickaxe
of
the
settler
and
had
domiciliated
themselves
among
the
tribes
who
lived
near
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
one
of
them
father
montigny
was
residing
with
the
tensas
within
the
territory
of
the
present
parish
of
tensas
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
another
father
davion
was
the
pastor
of
the
yazoos
in
the
present
state
of
mississippi
such
were
the
two
visitors
who
in
appeared
before
sauvolle
at
the
fort
of
biloxi
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
his
cheerless
existence
and
to
encourage
him
in
his
colonizing
enterprise
their
visit
however
was
not
of
long
duration
and
they
soon
returned
to
discharge
the
duties
of
their
sacred
mission
iberville
had
been
gone
for
several
months
and
the
year
was
drawing
to
a
close
without
any
tidings
of
him
a
deeper
gloom
had
settled
over
the
little
colony
at
biloxi
when
on
december
some
were
heard
at
sea
and
the
grateful
sound
came
booming
over
the
waters
spreading
joy
in
every
breast
there
was
not
one
who
was
not
almost
oppressed
with
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
at
last
friends
were
coming
bringing
relief
to
the
body
and
to
the
soul
every
colonist
hastily
abandoned
his
occupation
of
the
moment
and
ran
to
the
shore
the
soldier
himself
in
the
eagerness
of
expectation
left
his
post
of
duty
and
rushed
to
the
parapet
which
overlooked
the
bay
presently
several
vessels
hove
in
sight
bearing
the
white
flag
of
france
and
approaching
as
near
as
the
shallowness
of
the
beach
permitted
folded
their
pinions
like
seeking
repose
on
the
crest
of
the
billows
it
was
iberville
returning
with
the
news
that
on
his
representations
sauvolle
had
been
appointed
by
the
king
governor
of
louisiana
bienville
and
boisbriant
commander
of
the
fort
at
biloxi
with
the
grade
of
major
iberville
having
been
informed
by
bienville
of
the
attempt
of
the
english
to
make
a
settlement
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
foiled
resolved
to
take
precautionary
measures
against
the
repetition
of
any
similar
attempt
without
loss
of
time
he
departed
with
bienville
on
january
and
running
up
the
river
he
constructed
a
small
fort
on
the
first
solid
ground
which
he
met
and
which
is
said
to
have
been
at
a
distance
of
miles
from
its
mouth
when
so
engaged
the
two
brothers
one
day
saw
a
canoe
rapidly
sweeping
down
the
river
and
approaching
the
spot
where
they
stood
it
was
occupied
by
eight
men
six
of
whom
were
rowers
the
seventh
was
the
steersman
and
the
eighth
from
his
appearance
was
evidently
of
a
superior
order
to
that
of
his
companions
and
the
commander
of
the
party
well
may
it
be
imagined
what
greeting
the
stranger
received
when
leaping
on
shore
he
made
himself
known
as
the
chevalier
de
tonty
who
had
again
heard
of
the
establishment
of
a
colony
in
louisiana
and
who
for
the
second
time
had
come
to
see
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
report
with
what
emotion
did
iberville
and
bienville
fold
in
their
arms
the
faithful
companion
and
friend
of
la
salle
of
whom
they
had
heard
so
many
wonderful
tales
from
the
indians
to
whom
he
was
so
well
known
under
the
name
of
iron
hand
with
what
admiration
they
looked
at
his
person
and
with
what
increasing
interest
they
listened
to
his
long
recitals
of
what
he
had
done
and
had
seen
on
that
broad
continent
the
threshold
of
which
they
had
hardly
passed
after
having
rested
three
days
at
the
fort
the
indefatigable
tonty
reascended
the
mississippi
with
iberville
and
bienville
and
finally
parted
with
them
at
natchez
iberville
was
so
much
pleased
with
that
part
of
the
bank
of
the
river
where
now
exists
the
city
of
natchez
that
he
marked
it
down
as
a
most
eligible
spot
for
a
town
of
which
he
drew
the
plan
and
which
he
called
rosalie
after
the
maiden
name
of
the
countess
pontchartrain
the
wife
of
the
chancellor
he
then
returned
to
the
new
fort
he
was
erecting
on
the
mississippi
and
bienville
went
to
explore
the
country
of
the
yatasses
of
the
natchitoches
and
of
the
ouachitas
what
romance
can
be
more
agreeable
to
the
imagination
than
to
accompany
iberville
and
bienville
in
their
wild
explorations
and
to
compare
the
state
of
the
country
in
their
time
with
what
it
is
in
our
days
when
the
french
were
at
natchez
they
were
struck
with
horror
at
an
occurrence
too
clearly
demonstrating
the
fierceness
of
disposition
of
that
tribe
which
was
destined
in
after
years
to
become
celebrated
in
the
history
of
louisiana
one
of
their
temples
having
been
set
on
fire
by
lightning
a
hideous
spectacle
presented
itself
to
the
europeans
the
tumultuous
rush
of
the
indians
the
infernal
howlings
and
lamentations
of
the
men
women
and
children
the
unearthly
vociferations
of
the
priests
their
fantastic
dances
and
ceremonies
around
the
burning
edifice
the
demoniac
fury
with
which
mothers
rushed
to
the
fatal
spot
and
with
the
piercing
cries
and
gesticulations
of
maniacs
flung
their
babes
into
the
flames
to
pacify
their
irritated
deity
the
increasing
anger
of
the
heavens
blackening
with
the
impending
storm
the
lurid
flashes
of
lightning
darting
as
it
were
in
mutual
enmity
from
the
clashing
clouds
the
low
distant
growling
of
the
coming
tempest
the
long
column
of
smoke
and
fire
shooting
upward
from
the
funeral
pyre
and
looking
like
one
of
the
gigantic
torches
of
pandemonium
the
war
of
the
elements
combined
with
the
worst
effects
of
frenzied
superstition
of
man
the
suddenness
and
strangeness
of
the
awful
scene
all
the
circumstances
produced
such
an
impression
upon
the
french
as
to
deprive
them
for
a
moment
of
the
powers
of
volition
and
action
rooted
to
the
ground
they
stood
aghast
with
astonishment
and
indignation
at
the
appalling
scene
was
it
a
dream
a
wild
delirium
of
the
mind
but
no
the
monstrous
reality
of
the
vision
was
but
too
apparent
and
they
threw
themselves
among
the
indians
supplicating
them
to
cease
their
horrible
sacrifice
to
their
gods
and
joining
threats
to
their
supplications
owing
to
this
intervention
and
perhaps
because
a
sufficient
number
of
victims
had
been
offered
the
priests
gave
the
signal
of
retreat
and
the
indians
slowly
withdrew
from
the
accursed
spot
such
was
the
aspect
under
which
the
natchez
showed
themselves
for
the
first
time
to
their
visitors
it
was
ominous
presage
for
the
future
after
these
explorations
iberville
departed
again
for
france
to
solicit
additional
assistance
from
the
government
and
left
bienville
in
command
of
the
new
fort
on
the
mississippi
it
was
very
hard
for
the
two
brothers
sauvolle
and
bienville
to
be
thus
separated
when
they
stood
so
much
in
need
of
each
other
countenance
to
breast
the
difficulties
that
sprung
up
around
them
with
a
luxuriance
which
they
seemed
to
borrow
from
the
vegetation
of
the
country
the
distance
between
the
mississippi
and
biloxi
was
not
so
easily
overcome
in
those
days
as
in
ours
and
the
means
which
the
two
brothers
had
of
communing
together
were
very
scanty
and
uncertain
sauvolle
died
august
and
louisiana
remained
under
the
sole
charge
of
bienville
who
though
very
young
was
fully
equal
to
meet
that
emergency
by
the
maturity
of
his
mind
and
by
his
other
qualifications
he
had
hardly
consigned
his
brother
to
the
tomb
when
iberville
returned
with
two
ships
of
the
line
and
a
brig
laden
with
troops
and
provisions
according
to
iberville
orders
and
in
conformity
with
the
instructions
bienville
left
boisbriant
his
cousin
with
twenty
men
at
the
old
fort
of
biloxi
and
transported
the
principal
seat
of
the
colony
to
the
western
side
of
the
river
mobile
not
far
from
the
spot
where
now
stands
the
city
of
mobile
near
the
mouth
of
that
river
there
is
an
island
which
the
french
had
called
massacre
island
from
the
great
quantity
of
human
bones
which
they
found
bleaching
on
its
shores
it
was
evident
that
there
some
awful
tragedy
had
been
acted
but
tradition
when
interrogated
laid
her
choppy
finger
upon
her
skinny
lips
and
answered
not
this
uncertainty
giving
a
free
scope
to
the
imagination
shrouded
the
place
with
a
higher
degree
of
horror
and
with
a
deeper
hue
of
fantastical
gloom
it
looked
like
the
favorite
ballroom
of
the
witches
of
hell
the
wind
sighed
so
mournfully
through
the
pines
those
vampire
heads
seemed
incessantly
to
bow
to
some
invisible
and
grisly
visitors
the
footsteps
of
the
stranger
emitted
such
an
awful
and
supernatural
sound
when
trampling
on
the
skulls
which
strewed
his
path
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
coldest
imagination
not
to
labor
under
some
crude
and
apprehension
verily
the
weird
sisters
could
not
have
chosen
a
fitter
abode
nevertheless
the
french
supported
by
their
mercurial
temperament
were
not
deterred
from
forming
an
establishment
on
that
sepulchral
island
which
they
thought
afforded
some
facilities
for
their
transatlantic
communications
in
war
had
broken
out
between
great
britain
france
and
spain
and
iberville
a
distinguished
officer
of
the
french
navy
was
engaged
in
expeditions
that
kept
him
away
from
the
colony
it
did
not
cease
however
to
occupy
his
thoughts
and
had
become
clothed
in
his
eye
with
a
sort
of
family
interest
louisiana
was
thus
left
for
some
time
to
her
scanty
resources
but
weak
as
she
was
she
gave
early
proofs
of
that
generous
spirit
which
has
ever
since
animated
her
and
on
the
towns
of
pensacola
and
augustine
then
in
possession
of
the
spaniards
being
threatened
with
an
invasion
by
the
english
of
south
carolina
she
sent
to
her
neighbors
what
help
she
could
in
men
ammunition
and
supplies
of
all
sorts
it
was
the
more
meritorious
as
it
was
the
of
the
poor
the
year
slowly
rolled
by
and
gave
way
to
still
nothing
was
heard
from
the
parent
country
there
seemed
to
be
an
impassable
barrier
between
the
old
and
the
new
continent
the
milk
which
flowed
from
the
motherly
breast
of
france
could
no
longer
reach
the
parched
lips
of
her
infant
and
famine
began
to
pinch
the
colonists
who
scattered
themselves
all
along
the
coast
to
live
by
fishing
they
were
reduced
to
the
veriest
extremity
of
misery
and
despair
had
settled
in
every
bosom
in
spite
of
the
encouragements
of
bienville
who
displayed
the
most
manly
fortitude
amid
all
the
trials
to
which
he
was
subjected
when
suddenly
a
vessel
made
its
appearance
the
colonists
rushed
to
the
shore
with
wild
anxiety
but
their
exultation
was
greatly
diminished
when
on
the
nearer
approach
of
the
moving
speck
they
recognized
the
spanish
instead
of
the
french
flag
it
was
relief
however
coming
to
them
and
proffered
by
a
friendly
hand
it
was
a
return
made
by
the
governor
of
pensacola
for
the
kindness
he
had
experienced
the
year
previous
thus
the
debt
of
gratitude
was
paid
it
was
a
practical
lesson
where
the
seeds
of
charity
are
cast
there
springs
the
harvest
in
time
of
need
good
things
like
evils
do
not
come
singly
and
this
succor
was
but
the
herald
of
another
one
still
more
effectual
in
the
shape
of
a
ship
from
france
iberville
had
not
been
able
to
redeem
his
pledge
to
the
poor
colonists
but
he
had
sent
his
brother
chateaugué
in
his
place
at
the
imminent
risk
of
being
captured
by
the
english
who
occupied
at
that
time
most
of
the
avenues
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
he
was
not
the
man
to
spare
either
himself
or
his
family
in
cases
of
emergency
and
his
heroic
soul
was
inured
to
such
sacrifices
grateful
the
colonists
were
for
this
act
of
devotedness
and
they
resumed
the
occupation
of
their
tenements
which
they
had
abandoned
in
search
of
food
the
aspect
of
things
was
suddenly
changed
abundance
and
hope
reappeared
in
the
land
whose
population
was
increased
by
the
arrival
of
seventeen
persons
who
came
under
the
guidance
of
chateaugué
with
the
intention
of
making
a
permanent
settlement
and
who
in
evidence
of
their
determination
had
provided
themselves
with
all
the
implements
of
husbandry
we
who
daily
see
hundreds
flocking
to
our
shores
and
who
look
at
the
occurrence
with
as
much
unconcern
as
at
the
passing
cloud
can
hardly
conceive
the
excitement
produced
by
the
arrival
of
these
seventeen
emigrants
among
men
who
for
nearly
two
years
had
been
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
a
denizen
of
the
moon
dropping
on
this
planet
would
not
be
stared
at
and
interrogated
with
more
eager
curiosity
this
excitement
had
hardly
subsided
when
it
was
revived
by
the
appearance
of
another
ship
and
it
became
intense
when
the
inhabitants
saw
a
procession
of
twenty
females
with
veiled
faces
proceeding
arm
in
arm
and
two
by
two
to
the
house
of
the
governor
who
received
them
in
state
and
provided
them
with
suitable
lodgings
what
did
it
mean
innumerable
were
the
gossipings
of
the
day
and
part
of
the
coming
night
itself
was
spent
in
endless
commentaries
and
conjectures
but
the
next
morning
which
was
sunday
the
mystery
was
cleared
by
the
officiating
priest
reading
from
the
pulpit
after
mass
and
for
the
general
information
the
following
communication
from
the
minister
to
bienville
his
majesty
sends
twenty
girls
to
be
married
to
the
canadians
and
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
mobile
in
order
to
consolidate
the
colony
all
these
girls
are
industrious
and
have
received
a
pious
and
virtuous
education
beneficial
results
to
the
colony
are
expected
from
their
teaching
their
useful
attainments
to
the
indian
females
in
order
that
none
should
be
sent
except
those
of
known
virtue
and
of
unspotted
reputation
his
majesty
did
intrust
the
bishop
of
québec
with
the
mission
of
taking
these
girls
from
such
establishments
as
from
their
very
nature
and
character
would
put
them
at
once
above
all
suspicions
of
corruption
you
will
take
care
to
settle
them
in
life
as
well
as
may
be
in
your
power
and
to
marry
them
to
such
men
as
are
capable
of
providing
them
with
a
commodious
home
this
was
a
very
considerate
recommendation
and
very
kind
it
was
indeed
from
the
great
louis
xiv
one
of
the
proudest
monarchs
that
ever
lived
to
descend
from
his
olympian
seat
of
majesty
to
the
level
of
such
details
and
to
such
minute
instructions
for
ministering
to
the
personal
comforts
of
his
remote
louisianan
subjects
many
were
the
gibes
and
high
was
the
glee
on
that
occasion
pointed
were
the
jokes
aimed
at
young
bienville
on
his
being
thus
transformed
into
a
matrimonial
agent
and
the
intentions
of
the
king
however
were
faithfully
executed
and
more
than
one
rough
but
honest
canadian
boatman
of
the
lawrence
and
of
the
mississippi
closed
his
adventurous
and
erratic
career
and
became
a
domestic
and
useful
member
of
that
little
commonwealth
under
the
watchful
influence
of
the
maid
of
the
loire
or
of
the
seine
infinite
are
the
chords
of
the
lyre
which
delights
the
romantic
muse
and
these
incidents
small
and
humble
as
they
are
appear
to
me
to
be
imbued
with
an
indescribable
charm
which
appeals
to
her
imagination
prussia

few
historical

more
distinctly
traceable

of
greater
importance
than
that
of
the
margravate
of
brandenburg
into
the
kingdom
of
prussia
the
principal
state
of
the
present
german
empire
as
far
back
as
the
tenth
century
the
name
preussen
prussia
was
applied
to
a
region
lying
east
of
brandenburg
which
in
that
century
became
a
german
margravate
at
that
time
the
inhabitants
of
prussia
were
still
heathens
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
were
converted
to
christianity
having
first
been
conquered
by
the
teutonic
knights
in
a
series
of
remorseless
wars
continued
for
almost
fifty
years
german
colonization
followed
the
conquest
in
nearly
the
whole
of
prussia
was
wrested
from
the
teutonic
knights
and
annexed
to
the
polish
crown
soon
after
the
beginning
of
the
reformation
the
teutonic
knights
embraced
protestantism
and
the
order
became
secularized
in
the
knights
formally
surrendered
to
king
sigismund
of
poland
their
late
grand
master
was
created
duke
of
prussia
and
this
with
other
former
possessions
of
the
order
was
held
by
him
as
a
vassal
of
the
polish
crown
this
relation
continued
until
when
the
duchy
of
prussia
was
united
with
brandenburg
which
had
become
a
german
electorate
during
the
thirty
years
war
the
enlarged
electorate
took
little
part
in
affairs
but
suffered
much
from
the
ravages
of
the
conflict
under
the
electorate
of
george
william
who
died
in
brandenburg
became
almost
a
desert
and
in
this
impoverished
condition
was
left
to
his
son
frederick
william
the
great
elector
who
restored
it
to
prosperity
and
strengthened
its
somewhat
insecure
sovereignty
over
the
duchy
of
prussia
the
great
elector
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
frederick
iii
of
brandenburg
this
elector
through
the
series
of
events
narrated
by
ranke
became
the
founder
of
the
prussian
monarchy
and
is
known
in
history
as
frederick
i
he
founded
the
academy
of
sciences
in
berlin
and
the
university
of
halle
frederick
i
the
next
heir
and
successor
to
the
great
elector
though
far
inferior
to
his
father
in
native
energy
of
character
can
not
be
accused
of
having
flinched
from
the
task
imposed
on
him
above
all
the
warlike
fame
of
the
brandenburg
troops
suffered
no
diminution
under
his
reign
his
army
took
a
very
prominent
and
active
part
in
the
most
important
events
of
that
period
prince
william
of
orange
might
perhaps
have
hesitated
whether
to
try
the
adventure
which
made
him
king
of
england
had
not
the
dutch
troops
which
he
was
forced
to
withdraw
from
the
netherlands
for
his
expedition
been
replaced
by
some
from
brandenburg
the
fact
has
indeed
been
disputed
but
on
closer
investigation
its
truth
has
been
established
beyond
doubt
that
many
other
brandenburg
soldiers
in
his
service
and
that
of
his
republic
followed
him
to
england
where
they
contributed
essentially
to
his
success
in
the
war
which
now
broke
out
upon
the
rhine
the
young
elector
frederick
took
the
field
himself
inflamed
by
religious
enthusiasm
patriotism
and
personal
ambition
on
one
occasion
at
the
siege
of
bonn
when
he
was
anxious
about
the
result
he
stepped
aside
to
the
window
and
prayed
to
god
that
he
might
suffer
no
disgrace
in
this
his
first
enterprise
he
was
successful
in
his
attack
upon
bonn
and
cleared
the
whole
lower
rhine
of
the
hostile
troops
he
at
the
same
time
gained
a
high
reputation
for
personal
courage
long
after
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
the
presence
of
the
elector
contributed
in
a
great
measure
to
the
speedy
termination
of
the
first
important
siege
that
of
kaiserswerth
a
point
from
which
the
french
threatened
at
once
both
holland
and
westphalia
but
it
was
not
only
when
led
by
the
elector
that
his
troops
distinguished
themselves
by
their
courage
they
fought
most
bravely
at
the
battle
of
hochstadt
prince
eugene
under
whose
command
they
stood
could
scarce
find
words
strong
enough
to
praise
the
undaunted
steadfastness
with
which
they
first
withstood
the
shock
of
the
enemy
attack
and
then
helped
to
break
through
his
tremendous
fire
two
years
later
at
turin
they
helped
to
settle
the
affairs
of
italy
in
the
same
manner
as
they
had
already
done
in
those
of
germany
headed
by
prince
leopold
of
anhalt
they
climbed
over
the
enemy
intrenchments
under
the
full
fire
of
his
artillery
shouting
the
old
brandenburg
of
go
on
the
warlike
enterprise
of
brandenburg
never
spread
over
a
wider
field
than
under
frederick
i
then
it
was
that
they
first
met
the
turks
in
terrible
battles
they
showed
themselves
in
the
south
of
france
at
the
siege
of
toulon
in
their
camp
the
protestant
service
was
performed
for
the
first
time
in
the
territories
of
the
pope
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
country
came
to
look
on
and
displayed
a
certain
satisfaction
at
the
sight
but
the
netherlands
were
always
the
scene
of
their
greatest
achievements
and
at
that
time
an
excellent
school
for
their
further
progress
in
the
art
of
war
there
they
might
at
once
study
sieges
under
the
dutch
commanders
vauban
and
cochorn
and
campaigns
under
marlborough
one
of
the
greatest
generals
of
all
times
throughout
all
the
years
of
his
reign
frederick
steadily
adhered
to
the
great
alliance
which
his
father
had
helped
to
form
so
long
as
that
alliance
continued
to
subsist
and
indeed
the
interest
which
he
took
in
the
affairs
of
europe
at
large
was
in
the
end
of
great
advantage
to
himself
and
to
his
house
that
very
alliance
was
the
original
cause
of
his
gaining
a
crown
the
foundation
of
the
prussian
monarchy
it
will
not
be
denied
even
by
those
who
think
most
meanly
of
the
externals
of
rank
and
title
that
the
attainment
of
a
higher
step
in
the
european
hierarchy
as
it
then
stood
was
an
object
worth
striving
for
the
western
principalities
and
republics
still
formed
a
great
corporation
at
the
head
of
which
was
the
german
emperor
even
the
crown
of
france
had
to
submit
to
manifold
and
wearisome
negotiations
in
order
to
obtain
the
predicate
of
majesty
which
until
then
had
belonged
exclusively
to
the
emperor
the
other
sovereigns
then
laid
claim
to
the
same
dignity
as
that
enjoyed
by
the
king
of
france
and
the
venetian
republic
to
an
equal
rank
with
those
on
the
score
of
the
kingdoms
which
she
once
possessed
and
accordingly
the
electoral
ambassadors
to
vienna
had
to
stand
bareheaded
while
the
venetian
covered
his
head
the
electors
and
reigning
dukes
were
but
with
such
precedence
and
in
their
turn
laid
claim
to
the
designation
of
serenissimus
and
the
title
of
brother
for
themselves
and
the
style
of
excellency
for
their
ambassadors
but
even
the
most
powerful
among
the
electors
found
it
difficult
to
advance
a
single
step
in
this
matter
because
whatever
privileges
were
conceded
to
them
were
immediately
claimed
by
all
the
rest
many
of
whom
were
mere
barons
of
the
empire
it
is
evident
that
brandenburg
was
interested
in
being
freed
at
once
from
these
negotiations
which
only
served
to
impede
and
embarrass
all
really
important
business
there
exists
the
distinct
assertion
of
a
highly
placed
official
man
that
the
royal
title
had
been
promised
to
the
elector
frederick
william
his
son
now
centred
his
whole
ambition
in
its
attainment
frederick
while
elector
was
one
of
the
most
popular
princes
that
ever
reigned
in
brandenburg
his
contemporaries
praise
him
for
his
avoidance
of
all
dissipation
and
his
life
entirely
devoted
to
duty
while
his
subjects
were
still
asleep
say
they
the
prince
was
already
busied
with
their
affairs
for
he
rose
very
early
a
poet
of
the
time
makes
phosphorus
complain
that
he
is
ever
anticipated
by
the
king
of
prussia
his
manners
were
gracious
familiar
sincere
and
deliberate
his
conversation
indicated
righteous
and
princely
thoughts
those
essays
written
by
him
which
we
have
read
exhibit
a
sagacious
and
careful
treatment
of
the
subjects
under
consideration
he
shared
in
a
very
great
degree
the
taste
of
his
times
for
outward
show
and
splendor
but
in
him
it
took
a
direction
which
led
to
something
far
higher
than
mere
ostentation
the
works
of
sculpture
and
architecture
produced
under
his
reign
are
monuments
of
a
pure
and
severe
taste
the
capital
of
prussia
has
seen
none
more
beautiful
he
complacently
indulged
in
the
contemplation
of
the
greatness
founded
by
his
father
the
possession
of
a
territory
four
times
as
large
as
that
of
any
other
elector
and
the
power
of
bringing
into
the
field
an
army
which
placed
him
on
a
level
with
kings
now
however
he
desired
that
this
equality
should
be
publicly
recognized
especially
as
he
had
no
lack
of
treasure
and
revenue
wherewith
to
maintain
the
splendor
and
dignity
of
a
royal
crown
in
the
mind
of
the
father
this
ambition
was
combined
with
schemes
of
conquest
in
the
son
it
was
merely
a
desire
for
personal
and
dynastic
aggrandizement
it
is
certain
that
the
origin
of
such
a
state
as
the
kingdom
of
prussia
can
be
attributed
to
no
other
cause
than
to
so
remarkable
a
succession
of
so
many
glorious
princes
frederick
was
resolved
to
appear
among
them
distinguished
by
some
important
service
rendered
to
his
house
frederick
i
said
he
gained
the
electoral
dignity
for
our
house
and
i
as
frederick
iii
would
fain
give
it
royal
rank
according
to
the
old
saying
that
third
time
makes
perfect
it
was
in
the
year
that
he
first
began
seriously
to
act
upon
the
project
of
obtaining
a
royal
crown
he
had
just
led
some
troops
to
crossen
which
were
to
serve
the
emperor
against
the
turks
but
the
imperial
ministers
neither
arrived
in
due
time
to
receive
them
nor
when
at
length
they
made
their
appearance
did
they
bring
with
them
the
grants
of
certain
privileges
and
expectancies
which
frederick
had
looked
for
in
disgust
at
being
treated
with
neglect
at
the
very
moment
in
which
he
was
rendering
the
emperor
a
very
essential
service
he
went
to
carlsbad
where
he
was
joined
by
his
ambassador
to
vienna
who
had
been
commissioned
by
the
imperial
ministers
to
apologize
for
the
omissions
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
in
concert
with
his
ambassador
and
his
prime
minister
dankelmann
the
brother
of
the
former
frederick
resolved
to
make
public
the
wish
which
he
had
hitherto
entertained
in
secret
or
only
now
and
then
let
drop
into
conversation
the
ambassador
accordingly
received
instruction
to
present
a
formal
memorial
at
that
time
however
nothing
could
be
done
the
count
of
ottingen
who
was
hostile
to
the
protestant
princes
was
once
more
in
favor
at
the
court
of
vienna
the
peril
from
without
had
ceased
to
be
pressing
and
coalition
had
begun
gradually
to
dissolve
the
only
result
of
the
negotiation
was
a
vague
and
general
promise
the
elector
did
not
however
give
up
his
idea
the
elevation
of
the
saxon
house
to
the
throne
of
poland
the
prospect
enjoyed
by
his
near
kindred
of
hanover
of
succeeding
to
that
of
england
and
perhaps
the
very
difficulties
and
opposition
which
he
encountered
tended
to
sharpen
his
appetite
for
a
royal
crown
the
misunderstandings
which
arose
among
the
great
european
powers
out
of
the
approaching
vacancy
of
the
throne
of
spain
soon
afforded
him
an
excellent
opportunity
of
renewing
his
demands
the
court
of
vienna
was
not
to
be
moved
by
past
but
by
future
services
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
enter
into
the
details
of
the
negotiation
on
this
subject
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
prince
devoted
his
whole
energy
to
it
and
never
lost
sight
of
any
advantage
afforded
by
his
position
suggestions
of
the
most
exaggerated
kind
were
made
to
him
for
instance
that
he
should
lay
his
claims
before
the
pope
who
possessed
the
power
of
granting
the
royal
dignity
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
the
emperor
while
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
more
zealous
protestants
among
his
ministers
were
anxious
to
avoid
even
that
degree
of
approach
toward
the
catholic
element
implied
in
a
closer
alliance
with
the
emperor
and
desired
that
the
elector
elevation
in
rank
should
be
made
to
depend
upon
some
new
and
important
acquisition
of
territory
such
for
example
as
that
of
polish
prussia
which
then
seemed
neither
difficult
nor
improbable
frederick
however
persisted
in
the
opinion
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
royal
dignity
merely
on
acccount
of
his
sovereign
dukedom
of
prussia
and
that
the
recognition
of
the
emperor
was
the
most
important
step
in
the
affair
he
was
convinced
that
when
the
emperor
had
once
got
possession
of
the
spanish
inheritance
or
concluded
a
treaty
upon
the
subject
nothing
more
was
to
be
hoped
from
him
but
that
now
while
the
elector
of
brandenburg
was
able
to
render
him
as
effectual
assistance
as
any
power
in
europe
some
advantage
might
be
wrung
from
him
in
return
influenced
by
these
considerations
he
resolved
to
lay
proposals
before
the
emperor
which
acquired
uncommon
significance
from
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
made
at
that
very
time
in
march
england
holland
and
france
had
just
concluded
a
treaty
for
the
division
of
the
spanish
monarchy
in
which
the
right
of
inheritance
of
austria
was
utterly
disregarded
in
order
to
preserve
the
european
balance
of
power
spain
and
the
indies
were
indeed
to
fall
to
the
share
of
the
young
archduke
charles
but
he
was
to
be
deprived
of
naples
sicily
and
milan
and
should
the
archduke
ever
become
emperor
of
germany
spain
and
the
indies
were
to
be
given
up
to
another
prince
whose
claims
were
far
inferior
to
his
this
treaty
was
received
with
disgust
and
indignation
at
vienna
where
the
assistance
of
heaven
was
solemnly
implored
and
its
interference
in
the
affair
fully
expected
at
this
juncture
brandenburg
offered
to
make
common
cause
with
the
emperor
not
alone
against
france
but
even
against
england
and
holland
with
whom
it
was
otherwise
closely
allied
the
only
recompense
was
to
be
the
concession
of
royal
rank
to
the
elector
the
principal
opposition
to
this
offer
arose
out
of
the
difference
of
confessions
it
is
also
quite
true
that
the
emperor
confessor
pater
wolf
to
whom
the
elector
wrote
with
his
own
hand
helped
to
overrule
it
and
took
part
in
the
negotiations
but
the
determining
cause
was
without
doubt
the
political
state
of
affairs
a
concession
which
involved
no
loss
could
not
surely
be
thought
too
high
a
price
to
pay
for
the
help
of
the
most
warlike
of
the
german
powers
on
so
important
an
occasion
in
the
month
of
july
at
the
great
conference
the
imperial
ministers
came
to
the
resolution
that
the
wishes
of
the
elector
should
be
complied
with
and
as
soon
as
the
conditions
could
be
determined
involving
the
closest
alliance
both
for
the
war
and
for
the
affairs
of
the
empire
the
treaty
was
signed
on
november
on
the
side
of
brandenburg
the
utmost
care
was
taken
not
to
admit
a
word
which
might
imply
anything
further
than
the
assent
and
concurrence
of
the
emperor
the
elector
affected
to
derive
from
his
own
power
alone
the
right
of
assuming
the
royal
crown
he
would
nevertheless
have
encountered
much
ulnpleasant
oppositions
in
other
quarters
but
for
the
concurrences
which
very
opportunely
for
him
now
took
place
in
france
and
spain
the
last
spanish
sovereign
of
the
line
of
hapsburg
had
died
in
the
mean
time
and
on
opening
his
will
it
was
found
to
be
entirely
in
favor
of
the
king
of
france
whose
grandson
was
appointed
heir
to
the
whole
spanish
monarchy
hereupon
louis
xiv
broke
the
treaty
of
partition
which
had
recently
been
made
under
his
own
influence
and
determined
to
seize
the
greater
advantage
and
to
accept
the
inheritance
this
naturally
roused
all
the
antipathies
entertained
by
other
nations
against
france
and
england
and
holland
went
over
to
the
side
of
austria
the
opposition
which
these
two
powers
had
offered
to
the
erection
of
a
new
throne
was
now
silenced
and
they
beheld
a
common
interest
in
the
elevation
of
the
house
of
brandenburg
frederick
had
moreover
already
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
king
of
poland
though
not
with
the
republic
so
that
thus
supported
and
with
the
consent
of
all
his
old
allies
he
could
now
celebrate
the
splendid
coronation
for
which
his
heart
had
so
long
panted
we
will
not
describe
here
the
ceremonial
of
january
to
our
taste
it
seems
overcharged
when
we
read
the
account
of
it
but
there
is
a
certain
grandeur
in
the
idea
of
the
sovereign
grasping
the
crown
with
his
own
hand
and
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
of
anointing
after
instead
of
before
the
crowning
by
two
priests
promoted
to
bishoprics
for
the
occasion
was
a
protest
against
the
dependence
of
the
temporal
on
the
spiritual
power
such
as
perhaps
never
was
made
at
any
other
coronation
either
before
or
since
the
spiritual
element
showed
itself
in
the
only
attitude
of
authority
left
to
it
in
protestant
states
that
of
teaching
and
exhortation
the
provost
of
berlin
demonstrated
from
the
examples
of
christ
and
of
david
that
the
government
of
kings
must
be
carried
on
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
their
people
he
lays
down
as
the
first
principle
that
all
rulers
should
bear
in
mind
they
have
come
into
the
world
for
the
sake
of
their
subjects
and
not
their
subjects
for
the
sake
of
them
finally
he
exhorts
all
his
hearers
to
pray
to
god
that
he
will
deeply
impress
this
conviction
upon
the
hearts
of
all
sovereign
princes
the
institution
of
the
order
of
the
black
eagle
which
immediately
preceded
the
coronation
was
likewise
symbolical
of
the
duties
of
royalty
the
words
on
the
insignia
of
the
order
according
to
lamberty
who
suggested
them
contain
the
definition
of
a
good
government
under
which
all
men
alike
good
as
well
as
bad
are
rewarded
according
to
their
several
deserts
the
laurel
and
the
lightning
denote
reward
and
punishment
the
conception
at
least
is
truly
royal
leibnitz
who
was
at
that
time
closely
connected
with
the
court
and
who
busied
himself
very
much
with
this
affair
justly
observes
that
nothing
is
complete
without
a
name
and
that
although
the
elector
did
already
possess
every
royal
attribute
he
became
truly
a
king
only
by
being
called
so
although
the
new
dignity
rested
only
on
the
possession
of
prussia
all
the
other
provinces
were
included
in
the
rank
and
title
those
belonging
to
the
german
empire
were
thus
in
a
manner
chosen
out
from
among
the
other
german
states
and
united
into
a
new
whole
though
at
the
same
time
care
was
taken
in
other
respects
to
keep
up
the
ancient
connection
with
the
empire
thus
we
see
that
the
elevation
of
the
elector
to
a
royal
title
was
an
important
nay
even
a
necessary
impulse
to
the
progress
of
prussia
which
we
can
not
even
in
thought
separate
from
the
whole
combination
of
events
the
name
of
prussia
now
became
inseparable
from
an
idea
of
military
power
and
glory
which
was
increased
by
splendid
feats
of
arms
such
as
those
which
we
have
already
enumerated

footnote
translated
from
the
russian
by
lady
mary
loyd
so
radical
and
so
vigorous
were
the
changes
made
by
peter
the
great
in
russia
that
they
roused
the
opposition
of
almost
the
entire
nation
moscow
the
ancient
capital
was
the
chief
seat
of
this
protesting
conservatism
and
peter
resolved
to
teach
his
opponents
how
determined
he
was
in
his
course
and
how
helpless
they
were
against
his
absolute
power
formed
the
tremendous
project
of
building
a
wholly
new
capital
one
where
no
voice
could
be
raised
against
him
where
no
traditions
should
environ
him
he
chose
an
icy
desert
plain
looking
out
toward
the
waters
which
led
to
that
western
europe
which
he
meant
to
imitate
if
not
to
conquer
no
other
man
one
is
almost
tempted
to
say
no
sane
man
would
have
ventured
to
erect
a
capital
city
in
such
an
impossible
place
and
on
the
very
frontier
of
his
dominions
that
peter
not
only
dared
but
succeeded
though
at
an
almost
immeasurable
cost
makes
the
creation
of
the
great
metropolis
petersburg
one
of
the
most
remarkable
events
of
history
it
was
the
chances
of
the
great
northern
war
that
led
peter
to
petersburg
when
he
first
threw
down
the
gauntlet
to
sweden
he
turned
his
eyes
on
livonia
on
narva
and
riga
but
livonia
was
so
well
defended
that
he
was
driven
northward
toward
ingria
he
moved
thither
grudgingly
sending
in
the
first
instance
apraxin
who
turned
the
easily
conquered
province
into
a
desert
it
was
not
for
some
time
and
gropingly
as
it
were
that
the
young
sovereign
began
to
see
his
way
and
finally
turned
his
attention
and
his
longings
to
the
mouth
of
the
neva
in
former
years
gustavus
adolphus
had
realized
the
strategical
importance
of
a
position
which
his
successor
charles
xii
did
not
deem
worthy
of
consideration
and
had
himself
studied
all
its
approaches
peter
not
only
took
it
to
be
valuable
from
the
military
and
commercial
point
of
view
he
also
found
it
most
attractive
and
would
fain
have
never
left
it
he
was
more
at
home
there
than
anywhere
else
and
the
historical
legends
according
to
which
it
was
true
russian
ground
filled
him
with
emotion
no
one
knows
what
inspired
this
fondness
on
his
part
it
may
have
been
the
vague
resemblance
of
the
marshy
flats
to
the
lowlands
of
holland
it
may
have
been
the
stirring
of
some
ancestral
instinct
according
to
a
legend
accepted
by
nestor
it
was
by
the
mouth
of
the
neva
that
the
earliest
norman
conquerors
of
the
country
passed
on
their
journeys
across
the
varegian
sea
own
and
so
to
rome
peter
would
seem
to
have
desired
to
take
up
the
thread
of
that
tradition
nine
centuries
old
and
the
story
of
his
own
foundation
of
the
town
has
become
legendary
and
epic
one
popular
description
represents
him
as
snatching
a
halberd
from
one
of
his
soldiers
cutting
two
strips
of
turf
and
laying
them
crosswise
with
the
words
here
there
shall
be
a
town
were
evidently
lacking
and
sods
had
to
take
their
place
then
dropping
the
halberd
he
seized
a
spade
and
began
the
first
embankment
at
that
moment
an
eagle
appeared
hovering
over
the
head
it
was
struck
by
a
shot
from
a
musket
peter
took
the
wounded
bird
set
it
on
his
wrist
and
departed
in
a
boat
to
inspect
the
neighborhood
this
occurred
on
may
history
adds
that
the
swedish
prisoners
employed
on
the
work
died
in
thousands
the
most
indispensable
tools
were
lacking
there
were
no
wheelbarrows
and
the
earth
was
carried
in
the
corners
of
men
clothing
a
wooden
fort
was
first
built
on
the
island
bearing
the
finnish
name
of
hare
island
this
was
the
future
citadel
of
peter
and
paul
then
came
a
wooden
church
and
the
modest
cottage
which
was
to
be
peter
first
palace
near
these
the
following
year
there
rose
a
lutheran
church
ultimately
removed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
river
into
the
liteinaia
quarter
and
also
a
tavern
the
famous
inn
of
the
four
frigates
which
did
duty
as
a
town
hall
for
a
long
time
before
it
became
a
place
of
diplomatic
meeting
then
the
cluster
of
modest
buildings
was
augmented
by
the
erection
of
a
bazaar
the
czar
collaborators
gathered
round
him
in
cottages
much
like
his
own
and
the
existence
of
petersburg
became
an
accomplished
fact
but
up
to
the
time
of
the
battle
of
poltava
peter
never
thought
of
making
petersburg
his
capital
it
was
enough
for
him
to
feel
he
had
a
fortress
and
a
port
he
was
not
sufficiently
sure
of
his
mastery
over
the
neighboring
countries
not
certain
enough
of
being
able
to
retain
his
conquest
to
desire
to
make
it
the
centre
of
his
government
and
his
own
permanent
residence
this
idea
was
not
definitely
accepted
till
after
his
great
victory
his
final
decision
has
been
bitterly
criticised
especially
by
foreign
historians
it
has
been
severely
judged
and
remorselessly
condemned
before
expressing
any
opinion
of
my
own
on
the
subject
i
should
like
to
sum
up
the
considerations
which
have
been
put
forward
to
support
this
unfavorable
verdict
the
great
victory
we
are
told
diminished
the
strategic
importance
of
petersburg
and
almost
entirely
extinguished
its
value
as
a
port
while
its
erection
into
the
capital
city
of
the
empire
was
never
anything
but
madness
peter
being
now
the
indisputable
master
of
the
baltic
shores
had
nothing
to
fear
from
any
swedish
attack
in
the
gulf
of
finland
before
any
attempt
in
that
direction
the
swedes
were
certain
to
try
to
recover
narva
or
riga
if
in
later
years
they
turned
their
eyes
to
petersburg
it
was
only
because
that
town
had
acquired
undue
and
unmerited
political
importance
it
was
easy
of
attack
and
difficult
to
defend
there
was
no
possibility
of
concentrating
any
large
number
of
troops
there
for
the
whole
country
forty
leagues
round
was
a
barren
desert
in
catharine
ii
complained
that
her
capital
was
too
near
the
swedish
frontier
and
too
much
exposed
to
sudden
movements
such
as
that
which
gustavus
iii
very
nearly
succeeded
in
carrying
out
here
we
have
the
military
side
of
the
question
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
petersburg
we
are
assured
did
command
a
valuable
system
of
river
communication
but
that
commanded
by
riga
was
far
superior
the
livonian
esthonian
and
courland
ports
of
riga
libau
and
revel
all
at
an
equal
distance
from
petersburg
and
moscow
and
far
less
removed
from
the
great
german
commercial
centres
enjoyed
a
superior
climate
and
were
subsequent
to
the
conquest
of
the
provinces
the
natural
points
of
contact
between
russia
and
the
west
an
eloquent
proof
of
this
fact
may
be
observed
nowadays
in
the
constant
increase
of
their
commerce
and
the
corresponding
decrease
of
that
of
petersburg
which
has
been
artificially
developed
and
fostered
besides
this
the
port
of
petersburg
during
the
lifetime
of
its
founder
never
was
anything
but
a
mere
project
peter
ships
were
moved
from
kronslot
to
kronstadt
between
petersburg
and
kronstadt
the
neva
was
not
in
those
days
more
than
eight
feet
deep
and
manstein
tells
us
that
all
ships
built
at
petersburg
had
to
be
dragged
by
means
of
machines
fitted
with
cables
to
kronstadt
where
they
received
their
guns
once
these
had
been
taken
on
board
the
vessels
could
not
get
upstream
again
the
port
of
kronstadt
was
closed
by
ice
for
six
months
out
of
the
twelve
and
lay
in
such
a
position
that
no
could
leave
it
unless
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
there
was
so
little
salt
in
its
waters
that
the
ship
timbers
rotted
in
a
very
short
time
and
besides
there
were
no
oaks
in
the
surrounding
forests
and
all
such
timber
had
to
be
brought
from
kasan
peter
was
so
well
aware
of
all
these
drawbacks
that
he
sought
and
found
a
more
convenient
spot
for
his
shipbuilding
yards
at
rogerwick
in
esthonia
four
leagues
from
revel
but
here
he
found
difficulty
in
protecting
the
anchorage
from
the
effects
of
hurricanes
and
from
the
insults
of
his
enemies
he
hoped
to
insure
this
by
means
of
two
piers
built
on
wooden
caissons
filled
with
stones
he
thinned
the
forests
of
livonia
and
esthonia
to
construct
it
and
finally
the
winds
and
the
waves
having
carried
everything
away
twice
over
the
work
was
utterly
abandoned
on
the
other
hand
and
from
the
very
outset
the
commercial
activity
of
petersburg
was
hampered
by
the
fact
that
it
was
the
czar
capital
the
presence
of
the
court
made
living
dear
and
the
consequent
expense
of
labor
was
a
heavy
drawback
to
the
export
trade
which
by
its
nature
called
for
a
good
deal
of
manual
exertion
according
to
a
dutch
resident
of
that
period
a
wooden
cottage
very
inferior
to
that
inhabited
by
a
peasant
in
the
low
countries
cost
from
eight
hundred
to
one
thousand
florins
a
year
at
petersburg
a
shopkeeper
at
archangel
could
live
comfortably
on
a
quarter
of
that
sum
the
cost
of
transport
which
amounted
to
between
nine
and
ten
copecks
a
pood
pounds
between
moscow
and
archangel
five
to
six
between
yaroslaff
and
archangel
and
three
or
four
between
vologda
and
archangel
came
to
eighteen
twenty
and
thirty
copecks
a
pood
in
the
case
of
merchandise
sent
from
any
of
these
places
to
petersburg
this
accounts
for
the
opposition
of
the
foreign
merchants
at
archangel
to
the
request
that
they
should
remove
to
petersburg
peter
settled
the
matter
in
characteristic
fashion
by
forbidding
any
trade
in
hemp
flax
leather
or
corn
to
pass
through
archangel
this
rule
though
somewhat
slackened
in
at
the
request
of
the
of
holland
remained
in
force
during
the
great
czar
reign
in
hemp
and
some
other
articles
of
commerce
were
allowed
free
entrance
into
the
port
of
archangel
but
only
on
condition
that
of
all
exports
should
be
sent
to
petersburg
this
puts
the
case
from
the
maritime
and
commercial
point
of
view
as
a
capital
city
petersburg
we
are
told
again
was
on
the
banks
of
the
neva
not
only
for
the
reasons
already
given
but
for
others
geographical
ethnical
and
climatic
which
exist
even
in
the
present
day
and
which
make
its
selection
an
outrage
on
was
it
not
we
are
asked
a
most
extraordinary
whim
which
induced
a
russian
to
found
the
capital
of
his
slavonic
empire
among
the
finns
against
the
swedes
to
centralize
the
administration
of
a
huge
extent
of
country
in
its
remotest
corner
to
retire
from
poland
and
germany
on
the
plea
of
drawing
nearer
to
europe
and
to
force
everyone
about
him
officials
court
and
diplomatic
corps
to
inhabit
one
of
the
most
inhospitable
spots
under
one
of
the
least
clement
skies
he
could
possibly
have
discovered
the
whole
place
was
a
marsh
the
finnish
word
neva
means
mud
the
sole
inhabitants
of
the
neighboring
forests
were
packs
of
wolves
in
during
a
winter
night
two
sentries
posted
before
the
were
devoured
even
nowadays
the
traveller
once
outside
the
town
plunges
into
a
desert
far
away
in
every
direction
the
great
plain
stretches
not
a
steeple
not
a
tree
not
a
head
of
cattle
not
a
sign
of
life
whether
human
or
animal
there
is
no
pasturage
no
possibility
of
cultivation
fruit
vegetables
and
even
corn
are
all
brought
from
a
distance
the
ground
is
in
a
sort
of
intermediate
condition
between
the
sea
and
up
to
catharine
reign
inundations
were
chronic
in
their
occurrence
on
september
peter
drew
from
his
pocket
the
measure
he
always
carried
about
him
and
convinced
himself
that
there
were
inches
of
water
above
the
floors
of
his
cottage
in
all
directions
he
saw
men
women
and
children
clinging
to
the
wreckage
of
buildings
which
was
being
carried
down
the
river
he
described
his
impressions
in
a
letter
to
menshikoff
dated
from
paradise
and
declared
it
was
extremely
amusing
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
found
many
persons
to
share
his
delight
communications
with
the
town
now
rendered
easy
by
railways
were
in
those
days
not
only
difficult
but
dangerous
campredon
when
he
went
from
moscow
to
petersburg
in
april
spent
twelve
hundred
rubles
he
lost
part
of
his
luggage
eight
of
his
horses
were
drowned
and
after
having
travelled
for
four
weeks
he
reached
his
destination
very
peter
himself
who
arrived
before
the
french
diplomat
had
been
obliged
to
ride
part
of
the
way
and
to
swim
his
horse
across
the
rivers
but
in
spite
of
all
these
considerations
the
importance
of
which
i
am
far
from
denying
i
am
inclined
to
think
peter
choice
a
wise
one
nobody
can
wonder
that
the
idea
of
retaining
moscow
as
his
capital
was
most
repugnant
to
him
the
existence
of
his
work
in
those
hostile
surroundings
in
a
place
which
to
this
day
has
remained
obstinately
reactionary
could
never
have
been
anything
but
precarious
and
uncertain
it
must
after
his
death
at
least
if
not
during
his
life
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
those
popular
insurrections
before
which
the
sovereign
power
as
established
in
the
kremlin
had
already
so
frequently
bowed
when
peter
carried
muscovy
out
of
her
former
existence
and
beyond
her
ancient
frontiers
he
was
logically
forced
to
treat
the
seat
of
his
government
in
the
same
manner
his
new
undertaking
resembled
both
in
aspect
and
character
a
marching
and
fighting
formation
directed
toward
the
west
the
leader
place
and
that
of
his
chief
residence
was
naturally
indicated
at
the
head
of
his
column
this
once
granted
and
the
principle
of
the
translation
of
the
capital
to
the
western
extremity

acquired

the
advantages
offered
by

appear
to
me
to
outweigh
all
the
drawbacks
previously

the

at
that
period
virgin

sparsely
inhabited
by
a
finnish
population
possessing
neither
cohesion
nor
historical
consistency
and
consequently
docile
and
easily
assimilated
everywhere
else
all
along
the
baltic

in
esthonia
in
carelia
and
in
courland
though
the
swedes
might
be
driven

remained
firmly
settled
the

of
their
native
country

of
the
springs
of

enduing
them
with
an
invincible
power
of

riga
in
the
present
day
after
nearly
two
centuries
of
russian
government
is
a
thoroughly
german
town
in
petersburg
russia
as
a
country
became
european
and
cosmopolitan
but
the
city
itself
is
essentially
russian
and
the
finnish
element
in
its
neighborhood
counts
for
nothing
in
this
matter
though
peter
may
not
have
clearly
felt
and
thought
it
out
he
was
actuated
by
the
mighty
and
unerring
instinct
of
his
genius
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
here
as
in
everything
else
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
whim
and
perhaps
some
childish
desire
to
ape
amsterdam
i
will
even
go
further
and
acknowledge
that
the
manner
in
which
he
carried
out
his
plan
was
anything
but
reasonable
two
hundred
thousand
laborers
we
are
told
died
during
the
construction
of
the
new
city
and
the
russian
nobles
ruined
themselves
to
build
palaces
which
soon
fell
out
of
occupation
but
an
abyss
was
opened
between
the
past
the
reformer
had
doomed
and
the
future
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
and
the
national
life
thus
violently
forced
into
a
new
channel
was
stamped
superficially
at
first
but
more
and
more
deeply
by
degrees
with
the
western
and
european
character
he
desired
to
impart
moscow
down
to
the
present
day
has
preserved
a
religious
almost
a
monastic
air
at
every
street
corner
chapels

the
and
the
local
population
even
at
its
busiest
crosses
itself
and
bends
as
it
passes
before
the
sacred
pictures
which
rouse
its
devotion
at
every
turn
petersburg
from
the
very
earliest
days
presented
a
different
and
quite
a
secular
appearance
at
moscow
no
public
performance
of
profane
music
was
permitted
at
petersburg
the
czar
german
musicians
played
every
day
on
the
balcony
of
his
tavern
toward
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
new
city
boasted
a
french
theatre
and
an
italian
opera
and
schloezer
noted
that
divine
service
was
performed
in
fourteen
languages
modern
russia
governed
educated
to
a
certain
extent
intellectually
speaking
emancipated
and
relatively
liberal
could
not
have
come
into
existence
nor
grown
in
stature
elsewhere
and
to
conclude
peter
was
able
to
effect
this
singular
change
without
doing
too
great
violence
to
the
historical
traditions
of
his
country
from
the
earliest
days
of
russian
history
the
capital
had
been
removed
from
place
to
place
from
novgorod
to
kiev
from
kiev
to
vladimir
from
vladimir
to
moscow
this
phenomenon
was
the
consequence
of
the
immense
area
of
the
national
territory
and
the
want
of
consistency
in
the
elements
of
the
national
life
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
an
evolution
which
lasted
centuries
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
disjointed
scattered
and
floating
forces
of
ancient
russia
perpetually
changed
its
place
thus
the
creation
of
petersburg
was
nothing
but
the
working
out
of
a
problem
in
dynamics
the
struggle
with
sweden
the
conquest
of
the
baltic
provinces
and
the
yet
more
important
conquest
of
a
position
in
the
european
world
naturally
turned
the
whole
current
of
the
national
energies
and
life
in
that
direction
peter
desired
to
perpetuate
this
course
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
acted
wisely
battle
of
blenheim
curbing
of
louis
xiv
sir
edward
shepherd
creasy
among
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
that
of
blenheim
is
regarded
by
historians
as
one
of
the
most
in
results
the
decisive
blow
struck
at
blenheim
says
alison
resounded
through
every
part
of
europe
it
at
once
destroyed
the
vast
fabric
of
power
which
it
had
taken
louis
xiv
so
long
to
construct
and
creasy
himself
elsewhere
declares
had
it
not
been
for
blenheim
all
europe
might
at
this
day
suffer
under
the
effect
of
french
conquests
resembling
those
of
alexander
in
extent
and
those
of
the
romans
in
durability
it
was
the
first
great
battle
in
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
which
was
carried
on
mainly
in
italy
the
netherlands
and
germany
this
war
followed
closely
upon
the
war
of
the
palatinate
which
ended
with
the
treaty
of
ryswick
in
to
this
peace
louis
xiv
of
france
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
europe
who
in
spite
of
his
brutal
conduct
of
the
war
had
really
been
a
loser
by
it
gave
his
consent
among
the
concessions
made
by
him
was
his
recognition
much
against
his
own
interest
of
william
iii
as
the
rightful
king
of
england
louis
gave
his
consent
to
the
treaty
of
ryswick
partly
because
of
his
interest
in
the
question
of
the
spanish
succession
charles
ii
of
spain
last
of
the
hapsburg
line
in
that
country
was
childless
and
there
were
three
claimants
for
the
throne
namely
philip
of
anjou
grandson
of
louis
xiv
the
electoral
prince
of
bavaria
and
charles
son
of
leopold
i
of
germany
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
the
real
stake
was
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
at
last
after
much
wrangling
and
intrigue
among
the
courts
charles
ii
bequeathed
his
throne
to
the
bavarian
prince
whose
death
in
left
europe
still
divided
over
the
succession
finally
louis
xiv
completely
won
charles
ii
to
his
side
and
philip
of
anjou
was
named
in
charles
will
as
his
heir
louis
accepted
for
philip
who
was
crowned
at
madrid
in
as
philip
v
and
europe
was
stirred
to
wrath
by
the
greed
of
the
already
too
powerful
french
king
turning
now
upon
england
louis
in
violation
of
the
treaty
of
ryswick
declared
the
son
of
the
exiled
james
ii
rightful
king
of
that
country
the
result
of
louis
acts
was
the
grand
alliance
of
the
hague
against
france
formed
between
england
holland
prussia
the
holy
roman
empire
portugal
and
savoy
on
the
side
of
the
allies
in
the
war
that
followed
the
great
generals
were
the
english
duke
of
marlborough
prince
eugene
of
savoy
and
hensius
pensioner
of
holland
france
had
lost
her
best
generals
by
death
and
louis
was
compelled
to
rely
upon
inferior
men
as
leaders
of
his
army
war
was
formally
declared
against
france
by
the
allies
may
the
early
operations
were
carried
on
in
flanders
in
germany
on
the
upper
rhine
and
in
northern
italy
marlborough
headed
the
allied
troops
in
flanders
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
and
took
some
towns
from
the
enemy
but
nothing
decisive
occurred
nor
did
any
actions
of
importance
take
place
during
this
period
between
the
rival
armies
in
italy
but
in
the
centre
of
that
line
from
north
to
south
from
the
mouth
of
the
schelde
to
the
mouth
of
the
po
along
which
the
war
was
carried
on
the
generals
of
louis
xiv
acquired
advantages
in
which
threatened
one
chief
member
of
the
grand
alliance
with
utter
destruction
france
had
obtained
the
important
assistance
of
bavaria
as
her
confederate
in
the
war
the
elector
of
this
powerful
german
state
made
himself
master
of
the
strong
fortress
of
ulm
and
opened
a
communication
with
the
french
armies
on
the
upper
rhine
by
this
junction
the
troops
of
louis
were
enabled
to
assail
the
emperor
in
the
very
heart
of
germany
in
the
autumn
of
the
combined
armies
of
the
elector
and
french
king
completely
defeated
the
imperialists
in
bavaria
and
in
the
following
winter
they
made
themselves
masters
of
the
important
cities
of
augsburg
and
passau
meanwhile
the
french
army
of
the
upper
rhine
and
moselle
had
beaten
the
allied
armies
opposed
to
them
and
taken
treves
and
landau
at
the
same
time
the
discontents
in
hungary
with
austria
again
broke
out
into
open
insurrection
so
as
to
distract
the
attention
and
complete
the
terror
of
the
emperor
and
his
council
at
vienna
louis
xiv
ordered
the
next
campaign
to
be
commenced
by
his
troops
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
and
with
a
boldness
of
enterprise
such
as
even
military
schemes
have
seldom
equalled
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
line
of
the
war
in
the
netherlands
the
french
armies
were
to
act
only
on
the
defensive
the
fortresses
in
the
hands
of
the
french
there
were
so
many
and
strong
that
no
serious
impression
seemed
likely
to
be
made
by
the
allies
on
the
french
frontier
in
that
quarter
during
one
campaign
and
that
one
campaign
was
to
give
france
such
triumphs
elsewhere
as
would
it
was
hoped
determine
the
war
large
detachments
were
therefore
to
be
made
from
the
french
force
in
flanders
and
they
were
to
be
led
by
marshal
villeroy
to
the
moselle
and
upper
rhine
the
french
army
already
in
the
neighborhood
of
those
rivers
was
to
march
under
marshal
tallard
through
the
black
forest
and
join
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
the
french
troops
that
were
already
with
the
elector
under
marshal
marsin
meanwhile
the
french
army
of
italy
was
to
advance
through
the
tyrol
into
austria
and
the
whole
forces
were
to
combine
between
the
danube
and
the
inn
a
strong
body
of
troops
was
to
be
despatched
into
hungary
to
assist
and
organize
the
insurgents
in
that
kingdom
and
the
french
grand
army
of
the
danube
was
then
in
collected
and
irresistible
might
to
march
upon
vienna
and
dictate
terms
of
peace
to
the
emperor
high
military
genius
was
shown
in
the
formation
of
this
plan
but
it
was
met
and
baffled
by
a
genius
higher
still
marlborough
had
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
the
progress
of
the
french
arms
on
the
rhine
and
in
bavaria
and
he
saw
the
futility
of
carrying
on
a
war
of
posts
and
sieges
in
flanders
while
to
the
empire
were
being
dealt
on
the
danube
he
resolved
therefore
to
let
the
war
in
flanders
languish
for
a
year
while
he
moved
with
all
the
disposable
forces
that
he
could
collect
to
the
central
scenes
of
decisive
operations
such
a
march
was
in
itself
difficult
but
marlborough
had
in
the
first
instance
to
overcome
the
still
greater
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
consent
and
cheerful
cooperation
of
the
allies
especially
of
the
dutch
whose
frontier
it
was
proposed
thus
to
deprive
of
the
larger
part
of
the
force
which
had
hitherto
been
its
protection
fortunately
among
the
many
slothful
the
many
foolish
the
many
timid
and
the
not
few
treacherous
rulers
statesmen
and
generals
of
different
nations
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
there
were
two
men
eminent
both
in
ability
and
integrity
who
entered
fully
into
marlborough
projects
and
who
from
the
stations
which
they
occupied
were
enabled
materially
to
forward
them
one
of
these
was
the
dutch
statesman
heinsius
who
had
been
the
cordial
supporter
of
king
william
and
who
now
with
equal
zeal
and
good
faith
supported
marlborough
in
the
councils
of
the
allies
the
other
was
the
celebrated
general
prince
eugene
whom
the
austrian
cabinet
had
recalled
from
the
italian
frontier
to
take
the
command
of
one
of
the
emperor
armies
in
germany
to
these
two
great
men
and
a
few
more
marlborough
communicated
his
plan
freely
and
unreservedly
but
to
the
general
councils
of
his
allies
he
only
disclosed
part
of
his
daring
scheme
he
proposed
to
the
dutch
that
he
should
march
from
flanders
to
the
upper
rhine
and
moselle
with
the
british
troops
and
part
of
the
foreign
auxiliaries
and
commence
vigorous
operations
against
the
french
armies
in
that
quarter
while
general
auverquerque
with
the
dutch
and
the
remainder
of
the
auxiliaries
maintained
a
defensive
war
in
the
netherlands
having
with
difficulty
obtained
the
consent
of
the
dutch
to
this
portion
of
his
project
he
exercised
the
same
diplomatic
zeal
with
the
same
success
in
urging
the
king
of
prussia
and
other
princes
of
the
empire
to
increase
the
number
of
the
troops
which
they
supplied
and
to
post
them
in
places
convenient
for
his
own
intended
movements
marlborough
commenced
his
celebrated
march
on
may
the
army
which
he
was
to
lead
had
been
assembled
by
his
brother
general
churchill
at
bedburg
not
far
from
maestricht
on
the
meuse
it
included
sixteen
thousand
english
troops
and
consisted
of
battalions
of
foot
and
squadrons
of
horse
marlborough
was
to
collect
and
join
with
him
on
his
march
the
troops
of
prussia
luneburg
and
hesse
quartered
on
the
rhine
and
eleven
dutch
battalions
that
were
stationed
at
rothweil
he
had
only
marched
a
single
day
when
the
series
of
interruptions
complaints
and
requisitions
from
the
other
leaders
of
the
allies
began
to
which
he
seemed
subjected
throughout
his
enterprise
and
which
would
have
caused
its
failure
in
the
hands
of
anyone
not
gifted
with
the
firmness
and
the
exquisite
temper
of
marlborough
one
specimen
of
these
annoyances
and
of
marlborough
mode
of
dealing
with
them
may
suffice
on
his
encamping
at
kupen
on
the
he
received
an
express
from
auverquerque
pressing
him
to
halt
because
villeroy
who
commanded
the
french
army
in
flanders
had
quitted
the
lines
which
he
had
been
occupying
and
crossed
the
meuse
at
namur
with
battalions
and
squadrons
and
was
threatening
the
town
of
huy
at
the
same
time
marlborough
received
letters
from
the
margrave
of
baden
and
count
wratislaw
who
commanded
the
imperialist
forces
at
stollhoffen
near
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
stating
that
tallard
had
made
a
movement
as
if
intending
to
cross
the
rhine
and
urging
him
to
hasten
his
march
toward
the
lines
of
stollhoffen
marlborough
was
not
diverted
by
these
applications
from
the
prosecution
of
his
grand
design
conscious
that
the
army
of
villeroy
would
be
too
much
reduced
to
undertake
offensive
operations
by
the
detachments
which
had
already
been
made
toward
the
rhine
and
those
which
must
follow
his
own
march
he
halted
only
a
day
to
quiet
the
alarms
of
auverquerque
to
satisfy
also
the
margrave
he
ordered
the
troops
of
hompesch
and
buelow
to
draw
toward
philippsburg
though
with
private
injunctions
not
to
proceed
beyond
a
certain
distance
he
even
exacted
a
promise
to
the
same
effect
from
count
wratislaw
who
at
this
juncture
arrived
at
the
camp
to
attend
him
during
the
whole
campaign
marlborough
reached
the
rhine
at
coblenz
where
he
crossed
that
river
and
then
marched
along
its
left
bank
to
broubach
and
mainz
his
march
though
rapid
was
admirably
conducted
so
as
to
save
the
troops
from
all
unnecessary
fatigue
ample
supplies
of
provisions
were
ready
and
the
most
perfect
discipline
was
maintained
by
degrees
marlborough
obtained
more
reinforcements
from
the
dutch
and
the
other
confederates
and
he
also
was
left
more
at
liberty
by
them
to
follow
his
own
course
indeed
before
even
a
blow
was
struck
his
enterprise
had
paralyzed
the
enemy
and
had
materially
relieved
austria
from
the
pressure
of
the
war
villeroy
with
his
detachments
from
the
french
flemish
army
was
completely
bewildered
by
marlborough
movements
and
unable
to
divine
where
it
was
that
the
english
general
meant
to
strike
his
blow
wasted
away
the
early
part
of
the
summer
between
flanders
and
the
moselle
without
effecting
anything
footnote

where
he
really
was
on
hearing
of
his
victory
at
donawert
marshal
tallard
who
commanded
thousand
french
at
strasburg
and
who
had
been
destined
by
louis
to
march
early
in
the
year
into
bavaria
thought
that
marlborough
march
along
the
rhine
was
preliminary
to
an
attack
upon
alsace
and
the
marshal
therefore
kept
his
thousand
men
back
in
order
to
protect
france
in
that
quarter
marlborough
skilfully
encouraged
his
apprehensions
by
causing
a
bridge
to
be
constructed
across
the
rhine
at
philippsburg
and
by
making
the
landgrave
of
hesse
advance
his
artillery
at
mannheim
as
if
for
a
siege
of
landau
meanwhile
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
marshal
marsin
suspecting
that
marlborough
design
might
be
what
it
really
proved
to
be
forbore
to
press
upon
the
austrians
opposed
to
them
or
to
send
troops
into
hungary
and
they
kept
back
so
as
to
secure
their
communications
with
france
thus
when
marlborough
at
the
beginning
of
june
left
the
rhine
and
marched
for
the
danube
the
numerous
hostile
armies
were
uncombined
and
unable
to
check
him
with
such
skill
and
science
says
coxe
had
this
enterprise
been
concerted
that
at
the
very
moment
when
it
assumed
a
specific
direction
the
enemy
was
no
longer
enabled
to
render
it
abortive
as
the
march
was
now
to
be
bent
toward
the
danube
notice
was
given
for
the
prussians
palatines
and
hessians
who
were
stationed
on
the
rhine
to
order
their
march
so
as
to
join
the
main
body
in
its
progress
at
the
same
time
directions
were
sent
to
accelerate
the
advance
of
the
danish
auxiliaries
who
were
marching
from
the
netherlands
crossing
the
river
neckar
marlborough
marched
in
a
southeastern
direction
to
mundelshene
where
he
had
his
first
personal
interview
with
prince
eugene
who
was
destined
to
be
his
colleague
on
so
many
glorious
fields
thence
through
a
difficult
and
dangerous
country
marlborough
continued
his
march
against
the
bavarians
whom
he
encountered
on
july
on
the
heights
of
the
schullenberg
near
donauwoerth
marlborough
stormed
their
intrenched
camp
crossed
the
danube
took
several
strong
places
in
bavaria
and
made
himself
completely
master
of
the
elector
dominions
except
the
fortified
cities
of
munich
and
augsburg
but
the
elector
army
though
defeated
at
donauwoerth
was
still
numerous
and
strong
and
at
last
marshal
tallard
when
thoroughly
apprised
of
the
real
nature
of
movements
crossed
the
rhine
and
being
suffered
through
the
supineness
of
the
german
general
at
stollhoffen
to
march
without
loss
through
the
black
forest
he
united
his
powerful
army
at
biberach
near
augsburg
with
that
of
the
elector
and
the
french
troops
under
marshal
marsin
who
had
previously
been
cooperating
with
the
bavarians
on
the
other
hand
marlborough
recrossed
the
danube
and
on
august
united
his
army
with
the
imperialist
forces
under
prince
eugene
the
combined
armies
occupied
a
position
near
hoechstaedt
a
little
higher
up
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
than
donauwoerth
the
scene
of
recent
victory
and
almost
exactly
on
the
ground
where
marshal
villars
and
the
elector
had
defeated
an
austrian
army
in
the
preceding
year
the
french
marshals
and
the
elector
were
now
in
position
a
little
further
to
the
east
between
blenheim
and
lützingen
and
with
the
little
stream
of
the
nebel
between
them
and
the
troops
of
marlborough
and
eugene
the
army
consisted
of
about
sixty
thousand
men
and
they
had
pieces
of
artillery
the
army
of
the
allies
was
about
thousand
strong
with
guns
footnote
the
battle
of
blenheim
is
called
by
the
germans
and
the
french
the
battle
of
ed
although
the
french
army
of
italy
had
been
unable
to
penetrate
into
austria
and
although
the
masterly
strategy
of
marlborough
had
hitherto
warded
off
the
destruction
with
which
the
cause
of
the
allies
seemed
menaced
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
the
peril
was
still
most
serious
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
marlborough
to
attack
the
enemy
before
villeroy
should
be
roused
into
action
there
was
nothing
to
stop
that
general
and
his
army
from
marching
into
franconia
whence
the
allies
drew
their
principal
supplies
and
besides
thus
distressing
them
he
might
by
marching
on
and
joining
his
army
to
those
of
tallard
and
the
elector
form
a
mass
which
would
overwhelm
the
force
under
marlborough
and
eugene
on
the
other
hand
the
chances
of
a
battle
seemed
perilous
and
the
fatal
consequences
of
a
defeat
were
certain
the
disadvantage
of
the
allies
in
point
of
number
was
not
very
great
but
still
it
was
not
to
be
disregarded
and
the
advantage
which
the
enemy
seemed
to
have
in
the
composition
of
their
troops
was
striking
tallard
and
marsin
had
thousand
frenchmen
under
them
all
veterans
and
all
trained
to
act
together
the
elector
own
troops
also
were
good
soldiers
marlborough
like
wellington
at
waterloo
headed
an
army
of
which
the
larger
proportion
consisted
not
of
english
but
of
men
of
many
different
nations
and
many
different
languages
he
was
also
obliged
to
be
the
assailant
in
the
action
and
thus
to
expose
his
troops
to
comparatively
heavy
loss
at
the
commencement
of
the
battle
while
the
enemy
would
fight
under
the
protection
of
the
villages
and
lines
which
they
were
actively
engaged
in
strengthening
the
consequences
of
a
defeat
of
the
confederated
army
must
have
broken
up
the
grand
alliance
and
realized
the
proudest
hopes
of
the
french
king
alison
in
his
admirable
military
history
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
has
truly
stated
the
effects
which
would
have
taken
place
if
france
had
been
successful
in
the
war
and
when
the
position
of
the
confederates
at
the
time
when
blenheim
was
fought
is
remembered
when
we
recollect
the
exhaustion
of
austria
the
menacing
insurrection
of
hungary
the
feuds
and
jealousies
of
the
german
princes
the
strength
and
activity
of
the
jacobite
party
in
england
and
the
imbecility
of
nearly
all
the
dutch
statesmen
of
the
time
and
the
weakness
of
holland
if
deprived
of
her
allies
we
may
adopt
his
words
in
speculating
on
what
would
have
ensued
if
france
had
been
victorious
in
the
battle
and
if
a
power
animated
by
the
ambition
guided
by
the
fanaticism
and
directed
by
the
ability
of
that
of
louis
xiv
had
gained
the
ascendency
in
europe
beyond
all
question
a
universal
despotic
dominion
would
have
been
established
over
the
bodies
a
cruel
spiritual
thraldom
over
the
minds
of
men
france
and
spain
united
under
bourbon
princes
and
in
a
close
family
alliance
the
empire
of
charlemagne
with
that
of
charles
v
the
power
which
revoked
the
edict
of
nantes
and
perpetrated
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
with
that
which
banished
the
moriscoes
and
established
the
inquisition
would
have
proved
irresistible
and
beyond
example
destructive
to
the
best
interests
of
mankind
the
protestants
might
have
been
driven
like
the
pagan
heathens
of
old
by
the
son
of
pépin
beyond
the
elbe
the
stuart
race
and
with
them
romish
ascendency
might
have
been
reestablished
in
england
the
fire
lighted
by
latimer
and
ridley
might
have
been
extinguished
in
blood
and
the
energy
breathed
by
religious
freedom
into
the
race
might
have
expired
the
destinies
of
the
world
would
have
been
changed
europe
instead
of
a
variety
of
independent
states
whose
mutual
hostility
kept
alive
courage
while
their
national
rivalry
stimulated
talent
would
have
sunk
into
the
slumber
attendant
on
universal
dominion
the
colonial
empire
of
england
would
have
withered
away
and
perished
as
that
of
spain
has
done
in
the
grasp
of
the
inquisition
the
race
would
have
been
arrested
in
its
mission
to
overspread
the
earth
and
subdue
it
the
centralized
despotism
of
the
roman
empire
would
have
been
renewed
on
continental
europe
the
chains
of
romish
tyranny
and
with
them
the
general
infidelity
of
france
before
the
revolution
would
have
extinguished
or
perverted
thought
in
the
british
islands
marlborough
words
at
the
council
of
war
when
a
battle
was
resolved
on
are
remarkable
and
they
deserve
recording
we
know
them
on
the
authority
of
his
chaplain
afterward
bishop
hare
who
accompanied
him
throughout
the
campaign
and
in
whose
journal
the
biographers
of
marlborough
have
found
many
of
their
best
materials
marlborough
words
to
the
officers
who
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
seeming
temerity
of
attacking
the
enemy
in
their
position
were
i
know
the
danger
yet
a
battle
is
absolutely
necessary
and
i
rely
on
the
bravery
and
discipline
of
the
troops
which
will
make
amends
for
our
disadvantages
in
the
evening
orders
were
issued
for
a
general
engagement
and
were
received
by
the
army
with
an
alacrity
which
justified
his
confidence
the
french
and
bavarians
were
posted
behind
the
little
stream
called
the
nebel
which
runs
almost
from
north
to
south
into
the
danube
immediately
in
front
of
the
village
of
blenheim
the
nebel
flows
along
a
little
valley
and
the
french
occupied
the
rising
ground
to
the
west
of
it
the
village
of
blenheim
was
the
extreme
right
of
their
position
and
the
village
of
luetzingen
about
three
miles
north
of
blenheim
formed
their
left
beyond
luetzingen
are
the
rugged
high
grounds
of
the
godd
berg
and
eich
berg
on
the
skirts
of
which
some
detachments
were
posted
so
as
to
secure
the
position
from
being
turned
on
the
left
flank
the
danube
secured
their
right
flank
and
it
was
only
in
front
that
they
could
be
attacked
the
villages
of
blenheim
and
luetzingen
had
been
strongly
palisaded
and
intrenched
marshal
tallard
who
held
the
chief
command
took
his
station
at
blenheim
the
elector
and
marshal
marsin
commanded
on
the
left
tallard
garrisoned
blenheim
with
battalions
of
french
infantry
and
twelve
squadrons
of
french
cavalry
marsin
and
the
elector
had
battalions
of
infantry
and
squadrons
of
cavalry
in
front
of
the
village
of
luetzingen
the
centre
was
occupied
by
fourteen
battalions
of
infantry
including
the
celebrated
irish
brigade
these
were
posted
in
the
little
hamlet
of
oberglau
which
lies
somewhat
nearer
to
luetzingen
than
to
blenheim
eighty
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
seven
battalions
of
foot
were
ranged
between
oberglau
and
blenheim
thus
the
french
position
was
very
strong
at
each
extremity
but
was
comparatively
weak
in
the
centre
tallard
seems
to
have
relied
on
the
swampy
state
of
the
part
of
the
valley
that
reaches
from
below
oberglau
to
blenheim
for
preventing
any
serious
attack
on
this
part
of
his
line
the
army
of
the
allies
was
formed
into
two
great
divisions
the
largest
being
commanded
by
the
duke
in
person
and
being
destined
to
act
against
tallard
while
prince
eugene
led
the
other
division
which
consisted
chiefly
of
cavalry
and
was
intended
to
oppose
the
enemy
under
marsin
and
the
elector
as
they
approached
the
enemy
marlborough
troops
formed
the
left
and
the
centre
while
eugene
formed
the
right
of
the
entire
army
early
in
the
morning
of
august
the
allies
left
their
own
camp
and
marched
toward
the
enemy
a
thick
haze
covered
the
ground
and
it
was
not
until
the
allied
right
and
centre
had
advanced
nearly
within
of
the
enemy
that
tallard
was
aware
of
their
approach
he
made
his
preparations
with
what
haste
he
could
and
about
eight
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
was
opened
from
the
french
right
on
the
advancing
left
wing
of
the
british
marlborough
ordered
up
some
of
his
batteries
to
reply
to
it
and
while
the
columns
that
were
to
form
the
allied
left
and
centre
deployed
and
took
up
their
proper
stations
in
the
line
a
warm
cannonade
was
kept
up
by
the
guns
on
both
sides
the
ground
which
eugene
columns
jiad
to
traverse
was
peculiarly
difficult
especially
for
the
passage
of
the
artillery
and
it
was
nearly
before
he
could
get
his
troops
into
line
opposite
to
luetzingen
during
this
interval
marlborough
ordered
divine
service
to
be
performed
by
the
chaplains
at
the
head
of
each
regiment
and
then
rode
along
the
lines
and
found
both
officers
and
men
in
the
highest
spirits
and
waiting
impatiently
for
the
signal
for
the
attack
at
length
an
galloped
up
from
the
right
with
the
welcome
news
that
eugene
was
ready
marlborough
instantly
sent
lord
cutts
with
a
strong
brigade
of
infantry
to
assault
the
village
of
blenheim
while
he
himself
led
the
main
body
down
the
eastward
slope
of
the
valley
of
the
nebel
and
prepared
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
stream
the
assault
on
blenheim
though
bravely
made
was
repulsed
with
severe
loss
and
marlborough
finding
how
strongly
that
village
was
garrisoned
desisted
from
any
further
attempts
to
carry
it
and
bent
all
his
energies
to
breaking
the
enemy
line
between
blenheim
and
oberglau
some
temporary
bridges
had
been
prepared
and
planks
and
fascines
had
been
collected
and
by
the
aid
of
these
and
a
little
stone
bridge
which
crossed
the
nebel
near
a
hamlet
called
unterglau
that
lay
in
the
centre
of
the
valley
marlborough
succeeded
in
getting
several
squadrons
across
the
nebel
though
it
was
divided
into
several
branches
and
the
ground
between
them
was
soft
and
in
places
little
better
than
a
mere
marsh
but
the
french
artillery
was
not
idle
the
plunged
incessantly
among
the
advancing
squadrons
of
the
allies
and
bodies
of
french
cavalry
rode
frequently
down
from
the
western
ridge
to
charge
them
before
they
had
time
to
form
on
the
firm
ground
it
was
only
by
supporting
his
men
by
fresh
troops
and
by
bringing
up
infantry
who
checked
the
advance
of
the
horse
by
their
steady
fire
that
marlborough
was
able
to
save
his
army
in
this
quarter
from
a
repulse
which
succeeding
the
failure
of
the
attack
upon
blenheim
would
probably
have
been
fatal
to
the
allies
by
degrees
his
cavalry
struggled
over
the
bloodstained
streams
the
infantry
were
also
now
brought
across
so
as
to
keep
in
check
the
french
troops
who
held
blenheim
and
who
when
no
longer
assailed
in
front
had
begun
to
attack
the
allies
on
their
left
with
considerable
effect
marlborough
had
thus
at
length
succeeded
in
drawing
up
the
whole
left
wing
of
his
army
beyond
the
nebel
and
was
about
to
press
forward
with
it
when
he
was
called
away
to
another
part
of
the
field
by
a
disaster
that
had
befallen
his
centre
the
prince
of
holstein
beck
had
with
eleven
hanoverian
battalions
passed
the
nebel
opposite
to
oberglau
when
he
was
charged
and
utterly
routed
by
the
irish
brigade
which
held
that
village
the
irish
drove
the
hanoverians
back
with
heavy
slaughter
broke
completely
through
the
line
of
the
allies
and
nearly
achieved
a
success
as
brilliant
as
that
which
the
same
brigade
afterward
gained
at
fontenoy
but
at
blenheim
their
ardor
in
pursuit
led
them
too
far
marlborough
came
up
in
person
and
dashed
in
upon
the
exposed
flank
of
the
brigade
with
some
squadrons
of
british
cavalry
the
irish
reeled
back
and
as
they
strove
to
regain
the
height
of
oberglau
their
column
was
raked
through
and
through
by
the
fire
of
three
battalions
of
the
allies
which
marlborough
had
summoned
up
from
the
reserve
marlborough
having
reestablished
the
order
and
communications
of
the
allies
in
this
quarter
now
as
he
returned
to
his
own
left
wing
sent
to
learn
how
his
colleague
fared
against
marsin
and
the
elector
and
to
inform
eugene
of
his
own
success
eugene
had
hitherto
not
been
equally
fortunate
he
had
made
three
attacks
on
the
enemy
opposed
to
him
and
had
been
thrice
driven
back
it
was
only
by
his
own
desperate
personal
exertions
and
the
remarkable
steadiness
of
the
regiments
of
prussian
infantry
which
were
under
him
that
he
was
able
to
save
his
wing
from
being
totally
defeated
but
it
was
on
the
southern
part
of
the
on
the
ground
which
marlborough
had
won
beyond
the
nebel
with
such
difficulty
that
the
crisis
of
the
battle
was
to
be
decided
like
hannibal
marlborough
relied
principally
on
his
cavalry
for
achieving
his
decisive
successes
and
it
was
by
his
cavalry
that
blenheim
the
greatest
of
his
victories
was
won
the
battle
had
lasted
till
five
in
the
afternoon
marlborough
had
now
eight
thousand
horsemen
drawn
up
in
two
lines
and
in
the
most
perfect
order
for
a
general
attack
on
the
line
along
the
space
between
blenheim
and
oberglau
the
infantry
was
drawn
up
in
battalions
in
their
rear
so
as
to
support
them
if
repulsed
and
to
keep
in
check
the
large
masses
of
the
french
that
still
occupied
the
village
of
blenheim
tallard
now
interlaced
his
squadrons
of
cavalry
with
battalions
of
infantry
and
marlborough
by
a
corresponding
movement
brought
several
regiments
of
infantry
and
some
pieces
of
artillery
to
his
front
line
at
intervals
between
the
bodies
of
horse
a
little
after
five
marlborough
commenced
the
decisive
movement
and
the
allied
cavalry
strengthened
and
supported
by
foot
and
guns
advanced
slowly
from
the
lower
ground
near
the
nebel
up
the
slope
to
where
the
french
cavalry
ten
thousand
strong
awaited
them
on
riding
over
the
summit
of
the
acclivity
the
allies
were
received
with
so
hot
a
fire
from
the
french
artillery
and
small
arms
that
at
first
the
cavalry
recoiled
but
without
abandoning
the
high
ground
the
guns
and
the
infantry
which
they
had
brought
with
them
maintained
the
contest
with
spirit
and
effect
the
french
fire
seemed
to
slacken
marlborough
instantly
ordered
a
charge
along
the
line
the
allied
cavalry
galloped
forward
at
the
enemy
squadrons
and
the
hearts
of
the
french
horsemen
failed
them
discharging
their
carbines
at
an
idle
distance
they
wheeled
round
and
spurred
from
the
field
leaving
the
nine
infantry
battalions
of
their
comrades
to
be
ridden
down
by
the
torrent
of
the
allied
cavalry
the
battle
was
now
won
tallard
and
marsin
severed
from
each
other
thought
only
of
retreat
tallard
drew
up
the
squadrons
of
horse
that
he
had
left
in
a
line
extended
toward
blenheim
and
sent
orders
to
the
infantry
in
that
village
to
leave
it
and
join
him
without
delay
but
long
ere
his
orders
could
be
obeyed
the
conquering
squadrons
of
marlborough
had
wheeled
to
the
left
and
thundered
down
on
the
feeble
array
of
the
french
marshal
part
of
the
force
which
tallard
had
drawn
up
for
this
last
effort
was
driven
into
the
danube
part
fled
with
their
general
to
the
village
of
sonderheim
where
they
were
soon
surrounded
by
the
victorious
allies
and
compelled
to
surrender
meanwhile
eugene
had
renewed
his
attack
upon
the
left
and
marsin
finding
his
colleague
utterly
routed
and
his
own
right
flank
uncovered
prepared
to
retreat
he
and
the
elector
succeeded
in
withdrawing
a
considerable
part
of
their
troops
in
tolerable
order
to
dillingen
but
the
krge
body
of
french
who
garrisoned
blenheim
were
left
exposed
to
certain
destruction
marlborough
speedily
occupied
all
the
outlets
from
the
village
with
his
victorious
troops
and
then
collecting
his
artillery
round
it
he
commenced
a
cannonade
that
speedily
would
have
destroyed
blenheim
itself
and
all
who
were
in
it
after
several
gallant
but
unsuccessful
attempts
to
cut
their
way
through
the
allies
the
french
in
blenheim
were
at
length
compelled
to
surrender
at
discretion
and
battalions
and
twelve
squadrons
with
all
their
officers
laid
down
their
arms
and
became
the
captives
of
marlborough
such
says
voltaire
was
the
celebrated
battle
which
the
french
called
the
battle
of
hoechstaedt
the
germans
blindheim
and
the
english
blenheim
the
conquerors
had
about
five
thousand
killed
and
eight
thousand
wounded
the
greater
part
being
on
the
side
of

the

although
not
one
of

the

of
the
most
glorious
in

history
not
only
was
it
signalized
by
the
victorious
deeds
of
marlborough
in
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
but
also
by
the
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
of
england
and
scotland
one
of
the
principal
events
in
british
annals
before
the
union
england
and
scotland
had
no
political
partnership
save
that
derived
through
the
person
of
the
sovereign
by
inheritance
of
both
crowns
from
the
completion
of
the
union
in
both
countries
have
been
not
only
under
one
royal
head
but
also
represented
in
a
single
parliament
at
the
beginning
of
anne
reign
the
attitude
of
scotland
toward
england
was
hostile
old
antagonisms
surviving
in
memory
to
intensify
fresh
irritations
although
william
iii
predecessor
of
anne
had
urged
a
union
of
the
kingdoms
all
negotiations
to
that
end
had
failed
in
and
again
in
the
scottish
parliament
had
passed
an
act
of
security
declaring
in
favor
of
the
abrogation
of
the
union
of
the
crowns
which
had
existed
for
a
century
the
english
parliament
resorted
to
retaliatory
measures
by
this
time
however
the
wiser
statesmen
in
both
countries
saw
that
open
hostilities
could
be
averted
only
by
a
complete
political
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
and
they
used
all
their
influence
to
bring
it
about
how
this
great
historic
reconciliation
was
accomplished
burton
the
eminent
scottish
historian
and
jurist
shows
with
equal
learning
and
impartiality
the
english
statute
responding
by
precautions
and
threats
to
the
scots
act
of
security
contained
clauses
for
furthering
an
incorporating
union
as
the
only
conclusive
settlement
of
accumulating
difficulties
it
provided
that
commissioners
for
england
appointed
by
the
queen
under
the
great
seal
shall
have
power
to
treat
and
consult
with
commissioners
for
the
same
purpose
authorized
by
authority
of
the
parliament
of
scotland
the
statute
of
the
parliament
of
scotland
completing
the
adjustment
with
the
short
title
act
for
a
treaty
with
england
authorizes
such
persons
as
shall
be
nominated
and
appointed
by
her
majesty
under
the
great
seal
of
this
kingdom
to
treat
and
consult
with
the
commissioners
for
england
the
next
great
step
was
the
appointment
of
the
two
commissions
on
either
side
on
the
english
were
the
two
archbishops
for
scotland
there
was
no
clerical
element
it
was
noticed
that
for
england
all
the
members
not
official
were
from
the
peerage
while
in
scotland
there
seemed
to
be
a
desire
to
represent
the
peerage
the
landed
commoners
and
the
burgesses
or
city
interest
in
just
proportions
at
an
early
stage
in
the
daily
business
the
english
brought
up
a
proposition
about
the
reception
of
which
they
had
considerable
apprehension
that
there
should
be
the
same
customs
excise
and
all
other
taxes
throughout
the
united
kingdom
virtually
a
resolution
that
scotland
should
be
taxed
on
the
english
scale
this
was
easily
passed
by
means
of
a
solvent
due
no
doubt
to
the
financial
genius
of
godolphin
that
on
an
accounting
and
proof
of
local
or
personal
hardships
arising
from
the
adoption
of
uniformity
compensation
in
money
should
be
made
from
the
english
treasury
but
a
more
critical
point
was
reached
when
on
april
the
chancellor
of
scotland
brought
forward
among
certain
preliminary
articles
one
that
there
be
free
communication
and
intercourse
of
trade
and
navigation
between
the
two
kingdoms
and
plantations
thereunto
belonging
under
such
regulations
as
in
the
progress
of
this
treaty
shall
be
found
most
for
the
advantage
of
both
kingdoms
this
was
frankly
accepted
on
the
part
of
england
and
faithfully
adjusted
in
detail
it
was
felt
to
be
a
mighty
sacrifice
made
to
exercise
indefinite
but
formidable
calamities
in
another
shape
at
this
point
in
the
progress
of
the
union
all
interest
resting
on
the
excitements
of
political
victory
and
defeat
or
the
chances
of
a
bitter
war
came
to
an
end
there
were
a
few
small
incidents
in
scotland
but
england
was
placidly
indifferent
she
had
cheerfully
paid
a
heavy
stake
as
loser
in
the
great
game
and
it
would
trouble
her
no
more
the
statesmen
of
the
two
countries
knew
that
the
union
must
pass
unless
the
jacobites
of
scotland
were
joined
by
an
invading
french
army
and
that
was
not
a
likely
casualty
while
marlborough
was
hovering
on
the
frontiers
of
france
there
was
a
touch
of
the
native
haughtiness
in
this
placid
indifference
of
england
no
doubt
it
helped
in
clearing
the
way
to
the
great
conclusion
but
for
many
years
after
the
fusing
of
the
two
nations
into
one
disturbing
events
showed
that
it
had
been
better
had
the
english
known
something
about
the
national
institutions
and
the
temper
of
the
people
who
had
now
a
right
to
call
themselves
their
it
was
expected
that
scotland
would
be
quietly
absorbed
into
england
absorptions
much
more
difficult
in
the
first
aspect
were
in
continuous
progress
in
asia
and
america
the
englishman
had
great
difficulty
in
reconciling
himself
to
political
and
social
conditions
not
his
own
and
his
pride
prompted
him
to
demand
that
if
he
left
england
any
part
of
the
world
honored
by
his
presence
should
make
an
england
for
his
reception
when
expecting
this
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
he
forgot
that
the
scot
had
too
much
of
his
own
independence
and
obstinacy
true
the
scot
among
the
sweet
uses
of
adversity
had
imbibed
more
of
the
vagrant
and
could
adapt
himself
more
easily
to
the
usages
and
temper
of
other
nations
but
on
the
question
of
yielding
up
his
own
national
usages
and
prejudices
in
his
own
country
he
was
as
obstinate
as
his
mighty
partner
there
was
stills
world
of
business
to
be
transacted
in
details
of
the
unattractive
kind
that
belong
to
accountants
reports
these
may
be
objects
of
vital
and
intense
interest
as
in
the
realizing
of
the
assets
in
bankruptcies
where
persons
immediately
interested
in
frantic
excitement
hunt
out
the
array
of
small
figures
two
three
four
or
five
that
tells
them
whether
they
are
safe
or
ruined
but
the
interest
is
not
of
a
kind
to
hold
its
intensity
through
after
generations
on
some
items
of
the
present
accounting
however
there
was
in
the
principle
adopted
a
fund
of
personal
and
political
interest
the
heavy
debts
of
england
had
to
be
considered
and
here
as
in
all
pecuniary
arrangements
england
was
freehanded
the
scots
made
an
effort
to
retain
their
african
company
but
they
fortunately
offered
the
alternative
of
purchasing
the
stock
from
the
holders
on
the
alternative
of
retention
the
english
commissioners
were
resolute
in
refusal
and
resistance
but
they
were
ready
to
entertain
the
other
and
they
accepted
it
in
a
literal
shape
to
have
bought
the
stock
at
its
market
value
would
have
been
a
farce
after
the
ruin
that
had
overcome
the
company
but
if
it
could
not
be
even
said
that
england
had
ruined
the
company
the
sacrifice
had
been
made
in
the
prevalence
of
english
interests
and
while
there
was
yet
a
hold
on
england
it
should
be
kept
there
was
no
difficulty
in
coming
to
a
settlement
satisfactory
to
the
scots
and
willingly
offered
by
the
english
it
was
substantially
payment
of
the
loss
on
each
share
as
calculated
from
an
examination
of
the
company
books
the
adjustment
of
the
several
pecuniary
claims
thus
created
in
favor
of
scotland
was
simply
the
collective
summation
of
the
losses
incurred
by
all
the
stockholders
and
when
the
summation
was
completed
the
total
was
passed
into
a
capital
sum
called
the
equivalent
this
sum
total
of
the
various
items
with
all
their
fractions
making
up
a
fractional
sum
less
than
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
might
be
otherwise
described
as
a
capital
stock
held
by
the
shareholders
of
the
old
company
trading
to
africa
and
the
indies
each
to
the
extent
of
his
loss
odious
suspicions
were
down
to
the
present
generation
propagated
about
an
item
or
group
of
items
in
the
equivalent
a
sum
amounting
to
twenty
thousand
five
hundred
forty
pounds
seventeen
shillings
sevenpence
had
been
made
over
by
the
english
treasury
to
be
paid
to
influential
scotsmen
as
the
price
of
their
votes
or
influence
in
favor
of
england
fortunately
this
affair
was
closely
investigated
by
the
celebrated
committee
of
inquiry
that
brought
on
marlborough
dismissal
and
imprisonment
it
was
found
that
the
scots
treasury
had
been
drained
and
the
crisis
of
the
union
was
not
a
suitable
time
either
for
levying
money
or
for
leaving
debts
the
salaries
of
public
offices
especially
unpaid
england
therefore
lent
money
to
clear
away
this
difficulty
the
transaction
was
irregular
and
had
not
passed
through
the
proper
treasury
forms
it
was
ascertained
however
that
the
money
so
lent
had
been
repaid
in
discussions
of
the
affair
before
those
concerned
were
fully
cleared
of
the
odium
of
bribery
taunting
remarks
had
been
made
on
the
oddity
and
sordid
specialties
of
the
items
of
payment
thus
the
allowance
to
the
lord
banff
was
in
sterling
money
eleven
pounds
two
shillings
it
would
have
had
a
richer
sound
and
perhaps
resolved
itself
into
round
numbers
in
scots
money
but
as
it
is
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
against
it
than
that
as
a
debt
in
some
way
due
to
the
lord
banff
the
exact
english
had
entered
it
down
to
its
fraction
there
remained
a
few
matters
of
adjustment
of
uniformities
between
the
two
countries
for
the
advantage
of
both
such
as
a
fixed
standard
for
rating
money
in
account
the
scots
grumbled
rather
than
complained
about
the
english
standard
being
always
made
the
rule
and
no
reciprocity
being
offered
but
the
scots
were
left
considerable
facilities
for
the
use
of
their
own
customs
for
home
purposes
in
pecuniary
matters
and
in
weights
and
measures
if
for
the
general
convenience
of
commerce
and
taxation
any
uniformity
was
necessary
and
the
practice
of
the
greater
nation
was
a
suitable
standard
for
the
other
it
was
the
smaller
sacrifice
and
to
both
parties
the
easier
arrangement
that
those
who
were
only
an
eighth
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
should
yield
to
the
overwhelming
majority
it
was
in
keeping
with
the
wisdom
and
tolerance
prevailing
throughout
on
the
english
side
of
the
treaty
that
it
should
be
first
discussed
in
the
parliament
of
scotland
if
this
was
felt
as
a
courtesy
to
scotland
it
was
an
expediency
for
england
all
opposition
would
be
in
scotland
and
it
was
well
to
know
it
at
once
that
disputes
might
be
cleared
off
and
a
simple
affirmative
or
negative
presented
to
the
parliament
of
scotland
the
parliament
of
england
has
ever
restrained
vague
oratory
by
a
rule
that
there
must
always
be
a
question
of
yes
or
no
fitted
for
a
division
as
the
text
of
a
debate
in
scotland
on
this
occasion
as
on
many
others
there
was
at
first
a
discussion
of
the
general
question
and
when
this
along
with
other
sources
of
information
had
given
the
servants
of
the
crown
some
assurance
of
the
fate
of
the
measure
there
was
a
separate
debate
and
division
on
the
first
article
understood
on
all
hands
to
be
a
final
decision
the
debate
was
decorated
by
a
work
of
oratorical
art
long
admired
in
scotland
and
indeed
worthy
of
admiration
anywhere
for
its
brilliancy
and
power
it
was
a
great
philippic
taking
that
term
in
its
usual
acceptation
as
expressing
a
vehement
torrent
of
bitter
epigram
and
denunciatory
climax
the
speech
of
john
hamilton
lord
belhaven
on
the
of
a
union
betwixt
the
two
kingdoms
of
england
and
scotland
was
so
amply
dispersed
in
its
day
that
if
a
collector
of
pamphlets
on
the
union
buys
them
in
volumes
he
will
generally
find
this
speech
in
each
volume
it
is
no
doubt
an
effort
of
genius
but
what
will
confer
more
interest
on
the
following
specimens
selected
from
it
is
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
rouse
the
nation
to
action
at
this
perilous
and
momentous
crisis
and
succeeded
only
in
drawing
attention
and
admiration
as
a
fine
specimen
of
rhetorical
art
i
think
i
see
the
present
peers
of
scotland
whose
noble
ancestors
conquered
provinces
overran
countries
reduced
and
subjected
towns
and
fortified
places
exacted
tribute
through
the
greater
part
of
england
now
walking
in
the
court
of
requests
like
so
many
english
attorneys
laying
aside
their
when
in
company
with
the
english
peers
lest
their
should
be
found
murder
i
think
i
see
the
royal
state
of
boroughs
walking
their
desolate
streets
hanging
down
their
heads
under
disappointments
wormed
out
of
all
the
branches
of
their
old
trade
uncertain
what
hand
to
turn
to
necessitate
to
become
to
their
unkind
neighbors
and
yet
after
all
finding
their
trade
so
fortified
by
companies
and
secured
by
prescriptions
that
they
despair
of
any
success
therein
but
above
all
my
lord
i
think
i
see
our
ancient
mother
caledonia
like
caesar
sitting
in
the
midst
of
our
senate
ruefully
looking
round
her
covering
herself
with
her
royal
garment
attending
the
fatal
blow
and
breathing
out
her
last
with
a
tu
quoque
mi
fili
the
great
remedy
for
all
is
an
end
of
rancorous
feuds
and
hatreds
dividing
scotland
and
this
calls
from
him
a
glowing
picture
of
the
land
that
by
union
and
industry
has
made
itself
too
powerful
to
be
a
safe
partner
for
humiliated
scotland
they
are
not
under
the
afflicting
hand
of
providence
as
we
are
their
circumstances
are
great
and
glorious
their
treaties
are
prudently
managed
both
at
home
and
abroad
their
generals
brave
and
valorous
their
armies
successful
and
victorious
their
trophies
and
laurels
memorable
and
surprising
their
enemies
subdued
and
routed
their
royal
navy
is
the
terror
of
europe
their
trade
and
commerce
extended
through
the
universe
encircling
the
whole
world
and
rendering
their
own
capital
city
the
emporium
for
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
earth
the
speech
was
for
the
country
not
for
the
house
the
great
points
about
trade
and
virtual
independence
had
been
conceded
by
england
and
a
union
was
looked
to
rather
as
a
refuge
and
a
gain
than
as
oppression
and
plunder
it
has
even
been
said
that
there
was
some
inclination
to
receive
the
speech
with
irony
and
defoe
who
seems
to
have
been
present
on
the
occasion
gives
this
account
of
what
followed
seton
who
made
the
first
speech
stood
up
to
answer
the
lord
belhaven
but
as
he
had
already
spoken
the
order
of
the
house
the
same
member
could
not
speak
twice
in
the
same
cause
was
urged
against
his
speaking
and
the
earl
of
marchmont
standing
up
at
the
same
time
the
lord
chancellor
gave
place
to
him
who
indeed
made
a
short
return
to
so
long
a
speech
and
which
answer
occasioned
some
laughter
in
the
house
the
earl
of
marchmont
speech
was
to
this
purpose
viz
he
had
heard
a
long
speech
and
a
very
terrible
one
but
he
was
of
opinion
it
required
a
short
answer
which
he
gave
in
these
terms
he
dreamed
but
lo
when
he
awoke
he
found
it
was
a
dream
this
answer
some
said
was
as
satisfactory
to
the
members
who
understood
the
design
of
that
speech
as
if
it
had
been
answered
vision
by
vision
in
the
debates
on
the
union
some
scots
statesmen
found
a
tactic
infinitely
valuable
to
them
in
the
united
parliament
of
voting
in
a
group
they
were
called
the
new
party
and
nicknamed
the
in
the
correspondence
already
referred
to
it
was
good
news
at
stephen
when
it
was
announced
that
the
new
party
had
adopted
the
union
on
the
critical
division
the
numbers
stood
one
hundred
eighteen
for
the
article
and
against
it
the
remainder
of
the
clauses
passed
without
division
a
ready
acceptance
being
given
to
amendments
that
were
virtually
improvements
in
giving
effect
to
the
spirit
of
details
in
the
treaty
as
where
it
was
adjusted
that
for
trading
purposes
vessels
bought
abroad
for
trade
from
the
scots
harbors
should
be
counted
equivalent
to
vessels
of
scottish
build
there
was
a
considerable
noisy
excitement
through
the
country
the
jacobites
ever
striving
to
rouse
the
people
in
the
great
towns
to
riot
and
sedition
and
when
they
found
that
impossible
spreading
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
effects
of
their
efforts
a
mob
was
raised
in
edinburgh
but
it
was
appeased
without
the
loss
of
life
and
with
no
other
casualty
save
the
frightening
of
the
provost
wife
there
were
some
eccentric
movements
among
the
cameronians
rendered
all
the
more
grotesque
by
the
jacobites
taking
the
leadership
in
them
and
some
of
the
more
vehement
clergy
betook
themselves
to
their
own
special
weapons
in
the
holding
of
a
day
of
humiliation
and
prayer
ere
the
whole
came
to
a
conclusion
a
point
was
yielded
to
the
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
it
was
passed
as
a
separate
act
before
the
act
of
union
was
passed
the
separate
act
stipulating
its
repetition
in
any
act
adopting
the
treaty
of
union
it
provided
for
the
preservation
of
the
discipline
worship
and
ecclesiastical
government
of
the
establishment
it
was
further
provided
that
every
sovereign
of
the
united
kingdom
on
accession
to
the
throne
should
make
oath
in
terms
of
this
act
hence
it
happens
that
this
oath
is
taken
immediately
on
the
accession
the
other
oaths
including
that
for
the
protection
of
the
church
of
england
being
postponed
till
the
ceremony
of
the
coronation
on
october
there
came
a
vote
on
the
passing
of
the
act
ratifying
and
approving
the
treaty
of
union
this
was
carried
in
the
scots
parliament
by
one
hundred
ten
to
it
was
the
determination
of
the
queen
ministers
for
england
to
carry
the
treaty
as
it
came
from
scotland
word
for
word
and
they
employed
all
their
strength
to
do
so
it
was
the
policy
of
the
english
government
and
their
supporters
in
the
matter
of
the
union
to
avoid
a
parliamentary
debate
upon
it
clause
by
clause
at
stephen
to
this
end
there
was
an
endeavor
to
give
it
as
much
as
in
the
peculiar
conditions
could
be
given
the
character
of
a
treaty
between
two
independent
powers
each
acting
through
its
executive
that
executive
acknowledging
the
full
power
of
parliament
to
examine
criticise
and
virtually
judge
the
act
done
as
a
whole
but
not
admitting
parliamentary
interference
with
the
progress
of
the
details
if
there
were
an
illogicality
in
the
essence
of
a
treaty
where
the
executive
the
queen
was
the
common
sovereign
of
both
realms
the
difficulty
could
be
discarded
as
a
pedantry
in
a
constitutional
community
where
the
sovereign
acts
through
responsible
advisers
some
slight
touches
of
apprehension
were
felt
in
england
when
it
was
seen
that
the
scots
estates
were
not
only
voting
the
separate
articles
but
in
some
measure
remodelling
them
the
estates
were
taking
the
privilege
naturally
claimed
by
the
weaker
party
to
a
bargain
in
protecting
themselves
while
it
was
yet
time
when
all
was
adjusted
england
as
the
vast
majority
could
correct
whatever
had
been
done
amiss
in
the
preliminary
adjustment
of
her
interests
but
poor
scotland
would
be
entirely
helpless
there
was
another
reason
for
tolerating
the
alterations
in
their
being
directed
to
the
safety
and
completeness
of
the
legal
institutions
left
in
the
hands
of
scotland
untouched
as
matters
of
entire
indifference
to
england
still
it
weakened
the
hands
of
those
who
desired
to
evade
a
parliamentary
discussion
on
the
several
articles
in
england
that
this
had
been
permitted
in
scotland
and
had
become
effective
in
the
shape
of
amendments
john
johnston
who
had
been
for
some
time
secretary
of
state
for
scotland
a
son
of
the
celebrated
covenanting
hero
archibald
johnston
of
warriston
was
then
in
london
carefully
looking
at
the
signs
of
the
times
he
wrote
to
scotland
saying
you
may
i
think
depend
on
it
that
the
alterations
you
have
hitherto
made
will
not
break
the
union
but
if
you
go
on
altering
it
like
your
alterations
will
be
altered
here
which
will
make
a
new
session
with
you
necessary
and
in
that
case
no
man
knows
what
may
happen
all
is
well
as
yet
january
and
if
there
be
no
more
serious
alterations
the
english
ministers
will
be
able
to
give
effect
to
their
resolution
to
pass
the
union
here
without
making
any
alterations
at
all
by
what
had
been
usually
called
a
message
from
the
throne
the
attention
of
parliament
was
directed
to
the
treaty
as
it
had
come
from
scotland
but
the
matter
being
of
supreme
importance
the
queen
was
her
own
messenger
from
the
commons
she
had
to
ask
for
a
supply
to
meet
the
equivalent
to
both
houses
she
said
you
have
now
an
opportunity
before
you
of
putting
the
last
hand
to
a
happy
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
which
i
hope
will
be
a
lasting
blessing
to
the
whole
island
a
great
addition
to
its
wealth
and
power
and
a
firm
security
to
the
protestant
religion
the
advantages
that
will
accrue
to
us
all
from
a
union
are
so
apparent
that
i
will
add
no
more
but
that
i
shall
look
upon
it
as
a
particular
happiness
if
this
great
work
which
has
been
so
often
attempted
without
success
can
be
brought
to
perfection
in
my
reign
the
opportunity
was
taken
to
imitate
the
scots
in
a
separate
preliminary
act
for
securing
the
church
of
england
as
by
law
established
there
was
a
desultory
discussion
in
both
houses
with
a
result
showing
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
supporters
of
the
union
in
the
house
of
lords
there
were
some
divisions
and
among
these
the
largest
number
of
votes
mustered
by
the
opposition
was
bringing
out
a
majority
of
by
seventy
votes
for
the
ministry
the
conclusion
of
the
discussion
was
a
vote
of
approval
by
each
house
the
opposition
however
did
not
adopt
their
defeat
they
were
preparing
to
fight
the
battle
over
again
clause
by
clause
when
a
bill
was
brought
in
to
convert
the
articles
of
union
into
an
act
of
parliament
the
english
house
of
commons
has
always
been
supremely
tolerant
to
troublesome
and
even
mischievous
members
so
long
as
they
adhere
to
the
forms
of
the
house
forms
to
be
zealously
guarded
since
they
were
framed
for
averting
hasty
legislation
and
the
possible
domination
of
an
intolerant
majority
it
was
determined
however
that
the
impracticals
and
impedimenters
should
not
have
their
swing
on
this
occasion
when
the
descent
of
a
french
army
to
gather
to
its
centre
the
jacobitism
still
lingering
in
the
country
darkened
the
political
horizon
both
houses
had
a
full
opportunity
for
discussing
the
merits
of
every
word
in
the
treaty
and
the
risk
of
national
ruin
was
not
to
be
encountered
because
they
had
not
expended
all
their
loquacity
having
expected
another
opportunity
the
tactic
for
evading
the
danger
was
credited
to
the
ingenuity
of
sir
simon
harcourt
the
the
two
acts
of
ecclesiastical
security
and
the
articles
of
the
treaty
were
all
recited
in
the
preamble
of
the
bill
under
the
command
of
the
mighty
whereas
the
enacting
part
of
the
act
was
dropped
into
a
single
sentence
shorter
than
statutory
sentences
usually
are
the
opposition
might
throw
out
the
measure
and
the
ministry
with
it
if
they
had
strength
to
do
so
but
there
had
been
sufficient
discussion
on
the
clauses
and
there
should
be
no
more
in
the
descriptive
words
of
burnet
this
put
those
in
great
difficulties
who
had
resolved
to
object
to
several
articles
and
to
insist
on
demanding
several
alterations
in
them
for
they
could
not
come
at
any
debate
about
them
they
could
not
object
to
the
recital
it
being
mere
matter
of
fact
and
they
had
not
strength
enough
to
oppose
the
general
enacting
clause
nor
was
it
easy
to
come
at
particulars
and
offer
provisos
relating
to
them
the
matter
was
carried
on
with
such
zeal
that
it
passed
through
the
house
of
commons
before
those
who
intended
to
oppose
it
had
recovered
out
of
the
surprise
under
which
the
form
it
was
drawn
in
had
put
them
there
was
thus
but
one
question
that
the
bill
do
pass
and
the
opposition
had
not
reaped
encouragement
to
resist
so
great
an
issue
the
lords
had
in
their
usual
manner
of
dignified
repose
managed
to
discuss
the
clauses
but
it
was
rather
a
conversation
to
see
that
all
was
in
right
order
and
that
no
accident
had
happened
to
a
measure
of
so
vital
moment
than
a
debate
on
march
the
queen
came
to
the
house
of
lords
and
in
a
graceful
speech
gave
the
royal
assent
to
the
act
downfall
of
charles
xii
at
poltava
triumph
of
russia
waliszewski
footnote
translated
from
the
russian
by
lady
mary
loyd
the
battle
of
poltava
was
selected
by
sir
edward
creasy
as
one
of
the
fifteen
great
decisive
contests
which
have
altered
the
fate
of
nations
his
able
narrative
of
the
battle
has
been
superseded
in
scholars
eyes
by
the
more
modern
work
of
the
great
russian
authority
waliszewski
but
the
importance
of
the
event
remains
it
reversed
the
positions
of
sweden
and
russia
in
european
politics
and
placed
russia
among
the
great
countries
of
the
modern
world
sweden
among
the
little
ones
before
sweden
still
held
the
rank
to
which
gustavus
adolphus
had
raised
her
in
the
thirty
years
war
her
prestige
had
been
a
little
dimmed
by
the
victories
of
the
great
elector
of
prussia
but
her
ally
louis
xiv
had
saved
her
from
any
considerable
diminution
of
the
extensive
territories
which
she
held
on
the
mainland
to
the
south
and
east
of
the
baltic
sea
about
the
young
and
gallant
warrior
charles
xii
the
madman
of
the
north
reasserted
her
prowess
made
her
once
more
the
dictator
of
northern
europe
one
of
the
five
great
powers
of
the
world
meanwhile
peter
the
great
was
progressing
but
slowly
with
his
transformation
of
russia
his
people
had
little
confidence
in
him
his
armies
were
hordes
when
he
ventured
into
war
against
sweden
europe
conceived
but
one
possible
result
these
undisciplined
barbarians
would
be
annihilated
at
first
the
expected
occurred
again
and
again
large
russian
armies
were
defeated
by
small
bodies
of
swedes
but
with
splendid
tenacity
peter
persisted
in
the
face
of
revolt
at
home
and
defeat
abroad
the
swedes
shall
teach
us
to
beat
them
was
his
famous
saying
and
at
poltava
he
achieved
his
aim
from
that
time
forward
russia
antagonism
to
her
leader
disappeared
his
people
followed
him
eagerly
along
the
path
to
power
it
would
appear
that
it
was
not
till
peter
visit
to
vienna
in
that
he
conceived
the
idea
of
attacking
sweden
up
till
that
time
his
warlike
impulse
had
rather
been
directed
southward
and
the
turk
had
been
the
sole
object
of
his
enmity
but
at
vienna
he
perceived
that
the
emperor
whose
help
he
had
counted
on
had
failed
him
and
forthwith
the
mobile
mind
of
the
young
czar
turned
to
the
a
war
he
must
have
of
some
kind
it
little
mattered
where
to
give
work
to
his
young
army
the
warlike
instincts
and
the
greed
of
his
predecessors
tempted
sometimes
by
the
black
sea
sometimes
by
the
baltic
and
the
border
provinces
of
poland
had
indeed
always
swung
and
turned
back
and
forward
between
the
south
and
the
north
these
alternate
impulses
natural
enough
in
a
nation
so
full
of
youth
and
strength
have
since
those
days
been
most
unnecessarily
idealized
erected
into
a
doctrine
and
dignified
as
a
work
of
unification
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
every
nation
has
at
one
time
or
the
other
thus
claimed
the
right
to
resume
the
national
patrimony
at
the
expense
of
neighboring
peoples
and
peter
by
some
lucky
fate
remained
in
this
respect
within
certain
bounds
of
justice
of
logic
and
of
truth
absorbed
and
almost
exhausted
as
he
soon
became
by
the
desperate
effort
demanded
by
his
war
in
the
north
he
forgot
or
imperilled
much
that
the
conquering
ambition
of
his
predecessors
had
left
him
in
the
south
and
west
he
clung
to
the
territory
already
acquired
on
the
polish
side
retired
from
the
turkish
border
and
claimed
what
he
had
most
right
relatively
speaking
to
claim
in
the
matter
of
resumption
on
his
northwestern
frontier
on
that
frontier
the
coast
country
between
the
mouth
of
the
narva
or
narova
and
that
of
the
siestra
watered
by
the
voksa
the
neva
the
igora
and
the
louga
was
really
an
integral
part
of
the
original
russian
patrimony
it
was
one
of
the
five
districts
of
the
novgorod
territory
and
was
still
full
of
towns
bearing
slavonic
names
such
as
korela
ojeshek
ladoga
koporie
iamy
and
ivangrod
it
was
not
till
that
the
czar
michael
feodorovitch
during
his
struggle
with
gustavus
adolphus
finally
abandoned
the
seacoast
for
the
sake
of
keeping
his
hold
on
novgorod
but
so
strong
was
the
hope
of
recovering
the
lost
territory
in
the
hearts
of
his
descendants
that
after
the
failure
of
an
attempt
on
livonia
in
alexis
reign
a
boyar
named
set
to
work
to
build
a
number
of
warships
at
kokenhausen
on
the
dvina
which
vessels
were
intended
for
the
conquest
of
riga
peter
had
an
impression
confused
it
may
be
but
yet
powerful
of
these
historic
traditions
this
is
proved
by
the
direction
in
which
he
caused
his
armies
to
march
after
he
had
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
to
sweden
he
strayed
off
the
path
swayed
as
he
often
was
by
sudden
impulses
but
he
always
came
back
to
the
traditional
aim
of
his
forefathers
access
to
the
sea
a
baltic
port
a
window
open
upon
europe
his
interview
with
augustus
ii
at
rawa
definitely
settled
his
wavering
mind
the
signed
by
the
king
of
poland
when
he
ascended
his
throne
bound
him
to
claim
from
the
king
of
sweden
the
territories
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
the
republic
of
poland
for
this
end
the
help
of
denmark
could
be
reckoned
on
the
treaty
of
roeskilde
which
had
been
forced
on
frederick
iii
weighed
heavily
on
his
successors
and
the
eager
glances
fixed
by
the
neighboring
states
on
holstein
after
the
death
of
christian
albert
in
threatened
to
end
in
quarrel
there
were
fair
hopes
too
of
the
help
of
brandenburg
when
sweden
made
alliance
with
louis
xiv
and
madame
de
maintenon
that
country
abandoned
its
historic
position
in
germany
to
prussia
but
sweden
still
kept
some
footing
and
was
looked
on
as
a
rival
further
augustus
had
a
personal
charm
for
peter
sufficient
in
itself
to
prove
how
much
simplicity
inexperience
and
boyish
thoughtlessness
still
existed
in
that
mind
the
polish
sovereign
tall
strong
and
handsome
an
adept
in
all
physical
exercises
a
great
hunter
a
hard
drinker
and
an
indefatigable
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
in
whose
person
debauch
of
every
kind
took
royal
proportions
delighted
the
czar
and
somewhat
overawed
him
he
was
more
than
inclined
to
think
him
a
genius
and
was
quite
ready
to
bind
up
his
fortunes
with
his
friend
at
the
end
of
four
days
of
uninterrupted
feasting
they
had
agreed
on
the
division
of
the
spoils
of
sweden
and
had
made
a
preliminary
exchange
of
arms
and
clothing
the
czar
appeared
at
moscow
a
few
weeks
later
wearing
the
king
of
waistcoat
and
belted
with
his
sword
in
the
beginning
of
augustus
and
frederick
of
denmark
attacked
sweden
but
peter
though
bound
by
treaty
to
follow
their
example
neither
moved
nor
stirred
frederick
was
beaten
his
very
capital
was
threatened
so
much
the
worse
for
him
augustus
seized
on
dunamunde
but
utterly
failed
before
riga
all
the
better
for
the
russians
riga
was
left
for
them
another
envoy
came
hurrying
to
moscow
the
czar
listened
coolly
to
his
reproaches
and
replied
that
he
would
act
as
soon
as
news
from
constantinople
permitted
it
negotiations
there
were
proceeding
satisfactorily
and
he
hoped
shortly
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
to
attack
the
swedes
in
the
neighborhood
of
pskof
this
was
a
point
on
which
the
allies
had
laid
great
stress
and
peter
had
studiously
avoided
contradicting
them
it
was
quite
understood
between
them
that
the
czar
was
not
to
lay
a
finger
on
livonia
at
last
on
august
a
courier
arrived
with
the
dispatch
peace
with
turkey
was
signed
at
last
and
that
very
day
the
russian
troops
received
their
marching
orders
but
they
were
not
sent
toward
pskof
they
marched
on
narva
in
the
very
heart
of
the
livonian
country
the
army
destined
to
lay
siege
to
narva
consisted
of
three
divisions
of
novel
formation
under
the
orders
of
three
generals
golovin
weyde
and
repnin
with
cossacks
and
some
irregular
troops
men
in
all
repnin
division
numbering
men
and
the
little
russian
cossacks
stopped
on
the
way
so
that
the
actual
force
at
disposal
was
reduced
to
about
men
but
charles
xii
the
new
king
of
sweden
could
not
bring
more
than
infantry
and
cavalry
to
the
relief
of
the
town
and
being
obliged
when
he
neared
wesemburg
to
throw
himself
in
flying
column
across
a
country
which
was
already
completely
devastated
and
consequently
to
carry
all
his
supplies
with
him
his
troops
arrived
in
presence
of
an
enemy
five
times
as
numerous
as
themselves
worn
out
and
completely
exhausted
by
a
succession
of
forced
marches
peter
never
dreamed
that
he
would
find
the
king
of
sweden
in
livonia
he
believed
his
hands
were
more
than
full
enough
elsewhere
with
the
king
of
denmark
he
was
quite
unaware
that
the
peace
of
travendal
which
had
been
signed
on
the
very
day
of
the
departure
of
the
russian
troops
had
been
already
forced
upon
his
ally
he
started
off
gayly
at
the
head
of
his
bombardier
company
full
of
expectation
of
an
easy
victory
when
he
arrived
before
the
town
on
september
he
was
astounded
to
find
any
preparations
for
serious
defence
a
regular
siege
had
to
be
undertaken
and
when
after
a
month
of
preparations
the
russian
batteries
at
last
opened
fire
they
made
no
impression
whatever
the
artillery
was
bad
and
yet
more
badly
served
a
second
month
passed
during
which
peter
waited
and
hoped
for
some
piece
of
luck
either
for
an
offer
to
capitulate
or
for
the
arrival
of
repnin
force
what
did
happen
was
that
on
the
night
of
november
news
came
that
within
hours
the
king
of
sweden
would
be
at
narva
that
very
night
peter
fled
from
his
camp
leaving
the
command
to
the
prince
de
croy
none
of
the
arguments
brought
forward
by
the
sovereign
and
his
apologists
in
justification
of
this
step
appears
to
me
to
hold
water
the
necessity
pleaded
for
an
interview
with
the
duke
of
poland
the
czar
desire
to
hasten
on
repnin
march
are
mere
pitiful
excuses
langen
and
hallart
the
generals
sent
by
augustus
to
observe
the
military
operations
in
livonia
gravely
reported
that
the
czar
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
moscow
to
receive
a
turkish
envoy
who
was
not
expected
for
four
months
the
emperor
envoy
pleyer
is
nearer
the
mark
when
he
says
the
sovereign
obeyed
the
entreaties
of
his
advisers
who
considered
the
danger
too
great
for
him
to
be
permitted
to
remain
and
hallart
himself
speaking
of
these
same
counsellors
whether
ministers
or
generals
does
not
hesitate
to
declare
in
his
rough
soldierly
language
that
they
have
about
as
much
courage
as
a
frog
has
hair
on
his
belly
the
russian
army
disconcerted
by
the
unexpected
resistance
of
the
swedes
for
resistance
and
was
already
demoralized
to
the
last
extent
the
arrival
of
charles
caused
a
panic
and
from
that
panic
peter
the
most
impressionable
of
men
was
the
first
to
suffer
the
startling
rapidity
with
which
charles
had
rid
himself
of
the
weakest
of
his
three
adversaries
under
the
very
walls
of
copenhagen
would
have
been
less
astonishing
to
peter
if
the
young
sovereign
had
better
realized
the
conditions
under
which
he
and
his
allies
had
begun
a
struggle
in
which
at
first
sight
their
superiority
appeared
so
disproportionate
king
frederick
had
reckoned
without
the
powers
which
had
guaranteed
the
recent
treaty
of
altona
by
which
the
safety
of
holstein
was
insured
without
the
hanoverian
troops
and
those
of
luneburg
which
at
once
brought
succor
to
toeningen
without
the
fleet
which
forced
his
to
seek
shelter
under
the
walls
of
copenhagen
and
thus
permitted
the
king
of
sweden
to
cross
the
sound
unmolested
and
land
quietly
in
zealand
and
finally
he
reckoned
and
for
this
he
may
well
be
excused
without
that
which
was
soon
to
fill
all
europe
with
terror
and
amazement
the
lucky
star
and
the
military
genius
of
charles
xii
this
monarch
born
in
who
had
slain
bears
when
he
was
sixteen
and
at
eighteen
was
a
finished
soldier
greedy
for
glory
and
battle
and
blood
was
the
last
representative
of
that
race
of
men
who
between
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
held
all
central
europe
in
their
iron
grip
fierce
warriors
who
steeped
germany
and
italy
in
fire
and
blood
fought
their
way
from
town
to
town
and
hamlet
to
hamlet
giving
no
truce
and
showing
no
mercy
who
lived
for
war
and
by
war
grew
old
and
died
in
harness
in
a
very
atmosphere
of
carnage
with
bodies
riddled
with
wounds
with
hands
stained
with
abominable
crimes
but
with
spirits
calm
and
unflinching
to
the
last
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
new
period
he
was
the
superb
and
colossal
incarnation
of
that
former
one
which
happily
for
mankind
was
to
disappear
in
his
person
count
guiscard
who
as
envoy
from
the
king
of
france
accompanied
him
on
his
first
campaign
describes
him
thus
the
king
of
sweden
is
of
tall
stature
taller
than
myself
by
almost
a
head
he
is
very
handsome
he
has
fine
eyes
and
a
good
complexion
his
face
is
long
his
speech
a
little
thick
he
wears
a
small
wig
tied
behind
in
a
bag
a
plain
stock
without
cravat
a
very
tight
jerkin
of
plain
cloth
with
sleeves
as
narrow
as
our
waistcoat
sleeves
a
narrow
belt
above
his
jerkin
with
a
sword
of
extraordinary
length
and
thickness
and
almost
perfectly
shoes
a
very
strange
style
of
dress
for
a
prince
of
his
age
in
order
to
reach
narva
with
his
eight
thousand
men
charles
after
having
crossed
a
tract
of
desert
country
was
obliged
at
a
place
called
pyhaioggi
to
cross
a
narrow
valley
divided
by
a
stream
which
if
it
had
been
fortified
must
have
stopped
him
short
the
idea
occurred
to
gordon
but
peter
would
not
listen
to
him
and
it
was
not
till
the
very
last
moment
that
he
sent
sheremetief
who
found
the
swedes
just
debouching
into
the
valley
received
several
volleys
of
and
retired
in
disorder
the
mad
venture
had
succeeded
but
charles
farther
advance
involved
the
playing
of
a
risky
game
his
men
were
worn
out
his
horses
had
not
been
fed
for
two
whole
days
still
he
went
on
he
reached
narva
formed
his
swedes
into
several
attacking
columns
led
one
himself
and
favored
by
a
sudden
hurricane
which
drove
showers
of
blinding
snow
into
his
adversaries
faces
threw
himself
into
their
camp
and
mastered
the
place
in
half
an
hour
the
only
resistance
he
met
was
offered
by
the
two
regiments
of
the
guard
all
the
rest
fled
or
surrendered
a
few
russians
were
drowned
in
the
narva
if
the
river
had
been
frozen
said
charles
discontentedly
i
do
not
know
that
we
should
have
contrived
to
kill
a
single
man
it
was
a
total
breakdown
the
army
had
disappeared
and
the
artillery
the
very
sovereign
was
gone
and
with
him
the
country
honor
that
had
sunk
out
of
sight
amid
the
scornful
laughter
with
which
europe
hailed
this
undignified
defeat
the
czar
was
in
full
flight
all
peter
plans
of
conquest
his
dreams
of
european
expansion
and
of
navigating
the
northern
seas
his
hopes
of
glory
his
faith
in
his
civilizing
mission
had
utterly
faded
and
he
himself
had
collapsed
upon
their
ruins
onward
he
fled
feeling
the
swedish
soldiers
on
his
heels
he
wept
he
sued
for
peace
vowing
he
would
treat
at
once
and
submit
to
any
sacrifice
he
sent
imploring
appeals
to
the
of
holland
to
england
and
to
the
emperor
praying
for
mediation
but
swiftly
he
recovered
possession
of
his
faculties
then
raising
his
head
through
the
golden
haze
with
which
his
insufficient
education
the
infatuation
inherent
to
his
origin
and
his
inexperience
had
filled
his
eyes
through
the
rent
of
that
mighty
catastrophe
and
that
cruel
lesson
he
saw
and
touched
the
truth
at
last
he
realized
what
he
must
set
himself
to
do
if
he
was
to
become
that
which
he
fain
would
be
there
must
be
no
more
playing
at
soldiers
and
sailors
no
more
of
that
farce
of
power
and
glory
in
which
till
now
he
had
been
the
chief
actor
no
more
aimless
adventure
undertaken
in
utter
scorn
of
time
and
place
he
must
toil
now
in
downright
earnest
he
must
go
forward
step
by
step
measure
each
effort
calculate
each
morrow
task
let
each
fruit
ripen
ere
he
essayed
to
pluck
it
learn
patience
and
dogged
perseverance
he
did
it
all
he
found
means
within
him
and
about
him
to
carry
out
his
task
the
strong
race
of
which
he
came
endowed
him
with
the
necessary
qualities
and
gave
him
its
own
inexhaustible
and
devotion
and
ten
armies
may
be
destroyed
he
will
bring
up
ten
others
to
replace
them
no
matter
what
the
price
his
people
will
follow
him
and
die
beside
him
to
the
last
man
to
the
last
morsel
of
bread
snatched
from
its
starving
jaws
a
month
hence
the
fugitive
from
narva
will
belong
to
a
vanished
forgotten
almost
improbable
past
the
future
victor
of
poltava
will
have
taken
his
place
of
the
russian
army
as
it
had
originally
taken
the
field
about
thousand

remained
a
certain
number

he
melted

in

the

raised
the
cry
of
sacrilege
he
never
faltered
for
a
moment
he
went
hither
and
thither
giving
orders
and
active
help
rating
some
encouraging
others
inspiring
everyone
with
some
of
his
own
energy
that
energy
which
his
misfortune
had
spurred
and
strengthened
yet
byzantine
as
he
was
by
nature
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
endeavor
to
mislead

opinion
matvieief

orders
to

up
his

had
desired
to
pay
their

to

europe
only
laughed
but
in
later
years
this
pretended
capitulation
and
the
supposed
swedish
violation
of
it
were
to
serve
peter
as
a
pretext
for
violating
others
to
which
he
himself
had
willingly
consented

when

inquired
what
conditions
the

hoped
to
obtain
from

adversary
the

calmly
claimed
the
greater
part
of
livonia
with

thought
it
perfectly
justifiable
so
long
as
the
king
had
not
rid
himself
of
augustus
by
means
of
the
peace
which
this
prince
appeared
more
than
willing
to
negotiate
through
the
mediation
of
guiscard
himself
but
charles
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
french
diplomat
prayers
and
remonstrances
he
feared
declared
guiscard
he
might
run
short
of
enemies
and
as
he
could
not
advance
on
russia
and
leave
the
saxons
and
poles
in
his
rear
he
desired
and
here
doubtless
he
was
right
first
of
all
to
insure
his
line
of
communication
and
of
possible
retreat
thus
by
his
own
deed
he
strengthened
and
cemented
an
alliance
which
had
already
been
shaken
by
common
defeat
augustus
repulsed
by
the
swedish
king
threw
himself
into
peter
arms
and
in
february
the
common
destinies
of
the
czar
and
the
king
of
poland
were
once
more
bound
together
a
fresh
treaty
was
signed
at
the
castle
of
birze
close
to
dunaburg
the
year
was
a
hard
one
for
peter
the
junction
between
the
army
which
he
had
contrived
after
some
fashion
to
put
on
a
war
footing
and
the
saxon
troops
of
augustus
only
resulted
in
the
complete
defeat
of
the
allied
forces
under
the
walls
of
riga
on
july
in
the
month
of
june
the
moscow
kremlin
caught
fire
the
state
offices
with
their
archives
the
and
palaces
were
all
devoured
by
the
flames
the
bells
fell
from
the
tower
of
ivan
the
great
and
the
heaviest
which
weighed
over
a
hundred
tons
was
broken
in
the
fall
but
in
midwinter
sheremetief
contrived
to
surprise
schlippenbach
with
a
superior
force
and
defeated
him
at
erestfer
december
peter
delight
and
his
wild
manifestations
of
triumph
may
easily
be
imagined
he
did
not
content
himself
with
exhibiting
the
few
swedish
prisoners
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
at
moscow
in
a
sort
of
imitation
roman
triumph
his
practical
mind
incited
him
to
make
use
of
them
in
another
way
and
cornelius
von
bruyn
who
had
lived
long
enough
in
the
country
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
its
customs
calmly
reports
that
the
price
of
war
captives
which
had
originally
been
three
or
four
florins
a
head
rose
as
high
as
twenty
and
thirty
florins
even
foreigners
now
ventured
to
purchase
them
and
entered
into
competition
in
the
open
market
on
july
sheremetief
won
a
fresh
victory
over
schlippenbach
russians
defeated
swedes
according
to
official
account
of
the
battle
of
his
enemies
were
left
dead
on
the
field
while
sheremetief
lost
only
men
this
report
made
europe
smile
but
the
livonians
found
it
no
laughing
matter
volmar
and
marienburg
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victor
who
ravaged
the
country
in
the
most
frightful
fashion
the
russians
had
not
as
yet
learned
any
other
form
of
warfare
and
as
we
may
suppose
the
idea
that
he
might
ever
possess
these
territories
had
not
yet
occurred
to
peter
his
mind
indeed
was
absorbed
elsewhere
his
old
fancies
and
whims
were
strong
upon
him
and
he
left
apraxin
to
rage
on
the
banks
of
the
neva
in
ingria
on
the
very
spot
where
his
future
capital
was
to
stand
while
he
himself
gave
all
his
time
and
strength
to
the
building
of
a
few
wretched
ships
at
archangel
it
was
not
till
september
when
the
ice
had
driven
him
out
of
the
northern
port
that
he
returned
to
the
west
and
took
up
his
former
course
he
reached
the
lake
of
ladoga
sent
for
sheremetief
and
the
end
he
was
to
pursue
for
many
a
long
year
seems
at
last
to
have
taken
firm
root
in
his
hitherto
unstable
mind
he
laid
siege
to
noteburg
where
he
found
a
garrison
of
only
four
hundred
fifty
men
and
on
december
he
rechristened
the
little
fortress
he
had
captured
by
a
new
and
symbolic
name
schluesselburg
key
of
the
sea
next
came
the
capture
of
nienschantz
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
neva
in
april
a
personal
success
for
the
captain
of
bombardiers
peter
mikhailoff
who
there
brought
his
batteries
into
play
a
month
later
the
artilleryman
had
become
a
sailor
and
had
won
russia
first
naval
victory
two
regiments
of
the
guard
manned
thirty
boats
surrounded
two
small
swedish
vessels
which
in
their
ignorance
of
the
capture
of
nienschantz
had
ventured
close
to
the
town
took
possession
of
them
and
murdered
their
crews
the
victor
letters
to
his
friends
are
full
of
the
wildest
and
most
childish
delight
and
there
was
we
must
admit
some
reason
for
this
joy
he
had
reconquered
the
historic
estuary
through
which
in
the
ninth
century
the
first
varegs
had
passed
southward
toward
grecian
skies
on
the
of
the
following
may
wooden
houses
began
to
rise
on
one
of
the
neighboring
islets
these
houses
were
to
multiply
to
grow
into
palaces
and
finally
to
be
known
as
petersburg
peter
conquests
and
newly
founded
cities
disturbed
charles
xii
but
little
let
him
build
towns
there
will
be
all
the
more
for
us
to
take
peter
and
his
army
had
so
far
where
charles
was
concerned
had
to
do
only
with
small
detachments
of
troops
scattered
apart
and
thus
foredoomed
to
destruction
the
russians
took
advantage
of
this
fact
to
pursue
their
successes
strengthening
and
intrenching
themselves
both
in
ingria
and
livonia
in
july
peter
was
present
at
the
taking
of
derpt
in
august
he
had
his
revenge
for
his
disaster
at
narva
and
carried
the
town
after
a
murderous
assault
already
in
november
a
guest
had
appeared
in
the
mouth
of
the
neva
a
foreign
laden
with
brandy
and
salt
menshikoff
the
governor
of
entertained
the
captain
at
a
banquet
and
presented
him
with
five
hundred
florins
for
himself
and
thirty
crowns
for
each
of
his
sailors
meanwhile
charles
xii
tarried
in
poland
where
augustus
affairs
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
a
diet
convened
at
warsaw
in
february
proclaimed
his
downfall
after
the
disappearance
of
james
sobieski
whose
candidature
was
put
a
stop
to
by
an
ambuscade
into
which
the
dethroned
king
lured
the
son
of
the
deliverer
of
vienna
charles
who
was
put
forward
that
of
stanislaus
lesczynski
though
he
gave
little
thought
just
then
to
russia
and
to
the
russian
sovereign
the
czar
was
beginning
to
be
alarmed
as
to
the
consequences
which
the
swedish
king
position
in
poland
and
in
saxony
might
entail
on
himself
charles
was
sure
to
end
by
retracing
his
steps
and
an
encounter
between
sheremetief
and
loewenhaupt
at
hemauerthorf
in
courland
july
clearly
proved
that
the
russian
army
unless
in
the
case
of
disproportionate
numerical
superiority
over
the
enemy
was
not
yet
capable
of
resisting
swedish
troops
on
this
occasion
sheremetief
lost
all
his
infantry
and
was
himself
severely
wounded
what
then
was
peter
to
do
he
must
work
on
increase
his
resources
and
add
to
his
experience
if
sheremetief
and
his
likes
proved
unequal
to
their
task
he
must
find
foreign
generals
and
instructors
technical
and
other
he
must
keep
patience
he
must
avoid
all
perilous
encounters
he
must
negotiate
and
try
to
obtain
peace
even
at
the
price
of
parting
with
some
of
the
territory
he
had
conquered
the
years
between
and
were
busy
ones
for
him
a
treaty
of
peace
among
his
enemies
took
him
by
surprise
and
found
him
quite
unprepared
he
soon
made
good
his
mistakes
took
a
swift
decision
and
adopted
the
course
which
was
infallibly
to
bring
him
final
victory
he
evacuated
poland
retired
backward
and
pushing
forward
the
preparations
which
charles
long
stay
in
saxony
had
permitted
him
to
carry
on
with
great
activity
he
resolved
that
the
battle
should
be
fought
on
his
ground
and
at
his
chosen
time
he
took
fresh
patience
he
resolved
to
wait
to
wear
out
his
adversary
to
draw
back
steadily
and
leave
nothing
but
a
void
behind
him
thus
he
would
force
the
enemy
to
advance
across
the
desert
plains
he
had
deliberately
devastated
and
run
the
terrible
risk
which
had
always
driven
back
the
ancient
foes
of
his
country
whether
turks
tartars
or
poles
a
winter
sojourn
in
the
heart
of
russia
this
was
to
be
the
final
round
of
the
great
fight
the
czar
as
he
expressed
it
was
to
set
ten
russians
against
every
swede
and
time
and
space
and
cold
and
hunger
were
to
be
his
backers
charles
the
most
taciturn
general
who
ever
lived
never
revealed
the
secret
inspiration
which
drove
him
to
play
his
adversary
game
by
marching
afresh
on
grodno
during
he
seemed
to
give
the
law
to
europe
from
his
camp
in
saxony
france
which
had
been
vanquished
at
blenheim
and
ramillies
turned
a
pleading
glance
toward
him
and
the
leader
of
the
victorious
allies
marlborough
himself
solicited
his
help
charles
may
have
had
an
idea
of
making
grodno
his
base
for
a
spring
attack
on
the
czar
new
conquests
in
the
north
this
supposition
would
seem
to
have
been
the
one
accepted
by
peter
if
we
may
judge
by
the
orders
given
just
at
this
time
to
insure
the
safety
of
livonia
and
ingria
by
completing
their
devastation
and
these
very
orders
may
have
induced
the
king
of
sweden
to
abandon
his
original
design
in
favor
of
another
the
wisdom
of
which
is
still
contested
by
experts
but
which
it
can
not
be
denied
was
of
noble
proportions
charles
too
had
found
an
ally
to
set
against
those
natural
ones
with
which
russia
had
furnished
the
czar
and
he
had
found
him
within
the
borders
of
the
czar
country
the
name
of
this
ally
was
mazeppa
the
stormy
career
of
the
famous
hetman
so
dramatic
both
from
the
historic
and
domestic
point
of
view
from
that
adventure
with
the
falbowski
so
naively
related
by
pasek
down
to
the
romance
with
matrena
kotchoubey
which
colored
the
last
and
tragic
incidents
of
his
existence
is
so
well
known
that
i
will
not
narrate
it
here
even
in
the
concisest
form
little
russia
was
then
passing
through
a
painful
crisis
the
consequence
of
shmielnicki
efforts
at
emancipation
which
had
been
warped
and
perverted
by
russian
intervention
the
polish
lords
who
formerly
oppressed
the
country
had
been
replaced
by
the
cossacks
who
not
only
ground
down
the
native
population
but
railed
at
and
quarrelled
with
their
own
chief
the
hetmans
and
the
irregular
troops
were
at
open
war
the
first
striving
to
increase
their
authority
and
make
their
power
hereditary
the
others
defending
their
ancient
democratic
constitution
the
swedish
war
increased
mazeppa
difficulties
he
found
himself
taken
at
a
disadvantage
between
the
claims
of
the
czar
who
would
fain
have
his
cossacks
on
every
in
poland
russia
and
livonia
and
the
resistance
of
the
cossacks
themselves
who
desired
to
remain
in
their
own
country
being
himself
of
noble
polish
birth
brought
up
by
the
jesuits
having
served
king
john
casimir
of
poland
and
sworn
allegiance
to
the
sultan
he
saw
no
reason
for
sacrificing
his
interests
much
less
his
life
for
peter
benefit
the
approach
of
charles
xii
made
him
fear
he
might
like
his
predecessor
nalevaiko
be
deserted
by
his
own
followers
and
given
up
to
the
poles
the
appearance
of
charles
on
the
russian
frontier
forced
him
to
a
definite
resolution
and
in
the
spring
of
his
emissaries
appeared
at
radoshkovitse
southeast
of
grodno
where
charles
had
established
his
the
king
of
sweden
idea
at
that
decisive
moment
would
seem
to
have
been
to
take
advantage
of
the
hetman
friendly
inclination
to
find
his
way
into
the
heart
of
russia
using
the
rich
southern
provinces
as
his
base
to
stir
up
with
mazeppa
help
the
don
cossacks
the
astrakhan
tartars
and
it
may
have
been
the
turks
themselves
and
thus
attack
the
muscovite
power
in
the
rear
then
peter
would
have
been
forced
back
upon
his
last
intrenchments
at
moscow
or
elsewhere
while
general
luebecker
who
was
in
finland
with
fourteen
thousand
men
fell
on
ingria
and
on
petersburg
and
leszcynski
polish
partisans
with
general
krassow
swedes
held
poland
it
was
a
mighty
plan
indeed
but
at
the
very
outset
it
was
sharply
checked
mazeppa
insisted
on
certain
conditions
and
these
conditions
charles
thought
too
heavy
the
hetman
agreed
that
poland
should
take
the
ukraine
and
white
russia
and
that
the
swedes
should
have
the
fortresses
of
mglin
starodoub
and
but
he
himself
insisted
on
being
apportioned
polotsk
vitebsk
and
the
whole
of
courland
to
be
held
in
fief
thus
the
negotiations
were
delayed
meanwhile
charles
perceiving
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
make
a
forward
movement
made
up
his
mind
to
send
for
loewenhaupt
who
was
in
livonia
and
who
was
to
bring
him
sixteen
thousand
men
and
various
stores
but
the
swedish
hero
had
not
reckoned
fairly
with
distance
and
with
time
many
precious
days
the
best
of
the
season
fled
by
before
his
orders
could
be
obeyed
and
for
the
first
time
he
showed
signs
of
uncertainty
and
irresolution
which
were
all
too
quickly
communicated
to
those
under
his
command
loewenhaupt
grew
slower
than
usual
luebecker
slackened
his
activity
and
mazeppa
began
to
play
his
double
game
again
prudently
preparing
his
cossacks
to
revolt
in
the
name
of
the
ancient
customs
national
privileges
and
church
laws
which
peter
reforms
had
infringed
fortifying
his
own
residence
at
batourin
and
accumulating
immense
stores
there
but
still
continuing
to
pay
court
to
the
czar
wearing
the
german
dress
flattering
the
despotic
taste
by
suggesting
plans
which
would
have
annihilated
the
last
vestiges
of
local
independence
and
accepting
gifts
sent
him
by
menshikoff
and
so
the
summer
passed
away
a
winter
campaign
became
inevitable
and
the
abyss
which
peter
unerring
eye
had
scanned
began
to
gape
it
was
not
till
june
that
charles
xii
left
radoshkovitse
and
marched
eastward
to
borisov
where
he
crossed
the
berezina
menshikoff
and
sheremetief
made
an
attempt
to
stop
him
on
july
as
he
was
crossing
a
small
river
called
the
bibitch
near
holovtchin
a
night
manoeuvre
and
a
wild
bayonet
charge
led
by
the
king
himself
carried
him
once
more
to
victory
the
town
of
mohilef
opened
its
gates
to
the
swedes
but
there
charles
was
forced
to
stay
and
lose
more
time
yet
waiting
for
loewenhaupt
he
marched
again
early
in
august
in
a
southerly
direction
and
his
soldiers
soon
found
themselves
in
the
grip
of
one
of
peter
allies
they
were
driven
to
support
themselves
by
gathering
ears
of
corn
which
they
ground
between
two
stones
sickness
began
to
thin
their
ranks
their
three
doctors
so
the
fierce
troopers
said
were
brandy
garlic
and
death
loewenhaupt
had
reached
shklof
and
was
separated
from
the
invading
army
by
two
streams
the
soja
and
the
dnieper
between
which
peter
had
taken
up
his
position
the
swedish
general
after
having
successfully
passed
the
dnieper
was
met
at
liesna
on
october
by
a
force
three
times
as
large
as
his
own
and
peter
was
able
on
the
following
day
to
report
a
complete
victory
to
his
friends
men
dead
on
the
field
without
mentioning
those
the
kalmucks
have
hunted
into
the
forest
and
prisoners
according
to
this
reckoning
loewenhaupt
who
could
not
have
brought
more
than
troops
into
action
should
have
been
left
without
a
man
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
reached
charles
with
after
a
flank
march
which
all
military
experts
consider
a
marvel
but
not
being
able
to
find
a
bridge
across
the
soja
he
was
forced
to
abandon
his
artillery
and
all
his
baggage
and
he
led
his
starving
troops
into
a
camp
there
was
bad
news
too
from
ingria
where
luebecker
had
also
been
defeated
losing
all
his
baggage
and
three
thousand
troops
charles
grew
so
disconcerted
that
he
is
reported
to
have
confessed
to
gyllenkrook
his
that
he
was
all
at
sea
and
no
longer
had
any
definite
plan
on
october
he
reached
mokoshin
on
the
desna
on
the
borders
of
the
ukraine
where
he
had
expected
to
meet
mazeppa
but
the
old
leader
broke
his
appointment
he
still
desired
to
temporize
and
was
loath
to
take
any
decisive
resolution
he
was
driven
to
take
one
at
last
by
the
cossacks
about
him
who
were
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
the
russians
following
the
swedes
into
the
ukraine
it
would
be
far
better
so
they
thought
to
join
the
latter
against
the
former
one
of
these
cossacks
voinarovski
who
had
been
sent
by
the
hetman
to
menshikoff
had
returned
with
most
terrifying
news
he
had
overheard
the
german
officers
on
the
favorite
staff
speaking
of
mazeppa
and
his
followers
say
god
pity
those
poor
wretches
they
will
all
be
in
chains
mazeppa
when
he
heard
this
report
raged
like
a
whirlwind
hurried
to
batourin
to
give
the
alarm
and
then
crossed
the
desna
and
joined
the
swedish
army
it
was
too
late
the
popular
sentiment
on
which
both
he
and
charles
had
reckoned
to
promote
an
insurrectionary
movement
confused
by
the
tergiversations
and
the
ambiguous
actions
of
the
hetman
had
quite
gone
astray
and
lost
all
consistency
all
mazeppa
could
reckon
upon
was
a
body
of
two
thousand
faithful
troops
not
enough
even
to
defend
batourin
which
menshikoff
snatched
from
him
a
few
days
later
thus
depriving
the
swedish
army
of
its
last
chance
of
revictualling
when
the
fortresses
of
starodoub
and
closed
their
gates
against
him
the
whole
of
the
ukraine
slipped
from
the
grasp
of
the
turncoat
chief
and
his
new
allies
his
effigy
was
first
hung
and
then
dragged
through
the
streets
of
glouhof
in
peter
presence
another
hetman
skoropadski
was
appointed
in
his
place
and
then
came
winter
a
cruel
winter
during
which
the
very
birds
died
of
cold
by
the
beginning
of
charles
effective
strength
had
dwindled
to
nearly
twenty
thousand
men
the
russians
did
not
dare
to
attack
him
as
yet
but
they
gathered
round
him
in
an
circle
they
carried
his
advanced
posts
they
cut
his
lines
of
communication
the
king
of
sweden
to
get
himself
mere
was
driven
to
begin
his
campaign
in
the
month
of
january
he
lost
one
thousand
men
and
officers
in
taking
the
paltry
town
of
wespjik
january
by
this
time
the
game
in
view
was
already
lost
and
he
made
an
attempt
to
turn
his
coat
again
offering
to
betray
charles
into
peter
hands
if
peter
would
restore
him
his
office
the
bargain
was
struck
but
a
letter
from
the
old
traitor
addressed
to
leszcynski
chanced
to
fall
into
the
czar
hands
and
made
him
draw
back
in
the
conviction
that
mazeppa
was
utterly
unreliable
in
march
the
near
approach
of
the
swedish
army
then
advancing
on
poltava
induced
the
zaporoje
cossacks
to
join
it
but
the
movement
was
a
very
partial
one
and
peter
soon
put
it
down
by
means
of
a
series
of
military
executions
mercilessly
carried
out
by
menshikoff
and
of
various
manifestoes
against
the
foreign
heretics
who
deny
the
doctrines
of
the
true
religion
and
spit
on
the
picture
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
capture
of
poltava
thus
became
the
last
hope
of
charles
and
his
army
if
they
could
not
seize
the
town
they
must
all
die
of
hunger
the
fortifications
of
the
place
were
weak
but
the
besieging
army
was
sorely
changed
from
that
which
had
fought
under
the
walls
of
narva
it
had
spent
too
long
a
time
in
fat
quarters
in
saxony
and
poland
to
be
fit
to
endure
this
terrible
campaign
like
the
russian
army
at
narva
it
was
sapped
by
demoralization
before
it
was
called
on
to
do
any
serious
fighting
even
among
the
swedish
staff
and
in
the
king
intimate
circle
all
confidence
in
his
genius
and
his
lucky
star
had
disappeared
his
best
generals
rehnskold
and
gyllenkrook
his
chancellor
piper
and
mazeppa
himself
were
against
any
prolongation
of
the
siege
which
promised
to
be
a
long
one
if
god
were
to
send
down
one
of
his
angels
he
said
to
induce
me
to
follow
your
advice
i
would
not
listen
to
him
an
ineradicable
illusion
the
fruit
of
the
too
easy
victories
of
his
early
career
prompted
him
to
undervalue
the
forces
opposed
to
him
he
knew
and
would
acknowledge
nothing
of
that
new
russia
the
mighty
upstanding
colossus
which
peter
had
at
last
succeeded
in
raising
up
in
his
path
according
to
some
authorities
mazeppa
in
his
desire
to
replace
batourin
by
poltava
as
his
own
personal
appanage
encouraged
him
in
this
fatal
resolution
but
it
may
well
have
been
that
retreat
had
already
become
impossible
it
was
long
before
peter
made
up
his
mind
to
intervene
he
was
still
distrustful
of
himself
desperately
eager
to
increase
his
own
resources
and
with
them
his
chances
of
victory
on
his
enemy
side
everything
contributed
to
this
result
by
the
end
of
june
all
the
swedish
ammunition
was
exhausted
the
invaders
could
use
none
of
their
artillery
and
hardly
any
of
their
and
were
reduced
to
fighting
with
cold
steel
on
the
very
eve
of
the
decisive
struggle
they
were
left
without
a
leader
during
a
reconnaissance
on
the
banks
of
the
vorskla
which
ran
between
the
hostile
armies
charles
always
rash
and
apt
to
expose
himself
unnecessarily
was
struck
by
a
bullet
it
is
only
in
the
foot
he
said
smiling
and
continued
his
examination
of
the
ground
but
when
he
returned
to
camp
he
fainted
and
peter
reckoning
on
the
moral
effect
of
the
accident
at
once
resolved
to
cross
the
river
a
report
as
a
matter
of
fact
ran
through
the
swedish
camp
that
the
king
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
had
deliberately
sought
death
yet
ten
more
days
passed
by
in
the
expectation
of
an
attack
which
the
russians
did
not
dare
to
make
it
was
charles
who
took
action
at
last
informing
his
generals
on
june
july
that
he
would
give
battle
on
the
following
morning
he
himself
was
still
in
a
very
suffering
condition
and
made
over
the
command
to
rehnskold
a
valiant
soldier
but
a
doubtful
leader
for
he
did
not
possess
the
army
confidence
and
according
to
lundblad
hid
his
lack
of
knowledge
and
strategical
powers
under
gloomy
looks
and
a
fierce
expression
after
the
event
as
was
so
commonly
the
case
with
vanquished
generals
he
was
accused
of
treachery
the
truth
would
seem
to
be
that
charles
obstinate
reserve
and
habit
of
never
confiding
his
plans
and
military
arrangements
to
any
third
person
had
ended
by
gradually
depriving
his
lieutenants
of
all
power
of
independent
action
in
his
presence
they
were
bereft
of
speech
and
almost
of
ideas
all
rehnskold
did
was
to
rage
and
swear
at
everyone
peter
meanwhile
neglected
nothing
likely
to
insure
success
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
dress
the
novgorod
regiment
one
of
his
best
in
the
coarse
cloth
siermiaga
generally
reserved
for
newly
joined
recruits
in
the
hope
of
thus
deceiving
the
enemy
this
stratagem
however
completely
failed
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
battle
rehnskold
fell
on
the
regiment
and
cut
it
to
pieces
the
russian
centre
was
confided
to
sheremetief
the
right
wing
to
general
ronne
the
left
to
menshikoff
bruce
commanded
the
artillery
and
the
czar
as
usual
retired
modestly
to
the
head
of
a
single
regiment
but
this
was
a
mere
disguise
in
real
fact
he
was
everywhere
going
hither
and
thither
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
and
lavishing
effort
in
every
direction
a
bullet
passed
through
his
hat
another
is
said
to
have
struck
him
full
on
the
breast
it
was
miraculously
stopped
by
a
golden
cross
set
with
precious
stones
given
by
the
monks
on
mount
athos
to
the
czar
feodor
and
which
his
successor
habitually
wore
this
cross
which
certainly
bears
the
mark
of
some
projectile
is
still
preserved
in
the
ouspienski
monastery
at
moscow
the
heroism
and
sovereign
contempt
of
death
betrayed
by
charles
were
worthy
of
himself
unable
to
sit
a
horse
he
caused
himself
to
be
carried
on
a
litter
which
when
it
was
shattered
by
bullets
was
replaced
by
another
made
of
crossed
lances
but
he
was
nothing
but
a
living
standard
useless
though
sublime
the
once
mighty
military
leader
had
utterly
disappeared
the
battle
was
but
a
wild
conflict
in
which
the
glorious
remnants
of
one
of
the
most
splendid
armies
that
had
ever
been
brought
together
unable
to
use
its
arms
leaderless
hopeless
of
victory
and
soon
overwhelmed
and
crushed
by
superior
numbers
struggled
for
a
space
with
the
sole
object
of
remaining
faithful
to
its
king
at
the
end
of
two
hours
charles
himself
left
the
field
of
battle
he
had
been
lifted
onto
the
back
of
an
old
horse
which
his
father
had
formerly
ridden
and
which
was
called
run
to
the
fire
because
he
was
always
saddled
when
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
city
this
charger
followed
the
vanquished
hero
into
turkey
was
taken
by
the
turks
at

sent
back
to
the
king
taken
again
at
stralsund
in

to
its
owner
once
more

died
in
the
same
year
as
his
master
at
the
age
of
poniatowski
the
father
of
the
future
king
of
poland
who
was
following
the
campaign
as
a
volunteer
charles
had
refused
to
take
any
polish
troops
with
him
on
account
of
their
want
of
discipline
rallied
one
of
colonel
horn
squadrons
to
escort
the
king
and
received
seventeen
bullets
through
his
leather
kaftan
while
covering
the
royal
retreat

rehnskold
piper
the
chancellor
with
all
his
subordinates
over
one
hundred
fifty
officers
and
two
thousand
soldiers
fell
into
the
victor
hands
the
russians
joy
was
so
extreme
that
they
forgot
to
pursue
the
retreating
enemy
their
first
impulse
was
to
sit
down
and
banquet
peter
invited
the
more
important
prisoners
to
his
own
table
and
toasted
the
health
of
his
masters
in
the
art
of
war
the
swedes
who
still
numbered
thirteen
thousand
men
had
time
to
pause
for
a
moment
in
their
own
camp
where
charles
summoned
loewenhaupt
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
heard
to
ask
for
advice
what
was
to
be
done
the
general
counselled
him
to
burn
all
wagons
mount
his
infantry
soldiers
on
the
and
beat
a
retreat
toward
the
dnieper
on
june
the
russians
came
up
with
the
swedish
army
at
perevolotchna
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
soldiers
refusing
to
fight
again
loewenhaupt
capitulated
but
the
king
had
time
to
cross
to
the
other
side
two
boats
lashed
together
carried
his
carriage
a
few
officers
and
the
which
he
had
filled
in

mazeppa
contrived
to
find
a
boat
for
himself
and
loaded
it
with
two
barrels
of
gold
at
kiev
whither
peter
proceeded
from
poltava

up

the
recent

in
a

flight

when
our

hear
of
what
has
happened
they
will
say
it
was
not
into
a
foreign
country
that
the
swedish
army
and
the
swedish
power
ventured
but
rather
into
some
mighty
sea
they
have
fallen
in
and
disappeared

indeed
disappeared
charles

a
touch
of

about
it

dashing

port

was
restored
to

much
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
english
colonists
who
saw
clearly
that
as
soon
as
another

arose
they
would
have
to
make
the
assault
again

by

murderous

fortress

was
renamed

royal
in
honor
of
queen
anne
in
perusing
the
history
of
nova
scotia
the
reader
is
struck
with
the
frequency
with
which
the
country
or
in
other
words
the
forts
passed
from
the
french
to
the
english
and
as
a
rule
permanent
retention
was
not
contemplated
hence
we
find
that
when
port
royal
was
taken
by
phips
he
departed
without
leaving
a
solitary
man
to
defend
it
a
few
days
after
the
expedition
had
left
the
chevalier
de
villebon
the
newly
appointed
french
governor
arrived
and
if
accompanied
by
the
means
had
a
favorable
opportunity
of
putting
it
once
more
in
a
state
of
defence
and
retaining
it
as
a
french
stronghold
but
phips
was
not
far
off
and
he
therefore
deemed
it
prudent
considering
the
small
force
at
his
disposal
to
retire
to
the
river
john
where
he
remained
for
some
years
destroying
new
england
vessels
and
organizing
schemes
for
the
consolidation
of
french
authority
in
the
province
in
the
mean
time
villebon
showed
his
temper
toward
the
new
englanders
by
building
a
chapel
on
the
disputed
territory
and
driving
their
fishermen
from
the
coast
of
nova
scotia
villebon
was
succeeded
by
brouillan
in
and
not
only
was
an
enemy
to
the
fishermen
but
actually
afforded
protection
to
pirates
who
preyed
on
the
trade
of
massachusetts
which
inspired
a
degree
of
hostility
in
new
england
that
on
the
accession
of
queen
anne
in
the
declaration
of
war
which
followed
was
hailed
in
that
colony
with
demonstrations
of
joy
the
new
englanders
had
a
long
catalogue
of
grievances
unredressed
hostile
attacks
unrevenged
and
were
more
determined
than
ever
to
put
forth
their
strength
for
the
expulsion
of
the
french
from
the
province
in
a
preliminary
expedition
was
despatched
by
them
to
the
coast
of
nova
scotia
consisting
of
a
ship
of
and
another
of
guns
a
number
of
transports
and
on
board
of
which
were
upward
of
five
hundred
men
under
the
command
of
colonel
church
whose
instructions
were
to
destroy
settlements
and
where
dams
existed
to
deluge
the
cultivated
ground
and
make
as
many
prisoners
as
possible
one
detachment
visited
minas
and
spread
desolation
and
ruin
in
that
fertile
region
through
which
brouillan
passed
on
his
way
to
annapolis
representing
the
people
as
living
like
true
republicans
not
acknowledging
royal
or
judicial
authority
and
able
to
spare
eight
hundred
hogsheads
of
wheat
yearly
for
exportation
and
as
being
supplied
with
abundance
of
cattle
another
detachment
went
to
port
royal
which
they
deemed
it
prudent
not
to
attack
brouillan
having
died
in
subercase
was
appointed
governor
in
the
spring
of
another
expedition
was
sent
from
new
england
to
attack
port
royal
it
consisted
of
transports
and
the
province
galley
convoyed
by
a
of
fifty
guns
on
which
were
embarked
two
regiments
of
militia
under
colonels
wainwright
and
hilton
the
expedition
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
port
royal
on
june
a
landing
was
soon
effected
but
subercase
dispositions
for
resistance
were
so
able
that
the
english
found
it
impossible
to
make
any
impression
on
the
defences
and
after
losing
eighty
men
the
troops
were
reembarked
and
proceeded
to
casco
bay
from
which
place
the
commanders
communicated
with
the
governor
of
new
england
and
waited
orders
the
failure
of
the
expedition
caused
great
indignation
in
new
england
and
the
governor
immediately
resolved
to
strengthen
the
army
with
a
hundred
recruits
and
to
order
a
second
attack
accordingly
the
expedition
again
sailed
for
port
royal
when
subercase
was
in
a
far
more
formidable
position
than
formerly
after
a
siege
of
fifteen
days
in
which
the
english
officers
displayed
unaccountable
cowardice
the
ships
retired
having
lost
sixteen
men
while
the
french
had
only
three
men
killed
and
wounded
subercase
immediately
proceeded
to
strengthen
his
position
in
anticipation
of
a
third
attack
a
powder
magazine
was
accordingly
constructed
capable
of
containing
sixty
thousand
pounds
of
powder
and
the
fort
was
otherwise
improved
this
governor
who
had
formed
a
high
estimate
of
the
climate
soil
and
general
resources
of
the
province
was
one
of
the
ablest
appointed
under
french
rule
he
made
urgent
appeals
to
the
french
government
to
colonize
the
country
on
a
large
scale
pointing
out
the
advantages
that
would
follow
but
all
his
suggestions
were
disregarded
and
he
had
the
mortification
notwithstanding
his
zeal
and
personal
sacrifices
in
the
service
of
his
country
to
receive
less
encouragement
and
support
from
the
home
government
than
any
of
his
predecessors
in
the
year
great
preparations
were
made
for
the
conquest
of
canada
and
nova
scotia
the
new
york
house
of
assembly
sent
a
petition
to
queen
anne
praying
for
such
assistance
as
would
expel
the
french
entirely
from
the
country
colonel
vetch
is
said
to
have
inspired
this
application
and
to
have
submitted
to
the
british
government
a
plan
of
attack
promises
of
liberal
support
are
said
to
have
been
made
which
however
the
government
was
tardy
in
affording
the
command
of
the
new
england
forces
was
intrusted
to
francis
nicholson
who
was
appointed
governor
of
new
england
under
sir
edmund
andros
in
being
governor
of
new
york
in
and
in
the
following
year
of
virginia
in
he
was
transferred
to
the
government
of
maryland
and
in
sent
back
to
virginia
as
at
which
time
he
held
the
rank
of
colonel
in
the
army
nicholson
was
an
earnest
advocate
of
a
confederation
of
the
british
north
american
provinces
for
purposes
of
defence
to
which
the
people
of
virginia
were
popularly
opposed
nicholson
sailed
from
boston
on
september
with
a
fleet
of
about
vessels
including
five
transports
from
england
conveying
a
considerable
force
composed
of
troops
supplied
by
massachusetts
connecticut
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
which
arrived
at
port
royal
on
september
subercase
was
not
in
a
condition
to
resist
so
formidable
a
force
hence
we
find
him
writing
to
the
french
minister
that
the
garrison
is
dispirited
and
praying
for
assistance
in
men
and
money
the
strait
to
which
he
was
reduced
is
indicated
by
the
following
passage
i
have
had
means
he
says
by
my
industry
to
borrow
wherewith
to
subsist
the
garrison
for
these
two
years
i
have
paid
what
i
could
by
selling
all
my
movables
i
will
give
even
to
my
last
shirt
but
i
fear
that
all
my
pains
will
prove
useless
if
we
are
not
succored
during
the
month
of
march
or
early
in
april
supposing
the
enemy
should
let
us
rest
this
winter
but
it
was
far
from
the
intention
of
the
enemy
to
let
them
rest
for
three
days
after
the
despatch
of
the
communication
in
which
the
passage
quoted
occurred
nicholson
sent
a
summons
to
the
governor
requiring
the
immediate
delivery
of
the
fort
and
in
the
event
of
expressing
his
resolution
to
reduce
it
by
force
of
her
majesty
arms
no
reply
having
been
sent
to
the
summons
nicholson
prepared
to
land
his
troops
to
which
subercase
offered
no
resistance
as
he
could
not
trust
the
garrison
beyond
the
walls
of
the
fort
on
account
of
the
discontent
induced
by
the
universal
conviction
of
their
inability
to
oppose
the
english
who
mustered
to
the
number
of
upward
of
three
thousand
exclusive
of
seamen
to
which
force
the
governor
could
not
oppose
more
than
three
hundred
fighting
men
in
the
mean
time
the
garrison
became
disorganized
and
many
desertions
took
place
when
the
governor
yielding
to
necessity
opened
a
communication
with
nicholson
with
the
view
to
capitulation
the
articles
were
in
the
circumstances
highly
favorable
to
the
garrison
they
provided
that
the
soldiers
should
march
out
with
their
arms
and
baggage
drums
beating
and
colors
flying
that
they
should
be
conveyed
to
rochelle
and
that
the
inhabitants
within
three
miles
of
port
royal
should
be
permitted
to
remain
on
their
lands
with
their
corn
cattle
and
furniture
for
two
years
if
so
disposed
on
their
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
queen
of
great
britain
the
destitute
condition
of
the
garrison
was
manifested
by
their
tattered
garments
and
absence
of
provisions
necessary
to
sustain
them
even
for
a
few
days
in
conformity
with
the
terms
of
the
capitulation
four
hundred
eighty
men
in
all
were
transported
to
rochelle
in
france
a
garrison
consisting
of
two
hundred
marines
and
two
hundred
fifty
new
england
volunteers
was
left
in
port
royal
under
colonel
vetch
as
governor
general
nicholson
returning
to
boston
with
the
fleet
the
english
sensible
of
the
disastrous
consequences
resulting
from
the
policy
hitherto
adopted
of
abandoning
port
royal
after
having
taken
repeated
possession
of
it
had
now
resolved
to
retain
it
permanently
the
acadians
were
alarmed
at
the
indications
of
permanent
occupancy
which
they
witnessed
and
evinced
a
degree
of
hostility
which
caused
the
governor
to
adopt
such
measures
as
were
calculated
to
convince
them
that
they
must
act
in
virtue
of
their
temporary
allegiance
to
the
british
crown
as
became
faithful
subjects
the
restraints
imposed
were
galling
to
the
french
and
they
despatched
a
messenger
with
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
canada
referring
to
their
general
misery
under
british
rule
and
praying
to
be
furnished
with
the
means
of
leaving
a
country
where
they
could
not
enjoy
absolute
freedom
but
the
letter
contained
no
specific
charges
in
the
hope
of
regaining
the
fort
and
impressed
with
the
importance
in
the
mean
time
of
intensifying
indian
hostility
to
english
rule
the
canadian
governor
sent
messengers
to
the
french
missionaries
to
exert
their
influence
in
that
direction
the
consequence
was
that
parties
sent
out
to
cut
wood
were
attacked
and
that
travelling
beyond
the
fort
was
rendered
dangerous
eighty
men
sent
from
the
garrison
on
that
service
were
attacked
by
the
indians
who
killed
about
thirty
of
the
party
taking
the
rest
prisoners
vaudreuil
the
governor
of
canada
had
made
preparations
to
assist
in
the
recapture
of
the
fort
but
intelligence
of
a
strong
force
being
in
preparation
to
attack
canada
prevented
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
general
nicholson
on
leaving
port
royal
went
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
government
to
adopt
measures
for
the
thorough
conquest
of
canada
preparations
for
that
end
being
in
progress
in
new
england
his
appeal
was
cordially
responded
to
and
a
fleet
of
twelve
ships
with
storeships
and
transports
and
having
eight
regiments
and
a
train
of
artillery
on
board
the
whole
commanded
by
admiral
walker
left
england
on
april
arriving
in
boston
june
if
his
formidable
force
which
consisted
of
vessels
in
all
having
about
six
thousand
on
board
left
boston
on
july
arriving
at
gaspé
august
where
wood
and

were
taken
in

island
eight
transports
and
eight
hundred
men
at
a
council
of
war
it
was
determined
to
abandon
the
enterprise
and
intelligence
of
the
resolution
was
sent
to
general
nicholson
who
had
left
albany
with
an
army
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
montreal
and
who
consequently
had
the
mortification
of
being
obliged
to
return
immediately
on
september
the
fleet
arrived
at
spanish
bay
and
anchored
in
front
of
lloyd
cove
it
is
questionable
if
the
noble
harbor
of
sydney
has
ever
since
presented
so
lively
a
spectacle
as
on
this
occasion
admiral
walker
was
instructed
if
he
succeeded
in
taking
québec
to
attack
placentia
in
newfoundland
but
at
a
council
of
war
it
was
declared
impracticable
to
make
any
attempt
against
that
place
while
from
the
condition
of
the
stronghold
it
could
have
been
easily
taken
on
his
return
walker
was
the
of
the
nation
literary
squibs
and
pamphlets
were
showered
upon
him
and
his
attempts
at
a
vindication
of
his
conduct
only
rendered
him
the
more
ridiculous
he
stood
in
the
estimation
of
the
nation
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
sir
john
cope
the
commander
of
the
force
sent
to
attack
prince
charles
edward
stuart
on
his
march
from
the
north
of
scotland
in
to
edinburgh
who
after
having
held
a
council
of
war
resolved
to
march
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
the
enemy
was
to
be
found
and
whose
consummate
folly
or
cowardice
in
doing
so
is
a
standing
national
joke
the
severe
contests
in
which
france
and
britain
were
almost
continually
engaged
required
occasional
hence
notwithstanding
the
series
of
brilliant
victories
gained
by
marlborough
the
war
had
become
unpopular
and
the
governmental
policy
had
to
be
assimilated
to
the
national
will
france
was
equally
desirous
of
peace
and
no
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
coming
to
terms
in
the
preparation
of
previous
treaties
france
had
succeeded
in
making
the
cession
to
her
of
any
portion
of
north
american
territory
wrested
from
her
a
fundamental
condition
of
agreement
great
britain
had
hitherto
shown
a
degree
of
pliability
in
yielding
to
the
desire
of
her
great
opponent
in
this
matter
which
seems
unaccountable
and
certainly
incompatible
with
british
interests
but
the
representations
of
the
new
englanders
as
to
the
impolicy
of
such
procedure
were
so
urgent
and
unanswerable
that
the
government
had
resolved
that
the
period
of
vacillation
was
past
and
that
the
exercise
of
firmness
in
the
permanent
retention
of
nova
scotia
was
necessary
hence
in
the
celebrated
treaty
of
utrecht
in
it
was
provided
that
all
nova
scotia
or
acadia
should
be
yielded
and
made
over
to
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
to
her
crown
forever
together
with
newfoundland
france
retaining
possession
of
cape
breton
general
nicholson
having
been
appointed
governor
of
nova
scotia
in
as
well
as
queen
anne
addressed
a
graceful
letter
to
him
dated
june
in
which
after
alluding
to
her
good
brother
the
french
king
having
released
from
imprisonment
on
board
his
galleys
such
of
his
subjects
as
were
detained
there
professing
the
protestant
religion
she
desired
to
show
her
appreciation
of
his
majesty
compliance
with
her
wishes
by
ordering
that
all
frenchmen
in
nova
scotia
and
newfoundland
who
should
desire
to
remain
should
be
permitted
to
retain
their
property
and
enjoy
all
the
privileges
of
british
subjects
and
if
they
chose
to
remove
elsewhere
they
were
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
their
property
by
sale
ere
they
departed
meanwhile
the
acadians
as
well
as
the
inhabitants
of
newfoundland
were
pressed
by
the
french
governor
of
louisburg
de
costabelle
to
remove
to
cape
breton
which
the
great
body
of
the
latter
did
the
acadians
however
could
not
appreciate
the
advantages
to
be
gained
in
removing
from
the
fertile
meadows
of
the
annapolis
valley
to
a
soil
which
however
excellent
required
much
labor
to
render
it
fit
for
cultivation
it
appears
that
they
sent
a
deputation
to
examine
the
island
and
report
as
to
its
adaptability
for
agricultural
purposes
for
one
of
their
missionaries
addressing
de
costabelle
the
governor
says
that
from
the
visits
made
they
were
satisfied
there
were
no
lands
in
cape
breton
suitable
for
the
immediate
maintenance
of
their
families
since
there
were
not
meadows
sufficient
to
nourish
their
cattle
from
which
they
derived
their
principal
support
he
at
the
same
time
represents
the
indians
who
had
been
also
desired
to
remove
as
being
of
opinion
that
living
as
they
did
by
the
chase
the
island
was
quite
insufficient
for
that
purpose
as
well
as
from
its
narrow
limits
equally
unfitted
for
the
exercise
of
their
natural
freedom
but
while
declining
to
leave
nova
scotia
the
acadians
expressed
a
firm
determination
to
continue
loyal
to
the
king
of
france
affirming
that
they
would
never
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
crown
of
england
to
the
prejudice
of
what
they
owed
to
their
king
their
country
and
their
religion
and
intimating
their
resolution
in
the
event
of
any
attempt
to
make
them
swerve
from
their
fidelity
to
france
or
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
their
religion
to
leave
the
country
and
betake
themselves
to
cape

called
the

they
there
