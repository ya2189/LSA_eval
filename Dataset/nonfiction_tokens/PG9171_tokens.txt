preface
the
book
i
give
to
the
public
is
not
made
up
of
isolated
articles
it
is
one
harmonious
demonstration
that
slavery
is
part
of
the
government
ordained
in
certain
conditions
of
fallen
mankind
i
present
the
subject
in
the
form
of
speeches
actually
delivered
and
letters
written
just
as
published
i
adopt
this
method
to
make
a
readable
book
i
give
it
to
the
north
and
south
to
maintain
harmony
among
christians
and
to
secure
the
integrity
of
the
union
of
this
great
people

harmony
and
union
can
be
preserved
only
by
the
view
presented
in
this
volume

of
and
to
continue
for
the
good
of
the
slave

whole
american
family
until
another
and
better
destiny
may
be
unfolded
the
great
which
i
submit
to
north
and
south
is
expressed
in
the
speech
first
in
order
delivered
in
the
general
assembly
of
the
presbyterian
church
buffalo
may
i
therein
say
let
us
then
north
and
south
bring
our
minds
to
comprehend
and
submit
to
their
irresistible
power
let
the
northern
philanthropist
learn
from
the
bible
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
not
sin
let
him
learn
that
god
says
nowhere
it
is
sin
let
him
learn
that
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
law
and
where
there
is
no
law
there
is
no
sin
and
that
golden
may
exist
in
the
relations
of
slavery
let
him
learn
that
slavery
is
simply
an
evil
certain
let
him
learn
that
is
only
the
highest
form
of
social
life
that
to
authority
even
may
in
be
a
better
than
freedom
to
the
slave
of
any
complexion
let
him
learn
that
like
has
its
and
that
the
southern
slave
though
degraded
with
his
master
is
elevated
and
ennobled
compared
with
his
brethren
in
let
the
northern
man
learn
these
things
and
be
wise
to
cultivate
the
spirit
that
will
harmonize
with
his
brethren
of
the
south
who
are
lovers
of
liberty
as
truly
as
himself
and
let
the
southern
christian
nay
the
southern
man
of
every
grade
comprehend
that
never
intended
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
to
be
let
him
give
up
the
theory
of
voltaire
that
the
negro
is
of
a
different
species
let
him
yield
the
of
agassiz
that
god
created
different
races
of
the
same
species
in
swarms
like
bees
for
asia
europe
america
africa
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
let
him
believe
that
slavery
although
not
a
sin
is
a
degraded
condition
the
evil
the
curse
on
the
south
yet
having
blessings
in
its
time
to
the
south
and
to
the
union
let
him
know
that
slavery
is
to
pass
away
in
the
fulness
of
providence
let
the
south
believe
this
and
prepare
to
obey
the
hand
that
moves
their
destiny
all
which
comes
after
in
the
speech
delivered
in
new
york
and
in
the
letters
is
just
the
expansion
of
this
one
controlling
thought
which
must
be
understood
believed
and
acted
out
north
and

before

has
been
for
forty
years
and
more
bearing
testimony
after
a
fashion
against
the
system
of
slavery
that
is
to
say
affirming
in
one
breath
that
is
a
blot
on
our
holy
religion
and
then
in

making
all
sorts
of
apologies
and
justifications
for
the
thus
this
august
body
has
been
in
the
habit
of
telling
the
southern
master
especially
in
the
detroit
resolutions
of
that
he
is
a
hardly
meet
to
be
called
a
but
nevertheless
if
he
will
only
sin
from
unavoidable
necessity
imposed
by

if
he
will
only
sin
under

if

as

he
may

as
usual
the

was
touched
in
a

below
i
made
the
following
remarks
in
ridicule
of
such

and
stultifying

as
an

it
is
always
difficult
to
know
the
temper
of
speaker
and
audience
from
a
printed
report
it
is
due
alike
to
to
the
whole
assembly
and
the
galleries
to
say
that
he
in
reading
these
resolutions
and
throughout
his
speech
evinced
great
and
kindness
of
feeling
which
was
equally
manifested
by
the
assembly
and
spectators
repeatedly
while
he
was
on
the
floor
ross
then
proceeded
moderator
i
move
this
amendment
in
the
best
spirit
i
desire
to
imitate
the
committee
in
their
refinement
and
delicacy
of
distinction
i
disavow
all
intention
to
be
inquisitorial
i
intend
to
be
inquisitorial
as
the
committee
say
they
are
but
not
so
no
sir
not
at
all
not
at
all
laughter
well
sir
we
of
the
south
who
desire
the
removal
of
the
evil
of
slavery
and
believe
it
will
pass
away
in
the
developments
of
providence
are
grieved
when
we
read
your
graphic
shuddering
pictures
of
the
middle
passage
the
piling
up
her
canvas
as
the
shot
pours
after
her
from
english
or
american
guns
see
her
again
and
again
hurrying
hogshead
after
hogshead
filled
with
living
slaves
into
the
deep
and
thus
lightened
escape
sir
what
horror
to
believe
that
was
built
by
the
hands
of
northern
noisy
abolition
yes
i
know
some
in
new
york
and
boston
said
one
in
the
crowd
again
sir
when
we
walk
along
your
and
see
as
we
do
the
soft
hands
of
your
sending
off
to
the
south
not
only
clothing
for
the
slave
but
manacles
and
whips
manufactured
expressly
for
him
what
must
we
think
of
your
consistency
of
character
true
true
and
what
must
we
think
of
your
when
we
know
your
order
the
sale
of
slaves
yes
slaves
such
as
clair
and
under
circumstances
involving
all
the
separations
and
all
the
loathsome
things
you
so
mournfully
deplore
your
stowe
says
so
and
it
is
so
without
her
testimony
i
have
read
that
splendid
bad
book
splendid
in
its
genius
over
which
i
have
wept
and
laughed
and
got
mad
here
some
one
said
all
at
the
same
time
yes
all
at
the
same
time
bad
in
its
theology
bad
in
its
morality
bad
in
its
temporary
evil
influence
here
in
the
north
in
england
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
bad
because
her
isolated
cruelties
will
be
taken
whether
so
meant
by
her
or
not
as
the
general
condition
of
southern
life
while
her
shelbys
and
clairs
and
evas
will
be
looked
upon
as
lingering
for
a
moment
in
that
earthly
hell
the
made
by
the
book
is
a
sir
why
do
your
northern
and
philanthropists
buy
southern
products
at
all
you
know
you
are
purchasing
cotton
rice
sugar
sprinkled
with
blood
literally
you
say
from
the
lash
of
the
driver
why
do
you
buy
what
the
difference
between
my
filching
this
cotton
from
the
outraged
negro
and
your
standing
by
taking
it
from
me
what
the
difference
you
yourselves
say
in
your
abstractions
there
is
no
difference
and
yet
you
daily
stain
your
hands
in
this
horrid
traffic
you
hate
the
traitor
but
you
love
the
treason
your
ladies
too
oh
how
they
shun
the
a
in
but
alas
when
they
see
him
in
the
when
they
see
the
standing
before
them
not
the
brutal
driver
but
the
splendid
gentleman
with
his
unmistakable
grace
of
carriage
and
ease
of
manners
why
lo
behold
the
lady
says
oh
fie
on
your
slavery
what
a
you
are
but
indeed
sir
i
love
your
sugar
and
truly
truly
sir
as
you
are
i
love
you
too
your
gentlemen
talk
just
the
same
way
when
they
behold
our
matchless
women
and
well
for
us
all
it
is
that
your
good
taste
and
hearts
can
thus
appreciate
our
genius
and
accomplishments
and
fascinations
and
loveliness
and
sugar
and
cotton
why
sir
i
heard
this
morning
from
one
pastor
only
of
two
or
three
of
his
members
thus
intermarried
in
the
south
may
i
thus
give
the
mildest
rebuke
to
your
inconsistency
of
conduct
much
excitement
sir
may
we
know
who
are
the
descendants
of
the
new
england
kidnappers
what
is
their
wealth
why
here
you
are
all
around
me
you
gentlemen
made
the
best
of
that
bargain
and
you
have
kept
every
dollar
of
your
money
from
the
charity
of
emancipating
the
slave
you
have
left
us
unaided
to
give
millions
will
you
now
come
to
our
help
will
you
give
dollar
for
dollar
to
equalize
our
loss
here
many
voices
cried
out
yes
yes
we
will
yes
yes
then
pour
out
your
millions
good
i
may
thank
you
personally
my
own
emancipated
slaves
would
be
worth
greatly
more
than
will
you
give
me
back
good
i
need
it
now
i
recommend
to
you
sirs
to
find
out
your
advocates
of
your
owners
of
stock
in
railroads
your
for
money
i
particularly
urge
you
to
find
legree
who
whipped
uncle
tom
to
death
he
is
a
northern
although
having
a
somewhat
southern
name
now
sir
you
know
the
assembly
was
embarrassed
all
yesterday
by
the
inquiry
how
the
northern
churches
may
find
their
absent
members
and
what
to
do
with
them
here
then
sir
is
a
chance
for
you
send
a
committee
up
red
river
you
may
find
legree
to
be
a
garrison
phillips
smith
or
runaway
husband
from
some
abby
kelly
here
rev
smith
protested
against
legree
being
proved
to
be
a
smith
great
laughter
footnote
this
gentleman
was
soon
after
made
a
and
i
think
in
part
for
that
witticism
i
move
that
you
bring
him
back
to
lecture
on
the
there
is
in
leaving
a
northern
church
going
south
changing
his
name
buying
slaves
and
calculating
without
what
the
profit
is
of
killing
a
negro
with
inhuman
labor
above
the
gain
of
treating
him
with
kindness
i
have
little
to
say
of
conventionists
bloomers
cruel
husbands
or
but
if
we
may
believe
your
own
serious
as
well
as
caricature
writers
you
have
things
up
here
of
which
we
down
south
know
very
little
indeed
sir
we
have
no
young
bloomers
with
hat
to
one
side
cigar
in
mouth
and
cane
tapping
the
boot
striding
up
to
a
mincing
young
gentleman
with
long
curls
attenuated
waist
and
soft
velvet
face
the
to
say
may
i
see
you
home
sir
and
the
to
reply
i
thank
ye
no
pa
will
send
the
carriage
sir
we
of
the
south
do
understand
your
conventions
women
have
their
wrongs
the
song
of
the
shirt
charlotte
elizabeth
many
many
laws
tell
her
wrongs
but
your
convention
ladies
despise
the
bible
yes
sir
and
we
of
the
south
are
afraid
and
when
women
despise
the
bible
what
next
then
the
city
of
the
great
salt
lake
then
sodom
and
the
dead
oh
sir
if
slavery
tends
in
any
way
to
give
the
of
to
southern
young
gentlemen
towards
ladies
and
the
exquisite
delicacy
and
heavenly
integrity
and
love
to
southern
maid
and
matron
it
has
then
a
glorious
blessing
with
its
curse
sir
your
inquisitorial
committee
and
the
north
so
far
as
represented
by
them
a
small
fraction
i
know
have
i
take
it
caught
a
tartar
this
time
boys
say
with
us
and
everywhere
i
you
worry
my
dog
and
i
worry
your
cat
sir
it
is
just
simply
a
fact
the
south
will
not
submit
to
these
no
not
for
an
instant
we
will
not
permit
you
to
approach
us
at
all
if
we
are
morbidly
sensitive
you
have
made
us
so
but
you
are
directly
and
grossly
violating
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church
the
book
forbids
you
to
put
such
questions
the
book
forbids
to
begin
the
book

but
ecclesiastically

can
not

in
this
matter
you
have
no
power
to

as
you
propose
i
beg
leave
to
say
just
here
that
tennessee
footnote
at
that
time
i
resided
in
tennessee
will
be
more
calm
under
this
movement
than
any
other
tennessee
has
been
ever
high
above
the
storm
north
and
south
especially
we
of
the
mountains
tennessee
there
she
is
look
at
her
binding
this
union
together
like
a
great
long
broad
deep
stone
more
splendid
than
all
in
the
temple
of
baalbec
or
solomon
tennessee
there
she
is
in
her
calm
valour
i
will
not
lower
her
by
calling
her
unconquerable
for
she
has
never
been
assailed
but
i
call
her
king
mountain
her
pioneer
battles
talladega
emucfau
new

san
jacinto
monterey
the

of

jackson
represented
her
well
in
his
chivalry
from
south
carolina
his
fiery
courage
from
virginia
and
kentucky
all
tempered
by
presbyterian
prudence
from
tennessee
we
in
his
spirit
have
looked
on
this
storm
for
years
untroubled
yes
jackson
old
bones
rattled
in
their
grave
when
that
infamous
disunion
convention
met
in
nashville
and
its
members
turned
pale
and
fled
aghast
yes
tennessee
in
her
mighty
million
feels
secure
and
in
her
perfect
preparation
to
discuss
this
question
politically
ecclesiastically
morally
metaphysically
or
physically
with
the
extreme
north
or
south
she
is
willing
and
able
persuade
others
to
be
in
this
connection
i
wish
to
say
for
the
south
to
the
north
and
to
the
world
that
we
have
no
fears
from
our
there
might
be
a
momentary
insurrection
and
bloodshed
but
destruction
to
the
black
man
would
be
inevitable
the
greeks
and
romans
controlled
immense
masses
of
white
slaves
many
of
them
as
intelligent
as
their
lords
schoolmasters
fabulists
and
poets
were
slaves
athens
with
her
thirty
thousand
freemen
governed
half
a
million
of
bondmen
single
roman
patricians
owned
thirty
thousand
if
then
the
phalanx
and
the
legion
mastered
such
slaves
for
ages
when
battle
was
physical
force
of
man
to
man
how
certain
it
is
that
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
could
hold
in
bondage
millions
of
africans
for
a
thousand
years
but
dear
brethren
our
southern
philanthropists
do
not
seek
to
have
this
unending
bondage
oh
no
no
and
i
earnestly
entreat
you
to
stand
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
assume
a
masterly
inactivity
and
you
will
behold
all
you
desire
and
pray
for
you
will
see
liberated
from
the
curse
of
the
great
question
of
the
world
is
what
is
to
be
the
future
of
the
american
slave
what
is
to
be
the
future
of
the
american
master
the
following
from
the
charleston
mercury
gives
my
view
of
the
subject
with
great
and
condensed
particularity
married
thursday
the
hon
cushing
kewang
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
to
laura
daughter
of
paul
coligny
of
the
united
states
and
one
of
our
noblest
huguenot
families
we
learn
that
this
distinguished
gentleman
with
his
bride
will
visit
his
father
the
emperor
of
china
at
his
summer
palace
in
tartary
north
of
pekin
and
return
to
the
tea
pavilion
on
cooper
river
ere
the
meeting
of
congress
the
editor
of
the
mercury
goes
on
to
say
this
marriage
in
high
life
is
only
one
of
many
which
have
signalized
that
immense
emigration
from
christianized
china
during
the
last
years
whereby
charleston
has
a
population
of
and
the
state
of
south
carolina
over
an
emigration
which
has
wonderfully
harmonized
with
the
great
exodus
of
the
negro
race
to
africa
some
gentleman
here
requested
to
know
of
ross
the
date
of
the
charleston
mercury
recording
this
marriage
the
doctor
replied
the
date
is
may
exactly
one
hundred
years
from
this
day
great
laughter
sir
this
is
a
dream
but
it
is
not
all
a
dream
no
i
verily
believe
you
have
there
the
gordian
knot
of
slavery
untied
you
have
there
the
solution
of
the
problem
you
have
there
the
curtain
up
and
the
last
scene
in
the
last
act
of
the
great
drama
of
ham
i
am
satisfied
with
the
tendencies
of
things
i
stand
on
the
above
the
clouds
i
see
far
beyond
the
storm
the
calm
sea
and
blue
sky
i
see
the
canaan
of
the
african
i
like
to
stand
there
on
the
nebo
of
his
exodus
and
look
across
not
the
jordan
but
the
atlantic
i
see
the
african
crossing
as
certainly
as
if
i
gazed
upon
the
ocean
divided
by
a
great
wind
and
piled
up
in
walls
of
green
glittering
glass
on
either
hand
the
dry
ground
the
marching
host
and
the
pillar
of
cloud
and
of
fire
i
look
over
upon
the
niger
black
with
death
to
the
white
man
instinct
with
life
to
the
children
of
ham
is
the
black
home
oh
how
strange
that
you
of
the
north
see
not
how
you
degrade
him
when
you
keep
him
here
you
will
not
let
him
vote
you
will
not
let
him
rise
to
honors
or
social
equality
you
will
not
let
him
hold
a
pew
in
your
churches
send
him
away
then
tell
him
begone
be
urgent
like
the
egyptians
send
him
out
of
this
land
in
his
fatherland
he
will
exhibit
his
own
type
of
christianity
he
is
of
all
races
the
most
gentle
and
kind
the
the
most
submissive
the
the
most
affectionate
what
other
slaves
would
love
their
masters
better
than
themselves
rock
them
and
fan
them
in
their
cradles
caress
them
how
tenderly
boys
and
girls
honor
them
grown
up
as
superior
beings
and
in
thousands
of
illustrious
instances
be
willing
to
give
life
and
in
fact
die
to
serve
or
save
them
verily
verily
this
emancipated
race
may
reveal
the
most
amiable
form
of
spiritual
life
and
the
may
glitter
on
the
ethiop
brow
in
meaning
more
sublime
than
all
in
the
poet
imagery
brethren
let
them
go
and
when
they
are
gone
ay
before
they
go
away
rear
a
monument
let
it
grow
in
greatness
if
not
on
your
highest
mountain
in
your
hearts
in
lasting
memory
of
the
south
in
memory
of
your
wrong
to
the
south
in
memory
of
the
of
the
south
and
her
philanthropy
in
training
the
slave
to
be
free
enlightened
and
christian
can
all
this
be
can
this
double
emigration
civilize
africa
and
more
than
the
south
yes
and
i
regard
the
difficulties
presented
here
in
congress
or
the
country
as
little
worth
god
intends
both
emigrations
and
without
miracle
he
will
accomplish
both
difficulties
there
are
no
difficulties
half
a
million
emigrate
to
our
shores
from
ireland
and
all
europe
every
year
and
you
gravely
talk
of
difficulties
in
the
way
to
africa
verily
god
will
unfold
their
destiny
as
fast
and
as
fully
as
he
sees
best
for
the
highest
good
of
the
slave
the
highest
good
of
the
master
and
the
glory
of
christ
in
africa
and
sir
there
are
forty
thousand
chinese
in
california
and
in
cuba
this
day
american
gentlemen
are
cultivating
sugar
with
chinese
hired
labor
more
profitably
than
the
spaniards
and
their
slaves
oh
there
is
china
half
the
population
of
the
globe
just
fronting
us
across
that
peaceful
sea
her
poor
living
on
rats
and
a
pittance
of
red
rice
her
rich
hoarding
millions
in
senseless
idolatry
or
indulging
in
the
luxuries
of
and
roasted
ice
massed
together
they
must
migrate
where
can
they
go
they
must
come
to
our
shores
they
must
come
even
did
god
forbid
them
but
he
will
hasten
their
coming
they
can
live
in
the
extremest
south
it
is
their
latitude
their
side
of
the
ocean
they
can
cultivate
cotton
rice
sugar
tea
and
the
silkworm
their
skill
their
manipulation
is
unrivalled
their
commonest
gong
you
can
neither
make
nor
explain
they
are
a
people
without
castes
accustomed
to
rise
by
merit
to
highest
distinctions
and
capable
of
the
noblest
training
when
their
idolatry
which
is
waxing
old
as
a
garment
shall
be
folded
up
as
a
vesture
and
changed
for
whose
years
shall
not
fail
the
english
ambassador
assures
us
that
the
chinese
negotiator
of
the
late
treaty
was
a
splendid
gentleman
and
a
diplomatist
to
move
in
any
court
of
europe
shem
then
can
mingle
with
japheth
in
america
the
chinese
must
come
god
will
bring
them
he
will
fulfil
benton
noble
thought
the
railroad
must
complete
the
voyage
of
columbus
the
statue
of
the
genoese
on
some
peak
of
the
rocky
mountains
high
above
the
flying
cars
must
point
to
the
west
saying
there
is
the
east
there
is
india
and
cathay
let
us
then
north
and
south
bring
our
minds
to
comprehend
and
submit
to
their
irresistible
power
let
the
northern
philanthropist
learn
from
the
bible
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
not
sin
let
him
learn
that
god
nowhere
says
it
is
sin
let
him
learn
that
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
law
and
where
there
is
no
law
there
is
no
sin
and
that
golden
may
exist
in
the
relations
of
slavery
let
him
learn
that
slavery
is
simply
an
evil
certain
let
him
learn
that
is
only
the
highest
form
of
social
life
that
to
authority
even
may
in
be
a
better
than
freedom
to
the
slave
of
any
complexion
let
him
learn
that
like
has
its
and
that
the
southern
slave
though
degraded
with
his
is
and
compared
with
his
brethren
in
let
the
northern
man
learn
these
things
and
be
wise
to
cultivate
the
spirit
that
will
harmonize
with
his
brethren
of
the
south
who
are
lovers
of
liberty
as
truly
as
himself
and
let
the
southern
christian
nay
the
southern
man
of
every
grade
comprehend
that
never
intended
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
to
be
let
him
give
up
the
theory
of
voltaire
that
the
negro
is
of
a
different
species
let
him
yield
the
of
agassiz
that
god
created
different
races
of
the
same
species
in
swarms
like
bees
for
asia
europe
america
africa
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
let
him
believe
that
slavery
although
not
a
sin
is
a
degraded
condition
the
evil
the
curse
on
the
south
yet
having
blessings
in
its
time
to
the
south
and
to
the
union
let
him
know
that
slavery
is
to
pass
away
in
the
fulness
of
providence
let
the
south
believe
this
and
prepare
to
obey
the
hand
that
moves
their
destiny
ham
will
be
ever
lower
than
shem
shem
will
be
ever
lower
than
japheth
all
will
rise
in
the
christian
grandeur
to
be
revealed
ham
will
be
lower
than
shem
because
he
was
sent
to
central
africa
man
south
of
the
equator
in
asia
australia
oceanica
america
especially
africa
is
inferior
to
his
northern

his
magnificent

the

upon
japheth
in
his
europe
will
be
combined
in
america
of
the
in
commingled
light
and
life
i
see
it
all
in
the
first
symbolical
altar
of
noah
on
that
mound
at
the
base
of
ararat
the
father
of
all
living
men
bows
before
the
incense
of
sacrifice
streaming
up
and
mingling
with
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
his
noble
family
and
all
flesh
saved
are
grouped
round
about
him
there
is
ham
at
the
foot
of
the
green
hillock
standing
in
his
antediluvian
rakish
recklessness
near
the
giraffe
type
of
his
his
magnificent
wife
seated
on
the
grass
her
little
feet
nestling
in
the
tame
lion
mane
her
long
black
hair
flowing
over
crimson
drapery
and
covered
with
gems
from
mines
before
the
flood
higher
up
is
shem
leaning
his
arm
over
that
horse
his
steed
his
wife
in
pure
white
linen
feeds
the
elephant
and
plays
with
his
lithe
proboscis
the
mother
of
terah
abraham
isaac
jacob
joseph
david
and
christ
and
yet
she
looks
up
and
bows
in
mild
humility
to
of
japheth
seated
amid
plumed
birds
in
robes
like
the
sky
her
noble
lord
meanwhile
high
above
all
stands
with
folded
arms
following
that
eagle
which
wheels
up
towards
ararat
displaying
his
breast
glittering
with
stars
and
stripes
of
scarlet
and
silver
radiant
heraldry
traced
by
the
hand
of
god
now
he
purifies
his
eye
in
the
sun
and
now
he
spreads
his
broad
wings
in
symbolic
flight
to
the
until
lost
to
the
prophetic
eye
of
japheth
under
the
bow
of

oh
may
the
bow
of

be
here
that
the
waters
of

never

threaten
our
beloved
land
speech
delivered
in
the
general
assembly
new
york
the
circumstances
under
which
this
speech
was
delivered
are
sufficiently
shown
in
the
statement
below
it
was
not
a
hasty
production
after
being
spoken
it
was
prepared
for
the
journal
of
commerce
with
the
greatest
care
i
could
give
to
it
most
of
it
was
written
again
and
again
unlike
pascal
who
said
as
to
his
longest
and
inferior
sixteenth
letter
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
make
it
shorter
i
had
time
and
i
did
condense
in
that
one
speech
the
matured
reflections
of
my
whole
life
i
am
calmly
satisfied
i
am
right
i
am
sure
god
has
said
and
does
say
well
done
the
speech
brings
to
view
a
wide
range
of
thought
all
belonging
to
the
subject
of
slavery
of
immense
importance
as
introductory
there
is
the
question
of
the
abolition
agitation
the
last
thirty
years
then
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
the
foundation
of
moral
obligation
then
the
definition
of
sin
next
the
origin
of
human
government
and
the
relations
in
which
god
has
placed
men
under
his
rule
of
subjection
finally
the
word
of
god
is
brought
to
sustain
all
the
positions
taken
the
challenge
to
argue
the
question
of
slavery
from
the
bible
was
thrown
down
on
the
floor
of
the
assembly
as
stated
presently
i
took
up
the
gauntlet
and
made
this
argument
the
challenger
never
claimed
his
glove
then
nor
since
nor
has
anybody
so
far
as
i
know
attempted
to
refute
this
speech
nothing
has
come
to
my
ears
save
as
to
two
points
to
be
noticed
hereafter
but
reckless
bold
denial
of
god
truth
infidel
affirmation
without
attempt
at
proof
and
denunciations
of
myself
having
said
that
he
would
argue
the
question
on
the
bible
at
a
following
time
ross
rose
when
he
took
his
seat
and
taking
his
position
on
the
platform
near
the
moderator
chair
said
i
accept
the
challenge
given
by
wisner
to
argue
the
question
of
slavery
from
the
scriptures
does
the
brother
propose
to
go
into
it
here
yes
sir
well
i
did
not
propose
to
go
into
it
here
you
gave
the
challenge
and
i
accept
it
i
said
i
would
argue
it
at
a
proper
time
but
it
is
no
matter
go
ahead
hoped
the
discussion
would
be
ruled
out
he
did
not
think
it
a
legitimate
subject
to
go
into
moses
and
the
prophets
christ
and
his
apostles
and
all
intermediate
authorities
on
the
subject
of
what
the
general
assembly
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
america
had
done
considered
the
question
had
been
opened
by
this
report
of
the
majority
after
which
withdrew
his
objection
and
proceeded
i
am
not
a
nay
i
have
shown
some
in
that
matter
i
emancipated
slaves
whose
would
now
be
in
the
providence
of
god
my
riches
have
entirely
passed
from
me
i
do
not
mean
that
like
the
widow
i
gave
all
the
living
i
had
my
estate
was
then
greater
than
that
i
merely
wish
to
show
i
have
no
selfish
motive
in
giving
as
i
shall
the
true
southern
defence
of
slavery
applause
i
speak
from
huntsville
alabama
my
present
home
that
gem
of
the
south
that
beautiful
city
where
the
mountain
softens
into
the
vale
where
the
water
gushes
a
great
fountain
from
the
rock
where
around
that
living
stream
there
are
streets
of
roses
and
houses
of
intelligence
and
gracefulness
and
gentlest
hospitality
and
withal
where
so
high
honor
is
ever
given
to
the
ministers
of
god
speaking
then
from
that
region
where
is
i
affirm
contrary
as
my
opinion
is
to
that
most
common
in
the
south
that
the
slavery
agitation
has
accomplished
and
will
do
great
good
i
said
so
to
ministerial
and
political
friends
years
ago
i
have
always
favored
the
agitation
just
as
i
have
always
countenanced
discussion
upon
all
subjects
i
felt
that
the
slavery
question
needed
examination
i
believed
it
was
not
understood
in
its
relations
to
the
bible
and
human
liberty
sir
the
light
is
spreading
north
and
south
is
said
i
know
this
agitation
has
increased
the
severity
of
slavery
true
but
for
a
moment
only
in
the
days
of
the
years
of
the
life
of
this
noble
problem
farmers
tell
us
that
deep
ploughing
in
poor
ground
will
for
a
year
or
two
give
you
a
worse
crop
than
before
you
went
so
deep
but
that
that
deep
ploughing
will
turn
up
the
and
sun
and
air
and
rain
will
give
you
harvests
increasingly
rich
so
this
moral
soil
north
and
south
was
unproductive
it
needed
deep
ploughing
for
a
time
the
harvest
was
worse
now
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
abundant
the
political
controversy
however
fierce
and
threatening
is
only
for
power
but
the
moral
agitation
is
for
the
harmony
of
the
northern
and
southern
mind
in
the
right
interpretations
of
scripture
on
this
great
subject
and
of
course
for
the
ultimate
union
of
the
hearts
of
all
sensible
people
to
fulfil
god
intention
to
bless
the
white
man
and
the
black
man
in
america
i
am
sure
of
this
i
take
a
wide
view
of
the
progress
of
the
destiny
of
this
vast
empire
i
see
god
in
america
i
see
him
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
i
see
him
more
honored
in
the
south
than
he
was
years
ago
and
that
that
higher
regard
is
due
mainly
to
the
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
do
you
ask
how
why
sir
this
is
the
how
years
ago
the
religious
mind
of
the
south
was
leavened
by
wrong
northern
training
on
the
great
point
of
the
right
and
wrong
of
slavery
meanwhile
powerful
intellects
in
the
south
following
the
mere
light
of
a
healthy
good
sense
guided
by
the
common
grace
of
god
reached
the
very
truth
of
this
great
matter
namely
that
the
relation
of
the
master
and
slave
is
not
sin
and
that
notwithstanding
its
admitted
evils
it
is
a
connection
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
races
of
man
revealing
influences
which
may
be
and
will
be
most
benevolent
for
the
ultimate
good
of
the
master
and
the
slave
conservative
on
the
union
by
preserving
the
south
from
all
forms
of
northern
fanaticism
and
thereby
being
a
great
in
the
working
of
the
tremendous
machinery
of
our
experiment
of
this
seen
result
of
slavery
was
found
to
be
in
absolute
harmony
with
the
word
of
god
these
men
then
of
highest
grade
of
thought
who
had
turned
in
scorn
from
northern
notions
now
see
in
the
bible
that
these
notions
are
false
and
silly
they
now
read
the
bible
never
examined
before
with
growing
respect
god
is
honored
and
his
glory
will
be
more
and
more
in
their
salvation
these
are
some
of
the
moral
consummations
of
this
agitation
in
the
south
the
development
has
been
twofold
in
the
north
on
the
one
hand
some
men
have
left
the
light
of
the
bible
and
wandered
into
the
darkness
until
they
have
reached
the
blackness
of
the
darkness
of
infidelity
other
some
are
following
hard
after
and
are
throwing
the
bible
into
the
furnace
are
melting
it
into
iron
and
forging
it
and
welding
it
and
twisting
it
and
grooving
it
into
the
shape
and
significance
and
goodness
and
gospel
of
sharpe
rifles
sir
are
you
not
afraid
that
some
of
your
once
best
men
will
soon
have
no
better
bible
than
that
but
on
the
other
hand
many
of
your
brightest
minds
are
looking
intensely
at
the
subject
in
the
same
light
in
which
it
is
studied
by
the
highest
southern
reason
ay
sir
old
fogy
as
she
is
begins
to
open
her
eyes
what
then
is
our
gain
sir
uncle
tom
cabin
in
many
of
its
conceptions
could
not
have
been
written
years
ago
that
book
of
genius
over
which
i
and
hundreds
in
the
world
have
freely
wept
true
in
all
its
facts
false
in
all
its
impressions
yea
as
false
in
the
prejudice
it
creates
to
southern
social
life
as
if
webster
the
murderer
of
parkman
may
be
believed
to
be
a
personification
of
the
of
honor
in
cambridge
boston
and
new
england
nevertheless
uncle
tom
cabin
could
not
have
been
written
years
ago
nehemiah
adams
could
not
have
been
written
years
ago
nor
nathan
lord
of
nor
miss
murray
book
nor
is
nor
bledsoe
and
slavery
these
books
written
in
the
midst
of
this
agitation
are
all
of
high
some
the
highest
reach
of
talent
and
noblest
piety
all
give
with
increasing
confidence
the
present
southern
bible
reading
on
slavery
may
the
agitation
then
go
on
i
know
the
new
school
presbyterian
church
has
sustained
some
temporary
injury
but
god
is
honored
in
his
word
the
reaction
when
the
first
commenced
has
been
succeeded
by
the
sober
second
thought
of
the
south
the
sun
stayed
is
again
travelling
in
the
greatness
of
his
strength
and
will
shine
brighter
and
brighter
to
the
perfect
day
my
only
fear
moderator
is
that
as
you
northern
people
are
so
prone
to
go
to
extremes
in
your
zeal
and
run
every
thing
into
the
ground
you
may
perhaps
become
and
that
we
may
have
to
take
measures
against
your
coveting
over
much
our
daughters
if
not
our
wives
our
our
our
houses
and
our
lands
laughter
sir
i
come
now
to
the
bible
argument
i
begin
at
the
beginning
of
eternity
laughter
what
is
right
and
wrong
the
question
of
two
theories
have
obtained
in
the
world
the
one
is
that
right
and
wrong
are
eternal
facts
that
they
exist
in
the
nature
of
things
that
they
are
ultimate
truths
above
god
that
he
must
study
and
does
study
to
know
them
as
really
as
man
and
that
he
comprehends
them
more
clearly
than
man
only
because
he
is
a
better
student
than
man
now
sir
theory
is
for
if
right
and
wrong
are
like
mathematical
truths
fixed
facts
then
i
may
find
them
out
as
i
find
out
mathematical
truths
without
instruction
from
god
i
do
not
ask
god
to
tell
me
that
one
and
one
make
two
i
do
not
ask
him
to
reveal
to
me
the
demonstrations
of
euclid
i
thank
him
for
the
mind
to
perceive
but
i
perceive
mathematical
relations
without
his
telling
me
because
they
exist
independent
of
his
will
if
then
moral
truths
if
right
and
wrong
if
rectitude
and
sin
are
in
like
manner
fixed
eternal
facts
if
they
are
out
from
and
above
god
like
mathematical
entities
then
i
may
find
them
for
myself
i
may
condescend
perhaps
to
regard
the
bible
as
a
hornbook
in
which
god
an
older
student
than
i
tells
how
to
to
learn
what
he
had
to
study
or
i
may
decline
to
be
taught
through
the
bible
how
to
learn
right
and
wrong
i
may
think
the
bible
was
good
enough
may
be
for
the
israelite
in
egypt
and
in
canaan
good
enough
for
the
christian
in
jerusalem
and
antioch
and
rome
but
not
good
enough
even
as
a
hornbook
for
me
the
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
man
of
boston
new
york
and
brooklyn
oh
no
i
may
think
i
need
it
not
at
all
what
next
why
sir
if
i
may
think
i
need
not
god
to
teach
me
moral
truth
i
may
think
i
need
him
not
to
teach
me
any
thing
what
next
the
irresistible
conclusion
is
i
may
think
i
can
live
without
god
that
jehovah
is
a
myth
a
name
i
may
bid
him
stand
aside
or
die
oh
sir
will
the
fool
to
say
there
is
no
god
this
is
the
result
of
the
notion
that
right
and
wrong
exist
in
the
nature
of
things
the
other
theory
is
that
right
and
wrong
are
results
brought
into
being
mere
contingencies
means
to
good
made
to
exist
solely
by
the
will
of
god
expressed
through
his
word
or
when
his
will
is
not
thus
known
he
shows
it
in
the
human
reason
by
which
he
rules
the
natural
heart
this
is
so
because
god
in
making
all
things
saw
that
in
the
relations
he
would
constitute
between
himself
and
intelligent
creatures
and
among
themselves
natural
good
and
evil
would
come
to
pass
in
his
benevolent
wisdom
he
then
law
to
control
this
good
and
and
he
thereby
made
to
that
law
to
be
and
to
be
why
simply
because
he
saw
it
to
be
good
and
made
it
to
be
right
not
because
saw
it
to
be
but
because
he
it
to
be
hence
the
ten
specific
commandments
of
the
one
moral
law
of
love
are
just
ten
rules
which
god
made
to
regulate
the
natural
good
and
evil
which
he
knew
would
be
in
the
ten
relations
which
he
himself
constituted
between
himself
and
man
and
between
man
and
his
neighbor
the
bible
settles
the
question
is
the
transgression
of
the
law
and
where
there
is
no
law
there
is
no
i
one
step
further
is
as
a
mental
state
is
it
some
quality
some
concentrated
essence
some
elementary
moral
particle
in
the
nature
of
things
something
black
or
red
like
crimson
in
the
constitution
of
the
soul
or
the
soul
and
body
as
amalgamated
no
is
it
no
is
it
selfishness
no
what
is
it
just
exactly
just
that
i
the
creature
will
to
will
god
the
creator
it
is
the
i
am
who
dares
to
defy
and
dishonor
the
i
am
not
created
the
lord
god
the
almighty
holy
eternal
is
sin
and
that
is
all
of
it
so
help
me
god
your
child
there
john
says
to
his
father
i
will
to
to
your
will
why
not
john
and
he
answers
and
says
because
i
will
there
sir
john
has
revealed
of
on
earth
or
in
hell
satan
has
never
said
can
never
say
more
i
satan
will
not
because
i
will
to
to
thee
god
my
will
not
thine
shall
be
this
beautiful
theory
is
the
ray
of
light
which
leads
us
from
night
and
twilight
and
fog
and
mist
and
mystification
on
this
subject
to
clear
day
i
will
illustrate
it
by
the
law
which
has
controlled
and
now
regulates
the
most
delicate
of
all
the
relations
of
life
viz
that
of
the
intercourse
between
the
sexes
i
take
this
because
it
presents
the
strongest
apparent
objections
to
my
argument
cain
and
abel
married
their
sisters
was
it
wrong
in
the
nature
of
things
here
wisner
spoke
out
and
said
certainly
i
deny
it
what
an
absurdity
to
suppose
that
god
could
not
provide
for
the
propagation
of
the
human
race
from
one
pair
without
them
to
sin
adam
sons
and
daughters
must
have
married
had
they
remained
in
innocence
they
must
then
have
sinned
in
eden
from
the
very
necessity
of
the
command
upon
the
race
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
i
what
pure
nonsense
there
sir
my
one
question
reply
and
my
rejoinder
bring
out
perfectly
the
two
theories
of
right
and
wrong
sir
abraham
married
his
and
there
is
not
a
word
forbidding
such
marriage
until
god
gave
the
law
lev
xviii
prohibiting
marriage
in
certain
degrees
of
consanguinity
that
law
made
then
such
marriage
but
god
gave
no
such
law
in
the
family
of
adam
because
he
made
himself
the
marriage
of
brother
and
sister
the
way
and
the
only
way
for
the
increase
of
the
human
race
commanded
them
thus
to
marry
they
would
have
sinned
had
they
not
thus
for
they
would
have
transgressed
his
law
such
marriage
was
not
even
a
natural
evil
in
the
then
family
of
man
but
when
in
the
increase
of
numbers
it
became
a
natural
evil
physical
and
social
god
placed
man
on
a
higher
platform
for
the
development
of
civilization
morals
and
religion
and
then
made
the
law
regulating
marriages
in
the
particulars
of
blood
but
he
still
left
polygamy
untouched
here
wisner
again
asked
if
regarded
the
bible
as
sustaining
the
polygamy
of
the
old
testament
yes
sir
yes
sir
yes
sir
let
the
reporters
mark
question
and
my
answer
laughter
my
principle
vindicates
god
from
unintelligible
abstractions
i
fearlessly
tell
what
the
bible
says
in
its
strength
i
am
not
afraid
of
earth
or
hell
i
fear
only
god
god
made
no
law
against
polygamy
in
the
beginning
therefore
it
was
no
sin
for
a
man
to
have
more
wives
than
one
god
sanctioned
it
and
made
laws
in
regard
to
it
abraham
had
more
wives
than
one
jacob
had
david
had
solomon
had
god
told
david
by
the
mouth
of
nathan
when
he
upbraided
him
with
his
ingratitude
for
the
blessings
he
had
given
him
and
said
and
i
gave
thee
thy
master
house
and
master
into
thy
bosom
sam
xvii
god
in
the
gospel
places
man
on
another
platform
for
the
revelation
of
a
nobler
social
and
spiritual
life
he
now
forbids
polygamy
now
is
not
because
it
is
in
itself
sin
no
but
because
god
forbids
it
to
restrain
the
natural
and
social
evil
and
to
bring
out
a
higher
humanity
and
see
sir
how
gently
in
the
gospel
the
transition
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
of
our
progress
upward
is
made
christ
and
his
apostles
do
not
declare
polygamy
to
be
sin
the
new
law
is
so
wisely
given
that
nothing
existing
is
rudely
disturbed
the
minister
of
god
unmarried
must
have
only
one
wife
at
the
same
time
this
law
silently
and
gradually
by
inevitable
and
fair
inference
of
its
meaning
and
from
the
example
of
the
apostles
passed
over
the
christian
world
god
in
the
gospel
places
us
in
this
higher
and
holier
ground
and
air
of
love
we
sin
then
if
we
marry
the
sister
and
other
near
of
kin
and
we
sin
if
we
marry
at
the
same
time
more
wives
than
one
not
because
there
is
sin
in
the
thing
itself
whatever
of
natural
evil
there
might
be
but
because
in
so
doing
we
transgress
god
law
given
to
secure
and
advance
the
good
of
man
i
might
comment
in
the
same
way
on
every
one
of
the
ten
commandments
but
i
pass
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
this
view
of
and
is
seen
in
the
very
light
of
heaven
and
you
moderator
know
that
if
the
view
i
have
presented
be
true
i
have
got
you
great
laughter
the
moderator
said
very
pleasantly
yes
but
it
is
a
continued
laughter
touched
the
moderator
on
the
shoulder
and
said
yes
it
is
a
for
it
is
this
there
is
a
god
he
is
not
jupiter
bowing
to
the
fates
but
god
the
sovereign
over
the
universe
he
has
created
in
which
he
makes
right
by
making
law
to
be
known
and
obeyed
by
angels
and
men
in
their
varied
conditions
he
gave
adam
command
sublime
in
its
simplicity
and
intended
to
vindicate
the
principle
i
am
affirming
that
there
is
no
right
and
wrong
in
the
nature
of
things
there
was
no
right
or
wrong
in
eating
or
willing
to
eat
of
that
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
but
god
made
the
law
shall
not
eat
of
that
as
if
he
had
said
i
seek
to
the
submission
of
your
will
freely
to
my
will
and
that
your
test
may
be
perfect
i
will
let
your
temptation
be
nothing
more
than
your
natural
desire
for
that
fruit
adam
sinned
what
was
the
sin
adam
said
in
heart
my
will
shall
be
was
the
sin
simple
transgression
of
god
when
there
was
neither
sin
nor
evil
in
the
which
god
forbade
to
be
done
man
fell
and
was
cursed
the
law
of
the
control
of
the
superior
over
the
inferior
is
now
to
begin
and
is
to
go
on
in
the
depraved
conditions
of
the
fallen
and
cursed
race
and
first
god
said
to
the
woman
desire
shall
be
to
thy
husband
and
he
shall
rule
over
thee
there
in
that
law
is
beginning
of
government
ordained
of
god
is
the
beginning
of
the
rule
of
the
superior
over
the
inferior
bound
to
obey
in
the
family
of
adam
is
the
germ
of
the
rule
in
the
tribe
the
state
adam
in
his
right
from
god
to
rule
over
his
wife
and
his
children
had
the
afterwards
expanded
in
the
patriarch
and
the
king
this
simple
beautiful
fact
there
on
the
first
leaf
of
the
bible
solves
the
problem
whence
and
how
has
man
right
to
rule
over
man
in
that
great
fact
god
gives
his
denial
to
the
idea
that
government
over
man
is
the
result
of
a
social
compact
in
which
each
individual
man
living
in
a
state
of
natural
liberty
yielded
some
of
that
liberty
to
secure
the
greater
good
of
government
such
a
thing
never
was
such
a
thing
never
could
have
been
was
ordained
and
established
before
the
first
child
was
born
he
shall
rule
over
thee
cain
and
abel
were
born
in
a
as
perfect
as
the
empire
of
britain
or
the
rule
of
these
united
states
all
that
blackstone
and
paley
and
hobbs
or
anybody
else
says
about
the
social
compact
is
flatly
and
fully
denied
and
upset
by
the
bible
history
and
common
sense
let
any
new
york
lawyer
or
even
a
philadelphia
lawyer
deny
this
if
he
dares
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
never
were
the
right
of
the
man
his
in
all
these
particulars
the
was
subordinate
to
the
good
of
the
family
the
empire
the
command
to
noah
was
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
ix
this
command
to
shed
blood
was
and
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
law
thou
shalt
not
kill
there
is
nothing
right
or
wrong
in
taking
of
per
se
or
in
itself
considered
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
a
natural
good
or
evil
as
a
the
taking
of
life
is
a
natural
evil
hence
thou
shalt
not
kill
is
the
general
rule
to
preserve
the
good
there
is
in
life
to
take
life
under
the
forbidden
conditions
is
sin
simply
because
god
forbids
it
under
those
conditions
the
sin
is
not
in
taking
life
but
in
transgressing
god
law
but
the
taking
of
life
will
secure
a
greater
good
god
then
commands
that
life
be
taken
not
to
take
life
under
the
commanded
conditions
is
sin
solely
because
god
then
commands
it
this
power
over
life
for
the
good
of
the
one
great
family
of
man
god
to
noah
and
through
him
to
the
tribe
the
clan
the
kingdom
the
empire
the
democracy
the
republic
as
they
may
be
governed
by
chief
king
emperor
parliament
or
congress
had
ham
killed
shem
noah
would
have
commanded
japheth
to
slay
him
so
much
for
the
origin
of
the
power
over
life
now
for
the
power
over
liberty
the
right
to
take
life
included
the
right
over
liberty
but
god
intended
the
rule
of
the
superior
over
the
inferior
in
relations
of
service
should
human
depravity
his
curse
and
his
overruling
the
rule
and
the
subordination
which
is
essential
to
the
existence
of
the
family
god
made
commensurate
with
mankind
for
is
only
the
congeries
of
when
ham
in
his
antediluvian
recklessness
laughed
at
his
father
god
took
occasion
to
give
to
the
world
the
rule
of
the
superior
over
the
inferior
cursed
him
he
cursed
him
because
he
left
him
the
withholding
of
the
father
blessing
in
the
bible
was
curse
hence
abraham
prayed
god
when
isaac
was
blessed
that
ishmael
might
not
be
passed
by
hence
esau
prayed
his
father
when
jacob
was
blessed
that
he
might
not
be
left
untouched
by
his
holy
hands
ham
was
cursed
to
render
service
forever
to
shem
and
japheth
the
curse
on
canaan
made
the
general
curse
on
ham
conspicuous
historic
and
explanatory
simply
because
his
descendants
were
to
be
brought
under
the
control
of
god
peculiar
people
shem
was
blessed
to
rule
over
ham
japheth
was
blessed
to

moderator
you
have
read
guyot
and
that
admirable
book
is
a
commentary
upon
this
part
of
genesis
it
is
the
philosophy
of
geography
and
it
is
the
philosophy
of
the
rule
of
the
higher
races
over
the
inferior
written
on
the
very
face
of
the
earth
he
tells
you
why
the
continents
are
shaped
as
they
are
shaped
why
the
mountains
stand
where
they
stand
why
the
rivers
run
where
they
run
why
the
currents
of
the
sea
and
the
air
flow
as
they
flow
and
he
tells
you
that
the
earth
south
of
the
equator
makes
the
inferior
man
that
the
oceanic
climate
makes
the
inferior
man
in
the
pacific
islands
that
south
america
makes
the
inferior
man
that
the
solid
unindented
southern
africa
makes
the
inferior
man
that
the
huge
heavy
massive
magnificent
asia
makes
the
huge
heavy
massive
magnificent
man
that
europe
indented
by
the
sea
on
every
side
with
its
varied
scenery
and
climate
and
northern
influences
makes
the
varied
intellect
the
versatile
power
and
life
and
action
of
the
of
the
world
and
it
is
so
africa
with
here
and
there
an
exception
has
never
produced
men
to
compare
with
the
men
of
asia
for
six
thousand
years
save
the
unintelligible
stones
of
egypt
she
has
had
no
history
asia
has
had
her
great
men
and
her
name
but
europe
has
ever
shown
and
now
her
nobler
men
and
higher
destiny
japheth
has
now
come
to
north
america
to
give
us
his
past
greatness
and
his
transcendent
glory
applause
and
sir
i
thank
god
our
mountains
stand
where
they
stand
and
that
our
rivers
run
where
they
run
thank
god
they
run
not
across
longitudes
but
across
latitudes
from
north
to
south
if
they
crossed
longitudes
we
might
fear
for
the
union
but
i
hail
the
union
made
by
god
strong
as
the
strength
of
our
hills
and
ever
to
live
and
expand
like
the
flow
and
swell
of
the
current
of
our
streams
applause
these
two
theories
of
right
and
wrong
these
two
ideas
of
human
liberty
the
right
in
the
nature
of
things
or
the
right
as
made
by
god
the
liberty
of
the
individual
man
of
atheism
of
red
republicanism
of
the
devil
or
the
liberty
of
man
in
the
family
in
the
state
the
liberty
from
god
these
two
theories
now
make
the
conflict
of
the
world
this
battle
is
only
part
of
the
great
struggle
god
will
be
victorious
and
we
in
his
might
i
now
come
to
particular
illustrations
of
the
law
that
service
shall
be
rendered
by
the
inferior
to
the
superior
the
relations
in
which
such
service
obtains
are
very
many
some
of
them
are
these
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
teacher
and
scholar
commander
and
soldier
sailor
master
and
apprentice
master
and
hireling
master
and
slave
now
sir
all
these
relations
are
ordained
of
god
they
are
all
directly
commanded
or
they
are
the
irresistible
law
of
his
providence
in
conditions
which
must
come
up
in
the
progress
of
depraved
nature
the
relations
themselves
are
all
good
in
certain
conditions
and
there
may
be
no
more
of
evil
in
the
lowest
than
in
the
highest
and
there
may
be
in
the
lowest
as
really
as
in
the
highest
the
fulfilment
of
the
commandment
to
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
and
of
doing
unto
him
whatsoever
thou
wouldst
have
him
to
do
unto
thee
why
sir
the
wife
everywhere
except
where
christianity
has
given
her
elevation
is
and
sir
i
say
without
fear
of
saying
too
strongly
that
for
every
sigh
every
groan
every
tear
every
agony
of
stripe
or
death
which
has
gone
up
to
god
from
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
there
have
been
more
sighs
more
groans
more
tears
and
more
agony
in
the
rule
of
the
husband
over
the
wife
sir
i
have
admitted
and
do
again
admit
without
qualification
that
every
fact
in
uncle
tom
cabin
has
occurred
in
the
south
but
in
reply
i
say
deliberately
what
one
of
your
first
men
told
me
that
he
who
will
make
the
horrid
examination
will
discover
in
new
york
city
in
any
number
of
years
past
more
cruelty
from
husband
to
wife
parent
to
child
in
all
the
south
from
master
to
in
the
same
time
i
dare
the
investigation
and
you
may
extend
it
further
if
you
choose
to
all
the
results
of
honor
and
purity
i
fear
nothing
on
this
subject
i
stand
on
rock
the
bible
and
therefore
just
before
i
bring
the
bible
to
which
all
i
have
said
is
introductory
i
will
run
a
parallel
between
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
and
that
of
husband
and
wife
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
grinding
oppression
of
capital
upon
labor
in
the
power
of
the
master
over
the
hireling
the
crushed
peasant
the
woman
a
thousand
feet
under
ground
working
in
darkness
her
child
toiling
by
her
side
and
another
child
not
born
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
which
fills
the
navy
of
britain
the
conscription
which
makes
the
army
of
france
the
terrible
floggings
the
awful
the
quick
sentence
the
the
chain
and
ball
and
lash
the
punishment
of
the
soldier
sailor
slave
who
had
run
away
i
pass
all
this
by
i
will
run
the
parallel
between
the
slave
and
wife
do
you
say
the
slave
is
held
to
service
so
is
the
wife
her
relation
to
her
husband
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
is
made
for
her
and
not
by
her
and
when
she
makes
it
for
herself
how
often
and
how
soon
does
it
become
involuntary
how
often
and
how
soon
would
she
throw
off
the
yoke
if
she
could
o
ye
wives
i
know
how
superior
you
are
to
your
husbands
in
many
respects
not
only
in
personal
attraction
although
in
that
particular
comparison
is
out
of
place
in
grace
in
refined
thought
in
passive
fortitude
in
enduring
love
and
in
a
heart
to
be
filled
with
the
spirit
of
heaven
oh
i
know
all
this
nay
i
know
you
may
surpass
him
in
his
own
sphere
of
boasted
prudence
and
worldly
wisdom
about
dollars
and
cents
nevertheless
he
has
authority
from
god
to
rule
over
you
you
are
under
service
to
him
you
are
bound
to
obey
him
all
your
service
is
very
very
very
often
involuntary
from
the
first
and
if
voluntary
at
first
becomes
hopeless
necessity
afterwards
i
know
god
has
laid
upon
the
husband
to
love
you
as
christ
loved
the
church
and
in
that
sublime
obligation
has
placed
you
in
the
light
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
love
infinitely
higher
and
purer
and
holier
than
all
talked
about
in
the
romances
of
chivalry
but
the
husband
may
not
so
love
you
he
may
rule
you
with
the
rod
of
iron
what
can
you
do
be
divorced
god
forbids
it
save
for
crime
will
you
say
that
you
are
free
that
you
will
go
where
you
please
do
as
you
please
why
ye
dear
wives
your
husbands
may
forbid
and
listen
you
can
not
leave
new
york
nor
your
palaces
any
more
than
your
shanties
no
you
can
not
leave
your
parlor
nor
your
bedchamber
nor
your
couch
if
your
husband
commands
you
to
stay
there
what
can
you
do
will
you
run
away
with
your
stick
and
your
bundle
he
can
advertise
you
what
can
you
do
you
can
and
i
fear
some
of
you
do
wish
him
from
the
bottom
of
your
hearts
at
the
bottom
of
the
hudson
or
in
your
you
will
do
just
as
you
please
great
laughter
a
word
on
the
subject
of
divorce
one
of
your
standing
denunciations
on
the
south
is
the
terrible
laxity
of
the
marriage
vow
among
the
slaves
well
sir
what
does
your
boston
nehemiah
adams
say
he
says
after
giving
eighty
sixty
and
the
like
number
of
applications
for
divorce
and
nearly
all
granted
at
individual
quarterly
courts
in
new
england
he
says
he
is
not
sure
but
that
the
marriage
relation
is
as
enduring
among
slaves
in
the
as
it
is
among
white
people
in
new
england
i
only
give
what
adams
says
i
would
fain
vindicate
the
marriage
relation
from
this
rebuke
but
one
thing
i
will
say
you
seldom
hear
of
a
divorce
in
virginia
or
south
carolina
but
to
proceed
do
you
say
the
slave
is
and
bought
so
is
the
wife
the
world
over
everywhere
always
and
now
as
the
general
fact
however
done
away
or
modified
by
christianity
the
savage
buys
her
the
barbarian
buys
her
the
turk
buys
her
the
jew
buys
her
the
christian
buys
her
greek
armenian
nestorian
roman
catholic
protestant
the
portuguese
the
spaniard
the
italian
the
german
the
russian
the
frenchman
the
englishman
the
new
england
man
the
new
yorker
especially
the
upper
ten
the
in
many
very
many
cases
she
is
seldom
bought
in
the
south
and
never
among
the
slaves
themselves
for
they
always
marry
for
love
continued
laughter
sir
i
say
the
wife
is
bought
in
the
highest
circles
too
often
as
really
as
the
slave
is
bought
oh
she
is
not
sold
and
purchased
in
the
public
market
but
come
sir
with
me
and
let
us
take
the
privilege
of
spirits
out
of
the
body
to
glide
into
that
gilded
saloon
or
into
that
richly
comfortable
family
room
of
cabinets
and
pictures
and
statuary
see
the
parties
there
to
sell
and
buy
that
human
body
and
soul
and
make
her
a
chattel
see
how
they
sit
and
bend
towards
each
other
in
earnest
colloquy
on
sofa
of
rosewood
and
satin
carpet
how
befitting
under
feet
sunlight
over
head
softened
through
stained
windows
or
it
is
night
and
the
gas
is
turned
nearly
off
and
the
burners
gleam
like
stars
through
the
shadow
from
which
the
whisper
is
heard
in
which
that
old
ugly
brute
with
gray
goatee
how
fragrant
bids
one
two
five
ten
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
is
knocked
off
to
him
that
beautiful
young
girl
asleep
up
there
amid
flowers
and
innocent
that
she
is
sold
and
bought
sir
that
young
girl
would
as
soon
permit
a
baboon
to
embrace
her
as
that
old
ignorant
gross
disgusting
wretch
to
approach
her
ah
has
she
not
been
sold
and
bought
for
money
but
but
what
but
you
say
she
freely
and
without
parental
authority
accepted
him
then
she
sold
herself
for
money
and
was
guilty
of
which
is
nothing
better
than
legal
prostitution
i
know
what
i
say
you
know
what
i
say
up
there
in
the
gallery
you
know
you
nod
to
one
another
ah
you
know
the
parties
yes
you
say
all
true
true
true
laughter
now
moderator
i
will
clinch
all
i
have
said
by
nails
sure
and
fastened
from
the
word
of
god
there
is
king
james
english
bible
with
its
magnificent
dedication
i
bring
the
english
acknowledged
translation
and
just
one
word
more
to
push
gently
aside
for
i
am
a
kind
man
to
those
poor
deluded
people
their
last
argument
it
is
this
english
bible
in
those
parts
which
treat
of
slavery
do
give
the
ideas
which
are
found
in
the
original
hebrew
and
greek
alas
for
the
common
people
alas
for
this
good
old
translation
are
its
days
numbered
no
sir
no
sir
the
unitarian
the
universalist
the
arminian
the
baptist
when
pressed
by
this
translation
have
tried
to
find
shelter
for
their
false
isms
by
making
or
asking
for
a
new
rendering
and
now
the
men
are
driving
hard
at
the
same
thing
laughter
sir
shall
we
permit
our
people
everywhere
to
have
their
confidence
in
this
noble
translation
undermined
and
destroyed
by
the
isms
and
whims
of
every
or
any
man
in
our
pulpits
i
affirm
whatever
be
our
perfect
liberty
of
examination
into
god
meaning
in
all
the
light
of
the
original
languages
that
there
is
a
respect
due
to
this
received
version
and
that
great
caution
should
be
used
lest
we
teach
the
people
to
doubt
its
true
rendering
from
the
original
word
of
god
i
protest
sir
against
having
a
hebrew
or
greek
to
tell
the
people
what
god
has
spoken
on
the
subject
of
slavery
or
any
other
subject
laughter
i
would
as
soon
have
a
latin
priest
i
would
as
soon
have
archbishop
hughes
i
would
as
soon
go
to
rome
as
to
jerusalem
or
athens
i
would
as
soon
have
the
pope
at
once
in
his
fallible
infallibility
as
ten
or
twenty
little
or
big
priests
each
claiming
to
give
his
infallible
rendering
however
differing
from
his
peer
laughter
i
never
yet
produced
this
bible
in
its
plain
unanswerable
authority
for
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
but
the
man
ran
away
into
the
fog
of
hebrew
or
greek
laughter
or
he
jabbered
the
nonsense
that
god
permitted
the
of
slaveholding
among
the
jews
but
that
he
do
do
it
now
sir
god
sanctioned
slavery
then
and
sanctions
it
now
he
made
it
right
they
know
then
and
now
having
thus
taken
the
last
puff
of
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
the
phantom
ship
turn
to
the
chapter
of
exodus
god
in
these
verses
gave
the
israelites
his
command
how
they
should
buy
and
hold
the
hebrew
servant
how
under
certain
conditions
he
went
free
how
under
other
circumstances
he
might
be
held
to
service
forever
with
his
wife
and
her
children
there
it
is
do
run
into
the
hebrew
laughter
but
what
have
we
here
vs
and
if
a
man
sell
his
daughter
to
be
a
she
shall
not
go
out
as
the
do
if
she
please
not
her
master
who
hath
betrothed
her
to
himself
then
shall
he
let
her
be
redeemed
to
sell
her
unto
a
strange
nation
he
shall
have
no
power
seeing
he
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
her
and
if
he
hath
betrothed
her
unto
his
son
he
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
manner
of
daughters
if
he
take
him
another
wife
her
food
her
raiment
and
her
duty
of
marriage
shall
he
not
diminish
and
if
he
do
not
these
three
unto
her
then
shall
she
go
out
free
without
money
now
sir
the
wit
of
man
ca
dodge
that
passage
unless
he
runs
away
into
the
hebrew
great
laughter
for
what
does
god
say
why
this
that
an
israelite
might
sell
his
own
daughter
not
only
into
servitude
but
into
polygamy
that
the
buyer
might
if
he
pleased
give
her
to
his
son
for
a
wife
or
take
her
to
himself
if
he
took
her
to
himself
and
she
did
not
please
him
he
should
not
sell
her
unto
a
strange
nation
but
should
allow
her
to
be
redeemed
by
her
family
but
if
he
took
him
another
wife
before
he
allowed
the
first
one
to
be
redeemed
he
should
continue
to
give
the
first
one
her
and
her
of
that
is
to
say
right
to
his
if
he
did
not
do
three
she
should
go
out
free
cease
to
be
his
slave
without
his
receiving
any
money
for
her
there
sir
god
sanctioned
the
israelite
father
in
selling
his
daughter
and
the
israelite
man
to
buy
her
into
slavery
and
into
polygamy
and
it
was
then
right
because
god
made
it
right
in
verses
and
you
have
these
words
and
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
he
shall
be
surely
punished
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
what
does
this
passage
mean
surely
this
if
the
master
gave
his
slave
a
hasty
blow
with
a
rod
and
he
died
under
his
hand
he
should
be
punished
but
if
the
slave
lived
a
day
or
two
it
would
so
extenuate
the
act
of
the
master
he
should
not
be
punished
inasmuch
as
he
would
be
in
that
case
sufficiently
punished
in
losing
his
money
in
his
slave
now
sir
i
affirm
that
god
was
more
lenient
to
the
degraded
hebrew
master
than
southern
laws
are
to
the
higher
southern
master
in
like
cases
but
there
you
have
what
was
the
divine
will
find
fault
with
god
ye
men
if
you
dare
in
leviticus
xxv
both
thy
bondmen
and
thy
bondmaids
which
thou
shalt
have
shall
be
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondmaids
moreover
of
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
and
of
their
families
that
are
with
you
which
they
beget
in
your
land
and
they
shall
be
your
possession
and
ye
shall
take
them
as
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
forever
sir
i
do
not
see
how
god
could
tell
us
more
plainly
that
he
did
command
his
people
to
buy
slaves
from
the
heathen
round
about
them
and
from
the
stranger
and
of
their
families
sojourning
among
them
the
passage
has
no
other
meaning
did
god
merely
permit
sin
did
he
merely
tolerate
a
dreadful
evil
god
does
not
say
so
anywhere
he
gives
his
people
law
to
buy
and
hold
slaves
of
the
heathen
forever
on
certain
conditions
and
to
buy
and
hold
hebrew
slaves
in
particulars
well
how
did
the
heathen
then
get
slaves
to
sell
did
they
capture
them
in
war
did
they
sell
their
own
children
wherever
they
got
them
they
sold
them
and
god
law
gave
his
people
the
right
to
buy
them
god
in
the
new
testament
made
no
law
prohibiting
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
but
he
made
law
regulating
the
relation
under
greek
and
roman
slavery
which
was
the
most
oppressive
in
the
world
god
saw
that
these
regulations
would
ultimately
remove
the
evils
in
the
greek
and
roman
systems
and
do
it
away
entirely
from
the
fitness
of
things
as
there
existing
for
greek
and
roman
slaves
for
the
most
part
were
the
equals
in
all
respects
of
their
masters
æsop
was
a
slave
terence
was
a
slave
the
precepts
in
colossians
iv
tim
vi
and
other
places
show
unanswerably
that
god
as
really
sanctioned
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
as
those
of
husband
and
wife
and
parent
and
child
and
that
all
the
obligations
of
the
moral
law
and
christ
law
of
love
might
and
must
be
as
truly
fulfilled
in
the
one
relation
as
in
the
other
the
fact
that
he
has
made
the
one
set
of
relations
permanent
and
the
other
more
or
less
dependent
on
conditions
of
mankind
or
to
pass
away
in
the
advancement
of
human
progress
does
not
touch
the
question
he
sanctioned
it
under
the
old
testament
and
the
new
and
ordains
it
now
while
he
sees
it
best
to
continue
it
and
he
now
as
heretofore
proclaims
the
duty
of
the
master
and
the
slave
parker
admirable
explanation
of
colossians
and
other
new
testament
passages
saves
me
the
necessity
of
saying
any
thing
more
on
the
scripture
argument
one
word
on
the
detroit
resolutions
and
i
conclude
those
resolutions
of
the
assembly
of
decide
that
slavery
is
sin
unless
the
master
holds
his
slave
as
a
guardian
or
under
the
claims
of
humanity
moderator
i
think
we
had
on
this
floor
yesterday
proof
conclusive
that
those
resolutions
mean
any
thing
or
nothing
that
they
are
a
fine
specimen
of
northern
skill
in
that
it
put
in
a
plank
here
to
please
this
man
a
plank
there
to
please
that
man
a
plank
for
the
north
a
broad
board
for
the
south
it
is
jackson
judicious
tariff
it
is
a
conscience
stretched
now
to
a
charity
covering
all
the
multitude
of
our
southern
sins
contracted
now
giving
us
hardly
a
of
righteousness
it
is
a
bowl
of
punch
a
little
sugar
to
make
it
sweet
a
little
lemon
to
make
it
sour
a
little
water
to
make
it
weak
a
little
brandy
to
give
it
power
laughter
as
a
northern
argument
against
us
it
is
a
mass
of
lead
so
heavy
that
it
weighed
down
even
the
strong
shoulders
of
judge
jessup
for
sir
when
he
closed
his
speech
i
asked
him
a
single
question
i
had
made
ready
for
him
it
was
this
do
you
allow
that
aiken
of
south
carolina
may
under
the
claims
of
humanity
hold
three
thousand
slaves
or
must
he
emancipate
them
the
judge
staggered
and
stammered
and
said
no
man
could
rightly
hold
so
many
i
then
asked
how
many
may
he
hold
in
humanity
the
judge
saw
his
fatal
dilemma
he
recovered
himself
handsomely
and
fairly
said
aiken
might
hold
three
thousand
slaves
in
harmony
with
the
detroit
action
i
replied
then
sir
you
have
surrendered
the
whole
question
of
southern
slavery
and
sir
the
judge
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
surrendered
it
and
every
man
in
this
house
capable
of
understanding
the
force
of
that
question
felt
it
had
shivered
the
whole
argument
on
those
resolutions
to
atoms
why
sir
if
a
man
can
hold
three
slaves
with
a
right
heart
and
the
approbation
of
god
he
may
hold
thirty
three
hundred
three
thousand
or
thirty
thousand
it
is
a
mere
question
of
heart
and
capacity
to
govern
the
emperor
of
russia
holds
sixty
millions
of
slaves
and
is
there
a
man
in
this
house
so
much
of
a
fool
as
to
say
that
god
regards
the
emperor
of
russia
a
sinner
because
he
is
the
master
of
sixty
millions
of
slaves
sir
that
emperor
has
certainly
a
high
and
awful
responsibility
upon
him
but
if
he
is
good
as
he
is
great
he
is
a
god
of
benevolence
on
earth
and
so
is
every
southern
master
his
obligation
is
high
and
great
and
glorious
it
is
the
same
obligation
in
kind
he
is
under
to
his
wife
and
children
and
in
some
respects
immensely
higher
by
reason
of
the
number
and
the
tremendous
interests
involved
for
time
and
eternity
in
connection
with
this
great
country
africa
and
the
world
yes
sir
whether
southern
masters
fully
know
it
or
not
that
hold
from
individually
and
collectively
highest
and
the
noblest
responsibility
ever
given
by
him
to
individual
private
men
on
all
the
face
of
the
for
god
has
intrusted
to
them
to
train
millions
of
the
most
degraded
in
form
and
intellect
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
gentle
the
most
amiable
the
most
affectionate
the
most
imitative
the
most
susceptible
of
social
and
religious
love
of
all
the
races
of
mankind
to
train
them
and
to
give
them
civilization
and
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
and
i
thank
god
he
has
given
this
great
work
to
that
type
of
the
noble
family
of
japheth
best
qualified
to
do
it
to
the
cavalier
stock
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
of
england
and
france
born
to
command
and
softened
and
refined
under
our
southern
sky
may
they
know
and
feel
and
fulfil
their
destiny
oh
may
they
know
that
they
also
have
a
master
in
heaven
letter
from
ross
i
need
only
say
in
reference
to
this
letter
that
my
friends
having
questioned
my
position
as
to
the
good
of
the
agitation
i
wrote
the
following
letter
to
vindicate
that
point
as
given
in
the
new
york
speech
huntsville
july
i
affirmed
in
my
new
york
speech
that
the
slavery
agitation
has
done
and
will
accomplish
good
your
very
kind
and
courteous
disagreement
on
that
point
i
will
make
the
occasion
to
say
something
more
thereon
without
wishing
you
my
dear
friend
to
regard
what
i
write
as
inviting
any
discussion
i
said
agitation
has
brought
out
and
would
reveal
still
more
fully
the
bible
in
its
relation
to
slavery
and
liberty
also
the
infidelity
which
long
has
been
and
is
now
leavening
with
death
the
whole
northern
mind
and
that
it
would
result
in
the
triumph
of
the
southern
interpretation
of
the
bible
to
the
honor
of
god
and
to
the
good
of
the
master
the
slave
the
stability
of
the
union
and
be
a
blessing
to
the
world
to
accomplish
this
the
sin
doctrine
will
be
utterly
demolished
that
doctrine
is
the
difficulty
in
every
mind
where
there
is
any
difficulty
about
slavery
whether
they
confess
it
or
not
yes
the
difficulty
with
every
northern
man
is
that
relation
master
and
slave
is
felt
sin
i
know
that
to
be
the
fact
i
have
talked
with
all
grades
of
northern
men
and
come
in
contact
with
all
varieties
of
northern
mind
on
this
subject
and
i
know
that
the
man
who
says
and
tries
to
believe
and
does
partially
in
sober
judgment
believe
that
slavery
is
not
sin
yet
his
feelings
in
his
educated
he
feels
that
slavery
is
sin
yes
is
the
difficulty
and
is
the
whole
of
the
difficulty
the
north
and
the
so
far
as
the
question
is
one
of
the
bible
and
morals
now
i
again
say
that
that
per
doctrine
will
in
this
agitation
be
utterly
demolished
and
when
that
is
done
when
the
north
will
know
and
feel
fully
perfectly
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
not
sin
but
sanctioned
of
god
then
and
not
till
then
the
north
and
south
can
and
will
without
anger
consider
the
following
questions
whether
slavery
as
it
exists
in
the
united
states
all
things
considered
be
or
be
not
a
great
good
and
the
greatest
good
for
a
time
notwithstanding
its
admitted
evils
again
whether
these
evils
can
or
can
not
be
modified
and
removed
lastly
whether
slavery
itself
can
or
can
not
pass
away
from
this
land
and
the
world
now
sir
the
moment
the
sin
question
is
settled
then
all
is
peace
for
these
other
questions
belong
entirely
to
another
category
of
morals
they
belong
entirely
to
the
category
of
wise
good
this
agitation
will
bring
this
great
result
and
therefore
i
affirm
the
agitation
to
be
good
there
is
another
fact
also
the
result
in
great
measure
of
this
agitation
which
in
my
view
proves
it
to
have
been
and
to
be
of
great
good
i
mean
the
astonishing
rise
and
present
stability
of
the
of
the
united
states
this
fact
when
examined
is
undeniable
and
it
is
equally
undeniable
that
it
has
been
caused
in
great
part
by
the
slavery
question
in
all
its
bearings
it
is
a
wonderful
development
made
by
god
and
i
must
believe
he
intends
thereby
either
to
destroy
or
bless
this
great
union
but
as
i
believe
he
intends
to
bless
therefore
i
am
fortified
in
affirming
the
good
there
has
been
and
is
in
this
agitation
let
me
bring
out
to
view
this
astonishing
fact
years
ago
and
previously
the
whole
south
and
west
had
a
strong
tendency
to
emancipation
in
some
form
but
the
abolition
movement
then
began
and
arrested
that
southern
and
western
leaning
to
emancipation
many
people
have
said
and
do
say
that
that
was
and
is
a
great
evil
i
say
it
was
and
is
a
great
good
why
answer
it
was
and
would
now
be
premature
had
it
been
carried
out
it
would
have
been
and
would
now
be
evil
immense
inconceivable
to
master
slave
america
africa
and
the
world
because
neither
master
slave
america
africa
the
world
were
or
are
ready
for
emancipation
god
has
a
great
deal
to
do
before
he
is
ready
for
emancipation
he
tells
us
so
by
this
put
upon
that
tendency
to
emancipation
years
ago
for
he
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
abolitionists
make
the
and
he
stopped
the
southern
movement
all
the
more
perfectly
by
permitting
great
britain
to
emancipate
jamaica
and
letting
that
experiment
prove
as
it
has
a
perfect
failure
and
a
terrible
warning
jamaica
is
destroyed
and
now
whatever
be
done
for
its
negroes
must
be
done
with
the
full
admission
that
what
has
been
attempted
was
in
violation
of
the
duty
britain
owed
to
those
negroes
but
her
failure
in
seeing
and
doing
her
duty
god
has
given
to
us
to
teach
us
knowledge
and
through
us
to
instruct
the
world
in
the
demonstration
of
the
problem
of
slavery
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
northern
men
especially
abolitionists
to
give
texas
to
the
south
texas
a
territory
so
vast
that
a
bird
as
webster
said
ca
fly
over
it
in
a
week
many
in
the
south
did
not
want
texas
but
many
ones
did
want
it
and
northern
men
voted
and
gave
to
the
south
exactly
what
these
southern
statesmen
wanted
this
i
grant
was
northern
fatuity
utterly
unaccountable
but
that
god
made
them
do
it
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
northern
men
especially
abolitionists
to
vote
for
polk
dallas
and
texas
this
gave
us
the
mexican
war
and
that
immense
territory
its
spoil
a
territory
which
although
it
may
not
be
favorable
for
has
increased
and
will
in
many
ways
extend
the
this
leads
me
to
say
that
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
many
northern
men
especially
abolitionists
to
believe
what
great
britain
said
namely
that
would
result
in
lo
the
wanted
free
so
northern
abolitionists
helped
to
destroy
the
and
thus
to
expand
the
demand
for
and
the
culture
of
cotton
now
see
the
gold
of
california
has
free
by
enabling
our
merchants
to
meet
the
enormous
demand
for
specie
created
by
free
trade
so
california
helps
the
but
the
abolitionists
gave
us
polk
the
mexican
war
and
california
god
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
north
and
especially
abolitionists
to
stimulate
the
settlement
of
new
free
states
and
to
be
the
ardent
friends
of
an
immense
foreign
emigration
the
result
has
been
to
send
down
to
the
south
with
railroad
speed
and
certainty
corn
wheat
flour
meal
bacon
pork
beef
and
every
other
imaginable
form
of
food
in
quantity
amazing
and
so
cheap
that
the
planter
can
spread
wider
and
wider
the
culture
of
cotton
god
has
by
this
growth
of
the
northwest
made
the
demand
for
cotton
enormous
in
the
north
and
northwest
again
he
has
made
english
and
french
experiments
to
procure
cotton
somewhere
else
than
from
the
united
states
in
the
east
indies
egypt
algeria
brazil
god
has
thus
given
to
the
southern
planter
an
absolute
monopoly
a
monopoly
so
great
that
he
the
southern
planter
sits
now
upon
his
throne
of
cotton
and
wields
the
commercial
sceptre
of
the
world
yes
it
is
the
southern
planter
who
says
to
haughty
england
go
to
war
if
you
dare
dismiss
dallas
if
you
dare
yes
he
who
sits
on
the
throne
of
the
has
triumphed
at
last
over
him
who
sits
on
the
throne
of
the
england
is
prostrate
at
his
feet
as
well
as
the
abolitionists
god
has
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
abolitionists
to
prevent
half
a
million
of
free
negroes
from
going
to
liberia
and
thereby
the
abolitionists
have
made
them
consumers
of
to
the
extension
of
the
and
by
thus
keeping
them
in
america
the
abolitionists
have
so
increased
their
degradation
as
to
prove
all
the
more
the
utter
folly
of
emancipation
in
the
united
states
god
has
permitted
the
men
in
the
north
in
england
in
france
and
everywhere
so
to
blind
themselves
in
hypocrisy
as
to
give
the
southern
his
last
perfect
triumph
over
them
for
god
tells
the
planter
to
say
to
the
north
to
england
to
france
to
all
who
buy
cotton
ye
men
of
boston
new
york
london
paris
ye
hypocrites
ye
brand
me
as
a
pirate
a
kidnapper
a
murderer
a
demon
fit
only
for
hell
and
yet
ye
buy
my
cotton
o
ye
hypocrites
ye
boston
hypocrites
why
do
ye
throw
the
cotton
in
the
sea
as
your
fathers
did
the
tea
ye
boston
hypocrites
ye
say
we
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
we
would
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
in
the
blood
of
the
wherefore
ye
be
witnesses
unto
yourselves
that
ye
are
the
children
of
them
who
in
fact
kidnapped
and
bought
in
blood
and
sold
the
slave
in
america
for
now
ye
hypocrites
ye
buy
the
cotton
in
quantity
so
immense
that
have
run
up
the
price
of
slaves
to
be
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
the
average
of
old
and
young
o
ye
hypocrites
ye
denounce
slavery
then
ye
bid
it
live
and
not
die
in
that
ye
buy
sugar
rice
tobacco
and
above
all
cotton
ye
hypocrites
ye
abuse
the
devil
and
then
fall
down
and
worship
him
ye
hypocrites
ye
new

hypocrites
ye
old
england
hypocrites
ye
french
hypocrites
ye

hypocrites
ye

hypocrites
ye
rhode
island
consociation
hypocrites
oh
your
holy
twaddle
stinks
in
the
nostrils
of
god
and
he
commands
me
to
lash
you
with
my
scorn
and
his
scorn
so
long
as
ye
gabble
about
the
sin
of
slavery
and
then
bow
down
to
me
and
buy
and
spin
cotton
and
thus
work
for
me
as
truly
as
my
slaves
o
ye
fools
and
blind
fill
ye
up
the
measure
of
your
folly
and
blindness
and
shame
and
this
ye
are
doing
ye
have
like
the
french
infidels
made
your
goddess
and
are
exalting
her
above
the
bible
and
in
your
unitarianism
and
neology
and
all
modes
of
infidelity
ye
are
rejecting
and
crucifying
the
son
of
god
now
my
brother
this
controlling
is
a
fact
its
statistics
of
bales
count
by
millions
its
tonnage
counts
by
hundreds
of
thousands
its
manufacture
is
reckoned
by
the
workshops
of
america
and
europe
its
supporters
are
numbered
by
all
who
must
thus
be
clothed
in
the
world
this
tremendous
power
has
been
developed
in
great
measure
by
the
abolition
agitation
controlled
by
god
i
believe
then
as
i
have
already
said
that
god
intends
one
of
two
things
he
either
intends
to
destroy
the
united
states
by
this
or
he
intends
to
bless
my
country
and
the
world
by
the
unfoldings
of
his
wisdom
in
this
matter
i
believe
he
will
bless
the
world
in
the
working
out
of
this
slavery
i
rejoice
then
in
the
agitation
which
has
so
resulted
and
will
so
terminate
to
reveal
the
bible
and
bless
mankind
your
affectionate
friend
ross
rev
blackburn
what
is
the
foundation
of
moral
obligation
my
position
as
to
this
question
in
my
new
york
speech
was
made
subject
of
remark
in
the
presbyterian
herald
louisville
kentucky
to
which
i
replied
at
length
in
the
presbyterian
witness
knoxville
tennessee
no
rejoinder
was
ever
made
to
that
reply
but
recently
an
extract
from
the
younger
edwards
was
submitted
to
me
to
that
i
gave
the
following
letter
the
subject
is
of
the
first
and
the
last
importance
and
bears
directly
as
set
forth
in
my
new
york
speech
on
infidelity
and
of
course
the
slavery
question
editor
in
your
paper
of
tuesday
there
is
an
article
under
this
head
giving
the
argument
of
edwards
the
son
against
my
views
as
to
foundation
of
moral
i
thank
the
writer
for
his
argument
and
his
courteous
manner
of
presenting
it
in
my
third
letter
to
barnes
i
express
my
preparation
to
meet
on
this
question
and
i
am
pleased
to
see
this
if
my
views
can
not
be
refuted
by
edwards
i
may
wait
long
for
an
a
word
introductory
to
your
correspondent
he
says
his
ross
theory
was
advanced
and
argued
against
in
a
former
age
by
this
i
understand
him
to
express
his
belief
that
my
theory
has
been
rejected
heretofore
well
it
may
nevertheless
be
the
true
theory
the
copernican
astronomy
was
argued
against
in
a
former
age
and
rejected
yet
it
has
prevailed
newton
law
of
gravitation
was
argued
against
and
rejected
by
a
whole
generation
of
philosophers
on
the
continent
of
europe
yet
it
has
prevailed
and
now
all
and
girls
would
call
anybody
a
fool
who
should
deny
it
steam
in
all
its
applications
was
argued
against
and
rejected
yet
it
has
prevailed
so
the
electric
telegraph
and
to
go
back
a
little
the
theory
of
vaccination
the
circulation
of
the
blood
a
thousand
things
yea
edwards
the
father
theory
of
virtue
although
received
by
many
has
been
argued
against
and
by
many
rejected
yet
it
will
prevail
yea
his
idea
of
the
unity
of
the
race
in
adam
was
and
is
argued
against
and
rejected
yet
it
will
prevail
i
feel
therefore
no
fear
that
my
theory
of
moral
obligation
will
not
be
acknowledged
because
it
was
argued
against
and
rejected
by
many
in
a
former
age
and
may
be
now
nay
facts
to
prove
it
are
accumulating
facts
which
were
not
developed
in
edwards
day
facts
showing
irresistibly
that
theory
which
is
most
usually
now
held
is
what
i
say
it
is
rejection
of
revelation
infidelity
and
the
evidence
amounts
to
demonstration
the
question
is
in
a
nutshell
it
is
this
man
submit
to
the
revealed
will
of
or
his
own
will
that
is
the
naked
question
when
the
fog
of
confused
ideas
and
unmeaning
words
is
lifted
and
dispersed
my
position
expressed
in
the
speech
delivered
in
the
general
assembly
new
york
may
is
this
god
in
making
all
things
saw
that
in
the
relations
he
would
constitute
between
himself
and
intelligent
creatures
and
among
themselves
natural
good
and
evil
would
come
to
pass
in
his
benevolent
wisdom
he
then
law
to
control
this
and
and
he
thereby
made
to
that
law
to
be
and
to
be
why
simply
because
he
saw
it
to
be
and
it
to
right
not
because
saw
it
to
be
but
because
made
it
to
be
your
correspondent
replies
to
this
theory
in
the
following
words
of
edwards
some
hold
that
the
foundation
of
moral
obligation
is
primarily
in
the
will
of
god
but
the
will
of
god
is
either
benevolent
or
not
if
it
be
benevolent
and
on
that
account
the
foundation
of
moral
obligation
it
is
not
the
source
of
obligation
merely
because
it
is
the
will
of
god
but
because
it
is
benevolent
and
is
of
a
tendency
to
promote
happiness
and
this
places
the
foundation
of
obligation
in
a
tendency
to
happiness
and
not
primarily
in
the
will
of
god
but
if
the
will
of
god
and
that
which
is
the
expression
of
it
the
divine
law
be
allowed
to
be
not
benevolent
and
are
foundation
of
obligation
we
are
obliged
to
conform
to
them
whatever
they
be
however
malevolent
and
opposite
to
holiness
and
goodness
the
requirements
be
but
this
i
presume
none
will
pretend
very
fairly
and
strongly
put
that
to
say
if
i
understand
edwards
he
supposes
if
god
was
the
devil
and
man
what
he
is
then
man
would
not
be
under
obligation
to
obey
the
devil
will
that
it
well
i
suppose
so
too
and
i
reckon
most
would
agree
to
that
statement
nay
more
i
presume
nobody
ever
taught
that
the
mere
naked
abstractly
considered
if
it
could
be
from
the
of
god
was
the
ground
of
moral
obligation
nay
i
think
nobody
ever
imagined
that
the
notion
of
an
infinite
creator
presupposes
or
includes
the
idea
that
he
is
a
malevolent
being
i
agree
then
with
edwards
that
the
ultimate
ground
of
obligation
in
the
that
god
is
benevolent
or
is
a
good
god
i
said
in
my
speech
quoted
above
i
formally
stated
that
in
his
benevolent
wisdom
willed
law
to
control
the
natural
good
and
what
then
is
the
point
of
disagreement
between
my
view
and
edwards
it
is
in
different
ways
by
which
get
at
fact
divine
i
hold
that
the
revealed
word
us
who
god
is
and
what
he
and
is
therefore
the
ultimate
ground
of
obligation
but
edwards
holds
that
human
reason
tell
us
who
god
is
and
what
he
and
is
therefore
the
primary
ground
of
obedience
is
my
issue
with
edwards
and
others
and
it
is
as
broad
an
issue
as
in
or
the
rejection
of
it
i
do
not
charge
that
edwards
did
or
that
all
who
hold
with
him
do
deny
the
word
of
god
but
i
do
affirm
that
their
argument
does
the
matter
is
plain
for
what
is
revelation
it
is
that
god
has
appeared
in
person
and
man
in
word
that
he
is
god
and
him
first
in
word
to
be
expanded
in
studying
and
that
god
is
a
spirit
eternal
infinite
in
power
wisdom
goodness
holiness
the
creator
preserver
benefactor
that
word
moreover
he
proved
by
highest
evidence
namely
supernatural
evidence
to
be
truth
as
to
all
fact
affirmed
and
he
revelation
as
claimed
in
the
bible
was
and
is
that
thing
man
then
having
this
revelation
is
under
obligation
ever
to
believe
every
jot
and
tittle
of
that
word
he
at
first
no
doubt
knew
little
of
the
meaning
of
some
declared
nay
he
may
have
comprehended
nothing
of
the
sense
or
scope
of
many
affirmed
nay
he
may
now
after
thousands
of
years
know
most
imperfectly
the
meaning
of
that
word
but
he
was
and
he
is
notwithstanding
to
believe
with
absolute
faith
the
word
that
god
all
he
says
he
is
and
all
he
says
he
does
however
that
word
may
his
reason
or
his
feelings
or
his
conscience
or
his
will
this
statement
of
what
revelation
is
settles
the
whole
question
as
presented
by
edwards
for
revelation
as
explained
does
fix
the
foundation
of
man
moral
obligation
in
the
benevolence
of
primarily
as
it
is
in
the
word
of
god
revelation
does
then
in
that
sense
fix
in
mere
will
of
god
for
the
moment
you
attempt
to
establish
the
foundation
you
have
abandoned
the
ground
of
revelation
you
have
left
the
will
of
god
his
and
you
have
made
your
rule
of
right
to
be
the
will
of
man
self
heart
the
proof
of
what
i
here
say
is
so
plain
even
as
the
writing
on
the
tables
of
habakkuk
vision
that
he
may
run
that
readeth
it
read
then
even
as
on
the
god
in
his
word
i
am
the
creator
you
may
be
says
edwards
but
i
want
for
my
faith
and
i
ca
take
your
for
it
i
must
look
first
into
to
see
if
evidence
of
infinite
power
and
wisdom
is
there
to
see
if
evidence
of
a
creator
is
there
and
if
thou
art
he
again
god
in
his
word
i
am
benevolent
and
in
my
law
is
expression
of
that
benevolence
you
may
tell
the
truth
edwards
replies
but
i
want
for
my
belief
and
i
must
hold
your
word
suspended
until
i
examine
into
my
reason
my
feelings
my
conscience
my
will
to
see
if
your
word
with
my
heart
to
see
if
what
you
reveal
tends
to
in
my
notion
of
happiness
tends
to
in
my
notion
of
right
that
it
that
the
theory
of
edwards
barnes
and
others
and
what
is
this
but
the
attempt
to
know
the
divine
attributes
and
character
in
other
than
through
the
divine
word
and
what
is
this
but
the
denial
of
the
divine
word
except
so
far
as
it
agrees
with
the
knowledge
of
the
attributes
and
character
of
god
obtained
in
that
other
way
and
what
is
this
but
to
make
the
word
of
god
to
the
teaching
of
the
human
heart
and
what
is
this
but
to
make
the
will
give
place
to
the
will
man
and
what
is
this
but
the
rejection
of
revelation
yet
this
is
the
result
though
not
intended
by
him
of
the
whole
scheme
of
obligation
maintained
by
edwards
and
by
all
who
agree
with
him
carry
it
out
and
what
is
the
progress
and
the
end
of
it
this
human
reason
the
human
heart
will
be
supreme
some
i
grant
will
hold
to
a
revelation
of
some
sort
a
thing
more
and
more
transcendental
a
thing
more
and
more
of
fog
and
moonshine
fog
floating
in
german
cellars
from
fumes
of
and
moonshine
gleaming
from
the
imaginations
of
the
drinkers
some
like
socrates
and
plato
will
have
a
god
supreme
personal
glorious
somewhat
like

and
with
him
many
inferior
deities
animating
the
stars
the
earth
mountains
valleys
plains
the

rivers
fountains
the
air
trees
flowers
and
all

things
some
will

and
conceive
instead
the

mind
of
the
universe
without
love
some
will
contend
for
mere
law
of
gravitation
and
attraction
and
some
will
suggest
that
all
is
the
result
of
a
fortuitous
concourse
of
atoms
here
having
passed
through
the
shadows
and
the
darkness
we
have
reached
the
blackness
of
infidelity
blank
atheism
no
god
yea
all
the
way
the
were
saying
in
their
hearts
no
god
what
now
is
man
alas
some
the
notts
and
gliddons
tell
us
man
was
indeed
millions
of
ages
ago
the
lord
only
knows
when
in
swarms
like
bees
to
suit
the
zones
of
the
earth
while
other
some
the
believers
in
the
of
say
man
is
the
result
of
development
from
fire
dust
granite
grass
the
creeping
thing
bird
fish
beast
monkey
yea
and
some
of
these
last
philosophers
are
even
now
going
to
africa
to
try
to
find
men
they
have
heard
tell
of
who
still
have
tails
and
are
jumping
and
climbing
somewhere
in
the
regions
around
the
undiscovered
sources
of
the
nile
this
is
the
progress
and
the
result
of
the
edwards
theory
because
deny
or
hesitate
about
revelation
and
man
can
not
prove
any
of
the
things
we
are
considering
let
us
see
if
he
can
edwards
writes
on
the
supposition
that
the
will
or
law
of
god
is
the
primary
foundation
reason
and
standard
of
right
and
virtue
every
attempt
prove
the
moral
perfection
or
attributes
of
god
is
here
then
edwards
believes
that
to
reach
the
primary
foundation
of
right
and
virtue
he
must
not
take
god
word
as
to
his
perfection
or
attributes
no
matter
how
fully
may
have
his
word
no
but
he
edwards
he
man
must
first
them
in
other
and
of
course
he
believes
he
can
reach
such
primary
foundation
by
such
other
proof
well
let
us
see
how
he
goes
about
it
i
give
him
to
try
his
hand
the
easiest
attribute
power
i
give
him
then
all
creation
and
providence
besides
as
his
on
which
to
work
his
demonstration
i
give
him
then
the
lifetime
of
methuselah
in
which
to
reach
his
conclusion
of
well
i
will
now
suppose
we
have
all
lived
and
waited
that
long
time
what
is
his
of
infinite
power
has
he
found
the
exhibition
of
power
no
he
has
found
of
great
power
but
he
has
not
reached
the
display
of
what
then
is
his
in
infinite
power
after
such
why
just
this
he
infers
that
the
power
did
the
things
he
sees
can
go
on
and
on
and
on
to
give
greater
and
greater
and
greater
manifestations
of
itself
very
good
so
be
we
can
have
no
better
but
proof
is
infinitely
below
absolute
proof
infinite
and
all
manifestations
of
power
to
a
even
to
the
archangel
michael
during
countless
millions
of
ages
never
gives
because
it
never
can
give
to
him
absolute
proof
infinite
but
the
word
of
god
gives
the
proof
absolute
in
a
moment
of
time
i
am
the
almighty
the
is
in
that
word
of
god
i
might
set
edwards
to
work
to
prove
the
the
the
yea
the
existence
of
god
and
he
finite
man
in
any
examination
of
creation
or
providence
must
fall
infinitely
below
the
perfect
proof
so
then
i
tell
edwards
and
all
agreeing
with
him
that
is
to
attempt
to
the
moral
perfection
and
attributes
of
god
if
he
thereby
seeks
to
reach
the
highest
evidence
if
he
thereby
means
to
find
primary
ground
moral
do
i
then
teach
that
man
should
not
seek
the
there
is
of
the
perfection
and
attributes
of
god
in
and
no
i
hold
that
such
proof
unfolds
the
of
the
facts
declared
in
the
word
of
god
and
is
as
such
expansion
of
meaning
but
i
say
by
authority
of
the
master
that
highest
proof
the
absolute
proof
the
perfect
of
the
facts
as
to
god
is
and
what
he
and
the
primary
obligation
is
in
revealed
word
fred
ross
huntsville
april
in
notice
of
last
witness
extract
from
erskine
i
remark
that
thomas
erskine
was
and
may
yet
be
a
lawyer
of
edinburgh
he
wrote
on
the
the
on
the
on
the
of
the
they
are
all
written
with
great
ability
and
contain
much
truth
but
all
have
in
them
fundamental
there
is
least
in
the
evidences
more
in
the
essay
on
faith
most
in
the
tract
on
the
freeness
of
the
gospel
which
last
has
been
utterly
refuted
and
has
passed
away
his
is
also
not
republished
the
evidences
is
good
like
good
men
notwithstanding
the
evil
letters
to
rev
barnes
introduction
as
part
of
the
great
slavery
discussion
rev
barnes
of
philadelphia
published
in
october
a
pamphlet
entitled
the
church
and
slavery
in
this
tract
he
invites
every
man
to
utter
his
views
on
the
subject
and
setting
the
example
he
speaks
his
own
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
honesty
in
the
same
freedom
of
speech
i
have
considered
his
views
unscriptural
false
fanatical
and
infidel
therefore
while
i
hold
him
in
the
highest
respect
esteem
and
affection
as
a
divine
and
christian
gentleman
and
cherish
his
past
relations
to
me
yet
i
have
in
these
letters
written
to
him
and
of
him
just
as
i
would
have
done
had
he
lived
in
france
or
germany
a
stranger
to
me
and
given
to
the
world
the
refined
scoff
of
the
one
or
the
muddy
transcendentalism
of
the
other
my
first
letter
is
merely
a
glance
at
some
things
in
his
pamphlet
in
which
i
show
wherein
i
agree
and
disagree
with
him
in
our
estimate
of
the
results
of
the
agitation
in
our
views
of
the
declaration
of
independence
in
our
belief
of
the
way
men
are
made
infidels
and
in
our
appreciation
of
the
testimonies
of
past
general
assemblies
the
other
letters
i
will
notice
in
similar
introductions
these
letters
first
appeared
as
original
contributions
to
the
christian
observer
published
and
edited
by
converse
philadelphia
i
take
this
occasion
to
express
my
regard
for
him
and
my
sense
of
the
ability
with
which
he
has
long
maintained
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
presbyterian
body
to
which
we
both
belong
and
the
wise
and
masterly
way
in
which
he
has
vindicated
from
the
bible
the
truth
on
the
slavery
question
to
him
too
the
public
is
indebted
for
the
first
exhibition
of
barnes
errors
in
his
recent
tract
which
has
called
forth
my
reply
no
rev
barnes
you
have
recently
published
a
tract
the
church
and
slavery
the
opinion
of
each
individual
you
remark
contributes
to
form
public
sentiment
as
the
labor
of
the
animalcule
in
the
ocean
contributes
to
the
coral
reefs
that
rise
above
the
waves
true
sir
and
beautifully
expressed
but
while
in
harmony
with
your
intimation
i
must
regard
you
one
of
the
animalcules
rearing
the
coral
reef
of
public
opinion
i
can
not
admit
your
disclaimer
of
special
influence
among
them
in
their
work
doubtless
sir
you
have
special
influence
and
deserve
to
have
i
make
no
apology
for
addressing
you
i
am
one
of
the
animalcules
i
agree
and
i
disagree
with
you
i
harmonize
in
your
words
the
present
is
eminently
a
time
when
the
views
of
every
man
on
the
subject
of
slavery
should
be
uttered
in
unambiguous
tones
i
agree
with
you
in
this
affirmation
because
the
subject
has
yet
to
be
fully
understood
because
when
understood
if
the
bible
does
sanction
the
system
the
master
must
cease
to
be
the
master
the
slave
must
cease
to
be
the
slave
he
must
be
and
equal
in
political
and
social
life
is
your
let
it
be
heard
if
is
the
word
of
god
but
if
the
bible
sanction
the
system
then
unambiguous
tone
will
silence
abolitionists
who
admit
the
scriptures
it
will
satisfy
all
good
men
and
give
peace
to
the
country
that
is
the
i
want
men
to
hear
listen
to
it
in
the
past
and
present
speech
of
providence
the
time
was
when
had
the
very
you
are
now
trying
to
form
from
maine
to
louisiana
the
american
mind
was
softly
yielding
to
the
impress
of
emancipation
in
some
hope
however
vague
and
imaginary
southern
as
well
as
northern
men
in
the
church
and
out
of
it
not
having
sufficiently
studied
the
word
of
god
and
under
our
own
and
french
revolutionary
excitement
looking
only
at
the
evils
of
slavery
wished
it
away
from
the
land
it
was
a
public
sentiment
yet
such
as
it
was
you
had
it
and
it
was
doing
your
work
it
was
mild
and
affectionate
it
did
not
however
work
fast
enough
for
you
you
thought
that
the
negro
with
his
superior
attributes
of
body
and
mind
and
higher
advantages
of
the
nineteenth
century
might
reach
in
a
day
the
liberty
and
equality
which
the
had
attained
after
the
struggle
of
his
ancestors
during
a
thousand
years
you
got
up
the
agitation
you
got
it
up
in
the
church
and
state
you
got
it
up
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
whole
land
let
me
show
you
some
things
you
have
secured
as
the
results
of
your
work
result
of
the
most
consistent
abolitionists
affirming
the
sin
of
slavery
on
the
maxim
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
after
torturing
the
bible
for
a
while
to
make
it
give
the
same
testimony
felt
they
could
get
nothing
from
the
book
they
felt
that
the
god
of
the
bible
disregarded
the
the
boot
and
the
wheel
that
he
would
not
speak
for
them
but
against
them
these
consistent
men
have
now
turned
away
from
the
word
in
despondency
and
are
seeking
somewhere
an
abolition
bible
an
abolition
constitution
for
the
united
states
and
an
abolition
god
this
sir
is
the
of
your
agitation
the
very
van
of
your
attack
repulsed
and
driven
into
infidelity
second
result
of
many
others
and
you
among
them
are
trying
in
exactly
the
same
way
just
mentioned
to
make
the
bible
speak
against
you
get
nothing
by
torturing
the
english
version
people
understand
english
nay
you
get
little
by
applying
the
rack
to
the
hebrew
and
greek
even
before
a
tribunal
of
men
like
you
who
proclaim
beforehand
that
moses
in
hebrew
and
paul
in
greek
condemn
slavery
because
is
a
violation
of
the
first
sentiments
of
the
declaration
of
you
find
it
difficult
to
persuade
men
that
moses
and
paul
were
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
to
sanction
the
philosophy
of
thomas
jefferson
you
find
it
hard
to
make
men
believe
that
moses
saw
in
the
mount
and
paul
had
vision
in
heaven
that
this
future
of
was
inspired
by
jesus
christ
you
torture
very
severely
but
the
muscles
and
bones
of
those
old
men
are
tough
and
strong
they
wo
yield
under
your
terrible
wrenchings
you
get
only
groans
and
mutterings
you
claim
these
voices
i
know
as
testimony
against
slavery
but
you
can
not
torture
in
secret
as
in
olden
times
when
putting
the
question
you
have
to
let
men
be
present
who
tell
us
that
moses
and
paul
wo
speak
for
you
that
they
are
silent
like
christ
before
pilate
or
in
groans
and
mutterings
the
voices
of
their
sorrow
and
the
tones
of
their
indignation
they
rebuke
your
of
the
almighty
when
you
say
if
the
bible
sanctions
slavery
it
neither
ought
to
be
nor
could
be
received
by
mankind
as
a
divine
revelation
this
sir
is
the
you
have
gained
by
your
agitation
you
have
brought
a
thousand
northern
ministers
of
the
gospel
with
yourself
to
the
verge
of
the
same
denial
of
the
word
of
god
which
they
have
made
who
are
only
a
little
ahead
of
you
in
the
road
you
are
travelling
third
result
of
meanwhile
many
of
your
most
pious
men
soundest
scholars
and
sagacious
observers
of
providence
have
been
led
to
study
the
bible
more
faithfully
in
the
light
of
the
times
and
they
are
reading
it
more
and
more
in
harmony
with
the
views
which
have
been
reached
by
the
highest
southern
minds
to
wit
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
sanctioned
by
the
bible
that
it
is
a
relation
belonging
to
the
same
category
as
those
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
master
and
apprentice
master
and
hireling
that
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
ordained
in
eden
for
man
as
and
after
the
while
the
relation
of
slavery
as
a
system
of
labor
is
one
form
of
the
government
ordained
of
god
over
fallen
and
degraded
that
the
in
the
system
are
same
of
oppression
we
see
in
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
and
all
other
forms
of
government
that
slavery
as
a
relation
suited
to
the
more
degraded
or
the
more
ignorant
and
helpless
types
of
a
sunken
humanity
is
like
all
government
intended
the
proof
of
the
curse
of
such
degradation
and
at
the
same
time
to
elevate
and
that
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
being
for
man
as
man
ever
be
over
while
slavery
will
remain
so
long
as
god
sees
it
best
as
a
controlling
power
over
the
ignorant
the
more
degraded
and
helpless
and
that
when
he
sees
it
for
the
good
of
the
country
he
will
cause
it
to
pass
away
if
the
slave
can
be
elevated
to
liberty
and
equality
political
and
social
with
his
master
that
country
or
that
country
if
such
elevation
can
not
be
given
therein
but
may
be
realized
in
some
other
land
all
which
result
must
be
left
to
the
unfoldings
of
the
divine
will
harmony
with
the
and
not
to
a
dispensation
these
facts
are
vindicated
in
the
bible
and
providence
in
the
old
testament
they
stare
you
in
the
face
in
the
family
of
abraham
in
his
slaves
bought
with
his
money
and
born
in
his
house
in
hagar
running
away
under
her
mistress
hard
dealing
with
her
and
yet
sent
back
as
a
fugitive
slave
by
the
angel
in
the
law
which
authorized
the
hebrews
to
hold
their
brethren
as
slaves
for
a
time
in
which
parents
might
sell
their
children
into
bondage
in
which
the
heathen
were
given
to
the
hebrews
as
their
slaves
forever
in
which
slaves
were
considered
so
much
the
money
of
their
master
that
the
master
who
killed
one
by
an
unguarded
blow
was
under
certain
circumstances
sufficiently
punished
in
his
slave
death
because
he
thereby
lost
his
money
in
which
the
difference
between
and
is
by
law
set
forth
in
which
the
runaway
from
heathen
masters
may
not
be
restored
because
god
gave
him
the
benefits
of
an
adopted
hebrew
in
the
new
testament
wherein
the
slavery
of
greece
and
rome
was
recognised
in
the
obligations
laid
on
master
and
slave
in
the
close
connection
of
this
obligation
with
the
duties
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
in
the
obligation
to
return
the
fugitive
slave
to
his
master
and
the
condemnation
of
every
abolition
as
destitute
of
the
truth
tim
vi
this
view
of
slavery
is
becoming
more
and
more
not
only
the
settled
decision
of
the
southern
but
of
the
best
northern
mind
with
a
movement
so
strong
that
you
have
been
startled
by
it
to
write
the
pamphlet
now
lying
before
me
this
is
the
you
have
secured
to
make
many
of
the
best
men
in
the
north
see
the
infidelity
of
your
philosophy
falsely
so
called
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
clearer
and
clearer
light
of
the
scriptures
result
of
the
southern
is
now
satisfied
as
never
before
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
sanctioned
by
the
bible
and
he
feels
as
never
before
the
obligations
of
the
word
of
god
he
no
longer
in
his
ignorance
of
the
scriptures
and
afraid
of
its
teachings
will
seek
to
defend
his
opinions
of
slavery
by
arguments
drawn
from
types
of
mankind
and
other
infidel
theories
but
he
will
look
in
the
light
of
the
bible
on
all
the
good
and
evil
in
the
system
and
when
the
north
as
it
will
shall
regard
him
holding
from
god
this
high
power
for
great
good
when
the
north
shall
no
more
curse
but
bid
him
then
he
will
bless
himself
and
his
slave
in
nobler
benevolence
with
no
false
ideas
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
but
with
the
bible
in
his
heart
and
hand
he
will
do
justice
and
love
mercy
in
higher
and
higher
rule
every
evil
will
be
removed
and
the
negro
will
be
elevated
to
the
highest
attainments
he
can
make
and
be
prepared
for
whatever
destiny
god
intends
this
sir
is
the
of
your
agitation
to
make
the
southern
master
from
the
bible
his
right
to
be
a
master
and
his
duty
to
his
slave
these
are
so
fully
before
you
that
i
think
you
must
see
and
feel
them
you
have
brought
out
besides
tremendous
political
consequences
giving
astonishing
growth
and
spread
to
the
slave
power
on
these
i
can
not
dwell
sir
are
you
satisfied
with
these
consequences
of
the
agitation
you
have
gotten
up
i
am
i
thank
god
that
the
great
deep
of
the
american
mind
has
been
blown
upon
by
the
wind
of
abolitionism
i
rejoice
that
the
stagnant
water
of
that
american
mind
has
been
so
greatly
purified
i
rejoice
that
the
infidelity
and
the
so
long
latent
have
been
set
free
i
rejoice
that
the
sober
sense
north
and
south
so
strangely
asleep
and
silent
has
risen
up
to
hear
the
word
of
god
and
to
speak
it
to
the
land
i
rejoice
that
all
the
south
now
know
that
god
gives
the
right
to
hold
slaves
and
with
that
right
obligations
they
must
fulfil
i
rejoice
that
the
day
has
dawned
in
which
the
north
and
south
will
think
and
feel
and
act
together
on
the
subject
of
slavery
i
thank
god
for
the
agitation
may
he
forgive
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
many
who
have
gotten
it
up
may
he
reveal
more
and
more
that
surely
the
wrath
of
man
shall
praise
him
while
the
remainder
of
wrath
he
will
restrain
of
i
agree
with
you
sir
that
second
of
the
declaration
of
independence
contains
declared
to
be
truths
which
if
truths
do
sustain
you
and
all
abolitionists
in
every
thing
you
say
as
to
the
right
of
the
negro
to
liberty
and
not
only
to
liberty
to
equality
political
and
social
but
i
disagree
with
you
as
to
their
truth
and
i
say
that
not
one
of
said
affirmations
is
a
truth
or
a
truth
at
all
on
the
contrary
that
each
one
is
contrary
to
the
bible
that
each
one
separately
is
denied
and
that
all
five
collectively
are
denied
and
upset
by
the
bible
by
the
natural
history
of
man
and
by
providence
in
every
age
of
the
world
i
say
this
now
in
a
subsequent
communication
i
will
prove
what
i
affirm
for
the
present
i
merely
add
that
the
declaration
of
independence
stands
in
no
need
of
these
false
affirmations
it
was
and
is
a
beautiful
whole
without
them
it
was
and
is
without
these
imaginary
maxims
the
simple
statement
of
the
grievances
the
colonies
had
borne
from
the
and
their
right
when
thus
oppressed
to
declare
themselves
independent
that
is
to
say
the
right
given
of
god
to
oppressed
children
to
seek
protection
in
another
family
or
to
set
up
for
themselves
somewhat
before
or
natural
maturity
right
belonging
to
them
the
british
family
right
sanctioned
of
god
right
blessed
of
god
in
the
resistance
of
the
colonies
not
as
individual
men
to
the
attempt
of
the
to
consummate
her
tyranny
but
god
gives
no
sanction
to
the
affirmation
that
he
has
all
men
that
this
is
and
that
he
has
given
them
rights
that
he
has
made
government
to
its
power
solely
from
their
and
that
he
has
given
them
right
to
change
that
government
in
their
mere
all
this
every
word
of
it
every
jot
and
tittle
is
the
liberty
and
equality
claimed
by
infidelity
god
has
cursed
it
seven
times
in
france
since
and
he
will
curse
it
there
seventy
times
seven
if
frenchmen
prefer
to
be
pestled
so
often
in
solomon
mortar
he
has
cursed
it
in
prussia
austria
germany
italy
spain
he
will
curse
it
as
long
as
time
whether
it
is
affirmed
by
jefferson
paine
robespierre
ledru
rollin
kossuth
greeley
garrison
or
barnes
sir
that
paragraph
is
an
on
the
tree
of
our
liberty
i
pray
you
take
it
away
worship
it
if
you
will
and
in
a
manner
imitate
the
druid
he
gave
reverence
to
the
but
first
he
removed
the
from
the
noble
tree
do
you
the
same
cut
away
with
golden
knife
as
did
the
druid
enshrine
its
imaginary
divinity
in
a
grove
or
cave
then
retire
there
and
leave
our
oak
to
stand
in
its
glory
in
the
light
of
heaven
men
have
been
afraid
to
say
all
this
for
years
just
as
they
have
been
timid
to
assert
that
god
has
placed
master
and
slave
in
the
same
relation
as
husband
and
wife
public
sentiment
which
you
once
had
and
have
lost
suppressed
this
utterance
as
the
other
but
now
men
speak
out
and
i
for
one
will
tell
you
what
the
bible
reveals
as
to
that
part
of
the
declaration
of
independence
as
fearlessly
as
i
tell
you
what
it
says
of
the
system
of
slavery
men
are
made
i
agree
with
you
that
some
men
have
been
are
and
will
be
made
infidels
by
hearing
that
god
has
ordained
slavery
as
one
form
of
his
government
over
depraved
mankind
but
how
does
this
fact
prove
that
the
bible
does
not
sanction
slavery
why
sir
you
have
been
all
your
life
teaching
that
some
men
are
made
infidels
by
hearing
any
truth
of
the
bible
that
some
men
are
made
infidels
by
hearing
the
trinity
depravity
atonement
divinity
of
christ
resurrection
eternal
punishment
true
and
these
men
find
laws
of
their
nature
instinctive
just
such
as
you
find
against
slavery
and
not
more
perverted
in
them
than
in
you
condemning
all
this
bible
and
they
hold
now
with
your
sanction
that
a
book
affirming
such
facts
be
from
sir
some
men
are
made
infidels
by
hearing
the
ten
commandments
and
they
find
laws
of
their
as
strong
in
them
as
yours
in
you
against
slavery
warring
against
every
one
of
these
commandments
and
they
declare
now
with
your
authority
that
a
book
imposing
such
restraints
upon
human
nature
be
from
sir
what
is
it
makes
infidels
you
have
been
wont
to
answer
they
have
god
rule
over
they
have
the
bible
control
the
great
laws
of
their
nature
sir
that
is
the
true
answer
and
you
know
that
great
instinct
of
is
only
one
of
great
needing
special
teaching
and
government
that
is
to
say
instinct
to
rule
the
instinct
to
submit
to
be
ruled
and
the
instinct
for
you
know
too
that
the
instinct
is
the
strongest
the
instinct
is
next
and
that
the
for
is
the
weakest
hence
you
know
the
overwhelming
majority
of
men
have
ever
been
willing
to
be
slaves
masters
have
been
next
in
number
while
the
few
have
struggled
for
freedom
the
bible
then
in
proclaiming
god
will
to
these
three
great
will
be
rejected
by
men
exactly
as
they
have
yielded
forbidden
control
to
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
the
bible
will
make
infidels
of
when
god
calls
to
them
to
rule
right
or
to
give
up
rule
if
they
have
allowed
instinct
of
to
make
them
hate
authority
pharaoh
spoke
for
all
infidel
rulers
when
he
said
is
the
lord
that
i
should
obey
his
voice
the
bible
will
make
infidels
of
when
god
calls
to
them
to
aspire
to
be
free
if
they
have
permitted
instinct
of
submission
make
them
hate
his
commands
the
israelites
in
the
wilderness
revealed
ten
times
in
their
murmuring
in
all
ages
to
god
we
had
died
in
the
wilderness
you
know
all
this
and
you
condemn
these
infidels
good
but
sir
you
know
equally
well
that
the
bible
will
make
infidels
of
men
the
instinct
of
liberty
when
god
calls
them
to
learn
of
him
how
he
gives
and
he
gives
it
and
he
gives
it
if
they
have
so
yielded
to
this
law
of
their
nature
as
to
make
them
despise
the
word
of
the
lord
sir
korah
dathan
and
abiram
spoke
out
just
what
the
men
have
said
in
all
time
moses
and
aaron
take
too
much
upon
you
seeing
all
the
congregation
are
holy
every
one
of
them
wherefore
then
lift
ye
up
yourselves
above
the
congregation
verily
sir
these
men
were
intensely
excited
by
great
law
of
our
nature
the
great
instinct
of
freedom
yea
they
told
god
to
his
face
they
had
looked
within
and
found
the
law
of
liberty
and
equality
the
eternal
right
in
their
intuitional
and
that
they
would
not
submit
to
his
will
in
the
elevation
of
moses
and
aaron
verily
sir
you
in
the
spirit
of
korah
now
proclaim
and
say
ye
masters
and
ye
white
men
who
are
not
masters
north
and
south
ye
take
too
much
upon
you
seeing
the
negro
is
created
your
equal
and
by
unalienable
right
is
as
free
as
you
and
entitled
to
all
your
political
and
social
life
ye
take
then
too
much
upon
you
in
excluding
him
from
your
positions
of
wealth
and
honor
from
your
halls
of
legislation
and
from
your
palace
of
the
nation
and
from
your
splendid
couch
and
from
your
fair
women
with
long
hair
on
that
couch
and
in
that
gilded
chariot
wherefore
then
lift
ye
up
yourselves
above
the
negro
verily
sir
korah
dathan
and
abiram
said
all
we
have
ever
heard
from
or
now
listen
to
from
you
but
the
lord
made
the
earth
swallow
up
korah
dathan
and
abiram
i
agree
with
you
then
sir
fully
that
some
men
have
been
are
and
will
be
made
infidels
by
hearing
that
god
in
the
bible
has
ordained
slavery
but
i
hold
this
to
be
no
argument
against
the
fact
that
the
bible
does
so
teach
because
men
are
made
infidels
by
any
other
doctrine
or
precept
they
hate
to
believe
sir
no
man
has
said
all
this
better
than
you
and
i
can
not
express
my
grief
that
you
in
the
principle
now
avowed
every
man
must
interpret
the
bible
as
he
chooses
to
reason
and
sanction
all
the
infidelity
in
the
world
obliterate
your
on
the
bible
and
deny
the
preaching
of
your
whole
life
so
far
as
god
may
in
his
wrath
permit
you
to
expunge
or
recall
the
words
of
the
wisdom
of
your
better
day
of
general
i
agree
with
you
that
the
presbyterian
church
both
before
and
since
its
division
has
testified
after
a
fashion
against
slavery
but
some
of
its
action
has
been
very
curious
testimony
i
know
not
how
the
resolutions
of
were
gotten
up
nor
how
in
some
assemblies
since
i
can
guess
however
from
what
i
do
know
as
to
how
such
resolutions
passed
in
buffalo
in
and
in
new
york
in
i
know
that
in
buffalo
they
were
at
first
voted
down
by
a
large
majority
then
they
were
reconsidered
in
mere
courtesy
to
men
who
said
they
wanted
to
speak
so
the
resolutions
were
passed
after
some
days
in
which
the
were
applied
and
turned
in
part
female
to
save
the
chairman
of
the
committee
from
of
the
resolutions
being
finally
voted
down
i
know
that
in
new
york
the
decision
of
the
assembly
to
spread
the
minority
report
on
the
minutes
was
considered
in
the
body
and
out
of
it
as
a
southern
victory
for
it
revealed
however
glossed
over
that
many
in
the
house
who
could
not
vote
directly
for
the
minority
report
did
in
fact
prefer
it
to
the
other
i
was
not
in
detroit
in
but
i
think
it
was
established
in
new
york
last
may
that
that
detroit
testimony
was
so
admirably
worded
that
both
southern
and
northern
men
might
vote
for
it
with
clear
consciences
i
need
not
pursue
the
investigation
i
admit
that
after
this
sort
you
have
the
stultified
abstractions
of
the
new
school
presbyterian
church
while
i
have
its
common
sense
you
have
its
delphic
words
i
have
its
actions
you
have
the
traditions
of
the
elders
making
void
the
word
of
god
i
have
the
providence
of
god
restraining
the
church
from
destroying
itself
and
our
social
organization
under
folly
fanaticism
and
infidelity
you
sir
seem
to
acknowledge
this
for
while
you
appear
pleased
with
the
testimony
of
the
new
school
presbyterian
church
such
as
it
is
you
lament
that
the
old
school
have
not
been
true
to
the
resolutions
of
that
in
that
branch
of
the
church
it
is
questionable
whether
those
resolutions
could
now
be
adopted
you
lament
the
silence
of
the
episcopal
the
southern
methodist
and
the
baptist
denominations
you
might
add
the
cumberland
presbyterian
church
and
you
know
that
in
new
england
in
new
york
and
in
the
northwest
many
testify
against
as
a
body
you
lament
that
so
many
members
of
the
church
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
editors
of
religious
papers
defend
the
system
you
lament
that
so
large
a
part
of
the
religious
literature
of
the
land
though
having
its
seat
north
and
sustained
chiefly
by
northern
funds
shows
a
perpetual
deference
to
the
you
lament
that
after
fifty
years
nothing
has
been
done
to
arrest
slavery
you
lament
and
ask
why
should
this
be
so
in
saying
this
you
acknowledge
that
while
you
have
been
laboring
to
get
and
have
reached
the
abstract
testimony
of
the
church
all
diluted
as
it
is
the
fact
has
been
and
is
more
and
more
brought
out
in
the
providence
of
god
that
has
been
and
is
gaining
ground
in
the
united
in
one
word
you
have
contrived
to
get
in
confused
utterance
the
voice
of
the
sanhedrim
while
christ
himself
has
been
preaching
in
the
streets
of
our
jerusalem
the
true
meaning
of
slavery
as
one
form
of
his
government
over
fallen
men
these
then
are
some
of
the
things
i
promised
to
show
as
the
results
of
your
agitation
this
is
the
of
the
past
and
present
speech
of
providence
on
the
subject
of
slavery
you
seem
disturbed
i
feel
sure
things
are
going
on
well
as
to
that
subject
speak
on
then
in
unambiguous
tones
but
sir
when
you
desire
to
go
from
words
to
actions
when
you
intimate
that
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church
may
be
altered
to
permit
such
action
or
that
without
its
alteration
the
church
can
detach
itself
from
slavery
by
its
existing
laws
or
the
modification
of
them
then
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
you
desire
to
deal
in
fact
with
as
then
sir
mean
to
exscind
the
for
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
that
you
suppose
the
south
will
submit
to
such
action
you
mean
then
to
the
south
or
to
exscind
yourself
and
or
to
the
south
to
your
tract
just
published
is
i
suppose
intended
by
you
to
prepare
the
next
general
assembly
for
such
movement
what
then
will
you
make
your
american
presbyterian
and
your
presbyterian
house
effect
that
great
change
in
the
religious
literature
of
the
land
whereby
the
subject
of
shall
be
approached
as
you
deal
with
theft
or
piracy
will
you
then
by
act
of
assembly
synod
presbytery
session
deny
your
pulpits
and
and
wine
to
ministers
elders
and
members
will
you
then
tell
new
england
and
especially
little
rhoda
we
have
purified
our
skirts
from
the
blood
forgive
us
and
take
us
again
to
your
love
what
then
will
you
then
ostracize
the
south
and
compel
the
abolition
of
slavery
sir
do
you
bid
us
fear
these
coming
events
thus
casting
their
shadow
before
from
the
leaves
of
your
book
sir
you
may
destroy
the
integrity
of
the
new
school
presbyterian
church
so
much
evil
you
may
do
but
you
will
hereby
only
add
immensely
to
the
great
power
and
good
of
the
old
school
and
you
will
make
disclosures
of
providence
unfolding

consummation
of
things
very
different
from
the
end
you
wish
to
accomplish
for
your
country
and
the

this
letter
is
the
examination
and
refutation
of
the
infidel
theory
of
human
government
foisted
into
the
declaration
of
independence
i
had
written
this
criticism
in
different
form
for
publication
before
barnes
had
appeared
i
wrote
it
to
vindicate
my
affirmation
in
the
general
assembly
which
met
in
new
york
may
last
on
this
part
of
the
declaration
my
views
were
maturely
formed
after
years
of
reflection
and
weeks
nay
months
of
writing
and
thus
these
truths
from
the
bible
providence
and
common
sense
were
like
rich
freight
in
goodly
ship
waiting
for
the
wind
to
sail
when
lo
barnes
filled
the
canvas
and
carried
it
out
of
port
into
the
wide
the
free
the
open
sea
of
american
public
thought
there
it
sails
if
pirate
or
other
hostile
craft
comes
alongside
the
good
ship
has
guns
i
ask
that
this
paper
be
carefully
read
more
than
once
twice
or
three
times
barnes
i
presume
will
not
so
read
it
he
is
committed
greeley
may
notice
it
with
his
sparkling
wit
albeit
he
has
too
much
sense
to
grapple
with
its
argument
the
will
say
of
it
what
he
would
say
if
christ
were
casting
out
devils
in
new
york
he
casteth
out
devils
through
beelzebub
the
chief
of
the
devils
yea
this
says
that
my
version
of
the
golden
rule
is
diabolical
when
truly
that
version
is
the
of
the
spirit
as
christ
casting
out
devils
was
the
of
the
holy
ghost
gerrett
smith
garrison
giddings
do
already
agree
with
me
that
they
are
right
if
jefferson
spoke
the
truth
yea
whether
the
bible
be
true
is
no
question
with
them
no
more
than
with
him
yea
they
hold
as
he
did
that
whether
there
be
one
god
or
twenty
it
matters
not
the
fact
either
way
in
men
minds
neither
breaks
the
leg
nor
picks
the
pocket
see
jefferson
notes
on
virginia
beecher
and
cheever
will
find
nothing
in
me
to
aid
them
in
speaking
to
the
mobs
of
ephesus
and
antioch
they
are
making
shrines

diana
stowe
is
on

of
vanity
of
which
she
is
the
queen
none
of
these
will
read
with
attention
or
honesty
if
at
all
this
examination
of
what
randolph
long
ago
said
was
a
of
these
are
all
wiser
than
seven
men
that
can
render
a
reason
but
there
are
thousands
north
and
south
who
will
read
this
refutation
and
will
feel
and
acknowledge
that
in
the
light
of
god
truth
the
notion
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
is
falsehood
and
infidelity
rev
barnes
dear
sir
in
my
first
letter
i
promised
to
prove
that
the
paragraph
in
the
declaration
of
independence
which
contains
the
affirmation
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
rights
has
no
sanction
from
the
word
of
god
i
now
meet
my
obligation
the
time
has
come
when
civil
liberty
as
revealed
in
the
bible
and
in
providence
must
be
understood
and
defended
against
infidel
theories
of
human
rights
the
slavery
question
has
brought
on
this
conflict
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
south
the
land
of
the
slave
is
summoned
by
god
to
defend
the
liberty
he
gives
while
the
north
the
clime
of
the
free
misunderstands
and
changes
the
truth
of
god
into
a
lie
claiming
a
liberty
he
does
not
give
wherefore
is
this
i
reply
god
when
he
ordained
government
over
men
gave
to
the
individual
man
rights
as
he
is
under
government
he
first
established
the
family
hence
all
other
rule
is
merely
the
family
expanded
the
of
the
family
limited
the
of
every
member
god
required
the
family
and
then
the
state
so
to
rule
as
to
give
to
every
member
the
which
is
his
in
harmony
with
the
welfare
of
the
whole
and
he
commanded
the
individual
to
seek
and
no
more
now
mankind
being
depraved
government
has
ever
violated
its
obligation
to
rule
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
community
and
has
wielded
its
power
in
oppression
consequently
the
governed
have
ever
struggled
to
secure
the
good
which
was
their
right
but
in
this
struggle
they
have
ever
been
tempted
to
go
beyond
the
limitation
god
had
made
and
to
seek
supposed
good
not
given
in
rights
prompted
by
destructive
of
the
state
government
thus
ever
existing
in
oppression
and
people
thus
ever
rising
up
against
despotism
have
been
the
history
of
mankind
the
reformation
was
one
of
the
many
convulsions
in
this
conflict
in
its
first
movements
men
claimed
the
liberty
the
bible
grants
soon
they
ran
into
licentiousness
god
then
stayed
the
further
progress
of
emancipation
in
europe
because
the
spread
of
the
asserted
liberty
would
have
made
infidelity
prevail
over
that
part
of
the
continent
where
the
reformation
was
arrested
god
preferred
romanism
and
other
despotisms
modified
as
they
were
by
the
struggle
to
rule
for
a
time
than
have
those
countries
destroyed
under
the
sway
of
a
licentious
freedom
in
this
contest
the
north
american
colonies
had
their
rise
and
they
continued
the
strife
with
england
until
they
declared
themselves
independent
that
declaration
affirmed
not
only
the
liberty
sanctioned
of
the
bible
but
also
the
liberty
constituting
infidelity
its
first
paragraph
to
the
word
is
a
noble
introduction
omit
then
what
follows
to
the
sentence
beginning
will
and
the
paper
thus
expurgated
is
complete
and
is
then
simply
the
complaint
of
the
colonies
against
the
government
of
england
which
had
oppressed
them
beyond
further
submission
and
the
assertion
of
their
right
to
be
free
and
independent
states
this
declaration
was
in
that
form
nothing
more
than
the
affirmation
of
the
right
god
gives
to
children
in
a
family
applied
to
the
colonies
in
regard
to
their
that
is
to
say
children
have
from
god
right
as
children
when
cruelly
treated
to
secure
the
good
to
which
they
are
entitled
as
children
in
the
family
they
may
secure
good
by
becoming
part
of
another
family
or
by
setting
up
for
themselves
if
old
enough
so
the
colonies
had
from
god
as
colonies
when
oppressed
beyond
endurance
to
exchange
the
british
family
for
another
or
if
of
sufficient
age
to
establish
their
own
household
the
declaration
then
in
that
complaint
of
oppression
and
affirmation
of
right
in
the
colonies
to
be
independent
asserts
liberty
sanctioned
by
the
word
of
god
and
therefore
the
pledge
to
declaration
of
lives
fortune
and
sacred
honor
was
blessed
of
heaven
in
the
triumph
of
their
cause
but
the
declaration
in
the
part
i
have
omitted
affirms
other
things
and
very
different
it
asserts
facts
and
rights
as
appertaining
to
man
not
in
the
scriptures
but
contrary
thereto
here
is
the
passage
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
to
secure
these
rights
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
and
to
institute
a
new
government
laying
its
foundation
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
is
the
affirmation
of
the
liberty
claimed
by
it
teaches
as
a
fact
which
is
not
true
and
it
claims
as
right
which
god
has
not
given
it
asserts
nothing
new
however
it
lays
claim
to
that
individual
right
beyond
the
limitation
god
has
put
which
man
has
ever
asserted
when
in
his
struggle
for
liberty
he
has
refused
to
be
guided
and
controlled
by
the
word
and
providence
of
his
creator
the
paragraph
is
a
chain
of
four
links
each
of
which
is
claimed
to
be
a
truth
the
and
controlling
assertion
is
that
all
men
are
created
equal
which
proposition
as
i
understand
it
is
that
man
and
woman
on
earth
is
created
with
equal
attributes
of
body
and
and
consequently
that
every
individual
has
by
virtue
of
his
or
her
being
created
the
equal
of
each
and
every
other
individual
the
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
in
his
or
her
own
keeping
that
that
right
is
unalienable
without
his
or
her
it
follows
that
government
among
men
must
derive
its
just
powers
only
from
the
of
the
governed
and
as
the
governed
are
the
aggregate
of
individuals
each
person
must
consent
to
be
thus
controlled
before
he
or
she
can
be
rightfully
under
such
and
finally
that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
the
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
each
such
individual
man
or
woman
may
then
each
such
person
may
rightly
set
to
work
to
alter
or
abolish
such
form
and
institute
a
new
government
on
such
principles
and
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
this
is
the
celebrated
averment
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
to
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
with
the
necessary
consequences
i
have
fairly
expanded
its
meaning
it
is
the
old
infidel
averment
it
is
not
true
in
any
one
of
its
assertions
men
not
created
it
is
not
a
truth
that
all
men
are
created
equal
webster
in
his
dictionary
defines
evident
without
proof
or
reason
clear
conviction
upon
a
bare
presentation
to
the
mind
as
that
two
and
three
make
five
now
i
affirm
and
you
i
think
will
not
contradict
me
that
the
position
men
are
created
equal
is
that
the
nature
of
the
case
makes
it
impossible
for
it
to
be
for
the
created
nature
of
man
is
not
in
the
class
of
things
of
which
such
propositions
can
by
possibility
be
predicated
it
is
equally
clear
and
beyond
debate
that
it
is
not
that
all
men
have
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
of
the
governed
and
may
be
altered
or
abolished
whenever
such
rights
may
be
better
secured
all
these
assertions
can
be
known
to
be
true
or
false
only
from
revelation
of
the
creator
or
from
examination
and
induction
of
reasoning
covering
the
nature
and
the
obligations
of
the
race
on
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
what
revelation
and
examination
of
facts
do
teach
i
will
now
show
the
whole
as
to
the
truth
of
this
series
of
averments
is
on
the
first
affirmation
all
men
are
created
or
to
keep
up
my
first
figure
the
strength
of
the
chain
of
asserted
truths
depend
on
first
link
it
must
then
stand
the
following
perfect
trial
god
reveals
to
us
that
he
created
man
in
his
image
a
spirit
endowed
with
attributes
resembling
his
own
to
reason
to
form
rule
of
right
to
manifest
various
emotions
to
will
to
act
and
that
he
gave
him
a
body
suited
to
such
a
spirit
i
that
he
created
man
and
i
that
he
made
the
woman
of
the
ii
that
he
made
man
the
image
and
glory
of
but
the
woman
glory
of
the
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman
but
the
woman
of
the
man
neither
was
the
man
for
the
but
the
woman
the
cor
xi
that
he
made
the
woman
to
be
the
weaker
vessel
pet
iii
here
then
god
created
to
be
in
the
beginning
two
a
male
and
a
female
man
one
of
them
to
the
other
attributes
of
body
and
and
as
we
shall
see
presently
not
equal
in
rights
as
to
government
observe
this
inequality
was
fact
as
to
the
two
in
the
perfect
state
wherein
they
were
but
these
two
fell
from
that
perfect
state
became
depraved
and
began
to
be
degraded
in
body
and
mind
this
statement
of
the
original
inequality
in
which
man
was
created
controls
all
that
comes
after
in
god
providence
and
in
the
natural
history
of
the
race
in
its
comprehensive
teaching
says
that
god
soon
after
the
flood
subjected
the
races
to
all
the
influences
of
the
different
zones
of
the
earth
that
he
hath
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
hath
determined
the
times
before
appointed
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation
that
they
should
seek
the
lord
if
haply
they
might
feel
after
him
and
find
him
though
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
acts
xvii
these
bounds
of
their
habitation
have
had
much
to
do
in
the
natural
history
of
man
for
have
been
or
more
correctly
since
the
race
was
created
once
only
at
the
first
with
attributes
of
body
and
mind
derived
from
the
two
unequal
parents
and
these
attributes
in
every
individual
the
combined
result
of
the
parental
natures
then
come
into
the
world
under
influences
upon
the
amalgamated
and
transmitted
body
and
mind
from
depravity
and
degradation
sent
down
during
all
the
generations
past
and
therefore
under
causes
of
inequality
acting
on
each
individual
from
climate
from
scenery
from
food
from
health
from
sickness
from
love
from
hatred
from
government
inconceivable
in
variety
and
power
under
such
causes
to
produce
infinite
shades
of
inequality
physical
and
mental
in
birth
if
all
men
were
created
equal
born
equal
in
attributes
of
body
and
mind
such
creation
would
be
a
violation
of
all
the
known
analogies
in
the
world
of
life
do
then
the
facts
in
man
natural
history
exhibit
this
departure
from
the
laws
of
life
and
spirit
do
they
prove
that
all
men
are
created
equal
do
they
show
that
every
man
and
every
woman
of
africa
asia
europe
america
and
the
islands
of
the
seas
is
created
each
one
equal
in
body
and
mind
to
each
other
man
or
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
this
has
always
been
need
i
extend
these
questions
methinks
sir
i
hear
you
say
what
others
have
told
me
that
the
declaration
is
not
to
be
understood
as
affirming
what
is
so
clearly
false
but
merely
asserts
that
all
men
are
created
equal
in
i
reply
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
clause
before
us
for
is
the
meaning
of
the
next
sentence
the
in
the
series
we
are
considering
there
are
as
i
have
said
four
links
to
the
chain
of
thought
in
this
passage
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
the
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
government
derives
its
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
the
people
may
alter
and
abolish
it
these
links
are
logical
sequences
all
men
man
and
woman
are
created
equal
equal
in
of
body
and
for
is
the
only
sense
in
which
they
could
be
equal
they
are
endowed
with
right
to
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
unalienable
except
in
their
consent
such
consent
is
essential
to
all
rightful
government
and
and
the
people
have
supreme
right
to
alter
or
abolish
it
the
meaning
then
i
give
to
that
first
link
and
to
the
chain
following
the
sense
because
if
you
deny
that
meaning
to
the
then
the
others
have
no
logical
truth
whatever
thus
if
all
men
are
created
equal
in
attributes
of
body
and
mind
then
the
may
be
that
such
men
can
not
be
endowed
with
right
to
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
unalienable
save
in
their
then
government
over
such
men
can
not
rightfully
rest
upon
their
nor
can
they
have
right
to
alter
or
abolish
government
in
their
mere
determination
yea
sir
you
concede
every
thing
if
you
admit
that
the
declaration
does
mean
to
affirm
that
all
men
are
in
body
and
i
will
suppose
in
the
alps
a
community
of
cretins
deformed
and
helpless
idiots
but
among
them
many
from
the
same
parents
who
in
body
and
mind
by
birth
are
comparatively
now
this
physical
and
mental
by
birth
makes
it
impossible
that
the
government
over
these
cretins
can
be
in
their
napoleons
must
the
napoleons
must
absolutely
control
their
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
for
the
good
of
the
community
do
you
reply
that
i
have
taken
an
extreme
case
that
everybody
admits
sensible
people
must
govern
natural
fools
ay
sir
there
is
the
rub
are
some
men
then
natural
fools
very
well
then
you
also
admit
that
some
men
are
just
a
degree
above
natural
fools
and
consequently
that
men
are
in
all
degrees
gradually
rising
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
are
they
not
just
above
the
brute
with
savage
natures
along
with
mental
imbecility
and
physical
degradation
must
the
napoleons
govern
the
cretins
without
their
consent
must
they
not
also
govern
without
their
consent
these
types
of
mankind
whether
one
two
three
thirty
or
three
hundred
degrees
above
the
cretins
if
they
are
still
greatly
inferior
by
nature
suppose
the
cretins
removed
from
the
imagined
community
and
a
colony
of
australian
or
california
be
in
their
stead
must
not
the
napoleons
govern
these
and
if
you
admit
inequality
to
be
in
birth
then
that
inequality
is
the
very
ground
of
the
reason
why
the
napoleons
must
govern
the
and
remove
these
and
put
in
their
place
an
importation
of
african
negroes
do
you
admit
inferiority
creation
then
the
same
control
over
them
must
be
the
irresistible
fact
in
common
sense
and
scripture
of
god
napoleons
must
they
must
govern
without
asking
consent
if
the
inequality
be
such
that
would
be
evil
and
not
good
in
the
family
the
state
yea
sir
if
you
deny
that
the
declaration
asserts
all
men
are
created
equal
in
body
and
mind
then
you
admit
the
inequality
may
be
such
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
in
such
cases
men
have
rights
unalienable
save
in
their
consent
and
you
admit
it
to
be
impossible
that
government
in
such
circumstances
can
exist
in
such
but
if
you
affirm
the
declaration
mean
that
men
are
equal
in
attributes
of
body
and
mind
then
you
hold
to
an
equality
which
god
in
his
word
and
providence
and
the
natural
history
of
man
denies
to
be
truth
i
think
i
have
fairly
shown
from
scripture
and
facts
that
the
first
averment
is
not
the
truth
and
have
reduced
it
to
an
absurdity
i
will
now
regard
the
second
third
and
fourth
links
of
the
chain
i
know
they
are
already
broken
for
the
whole
chain
being
but
an
electric
current
from
a
vicious
imagination
i
have
destroyed
the
whole
by
breaking
the
first
link
or
was
it
but
a
cluster
from
a
poisonous
vine
then
i
have
killed
the
branches
by
cutting
the
vine
i
will
however
expose
the
other
three
sequences
by
a
distinct
argument
covering
them
all
delegated
to
god
gave
to
adam
sovereignty
over
the
human
race
in
his
first
decree
shall
rule
over
was
the
institution
of
government
it
was
not
based
on
the
of
eve
the
governed
it
was
from
god
he
gave
to
adam
like
authority
to
rule
his
children
it
was
not
derived
from
their
it
was
from
god
he
gave
noah
the
same
sovereignty
with
express
power
over
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
it
was
not
founded
in
of
shem
ham
and
japheth
and
their
wives
it
was
from
god
he
then
determined
the
habitations
of
men
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
to
them
in
every
clime
the
and
of
their
governments
he
gave
directly
government
to
israel
he
just
as
truly
gave
it
to
idumea
to
egypt
and
to
babylon
to
the
arab
to
the
esquimaux
the
caffre
the
hottentot
and
the
negro
god
in
the
bible
decides
the
matter
he
says
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
they
that
resist
shall
receive
to
themselves
damnation
for
rulers
are
not
a
terror
to
good
works
but
to
the
evil
wilt
thou
then
not
be
afraid
of
the
power
do
that
which
is
good
and
thou
shalt
have
praise
of
the
same
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
to
thee
for
good
but
if
thou
do
that
which
is
evil
be
afraid
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
a
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil
wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject
not
only
for
wrath
but
also
for
conscience
sake
for
this
cause
pay
ye
tribute
also
for
they
are

very
thing

xiii
here
god
reveals
to
us
that
he
has
to
government
his
right
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
and
that
that
right
is
not
in
any
sense
from
the
of
the
governed
but
is
directly
from
him
government
over
men
whether
in
the
family
or
in
the
state
is
then
as
directly
from
god
as
it
would
be
if
he
in
visible
person
ruled
in
the
family
or
in
the
state
i
speak
not
only
of
the
right
simply
to
govern
but
the
of
the
government
and
the
of
the
power
government
all
which
god
do
that
more
no
and
it
is
to
do
that
more
no
government
is
responsible
to
god
if
it
fails
to
do
that
which
he
himself
would
do
it
is
under
responsibility
then
to
rule
in
righteousness
it
must
not
oppress
it
must
to
every
individual
liberty
and
pursuit
of
in
harmony
with
the
of
the
family
the
state
god
himself
would
give
that
more
no
this
passage
of
scripture
settles
the
question
from
whence
has
government
right
to
rule
and
what
is
the
of
its
power
the
right
is
from
god
and
the
extent
of
the
power
is
that
to
which
god
would
exercise
it
if
he
were
personally
on
the
earth
god
in
this
passage
and
others
settles
with
equal
clearness
from
whence
is
the
obligation
to
to
government
and
what
is
the
of
the
duty
of
obedience
the
obligation
to
submit
is
not
from
individual
right
to
consent
or
not
to
consent
to
government
but
the
obligation
is
directly
from
god
the
extent
of
the
duty
of
obedience
is
equally
revealed
in
this
wise
so
long
as
the
government
rules
in
righteousness
the
duty
is
perfect
obedience
so
soon
however
as
government
requires
which
god
in
his
word
the
subject
to
he
must
obey
god
and
not
man
he
must
refuse
to
obey
man
but
inasmuch
as
the
obligation
to
submit
to
authority
of
government
is
so
great
the
subject
must
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
he
shall
refuse
to
obey
before
he
assumes
the
responsibility
of
resistance
to
the
powers
that
be
his
will
not
justify
him
before
god
if
he
mistakes
his
duty
may
be
all
the
more
to
blame
for
such
a
conscience
let
him
then
be
certain
he
can
say
like
peter
and
john
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
but
when
government
requires
which
god
not
the
subject
to
do
although
the
government
may
have
transcended
the
line
of
its
righteous
rule
the
subject
must
nevertheless
submit
oppression
has
gone
to
at
which
resistance
be
and
is
when
resistance
will
clearly
be
of
evil
and
more
of
to
the
community
than
further
submission
is
the
rule
of
god
gives
to
the
people
or
to
the
or
to
the
to
guide
them
in
resistance
to
the
powers
that
be
it
is
irresistibly
that
who
government
alone
the
right
to
alter
or
abolish
that
he
who
institutes
the
powers
that
be
has
alone
the
right
to
say
when
and
how
the
people
in
whole
or
in
part
may
resist
so
then
the
people
in
whole
or
in
part
have
no
right
to
resist
to
alter
or
abolish
government
simply
because
may
deem
it
destructive
of
the
end
for
which
it
was
instituted
but
they
may
resist
alter
or
abolish
it
shall
be
seen
that
god
so
regards
this
places
the
great
fact
where
it
must
be
placed
control
bible
providence
i
will
conclude
with
one
or
two
illustrations
god
in
his
providence
ordains
the
russian
form
of
government
he
places
the
sovereignty
in
one
man
because
he
sees
that
such
government
can
secure
for
a
time
more
good
to
that
degraded
people
than
any
other
form
now
i
ask
has
the
emperor
from
god
to
change
at
once
in
his
mere
the
of
his
government
to
of
the
united
states
no
god
forbids
him
why
because
he
would
thereby
destroy
the
good
and
bring
immense
evil
in
his
empire
i
ask
again
have
the
russian
serfs
and
nobles
yea
all
consenting
the
right
from
god
to
make
that
change
no
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
not
suited
to
them
and
in
such
an
attempt
they
would
deprive
themselves
of
the
blessings
they
now
have
and
bring
all
the
horrors
of
anarchy
do
you
ask
if
i
then
hold
that
god
ordains
the
russian
type
of
rule
to
be
perpetual
over
that
people
no
the
emperor
is
bound
to
secure
all
of
liberty
and
pursuit
of
to
each
individual
consistent
with
the
good
of
the
nation
and
he
is
to
learn
his
obligation
from
the
bible
and
faithfully
apply
it
to
the
condition
of
his
subjects
will
thus
gradually
elevate
while
they
on
their
part
are
bound
to
strive
for
this
elevation
in
all
the
ways
in
which
god
may
show
them
the
good
and
the
right
which
more
and
more
will
belong
to
them
in
their
upward
progress
the
result
of
such
government
and
such
obedience
would
be
that
of
a
father
faithful
training
and
corresponding
obedience
the
russian
people
would
thus
have
gradually
that
measure
of
liberty
they
could
bear
under
the
power
and
then
in
other
forms
as
they
might
be
qualified
to
realize
them
this
development
would
be
without
convulsion
as
the
parent
gives
place
while
the
children
are
passing
from
the
lower
to
their
higher
life
it
would
be
the
exemplification
of
carlyle
illustration
of
the
snake
he
says
a
people
should
change
their
government
only
as
a
snake
sheds
his
skin
the
new
skin
is
gradually
formed
under
the
old
one
and
then
the
snake
wriggles
out
with
just
a
drop
of
blood
here
and
there
where
the
old
jacket
held
on
rather
tightly
god
ordains
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
in
the
of
the
majority
because
he
has
trained
the
people
through
many
generations
in
modes
of
government
to
such
an
elevation
in
moral
and
religious
intelligence
that
such
sovereignty
is
best
suited
to
confer
on
them
the
highest
right
as
yet
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
but
god
requires
that
will
of
the
be
in
perfect
submission
to
him
once
more
then
i
inquire
whether
the
people
of
this
country
yea
all
of
them
consenting
have
right
from
god
to
abolish
now
at
this
time
our
free
institutions
and
set
up
the
sway
of
russia
no
but
why
there
is
one
answer
only
he
tells
us
that
our
happiness
is
in
this
form
of
government
and
in
it
its
developed
results
social
compact
not
recognised
in
the
divine
here
i
pause
so
then
god
gives
no
sanction
to
the
notion
of
a
social
compact
he
never
gave
to
man
individual
isolated
natural
rights
unalienably
in
his
keeping
he
never
made
him
a
caspar
hauser
in
the
forest
without
name
or
home
a
melchisedek
in
the
wilderness
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
a
robinson
crusoe
on
his
island
in
skins
and
barefooted
waiting
among
goats
and
parrots
the
coming
of
the
canoes
and
the
savages
to
enable
him
to
if
he
would
to
the
relations
of
social
life
and
therefore
those
five
sentences
in
that
second
paragraph
of
the
declaration
of
independence
are
not
the
truth
so
then
it
is
not
truth
that
all
men
are
created
equal
so
then
it
is
not
the
truth
in
fact
that
they
are
created
equal
so
then
it
is
not
the
truth
that
god
has
endowed
all
men
with
unalienable
right
to
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
so
then
it
is
not
the
truth
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
so
then
it
is
not
the
truth
that
the
people
have
right
to
alter
or
abolish
their
government
and
institute
a
new
form
whenever
to
them
it
shall
seem
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
the
manner
in
which
these
unscriptural
dogmas
have
been
modified
or
developed
in
the
united
states
i
will
examine
in
another
paper
i
merely
add
that
the
opinions
of
revered
ancestors
on
these
questions
of
right
and
their
application
to
american
slavery
must
now
as
never
before
be
brought
to
the
test
of
the
light
of
the
bible
ross
huntsville
this
argument
on
the
abolition
charge
against
the
that
he
is
a
covers
the
whole
question
of
slavery
especially
as
it
is
seen
in
the
old
testament
the
headings
in
the
letter
make
the
subject
sufficiently
clear
no
iii
rev
albert
barnes
dear
sir
in
my
first
letter
i
merely
touched
some
points
in
your
tract
intending
to
notice
them
more
fully
in
subsequent
communications
i
have
in
my
second
paper
sufficiently
examined
the
imaginary
maxims
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
rights
in
this
i
will
test
your
views
by
scripture
more
directly
to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word
it
is
because
there
is
no
light
in
them
isaiah
viii
the
abolitionist
charges
the
with
being
a
he
makes
this
allegation
in
two
affirmations
first
that
the
is
thus
guilty
because
the
negro
having
been
kidnapped
in
africa
therefore
those
who
now
hold
him
or
his
children
in
bondage
lie
under
the
guilt
of
that
first
act
secondly
that
the
by
the
very
fact
that
he
is
such
is
guilty
of
stealing
from
the
negro
his
unalienable
right
to
freedom
this
is
the
charge
it
covers
the
whole
subject
i
will
meet
it
in
all
its
parts
difference
between
and
as
set
forth
in
the
the
bible
reads
thus
exodus
xxi
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
what
then
is
it
to
kidnap
or
steal
a
man
webster
informs
us
to
kidnap
is
to
steal
a
human
being
a
man
woman
or
child
or
to
seize
and
forcibly
carry
away
any
person
whatever
from
his
own
country
or
state
into
another
the
idea
of
and
forcibly
carrying
away
enters
into
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
all
the
definitions
of
law
the
crime
then
set
forth
in
the
bible
was
not
a
man
but
selling
a
man
the
crime
was
not
having
a
man
his
hand
as
a
but
in
hand
as
a
slave
a
man
and
hence
the
penalty
of
was
affixed
not
to
selling
buying
or
holding
man
as
a
slave
but
to
the
specific
offence
of
and
selling
or
a
man
stolen
contrary
to
this
yea
it
was
and
this
law
which
made
it
for
under
some
circumstances
god
sanctioned
the
seizing
and
forcibly
carrying
away
a
man
woman
or
child
from
country
or
state
into
slavery
or
other
condition
he
sanctioned
the
utter
destruction
of
every
male
and
every
married
woman
and
child
of
and
the
seizure
and
forcibly
carrying
away
four
hundred
virgins
unto
the
camp
to
shiloh
and
there
being
given
as
wives
to
the
remnant
of
the
slaughtered
tribe
of
benjamin
in
the
rock
rimmon
sir
how
did
that
destruction
of
and
the
kidnapping
of
those
young
women
differ
from
the
razing
of
an
african
village
and
forcibly
seizing
and
carrying
away
those
not
put
to
the
sword
the
difference
is
in
this
god
commanded
the
israelites
to
seize
and
bear
off
those
young
women
but
he
forbids
the
slaver
to
kidnap
the
african
therefore
the
israelites
did
right
therefore
the
trader
does
wrong
the
israelites
it
seems
gave
wives
in
that
way
to
the
spared
benjamites
because
they
had
sworn
not
to
give
their
daughters
but
there
were
six
hundred
of
these
benjamites
two
hundred
were
therefore
still
without
wives
what
was
done
for
them
why
god
authorized
the
elders
of
the
congregation
to
tell
the
two
hundred
benjamites
to
catch
every
man
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
shiloh
when
they
came
out
to
dance
in
the
feast
of
the
lord
on
the
north
side
of
bethel
and
the
children
of
benjamin
did
so
and
took
them
wives
whom
they
caught
judges
xxi
god
made
it
right
for
those
benjamites
to
catch
every
man
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
shiloh
but
he
makes
it
wrong
for
the
trader
to
catch
his
slaves
of
the
sons
or
daughters
of
africa
lest
you
should
try
to
deny
that
god
authorized
this
act
of
the
children
of
israel
although
i
believe
he
did
order
it
let
me
remind
you
of
another
such
case
the
authority
for
which
you
will
not
question
moses
by
direct
command
from
god
destroyed
the
midianites
he
slew
all
the
males
and
carried
away
all
the
women
and
children
he
then
had
all
the
married
women
and
male
children
killed
but
all
the
virgins
thousand
were
divided
as
spoil
among
the
people
and
of
these
virgins
lord
were
given
unto
eleazar
the
priest
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
numbers
xxxi
sir
thomas
paine
rejected
the
bible
on
this
fact
among
his
other
objections
yea
reason
sensibilities
great
law
of
humanity
intuitional
and
eternal
sense
of
right
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
honor
such
a
god
and
sir
on
your
now
avowed
principles
of
interpretation
which
are
those
of
paine
you
sustain
him
in
his
rejection
of
the
books
of
moses
and
all
the
word
of
god
god
command
it
for
moses
to
destroy
the
midianites
and
make
slaves
of
their
daughters
and
i
have
dwelt
upon
these
facts
to
reiterate
what
i
hold
to
be
the
first
truth
in
morals
that
a
thing
is
right
not
because
it
is
ever
so
but
because
god
it
and
of
course
a
thing
is
wrong
not
because
it
is
so
in
the
nature
of
things
but
because
god
makes
it
wrong
i
distinctly
have
taken
and
do
take
that
ground
in
its
widest
sense
and
am
prepared
to
maintain
it
against
all
comers
he
made
it
right
for
the
sons
of
adam
to
marry
their
sisters
he
made
it
right
for
abraham
to
marry
his
he
made
it
right
for
the
patriarchs
and
david
and
solomon
to
have
more
wives
than
one
he
made
it
right
when
he
gave
command
to
kill
whole
nations
sparing
none
he
made
it
right
when
he
ordered
that
nations
or
such
part
as
he
pleased
should
be
spared
and
enslaved
he
made
it
right
that
the
patriarchs
and
the
israelites
should
hold
slaves
in
harmony
with
the
system
of
servile
labor
which
had
long
been
in
the
world
he
merely
modified
that
system
to
suit
his
views
of
good
among
his
people
so
then
when
he
saw
fit
they
might
capture
men
so
then
when
he
forbade
the
individual
israelite
to
steal
a
man
he
made
it
crime
and
the
penalty
death
so
then
that
crime
was
not
the
mere
a
man
nor
the
a
man
nor
the
a
man
but
the
and
or
a
man
circumstances
thus
forbidden
of
the
israelite
master
a
i
now
ask
did
god
intend
to
make
and
the
same
thing
let
us
see
in
that
very
chapter
of
exodus
xxi
which
contains
the
law
against
and
only
four
verses
further
on
god
says
if
a
man
smite
his
servant
or
his
maid
with
a
rod
and
he
die
under
his
hand
he
shall
be
surely
punished
notwithstanding
if
he
continue
a
day
or
two
he
shall
not
be
punished
for
he
is
his
money
verses
sir
that
man
was
not
a
hired
servant
he
was
bought
with
money
he
was
regarded
by
god
the
of
his
master
he
was
his
slave
in
the
full
meaning
of
a
slave
then
and
now
bought
with
money
god
then
did
not
intend
the
israelites
to
understand
and
not
one
of
them
ever
understood
from
that
day
to
this
that
jehovah
in
his
law
to
moses
regarded
the
as
a
was
a
specific
offence
with
its
specific
penalty
was
one
form
of
righteous
government
over
men
a
government
he
ordained
with
various
modifications
among
the
hebrews
themselves
and
with
sterner
features
in
its
relation
to
heathen
slaves
in
exodus
xxi
and
leviticus
various
gradations
of
servitude
were
enacted
with
a
careful
particularity
which
need
not
be
misunderstood
among
these
a
hebrew
man
might
be
a
slave
for
six
years
and
then
go
free
with
his
wife
if
he
were
married
when
he
came
into
the
relation
but
if
his
master
had
given
him
a
wife
and
she
had
borne
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
should
be
her
master
and
he
should
go
out
by
himself
that
is
the
man
by
the
law
became
free
while
his
wife
and
children
remained
slaves
if
the
servant
however
plainly
said
i
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
children
i
will
not
go
out
free
then
his
master
brought
him
unto
the
judges
also
unto
the
doorpost
and
his
master
bored
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
served
him
forever
ex
xxi
sir
you
have
urged
discussion
give
us
then
your
views
of
that
passage
tell
us
how
that
man
was
separated
from
his
wife
and
children
according
to
eternal
tell
us
what
was
the
condition
of
the
woman
in
case
the
man
chose
to
go
out
without
her
tell
us
if
the
hebrew
who
thus
had
his
ear
bored
by
his
master
with
an
awl
was
not
a
slave
for
life
tell
us
lastly
whether
those
children
were
not
slaves
and
while
on
that
chapter
tell
us
whether
in
the
next
verses
god
did
not
allow
the
israelite
father
to
sell
his
own
daughter
into
bondage
and
into
polygamy
by
the
same
act
of
sale
i
will
not
dwell
longer
on
these
milder
forms
of
slavery
but
read
to
you
the
clear
and
unmistakable
command
of
the
lord
in
leviticus
xxv
both
thy
bondmen
and
thy
bondmaids
which
thou
shalt
have
shall
be
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
bondmen
and
bondmaids
moreover
of
the
children
of
the
strangers
that
do
sojourn
among
you
of
them
shall
ye
buy
and
of
their
families
that
are
with
you
which
they
beget
in
your
land
and
they
shall
be
your
possession
and
ye
shall
take
them
for
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
and
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
forever
sir
the
sun
will
grow
dim
with
age
before
that
scripture
can
be
tortured
to
mean
any
thing
else
than
just
what
it
says
that
god
commanded
the
israelites
to
be
in
the
strict
and
true
sense
over
the
heathen
in
manner
and
form
therein
set
forth
do
you
tell
the
world
that
this
can
not
be
the
sense
of
the
bible
because
it
is
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
the
american
declaration
of
independence
because
it
grates
upon
your
instinct
of
liberty
because
it
reveals
god
in
opposition
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
because
if
it
be
the
sense
of
the
passage
then
the
bible
neither
ought
to
be
nor
can
be
received
by
mankind
as
a
divine
revelation
is
what
you
say
is
what
albert
barnes
affirms
in
his
philosophy
but
what
if
god
in
his
word
says
both
thy
bondmen
and
thy
bondmaids
which
thou
shalt
have
shall
be
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you
what
if
we
may
then
choose
between
albert
barnes
philosophy
and
god
truth
or
will
you
say
god
under
the
circumstances
the
israelites
in
the
matter
of
just
as
he
permitted
them
by
living
in
polygamy
them
sin
no
sir
god
them
to
be
he
the
law
of
their
social
state
he
one
form
of
his
ordained
government
among
them
moreover
you
take
it
for
granted
all
too
soon
that
the
israelites
committed
sin
in
their
polygamy
god
sanctioned
their
polygamy
it
was
therefore
not
sin
in
them
it
was
right
but
god
now
forbids
polygamy
under
the
gospel
and
now
it
is
sin
or
will
you
tell
us
the
iniquity
of
the
canaanites
was
then
full
and
god
time
to
punish
them
had
come
true
but
the
same
question
comes
up
did
god
punish
the
canaanites
by
placing
them
in
the
relation
of
slaves
to
his
people
by
express
command
which
compelled
them
to
sin
that
the
point
i
will
not
permit
you
to
evade
it
in
plainer
words
did
god
command
the
hebrews
to
make
slaves
of
their
to
buy
them
and
sell
them
to
regard
them
as
their
money
he
did
then
did
the
hebrews
sin
when
they
obeyed
god
command
no
then
they
did
what
was
right
and
it
was
right
because
god
made
it
so
then
hebrew
was
not
a
but
you
say
the
southern
is
well
we
shall
see
presently
just
here
the
abolitionist
who
professes
to
respect
the
scriptures
is
wont
to
tell
us
that
the
whole
subject
of
bondage
among
the
israelites
was
so
peculiar
to
god
ancient
dispensation
that
no
analogy
between
that
bondage
and
southern
slavery
can
be
brought
up
thus
he
attempts
to
raise
a
dust
out
of
the
jewish
institutions
to
prevent
people
from
seeing
that
slaveholding
then
was
the
same
thing
that
it
is
now
but
to
sustain
my
interpretation
of
the
plain
scriptures
given
i
will
go
back
five
hundred
years
before
the
existence
of
the
hebrew
nation
i
read
at
that
time
xiv
and
when
abraham
heard
that
his
brother
was
taken
captive
he
armed
his
trained
servants
born
in
his
own
house
three
hundred
and
eighteen
and
pursued
them
even
unto
damascus
xvii
and
all
the
men
of
his
house
born
in
the
house
and
bought
with
the
money
of
the
stranger
were
circumcised
xx
and
abimelech
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
and
and
gave
them
unto
abraham
xxiv
and
he
said
i
am
abraham
servant
and
the
lord
hath
blessed
my
master
greatly
and
he
is
become
great
and
he
hath
given
him
flocks
and
herds
and
silver
and
gold
and
and
and
camels
and
asses
abraham
a
sir
what
is
the
common
sense
of
these
scriptures
why
that
the
existed
in
abraham
day
as
it
had
long
before
and
has
ever
since
in
all
the
regions
of
syria
palestine
arabia
and
egypt
in
which
criminals
and
prisoners
of
war
were
sold
in
which
parents
sold
their
children
abraham
then
it
is
plain
bought
of
the
sellers
in
this
traffic
and
he
had
them
born
in
his
house
he
received
them
as
presents
do
you
tell
me
that
abraham
by
divine
authority
made
these
servants
part
of
his
family
social
and
religious
very
good
but
still
he
regarded
them
as
his
slaves
he
took
hagar
as
a
wife
but
he
treated
her
as
his
slave
yea
as
sarah
slave
and
as
such
he
gave
her
to
be
chastised
for
misconduct
by
her
mistress
yea
he
never
placed
ishmael
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
on
a
level
with
isaac
the
son
of
the
freewoman
if
then
he
so
regarded
hagar
and
ishmael
of
course
he
never
considered
his
other
slaves
on
an
equality
with
himself
true
had
he
been
childless
he
would
have
given
his
estate
to
eliezer
but
he
would
have
given
it
to
his
slave
true
had
isaac
not
been
born
he
would
have
given
his
wealth
to
ishmael
but
he
would
nave
given
it
to
the
son
of
his
bondwoman
sir
every
southern
planter
is
not
more
truly
a
than
abraham
and
the
southern
master
by
divine
authority
may
consider
his
slaves
part
of
his
social
and
religious
family
just
as
abraham
did
his
relation
is
just
that
of
abraham
he
has
slaves
of
an
inferior
type
of
mankind
from
abraham
bondmen
and
he
therefore
for
that
reason
as
well
as
from
the
fact
that
they
are
his
slaves
holds
them
lower
than
himself
but
nevertheless
he
is
a
in
no
other
sense
than
was
abraham
did
abraham
have
his
circumcised
every
southern
planter
may
have
his
baptized
i
baptized
not
long
since
a
the
master
and
mistress
offering
it
to
god
what
was
done
in
the
parlor
might
be
done
with
divine
approbation
on
every
plantation
so
then
abraham
lived
in
the
midst
of
a
system
of
exactly
the
same
in
nature
with
that
in
the
south
a
system
ordained
of
god
as
really
as
the
other
forms
of
government
round
about
him
he
then
with
the
divine
blessing
made
himself
the
master
of
slaves
men
women
and
children
by
buying
them
by
receiving
them
in
gifts
by
having
them
born
in
his
house
and
he
controlled
them
as
property
just
as
really
as
the
southern
master
in
the
present
day
i
ask
now
abraham
a
oh
no
you
reiterate
but
the
southern
master
is
why
the
southern
master
a
do
you
sir
or
anybody
contend
that
the
southern
master
seized
his
slave
in
africa
and
forcibly
brought
him
away
to
america
contrary
to
law
that
and
that
alone
was
and
is
kidnapping
in
divine
and
human
statute
no
what
then
why
the
abolitionist
responds
the
african
sold
his
victim
to
the
he
to
the
planter
and
the
negro
has
been
ever
since
in
bondage
therefore
of
the
has
cleaved
to
sellers
buyers
and
inheritors
to
this
time
and
will
through
all
generations
to
come
that
is
the
charge
and
it
brings
up
the
question
so
often
and
triumphantly
asked
by
the
abolitionist
you
he
says
to
the
you
admit
it
was
wrong
to
steal
the
negro
in
africa
can
the
then
throw
off
wrong
so
long
as
he
holds
the
slave
at
any
time
or
anywhere
thereafter
i
answer
yes
and
my
reply
shall
be
short
yet
conclusive
it
is
this
or
criminality
is
that
state
of
a
moral
agent
which
results
from
actual
commission
of
a
crime
or
offence
knowing
it
to
be
crime
or
violation
of
law
is
the
received
definition
of
and
i
know
do
accept
it
the
then
of
kidnapping
with
the
the
seller
the
buyer
and
holders
who
knowingly
and
intentionally
carried
on
the
traffic
contrary
to
the
divine
law
that
guilt
attaches
in
no
sense
whatever
as
a
personal
moral
responsibility
to
the
present
observe
i
am
here
discussing
the
question
of
mere
but
whether
the
master
who
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
can
hold
the
slave
without
the
moral
guilt
of
the
i
have
said
that
guilt
in
no
sense
whatever
rests
upon
him
for
he
neither
stole
the
man
nor
bought
him
from
the
kidnapper
nor
had
any
in
the
traffic
here
i
know
the
abolitionist
insists
that
the
master
guilty
of
this
unless
he
will
at
once
emancipate
the
slave
because
so
long
as
he
holds
him
he
thereby
personally
and
assumes
the
same
relation
which
the
original
kidnapper
or
buyer
held
to
the
this
is
cheever
argument
in
a
recent
popular
sermon
he
thinks
it
unanswerable
but
it
has
no
weight
whatever
it
is
met
perfectly
by
adding
word
to
his
proposition
thus
master
not
the
same
relation
which
the
original
or
buyer
held
to
the
the
master
to
god
and
to
his
slave
is
now
from
that
of
the
and
those
engaged
in
the
trade
and
his
obligation
is
wholly
different
what
is
his
relation
and
what
is
his
obligation
they
are
as
follows
the
master
finds
himself
with
no
taint
of
personal
concern
in
the
african
trade
in
a
christian
community
of
white
holding
control
over
his
black
who
is
so
unlike
himself
in
complexion
in
form
in
other
peculiarities
and
so
unequal
to
himself
in
attributes
of
body
and
mind
that
it
is
in
every
to
place
him
on
a
level
with
himself
in
the
community
is
his
relation
to
the
what
then
does
god
command
him
to
do
does
god
require
him
to
send
the
negro
back
to
his
heathen
home
from
whence
he
was
stolen
that
home
no
longer
exists
but
if
it
did
remain
does
god
command
the
master
to
send
his
christianized
slave
into
the
horrors
of
his
former
african
heathenism
no
god
has
placed
the
master
under
law
entirely
different
from
his
command
to
the
god
said
to
the
trader
the
negro
but
he
says
to
the
present
master
unto
the
negro
all
the
good
you
can
make
him
a
civilized
man
make
him
a
christian
man
lift
him
up
and
give
him
all
he
has
a
right
to
claim
in
the
good
of
the
whole
this
the
master
can
do
this
he
must
do
and
then
leave
the
result
with
the
almighty
we
reach
the
same
conclusion
by
asking
what
does
god
say
to
the
does
he
tell
him
to
ask
to
be
sent
back
to
heathen
africa
no
does
he
give
him
authority
to
claim
a
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
white
man
in
civil
and
social
relations
no
to
ask
the
first
would
be
to
ask
a
great
evil
to
claim
the
second
is
to
demand
a
natural
and
moral
impossibility
no
god
tells
him
to
seek
none
of
these
things
but
he
commands
him
to
know
the
facts
in
his
case
as
they
are
in
the
bible
and
have
ever
been
and
ever
will
be
in
providence
that
he
is
not
the
white
man
equal
that
he
can
never
have
his
level
that
he
must
not
claim
it
but
that
he
can
have
and
ought
to
have
and
must
have
all
of
good
in
his
condition
as
a
slave
until
god
may
reveal
a
higher
happiness
for
him
in
some
other
relation
than
that
must
have
to
the
the
present
then
by
declining
to
emancipate
his
bondman
does
not
place
himself
in
of
the
or
of
those
who
had
complicity
with
him
but
he
stands
in
that
nick
time
and
in
the
course
of
providence
where
in
the
transmission
of
african
slavery
and
i
have
sir
fairly
stated
this
your
strongest
argument
and
fully
met
it
southern
master
is
not
a
the
abolitionist
repulsed
in
his
charge
that
the
is
a
kidnapper
either
in
fact
or
by
voluntarily
assuming
any
of
the
relations
of
the
traffic
then
makes
his
impeachment
on
his
second
affirmation
mentioned
at
the
opening
of
this
letter
that
the
is
nevertheless
thus
because
in
the
simple
fact
of
being
a
master
he
from
the
negro
his
unalienable
right
to
freedom
this
sir
looks
like
a
new
view
of
the
subject
the
crime
forbidden
in
the
bible
was
stealing
and
selling
a
man
seizing
and
forcibly
carrying
away
from
country
or
state
a
human
being
man
woman
or
child
contrary
to
law
and
selling
or
holding
the
same
but
the
abolitionist
gives
us
to
understand
this
crime
rests
on
the
in
another
sense
namely
that
he
steals
from
the
negro
a
metaphysical
attribute
his
unalienable
right
to
liberty
this
is
a
new
sort
of
kidnapping
this
is
i
suppose
the
man
from
as
it
is
sometimes
elegantly
expressed
him
of
his
body
and
his
sir
i
admit
this
is
a
strong
figure
of
speech
a
beautiful
personification
a
sonorous
rhetorical
flourish
which
must
make
a
deep
impression
on
cheever
people
broadway
new
york
and
on
your
congregation
washington
square
philadelphia
but
it
is
certainly
not
the
bible
crime
of
and
whether
the
southern
master
is
of
this
sublimated
thing
will
be
understood
by
us
when
you
prove
that
the
negro
or
anybody
else
has
such
metaphysical
right
to
be
stolen
such
transcendental
liberty
not
in
subordination
to
the
good
of
the
whole
people
in
a
word
sir
this
refined
expression
is
after
all
just
the
old
averment
that
the
is
guilty
of
per
se
that
it
i
have
given
you
in
reply
the
old
testament
in
my
next
i
propose
to
inquire
what
the
new
testament
says
in
the
light
of
the
ross
huntsville
the
golden
rule
this
view
of
the
golden
rule
is
the
only
exposition
of
that
great
text
which
has
ever
been
given
in
words
sufficiently
clear
and
with
practical
illustrations
to
make
the
subject
intelligible
to
every
capacity
the
explanation
is
the
truth
of
god
and
it
settles
forever
the
slavery
question
so
far
as
it
rests
on
this
precept
of
jesus
christ
no
iv
rev
albert
barnes
dear
sir
the
argument
against
founded
on
the
golden
rule
is
the
strongest
which
can
be
presented
and
i
admit
that
if
it
can
not
be
perfectly
met
the
master
must
give
the
slave
liberty
and
equality
but
if
it
can
be
absolutely
refuted
then
the
in
this
regard
may
have
a
good
conscience
and
the
abolitionist
has
nothing
more
to
say
here
is
the
rule
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
matt
vii
in
your
on
this
passage
you
thus
write
this
command
has
been
usually
called
the
savior
a
name
given
to
it
on
account
of
its
great
that
expect
or
desire
others
in
similar
do
to
them
this
sir
is
your
exposition
of
the
savior
rule
of
right
with
all
due
respect
i
decline
your
interpretation
you
have
missed
the
meaning
by
leaving
out
one
word
observe
you
do
not
say
all
that
you
ought
to
or
that
to
no
but
you
make
the
expectation
or
desire
every
actually
has
similar
the
measure
duty
every
other
or
in
different
words
you
make
without
qualification
or
explanation
the
mere
expectation
or
desire
which
every
man
with
no
instruction
or
any
sort
of
training
wise
or
simple
good
or
bad
heathen
mohammedan
nominal
christian
would
have
similar
the
law
of
obligation
upon
him
to
do
that
same
thing
his
neighbor
sir
you
have
left
out
very
which
contains
the
sense
of
that
scripture
it
is
this
christ
in
his
rule
that
the
man
to
whom
he
gives
it
and
from
the
bible
or
providence
or
natural
conscience
far
as
in
with
the
bible
the
in
which
god
has
placed
him
and
the
in
those
relations
the
rule
that
he
knows
what
he
ought
to
or
in
similar
circumstances
i
will
test
this
affirmation
by
several
and
varied
illustrations
i
will
show
how
christ
according
to
your
exposition
of
his
rule
speaks
on
the
subject
of
marriage
fugitive
from
and
how
he
truly
speaks
on
these
subjects
right
according
to
your
view
of
the
golden
indian
and
missionary
prisoner
tied
to
a
tree
stuck
over
with
burning
splinters
here
is
an
indian
torturing
his
prisoner
the
missionary
approaches
and
beseeches
him
to
regard
golden
humph
utters
the
savage
golden
rule
what
that
why
says
the
good
man
all
that
you
or
other
indians
in
similar
circumstances
do
you
even
so
to
them
humph
growls
the
warrior
with
a
fierce
smile
missionary
good
that
what
i
do
now
if
i
was
tied
to
that
tree
i
would
and
to
have
revenge
to
do
to
me
as
i
do
to
him
and
i
would
sing
my
as
he
sings
his
missionary
your
rule
is
indian
rule
good
rule
missionary
humph
and
he
sticks
more
splinters
into
his
victim
brandishes
his
tomahawk
and
yells
sir
what
has
the
missionary
to
say
after
this
perfect
proof
that
you
have
mistaken
the
great
law
of
right
verily
he
finds
that
the
rule
with
your
explanation
tells
the
indian
to
torture
his
prisoner
verily
he
finds
that
the
wild
man
has
the
best
of
the
argument
he
finds
he
had
left
out
the
word
ought
and
that
he
ca
put
it
in
until
he
teaches
the
indian
things
which
as
yet
he
do
know
yea
he
finds
he
gave
the
commandment
too
soon
for
that
he
must
begin
back
of
that
commandment
and
teach
the
savage
god
ordination
of
the
relations
in
which
he
is
to
his
before
he
can
make
him
comprehend
or
apply
the
rule
as
christ
gives
it
void
under
your
interpretation
of
the
golden
lucy
stone
and
moses
lady
on
sofa
having
just
divorced
herself
moses
with
the
tables
of
the
law
appears
she
falls
at
his
feet
and
covers
her
face
with
her
hands
this
woman
everybody
knows
was
married
some
time
since
after
a
fashion
that
is
to
say
protesting
publicly
against
all
laws
of
wedlock
and
entering
into
the
relation
so
long
only
as
she
or
her
husband
might
continue
pleased
therewith
very
well
then
i
without
insult
to
her
or
offense
to
my
readers
suppose
that
about
this
time
she
has
shown
her
unalienable
right
to
liberty
and
equality
by
giving
her
husband
a
bill
of
divorcement
free
again
she
reclines
on
her
couch
and
is
reading
the
tribune
it
is
but
there
is
a
light
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun
shining
round
about
her
and
who
saw
god
on
sinai
stands
before
her
the
glory
on
his
face
and
the
tables
of
stone
in
his
hands
the
woman
falls
before
him
veils
her
eyes
with
her
trembling
fingers
and
cries
out
moses
oh
i
believed
till
now
that
thou
practised
deception
in
claiming
to
be
sent
of
god
to
israel
but
now
i
know
thou
didst
see
god
in
the
burning
bush
and
heard
him
speak
that
law
from
the
holy
mountain
moses
i
know
i
and
moses
answers
and
says
unto
her
woman
thou
art
one
of
a
great
class
in
this
land
who
claim
to
be
more
just
than
god
more
pure
than
their
maker
who
have
made
their
inward
light
their
god
woman
thou
in
hast
uttered
of
from
man
and
verily
thou
hast
asserted
this
claim
to
equality
and
unalienable
right
even
now
by
giving
thy
husband
his
bill
of
divorcement
in
thy
sense
of
the
golden
rule
yea
verily
thou
hast
done
unto
him
all
that
thou
or
of
him
in
similar
circumstances
and
now
thou
thinkest
thyself
free
again
woman
thou
art
a
sinner
verily
thine
inward
light
and
declaration
of
independence
and
golden
rule
do
well
agree
the
one
with
the
other
verily
thou
hast
learned
of
jefferson
and
channing
and
barnes
but
woman
notwithstanding
thou
hast
sat
at
the
feet
of
these
wise
men
i
moses
say
thou
art
a
sinner
before
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
the
gospel
woman
thy
light
is
darkness
thy
declaration
of
equality
and
right
is
vanity
and
folly
and
thy
golden
rule
is
license
to
wickedness
woman
hast
thou
ears
hear
i
by
authority
of
god
ordained
that
the
man
should
rule
over
thee
i
placed
thee
and
children

under
the
same
law

subjection

the
government
ordained
of
god

for
the
hardness

them
and
made
it
right
to
give
their
wives
a
bill

hear
paul
having
the
same
spirit
of
god
confirms
my
word
he
commands
and
children
and
servants
after
this
manner
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
it
is
fit
in
the

children
obey
your

this
is
well
pleasing

obey
in
all

your

not
with
as
but
in
singleness

paul
makes
the
same
and
the
same
the
of
the
rule
he
varies
with
the
relations
he
requires
it
to
be
in
the
of
the
husband
even
as
christ
loved
the
church
in
the
of
the
father
not
provoking
the
children
to
anger
lest
they
be
discouraged
in
justice

that
he
also
has
a
master

paul

to
thee
the

thou

thou
the
relation

ruin
golden

in
your
meaning
carried

elegant

gospel
according
to
curran
and
the
british
parliament
jamaica
sir
to
say
nothing
of
domingo
is
illustration
of
your
theory
of
the
golden
rule
in
negro
emancipation
you
tell
the
southern
master
that
all
he
would
or
if
he
were
a
slave
he
must
do
unto
his
bondman
that
he
must
not
pause
to
ask
whether
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
be
ordained
of
god
or
not
no
you
tell
him
he
would
or
liberty
were
he
a
slave
settles
the
question
as
to
what
he
is
to
do
he
must
let
his
bondman
go
free
yea
is
what
you
teach
because
the
moment
you
put
in
the
word
ought
and
say
all
that
you
ought
to
or
all
that
you
god
commands
you
to
or
in
your
relations
to
men
established
by
him
that
to
sir
when
you
thus
explain
the
golden
rule
then
your
argument
against
so
far
as
founded
on
this
rule
is
at
once
arrested
it
is
stopped
short
in
full
career
it
has
to
wait
for
reinforcement
of
fact
which
may
never
come
up
for
suppose
the
fact
to
be
that
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
one
mode
of
the
government
ordained
of
god
then
sir
the
master
fact
and
what
the
slave
a
ought
to
or
he
the
master
then
fulfils
the
golden
rule
when
he
does
that
unto
his
slave
which
in
similar
circumstances
he
ought
to
expect
be
done
unto
now
comes
the
question
ought
he
then
to
or
liberty
and
equality
that
is
the
question
of
questions
on
this
subject
and
without
hesitation
i
reply
the
golden
rule
decides
yea
or
nay
and
as
word
or
providence
shows
that
the
good
the
family
the
community
the
requires
that
the
slave
is
or
is
not
be
set
free
and
made
that
good
god
reveals
settles
the
question
let
the
master
then
see
to
it
how
he
hears
god
word
as
to
that
good
let
him
see
to
it
how
he
understands
god
providence
as
to
that
good
let
him
see
to
it
that
he
makes
no
mistake
as
to
that
good
for
god
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
if
he
will
not
hear
what
he
tells
him
as
to
that
good
god
will
not
justify
him
if
he
has
a
bad
conscience
or
blunders
in
his
philosophy
god
will
punish
him
if
he
fails
to
bless
his
land
by
letting
the
bond
go
free
when
he
ought
to
emancipate
and
god
will
punish
him
if
he
brings
a
curse
upon
his
country
by
freeing
his
slave
when
he
ought
not
to
give
him
liberty
so
then
golden
rule
does
of
itself
to
man
at
all
what
are
relations
his
but
it
tells
him
what
he
is
do
already
knows
them
so
then
you
sir
can
not
be
permitted
to
tell
the
world
that
this
rule
must
emancipate
all
the
negro
slaves
in
the
united
states
no
matter
how
unprepared
they
may
be
no
matter
how
degraded
no
matter
how
unlike
and
unequal
to
the
white
man
by
creation
no
matter
if
it
be
a
natural
and
moral
impossibility
no
matter
the
golden
rule
must
emancipate
by
authority

slave
obeying
the

under
your
honorable
joshua
giddings
and
the
angel
of
the

hon
gentleman
at
table
nine
runaway
negroes
dining
with
him
the

uninvited
comes
in
and
disturbs
the
feast
giddings
has
boasted
in
congress
of
having
had
nine
fugitive
slaves
to
break
bread
with
him
at
one
time
i
choose
then
to
imagine
that
during
the
dinner
the
angel
who
found
hagar
by
the
fountain
stands
suddenly
in
the
midst
and
says
to
the
negroes
ye
slaves
whence
came
ye
and
whither
will
ye
go
and
they
answer
and
say
we
flee
from
the
face
of
our
masters
this
abolitionist
told
us
to
kill
and
steal
and
run
away
from
bondage
and
we
have
murdered
and
stolen
and
escaped
he
thou
seest
welcomes
us
to
liberty
and
equality
we
and
to
be
members
of
congress
governors
of
states
to
marry
among
the
great
and
one
of
us
to
be
president
giddings
and
all
abolitionists
tell
us
that
these
honors
belong
to
us
equally
as
to
white
people
and
will
be
given
under
the
golden
rule
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
says
to
them
ye
slaves
return
unto
your
masters
and
submit
yourselves
under
their
hands
i
sent
your
fathers
and
i
send
you
into
bondage
i
mean
it
unto
good
and
i
will
bring
it
to
pass
to
save
much
people
alive
then
turning
to
the
tempter
he
says
thou
a
statesman
thou
a
reader
of
my
word
and
providence
why
hast
thou
not
understood
my
speech
to
hagar
i
gave
her
a
slave
to
sarah
she
fled
from
her
mistress
i
sent
her
back
why
hast
thou
not
understood
my
word
four
thousand
years
ago
that
slave
shall
not
flee
from
his
master
why
hast
thou
also
perverted
my
law
in
deuteronomy
xxiii
i
say
therein
shalt
not
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
which
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou
shalt
not
oppress
him
why
hast
thou
not
known
that
i
meant
the
who
escaped
from
his
master
i
commanded
israel
in
such
case
not
to
hold
in
bondage
i
made
this
specific
law
for
this
specific
fact
why
hast
thou
taught
that
in
this
commandment
i
gave
license
to
all
and
in
the
whole
land
of
israel
to
run
away
from
their
masters
why
hast
thou
thus
made
me
in
one
saying
contradict
and
make
void
all
my
laws
wherein
i
ordained
that
the
hebrews
should
be
over
their
brethren
during
years
and
over
the
heathen
forever
why
hast
thou
in
all
this
changed
my
golden
rule
i
in
that
rule
that
men
from
revelation
and
providence
the
relations
in
which
i
have
placed
them
and
their
duties
therein
i
then
command
them
to
do
unto
others
what
they
thus
they
to
do
unto
them
in
these
relations
and
i
make
the
obligation
quick
and
powerful
by
telling
every
man
to
imagine
himself
in
such
conditions
and
then
he
will
know
he
should
do
unto
his
neighbor
why
hast
thou
made
void
my
law
by
making
me
say
that
thou
or
of
others
in
similar
circumstances
do
to
them
i
never
imagined
to
give
such
license
to
folly
and
sin
why
hast
thou
imagined
such
license
to
iniquity
verily
thou
tempter
thou
hast
in
thy
golden
rule
made
these
slaves
thieves
and
murderers
and
art
now
eating
with
them
the
bread
of
sin
and
death
why
hast
thou
tortured
my
speech
wherein
i
say
that
i
have
made
of
all
nations
of
men
to
mean
that
i
have
created
all
men
equal
and
endowed
them
with
rights
unalienable
save
in
their
consent
i
never
said
that
thing
i
said
that
i
made
all
men
to
descend
from
parentage
that
is
what
i
say
in
that
place
why
hast
thou
tortured
that
plain
truth
thou
mightest
as
well
teach
that
all
moving
creatures
that
have
life
and
fowl
that
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven
are
because
i
said
i
brought
them
forth
the
thou
mightest
as
well
say
that
cattle
and
creeping
thing
and
beast
of
the
earth
created
because
i
said
i
brought
them
forth
the
as
to
affirm
the
of
because
i
say
they
are
one
nay
i
have
made
men
unequal
as
the
leaves
of
the
trees
the
sands
of
the
sea
the
stars
of
heaven
i
have
made
them
so
in
harmony
with
the
infinite
variety
and
inequality
in
every
thing
in
my
creation
and
i
have
made
them
unequal
in
my
had
i
made
all
men
equal
in
attributes
of
body
and
mind
then
would
never
have
realized
the
varied
glories
of
his
destiny
and
had
i
given
equality
of
nature
and
unalienable
rights
then
i
had
made
the
earth
an
aceldama
and
valley
of
gehenna
for
what
would
be
the
in
all
the
earth
among
men
equal
in
body
and
mind
equal
in
power
equal
in
depravity
equal
in
will
each
one
maintaining
rights
unalienable
when
would
the
war
end
who
would
be
the
victors
where
all
are
giants
who
would
sue
for
peace
where
none
will
submit
what
would
be
social
life
who
would
be
the
weak
the
loving
who
would
seek
or
need
forbearance
compassion
benevolence
who
would
be
the
grateful
who
would
be
the
humble
the
meek
what
would
be
virtue
what
vice
what
joy
or
sorrow
nay
i
have
made
men
and
given
them
that
i
might
institute
human
government
and
reveal
human
character
why
hast
thou
been
willingly
ignorant
of
these
first
principles
of
the
oracles
of
god
which
would
have
made
thee
truly
a
christian
philosopher
and
statesman
slave
obeying
the
golden
rule
as
christ
gave
rev
barnes
and
the
apostle
paul
minister
of
the
gospel
in
his
study
fugitive
slave
converted
under
his
preaching
inquiring
whether
it
is
not
his
duty
to
return
to
his
master
paul
appears
and
rebukes
the
minister
for
wresting
his
gospel
with
all
respect
and
affection
for
you
sir
i
imagine
a
slave
having
run
away
from
his
master
and
become
a
christian
under
your
preaching
might
with
the
bible
in
his
hands
and
the
holy
spirit
in
his
heart
have
despite
your
training
question
of
conscience
whether
he
did
right
to
leave
his
master
and
ought
not
to
go
back
and
i
think
how
paul
would
listen
and
what
he
would
say
to
your
interpretation
of
his
epistle
to
philemon
i
think
he
would
say
i
withstand
thee
to
thy
face
because
thou
art
to
be
blamed
why
hast
thou
written
in
thy
that
the
word
i
apply
to
onesimus
may
mean
not
but
servant
why
hast
thou
said
this
in
unsupported
assertion
why
hast
thou
given
no
respect
to
robinson
and
all
thy
wise
men
who
agree
that
the
word
wherein
i
express
relation
to
philemon
never
means
a
hired
servant
but
a
the
property
of
his
master
a
living
possession
why
hast
thou
called
in
question
the
fact
that
philemon
was
a
why
hast
thou
taught
that
if
he
was
a
when
he
became
a
christian
he
could
not
to
be
a
and
a
christian
that
if
he
did
so
he
would
not
be
in
but
an
in
the
church
see
notes
i
say
philemon
was
the
master
of
onesimus
in
the
real
sense
of
a
under
roman
law
in
which
he
had
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
him
being
thereby
a
master
in
possession
of
power
unknown
in
the
united
states
and
yet
i
call
philemon
dearly
beloved
and
i
tell
him
that
i
send
to
him
again
onesimus
who
had
been
unprofitable
to
him
in
time
past
but
now
being
a
christian
he
would
be
profitable
i
tell
him
i
send
him
again
not
a
slave
only
but
above
a
slave
a
christian
brother
beloved
specially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
him
both
the
and
in
the
lord
dost
thou
know
albert
barnes
what
i
mean
by
that
word
the
flesh
verily
i
knew
the
things
wherein
the
master
and
the
slave
are
beloved
the
one
of
the
other
in
the
best
affections
of
human
nature
and
in
the
lord
therefore
i
say
to
philemon
that
he
could
receive
onesimus
his
and
yet
as
a
more
by
reason
of
his
relation
to
him
as
than
i
could
regard
him
yea
verily
and
i
say
to
thee
albert
barnes
thou
hast
never
been
in
the
south
and
thou
dost
not
understand
and
canst
not
understand
the
force
or
even
the
meaning
of
my
words
the
the
love
of
the
master
and
the
slave
to
one
but
philemon
i
knew
would
feel
its
power
and
so
i
made
that
appeal
to
him
why
hast
thou
said
that
i
did
not
send
onesimus
back
authority
i
did
send
him
back
by
authority
yea
by
authority
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
for
it
was
my
duty
to
send
him
again
to
philemon
whether
he
had
been
willing
to
go
or
not
and
it
was
his
duty
to
go
but
he
was
willing
so
we
both
felt
our
obligations
and
when
i
commanded
he
cheerfully
obeyed
what
else
was
my
duty
and
his
had
i
not
said
in
line
upon
line
and
in
precept
upon
precept
obey
in
all
things
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
not
with
as
but
in
singleness
of
heart
pleasing
god
coloss
iii
had
not
peter
written
be
subject
to
your
masters
with
all
fear
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to
the
froward
pet
ii
onesimus
had
broken
these
commandments
when
he
fled
from
his
master
was
it
not
then
of
my
responsibility
to
send
him
again
to
philemon
and
was
it
not
christ
law
to
him
to
return
and
submit
himself
under
his
master
hand
why
then
hast
thou
not
understood
my
speech
has
it
been
even
because
thou
couldst
not
my
word
what
else
has
hindered
what
more
could
i
have
said
than
in
tim
vi
i
do
say
to
rebuke
all
abolitionists
yea
i
describe
them
i
show
their
principles
as
fully
as
if
i
had
called
them
by
name
in
boston
in
new
york
in
philadelphia
and
said
they
would
live
in
and
yet
thou
hast
in
thy
commentary
on
my
letter
to
timothy
utterly
distorted
maimed
and
falsified
my
meaning
thou
hast
mingled
truth
and
untruth
so
together
as
to
make
me
say
what
was
not
and
is
not
in
my
mind
for
thou
teachest
the
slave
while
professing
not
so
to
teach
him
that
i
tell
him
that
he
is
to
count
his
master
worthy
of
all
honor
that
he
to
him
that
he
is
to
do
him
service
as
to
a
christian
faithful
and
beloved
but
thou
teachest
the
slave
in
my
name
to
regard
his
christian
master
an
in
the
sight
of
christ
if
he
a
thou
tellest
him
to
obey
in
the
sense
in
which
he
is
to
submit
to
injustice
oppression
and
cruelty
and
that
he
is
ever
to
seek
to
throw
off
the
yoke
in
his
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
to
liberty
see
notes
this
is
what
thou
hast
taught
as
my
gospel
but
i
commanded
thee
to
teach
and
exhort
the
i
commanded
thee
to
say
after
this
way
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honor
that
the
name
of
god
and
his
doctrine
be
not
blasphemed
and
they
that
have
believing
masters
let
them
not
despise
them
because
they
are
brethren
but
rather
do
them
service
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved
partakers
of
the
benefit
these
things
teach
and
exhort
thou
in
thy
art
compelled
though
most
unwillingly
to
confess
that
i
do
mean
in
this
place
in
the
full
and
proper
sense
yea
slaves
under
the
roman
law
good
then
do
i
here
tell
slaves
to
count
their
masters
even
when
not
christians
worthy
of
all
honor
and
when
christians
to
regard
them
as
faithful
and
beloved
and
not
to
despise
them
and
to
do
them
service
yet
after
all
this
do
i
say
to
these
same
slaves
that
they
have
a
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
to
liberty
under
which
whenever
they
think
fit
i
command
them
to
dishonor
their
masters
despise
them
and
run
away
sir
i
did
never
so
instruct
slaves
nay
i
did
never
command
thee
so
to
teach
them
but
i
did
and
do
exhort
thee
not
so
to
train
them
for
i
said
then
and
say
now
to
thee
any
man
teach
slaves
otherwise
than
to
honor
their
masters
as
faithful
and
beloved
and
to
do
them
service
and
consent
not
to
wholesome
words
even
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
to
the
doctrine
which
is
according
to
godliness
he
is
proud
knowing
nothing
but
doting
about
questions
and
strifes
of
words
whereof
cometh
envy
strife
railings
evil
surmisings
perverse
disputings
of
men
of
corrupt
minds
and
destitute
of
the
truth
supposing
that
gain
is
godliness
from
such
withdraw
thyself
what
more
could
i
have
said
to
the
abolitionists
of
my
day
what
more
can
i
say
to
them
in
this
day
which
was
true
of
them
two
thousand
years
ago
is
true
now
i
rebuked
abolitionists
then
and
i
rebuke
them
now
i
tell
them
the
things
in
their
hearts
the
things
on
their
tongues
the
things
in
their
hands
are
contrary
to
wholesome
words
even
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
canst
thou
my
words
in
this
place
without
feeling
how
faithfully
i
have
given
the
head
and
the
heart
and
the
words
and
the
doings
of
the
men
from
whom
thou
hast
not
withdrawn
thyself
verily
thou
canst
not
my
speech
and
therefore
thou
canst
not
interpret
my
gospel
thou
believest
it
is
impossible
that
i
sanction
slavery
hence
it
is
impossible
for
thee
to
understand
my
words
for
i
do
sanction
slavery
how
thus
i
found
slavery
in
asia
in
greece
in
rome
i
saw
it
to
be
one
mode
of
the
government
ordained
of
god
i
regarded
it
in
most
conditions
of
fallen
mankind
necessarily
and
irresistibly
part
of
such
government
and
therefore
as
natural
as
wise
as
good
in
such
conditions
as
the
other
ways
men
are
ruled
in
the
state
or
the
family
i
took
up
slavery
then
as
such
ordained
government
wise
good
yea
best
in
certain
circumstances
until
in
the
elevating
spirit
and
power
of
my
gospel
the
slave
is
made
fit
for
the
liberty
and
equality
of
his
master
if
he
can
be
so
lifted
up
hence
i
make
the
rule
of
magistrate
subject
master
and
servant
parent
and
child
husband
and
wife
the
same
rule
i
make
it
the
same
right
in
the
to
control
the
and
the
of
the
bound
to
obey
whatever
the
difference
in
the
relations
and
service
to
be
rendered
yea
i
give
the
same
to
all
in
these
relations
and
thus
in
all
my
words
i
make
it
plainly
to
be
understood
that
i
regard
slavery
to
be
as
righteous
a
mode
of
government
as
that
of
magistrate
and
subject
parent
and
child
husband
and
wife
during
the
circumstances
and
times
in
which
god
is
pleased
to
have
it
continue
i
saw
all
the
injustice
the
oppression
the
cruelty
masters
might
be
guilty
of
and
were
and
are
now
guilty
of
but
i
saw
no
more
injustice
oppression
and
cruelty
in
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
than
i
saw
in
all
other
forms
of
rule
even
in
that
of
husband
and
wife
parent
and
child
in
my
gospel
i
condemn
wrong
in
all
these
states
of
life
while
i
fully
sanction
and
sustain
the
relations
themselves
i
tell
the
magistrate
husband
father
master
how
to
rule
i
tell
the
subject
wife
child
servant
how
to
submit
hence
i
command
the
slave
not
to
flee
from
bondage
just
as
i
require
the
subject
the
wife
the
child
not
to
resist
or
flee
from
obedience
i
warn
the
slave
if
he
leaves
his
master
he
has
sinned
and
must
return
and
i
make
it
the
duty
of
all
men
to
see
to
it
that
shall
go
hence
i
myself
did
what
i
command
others
to
do
i
sent
onesimus
back
to
his
master
thus
i
sanction
slavery
everywhere
in
the
new
testament
but
it
is
impossible
for
thee
with
thy
principles
thy
law
of
reason
thy
law
of
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
thy
elevation
of
the
declaration
of
independence
above
the
ordinance
of
god
to
sustain
slavery
nay
it
is
impossible
for
thee
with
thy
interpretation
of
christ
golden
rule
to
recognise
the
system
of
servile
labor
nay
it
is
impossible
for
thee
to
tell
slave
to
return
to
his
master
as
i
sent
onesimus
back
nay
thou
art
guarded
by
thy
golden
rule
thou
tellest
him
that
if
thou
hadst
been
in
his
place
thou
wouldst
have
freedom
that
thou
wouldst
have
run
away
and
that
thou
wouldst
not
now
return
that
thou
wouldst
have
regarded
thy
created
equality
and
unalienable
right
as
thy
supreme
law
and
have
disregarded
and
scorned
all
other
obligations
as
revelation
from
therefore
thou
now
doest
unto
him
thou
wouldst
or
him
to
do
unto
thee
in
similar
circumstances
thou
tellest
him
he
did
right
to
run
away
and
will
do
right
not
to
return
this
is
thy
golden
rule
but
i
did
not
instruct
thee
so
to
learn
christ
nay
this
slave
knows
thou
hast
not
not
given
him
the
mind
of
christ
nay
he
knows
that
christ
commands
thee
to
send
him
to
his
master
again
and
thus
do
what
thou
oughtest
to
or
in
similar
circumstances
yea
now
and
this
slave
like
onesimus
will
bless
thee
for
giving
him
a
good
conscience
whenever
he
will
return
to
his
obedience
thus
paul
the
aged
speaks
to
thee
so
then
the
golden
rule
is
the
whole
bible
yea
christ
says
it
the
law
and
the
prophets
yea
it
is
the
old
testament
and
the
new
condensed
and
with
glory
of
providence
in
one
sublime
aphorism
which
can
be
understood
and
obeyed
only
by
those
who
what
the
bible
or
providence
reveals
as
to
man
varied
conditions
and
his
obligations
therein
i
think
sir
i
have
refuted
your
interpretation
of
the
golden
rule
and
have
given
its
true
meaning
the
then
may
have
a
good
conscience
under
this
commandment
let
him
so
exercise
himself
as
to
have
a
conscience
void
of
offence
towards
god
and
towards
men
yours
ross
conclusion
i
intended
to
and
may
yet
in
a
subsequent
edition
write
two
more
letters
to
barnes
the
to
show
how
infidelity
has
been
passing
off
from
the
south
to
the
north
especially
since
the
of
jackson
the
other
to
meet
barnes
argument
founded
on
the
spirit
of
the
age
the
end
