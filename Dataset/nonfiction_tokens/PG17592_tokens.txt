preface
mehemmed
ali
pasha
the
victorious
pacificator
of
egypt
and
arabia
is
already
renowned
in
the
civilized
world
egypt
once
the
home
of
discord
and
the
headquarters
of
anarchy
under
his
administration
has
long
enjoyed
peace
and
prosperity
is
permeable
in
all
directions
and
in
perfect
safety
to
the
merchant
and
the
traveler
and
is
yearly
progressing
in
wealth
and
improvement
the
viceroy
has
been
particularly
attentive
to
revive
and
extend
those
commercial
relations
of
egypt
with
the
surrounding
countries
which
once
rendered
it
the
richest
and
most
flourishing
territory
in
the
ancient
world
a
well
chosen
library
of
the
best
european
books
on
the
art
military
geography
astronomy
medicine
history
and
the
fine
arts
has
been
purchased
from
europe
by
the
viceroy
and
placed
in
the
palace
of
ismael
pasha
where
is
also
a
school
at
the
expense
for
the
instruction
of
the
mussulman
youth
in
the
italian
language
and
the
sciences
of
the
franks
to
which
establishments
has
been
lately
added
a
printing
press
for
printing
books
in
the
turkish
arabic
and
persian
languages
and
a
weekly

and
italian
the
library
and
the
press
are
under
the
superintendence
of
osman
noureddin
effendi
a
young
turk
of
great
good
sense
and
who
is
well
versed
in
the
literature
of
europe
where
he
has
resided
for
several
years
by
order
of
the
viceroy
for
his
education
he
is
at
present
engaged
in
translating
into
turkish
some
works
on
tactics
for
the
use
of
his
countrymen
for
several
years
past
the
inland
commerce
of
this
favored
land
had
suffered
great
interruptions
from
the
confusion
and
discord
to
which
the
countries
on
the
upper
nile
have
been
a
prey
the
chiefs
of
shageia
had
formed
themselves
into
a
singular
aristocracy
of
brigands
and
pillaged
all
the
provinces
and
caravans
within
their
reach
without
mercy
and
without
restraint
while
the
civil
wars
which
have
distracted
the
once
powerful
kingdom
of
sennaar
for
these
last
eighteen
years
had
occasioned
an
almost
entire
cessation
of
a
commerce
from
which
egypt
had
derived
great
advantages
his
highness
the
viceroy
in
consequence
determined
as
the
most
effectual
means
of
putting
an
end
to
these
disorders
to
subject
those
countries
to
his
dominion
four
thousand
troops
were
accordingly
put
under
the
command
of
ismael
pasha
the
youngest
son
of
the
viceroy
with
orders
to
conquer
all
the
provinces
on
the
nile
from
the
second
cataract
to
sennaar
inclusive
through
the
influence
of
the
recommendation
of
henry
salt
his
britannic
majesty
consul
general
in
egypt
i
was
ordered
by
the
viceroy
to
accompany
this
expedition
with
the
rank
of
topgi
bashi
a
chief
of
artillery
and
with
directions
to
propose
such
plans
of
operation
to
the
pasha
ismael
as
i
should
deem
expedient
but
which
the
pasha
might
adopt
or
reject
as
he
should
think
proper
this
expedition
has
been
perfectly
successful
and
the
conquest
of
the
extensive
and
fertile
countries
which
in
the
reign
of
candace
repulsed
the
formidable
legions
of
rome
has
been
effected
at
an
expense
not
greater
than
the
blood
of
about
two
hundred
soldiers
the
principal
cause
of
a
success
so
extraordinary
at
such
a
price
has
been
the
humanity
and
good
faith
of
the
pasha
ismael
towards
those
provinces
that
submitted
without
fighting
perfect
security
of
person
and
property
was
assured
to
the
peaceable
and
severe
examples
were
made
of
those
few
of
the
soldiery
who
in
a
very
few
instances
presumed
to
violate
it
the
good
consequences
of
this
deportment
toward
the
people
of
these
countries
have
been
evident
all
have
seen
that
those
who
have
preferred
peace
before
war
have
had
peace
without
war
and
that
those
who
preferred
war
before
peace
have
not
had
peace
but
at
the
price
of
ruin
the
destruction
or
disarmament
of
the
brigands
who
have
heretofore
pillaged
those
countries
with
impunity
the
establishment
of
order
and
tranquility
the
security
now
assured
to
the
peasants
and
the
caravans
and
the
annexment
of
so
many
fine
provinces
and
kingdoms
to
the
sway
of
the
viceroy
of
egypt
are
not
the
only
consequences
of
this
expedition
that
will
give
him
glory
this
expedition
has
laid
open
to
the
researches
of
the
geographer
and
the
antiquarian
a
river
and
a
country
highly
interesting
and
hitherto
imperfectly
known
to
the
civilized
world
the
nile
on
whose
banks
we
have
marched
for
so
many
hundred
miles
is
the
most
famous
river
in
the
world
for
the
uncertainty
of
its
source
and
the
obscurity
of
its
course
at
present
this
obscurity
ceases
to
exist
and
before
the
return
of
the
pasha
ismael
this
uncertainty
will
probably
be
no
more
the
countries
we
have
traversed
are
renowned
in
history
and
poetry
as
the
land
of
ancient
and
famous
nations
which
have
established
and
overthrown
mighty
empires
and
have
originated
the
religions
the
learning
the
arts
and
the
civilization
of
nations
long
since
extinct
and
who
have
been
preceded
by
their
instructors
in
the
common
road
which
every
thing
human
must
travel
this
famous
land
of
cush
and
saba
at
present
overawed
by
the
camps
of
the
osmanii
has
presented
to
our
observation
many
memorials
of
the
power
and
splendor
of
its
ancient
masters
the
remains
of
cities
once
populous
ruined
temples
once
magnificent
colossal
statues
of
idols
once
adored
but
now
prostrated
by
the
strong
arms
of
time
and
truth
and
more
than
a
hundred
pyramids
which
entomb
the
bodies
of
kings
and
conquerors
once
mighty
but
whose
memory
has
perished
have
suspended
for
awhile
the
march
of
our
troops
have
attracted
the
notice
of
the
franks
who
voyage
with
the
army
with
the
favor
and
the
protection
of
the
pasha
and
which
doubtless
ere
long
by
engaging
the
attention
and
researches
of
men
of
learning
will
unite
the
names
of
mehemmed
ali
and
ismael
his
son
with
the
history
and
monuments
of
this
once
famous
and
long
secluded
land
in
a
manner
that
will
make
the
memory
of
both
renowned
and
inseparable
that
the
further
progress
of
the
pasha
ismael
southward
of
his
present
position
will
be
successful
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
and
i
derive
great
pleasure
from
the
reflection
that
his
success
will
still
further
augment
the
glory
of
the
man
whom
the
sultan
delights
to
honor
and
who
has
done
so
much
for
the
honor
of
the
mussulmans
the
reader
will
find
that
i
have
sometimes
in
the
course
of
this
journal
included
the
events
of
several
days
in
the
form
of
narrative
particularly
in
my
account
of
the
second
cataract
wherever
i
have
so
done
it
has
been
occasioned
by
paroxysms
of
a
severe
ophthalmia
which
afflicted
me
for
fifteen
months
and
rendered
me
at
times
incapable
of
writing
a
narrative
i
arrived
at
the
camp
at
wady
haifa
on
the
second
cataract
on
the
of
the
moon
zilhadge
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
where
i
found
about
four
thousand
troops
consisting
of
turkish
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
and
a
considerable
proportion
of
bedouin
cavalry
and
mogrebin
foot
soldiers
besides
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
large
boats
loaded
with
provisions
and
ammunition
and
destined
to
follow
the
march
of
the
army
to
the
upper
countries
of
the
nile
of
zilhadge
presented
myself
to
his
excellency
the
pasha
ismael
by
whom
i
was
received
in
a
very
nattering
manner
and
presented
with
a
suit
of
his
own
habiliments
on
my
asking
his
excellency
if
he
had
any
orders
for
me
he
replied
that
he
was
at
present
solely
occupied
in
expediting
the
loading
and
forwarding
the
boats
carrying
the
provisions
of
the
army
but
that
when
that
was
finished
he
would
send
for
me
to
receive
his
commands
i
employed
this
interval
in
noticing
the
assemblage
that
composed
the
army
the
chiefs
and
soldiers
i
found
well
disposed
to
do
their
duty
through
attachment
to
their
young
commander
and
through
fear
of
mehemmed
ali
they
were
alert
to
execute
what
orders
they
received
and
very
busy
in
smoking
their
pipes
when
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
on
the
i
was
sent
for
by
the
pasha
with
whom
i
remained
in
private
audience
for
an
hour
on
the
of
the
moon
zilhadge
was
attacked
by
that
distressing
malady
the
ophthalmia
in
two
days
the
progress
of
the
disorder
was
such
that
my
eyes
were
closed
up
and
incapable
of
supporting
the
light
and
occasioned
me
such
acute
anguish
that
i
could
get
no
sleep
but
by
the
effect
of
laudanum
this
misfortune
at
this
crisis
was
peculiarly
vexatious
and
mortifying
for
me
as
it
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
accompany
the
pasha
who
departed
with
the
army
for
dongola
on
the
taking
his
route
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
and
leaving
the
divan
effendi
and
a
small
party
of
soldiers
to
expedite
the
loading
and
forwarding
the
boats
that
had
not
as
yet
got
ready
to
proceed
up
the
cataract
on
the
of
mofiarram
i
embarked
on
board
the
boat
of
the
frank
surgeons
attached
to
the
army
and
left
the
lower
or
north
end
of
the
second
cataract
as
it
is
commonly
styled
in
the
maps
in
company
with
fifteen
boats
to
follow
and
rejoin
the
army
i
would
here
observe
that
what
is
called
the
second
cataract
is
properly
a
succession
of
partial
falls
and
swift
rapids
for
more
than
a
hundred
miles
before
we
arrived
at
succoot
i
counted
nine
some
of
them
particularly
the
second
fifth
seventh
and
ninth
very
dangerous
to
pass
though
at
this
time
the
nile
had
fallen
but
a
few
feet
before
we
arrived
at
the
fifth
two
boats
were
wrecked
against
the
rocks
which
crowd
the
rapids
and
one
filled
and
sunk
and
before
we
had
passed
the
ninth
several
similar
accidents
had
taken
place
to
pass
the
fifth
and
ninth
rapids
it
was
necessary
to
employ
about
a
hundred
men
to
drag
the
boats
one
after
another
against
the
current
at
the
fifth
pass
several
of
the
boats
were
damaged
and
two
soldiers
and
two
boatmen
drowned
at
this
pass
the
river
is
interrupted
by
a
ledge
of
rocks
reaching
nearly
across
and
over
which
the
nile
falls
between
this
ledge
of
rocks
and
the
western
shore
of
the
river
is
a
practicable
passage
wide
enough
to
admit
a
boat
to
be
hauled
up
the
current
which
here
runs
furiously
overlooking
this
passage
are
two
hills
one
on
the
east
and
one
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
on
these
hills
are
the
ruins
of
ancient
fortifications
they
are
also
surmounted
by
two
small
temples
in
the
egyptian
style
that
on
the
west
side
is
almost
perfect
it
is
sculptured
exteriorly
and
interiorly
with
figures
and
hieroglyphics
and
the
ceiling
is
painted
azure
the
appearance
of
the
country
on
each
side
of
the
falls
is
similar
to
that
of
the
country
south
of
assuan
a
sandy
desert
studded
with
rocky
hills
and
mountains
the
only
appearance
of
vegetation
observable
was
in
some
of
the
islands
and
on
the
immediate
banks
of
the
river
where
we
met
at
every
mile
or
two
with
small
spots
of
fertile
ground
some
of
them
cultivated
and
inhabited
the
rocky
hills
consist
frequently
of
beautiful
black
granite
of
the
color
and
brilliancy
of
the
best
here
and
there
at
different
points
on
the
cataract
i
observed
some
forts
built
by
the
natives
of
the
country
they
are
constructed
of
unhewn
stones
cemented
with
mud
and
flanked
by
towers
and
angular
projections
something
resembling
bastions
and
are
pierced
with
loopholes
for
musquetry
their
interior
presents
the
following
appearance
against
the
interior
side
of
the
walls
all
round
are
built
low
chambers
communicating
by
small
doors
with
the
area
and
frequently
with
each
other
i
could
observe
nothing
in
these
chambers
except
the
bottom
part
of
the
small
handmills
used
by
the
orientals
to
grind
meal
which
could
not
be
hastily
removed
as
they
were
fixed
in
the
ground
every
thing
else
the
inhabitants
had
carried
off
on
the
approach
of
the
army
the
great
area
in
the
centre
of
these
forts
appeared
to
have
been
occupied
by
the
camels
and
flocks
of
the
inhabitants
some
of
these
forts
are
to
be
seen
surmounting
the
high
rocky
islands
with
which
the
second
cataract
abounds
and
make
a
picturesque
appearance
on
the
of
the
moon
safa
we
passed
what
our
rais
erroneously
told
us
was
the
last
rapid
between
us
and
succoot
we
have
been
thirty
days
in
getting
thus
far
the
causes
of
our
having
been
so
long
in
getting
up
the
falls
were
several
the
crews
of
the
boats
which
had
passed
unhurt
a
dangerous
passage
were
frequently
detained
to
unload
and
repair
those
which
had
been
wrecked
or
we
have
been
detained
at
the
entrances
of
these
rapids
frequently
for
several
days
for
want
of
a
sufficient
wind
it
being
absolutely
necessary
that
the
wind
should
be
very
strong
to
enable
the
boats
to
force
themselves
through
currents
running
between
the
rocks
with
dreadful
rapidity
and
more
than
once
the
boatmen
have
hesitated
to
attempt
a
dangerous
pass
till
obliged
by
the
presence
and
menaces
of
the
divan
effendi
who
accompanied
the
boats
on
the
of
safa
about
an
hour
after
we
had
passed
what
our
rais
told
us
was
the
last
rapid
of
consequence
we
should
have
to
encounter
we
saw
the
wreck
of
a
boat
lying
against
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
river
her
masts
alone
appearing
out
of
the
water
the
river
here
is
interrupted
by
several
high
insulated
rocks
we
had
been
assured
that
we
should
now
find
the
river
open
and
without
difficulty
till
we
should
come
to
succoot
the
appearance
of
this
boat
seemed
to
contradict
this
representation
and
in
about
an
hour
after
we
had
abundant
reason
to
be
satisfied
that
it
was
false
i
was
congratulating
myself
that
we
had
got
into
smooth
water
and
indulging
myself
with
a
tranquil
pipe
of
tobacco
when
suddenly
the
wind
slackened
just
as
we
were
passing
between
two
ledges
of
rocks
where
the
river
was
running
at
the
rate
of
about
six
knots
an
hour
the
current
overpowered
the
effort
of
the
sails
and
carried
the
boat
directly
among
the
reefs
near
the
west
bank
of
the
river
after
remaining
for
about
ten
minutes
in
a
very
perilous
position
the
skill
of
our
rais
happily
got
the
boat
to
shore
without
injury
of
safa
we
remained
all
night
at
the
place
where
we
landed
in
the
morning
got
under
sail
to
pass
the
strong
current
we
had
attempted
yesterday
without
success
after
buffeting
about
for
an
hour
we
were
forced
to
return
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
await
a
stronger
wind
in
about
an
hour
after
the
wind
freshened
and
we
got
under
way
with
better
fortune
and
after
passing
the
current
before
mentioned
found
ourselves
in
smooth
water
after
sailing
for
an
hour
we
stopped
for
ten
minutes
at
a
place
where
we
saw
sheep
in
order
to
purchase
some
having
for
the
last
twenty
days
been
obliged
to
live
on
bread
rice
and
lentils
succeeded
in
purchasing
two
lambs
the
banks
of
the
river
hereabouts
present
some
fertile
spots
a
few
of
them
cultivated
about
noon
the
wind
fell
and
the
rais
put
to
shore
we
immediately
set
our
domestics
about
preparing
the
purchased
meat
and
shortly
after
we
sat
down
to
this
regale
which
appeared
to
me
the
most
delicious
meal
i
had
eaten
for
many
years
remained
here
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
of
safa
continued
in
the
same
place
there
not
being
sufficient
wind
to
ascend
the
river
about
two
hours
after
noon
arrived
an
arab
from
above
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
divan
effendi
who
was
a
few
miles
below
us
to
inform
him
that
a
boat
of
which
he
had
been
one
of
the
crew
had
been
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
in
attempting
to
pass
a
rapid
i
demanded
of
him
how
many
rapids
there
were
yet
ahead
he
replied
that
there
were
several
how
many
he
did
not
exactly
know
this
intelligence
made
me
apprehensive
that
we
might
be
another
month
in
getting
through
these
obstacles
and
determined
me
to
renew
my
efforts
to
obtain
camels
and
proceed
to
the
pasha
by
land
i
had
made
several
attempts
to
hire
some
for
this
purpose
during
the
last
fifteen
days
without
success
the
man
above
mentioned
informed
me
that
i
could
probably
obtain
some
at
a
village
about
six
hours
off
i
determined
to
send
my
servants
on
the
morrow
to
inquire
of
safa
passed
the
night
at
the
same
place
early
in
the
morning
a
favorable
breeze
sprung
up
and
the
rais
got
the
boat
under
sail
was
obliged
in
consequence
to
proceed
in
the
boat
as
long
as
the
wind
held
observed
as
we
proceeded
a
number
of
fertile
spots
some
of
them
cultivated
and
a
few
small
villages
i
was
informed
that
these
will
become
more
frequent
as
we
proceed
during
this
day
with
a
favorable
wind
made
only
about
twelve
miles
against
the
current
of
safa
got
under
way
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
with
a
strong
breeze
from
the
northward
about
half
an
hour
after
quitting
the
land
passed
a
dangerous
rapid
occasioned
by
reef
of
rocks
reaching
nearly
across
the
river
in
passing
this
rapid
the
wind
slackened
for
half
a
minute
and
the
current
carried
the
boat
astern
to
within
six
or
seven
feet
of
the
rocks
at
this
critical
instant
the
wind
happily
freshened
and
forced
the
boat
up
the
current
to
the
great
relief
of
all
on
board
an
hour
after
passed
a
picturesque
spot
where
the
river
is
divided
by
a
high
rocky
island
supporting
on
its
summit
some
ruined
fortifications
made
by
the
natives
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
just
opposite
is
a
fertile
spot
of
ground
and
a
village
surrounded
by
date
trees
and
plantations
our
rais
put
to
land
about
noon
the
wind
falling
and
rocks
and
rapids
of
formidable
appearance
being
right
ahead
we
have
made
about
eight
miles
saw
about
two
miles
above
us
a
number
of
boats
lying
to
the
shore
apparently
obstructed
by
the
rapid
just
mentioned
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
in
walking
along
the
shore
saw
a
crocodile
it
was
small
about
three
feet
in
length
when
i
came
upon
him
he
was
sunning
himself
on
the
shore
on
seeing
me
he
ran
with
great
rapidity
and
plunged
into
the
river
of
safa
got
under
way
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
to
pass
the
rocks
and
rapids
already
mentioned
the
passage
was
dangerous
and
the
boat
thrice
in
imminent
peril
we
struck
once
on
rocks
under
water
where
the
current
was
running
probably
at
the
rate
of
six
knots
an
hour
the
current
after
about
ten
minutes
swept
the
boat
off
without
having
received
a
hole
in
her
bottom
otherwise
we
must
probably
have
perished
shortly
after
we
were
jammed
between
a
great
shallow
whirlpool
and
a
large
boat
on
our
starboard
beam
this
boat
was
dashed
by
the
current
against
ours
and
menaced
to
shove
her
into
the
whirlpool
the
long
lateen
yards
of
the
two
boats
got
entangled
and
i
was
prepared
to
leap
into
the
other
boat
in
anticipation
of
the
destruction
of
ours
when
the
wind
freshened
and
the
large
boat
was
enabled
to
get
clear
of
ours
not
long
after
the
same
boat
fell
aboard
of
us
the
second
time
in
a
place
where
if
our
boat
had
drifted
twice
her
length
to
leeward
or
astern
she
must
have
run
upon
rocks
all
these
accidents
befell
us
having
under
our
eyes
at
no
great
distance
from
us
the
wreck
of
a
boat
lost
in
this
passage
three
or
four
days
ago
after
being
for
about
two
hours
in
danger
the
boat
arrived
at
the
west
bank
of
the
river
where
we
found
many
more
waiting
a
sufficient
wind
to
be
enabled
to
clear
the
remainder
of
the
rapid
which
runs
very
strong
here
stayed
for
a
wind
at
this
place
two
days
on
the
of
safa
the
boat
happily
passed
the
remainder
of
the
rapid
when
the
wind
calmed
and
the
rais
put
to
shore
there
being
yet
a
strong
current
to
surmount
opposite
to
the
place
where
we
were
at
about
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
a
boat
had
stuck
fast
upon
some
rocks
this
morning
all
attempts
to
get
her
off
had
proved
unsuccessful
and
she
remained
in
that
position
with
all
her
company
on
board
till
next
morning
of
safa
quitted
the
shore
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
with
a
fine
northerly
wind
passed
the
boat
just
mentioned
whose
people
looked
very
forlorn
some
small
boats
were
then
on
the
way
to
unload
this
boat
should
it
be
found
impossible
to
disengage
her
proceeded
on
our
way
and
passed
a
number
of
small
but
pretty
islands
lying
near
the
west
bank
of
the
river
they
are
cultivated
and
inhabited
by
a
considerable
population
the
country
on
the
borders
of
the
river
begins
to
assume
a
better
appearance
the
territory
of
succoot
which
we
were
now
entering
containing
many
villages
beyond
the
green
banks
of
the
river
all
is
yellow
desert
spotted
with
brown
rocky
mountains
which
however
appeared
to
decrease
in
number
and
height
as
we
advanced
up
the
river
till
the
country
subsided
into
a
plain
with
a
few
isolated
mountains
of
singular
forms
and
picturesque
appearance
here
and
there
in
view
about
two
hours
after
we
arrived
at
a
place
where
the
river
is
embarrassed
by
small
rocks
and
shoals
except
a
narrow
pass
on
the
western
side
we
found
the
current
here
too
strong
to
be
surmounted
by
the
aid
of
what
wind
we
had
and
therefore
put
to
shore
on
a
very
fine
island
on
our
left
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
here
with
satisfaction
this
island
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
naturally
beautiful
and
well
cultivated
by
about
fifty
or
sixty
inhabitants
who
seemed
to
be
well
contented
with
their
situation
we
saw
here
three
men
of
about
years
of
age
who
had
been
circumcised
but
five
days
past
a
thing
i
had
never
before
known
to
have
occurred
to
the
children
of
mussulmans
of
safa
at
an
early
hour
quitted
the
shore
with
a
strong
northerly
wind
to
pass
the
current
which
had
stopped
us
yesterday
this
day
sail
was
the
most
agreeable
of
any
we
had
enjoyed
since
we
left
egypt
the
river
since
we
had
passed
the
rapids
of
dall
where
the
second
cataract
of
the
nile
properly
commences
having
become
as
broad
as
in
egypt
and
now
flowing
tranquilly
through
a
country
equally
fertile
and
much
more
picturesque
than
the
finest
parts
of
said
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
particularly
presented
a
continual
succession
of
villages
and
fine
soil
crowded
with
trees
and
all
cultivated
passed
during
the
day
some
fine
and
large
islands
also
occupied
by
numerous
villages
we
stopped
at
night
at
one
of
these
islands
by
whose
beautiful
borders
we
had
been
sailing
with
great
pleasure
for
more
than
four
hours
with
a
stiff
breeze
we
were
in
formed
by
the
inhabitants
that
this
island
was
a
day
walk
in
breadth
they
said
that
as
we
advanced
we
should
find
others
as
large
and
larger
their
island
they
told
us
was
called
syee
they
appeared
to
be
well
satisfied
with
their
condition
having
an
abundance
of
every
thing
absolutely
needful
for
a
comfortable
subsistence
and
decent
clothing
of
their
own
manufacture
what
surprised
me
not
a
little
was
to
find
the
people
as
white
as
the
arabs
of
lower
egypt
whereas
the
inhabitants
of
nubia
are
quite
black
though
their
features
are
not
those
of
the
negro
i
have
observed
that
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
as
fertile
and
much
more
picturesque
than
the
said
the
reason
for
the
latter
part
of
this
assertion
is
that
in
the
said
the
view
is
limited
by
the
ridges
of
barren
and
calcined
mountains
that
bound
it
on
both
sides
whereas
here
the
view
ranges
over
plains
bounded
only
by
the
horizon
and
interspersed
here
and
there
with
isolated
mountains
of
most
singular
forms
some
of
them
might
be
mistaken
for
pyramids
they
are
so
regular
and
well
defined
some
resembled
lofty
cones
and
others
resembled
lofty
square
or
pentagonal
redoubts
one
of
the
latter
description
lies
upon
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
and
could
easily
be
made
an
impregnable
fortress
which
could
command
all
water
communication
between
egypt
and
dongola
the
scenes
of
verdure
and
cultivation
through
which
we
had
passed
today
removed
all
suspicions
from
my
mind
as
to
what
had
been
reported
to
me
of
the
great
difference
between
nubia
and
the
country
beyond
it
all
the
villages
we
have
passed
have
in
their
centre
a
fort
or
castle
fortified
with
towers
at
the
corners
and
judging
from
those
we
visited
resembling
in
their
interior
those
on
the
cataract
already
described
the
village
consisting
of
low
huts
built
of
mud
is
built
round
the
walls
of
the
fort
which
is
intended
to
serve
as
a
place
of
retreat
and
defense
for
the
inhabitants
and
their
flocks
in
case
of
alarm
or
attack
they
are
governed
in
the
manner
of
the
families
of
the
patriarchs
the
sheck
of
the
village
being
both
judge
and
captain
saw
at
this
island
a
small
skiff
the
first
boat
belonging
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
that
i
have
seen
since
quitting
wady
halfa
of
safa
parted
from
the
land
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
which
was
if
possible
still
more
agreeable
than
that
of
yesterday
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
the
eye
rests
on
a
continued
succession
of
villages
occupying
land
of
the
finest
quality
and
lying
under
a
continued
forest
of
palm
trees
larger
and
taller
in
my
opinion
than
those
growing
in
egypt
on
the
right
we
saw
as
we
passed
a
chain
of
beautiful
islands
some
of
them
large
and
presenting
the
same
spectacle
as
the
east
bank
it
is
certainly
a
beautiful
country
the
river
from
assuan
has
only
about
half
the
breadth
that
it
has
in
egypt
in
this
country
it
is
as
broad
and
in
many
places
on
account
of
the
large
islands
it
here
contains
very
much
broader
than
it
is
in
egypt
we
stopped
at
night
at
one
of
these
fine
islands
whose
breadth
being
but
about
two
miles
enabled
us
to
have
a
view
of
the
west
bank
of
the
river
which
presented
the
same
succession
of
villages
and
cultivation
as
on
the
oriental
side
i
have
already
observed
that
the
date
trees
of
this
country
were
larger
and
taller
than
those
in
egypt
we
found
a
similar
difference
in
the
animals
of
this
country
i
purchased
a
sucking
lamb
which
was
certainly
as
big
as
an
egyptian
sheep
of
a
year
growth
the
cattle
of
this
country
differ
from
those
of
egypt
in
bearing
as
to
form
a
resemblance
to
the
buffalo
they
have
a
rising
on
the
shoulder
and
a
similar
form
of
the
hips
they
are
also
larger
than
the
cows
of
egypt
of
safa
the
wind
did
not
spring
up
this
morning
till
a
late
hour
and
after
continuing
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
fell
calm
we
put
to
shore
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
where
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
night
the
country
continued
fine
and
crowded
with
villages
at
this
place
some
of
the
boat
company
attempted
to
shoot
a
hippopotamus
who
had
shown
himself
several
times
during
the
day
they
succeeded
only
in
slightly
wounding
him
after
which
he
disappeared
the
people
of
the
country
say
that
there
are
twelve
that
frequent
this
place
in
the
river
which
contains
here
some
low
islands
well
adapted
to
afford
them
food
and
concealment
of
safa
parted
from
the
land
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
with
a
strong
breeze
after
continuing
an
hour
and
a
half
the
wind
subsided
into
a
calm
which
obliged
us
to
make
for
the
shore
we
landed
on
a
large
island
resembling
those
already
mentioned
where
we
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
night
the
country
we
had
passed
resembled
that
below
beautiful
and
as
fertile
as
land
can
be
of
safa
left
the
land
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
and
in
half
an
hour
passed
the
southern
boundary
of
the
beautiful
territory
of
succoot
and
entered
the
province
of
machass
the
country
we
were
now
passing
is
naturally
fertile
but
has
not
such
a
continued
succession
of
villages
as
succoot
about
three
hours
after
sunrise
came
in
view
of
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
temple
on
the
west
bank
with
some
difficulty
engaged
the
rais
to
put
to
shore
for
a
few
minutes
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
visiting
it
this
temple
is
manifestly
of
egyptian
architecture
it
is
about
two
hundred
feet
long
from
east
to
west
ten
of
the
columns
only
are
standing
they
are
composed
of
separate
blocks
of
a
brown
stone
resembling
that
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
temples
in
the
isle
of
philoe
the
walls
of
this
temple
are
in
ruins
except
a
part
of
the
front
which
is
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
the
front
faces
the
east
the
pillars
and
the
ruins
of
the
walls
are
sculptured
with
hieroglyphics
it
stands
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
about
two
miles
beyond
the
territory
of
succoot
about
an
hour
after
leaving
this
place
the
wind
falling
our
rais
was
obliged
to
put
to
shore
we
soon
arrived
at
the
western
bank
of
the
river
the
nile
being
in
this
place
not
a
mile
broad
the
remainder
of
the
day
being
calm
we
staid
here
till
next
morning
several
of
the
pasha
cavalry
passed
along
the
west
bank
of
the
river
yesterday
and
bearing
repeated
orders
from
dongola
to
the
commanders
of
the
boats
to
hasten
their
progress
of
safa
at
an
early
hour
started
with
a
favorable
wind
but
in
about
two
hours
were
obliged
to
put
to
shore
the
river
hereabouts
makes
several
turns
almost
at
right
angles
with
each
other
this
circumstance
brought
the
wind
directly
ahead
in
one
of
the
bends
and
obliged
us
to
remain
there
till
next
morning
the
country
we
saw
is
not
equal
to
the
territory
of
succoot
the
date
trees
the
villages
and
the
cultivation
are
not
so
continued
and
the
view
from
the
river
is
bounded
at
a
little
distance
from
its
banks
by
low
rocky
hills
saw
a
singular
mode
of
navigating
the
river
a
man
who
apparently
was
traveling
down
the
river
with
his
whole
family
had
placed
his
youngest
wife
and
her
two
young
children
on
a
small
raft
made
of
bundles
of
lashed
together
he
himself
swam
by
its
side
to
guide
it
while
he
kept
his
old
wife
a
swimming
and
pushing
it
by
the
stern
and
in
this
way
they
proceeded
down
the
river
i
have
seen
in
this
country
small
rafts
made
to
carry
one
person
which
are
very
well
contrived
three
or
four
large
empty
gourds
are
fastened
firmly
to
a
small
oblong
frame
made
out
of
the
branches
of
the
date
tree
the
whole
not
weighing
two
pounds
a
man
may
go
safely
down
or
across
the
river
on
this
either
by
fastening
it
to
his
breast
and
swimming
supported
by
it
or
by
riding
on
it
astride
and
when
on
shore
he
can
carry
it
with
ease
either
in
his
hand
or
on
his
shoulder
of
safa
in
the
morning
found
that
the
wind
had
changed
a
little
in
our
favor
got
under
way
but
after
sailing
for
about
two
hours
the
winding
of
the
river
again
brought
it
ahead
put
to
shore
and
staid
there
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
the
wind
again
hauled
a
little
in
our
favor
and
with
some
difficulty
we
got
to
windward
of
the
shore
and
proceeded
up
the
river
the
river
here
is
about
half
a
mile
broad
and
makes
several
turns
which
somewhat
retarded
our
progress
we
observed
some
rocks
and
shoals
and
on
arriving
at
a
place
where
the
river
is
divided
by
a
large
rocky
island
observed
a
boat
aground
which
had
taken
the
right
hand
passage
which
was
the
broadest
and
two
others
turning
back
to
take
the
passage
on
the
other
side
of
this
island
we
followed
their
example
and
found
the
passage
safe
enough
a
little
beyond
the
upper
end
of
this
island
the
river
makes
an
acute
angle
to
the
right
hand
we
proceeded
onwards
till
sunset
when
we
put
to
shore
in
company
with
two
other
boats
the
country
we
have
passed
through
resembled
that
we
saw
yesterday
inferior
to
the
fine
territory
of
succoot
of
safa
left
the
land
an
hour
and
a
half
after
sunrise
with
a
fine
breeze
from
the
north
sailed
for
about
an
hour
through
a
country
where
the
rocky
hills
come
down
here
and
there
close
to
the
river
banks
and
narrowed
the
usual
breadth
of
the
nile
considerably
observed
however
in
this
tract
of
country
a
few
fine
and
cultivated
islands
shortly
after
the
river
widened
the
rocky
hills
retired
at
a
distance
and
the
eye
rested
with
pleasure
on
a
beautiful
country
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
continued
succession
of
villages
and
castles
which
occupied
both
banks
of
the
river
the
country
resembled
the
province
of
succoot
except
that
the
date
trees
were
not
so
numerous
nor
so
tall
and
large
passed
the
ruins
of
a
considerable
fortified
town
situated
on
a
high
hill
on
the
west
bank
a
little
beyond
this
place
saw
the
ruins
of
a
temple
four
of
the
columns
are
yet
standing
could
not
go
ashore
to
examine
it
as
the
wind
was
fair
and
strong
and
the
rais
under
positive
orders
to
proceed
with
all
expedition
observed
that
several
of
the
castles
we
had
passed
yesterday
and
appeared
newer
and
better
constructed
for
defense
than
those
we
had
seen
along
the
cataract
i
suspect
that
they
were
erected
under
the
direction
of
the
exiled
mamalukes
as
this
tract
forms
a
part
of
the
territory
subject
to
them
before
the
arrival
of
the
pasha
ismael
continued
to
advance
through
a
country
very
beautiful
the
river
here
embosoming
several
large
and
delightful
islands
capable
of
being
made
by
the
hands
of
enlightened
industry
every
thing
that
the
art
of
man
operating
upon
a
fine
soil
under
a
soft
climate
could
effect
we
sailed
pleasantly
by
these
charming
shores
and
islands
till
an
hour
and
a
half
before
sunset
when
we
came
in
view
of
a
rapid
ahead
and
the
wreck
of
a
boat
lost
in
passing
it
the
rais
put
to
shore
and
after
taking
on
board
a
native
of
the
country
to
show
him
the
passage
through
the
rocks
and
shallows
attempted
to
pass
immediately
the
effort
was
unsuccessful
after
remaining
in
the
foaming
passage
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
found
that
the
wind
was
not
strong
enough
to
force
the
boat
through
the
current
and
as
the
sun
was
about
setting
and
the
wind
falling
the
rais
was
obliged
to
let
the
boat
drift
back
to
the
shore
from
whence
we
had
departed
of
safa
at
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
the
rais
thought
the
wind
sufficiently
favorable
and
strong
to
carry
the
boat
through
the
rapid
we
quitted
the
shore
and
again
faced
the
current
the
rais
this
time
was
not
mistaken
our
boat
forced
her
way
slowly
but
victoriously
through
the
torrent
and
in
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
carried
us
safely
into
smooth
water
where
we
could
draw
every
advantage
from
a
fine
wind
which
swept
us
rapidly
up
the
river
between
shores
fertile
and
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
continued
succession
of
villages
shaded
by
palm
trees
about
an
hour
after
we
had
passed
the
rapid
we
stopped
to
receive
on
board
three
of
our
company
who
had
left
the
boat
yesterday
in
search
of
fresh
provisions
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
they
reported
that
they
had
seen
a
large
pond
of
fresh
water
inland
and
had
found
the
country
for
seven
miles
from
the
river
crowded
with
villages
and
as
fertile
as
possible
they
represented
that
this
country
was
watered
by
two
ranges
of
one
range
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
threw
the
water
of
the
nile
into
small
canals
leading
to
reservoirs
inland
from
whence
the
other
range
took
it
up
and
distributed
it
to
this
fine
territory
about
noon
we
passed
on
the
east
bank
two
very
high
large
and
isolated
rocks
of
irregular
and
picturesque
forms
on
the
side
of
the
southernmost
were
the
remains
of
a
considerable
fortified
town
the
country
hereabouts
is
very
beautiful
about
three
we
passed
another
rapid
which
was
not
however
very
difficult
found
the
river
beyond
this
place
much
narrowed
and
impeded
by
rocks
passed
two
more
rapids
the
first
of
little
consequence
but
the
latter
somewhat
dangerous
in
this
last
rapid
saw
two
boys
sitting
on
a
raft
made
of
cornstalks
lashed
together
and
driving
down
the
current
they
appeared
to
be
much
at
their
ease
and
not
at
all
alarmed
at
the
rapid
though
the
current
frequently
whirled
their
fragile
raft
round
and
round
as
it
rushed
past
us
soon
after
passing
this
rapid
the
sun
set
and
we
put
to
shore
to
pass
the
night
of
safa
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
we
left
the
shore
with
a
fair
and
fresh
breeze
the
river
here
is
broad
and
the
country
on
both
banks
fertile
and
peopled
after
about
an
hour
sail
we
came
up
with
some
beautiful
islands
one
of
them
very
large
and
among
the
finest
we
had
seen
the
islands
above
the
second
cataract
are
probably
the
most
beautiful
spots
watered
by
the
nile
which
rarely
over
flows
them
they
are
the
most
populous
and
best
cultivated
parts
of
this
country
half
an
hour
after
we
came
up
with
the
large
island
the
wind
became
squally
and
the
boat
could
not
make
safe
progress
our
rais
therefore
put
to
shore
as
did
those
of
five
other
boats
in
company
with
ours
we
remained
here
for
the
rest
of
the
day
of
safa
in
the
morning
left
the
laud
with
the
wind
almost
ahead
after
sailing
about
three
miles
the
rais
found
it
necessary
to
put
to
shore
as
the
wind
was
strong
and
too
much
ahead
stayed
by
the
land
till
nearly
noon
when
the
wind
appearing
to
me
and
others
on
board
more
favorable
we
after
some
hard
words
with
the
rais
persuaded
him
to
get
under
way
the
wind
being
about
the
same
as
in
the
morning
and
very
strong
in
about
an
hour
we
arrived
at
a
bend
in
the
river
which
enabled
us
to
bring
the
wind
aft
we
proceeded
with
great
rapidity
threading
the
rocks
and
shoals
with
which
the
river
here
abounds
till
we
came
in
view
of
a
rapid
ahead
we
had
been
informed
two
days
ago
that
there
was
a
dangerous
rapid
between
us
and
dongola
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
the
wind
was
fair
and
strong
to
push
us
through
it
we
passed
it
happily
though
not
without
peril
we
felicitated
ourselves
on
having
cleared
the
only
obstacle
as
we
supposed
between
us
and
the
place
of
our
destination
when
we
came
in
view
of
another
of
a
more
formidable
appearance
than
any
we
had
yet
seen
the
passage
lay
where
the
river
rolled
furiously
over
rocks
under
water
and
between
shores
there
was
no
approaching
on
account
of
the
shoals
and
rocks
above
and
under
water
which
lined
them
the
strong
wind
forced
our
boat
alongside
of
another
that
was
struggling
and
reeling
in
the
passage
to
the
imminent
danger
of
both
to
clear
this
boat
our
rais
ventured
to
pass
ours
over
a
place
where
the
foam
and
fury
of
the
water
indicated
latent
rocks
we
hardly
dared
to
breathe
but
we
did
not
strike
here
but
half
a
minute
after
we
were
fast
upon
a
sand
bank
we
stayed
in
this
condition
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
having
in
view
close
by
us
the
wreck
of
a
boat
lost
here
with
considerable
difficulty
our
boat
was
disengaged
when
we
put
her
before
the
wind
and
again
faced
this
truly
infernal
pass
by
the
force
of
the
current
the
boat
neared
a
large
and
furious
whirlpool
formed
by
an
eddy
on
the
side
of
the
passage
the
steersman
endeavored
in
vain
to
counteract
this
drift
of
the
boat
by
the
aid
of
the
rudder
the
side
of
the
boat
approached
to
within
a
yard
of
the
white
foam
which
covered
this
dreadful
spot
our
rais
tore
his
turban
from
his
head
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
to
heaven
exclaiming
we
are
lost
the
rest
of
the
boatmen
were
screaming
to
god
and
the
prophet
for
aid
when
i
know
not
how
but
by
the
good
providence
that
watched
over
us
the
boat
cleared
this
peril
and
others
that
beset
us
in
passing
yet
two
more
rapids
almost
as
dangerous
on
passing
the
last
we
found
the
river
divided
lengthways
by
a
ridge
of
rocks
and
low
islands
covered
with
verdure
on
the
right
or
west
side
of
this
ridge
where
we
were
the
view
ahead
presented
our
side
of
the
river
crowded
with
rocks
which
we
could
not
pass
the
singular
ridge
already
mentioned
presented
however
some
gaps
which
afforded
passages
into
that
part
of
the
river
that
was
on
the
other
side
of
this
ridge
we
passed
through
what
appeared
to
us
the
safest
of
these
gaps
and
soon
after
found
ourselves
in
smooth
but
shallow
water
the
river
hereabouts
being
not
less
than
five
or
six
miles
broad
and
spotted
with
rocks
and
little
green
islands
and
ridges
soon
after
a
boat
ahead
grounded
and
stuck
fast
for
some
time
about
five
minutes
after
our
boat
received
a
violent
shock
from
a
rock
under
water
the
rais
put
the
boat
under
her
foresail
only
in
order
that
in
case
she
struck
it
might
be
with
as
little
force
as
possible
shortly
after
it
being
about
an
hour
before
sunset
the
rais
put
to
shore
to
inquire
of
the
people
of
the
country
as
to
the
condition
of
the
river
ahead
the
country
we
saw
this
day
on
both
sides
of
the
river
is
a
level
plain
only
one
hill
was
visible
the
shores
and
many
of
the
islands
we
passed
were
such
as
we
should
have
contemplated
with
greater
pleasure
if
we
could
have
employed
our
eyes
and
thoughts
upon
any
thing
beside
the
perils
by
which
we
were
environed
they
are
fertile
verdant
and
in
many
places
truly
picturesque
we
put
to
shore
this
day
as
said
before
about
an
hour
before
sunset
when
we
disembarked
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
large
and
beautiful
island
almost
covered
with
trees
of
various
kinds
the
view
from
this
island
ranges
over
an
immense
green
plain
bounded
only
by
the
horizon
and
presents
a
great
river
winding
in
several
branches
through
islands
and
shores
composed
of
as
fine
a
soil
as
any
in
the
world
and
covered
with
trees
among
which
the
date
tree
bore
a
small
proportion
dongola
we
were
told
was
but
a
few
hours
distant
from
this
place
of
safa
at
sunrise
quitted
the
land
and
proceeded
up
the
river
which
we
found
very
wide
and
shallow
its
middle
was
occupied
by
an
almost
continual
range
of
islands
in
my
opinion
without
superior
in
any
river
whatever
the
country
bounding
the
river
is
a
beautiful
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
as
fertile
as
land
can
be
and
covered
with
a
great
variety
of
trees
plants
and
fields
of
corn
we
sailed
on
with
a
fair
wind
till
within
half
an
hour
of
sunset
without
coming
in
sight
of
dongola
this
after
the
information
we
had
received
yesterday
somewhat
disappointed
us
but
we
consoled
ourselves
by
observing
the
islands
and
shores
we
were
passing
comparable
to
which
in
point
of
luxuriant
fertility
egypt
itself
can
not
show
the
whole
country
is
absolutely
overwhelmed
with
the
products
of
the
very
rich
soil
of
which
it
consists
of
safa
quitted
the
land
at
an
early
hour
and
proceeded
up
the
river
in
hourly
expectation
of
coming
in
view
of
dongola
which
we
had
been
given
to
understand
was
a
considerable
town
after
sailing
with
a
good
wind
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
without
seeing
any
thing
but
a
very
fertile
country
resembling
that
we
passed
yesterday
the
people
on
shore
on
our
landing
and
demanding
whereabouts
dongola
was
informed
us
that
we
were
in
dongola
meaning
the
country
so
called
on
our
asking
where
was
the
city
or
town
of
dongola
they
pointed
to
a
large
village
in
the
distance
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
and
told
us
that
village
was
called
new
dongola
and
that
old
dongola
was
farther
up
the
river
they
informed
us
that
the
pasha
had
left
a
guard
of
soldiers
here
and
had
proceeded
with
the
army
three
days
march
farther
up
the
river
where
we
should
find
him
we
determined
to
proceed
to
his
encampment
we
saw
for
the
first
time
a
small
sail
boat
constructed
by
the
people
of
the
country
it
was
very
clumsy
resembling
a
log
canoe
the
river
in
some
places
which
we
passed
appeared
to
be
about
three
miles
from
bank
to
bank
but
shallow
the
islands
and
shores
presenting
the
same
spectacle
of
luxuriant
vegetation
that
we
saw
yesterday
we
bought
a
lamb
of
three
weeks
old
this
evening
whose
mother
was
as
tall
as
a
calf
of
two
months
old
this
species
of
sheep
is
hairy
and
has
no
wool
the
kidneys
of
this
lamb
were
large
enough
to
cover
the
palm
of
my
hand
though
the
animal
was
undoubtedly
undiseased
of
safa
got
under
way
shortly
after
sunrise
and
proceeded
up
the
river
with
a
fine
wind
which
lasted
during
the
day
and
carried
us
probably
thirty
miles
on
our
way
the
country
through
which
we
passed
is
not
so
good
as
that
we
saw
yesterday
the
desert
comes
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
in
several
places
we
saw
many
villages
but
for
the
last
two
days
have
observed
none
of
those
castles
so
frequent
in
the
lower
country
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
we
quitted
the
land
passed
a
fortified
town
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
which
appeared
to
be
mostly
in
ruins
on
our
landing
at
night
we
endeavored
to
purchase
some
provisions
but
the
people
of
the
country
could
only
spare
us
some
milk
and
vegetables
for
which
they
would
not
take
money
but
demanded
flour
on
our
consenting
to
this
proposition
they
brought
us
an
abundance
of
the
articles
above
mentioned
they
informed
us
that
there
was
a
town
called
dongola
containing
about
three
hundred
houses
at
the
distance
of
two
days
sail
from
this
place
and
that
the
pasha
was
encamped
three
days
march
in
advance
of
dongola
of
safa
left
the
shore
this
morning
shortly
after
sunrise
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
the
country
we
passed
through
this
day
was
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
fine
but
on
the
east
bank
the
desert
was
visible
at
a
little
distance
from
the
river
almost
all
the
day
passed
two
considerable
fortified
towns
situated
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
they
were
almost
in
ruins
an
hour
before
sunset
we
put
to
shore
on
the
west
bank
where
we
found
a
fertile
and
cultivated
country
the
people
who
occupied
it
said
that
they
had
settled
here
a
year
ago
the
island
they
had
occupied
before
having
been
overflowed
by
the
river
and
their
plantations
destroyed
of
safa
this
day
made
but
little
progress
there
having
been
a
calm
for
more
than
half
the
day
what
country
we
saw
resembled
that
passed
yesterday
of
safa
remained
fast
by
the
shore
for
the
whole
of
this
day
the
wind
being
ahead
the
country
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
where
we
stopped
is
fine
but
deserted
by
the
inhabitants
some
of
the
company
who
went
up
the
country
in
search
of
provisions
reported
that
they
had
seen
the
ruins
of
a
temple
containing
fragments
of
columns
of
black
granite
i
determined
in
case
the
wind
on
the
morrow
should
continue
unfavorable
to
visit
this
place
they
also
had
met
a
party
of
fifteen
armed
men
who
informed
them
that
they
belonged
to
this
country
but
had
been
compelled
to
quit
it
and
fly
by
the
brigands
of
shageia
who
had
infested
and
ravaged
the
country
but
had
returned
on
hearing
that
the
pasha
ismael
had
defeated
and
expelled
these
robbers
and
had
invited
every
fugitive
peasant
to
return
home
giving
them
assurance
of
future
safety
and
protection
we
were
alarmed
this
evening
by
the
report
of
several
musket
shot
which
appeared
to
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
we
had
been
told
still
lurked
some
of
the
brigands
prepared
our
arms
to
be
ready
in
case
of
attack
but
passed
the
night
unmolested
of
safa
early
in
the
morning
quitted
the
shore
with
a
fair
wind
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
dongola
being
we
were
told
but
half
a
day
distance
from
us
the
appearance
of
the
country
still
the
same
of
safa
made
but
little
way
today
the
wind
being
light
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
put
to
shore
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
as
there
appeared
to
be
no
villages
in
sight
on
the
other
shore
and
we
were
in
want
of
provisions
the
country
we
saw
is
very
good
and
covered
with
trees
but
sparely
inhabited
the
country
where
we
landed
was
however
tolerably
well
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
several
villages
hereabouts
the
soil
where
it
was
not
cultivated
was
completely
covered
with
trees
generally
of
no
great
height
and
with
bushes
and
long
rank
grass
the
habitations
of
many
of
the
inhabitants
could
with
difficulty
be
found
they
are
frequently
nothing
but
a
rough
arbor
formed
in
the
thickets
we
had
continual
reason
to
be
surprised
that
a
country
naturally
so
rich
should
be
so
thinly
populated
and
so
carelessly
cultivated
the
people
however
appeared
to
be
content
with
raising
enough
for
their
subsistence
and
to
desire
nothing
beyond
this
our
money
they
did
not
value
they
would
give
us
nothing
for
money
but
the
flour
of
egypt
readily
obtained
what
they
could
spare
of
safa
at
sunrise
left
the
land
with
a
fair
and
strong
wind
and
proceeded
up
the
river
with
rapidity
in
about
two
hours
passed
what
appeared
to
be
the
ruins
of
a
large
fortified
city
situated
on
a
commanding
eminence
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
shortly
after
put
to
shore
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
the
wind
having
increased
to
a
gale
and
the
east
side
towards
the
city
just
mentioned
being
inaccessible
on
account
of
the
shoals
that
lined
it
the
violence
of
the
wind
forced
the
boat
aground
upon
a
shallow
at
the
entrance
of
a
canal
here
the
only
one
i
had
seen
for
a
month
after
toiling
for
an
hour
the
boatmen
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
the
boat
about
an
hour
after
noon
the
wind
abated
and
the
boat
proceeded
on
her
way
under
her
foresail
only
we
went
at
a
great
rate
till
an
hour
before
sunset
when
we
put
to
shore
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
the
people
informed
us
that
we
had
passed
dongola
and
from
their
description
of
that
place
we
were
convinced
that
the
city
we
had
seen
this
morning
upon
the
eminence
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
must
have
been
the
place
we
were
bound
to
the
people
said
that
all
the
boats
that
preceded
us
had
followed
the
march
of
the
army
of
the
pasha
who
was
encamped
they
reported
at
two
days
distance
from
this
place
we
therefore
determined
to
proceed
to
join
him
and
not
to
return
to
dongola
where
it
was
probable
we
should
only
receive
directions
to
proceed
to
the
pasha
the
country
we
saw
was
not
so
uniformly
fertile
as
that
we
have
passed
for
several
days
past
sand
was
in
some
places
visible
of
rebi
made
great
way
the
wind
being
very
strong
till
sunset
we
landed
at
evening
on
a
large
and
fertile
island
which
was
well
cultivated
i
observed
here
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
place
where
we
landed
a
large
and
lofty
column
situated
as
i
then
supposed
on
the
main
land
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
the
country
we
passed
for
about
ten
miles
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
is
mostly
covered
by
sand
that
on
the
western
bank
is
beautiful
during
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
however
the
country
we
passed
on
both
banks
can
be
surpassed
by
none
in
the
world
for
fertility
the
appearance
of
numerous
and
large
plantations
of
durra
and
cotton
showed
us
that
this
fine
territory
was
improved
by
a
considerable
population
the
face
of
the
country
continues
still
the
same
an
immense
and
fertile
plain
bounded
by
the
horizon
and
intersected
by
the
windings
of
the
river
nile
we
have
seen
no
considerable
eminence
for
many
days
except
that
on
which
stands
the
old
city
of
dongola
which
we
passed
yesterday
it
is
a
fine
military
position
of
rebi
the
wind
was
right
ahead
owing
to
the
curious
fact
that
the
river
here
makes
an
eccentric
bend
to
the
left
toward
the
and
presents
itself
as
coming
from
that
quarter
instead
of
from
the
south
or
as
usual
hitherto
the
rais
attempted
to
advance
by
cordelling
the
boat
but
the
force
of
the
wind
and
current
prevented
the
boatmen
from
gaining
more
than
two
or
three
miles
along
the
coast
of
the
island
where
we
landed
yesterday
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
pass
a
great
part
of
this
day
and
all
night
by
the
shore
the
island
is
about
twenty
miles
long
and
very
beautiful
it
is
called
as
i
have
been
repeatedly
informed
argo
of
rebi
we
were
obliged
still
to
continue
fast
by
the
shore
till
noon
when
the
wind
abating
the
boat
advanced
about
two
miles
by
the
help
of
the
cordel
so
far
as
to
arrive
at
a
small
bend
in
the
river
which
brought
the
wind
a
little
in
our
favor
so
as
to
pass
by
its
aid
to
the
other
side
in
the
hope
if
the
wind
continued
the
same
on
the
morrow
to
profit
by
it
and
proceed
we
arrived
a
little
before
sun
set
and
remained
there
for
the
night
we
saw
this
day
while
the
boat
was
warping
slowly
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
ruins
of
a
considerable
fortified
town
built
of
stone
and
encompassed
by
large
cemeteries
some
large
columns
of
a
beautiful
stone
white
intermixed
red
are
to
be
seen
among
the
ruins
one
of
the
cemeteries
is
evidently
ancient
as
the
tombs
are
covered
with
hieroglyphics
intermixed
with
inscriptions
in
one
of
the
tombs
one
of
our
party
found
the
remains
of
a
mummy
of
rebi
made
but
little
progress
on
account
of
the
irregularity
in
the
river
already
mentioned
which
makes
its
course
hereabouts
almost
the
direct
contrary
to
its
natural
direction
and
brings
in
consequence
the
prevalent
winds
ahead
passed
some
small
but
fine
islands
and
saw
for
the
first
time
for
several
days
stone
mountains
in
the
distance
the
shores
of
the
river
hereabouts
are
fertile
but
thinly
inhabited
saw
several
large
villages
in
ruins
of
rebi
the
wind
and
the
untoward
direction
of
the
river
obliged
us
again
to
employ
the
cordel
to
forward
the
boat
a
few
miles
more
on
her
way
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
had
arrived
at
a
place
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
that
had
been
a
few
days
ago
the
scene
of
a
battle
between
the
pasha
and
the
brigands
of
shageia
we
found
there
a
strong
and
well
built
castle
at
the
farther
extremity
of
a
high
and
long
mountain
running
nearly
at
right
angles
with
the
river
and
which
approached
to
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
its
bank
thus
furnishing
a
fine
position
to
the
enemy
the
castle
was
taken
by
the
aid
of
the
pasha
artillery
and
his
cavalry
rode
through
and
dispersed
all
who
fought
outside
of
it
this
castle
was
astonishingly
welt
arranged
in
its
interior
and
was
thereby
rendered
very
comfortable
quarters
for
a
considerable
garrison
the
country
in
the
vicinity
contains
many
villages
and
was
covered
with
plantations
of
durra
beans
and
fields
of
cotton
these
villages
had
been
ransacked
and
in
part
destroyed
by
the
victorious
troops
as
the
inhabitants
instead
of
coming
in
to
the
pasha
as
did
the
people
of
the
lower
countries
had
taken
up
arms
and
sided
with
the
brigands
who
lorded
it
over
the
country
we
learned
however
that
they
did
this
much
against
their
will
being
compelled
thereto
by
their
marauding
masters
i
was
informed
today
that
some
english
travelers
were
in
one
of
the
boats
ahead
i
determined
in
case
the
wind
should
continue
unfavorable
tomorrow
to
walk
up
the
river
and
pay
them
a
visit
of
rebi
set
out
very
early
in
the
morning
it
being
dead
calm
and
the
boat
in
consequence
unable
to
proceed
except
by
the
cordel
to
see
the
strangers
and
to
be
informed
of
their
accommodations
as
i
feared
that
they
too
were
obliged
to
participate
in
the
privations
to
which
we
were
all
exposed
after
about
two
hours
walk
at
length
came
up
with
the
boat
on
board
of
which
these
gentlemen
were
they
informed
me
that
they
had
set
out
from
cairo
a
few
days
after
we
had
quitted
bulac
they
were
suffering
privations
as
were
all
in
the
boats
and
i
regretted
that
my
being
in
similar
circumstances
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
ameliorate
their
situation
as
however
we
had
now
learned
to
a
certainty
that
the
camp
of
the
pasha
was
not
far
distant
it
was
in
my
power
to
assure
them
that
they
would
be
better
off
in
a
day
or
two
all
the
way
to
their
boat
and
on
my
return
to
ours
i
observed
some
hundreds
of
bodies
of
men
and
animals
that
had
perished
in
the
late
engagement
and
during
the
pursuit
and
the
stench
which
filled
the
air
was
almost
intolerable
the
country
covered
with
an
abundance
of
grain
almost
matured
was
abandoned
the
stood
still
and
the
cisterns
were
frequently
infected
by
a
bloody
and
putrefying
carcass
of
rebi
passed
the
last
night
on
board
the
boat
near
the
mountain
already
mentioned
in
the
day
before
yesterday
journal
two
greeks
on
board
of
our
boat
reported
last
evening
that
they
had
heard
menacing
cries
from
the
mountain
the
people
on
board
of
the
boat
supposed
that
some
of
the
brigands
had
returned
to
their
haunt
and
meditated
an
attack
on
our
boat
by
night
we
were
accordingly
on
the
watch
till
morning
without
however
being
molested
this
morning
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
these
same
greeks
reported
that
they
had
seen
fifteen
or
sixteen
of
the
robbers
in
a
body
and
armed
they
also
told
the
mogrebin
soldiers
in
the
other
boats
which
had
now
come
up
with
ours
that
these
men
had
probably
massacred
one
of
the
soldiers
attached
to
me
and
two
of
my
servants
as
they
had
not
been
seen
since
morning
i
accordingly
set
out
in
company
with
twenty
soldiers
in
pursuit
of
the
supposed
assassins
we
had
not
proceeded
far
when
we
met
the
persons
supposed
killed
on
their
way
to
our
boat
safe
and
sound
they
had
seen
no
armed
men
though
they
came
from
the
direction
that
the
greeks
said
the
robbers
had
taken
i
therefore
returned
to
the
boat
reflecting
upon
the
old
proverb
a
greek
and
a
liar
the
mogrebin
soldiers
were
not
however
convinced
of
the
falsehood
of
the
report
and
pursued
their
way
to
the
mountain
they
found
no
robbers
there
but
repaid
themselves
for
the
trouble
they
had
taken
by
taking
possession
of
a
young
and
pretty
girl
which
they
carried
to
their
boat
as
a
lawful
prize
after
proceeding
a
few
miles
by
the
aid
of
the
cordel
we
put
to
land
at
sunset
near
a
village
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
we
found
here
the
ruins
of
a
christian
church
built
in
the
style
of
the
lower
greek
empire
of
which
one
column
of
red
granite
of
no
great
height
was
standing
it
bore
on
its
chapiter
a
cross
and
a
star
and
was
all
that
stood
on
its
base
others
fallen
and
broken
were
lying
near
it
the
soldiers
found
in
the
villages
near
us
several
hundred
women
and
about
two
hundred
men
they
were
peasants
who
had
taken
refuge
here
during
the
battle
between
the
brigands
and
the
troops
of
the
pasha
the
soldiers
were
disposed
to
treat
them
as
enemies
but
they
were
saved
from
their
fury
by
showing
a
paper
given
them
by
the
pasha
assuring
them
of
protection
it
is
the
rule
to
give
these
papers
to
every
village
not
hostile
to
protect
them
from
the
soldiers
we
remained
here
all
night
the
country
of
shageia
possessed
by
the
brigands
was
the
best
cultivated
we
had
seen
this
side
of
assuan
the
so
far
as
we
have
passed
their
country
being
frequently
within
half
a
throw
of
each
other
they
obliged
the
peasants
to
work
hard
to
raise
food
and
forage
to
ml
the
magazines
of
their
castles
which
are
seen
here
and
there
all
over
this
country
of
rebi
the
wind
and
the
direction
of
the
river
continuing
the
same
we
were
obliged
to
advance
by
the
cordel
the
country
continued
fine
and
well
cultivated
and
we
passed
several
large
and
beautiful
islands
in
walking
along
the
shore
saw
at
a
distance
a
large
castle
lately
occupied
by
the
brigands
on
visiting
it
found
it
capable
of
accommodating
at
least
a
thousand
men
the
walls
and
towers
very
thick
and
pierced
with
loopholes
it
had
been
taken
by
the
aid
of
the
artillery
and
almost
every
thing
combustible
in
it
had
been
burned
by
the
troops
a
few
miles
beyond
this
the
boat
stopped
for
the
night
of
rebi
heard
this
morning
at
with
great
pleasure
the
report
of
three
cannon
which
indicated
the
proximity
of
the
camp
we
proceeded
slowly
by
the
cordel
the
river
obstinate
in
maintaining
the
same
untoward
direction
and
the
wind
consequently
adverse
the
country
we
saw
like
that
we
have
passed
for
the
last
two
days
gave
us
continual
occasion
of
surprise
it
was
better
cultivated
than
any
part
of
the
countries
south
of
egypt
that
we
had
seen
it
was
crowded
with
villages
and
covered
with
grain
deserted
by
its
proprietors
in
the
afternoon
however
the
disagreeable
impression
produced
by
seeing
so
fine
a
country
without
inhabitants
was
almost
obliterated
by
the
pleasure
i
felt
on
being
informed
that
a
large
number
of
its
cultivators
with
their
wives
and
children
were
on
their
return
to
their
fields
and
houses
provided
with
an
escort
from
the
camp
and
a
firman
from
the
pasha
ismael
securing
them
from
outrage
and
assuring
them
of
protection
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
say
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
unfortunate
district
had
great
occasion
for
this
protection
the
soldiers
in
the
boats
were
disposed
to
take
liberties
with
the
inhabitants
on
the
plea
of
their
being
the
allies
of
the
brigands
this
morning
two
men
belonging
to
a
village
in
this
neighborhood
were
severely
beaten
and
their
wives
or
sisters
violated
by
some
soldiers
belonging
to
the
boats
this
afternoon
a
soldier
belonging
to
our
boat
accompanied
by
one
of
the
greeks
already
mentioned
and
the
frank
cook
of
the
proto
medico
went
to
the
same
village
without
my
knowledge
to
participate
in
this
licentious
amusement
they
were
somewhat
surprised
and
terribly
frightened
on
their
arrival
at
this
village
on
finding
themselves
suddenly
surrounded
by
about
two
hundred
peasants
armed
with
clubs
who
fiercely
demanded
what
they
wanted
asking
them
if
they
had
come
as
others
had
before
them
to
cudgel
the
men
and
violate
the
women
and
ordered
them
to
be
off
immediately
to
the
boats
the
luckless
fornicators
confounded
by
this
unexpected
reception
were
heartily
glad
to
be
allowed
to
sneak
back
to
the
boat
in
confusion
and
terror
on
their
arrival
and
this
affair
becoming
known
to
me
i
abused
them
with
all
the
eloquence
i
could
muster
first
for
their
villainy
and
then
for
their
cowardice
as
they
were
well
armed
and
had
fled
before
the
face
of
cudgels
when
we
stopped
at
night
we
were
told
that
we
were
about
three
hours
distance
from
the
camp
of
rebi
the
river
and
the
wind
still
obliged
us
to
proceed
slowly
by
the
cordel
the
country
we
passed
was
fine
and
had
been
cultivated
with
great
care
but
deserted
the
face
of
the
fields
was
almost
covered
with
the
household
furniture
of
the
villagers
straw
mats
equal
to
any
sold
at
cairo
were
abandoned
by
hundreds
on
the
spots
where
they
had
been
employed
for
the
night
by
the
troops
when
on
the
pursuit
after
the
brigands
who
had
fled
from
the
last
battle
many
of
the
largest
of
these
mats
the
soldiers
had
formed
into
square
huts
for
the
different
guards
the
abandoned
harvests
waved
solitary
in
the
wind
and
the
numerous
were
all
motionless
we
passed
several
large
castles
not
many
days
back
garrisoned
by
fierce
marauders
who
claimed
all
around
them
or
within
the
reach
of
their
horses
feet
as
theirs
and
many
well
built
villages
whose
inhabitants
were
the
slaves
of
their
will
in
one
of
these
deserted
castles
we
found
fragments
of
vessels
of
porcelain
basins
of
marble
chests
of
polished
indian
wood
the
pillage
probably
of
some
caravan
and
a
small
brass
cannon
the
walls
of
the
apartments
were
hung
with
large
and
colored
straw
mats
of
fine
workmanship
and
showed
many
indications
of
the
pains
taken
to
make
them
comfortable
and
convenient
an
hour
after
noon
we
met
great
numbers
of
men
women
and
children
accompanied
by
their
herds
and
flocks
who
were
returning
to
this
abandoned
country
by
the
encouragement
and
under
the
protection
of
the
pasha
it
was
an
affecting
sight
to
see
almost
every
one
of
these
unfortunate
women
carrying
her
naked
and
forlorn
children
either
upon
her
shoulders
or
in
her
arms
or
leading
them
by
the
hand
the
pleasure
i
felt
at
seeing
these
proofs
of
the
humanity
of
the
pasha
ismael
was
diminished
by
seeing
his
disregarded
by
some
of
the
mogrebin
soldiers
and
particularly
by
the
greek
and
frank
domestics
of
the
proto
medico
bosari
who
seized
from
the
hands
of
these
miserable
creatures
as
many
sheep
and
goats
as
they
thought
they
had
occasion
for
about
an
hour
before
sunset
we
passed
the
encampment
of
abdin
cacheff
on
the
right
or
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
at
came
in
view
of
that
of
the
pasha
about
three
miles
farther
up
on
the
same
side
we
stopped
to
pass
the
night
as
the
boatmen
were
too
much
fatigued
to
draw
the
boat
any
farther
of
rebi
the
direction
of
the
river
and
the
wind
still
the
same
proceeded
slowly
by
the
cordel
till
about
two
hours
after
noon
when
we
arrived
at
the
camp
of
the
hasnardar
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
that
of
the
pasha
was
on
the
opposite
side
not
far
from
the
camp
of
the
hasnardar
some
ruins
and
several
small
pyramids
attracted
my
attention
as
i
could
not
go
to
the
pasha
before
i
determined
to
employ
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
a
visit
to
these
antiquities
which
lay
near
a
large
high
and
isolated
rock
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
river
i
found
before
this
rock
the
ruins
of
a
very
large
temple
which
covered
a
great
space
of
ground
some
columns
almost
consumed
by
time
were
standing
nearly
buried
in
the
rubbish
the
bases
of
others
were
visible
which
from
their
position
evidently
once
supported
an
avenue
of
pillars
leading
to
an
excavation
in
the
great
rock
aforementioned
against
and
joining
on
to
the
side
of
which
that
fronted
towards
the
river
this
temple
appeared
to
have
been
constructed
among
the
ruins
saw
two
large
lions
of
red
granite
one
broken
and
the
other
little
injured
and
a
small
headless
statue
about
two
feet
high
in
a
sitting
posture
on
approaching
the
front
of
the
rock
found
it
excavated
into
a
small
temple
whose
interior
was
sculptured
with
the
usual
figures
and
symbols
seen
in
the
temples
of
ancient
egypt
its
roof
and
that
of
the
porch
before
it
exhibited
several
traces
of
the
azure
with
which
it
had
been
painted
the
porch
before
this
excavation
was
supported
by
caryatid
figures
representing
huge
lions
standing
nearly
erect
upon
their
hinder
legs
the
ruins
before
the
rock
seemed
to
me
to
have
originally
composed
a
large
temple
of
which
this
excavation
was
the
inner
sanctuary
the
pyramids
were
close
by
these
ruins
i
counted
seventeen
some
of
them
in
ruins
and
others
perfect
those
which
were
uninjured
were
small
of
a
height
greater
than
the
breadth
of
the
base
which
was
generally
about
twenty
feet
square
the
sides
resembled
steep
stairs
they
were
however
compactly
and
very
handsomely
constructed
of
hewn
stones
similar
to
the
rock
before
mentioned
and
probably
taken
from
it
before
some
of
these
pyramids
and
attached
to
one
of
their
sides
we
found
low
buildings
resembling
small
temples
and
judging
from
the
interior
of
one
we
found
open
intended
as
such
as
the
inside
of
this
one
was
covered
with
the
usual
hieroglyphics
and
figures
it
would
be
a
work
of
little
difficulty
to
open
the
pyramid
to
which
was
attached
the
little
temple
i
entered
as
the
figure
of
a
door
of
stone
in
the
pyramid
is
to
be
seen
when
inside
of
the
temple
attached
to
its
side
in
view
from
this
place
many
other
pyramids
were
in
view
higher
up
the
river
on
the
opposite
bank
one
of
them
large
the
people
of
the
country
called
the
place
i
visited
meroe
as
likewise
the
whole
territory
where
these
ruins
are
found
the
ruins
i
have
mentioned
do
not
appear
ever
to
have
been
disturbed
i
doubt
not
that
several
remains
worth
research
lie
concealed
under
the
rubbish
which
here
covers
a
great
space
of
ground
no
other
remains
of
antiquity
are
visible
in
this
place
besides
those
i
have
mentioned
the
immediate
spot
where
they
stand
and
its
vicinity
backward
from
the
river
is
covered
by
the
sand
of
the
desert
underneath
which
probably
many
more
lie
concealed
the
river
nile
has
been
represented
and
i
think
with
justice
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
i
do
not
consider
it
as
meriting
this
appellation
so
much
on
account
of
its
periodical
and
regular
floods
in
which
respect
it
is
resembled
by
several
other
rivers
as
on
account
of
another
circumstance
in
which
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
without
a
parallel
the
nile
resembles
the
path
of
a
good
man
in
a
wicked
and
worthless
world
it
runs
through
a
desert
a
dry
barren
hideous
desert
on
the
parts
of
which
adjoining
its
course
it
has
deposited
the
richest
soil
in
the
world
which
it
continually
waters
and
nourishes
this
soil
has
been
the
source
of
subsistence
to
several
powerful
nations
who
have
established
and
overthrown
mighty
kingdoms
and
have
originated
the
arts
the
religion
the
learning
and
the
civilization
of
the
greater
part
of
the
ancient
world
these
nations
instructors
and
pupils
have
perished
but
the
remains
of
their
stupendous
labors
the
pyramids
and
the
temples
of
egypt
nubia
and
in
the
countries
now
visited
for
the
first
time
at
least
for
many
ages
by
minds
capable
of
appreciating
the
peoples
who
erected
them
are
more
than
sufficient
to
excite
astonishment
and
respect
for
the
nations
who
founded
them
the
few
in
stances
that
i
have
mentioned
are
such
as
have
presented
themselves
to
my
notice
in
sailing
up
the
river
without
my
having
the
opportunity
to
scrutinize
them
particularly
or
time
or
means
to
pursue
any
researches
in
the
vicinity
of
those
i
have
seen
by
which
doubtless
many
more
would
be
discovered
some
future
traveler
in
these
interesting
and
remote
regions
who
may
have
the
power
and
the
means
to
traverse
at
his
leisure
the
banks
and
islands
i
have
seen
and
admired
will
i
believe
find
his
labors
rewarded
by
discoveries
which
will
interest
the
learned
and
gratify
the
curious
a
voyage
up
the
nile
may
be
considered
as
presenting
an
epitome
of
the
moral
history
of
man
we
meet
at
almost
every
stage
with
the
monuments
of
his
superstition
his
tyranny
or
his
luxury
but
with
few
memorials
of
his
ingenuity
directed
with
a
view
to
real
utility
we
also
every
where
behold
the
traces
of
the
vengeance
of
almighty
justice
upon
his
crimes
everywhere
on
the
banks
of
the
ancient
river
we
behold
cities
once
famous
for
power
and
luxury
a
desolation
and
dry
like
a
wilderness
and
temples
once
famous
and
colossal
idols
once
feared
now
prostrate
and
confounded
with
the
dust
of
their
worshippers
the
flocks
lie
down
in
the
midst
thereof
the
cormorant
and
bittern
lodge
in
the
temples
and
palaces
their
voice
sings
in
the
windows
and
desolation
is
in
the
thresholds
the
peoples
who
now
occupy
the
territories
of
nations
extinct
or
exterminated
have
profited
neither
by
their
history
nor
their
fate
what
was
once
a
land
occupied
by
nations
superstitious
and
sensual
is
now
inhabited
by
robbers
and
slaves
the
robbers
have
been
expelled
or
slain
and
the
oppressed
peasant
is
emancipated
by
the
arms
of
the
nation
who
avenged
the
cause
of
heaven
upon
the
degenerate
greeks
but
who
nevertheless
have
derived
neither
instruction
nor
warning
from
their
downfall
and
subjugation
the
nile
meantime
which
has
seen
so
many
nations
and
generations
rise
and
disappear
still
flows
and
overflows
to
distribute
its
fertilizing
waters
to
the
countries
on
its
borders
like
the
good
providence
which
seems
unwearied
in
trying
to
overcome
the
ingratitude
of
man
by
the
favors
of
heaven
on
my
arrival
at
the
camp
i
was
informed
of
the
particulars
of
the
progress
of
the
victorious
son
of
the
distinguished
meheromet
ali
from
wady
haifa
to
meroe
before
his
march
every
thing
had
submitted
or
fallen
all
attempts
to
arrest
his
progress
had
proved
as
unavailing
as
the
obstacles
opposed
by
the
savage
rocks
of
the
cataracts
of
the
nile
to
the
powerful
course
of
that
beneficent
and
fertilizing
river
his
excellence
as
said
before
set
out
from
wady
haifa
on
the
of
zilhadge
last
in
ten
days
of
forced
march
he
arrived
at
new
dongola
a
little
beyond
this
village
the
selictar
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
of
about
four
hundred
men
surprised
and
dispersed
about
fifteen
hundred
of
the
enemy
taking
many
of
their
horses
and
camels
four
days
march
beyond
new
dongola
the
pasha
at
the
head
of
the
advance
guard
of
the
army
came
up
with
the
main
body
of
the
shageias
and
their
allies
strongly
posted
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
near
a
village
called
courty
on
the
westerly
bank
of
the
river
the
pasha
at
this
juncture
had
with
him
but
six
hundred
cavalry
and
some
of
the
abbadies
mounted
on
dromedaries
of
whom
we
had
about
five
hundred
with
the
army
but
none
of
his
cannon
the
enemy
advanced
to
the
combat
with
loud
screams
and
cries
and
with
great
fury
the
abbadies
could
not
withstand
their
charge
and
were
driven
rearward
at
this
critical
instant
his
excellence
gave
the
order
and
the
cavalry
of
the
pasha
charged
and
poured
in
the
fire
of
their
carabines
and
pistols
after
a
conflict
of
no
long
duration
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
fled
in
dismay
while
those
who
fought
on
foot
fell
on
their
faces
throwing
their
shields
over
their
heads
to
secure
them
from
the
tramp
of
the
cavalry
and
implored
mercy
in
consequence
of
the
result
of
this
affair
all
the
country
between
the
place
of
combat
and
shageia
the
country
occupied
by
the
castles
and
immediate
subjects
of
the
maleks
of
shageia
submitted
and
were
pardoned
the
pasha
pursued
his
march
to
the
province
of
shageia
where
malek
shouus
the
principal
among
the
shageia
chiefs
had
collected
the
whole
force
of
the
republic
of
the
brigands
with
a
determination
to
risk
another
battle
the
pasha
found
on
his
arrival
a
part
of
their
force
posted
on
an
island
near
the
long
mountain
i
have
mentioned
in
my
journal
as
having
been
the
scene
of
a
combat
a
few
day
before
i
reached
it
those
of
the
enemy
who
were
in
the
island
were
forthwith
attacked
by
troops
sent
over
in
the
boats
which
accompanied
the
army
and
were
cut
to
pieces
or
driven
into
the
river
the
army
then
advanced
to
attack
the
great
mass
of
the
enemy
in
their
position
on
the
mountain
it
was
a
very
advantageous
one
the
mountain
runs
nearly
at
right
angles
with
the
river
which
it
nearly
reaches
leaving
between
itself
and
the
river
a
tract
of
ground
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
width
which
at
the
time
was
covered
with
plantations
of
durra
the
enemy
were
posted
on
the
side
of
this
mountain
and
among
the
durra
in
the
open
ground
between
the
mountain
and
the
river
so
that
their
rear
was
secured
by
the
mountain
and
their
right
covered
by
a
strong
castle
at
the
foot
of
its
extremity
lying
off
from
the
river
malek
shouus
malek
zibarra
and
the
other
chiefs
of
shageia
and
their
immediate
followers
composed
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
they
had
assembled
either
by
force
or
persuasion
all
the
peasantry
subject
to
their
dominion
the
whole
forming
a
mass
which
blackened
the
whole
side
of
the
mountain
their
arms
consisted
of
lances
shields
and
long
broad
swords
these
wretched
peasants
who
were
all
on
foot
their
masters
posted
in
front
in
order
to
receive
and
exhaust
the
fire
of
the
pasha
troops
while
shouus
and
the
cavalry
occupied
the
rear
in
order
to
keep
the
peasants
to
their
posts
and
to
have
the
start
of
the
pasha
cavalry
in
case
they
should
find
it
necessary
to
take
to
flight
the
pasha
posted
his
troops
parallel
to
the
enemy
placing
the
greater
part
of
the
cavalry
opposite
the
open
ground
between
the
mountain
and
the
river
and
pushing
the
artillery
a
little
in
advance
the
enemy
with
loud
cries
and
uplifted
lances
rushed
forward
some
of
the
peasants
in
advance
of
the
others
with
no
other
arms
than
lances
and
shields
threw
themselves
upon
the
cannon
and
were
blown
to
pieces
the
castle
on
the
right
of
the
enemy
was
stormed
after
feeling
the
effects
of
a
few
rounds
from
the
artillery
which
dashed
horse
and
man
to
pieces
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
fled
in
dismay
leaving
their
infantry
to
be
rode
over
and
shot
down
by
our
cavalry
who
destroyed
many
hundreds
of
them
in
the
battle
and
during
the
pursuit
malek
shouus
and
his
cavalry
did
not
discontinue
their
flight
till
they
reached
the
territory
of
shendi
leaving
their
numerous
and
strong
castles
their
dependant
villages
and
a
rich
and
beautiful
country
in
the
hands
of
the
conqueror
on
the
of
rebi
i
passed
over
to
the
camp
of
the
pasha
i
did
not
however
obtain
an
audience
of
his
excellence
till
two
days
after
when
being
alone
he
sent
for
me
and
received
me
in
the
most
nattering
manner
ordering
me
as
usual
to
sit
in
his
presence
after
the
usual
compliments
i
informed
his
excellence
that
i
had
been
much
mortified
and
distressed
that
the
act
of
god
in
depriving
me
of
the
use
of
my
eyes
a
few
days
before
his
excellence
left
wady
halfa
had
prevented
me
from
accompanying
his
victorious
march
and
participating
in
the
exploits
of
his
troops
so
that
i
had
not
arrived
till
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
his
excellence
replied
that
a
great
deal
more
remained
to
be
done
in
which
i
should
have
a
share
i
replied
with
a
compliment
and
then
demanded
horses
and
camels
for
myself
and
the
soldiers
i
had
brought
with
me
he
replied
that
i
should
have
them
after
some
further
conversation
of
a
confidential
nature
i
retired
during
the
nine
days
following
i
had
reason
to
applaud
the
humanity
and
good
policy
of
the
pasha
in
offering
amnesty
and
peace
to
all
the
brigands
who
should
come
in
and
surrender
themselves
several
of
their
chiefs
whom
they
call
maleks
accompanied
by
their
followers
came
in
while
the
camp
remained
near
meroe
the
chiefs
were
presented
with
costly
habiliments
and
the
written
protection
of
his
excellence
recognizing
them
as
under
his
safeguard
and
returned
with
their
followers
to
their
homes
tranquillized
and
contented
the
most
rigid
discipline
was
observed
in
the
camp
to
prevent
the
people
of
the
country
from
suffering
by
the
presence
of
the
army
some
soldiers
and
domestics
were
severely
beaten
for
taking
sheep
and
goats
without
paying
for
them
and
five
of
the
abbadies
or
auxiliaries
mounted
on
dromedaries
were
impaled
for
having
seized
some
camels
from
the
peasants
it
was
truly
honorable
to
the
army
and
its
commander
to
see
villages
embosomed
in
a
camp
whose
inhabitants
men
women
and
children
pursued
their
usual
occupations
without
molestation
and
without
fear
in
the
country
below
which
had
been
the
scene
of
combat
the
fields
were
deserted
and
for
several
days
i
had
not
seen
a
peasant
at
work
upon
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
of
the
pasha
where
the
people
had
submitted
themselves
the
discordant
creak
of
the
frequently
attracted
the
ear
and
the
peasants
cultivated
their
fields
within
musket
shot
of
the
camp
of
a
conqueror
on
the
of
rebi
a
detachment
consisting
of
three
hundred
cavalry
departed
from
the
camp
for
the
country
of
the
berbers
to
secure
its
submission
and
to
obtain
horses
and
camels
for
the
army
learning
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
pasha
to
march
in
a
few
days
to
pitch
his
camp
about
eight
hours
march
farther
up
the
river
i
wished
to
ascertain
whether
i
could
have
the
horses
and
camels
i
needed
before
the
pasha
marched
his
reply
to
my
demand
was
that
he
had
no
camels
at
present
that
were
not
appropriated
to
some
service
or
other
but
that
as
soon
as
he
had
them
i
should
receive
what
i
needed
i
was
consequently
obliged
to
embark
in
a
boat
to
accompany
the
march
of
the
camp
as
without
camels
to
carry
my
tent
and
baggage
i
could
not
accompany
it
by
land
on
the
all
the
boats
followed
the
departure
of
the
troops
the
wind
was
ahead
and
the
direction
of
the
river
the
same
as
repeatedly
before
mentioned
we
proceeded
slowly
by
the
cordel
this
circumstance
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
visiting
the
pyramids
which
i
have
mentioned
as
in
view
from
meroe
they
stand
about
half
a
mile
from
the
right
hand
bank
of
the
river
i
counted
none
of
them
perfect
and
most
of
them
in
ruins
the
greater
part
of
them
are
built
of
stone
and
are
evidently
much
more
ancient
than
those
of
meroe
the
largest
is
probably
more
than
a
hundred
feet
square
and
something
more
in
height
it
presents
a
singularity
in
its
construction
worthy
of
notice
it
is
a
pyramid
within
a
pyramid
the
inner
pyramid
has
been
cased
over
by
a
larger
one
one
of
its
sides
being
in
ruins
makes
this
peculiarity
visible
by
climbing
up
the
ruined
side
it
is
easy
to
reach
its
summit
no
remains
of
a
city
or
any
traces
of
temples
are
visible
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
place
which
is
called
by
the
natives
turboot
on
the
we
came
in
view
of
the
lower
end
of
the
rapids
of
the
third
cataract
those
hereabouts
are
called
the
rapids
of
oula
we
were
obliged
to
consume
days
in
getting
as
far
as
the
island
of
kendi
which
is
not
above
fifty
miles
from
meroe
as
the
direction
of
the
river
continued
almost
the
same
coming
from
about
the
and
the
wind
being
almost
invariably
ahead
the
difficulties
attending
advancing
the
boats
by
the
cordel
were
very
great
as
the
river
here
is
spotted
by
an
infinity
of
islands
and
rocks
in
some
of
the
passages
where
the
water
was
deep
the
current
was
as
swift
as
a
which
made
it
necessary
to
employ
the
crews
of
perhaps
twenty
boats
to
drag
up
one
at
a
time
in
other
passages
where
the
water
was
very
shallow
it
was
sometimes
necessary
to
drag
the
boats
by
main
force
over
the
stones
at
the
bottom
the
camp
of
the
pasha
remained
during
all
this
time
about
eight
hours
march
above
meroe
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
waiting
till
the
boats
should
have
passed
the
rapids
no
military
movements
took
place
except
detaching
the
divan
effendi
with
four
hundred
cavalry
to
join
the
detachment
already
in
berber
where
all
was
quiet
and
friendly
the
country
on
the
rapids
of
the
third
cataract
is
sterile
being
composed
for
the
most
part
of
black
granite
and
sand
excepting
some
of
the
islands
which
contained
good
ground
and
a
few
spots
on
the
shores
where
the
floods
of
the
river
had
deposited
some
fertile
soil
the
rocks
by
the
shore
presented
indications
which
proved
that
the
river
had
risen
in
some
of
its
floods
about
twenty
feet
above
its
present
level
ostriches
are
not
unfrequently
seen
hereabouts
we
have
met
with
no
ruins
of
any
ancient
building
of
consequence
on
these
rapids
except
the
ruins
of
a
strong
fort
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
those
of
what
was
probably
a
christian
monastery
on
the
bank
right
opposite
this
place
i
was
told
is
called
kennis
it
is
about
thirty
miles
above
meroe
we
passed
one
small
island
which
the
natives
said
was
called
also
meroe
as
well
as
the
site
where
we
found
the
pyramids
and
temple
below
no
indications
of
a
considerable
city
are
however
to
be
found
on
this
island
which
is
beside
too
small
to
have
served
for
the
emplacement
of
a
city
of
consequence
khalil
aga
who
swam
over
to
this
island
reported
that
he
had
seen
there
the
ruins
of
brick
houses
and
many
fragments
of
porcelain
of
the
latter
there
are
immense
quantities
among
all
the
ruined
edifices
found
in
this
country
the
island
of
kendi
is
large
and
in
some
parts
cultivated
it
contains
evident
traces
of
brick
buildings
among
which
we
found
fragments
of
ancient
pottery
and
porcelain
but
no
ruins
of
any
considerable
building
we
stayed
for
three
days
as
high
up
as
the
middle
of
the
island
of
kendi
on
the
of
jamisalawal
the
boats
received
orders
to
descend
to
the
lower
end
of
the
island
in
order
to
take
the
passage
on
its
right
hand
side
that
on
the
left
being
so
shallow
as
not
to
be
passed
but
with
great
difficulty
we
descended
accordingly
and
remained
at
its
lower
extremity
till
the
thirteenth
of
the
moon
which
delay
was
occasioned
by
the
absence
of
the
rais
bashi
who
had
gone
up
to
examine
and
sound
the
passages
through
the
remainder
of
the
third
cataract
on
the
thirteenth
our
boat
and
many
others
passed
over
to
the
right
bank
of
the
river
in
order
to
be
on
the
same
side
as
was
the
camp
of
the
pasha
and
to
have
free
communication
with
it
the
same
day
i
received
an
order
from
the
pasha
to
come
to
the
camp
with
my
baggage
i
went
accordingly
and
presented
myself
to
his
excellency
and
demanded
to
know
his
pleasure
he
replied
that
it
was
his
will
that
i
should
stay
in
the
camp
and
that
he
would
immediately
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
accompanying
him
in
his
intended
march
to
berber
over
the
desert
five
days
after
his
excellency
broke
up
his
camp
and
proceeded
about
four
leagues
higher
up
the
rapids
where
the
boats
were
found
stopped
by
the
impossibility
of
proceeding
any
farther
as
the
water
was
found
to
be
too
low
to
admit
their
passing
i
arrived
at
this
place
opposite
the
upper
end
of
the
island
of
kendi
on
the
same
day
with
his
excellency
having
left
orders
to
my
domestics
to
follow
with
my
camels
and
baggage
the
next
morning
finding
that
they
had
not
arrived
and
learning
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
pasha
to
commence
his
march
to
berber
that
day
i
mounted
my
horse
to
go
and
ascertain
the
reason
why
my
camels
had
not
arrived
i
learned
as
i
proceeded
that
one
of
them
had
fallen
under
his
load
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
send
back
the
first
that
should
arrive
and
be
unloaded
to
take
the
burden
of
the
other
all
my
effects
inconsequence
did
not
arrive
before
evening
during
my
absence
to
see
after
this
vexatious
affair
the
pasha
had
departed
with
the
camp
as
i
learned
the
same
evening
on
my
return
after
leaving
the
most
bulky
part
of
my
baggage
in
one
of
the
boats
i
proceeded
on
the
to
the
place
where
the
pasha
last
camp
had
been
to
join
some
party
who
should
have
been
delayed
by
circumstances
similar
to
my
misadventure
on
my
arrival
i
found
the
hasna
katib
and
about
three
hundred
soldiers
waiting
till
camels
should
come
from
berber
to
carry
them
to
join
the
pasha
there
were
besides
seven
hundred
mogrebin
infantry
in
the
boats
awaiting
the
means
of
transporting
their
tents
and
baggage
across
the
desert
on
my
representing
to
the
hasna
katib
the
circumstance
that
had
delayed
me
he
informed
me
that
the
selictar
was
expected
from
below
in
a
few
days
who
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
would
proceed
after
the
pasha
and
that
i
had
better
accompany
him
i
accepted
the
advice
and
pitched
my
tent
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
selictar
the
same
day
i
was
informed
that
all
the
large
boats
had
received
orders
to
abandon
the
attempt
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
third
cataract
of
the
nile
they
had
already
with
great
difficulty
got
through
about
fifty
difficult
passages
and
it
was
reported
that
there
were
nearly
one
hundred
more
ahead
before
the
third
cataract
could
be
got
clear
of
when
the
river
is
full
and
the
flood
of
course
strong
this
cataract
must
in
my
opinion
be
almost
impassable
upwards
as
on
account
of
the
strange
direction
of
the
river
little
or
no
aid
can
be
derived
from
the
wind
and
the
current
in
some
places
from
the
straitness
of
the
passages
between
the
rocks
and
islands
must
in
the
time
of
the
inundation
be
very
furious
while
the
cordel
from
the
natural
obstacles
which
cover
the
shore
of
this
cataract
could
hardly
overcome
the
difficulties
which
every
mile
or
two
would
present
on
the
first
day
of
the
moon
jamisalachar
the
selictar
arrived
from
below
where
he
had
been
to
collect
durra
for
the
army
two
days
after
i
set
forward
in
company
with
him
to
pass
the
desert
the
road
for
two
days
lay
near
the
bank
of
the
river
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
we
arrived
at
a
pleasant
spot
on
the
border
of
the
nile
where
we
encamped
to
pass
the
night
on
the
morning
following
we
mounted
our
horses
at
sunrise
and
by
arrived
at
a
fine
pond
of
water
at
the
foot
of
a
high
rock
at
no
great
distance
from
the
river
where
we
refreshed
ourselves
and
filled
the
as
at
this
place
the
roads
turns
into
the
desert
we
marched
from
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
till
an
hour
after
midnight
when
we
halted
to
sleep
the
road
for
this
day
was
evidently
the
dry
bed
of
an
arm
of
the
nile
which
during
the
inundation
is
full
of
water
even
at
this
season
the
doum
tree
and
the
acacia
which
grew
on
its
borders
were
green
and
coarse
long
grass
was
abundant
at
sunrise
of
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
we
again
mounted
and
set
forward
in
a
direction
nearly
east
our
way
lay
over
low
rocky
hills
gravelly
or
sandy
plains
and
sometimes
through
valleys
containing
plenty
of
coarse
grass
and
acacia
trees
but
no
water
is
to
be
found
above
ground
at
this
season
though
it
probably
might
be
obtained
by
sinking
wells
in
some
of
these
valleys
we
halted
at
noon
and
in
two
hours
after
again
mounted
and
marched
till
midnight
our
road
lay
through
a
country
resembling
that
we
had
passed
the
day
before
on
the
morrow
morning
a
little
after
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
and
at
noon
halted
at
the
only
well
of
water
we
found
on
our
route
it
lies
near
two
high
hills
of
black
granite
the
water
was
yellow
and
dirty
and
was
almost
rejected
by
the
thirsty
camels
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
were
again
on
horseback
and
marched
till
midnight
when
some
of
the
camels
dropping
and
dying
and
others
giving
out
the
selictar
found
himself
obliged
to
order
a
halt
for
the
rest
of
the
night
it
was
his
intention
to
have
marched
till
morning
by
which
time
our
guides
told
us
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
river
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
ground
to
sleep
a
few
hours
but
by
sunrise
we
were
called
to
mount
and
away
we
proceeded
till
about
noon
when
we
came
in
view
of
the
beneficent
river
whose
beauty
and
value
can
not
be
duly
appreciated
by
any
who
have
not
voyaged
in
the
deserts
through
which
it
holds
its
course
it
was
on
the
eighth
of
the
moon
when
we
arrived
on
its
borders
i
had
expected
that
our
toilsome
forced
march
would
end
here
and
had
promised
myself
some
repose
which
i
greatly
needed
as
i
had
suffered
much
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
which
had
burned
the
skin
off
my
face
from
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
from
hunger
as
we
had
barely
time
to
prepare
a
little
rice
and
bread
once
in
hours
and
from
the
exasperation
of
my
ophthalmia
which
had
never
entirely
quitted
me
since
i
was
attacked
by
it
at
wady
halfa
on
the
second
cataract
the
selictar
however
did
not
indulge
us
with
more
than
half
a
day
and
one
night
repose
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
we
found
well
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
numerous
villages
in
sight
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
day
of
the
moon
we
were
again
called
to
proceed
for
this
day
our
march
lay
near
the
bank
of
the
river
and
through
and
by
fine
fields
of
barley
cotton
and
wheat
the
day
after
our
route
lay
over
a
narrow
space
of
rocky
land
lying
between
the
river
and
the
hills
of
the
desert
we
saw
this
day
but
a
few
cultivated
spots
on
the
we
commenced
our
march
before
sunrise
animated
by
the
information
that
we
should
be
at
the
pasha
camp
by
noon
or
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
our
road
lay
this
day
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
just
where
it
touches
the
cultivable
soil
deposited
by
the
nile
which
is
indicative
of
the
point
to
which
the
inundations
of
the
river
extend
in
this
country
on
both
sides
of
tills
road
was
an
almost
continued
succession
of
villages
which
are
built
here
in
order
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
overflowing
of
the
river
which
almost
every
year
here
overspreads
the
country
for
one
or
two
miles
from
its
banks
the
land
liable
to
this
inundation
is
in
part
cultivated
as
well
as
any
portion
of
egypt
and
in
part
devoted
to
feeding
great
numbers
of
fine
horses
camels
dromedaries
kine
sheep
and
goats
with
which
the
country
of
the
berbers
is
abundantly
stocked
we
marched
on
till
nearly
set
of
sun
without
halting
when
we
arrived
at
the
encampment
of
the
pasha
it
was
on
our
side
the
west
side
of
the
nile
which
here
runs
in
its
natural
direction
from
south
to
north
at
five
or
six
days
march
below
it
it
turns
to
the
left
and
describes
from
above
its
turning
point
and
dongola
a
track
something
resembling
the
following
figure
which
is
the
reason
why
in
coming
up
the
river
from
dongola
we
found
it
running
from
the
the
length
of
this
curious
bend
in
the
river
nile
never
known
to
the
civilized
world
before
the
expedition
of
ismael
pasha
may
be
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
long
the
greater
part
of
it
all
rocks
and
rapids
the
journey
from
our
last
encampment
on
the
third
cataract
to
the
country
of
the
berbers
following
the
direction
of
the
river
takes
eight
days
of
forced
marches
but
that
by
the
desert
across
the
peninsula
formed
by
the
course
of
the
river
between
the
country
of
the
berbers
and
our
last
encampment
takes
four
days
forced
march
the
road
from
the
place
where
we
arrived
at
the
river
in
coming
from
the
desert
up
the
country
of
berber
lies
generally
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
and
outside
of
the
fertile
land
lying
between
the
river
and
the
desert
of
consequence
we
were
rarely
led
to
its
banks
so
as
to
ascertain
its
course
and
appearance
but
from
several
points
where
the
road
approaches
the
river
i
observed
that
it
winded
continually
and
contained
many
beautiful
islands
some
of
them
particularly
that
named
sibne
cultivated
like
gardens
i
also
observed
that
the
river
at
the
lower
extremity
of
the
country
of
the
berbers
is
much
interrupted
by
rocks
and
i
have
learned
since
my
arrival
that
between
the
third
cataract
and
the
camp
the
water
is
so
low
at
this
season
that
the
canja
of
the
pasha
probably
the
first
boat
that
ever
passed
the
third
cataract
of
the
nile
was
obliged
to
be
lifted
three
times
over
shallow
passages
the
natives
of
this
country
had
never
seen
a
sail
boat
before
the
arrival
of
this
canja
they
called
it
a
water
mare
comparing
it
by
this
appellation
to
the
swiftest
animal
with
which
they
are
acquainted
they
ran
in
crowds
to
the
river
edge
to
see
it
mount
the
current
without
the
aid
of
oars
on
the
i
had
a
private
audience
of
the
pasha
in
the
evening
his
excellence
received
me
as
usual
and
on
my
informing
him
of
the
circumstance
which
had
prevented
my
accompanying
his
march
from
the
cataract
he
assured
me
that
he
would
give
orders
that
for
the
future
i
should
be
furnished
from
the
best
of
his
own
camels
i
preferred
to
his
excellence
some
requests
which
he
granted
immediately
and
on
my
retiring
requested
me
to
present
myself
to
him
frequently
previous
to
his
march
from
the
third
cataract
there
had
arrived
at
the
camp
ambassadors
from
shendi
from
malek
shouus
the
chief
of
the
fugitive
shageians
demanding
terms
of
peace
the
pasha
replied
that
the
only
terms
on
which
they
could
obtain
peace
with
him
would
be
by
the
surrender
of
their
horses
and
arms
and
returning
to
their
country
to
live
tranquilly
and
without
disturbing
their
neighbors
the
ambassadors
replied
that
they
would
not
give
up
their
horses
and
arms
the
pasha
then
answered
that
then
he
would
come
to
shendi
and
take
them
to
which
it
is
said
they
answered
come
on
hearing
however
of
the
rapid
march
of
the
pasha
and
of
his
arrival
in
berber
the
chief
of
shendi
on
whose
support
it
seems
shouus
had
calculated
was
frightened
and
sent
his
son
bearing
some
valuable
presents
to
the
pasha
to
notify
his
submission
and
to
receive
his
orders
the
terror
and
confusion
this
step
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
allies
of
sennaar
will
occasion
to
the
latter
will
probably
prevent
the
necessity
of
a
battle
to
ensure
its
submission
a
part
of
the
remnant
of
the
once
powerful
mamalukes
of
egypt
who
had
fled
before
the
pasha
to
shendi
on
his
arrival
in
berber
have
surrendered
themselves
to
the
protection
of
the
pasha
ismael
they
have
been
treated
by
him
with
great
kindness
and
were
presented
with
a
thousand
piasters
each
to
bear
their
expenses
to
cairo
to
which
place
they
have
departed
with
the
assurance
of
passing
the
remainder
of
their
lives
in
tranquility
in
egypt
under
the
protection
and
favor
of
mehemmed
ali
they
had
gone
from
the
camp
before
my
arrival
i
was
informed
that
these
mamalukes
were
in
possession
of
many
slaves
and
fine
horses
which
will
turn
to
good
account
in
egypt
a
small
remnant
of
the
mamalukes
at
shendi
under
the
direction
of
a
refractory
bey
have
fled
to
the
countries
on
the
bahar
el
abiud
where
they
will
probably
perish
miserably
the
divan
effendi
who
has
been
sent
to
shendi
to
arrange
the
terms
of
peace
with
the
malek
of
that
country
had
orders
to
assure
this
bey
and
his
followers
there
of
the
same
favor
and
protection
already
accorded
to
their
comrades
who
had
already
departed
for
egypt
but
without
success
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
however
that
the
remnant
of
the
once
powerful
mamalukes
who
have
surrendered
themselves
to
the
compassion
and
protection
of
the
viceroy
will
receive
both
from
him
whose
humanity
has
been
interested
in
their
behalf
since
their
power
is
gone
and
their
number
reduced
to
a
few
individuals
who
doubtless
will
be
happy
to
live
tranquilly
in
the
country
these
unfortunate
fugitives
continually
sigh
after
and
whose
sovereignty
they
have
lost
by
their
own
misconduct
i
passed
over
in
the
canja
of
the
pasha
to
the
east
side
of
the
river
to
visit
the
capital
of
berber
which
is
nearly
opposite
to
our
camp
on
reaching
the
bank
it
is
a
walk
of
half
an
hour
through
immense
fields
of
durra
to
come
to
the
road
that
leads
to
the
residence
of
the
chief
after
quitting
the
plantations
i
came
to
a
collection
of
villages
extending
about
three
miles
down
the
river
among
these
villages
is
one
called
goos
which
is
marked
in
the
maps
as
the
capital
of
berber
but
the
residence
of
the
malek
or
chief
of
the
eastern
shore
is
not
at
goos
but
at
another
of
the
collection
much
larger
called
nousreddin
as
i
was
informed
after
the
name
of
the
present
malek
who
resides
there
the
houses
of
these
villages
like
the
rest
in
the
country
of
berber
are
built
of
clay
and
roofed
with
unhewn
timber
covered
with
trusses
of
straw
that
of
the
malek
is
like
those
of
his
people
only
larger
the
western
shore
is
governed
by
another
malek
whose
village
lies
higher
up
the
river
than
the
emplacement
of
our
camp
the
population
of
nousreddin
and
the
villages
adjoining
is
considerable
the
country
is
fertile
and
well
cultivated
and
abounds
in
durra
cotton
barley
fine
horses
camels
dromedaries
kine
sheep
goats
and
fowls
as
does
all
the
country
of
berber
i
found
in
these
villages
some
caravan
merchants
who
at
present
had
nothing
to
sell
but
coarse
cotton
cloths
these
cotton
cloths
form
the
only
clothing
of
the
inhabitants
both
men
and
women
wear
them
wrapped
round
their
middle
with
one
end
thrown
over
the
shoulder
or
head
the
berber
though
resembling
the
fellah
of
upper
egypt
in
complexion
is
generally
not
so
well
formed
in
figure
and
feature
many
of
them
have
defective
teeth
probably
occasioned
by
the
habit
of
chewing
bad
tobacco
of
which
they
have
plenty
which
is
common
here
the
greater
part
of
their
household
and
field
work
is
done
by
slaves
they
purchase
from
the
caravans
coming
either
from
abyssinia
or
darfour
some
of
the
owners
of
female
slaves
would
for
a
dollar
without
scruple
permit
the
soldiers
of
our
camp
to
sleep
with
them
the
women
of
berber
contrary
to
the
custom
in
egypt
go
with
the
face
unveiled
without
embarrassment
both
men
and
women
never
consider
themselves
in
full
dress
unless
the
hair
of
the
head
has
been
combed
sleek
then
braided
and
platted
together
and
afterwards
plentifully
anointed
with
butter
they
never
cut
the
hair
i
believe
it
consequently
forms
an
immense
bunch
behind
the
head
similar
to
that
observable
in
some
of
the
ancient
statues
of
egypt
the
barbarous
practice
of
excision
is
universally
performed
upon
all
their
females
whether
free
or
slaves
as
is
the
case
also
among
all
the
tribes
inhabiting
the
banks
of
the
nile
above
assuan
the
people
of
berber
are
in
their
exterior
deportment
mild
and
polite
every
man
we
meet
uniformly
gives
us
the
greeting
of
peace
salaam
aleikoum
and
uniformly
shows
a
disposition
to
accommodate
us
in
every
thing
reasonable
this
is
probably
owing
to
their
being
in
a
very
considerable
degree
a
commercial
people
berber
being
every
year
visited
and
traversed
by
numerous
caravans
from
abyssinia
sennaar
darfour
and
kordofan
of
jamisalachar
this
day
arrived
the
divan
effendi
from
shendi
accompanied
by
the
malek
of
that
province
and
the
son
of
malek
shouus
the
chief
of
the
fugitive
shageias
the
malek
of
shendi
was
accompanied
by
a
considerable
suite
and
two
most
beautiful
horses
intended
as
a
present
to
the
pasha
on
being
introduced
to
his
excellence
he
kissed
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
forehead
and
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
surrender
himself
and
his
country
to
his
favor
and
protection
his
excellence
received
him
graciously
presented
him
with
splendid
habiliments
and
a
horse
richly
caparisoned
after
his
presentation
was
finished
he
was
conducted
to
the
tent
of
the
hasnardar
who
was
directed
by
the
pasha
to
treat
him
with
due
hospitality
the
son
of
malek
shouus
came
in
behalf
of
his
father
and
other
distinguished
chiefs
of
the
shageias
to
implore
the
mercy
of
the
pasha
for
these
chiefs
and
the
fugitive
remnant
of
their
followers
who
were
opposite
shendi
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
pasha
as
to
what
was
to
be
their
fate
i
was
told
that
the
determination
of
the
pasha
continued
in
their
regard
the
same
making
the
surrender
of
their
arms
and
horses
the
sine
qua
non
of
peace
between
him
and
them
three
days
after
the
chief
of
shendi
returned
home
the
friend
of
the
pasha
on
the
of
the
moon
i
passed
over
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
to
purchase
camels
as
there
were
many
buyers
at
this
time
from
our
camp
i
did
not
find
any
good
enough
for
the
exorbitant
price
demanded
i
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
the
night
following
at
the
town
of
nousreddin
in
the
house
of
one
of
the
principal
chiefs
of
the
berbers
he
bears
the
title
of
malek
as
do
all
the
distinguished
chiefs
of
berber
shageia
and
dongola
their
dignity
is
hereditary
generally
passing
from
father
to
son
i
have
noticed
that
the
families
of
the
maleks
exceed
the
common
people
in
respect
of
stature
and
stoutness
the
malek
in
whose
house
i
lodged
a
man
about
years
of
age
was
near
seven
feet
high
and
very
stout
his
eldest
son
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
was
about
feet
inches
in
stature
stout
and
well
proportioned
i
imagine
that
this
superiority
in
size
is
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
they
eat
well
and
heartily
and
have
no
work
to
do
beside
seeing
that
others
work
for
them
the
family
of
this
malek
carried
their
hospitality
towards
me
to
a
very
extraordinary
length
for
people
professing
islam
i
was
offered
by
the
mother
and
mistress
of
the
house
my
choice
of
two
of
her
daughters
for
a
bedfellow
they
were
both
young
and
the
handsomest
women
i
have
seen
in
berber
but
married
to
husbands
whose
houses
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
when
i
understood
this
circumstance
i
told
the
mother
that
a
genuine
mussulman
ought
to
regard
lying
with
his
neighbor
wife
as
a
crime
almost
as
bad
as
murdering
him
in
his
bed
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
say
that
though
the
berbers
are
a
quiet
and
industrious
people
very
civil
and
disposed
to
oblige
all
for
whom
they
have
any
regard
yet
with
respect
to
their
women
they
appear
to
be
unconscious
that
their
conduct
is
quite
irreconcilable
with
the
precepts
of
the
koran
and
the
customs
of
their
they
suffer
them
to
go
about
with
the
face
exposed
to
converse
with
the
other
sex
in
the
roads
the
streets
and
the
fields
and
if
the
women
are
accustomed
to
grant
their
favors
to
their
countrymen
as
liberally
and
as
frequently
as
they
did
to
our
soldiers
i
should
imagine
that
it
must
be
more
than
commonly
difficult
in
this
country
for
a
man
to
know
his
own
father
on
my
return
to
camp
i
was
amused
on
the
way
by
a
dispute
in
connection
with
this
subject
between
the
malek
i
have
mentioned
and
a
soldier
it
happened
in
the
boat
that
brought
me
back
to
camp
the
boat
was
heavily
laden
and
this
gigantic
malek
was
stepping
into
it
when
the
soldier
i
have
mentioned
intimated
a
determination
to
exclude
him
calling
him
by
several
opprobrious
names
and
among
other
terms
a
pimp
upon
this
i
checked
the
soldier
telling
him
that
this
man
was
a
considerable
personage
in
his
country
and
extremely
hospitable
to
the
osmanlis
this
mollified
the
soldier
and
the
malek
took
a
place
as
well
as
he
could
the
malek
then
addressed
the
soldier
in
a
mild
manner
and
asked
him
why
he
had
bestowed
such
appellations
upon
one
who
was
a
mussulman
as
well
as
himself
the
soldier
positively
refused
to
allow
the
malek
claims
to
this
honorable
appellation
the
chief
demanded
upon
what
grounds
the
soldier
denied
it
because
said
the
soldier
the
women
of
your
country
are
all
whores
and
the
men
all
get
drunk
with
bouza
araky
and
other
forbidden
liquors
which
you
make
out
of
durra
and
dates
and
turning
to
me
he
demanded
whether
he
was
not
right
the
poor
chief
appeared
to
be
much
vexed
that
he
was
unable
to
reply
to
this
accusation
and
remained
silent
the
soldier
not
content
with
humbling
the
unlucky
malek
pursued
his
advantage
without
mercy
come
said
he
to
the
chief
i
do
not
believe
that
you
know
any
thing
about
your
religion
and
i
will
soon
make
you
sensible
of
it
he
then
asked
the
chief
how
many
prophets
had
preceded
mohammed
if
he
knew
any
thing
about
the
history
of
dhulkamein
and
gog
and
magog
and
many
others
of
a
similar
tenor
how
to
answer
which
the
unfortunate
malek
was
obliged
to
own
his
ignorance
the
soldier
then
told
him
that
the
commander
of
the
faithful
the
chief
of
the
mussulmans
had
authorized
his
vizier
the
pasha
mehemmed
ali
to
set
the
people
on
the
upper
parts
of
the
nile
to
rights
and
that
now
the
osmanlis
were
come
among
them
they
would
probably
learn
how
to
behave
themselves
the
malek
might
however
have
had
his
revenge
upon
the
edifying
soldier
had
he
known
as
well
as
i
did
that
he
had
gone
over
to
the
town
of
nousreddin
expressly
to
amuse
himself
with
the
women
of
the
country
and
had
doubtless
paid
as
much
attention
to
the
bouza
as
the
most
sturdy
toper
in
berber
the
country
of
the
berbers
after
the
best
in
formation
i
have
been
able
to

it

the
succession
of

the

are
built
of
clay
covered
with
a
flat
roof
of
beams
overlaid
generally
with
straw
but
the
houses
of
the
maleks
have
generally
terraced
roofs
of
beaten
clay
this
manner
of
building
is
sufficient
in
a
country
where
no
great
quantity
of
rain
falls
throughout
the
year
some
of
the
houses
of
the
peasants
are
formed
of
trusses
of
cornstalks
and
placed
side

in
a
perpendicular

with

of
the

materials
all
the
people
sleep
upon
bedsteads
as
they
do
also
in
dongola
and
shageia
these
bedsteads
are
composed
of
an
oblong
frame
of
wood
standing
on
four
short
legs
the
sides
of
the
frame
supporting
a
close
network
of
leathern
thongs
on

the

sleeps
it

berber
contains
plenty
of
salt
which
the
natives
find
in
some
calcareous
mountains
between
the
desert
and
the
fertile
land
in
its
natural
state
it
is
found
mingled
with
a
brown
earth
with
which
the
stone
of
those
mountains
is
intermixed
this
earth
the
natives
dilute
with
water
which
absorbs
the
salt
and
leaves
the
earth
at
the
bottom
they
then
pour
off
the
water
into
another
vessel
and
by
exposing
it
to
the
sun
or
fire
the
water
is
evaporated
and
the
salt
remains
the
assemblage
of
villages
which
compose
the
capital
of
nousreddin
contains
houses
enough
for
a
population
of
five
or
six
thousand
souls
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
actual
population
of
those
villages
is
so
great
the
language
is
arabic
perfectly
intelligible
to
the
natives
of
egypt
but
containing
some
ancient
words
at
present
disused
on

for
instance
the
berber
calls
a

as
to
the
climate
the
difference
between
the
heat
at

hours
afternoon
in
the
month
of
the
vernal
equinox
and
at
an
hour
before
sunrise
has
been
as
great
as
ten
degrees
of
the

of

as
i
have
been
informed
by
one
of
the
medical
staff
attached
to
the

was
in

of
that

it
is
at

the
commencement

the
heat
at

at

to
the
sense
is
as
great
as
in
the
month
of
the
summer
solstice
in
cairo
i
have
seen
no
ferocious
animals
either
in
berber
or
the
country

that
they

berber
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
remainder
of
the

provisions
and

from
the
boats
at

the
reason
why
these
have
not
been
transported
hither
before
this
time
is
the
want
of
camels
a
large
part
of
the

of

he
brought
with
him
as
a

very
large
man
about
sixty
years
of

two
days
after
having
occasion
to
go
to
the
other
side
of

i
found
nousreddin
upon
the
shore
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
boat
to
carry
him
and
some
of
his
chiefs
over
i
paid
him
some
compliments
relative
to
the
handsome
horses
he
had
presented
to
the
pasha
which
pleased
him
considerably
he
invited
me
to
come
to
his
house
and
partake
of
his
hospitality
i
told
him
if
circumstances
would
admit
it
i
would
visit
him
in
a
few
days
from
the
of
regeb
to
the
end
of
the

nothing
worth
notice
took
place
except
the
successive
and
gradual
arrival
of
the
remainder
of
the
cannon
ammunition
stores
and
troops
from
the
cataract
which
had
been
left
there
when
the

quitted
it
for
want
of

to
transport
them
on
the
last
day
of
the

arrived
the
cavalry
of
ibrihim

from

consisting
of
four
hundred
excellent
horsemen
one
thousand

on

is
at

severely
sick
on
the
of
the
moon
shaban
shortly
after
the
hour
of
afternoon
prayer
the
signal
was
fired
and
the
tents
fell
we
mounted
our
snorting
horses
now
lusty
from
long
repose
and
commenced
our
march
to
traverse
the
famous
country
of
the
ethiopian
shepherds
at
present
subject
to
the
malek
of
shendi
we
arrived
opposite
shendi
by
easy
marches
in
eight
days
and
encamped
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
near
a
very
large
village
called
shendi
el
garb
shendi
on
the
west
bank
our
route
from
berber
led
us
through
a
country
consisting
of
immense
plains
of
fertile
soil
extending
many
miles
from
the
river
and
mostly
covered
with
herbage
mountains
or
hills
were
rarely
visible
we
passed
many
large
villages
most
of
which
stood
far
off
from
the
river
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
inundation
the
houses
of
these
villages
particularly
as
we
approached
shendi
were
generally
built
with
sloping
roofs
of
thatched
straw
which
indicated
that
this
is
a
country
visited
by
the
rains
we
hardly
ever
during
our
march
came
in
view
of
the
river
except
to
encamp
we
found
it
at
this
season
narrow
and
shallow
though
its
bed
was
frequently
a
mile
and
a
half
broad
at
every
halt
we
made
the
chiefs
of
the
country
came
to
salute
the
pasha
and
seemed
to
be
well
disposed
towards
the
army
whose
conduct
was
very
exemplary
on
the
of
the
moon
i
visited
the
town
of
shendi
el
garb
in
the
rear
of
our
camp
it
is
large
and
well
built
in
comparison
with
the
other
villages
i
have
seen
on
the
upper
nile
it
contains
about
six
thousand
inhabitants
and
has
three
market
places
where
the
people
of
the
country
exchange
dollars
and
durra
for
what
they
have
need
of
our
piasters
they
disliked
being
ignorant
of
their
value
but
sometimes
received
them
for
fowls
vegetables
butter
and
meat
and
for
durra
but
for
wheat
they
demanded
dollars
on
the
of
the
moon
i
went
to
shendi
on
the
east
bank
which
is
the
capital
of
the
country
i
traversed
the
town
with
some
surprise
the
houses
are
low
but
well
built
of
clay
large
areas
walled
in
for
the
reception
of
the
merchandize
brought
by
the
caravans
are
to
be
seen
in
various
parts
of
the
town
which
is
large
containing
probably
five
or
six
thousand
inhabitants
the
streets
are
wide
and
airy
regular
market
places
are
found
there
where
beside
meat
butter
grain
and
vegetables
are
also
to
be
purchased
spices
brought
from
jidda
gum
arabic
beads
and
other
ornaments
for
the
women
the
people
of
shendi
have
a
bad
character
being
both
ferocious
and
fraudulent
great
numbers
of
slaves
of
both
sexes
from
abyssinia
and
darfour
are
to
be
found
here
at
a
moderate
price
a
handsome
abyssinian
girl
selling
for
about
forty
or
fifty
dollars
the
chief
of
shendi
the
same
who
had
come
to
our
camp
in
berber
has
done
his
uttermost
to
promote
a
good
disposition
in
his
people
towards
the
osmanlis
and
has
made
the
pasha
a
present
of
several
hundreds
of
very
fine
camels
within
the
last
two
days
his
house
is
not
built
of
better
materials
than
those
of
his
people
and
differs
from
them
only
in
being
larger
shendi
stands
about
half
a
mile
from
the
easterly
bank
of
the
river
its
immediate
environs
are
sandy
it
derives
its
importance
solely
from
being
the
rendezvous
of
the
caravans
of
sennaar
and
the
neighboring
countries
going
to
mecca
or
egypt
the
territory
belonging
to
the
chief
of
shendi
is
said
to
be
very
large
but
by
no
means
peopled
in
proportion
to
its
extent
he
can
however
in
conjunction
with
the
malek
of
halfya
bring
into
the
field
thirty
thousand
horsemen
mounted
on
steeds
probably
as
beautiful
as
any
found
in
any
country
in
the
world
on
the
of
the
moon
some
soldiers
who
went
to
a
village
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
camp
to
get
their
rations
of
durra
from
the
magazine
in
this
village
which
had
been
formed
there
by
its
chief
for
the
service
of
the
army
were
insulted
maltreated
and
two
of
them
killed
outright
with
lances
and
others
severely
wounded
by
the
inhabitants
on
the
news
of
this
outrage
reaching
the
camp
the
soldiers
took
arms
and
mounted
to
proceed
to
this
village
with
the
full
determination
to
revenge
the
death
of
their
comrades
in
the
severest
manner
in
five
minutes
nearly
all
the
camp
was
upon
the
march
for
this
village
when
the
pasha
sent
orders
to
stop
them
and
leave
the
affair
to
him
it
was
however
impossible
to
prevent
the
greater
part
of
them
from
proceeding
to
the
village
which
they
pillaged
and
destroyed
sacrificing
to
their
fury
many
of
its
inhabitants
the
plunder
which
they
brought
back
was
however
seized
by
the
selictar
and
by
the
orders
restored
to
its
owners
the
conduct
of
his
excellence
on
this
occasion
was
highly
laudable
while
it
must
be
confessed
that
that
of
the
soldiers
was
not
much
to
be
blamed
durra
a
miserable
pittance
of
durra
scarcely
sufficient
to
support
nature
was
all
that
was
required
from
the
people
of
these
countries
money
free
and
this
in
the
instance
mentioned
was
refused
by
a
people
whose
chief
had
already
granted
it
a
people
absolutely
within
our
power
and
who
extorted
from
the
starving
soldiery
enormous
prices
for
every
thing
they
sold
us
and
who
frequently
refused
to
sell
us
any
thing
at
all
with
great
ferocity
and
insolence
on
the
of
the
moon
at
two
hours
before
sunset
the
signal
was
fired
and
the
camp
of
the
pasha
rose
to
commence
its
march
for
sennaar
we
marched
till
midnight
and
reposed
as
usual
on
the
bank
of
the
river
till
about
the
same
hour
of
the
afternoon
of
the
of
the
moon
when
we
pursued
our
march
for
five
hours
and
halted
by
the
river
we
stayed
here
till
the
in
the
afternoon
in
order
to
obtain
three
days
rations
for
the
horses
from
the
villages
in
the
neighborhood
which
are
numerous
and
large
as
the
country
through
which
our
route
would
lie
for
that
time
is
destitute
of
inhabitants
and
cultivation
it
was
on
the
that
malek
shouus
the
chief
of
the
fugitive
shageias
who
had
fled
as
the
army
approached
up
the
country
came
at
length
to
the
camp
to
surrender
himself
to
the
discretion
of
the
pasha
he
addressed
the
pasha
as
i
have
been
informed
as
follows
i
have
fought
against
you
to
the
utmost
of
my
means
and
power
and
am
now
ready
if
you
will
to
fight
under
the
orders
of
my
conqueror
the
courage
this
man
had
shown
in
battle
and
his
firmness
in
adversity
had
engaged
the
respect
of
the
osmanlis
and
he
is
as
graciously
received
by
the
pasha
who
created
him
a
bimbashi
and
received
him
his
companions
and
followers
into
his
service
malek
shouus
is
a
large
stout
man
of
a
pleasing
physiognomy
though
black
of
about
forty
years
of
age
and
was
considered
as
the
greatest
warrior
among
the
people
of
the
upper
nile
who
all
stood
in
awe
of
him
the
and
of
the
moon
were
employed
in
traversing
the
naked
country
which
is
barren
rocky
and
without
cultivation
we
marched
for
three
days
from
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
till
midnight
it
was
not
till
the
second
hour
after
midnight
however
of
the
third
day
that
we
arrived
at
a
country
on
the
border
of
the
nile
containing
several
villages
where
we
remained
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
of
the
on
our
arrival
at
these
villages
the
darkness
and
severe
hunger
engaged
several
of
the
soldiers
to
take
by
force
sheep
and
goats
from
the
inhabitants
the
officers
of
the
pasha
vigorously
interposed
to
prevent
this
infraction
of
the
orders
of
his
excellence
and
several
of
the
guilty
were
severely
punished
for
taking
forbidden
means
to
gratify
the
demands
of
nature
at
the
hour
of
afternoon
prayer
the
signal
was
fired
and
the
camp
proceeded
onwards
we
left
the
villages
and
passed
through
a
sandy
tract
covered
with
bushes
and
the
thorny
acacia
which
embarrassed
our
march
and
by
occasioning
several
detours
caused
the
army
to
lose
its
way
after
wandering
about
till
midnight
the
camp
at
length
arrived
on
the
bank
of
the
nile
on
the
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
the
camp
proceeded
and
halted
in
the
forenoon
on
the
beach
of
the
river
opposite
halfya
a
very
large
village
on
the
easterly
bank
we
stayed
here
till
the
to
obtain
durra
from
this
territory
whose
chief
brought
as
a
present
to
the
pasha
some
fine
horses
and
many
camels
and
received
in
return
some
valuable
presents
our
side
of
the

desert
and
covered
with
trees
and
bushes
during
our
stay
opposite

the
night

suddenly
about
two
feet
and
inundated
some
parts
of
the

we
were
encamped

entering
the

it
had
risen
a
little
shortly
after
the
equinox
while
the
army
was
in
berber
and
afterwards
subsided
more
than
it
had
risen
we
find
the

every

more
and
more
overcast

accompanied
with
violent

which
have
overset

within
a

frequent
and
drops
of

have
fallen
in
our
camp
on
the
at
one
hour
after

we
proceeded
to
the
bahar

about
five
hours
march
above
our
present
position
where
the
pasha
intends
to
cross
into
the
territory
of

the
camp
arrived
at
sunset
at
a
position
a
little
above
where
the
nile
falls
into
the
bahar
el

and
stopped
immediately
on
my
arrival
i
drank
of
this
river
being
probably
the
first
man
of
frank
origin
that
ever
tasted
its
waters
the
nile
is
not
half
as
broad
as
the
bahar
el
abiud
which
is
from
bank
to
bank
one
mile
higher
than
where
the
nile
joins
it
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
breadth
it
comes
as
far
as
we
can
see
it
from
the
the
nile
of
bruce
must
therefore
after
the
expedition
of
ismael
pasha
be
considered
as
a
branch
of
a
great
and
unexplored
river
which
may
possibly
be
found
to
be
connected
with
the
niger
on
the
early
in
the
morning
the
pasha
commenced
transporting
the
army
over
the
bahar
el
abiud
by
means
of
nine
small
boats
which
had
been
able
to
pass
the
third
cataract
and
follow
the
army
the
country
on
our
side
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
is
uncultivated
and
apparently
without
inhabitants
the
army
is
encamped
by
the
side
of
the
river
on
a
beautiful
plain
of
good
soil
extending
a
considerable
distance
back
towards
the
desert
during
the
inundation
this
plain
becomes
evidently
an
island
as
there
is
a
channel
worn
by
water
in
the
rear
of
it
at
this
season
dry
the
tracks
of
the
hippopotamus
are
found
throughout
this
plain
by
the
in
the
afternoon
in
two
days
and
a
half
the
pasha
had
finished
transporting
into
sennaar
the
whole
of
his
camp
consisting
of
about
six
thousand
persons
with
the
artillery
ammunition
tents
baggage
horses
camels
and
asses
by
the
aid
of
nine
boats
none
of
them
large
an
expedition
i
believe
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
turkish
warfare
during
our
stay
on
the
other
side
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
it
was
reported
in
the
camp
that
some
of
the
mogrebin
soldiers
gone
out
to
shoot
gazelles
had
killed
in
the
desert
which
lies
off
from
the
river
an
animal
resembling
a
bull
except
that
its
feet
were
like
those
of
a
camel
i
did
not
see
this
animal
but
the
story
was
affirmed
to
me
by
several
the
army
on
its
crossing
the
bahar
el
abiud
encamped
on
the
point
of
land
just
below
which
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
the
nile
join
each
other
the
water
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
is
troubled
and
whitish
and
has
a
peculiar
sweetish
taste
the
soldiers
said
that
the
water
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
would
not
quench
thirst
this
notion
probably
arose
from
the
circumstance
that
they
were
never
tired
of
drinking
it
it
is
so
light
and
sweet
the
water
of
the
nile
is
at
present
perfectly
pure
and
transparent
but
by
no
means
so
agreeable
to
the
palate
as
that
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
as
i
experimented
myself
drinking
first
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
then
walking
about
two
hundred
yards
across
the
point
and
drinking
of
the
nile
the
water
of
which
appeared
to
me
hard
and
tasteless
in
comparison
nothing
of
the
kind
could
be
easier
than
to
ascend
the
bahar
el
abiud
from
the
place
where
we
are
a
canja
well
manned
and
armed
and
accompanied
by
another
boat
containing
provisions
for
four
or
six
months
and
both
furnished
with
grapnels
to
enable
them
at
night
to
anchor
in
the
river
might
in
my
opinion
ascend
and
return
securely
as
the
tribes
on
its
borders
have
great
dread
of
and
will
hardly
dare
to
meddle
with
those
who
carry
them
we
stayed
on
the
sennaar
side
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
till
the
of
ramadan
when
the
army
commenced
its
march
for
sennaar
the
capital
proceeding
by
the
bank
of
the
nile
the
army
reached
sennaar
in
thirteen
days
the
signal
for
striking
the
tents
and
loading
the
camels
was
generally
fired
about
two
hours
after
midnight
one
hour
was
allowed
for
loading
the
baggage
when
a
second
cannon
was
fired
and
the
march
of
the
army
commenced
and
was
continued
each
day
till
about
two
or
three
hours
before
noon
when
the
camp
reposed
till
about
two
hours
after
midnight
of
the
same
day
the
army
suffered
severely
during
this
march
nothing
was
given
to
the
troops
for
subsistence
but
durra
unground
which
the
soldiers
were
frequently
in
great
distress
to
obtain
the
means
of
making
into
meal
in
order
to
bake
a
little
miserable
bread
which
was
all
they
had
to
eat
for
myself
i
was
reduced
to
great
extremity
the
camel
carrying
my
provisions
and
culinary
utensils
and
several
other
articles
was
lost
by
the
carelessness
of
a
domestic
i
was
consequently
left
without
any
thing
to
eat
or
the
means
of
preparing
what
i
might
obtain
i
threw
myself
under
the
hospitable
shade
of
the
tent
of
caillaud
then
only
occupied
by
mr
constant
his
companion
the
gentleman
i
have
mentioned
in
the
preface
with
so
much
well
merited
esteem
where
i
stayed
till
my
arrival
at
sennaar
the
country
we
traversed
is
that
part
of
the
kingdom
of
sennaar
which
lies
between
the
nile
and
the
bahar
el
abiud
it
is
an
immense
and
fertile
plain
occupied
by
numerous
villages
some
of
them
very
large
that
of
wahat
medinet
for
instance
containing
probably
four
or
five
thousand
inhabitants
what
country
we
saw
was
at
this
season
perfectly
naked
of
grass
consisting
generally
of
immense
fields
which
in
the
season
past
had
been
planted
with
durra
acacia
trees
and
bushes
in
the
country
far
back
from
the
river
which
is
sandy
were
abundant
but
no
herbage
was
visible
i
did
not
see
throughout
our
route
a
single
waterwheel
and
i
believe
that
the
country
is
only
cultivated
when
the
inundation
has
retired
the
houses
of
the
villages
are
built
in
the
following
manner
a
circle
of
stakes
is
planted
in
the
ground
a
conical
frame
of
poles
attached
to
these
stakes
below
and
meeting
and
fastened
at
the
top
of
the
cone
forms
the
roof
this
roof
and
the
sides
of
the
house
are
then
covered
with
thatched
straw
which
suffices
to
exclude
the
rains
some
of
the
houses
however
belonging
to
the
chiefs
are
of
a
stronger
fabric
being
composed
of
thick
walls
made
of
bricks
dried
in
the
sun
and
having
terraced
roofs
in
the
thatched
cottages
i
have
mentioned
the
air
and
light
come
in
by
the
doorway
and
four
small
holes
pierced
in
the
walls
of
the
house
this
scanty
ventilation
renders
these
cottages
very
hot
and
close
the
difference
between
the
temperature
of
an
inhabited
house
and
that
of
the
air
outside
being
in
my
judgment
almost
as
great
as
that
of
the
undressing
room
of
a
bath
at
cairo
and
that
of
the
passage
just
outside
of
the
bath
itself
this
circumstance
alone
is
almost
sufficient
to
account
for
the
great
mortality
in
sennaar
during
the
rainy
season
when
whole
families
are
shut
up
in
these
close
cottages
and
every
one
who
goes
abroad
must
necessarily
go
with
his
pores
in
a
condition
expressly
adapted
to
make
him
catch
a
cold
or
a
fever
six
days
before
the
army
reached
sennaar
the
pasha
was
met
by
an
ambassador
from
the
sultan
he
had
an
audience
of
his
excellence
and
returned
the
next
day
to
sennaar
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
accompanied
by
a
numerous
suite
mounted
on
dromedaries
the
army
pursued
its
route
steadily
marching
in
order
of
battle
the
infantry
in
the
centre
the
cavalry
on
the
wings
the
artillery
in
advance
of
the
centre
and
the
baggage
in
the
rear
with
shouus
cavalry
and
the
dromedary
corps
of
abbadies
scouring
our
front
and
flanks
to
a
great
distance
two
days
after
it
was
reported
in
the
camp
that
the
sultan
of
sennaar
was
on
his
way
to
meet
us
with
a
strong
force
preceded
by
numerous
elephants
and
great
herds
of
cattle
collected
in
order
to
receive
and
exhaust
the
fire
of
our
troops
the
pasha
proceeded
however
steadily
on
with
the
army
in
order
of
battle
and
equally
prepared
for
peace
or
war
two
days
before
the
arrival
of
the
army
in
sennaar
as
i
was
riding
near
the
topgi
bashi
who
was
in
front
of
the
army
with
the
artillery
i
saw
a
great
number
of
armed
men
approaching
mounted
on
horses
and
dromedaries
presently
the
malek
of
shendi
who
had
accompanied
the
pasha
rode
up
to
the
pasha
and
informed
him
that
the
strangers
approaching
were
the
principal
officers
of
the
sultan
of
sennaar
and
their
suite
who
had
come
to
demand
terms
of
peace
i
saw
these
personages
when
they
arrived
they
were
two
one
a
tall
thin
elderly
man
of
a
mulatto
complexion
dressed
in
green
and
yellow
silks
of
costly
fabric
with
a
cap
of
a
singular
form
something
resembling
a
crown
made
of
the
same
materials
upon
his
head
the
other
was
the
same
young
man
who
had
come
a
few
days
past
to
the
pasha
he
was
dressed
in
silks
like
the
other
except
that
his
head
was
bare
of
ornament
they
were
accompanied
by
a
fine
lad
about
sixteen
who
was
it
is
said
the
son
of
the
predecessor
of
the
present
sultan
all
three
were
mounted
on
tall
and
beautiful
horses
and
accompanied
by
about
two
hundred
soldiers
of
the
sultan
mounted
on
dromedaries
and
armed
with
broadswords
lances
and
shields
when
the
pasha
was
informed
of
their
approach
by
the
malek
of
shendi
he
ordered
a
halt
the
tent
of
the
pasha
was
pitched
and
the
ambassadors
were
introduced
they
were
treated
with
great
attention
and
liberality
by
the
pasha
who
during
the
day
and
the
course
of
the
evening
following
gave
them
opportunities
enough
to
be
convinced
of
the
immense
superiority
of
our
arms
to
theirs
during
the
evening
some
star
rockets
and
bombs
were
thrown
for
their
amusement
and
edification
no
language
can
do
justice
to
their
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
which
undoubtedly
produced
the
effect
intended
by
the
pasha
humility
and
a
sense
of
inferiority
the
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
the
army
pursued
its
march
accompanied
by
the
ambassadors
from
sennaar
about
the
hour
of
noon
the
outscouts
announced
to
the
pasha
that
the
sultan
of
sennaar
himself
was
approaching
to
salute
his
excellence
on
his
approach
the
army
received
him
with
the
honors
due
to
his
rank
he
was
conducted
to
the
tent
of
the
pasha
by
the
ambassadors
he
had
sent
where
he
remained
in
audience
with
his
excellence
a
long
time
when
the
audience
was
finished
he
and
the
personages
he
had
before
sent
to
the
pasha
were
splendidly
habited
in
the
turkish
fashion
and
presented
with
horses
furnished
with
saddles
and
bridles
embroidered
with
gold
it
was
on
the
morning
following
that
the
army
reached
the
capital
we
marched
in
order
of
battle
the
pasha
accompanied
by
the
sultan
of
sennaar
and
his
chief
servants
in
front
on
approaching
the
city
the
army
saluted
this
long
wished
for
town
where
they
imagined
that
their
toils
and
privations
would
cease
at
least
for
a
time
with
repeated
and
continued
volleys
of
cannon
and
musquetry
accompanied
with
shouts
of
exultation
but
these
shouts
subsided
on
a
nearer
approach
on
finding
this
once
powerful
city
of
sennaar
to
be
almost
nothing
but
heaps
of
ruins
containing
in
some
of
its
quarters
some
few
hundreds
of
habitable
but
almost
deserted
houses
after
the
camp
was
pitched
and
i
had
refreshed
myself
with
a
little
food
i
took
a
walk
about
the
town
at
almost
every
step
i
trod
upon
fragments
of
burnt
bricks
among
which
are
frequently
to
be
found
fragments
of
porcelain
and
sometimes
marble
the
most
conspicuous
buildings
in
sennaar
are
a
mosque
and
a
large
brick
palace
adjoining
it
the
mosque
which
is
of
brick
is
in
good
preservation
its
windows
are
covered
with
well
wrought
bronze
gratings
and
the
doors
are
handsomely
and
curiously
carved
the
interior
was
desecrated
by
uncouth
figures
of
animals
portrayed
upon
the
walls
with
charcoal
this
profanation
had
been
perpetrated
by
the
pagan
mountaineers
who
inhabit
the
mountains
thirteen
days
march
south
of
sennaar
and
who
at
some
period
not
very
long
past
had
taken
the
town
and
had
left
upon
the
walls
of
the
mosque
these
tokens
of
possession
the
palace
is
large
but
in
ruins
except
the
centre
building
which
is
six
stories
high
having
five
rows
of
windows
by
mounting
upon
its
roof
you
have
the
best
possible
view
of
the
city
the
river
and
the
environs
that
the
place
can
afford
i
judged
that
sennaar
was
about
three
miles
in
circumference
the
greater
part
of
this
space
is
now
covered
with
the
ruins
of
houses
built
of
bricks
either
burnt
or
dried
in
the
sun
i
do
not
believe
that
there
are
more
than
four
hundred
houses
standing
in
sennaar
and
of
these
or
more
are
round
cottages
like
those
of
the
villages
of
those
built
of
bricks
the
largest
is
the
house
of
the
sultan
it
is
a
large
enclosure
containing
ranges
of
low
but
well
built
habitations
of
bricks
with
terraced
roofs
and
the
interior
stuccoed
with
fine
clay
what
struck
me
the
most
was
the
workmanship
of
the
doors
of
the
old
houses
of
sennaar
which
are
composed
of
planed
and
jointed
planks
adorned
frequently
with
carved
work
and
strengthened
and
studded
with
very
broad
headed
nails
the
whole
inimitable
by
the
present
population
of
sennaar
these
houses
are
very
rarely
of
more
than
one
story
in
height
the
roofs
terraced
with
fine
and
well
beaten
clay
spread
over
mats
laid
upon
rafters
which
form
the
roof
the
city
of
sennaar
is
of
an
oblong
form
its
longest
side
opposite
the
river
it
stands
not
at
any
distance
from
the
river
but
directly
upon
its
west
bank
which
consists
hereabouts
of
hard
clay
the
river
is
now
rising
but
exhibits
itself
at
present
to
the
view
as
narrow
and
winding
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
between
sand
flats
which
will
shortly
be
covered
by
its
augmenting
waters
the
bed
of
the
nile
opposite
sennaar
may
be
reckoned
at
about
half
a
mile
broad
the
environs
of
sennaar
are
wide
plains
containing
large
and
populous
villages
a
long
ragged
mountain
the
only
one
visible
stands
about
fifteen
miles
to
the
west
of
the
town
below
the
town
is
a
small
but
pretty
island
whose
inhabitants
thrive
by
raising
vegetables
for
the
market
of
sennaar
and
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
presents
several
verdant
patches
of
ground
devoted
to
the
same
object
beyond
these
spots
the
country
on
the
other
bank
appeared
to
be
mostly
covered
with
trees
and
bushes
among
which
i
saw
four
elephants
feeding
i
could
not
find
any
remains
of
any
very
ancient
building
in
sennaar
during
my
stay
and
i
believe
that
none
exists
there
such
is
the
present
appearance
of
a
town
which
has
evidently
been
once
rich
comfortable
and
nourishing
but
which
for
eighteen
years
past
as
i
have
been
informed
has
been
the
lacerated
prey
of
war
and
confusion
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
the
conditions
of
the
accord
between
the
pasha
and
the
sultan
of
sennaar
were
arranged
and
sealed
by
which
the
latter
recognized
himself
as
subject
and
feudatory
of
the
grand
seignor
and
surrendered
his
dominions
to
the
supremacy
and
sway
of
the
vizier
of
the
padischah
mehemmed
ali
pasha
the
next
day
the
tchocadar
aga
of
his
highness
the
viceroy
of
egypt
who
had
arrived
in
our
camp
two
months
past
embarked
in
the
canja
of
the
pasha
ismael
to
carry
the
documents
of
this
important
transaction
to
cairo
for
several
days
after
our
arrival
at
sennaar
our
camp
was
incommoded
by
furious
squalls
of
wind
accompanied
with
thunder
lightning
and
torrents
of
rain
the
pasha
therefore
determined
to
caserne
the
troops
in
the
houses
of
the
town
and
to
stay
there
during
the
rainy
season
in
ten
days
after
our
arrival
the
army
was
distributed
throughout
the
town
and
in
the
villages
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
the
pasha
himself
took
up
his
quarters
in
a
large
house
of
the
sultan
of
sennaar
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
accommodation
a
few
days
after
our
arrival
a
slave
informed
the
pasha
that
the
sultan
of
sennaar
before
our
arrival
had
thrown
into
the
river
some
cannon
the
pasha
ordered
search
to
be
made
four
iron
guns
were
discovered
by
divers
and
were
dragged
on
shore
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
ordinary
ship
guns
no
mark
or
inscription
was
found
on
them
to
enable
me
to
judge
where
they
were
fabricated
i
believe
them
however
to
have
been
originally
obtained
of
the
portuguese
by
the
abyssinians
from
whom
the
people
said
the
sultan
of
sennaar
had
taken
them
in
some
ancient
war
between
the
two
kingdoms
on
the
of
ramadan
a
party
of
bedouins
were
ordered
by
the
pasha
to
go
in
pursuit
of
some
hundred
black
slaves
of
the
sultan
of
sennaar
who
some
time
before
our
arrival
had
run
away
taking
with
them
some
of
his
best
horses
on
the
they
returned
bringing
with
them
between
five
and
six
hundred
negroes
of
both
sexes
but
on
malek
shouus
going
to
the
pasha
and
representing
to
him
that
these
people
were
not
the
fugitives
in
question
the
pasha
ordered
them
to
be
immediately
released
and
to
return
to
their
respective
villages
about
the
same
time
the
pasha
detached
cogia
achmet
with
thirteen
hundred
cavalry
and
three
pieces
of
artillery
to
the
upper
country
of
sennaar
between
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
the
nile
to
secure
its
submission
and
on
the
of
the
moon
the
divan
effendi
was
sent
with
three
hundred
men
across
the
nile
to
secure
that
part
of
the
kingdom
of
sennaar
which
lies
on
the
east
side
of
the
nile
seven
days
after
our
arrival
in
sennaar
i
put
in
execution
a
resolution
the
state
of
my
health
obliged
me
to
determine
on
and
demanded
of
the
pasha
permission
to
return
to
cairo
i
represented
to
him
that
all
the
critical
operations
of
the
campaign
were
now
happily
concluded
and
crowned
with
the
fullest
success
and
that
therefore
he
could
have
no
particular
need
of
me
any
longer
i
stated
to
him
that
repeated
sickness
during
the
campaign
had
rendered
my
health
very
infirm
and
that
a
residence
of
four
months
at
sennaar
during
the
rainy
season
would
probably
destroy
me
and
as
my
presence
for
that
time
at
least
could
be
no
ways
necessary
i
requested
him
to
grant
the
permission
demanded
telling
him
that
if
after
the
rainy
season
was
finished
he
should
think
proper
to
recall
me
to
camp
that
i
would
obey
the
summons
the
pasha
hesitated
and
for
several
days
declined
granting
my
request
but
on
its
being
represented
to
him
that
the
reasons
i
had
stated
were
really
just
and
sufficient
causes
for
my
return
his
excellence
finally
told
me
that
on
the
return
of
cogia
achmet
he
should
dispatch
a
courier
to
cairo
and
that
i
should
accompany
him
on
the
third
day
of
the
feast
of
bairam
i
saw
the
sultan
of
sennaar
parade
the
town
in
great
ceremony
he
was
mounted
on
a
superb
horse
and
clothed
in
green
and
yellow
silks
but
his
head
was
bare
of
every
thing
but
its
natural
wool
over
his
head
an
officer
carried
a
large
umbrella
of
green
and
yellow
silks
in
alternate
stripes
he
was
accompanied
by
the
officers
of
his
palace
and
his
guard
beautifully
mounted
and
followed
by
the
native
population
of
sennaar
both
men
and
women
who
uttered
shrill
cries
which
were
now
and
then
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
most
lugubrious
trumpet
which
preceded
the
sultan
and
which
was
blown
by
a
musician
who
judging
from
the
tones
he
produced
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
a
bad
cough
on
the
of
the
moon
shawal
the
divan
effendi
returned
to
sennaar
having
crushed
all
attempts
to
oppose
the
establishment
of
the
authority
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
kingdom
of
sennaar
and
bringing
with
him
three
of
the
chiefs
of
the
refractory
and
three
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
as
slaves
the
events
of
this
expedition
were
related
to
me
as
follows
we
marched
without
resistance
for
eight
days
in
the
direction
of
the
rising
sun
through
a
country
fine
fertile
and
crowded
with
villages
till
we
came
to
some
larger
villages
near
a
mountain
called
where
we
found
four
or
five
hundred
men
posted
in
front
of
them
to
resist
our
march
they
were
armed
with
lances
and
presented
themselves
to
the
combat
with
great
resolution
but
on
experiencing
the
effects
of
our
they
took
to
flight
toward
the
mountain
two
hundred
of
them
were
hemmed
in
and
cut
to
pieces
and
three
of
their
chiefs
were
taken
prisoners
as
well
as
all
the
inhabitants
we
could
find
in
their
villages
after
which
we
returned
on
my
demanding
if
water
was
plentiful
at
a
distance
from
the
river
my
informant
replied
that
there
were
wells
in
abundance
in
all
the
numerous
villages
with
which
the
country
abounds
and
also
numerous
rivulets
and
streams
which
at
this
season
descend
from
the
mountains
the
troops
he
said
had
forded
two
small
rivers
probably
the
ratt
and
the
dandar
he
added
that
the
country
abounded
in
beautiful
birds
and
insects
one
of
the
latter
he
brought
with
him
it
was
a
small
scarabeus
covered
with
a
fine
close
crimson
down
exactly
resembling
scarlet
velvet
the
people
of
the
country
he
described
as
very
harmless
and
exceedingly
anxious
to
know
what
had
brought
us
to
sennaar
to
trouble
them
two
of
these
chiefs
taken
prisoners
the
pasha
ordered
to
be
impaled
in
the
of
sennaar
they
suffered
this
horrid
death
with
great
firmness
one
of
them
said
nothing
but
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
his
apostle
which
he
frequently
repeated
before
impalement
while
the
other
named
abdallah
insulted
defied
and
cursed
his
executioners
calling
them
robbers
and
murderers
till
too
weak
to
speak
when
he
expressed
his
feelings
by
spitting
at
them
the
third
chief
was
detained
prisoner
in
order
to
be
sent
to
cairo
during
my
stay
in
sennaar
i
endeavored
to
get
information
of
the
people
of
the
country
and
of
the
few
caravan
merchants
found
in
the
of
sennaar
relative
to
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
the
nile
the
information
i
received
was
as
follows
the
source
of
the
adit
so
the
people
of
sennaar
call
the
river
that
runs
by
their
city
is
in
the
gibel
el
gumara
that
great
range
of
mountains
called
the
mountains
of
the
moon
about
sixty
days
march
of
a
camel
from
sennaar
in
a
direction
nearly
south
it
receives
at
various
distances
above
sennaar
several
smaller
rivers
which
come
from
abyssinia
and
from
the
mountains
south
of
sennaar
the
general
course
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
they
said
was
nearly
parallel
with
that
of
the
adit
but
its
source
was
much
farther
off
among
the
gibel
el
gumara
than
that
of
the
adit
the
bahar
el
abiud
they
said
appears
very
large
at
the
place
where
the
pasha
army
crossed
it
because
it
is
augmented
from
the
junction
of
three
other
rivers
one
from
the
and
two
others
from
the
east
running
from
the
mountains
south
of
sennaar
on
my
asking
them
whether
the
bahar
el
abiud
was
open
and
free
of
shellals
or
rapids
they
said
that
at
a
place
called
sulluk
about
fifteen
days
march
above
its
junction
with
the
adit
above
the
place
where
we
crossed
the
bahar
el
abiud
there
was
a
shellal
which
they
believed
that
boats
could
not
pass
on
my
asking
whether
by
following
the
banks
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
the
river
that
empties
into
it
from
the
west
it
was
not
possible
to
reach
a
city
called
tombut
or
tombuctoo
they
said
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
city
i
mentioned
having
never
been
farther
west
than
kordofan
and
darfour
this
was
all
i
could
learn
but
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
the
main
stream
of
the
bahar
el
abiud
can
not
have
its
source
in
the
same
latitude
with
that
of
the
adit
because
it
commenced
its
rise
at
least
this
year
about
twenty
days
sooner
than
did
the
adit
and
the
different
color
of
its
waters
proves
that
it
flows
through
a
tract
differing
in
quality
of
soil
from
that
through
which
passes
the
adit
the
interesting
question
whether
the
niger
communicates
with
the
bahar
el
abiud
will
however
very
probably
be
determined
before
the
close
of
another
year
as
the
pasha
will
probably
send
an
expedition
up
that
river
secondly
i
am
further
disposed
to
believe
that
the
main
stream
of
the
adit
or
nile
of
bruce
does
not
take
its
rise
in
abyssinia
but
in
the
mountains
assigned
as
the
place
of
its
origin
by
the
people
of
sennaar
for
on
viewing
the
mass
of
water
that
runs
by
sennaar
even
now
when
the
river
has
not
attained
of
the
usual
magnitude
it
acquires
during
the
rainy
season
i
can
by
no
means
believe
that
the
main
source
of
such
a
river
is
only
about
three
hundred
miles
distant
from
sennaar
the
tract
of
country
included
between
the
adit
and
the
bahar
el
abiud
is
called
el
gezira
the
island
because
in
the
season
of
the
rains
many
rivers
running
from
the
mountains
in
the
south
into
the
bahar
el
abiud
and
the
adit
occasion
this
tract
to
be
included
by
rivers
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
the
representations
made
of
the
climate
of
this
country
are
much
exaggerated
as
except
during
the
rainy
season
and
immediately
after
it
the
country
is
a
high
and
dry
plain
by
no
means
excessively
hot
because
the
level
of
the
countries
on
the
nile
being
constantly
ascending
from
egypt
occasions
sennaar
to
be
many
hundred
feet
higher
than
the
level
of
egypt
which
is
proved
by
the
rapid
descent
of
the
waters
of
the
nile
toward
the
latter
country
the
east
and
south
winds
also
are
in
sennaar
cool
breezes
because
they
come
either
from
the
mountains
of
abyssinia
or
the
huge
and
high
ranges
which
compose
the
gibel
el
gumara
i
was
in
sennaar
at
midsummer
and
at
no
time
found
the
heat
very
uncomfortable
provided
i
was
in
the
open
air
and
under
a
shade
in
the
cottages
and
houses
indeed
on
account
of
their
want
of
ventilation
the
heat
was
excessive
i
made
during
my
stay
in
sennaar
frequent
inquiries
about
the
fly
mentioned
by
bruce
the
people
of
sennaar
said
they
knew
nothing
of
it
but
in
reply
to
my
inquiries
referred
to
a
worm
which
they
say
comes
out
of
the
earth
during
the
rainy
season
and
whose
bite
is
dangerous
the
reptile
species
in
sennaar
are
numerous
the
houses
are
full
of
lizards
which
if
you
lie
on
the
floor
you
may
feel
crawling
or
running
over
you
all
night
i
saw
at
sennaar
a
serpent
of
a
species
i
believe
never
before
mentioned
it
was
a
snake
of
about
two
feet
long
and
not
thicker
than
my
thumb
striped
on
the
back
with
a
copper
colored
belly
and
a
flat
head
this
serpent
had
four
legs
which
did
not
appear
to
be
of
any
use
to
him
as
they
were
short
and
hanging
from
the
sides
of
his
belly
all
his
motions
which
were
quick
and
rapid
were
made
in
the
usual
manner
of
serpents
upon
its
belly
i
do
not
feel
authorized
to
give
an
opinion
as
to
the
national
character
of
the
people
inhabiting
the
kingdom
of
sennaar
but
i
am
obliged
to
consider
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
as
a
very
detestable
people
they
are
exceedingly
avaricious
extortionate
faithless
filthy
and
cruel
the
men
are
generally
tall
and
well
shaped
but
the
females
are
almost
universally
the
ugliest
i
ever
beheld
this
is
probably
owing
to
their
being
obliged
to
do
all
sorts
of
drudgery
the
children
of
these
people
and
indeed
of
all
the
tribes
on
the
upper
nile
go
quite
naked
till
near
the
age
of
puberty
a
girl
unmarried
is
distinguished
by
a
sort
of
short
leather
apron
composed
of
a
great
number
of
leather
thongs
hanging
like
tassels
from
a
leather
belt
fastened
round
the
waist
and
this
is
all
her
clothing
being
no
longer
than
that
of
our
mother
eve
after
her
fall
the
married
women
however
are
generally
habited
in
long
coarse
cotton
clothes
which
they
wrap
round
them
so
as
to
cover
their
whole
person
except
when
they
are
at
work
when
they
wrap
the
whole
round
the
waist
as
to
the
manufactures
of
the
people
of
the
upper
nile
they
are
limited
i
believe
to
the
following
articles
earthenware
for
domestic
uses
and
bowls
for
pipes
cotton
cloths
for
clothing
knives
mattocks
hoes
and
ploughs
for
agriculture
for
the
same
horse
furniture
such
as
the
best
formed
saddles
i
ever
rode
on
very
neatly
fabricated
stirrups
in
the
european
form
made
of
silver
for
the
chiefs
and
not
like
those
of
the
turks
large
iron
spurs
bits
with
small
chains
for
reins
to
prevent
them
from
being
severed
by
the
stroke
of
an
enemy
broadsword
long
and
double
edged
broadswords
with
the
guard
frequently
made
of
silver
iron
heads
for
lances
and
shields
made
of
the
hide
of
the
elephant
to
which
may
be
added
that
the
women
fabricate
very
beautiful
straw
mats
there
is
a
general
resemblance
in
domestic
customs
among
all
the
peoples
who
inhabit
the
borders
of
the
nile
from
assuan
to
sennaar
they
differ
however
somewhat
in
complexion
and
character
the
people
of
the
province
of
succoot
are
generally
not
so
black
as
the
nubian
or
the
dongolese
they
are
also
frank
and
prepossessing
in
their
deportment
the
dongolese
is
dirty
idle
and
ferocious
the
character
of
the
shageian
is
the
same
except
that
he
is
not
idle
being
either
an
industrious
peasant
or
a
daring
freebooter
the
people
on
the
third
cataract
are
not
very
industrious
but
have
the
character
of
being
honest
and
obliging
the
people
of
berber
are
by
far
the
most
civilized
of
all
the
people
of
the
upper
nile
the
inhabitants
of
the
provinces
of
shendi
and
halfya
are
a
sullen
scowling
crafty
and
ferocious
people
while
the
peasants
of
sennaar
inhabiting
the
villages
we
found
on
our
route
are
a
respectable
people
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
capital
throughout
the
whole
of
these
countries
there
is
one
general
characteristic
in
which
they
resemble
the
indians
of
america
namely
courage
and
the
chiefs
after
coming
to
salute
the
pasha
would
make
no
scruple
of
sitting
down
facing
him
and
converse
with
him
without
embarrassment
in
the
same
manner
as
they
are
accustomed
to
do
with
their
own
maleks
with
whom
they
are
very
familiar
with
the
greatest
apparent
simplicity
they
would
frequently
propose
troublesome
questions
to
the
pasha
such
as
o
great
sheck
or
o
great
malek
for
so
they
called
the
pasha
what
have
we
done
to
you
or
your
country
that
you
should
come
so
far
to
make
war
upon
us
is
it
for
want
of
food
in
your
country
that
you
come
to
get
it
in
ours
and
others
similar
on
the
of
the
moon
shawal
cogia
achmet
returned
to
sennaar
bringing
with
him
about
two
thousand
prisoners
as
slaves
consisting
almost
entirely
of
women
and
children
the
events
of
his
expedition
were
related
to
me
as
follows
he
marched
rapidly
for
ten
days
in
a
direction
about
of
sennaar
the
capital
without
resistance
through
a
country
without
meeting
with
any
opposition
till
he
came
to
the
mountains
of
bokki
inhabited
by
pagans
the
followers
of
the
chief
who
had
rejected
the
pasha
letter
they
were
posted
on
a
mountain
of
difficult
access
but
their
post
was
stormed
and
after
a
desperate
struggle
they
found
that
spears
and
swords
though
wielded
by
stout
hearts
and
able
hands
were
not
a
match
for
they
fled
to
another
mountain
rearward
of
their
first
position
they
were
again
attacked
by
cannon
and
musketry
and
obliged
to
fly
toward
a
third
position
in
their
flight
they
were
in
part
hemmed
in
by
the
cavalry
of
cogia
achmet
and
about
fifteen
hundred
of
them
put
to
the
sword
those
who
escaped
took
refuge
in
a
craggy
mountain
inaccessible
to
cavalry
cogia
achmet
believing
he
had
made
a
sufficient
proof
to
them
that
resistance
on
their
part
was
unavailing
and
the
troops
having
suffered
great
distress
by
reason
of
the
almost
continual
rains
after
sweeping
the
villages
of
these
people
of
all
the
population
they
could
find
in
them
resumed
his
march
for
sennaar
on
their
return
they
had
to
ford
several
deep
streams
at
this
season
running
from
the
mountains
and
both
horse
and
man
were
almost
worn
out
before
they
reached
sennaar
the
people
of
bokki
are
a
hardy
race
of
mountaineers
tall
stout
and
handsome
they
are
pagans
worshippers
of
the
sun
which
planet
they
consider
it
as
profane
to
look
at
the
prisoners
brought
in
by
cogia
achmet
resembled
in
their
dress
the
savages
of
america
they
were
almost
covered
with
beads
bracelets
and
trinkets
made
out
of
pebbles
bones
and
ivory
their
complexion
is
almost
black
and
their
manners
and
deportment
prepossessing
the
arms
of
these
people
gave
me
great
surprise
they
consisted
of
and
handsome
helmets
of
iron
coats
of
mail
made
of
leather
and
overlaid
with
plates
of
iron
long
and
well
fashioned
lances
and
a
exactly
resembling
the
ancient
bills
formerly
used
in
england
by
the
yeomanry
they
were
represented
to
me
by
the
turks
as
dangerous
in
personal
combat
they
had
never
seen
before
and
they
nevertheless
withstood
them
with
great
intrepidity
they
said
i
was
informed
that
a
fusee
was
a
coward
weapon
who
stands
at
a
safe
distance
from
his
enemy
and
kills
him
by
an
invisible
stroke
on
the
the
courier
carrying
the
information
to
cairo
of
this
expedition
and
its
results
embarked
in
a
canja
to
descend
the
river
as
far
as
berber
from
whence
he
would
proceed
by
the
desert
to
egypt
agreeably
to
the
promise
of
the
pasha
i
accompanied
him
we
arrived
at
nousreddin
in
berber
in
five
days
and
nights
having
the
favor
of
the
current
and
sixteen
oarsmen
on
board
we
descended
with
great
rapidity
the
view
of
the
country
from
the
river
is
not
pleasing
as
the
villages
lie
almost
invariably
far
off
from
the
river
the
country
therefore
has
the
appearance
of
being
almost
uninhabited
we
saw
great
numbers
of
hippopotami
who
in
the
night
would
lift
their
heads
out
of
the
water
at
no
great
distance
from
the
canja
they
were
sometimes
fired
at
but
without
apparent
effect
we
stopped
during
the
night
for
an
hour
at
shendi
to
leave
orders
from
the
pasha
to
a
small
garrison
of
turkish
troops
stationed
there
the
river
nile
below
the
point
of
junction
with
the
great
bahar
el
abiud
presents
a
truly
magnificent
spectacle
between
halfya
and
shendi
the
river
is
straitened
and
traverses
a
deep
and
gloomy
defile
formed
by
high
rocky
hills
between
which
the
nile
runs
dark
deep
and
rapidly
for
about
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
on
emerging
from
this
defile
the
river
again
spreads
itself
majestically
and
flows
between
immense
plains
of
herbage
bounded
only
by
the
horizon
its
banks
nearly
full
but
not
yet
overflowed
about
thirty
miles
above
nousreddin
we
passed
the
mouth
of
the
bahar
el
iswood
on
the
eastern
shore
it
is
the
last
river
that
empties
into
the
nile
i
estimated
it
at
about
of
a
mile
broad
at
its
embouchure
the
nile
below
the
point
of
junction
with
this
river
is
more
than
two
miles
from
bank
to
bank
at
this
season
during
the
two
first
days
of
our
voyage
we
had
some
severe
squalls
and
very
heavy
rains
but
after
passing
the
territory
of
sennaar
we
had
a
sky
almost
without
a
cloud
on
our
arrival
at
nousreddin
no
more
dromedaries
could
be
immediately
obtained
than
were
sufficient
to
mount
the
courier
and
his
two
guides
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
tarry
five
days
in
nousreddin
before
i
could
find
a
caravan
journeying
to
egypt
on
the
of
shawal
i
quitted
nousreddin
along
with
a
caravan
on
its
way
to
egypt
from
sennaar
conducted
by
a
soldier
attached
to
the
cadilaskier
of
the
army
of
ismael
pasha
who
was
conducting
to
egypt
dromedaries
and
camels
and
some
slaves
belonging
to
the
cadilaskier
and
four
fine
horses
belonging
to
the
pasha
we
started
at
about
three
hours
before
noon
and
after
marching
for
three
hours
stopped
at
a
village
named
sheraffey
to
obtain
rations
for
the
horses
and
camels
to
subsist
them
through
the
desert
our
route
lay
on
the
outside
of
the
villages
and
on
the
border
of
the
desert
the
villages
are
numerous
and
well
built
of
bricks
and
the
face
of
the
country
on
our
side
of
the
river
perfectly
level
we
stayed
at
sheraffey
until
the
next
morning
the
conductor
of
the
caravan
not
being
able
to
obtain
at
this
place
the
durra
he
wanted
for
his
cattle
we
proceeded
to
a
village
called
hassah
which
is
about
an
hour
march
from
sheraffey
we
stayed
there
till
next
morning
on
the
of
the
moon
at
we
mounted
our
camels
and
proceeded
on
our
road
which
lay
on
the
skirts
of
the
desert
we
passed
a
continual
succession
of
large
and
populous
villages
lying
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
river
the
weather
serene
and
cool
as
it
has
been
since
our
arrival
in
berber
we
halted
at
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
by
a
village
called
abdea
until
an
hour
and
a
half
before
sunset
when
we
again
set
forward
and
after
marching
for
three
hours
and
a
half
halted
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
a
small
village
half
in
ruins
the
reason
of
our
short
marches
and
frequent
stoppages
was
to
give
the
conductor
of
the
caravan
opportunities
to
make
provision
for
passing
the
desert
he
might
have
done
it
at
any
of
the
villages
had
he
been
content
to
pay
the
price
demanded
but
as
he
was
a
man
who
seemed
to
hold
hard
bargains
in
horror
and
to
love
money
with
great
affection
he
did
not
give
the
latter
for
durra
till
he
was
absolutely
obliged
to
make
the
afflictive
exchange
on
the
of
zilkade
we
started
at
daylight
and
marched
till
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
when
we
stopped
at
some
villages
called
gannettee
the
country
we
passed
since
yesterday
is
the
desert
which
comes
down
close
to
the
river
bank
presenting
but
few
spots
fit
for
cultivation
we
were
informed
last
night
that
the
camp
of
mehemmet
bey
who
is
on
his
way
from
egypt
with
five
thousand
men
to
take
possession
of
darfour
and
kordofan
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
weather
continues
serene
and
not
very
hot
stayed
at
gannettee
till
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
through
a
a
desert
and
dreary
country
without
either
habitations
or
cultivation
as
the
desert
comes
here
down
to
the
river
the
rocks
and
stones
of
the
desert
are
generally
of
black
granite
no
verdure
was
to
be
seen
except
on
the
margin
of
the
river
the
river
hereabouts
is
much
impeded
by
rocks
and
rapids
but
contains
many
beautiful
islands
some
of
them
very
large
fertile
populous
and
well
cultivated
malek
mohammed
el
hadgin
commands
this
country
his
province
called
el
raba
tab
contains
large
and
fertile
islands
and
the
shores
of
the
river
adjacent
he
has
a
very
high
character
for
courage
morals
and
generosity
he
resides
on
the
great
island
of
mograt
which
is
said
to
be
about
sixty
miles
long
we
halted
at
about
three
hours
before
midnight
on
the
bank
of
the
river
within
hearing
of
a
shellal
where
the
river
forms
a
regular
cataract
except
a
small
pass
on
the
easterly
shore
after
reposing
the
camels
an
hour
and
a
half
and
refreshing
ourselves
with
bread
and
the
muddy
water
of
the
nile
we
recommenced
our
march
which
was
continued
without
cessation
till
an
hour
before
noon
next
morning
always
through
the
desert
in
order
to
cut
a
point
of
land
formed
by
an
angle
in
the
river
when
we
stopped
under
the
shade
of
some
fine
date
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
in
view
of
one
of
its
large
and
ever
verdant
isles
called
kandessee
in
a
small
island
adjoining
which
khalil
aga
my
companion
says
he
saw
when
he
ascended
the
third
cataract
a
pyramid
more
modern
and
fresh
than
any
he
had
seen
in
these
countries
possibly
the
island
of
kandessee
takes
its
name
from
the
celebrated
candace
who
in
the
reign
of
nero
repulsed
and
defeated
the
roman
legions
and
this
pyramid
may
be
her
tomb
under
the
date
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
river
opposite
to
this
island
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
our
usual
repast
bread
and
water
as
the
people
of
a
village
close
by
would
give
us
meat
neither
for
love
money
nor
soap
of
which
latter
article
they
stand
in
great
but
unconscious
need
of
zilkade
quitted
our
station
about
two
hours
after
midnight
and
went
on
our
way
our
route
continued
to
lie
through
the
desert
but
not
far
from
the
bank
of
the
river
about
three
hours
before
noon
in
the
morning
came
to
a
small
village
named
haphasheem
lying
on
the
margin
of
the
river
opposite
a
verdant
island
it
was
delightful
to
look
at
the
river
on
the
third
cataract
khalil
aga
tells
me
contains
a
continual
chain
of
such
i
could
not
get
any
thing
to
relish
our
usual
repast
of
bread
and
water
except
some
dates
my
eyes
were
much
inflamed
by
the
reflection
of
the
sun
rays
from
the
sand
and
at
night
were
very
painful
and
running
with
matter
stayed
here
till
about
the
same
hour
after
midnight
as
yesterday
when
we
again
set
forward
the
country
the
same
as
yesterday
except
that
we
saw
several
stony
mountains
in
the
desert
some
of
them
at
no
great
distance
from
the
river
some
of
these
mountains
must
contain
ruins
as
at
the
village
where
we
halted
which
we
did
at
about
noon
we
found
a
very
large
and
burnt
brick
which
the
peasants
said
was
brought
from
one
of
these
mountains
the
whole
of
the
country
through
which
we
have
passed
for
four
days
contains
no
cultivable
land
on
this
side
of
the
river
except
on
its
margin
but
in
compensation
for
this
sterility
the
islands
in
this
part
of
the
river
which
are
numerous
very
large
and
very
beautiful
are
without
a
superior
for
luxuriance
of
vegetation
every
day
when
we
have
come
to
the
river
to
halt
and
refresh
ourselves
we
found
one
or
more
in
view
at
this
last
station
i
was
lucky
enough
to
purchase
a
small
kid
at
the
enormous
price
of
twelve
piasters
the
first
meat
we
had
eaten
for
four
days
applied
at
night
a
poultice
of
dates
to
my
eyes
which
were
much
inflamed
by
today
march
and
found
some
relief
from
the
remedy
at
about
three
hours
after
midnight
we
again
resumed
our
travel
and
marched
till
an
hour
before
noon
of
the
of
zilkade
expecting
to
arrive
at
the
place
where
the
road
quits
the
river
and
plunges
into
the
great
eastern
desert
of
africa
but
the
weather
becoming
close
and
very
hot
and
the
camels
fatigued
we
halted
to
repose
them
and
ourselves
on
the
bank
of
the
river
shortly
after
our
arrival
two
of
the
camels
of
the
caravan
died
our
route
still
lay
through
plains
and
over
hills
of
rock
and
sand
which
come
down
to
the
river
edge
but
the
river
as
usual
presented
a
continual
succession
of
beautiful
islands
the
death
of
the
two
camels
having
alarmed
the
conductor
of
the
caravan
for
the
others
we
stayed
in
this
place
till
the
middle
of
the
second
day
after
to
repose
and
refresh
them
previous
to
entering
the
desert
during
our
stay
here
i
engaged
a
man
to
swim
over
to
the
island
opposite
to
purchase
some
durra
flour
and
dates
he
could
however
obtain
only
some
dates
i
was
obliged
in
consequence
to
reconcile
myself
to
entering
the
desert
short
of
provisions
i
had
made
provision
in
berber
for
fifteen
days
being
assured
that
in
twelve
days
we
should
have
passed
the
desert
and
arrive
at
the
villages
on
the
bank
of
the
nile
four
days
march
above
assuan
the
unexpected
retardments
of
our
march
from
berber
had
however
made
us
nine
days
in
arriving
at
the
place
where
the
road
turns
into
the
desert
on
the
of
the
moon
at
about
two
hours
before
sunset
we
quitted
our
and
after
only
one
hour
march
by
the
border
of
the
river
came
to
a
place
where
the
nile
suddenly
turns
off
toward
the
at
this
place
the
guide
told
us
we
were
to
fill
our
waterskins
and
to
quit
the
river
for
the
desert
we
stayed
here
till
the
afternoon
of
the
of
the
moon
the
two
last
nights
we
have
kept
watch
and
only
slept
with
our
hands
upon
our
arms
robbers
being
we
were
told
in
this
neighborhood
who
had
lately
pillaged
some
caravans
we
were
not
however
molested
the
desert
on
the
border
of
the
river
hereabouts
abounds
with
doum
trees
which
are
inhabited
by
great
numbers
of
monkeys
its
fruit
furnishes
their
food
this
fruit
consists
in
a
large
nut
on
the
outside
covered
with
a
brown
substance
almost
exactly
resembling
burned
gingerbread
it
is
however
so
hard
that
no
other
teeth
and
jaws
except
those
of
a
monkey
or
an
arab
are
well
capable
of
biting
it
about
one
hour
march
below
our
present
position
is
an
encampment
of
bedouins
and
the
tomb
of
a
marabout
the
people
of
the
country
and
the
caravans
had
piled
his
grave
with
camels
and
asses
saddles
probably
intended
as
offerings
to
interest
his
good
offices
in
the
other
world
at
about
four
hours
after
the
noon
of
the
we
quitted
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
turned
into
the
desert
carrying
as
much
water
as
we
well
could
myself
taking
four
for
myself
khalil
aga
and
a
black
slave
of
mine
we
marched
till
about
an
hour
before
midnight
when
we
halted
for
an
hour
to
breathe
the
camels
and
to
eat
a
morsel
of
bread
after
which
we
continued
our
way
till
nearly
when
one
of
the
pasha
horses
falling
down
and
refusing
to
rise
it
was
necessary
to
wait
till
the
animal
had
taken
a
little
rest
we
threw
ourselves
upon
the
sand
and
slept
profoundly
for
two
hours
when
we
were
roused
to
continue
our
journey
we
proceeded
till
about
two
hours
before
noon
when
we
halted
in
a
low
sandy
plain
sprinkled
here
and
there
with
thorny
bushes
these
bushes
afforded
food
for
the
camels
and
a
miserable
shelter
from
the
sun
for
ourselves
we
shoved
embodies
under
them
as
closely
to
their
roots
as
the
thorns
would
admit
to
sleep
as
well
sheltered
as
possible
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
vertical
sun
but
sound
sleep
in
this
condition
was
impossible
as
every
the
sun
advancing
in
his
course
contracted
or
changed
the
shadow
of
the
bush
and
obliged
us
to
change
our
position
as
to
sleep
in
his
rays
in
this
climate
is
not
only
almost
impossible
but
dangerous
it
almost
infallibly
producing
a
fever
of
the
brain
the
country
we
traversed
this
first
day
journey
is
a
level
plain
of
sand
and
gravel
with
scattered
mountains
of
black
granite
here
and
there
in
view
where
no
sound
is
heard
but
the
rush
of
the
wind
the
weather
was
cool
enough
during
the
day
and
coldish
in
the
night
in
the
afternoon
we
again
set
forward
proceeding
and
halting
as
yesterday
viz
once
for
an
hour
about
two
hours
before
midnight
and
once
again
a
little
before
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
desert
continued
to
exhibit
the
same
aspect
as
before
till
about
midnight
when
we
quitted
the
plains
to
enter
among
gloomy
defiles
winding
between
mountains
of
black
granite
we
passed
one
chain
and
at
a
little
beyond
the
entrance
of
another
lying
about
two
leagues
to
the
north
of
the
first
the
guide
told
us
that
we
were
near
the
well
apseach
soon
after
we
arrived
at
a
place
containing
bushes
here
the
caravan
halted
and
those
who
wanted
fresh
water
filled
their
from
the
well
which
lies
in
the
mountains
about
an
hour
march
from
the
place
where
we
halted
this
well
is
at
the
bottom
of
an
oblique
passage
leading
into
one
of
the
mountains
at
the
termination
of
which
is
found
no
great
quantity
of
sweet
water
deposited
by
the
rains
which
fall
in
this
country
about
the
time
of
the
summer
solstice
during
the
last
two
days
i
traveled
in
great
pain
the
reflection
of
the
sun
from
the
sand
and
the
strong
wind
from
the
north
prevalent
at
this
season
in
the
desert
which
blew
its
finer
particles
into
my
eyes
in
spite
of
all
my
precautions
to
shelter
them
exasperated
and
inflamed
their
malady
to
a
great
degree
which
the
want
of
sufficient
shelter
from
the
sun
during
the
time
of
repose
contributed
to
aggravate
we
stayed
near
the
well
till
about
sunset
when
we
resumed
our
travel
and
at
about
three
hours
after
sunrise
on
the
morning
of
the
came
to
a
rock
in
a
sandy
plain
where
the
conductor
of
the
caravan
ordered
a
halt
we
distributed
ourselves
round
this
rock
as
well
as
we
could
in
order
to
repose
khalil
aga
and
myself
making
a
covering
from
the
sun
by
means
of
my
carpet
propped
up
by
our
fusees
and
fastened
by
the
corners
to
stones
we
placed
upon
the
rock
by
means
of
our
shawls
and
sashes
we
stayed
here
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
we
mounted
our
camels
in
order
to
reach
the
well
morat
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
water
those
patient
and
indispensable
voyagers
of
the
desert
we
traversed
a
tolerably
level
but
rocky
tract
till
about
two
hours
after
midnight
when
we
reached
the
well
it
lies
in
a
valley
between
two
high
chains
of
mountains
of
black
granite
its
water
is
somewhat
bitter
as
its
name
imports
and
is
not
drank
by
travelers
except
when
their
are
exhausted
it
serves
however
for
the
camels
of
the
caravans
and
for
the
inhabitants
of
two
arab
villages
in
the
vicinity
named
abu
hammak
and
dohap
who
brought
their
camels
to
water
here
the
morning
after
our
arrival
these
poor
but
contented
people
are
obliged
to
subsist
for
the
most
part
upon
their
milk
their
situation
affording
little
other
means
of
nourishment
they
are
however
independent
and
remote
from
the
tyranny
and
oppression
which
afflicts
the
people
of
most
of
the
countries
of
the
east
on
the
rocks
near
the
well
we
saw
some
rude
hieroglyphics
representing
bulls
horses
and
camels
cut
in
the
granite
in
the
manner
of
those
found
in
the
rocks
near
assuan
on
the
south
side
of
the
cataract
our
guide
tells
us
that
such
cuttings
in
the
rocks
are
found
in
many
of
the
mountains
of
the
desert
during
our
stay
at
morat
a
violent
dispute
had
arisen
among
the
arabs
of
our
caravan
about
some
money
which
had
been
stolen
from
one
of
them
the
man
suspected
of
the
theft
endeavored
to
justify
himself
by
much
hard
swearing
but
circumstances
being
strong
against
him
i
told
the
man
who
had
been
robbed
that
if
the
money
was
not
restored
previous
to
our
arrival
at
assuan
i
would
speak
to
the
cacheff
about
the
affair
who
would
take
the
proper
measures
to
detect
and
punish
the
thief
in
consequence
of
this
menace
the
man
robbed
next
morning
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
unexpectedly
that
his
money
had
been
secretly
restored
and
deposited
among
the
baggage
from
whence
it
had
been
stolen
on
the
at
sunset
we
quitted
morat
and
after
a
winding
march
among
the
hills
for
five
hours
we
arrived
at
a
broad
valley
surrounded
by
high
mountains
and
abounding
in
doum
trees
the
first
we
had
seen
since
we
quitted
the
river
this
place
is
called
el
medina
it
contains
an
arab
village
whose
inhabitants
gain
something
by
supplying
the
caravans
with
goats
of
which
they
have
many
and
by
furnishing
them
with
water
of
which
they
possess
several
reservoirs
filled
by
the
rains
we
reposed
for
the
rest
of
the
night
under
the
doum
trees
and
in
the
morning
regaled
ourselves
with
the
pure
and
wholesome
water
of
el
medina
which
was
to
me
particularly
grateful
after
being
obliged
to
drink
for
several
days
either
the
muddy
water
we
had
brought
from
the
river
or
that
of
apseach
which
had
become
heated
by
the
sun
and
impregnated
with
a
disgusting
smell
derived
from
the
new
leather
of
the
which
contained
it
i
bought
here
a
fat
goat
and
some
milk
which
made
us
a
feast
which
hunger
and
several
days
fasting
on
bad
bread
made
delicious
we
stayed
here
to
water
and
repose
the
camels
till
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
when
we
recommenced
our
march
for
the
river
whose
distance
we
were
told
was
three
days
march
from
el
medina
during
our
stay
at
el
medina
khalil
aga
my
companion
was
taken
very
ill
with
vomiting
and
purging
occasioned
by
having
drank
of
the
water
of
morat
against
which
i
had
remonstrated
without
effect
he
did
not
get
quit
of
the
consequences
of
his
imprudence
for
several
days
on
the
in
the
afternoon
we
commenced
our
march
for
the
river
the
desert
hereabouts
resembles
that
we
passed
the
two
first
days
after
our
quitting
the
river
being
a
sandy
plain
studded
with
hills
and
mountains
of
granite
we
proceeded
till
about
three
hours
after
midnight
when
we
lay
down
to
repose
till
when
we
again
mounted
and
continued
our
journey
till
two
hours
before
noon
when
we
stopped
at
a
rock
which
had
some
holes
in
it
where
we
sheltered
ourselves
from
the
sun
and
dined
with
appetite
on
some
coarse
durra
bread
baked
upon
camel
dung
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
were
again
on
our
way
which
led
through
the
deep
and
winding
valleys
of
three
mountains
of
calcareous
stone
which
indicated
the
proximity
of
the
river
and
over
hills
of
deep
sand
with
which
the
eddies
of
the
wind
had
in
many
places
filled
those
valleys
since
we
left
morat
till
we
came
to
these
mountains
the
granite
hills
had
become
rarer
others
of
calcareous
stone
here
and
there
presented
themselves
and
the
level
of
the
desert
was
constantly
ascending
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
level
of
the
interior
of
the
desert
is
lower
than
the
bed
of
the
river
during
the
passage
over
these
hills
several
of
the
camels
gave
out
that
of
my
black
slave
among
the
rest
four
hours
after
sunrise
we
came
to
a
valley
where
there
was
here
and
there
some
herbs
of
the
desert
where
we
stopped
to
let
the
camels
eat
they
having
fasted
since
we
left
el
medina
we
were
obliged
to
look
among
the
rocks
for
shelter
from
the
sun
each
one
arranging
himself
as
well
as
he
could
to
eat
durra
bread
and
drink
warm
water
and
sleep
as
soundly
as
possible
during
the
course
of
last
night
we
fell
in
with
a
caravan
coming
from
assuan
we
pressed
round
them
to
buy
something
to
eat
we
asked
for
dates
and
flour
to
make
bread
but
they
had
nothing
of
the
kind
that
they
could
afford
to
part
with
we
stayed
at
the
rock
before
mentioned
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
on
awaking
from
sleep
i
observed
two
of
the
arabs
of
our
caravan
busily
employed
about
our
guide
they
were
a
long
time
engaged
in
frizzing
and
plaiting
his
hair
and
finished
the
operation
by
pouring
over
it
a
bowlful
of
melted
mutton
suet
which
made
his
head
quite
white
i
asked
for
the
meaning
of
this
operation
at
this
time
they
told
me
that
we
should
be
at
the
river
morning
and
that
our
guide
was
adorning
himself
to
see
and
salute
his
friends
there
he
appeared
to
be
highly
satisfied
with
the
efforts
of
his
to
make
him
look
decent
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
made
a
very
buckish
appearance
as
soon
as
our
guide
had
finished
his
toilette
he
mounted
his
dromedary
and
took
his
post
in
front
and
we
set
forward
we
marched
all
night
without
stopping
which
was
necessary
as
our
water
was
nearly
spent
but
which
distressed
greatly
that
part
of
our
caravan
who
had
no
beast
to
ride
these
wretched
men
had
hitherto
accompanied
us
all
the
way
on
foot
with
little
to
eat
and
less
to
drink
at
present
they
were
almost
exhausted
with
fatigue
hunger
and
thirst
every
now
and
then
one
or
more
of
them
would
throw
himself
on
the
sand
in
despair
the
repeated
assurance
that
the
river
was
near
hour
after
hour
became
less
and
less
capable
of
rousing
them
to
exertion
and
the
whip
was
at
length
applied
to
make
them
get
up
and
go
on
they
demanded
water
immediately
which
we
were
too
short
of
ourselves
to
give
them
as
we
feared
every
minute
that
our
camels
would
drop
which
would
render
every
drop
of
water
we
had
as
precious
as
life
one
unfortunate
lad
who
had
joined
the
caravan
before
it
entered
the
desert
i
suspect
a
domestic
who
had
fled
from
the
distresses
that
had
found
us
in
the
upper
countries
made
pathetic
applications
to
me
for
water
i
twice
divided
with
him
a
bowlful
i
was
drinking
in
the
name
of
god
the
protector
of
the
traveler
this
young
man
in
the
course
of
this
toilsome
night
had
disappeared
having
doubtless
laid
himself
down
in
despair
we
unfortunately
did
not
miss
him
till
it
was
too
late
about
two
hours
before
we
reached
the
entrance
of
a
deep
ravine
between
ridges
and
hills
of
rocks
we
marched
in
it
for
six
hours
it
zigzagged
perpetually
and
its
bottom
was
covered
with
fragments
of
the
rocks
that
enclosed
it
and
which
had
apparently
been
displaced
by
strong
currents
of
water
this
phenomenon
surprised
me
as
the
entrance
into
this
ravine
being
from
the
plain
it
was
evident
that
the
currents
which
had
produced
these
displacements
could
not
at
any
era
have
come
from
thence
but
at
the
termination
of
this
ravine
which
ended
nearly
at
the
river
the
cause
became
evident
an
ancient
canal
now
nearly
filled
up
leads
from
the
river
into
this
ravine
and
the
rush
of
the
current
during
the
seasons
of
inundation
has
loosened
and
displaced
fragments
of
the
bordering
mountains
it
was
about
two
hours
before
noon
on
the
of
zilkade
when
emerging
from
this
ravine
we
came
upon
the
bank
of
the
beautiful
and
blessed
river
which
is
the
very
heart
and
life
blood
of
all
africa
it
was
with
the
most
grateful
feelings
toward
the
lord
of
the
universe
that
i
laid
myself
down
under
the
date
trees
by
its
brink
to
cool
and
to
wash
my
swollen
and
inflamed
eyes
whose
disorder
was
greatly
increased
by
fatigue
a
dazzling
sun
and
want
of
sleep
immediately
after
our
arrival
at
the
little
village
of
seboo
which
stands
on
the
canal
leading
to
the
ravine
before
mentioned
myself
and
khalil
aga
addressed
ourselves
to
the
people
of
the
village
to
engage
some
one
to
go
and
bring
to
the
river
the
unfortunate
lad
who
had
been
missed
i
told
them
that
in
two
hours
a
man
mounted
on
a
dromedary
could
reach
the
place
where
he
had
disappeared
and
save
his
life
i
appealed
to
their
humanity
to
their
sense
of
duty
towards
god
and
man
to
engage
them
to
go
and
save
him
finding
them
deaf
to
my
entreaties
i
offered
them
money
and
khalil
aga
his
musket
to
bring
him
safe
and
sound
to
the
river
i
appealed
to
their
humanity
in
vain
and
to
their
avarice
without
effect
we
told
them
that
the
christians
in
a
case
of
this
kind
would
send
not
one
but
forty
men
if
necessary
to
go
and
save
a
fellow
creature
from
the
horrible
death
of
desert
famine
and
that
heaven
would
surely
require
at
their
hands
the
life
of
this
young
man
if
they
neglected
to
save
him
at
length
the
sheck
of
the
village
promised
me
to
send
a
dromedary
to
the
place
morning
he
made
the
promise
probably
to
appease
my
reproaches
for
he
did
not
fulfill
it

having

hasty

excited
by

the
desperate
courage
of
these
wretched
peasants
was
astonishing

advanced
more
than
once

the
muzzles
of
the
cannon
and
wounded
some
of
the
cannoneers
in
the
act
of
their
guns
notwithstanding
their
efforts
such
was
the
disparity
of
their
arms
against
cannon

that
only
one
of
the
pasha
soldiers
was
killed
and
they
are
said
to
have
lost
seven
hundred
in
the
battle
and
during
the
pursuit
footnote
i
say
shot
down
for
the
saber
was
found
an
unavailing
weapon
as
these
people
are
so
adroit
in
the
management
of
their
shields
that
they
parried
every
stroke
i
have
seen
upon
the
field
where
this
battle
was
fought
several
shields

had
not
less
than
ten

fifteen
saber
cuts

carried
it

had
evidently
died

told

when

fled
in

she
dropped

well
wrought

was
taken
prisoner

clothed
her
magnificently

turkish
fashion

sent
her
to
her
father

her
to
tell
him

come

surrender

dragged
up
nine
boats

deputies
from
the
chiefs

arrived
in
the
camp
to
demand
of
the
pasha
for
what
reason
he
menaced
them
with
war
the
pasha
replied
because
you
are
robbers
who
live
by
disturbing
and
pillaging
all
the
countries
around
your
own
they
replied
that
they
had
no
other
means
to
live
the
pasha
answered
cultivate
your
land
and
live
honestly
they
replied
with
great
naivete
we
have
been
bred
up
to
live
and
prosper
by
what
you
call
robbery
we
will
not
work

can
not

is
a
singular
circumstance

title

used

petty
sovereigns

canaan
footnote
the
shageia
cavalry
however
wore
these
cloths
cut

made
into
long
shirts
in
order
probably
to
have
the
freer
management
of
their
lances
shields
and
broad
swords
it
should
also
be
stated
that
the
maleks

chiefs
of
the
upper
nile
were
generally
habited
in
fine
blue

white
shirts
brought
from

circumstance

dress
is
common
also
among
the
peasants

sexes
of
dongola

third
cataract
with
this
addition
that
they
not

anoint
the
head

butter

protects
them

the
day

was
very
hot

got
affected
by
a
coup

gave
me
a
violent
fever

i
have
strong
suspicions
that
this
circumstance
acted
as
a
powerful
preventer
stay

my
virtue

enabled
me
to
put
the
devil
to
flight

this
trying
occasion

appeared
to
be
edified

the
discourse

some
risk

falling

was
continually
prowling

two
nights

reached

i
stopped
on
the
route
at
a
village
to
take
some
refreshment
letting
the
army
go
by
me
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
i
mounted
my
horse
to
follow
the
troops
but
owing
to
the
state
of
my
eyes
i
missed
my
way
after
wandering
and
forwards
to
find
the
track
of
the
troops
about
two
hours
after
midnight
i
descried
the
rockets
always
thrown
aloft
during
our
night
marches
to
direct
all
stragglers
to
the
place
where
the
pasha
had
encamped
i
put
my
horse
to
his
speed
and
arrived
there
a
little
before
dawn

during
the
night
of
the
i
received
an
order
from

precede

march
of
the
troops

pick
out
a
spot
near
halfya
to
encamp
his
army

the
european
manner
caillaud
was
requested
to
accompany
me
in
this
duty
caillaud
candidly
told
me
that
he
was
not
a
military
man

left
the
affair
entirely
to
me
i
chose
a
fine
position
on
the
river
about
two
miles
above
halfya
in
the
rear
of
which
was
plenty
of
grass
for
the
horses
and
camels
the
pasha
however
did
not
choose
to
come
so
far
but
pitched
his
camp
on
the
low
sand
flats
before
halfya
near
which
there
was
no
grass
for
the
camels
who
during
the
five
days
following
perished
in
great
numbers
he
had
undoubtedly
his
reasons
for
this
among
which
not
the
least
important
was
to
be
near
enough
to
halfya
to
have
the
town
within
reach
of
his
cannon
as
the
malek
of
halfya
had
not
as
yet
submitted
the
pasha
however
had
like
to
have
had
serious
cause
to
repent
of
having
taken
this
position

i
must
confess
that
i
was
much
shocked
and
disgusted
by
this
act
on
the
part
of
the
pasha
especially
as
he
had
shown
so
many
traits
of
humanity
in

lower
country
which
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
its
prompt
submission
this
execution
was
excused
in
the
camp
by
saying
that
it
would
strike
such
terror
as
would
repress
all
attempts
at
insurrection
and
would
consequently
prevent
the
effusion
of
much
blood

may
have
been
consistent

the
principles

military
policy

feel
an
insurmountable
reluctance

believe
it

told

four
inches

was
told
that

i
have
seen
very
many

we
found
to
be
the
case

nile

out
of
the
camels
that
we
had
commenced
our
march
with
from
berber
only
twelve
reached
the
river
footnote
this
was
occasioned
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
dryness
of
the
air
of
the
desert
which
made
nearly
two
fifths
of

footnote
before
we
entered
the
desert
our
caravan
had
been
joined
by
several
runaway
domestics

had

return
to
egypt
footnote
the
soldier
of
the
cadilaskier
before
mentioned
who
was
the
conductor
the
chief
of
the
caravan
had
recourse
to
a
singular
expedient
to
rouse
one
of
them
whom
the
whip
could
not
stir
he
seized
his
purse
of
money
which
this
man
carried
in
his
bosom
swearing
that
if
he
chose
to
stop
and
die
there
he
might
and
that
he
would
be
his
heir
and
inherit
his
purse
this
testamentary
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
soldier
had
a
wonderful
effect
the
man
got
up
from
the
sand
and
walked
forward
very
briskly
calling
upon
the
soldier
to
restore
the
purse
as
he
was
determined
not
to
lie
down
any
more
till
he
reached
the
river
the
soldier
however
observing
the
effect
of
his
proceeding
retained
the
purse
till
we
arrived
at
the
river
when
he
restored
it
footnote
the
last
time
i
saw
him
was
when
i
gave
him
part
of
the
last
bowl
he
kissed
my
slipper
shedding
abundance
of
tears
and
saying
that
i
was
the
only
one
of
the
caravan
that
had
shown
him
mercy
i
bade
him
keep
up
a
good
heart
for
that
on
the
morrow
morning
by
the
blessing
of
god
we
should
be
at
the
river

bank
of

river
stands
an
ancient
egyptian
temple
seboo
is
four
days
march
of
a
camel
above
assuan
footnote
the
reason
for
their
refusal
i
afterwards
learned
was
that
they
believed
that
the
lad
was
already
dead
and
that
therefore
they
should
miss
the
reward
promised
footnote
three
days
after
my
arrival
at
assuan
i
had
news
of
the
fate
of
this
lad
from
a
nubian
voyager
of
the
desert
on
his
way
to
assuan
who
had
found
him
hours
after
our
arrival
at
seboo
lying
in
the
ravine
leading
to
the
river
but
almost
dead
he
had
stopped
it
seems
to
sleep
a
few
hours
believing
that
sleep
would
refresh
him
and
that
he
could
do
it
without
danger
as
the
river
was
not
many
hours
off
on
his
awaking
he
found
himself
so
weak
that
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
reached
the
ravine
where
he
fell
the
traveler
gave
him
water
and
placed
him
on
his
dromedary
and
brought
him
to
the
river
but
he
was
too
far
gone
he
died
in
a
half
an
hour
after
he
reached
it
the
last
words
he
spoke
this
man
told
me
related
to
his
god
his
prophet
and
his
mother
this
traveler
dug
his
grave
and
buried
him
i
told
this
man
that
i
had
offered
a
reward
at
seboo
to
whoever
would
bring
this
unfortunate
young
man
to
the
river
and
that
i
would
give
the
money
to
him
as
a
recompense
for
having
done
all
he
could
do
in
such
a
case
the
man
to
my
astonishment
replied
that
it
was
not
money
that
he
would
take
as
a
reward
for
what
he
had
done
that
he
would
receive
no
reward
for
it
but
from
the
hands
of
god
who
would
pay
more
for
it
than
i
could
i
told
him
that
i
was
happy
to
have
found
a
mussulman
mindful
of
the
precepts
of
the
koran
which
inculcate
charity
and
benevolence
to
all
those
who
are
in
distress
and
that
the
record
of
such
deeds
would
occupy
a
great
space
on
the
almost
blank
page
of
our
good
actions
