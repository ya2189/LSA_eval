sketches
of
the
east
africa
campaign
by
capt
robert
dolbey
author
of
a
regimental
surgeon
in
war
and
prison
with
illustrations
to
and
preface
the
bulk
of
these
sketches
were
written
without
any
thought
of
publication
it
was
my
practice
in
writing
home
to
touch
upon
different
features
of
the
campaign
or
of
my
daily
experiences
and
only
when
i
returned
to
england
to
find
that
kind
hands
had
carefully
preserved
these
hurried
letters
did
it
occur
to
me
that
grouped
together
they
might
serve
to
throw
some
light
on
certain
aspects
of
the
east
africa
campaign
which
might
not
find
a
place
in
a
more
elaborate
history
for
the
illustrations
i
have
been
able
to
draw
upon
a
number
of
german
photographs
which
fell
into
our
hands
i
should
like
to
take
this
opportunity
of
thanking
montague
bell
for
the
care
and
kindness
with
which
he
has
grouped
this
collection
of
sketches
and
formed
it
into
a
more
or
less
comprehensive

introduction
these
sketches
of
general
smuts
campaign
of
in
german
east
africa
do
not
presume
to
give
an
accurate
account
of
the
tactical
or
strategical
events
of
this
war
the
actual
knowledge
of
the
happenings
of
war
and
of
the
considerations
that
persuade
an
army
commander
to
any
course
of
military
conduct
must
of
necessity
be
a
closed
book
to
the
individual
soldier
to
the
fighting
man
himself
and
to
the
man
on
the
lines
of
communication
who
helps
to
feed
and
clothe
and
arm
and
doctor
him
the
history
of
his
particular
war
is
very
meagre
war
to
the
soldier
is
limited
to
the
very
narrow
horizon
of
his
front
the
daily
work
of
his
regiment
or
at
the
most
of
his
brigade
rarely
does
news
from
the
rest
of
one
brigade
spread
to
the
troops
of
another
in
the
field
only
in
the
hospital
that
serves
the
division
are
the
events
of
his
bit
of
war
correlated
and
reduced
to
a
comprehensive
whole
even
then
the
resulting
knowledge
is
usually
wrong
for
the
imagination
of
officers
and
of
men
in
particular
is
wonderful
and
rumour
has
its
birthplace
in
the
hospital
ward
one
may
take
it
as
an
established
fact
that
the
ordinary
regimental
officer
or
soldier
knows
little
or
nothing
about
events
other
than
his
particular
bit
of
country
only
the
staff
know
and
they
will
not
tell
sometimes
we
have
thought
that
all
the
real
news
lives
in
the
cloistered
brain
of
the
general
and
his
chief
of
staff
be
this
as
it
may
we
always
got
fuller
and
better
correlated
and
news
of
the
german
east
african
campaign
from
reuter
or
from
weekly
edition
but
if
the
soldier
in
the
forward
division
knows
nothing
of
the
strategical
events
of
his
war
there
are
many
things
of
which
he
does
know
and
so
well
too
that
they
eclipse
the
greater
strategical
considerations
of
the
war
he
does
know
the
food
he
eats
and
the
food
that
he
would
like
to
eat
moreover
he
knew
in
german
east
africa
what
his
rations
ought
to
be
and
how
to
do
without
them
he
learnt
how
to
fight
and
march
and
carry
heavy
equipment
on
a
very
empty
stomach
he
learnt
to
eke
out
his
meagre
supplies
by
living
on
the
wild
game
of
the
country
the
native
flour
bananas
and
mangoes
he
knew
what
it
meant
to
have
dysentery
and
malaria
he
had
marched
under
a
broiling
sun
by
day
and
shivered
in
the
tropic
dews
at
night
he
knew
what
it
was
to
sleep
upon
the
ground
to
hunt
for
shade
from
the
vertical
sun
these
and
many
other
things
did
he
know
and
herein
lies
the
chief
interest
of
this
or
of
any
other
campaign
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
soldier
in
east
africa
was
more
concerned
about
his
food
and
clothing
the
tea
he
thirsted
for
the
blisters
that
tormented
his
weary
feet
the
equipment
that
was
so
heavy
the
sleep
that
drugged
his
footsteps
on
the
march
the
lion
that
sniffed
around
his
drowsy
head
at
night
than
about
the
actual
fighting
these
are
the
real
points
of
personal
interest
in
any
campaign
and
if
these
sketches
bear
upon
the
questions
of
food
the
matter
of
transport
the
manner
of
the
soldier
illness
the
hospitals
he
stayed
in
the
tsetse
fly
that
bit
him
by
day
the
mosquitoes
that
made
his
nights
a
perfect
torment
they
are
the
more
true
to
life
for
fights
are
few
and
in
this
thick
bush
country
frequently
degenerate
into
blind
firing
into
a
blinder
bush
but
the
jigger
flea
is
with
the
soldier
always
but
this
campaign
is
far
different
from
any
of
the
others
in
which
our
arms
are
at
present
engaged
first
and
of
especial
interest
was
this
army
of
ours
the
most
heterogeneous
collection
of
fighting
men
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
all
gathered
in
one
smoothly
working
homogeneous
whole
from
boers
and
british
south
africans
from
canada
and
australia
from
india
from
home
from
the
planters
of
east
africa
and
from
all
the
dusky
tribes
of
central
africa
was
this
army
of
ours
recruited
the
country
too
was
of
such
a
character
that
knowledge
of
war
in
other
campaigns
was
of
little
value
thick
grass
dense
thorn
scrub
high
elephant
grass
all
had
their
special
bearing
on
the
quality
of
the
fighting
engagements
were
the
rule
dirty
fighting
in
the
jungle
ambushes
patrol
encounters
and
the
deadly
that
enfiladed
or
swept
every
open
space
we
can
not
be
surprised
that
the
mounted
arm
was
robbed
of
much
of
its
utility
that
artillery
work
was
often
blind
for
want
of
observation
that
the
trench
dug
in
the
green
heart
of
a
forest
escaped
the
watchful
eyes
of
aeroplanes
that
this
war
became
a
fight
of
men
and
rifles
and
above
all
the
in
this
campaign
the
hun
has
been
the
least
of
the
malignant
influences
more
from
fever
and
dysentery
from
biting
flies
from
ticks
and
crawling
beasts
have
we
suffered
than
from
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
lions
and
hyaenas
have
been
our
camp
followers
and
not
a
little
are
we
grateful
to
these
wonderful
scavengers
the
best
of
all
possible
allies
in
settling
the
great
question
of
sanitation
in
camps
for
all
our
roads
were
marked
by
the
bodies
of
dead
horses
mules
and
oxen
whose
stench
filled
the
evening
air
much
labour
in
the
distasteful
jobs
of
burying
these
poor
victims
of
war
did
the
scavengers
of
the
forest
save
us
the
transport
suffered
from
three
great
scourges
the
pest
of
and
fly
and
the
calamity
of
rain
for
after
twelve
rain
in
that
black
cotton
soil
never
a
wheel
could
move
until
a
hot
sun
had
dried
the
surface
of
the
roads
again
roads
too
were
mere
bush
tracks
in
the
forest
either
in
dust
or
in
greasy
clinging
mud
never
has
napoleon
maxim
that
an
army
fights
on
its
stomach
been
better
exemplified
than
here
all
this
campaign
we
have
marched
away
from
our
dinners
as
the
hun
has
marched
toward
his
the
line
of
retreat
predetermined
by
the
enemy
placed
him
in
the
fortunate
position
that
the
further
he
marched
the
more
food
he
got
the
softer
bed
more
ammunition
and
the
moral
comfort
of
his
big
naval
guns
that
he
fought
to
a
standstill
and
then
abandoned
heavy
artillery
meant
hundreds
of
native
porters
or
humped
oxen
of
the
country
to
drag
them
and
heavy
roads
defied
the
most
powerful
machinery
to
move
the
guns
in
order
to
appreciate
the
great
difficulty
with
which
our
supply
department
has
had
to
contend
we
must
remember
that
our
lines
of
communication
have
been
among
the
longest
in
any
campaign
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
railway
and
the
road
haul
of
supplies
our
lines
of
communication
have
been
longer
than
those
in
the
war
for
every
pound
of
bully
beef
or
biscuit
or
box
of
ammunition
has
been
landed
at
kilindini
our
sea
base
from
england
or
australia
railed
up
to
voi
or
nairobi
a
journey
roughly
of
miles
from
one
or
other
of
those
distributing
points
the
trucks
have
had
to
be
dragged
to
moschi
on
the
german
railway
from
there
eastward
along
the
german
railway
line
to
tanga
as
far
as
korogwe
a
matter
of
another
miles
from
here
the
last
stage
of
miles
has
been
covered
by
ox
or
mule
or
horse
transport
and
the
motor
lorry
over
these
bush
tracks
to
morogoro
can
we
wonder
then
that
the
great
object
of
this
campaign
has
been
to
raise
as
many
supplies
locally
as
possible
and
to
drive
our
beef
upon
the
hoof
in
the
rear
of
our
advancing
army
nor
is
the
german
unconscious
of
these
our
difficulties
he
has
with
the
greatest
care
denuded
the
whole
country
of
supplies
before
us
and
called
in
to
his
aid
his
two
great
allies
the
tsetse
fly
and
horse
sickness
to
rob
us
of
our
live
cattle
and
transport
animals
on
the
way
at
first
we
thought
the
german
in
east
africa
to
be
a
better
fellow
than
his
brother
in
europe
more
merciful
to
his
wounded
prisoner
more
chivalrous
in
his
manner
of
fighting
but
the
more
we
learn
of
him
the
more
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
the
same
old
hun
as
he
is
in
belgium
infinitely
crafty
incredibly
beastly
in
his
dealings
with
his
natives
and
with
our
prisoners
only
in
one
aspect
did
we
find
him
different
and
this
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
we
were
winning
and
advancing
taking
his
plantations
and
his
farms
finding
that
he
had
left
his
women
and
children
to
our
charge
then
we
saw
the
alteration
for
i
had
known
what
eight
months
in
german
prisons
in
europe
mean
to
a
soldier
prisoner
of
war
and
now
i
had
german
prisoners
in
my
charge
anxious
to
please
eager
to
conciliate
as
infinitely
servile
to
us
now
they
were
in
captivity
as
they
were
vile
and
bestial
and
arrogant
to
us
when
they
were
in
authority
were
these
prisoners
of
ours
nor
was
this
the
only
aspect
from
which
the
campaign
in
german
east
africa
appealed
to
those
of
us
who
had
taken
part
in
the
advance
from
the
marne
to
the
aisne
in
september
then
we
saw
what
looting
meant
and
how
the
german
officer
enriched
his
family
home
with
trophies
looted
from
many
chateaux
we
knew
of
french
houses
that
had
been
stripped
of
every
article
of
value
we
saw
discarded
by
the
roadside
in
the
rapid
and
disorganised
retreat
to
the
aisne
statuary
and
bronzes
pictures
and
clocks
and
all
the
treasures
of
french
homes
now
we
were
in
a
position
to
loot
but
how
differently
our
officers
and
men
behaved
the
spoils
of
hundreds
of
german
plantations
at
our
mercy
and
hardly
a
thing
save
what
was
urgently
needed
for
hospitals
or
food
taken
every
house
in
which
the
german
owner
lived
was
left
unmolested
only
those
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
the
native
plunderer
had
we
entered
it
pays
a
great
tribute
to
the
natural
goodness
of
our
men
that
the
german
example
of
indiscriminate
looting
and
destruction
was
not
followed
to
people
in
england
and
indeed
to
many
soldiers
in
france
it
seemed
that
this
campaign
of
ours
in
german
east
africa
was
a
mere
it
appeared
to
be
a
opportunity
to
escape
the
cold
wet
misery
of
the
trenches
in
flanders
to
some
it
spelt
an
expedition
of
the
picnic
variety
they
saw
in
this
an
opportunity
of
spending
halcyon
days
in
the
game
preserves
glorious
opportunities
for
making
collections
of
big
game
heads
all
sandwiched
in
with
pleasant
and
successful
enterprises
against
an
enemy
that
was
waiting
only
a
decent
excuse
to
surrender
how
different
has
been
the
reality
however
the
picnic
enterprise
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
arduous
in
our
experience
many
of
us
had
served
in
france
and
the
dardanelles
before
and
we
thought
we
knew
what
the
hardships
of
war
could
mean
if
the
truth
be
told
the
soldier
suffered
in
east
africa
in
many
ways
greater
hardships
performed
greater
feats
of
endurance
endured
more
from
fever
and
dysentery
and
the
many
plagues
of
the
country
than
in
either
of
the
other
campaigns
the
soldier
marched
and
fought
and
suffered
and
starved
for
the
simple
reason
that
time
was
of
the
essence
of
the
whole
campaign
from
june
until
christmas
we
had
to
crowd
in
the
campaigning
of
a
whole
year
for
once
the
rains
had
started
all
fighting
was
perforce
at
an
end
once
the
transport
wheels
had
stopped
in
the
black
cotton
soil
mud
the
army
had
to
halt
all
the
time
the
great
aim
of
the
expedition
was
to
get
on
and
farther
on
we
had
to
advance
and
risk
the
shortage
of
supplies
or
we
would
never
reach
the
central
railway
and
there
was
not
a
soldier
who
would
not
prefer
to
push
on
and
suffer
and
finish
the
campaign
than
wait
in
elegant
leisure
with
full
rations
to
contemplate
an
endless
war
in
the
swamps
of
east
africa
the
early
history
of
the
war
in
this
theatre
had
been
far
from
favourable
to
our
arms
in
late
our
expeditionary
force
failed
in
their
landing
at
tanga
a
misfortune
that
was
not
compensated
for
by
our
subsequent
reverse
at
jassin
near
the
border
on
the
coast
the
gallant
though
unsuccessful
defence
of
the
latter
town
by
our
indian
troops
however
caused
great
losses
to
the
enemy
and
robbed
him
of
many
of
his
most
distinguished
officers
but
against
these
we
must
record
the
very
fine
defence
of
the
uganda
railway
and
the
successful
affair
at
longido
near
the
great
magadi
soda
lake
in
the
kilimanjaro
area
but
when
south
africa
in
was
called
in
to
redress
the
balance
of
india
in
german
east
africa
the
new
strategic
railway
from
voi
to
the
german
frontier
was
only
just
commenced
and
the
enemy
were
in
occupation
of
our
territory
at
taveta
to
general
smuts
then
fell
the
task
of
the
various
units
in
british
east
africa
strengthening
them
with
south
african
troops
pushing
on
the
railway
toward
moschi
and
driving
the
german
from
british
soil
in
so
far
as
his
initial
movements
were
concerned
general
smuts
carried
out
the
plans
evolved
by
his
predecessors
after
a
series
of
difficult
but
brilliant
engagements
the
enemy
were
forced
back
to
moschi
and
to
the
kilimanjaro
area
which
in
places
was
very
strongly
held
from
this
point
he
mapped
out
his
own
campaign
colonel
von
lettow
was
by
our
flanking
movements
and
forced
to
retire
partly
along
the
tanga
railway
eastward
to
the
sea
and
partly
towards
the
central
railway
in
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
two
outstanding
features
of
this
campaign
may
be
mentioned
the
faith
the
whole
army
had
in
general
smuts
the
loyalty
absolute
and
complete
that
all
our
heterogeneous
troops
gave
to
him
and
the
natural
goodness
of
the
soldier
as
for
the
latter
boer
or
english
canadian
east
african
or
indian
all
showed
that
they
could
bear
the
heat
and
dust
and
dirty
fighting
the
disease
and
privation
just
as
gallantly
uncomplainingly
and
well
as
did
their
british
comrades
on
the
western
front
finally
there
is
one
very
generous
tribute
that
our
army
would
pay
to
the
germans
in
the
field
and
that
is
to
the
excellence
of
the
leadership
of
lettow
and
the
devotion
with
which
he
has
by
threats
and
cajolings
sustained
the
failing
courage
of
his
men
nor
can
one
forget
that
in
this
war
the
mainstay
of
our
enemy
has
lain
in
the
discipline
and
devotion
of
the
native
troops
here
indeed
in
this
campaign
the
black
man
has
kept
up
the
spirit
of
the
white
nor
does
this
leave
the
future
unclouded
with
potential
trouble
for
in
this
war
the
black
man
has
seen
the
white
on
both
sides
run
from
him
the
black
man
is
armed
and
trained
in
the
use
of
the
rifle
and
and
his
intelligence
and
capacity
have
been
attested
to
by
the
degree
of
fire
control
that
he
mastered
it
must
be
more
than
a
coincidence
that
in
the
two
colonies
east
africa
and
the
cameroon
where
the
germans
used
native
troops
they
put
up
an
efficient
and
skilful
resistance
while
in
africa
where
all
the
enemy
troops
were
white
they
showed
little
inclination
for
a
fight
to
a
finish
in
colonel
von
the
german
army
has
one
of
the
most
able
and
resourceful
leaders
that
it
has
produced
in
this
war
this
army
of
ours
since
alexander
of
macedon
descended
upon
the
plains
of
india
there
can
never
have
been
so
strange
and
heterogeneous
an
army
as
this
and
a
doctor
must
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
angels
to
arrive
at
an
even
approximate
understanding
of
their
varied
ailments
the
first
division
that
came
with
jan
smuts
from
the
snows
of
kilimanjaro
to
the
torrid
delta
of
the
rufigi
contained
them
all
the
real
history
of
the
war
begins
with
smuts
for
prior
to
his
coming
we
were
merely
at
war
but
when
he
came
we
began
to
fight
a
brief
hours
in
nairobi
during
which
he
avoided
the
public
receptions
and
the
dinners
that
a
more
social
chief
would
have
graced
then
he
was
off
into
the
bush
wherever
that
rather
short
but
figure
appeared
with
his
red
beard
well
streaked
with
grey
beneath
the
red
staff
cap
confidence
reigned
in
all
our
troops
and
to
the
end
this
trust
has
remained
unabated
many
disappointments
have
come
his
way
more
from
his
own
mounted
troops
than
from
any
others
but
we
have
felt
that
his
tactics
and
strategy
were
never
wrong
thus
it
was
that
from
this
heterogeneous
army
imperial
east
african
indian
and
south
african
he
has
had
a
loyalty
most
splendid
all
the
time
he
may
have
pushed
us
forward
so
that
we
marched
far
in
advance
of
food
or
supplies
thrust
us
into
advanced
positions
that
to
our
military
sense
seemed
very
hazardous
but
he
meant
getting
a
move
on
and
we
knew
it
and
all
of
us
wished
the
war
to
be
over
jan
smuts
suffered
the
same
fever
as
we
did
ate
our
food
and
his
personal
courage
in
private
and
most
risky
reconnaissances
filled
us
with
admiration
and
fear
lest
disaster
from
some
german
patrol
might
overtake
him
to
me
the
absence
of
criticism
and
the
loyal
of
all
troops
have
been
most
wonderful
for
we
are
an
incurably
critical
people
and
here
was
a
civilian
come
to
wrest
victory
from
a
series
of
disasters
first
in
interest
perhaps
as
they
were
ever
first
in
fight
are
the
rhodesians
those
careless
graceful
fellows
that
have
been
here
a
year
before
the
big
advance
began
straight
from
the
bush
country
and
fever
of
northern
rhodesia
they
were
probably
the
best
equipped
of
all
white
troops
to
meet
the
vicissitudes
of
this
warfare
they
knew
the
dangers
of
the
native
paths
that
wound
their
way
through
the
thorn
bush
and
gave
such
opportunities
for
ambush
to
the
lurking
patrol
none
knew
as
they
how
to
avoid
the
inviting
open
space
giving
so
good
a
field
of
fire
for
the
that
took
such
toll
of
all
our
enterprises
with
them
too
they
brought
a
liability
to
blackwater
fever
that
laid
them
low
a
legacy
from
lake
nyasa
that
marked
them
out
as
the
victims
of
this
scourge
in
the
first
year
of
the
big
advance
the
loyal
north
lancashires
too
have
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
from
the
first
disastrous
landing
at
tanga
always
exceedingly
well
disciplined
they
yield
to
none
in
the
amount
of
solid
unrewarded
work
done
in
this
campaign
of
the
most
romantic
interest
probably
are
the
royal
fusiliers
the
legion
of
frontiersmen
volumes
might
be
written
of
the
varied
careers
and
wild
lives
lived
by
these
strange
soldiers
of
fortune
they
were
led
by
colonel
driscoll
who
for
all
his
sixty
years
has
found
no
work
too
arduous
and
no
climate
too
unhealthy
for
his
brave
spirit
i
knew
him
in
the
boer
war
when
he
commanded

of
happy
though
irregular
memory

those
days

of
their
slouch

and

throughout
the
country
wherever
there
was

to
be

the
fusiliers
too
were
out
here
in
the
early
days

participated
in

strange
to
say
feared
exceedingly
the
wild
denizens
of
the
scrub
that
sniffed
around
his
patrol
at
night
of
our
indian
forces
the
most
likeable
and
attractive
were
the
kashmiris

the
patriot

of
kashmir
has
given
to
the
india
government
recruited
from
the
mountains
of

for
the

no

they
meet
one
everywhere
with
their
eager
smiling
faces
in
hospital
they
are
always
professing
to
a
recovery
from
fever
that
their
pallid
faces
and
enlarged
spleens
belie
and
they
take
not
kindly
to
any
suggestion
of
invaliding
these
battalions
of
kashmir
rifles
the
baluchis
and
the
king
african
rifles
have
done
more
dirty
bush
fighting
than
any
troops
in
this
campaign
the
baluchis
in
particular
have
covered
themselves
with
glory
in
many
a
fight
the
most
efficient
soldiers
in
east
africa
are
the
king
african
rifles
unaffected
by
the
fever
and
the
dysentery
of
the
country
and
led
by
picked
white
officers
they
are
in
their
element
in
the
thorn
jungle
in
which
the
germans
have
conducted
their
rearguard
actions
known
at
first
as
the
suicides
club
the
king
african
rifles
lost
a
far
greater
proportion
of
officers
than
any
other
regiment
nor
is
it
a
little
that
they
owe
to
the
gallant
leader
of
one
battalion
colonel
graham
who
lost
his
life
early
in

most
important
the

coming
spelt
for
us
the
big
advance
and
the
swift
move
that
made
us
master
of
the
whole
country
from
kilimanjaro
to
the
rufigi
a
great
political
experiment
and
a
most
wonderfully
successful
one
was
this
africander
army
english
and
boers
under
a
boer
general
for
the
first
time
since
the
great
war
in
south
africa
the
boers
made
common
cause
with
us
definitely
aligned
themselves
with
us
in
a
joint
campaign
and
provided
the
greatest
object
lesson
of
this
world
war
if
the
campaign
of
german
east
africa
was
worth
while
its
value
has
been
abundantly
proved
in
this
welding
of
the
races
that
despite
local
disagreements
has
occurred
the
south
african
troops
have
found
the
country
ill
adapted
to
their
peculiar
genius
in
war
and
the
blind
bush
has
robbed
the
mounted
arm
of
much
of
its
efficiency
not
here
the
wide
distances
to
favour
their
enveloping
tactics
much
have
they
suffered
from
fever
hardships
and
privation
and
to
their
credit
lies
the
greatest
of
all
marches
in
this
campaign
the
mile
march
to
kondoa
irangi
in
the
height
of
the
rainy
season
the
south
african
infantry
arrived
in
kondoa
starved
and
worn
and
bootless
after
this
forced
march
to
extricate
the
mounted
troops
whose
impetuous
ardour
had
thrust
them
far
beyond
the
possibility
of
supplies
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
we
can
not
sufficiently
praise
the
apparently
reckless
tactics
that
made
this
wonderful
march
towards
the
central
railway
or
the
uncomplaining
fortitude
of
troops
who
lived
in
this
country
on
hippopotamus
meat
wild
game
and
native
meal
to
the
boer
as
to
all
of
us
this
campaign
must
have
taught
a
wonderful
lesson
for
many
prejudices
have
been
modified
and
it
has
been
learnt
that
coolies
as
only
too
often
the
ignorant
style
all
natives
of
india
and
kaffirs
can
fight
with
the
best
this
campaign
would
have
been
largely
impossible
were
it
not
for
the
cape
boys
and
other
natives
from
the
union
who
have
come
to
run
our
mule
and
ox
transport
their
peculiar
genius
is
the
management
of
horses
mules
and
cattle
different
from
other
primitive
and
negro
people
they
are
very
kind
to
animals
infinitely
knowledgeable
in
the
lore
of
mule
and
ox
they
can
be
depended
upon
to
exact
the
most
from
animal
transport
with
the
least
cruelty
wonderful
riders
these
i
have
seen
them
sit
bucking
horses
in
a
way
that
a
texas
cowboy
or
a
mexican
might
envy
one
should
not
leave
the
subject
of
this
army
without
reference
to
the
cape
corps
that
experiment
in
military
recruiting
which
many
of
us
were
at
first
inclined
to
condemn
but
from
the
moment
the
cape
boy
enlisted
in
the
ranks
of
the
cape
corps
his
status
was
raised
and
he
adopted
together
with
his
regulation
khaki
uniform
and
helmet
a
higher
responsibility
towards
the
army
than
did
his
brother
who
helped
to
run
the
transport
they
have
been
well
officered
they
have
been
a
lesson
to
all
of
us
in
the
essential
matters
of
discipline
and
smartness
they
have
done
much
of
the
dirty
work
entailed
by
guarding
lines
of
communication
and
now
when
given
their
chance
of
actual
fighting
on
the
rufigi
they
have
covered
themselves
with
distinction
for
my
part
as
a
doctor
i
found
they
had
too
much
ego
in
their
cosmos
as
is
commonly
the
fault
of
races
and
a
sick
cape
corps
soldier
seemed
always
very
sick
indeed
yet
as
the
campaign
progressed
we
came
to
like
and
to
admire
these
troops
the
more
so
that
their
distinction
won
in
the
rufigi
fighting
was
welcomed
very
gladly
by
all
of
us
later
in
the
campaign
arrived
the
gold
coast
regiment
and
now
the
nigerian
brigade
are
here
very
very
smart
and
these
hausa
and
fulani
troops
mohammedan
largely
in
religion
and
bearded
where
the
east
coast
native
is
they
will
stay
to
finish
this
guerilla
fighting
for
which
their
experience
in
the
cameroon
has
so
well
fitted
them
the
gold
coast
regiment
has
always
been
where
there
has
been
the
hardest
fighting
their
green
woollen
caps
and
leather
sandals
marking
them
out
from
other
negroid
soldiers
and
their
impetuous
courage
has
won
them
many
captured
enemy
guns
and
alas
a
very
long
list
of
casualties
but
in
hospital
they
are
the
merriest
of
happy
people
always
joking
and
smiling
and
are
quite
a
contrast
to
our
much
more
serious
east
coast
native
they
have
earned
from
their
white
sergeants
and
officers
very
great
admiration
and
devotion
by
far
the
best
equipped
of
any
unit
in
the
field
they
had
as
a
regiment
no
less
than
eight
and
a
regimental
mountain
battery
the
navy
and
its
work
to
the
navy
that
alone
has
made
this
campaign
possible
we
soldiers
owe
our
grateful
thanks
but
there
have
been
times
when
in
our
blindness
we
have
failed
to
realise
how
great
the
task
was
to
blockade
miles
of
this
coast
and
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
mozambique
for
before
the
portuguese
made
common
cause
with
us
there
was
a
great
deal
of
along
the
southern
border
of
german
east
africa
which
our
present
allies
found
impossible
to
watch
two
factors
materially
aided
the
germans
in
making
the
fight
they
have
first
there
was
the
lucky
coincidence
of
the
exhibition
this
exhibition
which
was
to
bring
the
whole
world
to
german
east
africa
in
august
provided
the
military
authorities
with
great
supplies
of
machinery
stores
and
exhibits
from
all
the
big
industrial
centres
and
these
were
swiftly
adapted
to
the
making
of
rifles
and
munitions
of
war
to
this
must
be
added
the
most
important
factor
of
all
the
lying
on
the
mud
flats
far
up
the
rufigi
destroyed
by
us
it
is
true
but
not
before
the
ship
company
of
officers
and
men
and
most
of
the
guns
had
been
transported
ashore
the
latter
mounted
on
gun
carriages
and
dragged
by
weary
oxen
or
thousands
of
black
porters
to
dispute
our
advance
in
due
course
however
these
were
abandoned
one
by
one
as
we
pressed
the
enemy
back
from
the
northern
railway
south
to
the
rufigi
last
but
by
no
means
least
was
the
moral
support
their
wireless
stations
gave
them
these
though
unable
since
the
destruction
of
the
main
stations
to
transmit
messages
continued
for
some
time
to
receive
the
news
from
nauen
in
germany
by
the
air
from
germany
the
officers
received
the
iron
cross
promotion
and
the
emperor
grateful
thanks
but
if
you
would
see
what
work
the
navy
has
done
you
must
first
begin
at
lindi
in
the
south
there
you
will
see
the
of
the
line
lying
on
her
side
with
her
propellers
blown
off
and
waiting
for
our
tugs
to
drag
her
to
durban
for
repair
and
in
the
rufigi
lying
on
the
mudbanks
fourteen
miles
from
the
mouth
you
will
see
the
once
the
pride
of
german
cruisers
half
sunk
and
completely
dismantled
the
hippopotami
scratch
their
flanks
upon
her
rusted
sides
crocodiles
crawl
across
her
decks
fish
swim
through
the
open
ports
in
you
will
see
the
stranded
at
the
harbour
mouth
the
lying
on
her
side
behind
the
ineffectual
shelter
of
the
land
the
side
uppermost
innocent
of
the
red
cross
and
green
line
that
adorned
her
seaward
side
for
she
was
a
mysterious
craft
she
flew
the
red
cross
and
was
tricked
out
as
a
hospital
ship
on
one
side
the
other
painted
grey
true
she
had
patients
and
a
doctor
on
board
when
a
pinnace
from
one
of
our
cruisers
examined
her
but
she
also
had
mounted
and
gun
emplacements
screwed
to
her
deck
and
all
the
adaptations
required
for
a
commerce
raider
so
our
admiral
decided
that
after
due
notice
so
suspicious
a
craft
were
better
sunk
a
few
shots
flooded
her
compartments
and
she
heeled
over
burying
the
lying
cross
of
geneva
beneath
the
waters
of
the
harbour
further
up
the
creek
you
will
see
the
afloat
and
uninjured
save
for
the
engines
that
our
naval
party
had
destroyed
and
ready
to
our
amazement
at
the
capture
of
the
town
to
be
towed
to
durban
and
to
carry
british
freight
to
british
ports
and
maybe
meet
a
destroying
german
submarine
upon
the
way
further
up
still
you
will
find
the
governor
yacht
and
a
gunboat
sunk
this
time
by
the
germans
but
easy
to
raise
and
to
adapt
for
our
service
strange
that
so
methodical
a
people
should
have
bungled
so
badly
the
simple
task
of
rendering
a
valuable
ship
useless
for
the
enemy
but
they
have
blundered
in
the
execution
of
their
plans
everywhere
the
attempt
to
obstruct
the
harbour
mouth
at
was
typical
of
their
naval
ineptitude
barely
two
hundred
yards
across
this
it
should
have
been
an
easy
job
to
block
so
they
sank
the
floating
dock
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
channel
and
moored
the
by
bow
and
stern
hawsers
to
the
shores
on
either
side
in
position
for
sinking
instead
of
flooding
her
they
prepared
an
explosive
bomb
and
timed
it
to
go
off
at
the
fall
of
the
tide
but
the
bomb
failed
to
explode
and
an
ebb
tide
setting
in
broke
the
stern
moorings
and
drove
her
sideways
on
the
shore
here
she
lies
now
and
the
channel
is
still
free
to
all
our
ships
to
come
and
go
we
found
at
the
occupation
the
record
of
the
on
the
german
naval
officer
responsible
for
the
failure
of
the
plan
he
seems
to
have
pleaded
with
success
the
fact
that
his
dynamite
was
fifteen
years
old
after
that
no
further
attempt
was
made
and
for
nearly
a
year
before
we
occupied
the
town
our
naval
whalers
and
small
cruisers
sailed
the
white
ensign
proudly
flying
into
the
harbour
to
anchor
and
to
watch
the
interned
shipping
it
must
have
been
a
humiliating
spectacle
to
the
hun
but
he
was
helpless
woe
betide
him
if
he
placed
a
mine
or
trained
a
gun
upon
this
ship
of
ours
the
town
would
have
suffered
and
this
they
could
not
risk
yet
further
up
the
coast
near
tanga
the
lies
beached
in
shallow
water
and
the
a
wreck
in
mansa
bay
in
most
of
our
naval
operations
our
intelligence
has
been
excellent
and
fortune
has
been
kind
it
seemed
to
the
germans
that
we
employed
some
special
witchcraft
to
provide
the
knowledge
that
we
possessed
so
they
panicked
ingloriously
and
sought
spies
everywhere
and
hanged
inoffensive
natives
by
the
dozen
to
the
mango
trees
one
day
one
of
our
whalers
entered
tanga
harbour
the
very
day
the
german
mines
were
lifted
for
the
periodical
overhaul
the
germans
ascribed
such
knowledge
to
the
prince
of
evil
the
whaler
proceeded
to
destroy
a
ship
lying
there
and
on
its
way
out
fired
a
shell
into
a
lighter
that
was
lying
near
in
this
lighter
were
the
mines
as
the
resulting
explosion
testified
this
completed
the
german
belief
in
our
possession
of
supernatural
powers
of
obtaining
information
again
at
the
bombardment
and
capture
of
bagamoyo
by
the
fleet
it
seemed
to
the
hun
that
wherever
the
german
commander
went
to
this
trench
or
to
that
observation
post
our
shells
would
follow
him
all
day
long
they
pursued
his
footsteps
till
he
also
panicked
and
searched
the
bush
for
a
hidden
wireless
he
it
was
who
shot
our
gallant
marine
officer
as
our
men
stormed
the
trenches
and
paid
the
penalty
for
his
rashness
shortly
after
the
little
german
tug
which
in
times
of
peace
plied
across
the
bar
at
chinde
to
bring
off
passengers
and
mails
to
the
ships
that
lay
outside
has
had
a
chequered
career
in
this
war
slipping
out
from
chinde
at
the
outbreak
of
war
she
made
her
way
to
from
there
she
essayed
another
escapade
only
to
fall
into
our
hands
transformed
into
a
gunboat
she
harried
the
germans
in
the
delta
of
the
rufigi
until
greatly
daring
one
day
she
ran
ashore
on
a
mudbank
in
the
river
captured
with
her
crew
she
was
taken
to
pieces
by
the
germans
and
transported
by
rail
to
ujiji
on
lake
tanganyika
and
there
the
belgians
found
her
partly
reconstructed
as
they
entered
the
harbour
a
little
longer
delay
and
the
resurrected
would
have
played
havoc
with
our
small
craft
and
the
belgians
which
had
driven
the
german
ships
off
the
vast
waters
of
this
lake

and
his
army

to
give
him
his
full
title
colonel
von
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
german
resistance
in
east
africa
indomitable
and
ubiquitous
he
has
kept
up
the
drooping
spirits
of
his
men
by
encouragement
by
the
example
of
great
personal
courage
and
by
threats
that
he
can
and
will
carry
out
wounded
three
times
he
has
never
left
his
army
but
has
been
carried
about
on
a
machela
to
prevent
the
that
leads
to
surrender
and
now
we
hear
he
has
had
blackwater
and
recovering
has
resumed
his
elusive
journeys
from
one
discouraged
company
to
another
all
over
the
narrowing
area
of
operations
that
alone
is
left
to
the
hun
of
his
favourite
colonial
possessions
for
to
the
fat
shipping
clerk
of
tanga
whose
soul
lives
only
for
beer
and
the
leave
that
comes
to
reward
two
years
of
effort
the
temptation
to
go
sick
or
to
get
lost
in
the
bush
in
front
of
our
advancing
armies
is
very
great
he
is
not
of
the
stuff
that
heroes
are
made
of
and
surrender
is
so
safe
and
easy
a
prison
camp
in
bombay
is
clearly
preferable
to
this
unending
retreat
he
has
done
enough
for
honour
he
argues
he
has
proved
his
worth
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
resistance
this
colony
has
put
up
the
best
fight
of
all
and
the
holds
the
seas
so
further
resistance
is
hopeless
we
are
not

are
we

to

he
learnt
in
the

at
milwaukee
in
days
that
now
seem
to
belong
to
some
antenatal

soon
he
will
look
for
some
white

beneath
the
strange

the

will
go
his

and

that
magic

but
lettow
is
going
all
out
his
black
askaris
are
not
discouraged
and
in
this
war
the
black

is
keeping
up
the
courage
of
the
white
had
the
native
soldiers
got
their
tails
down
the
game
was
up
as
far
as
the
germans
were
concerned
but
these
faithful
fellows
see
the
bwona
kuba
as
they
call
lettow
here
encouraging
everywhere
inspiring
them
by
his
example
and
they
will
stay
with
him
until
the
end
like
many
great
soldiers
lettow
is
singularly
careless
in
his
dress
and
the
tale
is
told
at
moschi
of
a
young
german
officer
who
stole
a
day
leave
and
discussed
with
a
stranger
at
a
shop
window
the
chances
of
the
ubiquitous
lettow
arriving
to
spoil
his
afternoon
nor
did
he
know
until
he
found
the
reprimand
awaiting
him
in
camp
that
he
had
been
discussing
the
ethics
of
breaking
out
of
camp
with
the
terror
himself
a
soldier
of
fortune
is
lettow
his
name
is
stained
with
the
hideous
massacres
of
the
hereros
in
africa
his
was
the
order
transmitted
through
the
german
governor
mouth
that
thrust
the
herero
women
and
children
into
the
deserts
of
damaraland
to
die
before
the
war
in
south
africa
rumour
says
he
was
instructor
to
the
staats
artillerie
which
kruger
raised
to
stay
the
storm
that
he
knew
inevitably
would
overwhelm
him
serving
with
smuts
and
botha
themselves
in
the
early
months
of
the
boer
war
he
joined
the
inglorious
procession
of
foreigners
that
fled
across
the
bridge
at
komati
poort
after
pretoria
fell
and
left
the
boer
to
fight
it
out
unaided
for
two
long
and
weary
years
more
no
wonder
that
lettow
has
sworn
never
to
surrender
to
that
damned
dutchman
jan
smuts
chary
of
giving
praise
for
work
well
done
he
yet
is
inexorable
to
failure
the
tale
is
told
that
lettow
was
furious
when
fischer
the
major
in
command
at
moschi
was
bluffed
out
of
his
impregnable
position
there
by
vandeventer
evacuated
the
northern
lines
and
retired
on
kahe
thus
saving
us
the
expense
of
taking
a
natural
fortress
that
would
have
taxed
all
our
energies
white
with
rage
he
sent
for
fischer
and
handed
him
one
of
his
own
revolvers
let
me
hear
some
interesting
news
about
you
in
a
day
or
two
and
fischer
took
the
pistol
and
walked
away
to
consider
his
death
warrant
he
looked
at
that
grim
message
for
two
days
before
he
could
summon
up
his
courage
then
he
shot
himself
well
below
the
heart
in
a
spot
that
he
thought
was
fairly
safe
but
poor
fischer
knowledge
of
anatomy
was
as
unsound
as
his
strategy
for
the
bullet
perforated
his
stomach
and
it
took
him
three
days
to
die
a
tribe
which
has
contributed
largely
to
the
german
military
forces
is
the
wanyamwezi
of
excellent
physique
they
long
resisted
german
domination
but
now
they
are
entirely
subdued
hardy
brave
and
willing
they
are
the
best
fighters

in
the
whole

do
not

to
fight
against
their
blood
brothers
there
is
no
stint
to
the
faithful
service
they
have
given
to
the
germans
but
for
them
our
task
would
have
been
much
easier
for
drilling
and
parade
the
native
mind
shows
great
keenness
and
aptitude
little
squads
of
men
are
drilled
voluntarily
by
their
own
in
their
spare
time
and
often
just
after
an
official
drill
is
over
they
drill
one
another
again
smart
and
they
are
most
punctilious
in
all
military
services
intelligence
of
all
the
departments
of
war
in
german
east
africa
probably
the
most
romantic
and
interesting
is
the
intelligence
department
far
away
ahead
of
the
fighting
troops
are
the
intelligence
officers
with
their
native
scouts
these
officers
for
the
most
part
are
men
who
have
lived
long
in
the
country
who
know
the
native
languages
and
are
familiar
with
the
lie
of
the
land
from
experience
gained
in
past
hunting
trips
often
behind
the
enemy
creeping
along
the
lines
of
communication
these
officers
carry
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
run
the
risk
of
betrayal
by
any
native
who
happens
across
them
sleeping
in
the
bush
at
night
unable
to
light
fires
to
cook
their
food
lest
the
light
should
attract
the
questing
patrol
that
learning
of
their
presence
in
the
country
has
been
out
after
them
for
days
hiding
in
the
bush
short
of
rations
the
little
luxuries
of
civilisation
long
since
finished
forced
to
smoke
the
reeking
pungent
native
tobacco
living
off
wild
game
that
must
be
trapped
not
shot
and
native
meal
at
the
mercy
of
the
natives
whom
both
sides
employ
to
get
information
of
the
other
these
men
are
in
constant
danger
nor
are
the
amenities
of
civilised
warfare
theirs
when
capture
is
their
lot
fortunately
for
the
british
empire
there
has
never
been
any
lack
of
those
restless
beings
whose
wandering
spirits
lead
them
to
the
confines
of
civilisation
and
beyond
to
this
type
of
man
the
african
continent
has
offered
a
particular
attraction
and
we
should
have
fared
badly
in
the
east
african
campaign
if
we
could
not
have
relied
upon
the
services
of
many
of
them
they
are
for
the
most
part
men
who
have
abandoned
at
an
early
age
the
prosaic
existence
previously
mapped
out
for
them
and
plunging
into
the
wilds
of
africa
have
found
a
more
attractive
livelihood
in
big
game
shooting
and
prospecting
by
far
the
most
exhilarating
calling
is
that
of
the
elephant
hunter
who
finds
in
the
profits
he
derives
from
it
all
the
compensation
he
requires
for
the
hardships
the
long
marches
and
the
grave
personal
dangers
in
the
most
inaccessible
parts
of
the
continent
he
plies
his
trade
knowing
that
his
life
may
depend
upon
the
quickness
of
his
eye
and
intellect
and
the
accuracy
of
his
aim
nor
are
his
troubles
over
when
his
quarry
has
been
secured
the
ivory
has
still
to
be
disposed
of
and
it
is
not
always
safe
to
attempt
to
sell
in
the
territory
where
the
game
has
been
shot
the
area
of
no
man
land
in
africa
has
long
since
been
a
diminishing
quantity
and
the
promiscuous
shooting
of
elephants
is
not
encouraged
it
becomes
necessary
therefore
to
study
the
question
of
markets
and
the
successful
hunter
finds
it
convenient
to
vary
the
spheres
of
his
activities
continually
not
the
least
of
the
assets
of
these
men
is
the
knowledge
they
have
of
the
native
and
the
hold
they
have
obtained
over
them
that
man
will
go
farthest
who
relies
on
the
respect
rather
than
on
the
fear
he
inspires
the
latter
may
go
a
long
way
but
unless
it
has
the
former
to
support
it
the
chances
are
against
it
sooner
or
later
one
man
i
know
of
owed
his
life
more
than
once
to
his
devotion
to
a
small
stick
that
walking
sitting
or
lying
he
never
allowed
out
of
his
hand
the
native
mind
came
to
attach
magical
powers
to
the
stick
and
consequently
to
the
man
himself
on
one
eventful
journey
when
he
had
gone
farther
afield
than
his
wont
and
farther
than
his
native
porters
cared
to
accompany
him
symptoms
of
mutiny
made
their
appearance
a
council
was
held
as
to
whether
he
should
be
murdered
or
not
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
overhear
it
the
only
possible
deterrent
seemed
to
be
a
dread
of
the
magical
stick
but
the
two
ringleaders
affected
to
make
light
of
it
realising
that
the
time
had
come
for
decisive
action
the
white
man
summoned
the
company
told
them
that
his
stick
had
revealed
the
plot
to
him
and
warned
them
of
the
danger
they
ran
to
clinch
his
argument
he
offered
to
allow
the
ringleaders
to
return
home
taking
the
stick
with
them
but
told
them
that
they
would
be
dead
within
hours
and
the
stick
would
come
back
to
him
to
his
dismay
they
accepted
the
challenge
and
for
him
there
could
be
no
retreat
in
desperation
he
poisoned
the
food
they
were
to
take
with
them
and
awaited
developments
the
two
natives
set
off
early
in
the
morning
by
the
afternoon
they
were
back
again
and
with
them
the
stick
in
the
solitude
of
their
homeward
trek
their
courage
had
oozed
out
they
feared
the
magic
and
fortunately
had
not
touched
the
poisoned
provisions
in
the
feasting
that
had
to
celebrate
this
satisfactory
denouement
it
was
possible
to
substitute
other
food
for
that
which
had
been
taken
on
the
abortive
journey
magic
or
the
fear
of
it
had
saved
the
situation
but
the
instincts
of
loyalty
had
been
fired
previously
by
a
character
that
had
many
attractive
features
and
never
allowed
firmness
to
dispossess
justice
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
two
of
our
nimrods
whom
i
shall
call
hallam
and
best
were
camped
by
the
rovuma
river
hearing
that
there
were
british
ships
at
lindi
they
made
for
the
coast
to
offer
their
services
in
the
sterner
hunt
after
much
more
dangerous
game
that
they
knew
had
now
begun
the
native
runner
that
brought
them
the
news
from
mozambique
also
warned
them
of
the
german
force
that
was
hot
foot
in
pursuit
of
them
so
they
tarried
not
in
the
order
of
their
going
and
made
for
the
shelter
of
the
fleet
but
best
would
read
his
weekly
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
at
their
camp
table
for
all
the
huns
in
christendom
he
said
and
derided
hallam
surer
sense
of
danger
near
at
hand
so
in
the
early
hours
their
pickets
came
running
in
all
mixed
up
with
german
askaris
and
the
ring
of
rifle
and
fire
told
them
that
their
time
had
come
capsizing
the
lamp
they
scattered
in
the
undergrowth
like
a
covey
of
partridges
hallam
badly
wounded
in
the
leg
and
only
able
to
crawl
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
papyrus
leaves
beside
the
was
his
refuge
and
as
he
plunged
into
the
river
the
scattered
volley
of
rifle
shots
tore
the
reeds
above
him
all
night
they
remained
there
hallam
up
to
his
neck
in
water
and
the
ready
prey
of
any
searching
crocodile
that
the
blood
that
oozed
from
his
wounded
leg
should
inevitably
have
attracted
the
germans
on
the
bank
next
morning
the
trail
of
blood
towards
the
river
assured
the
enemy
that
hallam
was
no
more
for
who
could
live
in
these
dangerous
waters
all
night
wounded
as
he
was
but
if
hallam
could
hunt
like
a
leopard
he
could
also
swim
like
a
fish
next
day
brought
a
native
fishing
canoe
into
sight
and
to
it
he
swam
still
clutching
the
rifle
that
second
nature
had
caused
him
to
grab
as
he
plunged
into
the
reeds
with
a
wet
rifle
and
nine
cartridges
he
persuaded
the
natives
not
only
to
ferry
him
across
to
the
portuguese
side
but
also
to
carry
him
in
a
machela
a
hammock
slung
between
native
porters
from
which
he
shot
impala
for
his
food
but
somehow
word
had
got
across
the
river
that
hallam
had
eluded
death
and
the
german
governor
stormed
and
threatened
till
the
portuguese
sent
police
to
arrest
the
fugitive
but
the
native
runner
who
brought
him
news
of
his
discovery
also
brought
word
of
the
approaching
police
so
with
his
rifle
and
three
cartridges
to
sustain
him
often
delirious
with
fever
and
the
inflammation
in
his
leg
he
commandeered
the
men
of
a
native
village
and
persuaded
them
such
was
the
prestige
of
his
name
to
carry
him
days
in
the
machela
to
a
friendly
mission
station
on
lake
nyasa
here
the
kindly
english
sisters
nursed
him
back
to
life
and
health
again
best
was
not
so
lucky
for
he
was
taken
prisoner
but
there
was
no
german
gaol
that
could
hold
so
resourceful
a
prisoner
as
this
in
due
time
he
made
his
escape
and
was
to
be
found
later
looping
the
loop
above
turkish
camps
in
the
sinai
peninsula
one
german
of
whom
our
information
had
been
that
his
company
did
little
else
but
rape
women
and
loot
goats
fell
into
my
hands
when
we
took
the
english
universities
mission
at
korogwe
could
this
be
he
i
thought
as
i
saw
an
officer
of
mild
appearance
and
benevolent
aspect
speaking
english
so
perfectly
and
peering
at
me
through
big
spectacles
badly
wounded
and
with
a
fracture
of
the
thigh
he
had
begged
me
to
look
after
him
saying
the
most
disloyal
things
about
the
character
and
surgical
capacity
of
the
german
doctor
whom
we
had
left
behind
to
look
after
german
wounded
not
that
the
did
not
deserve
them
but
it
was
so
gratuitously
beastly
to
say
them
to
me
an
enemy
he
deplored
too
with
such
unctuous
phrases
the
fact
that
war
should
ever
have
occurred
in
east
africa
how
it
would
spoil
the
years
of
toil
toward
christianity
of
many
mission
stations
how
the
simple
native
had
been
taught
in
this
war
to
kill
white
men
hitherto
of
course
the
vilest
of
crimes
how
the
march
of
civilisation
had
been
put
back
for
years
how
the
prestige
of
the
white
man
had
fallen
for
had
not
natives
seen
white
men
on
both
sides
run
away
before
them
many
such
pious
expressions
issued
from
his
lips
but
the
true
hun
character
came
out
when
he
asked
whether
the
hated
boers
were
coming
the
most
vindictive
expression
that
even
the
benevolent
spectacles
could
only
partly
modify
clouded
his
face
and
he
complained
to
me
most
bitterly
of
the
black
ingratitude
of
the
boers
toward
germany
all
my
life
from
boyhood
he
complained
have
i
not
subscribed
my
pfennigs
to
provide
christmas
presents
for
the
poor
boers
suffering
under
the
heel
of
england
did
not
german
girls
he
whined
knit
stockings
for
the
women
of
that
nation
that
was
so
akin
to
the
germans
in
blood
and
that
lay
so
pitifully
prostrate
beneath
the
feet
of
england
nor
would
he
be
appeased
until
i
assured
him
that
the
boers
were
far
away
another
whose
reputation
was
that
of
a
hard
case
and
addicted
to
drink
i
found
also
in
hospital
in
korogwe
recovered
from
an
operation
for
abscess
of
the
liver
and
living
in
hospital
with
his
wife
spruce
and
rather
jumpy
he
insisted
on
exhibiting
his
operation
wound
to
me
paying
heavy
compliments
to
english
skill
in
surgery
not
mark
you
that
he
had
any
but
the
greatest
contempt
that
all
german
doctors
too
profess
for
british
medicine
and
surgery
but
he
hoped
by
specious
praise
to
be
sent
to
wilhelmstal
and
not
to
join
the
other
prisoners
in
ahmednagar
bottles
of
ostentatiously
displayed
upon
his
table
might
have
suggested
what
his
bleary
eye
and
shaky
hands
belied
so
i
contented
myself
with
removing
the
pass
key
to
the
wine
cellar
that
lay
upon
the
sideboard
and
duly
marked
him
down
on
the
list
for
transfer
to
wilhelmstal
that
the
spirit
of
baron
munchausen
still
lives
in
german
east
africa
is
attested
to
by
intelligence
reports
it
says
a
great
deal
for
belief
in
the
accuracy
of
our
information
that
he
very
promptly
put
a
stop
to
the
notoriety
and
reputation
for
valour
that
two
german
officers
enjoyed
one
had
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
bomb
the
uganda
railway
on
two
occasions
but
neither
time
did
he
do
any
damage
though
on
each
occasion
he
claimed
to
have
cut
the
line
the
other
possessed
of
greater
imagination
reported
to
his
german
commander
that
he
had
attacked
one
of
our
posts
along
the
railway
completely
destroying
it
and
all
in
it
the
painful
truth
he
learnt
afterwards
from
german
headquarters
was
that
the
english
suffered
no
casualties
and
the
post
was
comparatively
undamaged
the
sad
fate
of
one
enterprising
german
officer
who
set
out
to
make
an
attack
upon
one
of
our
posts
was
at
the
time
the
cause
of
endless
jesting
at
the
expense
of
the
survey
and
topographical
department
of
british
east
africa
he
was
relying
upon
an
old
english
map
of
the
country
but
owing
to
its
extreme
inaccuracy
he
lost
his
way
ran
out
of
water
and
made
an
inglorious
surrender
this
of
course
was
attributed
by
the
germans
to
the
low
cunning
employed
by
our
intelligence
department
that
allowed
the
german
authorities
to
get
possession
of
a
misleading
map
that
retribution
follows
in
the
wake
of
an
unpopular
german
officer
as
shown
by
extracts
from
captured
german
diaries
is
attested
to
by
the
record
of
two
grim
tragedies
in
the
african
bush
one
of
an
officer
who
lost
his
way
the
other
of
an
officer
who
was
shot
by
his
own
men
german
treatment
of
natives
one
of
the
features
of
german
military
life
that
fills
one
with
horror
and
disgust
is
their
brutality
to
the
native
nor
do
they
make
any
attempt
to
cloak
their
atrocities
for
they
perpetuate
them
by
photographs
many
of
which
have
fallen
into
our
hands
and
from
these
one
sees
a
tendency
to
gloat
over
the
ghastly
exhibits
the
pictures
portray
gallows
with
a
large
number
of
natives
hanging
side
by
side
in
some
soldiers
are
drawn
up
in
hollow
square
one
side
of
it
open
to
the
civil
population
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
these
are
punitive
and
impressive
official
executions
carried
out
under
proper
judicial
conditions
as
conceived
by
germans
but
what
offends
one
taste
so
much
are
the
photographs
of
german
officers
and
men
standing
with
and
expressions
beside
the
grim
gallows
on
which
their
victims
hang
from
the
great
number
of
these
pictures
we
have
found
it
is
quite
clear
that
not
only
are
such
executions
very
common
but
that
they
are
also
not
unpleasing
to
the
sense
of
the
german
population
otherwise
they
would
not
bequeath
to
posterity
their
own
smiling
faces
alongside
the
unhappy
dead
with
us
it
is
so
different
when
we
have
to
administer
the
capital
penalty
we
do
it
of
course
openly
and
after
full
judicial
inquiry
in
open
court
nor
do
we
rob
it
of
its
impressive
character
by
excluding
the
native
population
but
such
sentences
in
war
are
usually
carried
out
by
shooting
and
photographs
are
not
desired
by
any
of
the
spectators
it
is
a
vile
business
and
absolutely
revolting
to
us
nor
do
we
hesitate
to
hurry
away
as
soon
as
the
official
character
of
the
parade
is
over
i
well
remember
one
such
execution
in
morogoro
of
a
german
askari
who
assaulted
a
little
german
girl
with
a
kiboko
during
the
two
days
interregnum
that
elapsed
between
lettow
departure
and
our
occupation
of
the
town
to
british
troops
the
most
unwelcome
duty
of
all
is
to
form
a
part
of
a
firing
party
on
such
occasions
the
firing
party
are
handed
their
rifles
alternate
weapons
only
loaded
with
ball
cartridge
that
their
sense
of
decency
may
not
be
offended
by
the
distasteful
recollection
of
killing
a
man
in
cold
blood
for
this
assures
that
no
man
knows
whether
his
was
the
rifle
that
sped
the
living
soul
from
that
pitiful
cringing
body
in
the
past
the
germans
have
had
constant
trouble
with
the
natives
not
one
tribe
but
has
had
to
be
visited
by
sword
and
flame
and
wholesale
execution
that
this
is
not
entirely
the
fault
of
the
natives
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
we
have
not
experienced
in
east
africa
and
uganda
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
with
our
natives
notoriously
a
most
restless
and
warlike
combination
of
races
it
was
thought
at
one
time
that
if
the
germans
seriously
weakened
their
hold
on
some
of
the
more
troublesome
tribes
and
withdrew
garrisons
from
localities
where
troops
alone
had
kept
the
native
in
subjection
risings
of
a
terrible
and
embarrassing
character
would
be
the
result
that
such
fear
entered
also
into
the
german
mind
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
for
long
they
did
not
dare
to
withdraw
certain
administrative
officials
and
soldiers
of
the
regular
army
who
would
have
been
of
great
service
as
army
commanders
from
their
police
work
notably
is
this
the
case
at
songea
in
the
angle
between
lake
nyasa
and
the
portuguese
border
to
the
state
of
terror
among
the
german
women
owing
to
the
fear
of
a
native
rising
during
the
intervening
period
between
the
retreat
of
their
troops
and
the
arrival
of
our
own
in
morogoro
i
myself
can
testify
for
the
german
nursing
sisters
who
worked
with
me
told
of
the
flight
to
this
town
of
outlying
families
and
how
the
women
were
all
supplied
with
tablets
of
prussic
acid
to
swallow
if
the
dreadful
end
approached
for
death
from
the
swift
cyanide
would
be
gentler
far
than
at
the
hands
of
a
savage
native
but
the
germans
have
to
admit
that
as
they
showed
no
mercy
to
the
native
in
the
past
so
they
could
expect
none
at
such
a
time
as
this
they
told
me
of
the
glad
relief
with
which
they
welcomed
the
coming
of
our
troops
and
how
with
tears
of
gratitude
they
threw
swift
death
into
the
bushes
much
indeed
as
they
hated
the
humiliating
spectacle
of
the
gallant
rhodesians
and
baluchis
making
their
formal
entry
into
the
fair
streets
of
morogoro
the
german
hold
on
the
natives
is
owing
to
severe
repressive
measures
in
the
past
and
the
unrelaxing
discipline
of
the
present
war
most
effective
and
likely
to
remain
so
until
our
troops
appear
actually
among
them
indeed
the
fear
of
a
native
rising
and
the
butchery
of
german
women
and
children
has
been
ever
on
our
minds
and
we
have
had
to
impress
upon
the
native
that
we
desired
or
could
countenance
no
such
help
upon
their
part
all
we
asked
of
the
native
population
was
to
keep
the
peace
and
supply
us
with
information
food
and
porters
we
sent
word
among
the
restless
tribes
to
warn
them
to
keep
quiet
saying
that
if
the
germans
had
chastised
them
with
whips
we
would
indeed
chastise
them
with
scorpions
in
the
event
of
their
getting
out
of
hand
and
we
must
admit
that
almost
without
exception
the
natives
of
all
tribes
have
proved
most
welcoming
most
docile
and
most
grateful
for
our
arrival
had
it
not
been
for
the
clandestine
intrigues
of
the
german
planters
and
missionaries
whom
we
returned
to
their
homes
and
occupations
of
peace
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
but
the
hun
may
promise
faithfully
may
enter
into
the
most
solemn
obligations
not
to
take
active
or
passive
part
further
in
the
war
but
nevertheless
he
seems
unable
to
keep
himself
from
betraying
our
trust
such
a
born
spy
and
intriguer
is
he
that
he
can
not
refrain
from
intimidating
the
native
of
whose
quietness
he
is
now
assured
by
the
presence
of
our
troops
by
threats
of
what
will
befall
him
when
the
germans
return
if
he
the
native
so
much
as
sells
us
food
or
enters
our
employment
as
a
porter
but
the
native
is
extraordinarily
local
in
his
knowledge
his
world
bounded
for
him
by
the
borders
of
neighbouring
and
often
hostile
tribes
we
are
not
at
all
certain
that
any
but
coast
or
border
tribes
can
really
appreciate
the
difference
between
british
rule
and
the
domination
that
has
now
been
swept
away
recent
reports
on
all
sides
show
the
desire
for
peace
and
the
end
of
the
war
for
war
brings
in
its
train
forced
labour
the
requisition
of
food
and
the
curse
of
german
askaris
wandering
about
among
the
native
villages
satisfying
their
every
want
often
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
preferable
even
to
this
are
the
piping
times
of
peace
when
the
german
administrator
with
rare
exceptions
singularly
unhappy
in
his
dealing
with
the
chiefs
would
not
hesitate
to
thrash
a
chief
before
his
villagers
and
condemn
him
to
labour
in
neck
chains
on
the
roads
among
his
own
subjects
and
this
mark
you
for
the
failure
of
the
chief
to
keep
an
appointment
when
the
german
failed
to
appreciate
the
difference
in
the
natives
estimation
of
time
by
swahili
time
the
day
commences
at
in
the
past
it
was
no
wonder
that
chiefs
burning
with
a
sense
of
wrong
and
the
humiliation
they
had
suffered
preferred
to
raise
their
tribe
and
perish
by
the
sword
than
endure
a
life
that
bore
such
indignity
and
shame
but
our
job
has
not
been
rendered
any
easier
by
the
difficulty
we
have
experienced
in
pacifying
the
simple
blacks
by
attempts
to
dispel
the
fears
of
rapine
and
murder
at
the
hands
of
our
soldiers
with
which
the
germans
have
been
at
such
pains
to
saturate
the
native
mind
this
in
conjunction
with
the
suspicion
which
the
native
of
german
east
africa
has
for
any
european
and
more
especially
his
horror
of
war
has
made
us
prepared
to
see
the
native
bolt
at
our
approach
but
if
our
task
has
succeeded
there
has
been
striking
ill
success
on
the
part
of
the
germans
in
organising
and
inducing
in
spite
of
their
many
attempts
and
the
obvious
danger
to
their
own
women
and
children
these
native
tribes
to
oppose
our
advance
fortunately
for
us
and
for
the
white
women
of
the
country
tribes
will
not
easily
combine
and
are
loath
to
leave
their
tribal
territory
many
of
us
have
looked
with
some
concern
upon
the
mere
possibility
of
this
german
colony
being
returned
to
its
former
owners
we
must
remember
that
we
shall
inevitably
lose
the
measure
of
respect
the
native
holds
for
us
if
we
contemplate
giving
back
this
province
once
more
to
german
ruling
prestige
alone
is
the
factor
in
the
future
that
will
keep
order
among
these
savage
races
who
have
now
learnt
to
use
the
rifle
and
and
have
money
in
plenty
to
provide
themselves
with
ammunition
the
war
has
done
much
to
destroy
the
prestige
that
allows
a
white
man
to
dominate
thousands
of
the
natives
for
to
the
indigenous
inhabitants
of
the
country
the
white
man
ways
are
inexplicable
they
can
not
conceive
a
war
conducted
with
such
alternate
savagery
and
chivalry
to
those
who
look
upon
the
women
of
the
vanquished
as
the
victors
special
prize
the
immunity
from
outrage
that
german
women
enjoy
is
beyond
their
comprehension
for
that
reason
we
shall
welcome
the
day
when
an
official
announcement
is
made
that
the
british
government
have
taken
over
the
country
one
would
like
to
see
big
indabas
held
at
every
town
and
centre
in
the
country
formal
raising
of
the
union
jack
cannon
salutes
bands
playing
and
parades
of
soldiers
good
for
evil
when
the
rains
had
finished
by
may
in
the
belgian
congo
general
molitor
began
to
move
upon
tanganyika
soon
our
flotilla
and
the
belgian
launches
and
seaplanes
had
swept
the
lake
of
german
shipping
and
the
first
belgian
force
landed
and
occupied
ujiji
the
terminus
of
the
central
railway
then
the
blood
of
the
huns
in
africa
ran
cold
in
their
veins
and
the
fear
that
the
advancing
belgians
would
wreak
vengeance
for
the
crimes
of
germany
in
belgium
and
to
the
belgian
consuls
in
prison
in
tabora
gripped
their
vitals
hastily
they
sent
their
women
and
children
at
all
speed
east
along
the
line
to
tabora
the
new
provincial
capital
and
planned
to
put
up
the
stiff
rearguard
actions
that
should
delay
the
enemy
until
the
english
might
take
tabora
and
save
their
women
from
belgian
hands
for
the
english
those
fools
who
had
already
so
well
treated
the
women
at
wilhelmstal
could
be
as
easily
persuaded
to
exercise
their
flabby
sentimentalism
on
the
women
and
children
in
tabora
so
ran
the
german
reasoning
slowly
and
relentlessly
the
belgian
columns
swept
eastward
along
the
railway
line
closely
with
the
british
force
advancing
from
mwanza
toward
the
capital
but
in
molitor
the
german
general
wable
had
met
more
than
his
match
and
soon
outgeneralled
and
he
had
to
rally
on
the
last
prepared
position
west
of
tabora
then
daily
went
the
german
parlementaires
under
the
white
flag
that
standard
the
enemy
know
so
well
how
to
use
to
the
british
general
praying
that
he
would
occupy
tabora
while
wable
kept
the
belgians
in
check
but
the
british
general
was
adamant
and
would
have
none
of
it
and
as
wable
shattered
forces
fled
to
the
bush
to
march
to
where
lettow
the
was
keeping
watch
the
belgians
entered
the
fair
city
of
tabora
and
here
were
over
five
hundred
german
women
and
children
clinging
to
the
protection
that
the
governor
wife
should
gain
for
them
for
frau
von
schnee
was
a
new
zealand
woman
and
she
might
be
looked
to
to
persuade
the
british
to
restrain
the
belgian
askari
but
there
was
no
need
the
behaviour
of
belgian
officers
and
their
native
soldiers
was
as
correct
and
gentlemanly
as
that
of
officers
should
be
and
to
their
relief
and
surprise
those
white
women
found
the
tables
turned
and
that
their
enemy
could
be
as
chivalrous
to
them
as
german
soldiers
their
own
brothers
had
been
vile
to
the
wretched
people
of
belgium
there
was
no
nonsense
about
the
belgian
general
stern
and
just
but
very
strict
he
brought
the
german
population
to
heel
and
kept
them
there
cap
in
hand
the
german
men
came
to
him
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
work
for
the
conqueror
their
carpenters
shops
the
blacksmiths
forges
were
at
the
service
of
the
high
commander
no
german
on
the
footpaths
hats
raised
from
obsequious
teuton
heads
whenever
a
belgian
officer
passes
how
the
chivalry
of
belgium
heaped
coals
of
fire
upon
the
german
heads
and
had
the
hun
been
of
such
a
fibre
as
to
appreciate
the
lesson
of
what
great
value
we
might
hope
that
it
would
be
but
decent
treatment
never
did
appeal
to
the
german
he
always
held
that
clemency
spelt
weakness
and
the
fear
of
the
avenging
german
michael
for
did
not
the
emperor
eagle
now
float
over
paris
and
petersburg
that
he
knew
well
for
had
not
high
headquarters
told
him
of
the
message
from
the
kaiser
by
wireless
from
nauen
the
message
that
conveyed
to
lettow
himself
the
iron
cross
decoration
the
governor
wife
was
allowed
to
retain
her
palace
and
servants
but
all
german
women
were
kept
strictly
to
their
houses
after
six
at
night
no
looting
no
riots
no
disturbance
and
german
women
began
to
be
piqued
at
the
calm
indifference
of
smart
belgian
officers
to
the
favours
they
might
have
had
openly
chagrined
were
the
local
hun
beauties
at
such
a
disregard
of
their
charms
i
fear
for
our
women
and
children
in
tabora
said
the
german
doctor
to
me
in
morogoro
ach
what
will
the
belgians
do
when
they
hear
the
tales
that
are
told
of
our
german
troops
in
belgium
you
do
believe
these
stories
of
german
brutalities
do
you
he
said
anxiously
conciliatory
but
i
did
and
i
told
him
so
but
you
do
know
the
belgian
askari
he
is
cannibal
he
is
recruited
from
the
pagan
tribes
in
the
forest
of
the
congo
he
files
his
front
teeth
to
a
point
and
we
know
he
is
short
of
supplies
what
is
going
to
happen
to
german
children
it
is
the
truth
i
tell
you
he
went
on
evidently
with
very
sincere
feeling
you
know
what
became
of
the
kavirondo
porters
your
government
lent
to
the
belgian
general
where
are
our
prisoners
that
the
belgians
took
in
ujiji
and
along
the
line
eaten
all
eaten
and
he
threw
up
his
hands
tragically
to
heaven
i
know
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
swear
to
you
that
rumpel
story
is
true
rumpel
was
lettow
best
intelligence
agent
our
scout
was
a
prisoner
with
a
company
of
belgian
askaris
you
know
and
it
was
only
that
the
belgian
company
commander
wanted
to
get
information
from
him
that
he
was
not
eaten
at
once
have
you
heard
the
tale
that
rumpel
tells
after
his
escape
how
the
senior
native
officer
came
to
his
belgian
commander
and
complained
that
they
had
no
food
the
villages
were
empty
not
so
much
as
an
egg
or
chicken
to
be
got
irritably
the
belgian
officer
shouted
that
the
soldiers
knew
that
no
one
had
food
and
they
must
wait
till
they
got
to
the
next
post
on
the
morrow
urged
the
native
sergeant
softly
are
the
prisoners
the
prisoners
said
the
belgian
officer
relieved
by
an
easy
way
out
of
a
very
difficult
situation
not
more
than
sixteen
remember
that
and
the
sergeant
went
away
this
and
countless
other
lies
did
the
germans
tell
us
of
our
belgian
allies
but
how
different
the
truth
when
it
reached
us
at
last
along
the
railway
by
our
troops
that
came
from
the
northern
column
to
join
us
at
morogoro
not
a
german
woman
insulted
not
one
fat
german
child
missing
no
occupied
house
even
entered
by
the
belgian
troops
not
so
much
as
a
chicken
stolen
from
a
german
compound
so
just
so
completely
impartial
was
general
molitor
that
he
applied
to
german
prisoners
in
territory
then
occupied
by
him
the
very
rules
and
regulations
that
the
german
command
had
laid
down
for
the
governing
of
english
and
belgian
and
other
allied
prisoners
only
the
vile
the
unspeakable
regulations
and
every
ordinance
in
that
printed
list
of
german
rules
that
destroyed
the
prestige
of
the
white
man
in
the
native
eyes
did
he
omit
if
the
germans
were
indifferent
to
this
one
elementary
rule
of
the
white
race
in
equatorial
africa
the
white
law
that
no
white
man
be
degraded
before
a
native
then
the
belgian
would
show
the
hun
how
to
play
the
game
we
must
hack
our
way
through
said
and
we
in
morogoro
were
very
curious
to
see
what
manner
of
vengeance
the
belgians
might
wreak
nor
would
we
have
blamed
them
for
anything
they
might
have
done
i
had
lived
in
german
prisons
with
elderly
belgian
officers
whose
wives
and
daughters
had
been
left
behind
in
occupied
parts
of
belgium
we
all
had
shuddered
at
the
stories
they
told
us
nor
did
we
wonder
that
these
unhappy
fathers
had
often
gone
insane
and
when
we
learnt
the
truth
about
tabora
and
knew
too
to
our
disgust
that
such
clemency
was
attributed
to
belgian
fear
of
the
avenging
german
michael
and
not
to
natural
belgian
chivalry
we
were
furious
what
can
one
do
with
such
a
people
the
mechanical
transport
a
cloud
of
red
dust
along
a
rough
bush
track
a
rattling
jar
approaching
and
the
donkey
transport
pulls
into
the
bushes
to
let
the
juggernaut
of
the
road
go
by
swaying
and
plunging
over
the
rough
ground
lurches
one
of
our
huge
motor
lorries
perched
high
up
upon
the
seat
face
and
arms
burnt
dark
brown
by
the
tropical
sun
is
the
driver
stern
faced
and
intent
upon
the
road
he
slews
his
big
ship
into
a
better
bit
of
road
by
hauling
at
the
steering
wheel
beside
him
on
the
seat
the
second
driver
ready
to
their
hands
the
rifles
that
may
save
their
precious
cargo
from
the
marauding
german
patrol
which
lies
hidden
in
the
thick
bush
beside
the
road
in
the
big
body
of
the
car
behind
are
two
thousand
pounds
of
rations
and
atop
of
all
a
smiling
tota
the
small
native
boy
these
drivers
employ
to
light
their
fires
and
cook
their
food
at
night
and
this
load
is
food
for
a
whole
brigade
alone
for
half
a
day
so
you
may
see
how
necessary
it
is
that
this
valuable
cargo
arrives
in
time
it
may
sound
to
you
in
sheltered
london
a
pleasant
and
agreeable
thing
to
drive
through
this
strange
new
country
full
of
the
wild
game
that
glimpses
of
zoological
gardens
in
the
past
suggest
a
zoo
without
a
blooming
keeper
but
there
is
no
department
of
war
that
does
such
hard
work
as
these
lorry
drivers
for
them
no
rest
in
the
day
that
is
deemed
a
lucky
one
if
it
provides
them
only
with
sixteen
hours
work
the
infantry
of
the
line
have
their
periodical
rests
a
month
it
may
be
of
comparative
leisure
before
the
enemy
trenches
but
for
mechanical
transport
there
is
no
peace
save
such
as
comes
when
back
axles
break
and
the
big
land
ship
is
dragged
into
the
bush
to
be
repaired
hot
and
sweating
men
striving
to
renew
some
part
or
improvise
by
bullock
hide
reims
a
temporary
road
repair
that
will
bring
them
limping
back
to
the
advance
base
here
the
company
workshop
waits
to
repair
these
derelicts
of
the
road
burning
with
malaria
when
the
hot
sun
draws
the
lurking
fever
from
their
bones
tortured
with
dysentery
they
got
to
do
their
job
until
they
reach
their
lorry
park
again
but
often
the
repair
gang
can
not
reach
a
stranded
lorry
and
the
drivers
helpless
before
a
big
mechanical
repair
have
to
camp
out
alongside
their
car
till
help
arrives
and
tows
them
in
a
tarpaulin
rigged
up
along
one
side
of
the
lorry
poles
cut
from
the
thorn
bush
and
they
have
protection
from
the
burning
sun
by
day
a
thorn
hedge
the
native
boma
keeps
out
lions
and
the
sneaking
hyaena
at
night
nor
are
their
rifles
more
than
a
half
protection
for
the
makes
so
clean
a
hole
that
it
is
often
madness
to
attempt
to
shoot
a
lion
with
it
once
wounded
he
is
far
more
dangerous
a
foe
here
the
tota
earns
his
pay
for
he
can
hunt
the
native
villages
for
cuckoos
the
native
fowls
and
eggs
the
load
of
rations
must
not
save
at
the
last
extremity
be
broached
and
the
roads
they
travel
on
you
never
saw
such
things
mere
bush
tracks
where
the
pioneers
have
cut
down
trees
and
bushes
and
left
the
stumps
above
the
level
earth
no
easy
job
to
steer
these
great
lumbering
machines
between
these
treacherous
stumps
from
early
dawn
to
late
night
you
meet
these
leviathans
of
the
road
diving
into
the
bush
to
force
a
new
road
for
themselves
when
the
old
track
is
too
deep
in
mud
or
dust
plunging
and
diving
down
or
the
rocky
creeping
with
great
care
over
the
frail
bridge
that
spans
a
deep
ravine
a
bridge
made
up
of
laid
lengthwise
on
wooden
the
lion
and
the
leopard
stand
beside
the
road
with
paw
uplifted
in
the
glare
of
the
headlights
at
night
nor
is
there
only
danger
from
flood
and
fever
and
the
denizens
of
the
forest
there
is
ever
to
be
feared
the
lurking
german
patrol
that
trains
its
dozen
rifles
upon
the
driver
knowing
full
well
that
he
must
sit
and
quietly
face
it
out
or
the
lorry
once
out
of
control
plunges
against
a
tree
and
becomes
with
both
its
drivers
the
prey
of
these
marauders
so
while
his
mate
fumbles
with
the
bolt
lever
of
his
rifle
the
driver
takes
a
firmer
grip
of
the
wheel
gives
her
more
juice
and
plunges
headlong
down
the
road
at
handeni
i
once
had
a
driver
with
five
bullets
in
him
they
had
not
stopped
him
until
he
reached
safety
and
his
mate
was
able
to
take
over
nor
does
this
exhaust
the
risks
of
his
job
for
there
is
the
land
mine
buried
in
the
soft
dust
of
the
road
or
beneath
the
crazy
bridge
laid
at
night
by
the
patrol
that
harasses
our
lines
of
communication
they
are
the
special
danger
of
the
first
convoy
to
come
along
the
road
in
the
morning
troops
we
have
not
to
spare
to
guard
these
long
lines
of
ours
so
in
particularly
dangerous
places
the
driver
carries
a
small
guard
of
soldiers
on
the
top
of
his
freight
behind
him
native
patrols
very
wise
at
noticing
any
derangement
of
the
surface
dust
patrol
the
highways
at
dawn
to
lift
these
unwelcome
souvenirs
from
the
roads
from
south
africa
from
home
and
from
canada
come
the
drivers
and
mechanics
of
the
motor
transport
the
canadians
stout
fellows
from
toronto
winnipeg
and
the
far
west
enlisted
in
the
british
in
canada
and
arrived
in
england
only
to
be
sent
to
east
africa
it
seems
at
first
sight
a
strange
country
to
which
to
send
these
men
from
the
north
but
in
fact
it
was
a
very
happy
choice
for
they
got
away
from
the
cold
dampness
of
england
and
flanders
into
the
summer
seas
of
the
south
atlantic
where
the
flying
fish
and
rainbow
nautilus
filled
them
with
surprise
cape
town
and
durban
must
have
been
for
these
canadian
lads
a
new
world
only
previously
envisaged
by
them
in
the
big
map
that
hangs
on
the
walls
of
canadian
schools
a
little
difficult
at
first
apt
to
chafe
at
the
restrictions
that
though
perhaps
not
necessary
for
themselves
in
particular
were
yet
essential
in
preserving
discipline
in
the
whole
mixed
unit
rather
inclined
to
resent
certain
phases
of
soldier
life
but
soon
they
settled
down
to
do
their
job
to
take
trouble
over
their
work
rather
than
make
trouble
by
grousing
over
it
well
they
proved
their
worth
by
the
number
that
now
fill
the
ranks
and
may
be
judged
by
the
commendation
of
their
commanding
officers
i
used
to
think
that
they
came
to
see
me
in
particular
at
the
long
sick
parades
i
held
in
morogoro
and
handeni
because
i
too
lived
like
some
of
them
in
british
columbia
i
can
not
flatter
my
soul
by
thinking
that
they
came
for
the
special
quality
of
the
quinine
or
medical
advice
i
dished
out
to
them
it
may
have
been
that
they
were
far
from
home
and
i
seemed
a
friend
in
a
very
strange
land
all
i
know
is
that
i
felt
a
great
compliment
was
paid
to
me
that
they
should
be
grateful
for
the
often
hurried
and
small
attentions
that
i
could
give
them
they
would
sometimes
bring
me
canadian
papers
that
took
me
back
two
and
a
half
years
to
the
time
when
i
came
to
england
on
a
six
weeks
holiday
from
my
work
a
holiday
that
has
now
spun
out
to
three
and
a
half
years
and
shows
every
sign
of
going
further
still
very
well
these
men
stood
the
climate
in
spite
of
their
fair
colouring
in
a
country
that
penalises
the
blonde
races
more
than
the
brown
that
makes
us
pay
for
our
want
of
protective
pigment
one
stout
fellow
i
well
remember
who
had
acute
appendicitis
at
morogoro
was
the
driver
or
engineer
as
they
are
called
of
a
grand
trunk
pacific
train
that
ran
from
edmonton
in
alberta
to
prince
rupert
on
the
pacific
we
operated
upon
him
and
though
he
did
very
well
yet
he
must
have
suffered
many
things
from
our
want
of
nursing
in
his
convalescence
very
considerate
and
uncomplaining
he
was
like
all
the
good
fellows
in
our
hospital
giving
no
trouble
and
making
every
allowance
for
our
difficulties
in
fact
the
great
trouble
one
has
among
soldiers
is
to
get
them
to
make
any
complaint
to
their
own
medical
officer
if
one
suggests
things
to
them
or
asks
them
leading
questions
they
will
sometimes
admit
to
certain
deficiencies
in
food
or
treatment
by
the
orderlies
but
of
what
one
did
oneself
or
what
the
german
sister
left
undone
there
was
never
a
complaint
to
me
though
i
rather
think
there
were
many
grouses
when
once
they
left
the
hospital
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
not
that
they
know
better
or
that
they
did
know
that
certain
things
were
wrong
for
it
is
a
very
intelligent
army
this
of
ours
and
has
been
in
hospital
before
in
civil
life
but
all
along
i
felt
that
they
did
not
like
to
hurt
one
feelings
by
not
getting
well
as
quickly
as
they
might
and
that
they
often
pretended
to
a
degree
of
comfort
and
ease
from
pain
that
i
sure
was
not
the
fact
but
this
phase
is
often
met
with
in
civil
life
too
a
doctor
has
much
to
be
grateful
for
that
many
of
his
patients
insist
on
getting
well
or
saying
that
they
are
better
just
to
please
him
the
german
surgical
sister
was
always
kind
to
our
men
and
when
the
serious
state
of
the
wound
was
past
she
would
do
the
dressings
herself
while
i
went
about
some
other
work
our
men
liked
her
and
i
remember
that
our
canadian
engine
driver
offered
her
in
his
kindly
way
to
give
her
a
free
pass
on
the
grand
trunk
railway
he
little
knew
that
this
german
sister
represented
no
small
part
of
two
big
german
shipping
companies
that
could
once
have
provided
her
with
free
passes
over
any
railway
in
the
world
i
had
under
me
too
a
couple
of
canadian
drivers
whose
lorry
in
crossing
one
of
the
ramshackle
bridges
over
a
river
hit
the
railing
on
the
side
and
plunged
to
the
rocky
depths
below
a
loose
that
formed
the
roadbed
of
the
bridge
had
jerked
the
steering
wheel
from
the
driver
hands
over
went
the
lorry
on
top
of
them
and
the
mercy
of
providence
only
interposed
a
big
rock
that
left
room
below
for
the
two
drivers
to
escape
the
crushing
that
would
have
killed
them
badly
bruised
only
they
left
me
later
to
recover
of
their
contusion
in
the
hospital
at
the
surgery
of
this
war
please
give
us
a
drop
of
johnnie
walker
before
you
do
my
dressing
said
my
irish
sergeant
who
had
lost
his
leg
in
the
fight
at
kangata
lest
you
might
think
that
by
johnnie
walker
he
asked
for
his
favourite
brand
of
whiskey
i
may
tell
you
that
we
had
no
stimulant
of
that
kind
with
us
it
was
chloroform
he
wanted
to
dull
the
pain
that
dressing
his
severed
nerves
entailed
always
full
of
cheer
and
blarney
he
kept
our
ward
alive
only
when
the
time
for
daily
dressing
came
round
did
his
countenance
fall
then
anxious
eyes
begged
for
ease
from
pain
but
this
once
over
he
laid
his
tired
dirty
face
upon
the
embroidered
pillow
and
jested
of
all
the
things
the
careful
german
housewife
would
say
could
she
but
see
her
embroidered
sheets
and
the
blue
silk
cushion
from
her
that
kept
his
amputated
leg
from
jars
we
had
no
water
to
wash
the
men
barely
enough
for
cooking
and
for
surgical
dressings
but
there
were
silk
bedspreads
and
eiderdown
quilts
and
all
the
treasures
of
german
and
the
fact
that
they
were
taken
from
the
germans
was
balm
to
these
wounded
men
there
was
murray
a
regimental
his
leg
badly
broken
by
the
lead
slug
from
a
german
askari
rifle
ever
the
at
the
padre
services
chanting
the
responses
and
leading
all
the
hymns
and
wehmeyer
the
young
boer
who
had
accidentally
blown
a
great
hole
through
his
leg
above
the
ankle
joint
and
green
the
rhodesian
sergeant
who
had
been
brought
in
almost
with
blackwater
nor
was
his
condition
improved
by
the
experience
of
having
been
blown
up
in
the
ambulance
by
a
land
mine
hidden
in
the
thick
dust
of
the
road
thrown
into
the
air
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
the
car
had
turned
over
on
him
and
the
driver
who
was
killed
and
there
was
becker
the
german
prisoner
with
a
bullet
through
his
femoral
artery
and
his
hip
blanched
from
loss
of
blood
before
i
could
tie
the
vessel
and
stanch
the
bleeding
his
leg
suspended
in
our
improvised
splints
and
on
his
way
to
make
a
splendid
recovery
and
taube
another
german
prisoner
shot
through
the
abdomen
and
recovering
after
his
operation
gentle
and
conciliatory
with
eyes
of
a
frightened
rabbit
he
was
the
son
of
the
great
taube
the
physiologist
of
dresden
cheek
by
jowl
in
the
best
bed
was
zahn
the
hated
loathed
by
his
own
men
one
of
whom
wrote
in
his
diary
that
he
loved
to
see
the
bombardment
of
tanga
for
zahn
was
there
the
and
i
hope
he
meet
a
shell
jealous
of
his
officer
prerogative
and
disinclined
to
be
nursed
in
the
same
ward
with
our
soldiers
and
his
own
he
gave
a
lot
of
trouble
demanding
inordinately
victimising
our
orderly
unashamedly
selfish
but
he
was
sheltered
from
my
wrath
by
the
grave
gunshot
wound
of
his
thigh
cowardly
under
suffering
he
was
in
striking
contrast
to
becker
who
stood
graver
pain
with
hardly
a
flinch
after
a
great
struggle
he
was
eventually
moved
to
korogwe
to
the
stationary
hospital
there
it
became
necessary
to
amputate
his
leg
and
zahn
surrendered
what
little
courage
he
had
left
no
leg
no
zahn
he
said
to
his
nurse
and
he
was
right
for
at
eleven
that
night
he
had
no
leg
and
at
two
the
next
morning
there
was
no
zahn
upon
this
earth
and
there
was
sergeant
eve
of
the
south
african
infantry
who
got
a
a
londoner
and
of
unquenchable
good
humour
vastly
pleased
with
the
daily
bottle
of
stout
we
got
for
him
with
such
difficulty
from
supplies
he
faced
the
awful
daily
dressing
of
his
shattered
leg
without
flinching
pretending
to
great
comfort
and
an
excellent
position
of
his
splint
which
his
crooked
leg
and
my
practised
eye
belied
and
there
was
smith
yet
a
boy
but
who
always
felt
champion
and
quite
comfortable
though
his
days
were
few
in
the
land
and
his
pain
must
have
been
very
severe
yet
in
his
case
he
had
days
of
that
merciful
euthanasia
the
wonderful
ease
from
pain
that
sometimes
lasts
for
days
before
the
end
in
great
contrast
with
these
was
an
individual
with
a
wound
through
the
fleshy
part
of
the
thigh
by
far
the
least
seriously
wounded
of
all
in
the
ward
who
never
failed
with
his
unending
requests
to
the
patient
orderlies
and
his
eternal
complainings
until
a
public
from
me
brought
him
to
heel
and
glover
who
wept
that
i
had
lost
his
bullet
that
unforgivable
carelessness
in
a
surgeon
that
allows
a
bullet
removed
at
an
operation
to
be
thrown
away
with
discarded
dressings
but
of
all
the
perfect
prince
was
de
la
motte
a
subaltern
in
the
punjabis
ever
the
leader
of
the
dangerous
patrols
along
the
native
bush
paths
that
give
themselves
so
readily
to
ambush
shot
through
the
spine
and
paralysed
below
the
waist
his
life
was
only
a
question
of
months
but
if
he
had
little
time
to
live
he
had
determined
to
see
it
through
with
a
gay
courage
that
was
wonderful
to
see
previously
wounded
in
france
he
yet
seemed
though
he
can
not
possibly
have
been
in
ignorance
to
be
buoyed
up
with
the
perfect
faith
in
recovery
with
which
fractured
spines
so
often
are
endowed
never
asking
me
awkward
questions
he
made
it
so
easy
for
me
to
do
his
daily
dressing
so
grateful
for
small
attentions
and
so
ready
to
believe
me
when
i
told
him
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
weeks
before
he
would
be
home
again
and
in
spite
of
all
fears
i
have
just
heard
he
did
get
home
to
see
his
people
and
by
his
cheerful
courage
to
rob
death
of
all
his
terrors
my
operating
theatre
at
handeni
up
the
wide
stone
steps
under
the
arch
of
purple
bougainvillea
and
you
are
in
my
operating
theatre
a
curtain
of
mosquito
gauze
screens
it
from
the
vulgar
gaze
behind
these
big
wooden
doors
a
week
ago
was
the
office
of
this
erstwhile
german
jail
to
the
left
and
right
now
all
clean
and
white
painted
were
the
living
rooms
of
the
german
jailor
and
his
wife
but
for
the
present
they
are
transformed
into
special
wards
for
severely
wounded
men
on
the
wall
and
very
carefully
preserved
is
strafe
which
the
late
occupants
wrote
in
charcoal
as
they
fled
strange
how
all
german
curses
come
home
to
roost
and
move
us
to
the
ridicule
that
hurts
the
hun
so
much
and
so
surely
penetrates
his
pachydermatous
hide
that
the
hymn
of
hate
should
be
with
us
a
cause
for
jest
and
strafe
be
adopted
with
enthusiasm
into
the
english
language
he
can
not
understand
to
him
as
often
to
our
own
selves
we
shall
always
be
incomprehensible
through
the
gauze
screen
on
to
the
white
operating
table
passed
all
the
flotsam
of
wounded
humanity
in
the
summer
months
all
the
human
wreckage
that
marked
the
savage
bush
fighting
from
german
bridge
to
morogoro
came
to
me
upon
this
table
and
its
white
cleanness
our
towels
and
surgical
gloves
and
overalls
filled
them
with
a
sense
of
comfort
and
of
safety
after
weary
and
perilous
journeys
that
was
in
no
way
detracted
from
by
the
gleaming
instruments
laid
out
beside
the
table
even
this
chamber
of
pain
was
a
haven
of
refuge
to
these
broken
men
after
long
jolting
rides
over
execrable
roads
but
a
particularist
among
surgeons
would
have
found
much
to
disapprove
of
in
this
room
cracks
in
the
stone
floor
let
in
migrating
bands
of
red
ants
that
no
disinfectant
would
drive
away
arrow
slit
windows
high
up
in
the
walls
gave
ingress
to
the
african
swallow
redheaded
and
whose
tuneful
song
was
a
perpetual
delight
his
nests
adorned
the
frieze
but
they
were
full
of
squeaking
youngsters
and
we
could
not
shut
the
parents
out
so
we
banished
them
during
operating
hours
by
screens
of
mosquito
gauze
and
to
reward
us
they
sang
to
our
bedridden
men
from
ward
but
despite
these
shortcomings
of
the
operating
theatre
itself
we
did
good
work
here
and
got
splendid
results
for
god
was
good
and
the
clean
soil
took
pity
upon
our
many
deficiencies
earth
that
in
france
or
gallipoli
hid
the
germs
of
gangrene
and
tetanus
here
merely
produced
a
mild
infection
lucky
for
us
that
we
did
not
need
to
inject
the
wounded
with
tetanus
antitoxin
but
an
added
charm
was
given
to
our
work
by
the
necessity
of
improvisation
broken
legs
were
put
up
in
plaster
casings
with
metal
interruptions
so
that
the
painful
limb
might
be
at
rest
and
yet
the
wound
be
free
for
daily
dressings
the
huns
left
us
plaster
of
paris
damp
indeed
but
still
serviceable
after
drying
the
corrugated
iron
roofing
of
the
native
jail
provided
us
with
the
necessary
metal
then
by
metal
hoops
the
leg
was
slung
from
cradles
and
i
defy
the
most
modern
hospital
to
show
me
anything
more
comfortable
or
efficient
broken
thighs
were
suspended
in
slings
from
poles
above
the
bed
painted
the
red
white
and
black
that
marked
german
government
survey
posts
naturally
in
a
field
hospital
such
as
this
we
had
no
nurses
but
our
orderlies
torn
from
mine
shafts
of
dumfriesshire
and
the
engine
sheds
of
the
north
british
railway
did
their
best
and
compensated
by
much
kindliness
for
their
lack
of
nursing
training
sadly
in
need
were
we
of
trained
nurses
for
the
bedsores
that
developed
in
the
night
were
a
perpetual
terror
ring
pillows
we
made
out
of
grass
and
bandages
but
a
fractured
thigh
as
you
know
must
lie
upon
his
back
and
we
had
little
enough
rectified
spirit
to
harden
the
complaining
flesh
but
nurses
we
could
not
have
at
so
advanced
a
post
as
this
the
saving
factor
of
all
our
work
lay
in
the
natural
goodness
of
the
men
they
felt
that
many
things
were
not
right
for
ours
is
a
highly
intelligent
army
and
knows
more
of
medicine
and
surgery
than
we
in
our
blindness
realise
but
they
made
light
of
their
troubles
as
they
learnt
the
difficulties
we
laboured
with
so
grateful
were
they
for
small
attentions
that
we
should
go
out
of
our
way
to
take
pains
to
obtain
embroidered
sheets
and
pillows
absolved
us
in
their
eyes
from
all
the
want
of
surgical
nursing
liberal
morphia
we
had
to
give
to
compensate
for
nursing
defects
i
have
long
felt
that
i
would
rather
work
for
sick
soldiers
than
for
any
class
of
humanity
and
in
fifteen
years
i
have
come
to
know
the
sick
human
animal
in
all
his
forms
so
that
the
least
that
one
could
do
was
to
scheme
to
get
the
precious
egg
by
private
barter
with
the
natives
and
to
find
the
silk
pillow
that
spelt
comfort
but
was
the
anathema
of
asepsis
no
wonder
that
such
splendid
and
uncomplaining
victims
spurred
us
to
our
best
endeavours
and
made
of
toil
a
very
joy
some
african
diseases
this
is
the
season
of
blackwater
fever
the
pestilence
that
stalks
in
the
noontide
and
the
terror
of
tropical
campaigning
hitherto
with
the
exception
of
the
rhodesians
who
have
had
this
disease
previously
in
their
northern
territory
or
men
who
have
come
from
the
congo
or
the
shores
of
the
great
lakes
our
army
has
been
fairly
free
from
this
dread
visitation
the
campaigning
area
of
the
coast
and
the
railway
line
of
british
east
africa
that
gave
our
men
malaria
in
plenty
during
the
first
two
years
of
war
had
not
provided
many
of
those
focal
areas
in
which
this
disease
is
distributed
the
loyal
north
lancashires
and
the
royal
fusiliers
had
been
but
little
affected
the
usambara
valley
along
the
railway
was
also
fairly
free
on
the
big
trek
from
kilimanjaro
to
morogoro
the
blackwater
cases
were
almost
entirely
confined
to
rhodesians
and
to
the
kashmiris
who
suffer
in
this
way
in
their
native
mountains
of
nepal
but
once
we
struck
the
central
railway
and
penetrated
south
towards
the
delta
of
the
rufigi
the
tale
was
different
british
and
south
african
troops
began
to
arrive
in
the
grip
of
this
fell
malady
it
was
written
on
their
faces
as
they
were
lifted
from
ambulance
or
mule
waggon
there
was
no
need
to
seek
the
cause
in
the
scrap
of
paper
that
was
the
sick
report
all
who
ran
could
read
it
in
the
blanched
lips
the
pallor
of
their
faces
the
jaundiced
eye
the
hurried
breathing
thereupon
came
three
struggle
with
azrael
pale
shape
before
the
blackwater
gave
place
to
the
natural
colour
again
or
until
the
secreting
mechanism
gave
up
the
contest
altogether
and
the
destroying
angel
settled
firmly
on
his
prey
at
first
if
there
was
no
vomiting
it
was
easy
to
ply
the
hourly
drinks
of
tea
and
water
and
medicine
but
once
deadly
and
exhausting
vomiting
had
begun
one
could
no
longer
feed
the
victim
by
the
mouth
then
came
the
keener
struggle
for
life
for
fluid
was
essential
and
had
to
be
given
by
other
ways
and
means
into
the
soft
folds
of
the
skin
of
the
breast
and
flanks
we
ran
in
salt
solution
by
the
pint
the
veins
of
the
arms
we
brought
into
service
that
we
might
pour
in
this
vitalising
fluid
day
and
night
the
fight
goes
on
for
three
days
until
it
is
won
or
lost
here
again
as
in
tick
fever
we
use
the
preparation
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
the
great
ehrlich
champagne
is
a
great
so
well
recognised
is
the
latter
remedy
that
all
old
hands
at
tropical
travel
take
with
them
a
case
of
bubbly
water
for
such
occasions
as
these
blessed
morphia
too
brings
ease
of
vomiting
and
is
a
priceless
boon
you
ask
me
the
cause
of
this
disease
and
i
have
to
admit
that
among
the
authorities
themselves
there
are
no
settled
convictions
some
hold
and
for
my
part
i
am
with
them
that
the
attack
is
caused
by
quinine
given
in
too
large
a
dose
to
a
subject
who
is
rotten
with
malaria
but
there
are
others
who
maintain
that
it
is
a
malarial
manifestation
only
and
that
the
big
dose
of
quinine
which
seems
to
some
to
precipitate
the
attack
is
only
a
coincidence
be
that
as
it
may
there
is
little
difference
in
the
treatment
adopted
by
either
school
death
achieves
his
victory
as
frequently
with
one
as
with
another
certain
it
is
that
to
the
common
mind
quinine
is
the
reputed
cause
and
is
avoided
in
large
doses
by
men
who
have
once
had
blackwater
or
who
are
in
that
low
rotten
state
that
predisposes
to
it
in
one
point
all
agree
that
one
must
be
saturated
with
malaria
before
blackwater
can
develop
so
great
is
the
aversion
shown
by
some
men
to
the
big
doses
of
quinine
as
laid
down
by
regulations
that
men
have
often
refused
to
take
their
quinine
others
too
who
have
protested
at
first
take
their
quinine
ration
only
to
find
themselves
in
the
grip
of
this
disease
within
twelve
hours
such
a
case
was
a
frenchman
named
canarie
and
the
colour
of
his
face
upon
admission
did
not
belie
his
name
who
had
been
treated
for
blackwater
fever
by
the
great
koch
in
uganda
many
years
before
and
had
been
warned
by
him
against
big
doses
of
quinine
that
evening
he
was
on
my
hands
fortunately
soon
to
recover
and
to
win
a
prolonged
convalescent
leave
out
of
this
rain
to
the
sunny
and
slopes
of
wynberg
seldom
do
the
rumbling
ambulances
roll
in
but
among
their
human
freight
is
some
poor
wretch
snoring
into
unconsciousness
or
in
the
throes
of
epileptiform
convulsions
custom
has
sharpened
our
clinical
instinct
and
where
in
civil
life
we
would
look
for
meningitis
now
we
only
write
cerebral
malaria
and
search
the
senseless
soldier
for
the
name
that
we
may
put
upon
the
dangerous
list
as
this
name
is
flashed
miles
to
england
i
sometimes
wonder
what
conception
of
malaria
his
anxious
relatives
can
have
for
there
is
no
aspect
of
brain
diseases
that
cerebral
malaria
can
not
simulate
deep
coma
or
frantic
struggling
delirium
a
drop
of
blood
from
the
lobe
of
the
ear
and
the
microscope
reveals
the
deadly
crescents
the
form
the
subtertian
parasite
assumes
in
this
condition
no
time
this
for
waiting
or
expectant
treatment
quinine
must
be
given
in
huge
doses
regardless
of
the
danger
of
blackwater
and
into
the
muscles
or
dissolved
in
salt
solution
into
the
veins
the
germans
have
left
me
some
fine
hollow
needles
that
practice
makes
easy
to
pass
into
the
distended
swollen
veins
through
this
needle
large
doses
of
quinine
are
injected
and
in
six
hours
usually
no
crescent
remains
to
be
seen
as
a
rule
conscious
life
returns
to
these
senseless
bodies
after
some
hours
but
unhappily
such
success
does
not
always
crown
our
efforts
then
it
is
the
padre
turn
and
in
the
cool
of
the
following
afternoon
the
firing
party
with
arms
reversed
toils
behind
our
to
that
graveyard
on
the
sunlit
slopes
of
mount
uluguru
where
our
surgical
failures
are
put
to
rest
one
can
always
tell
you
know
the
onset
of
such
a
complication
as
this
for
when
one
finds
the
victim
of
malaria
hazy
and
stupid
after
his
fever
has
abated
and
more
especially
if
he
develops
wandering
tendencies
leaving
his
stretcher
at
night
to
choose
another
bed
in
the
ward
often
to
the
protesting
consternation
of
its
present
occupant
then
one
passes
the
word
to
sister
elizabeth
to
get
the
transfusion
apparatus
ready
i
shall
not
readily
forget
one
stout
fellow
a
white
company
in
the
gold
coast
regiment
who
was
lost
in
the
bush
and
discovered
after
many
days
in
the
grip
of
this
fell
disease
him
they
bore
swiftly
to
me
at
handeni
and
after
many
injections
and
convulsions
innumerable
he
was
restored
to
conscious
life
again
sent
back
by
me
eventually
to
korogwe
with
a
letter
advising
his
invaliding
out
of
the
country
he
opened
and
read
my
report
upon
the
way
but
he
was
of
those
who
do
not
take
kindly
to
invaliding
who
would
run
his
section
if
he
were
away
and
his
battalion
in
action
who
like
he
could
know
the
language
and
the
little
failings
of
his
dusky
crew
that
he
had
trained
so
long
and
so
carefully
in
the
cameroon
so
he
appeared
in
the
books
of
the
stationary
hospital
at
korogwe
as
an
ordinary
case
of
convalescent
malaria
on
his
own
statement
and
when
they
would
send
him
still
further
back
to
he
broke
out
from
hospital
one
night
and
with
his
native
orderly
boarded
the
train
to
railhead
and
marched
the
other
miles
to
morogoro
here
i
met
him
on
the
road
starting
out
on
the
next
long
trek
of
miles
to
kissaki
for
news
had
come
to
him
that
the
gold
coast
regiment
had
been
in
action
and
their
impetuous
courage
rewarded
by
captured
enemy
guns
and
a
long
casualty
list
but
he
was
determined
and
unrepentant
one
of
his
beloved
had
been
put
out
of
action
how
could
i
hold
him
back
so
joining
forces
with
another
white
sergeant
of
his
regiment
who
was
hardly
recovered
from
a
wound
these
two
good
fellows
set
out
with
a
note
that
time
was
not
to
be
destroyed
for
the
instruction
of
their
regimental
doctor
a
third
scourge
responsible
for
frequent
admissions
into
hospital
is
rather
an
unpleasant
name
is
it
and
in
its
course
and
effect
it
fully
acts
up
to
its
reputation
more
commonly
known
as
relapsing
fever
this
illness
attacks
men
who
have
been
sleeping
on
the
floor
of
native
huts
which
in
this
country
are
swarming
with
these
parasites
once
in
seven
days
for
five
or
seven
weeks
these
men
burn
with
high
fever
higher
and
more
violent
even
than
malaria
but
sooner
over
as
you
may
imagine
it
leaves
them
very
debilitated
for
no
sooner
does
the
victim
recover
from
one
attack
than
another
is
due
the
ticks
that
are
the
host
of
the
spirillum
the
actual
cause
of
the
disease
live
in
the
soft
earth
on
the
floor
of
native
huts
at
the
junction
of
the
vertical
cane
rods
and
the
soil
here
by
scraping
you
may
discover
hundreds
of
these
loathsome
beasts
in
every
foot
of
wall
but
they
are
fortunately
different
from
the
grass
ticks
that
though
unpleasant
are
not
dangerous
to
man
for
the
tick
that
carries
the
spirillum
is
blind
and
can
not
climb
any
smooth
surface
so
to
one
sleeping
on
a
bed
or
even
a
native
machela
above
the
ground
he
is
harmless
but
woe
betide
the
tired
soldier
who
attempts
to
escape
the
tropical
rain
by
taking
refuge
on
the
floor
in
sleep
he
is
attacked
and
when
his
blind
assailant
is
full
of
blood
he
drops
off
so
the
soldier
may
never
know
that
he
has
been
bitten
i
got
twelve
cases
alone
from
one
company
of
the
rhodesians
who
sheltered
in
a
native
village
near
kissaki
of
course
not
every
tick
is
infected
and
for
that
we
have
to
be
very
grateful
at
the
height
of
the
fever
the
spirillum
appears
in
the
blood
as
an
attenuated
creature
actively
struggling
and
squirming
among
the
blood
corpuscles
a
drop
of
blood
taken
from
the
ear
shows
hundreds
of
these
young
snakes
beneath
the
microscope
for
the
cure
we
are
again
indebted
to
that
excellent
hun
bacteriologist
ehrlich
who
gave
us
a
strong
arsenical
preparation
that
we
dissolve
in
a
pint
of
salt
solution
and
inject
into
the
veins
at
the
height
of
the
paroxysm
of
fever
this
definitely
destroys
the
spirillum
and
no
further
attacks
of
fever
result
but
this
injection
once
its
work
is
done
does
not
confer
immunity
from
other
attacks
it
is
typical
of
the
hun
and
his
feelings
that
ehrlich
the
most
distinguished
of
german
scientists
perhaps
after
koch
has
never
received
the
due
reward
of
all
the
distinction
he
has
conferred
on
german
medicine
for
the
offence
that
he
was
a
jew
we
should
have
honoured
him
as
we
have
done
jenner
or
lister
relapsing
or
fever
as
the
germans
call
it
was
one
of
the
common
dodges
used
by
them
to
deceive
the
ingenuous
british
doctor
for
the
subtle
hun
prisoner
knew
that
if
he
pretended
to
this
disease
it
would
win
him
at
least
a
week
in
the
grateful
comfort
of
a
hospital
and
perchance
the
ministering
joys
conferred
by
german
nursing
sisters
until
the
expected
relapse
did
not
occur
then
the
british
doctor
realising
the
extent
of
his
deception
would
thrust
these
shameless
malingerers
to
the
cold
comfort
of
the
prison
camp
how
is
it
you
might
ask
me
that
there
are
any
natives
left
if
tropical
africa
is
so
full
of
such
beastly
diseases
as
this
is
it
that
the
native
is
naturally
immune
or
is
it
that
the
white
man
is
of
such
a
precious
quality
that
he
alone
is
attacked
by
these
parasites
and
poisonous
biting
flies
the
fact
is
that
the
native
is
affected
also
and
in
childhood
chiefly
so
that
the
infant
mortality
in
many
native
tribes
is
very
high
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
repeated
attacks
of
malaria
in
youth
if
recovered
from
do
confer
a
kind
of
protection
against
attacks
in
adult
life
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
newly
introduced
disease
for
the
sleeping
sickness
that
came
to
uganda
along
the
caravan
routes
from
the
congo
has
swept
away
fully
a
million
of
the
natives
along
the
shores
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
but
the
native
has
a
sure
sense
of
the
unhealthiness
of
any
locality
and
one
must
be
prepared
for
trouble
when
one
notices
that
the
native
villages
are
built
up
on
the
hillsides
this
was
specially
remarked
by
us
on
our
long
trek
down
the
pangani
and
thus
we
were
warned
of
the
fever
that
lurked
in
the
bright
green
lush
meadows
beside
the
water
and
the
fly
that
soon
overtook
our
transport
mules
and
cattle
and
the
horses
of
general
brits
mounted
brigade
at
first
we
thought
the
columns
of
smoke
along
the
beside
the
pangani
were
signal
fires
for
the
enemy
but
before
long
when
the
roads
were
choked
with
victims
of
fly
and
we
realised
the
wisdom
that
induced
the
simple
native
to
take
his
sheep
and
cattle
up
the
hillsides
and
above
the
danger
zone
when
one
spends
only
a
short
time
in
some
native
huts
it
is
quite
clear
how
he
escapes
infection
for
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
layer
of
wood
ashes
that
is
usually
deadly
to
bugs
and
fleas
and
ticks
and
other
crawling
beasts
and
the
atmosphere
is
so
full
of
wood
smoke
that
the
most
enterprising
mosquito
or
would
flee
as
we
do
choking
from
the
acrid
smoke
so
the
native
fire
that
burns
within
his
hut
day
and
night
not
only
serves
to
cook
his
food
and
to
keep
wild
beasts
away
but
also
supplies
him
with
an
excellent
form
of
keating
powder
for
the
floor
and
smoke
to
drive
the
winged
insects
from
the
grateful
warmth
of
his
fireside
lying
beside
the
road
with
outstretched
neck
and
a
spume
of
white
froth
on
nose
and
muzzle
are
the
horses
of
the
mounted
brigade
with
bodies
swollen
by
the
decomposition
that
sets
in
so
rapidly
in
this
sun
and
smelling
to
high
heaven
are
the
fine
young
horses
that
came
so
gallantly
through
kahe
some
ten
days
ago
brits
violets
the
tommies
call
them
as
they
seek
a
site
to
windward
to
pitch
their
tents
hyacinths
they
mutter
as
the
wind
changes
in
the
night
and
drives
them
choking
from
their
blankets
illustrating
the
truth
of
the
south
african
maxim
one
horse
suffices
to
move
a
camp
if
he
be
dead
enough
for
weeks
after
the
brigade
passed
through
the
air
was
full
of
stench
and
the
bush
at
night
alive
with
lions
coming
for
the
feast
for
this
is
the
plague
that
strikes
an
apparently
healthy
horse
dead
in
his
tracks
while
the
boer
trooper
hastily
removes
bridle
and
saddle
and
picks
another
horse
from
the
drove
of
remounts
that
follow
after
no
time
to
drag
the
body
off
the
road
so
the
huge
motor
lorries
choose
another
track
in
the
bush
to
avoid
this
unwholesome
obstruction
takes
ten
short
days
to
develop
after
infection
and
the
organism
is
so
tiny
that
it
passes
through
the
finest
filter
and
is
ultramicroscopic
that
means
that
it
is
too
small
to
be
recognised
by
the
high
power
of
an
ordinary
microscope
there
was
in
the
bush
meadows
beside
the
river
near
kahe
careless
troopers
watered
their
horses
after
sundown
when
the
dew
was
on
the
grass
and
death
lurked
in
the
evening
moisture
where
it
had
been
absent
in
the
dry
heat
of
the
afternoon
the
wounded
from
kissaki
two
very
busy
days
were
before
us
when
the
wounded
came
in
from
kissaki
so
badly
shaken
and
so
pale
and
wan
after
their
journey
they
had
been
cared
for
by
the
field
ambulance
before
i
got
them
and
by
the
extraordinary
excellence
of
the
surgery
paid
the
greatest
of
tributes
to
the
care
of
the
surgeons
in
front
the
german
hospital
there
half
finished
for
our
advance
had
been
far
ahead
of
german
calculations
fell
into
our
hands
and
with
it
a
german
doctor
and
some
nurses
the
nurses
had
been
very
kind
to
our
men
and
worked
well
for
our
doctors
but
they
had
followed
the
usual
german
custom
in
this
country
of
being
too
liberal
with
morphia
that
this
drug
can
become
a
curse
is
well
known
though
it
is
when
given
in
reason
the
greatest
blessing
the
most
priceless
boon
of
war
one
feels
perhaps
that
the
sisters
had
given
it
without
the
surgeon
knowledge
and
not
entirely
to
give
ease
from
pain
but
also
perhaps
to
give
rest
to
the
ward
the
quiet
that
would
allow
these
women
to
get
some
sleep
themselves
it
was
written
on
the
faces
of
the
three
amputation
cases
that
they
had
had
too
much
morphia
and
as
this
drug
robs
men
of
their
appetite
keeps
them
thin
and
prevents
their
wounds
from
healing
it
became
my
unpleasant
task
to
break
them
of
it
this
was
only
to
be
done
by
hardening
heart
by
giving
bromide
and
stout
and
insisting
on
the
egg
and
milk
that
interspaced
all
meals
it
is
so
easy
to
get
a
reputation
for
kindness
by
being
too
complacent
in
giving
way
to
requests
for
morphia
it
made
one
feel
such
an
absolute
brute
to
disregard
the
wistful
pleading
eye
the
hands
that
tugged
at
the
mosquito
curtains
to
show
they
were
awake
when
late
at
night
i
made
my
evening
round
but
it
had
to
be
done
and
i
fear
the
work
and
the
sun
and
the
tropics
made
one
temper
very
short
particularly
when
it
was
only
possible
by
losing
one
temper
to
preserve
the
indifference
to
these
influences
that
was
necessary
to
complete
the
cure
it
was
very
hard
on
them
at
the
time
especially
as
they
were
rotten
with
malaria
and
tick
fever
in
addition
to
their
wounds
but
there
were
other
ways
in
which
one
made
it
up
to
them
if
they
did
but
know
it
nor
did
they
see
that
quinine
given
by
the
veins
so
much
more
trouble
to
me
and
to
the
sister
was
better
for
them
than
the
quinine
tablet
that
was
so
easily
swallowed
and
so
ineffectual
nor
could
they
one
thought
always
know
that
had
to
be
given
for
tick
fever
and
that
it
was
of
no
value
save
when
given
at
the
height
of
fever
when
they
felt
so
miserable
and
so
disinclined
to
be
disturbed
there
was
shelley
the
irishman
a
big
policeman
from
johannesburg
badly
wounded
in
the
thigh
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
germans
and
remained
so
for
three
days
until
our
next
advance
found
him
installed
in
the
german
hospital
his
wound
was
so
bad
that
amputation
alone
was
left
to
do
when
the
worst
of
the
dressings
was
over
and
the
stage
of
daily
change
of
gauze
and
bandage
had
arrived
he
always
liked
sister
elizabeth
to
do
his
dressings
sister
hands
were
much
more
gentle
than
mine
and
shelley
always
associated
me
with
pain
little
knowing
that
if
a
dressing
is
to
be
well
and
properly
done
it
is
always
inseparable
from
a
certain
amount
of
suffering
but
i
saw
through
his
blarney
and
he
was
added
to
the
list
of
those
who
preferred
sister
hands
to
my
attentions
and
there
was
rose
a
mere
lad
who
had
also
lost
a
leg
from
wounds
he
lay
awake
at
night
though
not
in
great
pain
during
the
process
of
breaking
him
of
the
morphia
habit
when
i
pretended
not
to
hear
his
little
moan
as
i
made
my
evening
round
he
tugged
at
his
mosquito
curtain
to
show
that
he
was
awake
but
asperin
and
bromide
and
a
nightly
drink
of
hot
brandy
and
water
soon
broke
off
this
habit
after
that
it
was
easy
to
cut
off
the
alcohol
by
degrees
as
he
grew
to
like
his
eggs
in
milk
the
more
he
too
always
had
some
reason
why
sister
should
do
his
dressings
and
i
think
that
sister
elizabeth
and
he
plotted
together
that
i
should
have
some
other
more
important
job
to
do
when
rose
turn
came
to
go
upon
the
table
then
there
was
parsons
the
printer
who
in
times
of
peace
produced
the
daily
he
had
also
lost
a
leg
and
he
surprised
me
with
his
special
knowledge
of
the
various
qualities
of
paper
in
the
corner
of
the
verandah
that
had
been
turned
into
an
extra
ward
by
screening
it
off
with
native
was
gilfillan
the
most
perfect
patient
propping
his
foot
against
the
wall
to
correct
the
that
division
of
the
nerve
of
his
leg
had
caused
he
had
passed
many
sleepless
nights
in
his
long
and
wearisome
convalescence
beside
the
door
beckoning
to
me
in
a
mysterious
manner
was
drury
a
trooper
in
the
south
african
horse
in
his
eyes
a
suspicious
light
as
he
earnestly
requested
to
be
moved
for
god
sake
take
me
away
they
trying
to
poison
my
food
and
those
germans
over
there
are
going
to
shoot
me
this
poor
lad
had
been
shot
badly
through
the
shoulder
and
only
by
the
skill
of
moffat
the
surgeon
from
cape
town
had
he
retained
what
was
left
of
his
shattered
arm
now
malaria
in
addition
had
him
in
its
grip
and
his
mental
condition
told
me
plainly
that
his
brain
was
being
affected
with
the
greatest
difficulty
sister
elizabeth
and
i
persuaded
him
to
undergo
the
quinine
transfusion
into
his
veins
that
restored
him
to
sober
sense
the
next
day
i
really
did
think
those
two
german
prisoners
were
going
to
shoot
me
he
said
but
the
two
prisoners
in
his
ward
were
more
afraid
of
him
than
he
of
them
and
their
broken
legs
for
they
had
got
in
the
way
of
one
of
our
precluded
any
movement
from
their
beds
our
men
were
extraordinarily
kind
to
german
prisoners
in
the
ward
the
boers
were
different
they
were
never
unkind
but
they
ignored
them
completely
for
the
union
of
south
africa
had
too
much
to
forgive
in
the
rebellion
and
in
german
africa
now
then
fritz
there
ai
no
bleeding
sausage
for
you
this
morning
and
fritz
smilingly
obedient
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
cold
bacon
that
was
his
breakfast
toward
the
end
sister
hildegarde
was
just
as
kind
to
our
men
as
she
was
to
her
own
people
and
she
was
highly
indignant
with
me
when
i
stopped
the
night
orderly
from
waking
her
early
one
morning
when
i
had
to
transfuse
a
blackwater
case
with
salt
solution
she
thought
she
who
had
had
quite
enough
to
do
the
day
before
that
i
did
not
call
her
because
i
thought
she
did
not
want
to
get
up
she
felt
that
i
was
tacitly
drawing
a
distinction
between
her
conduct
of
that
morning
and
the
of
the
other
night
when
she
and
elizabeth
sat
up
all
night
and
day
with
a
german
soldier
who
had
perforated
his
intestines
during
an
attack
of
typhoid
fever
i
had
operated
upon
him
to
close
the
hole
the
typhoid
ulcer
had
made
the
german
doctor
to
whom
we
had
given
his
liberty
in
order
that
he
might
attend
the
civil
population
and
whom
i
had
called
in
consultation
over
the
case
had
disagreed
with
our
diagnosis
but
i
had
overruled
him
and
at
the
operation
was
glad
to
be
able
to
show
him
and
the
german
sisters
that
our
diagnosis
was
right
and
that
i
was
not
operating
on
him
just
because
he
happened
to
be
a
prisoner
of
war
the
german
sisters
were
grateful
to
us
for
getting
up
at
night
and
in
the
early
morning
to
give
him
the
salt
solution
that
might
save
his
life
and
they
repaid
it
in
the
only
way
they
could
by
kindness
to
our
men
but
in
any
case
they
could
not
help
liking
our
sick
soldiers
and
many
is
the
time
that
they
have
been
indignant
with
me
for
deficiencies
in
food
and
equipment
which
i
could
not
help
our
german
soldiers
would
have
complained
until
their
cries
reached
lettow
himself
they
said
if
they
had
to
put
up
with
what
you
make
your
soldiers
endure
and
if
at
first
hildegarde
of
the
sour
and
disapproving
face
did
little
irregular
things
for
wounded
german
soldiers
faked
temperature
charts
prepared
little
forbidden
meals
at
night
and
in
other
ways
pretended
to
a
degree
of
illness
in
her
german
soldiers
that
my
clinical
eye
refused
to
see
i
could
not
altogether
blame
her
when
i
remembered
the
treatment
that
i
saw
our
sick
and
wounded
prisoners
in
germany
get
from
the
hun
doctor
i
was
often
furious
and
determined
to
do
a
bit
of
strafing
on
my
own
but
i
could
not
forget
that
the
french
and
belgian
nurses
did
just
the
same
for
our
wounded
in
german
hands
adding
bandages
to
unwounded
limbs
describing
to
the
german
doctor
our
sleepless
nights
of
pain
when
the
walls
of
that
french
convent
had
echoed
only
to
our
snores
preparing
delicious
feasts
at
night
for
us
to
compensate
for
german
rations
and
in
many
ways
contriving
to
keep
us
longer
in
their
hands
and
to
postpone
the
journey
that
would
land
us
in
the
vileness
of
a
german
prison
hospital
hildegarde
had
her
troubles
too
for
she
had
not
heard
for
two
years
of
her
lover
in
germany
whose
mild
and
bespectacled
face
peered
from
a
photograph
in
her
room
he
did
not
look
to
be
made
of
heroic
mould
but
who
can
tell
long
ago
he
may
have
bitten
the
dust
of
flanders
or
found
another
sweetheart
to
console
him
and
the
native
hospital
boys
swift
to
recognise
the
changes
of
war
and
the
comparative
leniency
of
british
discipline
got
out
of
hand
and
failed
to
clean
and
scrub
as
they
did
in
former
days
then
i
would
inquire
and
uphold
hildegarde
and
the
recalcitrant
mahomed
would
be
marched
off
to
receive
fifteen
of
the
best
from
the
provost
sergeant
my
operating
theatre
in
morogoro
jambo
bwona
and
the
sycophantic
ali
would
leap
to
his
feet
and
raise
the
dirty
red
fez
that
adorned
his
head
jambo
said
nazoro
the
senior
boy
standing
to
attention
for
nazoro
was
a
wanyamwezi
from
lake
tanganyika
and
disdained
any
of
ali
dodges
to
conciliate
me
graceful
as
a
deer
was
nazoro
and
a
good
askari
lost
in
a
better
boy
this
was
my
morning
greeting
as
i
peeped
in
before
breakfast
to
see
that
the
operating
theatre
was
swept
and
garnished
for
the
day
work
good
morning
said
elizabeth
looking
up
from
the
steriliser
where
she
was
preparing
instruments
for
the
morning
operations
educated
partly
in
england
and
speaking
the
language
perfectly
she
hated
us
only
a
little
less
than
the
other
germans
but
she
was
good
at
her
job
and
conscientious
and
a
very
great
help
to
us
always
as
cheerful
as
one
could
expect
a
woman
to
be
who
worked
for
the
english
soldiers
and
dressed
the
wounds
of
men
to
fit
them
to
return
to
the
field
to
fight
against
her
people
again
who
knows
that
the
tall
rhodesian
from
whose
feet
she
so
skilfully
removed
the
jiggers
and
cleansed
the
wounds
of
a
long
trek
would
not
all
the
sooner
for
her
care
perhaps
be
drawing
a
bead
upon
her
husband
in
the
near
future
very
proud
was
elizabeth
of
her
husband
iron
cross
that
the
kaiser
had
sent
by
wireless
only
last
week
news
of
which
was
told
to
her
by
a
wounded
prisoner
just
brought
in
for
her
husband
who
to
judge
from
his
wife
description
must
have
been
quite
a
good
fellow
for
a
hun
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
schutzen
companies
down
near
the
rufigi
he
too
had
lived
long
in
england
to
learn
the
ways
of
english
shipping
companies
that
would
prove
of
such
value
to
the
deutsch
line
so
jubilant
was
she
at
the
news
that
i
had
to
give
her
a
to
recover
twice
only
in
the
four
months
we
worked
together
was
elizabeth
as
happy
once
when
she
got
a
letter
by
the
infinite
kindness
of
general
smuts
from
her
husband
and
another
time
when
a
letter
came
from
switzerland
to
tell
her
of
her
baby
in
hamburg
her
mother
and
the
two
brothers
that
were
in
the
cavalry
in
the
advance
into
russia
at
first
i
must
confess
i
thought
that
this
charming
and
intelligent
lady
had
offered
to
work
for
us
especially
as
she
refused
our
pay
in
order
to
get
information
of
the
regiments
and
the
prevailing
diseases
and
sick
rate
of
our
army
soon
i
had
reason
to
know
that
she
played
the
game
and
stayed
only
in
order
to
work
to
help
the
prisoners
of
her
own
people
and
our
wounded
too
for
any
day
her
husband
might
want
help
from
us
or
might
be
brought
in
wounded
to
our
hospital
where
she
could
nurse
and
tend
to
him
herself
our
men
liked
to
be
attended
by
her
for
she
was
gentler
far
than
i
and
never
with
them
nazoro
we
found
in
chains
on
our
arrival
for
the
offence
of
having
attacked
a
german
and
only
his
usefulness
in
the
operating
theatre
saved
him
from
the
prison
in
spite
of
the
disapproval
of
elizabeth
and
other
germans
i
struck
off
the
chains
feeling
that
he
very
probably
had
good
excuse
for
his
offence
but
the
germans
never
failed
to
point
out
what
a
dangerous
man
he
was
once
indeed
he
was
slack
and
casual
so
i
promptly
ordered
him
to
be
kibokoed
and
thereafter
i
could
find
no
fault
in
his
work
and
behaviour
possessed
of
three
wives
for
he
was
passing
rich
on
sixteen
rupees
a
month
he
asked
one
day
for
leave
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
his
first
son
this
i
granted
only
to
be
assailed
a
fortnight
later
by
requests
for
leave
to
attend
his
grandmother
funeral
and
to
see
a
sick
friend
but
these
had
a
familiar
ring
about
them
and
were
not
successful
in
procuring
the
lazy
day
that
is
so
beloved
by
african
humanity
but
ali
was
of
a
different
mould
small
and
slight
and
anxious
to
please
he
was
nevertheless
swift
to
leave
his
work
when
once
my
back
was
turned
forsaken
in
love
for
he
had
been
deserted
by
his
wife
he
had
forsworn
the
sex
and
buried
his
sorrows
in
pombe
the
kaffir
beer
that
effectually
deprived
him
of
what
little
intelligence
he
had
he
was
a
fundi
at
taking
out
jiggers
and
sat
for
hours
at
the
feet
of
our
quickly
adopting
an
air
of
authority
that
occasionally
brought
him
swift
blows
from
east
african
troopers
who
do
not
tolerate
easily
such
airs
in
a
native
he
produced
the
unbroken
jigger
flea
with
unfailing
regularity
and
prescribed
the
pail
of
disinfectant
in
which
the
tortured
feet
were
soaked
another
long
suit
of
his
was
the
bandage
machine
and
the
hours
he
could
steal
away
from
real
work
were
spent
in
endless
windings
of
washed
though
much
stained
bandages
the
german
women
hated
us
far
more
even
than
did
the
men
nor
did
those
who
like
elizabeth
knew
england
fail
to
believe
any
the
less
the
german
stories
of
english
wickedness
when
i
told
her
of
entry
into
the
war
and
how
our
ancient
and
hereditary
ally
had
handed
over
to
england
sixty
out
of
the
german
ships
she
had
taken
in
her
ports
elizabeth
snorted
with
rage
and
said
that
england
of
course
forced
all
the
little
nations
to
fight
against
germany
one
of
my
friends
and
not
the
least
welcome
was
corporal
nel
a
boer
he
had
come
up
from
the
union
with
brits
tiring
of
war
he
chose
the
nobler
part
played
by
the
guard
that
cherishes
german
captured
cattle
swiftly
losing
his
job
owing
to
an
outbreak
of
east
coast
fever
among
his
herd
he
took
to
a
vagabond
life
wanted
by
the
police
in
the
union
i
am
told
he
avoided
his
regiment
and
lived
with
the
natives
forced
to
come
to
me
one
night
with
an
attack
of
angina
pectoris
he
was
grateful
for
the
ease
from
suffering
that
morphia
and
brandy
gave
in
that
exquisitely
painful
affliction
accordingly
he
consented
to
organise
some
natives
who
should
be
armed
with
passes
signed
by
me
and
illuminated
with
red
crosses
and
other
impressive
signs
and
collect
eggs
and
chickens
and
fruit
for
my
patients
in
hospital
so
impressed
were
the
natives
with
the
conferred
by
my
illumination
of
these
passes
with
coloured
chalks
that
they
brought
me
a
daily
and
most
welcome
supply
of
these
necessaries
for
our
men
but
the
arm
of
the
law
is
long
and
it
sought
out
corporal
nel
within
the
native
hut
in
which
he
made
his
home
and
soon
to
my
sorrow
and
the
infinite
grief
of
our
lambs
in
hospital
for
whom
those
eggs
chickens
mangoes
and
bananas
spelt
so
much
in
the
way
of
change
of
food
the
provost
sergeant
had
this
wanderer
in
his
chitches
the
german
in
peace
and
war
what
do
i
think
of
this
country
and
how
does
the
hun
of
east
africa
compare
with
his
european
brother
you
ask
me
well
to
begin
with
the
colony
as
of
the
greater
importance
i
must
confess
to
be
very
taken
with
it
and
i
hope
most
sincerely
that
our
government
will
never
give
it
back
though
it
is
not
so
suited
as
british
east
africa
for
european
colonisation
there
are
yet
great
areas
of
sufficient
elevation
to
allow
of
white
women
and
children
living
for
years
without
suffering
much
from
the
vertical
sun
and
the
fevers
of
the
country
there
are
many
places
where
one
only
sees
a
mosquito
for
three
months
of
the
year
the
soil
is
very
fertile
and
labour
not
only
willing
and
efficient
but
also
very
cheap
the
european
too
has
learnt
to
live
properly
in
this
country
and
to
avoid
the
midday
sun
all
offices
and
works
are
closed
from
twelve
to
three
if
only
man
would
learn
wisdom
in
the
amount
of
beer
he
drinks
and
the
food
he
eats
the
tale
of
disease
would
be
much
less
the
colony
is
fully
developed
with
excellent
railways
houses
a
tractable
and
native
population
in
particular
seems
to
have
been
the
apple
of
the
german
colonial
eye
there
are
fine
mission
stations
in
all
the
healthy
regions
of
the
country
and
great
plantations
of
rubber
sisal
cotton
and
corn
abound
the
white
women
and
children
though
rather
pasty
and
washed
out
after
at
least
two
years
residence
in
the
country
do
not
appear
debilitated
after
their
long
tropical
sojourn
the
planters
have
as
a
rule
invested
all
their
belongings
in
their
plantations
and
make
the
country
more
a
home
than
our
people
in
east
africa
who
are
of
a
more
wealthy
and
leisured
class
roads
have
been
made
and
bridges
built
in
fact
the
pioneering
and
donkey
work
has
all
been
done
and
the
country
only
waits
for
us
to
step
into
our
new
inheritance
to
me
it
has
been
a
source
of
surprise
that
the
german
who
consistently
drinks
beer
in
huge
quantities
takes
little
or
no
exercise
and
cohabits
with
the
black
women
of
the
country
extensively
should
have
performed
such
prodigies
of
endurance
on
trek
in
this
campaign
one
would
have
thought
that
the
englishman
who
keeps
his
body
fitter
for
games
eschews
beer
for
his
liver
sake
and
finds
that
intimacy
with
the
native
population
lowers
his
prestige
would
have
done
far
better
in
this
war
than
the
german
that
in
all
fairness
he
has
not
done
so
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
as
an
invading
army
were
unable
to
look
after
ourselves
or
to
care
for
ourselves
in
the
same
way
as
the
german
we
have
had
to
carry
kit
and
heavy
ammunition
to
sleep
with
only
a
ground
sheet
beneath
us
through
the
tropic
rains
to
do
without
the
shelter
and
protection
of
mosquito
nets
the
german
soldier
even
a
private
in
a
white
or
schutzen
kompanie
as
distinct
from
the
with
an
askari
regiment
or
feld
kompanie
as
it
is
called
has
had
at
least
eight
porters
to
carry
all
his
kit
his
food
his
bed
to
have
his
food
ready
prepared
at
the
and
his
bed
erected
and
mosquito
curtains
hung
only
on
night
patrols
has
he
run
risk
from
the
mosquito
how
can
you
ask
your
men
to
carry
loads
and
then
fight
as
well
in
equatorial
africa
they
say
to
us
his
captured
chop
boxes
for
each
individual
is
a
separate
unit
and
has
his
own
food
carried
and
prepared
for
him
have
provided
us
often
with
the
only
square
meals
our
men
have
enjoyed
never
short
of
food
or
drink
or
porters
ever
marching
toward
his
food
supplies
along
a
predetermined
line
of
retreat
the
german
walks
toward
his
dinner
as
our
men
have
marched
away
from
theirs
well
paid
too
five
rupees
a
day
pay
and
three
rupees
a
day
ration
money
he
had
had
no
stint
of
eggs
and
chickens
and
the
fruit
of
the
country
that
have
been
rarest
of
luxuries
to
us
far
better
if
you
had
had
fewer
men
and
done
them
properly
in
the
matter
of
food
and
hospitals
and
porters
captured
german
officers
have
often
said
to
me
how
your
men
can
stand
it
and
do
such
marches
is
incredible
to
us
that
is
always
the
tenour
of
their
remarks
their
criticism
and
they
are
clearly
right
had
such
a
policy
been
a
practicable
one
for
us
which
it
was
not
at
first
the
feeling
between
the
soldiers
of
the
two
countries
was
good
and
war
was
conducted
even
by
them
in
a
more
or
less
chivalrous
manner
we
thought
the
east
african
hun
a
better
fellow
than
his
european
brother
but
it
was
only
because
he
knew
the
game
was
up
in
east
africa
and
thought
that
he
had
better
behave
properly
lest
the
retribution
that
would
be
sure
to
follow
would
fall
heavily
upon
him
later
we
found
him
to
be
the
same
old
hun
the
identical
savage
that
we
know
in
europe
the
fear
of
consequences
only
restrains
him
here
it
is
his
nature
and
the
teaching
of
his
schools
and
professors
we
have
often
been
amazed
at
the
disclosures
from
german
in
the
same
oiled
silk
wrapping
we
find
photographs
of
his
wife
and
children
and
cheek
by
jowl
with
them
the
photographs
of
abandoned
women
and
filthy
pictures
such
as
can
be
bought
in
low
quarters
of
big
european
cities
their
absence
of
taste
in
these
matters
has
been
incomprehensible
to
us
when
we
have
taxed
them
with
it
they
are
unashamed
it
is
you
who
are
hypocrites
they
reply
you
like
looking
at
forbidden
pictures
if
no
one
is
about
to
see
but
you
carry
them
in
your
we
however
are
natural
we
like
to
look
at
such
things
why
should
we
not
carry
them
with
us
if
this
be
hypocrisy
i
prefer
the
company
of
hypocrites
in
their
houses
it
was
the
same
disgusting
pictures
masquerading
in
the
guise
of
art
adorned
the
walls
evidences
of
corrupt
taste
and
doubtful
practices
in
every
drawer
and
cupboard
even
the
commandant
of
bukoba
von
stuemer
and
his
name
did
not
belie
his
nature
though
before
the
war
quite
popular
with
the
british
officials
and
planters
of
uganda
had
a
queer
taste
in
photography
in
the
big
family
album
were
evidences
of
his
astonishing
domestic
life
for
there
were
photographs
of
him
in
full
regimentals
with
medals
and
decorations
sitting
on
a
sofa
beside
his
wife
who
was
in
a
state
of
nature
others
portrayed
him
without
the
conventionalities
of
clothing
and
his
wife
in
evening
dress
officers
from
the
cameroon
have
confirmed
the
filthy
habits
of
the
huns
and
hunnesses
how
they
defiled
the
rooms
in
the
hospital
at
duala
that
they
occupied
just
before
they
were
sent
away
how
disgusting
were
their
habits
in
the
cabins
of
the
fine
atlantic
liner
that
took
them
back
to
europe
not
that
it
is
their
normal
custom
it
was
merely
to
render
the
rooms
uninhabitable
for
us
who
were
to
follow
and
their
special
way
of
showing
contempt
and
hatred
for
their
foes
do
you
wonder
that
the
stewards
and
crew
of
the
union
castle
liner
struck
work
rather
than
convey
and
look
after
these
beasts
on
the
voyage
to
europe
our
french
missionary
padre
tells
me
that
it
was
just
the
same
in
alsace
the
incident
at
zabern
after
the
manoeuvres
was
entirely
due
to
the
disgust
and
indignation
of
the
french
people
at
the
defiling
of
their
beds
and
bedrooms
by
the
german
soldiers
who
had
been
billeted
upon
them
looting
looting
although
you
may
not
know
it
is
the
natural
impulse
of
primitive
man
and
in
war
we
are
very
primitive
to
take
what
does
not
belong
to
one
is
very
natural
when
a
man
is
persuaded
that
he
can
be
absolved
from
the
charge
of
theft
by
quoting
military
necessity
how
surely
in
war
one
sheds
the
conventions
of
society
it
has
the
attraction
of
buried
treasure
the
charm
of
getting
something
for
nothing
but
there
are
different
ways
or
degrees
of
looting
now
there
were
a
few
of
us
in
german
east
africa
who
had
been
in
the
retreat
from
mons
and
the
subsequent
advance
to
the
marne
and
beyond
it
to
the
aisne
indelibly
engraved
upon
our
minds
were
the
pictures
of
french
chateaux
and
farmhouses
looted
by
the
german
troops
in
their
advance
and
abandoned
to
us
in
their
retreat
all
along
the
countless
roads
the
german
transport
had
pressed
hurrying
to
the
aisne
were
evidences
of
the
loot
of
german
officers
and
men
in
roadside
ditches
half
buried
in
the
late
summer
vegetation
were
pictures
and
bronzes
china
and
statuary
the
loot
the
german
officer
had
chosen
to
adorn
the
walls
of
his
ancestral
schloss
marble
figures
leant
drunkenly
against
the
wayside
hedges
big
brass
clocks
strewed
the
ditches
long
before
of
course
had
the
german
rank
and
file
been
compelled
to
jettison
their
prizes
for
the
transport
horses
were
nearly
foundered
and
only
officers
loot
could
be
retained
later
when
the
exhaustion
of
the
horses
was
complete
and
capture
of
the
waggons
seemed
imminent
the
regimental
equipment
and
food
supply
and
finally
the
loot
of
high
officers
had
to
be
abandoned
the
whole
story
of
that
retreat
was
to
be
read
in
the
discard
by
the
roadside
the
regimental
butcher
had
clung
to
his
meat
and
the
implements
of
his
trade
until
the
last
and
when
we
found
the
roads
littered
with
carcases
of
oxen
sacks
of
pea
flour
and
sausage
machines
we
knew
that
we
would
shortly
find
the
general
loot
beside
the
hedge
in
the
houses
too
both
the
chateaux
and
the
comfortable
french
farmhouses
we
saw
what
manner
of
man
the
hun
could
be
in
the
matter
of
looting
where
the
soldier
could
not
loot
he
could
not
refrain
from
destroying
floors
were
in
women
gear
household
goods
private
letters
and
all
the
treasures
of
french
linen
chests
trampled
by
muddy
german
boots
were
the
fine
whiteness
of
french
nor
had
the
german
soldier
refrained
from
the
last
exhibit
of
his
but
left
filthy
evidences
of
his
bestial
habits
behind
him
to
ensure
that
the
bedrooms
would
be
uninhabitable
by
us
remembering
all
these
things
we
wondered
how
our
men
would
behave
now
that
the
tables
were
turned
and
they
in
a
position
to
loot
the
treasures
of
many
german
farms
and
plantation
houses
of
course
divisional
orders
against
looting
and
wanton
destruction
were
very
strict
where
houses
were
at
the
mercy
of
small
patrols
and
bodies
of
our
men
under
officers
far
from
the
path
of
the
main
advancing
army
the
temptation
to
all
must
have
been
immense
and
it
speaks
volumes
for
the
natural
goodness
of
our
men
and
their
ingrained
sense
of
order
that
never
in
this
whole
country
was
looting
done
by
any
of
our
troops
true
many
houses
were
plundered
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
wanton
damage
but
it
was
all
done
by
the
plundering
native
or
by
the
hun
himself
in
his
retreat
for
our
calculating
enemy
left
no
stone
unturned
to
deprive
us
of
any
of
the
useful
booty
of
war
he
deliberately
destroyed
and
ravaged
and
burnt
the
property
of
his
and
mentally
determined
to
send
in
the
claim
for
damage
against
us
a
german
will
always
complain
and
send
in
a
bill
of
costs
to
us
when
he
is
once
assured
of
the
protection
of
british
troops
naturally
of
course
we
requisitioned
and
gave
receipts
for
any
article
or
property
that
might
be
of
use
to
us
for
our
hospitals
or
our
supplies
in
fact
our
scrupulous
regard
for
enemy
property
will
probably
result
in
very
many
fraudulent
claims
against
our
government
when
the
war
is
over
how
easy
to
add
mythical
articles
of
great
value
to
the
list
attested
to
by
the
signature
of
a
british
staff
officer
who
could
blame
a
hun
when
the
british
were
such
fools
and
forgery
of
receipts
so
easy
but
such
was
the
regard
we
paid
to
german
women
and
children
that
if
a
house
were
occupied
we
took
nothing
and
disturbed
nothing
a
german
farmhouse
was
an
oasis
of
plenty
amid
a
very
hungry
army
it
made
us
sometimes
wonder
whether
it
was
quite
right
to
leave
german
ducks
and
fowls
and
sheep
behind
us
when
we
had
to
live
on
mealie
meal
and
tough
but
the
women
were
so
terrified
at
first
that
we
gave
such
farms
a
wide
berth
when
scarcity
of
water
did
not
force
us
to
camp
within
the
enclosures
shortly
however
as
is
the
german
custom
these
women
would
profit
by
their
immunity
and
come
to
regimental
headquarters
that
listened
so
patiently
and
courteously
to
the
tale
of
pawpaws
or
mangoes
fruit
that
was
really
wild
vanished
in
the
night
in
no
campaign
i
dare
swear
has
so
much
respect
been
given
to
occupied
houses
so
much
consideration
to
conquered
people
the
german
government
paid
this
compliment
to
our
army
that
they
left
their
women
and
children
behind
to
our
tender
mercies
at
handeni
ours
being
a
casualty
clearing
station
our
equipment
included
stretchers
with
little
hospital
equipment
beyond
the
men
own
blankets
and
their
kit
no
sooner
did
we
come
along
and
install
ourselves
in
the
abandoned
german
fort
than
the
south
african
infantry
were
in
action
at
kangata
to
win
casualties
for
us
they
were
to
nurse
and
keep
until
convalescent
for
there
was
no
stationary
hospital
behind
us
and
forty
miles
of
the
worst
of
bad
roads
robbed
us
of
the
chance
of
transporting
them
to
the
railway
so
every
afternoon
i
went
to
german
planters
houses
empty
of
course
for
forty
miles
around
in
a
swift
ford
car
and
back
in
triumph
we
bore
bedsteads
and
soft
mattresses
that
heavy
german
bodies
so
lately
had
impressed
warm
from
the
hun
we
brought
them
to
our
wounded
down
pillows
soft
eiderdown
quilts
for
painful
broken
legs
mattresses
for
bodies
and
one
reward
the
pleasure
and
appreciation
our
men
showed
at
these
attempts
to
ameliorate
lot
they
were
so
bucked
to
see
us
coming
back
at
night
laden
with
the
treasures
of
german
linen
chests
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
see
their
dirty
unwashed
faces
grinning
at
me
from
pillows
cushions
from
hun
for
painful
amputation
stumps
so
i
had
the
double
pleasure
all
the
expectancy
and
the
delight
of
seeing
our
men
so
pleased
forty
bedsteads
and
beds
complete
we
found
in
that
district
until
the
bare
walls
of
the
jail
were
transformed
white
paint
too
we
discovered
in
plenty
and
soon
our
wards
were
virginal
in
their
whiteness
and
when
i
tell
you
that
at
one
time
i
had
no
less
than
thirteen
gunshot
fractures
of
thigh
and
leg
alone
and
other
wounds
in
proportion
in
the
hospital
you
may
judge
how
necessary
beds
were
but
the
natives
had
nearly
always
been
before
us
and
the
confusion
was
indescribable
drawers
turned
out
the
contents
strewed
upon
the
floors
cupboards
broken
into
and
all
portable
articles
removed
pathetic
traces
everywhere
of
the
happy
family
life
before
war
devastating
fingers
rifled
all
their
treasures
photographs
private
letters
a
doll
house
children
broken
toys
and
from
some
letters
one
gathered
that
insight
into
the
relations
between
the
plantation
owner
and
the
manager
who
lived
there
at
one
farm
apparently
owned
by
an
englishman
who
paid
his
manager
a
german
dane
from
flensburg
the
princely
sum
of
rupees
a
month
we
found
that
one
at
least
of
our
own
people
knew
how
to
grind
the
uttermost
labour
from
his
german
employee
for
there
were
letters
from
the
manager
asking
for
leave
after
years
labour
at
this
plantation
and
pointing
out
that
the
german
government
had
laid
down
the
principle
of
european
leave
every
two
years
to
this
came
the
cold
reply
that
his
employer
cared
nothing
for
german
government
regulations
the
contract
was
for
three
years
and
he
would
see
to
it
that
this
provision
was
carried
out
one
later
letter
begged
for
financial
assistance
to
tide
him
over
the
coming
months
for
his
wife
and
children
had
been
ill
and
he
himself
in
hospital
at
korogwe
with
blackwater
fever
for
two
months
and
how
shall
i

for

if
my

sherry
and
bitters
a
common
inquiry
put
to
doctors
is
what
do
you
think
of
the
alcohol
question
in
a
tropical
campaign
do
we
not
think
that
it
is
a
good
thing
that
our
army
is
by
force
of
circumstances
a
teetotal
one
much
as
we
regret
to
depart
from
an
attitude
that
is
on
the
whole
hostile
to
alcohol
i
must
say
that
it
is
our
conviction
that
in
the
tropics
a
certain
amount
of
diffusible
stimulant
is
very
beneficial
and
quite
free
from
harm
and
the
cheapest
and
most
reliable
stimulant
of
that
nature
one
can
obtain
commercially
is
of
course
whiskey
this
whole
campaign
has
been
almost
entirely
a
teetotal
one
for
reasons
of
transport
and
inability
to
get
drink
not
for
any
other
reason
i
can
assure
you
but
where
the
absence
of
alcohol
has
been
no
doubt
responsible
for
a
wonderful
degree
of
excellent
behaviour
among
our
troops
i
yet
know
that
the
few
who
were
able
to
get
a
drink
at
night
felt
all
the
better
for
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
here
when
the
sun
has
set
and
darkness
swiftly
falling
sends
us
to
our
tents
and
bivouacs
there
comes
a
feeling
of
intense
exhaustion
especially
if
any
exercise
has
been
taken
and
exercise
in
some
form
as
you
have
heard
is
absolutely
essential
to
health
after
the
sun
has
descended
toward
the
west
about
four
in
the
afternoon
for
men
and
officers
go
sick
in
standing
camp
more
than
on
trek
and
often
the
more
and
the
longer
the
men
are
left
in
camp
to
rest
with
the
intention
of
recuperation
the
more
they
go
down
with
malaria
and
dysentery
it
is
no
sudden
conclusion
we
have
come
to
as
to
the
value
of
alcohol
but
we
certainly
feel
that
a
drink
or
two
at
night
does
no
one
any
harm
but
the
drink
for
tropics
must
not
be
fermented
liquor
beer
and
wine
are
headachy
and
livery
things
whisky
and
particularly
vermouth
are
far
the
best
and
vermouth
is
really
such
a
pleasant
wholesome
drink
too
the
idea
of
vermouth
alone
is
attractive
for
it
is
made
from
the
dried
flowers
of
camomile
to
which
the
later
pressings
of
the
grape
have
been
added
one
has
only
to
smell
dried
camomile
flowers
to
find
that
their
fragrance
is
that
of
hay
meadows
in
an
english
june
camomile
preparations
too
are
now
so
largely
used
in
medicine
and
still
keep
their
reputation
for
wholesome
and
soothing
qualities
that
it
has
enjoyed
for
generations
how
could
one
think
that
harm
could
lurk
in
the
tincture
of
such
fragrant
things
as
the
flowers
of
english
meadows
no
little
reputation
as
a
cure
and
preventive
for
blackwater
fever
does
vermouth
enjoy
we
know
that
we
must
always
if
we
would
be
wise
be
guided
by
local
experience
and
local
custom
and
it
is
told
of
the
boundary
commission
in
east
africa
that
the
frontier
between
the
two
protectorates
can
still
be
traced
by
the
empty
vermouth
bottles
but
there
were
no
cases
of
blackwater
i
am
told
on
that
very
long
and
trying
expedition
in
the
survey
of
the
whole
question
of
prohibition
in
the
future
the
essential
difference
of
the
requirements
of
humanity
in
tropical
countries
must
be
taken
into
consideration
there
is
no
doubt
and
in
this
all
medical
men
of
long
tropical
experience
will
agree
that
some
stimulant
is
needed
by
blond
humanity
living
out
of
his
geographical
environment
and
debilitated
by
the
adverse
influence
of
his
lack
of
pigment
the
vertical
sun
and
a
tropical
heat
it
is
more
than
probable
that
a
proviso
will
have
to
be
added
to
any
scheme
of
prohibition
the
cocktail
the
universal
sherry
and
bitters
and
sundowner
will
have
to
be
retained
to
expect
a
man
so
exhausted
that
the
very
idea
of
food
is
distasteful
to
digest
his
dinner
is
to
ask
too
much
of
one
digestive
apparatus
and
this
we
must
all
admit
that
if
a
man
in
the
tropics
does
not
eat
then
certainty
he
may
not
live
native
porters
toiling
behind
the
column
on
march
is
the
long
and
ragged
line
of
native
porters
the
human
cattle
that
are
after
all
the
most
reliable
form
of
transport
in
equatorial
africa
clad
in
red
blankets
or
loin
cloths
or
in
kilts
made
of
reeds
and
straw
they
struggle
on
singing
through
the
heat
grass
rings
temper
the
weight
of
the
loads
to
their
heads
each
man
carrying
his
forty
pounds
for
the
regulation
ten
miles
the
prescribed
day
march
in
the
tropics
winding
along
the
native
paths
they
go
chanting
a
weird
refrain
that
keeps
their
interest
and
makes
the
miles
slip
by
here
are
some
and
primitive
porters
from
the
mountains
shenzies
as
the
superior
swahili
call
them
and
clad
only
in
the
native
kilt
of
grass
or
reeds
good
porters
these
though
ugly
in
form
and
lacking
the
grace
of
the
wanyamwezi
or
the
wahehe
at
night
they
drop
their
loads
beside
the
that
mark
the
stages
in
the
long
march
and
seek
the
nearest
derelict
ox
or
horse
and
prepare
their
meals
with
relish
from
the
still
warm
entrails
this
with
their
pocha
the
allowance
of
mealie
meal
or
mahoga
keeps
them
fat
their
stomachs
distended
bodies
shiny
and
spirits
of
the
highest
round
their
camp
fires
they
chatter
far
into
the
night
relieved
by
the
number
of
the
troops
and
the
plentiful
supply
of
dead
horses
in
the
bush
from
the
fear
of
the
lion
that
in
other
days
would
lift
them
at
night
yelling
from
their
dying
fires
one
wonders
that
their
spirits
are
so
high
for
they
would
get
short
shrift
and
little
mercy
from
german
raiding
parties
behind
our
advance
for
the
porter
is
and
is
as
liable
to
destruction
as
any
other
means
of
transport
nor
would
the
germans
hesitate
a
moment
to
kill
them
as
they
would
our
horses
but
the
bush
is
the
porters
safeguard
and
at
the
first
scattering
volley
of
the
raiding
party
they
drop
their
loads
and
plunge
into
the
undergrowth
later
when
we
have
driven
off
the
raiders
it
is
often
most
difficult
to
collect
the
porters
again
naturally
the
british
attitude
to
the
porter
differs
from
that
of
the
hun
our
aim
indeed
is
to
break
up
an
enemy
convoy
but
we
seek
to
capture
the
hostile
porters
that
we
may
use
them
in
our
turn
all
the
more
welcome
to
us
for
the
increased
usefulness
that
german
porter
discipline
has
given
them
porters
are
the
sole
means
of
transport
of
the
german
armies
to
these
latter
are
denied
the
mule
transport
and
the
motor
lorries
that
eat
up
the
miles
when
roads
are
good
so
they
take
infinite
pains
to
train
their
beasts
of
burden
often
they
are
chained
together
in
little
groups
to
prevent
them
discarding
their
loads
and
plunging
into
the
jungle
when
our
pursuit
draws
near
the
german
knows
the
value
of
song
to
help
the
weary
miles
to
pass
and
makes
the
porters
chant
the
songs
and
choruses
dear
to
the
native
heart
increasingly
important
these
carriers
become
as
the
rains
draw
near
and
the
time
approaches
when
no
wheels
can
move
in
the
soft
wet
cotton
soil
of
the
roads
nor
are
the
porters
altogether
easy
to
deal
with
very
delicate
they
often
are
when
moved
from
their
own
district
and
deprived
of
their
accustomed
food
dysentery
plays
havoc
in
their
ranks
for
the
baganda
find
the
rough
grain
flour
much
too
coarse
and
irritating
for
their
stomachs
so
our
great
endeavour
is
to
get
the
greatest
supply
of
local
labour
strange
to
say
it
is
here
that
our
misplaced
leniency
to
the
german
meets
its
due
reward
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
the
combatant
unless
he
be
caught
they
all
wear
khaki
the
only
difference
being
that
a
civilian
wears
pearl
buttons
the
soldiers
the
metal
military
button
with
the
imperial
crown
stamped
on
it
when
it
is
borne
in
mind
that
the
buttons
are
hooked
on
one
can
imagine
how
simple
it
is
to
transform
and
change
identity
nor
are
the
helmets
different
in
any
way
save
that
a
soldier
bears
the
coloured
button
in
the
front
but
as
this
also
unscrews
the
recognition
is
still
more
difficult
with
these
people
it
has
been
our
habit
to
send
them
back
to
their
alleged
civil
occupations
after
extracting
an
undertaking
that
they
will
take
no
further
active
or
passive
part
in
the
war
but
to
our
surprise
when
we
sought
for
labour
or
supplies
in
their
country
districts
we
found
that
we
could
obtain
neither
upon
inquiry
of
the
natives
we
learn
that
our
late
prisoners
are
conducting
a
campaign
of
intimidation
soon
in
a
year
we
shall
all
return
and
the
english
will
be
driven
out
if
you
labour
or
sell
eggs
woe
betide
you
in
the
day
of
reckoning
what
can
the
native
do
as
they
say
to
us
we
see
the
germans
returning
to
their
farms
just
as
they
were
before
the
missionaries
installed
in
their
mission
stations
again
what
are
we
to
believe
the
padre
and
his
job
how
often
in
this
war
has
not
one
pitied
the
army
chaplain
as
a
visitor
to
hospital
as
a
dispenser
of
charity
as
the
bearer
of
hospital
comforts
and
gifts
to
sick
men
as
an
indefatigable
organiser
of
concerts
as
the
cheerful
friend
of
lonely
men
he
is
doing
a
real
good
work
but
that
is
not
his
job
it
is
not
what
he
came
out
to
do
and
the
padre
willing
earnest
good
fellow
that
he
is
is
conscious
that
he
is
often
up
against
a
brick
wall
a
reserve
in
the
soldier
that
he
can
not
penetrate
the
fact
is
that
he
has
rank
and
that
robs
him
of
much
of
his
power
to
reach
the
private
soldier
but
he
must
have
rank
just
as
much
as
a
doctor
executive
authority
must
be
his
in
order
to
assert
and
keep
up
discipline
and
yet
there
is
the
constant
barrier
between
the
officer
and
the
man
doctors
know
and
feel
it
feel
that
in
the
officer
they
are
no
longer
the
doctor
now
however
great
changes
have
been
wrought
and
the
medical
officer
likes
to
be
called
doc
just
as
much
as
the
chaplain
values
the
name
padre
there
something
so
intimate
about
it
such
a
tribute
to
our
job
and
our
responsibility
and
the
trust
and
confidence
they
have
in
us
the
soldier
is
not
concerned
about
his
latter
end
all
that
troubles
him
about
his
future
is
the
billet
he
yearns
for
the
food
he
hopes
to
get
the
rest
he
is
sure
is
due
to
him
his
leave
and
the
time
when
how
he
longs
for
that
he
may
turn
his
sword
into
a
ploughshare
and
have
done
with
war
and
the
soldier
beastly
trade
of
course
in
little
matters
like
swearing
the
padre
is
wise
and
he
knows
what
tommy
adjective
is
worth
he
knows
that
tommy
is
a
simple
person
and
apt
to
reduce
his
vocabulary
to
three
wonderful
words
three
adjectives
which
are
impartially
used
as
substantives
adjectives
verbs
or
adverbs
that
is
all
the
earnest
young
chaplain
at
first
gasps
with
horror
at
the
flaming
words
and
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
heavens
opened
and
celestial
wrath
descended
on
these
poor
heads
but
he
soon
learns
that
these
little
adornments
of
the
english
mean
less
than
nothing
for
tommy
is
a
reverent
person
he
is
not
a
blasphemer
in
reality
he
is
gentle
infinitely
kind
incredibly
patient
extraordinarily
generous
if
the
truth
be
told
his
language
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
his
soul
is
entirely
lost
but
when
one
knows
what
this
careless
generous
and
kindly
person
is
capable
of
one
feels
that
his
soul
is
a
very
precious
thing
indeed
and
there
is
one
way
the
padre
can
touch
this
priceless
soul
that
is
by
serving
in
the
ranks
with
him
then
all
the
barriers
fall
all
the
reserve
vanishes
and
the
padre
comes
into
his
own
and
saves
more
souls
by
his
example
than
by
oceans
of
precept
there
he
finds
himself
he
has
got
his
real
job
at
last
among
the
south
african
infantry
brigade
that
did
that
wonderful
march
to
kondoa
irangi
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
a
month
in
the
height
of
the
rainy
season
were
fourteen
parsons
all
serving
in
the
ranks
as
private
soldiers
they
carried
a
wonderful
example
with
them
it
was
their
pride
that
they
were
the
cleanest
and
the
best
disciplined
men
in
their
respective
companies
no
fatigue
too
hard
no
duty
too
irksome
better
soldiers
they
showed
themselves
than
tommy
himself
of
a
bright
and
cheerful
countenance
particularly
when
things
looked
gloomy
they
were
ready
for
any
voluntary
fatigue
the
patrol
in
the
thick
bush
that
was
so
dangerous
fetching
water
quick
to
build
fires
and
make
tea
ready
to
help
a
lame
fellow
with
his
equipment
always
cheery
never
grousing
they
lived
the
life
of
our
lord
instead
of
preaching
about
it
for
the
padre
job
i
take
it
is
to
teach
the
men
the
right
spirit
to
send
them
to
war
as
men
should
go
to
assure
them
that
this
is
a
holy
fight
that
god
is
on
their
side
he
knows
that
tommy
if
he
speculates
at
all
upon
his
latter
end
does
so
in
the
pagan
spirit
the
spirit
that
teaches
men
that
there
is
a
special
heaven
for
soldiers
who
are
killed
in
war
that
the
manner
of
their
dying
will
give
them
absolution
for
their
sins
and
the
padre
knows
that
the
pagan
spirit
is
the
true
spirit
and
yet
he
may
not
say
so
he
may
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
sin
will
be
forgiven
by
sacrifice
for
that
is
old
testament
teaching
his
bishop
tells
him
that
he
must
not
trifle
with
this
heresy
but
he
must
inculcate
in
sinful
man
that
he
can
by
repentance
and
by
repentance
only
gain
absolution
for
past
misdeeds
and
the
chaplain
knows
tommy
and
he
knows
that
he
will
never
get
him
on
that
tack
he
knows
that
any
soldier
who
is
any
good
looks
upon
it
as
a
cowardly
mean
and
contemptible
thing
to
crawl
to
god
for
forgiveness
in
times
of
danger
when
they
never
went
to
him
in
days
of
peace
and
i
know
many
a
chaplain
who
is
with
the
soldier
in
this
belief
a
little
of
war
and
the
padre
very
soon
finds
his
limitations
to
begin
with
he
is
attached
to
a
field
ambulance
and
not
to
a
regiment
as
a
rule
the
only
time
he
sees
the
men
is
when
they
are
wounded
then
he
often
feels
in
the
way
and
fears
to
obstruct
the
doctor
in
his
job
so
all
that
is
left
is
going
out
with
the
party
at
night
showing
a
good
example
cool
in
danger
merciful
to
the
wounded
but
that
again
is
not
his
job
first
when
he
laid
aside
the
sad
raiment
of
his
calling
and
put
on
his
khaki
habiliments
of
war
he
thought
that
the
chief
part
of
his
job
was
to
shrive
the
soldier
before
action
and
to
comfort
the
dying
later
he
found
that
the
soldier
would
not
be
shriven
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
dying
need
no
comfort
very
soon
he
learnt
that
wounded
men
want
the
doctor
and
chiefly
as
the
instrument
that
brings
them
morphia
and
ease
from
pain
and
when
the
wound
is
mortal
god
mercy
descends
upon
the
man
and
washes
out
his
pain
how
should
he
need
the
padre
when
god
himself
is
near
early
in
his
military
career
the
young
ministers
of
the
gospel
were
provided
with
small
diaries
in
which
they
might
record
the
dying
messages
of
the
wounded
then
came
disillusion
and
they
found
the
dying
had
no
messages
to
send
they
are
at
peace
the
wonderful
peace
that
precedes
the
final
dissolution
and
all
they
ask
is
to
be
left
alone
so
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
men
with
imagination
men
like
furze
the
bishop
of
pretoria
saw
in
a
vision
clear
that
the
padre
job
lay
with
the
living
and
not
with
the
dying
that
he
could
point
the
way
by
the
example
of
a
splendid
life
with
the
soldier
far
better
than
by
a
hundred
discourses
as
an
officer
from
the
far
detachment
of
the
pulpit
thus
was
the
idea
conceived
and
so
was
the
experiment
carried
out
and
all
of
us
who
were
in
german
east
africa
can
vouch
for
the
splendid
results
of
these
excellent
examples
for
the
private
soldier
saw
that
his
handicapped
as
he
was
by
being
a
parson
could
know
his
job
and
do
his
job
as
a
soldier
better
than
tommy
could
himself
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
here
was
a
man
who
could
make
himself
intelligible
without
prefixing
a
flaming
adjective
when
he
asked
his
pal
to
pass
the
jam
here
was
a
a
real
good
fellow
too
who
could
give
an
order
and
point
a
moral
without
the
use
of
a
blistering
oath
a
man
who
was
a
man
cool
under
fire
ready
for
any
dangerous
venture
cheerful
always
never
grousing
always
generous
and
open
as
a
soldier
should
be
never
preaching
never
openly
praying
never
asking
men
to
do
what
he
would
not
do
himself
can
you
wonder
that
tommy
understood
and
understanding
copied
this
example
when
he
saw
a
man
inspired
by
some
inward
spirit
that
made
him
careless
of
danger
contemptuous
of
death
fulfilling
all
the
requirements
in
the
way
of
manhood
he
knew
quite
well
that
some
divine
inward
fire
upheld
this
once
despised
follower
of
christ
then
lo
the
transformation
first
the
oaths
grew
rarer
in
the
ranks
and
vanished
then
came
the
discovery
that
after
all
it
really
was
possible
to
conduct
a
conversation
in
the
same
language
as
the
soldier
used
at
home
with
his
wife
and
children
that
after
all
the
picturesque
adjectives
that
flavoured
the
speech
of
camps
were
not
necessary
that
there
was
really
no
need
for
two
kinds
of
speech
the
language
of
the
camp
and
the
language
of
the
and
the
process
of
redemption
was
very
curious
all
are
familiar
of
course
with
the
hymn
tunes
that
are
sung
by
marching
soldiers
tunes
that
move
their
female
relatives
and
amiable
elderly
gentlemen
to
a
quick
admiration
for
the
christian
soldier
all
know
too
that
could
the
admiring
throng
only
hear
the
words
to
which
these
hymn
tunes
were
sung
the
crowd
would
fly
with
fingers
to
their
ears
from
such
apparent
blasphemy
well
these
ballads
were
first
sung
at
the
padre
and
especially
at
the
padre
who
was
masquerading
as
a
soldier
and
when
the
soldier
saw
that
the
padre
could
see
the
jest
and
laugh
at
it
too
and
know
that
it
meant
nothing
then
he
felt
that
he
had
got
a
good
fellow
for
his
sky
pilot
can
you
wonder
that
the
soldier
spoke
of
his
padre
comrade
in
such
generous
terms
and
that
the
whole
tone
of
the
regiment
improved
the
men
were
better
soldiers
and
better
christians
too
there
is
one
trap
into
which
a
padre
falls
when
marching
with
a
regiment
provided
by
regulations
with
a
horse
he
is
often
unwise
enough
to
ride
alongside
his
marching
cure
of
souls
it
would
perhaps
do
him
good
if
he
could
hear
as
i
did
the
comments
of
two
scottish
sergeants
in
the
rear
our
lord
did
not
consider
it
beneath
him
to
ride
upon
a
donkey
but
this
man
of
god
needs
must
have
a
horse
how
is
it
that
i
do
get
close
to
the
good
fellows
on
board
the
ship
said
a
very
good
and
earnest
padre
to
me
why
do
these
of
mine
come
to
church
how
is
it
that
fellows
i
know
to
be
good
and
generous
and
kindly
are
yet
to
be
found
at
the
bar
in
the
when
my
service
is
on
why
is
it
that
the
decent
nice
fellows
are
professing
christians
and
some
of
the
fellows
who
are
my
most
regular
attendants
have
a
tenth
of
the
character
and
quality
and
charm
of
these
apparent
pagans
what
could
i
do
but
tell
him
the
truth
i
knew
him
well
and
felt
that
he
would
understand
most
fellows
i
said
do
come
to
church
because
if
they
good
and
decent
characters
they
hate
to
be
hypocrites
now
you
know
padre
in
this
improper
world
of
ours
that
many
men
are
sinners
by
that
i
mean
that
convention
describes
as
sinful
some
of
the
things
they
do
what
do
you
tell
us
when
we
go
to
early
chapel
in
the
morning
ye
that
do
truly
and
earnestly
repent
you
of
your
sins
and
are
in
love
and
charity
with
your
neighbours
and
intend
to
lead
a
new
life
draw
near
with
faith
and
take
this
holy
sacrament
well
then
can
you
conceive
that
such
a
state
of
mind
exists
in
an
otherwise
decent
man
that
he
finds
the
burden
of
his
sin
not
intolerable
as
he
should
do
but
that
he
hugs
that
special
sin
as
a
prisoner
may
hug
his
chains
that
his
sin
or
let
us
call
it
his
breach
of
the
conventions
of
society
is
the
one
dear
precious
thing
in
his
existence
at
the
present
moment
he
does
want
to
reform
or
to
lead
a
new
life
later
no
doubt
tire
of
this
sin
and
then
he
may
come
to
church
again
but
how
could
a
man
of
character
go
to
god
house
and
be
such
an
infernal
hypocrite
he
can
not
partake
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
any
more
when
he
is
in
that
state
of
mind
so
you
see
padre
it
is
often
the
honest
men
who
wo
be
hypocrites
that
wo
go
to
your
church
many
the
padre
that
used
to
drift
into
our
hospital
on
the
long
trek
to
morogoro
church
of
england
roman
catholics
presbyterians
and
those
who
look
after
the
fancy
religions
as
tommy
calls
them
by
that
term
is
designated
any
man
who
does
not
belong
to
either
of
the
above
three
one
such
fellow
came
to
our
mess
the
other
day
and
in
answer
to
our
query
as
to
the
special
nature
of
his
flock
he
answered
that
though
strictly
speaking
a
congregationalist
he
had
found
that
he
had
become
a
dealer
in
in
souls
as
he
called
it
he
kept
as
he
said
a
fatherly
eye
and
a
very
good
eye
too
that
we
could
see
on
dissenters
in
general
welsh
baptists
rationalists
and
all
the
company
of
queerly
minded
men
we
have
in
this
strange
army
of
ours
later
we
heard
that
he
had
brought
with
him
an
excellent
reputation
from
the
front
and
that
is
not
easy
to
acquire
from
an
army
that
is
hard
to
please
in
the
matter
of
professors
of
religion
for
all
prisoners
and
captives
the
missionaries
and
the
allied
civilians
released
from
tabora
have
the
usual
tale
to
tell
of
german
beastliness
of
white
men
forced
to
dig
roads
and
gardens
wheel
barrows
and
other
degrading
work
under
the
guard
of
native
soldiers
insulted
humiliated
degraded
before
the
native
askaris
at
the
instance
of
german
officers
and
in
charge
the
italian
working
in
the
roads
we
may
forget
all
this
it
is
in
keeping
with
our
soft
and
sentimental
ways
but
will
the
french
will
italy
forgive
there
will
be
no
weakness
there
when
the
day
of
reckoning
comes
all
this
we
had
from
the
commission
of
inquiry
in
morogoro
and
mombasa
that
sat
to
take
evidence
gentle
nurses
of
the
universities
english
mission
missionary
ladies
who
devoted
a
lifetime
in
the
service
of
the
huns
and
the
natives
in
german
east
locked
up
behind
barbed
wire
for
two
years
without
privacy
of
any
kind
constantly
spied
upon
in
their
huts
at
night
by
the
native
guard
always
in
terror
that
the
black
man
now
unrestrained
even
encouraged
by
his
german
master
should
do
his
worst
can
you
wonder
that
they
kept
their
poison
tablets
for
ever
in
their
pockets
that
they
might
have
close
at
hand
an
end
that
was
merciful
indeed
compared
with
what
they
would
suffer
at
native
hands
so
with
many
tears
of
relief
they
cast
friendly
death
into
the
bushes
as
the
askaris
fled
before
the
dust
of
our
approaching
columns
do
you
blame
gentle
sister
mabel
that
she
would
never
speak
to
any
hun
in
german
using
only
swahili
and
precious
little
of
that
far
worse
the
story
told
by
the
broken
indian
soldiers
prisoners
since
the
fight
at
jassin
left
abandoned
half
dead
with
dysentery
and
fever
by
the
germans
on
their
retreat
to
mahenge
a
commission
of
inquiry
held
by
british
officers
of
native
indian
regiments
elicited
the
facts
the
remains
of
two
double
companies
one
kashmiris
the
other
bombay
grenadiers
to
the
number
of
were
brought
to
morogoro
and
there
farmed
out
to
german
contractors
here
they
toiled
on
the
railway
clearing
the
land
bringing
in
wood
from
the
jungle
building
roads
half
starved
and
savagely
they
might
burn
with
fever
or
waste
their
feeble
strength
in
dysentery
it
made
no
difference
to
their
brutal
jailers
to
be
sick
was
to
malinger
in
german
eyes
so
they
got
kiboko
and
their
rations
reduced
because
forsooth
a
man
who
could
not
work
could
also
not
eat
to
kiboko
a
prisoner
of
war
and
an
indian
soldier
is
a
flagrant
offence
against
the
laws
of
war
but
to
the
contractor
there
were
no
laws
but
of
his
making
and
he
laid
on
thirty
lashes
with
the
rhinoceros
hide
kiboko
to
teach
these
coolies
not
to
sham
again
and
as
these
soldiers
lay
half
dead
with
fever
on
the
road
their
german
jailers
gave
orders
that
their
mouths
and
faces
be
defiled
with
filth
a
crime
unspeakable
to
a
moslem
will
the
mohammedan
world
condone
this
the
fruit
of
this
treatment
was
that
eighty
of
these
wretched
soldiers
died
and
were
buried
at
morogoro
but
these
prisoners
on
their
release
marching
through
the
streets
caught
sight
of
two
of
their
erstwhile
jailers
walking
in
freedom
and
security
and
going
about
then
daily
avocations
as
if
there
was
no
war
these
germans
had
of
course
told
our
provost
marshal
that
they
were
civilians
and
never
had
or
intended
to
take
part
in
the
war
so
these
two
men
on
their
word
the
word
of
a
prussian
mark
you
well
were
allowed
all
the
privileges
of
freedom
in
morogoro
one
of
them
dorn
by
name
a
hangdog
ruffian
owned
the
house
we
took
over
as
a
mess
and
tried
to
get
receipts
from
us
for
things
we
took
for
the
hospital
that
really
belonged
to
other
people
but
the
indian
soldiers
evidence
was
the
undoing
of
dorn
and
his
arrested
and
put
into
jail
they
were
sent
to
for
trial
by
on
the
evidence
how
the
guard
hoped
that
an
attempt
to
escape
would
be
made
such
an
attempt
as
was
so
often
the
alleged
reason
for
the
shooting
of
so
many
of
our
english
prisoners
the
sense
of
discipline
in
the
indian
troops
was
such
that
no
matter
how
great
the
temptation
to
avenge
a
thousand
injuries
and
the
unexampled
opportunity
offered
by
a
long
railway
journey
through
dense
bush
they
delivered
their
prisoners
safe
in
it
is
said
that
nothing
would
persuade
dorn
and
his
comrade
to
leave
the
safe
shelter
of
the
railway
truck
no
they
did
not
want
to
go
for
a
walk
in
the
bush
they
would
stay
in
the
truck
thank
you
no
matter
how
great
the
invitation
to
flight
was
offered
by
an
open
door
and
the
temporary
disappearance
of
the
guard
do
you
think
these
two
ruffians
will
get
the
rope
i
wonder
the
other
day
at
kissaki
the
germans
sent
back
ten
of
our
white
prisoners
infantry
captured
at
salaita
hill
marines
from
the
all
these
weary
months
the
huns
had
dragged
these
wretched
prisoners
all
over
the
country
and
yet
there
are
some
who
tell
us
that
the
german
is
not
such
a
hun
here
as
he
is
in
europe
the
fact
is
he
is
worse
if
possible
inconceivably
arrogant
and
cruel
at
first
incredibly
anxious
to
conciliate
our
prisoners
when
the
tide
had
turned
and
vengeance
was
upon
him
burning
by
fever
by
day
chilled
by
tropic
dews
at
night
these
poor
devils
had
been
harried
and
kicked
and
cursed
and
by
askaris
and
insulted
by
native
porters
all
that
long
retreat
from
moschi
to
kissaki
and
beyond
no
machelas
for
them
if
they
were
ill
no
native
hammocks
to
carry
them
on
when
their
poor
brains
cried
out
against
the
malaria
that
struck
them
down
in
the
noonday
sun
kicked
along
the
road
or
left
to
die
in
the
bush
these
the
only
two
alternatives
and
the
beasts
were
kinder
than
the
huns
they
at
least
took
not
so
long
to
kill
forced
to
do
coolie
labour
to
dig
latrines
for
native
soldiers
incredibly
humiliating
such
was
their
lot
many
of
them
died
by
the
roadside
many
died
for
want
of
medicine
there
was
no
lack
of
drugs
for
germans
but
there
was
need
for
economy
where
prisoners
were
concerned
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
keep
their
drugs
for
their
own
troops
who
could
tell
their
pressing
need
in
months
to
come
but
the
indomitable
ones
they
kept
and
keep
them
still
only
yesterday
they
released
the
naval
surgeon
captured
on
the
ship
in
did
he
get
the
treatment
that
custom
ordains
an
officer
should
have
or
did
he
also
dig
latrines
and
cook
his
of
dripping
meat
over
a
wood
fire
like
a
shenzy
native
i
leave
that
to
you
to
answer
how
could
we
tell
he
was
a
doctor
that
is
the
huns
excuse
he
only
had
a
blue
and
red
epaulet
on
his
white
drill
tunic
there
was
no
red
cross
on
his
arm
but
apparently
after
twenty
months
they
discovered
this
essential
fact
and
what
was
left
of
him
struggled
into
our
lines
under
a
white
flag
the
other
day
but
here
as
in
germany
not
all
the
huns
were
hunnish
some
there
were
who
cursed
lettow
and
the
war
in
speaking
to
the
prisoners
and
in
private
talks
professed
their
tiredness
of
the
whole
beastly
campaign
but
these
our
men
noticed
were
ever
the
quickest
to
strafe
always
the
first
to
rail
and
upbraid
and
strike
when
a
german
officer
was
near
fed
on
native
food
chewing
manioc
mahoja
for
their
flour
the
ground
their
bed
so
they
existed
but
ever
in
their
captive
hearts
was
the
knowledge
that
we
were
coming
on
behind
them
ever
the
thunder
of
our
guns
the
panic
flights
of
their
captors
timid
advances
from
native
soldiers
unabashed
tokens
of
conciliation
from
the
europeans
alternating
with
savage
punishment
this
was
meat
and
drink
indeed
to
them
cheerfully
they
endured
for
nemesis
was
at
hand
how
they
chuckled
to
see
the
german
officer
heavy
kit
cut
down
to
one
chop
box
native
orderlies
cut
off
fat
german
doctors
waddling
and
sweating
along
the
road
away
and
ever
away
to
the
south
for
the
hated
beefs
were
after
them
coming
down
relentlessly
from
the
north
even
a
lay
brother
brother
john
they
kept
until
the
other
day
and
their
prisoners
refused
to
receive
the
conciliatory
amelioration
of
their
lot
that
would
be
offered
one
day
to
be
for
no
apparent
reason
withdrawn
the
next
no
thank
you
we
do
want
extra
food
now
we
really
need
a
native
servant
now
we
will
still
do
our
own
fatigues
no
we
do
want
to
go
for
a
walk
we
really
been
without
all
these
things
for
so
long
that
we
do
miss
them
now
anyhow
it
wo
be
for
long
they
said
the
german
commandant
turned
away
furiously
after
the
rejection
of
his
olive
branch
for
he
knew
now
that
his
captives
knew
that
the
game
was
up
and
it
gave
him
food
for
thought
indeed
the
beasts
of
the
field
we
are
camped
for
the
present
on
the
edge
of
a
plateau
overlooking
a
vast
plain
that
stretches
a
hundred
miles
or
more
to
where
kilimanjaro
lifts
his
snow
peaks
to
the
blue
all
over
this
yellow
expanse
of
grass
relieved
in
places
by
patches
of
dark
bush
are
great
herds
of
wild
game
slowly
moving
as
they
graze
antelope
and
wildebeests
zebra
and
hartebeests
there
seems
no
end
to
them
in
this
sportsman
paradise
at
night
attracted
by
meat
that
hangs
inside
a
strong
and
hut
the
hyaenas
come
to
prowl
and
voice
their
hunger
and
disappointment
on
the
evening
air
the
general
impression
in
england
you
know
was
that
in
coming
to
east
africa
we
had
left
the
cold
and
damp
misery
of
flanders
for
a
most
enjoyable
we
were
told
that
we
should
spend
halcyon
days
among
the
preserves
return
laden
with
honours
and
large
stores
of
ivory
and
in
our
spare
moments
enjoy
a
little
campaigning
of
a
picnic
variety
against
an
enemy
that
only
waited
the
excuse
to
make
a
graceful
surrender
but
how
different
the
truth
to
us
with
the
advance
there
has
been
no
shooting
to
shoot
a
sable
antelope
and
of
course
we
have
trekked
through
the
finest
game
preserves
in
the
world
including
the
crown
prince
special
elephant
forests
is
to
ask
for
trouble
from
the
askari
patrol
that
is
just
waiting
for
the
sound
of
a
rifle
shot
to
bring
him
hot
foot
after
us
so
the
sable
antelope
might
easily
be
bought
by
very
unpleasant
sacrifice
all
shooting
at
game
even
for
food
except
on
most
urgent
occasions
is
strictly
forbidden
for
a
rifle
shot
may
be
as
misleading
to
our
own
patrols
and
outposts
as
it
would
be
inviting
to
the
hun
this
war
had
led
us
from
the
comparative
civilisation
of
german
plantations
to
the
wildest
swampiest
region
of
equatorial
africa
after
rain
the
roads
tell
the
story
of
the
wild
game
for
in
the
mud
are
the
big
slot
marks
of
elephants
and
lions
and
all
the
denizens
of
the
bush
but
at
the
bases
and
back
in
british
east
africa
where
there
are
no
lurking
german
askari
patrols
many
fellows
have
had
the
time
of
their
lives
with
the
big
game
afternoon
excursions
to
the
wide
plains
and
their
bush
where
the
wild
game
hide
and
graze
we
are
often
asked
how
we
manage
to
avoid
the
lions
and
the
other
wild
beasts
of
the
country
that
come
to
visit
the
thorn
bomas
that
protect
our
transport
cattle
at
night
strange
as
it
may
seem
we
do
not
have
to
avoid
them
for
they
do
not
come
for
us
or
for
the
natives
nor
yet
for
the
live
cattle
so
much
as
for
the
dead
mules
and
oxen
i
dare
say
there
have
never
been
so
many
white
and
black
men
in
a
country
infested
with
lions
who
have
suffered
so
little
from
the
beasts
of
the
field
as
we
have
in
the
first
place
the
advance
of
so
great
an
army
has
frightened
away
a
very
large
number
of
the
wild
game
all
that
have
stayed
are
the
larger
carnivora
like
the
hyaena
or
the
lion
and
they
are
a
positive
godsend
to
us
for
instead
of
attacking
our
sentries
and
patrols
at
night
as
you
might
imagine
they
are
the
great
scavengers
and
camp
cleaners
of
the
country
of
vultures
there
are
too
few
in
this
land
probably
because
the
blind
bush
robs
them
of
the
chance
of
spotting
their
prey
were
it
not
for
lions
and
hyaenas
we
should
be
in
a
bad
way
for
they
come
to
eat
all
our
dead
animals
all
the
wastage
of
this
army
the
tribute
our
transport
animals
are
paying
to
fly
and
to
for
in
spite
of
fairy
tales
about
lions
one
must
believe
the
unromantic
truth
that
a
lion
prefers
a
dead
ox
to
a
man
and
a
black
man
to
a
white
one
so
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
that
in
this
army
of
ours
of
at
least
men
i
have
only
had
two
cases
of
mauling
by
the
larger
carnivora
to
deal
with
and
such
cases
as
these
would
all
pass
through
my
hands
there
was
only
one
case
of
lion
mauling
and
that
a
cape
boy
who
met
a
young
cub
on
the
road
and
unwisely
ran
from
it
at
first
curiosity
attracted
this
animal
and
later
the
hunting
instinct
caused
him
to
maul
his
prey
so
they
brought
him
in
with
the
severe
that
sets
in
in
almost
all
cases
of
such
a
nature
for
the
teeth
and
claws
of
the
larger
carnivora
are
frightfully
infectious
this
cape
boy
died
in
hours
yet
one
other
case
was
that
of
an
officer
who
met
a
leopardess
with
cubs
in
the
bush
when
out
after
guinea
fowl
she
charged
him
and
he
gave
her
his
left
arm
to
chew
to
save
his
face
and
body
then
alarmed
by
his
yells
and
the
approach
of
his
companion
she
left
him
and
he
was
brought
one
hundred
miles
to
the
railway
but
he
was
in
good
hands
at
once
and
when
i
saw
him
the
danger
of
had
gone
and
he
was
well
upon
his
way
to
health
again
the
same
experience
have
we
had
with
snakes
the
hot
dry
dusty
roads
and
the
torn
scrub
abound
with
snakes
and
most
of
them
of
a
virulently
poisonous
quality
but
one
case
only
of
have
i
seen
and
that
a
native
the
fact
that
the
wild
denizens
of
the
field
and
forest
are
much
more
afraid
of
us
than
we
of
them
saves
us
from
what
might
appear
to
be
very
serious
menace
even
the
wounded
left
out
in
the
dense
bush
have
not
suffered
from
these
animal
pests
but
the
dead
of
course
have
often
disappeared
and
their
bleached
bones
alone
are
left
to
tell
the
story
one
might
think
that
the
hyaena
the
universal
scavenger
would
be
as
loathed
by
the
native
as
he
is
by
us
whose
dead
he
disinters
at
night
if
we
have
been
too
tired
or
unable
to
bury
our
casualties
deep
enough
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
hyaena
is
worshipped
by
one
very
large
tribe
in
east
africa
the
kikuyu
for
these
strange
people
have
an
extraordinary
aversion
to
touching
dead
people
so
much
so
that
when
their
own
relatives
seem
about
to
die
they
put
them
out
in
the
bush
with
a
small
fire
and
a
gourd
of
water
protected
by
a
small
erection
of
bush
against
the
sun
and
leave
the
hyaenas
to
do
the
rest
so
it
comes
about
that
this
beast
is
almost
sacred
and
a
white
man
who
kills
one
runs
some
danger
of
his
life
if
the
crime
is
discovered
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
hyaenas
in
the
kikuyu
country
are
far
bolder
than
in
other
parts
elsewhere
and
by
nature
the
hyaena
is
an
arrant
coward
here
however
he
will
bite
the
face
off
a
sleeping
man
lying
in
the
open
or
even
pull
down
a
woman
or
child
should
they
be
alone
elsewhere
he
only
lives
on
carrion
the
german
is
not
a
sportsman
as
we
understand
the
term
though
the
modern
young
german
who
apes
english
ways
comes
out
to
east
africa
occasionally
to
make
collections
for
his
ancestral
schloss
that
the
crown
prince
should
have
reserved
large
areas
for
game
preserves
speaks
for
this
modern
tendency
in
young
germany
the
average
german
is
not
keen
on
exercise
in
the
tropics
he
will
be
carried
by
sweating
natives
in
a
chair
or
hammock
where
englishmen
on
similar
errands
will
walk
and
shoot
upon
the
way
this
slothful
habit
leads
us
to
the
conviction
that
very
much
of
the
country
is
not
explored
as
it
should
be
and
i
have
been
told
by
prospectors
for
precious
minerals
who
were
serving
in
our
army
of
the
wonderful
store
of
mineral
deposits
in
german
east
africa
one
noted
prospector
who
fell
into
my
hands
at
handeni
could
so
little
forget
his
occupation
of
peace
in
this
new
reality
of
war
that
he
always
took
out
his
prospector
hammer
on
patrol
with
him
and
chipped
pieces
of
likely
rock
to
bring
back
to
camp
in
his
haversack
he
it
was
who
told
me
of
his
discovery
of
a
seam
of
anthracite
coal
in
the
bed
of
a
river
near
the
tanga
railway
on
picket
he
had
wandered
to
the
edge
of
the
ravine
and
fallen
over
struggling
for
life
to
save
himself
by
the
shrubs
and
growing
plants
on
the
face
of
this
precipice
he
eventually
found
his
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
on
the
top
of
a
small
avalanche
of
earth
judge
then
of
his
astonishment
when
looking
up
he
saw
that
his
fall
had
exposed
a
fine
seam
of
coal
this
discovery
alone
in
a
country
where
the
railway
engines
are
forced
to
burn
wood
fuel
or
expensive
imported
coal
from
durban
is
of
the
greatest
importance
the
experience
of
most
of
us
seemed
to
be
that
the
germans
in
the
piping
days
of
peace
preferred
elegant
leisure
in
a
hammock
and
the
prospect
of
cold
beer
beneath
a
mango
tree
to
the
sterner
delights
of
laborious
days
in
thickly
wooded
and
inaccessible
mountains
one
of
the
first
results
of
this
campaign
will
be
to
bring
the
enterprising
prospector
from
rhodesia
and
the
malay
states
to
what
was
once
the
schöne
of
the
german
colonial
enthusiast
but
big
game
hunting
except
a
man
hunts
for
a
living
as
do
the
elephant
poachers
in
mozambique
or
the
lado
enclave
soon
loses
its
savour
to
white
men
after
a
time
it
is
not
long
before
the
rifle
is
discarded
for
the
camera
by
men
who
really
care
for
wild
life
in
wilder
countries
herein
the
white
man
differs
from
the
savage
who
kills
and
kills
until
he
can
slay
no
longer
strange
it
is
to
think
that
farmers
and
planters
in
east
africa
so
soon
tire
of
big
game
hunting
that
they
do
not
trouble
even
to
shoot
for
the
pot
or
to
get
the
meat
that
is
the
ration
provided
for
their
native
labourers
but
employs
a
native
armed
with
a
rifle
and
a
few
cartridges
to
shoot
antelope
for
meat
to
one
in
whom
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
romance
is
not
dead
what
more
attractive
than
an
elephant
hunter
life
to
work
for
six
months
and
make
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
and
spend
the
proceeds
in
a
riotous
holiday
until
the
heavy
tropic
rains
are
over
and
the
bush
is
dry
again
but
few
realise
the
rare
qualities
that
an
elephant
hunter
must
have
he
must
be
extraordinarily
tough
quite
hardened
to
the
toil
and
diseases
of
the
country
knowing
many
native
tongues
largely
immune
from
the
fever
that
lays
a
white
man
low
many
marches
from
civilisation
and
hospitals
of
an
endurance
splendid
with
hope
to
dare
the
risk
and
courage
to
endure
the
toil
for
the
professional
elephant
hunter
is
now
by
force
of
circumstance
and
white
man
law
become
a
wolf
of
the
forest
and
the
hands
of
all
governments
are
against
him
he
must
mark
his
elephant
down
be
up
with
the
first
light
and
after
him
must
manoeuvre
for
light
and
wind
and
scent
to
pick
the
big
bull
from
the
sheltering
herd
of
females
if
the
head
shot
is
not
possible
the
lung
shot
or
stomach
shot
alone
is
left
and
six
hours
march
through
waterless
country
before
one
comes
up
with
the
elephant
resting
with
his
herd
is
not
the
best
preparation
for
a
shot
if
one
misses
one
may
as
well
go
home
another
eight
hours
back
to
water
but
if
you
hit
and
follow
the
bull
through
the
thorny
bush
you
do
not
even
then
know
whether
you
will
find
the
victim
if
however
you
find
traces
three
times
in
the
first
hour
or
see
the
blood
pouring
from
the
trunk
not
merely
blown
in
spray
upon
the
bushes
then
the
certain
conviction
comes
that
within
an
hour
you
will
find
your
kill
then
the
long
march
back
to
camp
all
food
and
water
and
the
precious
tusks
carried
by
natives
often
too
exhausted
at
the
end
to
eat
a
man
who
can
not
march
thirty
miles
a
day
and
fulfil
all
the
other
requirements
should
relegate
elephant
hunting
to
the
world
of
dreams
all
the
big
successful
elephant
poachers
are
well
known
most
of
them
are
english
some
of
them
are
boers
a
few
only
french
or
american
but
seldom
does
a
german
attempt
it
or
live
to
repeat
his
experience
far
better
to
shut
his
eyes
to
this
illicit
traffic
and
assist
these
strange
soldiers
of
fortune
to
get
their
ivory
to
the
coast
and
then
enjoy
the
due
reward
of
this
complaisant
attitude
the
birds
of
the
air
i
think
it
is
rather
a
pity
that
no
naturalist
has
studied
the
birds
of
german
east
africa
in
the
intimate
and
friendly
spirit
that
many
men
have
done
at
home
it
has
been
said
that
the
bright
plumage
of
central
african
birds
is
given
them
as
compensation
for
the
charm
of
song
that
is
a
monopoly
of
the
european
bird
that
this
is
the
case
in
the
damp
forests
and
swamps
and
reed
beds
along
the
rufigi
and
other
big
rivers
there
is
no
doubt
gaudy
parrots
and
iridescent
finches
flash
through
the
foliage
of
trees
along
the
mohoro
river
monkeys
slide
down
the
ropes
formed
by
parasitic
plants
that
hang
from
the
tree
branches
to
dip
their
hands
in
the
water
to
drink
only
to
flee
chattering
to
the
as
they
meet
the
gaze
of
apparently
slumbering
crocodiles
great
painted
butterflies
flit
above
the
beds
of
lilies
that
fringe
the
muddy
lagoons
the
hippopotamus
wallows
lazily
in
the
warm
sunlit
waters
here
it
is
true
is
the
equatorial
africa
of
our
schoolboy
dreams
and
the
birds
have
little
but
their
glittering
plumage
to
recommend
them
but
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
the
greater
portion
of
tropical
africa
certainly
all
that
is
over
five
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
which
constitutes
the
greater
part
of
the
country
with
the
exception
of
the
coast
region
is
not
at
all
true
to
the
picture
that
most
of
us
have
in
our
minds
for
the
character
of
the
interior
is
vastly
different
great
rolling
plains
of
yellow
grass
and
thorn
scrub
with
the
denser
foliage
of
deciduous
trees
along
the
here
indeed
you
may
find
birds
that
are
gifted
with
the
sweetest
of
songs
in
the
bed
of
the
morogoro
river
lives
a
warbler
who
sings
from
the
late
afternoon
until
dusk
and
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
birds
that
have
that
deep
contralto
note
the
jug
of
the
nightingale
and
there
are
little
wrens
with
drab
bodies
and
crimson
tails
that
live
beside
the
dwellings
of
men
and
pick
up
crumbs
from
the
doors
of
our
tents
and
hunt
the
rose
trees
for
insects
in
the
thorn
bushes
of
higher
altitudes
are
grey
finches
that
might
have
learnt
their
songs
beside
canary
cages
the
african
swallows
red
headed
and
red
backed
have
a
most
tuneful
little
song
they
used
to
delight
our
wounded
men
in
hospital
at
handeni
when
they
built
their
nests
in
the
roofs
of
this
german
jail
and
sang
to
reward
us
for
the
open
windows
that
allowed
them
to
feed
their
broods
of
young
in
the
mealie
fields
are
francolins
in
coveys
very
like
the
partridge
in
their
call
though
in
plumage
nearer
to
its
english
brother
there
too
the
ubiquitous
guinea
fowl
the
spotted
kanga
that
has
given
us
so
many
blessed
changes
of
diet
utters
his
strident
call
from
the
tops
of
big
thorn
trees
the
black
and
white
meadow
lark
is
here
but
the
khoran
or
lesser
bustard
of
south
africa
that
resembles
him
so
much
in
plumage
on
a
much
larger
scale
is
absent
the
brown
bustard
so
common
in
the
south
is
the
only
representative
of
the
turkey
tribe
that
i
have
seen
here
black
and
white
is
a
very
common
bird
colouring
black
crows
with
white
collars
follow
our
camps
and
bivouacs
to
pick
up
scraps
and
the
brown
kite
hawks
for
garbage
and
for
the
friendly
lizard
too
in
the
hospital
compound
one
night
as
i
lay
in
my
tent
looking
to
the
camp
fritz
our
little
ground
squirrel
that
lived
beneath
the
table
of
the
mess
tent
met
an
untimely
fate
from
a
big
white
owl
a
whirr
of
soft
owl
wings
to
the
ground
outside
my
tent
a
tiny
squeak
and
fritz
had
vanished
from
our
compound
too
vultures
of
many
kinds
dispute
with
lion
and
hyaena
for
the
carrion
of
dead
ox
or
mule
beside
the
road
of
our
advance
king
vultures
in
their
splendour
of
black
bare
red
necks
and
tips
of
white
upon
their
wings
lesser
breeds
of
brown
carrion
hawks
and
vultures
attend
our
every
camp
again
the
vulture
is
not
so
common
as
in
south
africa
for
here
it
is
blind
in
this
dense
bush
and
has
to
play
a
very
subsidiary
part
to
the
scavenging
of
lions
and
hyaenas
down
by
the
swamps
one
evening
we
shot
a
vulture
that
was
assisting
a
moribund
ox
to
die
true
we
did
not
mean
to
kill
him
for
we
owe
many
debts
of
gratitude
to
vultures
but
to
my
surprise
my
native
boy
seemed
greatly
pleased
lifting
the
big
black
tail
he
showed
me
the
white
soft
feathers
beneath
and
by
many
signs
appeared
to
indicate
that
these
feathers
were
of
great
value
then
i
looked
again
and
it
was
a
marabou
stork
my
boy
who
had
been
with
marabou
and
egret
poachers
in
the
swamps
and
of
the
lower
rufigi
knew
the
value
of
these
snowy
feathers
biting
flies
of
the
many
plagues
that
beset
this
land
of
africa
not
the
least
are
the
biting
flies
just
as
every
tree
and
bush
has
thorns
so
every
fly
has
a
sting
some
bite
by
day
only
some
by
night
and
others
at
all
times
even
the
ants
have
wings
and
drop
them
in
our
soup
as
they
resume
their
plantigrade
existence
once
again
the
worst
biter
that
we
have
met
in
the
many
that
lie
along
the
northern
railway
is
the
tsetse
fly
especially
was
he
to
be
found
at
a
place
called
same
and
during
the
long
trek
from
german
bridge
on
the
northern
railway
to
morogoro
in
the
south
at
one
place
there
is
a
belt
thirty
miles
wide
and
our
progress
was
perpetual
torture
unless
we
passed
that
way
at
night
for
the
sleeps
by
night
beneath
leaves
in
the
bush
and
only
wakes
when
disturbed
for
this
reason
we
drive
our
horses
mules
and
cattle
by
night
through
these
savage
and
pertinacious
to
a
degree
are
these
pests
and
their
bite
is
like
the
piercing
of
a
needle
simple
and
innocent
they
appear
not
unlike
a
house
fly
but
larger
and
with
the
tips
of
their
wings
crossed
and
folded
at
the
end
like
a
swallow
they
are
mottled
grey
in
colour
and
their
proboscis
sticks
out
straight
in
front
hit
them
and
they
fall
off
only
to
rise
again
and
attack
once
more
for
their
bodies
are
so
tough
and
resistant
that
great
force
is
required
to
destroy
them
they
are
infected
with
trypanosomes
a
kind
of
attenuated
worm
that
circulates
in
the
blood
but
fortunately
not
the
variety
that
causes
sleeping
sickness
at
least
we
believe
not
in
any
case
we
shall
not
know
for
eighteen
months
for
that
is
usually
the
latent
period
of
sleeping
sickness
in
man
their
bite
is
very
poisonous
and
frequently
produces
the
most
painful
sores
and
abscesses
but
if
they
are
not
lethal
to
man
they
take
a
heavy
toll
of
horses
mules
and
cattle
through
the
night
watches
droves
of
horses
remounts
for
brits
and
vandeventer
brigades
cattle
for
our
food
and
for
the
transport
mules
and
donkeys
pass
this
way
fine
sleek
animals
that
have
left
the
union
scarcely
a
month
before
carefully
washed
in
paraffin
in
a
vain
attempt
to
protect
them
from
flies
and
ticks
but
what
a
change
in
a
short
six
weeks
the
coat
that
was
so
sleek
now
is
staring
the
eye
quite
bloodless
the
swelling
below
the
stomach
that
tells
its
own
story
wasting
incredible
soon
these
poor
beasts
are
discarded
and
line
the
roads
with
dull
eyes
and
heavy
hanging
heads
we
may
not
shoot
for
firing
alarms
our
outposts
and
discloses
our
position
the
lions
and
hyaenas
that
this
war
has
provided
with
such
sumptuous
repasts
will
ring
down
the
curtain
a
horse
scream
in
the
bush
at
night
the
lowing
of
a
frightened
steer
a
rustling
of
bushes
and
these
poor
derelicts
half
eaten
by
the
morning
meet
the
indifferent
gaze
of
the
next
convoy
more
merciful
than
man
are
the
scavengers
of
the
forest
they
at
least
waste
no
time
at
the
end
strange
that
the
little
donkeys
should
alone
for
a
time
at
least
escape
the
fly
it
is
their
soft
thick
coats
that
defeats
the
searching
proboscis
but
after
rain
or
the
fording
of
a
river
their
protecting
coats
get
parted
by
the
moisture
and
the
fly
can
find
his
mark
in
the
skin
so
the
donkey
and
the
somali
mule
that
generations
of
fly
have
rendered
tolerant
to
the
trypanosome
are
the
most
reliable
of
our
beasts
of
burden
soon
these
too
will
go
in
the
approaching
rainy
season
and
then
we
shall
fall
back
on
the
one
universal
beast
of
burden
the
native
carriers
thousands
of
these
are
now
being
collected
to
march
with
their
head
loads
at
the
heels
of
our
advancing
columns
the
veterinary
service
is
helpless
with
animals
one
may
say
with
truth
that
the
commonest
and
most
frequently
prescribed
veterinary
medicine
is
the
revolver
certainly
it
is
the
most
merciful
large
doses
of
arsenic
may
keep
a
horse
alive
for
months
alive
but
robbed
of
all
his
life
and
fire
his
free
gait
replaced
by
a
shambling
walk
the
wild
game
more
especially
the
water
buck
and
the
buffalo
whose
blood
is
teeming
with
these
trypanosomes
but
who
from
generations
of
infection
have
acquired
an
immunity
from
these
parasites
keep
these
flies
infected
thus
one
can
not
have
domestic
cattle
and
wild
game
in
the
same
area
the
two
are
incompatible
and
shortly
the
time
will
come
as
certainly
as
this
land
will
support
a
white
population
when
the
wild
game
will
be
exterminated
and
will
bite
no
more
more
troublesome
because
more
widely
spread
are
the
large
family
of
mosquitoes
the
small
grey
and
quietly
persistent
carries
the
malaria
that
has
laid
our
army
low
larger
and
more
noisy
trumpets
his
presence
in
the
night
watches
but
the
mischief
he
causes
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
noise
he
makes
host
of
the
spirium
of
yellow
fever
is
also
here
but
happily
not
yet
infected
not
yet
but
it
may
be
only
a
question
of
time
before
yellow
fever
is
brought
along
the
railways
or
caravan
routes
from
the
congo
or
the
rivers
of
the
west
coast
where
the
disease
is
endemic
there
for
many
years
it
was
regarded
as
biliary
fever
or
blackwater
or
malaria
now
that
the
truth
is
known
a
heavier
responsibility
is
cast
upon
the
already
overburdened
shoulders
of
the
sanitary
officer
and
the
specialists
in
tropical
diseases
as
yet
uninfected
are
also
found
in
quantities
in
the
east
and
with
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
that
links
the
west
indies
and
caribbean
sea
where
yellow
fever
is
endemic
with
the
teeming
millions
of
china
and
india
may
materially
add
to
the
burden
of
the
doctors
in
the
east
living
a
bare
fourteen
days
as
he
does
infected
died
a
natural
death
in
the
old
days
during
the
long
voyage
round
the
horn
and
thus
failed
to
infect
the
eastern
coolie
who
would
in
turn
infect
these
brothers
of
the
west
indian
mosquito
fortunate
it
is
in
one
way
that
is
the
mosquito
of
lines
of
communication
of
the
bases
of
houses
and
huts
and
dwellings
of
man
rather
than
of
the
bush
our
fighting
troops
are
consequently
not
so
exposed
as
troops
on
lines
of
communication
for
this
blessing
we
are
grateful
for
lines
of
communication
troops
can
use
mosquito
nets
but
divisional
troops
on
trek
or
on
patrol
can
not
soon
we
shall
see
the
fighting
troops
line
up
each
evening
for
the
protective
application
of
mosquito
oil
for
where
nets
are
not
usable
it
is
yet
possible
to
protect
the
face
and
hands
for
six
hours
at
least
by
application
of
oil
of
citronella
camphor
and
paraffin
nor
is
this
mixture
unpleasant
for
the
smell
of
citronella
is
the
fragrance
of
verbena
from
shropshire
gardens
least
in
size
but
in
its
capacity
for
annoyance
greatest
perhaps
of
all
is
the
sand
fly
almost
microscopic
but
with
delicate
grey
wings
of
a
shape
that
titania
self
might
wear
they
slip
through
the
holes
of
mosquito
gauze
and
torment
our
feet
by
night
and
day
the
fever
they
leave
behind
is
yet
as
nothing
compared
to
the
itching
fury
that
persists
for
days
finally
there
is
the
by
no
means
the
least
unpleasant
of
the
tribe
and
with
an
iridescent
blue
body
he
is
very
similar
to
the
bluebottle
and
lives
in
huts
and
dwellings
but
his
ways
are
different
for
he
bites
a
hole
into
one
skin
usually
the
back
or
arms
and
lays
an
egg
therein
in
about
ten
days
this
egg
develops
into
a
fully
grown
larva
in
other
words
a
white
maggot
with
a
black
head
it
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
boil
until
one
squeezes
it
and
pushes
the
squirming
head
outside
but
woe
to
him
who
having
squeezed
lets
go
to
get
the
necessary
forceps
for
the
larva
leaps
back
within
promptly
dies
and
forms
an
abscess
often
i
have
taken
as
many
as
thirty
or
forty
from
one
man
it
is
a
melancholy
comfort
to
find
that
this
fly
is
no
respecter
of
persons
for
the
staff
themselves
have
been
known
to
become
affected
by
this
pest
with
the
flies
may
be
mentioned
as
one
of
the
minor
horrors
of
war
in
east
africa
one
of
the
little
plagues
that
are
sent
to
mortify
our
already
flesh
the
jigger
flea
as
if
there
were
not
already
sufficient
trials
for
us
to
undergo
an
unkind
providence
has
sent
this
pest
to
rob
us
of
what
little
enjoyment
or
elegant
leisure
this
country
might
afford
true
to
her
sex
it
is
the
female
of
the
species
that
causes
all
the
trouble
the
male
is
comparatively
harmless
lurking
in
the
dust
and
grass
of
camps
she
burrows
beneath
the
skin
of
our
toes
choosing
with
a
calculated
ferocity
the
tender
junction
of
the
nails
with
the
protesting
flesh
no
sooner
is
she
well
ensconced
therein
than
she
commences
the
supreme
business
of
life
she
lays
her
eggs
by
the
million
all
enclosed
in
a
little
sack
what
little
measure
of
sleep
the
mosquitoes
the
sand
flies
and
the
stifling
nights
have
left
us
this
relentless
parasite
destroys
for
her
presence
is
disclosed
to
us
by
itching
intolerable
then
the
skill
of
the
native
boys
is
called
upon
and
dusky
fingers
well
scrubbed
in
lysol
are
armed
with
a
safety
pin
to
pick
the
little
interloper
out
intact
curses
in
many
languages
descend
upon
the
head
of
the
unlucky
boy
who
fails
to
remove
the
sack
entire
for
the
once
broken
abscesses
and
blood
poisoning
may
result
and
one
toes
become
an
offence
to
surgery
all
is
well
if
a
drop
of
iodine
be
ready
to
complete
the
operation
but
the
poor
soldier
whose
feet
perforce
are
dirty
and
who
only
has
the
one
pair
of
socks
pays
a
heavy
penalty
to
this
little
flea
that
dying
still
has
power
to
hurt
dirt
and
the
death
of
this
tiny
visitor
result
in
painful
feet
that
make
of
marching
a
very
torture
so
great
a
pest
is
this
that
at
least
five
per
cent
of
our
army
both
white
and
native
are
constantly
incapacitated
hundreds
of
toenails
have
i
removed
for
this
cause
alone
nor
do
the
jiggers
come
singly
but
in
battalions
and
often
as
many
as
fifty
have
to
be
removed
from
one
wretched
soldier
feet
and
legs
so
we
hang
our
socks
upon
our
mosquito
nets
and
take
our
boots
to
bed
with
us
nor
do
we
venture
to
put
bare
feet
upon
the
ground
a
yell
in
the
sleeping
camp
at
night
some
damn
thing
bit
me
and
matches
are
struck
while
a
sleepy
warrior
hunts
through
his
blankets
for
the
soldier
ant
whose
great
pincers
draw
blood
or
lurking
centipede
or
scorpion
for
in
these
dry
hot
dusty
countries
these
nightly
visitors
come
to
share
the
warm
softness
of
the
army
blanket
next
morning
sick
and
shivering
they
come
to
show
to
me
the
hot
red
flesh
or
swollen
limb
with
which
the
night
wanderer
has
rewarded
his
involuntary
host
night
in
morogoro
there
nothing
quite
so
wideawake
as
a
tropical
night
in
africa
at
dawn
the
african
dove
commences
with
his
note
like
a
boy
blowing
over
the
top
of
a
bottle
one
bird
calling
to
another
from
the
palms
and
mango
trees
then
the
early
morning
songsters
wake
there
is
no
libel
more
grossly
unfair
than
that
which
says
the
birds
of
africa
have
no
song
the
yellow
weaver
birds
sing
most
beautifully
as
they
fly
from
the
feathery
tops
of
the
avenue
of
coconut
palms
that
line
the
road
to
the
clump
of
bamboos
behind
the
hospital
but
they
fly
there
no
longer
now
for
our
colonel
in
a
spasm
of
sanitation
cut
down
this
graceful
swaying
clump
of
striped
bamboos
for
the
fear
that
they
harboured
mosquitoes
as
if
these
few
canes
mattered
when
our
hospital
was
on
the
banks
of
the
river
morning
songsters
with
voices
of
english
thrushes
and
robins
wake
one
to
gaze
upon
the
dawn
through
one
mosquito
net
small
bird
voices
like
the
in
may
carry
on
the
chorus
until
the
sun
rises
then
the
bird
of
delirium
arrives
and
runs
up
the
scale
to
a
high
monotonous
note
that
would
drive
one
mad
were
it
not
that
he
and
the
dove
with
his
amphoric
note
are
africa
all
over
a
neat
bird
this
with
a
long
tail
and
dark
markings
on
his
wings
then
as
the
sun
rises
and
the
early
morning
heat
dries
up
the
song
birds
voices
the
earth
and
the
life
of
the
palm
trees
drowse
in
the
sunshine
but
at
night
from
late
afternoon
to
three
in
the
morning
when
the
life
of
trees
and
grasses
and
ponds
ceases
for
a
short
while
before
it
begins
again
at
dawn
the
air
is
full
of
the
busy
voices
of
the
insect
world
until
we
came
south
to
morogoro
to
the
land
of
mangoes
coconut
palms
bamboos
we
had
known
the
shrill
voice
of
cicadas
and
the
harsh
metallic
noises
of
crickets
in
grass
and
trees
but
here
we
made
two
new
acquaintances
and
charming
little
voices
they
had
too
one
lived
in
the
grass
and
rose
leaves
of
our
garden
for
the
german
blacksmith
who
lately
occupied
our
hospital
building
had
planted
his
garden
with
caroline
testout
and
crimson
ramblers
his
voice
was
like
the
tinkling
of
fairy
hammers
upon
a
silver
anvil
and
with
this
fine
clear
note
was
the
elusive
voice
of
another
cricket
that
had
such
a
marked
ventriloquial
character
that
we
could
never
tell
whether
he
lived
in
the
rose
bushes
or
in
the
trees
his
note
was
the
music
of
silver
bells
upon
the
naked
feet
of
rickshaw
boys
the
tinkle
that
keeps
time
to
the
soft
padding
of
native
feet
in
the
rickshaws
of
nairobi
at
night
at
first
i
woke
to
think
there
were
rickshaw
boys
dragging
carriages
along
the
avenues
of
the
town
until
i
found
that
morogoro
boasted
no
rickshaws
and
no
bells
for
native
feet
punctuated
in
all
the
music
of
fairy
bands
and
the
whirr
of
fairy
machinery
were
the
incessant
voices
of
frogs
especially
if
it
had
rained
or
were
going
to
rain
the
little
frogs
in
trees
and
ponds
sang
their
love
songs
in
chorus
silenced
at
times
by
the
deep
basso
of
a
bull
frog
and
often
as
our
heads
ached
and
throbbed
with
fever
at
night
we
felt
a
very
lively
sympathy
for
the
french
noblesse
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
are
said
to
have
kept
their
peasants
up
at
night
beating
the
ponds
with
sticks
to
still
the
strident
voices
of
these
frogs
with
it
all
there
is
a
rustling
overhead
in
the
feathery
branches
of
the
palms
in
the
cobwebby
spaces
among
the
leaves
that
give
the
bats
of
africa
a
home
a
twitter
of
angry
bat
voices
shrill
squeaks
and
flutters
in
the
darkness
then
stillness
of
a
sudden
and
the
ground
trembles
with
a
throbbing
as
a
convoy
of
motor
lorries
approaching
thunders
past
us
rumbling
over
the
bridge
and
out
into
the
darkness
driving
for
supplies
the
road
beside
the
hospital
was
the
old
caravan
route
that
ran
from
the
congo
through
central
africa
and
by
the
great
lakes
to
bagamoyo
by
the
sea
for
centuries
the
arab
slaver
had
brought
his
slave
caravans
along
this
path
it
may
have
been
fever
or
the
phantasies
of
disordered
subconscious
minds
half
awake
in
sleep
or
the
empty
night
thrilling
to
the
music
of
crickets
that
filled
our
minds
with
fancies
in
the
darkness
but
this
road
seemed
alive
again
for
this
smooth
surface
that
now
trembles
to
the
thunder
of
motor
lorries
seemed
to
echo
to
the
soft
padding
of
millions
of
slave
feet
limping
to
the
coast
to
fill
the
harems
or
to
work
the
clove
plantations
of
his
most
oriental
majesty
the
sultan
of
zanzibar
the
waters
of
turiani
halfway
between
the
usambara
and
the
central
railway
the
dusty
road
to
morogoro
crosses
the
turiani
river
in
the
woods
beside
the
river
the
tired
infantry
are
resting
at
the
edge
of
a
big
rock
pool
wisps
of
blue
smoke
from
dying
fires
tell
of
the
tea
that
has
washed
beef
and
biscuit
down
dry
and
dusty
throats
the
last
company
of
bathers
are
drying
in
the
sun
upon
the
rocks
necks
arms
and
knees
burnt
to
a
sepia
brown
the
rest
of
their
bodies
alabaster
white
in
the
sunshine
it
is
three
and
the
drowsy
heat
of
afternoon
has
hushed
the
bird
and
insect
world
to
sleep
only
in
the
is
the
sleepy
hum
of
bees
still
busy
with
the
flowers
and
the
last
twitter
of
soft
birds
voices
soft
river
laughter
comes
up
from
the
rocky
below
and
softened
by
the
distance
to
a
poignant
sweetness
the
sound
of
church
bells
from
mhonda
mission
floats
up
to
us
upon
the
west
wind
yesterday
only
saw
the
last
of
lettow
army
crossing
the
bridge
and
echoed
to
the
noise
of
the
explosion
that
blew
up
the
concrete
pillars
and
forced
our
pioneers
to
build
a
wooden
substitute
alas
for
the
schemes
of
our
general
the
bird
had
escaped
from
the
closing
net
and
lettow
was
free
to
make
his
retreat
in
safety
to
the
southern
railway
here
at
turiani
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
the
campaign
was
over
up
from
the
big
mission
at
mhonda
the
mounted
troops
swept
out
to
cut
off
the
german
retreat
all
unsuspected
they
had
made
flank
march
to
meet
the
eastern
flanking
column
and
cut
the
road
behind
the
german
force
in
a
pincer
grip
but
the
blind
bush
robbed
our
troopers
of
their
sense
of
direction
and
the
long
trek
through
waterless
bush
the
tsetse
fly
and
that
took
their
daily
toll
of
all
our
horses
reduced
the
speed
of
cavalry
to
little
more
than
a
walk
a
mistake
in
a
hill
in
a
country
that
was
all
hill
and
bush
and
the
elusive
lettow
slipped
out
to
run
and
hide
and
fight
again
on
many
another
day
scouting
of
the
many
aspects
of
this
campaign
none
perhaps
is
more
thrilling
than
life
on
the
forward
patrol
for
the
duty
of
these
fellows
is
to
go
forward
with
armed
native
scouts
far
in
advance
of
the
columns
to
find
out
what
the
germans
are
up
to
their
strength
and
the
disposition
of
their
troops
their
reports
they
send
back
by
native
runners
who
not
infrequently
get
captured
like
wolves
in
the
forest
they
live
months
often
elapsing
without
their
seeing
a
white
face
and
then
it
is
the
kind
of
white
man
that
they
do
not
want
to
see
every
man
hand
against
them
native
as
well
as
german
unable
to
light
fires
at
night
for
fear
of
discovery
sleeping
on
the
ground
creeping
up
close
for
in
this
bush
one
can
only
get
information
at
close
quarters
always
out
of
food
forced
to
smoke
pungent
native
tobacco
they
have
to
live
on
the
game
they
shoot
and
it
is
a
hundred
chances
to
one
that
the
shot
that
gives
them
dinner
will
bring
a
hun
patrol
to
disturb
the
feast
theirs
is
without
doubt
the
riskiest
job
in
such
a
war
as
this
here
is
the
story
of
a
night
surprise
as
it
was
told
me
the
long
trek
had
lasted
all
day
to
be
followed
by
the
fireless
supper
how
one
longs
for
the
hot
tea
at
night
and
the
deep
sleep
that
comes
to
exhausted
man
as
soon
as
he
gets
into
his
blankets
drowsy
sentries
failed
to
hear
the
rustling
in
the
thicket
until
almost
too
late
the
alarm
is
given
pickets
run
in
to
wake
their
sleeping
bwona
all
mixed
up
with
germans
the
intelligence
party
scattered
to
all
points
of
the
compass
leaving
their
camp
kit
behind
them
there
was
no
time
to
do
aught
but
pick
up
their
rifles
that
is
second
nature
and
fly
for
safety
to
the
bush
now
this
actual
surprise
party
was
led
by
one
laudr
an
oberleutnant
who
had
lived
for
years
in
south
africa
and
had
married
an
english
wife
laudr
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
shot
in
german
east
but
he
missed
that
night
and
my
friend
escaped
unharmed
the
five
shots
from
his
revolver
next
morning
cautiously
approaching
the
scene
of
last
night
encounter
he
found
a
note
pinned
to
a
tree
in
it
laudr
thanked
him
for
much
good
food
and
a
pair
of
excellent
blankets
and
regretted
that
the
light
had
been
so
bad
for
shooting
but
he
left
a
young
goat
tied
up
to
the
tree
and
my
friend
own
knife
and
fork
and
plate
upon
the
ground
another
story
this
resourceful
fellow
told
me
concerning
an
exploit
which
he
and
a
fellow
man
with
of
their
scouts
had
brought
off
near
arusha
they
had
been
sent
out
to
get
information
as
to
the
strength
of
an
enemy
post
in
a
strongly
fortified
stone
building
the
kind
of
half
fort
half
castle
that
the
germans
build
in
every
district
as
an
impregnable
refuge
in
case
of
native
risings
with
watch
towers
and
battlements
these
forts
are
after
the
style
of
mediæval
buildings
equipped
with
food
supplies
and
a
well
they
can
resist
any
attack
short
of
artillery
learning
from
the
natives
that
the
force
consisted
of
two
german
officers
and
about
sixty
askaris
my
friend
determined
not
to
send
back
for
the
column
that
was
waiting
to
march
from
arusha
to
invest
the
place
between
them
they
resolved
to
take
the
place
by
strategy
and
guile
lying
hid
in
the
bush
they
arranged
with
friendly
natives
to
supply
the
guard
with
pombe
the
potent
native
drink
late
that
night
judging
from
the
sounds
that
the
kaffir
beer
had
done
its
work
they
crept
up
and
disarmed
the
guard
holding
the
outer
gate
they
sent
in
word
to
the
commandant
a
major
schneider
the
administrator
of
the
district
to
surrender
he
duly
came
from
his
quarters
into
the
courtyard
accompanied
by
his
lieutenant
before
i
consider
surrender
he
said
tell
me
what
force
you
got
this
fort
is
surrounded
by
my
troops
that
is
enough
for
you
said
our
man
in
any
case
you
see
my
men
behind
me
and
if
you
do
up
they
fire
and
the
troops
natives
stepped
forward
with
levelled
rifles
the
next
morning
the
major
still
doubting
asked
to
see
the
rest
of
the
english
troops
and
on
being
informed
that
these
were
all
would
have
rushed
back
to
spring
the
mines
that
would
have
blown
the
place
to
pieces
but
the
intelligence
officer
had
not
wasted
his
time
the
previous
night
and
had
very
carefully
cut
the
wires
that
led
apparently
so
innocently
from
the
central
office
of
the
fort
my
friend
brought
this
major
a
man
of
great
importance
in
his
district
to
and
during
the
whole
journey
the
german
never
ceased
to
complain
that
bluffing
was
a
dishonourable
means
of
warfare
to
employ
on
yet
another
occasion
he
had
an
experience
that
taxed
his
tact
and
strength
to
the
utmost
in
the
course
of
his
work
he
seized
the
factory
near
arusha
that
a
certain
frau
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
was
carrying
on
the
enemy
used
to
shoot
wildebeest
and
preserve
it
by
canning
or
by
drying
it
in
the
sun
as
biltong
for
the
use
of
the
german
troops
my
friend
was
forced
to
burn
the
factory
and
then
it
became
his
duty
to
escort
this
very
practical
lady
back
to
our
lines
this
did
not
suit
her
book
at
all
with
tears
she
implored
him
to
send
her
to
her
own
people
she
would
promise
anything
cunningly
she
suggested
great
stores
of
information
she
might
impart
but
he
cared
not
for
her
weeping
and
ordered
her
to
pack
for
the
long
journey
to
arusha
then
tears
failing
her
she
sulked
and
refused
to
eat
or
leave
her
tent
but
this
found
him
adamant
finally
she
tried
the
woman
wiles
which
should
surely
be
irresistible
to
this
man
but
he
was
unmoved
by
all
her
blandishments
so
surprised
and
indignant
was
he
that
he
threatened
to
tell
her
husband
of
her
behaviour
when
he
should
catch
him
but
here
it
appears
he
made
a
false
estimate
of
the
value
of
honour
and
dishonour
among
the
huns
a
loyal
german
woman
she
exclaimed
laughing
is
allowed
to
use
any
means
to
further
the
interests
of
her
fatherland
my
husband
will
only
think
more
highly
of
me
when
he
knows
so
this
modern
galahad
of
ours
turned
away
and
ordered
the
lady
tent
to
be
struck
and
marched
her
off
taking
care
that
he
himself
was
far
removed
from
her
presence
in
the
caravan
what
fools
you
english
are
she
flung
back
at
him
as
he
handed
her
into
the
custody
that
would
safely
hold
this
dangerous
apostle
of
till
the
end
of
the
war
hunnishness
wearily
along
the
road
from
korogwe
to
handeni
toiled
a
little
company
of
details
lately
discharged
from
hospital
and
on
their
way
forward
to
division
behind
them
straggled
out
for
half
a
mile
or
more
their
line
of
black
porters
carrying
blankets
and
waterproof
sheets
arms
and
necks
and
knees
burnt
black
by
many
weeks
of
tropic
sun
carrying
rifle
and
cartridge
belts
and
with
their
helmets
reversed
to
shade
their
eyes
from
the
westering
sun
this
little
body
of
rhodesians
royal
fusiliers
and
south
africans
covered
the
road
in
the
very
loose
formation
these
details
of
many
regiments
affect
far
ahead
was
the
advance
guard
of
four
rhodesians
and
fusiliers
nothing
further
from
their
thoughts
than
war
for
they
were
thirty
miles
behind
division
they
were
suddenly
galvanised
into
action
by
the
sight
of
the
advance
guard
slipping
into
the
roadside
ditches
and
opening
rapid
rifle
fire
at
some
object
ahead
for
at
a
turn
of
the
road
the
advance
guard
perceived
a
large
number
of
askaris
and
several
white
men
collected
about
one
of
our
telegraph
posts
while
up
the
post
upon
the
cross
trees
was
a
white
man
busily
engaged
with
the
wires
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
tell
these
wary
soldiers
that
the
white
men
were
wearing
khaki
uniforms
of
an
unfamiliar
cut
and
the
mushroom
helmet
that
the
hun
affects
so
they
took
cover
in
the
ditches
and
opened
fire
especially
upon
the
german
officer
who
was
busily
tapping
our
telegraph
wire
down
with
a
great
bump
on
the
ground
dropped
the
startled
hun
and
the
askaris
fled
to
the
jungle
leaving
their
chop
boxes
lying
on
the
road
from
the
safe
shelter
of
the
bush
the
enemy
reconnoitred
their
assailants
and
taking
courage
from
their
small
numbers
proceeded
to
envelop
them
by
a
flank
movement
but
the
british
officer
in
charge
of
the
details
behind
knew
his
job
and
threw
out
two
flanking
parties
when
he
got
the
message
from
the
advance
guard
our
men
outflanked
the
outflanking
enemy
and
soon
as
pretty
a
little
engagement
as
one
could
hope
to
see
had
developed
finding
themselves
partly
surrounded
by
unsuspected
strength
the
germans
scattered
in
all
directions
leaving
a
few
wounded
and
dead
behind
upon
the
field
there
on
his
back
wounded
in
the
leg
and
spitting
fire
from
his
revolver
was
lying
the
german
officer
determined
to
sell
his
life
dearly
his
last
shot
took
effect
in
the
head
of
one
of
the
fusiliers
who
were
charging
the
bush
with
the
bayonet
up
went
his
hands
kamerad
mercy
and
our
officer
stepped
forward
to
disarm
this
chivalrous
prisoner
then
they
wired
forward
to
our
hospital
at
that
time
ten
miles
ahead
for
an
ambulance
and
proceeded
to
bury
their
only
casualty
and
the
dead
askaris
happening
to
be
on
duty
i
hurried
to
the
scene
of
this
action
in
one
of
our
ambulances
along
the
worst
road
in
africa
there
i
found
the
german
officer
an
oberleutnant
of
the
name
of
zahn
lying
by
the
roadside
gazing
with
frightened
eyes
out
of
huge
yellow
spectacles
we
dressed
his
wound
and
gave
him
an
injection
of
morphia
a
cigarette
and
a
good
drink
of
brandy
and
left
him
in
the
shade
of
a
baobab
tree
to
recover
from
his
fears
then
i
turned
toward
the
dividing
of
the
contents
of
captured
chop
boxes
that
was
being
carried
out
under
the
direction
of
the
officer
in
charge
on
occasions
such
as
these
the
men
were
rewarded
with
the
only
really
square
meal
they
had
often
had
for
days
for
the
hun
is
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
doing
himself
well
and
his
chopboxes
are
always
full
of
new
bread
chocolate
sardines
and
many
little
delicacies
i
stepped
forward
to
claim
the
two
red
cross
boxes
that
had
obviously
been
the
property
of
the
german
doctor
and
with
some
difficulty
for
no
soldier
likes
to
be
robbed
of
his
spoil
i
managed
to
establish
the
right
of
the
hospital
to
them
in
the
boxes
were
not
only
a
fine
selection
of
drugs
and
surgical
dressings
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
but
also
the
doctor
ammunition
and
such
ammunition
too
huge
cartridges
with
large
leaden
bullets
they
would
only
fit
an
elephant
gun
and
yet
this
was
the
kind
of
weapon
this
doctor
found
necessary
to
bring
to
protect
himself
against
british
soldiers
had
that
doctor
been
caught
with
his
rifle
he
would
have
deserved
to
be
shot
on
the
spot
nor
were
our
men
in
the
best
of
moods
for
they
had
seen
the
dead
fusilier
and
were
furious
at
the
wounds
these
huge
lead
slugs
create
the
orderlies
then
lifted
the
german
officer
tenderly
into
the
ambulance
and
the
prisoner
now
feeling
full
of
the
courage
that
morphia
and
brandy
give
beckoned
to
me
meine
uhr
in
meiner
tasche
he
said
pointing
to
his
torn
trouser
well
what
about
it
i
asked
again
he
mentioned
his
watch
in
his
pocket
and
looked
at
his
torn
trouser
do
you
suggest
i
said
sternly
that
a
british
soldier
has
taken
your
beastly
watch
no
no
not
for
worlds
he
exclaimed
i
merely
wish
to
mention
the
fact
that
when
i
went
into
action
i
had
had
a
large
gold
watch
and
a
large
gold
chain
and
much
gold
coin
in
my
pocket
and
now
he
said
behold
i
have
no
watch
or
chain
what
i
said
again
do
you
suggest
that
these
soldiers
are
thieves
no
not
at
all
but
when
i
was
wounded
the
soldiers
running
up
in
their
anxiety
to
help
me
and
dress
my
wound
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
run
up
to
bayonet
him
had
not
the
officer
intervened
for
this
swine
had
forfeited
his
right
to
mercy
by
emptying
his
revolver
first
and
then
surrendering
inadvertently
cut
away
my
pocket
in
slitting
up
my
trouser
leg
then
your
watch
i
continued
coldly
is
still
lying
on
the
field
or
if
a
soldier
should
discover
it
he
will
deliver
it
to
general
headquarters
from
whence
it
will
be
sent
to
you
sure
enough
that
evening
the
in
charge
of
the
rearguard
came
in
with
the
missing
watch
and
chain
later
we
learned
from
diaries
captured
on
german
prisoners
what
manner
of
brute
this
zahn
was
from
minden
to
morogodo
judge
of
my
surprise
when
one
morning
in
hospital
at
morogoro
a
fellow
walked
in
to
see
me
whose
face
reminded
me
of
times
two
years
back
when
i
was
in
the
prisoners
of
war
camp
at
minden
in
westphalia
he
showed
a
fatter
and
more
wholesome
face
certainly
he
was
clean
and
well
dressed
but
still
unmistakably
it
was
the
man
to
whom
i
used
to
take
an
occasional
book
or
chocolate
when
he
lay
behind
the
wire
of
the
inner
prison
there
it
ca
be
you
i
said
illogically
but
it
was
but
what
a
change
these
two
years
had
wrought
now
an
officer
in
the
royal
flying
corps
the
ribbon
of
the
military
cross
bearing
witness
to
many
a
risky
reconnaissance
over
the
rufigi
valley
but
then
a
dirty
mechanic
in
the
french
aviation
corps
and
a
prisoner
but
in
december
there
were
no
fat
or
clean
english
soldiers
in
german
prisons
and
as
i
looked
my
mind
went
back
to
a
wet
morning
when
the
german
sentry
back
being
turned
a
french
soldier
working
on
the
camp
road
dug
his
way
near
to
the
door
of
my
hut
and
still
digging
told
me
that
there
was
an
englishman
in
the
french
camp
who
wanted
particularly
to
see
me
so
that
afternoon
i
walked
boldly
into
the
french
camp
as
if
i
had
important
business
there
and
found
my
way
to
the
further
hut
there
lying
on
a
straw
mattress
incredibly
lousy
and
sandwiched
between
a
turco
from
morocco
and
a
senegalese
negro
soldier
i
found
a
white
man
who
jumped
up
to
see
me
and
was
extraordinarily
glad
to
find
that
his
message
had
borne
fruit
clad
in
the
tattered
but
still
unmistakable
uniform
of
a
french
artilleryman
three
months
beard
upon
his
face
with
white
cheeks
blue
nose
and
a
dreadfully
hunted
expression
stood
this
six
emaciated
feet
of
england
drawing
me
aside
to
a
sheltered
corner
he
told
me
his
story
how
despairing
of
a
job
in
our
flying
corps
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
he
had
joined
the
french
aviation
corps
as
a
mechanic
and
how
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
early
in
september
when
the
engine
of
his
aeroplane
failed
and
he
descended
to
earth
in
the
middle
of
a
marching
column
of
the
enemy
of
the
early
months
of
captivity
from
september
to
december
in
minden
he
told
me
many
things
he
and
all
the
others
lived
in
an
open
field
exposed
to
all
the
westphalian
winter
weather
with
no
blankets
nothing
but
what
he
now
wore
they
lived
in
holes
in
a
wet
clay
field
like
rats
and
like
rats
they
fought
for
the
offal
and
pigwash
on
which
the
german
jailors
fed
them
twice
a
day
now
he
had
been
moved
into
a
long
hut
open
on
the
inner
side
that
looked
to
the
enclosed
central
square
of
the
lager
but
well
enclosed
outside
by
a
triple
barbed
wire
fence
why
do
they
put
you
in
with
coloured
men
i
asked
as
i
looked
at
his
bedfellows
oh
that
because
i
an
englishman
you
know
he
said
when
i
came
here
the
commandant
finding
who
i
was
was
pleased
to
be
facetious
in
arms
glorious
he
chuckled
as
he
ordered
my
particular
abode
here
of
course
do
object
to
sleep
with
a
comrade
he
said
with
heavy
german
humour
and
i
wanted
to
tell
him
had
i
only
dared
that
i
rather
sleep
with
a
nigger
from
senegal
than
with
him
how
about
the
lice
i
said
for
it
was
not
possible
to
avoid
seeing
them
on
the
thin
piece
of
flannelette
that
was
his
blanket
oh
i
used
to
them
now
time
was
when
i
hunted
my
clothes
all
day
long
but
now
nothing
matters
in
fact
i
rather
think
they
keep
me
warm
so
i
was
quick
and
glad
to
help
in
the
little
way
i
could
not
that
there
was
much
that
i
could
do
but
i
at
least
had
one
good
meal
a
day
and
two
of
german
prison
food
but
he
had
only
three
bowls
of
stew
and
soup
lest
you
might
think
that
i
exaggerate
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
he
had
and
you
may
judge
what
manner
of
diet
it
was
for
a
big
englishman
five
ounces
of
black
bread
a
day
part
of
barley
and
part
of
potato
the
rest
of
rye
and
wheat
for
breakfast
a
pint
of
lukewarm
artificial
coffee
made
of
acorns
burnt
with
maize
no
sugar
sauerkraut
and
cabbage
in
hot
water
twice
a
day
occasionally
some
boiled
barley
or
rice
or
oatmeal
and
now
and
then
almost
by
a
miracle
so
rare
were
the
occasions
a
small
bit
of
horseflesh
in
the
soup
could
one
wonder
at
the
wolfish
look
upon
his
face
the
dreary
hopelessness
of
his
expression
and
on
this
diet
he
had
fatigues
to
do
but
on
those
days
of
hard
toil
there
was
also
a
little
extra
bread
and
an
inch
of
german
sausage
but
i
could
get
some
things
from
the
canteen
by
bribing
the
german
orderly
who
brought
our
midday
food
and
i
had
some
books
so
the
sun
shone
for
a
time
on
minden
nor
was
this
fellow
alone
in
these
unhappy
surroundings
there
with
him
were
english
civilian
prisoners
clerks
and
technical
and
engineering
instructors
who
once
taught
in
german
schools
and
worked
at
essen
or
in
the
shipyards
these
wretched
civilians
until
they
were
removed
to
ruhleben
were
not
in
much
better
case
but
they
might
at
least
sleep
together
on
indescribable
straw
palliasses
then
they
were
together
there
was
comfort
in
that
at
least
by
a
strange
turn
of
fortune
wheel
this
very
camp
was
placed
upon
the
site
of
the
battlefield
of
minden
when
as
our
guards
would
tell
us
an
undegenerate
england
fought
with
the
great
frederick
against
the
french
moved
to
another
camp
this
fellow
had
escaped
by
crawling
under
the
barbed
wire
on
a
dirty
wet
night
in
winter
when
the
sentry
had
turned
his
back
against
the
northern
gale
a
moral
disaster
all
the
army
is
looking
for
the
gunnery
lieutenant
time
indeed
may
soften
the
remembrance
of
the
evil
he
has
done
us
and
in
the
dim
future
when
we
get
to
we
may
even
relent
sufficiently
to
drink
with
him
but
now
just
halfway
along
the
dusty
road
from
handeni
to
morogoro
we
feel
that
there
no
torture
yet
devised
that
would
be
a
fitting
punishment
strange
how
frail
a
thing
is
human
happiness
that
the
small
matter
of
a
misdirected
shell
should
blight
the
lives
of
a
whole
army
and
tinge
our
thirsty
souls
with
melancholy
for
this
clumsy
projectile
that
left
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
with
the
intention
of
wrecking
the
railway
station
in
became
by
evil
chance
deflected
in
its
path
and
struck
the
brewery
instead
not
the
office
or
the
part
of
the
building
but
the
very
heart
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
the
precious
vats
and
machinery
for
making
beer
and
there
will
be
no
more
lager
in
german
east
africa
until
the
war
is
over
all
the
long
hot
march
from
kilimanjaro
down
the
pangani
river
and
along
the
dusty
thirsty
plains
we
had
all
been
sustained
by
the
thought
that
one
day
we
would
strike
the
central
railway
and
finding
some
sufficient
pretext
to
snatch
some
leave
would
swiftly
board
a
train
for
and
drink
from
the
fountain
of
east
africa
the
one
bright
hope
that
upheld
us
the
one
beautiful
dream
that
dragged
weary
footsteps
southward
over
that
waterless
thorny
desert
was
the
occupation
of
the
brewery
we
had
heard
its
fame
all
over
the
country
we
had
met
a
few
of
its
precious
bottles
full
at
the
coast
had
found
some
empty
in
the
many
german
plantations
we
had
searched
now
ichabod
is
written
large
upon
our
the
joy
of
life
departed
the
sparkle
gone
from
bright
eyes
that
longed
for
victory
and
as
king
regulations
have
it
alarm
and
consternation
have
spread
through
all
ranks
even
the
accompanying
news
of
the
tears
of
the
hun
population
in
at
this
wanton
destruction
failed
to
comfort
us
the
navy
were
very
nice
about
it
they
were
just
as
sorry
as
we
they
said
the
gunner
had
been
put
under
observation
as
a
criminal
lunatic
we
understood
but
they
had
just
come
from
zanzibar
and
every
one
knows
that
all
good
things
are
to
be
found
in
that
isle
of
clover
all
the
excuses
in
the
world
wo
give
us
back
our
promised
beer
again
the
angel
of
morogoro
standing
on
the
river
bridge
that
crossed
the
main
road
into
morogoro
was
a
slender
figure
in
the
white
uniform
of
a
nursing
sister
in
one
hand
a
tiny
union
jack
in
the
other
a
white
flag
do
shoot
she
cried
i
an
englishwoman
and
the
bearded
south
african
troopers
who
were
reconnoitring
the
approaches
to
their
town
stopped
and
smiled
down
upon
her
take
this
letter
to
general
smuts
please
it
is
from
the
german
general
von
lettow
and
handing
it
to
one
of
them
she
shook
hands
with
the
other
and
told
him
how
she
had
been
waiting
for
two
years
for
him
to
come
and
release
her
from
her
prison
for
this
nursing
sister
had
been
behind
prison
bars
for
two
years
in
german
east
africa
and
you
may
imagine
how
she
had
longed
for
the
day
when
the
english
would
come
and
set
her
free
this
was
sister
mabel
the
only
nursing
sister
we
had
in
morogoro
for
the
first
four
months
of
our
occupation
her
memory
lives
in
the
hearts
of
hundreds
of
our
wretched
soldiers
who
were
brought
with
malaria
or
dysentery
to
the
shelter
of
our
hospital
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
one
of
the
trained
english
nursing
sisters
of
the
english
universities
mission
in
german
east
africa
she
was
imprisoned
with
the
rest
of
the
allied
civil
population
of
that
german
colony
from
the
commencement
of
war
until
the
time
that
smuts
had
come
to
break
the
prison
bars
and
let
the
wretched
captives
free
she
had
had
her
share
of
insult
indignity
shame
and
at
the
hands
of
her
savage
gaolers
but
in
that
slender
body
lived
a
very
gallant
soul
and
that
gave
her
spirit
to
dare
and
courage
to
endure
so
when
we
occupied
morogoro
and
lettow
fled
with
his
troops
to
the
mountains
this
very
splendid
sister
gave
up
her
chance
of
leave
to
come
to
nurse
for
us
in
our
hospital
the
germans
had
failed
to
break
the
spirits
of
these
civilian
prisoners
and
they
had
full
knowledge
of
the
army
that
was
slowly
moving
south
from
kilimanjaro
to
redress
the
balance
of
unsuccessful
military
enterprise
in
the
past
one
can
imagine
the
state
of
mind
of
these
wretched
people
when
the
news
of
our
attack
on
tanga
in
arrived
when
they
heard
of
our
indian
troops
being
made
prisoners
at
jassin
and
saw
from
the
attitude
of
the
hun
that
all
was
well
for
german
arms
in
east
africa
then
when
nemesis
was
approaching
the
german
commandant
came
to
their
prison
to
make
amends
for
past
wrongs
i
am
desolated
to
think
he
unctuously
explained
that
you
ladies
have
had
so
little
comfort
in
this
camp
in
the
past
and
i
have
come
to
make
things
easier
for
you
now
the
english
government
he
continued
with
an
ingratiating
smile
have
now
begun
to
treat
our
prisoners
in
england
better
and
i
hasten
to
return
good
to
you
for
the
evils
that
our
women
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
your
government
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
would
you
like
native
servants
would
you
care
to
go
for
walks
but
these
brave
women
answered
that
they
had
done
without
servants
and
walks
for
two
years
now
and
they
could
endure
a
little
longer
what
do
you
mean
he
exclaimed
in
anger
by
a
little
longer
but
they
answered
nothing
and
he
knew
the
news
of
our
advance
had
come
to
them
within
their
prison
cage
would
you
care
to
nurse
our
wounded
soldiers
he
said
more
softly
sister
mabel
said
she
would
so
now
for
the
first
time
she
is
given
a
native
servant
carried
in
state
down
the
in
a
hammock
and
installed
in
the
german
hospital
in
morogoro
there
in
virtue
of
the
excellence
of
her
work
and
knowledge
she
was
given
charge
of
badly
wounded
german
officers
and
received
with
acid
smiles
of
welcome
from
the
german
sisters
to
her
at
the
evacuation
of
the
town
had
lettow
come
and
giving
her
a
letter
to
general
smuts
had
asked
her
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
the
german
woman
and
children
he
was
leaving
behind
him
to
our
tender
mercies
there
is
no
need
of
letters
to
ask
for
protection
for
german
women
she
told
him
you
know
how
well
they
been
treated
in
wilhemstal
and
mombo
but
he
insisted
and
she
consented
and
so
the
bearded
troopers
found
this
english
emissary
of
lettow
waiting
for
them
upon
the
river
bridge
back
came
general
smuts
answer
tell
the
women
of
morogoro
that
if
they
stay
in
their
houses
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
british
troops
nor
will
one
house
be
entered
if
only
they
stay
indoors
and
the
army
was
as
good
as
the
word
of
their
chief
for
no
occupied
house
not
one
german
chicken
not
a
cabbage
was
taken
from
any
german
house
or
garden
and
now
the
despised
and
rejected
english
sister
had
become
the
oberschwester
and
her
german
fellow
nursing
sisters
had
to
take
their
orders
from
her
but
she
exercised
a
difficult
authority
very
kindly
and
adopted
a
very
cool
and
distant
attitude
toward
them
but
there
was
one
thing
she
never
did
again
she
never
spoke
german
any
more
but
gave
all
her
orders
and
held
all
dealings
with
the
enemy
in
swahili
the
native
language
or
in
english
in
this
she
was
adamant
now
indeed
had
the
great
work
of
her
life
begun
for
into
those
four
months
she
crammed
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
always
full
to
overcrowding
never
less
than
patients
where
we
had
only
the
equipment
for
the
whole
hospital
looked
to
her
for
the
nursing
that
is
so
essential
in
modern
medicine
and
surgery
for
nurses
are
now
an
absolute
necessity
for
medical
and
surgical
work
of
modern
times
and
we
could
get
no
other
sisters
the
railway
was
broken
the
bridges
down
and
where
could
we
look
for
help
or
hospital
comforts
or
medical
necessities
we
had
pushed
on
faster
than
our
supplies
and
with
the
equipment
of
a
casualty
clearing
station
we
had
to
do
the
work
of
a
stationary
hospital
no
beds
save
those
we
took
over
from
the
german
hospital
no
sheets
nor
linen
can
one
wonder
that
she
was
everywhere
and
anywhere
at
all
homes
and
in
all
places
six
in
the
morning
found
her
in
the
wards
she
alone
of
all
of
us
could
find
no
time
to
rest
in
the
afternoon
a
step
upon
the
verandah
where
she
slept
beside
the
bad
pneumonias
and
fever
cases
found
her
always
up
and
ready
to
help
nor
was
her
job
finished
in
the
nursing
she
was
our
housekeeper
too
for
she
alone
could
run
the
german
woman
cook
could
speak
swahili
and
keep
order
among
the
native
boys
buy
eggs
and
fruit
and
chickens
from
the
natives
so
that
our
sick
might
not
want
for
the
essentially
fresh
foods
then
at
last
the
railway
opened
up
a
big
stationary
hospital
our
casualty
clearing
station
moved
further
to
the
bush
and
sister
mabel
work
was
done
but
there
was
no
elegant
leisure
for
her
when
she
arrived
at
the
coast
to
take
the
leave
she
long
had
earned
in
england
an
australian
transport
had
some
cases
of
meningitis
aboard
and
wanted
sisters
and
as
if
she
had
not
already
had
enough
to
do
took
her
with
them
through
the
sunny
south
atlantic
seas
to
the
home
that
had
not
seen
her
since
she
left
for
tropical
africa
five
weary
years
before
the
will
to
destroy
the
journey
from
morogoro
to
is
a
most
interesting
experience
a
perfect
object
lesson
in
the
kind
of
futile
railway
destruction
that
defeats
its
own
ends
for
lettow
and
his
advisers
said
that
our
long
wait
at
had
ruined
our
chances
complete
destruction
of
the
railway
and
of
all
the
rolling
stock
would
hold
us
up
for
the
valuable
two
months
until
the
rains
were
due
our
means
of
supply
all
that
time
would
be
perforce
the
long
road
haul
by
motor
lorry
by
mule
or
ox
or
donkey
transport
two
hundred
miles
from
the
northern
railway
lettow
bet
on
the
rains
and
the
completeness
of
the
railway
destruction
he
would
cause
but
he
bargained
without
his
visitors
little
did
he
know
the
resource
and
capacity
of
our
indian
sappers
and
miners
our
engineer
and
pioneer
battalions
they
threw
themselves
on
broken
culverts
and
wrecked
bridges
with
only
hand
tools
so
short
of
equipment
were
they
they
drove
piles
and
built
up
girders
on
heaps
of
sleepers
and
made
the
bridges
safe
again
saving
every
scrap
of
chain
every
abandoned
german
tool
making
shift
here
extemporising
there
bending
steel
rails
on
hand
forges
utilising
the
scrap
heaps
the
enemy
had
left
they
finally
won
and
brought
the
first
truck
through
in
triumph
in
six
weeks
but
the
first
carriage
was
no
pullman
car
it
exemplified
the
resource
of
our
men
and
illustrated
the
idea
that
proved
lettow
wrong
for
we
adapted
the
engines
of
ford
and
bico
motor
cars
and
motor
lorries
to
the
bogie
wheels
of
german
trucks
and
sent
a
little
fleet
of
motor
cars
along
the
railway
light
and
very
speedy
these
little
trains
sped
along
each
dragging
its
thirty
tons
of
food
and
supplies
for
the
army
then
miles
from
this
adaptation
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
to
fixed
rails
may
not
be
new
but
it
was
unexpected
by
lettow
and
the
german
engineers
left
it
a
little
too
late
they
panicked
at
the
last
and
destroyed
wholesale
but
without
intelligence
true
they
put
an
explosive
charge
into
the
cylinders
of
all
their
big
engines
and
left
us
to
get
new
cylinders
cast
in
scotland
they
blew
out
the
grease
boxes
of
the
trucks
but
their
performance
on
the
whole
was
amateurish
for
they
blew
up
with
dynamite
the
masonry
of
many
bridges
and
contented
themselves
that
the
girders
lay
in
the
river
below
but
this
was
child
play
to
our
sappers
and
miners
with
hand
jacks
they
lifted
the
girders
and
piled
up
sleepers
one
by
one
beneath
until
the
girder
was
lifted
to
rail
level
again
now
any
engineer
can
tell
you
that
the
only
way
to
destroy
a
bridge
is
to
cut
the
girder
this
would
send
us
humming
over
the
cables
to
glasgow
to
get
it
replaced
it
was
what
they
did
do
on
the
most
important
bridge
over
ruwu
river
but
in
their
anxiety
to
do
the
thing
properly
there
and
they
reckoned
four
months
hard
work
would
find
us
with
a
new
bridge
still
unfinished
they
forgot
the
old
deviation
an
old
spur
that
ran
round
the
big
span
that
crossed
the
river
and
lay
buried
in
the
jungle
growth
in
ten
days
we
had
opened
up
this
old
deviation
laid
new
rails
and
had
the
line
when
i
passed
down
the
line
we
took
the
long
way
round
by
this
track
and
left
the
useless
bridge
upon
our
right
much
method
but
little
intelligence
was
shown
in
the
destruction
of
the
railway
lines
for
they
often
failed
to
remove
the
points
contenting
themselves
with
removing
the
rails
and
hiding
them
in
the
jungle
the
german
engineers
must
have
wept
at
the
orgy
of
devastation
that
followed
blind
fury
alone
seemed
to
animate
this
scene
of
blind
destruction
at
and
ruwu
they
first
broke
the
middle
one
of
the
three
big
spans
and
ran
the
rolling
stock
engines
sleeping
cars
a
beautiful
ambulance
train
trucks
and
carriages
pell
mell
into
the
below
but
the
wreckage
piled
up
in
a
heap
feet
high
and
soon
was
level
with
the
bridge
again
so
they
broke
the
other
spans
and
ran
most
of
the
rest
of
the
rolling
stock
through
the
gaps
when
these
too
had
piled
up
they
finally
ran
the
remainder
of
the
rolling
stock
down
the
embankments
and
into
the
jungle
then
they
set
fire
to
the
three
huge
heaps
of
wreckage
and
the
glare
lit
the
heavens
for
nearly
a
hundred
miles
but
the
almost
uninjured
railway
trucks
that
had
run
their
little
race
down
embankments
into
the
bush
were
saved
to
run
again
into
morogoro
station
steamed
the
trains
with
the
german
lettering
and
freight
and
tare
directions
carefully
undisturbed
printed
on
their
sides
to
us
it
seemed
that
the
destruction
of
an
ambulance
train
that
had
in
the
past
relied
upon
the
red
cross
and
our
forbearance
was
cutting
it
rather
fine
and
putting
a
new
interpretation
upon
the
geneva
convention
the
germans
however
argue
that
the
english
are
such
swine
they
would
have
used
it
to
carry
supplies
as
well
as
sick
and
wounded
and
what
a
magnificent
railway
it
was
and
what
splendid
rolling
stock
they
had
steel
sleepers
big
heavy
rails
low
gradients
excellent
cuts
and
bridge
work
cuttings
through
rock
smoothed
as
if
by
sandpaper
and
crevices
filled
with
concrete
fine
concrete
gutters
along
the
curves
such
ballasting
as
one
sees
on
the
railway
nothing
cheap
or
flimsy
about
the
culverts
railway
stations
built
regardless
of
cost
and
the
possibility
of
traffic
stone
houses
and
roofed
with
soft
red
tiles
that
are
in
such
contrast
to
the
corrugated
iron
roofing
one
sees
in
british
east
africa
expensive
weighbridges
where
it
seemed
there
was
nothing
but
a
few
natives
with
an
occasional
load
of
mangoes
and
bananas
here
was
an
indifference
to
mere
dividends
at
every
point
evidence
abounded
of
a
lavish
display
of
public
money
through
a
generous
colonial
office
for
in
the
wilhelmstrasse
this
colony
was
ever
the
apple
of
their
eye
and
money
was
always
ready
for
east
african
enterprises
yet
the
planters
complain
just
as
planters
do
all
over
the
world
of
the
indifference
of
governments
and
the
parsimony
of
executive
officials
a
greek
rubber
planter
told
me
from
the
standpoint
of
an
intelligent
and
benevolent
neutrality
and
who
so
likely
to
know
the
meaning
of
benevolence
in
neutral
obligations
as
a
greek
that
the
government
charged
huge
freights
on
this
line
killed
young
enterprise
by
excessive
charges
gave
no
rebates
even
to
german
planters
and
in
other
ways
seemed
indifferent
to
the
fortunes
of
the
sisal
and
rubber
planters
true
they
built
the
railway
but
what
use
to
a
planter
to
build
a
line
and
rob
him
of
his
profits
in
the
freight
this
gentleman
of
ancient
sparta
frankly
liked
the
germans
and
found
them
just
and
he
was
in
complete
agreement
with
the
native
policy
that
made
every
black
brother
do
his
job
of
work
the
whole
year
round
at
a
rate
of
pay
that
fully
satisfied
this
greek
employer
views
on
the
minimum
wage
the
haven
of
peace
this
town
is
indeed
a
haven
of
peace
for
our
weary
soldiers
the
only
rest
in
a
really
civilised
place
that
they
have
had
after
many
hundreds
of
miles
of
road
and
forest
and
trackless
thirsty
bush
in
the
cool
wards
of
the
big
south
african
hospital
many
of
them
enjoy
the
only
rest
that
they
have
known
for
months
wrecks
are
they
of
the
men
that
marched
so
eagerly
to
kilimanjaro
nine
weary
months
before
months
of
heat
and
thirst
and
tiredness
of
malaria
that
left
them
burning
under
trees
by
the
roadside
till
the
questing
ambulance
could
find
them
of
dysentery
that
robbed
their
nights
of
sleep
of
dust
and
flies
and
savage
bush
fighting
and
now
they
lie
between
cool
sheets
and
watch
the
sisters
as
they
flit
among
the
shadows
of
cool
shaded
wards
only
a
short
three
months
before
and
this
was
the
kaiserhof
the
first
hotel
on
the
east
coast
of
africa
as
the
german
manager
with
loud
boastfulness
proclaimed
there
had
been
a
time
when
we
doctors
then
at
nairobi
and
living
in
comfortable
houses
had
blamed
the
men
for
drinking
unboiled
water
and
for
discarding
their
mosquito
nets
but
even
doctors
sometimes
live
and
learn
and
those
of
us
who
went
right
forward
with
the
troops
came
to
know
how
impracticable
it
was
to
carry
out
the
army
order
that
bade
a
man
drink
only
boiled
water
and
sleep
beneath
a
net
late
in
the
night
the
infantryman
staggers
to
the
camp
that
lies
among
thorn
bushes
hungry
and
tired
and
full
of
fever
how
then
could
one
expect
him
to
put
up
a
mosquito
net
in
the
darkness
in
a
country
where
every
tree
has
got
a
thorn
long
ago
the
army
mosquito
nets
have
adorned
the
prickly
bushes
of
the
waterless
deserts
tuck
your
mosquito
net
well
in
at
night
so
runs
the
army
order
but
what
does
it
profit
him
to
tuck
in
the
net
when
dysentery
drags
him
from
his
blanket
every
hour
at
night
from
the
verandah
of
the
hospital
the
soldier
sees
the
hospital
ship
all
lighted
up
at
night
with
red
and
green
lights
the
ship
that
going
to
take
him
out
of
this
infernal
climate
to
where
the
mosquitoes
are
uninfected
and
tsetse
flies
bite
no
more
and
there
are
no
regrets
that
the
rainy
season
is
commencing
and
this
is
no
longer
a
campaign
for
the
white
soldier
on
the
sunlit
slopes
of
wynberg
he
will
contemplate
the
white
sands
of
muizenberg
and
recover
the
strength
that
he
will
want
again
in
four
months
time
in
the
swamps
of
the
rufigi
now
the
time
has
come
for
the
black
troops
to
see
through
the
rest
of
the
rainy
season
to
sit
upon
the
highlands
and
watch
across
miles
of
intervening
swamp
the
tiny
points
of
fire
that
are
the
camp
fires
of
german
askaris
through
the
shady
streets
of
this
lovely
town
wander
our
soldier
invalids
in
their
blue
and
grey
hospital
uniforms
along
the
roads
neat
boulevards
immaculate
gardens
and
avenues
of
mangoes
and
feathery
palm
trees
along
the
sea
front
at
night
in
front
of
the
big
german
hospital
that
now
houses
our
surgical
cases
you
will
find
these
invalids
walking
past
the
cemetery
where
the
good
huns
sleep
sitting
on
the
beach
enjoying
the
cool
sea
breeze
that
sweeps
into
the
town
on
the
monsoon
imagine
the
loveliest
little
harbour
in
the
world
a
white
strip
of
coral
and
of
sand
groves
of
feathery
palms
graceful
shady
mangoes
huge
baobab
trees
that
were
here
when
vasco
da
gama
soldiers
trod
these
native
paths
and
among
them
fine
stone
houses
soft
roofs
verandahs
all
screened
with
mosquito
gauze
and
excellently
well
laid
out
and
you
have
nothing
is
left
of
the
old
arab
village
that
was
here
for
centuries
before
the
german
planted
this
sloping
coral
sands
where
arab
dhows
have
beached
themselves
for
ages
past
are
now
supporting
the
newest
and
most
modern
of
tropical
warehouses
and
wharves
electric
cranes
travelling
and
a
railway
goods
yard
that
takes
the
freights
of
hamburg
to
the
heart
of
central
africa
it
must
be
pain
and
grief
to
the
german
men
and
women
whom
our
clemency
allows
to
occupy
their
houses
throng
the
streets
and
read
the
daily
reuter
cablegram
to
see
this
town
the
apple
of
their
eye
defiled
by
the
dirty
english
the
hated
beefs
as
they
call
us
from
a
mistaken
idea
of
our
fondness
for
that
tinned
delicacy
but
the
soldiers
daily
swim
in
the
harbour
is
undisturbed
by
sharks
and
the
feel
of
the
soft
water
is
like
satin
to
their
bodies
not
for
these
spare
and
slender
figures
the
prickly
heat
that
torments
fat
and
beery
german
bodies
and
makes
anathema
to
the
hun
on
german
yachts
the
lucky
few
of
officers
and
men
are
carried
on
soft
breezes
round
the
harbour
and
outside
the
harbour
mouth
in
the
evening
coolness
arab
dhows
sail
lazily
over
the
blue
sea
from
zanzibar
if
one
could
dream
one
could
picture
the
corsairs
red
flag
and
the
picturesque
arab
figure
standing
high
in
the
stern
beside
the
tiller
and
fancy
would
portray
the
freight
of
spices
and
cloves
that
they
should
bring
from
the
plantations
of
pemba
and
zanzibar
but
there
are
no
dusky
beauties
now
aboard
these
ships
and
their
freight
is
rations
and
other
prosaic
things
for
our
troops
the
red
pirate
flag
has
become
the
red
ensign
of
our
merchant
marine
all
the
caravan
routes
from
central
africa
debouch
upon
this
place
and
bagamoyo
bismarck
looks
out
from
the
big
avenue
that
bears
his
name
across
the
harbour
to
where
the
ship
lies
on
her
side
further
on
he
looks
at
the
sunken
dry
dock
and
a
stranded
german
imperial
yacht
it
would
seem
as
if
a
little
blood
and
iron
had
come
home
to
roost
even
as
the
sea
birds
do
upon
his
forehead
the
grim
mouth
that
once
told
thiers
that
he
would
leave
the
women
of
france
nothing
but
their
eyes
to
weep
with
is
by
our
passing
motor
lorries
the
more
i
see
of
this
place
the
more
i
like
it
everything
to
admire
but
the
water
supply
the
sanitation
the
huns
and
hunnesses
and
a
few
other
beastlinesses
one
can
admire
even
the
statue
of
wissmann
the
great
explorer
that
looks
with
fixed
eyes
to
the
congo
in
the
eye
of
the
setting
sun
he
is
symbolical
of
everything
that
a
boastful
germany
can
pretend
to
for
at
his
feet
is
a
native
askari
looking
upward
with
adoring
eye
to
the
bwona
kuba
who
has
given
him
the
priceless
boon
of
militarism
while
with
both
hands
the
soldier
lays
a
flag
the
imperial
flag
of
germany
across
a
prostrate
lion
at
his
feet
putting
it
acrost
the
british
lion
as
i
heard
one
of
our
soldiers
remark
monumentum
requiris
as
the
latins
say
or
as
tommy
would
translate
if
you
want
to
see
a
bit
of
look
at
what
the
navy
has
done
to
this
blinking
town
the
governor
palace
where
is
it
the
bats
now
roost
in
the
roofless
timbers
that
the
shells
have
left
what
of
the
three
big
german
liners
that
fled
to
this
harbour
for
protection
and
painted
their
upper
works
green
to
harmonise
with
the
tops
of
the
palm
trees
and
thus
to
escape
observation
of
our
cruisers
ask
the
statue
of
bismarck
he
know
for
he
has
been
looking
at
them
for
a
year
now
the
lies
on
her
side
half
submerged
in
water
the
lies
beached
at
the
harbour
mouth
in
a
vain
attempt
to
block
the
narrow
entrance
and
keep
us
out
the
now
on
her
way
upon
the
high
seas
to
carry
valuable
food
for
us
and
maybe
to
be
torpedoed
by
her
late
owners
the
crowning
insult
that
this
ship
should
have
recently
been
towed
by
the
another
captured
prize
what
of
the
two
dry
docks
that
were
to
make
the
only
station
on
the
east
coast
one
lies
sunk
at
the
harbour
mouth
shortly
however
to
be
raised
and
utilised
by
us
the
other
in
the
harbour
sunk
too
soon
an
ineffectual
sacrifice
germans
and
their
womenfolk
crowd
the
streets
many
of
the
former
quite
young
and
obvious
deserters
the
latter
thick
of
body
and
thicker
of
ankle
walk
the
town
unmolested
not
one
insult
or
injury
has
ever
been
offered
to
a
german
woman
in
this
whole
campaign
but
these
victims
of
our
bow
and
spear
are
not
a
bit
pleased
the
calm
indifference
that
our
men
display
towards
them
leaves
them
hurt
and
chagrined
better
far
to
receive
any
kind
of
attention
than
to
be
ignored
by
these
indifferent
soldiers
what
a
tribute
to
their
charms
that
the
latest
hun
fashion
latest
in
but
latest
by
three
years
in
paris
or
london
should
provoke
no
glance
of
interest
on
sunday
mornings
one
feels
that
they
long
to
pose
as
martyrs
and
that
our
quixotic
chivalry
cuts
them
to
the
quick
there
have
been
many
bombardments
of
the
forts
of
this
town
and
huge
dugouts
for
the
whole
population
have
been
constructed
great
underground
towns
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
all
roofed
in
with
steel
railway
sleepers
no
wonder
that
many
of
the
inhabitants
fled
to
morogoro
and
tabora
what
a
wicked
thing
of
the
englander
to
shell
an
undefended
town
the
and
the
huge
gun
positions
and
the
maze
of
trenches
barbed
wire
and
emplacements
hewn
out
of
the
living
rock
of
course
to
the
teuton
mind
do
not
constitute
defence
but
you
must
not
think
that
we
have
had
it
all
our
own
way
in
this
here
for
in
zanzibar
harbour
the
masts
of
peep
above
the
water
a
mute
reminder
of
the
september
for
on
that
fatal
day
attested
to
by
sixteen
graves
in
the
cemetery
and
more
on
an
island
near
a
traitor
betrayed
the
fact
that
our
ship
was
anchored
and
under
repairs
in
harbour
and
the
rest
of
the
fleet
away
up
sailed
the
and
opened
fire
and
soon
our
poor
ship
was
adrift
and
half
destroyed
a
gallant
attempt
to
beach
her
was
foiled
by
the
worst
bit
of
bad
luck
she
slipped
off
the
edge
of
the
bank
into
deep
water
but
even
this
incident
was
not
without
its
splendid
side
for
the
little
patrol
tug
originally
captured
from
the
enemy
threw
itself
into
the
line
of
fire
in
a
vain
attempt
to
gain
time
for
the
to
clear
but
the
cruiser
sharp
stern
cut
her
to
the
and
sank
her
and
as
her
commander
swam
away
the
passed
hailed
and
threw
a
lifebuoy
can
we
give
you
a
hand
said
the
very
chivalrous
commander
of
this
german
ship
no
go
to
hamburg
said
our
hero
as
he
swam
to
shore
to
save
himself
to
fight
again
on
many
a
day
upon
another
ship
