do
not
call
you
comrades
you
who
did
what
i
only
dreamed
though
you
have
taken
my
dream
and
dressed
yourselves
in
its
beauty
and
its
glory
your
faces
are
turned
aside
as
you
pass
by
i
am
nothing
to
you
for
i
have
done
no
more
than
dream
your
faces
are
like
the
face
of
her
whom
you
follow
danger
the
beloved
who
looks
backward
as
she
runs
calling
to
her
lovers
the
huntress
who
flies
before
her
quarry
trailing
her
lure
she
called
to
me
from
her
she
flung
before
me
the
curved
lightning
of
her
shells
for
a
lure
and
when
i
came
within
sight
of
her
she
turned
aside
and
hid
her
face
from
me
but
you
she
loved
you
she
touched
with
her
hand
for
you
the
white
flames
of
her
feet
stayed
in
their
running
she
kept
you
with
her
in
her
fields
of
flanders
where
you
go
gathering
your
wounded
from
among
her
dead
grey
night
falls
on
your
going
and
black
night
on
your
returning
you
go
under
the
thunder
of
the
guns
the
shrapnel
rain
and
the
curved
lightning
of
the
shells
and
where
the
high
towers
are
broken
and
houses
crack
like
the
staves
of
a
thin
crate
filled
with
fire
into
the
mixing
smoke
and
dust
of
roof
and
walls
torn
asunder
you
go
and
only
my
dream
follows
you
that
is
why
i
do
not
speak
of
you
calling
you
by
your
names
your
names
are
strung
with
the
names
of

and
immortal
cities
termonde
and

dixmude
and

introduction
this
is
a
journal
of
impressions
and
it
is
nothing
more
it
will
not
satisfy
people
who
want
accurate
and
substantial
information
about
belgium
or
about
the
war
or
about
field
ambulances
and
hospital
work
and
do
not
want
to
see
any
of
these
things
across
a
temperament
for
the
solid
facts
and
the
great
events
they
must
go
to
such
books
as
powell
fighting
in
flanders
or
frank
fox
the
agony
of
belgium
or
souttar
a
surgeon
in
belgium
or
a
experiences
in
the
great
war
by
louise
mack
for
many
of
these
impressions
i
can
claim
only
a
psychological
accuracy
some
were
insubstantial
to
the
last
degree
and
very
few
were
actually
set
down
there
and
then
on
the
spot
as
i
have
set
them
down
here
this
is
only
a
journal
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
record
of
days
as
faithful
as
i
could
make
it
in
every
detail
and
as
direct
as
circumstances
allowed
but
circumstances
seldom
allow
and
i
was
always
behindhand
with
my
journal
a
week
behind
with
the
first
day
of
the
seventeen
four
months
behind
with
the
last
this
was
inevitable
for
in
the
last
week
of
the
siege
of
antwerp
when
the
wounded
were
being
brought
into
ghent
by
hundreds
and
when
the
fighting
came
closer
and
closer
to
the
city
and
at
the
end
when
the
germans
were
driving
you
from
ghent
to
bruges
and
from
bruges
to
ostend
and
from
ostend
to
dunkirk
you
could
not
sit
down
to
write
your
impressions
even
if
you
were
enough
to
want
to
it
was
as
much
as
you
could
do
to
scribble
the
merest
note
of
what
happened
in
your
but
when
you
had
made
fast
each
day
with
its
note
your
impressions
were
safe
far
safer
than
if
you
had
tried
to
record
them
in
their
flux
as
they
came
however
far
behind
i
might
be
with
my
journal
it
was
it
is
not
written
up
or
round
and
about
the
original
notes
in
my
it
is
simply
written
each
day
of
the
seventeen
had
its
own
quality
and
was
soaked
in
its
own
atmosphere
each
had
its
own
unique
and
incorruptible
memory
and
the
slight
lapse
of
time
so
far
from
dulling
or
blurring
that
memory
crystallized
it
and
made
it
sharp
and
clean
and
in
writing
i
have
been
careful
never
to
go
behind
or
beyond
the
day
never
to
add
anything
but
to
leave
each
moment
as
it
was
i
have
set
down
the
day
imperfect
or
absurd
impression
in
all
its
imperfection
or
absurdity
and
the
day
crude
emotion
in
all
its
crudity
rather
than
taint
its
reality
with
the
discreet
reflections
that
came
after
i
make
no
apology
for
my
many
errors
where
they
were
discoverable
i
have
corrected
them
in
a
footnote
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
wildly
wrong
i
may
have
been
about
kilometres
and
the
points
of
the
compass
and
the
positions
of
batteries
and
the
movements
of
armies
but
there
were
other
things
of
which
i
was
dead
sure
and
this
record
has
at
least
the
value
of
a
human
document
there
is
one
question
that
i
may
be
asked
why
when
you
had
the
luck
to
go
out
with
a
field
ambulance
corps
distinguished
by
its
gallantry
why
in
heaven
name
have
you
not
told
the
story
of
its
heroism
well
i
have
not
told
it
for
several
excellent
reasons
when
i
set
out
to
keep
a
journal
i
pledged
myself
to
set
down
only
what
i
had
seen
or
felt
and
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
and
it
was
my
misfortune
that
i
saw
very
little
of
the
of
the
corps
besides
the
corps
itself
was
then
in
its
infancy
and
it
is
its
infancy
its
irrepressible
whole
engaging
infancy
that
i
have
touched
here
after
those
seventeen
days
at
ghent
it
grew
up
in
all
conscience
it
was
at
furnes
and
dixmude
and
la
panne
after
i
had
left
it
that
its
most
memorable
deeds
were
done
a
and
this
story
of
the
corps
is
not
mine
to
tell
part
of
it
has
been
told
already
by
souttar
and
part
by
philip
gibbs
and
others
the
rest
is
yet
to
come

in
belgium
a
journal
of
impressions
in
belgium
after
the
painful
births
and
deaths
of
i
do
know
how
many
committees
after
six
weeks
struggling
with
something
we
imagined
to
be
red
tape
which
proved
to
be
the
combined
egoism
of
several
persons
all
desperately
anxious
to
get
to
the
front
and
desperately
afraid
of
somebody
else
getting
there
too
and
getting
there
first
we
are
actually
off
impossible
to
describe
the
mysterious
processes
by
which
we
managed
it
i
think
the
war
office
kicked
us
out
twice
and
the
admiralty
once
though
what
we
were
doing
with
the
admiralty
i
do
to
this
day
understand
the
british
red
cross
kicked
us
steadily
all
the
time
on
general
principles
the
american
snubbed
us
rather
badly
what
the
french
said
to
us
i
do
remember
and
i
ca
think
that
we
carried
persistency
so
far
as
to
apply
to
the
russian
and
the
japanese
many
of
our
scheme
perished
in
their
own
vagueness
others
vivid
and
adventurous
were
checked
by
the
first
encounter
with
the
crass
reality
at
one
time
i
remember
we
were
to
have
sent
out
a
detachment
of
stalwart
amazons
in
khaki
breeches
who
were
to
dash
out
on
to
the
reconnoitre
and
pick
up
the
wounded
and
carry
them
away
slung
over
their
saddles
the
only
difficulty
was
to
get
the
horses
but
the
author
of
the
scheme
who
had
bought
her
breeches
had
allowed
for
that
the
horses
were
to
be
caught
on
the
as
the
wounded
and
dead
dropped
from
their
saddles
the
amazons
were
to
leap
into
them
and
ride
off
on
this
system
remounts
were
also
to
be
supplied
whenever
a
horse
was
shot
dead
under
its
rider
an
amazon
was
to
dash
up
with
another
whose
rider
had
been
shot
dead
it
was
all
perfectly
simple
and
only
needed
a
little
organization
for
four
weeks
the
lure
of
the
kept
our
volunteers
dancing
round
the
war
office
and
the
red
cross
societies
and
for
four
weeks
their
progress
to
the
front
was
frustrated
by
lord
kitchener
some
dropped
off
disheartened
but
others
came
on
and
a
regenerated
committee
dealt
with
them
finally
the
thing
crystallized
into
a
motor
ambulance
corps
an
awful
sanity
came
over
the
committee
chastened
by
its
sufferings
and
the
volunteers
under
pressure
definitely
renounced
the
then
somebody
said
let
help
the
belgian
refugees
from
that
moment
our
course
was
clear
everybody
was
perfectly
willing
that
we
should
help
the
refugees
provided
we
relinquished
all
claim
on
the
wounded
the
belgian
legation
was
enchanted
it
gave
passports
to
a
small
private
commission
of
inquiry
under
our
commandant
to
go
out
to
belgium
and
send
in
a
report
at
ostend
the
commission
of
inquiry
whittled
itself
down
to
the
one
energetic
person
who
had
taken
it
out
and
before
we
knew
where
we
were
our
ambulance
corps
was
accepted
by
the
belgian
red
cross
only
we
had
not
got
the
ambulances
and
though
we
had
got
some
money
we
had
not
got
enough
this
was
really
our
good
luck
for
it
saved
us
from
buying
the
wrong
kind
of
motor
ambulance
car
but
at
first
the
blow
staggered
us
then
by
some
abrupt
incalculable
turn
of
destiny
the
british
red
cross
which
had
kicked
us
so
persistently
came
to
our
help
and
gave
us
all
the
ambulances
we
wanted
and
we
are
off
there
are
thirteen
of
us
the
commandant
and
haynes
and
bird
under
him
and
torrence
a
trained
nurse
and
midwife
who
can
drive
a
motor
car
through
anything
and
take
it
to
bits
and
put
it
together
again
janet
mcneil
also
an
expert
motorist
and
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
red
cross
emergency
nurses
grierson
foster
and
riley
and
two
chauffeurs
and
me
i
do
know
where
i
come
in
but
they
called
me
the
secretary
and
reporter
which
sounds
very
fine
and
i
am
to
keep
the
accounts
heaven
help
them
and
write
the
commandant
reports
and
toss
off
articles
for
the
daily
papers
to
make
a
little
money
for
the
corps
we
got
some
already
raised
by
the
commandant
report
and
appeal
that
we
published
in
the
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
i
sprinted
down
fleet
street
to
get
it
in
in
time
four
days
before
we
started
and
we
have
landed
at
ostend
i
confess
now
that
i
dreaded
ostend
more
than
anything
we
had
been
told
that
there
were
horrors
upon
horrors
in
ostend
children
were
being
born
in
the
streets
and
the
state
of
the
where
the
refugees
lived
was
unspeakable
i
imagined
the
streets
of
ostend
crowded
with
refugee
women
bearing
children
and
the
digue
covered
with
the
horrific
on
the
other
hand
ostend
was
said
to
be
the
safest
spot
in
europe
no
germans
there
no
zeppelins
no
bombs
and
we
found
the
planted
out
several
miles
from
the
town
almost
invisible
specks
on
a
vanishing
the
refugees
we
met
walking
about
the
streets
of
ostend
were
in
fairly
good
case
and
bore
themselves
bravely
but
the
town
had
been
bombarded
the
night
before
and
our
hotel
had
been
the
object
of
very
special
attentions
we
chose
it
the
terminus
because
it
lay
close
to
the
and
saved
us
the
trouble
of
going
into
the
town
to
look
for
quarters
it
was
under
the
same
roof
as
the
railway
station
where
we
proposed
to
leave
our
ambulance
cars
and
heavy
luggage
and
we
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
getting
rooms
for
the
whole
thirteen
of
us
there
was
no
sort
of
competition
for
rooms
in
that
hotel
i
said
to
myself
if
ostend
ever
is
bombarded
this
railway
station
will
be
the
first
to
suffer
and
the
hotel
and
the
railway
station
are
one
and
when
i
was
shown
into
a
bedroom
with
glass
windows
all
along
its
inner
wall
and
a
fine
glass
front
looking
out
on
to
the
platforms
under
the
immense
glass
roof
of
the
station
i
said
if
this
hotel
is
ever
bombarded
what
fun
it
will
be
for
the
person
who
sleeps
in
this
bed
between
these
glass
windows
we
were
all
rather
tired
and
hungry
as
we
met
for
dinner
at
seven
and
when
we
were
told
that
all
lights
would
be
put
out
in
the
town
at
we
only
thought
that
a
municipality
which
was
receiving
all
the
refugees
in
belgium
must
practise
economy
and
that
anyway
an
hour
and
a
half
was
enough
for
anybody
to
dine
in
and
we
hoped
that
the
commandant
who
had
gone
to
call
on
the
english
chaplain
at
the
grand
hôtel
littoral
would
find
his
way
back
again
to
the
peaceful
and
commodious
shelter
of
the
terminus
he
did
find
his
way
back
at
just
in
time
to
give
us
a
chance
of
clearing
out
if
we
chose
to
take
it
the
english
chaplain
it
seemed
was
surprised
and
dismayed
at
our
idea
of
a
suitable
hotel
and
he
implored
us
to
fly
instantly
before
a
bomb
burst
in
among
us
this
was
the
first
we
had
heard
of
the
bombardment
of
the
night
before
the
commandant
put
it
to
us
as
we
sat
there
whether
would
we
leave
that
at
once
and
pack
our
baggage
all
over
again
and
bundle
out
and
go
hunting
for
rooms
all
through
ostend
with
the
lights
out
and
perhaps
fall
into
the
harbour
or
stay
where
we
were
and
risk
the
of
a
bomb
and
we
were
all
very
tired
and
hungry
and
we
had
only
got
to
the
soup
and
we
had
seen
and
smelt
the
harbour
so
we
said
we
stay
where
we
were
and
risk
it
and
we
stayed
a
taube
hovered
over
us
and
never
dropped
its
bomb
when
we
compared
notes
the
next
morning
we
found
that
we
had
all
gone
soundly
to
sleep
too
tired
to
take
the
taube
seriously
all
except
our
two
chauffeurs
who
were
downright
annoyed
because
no
bomb
had
entered
their
bedroom
then
we
all
went
out
and
looked
at
the
little
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
fish
market
and
the
big
hole
in
the
hotel
garden
and
thought
of
bombs
as
curious
natural
phenomena
that
never
had
and
never
would
have
any
intimate
connection
with
and
for
five
weeks
ever
since
i
knew
that
i
must
certainly
go
out
with
this
expedition
i
had
been
living
in
black
funk
in
shameful
and
appalling
terror
every
night
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
saw
an
interminable
spectacle
of
horrors
trunks
without
heads
heads
without
trunks
limbs
tangled
in
intestines
corpses
by
every
roadside
murders
mutilations
my
friends
shot
dead
before
my
eyes
nothing
i
shall
ever
see
will
be
more
ghastly
than
the
things
i
have
seen
and
yet
before
a
ostend
this
strange
visualizing
process
ceases
and
i
see
nothing
and
feel
nothing
absolutely
nothing
until
suddenly
the
commandant
announces
that
he
is
going
into
the
town
by
himself
to
a
and
i
get
my
first
experience
of
real
terror
for
the
hats
that
the
commandant
buys
when
he
is
by
himself
there
are
no
words
for
them
this
morning
the
corps
begins
to
realize
its
need
of
discipline
first
of
all
our
chauffeurs
have
disappeared
and
can
nowhere
be
found
the
motor
ambulances
languish
in
inactivity
on
cockerill
wharf
we
find
one
chauffeur
and
set
him
to
keep
guard
over
a
tin
of
petrol
we
the
ambulances
ca
start
till
heaven
knows
when
and
so
first
lambert
our
emergency
nurse
then
i
regret
to
say
our
secretary
and
reporter
make
off
and
sneak
into
the
cathedral
we
are
only
ten
minutes
but
still
we
are
away
and
torrence
our
trained
nurse
is
ready
for
us
when
we
come
back
we
are
accused
bitterly
of
we
had
betrayed
the
inherent
levity
of
our
nature
the
day
before
on
the
boat
when
we
looked
at
the
sunset
then
the
secretary
and
reporter
utterly
intractable
wanders
forth
ostensibly
to
look
for
the
commandant
who
has
disappeared
but
really
to
get
a
sight
of
the
motor
ambulances
on
cockerill
wharf
and
torrence
is
ready
again
for
the
secretary
convicted
now
of
and
i
have
seen
no
commandant
and
no
motor
ambulances
and
no
wharf
unbearable
thought
that
i
may
never
absolutely
never
see
cockerill
wharf
it
is
really
awful
this
time
because
the
president
of
the
belgian
red
cross
is
waiting
to
get
the
thirteen
of
us
to
the
town
hall
to
have
our
passports
and
the
commandant
is
rounding
up
his
corps
and
ursula
dearmer
is
heaven
knows
where
and
lambert
only
somewhere
in
the
middle
distance
and
torrence
beautiful
eyes
are
blazing
at
the
of
it
all
things
were
very
different
at
the
hospital
where
she
was
trained
only
the
president
remains
imperturbable
for
after
all
this
fuming
and
fretting
the
president
is
quite
ready
himself
or
perhaps
the
town
hall
is
ready
and
we
all
stroll
about
the
streets
of
ostend
for
half
an
hour
and
the
commandant
goes
off
by
himself
to
buy
that
hat
it
is
a
terrible
but
after
all
he
comes
back
without
it
judging
it
better
to
bear
the
ills
he
has
very
leisurely
and
with
an
immense
consumption
of
time
we
stroll
and
get
photographed
for
our
passports
then
on
to
the
town
hall
and
then
to
the
military
depôt
for
our
and
then
to
the
hôtel
terminus
for
lunch
and
at
we
are
off
whatever
happens
whatever
we
see
and
suffer
nothing
can
take
from
us
that
run
from
ostend
to
ghent
we
go
along
a
straight
flat
highway
of
grey
stones
through
flat
green
fields
and
between
thin
lines
of
trees
tall
and
slender
and
delicate
trees
there
are
no
hedges
only
here
and
there
a
row
of
poplars
or
pollard
willows
is
flung
out
as
a
screen
against
the
open
sky
this
country
is
formed
for
the
very
expression
of
peace
the
straight
flat
roads
the
straight
flat
fields
and
straight
tall
trees
stand
still
in
an
immense
quiet
and
serenity
we
pass
low
flemish
houses
with
white
walls
and
red
roofs
their
green
doors
and
shutters
are
tall
and
slender
like
the
trees
the
colours
vivid
as
if
the
paint
had
been
laid
on
yesterday
it
is
all
unspeakably
beautiful
and
it
comes
to
me
with
the
natural
inevitable
shock
and
ecstasy
of
beauty
i
am
going
straight
into
the
horror
of
war
for
all
i
know
it
may
be
anywhere
here
behind
this
sentry
or
there
beyond
that
line
of
willows
i
do
know
i
do
care
i
can
not
realize
it
all
that
i
can
see
or
feel
at
the
moment
is
this
beauty
i
look
and
look
so
that
i
may
remember
it
is
it
possible
that
i
am
enjoying
myself
i
dare
not
tell
torrence
i
dare
not
tell
any
of
the
others
they
seem
to
me
inspired
with
an
austere
sense
of
duty
a
terrible
integrity
they
know
what
they
are
here
for
to
me
it
is
incredible
that
i
should
be
here
i
am
in
car
sitting
beside
tom
the
chauffeur
torrence
is
on
the
other
side
of
me
tom
disapproves
of
these
flemish
roads
he
can
not
see
that
they
are
beautiful
they
will
play
the
devil
with
his
tyres
i
am
reminded
unpleasantly
that
our
daimler
is
not
a
touring
car
but
a
motor
ambulance
and
that
these
roads
will
jolt
the
wounded
most
abominably
there
are
straggling
troops
on
the
road
now
at
the
nearest
village
all
the
inhabitants
turn
out
to
cheer
us
they
cry
out
anglais
and
laugh
for
joy
perhaps
they
think
that
if
the
british
red
cross
has
come
the
british
army
ca
be
far
behind
but
when
they
hear
that
we
are
belgian
red
cross
they
are
gladder
than
ever
they
press
round
us
it
is
wonderful
to
them
that
we
should
have
come
all
the
way
from
england
les
belges
somehow
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
dies
before
these
crowding
pressing
faces
we
pass
through
bruges
without
seeing
it
i
have
no
recollection
whatever
of
having
seen
the
belfry
we
see
nothing
but
the
canal
where
we
halt
to
take
in
petrol
and
more
villages
more
faces
and
more
troops
between
bruges
and
ghent
an
embankment
thrown
up
on
each
side
of
the
road
tells
of
possible
patrols
and
casual
shooting
it
is
the
first
visible
intimation
that
the
enemy
may
be
anywhere
a
curious
excitement
comes
to
you
i
suppose
it
is
excitement
though
it
does
feel
like
it
you
have
been
drunk
very
slightly
drunk
with
the
speed
of
the
car
but
now
you
are
sober
your
heart
beats
quietly
steadily
but
with
a
little
creeping
mounting
thrill
in
the
beat
the
sensation
is
distinctly
pleasurable
you
say
to
yourself
it
is
coming
now
or
the
next
minute
perhaps
at
the
end
of
the
road
you
have
one
moment
of
regret
after
all
it
would
be
a
pity
if
it
came
too
soon
before
we
even
begun
our
job
but
the
thrill
mounting
steadily
overtakes
the
regret
it
is
only
a
little
thrill
so
far
for
you
really
believe
that
there
is
any
danger
but
you
can
imagine
the
thing
growing
growing
steadily
till
it
becomes
ecstasy
not
that
you
imagine
anything
at
the
moment
at
the
moment
you
are
no
longer
an
observing
reflecting
being
you
have
ceased
to
be
aware
of
yourself
you
exist
only
in
that
quiet
steady
thrill
that
is
so
unlike
any
excitement
that
you
have
ever
known
presently
you
get
used
to
it
what
a
fool
i
should
have
been
if
i
had
come
i
would
have
missed
this
run
for
the
world
i
forget
myself
so
far
as
to
say
this
to
torrence
my
voice
sound
at
all
like
the
stern
voice
of
duty
it
is
the
voice
of
somebody
enjoying
herself
i
am
behaving
exactly
as
i
behaved
this
morning
at
ostend
and
can
not
possibly
hope
for
any
sympathy
from
torrence
but
torrence
has
unbent
a
little
she
has
in
fact
been
unbending
gradually
ever
since
we
left
ostend
there
is
a
softer
light
in
her
beautiful
eyes
for
she
is
not
only
a
trained
nurse
but
an
expert
motorist
and
a
daimler
is
a
daimler
even
when
it
an
ambulance
car
from
time
to
time
remarks
of
a
severely
technical
nature
are
exchanged
between
her
and
tom
still
up
till
now
nothing
has
passed
to
indicate
any
flagging
in
the
relentless
spirit
of
the
hospital
the
next
minute
i
hear
that
the
desire
of
torrence
heart
is
to
get
into
the
greatest
possible
danger
and
to
get
out
of
it
the
greatest
possible
danger
is
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
uhlans
i
feel
that
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
to
get
out
of
it
but
that
not
by
any
means
so
keen
on
getting
in
i
say
so
i
confess
frankly
that
i
afraid
of
uhlans
particularly
when
they
drunk
but
torrence
is
not
afraid
of
anything
there
is
no
german
living
drunk
or
sober
who
could
break
her
spirit
nothing
dims
for
her
that
shining
vision
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
she
does
not
know
what
fear
is
i
conceive
an
adoration
for
torrence
and
a
corresponding
distaste
for
myself
for
i
do
know
what
fear
is
and
in
spite
of
the
little
thrill
i
remember
distinctly
those
five
weeks
of
frightful
anticipation
when
i
knew
that
i
must
go
out
to
the
war
the
going
to
bed
night
after
night
drugged
with
horror
black
horror
that
creeps
like
poison
through
your
nerves
the
falling
asleep
and
forgetting
it
the
waking
morning
after
morning
with
an
energetic
and
lucid
brain
that
throws
out
a
dozen
war
pictures
to
the
minute
like
a
ghastly
cinema
show
till
horror
becomes
terror
the
hunger
for
breakfast
the
queer
almost
uncanny
revival
of
courage
that
follows
its
satisfaction
the
driving
will
that
strengthens
as
the
day
goes
on
and
slackens
its
hold
at
evening
i
remember
one
evening
very
near
the
end
the
sunday
evening
when
the
commandant
dropped
in
after
he
had
come
back
from
belgium
we
were
stirring
soup
over
the
gas
stove
in
the
scullery
you
could
imagine
a
more
peaceful
scene
when
he
said
they
are
bringing
up
the
heavy
siege
guns
from
namur
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
terrific
bombardment
of
antwerp
and
i
think
it
will
be
very
interesting
for
you
to
see
it
i
remember
replying
with
passionate
sincerity
that
i
would
rather
die
than
see
it
that
if
i
could
nurse
the
wounded
i
would
face
any
bombardment
you
please
to
name
but
to
go
and
look
on
and
make
copy
out
of
the
sufferings
i
can
not
help
i
and
i
would
and
that
was
flat
and
i
was
a
journalist
any
more
than
i
was
a
trained
nurse
i
can
still
see
the
form
of
the
commandant
rising
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
scullery
stove
and
in
his
pained
uncomprehending
gaze
and
in
the
words
he
utters
i
imagine
a
challenge
it
is
as
if
he
said
of
course
if
you
have
i
told
him
that
i
afraid
the
gage
is
thrown
down
on
the
scullery
floor
i
pick
it
up
and
that
is
why
i
am
here
on
this
singular
adventure
thus
for
the
next
three
kilometres
i
meditate
on
my
cowardice
it
is
all
over
as
if
it
had
never
been
but
how
can
i
tell
that
it
wo
come
back
again
i
can
only
hope
that
when
the
uhlans
appear
i
shall
behave
decently
and
this
place
that
we
have
come
to
is
ecloo
we
are
not
very
far
from
ghent
a
church
spire
a
few
roofs
rising
above
trees
then
many
roofs
all
together
then
the
beautiful
foreign
city
as
we
run
through
the
streets
we
are
followed
by
cyclists
cyclists
issue
from
every
and
pour
into
our
road
cyclists
rise
up
out
of
the
ground
to
follow
us
we
do
realize
all
at
once
that
it
is
the
ambulance
they
are
following
bowing
low
like
racers
over
their
they
shoot
past
us
they
slacken
pace
and
keep
alongside
they
shoot
ahead
the
cyclists
are
most
fearfully
excited
it
dawns
on
us
that
they
are
escorting
us
that
they
are
racing
each
other
that
they
are
bringing
the
news
of
our
arrival
to
the
town
they
behave
as
if
we
were
the
vanguard
of
the
british
army
we
pass
the
old
military
hospital
no
and
presently
arrive
at
the
flandria
palace
hotel
which
is
no
ii
the
cyclists
wheel
off
scatter
and
disappear
the
crowd
in
the
place
gathers
round
the
porch
of
the
hotel
to
look
at
the
english
ambulance
we
enter
we
are
received
by
various
officials
and
presented
to
madame
the
head
of
the
red
cross
nursing
staff
there
is
some
confusion
and
torrence
finds
herself
introduced
as
the
secretary
of
the
english
committee
successfully
concealed
behind
the
broadest
back
in
the
corps
which
belongs
to
grierson
i
have
time
to
realize
how
funny
we
all
are
everybody
in
the
hospital
is
in
uniform
of
course
the
nurses
of
the
belgian
red
cross
wear
white
linen
overalls
with
the
brassard
on
one
sleeve
and
the
red
cross
on
the
breasts
of
their
overalls
and
over
their
foreheads
on
the
front
of
their
white
linen
veils
the
men
wear
military
or
uniforms
we
had
never
agreed
as
to
our
uniform
and
some
of
us
had
had
no
time
to
get
it
if
we
had
agreed
assembled
in
the
vestibule
we
look
more
like
a
party
of
refugees
or
the
cast
of
a
barrie
play
than
a
field
ambulance
corps
grierson
the
chaplain
alone
wears
complete
khaki
in
which
he
is
indistinguishable
from
any
tommy
the
commandant
obeying
some
mysterious
inspiration
has
left
his
khaki
suit
behind
he
wears
a
norfolk
jacket
and
one
of
his
hats
foster
in
plain
clothes
with
a
satchel
slung
over
his
shoulders
has
the
air
of
an
inquiring
tourist
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
in
short
khaki
tunics
khaki
putties
and
round
jaeger
caps
and
very
thick
coats
over
all
strapped
in
with
leather
belts
look
as
if
they
were
about
to
sail
on
an
arctic
expedition
i
was
told
to
wear
dark
blue
serge
and
i
wear
it
accordingly
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
are
in
normal
clothes
but
the
amiable
officials
and
the
angelic
belgian
ladies
behave
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
odd
about
our
appearance
they
remember
only
that
we
are
english
and
that
it
is
now
six
and
that
we
have
had
no
tea
they
conceive
this
to
be
the
most
deplorable
fate
that
can
overtake
the
english
and
they
hurry
us
into
the
great
kitchen
to
a
round
table
loaded
with
cake
and
and
enormous
bowls
of
tea
the
angelic
beings
in
white
veils
wait
on
us
we
are
hungry
and
we
think
a
pardonable
error
that
this
meal
is
hospital
supper
after
which
some
work
will
surely
be
found
for
us
to
do
we
are
shown
to
our
quarters
on
the
third
floor
we
expect
two
bare
dormitories
with
rows
of
hard
beds
which
we
are
prepared
to
make
ourselves
besides
sweeping
the
dormitories
and
we
find
a
fine
suite
of
rooms
a
bedrooms
bathrooms
and
hospital
orderlies
for
our
de
we
unpack
sit
round
the
and
wait
for
orders
perhaps
we
may
all
be
sent
down
into
the
kitchen
to
wash
up
personally
i
hope
we
shall
be
for
washing
up
is
a
thing
i
can
do
both
quickly
and
well
it
is
now
seven
at
we
are
sent
down
into
the
kitchen
not
to
wash
up
but
if
you
will
believe
it
to
dine
and
more
hospital
orderlies
wait
on
us
at
dinner
the
desire
of
our
hearts
is
to
do
if
it
is
only
to
black
the
boots
of
the
angelic
beings
but
no
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
do
perhaps
the
doctors
and
will
be
busy
we
hear
that
only
five
wounded
have
been
brought
into
the
hospital
they
have
no
ambulance
cars
and
ours
will
be
badly
needed
but
no
we
go
out
into
the
town
to
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
and
sit
outside
the
café
and
drink
black
coffee
in
despair
we
find
our
chauffeurs
doing
the
same
thing
then
we
go
back
to
our
sumptuous
hotel
and
so
dejectedly
to
bed
aeroplanes
hover
above
us
all
night
we
hang
about
waiting
for
orders
they
may
come
at
any
moment
meanwhile
this
place
grows
incredible
and
fantastic
now
it
is
an
hotel
and
now
it
is
a
military
hospital
its
two
aspects
shift
and
merge
into
each
other
with
a
effect
it
is
a
huge
building
of
extravagant
design
wearing
its
turrets
its
balconies
its
very
roofs
like
so
much
decoration
the
gilded
legend
flandria
palace
hotel
glitters
across
the
immense
white
façade
but
the
red
cross
flag
flies
from
the
front
and
from
the
corners
of
the
turrets
and
from
the
balconies
of
the
long
flank
facing
south
you
arrive
under
a
porch
that
covers
the
smooth
slope
of
the
approach
you
enter
your
hotel
through
mahogany
revolving
doors
a
colossal
flora
stands
by
the
lift
at
the
foot
of
the
big
staircase
unaware
that
this
is
no
festival
of
flowers
the
poor
stupid
thing
leans
forward
smiling
and
holds
out
her
garland
to
the
wounded
as
they
are
carried
past
nobody
takes
any
notice
of
her
the
great
hall
of
the
hotel
has
been
stripped
bare
all
draperies
and
ornaments
have
disappeared
the
proprietor
has
disappeared
or
goes
about
disguised
as
a
red
cross
officer
the
grey
mosaic
of
floors
and
stairs
is
cleared
of
rugs
and
carpeting
the
is
now
a
secretarial
bureau
the
is
an
operating
theatre
the
great
and
the
and
the
bedrooms
are
wards
the
army
of
waiters
and
valets
and
chambermaids
has
gone
and
everywhere
there
are
surgeons
ambulance
men
hospital
orderlies
and
the
belgian
nurses
with
their
white
overalls
and
red
crosses
and
in
every
corridor
and
on
every
staircase
and
in
every
room
there
is
a
mixed
odour
bitter
and
sweet
and
penetrating
of
antiseptics
and
of
ether
when
the
ambulance
cars
come
up
from
the
railway
stations
and
the
the
last
inappropriate
detail
the
mahogany
revolving
doors
will
disappear
so
that
the
wounded
may
be
carried
through
on
their
stretchers
i
confess
to
a
slight
persistent
fear
of
these
wounded
whom
i
can
not
help
it
is
not
very
active
it
has
left
off
visualizing
the
horror
of
bloody
bandages
and
mangled
bodies
but
it
there
it
waits
for
me
in
every
corridor
and
at
the
turn
of
every
stair
and
it
makes
me
loathe
myself
we
have
news
this
morning
of
a
battle
at
alost
a
town
about
fifteen
kilometres
of
ghent
the
belgians
are
moving
forty
thousand
men
from
antwerp
towards
ghent
and
heavy
fighting
is
expected
near
the
town
if
we
are
not
in
the
thick
of
it
we
are
on
the
edge
of
the
thick
they
have
just
told
us
an
awful
thing
two
wounded
men
were
left
lying
out
on
the
all
night
after
yesterday
fighting
the
military
ambulances
did
not
fetch
them
our
ambulance
was
not
sent
out
there
are
all
sorts
of
formalities
to
be
observed
before
it
can
go
we
have
got
our
military
passes
yet
and
our
english
red
cross
brassards
are
no
use
we
must
have
belgian
ones
stamped
with
the
government
stamp
and
these
things
take
time
meanwhile
we
who
have
still
the
appearance
of
a
disorganized
tourist
party
are
beginning
to
realize
each
other
the
first
step
to
realizing
ourselves
we
have
come
from
heaven
knows
where
to
live
together
here
heaven
knows
for
how
long
the
commandant
and
i
are
friends
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
are
friends
haynes
and
bird
are
evidently
friends
our
chauffeurs
bert
and
tom
are
bound
to
fraternize
professionally
we
and
they
are
all
right
but
these
pairs
were
only
known
to
each
other
a
week
or
two
ago
and
some
of
the
thirteen
never
met
at
all
till
yesterday
an
unknown
fourteenth
is
coming
we
are
five
women
and
nine
men
you
might
wonder
how
for
all
social
purposes
we
are
to
sort
ourselves
but
the
idea
sternly
emphasized
by
torrence
is
that
we
have
no
social
purposes
we
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
strictly
official
and
absolutely
impersonal
body
held
together
not
by
the
ordinary
affinities
of
men
and
women
but
by
a
common
devotion
and
a
common
aim
differences
if
any
should
exist
will
be
sunk
in
the
interest
of
the
community
probabilities
that
rule
all
human
intercourse
as
we
have
hitherto
known
it
will
be
temporarily
suspended
in
our
case
but
we
shall
gain
more
than
we
lose
insignificant
as
individuals
as
a
corps
we
share
the
honour
and
prestige
of
the
military
authority
under
which
we
work
we
have
visions
of
a
relentless
discipline
commanding
and
controlling
us
a
cold
glory
hovers
over
the
commandant
as
the
vehicle
of
this
transcendent
power
when
the
power
has
its
way
with
us
it
will
take
no
count
of
friendships
or
affinities
it
will
set
precedence
at
naught
it
will
say
to
itself
here
are
two
field
ambulance
cars
and
fourteen
people
five
out
of
these
fourteen
are
women
and
what
the
devil
are
they
doing
in
a
field
ambulance
and
it
will
appoint
two
surgeons
who
will
also
serve
as
to
each
car
it
will
set
our
trained
nurse
torrence
in
command
of
the
untrained
nurses
in
one
of
the
wards
of
the
military
hospital
no
ii
the
hospital
itself
will
find
suitable
feminine
tasks
for
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
while
janet
mcneil
and
the
secretary
will
be
told
off
to
work
among
the
refugees
and
until
more
are
wanted
the
rest
of
us
will
be
nowhere
if
nothing
can
be
found
for
our
women
in
the
hospital
they
will
be
sent
home
it
seems
inconceivable
that
the
power
if
it
is
anything
like
lord
kitchener
can
decide
otherwise
odd
how
the
war
changes
us
i
who
abhor
and
resist
authority
who
hardly
know
how
i
am
to
bring
myself
to
obey
my
friend
the
commandant
am
enamoured
of
this
power
and
utterly
submissive
i
realize
with
something
like
a
thrill
that
we
are
in
a
military
hospital
under
military
orders
and
that
my
irrelevant
former
self
with
all
that
it
has
desired
or
done
must
henceforth
cease
perhaps
irrevocably
to
exist
i
contemplate
its
extinction
with
equanimity
i
remember
that
one
of
my
brothers
was
a
captain
in
the
gunners
that
another
of
them
fought
as
a
volunteer
in
the
first
boer
war
that
my
uncle
captain
hind
of
the
bengal
fusiliers
fought
in
the
mutiny
and
in
the
crimean
war
and
his
son
at
chitral
and
that
i
have
one
nephew
in
kitchener
army
and
one
in
the
west
lancashire
hussars
and
that
three
generations
of
solid
and
can
not
separate
me
from
my
forefathers
who
seem
to
have
been
fighting
all
the
time
at
the
moment
i
have
forgotten
my
five
weeks
blue
funk
torrence
desire
for
discipline
is
not
more
sincere
than
mine
meanwhile
the
hand
that
is
to
lick
us
into
shape
hovers
over
us
and
does
not
fall
we
wait
expectantly
in
the
which
is
to
contain
us
it
was
once
the
of
a
fine
suite
a
diminutive
vestibule
divides
it
from
the
corridor
you
enter
through
double
doors
with
muffed
glass
panes
in
a
wooden
partition
opposite
the
wide
french
windows
opening
on
the
balcony
a
pale
blond
light
from
the
south
fills
the
room
its
walls
are
bare
except
for
a
map
of
belgium
faced
by
a
print
from
one
of
the
illustrated
papers
representing
the
king
and
queen
of
the
belgians
of
its
original
furnishings
only
a
few
cane
chairs
and
a
settee
remain
these
are
set
back
round
the
walls
and
in
the
window
long
tables
with
marble
tops
brought
up
from
what
was
once
the
hotel
restaurant
enclose
three
sides
of
a
hollow
square
like
this
round
these
we
group
ourselves
thus
the
commandant
in
the
middle
of
the
top
table
in
the
window
between
torrence
and
ursula
dearmer
haynes
and
bird
on
the
other
side
of
ursula
dearmer
the
chauffeurs
tom
and
bert
round
the
corner
at
the
side
table
i
am
round
the
other
corner
at
the
side
table
by
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
is
on
my
right
and
on
hers
are
lambert
and
foster
and
the
chaplain
riley
sits
alone
on
the
inside
opposite
torrence
this
rather
quiet
and
very
serious
person
interests
me
he
does
say
anything
and
you
wonder
what
sort
of
consciousness
goes
on
under
the
boyish
black
velvet
hair
nature
has
left
his
features
a
bit
unfinished
the
further
to
baffle
you
all
these
people
are
interesting
intensely
interesting
and
baffling
as
men
and
women
are
bound
to
be
who
have
come
from
heaven
knows
where
to
face
heaven
knows
what
most
of
them
are
quite
innocently
unaware
they
do
not
know
that
they
are
interesting
or
baffling
either
they
do
not
know
and
it
has
not
occurred
to
them
to
wonder
how
they
are
going
to
affect
each
other
or
how
they
are
going
to
behave
nobody
you
would
say
is
going
to
affect
the
commandant
when
he
is
not
dashing
up
and
down
driven
by
his
mysterious
energy
he
stands
apart
in
remote
and
dreamy
isolation
his
eyes
when
they
are
not
darting
brilliantly
in
pursuit
of
the
person
or
the
thing
he
needs
stand
apart
too
in
a
blank
blue
purity
undarkened
by
any
perception
of
the
details
that
may
accumulate
under
his
innocent
nose
he
has
called
this
corps
into
being
gathered
these
strange
men
and
women
up
with
a
sweep
of
his
wing
and
swept
them
almost
violently
together
he
does
know
how
any
of
us
are
going
to
behave
he
has
taken
for
granted
with
his
naïve
and
trust
in
the
beauty
of
human
nature
that
we
are
all
going
to
behave
beautifully
he
is
absorbed
in
his
scheme
each
one
of
us
fits
into
it
at
some
point
and
if
there
is
anything
in
us
left
over
it
is
not
at
the
moment
his
concern
yet
he
himself
has
margins
about
him
and
a
mysterious
hinterland
not
to
be
confined
or
accounted
for
by
any
scheme
he
alone
of
us
has
the
air
buoyant
restless
and
a
little
vague
of
being
in
for
some
tremendous
but
wholly
visionary
adventure
when
i
look
at
him
i
wonder
again
what
this
particular
adventure
is
going
to
do
to
him
and
whether
he
has
even
now
any
vivid
sense
of
the
things
that
are
about
to
happen
i
remember
that
evening
in
my
scullery
and
how
he
talked
about
the
german
as
if
they
were
details
in
some
unreal
scene
the
most
interesting
part
say
of
a
successful
cinematograph
show
but
they
are
really
bringing
up
those
from
namur
and
the
commandant
has
brought
four
women
with
him
besides
me
i
confess
i
was
appalled
when
i
first
knew
that
they
would
be
brought
torrence
perhaps
for
she
is
in
love
with
danger
and
she
is
of
the
kind
whom
no
power
military
or
otherwise
can
keep
back
from
their
desired
destiny
but
why
little
janet
mcneil
she
is
the
youngest
of
us
an
child
who
has
followed
torrence
and
will
follow
her
if
she
walks
straight
into
the
german
trenches
she
sits
beside
me
on
my
right
ready
for
anything
all
her
delicate
highland
beauty
bundled
up
in
the
kit
of
a
little
arctic
explorer
utterly
determined
utterly
impassive
her
small
face
under
the
woolly
cap
that
defies
the
north
pole
is
nearly
always
grave
but
it
has
a
sudden
smile
that
is
adorable
and
the
youngest
but
one
ursula
dearmer
who
ca
be
so
much
older
riley
gloom
and
the
commandant
hinterland
are
nothing
to
the
mystery
of
this
young
girl
she
looks
as
if
she
were
not
yet
perfectly
awake
as
if
it
would
take
considerably
more
than
the
of
namur
to
rouse
her
she
moves
about
slowly
as
if
she
were
in
no
sort
of
hurry
for
the
adventure
she
has
eyes
with
sleepy
drooping
eyelids
that
blink
at
you
she
has
a
rather
sleepy
rather
drooping
nose
her
shoulders
droop
her
small
head
droops
slightly
half
the
time
if
she
were
not
so
slender
she
would
be
rather
like
a
pretty
dormouse
from
its
torpor
you
insist
on
the
determination
of
her
little
underlip
only
to
be
contradicted
by
her
gentle
and
chin
in
our
among
a
band
of
turbulent
female
volunteers
all
clamouring
for
the
ursula
dearmer
dressed
very
simply
rather
like
a
senior
and
accompanied
by
her
mother
had
a
most
engaging
air
of
submission
and
docility
if
anybody
breaks
out
into
bravura
it
will
not
be
ursula
dearmer
this
thought
consoles
me
when
i
think
of
the
last
solemn
scenes
in
that
and
of
the
pledges
the
frightfully
sacred
pledges
i
gave
to
ursula
dearmer
mother
as
a
result
of
this
responsibility
i
see
myself
told
off
to
the
dreary
duty
of
conducting
ursula
dearmer
back
to
dover
at
the
moment
when
things
begin
to
be
really
thick
and
thrilling
and
i
deplore
the
commandant
indiscriminate
hospitality
to
volunteers
lambert
she
must
surely
be
the
next
youngest
you
can
think
of
with
less
agitation
in
spite
of
her
youth
her
charming
eyes
and
the
recklessly
extravagant
quantity
of
her
golden
hair
for
she
is
an
american
citizen
and
she
has
a
husband
also
an
american
citizen
in
ghent
and
her
husband
has
a
and
if
the
germans
should
ever
advance
upon
this
city
he
can
be
relied
upon
to
take
her
out
of
it
before
they
can
possibly
get
in
besides
even
in
the
german
lines
american
citizens
are
safe
we
are
all
suffering
a
slight
tension
the
men
who
can
see
no
reason
why
the
ambulance
should
not
have
been
sent
out
last
night
are
restless
and
abstracted
and
impatient
for
the
order
to
get
up
and
go
no
wonder
they
have
been
waiting
five
weeks
for
their
chance
there
is
haynes
whose
large
dark
head
and
heavy
shoulders
look
as
if
they
sustained
the
whole
weight
of
an
intolerable
world
his
features
designed
for
sensuous
composure
brood
in
a
sad
and
sulky
resignation
to
the
boredom
of
delay
his
friend
bird
the
young
man
with
the
head
of
an
enormous
cherub
and
the
hair
of
a
blond
baby
hair
that
fall
in
a
shining
lock
on
his
pink
forehead
bird
has
an
air
of
boisterous
preparation
as
if
the
ambulance
were
a
picnic
party
and
he
was
responsible
for
the
champagne
foster
the
inquiring
tourist
looks
a
little
anxious
as
if
he
were
preoccupied
with
the
train
he
got
to
catch
bert
the
chauffeur
sits
tight
with
the
grim
assurance
of
a
man
who
knows
that
the
expedition
can
not
start
without
him
the
chauffeur
tom
has
an
expressive
face
every
minute
it
becomes
more
vivid
with
humorous
contemptuous
indignant
protest
it
says
plainly
well
this
is
about
the
rottenest
show
i
ever
was
let
in
for
bar
none
call
yourself
a
field
ambulance
garn
and
if
you
a
field
ambulance
who
but
a
blanky
fool
would
have
hit
upon
this
old
blankety
haunt
of
peace
it
be
the
conference
next
but
it
is
on
the
chaplain
grierson
that
the
strain
is
telling
most
it
shows
in
his
pale
and
prominent
blue
eyes
and
in
a
slight
whiteness
about
his
high
in
his
valiant
khaki
he
has
more
than
any
of
us
the
air
of
being
on
the
eve
he
is
visibly
bracing
himself
to
a
stupendous
effort
he
smokes
a
cigarette
with
ostentatious
nonchalance
we
all
think
we
know
these
symptoms
we
turn
our
eyes
away
considerately
from
grierson
which
of
us
can
say
that
when
our
turn
comes
the
thought
of
danger
will
not
spoil
our
breakfast
the
poor
boy
squares
his
shoulders
he
is
white
now
round
the
edges
of
his
lips
but
he
is
going
through
with
it
suddenly
he
speaks
i
shall
hold
matins
in
this
room
at
ten
every
sunday
morning
if
any
of
you
like
to
attend
you
may
there
is
a
terrible
silence
none
of
us
look
at
each
other
none
of
us
look
at
grierson
presently
torrence
is
heard
protesting
that
we
have
come
here
for
matins
that
this
is
a
and
not
a
private
chapel
and
that
matins
are
against
all
military
discipline
i
shall
hold
matins
all
the
same
says
grierson
his
voice
is
thick
and
jerky
and
if
anybody
likes
to
attend
they
can
that
all
i
got
to
say
he
gets
up
he
faces
the
batteries
of
unholy
and
unsympathetic
eyes
he
throws
away
the
end
of
his
cigarette
with
a
gesture
of
superb
defiance
he
has
gone
through
with
it
he
has
faced
the
fire
he
has
come
out
not
quite
victorious
but
with
his
hero
honour
unstained
it
seemed
to
me
awful
that
none
of
us
should
want
his
matins
i
should
like
personally
to
see
him
through
with
them
i
could
face
the
hostile
eyes
but
what
i
can
not
face
is
the
ceremony
itself
my
was
spoiled
with
too
many
ceremonies
in
my
youth
ceremonies
that
lacked
all
beauty
and
sincerity
and
dignity
and
though
i
am
convinced
of
the
beauty
and
sincerity
and
dignity
of
grierson
soul
i
can
not
kneel
down
with
him
and
take
part
in
the
performance
of
his
prayer
prayer
is
either
the
supreme
illusion
or
the
supreme
act
the
pure
and
naked
surrender
to
reality
and
attended
by
such
sacredness
and
shyness
that
you
can
accomplish
it
only
when
alone
or
lost
in
a
multitude
that
prays
but
why
is
there
no
victoria
cross
for
moral
courage
wilson
has
come
he
looks
clever
and
nice
our
restlessness
increases
i
have
seen
one
of
them
as
i
went
downstairs
this
morning
two
men
carrying
a
stretcher
crossed
the
landing
below
i
saw
the
outline
of
the
wounded
body
under
the
blanket
and
the
head
laid
back
on
the
pillow
it
is
impossible
it
is
inconceivable
that
i
should
have
been
afraid
of
seeing
this
it
is
as
if
the
wounded
man
himself
absolved
me
from
the
memory
and
the
reproach
of
fear
i
stood
by
the
to
let
them
pass
there
was
some
difficulty
about
turning
at
the
riley
was
there
he
came
forward
and
took
one
end
of
the
stretcher
and
turned
it
he
was
very
quiet
and
very
gentle
you
could
see
that
he
did
the
right
thing
by
instinct
and
i
saw
his
face
and
knew
what
had
brought
him
here
and
here
on
the
first
landing
is
another
wounded
his
face
is
deformed
by
an
abscess
from
a
bullet
in
his
mouth
it
gives
him
a
terrible
look
half
savage
wholly
suffering
he
sits
there
and
can
not
speak
riley
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
found
anything
to
do
so
presently
we
go
out
to
get
our
military
passes
we
stroll
miserably
about
the
town
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
our
futility
we
buy
cigarettes
for
the
convalescents
and
at
noon
no
orders
have
come
for
us
they
come
just
as
we
are
sitting
down
to
lunch
our
ambulance
car
is
to
go
to
alost
at
once
the
commandant
is
arrested
in
the
act
of
cutting
bread
bird
is
arrested
in
the
act
of
eating
it
we
are
all
arrested
in
our
several
acts
as
if
they
had
been
criminal
acts
we
desist
suddenly
the
men
get
up
and
look
at
each
other
it
is
clear
that
they
can
not
all
go
grierson
looks
at
the
commandant
his
face
is
a
little
white
and
strained
as
it
was
this
morning
when
he
announced
matins
for
ten
the
commandant
looks
at
bird
and
tells
him
that
he
may
go
if
he
likes
his
tone
is
admirably
casual
it
conveys
no
sense
of
the
magnificence
of
his
renunciation
he
looks
also
at
grierson
and
foster
the
lot
of
honour
falls
upon
these
three
they
set
out
still
with
their
air
of
a
youthful
picnic
party
bird
is
more
than
ever
the
boisterous
young
man
in
charge
of
the
champagne
i
am
contented
so
long
as
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
and
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
and
the
commandant
do
not
go
yet
to
anybody
who
knows
the
commandant
he
is
bound
to
be
a
prominent
figure
in
the
terrible
moving
pictures
made
by
fear
smitten
by
some
great
idea
he
dashes
out
of
cover
as
the
shrapnel
is
falling
he
wanders
wrapped
in
a
happy
dream
into
the
enemies
trenches
he
mingles
with
their
lines
of
communication
as
i
have
seen
him
mingle
with
the
traffic
at
the
junction
of
chandos
street
and
the
strand
if
you
were
to
inform
him
of
a
patrol
of
uhlans
coming
down
the
road
he
would
only
say
i
see
no
uhlans
and
continue
in
their
direction
it
is
inconceivable
to
his
optimism
that
he
should
encounter
uhlans
in
a
world
so
obviously
made
for
peace
and
righteousness
so
that
it
is
a
relief
to
see
somebody
else
whom
i
do
not
know
quite
so
well
going
first
time
enough
to
be
jumpy
when
the
commandant
and
the
women
go
forth
on
the
perilous
adventure
that
is
all
very
well
but
i
am
jumpy
all
the
same
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
going
out
first
grierson
and
foster
have
suddenly
become
dear
and
sacred
their
lives
their
persons
their
very
clothes
bird
cheerful
face
which
is
so
like
an
overgrown
cherub
his
blond
gold
lock
of
infantile
hair
grierson
pale
eyes
that
foresee
danger
his
not
too
well
fitting
khaki
coat
have
acquired
suddenly
a
priceless
value
the
value
of
things
long
seen
and
long
admired
it
is
as
if
i
had
known
them
all
my
life
as
if
life
will
be
unendurable
if
they
do
not
come
back
safe
it
is
not
very
endurable
now
of
all
the
things
that
can
happen
to
a
woman
on
a
field
ambulance
the
worst
is
to
stay
behind
to
stay
behind
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
to
devise
a
variety
of
dreadful
deaths
for
tom
the
chauffeur
and
bird
and
grierson
and
foster
to
know
nothing
except
that
alost
is
being
bombarded
and
that
it
is
to
alost
that
they
are
going
and
the
others
who
have
been
left
behind
are
hanging
about
in
gloom
disgusted
with
their
fate
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
are
beginning
to
ask
themselves
what
they
are
here
for
to
go
through
the
wards
is
only
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
angelic
beings
with
red
crosses
on
their
breasts
and
foreheads
who
are
already
somewhat
in
each
other
way
torrence
and
the
others
do
however
go
into
the
wards
and
talk
to
the
wounded
and
cheer
them
up
i
sit
in
the
deserted
and
look
at
the
lunch
that
tom
and
bird
and
grierson
should
have
eaten
and
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
go
round
the
wards
and
cheer
the
wounded
up
i
wonder
whether
there
is
anything
i
could
conceivably
do
for
the
wounded
that
would
not
bore
them
inexpressibly
if
i
were
to
do
it
i
frame
sentence
after
sentence
in
strange
and
abominable
french
and
each
apart
from
its
own
inherent
absurdity
seems
a
mockery
of
the
wounded
you
can
not
go
to
an
immortal
hero
and
grin
at
him
and
say
and
expect
him
to
be
cheered
up
especially
when
you
know
yourself
to
be
one
of
a
long
procession
of
women
who
have
done
the
same
i
abandon
myself
to
my
malady
of
it
is
at
its
worst
when
jean
and
max
the
convalescent
orderlies
come
in
to
remove
the
ruins
of
our
mess
they
are
pathetic
and
adorable
with
their
heads
in
the
pallor
of
their
convalescence
jean
is
attired
in
a
suit
of
yellowish
linen
and
max
in
striped
flannels
jean
pallor
is
decorated
there
is
no
other
word
for
it
with
eyes
black
eyebrows
black
eyelashes
and
a
little
black
moustache
he
is
martial
and
ardent
and
alert
but
the
pallor
of
max
is
unredeemed
it
is
morbid
and
profound
it
has
invaded
his
whole
being
his
eyelids
and
his
small
sensitive
mouth
are
involved
and
his
round
dark
eyes
have
the
queer
grey
look
of
some
lamentable
wonder
and
amazement
but
neither
horror
nor
discipline
have
spoiled
his
engaging
air
the
air
of
a
very
young
who
has
broken
loose
and
got
into
this
military
hospital
by
mistake
i
do
not
know
whether
intuition
is
a
french
or
belgian
gift
jean
and
max
are
not
belgian
but
french
and
they
have
it
to
a
marvellous
degree
they
seemed
to
know
in
an
instant
what
was
the
matter
with
the
english
lady
and
they
set
about
curing
the
malady
i
have
seldom
seen
such
perfect
tact
and
gentleness
as
was
then
displayed
by
those
two
hospital
orderlies
max
and
jean
they
had
been
wounded
not
so
very
long
ago
but
they
think
nothing
of
that
they
intimate
that
if
i
insist
on
helping
them
with
their
plates
and
dishes
they
will
be
wounded
and
more
severely
in
their
honour
we
converse
it
is
in
conversation
that
they
are
most
adorable
they
gaze
at
you
with
candid
innocent
eyes
not
a
quiver
of
a
lip
or
an
eyelash
betrays
to
you
the
outrageous
quality
of
your
french
the
behaviour
of
your
sentences
would
cause
a
scandal
in
a
private
boarding
school
for
young
ladies
it
is
so
fantastically
incorrect
but
max
and
jean
receive
each
phrase
with
an
imperturbable
and
charming
gravity
by
the
subtlest
suggestion
of
manner
they
assure
you
that
you
speak
with
fluency
and
distinction
that
yours
is
a
very
perfect
french
only
their
severe
attentiveness
warns
you
of
the
strain
you
are
putting
on
them
max
lingered
long
after
jean
had
departed
to
his
kitchen
and
presently
he
gave
up
his
secret
he
is
a
student
and
they
took
him
from
his
college
his
course
unfinished
to
fight
for
his
country
when
the
war
broke
out
his
mother
went
mad
with
the
horror
of
it
he
told
me
this
quite
simply
as
if
he
were
relating
a
common
incident
of
then
with
a
little
air
of
mystery
he
signed
to
me
to
follow
him
along
the
corridor
he
stopped
at
a
closed
door
and
showed
me
a
name
inscribed
in
thick
ornamental
gothic
characters
on
a
card
tacked
to
the
panel
prosper
panne
max
is
not
his
real
name
it
is
the
name
that
prosper
panne
has
taken
to
disguise
himself
while
he
is
a
servant
prosper
panne
est
écrivain
he
writes
for
the
paris
papers
he
looked
at
me
with
his
amazed
pathetic
eyes
and
pointed
with
a
finger
to
his
breast
to
assure
me
that
he
is
he
prosper
panne
and
in
the
end
i
asked
him
whether
it
would
bore
the
wounded
frightfully
if
i
took
them
some
cigarettes
i
laid
in
cigarettes
this
morning
as
a
provision
for
this
desolate
afternoon
and
dear
prosper
panne
so
thoroughly
did
he
understand
my
malady
that
he
himself
escorted
me
it
is
as
if
he
knew
the
that
restrains
me
from
flinging
myself
into
the
presence
of
the
wounded
and
graceful
turning
now
and
then
with
his
instinct
of
protection
the
orderly
glides
before
me
smoothing
the
way
between
my
shyness
and
this
dreaded
majesty
of
suffering
i
followed
him
with
my
cigarettes
in
my
hand
and
my
heart
in
my
mouth
into
the
big
ward
on
the
ground
floor
i
do
want
to
describe
that
ward
or
the
effect
of
those
rows
upon
rows
of
beds
those
rows
upon
rows
of
bound
and
bandaged
bodies
the
intensity
of
physical
anguish
suggested
by
sheer
force
of
multiplication
by
the
diminishing
perspective
of
the
beds
by
the
clear
light
and
nakedness
of
the
great
hall
that
sets
these
repeated
units
of
torture
in
a
world
apart
a
world
of
insufferable
space
and
agonizing
time
ruled
by
some
inhuman
mathematics
and
given
over
to
pure
transcendent
pain
a
sufficiently
large
ward
full
of
wounded
really
does
leave
an
impression
very
like
that
but
the
one
true
thing
about
this
impression
is
its
transcendence
it
is
utterly
removed
from
and
unlike
anything
that
you
have
experienced
before
from
the
moment
that
the
doors
have
closed
behind
you
you
are
in
another
world
and
under
its
strange
impact
you
are
given
new
senses
and
a
new
soul
if
there
is
horror
here
you
are
not
aware
of
it
as
horror
before
these
multiplied
forms
of
anguish
what
you
feel
if
there
be
anything
of
left
to
feel
is
not
pity
because
it
is
so
near
to
adoration
if
you
are
tired
of
the
burden
and
malady
of
self
go
into
one
of
these
great
wards
and
you
will
find
instant
release
you
and
the
sum
of
your
little
consciousness
are
not
things
that
matter
any
more
the
lowest
and
the
least
of
these
wounded
belgians
is
of
supreme
importance
and
infinite
significance
you
who
were
once
afraid
of
them
and
of
their
wounds
may
think
that
you
would
suffer
for
them
now
gladly
but
you
are
not
allowed
to
suffer
you
are
marvellously
and
mercilessly
let
off
in
this
sudden
deliverance
from
yourself
you
have
received
the
ultimate
absolution
and
their
torment
is
your
peace
in
the
big
ward
very
few
of
the
men
were
well
enough
to
smoke
so
we
went
to
the
little
wards
where
the
convalescents
are
max
leading
i
do
not
think
that
max
has
received
absolution
yet
it
is
quite
evident
that
he
is
proud
of
his
into
this
place
and
of
his
intimacy
with
the
wounded
of
his
rôle
of
interpreter
but
how
perfectly
he
does
it
he
has
no
flemish
but
through
his
subtle
gestures
even
the
poor
flamand
who
has
no
french
understands
what
i
want
to
say
to
him
and
ca
he
turns
this
modest
presentation
of
cigarettes
into
a
high
social
function
a
trifle
ambitious
perhaps
but
triumphantly
achieved
all
that
was
over
by
about
three
when
the
sanctuary
cast
us
out
and
max
went
back
to
his
empty
kitchen
and
became
prosper
panne
again
and
remembered
that
his
mother
was
mad
and
i
went
to
the
empty
and
became
my
miserable
self
and
remembered
that
the
field
ambulance
was
still
out
god
knows
where
the
windows
look
south
over
the
railway
lines
towards
the
country
where
the
fighting
is
from
the
balcony
you
can
see
the
lines
where
the
troop
trains
run
going
and
the
station
the
post
office
the
telegraph
and
telephone
offices
are
here
all
in
one
long
building
that
bounds
one
side
of
the
it
stands
at
right
angles
to
the
flandria
and
stretches
along
opposite
its
flank
it
has
a
flat
roof
with
a
crenelated
parapet
grass
grows
on
the
roof
no
guns
are
mounted
there
for
ghent
is
an
open
city
but
in
german
tactics
bombardment
by
aeroplane
does
seem
to
count
and
our
situation
is
more
provocative
now
than
the
terminus
hotel
at
ostend
beyond
the
straight
black
railway
lines
are
miles
upon
miles
of
flat
open
country
green
fields
and
rows
of
poplars
and
little
woods
and
here
and
there
a
low
rise
dark
with
trees
under
our
windows
the
white
street
runs
and
along
it
scouting
cars
and
cycling
corps
rush
to
the
fighting
lines
and
military
hurry
impatiently
carrying
belgian
staff
officers
the
ammunition
wagons
lumber
along
and
the
troops
march
in
a
long
file
to
disappear
round
the
turn
of
the
road
that
is
where
the
others
have
gone
and
i
give
everything
i
possess
to
go
with
them
they
have
come
back
incredibly
safe
and
have
brought
in
four
wounded
there
was
a
large
crowd
gathered
in
the
to
see
them
come
a
crowd
that
has
nothing
to
do
and
that
lives
from
hour
to
hour
on
this
spectacle
of
the
wounded
intense
excitement
this
time
for
one
of
the
four
wounded
is
a
german
he
was
lying
on
a
stretcher
no
sooner
had
they
drawn
him
out
of
the
ambulance
than
they
put
him
back
again
no
germans
are
taken
in
at
our
hospital
they
are
all
sent
to
the
old
no
i
he
thrust
up
his
poor
hand
and
grabbed
the
hanging
strap
to
raise
himself
a
little
in
his
stretcher
and
i
saw
him
he
was
ruddy
and
handsome
his
thick
blond
hair
stood
up
stiff
from
his
forehead
his
little
blond
moustache
was
turned
up
and
twisted
fiercely
like
the
kaiser
the
crowd
booed
at
him
as
he
lay
there
his
was
a
terrible
pathos
unlike
any
other
he
was
so
defiant
and
so
helpless
and
there
another
emotion
gone
by
the
board
you
simply
could
not
hate
him
later
in
the
evening
both
cars
were
sent
out
car
no
with
the
commandant
and
if
you
will
believe
it
ursula
dearmer
heavens
what
can
the
military
power
be
thinking
of
car
no
took
wilson
and
torrence
the
military
power
i
suppose
has
ordained
this
too
and
when
i
think
of
torrence
dream
of
getting
into
the
greatest
possible
danger
i
am
glad
that
the
commandant
is
with
ursula
dearmer
we
pledged
our
words
he
and
i
that
danger
and
ursula
dearmer
should
never
meet
they
all
come
back
impossibly
safe
they
are
rather
like
children
after
the
party
too
excited
to
give
a
lucid
and
coherent
tale
of
what
done
my
ambulance
stores
the
stuff
from
which
reports
and
newspaper
articles
are
to
be
made
i
note
that
car
no
has
brought
three
wounded
to
hospital
and
that
car
no
has
brought
four
wounded
to
hospital
also
that
a
bullet
has
been
found
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
three
there
is
a
considerable
stir
among
the
surgeons
over
this
bullet
they
are
vaguely
gratified
at
its
being
found
in
our
hospital
and
not
the
other
little
janet
mcneil
and
riley
and
all
the
others
who
were
left
behind
have
gone
to
bed
in
hopeless
gloom
even
the
bullet
has
roused
them
beyond
the
first
tense
moment
i
ask
for
ink
and
dear
max
has
given
me
all
his
in
his
own
we
have
been
here
a
hundred
years
car
no
went
out
at
this
morning
with
the
commandant
and
bird
and
ursula
dearmer
and
grierson
and
a
belgian
red
cross
guide
with
tom
the
chauffeur
that
makes
six
tom
face
as
he
sees
this
party
swarming
on
his
car
is
expressive
of
tumultuous
passions
disgust
predominates
their
clothes
seem
stranger
than
ever
by
contrast
with
the
severe
military
khaki
of
the
car
bird
has
added
to
his
civilian
costume
a
belgian
forage
cap
with
a
red
tassel
that
hangs
over
his
forehead
it
was
given
to
him
yesterday
by
way
of
homage
to
his
courage
and
his
personal
charm
but
it
makes
him
horribly
vulnerable
the
chaplain
standing
out
from
the
rest
of
the
corps
in
complete
khaki
is
an
even
more
inevitable
mark
for
bullets
tom
stares
at
everybody
with
eyes
of
violent
inquiry
he
still
evidently
wants
to
know
whether
we
call
ourselves
a
field
ambulance
he
starts
his
car
with
movements
of
exasperation
and
despair
we
are
to
judge
what
his
sense
of
discipline
must
be
since
he
consents
to
drive
the
thing
at
all
the
commandant
affects
not
to
see
tom
perhaps
he
really
does
see
him
it
is
just
as
well
that
he
ca
see
torrence
or
janet
mcneil
or
riley
or
haynes
they
are
overpowered
by
this
tragedy
of
being
left
behind
under
it
the
discipline
of
the
hospital
breaks
down
the
child
is
threatening
to
commit
suicide
or
else
go
home
she
regards
the
two
acts
as
equivalent
riley
gloom
is
now
so
awful
that
he
will
not
speak
when
he
is
spoken
to
he
looks
at
me
with
dumb
hostility
as
if
he
thought
that
i
had
something
to
do
with
it
haynes
melancholy
is
even
more
because
it
is
gentle
and
unexpressed
i
try
to
console
them
i
point
out
that
it
is
a
question
of
arithmetic
there
are
only
two
cars
and
there
are
fourteen
of
us
fourteen
into
two
wo
go
even
if
you
do
count
the
wounded
and
after
all
we
have
been
here
two
days
but
it
is
no
good
we
have
been
here
a
hundred
years
and
we
have
done
nothing
there
is
anything
to
do
there
are
not
enough
wounded
to
go
round
we
turn
our
eyes
with
longing
towards
antwerp
so
soon
to
be
battered
by
the
from
namur
and
bert
poor
bert
he
has
crawled
into
ambulance
car
no
where
it
stands
outside
in
the
hospital
yard
and
he
has
hidden
himself
under
the
hood
lambert
is
a
little
sad
too
but
we
are
none
of
us
very
sorry
for
lambert
we
have
gathered
that
her
husband
is
a
journalist
and
that
he
is
special
correspondent
at
the
front
for
some
american
paper
he
has
a
which
we
assume
rashly
to
be
the
property
of
his
paper
he
is
always
dashing
off
to
the
in
it
and
lambert
is
always
at
liberty
to
go
with
him
she
is
mistaken
if
she
thinks
that
her
sorrow
is
in
any
way
comparable
with
ours
but
if
there
are
not
enough
wounded
to
go
round
in
ghent
there
are
more
refugees
than
ghent
can
deal
with
they
are
pouring
in
by
all
the
roads
from
alost
and
termonde
every
train
disgorges
multitudes
of
them
into
the
this
morning
i
went
to
the
matron
madame
and
told
her
i
was
much
good
but
i
be
glad
if
she
could
give
me
some
work
i
said
i
supposed
there
was
some
to
be
done
among
the
refugees
work
among
the
refugees
they
could
employ
whole
armies
of
us
there
are
thousands
of
refugees
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
i
had
better
go
there
and
see
what
is
being
done
madame
will
give
me
an
introduction
to
her
madame
the
présidente
of
the
comité
des
dames
and
to
her
niece
mademoiselle
who
will
take
me
to
the
palais
and
madame
adds
that
there
will
soon
be
work
for
all
of
us
in
the
hospital
yes
even
for
the
untrained
life
is
once
more
bearable
but
the
others
wo
believe
it
they
say
there
are
three
hundred
nurses
in
the
hospital
and
the
fact
remains
that
we
have
two
young
surgeons
cooling
their
heels
in
the
corridors
and
a
nurse
tearing
her
hair
out
while
the
young
girl
ursula
dearmer
takes
the
field
and
i
think
of
the
poor
little
dreamy
guileless
commandant
in
his
conspicuous
car
and
i
smile
at
her
in
secret
thanking
heaven
that
ursula
dearmer
and
not
torrence
who
is
at
his
side
the
ambulance
has
come
back
from
alost
with
two
or
three
wounded
and
some
refugees
the
commandant
is
visibly
elated
elated
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
work
actually
done
ursula
dearmer
is
not
elated
in
the
very
least
but
she
is
her
docility
has
vanished
with
her
torpor
she
and
the
commandant
both
look
as
if
something
extremely
agreeable
had
happened
to
them
at
alost
but
they
are
reticent
we
gather
that
ursula
dearmer
has
been
working
with
the
nuns
in
the
convent
at
alost
where
the
wounded
were
taken
before
the
ambulance
cars
removed
them
to
ghent
it
sounded
very
safe
but
the
commandant
dashed
into
my
room
after
luncheon
his
face
was
radiant
almost
ecstatic
he
was
like
a
child
who
has
rushed
in
to
tell
you
how
ripping
the
pantomime
was
we
been
but
i
was
very
angry
coldly
and
quietly
angry
i
felt
like
that
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
piloting
my
mother
through
the
thick
of
the
traffic
between
guildhall
and
the
bank
and
she
broke
from
me
and
was
all
but
run
over
i
do
quite
know
what
i
said
to
him
but
i
think
i
said
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
it
seems
that
ursula
dearmer
was
with
him
i
remembered
how
ursula
dearmer
mother
had
come
to
me
in
the
and
asked
me
how
near
we
proposed
to
go
to
the
and
whether
her
daughter
would
be
in
any
danger
and
how
i
said
first
of
all
that
there
was
any
use
pretending
that
there
would
be
danger
and
that
the
chances
were
and
how
the
commandant
had
intervened
at
that
moment
to
assure
her
that
danger
there
would
be
none
with
a
finger
on
the
map
of
france
and
belgium
he
traced
the
probable
the
inevitable
course
of
the
campaign
and
in
light
casual
tones
which
allayed
all
anxiety
he
explained
how
as
the
germans
advanced
upon
any
point
we
should
retire
upon
our
base
as
for
the
actual
with
one
gesture
he
swept
the
whole
into
the
distance
and
you
saw
it
as
an
infinitely
receding
tide
that
left
its
wrack
strewn
on
a
place
of
peace
where
the
ambulance
wandered
at
its
will
secure
from
danger
the
whole
thing
was
done
with
such
compelling
and
convincing
enthusiasm
that
ursula
dearmer
mother
adopted
more
and
more
the
humble
attitude
of
a
mere
woman
who
has
failed
to
grasp
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
ursula
dearmer
herself
looked
more
docile
than
ever
though
a
little
bored
and
very
sleepy
and
i
remembered
how
when
it
was
all
over
ursula
dearmer
mother
implored
me
if
there
any
danger
to
see
that
ursula
dearmer
was
sent
home
and
how
i
promised
that
whatever
happened
ursula
dearmer
would
be
safe
clinching
it
with
a
frightfully
sacred
inner
vow
and
saying
to
myself
at
the
same
time
what
a
terrible
nuisance
this
young
girl
is
going
to
be
i
saw
myself
at
the
moment
of
parting
standing
on
the
hearthrug
stiff
as
a
poker
with
resolution
and
saying
solemnly
i
keep
my
word
and
here
was
the
commandant
informing
me
with
glee
that
a
shell
had
fallen
and
burst
at
ursula
dearmer
feet
he
was
so
pleased
and
with
such
innocent
and
childlike
pleasure
that
i
had
the
heart
to
tell
him
that
there
was
much
resemblance
between
those
spaces
of
naked
peace
behind
the
receding
and
the
narrow
streets
of
a
bombarded
village
i
only
said
that
i
should
write
to
ursula
dearmer
mother
and
ask
her
to
release
me
from
my
promise
he
said
i
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
said
i
would
and
i
did
and
the
poor
commandant
left
me
somewhat
dashed
and
not
at
all
pleased
with
me
it
seems
that
the
shell
burst
not
exactly
at
ursula
dearmer
feet
but
ten
yards
away
from
her
it
came
romping
down
the
street
with
immense
impetus
and
determination
and
it
is
not
said
of
ursula
dearmer
that
she
was
much
less
coy
in
the
encounter
she
took
to
like
a
duck
to
water
bird
told
us
this
ursula
dearmer
herself
was
modest
and
claimed
no
sort
of
intimacy
with
the
shell
that
waked
her
up
she
was
as
nice
as
possible
about
it
but
all
the
same
into
the
whole
corps
that
part
of
it
that
had
been
left
behind
there
has
crept
a
sneaking
envy
of
her
luck
i
feel
it
myself
and
if
feel
it
what
must
torrence
and
janet
feel
lambert
anyhow
has
had
nothing
to
complain
of
so
far
her
husband
took
her
to
alost
in
his
i
mean
the
which
is
the
property
of
his
paper
in
the
afternoon
mademoiselle
called
to
take
me
to
the
palais
des
fêtes
we
stopped
at
a
shop
on
the
way
to
buy
the
belgian
red
cross
uniform
the
white
linen
overall
and
veil
which
you
must
wear
if
you
work
among
the
refugees
there
madame
is
very
kind
and
very
tired
she
has
been
working
here
since
early
morning
for
weeks
on
end
they
are
short
of
volunteers
for
the
service
of
the
evening
meals
and
i
am
to
work
at
the
tables
for
three
hours
from
six
to
nine
this
is
settled
and
a
young
red
cross
volunteer
takes
me
over
the
palais
it
is
an
immense
building
rather
like
olympia
it
stands
away
from
the
town
in
open
grounds
like
the
botanical
gardens
regent
park
it
is
where
the
great
annual
shows
were
held
and
the
vast
civic
entertainments
given
miles
of
country
round
ghent
are
given
up
to
there
are
whole
fields
of
begonias
out
here
brilliant
and
vivid
in
the
sun
they
will
never
be
sold
never
gathered
never
shown
in
the
palais
des
fêtes
it
is
the
peasants
the
men
and
women
who
tilled
these
fields
and
their
children
that
are
being
shown
here
in
the
splendid
and
wonderful
place
where
they
never
set
foot
before
there
are
four
thousand
of
them
lying
on
straw
in
the
outer
hall
in
a
space
larger
than
olympia
they
are
laid
out
in
rows
all
round
the
four
walls
and
on
every
foot
of
ground
between
men
women
and
children
together
packed
so
tight
that
there
is
barely
between
any
two
of
them
here
and
there
a
family
huddles
up
close
trying
to
put
a
few
inches
between
it
and
the
rest
some
have
hollowed
out
a
place
in
the
straw
or
piled
a
barrier
of
straw
between
themselves
and
their
neighbours
in
a
piteous
attempt
at
privacy
some
have
dragged
their
own
bedding
with
them
and
are
lodged
in
comparative
comfort
but
these
are
the
very
few
the
most
part
are
utterly
destitute
and
utterly
abandoned
to
their
destitution
they
are
broken
with
fatigue
they
have
stumbled
and
dropped
no
matter
where
no
matter
beside
whom
none
turns
from
his
neighbour
none
scorns
or
hates
or
loathes
his
fellow
the
rigidly
righteous
lies
in
the
straw
breast
to
breast
with
the
harlot
of
the
village
slum
and
her
innocent
daughter
back
to
back
with
the
parish
drunkard
nothing
matters
nothing
will
ever
matter
any
more
they
tell
you
that
when
darkness
comes
down
on
all
this
there
is
hell
but
you
do
not
believe
it
you
can
see
nothing
sordid
and
nothing
ugly
here
the
scale
is
too
vast
your
mind
refuses
this
coupling
of
infamy
with
transcendent
sorrow
it
rejects
all
images
but
the
one
image
of
desolation
which
is
final
and
supreme
it
is
as
if
these
forms
had
no
stability
and
no
significance
of
their
own
as
if
they
were
locked
together
in
one
immense
body
and
stirred
or
slept
as
one
two
or
three
figures
mount
guard
over
this
litter
of
prostrate
forms
they
are
old
men
and
old
women
seated
on
chairs
they
sit
upright
and
immobile
with
their
hands
folded
on
their
knees
some
of
them
have
fallen
asleep
where
they
sit
they
are
all
rigid
in
an
attitude
of
resignation
they
have
the
dignity
of
figures
that
will
endure
like
that
for
ever
they
are
flamands
this
place
is
terribly
still
there
is
hardly
any
rustling
of
the
straw
only
here
and
there
the
cry
of
a
child
fretting
for
sleep
or
for
its
mother
breast
these
people
do
not
speak
to
each
other
half
of
them
are
sound
asleep
fixed
in
the
posture
they
took
when
they
dropped
into
the
straw
the
others
are
drowsed
with
weariness
stupefied
with
sorrow
on
all
these
thousands
of
faces
there
is
a
mortal
apathy
their
ruin
is
complete
they
have
been
stripped
bare
of
the
means
of
life
and
of
all
likeness
to
living
things
they
do
not
speak
they
do
not
think
they
do
not
for
the
moment
feel
in
all
the
four
thousand
except
for
the
child
crying
yonder
there
is
not
one
tear
and
you
who
look
at
them
can
not
speak
or
think
or
feel
either
and
you
have
not
one
tear
a
path
has
been
cleared
through
the
straw
from
door
to
door
down
the
middle
of
the
immense
hall
a
narrower
track
goes
all
round
it
in
front
of
the
litters
that
are
ranged
under
the
walls
and
you
are
taken
through
and
round
the
show
you
are
to
see
it
all
the
dear
little
belgian
lady
your
guide
will
not
let
you
miss
anything
mademoiselle
ces
deux
petites
filles
sont
jolies
les
pauvres
deux
jeunes
mariés
qui
dorment
regardez
il
tient
encore
la
main
de
sa
you
look
yes
they
are
asleep
he
is
really
holding
her
hand
ces
quatre
petits
enfants
qui
ont
perdu
leur
père
et
leur
mère
triste
pas
mademoiselle
and
you
say
mademoiselle
bien
but
you
do
mean
it
you
do
feel
it
you
do
know
whether
it
is
or
not
you
are
not
sure
that
is
the
word
for
it
there
are
no
words
for
it
because
there
are
no
ideas
for
it
it
is
a
sorrow
that
transcends
all
sorrow
that
you
have
ever
known
you
have
a
sort
of
idea
that
perhaps
if
you
can
ever
feel
again
this
sight
will
be
worse
to
remember
than
it
is
to
see
you
ca
believe
what
you
see
you
are
stunned
stupefied
as
if
you
yourself
had
been
crushed
and
numbed
in
the
same
catastrophe
only
now
and
then
a
face
upturned
a
face
that
your
guide
has
pointed
out
to
you
surging
out
of
this
incredible
welter
of
faces
and
forms
smites
you
with
pity
and
you
feel
as
if
you
had
received
a
lacerating
wound
in
sleep
little
things
strike
you
though
already
you
are
forgetting
the
faces
of
the
two
little
girls
and
of
the
young
husband
and
wife
holding
each
other
hands
and
of
the
four
little
children
who
have
lost
their
father
and
mother
but
you
notice
the
little
dog
the
mongrel
terrier
that
absurd
little
dog
which
belongs
to
all
nations
and
all
countries
he
has
obtained
possession
of
the
warm
centre
of
a
pile
of
straw
and
is
curled
up
on
it
fast
asleep
and
the
flemish
family
who
brought
him
who
carried
him
in
turn
for
miles
rather
than
leave
him
to
the
germans
they
can
not
stretch
themselves
on
the
straw
because
of
him
they
have
propped
themselves
up
as
best
they
may
all
round
him
and
they
can
not
sleep
they
are
too
uncomfortable
more
thousands
than
there
is
room
for
in
the
straw
are
fed
three
times
a
day
in
the
inner
hall
leading
out
of
this
dreadful
dormitory
all
round
the
inner
hall
and
on
the
upper
story
off
the
gallery
are
rooms
for
washing
and
dressing
the
children
and
for
bandaging
sore
feet
and
attending
to
the
wounded
for
there
are
many
wounded
among
the
refugees
this
part
of
the
palais
is
also
a
hospital
with
separate
wards
for
men
for
women
and
children
and
for
special
cases
late
in
the
evening
p
took
the
whole
corps
to
see
the
palais
des
fêtes
and
i
went
again
by
night
i
suppose
it
is
even
more
than
it
was
by
day
in
the
darkness
the
gardens
have
taken
on
some
malign
mystery
and
have
given
it
to
the
multitudes
that
move
there
that
turn
in
the
winding
paths
among
ghostly
flowers
and
bushes
that
approach
and
recede
and
approach
in
the
darkness
of
the
lawns
blurred
by
the
darkness
and
diminished
to
the
barest
indications
of
humanity
their
forms
are
more
piteous
and
forlorn
than
ever
their
faces
thrown
up
by
the
darkness
more
awful
in
their
blankness
and
their
pallor
the
scene
drenched
in
darkness
is
unearthly
and
unintelligible
you
can
not
account
for
it
in
saying
to
yourself
that
these
are
the
refugees
and
everybody
knows
what
a
refugee
is
that
there
is
war
and
everybody
knows
what
war
is
in
belgium
and
that
these
people
have
been
shelled
out
of
their
homes
and
are
here
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
because
there
is
no
other
place
for
them
and
the
kind
citizens
of
ghent
have
undertaken
to
house
and
feed
them
here
that
does
make
it
one
bit
more
credible
or
bring
you
nearer
to
the
secret
of
these
forms
you
who
are
compelled
to
move
with
them
in
the
sinister
darkness
are
more
than
ever
under
the
spell
that
forbids
you
and
them
to
feel
you
are
deadened
now
to
the
touch
of
the
incarnate
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
near
the
door
of
the
palais
some
ghostly
roses
are
growing
on
a
ghostly
tree
your
guide
p
pauses
to
tell
you
their
names
and
kind
it
seems
that
they
are
rare
several
hundred
more
refugees
have
come
into
the
palais
since
the
afternoon
they
have
had
to
pack
them
a
little
closer
in
the
straw
eight
thousand
were
fed
this
evening
in
the
inner
hall
in
the
crush
i
get
separated
from
p
and
from
the
corps
i
see
some
of
them
in
the
distance
the
commandant
and
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
and
p
i
do
not
feel
as
if
i
belonged
to
them
any
more
i
belong
so
much
to
the
stunned
sleepers
in
the
straw
who
can
not
feel
nice
wilson
comes
across
to
me
and
we
go
round
together
looking
at
the
sleepers
he
says
that
nothing
he
has
seen
of
the
war
has
moved
him
so
much
as
this
sight
he
wishes
that
the
kaiser
could
be
brought
here
to
see
what
he
has
done
and
i
find
myself
clenching
my
hands
tight
till
it
hurts
not
to
suppress
my
feelings
for
i
feel
nothing
but
because
i
am
afraid
that
kind
wilson
is
going
to
talk
at
the
same
time
i
would
rather
he
did
leave
me
just
yet
there
is
a
sort
of
comfort
and
protection
in
being
with
somebody
who
is
callous
who
can
really
feel
but
wilson
is
very
fluent
and
presently
he
leaves
off
talking
too
near
the
door
we
pass
the
family
with
the
little
dog
all
day
the
little
dog
slept
in
their
place
and
now
that
they
are
trying
to
sleep
he
will
not
let
them
the
little
dog
is
wide
awake
and
walking
all
over
them
and
when
you
think
what
it
must
have
cost
to
bring
him
triste
pas
as
we
left
the
gardens
p
gathered
two
ghostly
roses
the
last
left
on
their
tree
and
gave
one
to
lambert
and
one
to
me
i
felt
something
rather
like
a
pang
then
heaven
knows
why
for
such
a
little
thing
conference
in
our
the
belgian
red
cross
guide
who
goes
out
with
our
ambulances
is
there
he
is
very
serious
and
important
the
commandant
calls
us
to
come
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
it
seems
it
had
been
arranged
that
one
of
our
cars
should
be
sent
morning
to
termonde
to
bring
back
refugees
but
does
not
think
that
car
will
ever
start
he
says
that
the
germans
are
now
within
a
few
miles
of
ghent
and
may
be
expected
to
occupy
it
morning
and
that
instead
of
going
to
termonde
we
had
very
much
better
pack
up
and
retreat
to
bruges
there
are
ten
thousand
germans
ready
to
march
into
ghent
is
weighed
down
by
the
thought
of
his
ten
thousand
germans
but
the
commandant
is
not
weighed
down
a
bit
on
the
contrary
a
pleasant
exaltation
comes
upon
him
it
comes
upon
the
whole
corps
it
comes
even
upon
me
we
refuse
to
believe
in
his
ten
thousand
germans
himself
can
not
swear
to
them
we
refuse
to
pack
up
we
refuse
to
retreat
to
bruges
time
enough
for
agitation
in
the
morning
we
prefer
to
go
to
bed
shrugs
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
has
done
his
duty
and
if
we
are
all
murdered
in
our
beds
it
is
his
fault
does
really
believe
in
the
advance
of
the
ten
thousand
his
face
is
inscrutable
no
germans
in
ghent
no
germans
reported
near
ghent
madame
and
her
daughter
smile
at
the
idea
of
the
germans
coming
into
ghent
they
will
never
come
and
if
they
do
come
they
will
only
take
a
little
food
and
go
out
again
they
will
never
do
any
harm
to
ghent
namur
and
liége
and
brussels
if
you
like
and
malines
and
louvain
and
termonde
and
antwerp
perhaps
but
ghent
why
should
they
it
is
antwerp
they
are
making
for
not
ghent
and
madame
represents
the
mind
of
the
average
gantois
it
is
placid
incredulous
stolidly
at
ease
superbly
inhospitable
to
disagreeable
ideas
no
gantois
can
conceive
that
what
has
been
done
to
the
citizens
of
termonde
would
be
done
to
him
what
has
been
done
to
the
citizens
of
termonde
but
it
does
shake
his
belief
in
the
immunity
of
ghent
which
makes
behaviour
all
the
more
mysterious
did
he
try
to
scare
us
so
five
theories
are
tenable
did
honestly
believe
that
ten
thousand
germans
would
come
in
the
morning
and
take
our
ambulance
prisoner
that
is
to
say
he
believed
what
nobody
else
believed
was
scared
himself
he
had
no
desire
to
be
taken
quite
so
near
the
as
the
english
ambulance
seemed
likely
to
take
him
so
that
the
departure
of
the
english
ambulance
would
not
be
wholly
disagreeable
to
this
theory
is
too
was
the
agent
of
the
military
power
commissioned
to
test
the
nerve
of
the
english
ambulance
stood
fire
have
they
give
a
scare
and
see
how
they
behave
is
a
psychologist
and
made
this
little
experiment
on
the
english
ambulance
himself
he
is
a
humorist
and
was
simply
pulling
its
leg
the
three
last
theories
are
plausible
but
all
five
collapse
before
the
inscrutability
of
monsieur
face
germans
or
no
germans
one
ambulance
car
started
at
five
in
the
morning
for
quatrecht
somewhere
between
ghent
and
brussels
to
fetch
wounded
and
refugees
the
other
went
later
to
zele
i
am
not
very
clear
as
to
who
has
gone
with
them
but
torrence
lambert
janet
mcneil
and
haynes
and
riley
have
been
left
behind
it
is
their
third
day
of
inactivity
and
three
months
of
it
could
not
have
devastated
them
more
they
have
touched
the
very
bottom
of
suicidal
gloom
three
months
hence
their
state
of
mind
will
no
doubt
appear
in
all
its
absurdity
but
at
the
moment
it
is
too
piteous
for
words
when
you
think
what
they
were
yesterday
and
the
day
before
there
is
no
language
to
express
the
crescendo
of
their
despair
i
came
upon
riley
this
morning
standing
by
the
window
of
the
and
contemplating
the
façade
of
the
railway
station
it
is
making
a
pattern
on
our
brains
i
tried
to
soothe
him
i
said
it
was
hard
lines
beastly
hard
lines
and
told
him
to
cheer
up
there
be
heaps
for
him
to
do
presently
and
he
turned
from
me
like
a
man
who
has
just
buried
his
janet
mcneil
is
even
more
sunk
in
a
chair
with
her
hands
stuck
into
the
immense
pockets
of
her
overcoat
her
flawless
and
impassive
face
tilted
forward
as
her
head
droops
forlornly
to
her
breast
she
is
such
a
child
that
she
can
see
nothing
beyond
and
yesterday
and
the
day
before
that
she
is
going
back
her
valour
and
energy
are
frustrated
and
she
is
wounded
in
her
honour
she
is
conscious
of
the
rottenness
of
putting
on
a
khaki
tunic
and
winding
khaki
putties
round
and
round
her
legs
to
hang
about
the
hospital
doing
nothing
and
she
had
to
sell
her
motor
bicycle
in
order
to
come
out
not
that
that
matters
in
the
least
what
matters
is
that
we
are
here
eating
belgian
food
and
quartered
in
a
belgian
military
hospital
and
swanking
about
with
belgian
red
cross
brassards
stamped
on
our
sleeves
and
doing
nothing
for
the
belgians
doing
nothing
for
anybody
we
are
not
justifying
our
existence
we
are
frauds
i
tell
the
poor
child
that
she
can
not
possibly
feel
as
big
a
fraud
as
i
do
that
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
i
should
have
come
and
none
whatever
why
i
should
remain
and
then
to
my
amazement
i
learn
that
i
am
envied
it
all
right
for
me
my
job
is
clearly
defined
and
nobody
can
take
it
from
me
i
got
to
wind
khaki
putties
round
my
legs
for
nothing
i
should
have
thought
that
the
child
was
making
jokes
at
my
expense
but
for
the
extreme
purity
and
candour
of
her
gaze
incredible
that
there
should
exist
an
abasement
profounder
than
my
own
i
have
hidden
my
tunic
and
breeches
in
my
i
dare
not
own
to
having
brought
them
down
in
the
vestibule
i
encounter
torrence
in
khaki
torrence
yearning
for
her
wounded
torrence
determined
to
get
to
her
wounded
at
any
cost
she
is
not
abased
or
dejected
but
exalted
rather
she
is
ready
to
go
to
the
president
or
to
the
military
power
itself
and
demand
her
wounded
from
them
her
beautiful
eyes
demand
them
from
heaven
itself
i
can
not
say
there
are
not
enough
wounded
to
go
round
but
i
point
out
for
the
fifteenth
time
that
the
trouble
is
there
are
not
enough
ambulance
cars
to
go
round
but
it
is
no
use
it
does
not
explain
why
heaven
should
have
chosen
ursula
dearmer
and
caused
shells
to
bound
in
her
direction
and
have
rejected
torrence
the
military
power
that
should
have
ordered
these
things
has
abandoned
us
to
the
caprice
of
heaven
of
course
if
torrence
was
a
saint
she
would
fold
her
hands
and
bow
her
superb
little
head
before
the
decrees
of
heaven
but
she
is
only
a
mortal
woman
born
with
the
genius
of
succour
and
trained
to
the
last
point
of
efficiency
so
she
rages
the
tigress
robbed
of
her
young
is
not
more
furiously
inconsolable
than
torrence
it
is
not
ursula
dearmer
fault
she
is
innocent
of
supplanting
torrence
the
thing
simply
happened
more
docile
than
determined
unhurrying
and
uneager
and
only
she
seems
to
have
rolled
into
car
no
with
heaven
impetus
behind
her
like
the
shell
at
alost
it
is
her
luck
and
on
the
rest
of
us
our
futility
and
frustration
weigh
like
lead
the
good
belgian
food
has
become
bitter
in
our
mouths
when
we
took
our
miserable
walk
through
ghent
this
morning
we
felt
that
must
be
a
mark
for
public
hatred
and
derision
because
of
us
i
declare
i
hardly
dare
go
into
the
shops
with
the
red
cross
brassard
on
my
arm
i
imagine
sardonic
raillery
in
the
eyes
of
every
belgian
that
i
meet
we
do
not
think
the
authorities
will
stand
it
much
longer
they
will
fire
us
out
of
the
no
ii
but
no
the
authorities
do
not
fire
us
out
impassive
in
wisdom
and
foreknowledge
they
smile
benignly
on
our
agitation
they
compliment
the
english
ambulance
on
the
work
it
has
done
already
they
convey
the
impression
that
but
for
the
english
ambulance
the
belgian
army
would
be
in
a
bad
way
mademoiselle
insists
that
the
hospital
will
soon
be
overflowing
with
the
wounded
from
antwerp
and
that
she
can
find
work
even
for
me
it
is
untrue
that
there
are
three
hundred
nurses
in
the
hospital
there
are
only
three
hundred
nurses
in
all
belgium
they
pile
it
on
so
that
we
are
more
depressed
than
ever
janet
mcneil
is
convinced
that
they
think
we
are
no
good
and
that
they
are
just
being
angels
to
us
because
they
are
sorry
for
us
i
break
it
to
them
very
gently
that
i
volunteered
to
serve
at
the
tables
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
i
feel
as
if
i
had
sneaked
into
a
remunerative
job
while
my
comrades
are
starving
the
commandant
is
not
quite
as
pleased
as
i
thought
he
would
be
to
hear
of
my
engagement
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
he
says
it
is
not
your
work
i
insist
that
my
work
is
to
do
anything
i
can
do
and
that
if
i
can
not
dress
wounds
i
can
at
least
hand
round
bread
and
pour
out
coffee
and
wash
up
dishes
it
is
true
that
i
am
secretary
and
reporter
and
for
the
time
being
treasurer
to
the
ambulance
and
that
i
carry
its
funds
in
a
leather
purse
belt
round
my
body
because
i
am
the
smallest
and
weakest
member
of
the
corps
that
is
the
most
unlikely
place
for
the
funds
to
be
it
was
imprudent
to
say
the
least
of
it
for
the
chaplain
in
his
khaki
to
carry
them
as
he
did
into
the
the
belt
which
fitted
the
chaplain
hangs
about
half
a
yard
below
my
waist
and
is
extremely
uncomfortable
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
keeping
the
corps
accounts
only
takes
two
hours
and
a
half
even
with
belgian
and
english
money
mixed
and
when
i
added
the
same
column
of
figures
ten
times
up
and
ten
times
down
to
make
certain
it
all
right
i
am
no
good
at
accounts
but
i
know
my
weakness
and
guard
against
it
giving
the
corps
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
and
making
good
every
deficit
out
of
my
private
purse
writing
the
perhaps
half
an
hour
the
commandant
correspondence
when
he
has
any
and
reporting
to
the
british
red
cross
society
when
there
is
anything
to
report
another
at
the
outside
and
there
you
have
only
three
and
a
half
hours
employed
out
of
the
even
if
i
balanced
my
accounts
every
day
and
i
do
true
that
daily
promised
to
take
any
articles
that
i
might
send
them
from
the
front
but
i
have
written
any
you
can
not
write
articles
for
daily
out
of
nothing
at
least
i
ca
the
commandant
finally
yields
to
argument
and
entreaty
i
do
not
tell
him
that
what
i
really
want
to
do
is
to
go
out
with
the
field
ambulance
and
get
beyond
the
turn
of
that
road
i
know
i
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
i
know
that
if
i
had
as
things
stand
at
present
not
being
a
surgeon
or
a
trained
nurse
i
take
it
even
to
get
there
and
at
the
same
time
i
know
with
a
superior
certainty
that
this
unlikely
thing
will
happen
this
sense
of
certainty
is
not
at
all
uncommon
but
it
is
or
seems
unintelligible
you
can
only
conceive
it
as
a
premonition
of
some
unavoidable
event
it
is
as
if
something
had
been
looking
for
you
waiting
for
you
from
all
eternity
out
here
something
that
you
have
been
looking
for
and
when
you
are
getting
near
it
begins
calling
to
you
it
draws
your
heart
out
to
it
all
day
long
you
can
give
no
account
of
it
all
that
you
know
about
it
is
that
it
is
unique
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
ordinary
curiosities
and
interests
and
loves
nothing
to
do
with
the
thirst
for
experience
or
for
adventure
or
for
glory
or
for
the
thrill
you
get
anything
out
of
it
it
is
something
hidden
and
secret
and
supremely
urgent
its
urgency
indeed
is
so
great
that
if
you
miss
it
you
will
have
missed
reality
itself
for
me
this
uncanny
anticipation
is
somehow
connected
with
the
turn
of
the
road
i
do
not
see
how
i
am
ever
going
to
get
there
or
anywhere
near
there
but
i
am
not
uneasy
or
impatient
any
more
there
is
no
hurry
the
thing
whatever
it
is
will
be
irresistible
and
if
i
do
go
out
to
find
it
it
will
find
me
torrence
has
gone
heaven
knows
where
she
has
not
been
with
the
others
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
janet
mcneil
and
lambert
have
been
working
there
for
five
hours
serving
meals
to
the
refugees
ursula
dearmer
with
extreme
docility
has
been
working
all
the
afternoon
with
the
nurses
it
looks
as
if
we
were
beginning
to
settle
down
torrence
has
come
back
the
red
german
has
gone
from
her
cap
and
she
wears
the
badge
of
the
belgian
motor
cyclist
corps
black
wings
on
a
white
ground
providence
has
rehabilitated
himself
he
has
abased
our
trained
nurse
and
expert
motorist
in
order
to
exalt
her
he
fairly
flung
her
in
the
path
of
the
colonel
of
i
think
the
belgian
motor
cyclist
corps
at
a
moment
when
the
colonel
found
himself
in
a
jibbing
without
a
chauffeur
we
gather
that
the
colonel
was
becoming
hectic
with
blasphemy
when
she
appeared
and
settled
the
little
difficulty
between
him
and
his
car
she
seems
to
have
followed
it
up
by
driving
him
then
and
there
straight
up
to
the
to
look
for
wounded
end
of
the
adventure
she
volunteered
her
services
as
chauffeur
to
the
colonel
and
was
accepted
the
commandant
has
received
the
news
with
imperturbable
optimism
as
for
her
she
is
appeased
she
will
realize
her
valorous
dream
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
and
she
will
get
to
her
wounded
the
others
have
come
back
too
they
have
toiled
for
five
hours
among
the
refugees
it
is
my
turn
now
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
it
took
ages
to
get
in
the
is
narrower
than
the
but
it
extends
beyond
it
on
one
side
where
there
is
a
large
door
opening
on
the
garden
but
this
door
is
closed
to
the
public
you
can
only
reach
the
by
going
through
the
straw
among
the
sleepers
and
at
this
point
the
commandant
optimism
has
broken
down
he
wo
let
you
go
in
through
the
straw
and
the
clerk
who
controls
the
entry
wo
let
you
go
in
through
the
other
door
you
explain
to
the
clerk
that
the
english
ambulance
being
quartered
in
a
military
hospital
its
rules
are
inviolable
it
is
not
allowed
to
expose
itself
to
the
horrors
of
the
straw
the
clerk
is
not
interested
in
the
english
ambulance
he
is
not
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
has
volunteered
its
priceless
services
to
the
refugee
committee
and
he
is
contemptuous
of
the
orders
of
its
commandant
his
business
is
to
see
that
you
go
into
the
palais
through
door
and
not
through
any
other
door
and
when
you
tell
him
that
if
he
will
not
withdraw
his
regulations
the
ambulance
will
be
compelled
to
withdraw
its
services
he
replies
with
delicious
sarcasm
pas
prévu
in
the
end
you
are
referred
to
the
secretary
in
his
bureau
he
grasps
the
situation
and
is
urbanity
itself
provided
with
a
special
permit
bearing
his
sacred
signature
you
are
admitted
by
the
other
door
your
passage
to
the
takes
you
through
the
infants
room
and
along
the
galleries
past
the
wards
the
crowd
of
refugees
is
so
great
that
beds
have
been
put
up
in
the
galleries
you
take
off
your
outer
garments
and
put
on
the
belgian
red
cross
uniform
you
have
realized
by
this
time
that
your
charming
white
overall
and
veil
are
sanitary
precautions
coming
down
the
wide
wooden
stairways
you
have
a
full
view
of
the
inner
hall
this
enormous
oblong
space
below
the
galleries
is
the
heart
the
fervid
central
of
the
palais
des
fêtes
at
either
end
of
it
is
an
immense
auditorium
tier
above
tier
of
seats
rising
towards
the
gallery
floors
all
down
each
side
of
it
standards
with
triumphal
devices
are
tilted
from
the
balustrade
banners
hang
from
the
rafters
and
under
them
down
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
from
auditorium
to
auditorium
the
tables
are
set
out
bare
wooden
tables
one
after
another
more
tables
than
you
can
count
from
the
door
of
the
to
each
auditorium
and
from
each
auditorium
down
the
line
of
the
tables
a
gangway
is
roped
off
for
the
passage
of
the
refugees
they
say
there
are
ten
thousand
five
hundred
here
beyond
the
along
the
inner
hall
more
straw
has
been
laid
down
to
bed
the
overflow
from
the
outer
hall
they
come
on
in
relays
to
be
fed
they
are
marshalled
first
into
the
seats
of
each
auditorium
where
they
sit
like
the
spectators
of
some
monstrous
festival
and
wait
for
their
turn
at
the
tables
this
the
long
procession
of
people
streaming
in
without
haste
in
perfect
order
and
submission
is
if
you
like
the
immensity
of
the
crowd
no
longer
overpowers
you
the
barriers
make
it
a
steady
procession
a
credible
spectacle
you
can
take
it
in
it
is
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
in
your
heart
they
come
on
so
slowly
that
you
can
count
them
as
they
come
they
have
sorted
themselves
out
the
fathers
and
the
mothers
are
together
they
lead
their
little
children
by
the
hand
or
push
them
gently
before
them
there
is
no
anticipation
in
their
eyes
no
eagerness
and
no
impatience
in
their
bearing
they
do
not
hustle
each
other
or
scramble
for
their
places
it
is
their
silence
and
submission
that
you
can
not
stand
for
you
have
a
moment
of
dreadful
inactivity
after
the
setting
of
the
tables
for
the
you
have
filled
your
bowls
with
black
coffee
somebody
else
has
laid
the
slices
of
white
bread
on
the
bare
tables
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
stand
still
and
see
them
file
in
to
the
banquet
on
the
banners
and
standards
from
the
roof
and
balustrades
the
lion
of
flanders
ramps
over
their
heads
and
somewhere
in
the
back
of
your
brain
a
song
sings
itself
to
a
tune
that
something
in
your
brain
wakes
up
ne
vont
pas
dompter
le
vieux
lion
de
flandres
tant
que
le
lion
a
des
dents
tant
que
le
lion
peut
it
is
the
song
the
belgian
soldiers
sang
as
they
marched
to
battle
in
the
first
week
of
august
it
is
only
the
end
of
september
now
and
somebody
standing
beside
you
says
triste
pas
you
can
not
look
any
more
at
the
canteen
the
men
are
pouring
out
coffee
from
enormous
enamelled
jugs
into
the
small
jugs
that
the
waitresses
bring
this
wastes
your
time
and
cools
the
coffee
so
you
take
a
big
jug
from
the
men
it
seems
to
you
no
heavier
than
an
ordinary
teapot
and
you
run
with
it
to
carry
the
largest
possible
jug
at
the
swiftest
possible
pace
is
your
only
chance
of
keeping
sane
it
is
till
it
is
all
over
that
you
hear
the
whisper
of
and
realize
how
very
far
from
sane
you
must
have
looked
running
round
with
your
enormous
jug
you
can
fill
up
the
coffee
bowls
again
the
little
bowls
full
the
big
bowls
only
half
full
there
is
more
than
enough
coffee
to
go
round
but
there
is
no
milk
except
for
the
babies
and
when
they
ask
you
for
more
bread
there
is
not
enough
to
go
twice
round
the
ration
is
now
two
slices
of
dry
bread
and
a
bowl
of
black
coffee
three
times
a
day
till
yesterday
there
was
an
allowance
of
meat
for
soup
at
the
meal
the
army
has
commandeered
all
the
meat
but
you
need
stand
still
any
more
after
the
first
service
the
bowls
have
to
be
cleared
from
the
tables
and
washed
and
laid
ready
for
the
next
round
the
great
wooden
tubs
there
is
a
frightful
competition
it
is
who
can
wash
and
dry
and
carry
back
the
quickest
you
contend
with
brawny
flemish
women
for
the
first
dip
into
the
tub
and
the
driest
towel
then
you
race
round
the
tables
with
your
pile
of
crockery
and
then
with
your
jug
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
for
three
hours
till
the
last
relay
is
fed
and
the
tables
are
deserted
you
wash
up
again
and
it
is
all
over
for
you
till
six
evening
you
go
back
to
your
and
a
supper
of
cold
coffee
and
sandwiches
and
belgian
current
loaf
eaten
with
butter
and
in
a
nightmare
afterwards
belgian
refugees
gather
round
you
and
pluck
at
your
sleeve
and
cry
to
you
for
more
bread
petite

vous

mademoiselle
no
germans
nor
sign
of
germans
yet
fighting
is
reported
at
saint
nicolas
between
antwerp
and
ghent
the
commandant
has
an
idea
he
says
that
if
the
belgian
army
has
to
meet
the
germans
at
saint
nicolas
so
as
to
cut
off
their
advance
on
antwerp
the
base
hospital
must
be
removed
from
ghent
to
some
centre
or
point
which
will
bring
the
ambulance
behind
the
belgian
lines
he
thinks
that
working
from
ghent
would
necessarily
bring
it
behind
the
german
lines
this
is
assuming
that
the
germans
coming
up
from
the
will
cut
in
between
saint
nicolas
and
ghent
he
consults
the
president
who
apparently
thinks
that
the
base
hospital
will
do
very
well
where
it
is
torrence
brought
her
colonel
in
to
lunch
he
is
battered
and
grizzled
but
still
a
fine
figure
in
the
uniform
of
the
motor
cyclist
corps
he
is
very
polite
and
gallant
la
and
vows
that
he
has
taken
on
torrence
toujours
pour
la
she
diverts
the
flow
of
urbanity
adroitly
except
the
colonel
nothing
noteworthy
seems
to
have
occurred
the
three
hours
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
were
like
the
three
hours
last
night
october
it
really
is
safe
for
the
commandant
to
go
out
with
ursula
dearmer
for
her
luck
in
the
matter
of
bombardments
continues
he
might
just
as
well
be
with
mrs
torrence
they
have
been
at
termonde
what
is
more
it
was
ursula
dearmer
who
got
them
through
in
spite
of
the
medical
military
officer
whose
vigorous
efforts
stopped
them
at
the
barrier
he
seems
at
one
point
to
have
shown
weakness
and
given
them
leave
to
go
on
a
little
way
up
the
road
and
the
little
way
seems
to
have
carried
them
out
of
his
sight
and
onward
till
they
encountered
the
colonel
or
it
may
have
been
a
general
in
command
the
colonel
or
the
general
seems
to
have
broken
down
very
badly
for
the
car
and
ursula
dearmer
and
the
commandant
went
on
towards
termonde
young
haynes
was
with
them
this
time
and
on
the
way
they
had
picked
up
l
war
correspondent
to
the
and
they
left
the
car
behind
somewhere
in
a
safe
place
where
the
fire
from
the
reach
it
there
is
a
street
or
a
road
i
ca
make
out
whether
it
is
inside
or
outside
the
town
it
leads
straight
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
which
is
about
as
wide
there
as
the
thames
at
westminster
the
bridge
is
the
key
to
the
position
it
has
been
blown
up
and
built
again
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
war
and
the
germans
are
now
entrenched
beyond
it
the
road
had
been
raked
by
their
the
day
before
it
seems
to
have
struck
the
four
simultaneously
that
it
would
be
quite
a
good
thing
to
walk
down
this
road
on
the
of
the
opening
fire
again
the
tale
told
by
the
commandant
evokes
an
awful
vision
of
them
walking
down
it
four
abreast
the
commandant
and
l
on
the
outside
fairly
under
shelter
and
ursula
dearmer
and
young
haynes
a
little
in
front
of
them
down
the
middle
where
the
fire
comes
when
it
does
come
this
spectacle
seems
to
have
shaken
the
commandant
in
his
view
of
bombarded
towns
as
suitable
places
of
amusement
for
young
girls
young
haynes
ought
to
have
known
better
you
tell
him
that
as
long
as
the
world
endures
young
haynes
will
be
young
haynes
and
if
there
is
danger
in
the
middle
of
the
road
it
is
there
that
he
will
walk
by
preference
and
as
no
young
woman
of
modern
times
is
going
to
let
herself
be
outdone
by
young
haynes
you
must
expect
to
find
ursula
dearmer
in
the
middle
of
the
road
too
you
can
not
suppress
this
competitive
heroism
of
young
people
the
roots
strike
too
deep
down
in
human
nature
in
the
modern
young
man
and
woman
competitive
heroism
has
completely
forgotten
its
origin
and
is
now
an
end
in
itself
and
if
it
comes
to
that
how
about
alost
at
the
mention
of
alost
the
commandant
face
becomes
childlike
again
in
its
utter
simplicity
and
innocence
and
candour
alost
was
a
very
different
thing
looking
for
shells
at
alost
you
understand
was
like
looking
for
shells
on
the
seashore
at
alost
ursula
dearmer
was
in
no
sort
of
danger
for
at
alost
she
was
under
the
commandant
wing
young
haynes
has
got
any
wings
only
legs
to
walk
into
the
line
of
fire
on
he
explains
very
carefully
that
he
took
her
under
his
wing
she
is
a
young
girl
and
he
feels
responsible
for
her
to
her
mother
which
oddly
enough
is
just
how
feel
as
for
young
haynes
i
suppose
he
would
plead
that
when
he
and
ursula
dearmer
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
road
there
was
no
firing
that
seems
to
have
been
young
haynes
particular
good
fortune
i
have
now
a
perfect
obsession
of
responsibility
i
see
in
one
dreadful
vision
after
another
the
things
that
must
happen
to
ursula
dearmer
under
the
commandant
wing
and
to
young
haynes
and
the
commandant
under
ursula
dearmer
no
wounded
were
found
this
time
at
termonde
this
little
with
the
commandant
has
made
me
forget
to
record
a
far
more
notable
event
torrence
brought
young
lieutenant
g
in
to
luncheon
he
is
the
hero
of
the
belgian
motor
cyclist
corps
he
is
said
to
have
accounted
for
nine
germans
with
his
own
rifle
in
one
morning
the
corps
has
already
intimated
that
this
is
the
first
specimen
of
a
man
it
has
yet
seen
in
belgium
his
uniform
fits
him
exceedingly
well
he
is
tall
and
handsome
drenched
in
the
glamour
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
he
gives
it
off
like
a
subtle
essence
as
he
was
led
in
he
had
rather
the
air
the
slightly
awkward
puzzled
and
embarrassed
air
of
being
on
show
as
a
fine
specimen
of
a
man
but
it
very
soon
wore
off
in
the
absence
of
the
commandant
he
sat
in
the
commandant
place
so
magnificent
a
figure
that
our
mess
with
gaps
at
every
table
looked
like
a
banquet
given
in
his
honour
a
banquet
whose
guests
had
been
decimated
by
some
catastrophe
suddenly
whether
it
was
the
presence
of
the
lieutenant
or
the
absence
of
the
commandant
or
merely
reaction
from
the
strain
of
inactivity
i
do
know
but
suddenly
madness
came
upon
our
mess
the
was
no
longer
a
in
a
military
hospital
but
a
british
torrence
had
changed
her
woollen
cap
for
a
grey
felt
she
was
no
longer
an
arctic
explorer
but
the
cowboy
of
british
melodrama
she
was
the
first
to
go
mad
one
moment
she
was
seated
decorously
at
the
lieutenant
right
hand
the
next
she
was
strolling
round
the
tables
with
an
air
of
innocent
abstraction
having
armed
herself
in
secret
with
the
little
hard
round
rolls
supplied
by
order
of
the
commandant
each
little
roll
became
a
deadly
in
her
hand
she
turned
her
innocent
abstraction
was
intense
as
she
poised
herself
to
aim
with
a
shout
of
laughter
bird
ducked
behind
the
cover
of
his
i
had
a
sudden
memory
of
torrence
in
command
of
the
party
at
ostend
a
figure
of
austere
duty
of
inexorable
propriety
rigid
with
the
discipline
of
the
hospital
restraining
the
criminal
levity
of
the
red
cross
volunteer
who
would
look
or
dream
of
looking
at
ostend
cathedral
torrence
like
a
child
meditating
mischief
like
a
baby
panther
at
play
like
a
very
young
and
very
engaging
demon
let
loose
is
looking
at
bird
he
is
not
a
cathedral
but
he
suffered
bombardment
all
the
same
she
got
his
range
with
a
roll
she
landed
her
shell
in
the
very
centre
of
his
waistcoat
her
madness
entered
into
bird
he
replied
with
a
spirited
fire
which
fell
wide
of
her
and
battered
the
door
the
orderlies
retreated
for
shelter
into
the
vestibule
beyond
jean
was
the
first
to
penetrate
the
line
of
fire
max
followed
him
madness
entered
into
max
he
ceased
to
be
a
hospital
orderly
he
became
prosper
panne
again
the
very
young
as
he
put
down
his
dishes
and
glided
unobtrusively
into
the
affair
and
then
the
young
belgian
lieutenant
went
mad
but
he
gave
way
by
degrees
at
first
he
sat
up
straight
and
stiff
with
polite
astonishment
before
the
spectacle
of
a
british
rag
he
paid
the
dubious
tribute
of
a
weak
giggle
to
the
bombardment
of
bird
he
was
convulsed
at
the
first
performance
of
prosper
panne
in
his
final
collapse
he
was
rocking
to
and
fro
and
crowing
with
helpless
hysterical
laughter
for
with
the
entrance
of
prosper
panne
the
became
a
scene
at
the
there
was
torrence
in
the
costume
of
a
cowboy
there
was
the
young
lieutenant
himself
looking
like
a
in
the
uniform
of
the
belgian
motor
cyclist
corps
and
there
was
prosper
panne
he
began
by
picking
up
torrence
brown
leather
motor
glove
with
its
huge
gauntlet
and
examining
it
with
the
deliciously
foolish
bewilderment
of
the
accomplished
clown
after
one
or
two
failures
brilliantly
improvised
he
fixed
it
firmly
on
his
head
the
huge
gauntlet
with
its
limp
five
fingers
dangling
over
his
left
ear
became
a
rakish
képi
with
a
flap
max
i
mean
prosper
panne
wore
it
with
an
out
of
his
round
soft
face
he
made
fifteen
other
faces
in
rapid
succession
all
incomparably
absurd
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
held
it
between
his
lower
lip
and
his
chin
the
effect
was
of
a
miraculous
transformation
of
those
features
in
which
his
upper
lip
disappeared
altogether
his
lower
lip
took
on
its
functions
while
his
chin
ceased
to
be
a
chin
and
became
a
lower
lip
with
this
achievement
prosper
panne
had
his
audience
in
the
hollow
of
his
hands
he
could
do
what
he
liked
with
it
he
did
he
caused
his
cap
to
fall
from
his
head
as
if
by
some
mysterious
movement
of
its
own
then
he
went
round
the
stalls
and
gravely
and
earnestly
removed
all
our
hats
with
an
air
more
and
more
he
wore
each
one
of
them
in
turn
the
grey
felt
of
the
cowboy
the
knitted
jaeger
of
the
little
arctic
explorer
the
military
cap
with
the
red
tassel
assumed
by
bird
even
the
green
cap
with
the
winged
symbol
of
the
young
belgian
officer
by
this
time
the
young
belgian
officer
was
so
entirely
the
thrall
of
prosper
panne
that
he
did
turn
a
hair
flushed
with
success
max
rose
to
his
moving
slowly
towards
the
open
door
centre
with
his
back
to
his
audience
and
his
head
turned
towards
it
over
his
left
shoulder
by
some
extraordinary
dislocation
of
his
he
achieved
the
immemorial
salutation
of
the
the
last
faint
survival
of
the
old
athenian
comedy
up
till
now
jean
had
affected
to
ignore
the
performance
of
his
colleague
but
under
this
supreme
provocation
he
yielded
to
the
aristophanic
impulse
and
max
in
the
approved
manner
of
the
it
is
all
over
the
young
belgian
officer
has
flown
away
on
his
motor
cycle
to
pot
germans
torrence
has
gone
off
to
the
field
with
the
colonel
on
the
quest
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
the
ambulance
has
followed
them
there
i
am
in
the
sitting
at
the
disordered
table
and
gazing
at
the
ruins
of
our
mess
i
hear
again
the
wild
laughter
of
the
it
mingles
with
the
cry
of
the
refugees
in
the
palais
des
fêtes
petite
tranche
de
pain
vous
plaît
mademoiselle
triste
pas
in
the
chair
by
the
window
max
lies
back
with
his
loose
boyish
legs
extended
limply
in
front
of
him
his
round
head
droops
to
his
shoulder
his
round
face
the
face
of
a
very
young
is
white
the
features
are
blurred
and
inert
max
is
asleep
with
his
in
his
hand
in
the
sudden
pathetic
sleep
of
exhaustion
after
his
brief
funny
madness
he
is
asleep
jean
comes
and
looks
at
him
and
shakes
his
head
you
understand
from
jean
that
max
goes
mad
like
that
now
and
then
on
purpose
so
that
he
may
forget
in
what
manner
his
mother
went
mad
we
go
quietly
so
as
not
to
wake
him
a
minute
too
soon
lest
when
he
wakes
he
should
remember
there
is
a
taube
hovering
over
ghent
up
there
in
the
clear
blue
sky
it
looks
innocent
like
an
enormous
greyish
blond
hovering
over
a
pond
you
stare
at
it
fascinated
as
you
stare
at
a
hawk
that
hangs
in
steadied
by
the
vibration
of
its
wings
watching
its
prey
you
are
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
watching
taube
an
aeroplane
dropping
a
few
bombs
is
nothing
to
what
goes
on
down
there
where
the
ambulances
are
the
ambulances
have
come
back
i
go
out
into
the
yard
to
look
at
them
they
are
not
always
nice
to
look
at
the
floors
and
steps
would
make
you
shudder
if
you
were
not
past
shuddering
i
have
found
something
to
do
not
much
but
still
something
i
am
to
look
after
the
linen
for
the
ambulances
to
take
away
the
and
blankets
and
deliver
them
at
the
laundry
and
get
clean
ones
from
the
it
odd
but
i
almost
foolishly
elated
at
being
allowed
to
do
this
we
are
still
more
or
less
weighed
down
by
the
sense
of
our
uselessness
even
the
chaplain
though
his
services
as
a
have
been
definitely
recognized
even
the
chaplain
continues
to
suffer
in
this
way
he
has
just
come
to
me
to
tell
me
with
pride
that
he
is
making
a
good
job
of
the
stretchers
he
has
got
to
mend
then
just
as
i
am
beginning
to
lift
up
my
head
the
blow
falls
not
one
member
of
the
field
ambulance
corps
is
to
be
allowed
to
work
at
the
palais
des
fêtes
for
fear
of
bringing
fever
into
the
military
hospital
and
here
we
are
exactly
where
we
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
lambert
janet
mcneil
and
i
three
women
out
of
five
with
nothing
to
do
and
two
convalescent
orderlies
waiting
on
us
if
i
could
please
myself
i
would
tuck
max
up
in
bed
and
wait
on
in
spite
of
the
ambulance
linen
this
is
the
worst
day
of
all
for
the
wretched
secretary
and
reporter
five
days
in
ghent
and
not
a
thing
done
not
a
line
written
of
those
brilliant
articles
from
the
front
which
were
to
bring
in
money
for
the
corps
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
hang
about
the
hospital
on
the
of
the
commandant
coming
back
unexpectedly
and
wanting
a
letter
written
to
pass
the
man
with
the
bullet
wound
in
his
mouth
a
dozen
times
a
day
he
is
getting
very
slowly
better
his
poor
face
was
a
little
more
human
this
morning
to
see
the
maimed
and
crippled
men
trailing
and
hobbling
about
the
hall
and
the
wounded
carried
in
on
their
stretchers
dripping
stretchers
agonized
bodies
limbs
rolled
in
bandages
blood
oozing
through
the
bandages
heads
bound
with
bandages
bandages
glued
tight
to
the
bone
with
blood
to
see
all
this
and
be
utterly
powerless
to
help
to
endure
day
after
day
the
blank
blond
horror
of
the
empty
to
sit
before
a
table
with
a
bad
pen
never
enough
paper
and
hardly
any
ink
and
nothing
at
all
to
write
about
while
all
the
time
the
names
of
places
places
you
have
not
seen
and
never
will
see
termonde
alost
quatrecht
and
courtrai
go
on
sounding
in
your
brain
with
a
maddening
luring
reiteration
to
sit
in
a
hateful
inactivity
and
a
disgusting
an
intolerable
safety
and
to
be
haunted
by
a
vision
of
two
figures
intensely
clear
on
a
somewhat
vague
background
torrence
following
her
star
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
and
ursula
dearmer
wandering
in
youth
and
innocence
among
the
shells
to
be
obliged
to
think
of
ursula
dearmer
mother
when
you
would
much
rather
not
think
of
her
to
be
profoundly
and
irrevocably
angry
with
the
guileless
commandant
whom
at
the
moment
you
regard
it
may
be
perversely
as
the
prime
agent
in
this
fatuous
sacrifice
of
women
lives
to
want
to
stop
it
and
to
be
unable
to
stop
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
feel
a
brute
because
you
want
to
stop
it
when
are
enjoying
the
adventure
i
can
only
say
of
the
experience
that
i
hope
there
is
no
depth
of
futility
deeper
than
this
to
come
you
might
as
well
be
taken
prisoner
by
the
germans
better
since
that
would
at
least
give
you
something
to
write
about
afterwards
what
more
i
bored
when
i
told
the
commandant
all
this
he
looked
very
straight
at
me
and
said
then
you
better
come
with
us
to
termonde
so
straight
he
looked
that
the
suggestion
struck
me
less
as
a
offer
than
an
ironic
reference
to
my
five
weeks
funk
i
do
tell
him
that
that
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
do
that
his
wretched
reporter
nourishes
an
insane
ambition
not
to
become
a
special
correspondent
not
to
career
under
massive
headlines
in
the
columns
of
the
not
to
steal
a
march
on
other
war
correspondents
and
secure
the
one
glorious
scoop
of
the
campaign
not
any
of
these
sickly
and
insignificant
things
but
in
defiance
of
tom
the
chauffeur
to
go
out
with
the
field
ambulance
as
an
and
hunt
for
wounded
men
and
in
the
intervals
of
hunting
to
observe
the
orbit
of
a
shell
and
the
manner
of
shrapnel
in
descending
to
be
left
behind
every
day
in
an
empty
with
a
bad
pen
utterly
deprived
of
copy
or
of
any
substitute
for
copy
and
to
have
to
construct
war
articles
out
of
your
inner
consciousness
would
be
purgatory
for
a
journalist
but
to
have
a
mad
dream
in
your
soul
and
a
pair
of
breeches
in
your
and
to
see
no
possibility
of
sporting
either
is
the
very
refinement
of
hell
and
your
tortures
will
be
unbearable
if
at
the
same
time
you
have
to
hold
your
tongue
about
them
and
pretend
that
you
are
a
genuine
reporter
and
that
all
you
want
is
copy
and
your
utmost
aim
the
business
of
the
scoop
after
a
week
of
it
you
will
not
be
likely
to
look
with
crystal
clarity
on
other
people
lapses
from
precaution
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
tell
him
this
ten
to
one
he
would
believe
it
he
thinks
i
am
funking
all
the
time
i
am
still
very
angry
with
him
he
must
know
that
i
am
very
angry
i
think
that
somewhere
inside
him
he
is
rather
angry
too
all
the
same
he
has
come
to
me
and
asked
me
to
give
him
my
soap
he
says
max
has
taken
his
i
give
him
my
soap
but
these
oppressions
and
obsessions
the
deadly
anxiety
the
futile
responsibility
and
the
boredom
are
too
much
for
me
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
going
home
in
the
evening
we
the
commandant
and
janet
mcneil
and
i
went
down
to
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
to
see
the
war
correspondents
and
hear
the
war
news
and
and
were
there
and
there
among
them
to
my
astonishment
i
found
davidson
the
american
sculptor
the
last
time
i
saw
davidson
it
was
in
joseph
simpson
studio
the
one
under
mine
in
edwardes
square
he
was
making
a
bust
of
rabindranath
tagore
and
as
the
great
mystic
poet
disconcerted
him
by
continually
lapsing
into
meditation
under
this
process
thereby
emptying
his
beautiful
face
of
all
expression
whatever
i
had
been
called
down
from
my
studio
to
talk
to
him
so
as
to
lure
him
if
possible
from
meditation
and
keep
his
features
in
play
davidson
made
a
very
fine
bust
of
rabindranath
tagore
and
here
he
is
imperfectly
disguised
by
the
shortest
of
short
beards
drawing
caricatures
of
explaining
the
plan
of
campaign
to
the
belgian
general
staff
very
straight
and
tall
the
belgian
general
staff
looking
up
to
him
with
innocent
deferential
faces
earnestly
anxious
to
be
taught
i
am
not
more
surprised
at
seeing
davidson
here
than
he
is
at
seeing
me
in
the
world
that
makes
war
we
have
both
entirely
forgotten
the
world
where
people
make
busts
and
pictures
and
books
but
we
accept
each
presence
it
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
fantastic
dislocation
of
war
nothing
could
be
more
different
from
the
flandria
palace
hotel
our
military
hospital
than
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
it
is
packed
with
war
correspondents
and
belgian
officers
after
the
surgeons
and
the
red
cross
nurses
and
their
wounded
and
the
mysterious
officials
hanging
about
the
porch
and
the
hall
apparently
doing
nothing
after
the
english
ambulance
and
the
melancholy
inactivity
of
half
its
corps
this
place
seems
alive
with
a
rich
and
virile
life
it
is
full
of
live
exultant
fighters
and
of
men
who
have
their
business
not
with
the
wounded
and
the
dying
but
with
live
men
and
live
things
and
they
have
live
words
to
tell
about
them
at
least
so
it
seems
you
listen
with
all
your
ears
and
presently
termonde
and
alost
and
quatrecht
and
courtrai
cease
to
be
mere
names
for
you
and
become
realities
it
is
as
if
you
had
been
taken
from
your
prison
and
had
been
let
loose
into
the
world
again
they
are
saying
that
there
is
no
fighting
at
saint
nicolas
the
commandant
has
been
feeling
about
again
for
his
visionary
base
hospital
but
that
the
french
troops
are
at
courtrai
in
great
force
they
have
turned
their
left
wing
round
to
the
and
will
probably
sweep
towards
brussels
to
cut
off
the
german
advance
on
antwerp
the
siege
of
antwerp
will
then
be
raised
and
a
great
battle
will
be
fought
outside
brussels
probably
at
waterloo
waterloo
looks
at
you
as
much
as
to
say
that
is
what
he
has
had
up
his
sleeve
all
the
time
the
word
comes
from
him
as
casually
as
if
he
spoke
of
the
london
and
terminus
but
he
is
alive
to
the
power
of
its
evocation
to
the
unsurpassable
thrill
so
are
you
it
starts
the
current
in
that
wireless
system
of
vibrations
that
travel
unperishing
undiminished
from
the
dead
to
the
living
there
are
not
many
kilometres
between
ghent
and
waterloo
you
are
not
only
within
the
radius
of
the
psychic
shock
you
are
close
to
the
central
batteries
and
years
are
no
more
than
one
pulse
of
their
vibration
through
i
know
how
many
kilometres
and
years
it
has
tracked
you
down
and
found
you
in
your
one
moment
of
response
it
has
a
sudden
steadying
effect
your
brain
clears
the
things
that
loomed
so
large
the
flandria
and
the
english
field
ambulance
and
its
miseries
and
the
terrifying
recklessness
of
its
commandant
are
reduced
suddenly
to
invisibility
you
can
see
nothing
but
the
second
waterloo
you
forget
that
you
have
ever
been
a
prisoner
in
an
you
understand
the
mystic
fascination
of
the
road
under
your
windows
going
from
ghent
to
brussels
somewhere
towards
waterloo
you
are
reconciled
to
the
incomprehensible
lassitude
of
events
that
is
what
we
have
all
been
waiting
for
the
second
waterloo
and
we
have
only
waited
five
days
i
am
certainly
not
going
back
to
england
the
french
troops
are
being
massed
at
courtrai
suddenly
it
strikes
me
that
i
have
done
an
injustice
to
the
commandant
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
he
brought
me
out
here
against
my
will
but
did
he
he
said
it
would
interest
me
to
see
the
siege
of
antwerp
and
i
said
it
would
i
said
with
the
most
perfect
sincerity
that
die
rather
than
go
anywhere
near
the
siege
of
antwerp
or
of
any
other
place
and
now
the
from
namur
are
battering
the
forts
of
antwerp
and
down
there
the
armies
are
gathering
towards
the
second
waterloo
and
the
commandant
was
right
i
am
extremely
interested
i
would
die
rather
than
go
back
to
england
is
it
possible
that
he
knew
me
better
than
i
knew
myself
when
i
think
that
it
is
possible
i
feel
a
slight
revulsion
of
justice
towards
the
commandant
after
all
he
brought
me
here
we
may
disagree
about
the
present
state
of
alost
and
termonde
considered
as
for
english
girls
but
it
is
pretty
certain
that
without
him
we
would
none
of
us
have
got
here
where
indeed
should
we
have
been
and
how
should
we
have
got
our
motor
ambulances
but
for
his
intrepid
handling
of
providence
and
of
the
belgian
red
cross
and
the
belgian
legation
there
is
genius
in
a
man
who
can
go
out
without
one
car
or
the
least
little
nut
or
cog
of
a
to
his
name
and
impose
himself
upon
a
government
as
the
commandant
of
a
motor
field
ambulance
still
though
i
am
not
going
back
to
england
as
a
protest
i
going
to
leave
the
hospital
hotel
for
a
little
while
that
bright
idea
has
come
to
me
just
now
while
we
are
waiting
for
the
commandant
to
tear
himself
from
the
war
correspondents
and
come
away
i
shall
get
a
room
here
in
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
for
a
week
and
while
we
wait
for
waterloo
i
shall
write
some
articles
the
war
correspondents
will
tell
me
what
is
being
done
and
what
has
been
overdone
and
what
remains
to
do
i
shall
at
least
hear
things
if
i
ca
see
them
and
i
shall
cut
the
obsession
of
responsibility
it
be
worse
than
ever
if
there
really
is
going
to
be
a
second
waterloo
waterloo
with
ursula
dearmer
and
janet
in
the
thick
of
it
and
torrence
driving
the
colonel
there
are
moments
of
bitterness
and
distortion
when
i
see
the
commandant
as
a
curious
psychic
monster
bringing
up
his
women
with
him
to
the
because
of
some
uncanny
satisfaction
he
finds
in
their
presence
there
there
are
moods
only
less
perverted
when
i
see
him
pursuing
his
course
because
it
is
his
course
through
sheer
highland
celtic
obstinacy
lucid
flashes
when
he
appears
blinded
by
the
glamour
of
his
dream
and
innocently
regardless
of
actuality
is
it
uncanniness
is
it
obstinacy
is
it
dreamy
innocence
or
is
it
some
gorgeous
streak
of
feminism
is
it
the
new
chivalry
that
refuses
to
keep
women
back
even
from
the
the
new
romance
that
gives
them
their
share
of
divine
danger
or
since
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
suppose
that
any
person
acts
at
all
times
and
in
all
circumstances
on
one
ground
or
necessarily
on
any
grounds
is
it
a
little
bit
of
all
these
things
i
am
not
sure
that
feminism
or
at
any
rate
the
new
chivalry
does
presuppose
them
all
the
new
chivalry
sees
the
point
of
its
reporter
retirement
to
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
since
it
has
decided
that
journalism
is
my
work
and
journalism
can
not
flourish
at
the
flandria
so
we
interview
the
nice
fat
and
the
nice
fat
wife
and
between
them
they
find
a
room
for
me
a
back
room
on
the
fourth
floor
the
only
one
vacant
in
the
hotel
it
looks
out
on
the
walls
and
the
windows
of
the
enclosing
wings
the
space
shut
in
is
deep
and
narrow
as
a
well
the
view
from
that
room
is
more
like
a
prison
than
any
view
from
the
flandria
but
i
take
it
i
am
not
deceived
by
appearances
and
i
recognize
that
the
peace
of
god
is
there
it
is
a
relief
to
think
that
poor
max
will
have
one
less
to
work
for
at
the
flandria
we
find
that
the
military
power
has
put
its
foot
down
the
general
he
can
not
have
a
spark
of
the
new
chivalry
in
his
brutal
breast
has
ordered
torrence
off
her
chauffeur
job
you
see
the
grizzled
colonel
as
the
image
of
protest
and
desolation
helpless
in
the
hands
of
the
implacable
power
you
are
sorry
for
torrence
she
has
seen
practically
no
service
with
the
ambulance
as
yet
but
she
at
any
rate
has
had
her
fling
no
power
can
take
from
her
the
memory
of
those
two
days
still
something
is
going
to
be
done
and
this
time
even
the
miserable
reporter
is
to
have
a
look
in
the
commandant
has
another
scheme
for
a
temporary
hospital
or
a
or
something
and
he
is
going
with
car
to
courtrai
to
reconnoitre
for
a
position
and
incidentally
to
see
the
french
troops
a
opportunity
for
the
reporter
and
janet
mcneil
is
going
too
we
are
to
get
up
at
six
in
the
morning
and
start
before
seven
october
we
get
up
at
six
we
hang
about
till
or
nine
a
fine
rain
begins
to
fall
an
ominous
rain
car
and
car
are
drawn
up
at
the
far
end
of
the
hospital
yard
the
rain
falls
ominously
over
the
trodden
clay
of
the
yard
there
is
an
ominous
look
of
preparation
about
the
cars
there
is
also
an
ominous
light
in
the
blue
eyes
of
the
chauffeur
tom
the
chauffeur
tom
appears
as
one
inspired
by
hatred
of
the
whole
human
race
you
would
say
that
he
was
also
hostile
to
the
entire
female
sex
for
woman
in
her
right
place
he
may
he
probably
does
feel
tenderness
and
reverence
woman
in
a
field
ambulance
he
despises
and
abhors
i
really
think
it
was
the
sight
of
us
that
accounted
for
his
depression
at
ostend
i
have
gathered
from
torrence
that
the
chauffeur
tom
has
none
of
the
new
chivalry
about
him
he
is
the
mean
and
brutal
male
the
crass
obstructionist
who
grudges
women
their
laurels
in
the
equal
field
i
know
the
dreadful
blasphemous
and
abominable
things
that
tom
is
probably
thinking
about
me
as
i
climb
on
to
his
car
he
is
visibly
disgusted
with
his
orders
that
he
a
red
cross
field
ambulance
chauffeur
should
be
told
to
drive
four
or
is
it
all
five
women
to
look
at
the
massing
of
the
french
troops
at
courtrai
he
is
not
deceived
by
the
specious
pretext
of
the
temporary
hospital
hospitals
be
blowed
it
a
bloomin
with
about
as
much
red
cross
in
it
as
there
is
in
my
hat
he
is
glad
that
it
is
raining
yes
i
know
what
tom
is
thinking
and
all
the
time
i
have
a
sneaking
sympathy
with
tom
i
want
to
go
to
courtrai
more
than
i
ever
wanted
anything
in
my
life
but
i
see
the
expedition
plainly
from
tom
point
of
view
a
field
ambulance
is
a
field
ambulance
and
not
a
motor
touring
car
and
tom
is
justified
we
have
hardly
got
upon
his
car
than
we
were
told
to
get
off
it
we
are
not
going
to
courtrai
we
are
not
going
anywhere
from
somewhere
in
those
mysterious
regions
where
it
abides
the
military
power
has
come
down
even
as
i
get
off
the
car
and
return
to
the
in
melancholy
retreat
over
the
clay
of
the
yard
through
the
rain
i
acknowledge
the
essential
righteousness
of
the
point
of
view
and
to
the
everlasting
honour
of
the
old
chivalry
it
should
be
stated
that
the
chauffeur
tom
repressed
all
open
and
visible
expression
of
his
joy
the
morning
passes
as
the
other
mornings
passed
in
unspeakable
inactivity
except
that
i
make
up
the
accounts
and
hand
them
over
to
grierson
it
seems
incredible
but
i
have
balanced
them
to
the
last
franc
i
pack
am
surprised
in
packing
by
max
and
jean
they
both
want
to
know
the
reason
why
this
is
the
terrible
part
of
the
business
leaving
max
and
jean
i
try
to
explain
prosper
panne
who
writes
for
the
paris
papers
understands
me
he
can
see
that
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
may
be
a
better
base
for
an
attack
upon
the
london
papers
but
max
does
not
understand
he
perceives
that
i
have
a
scruple
about
occupying
my
room
and
he
takes
me
into
room
to
show
me
how
nice
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
mine
the
implication
being
that
if
the
hospital
can
afford
to
lodge
one
of
its
orderlies
so
well
it
can
perfectly
well
afford
to
lodge
me
this
is
one
of
the
prettiest
things
that
max
has
done
yet
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
see
him
standing
in
his
room
and
showing
me
how
nice
it
is
still
you
can
always
appeal
from
max
to
prosper
panne
he
understands
these
journalistic
tempers
and
caprices
he
knows
on
how
thin
a
thread
an
article
can
hang
we
have
a
brief
discussion
on
the
comparative
difficulties
of
the
and
the
and
he
promises
me
to
cherish
and
protect
the
hat
i
must
leave
behind
me
as
if
it
were
his
bride
but
jean
jean
does
not
understand
at
all
he
thinks
that
i
am
not
satisfied
with
the
service
of
our
incomparable
mess
that
i
prefer
the
of
the
poste
and
the
manners
of
its
waiters
he
has
no
other
thought
but
this
and
it
is
abominable
it
is
the
worst
of
all
the
explanation
thickens
i
struggle
gloriously
with
the
french
language
one
moment
it
has
me
by
the
throat
and
i
am
strangled
the
next
i
writhe
forth
triumphant
strange
gestures
are
given
to
me
i
plunge
into
the
darkest
pits
of
memory
for
the
words
that
have
escaped
me
i
find
them
or
others
just
as
good
it
is
really
quite
easy
to
say
that
i
am
coming
back
again
in
a
week
interview
with
madame
and
the
president
interview
with
the
commandant
final
assault
on
the
defences
of
the
new
chivalry
the
commandant
mind
is
an
impregnable
fortress
and
by
way
of
afterthought
i
inquire
whether
in
the
event
of
a
sudden
scoot
before
the
germans
a
reporter
quartered
at
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
will
be
cut
off
from
the
base
of
communications
and
left
to
his
or
her
ingenuity
in
flight
the
commandant
vague
and
imperturbable
replies
that
in
all
probability
it
will
be
so
and
i
if
possible
more
imperturbable
than
he
observe
that
the
war
correspondents
will
make
quite
a
nice
in
a
little
open
carriage
the
taxis
have
long
ago
all
gone
to
the
war
in
an
absurd
little
open
carriage
exactly
like
a
cheltenham
rat
i
depart
like
a
lady
of
cheltenham
for
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
the
appearance
and
the
odour
of
this
little
carriage
give
you
an
odd
sense
of
security
and
peace
the
germans
may
be
advancing
on
ghent
at
this
moment
but
for
all
the
taste
of
war
there
is
in
it
you
might
be
that
lady
going
from
one
hotel
to
the
other
down
the
cheltenham
promenade
the
further
you
go
from
the
military
hospital
and
the
railway
station
the
more
it
is
so
the
war
does
not
seem
yet
to
have
shaken
the
essential
peace
of
the
city
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
is
in
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
where
the
cathedrals
are
instead
of
the
long
black
railway
lines
and
the
façade
of
the
station
and
post
office
instead
of
the
wooded
fields
beyond
and
the
white
street
that
leads
to
the
south
and
east
instead
of
the
great
square
with
its
mustering
troops
and
swarms
of
refugees
you
have
the
quiet
place
shut
in
by
trees
and
all
round
it
are
the
hotels
and
cafés
where
the
officers
and
the
war
correspondents
come
and
go
through
all
that
coming
and
going
you
get
the
sense
of
the
old
foreign
town
that
was
dreaming
yesterday
people
are
sitting
outside
the
restaurants
all
round
the
place
drinking
coffee
and
liqueurs
as
if
nothing
had
happened
as
if
antwerp
were
in
another
country
and
as
if
it
were
still
yesterday
mosquitoes
come
up
from
the
drowsy
canal
water
and
swarm
into
the
hotels
and
bite
you
i
found
any
number
of
mosquitoes
clinging
drowsily
to
my
bedroom
walls
but
there
are
very
few
women
among
those
crowds
outside
the
restaurants
there
are
not
many
women
except
refugees
in
the
streets
and
fewer
still
in
the
shops
i
have
blundered
across
a
little
café
with
an
affectionately
smiling
and
reassuringly
fat
proprietress
where
they
give
you
and
china
tea
which
as
it
were
in
sheer
affection
they
call
english
it
is
not
as
happy
a
find
as
you
might
think
it
is
not
in
the
circumstances
happy
at
all
in
fact
if
you
have
never
known
what
melancholy
is
and
would
like
to
know
it
i
can
recommend
two
courses
go
down
the
grand
canal
in
venice
in
the
grey
spring
of
the
year
in
a
gondola
all
by
yourself
or
get
mixed
up
with
a
field
ambulance
which
is
not
only
doing
noble
work
but
running
thrilling
risks
in
neither
of
which
you
have
a
share
or
the
ghost
of
a
chance
of
a
share
cut
yourself
off
from
your
comrades
if
it
is
only
for
a
week
and
go
into
a
belgian
café
in
and
try
to
eat
and
drink
english
tea
all
by
yourself
this
is
the
more
successful
course
you
may
see
hope
beyond
the
gondola
and
the
grand
canal
but
you
will
see
no
hope
beyond
the
and
the
english
tea
i
walk
about
again
till
it
is
time
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
so
far
my
emancipation
has
not
been
agreeable
hôtel
de
la
i
dined
in
the
crowded
restaurant
avoiding
the
war
correspondents
choosing
a
table
where
i
hoped
i
might
be
unobserved
somewhere
through
a
glass
screen
i
caught
a
sight
of
head
i
was
careful
to
avoid
the
glass
screen
and
head
he
shall
not
say
if
i
can
possibly
help
it
that
i
am
an
infernal
nuisance
for
i
know
i
have
any
business
to
be
here
and
if
belgium
had
a
kitchener
i
should
be
here
however
you
look
at
me
i
am
here
on
false
pretences
in
the
eyes
of
i
would
have
no
more
right
to
be
a
war
correspondent
if
i
were
one
than
i
have
to
be
on
a
field
ambulance
it
is
with
the
game
of
war
as
it
was
with
the
game
of
football
i
used
to
play
with
my
big
brothers
in
the
garden
the
women
may
play
it
if
they
fit
enough
up
to
a
certain
point
very
much
as
i
played
football
in
the
garden
the
big
brothers
let
their
little
sister
kick
off
they
let
her
run
away
with
the
ball
they
stood
back
and
let
her
make
goal
after
goal
but
when
it
came
to
the
scrimmage
they
took
hold
of
her
and
gently
but
firmly
moved
her
to
one
side
if
she
persisted
she
became
an
infernal
nuisance
and
if
those
big
brothers
over
there
only
knew
what
i
was
after
they
would
make
arrangements
for
my
immediate
removal
from
the
seat
of
war
the
commandant
has
turned
up
with
ursula
dearmer
he
is
drawn
to
these
war
correspondents
who
appear
to
know
more
than
he
does
on
the
other
hand
an
ambulance
that
can
get
into
the
has
an
irresistible
attraction
for
a
war
correspondent
it
may
at
any
moment
constitute
his
only
means
of
getting
there
himself
one
of
our
cars
has
been
sent
out
to
antwerp
with
dispatches
and
surgical
appliances
the
sight
of
the
commandant
reminds
me
that
i
have
got
all
the
funds
of
the
ambulance
upstairs
in
my
in
that
leather
and
if
the
ambulance
does
fly
from
ghent
without
me
and
without
that
belt
it
will
find
itself
in
considerable
embarrassment
before
it
has
retreated
very
far
it
is
quite
certain
that
i
shall
have
to
take
my
chance
i
have
asked
the
commandant
again
either
this
evening
or
earlier
so
that
there
may
be
no
possible
doubt
about
it
if
we
do
have
to
scoot
from
ghent
in
a
hurry
i
shall
have
nothing
but
my
wits
to
trust
to
and
he
says
true
for
you
and
he
looks
as
if
he
meant
it
these
remarkable
words
have
a
remarkable
effect
on
the
new
war
correspondent
it
is
as
if
the
coolness
and
the
courage
and
the
strength
of
a
hundred
war
correspondents
and
of
fifty
red
cross
ambulances
had
been
suddenly
discharged
into
my
soul
this
absurd
accession
of
power
and
valour
is
accompanied
by
a
sudden
immense
lucidity
it
is
as
if
my
soul
had
never
really
belonged
to
me
until
now
as
if
it
had
been
either
drugged
or
drunk
and
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
sober
until
now
the
sensation
is
distinctly
agreeable
and
on
the
top
of
it
all
there
is
a
peace
which
i
distinctly
recognize
as
the
peace
of
god
so
while
the
commandant
talks
to
the
war
correspondents
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
go
upstairs
and
unlock
my
and
take
from
it
the
leather
with
the
ambulance
funds
in
it
and
i
bring
it
to
the
commandant
and
lay
it
before
him
and
compel
him
to
put
it
on
as
i
do
this
i
feel
considerable
compunction
as
if
i
were
launching
a
child
in
a
on
the
perilous
ocean
of
finance
i
remind
him
that
fifteen
pounds
of
the
money
in
the
belt
is
his
he
would
be
as
likely
as
not
to
forget
it
as
for
the
accounts
they
are
so
clear
that
a
child
could
understand
them
i
notice
with
a
diabolical
satisfaction
which
persists
through
the
peace
by
no
means
as
incongruously
as
you
might
imagine
i
notice
particularly
that
the
commandant
does
like
this
part
of
it
a
bit
there
is
not
anybody
in
the
corps
who
wants
to
be
responsible
for
its
funds
or
enjoys
wearing
that
belt
but
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
ambulance
can
bear
to
be
separated
from
its
in
the
flight
from
ghent
it
can
not
possibly
bear
to
be
separated
from
its
funds
i
am
alone
with
the
commandant
while
this
happens
standing
by
one
of
the
in
the
lounge
ursula
dearmer
she
grows
more
mature
every
day
and
the
war
correspondents
and
a
few
generals
have
melted
somewhere
into
the
background
the
long
lithe
pigskin
belt
lies
between
us
on
the
table
between
my
friend
and
me
like
a
pale
snake
it
exerts
some
malign
and
poisonous
influence
it
makes
me
say
things
things
that
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
to
say
and
it
is
all
about
the
shells
at
alost
he
is
astonished
and
i
do
not
care
i
am
sustained
exalted
by
that
sense
of
righteousness
you
feel
when
you
are
insanely
pounding
somebody
who
thinks
that
in
perfect
sanity
and
integrity
he
has
pounded
you
asked
me
to
breakfast
he
has
told
me
more
about
the
corps
in
five
minutes
than
the
corps
has
been
able
to
tell
me
in
as
many
days
he
has
seen
it
at
alost
and
termonde
you
gather
that
he
has
seen
other
heroic
enterprises
also
and
that
he
would
perjure
himself
if
he
swore
that
they
were
indispensable
every
correspondent
is
besieged
by
the
leaders
of
heroic
enterprises
and
i
imagine
that
has
been
had
before
now
by
amateurs
of
the
red
cross
and
his
heart
must
have
sunk
when
he
heard
of
an
english
field
ambulance
in
ghent
and
he
owns
to
positive
terror
when
he
saw
it
with
its
girls
in
breeches
its
commandant
in
norfolk
jacket
grey
knickerbockers
stockings
and
its
chaplain
in
khaki
and
its
surgeon
a
mark
for
bullets
in
his
belgian
officer
cap
i
suggest
that
this
absence
of
uniform
only
proves
our
passionate
eagerness
to
be
off
and
get
to
work
but
it
is
right
our
ambulance
is
the
real
thing
and
is
going
to
be
an
angel
and
help
it
all
he
can
he
will
write
about
it
in
the
london
and
the
when
he
hears
that
i
came
out
here
to
write
about
the
war
and
make
a
little
money
for
the
field
ambulance
and
that
i
have
seen
anything
of
the
war
and
that
my
invasion
of
his
hotel
is
simply
a
last
despairing
effort
to
at
least
hear
something
he
is
more
angelic
than
ever
he
causes
a
whole
cinema
of
to
pass
before
my
eyes
when
i
ask
if
there
is
anything
left
for
me
to
do
he
evokes
a
long
procession
of
articles
pure
virgin
copy
on
which
no
journalist
has
ever
laid
his
hands
and
assures
me
that
it
is
mine
that
the
things
that
have
been
done
are
nothing
to
the
things
that
are
left
to
do
i
tell
him
that
i
have
no
business
on
his
pitch
and
that
i
am
horribly
afraid
of
getting
in
the
regular
correspondents
way
and
spoiling
their
game
as
i
am
likely
to
play
it
there
is
any
pitch
of
course
i
suppose
there
is
the
scoop
but
that
another
matter
it
is
the
war
crown
of
cunning
and
of
valour
and
nobody
can
take
from
him
that
crown
but
in
the
psychology
of
the
thing
every
correspondent
is
his
own
pitch
he
has
told
me
very
nearly
all
the
things
i
want
to
know
among
them
what
the
belgian
general
said
to
the
commandant
when
he
saw
ursula
dearmer
at
alost
what
the
devil
is
the
lady
doing
there
i
gather
that
shares
the
general
wonder
and
my
own
anxiety
i
am
not
far
wrong
in
regarding
alost
and
termonde
as
no
fit
place
for
ursula
dearmer
or
any
other
woman
answered
the
commandant
letters
for
him
wrote
to
ezra
pound
wrote
out
the
report
for
the
last
three
days
ambulance
work
and
sent
it
to
the
british
red
cross
also
a
letter
to
rogers
about
a
light
the
british
red
cross
has
written
that
it
can
not
spare
any
more
motor
ambulances
but
it
may
possibly
send
out
a
small
car
the
commandant
has
cabled
to
gould
of
gould
exeter
accepting
his
offer
of
his
own
car
and
services
went
down
to
the
flandria
for
news
of
the
ambulance
the
car
that
was
sent
out
yesterday
evening
got
through
all
right
to
antwerp
and
returned
safely
it
has
brought
very
bad
news
two
of
the
outer
forts
are
said
to
have
fallen
the
position
is
critical
and
grave
anxiety
is
felt
for
the
safety
of
the
english
in
antwerp
clair
stobart
has
asked
us
for
one
of
our
ambulances
but
even
if
we
could
spare
it
we
can
not
give
it
up
without
an
order
from
the
military
authority
at
ghent
we
hear
that
one
of
stobart
women
is
to
leave
antwerp
and
work
at
our
hospital
she
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
and
the
poor
boy
is
somewhat
concerned
for
her
safety
i
very
glad
i
have
left
the
flandria
for
she
can
have
my
room
i
wish
they
would
make
miss
come
away
too
yes
miss
that
clever
novelist
who
passes
for
a
woman
of
the
world
because
she
uses
mundane
appearances
to
hide
herself
from
the
world
importunity
miss
is
here
the
war
caught
her
some
people
were
surprised
i
was
walked
through
the
town
again
old
quarter
walked
and
walked
and
walked
thinking
about
antwerp
all
the
time
through
streets
of
and
houses
with
very
fragile
balconies
saw
the
two
cathedrals
and
the
town
hall
refugees
swarming
round
it
and
the
rab
i
ca
remember
its
name
see
baedeker
with
its
turrets
and
its
moat
any
amount
of
time
to
see
cathedrals
in
and
no
torrence
to
protest
i
wonder
how
much
of
all
this
will
be
left
by
next
month
or
even
by
next
week
two
of
the
antwerp
forts
have
fallen
they
say
the
occupation
of
ghent
will
be
peaceful
while
of
antwerp
i
suppose
they
would
say
triste
pas
they
say
the
germans
will
just
march
into
ghent
and
march
out
again
commandeering
a
few
things
here
and
there
but
nobody
knows
and
by
the
stolid
faces
of
these
civilians
you
might
imagine
that
nobody
cares
certainly
none
of
them
think
that
the
fate
of
antwerp
can
be
the
fate
of
ghent
and
the
faces
of
the
soldiers
of
the
men
who
know
they
are
the
faces
of
important
people
cheerful
people
pleasantly
preoccupied
with
the
business
in
hand
only
here
and
there
a
grave
face
a
fixed
drawn
face
a
face
twisted
with
the
irritation
of
the
strain
why
the
very
refugees
have
the
look
of
a
rather
tired
wandering
about
seeing
ghent
seeing
the
cathedral
only
they
are
looking
at
the
cathedral
they
are
looking
straight
ahead
across
the
up
the
street
they
do
not
see
or
hear
the
trams
swinging
down
on
them
or
the
tearing
snorting
motors
they
stroll
abstractedly
into
the
line
of
the
motors
and
stand
there
they
start
and
scatter
with
a
sudden
recrudescence
of
the
terror
that
has
driven
them
here
from
their
villages
in
the
fields
it
seems
incredible
that
i
should
be
free
to
walk
about
like
this
it
is
as
if
i
had
cut
the
rope
that
tied
me
to
a
soaring
and
found
myself
with
firm
feet
safe
on
the
solid
earth
any
bit
of
earth
even
surrounded
by
germans
seems
safe
compared
with
the
asphyxiation
of
that
ascent
and
when
the
was
going
up
it
was
as
if
i
had
lain
stifling
under
a
soft
for
more
than
a
year
now
i
waked
up
suddenly
and
flung
the
off
with
a
vigorous
kick
sunday
i
have
no
clear
recollection
of
sunday
morning
because
in
the
afternoon
we
went
to
antwerp
and
antwerp
has
blotted
out
everything
that
went
near
before
it
the
ambulance
has
been
ordered
to
take
two
belgian
professors
or
else
they
are
doctors
into
antwerp
there
is
any
question
this
time
of
carrying
wounded
it
seems
incredible
but
i
am
going
too
i
shall
see
the
siege
of
antwerp
and
hear
the
guns
that
were
brought
up
from
namur
somewhere
on
the
horizon
a
vision
heavenly
but
impalpable
aerial
indistinct
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
i
am
glad
i
am
going
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
there
is
no
excitement
about
it
it
seems
an
entirely
fit
and
natural
thing
that
the
vision
should
materialize
that
i
should
see
the
shells
battering
the
forts
of
antwerp
and
hear
the
big
from
namur
for
all
its
incredibility
the
adventure
lacks
every
element
of
surprise
it
is
simply
what
i
came
out
for
for
here
in
belgium
the
really
incredible
things
are
the
things
that
existed
and
happened
before
the
war
they
existed
and
happened
a
hundred
years
ago
and
the
memory
of
them
is
indistinct
the
feeling
of
them
is
gone
you
have
ceased
to
have
any
personal
interest
in
them
if
they
happened
at
all
they
happened
to
somebody
else
what
is
happening
now
has
been
happening
always
all
your
past
is
soaking
in
the
vivid
dye
of
these
days
and
what
you
are
now
you
have
been
always
i
have
been
a
war
correspondent
all
my
life
with
battles
the
commandant
orders
me
into
the
front
seat
beside
the
chauffeur
tom
so
that
i
may
see
things
even
tom
face
can
not
shake
me
in
my
conviction
that
i
am
merely
setting
out
once
more
on
my
usual
legitimate
daily
job
it
is
all
so
natural
that
you
do
not
wonder
in
the
least
at
this
really
very
singular
extension
of
your
personality
you
are
not
aware
of
your
personality
at
all
if
you
could
be
you
would
see
it
undergoing
shrinkage
it
is
anyhow
one
of
the
things
that
ceased
to
matter
a
hundred
years
ago
if
you
could
examine
its
contents
at
this
moment
you
would
find
nothing
there
but
that
shining
vision
of
danger
the
siege
of
antwerp
indistinct
impalpable
aerial
presently
the
vision
itself
shrinks
and
disappears
on
the
horizon
the
car
has
shot
beyond
the
streets
into
the
open
road
the
great
paved
highway
to
antwerp
and
i
am
absorbed
in
other
matters
in
car
and
in
the
chauffeur
tom
who
is
letting
her
rip
more
and
more
into
her
top
speed
with
every
mile
in
c
the
belgian
red
cross
guide
beside
me
on
my
left
and
in
the
belgian
soldier
sitting
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
the
soldier
is
confiding
some
fearful
secret
to
c
about
somebody
called
achille
c
bends
very
low
to
catch
the
name
as
if
he
were
trying
to
intercept
and
conceal
it
and
when
he
caught
it
he
assumes
an
air
of
superb
mystery
and
gravity
and
importance
with
one
gesture
he
buries
the
name
of
achille
in
his
breast
under
his
uniform
you
know
that
he
would
die
rather
than
betray
the
secret
of
achille
you
decide
that
achille
is
the
heroic
bearer
of
dispatches
and
that
we
have
secret
orders
to
pick
him
up
somewhere
and
convey
him
in
safety
to
antwerp
you
do
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
this
pantomime
until
the
third
sentry
has
approached
us
and
c
has
stopped
for
the
third
time
to
whisper
behind
the
cover
of
his
hand
and
the
third
sentry
is
instantly
appeased
concerning
sentries
you
learn
that
the
belgian
kind
is
amiable
but
that
the
french
sentry
is
a
terrible
fellow
who
will
think
nothing
of
shooting
you
if
your
car
does
stop
dead
the
instant
he
levels
his
rifle
except
for
sentries
and
straggling
troops
and
the
long
trains
of
refugees
the
country
is
as
peaceful
between
ghent
and
saint
nicolas
as
it
was
last
week
between
ostend
and
ghent
it
is
the
same
adorable
flemish
country
the
same
flat
fields
the
same
paved
causeway
and
the
same
tall
slender
avenues
of
trees
but
if
anything
could
make
the
desolation
of
belgium
more
desolate
it
is
this
intolerable
beauty
of
slender
trees
and
infinite
flat
land
the
beauty
of
a
country
formed
for
the
very
expression
of
peace
in
the
vivid
gold
and
green
of
its
autumn
it
has
become
a
stage
dressed
with
ironic
splendour
for
the
spectacle
of
a
people
in
flight
half
the
population
of
antwerp
and
the
country
round
it
is
pouring
into
ghent
first
the
automobiles
belgian
officers
in
uniform
packed
tight
between
women
and
children
and
their
bundles
convoying
the
train
then
the
carriages
secured
by
the
they
are
very
few
then
men
and
boys
on
bicycles
then
the
carts
and
with
the
coming
on
of
the
carts
the
spectacle
grows
incredible
fantastic
you
see
a
thing
advancing
like
a
house
on
wheels
it
is
a
tall
the
tallest
wagon
you
have
ever
seen
in
your
life
piled
with
household
furniture
and
mattresses
on
the
top
of
the
furniture
and
on
top
of
the
mattresses
on
the
roof
as
it
were
a
family
of
women
and
children
and
young
girls
some
of
them
seem
conscious
of
the
stupendous
absurdity
of
this
appearance
they
smile
at
you
or
laugh
as
the
structure
goes
towering
and
toppling
by
next
low
on
the
ground
enormous
and
grotesque
bundles
endowed
with
movement
and
with
legs
only
when
you
come
up
to
them
do
you
see
that
they
are
borne
on
the
bowed
backs
of
men
and
women
and
children
the
children
when
there
are
no
bundles
to
be
borne
these
carry
a
bird
in
a
cage
or
a
dog
a
dog
that
sits
in
their
arms
like
a
baby
and
is
pressed
tight
to
their
breasts
here
and
there
men
and
women
driving
their
cattle
before
them
driving
them
gently
without
haste
with
a
great
dignity
and
patience
these
for
all
the
panic
and
ruin
in
their
bearing
might
be
pilgrims
or
suppliants
or
the
servants
of
some
religious
rite
bringing
the
votive
offerings
and
the
sacrificial
beasts
the
infinite
land
and
the
avenues
of
slender
trees
persuade
you
that
it
is
so
and
wherever
the
ambulance
cars
go
they
meet
endless
processions
of
refugees
endless
for
the
straight
flat
flemish
roads
are
endless
and
as
far
as
your
eye
can
see
the
stream
of
people
is
unbroken
endless
because
the
misery
of
belgium
is
endless
the
mind
can
not
grasp
it
or
take
it
in
you
can
not
meet
it
with
grief
hardly
with
conscious
pity
you
have
no
tears
for
it
it
is
a
sorrow
that
transcends
everything
you
have
known
of
sorrow
these
people
have
been
left
only
their
eyes
to
weep
with
but
they
do
not
weep
any
more
than
you
do
they
have
no
tears
for
themselves
or
for
each
other
this
is
the
terrible
thing
this
and
the
manner
of
their
flight
it
is
not
flight
it
is
the
vast
unhasting
and
unending
movement
of
a
people
crushed
down
by
grief
and
weariness
pushed
on
by
its
own
weight
by
the
ceaseless
impact
of
its
ruin
this
stream
is
the
main
stream
from
antwerp
swollen
by
its
tributaries
it
does
seem
to
matter
where
it
comes
from
its
strength
and
volume
always
seem
the
same
after
the
siege
of
antwerp
it
will
thicken
and
flow
from
some
other
direction
that
is
all
and
all
the
streams
seem
to
flow
into
ghent
and
to
meet
in
the
palais
des
fêtes
i
forget
whether
it
was
near
lokeren
or
saint
nicolas
that
we
saw
the
first
sign
of
fighting
in
houses
levelled
to
the
ground
to
make
way
for
the
artillery
fire
levelled
and
raked
into
neat
plots
without
the
semblance
of
a
site
after
the
refugees
the
troops
village
streets
crowded
with
military
automobiles
and
trains
of
baggage
wagons
and
regiments
of
infantry
little
villas
with
desolate
surprised
and
innocent
faces
standing
back
in
their
gardens
soldiers
sitting
in
their
porches
and
verandahs
soldiers
faces
looking
out
of
their
windows
soldiers
are
quartered
in
every
room
and
the
grass
grows
high
in
their
gardens
soldiers
run
down
the
garden
paths
to
look
at
our
ambulance
as
it
goes
by
there
is
excitement
in
the
village
streets
at
saint
nicolas
we
overtake
wilson
and
davidson
walking
into
antwerp
they
tell
us
the
news
the
british
troops
have
come
at
last
they
have
been
through
before
us
on
their
way
to
antwerp
wilson
and
davidson
have
seen
the
british
troops
they
have
talked
to
them
davidson
can
not
conceal
his
glee
at
getting
in
before
the
war
correspondents
pure
luck
has
given
into
his
hands
great
journalistic
scoop
of
the
war
in
belgium
and
he
is
not
a
journalist
he
is
a
sculptor
out
for
the
busts
of
warriors
and
for
actuality
in
those
tragic
and
splendid
figures
that
are
grouped
round
memorial
columns
for
the
living
attitude
and
gesture
we
take
up
davidson
and
wilson
and
leave
one
of
our
professors
if
he
is
a
professor
at
saint
nicolas
for
the
poor
man
has
come
without
his
passport
he
will
have
to
hang
about
at
saint
nicolas
doing
nothing
until
such
time
as
it
pleases
heaven
to
send
us
back
from
antwerp
he
resigns
himself
and
we
abandon
him
a
piteous
figure
wrapped
in
a
brown
shawl
after
saint
nicolas
more
troops
a
few
batteries
of
artillery
some
infantry
long
long
regiments
of
belgian
cavalry
coming
to
the
defence
of
the
country
outside
antwerp
cavalry
halting
at
a
fork
of
the
road
by
a
little
a
road
that
is
rather
like
the
road
just
outside
wareham
as
you
go
towards
poole
more
troops
and
after
the
troops
an
interminable
procession
of
labourers
trudging
on
foot
at
a
distance
you
take
them
for
refugees
until
you
see
that
they
are
carrying
poles
and
spades
presently
the
road
cuts
through
the
circle
of
stakes
and
barbed
wire
entanglements
set
for
the
german
cavalry
and
somewhere
on
our
left
whether
before
or
after
saint
nicolas
i
can
not
remember
across
a
field
the
rail
embankment
ran
parallel
with
our
field
and
we
saw
the
long
ambulance
train
flying
the
red
cross
and
loaded
with
wounded
on
its
way
from
antwerp
to
ghent
at
this
point
the
line
is
exposed
conspicuously
and
we
must
have
been
well
within
range
of
the
german
fire
for
the
next
ambulance
train
but
we
did
know
about
the
next
ambulance
train
till
afterwards
after
the
circle
of
the
stakes
and
wire
entanglements
you
begin
to
think
of
the
bombardment
you
strain
your
ears
for
the
sound
of
the
from
namur
somewhere
ahead
of
us
on
the
horizon
there
is
antwerp
towers
and
tall
chimneys
in
a
very
grey
distance
every
minute
you
look
for
the
flight
of
the
shells
across
the
grey
and
the
fall
of
a
tower
or
a
chimney
but
the
grey
is
utterly
peaceful
and
the
towers
and
the
tall
chimneys
remain
and
at
last
you
turn
in
a
righteous
indignation
and
say
where
is
the
bombardment
the
bombardment
is
at
the
outer
forts
and
where
are
the
forts
then
you
see
no
forts
the
outer
forts
oh
the
outer
forts
are
thirty
kilometres
away
no
not
there
to
your
right
and
you
who
thought
you
would
have
died
rather
than
see
the
siege
of
antwerp
are
dumb
with
disgust
your
heart
swells
with
a
holy
and
incorruptible
resentment
of
the
sheer
levity
of
the
commandant
a
pretty
thing
to
bring
a
war
correspondent
out
to
see
a
bombardment
when
there
is
any
bombardment
or
when
all
there
ever
was
is
a
hundred
well
then
kilometres
away
it
was
twilight
as
we
came
into
antwerp
we
approached
it
by
the
west
by
the
way
of
the
sea
by
the
great
bridge
of
boats
over
the
scheldt
the
sea
and
the
dykes
are
the
defence
of
antwerp
on
this
side
whole
regiments
of
troops
are
crossing
the
bridge
of
boats
our
car
crawls
by
inches
at
a
time
it
is
jammed
tight
among
some
baggage
wagons
it
disentangles
itself
with
difficulty
from
the
baggage
wagons
and
is
wedged
tighter
still
among
the
troops
but
the
troops
are
moving
though
by
inches
at
a
time
we
get
our
front
wheels
on
to
the
bridge
packed
in
among
the
troops
but
moving
steadily
as
they
move
we
cross
the
scheldt
on
our
right
the
sharp
bows
and
on
our
left
the
blunt
sterns
of
the
boats
boat
after
boat
pressed
close
gunwale
to
gunwale
our
roadway
goes
across
their
breasts
their
breasts
are
taut
as
the
breasts
of
gymnasts
under
the
tramping
of
the
regiments
they
vibrate
like
the
breasts
of
living
things
as
they
bear
us
up
no
heaving
of
any
beautiful
and
beloved
ship
no
crossing
of
any
sea
no
sight
of
any
city
that
has
the
sea
at
her
feet
not
new
york
city
nor
venice
no
coming
into
any
foreign
land
ever
thrilled
me
as
that
coming
into
antwerp
with
the
belgian
army
over
that
bridge
of
boats
at
twilight
from
the
river
with
its
lamps
lit
and
all
its
waters
shining
antwerp
looked
beautiful
as
venice
and
as
safe
and
still
for
the
dykes
are
her
defences
on
this
side
but
for
the
trudging
regiments
you
would
not
have
guessed
that
on
the
land
side
the
outer
ramparts
were
being
shelled
incessantly
it
was
a
struggle
up
the
slope
from
the
river
bank
to
the
quay
a
struggle
in
which
we
engaged
with
commissariat
and
ammunition
wagons
and
troops
and
refugees
in
carts
all
trying
to
get
away
from
the
city
over
the
bridge
of
boats
the
ascent
was
so
steep
and
slippery
that
you
felt
as
though
at
any
moment
the
car
might
hurl
itself
down
backwards
on
the
top
of
the
processions
struggling
behind
it
at
last
we
landed
i
have
no
vivid
recollection
of
our
passage
through
the
town
except
that
i
know
we
actually
were
in
antwerp
i
could
not
say
whether
i
really
saw
certain
winding
streets
and
old
houses
with
steep
gables
or
whether
i
dreamed
them
there
was
one
great
street
of
white
houses
and
gilded
signs
that
stood
shimmering
somewhere
in
the
twilight
but
i
can
not
tell
you
what
street
it
was
and
there
were
some
modern
boulevards
and
the
whole
place
was
very
silent
it
had
the
silence
and
half
darkness
of
dreams
and
the
beauty
and
magic
and
sinister
sadness
of
dreams
and
in
that
silence
and
sadness
our
car
with
its
backings
and
turnings
and
its
snorts
and
our
own
voices
as
we
asked
our
way
for
we
were
more
or
less
lost
in
antwerp
seemed
to
be
making
an
appalling
and
inappropriate
and
impious
noise
antwerp
seems
to
me
to
have
been
all
hospitals
though
i
only
saw
two
or
perhaps
three
one
was
in
an
ordinary
house
in
a
street
and
i
think
this
must
have
been
the
british
field
hospital
for
winterbottom
was
there
and
of
all
the
women
i
met
thus
casually
at
the
front
she
was
by
a
long
way
the
most
attractive
we
went
into
one
or
two
of
the
wards
in
others
where
the
cases
were
very
serious
we
were
only
allowed
to
stand
for
a
second
in
the
doorway
there
were
others
again
which
we
could
not
see
at
all
i
think
unless
i
am
rolling
two
hospitals
into
one
that
we
saw
a
second
the
english
hospital
it
was
for
the
english
hospital
that
we
heard
the
commandant
inquire
perpetually
as
we
made
our
way
through
the
strange
streets
and
the
boulevards
beyond
them
following
at
his
own
furious
pace
losing
him
in
byways
and
finding
him
by
some
miracle
again
talk
of
dreams
our
progress
through
antwerp
was
like
one
of
those
nightmares
which
have
no
form
or
substance
but
are
made
up
of
ghastly
twilight
and
hopeless
quest
and
speed
it
was
not
till
it
was
all
over
that
we
knew
the
reason
for
his
excessive
haste
when
we
got
to
clair
stobart
hospital
in
a
garden
planted
somewhere
away
beyond
the
boulevards
in
an
open
place
we
had
hardly
any
time
to
look
at
it
all
the
same
i
shall
never
forget
that
hospital
as
long
as
i
live
it
had
been
a
and
was
built
principally
of
glass
and
iron
at
any
rate
if
it
was
not
really
the
greenhouse
that
it
seemed
to
be
there
was
a
great
deal
of
glass
about
it
and
it
had
been
shelled
by
aeroplane
the
night
before
no
great
damage
had
been
done
but
the
sound
and
the
shock
had
terrified
the
wounded
in
their
beds
this
hospital
as
everybody
knows
is
run
entirely
by
women
with
women
doctors
women
surgeons
women
orderlies
clair
stobart
and
some
of
her
gallant
staff
came
out
to
meet
us
on
a
big
verandah
in
front
of
this
fantastic
building
she
and
her
orderlies
in
the
uniform
of
the
british
red
cross
her
surgeons
in
long
white
linen
coats
over
their
skirts
whom
we
are
to
take
back
with
us
to
ghent
was
there
we
asked
for
miss
and
she
came
to
us
finally
in
a
small
room
adjoining
what
must
have
been
the
restaurant
of
the
i
was
shocked
at
her
appearance
she
was
quieter
than
ever
and
her
face
was
grey
and
worn
with
watching
she
looked
as
if
she
could
not
have
held
out
another
night
she
told
us
about
last
night
bombardment
the
effect
of
it
on
this
absurd
greenhouse
must
have
been
terrific
every
day
they
are
expecting
the
bombardment
of
the
town
no
none
of
them
are
leaving
except
two
every
woman
will
stick
to
her
post
till
the
order
comes
to
evacuate
the
hospital
and
then
not
one
will
quit
till
the
last
wounded
man
is
carried
to
the
transport
it
seems
that
miss
is
a
hospital
orderly
and
that
her
duty
is
to
stand
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
with
a
lantern
as
the
ambulances
come
in
and
to
light
them
to
the
door
of
the
hospital
and
then
to
see
that
each
man
has
the
number
of
his
cot
pinned
to
the
breast
of
his
stobart
very
properly
will
have
none
but
trained
women
in
her
hospital
but
even
an
untrained
woman
is
equal
to
holding
a
lantern
and
pinning
on
tickets
so
i
implored
miss
to
let
me
take
her
place
while
she
went
back
to
rest
in
my
room
at
ghent
if
it
was
only
for
one
night
i
used
every
argument
i
could
think
of
and
for
one
second
i
thought
the
best
argument
had
prevailed
but
it
was
only
for
a
second
probably
not
even
for
a
second
miss
may
drop
to
pieces
at
her
post
but
it
is
there
that
she
will
drop
outside
on
the
verandah
the
commandant
was
fairly
ramping
to
be
off
no
i
ca
see
the
hospital
there
is
any
time
to
see
the
hospital
but
miss
could
not
bear
me
not
to
see
it
and
together
we
made
a
surreptitious
bolt
for
it
and
i
did
see
the
hospital
it
was
not
like
any
hospital
you
had
ever
seen
before
except
that
the
wounded
were
all
comfortably
bedded
it
was
more
like
the
of
the
palais
des
fêtes
the
floor
of
the
great
was
covered
with
mattresses
and
beds
where
the
wounded
lay
about
in
every
attitude
of
suffering
no
doubt
everything
was
in
the
most
perfect
order
and
the
nurses
and
doctors
knew
how
to
thread
their
way
through
it
all
but
to
the
hurried
spectator
in
the
doorway
the
effect
was
one
of
the
most
confusion
only
one
object
stood
out
the
large
naked
back
of
a
belgian
soldier
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
waiting
to
be
washed
he
must
have
been
really
the
most
cheerful
and
comparatively
uninjured
figure
in
the
whole
crowd
but
he
seemed
the
most
pitiful
because
of
the
sheer
human
insistence
of
his
pathetic
back
over
this
back
and
over
all
that
prostrate
agony
the
enormous
floriated
bronze
rings
that
carried
the
lights
of
the
hung
from
the
ceiling
in
frightful
festive
decoration
miss
whispered
one
of
them
is
dying
we
ca
save
him
she
seemed
to
regard
this
one
as
a
positive
slur
on
their
record
i
thought
only
one
among
all
that
crowd
stobart
came
after
us
in
some
alarm
as
we
ran
down
the
garden
what
are
you
doing
with
miss
you
not
going
to
carry
her
off
no
i
said
we
not
she
wo
come
but
we
have
got
off
with
stobart
has
refused
the
commandant
offer
of
one
of
our
best
surgeons
in
exchange
he
is
a
man
and
this
hospital
is
a
feminist
show
we
dined
in
a
great
hurry
in
a
big
restaurant
in
one
of
the
main
streets
the
restaurant
was
nearly
empty
and
funereal
black
cloths
were
hung
over
the
windows
to
obscure
the
lights
davidson
this
cheerful
presence
was
with
us
in
our
career
through
antwerp
davidson
and
i
amused
ourselves
by
planning
how
we
will
behave
when
we
are
taken
prisoner
by
the
germans
he
is
safe
because
he
is
an
american
citizen
the
unfortunate
thing
about
me
is
my
passport
otherwise
by
means
of
a
nasal
twang
i
might
get
through
as
an
american
novelist
i
been
mistaken
for
one
often
enough
in
my
own
country
but
as
i
do
mean
to
be
taken
prisoner
and
perhaps
murdered
or
have
my
hands
chopped
off
without
a
struggle
my
plan
is
to
deliver
a
speech
in
german
as
follows
bin
eine
berühmte
on
these
occasions
you
stick
at
nothing
in
england
aber
viel
berühmter
in
den
vereinigten
staaten
und
mein
schicksal
will
den
presidenten
wilson
nicht
gleichgültig
i
added
by
way
of
rhetorical
flourish
as
the
language
went
to
my
head
will
mein
tod
zu
vertheidigen
gut
but
i
was
aware
that
this
was
overdoing
it
davidson
thought
it
would
be
better
on
the
whole
if
he
were
to
pass
me
off
as
his
wife
perhaps
it
would
but
it
seems
a
pity
that
so
much
good
german
should
be
wasted
we
got
up
from
that
dinner
with
even
more
haste
than
we
had
sat
down
all
lights
in
the
town
were
put
out
at
and
we
did
want
to
go
crawling
and
blundering
about
in
the
dark
with
our
ambulance
car
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
the
faster
we
ran
back
to
ghent
the
better
we
left
davidson
and
wilson
in
antwerp
they
were
staying
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
another
awful
struggle
on
the
downward
slope
from
the
quay
to
the
bridge
of
boats
a
bad
jam
at
the
turn
a
sudden
loosening
and
letting
go
of
the
traffic
and
we
were
over
we
ran
back
to
ghent
so
fast
that
at
saint
nicolas
where
we
stopped
to
pick
up
our
poor
little
belgian
professor
we
took
the
wrong
turn
at
the
fork
of
the
road
and
dashed
with
considerable
over
the
dutch
frontier
we
only
realized
it
when
a
sentry
in
an
unfamiliar
uniform
raised
his
rifle
and
prepared
to
fire
not
with
the
cheerful
perfunctory
vigilance
of
our
belgians
but
in
a
determined
manner
and
the
word
achille
imparted
in
a
burst
of
confidence
produced
no
sympathy
whatever
on
the
contrary
this
absurd
sentry
who
had
come
out
of
a
straw
that
was
like
an
enormous
beehive
went
on
pointing
his
rifle
at
us
with
most
unnecessary
persistence
i
was
so
interested
in
seeing
what
he
would
do
next
that
i
missed
the
very
pleasing
behaviour
of
the
little
belgian
professor
who
sat
next
to
me
wrapped
in
his
brown
shawl
he
still
imagined
himself
to
be
on
the
road
to
ghent
and
when
he
saw
that
sentry
continuing
to
prepare
to
fire
in
spite
of
our
password
he
concluded
that
we
and
the
road
to
ghent
were
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
so
he
instantly
ducked
behind
me
for
cover
and
collapsed
on
the
floor
of
the
ambulance
in
his
shawl
then
somebody
said
we
in
holland
and
there
were
shouts
of
laughter
from
everybody
in
the
car
except
the
little
belgian
then
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
dutch
sentries
and
customs
officers
who
enjoyed
this
excellent
joke
as
much
as
we
did
we
were
now
out
of
our
course
by
i
do
know
how
many
miles
and
short
of
petrol
but
one
of
the
customs
officers
gave
us
all
we
wanted
it
the
way
these
dear
belgians
take
the
british
they
have
waited
so
long
for
our
army
believing
that
it
would
come
till
they
could
believe
no
more
in
ghent
in
antwerp
you
would
know
that
belgium
had
any
allies
you
never
see
the
british
flag
or
the
french
either
hanging
from
the
windows
the
black
yellow
and
red
standard
flies
everywhere
alone
now
that
we
come
their
belief
in
us
is
almost
unbearable
they
really
think
we
are
going
to
save
antwerp
somewhere
between
antwerp
and
saint
nicolas
the
population
of
a
whole
village
turned
out
to
meet
us
with
cries
of
anglais
les
anglaises
and
laughed
for
joy
terrible
for
us
who
had
heard
belgians
say
reproachfully
we
thought
that
the
british
would
come
to
our
help
but
they
never
came
they
said
it
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
but
you
could
persuade
them
that
the
british
fought
for
belgium
at
mons
we
got
into
ghent
about
midnight
is
to
stay
at
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
the
mosquitoes
from
the
canal
have
come
up
and
bitten
me
i
was
ill
all
night
with
something
that
felt
like
malarial
fever
if
it
influenza
could
get
up
too
drowsy
came
in
to
see
me
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
also
came
to
hear
at
first
hand
the
story
of
our
run
into
antwerp
he
was
extremely
kind
he
sat
and
looked
at
me
sorrowfully
as
if
he
had
been
the
family
doctor
and
gave
me
some
of
his
very
own
china
tea
in
belgium
in
this
is
one
of
the
most
devoted
things
that
man
can
do
for
his
brother
he
was
so
gentle
and
so
sympathetic
that
my
heart
went
out
to
him
and
i
forgot
all
about
poor
davidson
and
gave
up
to
him
the
whole
splendid
scoop
of
the
british
troops
at
saint
nicolas
i
could
tell
him
much
about
the
run
into
antwerp
no
doubt
it
was
a
thrilling
performance
through
all
the
languor
of
malaria
it
thrills
me
now
when
i
think
of
it
but
it
was
much
to
offer
a
war
correspondent
since
it
took
us
nowhere
near
the
bombardment
it
had
nothing
for
the
psychologist
or
for
the
amateur
of
strange
sensations
and
nothing
for
the
pure
and
ardent
spirit
of
adventure
and
nothing
for
that
insatiable
and
implacable
self
that
drives
you
to
the
abhorred
experiment
determined
to
know
how
you
will
come
out
of
it
for
there
was
no
more
danger
in
the
excursion
than
in
a
run
down
to
brighton
and
back
and
i
know
no
more
of
fear
or
courage
than
i
did
before
i
started
but
now
that
i
realize
what
the
insatiable
and
implacable
self
is
after
how
it
worked
in
me
against
all
decency
and
all
pity
how
it
actually
made
me
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
see
antwerp
under
siege
and
how
the
spirit
of
adventure
backed
it
up
i
can
forgive
the
commandant
i
still
think
that
he
sinned
when
he
took
ursula
dearmer
to
termonde
and
to
alost
but
the
temptation
that
assailed
him
at
alost
and
termonde
was
not
to
be
measured
by
anybody
who
was
not
there
it
must
have
been
irresistible
besides
it
is
not
certain
that
he
did
take
ursula
dearmer
into
danger
it
is
every
bit
as
likely
that
she
took
him
more
likely
still
that
they
were
both
victims
of
fascinated
by
the
lure
of
the
greatest
possible
danger
and
oh
how
i
did
pitch
into
him
i
am
ashamed
of
the
things
i
said
in
that
access
of
insulting
and
indignant
virtue
can
it
be
that
i
was
jealous
of
ursula
dearmer
that
innocent
girl
because
she
saw
a
shell
burst
and
i
did
i
know
this
is
what
was
the
matter
with
torrence
the
other
day
she
even
seemed
to
imply
that
there
was
some
feminine
perfidy
in
ursula
dearmer
power
of
drawing
shells
to
her
she
poor
dear
ca
attract
even
a
bullet
within
a
mile
of
her
lying
there
in
that
room
i
dissolved
into
a
blessed
state
a
beautiful
drowsy
tenderness
to
everybody
a
drowsy
beautiful
forgiveness
of
the
commandant
i
forgot
that
he
intimated
sternly
that
no
ambulance
would
be
at
my
disposal
in
the
flight
from
ghent
i
remember
only
that
he
took
me
into
antwerp
yesterday
and
that
he
could
help
it
if
the
outer
forts
thirty
kilometres
away
and
i
forgive
him
beautifully
and
drowsily
but
when
he
came
running
up
in
great
haste
to
see
me
and
rushed
down
into
the
kitchens
of
the
hotel
to
order
soup
for
me
and
into
the
chemist
shop
in
the
place
to
get
my
medicine
and
ran
back
again
to
give
it
me
before
i
knew
where
i
was
such
is
the
debilitating
influence
of
malaria
instead
of
forgiving
him
i
found
myself
in
abject
contrition
actually
asking
him
to
forgive
it
was
all
wrong
of
course
but
the
mosquitoes
had
bitten
me
rather
badly
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
have
got
to
work
at
last
all
afternoon
and
all
night
yesterday
they
were
busy
between
the
station
and
the
hospitals
removing
the
wounded
from
the
antwerp
trains
and
car
had
no
sooner
got
into
the
yard
of
the
flandria
to
rest
after
its
trip
to
antwerp
and
back
than
it
was
ordered
out
again
with
the
commandant
and
ursula
dearmer
and
torrence
to
meet
the
last
ambulance
train
the
chauffeur
tom
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
the
order
came
he
was
however
found
after
much
search
in
the
park
in
the
company
of
the
cricklewood
bus
and
a
whole
regiment
of
tommies
one
of
these
ambulance
trains
had
been
shelled
by
the
germans
they
could
have
been
very
far
from
us
in
our
run
from
antwerp
it
was
their
nearness
in
fact
that
accounted
for
our
prodigious
haste
and
many
of
the
men
came
in
worse
wounded
than
they
went
out
we
are
all
tremendously
excited
over
the
arrival
of
the
tommies
and
the
cricklewood
bus
we
can
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
relief
of
antwerp
ursula
dearmer
came
to
see
me
she
understands
that
i
have
forgiven
her
that
shell
and
why
she
wore
the
clothes
the
rather
clothes
she
wore
when
she
came
to
see
the
committee
but
oh
how
the
youngest
but
one
has
grown
up
since
then
torrence
came
to
see
me
also
and
janet
mcneil
torrence
though
that
shell
still
rankles
is
greatly
appeased
by
the
labours
of
last
night
so
is
janet
they
told
rather
a
nice
story
a
train
full
of
british
troops
from
ostend
came
into
the
station
yesterday
at
the
same
time
as
the
ambulance
train
from
antwerp
the
two
were
drawn
up
one
on
each
side
of
the
same
platform
when
the
wounded
belgians
saw
the
british
they
struggled
to
their
feet
at
every
window
of
the
ambulance
train
bandaged
heads
were
thrust
out
and
bandaged
hands
waved
and
the
belgians
shouted
but
the
british
stood
dumb
stolid
and
impassive
before
their
enthusiasm
torrence
called
out
give
them
a
cheer
boys
they
the
bravest
little
soldiers
in
the
world
then
the
tommies
let
themselves
go
and
the
station
roof
nearly
flew
off
with
the
explosion
the
corps
worked
till
four
in
the
morning
clearing
out
those
ambulance
trains
the
wards
are
nearly
full
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
malaria
gone
the
commandant
called
to
give
his
report
of
the
ambulance
work
he
torrence
janet
mcneil
ursula
dearmer
and
the
men
were
working
all
yesterday
afternoon
and
evening
till
long
past
dark
at
termonde
the
finest
thing
they
done
yet
the
men
and
the
women
crawled
on
their
hands
and
knees
in
the
trenches
under
the
river
bank
under
fire
ursula
dearmer
that
girl
luck
is
simply
staggering
ursula
dearmer
wandering
adventurously
apart
after
dark
on
the
found
a
young
belgian
officer
badly
wounded
lying
out
under
a
tree
she
could
carry
him
but
she
went
for
two
stretchers
and
three
men
and
they
put
the
young
officer
on
one
stretcher
and
she
trotted
off
with
his
sword
his
cap
and
the
rest
of
his
accoutrements
on
the
other
he
owes
his
life
to
this
manifestation
of
her
luck
wilson
has
come
back
from
antwerp
it
looks
as
if
haynes
and
bird
would
go
at
any
rate
i
think
they
will
give
up
working
on
the
field
ambulance
there
are
enough
cars
for
four
surgeons
four
and
they
have
seen
hardly
any
service
this
is
rather
hard
luck
on
them
as
they
gave
up
their
practice
to
come
out
with
us
naturally
they
do
want
to
waste
any
more
time
i
managed
to
get
some
work
done
wrote
a
paragraph
about
the
ambulance
for
who
will
publish
it
in
the
under
his
name
to
raise
funds
for
us
he
is
more
than
ever
certain
that
it
the
ambulance
is
the
real
thing
also
wrote
an
article
militaire
no
for
the
the
first
bit
of
journalism
i
had
time
or
material
for
shopped
very
affair
went
to
mass
in
the
cathedral
sat
far
back
among
the
refugees
if
you
want
to
know
what
religion
really
is
go
into
a
catholic
church
in
a
catholic
country
under
invasion
you
only
feel
the
tenderness
the
naïveté
of
catholicism
in
in
you
realize
its
power
saw
who
has
been
at
termonde
he
spoke
with
great
praise
of
the
gallantry
of
our
corps
it
odd
either
i
getting
used
to
it
or
it
the
effect
of
that
run
into
antwerp
but
i
no
longer
torn
by
fear
and
anxiety
for
their
safety
dined
with
in
a
restaurant
in
the
town
it
proved
to
be
more
expensive
than
either
of
us
cared
for
our
fried
sole
left
us
hungry
and
yet
as
if
after
an
orgy
suffering
in
a
dreadful
communion
of
guilt
got
up
early
and
went
to
mass
in
the
cathedral
prepared
report
for
british
red
cross
wrote
journal
of
impressions
from
september
to
september
it
slow
work
got
out
of
ostend
yet
fighting
at
zele
got
very
near
the
fighting
this
time
heaven
bless
him
took
me
out
with
him
in
the
war
correspondents
car
to
see
what
the
ambulance
was
doing
at
zele
and
incidentally
to
look
at
the
bombardment
of
some
evacuated
villages
near
it
i
have
no
desire
to
see
the
bombardment
of
any
village
that
has
not
been
evacuated
first
came
too
and
they
brought
a
belgian
lady
with
them
a
charming
and
beautiful
lady
whose
name
i
forget
when
told
me
to
get
up
and
come
with
him
to
zele
i
did
get
up
with
an
energy
and
enthusiasm
that
amazed
me
i
got
up
like
one
who
has
been
summoned
at
last
after
long
waiting
to
a
sure
and
certain
enterprise
i
can
trust
or
any
war
correspondent
who
means
business
as
i
can
not
after
antwerp
trust
the
commandant
so
far
if
the
commandant
happens
upon
a
bombardment
it
has
been
either
in
the
way
of
duty
or
by
sheer
luck
or
both
as
at
alost
and
termonde
when
duty
took
him
to
these
places
and
any
bombardment
or
firing
was
as
it
were
thrown
in
he
did
not
go
out
deliberately
to
seek
it
for
its
own
sake
and
find
it
infallibly
which
is
the
war
correspondent
way
so
that
if
says
there
is
going
to
be
a
bombardment
we
shall
probably
get
somewhere
nearer
to
it
than
thirty
kilometres
we
took
the
main
road
to
zele
i
do
know
whether
it
was
really
a
continuation
of
the
road
that
runs
under
the
hospital
windows
anyhow
we
left
it
very
soon
striking
southwards
to
the
right
to
find
what
believed
to
be
a
short
cut
thus
we
never
got
to
zele
at
all
we
came
out
on
a
good
straight
road
that
would
no
doubt
have
led
us
there
in
time
but
that
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
lured
by
the
smoke
of
the
great
factory
at
schoonard
burning
away
to
the
south
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
believe
that
it
was
smoke
we
saw
and
not
an
enormous
cloud
blown
by
the
wind
across
miles
of
sky
we
seemed
to
run
for
miles
with
that
terrible
banner
streaming
on
our
right
to
the
south
apparently
in
the
same
place
as
far
off
as
ever
east
of
it
on
the
was
a
whole
fleet
of
little
clouds
that
hung
low
over
the
earth
that
rose
from
it
rose
and
were
never
lifted
but
as
they
were
shredded
away
scattered
and
vanished
were
perpetually
renewed
this
movement
of
their
death
and
had
a
horrible
sinister
pulse
in
it
each
cloud
of
this
fleet
of
clouds
was
the
smoke
from
a
burning
village
at
last
after
an
endless
flanking
pursuit
of
the
great
cloud
that
continued
steadily
on
our
right
piling
itself
on
itself
and
mounting
incessantly
we
struck
into
a
side
lane
that
seemed
to
lead
straight
to
the
factory
on
fire
but
in
this
direct
advance
the
cloud
eluded
us
at
every
turn
of
the
lane
now
it
was
rising
straight
in
front
of
us
in
the
south
now
it
was
streaming
away
somewhere
to
the
west
of
our
track
when
we
went
west
it
went
east
when
we
went
east
it
went
west
and
wherever
we
went
we
met
refugees
from
the
burning
villages
they
were
trudging
along
slowly
very
tired
very
miserable
but
with
no
panic
and
no
violent
grief
we
passed
through
villages
and
hamlets
untouched
still
but
waiting
quietly
and
a
little
breathlessly
on
the
edge
of
their
doom
at
the
end
of
one
lane
where
it
turned
straight
to
the
east
round
the
square
of
a
field
we
came
upon
a
great
lake
ringed
with
trees
and
set
in
a
green
place
of
the
most
serene
and
vivid
beauty
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
same
hour
should
bring
us
to
this
magic
stillness
and
peace
and
within
sight
of
the
smoke
of
war
and
within
sound
of
the
guns
at
the
next
turn
we
heard
them
we
still
thought
that
we
could
get
to
schoonard
to
the
burning
factory
and
work
back
to
zele
by
a
slight
round
but
at
this
turn
we
had
lost
sight
of
schoonard
and
the
great
cloud
altogether
and
found
ourselves
in
a
little
hamlet
heaven
knows
where
only
straight
ahead
of
us
as
we
looked
westwards
we
heard
the
guns
the
sound
came
from
somewhere
over
there
and
from
two
quarters
german
guns
booming
away
on
the
south
belgian
french
guns
answering
from
the
north
judging
by
these
sounds
and
those
we
heard
afterwards
we
must
have
been
now
on
the
outer
edge
of
a
line
of
fire
stretching
west
and
east
and
following
the
course
of
the
scheldt
the
germans
were
entrenched
behind
the
river
in
the
little
hamlet
we
asked
our
way
of
a
peasant
as
far
as
we
could
make
out
from
his
mixed
french
and
flemish
he
told
us
to
turn
back
and
take
the
road
we
had
left
where
it
goes
south
to
the
village
of
baerlaere
this
we
did
we
gathered
that
we
could
get
a
road
through
baerlaere
to
schoonard
failing
schoonard
our
way
to
zele
lay
through
baerlaere
in
the
opposite
direction
we
set
off
along
a
very
bad
road
to
baerlaere
coming
into
baerlaere
we
saw
a
house
with
a
remarkable
roof
a
roof
of
black
and
white
tiles
arranged
in
a
sort
of
pattern
i
asked
if
he
had
ever
seen
a
roof
like
that
in
his
life
and
he
replied
promptly
yes
in
china
and
that
roof
if
it
was
coming
into
baerlaere
that
we
saw
it
is
all
that
i
can
remember
of
baerlaere
there
was
i
suppose
the
usual
church
with
its
steeple
where
the
streets
forked
and
the
usual
town
hall
near
it
with
a
flight
of
steps
before
the
door
and
a
classic
pediment
and
the
usual
double
line
of
houses
i
do
seem
to
remember
these
things
as
if
they
had
really
been
there
but
you
could
see
the
bottom
half
of
the
houses
for
the
troops
that
were
crowded
in
front
of
them
or
the
top
half
for
the
shells
you
tried
to
see
and
did
they
were
sweeping
high
up
over
the
roofs
making
for
the
entrenchments
and
the
batteries
beyond
the
village
we
had
come
bang
into
the
middle
of
an
artillery
duel
it
was
going
on
at
a
range
of
about
a
mile
and
a
half
but
all
over
our
heads
so
that
though
we
heard
it
with
great
intensity
we
saw
nothing
there
were
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
between
the
firing
the
belgian
french
batteries
were
pounding
away
on
the
left
quite
near
the
booming
seemed
to
come
from
behind
the
houses
at
our
backs
and
the
german
on
the
right
farther
away
now
you
may
have
hated
and
dreaded
the
sound
of
guns
all
your
life
as
you
hate
and
dread
any
immense
and
violent
noise
but
there
is
something
about
the
sound
of
the
first
near
gun
of
your
first
battle
that
so
far
from
being
hateful
or
dreadful
or
in
any
way
abhorrent
to
you
will
make
you
smile
in
spite
of
yourself
with
a
kind
of
quiet
exultation
mixed
very
oddly
with
reminiscence
so
that
though
your
first
impression
by
no
means
disagreeable
is
of
being
in
for
it
your
next
after
the
second
and
the
third
gun
is
that
of
having
been
in
for
it
many
times
before
the
effect
on
your
nerves
is
now
like
that
of
being
in
a
very
small
in
a
very
sea
you
climb
wave
after
high
wave
and
are
not
swallowed
up
as
you
expected
you
wait
between
guns
for
the
boom
and
the
shock
of
the
next
with
a
passionate
anticipation
as
you
wait
for
the
next
wave
and
the
sound
of
the
gun
when
it
comes
is
like
the
exhilarating
smack
of
the
wave
that
you
and
your
boat
mean
to
resist
and
do
resist
when
it
gets
you
you
do
not
think
as
you
used
to
think
when
you
sat
safe
in
your
little
house
in
john
wood
how
terrible
it
is
that
shells
should
be
hurtling
through
the
air
and
killing
men
by
whole
regiments
you
do
not
think
at
all
nobody
anywhere
near
you
is
thinking
that
sort
of
thing
or
thinking
very
much
at
all
at
the
sound
of
the
first
near
gun
i
found
myself
looking
across
the
road
at
a
french
soldier
we
were
smiling
at
each
other
when
we
tried
to
get
to
schoonard
from
the
west
end
of
the
town
we
were
stopped
and
turned
back
by
the
general
in
command
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
this
after
some
parley
with
various
officers
decided
not
to
go
back
in
ignominious
safety
by
the
way
we
came
but
to
push
on
from
the
east
end
of
the
village
into
the
open
country
through
the
line
of
fire
that
stretched
between
us
and
the
road
to
zele
on
our
way
while
we
were
about
it
he
said
we
might
as
well
stop
and
have
a
look
at
the
belgian
batteries
at
work
as
if
he
had
said
we
might
as
well
stop
at
olympia
and
have
a
look
at
the
motor
show
on
our
way
to
richmond
at
this
point
the
unhappy
chauffeur
who
had
not
found
himself
by
any
means
at
home
in
baerlaere
remarked
that
he
had
a
wife
and
family
dependent
on
him
replied
with
dignity
that
he
had
a
wife
and
family
too
and
that
we
all
had
somebody
or
something
and
that
war
correspondents
can
not
afford
to
think
of
their
wives
and
families
at
these
moments
face
backed
up
with
an
expression
of
extreme
determination
the
little
belgian
lady
smiled
placidly
and
imperturbably
with
an
air
of
being
ready
to
go
anywhere
where
these
intrepid
englishmen
should
see
fit
to
take
her
i
felt
a
little
sorry
for
the
chauffeur
he
had
been
out
with
the
war
correspondents
several
times
already
and
i
had
we
left
him
and
his
car
behind
us
in
the
village
squeezed
very
tight
against
a
stable
wall
that
stood
between
them
and
the
german
fire
we
four
went
on
a
little
way
beyond
the
village
and
turned
into
a
bridle
path
across
the
open
fields
at
the
bottom
of
a
field
to
our
left
was
a
small
slump
of
willows
we
had
heard
the
belgian
guns
firing
from
that
direction
a
few
minutes
before
we
concluded
that
the
battery
was
concealed
behind
the
willows
we
strolled
on
like
one
half
of
a
picnic
party
that
has
been
divided
and
is
looking
innocently
for
the
other
half
in
a
likely
place
but
as
we
came
nearer
to
the
willows
we
lost
our
clue
the
battery
had
evidently
made
up
its
mind
not
to
fire
as
long
as
we
were
in
sight
like
the
cloud
of
smoke
from
the
schoonard
factory
it
eluded
us
successfully
and
indeed
it
is
hardly
the
way
of
batteries
to
choose
positions
where
interested
war
correspondents
can
come
out
and
find
them
so
we
went
back
to
the
village
where
we
found
the
infantry
being
drawn
up
in
order
and
doing
something
to
its
rifles
for
one
thrilling
moment
i
imagined
that
the
germans
were
about
to
leap
out
of
their
trenches
and
rush
the
village
and
that
the
belgians
french
were
preparing
for
a
bayonet
charge
in
that
case
i
thought
we
shall
be
very
useful
in
picking
up
the
wounded
and
carrying
them
away
in
that
car
i
never
thought
of
the
ugly
rush
and
the
horrors
after
it
it
is
extraordinary
how
your
mind
can
put
away
from
it
any
thought
that
would
make
life
insupportable
but
no
they
were
not
fixing
bayonets
they
were
not
doing
anything
to
their
rifles
they
were
only
stacking
them
it
was
then
that
you
thought
of
the
ugly
rush
and
were
glad
that
after
all
it
would
happen
you
were
glad
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
same
gladness
there
was
a
little
sense
of
disappointment
unaccountable
unpardonable
and
not
quite
sane
one
of
the
men
showed
us
a
burst
shrapnel
shell
we
examined
it
with
great
interest
as
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
most
likely
to
hit
us
on
our
way
from
baerlaere
to
zele
we
had
been
barely
half
an
hour
hanging
about
baerlaere
but
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
wasted
a
whole
afternoon
there
at
last
we
started
we
were
told
to
drive
fast
as
the
fire
might
open
on
us
at
any
minute
we
drove
very
fast
our
road
lay
through
open
country
flat
to
the
river
with
no
sort
of
cover
anywhere
from
the
german
fire
if
it
chose
to
come
about
half
a
mile
ahead
of
us
was
a
small
hamlet
that
had
been
shelled
told
us
to
duck
when
we
heard
the
guns
i
remember
thinking
that
i
particularly
did
want
to
be
wounded
in
my
right
arm
and
that
as
i
sat
with
my
right
arm
resting
on
the
ledge
of
the
car
it
was
somewhat
exposed
to
the
german
batteries
so
i
wriggled
low
down
in
my
seat
and
tucked
my
arm
well
under
cover
for
quite
five
minutes
but
you
see
anything
that
way
so
i
popped
up
again
and
presently
forgot
all
about
my
valuable
arm
in
the
sheer
excitement
of
the
rush
through
the
danger
zone
our
car
was
low
on
the
ground
still
it
was
high
enough
and
big
enough
to
serve
as
a
mark
for
the
german
guns
and
it
fairly
gave
them
the
range
of
the
road
but
though
the
guns
had
been
pounding
away
before
we
started
they
ceased
firing
as
we
went
through
that
however
was
sheer
luck
and
presently
it
was
brought
home
to
me
that
we
were
not
the
only
persons
involved
in
the
risk
of
this
joyous
adventure
just
outside
the
bombarded
hamlet
ahead
of
us
we
were
stopped
by
some
belgian
french
soldiers
hidden
in
the
cover
of
a
ditch
by
the
roadside
which
if
it
was
not
a
trench
might
very
easily
have
been
one
they
were
talking
in
whispers
for
fear
of
being
overheard
by
the
germans
who
must
have
been
at
least
a
mile
off
across
the
fields
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
mile
seemed
a
pretty
safe
distance
but
said
it
would
help
us
much
considering
that
the
range
of
their
guns
was
miles
the
soldiers
told
us
we
possibly
get
through
to
zele
that
was
true
the
road
was
blocked
by
the
ruins
of
the
hamlet
not
twenty
yards
from
where
we
were
pulled
up
we
got
out
of
the
car
and
while
and
the
belgian
lady
conversed
with
the
soldiers
and
i
walked
on
to
investigate
the
road
at
the
abrupt
end
of
a
short
row
of
houses
it
stopped
where
it
should
have
turned
suddenly
and
became
a
lying
in
a
waste
place
just
at
first
i
thought
we
must
have
gone
out
of
our
course
somehow
and
missed
the
road
to
zele
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
this
lying
in
a
waste
place
ever
been
a
road
but
for
the
shell
of
a
house
that
stood
next
to
it
the
last
of
the
row
and
the
piles
of
lath
and
plaster
and
the
shattered
glass
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
blown
dust
everywhere
it
might
have
passed
for
the
ordinary
of
an
abandoned
made
me
keep
close
under
the
wall
of
a
barn
or
something
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
only
thing
that
stood
between
us
and
the
german
batteries
beyond
the
barn
were
the
green
fields
bare
to
the
guns
that
had
shelled
this
end
of
the
village
at
first
we
hugged
our
shelter
tight
only
looking
out
now
and
then
round
the
corner
of
the
barn
into
the
open
country
a
flat
field
a
low
line
of
willows
at
the
bottom
and
somewhere
behind
the
willows
the
german
batteries
grey
puffs
were
still
curling
about
the
stems
and
clinging
to
the
tops
of
the
willows
they
might
have
been
mist
from
the
river
or
smoke
from
the
guns
we
had
heard
i
had
time
to
watch
them
for
suddenly
darted
from
his
cover
and
made
an
alarming
sally
into
the
open
field
he
said
he
wanted
to
find
some
pieces
of
nice
hot
shell
for
me
so
i
had
to
run
out
after
and
tell
him
i
did
want
any
pieces
of
hot
shell
and
pull
him
back
into
safety
all
for
nothing
not
a
gun
fired
we
strolled
across
what
was
left
of
the
narrow
street
and
looked
through
the
of
a
shattered
house
it
had
been
a
little
inn
the
roof
and
walls
of
the
parlour
had
been
wrecked
so
had
most
of
the
furniture
but
on
a
table
against
the
inner
wall
a
row
of
clean
glasses
still
stood
in
their
order
as
the
landlord
had
left
them
and
not
one
of
them
was
broken
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
about
time
for
the
guns
to
begin
firing
again
for
called
to
us
to
come
back
and
to
look
sharp
too
so
we
ran
for
it
and
as
we
leaped
into
the
car
reproved
gravely
and
virtuously
for
taking
a
lady
into
danger
the
car
rushed
back
into
baerlaere
if
anything
faster
than
it
had
rushed
out
sitting
bolt
upright
with
an
air
of
great
majesty
and
integrity
i
remember
thinking
that
it
would
never
never
do
to
duck
if
the
shells
came
for
if
we
did
head
would
stand
out
like
a
noble
monument
and
he
would
be
hit
as
infallibly
as
any
cathedral
in
belgium
it
seems
that
the
soldiers
were
not
particularly
pleased
at
our
blundering
up
against
their
trench
in
our
noisy
car
which
they
said
might
draw
down
the
german
fire
at
any
minute
on
the
belgian
lines
we
got
into
ghent
after
dark
by
the
way
we
came
called
at
the
flandria
ursula
dearmer
and
two
belgian
nurses
have
been
sent
to
the
convent
at
zele
to
work
there
is
here
but
you
would
know
him
i
have
just
been
introduced
to
him
without
knowing
him
before
the
war
he
was
a
quaker
a
teetotaller
and
a
pacifist
at
any
price
and
i
suppose
he
wore
clothes
that
conformed
more
or
less
to
his
principles
now
he
is
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
british
naval
officer
he
is
drinking
long
in
the
restaurant
in
the
society
of
major
and
the
major
khaki
does
give
a
point
to
the
quaker
uniform
as
for
the
quaker
they
say
he
could
give
points
to
any
able
seaman
when
it
comes
to
swear
words
but
this
may
be
sheer
affectionate
exaggeration
his
face
and
his
high
hatchet
nose
whatever
colour
they
used
to
be
are
now
the
colour
of
copper
not
an
ordinary
dutch
kettle
and
pacifist
copper
but
a
fine
old
truculent
bloody
ammunition
copper
and
battered
by
the
wars
of
all
the
world
he
is
the
commander
and
the
owner
of
an
armoured
car
one
of
the
unit
of
five
volunteer
armoured
cars
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
happy
or
unhappy
when
there
was
a
war
no
man
and
certainly
no
quaker
could
possibly
be
happier
than
this
quaker
is
now
he
and
the
major
have
been
out
potting
germans
all
the
afternoon
they
have
accounted
for
nine
a
schoolboy
who
has
hit
the
mark
nine
times
running
with
his
first
toy
rifle
is
not
merrier
than
if
as
merry
as
these
more
than
mature
men
with
their
armoured
car
they
do
not
say
much
but
you
gather
that
it
is
more
fun
being
a
volunteer
than
a
regular
it
is
to
enjoy
delight
with
liberty
the
maximum
of
risk
with
the
minimum
of
responsibility
and
their
armoured
car
if
it
is
the
one
i
saw
standing
in
the
place
it
is
as
far
as
you
can
make
out
through
its
disguises
an
ordinary
open
touring
car
with
a
wooden
hoarding
mere
matchboard
stuck
all
round
it
the
whole
painted
grey
to
simulate
armoured
painting
through
four
holes
fore
and
aft
and
on
either
side
of
her
their
rake
the
horizon
the
major
and
sit
inside
hidden
behind
the
matchboard
plating
they
scour
the
country
when
they
see
any
germans
they
fire
and
bring
them
down
it
is
quite
simple
when
you
inquire
how
they
can
regard
that
old
wooden
as
an
armoured
cover
they
reply
that
their
car
is
for
defence
it
for
attack
the
germans
have
only
to
see
their
guns
and
they
off
and
really
it
looks
like
it
since
the
two
are
actually
here
before
your
eyes
drinking
and
the
rest
of
the
armoured
car
corps
are
alive
somewhere
in
ghent
dear
major
and
whom
i
never
met
before
unless
they
read
this
journal
which
is
likely
they
will
never
know
how
my
heart
warmed
towards
them
nor
how
happy
i
count
myself
in
being
allowed
to
see
them
they
showed
me
how
good
it
is
to
be
alive
how
excellent
above
all
things
to
be
a
man
and
to
be
young
for
ever
and
to
go
out
into
the
most
gigantic
war
in
history
sitting
in
an
armoured
car
which
is
as
a
for
safety
and
to
have
been
a
pacifist
that
is
to
say
a
sinner
like
so
that
on
the
top
of
it
you
feel
the
whole
glamour
and
glory
of
conversion
others
may
have
known
the
agony
and
the
fear
and
sordid
filth
and
horror
and
the
waste
but
they
know
nothing
but
the
clean
and
fiery
passion
and
the
contagious
ecstasy
of
war
if
you
were
to
tell
about
the
mystic
fascination
of
the
road
the
road
that
leads
eventually
to
waterloo
he
would
most
certainly
understand
you
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
he
would
let
you
venture
very
far
down
it
whereas
the
commandant
sooner
or
later
will
had
breakfast
with
went
down
to
the
flandria
they
say
zele
has
been
taken
there
has
been
terrific
anxiety
here
for
ursula
dearmer
and
the
two
belgian
nurses
madame
daughter
and
niece
who
were
left
there
all
night
in
the
convent
which
may
very
well
be
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
by
now
an
ambulance
car
went
off
very
early
this
morning
to
their
rescue
and
has
brought
them
back
safe
we
are
told
that
the
germans
are
really
advancing
on
ghent
we
have
orders
to
prepare
to
leave
it
at
a
minute
notice
this
time
it
looks
as
if
there
might
be
something
in
it
i

to
the

accepting
the

and

she
has
raised
in
glasgow
her
idea
is
that
her
ambulance
should
be
an
independent
unit
attached
to
our
corps
but
bearing
her
name
seems
rather
a
pity
to
bring
the
poor
lady
out
just
now
when
things
are
beginning
to
be
risky
and
our
habitations
uncertain
the
british
troops
are
pouring
into
ghent
there
is
a
whole
crowd
of
them
in
the
in
front
of
the
station
and
some
british
wounded
from

are
in
our

lambert
has
gone
to
lokeren
with
her
husband
in
his
car
i
was
sent
for
this
morning
by
somebody
who
desired
to
see
the
english
field
ambulance
drawn
up
before
the
hospital
i
found
all
that
was
left
of
a
hendon
bus
in
the
charge
of
two
british
red
cross
volunteers
in
khaki
and
a
british
tar
the
three
were
smiling
in
full
enjoyment
of
the
high
comedy
of
disaster
they
said
they
were
looking
for
a
job
and
they
wanted
to
know
if
our
ambulance
would
take
them
on
they
were
keen
they
had
every
qualification
under
the
sun
only
they
said
there
one
thing
we
bar
and
that
the
we
been
under
for
fifteen
hours
and
look
at
our
bus
the
bus
was
a
thing
of
heroism
and
gorgeous
ruin
the
nose
of
its
engine
looked
as
if
it
had
nuzzled
its
way
through
a
thousand
its
sides
were
coated
with
dust
and
mud
to
the
colour
of
an
armoured
car
the
letters
were
barely
discernible
through
the
grey
its
windows
were
shattered
to
mere
jags
and
spikes
and
splinters
of
glass
that
adhered
marvellously
to
their
frames
i
do
know
how
i
managed
to
convey
to
the
three
volunteers
that
such
a
bus
would
be
about
as
much
use
to
our
field
ambulance
as
an
old
greenhouse
that
had
come
through
an
earthquake
it
was
one
of
the
saddest
things
i
ever
had
to
do
unperturbed
and
still
credulous
of
adventure
they
climbed
on
to
their
bus
turned
her
nose
round
and
went
smiling
away
who
they
were
and
what
corps
they
belonged
to
and
how
they
acquired
that
metropolitan
bus
i
shall
never
know
and
do
not
want
to
know
i
would
far
rather
think
of
them
as
the
heroes
of
some
fantastic
enterprise
careering
in
gladness
and
in
mystery
from
one
besieged
city
to
another
saw
madame
who
looks
worried
she
suggested
that
i
should
come
back
to
the
hospital
she
says
it
must
be
inconvenient
for
the
commandant
not
to
have
his
secretary
always
at
hand
at
the
same
time
we
are
told
that
the
hospital
is
filling
up
so
fast
that
our
rooms
will
be
wanted
and
anyhow
has
got
mine
i
have
found
an
absurd
little
hotel
the
hôtel
cecil
in
the
opposite
the
hospital
where
i
can
have
a
room
then
i
can
be
on
duty
all
day
went
down
to
the
poste
gave
up
my
room
packed
and
took
leave
of
the
nice
fat
and
his
wife
driving
through
the
town
i
meet
french
troops
pouring
through
the
streets
there
was
very
little
cheering
settled
into
the
hôtel
cecil
if
it
could
be
called
settling
when
my
things
have
to
stay
packed
in
case
the
germans
come
before
the
evening
the
hôtel
cecil
is
a
thin
slice
of
a
house
with
three
rooms
on
each
little
floor
and
a
staircase
like
a
ladder
there
is
something
very
sinister
about
this
smallness
and
narrowness
and
steepness
you
say
to
yourself
supposing
the
germans
really
do
come
into
ghent
there
will
be
some
uhlans
among
them
and
the
uhlans
will
certainly
come
into
the
hôtel
cecil
and
they
will
get
very
drunk
in
the
restaurant
below
and
you
might
as
well
be
in
a
trap
as
in
this
den
at
the
top
of
the
slice
up
all
these
abominable
little
steep
stairs
and
you
are
very
glad
that
your
room
has
a
balcony
but
though
your
room
has
a
balcony
it
has
got
a
table
or
any
space
where
a
table
could
stand
there
is
hardly
anything
in
it
but
a
big
double
bed
and
a
tall
i
have
never
seen
a
room
more
inappropriate
to
a
secretary
and
reporter
the
proprietor
and
his
wife
are
very
amiable
he
is
a
red
cross
man
and
they
have
taken
two
refugee
women
into
their
house
they
have
promised
faithfully
that
by
noon
there
shall
be
a
table
noon
has
come
and
there
is
no
table
the
cars
have
come
back
from
lokeren
and
nazareth
full
of
wounded
lambert
and
her
husband
have
come
back
from
lokeren
they
drove
right
into
the
german
lines
to
fetch
two
wounded
they
were
promptly
arrested
and
as
promptly
released
when
their
passports
had
shown
them
to
be
good
american
citizens
they
brought
back
their
two
wounded
altogether
ten
or
fifteen
wounded
have
been
brought
back
from
lokeren
this
morning
the
commandant
has
taken
me
out
with
the
ambulance
for
the
first
time
we
were
to
go
to
lokeren
on
the
way
we
came
up
with
the
lamberts
in
their
they
asked
me
to
get
out
of
the
ambulance
car
and
come
with
them
on
the
whole
after
this
morning
it
looked
as
if
the
promised
better
incident
so
i
threw
in
my
lot
with
the
lamberts
it
was
a
little
disappointing
for
no
sooner
had
the
ambulance
car
got
clean
away
than
the
broke
down
also
lambert
stated
that
it
was
not
his
intention
to
take
lambert
into
the
german
lines
again
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
we
waited
for
an
exasperating
twenty
minutes
while
the
car
got
righted
from
our
street
in
a
blue
transparent
sky
so
high
up
that
it
seemed
part
of
the
transparency
we
saw
a
taube
hanging
over
ghent
people
came
out
of
their
houses
and
watched
it
with
interest
and
a
kind
of
amiable
toleration
at
last
we
got
off
and
the
made
such
good
running
that
we
came
up
with
our
ambulance
in
a
small
town
between
ghent
and
lokeren
we
stopped
here
to
confer
with
the
belgian
army
medical
officers
they
told
us
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
to
lokeren
lokeren
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
the
wounded
had
been
brought
into
a
small
village
about
two
miles
away
when
we
got
into
the
village
we
were
told
to
go
back
at
once
for
the
germans
were
coming
in
the
commandant
answered
that
we
had
come
to
fetch
the
wounded
and
were
certainly
not
going
back
without
them
it
seemed
that
there
were
only
four
wounded
and
they
had
been
taken
into
houses
in
the
village
we
were
given
five
minutes
to
get
them
out
and
go
i
suppose
we
stayed
in
that
village
quite
of
an
hour
it
was
one
straight
street
of
small
houses
and
beyond
the
last
house
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
flat
road
a
quiet
grey
road
between
tall
slender
trees
then
the
turn
and
behind
the
turn
the
germans
were
expected
to
come
in
from
lokeren
every
minute
and
we
had
to
find
the
houses
and
the
wounded
men
the
commandant
went
into
the
first
house
and
came
out
again
very
quickly
the
man
in
the
room
inside
was
dead
we
went
on
up
the
village
down
that
quiet
road
and
through
the
village
swerving
into
the
rough
sandy
track
that
fringed
the
paved
street
a
battery
of
belgian
artillery
came
clattering
in
full
retreat
the
leader
turned
his
horse
violently
into
a
side
alley
and
plunged
down
it
i
was
close
behind
the
battery
when
it
turned
i
could
see
the
faces
of
the
men
they
had
not
that
terrible
look
that
davidson
told
me
he
saw
on
the
faces
of
belgians
in
retreat
from
zele
there
was
no
terror
in
them
only
a
sort
of
sullen
annoyance
and
disgust
i
was
walking
beside
the
commandant
and
how
i
managed
to
get
mixed
up
with
this
battery
i
do
know
first
of
all
it
held
me
up
when
it
turned
then
when
i
got
through
it
still
came
on
and
cut
me
off
from
the
commandant
the
rest
of
the
corps
were
with
the
ambulance
in
the
middle
of
the
village
then
through
the
plunging
train
i
caught
sight
of
the
innocent
commandant
all
by
himself
strolling
serenely
towards
the
open
road
where
beyond
the
bend
the
germans
were
presumably
pursuing
the
battery
it
was
terribly
alarming
to
see
the
commandant
advancing
to
meet
them
all
alone
without
a
word
of
german
to
protect
him
there
were
gaps
in
the
retreat
and
i
dashed
through
one
of
them
as
you
dash
through
the
traffic
in
the
strand
when
you
in
a
hurry
and
went
after
the
commandant
with
the
brilliant
idea
of
defending
him
with
a
volley
of
bad
german
hurled
at
the
enemy
head
and
the
commandant
went
on
indifferent
both
to
his
danger
and
to
his
salvation
and
disappeared
down
a
little
lane
and
into
a
house
where
a
wounded
man
was
i
stood
at
the
end
of
the
lane
with
the
sublime
intention
of
guarding
it
the
commandant
came
out
presently
he
looked
as
if
he
were
steeped
in
a
large
vague
leisure
and
he
asked
me
to
go
and
find
lambert
and
his
lambert
had
got
to
go
to
lokeren
to
fetch
some
wounded
so
i
ran
back
down
the
village
and
found
lambert
and
his
car
at
the
other
end
of
it
he
accepted
his
destiny
with
a
beautiful
transatlantic
calm
and
dashed
off
to
lokeren
i
do
not
think
he
took
his
wife
with
him
this
time
i
went
back
to
see
if
the
germans
had
got
any
nearer
to
the
commandant
they
had
what
with
dressings
and
bandages
and
looking
for
wounded
the
ambulance
must
have
worked
for
about
half
an
hour
and
not
any
germans
had
turned
the
corner
yet
it
was
still
busy
getting
its
load
safely
stowed
away
nothing
for
the
wretched
secretary
to
do
but
to
stand
there
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
looking
up
the
road
to
lokeren
there
was
a
most
singular
fascination
about
the
turn
of
that
road
beyond
the
trees
suddenly
at
what
seemed
the
last
minute
of
safety
two
belgian
without
a
stretcher
rushed
up
to
me
they
said
there
was
a
man
badly
wounded
in
some
house
somewhere
up
the
road
i
found
a
stretcher
and
went
off
with
them
to
look
for
him
we
went
on
and
on
up
the
road
it
could
have
been
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
really
if
as
much
but
it
felt
like
going
on
and
on
it
seemed
impossible
to
find
that
house
there
was
something
odd
about
that
short
stretch
of
grey
road
and
the
tall
trees
at
the
end
of
it
and
the
turn
these
things
appeared
in
a
queer
vivid
stillness
as
if
they
were
not
there
on
their
own
account
but
stood
in
witness
to
some
superior
reality
through
them
you
were
somehow
assured
of
reality
with
a
most
singular
and
overpowering
certainty
you
were
aware
of
the
possibility
of
an
ensuing
agony
and
horror
as
of
something
unreal
and
transitory
that
would
break
through
the
peace
of
it
in
a
merely
episodical
manner
whatever
happened
to
come
round
the
turn
of
the
road
would
simply
not
matter
and
with
your
own
quick
movements
up
the
road
there
came
that
steadily
mounting
thrill
which
is
not
excitement
or
anything
in
the
least
like
excitement
because
of
its
extreme
quietness
this
thrill
is
apt
to
cheat
you
by
stopping
short
of
the
ecstasy
it
seems
to
promise
but
this
time
it
did
stop
short
it
became
more
and
more
steady
and
more
and
more
quiet
in
the
swing
of
its
vibration
it
became
ecstasy
it
became
intense
happiness
it
lasted
till
we
reached
the
little
plantation
by
the
roadside
while
it
lasted
you
had
the
sense
of
touching
reality
at
its
highest
point
in
a
secure
and
effortless
consummation
so
far
were
you
from
being
strung
up
to
any
pitch
then
came
the
plantation
behind
the
plantation
on
a
railway
siding
a
train
came
up
from
lokeren
with
yet
another
load
of
wounded
and
in
the
train
there
was
confusion
and
agitation
and
fear
belgian
red
cross
men
hung
out
by
the
doors
of
the
train
and
clamoured
excitedly
for
stretchers
there
was
only
one
stretcher
the
one
we
had
brought
from
the
village
somebody
complained
bitterly
mal
arrangé
avec
les
allemands
sur
nos
dos
somebody
tried
to
grab
our
one
stretcher
the
two
bearers
seemed
inclined
to
give
it
up
nobody
knew
where
our
badly
wounded
man
was
nobody
seemed
very
eager
now
to
go
and
look
for
him
we
three
were
surrounded
and
ordered
to
give
up
our
stretcher
no
use
wasting
time
in
hunting
for
one
man
with
the
germans
on
our
backs
none
of
the
men
we
were
helping
out
of
the
train
were
seriously
hurt
i
had
to
choose
between
my
one
badly
wounded
man
whom
we
had
found
and
about
a
dozen
who
could
stumble
somehow
into
safety
but
my
two
were
wavering
badly
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
them
firmly
to
their
job
then
three
women
came
out
of
a
little
house
half
hidden
by
the
plantation
they
spoke
low
for
fear
the
germans
should
overhear
them
he
is
here
they
said
he
is
here
the
hurried
off
with
their
stretcher
the
train
unloaded
itself
somehow
the
man
horribly
hurt
with
a
wound
like
a
red
pit
below
his
was
brought
out
and
laid
on
the
stretcher
he
lay
there
quietly
on
his
side
in
a
posture
of
utter
resignation
to
anguish
he
was
a
flamand
clumsily
built
he
had
a
broad
rather
ugly
face
narrowing
suddenly
as
the
fringe
of
his
whiskers
became
a
little
straggling
beard
but
to
me
he
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
loved
him
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
love
to
adore
any
creature
more
than
i
loved
and
adored
that
clumsy
ugly
flamand
he
was
my
first
wounded
man
for
i
tried
i
still
try
to
persuade
myself
that
if
i
had
bullied
my
two
bearers
and
repulsed
the
attack
on
my
stretcher
he
would
have
been
left
behind
in
the
little
house
in
the
plantation
we
got
him
out
of
the
plantation
all
right
and
on
to
the
paved
road
ursula
dearmer
at
termonde
with
her
belgian
officer
and
at
zele
with
all
her
wounded
could
have
been
happier
than
i
was
with
my
one
flamand
we
got
him
a
few
yards
down
the
road
all
right
then
to
my
horror
the
bearers
dumped
him
down
on
the
they
said
he
was
much
too
heavy
they
could
possibly
carry
him
any
more
unless
they
rested
i
did
think
it
was
exactly
the
moment
for
resting
and
i
told
them
so
the
germans
had
come
round
the
turn
and
probably
never
would
come
still
you
never
know
and
the
general
impression
seemed
to
be
that
they
were
about
due
but
the
bearers
stood
stolidly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
mopped
their
faces
and
puffed
the
situation
began
to
feel
as
absurd
and
as
terrible
as
a
nightmare
so
i
grabbed
one
end
of
the
stretcher
and
said
i
carry
it
myself
i
said
i
was
very
strong
and
perhaps
i
could
carry
it
but
anyhow
i
try
they
picked
it
up
at
once
then
and
went
off
at
a
good
swinging
trot
over
the
that
jolted
my
poor
flamand
most
horribly
i
told
them
to
go
on
the
smooth
track
at
the
side
they
hailed
this
suggestion
as
a
most
brilliant
and
original
idea
as
the
flamand
was
brought
into
the
village
the
ambulance
had
got
its
wounded
in
and
was
ready
to
go
but
he
had
to
have
his
wound
dressed
he
lay
there
on
his
stretcher
in
the
middle
of
the
village
street
my
beloved
flamand
stripped
to
the
waist
with
the
great
red
pit
of
his
wound
yawning
in
his
white
flesh
i
had
to
look
on
while
the
commandant
stuffed
it
with
antiseptic
gauze
i
had
always
supposed
that
the
dressing
of
a
wound
was
a
cautious
and
delicate
process
but
it
is
there
is
a
certain
casual
audacity
about
it
the
commandant
hands
worked
rapidly
as
he
rammed
cyanide
gauze
into
the
red
pit
it
looked
as
if
he
were
stuffing
an
old
crate
with
straw
and
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
there
seemed
something
indecent
in
the
haste
with
which
my
flamand
was
disposed
of
when
the
commandant
observed
that
my
flamand
wound
looked
much
worse
than
it
was
i
felt
hurt
as
if
this
beloved
person
had
been
slighted
also
as
if
there
was
some
subtle
disparagement
to
my
find
i
rather
hoped
that
we
were
going
to
wait
till
the
men
i
had
left
behind
in
the
plantation
had
come
up
but
the
car
was
fairly
full
and
ursula
dearmer
and
janet
and
lambert
were
told
off
to
take
it
in
to
z
leave
the
wounded
there
and
come
back
for
the
rest
i
was
to
walk
to
z
and
wait
there
for
the
returning
car
nothing
would
have
pleased
me
better
but
the
distance
was
farther
than
the
commandant
realized
farther
perhaps
than
was
desirable
in
the
circumstances
so
i
was
ordered
to
get
on
the
car
and
come
back
with
it
tom
the
chauffeur
is
perfectly
right
there
are
too
many
of
us
we
got
away
long
before
the
germans
turned
the
corner
if
they
ever
did
turn
it
in
z
which
is
between
lokeren
and
ghent
we
came
upon
six
or
seven
fine
military
ambulances
all
huddled
together
as
if
they
sought
safety
in
companionship
why
none
of
them
had
been
sent
up
to
our
village
i
ca
imagine
ursula
dearmer
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
commandeered
one
of
these
and
went
back
with
it
to
the
village
so
that
we
could
take
our
load
of
wounded
into
ghent
we
did
this
and
went
back
at
once
the
return
journey
was
a
tame
affair
before
we
got
to
z
we
met
the
commandant
and
the
chaplain
and
two
refugees
in
towed
by
a
it
had
broken
down
on
the
way
from
lokeren
we
took
them
on
board
and
turned
back
to
ghent
the
wounded
came
on
in
ursula
dearmer
military
car
wounded
in
all
were
taken
from
lokeren
or
near
it
hundreds
had
to
be
left
behind
in
the
german
lines
we
have
heard
that
antwerp
is
burning
that
the
government
is
removed
to
ostend
that
all
the
english
have
left
there
are
a
great
many
british
wounded
with
nurses
and
army
doctors
in
ghent
three
or
four
british
have
been
brought
into
the
flandria
one
of
them
is
a
young
british
officer
he
is
said
to
be
mortally
wounded
haynes
and
bird
have
not
gone
they
and
have
joined
the
surgical
staff
of
the
hospital
and
are
working
in
the
operating
theatre
all
day
they
have
got
enough
to
do
now
in
all
conscience
all
night
there
has
been
a
sound
of
the
firing
of
machine
guns
at
first
it
was
like
the
barking
of
all
the
dogs
in
belgium
i
thought
it
the
dogs
of
belgium
till
i
discovered
a
deadly
rhythm
and
precision
in
the
barking
the
hospital
is
so
full
that
beds
have
been
put
in
the
entrance
hall
along
the
walls
by
the
big
ward
and
the
secretarial
bureau
in
the
recess
by
the
ward
there
are
three
british
soldiers
there
are
some
men
standing
about
there
whose
heads
and
faces
are
covered
with
a
thick
white
mask
of
like
a
diver
helmet
there
are
three
small
holes
in
each
white
mask
for
mouth
and
eyes
the
effect
is
appalling
these
are
the
men
whose
faces
have
been
burned
by
at
antwerp
the
commandant
asked
me
to
come
with
him
through
the
wards
and
find
all
the
british
wounded
who
are
well
enough
to
be
sent
home
i
am
to
take
their
names
and
dress
them
and
get
them
ready
to
go
by
the
morning
train
there
are
none
in
the
upper
wards
can
not
be
moved
he
is
very
ill
they
do
not
think
he
will
live
there
are
three
downstairs
in
the
hall
one
is
well
enough
to
look
after
himself
i
have
forgotten
his
name
one
russell
is
wounded
in
the
knee
the
third
cameron
a
big
highlander
is
wounded
in
the
head
he
wears
a
high
headdress
of
bandages
wound
round
and
round
many
times
like
an
indian
turban
and
secured
by
more
bandages
round
his
jaw
and
chin
it
is
glued
tight
to
one
side
of
his
head
with
clotted
blood
between
the
bandages
his
sharp
highland
face
looks
piteous
i
am
to
dress
these
two
and
have
them
ready
by
eleven
of
the
british
field
hospital
who
is
to
take
them
over
comes
round
to
enter
their
names
on
his
list
they
are
to
be
dressed
in
civilian
clothes
supplied
by
the
hospital
it
all
sounded
very
simple
until
you
tried
to
get
the
clothes
first
you
had
to
see
the
president
who
referred
you
to
the
matron
who
referred
you
to
the
clerk
in
charge
of
the
clothing
department
an
one
of
the
mysterious
officials
who
hang
about
the
hall
wearing
peaked
caps
the
problem
of
their
existence
was
now
solved
for
the
first
time
an
was
despatched
to
find
the
clerk
the
clothing
department
must
have
been
hidden
in
the
remotest
recesses
of
the
hospital
for
it
was
ages
before
he
came
back
to
ask
me
all
over
again
what
clothes
would
be
wanted
he
was
a
little
fat
man
with
bright
curly
hair
very
eager
and
very
cheerful
and
very
kind
he
scuttled
off
again
like
a
rabbit
and
i
had
to
call
him
back
to
measure
russell
and
when
he
had
measured
russell
with
his
gay
and
amiable
alacrity
russell
and
i
had
to
wait
until
he
came
back
with
the
clothes
i
had
made
up
my
mind
very
soon
that
it
would
be
no
use
measuring
cameron
for
any
clothes
or
getting
him
ready
for
any
train
he
was
moving
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
making
queer
moaning
sounds
of
agitation
and
dismay
he
had
asked
for
a
cigarette
which
somebody
had
brought
him
it
dropped
from
his
fingers
somebody
picked
it
up
and
lit
it
and
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
it
dropped
again
then
i
noticed
something
odd
about
his
left
arm
he
was
holding
it
up
with
his
right
hand
and
feeling
it
it
dropped
too
like
a
dead
weight
on
the
counterpane
cameron
watched
its
behaviour
with
anguish
he
complained
that
his
left
arm
was
all
numb
and
too
heavy
to
hold
up
also
he
said
he
was
afraid
to
be
moved
and
taken
away
it
struck
me
that
cameron
head
must
be
smashed
in
on
the
right
side
and
that
some
pressure
on
his
brain
was
causing
paralysis
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
could
be
moved
so
i
sent
for
one
of
the
belgian
doctors
to
come
and
look
at
him
and
keep
him
in
the
hospital
the
belgian
doctor
found
that
cameron
head
smashed
in
on
the
right
side
and
that
there
was
pressure
on
his
brain
causing
paralysis
in
his
left
arm
he
is
to
be
kept
in
the
hospital
and
operated
on
this
morning
they
may
save
him
if
they
can
remove
the
pressure
it
seemed
ages
before
the
merry
little
came
back
with
russell
clothes
and
when
he
did
come
he
brought
socks
that
were
too
tight
and
went
back
and
brought
socks
that
were
too
large
and
a
shirt
that
was
too
tight
and
trousers
that
were
too
long
then
he
went
back
eager
as
ever
and
brought
drawers
that
were
too
tight
and
more
trousers
that
were
too
short
he
brought
boots
that
were
too
large
and
boots
that
were
too
tight
and
he
had
to
be
sent
back
again
for
slippers
last
of
all
he
brought
a
shirt
which
made
russell
smile
and
mutter
something
about
being
dressed
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
a
black
cutaway
morning
coat
and
a
variety
of
hats
all
too
small
for
russell
then
when
you
had
made
a
selection
you
began
to
try
to
get
russell
into
all
these
things
that
were
too
tight
or
too
loose
for
him
the
socks
were
the
worst
the
one
had
to
be
put
on
very
carefully
by
quarter
inches
at
a
time
the
least
tug
on
the
sock
would
give
russell
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
wounded
knee
and
russell
was
all
for
violence
and
haste
he
was
so
afraid
of
being
left
behind
though
he
called
me
sister
i
felt
certain
that
russell
must
know
that
i
was
a
trained
nurse
and
that
he
was
the
first
wounded
man
i
had
ever
dressed
in
my
life
however
i
did
get
him
dressed
somehow
with
the
help
of
the
little
and
a
wonderful
sight
he
was
in
the
costume
of
a
belgian
civilian
what
tried
him
most
were
the
hats
he
refused
a
peaked
cap
which
the
pressed
on
him
and
compromised
finally
on
a
sort
of
checked
cricket
cap
that
just
covered
the
extreme
top
of
his
head
we
got
him
off
in
time
after
all
then
two
came
with
a
stretcher
and
carried
cameron
upstairs
to
the
operating
theatre
and
i
went
up
and
waited
with
him
in
the
corridor
till
the
surgeons
were
ready
for
him
he
had
grown
drowsy
and
indifferent
by
now
i
have
missed
the
ambulance
going
out
to
lokeren
and
have
had
to
stay
behind
two
ladies
called
to
see
one
of
them
was
miss
who
had
him
in
her
ward
at
antwerp
i
took
them
over
the
hospital
to
find
his
room
which
is
on
the
second
story
his
name
his
names
in
thick
gothic
letters
were
on
a
white
card
by
the
door
he
was
asleep
and
the
nurse
could
not
let
them
see
him
miss
and
her
friend
are
staying
in
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
where
the
british
field
hospital
has
taken
some
of
its
wounded
towards
one
news
came
of
heavy
fighting
the
battle
is
creeping
nearer
to
us
it
has
stretched
from
zele
and
quatrecht
to
melle
four
and
a
half
miles
from
ghent
they
are
saying
that
the
germans
may
enter
ghent
in
an
hour
half
an
hour
it
will
be
very
awkward
for
us
and
for
our
wounded
if
they
do
as
both
our
ambulance
cars
are
out
later
news
of
more
fighting
at
quatrecht
the
commandant
has
come
back
they
were
at
quatrecht
not
lokeren
is
awake
now
the
commandant
has
taken
me
to
see
him
he
is
lying
in
one
of
the
officers
wards
a
small
room
with
bare
walls
and
a
blond
light
looking
south
there
are
two
beds
in
this
room
set
side
by
side
in
the
one
next
the
door
there
is
a
young
french
officer
he
is
very
young
a
boy
with
sleek
black
hair
and
smooth
skin
shining
and
fresh
as
if
he
had
never
been
near
the
smoke
and
dirt
of
battle
he
is
sitting
up
reading
a
french
magazine
he
is
wounded
in
the
leg
his
crutches
are
propped
up
against
the
wall
stretched
on
his
back
in
the
further
bed
there
is
a
very
tall
young
englishman
the
sheet
is
drawn
very
tight
over
his
chest
his
face
is
flushed
and
he
is
breathing
rapidly
in
short
jerks
at
first
you
do
not
see
that
he
too
is
not
more
than
a
boy
for
he
is
so
big
and
tall
and
a
little
brown
feathery
beard
has
begun
to
curl
about
his
jaw
and
chin
when
i
came
to
him
and
the
commandant
told
him
my
name
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
with
a
look
of
startled
recognition
he
said
he
knew
me
he
had
seen
me
somewhere
in
england
he
was
so
certain
about
it
that
he
persuaded
me
that
i
had
seen
him
somewhere
but
we
can
neither
of
us
remember
where
or
when
they
say
he
is
not
perfectly
conscious
all
the
time
we
stayed
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
till
he
went
off
to
sleep
again
none
of
the
doctors
think
that
he
can
live
he
was
wounded
in
front
with
mitrailleuse
eight
bullets
in
his
body
he
has
been
operated
on
how
he
survived
the
operation
and
the
journey
on
the
top
of
it
i
ca
imagine
and
now
general
peritonitis
has
set
in
it
does
look
as
if
he
had
a
chance
we
have
heard
that
all
the
war
correspondents
have
been
sent
out
of
ghent
numbers
of
british
troops
came
in
went
up
to
see
foster
who
is
in
his
room
ill
it
is
hard
lines
that
he
should
have
had
this
accident
when
he
has
been
working
so
splendidly
and
it
was
his
fault
either
one
of
the
belgian
bearers
slipped
with
his
end
of
a
stretcher
when
they
were
carrying
a
heavy
man
and
foster
got
hurt
in
trying
to
right
the
balance
and
save
his
wounded
man
he
is
very
much
distressed
at
having
to
lie
up
and
be
waited
on
impossible
to
write
a
journal
or
any
articles
while
i
am
in
the
hospital
and
there
is
no
table
yet
in
my
room
at
the
hôtel
cecil
the
first
ambulance
car
with
the
chauffeur
bert
and
riley
has
come
back
from
melle
where
they
left
torrence
and
janet
and
wilson
they
went
back
again
in
the
afternoon
they
are
all
out
now
except
poor
foster
and
lambert
who
is
somewhere
with
her
husband
i
am
the
only
available
member
of
the
corps
left
in
the
hospital
no
germans
have
appeared
yet
i
was
sitting
up
in
the
making
entries
in
the
when
i
was
sent
for
somebody
or
something
had
arrived
and
was
waiting
below
on
the
steps
of
the
hospital
i
found
two
british
chauffeurs
in
suits
of
khaki
behind
them
drawn
up
in
the
entry
were
two
daimler
cars
i
thought
it
was
a
field
ambulance
that
had
lost
itself
on
the
way
to
france
the
chauffeurs
they
had
beautiful
manners
and
were
very
spick
and
span
and
one
pleased
me
by
his
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
editor
of
the
the
chauffeurs
wanted
to
know
whether
they
had
come
to
the
right
place
and
of
course
they
hardly
had
if
all
the
british
red
cross
ambulance
cars
were
going
into
france
then
they
explained
they
were
certainly
making
for
ghent
the
british
red
cross
society
had
sent
them
there
they
were
only
anxious
to
know
whether
they
had
come
to
the
right
hospital
the
hospital
where
the
english
field
ambulance
was
quartered
yes
that
was
right
they
had
been
sent
for
us
they
had
just
come
up
from
ostend
and
they
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
ghent
before
orders
came
through
for
an
ambulance
to
be
sent
at
once
to
melle
the
only
available
member
of
the
corps
was
its
secretary
and
reporter
to
that
utterly
untrained
and
supremely
inappropriate
person
heaven
sent
this
incredible
luck
when
i
think
how
easily
i
might
have
missed
it
if
i
gone
for
a
stroll
in
the
town
if
i
sat
five
minutes
longer
with
foster
if
the
landlord
of
the
hôtel
cecil
had
kept
his
word
and
given
me
a
table
when
i
should
to
a
dead
certainty
have
been
writing
this
wretched
journal
at
the
ineffable
moment
when
the
chauffeurs
arrived
i
am
glad
to
think
that
i
had
just
enough
morality
left
to
play
fair
with
lambert
i
did
try
to
find
her
so
that
she
should
miss
it
somebody
said
she
was
in
one
of
the
restaurants
on
the
with
her
husband
i
looked
in
all
the
restaurants
and
she
was
in
one
of
them
the
finger
of
heaven
pointed
unmistakably
to
the
secretary
and
reporter
there
was
a
delay
of
ten
minutes
no
more
while
i
got
some
cake
and
sandwiches
for
the
hungry
chauffeurs
and
took
them
to
the
bureau
to
have
their
brassards
stamped
and
in
every
minute
of
the
ten
i
suffered
tortures
while
we
waited
i
thought
something
happen
to
prevent
my
taking
that
ambulance
car
out
i
thought
my
heart
would
leave
off
beating
and
i
should
die
before
we
started
i
believe
people
feel
like
this
sometimes
before
their
wedding
night
i
thought
the
commandant
would
come
back
and
send
out
ursula
dearmer
instead
i
thought
the
military
power
would
come
down
from
its
secret
and
stop
me
but
none
of
these
things
happened
at
the
last
moment
i
thought
that
c
c
was
the
belgian
red
cross
guide
who
took
us
into
antwerp
to
c
i
said
simply
and
firmly
that
i
was
going
the
functions
of
the
secretary
and
reporter
had
never
been
very
clearly
defined
and
this
was
certainly
not
the
moment
to
define
them
c
in
his
innocence
accepted
me
with
confidence
and
a
chivalrous
gravity
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
the
chauffeur
newlands
the
leaner
and
darker
one
declared
himself
ready
for
anything
all
he
wanted
was
to
get
to
work
poor
ascot
who
was
so
like
my
friend
the
editor
had
to
be
content
with
his
vigil
in
the
back
yard
at
last
we
got
off
i
might
have
trusted
heaven
the
getting
off
was
a
foregone
conclusion
for
we
went
along
the
road
which
had
not
worked
its
mysterious
fascination
for
nothing
at
a
fork
where
two
roads
go
into
ghent
we
saw
one
of
our
old
ambulance
cars
dashing
into
ghent
down
the
other
road
on
our
left
it
was
beyond
hail
heaven
us
to
go
on
uninterrupted
and
unchallenged
i
had
not
allowed
for
trouble
at
the
barrier
there
always
is
a
barrier
which
may
be
anything
from
a
mile
to
four
miles
from
the
field
or
village
where
the
wounded
are
yesterday
on
the
way
to
lokeren
the
barrier
was
at
z
it
was
somewhere
between
ghent
and
melle
none
of
us
had
ever
quite
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
trouble
at
the
barrier
we
know
that
the
belgian
authorities
wisely
refused
all
responsibility
properly
speaking
our
ambulances
were
not
supposed
to
go
nearer
than
a
certain
safe
distance
from
the
enemy
for
two
reasons
first
it
stood
the
chance
of
being
shelled
or
taken
prisoner
second
there
was
a
very
natural
fear
that
it
might
draw
down
the
enemy
fire
on
the
belgians
our
huge
lumbering
cars
with
their
khaki
hoods
and
flaming
red
crosses
on
a
white
ground
were
an
admirable
mark
for
german
guns
but
as
the
corps
in
this
case
went
into
the
on
foot
i
do
not
think
that
the
risk
was
to
the
belgians
so
though
in
theory
we
stopped
outside
the
barriers
in
practice
we
invariably
got
through
the
new
car
was
stopped
at
the
barrier
now
by
the
usual
belgian
army
medical
officer
we
were
not
to
go
on
to
melle
i
said
that
we
had
orders
to
go
on
to
melle
and
i
meant
to
go
on
to
melle
the
medical
officer
said
again
that
we
were
not
to
go
and
i
said
again
that
we
were
going
then
that
belgian
army
medical
officer
began
to
tell
us
what
i
imagine
is
the
usual
barrier
tale
there
were
any
amount
of
ambulances
at
melle
there
were
no
wounded
at
melle
and
in
any
case
this
ambulance
would
be
allowed
to
go
there
and
then
the
usual
battle
of
the
barrier
had
place
it
was
one
against
three
for
c
went
over
to
the
enemy
and
the
chauffeur
newlands
confronted
by
two
official
adversaries
in
uniform
became
deafer
and
deafer
to
my
voice
in
his
right
ear
first
the
noble
and
chivalrous
belgian
red
cross
guide
with
an
appalling
treachery
gave
the
order
to
turn
the
car
round
to
ghent
i
gave
the
counter
order
newlands
wavered
for
one
heroic
moment
then
he
turned
the
car
round
i
jumped
out
and
went
up
to
the
army
medical
officer
and
delivered
a
frontal
attack
discharging
execrable
french
no
wounded
you
tell
us
that
tale
every
day
and
there
are
always
wounded
do
you
want
any
more
of
them
to
die
i
mean
to
go
on
and
i
shall
go
on
i
did
ask
him
how
he
thought
he
could
stop
one
whom
heaven
had
predestined
to
go
on
to
melle
c
had
got
out
now
to
see
the
fight
the
army
medical
officer
looked
the
secretary
and
reporter
up
and
down
taking
in
that
vision
of
inappropriateness
and
disproportion
there
was
a
faint
a
very
faint
smile
under
the
ferocity
of
his
moustache
the
first
sign
of
relenting
the
secretary
and
reporter
saw
the
advantage
and
followed
as
you
might
follow
a
bend
in
the
enemy
line
of
defence
i
to
go
on
placably
almost
pathetically
veux
do
you
by
any
chance
imagine
we
at
this
c
the
belgian
guide
smiled
too
under
a
moustache
not
quite
so
ferocious
as
the
army
medical
officer
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
they
had
done
their
duty
anyhow
they
had
lost
the
battle
the
guide
and
the
reporter
jumped
back
into
the
car
i
did
hear
anybody
give
the
order
but
the
chauffeur
newlands
turned
her
round
in
no
time
and
we
dashed
past
the
barrier
and
into
melle
the
village
street
that
had
been
raked
by
mitrailleuses
from
the
field
beyond
it
was
quiet
when
we
came
in
and
almost
deserted
up
a
side
street
propped
against
the
wall
of
a
stable
four
wounded
frenchmen
waited
for
the
ambulance
a
fifth
shot
through
the
back
of
his
head
by
a
bullet
lay
in
front
of
them
on
a
stretcher
that
dripped
blood
i
found
grierson
in
the
village
left
behind
by
the
last
ambulance
he
was
immensely
astonished
at
my
arrival
with
the
new
car
he
had
with
him
an
eager
little
englishman
one
of
the
sort
that
tracks
an
ambulance
everywhere
on
the
of
being
useful
and
the
curé
of
the
village
was
there
he
wore
the
red
cross
brassard
on
the
sleeve
of
his
cassock
and
he
carried
the
host
in
a
little
bag
of
purple
silk
they
told
me
that
the
village
had
been
fired
on
by
shrapnel
a
few
minutes
before
we
came
into
it
they
said
we
were
only
a
hundred
yards
from
the
german
trenches
we
could
see
the
edge
of
the
field
from
the
village
street
the
trenches
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
it
was
baerlaere
all
over
again
the
firing
stopped
as
soon
as
i
came
within
range
of
it
and
did
begin
again
until
we
had
got
away
you
could
take
any
interest
in
the
firing
or
the
german
trenches
or
the
eager
little
englishman
or
anything
you
could
see
anything
but
those
five
wounded
men
or
think
of
anything
but
how
to
get
them
into
the
ambulance
as
painlessly
and
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
the
man
on
the
dripping
stretcher
was
mortally
wounded
he
was
lifted
in
first
very
slowly
and
gently
the
curé
climbed
in
after
him
carrying
the
host
he
kneeled
there
while
the
blood
from
the
wounded
head
oozed
through
the
bandages
and
through
the
canvas
of
the
stretcher
to
the
floor
and
to
the
skirts
of
his
cassock
we
waited
there
was
no
ugly
haste
in
the
supreme
act
the
three
mortal
moments
that
it
lasted
it
could
not
have
lasted
more
were
charged
with
immortality
while
the
curé
remained
kneeling
in
the
pool
of
blood
i
shall
never
become
a
catholic
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
because
of
the
curé
of
melle
who
turned
our
new
motor
ambulance
into
a
sanctuary
after
the
french
soldier
had
baptized
it
with
his
blood
i
have
never
seen
i
never
shall
see
anything
more
beautiful
more
gracious
than
the
soul
that
appeared
in
his
lean
dark
face
and
in
the
straight
slender
body
under
the
black
in
his
simple
inevitable
gestures
you
saw
adoration
of
god
contempt
for
death
and
uttermost
compassion
it
was
all
over
i
received
his
missal
and
his
bag
of
purple
silk
as
he
gathered
his
cassock
about
him
and
came
down
i
asked
him
if
anything
could
be
done
his
eyes
smiled
as
he
answered
but
his
lips
quivered
as
he
took
again
his
missal
and
his
purple
bag
c
is
now
glad
that
we
went
on
to
melle
we
helped
the
four
other
wounded
men
in
they
sat
in
a
row
alongside
the
stretcher
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
ambulance
at
the
feet
of
the
dying
man
by
the
handles
of
the
stretcher
at
the
last
minute
the
chaplain
jumped
on
to
the
step
so
did
the
little
eager
englishman
hanging
on
to
the
hood
and
swaying
with
the
rush
of
the
car
he
talked
continually
he
talked
from
the
moment
we
left
melle
to
the
moment
when
we
landed
him
at
his
street
in
ghent
explaining
over
and
over
again
the
qualifications
that
justified
him
in
attaching
himself
to
ambulances
he
had
lived
fourteen
years
in
ghent
he
could
speak
french
and
flemish
i
longed
for
the
eager
little
englishman
to
stop
i
longed
for
his
street
to
come
and
swallow
him
up
he
had
lived
in
ghent
fourteen
years
he
could
speak
flemish
and
french
i
felt
that
i
could
bear
it
if
he
went
on
a
minute
longer
i
wanted
to
think
the
dying
man
lay
close
behind
me
very
straight
and
stiff
his
poor
feet
stuck
out
close
under
my
hand
but
i
could
think
the
little
eager
englishman
went
on
swaying
and
talking
he
had
lived
fourteen
years
in
ghent
he
could
speak
french
and
flemish
the
dying
man
was
still
alive
when
he
was
lifted
out
of
the
ambulance
he
died
that
evening
the
commandant
is
pleased
with
his
new
ambulances
he
is
not
altogether
displeased
with
me
we
must
have
been
very
quick
for
it
was
the
commandant
car
that
we
passed
at
the
fork
of
the
road
and
either
he
arrived
a
few
minutes
after
we
got
back
or
we
arrived
just
as
he
had
got
in
anyhow
we
met
in
the
porch
he
and
ursula
dearmer
and
i
went
back
to
melle
again
at
once
in
the
new
car
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
got
there
we
found
torrence
and
little
janet
in
the
village
they
and
wilson
had
been
working
all
day
long
picking
up
wounded
off
the
field
outside
it
the
german
lines
are
not
far
off
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
i
think
only
a
small
number
of
their
guns
could
rake
the
main
street
of
the
village
where
we
were
their
shell
went
over
our
heads
and
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
towards
the
french
batteries
on
this
side
of
the
village
there
must
have
been
a
rush
from
the
german
lines
across
this
field
and
the
french
batteries
have
done
their
work
well
for
torrence
said
the
german
dead
are
lying
thick
there
among
the
turnips
she
and
janet
and
wilson
had
been
under
fire
for
eight
hours
on
end
lifting
men
and
carrying
stretchers
i
do
know
whether
their
figures
the
two
girls
in
khaki
tunics
and
breeches
could
be
seen
from
the
german
lines
but
they
just
trudged
on
between
the
furrows
and
over
the
serenely
regardless
of
the
enemy
carefully
sorting
the
wounded
from
the
dead
with
the
bullets
whizzing
past
their
noses
of
bullets
torrence
said
indeed
that
eight
hours
of
them
were
rather
more
than
she
cared
for
and
of
carrying
stretchers
over
a
that
it
was
as
much
as
she
and
janet
could
do
but
they
came
back
from
it
without
turning
a
hair
i
have
seen
women
more
dishevelled
after
tramping
a
in
a
day
they
went
off
somewhere
to
find
wilson
and
we
ursula
dearmer
the
commandant
and
i
hung
about
the
village
waiting
for
the
wounded
to
be
brought
in
the
village
was
crowded
with
french
and
belgian
troops
when
we
came
into
it
then
they
gathered
together
and
went
on
towards
the
field
and
we
followed
them
up
the
street
they
called
to
us
to
stay
under
cover
or
if
we
walk
up
the
street
to
keep
close
under
the
houses
as
the
bullets
might
come
flying
at
us
any
minute
no
bullets
came
however
it
was
like
baerlaere
it
was
like
lokeren
it
was
like
every
place
i
been
in
so
far
nothing
came
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
of
its
getting
me
after
that
we
drove
down
to
the
station
while
we
were
hanging
about
there
a
shell
was
hurled
over
this
side
of
the
village
from
the
german
batteries
it
careered
over
the
roofs
with
a
track
that
was
luminous
in
the
dusk
like
a
curved
sheet
of
lightning
i
do
know
where
it
fell
and
burst
we
were
told
to
stand
out
from
under
the
station
building
for
fear
it
should
be
struck
when
we
got
back
into
the
village
we
went
into
the
inn
and
waited
there
in
a
long
narrow
room
lit
by
a
few
small
and
crammed
with
soldiers
they
were
eating
and
drinking
in
vehement
haste
wherever
the
light
from
the
lamps
fell
on
them
you
saw
faces
flushed
and
scarred
under
a
blur
of
smoke
and
grime
here
and
there
a
bandage
showed
up
violently
white
on
the
tables
enormous
quantities
of
bread
appeared
and
disappeared
these
soldiers
with
all
their
vehemence
and
violence
were
exceedingly
lovable
one
man
brought
me
a
chair
another
brought
bread
and
offered
it
charming
smiles
flashed
through
the
grime
at
last
when
we
had
found
one
man
with
a
wounded
hand
we
got
into
the
ambulance
and
went
back
to
ghent
i
have
got
something
to
do
again
at
last
i
am
to
help
to
look
after
he
has
the
pick
of
the
belgian
red
cross
women
to
nurse
him
and
they
are
angelically
kind
and
very
skilful
but
he
is
not
very
happy
with
them
he
says
these
dear
people
are
so
good
to
me
but
i
ca
make
out
what
they
say
i
ca
tell
them
what
i
want
he
is
pathetically
glad
to
have
any
english
people
with
him
even
i
am
a
little
better
than
a
belgian
whom
he
can
not
understand
i
sat
with
him
all
morning
the
french
boy
has
gone
and
he
is
alone
in
his
room
now
it
seems
that
the
kind
chaplain
sat
up
with
him
all
last
night
after
his
hard
day
at
melle
i
wish
now
i
had
stood
by
the
chaplain
with
his
matins
he
has
never
tried
to
have
them
again
given
us
up
as
an
unholy
crew
all
except
foster
whom
he
clings
to
the
morning
went
like
half
an
hour
while
it
was
going
but
when
it
was
over
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
nursing
for
weeks
on
end
there
were
so
many
little
things
to
be
done
and
so
much
that
you
must
do
and
the
anxiety
was
appalling
i
do
suppose
there
is
a
worse
case
in
the
hospital
he
is
perhaps
a
shade
better
but
none
of
the
medical
staff
think
that
he
can
live
madame
e
and
bird
have
shown
me
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
i
must
keep
him
all
the
time
in
the
same
position
i
must
give
him
sips
of
iced
broth
and
little
pieces
of
ice
to
suck
every
now
and
then
i
must
not
let
him
try
to
raise
himself
in
bed
i
must
not
try
to
lift
him
myself
if
we
do
lift
him
we
must
keep
his
body
tilted
at
the
same
angle
i
must
not
give
him
any
hot
drinks
and
not
too
much
cold
drink
and
he
is
six
foot
high
so
tall
that
his
feet
come
through
the
blankets
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
he
keeps
sinking
down
in
it
all
the
time
and
wanting
to
raise
himself
up
again
and
his
fever
makes
him
restless
and
he
is
always
thirsty
and
he
longs
for
hot
tea
more
than
iced
water
and
for
more
iced
water
than
is
good
for
him
the
iced
broth
that
is
his
only
nourishment
he
does
not
want
at
all
and
then
he
must
be
kept
very
quiet
i
must
not
let
him
talk
more
than
is
necessary
to
tell
me
what
he
wants
or
he
will
die
of
exhaustion
and
what
he
wants
is
to
talk
every
minute
that
he
is
awake
he
drops
off
to
sleep
breathing
in
jerks
and
with
a
terrible
rapidity
and
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
as
long
as
he
sleeps
but
his
sleep
only
lasts
for
a
few
minutes
i
hear
the
rhythm
of
his
breathing
alter
it
slackens
and
goes
slow
then
it
jerks
again
and
i
know
that
he
is
awake
and
then
he
begins
he
says
things
that
tear
at
your
heart
he
has
looks
and
gestures
that
break
it
the
adorable
wilful
smile
of
a
child
that
knows
that
it
is
being
watched
when
you
find
his
hand
groping
too
often
for
the
glass
of
iced
water
that
stands
beside
his
bed
a
still
more
adorable
and
utterly
gentle
submission
when
you
take
the
glass
from
him
when
you
tell
him
not
to
say
anything
more
just
yet
but
to
go
to
sleep
again
you
feel
as
if
you
were
guilty
of
act
after
act
of
nameless
and
abominable
cruelty
he
sticks
to
it
that
he
has
seen
me
before
that
he
has
heard
of
me
that
his
people
know
me
and
he
wants
to
know
what
i
do
and
where
i
live
and
where
it
was
that
he
saw
me
once
when
i
thought
he
had
gone
to
sleep
i
heard
him
begin
again
where
did
you
say
you
lived
i
tell
him
and
i
tell
him
to
go
to
sleep
again
he
closes
his
eyes
obediently
and
opens
them
the
next
instant
i
say
may
i
come
and
call
on
you
when
we
get
back
to
england
you
can
only
say
yes
of
course
and
tell
him
to
go
to
sleep
his
voice
is
so
strong
and
clear
that
i
could
almost
believe
that
he
will
get
back
and
that
some
day
i
shall
look
up
and
see
him
standing
at
my
garden
gate
mercifully
when
i
tell
him
to
go
to
sleep
again
he
does
go
to
sleep
and
his
voice
is
a
little
clearer
and
stronger
every
time
he
wakes
and
so
the
morning
goes
on
the
only
thing
he
wants
you
to
do
for
him
is
to
sponge
his
hands
and
face
with
iced
water
and
to
give
him
little
bits
of
ice
to
suck
over
and
over
again
i
do
these
things
and
over
and
over
again
he
asks
me
do
you
mind
he
wears
a
little
grey
woollen
cord
round
his
neck
something
has
gone
from
it
whatever
he
has
lost
they
have
left
him
his
little
woollen
cord
as
if
some
immense
importance
attached
to
it
he
has
fallen
into
a
long
doze
and
at
the
end
of
the
morning
i
left
him
sleeping
some
of
the
corps
have
brought
in
trophies
from
the
a
fine
grey
cloak
with
a
scarlet
collar
a
spiked
helmet
a
cuff
with
three
buttons
cut
from
the
coat
of
a
dead
german
these
things
make
me
sick
i
see
the
body
under
the
cloak
the
head
under
the
helmet
and
the
dead
hand
under
the
cuff
saw
foster
he
is
to
be
sent
back
to
england
for
an
operation
wilson
is
to
take
him
he
asked
me
if
i
thought
the
commandant
would
take
him
back
again
when
he
is
better
saw
the
president
about
foster
he
will
not
hear
of
his
going
back
to
england
he
wants
him
to
stay
in
the
hospital
and
be
operated
on
here
he
promises
the
utmost
care
and
attention
he
is
most
distressed
to
think
that
he
should
go
it
does
occur
to
him
in
his
kindness
that
it
would
be
much
more
distressing
if
the
germans
came
into
ghent
and
interrupted
the
operation

he

back
to

to

again
and
to
repair
the

that
broke
down
at
lokeren
somebody
else
is
to
look
after
this
afternoon
i
have
been
given
leave
rather
reluctantly
to
sit
up
with
him
at
night
the
commandant
is
going
to
take
me
in
tom
daimler
car
to
the
british
lines
to
look
for
a
base
for
that
temporary
hospital
which
is
still
running
in
his
head
like
a
splendid
dream
i
do
not
see
how
with
the
germans
at
melle
only
four
and
a
half
miles
off
any
sort
of
hospital
is
to
be
established
on
this
side
of
ghent
tom
the
chauffeur
does
not
look
with
favour
on
the
expedition
i
have
had
to
point
out
to
him
that
a
field
ambulance
is
as
he
would
say
the
house
of
commons
and
that
there
is
a
certain
propriety
binding
even
on
a
chauffeur
and
a
limit
to
the
freedom
of
the
speech
you
may
apply
to
your
commandant
this
afternoon
tom
has
exceeded
all
the
limits
the
worst
of
tom
is
that
while
his
tongue
rages
on
the
confines
of
revolt
he
himself
is
punctilious
to
excess
on
the
point
of
orders
either
he
has
orders
or
he
has
them
if
he
has
them
he
obeys
them
with
a
punctuality
that
puts
everybody
else
in
the
wrong
if
he
them
an
earthquake
would
make
him
move
such
is
his
devotion
to
orders
that
he
will
insist
on
any
one
order
holding
good
for
an
unlimited
time
after
it
has
been
given
so
now
in
defence
of
his
manners
he
urges
that
what
with
orders
and
the
provocation
is
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
stand
tom
himself
is
protest
clothed
in
flesh
and
blood
at
two
tom
orders
are
that
his
car
is
to
be
ready
at
my
orders
are
to
be
ready
in
twenty
minutes
i
ready
in
twenty
minutes
the
commandant
thinks
that
he
has
transacted
all
his
business
and
is
ready
in
twenty
minutes
too
tom
and
his
car
are
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
go
to
look
for
tom
tom
is
reported
as
being
last
seen
riding
on
a
towards
the
british
lines
in
the
company
of
a
detachment
of
british
infantry
the
chauffeur
tom
is
considered
to
have
disgraced
himself
everlastingly
punctually
at
he
appears
with
his
car
at
the
door
of
the
flandria
the
commandant
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
has
gone
to
look
for
tom
i
reprove
tom
for
the
sin
of
unpunctuality
and
he
has
me
his
orders
were
to
be
ready
at
and
he
is
ready
at
and
it
is
nobody
business
what
he
did
with
himself
ten
minutes
before
he
wants
to
know
where
the
commandant
is
i
go
to
look
for
the
commandant
the
commandant
is
reported
to
have
been
last
seen
going
through
the
hospital
on
his
way
to
the
garage
i
go
round
to
the
garage
through
the
hospital
and
the
commandant
goes
out
of
the
garage
by
the
street
he
was
last
seen
the
garage
he
appears
suddenly
from
some
quarter
where
you
would
expect
him
in
the
least
he
reproves
tom
tom
with
considerable
violence
declares
his
righteousness
he
has
gathered
to
himself
a
friend
a
belgian
red
cross
man
whose
language
he
does
not
understand
but
they
exchange
winks
that
surpass
all
language
then
the
commandant
remembers
that
he
has
several
cables
to
send
off
he
is
seen
disappearing
in
the
direction
of
the
post
and
telegraph
office
tom
swallows
words
that
would
be
curses
if
i
were
not
there
i
keep
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
doors
of
the
post
office
ages
pass
i
go
to
the
post
office
to
look
for
the
commandant
he
is
not
in
the
telegraph
office
he
is
not
in
the
post
office
tom
keeps
his
eyes
on
the
doors
of
both
more
ages
pass
finally
the
commandant
appears
from
inside
the
hospital
which
he
has
not
been
seen
to
enter
the
chauffeur
tom
dismounts
and
draws
from
his
car
mysterious
being
sounds
that
express
the
savage
fury
of
his
resentment
you
would
think
we
were
off
now
but
we
only
get
as
far
as
a
street
somewhere
near
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
here
we
wait
for
apparently
no
reason
in
such
tension
that
you
can
hear
the
ages
pass
the
commandant
disappears
tom
says
something
about
there
being
no
room
for
the
wounded
at
this
rate
it
seems
his
orders
are
to
go
first
to
the
british
lines
at
a
place
whose
name
i
forget
and
then
on
to
melle
i
remember
tom
views
on
the
subject
of
and
suddenly
i
seem
to
understand
them
tom
is
very
like
lord
kitchener
he
knows
nothing
about
the
aims
and
wants
of
modern
womanhood
and
he
cares
less
the
modern
woman
does
not
ask
to
be
protected
does
not
want
to
be
protected
and
tom
like
lord
kitchener
will
go
on
protecting
you
can
not
elevate
men
like
lord
kitchener
and
tom
above
the
primitive
plane
of
chivalry
tom
in
the
danger
zone
with
a
woman
by
his
side
feels
about
as
peaceful
and
comfortable
as
a
woman
in
the
danger
zone
with
a
baby
in
her
lap
a
bomb
in
his
bedroom
is
one
thing
and
a
band
of
drunken
uhlans
making
for
his
women
is
another
tom
nerves
are
racked
with
problems
how
the
dickens
is
he
to
steer
his
car
and
protect
his
women
at
the
same
time
and
if
it
comes
to
a
between
his
women
and
his
wounded
you
got
to
stow
the
silly
things
somewhere
and
every
one
of
them
takes
up
the
place
of
a
wounded
man
i
get
out
of
the
car
and
tell
the
commandant
that
i
would
rather
not
go
than
take
up
the
place
of
a
wounded
man
he
orders
me
back
to
the
car
again
tom
seems
inclined
to
regard
me
as
a
woman
who
has
done
her
best
we
go
on
a
little
way
and
stop
again
and
there
springs
out
of
the
pavement
a
curious
figure
that
i
have
seen
somewhere
before
in
ghent
i
can
not
remember
when
or
where
the
figure
wears
a
check
suit
of
extreme
horsyness
and
carries
a
kodak
in
its
hand
it
is
excited
there
is
something
about
it
that
reminds
me
now
of
the
eager
little
englishman
at
melle
these
figures
spring
up
everywhere
in
the
track
of
a
field
ambulance
when
tom
sees
it
he
groans
in
despair
the
commandant
gets
out
and
appears
to
be
offering
it
the
hospitality
of
the
car
i
am
introduced
to
my
horror
the
figure
skips
round
in
front
of
the
car
levels
its
kodak
at
my
head
and
implores
me
to
sit
still
i
am
very
rude
i
tell
it
sternly
to
take
that
beastly
thing
away
and
go
away
itself
it
goes
rather
startled
and
we
get
off
somehow
without
it
and
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
street
here
tom
has
orders
to
stop
at
the
first
he
comes
to
the
commandant
has
lost
his
hat
at
melle
he
has
been
wearing
little
janet
arctic
cap
to
the
delight
of
everybody
he
has
just
remembered
that
he
wants
a
hat
and
he
thinks
that
he
will
get
it
now
at
this
point
i
break
down
i
hear
myself
say
damn
five
times
softly
but
distinctly
this
after
reproving
tom
for
unfettered
speech
and
potential
insubordination
tom
stops
at
a
the
commandant
to
his
doom
enters
and
presently
returns
wearing
a
soft
felt
hat
of
a
vivid
green
he
asks
me
what
i
think
of
it
i
tell
him
all
i
think
of
it
and
he
says
that
if
i
feel
like
that
about
it
he
go
in
again
and
get
another
one
i
forget
what
i
said
then
except
that
i
wanted
to
get
on
to
melle
that
melle
was
the
place
of
all
places
where
i
most
wished
to
be
then
lest
he
might
feel
unhappy
in
his
green
hat
i
said
that
if
he
would
leave
it
out
all
night
in
the
rain
and
then
sit
on
it
no
doubt
time
and
weather
and
god
would
do
something
for
it
this
time
we
were
off
and
when
i
realized
it
i
said
hurray
tom
had
not
said
anything
for
some
considerable
time
we
found
the
british
lines
in
a
little
village
just
outside
of
ghent
no
place
there
for
a
base
hospital
we
hung
about
here
for
twenty
minutes
and
the
women
and
children
came
out
to
stare
at
us
with
innocent
pathetic
faces
somebody
had
stowed
away
one
of
the
trophies
the
spiked
german
helmet
in
the
ambulance
car
and
the
chauffeur
tom
stuck
it
on
a
stick
and
held
it
up
before
the
british
lines
it
was
greeted
with
cheers
and
a
great
shout
of
laughter
from
the
troops
and
the
villagers
came
running
out
of
their
houses
to
look
they
uttered
little
sharp
and
guttural
cries
of
satisfaction
the
whole
thing
was
a
bit
savage
and
barbaric
and
horribly
impressive
finally
we
left
the
british
lines
and
set
out
towards
melle
by
a
we
got
through
all
right
a
thousand
accidents
may
delay
his
going
but
once
off
no
barriers
exist
for
the
commandant
seated
in
the
front
of
the
car
utterly
unperturbed
by
the
chauffeur
tom
sarcastic
comments
on
men
things
and
women
wrapped
apparently
in
a
beautiful
dream
he
looks
straight
ahead
with
eyes
whose
vagueness
veils
a
deadly
simplicity
of
purpose
i
marvel
at
the
transfiguration
of
the
commandant
before
the
war
he
was
a
fairly
complex
personality
now
he
has
ceased
to
exist
as
a
separate
individual
he
is
merged
vaguely
and
vastly
in
his
adventure
he
is
the
motor
ambulance
field
corps
he
is
the
ambulance
car
he
is
the
electric
spark
and
the
continuous
explosion
that
drives
the
thing
along
it
is
useless
to
talk
to
him
about
anything
that
happened
before
the
war
or
about
anything
that
exists
outside
it
he
would
not
admit
that
anything
did
exist
outside
it
he
is
capable
of
forgetting
the
day
of
the
week
and
the
precise
number
of
female
units
in
his
company
and
the
amount
standing
to
his
credit
at
his
banker
but
once
off
he
is
of
the
shortest
cut
to
the
within
a
radius
of
fifty
kilometres
some
of
us
who
have
never
seen
a
human
phenomenon
of
this
sort
are
ready
to
deny
him
an
identity
they
complain
of
his
inveterate
and
deplorable
lack
of
any
sense
of
detail
this
is
absurd
you
might
as
well
insist
on
a
faithful
representation
of
the
household
furniture
of
the
burgomaster
of
zoetenaeg
which
is
the
smallest
village
in
belgium
in
drawing
the
map
of
europe
to
scale
at
the
critical
moment
this
more
than
continental
vastness
gathers
to
a
determination
that
goes
home
he
means
to
get
through
we
ran
into
melle
about
an
hour
before
sunset
there
had
been
a
great
slaughter
of
germans
on
the
field
outside
the
village
where
the
germans
were
still
firing
when
the
corps
left
it
we
found
two
of
our
cars
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
the
village
street
close
under
the
houses
the
chaplain
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
were
waiting
in
one
of
them
the
new
daimler
with
the
chauffeur
newlands
wilson
was
in
bert
car
with
three
wounded
germans
he
was
sitting
in
front
with
one
of
them
beside
him
they
say
that
the
enemy
wounded
sometimes
fire
on
our
surgeons
and
red
cross
men
and
wilson
had
a
revolver
about
him
when
he
went
on
the
yesterday
he
said
he
was
taking
any
risks
the
man
he
had
got
beside
him
was
only
wounded
in
the
foot
and
had
his
hands
entirely
free
to
do
what
he
liked
with
he
looked
rather
a
low
type
and
at
the
first
sight
of
him
i
thought
i
should
have
cared
to
be
alone
with
him
anywhere
on
a
dark
night
and
then
i
saw
the
look
on
his
face
he
was
purely
pathetic
he
look
at
you
he
stared
in
front
of
him
down
the
road
towards
ghent
in
a
dull
helpless
misery
these
unhappy
german
tommies
are
afraid
of
us
they
are
told
that
we
shall
treat
them
badly
and
some
of
them
believe
it
i
wanted
wilson
to
let
me
get
up
and
go
with
the
poor
fellow
but
he
would
he
was
sorry
for
him
and
very
gentle
he
is
always
sorry
for
people
and
very
gentle
so
i
knew
that
the
german
would
be
all
right
with
him
but
i
should
have
liked
to
have
gone
we
found
torrence
and
janet
with
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
left
behind
by
wilson
they
have
been
working
all
day
yesterday
and
half
the
night
and
all
this
morning
and
afternoon
on
that
hideous
they
have
seen
things
and
combinations
of
things
that
no
forewarning
imagination
could
have
devised
last
night
the
car
was
fired
on
where
it
stood
waiting
for
them
in
the
village
and
they
had
to
race
back
to
it
under
a
shower
of
bullets
they
were
as
fresh
as
paint
and
very
cheerful
torrence
was
wearing
a
large
silver
order
on
a
broad
blue
ribbon
pinned
to
her
khaki
overcoat
it
was
given
to
her
as
the
reward
of
valour
by
the
belgian
general
in
command
here
somebody
took
it
from
the
breast
of
a
prussian
officer
she
had
covered
it
up
with
her
khaki
scarf
so
that
she
might
not
seem
to
swank
little
janet
was
with
her
she
always
is
with
her
she
looked
younger
than
ever
more
impassive
than
ever
more
adorable
than
ever
i
have
got
used
to
torrence
and
to
ursula
dearmer
but
i
can
not
get
used
to
janet
it
always
seems
appalling
to
me
that
she
should
be
here
strolling
about
the
seat
of
war
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
as
if
a
battle
were
a
at
which
you
looked
on
between
your
innings
and
yet
there
is
a
man
in
the
corps
who
does
his
work
better
and
with
more
courage
and
endurance
than
this
child
they
told
us
that
there
were
no
french
or
belgian
wounded
left
but
that
two
wounded
germans
were
still
lying
over
there
among
the
turnips
they
were
waiting
for
our
car
to
come
out
and
take
these
men
up
the
car
was
now
drawn
up
close
under
some
building
that
looked
like
a
town
hall
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
we
were
in
the
middle
of
the
village
the
village
itself
was
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
danger
zone
where
the
houses
ended
a
stretch
of
white
road
ran
up
for
about
a
hundred
yards
to
the
standing
in
the
village
street
we
could
see
the
but
not
all
of
it
the
road
goes
straight
up
to
the
edge
of
it
and
turns
there
with
a
sweep
to
the
left
and
runs
alongside
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
on
the
other
side
of
the
were
the
german
lines
the
first
that
had
raked
the
village
street
also
raked
the
fields
and
the
mile
and
a
half
of
road
alongside
it
was
along
that
road
that
the
car
would
have
to
go
told
our
ambulance
that
it
might
as
well
go
back
there
were
no
more
wounded
only
two
germans
lying
in
a
the
three
of
us
torrence
and
janet
and
i
tried
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
we
meant
to
go
and
get
those
germans
but
was
impervious
to
pressure
he
refused
either
to
go
with
the
car
himself
or
to
let
us
go
he
said
we
were
too
late
and
it
was
too
far
and
there
would
be
light
enough
he
said
that
for
two
belgians
or
two
french
or
two
british
it
would
be
worth
while
taking
risks
but
for
two
germans
under
german
fire
it
was
good
enough
but
torrence
and
janet
and
i
did
agree
with
him
wounded
were
wounded
we
said
we
were
going
if
he
was
then
the
chauffeur
tom
joined
in
he
refused
to
offer
his
car
as
a
target
for
the
enemy
our
firm
belgian
was
equally
determined
the
commandant
as
if
roused
from
his
beautiful
dream
to
a
sudden
realization
of
the
horrors
of
war
absolutely
forbade
the
expedition
it
took
place
all
the
same
tom
car
planted
there
on
our
side
of
the
street
hugging
the
wall
with
its
hood
over
its
eyes
preserved
its
attitude
of
obstinate
immobility
newlands
car
hugging
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
stood
discreetly
apart
from
the
discussion
but
a
belgian
military
ambulance
car
ran
up
smaller
and
more
alert
than
ours
and
a
belgian
army
medical
officer
strolled
up
to
see
what
was
happening
we
three
advanced
on
that
army
medical
officer
torrence
and
janet
on
his
left
and
i
on
his
right
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
that
righteous
man
he
gave
torrence
and
janet
leave
to
go
and
he
gave
me
leave
to
go
with
them
he
gave
us
the
military
ambulance
to
go
in
and
a
belgian
soldier
with
a
rifle
to
protect
us
and
he
did
waste
a
second
over
it
he
just
looked
at
us
and
smiled
and
let
us
go
torrence
got
on
to
the
ambulance
beside
the
driver
janet
jumped
on
to
one
step
and
i
on
to
the
other
while
the
commandant
came
up
trying
to
look
stern
and
told
me
to
get
down
i
hung
on
all
the
tighter
and
then
what
happened
then
was
so
ignominious
so
sickening
that
if
i
were
not
sworn
to
the
utmost
possible
realism
in
this
record
i
should
suppress
it
in
the
interests
of
human
dignity
torrence
having
the
advantage
of
me
in
weight
height
muscle
and
position
got
up
and
tried
to
push
me
off
the
step
as
she
did
this
she
said
you
ca
come
you
take
up
the
place
of
a
wounded
man
and
i
found
myself
standing
in
the
village
street
while
the
car
rushed
out
of
it
with
janet
clinging
on
to
the
hood
like
a
little
sailor
to
his
shrouds
she
was
on
the
side
next
the
german
guns
it
was
the
most
revolting
thing
that
had
happened
to
me
yet
in
a
life
filled
with
incidents
that
i
have
no
desire
to
repeat
and
it
made
me
turn
on
the
commandant
in
a
way
that
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
i
believe
i
asked
him
how
he
could
bear
to
let
that
kid
go
into
the
german
lines
which
was
exactly
what
the
poor
man
had
done
then
we
waited
lambert
and
i
in
tom
car
and
the
commandant
in
the
car
with
ursula
dearmer
and
the
chaplain
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
we
were
dreadfully
silent
now
we
stared
at
objects
that
had
no
earthly
interest
for
us
as
if
our
lives
depended
on
mastering
their
detail
we
were
thus
aware
of
a
beautiful
little
belgian
house
standing
back
from
the
village
street
down
a
short
turning
a
house
with
green
shutters
and
a
roof
of
tiles
and
a
very
small
poplar
tree
mounting
guard
beside
it
this
house
and
its
tree
were
vivid
and
very
still
they
stood
back
in
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
an
atmosphere
of
perfect
but
utterly
unreal
peace
and
as
long
as
our
memories
endure
that
house
which
we
never
saw
before
and
shall
probably
never
see
again
is
bound
up
with
the
fate
of
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
we
thought
we
should
have
an
hour
to
wait
before
they
came
back
if
they
ever
did
come
we
waited
for
them
during
a
whole
dreadful
lifetime
in
something
less
than
half
an
hour
the
military
ambulance
came
swinging
round
the
turn
of
the
road
with
torrence
and
the
kid
and
the
two
german
wounded
with
them
on
the
stretchers
those
germans
never
thought
that
they
were
going
to
be
saved
they
could
get
over
it
that
two
englishwomen
should
have
gone
through
their
fire
for
them
as
they
were
being
carried
through
the
fire
they
said
we
shall
never
forget
what
you
done
for
us
god
will
bless
you
for
it
torrence
asked
them
what
will
you
do
for
us
if
we
are
taken
prisoner
and
they
said
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
save
you
antwerp
is
said
to
have
fallen
antwerp
is
said
to
be
holding
its
own
well
all
evening
the
watching
taube
has
been
hanging
over
ghent
torrence
and
janet
have
gone
back
with
the
ambulance
to
melle
sat
up
all
night
with
there
is
one
night
nurse
for
all
the
wards
on
this
floor
and
she
has
a
serious
case
to
watch
in
another
room
but
i
can
call
her
if
i
want
help
and
there
is
the
chemist
who
sleeps
in
the
room
next
door
who
will
come
if
i
go
in
and
wake
him
up
and
there
are
our
own
four
doctors
upstairs
and
the
it
ought
to
be
all
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
most
terrible
night
i
have
ever
spent
in
my
life
and
i
have
lived
through
a
good
many
terrible
nights
in
but
no
amount
of
amateur
nursing
can
take
the
place
of
training
or
of
the
of
knowing
you
are
trained
and
even
if
you
trained
no
amount
of
medical
nursing
will
prepare
you
for
a
bad
surgical
case
to
begin
with
i
had
never
nursed
a
patient
so
tall
and
heavy
that
i
could
lift
him
by
sheer
strength
and
a
sort
of
amateur
knack
and
though
in
theory
it
was
reassuring
to
know
that
you
could
call
the
night
nurse
and
the
chemist
and
the
four
doctors
and
the
in
practice
it
did
work
out
quite
so
easily
as
it
sounded
when
the
night
nurse
came
she
could
lift
any
more
than
i
could
and
she
had
a
greater
command
of
discouraging
criticism
than
of
useful
practical
suggestion
and
the
chemist
knew
no
more
about
lifting
than
the
night
nurse
luckily
none
of
us
pretended
for
an
instant
that
we
knew
when
i
had
called
up
two
of
our
surgeons
each
once
out
of
his
bed
i
had
some
scruples
about
waking
them
again
and
it
took
four
belgian
to
do
in
five
minutes
what
one
surgeon
could
do
in
as
many
seconds
and
when
the
chemist
went
to
look
for
the
he
was
gone
for
ages
he
must
have
had
to
round
them
up
from
every
floor
in
the
hospital
whenever
any
of
them
went
to
look
for
anything
it
took
them
ages
it
was
as
if
for
every
article
needed
in
the
wards
of
that
hospital
there
was
a
separate
and
inaccessible
central
depôt
at
one
moment
a
small
pillow
had
to
be
placed
in
the
hollow
of
my
patient
back
if
he
was
to
be
kept
in
that
position
on
which
i
had
been
told
his
life
depended
when
i
sent
the
night
nurse
to
look
for
something
that
would
serve
she
was
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
which
i
realized
that
my
case
was
not
the
only
case
in
the
hospital
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
had
to
kneel
by
his
bed
with
my
two
arms
thrust
together
under
the
hollow
of
his
back
supporting
it
i
had
nothing
at
hand
that
was
small
enough
or
firm
enough
but
my
arms
that
night
i
would
have
given
everything
i
possess
and
everything
i
have
ever
done
to
have
been
a
trained
nurse
to
make
matters
worse
i
had
an
atrocious
cough
acquired
at
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
the
chemist
had
made
up
some
medicine
for
it
but
the
poor
busy
dispensary
clerk
had
forgotten
to
send
it
to
my
room
i
had
to
stop
it
by
an
expenditure
of
will
when
i
wanted
every
atom
of
will
to
keep
my
patient
quiet
and
send
him
to
sleep
if
possible
without
his
morphia
he
is
only
to
have
one
if
he
is
restless
or
in
pain
and
he
wanted
more
than
ever
to
talk
when
he
woke
and
his
conversation
in
the
night
is
even
more
lacerating
than
his
conversation
in
the
day
for
all
the
time
often
in
pain
always
in
extreme
discomfort
he
is
thinking
of
other
people
first
of
all
he
asked
me
if
i
had
any
books
and
i
thought
that
he
wanted
me
to
read
to
him
i
told
him
i
was
afraid
he
must
be
read
to
he
must
go
to
sleep
and
he
said
i
mean
for
you
to
read
yourself
to
pass
the
time
he
is
afraid
that
i
shall
be
bored
by
sitting
up
with
him
that
i
shall
tire
myself
that
i
shall
make
my
cough
worse
he
asks
me
if
i
think
he
will
ever
be
well
enough
to
play
games
that
is
what
he
has
always
wanted
to
do
most
and
then
he
begins
to
tell
me
about
his
mother
he
tells
me
things
that
i
have
no
right
to
put
down
here
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
do
for
him
but
to
will
and
i
will
hard
or
i
pray
i
do
know
which
it
is
your
acutest
willing
and
your
intensest
prayer
are
indistinguishable
and
it
seems
to
work
i
will
or
i
pray
that
he
shall
lie
still
without
morphia
and
that
he
shall
have
no
pain
and
he
lies
still
without
pain
i
will
or
i
pray
that
he
shall
sleep
without
morphia
and
he
sleeps
i
think
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
discomfort
he
must
have
slept
the
best
part
of
the
night
and
because
it
seems
to
work
i
will
or
i
pray
that
he
shall
get
well
there
are
many
things
that
obstruct
this
process
as
fast
as
it
is
begun
your
sensation
of
sight
and
touch
the
swarms
and
streams
of
images
that
your
brain
throws
out
and
the
crushing
obsession
of
your
fear
this
last
is
like
a
dead
weight
that
you
hold
off
you
with
your
arms
stretched
out
your
arms
sink
and
drop
under
it
perpetually
and
have
to
be
raised
again
at
last
the
weight
goes
and
the
sensations
go
and
the
swarms
and
streams
of
images
go
and
there
is
nothing
before
you
and
around
you
but
a
clear
blank
darkness
where
your
will
vibrates
only
one
avenue
of
sense
is
left
open
you
are
lost
to
the
very
memories
of
touch
and
sight
but
you
are
intensely
conscious
of
every
sound
from
the
bed
every
movement
of
the
sleeper
and
while
one
half
of
you
only
lives
in
that
pure
and
effortless
vibration
the
other
half
is
aware
of
the
least
change
in
the
rhythm
of
his
breathing
it
is
by
this
rhythm
that
i
can
tell
whether
he
is
asleep
or
awake
this
rhythm
of
his
breathing
and
the
rhythm
of
his
sleeping
and
his
waking
measure
out
the
night
for
me
it
goes
like
one
hour
and
yet
i
have
spent
months
of
nights
watching
in
this
room
its
blond
walls
are
as
familiar
to
me
as
the
walls
of
rooms
where
i
have
lived
a
long
time
i
know
with
a
profound
and
intimate
knowledge
every
crinkle
in
the
red
shade
of
the
electric
bulb
that
hangs
on
the
inner
wall
between
the
two
beds
the
shape
and
position
of
every
object
on
the
night
table
in
the
little
i
know
every
trick
of
the
inner
and
outer
doors
leading
to
the
corridor
and
the
long
grey
lane
of
the
corridor
and
the
room
that
i
must
go
through
to
find
ice
and
the
face
of
the
little
who
sleeps
there
who
wants
to
get
up
and
break
the
ice
for
me
every
time
i
have
known
the
little
all
my
life
i
have
known
the
night
nurse
all
my
life
with
her
white
face
and
sharp
black
eyes
and
all
my
life
i
have
not
cared
for
her
all
my
life
i
have
known
and
cared
only
for
the
wounded
man
on
the
bed
i
have
known
every
sound
of
his
voice
and
every
line
of
his
face
and
hands
the
face
and
hands
that
he
asks
me
to
wash
over
and
over
again
if
i
do
mind
and
the
strong
springing
of
his
dark
hair
from
his
forehead
and
every
little
feathery
tuft
of
beard
on
his
chin
and
i
have
known
no
other
measure
of
time
than
the
rhythm
of
his
breathing
no
mark
or
sign
of
time
than
the
black
crescent
of
his
eyelashes
when
the
lids
are
closed
and
the
curling
blue
of
his
eyes
when
they
open
his
eyes
always
smile
as
they
open
as
if
he
apologized
for
waking
when
he
knows
that
i
want
him
to
sleep
and
i
have
known
these
things
so
long
that
each
one
of
them
is
already
like
a
separate
wound
in
my
memory
he
sums
up
for
me
all
the
heroism
and
the
agony
and
waste
of
the
defence
of
antwerp
all
the
heroism
and
agony
and
waste
of
war
about
midnight
he
wakes
and
tells
me
he
has
had
a
jolly
dream
he
dreamed
that
he
was
running
in
a
field
in
england
running
in
a
big
race
that
he
led
the
race
and
won
it
one
bad
symptom
is
disappearing
towards
dawn
it
has
almost
gone
he
really
does
seem
stronger
he
has
had
no
return
of
pain
or
restlessness
but
he
was
to
have
a
morphia
at
five
and
they
have
given
it
to
him
to
make
sure
the
night
has
not
been
so
terrible
after
all
it
has
gone
like
an
hour
and
i
have
left
him
sleeping
i
am
not
in
the
least
bit
tired
i
never
felt
drowsy
once
and
my
cough
has
nearly
gone
antwerp
has
fallen
taube
over
ghent
in
the
night
six
doctors
have
seen
they
all
say
he
is
ever
so
much
better
they
even
say
he
may
live
that
he
has
a
good
chance
wilson
is
taking
foster
to
england
this
morning
went
back
to
the
hôtel
cecil
to
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
an
enormous
oval
is
leaning
flat
against
the
wall
but
by
no
possibility
can
it
be
set
up
still
the
landlord
said
he
would
find
a
table
and
he
has
found
one
went
back
to
the
flandria
for
lunch
in
the
janet
tells
me
that
case
has
been
taken
out
of
my
hands
i
am
not
to
try
to
do
any
more
nursing
little
janet
looks
as
if
she
were
trying
to
soften
a
blow
but
it
a
blow
far
from
it
it
is
the
end
of
an
intolerable
responsibility
the
commandant
and
the
chaplain
started
about
nine
or
ten
this
morning
for
melle
and
are
not
back
yet
we
expect
that
we
may
have
to
clear
out
of
ghent
before
riley
lambert
and
janet
have
gone
in
the
second
car
to
melle
i
waited
in
all
afternoon
on
the
chance
of
being
taken
when
the
commandant
comes
and
goes
out
again
he
is
not
back
yet
i
am
very
anxious
the
germans
may
be
in
melle
by
now
one
of
the
old
officials
in
peaked
caps
has
called
on
me
solemnly
this
afternoon
he
is
the
most
mysterious
of
them
all
an
old
man
with
a
white
moustache
who
never
seems
to
do
anything
but
hang
about
he
is
certainly
not
an
he
called
ostensibly
to
ask
some
question
and
remained
to
talk
i
think
he
thought
he
would
pump
me
he
began
by
asking
if
we
women
enjoyed
going
out
with
the
field
ambulance
he
supposed
we
felt
very
daring
and
looked
on
the
whole
thing
as
an
adventure
i
detected
some
sinister
intention
and
replied
that
that
was
not
exactly
the
idea
that
our
women
went
out
to
help
to
save
the
lives
of
the
wounded
soldiers
and
that
they
had
succeeded
in
this
object
over
and
over
again
and
that
i
did
imagine
they
thought
of
anything
much
except
their
duty
we
certainly
were
not
out
for
amusement
then
he
took
another
line
he
told
me
that
the
reason
why
our
ambulance
is
to
be
put
under
the
charge
of
the
british
general
here
we
had
heard
that
the
whole
of
the
belgian
army
was
shortly
to
be
under
the
control
of
the
british
and
the
whole
of
the
belgian
red
cross
with
it
the
reason
is
that
its
behaviour
in
going
into
the
has
been
criticized
and
when
i
ask
him
on
what
grounds
it
turns
out
that
somebody
thinks
there
is
a
risk
of
our
ambulance
drawing
down
the
fire
on
the
lines
it
serves
i
told
him
that
in
all
the
time
i
had
been
with
the
ambulance
it
had
never
placed
itself
in
any
position
that
could
possibly
have
drawn
down
fire
on
the
belgians
and
that
i
had
never
heard
of
any
single
instance
of
this
danger
and
i
made
him
confess
that
there
was
no
proof
or
even
rumour
of
any
single
instance
when
it
had
occurred
i
further
told
the
old
gentleman
very
plainly
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
said
or
repeated
and
that
every
man
and
woman
in
the
english
ambulance
would
rather
lose
their
own
life
than
risk
that
of
one
belgian
soldier
the
old
gentleman
was
somewhat
flattened
out
before
he
left
me
having
it
is
a
delicious
idea
that
kitchener
and
joffre
should
be
reorganizing
the
allied
armies
because
of
the
behaviour
of
our
ambulance
there
are
gordon
highlanders
in
ghent
went
over
to
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
where
miss
is
with
her
british
wounded
i
had
to
warn
her
that
the
germans
may
come
in
i
had
told
the
commandant
about
her
yesterday
and
arranged
with
him
that
we
should
take
her
and
her
british
away
in
our
ambulance
if
we
have
to
go
i
had
to
find
out
how
many
there
would
be
to
take
the
convent
is
a
little
way
beyond
the
on
the
boulevard
i
knew
it
by
the
red
cross
hanging
from
the
upper
windows
everything
is
as
happy
and
peaceful
here
as
if
ghent
were
not
on
the
eve
of
an
invasion
the
nuns
took
me
to
miss
in
her
ward
i
hardly
knew
her
for
she
had
changed
the
uniform
of
the
british
field
hospital
for
the
white
linen
of
the
belgian
red
cross
i
found
her
in
charge
of
the
ward
absolutely
unperturbed
by
the
news
she
went
on
superintending
the
disposal
of
a
table
of
surgical
instruments
she
would
not
consent
to
come
with
us
at
first
but
the
nuns
persuaded
her
that
she
would
do
no
good
by
remaining
i
am
to
come
again
and
tell
her
what
time
to
be
ready
with
her
wounded
when
we
know
whether
we
are
going
and
when
came
back
to
the
flandria
and
finished
entries
in
my
the
commandant
has
come
back
from
melle
but
he
is
going
there
again
almost
directly
he
has
been
to
the
british
lines
and
heard
for
certain
that
the
germans
will
be
in
ghent
before
morning
we
have
orders
to
clear
out
before
two
in
the
morning
i
am
to
have
all
his
things
packed
by
midnight
the
british
consul
has
left
ghent
the
news
spread
through
the
flandria
max
has
gone
about
all
day
with
a
scared
white
face
they
say
he
is
suffering
from
cold
feet
but
i
will
not
believe
it
he
has
just
appeared
in
the
and
summoned
me
mysteriously
he
takes
me
along
the
corridor
to
that
room
of
his
which
he
is
so
proud
of
there
is
a
uniform
lying
on
the
bed
the
uniform
of
a
french
soldier
of
the
line
max
handles
it
with
love
and
holy
adoration
as
a
priest
handles
his
sacred
vestments
he
takes
it
in
his
arms
he
spreads
before
me
the
coat
the
trousers
and
his
queer
eyes
are
in
their
solemnity
large
and
quiet
as
dark
moons
max
is
going
to
rejoin
his
regiment
it
is
sheer
nervous
excitement
that
gave
him
that
wild
white
face
max
is
confident
that
we
shall
meet
again
and
i
have
a
horrid
vision
of
max
carried
on
a
bloody
stretcher
a
brutally
wounded
max
he
has
given
me
his
address
in
brussels
which
will
not
find
him
there
for
long
enough
if
ever
jean
also
is
to
rejoin
his
regiment
marie
the
stands
at
the
door
of
the
service
room
and
watches
us
with
frightened
eyes
she
follows
me
into
the
and
shuts
the
door
the
poor
thing
has
been
seized
with
panic
and
her
one
idea
is
to
get
away
from
ghent
can
i
find
a
place
for
her
on
one
of
our
ambulance
cars
she
will
squeeze
in
anywhere
she
will
stand
outside
on
the
step
will
i
take
her
back
to
england
she
will
do
any
sort
of
work
no
matter
what
and
she
wo
ask
for
wages
if
only
i
will
take
her
there
i
tell
her
we
are
not
going
to
england
we
are
going
to
bruges
we
have
to
follow
the
belgian
army
wherever
it
is
sent
then
will
i
take
her
to
bruges
she
has
a
mother
there
it
is
ghastly
i
have
to
tell
her
that
it
is
impossible
that
there
will
be
no
place
for
her
in
the
ambulance
cars
that
they
will
be
crammed
with
wounded
that
we
will
have
to
stand
on
the
steps
ourselves
that
i
do
not
know
how
many
we
shall
have
to
take
from
the
convent
or
how
many
from
the
hospitals
that
i
can
do
nothing
without
the
orders
and
that
the
commandant
is
not
here
and
she
pleads
and
implores
she
can
not
believe
that
we
can
be
so
cruel
and
i
find
my
voice
growing
hard
and
stern
with
sheer
wrenching
pity
at
last
i
tell
her
that
if
there
is
room
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
but
that
i
am
afraid
that
there
will
not
be
room
she
stays
she
clings
trying
to
extort
through
pity
a
more
certain
promise
and
i
have
to
tell
her
to
go
she
goes
looking
at
me
with
the
dull
resentment
of
a
helpless
creature
whom
i
have
hurt
the
fact
that
she
has
left
me
sick
with
pity
will
not
do
her
any
good
nothing
can
do
her
any
good
but
that
place
on
the
ambulance
which
i
have
no
power
to
give
her
for
marie
is
not
the
only
one
i
see
all
the
servants
in
the
flandria
coming
to
me
before
the
night
is
over
and
clinging
and
pleading
for
a
place
in
the
ambulance
cars
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
after
marie
comes
janet
mcneil
she
poor
child
has
surrendered
to
the
overpowering
assault
on
her
feelings
and
has
pledged
herself
to
smuggle
the
four
young
children
of
madame
into
the
ambulance
somehow
i
do
see
how
it
was
possible
for
her
to
endure
the
agony
of
refusing
this
request
but
what
we
are
to
do
with
four
young
children
in
cars
packed
with
wounded
soldiers
through
all
the
stages
of
the
belgian
army
retreat
the
next
problem
that
faced
me
was
the
commandant
packing
how
to
get
all
the
things
he
had
brought
with
him
into
one
small
gladstone
bag
and
a
there
was
a
blue
serge
suit
two
a
large
burberry
a
great
many
socks
and
stockings
an
assortment
of
neckties
a
quantity
of
small
miscellaneous
objects
whose
fugitive
tendencies
he
proposed
to
frustrate
by
confinement
in
a
large
tin
there
was
the
itself
a
tobacco
tin
a
packet
of
gillette
razors
a
pipe
a
leather
case
containing
some
electric
apparatus
and
a
fat
scarlet
volume
freud
psychopathology
of
everyday
life
all
these
things
he
had
pointed
out
to
me
as
they
lay
flung
on
the
bed
or
strewn
about
the
room
he
had
impressed
on
me
the
absolute
necessity
of
packing
every
one
of
them
and
by
the
pathetic
grouping
around
the
gladstone
bag
of
the
the
the
case
of
instruments
and
freud
i
gathered
that
he
believed
that
they
would
all
enter
the
bag
placably
and
be
contained
in
it
with
ease
the
night
is
still
young
i
pack
the
gladstone
bag
by
alternate
coaxing
and
coercion
freud
and
the
and
the
occupy
it
amicably
enough
but
the
case
of
instruments
offers
an
unconquerable
resistance
the
night
is
not
quite
so
young
as
it
has
been
and
i
think
i
must
have
left
off
packing
to
run
over
to
the
hôtel
cecil
and
pay
my
bill
for
i
remember
going
out
into
the
and
seeing
a
crowd
drawn
up
in
the
middle
of
it
before
the
flandria
an
official
was
addressing
this
crowd
ordering
them
to
give
up
their
revolvers
and
any
arms
they
had
on
them
the
fate
of
ghent
depends
on
absolute
obedience
to
this
order
when
i
get
back
i
find
torrence
downstairs
in
the
hall
of
the
flandria
i
ask
her
what
we
had
better
do
about
our
refugee
children
she
says
we
can
do
nothing
there
must
be
no
refugee
children
how
there
be
in
an
ambulance
packed
with
wounded
men
when
i
tell
her
that
the
children
will
certainly
be
there
if
somebody
does
do
something
to
stop
them
she
goes
off
to
do
it
i
do
not
envy
her
her
job
she
is
not
enjoying
it
herself
first
of
all
she
has
got
to
break
it
to
janet
and
janet
will
have
to
break
it
to
the
mother
as
to
poor
marie
she
is
out
of
the
question
shall
have
to
break
it
to
marie
the
night
goes
on
i
sit
with
for
a
little
while
i
have
still
to
finish
the
commandant
packing
i
have
not
yet
begun
my
own
and
it
is
time
that
i
should
go
round
to
the
convent
to
tell
miss
to
be
ready
with
her
british
before
two
i
sit
with
him
for
what
seems
a
very
long
time
it
is
appalling
to
me
that
the
time
should
seem
long
for
it
is
really
such
a
little
while
and
when
it
is
over
there
will
be
nothing
more
that
i
shall
ever
do
for
him
this
thought
is
not
prominent
and
vivid
it
is
barely
discernible
but
it
is
there
a
dull
background
of
pain
under
my
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
english
over
there
in
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
it
is
more
than
time
that
i
should
go
and
tell
them
to
be
ready
he
holds
out
his
hands
to
be
sponged
if
i
do
mind
i
sponge
them
over
and
over
again
with
iced
water
and
eau
de
cologne
gently
and
very
slowly
i
am
afraid
lest
he
should
be
aware
that
there
is
any
hurry
the
time
goes
on
and
my
anxiety
becomes
acuter
every
minute
till
with
each
slow
lingering
turn
of
my
hand
i
think
if
i
do
go
soon
it
will
be
too
late
i
hear
that
the
children
will
be
all
right
somebody
has
had
a
de
and
janet
was
the
victim
it
is
past
midnight
and
very
dark
the
and
the
boulevards
are
deserted
i
can
not
see
the
red
cross
flag
hanging
from
the
window
of
the
convent
the
boulevards
look
all
the
same
in
the
blackness
and
i
turn
up
the
one
to
the
left
i
run
on
and
on
very
fast
but
i
can
not
see
the
white
flag
with
the
red
cross
anywhere
i
run
back
thinking
i
must
have
passed
it
turn
and
go
on
again
there
is
nobody
in
sight
no
sound
anywhere
but
the
sound
of
my
own
feet
running
faster
and
faster
up
the
wrong
boulevard
at
last
i
know
i
have
gone
too
far
the
houses
are
entirely
strange
i
run
back
to
the
to
get
my
bearings
and
start
again
i
run
faster
than
ever
i
pass
a
solitary
civilian
coming
down
the
boulevard
the
place
is
so
empty
and
so
still
that
he
and
i
seem
to
be
the
only
things
alive
and
awake
in
this
quarter
of
the
town
as
i
pass
he
turns
to
look
after
me
wondering
at
the
solitary
lady
running
so
fast
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
i
see
the
red
cross
flag
in
the
distance
and
i
come
to
a
door
that
looks
like
the
door
of
the
convent
it
the
door
of
the
convent
i
ring
the
bell
i
ring
it
many
times
nobody
comes
i
ring
a
little
louder
a
tired
lay
sister
puts
her
head
out
of
an
upper
window
and
asks
me
what
i
want
i
tell
her
she
is
rather
cross
and
says
i
come
to
the
wrong
door
i
must
go
to
the
second
door
and
she
puts
her
head
in
and
shuts
the
window
with
a
clang
that
expresses
her
just
resentment
i
go
to
the
second
door
and
ring
many
times
again
and
another
lay
sister
puts
her
head
out
of
an
upper
window
she
is
gentle
but
sleepy
and
very
slow
she
can
not
take
it
in
all
at
once
she
says
they
are
all
asleep
in
the
convent
and
she
does
not
like
to
wake
them
she
says
this
several
times
so
that
i
may
understand
i
am
exasperated
madame
de
grâce
la
vie
ou
la
mort
the
minute
i
said
it
it
sounds
to
me
melodramatic
and
absurd
am
melodramatic
and
absurd
with
my
running
feet
and
my
small
figure
and
earnest
upturned
face
standing
under
a
convent
wall
at
midnight
and
talking
about
vie
et
la
it
is
too
improbable
am
too
improbable
i
feel
that
i
am
making
a
fuss
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
occasion
and
i
am
sorry
for
frightening
the
poor
lay
sister
all
for
nothing
very
soon
down
the
road
the
germans
will
be
marching
upon
ghent
and
i
can
not
realize
it
the
whole
thing
is
too
improbable
but
the
lay
sister
has
understood
this
time
she
will
go
and
wake
the
porteress
she
is
not
at
all
frightened
i
wait
a
little
longer
and
presently
the
porteress
opens
the
door
when
she
hears
my
message
she
goes
away
and
returns
after
a
little
while
with
one
of
the
nuns
they
are
very
quiet
very
kind
and
absolutely
unafraid
they
say
that
miss
and
her
british
wounded
shall
be
ready
before
two
i
go
back
to
the
flandria
the
commandant
who
went
out
to
melle
in
tom
car
has
not
come
back
yet
i
think
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
have
gone
to
bed
they
are
not
taking
the
germans
very
seriously
there
is
nobody
in
the
but
the
other
three
chauffeurs
bert
tom
and
newlands
newlands
has
just
come
back
from
ostend
they
have
had
no
supper
we
bustle
about
to
find
some
we
all
know
the
germans
are
coming
into
ghent
but
we
do
not
speak
of
it
we
are
all
very
polite
almost
supernaturally
gentle
and
very
kind
to
each
other
the
beautiful
manners
of
newlands
are
conspicuous
in
this
hour
the
tragedy
of
which
we
are
affecting
to
ignore
i
behave
as
if
there
was
nothing
so
important
in
the
world
as
cutting
bread
for
newlands
newlands
behaves
as
if
there
were
nothing
so
important
as
fetching
a
bottle
of
formamint
which
he
has
with
him
to
cure
my
cough
it
has
burst
out
again
worse
than
ever
after
the
unnatural
repression
of
last
night
when
the
chauffeurs
are
provided
with
supper
i
go
into
the
room
and
finish
his
packing
the
ties
the
and
the
collars
are
all
safe
in
the
gladstone
bag
only
the
underclothing
and
the
suits
remain
and
there
is
any
amount
of
room
for
them
in
the
i
roll
up
the
blue
serge
coat
and
the
trousers
and
the
waistcoat
very
smooth
and
tight
also
the
underclothes
it
seems
very
simple
i
have
only
got
to
put
them
in
the
and
then
roll
it
up
smooth
and
tight
too
it
would
have
been
simple
if
the
had
been
a
simple
and
if
it
had
been
nothing
more
but
it
was
also
a
and
a
as
it
was
provided
with
a
thick
blanket
which
took
up
most
of
the
room
inside
and
a
waterproof
sheet
which
was
part
of
itself
as
it
had
large
protruding
flanges
shaped
like
and
a
complicated
system
of
ropes
first
of
all
i
tucked
in
the
and
ropes
and
laid
them
as
flat
as
might
be
on
the
bottom
of
the
with
the
blanket
on
the
top
of
them
then
i
packed
the
clothes
on
the
top
of
the
blanket
and
turned
it
over
them
to
make
all
snug
i
buttoned
up
the
waterproof
sheet
over
everything
rolled
up
the
and
secured
it
with
its
straps
this
was
only
done
by
much
stratagem
and
strength
by
desperate
tugging
and
pushing
and
by
lying
flat
on
my
waist
on
the
half
to
keep
it
quiet
while
i
brought
the
loose
half
over
no
sooner
had
i
secured
the
by
its
straps
than
i
realized
that
it
was
no
more
a
than
it
was
a
and
a
field
tent
and
that
its
contents
were
exposed
to
the
weather
down
one
side
where
they
bulged
through
the
spaces
that
yawned
between
the
buttons
strained
almost
to
bursting
i
still
believed
in
the
genius
that
had
devised
this
trinity
clearly
the
which
made
it
a
were
intended
to
serve
also
as
the
pockets
of
the
i
had
done
wrong
to
flatten
them
out
and
tuck
them
in
frustrating
the
fulfilment
of
their
function
it
was
not
acting
fairly
by
the
inventor
i
unpacked
the
i
mean
the
then
with
the
commandant
clothes
again
lying
round
me
on
the
floor
i
grappled
with
the
mystery
of
the
and
their
cords
the
and
their
cords
were
so
to
speak
the
heart
of
this
infernal
triple
entity
they
were
treacherous
they
had
all
the
appearance
of
pockets
but
owing
to
the
intricate
and
malign
relations
of
their
cords
it
was
impossible
to
deal
faithfully
with
them
on
this
footing
when
the
contents
had
been
packed
inside
them
the
asserted
itself
as
against
the
and
refused
to
roll
up
and
i
am
sure
that
if
the
had
had
to
be
set
up
in
a
field
in
a
hurry
the
and
the
would
have
arisen
and
insisted
on
their
consubstantial
rights
i
unpacked
the
and
packed
it
all
over
again
exactly
as
i
had
packed
it
before
but
more
carefully
swearing
gently
and
continuously
as
i
tugged
with
my
arms
and
pushed
with
my
knees
and
pressed
hard
on
it
with
my
waist
to
keep
it
still
i
cursed
the
day
when
i
had
first
heard
of
it
i
cursed
myself
for
giving
it
to
the
commandant
more
than
all
i
cursed
the
combined
ingenuity
and
levity
of
its
creator
who
had
indulged
his
fantasy
at
our
expense
without
a
thought
to
the
actual
conditions
of
the
retreat
of
armies
and
of
ambulances
and
in
the
middle
of
it
all
janet
came
in
and
curled
herself
up
in
a
corner
and
forecast
luridly
and
inconsolably
the
possible
fate
of
her
friends
the
nurses
in
the
flandria
for
the
moment
her
coolness
and
her
wise
impassivity
had
gone
her
behaviour
was
lacerating
this
was
the
very
worst
moment
we
had
come
to
yet
and
it
seemed
that
ursula
dearmer
and
lambert
had
gone
to
bed
regardless
of
the
retreat
from
ghent
somewhere
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
commandant
came
back
from
melle
it
is
nearly
two
downstairs
in
the
great
silent
hall
two
british
wounded
are
waiting
for
some
ambulance
to
take
them
to
the
station
they
are
sitting
bolt
upright
on
chairs
near
the
doorway
their
heads
nodding
with
drowsiness
one
or
two
belgian
red
cross
men
wait
beside
them
opposite
them
on
three
other
chairs
the
three
doctors
haynes
bird
and
sit
waiting
for
our
own
ambulance
to
take
them
they
have
been
up
all
night
and
are
utterly
exhausted
they
sit
fast
asleep
with
their
heads
bowed
on
their
breasts
outside
the
darkness
has
mist
and
a
raw
cold
sting
in
it
a
wretched
ambulance
wagon
drawn
by
two
horses
is
driven
up
to
the
door
it
had
a
hood
once
but
the
hood
has
disappeared
and
only
the
naked
hoops
remain
the
british
wounded
from
two
other
hospitals
are
packed
in
it
in
two
rows
they
sit
bolt
upright
under
the
hoops
exposed
to
mist
and
to
the
raw
cold
sting
of
the
night
some
of
them
wear
their
blankets
like
shawls
over
their
shoulders
as
they
were
taken
from
their
beds
the
shawls
and
the
head
bandages
give
these
british
a
strange
foreign
look
infinitely
helpless
infinitely
pitiful
nobody
seems
to
be
out
there
but
torrence
and
one
or
two
belgian
red
cross
men
she
and
i
help
to
get
our
two
men
taken
gently
out
of
the
hall
and
stowed
away
in
the
ambulance
wagon
there
are
not
enough
blankets
we
try
to
find
some
at
the
last
minute
two
bearers
come
forward
carrying
a
third
he
is
tall
and
thin
he
is
wrapped
in
a
coat
flung
loosely
over
his
he
wears
a
turban
of
bandages
his
long
bare
feet
stick
out
as
he
is
carried
along
it
is
cameron
my
poor
highlander
who
was
shot
through
the
brain
they
lift
him
very
gently
into
the
wagon
then
very
gently
they
lift
him
out
again
this
attempt
to
save
him
is
desperate
he
is
dying
they
carry
him
up
the
steps
and
stand
him
there
with
his
naked
feet
on
the
stone
it
is
anguish
to
see
those
thin
white
feet
on
the
stone
i
take
off
my
coat
and
put
it
under
them
it
is
all
i
can
do
for
him
presently
they
carry
him
back
into
the
hospital
they
ca
find
any
blankets
i
run
over
to
the
hôtel
cecil
for
my
thick
warm
to
wrap
round
the
knees
of
the
wounded
shivering
in
the
wagon
it
is
all
i
can
do
for
them
and
presently
the
wagon
is
turned
round
slowly
almost
solemnly
and
driven
off
into
the
darkness
and
the
cold
mist
with
its
load
of
weird
and
piteous
figures
wrapped
in
blankets
like
shawls
their
bandages
show
blurred
white
spots
in
the
mist
and
they
are
gone
it
is
horrible
i
am
reminded
that
i
have
not
packed
yet
nor
dressed
for
the
journey
i
go
over
and
pack
and
dress
i
leave
behind
what
i
do
need
and
it
takes
seven
minutes
there
is
something
sad
and
terrible
about
the
little
hotel
and
its
proprietors
and
their
daughter
who
has
waited
on
me
they
have
so
much
the
air
of
waiting
of
being
on
the
eve
they
hang
about
doing
nothing
they
sit
mournfully
in
a
corner
of
the
restaurant
as
i
come
and
go
they
smile
at
me
with
the
patient
belgian
smile
that
says
triste
pas
and
no
more
the
landlord
puts
on
his
soft
brown
felt
hat
and
carries
my
luggage
over
to
the
flandria
he
stays
there
hanging
about
the
porch
fascinated
by
these
preparations
for
departure
there
is
the
same
terrible
here
the
same
expectant
stillness
now
and
then
the
servants
of
the
hospital
look
at
each
other
and
there
are
whisperings
mutterings
they
sound
sinister
somehow
and
inimical
or
perhaps
i
imagine
this
because
i
do
not
take
kindly
to
retreating
anyhow
i
am
only
aware
of
them
afterwards
for
now
it
is
time
to
go
and
fetch
miss
and
her
three
wounded
men
from
the
convent
tom
has
come
up
with
his
first
ambulance
car
he
is
waiting
for
orders
in
the
porch
his
enormous
motor
goggles
are
pushed
up
over
the
peak
of
his
cap
they
make
it
look
like
some
formidable
helmet
they
give
an
air
of
mastership
to
tom
face
at
this
last
hour
it
wears
its
expression
of
righteous
protest
of
volcanic
patience
of
exasperated
discipline
the
commandant
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
every
minute
of
his
delay
increases
tom
sense
of
tortured
integrity
i
tell
tom
that
he
is
to
drive
me
at
once
to
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
he
wants
to
know
what
for
i
tell
him
it
is
to
fetch
miss
and
three
british
wounded
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
he
knows
nothing
about
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
and
miss
and
three
british
wounded
and
his
shrug
implies
that
he
cares
less
and
he
says
he
has
no
orders
to
go
and
fetch
them
i
perceive
that
in
this
supreme
moment
i
am
up
against
superstition
he
wo
move
anywhere
without
orders
it
is
his
one
means
of
putting
himself
in
the
right
and
everybody
else
in
the
wrong
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
right
i
am
also
up
against
tom
sex
prejudices
i
remember
that
he
is
said
to
have
sworn
with
an
oath
that
he
was
going
to
take
orders
from
any
woman
and
the
commandant
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
tom
sticks
to
the
ledge
of
the
porch
and
stares
at
me
defiantly
the
servants
of
the
hospital
come
out
and
look
at
us
they
are
so
many
reinforcements
to
tom
position
i
tell
him
that
the
arrangement
has
been
made
with
the
consent
and
i
repeat
firmly
that
he
is
to
get
into
his
car
this
minute
and
drive
to
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
he
says
he
does
not
know
where
the
convent
is
it
may
be
anywhere
i
tell
him
where
it
is
and
he
says
again
he
has
got
orders
i
stand
over
him
and
with
savage
and
violent
determination
i
say
you
got
them
and
actually
tom
obeys
he
says
right
all
right
all
right
very
fast
and
humps
his
shoulders
and
slouches
off
to
his
car
he
cranks
it
up
with
less
vehemence
than
i
have
yet
known
him
bring
to
the
starting
of
any
car
we
get
in
then
and
not
till
then
i
am
placable
i
say
you
see
tom
it
would
do
to
leave
that
lady
and
three
british
wounded
behind
would
it
what
he
says
about
orders
then
is
purely
by
way
of
apology
regardless
of
my
instructions
he
does
what
i
did
and
dashes
up
the
wrong
boulevard
as
if
the
germans
were
even
now
marching
into
the
behind
him
but
he
works
round
somehow
and
we
arrive
they
are
all
there
ready
and
waiting
and
the
mother
superior
and
two
of
her
nuns
are
in
the
corridor
they
bring
out
glasses
of
hot
milk
for
everybody
they
are
so
gentle
and
so
kind
that
i
recall
with
agony
my
impatience
when
i
rang
at
their
gate
even
familiar
french
words
desert
me
in
this
crisis
and
i
implore
miss
to
convey
my
regrets
for
my
rudeness
their
only
answer
is
to
smile
and
press
hot
milk
on
me
i
am
glad
of
it
for
i
have
been
so
absorbed
in
the
drama
of
preparation
that
i
have
entirely
forgotten
to
eat
anything
since
lunch
the
wounded
are
brought
along
the
passage
we
help
them
into
the
ambulance
two
williams
and
are
only
slightly
wounded
they
can
sit
up
all
the
way
but
the
third
fisher
is
wounded
in
the
head
sometimes
he
is
delirious
and
must
be
looked
after
a
fourth
man
is
dying
and
must
be
left
behind
then
we
say
to
the
nuns
the
other
ambulance
cars
are
drawn
up
in
the
before
the
flandria
waiting
for
the
first
time
i
hate
the
sight
of
them
this
feeling
is
inexplicable
but
profound
we
arrange
for
the
final
disposal
of
the
wounded
in
one
of
the
new
daimlers
where
they
can
all
lie
down
torrence
comes
out
and
helps
us
the
commandant
is
not
there
yet
haynes
and
bird
pack
away
well
inside
the
car
they
are
very
quiet
and
very
firm
and
refuse
to
travel
otherwise
than
together
torrence
goes
with
the
wounded
i
go
into
the
hospital
and
upstairs
to
our
quarters
to
see
if
anything
has
been
left
behind
if
i
can
find
marie
we
must
take
her
there
is
room
after
all
but
marie
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
nobody
is
to
be
seen
but
the
belgian
night
nurses
on
duty
watching
one
on
each
landing
at
the
entrance
to
her
corridor
they
smile
at
me
gravely
and
sadly
as
they
say
i
have
left
many
places
many
houses
many
people
behind
me
knowing
that
i
shall
never
see
them
again
but
of
all
this
seems
to
me
the
worst
for
those
others
i
have
been
something
done
something
that
absolves
me
but
for
these
and
for
this
place
i
have
not
done
anything
and
now
there
is
not
anything
to
be
done
i
go
slowly
downstairs
each
flight
is
a
more
abominable
descent
at
each
flight
i
stand
still
and
pull
myself
together
to
face
the
next
nurse
on
the
next
landing
at
the
second
story
i
go
past
without
looking
i
know
every
stain
on
the
floor
of
the
corridor
there
as
you
turn
to
the
right
the
number
of
the
door
and
the
names
on
the
card
beside
it
have
made
a
pattern
on
my
brain
it
is
quarter
to
three
they
are
all
ready
now
the
commandant
is
there
giving
the
final
orders
and
stowing
away
the
nine
wounded
he
has
brought
from
melle
the
hall
of
the
hospital
is
utterly
deserted
so
is
the
outside
it
and
in
the
stillness
and
desolation
our
going
has
an
air
of
intolerable
secrecy
of
furtive
avoidance
of
fate
this
field
ambulance
of
ours
abhors
retreat
it
is
dark
with
the
black
darkness
before
dawn
and
the
belgian
red
cross
guides
have
all
gone
there
is
nobody
to
show
us
the
roads
at
the
last
minute
we
find
a
belgian
soldier
who
will
take
us
as
far
as
ecloo
the
commandant
has
arranged
to
stay
at
ecloo
for
a
few
hours
some
friends
there
have
offered
him
their
house
the
wounded
are
to
be
put
up
at
the
convent
ecloo
is
about
between
ghent
and
bruges
we
start
tom
car
goes
first
with
the
belgian
soldier
in
front
ursula
dearmer
lambert
miss
and
riley
and
i
are
inside
the
commandant
sits
silent
wrapped
in
meditation
on
the
step
we
are
not
going
so
very
fast
not
faster
than
the
three
cars
behind
us
and
the
slowest
of
the
three
the
fiat
with
the
hard
tyres
carrying
the
baggage
sets
the
pace
we
must
keep
within
their
sight
or
they
may
lose
their
way
but
though
we
are
not
really
going
fast
the
speed
seems
intolerable
especially
the
speed
that
swings
us
out
of
sight
of
the
flandria
you
think
that
is
the
worst
but
it
is
the
speed
with
its
steady
acceleration
grows
more
intolerable
with
every
mile
your
sense
of
safety
grows
intolerable
you
never
knew
that
safety
could
hurt
like
this
somewhere
on
this
road
the
belgian
army
has
gone
before
us
we
have
got
to
go
with
it
we
have
had
our
orders
that
thought
consoles
you
but
not
for
long
you
may
call
it
following
the
belgian
army
but
the
belgian
army
is
retreating
and
you
are
retreating
with
it
there
is
nothing
else
you
can
do
but
that
does
not
make
it
any
better
and
this
speed
of
the
motor
over
the
flat
roads
this
speed
that
cuts
the
air
driving
its
furrow
so
fast
that
the
wind
rushes
by
you
like
strong
water
this
speed
that
so
inspired
and
exalted
you
when
it
brought
you
into
flanders
when
it
took
you
to
antwerp
and
baerlaere
and
lokeren
and
melle
this
vehement
and
frightful
and
relentless
speed
is
the
thing
that
beats
you
down
and
tortures
you
for
several
hours
ever
since
you
had
your
orders
to
pack
up
and
go
you
have
been
working
with
no
other
purpose
than
this
going
you
have
contemplated
it
many
times
with
equanimity
with
indifference
you
knew
all
along
that
it
was
not
possible
to
stay
in
ghent
for
ever
and
when
you
were
helping
to
get
the
wounded
into
the
ambulances
you
thought
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
get
in
yourself
and
go
with
them
when
you
had
time
to
think
about
it
you
were
even
aware
of
looking
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
thrill
of
a
clean
run
before
the
germans
you
never
thought
and
nobody
could
possibly
have
told
you
that
it
would
be
like
this
i
never
thought
and
nobody
could
possibly
have
told
me
that
i
was
going
to
behave
as
i
did
then
the
thing
began
with
the
first
turn
of
the
road
that
hid
the
flandria
up
till
that
moment
whatever
i
may
have
felt
about
the
people
we
had
to
leave
behind
us
as
long
as
none
of
our
were
left
behind
i
had
not
the
smallest
objection
to
being
saved
myself
and
if
it
had
occurred
to
me
to
stay
behind
for
the
sake
of
one
man
who
could
be
moved
and
who
had
the
best
surgeon
in
the
hospital
and
the
pick
of
the
to
look
after
him
i
think
i
should
have
disposed
of
the
idea
as
sheer
sentimentalism
when
i
was
with
him
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
wounded
in
the
couvent
de
saint
pierre
and
afterwards
there
had
been
so
much
to
do
and
now
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
i
could
think
of
anything
but
that
one
man
the
night
before
came
back
to
me
in
a
vision
or
rather
an
obsession
infinitely
more
present
more
visible
and
palpable
than
this
night
that
we
were
living
in
the
light
with
the
red
shade
hung
just
over
my
head
on
my
right
hand
the
blond
walls
were
round
me
they
shut
me
in
alone
with
the
wounded
man
who
lay
stretched
before
me
on
the
bed
and
the
moments
were
measured
by
the
rhythm
of
his
breathing
and
by
the
closing
and
opening
of
his
eyes
i
thought
he
will
open
his
eyes
and
look
for
me
and
i
shall
not
be
there
he
will
know
that
he
has
been
left
to
the
belgians
who
can
not
understand
him
whom
he
can
not
understand
and
he
will
think
that
i
have
betrayed
him
i
felt
as
if
i
betrayed
him
i
am
sitting
between
riley
and
miss
riley
is
ill
he
has
got
through
a
cut
in
his
hand
every
now
and
then
i
remember
him
and
draw
the
rug
over
his
knees
as
it
slips
miss
tired
with
her
night
watching
has
gone
to
sleep
with
her
head
on
my
shoulder
where
it
must
be
horribly
jolted
and
shaken
by
my
cough
which
of
course
chooses
this
moment
to
break
out
again
i
try
to
get
into
a
position
that
will
rest
her
better
and
between
her
and
riley
i
forget
for
a
second
then
the
obsession
begins
again
and
i
am
shut
in
between
the
blond
walls
with
the
wounded
man
i
feel
his
hand
and
arm
lying
heavily
on
my
shoulder
in
the
attempt
to
support
me
as
i
kneel
by
his
bed
with
my
arms
stretched
out
together
under
the
hollow
of
his
back
as
we
wait
for
the
pillow
that
never
comes
it
is
quite
certain
that
i
have
betrayed
him
it
seems
to
me
then
that
nothing
that
could
happen
to
me
in
ghent
could
be
more
infernal
than
leaving
it
and
i
think
that
when
the
ambulance
stops
to
put
down
the
belgian
soldier
i
will
get
out
and
walk
back
with
him
to
ghent
every
i
think
that
the
ambulance
will
stop
to
put
down
the
belgian
soldier
but
the
ambulance
does
not
stop
it
goes
on
and
on
and
we
have
got
to
ecloo
before
we
seem
to
have
put
three
miles
between
us
and
ghent
still
though
i
dead
tired
when
we
get
there
i
can
walk
three
miles
easily
i
do
not
feel
at
all
insane
with
my
obsession
on
the
contrary
these
moments
are
moments
of
exceptional
lucidity
while
the
commandant
goes
to
look
for
the
convent
i
get
out
and
look
for
the
belgian
soldier
other
belgian
soldiers
have
joined
him
in
the
village
street
i
tell
him
i
want
to
go
back
to
ghent
i
ask
him
how
far
it
is
to
walk
and
if
he
will
take
me
and
he
says
it
is
twenty
kilometres
the
other
soldiers
say
too
it
is
twenty
kilometres
i
had
thought
it
possibly
be
more
than
four
or
five
at
the
outside
and
i
am
just
sane
enough
to
know
that
i
ca
walk
as
far
as
that
if
i
to
be
any
good
when
i
get
there
we
wait
in
the
village
while
they
find
the
convent
and
take
the
wounded
men
there
we
wait
while
the
commandant
goes
off
in
the
dark
to
find
his
friend
house
the
house
stands
in
a
garden
somewhere
beyond
the
railway
station
up
a
rough
village
street
and
a
stretch
of
country
road
it
is
about
four
in
the
morning
when
we
get
there
a
thin
ooze
of
light
is
beginning
to
leak
through
the
mist
the
mist
holds
it
as
a
dark
cloth
holds
a
fluid
that
bleaches
it
there
is
something
queer
about
this
light
there
is
something
queer
something
almost
inimical
about
the
garden
as
if
it
tried
to
protect
itself
by
enchantment
from
the
fifteen
who
are
invading
it
the
mist
stands
straight
up
from
the
earth
like
a
high
wall
drawn
close
about
the
house
it
blocks
with
dense
grey
stuff
every
inch
of
space
between
the
bushes
and
trees
they
are
thrust
forward
rank
upon
rank
closing
in
upon
the
house
they
loom
enormous
and
near
a
few
paces
further
back
they
appear
as
without
substance
in
the
dense
grey
stuff
that
invests
them
their
tops
are
tangled
and
lost
in
a
web
of
grey
in
this
strange
garden
it
is
as
if
space
itself
had
solidified
in
masses
and
solid
objects
had
become
spaces
between
when
your
eyes
get
used
to
this
curious
inversion
it
is
as
if
the
mist
was
no
longer
a
wall
but
a
growth
the
garden
is
the
heart
of
a
jungle
bleached
by
enchantment
and
struck
with
stillness
and
cold
a
tangle
of
grey
a
muffled
huddled
and
stifled
bower
all
grey
and
webbed
and
laced
with
grey
the
door
of
the
house
opens
and
the
effect
of
queerness
of
inimical
magic
disappears
our
kind
dutch
host
and
our
kind
english
hostess
have
got
up
out
of
their
beds
to
receive
us
this
hospitality
of
theirs
is
not
a
little
thing
when
you
think
that
their
house
is
to
be
invaded
by
germans
perhaps
they
do
not
allow
you
to
think
of
it
for
all
you
are
to
see
of
the
tragedy
they
and
their
house
might
be
remaining
at
ecloo
in
leisure
and
perfect
hospitality
and
peace
only
as
they
see
us
pouring
in
over
their
threshold
a
hovering
twinkle
in
their
kind
eyes
shows
that
they
are
not
blind
to
the
comic
aspect
of
retreats
they
have
only
one
spare
bedroom
which
they
offer
but
they
have
filled
their
with
blankets
piles
and
piles
of
white
fleecy
blankets
on
chairs
and
sofas
and
on
the
floor
and
they
have
built
up
a
roaring
fire
it
is
as
if
they
were
succouring
fifteen
survivors
of
shipwreck
or
of
earthquake
or
the
remnants
of
a
forlorn
hope
to
be
sure
we
are
flying
from
ghent
but
we
have
only
flown
twenty
kilometres
as
yet
however
most
of
the
corps
have
been
up
all
night
for
several
nights
and
the
mist
outside
is
a
clinging
and
a
biting
mist
and
everybody
is
grateful
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
the
smothered
in
blankets
and
littered
with
the
members
of
the
corps
who
lay
about
it
in
every
pathetic
posture
of
fatigue
a
group
of
seven
or
eight
snuggled
down
among
the
blankets
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
hearth
like
a
camp
before
a
campfire
janet
mcneil
curled
up
on
one
and
ursula
dearmer
rolled
in
a
blanket
on
the
other
had
the
beauty
of
furry
animals
under
torpor
the
chauffeurs
tom
and
bert
made
themselves
entirely
lovable
by
going
to
sleep
bolt
upright
on
chairs
on
the
outer
ring
of
the
camp
the
furniture
came
in
where
it
could
with
fantastic
and
incongruous
effect
i
do
know
how
i
got
through
the
next
three
hours
for
my
obsession
came
back
on
me
again
and
again
and
as
soon
as
i
shut
my
eyes
i
saw
the
face
and
eyes
of
the
wounded
man
i
remember
sitting
part
of
the
time
beside
miss
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
bert
chair
i
remember
wandering
about
the
house
i
must
have
got
out
of
it
for
i
also
remember
finding
myself
in
their
garden
at
sunrise
and
i
remember
the
garden
though
i
was
not
perfectly
aware
of
it
at
the
time
it
had
a
divine
beauty
a
serenity
that
refused
to
enter
into
to
ally
itself
in
any
way
with
an
experience
tainted
by
the
sadness
of
the
retreat
from
ghent
but
because
of
its
supernatural
detachment
and
tranquillity
and
its
no
less
supernatural
illumination
i
recalled
it
the
more
vividly
afterwards
it
was
full
of
tall
bushes
and
little
slender
trees
standing
in
a
delicate
light
the
mist
had
cleared
to
the
transparency
of
still
water
so
still
that
under
it
the
bushes
and
the
trees
stood
in
a
cold
quiet
radiance
without
a
shimmer
the
light
itself
was
intensely
still
what
you
saw
was
not
the
approach
of
light
but
its
mysterious
arrest
it
was
held
suspended
in
crystalline
vapour
in
thin
shafts
of
violet
and
gold
clear
as
panes
it
was
caught
and
lifted
upwards
by
the
high
bushes
and
the
slender
trees
it
was
veiled
in
the
masses
of
their
tops
every
green
leaf
and
every
blade
of
grass
was
a
vessel
charged
it
was
not
so
much
that
the
light
revealed
these
things
as
that
these
things
revealed
the
light
there
was
no
kindling
touch
no
tremor
of
dawn
in
that
garden
it
was
as
if
it
had
removed
the
walls
and
put
off
the
lacing
webs
and
the
thick
cloths
of
grey
stuff
by
some
mystic
impulse
of
its
own
as
if
it
maintained
itself
in
stillness
by
an
inner
flame
only
the
very
finest
tissues
yet
clung
to
it
to
show
that
it
was
the
same
garden
that
disclosed
itself
in
this
clarity
and
beauty
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
the
chaplain
coming
to
me
and
our
going
together
into
the
and
miss
joining
us
there
my
malady
was
contagious
and
she
had
caught
it
but
with
no
damage
to
her
she
says
very
simply
and
quietly
that
she
is
going
back
to
ghent
and
the
infection
spreads
to
the
chaplain
he
says
that
neither
of
us
is
going
back
to
ghent
but
that
he
is
going
the
poor
boy
tries
to
arrange
with
us
how
he
may
best
do
it
in
secrecy
without
poisoning
the
commandant
and
the
whole
ambulance
with
the
spirit
of
return
with
difficulty
we
convince
him
that
it
would
be
useless
for
any
man
to
go
he
would
be
taken
prisoner
the
minute
he
showed
his
nose
in
the
flandria
and
set
to
dig
trenches
till
the
end
of
the
war
then
he
says
if
only
he
had
his
cassock
with
him
they
would
respect
which
is
open
to
doubt
we
are
there
a
long
time
discussing
which
of
us
is
going
back
to
ghent
miss
is
fertile
and
ingenious
in
argument
she
is
a
nurse
and
i
and
the
chaplain
are
not
she
has
friends
in
ghent
who
have
not
been
warned
whom
she
must
go
back
to
in
any
case
she
says
it
was
a
whether
she
went
or
stayed
and
while
we
are
still
arguing
we
go
out
on
the
road
that
leads
to
the
village
to
find
the
ambulances
and
see
if
any
of
the
chauffeurs
will
take
us
back
to
ghent
i
am
not
very
hopeful
about
the
means
of
transport
i
do
not
think
that
tom
or
any
of
the
chauffeurs
will
move
this
time
without
orders
from
the
commandant
i
do
not
think
that
the
commandant
will
let
any
of
us
go
except
himself
and
miss
says
if
only
she
had
a
horse
if
she
had
a
horse
she
would
be
in
ghent
in
no
time
perhaps
if
none
of
the
chauffeurs
will
take
her
back
she
can
find
a
horse
in
the
village
she
keeps
on
saying
very
quietly
and
simply
that
she
is
going
and
explaining
the
reasons
why
she
should
go
rather
than
anybody
else
and
i
bring
forward
every
reason
i
can
think
of
why
she
should
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
abhor
the
possibility
of
her
going
back
instead
of
me
but
i
am
not
yet
afraid
of
it
i
do
not
yet
think
seriously
that
she
will
do
it
i
do
not
see
how
she
is
going
to
if
the
chauffeurs
refuse
to
take
her
i
do
not
see
how
in
this
case
i
am
to
go
myself
and
i
do
not
imagine
for
one
moment
that
she
will
find
a
horse
still
i
am
vaguely
uneasy
and
the
chaplain
does
make
it
any
better
by
backing
her
up
and
declaring
that
as
she
will
be
more
good
than
either
of
us
when
she
gets
there
her
going
is
the
best
thing
that
in
the
circumstances
can
be
done
and
in
the
end
with
an
extreme
quietness
and
simplicity
she
went
we
had
not
yet
found
the
ambulance
cars
and
it
seemed
pretty
certain
that
miss
would
not
get
her
horse
any
more
than
the
chaplain
could
get
his
cassock
and
then
just
when
we
thought
the
difficulties
of
transport
were
insuperable
we
came
straight
on
the
railway
lines
and
the
station
where
a
train
had
pulled
up
on
its
way
to
ghent
miss
got
on
to
the
train
i
got
on
too
to
go
with
her
and
the
chaplain
who
is
abominably
strong
put
his
arms
round
my
waist
and
pulled
me
off
i
have
never
ceased
to
wish
that
i
had
hung
on
to
that
train
on
our
way
back
to
the
house
we
met
the
commandant
and
told
him
what
had
happened
i
said
i
thought
it
was
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
yet
it
was
the
smallest
consolation
when
he
said
it
was
the
most
sensible
solution
and
when
for
fifteen
consecutive
seconds
took
the
view
that
i
had
decoyed
miss
out
on
to
that
accursed
road
in
order
to
send
her
to
ghent
and
deliberately
persuaded
her
to
go
back
to
the
flandria
instead
of
me
for
fifteen
consecutive
seconds
i
believed
that
this
diabolical
thing
was
what
i
had
actually
done
indignation
never
blazes
away
for
more
than
fifteen
seconds
but
while
the
conflagration
lasts
it
is
terrific
and
on
circumstantial
evidence
the
case
was
black
against
me
when
last
seen
miss
was
entirely
willing
to
be
saved
she
goes
out
for
a
walk
with
me
along
a
quiet
country
road
and
the
next
thing
you
hear
is
that
she
has
gone
back
to
ghent
and
since
actually
and
really
it
was
my
obsession
that
had
passed
into
her
i
felt
that
if
i
had
taken
miss
down
that
road
and
murdered
her
in
a
dyke
my
responsibility
would
have
been
a
bit
worse
if
as
bad
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
people
scattered
among
the
blankets
in
that
strange
room
those
that
still
lay
snuggling
down
amiably
in
the
warmth
and
those
that
had
started
to
their
feet
in
dismay
and
those
that
sat
on
chairs
upright
and
apart
were
hostile
with
a
just
and
righteous
hostility
that
they
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
my
crime
and
had
risen
up
in
abhorrence
of
the
thing
i
was
and
somewhere
as
if
they
were
far
off
in
some
blessed
place
on
the
other
side
of
this
nightmare
i
was
aware
of
the
merciful
and
pitiful
faces
of
lambert
and
janet
mcneil
then
close
beside
me
there
was
a
sudden
heaving
of
the
broad
shoulders
as
he
faced
the
room
and
i
heard
him
saying
in
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
declared
that
he
was
going
to
hold
matins
that
it
was
my
fault
at
all
that
it
was
who
had
persuaded
miss
to
go
back
to
ghent
the
chaplain
has
a
moral
nerve
that
never
fails
him
then
torrence
says
that
she
is
going
back
to
protect
miss
and
ursula
dearmer
says
that
she
is
going
back
to
protect
torrence
and
somebody
down
in
the
blankets
remarks
that
the
thing
was
settled
last
night
and
that
all
this
going
back
is
simply
rotten
i
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
all
my
fault
and
that
therefore
if
torrence
goes
back
nobody
is
going
back
with
her
but
me
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
three
motor
ambulances
with
possibly
the
entire
corps
inside
them
certainly
with
the
five
women
and
the
chaplain
and
the
commandant
would
presently
have
been
seen
tearing
along
the
road
to
ghent
one
in
violent
pursuit
of
the
other
if
we
had
not
telephoned
and
received
news
of
miss
safe
arrival
at
the
flandria
and
orders
that
no
more
women
were
to
return
to
ghent
among
all
the
variously
assorted
anguish
of
that
halt
at
ecloo
the
figures
and
the
behaviour
of
and
her
husband
and
their
children
are
beautiful
to
remember
their
courtesy
their
serenity
their
gentle
and
absolving
wonder
that
anybody
should
see
anything
in
the
least
frightful
or
distressing
or
even
disconcerting
and
unusual
in
the
situation
the
little
girl
who
sat
beside
me
showing
me
her
of
animals
accepting
gravely
and
earnestly
all
that
you
had
to
tell
her
about
the
ways
of
squirrels
of
kangaroos
and
opossums
while
we
waited
for
the
ambulance
cars
to
take
us
to
bruges
the
boy
who
ran
after
us
as
we
went
and
stood
looking
after
us
and
waving
to
us
in
the
lane
the
aspect
of
that
flemish
house
and
garden
as
we
left
them
there
is
no
word
that
embraces
all
these
things
but
beauty
we
stopped
in
the
village
to
take
up
our
wounded
from
the
convent
the
nuns
brought
us
through
a
long
passage
and
across
a
little
court
to
the
refectory
which
had
been
turned
into
a
ward
bowls
steaming
with
the
morning
meal
for
the
patients
stood
on
narrow
tables
between
the
two
rows
of
beds
each
bed
was
hung
round
and
littered
with
haversacks
boots
rifles
bandoliers
and
uniforms
bloody
and
begrimed
except
for
the
figures
of
the
nuns
and
the
aspect
of
its
walls
and
its
atmosphere
of
incorruptible
peace
the
place
might
have
been
a
barracks
or
the
dormitory
in
a
night
lodging
rather
than
a
convent
ward
when
we
had
found
and
dressed
our
men
we
led
them
out
as
we
had
come
as
we
went
we
saw
framed
through
some
open
doorway
sunlight
and
vivid
green
and
the
high
walls
and
clipped
alleys
of
the
convent
garden
of
all
our
sad
contacts
and
separations
these
at
the
convents
were
the
saddest
and
it
was
not
only
that
this
place
had
the
same
poignant
and
unbearable
beauty
as
the
place
we
had
just
left
but
its
beauty
was
unique
you
felt
that
if
the
friends
you
had
just
left
were
turned
out
of
their
house
and
garden
they
might
still
return
some
day
but
here
you
saw
a
carefully
guarded
and
fragile
loveliness
on
the
very
eve
of
its
dissolution
the
place
was
fairly
saturated
with
holiness
and
the
beauty
of
holiness
was
in
the
faces
and
in
every
gesture
of
the
nuns
and
you
felt
that
they
and
their
faces
and
their
gestures
were
impermanent
that
this
highly
specialized
form
of
holiness
had
continued
with
difficulty
until
now
that
it
hung
by
a
single
thread
to
a
world
that
had
departed
very
far
from
it
yet
for
the
moment
while
you
looked
at
it
it
maintained
itself
in
perfection
we
shall
never
know
all
that
the
war
has
annihilated
but
for
that
moment
of
time
while
it
lasted
the
convent
at
ecloo
annihilated
the
nineteenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
every
century
between
now
and
the
fifteenth
what
you
saw
was
a
piece
of
life
cut
straight
out
of
the
middle
ages
what
you
felt
was
the
guarded
and
hidden
beauty
of
the
middle
ages
the
beauty
of
obedience
simplicity
and
chastity
of
souls
set
apart
and
dedicated
the
whole
insoluble
secret
charm
of
the
cloistered
life
the
very
horror
of
the
invasion
that
threatened
it
at
this
hour
of
the
twentieth
century
was
a
horror
of
the
middle
ages
but
these
devoted
women
did
not
seem
aware
of
it
the
little
english
nun
who
conducted
us
talked
politely
and
placidly
of
england
and
of
english
things
as
of
things
remembered
with
a
certain
mortal
affection
but
left
behind
without
regret
it
was
as
if
she
contemplated
the
eternal
continuance
of
the
convent
at
ecloo
with
no
break
in
its
divine
tranquillity
one
sister
went
so
far
as
to
express
the
hope
that
their
convent
would
be
spared
it
was
as
if
she
were
uttering
some
merely
perfunctory
piety
the
rest
without
ceasing
from
their
ministrations
looked
up
at
us
and
smiled
on
the
way
up
to
bruges
we
passed
whole
regiments
of
the
belgian
army
in
retreat
they
trooped
along
in
straggling
disorder
their
rifles
at
trail
behind
them
the
trudged
carrying
the
standard
furled
and
covered
with
black
the
speed
of
our
cars
as
we
overtook
them
was
more
insufferable
than
ever
we
thought
that
the
belgian
army
would
be
quartered
in
bruges
and
that
we
should
find
a
hospital
there
and
serve
the
army
from
that
base
we
took
our
wounded
to
the
convent
and
set
out
to
find
quarters
for
ourselves
in
the
town
we
had
orders
to
meet
at
the
convent
again
at
a
certain
hour
most
of
the
corps
were
being
put
up
at
the
convent
the
rest
of
us
had
to
look
for
rooms
in
the
search
i
got
separated
from
the
corps
and
wandered
about
the
streets
of
bruges
with
much
interest
and
a
sense
of
great
intimacy
and
leisure
by
the
time
i
had
found
a
in
a
narrow
street
behind
the
i
felt
it
to
be
quite
certain
that
we
should
stay
in
bruges
at
least
as
long
as
we
had
stayed
in
ghent
and
what
moments
i
could
spare
from
the
obsession
of
ghent
i
spent
in
contemplating
the
belfry
very
soon
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
the
convent
the
way
to
the
convent
was
through
many
tortuous
streets
but
i
was
going
in
the
right
direction
accompanied
by
a
kind
flamand
and
her
husband
when
at
the
turn
by
the
canal
bridge
i
was
nearly
run
over
by
one
of
our
own
ambulance
cars
it
was
bert
car
and
he
was
driving
with
fury
and
perturbation
away
from
the
convent
and
towards
the
town
janet
mcneil
was
with
him
they
stopped
to
tell
me
that
we
had
orders
to
clear
out
of
bruges
the
germans
had
taken
ghent
and
were
coming
on
to
bruges
we
had
orders
to
go
on
to
ostend
we
found
the
rest
of
the
cars
drawn
up
in
a
street
near
the
convent
we
had
not
been
two
hours
in
bruges
and
we
left
it
if
anything
quicker
than
we
had
come
in
the
flat
land
fairly
dropped
away
before
our
speed
i
sat
on
the
back
step
of
the
leading
car
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
those
ambulances
three
in
a
line
as
they
came
into
sight
scooting
round
the
turns
on
the
road
to
ostend
besides
the
wounded
we
had
brought
from
ghent
we
took
with
us
three
footsore
tommies
whom
we
had
picked
up
in
bruges
they
had
had
a
long
march
the
stoutest
biggest
and
most
robust
of
these
three
fainted
just
as
we
drew
up
in
the
courtyard
of
the
at
ostend
the
had
been
taken
by
some
english
and
american
women
and
turned
into
a
hospital
it
was
filled
already
to
overflowing
but
they
found
room
for
our
wounded
for
the
night
ostend
was
to
be
evacuated
in
the
morning
in
fact
we
were
considered
to
be
running
things
rather
fine
by
staying
here
instead
of
going
on
straight
to
dunkirk
it
was
supposed
that
if
the
germans
were
not
yet
in
bruges
they
might
be
there
any
minute
but
we
had
had
so
many
premature
orders
to
clear
out
and
the
germans
had
always
been
hours
behind
time
and
we
judged
it
a
safe
risk
besides
there
were
belgian
wounded
in
bruges
and
three
of
our
ambulance
cars
were
going
back
to
fetch
them
there
was
some
agitation
as
to
who
would
and
who
would
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
bruges
the
commandant
was
at
first
inclined
to
reject
his
secretary
as
unfit
but
if
you
take
him
the
right
way
he
is
fairly
tractable
and
i
managed
to
convince
him
that
nothing
but
going
back
to
bruges
could
make
up
for
my
failure
to
go
back
to
ghent
he
earned
my
everlasting
gratitude
by
giving
me
leave
as
for
torrence
she
had
no
difficulty
she
was
obviously
competent
then
just
as
i
was
congratulating
myself
that
the
shame
of
ecloo
was
to
be
wiped
out
to
say
nothing
of
that
ignominious
overthrow
at
melle
there
occurred
a
that
made
our
ambulance
conspicuous
among
the
many
ambulances
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hospital
we
had
reckoned
without
the
mistimed
chivalry
of
our
chauffeurs
they
had
all
even
tom
been
quite
pathetically
kind
and
gentle
during
and
ever
since
the
flight
from
ghent
i
remember
poor
newlands
coming
up
with
his
bottle
of
formamint
just
as
we
were
preparing
to
leave
ecloo
it
never
occurred
to
us
that
there
was
anything
ominous
in
this
mood
torrence
and
i
were
just
going
to
get
into
i
think
newlands
car
when
we
were
aware
of
newlands
standing
fixed
on
the
steps
of
the
hospital
looking
like
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
in
khaki
and
flatly
refusing
to
drive
his
car
into
bruges
not
only
if
we
were
in
his
car
but
if
one
woman
went
with
the
expedition
in
any
other
car
he
stood
there
very
upright
on
the
steps
of
the
hospital
and
rather
pale
while
the
commandant
and
torrence
surged
up
to
him
in
fury
the
commandant
told
him
he
would
be
sacked
for
insubordination
and
torrence
in
a
wild
flight
of
fancy
threatened
to
expose
him
in
the
papers
but
newlands
stood
his
ground
he
was
even
more
like
lord
kitchener
than
tom
he
simply
could
not
get
over
the
idea
that
women
were
to
be
protected
and
to
take
the
women
into
bruges
when
the
germans
were
for
all
we
knew
bruges
was
an
impossibility
to
newlands
as
it
would
have
been
to
lord
kitchener
so
he
went
on
refusing
to
take
his
car
into
bruges
if
one
woman
went
with
the
expedition
in
retort
to
a
charge
of
cold
feet
he
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
drive
into
any
hell
you
pleased
provided
he
had
got
to
take
any
women
with
him
he
care
if
he
sacked
he
did
care
if
torrence
report
him
in
the
papers
he
would
drive
his
car
into
bruges
if
one
woman
here
in
his
utter
disregard
of
all
discipline
the
likeness
between
newlands
and
lord
kitchener
ends
enough
that
he
drove
his
car
into
bruges
on
his
own
terms
and
torrence
and
i
were
left
behind
the
expedition
to
bruges
returned
safely
with
the
belgian
wounded
we
found
rooms
in
a
large
hotel
on
the
digue
overlooking
the
sea
before
evening
i
went
round
to
the
hospital
to
see
miss
three
wounded
men
the
is
built
in
terraces
and
galleries
going
all
round
the
front
and
side
of
it
i
took
the
wrong
turning
round
one
of
them
and
found
myself
in
the
doorway
of
an
immense
ward
from
somewhere
inside
there
came
loud
and
lacerating
screams
but
appallingly
monotonous
and
without
intervals
i
thought
it
was
a
man
in
delirium
i
even
thought
it
might
be
poor
fisher
of
whose
attacks
we
had
been
warned
i
went
in
i
had
barely
got
a
yard
inside
the
ward
before
a
kind
little
english
nurse
ran
up
to
me
i
told
her
what
i
wanted
she
said
you
better
go
back
you
wo
be
able
to
stand
it
even
then
i
did
take
it
in
and
said
i
supposed
the
poor
man
was
delirious
she
cried
out
no
no
he
is
having
his
leg
taken
off
they
had
run
short
of
anæsthetics
i
do
know
what
i
must
have
looked
like
but
the
little
nurse
grabbed
me
and
said
come
away
you
faint
if
you
see
it
and
i
went
away
somebody
took
me
into
the
right
ward
where
i
found
fisher
and
williams
and
the
other
man
fisher
was
none
the
worse
for
his
journey
and
williams
and
the
other
man
were
very
cheerful
another
english
nurse
who
must
have
had
the
tact
of
a
heavenly
angel
brought
up
a
bowl
of
chicken
broth
and
said
i
might
feed
fisher
if
i
liked
so
i
sat
a
little
while
there
feeding
fisher
and
regretting
for
the
hundredth
time
that
i
had
not
had
the
foresight
to
be
trained
as
a
nurse
when
i
was
young
unfortunately
though
i
foresaw
this
war
ten
years
ago
i
had
not
foreseen
it
when
i
was
young
i
told
the
men
i
would
come
and
see
them
early
in
the
morning
and
bring
them
some
money
as
i
had
promised
miss
i
never
saw
them
again
nothing
happened
quite
as
i
had
planned
it
to
begin
with
we
had
discovered
as
we
lunched
at
bruges
that
the
funds
remaining
in
the
leather
were
hardly
enough
to
keep
the
ambulance
going
for
another
week
and
our
hotel
expenses
at
ostend
were
reducing
its
term
to
a
problematic
three
days
so
it
was
more
or
less
settled
amongst
us
that
somebody
would
have
to
go
over
to
england
the
next
day
and
return
with
funds
and
that
the
supernumerary
secretary
was
on
the
whole
the
fittest
person
for
the
job
i
slept
peaceably
on
this
prospect
of
a
usefulness
that
seemed
to
justify
my
existence
at
a
moment
when
it
most
needed
vindication
i
got
up
at
six
last
thing
at
night
i
had
said
to
myself
that
i
must
wake
early
and
go
round
to
the
hospital
with
the
money
with
my
first
sleep
the
obsession
of
ghent
had
slackened
its
hold
and
though
it
came
back
again
after
i
had
got
up
dressed
and
had
realized
my
surroundings
its
returns
were
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
go
round
to
the
the
hospital
was
being
evacuated
the
wounded
were
lying
about
everywhere
on
the
terraces
and
galleries
waiting
for
the
ambulances
williams
and
fisher
and
the
other
man
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
was
told
that
their
ward
had
been
cleared
out
first
and
that
the
three
were
now
safe
on
their
way
to
england
i
went
away
very
grieved
that
they
had
not
got
their
money
at
the
hotel
i
find
the
commandant
very
cheerful
he
has
made
miss
his
secretary
and
reporter
till
my
return
he
goes
down
to
the
quay
to
make
arrangements
for
my
transport
and
returns
after
some
considerable
time
there
have
been
difficulties
about
this
detail
and
the
commandant
has
an
abhorrence
of
details
even
of
easy
ones
he
comes
back
he
looks
abstracted
i
inquire
a
little
too
anxiously
perhaps
about
my
transport
it
is
all
right
all
perfectly
right
he
has
arranged
with
beavis
of
the
british
field
hospital
to
take
me
on
his
ship
he
looks
a
little
spent
with
his
exertions
and
as
he
has
again
become
abstracted
i
forbear
to
press
for
more
information
at
the
moment
we
breakfasted
presently
i
ask
him
the
name
of
beavis
ship
oh
the
of
the
ship
is
the
time
passes
and
presently
just
as
he
is
going
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
me
to
know
what
time
the
sails
this
detail
either
he
never
knew
or
has
forgotten
and
there
is
something
about
it
about
the
nature
of
stated
times
as
about
all
things
conventional
and
mechanical
and
precise
that
peculiarly
exasperates
him
he
waves
both
hands
in
a
fury
of
nescience
and
cries
ask
me
another
by
a
sort
of
mutual
consent
we
assume
that
the
will
sail
with
beavis
at
ten
after
all
it
is
a
very
likely
hour
more
time
passes
finally
we
go
into
the
street
that
runs
along
the
digue
and
there
we
find
beavis
sitting
in
a
we
approach
him
i
thank
him
for
his
kindness
in
giving
me
transport
i
say
i
sure
his
ship
will
be
crowded
with
his
own
people
but
that
i
do
in
the
least
mind
standing
in
the
if
does
mind
taking
me
over
he
looks
at
me
with
a
dreamy
benevolence
mixed
with
amazement
he
would
take
me
over
with
pleasure
if
he
knew
how
he
was
to
get
away
himself
but
i
say
to
the
commandant
i
thought
you
had
arranged
with
beavis
to
take
me
on
the
the
commandant
says
nothing
and
beavis
smiles
again
a
smile
of
melancholy
knowledge
the
he
says
sailed
two
hours
ago
so
it
is
decided
that
i
am
to
proceed
with
the
ambulance
to
dunkirk
thence
by
train
to
boulogne
thence
to
folkestone
it
sounds
so
simple
that
i
wonder
why
we
did
think
of
it
before
but
it
was
not
by
any
means
so
simple
as
it
sounded
first
of
all
we
had
to
collect
ourselves
then
we
had
to
collect
hanson
luggage
hanson
was
one
of
clair
stobart
women
surgeons
and
she
had
left
her
luggage
for
miss
to
carry
from
ostend
to
england
there
was
a
yellow
tin
box
and
a
hanson
best
clothes
and
her
cases
of
surgical
instruments
were
in
the
and
all
the
things
she
did
particularly
care
about
in
the
tin
box
or
else
the
best
clothes
and
the
surgical
instruments
were
in
the
tin
box
and
the
things
she
did
particularly
care
about
in
the
as
we
were
certainly
going
to
take
both
boxes
it
did
seem
to
matter
much
which
way
round
it
was
then
there
was
foster
green
canvas
to
be
taken
to
folkestone
and
sent
to
him
at
the
victoria
hospital
there
and
there
was
a
british
red
cross
lady
and
her
luggage
but
we
know
anything
about
the
lady
and
her
luggage
yet
we
found
them
at
the
hospital
where
some
of
our
ambulances
were
waiting
by
this
time
the
courtyard
the
steps
and
terraces
of
the
hospital
were
a
scene
of
the
most
ghastly
confusion
the
wounded
were
still
being
carried
out
and
still
lay
wrapped
in
blankets
on
the
terraces
those
who
could
sit
or
stand
sat
or
stood
ambulance
cars
jostled
each
other
in
the
courtyard
red
cross
nurses
dressed
for
departure
were
grouped
despairingly
about
their
luggage
other
nurses
who
were
not
dressed
for
departure
who
still
remained
superintending
the
removal
of
their
wounded
paid
no
attention
to
these
groups
and
their
movements
and
their
cries
the
hospital
had
cast
off
all
care
for
any
but
its
wounded
women
seized
hold
of
other
women
for
guidance
and
instruction
and
received
none
nobody
was
rudely
shaken
off
they
were
all
in
fact
very
kind
to
each
other
but
nobody
had
time
or
ability
to
attend
to
anybody
else
somebody
seized
hold
of
the
commandant
and
sent
us
both
off
to
look
for
the
kitchen
and
for
a
sack
of
loaves
which
we
would
find
in
it
we
were
to
bring
the
sack
of
loaves
out
as
quickly
as
we
could
we
went
off
and
found
the
kitchen
we
found
several
kitchens
but
we
could
find
the
sack
of
loaves
and
had
to
go
back
without
it
when
we
got
back
the
lady
who
had
commandeered
the
sack
of
loaves
was
no
more
to
be
seen
on
the
terrace
while
we
waited
on
the
steps
somebody
remarked
that
there
was
a
german
aeroplane
in
the
sky
and
that
it
was
going
to
drop
a
bomb
there
was
it
was
sailing
high
over
the
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
it
dropped
its
bomb
right
in
front
of
us
above
an
enormous
building
not
fifty
yards
away
we
looked
fascinated
we
expected
to
see
the
building
knocked
to
bits
and
flying
in
all
directions
the
bomb
fell
and
nothing
happened
nothing
at
all
it
was
soon
after
the
bomb
that
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
lady
she
was
a
british
red
cross
nurse
stranded
with
a
and
a
green
canvas
trunk
and
most
particularly
forlorn
she
had
lost
her
friends
she
had
lost
her
equanimity
she
had
lost
everything
except
her
luggage
how
she
attached
herself
to
us
i
do
not
know
the
commandant
says
it
was
i
who
made
myself
responsible
for
her
safety
we
could
leave
her
to
the
germans
with
her
green
canvas
trunk
and
her
so
i
heaved
up
one
end
of
the
canvas
trunk
and
the
commandant
tore
it
from
me
and
flung
it
to
the
chauffeurs
who
got
it
and
the
into
bert
ambulance
i
grasped
the
british
red
cross
lady
firmly
by
the
arm
lest
she
should
get
adrift
again
and
hustled
her
along
to
the
hotel
where
the
yellow
tin
box
and
the
and
the
waited
somebody
got
them
into
the
ambulance
somehow
it
was
at
this
point
that
ursula
dearmer
appeared
she
had
put
up
at
some
other
hotel
with
mrs
lambert
my
british
red
cross
lady
was
explaining
to
me
that
she
had
by
no
means
abandoned
her
post
but
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
in
leaving
ostend
seeing
that
she
meant
to
apply
for
another
post
on
a
hospital
ship
she
was
sure
she
said
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
i
said
as
i
towed
her
securely
along
by
one
hand
through
a
gathering
crowd
of
refugees
we
were
now
making
for
the
ambulance
cars
that
were
drawn
up
along
the
street
by
the
digue
i
said
i
was
equally
sure
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
and
that
nobody
could
possibly
think
otherwise
and
as
i
say
ursula
dearmer
appeared
the
youngest
but
one
was
seated
with
riley
in
the
military
that
was
to
be
our
convoy
to
dunkirk
i
do
not
know
how
it
had
happened
but
in
this
hour
at
any
rate
she
had
taken
over
the
entire
control
and
command
of
the
ambulance
and
this
with
a
coolness
and
competence
that
suggested
that
it
was
no
new
thing
it
suggested
also
that
without
her
we
should
not
have
got
away
from
ostend
before
the
germans
marched
into
it
in
fact
it
is
hardly
fair
to
say
that
she
had
taken
everything
over
everything
had
lapsed
into
her
hands
at
the
supreme
crisis
by
a
sort
of
natural
fitness
we
were
all
ready
to
go
the
only
one
we
yet
waited
for
was
the
commandant
who
presently
emerged
from
the
hotel
in
his
still
dreamy
and
abstracted
movements
he
was
pursued
by
an
excited
waiter
flourishing
a
bill
i
forgot
whose
bill
it
was
it
may
have
been
mine
but
anyhow
it
was
bill
we
may
have
thought
we
were
following
the
retreat
of
the
belgian
army
when
we
went
from
ghent
to
bruges
we
were
in
fact
miles
behind
it
and
the
regiments
we
overtook
were
stragglers
the
whole
of
the
belgian
army
seemed
to
be
poured
out
on
to
that
road
between
ostend
and
dunkirk
sometimes
it
was
going
before
us
sometimes
it
was
mysteriously
coming
towards
us
sometimes
it
was
stationary
but
always
it
was
there
it
covered
the
roads
we
had
to
cut
our
way
through
it
it
was
retreating
slowly
as
if
in
leisure
with
a
firm
unhasting
dignity
every
now
and
then
as
we
looked
at
the
men
they
smiled
at
us
with
a
curious
still
and
tragic
smile
and
it
is
by
that
smile
that
i
shall
always
remember
the
look
of
the
belgian
army
in
the
great
retreat
our
own
retreat
the
bit
of
it
is
memorable
chiefly
by
miss
account
of
the
siege
of
antwerp
and
the
splendid
courage
of
clair
stobart
and
her
women
but
that
is
her
story
not
mine
and
it
should
be
left
to
her
to
tell
at
dunkirk
the
question
of
the
secretary
transport
again
arose
it
contended
feebly
with
the
larger
problem
of
where
and
when
and
how
the
corps
was
to
lunch
things
being
further
complicated
by
the
impending
interview
with
baron
de
broqueville
the
belgian
minister
of
war
i
began
to
feel
like
a
large
and
useless
parcel
which
the
commandant
had
brought
with
him
in
sheer
absence
of
mind
and
was
now
anxious
to
lose
or
otherwise
get
rid
of
at
the
same
time
the
ambulance
could
not
go
on
for
more
than
three
days
without
further
funds
and
as
the
courier
to
be
despatched
to
fetch
them
i
was
for
the
moment
the
most
important
person
in
the
corps
and
my
transport
was
not
a
question
to
be
lightly
set
aside
i
was
about
to
solve
the
problem
for
myself
by
lugging
my
lady
to
the
railway
station
when
ursula
dearmer
took
us
over
too
in
her
stride
as
inconsiderable
items
of
the
business
before
her
i
have
nothing
but
admiration
for
her
handling
of
it
we
halted
in
the
main
street
of
dunkirk
while
riley
and
the
chauffeurs
unearthed
from
the
my
and
and
the
british
red
cross
lady
and
trunk
and
and
hanson
with
her
best
clothes
and
her
surgical
instruments
and
the
tin
no
not
the
tin
box
for
the
commandant
now
possessed
by
a
violent
demon
of
hurry
resisted
our
efforts
to
drag
it
from
its
lair
all
these
things
were
piled
on
ursula
dearmer
military
the
british
red
cross
lady
almost
incredulous
of
her
good
luck
and
i
got
inside
it
and
ursula
dearmer
and
riley
drove
us
to
the
railway
station
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
a
train
was
to
leave
for
boulogne
either
a
little
before
or
a
little
after
one
and
we
had
time
to
catch
it
there
was
a
long
line
of
refugee
drawn
up
before
the
station
doors
and
i
noticed
that
every
one
of
them
carried
in
his
hand
a
slip
of
paper
ursula
dearmer
hailed
a
porter
who
she
said
would
look
after
us
like
a
father
with
a
matchless
celerity
he
and
riley
tore
down
the
pile
of
luggage
the
porter
put
them
on
a
barrow
and
disappeared
with
them
very
swiftly
through
the
station
doors
at
least
i
suppose
it
was
through
the
doors
all
we
knew
was
that
he
disappeared
then
ursula
dearmer
handed
over
to
me
three
cables
to
be
sent
from
dunkirk
i
said
to
her
and
riley
they
got
back
into
the
and
they
too
very
swiftly
disappeared
riley
went
away
bearing
with
him
the
baffling
mystery
of
his
personality
after
nearly
three
weeks
association
with
him
i
know
that
riley
whole
heart
is
in
his
job
of
carrying
the
wounded
beyond
that
i
know
no
more
of
him
than
on
the
day
when
he
first
turned
up
before
our
committee
but
with
ursula
dearmer
it
is
different
before
the
committee
she
appeared
as
a
very
young
girl
docile
diffident
only
and
of
dubious
efficiency
i
remember
my
solemn
pledges
to
her
mother
that
ursula
dearmer
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
into
danger
and
how
if
danger
insisted
on
coming
to
her
she
should
be
violently
packed
up
and
sent
home
i
remember
thinking
what
a
nuisance
ursula
dearmer
will
be
and
how
when
things
are
just
beginning
to
get
interesting
i
shall
be
told
off
to
see
her
home
and
ursula
dearmer
the
youngest
but
one
has
gone
not
at
all
docilely
and
diffidently
into
the
greatest
possible
danger
and
come
out
of
it
and
here
she
is
wide
awake
and
in
full
command
of
the
expedition
and
instead
of
my
seeing
her
off
and
all
the
way
home
she
is
very
thoroughly
and
competently
seeing
off
at
least
this
was
her
beautiful
intention
but
getting
out
of
france
in
is
not
a
simple
matter
when
we
tried
to
follow
the
flight
of
our
luggage
through
the
station
door
we
were
stopped
by
a
sentry
with
a
rifle
we
produced
our
passports
they
were
not
enough
at
the
sight
of
us
brought
to
halt
there
all
the
refugees
began
to
agitate
their
slips
of
paper
and
on
the
slips
we
read
the
words
my
british
red
cross
lady
had
no
i
had
only
my
sixteenth
part
in
the
of
the
corps
and
that
hidden
away
in
the
commandant
was
a
part
either
of
the
or
of
the
interview
with
the
belgian
minister
of
war
we
could
get
military
passes
for
military
passes
take
time
and
the
train
was
due
in
about
fifteen
minutes
and
the
fatherly
porter
had
vanished
taking
with
him
the
secret
of
our
luggage
it
was
a
fatherly
old
french
gentleman
who
advised
us
to
go
to
the
british
and
it
was
a
fatherly
old
french
who
drove
us
there
or
rather
who
drove
us
through
interminable
twisted
streets
and
into
blind
alleys
and
out
of
them
till
we
got
there
as
for
our
luggage
we
renounced
it
and
foster
and
luggage
in
the
interests
of
our
own
safety
at
last
we
got
to
the
british
only
i
think
the
took
us
to
the
town
hall
and
the
hospital
and
the
british
embassy
and
the
admiralty
offices
first
at
intervals
during
this
transit
the
british
red
cross
lady
explained
again
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
in
leaving
ostend
it
was
as
if
she
was
leaving
her
post
she
was
going
on
a
hospital
ship
she
was
sure
she
had
done
the
right
thing
it
was
not
for
me
to
be
unsympathetic
to
an
obsession
produced
by
a
retreat
so
i
assured
her
again
and
again
that
if
there
ever
was
a
right
thing
she
had
done
it
my
heart
bled
for
this
poor
lady
abandoned
by
the
organization
that
had
brought
her
out
in
the
courtyard
of
the
we
met
a
stalwart
man
in
khaki
who
smiled
as
a
god
might
smile
at
our
trouble
and
asked
us
why
on
earth
we
had
got
a
passage
on
the
naval
transport
sailing
at
three
we
said
nothing
would
have
pleased
us
better
only
we
had
never
heard
of
the
and
her
sailing
and
he
took
us
to
the
consul
and
the
consul
who
must
have
been
buried
alive
in
detail
gave
us
a
letter
to
captain
king
of
the
and
the
drove
us
to
the
dock
captain
king
was
an
angel
he
was
the
head
of
a
whole
hierarchy
of
angels
who
called
themselves
ship
officers
there
is
no
difficulty
about
our
transport
but
we
must
be
at
the
docks
by
two
we
have
an
hour
before
us
so
we
drive
back
to
the
station
to
see
if
after
all
we
can
find
that
luggage
not
that
we
in
the
least
expected
to
find
it
for
we
had
been
told
that
it
had
gone
on
by
the
train
to
boulogne
now
the
british
red
cross
lady
declared
many
times
that
but
for
me
and
my
mastery
of
the
french
language
she
would
never
have
got
out
of
dunkirk
and
it
was
true
that
i
looked
on
her
more
as
a
sacred
charge
than
as
a
valuable
ally
in
the
struggle
with
french
sentries
porters
and
officials
as
for
the
i
did
consider
him
valuable
at
all
even
as
the
driver
of
an
ancient
and
yet
it
was
the
lady
and
the
who
found
the
luggage
it
seems
that
the
station
hall
is
open
between
trains
and
they
had
simply
gone
into
the
hall
and
seen
it
there
withdrawn
bashfully
into
a
corner
the
face
as
he
announces
his
discovery
makes
the
war
seem
a
monstrous
illusion
it
is
incredible
that
anything
so
joyous
should
exist
in
a
country
under
german
invasion
we
drive
again
to
the
in
her
dock
the
stewards
run
about
and
do
things
for
us
they
give
us
lunch
they
give
us
tea
and
the
other
officers
come
in
and
make
large
simple
jokes
about
bombs
and
mines
and
submarines
we
have
the
ship
all
to
ourselves
except
for
a
few
british
soldiers
recruits
sent
out
to
antwerp
too
soon
and
sent
back
again
for
more
training
they
looked
poor
boys
far
sadder
than
the
belgian
army
and
i
walk
the
decks
i
walk
the
decks
till
we
get
to
dover
my
sacred
charge
appears
and
disappears
every
now
and
then
i
see
her
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
ship
officers
and
i
wonder
whether
she
is
telling
them
that
she
has
not
really
left
her
post
and
that
she
is
sure
she
has
done
right
i
am
no
longer
concerned
about
my
own
post
for
i
feel
so
sure
that
i
am
going
back
to
it
i
shall
get
the
money
from
our
committee
and
on
thursday
i
shall
go
back
and
yet
and
yet
i
must
have
had
a
premonition
we
are
approaching
england
i
can
see
the
white
cliffs
and
i
hate
the
white
cliffs
i
hate
them
with
a
sudden
and
mysterious
hatred
more
especially
i
hate
the
cliffs
of
dover
for
it
is
there
that
we
must
land
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
to
hate
the
white
coast
of
my
own
country
when
she
is
at
war
and
now
i
know
that
i
hate
it
because
it
is
not
the
coast
of
flanders
which
would
be
absurd
if
i
were
really
going
back
again
yes
i
must
have
had
a
premonition
we
have
landed
now
i
have
said
to
captain
king
and
all
the
ship
officers
and
thanked
them
for
their
kindness
i
have
said
to
the
british
red
cross
lady
who
is
not
going
to
london
and
i
go
to
the
station
to
send
off
five
wires
i
am
sending
off
the
five
wires
when
i
hear
feet
returning
through
the
station
hall
the
red
cross
lady
is
back
again
she
is
saying
this
time
that
she
is
sure
she
has
done
the
right
thing
and
again
i
assure
her
that
she
has
well
there
are
obsessions
and
obsessions
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
done
the
right
thing
or
not
in
leaving
flanders
or
for
that
matter
in
leaving
ghent
all
that
i
know
is
that
i
love
it
and
that
i
have
left
it
and
that
i
want
to
go
back
postscript
there
have
been
changes
in
that
motor
field
ambulance
corps
that
set
out
for
flanders
on
the
of
september
its
commandant
has
gone
from
it
to
join
the
royal
army
medical
corps
a
few
of
the
original
volunteers
have
dropped
out
and
others
have
taken
their
places
and
it
is
larger
now
than
it
was
and
better
organized
but
whoever
went
and
whoever
stayed
its
four
have
remained
at
the
front
two
of
them
are
attached
to
the
third
division
of
the
belgian
army
all
four
have
distinguished
themselves
by
their
devotion
to
that
army
and
by
their
valour
and
they
have
all
received
the
order
of
leopold
the
highest
belgian
honour
ever
given
to
women
the
commandant
being
a
man
has
the
order
of
leopold
and
philip
gibbs
and
souttar
have
described
his
heroic
action
at
the
battle
of
dixmude
on
the
of
october
when
he
went
into
the
cellars
of
the
burning
and
toppling
town
hall
to
rescue
the
wounded
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
whole
corps
old
volunteers
and
new
has
covered
itself
with
glory
on
our
two
chauffeurs
tom
and
bert
the
glory
lies
quite
thick
tom
if
i
may
quote
from
my
own
story
of
the
chauffeurs
tom
was
in
the
battle
of
dixmude
at
the
order
of
his
commandant
he
drove
his
car
straight
into
the
thick
of
it
over
the
ruins
of
a
shattered
house
that
blocked
the
way
he
waited
with
his
car
while
all
the
bombs
that
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
crashed
around
him
and
houses
flamed
and
tottered
and
fell
warm
ai
it
was
tom
comment
four
days
later
he
was
waiting
at
oudekappele
with
his
car
when
he
heard
that
the
hospital
of
at
dixmude
was
being
shelled
and
that
the
belgian
military
man
who
had
been
sent
with
a
to
carry
off
the
wounded
had
been
turned
back
by
the
fragment
of
a
shell
that
dropped
in
front
of
him
tom
thereupon
drove
into
dixmude
to
the
hospital
of
and
removed
from
it
two
wounded
soldiers
and
two
aged
and
paralysed
civilians
who
had
sheltered
there
and
brought
them
to
furnes
the
military
ambulance
men
then
followed
his
lead
and
the
hospital
was
emptied
that
evening
it
was
destroyed
by
a
shell
and
bert
it
was
bert
who
drove
his
ambulance
into
to
the
barricade
by
the
railway
it
was
bert
who
searched
in
a
to
pick
out
three
wounded
from
among
thirteen
dead
who
with
the
help
of
a
belgian
priest
carried
the
three
several
yards
to
his
car
under
fire
and
who
brought
them
in
safety
to
furnes
and
the
others
the
brave
chaplain
and
riley
and
lambert
have
also
proved
themselves
but
when
i
think
of
the
corps
it
is
chiefly
of
the
four
that
i
think
the
two
women
of
pervyse
and
the
other
two
who
joined
them
at
their
dangerous
both
at
furnes
and
pervyse
they
worked
all
night
looking
after
their
wounded
sometimes
sleeping
on
straw
in
a
room
shared
by
the
belgian
troops
when
there
was
no
other
shelter
for
them
in
the
bombarded
town
one
of
them
has
driven
a
heavy
ambulance
car
in
a
night
along
a
road
raked
by
and
broken
here
and
there
into
great
pits
to
fetch
a
load
of
wounded
a
performance
that
would
have
racked
the
nerves
of
any
male
chauffeur
ever
born
she
has
driven
the
same
car
with
five
german
prisoners
for
her
passengers
the
four
women
served
at
pervyse
the
town
nearest
to
the
in
torrence
a
cellar
only
twenty
yards
behind
the
belgian
trenches
in
that
cellar
eight
feet
square
and
lighted
and
ventilated
only
by
a
slit
in
the
wall
two
lived
for
three
weeks
sleeping
on
straw
eating
what
they
could
get
drinking
water
that
had
passed
through
a
cemetery
where
nine
hundred
germans
are
buried
they
had
to
burn
candles
night
and
day
here
the
wounded
were
brought
as
they
fell
in
the
trenches
and
were
tended
until
the
ambulance
came
to
take
them
to
the
base
hospital
at
furnes
day
in
day
out
and
all
night
long
with
barely
an
interval
for
a
wash
or
a
change
of
clothing
the
women
stayed
on
the
two

the
four
often

the
engineers
built
them
a
little
hut
for

them

their
little
hut
this
is

what
they

never

solitary

i
am
puzzled
about
this
date
it
stands
in
my
ambulance
as
saturday
with
a
note
that
the
british
came
into
ghent
on
their
way
to
antwerp
on
the
evening
of
that
day
now
i
believe
there
were
no
british
in
antwerp
before
the
evening
of
sunday
the
yet
wilson
and
davidson
going
into
saint
nicolas
before
us
saw
the
british
there
and
torrence
and
janet
mcneil
saw
more
british
come
into
ghent
in
the
evening
i
was
ill
with
fever
the
day
after
the
run
into
antwerp
and
got
behindhand
with
my
so
it
seems
safest
to
assume
that
i
made
a
wrong
entry
and
that
we
went
into
antwerp
on
sunday
and
to
record
saturday
events
as
spreading
over
the
whole
day
similarly
the
events
that
the
attributes
to
monday
must
have
belonged
to
tuesday
and
if
tuesday
events
were
really
wednesday
that
clears
up
a
painful
doubt
i
had
as
to
wednesday
which
came
into
my
as
an
empty
extra
which
i
could
account
for
in
any
way
there
i
was
with
a
day
left
over
and
nothing
to

his

hired

gone
out
