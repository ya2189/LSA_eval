a

fear
reigned
in
the
house
of
vishnu
the
fisherman
for
but
a
week
before
his
wife
chandra
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
child
who
survived
his
mother
but
a
few
hours
and
during
those
seven
days
all
the
elders
and
the
wise
women
of
the
community
came
one
after
another
unto
vishnu
and
impressing
upon
him
the
malignant
influence
of
such
untimely
deaths
bade
him
for
the
sake
of
himself
and
his
family
do
all
in
his
power
to
lay
the
spirit
of
his
dead
wife
so
on
a
certain
night
early
in
december
vishnu
called
all
his
into
the
room
where
chandra
had
died
having
first
arranged
there
a
brass
salver
containing
a
ball
of
flour
loosely
encased
in
thread
a
miniature
cot
with
the
legs
fashioned
out
of
the
berries
of
the
bhendi
and
several
small
silver
rings
and
bangles
a
coral
necklace
and
a
quaint
silver
chain
which
were
destined
to
be
hung
in
due
season
upon
the
wooden
peg
symbolical
of
his
dead
wife
spirit
in
the
devaghar
or
gods
room
of
his
house
and
he
called
thither
also
rama
the
gondhali
master
of
occult
ceremonies
vishram
his
disciple
and
krishna
the
bhagat
or
medium
who
is
beloved
of
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
and
often
bears
their
messages
unto
the
living
when
all
are
assembled
the
women
of
the
community
raise
the
brass
salver
and
head
a
procession
to
the
seashore
none
being
left
in
the
dead
room
save
krishna
the
medium
who
sits
motionless
in
the
centre
thereof
and
on
the
dry
shingle
the
women
place
the
salver
and
two
brass
lotas
filled
with
milk
and
water
while
the
company
ranges
itself
in
a
around
rama
the
gondhali
squatting
directly
in
front
of
the
platter
for
a
moment
he
sits
wrapped
in
thought
and
then
commences
a
weird
chant
of
invocation
to
the
spirit
of
the
dead
woman
during
which
her
relations
in
turn
drop
a
copper
coin
into
the
salver
chandrabai
he
wails
take
this
thy
husband
gift
of
sorrow
and
as
the
company
echoes
his
lament
vishnu
rises
and
drops
his
coin
into
the
plate
then
her
four
brothers
drop
a
coin
apiece
her
whispering
it
is
for
food
does
likewise
also
her
mother
with
the
words
choli
patal
or
tis
a
robe
and
bodice
for
thee
and
so
on
until
all
the
relatives
have
cast
down
their
offerings
one
promising
a
fair
couch
another
an
umbrella
a
third
a
pair
of
shoes
and
little
moti
the
dead
woman
eldest
child
a
pair
of
bangles
for
my
mother
until
in
truth
all
the
small
luxuries
that
the
dead
woman
may
require
in
the
life
beyond
have
been
granted
meanwhile
the
strange
invocation
proceeds
all
the
dead
ancestors
of
the
family
who
are
represented
by
the
quaint
in
the
gods
room
of
home
are
solemnly
addressed
and
besought
to
receive
the
dead
woman
in
kindly
fashion
and
as
each
copper
coin
tinkles
in
the
salver
rama
cries
receive
this
chandrabai
and
hie
thee
to
thy
last
when
the
last
offering
has
been
made
the
women
again
raise
the
salver
and
the
party
fares
back
to
vishnu
house
where
a
rude
shrine
of
satvai
the
sixth
mother
has
been
prepared
for
whispers
our
guide
chandrabai
died
without
worshipping
satvai
and
her
spirit
must
perforce
fulfil
those
rites
close
to
the
shrine
sits
a
midwife
keeping
guard
over
a
new
gauze
cloth
a
sari
and
a
bodice
purchased
for
the
spirit
of
chandrabai
and
on
a
plate
close
at
hand
are
vermilion
for
her
brow
antimony
for
her
eyes
a
a
comb
bangles
and
sweetmeats
such
as
she
liked
during
her
when
the
shrine
is
reached
one
of
the
brothers
steps
forward
with
a
the
edge
of
which
is
plastered
with
ghi
and
supports
a
lighted
wick
and
as
he
steps
up
to
the
shrine
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
deceased
again
press
forward
and
place
offerings
of
fruit
and
flowers
in
the
fan
there
he
stands
holding
the
gifts
towards
the
amorphous
simulacrum
of
the
primeval
mother
while
rama
the
hierophant
beseeches
her
to
send
the
spirit
of
the
dead
chandrabai
into
the
and
lo
on
a
sudden
the
ghostly
flame
on
the
lip
of
the
fan
dies
out
the
spirit
of
chandrabai
has
come
straightway
rama
seizes
the
fan
and
followed
by
the
rest
dashes
into
the
room
where
krishna
the
medium
is
still
sitting
four
or
five
men
commence
a
wild
refrain
to
the
accompaniment
of
brazen
cymbals
and
rama
passes
the
containing
the
dead
spirit
over
the
head
of
the
medium
let
the
spirit
appear
shrieks
rama
amid
the
clashing
of
the
cymbals
let
the
spirit
appear
he
cries
as
he
blows
a
cloud
of
incense
into
krishna
face
the
medium
quivers
like
an
aspen
leaf
the
dead
brothers
crawl
forward
and
lay
their
foreheads
upon
his
feet
he
shakes
more
violently
as
the
spirit
takes
firmer
hold
upon
him
and
then
with
a
wild
shriek
he
rolls
upon
the
ground
and
lies
rent
with
paroxysms
his
face
stretched
upwards
to
the
louder
and
louder
crash
the
cymbals
louder
rises
the
chant
who
art
thou
cries
rama
i
am
chandrabai
comes
the
answer
hast
thou
any
wish
unfulfilled
asks
the
midwife
nay
all
my
wishes
have
been
met
cries
the
spirit
through
the
lips
of
the
medium
i
am
in
very
truth
chandrabai
who
was
but
am
not
now
of
this
world
as
the
last
words
die
away
the
men
dash
forward
twist
krishna
hair
into
a
knot
behind
dress
him
as
he
struggles
in
the
female
attire
which
the
midwife
has
been
guarding
and
place
in
his
hand
a
wooden
slab
rudely
carved
into
the
semblance
of
a
woman
and
child
away
away
to
the
underworld
chant
the
singers
and
at
the
command
krishna
wrenches
himself
free
from
the
men
who
are
holding
him
and
dashes
out
with
a
yell
into
the
night
straight
as
an
arrow
he
heads
for
the
seashore
his
hands
clutching
the
air
convulsively
his
streaming
in
the
and
behind
like
hounds
on
the
trail
of
the
deer
come
rama
the
brethren
the
sisters
and
rest
of
the
community
over
the
shingle
they
stream
and
down
on
to
the
hard
wet
sand
some
one
digs
a
hole
another
produces
a
black
cock
and
rama
with
a
knife
cuts
its
throat
over
the
hole
imploring
the
departure
at
the
very
moment
that
krishna
with
a
final
shriek
plunges
into
the
sea
they
follow
him
carry
him
out
of
danger
and
lay
him
stark
and
speechless
upon
the
margin
of
the
waves
thence
after
a
pause
and
a
final
prayer
they
bear
him
homeward
as
men
bear
a
corpse
nor
leave
him
until
he
has
regained
consciousness
and
his
very
self
for
with
that
last
shrill
cry
the
ghost
of
chandrabai
fled
across
the
waste
waters
to
meet
the
pale
ancestral
dead
and
dwell
with
them
for
evermore
and
the
house
of
vishnu
the
fisherman
was
freed
from
the
curse
of
her
vagrant
and
unpropitiated
spirit
she
has
never
troubled
me
since
that
day
says
vishnu
but
at
times
when
i
am
out
in
my
and
the
wind
blows
softly
from
the
west
i
hear
her
voice
calling
to
me
across
the
waters
and
one
day
if
the
gods
are
kind
i
shall
sail
westward

by

sleep

annas

barely
has
his
voice
died
away
than
the
muezzin
call
to
prayer
falls
on
the
ear
of
the
sleeper
arouses
in
his
heart
thoughts
of
the
past
glory
of
his
faith

forces
him
from

couch
to
wash
and
bend
in
prayer

him

fainteth
not
whom
neither
sleep
nor
fatigue
overtaketh
during

hot
months

the

the
closeness
of

many
a

to
shoulder

in
the
comparative
quiet
of
the
streets
by
night
that
one
hears
more
distinctly
the
sounds
in
the
houses
here
rises
the
bright
note
of
the
shadi
or
luck
songs
with
which
during
the
livelong
night
the
women
of
the
house
dispel
the
evil
influences
that
gather
around
a
birth
a
circumcision
or
a
bismillah
ceremony
there
one
catches
the
passionate
outcry
of
the
husband
vainly
trying
to
pierce
the
deaf
ear
of
death
for
life
in
the
city
has
hardened
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
and
has
led
them
to
forget
the
kindly
injunction
of
the
prophet
still
observed
in
small
towns
or
villages
neither
shall
the
merry
songs
of
birth
or
of
marriage
deepen
the
sorrow
of
a
bereaved
brother
the
last
sound
that
reaches
you
as
you
turn
homewards
is
the
appeal
of
the
sawale
or
begging
fakir
for
a
hundred
rupees
to
help
him
on
his
pilgrimage
all
night
long
he
tramps
through
the
darkness
stopping
every
twenty
or
thirty
paces
to
deliver
his
sonorous
prayer
for
help
nor
ceases
until
the
muezzin
voices
the
summons
to
morning
prayer
he
is
the
last
person
you
see
this
strange
and
portionless
darwesh
of
the
shadows
and
long
after
he
has
passed
from

you
hear

monotonous

there
are
certain
clubs
in
the
city
where
a
man
may
purchase
nightly
oblivion
for
the
modest
sum
of
two
or
three
annas
and
hither
come
regularly
like
homing
pigeons
at
nightfall
the
human
flotsam

jetsam

the
tide
of

tosses
into

in

squalid
lane

looks
out
upon
the
traffic
of
one
of
the
most
crowded
thoroughfares

if
you
will
for
some
sign
of

in
the
dark
ungarnished
house
which
towers
above
you
all
is
hushed
in
silence
no
voice
no
cry
from
within
reaches
the
ear
the
chal
must
be
tenanted
only
by
the
shadows
not
so
at
the
far
end
of
a
passage
into
which
the

water
drips
forming
pools
a
greasy
curtain

lifted

down
the
passage
push
aside
the
curtain
with
your
stick
it
is
far
too
foul
to
touch
with
the
hand
and
the
mystery
is
made
plain
the
room
with
its
shutters
and
walls
is
filled
with
recumbent
men
in
various
stages
of
all
sunk
in
the
sleep
which
the
and
the
little
black
pellets
of
opium
ensure
the
room
is
not
a
large
one
for
the
habitual
smoker
prefers
a
small
apartment
in
which
the
fumes
of
the
drug
hang
about
easily
and
its
reeking
walls
are
unadorned
save
with
a
chromo
plan
of
the
chief
buildings
at
mecca
a
crude
portrait
of
a
hindu
goddess
and
oleographs
of
british
royalty
it
were
all
the

these
were
absent

those
which
the
drugged
brain
fashions
and
cares
not

or
sovereignty
the
proprietor
of
the
club
may
be
a
musalman
his
patrons
may
be

the
dreams
which
riot
across

of

the
smokers
lie
all
over
the
room
in
groups
of
four
or
five
each
of
whom
is
provided
with
a
little
wooden
and
lies
curled
up
like
a
tired
dog
with
his
face
towards
the
lamp
in
the
centre
of
the
group
in
his
hand
is
the
pipe
the
bowl
of
which
reminds
one
of
the
cheap
china
used
in
native
offices
and
close
by
lies
the
long
thin
needle
which
from
time
to
time
he
dips
in
the
saucer
of
and
holds
in
the
flame
until
the
juice
frizzles
into
a
tiny
pellet
fit
for
insertion
in

the

is
heavy
with
vapour
that
clutches
at
the
throat
for
every
cranny
and
interstice
is
covered
with
fragments
of
old
sacking
defying
the
passage
of
the
night
air
as
you
turn
towards
the
door
a
fat
mughal
rises
slowly
from
the
ground
and
makes
obeisance
saying
that
he
is
the
proprietor
your
club
seems
to
pay
is
it
always
as
well
patronised
as
it
is
this
evening
aye
always
comes
the
sleepy
answer
for
my
opium
is
good
the
daily
subscription
but
small
and
there
be
many
whom
trouble
and
sorrow
have
taught
the
road
to
peace
they
come
hither
daily
about
sundown
and
dream
till
and
again
set
forth
upon
their
day
work
but
they
return
they
always
return
until
sonapur
claims
them
they
are
of
all
kinds
my
customers
there
mark
you
is
a
sikh
embroiderer
from
lahore
here
is
a
mahomedan
fitter
from
the
railway
this
one
keeps
a
tea
shop
in
the
nall
bazaar
that
one
is
a
pedlar
and
him
you
see
smiling
in
his
sleep
he
is
a
seaman
just
arrived
from
a
long
voyage
you
hazard
the
question
whether
any
of
the
customers
ever
die
in
this
paradise
of
dreams
and
the
answer
comes
not
often
for
they
that
smoke
opium
are
immune
from
plague
and
other
sudden
diseases
but
the
parrot
which
you
see
in
the
cage
overhead
was
left
to
me
by
one
who
died
just
where
the
saheb
now
stands
he
was
a
merchant
of
some
status
and
used
to
travel
to
singapore
and
south
africa
before
he
came
here
but
once
after
a
longer
journey
than
usual
he
returned
to
find
that
his
only
son
had
died
of
the
plague
and
that
his
wife
had
forgotten
him
for
another
therefore
he
cast
aside
his
business
and
came
hither
in
quest
of
forgetfulness
here
he
daily
smoked
until
his
money
was
spent
and
then
one
night
he
died
quietly
leaving
me
the
parrot
you
peer
up
through
the
fumes
and
discern
one
bright
black
eye
fixed
upon
you
half
in
anger
half
in
inquiry
the
bird
plumage
is
soiled
and
but
the
eye
is
clear
wickedly
clear
suggesting
that
its
owner
is
the
one
creature
in
this
languid
atmosphere
that
never
sleeps
what
stories
it
could
tell
if
it
could
but
of
sorrow
stories
of
evil
tales
of
the
little
kindnesses
which
the
freemasonry
of
the
teaches
men
to
do
unto
one
another
but
as
if
it
shunned
inquiry
it
retreats
to
the
back
of
its
perch
and
drops
a
film
over
its
eye
just
as
the
shutters
in
the
consciousness
of
those
over
whom
it
mounts
guard
further
down
the
indescribable
passage
is
a
similar
room
the
occupants
of
which
are
engaged
in
a
novel
game
two
men
squat
against
the
wall
on
either
side
surrounded
by
their
adherents
each
holding
between
his
knees
a
pipe
built
somewhat
on
the
german
fashion
into
the
bowls
they
push
at
intervals
a
round
ball
of
lighted
opium
or
some
other
drug
and
then
after
a
long
pull
blow
with
all
the
force
of
their
lungs
down
the
stem
so
that
the
lighted
ball
leaps
forth
in
the
direction
of
the
adversary
the
game
is
to
make
seven
points
by
hitting
the
adversary
as
many
times
and
he
who
wins
receives
the
exiguous
stakes
for
which
they
play
what
do
you
call
this
game
you
ask
and
an
obvious
sidi
in
the
corner
replies

japanese
winning
the
game
moves
very
slowly
for
both
the
players
and
onlookers
are
in
a
condition
of
but
the
interest
which
they
take
in
an
occasional
coup
is
by
no
means
feigned
and
is
perhaps
natural
to
people
whose
daily
lives
are
fraught
with
little
joy
round
the
corner
lies
a
third
room
or
club
likewise
filled
with
starved
and
sleepy
humanity
near
the
door
squats
a
figure
without
arms
who
can
scratch
his
head
with
his
toes
without
altering
his
position
what

you
do
for

that

a

chuckle
behind
you
as
the
last
words
are
spoken
brings
you
sharp
round
on
your
heels
and
you
discern
huddled
in
the
of
the
corner
what
appears
in
the
miserable
light
of

a
goanese
boy
there
are
the
short
gray
knickers
and
the
thin
white
shirt
affected
by
the
native
christian
boy
there
is
the
short
black
hair
but
the
skin
is
white
unusually
white
for
a
native
of
goa
and
there
is
something
curious
about
the
face
which
prompts
you
to
ask
the
owner
who
he
is
and
whence
he
comes
the
only
reply
is
a
vacant
but
not
unpleasant
smile
and
the
armless
wastrel
then
volunteers
the
information
that
the
child
for
she
is
little
more
is
not
a
boy
but
a
girl
merciful
heaven
how
comes
she
here
amid
this
refuse
of
humanity
she
is
an
orphan
says
the
armless
one
and
she
is
her
parents
died
when
she
was
very
young
and
her
mind
became
somehow
weak
there
was
none
to
take
charge
of
her
so
we
of
the
brought
her
here
and
in
return
for
our
support
she
runs
errands
for
us
and
prepares
the
room
for
the
nightly
conclave
she
is
a
mahomedan
you
look
again
at
the
child
smiling
in
the
corner
and
you
wonder
what
horror
what
or
what
grief
brought
her
to
this
pass
peradventure
it
is
a
mercy
that
her
mind
has
gone
and
can
not
therefore
revolt
against
the
squalor
of
her
surroundings
it
is
useless
to
ask
her
of
herself
she
can
only
smile
in
her
scanty
boyish
garb
it
is
the
saddest
sight
in
this
valley
of
the
abyss
where
men
purchase
draughts
of
nepenthe
to
fortify
themselves
against
the
cares
that

kills

a
iv
the
birthplace
of
shivaji
about
half
a
mile
westward
of
the
town
of
junnar
there
rises
from
the
plain
a
colossal
hill
the
lower
portion
whereof
consists
of
steep
slopes
covered
with
rough
grass
and
a
few
trees
and
the
upper
part
of
two
nearly
perpendicular
tiers
of
scarped
rock
surmounted
by
an
undulating
and
summit
the
upper
tier
commences
at
a
height
of
six
hundred
feet
from
the
level
of
the
plain
and
rising
another
feet
extends
dark
and
repellant
round
the
entire
circumference
of
the
hill
viewed
from
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
upper
scarp
which
runs
straight
to
a
point
in
the
north
bears
the
strongest
similarity
to
the
side
of
a
huge
battleship
riding
over
billows
long
since
petrified
and
grass
grown
and
the
similarity
is
accentuated
by
the
presence
in
both
scarps
of
a
line
of
small
buddhist
cells
the
apertures
of
which
are
visible
at
a
considerable
distance
and
appear
like
the
portholes
or
of
the
fossilised
vessel
unless
one
has
a
predilection
for
pushing
one
way
through
a
perpendicular
jungle
or
crawling
over
jagged
and
sunbaked
rock
the
only
way
to
ascend
the
hill
is
from
the
side
from
the
upper
portion
of
which
still
frown
the
outworks
and
bastioned
walls
which
once
rendered
the
fortress
impregnable
the
road
from
the
town
of
junnar
is
in
tolerable
repair
and
leads
you
across
a
stream
past
the
ruined
mud
walls
of
an
old
fortified
enclosure
and
past
the
of
the
twelve
wells
until
you
reach
a
group
of
trees
overshadowing
the
ruined
tombs
of
a
former
captain
of
the
fort
and
other
musulmans
the
grave
of
the
killedar
is
still
in
fair
condition
but
the
walls
which
enclose
it
are
sorely
dilapidated
and
the
wild
thorn
and
prickly
pear
creeping
unchecked
through
the
interstices
have
run
riot
over
the
whole
enclosure
at
this
point
one
must
leave
the
main
road
which
runs
forward
to
the
crest
of
the
pirpadi
pass
and
after
crossing
a
level
stretch
of
rock
set
steps
upon
the
pathway
which
flanked
on
one
side
by
the
lofty
of
the
hill
and
on
the
other
by
the
rolling
slopes
leads
upwards
to
the
first
gate
at
your
feet
lies
the
deserted
and
ruined
village
of
bhatkala
which
once
supplied
the
musulman
garrison
with
food
and
other
necessaries
and
is
now
but
a
memory
and
above
your
head
the
wall
and
outwork
of
the
phatak
tower
mark
the
vicinity
of
the
shrine
of
shivabai
the
family
goddess
of
the
founder
of
the
maratha
empire
the
pathway
yields
place
to
a
steep
and
ascent
girt
with
dense
clumps
of
prickly
pear
extending
as
far
as
the
first
gateway
of
the
fortress
there
are
in
all
seven
great
gateways
guarding
the
approach
to
the
of
which
the
first
already
mentioned
the
second
or
parvangicha
darvaja
the
fourth
or
saint
gate
and
the
fifth
or
shivabai
gate
are
perhaps
more
interesting
than
the
rest
one
wonders
why
there
should
be
seven
gateways
no
more
and
no
less
was
it
merely
an
accident
or
the
physical
formation
of
the
which
led
to
the
choice
of
this
number
or
was
it
perhaps
a
memory
of
the
mysterious
power
of
the
number
seven
exemplified
in
both
hebrew
and
hindu
writings
which
induced
the
musulman
to
build
that
number
of
entrances
to
his
the
coincidence
merits
passing
thought
the
second
gateway
originally
bore
on
either
side
at
the
level
of
the
point
of
its
arch
a
mystic
tiger
carved
on
the
face
of
a
stone
slab
holding
in
its
right
forepaw
some
animal
which
the
declares
is
an
elephant
but
which
more
closely
resembles
a
dog
the
tiger
on
the
left
of
the
arch
alone
abides
in
its
place
the
other
lies
on
the
ground
at
the
threshold
of
the
gate
local
wiseacres
believe
the
tiger
to
have
been
the
crest
of
the
killedar
who
built
the
gate
and
to
have
signified
to
the
public
of
those
lawless
days
much
the
same
as
the
famous
escutcheon
in
marmion
with
its
legend
who
laughs
at
me
to
death
is
dight
the
saint
gate
so
called
from
the
tomb
of
a
pir
hidden
in
the
surrounding
growth
of
prickly
pear
is
the
largest
of
all
the
gates
and
is
formed
of
splendid
slabs
of
dressed
stone
each
about
feet
in
length
on
either
side
of
the
gateway
are
rectangular
recesses
which
were
doubtless
used
as
dwellings
or
guardrooms
by
the
soldiers
in
charge
of
the
gate
thence
the
pathway
divides
one
track
intended
for
cavalry
leading
round
to
the
side
of
the
hill
and
the
other
for
composed
of
steps
and
passing
directly
upwards
to
the
shivabai
gate
where
still
hangs
the
great
studded
with
iron
spikes
against
which
the
mad
elephants
of
an
opposing
force
might
fruitlessly
hurl
their
titanic
bulk
leaving
for
a
moment
the
direct
path
which
climbs
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
past
the
buddhist
caves
and
cisterns
we
walk
along
a
dainty
terrace
lined
with
champak
and
sandalwood
trees
and
passing
under
a
carved
stone
gateway
halt
before
the
shrine
dedicated
to
shivaji
family
goddess
the
dark
inner
shrine
must
have
once
been
a
buddhist
cave
carved
out
of
the
wall
of
rock
and
to
it
later
generations
added
the
outer
hall
with
its
carved
pillars
of
teakwood
which
hangs
over
the
very
edge
of
a
precipitous
descent
repairs
to
the
shrine
are
at
present
in
progress
and
on
the
day
of
our
visit
two
bullocks
were
tethered
in
the
outer
chamber
the
materials
of
the
were
lying
here
and
there
among
the
carved
pillars
and
a
painfully
modern
stone
wall
is
rising
in
face
of
the
austere
threshold
of
the
inner
sanctuary
the
lintel
of
the
shrine
is
surmounted
with
inferior
coloured
pictures
of
hindu
deities
and
two
printed
and
tolerably
faithful
portraits
of
the
great
maratha
chieftain
thence
in
the
words
of
the
poet
we
turned
and
slowly
clomb
the
last
hard
footstep
of
that
iron
crag
and
traversing
the
seventh
and
last
gate
reached
the
ruined
or
on
the
hill
top
it
is
a
picture
of
great
desolation
which
meets
the
eye
the
fragment
of
a
wall
or
plinth
covered
with
rank
creepers
an
archway
of
which
the
stones
are
sagging
into
final
disruption
and
many
a
tumulus
of
coarse
brown
grass
are
all
that
remain
of
the
wide
buildings
which
once
surrounded
the
the
latter
gray
and
still
rears
on
high
its
double
row
of
arched
vaults
but
vandalism
in
the
guise
of
the
local
shepherd
and
has
claimed
it
as
her
own
and
has
bricked
up
in
the
rudest
fashion
for
the
shelter
of
goats
and
kine
the
pointed
stone
arches
which
were
once
its
pride
another
noteworthy
feature
of
the
summit
of
the
hill
is
a
collection
of
stone
cisterns
of
varying
ages
still
containing
water
the
smaller
open
cisterns
in
which
the
water
is
thick
and
covered
with
slime
are
of
musalman
origin
but
there
are
one
or
two
in
other
parts
of
the
hill
which
clearly
date
from
buddhist
ages
and
are
coeval
with
the
the
most
important
and
interesting
of
all
are
four
large
reservoirs
supported
on
massive
pillars
and
hewn
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
which
date
from
about
and
were
in
all
probability
built
by
the
yadav
dynasty
of
deogiri
one
of
them
known
as
ganga
and
jamna
is
full
of
clear
cool
water
which
the
people
say
is
excellent
for
drinking
here
again
the
hand
of
the
vandal
has
not
been
idle
for
such
names
as
gopal
ramchandra
are
scrawled
in
english
characters
over
the
face
of
the
chief
reservoir
the
holiday
work
no
doubt
of
from
junnar
the
presence
of
these
four
reservoirs
coupled
with
other
disappearing
clues
proves
that
between
the
buddhist
era
and
the
date
of
the
musulman
conquest
the
hill
must
have
been
fortified
and
held
by
hindu
chieftains
probably
the
yadavas
already
mentioned
the
purely
musulman
remains
include
the
a
or
the
skeleton
of
a
mosque
with
a
delicate
flying
arch
and
a
domed
tomb
in
front
of
the
prayer
wall
still
stands
the
stone
pulpit
from
which
the
of
the
fortress
preached
and
intoned
the
daily
prayers
but
neither
the
nor
the
mosque
have
withstood
the
attacks
of
time
as
bravely
as
the
tomb
for
here
scarce
a
stone
has
become
displaced
and
the
four
pointed
arches
which
rise
upwards
to
the
circular
dome
are
as
unblemished
as
on
the
day
when
the
builder
gazed
upon
his
finished
work
and
found
it
good
the
speaks
of
it
as
a
man
tomb
but
the
flat
within
the
arches
points
to
it
being
a
woman
grave
and
local
tradition
declares
that
it
is
the
body
of
the
mother
of
one
daulat
khan
which
lies
here
had
those
she
left
behind
sought
to
bring
peace
to
her
dust
they
could
have
chosen
no
more
fitting
site
for
her
entombment
for
each
face
of
the
grave
commands
a
wide
prospect
of
mountain
and
valley
the
massive
hills
rising
tier
after
tier
in
the
distance
until
they
are
but
faint
shadows
on
the
horizon
the
intense
solitude
peculiar
to
is
broken
but
fitfully
by
the
lamentation
and
even
when
the
sun
in
beats
down
fiercely
upon
the
grassy
barrows
of
the
hill
top
the
breeze
blows
chill
through
the
open
arches
and
the
dome
casts
a
deep
shadow
over
all
at
a
little
distance
from
the
mosque
are
two
rooms
built
of
stone
in
one
of
which
according
to
our
muhammadan
guide
shivaji
was
born
whether
it
was
actually
upon
the
rough
walls
of
this
small
chamber
that
shivaji
eyes
first
rested
is
open
to
considerable
doubt
and
probably
they
are
but
a
small
portion
of
a
once
spacious
mansion
which
covered
the
surrounding
area
now
and
desolate
and
in
which
the
family
of
the
chieftain
resided
these
crumbling
halls
the
shrine
of
shivabai
and
the
outwork
at
the
extreme
north
point
of
the
hill
are
the
only
remains
directly
connected
with
maratha
supremacy
the
which
overhangs
the
sheer
northern
scarp
performed
the
same
function
as
the
famous
tarpeian
rock
of
old
rome
thence
the
malefactor
of
maratha
days
was
hurled
down
to
swift
death
and
history
records
one
instance
of
seven
outlaws
being
cast
unrespited
unpitied
unreprieved
into
space
from
this
inaccessible
eyrie
by
an
officer
of
the
peshwa
viewed
from
this
point
the
whole
plain
seems
a
vast
brown
sea
streaked
here
and
there
with
green
and
the
smaller
hills
rise
like
islands
from
it
their
feet
folded
in
the
mist
which
creeps
across
the
levels
to
the
north
beyond
the
larger
ranges
which
encircle
the
valley
the
peak
of
harischandragad
is
dimly
visible
towering
above
the
sahyadris
and
across
the
plain
to
eastward
the
suleman
range
ends
in
the
huge
rounded
shoulders
of
the
ganesh
lena
spur
shivner
has
known
many
changes
it
gave
shelter
to
the
buddhist
in
the
first
and
second
centuries
of
the
christian
era
it
was
excavated
and
fortified
by
early
hindu
kings
who
in
turn
yielded
place
to
the
imperial
banditti
and
they
held
it
until
the
english
came
and
cried
a
truce
to
the
old
fierce
wars
and
all
these
have
left
traces
of
their
sovereignty
amid
the
rocks
the
grass
and
the
rank
weeds
of
the
hill
it
is
a
living
illustration
of
the
words
of
the
poet
think
in
this
batter
caravanserai
whose
portals
are
alternate
night
and
day
how
sultan
after
sultan
with
his
pomp
abode
his
destined
hour
and
went
his
way
the
story
of
imtiazan
the
scene
of
her
earliest
memories
was
a
small
room
with
spotless
the
windows
whereof
looked
out
upon
the
foliage
of
ber
and
tamarind
during
the
day
a
man
would
recline
upon
the
cushions
idly
fondling
her
and
calling
her
piyari
dearest
and
at
night
a
pretty
young
woman
would
place
her
in
a
jhula
and
sing
her
to
sleep
then
the
scene
changes
he
of
the
black
beard
is
away
and
the
form
of
the
beloved
lies
stark
beneath
a
white
sheet
while
mysterious
women
folk
go
to
and
fro
within
the
house
a
old
man
who
in
earlier
days
had
helped
her
build
little
beneath
the
trees
takes
her
from
the
warm
cot
and
hands
her
over
to
a
woman
of
stern
face
and
rasping
tongue
with
whom
she
dwells
disconsolate
until
one
fateful
day
she
finds
herself
alone
in
a
weeping
the
passionate
tears
of
the
waif
and
orphan
but
deliverance
is
at
hand
the
sight
of
the
weeping
child
touches
a
chord
in
the
heart
of
gowhar
jan
the
famous
dancing
girl
of
lahore
she
takes
the
orphan
home
christens
her
imtiazan
and
does
her
best
to
blunt
the
evil
memories
of
her
desertion
gowhar
jan
did
her
duty
by
the
child
according
to
her
lights
she
engaged
the
best
gawayyas
to
teach
her
music
the
best
to
teach
her
dancing
the
best
ustads
to
teach
her
elocution
and
deportment
and
the
best
of
munshis
to
ground
her
in
urdu
and
persian
so
that
when
imtiazan
reached
her
fifteenth
year
her
accomplishments
were
noised
abroad
in
the
bazaar
beautiful
too
she
was
with
the
fair
complexion
of
the
slightly
aquiline
nose
large
dark
eyes
and
raven
hair
the
latter
unadorned
and
drawn
simply
back
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
her
mother
people
which
forbids
the
unmarried
girl
to
part
her
hair
or
deck
it
with
flowers
her
dress
the
loose
trousers
the
white
bodice
and
the

of

pink
but
added
to
her
charm
yet
was
gowhar
jan
troubled
at
heart
for
the
girl
was
in
her
eyes
too
modest
too
retiring
and
cared
not
at
all
whether
her
songs
and
dances
found
favour
with
the
rich
landholders
sikh
sardars
and
the
sons
of

millionaires
who
crowded
to

alas
sighed
gowhar

she
will
never
be
like
chanda
malika
gay
witty
and
famous
for
generations
her
education
has
been
wasted
and

will

that
he
was
able
straightway
and
without
mistake
to
accompany
imtiazan
most
difficult
songs
thereafter
he
came
often
to
the
house
and
gradually
played
himself
into
the
affection
of
the
young
girl
who
after
some
hesitation
consented
to
marry
him
and
elope
with
him
to
a
distant
city
thus
imtiazan
left
the
house
of
her
girlhood
and
fled
with
her
husband
to
bombay
money
they
had
not
imtiazan
not
without
a
pang
sold
her
necklace
of
gold
beads
and
bravely
started
in
the
one
small
room
they
chose
as
their
home
while
he
went
forth
to
seek
employment
worthy
of
his
degree
at
the
calcutta
university
and
of
his
rohilla
ancestry
but
alas
work
came
not
to
his
hands
and
as
the
money
slowly
dwindled
he
grew
morose
and
irritable
and
often
made
her
weep
silently
as
she
sat
stitching
the
embroidery
designed
to
provide
the
daily
meal
she
knew
full
well
that
vain
pride
baulked
his
employment
and
after
many
a
struggle
she
prevailed
upon
him
to
become
a
an
undergraduate
who
has
read
herbert
spencer
comte
and
voltaire
said
he
can
not
demean
himself
to
for
the
public
to
which
she
justly
replied
that
an
education
which
prevents
a
man
earning
his
daily
bread
must
be
worthless
so
in
due
course
he
installed
himself
with
an
ill
grace
upon
the
footpath
of
bhendi
bazaar
with
portfolio
and
inkhorn
writing
letters
for
uneducated
musulmans
petitions
for
candidates
and
english
accounts
for
butlers
and
the
more
he
wrote
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
he
was
sacrificing
himself
for
a
woman
who
could
not
realize
the
measure
of
his
fall
thus
for
a
time
matters
remained
little
imtiazan
wearing
her
delicate
fingers
out
at
home
he
plying
his
pen
in
the
street
until
one
day
a
from
lucknow
called
him
to
her
house
to
write
an
important
missive
on
her
behalf
this
chance
acquaintance
ripened
into
a
friendship
that
boded
no
good
for
imtiazan
for
within
a
month
amid
specious
statements
of
lucrative
employment
and
fair
promises
of
future
he
bade
her
prepare
to
leave
the
small
room
and
accompany
him
to
a
larger
house
fronting
a
main
thoroughfare
which
said
he
would
henceforth
be
their
home
the
sight
of
the
unscreened
windows
of
her
new
home
struck
a
chill
into
imtiazan
heart
and
when
the
door
opened
and
she
was
met
by
three
elderly
muhammadans
who
saluted
her
as
their
fear
took
possession
of
her
soul
the
thin
red
cases
hanging
on
the
wall
told
her
that
the
men
were
musicians
and
in
response
to
the
mute
appeal
in
her
eyes
her
husband
bade
her
with
almost
brutal
candour
prepare
to
adopt
her
old
profession
of
dancing
and
singing
in
order
to
save
him
from
the
hateful
duties
of
a
public
for
two
days
imtiazan
tended
by
the
musicians
and
their
wives
was
a
prey
to
the
blackest
despair
and
then
deeming
it
useless
to
protest
she
set
herself
courageously
to
do
her
husband
bidding
and
to
dance
as
she
had
danced
in
the
house
of
gowhar
jan
but
she
little
knew
the
true
depths
of
her
husband
selfishness
money
comes
not
fast
enough
was
his
perpetual
cry
and
he
urged
her
at
first
gently
but
with
vehemence
to
sink
still
lower
the
memory
of
the
past
and
who
knows
what
higher
instinct
helped
her
to
withstand
his
sordid
demands
for
many
days
but
at
length
realizing
that
this
was
and
tired
of
the
perpetual
upbraiding
she
consented
to
do
his
bidding
so
for
three
weary
years
the
waters
closed
over
imtiazan
one
day
she
awoke
to
find
that
her
husband
had
crowned
his
villainy
by
decamping
with
her
valuables
and
all
her
savings
she
followed
and
found
him
and
pressing
into
his
hand
a
little
extra
money
that
he
had
in
his
hurry
overlooked
she
bade
him
a
bitter
farewell
for
ever
she
rested
a
day
or
two
to
get
herself
properly
divorced
from
him
and
then
returned
alone
to
the
hated
life
in
bombay
there
fortune
smiled
upon
her
and
wealth
poured
into
her
lap
two
years
later
by
dint
of
careful
inquiry
she
discovered
that
the
woman
who
had
abandoned
her
in
the
lahore
market
was
her
uncle
wife
now
widowed
and
in
poverty
and
to
her
she
of
her
bounty
gave
a
pension
for
imtiazan
though
she
never
forgot
could
always
forgive
and
had
never
lost
the
sense
of
her
duty
to
relations
she
also
provided
for
the
old
man
who
had
helped
her
when
a
child
to
build
the
beneath
the
trees
of
her
old
home
and
then
while
still
young
and
with
enough
money
left
to
keep
herself
in
comparative
affluence
she
turned
her
back
for
ever
upon
the
profession
which
she
loathed
and
devoted
the
rest
of
her
life
to
the
careful
rearing
of
an
orphan
girl
whom
the
desire
for
a
child
of
her
own
and
the
memories
of
her
own
youth
urged
her
to
adopt
when
she
died
the
child
who
had
grown
up
and
under
her
guidance
had
married
a
respectable
merchant
mourned
for
her
as
one
mourns
for
those
who
have
lovingly
shielded
our
infancy
and
youth
and
many
of
the
neighbours
were
sincerely
grieved
that
imtiazan
had
departed
for
ever
such
is
the
of
imtiazan
one
of
the
most
famous
bombay
has
ever
known
a
history
that
lacks
not
pathos
after
her
final
renunciation
of
the
profession
of
singing
and
dancing
she
might
have
remarried
and
in
fact
received
more
than
one
offer
from
men
who
were
attracted
by
her
kindliness
of
heart
and
by
her
beauty
but
she
declined
them
all
with
the
words
marriage
is
not
my
which
is
but
the
indian
equivalent
of
my
faith
hath
departed
and
my
heart
is
broken
surely
the
earth
lies
very
lightly
upon
imtiazan
vi
the
bombay
mohurrum
stray
scenes
the
luxury
of
grief
seems
common
to
mankind
all
the
world
over
and
the
mourning
of
the
mohurrum
finds
its
counterpart
in
the
old
lamentation
for
the
slain
adonis
the
emotional
tale
of
sohrab
death
at
the
hand
of
his
sire
rustom
and
the
sorrow
of
the
christian
passion
the
persian
inclination
towards
the
emotional
side
of
human
nature
was
not
slow
to
discover
amid
the
early
martyrs
of
the
faith
one
figure
whose
pathetic
end
was
powerful
to
awaken
every
chord
of
human
pity
the
picture
of
the
women
and
children
of
high
lineage
deceived
deserted
and
tortured
with
thirst
of
the
child
arms
lopped
at
the
wrist
even
at
the
moment
they
were
stretched
forth
for
the
blessing
of
the
imam
of
the
noblest
chief
of
islam
betrayed
and
choosing
death
to
dishonour
of
his
last
lonely
onset
his
death
and
mutilation
at
the
hand
of
a
former
friend
and
of
the
faith
this
picture
indeed
appealed
and
still
appeals
as
no
other
can
to
the
hidden
depths
of
the
persian
heart
the
sunni
may
object
to
the
choice
of
hasan
and
husain
as
the
martyrs
most
worthy
of
lamentation
putting
forward
in
their
stead
omar
companion
of
the
prophet
himself
who
lingered
for
three
days
in
the
agony
of
death
or
othman
the
third
khalifa
who
died
of
thirst
or
the
lion
of
god
whose
life
came
to
so
disastrous
a
close
but
the
shia
while
admitting
that
the
death
of
the
first
martyrs
may
have
wrought
severer
loss
to
islam
can
not
admit
that
their
end
surpasses
in
pathos
the
tale
of
the
bitter
tenth
of
mohurrum
when
the
stars
quivered
in
a
bloodied
sky
and
the
very
walls
of
the
palace
of
kufa
rained
tears
of
blood
as
the
head
of
the
martyr
was
borne
before
them
he
can
not
also
approve
the
sunni
practice
of
converting
a
season
of
mourning
into
one
of
revelry
and
brawl
for
he
does
not
realize
the
influence
of
the
local
hindu
element
upon
the
mohurrum
and
can
not
comprehend
that
the
indian
additions
to
the
festival
have
their
roots
in
the
deep
soil
of
hindu
for
to
the
hindu
and
to
the
sunni
mahomedan
who
has
borrowed
somewhat
from
him
all
seasons
of
death
and
mourning
act
as
a
to
the
unhoused
and
naked
spirits
who
are
ever
wandering
through
the
silent
spaces
of
the
east
some
of
these
spirits
we
can
appease
or
coax
into
becoming
by
housing
them
in
handsome
cenotaphs
others
we
can
lodge
in
the
or
in
that
great
the
tiger
letting
them
sport
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
bodies
of
our
men
and
youths
who
are
adorned
with
yellow
stripes
symbolical
of
their
rôle
while
other
more
malevolent
spirits
can
only
be
driven
away
by
shouting
buffeting
and
drumming
such
as
characterize
the
mohurrum
season
in
bombay
the
indian
element
of
nervous
excitement
might
in
course
of
ages
have
been
sobered
by
the
puritanism
of
islam
but
for
the
presence
of
the
african
who
unites
with
a
firm
belief
in
spirits
a
phenomenal
desire
for
noise
and
brawling
and
it
is
the
union
of
this
jovial
african
element
with
the
sentimentality
of
persia
and
the
of
pure
hinduism
which
renders
the
bombay
mohurrum
more
lively
and
more
varied
than
any
mahomedan
celebration
in
cairo
damascus
or
constantinople
although
the
regular
mohurrum
ceremonies
do
not
commence
until
the
fifth
day
of
the
mohurrum
moon
the
mahomedan
quarters
of
the
city
are
astir
on
the
first
of
the
month
from
morn
till
eve
the
streets
are
filled
with
bands
of
boys
and
sometimes
girls
blowing
raucous
blasts
on
hollow
bamboos

are
adorned
with

afflicted

into

near

description
of
the
martyrdom
of
husain
while

a
little
distance
away
boys
painted
to

leap
to
the

the
arab
mummer
with
the
split
bamboo
shatters
the
nerves
of
the
passerby
by
suddenly
cracking
it
behind
his
back
the
fact
that
this
arab
usually
takes
up
a
strong
position
near
a
suggests
the
idea
that
he
must
originally
have
represented
a
guardian
or
scapegoat
designed
to
break
by
means
of
his
abuse
buffoonery
and
laughter
the
spell
of
the
spirits
who
long
for
quarters
within

rich
mimic
tomb

the
fact
that
the
crowds
who
come
to
gaze
in
admiration
on
the
never
retort
or
round
upon
him
for
the
sudden
fright
or
anger
that
he
evokes
gives
one
the
impression
that
the
crack
of
the
bamboo
is
in
their
belief
a
potent
scarer
of
unhoused
and
malignant
spirits
turn
off
the
main
thoroughfare
and
you
may
perhaps
find
a
lean
musalman
with
a
green
silk
skullcap
sitting
in
a
raised
and
recess
in
front
of
an
urn
in
which
frankincense
is
burning
he
has
taken
a
vow
to
be
a
dula
or
bridegroom
during
the
mohurrum
there
he
sits
craning
his
neck
over
the
smoke
from
the
urn
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
while
at
intervals
three
companions
who
squat
beside
him
give
vent
to
a
cry
of

on

a

surmounted
with

place
in

almost
on

a

comes

on

with

sets
forth
again
upon

further
down
the

bazaar
a

comes
forward
for
enlightenment
and
the

after
repeating

promises
that

will
become
a

close

by

flicked
thrice
with

bidden
to

gradually
forward

by
a
kunbi
with

by

musulman
until
he
reaches
the

he
falls
forward
on

with
frothing
mouth
and
convulsed

the

racks
him
to

into

of
about
four
hours

around

the
most
curious
feature
of
the

celebration
is
the
roystering

brawling
of
the
or
which
takes
places
for
two
or
three
nights
after
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
each
street
has
its
own
band

to

the

quarters
of
the
city

fight
with
the
bands
of
rival
streets

the
rivalry

as

the

see
the
connection
between
these
brawling
and
the
lamentation
for
hasan

husein

the
rivalry
of
the
recalls
the
which
used
once
to
take
place
between
the
various
quarters
of
gujarat
and
kathiawar
towns
during
the
holi
festival

the
beating

general
pandemonium

by

probably
akin

extravagance
once

the
beating

a
relic

associated
with
the
great
mahomedan
festival
of
tears
originally
they
can
have
had
no
connection
with
the
mohurrum
and
are
in
essence
as
much
divorced
from
the
lamentation
over
the
slaughter
at
karbala

vii
the
possession
of
afiza
it
was
quite
evident
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
with
abdulla
the
dhobi
his
features
had
lost
their
former
placidity
and
wore
an
aspect
of
troubled
wonder
the
clothes
which
he
erstwhiles
washed
and
returned
to
their
owners
with
such
regularity
were
now
brought
back
long
after
the
proper
date
and
occasionally
were
not
returned
at
all
and
the
easy
good
temper
which
once
characterized
his
conversation
had
yielded
place
to
sudden
outbursts
of
anger
or
protracted
spells
of
sulkiness
the
consulted
on
the
point
could
only
suggest
that
abdulla
was
typical
of
the
inherent
badmashi
of
the
dhobi
nature
and
that
probably
abdulla
had
taken
to
nocturnal
potations
while
the
youngest
member
of
the
household
unhesitatingly
laid
down
that
abdulla
had
been
seized
by
a
bhut
or
in
other
words
was
possessed
of
a
devil
when
the
former
suggestion
was
laid
before
abdulla
he
contemned
it
with
unmeasured
scorn
and
then
turned
and
rent
the
spirit
of
the
butler
with
winged
words
but
the
small
opinion
seemed
to
give
him
pause
he
held
his
peace
for
a
moment
gazing
earthwards
and
rubbing
a
small
heap
of
dust
towards
him
with
his
toe
and
then
on
a
sudden
he
burst
out
into
the
tale
which
is
here
set
down
in
his
own
words
nay
saheb
i
am
possessed
of
no
devil
but
my
wife
afiza
is
sore
troubled
by
one
only
three
months
ago
i
sent
for
her
from
my
village
as
she
was
expecting
to
become
a
mother
and
i
was
desirous
of
looking
early
upon
my
child
and
for
six
weeks
she
dwelt
contentedly
with
me
in
the
house
which
i
have
rented
near
the
ghat
and
then
the
child
was
born
a
child
without
blemish
and
afiza
and
i
were
happy
but
saheb
the
shadow
of
evil
was
even
then
drawing
nigh
unto
us
for
on
the
sixth
day
after
birth
when
the
midwife
was
about
to
light
the
lamp
for
the
ceremony
afiza
suddenly
cast
the
child
from
her
leaped
wildly
from
the
couch
tearing
at
her
hair
and
swaying
to
and
fro
as
one
demented
and
broke
the
lamp
with
her
hands
and
the
midwife
fled
from
the
room
crying
for
help
and
brought
my
mother
and
my
sister
in
to
try
and
soothe
her
and
even
while
they
wrestled
with
her
spirit
someone
set
light
to
the
urn
of
frankincense
for
it
was
the
evening
of
thursday
and
as
the
thick
smoke
curled
upwards
towards
afiza
she
trembled
and
gasped
out
is
my
house
and
this
woman
hath
been
delivered
on
the
spot
where
i
died
in
childbirth
five
years
ago
i
will
never
cease
troubling
her
for
she
hath
forgotten
even
to
burn
a
little
frankincense
for
the
repose
of
my
spirit
so
saying
my
wife
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
and
remained
motionless
for
thirty
minutes
until
the
spirit
had
fled
and
saheb
from
that
day
forward
not
an
evening
passes
but
the
the
spirit
of
a
woman
who
has
died
in
travail
lays
hold
upon
her
and
my
house
has
become
a
place
of
evil
and
a
byword
among
the
neighbours
several
exorcists
siyanas
and
syeds
have
we
consulted
but
all
in
vain
their
ministrations
only
make
her
worse
what
can
be
done
one
can
hardly
conjecture
the
ultimate
fate
of
abdulla
and
his
family
had
not
some
one
who
took
an
interest
in
the
case
suggested
a
final
resort
to
the
syed
from
cambay
who
some
little
time
ago
opened
in
goghari
street
a
branch
of
the
famous
gujarat
shrine
of
miran
datar
to
him
abdulla
repaired
and
the
syed
came
into
his
house
and
gave
afiza
a
potion
composed
of
and
water
from
the
miran
shrine
but
the
evil
spirit
was
terribly
violent
and
it
required
regular
treatment
of
this
nature
for
fully
twenty
days
ere
it
could
be
dislodged
evening
after
evening
afiza
was
taken
into
the
presence
of
syed
who
summoned
forth
the
spirit
with
a
drink
of
the
sacrosanct
water
and
at
home
abdulla
and
his
mother
who
had
been
supplied
with
water
and
ashes
by
the
syed
were
wont
likewise
to
summon
the
spirit
at
any
hour
which
they
felt
would
cause
it
inconvenience
thus
the
struggle
between
the
powers
of
light
and
darkness
for
the
soul
of
afiza
continued
until
at
length
the
evil
spirit
deemed
it
wise
to
depart
and
on
the
day
when
it
was
racking
afiza
for
the
last
time
it
demanded
as
the
final
price
of
its
departure
the
liver
of
a
so
abdulla
hearkened
to
the
will
and
buried
the
pledge
of
his
wife
recovery
in
a
new
earthen
pot
just
at
the
spot
where
the
four
roads
meet
near
his
house
and
afiza
was
at
peace
illustration
possession
of
afiza
since
that
date
nought
has
occurred
to
disturb
abdulla
peace
of
mind
the
syed
of
goghari
street
has
earned
fame
among
the
poorer
musulman
inhabitants
of
that
quarter
abdulla
has
cast
off
his
ill
temper
as
it
were
a
garment
afiza
the
possessed

become
afiza
the
helping
abdulla
to
earn
his
livelihood
and
obtain
the
approval
of
his
masters

the

unharmed
by
the
evil
eye
and
beloved
of
his
parents
is
daily
waxing
in
favour
with
god
and
man
according
to

the

occasionally

wander
down
one
of
the
greatest
arteries
of
the
city
and
you
will
perhaps
notice
on
the
east
side
of
the
street
a
house
bearing
all
the
appearance
of
prolonged
neglect
and
decay
enter
the
low
door
and
take
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
and
you
will
find
yourself
at
length
on
an
smelling
landing
with
a
creaking
staircase
in
one
corner
enveloped
from
top
to
bottom
in
darkness
so
profound
that
one
can
almost
conjure
up
visions
of
sudden
death
from
the
assassin
dagger
after
a
moment
hesitation
you
commence
to
grope
your
way
upwards
the
staircase
sways
and
creaks
beneath
your
feet
the
air
is
heavy
with
strange
odours
something
probably
a
cat
scuttles
past
you
and
nearly
upsets
your
balance
and
putting
out
your
hand
to
steady
yourself
your
fingers
touch
something
clammy
and
corpselike
which
turns
out
to
be
a
ghati
labourer
naked
save
for
a
asleep
in
the
narrow
niche
between
the
walls
of
the
and
the
first
storey
one
wonders
what
he
pays
for
this
precarious
accommodation
in
which
a
sudden
movement
during
sleep
may
mean
a
sheer
drop
down
the
dark
staircase
but
fortunately
he
sleeps
motionless
like
one
physically
tired
out
perchance
after
dragging
bales
about
the
dock
sheds
since
early
morn
or
wandering
all
day
round
the
city
with
heavy
loads
upon
his
head
at
length
on
the
second
storey
a
door
casts
an
arrow
of
light
upon
your
path
you
hail
it
with
joy
after
the
cimmerian
gloom
of
the
lower
floors
and
pushing
the
door
further
ajar
you
find
yourself
in
a
square
low
room
lit
by
two
windows
which
command
a
view
of
the
street

carpeted
with
cheap
mats
and

propped
against

in
a
attitude
around

from

one

two

one
woman
in
the
room
a
member
of
the
frail
sisterhood
now
turned
faithful
nursing
an
elderly
and
peevish
lothario
with
a
cup
of
gruel
which
consider
such
a
delicacy
while
the
other
customers
sit
in
groups
talking
with
the
preternatural
solemnity
born
of
their
favourite
drug
and
now
and
again
passing
a
remark
to
the
landlord
with
the
white
and
beard
each
occupant
of
the
room
has
been
provided
with
a
tiny
glass

for
the
beverage
some

one
glass
some
two
some
three
or
more
but
as
a
rule
the
kasumba
drinker
confines
himself
to
two
glasses
being
ashamed
to
own
even
to
a
brother
tiryaki
the
real
quantity
of
the
drug
consumed
by
him
while
a
few
strengthened
by
prolonged
habit
pay
somewhat
more
than
the
ordinary
price
for
a
thicker
and
stronger
dilution
when
the
glasses
are
empty
the
company
calls
for
desert
for
the

the

straightway
produces
sweets

parched
grain
or
known
as

to
the
taste
of
his
customers
hardly
has
dessert
ended
when
an
elderly
mahomedan
in
shabby
garb
falls
out
of
the
group
and
clearing
his
throat
to
attract
attention
commences
to
recite
a
flowery
prelude
in
verse
he
is
the

of

of

to

serves
as
an
agreeable
contrast
to
the
somewhat
ponderous

of

thus
the
whiles
away
time
until
about
when
the
club
breaks
up
and
the
faded
aspasia
helps
her
fractious
pericles
down
the
rotten
staircase
and
out
into
the
night
ere

subscribes

then
with

word
of
peace
to
the
landlord
the
men
troop
slowly
forth
to
their
homes
as
we
pass
down
the
rotten
staircase
lit
this
time
for
our
benefit
with
a
moribund
cocoanut
oil
lamp
we
mark
the
maratha
labourer
still
sleeping
heavily
in
his
niche
dreaming
perhaps
amid
the
heavy
odours
of
the
house
of
the
fresh
uplands
of
his
deccan
home
ix
the
ganesh
caves
miles
to
the
north
of
poona
lies
the
old
town
of
junner
which
owing
to
its
proximity
to
the
historic
nana
ghat
was
in
the
earliest
times
an
important
centre
of
trade
as
early
as
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
the
nana
pass
was
one
of
the
chief
highways
of
trade
between
aparantaka
or
the
northern
konkan
and
the
deccan
and
although
the
steep
and
slippery
nature
of
the
ascent
must
have
prevented
the
number
of
and
ponies
that
were
annually
driven
upwards
towards
the
cooler
atmosphere
and
richer
soil
of
junner
must
have
been
considerable
once
the
nana
ghat
had
been
crossed
the
traveller
found
himself
in
a
land
marked
out
by
nature
herself
for
sojourn
and
settlement
for
there
lay
before
his
eyes
a
fruitful
plain
and
girt
with
mighty
hills
of
rock
which
needed
but
the
skill
of
man
to
be
transformed
into
a
chain
of
those
viharas
or
places
of
rest
and
recreation
which
the
buddhists
of
and
early
christian
ages
sought
to
establish
thus
it
happens
that
in
each
of
the
mountain
ranges
which
rise
around
junner
are
found
caves
and
shrines
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
by
the
followers
of
buddhism
some
with
inscriptions
in
obsolete
characters
and
all
of
them
in
a
wonderful
state
of
preservation
considering
the
ages
that
have
passed
since
their
foundation
among
those
most
easy
of
access
are
the
ganesh
lena
as
they
are
called
hollowed
out
of
the
vast
rounded
scarp
which
rising
a
hundred
feet
above
the
plain
projects
from
the
hatkeshvar
and
suleman
ranges
about
a
mile
northward
of
the
town
a
fairly
smooth
but
dusty
road
leads
the
traveller
down
to
the
kukdi
river
dried
by
the
fair
weather
into
stagnant
pools
in
which
the
women
wash
their
clothes
and
the
buffaloes
lounge
heavily
and
thence
through
and
clumps
of
to
the
of
the
mountain
there
the
road
proper
merges
into
a
rocky
pathway
which
in
turn
yields
place
some
little
distance
further
on
to
a
series
of
masonry
steps
of
comparatively
recent
date
which
as
they
curve
upwards
recall
to
one
mind
the
hundred
steps
at
windsor
castle
the
steps
are
divided
into
about
ten
flights
and
are
said
to
have
been
built
at
different
times
by
devotees
of
god
ganesh
in
gratitude
for
his
having
granted
their
prayers
what
prompted
the
first
worshipper
to
prove
his
gratitude
in
this
form
none
can
say
he
might
have
so
easily
satisfied
his
conscience
with
a
presentation
to
the
god
or
by
the
erection
of
a
small
shrine
in
the
plains
but
happily
for
all
men
he
adopted
the
more
philanthropic
course
of
smoothing
the
road
to
the
presence
of
the
kindly
deity
others
the
recipients
of
like
favours
and
fired
by
his
example
added
each
in
their
turn
to
the
work
until
the
once
rude
track
was
transformed
into
a
massive
fit
for
the
feet
of
princes
the
caves
are
in
number
and
consist
mainly
of
dwellings
and
cells
with
three
two
of
which
bear
inscriptions
and
a
chapel
the
cells
are
all
hewn
into
somewhat
similar
pattern
and
shape
containing
on
one
and
sometimes
two
sides
long
stone
benches

doubtless
as
the
of
their
buddhist
occupants

of

struck
the

with
a
to
awaken
the
echoes

eddy
loudly
round
the
vault
and
rouse
the
wild
birds

the
birds

as
the
bats

lurk
in
the
darker
recesses
of
the

said
to
be
responsible
for
the
very
pungent
and
unpleasant
odour
which
greets
one
on
entering
and
forces
one
to
cut
short
one
visit
and
what
of
him
who
built
the
shrine
deep
in
the
back

of
the
verandah

graven
in
characters

inscription

some
time

scholars

tells
how
sulasadata
the
illustrious
son
of
heranika
of
kalyana
presented
the
chapel
to
the
monastery
to
the
glory
of
god
and
his

lasting
merit

words
are
headed
and
ended
with
the

converted
the
whole

into
a
temple
of
ganpati
whence
the

obtain
their
name
of
ganesh

the
once
plain
walls
whose
very
austerity
reflected
perhaps
the
life
of
the
monks
dwelling
within

been
rudely
plastered

covered
with

so
thickly
smeared

that
the

this
is
ganesh
the

ganesh

not

they

the
untutored
villager

has

you

straightway
comes

answer
sahib
these
were
not
built
by
man

by
the
gods

in

of
the
great
to
the
of
dadar
lies
an
oart
known
as
borkar
wadi
shaded
by
tall
trees

summits
ward
off
the
sun
and
form
a
glistening
screen
at
nights
what
time
the
moon
rises
above
the
eastern
hills
not
very
long
ago
at
a
time
when
cholera
had
appeared
in
the
city
and
was
taking
a
daily
toll
of
life
this
oart
was
the
scene
of
a
ceremony
organized
by
the
bhandaris
of
dadar
and
mahim
and
designed
to
propitiate
the
wrath
of
the
who
had
slain
several
members
of
that
ancient
and
worthy
community
for
the
bhandaris
be
it
noted
know
little
of
western
theories
of
disease
and
sanitation
and
such
precautions
as
the
boiling
of
water
even
were
there
time
to
boil
it
and
abstention
from
fruit
seem
to
them
utterly
beside
the
mark
and
valueless
so
long
as
the
goddess
of
cholera
jarimari
and
the
cholera
mothers
are
wroth
with
them
thus
at
the
time
we
speak
of
when
many
deaths
among
their
kith
and
kin
had
afforded
full
proof
that
the
goddess
was
enraged
they
met
in
solemn
conclave
and
decided
to
perform
every
sunday
and
tuesday
night
for
a
month
such
a
ceremony
as
would
delight
the
heart
of
that
powerful
deity
and
stave
off
further
mortality
the
limitation
of
the
period
of
propitiation
to
one
month
was
based
not
so
much
upon
religious
grounds
as
upon
the
fact
that
a
municipality
with
purely
western
ideas
of
sanitation
and
of
combating
epidemics
refused
to
allow
the
maintenance
of
the
shed
which
was
to
be
the
temporary
home
of
jarimari
for
more
than
thirty
days
yet
it
matters
but
little
this
for
a
month
is
quite
long
enough
for
the
complete
assuagement
of
the
anger
of
one
who
though
proverbially
capricious
is
by
no
means
unkindly
let
us
glance
at
the
ceremony
as
performed
on
a
tuesday
night
towards
the
middle
of
the
month
of
propitiation
in
the
darkest
portion
of
the
stands
a
rude
hut
containing
the
emblems
of
the
mother
occupied
for
the
time
being
by
rama
bhandari
who
acts
as
a
species
of
medium
between
the
goddess
and
his
kinsmen
in
front
of
the
hut
a
space
has
been
cleared
and
levelled
flanked
on
one
side
by
mats
for
the
bhandari
musicians
singers
drummers
and
and
on
the
other
by
four
or
five
chairs
and
a
few
wooden
benches
for
the
initiates
in
the
mysteries
and
to
the
stems
of
several
neighbouring
trees
lamps
have
been
affixed
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
which
cast
weird
shadows
across
the
threshold
of
the
goddess
home
rama
the
of
this
woodland
rite
a
dark
thin
man
with
a
look
of
anxiety
upon
his
face
enters
the
hut
with
his
assistant
govind
while
several
fresh
looking
bhandari
boys
take
up
their
position
near
the
gong
cymbals
and
drum
prepared
when
the
hour
comes
to
hammer
them
with
might
and
main
a
pause
and
rama
returns
bearing
the
symbol
or
idol
of
the
mother
followed
by
govind
carrying
a
lighted
the
idol
for
such
we
must
perforce
style
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
bright
brass
pot
full
of
water
set
on
a
wooden
stool
which
is
thickly
covered
with
flowers
in
the
mouth
of
the
rests
a
husked
cocoanut
with
a
hole
in
the
upper
end
into
which
are
thrust
the
stems
of
a
bouquet
of
jasmine
with
long
arms
of
jasmine
hanging
down
on
either
side
now
the
is
the
shrine
the
very
home
of
jarimari
and
the
cholera
mothers
behind
the
stool
govind
places
another
stool
bearing
a
tin
tray
full
of
uncooked
rice
camphor
and
black
and
red
scented
powder
and
close
to
it
he
piles
the
cocoanuts
sugar
camphor
cakes
and
marigolds
which
the
bhandari
initiates
have
sent
as
an
offering
to
rama
he
next
produces
a
pile
of
cinders
which
he
places
in
front
of
the
goddess
and
several
which
he
lights
while
rama
lays
down
a
handful
of
light
canes
for
use
at
the
forthcoming
ceremony
and
while
the
rich
scented
smoke
rises
in
clouds
into
the
still
shrouding
the
face
govind
takes
a
little
rice
from
the
tray
and
a
few
flowers
and
places
them
on
a
tulsi
or
sweet
basil
shrine
which
stands
a
little
northward
of
the
hut
all
is
now
ready
rama
bids
the
boys
sound
the
note
of
gathering
and
at
once
such
a
clashing
and
drumming
arises
as
would
frighten
all
the
devils
of
the
the
people
come
but
slowly
for
many
of
them
work
late
in
the
mills
and
have
to
go
home
and
cook
and
eat
their
before
they
can
take
part
in
the
rites
of
the
mother
but
at
last
groups
of
women
appear
out
of
the
darkness
bareheaded
save
for
and
a
few
gold
ornaments
their
saris
wound
tightly
round
waist
and
shoulder
they
cluster
silent
and
round
the
door
of
the
hut
for
they
are
the
women
whom
the
mothers
love
to
possess
and
to
lash
into
the
divine
frenzy
which
only
the
human
form
can
adequately
portray
govind
stirs
the
the
dense
smoke
rolls
forth
again
and
shrouds
all
there
is
a
feeling
of
witchery
in
the
air
and
in
the
midst
of
the
one
can
just
descry
rama
bending
low
before
the
mother
now
he
rises
draws
the
through
his
hands
and
then
leans
against
a
with
eyes
tightly
closed
and
hands
quivering
as
if
in
pain
but
hark
there
is
something
toward
in
the
hut
and
out
of
the
darkness
dash
two
young
women
right
in
front
of
the
goddess
leaping
and
tossing
their
arms
they
sway
and
twist
their
lithe
forms
in
the
smoke
but
utter
no
word
only
one
can
see
their
breasts
heaving
beneath
the
sari
and
can
catch
the
sharp
hoo
hoo
of
their
breathing
as
their
frenzy
heightens
now
from
the
other
end
of
the
hut
two
more
rush
forth
staggering
towards
the
tulsi
shrine
and
after
the
same
mad
gyrations
dance
towards
the
mother
and
bury
their
heads
in
the
smoke
and
they
are
followed
at
momentary
intervals
by
others
who
fly
some
to
the
tulsi
shrine
others
to
the
goddess
but
all
mad
with
frenzy
dancing
leaping
swaying
until
they
sink
overpowered
by
fatigue
meanwhile
rama
is
performing
a
devil
dance
of
his
own
in
the
the
gong
is
ringing
cymbals
clashing
onlookers
shouting
the
tresses
of
the
women
have
fallen
down
and
in
the
look
like
black
snakes
writhing
in
torture
the
women
themselves
are
as
mad
as
the
bacchantes
and
menads
of
old
fable
in
a
word
it
is
pandemonium
let
loose
the
noise
ebbs
and
flows
now
dying
down
as
the
first
frenzy
fades
away
now
rising
more
shrill
as
the
spirit
of
the
mother
wracks
her
devotees
more
fiercely
that
tall
young
woman
who
dances
like
a
puppet
without
will
and
who
never
seems
to
tire
is
moti
leader
of
the
dancers
and
the
favourite
choice
of
jarimari
there
behind
her
is
ganga
the
beloved
of
devi
and
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
swaying
is
godavari
lashed
to
madness
by
mother
ankai
around
them
dance
by
twos
and
threes
the
rest
of
the
women
with
dishevelled
locks
and
loosened
robes
whom
rama
taps
from
time
to
time
with
his
cane
whenever
they
show
signs
of
giving
in
but
at
length
nature
reasserts
her
sway
and
the
dancers
one
and
all
crouch
down
in
the
smoke
their
dark
sides
heaving
painfully
in
the
dim
light
like
the
implements
of
some
ghostly
forge
now
govind
appears
again
with
a
tray
and
marks
the
brows
of
the
women
with
a
of
vermilion
his
own
brow
being
marked
by
them
in
turn
he
places
a
cake
of
camphor
on
the
tray
and
sets
light
to
it
and
as
the
clear
flame
bursts
forth
in
front
of
the
mother
the
whole
congregation
rises
and
shouts
devi
ki
jaya
victory
to
the
goddess
then
moti
takes
the
tray
and
balancing
it
on
her
head
dances
slowly
with
long
swinging
stride
round
the
mother
while
the
music
bursts
out
with
renewed
vigour
urging
the
other
women
the
human
tabernacles
of
the
cholera
deities
to
follow
suit
thereafter
the
is
handed
round
to
both
women
and
men
in
turn
who
plunge
their
hands
in
the
ashes
and
smear
their
faces
with
them
and
so
after
distribution
of
the
offering
of
cocoanuts
sugar
and
betel
the
celebration
closes
a
few
girls
still
dance
and
jerk
their
shining
bodies
before
the
altar
but
rama
who
is
getting
weary
touches
them
with
his
hands
commanding
the
frenzy
to
cease
and
with
a
sigh
they
withdraw
one
by
one
into
the
dark
shadows
of
the
such
is
in
brief
the
ceremony
of
propitiation
of
the
what
does
it
signify
it
appears
that
according
to
bhandari
belief
the
disease
is
the
outcome
of
neglect
of
the
mother
the
present
conditions
of
life
in
the
cramped
and
fetid
chawls
of
the
city
the
long
hours
of
work
necessitated
by
higher
rentals
and
a
higher
standard
of
living
leave
her
devotees
but
little
leisure
for
her
worship
she
is
maddened
by
neglect
and
in
revenge
she
slays
her
ten
or
fifteen
in
a
night
yet
is
she
not
by
nature
cruel
fashion
for
her
a
pleasant
shrine
burn
incense
before
her
beat
the
drum
in
her
honour
let
the
women
offer
themselves
as
the
sport
and
of
her
madness
and
of
a
surety
will
she
repent
her
of
the
evil
she
hath
done
and
will
stay
the
slaughter
in
a
woman
chosen
by
the
spirit
into
whom
as
into
a
shrine
the
mother
enters
is
known
as
a
jhad
or
tree
for
just
as
a
tree
yields
rustling
and
quivering
to
the
lightest
breath
of
the
gale
bends
its
head
and
moves
its
branches
to
and
fro
so
the
women
losing
all
consciousness
of
self
play
as
the
breath
of
the
mother
stirs
them
quivering
beneath
her
gentler
gusts
bending
their
bodies
and
tossing
their
arms
beneath
the
stronger
blasts
and
casting
themselves
low
with
bowed
heads
and
streaming
hair
as
the
full
force
of
the
storm
enwraps
them
they
are
in
very
truth
as
trees
shaken
by
the
wind
nay
more
the
mother
herself
once
lived
in
human
form
she
knows
the
pleasure
the
comforts
of
the
body
and
she
is
fain
by
entering
the
bodies
of
her
female
devotees
to
renew
the
memories
and
suggestions
of
her
former
life
in
conclusion
one
may
briefly
record
what
the
bhandaris
thought
of
the
presence
of
a
european
at
their
sacred
rite
some
feared
him
as
one
that
contemplated
the
imposition
of
a
new
tax
others
viewed
him
askance
as
a
doctor
from
the
hospital
despatched
by
higher
authority
to
put
an
end
to
the
ceremony
and
yet
others
the
larger
number
insooth
deemed
that
here
at
last
was
a
saheb
who
had
found
physic
a
failure
and
had
learned
that
the
mother
alone
has
power
to
allay
grievous
sickness

a

the
road
leading
from
mahalakshmi
to
the
shrine
of

is
particularly
gay
and
the
vellard
is
lined
throughout
its
entire
length
with
carriages
full
of
men
women
and
children
in
their
finest
attire
while
under
the
palms
on
the
east
side
of
the
road
the
hum
of
a
great
crowd
is
broken
from
time
to
time
by
the
cry
of
the
sellers
of
sweets
toasted
grain
parched
pistachio
nuts
and
salted
almonds
or
by

of
the

a

crowd
it
is
free
from
all
signs
of
quarrelling
and
excess
packed
more
densely
than
usual
around
the
shrine
of
mama
hajiyani
where
every
little
vacant
space
is
monopolised
by
rounds
and
by
the
booths
of
bakers
and
here
are
men
playing
cards
others
are
flying
kites
many
are
thronging
the
tea

stalls
while
in
the
very
heart
of
the

wander
jewish

to

their

and
their

mendicants
elbow

at

mahomedan

turn
a

to
the

those
whom
they
persecute
for

many
of
the
carry
packets
of
basil
leaves
and
flowers
which
they
place
upon
the
grave
of
the

silently
repeating
as
they
do
so
the
or
prayers
for
the
dead
others
more
puritanical
perchance
more
sceptical
utter
not
their
prayers
to
the
grave
but
as
the
words
pass
their
lips
turn
their
faces
seawards
remembering
holy
mecca
in
the
far
west
glance
for
a
minute
within
the
room
that
enshrines
the
tomb
and
you
will
see
the
walls
hung
with
tiny
toy
cradles
the
votive
offerings
of
heartsick
women
from
whom
the
grace
of
mama
hajiyani
has
lifted
the
curse
of
childlessness
so
as
the
sun
sinks
you
pass
back
from
the
peace
of
the
mother
pilgrim
grave
to
the
noise
of
the
crowd
and
turning
homewards
you
hear
above
you
the
message
of
the
green
parrakeets
skimming
towards
the
tomb
like
a
flight
of
emerald
arrows
stolen
from
the
golden
quiver
of
the
twilight
a
bombay
mosque
who
does
not
know
the
mahomedan
quarters
of
the
city
of
bombay
with
their
serried
ranks
of
mansions
extending
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
dark
and
forbidding
seem
many
of
these
houses
and
to
few
is
it
given
to
know
the
secrets
they
enshrine
but
these
square
battalions
of
brick
and
plaster
are
not
wholly
continuous
for
here
and
there
the
ranks
are
broken
by
the
plain
and
porch
or
by
the
glistening
domes
and
minarets
of
a
mosque
and
at
such
points
one
may
if
one
so
wish
see
more
of
the
people
who
dwell
in
the
silent
houses
than
one
could
hope
to
see
during
the
course
of
a
month
peregrinations
up
and
down
the
streets
devoted
to
the
followers
of
the
prophet
stand
with
me
at
sundown
opposite
the
gateway
of
the
mosque
and
watch
the
stream
of
worshippers
flowing
in
through
the
portals
of
the
house
of
prayer
here
are
the
rich
merchants
of
persia
clad
in
their
long
black
coats
there
the
maulavis
behind
them
come
smart
sepoys
hailing
from
northern
india
memon
traders
and
jats
from
multan
nor
is
our
friend
the
dark
sidi
wanting
to
the
throng
and
he
is
followed
by
the
arab
with
his
by
the
handsome
afghan
and
by
the
shouldered
native
of
bokhara
in
his
heavy
robes

too
the
hurried
steps
of
the
from

and
note
the
contrast
of
colour
as
the
grimy
fitter
or
passes
through
the
porch
side
by
side
with
the
konkani
musulman
whose
high
features
and
olive
skin
betray
his
origin
rich
and
poor
clean
and
unclean
all
pass
in
to
prayer
as
the
concourse
increases
the
shoes
of
the
faithful
gather
in
heaps
along
the
inner
edge
of
the
porch
only
the
newer
shoes
are
permitted
to
lie
sole
against
sole
close
to
their
owners
each
of
whom
after
washing
in
the
shaded
cistern
takes
his
place
in
the
hindmost
line
of
worshippers
as
the
service
proceeds
the
ranks
of
the
congregation
kneel
stand
fall
prostrate
and
press
the
brow
upon
the
ground
with
a
rhythm
so
reverential
and
so
dignified
that
the
watcher
forgets
for
a
time
the
torn
or
tawdry
raiment
the
grime
of
the
factory
the
dust
of
the
streets
and
feels
that
each
fresh
attitude
of
devotion
is
indeed
the
true
posture
of
prayer
it
is
as
a
sea
troubled
by
the
breath
of
some
unseen
spirit
wave
upon
wave
rising
bending
and
finally
casting
itself
low
in
humility
and
sacrifice
at
the
very
footstool
of
the
most
high
but
all
the
worshippers
are
men
where
are
the
women
you
ask
do
they
not
repeat
the
daily
prayers
also
verily
yes
replies
our
guide
they
are
all
praying
in
their
homes
at
this
hour
more
regular
more
reverent
are
they
than
we
are
and
if
we
men
but
prayed
as
the
women
pray
no
shadow
would
dim
the
brightness
of
islam
illustration
an
arab
as
the
progresses
groups
of
men
and
women
with
children
in
their
arms
gather
at
the
main
entrance
of
the
mosque
for
the
children
are
vexed
with
sickness
against
which
medicine
has
availed
nought
and
in
a
higher
healing
lies
their
only
chance
of
recovery
so
as
the
congregation
passes
out
through
the
gateway
the
parents
hold
out
their
ailing
children
and
every
worshipper
rich
or
poor
young
or
old
turning
his
face
downwards
lets
his
breath
pass
over
the
face
of
the
sick
child
that
needs
his
aid
a
picturesque
custom
is
this
which
illustrates
two
ancient
and
universal
beliefs
namely
that
all
disease
is
and
that
the
holy
book
is
he
who
repeats
the
inspired
words
of
the
koran
is
purged
of
all
evil
and
his
breath
alone
surcharged
with
the
utterances
of
divinity
has
power
to
cast
out
the
devils
of
sickness
thus
to
this
day
all
classes
of
mahomedans
but
particularly
the
lower
classes
carry
their
sick
children
to
the
mosques
to
receive
the
breath
of
the
musallis
and
sometimes
in
cases
of
grievous
disease
a
pir
or
mashaikh
is
asked
to
perform
the
healing
office
prefacing
the
brief
ceremony
with
that
famous
verse
of
the
koran
wa
minal
kuraani
ma
huwa
shifaun
wa
rah
matun
lil
moaminina
which
being
interpreted
means
we
send
down
from
the
koran
that
which
is
a
cure
and
a
mercy
unto
true
believers
so
the
mosques
of
the
city
are
homes
of
healing
as
well
as
of
prayer
occasionally
when
the
of
the
ordinary
worshipper
has
failed
to
effect
a
cure
a
mussulman
mother
will
take
her
sick
child
to
some
syed
or
other
holy
man
in
the
city
for
what
she
calls
jhada
dalwana
the
the
syed
questions
her
about
the
symptoms
and
duration
of
the
disease
ay
me
moans
the
mother
i
can
not
say
what
ails
the
child
syed
saheb
he
was
full
of
life
and
health
till
the
other
day
when
i
left
him
on
the
threshold
sucking
a
sweetmeat
there
came
by
an
old
wagri
woman
who
stared
at
him
whining
for
alms
i
gave
her
a
little
bread
wishing
her
well
away
but
alack
no
sooner
had
she
gone
than
my
child
sickened
and
hath
not
recovered
since
the
syed
then
asks
her
to
drop
a
pice
upon
a
paper
covered
with
magic
squares
which
being
done
he
consults
a
manuscript
and
decides
that
the
child
is
a
victim
of
the
evil
eye
accordingly
he
proceeds
to
pass
the
end
of
a
twisted
handkerchief
seven
times
over
the
child
body
murmuring
at
the
same
time
certain
mystic
formulae
which
he
as
it
were
blows
over
the
child
from
head
to
foot
this
operation
is
performed
daily
for
three
or
four
days
after
which
in
many
cases
the
child
actually
gets
better
and
the
mother
in
gratitude
pays
the
syed
from
eight
annas
to
a
rupee
for
his
kind
offices
so
too
it
is
the
syed
and
the
prayers
he
breathes
which
exorcise
the
spirit
of
hysteria
that
so
often
lays
hold
of
young
maidens
and
it
is
likewise
the
breath
of
the
devout
man
which
fortifies
the
souls
of
them
that
have
journeyed
unto
the
turnstiles
of
night

memon
and
rangari
illustration
a
bombay
memon
would
you
learn
how
the
memon
and
the
rangari
two
of
the
most
notable
inhabitants
of
the
city
pass
the
waking
hours
they
are
early
risers
as
a
rule
and
are
ready
to
repair
to
the
nearest
mosque
directly
the
call
to
prayer
breaks
the
silence
of
the
approaching
dawn
and
when
the
prayers
are
over
they
return
to
a
frugal
breakfast
of
bread
soaked
in
milk
or
tea
and
then
open
their
shops
for
the
day
business
if
his
trade
permits
it
the
memon
will
himself
go
taking
with
him
a
jambil
or
basket
of
in
which
to
place
his
vegetables
his
green
spices
his
meat
and
a
little
of
such
fruit
as
may
be
in
season
his
other
requisites
flour
pulse
sugar
and
molasses
come
to
him
in
what
he
calls
his
khata
his
account
with
a
neighbouring
he
is
by
no
means
beloved
of
the
bombay
for
he
is
strict
in
his
observance
of
the
sunna
which
bids
him
haggle
till
his
forehead
perspires
just
as
it
did
in
winning
the
money
the
bombay
commences
by
asking
an
exorbitant
price
for
his
commodities
our
memon
retorts
by
offering
the
least
they
could
possibly
fetch
and
the
battle
between
the
maximum
and
the
minimum
eventually
settles
itself
somewhere
about
the
golden
mean
whereupon
the
memon
hies
him
homewards
as
full
of
satisfaction
as
thackeray
jew
in
many
cases
the
mother
of
the
house
or
the
sister
if
old
widowed
and
in
the
words
of
the
koran
despairing
of
a
marriage
performs
the
business
of
shopping
and
proves
herself
no
less
adept
than
her
kinsman
at
driving
a
bargain
about
the
memon
or
rangari
has
his
chief
meal
consisting
of
leavened
or
unleavened
bread
meat
curry
or
stew
or
two
kababs
or
fried
fish
followed
perhaps
by
mangoes
when
in
season
and
when
this
is
over
he
indulges
in
a
siesta
whenever
his
business
allows
of
it
the
afternoon
prayers
are
followed
by
to
business
which
keeps
him
busy
in
his
shop
until
or
when
he
again
returns
home
to
a
frugal
supper
of
khichdi
it
is
hardly
a
satisfying
meal
and
many
young
memons
indulge
in
a
fresh
collation
before
retiring
to
rest
the
khichdi
finished
the
young
members
of
the
family
set
forth
for
their
evening
resorts
nor
forbear
to
take
such
refreshment
as
the
city
offers
on
their
journey
they
purchase
a
glass
of
here
accept
a
cup
of
tea
offered
by
a
friend
there
or
purchase
a
tumbler
of
faludah
which
plays
the
same
part
in
the
mahomedan
life
of
bombay
as
macaroni
does
in
the
life
of
the
neapolitan
it
consists
of
cooked
and
allowed
to
cool
in
large
and
sold
at
the
corners
of
mahomedan
streets
on
receiving
a
demand
the
cuts
out
a
slice
from
the
seemingly
frozen
mass
puts
it
into
a
large
tumbler
mixes
sugar
and
sherbet
with
it
and
then
hands
it
to
his
customer
who
swallows
the
mixture
with
every
sign
of
deep
satisfaction
if
possessed
of
a
conveyance
the
memon
will
drive
about
sunset
to
the
apollo
bunder
breach
candy
or
the
bandstand
happy
possessor
of
a
tolerably
decent
horse
and
victoria
he
considers
himself
above
the
conventionalities
of
dress
and
thus
may
be
seen
in
the
long
white
shirt
and
trousers
which
constitute
his
shop
or
attended
not
infrequently
by
little
miniatures
of
himself
in
similar
garb
reaching
the
bunder
he
silences
the
importunity
of
the
children
by
a
liberal
purchase
of
salted
almonds
and
pistachios
or
grain
fried
in
oil
and
passes
an
hour
or
so
in
discussing
with
a
friend
the
of
grain
cotton
or
indigo
if
young
the
memon
and
rangari
is
fond
of
the
native
theatres
where
he
rewards
parsi
histrionic
talent
by
assiduous
attention
and
exclamations
of
approval
he
and
his
friends
break
their
journey
home
by
a
visit
to
an
irani
or
shop
where
they
repeat
the
monotonous
strain
of
the
theatre
songs
and
assure
themselves
of
the
happiness
of
the
moment
by
asking
one
another
again
and
again
kevi
majha
what
bliss
to
which
comes
the
reply
ghani
majha
or
sari
majha
great
bliss
then
perhaps
if
the
night
is
still
young
they
will
knock
up
the
household
of
a
singer
and
demand
a
song
or
two
from
her
phryne
can
not
refuse
however
late
the
hour
may
be
but
she
has
her
revenge
by
charging
a
very
high
price
for
her
songs
which
her
ustads
or
musicians
take
care
to
pocket
beforehand
home
is
at
length
reached
and
there
after
a
final
supper
of
malai
ke
piyale
cups
of
cream
and
eggs
the
young
memon
disappears
until
the
morrow
the
older
and
more
settled
members
of
the
community
amuse
themselves
till
by
congregating
in
the
tea
and
coffee
shops
of
the
city
and
there
discussing
the
general
trend
of
trade
others
have
formed
unions
which
assemble
at
the
house
of
each
member
in
turn
and
spend
a
few
hours
in
singing
the
maulud
or
hymns
on
the
birth
of
the
prophet
upon
whom
be
peace
these
hymns
in
pure
hejazi
verse
are
sung
in
different
measures
and
are
not
unpleasant
to
the
ear
at
a
distance
another
peculiar
memon
custom
is
the
for
rain
a
number
of
men
and
boys
assemble
about
in
the
street
and
sing
chants
set
to
music
by
some
poet
of
gujarat
or
hindustan
the
chants
are
really
prayers
to
god
for
rain
for
forgiveness
of
sins
and
for
absolution
from
ingratitude
for
former
bounties
one
with
a
strong
voice
sings
the
recitative
and
then
the
chorus
breaks
in
with
the
words
order
o
lord
the
of
thy
mercy
thus
chanting
the
company
wanders
from
street
to
street
till
midnight
and
continues
the
practice
nightly
until
the
rain
falls
a
rangari
betrothal
though
simple
enough
in
itself
contains
certain
elements
of
interest
the
father
of
the
bridegroom
usually
informs
the
patel
of
the
caste
that
his
son
betrothal
will
take
place
on
a
certain
day
and
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
bridegroom
retinue
accompanied
by
the
patel
and
various
friends
and
relations
journeys
to
the
house
of
the
bride
after
the
company
has
fully
assembled
someone
brings
forward
a
cocoanut
on
a
tray
with
a
few
copper
coins
beside
it
the
patel
then
asks
why
the
cocoanut
has
been
brought
to
which
one
of
the
bride
supporters
replies
it
is
for
the
betrothal
of
the
daughter
of
zeid
with
omar
this
feature
of
the
ceremony
is
obviously
of
hindu
origin
and
must
be
a
legacy
of
the
days
when
the
rangaris
not
yet
converted
to
islam
belonged
to
the
hindu
khatri
or
kshattriya
caste
of
gujarat
and
cutch
for
the
loose
copper
coins
which
till
recently
were
styled
must
be
lingering
remnants
of
the
brahman
dakshina

among
hindus
from

ages
cocoanuts
have
been

by
the

as
earnest
of
an
offer
of
marriage
sometimes
in
token
of
acceptance
after

ceremony
is
complete
the
parties
can
not
retract
the
ceremony
being
considered
equivalent
to
a
nikah

actual
registration
by
the
kazi

this
fact
again
discovers
the
hindu
origin
of
the
mahomedan

of
their
customs

among
foreign
musulmans

betrothal

among
the
most
curious
of
the
modern
portions
of

city
one
may
reckon
madanpura
which
lies
off
ripon
road
and
is
commonly
known
as
the
home
of
the
julhais
or
muhammadan
weavers
from
northern
india
it

up
every

amongst
those
who
like
the
julhais

are
the

who
supply
the
steamship
companies
with
stokers
firemen
and
assistants
and
the
dockyards
and
workshops
with
fitters
and
mechanics
a
hardy
race
they
are
with
their
muscular
frames
thick
lips
and
crisp
black
hair
the
very
last
men
you
would
wish
to
meet
in
a
and
yet
withal
a
jovial
people
and
hospitable
to
anyone
whom
they
regard
as
a
friend
if
they
trust
you
fully
they
will
give
you
to
witness
one
of
their
periodical
dances
in
which
both
sexes
participate
and
which
commencing
about
usually
last
until
or
the
following
morning
they
are
worth
seeing
once
if
only
for
the
sake
of
learning
how
the
sidis
amuse
themselves
when
the
spirit
moves
them
imagine
a
bare
room
opening
directly
upon
the
street
the
walls
of
which
boast
of
no
ornament
save
a
row
of
and
the
sides
and
window
ledges
of
which
are
lined
with
an
expectant
crowd
of
sidis
of
varying
age
from
the
small
boy
of
eight
years
to
the
elderly
headman
or
patel
who
is
responsible
for
the
good
behaviour
of
the
community
and
is
the
general
arbiter
of
their
internal
disputes
this
is
the
sidi
jamatkhana
or
and
long
before
you
reach
the
door
threading
your
way
through
a
crowd
of
squatting
hawkers
your
ears
are
assailed
by
the
most
deafening
noise
reminding
you
forcibly
of
the
coppersmith
bazaar
with
an
accompaniment
of
rythmic
drumming
the
cause
is
not
far
to
seek
in
the
centre
of
the
room
two
sidis
are
sitting
in
fashion
astride
what
appear
to
be
wooden
imitations
of
a
cannon
and
beating
the
covered
mouths
of
their
with
their
hands
at
their
feet
a
third
sidi
is
playing
a
kind
of
upon
a
flattened
kerosine
and
in
the
corner
with
his
back
to
the
audience
an
immense
african
an
ebony
pan
blowing
frenzy
through
his
wide
lips
is
forcing
the
whole
weight
of
his
lungs
into
a
narrow
reed
pipe
the
noise
is
phenomenal
overpowering
but
is
plainly
attractive
to
sidi
ears
for
the
room
is
rapidly
filling
and
more
than
one
of
the
spectators
suddenly
leaps
from
his
seat
and
circles
round
the
drummers
keeping
time
to
the
rythm
with
queer
movements
of
his
body
and
feet
and
whirling
a
lathi
round
his
head
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
the
proverbial
irishman
at
donneybrook
fair
meanwhile
there
is
some
movement
toward
in
the
of
the
inner
room
from
time
to
time
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
black
immobile
and
framed
in
scarves
bearing
a
bold
pattern
of
red
monkeys
and
blue
and
as
the
din
increases
the
owners
of
those
inscrutable
faces
creep
out
and
sink
down
upon
a
strip
of
china
matting
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
they
are
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
community
some
of
them
young
and
from
the
sidi
point
of
view
good
to
look
upon
others
emulating
the
elephant
in
bulk
but
all
preternaturally
solemn
and
immovable
here
and
there
among
the
faces
you
miss
the
known
type
the
thick
prominent
lips
yield
place
to
more
delicate
mouths
the
shapeless
nose
to
the
slightly
aquiline
for
there
are
here
who
take
more
after
their
indian
fathers
than
their
african
mothers
and
who
serve
as
a
living
example
of
the
tricks
that
nature
can
play
in
the
intermingling
of
races
illustration
sidis
of
bombay
and
now
the
piper
in
the
corner
sets
up
a
wilder
strain
the
drummers
work
till
their
muscles
crack
now
looking
as
if
they
were
undergoing
torture
now
turning
to
have
a
joke
with
a
fresh
arrival
until
the
tension
reaches
and
with
a
shout
some
ten
men
dash
forward
and
forming
a
ring
round
the
musicians
commence
the
wild
bomo
dance
even
as
their
savage
ancestors
were
wont
to
do
in
past
ages
round
the
of
africa
watch
them
as
they
move
round
they
are
obviously
inspired
by
the
noise
and
are
bent
heart
and
soul
upon
encouraging
the
laggards
to
join
in
one
of
them
as
he
passes
shouts
out
that
he
sails
by
the
and
o
dindigul
the
next
day
and
intends
to
make
a
night
of
it
another
is
wearing
the
south
african
medal
and
says
he
earned
it
as
on
a
troopship
from
these
shores
while
a
third
in
deference
to
the
english
guest
gives
vent
at
intervals
to
a
resonant
hip
hip
hurrah
which
almost
drowns
the
unmelodious
efforts
of
the
maestro
with
the
the
bomo
dance
is
followed
with
scarce
a
pause
by
the
lewa
a
kind
of
festal
revel
in
which
the
dancers
move
inwards
and
outwards
as
they
circle
round
and
this
in
turn
yields
place
to
the
bondogaya
and
two
religious
figures
the
damali
and
chinughi
which
are
said
when
properly
performed
to
give
men
the
power
of
divination
long
ere
the
lewa
draws
to
a
close
the
women
have
joined
in
first
two
of
the
younger
women
move
from
the
corner
one
of
them
with
eyes
closed
and
preserving
a
curious
rigidity
of
body
even
while
her
feet
are
rythmically
tapping
the
floor
then
two
more
join
and
so
on
until
the
circumference
of
the
is
expanded
as
far
as
the
size
of
the
room
will
allow
and
not
a
single
woman
is
left
on
the
china
matting
some
of
them
are
as
completely
under
the
spell
of
the
music
as
the
men
but
they
exhibit
little
sign
of
pleasure
or
excitement
on
their
faces
and
were
it
not
for
an
occasional
smile
or
the
weird
shriek
they
raise
at
intervals
one
might
suppose
them
all
to
be
in
a
state
of
hypnotism
perchance
they
are
the
most
vivacious
of
them
all
is
the
old
patelni
who
since
the
death
of
queen
sophie
has
been
in
almost
complete
control
of
the
female
portion
of
the
sidi
community
she
has
no
place
in
the
chain
of
dancing
fanatics
but
stands
in
the
centre
near
the
drummers
now
breaking
into
a
pas
seul
on
her
own
account
now
urging
a
laggard
with
all
the
force
of
a
powerful
vocabulary
beating
time
the
while
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
nearest
drummer
so
the
revel
progresses
sometimes
dying
down
into
a
slow
movement
in
which
only
the
hoarse
breathing
of
the
men
the
of
female
heels
is
heard
and
anon
breaking
into
a
kind
of
gallop
punctuated
with
shouts
of
bravo
hip
hip
hurrah
and
the
queer
dental
shriek
which
our
friendly
serang
tells
us
is
the
peculiar
note
of
the
african
reveller
but
at
length
nature
asserts
her
sway
and
after
the
dancing
has
lasted
almost
without
interruption
for
three
hours
the
sidi
patel
hassan
gives
permission
for
a
brief
recess
during
which
he
introduces
to
the
spectators
the
son
of
the
sidi
chief
makanda
a
fine
specimen
of
manhood
whose
stature
belies
the
fact
that
he
is
still
according
to
sidi
views
a
minor
incapable
of
looking
after
his
own
interests
at
this
juncture
too
an
itinerant
limps
into
the
room
with
his
tin
can
and
cups
and
is
straightway
pounced
upon
by
the
breathless
performers
who
apparently
find
coffee
better
than
any
other
beverage
how
much
you
ask
him
do
you
charge
per
cup
saheb
comes
the
answer
for
two
rupees
you
can
treat
the
whole
gathering
men
women
and
children
to
a
cup
apiece
for
this
coffee
is
of
the
best
so
we
pay
our
footing
in
kind
and
bid
adieu
to
the
dancers
who
are
prepared
to
continue
the
revels
till
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
turn
the
corner
into
ripon
road
we
catch
a
final
glimpse
of
our
bemedalled
serang
executing
a
fandango
on
the
and
of
the
sidi
patel
with
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
in
his
hand
shouting
in
broken
english
god
save
the
king
xiv
a
konkan
legend
legend
and
tradition
have
rendered
many
a
spot
in
india
sacrosanct
for
all
time
and
to
no
tract
perhaps
have
such
traditions
clung
with
greater
tenacity
than
to
the
western
littoral
which
in
the
dawn
of
the
centuries
watched
the
traders
of
the
ancient
world
sail
down
from
the
horizon
to
barter
in
its
ports
as
with
gujarat
and
the
coast
of
kathiawar
so
with
the
konkan
it
is
a
broken
tale
of
strange
arrivals
strange
building
strange
trafficking
in
human
and
inanimate
freight
that
greets
the
student
of
ancient
history
and
bewilders
the
ethnologist
the
konkan
in
which
in
earliest
days
the
beasts
with
man
divided
empire
claimed
and
which
itself
is
dowered
with
a
legendary
origin
not
wholly
dissimilar
in
kind
from
the
story
of
rameses
iii
and
his
naval
conquest
offers
a
fair
sample
of
these
myths
in
the
tale
of
the
arrival
of
the
chitpavans
at
chiplun
in
ratnagiri
for
so
runs
the
tale
on
a
day
long
buried
in
the
abyss
of
time
it
chanced
that
a
terrific
storm
gathered
over
the
western
waters
and
as
night
drew
on
the
sky
black
with
serried
ranks
of
clouds
burst
into
sharp
jets
of
fire
the
rain
poured
forth
in
torrents
unquenchable
and
the
shriek
of
a
mighty
whirlwind
mingling
with
the
deep
echoes
of
indra
thunder
drowned
even
the
roar
of
the
seas
among
the
ships
abroad
on
that
night
was
one
of
strange
device
with
high
peaked
prow
manned
by
a
crew
of
and
men
which
was
forging
its
way
from
a
northern
port
to
some
fair
city
of
southern
india
and
when
the
storm
struck
her
she
was
not
many
miles
from
what
we
now
call
the
ratnagiri
coast
bravely
did
she
battle
with
the
tempest
bravely
did
her
men
essay
to
keep
her
on
her
course
bringing
to
play
their
hereditary
knowledge
of
their
innate
dexterity
of
brain
but
all
their
scheming
all
their
courage
proved
fruitless
as
a
bridegroom
of
old
time
scattering
the
bridal
procession
by
the
might
of
a
powerful
right
arm
the
sea
swept
away
her
protectors
and
carried
her
lone
and
defenceless
on
to
the
shore
and
when
morning
broke
surya
rising
red
above
the
eastern
hills
watched
the
hungry
waves
cast
up
beside
her
fourteen
white
corpses
the
remnants
of
her
crew
silent
suppliants
for
the
last
great
rites
which
open
to
man
the
passage
into
the
next
world
now
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
the
dark
people
that
dwelt
upon
the
marge
of
the
sea
fared
shorewards
and
found
the
mariners
lying
dead
beside
their
vessel
and
they
marvelling
greatly
what
manner
of
men
these
might
have
been
took
counsel
among
themselves
and
decided
to
bestow
upon
them
the
last
rites
of
the
dead
so
they
built
a
mighty
funeral
pyre
for
them
with
logs
of
resinous
wood
hewn
in
the
dark
forest
that
stretched
inland
and
they
fortified
the
souls
of
the
dead
seamen
with
prayer
and
lamentation
but
lo
a
miracle
for
as
the
flames
hissed
upwards
purging
the
bodies
of
all
earthly
taint
life
returned
to
them
by
the
grace
of
parashurama
and
they
rose
one
and
all
from
the
pyre
and
praised
him
of
the
axe
in
that
he
had
raised
them
from
the
dead
and
made
them
truly
or
the
pyre
purified
and
they
dwelt
henceforth
in
the
land
of
the
arrow
of
their
deliverer
and
were
at
peace
forgetting
their
former
home
and
their
drear
wandering
over
the
pathless
sea
and
taking
perchance
unto
themselves
wives
from
among
the
ancient
holders
of
the
soil
now
the
place
where
they
abode
is
called
chittapolana
or
chiplun
unto
this
day
illustration
parashurama
and
the
chitpavans
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fulness
of
time
as
the
tells
that
parashurama
called
all
brahmans
to
a
great
festival
in
the
new
land
which
he
had
created
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
but
the
hearkened
not
to
his
words
whereas
the
god
waxing
wroth
determined
to
create
new
brahmans
who
would
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
his
counsel
revolving
this
decision
in
his
heart
he
walked
down
to
the
shore
and
there
in
the
he
met
a
and
fair
to
look
upon
and
asked
them
who
they
were
and
whence
they
came
fishermen
or
hunters
are
we
they
answered
and
dwell
upon
the
seashore
sixty
families
of
us
in
all
and
the
god
was
pleased
with
them
and
raising
them
to
the
rank
of
brahmans
divided
them
into
fourteen
gotras
and
made
them
a
solemn
promise
that
should
they
ever
call
him
to
mind
in
any
real
emergency
he
would
come
to
their
assistance
so
they
dwelt
for
many
a
day
waxing
by
the
favour
of
god
both
numerous
and
learned
until
by
they
hearkened
into
evil
counsel
and
called
upon
the
god
without
just
reason
and
he
when
he
learned
what
they
had
done
was
exceeding
wroth
and
cursed
them
dooming
them
to
sorrow
and
to
the
service
of
other
men
so
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
should
endure
thus
the
chitpavans
gained
their
brahmanhood
but
lost
their
right
to
superiority
in
that
they
flouted
the
promise
of
their
god
such
are
the
legends
popular
and
puranic
of
the
coming
of
the
chitpavans
to
western
india
that
some
historic
truth
lies
below
the
garbled
tale
of
shipwreck
and
resurrection
is
partly
proved
by
the
physical
traits
of
their
descendants
of
those
men
in
fact
whose
immediate
ancestors
employed
at
first
as
messengers
or
spies
of
maratha
chieftains
by
innate
cleverness
tact
and
faculty
for
management
gradually
welded
together
the
loose
maratha
confederacy
and
became
directors
of
the
internal
and
external
politics
of
the
peshwa
dominions
for
to
this
day
the
true
chitpavan
perserves
the
fair
skin
the
strange
grey
eyes
the
aspect
of
refined
strength
and
intelligence
which
must
have
characterized
the
shipwrecked
mariners
of
old
fable
and
marked
them
out
in
later
years
as
strangers
in
a
strange
land
but
whence
came
they
these
foreign
immigrants
who
after
long
sojourn
in
the
country
of
their
adoption
moved
upwards
to
the
deccan
and
stood
within
the
shadow
of
the
peshwa
throne
much
has
been
written
of
their
origin
much
that
is
but
empty
theory
but
as
has
remarked
in
the
columns
of
a
local
journal
the
lesson
to
be
learned
from
their
home
dialect
and
from
their
strange
surnames
gogte
lele
karve
gadre
hingne
and
so
on
is
that
the
chitpavan
brahmans
of
western
india
came
in
legendary
ages
from
gedrosia
kirman
and
the
makran
coast
and
that
prior
to
their
domicile
in
those
latitudes
they
probably
formed
part
of
the
population
of
ancient
egypt
or
africa
that
they
were
once
a
seafaring
and
fishing
people
is
proved
by
the
large
number
of
words
of
oceanic
origin
which
still
characterize
their
while
according
to
the
authority
above
mentioned
the
chandrakant
which
they
recognize
is
not
the
sweating
crystal
of
northern
india
and
ancient
sanskrit
lore
but
a
fossil
coral
found
upon
the
makran
coast
forty
years
ago
rao
saheb
mandlik
remarked
that
the
ancestors
of
the
tribe
probably
came
by
ships
either
from
some
other
port
in
india
or
from
the
opposite
coast
of
africa
and
in
these
later
days
his
theory
is
corroborated
by
general
haig
who
traces
them
back
to
the
great
marts
on
the
indus
and
thence
still
further
back
to
the
persian
gulf
and
egypt
why
or
at
what
date
they
left
the
famous
country
of
the
pharaohs
none
can
say
but
that
these
brahmans
are
descendants
of
such
people
as
the
berbers
who
belonged
of
right
to
the
european
races
seems
the
most
plausible
theory
of
their
origin
yet
put
forward
and
serves
as
an
additional
proof
of
the
enormous
influence
exercised
upon
posterity
by
the
famous
country
of
the
nile
thus
perhaps
the
legend
of
storm
and
shipwreck
is
not
false
but
records
in
poetic
diction
the
arrival
on
these
shores
of
men
who
presumably
had
in
some
degree
inherited
the
genius
of
the
most
famous
and
most
civilized
country
of
prehistoric
ages
and
who
had
by
long
trafficking
in
dangerous
waters
and
by
the
hardships
of
long
migration
acquired
that
and
love
of
mastery
which
has
been
bequeathed
almost
unchanged
to
their
brahmanised
descendants
the
chitpavans
were
indeed
the
children
of
the
storm
and
something
of
the
spirit
of
the
storm
lives
in
them
still
some
trace
is
theirs
of
the
old
obstinacy
which
taught
those
pale
ancestors
to
fight
against
insuperable
forces
until
they
were
cast
naked
and
broken
upon
the
seashore
and
peradventure
the
secret
lesson
of
the
ancient
is
this
that
the
god
of
the
axe
despite
the
curse
is
still
at
hand
to
help
them
along
the
path
to
new
birth
provided
always
that
their
cause
is
fair
that
they
invoke
not
his
aid
for
trivial
or
unjust
ends
and
that
they
have
been
truly
purified
in
the
pyres
of
affliction

nur
so
she
spake
seated
on
the
clean
white
of
the
diwankhana
like
some
delicate
flower
cradled
on
a
crystal
lake
we
had
seen
her
once
before
at
the
house
of
an
indian
friend
who
had
hospitably
invited
a
company
to
witness
her
songs
and
dances
we
had
heard
her
chant
the
subtle
melodies
of
hindustan
and
even
old
english
roundelays
for
the
special
delectation
of
the
english
guests
we
had
remarked
her
delicate
hands
the
great
dark
eyes
the
dainty
profile
the
little
ivory
feet
and
above
all
the
gentle
voice
and
courteous
bearing
and
we
realized
that
nur
jan
had
not
been
bred
to
this
uncurtained
life
but
must
once
have
known
the
care
affection
and
the
gentle
training
of
a
patrician
home
by
what
caprice
of
evil
fortune
had
she
come
to
this
hiring
out
her
voice
and
her
nimble
feet
to
enhance
the
pleasure
of
a
chance
entertainment
far
from
her
own
people
and
from
her
northern
indian
home
what
secret
lay
in
the
song
of
the
frail
maiden
on
the
banks
of
the
jamna
in
the
earnest
request
she
made
to
us
not
to
mention
the
name
of
dead
royalty
before
her
the
mystery
remained
unsolved
for
that
evening
and
it
was
not
till
some
weeks
later
that
the
chances
of
an
official
enquiry
brought
us
face
to
face
again
but
this
time
the
and
bells
had
been
locked
away
and
in
their
stead
we
saw
the
silken
jacket
the
spangled
sari
covered
by
a
diaphanous
black
veil
like
a
thin
cloud
the
summer
heavens
the
necklace
of
pearls
round
the
olive
pillar
of
her
throat
and
above
them
the
calm
face
and
the
wealth
of
dark
hair
that
scorned
all
artificial
adornment
there
she
sat
in
her
own
house
singing
to
two
rich
arabs
and
a
subordinate
agent
of
one
of
the
greatest
rulers
of
asia
while
behind
her
mimi
aged
two
years
the
legacy
of
a
dead
affection
crooned
and
tried
to
clap
her
small
hands
in
rythm
with
her
mother
song
and
in
the
pauses
of
her
singing
while
the
musicians
tightened
their
bows
and
the
silver
was
passed
round
to
her
she
lifted
a
little
way
a
very
little
way
the
curtain
of
the
past
yea
saheb
you
have
rightly
spoken
i
come
of
a
good
family
and
as
a
child
i
was
sent
to
school
in
calcutta
and
learned
your
english
tongue
when
i
grew
to
girlhood
i
determined
to
study
medicine
and
serve
the
women
of
my
faith
as
a
doctor
but
barely
had
i
commenced
the
preliminary
lessons
of
compounding
when
the
trouble
came
upon
our
house
and
my
sister
and
i
were
brought
away
from
the
old
home
to
bombay
and
bidden
to
find
the
wherewithal
to
support
those
to
whom
we
owed
respect
and
affection
saheb
with
us
the
word
of
near
relations
is
law
and
their
support
a
sacred
duty
what
could
we
mahomedan
girls
do
in
a
strange
city
we
had
always
liked
singing
and
had
taken
lessons
in
our
home
and
it
seemed
that
herein
lay
the
only
chance
of
supporting
ourselves
and
others
therefore
not
without
hesitation
not
without
tears
we
bade
adieu
to
the
of
our
people
and
cast
the
pearls
of
our
singing
before
the
public
thus
has
it
been
since
that
day
my
sister
by
has
married
well
and
regained
the
shelter
of
the
curtain
but
i
am
still
unwed
and
must
sing
until
the
end
comes
how
can
i
seek
help
of
my
grandsire
have
i
not
disgraced
his
name
by
adopting
this
life
and
were
i
mean
enough
to
ask
his
favour
would
he
not
first
insist
that
i
become
once
more
i
can
not
live
again
behind
the
screen
for
too
long
have
i
been
independent
the
filly
that
has
once
run
free
cares
not
afterwards
for
the
stall
and
bridle
it
has
been
an
evil
mistake
saheb
but
one
not
of
my
making
i
sometimes
loathe
the
lights
the
tinsel
the
bells
aye
even
the
old
songs
for
they
remind
me
of
what
i
might
have
been
but
for
another
fault
and
of
what
i
am
you
ask
of
mimi
future
so
long
as
i
live
she
never
shall
play
a
part
in
this
work
mated
with
a
good
man
of
mine
own
faith
she
will
never
know
regret
that
is
my
great
wish
saheb
the
issue
lies
with
allah
so
the
tale
ran
on
with
its
accompaniment
of
song
its
suggestion
of
regret
once
in
the
middle
of
a
ballad
a
funeral
passes
in
the

is
not

that
the
song
of

be
heard
upon
the
final
journey
one
more
refrain
one
more
question
on
the
mystery
of
her
birth
and
we
ask
permission
to
depart
offering
at
the
same
time
some
small
token
of
our
approval
of
her
songs
to
which
she
replies
in
the
words
that
commence
this
chapter
we
catch
a
last
glimpse
of
her
bidding
us
in
the
gentle
manner
that
tells
its
own
tale
and

xvi
governor
and
koli
a
fisherman
legend
a
friend
has
supplied
me
with
the
following
quaint
history
of
a
marathi
ballad
which
is
widely
chanted
by
the
lower
classes
in
and
around
bombay
composed
originally
as
a
song
of
it
has
now
lost
its
primary
significance
and
is
sung
by
men
at
their
work
or
by
mothers
hushing
their
children
in
the
dark
alleys
of
the
city
the
verse
runs
thus
nakhwa
koli
jat
bholi
ghara
madhye
dravya
mahamar
topiwalyane
hukum
kela
batliwalyachya
barabar
which
may
be
rudely
interpreted
as
follows
seaman
koli
of
simple
mould
hath
in
his
house
great
store
of
gold
lo
at
the
order
of
topiwala
koli
is
peer
of
batliwala
now
the
word
topiwala
means
an
englishman
and
batliwala
is
a
reference
to
the
first
parsi
baronet
sir
jamsetji
jeejeebhoy
albeit
the
word
is
often
used
as
a
synonym
for
millionaire
in
much
the
same
way
as
shankershet
has
crept
into
marathi
parlance
as
the
equivalent
of
rich
and
prosperous
the
story
which
the
kolis
relate
with
pride
refers
to
the
great
wealth
of
zuran
patel
the
ancestor
of
mahadev
dharma
patel
who
at
this
moment
is
the
headman
and
leader
of
the
christian
kolis
of
bombay
that
zuran
patel
was
a
rich
man
can
be
proved
from
the
ancient
documents
relating
to
the
properties
recently
acquired
by
the
improvement
trust
in
and
around
mandvi
for
his
name
appears
as
chief
owner
in
many
of
them
and
it
seems
clear
that
the
spoils
which
he
gathered
from
the
sea
formed
the
basis
of
a
goodly
heritage
upon
dry
land
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
a
certain
parsi
millionaire
whom
the
composer
of
the
ballad
has
supposed
to
be
sir
jamserji
jeejeebhoy
but
who
was
more
probably
a
member
of
the
great
family
of
wadia
the
original
and
of
the
east
india
company
it
chanced
one
day
that
the
governor
of
bombay
perhaps
lord
falkland
or
lord
elphinstone
wandered
into
mandvi
koliwada
and
came
suddenly
upon
the
parsi
and
the
koli
patel
sitting
in
converse
with
one
another
up
rose
the
parsi
millionaire
and
made
obeisance
but
the
koli
quite
indifferent
and
not
recognising
the
solitary
topiwala
remained
in
his
seat
his
excellency
curiosity
was
aroused
and
asking
the
parsi
the
name
of
his
comrade
he
was
informed
that
the
man
was
a
rich
fisherman
who
from
time
to
time
was
accustomed
to
spread
out
his
piles
of
gold
and
silver
in
the
street
to
dry
and
added
the
parsi
so
simple
and
guileless
is
he
that
the
people
walk
over
the
glittering
heap
with
wax
on
their
feet
thus
robbing
him
in
open
daylight
and
yet
he
does
nought
believing
that
the
pile
of
wealth
must
shrink
even
as
his
piles
of
fish
shrink
when
placed
in
the
sun
to
dry
interested
in
the
man
personality
the
governor
asked
the
parsi
to
introduce
the
patel
to
him
and
enquired
whether
he
would
grant
some
portion
of
his
wealth
to
government
yes
as
much
as
the
government
may
desire
was
the
ready
answer
but
quoth
his
excellency
what
will
you
ask
of
government
in
return
only
this
answered
the
koli
that
government
will
grant
me
the
exclusive
privilege
of
roofing
my
house
with
silver
tiles
after
some
little
discussion
a
compromise
was
effected
and
zuran
patel
received
permission
as
a
special
mark
of
favour
to
place
a
few
copper
tiles
above
his
house
the
house
in
dongri
street
where
mahadev
dharma
patel
now
resides
is
reputed
to
be
the
identical
house
upon
which
the
copper
tiles
were
once
fixed
but
many
alterations
have
taken
place
and
the
tiles
have
disappeared
for
many
years
so
runs
the
tale
they
were
preserved
as
a
sort
of
family
escutcheon
being
taken
off
the
roof
and
fixed
in
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
wall
perhaps
they
were
stolen
perhaps
they
were
worn
away
by
constant
polishing
who
can
say
they
have
passed
beyond
the
realm
of
fact
to
that
of
legend
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
kolis
firmly
believe
the
whole
story
and
add
that
zuran
patel
house
was
the
only
real
in
bombay
at
that
epoch
the
walls
being
built
upon
a
framework
of
iron
girders
and
the
cellar
containing
the
piles
of
silver
being
stouter
than
a
modern
safe
it
seems
not
improbable
that
the
old
cellars
of
mandvi
kolivada
were
originally
the
of
the
fishermen
which
as
building
progressed
and
crowding
set
in
were
enclosed
with
tiles
and
brick
and
mortar
and
utilised
as
such
is
the
history
of
the
quaint
ballad
of
the
english
governor
the
parsi
millionaire
and
the
koli
patel
it
seems
to
us
to
crystallise
the
honourable
connection
and
friendship
which
has
existed
from
the
earliest
days
of
british
rule
in
bombay
between
the
the
parsi
pioneers
of
commerce
and
the
english
government
in
the
person
of
its
highest
representative
it
recalls
to
us
the
days
of
siege
and
warfare
when
the
governor
of
the
struggling
settlement
sought
the
help
of
the
sturdy
fishermen
and
when
rustom
dorabji
put
himself
at
their
head
formed
them
into
a
corps
and
drove
the
sidi
off
the
island
it
recalls
the
action
of
the
honourable
thomas
hodges
in
their
behalf
a
century
and
a
half
ago
and
the
subsequent
confirmation
of
their
ancient
rights
by
sir
james
fergusson
and
sir
bartle
frere
and
lastly
it
represents
a
belief
which
has
attained
almost
the
sanctity
of
religion
in
the
heart
of
kolidom
that
between
themselves
and
the
representative
in
bombay
there
exists
a
bond
of
and
respect
which
dating
as
it
does
from
has
been
welded
firm
by
time

never
be

is
well

not
so
in
an
area
devoted
to
the
shia
population

so
the
beggar
chooses
ali
name

a
convenient
and
fitting
means
of
opening
the
of
both
the
great
musulman
sects

to
a

thieving
even
as

fare
upon

you
catch
the
welcome
call
of
the
vendor
of
jaleibi

who
sells
fried
rarely
in
and
generally
in
oil
and
the
jaleibi
a
sort
of
macaroni
fried
likewise

these
crisp

a
favourite
of

who
finds
himself
thus
saved
the
drudgery
of
cooking
when
he
is
barely
awake
and
when
moreover
he
is
in
a
hurry
to
reach
the
scene
of
his
daily
labours
the
vendor
of
these
dainties
is
truly
a
study
in
oils
and
his
hands
which
serve
the
purpose
of
knife
and
fork

customers
demands
drip
but
not
with
myrrh
though
a
vendor
of
oleaginous
dainties
he
is
himself
far
from
nourished
you
can
see
his
and
count
his
ribs
and
almost
mark
the
beatings
of
his
poor
heart
a
dirty
dhoti
girds
his
loins

upon
his
head
is
a
turban
of
the

questionable
hue

serves
both
as
a

as
a
support
for
his
tray
of

a

of
presenting
himself
every
day
at
the

hour
when
the

of

begin
to
clamour
for
food

the

the

of
making
a

he
is
no
longer
the
embodiment
of
tom
moore
heroic
guebre
this
irani
and
his
apron
forbids
the
suggestion
that
he
has
any
association
with
gao
the
subverter
of
a

and
the
slayer
of
the

zuhhac
he
has
sadly
degenerated
from
the
type
of
his

ancestor
if
he
owns
a
shop
he
combines
the
sale
of
other
commodities
with
the
tea
business
he
has
an
a
sherbet
and
a
department
and
he
touts
for
customers
singing
the
praises
of
hot
and
cold
beverages
in
a
language
redolent
of
persian
it
does
not
pay
him
to
use
fresh
from
kangra
or
china
so
he
purchases
his
stock
from
small
traders
who
in
their
turn
obtain
it
as
a
bargain
from
butlers
or
stewards
the

dry
them

mixing
some

make
up

as
for

he
gets
his
supply
from
the
cheapest
manufacturers
while
his
contains
probably
more
water
than
milk
and
is
flavoured
not
with
vanilla
or
orange
but
with
some
article
which
he
declares
is
a
complete
antidote
against
internal
discomfort
he
prepares
his
tea
la
in
a
samovar
which
compares
favourably
with
his
and
tin
spoons
he
charges
his
customer
from
two
to
four
pice
for
this
delightful
mixture
which
has
a
flavour
of
and
rather
than
of
tea
here
too
comes
the
itinerant
very
often
a
woman
who
hawks
fruit
of
all
kinds
from
the
superior
mango
to
the
acid
karaunda
of
the
ghats
for
the
sale
of
a
place
of
vantage

required
so
she
takes
up
a
strong
position
on
the
roadside
or
on
the
doorstep
of
a
house
and
sets
to
work
to
pick
out
her
best
fruit
and
place
it
on
the
top
of
her
basket
she
is
generally
a
deccani
either
musulman
or
hindu
varying
in
age
from
to
and
is
fully
capable
of
conciliating
the
lord
of
the
bombay
pavements
when
he
somewhat
roughly
commands
her
to
move
on
jemadar
saheb
she
calls
him
and
if
this
flattery
is
insufficient
she
offers
one
of
her
ripest
mangoes
with
a
glance
that
he
can
not
resist
it
is
too
much
for
the
sepoy
he
smiles
and
tramps
off
and
she
holds
her
position
undisturbed
if
she
be
a
hindu
you
will
probably
notice
the
mark
on
her
forehead

immediately
proved
attractive
to
the

inasmuch
as
it
requires
little

been
a
boon
to
many
a

the

from
the
nine

lay
within

we

nor

from
nasika
a
nose
in
allusion
to
the
fate
which
here
overtook
the

tapovan

that

three
of

which
appeal
so
forcibly
to
the

of
the
people
as
the
visible
legacies
of

to
us
the

seem
nothing
by
comparison
with
the
mighty
monuments
of
buddhism

local
wiseacres
have
erroneously
named
the

we
drive
out
in
the
fresh
morning
air
along
the

streaked
by

lines

the

ground
the
hard

stark
hills

solitary
out
of
the
plain
a
congeries
of

fringing
the

the
most

across
the

divides
the

from
the
foot
of
the
easternmost
of

triad

trirashmi

triple
sunbeam
is
the
name
by
which
the
hill
is
known
in
seven
of
the
and
is
held
by
the
learned
pundit
who
wrote
the
account
to
refer
to
its
pyramidal
or
triple
shape
but
is
it
not
conceivable
that
the
hand
which
carved
the
earliest
of
those
priceless
inscriptions
desired
to
designate
the
triad
of
contiguous
hills
as
the
tripla
ray
and
not
the
eastern
hill
alone
in
which
the
caves
have
been
hewn
who
can
tell
when
we
recall
the
almost
unbroken
chain
of
caves
the
shivner
the
ganesh
the
manmoda
and
the
tulja
which
surround
junner
we
suspect
that
the
original
intention
of
those
primeval
devotees
was
to
carve
dwellings
and
chapels
in
all
three
hills
which
thus
would
have
surely
formed
a
triple
beam
of
light
in
honour
of
the
great
master
whom
an
english
missionary
has
characterized
as
one
of
the
grandest
examples
of
denial
and
love
to
humanity
which
the
world
has
ever
produced
a
narrow
and
devious
path
worn
by
the
feet
of
worshipers
leads
upward
to
the
broad
terrace
which
fronts
the
caves
here
you
are
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
peace
inviolate
broods
upon
these
dwellings
of
a
vanished
people
but
turn
your
steps
round
the
western
corner
and
the
boisterous
breeze
will
quickly
chase
you
back
behind
the
sheltering
bulwarks
of
the
hill
of
the
caves
all
except
the
eighteenth

originally

monastic
dwellings

their
makers
gazed
upon

work
and
found
it
good
but
long
after
their
earliest
inmates
had
conquered
desire
and
had
gained
nirvana
for
their
souls
the
followers
of
the
mahayana
school
from
northern
india
took
the
dwellings
for
their
own
use
and
carved
out
of
the
austere
walls
of
their
precursors

those
images
and
idols
which
are
now
the
chief
feature
of
the

figures
of

bodhisattvas
with
their
are
symbols
of
a
later
and
more
idolatrous
form
of
buddhism
and
are
several
centuries
later
than
the
days
when
the
great
monk
sramana
fashioned
the
nineteenth

reign
of
krishna
the
satakarni
nor
has
vandalism
in
the
guise
of
the
mahayana
school
been

at

here
the
tenth
cave
once
contained
a
or
similar
to
the
at
karli
shivner
and
ganesh
lena
but
in
its
place
now
stands
a
hideous
figure
of
bhairav
aflame
with
and
nought
remains
to
testify
to
the
former
presence
of
the
shrine
save
the
buddhist
t
capital
the
umbrellas
and
the
flags
which
surmounted
it
the
eleventh
cave
bears
traces
of
jain
sacrilege
in
the
blue
figure
of
the
tirthankar
or
hierach
who
sits
in
the
back
wall
and
in
the
figure
of
ambika
on
the
right
but
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
the
alteration
of
ancient
monuments
to
suit
the
needs
of
late
comers
is
the
twentieth
cave
where
the
colossal
buddha
who
muses
with
his
attendants
in
the
dense
darkness
of
the
inner
shrine
has
been
smeared
with
black
pigment
and
adorned
with
gold
tinsel
and
is
proudly
introduced
to
you
by
the
local
as
dharmaraja
the
eldest
of
the
five
pandavas
the
surrounding
bodhisattvas
being
metamorphosed
into
nakula
sahadeva
bhima
arjuna
krishna
and
draupadi
the
joint
wife
of
the
five
alas
for
the
perfect
one
in
whose
honour
as
the
inscription
tells
us
the
wife
of
the
great
bhavagopa
commenced
building
the
cave
in
he
has
long
been
forgotten
and
the
hand
which
he
uplifts
in
token
of
the
four
verities
discovered
after
great
agony
and
temptation
beneath
the
tree
of
wisdom
is
now
pointed
out
as
the
wrathful
hand
of
the
of
the
mahabharata
once
and
once
only
in
these
later
days
has
the
buddha
evinced
his
displeasure
at
the
modernization
of
his
ancient
shrine
about
the
year
came
hither
a
bairagi
naked
and
wild
who
walled
off
a
corner
of
the
cave
and
raised
a
clay
altar
to
his
puny
god
sacrilege
intolerable
and
the
buddha
through
the
hand
of
an
avaricious
koli
smote
him
unto
death
and
hurled
his
naked
corpse
down
hill
the
titanic
figure
is
still
worshipped
by
the
hindus
flowers
and
lighted
lamps
are
daily
offered
up
to
him
by
the
ignorant
hindu
priest
but
he
sits
immutable
inarticulate
content
in
the
knowledge
that
to
them
that
have
understanding
his
real
message
of
humanitarianism
speaks
through
the
clouds
of
falsehood
which
now
enwrap
his
presence
much
might
be
written
of
the
strange
medley
of
creeds
which
are
symbolised
in
these
caves
the
nagdevas
with
their
which
are
relics
of
a
primordial
sun
and
serpent
worship
totally
foreign
to
pure
buddhism
appear
side
by
side
with
the
swastika
or
of
the
greater
creed
with
the
lotus
and
other
symbols
of
a
phallic
cult
and
as
in
the
small
cistern
near
cave
with
the
female
face

the
hindu
belief
in
the
divinity
of
the
smallpox
jain
images
of
a
later
school
of
buddhism
dating
from
the
or
century
after
christ
have
helped
to
rob
these
homes
of
buddhist
mendicants
of
their
original
simplicity
and
severity
and
have
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
any
save
the
wise
men
of
the
east
to
read
their
chequered
history
aright
in
almost
the
last
cave
we
entered
where
two
standing
figures
on
the
right
and
left
mount
guard
over
the
image
of
the
master
our
footsteps
roused
a
large
female
rat
and
her
young
which
crawled
up
the
silent
seated
figure
and
took
refuge
on
the
very
crown
of
its
head
sanctuary
so
we
turned
aside
to
scrutinise
the
strange
symbolical
figures
of
the
cave
and
the
stories
of
the
chaste
and
unchaste
wives
which
are
hewn
in
the
ornamental
gateway
of

the
terrace

the

amid
her

opposite
to
it
the
modern
christian
village
of

the
threshold
of
that
tract
of

pride
here

there
a
red
roof
catches
the
sun
rays
and
shews
a

two
tints
the
warm
green
of

grey
of

which

the
memories
of

thousand

of

lastly
of
maratha
who
used
the
hill
as
a
of
warriors
and
bored
holes
in
the
graven
images
for
the
tethering
of
his
cattle
and
steeds
by
some
divine
decree
the
imperial
banditti
kept
their
impious
hands
from
the
famous
inscriptions
which
are
the
real
glory
of
these
caves
and
form
the
between
ourselves
and
that
great
king

face
was
as

and
so
ends
our
morning
exploration
one
last
visit
to
the
silent
keepers
of
these
messages
from
dead
monarchs
and
we
pass
down
to
the
high
road
whence
we
look
back
once
more
upon
trirashmi
the
casket
of
jewels
without
price
and
her
twin
sisters
gleaming
in
the
morning
light
like
the
triple
prongs
of
some
giant
trident
set
there
by
nature
in
honour
of
the
great
apostle
of

we
had
wandered
off
the
main
thoroughfare
where
the
trams
hurtling
past
the
irani
tea
shop
drown
from
time
to
time
the
chatter
of
khoda
clientele
and
skirting
a
group
of
mahomedans
who
nightly
sit
in
solemn
conclave
some
on
the
others
on
charpoys
or
chairs
placed
well
in
the
fairway
of
traffic
we
reached
at
length
a
sombre
and
narrow
seemingly
untenanted
save
by
the
shadows
here
a
sheeted
form
lay
prone
on
the
roadside
there
a
flickering
lamp
disclosed
through
the
door
a
mother
crooning
to
her
child
while
her
master
smoked
the
with
the
clay
bowl
and
ruminated
over
the
events
of
the
day
the
villainy
of
the
landlord
who
contemplated
the
raising
of
the
rent
and
the
still
greater
rascality
of
the
landlord
who
insisted
upon
his
own
as
well
here
a
famished
cat
crouched
over
a
pile
of
garbage
hard
by
the
sweeper
there
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
a
marwadi
with
the
features
of
mephistopheles
dozed
over
his
account
book
and
a
little
further
away
a
naked
child
was
dipping
her
toes
in
a
pool
of
sullage
water
that
had
dripped
from
the
broken
pipe
athwart
the
house
wall
darkness
reigned
on
the
upper
floors
at
intervals
a
faint
glimmer
might
be
discerned
behind
the
sodden
which
shrouded
the
windows
and
once
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
voice
humming
a
refrain
from
an
indian
drama
jahan

thee
when
thou
hast
returned
may
god
give
thee
his
peace
the
singer
was
invisible
but
around
the
words
of
her
song
one
could
conjure
up
pictures
of
the
sturdy
serang
asleep
in
the
of
some
steamer
or
haply
of
the
bearded
trader
afare
through
the
passes
of
the
frontier
the
while
his
wife
in
the
small
upper
room
waited
with
prayers
for
his
even
as
the
lady
of
ithaca
waited
for
the
man
of
many
wiles
at
length
we
reached
a
small
doorway
which
opened
into
a
cavern
black
as
erebus
for
a
moment
we
paused
undecided
and
then
out
of
the
darkness
crawled
an
aged
mahomedan
bearing
a
tiny
lamp
lifting
it
above
his
head
he
pointed
silently
to
a
rickety
staircase
in
the
far
corner
up
which
we
groped
our
way
with
the
help
of
a
rope
pendent
from
an
upper
beam
up
and
up
we
mounted
now
round
a
sharp
corner
now
down
a
narrow
passage
the
stairs
swayed
and
shook
the
air
was
heavy
with
a
mixture
of
frankincense
and
sullage
until
at
last
we
crawled
through
a
that
opened
as
by
magic
and
found
ourselves
at
our
end
illustration
fateh
muhammad
imagine
a
small
attic
some
fifteen
feet
by
ten
under
the
very
eaves
of
the
filled
with
the
smoke
of
frankincense
so
pungent
that
the
eyes
at
once
commenced
to
water
nor
ceased
until
we
were
once
again
in
the
open
air
in
one
corner
was
spread
a
coarse
sheet
with
a
couple
of
pillows
against
the
wall
upon
which
the
silent
mahomedan
bade
us
by
a
sign
recline
in
the
opposite
corner
a
a
species
of
altar
smothered
in
jasmine
wreaths
and
surmounted
by
a
bunch
of
peacock
feathers
and
immediately
in
front
of
this
an
earthen
brazier
of
live
charcoal
behind
the
brazier
sat
three
persons
fateh
muhammad
a
musalman
youth
with
curiously
large
and
dreamy
eyes
and
two
old
musalman
beldames
either
of
whom
might
have
sat
as
a
model
for
the
witch
of
endor
the
three
sat
unmoved
blinking
into
the
live
charcoal
save
at
rare
intervals
when
the
elder
of
the
two
women
cast
a
handful
of
fragrance
upon
the
brazier
and
wrapped
us
all
in
a
fresh
pall
of
smoke
which
billowed
round
the
room
and
lapped
the
interstices
of
the
rotten
tiles
only
the
peacock
eyes
in
the
corner
never
lost
their
lustre
staring
wickedly
through
the
like
the
head
of
argus
then
on
a
sudden
the
youth
shivered
fell
forward
with
his
face
over
the
brazier
and
rose
again
to
a
sitting
posture
with
eyes
closed
and
every
muscle
in
his
body
taut
as
though
stricken
by
a
sudden
paralysis
the
spirit
has
entered
whispered
my
friend
and
even
as
he
spoke
i
saw
the
youth
throat
working
as
if
an
unseen
hand
were
kneading
the
muscles
and
forth
from
his
lips
echoed
the
words
la
illaha
illallah
illahi
laho
he
was
deep
in
a
trance
the
curtains
of
his
eyes
looking
as
one
that
is
dead
and
the
voice
with
which
he
spoke
was
not
the
voice
of
fateh
muhammad
la
illaha
illallah
illahi
laho
and
as
the
words
died
away
one
that
was
present
passed
two
green
limes
into
his
left
hand
and
asked
for
a
sign
i
am
fain
to
journey
to
lahore
starting
on
tuesday
next
will
it
be
well
he
said
and
after
a
pause
came
the
answer
set
not
forth
on
tuesday
for
the
stars
be
against
thy
journeying
but
send
thine
agent
on
thursday
and
go
thyself
if
need
be
two
days
later
as
the
message
died
away
the
in
the
floor
was
slowly
tilted
upwards
and
through
the
opening
crawled
an
obvious
member
of
the
dhobi
class
he
slid
forward
almost
to
the
feet
of
the
dreaming
youth
and
placing
as
before
two
green
limes
in
his
hand
spoke
saying
master
my
wife
hath
written
from
our
country
bidding
me
to
go
unto
her
nor
tarry
by
the
road
but
there
is
work
toward
here
and
the
purse
is
light
is
it
that
i
should
go
la
illaha
illallah
illahi
laho
aye
go
unto
her
lest
evil
haply
befall
thee
for
much
is
there
that
is
hid
from
thine
eyes
thus
the
seance
went
forward
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
odd
waifs
and
strays
of
humanity
crawled
in
through
the
obtained
their
message
of
good
or
ill
and
departed
into
the
shadows
as
silently
as
they
had
come
among
them
were
several
women
one
of
whom
sought
a
cure
for
her
sick
child
whimpering
over
the
symptoms
of
his
malady
meningitis
i
expect
muttered
my
friend
the
doctor
but
the
answer
came
swift
and
sure
bind
thou
the
round
his
brows
and
carry
him
to
the
shrine
of
miran
datar
whence
cometh
thy
help
la
illaha
illallah
illahi
laho
the
end
came
suddenly
after
the
last
visitor
had
vanished
through
the
floor
there
was
dead
silence
for
three
minutes
while
fateh
muhammad
wrestled
with
the
spirit
within
him
and
then
with
chest
heaving
and
hands
convulsively
grasping
the
heavy
air
he
fell
prone
upon
his
face
and
lay
still
the
two
old
women
moved
forward
and
commenced
making
passes
over
his
body
murmuring
the
while
some
charm
and
as
they
waved
the
handkerchief
above
his
head
he
regained
consciousness
and
sat
slowly
up
breathing
like
one
that
hath
an
evil
dream
and
bearing
upon
his
features
the
signs
of
deathly
fatigue
by
this
time
the
attic
was
almost
clear
of
smoke
the
guttering
wick
of
the
only
was
nearly
burnt
through
and
fateh
muhammad
was
fain
to
sleep
wherefore
we
thanked
him
for
permitting
us
this
glance
behind
the
curtain
of
his
daily
life
then
crawled
through
the
trap
slid
down
the
reeking
staircase
and
gained
the
street
one
last
glance
as
my
eyes
reached
the
of
the
trap
showed
me
that
the
room
was
untenanted
save
by
the
prostrate
form
of
the
visionary
above
whom
the
eyes
of
the
peacock
still
glinted
with
something
of
mockery
in
their
blue
depths
as
we
passed
homewards
down
the
street
we
heard
the
woman
in
the
upper
chamber
still
singing
her
prayer
but
with
a
note
of
hope
in
its
cadence
o
dilruba
tu
gam
na
kho
khuda
hamen
baham
kare
janejahan
bhulo
nahi
karim
sada
karam

grieve
not
heart
of
my
heart
for
god
will
order
our
meeting
soul
of
the
world
forget
not
and
may
the
peace
of
god
be
on
us
twain
perchance
she
also
like
fateh
muhammad
guests
had
caught
a
message
of
good
hap
from
out
the
darkness
and
so
back
to
the
light
and
the
noise
of
the
city
greatest
artery
xx
the
tilak
riots
a
reminiscence
affairs
in
the
city
may
now
be
regarded
as
having
resumed
their
normal
course
and
the
chance
of
further
disorder
seems
for
the
present
to
have
been
obviated
one
of
the
most
curious
features
of
the
disturbances
was
the
difference
of
feeling
exhibited
by
the
two
classes
of
namely
the
ghatis
and
the
malwanis
of
the
whole
one
would
have
assumed
that
the
kunbis
from
the
deccan
where
tilak
is
stated
to
have
so
great
a
following
would
have
shown
a
greater
disposition
to
riot
in
consequence
of
his
arrest
and
conviction
than
the
men
from
ratnagiri
and
yet
so
far
as
i
could
judge
the
ghatis
were
far
less
interested
in
the
trial
and
were
much
less
disposed
to
express
their
resentment
than
the
latter
class
which
comprises
one
or
two
extremely
and
uncompromising
individuals
the
ghatis
of
sewri
indeed
at
the
very
height
of
the
riots
informed
an
englishman
with
whom
they
are
familiar
that
they
would
sooner
die
for
him
than
do
him
any
harm
and
their
words
carried
home
the
conviction
that
they
felt
no
personal
sorrow
at
tilak
fate
and
that
they
would
be
ready
in
an
emergency
as
they
have
often
been
in
past
history
to
stand
staunchly
by
the
side
of
any
individual
whom
they
know
and
who
has
been
kind
to
them
the
attitude
of
the
ratnagiri
hands
must
in
my
opinion
have
been
engendered
by
continuous
and
careful
tuition
and
this
was
particularly
the
case
in
the
currey
road
and
delisle
road
areas
where
agents
belonging
to
their
own
native
district
had
been
suborned
by
the
seditionary
party
to
stir
up
trouble
no
less
remarkable
was
the
quaint
juxtaposition
during
the
height
of
the
riots
of
seething
disorder
and
the
quiet
prosecution
of
their
daily
avocations
by
the
bulk
of
the
people
an
officer
of
one
of
the
regiments
quartered
on
the
city
during
the
trial
in
the
high
court
gave
expression
to
this
fact
in
the
following
words
warfare
i
understand
but
this
sort
of
business
beats
me
altogether
at
the
top
of
the
street
there
is
a
native
with
people
singing
and
beating
down
the
street
there
are
and
firing
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
there
are
people
europeans
and
natives
shopping
he
was
struck
as
i
was
by
the
incongruity
of
the
whole
business
at
jacob
circle
there
was
a
great
display
of
military
and
magisterial
strength
tommy
atkins
had
taken
up
a
strong
position
at
the
corner
of
clerk
road
sentries
paced
up
and
down
by
day
and
night
machine
guns
gaped
upon
the
fountain
erected
to
the
memory
of
le
grand
jacob
at
intervals
a
squadron
of
cavalry
dashed
into
the
open
halted
for
a
space
and
then
as
suddenly
disappeared
and
they
were
followed
by
motor
cars
and
carriages
containing
commissioners
deputy
commissioners
police
subordinates
special
magistrates
and
miscellaneous
european
sightseers
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
law
and
order
were
represented
there
and
there
could
scarcely
have
been
a
greater
display
of
armed
force
more
secret
consultations
more
wild
dashes
hither
and
thither
more
troubled
parleying
if
the
entire
city
north
of
circle
had
been
in
flames
and
yet
behind
it
and
around
it
the
daily
life
of
the
people
moved
forward
in
its
accustomed
channel
the
at
the
corner
had
its
full
complement
of
patrons
and
the
bhandari
himself
might
be
seen
pulling
out
handfuls
of
parched
grain
for
those
of
his
customers
who
desired
a
relish
with
their
liquor
members
of
that
degraded
class
which
follows
one
of
the
immemorial
vices
of
the
east
wandered
round
the
marwaris
shops
begging
and
clapping
their
hands
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
them
and
across
the
diameter
of
the
circle
strayed
a
group
of
barots
those
strange
looking
men
from
kathiawar
who
act
as
priests
and
magicians
to
the
bhangi
population
seeing
the
military
and
police
they
halted
for
a
moment
and
gave
one
time
to
have
a
word
with
them
whither
go
ye
we
asked
and
they
replied
that
they
were
bound
to
the
big
bhangi
settlement
that
lies
not
far
from
the
circle
one
of
them
carried
a
bina
a
second
an
ordinary
covered
with
crude
cabalistic
signs
and
a
third
a
rude
book
something
like
a
vani
chopda
filled
with
marathi
characters
which
doubtless
plays
a
part
in
the
and
that
form
the
of
these
wandering
hierophants
hardly
had
they
disappeared
than
four
sadhus
hove
in
sight
one
of
them
who
was
smeared
with
ashes
from
head
to
foot
the
lobes
of
whose
ears
had
been
pierced
and
dragged
down
till
they
nearly
touched
his
shoulders
and
who
wore
an
enormous
rosary
of
rudraksha
berries
acted
as
the
spokesman
of
the
party
and
stated
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
nasik
they
had
come
from
benares
he
said
and
had
spent
a
week
in
the
shady
compound
of
the
mahalaksmi
temple
where
all
the
bairagis
gosavis
and
fakirs
of
the
indian
continent
from
time
to
time
congregate
do
you
walk
to
nasik
or
go
by
rail
we
asked
by
rail
replied
the
but
surely
the
true
sadhu
should
walk
taking
no
heed
of
or
whereat
the
little
fat
ascetic
with
the
gourd
smiled
pleasantly
and
made
some
remark
to
the
effect
that
all
methods
of
conveyance
are
permitted
to
the
truly
devout
so
they
passed
down
ripon
road
towards
the
heart
of
the
city
followed
a
couple
of
muhammadan
kasais
driving
a
small
flock
of
sheep
dyed
pink
and
blue
in
patches
which
they
urged
forward
in
approved
native
fashion
by
driving
the
fingers
into
the
base
of
the
hindmost
animal
spine
and
after
them
wandered
a
syed
in
a
faded
green
silk
robe
and
cap
carrying
the
inevitable
peacock
feather
brush
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
exorcism
and
divination
later
in
the
day
a
hindu
hurried
past
on
her
way
home
and
four
youths
of
the
who
had
left
their
legal
studies
in
the
fort
to
see
what
was
toward
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
island
a
municipal
sweeper
lurched
across
the
open
and
proceeded
to
spend
twenty
minutes
in
brushing
the
grating
of
a
drain
leaving
the
accumulated
filth
of
the
adjoining
gutter
to
fester
and
pollute
the
surroundings
and
two
elderly
each
carrying
a
phenomenal
of
cakes
becoming
suddenly
aware
of
the
presence
of
troops
and
thereby
struck
with
terror
collided
violently
with
one
another
and
shot
the
entire
contents
of
their
baskets
on
to
the
road
this
caused
some
amusement
to
the
particularly
to
a
pathan
who
had
just
taken
a
very
complete
bath
under
one
of
the
taps
of
the
memorial
fountain
but
the
trouble
was
soon
mended
by
a
small
boy
who
bribed
by
the
offer
of
one
dung
cake
helped
the
old
ladies
to
repack
their
burdens
and
replace
them
on
their
heads
next
came
a
swarthy
gentleman
from
palanpur
who
said
he
was
a
hawker
of
glass
and
produced
one
bowl
without
a
top
as
proof
of
his
profession
he
struck
me
as
being
uncommonly
and
perhaps
designedly
vacant
in
speech
and
appearance
and
seemed
to
have
no
stock
of
glassware
whatever
i
am
still
wondering
whether
that
topless
bowl
was
really
his
own
or
whether
he
may
not
have
filched
it
from
some
convenient
meanwhile
the
irani
at
the
corner
where
the
trams
halt
did
a
roaring
trade
he
must
have
boiled
his
four
and
five
times
over
in
order
to
supply
the
constant
demands
for
adha
kop
preferred
by
casual
visitors
who
had
come
up
out
of
the
city
to
see
what
was
going
on
memons
bohras
khojas
jews
eurasians
and
europeans
all
patronized
his
shop
during
the
days
of
tumult
and
the
amount
of
and
raspberryade
which
was
consumed
was
phenomenal
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
watch
the
constant
stream
of
people
who
came
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
soldiers
and
to
hear
their
remarks
on
the
situation
i
have
heard
one
of
them
would
begin
and
then
followed
a
string
of
the
wildest
rumours
interspersed
with
many
a
tobah
fie
honestly
or
truly
or
mag
kai
what
happened
next
which
apparently
produced
such
a
hunger
and
thirst
that
the
irani
thanking
his
stars
for
the
outbreak
of
disorder
had
to
ransack
all
his
cases
for
comestibles
aerated
waters
and
tea
they
sat
in
deep
attention
when
motor
car
no
o
swung
out
of
de
lisle
road
and
halted
near
the
fountain
they
watched
with
animation
the
punjab
cavalry
trot
homewards
to
their
lines
after
a
scurry
in
kalachauki
and
they
burst
into
merriment
when
a
refractory
mule
deposited
one
of
the
northampton
regiment
plump
in
the
muddiest
portion
of
the
circle
they
had
a
thoroughly
interesting
week
these
but
not
half
so
interesting
as
he
did
who
watched
them
and
chatted
with
them
and
spent
hours
interrogating
the
human
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
this
city
of
a
myriad
castes
